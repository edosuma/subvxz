00:00.083 --> 00:01.951
<i>Previously, on "Shades of Blue"...</i>

00:01.952 --> 00:03.419
Dropped him off at school.
Something wasn't right.

00:03.421 --> 00:04.920
- My boy is in danger.
- I agree.

00:04.922 --> 00:07.459
His mother slings an assault
rifle for a drug lord.

00:07.461 --> 00:10.072
You weren't supposed to look
in this bag here, were you?

00:10.074 --> 00:11.742
- This wasn't in here before.
- Hey.

00:11.796 --> 00:15.025
- You want him to stay inside.
- A weapons charge ensures that.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.601
Go near my daughter again and
nobody will ever find you.

00:19.603 --> 00:20.936
You're gonna want to wear your
best suit tomorrow

00:20.938 --> 00:23.559
- for your disciplinary hearing.
- There's gonna be blood.

00:23.561 --> 00:26.041
They say there's a bullet
waiting for us all.

00:26.043 --> 00:27.859
I've been looking for your boyfriend.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.912
Where's Bianchi?

00:29.914 --> 00:31.947
- He's in Italy.
- I killed him.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.016
He threatened me.
He threatened Cristina.

00:34.018 --> 00:36.752
<i>And I snapped his neck. Stahl knows.</i>

00:36.754 --> 00:39.588
<i>Caddie could have led Stahl
straight to his body.</i>

00:39.590 --> 00:43.091
Mrs. Saperstein, the numbers
54-4-F mean anything to you?

00:43.093 --> 00:44.726
That's the plot where he's buried.

00:44.728 --> 00:46.962
Are you gay? Because every
time you look at me,

00:46.964 --> 00:48.764
you see something you hate
about yourself.

00:48.766 --> 00:50.766
You ever bring this up again,

00:50.768 --> 00:53.702
it'll be the last conversation
you and I have.

00:53.704 --> 00:55.774
Yeah, is that a punishment or a reward?

01:00.177 --> 01:01.710
Woz, get down!

01:01.712 --> 01:03.312
Got to get him to the hospital!

01:06.183 --> 01:11.215
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

01:13.657 --> 01:16.391
Anything out of the ordinary
when you entered the house?

01:16.393 --> 01:17.492
No.

01:17.517 --> 01:19.428
Can you give me a guess about
the number of shooters?

01:19.430 --> 01:21.029
- No.
- And were you able to see

01:21.031 --> 01:23.031
or hear any of the gunmen
when you escaped?

01:23.033 --> 01:24.833
Hey! Not here.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.835
There's a press perimeter
around the corner.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.705
Captain McManus will be around
in a few minutes with an update.

01:32.643 --> 01:35.177
Any distinctive marks on their vehicle?

01:35.179 --> 01:37.779
Look, I didn't see them.
I didn't see the vehicle.

01:37.781 --> 01:39.748
Bullets were flying, and
we were pinned down.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.583
Do you know anybody that would
want to do you harm,

01:41.585 --> 01:44.186
or do Lieutenant Wozniak harm?

01:44.188 --> 01:46.455
Detective Santos? What?

01:46.457 --> 01:47.756
Anybody who would want to do you

01:47.758 --> 01:49.725
or Lieutenant Wozniak harm?

01:49.727 --> 01:51.860
It's a big city.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.596
What, are you planning to move
a body tonight?

01:54.598 --> 01:57.866
I was supposed to pick up a load

01:57.868 --> 02:00.702
of fertilizer for the Brooklyn
Community Garden tomorrow.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.205
No good deed, right?

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.057 --> 02:22.124
- Detective Santos.
- Captain.

02:22.126 --> 02:23.492
- Any news?
- No.

02:23.494 --> 02:25.260
Woz is in there getting it now.

02:25.262 --> 02:27.296
The spleen is part of your
son's immune system.

02:27.298 --> 02:29.865
Since we had to remove it
to stop the bleeding,

02:29.867 --> 02:32.834
his ability to fight infection,
especially when he gets

02:32.836 --> 02:35.103
a little older, may be compromised.

02:35.105 --> 02:38.640
But that can be mitigated with
prophylactic antibiotics.

02:38.642 --> 02:40.742
So he could live a normal
life without it?

02:40.744 --> 02:43.078
Normal, full, productive.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.746
You got him here quickly,
which allowed us

02:44.748 --> 02:46.511
to stop the hemorrhaging.

02:46.513 --> 02:48.951
That's what made the difference.
Well, thanks, Doc.

02:48.953 --> 02:50.585
- You're welcome.
- Appreciate it.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.572
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

03:00.631 --> 03:02.165
It's okay.

03:06.637 --> 03:09.104
You're gonna hunt these shooters down.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.973
- Promise me...
- Yeah, I promise.

03:10.975 --> 03:13.075
- You're gonna get 'em.
- I'm gonna get 'em.

03:13.077 --> 03:14.428
It was my house.

03:15.813 --> 03:17.779
It was my son.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.979
We found a dark sedan with
bullet holes and fresh blood

03:50.981 --> 03:52.681
parked 15 blocks from your house.

03:52.683 --> 03:53.648
ESU on the way?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.717
Canine, tactical, the works.

03:55.719 --> 03:57.786
Take care of your family.
We'll flush 'em out.

03:57.788 --> 03:59.187
Thank you, Captain.

03:59.189 --> 04:01.223
You too, Detective. Go home.

04:01.225 --> 04:03.977
We have the entire department
looking for these shooters.

04:06.063 --> 04:07.481
One inch.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.092
One inch between my son living or dying.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.526
Take it.

04:12.202 --> 04:14.169
Look, wait here with Linda.
They're gonna find these guys.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.303
No, we are finding those cowards.

04:16.305 --> 04:17.783
Our unit.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.374
All right, I'll tell the crew

04:19.375 --> 04:20.608
to keep their ear on the scanner.

04:20.611 --> 04:21.576
No, you go with them.

04:21.577 --> 04:23.245
Look, I'm with you, Woz, but we still

04:23.247 --> 04:24.713
have that chore to do tonight.

04:24.715 --> 04:25.957
No, we don't.

04:26.950 --> 04:28.283
Visit Saperstein?

04:28.285 --> 04:29.718
Stahl has the plot number.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.962
It's handled.

04:31.388 --> 04:33.955
How many times do I need
to prove it to you?

04:33.957 --> 04:36.158
I have your back.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.554
There's a low-rent high-rise
about 50 yards

05:21.556 --> 05:23.122
away from the abandoned car.

05:23.124 --> 05:24.924
Nobody's getting any sleep
in that building tonight.

05:24.926 --> 05:27.760
Who even has the balls to come
after us like that?

05:27.762 --> 05:30.863
- My gut says mob.
- Or our new favorite drug lord.

05:30.865 --> 05:33.566
Hard to mastermind a massacre
from inside a holding cell.

05:33.568 --> 05:36.535
Quince does get a phone call.
We set him up.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.038
Tufo, you stay here and get
any information

05:39.040 --> 05:40.706
back from command to Woz.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.941
Harlee, go this way. Come on.

05:41.943 --> 05:44.877
You try to go out there, the
press is gonna eat you alive.

05:44.879 --> 05:46.479
I'll meet you guys up there.

05:46.481 --> 05:47.480
All right, Loman, you're with me.

05:47.482 --> 05:48.707
All right.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.950
Any leads?

05:50.952 --> 05:52.485
Blood and bullets.

05:52.487 --> 05:54.309
Could you take Cristina home?

05:54.376 --> 05:56.440
Harlee, you got the whole city
looking for these guys.

05:56.464 --> 06:00.192
I know. We're posting a patrol
unit outside my place.

06:00.844 --> 06:02.349
Please don't leave till
I get there, all right?

06:02.351 --> 06:04.263
I was planning on waiting for you.

06:04.723 --> 06:05.765
You're leaving?

06:06.141 --> 06:08.900
Yeah. Nate's gonna make it.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.236
Where are you going?

06:10.770 --> 06:12.666
Well, I have to find who did this.

06:12.668 --> 06:15.007
There's like a gazillion cops
here who can do that.

06:15.734 --> 06:18.608
Look, I know you're scared,
but everything's gonna be okay.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.392
Nothing's okay, Mom.
You just got shot at.

06:22.757 --> 06:26.027
Nate almost died.
That could have been you.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.985
- It wasn't.
- I mean, who are these people?

06:27.987 --> 06:29.921
Why are they shooting at
Uncle Woz's house?

06:29.923 --> 06:33.090
That's why I have to go, okay?
I want you to...

06:33.092 --> 06:34.836
I am not going to Aunt Gemma's.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.996
To let James take you home.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.731
A patrol unit will guard the house.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.300
Because you just want me to be safe?

06:42.302 --> 06:43.768
- Yes.
- Well, please stop saying that

06:43.770 --> 06:45.870
and actually do it.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.122
Thank God.

07:05.450 --> 07:07.058
I must have said my first Hail Mary

07:07.060 --> 07:09.393
in about 20 years on the way over here.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.295
Did you remember the words?

07:11.297 --> 07:13.130
Spent a lot of time in confession.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.466
Thank you for coming.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.468
But you should stay clear.

07:18.255 --> 07:21.572
Once we confirm that this was
Bianchi's handiwork,

07:21.574 --> 07:24.798
I'm going after him for keeps.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.009
So beef up your security
and watch your back.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.641
Understood.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.583
But first, you need to go
to the precinct.

07:32.936 --> 07:36.020
Now. Your locked filing cabinet.

07:36.564 --> 07:38.489
Little black book you used

07:38.491 --> 07:40.958
to keep track of your protection racket?

07:40.960 --> 07:43.094
All the dealers on your roster...

07:43.096 --> 07:46.063
Julia, my son is hooked up to machines.

07:46.065 --> 07:49.233
I know, Matt, but you have to
relocate that book,

07:49.235 --> 07:51.002
and anything else you don't want

07:51.004 --> 07:53.237
the rat squad to get their claws on.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.306
It's 3:00 in the morning.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.875
It's a good time for a search.

07:57.877 --> 08:00.511
Do you have an in with Internal Affairs?

08:00.513 --> 08:03.047
It's amazing what you hear
when people believe

08:03.049 --> 08:05.783
you have a 40% chance of
becoming the next Mayor.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.852
That is, unless your old crew

08:07.854 --> 08:11.349
gets burned at the stake a week
before the election.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.853
I'll tell Linda you had an emergency.

08:16.730 --> 08:17.995
Hey, guys?

08:18.690 --> 08:20.531
Come on, we got to take a drive.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.636
Man, they weren't kidding with this.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.760
"Turn the whole city upside-down" thing.

08:28.078 --> 08:30.744
Yeah, well you shoot at cops,
we all fire back.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.410
Street Crimes Unit from the 6-4.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.613
We were the targets.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.148
It's gonna take ESU hours

08:37.150 --> 08:39.246
to clear this building door to door.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.195
How much blood did they say
was in the car?

08:59.197 --> 09:01.030
Scanner said a pool.

09:01.032 --> 09:03.299
You have a report a gunshot
wound at the hospital, but...

09:03.301 --> 09:04.868
Should I call tactical over?

09:04.870 --> 09:07.822
Like you said. We return fire.

09:08.615 --> 09:10.306
You take the back.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.106
Police!

09:35.108 --> 09:36.741
Hey, don't shoot!

09:36.743 --> 09:38.610
- He made me help!
- What's your name, Doc?

09:38.612 --> 09:40.445
- Henry.
- Henry, I'm gonna need you

09:40.447 --> 09:41.613
to keep him alive for a while.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.981
This man needs an ambulance.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.549
No, not until he gives us some answers.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.150
He's lost a lot of blood.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.986
I can buy you five more minutes.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.754
I'm not talking without a lawyer.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.845
You're not gonna need a lawyer
if you're dead.

09:51.847 --> 09:53.625
Start talking or bleed out.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.468
Yo, what are you doing?

10:03.470 --> 10:06.016
- That's our prisoner.
- Was your prisoner.

10:06.018 --> 10:09.134
Now a material witness in an
Internal Affairs investigation.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.227
Heard y'all had a bad night.

10:12.229 --> 10:14.128
You're in for a bad tomorrow too.

10:14.130 --> 10:16.898
Don't drop the soap, Quince.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.800
You, whatever that is, put it down.

10:18.802 --> 10:20.807
You know, I have a warrant
to search the premises.

10:20.809 --> 10:22.704
Officer Loman! O...

10:22.706 --> 10:24.873
We were ambushed last night.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.809
My son hasn't been out of
surgery for two hours.

10:27.811 --> 10:30.398
I met Nate. I'm sorry. He's a good egg.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.200
But the fact that you're here in
the wee hours of the morning

10:32.202 --> 10:34.108
makes me all that much more curious.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.266
We're tracking down leads

10:35.268 --> 10:37.501
for who might have tried to kill us.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.670
Or you're here to further intimidate

10:39.672 --> 10:42.039
a false arrest more than
you already have.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.241
You know, your man Quince
told me a sordid tale

10:44.243 --> 10:46.210
about you, a goodie bag
full of narcotics,

10:46.212 --> 10:48.012
and one nasty frame job.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.381
And a tale is exactly what it is.

10:50.758 --> 10:52.917
Quince is a street thug
trying to get out of prison.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.686
But it's very fitting that you
take the side of a dealer

10:55.688 --> 10:58.956
who uses a kid to move his product

10:58.958 --> 11:00.858
instead of the badge
who brought them down.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.328
Lieutenant, wearing the badge
doesn't make you a good guy.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.263
As a matter of fact, wearing
that badge and doing dirt

11:06.265 --> 11:09.269
makes you the worst kind of bad guy.

11:09.271 --> 11:12.322
You know what, we've heard
this so many times before...

11:12.324 --> 11:14.483
I may not be able to get you
for Donnie Pomp's disappearance,

11:14.507 --> 11:18.208
but on this... good old-fashioned
obstruction... you're mine.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.478
Your poker face is as bad
as your actual face.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.448
You may not like my face.
That's okay. We're not dating.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.217
You may not like my face,
Lieutenant, but I've got you.

11:27.219 --> 11:30.020
I've got hard evidence of you
planting narcotics

11:30.022 --> 11:31.154
and weapons on a minor.

11:31.156 --> 11:34.886
Anything else I find here is gravy.

11:39.657 --> 11:40.436
Toss it.

11:40.563 --> 11:42.009
Let's start with a name. All right?

11:42.034 --> 11:44.721
Any name. How about yours?
I don't! I can't...

11:44.746 --> 11:46.479
He's gonna pass out from the pain.

11:46.481 --> 11:47.947
No, hold off on the doggie morphine

11:47.949 --> 11:49.749
until he tells us who paid him
to kill us.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.451
We get that, and the pain stops.

11:51.453 --> 11:54.387
I didn't shoot at anybody...!

11:54.389 --> 11:56.032
Okay, my cousin!

11:57.392 --> 12:00.760
Called me and some other guys
two days ago.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.764
5 grand a piece up front,
5 more after the job was done.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.399
So they told you to shoot at cops?

12:06.401 --> 12:07.931
He's hemorrhaging.

12:07.956 --> 12:08.835
- I can't stop it.
- You were saying?

12:08.837 --> 12:10.255
You were saying?

12:11.406 --> 12:15.608
The plan was to go inside...
inside the house, but...!

12:15.610 --> 12:17.677
Jordan's idiot buddy showed up tweaking.

12:17.679 --> 12:19.597
He was all jumpy.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.081
He fired too early, before we were set.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.601
Jordan's your cousin?

12:24.186 --> 12:26.986
- Where did he get the cash?
- I swear!

12:26.988 --> 12:29.174
- I don't know.
- Where can we find Jordan?

12:29.694 --> 12:30.823
If anything went wrong,

12:30.825 --> 12:32.780
the plan was to meet there
tomorrow morning.

12:32.782 --> 12:34.827
Where?

12:36.965 --> 12:38.591
Tick-tock.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.011
The shooters are supposed to meet

12:43.013 --> 12:44.513
at the Queens Travel Suites
Hotel in 20 minutes.

12:44.515 --> 12:47.049
<i>- You called it in?
- It's a rally point.</i>

12:47.051 --> 12:48.583
We don't know how many shooters
there are total.

12:48.585 --> 12:49.618
We need the backup.

12:49.620 --> 12:53.070
Don't let the tactical
commander box you out.

12:53.072 --> 12:56.458
'Cause every cop in the city's
gonna want in on this collar.

12:56.460 --> 12:58.260
I got it.

12:58.262 --> 13:00.462
Look, has Nate come out of
the anesthesia yet?

13:00.464 --> 13:03.365
I'm headed back to the hospital soon.

13:03.891 --> 13:05.634
Wait, back? Where are you?

13:05.636 --> 13:07.979
Just call me after the takedown.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.405
All right, you think Verco is bluffing?

13:10.407 --> 13:14.009
He wouldn't jam us up on
a dealer's say-so alone.

13:14.011 --> 13:16.211
He said he had hard evidence.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.547
I mean, maybe he has surveillance photos

13:18.549 --> 13:21.516
of us setting Quince up.

13:25.022 --> 13:27.255
Should I call my union rep?

13:27.257 --> 13:30.483
No, call your CI.

13:30.485 --> 13:31.841
What informant?

13:31.843 --> 13:34.596
The one who introduced you to Quince.

13:34.598 --> 13:36.598
The woman with the kid.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.234
- Karen? Karen wasn't a CI.
- She is now.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.036
Get her to go on record

13:41.038 --> 13:43.805
saying that she was our CI all along.

13:43.807 --> 13:48.243
The guns, the drugs, they were
all Quince's to begin with.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.578
If the charges don't stick,

13:49.580 --> 13:51.346
he'll find out that she helped us.

13:51.348 --> 13:53.415
He'll come after her.
He'll come after the kid.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.150
She won't want to do it.

13:55.152 --> 13:57.385
Suspects are on the sixth
floor, room 611.

13:57.387 --> 13:59.187
- Intel solid?
- Best we have.

13:59.697 --> 14:01.056
We go up both stairwells.

14:01.058 --> 14:02.858
We hit 'em fast, we hit 'em hard.

14:02.860 --> 14:04.559
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

14:04.561 --> 14:06.695
I ain't gonna lie.

14:06.697 --> 14:08.797
I kind of hope one of 'em
goes for a gun.

14:08.799 --> 14:10.565
As long as his name is not Jordan.

14:10.567 --> 14:13.294
He's the only link that ties
this back to Bianchi.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.649
- Police! Hands up!
- Police! Hands up!

14:27.651 --> 14:29.718
- Hey!
- Hands up, now!

14:29.720 --> 14:31.319
Put your hands up!

14:37.094 --> 14:39.427
That's one way to make a trail go cold.

14:39.429 --> 14:41.463
<i>Police officers know
that they face the risk</i>

14:41.465 --> 14:42.731
<i>of danger when they work a shift,</i>

14:42.733 --> 14:46.468
<i>but for a group of criminals
to plan an ambush...</i>

14:47.504 --> 14:49.956
Good morning, Agent Gupta.

14:50.741 --> 14:52.908
Double shot, no foam, right?

14:52.910 --> 14:54.409
I had one already.

14:54.411 --> 14:56.111
Well, aren't you eager to start the day?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.346
Can I help you with something?

14:58.348 --> 14:59.614
I was hoping that you could,

14:59.616 --> 15:01.650
pull a DNA report

15:01.652 --> 15:03.685
so I can compare it to a new sample.

15:03.687 --> 15:05.554
His name is Miguel Zepeda.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.522
Recently released from New York State.

15:07.524 --> 15:08.957
And you can't put in a written request

15:08.959 --> 15:11.293
with the case number because...

15:11.295 --> 15:13.762
I'd rather owe you drinks.

15:13.764 --> 15:16.232
Maybe if you clean those fingernails.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.835
Yeah. I was working in the garden.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.697
In October?

15:23.307 --> 15:25.074
It's good to plan ahead.

15:26.677 --> 15:30.663
Well, Zepeda was a bust.

15:31.582 --> 15:34.683
That's impossible.
He's a convicted felon.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.785
He has to have a sample
in the state database.

15:36.787 --> 15:38.687
His conviction was vacated.

15:38.689 --> 15:40.789
State's obligated to destroy
every collected sample

15:40.791 --> 15:43.384
after an overturned conviction.

15:47.096 --> 15:48.347
Right.

15:55.272 --> 15:58.733
Hey, make it vanilla next time.

16:05.282 --> 16:06.948
Detective Tufo. Detective Loman.

16:06.950 --> 16:08.483
We need to holler at Karen for a minute.

16:08.485 --> 16:09.618
Karen ain't here.

16:10.155 --> 16:11.987
Girl saw on the news that
a bunch of cops got shot up,

16:11.989 --> 16:13.555
freaked out, and bounced.

16:13.557 --> 16:14.823
Said maybe it was Quince.

16:14.825 --> 16:16.625
Did she tell you where she was going?

16:16.627 --> 16:18.493
Just grabbed her stuff and
Adrian and bailed.

16:18.495 --> 16:20.262
Okay, when you do talk to her,
tell her it's urgent

16:20.264 --> 16:22.597
that we speak to her, like
end-of-the-world urgent.

16:22.599 --> 16:24.933
Her son's in danger.

16:24.935 --> 16:27.136
My baby's hungry.

16:37.314 --> 16:40.515
- Is he awake?
- Shh.

16:40.517 --> 16:44.487
Shh, he was... he was talking.

16:45.947 --> 16:50.859
But then they gave him medicine
for the pain, so...

16:50.861 --> 16:54.896
I got you a room at the hotel
across the street.

16:54.898 --> 16:57.599
Why don't you go over there
and get some rest?

16:57.601 --> 17:00.935
Matt, I know you have been up
for three days.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.605
Why don't you go lie down
before you fall down?

17:09.613 --> 17:11.613
I've been writing this kid

17:11.615 --> 17:14.392
rain checks and IOUs

17:16.520 --> 17:18.311
his whole life.

17:18.896 --> 17:21.648
You've always been his hero.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.327
Since he dressed up as a cop
on his sixth birthday.

17:26.904 --> 17:28.563
No matter what the two of you
have gone through.

17:28.565 --> 17:30.700
He may give you grief, but...

17:31.701 --> 17:36.338
he understands why you were gone
all of those nights.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.207
He's proud of you.

17:40.043 --> 17:41.836
Me too.

17:48.585 --> 17:50.385
Get better.

17:55.182 --> 17:57.525
- What's up?
- TSA finally came through

17:57.527 --> 17:58.793
with the travel files on Bianchi.

17:58.795 --> 17:59.728
Did he pass through customs?

17:59.730 --> 18:00.895
He never left.

18:00.897 --> 18:03.070
There's a man in JFK
airport security photos

18:03.072 --> 18:05.066
traveling as Michael Bianchi,
but it's not him.

18:05.068 --> 18:07.369
That doesn't exactly support his alibi.

18:07.371 --> 18:09.738
Bianchi's in town
and tracking this closely.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.940
We need to go to Greenpoint
Community Hospital.

18:11.942 --> 18:14.676
News just broke
our shooting suspect is there.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.045
- The only one still alive.
- This is exactly why

18:17.047 --> 18:18.947
I don't want you calling in every lead.

18:18.949 --> 18:21.116
Patrolmen can't keep their mouths shut.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.017
I leaked it.

18:23.377 --> 18:25.453
- What?
- Our shooting suspect is here.

18:25.455 --> 18:27.322
Not Greenpoint Community.

18:27.324 --> 18:28.957
Look, he and his buddies were
a bunch of amateurs

18:28.959 --> 18:30.792
that Bianchi knew he could dispose of,

18:30.794 --> 18:32.627
which is why the mob's clean-up
man delivered

18:32.629 --> 18:34.496
two bullets each
instead of their payday.

18:34.498 --> 18:36.030
Yeah, if he's watching the news,

18:36.032 --> 18:38.400
he now knows where
to send the other two.

18:38.402 --> 18:41.503
Like I said. Let's go for a drive.

18:47.944 --> 18:50.196
Looks like Karen's changed sides.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.784
We made a house call for you.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.244
I heard.

18:57.888 --> 18:59.888
So what's end-of-the-world urgent?

19:34.858 --> 19:38.214
Amazing how many things
the press gets wrong these days.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.741
If the investigation falls
apart, Quince will be released,

19:53.551 --> 19:55.859
which puts you and Adrian in danger.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.420
Stop pretending this is about
protecting me

19:58.422 --> 20:00.155
and my son, and not your own asses.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.457
If all we cared about was
protecting our own asses,

20:02.459 --> 20:04.593
we would have never helped you
in the first place.

20:04.595 --> 20:07.262
Yeah, your asses come first.

20:07.264 --> 20:08.564
Look, all we're asking you to do

20:08.566 --> 20:10.693
is say that you were working with us.

20:12.369 --> 20:13.569
Like a snitch?

20:13.571 --> 20:16.004
Just that you knew the handoff
was happening,

20:16.006 --> 20:17.950
and you called it in to us.

20:19.109 --> 20:22.744
Y'all are really working hard
to get me killed, man.

20:22.746 --> 20:24.046
It'll be a closed hearing.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.747
Okay? No one will ever know.

20:25.749 --> 20:27.543
You've got our word.

20:28.619 --> 20:29.985
Cop's word is only worth something

20:29.987 --> 20:31.787
when he's testifying against you.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.924
Hey, guys, should I add
tampering to the charges?

20:35.926 --> 20:38.994
We're talking to our CI, and
you are way out of line.

20:38.996 --> 20:40.662
Am I?

20:40.664 --> 20:44.427
You're feeding a potential
witness lies to parrot back.

20:44.429 --> 20:46.919
That's it. I'm calling your captain

20:46.921 --> 20:48.807
for an emergency GO-15 meeting.

20:49.123 --> 20:52.791
So ring your crew. Ring your union rep.

20:52.793 --> 20:56.530
Your pastor? 'Cause this ends right now.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.840
Don't suppose you want
to share your password.

21:08.842 --> 21:10.375
Phone seems to be locked.

21:10.377 --> 21:12.544
Is good cop, bad cop still a thing?

21:12.546 --> 21:15.981
Bad news is, we're fresh
out of good cops.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.183
You know the first thing that
they teach you on patrol?

21:18.185 --> 21:20.152
If you want to rough up a collar,

21:20.154 --> 21:22.888
you better not leave a mark,
or some fancy lawyer

21:22.890 --> 21:25.924
will tear you apart
back at the precinct.

21:29.163 --> 21:32.864
Something to think about as we drive.

21:34.868 --> 21:36.301
Hello?

21:59.326 --> 22:01.226
It can get stuffy back here.

22:01.228 --> 22:04.196
It's an old model.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.127
Before we say good-bye...

22:10.521 --> 22:13.930
Why don't I just cut off his thumb?

22:13.932 --> 22:17.367
Nice added feature.

22:17.369 --> 22:18.902
Are you sure this detour can't wait?

22:18.904 --> 22:20.570
Verco's out for blood.

22:20.572 --> 22:22.239
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't timely.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.909
Thank you, sir.

22:24.827 --> 22:27.037
Captain McManus is on his way up.

22:30.541 --> 22:32.445
Looks like somebody's got stage
fight, guys?

22:32.643 --> 22:36.578
You know, in the 16th Century,
when the English

22:36.580 --> 22:39.214
would catch pirates,
they'd force 'em to watch

22:39.216 --> 22:42.518
while they built gallows
during low tide.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.954
You see, they felt that
the anticipation of a hanging

22:45.956 --> 22:47.673
would heighten the experience.

22:47.725 --> 22:49.858
Come high tide,
the bodies would wash away.

22:49.860 --> 22:52.394
You could have used a few more
hugs when you were a kid.

22:52.396 --> 22:55.531
Spoiler alert, fellas: It's low tide.

22:55.533 --> 22:57.833
Here. What's that, guys?

22:57.835 --> 22:59.902
Planting narcotics?

22:59.904 --> 23:02.337
Planting, planting, planting narcotics.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.906
Planting narcotics. Here.

23:03.908 --> 23:06.375
Got excessive force, excessive force.

23:06.377 --> 23:07.843
It's a good day, guys?

23:07.845 --> 23:10.846
Most unforgivable of all...
look at this.

23:10.848 --> 23:13.557
Look at that. That's a kid.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.560
Placing a loaded weapon
in a child's backpack.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.720
- Hot shot?
- That wasn't a plant.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.418
Those were the possessions
of a shot caller

23:21.420 --> 23:23.278
who used kids as drug mules.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.479
We worked with Karen
to make a legit bust.

23:26.481 --> 23:28.128
We all know that story's gonna hold up

23:28.153 --> 23:30.466
like Kleenex in a rainstorm
when we get in that room.

23:30.851 --> 23:32.534
I know that you were only acting

23:32.536 --> 23:35.514
at the behest
of your fearless lieutenant.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.474
Confirm that, and I'll make Wozniak

23:38.476 --> 23:40.736
eat the whole crap sandwich.

23:43.114 --> 23:46.882
Forgot to mention I was
bringing a plus-one.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.285
Hey, Quincy.

23:54.125 --> 23:55.824
Last chance, guys.

23:55.826 --> 23:58.093
Storm is here.

23:58.095 --> 23:59.995
There won't be any survivors.

24:06.595 --> 24:09.104
Call Tommy, tell him to close
Murphy's for the day.

24:09.106 --> 24:10.798
Give me 15 minutes.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.074
All right, I'll go through
the rest of his contacts,

24:12.076 --> 24:14.094
see if I find anything on his phone

24:14.119 --> 24:15.218
where Bianchi's hiding. Yeah.

24:15.220 --> 24:18.107
And the rest we'll beat
out of him in the freezer.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.925
I have to say, Detectives:
This looks less than good.

24:21.927 --> 24:24.227
It'll look a lot better
when our CI explains

24:24.229 --> 24:26.797
that the drugs and the gun
belonged the dealer all along.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.347
Yeah, the bust was solid.

24:28.349 --> 24:29.900
Then why don't you have a CI contract?

24:29.902 --> 24:30.902
Or any paperwork on her?

24:31.288 --> 24:33.337
In her neighborhood, inking
a contract with us

24:33.339 --> 24:35.272
is the same as signing
her own death warrant.

24:35.274 --> 24:38.208
Without having it, it opens
you up to prosecution.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.976
- That's the whole point.
- I don't give a damn

24:39.978 --> 24:42.412
about paperwork, but I do need to hear

24:42.414 --> 24:43.980
what happened from your informant.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.315
So, where is she?

24:45.317 --> 24:48.618
- Ma'am, are you...
- Don't touch me.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.921
- Lieutenant, you should...
- Can I have the room, please?

24:55.994 --> 24:57.627
Hi, Karen.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.663
I ain't doing this.

25:01.100 --> 25:04.534
Y'all told me that I'd never
have to face him.

25:04.536 --> 25:06.036
That was out of our control.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.738
Exactly.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.450
You can't control nothing.

25:12.161 --> 25:15.122
You can't guarantee that you
gonna protect me and my boy.

25:16.206 --> 25:17.280
Can you?

25:17.833 --> 25:19.918
No, I can't.

25:24.339 --> 25:27.257
When Quince gets out,

25:28.171 --> 25:29.781
what you think he gonna do to me?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.842
What you think he gonna do to my son?

25:32.139 --> 25:34.141
If he's out on the street,

25:35.058 --> 25:37.311
he'll come after both of you.

25:39.771 --> 25:41.079
At least you're honest.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.535
I know you're scared.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.548
You don't know nothing.

25:43.550 --> 25:44.615
And you should be.

25:44.617 --> 25:46.153
Yeah, you damn right.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.451
I need to get back to my son.

25:55.195 --> 25:59.124
I didn't want to leave my son
today, either.

25:59.499 --> 26:04.212
But I left him,
bleeding in the hospital.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.506
You know why?

26:07.407 --> 26:10.808
Because until you kill the monster,

26:10.810 --> 26:13.680
it'll keep coming back.

26:14.806 --> 26:17.315
Yesterday, you told me that you wished

26:17.317 --> 26:19.311
you were a better parent.

26:20.479 --> 26:21.813
Right?

26:22.722 --> 26:25.356
Well, now's your chance.

26:25.901 --> 26:28.612
I missed my chance, Karen.

26:30.697 --> 26:32.824
Don't miss yours.

26:35.077 --> 26:36.845
You put me in a touch spot, gentlemen.

26:37.054 --> 26:40.209
I'm sorry, sir, our CI must
have just gotten cold feet.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.566
That's a child with a firearm.

26:42.876 --> 26:44.134
This is over the line.

26:44.136 --> 26:45.769
We got shot at last night.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.105
The city has our backs today.

26:47.145 --> 26:49.473
Do you really want the 6-4 back
on the front page tomorrow?

26:49.475 --> 26:51.441
Unfortunately, I have to make
a decision.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.277
And right now, there's only one

26:53.279 --> 26:54.639
version of the story on the table.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.978
Are you Miss Horne?

27:05.491 --> 27:07.491
I am.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.395
Don't wear yourself out.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.407
You have a long day ahead of you.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.334
Someone wants to meet up with you.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.829
Harlee!

27:20.072 --> 27:22.983
James. You're a nice surprise.

27:22.985 --> 27:24.993
I waited at your place
as long as I could,

27:25.018 --> 27:27.752
but Cristina insisted on going
to school for a test.

27:28.255 --> 27:31.223
Well, thank you.
You know, for everything.

27:31.225 --> 27:33.058
I had to advise on
a gun trafficking warrant.

27:33.060 --> 27:34.060
What's your excuse?

27:34.321 --> 27:35.724
Waiting on Woz...
he wants to interview

27:35.748 --> 27:37.611
a potential witness in Jersey City.

27:37.664 --> 27:39.704
Haven't you earned the right
to tap out for the day?

27:40.701 --> 27:42.934
Not when you're being shot at.

27:42.936 --> 27:44.336
Your daughter put on a brave face,

27:44.338 --> 27:45.637
but she was genuinely worried.

27:45.639 --> 27:47.606
I know it's none of my business,

27:47.608 --> 27:50.942
but I don't think she'd cry if
I made you both dinner tonight.

27:50.944 --> 27:52.529
No, but I might.

27:52.787 --> 27:54.946
Too much knight in shining armor
can be overwhelming, okay?

27:54.948 --> 27:56.911
I'll follow a recipe and everything.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.239
Okay, you want to be a hero?

27:58.263 --> 27:59.583
How about you start with takeout?

27:59.736 --> 28:02.789
Nothing says "I love you" like
burgers and ketchup packets.

28:04.476 --> 28:05.977
Because I do.

28:13.558 --> 28:15.792
I literally kicked my foot back.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.327
Like a cartoon.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.895
Wha... I won't tell.

28:18.897 --> 28:22.532
All right, get out of here.
I'll see you tonight.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.714
Did the cleaner get any more texts?

28:38.716 --> 28:43.152
No, just the 7:00 a.m.
appointment at 95th and 5th.

28:43.154 --> 28:45.321
Did you get him to confirm that
the meet is with Bianchi?

28:45.323 --> 28:49.125
No. He's a very tough guy.

28:49.127 --> 28:52.528
But it's either Bianchi or someone

28:52.530 --> 28:54.330
high up on the food chain.

28:54.332 --> 28:57.133
Harlee, when I find Bianchi...

28:59.037 --> 29:00.806
You know where this is headed.

29:02.373 --> 29:04.473
If you're not up for the ride,

29:05.060 --> 29:07.476
it's best to get out now.

29:07.478 --> 29:09.478
There are other ways to get there.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.881
He shot my son.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.292
Another inch...

29:13.294 --> 29:15.278
The cleaner's not going anywhere.

29:16.654 --> 29:18.387
Go to the hospital. See your boy.

29:18.389 --> 29:19.889
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.058
We'll get who he's meeting with.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.673
<i>You engaged in unsanctioned contact</i>

29:36.675 --> 29:39.075
<i>with the daughter of a former asset.</i>

29:39.077 --> 29:41.344
<i>A minor, Agent Stahl.</i>

29:41.346 --> 29:43.546
<i>The evidence before me
points to a flagrant</i>

29:43.548 --> 29:45.348
<i>and disturbing abuse of power.</i>

29:45.976 --> 29:47.984
<i>And a total violation of the very values</i>

29:47.986 --> 29:49.352
<i>you swore to uphold.</i>

29:49.354 --> 29:53.022
Gail, you're his supervisor.

29:53.024 --> 29:55.443
You have anything to say on his behalf?

29:56.428 --> 29:59.662
No. I don't.

30:01.449 --> 30:03.034
Sir...

30:04.494 --> 30:08.171
I have sacrificed everything.

30:08.173 --> 30:11.294
My marriage, my health,

30:12.352 --> 30:14.421
to serve this bureau.

30:17.841 --> 30:19.415
It is all that I have.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.252
Please don't take it away.

30:22.762 --> 30:25.056
<i>I recommend an indefinite suspension.</i>

30:26.099 --> 30:27.696
<i>Effective immediately.</i>

30:42.298 --> 30:44.374
Robert.

30:45.869 --> 30:47.443
Your badge.

31:21.738 --> 31:23.577
No! No! No!

31:23.579 --> 31:24.848
No!

31:38.396 --> 31:41.297
Mom, you're inhibiting
my range of motion right now.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.332
I'm sorry!

31:43.334 --> 31:44.967
This is nice, isn't it?

31:44.969 --> 31:47.103
Yeah, I mean, you're making it
kind of weird.

31:47.105 --> 31:49.038
Am I making it weird?

31:49.040 --> 31:50.040
Little bit.

31:51.810 --> 31:52.909
Okay.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.805
Cristina, your mom tells me
you play the cello.

31:55.807 --> 31:58.755
Of course she did.
I think she opens with that.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.299
What? I'm proud.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.935
Hey, if I'm not here to chaperone,

32:02.937 --> 32:03.936
will you two behave?

32:03.938 --> 32:05.298
What? You going to bed already?

32:05.345 --> 32:07.139
Yeah, I didn't get
much sleep last night.

32:07.141 --> 32:10.203
Thank you for letting me crash
your family dinner.

32:10.812 --> 32:12.945
Yeah, you're the reason
we're having family dinner.

32:12.947 --> 32:14.547
I mean, we usually eat by the TV.

32:14.549 --> 32:16.415
- Love you.
- Love you too.

32:16.417 --> 32:18.795
Bye. Bye.

32:50.285 --> 32:52.151
I thought I'd lost you, Nate.

32:54.922 --> 32:58.491
I didn't push you away

32:59.377 --> 33:01.963
because you were gay.

33:03.214 --> 33:04.663
I didn't.

33:07.944 --> 33:12.471
You asked me if I experimented.

33:15.539 --> 33:19.378
And yeah, I did.

33:21.925 --> 33:24.383
But I love your mother.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.363
And I love you.

33:29.348 --> 33:32.291
And I will pay any price

33:33.536 --> 33:35.669
to make things right again.

33:37.710 --> 33:39.323
The truth is,

33:39.325 --> 33:42.086
I'm more proud of you

33:43.004 --> 33:45.731
than anything that I've ever done.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.442
Did you hear that?

34:30.927 --> 34:32.592
No, I was a little distracted.

34:36.498 --> 34:38.966
Cristina?

34:38.967 --> 34:40.895
Should I go?

34:41.837 --> 34:45.320
You leave a woman's bed
the day you say the L word,

34:45.375 --> 34:47.110
she might think you didn't mean it.

34:49.346 --> 34:51.913
Then I guess I'm not going anywhere.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.795
95th and 5th. It's 7:03.
I don't see him.

36:04.797 --> 36:08.031
<i>Let's wait five more minutes
for Bianchi.</i>

36:10.502 --> 36:12.736
<i>Wait. At 3:00. I know her.</i>

36:12.738 --> 36:14.504
<i>That's Bianchi's girl.</i>

36:14.506 --> 36:16.139
Got her.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.449
Meeting someone? Keep walking.

36:25.451 --> 36:27.851
I'll direct you.
Let's head up to your place.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.352
I could scream.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.420
Not if he pulls the trigger first.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.789
Are you that certain that I came alone?

36:32.791 --> 36:34.558
You only looked straight ahead

36:34.560 --> 36:35.852
when he put the gun in your back.

36:35.876 --> 36:37.627
I don't think anybody's
coming to your rescue.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.697
Harlee, this is Elena.
Bianchi's side piece.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.977
Seems like she lied to me
last time we spoke.

36:44.369 --> 36:47.105
I have a feeling she won't be
making that mistake again.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.340
"All balls and no brains."

36:50.342 --> 36:52.876
Isn't that what you said about me?

36:52.878 --> 36:55.679
Well, now I get to return
the compliment.

36:55.681 --> 36:58.241
Not many people have what it takes

36:58.884 --> 37:02.719
to lie while sucking the
business end of a loaded gun.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.554
I'm telling you the truth.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.490
Bianchi was in Italy.

37:06.492 --> 37:07.991
Key to survival:

37:07.993 --> 37:11.838
Tell your captors something
but not everything.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.831
I don't understand.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.600
While Bianchi was hunkered down,

37:16.602 --> 37:18.094
you were his go-between.

37:18.604 --> 37:21.071
He gave the orders.
You called the shots.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.073
He doesn't tell me anything.
Look at me, I'm just...

37:23.075 --> 37:24.641
I'm one thing to him.

37:24.643 --> 37:27.077
Make 'em think
you're just a pretty girl?

37:27.079 --> 37:29.079
I know that trick too.

37:29.081 --> 37:32.582
Then you know I would do
anything to survive.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.417
Like shoot at a house full of cops?

37:34.419 --> 37:36.086
That little party that
you threw the other night

37:36.088 --> 37:37.821
sent his son into surgery.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.824
He survived.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.025
Then stop while you're ahead.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.594
We know Bianchi's in the country.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.563
So what we're gonna do

37:46.565 --> 37:50.084
is we're gonna play a fun little game

37:50.769 --> 37:54.771
called "The truth will set you free."

37:54.773 --> 37:58.008
Harlee, why don't you take
the dog for a walk?

37:58.010 --> 38:00.076
Violence upsets him.

38:09.855 --> 38:14.024
The only guarantee is that I win.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.778
One bullet.

38:18.897 --> 38:21.164
Five empty chambers.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.302
Where's Bianchi?

38:25.304 --> 38:27.971
You just told us. The United States.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.472
Narrow it down.

38:29.474 --> 38:30.974
Of America.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.309
You know what?

38:32.311 --> 38:34.177
You got neighbors.

38:34.179 --> 38:37.048
We don't want them in
on our little game.

38:38.217 --> 38:40.051
Do we?

38:41.720 --> 38:43.172
Yeah.

38:43.174 --> 38:44.847
Got to keep it quiet.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.823
Our little secret.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.959
Thank you, Harlee.

38:48.961 --> 38:50.660
Where is he?

38:55.901 --> 38:58.602
You're a good solider,
I'll give you that.

38:58.604 --> 39:00.488
How's your pain tolerance?

39:06.078 --> 39:07.677
You're next, sweetheart.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.980
Tell him where Bianchi is,
and I'll protect you.

39:09.982 --> 39:11.709
Here you go. Spinning it around.

39:11.711 --> 39:13.450
I didn't know he was in the country!

39:13.452 --> 39:15.118
No, I swear!

39:15.120 --> 39:17.687
- Convince me!
- No! Please! Please!

39:17.689 --> 39:20.624
This performance is sounding
awfully familiar.

39:20.626 --> 39:23.460
Please! Please! Please!

39:23.462 --> 39:24.861
Please!

39:26.131 --> 39:28.198
I'm not spinning the cylinder,

39:28.200 --> 39:30.934
so your odds go down drastically.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.702
One in five to one in four?

39:32.704 --> 39:34.271
I still like my chances.

39:34.273 --> 39:36.274
I'll play with you.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.945
Everybody's got a bullet
waiting for them.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.881
I have a feeling yours is awfully close.

39:44.883 --> 39:45.749
- No!
- Where is he?

39:45.751 --> 39:46.983
Too bad I don't have a son

39:46.985 --> 39:48.285
to step in front of it for me.

39:49.288 --> 39:51.821
Woz!

39:56.561 --> 39:57.894
All right.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.663
- Your turn.
- No...

39:59.665 --> 40:02.832
One bullet, five empty cylinders.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.134
No... no...

40:04.136 --> 40:06.603
- Woz...
- Where's Bianchi?

40:06.605 --> 40:08.571
All right! All right, I'll tell you.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.173
I'll tell you, but it won't
matter, 'cause he's gonna be

40:10.175 --> 40:11.508
out of jail in one day,
and he won't stop

40:11.510 --> 40:13.576
until all of us are dead.

40:13.578 --> 40:14.911
We'll make sure he doesn't walk.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.079
We'll make sure of that.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.914
You can't keep that promise.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.593
He's got dirt on everybody who's
anybody in New York.

40:20.595 --> 40:22.686
He could bring this whole city
to its knees if he wants to.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.521
He's untouchable. What kind of dirt?

40:24.523 --> 40:27.257
He's got bank records. He's got photos.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.259
He's got recordings on senators,

40:29.261 --> 40:31.628
on judges, on you.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.263
Where does he keep this dirt?

40:33.265 --> 40:34.764
Is it with him?

40:34.766 --> 40:37.934
Lawyer's office. Wall Street. All right?

40:37.936 --> 40:40.937
There is a box locked up there
with instructions

40:40.939 --> 40:44.941
to open and disseminate if
anything happens to him.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.176
Dead man's switch.

40:46.178 --> 40:47.577
That's one way of putting it.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.012
Where are the copies?

40:49.014 --> 40:50.046
There aren't any.

40:50.431 --> 40:53.116
Defeats the purpose of locking it away.

40:53.118 --> 40:56.386
We get the box, then we'll get him.

40:56.388 --> 40:59.055
He's in a safe house. Uptown.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.091
That's where you'll find him.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.699
Write down the address.
