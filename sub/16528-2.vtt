00:07.375 --> 00:08.140
         Hi. I'm Maurice.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.976
     I'm an executive by day
     and a wild man by night.

00:10.978 --> 00:13.212
       I'm not afraid
       to get sand on my tuxedo

00:13.214 --> 00:14.747
         if you're not afraid
         to let the wind

00:21.856 --> 00:24.623
 How would you like to meet
 the man of your dreams?

00:24.625 --> 00:25.958
        Ew.
             You're really old.

00:25.960 --> 00:26.692
       Ouch. (CHUCKLES)

00:26.694 --> 00:30.929

     video dating.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.832
       It's a real business.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.502
        Using our advanced
        VHS technology

00:36.504 --> 00:38.971

00:38.973 --> 00:42.041

 monthly fees of only $19.99,

00:42.043 --> 00:44.276

 because for a limited time,

  the VD community

01:02.430 --> 01:04.263
        gets a free tote bag
        for just $12.99.

01:04.265 --> 01:08.400
 I am not carrying around a bag

   video dating?
   I'm living the dream.

 It's 2:00 in the afternoon,
 and you're still in your robe.

01:20.347 --> 01:23.916
 So? A robe is just
 a long jacket made of towel.

01:23.918 --> 01:24.983
 Lots of people wear these.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.051
   Not to other people's homes.

     Did somebody say "set up"?

 No, stop.
 We don't need your help.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.240
 Sorry, but, uh,
 your way of matchmaking
 is a thing of the past.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.943
     (NORMAL VOICE) Please.
     I am literally responsible

01:50.945 --> 01:53.345

              over 200 couples,

01:53.347 --> 01:55.380
     which means
     I'm personally responsible

01:55.382 --> 01:56.815
        for over 62,000 babies.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.217
 Yeah,
 that's not real math.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.718
         Bill, would you rather
         put your heart

01:59.720 --> 02:01.553
      in the hands
      of a proven love champion

02:01.555 --> 02:05.591
    or risk everything
    with someone whose romantic
    record is a little spotty?

02:05.593 --> 02:07.392
      Honestly,
      I'd rather not do either.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.094
 Hey,
 my record is not spotty.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.497

 the best ever at love.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.131
 Yeah, not so much.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.399
 And when you think about it,
 you've only had one boyfriend,

02:14.401 --> 02:15.400
 and that was
 two years ago.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.736
         Right, Dante.
         What a character.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.138
         His name wasn't Dante.

02:19.140 --> 02:19.938
      He had that small hand.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.575
       Who are you thinking of?
       And I'm alone by choice.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.042
    Ha! Please.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.912
 You only liked Geoff
 after he wanted nothing
 to do with you.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.548

            Well, I'll show you

      how friggin' great
      I am at friggin' love

02:31.285 --> 02:33.085
   when your dad's walking down
   the friggin' aisle.

02:33.087 --> 02:37.022
       See, you don't even know
       that men don't walk down
       the aisle!

       Gah! Bill, get out

           Okay.

   I'm gonna need a warm towel.

 Oh, it's traveling!
 It's moving south! Aah!

          or land pirate.

 to be a librarian!

03:30.411 --> 03:33.579
 Bookkeeper's not a librarian,
 you moron.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.780
 It's more like
 an accountant.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.182
    Why didn't I get an awesome
    job like boat owner

03:37.184 --> 03:39.017
        or rap mogul
        or neighborhood oracle?

        so you can suck it.

 no better place to find love

                who's laughing

06:38.699 --> 06:41.166
           after you do
           3,000 squat thrusts.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.768
   No, I'm serious.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.569
 I want to teach gym, sir.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.073
        My God.
        It's finally happening.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.341
         I'm gonna be a mentor.

06:49.343 --> 06:52.144
      Are you crying?
  My eyes are just celebrating.

06:52.146 --> 06:54.513
               Here. Take this.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.081
           Training begins now!

06:56.083 --> 06:56.748
           (AIR BLOWS)

06:56.750 --> 06:59.317
  Damn it, I broke it!
  Why do I have
  such powerful lungs?

06:59.319 --> 07:00.886
       No,
       it's a training whistle.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.688
           You'll get the tiny,
           little ball that
           makes it work

07:03.690 --> 07:05.891
             when you're ready.
      When will that be?

07:05.893 --> 07:06.925
              Coach will know.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.729
     Now let the physical
     education education begin.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.799
       First up, drink this mix
       of celery and cod.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.634
               Glug hard, boy.
               Glug hard.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.470
    ADULT ADAM:
    <i> While Barry hit a home run</i>
    <i> with his new career,</i>

07:18.472 --> 07:20.739
 <i> Erica was striking out</i>
 <i> at matchmaking.</i>

07:20.741 --> 07:23.141
              Swing and a miss.
              Bill struck out.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.510
              Not one response
              to his video.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.211
 How is that possible?

07:26.213 --> 07:28.580
      Honestly, I've never seen
      such a negative reaction,

07:28.582 --> 07:31.650
         and a lot of my
         clients are just me in
         different costumes.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.885
 There has to be someone
 for Bill.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.288
  This thing
  guarantees a match.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.858
        No, it says
        it "Gurantees a match."

07:39.860 --> 07:40.959
    And that's not a real word,

07:40.961 --> 07:42.627
          so it's not a legally
          binding contract.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.763
  Don't make me leave
  empty-handed.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.299
 Please,
 I need to find someone.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.900
  Erica?

07:49.403 --> 07:50.802
        Oh, hi, guys.
        What you doing?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.438
 Geoff put some charm jewelry
 on layaway.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.673
 What are you doing?

07:54.675 --> 07:55.740
       Are you video-dating?

07:55.742 --> 07:56.641
                  What?
                  No, no, no.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.678
   I'm only here to help set up
   my best friend's dad.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.979
      I know
      when I say that out loud,

08:00.981 --> 08:03.682
        it doesn't sound great
        or real, but it's both.

08:03.684 --> 08:08.453
 Well, best of luck
 with whatever this is.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.656
                (JOHN SIGHS)

08:11.658 --> 08:13.859
      Gross.
                  Young love.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.962
 Look, I need
 to find Bill someone.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.630
 It's how I'm gonna prove
 that I'm good at this.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.266
       With the tape Bill made?
       Not a chance.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.034
 Well, then I'll make
 a better one.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.303
 And I've got
 just the person to help.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.139
 Nerd, I need you
 to make an awesome video
 for Lainey's dad.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.509
          Holy balls!
          My first professional
          paid gig!

08:30.511 --> 08:33.445
 I'm not paying you.
      Still a professional gig,
      though.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.547
 It's really not.
                  I see it now.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.847
       We open on a time portal

08:36.850 --> 08:40.519
            as Mr. Lewis' cold,
            naked body spills
            to the Earth.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.288
        He rises from the smoke
        like a Love Terminator.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.156
    Yeah, no nudity
    or time travel.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.193
    Just make Mr. Lewis
    look cool, you know, macho.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.596
     We're making a picture!
     An Adam F. Goldberg joint.

08:51.598 --> 08:52.297
 What's with the "F"?

08:52.299 --> 08:54.599
       There's another
       Adam Goldberg at school.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.433
          He's super-sensitive.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.302
     I don't want to cause
     any marketplace confusion.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.004
 Don't worry about it.
 No one cares about
 either of you.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.941
   ADULT ADAM:
   <i> But I wasn't the only one</i>
   <i> landing a gig</i>

09:02.943 --> 09:04.776
  <i> in my chosen profession.</i>

09:04.778 --> 09:05.510
 (AIR BLOWS)

09:05.512 --> 09:08.480
              That looks broke.
              Let me fix that.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.516
 Hey, I was practicing
 my tooting skills.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.351
 Coach said
 the whistle is the foundation

09:13.353 --> 09:15.153
 from which the gymnasium arts
 were built.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.721
     You're just gonna sit here
     and let him do this.

09:16.723 --> 09:20.258
    It was nice and quiet.
    He said it was for school.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.026
        It is!

09:21.028 --> 09:23.328
 I've finally decided
 on a career path.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.830
  I'm gonna be
  a P.E. teacher.

09:25.832 --> 09:26.364
          Oh, my.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.800
  Dad, you're right.
  It's time I find my
  place in society.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.870
 And what could impact society
 more than me teaching youth

09:31.872 --> 09:34.906
 how to do light exercise
 and parachute games?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.909
      I fully support you 100%.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.643
   Seriously? Dude!

09:38.645 --> 09:41.146
 I thought you were gonna
 stomp on this dream
 like all the others.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.614
            Nah, it's too good.
           It is.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.649
 In fact, I'm gonna go
 grab some shut-eye.

09:44.651 --> 09:45.283
                   It's 6:30.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.320
 I'm waking up at dawn.
 Me and Coach are going
 on a 12-mile jog,

09:48.322 --> 09:50.422
 then we're powering down
 a classic English breakfast.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.757
                   Why?
   He likes to start
   each morning

09:52.759 --> 09:54.259
  with 5,000
  to 6,000 calories,

09:54.261 --> 09:55.994
 bangers and mash,
 kippers, kidneys,

09:55.996 --> 09:58.897
 boiled and fried potatoes,
 black and white pudding,

09:58.899 --> 10:01.466
 three kinds of meats.
 His mom's British.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.200
         Seems like a lot.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.469
 She's a handful,
 but I like her. (CHUCKLES)

10:04.471 --> 10:06.071
 Anyway, off to bed.

10:06.073 --> 10:06.905
 I don't understand, Mur.

10:06.907 --> 10:11.242
 Are you actually okay
 with your son being
 a gym coach?

10:11.244 --> 10:12.010
     Just like everything else,

10:12.012 --> 10:14.713
           the kid will move on
           to the next stupid
           dream of his.

10:14.715 --> 10:15.714
 And what if he doesn't?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.082
            Believe me,
            he ain't getting up

10:17.084 --> 10:20.585
         at 5:00 in the morning
         to move his body.
         We're golden.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.288
            Dig deep.
            Imagine a jaguar's
            chasing you.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.022
 Let's go.

10:24.024 --> 10:27.425
 I'm miserable, but happier
 than I've ever been.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.327
            Oh! (BLEEP)

10:31.498 --> 10:35.834
 ADULT ADAM:
 <i> It was the day of the big</i>
 <i> premiere of a dating video.</i>

10:35.836 --> 10:37.636
 <i> But, hey,</i>
 <i> it was still a premiere.</i>

10:37.638 --> 10:40.338
 Before I begin,
 I have a few words to say.

10:40.340 --> 10:44.209
 Webster's Dictionary
 defines "masterpiece" as...

10:44.211 --> 10:45.243
                  Press "play."

10:45.245 --> 10:46.277
      Okay,
      without further ado,

10:46.279 --> 10:53.284
   I present to you Bill Lewis,
   as requested,
   a real macho man.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.756
           <i> � Hey, hey</i>

10:57.758 --> 10:59.257
        <i> � Hey, hey, hey</i>

10:59.259 --> 11:01.359
       <i> � Macho, macho man</i>

11:01.361 --> 11:03.194
        <i> � Macho man, yeah</i>

11:03.196 --> 11:05.530
 <i> � I've got to be a macho man</i>

11:05.532 --> 11:10.502
     <i> � I've got to be a macho,</i>
     <i> macho, macho man</i>

11:10.504 --> 11:11.836
    <i> � I've got to be a macho</i>

11:11.838 --> 11:12.671
           <i> Hi. I'm Bill Lewis.</i>

11:12.673 --> 11:14.906
    <i> And I like to dance, get</i>
    <i> sweaty, and have some fun.</i>

11:14.908 --> 11:17.175
           <i> I'm ship shape</i>
           <i> and ready for love.</i>

11:17.177 --> 11:19.044
   <i> Hey,</i>
   <i> let's build a relationship.</i>

11:19.046 --> 11:20.912
      <i> � I've got to be</i>
      <i> a macho, macho, macho �</i>

11:20.914 --> 11:22.514
        <i> You have the right</i>
        <i> to fall in love</i>

11:22.516 --> 11:26.718
 <i> with Bill Lewis of</i>
 <i> Bill Lewis Tile and Flooring.</i>

11:26.720 --> 11:27.686
 Hey, what are you doing?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.287
             Destroying this
             and starting over.

11:29.289 --> 11:33.324
 But I gave you exactly what
 you asked for, macho.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.060
     Your dad was
     a shirtless cowboy,

11:35.062 --> 11:38.196
    a sweaty cop,
    a leather-clad biker.

11:38.198 --> 11:38.763
        Oh, I see it now.

11:38.765 --> 11:41.366
       Erica, it's time
       to hand me the reins.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.568
              This is the job
              for the Yentadex.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.636
         What the hell is that?

11:44.638 --> 11:46.237
     Every yenta has a Rolodex

11:46.239 --> 11:49.274
    filled with perfect matches
    for everyone they know.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.709
  So buckle up, Bill.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.477
 You're about to go on
 the ride of your life.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.313
 No, there will be no buckling.
 I'm handling this.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.149
        Okay, I appreciate
        everyone's help,

11:58.151 --> 12:00.418
        but I'm shutting
        this down. I'm just...

12:00.420 --> 12:02.620
          I'm not over my wife.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.390
      We all get one true love,
      and she was mine.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.959
 There is no way you only get
 one soul mate in life

12:07.961 --> 12:09.728
   because he's in love
   with someone else,

12:09.730 --> 12:11.196
 and then I'm gonna
 be alone forever,

12:11.198 --> 12:14.132
 and I'm not gonna let that
 happen to you, Bill!

12:14.534 --> 12:18.002
         Wow. She's a
         passionate young lady.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.170
            Got most
            of her facts wrong,

12:19.172 --> 12:21.573
            but her heart's
            in the right place.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.142
       Hey, guys,
       I really need your help.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.010
               Each of you grab
               a leg and push.

12:26.012 --> 12:29.714
      I ate nine bananas,
      but I'm still cramping up
      something nasty.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.616
 Damn it,
 you ate all my bananas?

12:31.618 --> 12:33.685
    I'm in real athletic pain!

12:33.687 --> 12:34.152
 Sit, Al.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.255
  Nobody is touching those legs
  in those tiny shorts.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.091
             These are official
             coaching bottoms.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.826
         Sure, they cinch up
         the bathing-suit area,

12:41.828 --> 12:43.695
          but Coach says
          I'll eventually reach

12:43.697 --> 12:45.263
        a healthy level
        of crotchular numbness.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.866
           For the love of God,
           take 'em off!

12:47.868 --> 12:49.000
       You'll never have kids.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.169
               Gym teachers
               don't have kids.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.105
       Their kids are
       the students they teach.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.874
 All right,
 enough with this gym crap.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.710
  Sit down.
 <i> Clash of the Titans</i> is on.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.678
 They've got oracles.
 You love oracles.

13:00.680 --> 13:04.449
         Eh, seers and wizards
         don't fit into my new,
         healthy lifestyle.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.984
          I'm gonna go blend up
          a power shake.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.754
             So much fiber.
             The body really is
             an amazing organ.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.823
         One point, two points,
         three points.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.025
            (CHUCKLES)
            Four points, Barry.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.127

20:46.713 --> 20:49.146
  Well, I guess all this dating
  talk got me thinking

20:49.148 --> 20:50.948
     maybe I am ready
     to give love another shot.

20:50.950 --> 20:54.218
 Well, unfortunately,
 Mom's not here, and she
 hides her Yentadex.

20:54.220 --> 20:57.355
 But perhaps I can help.
 Come, my child.

20:57.357 --> 21:00.124
             I see a beautiful,
             bubbly blonde.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.393
               She loves shorts
               and the beach.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.362
 Oh, yeah,
 I like where this is going.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.463
          And she has a friend.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.932
 There's two girls?
        Yes, three is company.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.033
     Hot damn.
     When do I get to meet 'em?

21:09.035 --> 21:11.602
          All you got to do is
          knock on their door.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.170
  I do?
  They've been waiting for you.

21:13.172 --> 21:16.040
 It's <i> Three's Company,</i> Bill.
 It's a popular TV show.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.343
 He forgets what he watches,
 and he thinks it's the future.

21:19.345 --> 21:20.011
        All right! Forget that!

21:20.013 --> 21:22.280
           Let me clear my mind
           and start over.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.748
         I see you and a woman.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.551
        One of you is the boss.
        But who is the boss?

21:27.553 --> 21:28.619
         (GLASS BREAKS)

21:28.621 --> 21:30.955
               I actually
               saw that coming.
