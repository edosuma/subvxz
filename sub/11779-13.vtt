{\an8}- WELL, THANKS, LIZ.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.034
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I WAS A WILD CARD
IN THIS COMPETITION,

04:45.118 --> 04:46.369
{\an8}AND I HAD TO FIGHT SO HARD
TO GET HERE,

04:46.452 --> 04:47.870
I REALLY KNOW I DESERVE
TO STAND UP HERE

04:47.954 --> 04:50.665

{\an8}HER WORDS, NOT MINE.

05:11.602 --> 05:12.937
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS, BUDDY?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.064
{\an8}- YEAH, THIS ENTIRE SEASON,

05:15.148 --> 05:16.858
{\an8}SCOTT HAS HAD A TARGET
ON MY BACK.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.652
{\an8}HE'S GIVEN ME SKULLS TO TRY TO
GET ME OUT OF THIS COMPETITION,

05:19.736 --> 05:22.447
BUT THAT BACKFIRED
BECAUSE IT REALLY BROUGHT ME

05:22.530 --> 05:25.450
TO A NEW LEVEL AND IT BROUGHT ME
TO MY "A" GAME.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.952
IF SCOTT AND MATTI
HAD THE SAME CANVASES

05:28.036 --> 05:29.370
THAT I HAD TO DEAL WITH,

05:29.454 --> 05:31.581
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'D BE
HERE TONIGHT BY MY SIDE.

05:31.664 --> 05:35.168
BUT IF I WIN THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER TONIGHT,

05:35.251 --> 05:37.712
I KNOW THAT THAT'S
THE BEST REVENGE.

05:37.795 --> 05:42.508
- ALL RIGHT.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.427
LET ME, UH...

05:44.510 --> 05:45.762
LET ME THROW IT TO OLIVER
FOR A SECOND.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.930
OLIVER, DO YOU THINK THAT
SAUSAGE HAD TO WORK HARDER

05:48.014 --> 05:50.183
THAN MATTI TO GET HERE?

05:50.266 --> 05:51.768
{\an8}- I THINK EVERYBODY
HAD TO WORK HARD

05:51.851 --> 05:52.769
{\an8}TO MAKE IT TO THIS POINT.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.353
{\an8}EVERYBODY DID GREAT TATTOOS.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.772
EVERYBODY HAD HARD CHALLENGES.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.107
AND THAT'S A PART
OF THIS COMPETITION.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.234
IT'S NOT ABOUT
GETTING THE EASY ROAD.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.611
IT'S ABOUT DOING
WHAT YOU GOT TO DO,

06:01.694 --> 06:03.821
DOING THE GOOD TATTOOS,
STAYING RIGHT THERE.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.031
- RIGHT ON, MAN.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.200
SCOTT, LET ME ASK YOU.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.202
A LOT OF THE FANS WOULD ASK--

06:09.285 --> 06:11.621
THAT YOU TARGETING SAUSAGE
WAS UNFAIR.

06:11.704 --> 06:12.663
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?

06:12.747 --> 06:14.540
- I DON'T THINK IT WAS UNFAIR.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.958
HE WAS MY COMPETITION,

06:16.042 --> 06:19.170
{\an8}AND I EARNED SKULLS PICKS
BY WINNING FLASH CHALLENGES.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.672
{\an8}I DIDN'T RESPECT SAUSAGE
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T RESPECT ME.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.632
- [whistles]

06:22.715 --> 06:24.634
- EVERY TIME I WON A CHALLENGE,

06:24.717 --> 06:26.385
HE WOULD WHINE AND CRY
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE WON

06:26.469 --> 06:27.970
OR SOMEBODY ELSE
SHOULD HAVE WON.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.473
BUT WHEN I WON--WHEN HE WON,
I WOULD CONGRATULATE HIM

06:30.556 --> 06:31.724
AND SHAKE HIS HAND.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.769
SO WHEN IT CAME TIME
TO DO THE SKULL PICKS,

06:34.852 --> 06:36.312
I GAVE HIM THE HARD ONES.

06:36.395 --> 06:40.149
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S READ
A TWEET FROM ALANA.

06:40.233 --> 06:44.320
{\an8}ALANA SAYS SCOTT DOES NOT
DESERVE TO WIN INK MASTER.

06:44.403 --> 06:47.824
{\an8}HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO EVEN BE
IN THE TOP THREE.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.992

DEFINITELY.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.494

{\an8}CHRIS, HOW DO YOU RESPOND?

06:55.414 --> 06:57.834
{\an8}- WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT
THE WAY THIS IS SET UP,

06:57.917 --> 07:00.211
{\an8}IT IS A GAME, AND IT'S INTENDED
TO PUSH YOU.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.838

{\an8}WE'RE TATTOOING, WHICH IS WHERE
OUR HEARTS ARE, FOR YOU GUYS,

07:04.757 --> 07:06.342
{\an8}BUT WE'RE ALSO ENTERTAINING.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.344
AND THIS IS A GAME THAT'S DRIVEN
TO PUSH EVERYBODY'S BUTTONS.

07:08.427 --> 07:11.347

SOMETIMES PANS OUT.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.142

KIND OF MASTERFUL.

SO IF YOU CAN TATTOO
AND YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME,

YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.313

07:25.570 --> 07:27.989
- YEAH, MY PROBLEM
WAS NEVER WITH THE JUDGING.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.241
MY PROBLEM
HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH SCOTT.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.952
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE EVERY
SINGLE TIME HE WON A CHALLENGE,

07:33.035 --> 07:35.913
HE WOULD JUST GO UP TO THE LOFT
AND HE WOULD JUST BOAST AROUND

07:35.997 --> 07:38.457
JUST LIKE A PROUD PEACOCK
AND, YOU KNOW,

07:38.541 --> 07:40.376
"LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME.
I WON," YOU KNOW?

07:40.459 --> 07:41.544

07:41.627 --> 07:44.797
UNDERNEATH YOUR COVERS
EVERY TIME YOU LOST.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.758
AND I'D RATHER BE
THE COCKY ARTIST

07:47.842 --> 07:50.261
THAN THE WHINY CRYBABY.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.180
- BUT YOU KNOW--
- GUYS?

07:52.263 --> 07:53.639

YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:53.723 --> 07:56.851
YOU ARE COCKY,
AND YOU'RE A BULLY.

07:56.934 --> 07:57.894
BECAUSE I GET,
DURING THIS COMPETITION--

I APOLOGIZE.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.733

BUT BELIEVE ME,

08:27.757 --> 08:30.468
{\an8}- WINNING <i> INK MASTER</i> WOULD
CHANGE MY LIFE.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.596
{\an8}I NEED THIS MORE THAN ANYBODY.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.349
{\an8}- I'VE REALLY HAD TO FIGHT
TOOTH AND NAIL

08:36.432 --> 08:37.850
{\an8}TO GET WHERE I'M AT.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.559
{\an8}THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL
THAT I'M GOING TO GIVE SCOTT

08:39.644 --> 08:40.937
{\an8}THE SATISFACTION
OF TAKING AWAY MY TITLE

08:41.020 --> 08:41.938
{\an8}OF INK MASTER.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.940
HEY.

08:44.023 --> 08:44.690
- HELLO.
- FANCY MEETING YOU HERE.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.150
- HI.
- HOW YOU DOING?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.235
EVERYBODY'S DOING BACK PIECES.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.361
THIS IS KIND OF TO SHOW YOU

08:48.444 --> 08:50.029
THE DARKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE
IN THERE.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.323
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO SECURE THIS WIN.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.077
- WE ARE GOING TO DO THE HEART
REALLY ANATOMIC,

08:56.160 --> 08:58.454
LIKE IT'S BLOODY AND SHINY
AND RED.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.373
THIS TATTOO
SCREAMS SCOTT MARSHALL.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.208
IT'S GONNA BE THE BOLDEST TATTOO
THAT THE JUDGES HAVE EVER SEEN.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.627
YOU READY?
- YEP.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.921
- WE'VE GOT THE CENTER
OF YOUR SPINE,

09:07.004 --> 09:08.506
GOT MOST OF THE WEIGHT
ON THIS SIDE,

09:08.589 --> 09:09.924
AND HAVE THE FEATHERY STUFF
OVER HERE TO BALANCE IT OUT.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.635
I'M GOING UP AGAINST
TWO REALLY STRONG ARTISTS,

09:12.718 --> 09:14.387
BUT I'VE COME OUT
SWINGING HARD.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.972
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING
TO BLOW THIS.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.974
I'VE BEATEN THESE GUYS
IN CHALLENGES BEFORE.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.976
SO IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ME.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.310
- I TEND TO THINK THAT MATTI

09:21.394 --> 09:23.312
IS MORE OF A BIGGER THREAT TO ME
THAN SCOTT IS.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.356
HE REALLY HAS NOTHING TO LOSE.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.277
- BUT SCOTT MIGHT BE HAVING
SOME PROBLEMS TOO

09:29.360 --> 09:31.570
BECAUSE HE'S REALLY
HEAVY-HANDED.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.823
- OH!

09:33.906 --> 09:35.157
OH, MY GOD.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.034
- YOU GOT TO EARN IT TOO,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

09:37.118 --> 09:38.369
THIS IS WHAT
YOU SIGNED UP FOR.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.539
THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE
TO WIN THIS COMPETITION.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.500
- OH! DUDE, I'M [bleep] DONE.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.876
- FINISH LINE
IS, LIKE, RIGHT THERE.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.003
YOU CAN SEE IT.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.797
SHE HAS TO BE DOWN
FOR ALL 35 HOURS.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.925
- I LOVED TATTOOS
UNTIL I GOT THIS ONE.

09:58.306 --> 09:58.806
- ALMOST THERE,
ALMOST THERE.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.352
[alarm beeping]
- [shudders]

10:03.436 --> 10:04.186
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE DONE.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.646
- FINALLY ALL DONE.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.274
SCOTT AND SAUSAGE SHOULD BE
[bleep] NERVOUS.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.275
- THAT'S AMAZING, MAN.

10:09.358 --> 10:12.611
- I PUT ON A BADASS
$100,000 TATTOO.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.113
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE DID.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.573
[bleep] GONNA BE
A TOUGH CALL.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.533
- GOOD GOD.
IT LOOKS AWESOME.

10:17.616 --> 10:20.036
NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE
THAT TITLE AWAY FROM ME.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.789
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.374
- THIS TATTOO IS GOING TO GIVE
ME THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.709
- AMAZING.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.086
- THE GOOD GUY ALWAYS WINS.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.006
[cheers and applause]

10:34.300 --> 10:36.510
- ALL RIGHT, IN JUST A MOMENT,

10:36.594 --> 10:38.888
WE ARE GOING TO REVEAL
THE FINAL TATTOOS.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.765
THE RACE BETWEEN THESE
THREE ARTISTS

10:40.848 --> 10:43.392
HAS BEEN ONE OF THE TIGHTEST
IN <i> INK MASTER</i> HISTORY.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.103

10:59.200 --> 11:00.910

11:39.448 --> 11:42.535
[cheers and applause]

11:53.879 --> 11:56.090
ALL RIGHT, SAUSAGE, YOU'RE UP.
LET'S SEE YOUR TATTOO.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.300
AND WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
ABOUT IT?

11:58.384 --> 11:59.135

12:13.899 --> 12:16.527

OF THIS COMPETITION,

12:16.610 --> 12:19.530
WE MAY NEED A FULL 360
OF YOUR--NO?

12:19.613 --> 12:22.074
ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD, BUDDY.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.994
- WHAT I TATTOOED ON MY MASTER
CANVAS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

12:25.077 --> 12:27.496
THAT'S VERY ALLURING,
BUT IF YOU LOOK CLOSER,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.457
SHE'S GOT A DARK SIDE.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.917
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT MYSELF
AS BEING A TATTOO ARTIST

12:32.001 --> 12:34.920
IS THAT I REALLY COMMUNICATE
WITH MY CANVASES,

12:35.004 --> 12:38.716
AND SO THIS IS
A TRUE COLLABORATION BETWEEN US.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.177
- THANKS, BUDDY.
NICE JOB.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.471
MATTI, YOU'RE UP NEXT.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.352
MATTI, TELL US ABOUT YOUR PIECE.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.771
- WELL, MAN,
THIS IS SO HUGE FOR ME.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.232
BUT THIS IS MY TATTOO, AND...

12:55.316 --> 12:58.152
[cheers and applause]

13:02.490 --> 13:05.618
FOR ME, THIS IS MY
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT I FEEL--

13:05.701 --> 13:08.746
THE STRUGGLE THAT ALL OF US
HAVE GOING THROUGH--

13:08.829 --> 13:10.998
A DAILY BASIS, YOU KNOW.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.125
I TRIED TO USE A WHOLE LOT
OF SYMBOLISM, YOU KNOW,

13:13.209 --> 13:14.251
TO DEPICT AN ANGEL

13:14.335 --> 13:16.045
RISING FROM THE FLAMES
OF TEMPTATION.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.298
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT JUST SAYS SO MUCH ABOUT ME

13:19.381 --> 13:20.883
IN THIS TATTOO.

13:20.966 --> 13:24.053
- COOL, MAN, WELL DONE.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.639

TELL US ABOUT THIS, SCOTT.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.108
REALLY NICE.

13:40.819 --> 13:43.364
- BEING THAT MY TATTOO
IS ON A WOMAN,

13:43.447 --> 13:47.243
I WANTED TO GIVE HER SOMETHING
THAT SHE COULD RELATE TO:

13:47.326 --> 13:48.911
LOVE AND HEARTACHE.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.705
MY TATTOO IS FEMININE
AND BEAUTIFUL,

13:51.789 --> 13:53.958
BUT IT STILL SHOWS
MY STYLE.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.501
- VERY COOL, MAN.
THANKS, GUYS.

13:55.584 --> 13:56.585
- THANK YOU.

15:15.914 --> 15:18.876
{\an8}- WELL, SHE WANTED A DESIGN

15:21.045 --> 15:24.882
{\an8}SO BASICALLY

{\an8}- EVERYBODY'S GOT
MORE WINS THAN I DO.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.803
{\an8}I'M NOWHERE NEAR SAFE

16:10.886 --> 16:11.303
{\an8}IT'S DO-OR-DIE TIME.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.389
{\an8}- THERE YOU GO.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.890
- ME AND SCOTT
HAVE A COMMON GOAL

- SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.244
THAT'S THE [bleep] GAME, BRO.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.287
- OKAY.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.957

16:43.168 --> 16:45.629
OF INK MASTER
TO ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.756
BUT FIRST, LET'S TALK TO
THE OTHER ARTISTS

16:47.840 --> 16:49.133
THAT COMPETED THIS SEASON.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.346
[cheers and applause]

16:54.430 --> 16:57.015
LET'S START OUT
WITH A TWEET, SHALL WE?

16:57.099 --> 17:00.060
THIS IS FROM HANNAH,
AND IT'S FOR HALO.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.854
{\an8}"I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED,
IN ABSOLUTE SHOCK,

17:01.937 --> 17:05.773
{\an8}THAT HALO IS NOT
IN THE FINAL THREE."

17:05.858 --> 17:06.983
{\an8}- HALO!
- HALO!

17:07.067 --> 17:08.152
- [laughs]
- I GOT TO TELL YOU.

17:08.234 --> 17:09.444
I WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.113
ARE YOU SURPRISED
YOU'RE NOT UP THERE?

17:11.195 --> 17:12.448
- YEAH, MAN,
I MEAN, EVERYTHING I DID

17:12.531 --> 17:13.406
IN THE COMPETITION
WAS TO WIN.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.784
{\an8}AND I WANTED TO DO THE BEST
I COULD.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.368
{\an8}ALL THE MOVES I MADE
WERE TO WIN.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.621
SO, BUT, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IT'S NOT MY DECISION.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.749
THE JUDGES
MADE THEIR DECISION, SO...

17:21.832 --> 17:22.875
- DUDE, COME ON.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.126
YOU THOUGHT YOU SHOULD
HAVE BEEN UP THERE

17:24.209 --> 17:25.419
IN THE TOP THREE.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.044
YOU KNOW YOU DID.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.296
YOU CAME IN NICE,

17:27.378 --> 17:30.466
YOU PLAYED THE GAME NICE,
AND IT BACKFIRED ON YOU.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.760
{\an8}- LOOK, DUDE.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.052
{\an8}- YOU'RE GOOD, HALO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.639
{\an8}- LOOK, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
MANIPULATIVE OR NOTHING.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.308
I DIDN'T TEAM UP
WITH ANYBODY.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.934
I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANYONE
BEHIND THEIR BACK.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.603
WHEN I TOOK YOU TO THE BOTTOM,
I TOLD YOU TO YOUR FACE.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.896
WHEN I TOLD SCOTT I WAS GONNA
GIVE HIM A SKULL,

17:43.979 --> 17:44.897
IT'S TO HIS FACE.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.190
THAT'S HOW I PLAYED THE GAME.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.067
YOU CAN BE A NICE GUY
AND STILL PLAY THE GAME.

17:48.150 --> 17:48.901
- NICE GUY
DIDN'T GET YOU NOWHERE, DUDE.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.653
{\an8}- FAIR ENOUGH.
FAIR ENOUGH.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.654
{\an8}NICE JOB, GUYS.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.864
{\an8}- WHATEVER.

17:53.947 --> 17:58.160
{\an8}- ANOTHER HOT TOPIC THIS SEASON
WAS "PLAYING THE GAME."

17:58.243 --> 17:59.578
{\an8}BRANDON TWEETED:

17:59.661 --> 18:00.829
{\an8}"EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP
COMPLAINING

18:00.913 --> 18:03.749
{\an8}AND PLAY THE GAME LIKE SCOTT."

18:05.876 --> 18:06.960
{\an8}MELISSA?

18:07.044 --> 18:08.837
{\an8}DO YOU HAVE
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT?

18:08.921 --> 18:12.216
{\an8}- WELL, SCOTT WAS DEFINITELY
VERY CUTTHROAT

18:12.299 --> 18:14.885
{\an8}WHERE I FEEL LIKE SAUSAGE PLAYED
WITH A BIT MORE INTEGRITY.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.887
{\an8}PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD HAVE TO

18:16.970 --> 18:19.389
{\an8}THROW PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS
TO WIN.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.183
- SCOTT.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.811
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT,
BUDDY?

18:23.894 --> 18:25.687
- THE REASON I PLAYED THE GAME
THE WAY I DID

18:25.771 --> 18:27.105
IS BECAUSE I WAS SICK AND TIRED

18:27.189 --> 18:29.858
OF EVERYONE TRYING TO
DISCREDIT ME EVERY TIME I WON.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.360
AND I DIDN'T SEE
YOU COMPLAINING

18:31.443 --> 18:32.694
ABOUT MY CUTTHROAT STRATEGY

18:32.778 --> 18:35.948
WHEN I HELPED YOU BEAT JAY
IN FACEOFF.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.366
- JAY, ANYTHING?

18:37.449 --> 18:38.992
- YEAH, I'D LIKE
TO COMMENT ON THAT.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.160
HE HAD TO DO THAT.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.537
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GET ME OUT.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.871
{\an8}HE KNOWS IF I WAS STANDING UP
THERE ON THE STAGE

18:42.955 --> 18:43.956
{\an8}WITH HIM RIGHT NOW,

18:44.039 --> 18:45.666
{\an8}YOU WOULD BE CALLING MY NAME
AS THE WINNER,

18:45.749 --> 18:48.085
{\an8}BUT INSTEAD HE HAD TO TEAM UP
WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE,

18:48.168 --> 18:50.212
{\an8}TAKE A CHEAP SHOT TO GET ME OUT.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.423
'CAUSE OTHERWISE, HE KNOWS,
NO REFERENCE,

18:53.507 --> 18:55.884
TATTOO FOR TATTOO,
I WOULD BEAT HIM EVERY TIME.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.219
AND THAT'S WHY HE DID
WHAT HE DID.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.679
- WOW.

18:58.762 --> 18:59.596
MAYBE SOME DAY WE'LL
GET A CHANCE TO SEE THAT, JAY.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.515
- OKAY.

19:01.598 --> 19:02.641
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.892
WE GOT TO MOVE ALONG.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.102
THANKS FOR BEING HERE, GUYS.

19:05.185 --> 19:09.106
[applause]

19:09.189 --> 19:11.066
THERE IS...

19:11.149 --> 19:14.778
THERE IS, HOWEVER, ONE ARTIST
THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YET.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.990
HE WAS VOTED BACK TO SEASON FOUR
AS AMERICA'S FAVORITE,

19:18.073 --> 19:21.827
BUT HIS RUN IN THE COMPETITION
CAME TO AN EXPLOSIVE END.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.913
WHEN WE COME BACK,
CHRIS NUÑEZ AND KYLE DUNBAR

19:24.997 --> 19:25.789
COME FACE TO FACE.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.000
[cheers and applause]

19:28.083 --> 19:31.044
AND WE HAVE
A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT

19:31.128 --> 19:32.629
ABOUT <i> INK MASTER</i> SEASON FIVE,

19:32.713 --> 19:34.506
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT
TO MISS THAT.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.799
KEEP IT HERE.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.969
[cheers and applause]

19:44.766 --> 19:48.729
[cheers and applause]

19:50.647 --> 19:53.275
- WELCOME BACK
TO <i> INK MASTER LIVE.</i>

19:53.358 --> 19:54.109
TIME IS RUNNING OUT
TO TWEET YOUR VOTE

19:54.192 --> 19:56.862
FOR SAUSAGE, MATTI, OR SCOTT.

19:56.945 --> 20:00.115
YOUR VOTE WILL GUARANTEE
ONE OF THESE THREE ARTISTS

20:00.198 --> 20:01.783
A SPOT IN FINAL TWO.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.660
SPEAKING OF VOTES, LAST SEASON,

20:03.744 --> 20:06.788
AMERICA VOTED TO BRING BACK
AN ARTIST FROM SEASON THREE

20:06.872 --> 20:09.958
FOR ANOTHER SHOT
AT THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.336
AND AS THE PRESSURE OF THIS
COMPETITION PILED ON,

20:12.419 --> 20:14.755
IT ERUPTED INTO ONE OF
THE MOST DRAMATIC

20:14.838 --> 20:16.965
<i>INK MASTER</i> EXITS EVER.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.468
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.802
KYLE.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.889
WE WILL BE SEEING YOU
ON <i> INK MASTER</i> SEASON FOUR.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.141
{\an8}- I WANT TO VALIDATE AMERICA
VOTING ME BACK.

20:26.224 --> 20:29.436
AS LONG AS I CAN KEEP MY HEAD
OUT OF MY ASS, I'M GOING TO WIN.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.271
WORD AROUND THE STREET IS,
I'M EXCELLENT.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.147
I THINK
I'M IN THE TOP FIVE.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.066
- YOU'RE NOT IN THE TOP FIVE.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.192
YOU'RE FALLING SHORT, BUD.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.194
- [bleep] THEM
PIECES OF [bleep].

20:37.277 --> 20:38.737
- IS YOUR COLOR
AS SOLID AS SCOTT'S?

20:38.820 --> 20:39.988
- YES, MINE ALWAYS--
- WRONG!

20:40.072 --> 20:41.698
I CANNOT STAND THIS TATTOO.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.325
- HE'S GOING TO TRY AND CALL ME
OUT ON [bleep].

20:43.408 --> 20:45.243
WHAT THE [bleep] IS WRONG
WITH THAT [bleep]?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.703
I DON'T NEED TO BE
ANYBODY'S [bleep] PUNCHING BAG.

20:46.787 --> 20:50.499
WHAT? WHAT?

20:50.582 --> 20:54.002
- THIS IS STUPID.
YOU'RE FIGHTING OVER A TATTOO?

20:54.086 --> 20:56.588
YOU CAME TO A [bleep] SHOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:56.672 --> 21:03.178
[applause]

21:03.261 --> 21:03.720
- LET'S BRING HIM BACK.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.223
KYLE DUNBAR!

21:06.306 --> 21:10.394
[cheers and applause]

21:12.062 --> 21:14.856
WHAT'S UP, KYLE?

21:14.940 --> 21:18.527
GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.570
GOOD TO SEE YOU, KYLE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

21:20.654 --> 21:22.072
- NERVOUS.

21:22.155 --> 21:22.906
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
YOU AND CHRIS

21:22.990 --> 21:24.408
ARE IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.994
- THAT'S WHY I'M NERVOUS.
- ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY?

21:27.077 --> 21:28.036
- HONEST...

21:28.120 --> 21:32.040
{\an8}YEAH, YOU KNOW,
AFTER WATCHING THE SEASON,

21:32.124 --> 21:33.709
{\an8}IT WAS EASY FOR ME
WHILE I WAS IN THE HOUSE

21:33.792 --> 21:35.877
{\an8}TO BE CONVINCED THAT I WAS
UNDER A PARANOID DELUSION,

21:35.961 --> 21:37.212
BUT HONESTLY,
WATCHING THE SEASON,

21:37.295 --> 21:38.547
I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.924
I FEEL LIKE I SUFFERED A BIT OF,
YOU KNOW,

21:41.008 --> 21:43.885
BIAS TREATMENT FROM YOU--
AT YOUR HAND.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.137
- REALLY?
CHRIS, ANY RESPONSE TO THAT?

21:45.220 --> 21:46.388
- WELL, HERE'S THE THING.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.139
I THINK WE MAKE IT
TO THIS POINT

21:47.222 --> 21:48.515
WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY

21:48.598 --> 21:51.727
AND YOU HAVE A WHOLE SEGMENT
DEDICATED TO YOURSELF.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.646
FROM THE WAY IT'S GONE,
YOU'VE MADE AN ENTIRE SEASON

21:54.730 --> 21:55.981
AND NOW YOU'RE BACK
FOR A SECOND SEASON,

21:56.064 --> 21:58.817
AND IT WAS ALL THROUGH US
PUSHING, AND WE DID PUSH.

21:58.900 --> 21:59.818
[man yells]

21:59.901 --> 22:00.527
NO, BUT LISTEN.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.362
WE DID PUSH TO GET YOU

22:02.446 --> 22:04.281
TO THE FINAL FOUR
IN THE FIRST SEASON.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.657
AND YOU RESPONDED TO CRITIQUE,

22:05.741 --> 22:07.409
AND THAT HARD TIME,
YOU CAME BACK.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.243
SO WE WERE ALWAYS LIKE,
"HEY, MAN.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.244
"THIS IS A GUY WHO WANTS IT

22:09.327 --> 22:11.621
"AND EVERY TIME
WE GIVE HIM [bleep],

22:11.705 --> 22:12.914
HE COMES BACK STRONGER."

22:12.998 --> 22:15.292
SO THE MATH WAS THERE.
THE FORMULA WAS THERE.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.793
WE JUST KEPT GOING.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.920
YOU KNOW, IT JUST DIDN'T
WORK OUT THIS TIME.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.174
{\an8}- I FELT THAT THE BIAS
WAS NO MORE EVIDENT

22:22.257 --> 22:23.717
{\an8}THAN WHEN YOU CALLED ME UP.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.678
{\an8}YOU TOLD ME I COULD HAVE
JUSTIFIABLY GONE HOME.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.264
{\an8}AND I DIDN'T SEE MY NAME
COME UP IN THE DELIBERATION.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.516
AND I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE
JUSTIFIABLY GONE HOME THAT DAY.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.477
BUT NO ONE ELSE
HAD TO GO TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT

22:33.560 --> 22:36.521
THINKING THAT A JUDGE
WAS OUT TO GET HIM.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.483
AND I BELIEVE IT PUT A LITTLE
BIT OF UNDUE PRESSURE ON ME.

22:39.566 --> 22:39.983
- THIS IS THE GAME, THOUGH.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.319
- [cheers]

22:42.402 --> 22:44.196
- THIS IS THE GAME, BROTHER,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.739
AND YOU CAME BACK, RIGHT?

22:45.822 --> 22:47.032
YOU CAME BACK A SECOND TIME,

22:47.115 --> 22:48.742
AND BABY WENT THROUGH
THE SAME THING, RIGHT?

22:48.825 --> 22:50.827
TATU BABY CAME BACK
FOR THE SECOND TIME

22:50.911 --> 22:51.620
AND JUST TOOK A BEATING.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.622
IT'S TOUGH TO COME BACK,

22:53.705 --> 22:56.291
BUT YOU DID, AND YOU KNEW
THE WAY IT WENT,

22:56.375 --> 22:58.460
AND I THINK IT WAS REALLY
TRYING TO GET YOU

22:58.543 --> 23:01.129
TO BE BETTER THAN WHAT YOU WERE
AND TO BEAT OUT PEOPLE

23:01.213 --> 23:02.631
THAT WEREN'T AS GOOD AS YOU.

23:02.714 --> 23:03.799
WE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU
GO HOME BEFORE THAT.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.968
- LET ME PASS THIS TO ASHLEY
FOR A MOMENT.

23:07.052 --> 23:11.014
ASHLEY, KYLE SNAPPED AT YOU
FOR CRACKING UNDER THE PRESSURE

23:11.098 --> 23:13.433
AND THEN DID
THE EXACT SAME THING.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.810
DO YOU FEEL REDEEMED?

23:14.893 --> 23:16.561
{\an8}- KARMA'S A BITCH. I MEAN...

23:16.645 --> 23:18.522
{\an8}- WOW.

23:18.605 --> 23:19.898
{\an8}- KYLE, I GOT TO SAY, MAN.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.149
{\an8}YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.734
IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR HEAD
OUT OF YOUR OWN ASS,

23:22.818 --> 23:24.986
YOU WOULD HAVE WON,
AND YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.196
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

23:26.279 --> 23:30.200
YOU KNOW, IT FELT LIKE YOU GUYS

23:30.283 --> 23:32.536
YOU GUYS GIVE SOME PEOPLE WHAT

23:32.619 --> 23:34.454
SEEMED TO BE PREFERENTIAL
TREATMENT.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.664
AND OTHERS, YOU KNOW--

23:35.747 --> 23:36.206
- I WOULD LOVE TO DO AN HOUR
ON THIS.

23:36.289 --> 23:37.749
I REALLY WOULD.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.084
I GOT TO WRAP IT UP.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.669
UNFORTUNATELY WE GOT TO
WRAP THIS UP.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.254
THANKS FOR BEING HERE, KYLE.

23:42.337 --> 23:43.672
AND PLEASE HAVE A SEAT
WITH THE GUYS.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.006
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.174
[cheers and applause]

23:46.258 --> 23:47.217
ONE THING THAT'S FOR SURE:

23:47.300 --> 23:49.803
THIS COMPETITION IS INTENSE,

23:49.886 --> 23:52.597
AND NOBODY KNOWS THAT
BETTER THAN SEASON THREE WINNER,

23:52.681 --> 23:54.015
JOEY HAMILTON.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.350
THANKS TO TACO BELL,

23:55.433 --> 23:58.145
JOEY IS TATTOOING LIVE
RIGHT NOW.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.188
JOEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

24:00.272 --> 24:02.190
- WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

24:02.274 --> 24:03.650
- HEY, BUDDY,
YOU WON <i> INK MASTER.</i>

24:03.733 --> 24:05.068
HOW'S THAT CHANGED YOUR LIFE?

24:05.152 --> 24:07.445
{\an8}- OH, WELL, DEFINITELY
MY LIFE'S BEEN VERY HECTIC

24:07.529 --> 24:09.239
{\an8}SINCE I WON <i> INK MASTER.</i>

24:09.322 --> 24:10.699
{\an8}I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF CONVENTIONS,

24:10.782 --> 24:14.244
{\an8}TATTOOING FULL-TIME
AT CLUB TATTOO LAS VEGAS.

24:14.327 --> 24:16.371
AND I HONESTLY JUST CAN'T WAIT
TO TAKE A BREAK

24:16.454 --> 24:17.080
AND GO ON VACATION WITH MY WIFE.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.332
- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

24:19.416 --> 24:23.378
WELL, YOU GOT 15 MINUTES
LEFT UP THERE, OKAY?

24:23.461 --> 24:26.298
SO WE'LL CHECK OUT
YOUR TATTOO AFTER THAT.

24:26.381 --> 24:27.507
ALL RIGHT, AMERICA.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.468
TONIGHT WE HAVE A HUGE,
HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.553
ON SEASON FIVE OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

24:31.636 --> 24:34.723
EVERY ARTIST
COMING TO THE COMPETITION

24:34.806 --> 24:36.892
IS GOING TO BE BRINGING A RIVAL.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.895
NOT ONLY ARE THEY OUT TO WIN
THE TITLE OF INK MASTER,

24:39.978 --> 24:43.565
THEY'RE COMING
TO SETTLE A PERSONAL VENDETTA.

24:43.648 --> 24:47.569
AND WE'RE ALSO BRINGING BACK
TWO OF THE MOST INFAMOUS RIVALS

24:47.652 --> 24:49.613
IN <i> INK MASTER</i> HISTORY.

24:49.696 --> 24:50.947
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.742
{\an8}- I'M HERE TO WIN
IN ANY WAY I CAN.

24:53.825 --> 24:57.412
{\an8}MY STRATEGY IS NOT LETTING
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT MY STRATEGY IS.

24:57.495 --> 25:00.582
{\an8}- JOSH, YOU'RE IN THIS GAME
TO TRIP EVERY [bleep] HERE.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.125
JOSH WAS FULL OF [bleep].

25:02.209 --> 25:04.085
YOU'RE PLAYING A STUPID GAME,
YOU IDIOT.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.420
- I'M NOT JUDGING HER
FOR HER CHOICES.

25:05.503 --> 25:08.465
- YOU DID JUST JUDGE HER
FOR HER CHOICES.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.842
DON'T FLIP-FLOP, MOTHER[bleep].

25:10.926 --> 25:12.260
- I JUST SLIPPED INTO THE ROLE
OF BEING THE BAD GUY.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.430
- THE DIFFERENCE HERE, BRO, IS,
I WANT A HEALTHY COMPETITION.

25:15.513 --> 25:17.724
YOU DO [bleep]
OUT OF MALICIOUS INTENT.

25:17.807 --> 25:18.934
- SO NOW YOU SEE WHAT
I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH.

25:19.017 --> 25:19.935
- THAT'S BULL[bleep], JOSH.

25:20.018 --> 25:20.727
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

25:25.273 --> 25:27.442
WOW.

25:27.525 --> 25:31.321
YOU TWO.

25:31.404 --> 25:32.614
YOU GUYS READY?

25:32.697 --> 25:34.115
[cheers and applause]

25:34.199 --> 25:36.576
THAT'S NOT HELPING US.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.120
YOU GUYS READY TO COMPETE AGAIN
ON SEASON FIVE?

25:39.204 --> 25:41.706
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD A LOT OF
TIME TO IMPROVE MYSELF

25:41.790 --> 25:43.667
{\an8}AS AN ARTIST AND MY TATTOOS.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.752
{\an8}- AS A PERSON, ALSO?

25:45.835 --> 25:47.128
{\an8}- YOU KNOW,
AS A PERSON AS WELL.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.296
YOU KNOW, IT'S A CONSTANT--
BEING AN ARTIST,

25:48.380 --> 25:49.673
AS PART OF LIFE IN GENERAL.

25:49.756 --> 25:51.758
YOU KNOW, AND IT'S JUST
IMPROVING YOURSELF.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.760
SO, YOU KNOW, IF WE END UP
IN THE FINALE TOGETHER,

25:53.843 --> 25:55.929
YOU BETTER WATCH OUT BECAUSE
I'M DEFINITELY PREPARED.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.097
AND I HOPE YOU ARE.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.640
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.184
I DIDN'T NEED A WHOLE YEAR
TO PREPARE FOR YOU.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.769
{\an8}BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS--

26:02.852 --> 26:04.938
{\an8}EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS I'M
A MORE WELL-ROUNDED ARTIST

26:05.021 --> 26:06.231
{\an8}THAN YOU'LL EVER BE, DUDE.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.649
{\an8}SO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU BETTER BRING IT, BROTHER.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.150
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.068
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE
THAT NOTHING'S CHANGED

26:10.151 --> 26:12.070
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

26:12.153 --> 26:14.239
DON'T FORGET TO TUNE IN
FOR THE <i> INK MASTER RIVALS</i>

26:14.322 --> 26:15.448
SEPTEMBER 2ND.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.033
GUYS, THANKS FOR JOINING US.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.996
GOOD LUCK TO BOTH OF YOU.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.665
ALL RIGHT, AMERICA,
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE

26:23.748 --> 26:27.168
TO TWEET YOUR VOTE FOR SAUSAGE,
MATTI, OR SCOTT.

26:27.252 --> 26:30.964
{\an8}TWEET NOW TO GUARANTEE ONE OF
THEM A SPOT IN THE TOP TWO.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.966
AND WHEN WE COME BACK,
VOTING WILL CLOSE,

26:33.049 --> 26:37.762
AND THE JUDGES WILL FINALLY
CRITIQUE THE MASTER CANVASES.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.348
AND ONE OF THESE THREE ARTISTS
IS ABOUT TO LOSE HIS SHOT

26:40.432 --> 26:42.726
AT THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

26:42.809 --> 26:43.435
DON'T GO AWAY.

26:43.518 --> 26:50.191
[cheers and applause]

26:54.946 --> 27:00.076
[cheers and applause]

27:03.121 --> 27:04.873
- WELCOME BACK.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.208
TONIGHT, AMERICA, YOU'VE BEEN
VOTING ON THE FINAL TATTOOS.

27:07.292 --> 27:11.546
BUT NOW TIME IS UP,
AND VOTING IS CLOSED.

27:11.629 --> 27:14.883
WE'LL REVEAL THE RESULTS OF
YOUR VOTE IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS,

27:14.966 --> 27:17.886
BUT FIRST LET'S HEAR
WHAT THE JUDGES THINK.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.638
IT'S TIME TO CRITIQUE
YOUR FINAL TATTOOS.

27:20.722 --> 27:25.060
SAUSAGE, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.895
- [exhales]
- OLLIE.

27:26.978 --> 27:30.231
- ALL RIGHT, SAUSAGE, FIRST OFF,
MAN, VERY NICE DESIGN.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.442
- THANK YOU.
- VERY NICE FIT OF THE BODY.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.902
I LOVE THE WAY
IT FLOWS WITH THE CURVES.

27:33.985 --> 27:37.739
I LOVE THE WAY IT TIES IN
TO HER PREVIOUS TATTOOS.

27:37.822 --> 27:38.865
VERY GOOD ATTENTION TO DETAIL
ON THIS ONE,

27:38.948 --> 27:43.578
A LOT OF BIG OPEN AREAS,
A LOT OF NICE COLOR.

27:43.661 --> 27:48.541
NO REALLY STANDOUT
ANATOMICAL FLAWS

27:48.625 --> 27:51.002
THAT I CAN BEAT YOU UP OVER.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.630
I'M A LITTLE WEARY
ON HOW THAT BIRD

27:53.713 --> 27:56.132
JUST POPS OUT OF THE BACK
OF THE DESIGN

27:56.216 --> 27:57.634
WITHOUT REALLY FLOWING
WITH THE GIRL SO MUCH.

27:57.717 --> 28:00.387
BUT THAT'S JUST NITPICKING,
REALLY.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.430
I MEAN, OVERALL,
IT'S A GREAT DESIGN.

28:02.514 --> 28:06.935
{\an8}MY BIG QUESTION FOR YOU
IS YOUR COLOR SATURATION.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.603
{\an8}THROUGHOUT THIS COMPETITION,

28:08.686 --> 28:10.313
{\an8}WE'VE SEEN YOU DO A LOT
OF BRIGHT COLOR.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.606
WE'VE SEEN YOU BE
VERY VERSATILE,

28:11.689 --> 28:13.108
VERY SMOOTH SHADING.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.068
THIS ONE, YOUR SATURATION
SEEMS TO BE--

28:15.151 --> 28:17.654
HAVE SOME AREAS
THAT IT'S JUST NOT AS SOLID

28:17.737 --> 28:19.739
AS WHAT WE'RE USED TO
FROM YOU.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.117
- I KNOW,
THIS ENTIRE COMPETITION,

28:22.200 --> 28:25.829
THAT YOU AND NUÑEZ REALLY
DON'T LIKE WALL-TO-WALL COLOR.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.122
AND I TRIED TO TAKE THAT
INTO MY ARSENAL

28:27.205 --> 28:29.707
AND PRODUCE A PIECE
THAT HAD A LOT OF SKIN BREAKS.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.252
I FEEL THAT IF I WOULD HAVE
WENT IN THERE

28:32.335 --> 28:35.255
AND JUST DOMINATED THE THING
WITH REALLY RICH BLACK

28:35.338 --> 28:38.633
THAT I THINK THAT IT WOULD HAVE
LOST ITS FEMININITY.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.135
- WELL, SAUSAGE,
LET ME SAY THAT,

28:40.218 --> 28:42.762
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY NICE
TO SEE THE TATTOO BREATHE,

28:42.846 --> 28:46.141
AND WHAT YOU DID
WITH THE REALLY BOLD AREAS

28:46.224 --> 28:48.017
AND THEN THE REALLY
FINE LINE AREAS

28:48.101 --> 28:49.436
IS WHAT WE ALWAYS LOOK FOR,

28:49.519 --> 28:50.562
SOMEBODY THAT CAN MIX IT UP
AND REALLY SHOW OFF

28:50.645 --> 28:51.688
A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING,

28:51.771 --> 28:54.274
BUT LOOKING AT
YOUR WHOLE BODY OF WORK,

28:54.357 --> 28:56.818
I DO AGREE WITH OLLIE THAT IT--

28:56.901 --> 28:58.987
THERE ARE POINTS IN IT
WHERE THE COLOR IS THERE

28:59.070 --> 29:00.029
WHERE IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK
AS STRONG

29:00.113 --> 29:01.156
AS YOU USUALLY PUNCH IT IN.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.407
YOU KNOW?

29:02.490 --> 29:03.366
DO YOU DO A LOT
OF BIG STUFF LIKE THIS?

29:03.450 --> 29:05.118
- NOT IN THIS SHORT OF TIME.

29:05.201 --> 29:08.329
USUALLY IT TAKES A LOT LONGER
TO GO OVER SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.207
TO KNOCK THIS OUT IN, YOU KNOW,
A MATTER OF A COUPLE MONTHS,

29:11.291 --> 29:12.917
I MEAN, IT WAS--
THAT WAS A HUGE UNDERTAKING.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.002
AND IT'S A LOT OF TORTURE
ON THE SKIN

29:14.085 --> 29:16.463
AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S
HEALING PROBLEMS

29:16.546 --> 29:18.506
AND STUFF LIKE THAT IN IT TOO,
BUT--

29:18.590 --> 29:20.133
I WAS VERY COMFORTABLE
WITH THIS PIECE.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.509
35 BLEW BY.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.510
- GOT IT.
- THANKS, BUDDY.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.680
MATTI, YOU'RE UP NEXT.

29:25.763 --> 29:27.765
[applause]

29:30.685 --> 29:32.437
MR. PECK.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.856
- ONE THING WE'VE SEEN FROM YOU
ALL SEASON LONG, MATTI,

29:34.939 --> 29:37.859
IS THAT YOU REALLY HAVE
GREAT COMPOSITION

29:37.942 --> 29:39.360
AND FITTING STUFF TO THE BODY.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.404
ONCE AGAIN,
YOU PULLED IT OFF HERE.

29:41.488 --> 29:44.282
THIS DESIGN--YOU DIDN'T PUT
THE FACE SOMEWHERE

29:44.365 --> 29:46.576
ON THE SHAPE OF THE SHOULDER
THAT'S GONNA DISTORT IT.

29:46.659 --> 29:50.079
EVERYTHING LOOKS REALLY--
REALLY NICE AND REALLY BOLD.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.999
THERE'S A FEW QUESTIONABLE AREAS
ANATOMICALLY, MAN.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.293
THIS GIRL'S NECK
LOOKS A LITTLE BIT

29:55.376 --> 29:57.045
WRENCHED OUT OF SHAPE.

29:57.128 --> 30:00.715
THE--SOME OF THE CURVES
IN THAT SNAKE

30:00.798 --> 30:02.884
COULD HAVE BEEN ARTISTICALLY
DESIGNED A LITTLE BIT BETTER

30:02.967 --> 30:05.678
TO FIT THIS TATTOO
TO MAKE IT FLOW SMOOTHER

30:05.762 --> 30:09.974
BUT THE ENDING OF THIS TATTOO
IS THE BIG PROBLEM I HAVE.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.477
THE BOTTOM, THE YELLOW,
THE ORANGE AT THE BOTTOM

30:12.560 --> 30:13.895
THAT FADES OFF
AND GOES INTO THE SNAKE,

30:13.978 --> 30:17.357
IT JUST LOOKS RUSHED
AND A LITTLE UNFINISHED.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.359
HOW--WERE YOU--WAS TIME
AN ISSUE ON THIS TATTOO?

30:19.442 --> 30:21.569
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.737
WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING
THIS SIZE,

30:22.820 --> 30:24.572
YOU KNOW, TIME IS ALWAYS
GOING TO BE AN ISSUE.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.115
AND YOU COULD GO OVER
ONE OF THESE THINGS, LIKE,

30:26.199 --> 30:27.075
A THOUSAND TIMES
AND STILL, LIKE,

30:27.158 --> 30:28.451
WISH YOU COULD DO MORE,
YOU KNOW?

30:28.535 --> 30:32.247
{\an8}THE BOTTOM I LEFT PRETTY LIGHT
JUST BECAUSE IT SOFTENS UP,

30:32.330 --> 30:33.373
{\an8}YOU KNOW?

30:33.456 --> 30:35.959
{\an8}AND IF IT'S A LITTLE LIGHT
DOWN THERE,

30:36.042 --> 30:37.252
THAT'S FINE FOR ME.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.420
WITH THE PLACEMENT OF A LOT
OF THE THINGS IN HERE,

30:39.504 --> 30:40.838
IT WAS FOR A REASON.

30:40.922 --> 30:44.259
THERE IS A HIDDEN FIBONACCI
GOLDEN SPIRAL

30:44.342 --> 30:46.052
THAT GOES THROUGH
THIS ENTIRE TATTOO,

30:46.135 --> 30:47.845
AND IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT HAD A LOT OF MEANING TO ME

30:47.929 --> 30:51.849
AS FAR AS THE MESSAGE
OF THE PIECE.

30:51.933 --> 30:52.934
- CHRIS.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.602
- WELL, MATTI, I GOT TO SAY,
YOU KNOW,

30:54.686 --> 30:56.938
I'VE LIKED YOUR TATTOOING
THROUGH THE ENTIRE COMPETITION--

30:57.021 --> 30:58.147
ALL YOU GUYS.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.358
BUT, YOU KNOW,
TO REALLY LOOK AT THE LAYOUT

31:00.441 --> 31:03.444
OF THIS TATTOO, I THINK YOU DID
A REALLY NICE JOB.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.113
THE AREA OF THIS TATTOO
IS LAYING OUT A BACK--

31:05.196 --> 31:08.575
MAYBE IN HER HAIR WHERE YOU
HAVE ALL THAT RICH BLACK--

31:08.658 --> 31:10.785
TO REALLY BRING IT
AND MAKE IT FLOW WITH THE BODY

31:10.868 --> 31:12.412
SO IT'S NOT SUCH
AN ABRUPT ENDING,

31:12.495 --> 31:14.497
TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE
A BACK PIECE,

31:14.581 --> 31:16.958
TO HAVE ITS OPEN AREAS
AND ITS SOLID AREAS,

31:17.041 --> 31:19.210
TO MAKE IT FLOW
WITH COMPOSITION ON THE BODY.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.795
SINCE YOU'RE UP AGAINST
OTHER ARTISTS

31:20.878 --> 31:23.423
THAT ARE EQUALLY DOING
BACK PIECES,

31:23.506 --> 31:26.593
THAT'S REALLY THE PART OF
THIS TATTOO I THINK THAT,

31:26.676 --> 31:28.469
YOU KNOW, IT COULD HAVE USED
A LITTLE MORE WORK.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.387
- OKAY.
- THANKS, MATTI.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.514
- THANK YOU.

31:31.598 --> 31:37.353
- SCOTT, YOU'RE UP NEXT, BUDDY.

31:37.437 --> 31:37.937
ANY THOUGHTS FOR SCOTT?

31:38.021 --> 31:40.064
- HEY, SCOTT.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.566
YOU AND SAUSAGE BEING
NECK AND NECK

31:41.649 --> 31:43.735
THIS WHOLE COMPETITION,
IT'S REALLY CRAZY TO ME

31:43.818 --> 31:46.112
HOW SIMILAR
YOUR TWO DESIGNS ARE,

31:46.195 --> 31:49.490
BUT YOUR DYNAMIC COLOR REALLY
PUNCHES FORWARD THIS DESIGN,

31:49.574 --> 31:50.950
REALLY BRINGS THIS THING
TO LIFE,

31:51.034 --> 31:52.952
AND IT JUST IS SO STRIKING.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.829
IT'S A BIG, BOLD, STRIKING IMAGE
TO LOOK AT.

31:54.912 --> 31:58.708
THE WAY THAT YOU ENDED
THE TATTOO

31:58.791 --> 32:01.669
ON ONE SIDE OF HER HAIR
IN THE BACK OF HER NECK,

32:01.753 --> 32:04.047
HOW IT JUST KIND OF
TRAILS OFF,

32:04.130 --> 32:06.424
I FEEL LIKE YOU SPENT
SO MUCH TIME

32:06.507 --> 32:08.676
DESIGNING THE KEY ELEMENTS

32:08.760 --> 32:11.054
THAT YOU DIDN'T PUT ENOUGH
EFFORT

32:11.137 --> 32:12.472
INTO HOW THIS THING
WAS GOING TO FINISH.

32:12.555 --> 32:15.725
YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE AS FAR
AS GETTING THE SATURATION

32:15.808 --> 32:18.686
IN THERE, GETTING YOUR SOLID
BLACK LINES AND BLACK COLOR,

32:18.770 --> 32:19.979
IT IS SO VIBRANT.

32:20.063 --> 32:23.191
YOU SPENT ALL YOUR CONCENTRATION
ON THOSE THINGS,

32:23.274 --> 32:28.529
AND THERE'S A FEW AREAS THAT
MIGHT BE A LITTLE LACKLUSTER.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.782
ALSO THE SHAPE
OF THIS GIRL'S FACE

32:30.865 --> 32:33.743
IS A LITTLE--
IS A LITTLE WONKY.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.578
I LOVE THE DYNAMIC HAND
IN THE HEART, THOUGH.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.413
THAT'S THE FOCAL POINT
OF THIS TATTOO FOR ME,

32:37.497 --> 32:40.500
{\an8}AND IT STANDS OUT,
AND IT IS SO STRONG.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.627
{\an8}- WELL, I BELIEVE THAT WHEN I
MADE THE COMPOSITION,

32:42.710 --> 32:43.961
{\an8}I WANTED IT TO BREATHE, SO--

32:44.045 --> 32:46.172
{\an8}BECAUSE I DID SO MUCH COLOR
IN IT--

32:46.255 --> 32:50.093
THAT I WANTED IT TO JUST
FADE OUT AND HAVE A NICE FLOW.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.136
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE MOTHS
AND THE SNAKES

32:52.220 --> 32:54.639
AND ALL THAT OMINOUS DEATH
IN THE BACK OF HER FACE,

32:54.722 --> 32:56.140
IT'S ALL FLOWING UP
TOWARDS THE HEART,

32:56.224 --> 33:00.353
BRINGING THE PRIORITY
TO THE HEART, YOU KNOW?

33:00.436 --> 33:02.480
- THE LITTLE SUBTLE DETAILS
YOU PUT IN HERE

33:02.563 --> 33:05.024
LIKE IN THE RINGS AND THE LITTLE
H.R. TRIBUTE

33:05.108 --> 33:06.943
YOU PUT IN HER CHEEK
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

33:07.026 --> 33:08.069
THAT STUFF REALLY STRUCK US,
MAN.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.112
WE REALLY LIKED THAT.

33:09.195 --> 33:09.529
- COOL MAN, THANKS.

33:09.612 --> 33:11.239
- CHRIS.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.615
- YEAH, SCOTT, I MEAN,

33:12.699 --> 33:14.075
THE THING ABOUT THIS TATTOO
IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT

33:14.158 --> 33:16.744
ANY OF YOUR TATTOOS
THROUGH THE COMPETITION,

33:16.828 --> 33:19.580
YOU LOOK AT THIS, THIS IS JUST
ANOTHER TATTOO THAT YOU DID,

33:19.664 --> 33:23.334
BUT IT'S 35 HOURS.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.587
ONE OF THE AREAS--
I AGREE WITH OLLIE, HER FACE--

33:26.671 --> 33:29.424
I FEEL LIKE IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE DIFFERENT SHAPE.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.675
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

33:30.758 --> 33:33.803
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE PRETTIER, I THINK,

33:33.886 --> 33:36.347
MAYBE MAKING HER HAVE THAT--

33:36.431 --> 33:37.807
THE SOULLESS EYES
KIND OF THING,

33:37.890 --> 33:41.269
MAYBE CHANGE THE SHAPE
OF THE LEFT EYE WITH THE CHEEK,

33:41.352 --> 33:43.646
BUT OVERALL,
THE FLOW OF THIS TATTOO

33:43.730 --> 33:46.274
AND THE WAY
IT RIDES THE ACTUAL BODY

33:46.357 --> 33:49.110
AND THE COLOR SATURATION
THAT YOU HAVE IN HERE,

33:49.193 --> 33:50.653
NOBODY CAN QUESTION THAT.

33:50.737 --> 33:53.197
THE HAND AND THE HEART IS WHAT
STICKS OUT TO US FOR SURE.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.532
WE LOVE IT.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.784
- THANK YOU.
- REALLY NICE, MAN. THANK YOU.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.871
[applause]

34:01.080 --> 34:03.583
- ALL RIGHT, WE'VE HEARD
WHAT THE JUDGES THINK.

34:03.666 --> 34:06.461
NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT
WHAT YOU DECIDED.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.713
THE VOTES ARE TALLIED.

34:08.795 --> 34:12.592
THE ARTIST WHO YOU THINK
DESERVES TO BE IN THE FINAL TWO

34:12.675 --> 34:16.304
