WEBVTT

00:37.620 --> 00:39.622


00:39.998 --> 00:41.416
Make a wish, darlin'.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.677
I have had nothing but lousy birthdays.

00:52.761 --> 00:56.931
But getting robbed last year
at Captain Bear's was the worst.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.683
-
Worse than the flash flood

00:58.767 --> 01:00.060
-or the food poisoning...

01:00.143 --> 01:02.979
...or the year you got hit
in the neck by a foul ball?

01:03.063 --> 01:03.980
Yes.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.316
Well, you've had
some rough ones, all right.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.652
The only one who seems to enjoy
your birthday is Dale.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.280
Well, this year,
I am finally gonna have a birthday

01:12.363 --> 01:14.115
that Dale cannot gloat about.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.910
We are going on a Murder Mystery Train.

01:16.993 --> 01:20.914
-That sounds great!
Aw, sorry, honey. Kids aren't allowed.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.290
-

01:22.373 --> 01:24.834
Being a kid is not fair.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.503


01:26.586 --> 01:29.839
I'll bring you a placemat.
Here's what he'll be missing.

01:29.964 --> 01:30.840


01:30.924 --> 01:33.760
Huh. "A Chubb Randolph Production."

01:33.843 --> 01:37.347
It's a four-hour round trip to Durndle,
dinner inclusive.

01:37.430 --> 01:42.060
Actors will be enacting a theme murder
mystery, and we get to solve it.

01:42.143 --> 01:46.064
-Theme?
-Yes, the theme is Studio 54.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.483
"Death Gets on the Guest List."

01:49.484 --> 01:50.652
Disco, huh.

01:50.735 --> 01:54.155
You sure they didn't have
a "Murder at the Super Bowl" theme

01:54.239 --> 01:56.157
or "Murder on a Bass Boat"?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.534
It'll be fun, Hank.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.202
<i>♪ Gotta get the funk, Hank! ♪</i>

01:59.285 --> 02:02.497
<i>♪ On the dance floor! That's right.
Come on, rock the boat, Hank! ♪</i>

02:02.580 --> 02:04.249
<i>♪ Do the bump-bump. Yeah! ♪</i>

02:08.044 --> 02:12.006
Well, the whole idea
of a disco party makes my skin crawl,

02:12.090 --> 02:13.883
but it means a lot to Peggy.

02:13.967 --> 02:18.763
And it does involve a train.
I guess I'll just focus on that.

02:18.847 --> 02:22.016
Oh, I've got a mesh tank top,
I'm gonna wear!

02:22.100 --> 02:24.227
I like the way it mats my body hair.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.438
Good call, Bill.
We'll all trot out our disco finery

02:27.522 --> 02:29.691
and wait for disaster to strike.

02:29.774 --> 02:33.486
I bet that will happen if the driver
of the train is the murder victim.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.782
Unfortunately, no.
All trains have a "Dead Man's Brake."

02:37.866 --> 02:41.077
The driver has to keep his hand
on the throttle at all times.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.372
If the driver gets murdered
and he takes his hand off,

02:44.455 --> 02:48.418
the train will automatically come
to a screeching, but safe, halt.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.920
So, this year when we tell Peggy
happy birthday,

02:51.004 --> 02:53.173
it won't sound sarcastic and mean.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.465
Not a chance.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.926
Peggy's had some classic stinkers before,

02:57.010 --> 03:00.722
but this one could be a fiasco
of spectacular proportions.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.766
It could literally be a train wreck!

03:08.146 --> 03:09.564
Hoo! Hoo!

03:10.565 --> 03:12.066
Hoo! Hoo!

03:12.775 --> 03:16.321
I am glittered, glammed,
and ready to hustle!

03:19.240 --> 03:22.785
Everything feels tight. And European.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.663
Every stitch in your clothes
was made by DuPont.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.498
-Feel any better?
-A little.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.880
Now, Bobby, we're trusting you kids
to stay right here

03:33.963 --> 03:35.965
and keep out of trouble
until your mother and I,

03:36.049 --> 03:38.843
have successfully completed her birthday.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.261
Okay.

03:43.973 --> 03:47.560
Well, there it is. Studio 54.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.271
I want to stand behind a velvet rope!

03:50.355 --> 03:53.900
I feel a little guilty that I'm gonna be
the one solving the mystery.

03:53.983 --> 03:58.029
-Oh, really. You sure about that, Lucky?
-Yes, ma'am.

03:58.112 --> 04:01.866
See, I've got an unfair advantage.
Thanks to TV Land reruns,

04:01.950 --> 04:05.036
I'm a bit of a student
of the NBC Mystery Wheel,

04:05.119 --> 04:08.331
<i>Columbo, McCloud</i>, <i>McMillan and Wife</i>,

04:08.414 --> 04:12.252
and the underappreciated prairie
detective <i>Hec Ramsey</i>.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.962
That was a good show.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.632
I remember one where the murder weapon
was a Gila monster.

04:18.758 --> 04:23.930
Lovely lady, I'm Lawrence Robbins,
although tonight I'll be playing Halston.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.765
One of our actresses didn't show.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.725
How would you like to be in the program?

04:27.809 --> 04:30.228
All you have to do is be blond and pretty.

04:31.312 --> 04:35.817
-I can do both those things!
-Follow me. I'll tell you about your part.

04:40.530 --> 04:45.159
Wait. This is the longest we've ever been
together without our parents.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.746
We've gotta do something
we could never do if they were around.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.292
We could pee in places where pee
isn't supposed to go.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.796
I know, let's make prank phone calls.

04:56.879 --> 05:00.258
Mmm... Sounds too risky.
Everybody's got caller ID now.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.010
What if we made a secret clubhouse?

05:02.093 --> 05:04.721
You mean with passwords and secret knocks?

05:04.804 --> 05:05.763
Cool!

05:05.847 --> 05:09.559
Yeah, and we can use things
that aren't furniture as furniture.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.104
And things that aren't urinals as urinals!
I'm in!

05:17.233 --> 05:19.277
Hey, Peggy, happy birthday, man.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.779
I want you to meet ol' dang
ol' Rhonda here, man.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.824
She's hearing-impaired,

05:24.907 --> 05:28.119
but she communicates with dang ol'
language of love,

05:28.202 --> 05:30.079
you know, hot, man.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.042
P.J., Bob, I'm so glad you could make it.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.336
I thought you were gonna both
be "plus one."

05:36.419 --> 05:38.629
We decided to leave the wives
at home tonight.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.173
No chicks!

05:40.840 --> 05:43.259
Hey, Hank Hill. Remember the '70s?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.137
My people ambushing your people
in the jungle.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.599
Look! There's Jackie O.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.073
This is wonderful.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.369
I'm Conductor Nolan.
I am a railway employee

06:09.452 --> 06:12.205
and am in no way affiliated
with Chubb Randolph Productions.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.539
I'm warning you now,

06:13.623 --> 06:16.000
I am not going to put up with
any foolishness.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.629
I am empowered to take all necessary
actions to protect this train.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.839
Done it before, I'll do it again.

06:23.132 --> 06:27.345
Fun within prescribed limits.
This is gonna work!

06:27.428 --> 06:28.805
All aboard!

06:30.515 --> 06:32.266
Aunt Peggy, Uncle Hank!

06:32.350 --> 06:35.478
I'm playing a model called Jerry Hall!

06:35.561 --> 06:37.605
That is wonderful, honey.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.190
Who is Roy Cohn?

06:39.273 --> 06:42.235
Senator Joseph McCarthy's
pit bull lawyer.

06:42.318 --> 06:45.488
A voracious man who took no quarter
in the courtroom

06:45.571 --> 06:49.784
or the amyl nitrate-perfumed lounges
of Studio 54.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.205
Why would he want to kill me,
I mean, Jerry Hall?

06:55.206 --> 06:57.500
No. Oh, no. No, Luanne, no.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.670
Roy Cohn did it!

07:00.753 --> 07:03.047
-Aw.
-Ah, mystery blown!

07:03.131 --> 07:04.715
Doggone it.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.510
Let's go.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.347
No, no, stay. You could do improv!

07:11.431 --> 07:15.101
No. Wait. Please! Come back!

07:30.575 --> 07:32.743
I was a fool to think this would go well.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.121
Well, it's not so bad.
Your friends are here.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.706
We're gonna have a nice dinner.

07:37.498 --> 07:40.877
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm so sorry.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.129
Oh, baby doll, it's all right.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.382
We've all messed up and given away
the plot of something.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.341
Take it from me.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.344
"Fire" ain't the worst thing you can yell
in a theater.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.555
It's "Bruce Willis is dead!"

07:54.932 --> 07:58.352
I'm sorry, but there's been a problem.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.437
Spit it out!

07:59.520 --> 08:00.897
The refrigeration went out

08:00.980 --> 08:02.982
and the chicken and prime rib
were spoiled,

08:03.065 --> 08:05.151
and your ice cream birthday cake melted.

08:05.234 --> 08:08.196
And there's no food!

08:08.279 --> 08:09.655
Oh, no!

08:09.739 --> 08:12.408
We do have packets of cheese and crackers.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.411
Well, you can make a pretty good meal
out of cheese and crackers.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.372
Happy freakin' birthday to me.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.293
What a cool place for a secret clubhouse!

08:22.376 --> 08:26.297
I hope there are old textbooks up there
from when your parents were in school.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.549
I hope there are mannequins!

08:30.134 --> 08:32.887
-I'm not going first.
-You gotta go, Bobby,

08:32.970 --> 08:37.225
'cause if your deformed twin brother's up
there, he should see your face first.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.269
I guess you're right.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.156
You know, I was thinking, sug.
Maybe we could play a game.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.117
You know, get a tablecloth
and color some coasters with lipstick

08:55.201 --> 08:56.827
and play "Twister."

08:56.994 --> 08:58.079
Yeah, yeah. A game.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.457
Not Nancy's game, but how 'bout this?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.460
We'll pick a letter and whoever calls out
something they see

09:04.544 --> 09:06.587
that begins with that letter,
gets a point.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.839
Like say, if the letter was "A,"

09:08.923 --> 09:12.176
and you called out "I see an air vent,"
then you'd get a point.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.594
"A" is for alcohol.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.388
That's the only thing
gonna save this party.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.348
I demand a Tom Collins!

09:17.557 --> 09:18.849
Sorry, sir.

09:18.933 --> 09:22.103
We just entered Rumpert County.
It's a dry county.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.940
And, for election reasons,
it's long and horizontal,

09:26.023 --> 09:28.901
so it's gonna take us
about an hour to get through it.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.946
You'll have to wait 'till then
for an alcoholic beverage.

09:38.953 --> 09:42.206
I guess this is kinda cool. Isn't it?

09:42.290 --> 09:45.543
There's nothing up here
except old exercise equipment.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.754
This pink stuff is making my butt itch.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.258
Now it's making my hand itch.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.176
Now it's making everything itch.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.097
-Here, feel it.
-Ew. Don't touch us.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.892
Aunt Peggy and everybody,

10:01.976 --> 10:06.022
I feel really, really terrible about
spoiling the mystery.

10:06.105 --> 10:10.901
But then I remembered
I brought some friends along...

10:10.985 --> 10:13.237
the Manger Babies!

10:13.321 --> 10:14.989
No, dear God, no, not...

10:15.072 --> 10:16.198
The Manger Babies!

10:16.282 --> 10:18.492
Josea the Cat. Meow, meow.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.119
Obadiah the Donkey.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.412
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!

10:21.495 --> 10:23.956
Gurgle, Gurgle the Octopus.
Gurgle, gurgle.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.834
And Sir Reginald Feather bottom III.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.628
Pleasure to meet you. What, what.

10:28.711 --> 10:33.215
Hey, guys, there's an Andy Warhol wig
stuck in the back toilet.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.760
I tried to get it out
with Elton John sunglasses,

10:35.843 --> 10:38.554
but, you know, they got stuck, too.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.292
Oh, Peggy.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.002
Oh, Hank!

11:11.253 --> 11:18.177
I know you are trying so hard to make it
all right, but it's just not.

11:18.260 --> 11:21.931
My birthday is ruined. Again.

11:23.891 --> 11:28.771
I can't take this. They just left.
There's no cheese.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.565
And Hank, I want...

11:48.666 --> 11:50.000
Ah, beep-beep!

11:50.084 --> 11:51.210
Toot-toot.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.753
Ah, beep-beep!

11:52.837 --> 11:53.921
Toot-toot.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.381
Ah, beep-beep!

11:55.464 --> 11:56.590
Toot-toot.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.426
Ah, beep-beep!

11:58.551 --> 11:59.552
Toot-toot.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.095
Ah, beep-beep!

12:01.220 --> 12:02.179
Toot-toot.

12:02.263 --> 12:06.684
Did we just have relations
in a public place?

12:07.393 --> 12:11.230
Unless this is all a very weird dream,
yes, we did.

12:11.313 --> 12:15.317
-How do you feel?
-Uh, I feel great.

12:16.527 --> 12:20.656
Little does Dale know
this is the best birthday ever.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.368
Huh?

12:27.079 --> 12:30.291
Oh... happy feet.

12:33.377 --> 12:36.255
Guess what? We have our mystery.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.090
Oh, thank God.

12:39.884 --> 12:44.472
Somebody did the nasty on this train
and we're gonna find out who.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.649
There is no need to panic yet, Hank.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.318
It'll be a disaster

12:57.401 --> 13:00.279
if we get caught, Peggy. We're on a train.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.448
That means we are at this very moment

13:02.531 --> 13:06.452
under the jurisdiction
of the Texas Railroad Commission.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.953
Yes, so?

13:08.037 --> 13:11.415
The railroad commission
also regulates propane.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.043
If what we did in that bathroom
becomes public,

13:14.126 --> 13:16.796
Strickland Propane
could receive sanctions,

13:16.879 --> 13:19.632
maybe even the propane death penalty.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.679
Isn't this delicious?
I wonder who was naughty.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.890
Lucky is on the case.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.017
Now, that's usually what I say
when I drink beer,

13:30.100 --> 13:32.478
but this time, it refers to this mystery.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.022
I would not rule out sex-crazed hobos.

13:35.105 --> 13:39.151
-I wouldn't put it past a hobo.
-You are not helping, Hank.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.488
Attention, everyone.
I am Kahn Souphanousinphone.

13:42.571 --> 13:46.450
Upon entering the lavatory,
I observed two sets of footprints,

13:46.534 --> 13:49.787
one set pointing up and the other down...

13:49.870 --> 13:53.040
...evidence of love most foul.

13:53.123 --> 13:58.462
I discovered the deplorable act.
I will find the perpetrators.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.299
I will begin my questioning
with you, Dale Gribble.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.344
Has your wife been out of your sight
for even five minutes?

14:05.427 --> 14:08.055
No, she's been clingy all night.

14:08.138 --> 14:12.268
I can verify that Nancy has not been out
of Dale's sight at all.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.479
-I don't have an alibi.
-You're Bill Dauterive.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.565
That your alibi... airtight.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.444
Mm-mm.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.656
-What are you people up to?
-Oh, we just playing charades.

14:25.739 --> 14:28.701
You can stay and play if you want.
The category is "Book."

14:30.119 --> 14:32.788
Something went on here
and when I find out what it was,

14:32.872 --> 14:36.959
I'm gonna exercise my authority.
My full authority.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.754
His full authority, Peggy.

14:41.797 --> 14:45.885
Okay, back to business.
Lucky Kleinschmidt.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.928
It was you and Luanne, wasn't it?

14:48.012 --> 14:51.515
You trying to get in as much hanky-panky
as you can before she has her baby.

14:51.599 --> 14:56.228
Not that there's anything wrong
with your premise, but no, it wasn't us.

14:56.312 --> 15:00.441
We haven't done it in public since
Lucky almost fell off a Ferris wheel.

15:03.319 --> 15:07.323
-Kahn's going to get to us soon.
-Oh, God, we need an alibi.

15:07.406 --> 15:12.870
Okay, you lost a contact lens
in the food car and I helped you find it.

15:12.953 --> 15:16.248
Because your glasses are non-prescription.

15:18.959 --> 15:23.756
With all due respect, Inspector,
them footprints are still on the mirrors

15:23.839 --> 15:26.926
and that's where the great Quincy
would look first.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.138
Hey, you right, Scarecrow.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.807
Okay, everybody going to stick
their tootsies

15:33.891 --> 15:38.145
up to the mirror and we going to compare.
That's how we identify the fornicators.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.691
My feet are smoking guns.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.486
Well, maybe Boomhauer's date
has big feet, too.

15:45.569 --> 15:49.740
Hank, God would not make a girl deaf
and give her size 16 feet.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.200
We are sunk.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.501
I never knew meerkats were such jerks.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.002
What are we doing?

16:02.086 --> 16:04.713
We said we were going to make
a secret clubhouse

16:04.797 --> 16:06.674
and that's what we're going to do.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.425
Hey, wait, my dad says

16:08.509 --> 16:11.303
you've got a trapdoor
in your parents' closet.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.848
-He's been there lots of times.
-Oh, the crawlspace.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.643
Come on, guys. We're going down.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.481
John Redcorn, you first.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.028
This like dirty Cinderella.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.200
Okay, Redcorn, you off the hook. Next.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.759
We've got to do something.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.304
Create a diversion and I'll find
a way to destroy the evidence.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.225
The brake, that's it,
the Dead Man's Brake.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.121
-Peggy Hill, you're up.
-Oh, yeah, you're right, I am up.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.082
Unless P.J. or Bob or the waitress
want to go next.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.960
-After you, dearie.
-No, after you.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.587
I meant Peggy.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.760
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.359
What the hell happened?

17:49.443 --> 17:53.530
Some nut scared the tar out of me
and the train thought I was dead.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.865
It was him.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.910
That disco bastard.

18:12.716 --> 18:16.095
Aw, evidence gone. Now we'll never know.

18:17.596 --> 18:21.391
First, you people try to wreck my train.
Now you're having an orgy?

18:21.475 --> 18:23.727
Everybody off my train now.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.524
But you can't do that.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.359
Off now!

18:43.413 --> 18:45.833
By the looks of all
the abandoned farm machinery,

18:45.916 --> 18:48.043
we're stranded in Outer Durndle.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.212
It looks very tetanus-y.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.177
This is Peggy's worst birthday ever.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.597
I should feel on top of the world,
yet I'm not.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.559
I feel strangely hollow inside.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.105
Peggy, wait!

19:09.189 --> 19:12.025
Peggy... Peggy.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.112
I just wanted one nice birthday,

19:15.362 --> 19:17.823
but no, I can't even have one.

19:17.906 --> 19:22.995
Well, I finally get the message.
My birth is nothing to celebrate.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.497
-Well, it is to me.
-Me, too.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.999
Me, too, Aunt Peggy.

19:27.082 --> 19:30.002
-And me!
-You are special, sug.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.588
-And today is a special day.
-Oh, yeah?

19:32.671 --> 19:36.008
Then why does it always stink?

19:37.634 --> 19:41.305
-This not working.
-Maybe that the ticket.

19:45.058 --> 19:48.228
Alcohol. It's a neon sign from God.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.064
-My body wants a toddy.
-To the hooch.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.444
-Well, Peggy?
-Why not?

20:06.455 --> 20:07.664
Who wants a soda?

20:07.748 --> 20:08.957
-Me.
-Me.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.004
This is awesome.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.897
-Disco's back.
-I knew it.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.732
Well, all right.

20:35.442 --> 20:36.568
You all stay right there.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.239
I'm gonna go get my Technics turntable
and my 12-inch dance mixes.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.699
Miss Gloria Gaynor coming up.

20:53.877 --> 20:58.674
You really enjoyed yourself this evening.
Didn't you, Aunt Peggy?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.218
You know?

21:02.219 --> 21:06.014
Good for you. Happy birthday, Aunt Peggy.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.355
