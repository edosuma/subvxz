NARRATOR: <i>In the last episode</i>
<i>of</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.503 --> 00:06.631
The president of the United
States wants to visit the Hill.

00:06.715 --> 00:07.549
You didn't call.

00:07.632 --> 00:09.551
Five weeks in a hospital bed,
you didn't call.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.469
Belker came by every day,
even met a nurse.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.722
I figured if you wanted to talk,
you would've called me.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.224
I'm your police decorator, Frank.

00:16.307 --> 00:19.519
-Frank, this isn't my idea of progress.
-Progress?

00:19.602 --> 00:23.106
Relationships don't mature
on a diet of 20-minute lunches.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.316
If you have your little heart
set on waging war,

00:25.400 --> 00:26.568
you've got it, baby.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.571
He says the president
can't cross Gypsy Boy turf

00:29.654 --> 00:30.947
without a passport.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.786
<i>-(chattering)</i>
-ESTERHAUS:<i> Item eleven...</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:44.127
Item 11...

00:45.003 --> 00:48.339
regards security
for the president's visit.

00:48.423 --> 00:52.135
Now, we're shorthanded as it is,
so until further notice,

00:53.470 --> 00:57.557
all days off and vacations
are hereby canceled.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.268
(murmuring, chattering)

01:02.437 --> 01:04.147
ESTERHAUS: Before I get to the last item,

01:04.230 --> 01:06.566
I'd like to interject
a personal observation.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.154
It seems that we've reached
a new low, graffiti-wise,

01:11.237 --> 01:15.200
in both the men's and women's lavatories.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.327
(chattering)

01:17.410 --> 01:21.456
ESTERHAUS: Now, as an organization
of mature men and women,

01:21.539 --> 01:25.710
I suggest that we clean up our act,

01:25.794 --> 01:29.380
our vocabulary
and, at the very least, our spelling.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.467
(laughing)

01:32.550 --> 01:37.305
To the anonymous bathroom poet,
"breast" is generally spelled...

01:37.388 --> 01:40.225
B-R-E-A--

01:40.308 --> 01:43.394
-(laughing)
-S-T.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.396
(laughing continues)

01:50.026 --> 01:51.528
All right, last item.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.406
Belker's collar the other day
turned out not to be the rapists.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.617
-WOMAN: Oh, no.
-In spite of increased patrols

01:57.700 --> 01:59.577
in the area,
we had three more daylight attacks

01:59.661 --> 02:02.080
-over the last day and a half.
-WOMAN: What?

02:03.998 --> 02:07.418
Let's add Waverly and Clark,
Hill and Renko to the park.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.756
-I want this animal yesterday.
-MAN: Good luck.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.510
-ESTERHAUS: Let's roll.
-WOMAN: Boy.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.179
-MAN: Let's go.
-Let's be careful out there.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.474
-MAN: Let's go.
-(chattering)

02:23.643 --> 02:25.562
-MAN: Yeah.
-MAN 2: I got menthols. Let's hit it.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.148
(chattering continues)

02:35.780 --> 02:38.241
-(phone ringing)
-(cops speaking on radio)

02:38.324 --> 02:40.243
Hey, Sergeant. Sergeant.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.996
I know. I know. You want
to know about a new partner,

02:43.079 --> 02:45.874
and you want to know
about your transfer to plainclothes.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.002
-Catch me later, huh?
-(clearing throat) Sergeant,

02:49.085 --> 02:50.295
you gotta deal with this.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.505
It's not going away.
And it's not what you think.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.091
I give you my word:
I talk to the captain today.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.385
In the meantime,
I expect you both to go right on

02:57.468 --> 02:58.845
serving your fellow man.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.472
(sighs)

03:02.557 --> 03:05.101
Okay, cowboy, you heard the man.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.354
Stop that cowboy stuff.
I was born in New Jersey.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.690
I never been west of Chicago in my life.

03:11.482 --> 03:14.319
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:14.402 --> 03:16.029
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

03:16.112 --> 03:20.366
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:20.450 --> 03:23.536
(theme music playing)

04:28.685 --> 04:30.436
(water running)

04:36.150 --> 04:39.362
(banging)

04:44.158 --> 04:46.452
It's been a while, Frank. (clears throat)

04:46.536 --> 04:47.870
<i>Comment Ã§a va?</i>

04:47.954 --> 04:49.872
Hello, Howard.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.208
I thought I smelled
that tobacco blend of yours.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.253
What is that stuff?

04:55.336 --> 04:56.629
It's called Dutchman's Gold.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.048
My tobacconist imports it from Indonesia.

04:59.882 --> 05:00.800
Great aroma, Howard.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.885
You might start thinking
about Indonesia, Frank.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.721
Some little dugout up in the bamboo.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.306
If I were you, I'd consider it.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.058
(sighs) Why is that, Howard?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.811
Oh, Judas Priest.
Frank, you've got the Commander in Chief

05:11.894 --> 05:13.855
on the front burner,
and you're standing around here

05:13.938 --> 05:15.773
with your pants down
around your support hose.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.859
-Oh. So, the word's out, is it?
-The word?

05:17.942 --> 05:19.986
Hell, I know it. You know it.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.697
Every geek with a wild hair knows it.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.490
(Sighs)

05:24.574 --> 05:28.077
Doggone, I don't support
the man's gutless politics,

05:28.161 --> 05:30.496
but he is the chief executive.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.832
Security plans are
already in the works, Howard.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.709
I'm sure you'll be notified in due course.

05:34.792 --> 05:35.793
Ah.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.589
You're blowing brown smoke at me, Frank.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.514
What is the operational tableau?

05:48.598 --> 05:50.850
It's still tentative, Howard,

05:52.810 --> 05:56.147
but they'll most likely land the chopper
in the south end of St. James Park.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.524
From there, they'll proceed on foot
into the avenues.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.902
(chuckling)

06:00.985 --> 06:02.987
You know, it's a wonder they can
buckle their chin straps,

06:03.071 --> 06:05.031
much less run a government.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.825
Frank, a Steyr S.S.G.
hits from a thousand yards,

06:07.909 --> 06:10.078
-and they're common as dirt.
-I'm aware of that, Howard.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.454
Frank, look around here.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.207
You got your tenements,
both occupied and empty.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.375
You got your commercials.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.876
(both) Both occupied and empty.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.003
-Yes, I know.
-All well within that range.

06:19.087 --> 06:22.465
Judas Priest! You're inviting any misfit
with a sniper's mentality

06:22.548 --> 06:24.258
to take a whack at the chief executive.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.511
-Howard, could you just--
-Half the people in this precinct

06:26.594 --> 06:28.012
aren't even American citizens.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.265
They're illegal,
foreign perverts and malcontents.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.102
They don't even use our language.

06:34.185 --> 06:37.021
Howard, could you sum this up for me?
I'm running late.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.108
Give the order, Frank,
and I'll have the entire precinct

06:40.191 --> 06:42.318
evacuated in 18 hours.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.695
You won't find a cockroach
between here and the reservoir.

06:44.779 --> 06:49.200
Howard, the whole idea
is for the president to meet the public,

06:49.826 --> 06:51.744
review conditions up here himself,

06:52.286 --> 06:55.081
demonstrate his concern
for the disadvantaged.

06:55.164 --> 06:58.459
He can't do that, Howard,
if you evacuate the population.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.170
Folly, Frank. Pure and senseless folly.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.214
No, Howard, politics.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.007
Who knows?
Maybe some good will come of it.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.801
I do appreciate your input.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.931
(door opens, closes)

07:16.978 --> 07:19.480
-(phone ringing)
-MAN: Hill Street. Sergeant Becker.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.358
Hill Street. Sergeant Becker.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.158
Hey, we got a blaze going on
in the bathroom!

07:30.241 --> 07:32.201
(chattering)

07:32.285 --> 07:34.704
My sister and her husband
live in a brownstone

07:34.787 --> 07:36.664
he paid 200,000 bucks for.

07:37.331 --> 07:40.918
You oughta see it.
He's got his taste in his kidneys, man.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.380
But when I ask him to lend me
a lousy five grand at 12%,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.507
the nerd looks me
right in the eye and says,

07:46.591 --> 07:49.135
"Heh-heh-heh. John, you're family.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.053
But what can I do? I'm cash poor."

07:51.137 --> 07:53.681
Yeah, man. I can identify with that.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.934
The difference is,
my brother-in-law's got a half a million

07:57.018 --> 07:59.896
in rolling stock sitting in
the middle of his parking lot...

07:59.979 --> 08:02.523
that, and a seven-digit
credit line at the bank.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.319
All I know, man, is that
you gotta cut it loose,

08:06.402 --> 08:08.279
or you'll never get peaceful like me.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.907
-Take my cousin Spencer--
-Damn it, man, look at us.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.242
You're an ex-jock with one good knee.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.412
I'm a 34-year-old hot dog
living in a two-room efficiency.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.957
I got a closet full of clothes,
my car's financed up the wazoo,

08:20.041 --> 08:22.376
and I got a .38 strapped to my ankle.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.587
-Where's it at?
-Gee, man.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.839
You know, I was in a good mood
just two minutes ago?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.468
-LaRue: There he goes.
-Yeah.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.887
(upbeat instrumental music playing)

09:32.738 --> 09:34.532
MAN: You're on time for once.
I'm impressed.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.367
-(door closes)
-Man 2: Yeah.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.952
Come on, let's get it done, huh?

09:45.459 --> 09:47.837
-Seen enough?
-Yeah, let's do it.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.797
-Freeze! Police!
-Get up against that car!

09:49.880 --> 09:50.756
Hold it right there!

09:50.840 --> 09:53.509
WASHINGTON: Get back. Yeah, go ahead.
Go ahead. I got it.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.180
Okay. Turn around.
Turn around, chump! Spread them.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.933
-Easy.
-Easy, nothing.

10:56.989 --> 10:57.907
Freeze!

11:01.744 --> 11:03.204
Hey, come on. Come on!

11:04.997 --> 11:06.749
All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.876
-I'm undercover.
-Sure you are. All of us are.

11:08.959 --> 11:09.919
Check my back pocket.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.421
It's a regular undercover convention
down here.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.640
Macafee. Detective Sergeant.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.350
That's right.

11:26.435 --> 11:29.939
Out of Division. Congratulations, pal.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.274
You just screwed up an entire operation.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.110
No way, man.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.195
You save that one for the folks downtown.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.947
Put the bracelets on.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.951
-You wanna screw up some more?
-Put the bracelets on, Sergeant.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.996
Okay. You're an intelligent man.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.082
Ah.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.837
Here. Open it.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.214
Go on. You earned it.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.970
Fifty grand. Half is yours.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.931
If you're as intelligent
as I think you are.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.351
I think it's time
you learned the facts of life.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.521
There isn't a cop at Division
above the rank of sergeant

12:10.604 --> 12:13.149
who isn't into some very serious money.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.116
Okay, chief, in we go.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.037
Yeah.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.210
(sighs)

12:35.045 --> 12:37.381
I lost the sucker.
I got a good look at him though.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.134
-You read him his rights?
-Him?

12:40.217 --> 12:42.261
He read me his rights. (chuckles)

12:47.975 --> 12:50.478
-(engine starting)
-Hey, hey, man. It's cool, babe.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.313
We'll nail him next time out, okay?

12:53.105 --> 12:55.107
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.739
WASHINGTON: Okay, okay, let's move it.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.991
(indistinct)

13:04.074 --> 13:05.701
Okay. Okay. Take a seat, chief.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.953
I want a phone call.
I want my lawyer down here.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.706
-First we book, then you call. Sit down.
-My stomach's gone weird on me.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.293
I don't know...
I got some antacids downstairs. You mind?

13:14.376 --> 13:15.252
Uh-uh.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.006
-Do I look a little peaked to you?
-Always.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.258
-I'll be right back.
-Mm-hmm.

13:28.182 --> 13:31.352
-Hey, Farrelly, how's it going? All right.
-Fine. How you doing?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.589
(exhales)

14:06.887 --> 14:09.765
From what I know
of the president's itinerary,

14:09.849 --> 14:12.309
I don't think he's gonna
have time to visit buildings

14:12.393 --> 14:14.770
on Blood turf and Shamrock turf.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.647
Captain, Captain.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.567
Yeah, I kinda figured that you
were gonna say something like that,

14:19.650 --> 14:21.735
so let me just come
right to the point, okay?

14:22.319 --> 14:24.238
No tour, no treaty.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.116
You know, I got a deal with
the Catholic Urban Coalition.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.200
I don't have to be here.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.743
-You know what I mean?
-Who needs this?

14:29.827 --> 14:32.830
We didn't want to parley with you honkies
in the first place, you know?

14:32.913 --> 14:36.917
Gentlemen, please.
If we're all willing to bend a little--

14:37.001 --> 14:41.213
You said we were here
to negotiate a treaty.

14:41.297 --> 14:45.301
But all this white meat's trying to do
is suck canal water, man.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.429
The president is on a very tight schedule.

14:48.512 --> 14:52.725
Visiting two ghetto dwellings
would be a-a--a duplication of effort.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.269
Man's got a point, boys.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.771
You've seen one rat,
you've seen them all.

14:57.855 --> 14:58.856
Okay, look! Look!

15:01.609 --> 15:03.485
I cannot believe that there aren't...

15:04.069 --> 15:07.156
mutualities of interest
to be explored here.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.451
Uh, mutual--I'm sorry.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.745
Mutualities of interest,

15:12.828 --> 15:16.415
as, for instance,
in the Jefferson Avenue basketball court.

15:17.791 --> 15:21.587
-What about the court?
-Boundaries, dummy. Boundaries!

15:21.670 --> 15:23.923
The line between
the Blood and the Shamrock

15:24.006 --> 15:26.175
runs through midcourt.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.011
Yes, that's true. He's got a point.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.805
Uh, gentlemen, what I think
Mr. Abdul-Hassim

15:31.889 --> 15:33.432
is trying to explain...

15:33.515 --> 15:37.561
is that the boundary in question
prohibits full-court play, yes?

15:37.645 --> 15:42.566
Look, it's very simple.
You see, you give us full court,

15:42.650 --> 15:48.155
and we'll let the president
cross our turf to get to yours.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.240
See, but there's a problem
with full court.

15:50.324 --> 15:53.035
See, when you start bringing in,
like, that fried chicken.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.412
-Look, man, I've had enough of you!
-The radios.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.997
Look, I'm telling you, monkey...

15:59.667 --> 16:04.088
We get full court,
or you don't get no president, you dig?

16:05.297 --> 16:06.423
I think I dig.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.341
I'll tell you what.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.511
We're gonna give you
Mondays and Fridays for a month.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.513
A month! You gonna give us a month.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.722
Mickey, you know what?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.809
I think we just gonna have to
take that court off your hands.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.645
-You understand?
-How about--How about...

16:20.479 --> 16:21.480
one month,

16:22.523 --> 16:25.192
with an option for a second month?

16:29.947 --> 16:33.617
Okay. Okay, we'll go for the option.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.704
I'm gonna go for the option
because I got things to do today.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.789
I'll tell you what,

16:38.872 --> 16:43.419
one white death... one...
(whispering) it's over for you.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.672
Can you live with that?

16:50.759 --> 16:51.760
It'll do.

16:52.594 --> 16:53.595
-All right.
-Yeah.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.602
Tell your mama to meet me at 10:00, boy.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.812
BELKER: Come on, move!

17:05.607 --> 17:06.567
Belker.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.112
What, are you waiting
for an engraved invitation?

17:10.195 --> 17:11.822
You know where it is. Move!

17:15.409 --> 17:17.119
(phone ringing)

17:23.751 --> 17:25.502
WOMAN: Hill Street Station...

17:25.586 --> 17:29.757
You wanna sit down there,
or would you prefer internal injuries?

17:37.639 --> 17:38.724
Name.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.104
(dog growling, barking)

17:47.274 --> 17:48.901
(growling)

17:53.363 --> 17:57.242
-(growling continues)
-(whimpers)

18:01.955 --> 18:05.042
-Name.
-Carstairs, Roland P.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.753
(chuckles)

18:07.836 --> 18:10.798
Do you spell that
with a "C" or a "K," Roland?

18:10.881 --> 18:12.925
No, man, I spell it with a "Q."

18:13.008 --> 18:14.218
(chuckles)

18:16.261 --> 18:18.138
(phone ringing)

18:20.599 --> 18:22.392
Hill Street, Detective Belker.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.478
Hi, Ma.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.525
I'm, uh, booking a pickpocket.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.694
I'm listening.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.282
Ma, you're not having a heart attack,

18:37.366 --> 18:39.493
so why don't you just
give it to me straight?

18:43.413 --> 18:45.624
He's standing at the window
with binoculars.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.417
Why is that such a bad thing?

18:49.336 --> 18:51.296
So what if he's a Peeping Tom?

18:52.214 --> 18:53.882
So let him. The man is 83.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.634
All he's got left is his peep.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.180
Ma. Ma. Ma!

19:00.264 --> 19:03.016
I am not arresting
my own father, and that's that.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.269
-(laughing)
-End of conversation.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.273
Hold on for a second.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.069
(growling)

19:18.949 --> 19:20.450
That's better.

19:22.870 --> 19:23.829
What?

19:25.873 --> 19:27.082
Debbie Kaplan?

19:29.293 --> 19:31.503
Is that Ceil Kaplan's daughter, Ma?

19:33.213 --> 19:34.381
What did you do?

19:36.216 --> 19:38.677
No. I don't wanna meet her!

19:39.720 --> 19:41.889
I don't have time for dates.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.435
Okay, I'll call her. What's her number?

19:46.518 --> 19:50.230
Just give me her number.
Six, five, eight--

19:51.607 --> 19:54.234
Okay. Okay. I'll call her.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.487
I promise. Good-bye.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.789
(growling)

20:09.124 --> 20:10.459
MAN: Hill Street, Donovan.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.965
(typewriter clicking)

20:22.262 --> 20:24.556
Hey, come on. Toodle-oo.
Come on, toots, come on.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.271
Hey, you must be seriously
off your feed, lover.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.272
What?

20:32.814 --> 20:36.526
-You didn't even notice the trade.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's nice.

20:37.527 --> 20:38.987
Stomach still bothering you?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.407
Well, Dicostanzo's in the cage, and--

20:43.283 --> 20:46.119
Hey, you sure you're okay, babe?

20:46.203 --> 20:47.579
Hey, I said, yeah.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.167
You know, you're making
a serious mistake, man.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.712
That jive about your brother-in-law.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.256
You can't let it get to you.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.259
-(sighs) Yeah, I guess.
-You gotta forget it, man.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.760
You'll live longer.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.429
Soon as Dicostanzo's lawyer gets here,

21:04.513 --> 21:06.932
we'll commence us
some heavy-duty interrogating.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.642
And that oughta cheer you up.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.227
Thanks.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.274
CALLETANO: We're gonna need
the place for three days.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.109
The network guys will get the red passes.

21:17.192 --> 21:19.278
The newspapers
and radio people should have blue.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.612
We'll give yellow to the magazines.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.532
Why don't we just go
with our standard press permits?

21:23.615 --> 21:26.451
I think you're underestimating
the size of the press corps

21:26.535 --> 21:28.036
in a situation like this, Captain.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.831
Our people need to identify
exactly who's who,

21:30.914 --> 21:33.375
so we can control presidential access.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.502
Presidential access.

21:35.585 --> 21:38.213
-Hey, Frank, they want a boxing ring.
-Who?

21:38.297 --> 21:41.008
The youth club,
in return for giving the Secret Service

21:41.091 --> 21:42.968
their facilities for three days.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.387
-What's a boxing ring cost?
-I don't know.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.431
-You gonna give it to them?
-Phil, please.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.640
Well, I'm sorry, Francis.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.475
I can't help being dismayed
at this constant

21:50.559 --> 21:53.186
"give me, give me, give me" attitude.
It's extortionary.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.813
Excuse me.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.276
What's doing?

22:01.445 --> 22:03.488
-Do you wanna see me, J.D.?
-Uh, yeah.

22:04.364 --> 22:07.701
Uh, we nailed that dealer,
Sonny DiCostanzo.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.911
Way to go. Good collar.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.873
-Thanks.
-No problem with it, is there?

22:12.956 --> 22:16.335
No, no. Just wanted you to know.

22:16.793 --> 22:17.878
Okay.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.756
-Thanks.
-Right.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.105
Ah-ah.

22:37.898 --> 22:41.109
We're supposed to be on park detail.
Just call it in, and let's get outta here.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.153
Uh-uh. Looks like
there might be some trouble.

22:43.236 --> 22:47.074
-I'm gonna hit it.
-(siren blaring)

22:48.408 --> 22:50.285
(chattering)

22:52.871 --> 22:55.207
Okay, all right.
Break it up. Break it up. Back off.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.334
Back off. All right.

22:57.417 --> 23:00.003
Look at my car!
This fool piled right into me!

23:00.087 --> 23:02.672
-I'm backing out of my garage--
-Okay. Okay.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.424
(chattering, arguing)

23:04.508 --> 23:07.677
I'll put my fist upside
this stooge-ass, man.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.805
Hold on! Hold on!
Both of you. Hey, hold on!

23:09.888 --> 23:12.682
Hey, hold on! Both of you.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.143
(horn honking)

23:15.227 --> 23:16.311
Would you get over here?

23:21.733 --> 23:25.237
You both stay calm and cool,
or I'm gonna run you both in.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.863
-You got that?
-Yeah.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.366
-You understand?
-I didn't start nothing.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.245
Do you think you could fill out
the accident report

23:33.328 --> 23:35.539
while I run in their licenses?

23:36.123 --> 23:37.749
Accident report.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.418
You just do it.

23:40.168 --> 23:43.755
Accident report. You gotta
fill an accident report out in triplicate.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.424
-MAN: Damn.
-HILL: Okay, gentlemen.

23:45.507 --> 23:46.800
Let me have your licenses.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.718
MAN 2: This is nowhere, man.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.388
-You know this cat's got no insurance.
-MAN 3: Insurance?

23:51.471 --> 23:53.432
Look at the heap he's driving.
Insurance costs more

23:53.515 --> 23:55.642
-than the car is worth.
-I don't need no insurance, Jim.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.894
I ain't never had
an accident before in my life!

23:57.978 --> 24:00.063
Except for that one time
I clipped this dude's old lady

24:00.147 --> 24:02.858
crossing against the light,
but that wasn't my fault.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.443
All right. Who wants to start?

24:05.235 --> 24:07.529
-I'm coming out my garage--
-I was driving down the street.

24:07.612 --> 24:10.115
-This man's coming down the street--
-Going about 35 miles an hour.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.159
-(dispatcher, indistinct)
-(chattering, arguing)

24:12.242 --> 24:14.202
(shouting, indistinct)

24:14.286 --> 24:16.997
-Would you shut up?
-WOMAN: Did he say "shut up"?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.458
Now, how am I supposed
to fill out this report

24:19.541 --> 24:21.793
if you two are gonna stand there
yapping at me like this?

24:21.877 --> 24:23.962
-You just back off, Jim.
-Hey, whitey.

24:24.921 --> 24:26.965
Who you calling "Jim," Jim?

24:27.048 --> 24:29.426
-MAN 1: Uh-huh.
-MAN 2: Start walking.

24:29.509 --> 24:32.762
(chattering)

24:32.846 --> 24:36.224
You want an accident report,
you fill it out.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.810
-What the hell's the matter with you, man?
-I'll tell you something,

24:38.894 --> 24:40.896
they don't pay me enough
to deal with animals like this!

24:40.979 --> 24:43.857
The first thing they see is a white face,
and all they wanna do is do them in!

24:43.940 --> 24:45.442
You listen to me, Renko.

24:45.525 --> 24:48.737
It was a white finger
that pulled the trigger, not a black one!

24:48.820 --> 24:52.866
It was a white one!
I ain't gonna never forget that.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.367
And you better not either.

25:40.997 --> 25:44.251
(groaning, clearing throat)

25:46.503 --> 25:48.255
(clearing throat)

25:50.006 --> 25:53.802
-Hello, is, uh, Debbie there?
-WOMAN:<i> Speaking.</i>

25:53.885 --> 25:57.222
-Well, hi, this is Mick Belker.
<i>-Mick "Belcher"?</i>

25:58.056 --> 26:00.267
-Mick Belker, Rose Belker's son.
<i>-Oh.</i>

26:00.350 --> 26:02.185
Didn't your mother
warn you I'd be calling?

26:02.269 --> 26:03.478
<i>No.</i>

26:03.562 --> 26:05.605
(chuckling) Mothers.

26:06.439 --> 26:10.151
Well, I think your mom told my mom

26:10.235 --> 26:13.238
that you were expecting me
to call you for a date, so--

26:14.072 --> 26:15.490
No, I know you don't need a date.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.450
You probably got dates up the wazoo.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.496
Uh, I didn't mean it the way it sounded.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.039
That's just a police expression.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.166
Could you hold on
for just a minute, please?

26:35.427 --> 26:39.389
Hi. Uh, Debbie,
I know you're probably busy.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.183
<i>-No.</i>
-I'm just calling to get it over with.

26:43.727 --> 26:47.105
-You're not busy.
<i>-No. I'd like to meet you.</i>

26:47.188 --> 26:49.441
-Well, why do you want to do that?
<i>-Well, I don't know.</i>

26:49.524 --> 26:52.027
-This week?
<i>-Yeah. I'll pick you up.</i>

26:52.110 --> 26:53.111
Pick me up?

26:53.695 --> 26:57.532
-Well, I got my own car.
<i>-(Debbie, indistinct)</i>

26:57.616 --> 27:00.619
-No.
<i>-I can take a cab.</i>

27:00.702 --> 27:03.121
Uh, the neighborhood's a little hairy.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.707
A cab might not wanna come up here. Right.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.629
-I'm, uh, looking forward to it too.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

27:10.712 --> 27:11.630
Bye.

27:12.422 --> 27:16.926
Yes, we're coordinating security
for the president's walking tour.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.471
No, I'm not taking a cheap shot, Dave,

27:19.554 --> 27:22.307
but this precinct is operating
at less than full strength,

27:22.390 --> 27:26.144
we've got two fresh homicides,
and, boy, is this rotten.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.357
No. Sorry. Not you, Dave.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.234
A letter I just received. Look, uh--

27:33.318 --> 27:36.112
All I'm saying
is that with 11 men out with the flu,

27:36.196 --> 27:38.740
on top of everything else,
I got a real "blivit" on my hands.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.576
I... uh-huh.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.204
Yeah, yeah. We'll do the best we can.
Thanks, Commander.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.498
No dice. The only extra body
they're sending us

27:46.581 --> 27:49.042
is the police decorator... again!

27:49.125 --> 27:51.461
I don't understand
why Phil doesn't like her.

27:51.544 --> 27:53.004
She's a stunning woman.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.340
Fay Furillo, please.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.343
Ray, would you excuse me? Just a second.

27:58.426 --> 27:59.427
Sure.

28:00.428 --> 28:02.097
-Are you all right, Frank?
-Yeah, yeah.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.683
I just have to make a personal call.

28:07.227 --> 28:10.522
-FAY: <i>Hello?</i>
-Fay, this is really the lowest.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.817
What do you think,
I got a Swiss bank account

28:13.900 --> 28:15.694
with a million bucks
squirreled away or some--

28:15.777 --> 28:16.861
<i>I just talked to my lawyer.</i>

28:16.945 --> 28:18.780
Yeah? Well, let me tell you
something, Fay--

28:18.863 --> 28:21.700
-(line disconnects, dial tone)
-(sighs)

28:21.783 --> 28:22.867
(slams receiver)

28:26.746 --> 28:29.374
The letter...
Can they really do what he says?

28:29.457 --> 28:31.334
Garnish your wages, no.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.421
There are laws that protect you
from that sort of thing.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.339
Then what the hell is she trying to do?

28:37.090 --> 28:39.801
I think she's trying to bully you
into paying more child support.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.636
I'm broke. I don't have any more.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.556
Even if I did,
that kind of thing is blackmail, isn't it?

28:45.390 --> 28:47.600
There are two kinds of divorces, Frank.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.062
In one kind, the couple breaks up,

28:51.146 --> 28:54.441
splits the property,
works out the custody of the kids

28:54.524 --> 28:56.192
and goes their separate ways.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.695
In the other kind,
the two people break up,

28:58.778 --> 29:01.489
split the property,
work out the custody of the kids...

29:01.573 --> 29:03.908
and then continue to scratch
at all the problems

29:03.992 --> 29:05.744
that itched them in their marriage.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.580
The only difference is
they do it long distance

29:08.663 --> 29:09.914
between the lawyers.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.168
What kind of divorce do you have?

29:15.628 --> 29:16.504
What should I do?

29:18.840 --> 29:22.719
Well, you can respond
with a lawyer's letter of your own,

29:22.802 --> 29:25.764
but that will necessitate
a response from her lawyer,

29:25.847 --> 29:27.348
et cetera, et cetera, ad infinitum.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.142
And the only people
who will get your money

29:29.225 --> 29:30.518
will be the letter writers.

29:32.145 --> 29:34.814
Or the two of you
can sit down like two adults

29:34.898 --> 29:36.065
and review the situation.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.485
I'm extended to the limit as it is.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.822
Have you gotten a raise
in those two years?

29:42.906 --> 29:45.867
-Just cost of living.
-Has Fay?

29:48.620 --> 29:49.996
All right, I surrender.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.791
I'll talk to her.

29:52.874 --> 29:58.630
(sighs) Don't do it for me, Frank.
Do it for your son...

29:59.380 --> 30:00.465
and yourself.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.599
You'd have made a hell
of a marriage counselor, Counselor.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.564
Remember this bracelet?

30:17.941 --> 30:19.234
Hmm.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.820
We got it in that little antique shop.

30:21.903 --> 30:25.532
Mm-hmm. The first weekend
we ever spent together.

30:25.615 --> 30:26.491
Oh.

30:26.574 --> 30:29.452
(romantic piano music
playing in the background)

30:30.495 --> 30:33.832
Gold. It suits you, Davenport.

30:36.709 --> 30:37.961
I love you.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.172
And I love that bracelet.

30:42.006 --> 30:45.009
But it's not doing either of us
any good sitting on my wrist.

30:45.093 --> 30:48.805
Oh, no. No, no, no.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.767
I'd hock my watch
before I'd let you do that.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.936
Can I offer you a loan?

30:58.439 --> 31:00.024
Understand something, Joyce.

31:00.108 --> 31:03.111
If my son needed an operation
or something like that,

31:03.820 --> 31:05.864
I'd jump on your offer in a second.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.868
But you're right,
this is between Fay and me.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.661
And I don't want you in the middle.

31:17.584 --> 31:18.751
Can I see you tonight?

31:21.045 --> 31:24.257
Can you promise you won't run out on me
when that buzzer goes off?

31:24.340 --> 31:25.550
(sighs)

31:26.134 --> 31:29.053
I don't wanna promise something
I might not be able to deliver.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.180
Fair enough.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.933
Let me think about it and call you later?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.270
I love you, moneybags.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.690
What's not to love?

31:43.234 --> 31:46.237
Dispatch, I got an assault complaint.

31:46.779 --> 31:49.949
943 Beekman Avenue,

31:50.033 --> 31:52.327
apartment three, third floor.

31:52.410 --> 31:56.915
How about, uh, Hingle and Perez?

31:57.665 --> 31:59.334
No, forget that.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.670
Pull Hill and Renko off the park.

32:06.966 --> 32:09.928
(chattering)

32:10.011 --> 32:13.473
Corner room to the left, Officers.
He's beating her something awful!

32:13.556 --> 32:16.059
-(blows landing)
-(woman screaming)

32:16.142 --> 32:18.603
All right in there.
Open up the door. Police.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.271
He's crazy, man. He's got a gun!

32:20.355 --> 32:22.565
I said open up the door,
or I'm gonna kick it in!

32:22.649 --> 32:25.151
-Renko, the woman said he's got a gun.
-(screaming continues)

32:25.234 --> 32:26.945
Let's just call for some backups.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.657
-You scared?
-WOMAN (screaming): No! No!

32:32.909 --> 32:34.118
Kick it.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.121
Get outta here!

32:37.205 --> 32:39.958
-(screaming continues)
-Come on, man, kick it!

32:41.459 --> 32:42.627
(screaming) No! No!

32:43.878 --> 32:45.755
(screaming in Spanish)

32:50.468 --> 32:53.805
(instrumental action music playing)

32:54.764 --> 32:57.600
Call in a couple backups and the medics.
I'm going after him.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.613
(door opening)

33:58.911 --> 33:59.996
(door closing)

34:33.488 --> 34:34.530
(grunts)

35:00.306 --> 35:01.599
(creaks)

35:30.378 --> 35:33.047
Sorry. Don't shoot me, man.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.048
Bobby?

35:36.259 --> 35:37.927
(speaking Spanish)

35:46.811 --> 35:48.980
What you doing? You turn on the lights?

35:49.063 --> 35:51.983
-I thought you were gonna kill him, man.
-So he could dust me!

35:52.066 --> 35:53.401
He could've killed me, man!

35:53.484 --> 35:55.987
He could've killed me!
He could've killed me!

35:56.070 --> 35:58.072
He could've killed me!

35:59.031 --> 36:02.160
(grunting)

36:05.079 --> 36:07.665
(panting, whimpering)

36:09.083 --> 36:11.711
-(shouts)
-(nightstick clattering)

36:13.129 --> 36:15.673
(groaning)

36:24.432 --> 36:27.518
Frank, I have
a half a dozen calls here from Parker.

36:27.602 --> 36:30.313
You'd think we had nothing better to do
than hold that guy's hand.

36:30.396 --> 36:33.024
-Plus, your ex-wife called.
-Her I want.

36:33.107 --> 36:35.193
And you got a fire to put out over there.

36:39.071 --> 36:42.867
Yeah, I, uh, thought
we might get together tonight, talk.

36:43.492 --> 36:44.493
Tonight.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.955
Look, I get outta here about 7:00.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.082
Let's say we meet someplace in the open.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.794
Sally's Clam House?
Yeah, I know the place.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.339
Eight o'clock is cool.

36:57.590 --> 37:01.469
I got half a dozen report cards here
from civilians who seem to think

37:01.552 --> 37:04.055
you're a couple of outpatients
from County Psychiatric.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.806
What the hell's wrong with you?

37:06.515 --> 37:09.560
It's not working out, Captain.
You know how it goes sometimes.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.188
No, I don't, Renko. Educate me.

37:13.814 --> 37:15.274
I want to go into plainclothes.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.610
Esterhaus promised me
he'd talk to you about it.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.737
All right.
Let's run the request up to Division.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.739
You know you'll
have to leave the precinct.

37:23.532 --> 37:25.493
What about you? What's your problem?

37:25.576 --> 37:26.619
Him.

37:26.702 --> 37:29.747
Fine. Then it's solved. You're divorced.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.419
-Just like that?
-You got it, Hill. Just like that.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.849
I've seen this before.
Don't think you're the only ones.

37:50.142 --> 37:52.853
You walked in the wrong doorway
and got smacked.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.188
You both oughta be dead.

37:54.730 --> 37:57.525
Not because you screwed up,
and not because you're bad cops.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.236
You're not. As a matter of fact,
you're exceptionally good.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.405
But it happens.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.699
And if you survive,
it's never like it was.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.493
It's always with you. The "what ifs."

38:07.994 --> 38:09.578
"Which one of us failed?"

38:10.955 --> 38:14.000
And the shame, embarrassment,

38:14.917 --> 38:15.876
the anger.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.963
And most of all,
the fear of going back out there.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.257
Well, it doesn't faze me, Captain.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.926
That's bull. You were scared
outta your socks.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.469
Turning on that light switch.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.180
Who's telling who who's scared?

38:28.264 --> 38:31.726
Sure, I was. But I can admit it, Renko.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.186
-I've got no problem with that.
-Then admit it.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.938
You're swimming in it!

38:36.022 --> 38:38.274
All right.
So I'm nervous out there. Big deal.

38:38.357 --> 38:41.485
You just make me plainclothes,
and I'll get over that real fast!

38:41.569 --> 38:44.363
I told you I'd process the request, Renko,
and I will. Clear?

38:45.573 --> 38:46.490
Yes, sir.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.578
Meantime, I want you
to get your acts together individually,

38:50.661 --> 38:52.955
or neither one of you
has much of a future.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.623
How you do that is your business.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.834
But I won't tolerate
incompetence on the job,

38:56.917 --> 38:57.918
not for any reason.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.130
Until I hear otherwise,

39:01.213 --> 39:04.050
Phil will be finding you
separate duty assignments.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.307
(door closing)

39:11.390 --> 39:13.476
(dramatic music playing)

39:20.816 --> 39:21.776
(crying)

39:22.443 --> 39:24.487
Oh, man, don't start that.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.451
(sobbing)

39:33.704 --> 39:35.664
(crying) Would you stop it, man?

39:36.165 --> 39:37.708
Don't tell me what to do.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.629
(sniffs)

39:42.797 --> 39:44.882
You wouldn't last
more than ten minutes out there

39:44.965 --> 39:46.092
without me anyway.

39:46.634 --> 39:47.676
Oh, yeah?

39:47.760 --> 39:50.054
I haven't been doing too good
with you anyway.

39:52.723 --> 39:55.601
(chuckling, laughing)

40:00.106 --> 40:03.442
Ah. Oh, Jesus.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.488
We need each other, Bobby.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.161
I'm afraid we do, cowboy.

40:15.955 --> 40:16.956
Look, uh,

40:18.082 --> 40:20.668
why don't we just go get something to eat

40:20.751 --> 40:23.379
-and, uh, go back to work?
-Right.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.048
(sniffs) Yeah.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.177
Oh, God.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.474
(ice clattering)

40:35.558 --> 40:38.185
I've been thinking
about this thing nonstop.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.104
It's really messed up my head.

40:40.187 --> 40:41.188
Now, look...

40:41.939 --> 40:44.525
whatever you and your people are into,
that's your business.

40:44.608 --> 40:45.860
I don't want no part of it.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.157
I'm gonna give you the money back.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.873
(sighs)

40:59.748 --> 41:00.958
Detective LaRue.

41:02.084 --> 41:04.503
We're from Internal Affairs.
You're under arrest.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.840
Nothing turns my stomach
like a crooked cop.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.633
Yeah.

41:09.717 --> 41:10.968
All right!

41:12.928 --> 41:15.181
This the way you wanna
play it, huh, Macafee?

41:15.264 --> 41:16.307
Okay.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.309
Okay.

41:36.869 --> 41:40.122
-Feel better?
-(moans)

41:40.206 --> 41:42.666
I've always enjoyed a good soak.

41:44.877 --> 41:46.921
You know what you need, Furillo?

41:47.004 --> 41:50.966
-Hmm?
-A facial. How about it?

41:54.512 --> 41:55.763
Absolutely.

41:56.889 --> 41:59.433
I've needed one of those for years.
(chuckling)

41:59.517 --> 42:01.602
(chuckling)

42:01.685 --> 42:05.606
And then a prolonged body massage...

42:08.025 --> 42:09.777
with apricot lotion.

42:10.611 --> 42:14.990
I've always been
particularly fond of apricots, Counselor.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.825
Hmm.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.702
(beeping)

42:19.954 --> 42:21.539
(sighs)

42:23.791 --> 42:25.334
(beeping stops)

42:32.466 --> 42:34.009
Phil, Frank.

42:35.261 --> 42:40.975
Francis, I really feel terrible
disturbing you like this.

42:42.017 --> 42:45.187
(blowing bubbles)

42:45.271 --> 42:48.816
I feel terrible disturbing
you like this, Francis.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.777
-What's the problem, Phil?
<i>-It's Fay.</i>

42:52.945 --> 42:55.155
-What about Fay?
-She's been arrested.

42:55.739 --> 42:56.657
<i>What?</i>

42:57.241 --> 43:01.370
I had a call from a Detective Walsh
at the Polk Avenue Precinct.

43:01.453 --> 43:03.330
<i>She's raising hell down there,</i>

43:03.414 --> 43:07.668
<i>and I thought you might just want</i>
<i>to address the situation.</i>

43:07.751 --> 43:10.462
Oh, wonderfulness.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.634
-A murder?
-It might just come to that.

43:16.635 --> 43:20.097
Well, then let's hope for the best...
maybe manslaughter.

43:22.182 --> 43:24.351
Any chance of keeping that tub full?

43:27.521 --> 43:30.316
Before we got our respective divorces,

43:30.399 --> 43:31.900
I used to tell myself

43:31.984 --> 43:34.194
that the sight of you
pulling on your socks

43:34.278 --> 43:37.364
and rushing off into the night
didn't bother me.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.994
(sighs) I told myself that I understood.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.622
I thought that when the dust settled,

43:44.705 --> 43:49.668
there'd be more time for us
to, uh, explore each other,

43:49.752 --> 43:53.672
and maybe find out or figure out
if we were capable of something more

43:53.756 --> 43:56.675
than just an extramarital game
of bump and tickle.

44:00.429 --> 44:01.639
Maybe I can come back.

44:02.473 --> 44:06.018
(scoffs) Don't promise what you
can't deliver, Frank.

44:12.149 --> 44:13.275
Is this it?

44:13.901 --> 44:15.819
Is this the best we can hope for?

44:22.493 --> 44:24.119
It's a two-way street, kiddo.

44:25.371 --> 44:28.540
When was the last time you had more
than a couple of hours to spare?

44:28.624 --> 44:32.252
(romantic piano music playing)

44:41.178 --> 44:46.058
Detective Walsh, shield number 1974,

44:46.141 --> 44:48.894
indelibly burned into my brain.

44:48.977 --> 44:52.147
Your behind is gonna be in a sling,
mister, when my husband gets here.

44:52.231 --> 44:53.941
He's here, ma'am. You can go now.

44:54.024 --> 44:56.193
(sighs) Well, it's about time.

44:56.276 --> 44:58.028
(door creaks, closes)

44:58.112 --> 45:02.366
-Where the hell have you been?
-I just got the call from Phil Esterhaus.

45:02.449 --> 45:03.992
I don't have to ask where you've been.

45:04.076 --> 45:07.454
I was enjoying the air
in a friend's hot tub,

45:07.538 --> 45:08.956
thank you very much,

45:09.039 --> 45:12.418
when this S.S. man,
in a totally unwarranted raid,

45:12.501 --> 45:13.836
invaded our privacy!

45:13.919 --> 45:16.338
I think at the very least
what we're looking at here

45:16.422 --> 45:19.299
-is false arrest, police brutality.
-Fay, please, let's just go.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.552
We were investigating
a neighbor's complaint, sir.

45:21.635 --> 45:23.762
Frank, have you ever been
subjected to a cavity search?

45:23.846 --> 45:26.682
A quantity of marijuana
was seized on the scene, sir.

45:26.765 --> 45:30.602
-Well, it wasn't mine! I don't use drugs!
-Fay, let's go.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.271
-(sighs)
-Captain, I'm sorry.

45:32.354 --> 45:33.522
We didn't know who she was.

45:33.605 --> 45:36.942
Well, why don't you
ask next time, you bozo!

45:37.025 --> 45:38.026
Fay, shut up!

45:43.198 --> 45:44.324
Thank you, Walsh.

45:44.908 --> 45:47.494
Don't worry, you were just doing your job.

45:52.750 --> 45:57.588
Never. Never in my whole life
have I ever been treated like that!

45:57.671 --> 46:00.841
I am gonna sue
this department's cheeks off!

46:00.924 --> 46:02.760
How dare they!

46:02.843 --> 46:05.971
Who do they think I am,
just some sort of a common...

46:06.054 --> 46:08.515
(crying) I was so scared.

46:09.224 --> 46:11.393
I know. I know. It's okay.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.980
What were you doing there anyway?

46:15.814 --> 46:17.608
I told you.

46:18.817 --> 46:21.987
You were all in there... naked?

46:22.070 --> 46:24.239
No, I was wearing a wet suit.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.158
Of course, we were naked.

46:29.953 --> 46:31.038
Who were they?

46:31.830 --> 46:33.207
Friends of Harvey's.

46:33.791 --> 46:37.586
Where was... What's his name... Harvey?

46:37.669 --> 46:40.339
At a psychiatric convention in California.

46:41.507 --> 46:44.259
He's very conservative
about things like this, Frank.

46:44.343 --> 46:47.179
-When he finds out...
-He doesn't have to find out.

46:47.262 --> 46:50.307
-I was booked.
-You can be unbooked.

46:52.184 --> 46:53.435
I can?

46:54.436 --> 46:57.356
-First, we have to talk.
-About what?

46:57.439 --> 47:01.026
-The letter from the lawyer.
-That's blackmail.

47:01.109 --> 47:04.279
No one's trying to blackmail anyone.

47:04.363 --> 47:06.031
I just want to talk.

47:06.740 --> 47:08.158
You and me.

47:08.784 --> 47:11.203
Fay, we're adults.

47:12.913 --> 47:15.040
We once loved each other very much.

47:16.750 --> 47:19.253
We still share a love for our son.

47:21.004 --> 47:23.924
There's no reason we should
beat each other up with threats.

47:24.800 --> 47:30.097
For once since the divorce,
I just want to sit down and talk,

47:30.639 --> 47:32.432
work out something we can both live with.

47:32.516 --> 47:33.725
What do you say?

47:38.689 --> 47:39.606
Okay.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.150
I'd like that, Frank.

47:44.194 --> 47:45.696
Come on. I'll drive you home.

47:50.784 --> 47:52.828
Are you sure I won't be charged?

47:52.911 --> 47:54.788
It's already taken care of.

47:57.249 --> 47:59.626
You know, you're really not so bad, Frank.

48:02.462 --> 48:04.464
Oh, God. What a night.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.428
How many friends of yours
were in that hot tub?

48:10.345 --> 48:13.599
-What are you, an accountant?
-I'm concerned, that's all.

48:15.017 --> 48:16.351
In spite of everything,

48:17.811 --> 48:19.187
I still care about you.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.231
You do, huh?

48:26.028 --> 48:27.195
You know,

48:28.739 --> 48:31.033
I had an erotic dream
about you the other night.

48:32.492 --> 48:34.119
Do you ever dream about me?

48:36.997 --> 48:38.624
I've been known to.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.962
(engine starting)

48:56.266 --> 48:58.435
(music plays)
