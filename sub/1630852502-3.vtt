00:01.063 --> 00:04.498
My university might never release
my medical school transcripts.

00:04.523 --> 00:06.498
But sir, I am the doctor
I told you I was.

00:06.523 --> 00:09.098
I'm here about your former
colleague, Khaled Abdullah.

00:09.123 --> 00:11.624
Mr. Abdullah is wanted for
an immigration violation.

00:11.649 --> 00:13.639
So if you see him, call me.

00:38.048 --> 00:39.743
Bashir. Bashir.

00:40.393 --> 00:41.725
Khaled.

00:42.606 --> 00:44.439
Everything alright?

00:45.454 --> 00:47.344
I have these for you.

00:51.897 --> 00:53.496
Transcripts?

00:56.091 --> 00:58.091
I thought you were just
going to look into them.

00:58.116 --> 01:00.074
My friend said they
were easy to reproduce.

01:00.099 --> 01:02.480
So I told him just go ahead.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.071
Forgeries, corruption. That
was supposed to be behind us.

01:07.096 --> 01:09.115
These are your grades, brother.

01:09.140 --> 01:10.711
You earned them.

01:10.890 --> 01:13.133
Who cares where the paper comes from.

01:14.025 --> 01:15.911
Did you pay him for these?

01:25.558 --> 01:28.243
Yeah, they were asking about
you at the hospital as well

01:28.613 --> 01:31.461
- Did you tell them where I was?
- Of course not.

01:34.578 --> 01:37.094
My claim for asylum was denied.

01:37.119 --> 01:38.930
Can you appeal? What
if you got a lawyer?

01:49.125 --> 01:52.364
Can I stay with you just 'til
I figure out what to do?

01:55.120 --> 01:57.344
If it was just me, it
would be different.

01:57.541 --> 02:01.497
But I have Amira to consider,
and if we were caught...

02:02.636 --> 02:04.334
I understand.

02:09.911 --> 02:11.673
I'm working overnight.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.098
Amira's with a neighbour.

02:13.319 --> 02:15.351
Thank you. I'll leave at dawn.

02:15.376 --> 02:17.360
Your sister will never know I was there.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.612
And use the transcripts, Bashir.

02:19.822 --> 02:21.852
Nobody needs to know.

02:38.862 --> 02:41.907
Intra-nasal foreign body removal.

02:42.056 --> 02:45.048
- Interesting new hobby.
- Yeah. Jealous?

02:45.073 --> 02:47.073
I'm almost done if you
want to borrow it.

02:47.098 --> 02:49.290
Uh, no time, I'm headed
home for the night.

02:49.315 --> 02:52.397
Ugh. Eight hours of driving
for one day at home.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.032
Huh, somebody's hard up...

02:54.057 --> 02:56.231
It's Abby's piano recital tomorrow.

02:56.256 --> 02:59.104
And Melissa lets the girls sleep
in our bed when I'm gone,

02:59.129 --> 03:01.586
so that won't be happening.

03:02.124 --> 03:04.476
- Worth it to be with your family.
- Yeah.

03:04.713 --> 03:06.548
Amira, she spending the night solo?

03:06.573 --> 03:08.047
Amira? Girlfriend? Daughter?

03:08.072 --> 03:10.930
My younger sister. She's
with the neighbours.

03:13.641 --> 03:15.652
Dr. Hamed, by any chance,
do you speak Urdu?

03:15.677 --> 03:18.020
No. But I think my
great-grandmother did.

03:18.045 --> 03:19.610
Call the translator.

03:19.635 --> 03:21.454
Do you see non-surgical patients too?

03:21.479 --> 03:22.922
Only when it's busy, which is always,

03:22.947 --> 03:24.946
unless my surgical attending
needs me upstairs.

03:24.971 --> 03:26.961
Imagine they paid us by the patient?

03:27.066 --> 03:29.157
What is the pay schedule here?

03:29.182 --> 03:31.127
- Every third Thursday.
- When I first started,

03:31.152 --> 03:33.032
it took 'em four weeks to
get me on the payroll.

03:33.057 --> 03:34.680
Any chance they've gotten faster?

03:34.705 --> 03:36.563
Do you guys know a doctor?

03:36.572 --> 03:38.392
Dr. Hamed will take you to triage.

03:38.417 --> 03:41.848
Actually Dr. Curtis will. Dr.
Hamed and I need a word.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.438
Legal's up in arms about
your missing transcripts.

03:46.463 --> 03:49.024
They won't accept that you can't
get the originals out of Aleppo.

03:49.049 --> 03:51.528
Any chance they watched the
news in the past five years?

03:51.553 --> 03:52.743
Apparently not.

03:52.768 --> 03:55.181
They want to see you
before making a decision.

03:55.206 --> 03:56.985
- A decision?
- Render judgment?

03:57.010 --> 03:59.646
Call it what you will. They've
asked to talk to you tomorrow.

03:59.671 --> 04:01.825
Anything in particular
they want to know?

04:01.850 --> 04:03.276
About the Syrian doctor

04:03.301 --> 04:05.463
who showed up out of nowhere
wielding a power drill.

04:05.488 --> 04:07.373
I think they're gonna
want to know everything.

04:07.951 --> 04:10.863
To them, you're just a giant
flashing neon sign that reads:

04:10.888 --> 04:13.137
Liability. Do not proceed.

04:13.514 --> 04:15.181
Tomorrow, 6pm,

04:15.206 --> 04:17.238
and wear the kind of tie you wear

04:17.262 --> 04:19.176
when your entire future
hangs in the balance.

04:19.201 --> 04:20.834
Heading home, Dr. Bishop?

04:20.858 --> 04:22.503
Well, I can always stick around...

04:22.528 --> 04:23.762
Oh, no we're fine.

04:23.787 --> 04:25.136
You've been here all day.

04:25.339 --> 04:28.560
Wendy loves it when I insert
myself and disrupt her shifts.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.527
I still remember when 36-hour
shifts were the expectation.

04:31.552 --> 04:32.591
That's how I trained.

04:32.616 --> 04:35.480
Turns out we function
better when we're awake.

04:35.505 --> 04:37.902
Well, have fun tonight, people.

04:39.984 --> 04:42.886
What happened with the
Blakemore can't happen again.

04:43.026 --> 04:45.537
I'm aware you have
skills and experience,

04:45.562 --> 04:47.176
but in order for us to move forward,

04:47.201 --> 04:50.505
I need to be convinced that
you understand our protocols.

04:50.530 --> 04:51.903
You don't want me seeing patients?

04:51.928 --> 04:54.029
Only the basics. Anything
beyond that, I'm looped in.

04:54.054 --> 04:55.107
Understood?

04:55.132 --> 04:57.654
Cardiac arrest, pulling in now.

04:58.939 --> 05:00.773
Cardiac arrest aren't the basics?

05:00.798 --> 05:02.546
A kid with a fever is.

05:12.549 --> 05:14.733
How long has Tristan been sick?

05:14.758 --> 05:16.715
Well, he had the flu for a couple days,

05:16.740 --> 05:19.443
but tonight things just got way worse.

05:19.468 --> 05:20.468
What happened?

05:20.493 --> 05:22.207
He wouldn't drink the
juice that I got him,

05:22.232 --> 05:24.324
and then he just stopped answering me

05:24.499 --> 05:27.703
even though his eyes were open.
So I-I don't know.

05:30.310 --> 05:31.876
Are your parents around?

05:31.901 --> 05:34.461
Um yeah, my dad, my dad is working.

05:34.486 --> 05:36.332
I called him, but he
didn't answer, so...

05:36.501 --> 05:39.465
Temp's 38. BP's 110 over 70.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.871
Let's get his fever
down and put a line in.

05:41.896 --> 05:44.804
IV, fluids, CVC, lytes, CRP.

05:47.752 --> 05:49.718
Tristan? Can you hear me?

05:50.988 --> 05:54.051
I gave him a bath to try and
cool him down, but he...

05:54.185 --> 05:55.637
You did all the right things.

05:55.662 --> 05:57.817
It's a good thing you brought him here.

05:57.854 --> 05:59.980
His veins are flat due to dehydration.

06:00.005 --> 06:02.112
It's gonna be tough getting an IV in.

06:02.470 --> 06:04.948
Don't worry, Claire's
an expert with IVs.

06:05.967 --> 06:07.869
You can hold his hand if you want.

06:07.894 --> 06:10.082
Yeah. Okay.

06:14.154 --> 06:18.295
Buddy? The doctors are gonna
help you feel better, okay?

06:19.085 --> 06:20.839
Got it.

06:22.626 --> 06:24.478
I'm going to call your father again,

06:24.503 --> 06:27.650
- get him to meet you down here.
- Okay.

06:28.915 --> 06:31.322
Alright, what do we got here?

06:33.135 --> 06:34.830
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.226
Nice. Yeah, we're gonna
have to stitch you up.

06:41.251 --> 06:43.696
We're also gonna need a serum
tox with an alcohol level.

06:43.721 --> 06:46.642
- Yup.
- We... We were not drinking

06:46.667 --> 06:50.025
That's why it reeks like beer in here.

06:53.094 --> 06:54.861
What's your name?

06:54.886 --> 06:56.486
Well, what's yours?

06:56.511 --> 06:59.212
Did you, did you wanna have
dinner with me sometime?

06:59.861 --> 07:01.634
His name is Brett.

07:01.659 --> 07:04.595
He got hit in the head
with a lacrosse stick.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.970
Alright, Brett, follow my finger.

07:06.995 --> 07:08.837
So you guys like to
play lacrosse at night?

07:08.862 --> 07:09.863
Open your mouth.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.689
No, it's actually pledge week, so we...

07:11.714 --> 07:14.618
Wait. Dude, that's not gonna
hurt my chances, right?

07:14.643 --> 07:16.673
Dude, dude, shut up. You took a vow!

07:16.698 --> 07:18.650
Uh, you took a head wound
to get into a frat?

07:18.675 --> 07:22.025
I'm already in. I just...
caught a backswing by accident.

07:22.300 --> 07:25.228
I definitely would've taken that
hit if it meant I'd get in.

07:25.253 --> 07:28.023
You geniuses do realize that even a
minor head wound can be dangerous,

07:28.048 --> 07:30.954
especially when combined
with drugs and or alcohol?

07:30.979 --> 07:33.259
I told you, we weren't drinking.

07:33.284 --> 07:35.580
We're a holistic frat.

07:35.605 --> 07:37.579
No booze. No drugs.

07:37.604 --> 07:40.470
We even meditate.

07:40.495 --> 07:43.798
Well, you seem very enlightened.
I'll be back.

07:45.602 --> 07:47.677
Oh, shit.

07:55.255 --> 07:56.783
Oh!

07:57.961 --> 08:00.017
Last night was fun.

08:01.487 --> 08:04.228
You gonna hold the door for me too?

08:07.031 --> 08:08.868
You're welcome.

08:12.005 --> 08:15.291
Hi. I'm Doctor Leblanc. What
seems to be the problem today?

08:15.316 --> 08:17.135
I don't know why I'm here.

08:17.309 --> 08:20.293
I'm not hurt, as far as I can tell.

08:20.951 --> 08:23.351
Okay, uh, what is the
last thing you remember?

08:23.376 --> 08:25.228
They told me a cab driver brought me in.

08:25.253 --> 08:28.468
But I remember where I
took the cab, or why.

08:28.731 --> 08:30.531
I don't even know my own name.

08:30.556 --> 08:34.091
And you don't have any ID on you?
Wallet, phone?

08:35.835 --> 08:38.269
I don't know the password to unlock it.

08:38.294 --> 08:40.994
What kind of person leaves
their house without a wallet?

08:41.100 --> 08:44.107
Okay. Um, look at my finger.

08:49.632 --> 08:51.763
Well, doesn't seem like
you've been drinking.

08:51.788 --> 08:54.450
In any other case, I'd take
a complete medical history,

08:54.475 --> 08:56.505
but obviously that's not an option.

08:56.653 --> 08:59.154
Do you have any idea why
this is happening to me?

08:59.280 --> 09:02.647
Uh, head trauma, even mild,
can cause memory loss,

09:02.672 --> 09:05.622
but your pupils aren't dilated,
so concussion's unlikely.

09:05.647 --> 09:09.132
Could be lifestyle related. A
substance you ingested, maybe

09:10.200 --> 09:12.303
Do you think you can help me?

09:12.708 --> 09:14.661
Yeah, well, we'll run some tests,

09:14.686 --> 09:16.384
and narrow down the diagnoses.

09:16.409 --> 09:19.143
If anything comes back
to you, you let us know.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.849
I wasn't home when they brought him in.

09:25.874 --> 09:27.863
Max was worried. He's a
great older brother,

09:27.888 --> 09:30.114
but sometimes he's a
little overprotective.

09:30.139 --> 09:31.513
What, I wasn't...

09:31.538 --> 09:33.438
Dad, you know he's really sick, right?

09:33.463 --> 09:36.787
Dr. Hamed, this is Jared Abott.

09:36.812 --> 09:38.622
He would like to take his son home.

09:38.647 --> 09:40.248
- Where's his fever?
- 39 now.

09:40.273 --> 09:41.287
That's up from before.

09:41.312 --> 09:43.028
Sir, taking him home is not a good idea.

09:43.053 --> 09:45.209
He's been unresponsive
and has a high fever.

09:45.234 --> 09:46.591
We need to give him antibiotics.

09:46.616 --> 09:48.386
How do we know the fever
isn't a reaction to

09:48.411 --> 09:50.007
something that you have given him here?

09:50.032 --> 09:51.708
- Dad, no, I...
- He had a fever before

09:51.733 --> 09:53.192
I took him in. That's why he's here.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.544
I don't want him taking
unnecessary drugs.

09:55.569 --> 09:57.073
Tristan doesn't react well to them.

09:57.098 --> 09:58.896
How would you know? You
never give him any.

09:58.921 --> 10:01.393
Sir, this could be more
than a simple flu.

10:01.653 --> 10:04.333
We don't know what's causing
your son's fever to spike.

10:04.358 --> 10:06.190
It could be a serious infection.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.029
- He's not vaccinated.
- Max!

10:10.054 --> 10:11.738
They have to know, Dad!

10:11.763 --> 10:14.763
- Is that true?
- Which vaccinations is he missing?

10:16.804 --> 10:18.286
All of them.

10:33.104 --> 10:38.325
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

10:40.986 --> 10:44.055
We must shift Tristan Abbot in
negative pressure isolation.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.783
Gloves, gowns, masks on
everyone, staff or family,

10:46.808 --> 10:48.641
until we know what he has.

10:48.666 --> 10:49.900
You're back?

10:49.925 --> 10:52.944
Unvaccinated child with
a mystery illness?

10:53.006 --> 10:55.642
More interesting than my flat screen.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.061
I know that look.

10:57.086 --> 10:59.267
She's already writing
a paper in her head.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.195
So, what's the case?

11:01.220 --> 11:02.330
Seemingly healthy male,

11:02.355 --> 11:05.056
no idea who he is and no
ability to retain new memories

11:05.081 --> 11:06.980
Think it could be
Transient Global Amnesia?

11:07.005 --> 11:10.000
- What about a concussion?
- No headache, dizziness, nausea.

11:10.025 --> 11:11.540
No evidence of a fall or head trauma.

11:11.565 --> 11:14.744
Order a tox screen and CT just to
rule out anything more serious.

11:14.769 --> 11:15.946
He's out for both right now.

11:15.971 --> 11:18.638
Usually with TGA, a patient
still knows their name.

11:18.663 --> 11:20.728
Well, studies show some
cases are more acute.

11:20.753 --> 11:23.557
Could even be brought on by stress.
So should I call neurology?

11:23.582 --> 11:25.831
No, they'll only come down
if the CT shows something.

11:25.856 --> 11:28.276
With TGA, we're told to just
wait until he remembers,

11:28.301 --> 11:29.901
or someone comes looking for him.

11:29.926 --> 11:32.169
The Abbott boy's fever is still holding.

11:32.194 --> 11:34.322
The father wants to know
when we're discharging him.

11:34.347 --> 11:35.580
Of course he does.

11:35.884 --> 11:37.783
Get set up for the lumbar puncture.

11:37.883 --> 11:40.118
With your permission, I'd like to do it.

11:41.106 --> 11:42.391
I will do it.

11:42.477 --> 11:46.290
Page me when you're ready.
Get to work, both of you.

11:48.822 --> 11:51.792
Most first year don't get to do
spinal on their third shift.

11:51.817 --> 11:54.564
I may be a first year here, but
this is not my third shift.

11:54.604 --> 11:56.004
Okay.

11:57.086 --> 11:59.469
Do you see a lot of
unvaccinated children?

11:59.494 --> 12:00.926
More than we should.

12:00.951 --> 12:03.197
People afraid of side
effects, primarily autism.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.195
That study was retracted.

12:05.220 --> 12:08.597
Yeah, and a tonne of misinformation
is taking its place.

12:08.622 --> 12:10.491
Are there antivaxxers in Syria?

12:11.071 --> 12:13.632
People there are desperate for vaccines.

12:13.657 --> 12:16.236
We fight to get them into the country.

12:19.581 --> 12:21.831
The spinal needles
you're giving Tristan...

12:21.856 --> 12:24.613
Explain to me why you have to do this.

12:25.079 --> 12:27.136
We need to rule out
life-threatening infections

12:27.161 --> 12:29.050
like meningitis or encephalitis.

12:29.075 --> 12:31.220
And the blood tests you've
already done can't do that?

12:31.245 --> 12:33.370
There's a limit to what
blood work can tell us.

12:33.395 --> 12:34.612
Is it going to hurt him?

12:34.637 --> 12:36.926
We'll freeze up the skin
to minimize any pain,

12:36.951 --> 12:38.862
and make sure it's over
as quickly as possible.

12:39.193 --> 12:42.138
Max got one vaccination
when he was a baby.

12:42.712 --> 12:44.381
It left him paralyzed for a week.

12:44.406 --> 12:45.941
Half his little face was frozen.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.667
Reactions like that are rare,
and almost never serious.

12:48.692 --> 12:50.226
Until they are.

12:50.251 --> 12:51.717
We were lucky that he bounced back.

12:51.742 --> 12:53.519
After that, we were done with it.

12:53.885 --> 12:55.984
The body builds its own immunity.

12:57.055 --> 12:59.821
Then neither of your
sons are vaccinated?

13:00.769 --> 13:03.011
Mr. Abbott. We only
want to help your son.

13:03.036 --> 13:06.078
We'll be as non-invasive
as we can moving forward.

13:07.384 --> 13:09.279
Their mother was a natural with this.

13:09.304 --> 13:13.502
Together, we got Max through
colds, flus, even measles.

13:13.842 --> 13:16.796
We lost her suddenly in a car accident.

13:18.537 --> 13:20.420
Tristan wouldn't even remember her.

13:20.445 --> 13:22.011
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:26.859 --> 13:28.886
Is everything ready, Dr. Hamed?

13:28.911 --> 13:31.816
- Mm-hm.
- I'll insert the spinal needle.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.430
Hello. I'm Dr. Leblanc.

13:54.455 --> 13:56.987
A taxi brought you in and you
couldn't remember who you are.

13:57.012 --> 13:59.019
And we've already met.

13:59.744 --> 14:02.551
How can I not remember a
single thing about myself?

14:02.786 --> 14:04.784
Well, we do know a few things.

14:04.809 --> 14:07.715
Your imaging and blood work aren't
showing any significant abnormalities.

14:07.740 --> 14:10.191
So we know you're basically healthy.

14:10.473 --> 14:12.300
There's no pill you can give me?

14:12.325 --> 14:14.881
Jar my brain into recalling some facts?

14:14.906 --> 14:16.237
I wish there was.

14:16.378 --> 14:17.911
Give me your arm.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.414
That's quite a scar.

14:22.336 --> 14:23.722
Huh.

14:23.747 --> 14:25.347
It's weird...

14:26.699 --> 14:29.744
A stranger putting your life
under the microscope this way.

14:30.290 --> 14:33.039
Well, how about we widen the field?

14:33.235 --> 14:36.535
- You can cross-examine mine.
- Are you serious?

14:37.417 --> 14:39.645
Okay. Um...

14:39.670 --> 14:42.173
Young doctor starting out?

14:43.054 --> 14:45.188
Entry level BMW,

14:45.328 --> 14:47.370
a tiny perfect condo

14:47.395 --> 14:48.661
and, uh...

14:48.686 --> 14:50.933
and a couple cats you
rescued from the shelter.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.409
Couple cats? Now I'm offended.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.361
I still live in my studio walk-up.

14:56.386 --> 14:58.164
Turn around for me please?

14:58.943 --> 15:01.139
You don't want to put down roots?

15:01.164 --> 15:03.297
I'd rather spend on experiences.

15:03.406 --> 15:05.698
Live while there's time.

15:07.967 --> 15:09.434
Toussez deux fois?

15:11.862 --> 15:13.789
Well, we just found
out you speak French.

15:14.476 --> 15:15.808
- I do?
- Yeah.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.127
You responded to my
request, en français.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.422
The only thing you need to know
about me is that I don't give up.

15:22.681 --> 15:24.632
And I love my car.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.876
Hey.

15:38.695 --> 15:40.148
So, uh...

15:40.173 --> 15:42.734
Couple more hours, then we
can release your friend.

15:43.939 --> 15:46.578
Is there anyone you can
call to wait with him?

15:46.603 --> 15:48.039
You could go home.

15:48.312 --> 15:50.680
No one even supposed to
know what we're doing,

15:50.705 --> 15:53.453
so if I leave then I'll never get in.

15:54.891 --> 15:56.977
Ethan.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.938
I mean, is it... is it really
worth demeaning yourself

15:59.963 --> 16:04.406
just to be accepted by a
collection of entitled assholes?

16:05.201 --> 16:08.047
I'm here on scholarship, and...

16:08.183 --> 16:10.359
half the alumni get the
kind of finance jobs

16:10.384 --> 16:12.514
I want after business school, so...

16:13.297 --> 16:15.433
Yeah. It is.

16:30.599 --> 16:33.912
Wow. You'll really take
any excuse, won't you?

16:34.064 --> 16:35.443
You're not happy to see me?

16:35.468 --> 16:38.402
You need to be able to trust your staff.

16:38.427 --> 16:41.505
I do. I only hire the best.

16:41.708 --> 16:44.394
Then why are you back here instead
of getting the rest you need?

16:44.419 --> 16:46.581
Sound of an empty house
is too loud for you?

16:48.192 --> 16:50.987
It's my department, Claire. I
can come and go as I please.

16:51.012 --> 16:53.315
But it's touching that
you worry about me.

16:53.789 --> 16:55.925
I'm too busy to worry about you.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.772
Can't decide?

17:03.392 --> 17:05.558
My dad says it's all chemicals.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.877
He may have a point about that.

17:08.782 --> 17:10.483
He's not happy with me.

17:10.770 --> 17:12.178
I know.

17:12.847 --> 17:16.077
But you did the right thing
by telling us about Tristan.

17:17.406 --> 17:19.140
You know, he...

17:19.165 --> 17:21.531
He talks about getting
me through measles...

17:22.347 --> 17:25.281
as if him and my mom were heroes.

17:26.577 --> 17:28.944
You know? But it wasn't
like that for me.

17:28.969 --> 17:30.335
At all.

17:30.487 --> 17:32.253
I never told them, but I...

17:32.278 --> 17:34.972
I was so afraid that I was gonna die.

17:36.259 --> 17:38.476
And, I don't know...

17:38.501 --> 17:40.769
You know, after my mom...

17:41.522 --> 17:43.939
it's just gotten even harder
to talk to him, so...

17:52.215 --> 17:54.532
I won't tell if you won't.

18:02.786 --> 18:05.550
Theo, I thought you
were with your family.

18:05.575 --> 18:07.284
Made it halfway home.

18:07.309 --> 18:10.933
Atwater wants all her
pediatric resources close by.

18:12.006 --> 18:15.074
Well, I guess she just doesn't trust me.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.665
You mind taking a listen to that?

18:20.536 --> 18:22.369
Onset of stridor, right?

18:22.570 --> 18:25.439
It's faint but it's definitely there.

18:26.462 --> 18:28.483
Open his mouth.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.212
- Whoa, that's...
- a pseudo-membrane.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.621
If it grows, it could
obstruct his airway.

18:41.646 --> 18:43.081
Diphtheria.

18:43.106 --> 18:45.572
- I didn't think that existed here.
- It shouldn't.

18:45.597 --> 18:47.878
There have been two or three
cases in the past decade,

18:47.903 --> 18:49.222
but it's extremely rare.

18:49.247 --> 18:50.769
- I've never seen it.
- I have.

18:50.794 --> 18:52.637
And even people with
immunity can be carriers

18:52.662 --> 18:54.308
We need to start treatment now.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.542
There's an antitoxin.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.554
Which we don't stock due to vaccines.

18:57.712 --> 18:59.889
I'll get someone from
Public Health on the phone

18:59.914 --> 19:01.481
but they'll have to mix a compound.

19:01.506 --> 19:03.931
It's unlikely we'll get anything
until tomorrow afternoon.

19:03.954 --> 19:05.104
Do we have that long?

19:05.129 --> 19:08.175
If the membrane is already forming,
his airway will be compromised.

19:08.253 --> 19:10.620
We'll watch him closely and
keep pushing antibiotics.

19:10.645 --> 19:13.386
'Til then, we just need to
keep him hydrated and on O2.

19:13.594 --> 19:15.300
We need to inform the father.

19:15.325 --> 19:17.761
He's put this whole ward at risk.

19:21.015 --> 19:22.573
Alright, field trip's over.

19:22.598 --> 19:24.683
If you vomit, come back. If
you're dizzy, come back.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.594
No alcohol, mm?

19:26.619 --> 19:28.119
And no sports.

19:28.562 --> 19:30.144
And you. Ethan.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.136
You think you can help
him stick to that?

19:32.880 --> 19:35.690
Ethan? You with me buddy?

19:36.403 --> 19:38.472
Ethan? Ethan?

19:38.497 --> 19:41.136
Ethan! You okay?

19:47.158 --> 19:49.417
What did he take, Brett?

19:51.430 --> 19:53.527
I need help over here!

19:55.858 --> 19:58.097
He doesn't have a pulse. We
have to get him to trauma.

19:58.122 --> 20:00.409
On three. One, two, three.

20:05.029 --> 20:08.878
- What did he take, Brett?
- I don't know, I swear!

20:10.223 --> 20:12.230
We have a cardiac arrest!

20:12.255 --> 20:15.729
Claire! Claire, call Atwater.
Get everyone to trauma!

20:15.754 --> 20:17.654
We need Atwater, and we need Leblanc.

20:19.649 --> 20:22.004
We did a tox screen but
only on the injured one.

20:22.029 --> 20:23.940
Let's get a line going. Push epi.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.898
Let me know when you've got a read.

20:25.923 --> 20:28.167
Come on...

20:29.126 --> 20:30.647
Pulse check.

20:31.553 --> 20:32.788
Mm-mm.

20:32.813 --> 20:35.031
He's in V-Fib, we need to defibrillate!

20:35.056 --> 20:36.989
Defib, 200 Jules.

20:37.099 --> 20:38.765
Brett, what did he take?!

20:38.790 --> 20:41.561
- Uh...
- Charging. Pads on.

20:42.189 --> 20:44.280
- Ready.
- Everyone clear!

20:48.864 --> 20:50.329
Resume compressions.

20:50.514 --> 20:53.749
- Brett, what'd he take?!
- It-It wasn't dangerous.

20:53.774 --> 20:54.796
One amp epi.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.607
Whatever it was, he did it
to impress you, alright?

20:57.632 --> 21:00.301
So if you don't tell us
now, Ethan is gonna die!

21:00.326 --> 21:03.507
Soy sauce. He drank soy sauce.

21:03.532 --> 21:05.124
We make all the new pledges do it.

21:05.149 --> 21:07.389
If they don't, they get
the lacrosse stick.

21:07.414 --> 21:09.796
Most people just drink a
few sips and take a whack,

21:09.821 --> 21:11.738
but Ethan drank the whole bottle.

21:11.763 --> 21:14.436
- Hypernatremia?
- Made worse by alcohol consumption.

21:14.461 --> 21:16.827
The sodium is pulling water
from his organs and his brain.

21:16.852 --> 21:18.552
You can fix him, right?

21:18.577 --> 21:21.124
Start an infusion of D5W.

21:27.988 --> 21:29.988
I'll take over compressions.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.124
Doctor Hamed?

21:46.803 --> 21:48.182
Bash.

21:53.281 --> 21:54.669
Rhythm?

21:54.920 --> 21:56.319
Asystole.

21:57.625 --> 22:01.488
Does anyone have any other suggestions
on how to save this patient?

22:03.175 --> 22:05.162
Time, Dr. Curtis.

22:05.917 --> 22:09.745
- Time of death, 4:17 AM.
- What?

22:17.413 --> 22:20.350
We can't save them if they
don't tell us what's wrong.

22:36.607 --> 22:38.144
You had a busy night?

22:38.169 --> 22:40.584
We made dinners for the whole week.

22:40.936 --> 22:43.470
Hey, can you use your
key, I forgot mine.

22:50.863 --> 22:55.232
Are we going to have to leave?
It says rent past due.

22:55.334 --> 22:57.834
No, no, this is not a big deal, Amira.

22:57.859 --> 22:59.825
What about Pavel's daughter Nadia?

22:59.850 --> 23:01.084
I could offer to babysit.

23:01.109 --> 23:04.146
I've done it before. If we
need money, I can help!

23:04.218 --> 23:06.716
Your job is going to school
and learning English.

23:06.847 --> 23:09.857
Okay? I'll go talk to Pavel right
now and sort it out. Okay?

23:09.882 --> 23:12.309
It's not... Here. Take this.

23:12.666 --> 23:14.561
Go.

23:32.849 --> 23:35.046
You could have just talked
to me directly, Pavel.

23:35.071 --> 23:36.482
Amira saw the notice.

23:36.507 --> 23:38.810
Landlord asks me, I ask you.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.419
I just need a little more time.

23:40.444 --> 23:42.638
Who was the stranger with your keys?

23:42.867 --> 23:45.740
Just a friend. I'm allowed
to have visitors.

23:45.765 --> 23:47.803
Visitors come when you're at home.

23:47.962 --> 23:49.805
Your lease is for two people.

23:50.366 --> 23:52.567
Look Bashir, you know I like you. Okay?

23:52.592 --> 23:54.497
I'm just trying to keep
you out of trouble.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.104
Okay. You'll have the rent tomorrow.

24:24.431 --> 24:26.813
My brother says it's okay,

24:26.838 --> 24:29.427
but if we have to leave, I
would not see you anymore.

24:29.763 --> 24:31.763
I would miss you.

24:34.547 --> 24:36.351
Everything okay in here?

24:36.376 --> 24:39.479
We're fine. You barely slept.

24:39.504 --> 24:43.240
I know. I have to go
back to the hospital.

24:43.496 --> 24:45.067
Are you ready to go?

24:45.562 --> 24:48.458
- Hi, Daneesha.
- Hi.

25:30.185 --> 25:32.740
We did everything we
could to save that boy.

25:34.430 --> 25:37.394
I just had to tell that kid's
parents their only son just died

25:37.419 --> 25:39.175
trying to get into a frat.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.706
Stupid, meaningless way to die.

25:43.731 --> 25:47.381
It doesn't make it any easier
when they die for a reason.

25:54.950 --> 25:58.508
For those of you just coming
on shift, let me reiterate.

25:58.533 --> 26:00.906
We have an active case of diphtheria

26:00.931 --> 26:03.146
in an unvaccinated child.

26:03.355 --> 26:05.508
If you work here, you're
already inoculated.

26:05.533 --> 26:08.275
If someone you know
isn't, they should be.

26:08.463 --> 26:12.016
We're running a vaccination clinic,
Rhoda will have the details.

26:12.041 --> 26:14.367
The child is being kept,
under strict isolation

26:14.392 --> 26:16.079
so make sure you follow procedure.

26:16.104 --> 26:18.641
If you have had direct
contact, see Claire

26:18.666 --> 26:22.435
for cultures and
prophylactic antibiotics.

26:22.460 --> 26:24.141
Dr. Hunter is primary,

26:24.166 --> 26:27.437
and Dr. Hamed, who has
actually treated this disease,

26:27.462 --> 26:30.594
is a good resource. Make
sure that we use him.

26:30.619 --> 26:32.547
- Yes?
- Mm-hmm.

26:32.572 --> 26:34.133
Alright. Dismissed.

26:34.588 --> 26:36.896
Legal in an hour, you ready?

26:51.579 --> 26:54.113
Hmm. What was that for?

26:54.429 --> 26:55.837
Nothing.

26:55.862 --> 26:57.666
You sure?

26:59.929 --> 27:01.829
My place later?

27:17.655 --> 27:22.107
Um, if Tristan's awake, could you
just tell him I'm right outside?

27:24.089 --> 27:27.881
I know it must be hard not
being able to help him, but...

27:28.584 --> 27:31.067
Your brother and your
father need you healthy.

27:35.472 --> 27:39.008
Is it true that he could die?

27:41.741 --> 27:45.543
I don't think my dad can
handle losing somebody else.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.702
We're doing everything we can to
make sure that doesn't happen.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.152
Mm?

28:04.592 --> 28:07.387
- The antitoxin's ready.
- What's next?!

28:07.412 --> 28:09.238
All you people have been doing

28:09.263 --> 28:12.423
is pumping him full of God knows
what, and it isn't helping.

28:12.448 --> 28:13.988
We've been keeping him on antibiotics,

28:14.013 --> 28:15.746
waiting for the right
medication to arrive.

28:15.771 --> 28:18.355
Now that it has, we're able
to target his infection.

28:19.703 --> 28:21.839
You're telling me this one will help?

28:21.864 --> 28:23.912
I'm asking you to trust us.

28:26.568 --> 28:28.750
What are you doing here?
You're not on tonight.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.470
I know how to figure
out who John Doe is.

28:30.495 --> 28:32.993
I figured out the scar on his
elbow was from a UCL replacement.

28:33.018 --> 28:35.222
The surgeon probably used a
tendon from a tissue bank.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.690
Anyway, the point is, only a
really skilled baseball player

28:37.715 --> 28:39.142
would ever get a surgery like that.

28:39.167 --> 28:40.939
And, you know, like a
pitcher with prospects.

28:40.964 --> 28:43.562
And we know he speaks French, so
according to the age of the scar

28:43.587 --> 28:45.853
he could've played AAA in some
affiliated minor league...

28:45.878 --> 28:47.864
Mags. Mags. Stop. He's gone.
He's discharged.

28:47.889 --> 28:48.909
He got his memory back?

28:48.934 --> 28:50.770
Yeah. A few hours after
you left this morning.

28:50.795 --> 28:52.060
Wow.

28:52.085 --> 28:54.233
Well. I guess that's good.

28:54.313 --> 28:57.247
I just, uh... was I right? Who is he?

28:57.272 --> 28:59.406
Uh, Brian something?

28:59.431 --> 29:02.611
He remembered his name, he called
his wife, she came to get him.

29:02.636 --> 29:04.032
That's all I know..

29:04.057 --> 29:05.228
Okay.

29:05.368 --> 29:08.193
Well I can stick around, looks like
you might need the help, so...

29:08.218 --> 29:09.681
It's your day off.

29:09.706 --> 29:12.961
Go do whatever it is you
do when you're not here.

29:21.462 --> 29:22.778
Do we have to lower the dosage?

29:22.803 --> 29:25.067
We'll slow the infusion
and desensitize him.

29:25.092 --> 29:26.903
And if that's not enough?

29:30.176 --> 29:32.559
What's going on? What's
happening to him?

29:32.584 --> 29:34.715
He's having an allergic
reaction to the medication.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.535
It's a side effect, but
one we can manage.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.481
You need to stop. Don't
give him any more.

29:38.506 --> 29:40.184
This is exactly what
I was worried about!

29:40.209 --> 29:42.360
Tristan is in very critical condition.

29:42.385 --> 29:45.130
His throat is closing. He can't
fight this off on his own.

29:45.155 --> 29:47.809
You said that you'd help him. All
you're doing is hurting him!

29:47.834 --> 29:49.090
You're the one who hurt him.

29:49.115 --> 29:50.581
By leaving him vulnerable to this.

29:50.606 --> 29:52.356
All I did was try to protect him!

29:52.381 --> 29:53.647
But you didn't!

29:53.958 --> 29:56.356
And if you stand in our way
now, Tristan is going to die,

29:56.381 --> 29:58.115
and it will be your fault.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.214
This place is a madhouse.

30:08.379 --> 30:10.742
I've been on the phone all day.

30:11.011 --> 30:13.063
Want to switch jobs for an hour?

30:15.836 --> 30:17.942
I spoke with Tristan's home daycare,

30:17.967 --> 30:20.098
Public Health notified his community.

30:20.123 --> 30:24.049
No one else the kid came into contact
with seems to be symptomatic.

30:25.932 --> 30:29.401
I heard you had a few choice
words with the father.

30:31.573 --> 30:33.073
I find that having an outlet

30:33.098 --> 30:36.460
helps keep the frustration
from boiling over.

30:37.013 --> 30:39.755
- What's yours?
- Boxing.

30:40.921 --> 30:43.035
Sometimes bourbon?

30:48.745 --> 30:50.307
You good?

30:54.685 --> 30:58.669
If someone with very few resources
needed a place to stay.

30:58.694 --> 31:00.527
Would you have advice for him too?

31:01.576 --> 31:03.112
It's not for me.

31:04.304 --> 31:05.538
Right.

31:06.014 --> 31:08.951
Um... Any other info to go on?

31:11.388 --> 31:13.932
The details aren't really mine to share.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.066
Does this person have a
history of violence?

31:16.091 --> 31:17.519
Substance abuse?

31:18.690 --> 31:20.056
Give it time.

31:20.081 --> 31:21.589
Any place I find on short notice

31:21.614 --> 31:23.757
is sure to turn him on to both.

31:28.291 --> 31:29.808
I have to get going.

31:29.833 --> 31:32.225
- I'll get back to you.
- Thank you.

31:34.730 --> 31:37.304
- Hey.
- Labs are back on the Abbott kid.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.254
- Which one.
- The older brother.

31:39.279 --> 31:42.527
They screened for diphtheria but
you ordered a broader panel?

31:49.854 --> 31:51.089
Max.

31:51.283 --> 31:53.558
You have antibodies that
your brother doesn't,

31:53.583 --> 31:55.707
but I think you already knew that.

31:57.008 --> 31:58.878
It's a gown for the quarantine room.

31:58.903 --> 32:00.620
If you want to be with
Tristan you can be,

32:00.645 --> 32:03.183
but your father's gonna figure it out.

32:04.471 --> 32:06.168
I know you think he's...

32:06.193 --> 32:08.302
stupid and ignorant.

32:09.164 --> 32:10.463
But he's not.

32:10.488 --> 32:13.766
He's just stubborn, and...

32:15.149 --> 32:17.269
he's lost without my mom.

32:18.424 --> 32:20.324
Tristan needs me, so...

32:20.349 --> 32:23.151
I'm gonna go in there and be with him.

32:23.384 --> 32:26.695
What are you talking about?
You are not going in there.

32:31.642 --> 32:33.390
I got vaccinated, Dad.

32:33.415 --> 32:35.323
Like, the day I turned 16.

32:35.497 --> 32:37.073
You and Mom decided for me.

32:37.098 --> 32:39.996
And I didn't agree with your
choice so I made my own.

32:40.021 --> 32:41.831
You hid this from me?

32:42.241 --> 32:43.777
I had to!

32:47.648 --> 32:49.426
You were wrong, Dad.

32:52.108 --> 32:54.765
Dr. Hamed? We need you in there, now.

32:56.056 --> 32:58.081
His airway's nearly blocked.

33:01.623 --> 33:03.398
Oh, God.

33:08.423 --> 33:10.444
His neck's too swollen. Bag him.

33:10.476 --> 33:13.229
- He needs a cric.
- Now. We can't wait for an OR.

33:13.254 --> 33:15.247
Tristan needs an operation immediately

33:15.271 --> 33:17.949
that will allow him to breathe
through a hole in his neck.

33:18.924 --> 33:22.245
- Dad.
- Please, save him.

33:22.270 --> 33:25.199
Okay. We'll come and get
you as soon as we're done.

33:25.931 --> 33:29.133
Go ahead. We work as a team, here.

33:33.798 --> 33:36.275
I can't feel any landmarks.
The neck is too swollen.

33:36.300 --> 33:39.184
Make a large vertical incision and
I'll talk you through the anatomy.

33:45.521 --> 33:47.035
Claire.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.832
Palpate through the tissue 'til
you feel the cric membrane.

33:49.857 --> 33:52.066
Careful, it'll be small
on a child his age.

33:56.496 --> 33:59.626
- I feel it.
- Make a horizontal stab incision.

34:04.619 --> 34:07.337
- I'm in.
- Sats are 75% and falling.

34:07.362 --> 34:08.775
Keep going, Dr. Hamed.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.860
Use your finger to confirm you're
in the trachea, then thread.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.993
- I'm feeling resistance.
- BP's crashing.

34:15.018 --> 34:17.337
- He's going to arrest.
- Stay focused.

34:17.362 --> 34:20.563
It's likely in the subcutaneous
tissues, don't force it.

34:20.589 --> 34:23.788
Use your finger to confirm
you're in the right place.

34:25.641 --> 34:28.985
- Bash. Tell me what you need.
- The bougie isn't threading.

34:30.637 --> 34:33.739
There it goes. Railroad the tube.

34:49.132 --> 34:52.925
Sats are climbing. He's stabilizing.

34:53.706 --> 34:56.607
Well done, everyone.

34:56.632 --> 34:58.724
I'll go tell his father.

35:13.994 --> 35:18.825
We understand that you completed
medical school in 2011.

35:18.850 --> 35:22.364
Then specialized as trauma surgeon
and emergency medicine doctor

35:22.645 --> 35:26.020
practicing at various state
and field hospitals in Syria,

35:26.045 --> 35:28.606
before moving onto a clinic

35:28.631 --> 35:30.747
in a refugee camp in Turkey.

35:31.417 --> 35:33.567
I thought I'd sit in.

35:33.592 --> 35:36.770
Oh, we were just discussing Dr.
Hamed's work history.

35:36.795 --> 35:40.770
Mm. He has more experience
than a few of our attendings.

35:42.530 --> 35:44.463
What happened after Turkey?

35:44.488 --> 35:47.497
- I came here.
- Without your original transcripts.

35:48.565 --> 35:51.379
I have documents proving my identity.

35:51.404 --> 35:53.003
But not your credentials.

35:53.135 --> 35:55.620
Without those, the hospital
assumes a serious risk.

35:55.645 --> 35:57.075
One we can't afford.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.544
How can we be sure
you're truly qualified?

36:05.259 --> 36:06.950
I suppose you can't.

36:07.076 --> 36:08.958
No actually you can.

36:08.983 --> 36:10.200
Because I hired him.

36:10.225 --> 36:12.528
I'm sitting here because of him.

36:12.946 --> 36:15.372
With respect Dr. Bishop,
that's not enough.

36:15.397 --> 36:17.698
I'm not diminishing anything
he did for you but...

36:17.723 --> 36:20.395
He just performed an
emergency cricothyrotomy

36:20.420 --> 36:23.028
on a kid who has a disease that...

36:23.299 --> 36:25.020
shouldn't even exist here.

36:25.045 --> 36:26.220
Even still.

36:26.245 --> 36:28.201
This is about us needing a paper trail

36:28.226 --> 36:30.334
that proves he is who he says he is.

36:30.524 --> 36:32.290
They targeted doctors.

36:33.761 --> 36:35.271
In Syria.

36:35.662 --> 36:37.772
Especially ones who smuggled vaccines

36:37.797 --> 36:39.654
into the country to try to prevent

36:39.679 --> 36:42.443
typhoid, dysentery, diphtheria.

36:43.902 --> 36:45.469
It's simple.

36:46.538 --> 36:50.435
The state controls the universities.
And I am an enemy of the State.

36:51.581 --> 36:54.365
There is no paper trail
because of who I am.

36:58.312 --> 37:00.177
Let's be clear.

37:00.833 --> 37:03.326
What you're saying is that you
can't get your transcripts

37:03.351 --> 37:06.420
because you're an enemy
of the state in Syria.

37:10.406 --> 37:13.147
You know that could expose us
to all kind of scrutiny that...

37:13.172 --> 37:14.380
No, no, hold on.

37:14.405 --> 37:17.450
That's not what we're saying.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.537
Dr. Hamed and I are going to
pause and think this through.

37:23.951 --> 37:27.130
Ty, we'll circle back to you soon. Yeah?

37:34.296 --> 37:37.873
You've opened up a real can of
worms with that confession of you.

37:37.898 --> 37:39.577
Well, it's the truth.

37:39.602 --> 37:41.937
Some truths are better left unsaid.

37:42.525 --> 37:45.347
Either way, both of us
are out on a limb now.

37:48.897 --> 37:51.197
Tristan's responding well to the cric.

37:51.222 --> 37:53.483
- Great job.
- You too.

37:53.749 --> 37:55.389
You're, uh, you're back tomorrow?

37:55.414 --> 37:57.442
Yeah, then I got two days off.

37:57.766 --> 38:00.779
I'm not on tomorrow, so
I'll take your shift.

38:00.804 --> 38:02.989
Go get an extra day with your family.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.991
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

38:05.344 --> 38:07.952
Thanks, man.

38:26.656 --> 38:28.182
He's stable now.

38:28.510 --> 38:30.911
We're going to continue a
modified treatment regimen,

38:30.936 --> 38:32.102
but he's going to recover.

38:34.087 --> 38:36.087
I almost lost him.

38:38.824 --> 38:40.524
But you didn't.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.989
Max is so mad at me.

38:45.613 --> 38:48.259
There's still time to fix that.

38:50.522 --> 38:52.456
And Max is a great kid.

38:52.481 --> 38:54.374
So you are doing something right.

39:02.202 --> 39:03.843
Hey.

39:07.522 --> 39:09.489
I never wanted to lie to you.

39:10.234 --> 39:13.144
I'm sorry I made you
feel like you had to.

39:20.696 --> 39:22.986
I love you, son.

39:42.115 --> 39:43.384
Hi!

39:43.409 --> 39:45.675
- I thought it was your day off.
- Yeah!

39:45.700 --> 39:48.344
Mm-hmm, yeah, it is, it is.
It's just, um...

39:48.369 --> 39:52.183
I just, I focus better in here, so...

39:52.969 --> 39:55.394
This might be the strangest
thing I've heard all day.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.053
Bye, Bash.

40:31.371 --> 40:33.640
My building super saw you.

40:38.014 --> 40:39.812
Is he going to tell anyone?

40:55.285 --> 40:58.332
You know, this isn't a
safe place for you anyway.

40:58.802 --> 41:00.201
I know.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.847
It's a shelter you can go to.

41:25.853 --> 41:28.194
That's all I can do right now.

41:31.456 --> 41:34.159
Maybe we shouldn't talk for a while.

41:40.712 --> 41:42.792
You're a good friend, Bashir.

42:02.127 --> 42:04.661
You said you've babysat before.

42:04.686 --> 42:06.775
I didn't ask you when.

After Mama and Papa had to send
me to live with the cousins

42:10.523 --> 42:12.704
we went to the camp in Turkey.

42:12.891 --> 42:15.242
There were many kids younger than me.

42:15.365 --> 42:19.454
Warda and I used to take turns
watching them all the time.

42:19.479 --> 42:21.373
You and Warda were close.

42:21.653 --> 42:23.792
You must miss her.

42:25.364 --> 42:30.126
You weren't there, so you wouldn't
have known about the babysitting.

42:33.925 --> 42:36.134
Now I do.

42:44.105 --> 42:46.181
Amira, we're okay.

42:48.131 --> 42:50.694
You'd tell me if we weren't?

42:51.762 --> 42:53.495
I promise.
