WEBVTT

00:03.759 --> 00:07.638
Max, I'm very proud of you.
You've made tremendous progress.

00:07.804 --> 00:09.389
You need to continue therapy...

00:09.556 --> 00:11.725
...but I just know
you'll do great out there.

00:11.892 --> 00:14.937
Owe it all to you, Dr. Kafka. Thanks.

00:25.656 --> 00:30.118
- I'm out.
- Excellent, Maxwell. I'm so pleased.

00:30.285 --> 00:33.539
<i>You're the only person who wrote
to me at Ravencroft, Dr. Octavius.</i>

00:33.705 --> 00:35.832
I've taken a special interest
in your case.

00:35.999 --> 00:38.710
An interest which should benefit
us both.

00:38.877 --> 00:43.215
Yeah. Love the idea
of double-teaming you-know-who.

00:43.382 --> 00:44.716
<i>Double-team?</i>

00:44.883 --> 00:48.428
Oh, surely, we can do better
than that.

00:49.388 --> 00:50.639
Busy tonight?

00:50.806 --> 00:54.601
Mr. H indicated we're available.

01:09.241 --> 01:12.911
<i>Do not approach walls or door
or tranquilizing gas will be released...</i>

01:13.078 --> 01:16.164
<i>...to immobilize
O'Hirn, comma, Alexander.</i>

01:16.331 --> 01:17.624
I know.

01:20.210 --> 01:23.380
<i>Do not approach walls or door
or air pressure will be activated...</i>

01:23.547 --> 01:26.216
<i>...to contain Marko, comma, Flint.</i>

01:26.383 --> 01:27.551
I know.

01:27.718 --> 01:31.013
A sandwich? This is a joke, right?

01:31.179 --> 01:34.558
Raw silicates only, Toomes.
I don't eat food no more.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.854
Just save room for dessert:

01:39.021 --> 01:42.065
Spider-Man, é la mode.

03:12.614 --> 03:15.450
<i>Do not approach walls or door--</i>

03:15.617 --> 03:18.704
Finally, she shuts up.

03:27.254 --> 03:29.923
Back in business.

03:41.685 --> 03:44.396
- Nice night.
- Yeah, for a walk.

04:05.667 --> 04:06.710
Tickles.

04:16.094 --> 04:18.971
And...now.

04:26.521 --> 04:29.274
Oh, Maxwell, my dear boy.

04:29.441 --> 04:32.277
Doc, I kind of prefer Electro.

04:32.444 --> 04:33.904
I understand completely.

04:34.070 --> 04:36.490
Now, if you would do the honors...

04:46.416 --> 04:48.543
Boys.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.884
Okay, Ox, Fancy Dan, with me.

04:56.051 --> 04:58.261
Montana, stick with
these mooks for now.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.847
Last boat off the island's that way.

05:11.817 --> 05:14.402
Gotta love these lazy
Saturday mornings.

05:14.569 --> 05:17.197
Or noons.

05:17.364 --> 05:19.074
Better get up.

05:21.243 --> 05:22.452
Yikes.

05:23.578 --> 05:27.249
This new alien suit
is quite the time-saver.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.544
I just need my web-shooters.

05:30.752 --> 05:34.548
It makes its own webs?
How sweet is that?

05:38.802 --> 05:40.846
How did I ever live without you?

05:41.012 --> 05:45.308
<i>Making this the third time the singer's
baby was found driving her car.</i>

05:45.475 --> 05:47.811
- Aunt May?
<i>- Now, repeating our top story--</i>

05:47.978 --> 05:51.273
Shouldn't you get ready for your night
on the town with Mrs. Watson?

05:51.439 --> 05:54.734
To be honest,
I'm feeling a touch peaked.

05:54.901 --> 05:56.278
Perhaps I'll stay in.

05:56.444 --> 05:58.738
But you've had these theater tickets
for months.

05:58.905 --> 06:01.700
Come on, you deserve to have
a little fun once in a while.

06:01.867 --> 06:04.870
Well, I suppose.

06:05.036 --> 06:07.289
Just have the time of your life, okay?

06:08.039 --> 06:12.669
<i>All escapees were originally arrested
following battles with Spider-Man.</i>

06:14.129 --> 06:16.047
Yo, bro.

06:17.924 --> 06:19.467
Hey, don't leave me hanging.

06:19.634 --> 06:22.137
- If only.
- You ticked or something?

06:22.304 --> 06:23.346
Are you serious?

06:23.513 --> 06:27.392
You take pictures of Spidey stealing
the alien instead of calling the cops...

06:27.559 --> 06:29.686
...and you wonder if I'm ticked?

06:29.895 --> 06:32.647
- Bro, I--
- Stow the "bros." That's done.

06:32.814 --> 06:37.152
I was over the whole Lizard thing.
But this is who you are, Pete: a user.

06:37.319 --> 06:38.737
You do what gets you ahead...

06:38.904 --> 06:41.740
...even if it hurts the people
you claim are your friends.

06:41.907 --> 06:44.409
What you need
is a taste of your own medicine.

06:44.576 --> 06:46.953
Have something you care about
taken away.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.957
Trouble is, I'm not sure
you actually care about anything.

07:00.133 --> 07:03.470
Oh, great. Perfect. Wonderful.

07:03.637 --> 07:05.931
I've lost my oldest friend.

07:06.097 --> 07:10.018
Well, who needs him?
I've got the cool, new suit.

07:10.185 --> 07:14.731
And a little something
to take my mind off my troubles.

07:18.735 --> 07:23.657
I hear St. John Devereaux
is just hilarious as Falstaff.

07:31.373 --> 07:33.875
Freeze, O'Hirn.

07:43.385 --> 07:45.512
It's that awful rhinoceros person.

07:56.189 --> 07:59.609
Rhino, I knew no prison
was wide enough to hold you.

07:59.776 --> 08:02.112
Wide enough. Yeah, funny.

08:03.738 --> 08:07.617
I knew they taught trades
in the slammer, but a sense of humor?

08:09.119 --> 08:11.997
I don't get the tingles
when the bad guy's in plain sight.

08:15.375 --> 08:19.295
Sorry, Spidey.
Was I supposed to wait my turn?

08:19.462 --> 08:21.715
You two are partners again?

08:21.881 --> 08:23.425
Us two?

08:23.591 --> 08:26.761
Afraid you ain't getting off
that easy, bug.

08:39.649 --> 08:44.070
Now, then, arachnid, any last words?

08:45.447 --> 08:46.698
--Comes to mind.

08:57.876 --> 09:00.879
Ladies, you may want to step aside.

09:01.046 --> 09:04.257
So you can attack that young man?
I think not.

09:04.424 --> 09:06.718
_May__
<i>- I'll</i> be fine, ma'am. Just get to safety.

09:06.885 --> 09:08.636
Plow through them.

09:08.845 --> 09:10.180
Show's starting.

09:12.223 --> 09:14.893
- You okay?
- I think so.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.229
Go! Through the theater.
Get as far away as you can.

09:18.396 --> 09:22.400
Yes, run along now, ladies.

09:22.567 --> 09:24.235
Pull.

09:36.456 --> 09:39.834
Sydney, I think
they're canceling tonight's show.

09:42.796 --> 09:47.258
- What's wrong?
- My arm hurts.

09:47.425 --> 09:48.426
May?

09:48.593 --> 09:49.844
Call an ambulance.

09:51.304 --> 09:52.764
Only six, huh?

09:52.931 --> 09:55.266
What? Lizard and Goblin
had Knicks tickets?

09:55.433 --> 09:57.769
Gotta get some altitude,
deal with them one at a--

10:01.439 --> 10:03.191
Let's start by grounding this bird.

10:04.150 --> 10:07.654
Fool, this dog's not too old
to learn your tricks.

10:07.821 --> 10:10.365
My tech is protected
by reinforced steel.

10:10.532 --> 10:14.869
In fact, none of your former methods
will work on us a second time.

10:15.036 --> 10:17.789
And the Yankees win the pennant.

10:23.294 --> 10:26.214
<i>I hate to admit it,
but I can't beat these guys together.</i>

10:26.422 --> 10:27.841
<i>Gotta bail.</i>

10:31.845 --> 10:33.763
Not again.

10:38.184 --> 10:42.021
I don't think I can fit.
And I don't do good in tunnels.

10:42.188 --> 10:46.192
Keep the police busy.
We'll handle the wet work.

10:46.359 --> 10:49.362
- How are we supposed to spot the bug?
- Maybe this will help.

10:51.990 --> 10:56.828
I'm pleased you've learned to conduct
your power safely through water...

10:56.995 --> 11:00.665
...but down here you present a danger
to the group. Head back up.

11:00.832 --> 11:03.334
- But the Spider-Freak--
- Maxwell...

11:03.501 --> 11:05.587
Yeah, doc. Okay.

11:05.753 --> 11:08.506
Hey, I'm turning to Mudman here.
Can I go too?

11:08.673 --> 11:11.342
- Amateurs.
- Who you calling an amateur?

11:16.514 --> 11:19.517
Nope, it's not Pete or Flash.

11:19.684 --> 11:23.354
Kenny? Of course not.
I'd never do that to you.

11:23.521 --> 11:28.318
A hint? Well, he is someone
I met at the formal.

11:28.484 --> 11:32.280
And here he is now. Gotta go.

11:36.201 --> 11:38.203
The whole thing's Spider-Man's fault.

11:38.369 --> 11:41.372
New York never saw supervillains
till the superhero showed up.

11:41.539 --> 11:43.708
- Where's Parker?
- Update from Times Square.

11:43.875 --> 11:46.211
Plenty of property damage,
no serious injuries.

11:46.377 --> 11:49.881
- One elderly woman had a heart attack.
- Well, give me a name, Robbie.

11:50.048 --> 11:52.884
- The people wanna know who to pity.
- May Parker.

11:53.718 --> 11:55.929
That's Peter's Aunt May.
I have to call him.

11:56.095 --> 11:59.307
No! No, I'll call Peter myself.

12:08.650 --> 12:11.152
<i>Jonah, calling to yell at me
for not getting pics...</i>

12:11.319 --> 12:13.488
...of <i>those bozos beating</i> me <i>up.</i>

12:13.655 --> 12:16.032
<i>That we don't need.</i>

12:18.660 --> 12:21.454
I'll set it for 9 p.m.

12:21.621 --> 12:25.250
Subway should get Aunt May home
by then. I wanna make sure she's okay.

12:25.416 --> 12:28.086
Now we really have to get that woman
a cell phone.

12:28.253 --> 12:32.590
Oh, man. I wish I could
just wake up tomorrow...

12:33.132 --> 12:37.095
...with doc and his merry morons
back in jail.

12:41.099 --> 12:43.810
<i>Oh, you have reached
the home of May...</i>

12:43.977 --> 12:45.645
<i>- And Peter.
-...Parker.</i>

12:45.812 --> 12:48.356
<i>Please leave a message
and we'll call back.</i>

12:48.564 --> 12:52.193
<i>Peter, it's Anna again. Please call.</i>

12:54.862 --> 12:56.030
What are they doing now?

12:56.197 --> 12:59.200
I think they're having dinner.

12:59.367 --> 13:02.453
To Spider-Man's ignominious defeat.

13:02.620 --> 13:07.500
Defeat? Seems to me
a job ain't done till it's done.

13:07.667 --> 13:11.004
I was topside.
You yahoos lost the creep.

13:11.170 --> 13:13.298
Next time, I smash him myself.

13:13.464 --> 13:17.468
What's with you and revenge?
All I ever wanted was a decent score.

13:17.635 --> 13:20.221
This obsession with Spider-Man
is a distraction.

13:20.388 --> 13:23.182
It's Osborn who's truly earned
my wrath.

13:23.349 --> 13:24.642
I'm calling Mr. H.

13:24.809 --> 13:27.020
See if he'll give the okay
to ditch you sorry--

13:27.186 --> 13:29.647
Stop. What are you doing?
I need a cure...

13:29.814 --> 13:33.484
...but the only way to get what we want
is to trust the doc.

13:33.651 --> 13:35.570
Thank you, Electro.

13:35.737 --> 13:40.241
Yes, gentlemen, and Rhino,
we're frustrated.

13:40.408 --> 13:42.410
But the arachnid will be crushed.

13:42.618 --> 13:44.746
How? He's long gone.

13:44.912 --> 13:47.498
We simply engineer a situation...

13:47.665 --> 13:50.835
...that forces Spider-Man to play
the hero.

13:51.002 --> 13:54.505
He'll come. He can't help himself.

13:54.672 --> 13:56.674
Check, please.

13:57.050 --> 14:00.053
- On the house, sir?
- How kind of you.

14:00.219 --> 14:01.637
And wise.

14:03.848 --> 14:06.184
<i>The escaped convicts have left
Times Square...</i>

14:06.351 --> 14:11.022
<i>...and have now taken hostages
at the Metro Bank near Central Park.</i>

14:16.027 --> 14:17.779
He's back, boys.

14:37.465 --> 14:39.801
Well, doc, you was right.

14:39.967 --> 14:43.930
Guess some folk
are just too dumb to live.

14:51.521 --> 14:54.023
Rhino, you won the coin toss.

14:54.190 --> 14:59.779
Will you crush his skull or
simply impale his heart on your horn?

14:59.946 --> 15:02.615
Impale. impale sounds good.

15:05.076 --> 15:09.872
What's the matter, web creep?
Too scared to crack a last joke?

15:14.752 --> 15:16.838
I'll finish him.

15:22.677 --> 15:24.762
Glad you came out tonight,
Mary Jane.

15:24.929 --> 15:26.722
But won't Pete be bummed?

15:26.889 --> 15:28.474
He knows we're not exclusive.

15:28.683 --> 15:31.436
Still, he was crushing pretty hard
at the dance.

15:31.602 --> 15:33.771
Well, what's the deal with you two?

15:33.938 --> 15:36.983
Same old story.
Two kids who grew up together.

15:37.191 --> 15:39.944
Our moms were best friends,
our dads were partners.

15:40.111 --> 15:41.779
They had a startup lab in Queens.

15:41.946 --> 15:44.449
Then the four of them went
to a conference together.

15:44.615 --> 15:47.326
And there was this funny
little plane crash.

15:47.493 --> 15:50.455
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

15:50.621 --> 15:53.332
Well, stuff happens.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.670
Hey, slow down, chief.

15:57.837 --> 15:59.839
I've always kind of
been his big brother.

16:00.006 --> 16:01.674
Kept the bullies off his back.

16:01.841 --> 16:04.218
So, in gratitude, Pete took pictures...

16:05.845 --> 16:07.555
...to profit off our bosses' pain.

16:11.267 --> 16:15.104
Okay, not fun anymore. Stop.
Stop. Stop right now.

16:15.271 --> 16:17.523
Don't you wanna know
how the story ends?

16:18.357 --> 16:21.194
Pete may not be perfect,
but whatever his faults...

16:21.360 --> 16:23.738
...he's twice the man you'll ever be.

16:32.330 --> 16:34.957
Morales, Wingard,
secure the hostages in the bank.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.792
Carter, DeWolff, with me.

16:53.017 --> 16:56.771
I'm gonna fry you for that, freak.

17:49.615 --> 17:51.075
That's it.

18:08.384 --> 18:09.760
- Oh, man.
- Dang it.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.097
Keep shooting.

18:17.977 --> 18:19.645
Move in, kid. I got you covered.

18:32.658 --> 18:34.660
Get him off.

18:41.917 --> 18:43.628
What the heck happened to O'Hirn?

18:43.794 --> 18:46.380
Sandman, help Electro.

18:47.923 --> 18:49.342
Get him off!

18:49.800 --> 18:52.261
I'm trying. Turn down the juice.

18:52.887 --> 18:55.723
Wait. He's trying to escape again.

19:00.186 --> 19:03.314
Vulture, move! I don't wanna take out
another of our own.

19:12.782 --> 19:15.368
Stop! I will not stand for--

19:27.797 --> 19:29.715
What the boot hill--?

19:38.140 --> 19:39.975
Why you--

19:52.571 --> 19:55.157
Dodge this!

20:01.247 --> 20:03.416
I knew you were finally
getting serious...

20:03.582 --> 20:06.752
...when you stopped cracking
your pathetic little jokes.

20:06.961 --> 20:10.381
Just as I knew you would expend
your energies fighting my allies...

20:10.548 --> 20:14.593
...leaving you open for Dr. Octopus
to deliver the coup de gréce.

20:14.760 --> 20:19.056
Now, I do believe we promised Rhino
an impalement.

20:19.223 --> 20:22.852
Get him off.

20:37.283 --> 20:39.285
Apologies, Rhino.

20:39.452 --> 20:42.246
We're doing this my way.

20:43.289 --> 20:46.208
Your new suit interests me, arachnid.

20:46.375 --> 20:52.173
I'm going to enjoy peeling it away
for further study.

21:01.515 --> 21:04.226
- He's gonna--
- Spider-Man, stop! It's over.

21:16.155 --> 21:18.991
Oh, man, the alarm didn't go off.

21:19.158 --> 21:22.620
I've been asleep for, oh, nine hours.

21:22.787 --> 21:24.580
So why am I still exhausted?

21:30.961 --> 21:34.757
<i>I don't remember taking
this much punishment in Times Square.</i>

21:34.924 --> 21:37.676
<i>Where did that one come from?</i>

21:42.264 --> 21:46.435
<i>After the day she had yesterday,
we'll let her sleep a bit longer.</i>

21:50.147 --> 21:54.485
<i>"Spidey Stops Sinister Six"?
"Photos by Peter Parker"?</i>

21:54.652 --> 21:56.529
<i>I don't remember any of this.</i>

21:56.695 --> 22:00.533
<i>It's like I slept through
the whole fight.</i>

22:00.699 --> 22:05.704
<i>This wasn't me wearing the suit.
This was the suit wearing my body.</i>

22:05.871 --> 22:10.292
<i>This alien,
it's some kind of symbiote.</i>

22:10.459 --> 22:14.547
<i>Still, what do we care?
The six were put down hard.</i>

22:14.713 --> 22:17.216
<i>Parker gets paid for the photos.
What else matters?</i>

22:17.383 --> 22:20.386
Pete. Where have you been?
Your aunt--

22:20.594 --> 22:23.180
She's still asleep upstairs.

22:23.347 --> 22:24.849
No, Peter.

22:25.015 --> 22:27.309
She had a heart attack last night.

22:27.476 --> 22:32.231
She should be okay,
but she's in the hospital.
