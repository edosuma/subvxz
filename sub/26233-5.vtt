00:42.292 --> 00:44.586
[sighs] Do you smell that clean air?

00:45.503 --> 00:46.838
I just smell manure.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.715
Oh, it's different up here.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.676
Good things happen
when you get out of the city.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.471
I get shot every time I leave New York.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.223
That's an exaggeration.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.517
Degas run in Cap-Ferrat? Shot.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.687
Gauguin ceramics in Marquesas? Shot.

01:02.771 --> 01:06.107
That time in Jackson Hole
with the wife? Also shot.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.861
-But Jackson Hole was our biggest score.
-Still counts.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.156
Hmm. I never noticed that pattern before.

01:23.583 --> 01:27.253
Bobby, pull over.
I think my mind is playing tricks.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.435
I know you ain't superstitious
like me, boss,

01:42.519 --> 01:44.562
but I find this very serendipitous.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.898
Maybe fate's tellin' you
you need a partner.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.733
This job is gonna be a real doozy.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.321
Get her as far away from here as possible.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.865
I don't care if you have
to drive her to Atlantis.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.451
Keep her away from that séance.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.578
I'd need a boat
to take her to Atlantis, boss.

Hi, Ollie.

02:10.004 --> 02:13.216

Sounds good.

02:37.532 --> 02:38.950
It's good to see you, Ollie.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.287
And it's disturbing to see you.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.123
Hey! Hey!

Damn it, Ollie.

Inverse self-reflections are present.

Present in both.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.454
That's fascinating.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.332
Every time I separate them,
they just find their way back together.

03:27.415 --> 03:28.583
They're sticking.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.795
-It's reminiscent of iteration 41.
-[Azumi] It has to be hardware.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.881
We should examine the IO spindle.

03:45.725 --> 03:46.935
[Azumi] Yeah, there...

03:48.353 --> 03:49.229
and there.

Just a little scoring.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.193
Maybe something inside the F housing.

But it's impossible to tell
while we're still running.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.240
Do you want to order a full reset?

04:01.199 --> 04:04.953
No, my mother was too conservative
when it came to these anomalies.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.832
Well, then, we'll push through.
I'll try to manage it manually.

-Is that Ollie Hightower?

-Is he as big a Cervantes fan as we are?

he'll take me under his wing.

Not tonight, kid. I work alone.

-[laughter]
-So I made him a bet.

I bet that I would do a trick
and he couldn't figure it out.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.458
And if I lost,
I would give up magic forever.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.169
-And if you won?
-[Ollie] He would give me his peerage.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.422
You see, I wanted his "sir".

07:03.256 --> 07:04.215

-[woman] How?
-[second woman] Tell us!

07:07.844 --> 07:09.387

-You can imagine--
-You can't give away a title like that.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.445
-Well, sure you can.
-But what was the trick, Ollie?

-Yes.

on the very top of this deck.

before I brought you back.

I think...

10:31.505 --> 10:32.882
we have a serious problem.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.967
I think our computer is...

10:37.428 --> 10:38.721
horribly depressed.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.395
And might be behaving unpredictably.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.065
We're both great admirers. Yes, I sensed it.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.990
Arlie Kane, I know all about you.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.286
I heard you two were separated.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.247
We were. No longer.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.168
Hon, let me get you a drink. Excuse me.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.048
Oh!

[Arlie] Hello.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.849
What's wrong with him?

11:25.559 --> 11:29.438
It's so hard to keep those
we've lost in our lives.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.024
Don't you agree?

11:34.610 --> 11:35.861
You must excuse me. All right. Okay.

Gotcha!

-Any lost chapters?
-[gasps] You and your zapping around.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.455
Why do you keep trying to ditch me, Ollie?

13:09.538 --> 13:11.248
Because you are on my continent.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.376
No more jokes, Arlie.
Go back to Paris. I'm working.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.005
-You still drink gimlets?
-You still poison 'em?

13:18.506 --> 13:19.799
I only poisoned the one.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.301
What should we cheers to?

13:22.384 --> 13:24.804
How about the night
my wife stole everything I have,

13:24.887 --> 13:26.347
slipped me a Mickey, disappeared,

13:26.430 --> 13:28.599
and I woke up with the cops
and three years in the clink.

13:28.682 --> 13:31.101
I heard you pled guilty
to that Sister Wendy job.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.229
Yeah, I have to quit doing that.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.564
So what happened
to this dame that betrayed you?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.150
Rumor has it
she ran off with another woman.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.903
Sounds like she might have had
some sort of condition.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.196
[Ollie] She did.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.908
She always disappeared
just when you needed her the most.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.535
To mistakes, then.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.166
You hear what I heard?

13:54.667 --> 13:58.254
-About what the lost chapter can do?
-No, and I don't care.

13:58.337 --> 14:02.091
1615, Cervantes writes the final chapter
to his masterpiece.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.467
So powerful...

14:04.051 --> 14:07.346
that anyone who reads it
is lost in their own fantasies...

14:07.596 --> 14:08.430
forever.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.308
He shows it to a friend,
who slips into a coma.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.686
Same with a neighbor, never comes out.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.939
They live in their own dream worlds
until they die.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.110
-Sounds swell.
-[Arlie] Cervantes thought the opposite.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.154
He said being lost like that
was a fate worse than death.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.575
For someone who didn't come here
for the lost chapter,

14:27.658 --> 14:29.952
you seem to have thought a lot
about the lost chapter.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.079
Don't be dense, Ollie.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.748
I'm not here for some score.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.375
But wouldn't you know?

14:36.834 --> 14:39.795
The lost chapter is hidden
somewhere in this mansion.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.924
I'm here to help you.

Goodbye, Arlie.

You don't know where it is, do you?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.395
'Cause I do. It's through a mirror.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.523
Who gave you that information?

14:59.607 --> 15:02.443
Some wise old crone
in an alleyway in Barcelona.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.695
What does it matter to you?

15:04.778 --> 15:07.448
Because you lie constantly, that's why.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.993
So what was your plan, then, Ollie?

15:11.327 --> 15:14.622
To snoop from room to room
until you happened upon it next September?

15:14.705 --> 15:17.082
Hah. Even if you knew where it was,

15:17.541 --> 15:19.084
she'd have it in a safe,

15:19.418 --> 15:22.212
and you can't crack a safe without me.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.672
Well, I'm here to help you.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.009
So for old times' sake, Mr. Magic Fingers,

15:27.092 --> 15:29.303
how about I do intel
and you crack the safe?

15:32.806 --> 15:35.100
We can't help but do
what we've always done.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.479
Do I have a choice in the matter?

15:39.772 --> 15:40.606
No.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.319
-[gong sounds]
-9:05, time for the main event.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.490
Do not make me regret trusting you.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.116
I'll never betray you again.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.410
Then wait for my signal.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.998
[butler] Oh, joyous Celestial Goddess,

15:58.332 --> 16:02.962
now is the time
for your energy to flow through us

16:03.045 --> 16:07.841
and pour life back
into our lady's beloved.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.510
[Gertie] Tonight we speak to Juno,

16:09.593 --> 16:11.720
tonight we speak to Diana

16:11.804 --> 16:15.182
and tonight her life brings life to us.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.309
Lunar goddess?

16:18.435 --> 16:20.896
Who will be tonight's astral nodes?

16:23.607 --> 16:24.441
Oh.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.404
Them, I think.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.114
Those two.

16:30.781 --> 16:31.615
Us?

16:39.915 --> 16:43.210
-What the hell are we supposed to do?
-The moon will tell you.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.671
[butler] We have reached...

16:46.130 --> 16:49.008
maximum illumination.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.176
[people gasp]

16:51.844 --> 16:53.095
["Exactly Like You" plays] They're playing our song.

17:21.999 --> 17:26.295
Stop trying to stick yourselves together!

17:28.505 --> 17:29.590
[people gasp]

17:29.840 --> 17:32.676
Oh, she's gone to the astral plane.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.470
Oh, it's working! It's working!

17:34.553 --> 17:38.057
Who wants to join her?
Another dancer. You. Now.

17:46.774 --> 17:47.608
Wait, wait.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.200
[man yells indistinctly]

17:56.950 --> 18:00.037
<i>...with a title that you trade away!</i>

18:01.330 --> 18:05.584
<i>Because I'm their father,</i>
<i>and you're their mother! God damn it!</i>

18:06.710 --> 18:08.796
<i>I have no idea where you are!</i>

18:08.879 --> 18:10.798
-Is Mom coming back?
-...that again.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.216
<i>Is that about the size of it?</i>

18:12.299 --> 18:15.636
-Um... tell me the whole story again.
<i>-You don't get to give that up, Rosie.</i>

18:15.803 --> 18:17.429
<i>-No!</i>
-Once upon a time...

18:18.388 --> 18:20.516
-there were two girls.
<i>-It's not a fucking title...</i>

18:20.599 --> 18:22.684
They rode through the forest on a wolf.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.269
A wolf, yeah.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.730
They were going
to their grandmother's house.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.315
But they didn't read the sign.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.860
So, they got lost
and couldn't really find their way home,

18:32.152 --> 18:35.572
-until they read one of the signs.
<i>-...our daughter, who has your hair...</i>

18:35.656 --> 18:37.407
It said, "Don't go this way."

18:37.491 --> 18:39.493
["Exactly Like You" playing]

18:49.586 --> 18:51.338
-Good evening, fellas.
-Evening.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.143
[applause]

19:05.352 --> 19:07.020
-[applause]
-[sighs]

19:11.817 --> 19:12.818
[grunting]

19:26.081 --> 19:27.332
You didn't wait for my signal.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.709
[gasps] Good gravy!

19:28.792 --> 19:31.086
[breathing heavily] Help me down.

19:39.052 --> 19:39.970
Come on.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.723
[man] Look down here.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.817
The mirror's right there.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.321
[man] Try this.

19:58.947 --> 19:59.907
Locked.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.202
Nothing here.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.286
[woman moans]

20:07.873 --> 20:10.209
[man and woman]
You're not supposed to be here.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.003
There's another way, come on.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.821
[man whispers] Owen.

20:39.905 --> 20:40.739
Owen.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.450
I mean, Sir-- Sir Ollie.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.204
So, I talked to a ritual cognitive.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.415
Turns out Jed and I
were twins in the womb.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.252
Except he strangled me
with the umbilical cord.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.586
[retching]

20:57.464 --> 20:58.548
[spitting]

21:01.009 --> 21:04.054
Don't worry about that.
That was... ectoplasm.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.223
Go back to your quest.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.351
Ah, Gertie's nuts. I'm gonna
stick around here a little bit.

21:12.562 --> 21:13.397
Matches.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.125
What is this?

21:33.208 --> 21:36.837
The old crone said the spirit would
take me exactly where I wanted to be.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.301
[wind blows]

21:48.974 --> 21:50.726
I don't know where to go from here.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.440
Do you know what they thought
owls meant in the old days?

21:58.859 --> 21:59.776
Come here.

22:14.708 --> 22:15.667
Finally.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.545
Something that makes sense.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.048
How long is this gonna take?

22:21.673 --> 22:23.342
This place gives me the willies.

22:24.718 --> 22:25.886
Hey, Arlie.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.306
Seeing we're both
inside a mirror and all...

22:29.890 --> 22:31.683
Do you ever think your condition...

22:33.352 --> 22:35.062
is a lot simpler than you think?

22:36.313 --> 22:38.899
Maybe you're the one
with the broken heart, not me,

22:38.982 --> 22:42.027
pretending I'm the one who's devastated.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.238
It's the way
that you make yourself feel stronger.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.282
Make me feel smaller.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.161
Sure.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.708
And maybe you like being the martyr
a little too much.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.922
And you thought that "sir" would fix you,
but it hasn't fixed anything at all.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.301
I guess we'll never know.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.552
[opens safe]

23:13.725 --> 23:15.060
[Arlie] Why is it so tiny?

23:15.977 --> 23:17.854
People were a lot smaller back then.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.408
All right.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.326
We should skeddadle.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.578
Sorry, Ollie.

23:35.038 --> 23:37.666
I'm gonna need you
to hand that tiny chapter to me.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.128
I just really, really need it.

23:43.088 --> 23:43.964
Sure.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.182
You didn't have to use the gun.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.394
I would have just given it to you.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.647
That's always been your problem.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.484
That's not my problem.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.741
My problem is I let you get too close.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.244
And you're poison.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.443
[Annie gasps]

25:33.657 --> 25:34.533
There she is.

25:38.745 --> 25:41.957
Subject nine, your experience
with the B pill is complete.

25:42.040 --> 25:42.999
Where's Ollie?

25:44.084 --> 25:47.837
[Mantleray] What you're about
to experience is the proximity test.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.799
It's a cross-check of the data
that we've gleaned.

25:51.466 --> 25:54.553
Helps the G.R.T.A. render
your reflections for the final pill.

25:54.970 --> 25:55.887
I'm a friend.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.514
And...

25:58.431 --> 25:59.474
this is normal.

26:01.601 --> 26:05.772
By the way, I was sorry to hear
about your sister being crushed,

26:05.855 --> 26:07.941
and then burned to death...

26:08.400 --> 26:09.901
in that car accident. [cameras whirr]

26:12.737 --> 26:13.572
So...

26:14.114 --> 26:16.825
Your score goes up or down
depending on the consistency

26:16.908 --> 26:19.869
between your answers and, uh...

26:20.870 --> 26:21.997
what we've observed.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.583
The scale is from zero to ten.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.793
Uh, anything below a 9.2

26:26.876 --> 26:29.963
results in the termination
of your experience at the trial

26:30.046 --> 26:31.423
due to, uh...

26:32.132 --> 26:33.300
a lack of progress.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.760
A lack of progress with what?

26:36.970 --> 26:38.930
The dissolution
of your defense mechanisms.

26:41.766 --> 26:42.601
Okay.

26:42.684 --> 26:46.062
Consider this just me
verifying that your data is usable.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.316
All you have to do is give
an honest account of your experience.

26:49.899 --> 26:52.611
So, let's start by saying your name
for a baseline.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.655
Annie Landsberg.

26:57.782 --> 26:58.742
And, uh...

26:58.825 --> 27:00.952
are you survived by any other relatives?

27:02.579 --> 27:04.080
Just my dad, Hank Landsberg.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.042
Your mother's deceased?

27:08.126 --> 27:09.002
I don't know.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.087
Huh.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.507
Do you know where you are right now?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.134
I'm in a pharma trial.

27:17.344 --> 27:21.014
Considering you've been
abusing the A pill for some time,

27:21.431 --> 27:25.060
I'd like you to tell me
about your experiences with the B pill.

27:27.228 --> 27:31.399
I had what felt like a hundred dreams
all on top of each other.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.901
I call them reflections.

27:32.984 --> 27:35.945
Neurochemically, they're very similar,
but so is psychosis.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.782
How many experiences
do you think you had?

27:40.533 --> 27:42.869
I remember two well.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.247
But there were more.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.834
And more underneath those.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.588
It's a globular cluster
of arborized realities.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.175
Well, they were realities
that mattered more than mine.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.094
Describe your reality.

28:00.553 --> 28:02.055
Uh, my reality...

28:05.225 --> 28:07.102
is that I am depressed. And I have been for a very long time.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.315
[counter clicks]

28:12.816 --> 28:15.402
[Mantleray] Let's try and focus
on your reflections.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.695
[camera whirrs]

28:18.905 --> 28:21.658
In one, I was Linda from Long Island.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.786
I could smell her perm.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.706
She was a nurse and a...

28:28.415 --> 28:31.251
mother, and a wife, which is...

28:32.085 --> 28:34.003
the opposite of anything I've ever wanted.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.385
And...

28:41.261 --> 28:42.137
then...

28:43.930 --> 28:47.642
I was Arlie.
She was a thief and a con artist.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.686
A con artist is a liar.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.689
Why are you a liar?

28:55.150 --> 28:55.984
She--

28:59.571 --> 29:01.489
I think people lie because they're afraid,

29:01.573 --> 29:04.284
and she was afraid
and she didn't want anyone to see that.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.287
Did anyone?

29:07.620 --> 29:09.581
Owen. He did.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.583
He saw me. He saw...

29:12.751 --> 29:13.585
her.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.170
Them.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.463
Subject one?

29:16.546 --> 29:18.298
Describe his presence.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.969
We were connected in all of them.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.265
With Linda...

29:28.725 --> 29:30.268
it was the kind of connection

29:30.351 --> 29:32.520
where you meet in seventh grade,
and then...

29:34.105 --> 29:37.400
you look up and 20 years later,
he's still there...

29:38.860 --> 29:40.612
holding your hand while you have a baby.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.492
You remembered whole lives together?

29:46.534 --> 29:47.452
Yes.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.330
Did the pill do that?

29:51.039 --> 29:52.248
It wasn't designed to.

29:54.375 --> 29:58.296
Why do you think you experience
so many of these, uh, lives...

29:58.713 --> 29:59.589
with him?

30:00.048 --> 30:02.383
-He said there was a pattern.
-[cameras whirr]

30:03.134 --> 30:05.762
And that we were connected
to each other somehow. I--

30:05.845 --> 30:07.472
I mean, I thought he was crazy.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.017
So, I told him there is no pattern.
There's just chaos.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.228
Let me ask it...

30:14.103 --> 30:15.230
in a different way.

30:16.022 --> 30:19.150
Why do you think you found yourself
trying to deliver a lemur?

30:20.276 --> 30:22.278
Mr. Milgrim's presence notwithstanding.

30:25.865 --> 30:28.284
The woman in that dream was Paula Nazlund,

30:30.245 --> 30:33.331
the mother of the person
that killed my sister.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.501
My real sister, in this life.

30:38.837 --> 30:42.215
And sometimes I fantasize about
if Greg Nazlund had never been born.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.217
And when you were a thief...

30:45.426 --> 30:47.178
how do you explain that reflection?

30:50.223 --> 30:51.516
I had a goal.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.060
[cameras whirr]

30:54.143 --> 30:55.687
I needed to get something.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.025
And it... didn't seem to matter
who I hurt.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.404
-Is that a behavior you share in life?
-No.

31:04.487 --> 31:07.699
Is that a behavior you've seen exhibited
in a parental figure?

31:07.782 --> 31:09.033
Is this therapy now?

31:10.034 --> 31:11.995
I thought this was supposed to be
better than that.

31:12.078 --> 31:13.329
It's not therapy.

31:18.918 --> 31:22.130
Did you enter this trial
in lieu of harming yourself?

31:22.213 --> 31:23.047
No!

31:25.341 --> 31:26.843
Why did the number not change?

31:27.719 --> 31:28.636
That's true.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.221
Were you suicidal?

31:33.808 --> 31:35.310
Arlie is like my mother.

31:38.021 --> 31:42.233
She could charm anyone,
she would make deals with people.

31:42.317 --> 31:45.862
She would say things to me like,
"This is just between you and me, Annie.

31:45.945 --> 31:49.282
You're the only one who understands."
That's how she would get you.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.451
And then she knew that you gave a shit,

31:51.534 --> 31:53.953
and so your guard was down
and she would gut you.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.038
Okay? How's that?

31:55.121 --> 31:58.249
It disturbs you, this idea of...

31:58.917 --> 32:01.753
behaving in the same way
that your mother behaves.

32:03.504 --> 32:05.381
[cameras whirring]

32:05.465 --> 32:06.299
Yes.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.888
Did you and your sister
make any of these special...

32:12.805 --> 32:13.723
deals?

32:15.224 --> 32:17.894
Similar to the ones
that you and your mother had made?

32:18.186 --> 32:19.062
No.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.190
Ours were different.

32:25.109 --> 32:25.985
How?

32:27.487 --> 32:28.696
Ours was a pact.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.906
[counter clicks]

32:34.035 --> 32:36.037
I took care of her when we were little. And she took care of me when we grew up.

32:40.750 --> 32:41.876
[counter clicks]

32:41.960 --> 32:43.920
[printer whirring]

32:48.675 --> 32:49.801
[paper prints]

32:57.725 --> 32:59.268
Here's your diagnostic.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.449
Someone will be through shortly
to collect you.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.166
What's your report?

33:22.750 --> 33:25.003
Your security
leaves something to be desired.

33:25.586 --> 33:27.088
Expect a bill first thing.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.385
It doesn't work, you know.

33:32.844 --> 33:33.845
The chapter. I already tried.

33:35.722 --> 33:39.600
Every mistake I've ever made
started with "It's too good to be true."

33:47.108 --> 33:48.609
So, what do you say, Ollie?

33:49.444 --> 33:50.570
About a partnership?

33:51.988 --> 33:56.242
I told you where the safe was.
That's gotta be worth somethin', right?

33:57.452 --> 33:58.494
Took me a minute.

33:59.037 --> 33:59.954
Thanks for that.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.498
But I don't do partners.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.460
What would you have wished for...

34:06.294 --> 34:07.712
if that chapter had worked?

34:08.755 --> 34:10.590
I keep my fantasies to myself.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.927
Well, maybe I'll see you again
sometime soon.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.603
Bobby, you've got some explaining to do.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.021
[chuckles]

34:26.522 --> 34:27.648
[engine starts]

34:40.078 --> 34:42.163
["Exactly Like You" plays on radio]

34:43.289 --> 34:44.874
[Bobby] You want me to turn it off?

34:45.625 --> 34:48.127
-No, no, you can leave it, Bobby.
<i>-♪ Exactly like you ♪</i>

34:49.337 --> 34:50.713
I'm really sorry, boss.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.090
She shot me.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.802
She shot you, Bobby?

34:57.762 --> 34:58.930
Only in the shoulder.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.434
I've been trying to motivate myself
to get in there.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.977
I haven't been able to move.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.397
She really wanted to come to the party.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.779
Did you and her reconnect, at least?

35:17.323 --> 35:19.075
No, it didn't work out.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.954
She had too much else on her mind.

35:23.037 --> 35:23.913
Hm.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.542
Aren't you gonna miss her, boss?

35:29.001 --> 35:29.919
[sighs]

35:30.878 --> 35:32.046
You know what, Bobby?

35:34.340 --> 35:37.093
Life is simple as hell
until you bring on a partner.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.402
[woman] Welcome back, subjects.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.528
Welcome back.
