00:15.200 --> 00:17.880
Finally, I'd like to toast
the man himself.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.920
The man who made
my best friend smile again.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.560
Aww!

00:21.640 --> 00:22.920
To Marcus Brookner.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.200
Cheers!

00:24.280 --> 00:25.400
Michaela and Marcus!

00:25.480 --> 00:27.360
- Cheers.
-Woo!

00:27.440 --> 00:28.520
-Ha!
-Uh!

00:28.600 --> 00:30.880
-I thought you were giving up.
-It's the '50s, Tina.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.360
Everyone smokes.

00:32.440 --> 00:33.360
Love you!

00:55.680 --> 00:57.640
-That's a beautiful ring.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.120
Thanks.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.720
Marcus has taste.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.960
Sorry, do I know you?

01:05.040 --> 01:08.760
I have to ask. Did you and David break up
before or after the video went viral?

01:09.800 --> 01:11.040
-What?
-David Thornton.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.920
Your boyfriend before Marcus, right?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.760
Is this some kind of joke?

01:15.840 --> 01:16.680
No.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.680
-You've seen it?
-Just for a few seconds.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.720
I... didn't watch it all.
I wouldn't. I just had to make sure.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.120
Yeah, it's me.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.760
And had you and David broken up when...?

01:27.840 --> 01:29.960
When he put that video online.
It's called revenge porn.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.520
Yeah, I know what it is.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.680
But David didn't do it.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.880
Did he send you?

01:40.560 --> 01:41.760
Look, I don't know the guy.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.840
I've never had any contact with him.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.520
-Michaela!
-Do you think this is funny?!

01:45.600 --> 01:48.640
Everyone saw it, you know, everyone,
not just a few perverts online.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.280
My friends, colleagues, my parents.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.040
No, I don't find this funny at all.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.120
-Then why are you defending him?
-He didn't do it.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
Then who did?

01:57.160 --> 01:58.880
Your fiancé, Marcus.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.160
He did it to break you and David up.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.800
The porn site he used claims
to keep the user's IP address anonymous.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.720
But it's the Internet, Michaela.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.160
Everyone leaves a trace.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.640
It's all in there.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.040
I know it'll take time
to come to terms with it,

02:13.120 --> 02:14.400
but you'll thank me eventually.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.680
Do you plan on telling anyone else?

02:17.200 --> 02:18.160
No.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.040
Take the envelope.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.920
The proof is all in there.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.440
Now you can expose his secret.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.960
You didn't reveal a secret.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.200
You just created another one.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.160
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

02:46.240 --> 02:48.920
<i>♪ Danger knocking at my door ♪</i>

02:49.000 --> 02:51.840
<i>♪ Don't come 'round here no more ♪</i>

02:51.920 --> 02:54.240
<i>♪ I check the locks</i>
<i>Shut the windows down ♪</i>

02:54.320 --> 02:57.280
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

03:05.560 --> 03:07.720
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

03:08.360 --> 03:11.680
When Corinne does return home, can you ask
her to come see me at the police station?

03:11.760 --> 03:13.760
What exactly is she accused of?

03:14.240 --> 03:16.680
Like I said, money's been stolen
from the football team.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.040
When?

03:18.520 --> 03:21.320
She wouldn't steal from anyone.
You know that.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.880
She needs to answer that for herself.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.200
Jason, Corinne's been handling
that account for ten years.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.360
There's never been an issue.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.800
What makes you think
she'd try something now?

03:29.640 --> 03:32.280
-An allegation's been made.
-Don't look good though, does it?

03:32.960 --> 03:34.920
Thousands missing from the pot,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.200
your missus goes AWOL.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.480
-That money was for the boys.
-My son is one of those boys.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.800
Lads, hey, we know that.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.280
No one would accuse her of anything

03:43.360 --> 03:45.000
without knowing exactly what's going on.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.480
Would they, Bob?

03:48.480 --> 03:49.320
No.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.360
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.600
So are you... Are you gonna arrest her?

03:57.040 --> 03:58.160
That's not up to me.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.760
I'm not here as a police officer.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.640
Just a member of the football club,
offering you some advice.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.120
It'd be better all around if Corinne
came down to the station.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.520
So you're not gonna arrest her?

04:07.480 --> 04:11.320
Well, then, you and I both know that she's
not obliged to go anywhere or do anything.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.560
I'll let her know you came by.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.000
Good night.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.240
Don't know about you,
but I could murder a beer.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.040
There you go.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.880
Do you wanna tell me what's going on?

04:50.480 --> 04:51.680
Corinne and I had a row.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.800
Trouble in the bedroom?

04:56.520 --> 04:57.600
She's gone, mate.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.160
What do you mean?

05:01.760 --> 05:02.880
She said...

05:03.720 --> 05:05.800
she needed more space, which...

05:06.240 --> 05:07.400
I'm happy to give,

05:07.480 --> 05:09.520
but she's killed all contact.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.720
And now they're saying
this money's been stolen.

05:16.880 --> 05:17.800
Did she say anything?

05:17.880 --> 05:22.720
Something that might help you find out
where she is or why she went?

05:22.800 --> 05:23.760
She said...

05:26.760 --> 05:28.600
"Maybe we need some time apart.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.400
You take care of the kids.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.480
Don't try to contact me.
We'll be okay. Just give me a few days."

05:37.200 --> 05:38.080
Listen.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.360
You know Corinne better than anyone.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.560
She's not capable of stealing any money.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.600
Is she?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.160
Sorry, mate.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.440
Sorry. Hello.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.280
Yeah.

05:57.080 --> 05:57.960
I've gotta go.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.640
- Daisy?

06:13.120 --> 06:14.160
Everything okay?

06:14.240 --> 06:15.200
No, not really.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.480
Who was that guy? Why did he chase us?

06:19.560 --> 06:20.600
Have you heard from Mike?

06:20.680 --> 06:21.880
I've been calling him.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.560
I've got no idea where he is.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.080
When did you two sneak in?

06:30.400 --> 06:31.520
What's that?

06:31.920 --> 06:32.760
I fell over.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.440
Do you think that policeman
will come back?

06:35.840 --> 06:36.680
What?

06:36.760 --> 06:37.720
Mr. Yeong.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.040
From football. He came looking for Dad.
Do you think he'll be back?

06:42.360 --> 06:43.560
I don't know, mate.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.880
It's not about us, is it?

06:48.960 --> 06:50.040
I don't know.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.240
I think you should go.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.160
Let me handle this.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.920
All right.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.800
Thanks.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.760
Corinne, I've just had the police here.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.920
They're saying that money's been stolen
from the team.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.280
Love, please.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.600
I can't help you
if you keep shutting me out, okay?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.480
Just call me.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.840
Come on, sit down.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.680
Look, I know the last couple of days
has been a bit confusing,

07:35.760 --> 07:38.360
but there is nothing
to worry about, I promise.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.320
The police just wanna talk to Mom,
and it makes sense, doesn't it, if...

07:42.000 --> 07:44.640
if money's been stolen,
then they have to consult with her.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.560
-She's the treasurer.
-Where is she?

07:48.560 --> 07:50.480
She's... um...

07:50.560 --> 07:52.240
gone to another teacher's conference.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.680
-Again?
-Why?

07:53.760 --> 07:55.680
Look, I'm just telling you
what she told me.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.040
Maybe something to do with
the new exam criteria, I dunno.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.720
What do we do in the meantime?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.120
Come on, mate.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.440
We can muddle through
for a couple of days.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.600
I'm not completely useless, am I?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.080
Not completely.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.960
Oh, thanks. I'm honored.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.600
Right. How about a bit
of my famous spag bol?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.560
What makes it so famous?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.160
Heidi, call when you get this.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.680
I'm about to send you a link
to a 17-day spice trail

08:21.760 --> 08:23.400
through southern India.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.080
There's bike riding,

08:26.160 --> 08:29.760
hill station trek,
and daily cookery demonstration.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.880
So we can have a proper look
at it tonight.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.920
India?

08:33.680 --> 08:35.760
Oh. Thinking about it, yeah.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.080
With Phillip?

08:37.720 --> 08:40.040
Phillip and I
have separated recently, actually.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.200
Oh. I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.960
No, it's fine.
Honestly, don't worry about it.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.600
So who are you going with?

08:46.680 --> 08:47.680
Just a friend.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.480
Good friend, I hope.

08:51.720 --> 08:52.600
Sorry?

08:53.520 --> 08:56.480
Well, you know, you gotta
have the right... travel buddy.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.760
You'll be kicking yourself,
you take the wrong person.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.520
All that annual leave up the spout.

09:01.040 --> 09:01.920
Blow that.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.160
I'm retiring soon
so I can do what I like.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.640
Besides, we did a week

09:07.720 --> 09:10.720
of torrential rain
in a caravan in Llandudno.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.920
That was the best holiday I've ever had,
so I think we'll manage.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.080
Fair play.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.320
Thank you.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.960
Johanna, Mike Tripp's booked in.
The dad's here.

09:41.040 --> 09:41.880
Great.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.680
All right.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.400
We're all set.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.440
<i>So, how did a bag</i>
<i>covered in blood</i>

10:13.520 --> 10:15.040
come to be in your possession, Mike?

10:15.320 --> 10:16.680
You should be thanking him.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.760
People use those woods like a fly tip.
It's a disgrace.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.960
Once again, Mr. Tripp,

10:22.040 --> 10:24.760
your role is not to answer questions
on Mike's behalf,

10:25.400 --> 10:28.560
but to assist
if he doesn't understand the question.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.400
Do you understand the question, Mike?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.800
-Yeah.
-Good.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.560
So the bag was carrying
a significant amount of blood.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.600
Now, we've sent that off
for forensic examination,

10:39.680 --> 10:43.240
but you'd be saving us a lot of time
if you told us where it's from.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.800
For the benefit of the tape,
I'm presenting Mike

10:48.880 --> 10:51.000
with photographs from the crime scene.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.720
This alpaca was taken from a local breeder
three days ago,

10:54.800 --> 10:56.320
before being decapitated.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.200
Take a look.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.120
I don't think either of us believe

11:10.200 --> 11:13.040
that you were strolling
through the woods at night,

11:13.120 --> 11:15.400
doing a bit of selfless litter collection.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.840
Oh, come off it.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.240
Look at him. He's not capable
of ripping that thing apart.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.680
What about these?

11:21.760 --> 11:23.280
Looks like there was a party.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.920
There's evidence of drug misuse.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.600
Both of these were taken less than a mile
from where Dante Gunnarsson was found.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.360
He's now on life support

11:31.440 --> 11:33.160
in Cedarfield Royal Infirmary.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.920
And if he dies tomorrow...

11:35.480 --> 11:37.400
this becomes a murder investigation.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.480
And right now,
you are the link in all of this.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.280
Or we could just press on

11:43.360 --> 11:44.880
and take some DNA samples.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.240
Okay, fine.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.240
I was there.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.920
I scored some hash.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.320
Everyone did.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.080
I lost a baggy and I just thought
someone might've dropped it

11:58.160 --> 11:59.320
in an empty bin or whatever.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.760
So I just wanted to take the bag home
to have a proper look.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.520
That all makes sense.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.840
-We'll get going.
-Oh, sit down, Mr. Tripp.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.360
What about Dante Gunnarsson?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.160
Do you remember seeing him that night?

12:15.280 --> 12:16.360
Saw him about, yeah.

12:17.560 --> 12:20.560
Notice anything strange about him,
about his behavior?

12:20.640 --> 12:21.960
No more than normal.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.440
Well, what does that mean?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.680
I don't wanna badmouth him, he's ill.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.440
Go on, it's okay.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.960
Well, he's a twat.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.200
Sorry, but he is.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.360
He's always filming people

12:36.840 --> 12:39.280
and he gets on everyone's nerves.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.440
It's not just me.

12:40.520 --> 12:41.880
Right. That's enough.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.720
He's a minor. We're done here.
He's not under arrest.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.280
All right.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.120
Interview terminated at 22:33.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.240
Listen.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.880
He's no different from his old man.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.040
I used to be into acid house.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.560
Spent the best part of the '90s
with eyes like dinner plates.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.240
-Stories I could tell you.
-Right.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.760
Withholding information is a serious crime

13:10.840 --> 13:12.960
which could lead to a custodial sentence.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.640
DC Ross will see you out.

13:16.880 --> 13:17.920
Good night, Mr. Tripp.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.240
Follow me.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.320
That kid was shook.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.040
He's what?

13:30.120 --> 13:31.920
Shook. Worried.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.480
-Shitting bricks.
-Good, he should be.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.800
Get one of the boys to update the file.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.160
-Where are you going?
-Um...

13:37.560 --> 13:39.800
I'm going home. You can stay if you want.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.160
And we'll drop by the Gunnarssons'
first thing. You bring the coffee.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.240
Mmm.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.480
Hi, Heidi.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.160
Sorry, I know we were supposed to meet,

14:01.240 --> 14:03.560
but work's gone mental.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.040
I could pop around tomorrow night
if you want.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.840
You're not pissed off at me, are you?

14:09.160 --> 14:10.720
Anyway, hope you're all right.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.120
Give us a call when you get this message.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.600
Bye.

14:33.720 --> 14:34.840
-Morning.
-Morning.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.720
Oh, gross.

14:43.320 --> 14:46.520
Mom, halls of residence for uni,
I need to pick one by tomorrow.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.680
Wow.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.600
Thanks for tidying up.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.680
Where's Mike?
Shouldn't you two have left already?

14:58.760 --> 15:01.480
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
he's probably ill or something.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.280
-Was this you?
-Someone had to.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.440
Did you do the laundry as well?

15:09.160 --> 15:11.360
I wouldn't touch your crusty pants
for a million quid.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.920
<i>We'd like to see</i>
<i>if there's anything in Dante's room</i>

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
<i>that can help us figure out</i>
<i>what's happened.</i>

15:34.080 --> 15:36.000
I haven't been in this room since.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.880
It's okay. There's no rush.

15:38.560 --> 15:39.680
How is Dante doing?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.520
They wanna take him in for surgery
after the seizure.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.520
He's in an induced coma for now.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.800
Well, we won't take up too much
of your time.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.760
Come this way.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.360
We wanted to ask,
how was Dante before the incident?

16:05.440 --> 16:08.040
Did he talk about being unhappy
at school or--

16:08.600 --> 16:11.400
No. He's popular, well-liked.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.600
He's got a channel on YouTube,

16:13.680 --> 16:15.240
three thousand subscribers.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.240
He didn't seem to have any problems.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.800
No, if there was something wrong,
he would have told us, I'm sure of it.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.240
Sorry, I have to go to the hospital.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.880
You're more than welcome
to look around while I pack things.

16:25.960 --> 16:26.920
Thank you.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.120
Oh, um, I don't suppose
we can access his computer.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.440
Go ahead.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.320
We all have the same password:

16:33.400 --> 16:35.480
Shamanicsoundbath97.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.280
Don't.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.160
Look here.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.960
She was at the hospital.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.320
-What do you think? Girlfriend?
- Hmm.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.000
Maybe. That'd be creepy.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.640
<i>Go on, son!</i>

17:24.040 --> 17:25.000
<i>Well done, mate!</i>

17:34.520 --> 17:35.400
Take a look at this.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.120
He's got a lot of videos of her.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.360
Hey.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.480
All right?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.040
Did you get a lift off Mike?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.600
No. I've been texting him all night.
He hasn't answered.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.520
Have you heard from him?

18:06.640 --> 18:08.960
If he's not answering you,
he's not about to call me, is he?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.320
You sure he wasn't at assembly?

18:12.400 --> 18:13.240
No.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.480
Listen, I...
I need to tell you something.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.920
Are you guys talking about Mike?

18:19.440 --> 18:21.480
-Why?
-Haven't you heard?

18:21.560 --> 18:22.440
He's been arrested.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.560
What?

18:23.640 --> 18:25.360
Think it was something to do
with the party?

18:27.840 --> 18:28.840
Come on.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.680
In here.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.760
Don't get angry.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.280
I spiked him.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.680
You what?

18:48.760 --> 18:51.480
At the party,
I... I laced Mike's drink with some dust.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.560
Dust? What, like PCP?

18:53.640 --> 18:56.200
-I didn't think he'd hurt anyone.
-That stuff's lethal, you know.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.280
-He deserved it.
-Why?

18:58.360 --> 19:01.200
He put nudes on the Internet and said
they were of my 14-year-old sister.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.080
That was Mike?
How'd you know it was him?

19:04.920 --> 19:06.720
Trust me, I know.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.400
Jesus.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.200
Makes you wonder what else
he could be capable of, doesn't it?

19:14.040 --> 19:14.880
No.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.160
No way. Look, I've been friends with Mike
since I was, like, two.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.720
He's done some pretty dumb shit,
but he's not a bad guy.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.680
The alpaca head, okay,
yeah, maybe, if he was really out of it.

19:26.760 --> 19:27.960
But attacking Dante--

19:28.040 --> 19:30.080
He's been arrested, Thomas.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.280
And if Dante dies...

19:32.960 --> 19:34.280
does that make me, like...

19:35.680 --> 19:36.960
an accessory to murder?

19:38.960 --> 19:40.360
-What are you doing?
-Sorry, Miss.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.040
The bell rang ten minutes ago.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.520
-What is going on with you two?
-Nothing, Mom.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.040
You stay away from my family! You hear me?

20:29.280 --> 20:30.360
Corinne?

20:30.440 --> 20:31.640
<i>Hello, Adam.</i>

20:32.720 --> 20:34.000
Dad. What do you want?

20:35.120 --> 20:37.200
I just got off the phone to my man Parth.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.640
<i>Poor you.</i>

20:38.720 --> 20:41.760
We're a step closer to finalizing
the compulsory purchase order.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.880
Oh, you made
a really impressive case yesterday,

20:44.960 --> 20:48.280
but this contract now has
full council endorsement.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.120
<i>We are benefiting</i>
<i>an entire community here.</i>

20:51.200 --> 20:54.120
<i>You do know we're in the throes</i>
<i>of a national housing crisis?</i>

20:54.200 --> 20:57.120
Those apartments
start at half a million for a studio.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.880
Oh, come on, Adam.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.920
Have you seen the kind of comp
we're offering him?

21:03.440 --> 21:06.520
Killane could afford
to buy up an entire floor.

21:06.920 --> 21:07.800
<i>Listen.</i>

21:07.880 --> 21:10.240
I know this is hard for you
to get your head around,

21:10.320 --> 21:11.600
but not everyone can be bought.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.120
Can we get past this?

21:13.200 --> 21:14.040
<i>Past what?</i>

21:14.320 --> 21:16.760
Oh, your wounded animal act.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.360
-What?
<i>-I get it.</i>

21:18.440 --> 21:20.640
<i>I didn't teach you</i>
<i>to ride a bike when you were six.</i>

21:20.720 --> 21:22.000
<i>You think I'm a terrible father.</i>

21:22.080 --> 21:23.200
I get it.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.160
Let's move on.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.400
This has got nothing to do with that.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.200
<i>Well, why do you think Killane hired you?</i>

21:29.280 --> 21:31.880
He knows I'm on the board.
That's why he picked you.

21:31.960 --> 21:32.840
What?

21:35.240 --> 21:36.080
I've gotta go.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.800
Hey!

22:33.560 --> 22:34.760
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.480
Hi.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.200
Oh, it's lovely to see you.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.440
-Nice to see you too.
-You feeling better?

22:40.520 --> 22:42.880
-I'm good. I am tired though.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.160
Hey, guys.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.520
There was this woman, Suzanne Hope.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.720
So she faked a pregnancy?

23:01.560 --> 23:02.640
You on a stakeout?

23:03.440 --> 23:04.280
Sorry?

23:04.880 --> 23:05.920
The baby group.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.880
Don't worry,
they do have the odd man drop in.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.640
First time dad, right?

23:11.640 --> 23:12.480
Is it that obvious?

23:13.240 --> 23:15.080
-Yeah.
-Can I get a flat white, please?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.120
Coming up.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.040
Hiya. Sorry, can I get
a honey lemon, please?

23:23.120 --> 23:25.280
- Be right with you.
-Thanks. Hey.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.720
Suzanne?

23:31.800 --> 23:33.480
-Excuse me. Get off!
-Wait.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.600
-What are you doing?!
-I didn't mean to hurt you.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.480
My wife, Corinne,
Corinne Price, she's missing.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.560
So was that your husband
that I met the other day?

23:45.160 --> 23:46.000
Yeah.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.960
Why did he react like that
when I mentioned Corinne?

23:52.960 --> 23:55.240
Corinne thought I should leave him.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.120
Well, maybe she had a point.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.040
Look, I haven't seen Corinne
in a long time.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.120
How long?

24:02.200 --> 24:03.160
Oh, two, three years.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.520
So you haven't seen her since...?

24:07.560 --> 24:09.280
Since she figured out I was lying

24:09.360 --> 24:11.200
about my pregnancy? No.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.120
But see, she was always nice to me.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.880
Like, she understood.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.280
Yeah, I'm sure she did.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.560
What do you mean?

24:22.360 --> 24:24.880
Corinne faked a pregnancy.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.520
I see.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.440
How many times have you done this?

24:35.240 --> 24:36.680
I've lost count, to be honest.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.080
I can't have kids.

24:42.560 --> 24:46.200
Initially, I just wanted to know
how it would feel.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.120
You know, I was actually planning
on sending it straight back.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.720
But I thought,
"I'll just go for a little walk.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.400
Try it out."

24:55.840 --> 24:58.840
And straightaway, like,
as soon as I opened the door,

24:59.480 --> 25:01.800
it was like people were seeing me
for the first time.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.040
I mean, they held open doors,

25:03.120 --> 25:06.160
offered me their seats,
asked me how I was feeling.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.480
I had friends.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.560
And yes,
I know how mad that must sound, but...

25:13.600 --> 25:14.720
Do you see what I'm saying?

25:15.880 --> 25:18.760
Hey, it's not easy for me
to form attachments to other...

25:20.760 --> 25:23.040
To anyone, actually.
You've met my husband.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.000
Does he know about this?

25:25.920 --> 25:26.760
No.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.200
You know, I actually
had to pay someone off once,

25:31.280 --> 25:32.480
just so he wouldn't find out.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.640
Yeah, she threatened to tell my husband

25:35.720 --> 25:37.960
unless I gave her five grand.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.360
I mean, it was all my savings,
but I couldn't risk it.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.360
You were blackmailed?

25:41.760 --> 25:42.600
Yeah.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.800
But it wasn't just about the money.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.720
This woman was weird.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.200
-What woman?
-It's like I had personally offended her.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.280
What did she look like?

25:52.440 --> 25:53.840
Shit. I'm sorry, I have to go.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.240
-Wait.
-He knows I'm not at work.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.200
Suzanne?

26:23.720 --> 26:24.800
Don't you ever go to work?

26:25.400 --> 26:27.080
I need you to help me find someone.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.560
Again?

26:29.520 --> 26:30.480
It's my wife.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.840
This woman finds out intimate, personal
secrets and then threatens to go public.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.240
Suzanne Hope said
she blackmailed her, five grand.

26:40.320 --> 26:43.040
So you think this woman
blackmailed Corinne

26:43.120 --> 26:45.400
and she stole the football money
to pay her off?

26:45.480 --> 26:48.240
I know it looks that way, but no...

26:49.120 --> 26:50.440
She wouldn't, no way.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.640
And, um, this text she sent you,

26:55.720 --> 26:57.600
what exactly did it say?

26:57.840 --> 27:00.760
Uh, that she needs some time away

27:00.840 --> 27:02.000
and not to contact her.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.800
I know, I know.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.480
Women leave, Adam,

27:07.560 --> 27:09.600
and sometimes they don't come back.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.520
Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean to pick at old scars.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.760
Your wife... Just right now, I...

27:15.240 --> 27:17.200
I just don't know anybody else
that can help me.

27:17.800 --> 27:18.720
Never mind that.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.280
It's too late for me, my ship has sailed.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.400
But that doesn't mean
we can't help you, does it?

27:26.720 --> 27:27.560
So...

27:28.320 --> 27:30.320
where did this woman first approach you?

27:30.880 --> 27:32.040
At the football club.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.000
Hello, Max.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.000
Don't shake. Germs.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.000
Oh, right.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.640
There's no matches today.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.000
Yeah, I know. I know. Actually, um...

27:53.040 --> 27:55.240
I was wondering if you could help me
with something else.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.920
I was here the other night.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.760
Saturday, 18:15 till 20:53.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.920
Wow. Yeah.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.520
Uh, there was a woman in a gray Honda.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.320
I remember. With the blonde lady.

28:08.920 --> 28:09.840
Yeah, yeah.

28:10.800 --> 28:11.840
Um...

28:11.920 --> 28:12.800
Anyway, she...

28:13.240 --> 28:15.040
scratched my car as she left,

28:15.120 --> 28:17.120
and I didn't get
her insurance details, so...

28:17.200 --> 28:19.000
I don't suppose you took down
her number plate?

28:19.120 --> 28:20.560
Oh, yeah, I've got record of it.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.480
Great.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.360
Can I have it?

28:25.440 --> 28:27.320
Two hundred quid.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.360
What?

28:28.440 --> 28:29.880
She scratched your car?

28:29.960 --> 28:31.640
-Yeah.
-What, that one?

28:31.880 --> 28:32.800
Uh-huh.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.560
I've been working here 14 years, pal.

28:35.640 --> 28:38.720
Nothing gets past me.
If she scratched it, I would've twigged.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.080
Max...

28:40.160 --> 28:42.240
You want that number plate
for a different reason.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.640
All right, 150.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.640
Look, that's... that's all I've got.

28:52.720 --> 28:53.680
That will do.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.960
-N-C--
-Wait, wait, wait, hang on.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.240
Go on.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.120
N-C-6-5-

29:03.200 --> 29:05.520
F-J-X.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.440
Cheers, Max.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.040
How's that lovely wife of yours?

29:10.120 --> 29:11.520
Haven't seen her in a while.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.200
No.

29:14.520 --> 29:15.760
-She's been away.
-Oh.

29:16.240 --> 29:17.240
I like her.

29:51.200 --> 29:55.440
It's a rental car
currently hired by one Ingrid Prisby.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.920
Not easy to trace a rental car, you know?

30:06.080 --> 30:06.920
Hey.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.160
Wait.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.600
-Yeah, her, it was her.
-Get off.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.360
Well...

30:18.600 --> 30:22.400
She's in admin at an Internet startup.

30:24.920 --> 30:25.760
Uh...

30:26.320 --> 30:27.160
What is it?

30:27.240 --> 30:29.640
This page hasn't been updated
in over two years.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.560
My guess is that
she doesn't work there anymore.

30:31.640 --> 30:33.080
-Calm down.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.840
I know a guy who owes me a favor.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.240
I could ask him to run a check on her,
see if she's got any form.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.800
-It'll take a couple of days,
-Can't you tell him it's an emergency?

30:43.880 --> 30:47.080
Your wife getting the hump
is not an emergency.

30:48.160 --> 30:49.280
The reason I can...

30:49.760 --> 30:52.840
ask for favors
is because I don't take the piss.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.320
Can I ask you a question?
Will you be honest?

30:58.400 --> 30:59.400
Sure, go ahead.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.320
Did you know my dad
was on the development board

31:02.400 --> 31:03.240
when you hired me?

31:03.320 --> 31:04.520
Is that why you hired me?

31:04.600 --> 31:06.240
What are you talking about? 'Course not.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.480
And you're absolutely sure
you wanna fight this? Because...

31:14.360 --> 31:16.240
there's a lot to like about the offer.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.840
-Big money.
-I don't care.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.440
That's not what it's about for me.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.480
I raised my child here.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.000
I know it's a shit heap, but...

31:26.600 --> 31:27.920
after my wife leaving...

31:29.560 --> 31:30.680
this is all I've got.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.040
Besides...

31:35.400 --> 31:38.920
what am I gonna do with a wine fridge
or 24-hour gym?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Fair enough.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.280
Sat nav.

31:49.480 --> 31:50.600
You what?

31:50.680 --> 31:51.600
Her car.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.240
Some of these rental cars
have a black box system.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.400
Which means you can trace it, right?

31:57.920 --> 32:02.360
Are you suggesting that I hack
a private tele-monitoring system?

32:04.360 --> 32:05.200
How long?

32:06.320 --> 32:07.400
Put on the kettle.

32:16.280 --> 32:20.160
You don't fancy a drink later, do you?
Heidi's been ignoring me all day.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.280
God, scraping the barrel.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.600
No, I didn't mean it like that.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.040
Sorry, can't. Second date.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.880
Second?
Blimey, that's bordering on stable.

32:27.960 --> 32:28.920
It's just a drink.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.960
Can cancel if you want.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.240
No, don't be daft.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.320
Should get on it, you know.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.240
-What?
-Tinder.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.640
-Oh!
-Why not? You're a good-looking woman.

32:41.480 --> 32:42.960
-I'm far too old for that.
-Bollocks.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.800
Everyone's on it, even weirdos like me.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.800
-Right, I'm on lunch.
-After that?

32:46.880 --> 32:49.280
That was just a mere appetizer.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.680
- Bye, love.
-Mmm.

33:00.840 --> 33:03.000
- <i>Hello?</i>
-Hi, Ian. It's Johanna.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.000
Is Heidi around or...?

33:05.080 --> 33:07.080
<i>Oh, I'm not home, I'm afraid.</i>
<i>I'm in Paris.</i>

33:07.160 --> 33:08.640
Oh, I'm sorry, love.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.640
I've forgotten you're away with work.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.680
How's Paris?

33:11.760 --> 33:14.240
<i>Far too hot. I'm back later</i>
<i>this afternoon. Do you want me to--?</i>

33:14.320 --> 33:16.920
No, no, I'll catch her later at the café.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.480
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Okay, love.

33:18.560 --> 33:19.880
<i>-All right, then.</i>
-Take care, bye.

33:19.960 --> 33:20.880
<i>Speak to you later.</i>

33:34.520 --> 33:37.160
-Brickfield Cottage, South Moorcroft.
-What?

33:37.240 --> 33:39.200
I couldn't hack the system
but I found the car.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.600
Ingrid Prisby
is in South Moorcroft right now.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.160
-Get out! Get out of my house!
-Shit!

35:16.240 --> 35:17.920
-Okay-- Who are you?!
-Who are you?!

35:18.000 --> 35:20.560
-Okay, look, stop! I'm not gonna hurt you!
-What do you want?!

35:20.640 --> 35:22.240
I'm trying to find my wife, Corinne!

35:22.320 --> 35:23.240
I'll call the police!

35:23.320 --> 35:26.200
There was, um... a car here earlier,
a gray Honda.

35:26.280 --> 35:27.120
Did she send you?

35:27.200 --> 35:28.640
-Who? Who's she?
-That woman.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.280
No. No, nobody sent me, okay?

35:30.360 --> 35:32.960
I'm just trying to find the driver
of that car and her friend.

35:33.040 --> 35:33.880
Why?

35:33.960 --> 35:36.240
Because I thought
that she might be able to help me.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.080
She had access to, to...

35:38.520 --> 35:40.680
personal information about my family.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.320
-So I'm not the only one?
-Wait, what do you mean?

35:56.120 --> 35:57.040
Uh...

35:58.800 --> 36:00.520
Well, I take it this...

36:00.600 --> 36:02.560
personal information
wasn't particularly welcome.

36:02.960 --> 36:03.880
No.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
What did she do to you?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.440
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you, okay?

36:17.000 --> 36:18.120
Okay, uh...

36:19.000 --> 36:20.440
Last year, yeah...

36:21.600 --> 36:23.160
my ex-boyfriend, David,

36:23.240 --> 36:25.360
he leaked a very graphic,

36:25.440 --> 36:27.480
private video of us online.

36:27.840 --> 36:31.400
It went viral. It was categorically
the worst thing that has...

36:32.120 --> 36:33.320
ever happened to me.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.160
But I left him, I moved on,

36:36.240 --> 36:38.160
and I got engaged to his friend Marcus.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.840
Uh, everything was fine
until that woman crashed my hen do

36:42.920 --> 36:44.840
and told me it was Marcus
that leaked the tape.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.360
Yeah.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.640
And he let David take the blame.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.240
So, why did she...

36:53.840 --> 36:54.880
come to you?

36:56.000 --> 36:57.400
Was she blackmailing him?

36:58.920 --> 37:00.240
What?

37:00.320 --> 37:02.560
The woman, did she blackmail Marcus?

37:03.360 --> 37:06.360
He refused to pay
and so she told you everything?

37:07.720 --> 37:09.440
No, it wasn't about money.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.440
Uh...

37:10.520 --> 37:12.680
She never asked for a penny off him.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.040
No. No, just hear me out.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.160
Are you thick or what? I'm not interested
in anything you have to say.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.000
You should be, 'cause you have no idea!

37:19.400 --> 37:21.760
You have no idea

37:21.840 --> 37:25.480
how many lives I've seen destroyed
by selfish, evil people like him.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.880
Are you really gonna marry this man?

37:31.800 --> 37:33.480
Look, I don't usually do this.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.720
But I'm speaking from experience.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.600
My mother married the wrong man
and it cost me my entire life.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.000
Is that what you want for your children?

37:47.400 --> 37:48.880
Do you know where they went?

37:49.960 --> 37:52.920
No idea. She left after I told her
I'm not leaving Marcus.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.160
You're still gonna marry him?

37:54.240 --> 37:56.480
Well, you don't think I'm doing this shit
for fun, do you?

37:56.560 --> 37:58.080
I wanna look good for my wedding day.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.200
No offense,
but he sounds like a psycho to me.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.120
Well, there's a fine line
between love and madness.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.000
I don't expect everyone to get it.

38:06.760 --> 38:07.600
Get what?

38:08.240 --> 38:11.120
Marcus did what he did
because he wanted me for himself.

38:11.720 --> 38:15.760
He was desperate to be with me.
Who doesn't wanna be loved that much?

38:16.520 --> 38:18.840
So madly, so passionately,

38:18.920 --> 38:20.960
that they'll risk everything.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.160
Does your wife love you that way?

38:28.680 --> 38:30.280
I love you so much.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.000
Anything from Mom?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.200
No. Just, um...

38:54.080 --> 38:55.240
It's a phone bill.

38:56.440 --> 38:58.320
If you knew where she went,
you would tell us?

38:59.720 --> 39:01.560
Thomas, I have told you.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.280
Look, mate...

39:06.040 --> 39:07.640
I was gonna order something for dinner.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.960
What do you fancy?

39:09.040 --> 39:10.920
Why can't you just be honest with me?

39:50.560 --> 39:51.920
Has Mom called you?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.400
No. You?

39:55.040 --> 39:55.880
No.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.200
I don't get it.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.520
She always wants to know where we are.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.400
-Give me your phone.
-Piss off.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.640
I'm being serious.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.600
Remember last year
when you bunked off school

40:08.680 --> 40:10.480
to go to that charity football game?

40:10.560 --> 40:11.680
Yeah.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.560
Mom knew where you were

40:13.640 --> 40:16.120
'cause of that messaging location app.

40:16.840 --> 40:20.280
You took it off your phone
but if we downloaded it again,

40:20.360 --> 40:22.120
we could find out where she is.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.320
<i>Well?</i>

41:16.600 --> 41:17.480
What the...?

41:17.560 --> 41:19.280
She's two miles away.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.040
In town.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.360
Heidi?
