04:09.617 --> 04:11.350
Yeah. That'd be me.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.651

well, this package...

04:12.653 --> 04:14.553
[paper rustles]

04:15.856 --> 04:17.022

04:17.024 --> 04:19.258

Well, it's all yours,

04:21.261 --> 04:23.261
if I can just get you
to sign right there.

04:23.998 --> 04:25.764
You're a godsend.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.531
If you hadn't turned up today,
it would have been too late.

04:27.534 --> 04:30.435
[messenger chuckles]
I knew that.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.537
-Why do you think I'm here now?
-[chuckles]

04:32.539 --> 04:33.872
There you go.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.641

-Thank you.

04:35.643 --> 04:36.708
...whatever was so important.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.976
I will. Thank you.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.011
[messenger] Thank you.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.581
[ominous music]

04:51.425 --> 04:54.993
Humanity has had
the oddest habit

04:54.995 --> 04:56.695
of turning a blind eye

04:56.697 --> 04:58.430
to anything
that makes it uneasy.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.668
In 1634, Galileo was declared

05:02.670 --> 05:04.770
a heretic for daring to suggest

05:04.772 --> 05:07.572
that it was, in fact, the Earth
that revolved around the Sun

05:07.574 --> 05:09.875
and not the other way round.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.910
And even though
this was one of the most

05:11.912 --> 05:14.613
strongly supported facts
ever disclosed,

05:14.615 --> 05:18.417
that assertion cost him
not only his reputation,

05:18.419 --> 05:20.886
but it also cut him off
from society

05:20.888 --> 05:23.088
right up until the day he died.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.323
For centuries,

05:24.325 --> 05:26.058
thousands upon thousands
of people

05:26.060 --> 05:28.960
have experienced UFO sightings

05:28.962 --> 05:33.031
and various forms of encounters
with extraterrestrials.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.034
Even over 3,000 years ago,

05:36.036 --> 05:39.037
the Mayans depicted
some of these occurrences

05:39.039 --> 05:41.106
in their wall carvings.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.541
But, of course,

05:42.542 --> 05:43.975
it wasn't until
the advent of photography

05:43.977 --> 05:46.078
towards the end
of the 19th century

05:46.080 --> 05:49.114
that we were able
to actually record proof.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.616
Physical proof
of these sightings.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.722
But that was never
gonna be enough.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.392
What with our ingrained
mockery and dupery,

06:00.394 --> 06:02.694
which gave way
to incessant suspicion

06:02.696 --> 06:04.930
and dogma,

06:04.931 --> 06:07.165
which, of course, cast such
an enormous shadow of doubt

06:07.167 --> 06:09.101
-all over this proof.
-[telephone ringing]

06:09.970 --> 06:12.637
At least for those...

06:12.639 --> 06:15.107
<i> -who chose to turn...</i>
-Hello?

06:15.109 --> 06:16.609
-<i> ...a blind eye.</i>
-[Sara's mom]<i> Hi, Sara.</i>

06:16.610 --> 06:18.110
-<i> It's just your mom calling.</i>
-[Sara] Hi, Mom.

06:18.112 --> 06:20.545
-How are you?
-<i> I'm fine.</i>

06:20.547 --> 06:22.881
Listen, the reason
I'm calling is...

06:22.883 --> 06:25.751
I wondered if you may be free
to come over for lunch tomorrow?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.186
Oh, are you serious?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.722
You know I can't.
I'm going away, you know that.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.857
[Sara's mom]<i> Sorry, love.</i>

06:31.859 --> 06:34.092
Yes, you did tell me.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.661
I don't know why, I was certain
that was next week.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.196
Oh, no, Mom. It's this weekend.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.066
[Sara's mom]<i> Couldn't</i>
<i> someone else from the office</i>

06:41.068 --> 06:43.468
at least go with you
to keep you company?

06:43.470 --> 06:45.170
Mom, can we not do this again?

06:45.172 --> 06:47.739
You know, this not work-related.
This is for my book.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.408
I know, Sara.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.710
[Sara]<i> Mom,</i>
<i> are you hearing yourself?</i>

06:51.712 --> 06:53.879
We're not in the 20s
anymore, okay?

06:53.881 --> 06:55.714
Women can travel
around the world by themselves.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.549
You really need
to accept that already.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.717
[Sara's mom]<i> You watch</i>
<i> your tone, young lady!</i>

06:58.719 --> 07:01.119
This is your mother
you're talking to.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.654
And you make it sound
like I was around

07:02.656 --> 07:03.922
when dinosaurs ruled the earth.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.226
You are so like your father.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.495
[slurps]

07:12.199 --> 07:13.865
Mom, please tell me
you're not drinking again.

07:13.867 --> 07:14.933
'Course not!

07:16.670 --> 07:18.203
[sharp inhale]
Anyway...

07:19.673 --> 07:20.939
I wasn't gonna bring this up.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.110
But I was speaking to your aunt,

07:25.112 --> 07:27.212
and she said she read
all kinds of weird stories

07:27.214 --> 07:29.181
<i> about that place</i>
<i> you're so intent on visiting.</i>

07:29.183 --> 07:31.016

07:31.018 --> 07:33.051
[Sara's mom]<i> Well, you do</i>
<i> whatever you think you should!</i>

07:33.053 --> 07:34.386
[soft grunt]

07:34.387 --> 07:35.720

<i> as soon as you get there,</i>
<i> though, right?</i>

07:37.491 --> 07:38.568
No, Mom.

07:38.569 --> 07:39.646
There's no signal in the forest,

07:39.647 --> 07:40.724
and I'm pretty sure
there's no Wi-Fi, either.

07:40.727 --> 07:41.693
Okay?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.795
[sighs]

07:43.797 --> 07:45.263
You know what?
I'll... I'll call you

07:45.265 --> 07:47.132
as soon as I get home
on Monday, okay?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.200
All right. Okay.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.270
But please promise me
you'll be careful with the car.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.672
Oh, yes, Mom.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.973
Okay? I'll talk to you soon.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.141
All right. Bye. I love you.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.052
We can only hope that this time,

08:41.054 --> 08:43.288
unlike what happened
with Galileo,

08:43.290 --> 08:46.024
we won't have to wait
all of 300 years

08:46.026 --> 08:47.926
to authenticate the veracity

08:47.928 --> 08:51.663
of the unmitigated proof

I just about
had enough of it, Joe.

choose not to hibernate.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.428
Yeah, well,
I had no other choice.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.297
Some guy on the phone
gave me strict instructions.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.441
Uh, sometimes people
are too smart

14:03.443 --> 14:04.876
for their own good,

14:04.877 --> 14:06.310
and they only realize
once it's too late.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.314
Yeah, I got you.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.182
We need to know
when people are gonna be here,

14:11.184 --> 14:14.018
so we can be around
to keep watch over you.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.054
Contrary to what
most people believe,

14:16.056 --> 14:18.656
the biggest obstacle
isn't getting in here.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.992
It's getting out...

14:22.262 --> 14:23.494
alive.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.163
Yeah. The bears?

14:25.165 --> 14:26.564
Exactly.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.600
Yeah. I saw the commotion
on the river bank.

14:28.602 --> 14:29.667
[chuckles]

14:29.669 --> 14:32.070
[thunder rumbling]

14:32.072 --> 14:33.137
[Sara] Well, I hope
the man upstairs

14:33.139 --> 14:35.006
doesn't give us any problems.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.876
I think we'll be okay.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.645
[Joe] But we're gonna start
inside, so...

14:40.647 --> 14:42.080
you don't have anything
to worry about.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.148
Great!

14:44.150 --> 14:45.516
What do you say
we do this already?

14:45.518 --> 14:46.651
I'll follow you.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.356
So, what do you think
of this so far?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.325
[Sara] It's amazing.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.927
Can't wait to get inside.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.448
[Joe chuckles]

14:59.449 --> 15:01.266
Something tells me you're not
gonna be disappointed.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.001
[Sara chuckles]

15:03.536 --> 15:05.603
[calm music]

15:17.083 --> 15:18.616
[bird screeching]

15:29.562 --> 15:32.096
Humans need something
to hold onto, you know?

15:32.098 --> 15:33.164
And when it's something
you can't

15:33.166 --> 15:34.299
quite get your head round...

15:34.701 --> 15:36.184
[chuckles]

15:36.185 --> 15:37.668
...you take your own ignorance
as the truth.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.270
[Sara chuckles]

15:39.272 --> 15:41.706
Well, that's a lovely
philosophy, Joe.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.541
But there must have been
documented cases

15:43.543 --> 15:46.044
of sightings and contact
before what happened.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.362
Well, sure.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.679
But there's no actual proof
of anything

15:48.682 --> 15:50.148
from the moment
the barracks were built

15:50.150 --> 15:52.050
until they were abandoned.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.384
Official records, you mean?

15:53.386 --> 15:54.986
Well, yeah.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.654
I couldn't tell you
about anything off the record.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.125
Although, I guess
I gotta warn you,

16:01.127 --> 16:03.561
strange things still happen here
now and again.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.497
[both laugh]

16:06.499 --> 16:08.299
[creature snarling]

16:08.768 --> 16:10.668
[chittering]

16:12.105 --> 16:13.338
Shit.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.273
[Sara mumbles]

16:15.275 --> 16:16.341
-What's going on?
-[cocks gun]

16:16.343 --> 16:17.542
Okay, just keep quiet.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.410
What?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.145
Oh, my god.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.084
[creature snarling]

16:26.086 --> 16:30.054
Okay, Sara just do exactly
as I say.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.222
-Okay?
-Okay.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.559
[Joe] Now, on three,

16:34.561 --> 16:36.794
I want you to run out
of the forest as fast as you can

16:36.796 --> 16:38.029
towards the barracks,

16:38.031 --> 16:39.097
as if your life depended on it.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.782
Wait. What about you?

16:40.783 --> 16:42.466
No, don't ask questions now,
for god's sake, Sara.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.335
Okay? Just run.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.137
And no matter what you hear,

16:46.139 --> 16:48.573
don't look back. You hear me?

16:48.575 --> 16:51.342
-No looking back.
-Okay. Okay.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.510
[exhales sharply]

16:52.512 --> 16:53.644
One...

16:53.646 --> 16:56.180
-[breathes deeply]
-Two...

16:57.684 --> 16:59.617
Three. Run, Sara! Run!

16:59.619 --> 17:01.686
[Sara panting]

17:02.422 --> 17:04.322
Fuck. Fuck, fuck!

17:05.158 --> 17:07.592
[Sara panting]

17:08.328 --> 17:09.360
[Sara grunts]

17:10.030 --> 17:11.095
[Sara] Help!

17:14.634 --> 17:16.067
Help!

17:16.069 --> 17:18.102
[suspenseful music]

17:21.107 --> 17:22.206
Come on!

17:22.208 --> 17:23.374
Come out here!

17:23.376 --> 17:24.675
You don't get the balls, do you?

17:27.814 --> 17:30.048
Couldn't you have picked
a better time?

17:30.050 --> 17:31.716
Can't you see we've got guests?

17:32.786 --> 17:34.485
[creature snarling]

17:34.487 --> 17:35.553
[Joe] Come on! Come out here!

17:36.523 --> 17:39.057
Where the hell are you?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.491
You still haven't learned
who makes the fucking rules

17:40.493 --> 17:41.592
around here, have you?

17:45.865 --> 17:48.699
[creature snarling]

17:50.637 --> 17:53.204
-[gunshots]
-[Sara pants]

17:53.206 --> 17:55.373
[Sara] Oh, god. Oh, god.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.742
[Sara panting]

18:03.516 --> 18:05.583
[ominous music]

18:08.721 --> 18:10.121
[Sara groans]

18:10.123 --> 18:11.189
[Sara] Shit.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.224
[Sara panting]

18:20.900 --> 18:22.633
[whimpering]

18:23.636 --> 18:24.702
[man 2 grunts]

18:24.704 --> 18:26.771
[thrilling music]

18:29.576 --> 18:30.641
Oh, my god!

18:32.312 --> 18:33.511
[Joe] You're a

18:33.513 --> 18:34.846
-fucking savage bastard!
-Joe! Joe!

18:34.847 --> 18:36.180
-Joe! Watch out, watch out!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:36.182 --> 18:37.882
-[Joe] Jesus, what the fuck...
-[Sara screams]

18:37.884 --> 18:39.250
Jesus, Ed!

18:39.252 --> 18:40.318
What?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.255
You know him?

18:44.257 --> 18:46.724
Yeah, of course, I do.
Everybody does. It's Ed.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.292
-[Sara panting]
-Didn't I mention him earlier?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.228
No. No, you didn't.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.931
Oh. Well, he's as weird
as they come, but...

18:53.933 --> 18:55.666
his heart is in the right place,
isn't it, buddy?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.302
[Ed mumbling]

18:58.304 --> 18:59.403
[Joe groans]

18:59.405 --> 19:01.672
-[Sara] Jesus, Joe!
-[Joe] Yeah.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.875
I caught it on the iron rails
on the fence.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.810
We need to get you
to a hospital!

19:05.812 --> 19:06.911
It's nothing.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.446
[Ed babbling]

19:10.150 --> 19:11.549
-[Ed grunts]
-[Sara] What...

19:11.551 --> 19:12.650
[Joe] Yeah, all right.
Whatever you say.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.168
[Sara] Where's he going?

19:14.169 --> 19:15.685
[Joe] Uh, he's got
a first aid kit in his hut.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.755
He's gonna stitch it up for me.
Come on!

19:17.757 --> 19:19.824
[Sara] You're joking, right?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.192
[Joe] No.
[chuckles]

19:21.194 --> 19:22.593
It's not the first time, either.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.162
These sort of things happen
all the time.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.831
Come on!

19:26.833 --> 19:28.299
[Sara] He lives down there?

19:28.301 --> 19:29.667
[Joe] No, of course not.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.269
He lives in a caravan
in the forest,

19:31.271 --> 19:33.371
on the other side
of the barracks.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.239
But if we go this way,

19:35.241 --> 19:36.374
we avoid having to deal

19:36.376 --> 19:38.376
with that friend
of ours outside again.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.677
[Sara] Yeah.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.946
And we're just gonna
go down there, just like that?

19:41.948 --> 19:44.749
[Joe chuckles]
Come on.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.751
It'll be more fun this way.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.252
Yeah.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.288
[eerie music]

19:57.363 --> 20:00.565
[approaching footsteps]

20:00.567 --> 20:03.367
[Joe] You could say Ed's
the real keeper of this castle.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.971
[chuckles]
He scares prying eyes away.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.773
Even the damn bears
are scared of him.

20:10.476 --> 20:13.411
[Sara] But... What is he?
Mute or something?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.947
Uh, not exactly.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.415
He's just...
[sighs]

20:17.417 --> 20:19.483
...not the most talkative
of people.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.718
But he's quite the erudite.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.886
[Joe] You'll see.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.895
Here's where
the officer's rooms were.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.631
And at the far end,

20:33.633 --> 20:35.466
Command and Captaincy offices.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.737
[creature chittering]

20:46.946 --> 20:48.512
And why was there a nursery?

20:49.315 --> 20:51.382
Oh.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.450
Some of the higher officers
lived here with their families.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.822
[Joe] There were stories

20:57.824 --> 21:00.524
about how women became
more fertile in this forest.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.761
It was a pretty productive time
for some of them.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.996
[Sara chuckles]
Yeah.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.832
[camera shutter clicks]

21:09.402 --> 21:10.568
[Joe] Come on.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.802
You're gonna like this.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.709
[creature chitters]

21:31.591 --> 21:33.658
[foreboding music]

21:38.531 --> 21:40.765
[Ed babbling]

21:40.767 --> 21:42.600
[Joe] Ah, leave it out,
will you?

21:42.602 --> 21:43.834
Let me show her.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.469
Come on.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.104
[Joe grunts]

21:50.843 --> 21:52.310
[Sara] What's his problem now?

21:52.312 --> 21:53.377
Ah, nothing.

21:53.379 --> 21:55.913
He's just
over meticulous is all.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.349
[Joe] See?

21:58.351 --> 22:00.318
This was how they got
to the higher floors.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.720
[Joe groans]

22:04.023 --> 22:05.523
Up there was the library,

22:05.525 --> 22:06.757
the living room,
and the bedrooms

22:06.759 --> 22:08.392
for the noncommissioned
officers.

22:08.394 --> 22:09.560
[Ed growls]

22:09.562 --> 22:10.961
[Sara] And down there?

22:10.963 --> 22:12.096
Hell.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.131
[scoffs]

22:14.133 --> 22:15.533
That actually
wouldn't surprise me.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.767
[chuckles]

22:16.769 --> 22:19.070
Yeah, well,
the gateway at least.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.138
Dr. Marshall's
molecular biology lab

22:21.140 --> 22:23.407
and the weapons tunnel
were on the lower floors.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.976
And...

22:25.978 --> 22:28.512
if you stick your head in there
for a few seconds,

22:28.514 --> 22:30.915
you can still hear the screams
of the long-lost souls

22:30.917 --> 22:32.350
who were trapped down there.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.420
You're making fun of me,
aren't you?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.156
You be the judge.

22:41.394 --> 22:42.426
[Sara scoffs]

22:45.832 --> 22:46.964
[groans]

22:46.966 --> 22:51.135
[woman 2 screaming]

22:51.137 --> 22:52.570
Oh, my god, Joe.

22:52.572 --> 22:53.671
What the hell is that?

22:55.074 --> 22:57.408
I told you weird things
still happen around here.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.096
Dude, what's really down there?

23:02.097 --> 23:03.780
'Cause if you're not making
this up, I'm leaving right now.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.683
[Ed grumbles]

23:05.685 --> 23:07.585
Yeah, right, we're coming.
Keep your hat on.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.655
He wants us to get a move on,
but pay no attention.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.759
Well, true or not,

23:14.761 --> 23:16.627
it's probably not the best idea

23:16.629 --> 23:19.029
to be walking around here
on your own.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.565
[Joe] But I will put you
out of your misery,

23:21.567 --> 23:23.434
and I will tell you what it is.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.069
[Sara] Yeah, something
that makes sense, please.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.071
-[Joe chuckles]
-[Sara] I'm serious!

23:28.207 --> 23:30.574
And by the way,

23:30.576 --> 23:32.576
do you really understand
everything that he says?

23:33.146 --> 23:34.445
[Joe] Um...

23:35.415 --> 23:37.081
How do I explain this?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.149
Let me break it down.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.918
Have you ever had a dog?

23:40.920 --> 23:43.053
[Sara] Yeah, when I was a kid.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.121
-Chewie.
-[Joe chuckles]

23:44.123 --> 23:45.456
[Sara] He was part
of the family.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.591
[Joe] Okay.
And even though Chewie,

23:47.593 --> 23:49.026
all he ever did was bark,

23:49.028 --> 23:51.562
you still understood
everything he said, right?

23:51.564 --> 23:52.730
-[Sara] Yeah.
-[Joe chuckles]

23:52.732 --> 23:53.864
[Joe] Exactly!

23:53.866 --> 23:55.433
Well, imagine if you've had

23:55.435 --> 23:57.968
a chance to share
a couple of beers with him.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.037
I'm sure
your canine communication skills

24:00.039 --> 24:01.572
would have reached
all new levels.

24:01.574 --> 24:02.857
[chuckles]

24:02.858 --> 24:04.141
Well, I never thought
about it like that.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.209
[both chuckle]

24:05.211 --> 24:07.178
That's what I was trying
to say earlier.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.314
More often than not,

24:09.315 --> 24:11.449
the truth is actually a lot
less complicated than it seems.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.550
[Joe] You see,

24:12.552 --> 24:14.018
that's what I was
getting at earlier

24:14.020 --> 24:15.619
when we talked
about all those rumors

24:15.621 --> 24:16.954
that were flying around.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.022
[Sara] Yeah. And...

24:18.024 --> 24:19.690
What about those cries
we just heard?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.225
[Joe chuckles]
Exactly.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.927
What about those cries?

24:22.929 --> 24:24.796
[Sara gasps]

24:24.797 --> 24:26.664
That's just the sound
of the north wind blowing

24:26.666 --> 24:29.099
through the ventilation ducts
on the lower levels.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.935
[Sara] Well, that scared
the shit out of me.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.170
[Joe chuckles]

24:33.172 --> 24:35.573
[Joe] Imagination can be
a man's worst friend.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.808
Isn't that right, Ed?

24:38.578 --> 24:40.644
[ominous music]

24:41.581 --> 24:42.913
[Ed babbles]

24:45.017 --> 24:47.585
[babbling continues]

24:47.587 --> 24:48.986
[Sara] Time to visit
the underworld, then?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.888
[Joe] Uh, not yet.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.991
This is an exit
that leads directly outside.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.294
-[plane whirring on TV]
-[Sara scoffs]

24:57.296 --> 24:59.797
[presenter]<i> The Tetis Region</i>
<i> was one of the hot spots</i>

24:59.799 --> 25:02.800
<i> where various UFO activity</i>
<i> was witnessed,</i>

25:02.802 --> 25:06.270
<i> following the Cosmic Call</i>
<i> as a result of the power burst</i>

25:06.272 --> 25:10.608
<i> caused by the Hiroshima</i>
<i> and Nagasaki bombs.</i>

25:10.610 --> 25:15.679
<i> One of the most bizarre</i>
<i> UFO occurrences ever recorded</i>

25:15.681 --> 25:18.516
<i> took place right here.</i>

25:18.518 --> 25:21.752
<i> On October 15th, 1946,</i>

25:21.754 --> 25:24.655
a manned alien ship crashed

25:24.657 --> 25:27.992
in the rocky mountain range
you can see behind me.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.227
The military swiftly moved in,

25:30.229 --> 25:33.864
a 25-kilometer radius
extending from the crash site

25:33.866 --> 25:36.567
was declared
off-limits to civilians.

25:36.569 --> 25:40.871
It was impossible to gain access
to this forest

25:40.873 --> 25:43.741
for the four decades

25:43.742 --> 25:46.610
that the now abandoned
military reserve was operating.

25:46.612 --> 25:49.346
But, on that October evening,

25:49.348 --> 25:52.750
before the military even arrived
on the scene,

25:52.752 --> 25:57.187
a local witnessed the event,
and he took a photograph.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.223
[suspenseful music]

26:01.160 --> 26:04.061
That photograph
was published in the media,

26:04.063 --> 26:06.130
which caused
the government to launch

26:06.132 --> 26:11.802
a relentless campaign rejecting
and debunking the proof.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.805
Now, in the photograph
taken by the civilian,

26:14.807 --> 26:18.142
we can see the image
of the flying saucer

26:18.144 --> 26:23.013
and two human-shaped figures
lying on the ground

26:23.015 --> 26:24.715
whose body measurements

26:24.717 --> 26:28.018
deviate considerably
from the human norm.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.354
The official version

26:30.356 --> 26:33.290
attributed the event
to a military jet,

26:33.292 --> 26:37.895
which crashed during training,
caused by rotational energy.

26:37.897 --> 26:42.266
Accordingly, society mourned
the death of these two pilots,

26:42.268 --> 26:43.867
whose charred cadavers

26:43.869 --> 26:46.870
were said to have been retrieved
near the fuselage.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.639
Hmm.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.941
[static]

26:50.943 --> 26:55.012
So, what became
of this third figure?

26:56.082 --> 26:57.281
[static]

26:57.283 --> 26:59.416
[frog croaking]

26:59.418 --> 27:01.185
[Joe] When they wake up
after the winter lethargy,

27:01.187 --> 27:02.820
they have one hell
of an appetite

27:02.822 --> 27:05.155
and are seriously
sexually active.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.024
It's their mating season,
so they turn aggressive

27:07.026 --> 27:08.993
because of how few
females there are.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.229
And why are there
so few females?

27:12.231 --> 27:13.764
[Joe chuckles]

27:13.766 --> 27:15.799
I guess we'll have to ask
the man upstairs.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.387
[Joe] The thing is, they think

27:19.388 --> 27:21.372
they're the fucking kings
of the jungle, you know?

27:21.374 --> 27:23.073
No respect for us humans.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.175

Come over to me. It's okay.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.062
Come over here.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.465

27:50.002 --> 27:51.101
Your friend's back.

-It's gonna be okay, I swear.

27:59.278 --> 28:00.344

didn't you, you bastard?

28:12.725 --> 28:14.358
-Huh?
-[frog croaks]

28:14.360 --> 28:16.060
Well, you're gonna be in trouble
if he finds out.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.228
[creature squishing]

28:18.230 --> 28:19.830
You're done for, you hear me?

28:19.832 --> 28:21.031
You're done for!

Oh, my god, Joe.

29:03.809 --> 29:04.975
I thought you
weren't coming back.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.043
[Joe] I'm okay. Don't worry.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.278
Okay.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.379
Now this...

29:09.381 --> 29:11.181
this they do
show little respect to.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.184
I think it's run off home.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.454
-Ed!
-[Ed groans]

29:17.456 --> 29:19.323

out now, buddy.

-[Joe] Jesus, Ed.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.917
Leave it!

29:29.918 --> 29:31.501
Ed, I know what you're like,
and you'll both get hurt.

-[creature screeches]

29:37.209 --> 29:40.010
-Same as always!
-[Ed mumbles]

29:40.012 --> 29:41.478
Yeah, you can do
all the explaining later, huh?

29:41.480 --> 29:43.514
[Ed groans]

29:43.516 --> 29:44.782
-[door slams]
-[Sara gasps]

29:46.051 --> 29:47.785
-Is he going to kill it?
-No.

29:48.788 --> 29:51.021
Well, at least I hope not.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.924
He's gonna teach it a lesson
in his own particular way.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.058
Shouldn't you go with him?

29:56.262 --> 29:57.427
Well...

29:58.130 --> 29:59.963
Oh. No hurry.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.535
Do you want me
to help you with...

30:04.537 --> 30:05.903
Mmm, no.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.271
[laughs]
It's okay. Thanks.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.074
[Joe] Um, I can probably do
a brushing up

30:11.076 --> 30:12.976
of my sewing skills
after last time.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.012
[eerie music]

30:21.020 --> 30:22.152
[Joe sighs]

30:22.154 --> 30:24.154
Joe, can I take... a look?

30:24.156 --> 30:26.156
Yeah, yeah, of course.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.542
While the cat's away.

30:28.543 --> 30:30.927
I mean, Ed doesn't really like
people meddling with his stuff.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.273
You said, Dr. Marshal
was in charge of the lab, right?

30:43.275 --> 30:45.409
Yep, he was.
[groans]

30:45.978 --> 30:47.044
And...

30:48.514 --> 30:49.580
[grunts]

30:49.582 --> 30:50.881
...he was Ed's dad.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.483
He was what now?

30:53.485 --> 30:56.286
[chuckles]
Yeah. You heard me.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.488
Ed was born and bred
in these here woods.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.924
He's oblivious to the world
outside the forest.

31:00.926 --> 31:01.992
Hence, his...

31:02.294 --> 31:03.777
[grunts]

31:03.778 --> 31:05.261
...kindred relationship
with the wildlife.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.565
[Joe sighs]

31:11.370 --> 31:13.437
[Joe] Everyone just assumed
he disappeared

31:13.439 --> 31:15.439
in the explosion that...
[grunts]

31:15.441 --> 31:16.506
...killed his parents

31:16.508 --> 31:18.342
and destroyed
the military barracks.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.044
But he was hiding in the woods,

31:21.046 --> 31:22.412
and grew up
living like a caveman.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.182
But what about his family?

31:25.184 --> 31:28.452
Didn't he have
uncles or grandparents?

31:29.288 --> 31:31.021
[Sara] Someone?

31:31.023 --> 31:33.156
[Joe grunts]
Yeah.

31:33.158 --> 31:34.658
I guess there must've
been someone,

31:36.028 --> 31:38.262
but this was
the only world he knew.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.666
[Joe grunts]

31:44.970 --> 31:46.069

[grunts]

32:00.085 --> 32:01.218
Yeah.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.619
I guess he just
didn't wanna leave

32:02.621 --> 32:05.088
his memories behind, you know?

32:05.090 --> 32:08.392
And he probably felt
it was his responsibility

32:08.394 --> 32:09.927
to carry on his dad's work.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.595
Can I take a look?

32:12.264 --> 32:13.497
[chuckles]

with a scientific bent, too?

32:16.669 --> 32:17.734
Yeah, of course.

No secrets here.

[sniffles]

35:24.523 --> 35:25.755
I couldn't find you anywhere.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.542
What?

35:28.543 --> 35:30.393
Uh, I walked past here
like ten minutes ago

35:30.395 --> 35:31.461
-and you weren't here.
-[sighs]

35:31.463 --> 35:33.663
I don't know where you were.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.298
-[grunts]
-What I'm saying is,

35:35.300 --> 35:37.234
I think we've just experienced
an encounter...

35:38.537 --> 35:40.403
-of the fourth fucking kind.
-Fuck.

35:40.405 --> 35:41.571
[Joe] Do you know
what that means?

35:41.573 --> 35:43.573
An abduction!
[gasps]

35:43.575 --> 35:45.208
-[groaning]
-[Joe] Oh! Whoa, whoa.

35:45.210 --> 35:46.543
-[yelling]
-Whoa. Whoa.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.912
-What is it?
-Oh, my god. I don't know.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.380
[Sara] Oh, that hurts!

35:51.683 --> 35:53.517
-Oh!
-Joe.

35:53.519 --> 35:55.152
What the fuck is this?

35:55.154 --> 35:57.220
-Oh, my...
-Oh, my... Oh, my god.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.189
Oh, my...

35:59.191 --> 36:00.323
I'm gonna try again.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.861
Zenith to Base, do you copy?

36:07.399 --> 36:09.166
Zenith to Base, do you copy?

36:09.801 --> 36:10.867
Fuck!

36:10.869 --> 36:13.637
Fuck! Fucking technology!

36:13.639 --> 36:15.472
I've tried, like, 20 times
and nothing. It's fried.

36:17.709 --> 36:18.875
What happened to Ed?

36:19.545 --> 36:21.178
I don't know.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.812
I lost track of him
after the gunshots.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.447
I can't remember anything else.

36:24.449 --> 36:25.682
I woke up back over there.

36:27.252 --> 36:28.318
And, Sara...

36:29.655 --> 36:31.388
there's a mark on my ankle, too.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.393
[Sara] You too!

36:38.630 --> 36:40.797
We've got to get out of here,
we're way too exposed.

36:40.799 --> 36:41.932
-Okay.
-Okay.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.734
[groaning]

36:46.305 --> 36:47.404
[grunts]

36:48.540 --> 36:51.274
-Okay.
-[panting]

36:51.276 --> 36:52.876
-I know somewhere safer.
-Okay.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.612
Wait! Wait, wait.

36:55.614 --> 36:56.947
Where's my camera?

36:56.949 --> 36:58.014
Where's my camera?

36:58.016 --> 36:59.549
I got it, I got it, I got it.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.485
[groaning]

37:02.487 --> 37:03.753
-[Joe] Hey.
-[whimpers]

37:06.858 --> 37:08.291
[Joe] We've gotta go back
to the barracks.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.326
[Sara grunts]
Okay.

37:11.263 --> 37:13.597
[Sara groaning]

37:13.599 --> 37:14.965
[alien chitters]

37:15.934 --> 37:17.968

38:00.379 --> 38:01.678
[Joe and Sara grunting]

38:01.680 --> 38:02.946
-[Joe] It's okay.
-[Sara groans]

38:02.948 --> 38:04.881
-Come on.
-[Sara gasping]

38:07.819 --> 38:09.286
-Okay.
-[whimpers]

38:09.288 --> 38:10.320
Just rest here.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.323
-[Sara groans]
-Okay.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.591
[whimpers]

38:15.427 --> 38:16.493
[both grunt]

38:17.696 --> 38:19.929
Okay.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.999
Just try and relax,
and wait for me here, okay?

38:23.001 --> 38:24.067
[sighs]
Joe.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.302
I'm gonna go check it out first.

38:25.304 --> 38:26.536
Please, please be careful,
please?

38:26.538 --> 38:28.438
[sobbing]

38:28.440 --> 38:29.506
Hey.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.508
It's okay.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.609
Yeah?

38:32.611 --> 38:33.843
I'll be literally two minutes.

38:36.048 --> 38:38.815
[sobbing]

38:44.323 --> 38:45.422
[groans]

38:45.757 --> 38:46.890
Fuck.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.826
The fuck have you done to me?

38:50.762 --> 38:53.930
[groans, panting]

38:57.903 --> 38:59.069
Must have dropped it.

38:59.905 --> 39:00.970
[groans]

39:00.972 --> 39:02.138
[alien chittering]

39:02.140 --> 39:03.340

39:04.710 --> 39:06.009
[groans]

39:06.011 --> 39:08.978
[alien snarling]

39:10.916 --> 39:12.015
Hello?

39:13.151 --> 39:14.584
Hello?
[sobs]

39:19.524 --> 39:20.990
Shit.

39:20.992 --> 39:22.158
[mutters]

39:23.562 --> 39:24.627
Fuck.

39:24.629 --> 39:26.563
[breathes heavily]

39:26.565 --> 39:28.832
[calm music]

39:28.834 --> 39:30.367
[bird cawing]

39:32.404 --> 39:33.703
[Will]<i> All right,</i>
<i> here we are again.</i>

39:33.705 --> 39:35.138
[Sam]<i> I know. On the way.</i>

39:35.140 --> 39:37.574
[Will clicks tongue]
[Will]<i> I hate these bumps.</i>

39:37.576 --> 39:39.609
I hate that there's bumps
in the middle of the road.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.878
[Sam] Some people like you
will slow down.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.880
-[Will] I always slow down.
-[Sam] Yeah, I know.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.049
I just think
that we take things for granted.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.384
You know, it's as if

39:47.386 --> 39:48.685
people think
they're gonna live forever,

39:48.687 --> 39:50.019
but that's not the case.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.588
-[Will] What?
-I mean, things can end

39:51.590 --> 39:52.655
at any moment.

39:52.657 --> 39:54.307
And take us, for example.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.958
I mean, there's a purpose
for why we're in this car.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.494
Yeah, of course,
there's a reason.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.162
We went
to the same school together.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.164
Oh, stop being a shithead, Will.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.900
I mean, I read about this
in one of those self-help books,

40:03.902 --> 40:06.836
and it says that it's nothing
but a simple countdown.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.505
You read way too much.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.040
-[radio chatter]
-[chuckles]

40:11.042 --> 40:13.510
Every day wasted
is like a slap in the face

40:13.512 --> 40:15.445
-to your dreams.
-What...

40:15.447 --> 40:17.113
[Sara]<i> Hello?</i>

40:17.115 --> 40:18.848
What's going on?

40:18.850 --> 40:20.650
[Sam] It is, and while
there's no predicting it,

40:20.652 --> 40:23.653
our time here can run out
when least expected.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.188
Bullshit, woman!
[laughs]

40:25.190 --> 40:27.023
What do you mean "bullshit"?

40:27.025 --> 40:28.658
Do you know
where my dreams start and end?

40:28.660 --> 40:29.726
[Sam] Where?

40:29.728 --> 40:32.312
On the sofa.

40:32.313 --> 40:34.897
Watching a game of football
and sipping an ice-cold beer.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.434
-[Sam] Hm.
-And I can tell right now,

40:37.436 --> 40:39.469
that's something
I'll never be late for.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.904
-[chuckles]
-Ah, you're hopeless.

40:41.606 --> 40:42.739
[Will mumbles]

40:42.741 --> 40:44.841
[Sara]<i> Hello... Hello?</i>

40:44.843 --> 40:46.643
-What's that?
-[Sara]<i> Can anybody hear me?</i>

40:46.645 --> 40:48.945
-Oh, fuck! Again.
-[radio chatter]

40:48.947 --> 40:50.547
[Sara]<i> ...encounter</i>

40:50.549 --> 40:51.681
<i> Help me!</i>

-[Will sighs]
-[Sara whimpers]

40:53.151 --> 40:55.084
[Sara]<i> Someone just help me,</i>

40:56.755 --> 40:57.921
<i> Help!</i>

40:57.923 --> 40:59.255
-<i> Joe!</i>
-Looks like those damned bears

40:59.257 --> 41:01.057
have gone too far this time.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.792
[Sam] Well, they don't seem
too concerned about it.

41:02.794 --> 41:03.993
They have the department.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.061
[Will sighs]

41:05.063 --> 41:06.129
Well, if it's up to me,

41:06.131 --> 41:09.466
I'd sort that shit out
right away.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.634
Base, this is 03,
do you read me?

41:14.539 --> 41:17.073
We have a possible code 86
out by the old barracks.

41:17.075 --> 41:18.875
Repeat. Possible code 86.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.176
How shall we proceed? Over.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.480
You know what?
Let's just head over there.

41:24.483 --> 41:25.648
That's good. Yeah.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.484
I'll enjoy catching
that cuddly toy.

41:27.486 --> 41:28.718
[chuckles]

41:28.720 --> 41:30.620
And when I do,

41:30.622 --> 41:32.188
I'll blow its brains out.

41:33.058 --> 41:35.258
[laughs]

41:35.260 --> 41:38.595
Base, this is 03,
awaiting instructions.

41:38.597 --> 41:39.729
[Sam] Do you read me?

41:41.533 --> 41:43.066
[officer]<i> Affirmative 03.</i>

41:43.068 --> 41:45.101
<i> Old barracks</i>

41:45.103 --> 41:46.503
<i> off-limits.</i>

41:46.505 --> 41:48.505

41:54.279 --> 41:55.912
[Sam] Copy that, base.
Standing down.

41:55.914 --> 41:57.731
What?

41:57.732 --> 41:59.549
We will proceed
with the normal route.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.653
You know, like I said, it's like
they don't give a shit.

42:03.655 --> 42:04.921
[sighs]

42:05.290 --> 42:07.056
Well, I...

42:07.058 --> 42:08.858
I don't... I don't know
if we should continue.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.543
What?

42:10.544 --> 42:12.227
If we don't go, they'll just
turn up when it's too late.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.830
Like they always do.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.734
Hey, you know
I'm always careful.

-Don't leave me alone.
-It's okay. It's okay.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.330
-[panting]
-You're okay. Yeah?

42:47.332 --> 42:51.134
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to find something, but...

42:51.136 --> 42:52.835
Let's go. Come on.
You can come with me.

42:54.072 --> 42:55.204
-It's okay.
-[groans]

42:57.609 --> 42:59.108

to attack me, Joe.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.810

Where are we going?

43:02.314 --> 43:04.113
Into hell, Sara.

43:04.115 --> 43:05.915
This time, for real.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.784
Are you sure
we're safer in there?

43:08.954 --> 43:09.986
I think so.

1:08:28.305 --> 1:08:31.606
It's okay. I'll be right there.
All right.

1:08:31.608 --> 1:08:33.308
-[presenter] Okay.
-[grunts]

1:08:33.310 --> 1:08:34.709
-We'll get you somewhere...

1:08:34.711 --> 1:08:36.411
-...somewhere safe.
-[crying]

1:08:36.413 --> 1:08:38.113
Some warm food.

[gasping]

1:08:55.265 --> 1:08:56.865
Look, I told you
it's gonna be okay, okay?

1:08:56.867 --> 1:08:57.899
Yeah.

1:08:59.269 --> 1:09:00.802
So, uh...

1:09:00.804 --> 1:09:03.238
Did you see the first episode
of the documentary, then?

1:09:04.708 --> 1:09:06.141
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:09:07.511 --> 1:09:08.676
What did you make of it?

1:09:11.815 --> 1:09:12.881
Great.

1:09:13.283 --> 1:09:14.349
Yeah.

1:09:14.351 --> 1:09:15.950
[chuckles]

1:09:15.952 --> 1:09:19.854
Good. 'Cause I've loved playing
with cameras ever since.

[presenter chuckling]

1:09:28.165 --> 1:09:29.430
Any day now, I see.

1:09:29.432 --> 1:09:30.732
[chuckling]

1:09:35.605 --> 1:09:36.671
You think?

1:09:37.340 --> 1:09:38.940
Yeah! Yeah!

1:09:39.843 --> 1:09:42.177
Yeah, it's a...

1:09:42.178 --> 1:09:44.512
It's amazing how fast they,
they grow nowadays.

1:09:45.815 --> 1:09:47.182
Well, you'll find out.
[chuckles]

1:09:50.420 --> 1:09:52.620
Oh, let me guess. Um...

1:09:52.622 --> 1:09:55.924
He told you that
you had been abducted, right?

1:09:55.926 --> 1:09:57.992
[stammers]
By aliens, no?

1:09:57.994 --> 1:09:59.394
[chuckles]

1:09:59.396 --> 1:10:02.197
Yeah! Of course, he did!
[snickers]

1:10:02.199 --> 1:10:05.333
Yeah, 'cause, man, he's
one fucking nasty piece of work,

1:10:05.335 --> 1:10:06.401
that fucking guy.

1:10:06.403 --> 1:10:07.602
He's a...
[mumbles]

1:10:07.604 --> 1:10:09.537
...a fucking goddamn hybrid!

1:10:09.539 --> 1:10:10.838
[snickers]

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:12.407
Yeah. Yeah.

1:10:12.409 --> 1:10:14.342
Now, with mother fucking helping

1:10:14.344 --> 1:10:16.744
on... on...
on boosting fertility.

1:10:16.746 --> 1:10:18.246
Ooh!

1:10:18.248 --> 1:10:21.216
He has his way with everything

1:10:21.218 --> 1:10:24.752
and anything that wanders out
into our little, whoo...

1:10:24.754 --> 1:10:26.588
neck of the woods.

-[Sara whimpering]
-[panting]

1:10:28.825 --> 1:10:31.392
I mean, just think about it.

1:10:31.394 --> 1:10:36.030
If we actually manage
to engender a, a female hybrid.

1:10:36.032 --> 1:10:37.599
Oh, god!

1:10:37.601 --> 1:10:40.235
I shudder to think what's next.

1:10:40.237 --> 1:10:41.903
A new species, Mama says.

1:10:41.905 --> 1:10:43.805
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Sara whimpers]

1:10:43.807 --> 1:10:45.740
"'Cause that was
your father's dream!

1:10:45.742 --> 1:10:47.976
Yeah, that was
your father's dream."

1:10:47.978 --> 1:10:49.577
Yeah, but that's
the fucking problem, you see?

1:10:49.579 --> 1:10:51.412
That's the fucking problem!

1:10:51.414 --> 1:10:53.548
Everybody is so fucking
wrapped up

1:10:53.550 --> 1:10:55.984
in their own
fucking dreams, right?

1:10:55.986 --> 1:10:57.819
And I'm telling you,
you have to be careful,

1:10:57.821 --> 1:10:59.587
you have to... you have to...

1:10:59.589 --> 1:11:01.990
you need to be careful
with what you wish for.

1:11:01.992 --> 1:11:03.758
[presenter]
Because if it comes true,

1:11:03.759 --> 1:11:05.525
and then you find out that it's
not what you actually wanted,

1:11:05.528 --> 1:11:06.861
and then, you're fucked.

1:11:06.863 --> 1:11:08.529
Then you're fucked.
That's it. It's over.

1:11:08.531 --> 1:11:10.398
[stutters]
And then, then what? Huh?

1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:11.916
Then what? Then...

1:11:11.917 --> 1:11:13.433
There's no turning back.
That's it. That's it.

1:11:13.436 --> 1:11:14.602
End of the story.

1:11:15.605 --> 1:11:18.373
I mean, fucking goddamn hybrid!

1:11:18.375 --> 1:11:20.475
Can you, can you imagine that?

1:11:20.477 --> 1:11:22.944
Oh, god. They'd be worse
than fucking humans, man.

1:11:22.946 --> 1:11:25.280
And the humans
are fucking bad enough as it is.

1:11:25.915 --> 1:11:27.382
Don't you think?

1:11:27.384 --> 1:11:28.950
Huh?
[chuckles]

1:11:30.654 --> 1:11:32.287
[panting]
I mean,

1:11:32.289 --> 1:11:34.489
how can anybody,
in their right mind,

1:11:34.491 --> 1:11:35.823
think that the fucking
extraterrestrials

1:11:35.825 --> 1:11:37.325
even wanna fucking come back?

1:11:37.326 --> 1:11:38.826
Do they really think
they're that fucking stupid?

1:11:39.562 --> 1:11:40.928
Huh?

1:11:40.930 --> 1:11:43.131
[panting]

1:11:43.132 --> 1:11:45.333
And what the fuck would they
be interested in discovering

1:11:45.335 --> 1:11:48.436
out here in our little piece
of shit corner of the galaxy,

1:11:48.438 --> 1:11:50.338
populated by nothing, but a...

1:11:50.940 --> 1:11:51.973
worthless,

1:11:52.942 --> 1:11:54.108
miserable,

1:11:54.110 --> 1:11:55.376
selfish,

1:11:55.378 --> 1:11:57.578

-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay.

Yeah. Oh, god.

1:12:38.722 --> 1:12:41.055
Yeah. You must have been out
to fucking lunch

1:12:41.057 --> 1:12:43.891
the day you left your fucking
underlings in charge,

1:12:43.893 --> 1:12:45.693
to come up with us.

1:12:45.695 --> 1:12:47.595
To create us fucking
human beings.

1:12:47.597 --> 1:12:49.397
And they used all
the fucking shit

1:12:49.399 --> 1:12:50.965
that they could find
around up there.

1:12:50.967 --> 1:12:52.533
And it's fucking in us.

1:12:52.535 --> 1:12:54.135

1:13:00.977 --> 1:13:03.544
Oh, they are the fucking worst.

1:13:03.546 --> 1:13:04.846
The fucking worst.

[breathing heavily]

1:13:06.850 --> 1:13:08.716
[panting]
Okay.

1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:12.186
All of it, it's just...

1:13:12.188 --> 1:13:13.821
a matter of time now.

1:13:13.823 --> 1:13:15.523

We're the good ones, okay?

All right?

1:13:38.081 --> 1:13:40.047
[breathes heavily]
It's gonna be okay.

1:13:41.151 --> 1:13:42.617
We're gonna get you home.

-Christ!

No trace of Sam, sir.

1:14:15.118 --> 1:14:17.652
Then he's probably taking her
back to his lair.

1:14:19.055 --> 1:14:20.188
[Sara] Help!

1:14:21.458 --> 1:14:22.623

-[wailing]
-Hey.

1:14:41.511 --> 1:14:43.244
[inspector] All right.
What's eating you, little lady?

1:14:43.246 --> 1:14:44.712
Those fucking bears?

1:14:44.714 --> 1:14:45.913
No. Please.

-[wailing]
-Put her in the car.

1:14:54.724 --> 1:14:56.624
And you give her something
to calm her down.

1:14:56.626 --> 1:14:58.259
-Now.
-[crying]

1:15:03.766 --> 1:15:05.766
What the hell is going on here?

1:15:05.768 --> 1:15:08.169
You still not finished
with that documentary, or what?

1:15:08.171 --> 1:15:10.271
Yeah.
[chuckles]

1:15:10.273 --> 1:15:12.740
Uh, no. I'm working on a sequel,
so, um...

1:15:12.742 --> 1:15:14.942
[stammers]
I guess, no. Um...

1:15:14.944 --> 1:15:17.879
But, I, I don't know
what happened, Inspector.

1:15:17.881 --> 1:15:19.614
I... I saw her over
on the other side,

1:15:19.616 --> 1:15:21.849
and, you know, she was running
away from the barracks.

1:15:21.851 --> 1:15:23.751
So what the hell happened
to her?

1:15:23.753 --> 1:15:26.554
I don't know. I think
she's a little crazy, Inspector.

1:15:26.556 --> 1:15:28.055
[stammers]
She was going on and on

1:15:28.057 --> 1:15:29.557
about... about an abduction

1:15:29.559 --> 1:15:31.559
and a woman
in a white nurse's uniform.

1:15:31.561 --> 1:15:33.094
[stutters]
She's too Cuckoo.

1:15:33.096 --> 1:15:34.662
Did you not see Joe up there?

1:15:36.599 --> 1:15:39.033
Speaking of the devil,
there he is!

1:15:39.035 --> 1:15:40.935
[inspector] Can you wait for me
in the car, asswipe?

1:15:43.239 --> 1:15:44.589
Yeah, well, I can't wait to hear

1:15:44.590 --> 1:15:45.940
what kinda cockamamie
bullshit stories--

1:15:45.942 --> 1:15:47.542
-Get the fuck out of here!
-[grunts]

1:15:56.719 --> 1:15:58.653
-I'm really sorry.
-You're sorry?

1:16:00.924 --> 1:16:02.757
What the fuck
happened here, Joe?

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:05.560
I mean, can somebody,
please, tell me

1:16:05.562 --> 1:16:06.994
what the hell is going on?

1:16:08.131 --> 1:16:10.164
I've got an agent
mauled to death.

1:16:11.067 --> 1:16:12.900
Oh, and then some girl turns up,

1:16:12.902 --> 1:16:15.369
making absolutely no sense,
whatsoever.

1:16:15.371 --> 1:16:18.573
And going on
about some abduction.

1:16:18.575 --> 1:16:20.741
It didn't occur to you
to call me?

1:16:20.743 --> 1:16:23.377
Am I the only sane one
on this fucking planet, or what?

1:16:23.379 --> 1:16:25.112
-Look, I'm sorry.
-Yeah. You already said that.

1:16:26.182 --> 1:16:27.982
[Joe] The guy's just got
a little too...

1:16:29.218 --> 1:16:30.318
Oh, Jesus.

1:16:33.957 --> 1:16:36.123
Well, it looks like you got
your work cut out for you.

1:16:36.125 --> 1:16:37.358
You'd better get on with it.

1:16:38.628 --> 1:16:40.027
Yeah. I best had.

1:16:42.632 --> 1:16:43.931
You'll have to excuse me.

1:16:49.205 --> 1:16:51.238
[Joe] Come find me
whenever you want.

1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:53.608
<i> Mi casa su casa and all that.</i>
