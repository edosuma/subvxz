Hi!

01:30.156 --> 01:34.427
I’ve got everything
we’ll need for Thanksgiving...

01:36.797 --> 01:38.732
...dinner.

01:38.765 --> 01:42.168
I’ve got everything we need
for Thanksgiving dinner.

01:42.202 --> 01:45.338
Thanksgiving dinner
is as good as cooked.

01:45.371 --> 01:48.842
Pass the word,
I’ve got the bird.

01:51.678 --> 01:54.280
Oh, I guess it is true,
what they say

01:54.314 --> 01:56.482
Birds with no feathers
do flock together.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.421
May I ask why?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.624
Well, I assumed that I would
cook dinner this year.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.458
It’s my first Thanksgiving
as Larry’s wife.

02:05.491 --> 02:07.694
And I want it to be special.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.795
I’ve made Thanksgiving dinner
every single year

02:09.830 --> 02:13.433
since I come to America, so,
so I just assumed that, that

02:13.466 --> 02:15.702
I would,
I would make it again.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.337
Well, that, that’s okay.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.940
How about, how about
I’ll take Thanksgiving

02:19.973 --> 02:22.408
and you take Christmas
and Mud Day?

02:25.245 --> 02:28.381
Balki, we don’t celebrate
Mud Day in this country.

02:28.414 --> 02:31.217
Well, it’s just as well.
You’d only commercialize it.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.321
Wait a minute, I wanted to cook
Thanksgiving dinner

02:35.355 --> 02:37.290
so I could prove
to a certain someone

02:37.323 --> 02:40.260
what a wonderful wife
I would make.

02:40.293 --> 02:43.229
Oh, Mary Anne,
that is great.

02:43.263 --> 02:44.898
You invited someone?

02:50.436 --> 02:52.539
You are not gonna believe
what I just did.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.241
You forgot we moved and you went
back to the old apartment again?

02:57.578 --> 02:59.412
Yeah, I did.

02:59.445 --> 03:02.415
But before that, I was out
at McGregor’s Farm

03:02.448 --> 03:03.917
and, and I was writing
a turkey story‐‐

03:03.950 --> 03:06.853
Now, cousin, cousin, cousin,
you are too hard on yourself.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.856
Now, Mr. Wainwright occasionally
calls your writing mediocre

03:09.890 --> 03:11.391
but he has never come out

03:11.424 --> 03:13.627
and called one of your
articles a turkey.

03:13.660 --> 03:16.496
Well, except for that one time
but you weren’t even in the room

03:16.530 --> 03:18.532
so, as far as I’m concerned,
it never happened.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.938
I mean, I was writing
a story about turkeys

03:24.971 --> 03:27.007
for tomorrow’s
Thanksgiving edition.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.942
Well, in that case,
never mind.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.880
Well, anyway, while I was
interviewing Mr. McGregor

03:33.914 --> 03:35.616
he told me he was retiring

03:35.649 --> 03:38.451
and I could take as many turkeys
as I wanted for half price.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.987
So, having a keen eye for a
quick profit, I took ’em all.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.658
How many is all?

03:44.691 --> 03:46.693
Fifty‐eight.

‐Probably ground pepper.

turkeys are the practical jokers
of the farmyard.

how gullible the cows are

had to swallow it.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.807
you later found out
that the job you did well

09:33.840 --> 09:36.309
was the wrong thing to do
even though you thought

09:36.342 --> 09:39.980
it was the right thing
to do at the time

09:40.013 --> 09:42.315
that you were doing
that good job.

wasn’t thinking.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.383

turkey back from the Johnsons.

is cooked.

switch cooked turkeys.

Well, cousin, that’s not all
we’re gonna have to do.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.770

deal with

that are headed this way.

let me do all the talking.

better off telling the truth.

to say to her?

12:13.499 --> 12:16.236
Excuse me, Mrs. Johnson
but your turkey swallowed

12:16.269 --> 12:19.272
a very expensive diamond and I
would just like the opportunity

12:19.305 --> 12:21.808
to rummage through the bird
in the hopes of retrieving it?

12:23.109 --> 12:24.410
I’d believe it.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.046
Well, I have something
else in mind.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.114
Something a little
more believable.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.384
I am going to tell her
that you made a tiny error

12:31.417 --> 12:33.219
and sold them
a poisoned turkey

12:33.253 --> 12:37.090
that could kill
their entire family.

12:37.123 --> 12:40.026
Then we’ll exchange our bird for
their bird and be on our way.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.929
It’s a whole lot simpler than
telling them the truth.

12:42.963 --> 12:46.199
Alright, ready?
Here we go.

12:46.232 --> 12:50.203
Cousin, you know, I, I think
it’s, I think it’s too late

12:50.236 --> 12:54.274
to, to do your plan,
they’re already having dinner.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.977
Well, if they’re already eating
the poison thing won’t work.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.078
Alright, I’ll have to think
of something else.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.379
Ju‐just don’t let them
see you.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.348
Hello, Mrs. Johnson!

13:02.382 --> 13:03.884
Mrs. Johnson is coming
to the door.

13:03.917 --> 13:07.420
Well, get out of the window.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.857
Mrs. Johnson likes me.

13:10.891 --> 13:11.992
Hello, Balki.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.127
‐Hello, Mrs. Johnson.
‐Oh!

13:14.160 --> 13:16.830
‐Happy Thanksgiving!
‐Yes.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.532
What can I do for you?

13:18.565 --> 13:22.068
Uh, yeah, Mrs. Johnson,
we’re here, uh, because

13:22.102 --> 13:25.872
uh, because we are a full
service turkey organization.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.274
And, and, and, and, uh,
so, we’re, we’re

13:28.308 --> 13:30.143
we’re here to
serve your bird.

13:31.945 --> 13:35.181
We sell ’em, we slice ’em,
we serve ’em.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.250
That’s, that’s very sweet.

13:37.283 --> 13:39.219
Uh, but we already have
everything on the table.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.287
Whoa, ho, ho, ho.
What about seconds?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.923
What about side dishes?
What about beverages?

13:42.956 --> 13:43.990
What about desserts?

13:44.024 --> 13:46.459
What about driver’s side
air bags?

13:46.492 --> 13:48.194
Just stop it.
Let me do the talking.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.297
Let me do the talking.
Thank you very much.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.334
Mrs. Johnson, we’re here
to make sure that this is

13:54.367 --> 13:57.237
the best darn Thanksgiving
the Johnsons ever had.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.472
Come on, Balki.
We’ve got a meal to serve.

14:04.578 --> 14:08.048
Believe me, nobody can dish it
out like Cousin Larry.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.019
Hello! Hello!

14:13.053 --> 14:14.621
Don’t stand up.
Don’t stand up.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.292
Have you done something
different in here?

14:19.325 --> 14:22.563
I wouldn’t know,
I’ve never been in here.

14:22.596 --> 14:25.966
Marion, what’s the foreign boy
from down the street doing here?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.401
Well, I’m not
really sure.

14:28.434 --> 14:32.172
Um, Larry and Balki,
this is my husband, Howard.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.075
‐Hi!
‐And this is our son, Richie.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.244
Our daughter, Joanie
and Grandpa Johnson.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.180
Well, it’s a pleasure
meeting you all.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.915
Why don’t you just sit down
and, uh

14:41.948 --> 14:43.617
enjoy your
Thanksgiving dinner?

14:43.650 --> 14:46.587
We’re here just to make your
meal a little more enjoyable.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.955
Why?

14:48.989 --> 14:52.659
Well, Howard, Thanksgiving has
always been a, a special time

14:52.693 --> 14:55.195
at the Appleton home
and, uh, I just thought

14:55.228 --> 14:57.063
I’d like to share
that special feeling this year

14:57.097 --> 14:58.464
with a few close friends.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.433
What’s the Appleton home?

15:02.302 --> 15:05.539
Well...it’s my home.
And I’m Larry Appleton.

15:05.572 --> 15:09.242
And I’m Balki Bartokomous.

15:09.275 --> 15:13.079
Oh, Mrs., um, Mrs. Johnson,
your stuffing looks delicious.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.281
Do you use chestnuts
or walnuts?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.217
Me, I use a handful
of beer nuts.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.320
Uh, Balki!

15:20.353 --> 15:21.655
Why, why don’t
we all just, uh

15:21.688 --> 15:23.356
bow our heads for grace?

15:23.389 --> 15:24.490
Howard, would you do
the honors?

15:24.525 --> 15:26.326
I’ve, I’ve already said grace.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.462
Oh, ha, yeah.
And I missed it.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.331
And you know, it just doesn’t
feel like Thanksgiving

15:31.364 --> 15:33.099
with‐without, uh,
hearing grace.

15:33.133 --> 15:36.537
Uh, Howard, just say grace and,
and maybe they’ll go away.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.174
Let us bow our heads.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.644
Dear Lord, we thank you for
the food we are about to eat.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.212
For the good fortune our
family’s been blessed with.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.982
‐’We come together...’
‐Alright, now...

15:49.015 --> 15:50.617
If the turkey
swallowed the...

15:50.651 --> 15:53.019
(Mr. Howard)
’...things easily
taken for granted’

15:53.053 --> 15:54.220
’which we also
give thanks to...’

15:58.424 --> 16:00.260
Alright, now listen, if the
turkey swallowed the ring

16:00.293 --> 16:01.728
it would be in the gizzard.

16:01.762 --> 16:04.097
Now the gizzard is either
in the stuffing or in the gravy.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.367
You check the stuffing and the
gravy. I’ll check the turkey.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.402
...today and always, amen!

16:09.435 --> 16:10.370
(all)
Amen!

16:10.403 --> 16:14.207
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:14.240 --> 16:16.276
I think we all have
a little more

16:16.309 --> 16:18.211
to be grateful for
than that.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.647
Huh?

16:20.681 --> 16:23.249
Y‐you know, I, I would like
to say a few words

16:23.283 --> 16:25.552
so if we could just
bow our heads again.

16:25.586 --> 16:28.589
‐I’m hungry.
‐Me, too.

16:28.622 --> 16:30.624
And so are children
all over the world

16:30.657 --> 16:32.092
but they have no food to eat.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.599
Which is why we have
so much to be thankful for.

16:38.632 --> 16:41.535
So could we just bow our heads

16:41.568 --> 16:45.271
and reflect on the true
meaning of this day?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.108
Thanksgiving.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.483
The stuffing.
Check the stuffing.

16:57.518 --> 16:59.152
The stuffing.
Shut up!

16:59.185 --> 17:01.121
Thanksgiving!

17:01.154 --> 17:04.790
Thanks and giving.

17:04.825 --> 17:07.627
What do these
two words mean?

17:07.661 --> 17:09.362
I know! I know!

17:09.395 --> 17:12.432
Heads down! Heads down!
Nobody said anything.

17:12.464 --> 17:13.767
Cousin, I know,
I know what they...

17:13.800 --> 17:15.502
Shut up! Shut up!

17:16.737 --> 17:18.070
Giving, giving...

17:18.104 --> 17:19.573
The gravy, the gravy.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.342
Giving, the‐the act of

17:22.375 --> 17:25.178
imparting or bestowing.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.547
That’s what I was gonna say.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.848
Shut up!

17:27.881 --> 17:30.651
Now, putting these
two words

17:30.684 --> 17:32.152
back together...

17:35.656 --> 17:40.260
...we have, we have
Thanksgiving.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.463
The, the bestowal
of gratitude.

17:43.496 --> 17:47.433
Balki! Help me! Help me!

17:47.467 --> 17:51.271
And‐and looking around
I see that we

17:51.304 --> 17:53.707
we have so much
to be grateful for.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.277
Eyes down, missy.

17:58.879 --> 18:01.114
Just the,
just the facts of...

18:01.147 --> 18:02.816
[mumbling]

18:02.849 --> 18:05.752
Just the fact of,
of being together

18:05.786 --> 18:07.888
is, is something
to be grateful for.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.523
Have you finished yet?
I...

18:09.556 --> 18:10.857
Oh! Oh, Howard!

18:10.891 --> 18:12.793
Am I taking too long

18:12.826 --> 18:17.230
to express gratitude
to our Creator?

18:17.263 --> 18:18.464
Hmm?

18:18.498 --> 18:19.766
I mean, you know,
I could just say that

18:19.800 --> 18:22.703
Howard didn’t want to
take the time

18:22.736 --> 18:25.338
to thank the man upstairs.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.610
Heads down!
Heads down!

18:29.643 --> 18:30.744
Thanksgiving...

18:30.777 --> 18:32.546
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

18:32.579 --> 18:35.516
Thanksgiving, being grateful,
grateful

18:35.549 --> 18:38.184
for the air we breathe

18:38.218 --> 18:40.887
for the few merciless...

18:40.921 --> 18:42.556
I’m throwing them out.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.825
Maybe we should do
what they say.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.327
I, I think they’re crazy.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.295
[indistinct shouting]

18:50.631 --> 18:53.634
Thankful to those for giving...

18:56.236 --> 18:57.804
Cousin!
Cousin, go deep.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.746
Grandpa’s choking on
the ring.

19:05.779 --> 19:07.347
Grandpa! Grandpa!

19:07.380 --> 19:09.750
Let’s get those arms up!
Arms up! Arms up!

19:09.783 --> 19:12.252
[squealing]

19:12.285 --> 19:13.486
Come on.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.857
Come on, you old geezer.
Cough up the ring.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.358
[groaning]

19:21.361 --> 19:24.397
I’m not choking!
I’m not choking!

19:24.430 --> 19:27.934
Leave my father alone
and get the hell out of here!

19:27.968 --> 19:29.703
[indistinct shouting]

19:33.774 --> 19:35.509
[instrumental music]

19:37.611 --> 19:39.946
You’re welcome.
And Happy Thanksgiving.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.750
Larry, it was very nice of you

19:43.784 --> 19:46.452
to donate those turkeys
to the homeless shelter.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.855
Well, I like to do
what I can

19:48.889 --> 19:51.625
for the less fortunate
during the holiday season.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.260
Cousin Larry’s exact words were

19:54.294 --> 19:56.897
"As long as I’m stuck
with all these turkeys

19:56.930 --> 19:59.733
I may as well at least
get a tax deduction out of it."

20:03.303 --> 20:04.905
I, I think it would be
nice if we all just

20:04.938 --> 20:07.307
uh, took a moment and, uh

20:07.340 --> 20:10.611
gave thanks
for all that we have.

20:10.644 --> 20:14.480
Oh, well, um, I’m thankful for
two of the best friends

20:14.515 --> 20:16.950
anyone could ever hope for.

20:16.983 --> 20:20.787
And I’m thankful to the most
understanding husband

20:20.821 --> 20:23.557
in the world who didn’t get
angry with me

20:23.590 --> 20:27.260
when I found my diamond ring
in my jewelry box.

20:31.532 --> 20:33.534
I’m thankful that we have
the opportunity

20:33.567 --> 20:37.337
to share
Thanksgiving together.

20:37.370 --> 20:41.942
Well, uh, I don’t know
where to begin.

20:41.975 --> 20:46.412
Uh...this has been the most
wonderful year of my life.

20:46.446 --> 20:49.650
And I have a lot
to be grateful for.

20:49.683 --> 20:53.386
I’m married to the most
wonderful woman in the world

20:53.419 --> 20:56.690
and I’m thankful
for our lovely home.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.792
And the two dear friends
who share it with us.

21:00.994 --> 21:04.565
I’m very thankful that I’m out
of the turkey selling business.

21:07.668 --> 21:10.671
Although I know with a,
a little time

21:10.704 --> 21:14.841
and a lot more support

21:14.875 --> 21:16.276
I could’ve made a go of it.

21:30.090 --> 21:32.859
I have a lot to be
thankful for.

21:32.893 --> 21:36.329
I’m celebrating my first
truly American holiday

21:36.362 --> 21:38.899
as an American citizen,
and, um...

21:40.466 --> 21:44.037
I want to thank Mary Anne

21:44.070 --> 21:46.740
Cousin Jennifer

21:46.773 --> 21:48.742
and Cousin Larry

21:48.775 --> 21:51.444
for all of their
love and support.

21:52.813 --> 21:56.482
And uh...
I want to thank the Johnsons

21:56.517 --> 21:57.984
for not calling the police

22:00.153 --> 22:04.658
even though Grandpa Johnson
wanted to press charges.

22:08.428 --> 22:11.464
Let’s eat.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.635
Now, who had
the Salisbury steak.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.537
I did.

22:16.570 --> 22:19.606
And the cheese enchilada?
Yeah, over there.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.508
I’ve got the lasagna.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.910
Cousin, a hungry man for you.

22:31.752 --> 22:34.688
[theme music]

22:51.772 --> 22:54.708
[music continues]
