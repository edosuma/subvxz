<i>You think you know everything</i>

00:32.400 --> 00:34.233
there is to know about heroes?

00:34.235 --> 00:36.068
<i>Yesterday I woke up</i>
<i>and I thought</i>

00:36.070 --> 00:38.504
<i>i knew everything there</i>
<i>was to know about my life.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:40.205
<i>But I was wrong,</i>

00:40.207 --> 00:42.174
<i>and I wasn't just</i>
<i>wrong about my life,</i>

00:42.176 --> 00:44.243
<i>i was wrong about my friends,</i>

00:44.245 --> 00:46.145
<i>about my family,</i>

00:46.147 --> 00:48.280
<i>about where I come from.</i>

00:48.282 --> 00:50.649
<i>Way, way wrong.</i>

00:56.589 --> 00:59.358
<i>Help! Help!</i>

01:27.321 --> 01:30.389
Ah! Ah!

01:39.866 --> 01:41.200
Don't kill me.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.568
Please don't kill me.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.103
Shut up.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.471
I already told you,

01:45.473 --> 01:47.239
I don't know anything
about postman project.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.340
Stand.

01:49.342 --> 01:50.476
Shut up,

01:51.711 --> 01:53.345
and hold still.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.814
What are you going to do?
What, what?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.116
Aren't you going to kill me?

01:57.118 --> 01:58.317
Well, not right now.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.124
Nope.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.862
Aargh.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.376
Sir,

02:24.378 --> 02:28.280
I got a negative reading
and a viable candidate.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.349
<i>Very good, mister Finch.</i>

02:31.384 --> 02:32.651
<i>You know what to do.</i>

02:32.653 --> 02:34.586
Copy that.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.556
<i>Report back when</i>
<i>you're finished.</i>

02:37.558 --> 02:40.926
<i>I've had an idea that</i>
<i>will take us a little</i>

02:42.162 --> 02:44.429
<i>closer to home.</i>

02:44.431 --> 02:45.631
Sir.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.500
I know about you.

02:49.536 --> 02:50.736
I know who you work for.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.606
What he wants is impossible!

02:57.610 --> 02:59.478
You said you weren't
going to kill me.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.180
Well,

03:01.182 --> 03:02.347
I said, "not right now."

03:03.583 --> 03:04.850
It's not right now anymore.

03:24.604 --> 03:27.339
Denny,

03:27.341 --> 03:28.840
you've been hitting
snooze for half an hour,

03:28.842 --> 03:30.475
so, I know you can hear me.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.344
Mom's working so you're my ride.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.549
If I'm late again,
I get detention.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.319

And that's the final bell,

05:58.959 --> 06:01.593
Dude, you know my legs makes
me slower than I used to be.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.862
No, I'll just tell Mrs. Nelson,
you completely suck.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.498
Dude!

06:08.968 --> 06:11.370
Whoa, slow down, Archie.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.138
You don't wanna fall down
and bust open that brain.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.606
I can't, I'm late again.

06:21.647 --> 06:22.948
Good morning, den.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.116
Good morning, Gwen.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.919
You know, If boy Brainiac
gets any more tardies

06:27.921 --> 06:30.489
you're going to ruin his chances
of being valedictorian.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.657
Yeah! Brother of the year,
right here.

06:36.696 --> 06:37.896
Hey, no, I got it.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.664
Yeah, but I got it easier.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.766
How's the leg?

06:43.469 --> 06:47.672
Physical therapy hurt yesterday,

06:47.674 --> 06:52.077
but If I want to walk across
that stage without crutches...

06:52.079 --> 06:54.079
At least someone
is getting a diploma.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.614
Well you know,

06:55.616 --> 06:56.815
summer school is not the
end of the world, Gwen.

06:56.817 --> 06:57.949
You just tough it
out till August,

06:57.951 --> 06:59.484
You'll be with us by spring.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.753
Yeah, so I can room with
the un-popular girl,

07:01.755 --> 07:03.822
with that wicked bieber
fever over the fall

07:03.824 --> 07:06.491
and sings you
"smile" in her sleep?

07:06.493 --> 07:07.592
Never say never.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.529
No thanks,

07:10.531 --> 07:13.165
besides, academia
isn't for me anyways.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.467
It doesn't have enough grease.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.135
Are you still thinking of
working at the shop full time?

07:17.137 --> 07:19.671
Stringer wants me to.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.173
People will always
have cars, Denny,

07:21.175 --> 07:22.841
and They'll always need fixing.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.977
The people or the cars?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.913
If they end up like you,
it'll be both.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.918
Oh, just one more
day of this place,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.886
and then the world is ours.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.488
Us in charge of the world.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.089
What could possibly
go wrong with that?

07:38.091 --> 07:41.193
Mutually assured destruction.

07:41.195 --> 07:43.995
Can anyone tell me what that is?

07:43.997 --> 07:46.164
You seniors,
I know It's your last day,

07:46.166 --> 07:47.933
but the rest of you
need to pay attention.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.669
This is gonna be on the final.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.103
Well, maybe you guys are
too young to remember

07:52.105 --> 07:53.738
life before cell phones,

07:53.740 --> 07:54.940
or Facebook.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.910
So remember what it was like.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.714
What?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.916
Remember what was what like,
Mrs. Perry?

08:04.918 --> 08:06.618
Very good, mister hall.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.720
I'm glad someone's awake today.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.622
Goodness.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.723
Mister Burke.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.757
Happy you could join us.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.025
Ah, come on,
Mrs. Perry,

08:14.027 --> 08:15.560
I was trying to
sneak in unnoticed.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.762
And you failed spectacularly.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.631
Please take your seat, Denny.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.932
I'm gonna mark you as tardy.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.073
Hey, I think Lisa's
still mad at you.

08:31.544 --> 08:33.010
Yeah, I got that, thanks.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.014
Okay, mister hall.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.215
When you play basketball...

08:37.217 --> 08:39.116
state championship basketball.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.585
Pellian city high school.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.121
Yes, yes, yes, we're well aware

08:43.123 --> 08:45.056
of your accomplishments
on the court.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.926
But, how do you know
who wins the game?

08:47.928 --> 08:50.896
Uh, the team with the most
points at the end wins?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.030
Okay.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.865
And how do you score points?

08:55.701 --> 08:58.203
Uh, I don't know, but...

08:58.205 --> 08:59.538
You put the ball
through the hoop

08:59.540 --> 09:01.106
until the game is over, right?

09:01.108 --> 09:04.276
Now, what If,
every time you scored a point,

09:04.278 --> 09:06.611
you wiped out the other team?

09:09.782 --> 09:11.283
Yes.

09:11.285 --> 09:14.553
Well, you have to keep
the other team from scoring.

09:14.555 --> 09:17.122
But, by winning you'd
be killing everybody.

09:17.124 --> 09:20.158
So you'd need your own
ball for protection.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.160
So then who wins the game,
miss Thompson?

09:22.162 --> 09:23.695
Nobody does.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.597
It would be at a standstill.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.831
Stalemate.

09:26.833 --> 09:30.635
You see,
no one wins If everyone dies.

09:32.672 --> 09:35.340
Warfare's about
tactical advantages.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.677
Someone gets one,

09:38.679 --> 09:40.779
one.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.248
They're just trying to
score the final point,

09:44.951 --> 09:46.284
before the buzzer.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.787
Heavy stuff in peds today.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.021
What a great note to end on.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.723
Really man,
don't worry about it.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.792
We've been cool with the
Russians since like the '70s.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.695
The cold war ended
in '89, meathead.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.597
No wonder you're
failing poli sci.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.965
Okay, I'm a '90s kid,
all right, Gwendolyn?

09:59.967 --> 10:01.766
We're '90s kids,

10:01.768 --> 10:03.234
why do we have to worry about
who used to have missiles?

10:03.236 --> 10:05.036
And I'm pulling a solid c
in that class.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.705
It's the missiles that
aren't the scary part,

10:06.707 --> 10:08.373
It's the concept, Adam.
Oh, yeah.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.841
I kinda like it.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.743
Someone burns you,
you burn 'em back.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.745
Yeah, but then you're
both left with scars.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.914
Guys, guys, guys.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.616
We graduate soon.
All right?

10:17.618 --> 10:19.050
And tomorrow,

10:19.052 --> 10:21.353
Denny's climbing his first
Mountain in over a year.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.188
Yeah, If we can even
get into the place.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.824
Tanner said some guy bought all
that land and closed it off.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.659
Yeah. Well, life's
about workarounds.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.028
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

10:30.030 --> 10:31.730
We could just go to
the practice wall.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.866
Practice? Denny, you're
an award winning climber.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.769
I was... with 100 documented
hours on the ropes.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.004
You've climbed some
of the most dangerous

10:39.006 --> 10:40.372
mountains in the country.

10:40.374 --> 10:41.773
And If it wasn't for
your little accident,

10:41.775 --> 10:43.308
which wasn't your fault,
I might add,

10:43.310 --> 10:45.343
you would have gone
on mount doom already.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.646
Look, the point is,
we're about to graduate...

10:47.648 --> 10:49.214
some of us do.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.082
Some of us, right.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.218
Ah, well, we've got to get
all of the stupid stuff

10:53.220 --> 10:54.953
out of our systems
before we split up

10:54.955 --> 10:56.388
and go to different colleges.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.356
Ya'll know college kids
don't do stupid stuff.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.126
They're responsible adults.

11:01.128 --> 11:04.029
If worse comes to worse,
We'll all be together.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.765
Looking up at that
ridiculously high Mountain,

11:06.767 --> 11:08.967
and you guys, please tell me,

11:08.969 --> 11:11.202
why is the Mountain there?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.804
So it can be conquered.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.939
Boom. Thank you.
Exactly.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.708
Denny, just one last
Mountain before you

11:16.710 --> 11:17.776
walk across that stage

11:17.778 --> 11:19.010
and into the rest of your life.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.712
I'm begging you, please.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.181
Okay.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.451
Hey, detention should
be over by now.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.752
Where's Archie?

11:38.330 --> 11:41.933
<i>♪ I don't care what</i>
<i>you're laughing about ♪</i>

11:41.935 --> 11:44.269
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,

11:44.271 --> 11:46.738
let me introduce our
special guest today,

11:46.740 --> 11:48.239
mister Archibald Burke.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.241
He's here promoting
his new movie,

11:50.243 --> 11:53.244
I'm a total effing
loser with no friends,

11:53.246 --> 11:56.848
except for books
and Internet videos.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.884
What can you tell us
about the movie, Archie?

11:59.886 --> 12:00.985
Leave me alone.

12:01.954 --> 12:03.988
Oh, "leave me alone."

12:03.990 --> 12:08.159
Hmm, I'm not sure that's gonna
get past our p.R. People.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.162
Hmm, okay, so let's try
a different quote.

12:11.164 --> 12:15.033
Uh, how about,
"hey, that's mine"?

12:15.035 --> 12:16.201
Hey, that's mine.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.372
Good, you can take notes.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.008
Now take this one.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.144
If you kill the finals
curve in tiggins' class

12:26.146 --> 12:28.880
next week I'm gonna
come looking for you.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.815
I need to pass that class.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.251
If I tank it I'll
wreck my g.P.A.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.519
Wreck his gpa.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.322
If you don't...

12:39.959 --> 12:42.794
I'm gonna wreck your life.

12:42.796 --> 12:43.862
Got it?

12:43.864 --> 12:44.996
Got it.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.085
Hey, there he is.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.154
Where you are little
man, we were...

13:09.156 --> 13:10.855
dude, Archie, what happened?

13:10.857 --> 13:11.923
Nothing.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.424
No, tell me what happened.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.193
Nothing happened, okay!

13:15.195 --> 13:17.061
I just fell down the
stairs or whatever.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.296
Don't lie to me.
Who did this to you?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.564
Was it ferguson
and his friends?

13:19.566 --> 13:22.534
I swear...
it wasn't anybody, okay?

13:22.536 --> 13:25.570
Hell, you can't be able to do
anything about it anyway, Denny.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.972
God, just take me home.

13:35.314 --> 13:39.884
<i>♪ I'm drifting</i>
<i>out of the space ♪</i>

13:39.886 --> 13:44.055

13:44.057 --> 13:48.593

13:48.595 --> 13:53.031

13:53.033 --> 13:57.235

14:12.218 --> 14:13.952
Archie.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.019
Archie.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.621
Archie.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.622
I don't want to talk about it.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.958
I do want to talk about it.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.328
Look, I know things aren't
exactly fantastic right now.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.996
I know that I've messed up,

14:24.998 --> 14:26.878
and I've been bringing
you late to school. Okay?

14:27.933 --> 14:30.001
I'm sorry. I'm trying.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.170
Trying? Great!
That makes two of us.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.338
I'm trying to help
you understand

14:33.340 --> 14:34.639
that I'm getting
killed out there.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.608
Can't you see that?

14:36.610 --> 14:39.010
People at that school
hate me, Denny.

14:39.012 --> 14:43.181
They don't hate you, Archie.
Yeah, they do. A lot.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.616
Those kids.

14:44.618 --> 14:48.353
They hate me because
I'm smarter than them.

14:48.355 --> 14:51.256
People are always gonna be
afraid of intelligence, Archie.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.991
Yeah? Well I guess
it will always

14:52.993 --> 14:54.325
suck to be me then, huh?

14:54.327 --> 14:55.560
Get out...

14:55.562 --> 14:56.995
dude, you've got to
listen to me.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.296
No, I don't!

14:58.298 --> 15:00.965
I don't have to do
anything you say, Denny.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.467
You're not dad.

15:05.437 --> 15:08.439
Dad left. Remember?

15:09.541 --> 15:11.976
That looks familiar.

15:11.978 --> 15:15.980
I used to fight like that
with my brother Kevin.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.350
Your father, Kevin,
I should say.

15:21.553 --> 15:23.521
Hello, boys.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.593
I should introduce myself.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.229
It's been a while since
we've seen each other.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.397
I'm your Uncle William.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.400
Uncle Billy?

15:35.402 --> 15:36.534
That's me.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.476
Now, will you please...

15:48.247 --> 15:49.347
Invite me in?

16:03.329 --> 16:07.732
So, uh, not to be rude
or forward or anything,

16:07.734 --> 16:10.201
but why exactly are you...

16:10.203 --> 16:11.336
am I here?

16:13.238 --> 16:15.239
To celebrate you, of course.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.108
Excuse me?

16:17.110 --> 16:19.711
I received your graduation
invitation in the mail.

16:21.547 --> 16:24.716
And I realized
it had been far too long

16:24.718 --> 16:28.186
since I'd seen this family.
And I've been out of touch.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.090
You know,
I am a man of science.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.692
Well, I didn't know that.

16:34.694 --> 16:38.663
Your father never told
you about my work.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.566
Mom said you were an overseas
entrepreneur or something.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.669
A group of very powerful men
overseas hired me

16:44.671 --> 16:47.005
for my knowledge on a
subject I know very well.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.307
Genetics.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.377
I led a team of scientists

16:52.379 --> 16:56.781
and we discovered some
very interesting things.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.416
Ah. Like what?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.318
Hello, Archie. Feeling better.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.662
Did your father ever
tell you how we used to

17:11.664 --> 17:14.598
fight the other boys
in the streets?

17:14.601 --> 17:15.733
<i>No.</i>

17:16.734 --> 17:18.069
We did.

17:53.372 --> 17:56.707
Kevin! William!
Get your butts in gear!

17:56.709 --> 17:58.309
I'm not taking you out
once It's dark!

17:59.578 --> 18:00.745
Boys!

18:02.781 --> 18:04.315
What is going on up here?

18:06.618 --> 18:09.554
<i>Get up, little girl.</i>
<i>My friends are...</i>

18:09.556 --> 18:11.489
what did I tell you
about locking this door?

18:11.491 --> 18:13.157
Go, go. Go, go.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.393
Boys!

18:20.332 --> 18:21.432
Open this door!

18:25.604 --> 18:28.739
Kevin Archibald Burke!
You get back here right now!

18:30.609 --> 18:33.845
That's it!
I am confiscating all the candy!

18:33.847 --> 18:37.548
I really don't want
dad to be mad at us.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.251
If he gets mad at any one,
he'll just get mad at me.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.752
Then when he gets mad at you...

18:41.754 --> 18:46.457
Billy, Billy,
leave the old man to me.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.659
I'll take care of it.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.794
You know I always do.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.297
Okay?
Okay.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.832
Kevin and I were...

18:59.771 --> 19:01.739
Lots of good memories here.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.674
You said you
discovered something?

19:03.676 --> 19:05.843
I don't want to lose you
on the science, young man.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.278
Well, I mean,
Archie can handle it.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.313
His IQ is 125.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.448
Ah 129.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.452
Some other time perhaps.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.654
So I was saying Dennis, I...

19:16.656 --> 19:19.657
It's Denny. It's Denny now.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.827
I haven't been Dennis
since the 4th grade.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.463
All right then, Denny.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.233
I'm here because
I was going to give you

19:29.235 --> 19:30.535
your graduation gift,

19:30.537 --> 19:33.271
but, however, I'm not sure

19:33.273 --> 19:36.274
It's appropriate now given...

19:40.279 --> 19:42.413
No, I-I understand.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.515
It's a shame.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.450
Arrangements have
already been made.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.254
I used my overseas earnings

19:50.256 --> 19:54.692
to purchase a large property
just outside of the barrows.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.227
There's a Mountain out there

19:56.229 --> 19:57.929
that I hear is quite
the thrill to climb.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.365
You bought mount Dominic?

20:01.367 --> 20:02.833
Few times I talked
to your father

20:02.835 --> 20:05.336
he was very proud of your
climbing achievements.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.637
And I was going
to invite you out

20:06.639 --> 20:08.806
to climb mount Dominic
this weekend.

20:08.808 --> 20:09.874
We'll be there in the morning.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.576
Denny!

20:11.578 --> 20:13.711
We'll be there in the morning.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.379
Me and my friends.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.480
Your friends, too?

20:18.951 --> 20:22.386
Very well. If you insist.

20:23.922 --> 20:26.290
Graduate.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.725
I'll meet you up there
tomorrow evening

20:27.727 --> 20:30.661
for a little
post-climb celebration.

20:30.663 --> 20:34.398
Thank you, Uncle Billy.
Thank you.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.768
Sometimes you need your family
to help lift you up.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.571
And I can't think of a better
way for you to celebrate

20:40.573 --> 20:43.941
this phase of your life
than by proving to the world

20:43.943 --> 20:45.376
your scars have healed.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.547
Takes a lot of strength
to withstand

20:49.549 --> 20:52.817
ignorance and jealousy.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.919
Perhaps someday your
physical attributes

20:54.921 --> 20:56.487
will match your mental ones.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.924
I wish.

20:59.926 --> 21:03.928
Keep working hard,
and sometimes wishes come true.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.473
What are you doing?

21:15.475 --> 21:16.974
I'm texting Adam.
He's got the gear.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.096
And If we're gonna climb
tomorrow we're gonna need it.

21:20.579 --> 21:21.859
I'm still mad at you,
by the way.

21:33.725 --> 21:37.895

21:37.897 --> 21:41.799

Lisa? Have you lost
your freaking mind?

22:40.126 --> 22:41.826
What?

22:41.828 --> 22:44.028
Adam Says you're climbing
mount Dominic tomorrow.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.631
Oh, yeah.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.467
"Oh, yeah?"
Are you kidding me, Burke?

22:49.469 --> 22:51.502
You can barely stand as it is.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.070
I've been in
physical therapy for months.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.573
My... my therapist cleared me.
I'm okay.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.108
So instead of the one
in four chance

22:57.110 --> 22:59.777
you fall to your death,
It's all on the one in nine now?

22:59.779 --> 23:02.046
Congratulations, Denny.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.748
Whatever, Lisa.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.483
I'm going with you.
What?

23:05.485 --> 23:07.051
If you're determined
to hurt yourself,

23:07.053 --> 23:08.586
the least you can do
is have somebody

23:08.588 --> 23:10.454
with some
medical training around.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.022
Medical training?

23:12.024 --> 23:15.159
Having a doctor for a dad
and taking a first aid class

23:15.161 --> 23:17.762
hardly qualifies you
as medically trained, Lisa.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.463
I've already cleared it
with my parents.

23:20.932 --> 23:22.066
I'm going with you.

23:30.675 --> 23:31.776
Goodnight, Denny.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.734
I miss you, dad.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.157
Pc 40 headquarters,

24:20.159 --> 24:22.726
tell the mckenzies
there's no one on the roof.

24:22.728 --> 24:23.928
They're probably drunk again.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.033
<i>10-4.</i>

25:01.700 --> 25:03.767
Sir, those readings
you asked for.

25:05.036 --> 25:06.203
Sir?

25:08.907 --> 25:12.543
Never mind.
I see you're busy.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.157
What? No crutches?

25:27.159 --> 25:28.626
Oh, thanks for noticing.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.793
Ha, that's what's up, man.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.930
Here you are.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.598
Thanks, bro.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.934
By the way, thanks for
the Lisa alert last night.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.869
Look, I'm sorry, man,
she was already at your house

25:38.871 --> 25:40.151
before I could call
the code red.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.643
Ah, speak of the devil.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.912
Can I... Can I get some help?

25:47.914 --> 25:49.213
On it.

25:50.315 --> 25:51.649
Thanks, arch.

25:56.588 --> 25:58.088
Man, I'm going to miss this,
you know.

25:59.991 --> 26:02.760
What? My little brother
hitting on my ex-girlfriend?

26:02.762 --> 26:04.995
Nah, no.

26:04.997 --> 26:07.698
You know, hanging out
after high school.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.267
You know, going camping
with my friends on a whim.

26:12.837 --> 26:14.038
Watching your little brother
cop a feel

26:14.040 --> 26:15.706
on your ex-girlfriend.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.341
Archie. Hands.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.361
Dude, I was thinking
about this last night.

26:26.184 --> 26:28.919
This will probably
be the last time

26:28.921 --> 26:30.154
we can all hang out like this.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.857
You know, next month I go
to Florida for training

26:33.859 --> 26:35.660
and in three months
you're gonna be in school.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.129
And to tell you the truth
I'm not even sure

26:39.131 --> 26:41.899
I want to go to
college anymore.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.867
But what are you gonna do
If you don't go to school?

26:43.869 --> 26:46.203
Yeah...

26:46.205 --> 26:50.107
Hey. Um, interrupting
a bromance or something?

26:50.109 --> 26:52.276
No, not at all. Are you ready?
Yeah.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.178
Okay, Archie, give me the bag. You
look like you're about to fall over.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.047
No, no. I got it.
I got it.

27:01.052 --> 27:02.252
Come on, man.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.089
Let's go!

27:07.826 --> 27:09.693
Some help? No, no,
no, you got it.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.162
You're right there.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.304
What a champ!

27:24.309 --> 27:25.709
All right.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.115
What are you doing?

27:31.117 --> 27:33.283
Calling.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.418
Why don't you just
honk the horn?

27:34.420 --> 27:35.919
Her step-Dad'll
get pissed.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.025
Dude!

27:41.027 --> 27:42.393
What?
We're burning daylight here.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.298
Don't you walk away from me,
young lady.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.769
I want to see myself in that
linoleum floor before noon.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.811
You're a beer away from
sleeping on the floor, Earl.

27:58.143 --> 28:01.011
No... You'll listen
to me, Gwendolyn.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.781
I don't work hard all day so
you can go out whoring around

28:03.783 --> 28:05.115
with your loud friends.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.717
Stop it, you're hurting me.

28:06.719 --> 28:10.154
What are you gonna do?
Call the cops?

28:10.156 --> 28:13.824
Sheriff Desoto's
a friend of mine.

28:13.826 --> 28:16.760
If anything happens to you
I'll bet he'll vouch for me.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.295
I said stop it!

28:18.297 --> 28:20.964
Ouch! Fuck!

28:24.703 --> 28:26.036
Can we go? Fast-ish!

28:30.909 --> 28:33.944
Uh, you okay?

28:36.214 --> 28:37.347
It's fine.

28:40.218 --> 28:43.087
Hey, you guys,
why all the long faces?

28:43.089 --> 28:45.355
Come on,
we're officially on vacation.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.094
What happened to you, Brainiac?

28:50.096 --> 28:52.129
You should see the other guy.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.064

28:54.066 --> 28:55.265

What is this?

30:39.872 --> 30:41.004
You'll see.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.886
Well, it looks like you
can still get in here.

31:29.654 --> 31:30.988
Go ahead, little bro.

31:40.965 --> 31:44.201
Man, I can't believe Uncle
Billy bought all of this land,

31:44.203 --> 31:47.070
and he isn't doing
anything with it.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.205
Yeah.

31:49.941 --> 31:51.508
We had some pretty
great memories, huh?

31:52.610 --> 31:53.977
With mom and dad.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.147
Yeah.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.052
Hey, so, uh,

32:02.054 --> 32:04.588
it was cool seeing you stand up
to your old man back there.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.691
Step old man.
Yeah, he kind of sucks.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.961
Yeah, more than kind of.
Dude, but you... You were cool,

32:10.963 --> 32:13.263
you were like... Like wham,
you know.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.998
Like wonder woman cool.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.167
Yeah?

32:20.605 --> 32:22.506
Hey.

32:22.508 --> 32:25.342
Um, are we all alone out here?

32:25.344 --> 32:27.444
I think so. I don't think
anyone lives out here for Miles.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.179
Why?

32:29.181 --> 32:32.149
I don't know. Just...
I just got this weird feeling

32:32.151 --> 32:34.117
like we're being
watched or something.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.419
It's probably nothing.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.421
I can hold your hand
If you're scared.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.456
Guys, guys, guys,
I think we're forgetting.

32:40.591 --> 32:42.225
We're about to graduate soon.

32:44.028 --> 32:46.596
Besides Archie, but still.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.632
You know, at this moment
we should have no stress,

32:48.634 --> 32:50.000
not a care in the world.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.003
No one can stop us.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.500
Let's just go conquer
the Mountain.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.476
I like where your head's at.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.645
What have we got to be
scared of? Let's do this thing.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.317
That's a big ass Mountain.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.085
Archie, language.

33:42.087 --> 33:44.087
Okay.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.555
Still a big ass Mountain.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.493
So how's your face?

33:49.495 --> 33:51.261
My lip is fine.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.763
"My lip is fine."

33:52.765 --> 33:54.097
Just look at those...

33:56.401 --> 33:58.301
hey, you got a sec?

33:58.303 --> 33:59.469
Sure.

34:01.172 --> 34:02.472
How's your leg?

34:03.374 --> 34:05.242
Shaky.
Yeah?

34:05.244 --> 34:06.643
I'm supposed
to be ready for this,

34:06.645 --> 34:08.277
but I don't know.
No, You'll be great.

34:10.114 --> 34:12.114
Yeah, well,

34:12.117 --> 34:13.315
why is the Mountain there?

34:14.252 --> 34:15.685
To be conquered.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.721
You guys have said
that like six times today.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.688
It's what my dad always
used to say

34:19.690 --> 34:22.059
when he taught me to climb.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.159
Oh.

34:25.362 --> 34:26.463
So,

34:27.598 --> 34:28.732
I was wondering,

34:29.833 --> 34:33.770
since I might not come back

34:33.772 --> 34:35.304
from this thing

34:35.306 --> 34:36.840
which is what everyone
wants to hear.

34:38.476 --> 34:39.775
Why did we break up?

34:45.283 --> 34:46.817
Denny, I had my reasons.

34:48.686 --> 34:50.487
Which were?

34:50.489 --> 34:52.289
You know, I don't think
this is the best time

34:52.291 --> 34:54.257
to be talking about this.
You should be getting ready...

34:54.259 --> 34:56.359
no, I think this is a perfectly
good time actually.

34:59.864 --> 35:01.598
If you want to talk,

35:01.600 --> 35:03.667
let's talk about
that brace on your leg

35:03.669 --> 35:06.436
and how it got there
in the first place.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.606
Denny, we dated for six months.

35:09.608 --> 35:13.176
You wouldn't tell me anything.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.445
I-I mean,
I know it bothers you, okay,

35:15.447 --> 35:16.813
so I didn't press it, but...

35:16.815 --> 35:18.115
Oh...

35:19.717 --> 35:21.251
I had my reasons.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.488
Cute.

35:24.490 --> 35:25.722
Wait.

35:28.459 --> 35:29.693
What?

35:31.229 --> 35:32.362
You know horseshoe canyon?

35:33.798 --> 35:35.165
Where you used to climb?
Right.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.870
My dad and I were climbing
together there

35:39.872 --> 35:41.204
for my birthday.

35:42.173 --> 35:44.674
We were half way up the face

35:44.676 --> 35:46.576
and there was
this big explosion.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.311
What?

35:48.313 --> 35:49.746
We fell.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.882
And when the smoke cleared I was

35:51.884 --> 35:54.251
really hurt bad,

35:54.253 --> 35:56.153
like spinal damage.

35:56.155 --> 36:00.323
And my dad was... Was fine,

36:00.325 --> 36:01.491
for a while.

36:02.793 --> 36:04.427
I had to get a lot
of surgeries.

36:04.429 --> 36:05.695
For the first couple of months

36:05.697 --> 36:07.864
my mom and Archie
always took me in.

36:07.866 --> 36:11.334
My dad had something
to work on.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.570
Something to make me better.

36:15.306 --> 36:16.986
But one day we just came
from the hospital,

36:18.743 --> 36:20.210
and dad had cleared out.

36:21.612 --> 36:25.682
No note, no phone call,
no text message.

36:25.684 --> 36:26.883
Nothing. Just gone.

36:28.886 --> 36:31.388
Denny, I'm so sorry.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.790
But, I didn't want
to tell you because

36:33.792 --> 36:36.826
I didn't want my dad leaving
to screw up our relationship.

36:41.832 --> 36:45.835
So, I'm gonna go
climb this Mountain,

36:46.871 --> 36:48.505
and I might not come back.

36:50.608 --> 36:51.741
Why did we break up?

36:55.513 --> 36:56.680
I'll tell you what,

36:59.383 --> 37:01.484
come back down the Mountain
in one piece

37:01.486 --> 37:02.652
and I'll tell you.

37:04.288 --> 37:05.655
Really?

37:05.657 --> 37:07.557
After all that,
that's what I get?

37:07.559 --> 37:09.559
I need to give you a good reason
to come back down.

37:10.661 --> 37:11.828
You promise?

37:13.664 --> 37:15.232
Cross my heart and hope to fly.

37:16.834 --> 37:18.802
Hope to die.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.003
Who hopes for that?

37:24.842 --> 37:26.943
That's a pretty long
first pitch.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.546
Oh, we've definitely climbed
higher than that before.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.514
Yeah. You think you'd
like to take it?

37:31.516 --> 37:32.749
Yeah, It's a little stiff
without the brace

37:32.751 --> 37:33.883
but I'm sure I'll be fine.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.885
Okay, belay on, dude.
You ready?

37:35.887 --> 37:37.587
Yup. All right, let's get it.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.856
Hey, Denny, don't fall.

37:39.858 --> 37:43.426
Don't worry
I won't. Mom.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.362
You got it.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.596
All right.
All right.

37:48.599 --> 37:49.799
You good?
Uh-huh.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.081
All right, you got it, man.

37:56.340 --> 37:57.674
Whoo!

37:57.676 --> 37:58.708
Oh!

37:58.710 --> 38:00.677
Aah!

38:02.880 --> 38:04.014
Thank you.

38:07.585 --> 38:08.818
No problem.

39:05.609 --> 39:07.711
Hey, yo, keep that smile up.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.546
I can't believe you brought
these all the way up here.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.468
They're your favorite, man.
We have to celebrate.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.818
Where did you say the girls
were picking us up again?

39:14.820 --> 39:16.553
Well, we're going to
go over this Ridge

39:16.555 --> 39:18.955
and meet them at a small
road that's up there.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.024
How's your leg feeling?
Pretty stiff.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.926
I do not savor the idea of
walking down the Mountain.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.494
Well, that's why we got a ride.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.865
I'm gonna miss you next year,
man.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.800
Yeah, what were you saying
about not going to school?

39:30.802 --> 39:32.569
I don't know. I...

39:32.571 --> 39:35.505
I always hate the thought
of being away from you guys.

39:35.507 --> 39:38.108
Yeah. It stinks you can't
be in two places at once.

39:38.110 --> 39:39.442
I know. Weak.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.546
Is that a lake?

39:43.548 --> 39:46.015
Yeah. It's over by that dam
my Uncle Billy owns.

39:49.620 --> 39:50.887
Everything's set?

39:50.889 --> 39:53.623
Do I look like one
of your lab geeks?

39:53.625 --> 39:56.426
No, you look like someone
who's got a job to do.

39:56.428 --> 39:59.896
And right now that job's to make
sure that subject is in place.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.731
Now, is everything set?

40:09.640 --> 40:11.908
<i>You don't know that</i>
<i>guy very well, do you?</i>

40:11.910 --> 40:12.976
No.

40:12.978 --> 40:16.513
Uncle Billy wasn't exactly
my dad's favorite person.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.481
So he wasn't really welcomed.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.550
I honestly forgot he existed
until the other day.

40:23.754 --> 40:26.055
Thanks for doing this
with me, Adam.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.524
Only one thing left to do.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.494
What's that?

40:31.496 --> 40:32.736
Let's go conquer that Mountain.

40:50.614 --> 40:51.714
What the heck is that?

40:55.686 --> 40:57.787
Full body scan initiated.

41:04.696 --> 41:06.029
Some help would be nice.

41:07.198 --> 41:09.032
Sir, we have a positive scan.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.733
The boy's activated
the accelerator.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.170
Sir.

41:15.172 --> 41:16.606
Where are you going?

41:16.608 --> 41:18.174
Orders.
But what If I need help?

41:18.176 --> 41:19.809
Everybody's down
in the other lab.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.211
If the machine goes off,
it could...

41:24.182 --> 41:27.183
Are the power safeguards
still in place?

41:28.720 --> 41:29.953
Uh-Oh.

41:29.955 --> 41:32.522
Whoa.

41:32.524 --> 41:33.690
Whoa. Hey!

41:42.867 --> 41:44.000
Lisa!

41:51.008 --> 41:52.275
Denny.

41:53.210 --> 41:54.511
Aah!

42:03.053 --> 42:04.153
Denny!

42:19.603 --> 42:22.539
Gwen! Gwen, wake up!

42:22.541 --> 42:24.774
My seatbelt, It's stuck!
I can't get it undone!

42:28.279 --> 42:30.179
Pull!

42:30.181 --> 42:31.581
Ugh!

42:37.254 --> 42:39.656
Denny is not gonna
be happy about this.

42:39.658 --> 42:40.957
What just happened?

42:40.959 --> 42:43.192
Something big like
an earthquake maybe.

42:43.194 --> 42:44.961
It seemed like
something bigger.

42:46.064 --> 42:49.299
Guys.

42:49.301 --> 42:50.333
What happened to you?

42:50.335 --> 42:51.801
I just ran down.

42:51.803 --> 42:53.336
Adam?

42:53.338 --> 42:54.971
I wasn't fast enough.

42:59.009 --> 43:01.878
Denny! Denny!
Denny! Denny! Denny! Denny!

43:03.881 --> 43:05.615
He won't wake up.

43:05.617 --> 43:08.017
We need to get him to a hospital
as quick as possible.

43:08.019 --> 43:09.919
But we're Miles away
from everywhere.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.441
I'll call my dad.
We'll get an airlift.

43:12.990 --> 43:15.725
I don't have any service.
Anybody else?

43:15.727 --> 43:17.226
I left my phone in the car.

43:19.597 --> 43:20.997
Okay, we're gonna have
to carry him out.

43:20.999 --> 43:23.633
Uh, we're gonna have
to build a stretcher.

43:23.635 --> 43:25.068
I need to stop this bleeding.

43:25.070 --> 43:26.936
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

43:26.938 --> 43:29.939
I haven't studied that yet.
I know about quantum mechanics.

43:29.941 --> 43:33.109
Archie, Archie,
you need to calm down, okay?

43:33.111 --> 43:34.243
Your brother...

43:35.913 --> 43:38.181
Denny needs you
right now to be strong.

43:38.183 --> 43:40.083
So take a deep breath,
and calm down, okay?

43:43.087 --> 43:45.288
I need... I need you to help
me make some tourniquets.

43:45.290 --> 43:46.889
Adam and Archie
take down the tent

43:46.891 --> 43:49.392
and We'll make a stretcher
out of the poles.

43:49.394 --> 43:50.693
Go!

43:56.100 --> 43:57.300
Don't you die on me, Burke.

44:12.716 --> 44:14.717
Archie, what are you...
how are you do...

44:16.787 --> 44:18.087
what's going on?

44:18.089 --> 44:19.322
Uncle Billy?

44:20.391 --> 44:21.991
What happened to Denny?

44:21.993 --> 44:24.327
He was climbing and he fell.

44:24.329 --> 44:26.129
We need to get him
to my compound quickly.

44:26.131 --> 44:28.231
We can transport him
to a hospital from there.

44:33.003 --> 44:35.004
Timothy, come help the children.

44:35.006 --> 44:36.806
My driver.
Timothy?

44:36.808 --> 44:38.775
My eyesight doesn't allow
me to drive at night.

44:39.877 --> 44:41.044
Door.

44:41.046 --> 44:43.046
Are we all gonna
to fit back there?

44:43.048 --> 44:46.416
You stay here, We'll take Denny,
call for an airlift.

44:46.418 --> 44:48.751
I'll have Timothy come back
and pick you up.

44:48.753 --> 44:50.019
No! I'm going with him!

44:50.021 --> 44:51.988
Lisa, Denny will be fine.

44:51.990 --> 44:53.456
Someone needs to be there
to keep pressure

44:53.458 --> 44:54.757
on his wounds in case he...

44:54.759 --> 44:56.359
Archie should go, he's family.

44:56.361 --> 44:57.760
Hey!

44:57.762 --> 44:59.195
Can we stop arguing about this?

44:59.197 --> 45:00.763
In cases of massive trauma,

45:00.765 --> 45:02.525
the first few minutes
are the most important.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.902
I'll take care of him, arch.
You better.

45:21.285 --> 45:22.318
Hey, where are you going?

45:22.320 --> 45:23.886
To work on Denny's car.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.288
I'm not gonna sit here
and wait around

45:25.290 --> 45:27.290
for Tim the driver man
to come get us.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.100
How much further?

45:38.402 --> 45:39.902
Not long, dear.

45:45.776 --> 45:47.043
What is this place?

45:49.446 --> 45:51.047
Is it a good idea to move him?

45:54.318 --> 45:58.020
We keep a small medical
facility here for my staff.

45:58.022 --> 45:59.583
My men will be right
out to collect him.

46:04.361 --> 46:06.863
Are they even doctors?
Hello?

46:06.865 --> 46:09.031
You are exhibiting signs
of shock miss Thompson.

46:09.033 --> 46:10.933
I'd like to run some tests
on you, make sure...

46:10.935 --> 46:14.804
What? No! No!
Denny! Let go! Stop!

46:14.806 --> 46:16.372
We'll look after Denny,
he's gonna be fine.

46:16.374 --> 46:18.074
All right, we're hot.

46:18.076 --> 46:20.409
Exposure to zero energy
was roughly half an hour ago.

46:20.411 --> 46:23.212
Boss wants full scans
on all wavelengths and an m.R.I.

46:23.214 --> 46:25.782
We need to find out
what's going on inside this kid.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.049
Take that stick out of him.

46:31.221 --> 46:32.522
Doctor, something is happening.

46:34.391 --> 46:35.458
He's spiking.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.959
Give me some epinephrine

46:57.214 --> 46:58.548
what happened?

47:02.820 --> 47:03.920
Where am I?

47:07.257 --> 47:09.058
Interesting!

47:19.369 --> 47:20.837
She's regaining consciousness.

47:20.839 --> 47:22.371
Where am I?

47:22.373 --> 47:23.840
Let's get her back into it now.

47:23.842 --> 47:26.108
You're fine, dear.
No! Where's Denny? Where am I?

47:26.110 --> 47:27.977
We're just running some tests.
There was an accident.

47:27.979 --> 47:29.946
I said I want her
back in there, now!

47:29.948 --> 47:31.314
Where are they? Where's Denny?

47:33.150 --> 47:34.217
Where's Denny?

47:34.219 --> 47:35.484
Just go to sleep now, dear.

47:42.060 --> 47:43.426
<i>You think</i>
<i>they're gonna be all right?</i>

47:43.428 --> 47:44.861
<i>What?</i>

47:44.863 --> 47:46.195
That wood in his chest
probably stopped

47:46.197 --> 47:47.964
something important
from coming out.

47:49.333 --> 47:50.499
He'll be all right, right?

47:50.501 --> 47:52.034
Sure, Archie.
No.

47:52.036 --> 47:54.537
Gwen. What good is lying to him?

47:54.539 --> 47:56.505
He's smarter than
you and me combined, Adam.

47:56.507 --> 47:57.974
He can handle the truth.

47:57.976 --> 47:59.876
Oh! We need to accept the fact

47:59.878 --> 48:01.377
that Denny might be... <i>dead?</i>

48:01.379 --> 48:02.645
Timothy.

48:02.647 --> 48:05.248
Is Denny...
he's stable.

48:05.250 --> 48:08.117
And I'm here to take you
to your Uncle.

48:08.119 --> 48:10.319
That's like the second time
you snuck up on us.

48:10.321 --> 48:12.054
I am almost done,
We'll follow you.

48:12.056 --> 48:15.157
Yeah, I'd much rather
you ride with me.

48:15.159 --> 48:18.261
And I'd much rather we get
this heap running into the shop

48:18.263 --> 48:20.096
instead of towing it
back to civilization.

48:20.098 --> 48:23.633
Please, get in the car,
children.

48:23.635 --> 48:25.101
I won't ask nicely again.

48:26.570 --> 48:27.730
And what If we don't want to?

48:31.675 --> 48:34.043
You won't like me very much
by the time I'm done.

48:35.178 --> 48:36.612
I don't like you very much now.

48:36.614 --> 48:38.414
Guys, can we just get
in the car.

48:38.416 --> 48:41.584
I want to see... Denny.

48:41.586 --> 48:44.453
Archie!
Why'd you do that?

48:47.624 --> 48:49.992
You guys going
to come willingly?

48:49.994 --> 48:52.328
Or you have to make this
a whole thing?

48:52.330 --> 48:54.463
Oh, mister,
you just made a mistake.

49:00.404 --> 49:02.004
Gwen, go!

49:07.311 --> 49:08.644
Oh! Ah!

49:10.247 --> 49:11.380
Ah!

49:30.367 --> 49:32.468
Don't worry, you and your
ugly little girlfriend

49:32.470 --> 49:34.003
are gonna be just fine.

49:34.705 --> 49:36.439
Ah!

49:52.322 --> 49:53.990
This is Finch to base.
I've lost...

49:55.759 --> 49:57.293
right.

49:59.029 --> 50:01.097
Ah! Well, kid.

50:02.532 --> 50:04.066
I hope you like the height.

50:05.535 --> 50:07.470
Ah! Oh!

50:07.472 --> 50:09.638
Jeez
you're heavier than you look.

50:23.553 --> 50:25.688
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

50:25.690 --> 50:29.792
Uh, I was, uh,
looking for the bathroom?

50:29.794 --> 50:32.361
Hey, hey the canon is loose.
Hey! Hey!

50:38.802 --> 50:41.170
Ah!

50:50.480 --> 50:51.814
Denny, get in!

50:58.222 --> 51:00.122
This had better be
important, doctor.

51:00.124 --> 51:01.524
If you haven't heard
the security alarms,

51:01.526 --> 51:03.192
we're having quite the hour.

51:03.194 --> 51:06.162
This is good.
This is better than good.

51:06.164 --> 51:08.297
We did it.
We did what?

51:08.299 --> 51:12.635
Well, uh, as we saw
in our earlier experiments

51:12.637 --> 51:14.103
the human body can't take
a direct exposure

51:14.105 --> 51:15.738
to zero energy.

51:15.740 --> 51:17.840
It's just not equipped. I mean,
it can cause lifelong issues...

51:17.842 --> 51:19.809
I know, doctor,
I was there the first time.

51:19.811 --> 51:21.444
Get to the point.

51:21.446 --> 51:24.080
Well, Denny's d.N.A.
Is the closest we could get

51:24.082 --> 51:26.449
to postman zero's genetic code.

51:26.451 --> 51:29.318
But somehow the boy absorbed
the energy and expelled it,

51:29.320 --> 51:31.087
hitting his friends.

51:31.089 --> 51:33.489
So we were testing this girl
to see If we could extract

51:33.491 --> 51:34.690
that altered energy.

51:34.692 --> 51:36.225
And?

51:36.227 --> 51:37.860
Well it was totally by accident,

51:37.862 --> 51:40.463
but we got something
a lot better.

51:40.465 --> 51:41.697
Let me show you.

51:45.335 --> 51:47.136
What am I looking at?

51:47.138 --> 51:50.139
Okay, right now, we're sending
small electrical impulses

51:50.141 --> 51:52.408
to her primary motor cortex.

51:52.410 --> 51:55.177
We are causing her to move.

51:55.179 --> 51:58.147
But, with the right amount
of electricity...

52:05.222 --> 52:06.622
Is she?

52:06.624 --> 52:08.257
That's right, Mr. Burke,

52:08.259 --> 52:09.758
because of her exposure
to zero energy

52:11.795 --> 52:13.129
this girl can fly.

52:31.781 --> 52:33.282
Are they still following us?

52:34.885 --> 52:37.386
Nah, I think we're clear. Good.

52:37.388 --> 52:39.855
Don't you ever fall off the
Mountain again. Hey. Hey.

52:39.857 --> 52:42.224
You scared the crap out of us.

52:42.226 --> 52:44.460
And how are you okay right now?

52:44.462 --> 52:47.196
I saw you Denny.
You looked dead.

52:47.198 --> 52:48.564
You should be dead.

52:48.566 --> 52:49.865
I don't know.

52:51.268 --> 52:54.236
There was a machine
on the Mountain top.

52:54.238 --> 52:56.772
It shot a beam
of light into me,

52:56.774 --> 52:58.407
and then I woke up
back there fine.

53:01.745 --> 53:04.713
I...I mean,
look at my leg.

53:04.715 --> 53:07.816
It's... It's completely healed.

53:07.818 --> 53:10.386
I was in physical therapy
for over a year,

53:10.388 --> 53:12.755
and I just woke up
back there totally whole.

53:12.757 --> 53:14.523
And you think this machine
did that to you?

53:14.525 --> 53:17.660
Or those guys did.

53:17.662 --> 53:18.794
We've got to call
the police or something.

53:18.796 --> 53:20.362
Do you have a phone?
Ow!

53:20.364 --> 53:23.666
What? The stupid
glove box has a...

53:23.668 --> 53:24.900
What did they do to me?

53:28.772 --> 53:30.606
Ah, Gwen.

53:33.276 --> 53:34.637
Where did you say
you got this car?

53:36.246 --> 53:37.613
Where is everybody else?

53:37.615 --> 53:39.215
We need to talk
about your Uncle, Denny.

53:40.717 --> 53:43.419
We're following them
discreetly?

53:43.421 --> 53:44.753
They don't even know
we're there.

53:47.624 --> 53:49.758
Patch in to the car's Bluetooth,

53:49.760 --> 53:51.961
I want to hear
their conversation.

53:51.963 --> 53:54.897
Sir, should we have
let the candidate go?

53:58.301 --> 54:00.469
There is a method to my madness.

54:05.375 --> 54:07.009
Where's Mr. Finch?

54:07.011 --> 54:09.011
Still not back, sir.

54:09.013 --> 54:11.513
I was gonna send him a ride.

54:11.515 --> 54:12.748
Don't bother.

54:15.452 --> 54:17.820
I don't reward incompetence.

54:17.822 --> 54:19.321
Yes, sir.

54:33.570 --> 54:35.604
What the hell are they
feeding you, kid?

54:35.606 --> 54:36.872
Rocks?

54:38.875 --> 54:40.609
Come out now
and I won't hurt you.

54:42.846 --> 54:44.046
Anymore.

54:45.482 --> 54:46.715
I got to tell you
I could use your help

54:46.717 --> 54:47.997
carrying your
little friend here.

54:53.857 --> 54:55.524
How do I know
you just won't kill us?

54:56.893 --> 54:58.827
Think about it, genius.

54:58.829 --> 55:00.462
Would I have carried
this kid this far

55:00.464 --> 55:01.664
If my orders were to kill you?

55:02.866 --> 55:07.403
No, I was sent to retrieve you.

55:08.571 --> 55:10.506
Retrieve us? For what?

55:12.776 --> 55:14.476
I don't know.

55:14.478 --> 55:16.438
Maybe for that little trick
you pulled back there?

55:17.547 --> 55:21.517
I mean, poof.
You disappeared.

55:21.519 --> 55:23.639
I was on top of you and then
you were nothing but air.

55:25.488 --> 55:27.523
How did you do that?

55:32.329 --> 55:33.429
What did you do with Denny?

55:35.865 --> 55:38.000
Besides from being named
Denny, he's just fine.

55:40.070 --> 55:41.370
Took him to base.

55:48.378 --> 55:50.846
So, I guess you know
how I did that then.

55:52.015 --> 55:56.418
That... Teleporting thing?

55:56.420 --> 55:57.619
No.

55:59.389 --> 56:03.125
Hell, son, we're the ones
that gave you that ability.

56:04.728 --> 56:06.248
You know, we thought
Denny was the key.

56:07.664 --> 56:08.897
But, maybe It's you.

56:13.002 --> 56:14.762
You know, we can teach you
how to control it.

56:16.539 --> 56:17.740
Hone it,

56:19.376 --> 56:21.056
and then when your
power's at its greatest,

56:22.912 --> 56:24.046
use it for what we need.

56:25.448 --> 56:27.916
Hey. I think I got
the hang of it.

56:29.152 --> 56:32.020
Ah!
Ha, ha, two points.

56:32.022 --> 56:33.389
Okay.

56:38.762 --> 56:40.896
Come on, kid.

56:40.898 --> 56:43.799
You wouldn't shoot
an unarmed man, right?

56:43.801 --> 56:46.668
I mean, let's face it,
you don't have the...

56:50.607 --> 56:51.940
balls.

56:53.009 --> 56:54.443
Now that's for calling her ugly.

56:56.814 --> 56:58.480
<i>I can't believe that.</i>

56:58.482 --> 57:02.050
I do. Your Uncle sent
some guy out to kidnap us.

57:02.052 --> 57:05.454
Who knows what he's doing
to your brother, or Lisa.

57:05.456 --> 57:06.688
Think about it.

57:06.690 --> 57:09.658
He gives you
this graduation present,

57:09.660 --> 57:12.494
and then sends you out
into the middle of nowhere.

57:12.496 --> 57:14.830
And then zaps you
with some machine

57:14.832 --> 57:17.833
that does God knows
what to you.

57:17.835 --> 57:20.436
He knew you guys would be
coming along. I told him.

57:20.438 --> 57:22.871
Why would he let me bring my
friends If I was the experiment?

57:22.873 --> 57:24.913
Wouldn't he want to keep
that a secret or something?

57:26.643 --> 57:27.943
Hey, look over there.

57:38.655 --> 57:40.088
Are you sure about this?

57:40.090 --> 57:42.658
Gwen, we've got
to call the police.

57:42.660 --> 57:44.960
I know, but here?

57:44.962 --> 57:46.995
It's the only place for Miles.

57:46.997 --> 57:49.231
Yeah, just hurry.

57:49.233 --> 57:50.666
Okay.

58:01.945 --> 58:05.013
<i>♪ I've got signs</i>
<i>and signifiers ♪</i>

58:05.015 --> 58:07.716
<i>♪ gossipers and liars</i>

58:07.718 --> 58:11.653
<i>♪ twist me every way</i>
<i>they wanna go ♪</i>

58:11.655 --> 58:13.188
Hey, you can't be in here.

58:13.190 --> 58:14.690
I need to use your phone.

58:14.692 --> 58:16.492
The what?
The phone.

58:16.494 --> 58:17.893
Kid, get out of here.

58:17.895 --> 58:19.561
Denny, let's go.

58:19.563 --> 58:20.662
It's an emergency.

58:23.633 --> 58:26.101
You can use the phone
in my truck.

58:26.103 --> 58:27.769
Earl!

58:27.771 --> 58:31.907
You stole my step-daughter,
and you come to my bar.

58:31.909 --> 58:35.577
Hell, I had half a caddy out
looking for you, little morons.

58:35.579 --> 58:36.812
Earl, stop it!

58:36.814 --> 58:38.647
Sheriff Desoto
was going to get out

58:38.649 --> 58:41.250
his damn search chopper
to look for you guys.

58:43.820 --> 58:46.688
We went camping.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.991
Well, I hope you had
a good time, boy,

58:48.993 --> 58:50.826
because you're going
to camp your ass

58:50.828 --> 58:53.061
in a holding cell for a week.

58:53.063 --> 58:55.731
Maybe a month If
ed can swing it.

58:55.733 --> 58:58.233
Let go of him.
You're choking him.

58:58.235 --> 59:00.903
Missy, you just wait
till I get you home.

59:00.905 --> 59:02.237
You're not gonna have it easy.

59:05.575 --> 59:08.577
You're having trouble
breathing, bastard?

59:08.579 --> 59:10.078
Well, you should
have thought of that

59:10.080 --> 59:11.713
before you stole
my little girl.

59:13.650 --> 59:14.783
What the hell is that?

59:17.020 --> 59:19.588
Hey, that's sort of nice.

59:19.590 --> 59:22.224
Where'd you get this?
Did you steal it, too?

59:22.226 --> 59:25.027
Earl harland, you put
him down, right now!

59:25.029 --> 59:27.729
Yeah? What are you
going to do about it?

59:27.731 --> 59:30.933
Or I'll put you down like
the rabid dog that you are.

59:33.036 --> 59:35.604
Wait! You're on fire.

59:35.606 --> 59:36.872
Let go of him.

59:36.874 --> 59:39.107
I'll give you
to the count of three.

59:39.109 --> 59:42.611
One.
Gwen. Gwen.

59:42.613 --> 59:44.813
Two.
Stop. Stop.

59:46.082 --> 59:47.349
Three!

59:56.793 --> 59:59.661
What did I do?
What did I just do?

59:59.663 --> 01:00:01.363
Denny, what are we going to do?

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:03.599
I can't go back in there.
I just set him on fire.

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:04.967
We'll go to jail.
I don't know.

01:00:04.969 --> 01:00:07.736
If we don't do something,
he's gonna die.

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:10.305
No, no. No, no, no, no.
I... I didn't mean to do it.

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:12.674
I just saw him
threatening you and...

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:14.610
And then my hands
they started burning.

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:16.745
Gwen, stop.

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:17.913
Calm down.

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:20.282
I have an idea.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.254
What's going on out here?

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:30.225
Good lord, is that Earl?

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:31.893
Unless you want
to end up like him,

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:34.229
get inside, and call
an ambulance right now!

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:36.264
Okay, miss, take it easy.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:38.200
Nothing's the matter,
everything's cool.

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:41.737
We only have 10 minutes
until the cops get here.

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:43.672
Whatever you're going to do,
do it fast.

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:45.007
Mr. harland,

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:46.908
this might hurt.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.323
Denny.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:02.391
I'm okay.

01:01:02.393 --> 01:01:03.692
So is he.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.965
We got to go. Help me up.

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:11.433
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm...

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.037
If you ever,

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:17.706
ever think about touching me

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:20.842
or my mother again,
remember what just happened.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.377
Remember what I can do to you.

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:40.295
Morning, little dude.

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.198
What happened?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.067
Well, Timmy, the driver man,

01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:46.401
hit you with some
sort of tranquilizer.

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:48.270
Then dragged you
down the Mountain.

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:49.971
I followed you guys,
kicked his ass,

01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:51.106
and here we are.

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:55.043
How you feeling?

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.912
Sore. Yeah.

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:58.180
Hard to think.

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:01.983
Where's here?

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:03.452
Well, I took you
to the one place

01:02:03.454 --> 01:02:05.020
I knew they wanted to go.

01:02:05.022 --> 01:02:06.822
Where they took Lisa and Denny.

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:09.024
Uncle Billy said they were going
to take Denny to a hospital.

01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:10.959
Yeah, well, Tim the
driver said otherwise.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.491
Some pretty weird stuff
happened while you were asleep.

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:19.000
Like what?

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:20.368
Like...

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:25.207
How did you?

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:26.274
I don't know how it works,

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:27.476
and I don't know
how it happened,

01:02:27.478 --> 01:02:29.177
but I can do this.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:31.847
Oh! Hey.

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.850
Archie,
do you remember that light

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:37.085
that was on top of the Mountain?

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.054
I think... I think it
did something to us.

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:40.322
I think it changed us.

01:02:40.324 --> 01:02:42.157
Einstein theorized
that teleportation

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:43.759
was tied to quantum
entanglement,

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:45.527
but nothing like you're doing.

01:02:45.529 --> 01:02:47.129
How do you feel
when you teleport?

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:48.263
Do you feel
different every time?

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:51.433
Well, I feel fine.
I feel great!

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:53.001
You know,
I just... I just think about

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:55.437
where I want to go and
I focus and then...

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.940
Oh.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:01.877
I'm there.

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:03.044
Amazing!

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.480
Here you try.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.521
Not quite the same thing.

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:15.490
Uh. I don't know
what they did to us.

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:18.860
And all clues point
to these guys.

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:20.382
Let's go do some
breaking and entering.

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:34.309
Pull over.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.811
What? Why?

01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:37.013
Can you just pull over?
Please.

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:38.980
Okay.

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.056
Everything okay?

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:49.457
I just nearly killed
my step-dad,

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:50.959
do you think I'm okay?

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:55.564
I just need a minute.

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:04.973
Things were happening really,
really fast back there and...

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:09.578
I know this might sound weird,

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.547
but could you hold me?

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.152
Yeah, okay.

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:27.329
Earl's gonna be okay, Gwen.

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:30.265
I fixed him,

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.635
like you fix cars.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:35.337
People aren't cars, Denny.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.875
I just...

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:43.011
I just shot flames
from my hands.

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:46.014
You just saved a man's
life by concentrating.

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:48.516
Who are we?

01:04:48.518 --> 01:04:50.318
What have we become?

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.020
What you are, sweetie,

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:54.189
is in a whole lot of trouble.

01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:55.657
And don't even
think about using

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:58.426
that flame-on stuff on us.

01:04:58.428 --> 01:04:59.928
Let's go.

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:08.270
Who are you guys, anyway?

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:09.537
Huh?

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:11.940
Tell me.

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:16.344
Sir, they are contained.

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:17.545
Heading towards you now.

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:19.080
Who's that you're
talking to, huh?

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.282
Is that my Uncle?

01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:21.349
Tell me!

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:23.018
Say good night, kiddo.

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:44.472
Lisa.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:47.642
Gwen.

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:54.215
You're awake.

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.118
What did you do to her?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.687
Just ran some tests.

01:05:58.689 --> 01:06:00.288
I swear, If you hurt her
in any way

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.656
I'm gonna...
You'll what?

01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:06.094
You'll healed me!

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:09.030
We were unsure what
the postman energy

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:10.565
would do to your body.

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:13.702
And after your little
outburst in the operating room

01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:16.671
I decided to give
you some distance.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.440
And to make sure you
weren't going to be

01:06:18.442 --> 01:06:21.576
like your father and...

01:06:21.578 --> 01:06:23.645
Ka-boom!

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.147
My father?

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.382
Oh.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.420
He never told you
what happened?

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:37.258
How he crippled you?

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.727
His own son.

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:41.730
Dad!

01:06:41.732 --> 01:06:45.600
Postman zero,

01:06:45.602 --> 01:06:49.237
one in 25 billion.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.072
Your father is a...

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:54.576
True anomaly.

01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:57.178
Your father possessed

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.180
great power.

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:03.184
I was there the first time
it manifested.

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:09.024
Wait, what was that?

01:07:09.026 --> 01:07:10.658
Oh, maybe...

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.327
Maybe it was the boogeyman.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:13.628
Ooh!

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:15.497
Kevin, I'm serious,
I heard something.

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:18.566
Oh, come on, It's probably
some kid just playing pranks.

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:21.169
It's Halloween,
you're just spooking yourself.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:25.173
You sure?
Sure, I'm sure.

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:27.575
And, hey, If it was the
boogeyman, let him come.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:30.045
I'll always protect you,
little brother.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:32.080
Kevin!

01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:33.548
Kevin's body didn't
know what to do

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.316
with the zero energy so it

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:38.319
violently expelled it.

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:40.321
<i>Your father very nearly</i>

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:43.158
killed a young boy that night.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.492
Aah!

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.366
<i>I wanted to experiment on him.</i>

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:55.270
<i>See how far these</i>
<i>abilities could go.</i>

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:57.172
<i>He refused.</i>

01:07:57.174 --> 01:07:59.808
<i>He would hide his talents,</i>

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:02.210
<i>no matter the cost.</i>

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:04.079
<i>So I travelled the world,</i>

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:07.148
<i>recruiting like-minded</i>
<i>individuals to help me.</i>

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:10.385
<i>And we began a worldwide hunt</i>

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:14.322
<i>for potential</i>
<i>postman candidates.</i>

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.858
<i>We drained the</i>
<i>gene pool of those</i>

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.359
<i>who did not match our needs.</i>

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:20.828
<i>And then,</i>

01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:23.531
<i>i heard about your accident.</i>

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:25.600
<i>I reached out to Kevin,</i>

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:28.303
<i>offered help, guidance.</i>

01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:29.871
<i>He took me at my word.</i>

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:31.639
<i>The fool.</i>

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:35.643
<i>We built this to</i>
<i>contain Kevin's energies</i>

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:37.679
<i>in hope that we might</i>
<i>be able to replicate it</i>

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.314
<i>in someone else.</i>

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:47.421
Unfortunately,
because of my own

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.358
problems

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.426
it was not me.

01:08:52.429 --> 01:08:54.162
It was me.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:57.232
What none of us
could've anticipated

01:08:57.234 --> 01:08:58.832
was that the zero energy

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:00.702
filtered through you

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.470
and into your friends,

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.404
giving each one of them

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:05.874
different abilities.

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:08.376
So... So what you're saying
is you all turned me

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.845
and my friends
into super people?

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:12.546
Not for very long.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:17.185
With the advancements
that we've made

01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:20.755
in studying you
and your friends

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:24.591
as well as developing
my own cocktail,

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.430
I can siphon

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:32.600
the zero energy into me.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:33.768
Cocktail?

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:39.240
My own special mix.

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:46.413
It allows my body to
process the zero energy.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:48.750
And then what?
Rule the world?

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:50.318
No.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.787
Nothing so silly.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.625
If America is to
have Posthumans,

01:09:57.627 --> 01:09:59.527
so should any country

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:03.765
who wants to defend themselves.

01:10:03.767 --> 01:10:07.402
So you're gonna start
a super power cold war

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:09.637
and sell yourself to
the highest bidder?

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:18.246
And here I thought Archie
was the smart one.

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:19.881
It all just comes down
to money.

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:22.250
You're just a simple conman.

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:25.587
But I'll be an
exceptionally rich,

01:10:25.589 --> 01:10:26.854
intelligent,

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:29.657
and dangerous conman, Denny.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:32.594
The man I've strived to be.

01:10:32.596 --> 01:10:35.763
Unfortunately,
we're not entirely sure

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:37.732
what the transference process

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.934
will do to you teenagers.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:44.472
Death is a possibility.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.743
Start with the cheerleader.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.345
Wait! No!

01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:52.480
Lisa!

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.418
Working.

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:03.291
Give me more.

01:11:03.293 --> 01:11:05.560
Sir, If we turn up the
machine, we might kill her.

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:10.632
The man asked for more.

01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:11.866
Okay.

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:15.891
You can't always do
what you want.

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.677
Find him!

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:26.481
What?
I saw this on YouTube.

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.384
Archie, turn off the machine.

01:11:29.386 --> 01:11:32.453
Stay away from
the control panel, young man.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:34.956
I think I killed the off switch
when I hit that guy.

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:36.357
Get Lisa free.

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:11.492
That's really...

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.365
Ah!

01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:18.566
Oh, what a shame.

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:24.672
Basketball stars' careers
go with a bang.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:27.475
Sleeping beauty's not
even awake to see it.

01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:29.510
Guess who woke up.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.112
Ah!

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:42.357
You okay?

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:45.126
Sure. Typical weekend
for me, you know.

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.797
So,

01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:51.766
after we save the world
and all,

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:55.370
you think maybe

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:58.139
you and I could, you know...

01:12:58.141 --> 01:12:59.574
Yeah. Yeah!

01:12:59.576 --> 01:13:01.075
Yeah?
Yeah! We definitely could.

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.844
Cool.

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.752
So, you wanna...

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:13.488
Or we could...

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.124
We should...

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:17.492
Go search the perimeter.

01:13:17.494 --> 01:13:19.527
Yes! Totally, yes!

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:21.129
Search the perimeter.

01:13:21.131 --> 01:13:23.251
We gotta find a place for
everyone to get out of here.

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:30.705
How'd you find us?

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:33.474
We snuck in and followed
everyone else.

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:35.810
Heard about Uncle Billy's
mad sciency plan.

01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:40.915
Is she...

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:43.851
She's dead.

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.861
Where is my brother?

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:11.145
Denny! Where's dad?

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:12.647
Dad left.

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:15.650
Four, five, six. Again.

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:21.155
Hey, guys, we could really
use some help out there.

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:23.157
Arch, go with him.

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.826
What... What am I supposed to do?

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:26.894
I can't stop what I'm doing.

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:27.995
Here.

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.836
Those steel bindings were...

01:14:34.838 --> 01:14:37.238
You tore through them like
they were coke cans.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.040
You've got strength now,
Archie.

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:40.708
The bad guys get in our path,

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:45.246
Denny, I'm sorry for
being such an ass...

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:46.948
Language, buddy. Now go.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:52.854
Lisa, I need you to wake up.

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:55.857
I never got to tell you
that... I... I need you.

01:14:55.859 --> 01:14:57.258
I never got to tell you
when we were together.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.660
And you picked me up
when I was at my lowest,

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:01.496
when I was ready to give up.

01:15:01.498 --> 01:15:03.631
And I'll never forgive myself
for letting you break up with me

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:06.033
and all that stupid stuff
that happened afterwards.

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:07.969
So can... Can you just
wake up for me

01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:10.037
so that I can tell you all that?

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:13.174
Come on, Lisa. Come on. Wake up.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:15.243
Wake up. Wake up.

01:15:15.245 --> 01:15:16.911
Five. Four...

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:19.614
Ugh!

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:38.766
Back for more?

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:41.002
Hey, were you gonna
ask me on a date back there?

01:15:41.004 --> 01:15:43.571
Oh, well maybe If you play
your cards right.

01:15:43.573 --> 01:15:44.839
Aah!

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:50.311
Are you all right?

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:51.679
Arch.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:53.781
I just caught a bullet.

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.950
There should be
a hole in my hand.

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:57.184
I just caught a bullet.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.320
Watch this.

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:07.662
Gwen, now.

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:14.335
Please. Please, Lisa, wake up.

01:16:14.337 --> 01:16:17.238
I would give anything for you
to wake up right now. Come on.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:23.110
♪ We still have energy in us

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:25.613
come on, Lisa, If I have
to give up everything I will.

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:32.887
<i>♪ There's so much</i>
<i>energy in us ♪</i>

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:43.664
<i>♪ there's so much</i>
<i>energy in us ♪</i>

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.834
It worked.

01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:49.270
Denny. Denny.

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:52.106
I heard you. Wherever
I was, I heard you.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.675
I love you.

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:55.876
I love you.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:03.618
Yo, we got to go.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.786
Somebody triggered
the self-destruct sequence.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.054
Help me walk.

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.733
- You're alive!
- What happened?

01:17:18.735 --> 01:17:20.334
Long story.

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:23.270
Okay, so, Uncle Billy needs
his next fix of zero energy

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:25.106
but he couldn't get it from us.

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:27.875
But dad went after him, too,
so where else could he have...

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:33.080
Oh.
Yeah.

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:34.982
Oh?
What do you mean Oh?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:37.084
He went where he knew
there was spare zero energy.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.387
Back where it all started.

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:52.133
Are you sure you
want to do this?

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:53.901
I mean, you saw those roads,

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:56.170
this is now the only
way up the Mountain.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:57.738
We're the only ones
who can stop Uncle Billy.

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.306
No one else can.

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:01.842
Adam, do you think you can
teleport Denny up the Mountain?

01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:03.878
No, no,
it doesn't work like that.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.112
I tried to carry
Archie earlier,

01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:06.594
but I can't take
other people with me.

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:08.849
Come on.

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:20.394
Okay, this is the fastest way.

01:18:20.396 --> 01:18:22.029
Dude, you don't have any gear.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:23.264
It doesn't matter,
Archie's going to carry me.

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:25.266
I'm gonna what?

01:18:25.268 --> 01:18:26.934
But I've never even
climbed before.

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:28.102
Why is the Mountain there?

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:29.770
So it can be conquered, but...

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:31.706
Dude, you're basically
superman right now.

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.107
You got this.
And I'll be with you.

01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:34.549
I'll coach you
every step of the way.

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:37.178
I need your help.

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.540
Sometimes the older brother's
gotta lean on the younger one.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:41.716
All right.

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:45.086
Got him?

01:18:45.088 --> 01:18:47.021
Yeah. He's pretty light.

01:18:47.023 --> 01:18:48.789
Of course he is when
you're so strong.

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:53.094
You are such a cheerleader.

01:18:53.096 --> 01:18:55.062
Right, I'm gonna be all
over this cliff face.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:56.397
So If you need me just scream.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.399
Don't worry,
If something goes wrong

01:18:58.401 --> 01:18:59.500
You'll hear the scream.

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:00.801
Oh, you got this.

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:02.737
Up, up and away.

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:04.004
William.

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:08.242
Looking well rested, brother.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:10.244
You used me.

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:11.812
Like I use everyone.

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:15.082
Life's more fun that way.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:17.084
Stop what you're doing.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.352
Stop?

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.255
I've only just begun.

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:30.931
I don't think so.

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:35.936
Hey, Denny?
Yeah?

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.338
We found dad.

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:41.008
All I ever wanted was
to be something more.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.244
Something bigger
than what I was.

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:47.281
Yet,

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:51.318
evolution found you first.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.487
And you didn't even want it.

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:56.190
I didn't choose
this life for myself.

01:19:56.192 --> 01:19:58.292
William, you had a
chance to be normal.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:00.861
To live without constantly
putting your family in danger.

01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:04.832
I didn't want a family!

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:10.971
Sometimes a family finds you
whether you want them or not.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:12.239
And for the record,
I think you'd make

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:14.175
a very terrible father figure.

01:20:14.177 --> 01:20:15.376
Boys!

01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:16.510
Dad.

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:22.583
So.

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:24.819
What's it going to be,
Uncle Billy?

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:26.887
You're gonna take
some responsibility?

01:20:26.889 --> 01:20:28.155
Or fight?

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:36.831
Why do I waste
my energy on you?

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.601
Look at you.

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:43.003
The zero energy
didn't want you either.

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:47.575
And I don't need you anymore.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.901
Denny!

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:36.090
Archie, do you think you can
hack the machine and reverse it?

01:21:36.092 --> 01:21:37.358
Let me go.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.059
I...I don't know. Maybe.

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:40.541
Use that brain
and figure it out, man.

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:48.903
I used to protect you
from everything.

01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:52.439
Bullies, our horrible father.

01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:55.109
But now I just want to
throw you to the wolves.

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:57.177
Uh, I think I did it.

01:21:57.179 --> 01:21:58.612
Throw the switch, Archie.

01:21:58.614 --> 01:22:00.681
Dad!
Throw the switch now!

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:11.492
Betsy Jessica barnet.

01:22:14.964 --> 01:22:16.597
Whoo!

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:19.033
This is going to take forever.

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:21.402
You're just mad you're
not walking with them.

01:22:21.404 --> 01:22:23.237
I can still fry you, you know.

01:22:23.239 --> 01:22:25.940
Hey, fry me and I won't tutor
you for summer school.

01:22:25.942 --> 01:22:27.541
<i>Dennis Nathaniel Burke.</i>

01:22:27.543 --> 01:22:29.977
Go Denny!
Oh, there he is.

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:43.624
Still need to learn
to control that.

01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:44.959
Yeah.

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:50.130
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:53.200
I present the graduating class
of pellian city high school.

01:22:57.006 --> 01:22:58.339
<i>Okay, so everyone smile.</i>

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:02.242
Say, zero energy.

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:06.613
I mean, cheese.

01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:08.248
Cheese.

01:23:09.418 --> 01:23:10.584
All right.

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:12.052
Thank you.

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:25.332
So, are you excited

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:28.002
about going back
to work at the shop?

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:29.503
It's a good job,
and it should tie me over

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.205
until I can make
enough money to move.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:38.112
So...

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.481
Where are you moving?

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:43.150
I hear Florida's nice.

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:46.153
And until then you're
just gonna have to

01:23:46.155 --> 01:23:48.288
port back and forth to see me.

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:50.557
No, I don't know If I can
come back every weekend.

01:23:50.559 --> 01:23:54.595
Oh, don't worry,
I'll put a fire under you.

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:56.397
<i>So we going</i>
<i>to that party later, man?</i>

01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:58.600
For sure. You definitely have
to hit me up about that...

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:03.470
I'm so sorry.
I... I'm sorry.

01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:05.506
Hey, genius.

01:24:05.508 --> 01:24:09.276
You know what, my bad.

01:24:09.278 --> 01:24:10.711
Free punch. Okay?

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:15.816
Yeah.
Ready. Ready?

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:24.091
Ah!

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:28.128
Dude!

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:40.707
Um,
don't forget to drink your milk.

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.617
So out in Uncle Billy's land,

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:54.822
I mean, the scientists, the
buildings, what happened?

01:24:54.824 --> 01:24:57.257
It's just all gone.
It's like they were never there.

01:24:58.326 --> 01:25:00.461
They gutted everything.

01:25:00.463 --> 01:25:01.728
We think there must
have been some plan

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.363
in case Uncle Billy
ever disappeared.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:11.238
What about your dad?

01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:16.276
He hasn't turned up.

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:22.349
The last blast completely
fixed me though.

01:25:22.351 --> 01:25:24.418
Doctors said it was
a minor miracle.

01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:29.623
Denny, there's nothing
minor about it.

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:32.726
It was a miracle though.

01:25:32.728 --> 01:25:34.161
Yeah.

01:25:35.763 --> 01:25:37.197
Lisa, I've been thinking.

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:41.602
We've been through a lot
the past few days.

01:25:41.604 --> 01:25:42.769
The past few months.

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:47.433
And I've been trying
to make sense of it all.

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:52.212
I was unfair to you,
when we were together.

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:56.383
I was hurt and I closed off.

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:02.222
But, when I nearly lost you
back there it almost killed me.

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:05.526
I want to be a better man.

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:11.231
I want to be there
for you. Always.

01:26:13.301 --> 01:26:15.335
I want us to be happy together.

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:16.570
Me, too.

01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:19.439
So, why did we break up?

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:27.881
Because I was waiting
for you to figure that out.

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:31.451
And now?

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:39.459
I think you've made a pretty
successful recovery.

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:44.765
Good.

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:48.835
<i>High school's tough.</i>

01:26:48.837 --> 01:26:50.571
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>i was all alone,</i>

01:26:50.573 --> 01:26:53.640
<i>but really I had help</i>
<i>all along.</i>

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:55.242
<i>There was family.</i>

01:26:55.244 --> 01:26:56.810
<i>Your family is what</i>
<i>you make it,</i>

01:26:56.812 --> 01:26:58.645
<i>but with the right people</i>
<i>supporting you,</i>

01:26:58.647 --> 01:27:00.714
<i>you can overcome any obstacle,</i>

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:02.883
<i>defeat any villain.</i>

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:04.751
<i>Yesterday I woke up</i>
<i>and I thought</i>

01:27:04.753 --> 01:27:07.287
<i>i knew everything there</i>
<i>was to know about my life.</i>

01:27:07.289 --> 01:27:09.323
<i>But what I learned is this.</i>

01:27:09.325 --> 01:27:12.693
We're not just regular people,
<i>we're something more.</i>

01:27:12.695 --> 01:27:14.661
Smile.

01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:16.697

Found him
on the Mountain last week.

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:57.978
Third degree burns
over 95% of his body.

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:00.680
We had to restrain him,
kept attacking the orderlies.

01:32:01.749 --> 01:32:04.017
He talk yet?

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:06.286
Just keeps saying one word,
over and over again.

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:08.989
Burke.

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:15.095
Calm down, son.
I know you're angry.

01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:19.966
Them Burke boys
did this to you?

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:26.239
I know them Burke boys,
Mr. Finch, from way back.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:28.808
Nothing but trouble.

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:33.914
<i>Kevin!</i>

01:32:38.753 --> 01:32:43.023
You get yourself all healed up,
then you come see me.

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:48.094
About time I brought
some trouble of my own

01:32:48.096 --> 01:32:49.696
down on them Burke boys.
