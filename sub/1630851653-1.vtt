WEBVTT

00:21.021 --> 00:23.089
[gentle music plays]

00:36.069 --> 00:38.004
[whale] Yeah!

00:38.071 --> 00:39.873
[laughs]

00:49.249 --> 00:51.084
[Atlantean yells]

00:51.184 --> 00:52.419
-Huh? -[Atlanteans yell]

01:03.396 --> 01:05.398
[cackles]

01:05.465 --> 01:07.867
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, presenting to you

01:07.934 --> 01:10.136
the royal court of Atlantis!

01:10.236 --> 01:12.872
Advisor to the king, Vulko!

01:12.939 --> 01:14.307
-[all cheering] -That's my guy.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.042
I am your guy.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.378
[announcer] Princess of Xebel, Mera!

01:18.445 --> 01:19.979
[cheering]

01:20.080 --> 01:21.614
Oh, stop.

01:21.714 --> 01:24.217
[announcer] And first day on the job as King of Atlantis,

01:24.284 --> 01:26.486
-King Aquaman-- -Thank you.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.289
...the outsider from the surface world!

01:29.389 --> 01:31.925
Uh, yeah. Uh, thank you, one and all.

01:31.991 --> 01:34.727
I am really looking forward to being your king.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.097
[Atlantean coughs]

01:37.163 --> 01:39.732
Hmm. Uh, I know I'm new here,

01:39.799 --> 01:43.136
but, uh, I think we're gonna do some great stuff.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.839
[Atlantean coughs]

01:45.939 --> 01:47.941
-Nothing? What? Come on. -Clap for the king.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.008
[grunts]

01:49.109 --> 01:50.310
[whispers] You're doing great, man.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.245
[clears throat] Uh, anyways...

01:52.312 --> 01:55.014
I want you all to know that it's a real honor to take this throne.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.017
And without further ado, I'm gonna take the...

01:58.118 --> 01:59.319
[clears throat]

01:59.419 --> 02:00.420
[grunts]

02:02.489 --> 02:03.990
Huh.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.258
[squeaking]

02:06.326 --> 02:07.527
[groaning]

02:07.627 --> 02:09.195
You can do this.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.131
[Aquaman grunting]

02:13.133 --> 02:14.601
[Aquaman] Got it. Almost got it.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.169
[slurps]

02:18.037 --> 02:19.672
-[thudding] -[gasps]

02:21.207 --> 02:22.842
Well, now that you're properly seated,

02:22.942 --> 02:24.978
it's time for proper king business.

02:25.044 --> 02:27.013
-Neat. -Hey, uh, Vulko?

02:27.113 --> 02:28.648
Is there a different throne we could--

02:28.715 --> 02:30.550
No. Now, as you might imagine,

02:30.650 --> 02:33.019
the kingdom of Atlantis is in a bad state

02:33.119 --> 02:35.155
because of your brother, Ocean Master.

02:35.221 --> 02:38.057
-Ugh! -[groans] Half brother.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.895
Yes, your half brother was king for a long time

02:41.995 --> 02:44.063
and he was doing a terrible job.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.900
Good thing Aquaman defeated that jerk in ritual combat.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.837
Am I right? Yeah, that was pretty great.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.540
It was great, Mera, because now Aquaman is king

02:53.640 --> 02:56.476
and he can get started on my long list

02:56.543 --> 02:59.812
of bureaucratic tasks that Ocean Master was ignoring.

02:59.879 --> 03:03.816
Oh, come on, Vulko. You're gonna start him on the list on the first day?

03:03.883 --> 03:05.218
The list is important, Mera.

03:05.318 --> 03:07.687
Lots of things are important, Vulko.

03:07.754 --> 03:10.857
[sighs] Are you sure we can't get a new throne?

03:10.924 --> 03:14.394
[Ocean Master] That throne won't be yours for much longer!

03:14.494 --> 03:17.830
Because I challenge you to a rematch!

03:17.897 --> 03:19.732
-[crowd gasps] -[announcer] Ocean Master

03:19.832 --> 03:22.235
challenges King Aquaman to royal combat.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.336
Uh, what?

03:23.403 --> 03:25.538
That's right. I'm back.

03:25.605 --> 03:26.773
Wait, you left?

03:26.873 --> 03:29.409
We gave you a room in the guest palace.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.444
It had that great view.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.546
Let's go, Aquaman! Fight me!

03:33.613 --> 03:36.516
Come on, man, didn't we just do this yesterday?

03:36.583 --> 03:39.052
You did. It was literally yesterday.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.721
Yeah, I'm gonna pass. I'm good.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.122
[all gasp]

03:43.223 --> 03:45.458
[announcer] King Aquaman has refused the challenge.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.794
Ocean Master is the new king!

03:47.894 --> 03:49.395
Oh, yeah, I'm back.

03:49.462 --> 03:51.364
Did you miss me? Let me hear it.

03:51.431 --> 03:52.932
-[subjects clamoring] -[Aquaman laughs]

03:53.032 --> 03:54.968
-That's not how it works, right? -That is...

03:55.068 --> 03:56.636
Uh, no, that's almost exactly how it works. Yeah.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.537
[groans]

03:57.604 --> 04:00.039
All hail me! All hail me!

04:00.106 --> 04:01.975
-All hail... [screams] -[thuds]

04:02.075 --> 04:05.044
[announcer] Aquaman has defeated King Ocean Master!

04:05.111 --> 04:06.946
All hail King Aquaman!

04:07.046 --> 04:08.214
[all cheering]

04:08.281 --> 04:10.316
This really shouldn't work this way.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.552
[cheering continues]

04:13.920 --> 04:15.154
[sighs]

04:20.426 --> 04:22.462
[choir singing]

04:25.632 --> 04:26.833
[sighs]

04:26.933 --> 04:29.335
All right, Vulko, tell me about the list.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.803
Huzzah!

04:30.903 --> 04:32.839
There's so many delightful royal tasks to be done.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.507
Oop, watch your feet.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.776
Now, let's see. Oh, yes!

04:36.843 --> 04:38.511
There's a ribbon cutting ceremony

04:38.611 --> 04:40.680
at the new waste treatment center.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.815
-Okay. -Oh, wow!

04:42.915 --> 04:44.350
Picking out fabric for the curtains

04:44.450 --> 04:46.152
at the royal conservatory.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.688
-Ah, sounds important. -It is.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.089
Uh, investigating Outpost Four

04:50.156 --> 04:51.991
because no one's heard from it in seven years.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.027
-Got it. -Stamping tax forms.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.195
-Uh-huh. -Wait, what was that last one?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.530
Ooh, tax forms?

04:57.630 --> 05:00.633
No, the last, last one. Outpost Four!

05:00.700 --> 05:03.303
That's the kind of important thing he should be doing.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.471
-What's Outpost Four? -Which one? The other one?

05:05.538 --> 05:09.375
Oh, oh, that. Oh, yes, it's a remote village established at our border,

05:09.475 --> 05:11.277
but it went silent seven years ago.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.813
Ocean Master said that no one should investigate

05:13.880 --> 05:15.148
because he didn't care.

05:15.214 --> 05:17.350
-Ugh! Ocean Master. -You stink.

05:17.450 --> 05:18.685
You're the worst.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.988
Uh, well, King Aquaman cares.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.623
Right? Right?

05:23.690 --> 05:26.459
Oh, uh, yeah, that's right.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.695
I'll uncover the mystery of Outpost Four

05:28.795 --> 05:30.229
and rescue our poor brethren

05:30.330 --> 05:32.799
who are no doubt in dire need of aid.

05:35.702 --> 05:36.903
All right.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.205
[sighs] What do you people want from me?

05:39.305 --> 05:40.573
Now we're talking.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.576
Let's get out there and save some Atlanteans!

05:43.676 --> 05:45.011
All right, but only if you promise

05:45.078 --> 05:46.846
to do the tax stamping as soon as--

05:46.913 --> 05:48.715
We do not promise that.

05:49.649 --> 05:50.750
Let's ride!

05:50.850 --> 05:53.152
It's really only a few thousand tax for...

05:59.759 --> 06:01.394
[door squeaks, thuds]

06:01.494 --> 06:03.096
-Oh, yeah, all right. -Not bad.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.365
[coughing]

06:09.102 --> 06:12.939
All right, someone get Ocean Master a room with a slightly worse view.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.442
[sighs]

06:16.542 --> 06:17.844
[Aquaman grumbles]

06:17.910 --> 06:20.446
Oh, come on, what's the matter? This is fun.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.518
[sighs] It's nothing. I'm fine.

06:25.585 --> 06:27.186
-You're sulking. -No, I'm not.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.694
Hey, I'm swimming here.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.296
-Hey, careful! -[mumbles]

06:37.397 --> 06:38.297
[sighs]

06:40.933 --> 06:42.568
[Aquaman]  Sorry about that.

06:42.635 --> 06:43.936
Hey, no problem.

06:44.036 --> 06:45.371
[Aquaman sighs]

06:47.640 --> 06:49.575
I'm doing a good job as king, right?

06:49.642 --> 06:51.110
What? Oh, yeah.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.479
I mean, you just started, but, uh,

06:53.579 --> 06:55.248
you're better than Ocean Master, that's for sure.

06:55.314 --> 06:57.483
He was gonna lead us to war with the surface world.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.752
But I can't just not start a war, right?

06:59.819 --> 07:02.321
Like, how do you even know I'm the right person for the job?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.224
I'm only king 'cause I beat up Ocean Master.

07:05.291 --> 07:07.326
Yeah, that was great.

07:13.566 --> 07:16.335
It's a terrible way to pick a king.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.172
Uh... no, it's good.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.908
It's like your surface world sport baseball.

07:21.974 --> 07:25.311
The first one to beat up everyone on the bases with a bat

07:25.411 --> 07:28.414
wins the big ball, huh?

07:28.481 --> 07:31.017
Uh, that's really not how baseball...

07:31.117 --> 07:33.820
[gasps] Oh, no! Uh, uh, mountain!

07:33.920 --> 07:35.188
What now? Oh, oh!

07:37.757 --> 07:39.192
[panting]

07:39.292 --> 07:40.693
Look, you were raised on land,

07:40.793 --> 07:42.929
so you don't understand how things work down here.

07:42.995 --> 07:45.131
The system has been great so far.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.768
I mean, it's been great since you defeated Ocean Master yesterday.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.603
Guess before that, it was pretty terrible.

07:50.670 --> 07:54.207
Sure, but I feel like I have to actually win over my subjects.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.175
This mission will do that.

07:56.275 --> 07:59.812
We'll save everyone at Outpost Four probably by punching someone,

07:59.879 --> 08:01.547
-and you'll show what a great-- -Whale!

08:03.549 --> 08:04.717
[whale moans]

08:04.817 --> 08:06.219
You're gonna apologize to that whale?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.653
Nah, that whale's a jerk.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.522
You do not want to know what she was saying.

08:09.622 --> 08:13.526
Oh, man, your whole "talking to fish" thing is pretty weird.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.829
Weird but cool, just like you.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.197
You're weird and cool, too.

08:19.232 --> 08:22.401
Hey, I'm driving. Inappropriate.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.036
Aw, okay, one more.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.137
[gasps] Whoa!

08:26.172 --> 08:28.374
[water mobile powers down]

08:29.208 --> 08:30.643
[Aquaman] This seems bad.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.079
[both grunting]

08:35.414 --> 08:36.415
[groans]

08:36.515 --> 08:37.884
Uh...

08:37.984 --> 08:40.987
where did the ocean go?

08:44.023 --> 08:45.258
Hmm.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.862
Ha! Oh, man, this is crazy.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.665
It's like some kind of force is holding the water back.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.000
[grunting]

08:54.934 --> 08:57.336
Whoa, this is awesome!

08:57.403 --> 08:59.405
Awesome and deeply suspicious.

08:59.505 --> 09:02.108
Hey, man, are you seeing this? Whoa!

09:02.208 --> 09:03.876
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

09:03.943 --> 09:06.946
The ocean just stops for miles around.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.714
That's got to be bad, right?

09:08.781 --> 09:10.783
Think you could fix it with your, uh...

09:10.883 --> 09:12.184
your water...

09:12.251 --> 09:13.886
Your water thing that you do?

09:13.953 --> 09:15.454
Oh, sure, yeah!

09:15.555 --> 09:17.590
I'll just command the ocean itself

09:17.690 --> 09:21.427
back into place with my hydro-kinetic powers.

09:21.527 --> 09:24.196
Yeah, that thing. Can you... can you do that?

09:24.263 --> 09:26.465
[blows raspberry] Heck, yeah, cowboy!

09:26.566 --> 09:29.101
Watch this!

09:29.201 --> 09:31.437
Whoa! Yeah, keep it going!

09:31.537 --> 09:32.638
Yeah, a little bit further!

09:32.738 --> 09:35.241
I got this!

09:35.308 --> 09:36.375
Whoa!

09:37.743 --> 09:40.046
[groaning]

09:40.112 --> 09:42.148
Mmm, I don't know what's causing this,

09:42.248 --> 09:44.250
but it's dumb, and I don't like it. [grunts]

09:44.317 --> 09:47.486
Well, Outpost Four is just a few miles from here.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.323
Or it was, at least.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.159
I'm gonna guess that the entire ocean being displaced

09:53.259 --> 09:56.329
has something to do with why we haven't heard from them in seven years.

09:56.429 --> 10:00.666
Eh, I don't know, maybe they're just not the chatty types.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.603
[clears throat] The displacement thing sounds good, too.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.472
Let's go. We'll have to walk from here.

10:06.572 --> 10:09.308
Yeah. Hey, Mera, wait up!

10:12.278 --> 10:14.747
[Aquaman groans] How long have we been walking?

10:14.814 --> 10:17.683
Come on, man, I thought you liked the land stuff.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.318
[panting] I do!

10:20.686 --> 10:22.989
[blows sand] I guess I'm just a little thirsty.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.190
Can you hand me that water bottle?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.626
The... the water bottle?

10:26.692 --> 10:28.961
Yeah, the water bottle that you have?

10:29.028 --> 10:30.830
You know, for drinking? [mimics glugging]

10:30.930 --> 10:33.165
I, uh, have an air jar?

10:33.265 --> 10:34.533
Why would you need an air jar?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.302
We're surrounded by air!

10:36.369 --> 10:38.137
Well, normally, we're surrounded by water,

10:38.204 --> 10:40.272
which would make a water jar ridiculous.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.308
Well, there isn't any water here now!

10:42.375 --> 10:44.877
You don't know! There might be!

10:44.977 --> 10:46.679
[grunting]

10:48.948 --> 10:50.983
Eh. There isn't.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.485
I'm not used to this!

10:52.551 --> 10:54.787
You're the land-guy, why didn't you bring water?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.492
Whoa, maybe you should play baseball.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.894
Why, do they throw stuff in baseball?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.629
Uh. I don't know. Probably not.

11:03.696 --> 11:05.698
Anyways, it's not a big deal. I just saw the water bottle--

11:05.798 --> 11:08.534
[grunts angrily] It's an air jar!

11:08.634 --> 11:09.735
You don't have to yell!

11:09.835 --> 11:11.137
I'm not yelling!

11:11.203 --> 11:13.539
It's just very hot here and I don't like it!

11:13.639 --> 11:15.141
[groans]

11:15.207 --> 11:16.409
[sighs] Well, it sounds

11:16.509 --> 11:18.577
like someone needs a fishy-back ride.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.012
Whoo-hoo!

11:24.050 --> 11:26.652
[weakly] I'm so thirsty.

11:26.719 --> 11:29.388
[Aquaman groans]

11:29.488 --> 11:32.324
Well, it's worse for the villagers of Outpost Four.

11:32.391 --> 11:35.528
They're the "fishier" kind of fish-people.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.096
They can't breathe air at all.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.331
Oh, boy. I really don't want to go back to Atlantis

11:39.398 --> 11:41.600
and be like, [haughtily] "They all dried up."

11:41.701 --> 11:43.602
Maybe they're okay. Somehow.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.271
Well, we have to find them and figure out

11:45.371 --> 11:47.239
-what happened to-- [grunts] -Look. Water!

11:48.240 --> 11:49.375
[both] Whoa!

11:50.543 --> 11:51.877
Whoo! Ha-ha!

11:51.944 --> 11:54.380
[laughing excitedly]

11:59.752 --> 12:01.520
[sighs in relief]

12:01.587 --> 12:03.923
Ah, yeah. That's way better!

12:04.023 --> 12:06.625
Yeah. This is great. And if there's water here,

12:06.726 --> 12:08.728
maybe there's people around, too.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.699
Yeah. Maybe there are people around.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.535
People intruding on our water!

12:16.602 --> 12:17.703
Your water?

12:17.770 --> 12:19.805
This is our oasis, you got that?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.273
So, you better skedaddle.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.709
But, like, give us all your stuff first.

12:23.776 --> 12:25.911
Because also, we're robbing you!

12:25.978 --> 12:28.814
Robbing us? I'd like to see you try!

12:28.914 --> 12:30.316
We're gonna take your stuff!

12:30.416 --> 12:31.450
[grunting]

12:35.254 --> 12:37.123
-[yelling] -[screaming]

12:39.291 --> 12:41.660
-Whoa! Whoa there! -Huh?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.597
Let's just all calm down.

12:44.663 --> 12:47.566
-[grunts] I'm Aquaman, and-- -[Mera] To heck with that!

12:47.633 --> 12:49.168
If these dopes wanna fight...

12:49.268 --> 12:51.804
-[all gasp] -Hey, who you calling dopes?

12:51.904 --> 12:53.339
Here we go.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.774
Then I say...

12:57.276 --> 12:59.512
bases loaded, baby.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.514
Again, not what baseball is.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.852
And that definitely isn't what baseball is.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.088
-[groans] Ow! Stop that! -[yelling]

13:11.123 --> 13:12.258
Foul ball!

13:12.324 --> 13:14.460
See? It's fighting time!

13:14.527 --> 13:15.795
All right. [grunting]

13:20.132 --> 13:22.268
-Huh? -[laughs, grunts]

13:23.002 --> 13:23.803
[grunts]

13:23.869 --> 13:25.838
[pants, grunts]

13:25.938 --> 13:27.973
-[laughs] -[grunting]

13:29.975 --> 13:31.343
[all grunting]

13:46.192 --> 13:48.394
Get out of our oasis!

13:50.062 --> 13:50.896
Never!

13:53.699 --> 13:58.070
[groans] Okay. Time to get serious.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.406
[both laugh]

14:01.841 --> 14:02.875
[whimpering]

14:04.410 --> 14:05.344
Huh?

14:11.584 --> 14:12.585
[grunts]

14:13.919 --> 14:15.688
Hang on, buddy, I'mma coming.

14:18.891 --> 14:19.825
Let go!

14:19.892 --> 14:20.926
[grunting]

14:23.229 --> 14:26.332
[laughs] You guys don't stand a chance!

14:26.866 --> 14:27.867
[grunts]

14:28.767 --> 14:29.869
[pinging]

14:33.706 --> 14:35.908
Uh, what's happening?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.844
-[screaming] -[yelling]

14:42.281 --> 14:43.849
[groans]

14:43.916 --> 14:46.785
Did you just talk to that fish?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.787
I don't know. Let's ask it.

14:49.622 --> 14:50.689
Huh?

14:50.756 --> 14:53.192
[whimpers, screams]

14:54.860 --> 14:55.961
[Mera laughs]

14:58.530 --> 15:00.366
Oh, my bats!

15:05.871 --> 15:10.109
Oh no! Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [screams]

15:10.209 --> 15:11.944
[all groaning]

15:13.979 --> 15:15.247
[Aquaman and Mera] All right!

15:16.081 --> 15:17.383
[groaning]

15:17.449 --> 15:19.885
Uncle! Uncle! We give up!

15:19.952 --> 15:23.122
And that is how you play baseball.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.490
It... it isn't.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.325
Please, no more!

15:26.425 --> 15:29.228
We are no match for this horror you call baseball!

15:29.295 --> 15:30.896
Just let us back in the water.

15:30.963 --> 15:34.300
You can stay here, too. Honest!

15:34.400 --> 15:36.936
Who are you? Are you the people of Outpost Four?

15:37.002 --> 15:38.304
[all laugh]

15:38.404 --> 15:42.007
As if. We used to rob those rubes. Check it.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.410
Rob 'em blind we did. [laughs]

15:44.476 --> 15:46.445
-You're not helping your case! -[whimpers]

15:46.512 --> 15:47.846
Please, hear us out.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.949
Yes, we are bandits. [gasps]

15:50.015 --> 15:52.918
And things were good in the "before times,"

15:52.985 --> 15:57.323
but that all changed when the water went away.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.024
-Water! -[hyperventilating]

15:59.124 --> 16:00.693
No, no, no!

16:00.793 --> 16:04.029
-What happened? -Well, I'll tell ya.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.533
We were just minding our own business...

16:07.633 --> 16:10.869
raiding Outpost Four, and stealing all their stuff,

16:10.970 --> 16:13.172
-when there came a great rumbling! -[all] Huh?

16:13.272 --> 16:17.476
Then, before we knew it, the seas themselves parted!

16:17.543 --> 16:21.347
Oh, it was terrible! I had just stolen a great TV.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.549
With the water gone, the land turned

16:23.649 --> 16:26.885
into this harsh desert you see before you.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.887
Dry sand is the worst!

16:28.988 --> 16:32.624
Ever since then we've been hiding out in this oasis,

16:32.691 --> 16:34.827
working on these breathing devices

16:34.893 --> 16:37.229
so we might escape the desert one day.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.564
You're not even wearing one.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.533
-I breathe through my armpits. -Ugh!

16:41.633 --> 16:44.403
We barely remember our lives in the before times.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.238
How long ago did the waters part?

16:46.338 --> 16:48.040
-I don't know, about a week. -A week?

16:48.140 --> 16:50.676
It's been a long week.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.711
Okay. Where is the Outpost from here?

16:52.811 --> 16:55.714
We haven't left the oasis since the water went away.

16:55.814 --> 16:58.050
But the outpost is right over that dune.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.921
Um, okay. Thanks for, uh...

17:03.022 --> 17:03.989
[all gasping]

17:04.056 --> 17:05.491
I don't know, nothing, I guess.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.092
-[all groaning] -Let's go.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.427
[Mera grunting]

17:08.527 --> 17:10.696
[laughs] We showed them!

17:10.763 --> 17:12.097
-[grunts] -[all yelp]

17:12.197 --> 17:13.899
That's what I thought!

17:19.872 --> 17:22.040
That does not look like an outpost.

17:22.107 --> 17:23.509
What the heck is it?

17:24.710 --> 17:26.578
Uh, it looks like...

17:27.579 --> 17:30.516
I don't know, a giant drill?

17:30.582 --> 17:33.619
Looks like there's a bunch of buildings on top. Crazy!

17:33.719 --> 17:37.056
Maybe we wait till dark and sneak up to the drill without being spotted.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.791
Then we can figure out what it's doing here and--

17:38.891 --> 17:42.795
-Man... man on a car thing. -Hmm.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.898
[Russian accent] Hello! Welcome to drill.

17:47.466 --> 17:51.103
Yes. Hi, I am Pytor Mortikov! Pleasure.

17:51.203 --> 17:54.640
-[exhales] -And I'm gonna punch this guy.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.209
Just hold on a sec.

17:57.276 --> 18:00.546
Hi there! I'm Aquaman, and this is Mera.

18:00.612 --> 18:01.480
[grunts]

18:01.580 --> 18:03.282
Uh... [chuckles nervously]

18:03.382 --> 18:05.150
I'm, um, King of Atlantis,

18:05.250 --> 18:07.086
but you probably don't know that 'cause I'm brand new

18:07.152 --> 18:08.654
and you're from the surface world.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.755
[chuckles]

18:09.822 --> 18:11.890
Surface world?

18:11.957 --> 18:13.826
Ah, I understand.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.894
You undersea people.

18:15.961 --> 18:17.429
Yes.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.631
We're looking for an outpost that's supposed to be here.

18:19.731 --> 18:23.302
Hmm. No outpost. No water, too.

18:23.402 --> 18:26.004
Very lucky for drill, eh? Please.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.308
You must have tour.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.509
[laughs] Cool!

18:30.609 --> 18:32.344
-[grunts] -My gut says we fight him.

18:32.444 --> 18:36.615
[sighs] Mera, let's just try talking first this time?

18:36.682 --> 18:39.251
Besides, this guy is so polite.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.353
[chuckling]

18:41.453 --> 18:44.623
Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.529
The water was gone when I find it, yes.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.799
Only sand, dirt and rare metals.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.367
How convenient for you.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.871
Very true. Deep sea drilling is major hassle.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.973
Much easier without sea.

19:01.039 --> 19:03.709
Whoa! This drill is really something.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.711
Thank you.

19:05.811 --> 19:09.348
I invent myself, just like Grappler.

19:09.448 --> 19:10.516
Mmm, mmm.

19:10.616 --> 19:12.885
You beautiful, handsome Grappler.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.355
[robot hands] Help, help, help?

19:16.455 --> 19:17.990
Wow, this is pretty great.

19:18.056 --> 19:19.324
But where's your team?

19:19.391 --> 19:22.728
No team. Only me and my robot hand helpers.

19:22.828 --> 19:26.498
But I am not lonely, I am normal. [chuckles]

19:26.565 --> 19:27.566
Ah...

19:27.666 --> 19:29.568
Sorry, I mean, I am fine.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.837
English not my first language,  da?

19:31.904 --> 19:33.138
He can talk to fish.

19:33.205 --> 19:36.375
Ooh, that is weird and cool.

19:36.475 --> 19:40.345
And I live up here. That is basically tour. Now, dinner!

19:40.412 --> 19:43.749
[Aquaman eating] Mmm.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.750
So good.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.186
[robot hand] Help, help, help?

19:47.252 --> 19:50.856
[robot hands] Help, help, help?

19:50.923 --> 19:52.691
[Aquaman chuckles] Don't mind if I do.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.901
Mmm, this is good. So stinking good.

20:06.405 --> 20:09.508
[robot hand] Help, help, help?

20:09.575 --> 20:11.610
[Aquaman chomping]

20:14.246 --> 20:15.113
Hmm?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.617
Perfect. [chuckles]

20:18.717 --> 20:20.953
Dude, stop eating when he's looking at us all creepy.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.055
But... but I love it.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.023
[Mortikov] Ah! I'm so glad you enjoy.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.359
I was worried maybe you didn't eat fish

20:27.426 --> 20:28.694
because of talking to them.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.963
Then why'd you serve it to us, then?

20:31.063 --> 20:32.631
Hmm, your point.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.933
[chuckles nervously] She is good.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.401
-[Mera growls] -We all eat fish.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.437
We live under the sea, so it's kinda all we got.

20:38.537 --> 20:39.638
But they can't grill 'em.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.240
Everything is boiled underwater.

20:41.306 --> 20:44.309
You don't think about that until you live there.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.812
And then it's all you think about.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.413
-[robot hands] Help, help, help? -[Aquaman] Oh.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.316
I hear stories about the Aquaman.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.585
You were born on land, yes?

20:53.652 --> 20:56.989
Something about a father, a lighthouse.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.991
[burps] Huh? What? Uh, yeah.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.493
Yeah, I grew up in a lighthouse with just my dad, or whatever.

21:01.593 --> 21:02.828
Kinda stunk without my mom.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.429
But, you know, lighthouses. It was fine.

21:04.496 --> 21:09.968
Ah. I, too, grew up in a... special situation.

21:10.068 --> 21:11.603
I was not always

21:11.670 --> 21:14.906
the giant mecha-drill-wielding salvage baron you see today.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.743
Dredging the ocean, looking for scrap

21:17.809 --> 21:20.078
and things people left behind,

21:20.145 --> 21:21.647
happening upon this site,

21:21.747 --> 21:23.515
and using my salvaging equipment

21:23.615 --> 21:27.019
to dig for rare gems in the earth's surface.

21:27.119 --> 21:31.790
No. I was once a boy growing up in the garbage dump,

21:31.857 --> 21:34.493
being raised only by my dear mother.

21:34.593 --> 21:37.362
The only thing she loved more than old tires

21:37.462 --> 21:39.931
and roasted scrap metal was me,

21:39.998 --> 21:42.868
her little garbage prince. [chuckles]

21:42.968 --> 21:44.369
She raised me well.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.138
And look where I am today.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.273
A king of sorts.

21:48.340 --> 21:50.709
Just as I'm sure your dad raised you

21:50.809 --> 21:53.145
to be a fantastic king, huh?

21:53.211 --> 21:55.147
Ah, thanks, man. When you say it like that,

21:55.213 --> 21:56.782
we do kinda sound alike.

21:56.848 --> 22:00.218
Yes! I'm sure the smell of hot wet garbage brings about

22:00.319 --> 22:01.720
the same nostalgic memories

22:01.820 --> 22:04.890
of mom's spoiled milk and rotting food casseroles

22:04.990 --> 22:06.725
-as it does for me. -What, uh...

22:06.825 --> 22:09.561
Okay, that's it! Quit trying to butter up my boyfriend

22:09.661 --> 22:12.064
by talking about your very relatable childhoods.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.965
Well, I don't know about that last--

22:14.032 --> 22:16.968
Where is Outpost four, and all the fish-people who lived there?

22:17.035 --> 22:21.740
[sighs] I tell you, I have seen no outpost.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.911
[grunts angrily] Then this is the wrong place!

22:26.011 --> 22:29.247
Ugh, this is what we get for listening to the dang bandits.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.216
You might be sad, and apt to flip

22:31.316 --> 22:33.251
more of my possessions upon hearing this,

22:33.352 --> 22:36.588
but your outpost is nowhere.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.223
What? It has to be somewhere.

22:38.323 --> 22:39.391
One would think,

22:39.491 --> 22:41.259
but from my central command center,

22:41.360 --> 22:43.328
entire desert can be seen.

22:43.395 --> 22:45.997
And I promise you, no outpost.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.766
Can we check out the view from up there?

22:47.866 --> 22:48.867
We have to be sure.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.769
Of course. In morning.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.371
Come on, we're in a big hurry.

22:52.437 --> 22:55.507
You must stay the night. I have never had guest.

22:55.574 --> 22:59.578
My luxurious guest room, it goes unoccupied.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.780
Please.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.682
[Aquaman] I gotta hand it to him.

23:03.749 --> 23:06.618
[straining] This is very luxurious.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.020
-[straining and moaning] -Ugh.

23:09.087 --> 23:10.522
I don't know how you can relax in this place.

23:10.589 --> 23:14.059
I don't know, this is really comfortable.

23:14.626 --> 23:15.527
[sighs]

23:15.594 --> 23:17.062
[Mera grunts angrily]

23:17.129 --> 23:20.065
Sorry. It's just really nice to sit in a real chair.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.767
Hey! You think this could be my throne?

23:21.867 --> 23:23.568
Like, we just take it back with us?

23:23.635 --> 23:24.770
It's a really nice chair.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.304
[irritated] It is nice!

23:26.405 --> 23:29.307
But that's making me madder somehow. [grunts]

23:29.408 --> 23:30.976
That guy is up to something.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.478
Eh, he's a little off-putting, but maybe he's just weird?

23:33.578 --> 23:35.046
He said he's never had a guest before.

23:35.113 --> 23:36.615
We tried talking to him.

23:36.715 --> 23:40.051
Now I think it's time for Plan A, punching.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.087
You mean Plan B?

23:42.154 --> 23:45.090
Nope. It was always Plan A. You just skipped it.

23:45.157 --> 23:48.794
[sighs] We can't punch out random deep-sea miners

23:48.894 --> 23:52.998
just because everything they say and do is deeply suspicious.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.000
Um, it seems like we can, though.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.836
Well, what we can do is check out the command center.

23:57.936 --> 24:01.173
Just remember, we gotta be really sneaky.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.075
My new throne! Aw, man.

24:04.142 --> 24:05.510
[Mera] Sorry. No other choice.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.179
[grunting] Uh, wait up.

24:08.313 --> 24:09.314
Alley-oop!

24:13.151 --> 24:14.486
[Mera] Oh, whoops.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.955
[robot hand 1 beeping] We're a team of evil.

24:17.022 --> 24:18.490
[Aquaman] Looks like the coast is clear.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.358
[both grunting]

24:28.266 --> 24:29.034
Huh?

24:29.134 --> 24:31.636
[robot hand burbling]

24:34.639 --> 24:36.875
[indistinct robot hand conversation]

24:36.975 --> 24:39.377
[whispering] Hmm. We gotta get into that tower.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.379
Any ideas?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.515
Yeah. I'll use my water powers to lasso them and then you then tackle 'em!

24:43.615 --> 24:45.317
Yeah, but you don't have any water.

24:45.383 --> 24:46.785
Yeah, don't worry about it.

24:46.852 --> 24:48.119
-I just need a little. -No, no.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.464
This is probably a trash can, right?

24:59.531 --> 25:00.665
Eh, I assume.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.401
Good enough for me.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.303
You know, I think we're pretty good at being sneaky,

25:05.370 --> 25:07.138
but that was kinda easy, wasn't it?

25:07.205 --> 25:10.075
Whatever. Let's just see what he's hiding in this command center.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.544
-[Mortikov] Hello. -[both gasp]

25:12.644 --> 25:16.548
-Huh? Mortikov, we just wanted to look for... -[clanging]

25:16.648 --> 25:21.253
So glad to find you. Please, follow me.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.424
Yeah,  da. It is not much further.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.593
My most sincerest apologies.

25:28.693 --> 25:32.330
After dinner it occurred to me that I have not been helpful.

25:32.397 --> 25:35.600
I realize I do know where Outpost may be.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.269
Eh, I have clue, at least.

25:37.369 --> 25:41.706
I look for you in guest room to give news, but it is empty.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.342
We were just, uh, stretching our legs.

25:44.409 --> 25:48.613
Exercise is good. Legs, also good.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.348
Uh, right.

25:50.415 --> 25:51.850
Ah! We are here.

25:51.917 --> 25:54.920
When I begin mining, mysterious hole appears

25:55.020 --> 25:57.789
in sifting pile. I have no reason for this.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.226
Perhaps connected to your missing outpost?

26:01.293 --> 26:04.696
Hmm. We'll check it out. See? You were helpful.

26:04.763 --> 26:07.265
I am glad.

26:07.365 --> 26:09.067
Looks like the diplomatic approach got us

26:09.134 --> 26:11.102
-a clue. -Ugh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:11.202 --> 26:13.305
Do we, uh, jump down there?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.140
I don't know. I think we need caving gear?

26:15.240 --> 26:17.809
Mortikov probably has some. Or he could make us some.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.377
He's been really helpful, so I'm sure...

26:19.444 --> 26:21.212
[gears cranking]

26:21.279 --> 26:22.414
Oh, no.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.416
-[Mera yelps] -Apologies, Aquaman.

26:24.482 --> 26:28.053
You have done a great mistake trusting me!

26:28.119 --> 26:30.622
-[Aquaman and Mera screaming] -Enjoy pit.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.058
I told you!

26:33.124 --> 26:35.794
But he was being so polite!

26:35.894 --> 26:36.995
As a trick!

26:37.095 --> 26:39.164
How was I supposed to know that?

26:39.965 --> 26:40.899
[Mera] Oh.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.501
At least there's water down here.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.671
Yeah. I mean, maybe this won't be so bad after all.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.107
-[growling] -What is going on?

26:49.174 --> 26:53.345
[moaning]

26:53.445 --> 26:58.583
Uh, whoever you are, you should know that I'm, uh, Aquaman. King of Atlantis!

26:58.650 --> 26:59.517
[whimpers]

27:01.286 --> 27:02.287
[gasping]

27:06.524 --> 27:10.028
So, we got a new king, huh? Big whoop.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.031
Are you the townspeople of Outpost Four?

27:13.131 --> 27:15.000
Yeah, what's left of it.

27:15.100 --> 27:20.605
I'm Gillian. I was the mayor back when there was something to be mayor of.

27:20.672 --> 27:21.873
-[Mera] Ooh! -Oh!

27:21.973 --> 27:23.208
It's Outpost Four!

27:23.308 --> 27:25.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Outpost Four.

27:25.176 --> 27:27.479
Anyway, that's Merdussa.

27:27.545 --> 27:28.546
Hello!

27:28.647 --> 27:30.548
-Finhead. -Sup?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.317
-Toby. -Hey!

27:32.384 --> 27:34.386
-And the rest. -[barks]

27:34.486 --> 27:35.620
What happened here?

27:35.687 --> 27:37.989
Well, let's see. Everything was fine,

27:38.056 --> 27:42.360
and then Pytor Mortikov buries our town in sand!

27:42.460 --> 27:44.062
We don't know how he parted the waters,

27:44.162 --> 27:45.864
but he must have! [whimpers]

27:45.964 --> 27:48.533
Yeah. He showed up right after it happened.

27:48.633 --> 27:50.702
Hmmm. And when was that?

27:50.802 --> 27:54.706
A week ago? The longest week of my life. [scoffs]

27:54.806 --> 27:57.709
Atlantis hasn't heard from you in seven years.

27:57.809 --> 28:00.679
Yeah. It feels like seven years. [scoffs]

28:00.745 --> 28:03.515
All I know is we can't breathe without water,

28:03.581 --> 28:06.051
so Mortikov threw us down in this pit

28:06.151 --> 28:08.420
and started mining our town into the earth.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.821
Ooh, that jerk!

28:09.888 --> 28:11.856
I should have hit him right in his big head

28:11.923 --> 28:13.525
with a water baseball bat.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.994
Oh! A baseball fan?

28:16.061 --> 28:18.530
Nice to meet a fellow lover of land sports.

28:18.596 --> 28:22.767
It's still not really baseball, but it would be nice to take a bat to Mortikov.

28:22.867 --> 28:26.337
Well, we can't get out of here, because even if we could escape,

28:26.404 --> 28:28.106
we wouldn't be able to breathe.

28:28.206 --> 28:31.943
He's a king, though. He's probably got a plan. [giggles]

28:32.043 --> 28:34.446
[scoffs] Don't count on it.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.082
All kings do is let you down.

28:37.882 --> 28:38.917
Huh? Hmm?

28:40.218 --> 28:41.853
Well, this stinks.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.622
How am I supposed to save everyone stuck down here?

28:44.723 --> 28:45.790
[grumbles]

28:45.890 --> 28:46.958
You're like, a superhero, right?

28:47.058 --> 28:48.359
You can fly us out.

28:48.426 --> 28:50.962
With what? The little wings on my ankles?

28:51.062 --> 28:56.134
[sighs] It's fine. I'm really strong, I can probably dig out of here.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.403
So, I guess that's my plan.

28:58.470 --> 29:02.207
I'll just dig us a 30-mile tunnel back to the ocean! [grunts angrily]

29:02.273 --> 29:03.541
This is going great!

29:03.608 --> 29:04.976
-[rumbling] -Uh-oh.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.611
[whirring]

29:08.413 --> 29:09.647
Yeah!

29:09.748 --> 29:10.715
[laughing]

29:11.549 --> 29:12.484
You guys!

29:12.584 --> 29:14.319
Well, well, well.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.322
We were looking for the source of our oasis, and what do we find?

29:17.422 --> 29:18.590
It's those villagers!

29:18.656 --> 29:20.625
-Let's rob 'em. -Huh?

29:20.725 --> 29:23.261
Hey, it's those bandits that always robbed us!

29:23.328 --> 29:26.664
Let's beat 'em up! And I guess, arrest them.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.300
[all yelling]

29:29.400 --> 29:30.635
-Huh? -Oh, yeah!

29:30.735 --> 29:33.605
Looks like it's finally fighting time.

29:33.671 --> 29:36.107
Wait!

29:40.445 --> 29:41.746
What are you doing?

29:41.813 --> 29:44.582
Listen, every problem has a different solution.

29:44.649 --> 29:47.786
And sometimes, the right thing to do is talk.

29:47.852 --> 29:49.287
[Mera blows raspberry]

29:49.354 --> 29:52.023
And other times the right thing to do is fight.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.792
-Nice. -But right now,

29:53.858 --> 29:56.828
everyone in this cave needs to talk...

29:56.928 --> 29:58.463
Uh, this better be going somewhere.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.532
...about teaming up to fight Mortikov.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.866
[blows raspberry, yells]

30:02.801 --> 30:04.602
Okay, you got my attention.

30:04.669 --> 30:06.371
Your two groups have had their differences.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.040
Differences? They robbed us. Like, every day.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.609
Yeah. It's not an equal thing here, I get that.

30:11.676 --> 30:13.878
But Mortikov has messed up all of your lives.

30:13.978 --> 30:18.483
It's true. It was much easier to rob people when there was water.

30:18.550 --> 30:19.951
You're not helping.

30:20.018 --> 30:22.053
But together, you have all the tools you need.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.856
The bandits have a drill and breathing machines, so you can leave this cave.

30:24.956 --> 30:28.493
And the Outpost people have the numbers we'll need to overwhelm Mortikov.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.796
And I've got baseball bats. Enough for everyone.

30:31.863 --> 30:33.565
-[all gasping] -[excited laughter]

30:33.665 --> 30:36.568
Yeah, that's great. See? Everyone's contributing.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.369
All right. What do you guys got?

30:38.469 --> 30:40.905
We've got dang super powers, baby!

30:41.005 --> 30:43.408
Hey, that's true. They beat us up pretty good.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.410
Check it out, I got a picture.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.911
Oop, hold on, that's not it.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.546
Oh, there we go. See what I mean?

30:48.646 --> 30:50.682
[both straining]

30:51.349 --> 30:52.350
[metal clanking]

30:53.685 --> 30:54.586
[metal clanking]

30:55.887 --> 30:57.088
[grunting]

30:57.188 --> 30:58.590
Yeah, all right. I'm starting to like this.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.158
So what do you say? Wanna team up

31:00.225 --> 31:02.427
and beat the living tar out of Pytor Mortikov?

31:02.527 --> 31:04.362
[excited and affirmative chatter]

31:04.429 --> 31:06.431
Actually, we don't know who that is.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.233
We'll explain it to you.

31:14.439 --> 31:16.441
[Mortikov] Big pile.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.243
Many dirt.

31:18.343 --> 31:20.612
Dry as bones.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.349
Very good. [yawns]

31:24.415 --> 31:28.887
Ah. Perhaps tonight I will sleep in guest room as a reward.

31:28.953 --> 31:32.190
So much more luxurious than my room.

31:33.057 --> 31:33.925
[gasps]

31:34.025 --> 31:35.693
Why did I build this way?

31:36.561 --> 31:37.428
[yelps]

31:42.467 --> 31:43.801
[both grunt]

31:48.573 --> 31:49.540
[yells]

31:50.909 --> 31:51.976
[Mortikov grunts]

31:55.647 --> 31:56.748
Hey, Mortikov.

31:57.949 --> 31:59.083
We're back!

32:00.218 --> 32:04.122
Hmm. Yes, you have all teamed up.

32:04.222 --> 32:05.990
How nice for you.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.091
[all laugh]

32:07.158 --> 32:07.992
Goodbye.

32:11.129 --> 32:13.731
[growls] After him!

32:14.432 --> 32:15.266
[grunts]

32:17.001 --> 32:18.136
Huh? [grunts]

32:19.437 --> 32:21.239
-[grunts] -[gear] Ping!

32:23.274 --> 32:24.342
[Aquaman and Mera] Huh?

32:26.945 --> 32:28.179
-Huh? -[bandit grunting]

32:35.620 --> 32:36.654
Get away!

32:38.456 --> 32:39.991
Watch out!

32:40.091 --> 32:42.193
He knows Tank-fu!

32:46.197 --> 32:47.298
Alley-oop.

32:49.767 --> 32:52.470
Ugh. Disgusting fish person!

32:52.537 --> 32:53.504
Ugh!

32:53.604 --> 32:55.506
This is for burying my town!

32:57.342 --> 33:00.144
Town was gross! Like you.

33:00.211 --> 33:01.546
Huh? Ugh!

33:01.646 --> 33:02.647
[hissing]

33:03.982 --> 33:05.216
Stop hitting!

33:07.785 --> 33:09.120
[Merdussa] Oh, my eels!

33:09.187 --> 33:10.455
[grunting]

33:12.056 --> 33:14.459
[all yelling]

33:16.060 --> 33:16.995
Huh?

33:18.563 --> 33:19.397
[grunts]

33:23.835 --> 33:25.136
[grunting]

33:26.070 --> 33:26.904
[clanks]

[groans]

33:32.010 --> 33:33.144
[bandits grunt]

33:34.145 --> 33:35.246
Are we done here?

33:35.346 --> 33:37.248
Heh. Looks like we're done to me.

33:37.348 --> 33:41.819
I would not recommend underestimating me.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.089
[robot hands] Help, help, help?

33:45.189 --> 33:47.692
-Um, what's happening? -The heck should I know?

33:47.759 --> 33:51.029
[laughs evilly] Get me to central command.

33:58.936 --> 34:00.204
[laughing evilly]

34:01.539 --> 34:05.343
And grill the fish. [continues laughing]

34:05.410 --> 34:07.612
[robot hands] Help, help, help?

34:07.712 --> 34:09.113
[robot hands] Destroy.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.416
He's getting away! We gotta do something.

34:11.516 --> 34:14.085
You're right. You know what that means.

34:14.185 --> 34:15.553
Bases loaded, baby.

34:15.620 --> 34:16.454
[gasps]

34:17.722 --> 34:19.123
Batter up.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.059
[Aquaman and Mera yell]

34:21.125 --> 34:22.126
[robots burbling]

34:22.727 --> 34:23.795
[all] Huh?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.129
-[Aquaman grunts] -[Mera laughing]

34:36.307 --> 34:37.208
[Aquaman gasps]

34:43.881 --> 34:45.149
Whoa!

34:45.249 --> 34:46.083
[grunting]

34:55.993 --> 34:56.828
[laughs]

35:02.667 --> 35:04.302
-[robot hands burbling] -[bandit yelling]

35:05.903 --> 35:07.738
[mimics robots, laughs] Whoa!

35:10.741 --> 35:13.511
[yelling]

35:19.016 --> 35:19.851
Huh?

35:19.951 --> 35:20.785
[burbling]

35:23.988 --> 35:24.956
-Uh-oh. -Huh?

35:25.022 --> 35:26.591
-[burbling] -[yelling]

35:33.831 --> 35:35.700
[Mera] Hmm.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.635
Y'all think I'm out of weapons, huh?

35:37.702 --> 35:41.272
Well, this time I filled my air jar with water!

35:41.339 --> 35:42.773
[grunts]

35:42.840 --> 35:46.544
Let's go around the horn!

35:46.644 --> 35:48.613
[laughs] Hey, Toby! Heads up.

35:48.679 --> 35:49.847
Huh? Oh.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.284
I love baseball!

35:54.152 --> 35:55.119
[Aquaman grunting]

36:13.070 --> 36:15.239
-[robot hands burbling] -Mortikov!

36:15.339 --> 36:17.975
[Mortikov laughing evilly]

36:18.042 --> 36:19.477
-[grunts] -Man!

36:19.544 --> 36:21.379
We'll never catch up to him now.

36:21.479 --> 36:22.580
-Huh? -[robot hand burbling]

36:22.680 --> 36:24.482
[Toby grunts]

36:24.549 --> 36:27.084
We'll never catch up to him on feet.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.686
[laughs]

36:28.753 --> 36:29.820
[straining]

36:37.862 --> 36:39.163
Atlanteans!

36:39.230 --> 36:41.232
[all] Huh?

36:41.332 --> 36:45.336
Mortikov wants to get to his command center, so we gotta stop him!

36:45.403 --> 36:47.104
Clear a path.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.608
-[chuckles] You heard the King! Clear a path! -[all yelling]

36:51.876 --> 36:52.710
Yeah!

37:01.619 --> 37:02.453
Huh?

37:03.955 --> 37:05.356
Go, go, go!

37:10.628 --> 37:13.130
Hey, Morty, what's in that command center, anyway?

37:13.231 --> 37:16.400
Never mind, I'll check it out myself! [laughing]

37:16.467 --> 37:17.969
No! You must not!

37:23.874 --> 37:25.042
Huh? [grunts]

37:39.924 --> 37:43.961
How dare you use machines I invent to thwart me?

37:45.162 --> 37:46.964
If I beat you with your machine,

37:47.064 --> 37:49.500
it's kinda like win-win for you, right? [laughs]

37:49.600 --> 37:51.402
No! Is not how it works.

37:52.603 --> 37:53.604
Huh?

37:53.671 --> 37:55.172
[grunts, groans]

37:57.275 --> 37:58.976
All right. We'll call it a draw.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.347
Fat chance, Aquaman.

38:03.447 --> 38:06.183
Activate full command defenses. Now!

38:09.153 --> 38:10.655
-[beams whirring] -Huh?

38:10.755 --> 38:11.522
[grunts]

38:11.622 --> 38:13.357
[laughs] Too easy.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.460
-Huh? -[beams powering up]

38:16.527 --> 38:18.462
-[alarm blaring] -Huh?

38:18.529 --> 38:20.698
Overheating? Not possible!

38:20.798 --> 38:23.367
Vent! Why will it not vent?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.803
[burbling]

38:25.870 --> 38:28.839
I guess that wasn't a trash can. Huh. [grunting]

38:32.943 --> 38:35.346
All right. What do you got hiding in here? Whoa!

38:38.015 --> 38:39.050
What is that?

38:41.185 --> 38:44.155
Is that crystal powering this whole drill?

38:44.221 --> 38:48.392
And is this battery powering the crystal? This is crazy.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.560
-[metal clanking] -[gasps]

38:51.062 --> 38:52.463
[laughing in distance]

38:52.530 --> 38:55.566
[Mortikov] You have gotten too far, little Aquaman,

38:55.666 --> 38:58.302
son of the lighthouse keeper.

38:58.369 --> 39:00.571
But this is the last beacon

39:00.671 --> 39:03.474
you are ever going to be seeing.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.876
It doesn't have to end like this, Mortikov.

39:05.976 --> 39:10.014
Oh, but I think it does, for you.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.315
[gasps, grunts]

39:11.382 --> 39:12.717
-[Mortikov laughing] -[grunts]

39:15.186 --> 39:17.922
You have been seeing too much.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.224
It is time to silence you.

39:20.324 --> 39:22.093
[grunts] Mortikov, what are you doing?

39:22.193 --> 39:23.728
This isn't the boy who came all this way

39:23.828 --> 39:25.930
from living in that garbage dump!

39:26.030 --> 39:27.665
[Mortikov laughing]

39:27.732 --> 39:31.102
I think you'll find it is boy.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.436
What would your mother think?

39:32.536 --> 39:33.604
Mother would have

39:33.704 --> 39:36.240
-killed you at dinner. -What?

39:36.340 --> 39:39.009
And now, I will follow her example.

39:39.076 --> 39:40.177
[laughing]

39:42.546 --> 39:44.548
Now you say, "Goodbye."

39:44.615 --> 39:46.450
-[Mera] Hey, short stop! -Huh?

39:46.550 --> 39:49.120
-Batter up! -[grunts]

39:49.220 --> 39:50.721
-[fish squeaking] -[yelling]

39:53.557 --> 39:54.692
[groaning]

39:54.759 --> 39:56.460
Well, that was exactly as satisfying

39:56.560 --> 39:58.462
-as I thought it would be. -Looked like it.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.197
-[Mortikov groaning] -What's with the crystal?

40:00.264 --> 40:03.067
I don't know. But if I do this...

40:08.572 --> 40:10.040
[rumbling]

40:11.375 --> 40:14.478
-Uh-oh. -Maybe that was a bad idea.

40:14.578 --> 40:16.947
Huh? You fool, you doomed us!

40:17.047 --> 40:18.549
-Come on, it can't be that bad. -Huh?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.285
[Mera] Never mind. We're doomed.

40:25.055 --> 40:26.157
Hey, what's happening?

40:26.257 --> 40:27.758
Dum-Dum turned off crystal.

40:27.825 --> 40:30.161
Now whole drill collapse and we all die!

40:30.261 --> 40:31.595
Why did you do that?

40:31.662 --> 40:33.164
I'm not sure!

40:33.264 --> 40:34.632
-[grunting] -[clanking]

40:38.569 --> 40:40.171
[both yelling]

40:40.271 --> 40:42.573
[Mortikov screaming]

40:42.640 --> 40:44.742
Wait! Everyone stop screaming and listen.

40:44.809 --> 40:46.744
-[rumbling in distance] -[all] Huh?

40:47.411 --> 40:48.245
Huh?

40:49.847 --> 40:51.682
[Aquaman] The water, it's coming back!

40:51.782 --> 40:53.984
Okay, guys. We're going to have to jump.

41:00.991 --> 41:02.293
[Aquaman] Hmm.

41:02.359 --> 41:04.195
-You ready? -[Mera] Mmm-hmm.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.596
All right.

41:05.663 --> 41:08.799
Okay. Jump!

41:11.135 --> 41:12.169
[all screaming]

41:25.483 --> 41:26.317
[gasping]

41:29.720 --> 41:31.789
-[yelling] -Huh?

41:35.693 --> 41:36.961
Huh? [gasps]

41:40.164 --> 41:41.131
Everyone okay?

41:41.198 --> 41:42.733
[groaning]

41:42.833 --> 41:43.801
Hello!

41:43.868 --> 41:45.536
-Yeah, I think so. -Look!

41:47.905 --> 41:50.074
I can see my house. [giggles]

41:50.174 --> 41:52.309
And my house!

41:52.376 --> 41:55.246
And my even more baseball bats!

41:55.980 --> 41:58.549
[struggling]

42:02.586 --> 42:04.388
[gasping]

42:04.488 --> 42:05.656

42:05.723 --> 42:08.058
-[Aquaman grunts] -[chuckles nervously]

42:08.158 --> 42:10.427
Hello.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.096
[Aquaman] All right. That should do it.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.431
Thanks again for helping us patch up the Mudskipper.

42:14.532 --> 42:18.936
I guess I'll tell Atlantis you guys are all fine now.

42:19.036 --> 42:21.071
Because of you, Aquaman.

42:21.171 --> 42:22.273
[bandits grunt]

42:22.373 --> 42:24.942
You've not only saved us from Mortikov,

42:25.042 --> 42:27.378
you've brought us all together.

42:28.712 --> 42:31.115
[laughs bashfully] That's not necessary.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.717
Yeah, you showed us that we can accomplish more

42:33.784 --> 42:37.855
by working with the townspeople instead of robbing them.

42:37.922 --> 42:40.257
Wow. I guess I did, huh?

42:40.357 --> 42:42.092
Yeah. And you showed us...

42:42.192 --> 42:45.062
Well, we always knew the bandits shouldn't rob us.

42:45.129 --> 42:46.063
-[Gillian growls] -[yelps]

42:46.130 --> 42:47.464
But I appreciate the help.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.935
Actually, you showed me I was wrong about kings.

42:51.035 --> 42:52.303
Ooh. Really?

42:52.403 --> 42:54.138
Yeah. I always thought kings were terrible,

42:54.238 --> 42:57.207
but actually, the problem was that our king was Ocean Master.

42:57.274 --> 43:00.811
Yeah. Come to think of it, Ocean Master stunk as a king.

43:00.911 --> 43:03.881
We were buried for a week and he didn't send anyone!

43:03.948 --> 43:05.482
[gasps] I know, right?

43:05.583 --> 43:06.717
And he thought you'd been gone

43:06.784 --> 43:08.819
-for seven years. -What?

43:08.919 --> 43:11.288
But Aquaman's not like Ocean Master.

43:11.388 --> 43:12.590
He's a great King!

43:12.656 --> 43:15.326
Yeah! Let's all hear it for King Aquaman!

43:15.426 --> 43:17.828
[all chanting] King Aquaman! King Aquaman!

43:17.928 --> 43:19.797
[Aquaman] Oh.

43:19.897 --> 43:22.566
Hey, my subjects are here. Inappropriate.

43:23.434 --> 43:24.735
Ah, okay. One more.

43:24.802 --> 43:27.838
King Aquaman! King Aquaman! King Aquaman!

43:27.938 --> 43:30.474
One more kiss! One more kiss!

43:30.574 --> 43:34.011
[laughing] Hold on. We just talked to Atlantis like a week ago.

43:35.946 --> 43:37.281
Eh. It's probably not important.

43:40.818 --> 43:41.852
[groaning]

43:45.623 --> 43:47.858
That was great!

43:47.958 --> 43:49.360
Told you. All you had to do was

43:49.460 --> 43:51.528
show the citizens what a good king you are.

43:51.629 --> 43:55.666
Yeah, you're right. Everyone at the palace was just so lukewarm on me.

43:55.766 --> 43:57.034
I was worried I was messing this up.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.335
You're doing great.

43:58.435 --> 43:59.970
Like, bringing the townspeople together

44:00.037 --> 44:02.640
with their former enemies? Very royal.

44:02.706 --> 44:05.109
That's what you do, bring people together.

44:05.175 --> 44:07.645
Like I bring together the land and the sea?

44:07.711 --> 44:11.148
I'm serious! That's why I knew you'd be a good king.

44:11.215 --> 44:13.884
You're not from here so you see how things could be different.

44:13.984 --> 44:16.487
It's a strength. I forget that sometimes.

44:16.553 --> 44:17.955
[Mortikov groaning]

44:19.657 --> 44:21.392
Aquaman returns!

44:24.662 --> 44:27.564
[chuckles] That was a long day.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.668
Let's get Mortikov into sea-jail and get some sleep.

44:30.734 --> 44:32.836
Yep. Then, first thing tomorrow I begin

44:32.903 --> 44:34.838
Operation Show-all-my-subjects

44:34.905 --> 44:36.740
that-I'm-awesome-at-being-king.

44:37.508 --> 44:38.742
Vulko, we're back!

44:38.842 --> 44:40.511
We've got a cool new crystal for you to study

44:40.577 --> 44:43.080
-and a crummy new criminal for you to jail! -[both gasp]

44:43.180 --> 44:45.249
Surprise, Aquaman!

44:45.349 --> 44:46.684
-What? -That's right.

44:46.750 --> 44:51.355
I, Ocean Master, am king once again!

44:51.422 --> 44:54.024
-What? -And with my armies rebuilt,

44:54.091 --> 44:58.095
I'm prepared to wage war on the surface world!

44:58.195 --> 45:00.497
-Vulko, what's the deal? -Oh, my bad.

45:00.564 --> 45:01.665
There was nothing I could do.

45:01.732 --> 45:04.201
You were gone for a whole year.

45:04.268 --> 45:06.770
[Aquaman and Mera screaming] What?

45:06.870 --> 45:07.905
No. Seriously. What?
