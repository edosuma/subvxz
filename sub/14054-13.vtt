00:00.583 --> 00:02.417
<i>- Previously on The O. C:
- You drink a lot?</i>

00:02.625 --> 00:04.292
I guess. I mean, what's a lot?

00:04.500 --> 00:07.167
Have you ever had so much to drink
that you blacked out?

00:07.333 --> 00:10.833
How much is the Land Trust
offering me for Balboa Heights?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.208
That's it?
That's your whole dog-and-pony show?

00:13.417 --> 00:15.375
- What are you doing Saturday?
- What are you doing Saturday?

00:15.542 --> 00:19.083
- I have a date with Summer.
- What are you doing Friday night?

00:27.958 --> 00:29.917
So, what's it gonna be, huh?

00:30.167 --> 00:34.375
You want your menorah or
a candy cane? Christmas or Hanukkah?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.667
Don't worry about it, buddy, because
in this house, you don't have to choose.

00:40.875 --> 00:45.083
Allow me to introduce you
to a little something I like to call...

00:45.583 --> 00:47.750
...Chrismukkah.
- Chrismukkah?

00:47.917 --> 00:50.250
That's right.
The new holiday sweeping the nation.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.667
- Hey, fellas, we got the tree.
- Hey.

00:52.833 --> 00:55.917
- Or at least the living room.
- Guys, a little help.

00:56.083 --> 00:59.458
I saved a spot for you right there.
Put your muscle into it.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.917
Excellent. To the right a little.
Don't hurt it.

01:02.083 --> 01:04.083
Those needles are brittle.
That's perfect.

01:04.292 --> 01:08.875
You guys, you guys. A-plus. A-plus.
I love the holidays. I love them all.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.042
- We didn't really know how to raise Seth.
- So I raised myself.

01:12.208 --> 01:15.375
In doing so, I created the greatest
superholiday known to mankind...

01:15.542 --> 01:19.417
...drawing on the best that Christianity
and Judaism have to offer.

01:19.917 --> 01:21.292
And you call it Chrismukkah?

01:21.958 --> 01:25.750
Just hearing you say it makes me feel
all festive. Allow me to elaborate.

01:25.917 --> 01:30.000
You see, for my father here, a poor,
struggling Jew growing up in the Bronx...

01:30.208 --> 01:32.000
...Christmas meant
Chinese food and a movie.

01:32.167 --> 01:34.333
For my mom here,
Waspy McWasp...

01:34.458 --> 01:37.083
...well, it meant a tree,
stockings and all the trimmings.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.000
- Isn't that right?
- We're very proud.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.417
- I'm not a Wasp.
- Sure.

01:40.625 --> 01:44.583
Highlights include eight days of presents
followed by one of many presents.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.458
So, what do you think?

01:47.250 --> 01:50.500
- Sounds great for you guys.
- For you too.

01:50.708 --> 01:53.667
Hey, dip a toe in the Chrismukkah pool.
There's room for all of us.

01:53.875 --> 01:57.208
Isn't there an Atwood family tradition
you'd like to incorporate...

01:57.375 --> 01:59.625
...into Seth's  Êber-holiday?
- Yeah.

02:00.375 --> 02:03.333
Atwood and holidays
is not a good combination.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.833
- What did you guys do?
- No, seriously, thanks, but...

02:07.083 --> 02:09.167
Come on, man,
there's got to be something.

02:10.042 --> 02:13.000
My holiday memories pretty much
consist of my mom drunk...

02:13.208 --> 02:15.000
...and me getting my ass kicked.

02:17.292 --> 02:19.833
Well, this year will be entirely different.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.667
New memories. It'll be great.

02:24.417 --> 02:26.458
Yeah. Well, I'll do
whatever you want me to.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.833
That's the spirit. Come here.

02:33.083 --> 02:35.750
<i>- Oy humbug.
- It's a big holiday for anyone.</i>

02:35.917 --> 02:39.042
Yeah, I'm still wrapping my head
around it. Give him some time.

02:39.208 --> 02:41.625
Why don't we trim the tree?

02:41.792 --> 02:45.917
You know what, you guys? Soon Ryan
will learn the magic of Chrismukkah.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.500
Worry not. I will convert him.

03:32.583 --> 03:35.750
I was gone five minutes.
How did this turn into Santa's workshop?

03:35.875 --> 03:39.125
I see someone took down the wreath
I hung on the door.

03:39.292 --> 03:41.000
It fell. What are you wrapping?

03:41.167 --> 03:44.583
Two Seth Cohen starter packs. We got
Death Cab, Bright Eyes, The Shins...

03:44.750 --> 03:46.375
<i>...Kavalier & Clay and Goonies.</i>

03:46.542 --> 03:50.292
It's not just for kids, Ryan, it's not.
I don't care what they tell you.

03:50.458 --> 03:53.042
Summer and Anna
are gonna love them both equally.

03:53.208 --> 03:54.833
You're getting them the same thing?

03:55.042 --> 03:57.792
Yes, I am. Sometimes I'm so crafty,
I surprise myself.

03:57.958 --> 03:59.583
No good can come of this,
you know that.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.042
Nope, I don't.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.000
- You're gonna have to choose, man.
- Hey.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.458
Not on Chrismukkah, I don't. Okay?
There's no choosing in Chrismukkah.

04:06.625 --> 04:10.042
- Well, you didn't get me anything, right?
- No.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.208
Come on, man, lighten up.

04:16.666 --> 04:20.166
Okay, fine. Stay dark. Dark works too.

04:26.625 --> 04:29.333
- Oh, Ryan, what is your shoe size?
- Why?

04:29.875 --> 04:32.667
- No reason.
- Might that be a Chrismukkah list?

04:32.875 --> 04:34.500
- No. Why do you ask?
- Okay.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.458
- Let me just see it, then, real fast.
- It's work.

04:37.625 --> 04:40.625
- I love your work. It fascinates me.
- I thought you said no gifts.

04:40.875 --> 04:45.042
- Well, we did. As in, no gifts for us.
- All right. All right.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.292
Well, Chrismukkah's ruined.

04:48.042 --> 04:50.375
Don't even say it. It's unruinable.

04:50.542 --> 04:52.667
It's got twice the resistance
of any normal holiday.

04:52.833 --> 04:55.375
Your father refused our settlement offer.
He wants a trial.

04:55.542 --> 04:58.500
That's not what he said yesterday.
He said if you met his offer...

04:58.667 --> 05:01.167
As of this morning,
Scrooge wants to go to court...

05:01.375 --> 05:04.542
...which means I have to spend
the holidays preparing for trial.

05:04.667 --> 05:05.833
Because with Rachel
out...

05:06.000 --> 05:10.167
Chrismukkah is ruined. Sooner or later
we will get through a holiday around here.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.458
Stop it right now, okay?

05:11.667 --> 05:15.792
Don't give up on the miracle that is
Chrismukkah. What is happening to you...?

05:16.167 --> 05:20.875
You'll see. You'll see too.
You'll all see. You'll all see.

05:21.042 --> 05:23.417
- You're starting to scare me.
- I'm okay with that.

05:23.583 --> 05:27.958
Okey-dokey, here we go.
Which tie? What are you thinking?

05:28.125 --> 05:32.083
This one? All right? Or...

05:32.250 --> 05:35.917
- The second one, definitely.
- All right.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.250
- So you have a job interview today?
- It's just a meet and greet.

05:40.417 --> 05:43.958
But we gotta dress for success, right?

05:44.583 --> 05:46.917
Look, I'm working on it, kiddo.

05:47.125 --> 05:51.875
I'll find a job. I know there's a lot
of extra pressure on the holidays.

05:52.042 --> 05:53.708
There doesn't have to be pressure...

05:53.875 --> 05:57.958
...because there doesn't have to be
any holidays. Really.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.875
- What do you mean?
- We can skip Christmas. It's not like...

06:01.042 --> 06:05.250
...it's not gonna happen again next year,
and holidays just make people depressed.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.667
Are you? Depressed?

06:08.875 --> 06:11.708
You were supposed to go
to therapy after Mexico. We never...

06:11.875 --> 06:14.167
- I'm great. I'm just saying.
- Okay. Good.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.458
Because we're not skipping
Christmas. Come on.

06:17.625 --> 06:21.000
I'll find a job, we'll figure out
a way to make this whole thing work...

06:21.125 --> 06:23.708
...and we're gonna have
lots to celebrate about, okay?

06:23.917 --> 06:26.875
Come on. Skipping Christmas.

06:27.042 --> 06:30.125
- You sure about this tie?
- Yeah, definitely.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.167
- All right.
- You look great.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.875
Skipping Christmas.
What are you, the Grinch?

06:38.333 --> 06:40.958
So Summer and Anna
are both coming to this party?

06:41.167 --> 06:43.292
- But neither one's my date.
- They know that?

06:43.458 --> 06:45.375
Yeah, in theory they both know that.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.875
Come on, man, relax.
It's a big party, okay?

06:48.042 --> 06:50.542
You might be all doom and gloom,
but me? Check it out.

06:50.667 --> 06:53.542
I'm snowflakes. I'm latkes.
Chrismukkah is coming.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.667
And when Chrismukkah ends?

06:57.208 --> 06:59.833
- I hate when Chrismukkah ends.
- Cohen.

07:00.167 --> 07:03.250
Hi, Ryan. I wanted to know
what the deal was for tonight.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.708
If you were driving,
or should I pick you up?

07:05.917 --> 07:08.875
Hey, Seth. So, what time
are you thinking for tonight?

07:13.833 --> 07:16.125
- Hey, Summer.
- Hey, Anna.

07:16.542 --> 07:20.958
You guys. I was thinking that
we should all probably meet there.

07:21.125 --> 07:24.500
How about that? At whatever time
you choose, by whatever means.

07:26.292 --> 07:29.583
- Sounds great.
- Yeah. Perfect.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.292
You'd better pray
for a Chrismukkah miracle.

07:35.292 --> 07:37.708
I've got Jesus and Moses
on my side, man.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.667
Yeah, make sure all that
goes all the way around the bottom.

07:44.833 --> 07:49.333
Now, guys, the balls are the key
to the whole tree. They need to breathe.

07:51.917 --> 07:55.000
Hey, Kirsten, what do you think?

07:55.167 --> 07:58.167
- It's really something.
- You don't like it?

07:58.333 --> 08:03.458
It's not that. It's just that my mom used
to put the Christmas tree in the foyer.

08:03.625 --> 08:07.333
- It's just a tradition that we have.
- Yeah, Caleb told me.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.333
But then I thought, "You know,
the holidays are hard enough."

08:10.500 --> 08:13.083
Your father doesn't need
to be reminded of the past.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.250
Caleb needs to enjoy this Christmas.

08:15.417 --> 08:17.792
And did Caleb tell you
we need to borrow your office?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.583
We're doing the Santa thing for the kids,
and we need a holding area for the elves.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.167
What are you doing here?
Your father said...

08:23.333 --> 08:25.458
...you're working from home.
- He did?

08:25.583 --> 08:28.000
He's just
full of surprises.

08:29.208 --> 08:33.417
I changed my mind. If the Land Trust
can come up with $200 million...

08:33.582 --> 08:36.332
...then surely they can come up
with $300 million.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.042
I thought this was over.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.250
You can always get more blood
from the stone.

08:40.457 --> 08:42.750
But the stone is my husband.

08:42.917 --> 08:44.792
Let's spend the holidays working.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.750
- That sounds good. You have fun.
- What are you talking about?

08:48.917 --> 08:51.667
I'm gonna do something
that I haven't done in...

08:52.750 --> 08:53.917
...ever.

08:54.083 --> 08:57.917
- I'm taking Christmas vacation.
- Don't be ridiculous, Kiki.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.375
- You hate sitting around.
- Not as much as I hate fighting with you.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.000
So you spend two weeks
buried in legal documents.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.458
I'm gonna be wrapping gifts.

09:07.417 --> 09:11.750
- I hate Christmas.
- Well, Chrismukkah's not much better.

09:11.917 --> 09:14.917
You don't wanna know.
Holidays make what's bad even worse.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.583
I just wish my dad
would drop the act.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.333
I don't need it.
And I don't need Christmas.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.083
Who do you have to spend it with?

09:21.292 --> 09:23.917
Christmas Eve with my dad,
Christmas Day with my mom.

09:24.083 --> 09:27.042
Plus, she's making me go to a stupid
Newport Group party tonight.

09:27.208 --> 09:30.667
- The Cohens are going too, so...
- So at least we'll be miserable together.

09:31.083 --> 09:34.458
- Deal?
- Deal. So am I seeing you after school?

09:34.625 --> 09:38.167
I got some stuff to do,
some shopping. South Coast Plaza.

09:38.333 --> 09:41.417
You're going to South Coast Plaza?
Alone?

09:41.625 --> 09:42.792
I don't think
you're ready for that.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.292
You need a seasoned expert
to protect you.

09:46.042 --> 09:48.958
Well, you know someone?

10:28.083 --> 10:29.792
So no luck, huh?

10:29.958 --> 10:32.625
There's a 99-cent store down the street.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.333
I guess I can't really afford
this place anymore.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.292
Why did we come?

10:40.708 --> 10:44.250
I know it sounds stupid,
but I like it here.

10:44.417 --> 10:47.167
Everything is so perfect.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.208
You walk around feeling
like your problems...

10:49.417 --> 10:52.167
...can be solved by
the right nail polish...

10:52.333 --> 10:54.042
...or a new pair of shoes.

10:59.167 --> 11:01.750
Miss, I'm gonna have to ask
to see your purse.

11:01.917 --> 11:04.750
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I can't let you leave the premises.

11:04.917 --> 11:08.083
If you don't hand over your purse,
I'll have to call the police.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.667
Look, back off, all right?

11:09.833 --> 11:12.083
- Ryan, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

11:12.292 --> 11:14.083
Your purse. Now.

11:17.958 --> 11:20.167
What are you doing?

11:50.792 --> 11:52.542
What are you doing?
Working from home?

11:52.708 --> 11:54.875
- I'm on vacation.
- Yes. Clearly.

11:55.083 --> 11:58.833
- I find reviewing accounts to be relaxing.
- I hope that's a recessive gene.

11:59.042 --> 12:00.958
You should be so lucky.

12:01.167 --> 12:05.792
Look, I haven't taken a vacation
in a while, and I'm easing into it.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.833
- I don't judge. I only mock.
- That you get from your father.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.042
Oh, my God, they're coming in?

12:11.208 --> 12:15.000
Oh, the... I got you. What are those?

12:15.167 --> 12:18.375
They came for Ryan
from his mom and his brother.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.833
You know what he said
about the holidays?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.833
When he talks like that,
I have no idea what to say.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.875
Me neither. You just have
to be yourself.

12:28.042 --> 12:29.458
Yeah, because that
always works so well.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.708
Being a family is hard
under any circumstance.

12:32.917 --> 12:37.625
Creating a new one?
That's gotta feel weird sometimes.

12:37.792 --> 12:40.625
Feeling weird is
right in my wheelhouse.

12:43.667 --> 12:47.083
What is it? Is Grandpa going crazy
with the company credit card again?

12:47.292 --> 12:50.167
What is it this time? Hookers?
A little blow, perhaps?

12:50.333 --> 12:52.250
Grandpa likes to dance
with ye white lady?

12:52.417 --> 12:55.917
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. What is it?

12:56.083 --> 12:57.542
It's... Hopefully, it's nothing.

12:57.708 --> 13:00.500
You should go get ready,
because we have to be there soon.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.167
I'll go put on my face.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.167
Hi. This is Kirsten Cohen
from the Newport Group.

13:15.292 --> 13:19.375
My father ordered a survey of
the Balboa Heights and I've lost my copy.

13:19.500 --> 13:24.625
I really need to see the document.
Is it possible for you to fax it over to me?

13:31.583 --> 13:34.458
- I cannot believe this. Marissa?
- Julie.

13:34.625 --> 13:37.750
Look, I have to host the most important
event of my career tonight.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.792
At least your priorities are in order.

13:39.958 --> 13:43.500
You know, it's amazing how these
calamities keep happening on your watch.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.792
Oh, so I'm to blame for this one too?

13:45.958 --> 13:47.917
- Where did she learn to steal?
- Stop it.

13:48.292 --> 13:51.958
I'm the one who stole, remember?
I'm the one to blame, not Dad.

13:52.125 --> 13:55.375
Look, we're lucky the store
is not pressing charges.

13:55.583 --> 13:58.667
Okay? Marissa and I were deciding
what an appropriate punishment...

13:58.833 --> 14:04.042
Oh, really? Well, way to rule with
the iron fist, Stalin, but it's not up to her.

14:04.250 --> 14:08.042
- No car, no allowance, no weekends.
- So I can stay home tonight?

14:08.208 --> 14:13.083
Starting tomorrow. I won't have my
party ruined by your little sticky fingers.

14:13.708 --> 14:19.333
Look, sweetie, I know that this time of
year makes everything bad seem worse.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.875
But why did you do this?

14:24.250 --> 14:26.792
I thought it would be...

14:27.333 --> 14:29.333
Look, I wasn't...

14:32.958 --> 14:34.000
It was stupid.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.125
I called the therapist
on the way over.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.333
- Mom.
- She's right, kiddo.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.625
Therapy was part of the deal
of you moving in.

14:40.792 --> 14:44.083
Okay, look, I've been doing
way better since Mexico.

14:44.292 --> 14:47.083
4.0 first quarter.
Charity League, social chair.

14:47.250 --> 14:50.875
I scheduled you an appointment
tomorrow with Dr. Milano. He's great.

14:51.167 --> 14:55.167
I'm sorry, but I can handle it.

14:55.333 --> 14:59.167
This. L... I won't do it again, I promise.

14:59.875 --> 15:02.833
Honey, I love you.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.375
But I don't believe you.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.500
You might actually find it helpful.

15:11.625 --> 15:14.042
Yeah. Whatever. I need to get ready.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.167
And, Mom, you have your
big party to throw.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.542
I'm sure you don't want to keep
Caleb waiting.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.417
Hey. What's up, man? You're back.

15:29.667 --> 15:33.333
So that's pretty cool, right?
Your mom and brother got you something.

15:33.542 --> 15:36.500
Yeah. Except now I have
a total of eight gifts to buy.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.042
I only saved enough for one.

15:38.167 --> 15:42.625
Ryan, that sort of reminds me
of the story of Hanukkah, dude.

15:42.792 --> 15:47.500
Check it out. The lamp... You know what?
I think you get the gist.

15:47.667 --> 15:51.417
- How was the mall?
- Weird.

15:52.292 --> 15:55.250
You've really painted a picture for me.
I feel like I was there.

15:55.417 --> 15:58.292
Marissa picked up a few things
without paying for them.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.958
- What? As in...
- Shoplifting.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.833
Yeah.

16:04.375 --> 16:06.833
- Yeah, that's weird.
- It's the time of year.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.542
And with everything that's going on
with her family...

16:09.750 --> 16:12.542
- Yeah, I'm sure it's gotta be hard for her.
- Yeah.

16:12.708 --> 16:17.083
I just wish there was something
I could do or say.

16:19.542 --> 16:20.667
Oh, I got you something.

16:20.833 --> 16:25.042
- No, no, no. We had an agreement.
- But this is different, this is a requirement.

16:25.250 --> 16:30.500
I know it's a bit minty, but, you know,
we all have one, so we just thought...

16:32.000 --> 16:33.583
No, that's cool.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.708
Well, good. Maybe it'll meet
a kinder fate than your wreath did.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.250
But, if not, we still
wanted you to have it.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.250
- Thanks.
- All right.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.750
I'm gonna go
make magic happen.

16:42.917 --> 16:45.958
I feel like my hair's
working for me tonight.

16:55.917 --> 16:58.458
I'm late. I know. I know.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.500
I'll hurry.
You're not gonna believe this...

17:02.667 --> 17:05.166
...but your father and I
reached a settlement today.

17:05.333 --> 17:08.500
He gouged me a little.
Well, you know, he gouged me a lot.

17:08.666 --> 17:13.708
- He asked you for more money?
- Just $250 million.

17:13.875 --> 17:14.958
But we closed the deal.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.333
- He claims that he did it because of you.
- Is that what he told you?

17:18.500 --> 17:21.166
It seems your vacation
really hit him hard.

17:21.375 --> 17:25.333
Because he says he wants
to spend the holidays as a family.

17:26.041 --> 17:29.958
You know, maybe...
Maybe he's changing.

17:30.125 --> 17:35.208
Or maybe he is a truly fantastic liar.
What's wrong?

17:41.333 --> 17:42.667
I found something today.

17:42.958 --> 17:46.875
And I don't know if I can give it to you,
but I don't know if I can't.

17:47.042 --> 17:51.667
- Okay, well...
- He's gonna know that I gave this to you.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.500
And he's gonna have
every right to fire me.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.000
You have got to be kidding me.

18:15.458 --> 18:16.875
This changes everything.

18:17.042 --> 18:21.083
And I'm gonna have to learn how to relax,
because I'm gonna have a lot of free time.

18:22.208 --> 18:26.667
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Not as sorry as he's gonna be.

18:28.333 --> 18:32.625
- You still wanna go to the party?
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

18:49.417 --> 18:52.208
- Anna. Hey.
- Mistletoe.

18:53.125 --> 18:56.375
That's very festive of you.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.375
I thought we were meeting there.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.458
I was thinking maybe
we could go together.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.250
I would love to.
You know I would.

19:02.417 --> 19:04.292
But don't you think
that would violate...

19:04.458 --> 19:06.583
...our little Geneva Convention
of dating we have?

19:06.750 --> 19:08.917
Because I told Summer
I'd meet you both there.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.208
Well, how is Summer ever gonna know?

19:15.083 --> 19:18.292
- Mistletoe. What is she doing here?
- What are you doing here?

19:18.500 --> 19:20.875
- I thought we had a deal, Cohen.
- Which you violated.

19:21.042 --> 19:22.667
- As did you.
- She's got a point.

19:22.833 --> 19:26.083
- You're on her side?
- No. There are no sides, you guys.

19:26.250 --> 19:30.750
There's only rides. With my parents.
We'll all go together.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.708
- Fine.
- Fine.

19:48.708 --> 19:53.708
So I have a gift for you.
I'll give it to you later.

19:53.875 --> 19:59.500
I have a present for you too.
I'll also give it to you later.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.792
I can't wait.

20:01.958 --> 20:03.958
For either.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.792
For both.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.500
Seth, are you ready?
Come on, let's go.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.583
Hi, Summer. Anna.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.417
Ladies.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.250
Oh, this is gonna be some party.

20:19.958 --> 20:23.167
You know, maybe it's not
such a bad idea.

20:24.125 --> 20:26.000
What does that mean?

20:26.167 --> 20:28.250
It might be good
to have someone to talk to.

20:28.417 --> 20:31.958
- You're someone. I can't talk to you?
- You can talk to me, it's just...

20:32.125 --> 20:35.625
What? I need the help of a trained
professional because I stole a lipstick?

20:35.792 --> 20:39.750
- It's not about the lipstick.
- Then I guess I don't see what it's about.

20:40.667 --> 20:43.708
- You should do what you want.
- I will.

20:43.875 --> 20:47.250
If no one's making my parents
go to therapy, then no one's making me.

20:47.375 --> 20:50.667
You know, I'm the only
normal one in this family.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.500
Sorry.

20:56.458 --> 21:00.250
I think I left my wrap upstairs. Could you
grab it for me? I need to get my purse.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.292
Sure.

21:41.167 --> 21:43.333
Mushroom crescent?
Crab and brie phyllo?

21:43.500 --> 21:45.792
Come on, buddy.
Change it up a little bit.

21:45.958 --> 21:47.833
Enjoy the party.

21:48.333 --> 21:51.125
Come on, Seth. I'm going this way.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.458
I'm going this way.

21:53.625 --> 21:57.375
Oh, you guys are?
I'm gonna go look for Ryan. Excuse me.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.833
Kirsten, Sandy, welcome.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.500
- Kiki.
- Hey.

22:03.750 --> 22:06.458
Great to see you.
Did Sandman give you our good news?

22:06.833 --> 22:08.583
- He did.
- I need to follow up...

22:08.792 --> 22:10.417
...on some things with you,
if you don't mind...

22:10.583 --> 22:11.917
Come, Sanford, it's a party.

22:12.083 --> 22:15.292
Look back on your Berkeley days.
Maybe you can smoke the tree.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.833
Smoke the tree. Funny.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.042
I'm gonna nail him now.

22:21.958 --> 22:24.250
- So, what do you think?
- About?

22:24.417 --> 22:26.625
The party. You haven't said anything.
Like it?

22:26.792 --> 22:28.500
I mean, I know how you feel
about the tree...

22:28.667 --> 22:30.333
...but if you can get past that.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.333
- It's great.
- And what did Caleb think?

22:32.458 --> 22:36.458
- I mean, has he said anything to you?
- I haven't had a chance to talk to him.

22:36.667 --> 22:39.833
I just want this to be
a party that he'll never forget.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.458
I think you have a shot.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.375
- You okay?
- Yeah. Why?

22:56.958 --> 22:58.083
I don't know.

22:58.250 --> 23:00.042
Today's been kind of intense...

23:00.250 --> 23:02.958
...and I know you don't
really wanna be here.

23:03.125 --> 23:06.125
I wanna be where you are,
and you're here, so...

23:08.250 --> 23:12.167
Marissa.
Oh, you wore the Chanel. How pretty.

23:12.333 --> 23:15.000
Ryan. You haven't said hello to Caleb yet.

23:15.167 --> 23:18.250
He was talking to other people,
and I didn't want to interrupt.

23:18.417 --> 23:20.292
- He's ready now, so...
- I'm not.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.292
- Marissa.
- Mom.

23:22.417 --> 23:24.875
- You are a guest at this party.
- You made me come.

23:25.083 --> 23:28.083
- You're in enough trouble.
- Then I guess I've got nothing to lose.

23:28.292 --> 23:31.542
- This is the way it's gonna be?
- I don't know. I'll ask my shrink.

23:33.417 --> 23:36.083
You know what,
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

23:37.458 --> 23:41.167
- I hate the holidays.
- Right there with you.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.500
Caleb. You have time to talk?

23:47.667 --> 23:50.042
- No.
- Come on, make some.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.958
- What is this?
- A geological survey of the Heights...

23:56.083 --> 23:59.625
...which you commissioned and somehow
failed to turn over to my office.

23:59.833 --> 24:01.625
- I've no time for this.
- I think you do.

24:01.833 --> 24:03.625
Allow me to summarize what you know.

24:03.833 --> 24:07.250
The Heights are seismologically unsound,
the whole area is uninsurable.

24:07.417 --> 24:10.417
- It's worthless.
- As is your theory.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.083
There's no way
you'd have gotten a building permit.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.292
- And you knew that.
- What do you want, Sandy?

24:15.417 --> 24:17.708
I wanna buy back the Heights.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.500
For a dollar.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.125
You cannot be serious.

24:25.292 --> 24:27.417
Merry Christmas.

24:30.333 --> 24:33.125
So are you ready for your present?

24:33.292 --> 24:36.750
Yeah, I'm ready. Hand me the keys.
I'll learn to drive stick eventually.

24:36.917 --> 24:39.083
Very funny, Seth.
Always have to ruin the mood.

24:39.250 --> 24:40.333
That's what I do.

24:41.375 --> 24:42.792
Ready?

24:51.042 --> 24:54.042
<i>The Adventures of Seth Cohen
and Captain Oats.</i>

24:54.208 --> 24:56.292
<i>Volume 1: "Confidence."</i>

24:56.458 --> 24:59.292
- You made this?
- No, I bought it on eBay.

24:59.417 --> 25:02.042
I can't believe you did this.
This is amazing.

25:03.167 --> 25:06.167
Hey, this Seth in the story
seems really handsome and awesome.

25:06.333 --> 25:10.583
- I guess I took some liberties.
- You dumbed him down a little bit.

25:19.958 --> 25:22.167
- This is fantastic.
- Thanks.

25:23.417 --> 25:27.000
- So how's Seth doing?
- He's fine, I think.

25:27.167 --> 25:30.542
It's hard to tell
with him sometimes. Why?

25:31.542 --> 25:34.958
Does he ever do things that sort of...

25:35.125 --> 25:38.333
...make you question yourself
as a parent?

25:39.833 --> 25:44.042
Well, there was the model home
and Tijuana...

25:44.208 --> 25:45.667
...and a thing with the Range Rover...

25:45.875 --> 25:48.542
...and an IMAX movie that
I didn't quite buy.

25:48.708 --> 25:52.708
But they're kids. I mean, they do stuff.
They get in trouble, right?

25:52.917 --> 25:55.875
Our parents would've had a heart attack
if they knew what we did.

25:56.083 --> 26:00.667
Come on, we were good kids.
We were. Weren't we?

26:00.833 --> 26:02.667
- We were good kids.
- Yeah.

26:02.833 --> 26:05.500
And we have good kids.

26:45.708 --> 26:48.125
Okay, hang on for a second.
What are we doing here?

26:48.292 --> 26:51.458
Because Anna went to get drinks.
She'll be back in, like, one second.

26:51.625 --> 26:53.708
- Come here.
- Why?

26:53.875 --> 26:55.417
- Just come here.
- Okay.

26:57.500 --> 26:58.792
Stay there.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.583
I hear you like comic books, Cohen.

27:10.167 --> 27:12.083
This is true.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.333
Merry Christmas.

27:27.667 --> 27:30.292
Good Lord, I think I'm gonna pass out.

27:32.125 --> 27:35.667
- You're not going anywhere.
- Okay.

27:41.958 --> 27:44.542
- Yes?
- What's this?

27:45.292 --> 27:47.167
That's Anna's present.
She made it for me.

27:47.625 --> 27:50.375
- She made it?
- Yeah.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.458
It's amazing.

27:52.625 --> 27:55.542
I know, but your present's amazing too.
It's really amazing.

27:56.958 --> 27:58.833
Hey, there you...

27:59.000 --> 28:00.542
...are.

28:01.333 --> 28:04.833
Hey, Anna, Summer was just
giving me her gift. It's cool.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.292
- You're Wonder Woman?
- Yeah. So?

28:08.542 --> 28:10.583
I mean, you look...

28:10.750 --> 28:12.583
...amazing.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.708
Is that my story?

28:16.167 --> 28:20.667
My God, I made you a comic book.
What am I, 8?

28:21.708 --> 28:23.125
Way to go, Wonder Whore.

28:23.292 --> 28:25.292
Hey, Wonder Woman's not
a whore, okay? Stop.

28:25.458 --> 28:27.875
- What are we doing?
- I don't know, this is nuts.

28:28.042 --> 28:29.667
Hold up, you guys, one second.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.917
Let's not have one speed bump
derail the whole train, okay?

28:33.083 --> 28:35.625
Let's not throw the baby out
with the bath water.

28:36.333 --> 28:38.292
- Let's make some more metaphors.
- Look...

28:38.458 --> 28:43.333
...I'm not into talking about, like,
feelings or whatever...

28:43.500 --> 28:44.667
...but I like you.

28:44.833 --> 28:47.208
Okay, and so does she.

28:49.042 --> 28:52.542
- Lf we don't put an end to this soon...
- Someone's gonna get hurt.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.250
You gotta choose, Cohen.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.958
Did you miss me?

29:12.333 --> 29:15.167
- Come on, let's dance.
- You know how I feel about dancing.

29:15.333 --> 29:18.083
You know how I don't care.
Come on, it's a party.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.083
Yeah, an office party.

29:20.250 --> 29:24.500
I thought you wanted to have fun.
Don't make me make you have fun.

29:26.083 --> 29:28.083
I'm guessing that's not eggnog.

29:28.250 --> 29:32.458
So what? Come on, if you don't wanna
dance we could just get out of here.

29:32.625 --> 29:37.333
- I didn't see you with a cocktail.
- Well, maybe I brought my own.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.250
Want some?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.458
What's going on with you today?

29:42.250 --> 29:45.208
- What's the big deal? You drink.
- Not alone in the bathroom.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.833
I'm just having fun.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.417
When I met you,
you were passed out in your driveway.

29:49.583 --> 29:51.958
Then it was an alley in Mexico. It's like...

29:52.125 --> 29:53.750
It's like my mom all over again.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.083
Shut up.

29:56.250 --> 29:58.583
- We're getting out of here.
- No, I am.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.292
- Enjoy the party.
- You can't drive.

30:00.458 --> 30:05.000
Get your hands off of me. I have enough
people in my life telling me what to do.

30:07.167 --> 30:09.042
See you.

30:21.208 --> 30:23.208
- Come on, let me drive.
- Get away from me.

30:23.458 --> 30:24.625
Hey.

30:24.750 --> 30:26.250
Hey.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.250
I'm fine.

30:48.500 --> 30:52.333
And so, effective immediately,
I'm transferring the title of the Heights...

30:52.500 --> 30:55.917
...to the Balboa Land Trust
for the very reasonable price...

30:56.083 --> 30:57.458
...of $ 1.

31:02.167 --> 31:06.000
And I couldn't have done it without
the help of my son-in-law, Sandy Cohen.

31:09.042 --> 31:12.667
Thanks, Cal. But I can't take credit
for this. You did this all on your own.

31:12.833 --> 31:16.542
To Caleb Nichol, the most generous
man in Newport Beach.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.625
Thanks.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.875
Happy Hanukkah, Sandy.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.375
- Great.
- What? You're driving.

31:51.542 --> 31:54.250
- Yeah, because you're drunk.
- I'm not...

31:55.625 --> 31:57.125
Fine.

32:02.125 --> 32:04.167
- Where is it?
- Come on, put it away.

32:04.333 --> 32:06.208
- I'm trying.
- I'm still on probation.

32:06.375 --> 32:08.583
I said, I'm trying.

32:15.292 --> 32:17.583
Of course this is happening.

32:20.542 --> 32:22.458
Oh, God.

32:37.042 --> 32:40.792
Happy holidays. License. Registration.

32:41.458 --> 32:43.500
You got a broken tail light,
you know that?

32:43.708 --> 32:45.417
It just happened. I'll get it fixed.

32:46.625 --> 32:49.500
- You kids haven't been drinking?
- No, sir.

32:53.708 --> 32:57.167
- Everything all right here, miss?
- Yeah, fine. Thanks.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.125
<i>- Miss, would you...?
- We got a 459...</i>

33:01.292 --> 33:03.083
<i>... at 1508 Cornwall Lane
in West Cliff.</i>

33:03.250 --> 33:05.458
<i>All cars in the area
please respond immediately.</i>

33:05.917 --> 33:07.792
Copy that.

33:07.958 --> 33:10.083
I've got a call I need to get to.

33:10.292 --> 33:14.292
I'm gonna let you go with just a warning
for that tail light. You get that fixed.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.333
- Drive straight home.
- Yes, sir.

33:43.167 --> 33:45.042
Stop, okay? You're scaring me.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.667
Good. You're scaring me.

33:52.792 --> 33:56.958
There's drinking, crying, cops.
Well, it must be Christmas.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.125
I left this behind.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.708
I am not doing it again.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.833
Okay.

34:31.958 --> 34:33.750
Okay.

34:50.375 --> 34:52.500
Well, the ladies laid down the law.
It's over.

34:52.667 --> 34:55.167
- What are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.

34:55.333 --> 34:58.792
I don't know. No female's
ever really offered me a choice.

34:58.958 --> 35:01.958
I really only know
how to handle rejection and ridicule.

35:02.125 --> 35:05.375
I have a really good handle on ridicule.
How was your night?

35:06.583 --> 35:10.625
Marissa got drunk, and we got pulled over
by the cops with an open bottle of vodka.

35:10.792 --> 35:13.625
Hey, that Marissa's really
making life interesting for you.

35:13.792 --> 35:16.750
- Yeah. We got in a fight.
- What about the cop?

35:16.917 --> 35:21.750
Got a radio call. Let us off
with a warning for a busted tail light.

35:21.917 --> 35:25.417
- Now you see why I hate Christmas.
- Hang on a second, Ryan.

35:25.583 --> 35:30.583
It seems to me that what we have here
is a Chrismukkah miracle.

35:30.750 --> 35:34.333
Thank you. Think about it for a second.
The old Ryan, what would've happened?

35:34.500 --> 35:38.333
He would've got busted. For sure. But
this time, you had Jesus working for you.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.875
And you had Moses.
Working together. The super team.

35:41.083 --> 35:44.583
Fighting for you, to keep you safe
and give you a second chance.

35:44.750 --> 35:46.583
Touched by an angel.

35:46.750 --> 35:50.792
That's nice. It's got a good ring to it.
I believe my faith has been restored.

35:51.583 --> 35:52.958
I should go get ready.

35:53.125 --> 35:55.917
- Anna will be here soon.
- What are you going to tell her?

35:56.083 --> 35:57.958
I'm sure the words will come.

35:58.625 --> 36:02.125
All right, I just think that...

36:02.292 --> 36:04.708
...considering everything...
Actually, wait, hang on.

36:04.875 --> 36:07.792
Let me actually try another approach.

36:07.958 --> 36:12.500
<i>I think you're awesome,
and you're hilarious, and you're caliente.</i>

36:13.042 --> 36:17.125
And I think, you know,
you're extremely witty, and you're wise...

36:17.292 --> 36:20.958
...and I kind of can't believe
I'm actually gonna say this.

36:21.375 --> 36:23.333
But...

36:23.500 --> 36:26.000
...actually, I think
we should be friends.

36:26.167 --> 36:29.375
And I want you to have this.

36:29.542 --> 36:31.083
I don't wanna be your friend.

36:35.125 --> 36:37.125
I don't wanna be your friend.

36:44.750 --> 36:47.625
<i>You can never have
too many copies of The Goonies.</i>

37:02.250 --> 37:04.750
That was corporate espionage.
I could've fired you.

37:04.917 --> 37:06.667
Even sued you for breach
of confidentiality.

37:06.792 --> 37:10.708
Dad. You were extorting the county,
putting the company at huge risks.

37:10.875 --> 37:12.958
One day this was gonna come out.
Then what?

37:13.125 --> 37:17.375
When you found that report,
you could've shown me.

37:17.542 --> 37:19.667
You could've shown me
when it started.

37:19.875 --> 37:22.000
I'm sorry, but I just didn't see
any other way.

37:22.167 --> 37:27.667
It was dishonest,
calculating and ruthless. Kiki...

37:28.042 --> 37:30.583
...we just might make
a real-estate mogul out of you yet.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.500
Well, that's something to look forward to.

37:38.833 --> 37:41.833
Your mom's ornaments.
The tree looks nice.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.833
There may be a gift under there for you.

37:46.542 --> 37:48.000
Maybe.

37:49.708 --> 37:53.083
Hey, where you going?
We were thinking about getting a movie.

37:53.250 --> 37:55.167
Marissa's going to see her therapist.

37:55.333 --> 37:58.333
- She's going through a lot.
- Yeah, I thought I'd go with her.

37:59.125 --> 38:01.125
Yeah, you could...

38:01.292 --> 38:03.375
...or not.

38:05.167 --> 38:09.917
Marissa's gonna have to figure this
out by herself, and you gotta let her.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.083
You're here with us now.
You don't have to be the parent anymore.

38:17.750 --> 38:20.792
- A movie, huh?
- Yeah, but it's my pick.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.958
The selection of a movie
is something of an art.

39:03.083 --> 39:07.000
I came here three times before I
actually walked through that door.

39:10.750 --> 39:13.792
I know you. You go to Harbor, right?

39:14.625 --> 39:16.708
Marissa Cooper. Hi.

39:17.125 --> 39:21.792
You're the girl at school who
organizes things. Parties and stuff, right?

39:22.625 --> 39:24.958
Social chair is what that's called.

39:32.500 --> 39:36.708
- You go to Harbor?
- No. No, I go to Pacific.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.625
Oliver Trask.

39:42.208 --> 39:47.375
For a social chair... Well, I don't
find you to be very social at all.

39:47.542 --> 39:50.750
Gonna have to talk
to somebody about a recall.

39:50.917 --> 39:55.625
This is a psychiatrist's office.
It's kind of embarrassing.

39:55.833 --> 40:00.250
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
This is totally embarrassing.

40:00.917 --> 40:04.208
So let's address the obvious and move on.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.292
What's wrong with you?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.667
What is wrong with you?

40:16.208 --> 40:18.792
Well, if I knew, I wouldn't be here.

40:21.917 --> 40:24.625
You're not an alcoholic yet.

40:24.792 --> 40:26.250
You've OD'd at least once.

40:26.875 --> 40:30.583
Pills, I'd say.
Muscle relaxants, definitely.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.750
Painkillers.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
You didn't really want to hurt yourself.

40:40.167 --> 40:43.167
Kurt Cobain, yeah,
he wanted to hurt himself.

40:46.167 --> 40:48.375
You know, coming here wasn't my idea.

40:49.125 --> 40:53.083
Maybe not. But you wouldn't be here
if you didn't want to be.

40:54.292 --> 40:56.917
You want to know
why you are the way you are.

41:01.583 --> 41:04.458
That's you. I'm waiting on the next door.

41:06.667 --> 41:08.625
See you next week.

41:19.875 --> 41:21.917
How did it go with the girls?

41:22.083 --> 41:25.792
- Seth Cohen starter pack?
- I think I'm past that now.

41:28.375 --> 41:30.875
- Is that what I think it is?
- Figured I'd hang it.

41:31.375 --> 41:34.667
All right, man,
another Chrismukkah convert.

41:34.833 --> 41:35.833
Nice.

41:36.042 --> 41:40.458
I never doubted it for a second. Check it
out, I already put the hook up just in case.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.500
- Hey.
- All right, what'll it be?

41:45.667 --> 41:48.000
<i>Fiddler on the Roof,
It's a Wonderful Life...</i>

41:48.167 --> 41:51.000
<i>...or my selection,
Sylvester Stallone's Over the Top.</i>

41:51.167 --> 41:55.000
- Isn't that the arm-wrestling movie?
- Arm-wrestling classic.

41:55.208 --> 42:00.542
- Hey, merry Chrismukkah, you guys.
- Thank you.
