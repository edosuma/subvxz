00:56.760 --> 00:58.199
An eye for an eye?

00:58.280 --> 00:59.719
You're wrong.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.519
Revenge isn't sweet.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.919
It's an evil act.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.559
That will haunt you forever.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.559
Revenge is born out of helplessness.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.799
Overcome it and your
vindictive spirit will subside.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.799
Sometimes ignorance
can be the best revenge.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.039
Starring

02:13.240 --> 02:15.559
MR. VOLTA

02:17.680 --> 02:20.399
Based on a true story

02:34.840 --> 02:37.199
Music by

02:55.560 --> 02:57.919
Cinematography

02:59.760 --> 03:02.319
Written and Directed by

03:41.240 --> 03:43.639
One week before

03:50.560 --> 03:51.439
Stop!

03:52.360 --> 03:53.319
Fuck!

03:55.040 --> 03:56.039
Pull back!

04:05.640 --> 04:08.039
- Are you all right?
- She just popped up.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.119
- On a pedestrian crossing!
- I'm okay. Ouch...

04:13.200 --> 04:16.559
We'll take you to the hospital,
just in case.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.519
No need, really.

04:19.640 --> 04:23.119
No one will buy our story.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.039
- You just shut up, okay?
- Actually...

04:26.120 --> 04:28.359
What were you doing down there?

04:28.440 --> 04:29.559
Say what?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.959
We'll drop you off
anywhere you want.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.079
- To the center?
- We're headed elsewhere.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.559
No problem, really.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.279
I think she broke jail.
Let's stay out of it.

04:45.400 --> 04:46.759
That's ridiculous.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.479
And tactless.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.359
Relax.
I just dropped my keys.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.399
- Luckily the cover came off.
- You see?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.159
Please ignore him.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.319
Unbelievable!
Isn't she lucky?

05:01.640 --> 05:05.799
An unprecedented win
at this early stage!

05:06.720 --> 05:12.559
Ahead of us is the final round
of our quiz "One of a hundred".

05:14.320 --> 05:20.479
Our grand prize is
this gorgeous apartment

05:20.800 --> 05:23.079
in the city's prime location.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.679
You can quit now and keep
all you've won so far.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.079
Or risk losing it all if you fail,

05:29.160 --> 05:33.719
except our consolation prize:
a food processor.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.159
- Will you take the risk?
- Yes.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.519
- You sure?
- Yes.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.559
- Still time to quit.
- No.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.879
I already know the number.
What's your guess?

05:47.640 --> 05:53.239
No need to frown,
keep your pretty eyes open,

05:53.320 --> 05:56.919
watch and... ta-dah!

05:58.680 --> 06:00.239
Please concentrate.

06:03.960 --> 06:04.639
Eight...

06:05.680 --> 06:06.559
Seven...

06:07.400 --> 06:08.279
Six...

06:09.160 --> 06:10.159
Five...

06:10.240 --> 06:11.039
Four...

06:11.720 --> 06:12.919
Three... Hello!

06:13.360 --> 06:14.159
Two..

06:14.880 --> 06:15.719
One...

06:15.800 --> 06:17.959
Eighty.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.519
- Eighty, you said?
- Eighty, yes.

06:21.960 --> 06:22.839
Eighty?

06:23.800 --> 06:24.519
Sorry...

06:25.800 --> 06:27.719
...dear channel,
eighty it is!

06:28.120 --> 06:30.559
It's a scoop-the-pool win!

06:30.920 --> 06:33.959
First time ever
in this show!

06:34.880 --> 06:37.959
Ladies and gentlemen,
she takes it all!

06:38.400 --> 06:44.159
The trip to Bora Bora,
the Mercedes, and the chic apartment!

06:46.960 --> 06:48.079
Unthinkable.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.959
137 shows to date
and just three trips.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.999
What's the scam?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.359
Just a moment.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.879
Think, oh think!
Ten seconds left.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.679
Think-o.
Cinco in Spanish is...

07:12.280 --> 07:12.959
Five.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.319
There's a bonus.

07:18.400 --> 07:25.159
The correct answer will get you
ten boxes of Dry Martini.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.279
Dry.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.359
In German?

07:28.920 --> 07:29.719
Three.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.239
- Say it again.
- Three.

07:34.200 --> 07:40.159
No need to frown.
Watch and... ta-dah!

07:41.600 --> 07:43.439
Ochenta in Spanish?

07:45.200 --> 07:45.999
Eighty.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.519
They were in league.
Sue them.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.079
- What about other numbers?
- They were prepared.

07:53.920 --> 07:54.799
"You know".

07:55.160 --> 07:57.199
Uno in Italian is one.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.239
"It's hot in here".
Hot sounds like six in Hungarian.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.759
T-shirt sounds like
nine in Hebrew.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.719
"Hot T-shirt" for 69.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.519
Sorry it's so late.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.279
What?

08:11.440 --> 08:13.319
Sorry. Like forty in Russian.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.479
You'll win the court case.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.879
You're a genius.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.479
I'm observant.
I notice what I want to notice.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.519
Thanks.
Thanks a million.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.759
- Finder's reward will do.
- Reward?

08:28.120 --> 08:29.799
10% of what you've saved.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.079
Sure.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.719
You'll end up broadcasting
for inmates, you rat!

08:50.760 --> 08:53.519
Wow! Nice place to live...

08:54.040 --> 08:55.159
I inherited it.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.599
Thanks.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.199
Hold on! Could I please
take a quick look?

09:06.320 --> 09:07.679
I love old houses.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.119
We'll be late.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.279
Refresh my memory:

09:11.360 --> 09:13.999
the tail wags the dog
or the dog wags the tail?

09:14.200 --> 09:14.959
Alright.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.279
You wait.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.119
The dog wags he tail.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.119
Wow! Beautiful stuccos!

09:31.120 --> 09:33.079
I'm renovating them.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.479
- You have experience?
- Some.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.719
I studied art conservation.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.519
- Would you consider selling it?
- Perhaps.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.239
I'd offer a reasonable price.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.639
The price won't be reasonable.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.479
- He has to be around?
- Yes.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.559
He keeps an eye on me.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.959
I'm responsible for your safety.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.719
- It's not necessary.
- Bruno knows better.

09:58.200 --> 09:58.999
Bruno?

09:59.280 --> 10:00.679
A guy I know.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.719
You see the castle from here?

10:04.760 --> 10:05.599
Partly.

10:36.880 --> 10:37.679
Bruno!

11:22.560 --> 11:24.759
I just love your Chinese!

11:25.240 --> 11:25.959
Thank you.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.159
Bruno...

11:30.040 --> 11:32.279
Let's buy a flat in the Old Town.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.399
In Lublin? Why?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.599
It's so awfully cool!

11:36.840 --> 11:37.999
Give me a break.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.199
It's a Disney World
for fast food eaters.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.799
Cool it may be
to have a beer there.

11:44.880 --> 11:48.639
Besides, you have a home
a half-hour drive away.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.319
It's yours.
And I prefer Lublin.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.279
Kitty!

11:54.520 --> 11:56.639
Gosh!

11:58.240 --> 11:59.239
It's so...

11:59.280 --> 12:01.119
I'm in seventh heaven!

12:03.200 --> 12:04.479
I kid you not.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.439
She inherited it.
It's a bargain.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.119
The one who broke jail?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.319
Says who?

12:11.760 --> 12:14.359
- Dime told me.
- Bullshit. I hate him.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.279
I like him.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.719
He spies on me.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.759
Protects you, I'd say.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.359
Got a crush on me.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.479
No! It may not show,
but he's gay.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.479
Gay my ass.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.119
You'd fall in love with the place.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.119
I fell in love long ago.
With you.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.519
Remember?

12:52.800 --> 12:53.679
Stay put.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.519
A swap?

12:59.720 --> 13:00.559
Sorry?

13:00.640 --> 13:02.079
My bag for yours.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.279
Shove it.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.799
Bad girl.
But I won't spank you.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.479
I overreacted then, sorry.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.439
One million euros.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.039
A house in Tuscany.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.599
No worries for the rest
of your life.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.239
I'm a rebel.
Love unrest.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.159
Wrong answer.

13:32.320 --> 13:37.759
Money has a universal appeal because it's
the best tool against this world's misery.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.319
- How did you find me here?
- Patience and open eyes.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.479
Want to know?

13:46.920 --> 13:48.599
Your friend tipped me off.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.559
- Need a hand?
- I'm good.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.999
You like Thai food?
Home-made.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.279
Perfect timing!
I'm starved.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.799
He must be very jealous.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.639
Dime? He obeys Bruno.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.959
Dime? Funny nickname.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.959
It's Jeremi's last name.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.159
I told Bruno you wanted
to sell the apartment.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.399
If it's really a bargain,
he says he'll buy it.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.559
It's not such a bargain.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.839
I need money.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.679
No room for negotiation?

15:39.880 --> 15:43.119
You're not the buyer.
It's your buddy? Man?

15:44.200 --> 15:44.959
Bruno.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.319
What does he do?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.719
Brainwashes the populice.

15:49.960 --> 15:50.959
PopuLICE?

15:52.040 --> 15:54.359
Bruno says so.
He's a spin doctor.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.519
The PR guy who turns morons
into humans.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.959
"The Lublin Voice"
from 1939?

16:10.880 --> 16:12.279
I found it in a wall.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.519
Construction workers
leave their mark that way.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.399
What's this?

16:19.760 --> 16:20.519
May I?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.359
"The Spanish Diary".

16:33.680 --> 16:37.119
September 20, 1936?

16:39.040 --> 16:42.439
Marseilles. I'm boarding a ship
bound to Barcelona.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.959
Likely one way,

16:44.080 --> 16:47.719
as siding with the Republicans
is frowned on in Poland.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.399
Awesome!

17:01.640 --> 17:03.999
Looks like the layout of this place.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.439
Krone? What's that?

17:10.520 --> 17:12.279
My great grandpa's name.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.239
Shoot a video.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.439
There's something in there!

17:52.200 --> 17:53.959
- Bingo!
- What is it?

17:54.000 --> 17:56.599
- A mystery.
- Miss? You said bingo...

18:03.080 --> 18:04.079
It's heavy.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.559
Get it from me.

18:11.080 --> 18:11.919
Careful!

18:12.880 --> 18:13.799
Watch out.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.399
Wow! Incredible!

18:36.880 --> 18:38.559
Wait... Let me see!

18:39.920 --> 18:40.719
A treasure.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.239
Cool, isn't it?

18:47.720 --> 18:48.599
It's gold.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.839
Wait... Show me again.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.079
How's that jailbird of yours doing?

19:03.440 --> 19:05.799
She's no jailbird.
She fixes flats.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.879
Old buildings have their secrets.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.559
She found something in a wall?

19:15.120 --> 19:15.999
Dime told you!

19:16.520 --> 19:18.959
A little bird did.
So what is it?

19:19.440 --> 19:20.799
Her home, her castle.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.319
Well?

19:23.160 --> 19:24.719
Will you buy the flat?

19:26.560 --> 19:27.639
I'll sleep on it.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.439
Wow! Incredible!

19:36.880 --> 19:38.439
Wait... Let me see!

19:39.080 --> 19:40.079
A treasure.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.199
Cool, isn't it?

19:44.280 --> 19:47.159
Crown? A real crown?

19:48.640 --> 19:49.879
Look at the stones.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.239
What's this?

19:51.840 --> 19:53.599
A crown.
Can't you see?

19:54.400 --> 19:55.359
Well, yes.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.559
The real thing?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.199
Sure. A royal crown.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.439
In a wall? In Lublin?

20:03.160 --> 20:05.479
Viki's great grandpa
brought it from Spain.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.359
- It's Spanish then?
- No!

20:07.680 --> 20:10.239
It's supposed to be
Casimir the Great's.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.599
You're kidding me.

20:26.920 --> 20:30.599
- Casimir the Great's crown?
- Brought from Spain.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.959
Her great grandpa
recorded it in his diary.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.559
I'm interested.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.479
In the story or in Viki?

20:39.160 --> 20:42.359
If she's a part of the story...
Get me that diary.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.039
missing crown of Casimir

20:52.760 --> 20:54.079
"Cielito Lindo".

21:39.320 --> 21:40.119
Listen,

21:40.680 --> 21:41.959
there's good news.

21:42.080 --> 21:45.799
Bruno's connections say
we may have the diary published.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.919
The author would be happy.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.399
Put this on.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.959
I have a slogan for us.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.999
We've got one already.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.239
Let's arise from the slumbers...

22:22.960 --> 22:24.159
Let me finish.

22:24.520 --> 22:28.239
Let's arise from the slumbers
to rule from our chambers!

22:31.480 --> 22:34.319
You're the
Polish Socialist-National Party.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.879
We? You're not a socialist?

22:37.160 --> 22:38.319
Non-practicing.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.839
Where's your carrot
for the Nationalists?

22:42.560 --> 22:43.359
Okay...

22:44.120 --> 22:47.919
Let's arise from the slumbers
to rule from our Polish chambers!

22:49.680 --> 22:50.519
No.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.039
The old one will do, trust me.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.079
We'll see in a month's time.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.399
- Please! Don't say "in a month's time".
- Why not?

23:00.480 --> 23:04.679
You can't have a month's width
or height. It must be time.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.159
Like I said.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.599
You'll make
a perfect Joe Nice Guy.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.599
The lack of education will help.
Just like the wife.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.399
- My wife?
- Mine.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.159
Excuse me.

23:29.680 --> 23:30.599
This is Viki.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.519
It's a private reception, invite-only.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.839
And so I invited my friend.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.919
You wanted the diary?

23:39.400 --> 23:42.039
Provided it's to be published, Bruno.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.759
Oh! We're on first-name terms!

23:47.040 --> 23:48.959
I must see what it's worth.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.399
Okay, I'll give it back tomorrow.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.639
And buy the flat the next day.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.119
Non sequitur.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.439
Come along then.
Make yourself at home.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.039
Homey? No. Glitzy!

24:08.440 --> 24:10.199
So nice to see you again.

24:10.560 --> 24:11.359
Hello.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.719
Excuse me.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.279
A selfie, if you don't mind...

24:19.600 --> 24:21.879
Speaker of the House,
Ms. Zwaniecki!

24:24.400 --> 24:25.719
Senator Pyzda!

24:28.320 --> 24:29.839
Chairman Ermine!

24:32.640 --> 24:34.079
Representative Rabble!

24:36.280 --> 24:37.999
And our number one...

24:38.640 --> 24:40.359
Casimir Lower!

24:40.840 --> 24:41.799
Hip hip hurray!

24:42.280 --> 24:46.439
Lower on top!

24:58.520 --> 25:00.639
Don't praise your chickens!

25:01.440 --> 25:05.719
You're all invited for
a traditional Polish dinner.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.039
Let's have a word, Cas.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.679
Don't COUNT your chickens...

25:16.880 --> 25:17.879
You're right.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.399
'Cause it's chicken soup.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.839
May 1 5, 1937. Sierra Morena.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.399
We're at the sanctuary
of Santa Maria de la Cabeza.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.799
Pronounced /kabesa/.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.839
We're at the sanctuary
of Santa Maria de la Cabeza.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.519
Santa Maria de la Cabeza
May 15, 1937

25:44.720 --> 25:49.479
Initially I thought we were here
to fight the fascists

25:50.080 --> 25:57.119
and Moroccan dog soldiers,
who burned, looted and raped.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.279
Unfortunately rape occurs
also on our side.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.479
Comrade Commander!

26:19.040 --> 26:19.839
Help!

26:33.320 --> 26:37.799
- What the fuck are you up to?
- We're preparing a feast.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.639
Help yourself, Comrade Commander.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.279
We've picked the cutest.

26:43.360 --> 26:47.279
- Leave these women alone.
- They're not women. They're nuns.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.919
We're here to defend
the Republic, not to rape.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.839
Why not enjoy both?

26:54.080 --> 26:56.639
They're Franco's whores.

26:57.560 --> 27:00.279
Let them go, right now.
It's an order.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.279
Or else?

27:06.560 --> 27:07.839
I'll shoot you down.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.359
Who's next?

27:34.560 --> 27:38.039
You killed him?
Your comrade?

27:38.400 --> 27:39.839
He wasn't my comrade.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.039
Bury him and we're off.

27:45.720 --> 27:48.279
Damn! To shoot your own men?

27:48.640 --> 27:50.959
They were communists. Listen.

27:51.160 --> 27:55.079
I couldn't believe my eyes: the missing
crown of Casimir the Great!

27:55.160 --> 27:58.719
In college we theorized about
its possible re-emergence,

27:59.040 --> 28:01.319
but nobody ever suggested Spain.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.639
Sir, we are very thankful.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.039
You're welcome.

28:07.480 --> 28:10.119
How could we reward you?

28:14.360 --> 28:15.959
I'd like this crown.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.919
- This crown?
- Please.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.599
Yes, of course.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.079
I'll get it!

28:30.960 --> 28:31.719
Let's go!

29:21.880 --> 29:25.599
How come the crown ended up
in that Spanish backcountry?

29:26.600 --> 29:28.519
There must be an explanation.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.839
From Cracow via Spain to Lublin?

29:32.760 --> 29:36.159
Sounds like some third-rate
travel agency's slogan.

29:45.680 --> 29:46.479
Listen,

29:46.840 --> 29:50.079
in Lower's party there's
a historian and academic.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.159
Find her.

29:58.680 --> 30:03.199
Think about it. Nobody will buy it
and my offer expires on arrival.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.759
No deal, Dime.

30:05.200 --> 30:05.959
Jeremi.

30:07.560 --> 30:11.159
Nobody will buy it, Jeremi,
'cause I'm not selling it.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.239
Rather because it'll be too late.

30:14.360 --> 30:17.079
And doing business with me
is sheer pleasure.

30:19.000 --> 30:19.839
Okay.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.879
Don't mess with me, bitch!
Looking for trouble?

30:29.240 --> 30:30.479
If you insist...

30:42.040 --> 30:44.799
What's Viki going to do
with the crown?

30:45.680 --> 30:47.519
Return it to the owner.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.079
Casimir the Great?

30:51.120 --> 30:51.919
The state.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.839
The people.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.559
Or the family.

30:57.640 --> 31:01.639
We could stage a televised event,

31:03.560 --> 31:07.719
tied in with the elections and
the 700th anniversary of Lublin,

31:07.800 --> 31:09.719
to make everybody happy.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.639
She needs no ballyhoo.

31:13.560 --> 31:16.879
- Because she escaped from jail.
- Here you go again.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.719
We don't need her to be there.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.159
Let her just give
or sell us the crown.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.839
I can talk to her,
but no guarantee.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.679
Am I to raid her
with antiterrorists?

31:30.760 --> 31:31.599
Gee...

31:34.240 --> 31:37.639
Convince her to deposit it...

31:38.800 --> 31:41.119
sell it I mean, without hassle.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.519
You put the crown before the flat?

31:43.600 --> 31:47.639
The crown fits my strategy for
Lower, it'll make him win.

31:48.720 --> 31:52.919
A socio-technical trick.
You'll see, the populice will love it.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.319
How is to know it all?

31:56.200 --> 31:59.279
To get one's drift
like it's your own?

32:01.320 --> 32:02.359
Awfully cool.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.199
Other people are fools, right?

32:07.280 --> 32:09.279
I'll tell you something, kitty.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.799
And read my lips,
because I won't repeat it.

32:13.240 --> 32:16.879
Only 5% of all people are smart.
They set the tone.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.519
The rest just follow.

32:20.200 --> 32:24.239
Statistically I usually deal with
someone of the 95% dimwits,

32:24.360 --> 32:26.039
so I don't give a shit.

32:26.720 --> 32:31.279
And my self-assurance gives me
an initial advantage of several moves.

32:32.880 --> 32:36.719
So you kind of run the globe?
Mr. Know-It-All! A genius.

32:39.080 --> 32:43.199
A genius isn't one who knows it all,
but one who knows sooner.

32:45.720 --> 32:50.039
The historian called back at last.
Her name's Elzbieta Dabrowski.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.839
Kitty, I'm off!

33:00.920 --> 33:02.159
What about lunch?

33:03.120 --> 33:04.199
Well, you see...

33:06.520 --> 33:09.679
Lower, the campaign...
What can I do?

33:11.080 --> 33:13.039
Save it for dinner.
Love you!

33:13.600 --> 33:15.519
Lower Casimir

33:17.160 --> 33:18.399
Speak of the devil.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.559
Good to see you, Bruno.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.719
I had a dream
that I need to tell you.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.039
Really? Go ahead.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.319
In my dream I was a king.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.799
Which means you'll be president.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.159
And king later on.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.959
Being just president sucks.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.719
We need to choose a name for me.

33:42.080 --> 33:47.039
You really mean it? Funny enough,
your name would mimeo the town's.

33:47.200 --> 33:47.959
So?

33:49.080 --> 33:51.279
Okay then, let's add "on-Vistula".

33:51.640 --> 33:52.719
Lower Casimir

33:54.600 --> 33:55.479
Oh shit!

33:57.400 --> 34:00.319
The town has to be renamed.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.879
- What's your middle name?
- Maria.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.599
Maria was a queen.

34:06.400 --> 34:10.599
Then perhaps King Casimir
Augustus Lower.

34:11.320 --> 34:15.039
Yeah, sure. King Casimir Augustus
the Fifth Lower Molar.

34:15.120 --> 34:15.999
Why fifth?

34:17.520 --> 34:19.919
There've been four Casimirs so far.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.479
Fifth's just great.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.359
Because?

34:23.720 --> 34:25.479
We have the Fifth Republic.

34:26.360 --> 34:32.319
Right. A V-sign can stand
for both the Fifth and Victory.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.159
Presidential victory.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.719
Or for Volkswagen.

34:38.360 --> 34:42.159
- That's neither here nor there.
- Sure. We don't want German words.

34:42.240 --> 34:45.239
Okay, whatever.
Just remember: you're an ace.

34:45.640 --> 34:46.719
I do remember.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.959
I'd let them all have it.

34:50.560 --> 34:51.919
You sure will. Relax.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.319
When I'm in the mood.
So long.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.399
What's this king thing?

35:00.440 --> 35:02.319
He's off on a power trip.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.959
I let him ride, it's his soft spot.

35:27.960 --> 35:28.759
Who is it?

35:28.960 --> 35:29.839
Bruno Volta.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.079
Come on in.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.839
It traveled far.

35:38.320 --> 35:39.959
Who would have thought?

35:40.320 --> 35:42.759
In brief, is this credible?

35:43.760 --> 35:45.439
And logistically possible?

35:46.160 --> 35:49.279
Casimir the Great did visit Lublin
a couple of times.

35:49.360 --> 35:52.359
He even got sick once.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.919
But there's no mention of the crown.

35:57.440 --> 36:02.519
I have a theory about how it started,
but the rest is guesswork.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.159
We'll appreciate some details.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.759
Let's start at the beginning.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.639
When Casimir the Great died,

36:12.680 --> 36:14.999
who was elected king?

36:18.400 --> 36:21.839
- You asking me?
- Every Pole knows it. Who?

36:23.640 --> 36:24.479
Louis...

36:25.520 --> 36:26.799
Louis the Hungarian?

36:26.960 --> 36:27.799
Very good!

36:28.560 --> 36:29.559
What dynasty?

36:32.960 --> 36:34.039
Angevin.

36:35.040 --> 36:39.559
Let's get it straight:
we're not here for a history test.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.559
We want your opinion on the fact.

36:43.480 --> 36:44.479
What fact?

36:45.400 --> 36:49.399
Whether it's likely that Casimir's
crown was found in Spain.

36:50.000 --> 36:56.519
His regalia disappeared
right after his death in 1370.

36:57.360 --> 37:03.519
His successor's coronation
took place twelve days later.

37:04.600 --> 37:08.519
Then Louis returned to Hungary
with the regalia.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.559
Regalia?

37:09.760 --> 37:13.879
The crown, scepter, orb,
spurs and the ring.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.599
And then

37:15.880 --> 37:19.319
Janko of Czarnkow,
Deputy Chancellor of the Treasury,

37:19.480 --> 37:24.519
who represented the opposition
detesting the Angevins,

37:25.880 --> 37:29.799
resolved to place a Piast
on the throne. A Pole!

37:31.600 --> 37:33.119
Just like our party.

37:33.400 --> 37:38.799
The opposition backed Wladyslaw
the White of Great Poland.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.119
But they needed what?

37:43.280 --> 37:44.119
The crown?

37:44.400 --> 37:45.319
Very good.

37:45.840 --> 37:49.799
Without the insignia the coronation
and coup d'etat were doomed.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.359
And they basked in the Balaton sun.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.599
By the Danube.
In Visegrad.

37:57.160 --> 37:58.839
So what did Janko do?

37:59.480 --> 38:02.519
Why not call him simply Jan?

38:02.960 --> 38:07.639
Our forefathers used that form.
You mind?

38:08.040 --> 38:09.079
Sounds gay.

38:10.520 --> 38:17.359
Medieval Poland was the only country
in Europe free of pederasty.

38:19.480 --> 38:22.599
Janko came up with a brilliant idea:

38:24.120 --> 38:26.279
the funeral insignia.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.799
- Placed in the tomb?
- The funeral insignia

38:30.480 --> 38:33.199
were a replica
of the coronation insignia

38:33.320 --> 38:34.919
or the other way round.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.399
Cracow, the Royal Crypt,
November 20, 1370

38:37.520 --> 38:41.719
Both sets were made
at the same time, looked identical

38:41.800 --> 38:44.639
and could be used interchangeably.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.839
But they were buried with the king.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.759
Exactly.

39:00.520 --> 39:01.679
What a stench!

39:37.320 --> 39:39.439
The ring and the spurs!

39:48.880 --> 39:49.759
Sorry.

40:06.680 --> 40:07.559
The lid.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.759
Anybody there?
Open up!

40:23.440 --> 40:26.319
The night guard! Open up
in the name of the king!

40:26.400 --> 40:27.679
You know what to do?

40:27.760 --> 40:28.839
Open the door!

40:32.480 --> 40:36.239
Disobedience will be punished.
Open in the name of the king!

40:39.840 --> 40:43.039
To sum it up, the plot failed...

40:43.600 --> 40:46.599
May I ask you to stop smoking?

40:47.360 --> 40:48.599
Quit, you mean?

40:48.880 --> 40:51.199
In this room.
Or I won't go on.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.919
The stolen insignia were never found.

41:00.320 --> 41:05.479
Probably the monk who took them
fled Poland and died

41:06.800 --> 41:08.759
with his secret undisclosed.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.759
- The crown's secure?
- Yes.

41:11.320 --> 41:13.439
I need some time
to lead them astray.

41:13.520 --> 41:16.919
- You want to get caught?
- I'll surrender to the guards.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.519
You take cover, come back
later to get the crown

41:19.640 --> 41:21.759
and give it over to our men
in Great Poland.

41:21.840 --> 41:22.919
Consider it done.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.599
Run. They're after me.

41:32.040 --> 41:33.959
I'm dying...

41:39.040 --> 41:42.679
Thus nobody ever knew
where the regalia were hidden.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.079
Excuse me.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.919
- Kitty?
- I have tickets for "Machia".

41:53.560 --> 41:54.519
What's that?

41:54.880 --> 41:56.639
A play about Machiavelli.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.199
Comedy?

42:00.400 --> 42:02.759
No. But they say it's cool. 9 PM.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.759
I won't make it.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.319
Take your jailbird instead.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.639
Her name's Viki.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.319
That's right, Viki.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.199
Okay, if you won't...

43:32.520 --> 43:33.199
Stop it!

43:33.280 --> 43:35.079
Dime! You fucking thief!

43:35.120 --> 43:36.999
You're not at the theater?

43:39.080 --> 43:41.039
What are you doing?!
Hey!

44:03.000 --> 44:04.639
DIGNITY AND PRIDE

44:06.680 --> 44:07.519
Justyna!

44:09.120 --> 44:10.159
Are you Justyna?

44:11.400 --> 44:13.479
- Where's Cas?
- Meditating.

44:40.480 --> 44:44.119
I thought about what you said.
I even checked the legal basis.

44:44.240 --> 44:46.279
I'm meditating on the Passion.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.199
What the fuck is your problem?

44:52.320 --> 44:55.879
There's something poignant
about the crucifix.

44:57.040 --> 44:57.999
Well, yes.

44:59.760 --> 45:02.559
But if the Romans
hadn't crucified people,

45:03.760 --> 45:09.399
if He had died on the stake,
not on the cross,

45:09.480 --> 45:12.279
what symbol would we have?
The urn?

45:13.280 --> 45:14.079
True.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.319
Not much of a logo.

45:17.200 --> 45:20.239
Anyways... I've checked
with the legal office.

45:21.200 --> 45:25.839
Under the new constitution
it's possible to restore the monarchy

45:25.920 --> 45:27.359
through a referendum.

45:27.440 --> 45:28.439
Fantastic!

45:28.480 --> 45:33.959
Or it can be decided by the National
Assembly with a 2/3 majority vote.

45:34.560 --> 45:35.399
Or...

45:36.200 --> 45:37.159
Read my lips...

45:38.080 --> 45:39.959
By presidential decree.

45:42.280 --> 45:45.079
The last one seems the fastest.

45:46.080 --> 45:48.479
- But there's one condition.
- Well?

45:48.840 --> 45:50.719
You must become president.

45:50.800 --> 45:52.519
Yeah, sure.

45:52.800 --> 45:56.159
But I'd opt for a transitory period:

45:56.680 --> 45:59.359
the last president
would become regent.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.839
Here's what I suggest.

46:03.160 --> 46:04.839
That recovered crown...

46:05.600 --> 46:07.439
can't leave this country.

46:08.320 --> 46:10.279
We'll return it to the people.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.759
You'll see to it.
As a patriot.

46:13.800 --> 46:17.319
You'll give it back - as the last
descendant of the Piasts.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.599
Piasts? Why not the Jagiellonians?

46:19.960 --> 46:23.519
We'll trace you back to both.
Get the fuck up.

46:28.680 --> 46:33.319
This chapel was founded by
Casimir the Great in the 1300s.

46:33.760 --> 46:36.519
Look, medieval graffiti.

46:38.160 --> 46:41.279
Wladyslaw Jagiello is... an asshole?

46:42.160 --> 46:43.079
How so?

46:43.560 --> 46:49.079
Your royal biography will make
Jagiello's a joke, I promise.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.319
Will they buy it?

46:52.280 --> 46:55.319
Repeat a lie a thousand times
and it becomes the truth.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.599
But remember: presidency first.

47:12.640 --> 47:13.519
Good morning.

47:16.720 --> 47:18.279
- Hi.
- Hi, Viki.

47:18.640 --> 47:20.479
- How are you today?
- Hello.

47:20.560 --> 47:22.719
- Anybody in the swimming pool?
- Nobody.

47:22.840 --> 47:23.719
Awesome!

47:36.960 --> 47:39.399
That's outrageous.
To hit a woman!

47:42.960 --> 47:44.959
I'll fix the son of a bitch.

47:46.560 --> 47:49.639
- You must get the crown back!
- Go ahead, persuade them.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.399
Let them pay at least.

47:51.560 --> 47:53.519
I want the crown, not money.

47:53.720 --> 47:55.159
And a plastic surgeon.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.159
- You were to ask around.
- I know one.

47:58.440 --> 48:01.879
I said a friend needed a make-over.

48:02.680 --> 48:06.479
He said okay. Even though he's
booked up until next year.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.639
Just a slight correction.

48:14.280 --> 48:17.559
- Did you really escape from prison?
- From jail.

48:17.960 --> 48:20.639
I was naive, got involved
in art theft.

48:20.720 --> 48:23.839
By returning the crown
I'll clean up my record.

48:30.360 --> 48:31.639
You sly bitch!

48:33.200 --> 48:35.279
At last we can talk freely.

48:38.880 --> 48:41.199
They're both sick,
Bruno and Dime.

48:41.720 --> 48:44.439
One's sickly jealous,
the other sickly in love.

48:44.520 --> 48:48.999
I keep wondering how come
you're with someone like Bruno.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.359
He was so...

48:52.640 --> 48:53.519
So old?

48:55.800 --> 48:56.759
Amusing.

49:00.080 --> 49:02.319
I met him two years ago in Verona.

49:02.880 --> 49:04.919
I was offered a chef job there.

49:05.280 --> 49:08.559
He begged me to return
and start my own business.

49:09.960 --> 49:13.079
Said a chef could be fired,
an owner couldn't.

49:15.840 --> 49:16.919
I fell in love.

49:19.080 --> 49:21.439
He promised to help,
but never did.

49:23.680 --> 49:27.159
I couldn't depend on anybody,
least of all on a guy.

49:30.560 --> 49:37.199
Someday you'll open a restaurant
and I'll decorate it for you.

49:55.440 --> 49:59.279
It's no shit, she really wants
to turn it over to the state.

50:00.520 --> 50:02.039
To simply give it back?

50:02.480 --> 50:03.799
She's a simple girl.

50:06.680 --> 50:07.479
For free?

50:07.840 --> 50:11.399
To make up
for what landed her in jail.

50:19.360 --> 50:22.319
I'd rather you broke up
with that jailbird.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.879
I don't want any scandal
before the elections.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.959
Is that why you had Dime
beat her up?

50:30.920 --> 50:31.719
Pardon?

50:31.880 --> 50:34.039
He hit her and stole the crown.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.959
- You're nuts!
- You claim it's not true...

50:39.080 --> 50:40.399
I saw you hide it.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.119
Look, kitty.

50:42.560 --> 50:43.639
The deal was

50:44.600 --> 50:47.759
you mind your business,
I mind mine.

51:02.840 --> 51:07.559
Following the epic charge
of Polish cavalry at Somosierra Pass

51:07.640 --> 51:12.199
Napoleon wants to reward the Poles
with something precious,

51:12.280 --> 51:19.919
rightfully claimed as their own:
the missing crown of Casimir the Great.

51:20.800 --> 51:26.319
Four days after the battle
Commander Krasinski

51:26.560 --> 51:31.359
summons three trustworthy officers.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.159
My dear rascals!

51:36.240 --> 51:39.079
Madrid, Col. Krasinski's quarter,
December 4, 1808

51:40.040 --> 51:44.039
We've won the shortest and the
cheapest battle of the campaign.

51:44.240 --> 51:47.519
We opened the door to Madrid
in eight minutes!

51:48.920 --> 51:50.799
'Cause Polish blood is cheap.

51:50.880 --> 51:53.679
France will always remember us.

51:54.160 --> 51:56.959
'Cause they keep saying
"as drunk as a Pole".

51:59.760 --> 52:05.279
Infantry would've fought for weeks,
with lots of bloodshed.

52:05.920 --> 52:07.719
The Emperor is ecstatic.

52:09.760 --> 52:12.559
But they've written
it was a French charge.

52:12.920 --> 52:14.279
French AND Polish.

52:14.880 --> 52:18.559
But you know and people know
it was a Polish charge!

52:18.840 --> 52:20.559
Under Kozietulski.

52:21.080 --> 52:25.719
The Emperor called us the bravest
of the brave. This has to suffice.

52:26.600 --> 52:27.479
As usual.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.559
Who will remember it in the future?

52:31.600 --> 52:37.839
In any case, the Emperor is willing
to give us something. Give back.

52:38.240 --> 52:43.839
"It sat 200 years in St. Denis
treasury, but I think it's yours" -

52:43.960 --> 52:45.719
that's what he said!

52:55.400 --> 52:59.719
- The missing crown of Casimir the Great.
- You sound like an expert!

52:59.840 --> 53:01.639
How did it end up in France?

53:02.800 --> 53:04.239
He didn't say that.

53:04.320 --> 53:05.119
Anyways...

53:05.560 --> 53:07.199
I have a mission for you.

53:07.320 --> 53:14.079
Early tomorrow I want you on your
way to Poland with this load.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.439
To Warsaw?

53:15.600 --> 53:17.279
Why not. But via Cracow.

53:17.640 --> 53:20.199
Because when we finally
attack Russia...

53:20.760 --> 53:22.679
Attack Russia? When?

53:23.320 --> 53:24.679
When time is ripe.

53:25.280 --> 53:30.399
And then Napoleon, on his way
to Moscow, will stop in Cracow

53:30.520 --> 53:32.919
to be crowned King of Poland.

53:33.480 --> 53:37.279
I want the crown of the last Piast
waiting for him there.

53:41.400 --> 53:46.519
"As drunk as a Pole" not because
only Poles drink. The French drink too.

53:46.680 --> 53:50.359
But the next day they're unsteady
in the saddle, while we,

53:50.440 --> 53:54.639
even hung over, charge uphill,
seizing the pass and sixteen cannons.

53:54.720 --> 53:56.639
That's why he told his troops:

53:56.720 --> 53:59.559
if you must drink,
get as drunk as a Pole.

54:01.680 --> 54:04.239
Long live the Emperor!

54:05.960 --> 54:08.759
If they took the crown to Cracow,

54:09.600 --> 54:11.479
how did it reappear in Spain?

54:12.320 --> 54:14.279
It never made it to Cracow.

54:14.640 --> 54:15.439
No?

54:15.920 --> 54:16.679
Why?

54:16.960 --> 54:19.559
Lubienski's diary says nothing,

54:19.840 --> 54:24.599
but his companion's letters,
published forty years later,

54:24.680 --> 54:26.719
explain what happened.

54:27.280 --> 54:28.719
Venta Quemada
December 6, 1808

54:28.800 --> 54:32.039
You ask why the three of us
were selected for the mission.

54:32.120 --> 54:35.199
It's because we were
the luckiest of them all.

54:37.120 --> 54:41.039
Until we had to face up to
a bunch of Spanish guerrilleros.

55:12.960 --> 55:14.439
All right, Fernando?

55:14.960 --> 55:15.839
Damn!

55:17.280 --> 55:18.279
Catholic?

55:19.640 --> 55:20.799
You're not French?

55:21.880 --> 55:22.839
I'm Polish.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.359
These suckers are lucky.

55:27.560 --> 55:28.639
They're Polish.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.239
Holy cats!

55:42.040 --> 55:43.719
We are the lucky ones!

55:44.560 --> 55:45.679
Look at this.

55:46.320 --> 55:47.479
A treasure!

55:49.600 --> 55:50.599
Poles...

55:51.520 --> 55:53.759
What brought you all the way here?

55:54.040 --> 55:55.759
You want to fight with us?

55:57.000 --> 55:59.119
Why? We've done you no harm.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.599
You have your own country.

56:03.080 --> 56:04.039
I don't.

56:07.560 --> 56:09.159
As your poet said:

56:10.040 --> 56:12.519
Vivat Polonus,
unus defensor Mariae!

56:13.520 --> 56:16.439
Long live the Pole,
the only defender of Mary.

56:17.040 --> 56:17.839
Exactly.

56:18.320 --> 56:20.479
Spared in exchange for the booty.

56:21.040 --> 56:23.799
Like in "Forefathers".
You know the plot?

56:25.440 --> 56:29.319
More than one. In this country
everybody's plotting.

56:30.640 --> 56:32.959
Just don't pipe up like this
at a rally.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.959
Mickiewicz depicts a similar situation.

56:36.800 --> 56:40.239
Spaniards spare our men
seeing a holy medal.

56:40.760 --> 56:44.279
- How did Napoleon get our crown?
- Does it matter now?

56:44.360 --> 56:47.399
This crown will be
the cornerstone of your campaign.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.159
Okay, but I'm hungry.

56:49.800 --> 56:50.759
Excuse me.

56:50.960 --> 56:52.959
Could I see your bill of fare?

56:53.200 --> 56:54.199
My underwear?

56:54.680 --> 56:55.799
The menu, please.

56:57.200 --> 56:58.159
No problem.

56:58.840 --> 57:01.679
- Use regular language.
- "Menu" is French.

57:01.840 --> 57:04.959
I believe in our mother tongue,
our vocabulary.

57:05.960 --> 57:07.319
Like allmouth.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.639
- What?
- It's fish. Monkfish.

57:52.360 --> 57:53.439
What the heck...

57:56.600 --> 57:58.039
Looking for something?

57:58.920 --> 58:01.599
Bruno sent me.
Should you need anything.

58:02.120 --> 58:02.959
From you?

58:03.520 --> 58:04.519
Like what?

58:05.840 --> 58:07.239
I'm Jack of all trades.

58:07.360 --> 58:08.879
Crown theft included.

58:09.520 --> 58:11.959
Stay away from that jailbird.

58:12.280 --> 58:15.799
- She'd sell you for a song.
- You judge by yourself?

58:16.720 --> 58:18.239
I know the likes of her.

58:18.320 --> 58:21.279
- You mustn't come in here.
- I'm in the doorway.

58:21.680 --> 58:22.519
Go away.

58:30.440 --> 58:31.479
Remember, Cas.

58:32.800 --> 58:35.999
Success is 55% your body language
and looks,

58:36.600 --> 58:39.599
38% - the way you talk
and your voice timbre,

58:39.720 --> 58:43.479
and only 7% - your speech content.
So it's not that bad.

58:45.160 --> 58:48.279
Then facial expression of the face
matters, right?

58:48.760 --> 58:51.319
"Facial" is the same
as "of the face".

58:51.520 --> 58:52.399
Oh, yeah?

58:52.880 --> 58:55.559
Does "facial expression of the ass"
sound okay?

58:55.640 --> 58:56.959
- It doesn't?
- No.

58:58.040 --> 59:03.239
And remember, when you're about
to say something important or moving,

59:03.720 --> 59:05.679
look straight into the camera.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.959
Can I say: "The future no longer
looks the way it used to"?

59:13.360 --> 59:14.319
Don't say that.

59:20.920 --> 59:23.599
Hi! Got your money transfer, thanks.

59:23.680 --> 59:25.439
Good to see you, guys!

59:26.240 --> 59:28.439
Let me show you around my kingdom.

59:28.520 --> 59:29.999
No need to introduce...

59:30.080 --> 59:34.319
Our TV has brought good luck
to two presidents.

59:34.880 --> 59:36.919
I'm in the right place then.

59:37.840 --> 59:39.079
Please follow me.

59:45.520 --> 59:46.439
Excuse me.

59:47.200 --> 59:52.679
I need your advice. Investors complain
that the return on capital is too slow.

59:53.080 --> 59:57.839
That my TV isn't growing enough.
I must convince them they're wrong.

59:58.800 --> 1:00:00.559
Things like that take time.

1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:03.959
Tell them about
the Sydney Opera House.

1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:09.719
Apparently a failure - economically and
logistically. Completed 13 years late.

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:14.839
But today, when the name comes up,
everybody goes: what a success!

1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:18.799
- Your TV won't be any different.
- You think so? Good.

1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:23.039
We'll air a docu on the Sydney
Opera House. Thanks.

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:26.039
Go ahead.

1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:41.959
Can't you dress up for work?

1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:46.359
White shirt, jacket and tie?

1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:52.519
It's not just yourself you represent.

1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:54.399
Who else?

1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:57.319
This station. Your employer.

1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:01.959
I thought I was just
a supplement to the camera.

1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:07.079
Fuck you!

1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:09.359
Sporting our logo on your balls?!

1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:10.879
My balls?

1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:14.959
When you yell like this,
they're up here.

1:01:24.040 --> 1:01:24.959
Keep it!

1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:26.759
For being ballsy.

1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:33.799
How come that six months ago
nobody had heard of you

1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:37.639
and you end up with a 58%
chance of becoming president?

1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:40.719
I'm unpredictable and steadfast.

1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:44.559
Just like my electorate.
Like all Polish people.

1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:46.279
You have a program?

1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:49.319
I'm not a washing machine.

1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:51.479
I believe in a vision.

1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:55.159
- I'd like to go back to the roots.
- The Solidarity movement?

1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:58.319
Further back. The days following
the introduction of...

1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:00.439
- Martial law?
- Christianity.

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:01.759
Oh...

1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:05.479
- That's way back...
- The Piast dynasty.

1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:09.079
I think the abolition of monarchy
was a mistake.

1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:11.079
King Mieszko I...

1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:15.319
Prince Mieszko I. The first Polish
king was Boleslaw Chrobry.

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:18.519
- The future will show.
- Brush up on your history.

1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:19.919
It's elementary school.

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.359
Anyways, I don't see why
we can't be a monarchy.

1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:27.119
- Like Great Britain.
- He's going off-script.

1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:29.279
The British crown is hereditary.

1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:32.759
The Piasts have descendants, too.

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:38.079
You'll track them down?
Why would we need a king?

1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:41.559
Kings personify the most sublime.

1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:43.559
God, honor, fatherland.

1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:48.159
We should revive and continue
the Piast crusades to the East.

1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:50.839
To the West.
The Jagiellonians went east.

1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:54.079
West, east...
Please, stop interrupting me.

1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:56.199
It's not fair.

1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.039
A king is God-anointed.
It gives him different prerogatives.

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:02.439
Namely?

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:04.759
The highest moral competence.

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:09.959
In the restored monarchy
the king deserves more power.

1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:11.799
I deserve a drink.

1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:16.799
More than the government, the
parliament? Absolute power?

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:23.199
As our history shows, a weak monarchy
brought about the state's decline.

1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:26.759
The new constitution
will allow the president to restate...

1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:29.199
reinstate the monarchy.

1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:32.239
Bruno says the public loves
idiots, so he has a chance.

1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:34.279
So, as president you'll issue

1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:38.079
that decree and as king
you'll seek absolute power.

1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:39.959
Maybe yes, maybe no.

1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:44.919
"Maybe" So typical of that
National-Socialist Party of yours.

1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.559
- Socialist-National!
- It's the same.

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:54.039
It sure isn't! We only want to give
Polish people their due.

1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:55.399
Like what?

1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:58.199
You want houses to change hands?

1:03:58.320 --> 1:04:01.599
We don't question Jewish property,

1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:04.919
- we only defend Polish claims.
- Fuck!

1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:06.959
What's wrong?

1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:09.559
Kill me, or I'll kill him.

1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:14.439
Only a very cruel heart
could take you seriously.

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:20.239
Your unfounded generalizations of
a derogatory nature defy my intellect.

1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:24.079
Well, wasn't that something?

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:28.679
We hosted a presidential candidate,
perhaps our future king,

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:33.399
Casimir Lower of the National-Socialist
Party "Dignity & Pride".

1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:39.159
- Socialist-National, I insist.
- National-Socialist, read your banner.

1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:45.319
- How did I do?
- Ambiguously.

1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:47.639
Great. I looked into the camera.

1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:50.599
Did he really give
the boy his Rolex?

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:00.679
See that bearded man in green?

1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:06.119
It's Jan Laski. Active in
Polish-Lithuanian negotiations,

1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:09.479
but wasn't there when
the Union Act was signed.

1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:15.079
- Then why did Matejko paint him?
- Laski died nine years before.

1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:21.479
But the artist recognized his merits
and painted him for posterity.

1:05:22.280 --> 1:05:24.239
Is it fair to distort history?

1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:26.879
For a good cause... Why not?

1:05:27.800 --> 1:05:28.559
Really?

1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:32.159
I think I've found the missing link
to the puzzle.

1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:39.599
But we must go 234 years back,
to the times of Henry of Valois.

1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:43.959
That French king of Poland
who fled to France.

1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:49.279
- Having emptied the treasury.
- We were sacked at every opportunity.

1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:52.039
Cracow, King's chambers
June 18, 1574

1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:57.439
They'd lock him up for the night
to prevent his flight.

1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:04.199
- Got the keys?
- Yeah.

1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:36.879
Sire, this damn fortress is locked
and bolted.

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:39.799
The Polacks fear that
Your Majesty will escape.

1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:44.079
Sire, hurry up! They forgot
about the kitchen doors.

1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:47.679
This mess will get them into
trouble someday. Let's go!

1:06:48.360 --> 1:06:49.439
Just a moment.

1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:54.279
I'm not going to leave this behind.

1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:57.079
The money France paid...

1:06:57.560 --> 1:06:59.599
Not France. My mother!

1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:03.479
She paid a fortune for my election.

1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:07.919
What I was to spend here,
I'll spend much better in Paris!

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.639
To the kitchen, this way!

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.679
You really need this, Sire?
Your bags are heavy.

1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:29.159
We don't have it in France yet.

1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:34.599
You've no idea how useful it is.

1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:36.999
A Polish invention.

1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:46.399
We've lost our dear de Larchant!

1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:49.679
Because of some stupid well!

1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:51.919
Wait, there's something down there!

1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:56.719
Leave it, Sire. Time's pressing.

1:07:56.960 --> 1:07:58.239
Easy does it.

1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:00.839
It looks like a royal crown.

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:06.719
I already have one,
but another won't hurt.

1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:08.639
There's one more in France!

1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:14.639
Are you trying to say that all that
sat a hundred years in a wall?

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:21.479
A floor. In an old,
bricked-over well, to be exact.

1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:24.799
And not a hundred,
but 204 years.

1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:29.079
The crown was stolen
and hidden

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:34.679
under the castle's kitchen floor
in November 1370.

1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:37.839
- Who did it? That monk?
- Apparently.

1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:40.079
204 years later

1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:44.359
Henry of Valois chances upon it
while fleeing Poland.

1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:51.559
234 years later it's discovered
by our cavalry men. In 1808.

1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:54.759
But it falls into Spanish
hands again.

1:08:55.560 --> 1:09:04.879
131 years later, in 1939, the crown
travels from Spain to Lublin.

1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:11.919
Where it stays another 78 years
until this marathon across centuries

1:09:11.960 --> 1:09:16.399
ends on the 700th anniversary
of Lublin.

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:24.199
All right...
The story hangs together.

1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:29.119
Last question.

1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:34.079
Is this crown the real thing?

1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:37.399
Just a second...

1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:40.799
Here you go.

1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:45.999
The best expert I know of.

1:09:55.520 --> 1:09:59.039
- Hi! How are you?
- What's up, Bruno?

1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:12.319
Take your time, kitty. Meanwhile
we'll hold a short conference.

1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:17.879
Professor Dabrowska sent us.

1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:20.959
Excuse me.

1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:28.839
CLOSED

1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:35.879
Copper-silver alloy, gold-plated.

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:41.319
Emeralds, sapphires and crystals.

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:47.279
Not gold and diamonds? Bummer.
What's it worth?

1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:53.279
For the jeweler - 100-150,000.

1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:58.879
But it's like appraising a Rembrandt
by the value of the paint used.

1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:02.399
Have you heard of the Millennium
treasure at Sroda Slaska?

1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:08.599
Charles of Luxembourg's regalia.
Early 1300s.

1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:10.919
How do you know that?

1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:13.359
From the net. I'm interested.

1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:15.719
You can read about it...

1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:18.959
Here you are.

1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:21.919
CODEWORD "CROWN"

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.959
Has eagle-shaped pendants
complete with a cameo.

1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:28.479
- Must be worth several million bucks.
- A hundred.

1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:31.719
Wow!

1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:39.119
To finance war campaigns Charles IV
pawned his regalia with Moses.

1:11:39.800 --> 1:11:40.479
Who?

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:42.799
A fabulously rich Jew from Sielce.

1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:49.759
When the plague broke out, Moses
fled, burying the treasure in his cellar.

1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:56.039
650 years later it was dug out
by Polish construction workers.

1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:00.159
Very well then.

1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:02.159
How much can this be worth?

1:12:07.880 --> 1:12:09.959
I think that at least...

1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:15.999
10-12 million euros.

1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:20.279
I see...

1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:29.279
Thank you so much.

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.519
Twelve million...

1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:46.079
Dime!

1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:48.879
Dime! The bike!

1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:55.959
The bike!

1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:07.319
What the fuck?

1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:13.119
Nobody knew we'd be here.
Nobody!

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:23.479
You tipped them off.

1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:28.079
Whom? Are you crazy?
Ouch! It hurts!

1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:35.719
I repeat: did she do it?

1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:38.839
I saw three funny guys.

1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:40.559
She sent them, right?

1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:43.119
Stop it!

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:49.759
Don't insult my intelligence.

1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:53.399
I'll do you no harm,
just say if it's her.

1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:04.279
She promised to help me
in exchange.

1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:05.959
With what?

1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:08.079
To start a restaurant.

1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:12.919
Restaurant!
Fuck! For 12 million euros?!

1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:19.159
Go on.

1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:23.799
Tomorrow morning
she'll take it to Cracow.

1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:25.599
- What time?
- 9:05.

1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:39.159
I really don't know.

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:40.959
Cas said okay.

1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:44.559
- I don't know.
- Now you do know.

1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:46.159
Give me all there is.

1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:49.759
- One million euros?
- I'll drop it off myself.

1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:52.359
I can't decide on my own.

1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:55.719
I have Lower's consent.

1:14:58.400 --> 1:14:59.239
Lower?

1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:02.559
He's not the one to decide.

1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:04.279
No? Who then?

1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:06.559
The chairman.

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:12.559
Ripoff.

1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:15.079
Volta.

1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:17.199
- It's about...
- I know.

1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:20.119
- What's your name again?
- Tyczynski.

1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:26.519
- Seemed to be different.
- I have two.

1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:28.439
You'll get that million.

1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:31.599
Deposit it with my accountant
in Warsaw tomorrow.

1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:34.959
- You can bank on me.
- Not until it's in the bank.

1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:48.599
Is Mr. Bruno Vol - TA here?

1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:50.439
The VOL is stressed.

1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:54.159
Shall we come back later?

1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:58.639
The first syllable of my name
is stressed, not me.

1:15:58.720 --> 1:15:59.799
Never mind.

1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:02.319
- Give it...
- May I see your ID?

1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:04.439
- You know me.
- It's required.

1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:31.999
- You'll really pay her this much?
- Not a fucking penny.

1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:38.319
But the bait must be substantial,
the money real and within reach.

1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:42.079
When money's real, fish bite.

1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:48.959
She'll donate the crown to the
electoral committee of the party.

1:16:53.120 --> 1:16:55.679
Remember: all we do is legal.

1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:09.319
We could easily cut this chain
and get the crown.

1:17:10.040 --> 1:17:12.239
But I have a different suggestion.

1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:24.879
Donate the crown to the Socialist-
National Party "Dignity & Pride".

1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:26.319
Sign

1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:30.079
and the million is yours.

1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:35.159
This doesn't say I'm getting paid.

1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:40.639
Better for you.
No need to report, no tax...

1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:42.079
Hello!

1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:18.999
You know what, kitty?

1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:23.359
There's no mention of money,
so let's leave it at that.

1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:30.159
Funny. Someone I know once heard
the same and she lost everything.

1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:38.279
Good morning.

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:42.599
My name is Mariola.
I'll attend to you during this trip.

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:44.079
Coffee? Tea?

1:18:44.280 --> 1:18:45.199
No, thank you.

1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:47.079
Speak for yourself.

1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:55.919
Dime! The suitcase!

1:18:57.320 --> 1:18:59.679
Enough, young lady.
Violence never...

1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:11.679
The suitcase!

1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:27.839
Fuck!

1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:29.159
Damn!

1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:39.799
One million down the drain.

1:19:40.760 --> 1:19:44.159
- Down the fucking road.
- Aren't you observant!

1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:47.079
It's a fucking scheme!

1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:54.639
Wait!

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:22.679
Thanks for all that was good.
Kitty.

1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:33.239
What harm did I do you?

1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:37.559
What harm did I do you?
You uneducated, stuck-up bitch?!

1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:52.239
- How could she?
- 'Cause you treated her like an object.

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:56.119
You're what? Faggot? Feminist?
Her spokesman?

1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:59.519
I got the crown for free.
It's you who got screwed.

1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:00.599
Me?

1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:03.239
To risk a million for a signature?

1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:08.839
She recorded
finding the crown in the wall.

1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:14.759
As to the risk,
I risked my fucking fee!

1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:23.399
Okay.

1:21:23.960 --> 1:21:26.799
Once we win the elections,
we'll have a replica made.

1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:30.919
The real crown should sell for
ten million euros and we're good.

1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:34.599
Let's get cracking.

1:21:45.680 --> 1:21:46.719
No, don't!

1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:51.479
Say you've recovered it

1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:55.599
and as president you'll return it
to the people. Okay?

1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:57.279
All right, whatever...

1:21:57.800 --> 1:22:01.559
Remember: presidency first.
Otherwise it won't work out.

1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:28.359
The last Polish king
died 218 years ago.

1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:31.959
We've waited long enough
and the time has come.

1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:35.719
Long live the new king!
King Casimir V.

1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:40.039
Take off that coat and say
what you were to say.

1:22:40.440 --> 1:22:42.399
I wanted a clever shortcut.

1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:46.599
Clever?! I said presidency first.
Take that crown off!

1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:47.719
No!

1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:51.559
- This crown...
- We'll do a re-run.

1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:55.159
belonged to my great predecessor,
Casimir like myself.

1:22:56.480 --> 1:22:57.679
With God's help

1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:01.719
I blocked its sale
and shipping abroad.

1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:04.839
I promise the Polish people...

1:23:05.400 --> 1:23:07.399
Who the fuck will buy it?

1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:09.959
Any comments?

1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:14.519
I'm from Cracow and know that
the crown's sitting in the tomb.

1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:16.279
How do you mean?

1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:20.239
When they dug out the regalia
in the 19th century

1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:21.719
they made a replica.

1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:24.999
It's on display in the castle.

1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:29.279
- Give it to me.
- No!

1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:32.079
Come on!

1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:38.279
There's an inscription.

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:43.199
Made in China?

1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:46.159
Stan wants to see you.

1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:48.199
Who the fuck is Stan?

1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:51.119
Our treasurer. It's about
the money entrusted to you.

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:53.519
Look what you've done!

1:23:55.400 --> 1:23:57.159
Get me Professor Dabrowska!

1:23:58.120 --> 1:23:59.239
She'll explain.

1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:01.879
On camera, I suggest.

1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:14.119
Here we are.

1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:15.679
Hello.

1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:17.799
You wanted to see me.

1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:20.839
You? Who are you?

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:23.679
Professor Dabrowska.

1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:25.639
Who? Oh, fuck!

1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.119
- Pardon me?
- May I see your ID?

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:32.639
No problem.

1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:43.039
The other was on Wikipedia,
I saw her photo.

1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:44.599
There's this one now.

1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:49.959
So you can insert a fake,
then delete it?

1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:52.359
The net can be tricky.

1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:56.679
Some things did happen.

1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:00.839
There was a theft attempt,
but it failed.

1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:07.159
Janko sneaked into the crypt,
unaware of being followed.

1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:09.599
And so, the regalia were saved.

1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:11.039
How's that?!

1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:13.719
He was caught.
And banished.

1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:16.399
But Henry of Valois got that crown!

1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:19.399
He couldn't have!

1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:24.679
The crown sat in the crypt,
buried 200 years before.

1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:28.319
So the whole story
is a fake.

1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:33.959
Although some of our cavalry
did rape nuns.

1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:36.199
Impossible.

1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:38.399
One question.

1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:40.439
About our party funds...

1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:41.959
Not now!

1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:47.119
It's urgent. Without that money
our campaign is doomed.

1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:51.439
Then I could lose
in spite of the backing?

1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:55.079
Bruno, say something!

1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:13.799
You're here to see me?

1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:15.999
The door wasn't locked?

1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:17.439
No, it wasn't.

1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:20.519
We came to see Viki Kowalski.

1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:25.439
She did the ceiling last week.

1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:28.319
Victoria? The arts student.

1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:31.759
She lived here
while I was abroad.

1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:37.679
She renovated the stuccos.
But her last name's Zawistowski.

1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:43.159
- Zawistowski?
- Yes.

1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:44.999
You know where she's now?

1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:48.519
I have her phone number.

1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:54.439
Zawistowski?
Could be her daughter?

1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:57.039
It's been many years... Who knows.

1:26:57.320 --> 1:27:01.519
Funny, they plant a stolen painting
in your lady's car and you do nothing.

1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:06.039
I didn't realize the cops knew
and would nab her at the border.

1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:10.039
Every tragedy stems from stupidity.

1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:12.119
Your own bright idea?

1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:13.239
A quote.

1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:15.239
Tell me more.

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:21.199
Well?

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.759
Bruno's in pieces, hanging outside
"your" apartment.

1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:30.119
Okay, Viki, time's running out.

1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:34.959
I just love this job!

1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:39.319
Tea?

1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:42.759
- Cookies?
- Yes, please!

1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:45.319
I'll end up fat.

1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:47.599
I can't believe I did it.

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.919
- Did what?
- Walked out on Bruno.

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:51.639
Better late than later.

1:27:57.160 --> 1:27:57.999
Excuse me.

1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:00.039
There are three of us.

1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:02.039
A practical joke.

1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:10.079
Eat up the cookies
and off we go.

1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:14.959
I've got to return the keys
before Volta shows up.

1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:16.039
Ready?

1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:21.479
No, just do it.

1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:28.759
- There's been no prison break here.
- There was one last week.

1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:31.519
Sirens went off, guards popped out...

1:28:31.720 --> 1:28:32.519
With dogs.

1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:36.759
A new guard
set them off by mistake.

1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:39.479
The others played it by the book.

1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:41.479
But it was a false alarm.

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:55.599
Then Viki Zawistowski
has never been here.

1:28:55.920 --> 1:28:58.639
This kind of information
is confidential.

1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:07.079
And Marta?

1:29:07.560 --> 1:29:10.079
- Marta Zawistowski?
- Confidential again.

1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:21.519
Marta has just been released.

1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:25.439
I know.

1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:41.559
Hi, Bruno! Long time...

1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:48.919
Kitty?

1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:54.399
Kitty waited in the cage for
the help you promised... In vain.

1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:58.399
And so is no longer your kitty.
How goes it?

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:04.079
How was I to know?
Remember, in Croatia I said...

1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:05.599
Why on earth...

1:30:07.480 --> 1:30:08.239
Kitty?

1:30:08.320 --> 1:30:10.319
I've heard you're up the creek.

1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:13.599
Private life? Business? Huh?

1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:17.879
Then we're even.

1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:25.239
Too late for a volt, Mr. Volta.

1:30:36.520 --> 1:30:38.959
But why, after all this time?

1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:42.959
Father's death hurts less
than the loss of your patrimony.

1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:44.399
Shakespeare?

1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:46.799
Niccolo Machiavelli.

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:48.639
You're fucking well-read.

1:30:49.720 --> 1:30:52.839
I've seen that play, "Machia".

1:30:54.920 --> 1:30:56.559
Marta wasn't my fault.

1:30:57.360 --> 1:31:00.439
You let your woman
carry funny stuff?

1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:06.639
It was a summer fling, week-long.
Why should it haunt me till now?

1:31:15.640 --> 1:31:17.279
Photoshopped. Damn!

1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:21.599
CLASS OF 2007

1:31:23.640 --> 1:31:25.039
They'd met before?

1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:32.479
Aren't you both something?

1:31:33.360 --> 1:31:36.119
And Xavery.
He inserted the links.

1:31:36.280 --> 1:31:39.159
And deleted them,
which was more important.

1:31:40.280 --> 1:31:43.999
- Xavery's always helped you.
- That's what cousins are for.

1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:48.399
So where would you like
to go, Mom?

1:31:48.960 --> 1:31:50.679
Somewhere I've never been.

1:31:53.360 --> 1:31:54.399
The new airport!

1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:10.119
Three tickets for the next flight to...

1:32:11.200 --> 1:32:11.999
To?

1:32:13.480 --> 1:32:14.879
Someplace cool.

1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:16.919
You mean?

1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:18.319
Sunny.

1:32:19.400 --> 1:32:20.719
Cool and sunny?

1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:24.439
How about...

1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:31.559
What?

1:32:31.640 --> 1:32:34.439
I've just recalled.
The print on her back.

1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:37.559
"Revenge for the wrong done" -
in Japanese.

1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:47.319
Should've studied history, moron!

1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:55.199
It can't be true.

1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:57.999
No fucking way.

1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:06.879
But, as someone said, revenge is
the sweetest dish cooked in hell.

1:33:08.840 --> 1:33:10.199
Perhaps you're right.

1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:14.399
We'll cook Mr. Volta.

1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:31.959
We have a visitor.

1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:37.719
Good evening.

1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:40.759
I came to get my money back.

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:44.439
Plus 5% for a day's delay.

1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:47.959
Five percent? 200 grand?

1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:51.679
That's a rip-off rate for
borrowing party money!

1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:53.359
Party money?

1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:55.119
As your backer

1:33:55.200 --> 1:33:59.959
I contribute my own money,
which you needed but didn't have.

1:34:00.920 --> 1:34:02.559
And don't have, it seems.

1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:07.879
- When we get to the feeding trough...
- "When"? "If" is a better word.

1:34:08.480 --> 1:34:11.599
Things don't always turn out
the way we want them to.

1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:13.999
My man will contact you about it.

1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:18.599
He can call me next week.

1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:20.159
He's already here.

1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:21.559
Good luck.

1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:30.359
For your convenience

1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:36.559
the debt has been converted into
zlotys and amounts to 4,410,000.

1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:39.199
I heard 4,200,000!

1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:42.879
We're 3 minutes into the new day.

1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:49.799
So it's another 5% off the 4,200,000,
which adds up to 4,410,000.

1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:52.319
Deduct my one-million fee.

1:34:53.160 --> 1:34:55.439
Your fee is your party's business.

1:34:56.400 --> 1:34:58.479
I'm dealing only with

1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:01.359
what you owe my boss.

1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:06.719
I'll pay my debt when Lower
becomes president.

1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:09.759
Then you won't need any loans.

1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:12.559
But now things are what they are.

1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:15.639
This house

1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:17.639
is worth maybe

1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:19.879
3 million.

1:35:21.240 --> 1:35:23.319
What?! At least twice as much.

1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:26.639
When you have a buyer.
Not when you need to sell.

1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:28.239
I don't need to sell.

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:33.279
We'll get back to that.
Still 1 ,200,000 missing...

1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:34.959
What's in your garage?

1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:38.479
A Maserati and a SUV.
About one million.

1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:41.719
When you have a buyer.
But if you need to sell...

1:35:43.400 --> 1:35:44.719
200 grand at most.

1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:49.479
No, this can't be happening...

1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:54.879
- I've heard you have a boat?
- Yes. Worth 2,500,000.

1:35:56.760 --> 1:35:59.559
Throw it into the bargain
and we're even.

1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:01.119
Oh yeah?

1:36:02.320 --> 1:36:03.679
And what am I left?

1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:08.919
Health. That's the bottom line.

1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:13.119
All the rest is complementary.

1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:17.439
Here's our donation agreement.

1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:19.799
Just sign.

1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:28.359
No! Like hell I will!
You can't force me.

1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:03.759
Perhaps we can work it out.

1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:10.559
Right here to start with.

1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:21.959
It's upside down, things are
no longer the same,

1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:25.359
a single head wants to have
two crowns to wear.

1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:29.039
A sudden turn will change
the rules of the game,

1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:32.239
I plunge into this illusion

1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:36.959
and walk ahead without haste,
there's no more to be seen,

1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:40.759
imagination runs dry,
seek me, oh, seek me!

1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:56.599
Twelve million euros...

1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:01.119
Dime!

1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:07.599
Okay, okay. We'll laugh
after a good shot.

1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:15.999
