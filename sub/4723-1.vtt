02:47.267 --> 02:49.440
Can I have another?

02:50.937 --> 02:53.611
Hey. Can I have
some more coffee, please?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.619
Where you going?

02:59.613 --> 03:01.650
Excuse me.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.757
Bitch.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.797
Hello?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.613
Hello?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.984
Anyone here?

03:49.496 --> 03:52.306
Lady. Lady.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.345
Hello?

04:07.948 --> 04:09.484
What the fuck?

04:36.676 --> 04:38.383
Dean. Dean.

04:39.746 --> 04:43.387
I told you, if you keep falling asleep,
they're gonna kick you cut of here.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.724
Urn, sorry. Won’t happen again, okay?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.291
Okay.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.932
Nancy.
- Hey, Kris. You can sit wherever you want.

05:29.095 --> 05:32.167
- Actually, I’m just here to meet Dean.
- Oh, he’s right over there.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.073
Thanks.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.378
Hey.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.819
Wow, you look like you haven't--

05:41.975 --> 05:44.512
Like I haven't slept in three days?

05:49.316 --> 05:51.455
Dean, what's going on?

05:51.618 --> 05:53.222
So, what are we doing after this?

05:53.386 --> 05:56.560
Let me see if we can go
to Ashley’s or whatever.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.832
Then I don't know.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.602
Look cut, here comes your girlfriend.

06:02.762 --> 06:05.003
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. Can I get you guys anything else?

06:07.267 --> 06:08.678
Uh.... Um....

06:11.271 --> 06:14.445
No, I think we’re good. We’ll just get the check.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.784
Is that the only thing you wanna ask her, Quentin?

06:25.652 --> 06:26.687
Asshole.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.331
Hey.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.002
Why is Kris with Dean?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.509
Okay.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.212
Come on.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.514
That's fucked up.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.654
What was that all about?

06:51.811 --> 06:56.123
Um, Jesse's just--
He's pissed because Kris broke up with him.

06:56.283 --> 06:59.162
- I didn't even know they were together.
- Yeah.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.891
I guess I can keep the change?

07:04.624 --> 07:05.659
Yeah. Look...

07:07.027 --> 07:08.370
...I'm sorry about the mess.

07:08.528 --> 07:10.940
- These guys are just--
- I'm used to it.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.509
So you ever get tired
of working here every weekend?

07:13.667 --> 07:16.170
Do you ever get tired
of coming here every weekend?

07:17.837 --> 07:20.443
Quentin. You coming or no?

07:23.343 --> 07:27.587
Sorry. Look, this should
take care of the rest of it.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.021
- Sec-1 you around.
- Sec-1 you.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.064
Listen, maybe you should
talk to somebody.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.533
I did.

07:40.994 --> 07:45.443
And he thinks all my problems
come from my past.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.836
We began going through my childhood...

07:48.001 --> 07:50.641
...and that's when they started.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.112
When what started?

07:54.541 --> 07:56.077
These nightmares.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.319
Nightmares.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.257
So, what, you can't sleep?

08:02.882 --> 08:05.192
I can sleep.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.758
I just don't want to.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.334
Okay, Dean, listen to me.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.994
They're just dreams.
Okay? They're not real.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.941
These dreams...

08:17.097 --> 08:18.269
...they're real.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.173
They're nut.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.906
They're re-- I'm sorry, Kris.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.140
—No, it’s
—Kris,

08:25.305 --> 08:27.581
No, no. It’s fine.
I’m gonna go clean myself off.

08:27.741 --> 08:28.981
It’s okay. It’s okay.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.117
You're not real.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.049
You're not real. You're not real!

09:03.343 --> 09:05.289
I am now.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.718
Dean, what are you doing?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.952
You're not real.
- Dean, stop it. Dean.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.589
Dean, stop it!

09:14.621 --> 09:16.623
Dean!

09:18.691 --> 09:20.136
Dean!

09:31.438 --> 09:33.941
Tragedy can shake us at our core...

09:34.107 --> 09:37.145
...and it can also unite us
in our shared grief.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.915
Today we are gathered and united...

09:41.481 --> 09:45.588
...for the tragic loss of a young m I with so much life ahead of him.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.154
Let us pray.

09:49.489 --> 09:53.494
Lord, you who can
turn the shadow of death...

09:53.660 --> 09:56.641
...into the light of a new day...

09:56.796 --> 10:01.006
...as we gather to commend Dean
into your hands...

10:01.167 --> 10:06.116
...help us to wait upon thee
with penitent hearts...

10:06.272 --> 10:11.187
...and remind us of he who died
that we might live.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.902
--and the power and the glory
- forever and ever. Amen.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.472
Amen.
- Come on, sweetie. It’s over.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.640
Yeah.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.760
Let's go say hi.

10:50.917 --> 10:54.126
- Gwen. Hi, h

10:57.056 --> 10:58.694
- It’s been a long time.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:58.858 --> 11:02.135
-- Especially under these circumstances.
- Yeah, not a....

11:02.295 --> 11:05.105
You know, Nance,
if you need someone to talk to....

11:05.965 --> 11:07.376
I’m okay.
Thank you.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.673
We're setting up a crisis center
at the school.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.215
-- You know where my office is, right, Nancy?
- Yeah.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.717
We're gonna head cut. Take care.
- Good to see you.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.855
Bye-bye, Quentin.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.142
You knew Dean that far back?

11:39.299 --> 11:42.280
Jesus, that is me.
But I don't know how I'm in that picture.

11:42.602 --> 11:45.208
I didn't meet Dean until high school.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.512
Come on.

11:50.910 --> 11:55.188
- Dean said something right before he died.
- Oh, please don't.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.359
He said, "You're not real."

11:58.518 --> 12:01.556
He kept repeating it over and over again.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.497
Do you have any idea what that means?

12:06.693 --> 12:10.163
No. I don't.

12:11.531 --> 12:15.001
Think about it. What would it mean? Dean was on a load of medication when--

12:15.168 --> 12:16.203
Jesse.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.982
When it happened, it was like
somebody was making him do it...

12:20.139 --> 12:22.983
...but there was nobody there.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.487
Jesse, you have to believe me.

12:28.648 --> 12:32.790
Kris, it was late and you were scared.
Your mind was just playing tricks on you...

12:32.952 --> 12:34.989
- ...that's all.
- I believe you.

12:38.858 --> 12:39.893
You do?

12:43.630 --> 12:45.473
I've seen....

12:46.799 --> 12:48.403
- I saw--
- You didn't see anything.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.473
You weren't right there. Kris was.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.677
She’s already fucked up, I so leave her alone.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.025
You have no idea what I’ve seen.I

13:04.550 --> 13:06.530
Let’s go home.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.808
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.610
Hey, Mom, where are all the photos of me
from when I was younger?

14:35.775 --> 14:38.119
- They're not here.
- Oh, well, who knows?

14:38.277 --> 14:41.121
They’re probably packed away
over the garage. Why?

14:42.181 --> 14:45.060
Because today at the funeral I, um....

14:45.485 --> 14:49.934
I saw a photo of Dean and I
when we were, like, 5.

14:50.089 --> 14:54.333
But, you know, it's funny, I don't remember
knowing Dean before high school.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.838
Who can remember being 5 years old?

14:56.996 --> 15:00.341
Hey, why don't you pack those up?
Dinner's almost ready.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.788
Good night, honey.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.677
Remember me?

17:51.170 --> 17:52.376
Kris? You okay?

18:09.288 --> 18:10.824
What is that?

18:11.057 --> 18:12.593
Uh, nothing.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.332
Just, like, a sketch.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.333
Are you okay?

18:18.865 --> 18:21.368
- Yeah, I’m okay.
- Yeah?

18:22.034 --> 18:23.377
Are you okay?

18:24.570 --> 18:26.641
Yeah, you know.

18:28.140 --> 18:32.748
You know, like, if you ever need somebody,
if you ever wanna talk to somebody, I--

18:33.079 --> 18:36.288
I'm sure you have like a thousand
other people you could talk to...

18:36.449 --> 18:38.793
...but if you wanna talk to somebody....

18:39.485 --> 18:40.520
Thanks.

18:41.854 --> 18:45.131
Quentin. You're gonna be late to class.
Come on, buddy, let's go.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.532
- My dad.
- I know.

18:51.864 --> 18:55.368
Now, class, it was Pericles
who told the Athenian people...

18:55.534 --> 18:58.071
...they should all gather
into the gates of the city...

18:58.237 --> 19:01.309
while his naval fleet picked off the Spartans by sea.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.954
Now, it was to be a slow
but sure victory.

19:04.110 --> 19:08.456
The Spartans would never make it over the walls of the acropolis, Pericles said.

19:08.614 --> 19:12.994
• But what he didn’t take into account is that the plague would eventually strike.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.099
Open your bucks to page 84.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.392
To further complicate matters...

19:19.558 --> 19:22.698
...the Spartans were armed
with a variety of weapons...

19:22.862 --> 19:24.808
...some of them even improvised.

19:24.964 --> 19:28.741
And they would not hesitate to slaughter
every Athenian they saw...

19:28.901 --> 19:30.676
...even
children.

19:30.836 --> 19:35.410
Especially the children of soldiers.
This is where the....

19:35.574 --> 19:36.985
Wake up.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.987
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.624
You really shouldn't fall asleep in class.

19:56.128 --> 19:59.371
Hi, Kris.
- Who are you?

19:59.532 --> 20:02.638
You look just as beautiful...

20:03.035 --> 20:05.311
...as ever.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.846
You have nothing to worry about.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.784
This won't hurt...

20:16.349 --> 20:17.453
...0 Fl e...

20:18.150 --> 20:20.027
...little...

20:20.186 --> 20:21.221
...bit.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.292
Are you okay, Miss Fowles?

20:27.159 --> 20:29.070
What happened?

20:30.196 --> 20:31.675
I'm sorry.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.278
What?

20:54.954 --> 20:56.627
Kris!

21:31.190 --> 21:32.897
Rufus.

21:33.259 --> 21:34.533
Rufus, what are you doing?

21:35.561 --> 21:38.542
Huh? What are you doing cut here?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.936
Come on.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.203
Rufus.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.142
Come on.

22:09.862 --> 22:10.897
Hey.

22:11.063 --> 22:14.272
I have to fly to London
on a red eye tonight.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.037
Okay.

22:19.371 --> 22:20.975
You gonna be okay?

22:21.507 --> 22:23.350
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.313
I'm gonna be all right. Have a safe flight.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.755
I just worry about you.

22:28.914 --> 22:31.861
- Try and get some sleep.
- Okay.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.762
I'll call you when I land.

22:36.522 --> 22:37.865
I love you.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.696
Love you.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.197
Jesus, Jesse.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.906
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Are you gonna let me in?

23:54.066 --> 23:56.171
Yeah, come in.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.685
All right, I know I've been an asshole...

24:03.842 --> 24:06.948
...and I've been jealous
and I've been fucked up.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.025
But Dean was my friend too.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.389
Will you please tell me
what's been going on?

24:15.588 --> 24:17.932
I'm having these dreams.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.600
And I'm scared.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.403
I think Dean was having them too.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.713
Kris, listen, we've all--

24:33.872 --> 24:35.977
I know what you're gonna say.

24:38.844 --> 24:41.654
But now every time I dream...

24:42.715 --> 24:45.218
...I always see this man.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.594
And he's....

24:51.223 --> 24:52.930
He's burned...

24:54.927 --> 24:57.567
...and melted.
And he's always trying to...

24:57.730 --> 25:00.506
- ...attack me with these knives--
- Knives on his fingers.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.207
What?

25:06.405 --> 25:07.850
Oh, my God.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.615
We're having the same dream.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.848
- Kris, it's not possible.
- It is possible.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.651
- It's just a dream, all right?
- It's not a dream.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.961
Shh. Shh.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.792
Shh. Shh.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.489
Oh, God.

25:22.821 --> 25:24.357
I’m so afraid.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.801
All I wanna do is go to sleep,
but if I do he's gonna kill me like Dean.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.776
Maybe we should just
stop talking about it, all right?

25:33.933 --> 25:38.439
We keep talking about it, we'll keep thinking
about it, then we'll keep dreaming about it.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.479
Look at me.

25:45.444 --> 25:47.390
You'll stay with me?

25:47.780 --> 25:50.056
Of course I'll stay with you.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.947
Rufus!

26:14.573 --> 26:16.075
Rufus, get in here!

26:17.576 --> 26:18.919
Rufus!

26:19.078 --> 26:21.251
Ugh. Shit.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.725
Rufus.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.497
Rufus?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.800
Rufus, come here, buy!

26:36.962 --> 26:38.737
Come here.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.377
Ru--

26:53.812 --> 26:56.383
Ru-- Rufus.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.195
Oh, my--

27:03.822 --> 27:06.268
I was just petting him.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.506
Jess! Help!

27:10.662 --> 27:13.108
No! No!

27:13.265 --> 27:15.745
Help me, please! Help me!

27:43.495 --> 27:44.803
One, two

27:44.963 --> 27:46.442
Freddy's coming for you

27:46.598 --> 27:49.738
- Come on. Come on.
- Three, four, better lock your door

27:49.902 --> 27:51.176
We have to hide.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.442
-- Five, six, grab your crucifix
- Five...

27:54.940 --> 27:57.648
- Seven, eight, gonna stay up late

27:57.809 --> 27:59.652
...three...

27:59.812 --> 28:01.951
...two...

28:02.314 --> 28:03.850
...one.

28:04.783 --> 28:07.263
- Ready or not

28:08.987 --> 28:12.127

28:29.608 --> 28:31.212

Fm.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.083
Jess?

29:23.428 --> 29:24.805
Found you.

29:27.899 --> 29:30.436
Kris! All right-- Hey! Hey! Kris, stop!

29:30.902 --> 29:33.075
Kris! Stop! Kris!

29:40.312 --> 29:41.950
Oh, my God.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.559
Wake up!

29:43.882 --> 29:45.225
Kris!

29:46.251 --> 29:47.594
Kris!

30:00.766 --> 30:02.803
Oh, shit.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.475
Kris?

30:09.441 --> 30:11.148
Oh, God.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.385
Kris?

30:20.052 --> 30:22.225
Oh, shit.

30:26.224 --> 30:27.794
Fuck.

30:39.237 --> 30:40.443
Okay, okay.;0]

30:40.606 --> 30:42.882
Okay, okay, okay.

30:43.041 --> 30:45.749
Hey! Hey, you! I'm calling the cups!

30:50.215 --> 30:51.626
GWEN!
Honey?

30:55.554 --> 30:56.794
Nancy.

30:57.956 --> 31:00.334
- Nancy
- Yeah?

31:00.859 --> 31:03.567
It’s the middle of the night. You need to go to sleep, hon.

31:03.729 --> 31:04.764
Okay, I will.

31:04.930 --> 31:07.103
- Now.
- Okay.

31:17.242 --> 31:18.482
Shh! Shh. Shh.

31:18.643 --> 31:21.624
- Nancy, it’s me. It’s m
- Jesse. What the--?

31:21.980 --> 31:23.618
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing here?

31:23.782 --> 31:26.956
- Stop. Just listen to me, okay?
- What happened to you?

31:27.586 --> 31:31.591
- Whose blood is that? Is it your blood?
- Listen, okay? Please.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.828
- I was with Kris and--
- What'd you do to her?

31:33.992 --> 31:38.372
I didn't do anything, I'm trying to tell you. Listen to me, something's going on, okay?

31:38.530 --> 31:42.137
- Tell me what happened to Kris, Jesse.
- Someone killed her in her sleep.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.779
What?

31:47.139 --> 31:49.949
- What are you talking about?
- Don’t pretend you don’t know...

31:50.108 --> 31:52.486
...because you do.
You said it at the funeral.

31:52.644 --> 31:55.557
He’s the one who’s trying to kill us in our dreams..

31:56.081 --> 31:59.255
- All I keep hearing is the sung.
- What sung?

32:01.420 --> 32:02.922
One, two

32:03.822 --> 32:06.200
Freddy's coming for you

32:07.392 --> 32:08.496
Freddy.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.265
- That’s his name and he’s in all of our heads.
- No, that’s impossible. No.

32:14.833 --> 32:16.176
Nancy.

32:16.334 --> 32:19.076
Shit. We gotta stop this.

32:19.237 --> 32:21.683
- How?
- I don't know.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.842
Just don't fall asleep.

32:24.009 --> 32:26.216
If you die in your dreams,
you die for real.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.154
Nancy? Who's in there?

32:33.452 --> 32:34.487
Oh, shit.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.537
Police. Don't move!

32:46.431 --> 32:48.536
Get down! Get down!

32:48.700 --> 32:50.043
-- I didn't do anything.
- Down!

32:50.202 --> 32:52.239
Listen to me, I didn't do anything. Please.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.008
-- Get down!
- Aah!

32:54.940 --> 32:57.978
I loved her, man! I couldn’t kill her!

32:58.143 --> 32:59.622
What's going on down there?

32:59.778 --> 33:01.121
I didn't do anything! Stop!

33:01.279 --> 33:02.314
Shut up.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.695
- Get up.
- I didn't kill her! You know!

33:05.851 --> 33:08.764
-- Shut the fuck up.
That's a roger, two-two.

33:12.190 --> 33:13.794
Get up.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.931
- Call it in, code four.
- Get him out of here.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.507
Copy that, we've got a homicide.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.147
Code four. Homicide suspect in custody.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.641
Nancy! You know! You know who did it!

33:33.445 --> 33:35.015
Coming in.

33:36.815 --> 33:38.522
Open three.

33:39.317 --> 33:41.058
Clear.

33:41.219 --> 33:42.596
Clear four.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.995
-- Let him cut.
- All right.

33:46.091 --> 33:48.571
Hold five open.

33:52.330 --> 33:53.434
Open four.

34:30.936 --> 34:33.246
Hello?
- Hi, it's Nancy.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.645
Hey.

34:34.806 --> 34:38.083
You said to call you if I needed to talk.

34:39.377 --> 34:42.016
- Yeah.
- Kris is dead.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.597
Stay awake.

34:48.753 --> 34:52.063
- Stay awake.
- Quiz-et.

34:58.063 --> 35:00.839
Shut the fuck up.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.060
That'll be $24.97.

36:12.504 --> 36:17.453
Five, four, three, two....

36:27.586 --> 36:30.157
Five, six, seven....

37:00.385 --> 37:01.693
Nightmares?

37:04.789 --> 37:05.824
Yeah.

37:08.526 --> 37:09.903
Freddy?

37:12.464 --> 37:13.636
Open four.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.380
Get up.

37:18.536 --> 37:20.948
Folks posted your bail.

37:54.139 --> 37:56.244
Jesse, help me.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.350
Help me, please.

39:04.909 --> 39:06.752
Kris?

39:12.917 --> 39:15.454
- Oh, God.
- No.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.959
Just me.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.099
What do you want from me?

39:23.294 --> 39:25.137
Hmm. I don't know, Jesse.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.506
You think you can turn back time?

39:28.833 --> 39:30.141
- Answer me!
- No.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.577
Do you think you can
bring the dead back to life?

39:32.737 --> 39:34.444
- No. No!
- No?

39:35.173 --> 39:37.175
I didn’t fucking think so.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.880
No! No! No!

39:40.445 --> 39:45.861
Why are you screaming?
I haven't even cut you yet.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.494
I didn't do it! I'm innocent

40:27.659 --> 40:30.367
Get me cut of here!

40:31.129 --> 40:33.336
Let me the fuck cut of here!

40:36.334 --> 40:40.180
Did you know
that after the heart stops beating...

40:40.338 --> 40:43.342
the brain keeps functioning for well over seven minutes?

40:45.076 --> 40:49.047
We gut six more minutes to play.

40:56.721 --> 41:00.760
- You okay?
- Yeah. I’m just really exhausted.

41:04.529 --> 41:05.564
Here.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.777
- What's that?
- Zoneral.

41:12.103 --> 41:16.518
It's basically speed for kids with ADD.
I've been on it since I was, like, 15.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.654
No. No. No, thanks.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.280
Nancy, look, you’re running on fumes. Here, okay? Are you sure? It’s--

41:22.447 --> 41:24.825
Yeah, I'm fine for now.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.727
I didn't take you for the religious type.

41:34.125 --> 41:37.163
Yeah, well, you gotta believe
in something, you know?

41:40.965 --> 41:43.002
What’s this one doing here?

41:43.167 --> 41:45.613
It's The Pied Piper of Hamelin.

41:45.770 --> 41:49.274
I saw it in one of my dreams. It’s about
a guy who’s betrayed by a town...

41:49.440 --> 41:52.216
...and he gets his revenge
by taking all their children.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.749
I keep dreaming about children too.

41:54.912 --> 41:57.449
And then there's also a school.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.524
Well, it’s gotta mean something.

42:00.685 --> 42:04.724
Yeah, but, I mean, what? We didn’t go to
school together until, like, 6th grade.

42:05.490 --> 42:08.494
- Look, we're running cut of time.
- What do you mean?

42:10.595 --> 42:14.008
Nightmares are triggered by the belief
that the dreamer has no control...

42:14.165 --> 42:15.667
...and this can cause insomnia.

42:16.434 --> 42:18.277
But then it says at the 70-hour mark...

42:18.436 --> 42:20.882
...the insomniac will begin
to experience micronaps.

42:21.639 --> 42:25.314
"His brain will shut down its functions
for seconds in an attempt to recharge."

42:25.476 --> 42:29.049
This basically means that you're dreaming,
but you don't know it.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.887
Like, even if you're awake.

42:32.050 --> 42:36.157
And then it says that after that,
your brain will shut down, inducing a coma.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.630
Which is permanent sleep.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.075
Nancy?

42:55.406 --> 42:57.579
Nancy?

43:00.678 --> 43:02.715
Nancy.

43:23.601 --> 43:24.773
Yeah?

43:27.105 --> 43:28.209
Hey.

43:29.507 --> 43:31.043
Hey.

43:31.976 --> 43:33.614
Where have you been?

43:33.778 --> 43:35.917
I was at the bookstore.

43:36.814 --> 43:39.021
Okay, well,
I didn't know where you were.

43:39.517 --> 43:43.192
And I just feel like, with everything
that's been happening with your friends--

43:43.354 --> 43:44.924
Hey, Mum?

43:45.089 --> 43:47.831
Do I have some sort of connection
with Kris...

43:47.992 --> 43:50.131
...and Dean and Jesse?

43:50.295 --> 43:52.036
Or Quentin?

43:52.196 --> 43:56.338
Like, maybe we went to school together
when we were little or something like that?

43:57.902 --> 43:59.575
Not that I can recall.

44:00.371 --> 44:02.578
Did we ever know a guy named Freddy?

44:04.742 --> 44:06.881
I don't think so.

44:12.617 --> 44:14.290
Okay.

44:22.627 --> 44:24.368
Good night.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.405
Good night.

44:45.717 --> 44:47.924
Hey, it's Gwen.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.530
Nancy's starting to remember.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.606
Honey, you okay?

45:55.770 --> 45:57.750
Yeah, I'm fine, Mum.

45:57.905 --> 46:01.478
- All right. I'm going to bed.
- Okay.

47:23.224 --> 47:25.727
Little Nancy.

47:27.061 --> 47:29.302
All grown up.

47:29.463 --> 47:31.409
You're just a nightmare.

47:31.565 --> 47:33.476
That's right.

47:33.634 --> 47:36.843
No one can prove I was ever here.

47:37.104 --> 47:38.947
Who are you?

47:41.542 --> 47:44.523
You don't remember?

47:45.813 --> 47:47.258
You must.

47:49.483 --> 47:51.724
You’re my number one.

47:53.888 --> 47:56.061
You're my...

47:56.957 --> 48:00.404
...little Nancy.

48:03.364 --> 48:05.207
I set an alarm.

48:05.366 --> 48:07.403
Yes, you did.

48:07.568 --> 48:09.479
In your dream.

48:12.573 --> 48:14.382
You smell different.

48:22.717 --> 48:23.855
Quentin?

48:24.018 --> 48:26.055
Nancy, he gut to him. Jesse's dead.

48:26.454 --> 48:28.559
He died in his sleep.

48:28.856 --> 48:30.563
I saw him.

48:30.725 --> 48:34.434
- l fell asleep. I saw Freddy.
- All right, I’m coming over.

48:35.263 --> 48:37.004
Okay.

48:48.175 --> 48:50.086
Shit.

48:59.153 --> 49:00.427
So Bad ham’s a preschool.

49:00.588 --> 49:03.467
It’s on the other end of to It was closed years ago.

49:03.624 --> 49:06.002
Can't find any pictures.

49:06.594 --> 49:08.471
Wait, come here.

49:11.365 --> 49:13.072
I drew this after my dream.

49:17.705 --> 49:21.278
I don't know. I've never seen it before.

49:22.643 --> 49:26.056
How is the guy in our dreams
connected to the school?

49:26.213 --> 49:28.056
I don't know.

49:30.785 --> 49:32.856
But I know my mom's hiding something.

49:40.494 --> 49:41.632
There's nothing here.

49:48.702 --> 49:50.340
Help me.

49:57.578 --> 49:59.285
What is that?

50:15.596 --> 50:17.542
We're all here.

50:18.499 --> 50:19.705
Kris, Jesse, Dean.

50:21.001 --> 50:23.413
It's me, it's you, it's--

50:29.010 --> 50:31.251
What are you doing?

50:31.679 --> 50:32.919
What are you doing?

50:33.881 --> 50:36.191
Nancy, what is going on?

50:36.584 --> 50:39.394
- Give me the picture.
- I don't understand.

50:39.553 --> 50:44.400
You said that....
You said that we didn’t know each other.

50:44.725 --> 50:47.399
But we're all in this picture.
We went to school together.

50:47.561 --> 50:49.598
Give me the picture.

50:50.264 --> 50:52.073
- It’s okay.
- Why would you lie to me?

50:52.233 --> 50:55.703
- I didn't lie.
- It's right here. Why would you lie to me?

50:55.870 --> 50:58.407
- Stop lying. You're lying to me.
- I'm not lying to you.

50:58.572 --> 51:01.212
- Stop lying to me!
- I am not lying to you!

51:01.375 --> 51:04.584
I didn't want you to have to go
through your life with this memory!

51:04.745 --> 51:08.318
I didn’t want you to remember.
I wanted you to forget!

51:08.482 --> 51:10.155
Remember what?

51:14.154 --> 51:17.260
What happened at that preschool?

51:18.492 --> 51:20.870
Smile, everybody.

51:21.028 --> 51:22.905
You guys look great.

51:23.064 --> 51:28.104
There was a man at the preschool.

51:28.269 --> 51:30.476
His name was Fred Krueger.

51:31.305 --> 51:32.750
One, two

51:32.906 --> 51:34.852
Freddy's coming for you

51:35.242 --> 51:38.348
Three, four
Better lock your door

51:38.512 --> 51:40.321
He was a gardener.

51:41.615 --> 51:44.425
He lived in the basement
of the preschool...

51:44.585 --> 51:47.759
...and you kids were his life.

51:51.559 --> 51:53.197
Four...

51:53.561 --> 51:55.302
...three...

51:55.463 --> 51:56.771
...two...

51:57.264 --> 51:58.538
...one.

51:58.699 --> 52:00.372
We didn't wanna believe it at first.

52:00.534 --> 52:02.639
• FREDDY Ready or not...

52:03.103 --> 52:05.014
You all were so innocent.

52:05.172 --> 52:07.277
...
here I come.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.718
And you, Nancy...

52:10.444 --> 52:13.118
What are you drawing? That is so good.

52:13.280 --> 52:14.759
...you were his favorite of all.

52:14.915 --> 52:17.156
You know what?
I got some other drawings.

52:17.317 --> 52:20.696
And they're, like, really bad drawings.
Maybe you can help me fix them?

52:20.855 --> 52:22.857
And then we started to notice things.

52:29.430 --> 52:32.843
Yeah. Uh, he has been acting
a little strange lately.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.971
He takes us to the secret cave.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.181
It’s okay. It’s all rig ht.

52:41.742 --> 52:43.915
So, what did you do? Did you call the police?

52:44.078 --> 52:48.049
He left town before we ever
were able to confront him.

52:48.382 --> 52:51.261
He's gone. He can't hurt you anymore.

52:51.418 --> 52:53.728
So these dreams that you're having...

52:55.055 --> 52:58.127
...they're repressed memories...

52:58.592 --> 53:01.937
...from a terrible, terrible time.

53:03.431 --> 53:04.910
I hope that you’re rig ht.

53:08.269 --> 53:10.579
We have to find the other kids
in the picture.

53:10.938 --> 53:13.748
- What are you talking about? No.
- It doesn’t make any sense.

53:13.907 --> 53:16.945
- There's gotta be more to it. It's not--
- This makes total sense.

53:17.111 --> 53:19.182
You heard your mum.
These are just memories.

53:19.346 --> 53:21.622
- What if she’s wrong?
- We’re experiencing them...

53:21.782 --> 53:24.854
- ...living them, but they're just memories.
- How do you know that?

53:25.018 --> 53:27.259
Memories don't kill you.

53:34.028 --> 53:38.238
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Quentin, get in the car.
- It's my dad. I gotta go.

53:38.532 --> 53:41.206
- We have to do something.
- Look, stop.

53:41.368 --> 53:42.972
This is crazy. Listen to yourself.

53:44.972 --> 53:46.849
I'm sorry.

54:01.989 --> 54:06.699
I want you to do 400 warm-up.
Then do a 200-back-breast drill swim.

54:06.860 --> 54:09.966
Quentin, I need you to focus.
I need you to wake up, get into this.

54:10.130 --> 54:12.041
Let's go. All right, guys.

54:12.199 --> 54:14.770
Step up. Let's go. On the blocks.

54:18.205 --> 54:20.344
Take your mark.

55:11.125 --> 55:13.127
Make sure you're working
your underwaters...

55:13.293 --> 55:15.204
...hit the turns, in and out really quick.

55:15.362 --> 55:17.342
Powerful dolphins off the wall.

55:17.498 --> 55:21.969
All right, guys, we’re gonna do eight 300s, descend one to four, hold five to eight.

55:22.136 --> 55:25.583
All right, hop cut.
On the blocks, guys. Let's go.

55:29.309 --> 55:30.652
Let's step up.

55:32.680 --> 55:34.819
Take your mark.

55:40.588 --> 55:42.363
Come on, pick it up. Let's go. Come on.

55:42.523 --> 55:45.868
Come on. Come on, let's go. Attaboy.

55:49.363 --> 55:51.604
Come on, now. Come on.
Come on, let's go.

55:52.833 --> 55:54.779
Come on.

55:55.402 --> 55:57.211
Come on!

56:34.341 --> 56:36.014
Wait!

56:41.949 --> 56:43.053
Hey!

57:05.572 --> 57:07.017
Okay.

57:07.174 --> 57:10.587
- Krueger!
- - Come on cut, you bastard!

57:20.621 --> 57:23.329
Goddamn it. You open this door, Krueger!

57:23.490 --> 57:24.594
What do you think I did?

57:24.758 --> 57:28.171
- I didn't do anything!
- Get your ass cut. Open the fucking door!

57:28.328 --> 57:30.001
-- I didn't do it!
- Norm, make sure...

57:30.163 --> 57:33.167
- ...- he can't get cut the back!
- Okay.

57:37.204 --> 57:38.649
Stop!

57:38.805 --> 57:41.843
Stop. Okay.

57:46.580 --> 57:49.220
Okay. Okay.

57:57.824 --> 58:00.805
What are you doing? No, no, no.
This isn’t the right way.

58:00.961 --> 58:03.237
- We gotta call the police.
- What is the right way?

58:03.397 --> 58:06.435
Our kids get on a stand,
tell a room of people what happened?

58:06.600 --> 58:08.739
- No, we've gut to call the police.
- He's right.

58:08.902 --> 58:11.314
-- This is not the way to do this.
- This ends tonight.

58:22.916 --> 58:24.486
Okay. Okay.

58:30.424 --> 58:31.596
This is for my son!

58:40.467 --> 58:41.502
Come cut, Krueger!

59:11.865 --> 59:13.003
No!

59:18.638 --> 59:19.912
Are you okay?

59:22.776 --> 59:24.255
Go get the nurse.

59:24.411 --> 59:27.255
Breathe, breathe.
Come on. Come on, breathe.

59:27.414 --> 59:29.655
-- Relax and breathe. Come on. Come on.
- I’m okay.

59:49.369 --> 59:52.043
I had another nightmare last night.

59:52.573 --> 59:57.613
That burned man with the striped sweater,
he keeps trying to kill me.

59:57.778 --> 01:00:01.021
I ran a different way this time.
I ended up in front of a preschool.

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:05.254
I woke up before I had a chance to explore,
but it has to mean something.

01:00:07.154 --> 01:00:09.930
He chased me
into the preschool this time.

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:12.331
I got away,
made it down to the basement.

01:00:12.492 --> 01:00:15.371
But it feels like that's
where he wants me to go. Like...

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.509
...he needs me to find something.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.376
I'm starting to dream
with my eyes open.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.880
I can't tell what's real anymore.

01:00:25.672 --> 01:00:27.777
I haven't slept in three days.

01:00:28.642 --> 01:00:31.851
If I sleep, I dream.

01:00:32.012 --> 01:00:34.652
If I dream, I'm dead.

01:00:35.649 --> 01:00:39.256
Is there anybody else out there
that this is happening to?

01:00:39.419 --> 01:00:43.026
Can somebody help me?

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:44.225
Please?

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.088
They're all dead.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:09.989
I know what happened to Freddy.

01:01:13.653 --> 01:01:14.723
You killed Krueger.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.395
- Where'd you hear that name?
- You chased him...

01:01:18.558 --> 01:01:21.129
...cornered him and burned him
to death. You hunted him!

01:01:21.294 --> 01:01:23.570
We did not hunt him.
We were protecting you.

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:26.233
- From what?
- From him. From what he did to you.

01:01:26.399 --> 01:01:30.176
- From what you kids told us he did to you.
- We were 5. We would've said anything!

01:01:31.171 --> 01:01:33.617
- Why didn’t you go to the police?
- You were so young.

01:01:33.774 --> 01:01:36.414
No. God!
And the things we said he did....

01:01:36.576 --> 01:01:39.682
The cave. Did you ever find it?

01:01:39.846 --> 01:01:41.450
No.

01:01:43.583 --> 01:01:46.120
How do you know he was guilty?

01:01:46.753 --> 01:01:49.393
- Oh, my God.
- You killed an innocent man.

01:01:49.556 --> 01:01:50.626
Mm-mm.

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:54.364
There's not a day that goes by that
I don't think about that night, Quentin.

01:01:54.527 --> 01:01:56.529
Good, you deserve at least that.

01:01:56.696 --> 01:02:01.236
Quentin. When you grow up
and you have kids...

01:02:01.401 --> 01:02:04.746
...I hope you never know the feeling
of utterly failing to protect them.

01:02:04.905 --> 01:02:07.044
- Don’t tow -Son-- Don’t t

01:02:17.284 --> 01:02:18.661
You listen to me.

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:23.297
As far as everyone around here
is concerned, Fred Krueger never existed.

01:02:27.294 --> 01:02:28.739
Quentin.

01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:31.641
Quentin, wait. Wait.

01:02:31.798 --> 01:02:34.039
- What?
- Slow down.

01:02:34.568 --> 01:02:35.808
- Stop.
- We gut him killed.

01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:38.608
Our stories, our lies.

01:02:38.772 --> 01:02:40.911
- What if we can make him stop?
- What if we can?

01:02:41.074 --> 01:02:44.214
The preschool. Marcus said that
Freddy wanted him to find something.

01:02:44.377 --> 01:02:45.947
Fine.

01:02:47.914 --> 01:02:49.791
Nancy.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.830
Don't you wanna hang cut, Nancy?

01:03:16.243 --> 01:03:18.086
What are you doing?

01:03:19.679 --> 01:03:22.751
I just saw Kris in a body bag.

01:03:24.818 --> 01:03:26.889
All right, you’ve been up for too long.

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:29.033
You're having micronaps. We gotta go.

01:03:29.189 --> 01:03:31.396
Let's go find the preschool.

01:03:37.998 --> 01:03:39.341
What are we doing here?

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.711
I need more pills.

01:04:02.021 --> 01:04:04.592
Come on. Come on.

01:04:19.205 --> 01:04:24.587
Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a, um,
refill on that, please.

01:04:25.979 --> 01:04:28.016
On this, you're cut of refills.

01:04:29.816 --> 01:04:32.387
I'm gonna have to
call the doctor on this.

01:04:32.552 --> 01:04:36.125
Look, I don't have time
to call a doctor. Look--

01:04:37.056 --> 01:04:39.093
Oh, my God.

01:04:57.377 --> 01:05:00.586
Look, I've been on this stuff
since I was 15.

01:05:00.747 --> 01:05:01.851
Okay? It's totally fine.

01:05:02.015 --> 01:05:04.962
You just go back, you fill it up and--
Even just a couple.

01:05:05.118 --> 01:05:07.394
- All I need is a couple.
- No. No, I’m sorry.

01:05:26.306 --> 01:05:28.752
When I want you

01:05:29.543 --> 01:05:32.422
In my arms
When I want you

01:05:32.579 --> 01:05:35.617
Quentin. Quentin.

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:39.222
- Just fill it up.
- No.

01:05:43.423 --> 01:05:44.697
Dream, dream, dream

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:45.928
Quentin.

01:05:46.092 --> 01:05:50.268
When I feel blue
In the night

01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:55.140
And I need you
To hold me tight

01:05:55.301 --> 01:06:02.014
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream

01:06:37.043 --> 01:06:38.420
No. No.

01:06:48.021 --> 01:06:49.557
Wake up!

01:06:49.722 --> 01:06:51.668
You're bleeding.

01:06:55.562 --> 01:06:57.838
Oh, my God. What happened?

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.875
Hang on.

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.707
His sweater.

01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:06.077
- o
- He’s here.

01:07:07.474 --> 01:07:09.886
Man, you're hurt really bad.

01:07:11.911 --> 01:07:14.915
Let's go to the hospital. Come on.

01:07:19.552 --> 01:07:22.089
Dr. Blake Mason to ICU, please.

01:07:30.997 --> 01:07:32.567
Baby.

01:07:33.366 --> 01:07:35.972
Oh, honey, honey, honey,
what happened?

01:07:36.369 --> 01:07:37.973
Who did this to you?

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:39.878
Look at it, Mum. You know who did it.

01:07:42.942 --> 01:07:44.114
You know who did it.

01:07:44.277 --> 01:07:46.086
Oh, honey.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:52.623
Dr. Zeger. Dr. William Zeger to CCU.

01:07:52.786 --> 01:07:56.427
Dr. Zeger. Dr. Zeger to CCU.

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.472
Okay,
how we doing?

01:08:05.632 --> 01:08:07.339
It’s gonna be okay.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.970
I'm gonna give you
a little something for the pain.

01:08:11.137 --> 01:08:14.084
- It’ll put you right out.
- It’s okay.

01:08:14.474 --> 01:08:17.182
• No, Mom, I don’t want it. I don’t want it. I don’t want it.

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.050
- It’s okay, it’s okay.
- No, Mom, no.

01:08:19.212 --> 01:08:22.591
- I don't want it. Don't let her do it.
- This might sting a bit.

01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:24.319
-- No! No!
- No, no.

01:08:24.484 --> 01:08:25.986
- Okay. Okay.
- No!

01:08:26.152 --> 01:08:28.928
- Where’s Quentin?
- Can I have a word with you in the hall?

01:08:29.455 --> 01:08:32.834
Don't leave. Don't leave, Mum. Mum.

01:08:32.992 --> 01:08:34.801
Where's Quentin? I need Quentin.

01:08:37.596 --> 01:08:40.407
Your daughter needs to be sedated,
but I can't do anything...

01:08:40.567 --> 01:08:44.014
- ...without your authorization.
- I just want her to be cut of pain.

01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:45.671
Good. Sign this.

01:08:53.813 --> 01:08:55.622
She'll be fine.

01:09:08.294 --> 01:09:09.966
Great.

01:09:28.314 --> 01:09:29.486
Thank you.

01:09:29.649 --> 01:09:31.322
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:31.484 --> 01:09:33.555
- Yeah?
- What is that?

01:09:33.953 --> 01:09:37.162
- Adrenaline. Keep us awake.
- Where'd you get it?

01:09:37.323 --> 01:09:39.200
I stole it off one of the nurse’s carts!

01:09:40.326 --> 01:09:42.966
You can’t take that.
You have no idea what it’s gonna do.

01:09:43.129 --> 01:09:47.669
You know what? That is kind of the least of my concerns right now. You want some?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.536
No.

01:09:54.374 --> 01:09:55.580
Whoa.

01:09:56.976 --> 01:09:58.080
Are you okay?

01:10:01.581 --> 01:10:03.754
Yeah. I'm good.

01:10:04.217 --> 01:10:05.628
Let's go.

01:10:08.588 --> 01:10:11.501
- How much further?
- - We're almost there.

01:10:11.724 --> 01:10:14.295
Hey, will you talk to me?
I'm falling asleep.

01:10:15.662 --> 01:10:17.403
Yeah. What do you wanna talk about?;0]

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.441
I don't know.

01:10:21.835 --> 01:10:23.109
What's your favorite color?

01:10:25.739 --> 01:10:27.446
Blue.

01:10:35.115 --> 01:10:38.460
Look, if you really wanna talk,
how come over the last couple years...

01:10:38.618 --> 01:10:41.861
...every time I've invited you cut,
you've just never shown up?

01:10:43.022 --> 01:10:46.265
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I don't exactly fit in.

01:10:51.297 --> 01:10:54.005
Okay, look,
if we survive the next 24 hours...

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:56.841
...then I'll take you cut on a real date.

01:11:00.606 --> 01:11:02.677
Well, what if I say no?

01:11:03.877 --> 01:11:05.982
Well, why don't you sleep on it?

01:11:20.793 --> 01:11:23.330
You okay?
- I'm fine.

01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:26.034
Come on.

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:31.204
I saw him. He was right there.

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.783
We gotta go. Come on.

01:11:49.322 --> 01:11:51.097
This is it.

01:11:52.358 --> 01:11:54.497
This is the school.

01:12:27.994 --> 01:12:29.166
-- No!
- Heh-heh-heh.

01:12:29.329 --> 01:12:30.535
Are you okay?

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.537
I don't know what's real anymore.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:37.573
Come on.

01:12:38.571 --> 01:12:40.346
Follow me.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:12.043
Hey, give me your lighter.

01:13:19.746 --> 01:13:22.317
All right, well, now that we're here,
now what?

01:13:23.015 --> 01:13:25.427
Because I don't remember any of this.

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:31.425
This must be his room.

01:13:33.426 --> 01:13:36.236
Okay, he brought us here for a reason.

01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:40.645
This is definitely his room.

01:13:56.249 --> 01:13:57.592
Quentin.

01:14:10.263 --> 01:14:13.767
- What?
- There's something back there.

01:14:54.707 --> 01:14:56.243
I've been here before.

01:14:56.709 --> 01:15:00.486
If you can keep a secret,
I'll take you to a special place.

01:16:07.413 --> 01:16:08.448
What are those?

01:16:11.717 --> 01:16:13.754
What are those pictures of?

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:16.489
They're all of you.

01:16:18.958 --> 01:16:20.904
- Let me see.
- No.

01:16:31.871 --> 01:16:33.612
No.

01:16:36.576 --> 01:16:38.487
Oh, God.

01:16:39.278 --> 01:16:41.053
No.

01:16:44.584 --> 01:16:45.722
We were wrong.

01:16:46.686 --> 01:16:49.792
He's not after us because we lied.

01:16:52.325 --> 01:16:55.272
He's after us because we told the truth.

01:16:56.329 --> 01:16:59.776
He brought us here so we would
remember what he did to us

01:17:01.133 --> 01:17:02.840
God. Fuck!

01:17:06.572 --> 01:17:08.245
Fuck.

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:14.016
What dues he want from us?
He's never gonna stop.

01:17:23.522 --> 01:17:25.195
I know what we need to do.

01:17:26.025 --> 01:17:27.732
Come on.

01:17:33.599 --> 01:17:35.010
There's gotta be another way.

01:17:35.168 --> 01:17:37.808
If we just sit here and do nothing,
we're gonna die.

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:42.917
- l should do this.
- I’m the one who pulled his sweater out.

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:46.284
What if I’m the only one who can bring him out?

01:17:49.315 --> 01:17:52.762
Nancy, I can't let you go to sleep.
You're not gonna wake up.

01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:55.263
I know you won't let that happen.

01:17:58.891 --> 01:18:00.700
Wake me up if you see me struggle.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.119
Gotta believe in something, rig ht?

01:18:29.155 --> 01:18:30.998
I'm gonna be here when you get up.

01:18:31.857 --> 01:18:33.700
We're gonna make it.

01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:17.870
Aw, shit.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.928
You can't save her.

01:20:49.095 --> 01:20:50.904
Tag.

01:20:51.997 --> 01:20:53.670
You're it.

01:20:57.403 --> 01:20:59.212
Krueger!

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:02.718
Your girlfriend's here. I'll be right back.

01:21:07.813 --> 01:21:09.793
One, two

01:21:09.949 --> 01:21:13.692
Guess who's coming for you

01:21:18.424 --> 01:21:20.131
Little Nancy.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:23.364
Now that you caught me,
what game do you wanna play next?

01:21:23.529 --> 01:21:26.476
- Fuck you.
- Ooh. Sounds like fun.

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:28.907
It's a little fast for me.

01:21:31.670 --> 01:21:33.047
How about we hang first?

01:21:36.075 --> 01:21:39.022
No. It's not real.

01:21:42.214 --> 01:21:43.716
It's real.

01:21:45.551 --> 01:21:47.155
I'm real.

01:22:48.814 --> 01:22:49.849
Boo.

01:23:12.271 --> 01:23:14.717
Now, how's this for a wet dream?

01:24:00.652 --> 01:24:02.689
Quentin, wake me up.

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:06.967
This dress...

01:24:08.594 --> 01:24:11.200
was always one of my favorites.

01:24:12.231 --> 01:24:15.303
Do you remember it, Nancy?

01:24:16.368 --> 01:24:18.541
Of course you do.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:23.150
You remember everything now,
don't you?

01:24:25.411 --> 01:24:28.119
Your memories are what fuels me.

01:24:29.615 --> 01:24:31.959
No. Please don't.

01:24:33.285 --> 01:24:36.425
Your mouth says no...

01:24:36.789 --> 01:24:39.929
...but your body says yes.

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.097
Mmm.

01:24:42.428 --> 01:24:43.964
Don't turn away.

01:24:44.129 --> 01:24:45.335
Look at me!

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.505
Look what you did to me.

01:24:55.908 --> 01:24:59.321
Now it's time to play.

01:25:09.822 --> 01:25:11.699
Are you having fun?

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:21.003
Naughty girl.

01:25:27.005 --> 01:25:28.382
You can't hurt me.

01:25:29.008 --> 01:25:31.215
You're in my world.

01:25:34.446 --> 01:25:36.016
And you can't ever leave.

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:48.265
Ohh....

01:25:49.428 --> 01:25:51.965
That's music to my ears.

01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:54.804
I wanna wake up!

01:25:54.967 --> 01:25:56.571
You can't wake up.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:26:01.809
I had to keep you awake long enough
so when you finally slept...

01:26:03.776 --> 01:26:05.847
...you'd never wake up again.

01:26:07.946 --> 01:26:09.926
Nancy, wake up.

01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:11.686
Wake up, Nancy, wake up!

01:26:11.850 --> 01:26:14.490
We’re gonna be in here a long time.

01:26:15.821 --> 01:26:18.358
- Nancy, please!
- Did you really think your boyfriend...

01:26:18.524 --> 01:26:21.334
- ...could wake you up?
- Please, don't do this!

01:26:21.493 --> 01:26:23.268
Please!

01:26:23.429 --> 01:26:25.670
I'm your boyfriend now.

01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:30.179
Nancy, come back! Please, wake up!

01:26:30.336 --> 01:26:31.872
You promised!

01:26:43.749 --> 01:26:45.422
Sweet dreams.

01:26:59.164 --> 01:27:00.404
Quentin, get him.

01:27:14.379 --> 01:27:17.656
Die! Fucking bastard!

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:24.399
Nice try, Nancy.

01:27:24.556 --> 01:27:26.229
Now let me take a stab.

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:42.918
Now, why don't you just fucking die?

01:27:50.315 --> 01:27:52.295
It hurts, doesn't it?

01:27:52.451 --> 01:27:54.522
That's because you're
in my world now, bitch.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.724
Wait.

01:29:06.325 --> 01:29:09.898
- Give me some slack.
- - Yeah, aim it up a little higher.

01:29:11.530 --> 01:29:12.873
No sign of a body anywhere.

01:29:38.323 --> 01:29:40.360
Hey, Quentin.

01:29:43.462 --> 01:29:45.738
Nightmare’s over.

01:30:10.622 --> 01:30:13.159
I want you to go
straight up to bed, okay?

01:30:13.325 --> 01:30:14.861
Yeah.

01:30:18.764 --> 01:30:20.471
Hey, Mum?

01:30:21.366 --> 01:30:25.473
I know you were just trying
to protect me. Thank you.

01:30:27.739 --> 01:30:28.979
I'm just glad you're safe.
