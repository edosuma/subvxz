00:20.160 --> 00:21.880
Do you know what true love means?

00:21.960 --> 00:23.560
Do you know what that'll mean...

00:23.640 --> 00:26.080
...standing up by the person
who takes your hand?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.120
- I'm close.
- Oh, Richie!

00:30.280 --> 00:32.520
You just want one thing.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.720
When you're done, it'll be all over for us.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.160
- I brought some of these.
- No!

00:38.360 --> 00:40.040
- Not yet.
- What do you mean, "not yet"?

00:42.680 --> 00:45.280
Half hour? Five years?
You always say, "not yet."

00:45.440 --> 00:47.480
Not yet!

00:47.600 --> 00:49.040
A guy could die from this.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.200
You want to be responsible for that?

00:52.320 --> 00:54.360
- I'll do it with my hands.
- No.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.480
I could do it with my hand.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.840
Richie, I got my reputation to worry about.

01:00.280 --> 01:04.120
You're a guy. Guys don't have to
worry about their reputations.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.240
- But Despie, I love you.
- Oh, you love me?

01:07.720 --> 01:09.800
Richie, I love you.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.160
I love you.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.080
Oh, Richie!

01:17.680 --> 01:22.480
LES SEIGNEURS

03:07.360 --> 03:08.680
Turkey?

03:08.960 --> 03:10.920
Turkey, is that you?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.280
- What happened, man?
- What are you talking about?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.160
What did you do to yourself now?

03:15.440 --> 03:18.360
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you talking about?

03:20.040 --> 03:22.920
I shaved my head.
I got to go talk to those guys over there.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.120
Listen to me!

03:25.200 --> 03:27.680
I got you in the Wanderers.
I thought you was my friend.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.480
I am your friend.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.840
You don't need those guys.
You're a Wanderer.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.400
You can't be a Wanderer for graduation.
I'm thinking about the future, Joey!

03:35.480 --> 03:38.560
I'll be a Fordham Baldie.
Wait and see. The Baldies got it made.

03:39.080 --> 03:43.040
Those guys look like a bunch
of Neanderthal retards. Look at them.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.240
Are you kidding?
Those are the Fordham Baldies, Joey!

03:46.400 --> 03:50.400
They shave their heads so their hair
won't get in their eyes when they fight.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.960
Nobody fucks with the Baldies, man.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.200
Those guys look like
a bunch of pricks with ears.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.840
What did you just say?

03:58.960 --> 04:01.840
- I ain't talking to you. Scram!
- Easy, Joey.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.360
Hey, Peewee.

04:03.440 --> 04:06.600
Joey, this is Peewee.
She's head of the Baldies' Ladies Auxiliary.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.920
That's Terror's woman.
She goes with Terror.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.320
How you doing, Peewee?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.720
- What did you just say?
- Nothing, Peewee.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.720
I ain't talking to you!
What did you just say about pricks?

04:15.960 --> 04:17.560
I said, "pricks with ears."

04:17.800 --> 04:21.399
Terror, this asshole said we look like
a bunch of pricks with ears.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.240
He didn't say that, did you, Joey?

04:23.360 --> 04:25.920
- Oh, yeah, then what did he say?
- I didn't say that.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.320
I didn't say you guys looked
like a bunch of pricks with ears.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.120
I said you looked like
a bunch of ears without pricks!

04:32.200 --> 04:33.520
Terror, how you doing?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.080
- Can I talk to you?
- Get him!

04:36.200 --> 04:38.160
When I get a hold of your ass...

04:38.280 --> 04:40.280
Let me alone. I like you guys.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.920
Come on, Turkey, come on!

05:07.960 --> 05:09.680
Let's get these motherfuckers!

05:09.880 --> 05:11.600
Come on, Terror!

05:14.200 --> 05:16.440
Wait till I catch you, you skinny prick!

05:26.840 --> 05:28.240
Come on, Terror!

05:33.120 --> 05:34.680
Look at them go!

05:35.800 --> 05:38.440
Hey, you! Come back, you creep!

05:46.640 --> 05:49.160
- Oh, shit!
- What's wrong?

05:51.080 --> 05:52.680
I gotta go.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.440
- What?
- I gotta go.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.640
It sounds like a Wanderer's in trouble.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.160
A what?

06:08.280 --> 06:10.360
You should be careful, now.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.920
Hey, Buddy! Somebody's in trouble!

06:23.000 --> 06:25.120
Looks like we're gonna
have to stomp some ass.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.680
- What?
- It's Joey and Turkey.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.760
Joey, don't worry.
We'll pummel whoever's following you!

06:29.960 --> 06:31.400
The Baldies!

06:31.520 --> 06:33.640
Baldies? Shit! Let's get out of here!

06:55.880 --> 06:56.800
Shit.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.800
Joey, what did we do?

07:07.880 --> 07:09.880
Nothing! They just started chasing me.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.560
Cut it out, asshole!

07:12.680 --> 07:16.040
Easy, easy, free Turkey, man.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.760
This little guy don't mean no harm, man.
He's just a fucking idiot.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.360
Leave the kid alone.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.840
You say something, mother...

07:34.280 --> 07:36.920
Hey! You hear me? I'm talking to you.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.040
Leave the kid alone.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.080
You know who you're talking to, asshole?

07:41.160 --> 07:43.400
Beat it. Nobody fucks with the Baldies.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.120
Asshole!

07:58.800 --> 08:01.320
Leave the kid alone.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.200
Got you.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.440
Your ass is grass, motherfucker.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.640
- Beat it, you scumbag!
- Joey, what's wrong with you?

08:22.160 --> 08:23.040
Terror.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.440
You'd better watch your mouth, kid.

08:52.680 --> 08:53.800
Stay back.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.920
They shaved your head, Turkey?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.920
- Yeah, they shaved his head.
- Oh, Jesus.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.680
I didn't think I'd see the day when Terror
backed down to anybody like that.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.560
Did you see how chickenshit he was?

09:08.680 --> 09:10.720
He wasn't chickenshit, Joey.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.320
Terror ain't chickenshit of nobody.
He's just waiting for the right time.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.000
Are you kidding?
Did you see what this guy did here?

09:17.400 --> 09:19.600
- Where'd he go?
- Hey, come back here, man!

09:29.760 --> 09:31.120
Where'd that guy go?

09:45.960 --> 09:46.920
Strong.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.160
I'm strong.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.000
Leave the kid...

09:52.320 --> 09:53.240
...alone.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.040
Jujitsu.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.040
It's you.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.440
I've been looking all over for you.
Where did you go?

10:09.760 --> 10:12.600
I want to thank you.
What you did back there was great.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.400
Forget about it.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.240
You shouldn't have wised off
to those guys.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.880
But I don't like to see big guys
pick on little guys. Know what I mean?

10:28.040 --> 10:30.560
I can take care of myself, all right?

10:32.320 --> 10:33.240
Sure you can.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.440
What are you doing here
waiting for my elevator?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.720
- I'm waiting to go home.
- You live here?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.600
This building?

10:44.160 --> 10:45.600
Hey, what floor?

10:46.760 --> 10:48.880
- Four.
- I live on four.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.840
You're the new people, right?
My mom told me that.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.680
How do you like that? We're neighbors.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.240
I'm Joey.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.520
- Perry.
- Perry.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.920
Hey, where is it!

11:02.280 --> 11:06.240
Where is it, you bastards on the fifth floor!
I know what you're doing up there.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.360
Assholes!

11:12.080 --> 11:13.600
Excuse me, ma'am.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.240
I heard about your old man, how he died.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.480
The Wanderers are the guys
to get in with around here.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.720
We've got a great football team,
great athletes, lots of girls.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.880
Maybe you can join up,
I'll show you around, okay?

11:34.040 --> 11:35.200
Okay, thanks.

11:35.400 --> 11:40.160
You got to get into a gang.
You just ain't safe unless...

11:42.840 --> 11:45.080
This is my father, Emilio, and this is...

11:45.240 --> 11:47.520
I told you not to be talking in the hallway!

11:52.520 --> 11:54.920
Perry? Darling, is that you?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.600
Yeah, it's me, Ma.

11:57.960 --> 12:02.160
Would you mind running down
to the store and getting me something?

12:02.280 --> 12:05.160
Don't worry, sweetie.
They won't ask you for I.D.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.520
Okay?

12:09.400 --> 12:14.000
Under sunny skies, WNCA, New York City.
Good morning.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.400
You've got to lock your doors around here.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.560
Great car, great car. Come on, we're late.

12:22.120 --> 12:25.280
You get to drive your mother's car
to school every day?

12:25.760 --> 12:29.480
She don't drive it so much.
She's got high blood pressure.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.960
Too bad.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.640
Are you 18?

12:33.360 --> 12:35.240
Yeah, I'm 19.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.200
- I got held back, you know?
- Yeah, sure.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.160
Joey!

12:41.320 --> 12:43.800
Hey, how's it hanging, guys?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.880
You were really cool yesterday, man.
John Wayne.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.680
Joey, what's his name?

12:48.840 --> 12:52.720
What's your name? Don't sweat it, Joey.
I just want to meet the guy, man.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.360
Joey.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.120
Would you get off my ass!

12:58.920 --> 13:01.000
We got all kinds of gangs here.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.480
See these guys here?

13:04.040 --> 13:06.680
Those are the Executioners.
Over here on the left...

13:06.840 --> 13:10.120
...the Ghettos, they're Jewish.
On the right, in green, the Irish...

13:10.240 --> 13:12.480
...the Delaney's. You're Italian, right?
- Yeah.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.400
Then you got to get into an Italian gang,
like the Wanderers.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.640
Hey, Turkey,
where's the dollar you owe me?

13:18.720 --> 13:21.600
- How you doing? Good to see you.
- Here's your dollar.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.000
Then you got your nigger gangs.
You got your Cavaliers...

13:25.040 --> 13:28.000
...you got your Pips here,
and then you got your Mau Mau's.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.520
D.B. Stands for "Del Bombers,"
the toughest nigger gang around.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.200
Hey, coon Stitch. Hey, how you doing?

13:36.360 --> 13:37.760
Good to see you.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.280
What's this?

13:40.400 --> 13:41.800
Hey, Teddy Wong!

13:42.480 --> 13:45.760
Twenty-seven guys with the last
name Wong, who all know jujitsu.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.800
Could kill you with one judo chop.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.040
Do you got gangs like this
where you come from?

13:50.160 --> 13:52.520
We don't got this stuff
in Trenton, New Jersey.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.920
Don't worry about anything.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.680
Hang out with the Wanderers,
and we'll take care of you.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.600
Richie, where are you?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.400
Richie, we got him.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.160
Richie Gennaro.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.960
- Perry Maguire.
- How you doing?

14:16.040 --> 14:18.080
I want to thank you for helping us out.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.120
Anytime you need anything,
you let me know. All right?

14:25.160 --> 14:26.880
Richie, I got your homework.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.480
Wow, that's a nice job.

14:32.880 --> 14:37.360
You even goofed up my handwriting.
Thanks, you're my main man.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.680
Hey, Richie?

14:39.920 --> 14:43.920
Turkey, take your hat off and get your feet
off the desk. It smells bad enough.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.480
Very funny, Mr. Sharp.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.640
I said, "take your hat off!"

14:50.120 --> 14:51.360
Come on, take it off.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.800
What's the matter?
You guys never seen a Baldie before?

15:06.800 --> 15:09.240
Mr. Sharp, did you see
what Turkey just did?

15:09.440 --> 15:10.560
Shut up, stupid!

15:10.880 --> 15:13.120
Are you gonna make me, motherfucker?
Let's go.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.440
All right, settle down.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.080
You've both got detention.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.680
Mr. Sharp, man. Damn.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.200
Mr. Sharp...

15:29.200 --> 15:31.680
Them white boys here,
they's getting obstreperous.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.480
Anybody know what week this is?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.640
- Brotherhood Week.
- Very good, Stitch.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.040
Now, who wrote this?

15:43.640 --> 15:44.600
You did.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.160
"A. Lincoln."

16:04.040 --> 16:05.880
"Race, creed, color."

16:07.080 --> 16:12.000
I wanna see how many different races
we have just here in this classroom.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.720
All Jewish people, stand up.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.440
Okay. All the Italians.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.640
All right! Okay. Settle down.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.640
All Colored.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.480
What's the matter, Stitch?
Don't we have a group to suit you?

17:04.839 --> 17:06.760
No, I'm an Eskimo.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.319
Where can I get some Eskimo pie?

17:13.680 --> 17:15.079
Okay.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.520
Colored. Italian.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.760
Or is it Colored and Eye-talian?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.680
Is that the way your old man talks?
The Colored.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.800
How about you guys?
What do you say after school, Eye-talian?

17:37.880 --> 17:39.520
Let's talk some straight talk.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.200
Let's call a spade a spade.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.480
Let's talk straight. Give me some names.

17:47.800 --> 17:48.840
Come on.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.080
Nigger.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.240
Grease ball.

18:02.680 --> 18:03.760
- Yeah.
- That's right.

18:03.880 --> 18:04.880
Jungle bunny.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.480
Swamp Guinea.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.480
Handkerchief head.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.400
Mountain wop.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.040
Bogey.

18:18.120 --> 18:18.920
Guinea.

18:19.040 --> 18:19.960
Coon!

18:20.120 --> 18:21.080
Dago.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.000
Watch you mouth, boo-boo.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.000
Spear-chucker!

18:24.080 --> 18:26.640
Motherfucker, I'm gonna chuck a spear
up your ass!

18:26.760 --> 18:28.840
Hold it! I can't write that fast.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.320
Is that it? That's all?

18:34.120 --> 18:35.960
We ran out of names pretty fast.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.720
What did we learn here today?

18:38.920 --> 18:41.800
Mr. Sharp, the white boys forgot
a couple of names.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.920
They forgot spade...

18:47.400 --> 18:49.720
...spooks and jigs.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.320
Put that on the board.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.240
How did you guys forget those names?

18:56.400 --> 18:58.760
There must have been
a mental lapse, Mr. Sharp.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.040
Mr. Sharp, I think it's because...

19:01.120 --> 19:04.880
...they are a bunch of dumb-ass,
grease ball, Guinea, wop...

19:07.200 --> 19:08.320
You black bastard.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.200
Fuck you, dago motherfucker!

19:10.280 --> 19:11.200
- Jigaboo!
- Your mama.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.600
- You ain't got one.
- What'd you say?

19:13.680 --> 19:14.800
Fuck you!

19:18.240 --> 19:19.320
Hold it!

19:32.880 --> 19:33.840
Hold it.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.720
We'll meet you at Prince Charles' Field,
okay? Saturday.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.480
You got it. Saturday at noon.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.560
No guns and no knives.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.080
I want everybody after school, everybody.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.800
Fuckin' hang that little bastard.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.160
That's the only way you're going to learn
about brotherhood!

19:56.600 --> 19:58.360
What's the matter with you guys?

19:58.520 --> 20:01.120
Haven't you heard "sticks and stones
will break my bones...

20:01.200 --> 20:03.440
"...but names will never hurt me"?

20:05.320 --> 20:06.600
Come on, motherfucker!

20:07.160 --> 20:08.800
All you motherfuckers!

20:09.960 --> 20:11.040
Get down there!

20:12.800 --> 20:14.680
What's the matter with you animals?

20:18.200 --> 20:19.480
Any homework?

21:50.240 --> 21:51.960
We don't want to get into this.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.080
I know the neighborhood's changed,
but are you guys chickenshit?

21:55.320 --> 21:58.160
- You guys started it.
- We didn't start it.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.360
- We heard you did.
- You heard wrong.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.960
- What else?
- We ain't Italian.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.000
I know you ain't Italian.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.080
Come on, what do you say?

22:13.360 --> 22:14.840
We say good luck to you.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.160
Yeah, good luck, faggots.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.120
Motherfucking faggots.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.320
Come back here.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.160
We're with you. No nigger will face this.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.880
What are you doing?
We don't need those. Put it away.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.280
You kidding me?
Those guys will show up with pieces.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.760
Don't trust them.
You got to go for them first.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.480
- He got a point, Richie.
- Me and Clinton agreed.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.960
- No guns or knives.
- You gonna trust that nigger?

22:42.120 --> 22:46.160
You don't know where you're living.
We ain't going with you without these.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.000
Then you ain't going with us.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.200
Nice knowing you guys.

22:52.000 --> 22:52.920
Have fun.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.080
Fucking pussies.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.760
I don't know, man.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.320
Come on.

23:00.320 --> 23:03.440
Look, Richie, call my friends, the Baldies.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.320
Those guys like me.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.960
Call them, I think they'll come in with us.
With them in, it's all over.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.640
Listen, I ain't calling those guys.
I got my pride.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.880
Sometimes all you got is pride.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.080
Got to hold your head up high.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.920
I seen this movie once
where this guy was tortured by the Japs...

23:22.720 --> 23:25.080
...but he wouldn't give them
any information.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.160
Every time they tortured him...

23:27.520 --> 23:29.840
...he started singing
the Star-Spangled Banner.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.960
Wow. What happened?

23:35.320 --> 23:37.920
- They killed him.
- Shut up, you're depressing me.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.760
What was that?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.680
You got the jitters.
I'm going to take a whiz.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.400
I thought I heard something.
You guys hear anything?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.520
Baldies got guys, too.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.640
It's the Wongs!

24:21.320 --> 24:23.840
Teddy Wong. How you doing?

24:25.880 --> 24:28.160
- I thought you was coming earlier.
- We did, man.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.200
We waited until now
to make ourselves known.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.120
You've just been hanging out
in the bushes?

24:33.800 --> 24:36.000
- Pretty spooky.
- We've been listening.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.480
I called you Wongs here tonight
for a reason.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.760
- We know your reason.
- Gonna join us?

24:42.440 --> 24:43.280
No.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.760
- You're gonna join them?
- Stay back!

24:47.560 --> 24:48.920
Don't fuck with the Wongs.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.360
The Wongs never joined with anybody...

24:54.520 --> 24:55.480
...yet.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.200
What do you mean by "yet"?

24:57.320 --> 24:59.760
We'll decide what's right
when the time comes.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.920
The Wongs will wait and see.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.400
When what time comes?
What do they mean?

25:16.480 --> 25:18.200
- Where did they go?
- I don't know.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.520
Get back here!

25:19.680 --> 25:22.240
No, get the fuck out of here,
you Chink assholes.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.480
No sweat, they can't hear me.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.600
Don't fuck with the Wongs!

25:28.760 --> 25:30.240
Richie, listen to what I just heard.

25:30.320 --> 25:34.400
It ain't just the Del Bombers, man.
They're bringing in the Pips, the Cavaliers...

25:34.520 --> 25:38.080
...the Mau Mau's.
- Shit, we've got a fucking race war.

25:38.720 --> 25:42.240
Maybe we'll bring in some guys
from Brooklyn, the Golden Guineas.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.720
One thing: We got to stay cool.

25:45.600 --> 25:49.120
Did you notice those spades got
two million cousins all over the country?

25:49.280 --> 25:51.880
We need help,
and I'm calling my friends in, the Baldies.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.400
Enough, man. Forget it.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.040
Guess who.

25:58.360 --> 25:59.640
Al Capone.

25:59.840 --> 26:00.600
No.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.880
- It's me.
- What do you know.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.640
What are you doing, Richie?
What's that list?

26:07.760 --> 26:10.360
- You're gonna rumble?
- No, it's just some business.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.400
I'll talk to you later, all right?

26:12.480 --> 26:14.560
I thought we were
gonna buy some records.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.280
Maybe a little later, all right?

26:17.640 --> 26:18.800
Love you, baby.

26:18.880 --> 26:19.920
Love you, too.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.880
Richie, my daddy wants to see you.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.480
How you doing?

26:38.120 --> 26:39.880
I heard Chubby was looking for me.

26:40.040 --> 26:41.440
Over there.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.680
Over here, Richie.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.440
- You wanna see me, Mr. Galasso?
- Yeah.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.920
Me and my brothers
wanted to see you because...

26:56.040 --> 26:58.920
...we heard you got some trouble
with the Colored.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.160
How did you hear about that?

27:03.160 --> 27:04.800
How did we hear about that?

27:05.480 --> 27:09.080
How do the Galasso brothers hear
about anything in this neighborhood?

27:11.240 --> 27:13.280
The reason I'm asking is that...

27:13.520 --> 27:15.240
...maybe you could use some help.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.840
No, we can handle it.

27:17.120 --> 27:21.480
Remember, Richie, in this day and age,
in this neighborhood...

27:22.600 --> 27:26.080
...there's lot of ways to skin the cat.
Do you know what I mean?

27:26.440 --> 27:28.560
- Not exactly.
- Think about it.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.080
You know where to find us.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.200
You guys wanted Joey to come
so he could heal old wounds.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.960
I respect these guys.
Give them a good rumble, they're happy.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.600
Look what's coming.
Look what the cat dragged in.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.320
Hey, my favorite Wanderer.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.800
You know, Joey,
if I had a dog with a face like yours...

27:49.160 --> 27:52.080
...I'd shave its ass
and teach it to walk backwards.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.040
Very funny, Terror. Very funny.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.680
We've come to you because
we've got problems with the niggers.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.600
You guys know Roger, don't you?

28:03.120 --> 28:04.600
What do you mothers want?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.800
We've got some personal business here.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
You guys go to Tulley High, don't you?

28:10.680 --> 28:15.160
Maybe you know a cousin of mine.
Clinton Stitch? He's in the Del Bombers.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.880
Stitch is a good friend of mine.
You know Clinton, don't you?

28:19.040 --> 28:20.200
Everybody knows Clinton.

28:20.280 --> 28:23.120
I think we can talk business better
in the park.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.080
- Is this a joke?
- Sure, it's a joke.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.680
Just like your little joke
about pricks with ears.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.760
- Or was it ears without pricks?
- Where are we going?

28:35.560 --> 28:38.000
Hey, Terror, I knew you wasn't chickenshit.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.880
Turkey, do me a favor, will you?

28:40.040 --> 28:42.560
Sure, Terror,
you know how I feel about you guys.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.800
Hold these.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.680
We're thinking about making you guys
honorary members of the Baldies.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.120
That's great, Peewee.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.160
We thought we might start
by shaving your heads.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.960
Come on, not my hair, all right?

28:59.920 --> 29:04.200
Too good for us?
Maybe we won't take your hair off.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.760
We'll just take something else off.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.640
- Drop your pants.
- Sure, whatever you want.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.800
Not you, Turkey. You're gonna help us.
Hop over.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.880
- Why don't you guys just shave our heads?
- Go on.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.040
We got delicate feelings.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.480
You guys seem to think
you're too good for us.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.400
You guys are a bunch of fruits!

29:23.480 --> 29:26.560
There you go again, hurting our feelings.

29:26.840 --> 29:27.960
Tie their hands.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.360
Turkey, I want you to tie
one end of the rope right...

29:32.600 --> 29:33.760
...there.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.120
Jeez, Terror...

29:35.240 --> 29:36.480
Turkey, don't do it.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.080
Turkey, it's just a little test
to get in to the Baldies.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.080
To see how brave a guy can be.

29:41.840 --> 29:44.160
I know these guys heard of rock 'n' roll...

29:44.320 --> 29:46.480
...but you guys ever hear of rock 'n' cock?

29:46.640 --> 29:48.640
How about cock 'n' roll, mothers?

29:49.400 --> 29:51.320
Hey, Turkey, do a Boy Scout knot.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.160
Turkey, don't do it, man.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.040
Turkey, you're a Wanderer.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.360
Turkey, you fucking homo.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.040
Don't get me mad, Joey.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.520
Okay, Turkey, pick up both of the rocks.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.400
Any last words to say to your dicks?

30:07.560 --> 30:10.440
Say, "Bye-bye, dick, nice knowing you."

30:12.840 --> 30:14.320
Turkey, throw the rocks over.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.200
Sorry, guys.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.480
Oh, shit.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.840
Looks like we got to get shorter twine.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.200
Don't you guys go away.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.640
We'll be right back.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.240
Come on, Turkey,
I got a soft spot in my heart for you.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.400
- What do we do now?
- Can't get anybody to help us, Richie.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.640
They left us here to die of exposure.

30:46.120 --> 30:49.200
Don't fuck with the Baldies!
This is just a warning.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.520
I'm glad you've come to us finally, Richie.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.000
You've got a good sense of reality.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.480
We're gonna help you
with your problem with the Colored.

31:01.640 --> 31:02.960
How are you feeling today?

31:03.840 --> 31:06.640
- The old bowling arm feeling hot?
- Sure, always hot.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.320
"Sure, always hot."

31:09.600 --> 31:12.720
Wasn't so hot last week
against those Long Island guys.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.320
Which reminds me...

31:14.560 --> 31:16.440
...see who's bowling out there tonight?

31:16.680 --> 31:18.720
- No.
- Take a look.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.040
Shit.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.680
It's those guys from Long Island.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.000
You know what they're doing here?

31:33.200 --> 31:34.200
I don't know.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.000
They've come here for a rematch.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.480
Mr. Galasso, those guys are too good.
They killed us last week.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.520
You know, Richie...

31:45.000 --> 31:46.680
...you need some confidence.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.360
The other kid can wait here.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
You guys are gonna win big tonight.

31:57.160 --> 32:00.040
Are you kidding, Peppy?
These guys are good enough to be pros.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.360
My instinct is they is pros.
Chubby checked up on them.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.400
They go around to the different lanes.

32:05.960 --> 32:08.640
They hustle the house bowlers.
They hustle the hustlers.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.920
- They are greedy boys.
- What's Chubby gonna do?

32:12.040 --> 32:14.040
Chubby got a way of creating miracles.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.240
What'll it be?

32:26.160 --> 32:27.280
Who is this?

32:27.520 --> 32:28.560
Five big ones?

32:28.680 --> 32:30.720
- We ain't got that much.
- No?

32:31.320 --> 32:32.640
What do you got?

32:37.600 --> 32:38.800
Twenty-five hundred.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.680
Twenty-five hundred.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.160
Guess that'll have to do.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.240
We'll leave the money there.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.280
Whoa, pal. We get to pick the alley, right?

32:47.440 --> 32:50.400
Anything! Come on, you guys gonna play?
Let's cut the bullshit.

32:50.520 --> 32:54.560
Wanna keep score, too? Go ahead.
I'm just a dumb Guinea. What do I know?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.560
For all I know, you guys could be pros.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.520
What are you guys talking about?

33:03.680 --> 33:06.360
Your guys are really good,
is what we're talking about.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.160
What's happening?
Where's everybody going?

33:20.400 --> 33:23.240
Just closing for a while, for a little privacy.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.640
What are you doing?

34:01.800 --> 34:05.520
You guys are so good, it wouldn't be fair
unless you bowled handicapped.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.400
Twenty pins?

34:06.480 --> 34:09.400
Twenty pins?
That's not what I was thinking about.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.080
- Fifty pins.
- No good.

34:11.239 --> 34:13.199
What I had in mind was a real handicap.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.000
I seen this in my favorite movie.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.960
You ever seen The Hustler?

34:43.840 --> 34:46.199
Good enough for Paul Newman,
good enough for you.

34:58.440 --> 34:59.720
Now, where was we?

35:00.680 --> 35:03.040
Oh, yeah, you guys come to us
with a problem.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.360
We'll take care of it.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.800
But remember, we're sportsmen.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.040
And we're interested in making
a little bet on you.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.720
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

35:15.720 --> 35:19.640
I understand you're playing the Coloreds
in North Bronx Football League soon.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.480
I think it would be to our mutual benefit...

35:22.800 --> 35:24.840
...if you won one for the Galassos.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.200
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.120
There's two kinds of people.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.280
Those with common interests...

35:34.880 --> 35:36.880
...and assholes like those hustlers.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.840
What I like
about these Colored sportsmen...

35:40.320 --> 35:42.160
...is they got common interest.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.920
Not all your Colored are assholes.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.800
It's a shame to see kids
beating each other's brains out.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.560
Especially when there's
no financial advantage.

35:51.880 --> 35:53.200
- Right, Albert?
- Right.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.040
How are you?

35:56.920 --> 35:58.520
- How you doing?
- Okay, you?

35:58.680 --> 36:02.040
We're gonna have a little football game.
Sporting event.

36:02.840 --> 36:06.040
I'm glad these boys brought
us into the picture.

36:06.280 --> 36:10.240
It gives these kids a chance to settle
their differences in a beneficial manner.

36:10.480 --> 36:13.680
Let's adjourn to the bar for a discussion.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.120
It's cool.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.760
What's all this?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.400
I'm making a banner.

36:44.320 --> 36:48.040
Our big game with the Del Bombers
is coming up. You should come, Dad.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.560
- It should be a good game.
- Look at me when you talk to me.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.120
What kind of drawing you doing?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.960
Why can't you do something normal?

36:59.120 --> 37:01.960
A mountain lake, a tree, birds?

37:02.360 --> 37:03.480
That's art.

37:04.160 --> 37:07.040
Those aren't normal people you draw.
They're freaks.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.720
You hear me?

37:08.960 --> 37:10.080
Emilio.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.400
Joey, time to eat.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.000
They're freaks.

37:15.480 --> 37:18.560
Hey, good. I got to drop a few pounds.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.640
I got to get more pressed.

37:20.960 --> 37:21.880
Come on, let's eat.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.600
It's us against the world.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.800
I mean, just the Wanderers.

37:29.040 --> 37:32.680
- We got to stick together.
- We got to stick it to the Del Bombers.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.560
Joey, I got a game for you.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.920
- See who can hit the softest.
- Yeah, sure.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.240
You go first.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.520
That's pretty good. It's my turn now.

37:45.080 --> 37:48.040
What did you do that for?
I thought you said the softest.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.640
I did. You win.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.120
I'm in love! Look at that.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.280
Hey, I'd like to stick it to that.

37:55.640 --> 37:59.360
I'm in love. Hey, you know what, man?

37:59.800 --> 38:02.600
Today's the perfect day for elbow-titting.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.920
Hey, Perry, pull over.

38:31.720 --> 38:32.640
Watch it!

38:32.800 --> 38:36.200
Watch where you're going!
Don't people look where they're going?

38:36.560 --> 38:38.480
Watch it in the future!

38:44.440 --> 38:46.720
- You get any tit?
- She had nice ones.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.280
She didn't know what was happening.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.320
Who's next?

38:49.880 --> 38:51.000
Perry, you go.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.640
- Me? No.
- Come on.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.120
What are you, chicken?

38:57.720 --> 38:58.680
Chicken?

38:59.680 --> 39:01.520
Free feels, right in the street?

39:01.800 --> 39:02.760
Too late.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.400
Quit bothering me!

39:09.080 --> 39:10.720
Don't be afraid, all right?

39:12.400 --> 39:13.360
Watch this.

39:18.640 --> 39:22.040
Here goes the elbow-titting champion
of the Bronx.

39:28.560 --> 39:29.920
Hey, Joey, get a good one.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.680
Do it, Joey baby!

39:51.200 --> 39:53.200
You boys are pigs!

39:53.480 --> 39:55.680
You have no respect!

39:55.840 --> 39:56.920
Lady, I'm sorry!

40:02.600 --> 40:05.240
- You boys are pigs!
- Yes, ma'am.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.640
I never realized how dangerous
elbow-titting was.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.840
You win a few, and you lose a few.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.840
- Don't hit me.
- Look at that!

40:25.600 --> 40:27.320
- Richie, your turn.
- No, no.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.280
Come on, chickenshit.

40:31.880 --> 40:34.560
Hey, come on, let's go.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.760
"Hello, hello...

40:46.000 --> 40:46.960
"...hello!"

40:47.200 --> 40:49.440
- Watch where you're going.
- You get a good one?

40:49.600 --> 40:50.880
What do you mean?

40:51.040 --> 40:53.800
- I bet you think that's funny.
- What are you talking about?

40:55.080 --> 40:57.200
I'm sorry I bumped into you.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.960
You think I bump into every girl
out on the street?

41:00.400 --> 41:03.800
No, just the ones you're trying to
cop a free feel from.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.720
I wasn't trying to do it...

41:06.800 --> 41:09.720
Bullshit. Aren't you a little old
to be doing stuff like this?

41:09.800 --> 41:11.880
Where I'm from, they call it molesting.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.280
Where are you from?

41:14.240 --> 41:16.000
Come on. Scram, pal.

41:16.280 --> 41:17.680
What school do you go to?

41:17.800 --> 41:20.760
- Look, whatever your name is...
- Richie. What's yours?

41:22.000 --> 41:26.040
Nina. I don't talk to every guy
who tries to elbow-tit me...

41:26.200 --> 41:27.760
What is this?

41:29.440 --> 41:31.040
I know this, great book.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.240
The whole thing, or just the dirty parts?

41:33.440 --> 41:35.720
Come on, Nina,
don't take me over the coals.

41:35.880 --> 41:39.120
Can't you have a straight talk about
books with a molester like me?

41:40.560 --> 41:43.040
Sex fiend, hey, over here!

41:44.960 --> 41:46.760
I hear your mom calling you, Richie!

41:48.160 --> 41:49.920
Your friends want you back.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.880
- You tell them everything?
- Are you kidding?

41:53.080 --> 41:54.040
Just the dirty parts.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.600
I think we should
see each other again sometime.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.520
I've got to go, I've had hard day.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.520
Hey, I want you to meet a friend.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.800
- Joey, meet Nina.
- Hey, Nina.

42:06.080 --> 42:09.120
You wouldn't know it to look at him,
but he's a great artist.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.720
I think you two could hit it off.

42:11.800 --> 42:14.160
- I've got to get going.
- Give us your number, okay?

42:14.240 --> 42:16.480
I'm not giving you my number.
Hey, do you mind?

42:16.520 --> 42:19.000
- Off the car, big fellow.
- Joey, give her your number.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.920
Maybe she'd like to go and party with you.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.040
- My number?
- Yeah, K-0505-64.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.600
K-0505-64!

42:24.920 --> 42:27.840
That's my number, K-0505-64.
You got that?

42:28.600 --> 42:29.760
Think she'll call?

42:30.280 --> 42:31.320
Sure she will.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.000
Richie, you're a true Wanderer.

42:39.520 --> 42:41.360
I hate to see one like that get away.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.320
Let's go.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.400
We'll get them for you, Joey.

42:52.080 --> 42:54.240
Don't let her get away.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.120
She was something else.

43:00.520 --> 43:03.440
Richie, now I think I know
what you mean by true love.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.640
- There she goes.
- Don't lose her.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.400
Where the hell are we, man?

44:22.880 --> 44:26.000
Is that her ahead of us, there?
Thought it was, but it ain't.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.760
Perry, where are you taking us?

44:28.840 --> 44:31.840
I don't know my way around here.
I thought you were gonna tell me.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.480
- I got to get home. I got to go to work.
- It's getting late.

44:35.680 --> 44:38.800
- My old man is going to kill me.
- Fucking relax.

44:40.760 --> 44:42.600
Jesus, come on.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.080
We'll find our way out of here.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.600
Let's ask that lady up there.

44:53.960 --> 44:55.320
Forget about it.

44:56.760 --> 44:58.040
Jesus.

45:04.200 --> 45:07.080
Look out! Watch it, look out!

45:08.840 --> 45:09.800
Shit!

45:17.360 --> 45:18.840
I think I know where we are.

45:18.920 --> 45:20.560
Ducky Boys!

45:20.760 --> 45:22.600
Shit, those are Ducky Boys.

45:23.240 --> 45:24.960
Let's get the hell out of here!

45:29.200 --> 45:30.360
Get the fuck out of here!

45:31.560 --> 45:33.440
You little prick.

45:33.560 --> 45:36.320
- Perry, get back here!
- You can't talk?

45:43.920 --> 45:44.880
Perry, no!

45:50.280 --> 45:51.320
Perry!

46:13.320 --> 46:14.440
Get in the car!

46:17.560 --> 46:18.960
Get the fuck out of here!

46:32.440 --> 46:34.360
Get him to a hospital! Emergency.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.960
We got to get him to a hospital.

47:00.680 --> 47:02.560
I ain't telling my ma about this.

47:02.680 --> 47:06.360
The doctor said it ain't good
for the high blood pressure.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.600
What are you gonna do? Wear gloves?
Stay here.

47:10.600 --> 47:13.800
I'm going upstairs
to see if the coast is clear.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.920
Old man'll kill me for coming in this late.

47:19.960 --> 47:22.240
Emilio, I'll see you tomorrow.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.280
Bring me a little something, will you?

47:26.160 --> 47:27.120
Honey.

47:38.600 --> 47:41.720
- Joey, what is it? What's the matter?
- Nothing.

47:43.080 --> 47:45.200
Nothing. It's okay.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.920
Daddy, I know. No talking in the hallways.

47:51.160 --> 47:55.520
You got a call, some dame's calling.
Sounds like a librarian.

47:55.720 --> 47:58.800
You got books out? Come on, get inside.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.440
Perry, is that you, honey?

48:05.960 --> 48:08.160
- Hello?
- Hi, is this Joey?

48:08.640 --> 48:11.560
- Yeah.
- This is Nina, we met today.

48:12.680 --> 48:15.120
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.

48:15.440 --> 48:18.240
I thought I'd call you up,
you said something about a party.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.480
Who'll be there?

48:19.880 --> 48:23.200
All the guys. Richie, the first guy
you met on the street today.

48:23.480 --> 48:26.040
- Yeah.
- He'll be there. Great guy.

48:26.280 --> 48:27.520
- You liked him?
- Yeah.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.560
Joey, what are you so nervous about?

48:37.960 --> 48:39.520
Jumping around and shit.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.120
I got to take a piss.

48:41.320 --> 48:44.280
She'll be here in a minute.
Listen, I want to tell you something.

48:44.360 --> 48:46.760
I think we got it made
with this chick, you know?

48:46.920 --> 48:49.760
- She called you up the other day, right?
- Yeah, right.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.960
She's coming to get us for the party?

48:52.760 --> 48:55.040
- What are you going to do?
- What do you mean?

48:55.360 --> 48:58.200
You need a game plan.
How else are you gonna get laid?

48:59.080 --> 49:02.480
I can take care of myself.
Do you know so much about it?

49:02.880 --> 49:06.200
Forget it. I'm just trying
to tell you how to get the job done.

49:06.320 --> 49:09.360
Do me a favor, keep your mouth shut.
You sound like my mother.

49:09.480 --> 49:12.640
Your mother? Tell her she forgot
her shoes under my bed last night.

49:12.800 --> 49:16.480
Your mother's got a mattress
on the back of the curbside...

49:16.640 --> 49:18.400
Leave the hair alone, will you!

49:18.600 --> 49:20.960
- Quit acting like a faggot!
- You wish.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.880
- You blow.
- You wish.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.240
Here she is.

49:27.200 --> 49:28.920
Hi, Nina.

49:29.120 --> 49:31.720
- Get in back.
- And leave my main man up here alone?

49:33.080 --> 49:34.640
Let's go, we're late already.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.360
How you doing, baby?

49:37.520 --> 49:40.920
What is this shit on the radio?
Ain't you got some decent music?

49:41.160 --> 49:42.800
I'll change the station.

49:43.920 --> 49:47.360
All right. Rock 'n' roll, that's more like it.

49:48.240 --> 49:49.360
Come on, let's go.

49:49.520 --> 49:52.480
- Straight ahead?
- Go left at the corner.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.720
Over here. Pull over behind this car.

50:06.880 --> 50:07.800
Right here.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.560
- What is this car?
- It's my parents'.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.520
I borrow it when they go out of town.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.400
They're out of town?

50:16.120 --> 50:18.240
- Get down.
- What's wrong?

50:19.080 --> 50:21.440
Stay down, it's Galasso.
We don't want them to see us.

50:21.520 --> 50:23.720
- Who?
- It's Despie's parents.

50:27.160 --> 50:30.400
He doesn't want us to break training.
He's got cash riding on us.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.080
That dress has got real class.

50:36.120 --> 50:36.880
Shall we?

50:41.840 --> 50:45.440
- Goddamn, Richie.
- New undies for your birthday, Joey.

50:50.520 --> 50:54.120
Can I get out of here?
I can't breath down here.

50:58.920 --> 51:01.920
What's going on? Is the coast clear?

51:11.440 --> 51:12.880
Come on, they're gone.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.440
Okay, let's Wampo!

51:27.880 --> 51:28.800
Okay, Popeye.

51:32.240 --> 51:33.200
Cleopatra.

51:35.400 --> 51:36.800
Eye-line turn.

51:46.160 --> 51:47.160
Popeye.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.120
Cleopatra.

51:59.080 --> 52:00.280
Sweep the floor.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.840
Hey, look who's here.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.120
How you doing, man?

52:18.840 --> 52:20.360
Jesus, what the hell is that?

52:20.480 --> 52:22.800
- That's the woman I know?
- A woman?

52:22.960 --> 52:24.920
That's what it looked like, kid.

52:25.040 --> 52:28.560
If your pants were any tighter,
we'd be able to see the veins in your balls.

52:28.760 --> 52:29.920
Didn't know you were looking!

52:30.600 --> 52:32.480
Joey! Joey!

52:33.320 --> 52:35.560
I didn't know Purina made sports jackets.

52:35.680 --> 52:37.560
I didn't know Purina made bad breath.

52:52.120 --> 52:53.080
Richie!

52:56.880 --> 52:57.840
Come here.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.000
Do you want to dance, Joey?

53:08.480 --> 53:10.880
I'm not very good.
Maybe when a slow one comes on.

53:21.160 --> 53:22.320
Thanks, man.

53:33.560 --> 53:34.840
Thanks, guys.

53:36.440 --> 53:40.320
I've got an urge tonight to maybe...

53:41.240 --> 53:43.800
...go out tonight and...

53:44.360 --> 53:46.720
...stomp some ass. I just got to...

53:47.320 --> 53:49.040
...just rumble.

53:50.120 --> 53:52.480
Break some heads. Know what I mean?

53:52.560 --> 53:55.240
I know what you mean.
I got an urge, too, man.

53:55.480 --> 53:58.000
I know where
there's a Wanderers party tonight.

53:58.080 --> 53:59.760
The little guys.

53:59.880 --> 54:02.080
They're a bunch of pussies.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.960
Go out, stomp some ass.

54:05.160 --> 54:08.120
Maybe even get laid. Sorry, Peewee.

54:08.320 --> 54:11.080
I didn't mean it. I just got an urge.

54:11.920 --> 54:14.400
- You guys wanna fight?
- Yeah, we wanna fight.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.360
You got to be kidding, pal.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.880
- You gonna fight us?
- I ain't talking about me.

54:18.960 --> 54:21.120
I'm talking about the toughest guys
in the world.

54:21.240 --> 54:25.120
Man, who you talking about?
Nobody's tougher than the Baldies.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.160
Why don't you guys come in here?

54:29.360 --> 54:30.320
Come on.

54:30.440 --> 54:33.800
I've always wondered what you do in here.
Jerk off?

54:34.680 --> 54:35.640
Guys...

54:35.840 --> 54:38.480
...I got a way you can stomp
all the ass you want...

54:38.680 --> 54:41.640
...and make the world safe for democracy
at the same time.

54:42.280 --> 54:44.160
Here you are, gentlemen.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.320
Pass those out. Here you go.

54:51.640 --> 54:52.600
Thanks, man.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.720
Come on, girls. Get moving.

55:04.040 --> 55:05.600
Buddy, come on, babe.

55:15.840 --> 55:17.840
Joey, it's so noisy down here.

55:18.760 --> 55:21.280
Do you suppose she'd mind
if we went upstairs to talk?

55:22.000 --> 55:23.720
No. Hey, Rich...

55:25.040 --> 55:27.480
We're gonna go upstairs to talk.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.600
Just don't get any jizzy marks
on the Galassos' bed.

55:31.720 --> 55:33.760
I'll make you eat it off with a spoon.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.760
Hey, good luck.

55:36.440 --> 55:39.200
My daddy will kill me
if they make a mess upstairs.

55:39.440 --> 55:41.400
They won't, don't worry about it.

55:41.600 --> 55:44.040
Maybe we should go upstairs, too.

55:44.360 --> 55:46.560
"I swear as a citizen of the United States."

55:46.840 --> 55:50.720
"I swear as a citizen of the United States."

55:51.760 --> 55:55.120
After signing this document,
you'll become Marines.

55:55.960 --> 55:57.960
Terror, don't do it!

55:59.600 --> 56:01.400
"I swear that I have never been...

56:01.480 --> 56:03.640
"I swear that I have never been...

56:03.760 --> 56:05.840
"...a member of the Communist party."

56:06.040 --> 56:09.160
"...a member of the Communist Party."

56:10.840 --> 56:13.280
At least you guys don't need no haircuts.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.160
Terror, you know what you've just done?

56:16.320 --> 56:18.400
You've just joined the fucking Marines.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.320
You baboon.

56:22.400 --> 56:24.160
You know what I think we just done?

56:24.520 --> 56:25.440
What?

56:25.720 --> 56:28.280
I think we just joined the fucking Marines.

56:31.080 --> 56:34.000
I hope you know what we just done,
is just a joke.

56:35.080 --> 56:36.040
Sorry, boys.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.400
What do you mean, "sorry, boys"?

56:38.760 --> 56:40.280
I ain't even 21.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.840
You ain't got to be.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.960
Come on, Mister, give them a break!

56:46.160 --> 56:47.320
Them's the rules.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.160
My mother will die without me.

56:49.400 --> 56:52.560
- Should've thought of that before.
- What did you say about my mother?

56:53.120 --> 56:54.400
Get out of here.

56:56.920 --> 56:59.720
Don't worry.
The Marines will make men out of you.

57:01.480 --> 57:03.360
You mothers might enjoy a real war.

57:07.360 --> 57:10.920
Remember, no jewelry, no bobby pins,
none of that kind of stuff.

57:11.160 --> 57:15.000
Both socks count as one.
It's got to be authentic article of clothing.

57:16.800 --> 57:18.840
How did you guys meet, anyway?

57:20.240 --> 57:22.240
We just sort of bumped into each other.

57:25.960 --> 57:29.440
- What have you got?
- Pairs of deuces.

57:29.600 --> 57:30.880
Pairs of deuces.

57:32.400 --> 57:34.840
Too bad. Pair of queens. I beat you.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.120
Not so fast, I got four of a kind.

57:38.920 --> 57:40.160
Four twos?

57:40.440 --> 57:42.560
- Yep.
- Nobody gets four twos.

57:42.720 --> 57:46.400
Let me see. A straight is when
you've got numbers in a row, right?

57:46.920 --> 57:47.720
You got one?

57:47.800 --> 57:49.560
No, but I got something very close.

57:49.640 --> 57:51.840
Four, six...

57:51.920 --> 57:53.120
...seven, eight and ten.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.040
If only I got a five and a nine.

57:56.680 --> 57:58.720
Oh, that's too bad. Too bad.

58:02.640 --> 58:06.040
I don't even know you guys.
Do you play with them often, Despie?

58:06.520 --> 58:08.000
I never played this before.

58:08.120 --> 58:09.960
How'd we get into this, anyway?

58:10.080 --> 58:11.560
- Who's deal is it?
- Your deal.

58:11.680 --> 58:12.800
Ladies, ante up.

58:18.680 --> 58:21.400
- Joey shed his shirt.
- Shut up, asshole.

58:23.680 --> 58:26.560
Let's go. You gonna play or what?

58:28.000 --> 58:29.080
Let's go.

59:52.280 --> 59:54.120
What kind of polish is that, Despie?

59:54.280 --> 59:55.240
Glitter.

59:56.880 --> 59:58.120
Glitter!

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.600
How do you know when you're flushed?
When you're all red?

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:10.560
It's got to be all the same suit,
like all hearts or all diamonds.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.280
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:21.280
I've got a real good hand.
Let me see, give me...

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.560
...four cards.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.760
Four? Sure.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.720
Richie, give me two.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.520
You can't take any cards
without putting something up.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.280
Still in?

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.960
- Come on, let's go.
- I better pass.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.560
Can't get anything back by passing.
You have to win it back.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.080
How come we never win?

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.600
Who could say? Confidence...

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.160
...luck of the draw.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.560
The wheel of fate just keeps spinning.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.480
All right, but don't look.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.120
Richie...

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.840
Richie!

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.840
No fair, you guys are looking.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.000
- Are you in, Despie?
- I'm out.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.280
What have you got, Joey?

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.880
- I fold.
- What have you got, Nina?

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.320
Pretty good. Look.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.120
Not good enough.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.440
Not good enough. Full house, beats again.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.280
Hey, something fishy's going on here.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.840
In a couple minutes,
we're gonna be naked, then what?

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.400
- What are you doing?
- My deal?

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.400
Then we play one more hand.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.000
For what?

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:39.960
For what?

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.760
Then we get to do whatever we want to.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.080
- What's the matter with you?
- That's it!

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.360
Sex fiends are at it again.
We got to get back to the party!

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.000
We've got to get back to the party.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.440
We're at the party.
We're just having some fun.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.440
We don't have to stop playing.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.760
We've been lucky. You'll win this next one.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.440
A little innocent game.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.760
One more hand.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.160
There's nothing going on downstairs.
Come on.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.160
Stay, will you? We'll have some fun.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.080
She's going. Go!

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.840
Despie!

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.680
Come on, Terror, get in the car.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.920
Come on.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.000
How about it, baby?

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.680
Put me down, Terror. You're drunk.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.840
You don't sound good when you're drunk.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.440
- Come on, man.
- Let's go!

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.760
Terror, get in the car, man.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.040
Come with us, baby.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.680
Don't go.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.760
All right. Let's stomp some ass!

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.600
Let's go someplace quiet to talk.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.840
My car.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.280
That's my daddy's cup!

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.280
Stupid son of a bitch!
How am I gonna get home?

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.200
Richie?

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.600
Richie!

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.960
Richie!

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.840
I can't forget about you
since the first time I saw you.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.800
Let's go inside!

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.640
We'll go inside and get some women.
Nookie, right?

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.360
You go inside, Turkey.
Bring it back out here.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.640
Yeah, man, "nookie to go," right?

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.120
Excuse me, may I take your orders?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.960
Everything on it, I like it rare.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.240
On the double, Private.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.840
Yeah, man, right.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.080
I'll be right back.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.600
Did you see Richie?

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.200
Richie!

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.920
I was looking all over for you...

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.000
- Hey.
- Hey, what?

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.200
What are you looking at?
You're looking at a Baldie now, faggot!

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.680
Scumbag, look out the window.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.040
Joey's out there!

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.120
Have a nice time, motherfucker.
Terror's gonna settle your ass.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.440
Terror! Roger, where the fuck
are you guys?

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.960
Asshole, I don't want to see you
around here, you understand?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.280
Get the fuck out of here.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.279
Terror!

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.399
Roger, hey wait up!

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.359
Where are you guys going? Terror?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.399
Joey, wait, listen. Joey, come here.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.960
Joey, listen to me.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.160
I had to have a talk with her.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:54.359
I can't get her out of my mind.
I met her first.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:59.000
For Christ's sake, Joey, you and me...
I couldn't fight the thing no more.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.000
Don't fucking touch me!

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.520
She's just another fucking broad.
She don't matter anyway.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.160
No, she ain't, man. She's special.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.160
You shitheel! You lousy, rotten shitheel.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.600
This is what I get for putting out.
I knew this would happen.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.440
Terror!

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.360
Baldies!

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.480
Terror, where are you?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Roger, get down here,
you bald-headed nigger!

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.040
Roger, I'm just kidding, man.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.080
Roger!

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.240
Terror!

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.840
Terror!

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.560
I didn't know there was
anyone around here.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.440
I got lost.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.560
I need someone to talk to.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.800
It's cold out.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.360
Where are you coming from?

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.120
So what?

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.320
You go to high school around here?

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.240
You go to high school?

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.920
We can go in the park.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.960
I'm not joking, I'm serious.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.120
Yeah.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.360
Help me!

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:08.680
Terror!

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.080
I want to tell you guys something.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.760
It wasn't that bad. Not as you think.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.040
I'm gonna miss Turkey.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.200
Here comes the bastard.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.200
Hey, Richie.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.800
Richie, I got your homework.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.680
Guys, what are you doing?

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.080
The President and Mrs. Kennedy...

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.480
...just minutes before he was shot.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.440
This is not confirmed.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.720
We have it on
what would normally be good authority...

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.520
...that the President has died.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:35.080
However, we repeat, this is not confirmed.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.160
Now, as you can see here...

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.920
...Mrs. Kennedy steps into the car...

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.960
That's her waving.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.200
That's the President waving.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.440
Richie, you know what true love means?

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.360
That it means standing by the person
you love, thick and thin?

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.800
Do you?

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.320
Hello, Father.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.120
You know what else true love means?

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.560
True love for a woman means
having the baby of the man she loves.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:32.120
Do you know what true love in a man is?

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.800
True love in a man...

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.280
...is wanting that woman who loves him
to have his baby.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.560
- Don't you feel that's what true love is?
- Oh, yeah. Definitely.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.200
Richie...

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.320
...I really feel true love for you.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.400
I'd like to know if you feel true love for me.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.040
Sure I do.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.240
Sure you do what?

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.400
I really do.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.800
You really do what?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.040
I really feel true love for you, Despie.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.520
The parents should be in love.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.560
I mean, when I told my daddy
I thought I was pregnant...

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.640
...he told me he thought the parents...
- What?

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.000
Richie, my daddy wants to see you.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.400
Look, I ain't no hard guy.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.040
I was your age once.
I used to put them away...

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.360
...like there was no tomorrow,
but one thing...

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.840
...I never did it with nobody's daughter.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:47.280
Not only did you do it with my daughter,
but you knocked her up, you dumb wop!

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.760
You ain't got nothing up here.
It's all down here.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.200
All right. I ain't no hard guy.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.880
It takes two to tango and all that bullshit.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.920
She's been banging since junior high
and you're the first jerk to get caught.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.160
Daddy, how could you?

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.600
Maybe you should've given her
an ankle bracelet.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.280
Stop the jerking off.

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.560
The thing is, you knocked her up.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.760
And now you gotta pay the price
and do the right thing.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.560
It's the sportsman's way.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.360
Hey, what's this?

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.200
Now you're scared.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.360
Get up!

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.680
To my new son-in-law.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.440
You'll live in the basement.
We got wood paneling.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.000
Gloria! Come on down!

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.120
Come on over here, pupsie!

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.120
Hey, do you like clams?

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:17.080
I'll take us all to City Island
for some clams. I ain't no hard guy.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.840
- What does it say?
- Eighteen inches.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.480
Eighteen inches.
You know what it was in '40, '41?

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.080
Seventeen and a half.
In Greece, it was eighteen.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.920
Did I tell you I seen him the other day?
He's turned into a tub of lard.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:38.040
Feel it.
Eighteen inches, right where it counts.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.040
Who do you think
the judges would vote for now?

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.440
I'll be right down!

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.680
- Yeah!
- Keep it down in there!

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.440
Why don't you go see Joey play, Emilio?

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.320
I don't want to get embarrassed.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.840
I understand he's good.
You won't get embarrassed.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.920
- Go on, Emilio.
- Not today. I'm busy.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.960
"We're so great! We're first rate!"

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.840
Shit. Looks like them niggers
ain't gonna show.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.600
- The chickenshits.
- Yeah.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.120
Always have been.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:19.840
What's that?

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.600
Holy shit! It looks like
they ripped off a circus.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.200
"We gotta win, we gotta win,
we gotta really win!"

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.240
Where's that boyfriend?

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.640
Okay!

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.680
You know why
they call you the Wanderers?

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.440
Because after this game,
you'll "wander" what happened.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.600
Come on, motherfucker! Right now!

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.920
Play ball!

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.320
Come on, break it up.
Break it up. Come on.

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.400
- Give me a 5-2.
- Break!

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.080
All right!

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.880
Thirty-nine!

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.880
Twenty-four!

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:48.800
Time! Time!

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.680
Fucking protection!

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.120
- Stay in your pocket!
- Pocket?

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.280
You got your hands in my pockets.
You guys block like a bunch of fruits.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.760
- Don't talk like that.
- I'll talk the way I want, understand?

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.160
- I'm the quarterback!
- Then be the quarterback.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.160
Shut up, all of you guys!

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.440
Maybe some of you guys got a right
to hate my guts.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.880
I've been watching.
If we had Joey at halfback...

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.920
...and me at quarterback,
we'd have a chance.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.920
That's the way it was meant to be.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.920
I've been thinking a lot about it...

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.800
...and I want to say to Joey here, I'm sorry.
I want to apologize.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.640
What do you say?

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.480
That's great man, great.

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:38.600
All I want to say is that
whatever I've done is in the past.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.000
All is forgotten. Okay?

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.600
We've got to win this game
for the Wanderers.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.720
What do you say?
Wanderers forever, right, Joey?

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.680
Let's kill them!

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.600
Set.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.200
Strong right, full house.
Wanderers' special, on one, ready?

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.720
Going left, full house, death destruction.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.080
Tie game, mothers!

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.280
Throw me the goddamn ball!

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.640
You got it, brother.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.720
- Okay, let's have the ball.
- I ain't going over there.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.120
You want it, you go get it.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.080
You guys chickening out?

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.840
Hell, no. There's some short, runny-ass
sucker over there with a big blade.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.960
- What?
- Yeah.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.080
- I don't see nothing?
- You don't?

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.480
They're here!

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.720
- Look, they're here!
- What?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.520
Ducky Boys.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.480
Where?

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.240
I ain't fucking around, man. He was here.

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.840
Everyone's starting to see things.
What is this?

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.360
Can't we just play some football? Let's go!

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.240
Shit.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.800
Ducky Boys.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:43.960
What are they doing here?

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.680
Where are they all coming from?

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:58.120
- What are we gonna do?
- Don't run.

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.240
Fight them. We'll stay.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.960
We're gonna stay. Nobody goes.

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.480
Shit!

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.840
There's hundreds of them.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.120
I think my mother's calling me.

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.680
I'm thirsty. I think I'm gonna get a Coke.

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.920
They killed Turkey.

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.560
Sons of bitches. Come on!

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240
Come on!

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:01.840
Joey!

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.440
Hey, come and play.

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.400
We beat them! We won!

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.880
Come on, fucker sucker!

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.320
Are you okay?

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.600
Hey, we beat them, Dad!

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.800
I tell you, I just ain't going home.

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.560
I don't know what to do,
but I ain't going home.

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.760
It's my poor ma I feel sorry for.

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:28.320
Twenty years of walking on eggshells
living with that asshole.

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:31.520
- Where's your ma?
- I don't know.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.480
She went out for a while.

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.880
- Sleep over. She don't mind.
- What's the matter?

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.080
Nothing.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.200
Take a swig of this.

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.680
She's got high blood pressure,
something like that?

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.000
- Hey, come on.
- No, really.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.880
It ain't exactly high blood pressure.

01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.480
What is it?

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.480
It's an alcoholic kind of thing.

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:08.600
Last night, it got real bad.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:17.080
She checked in to some kind of hospital.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.520
Perry, I'm sorry, man.

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.880
Oh, man, there's nothing to be sorry for.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.720
She's better off.

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:32.520
It's okay, it happened before.
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.000
- I'm taking off.
- What?

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.440
They want me to go back
to Trenton, fucking New Jersey.

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.040
Screw graduating. I've been thinking about
heading out to California anyway.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.480
California?

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.320
That's it.

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.440
Man, that's a great idea.

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.760
- I'm coming with you.
- No, no.

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:03.360
I travel alone.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.080
Besides, I ain't sure I'm going to California.

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.680
Maybe I'll go to China.

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.440
Hey, I was just...

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:19.880
Perry?

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.440
What?

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.040
I'm scared.

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:28.200
Hey, what's wrong with that?

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.760
What do you mean?

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.920
Joey, do me a favor. If we travel together,
you have to promise not to be an asshole.

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:40.520
We'll take off right after
the bachelor party for Richie.

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.960
Tina? Tina?

01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:50.880
- Who's Tina?
- My mom.

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:54.240
- Who the hell is that?
- It's my dad, Emilio.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.840
Tina!

01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.560
Hey, Tina!

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.760
I thought you told your mother
you were going out bowling tonight?

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.920
You've been lying to her or what?

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.360
Don't come near me.

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:22.600
What are you talking about? I want to
know why you weren't home for dinner.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.880
- Don't come near me.
- Leave the kid alone.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.920
Were you talking to me?

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.360
Didn't your father teach you no manners?

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.880
- Leave the kid alone.
- Perry, he'll kill you.

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.560
That's the trouble with you rotten kids.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.640
Your fathers are afraid
to kick some sense into your heads.

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.160
Your father must have been
some kind of piss ant...

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.600
There's no sense of humor.

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.080
Come on, what's all this about?

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:09.600
You shouldn't have done that!
He's your father. Don't forget that.

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:11.640
I think I killed the bastard.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.080
Let's get out of here.

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:15.960
Get out of here!

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:20.760
- What are we going to do?
- Get to my car.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.120
"Hello!"

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.600
Richie! Sex fiend!

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.800
What are you guys doing here?
You're going to get me fired.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.320
- What're you doing? What's going on?
- Tell me, did you sleep with her?

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.240
What else are you going to do with her?

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.480
- Fix your hair.
- Come on, let's go.

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.840
Trouble? Where? With who?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.200
- You're in big trouble.
- You're fine now.

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:55.800
- Okay, I'm coming.
- Come on, let's go.

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.160
- Comb your hair.
- I'll do it.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:26.240
We all chipped in to get you something
for your bachelor party.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.760
Here you go.

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:35.000
- Come on, open it.
- This is something you needed all along.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.040
Dirk, you're my main man.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.760
That's the least we could have done.

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.800
- Come on, open it.
- Would you open the box?

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.200
We're going to be here all night.

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.800
Sometime today, I want to eat.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.520
- What is it?
- Open it.

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.000
One more time.

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.920
Fuck you guys. One lousy rubber.
Thanks a lot, you fucking assholes.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.840
We got you a life-time supply.

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:24.520
- Talk to you later.
- Come on. You just got here.

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.080
We gotta leave.

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.240
Come on. We'll have a little food,
drink a little wine. We'll have a good time.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:34.400
- With all these gold jackets, you know.
- Don't worry about it, man.

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.240
- Let's stay.
- We'll have a good time.

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.920
- We'll hang for a little while.
- Have something to eat.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.240
Watch yourself. Coming through.

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.520
This is from the guys over there.

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.960
Hey, son-in-law.

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:28.440
I was talking with my brothers.
They agreed to bring you in.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.280
It means you're going to do all right.

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.200
This fits real nice.

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.480
You'll grow into it.

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:46.880
Once you're married to my daughter,
you'll never wash another dish in your life.

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.880
Where are you going?

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.840
Just getting some fresh air.
I'll be right back.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.760
Hey, Nina.

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.880
Nina!

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:34.840
Nina, wait a minute...

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:42.000
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I thought you were somebody else.

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.520
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.560
Hey, where are you guys going?

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.640
- We got to be on our way.
- On your way?

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.120
Yeah, we...

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.200
...we just came by to wish you luck.

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:42.560
What're you talking about?
What's going on?

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.480
Hey, Peewee, get out of there.

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:57.400
Come on, Joey. Leave me alone, will you?

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:01.000
Hey, Joey, what're you doing?

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.200
You don't talk without your Baldies.

01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:09.920
Leave me alone.

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.560
Hey, man, you owed me, you big shithead.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.920
Come on, don't cry.

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.480
I'm sorry.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.600
All that time I was with the Baldies...

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.400
...and not one of them even
drops me a card.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.560
Hey.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:41.560
- I'll drop you a card, all right?
- Hey, Joey. Come on, man, let's go.

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.360
Where are you going?

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:49.200
Hey, where do you guys
think you're going?

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.520
- You can't go, man.
- I gotta go.

01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:58.240
But, if you ever need us...

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.040
...just whistle loud. We'll be there.

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.360
You can't do it to me. Fucking little guy.

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.280
Come here.

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.800
Just remember one thing.

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:14.840
Wanderers forever.

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.960
Don't take any wooden pussy.

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:32.240
Hey, come on back, will you, guys?
Come on.

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.360
Come on with me. Everybody's inside.
Quit your fucking crying.

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:44.480
- Thank you so much.
- It was a wonderful evening.

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.200
- I'm glad. Come back.
- Thank you.

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:48.200
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.920
We'll come back and see you soon.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
- Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:56.120
- Is this the guy?
- This is the guy. The man of the hour.

01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:59.040
Ladies and gentlemen,
this young man is getting married...

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:02.360
...and I don't know
what advice we can give him.

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.560
- Don't do it!
- What's your favorite song, Richie?

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.040
- I ain't got one.
- Well, I got one for you.

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:13.080
And I want you all, ladies and gentlemen,
to join in as I sing.

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:21.920
"San Francisco, 2,941 miles."
Do we got enough gas?

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.080
Hey, Joey, do me a favor.

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.760
If we're going to travel together,
you have to promise not to be an asshole.

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.640
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
