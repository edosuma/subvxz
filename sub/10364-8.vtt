Hey, Cool P! What's up?

Tommy, where the fuck are you?
It's time to come home, Tommy.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.200
Your uncle wants you home.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.720
Yeah, listen. Cool.
Tell Uncle Sal I'm happy here.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.600
I'm going to stay for a little while
and see what develops.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.880
What's going to develop

Don't you understand?

Frank was given Norway by the Commission

I'm giving you a last chance to go home.

You're an old man.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.960
Face it, your time has come and gone.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.720

06:44.800 --> 06:47.560
and you're turning
into a nice little farmer.

You're protecting these guys.
You're leaving money on the table, Frank.

you've turned soft and weak.

This is Nurse Line from the hospital.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.480
Well, hi there.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.000
You asked to be informed if there were
any dramatic changes with Dag.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.760
Now, I'm thrilled to tell you there is.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.840
Oh, yes?

Yes. He is actually speaking.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.600
Yes, you heard me.

He is totally coherent.

but it's for employees only.

And even if we did,
we're not allowed to fraternize.

12:31.320 --> 12:32.440
Okay.

And after that incident,
I told myself, "No more lamb."

12:37.040 --> 12:38.760
And I haven't had it ever since.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.720

12:42.800 --> 12:46.120
Yes, but I don't think he's here today.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.400
No, I think he went with Reidun
to her cabin.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.280
Okay.

Great. Remember, walnuts not peanuts.

you help me with a license plate for a...?

at the Flamingo. Make some calls.

Jan's boss has a cabin
somewhere around here.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.120
The problem is that some
don't have proper addresses here.

Hey! Is that the car?

Yes. No, that's impossible.

Yeah, apparently. Hold on. Yes?

No, I'm not having this. Fine!

15:01.960 --> 15:04.680
[sighs heavily]

15:05.680 --> 15:07.600
[in English] How's my favorite pervert?

15:07.680 --> 15:09.440
[in Norwegian] For Christ's sake!

15:09.520 --> 15:11.680
[in English] Don't you start now!

15:11.760 --> 15:13.120
[Sigrid yells]

15:13.200 --> 15:16.200
What? Was it something I said?

15:17.240 --> 15:19.240
[chuckles]

15:20.760 --> 15:23.480
Alex, honey, come over here, babe.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.400
I want you to meet my new driver,
my bodyguard, Roar Dog.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.640
Or maybe you already know each other.

15:32.720 --> 15:37.120
Yeah, yeah.
Actually, we met at the Flamingo.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.920
[Tommy] 'Course you did. The Flamingo.

15:43.160 --> 15:46.720
I bet Roar here
thinks he knows the whole story,

15:46.800 --> 15:49.640
but I can assure you,
he don't know the half.

15:49.720 --> 15:50.800
Let me fill you in.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.280
The man you call Johnny...

15:55.280 --> 15:57.400
His real name is Frank Tagliano.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.160
The Taglianos were three brothers.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.800
Tough guys, all of them, back in the day.
Real killers.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.000
They all grew up in the same neighborhood
as my Uncle Sal.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.000
Frankie, he was the youngest.

16:09.080 --> 16:14.040
Antonino, Tough Tony,
he became Father Tony.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.800
A fucking priest, if you can believe that.

16:16.880 --> 16:21.240
Now the middle brother, Giuseppe,
he was maybe the most vicious of them all.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.840
They had their own little thing,
these three guys.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.080
If Frank the Fixer
couldn't reason with you,

16:27.160 --> 16:29.560
Father Tony
would prepare you for the afterlife,

16:29.640 --> 16:32.440
and Joey the Undertaker
would send you there.

16:32.520 --> 16:37.480
What happened with the middle brother?
The hit man?

16:37.560 --> 16:39.880
[Tommy]  He owns
a funeral parlor in Bay Ridge.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.920
Does a job here or there. Local.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.880
He won't even get on a plane.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.360
These guys, they're fucking dinosaurs.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.080
This is a new world
and they're virtually extinct.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.360
That's why I want to make a toast
to our generation.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.120
- [in Norwegian] Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.760
[Tony in English]
This is the faith of the church.

17:04.840 --> 17:09.800
We are proud to profess it,
in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.480
As we baptize
these three new children of God,

17:16.560 --> 17:21.040
we give thanks to him for bestowing on us
these new wonder drugs

17:21.120 --> 17:26.120
that produce triplets,
quintuplets, whatever,

17:26.200 --> 17:29.040
keeping our church
flourishing into the future.

17:29.120 --> 17:33.840
And we continue to thank him
for being born with the right religion,

17:33.920 --> 17:37.920
in the right country, at the right time.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.160
These children will grow up
in a civilized environment,

17:42.240 --> 17:46.160
away from those animals in the Middle East
who continue to kill each other

17:46.240 --> 17:50.120
in the birthplace of our Lord
and Savior, Jesus Christ.

17:53.720 --> 17:57.480
On my knees. I'm too old for this shit.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.240
It's the only place the Facebook Feds
ain't these days.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.120
So talk fast.
My gams ain't getting any younger either.

18:05.480 --> 18:09.000
[sighs] I've made a problem.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.520
For Frankie.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.360
I need to get to Giuseppe to fix it.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.800
You know the way.

18:14.880 --> 18:18.000
And so we begin with little Joey.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.680
I baptize you in the name of the Father

18:22.760 --> 18:25.560
and of the Son...

18:25.640 --> 18:28.840
Yeah, well,
the truth of the matter is, Angelina,

18:28.920 --> 18:30.800
Tony's never really liked me.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.400
Don't take it personal.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.640
Tony don't like nobody but God.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.200
And even with him, it's iffy.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.680
Angelina, please.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.240
It's for Frankie. It's not for me.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.280
And little Annie,

18:44.360 --> 18:50.600
I baptize you in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.160
[Tony] Amen.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.640
All right. I'll see what I can do.

18:55.720 --> 19:00.080
And little Maria, I baptize you
in the name of the Father

19:00.160 --> 19:03.480
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.920
Amen.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.200
And don't forget
you can follow me on Twitter:

19:10.280 --> 19:14.600
@FatherTonys #GodsCrew

19:14.680 --> 19:17.680
Join my mailing list at fathertonys.com

19:17.760 --> 19:20.240
and "like" my fathertonys Facebook page.

19:20.320 --> 19:23.240
With that, go in peace with God.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.320
[organ playing]

19:32.560 --> 19:34.560
[water flowing]

19:51.960 --> 19:54.520
NORWEGIAN AUTOMOBILE MUSEUM

19:58.040 --> 20:02.280
Is this where Norwegian shit
comes to die or what?

20:02.360 --> 20:06.200
You know, this is our heritage.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.320
Have a little respect, man.

20:08.400 --> 20:12.560
[Joey] I'm trying. I'd have a little more
respect, if the friggin' lights worked.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.840
[Roy] The generator
will start in a minute.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.120
She's a beauty, ain't she?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.360
1926 Chandler.

20:33.360 --> 20:36.840
Can't you see big Al Capone
on the running boards?

20:36.920 --> 20:38.920
"This one's for you, Bugsy."

20:39.000 --> 20:41.320
[imitating machine-gun fire]

20:41.400 --> 20:42.720
[chuckles]

20:42.800 --> 20:46.440
Yeah. I can see it, Frankie.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.640
Come here.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.440
What's a big star like you doing
in my little neighborhood?

20:59.520 --> 21:02.320
Frankie, we've got to talk.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.840
All right. Step into my office.

21:09.600 --> 21:14.320
Ever since the book came out,
Uncle Sal's been threatening me.

21:14.400 --> 21:19.880
I thought at first he wasn't serious,
but recent events suggest otherwise.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.480
He says I stole the recipes
for the whole book from his mother.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.360
That's not true.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.120
Joey...

21:29.200 --> 21:31.560
Hello? This is me.

21:31.640 --> 21:35.120
How many Sunday dinners did we have
at Nana Lento's through the years?

21:36.680 --> 21:39.840
I know where
your anise biscotti cookies came from.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.360
She's the only one
who never double-baked them.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.120
And your secret recipe for pizzaiola?

21:47.200 --> 21:50.720
Using the cheap meat
with the extra fat for the good taste?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.040
Sound familiar?

21:53.360 --> 21:55.160
I'm a fan, Joe.

21:55.240 --> 21:59.880
My chef has your book in our kitchen, but
we all know where it came from. Come on.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.600
Okay. So what?

22:03.680 --> 22:05.240
At least I'm keeping her alive.

22:05.320 --> 22:08.960
What did that cocksucker ever do for her
except put her in an early grave?

22:09.040 --> 22:12.320
And it don't mean he can whack
who the fuck he wants.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.080
What? What do you mean?

22:15.160 --> 22:19.240
Somebody took a shot at me,
coming out of a fucking talk show!

22:19.320 --> 22:22.200
Who else would have the balls?

22:22.280 --> 22:23.640
I got no other beefs going on.

22:23.720 --> 22:27.160
He contracts it out of the country
to keep his hands clean.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.040
So now I do some research

22:31.120 --> 22:33.760
and find out
there's only two operations happening

22:33.840 --> 22:35.720
in this whole fucking part of the world:

22:35.800 --> 22:38.960
you and his  strunz  of a nephew
a few towns away.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.000
You know I'm semi-retired here.
You know that, Joe.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.520
I know it ain't you, Frankie,
or else I wouldn't be here.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.520
I also know you patched things up
with the Commission

22:49.600 --> 22:52.320
and they gave you Scandinavia.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.520
So, out of respect,
before I whack this punk kid,

22:57.600 --> 23:00.280
and then go home
and take care of that rat fuck Sally,

23:00.360 --> 23:03.360
I want your permission to proceed.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.560
Give me 24 hours.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.440
Before we go to war
over Nana Lento's lasagna...

23:16.200 --> 23:18.960
...let me make a few calls
and see what's what.

23:19.040 --> 23:22.200
That's why I come to you, Frankie.

23:22.280 --> 23:25.400
No one was ever better
at conflict resolution than you.

23:26.680 --> 23:31.760
The neighborhood ain't been the same
without Frankie the Fixer.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.040
[glasses clink]

23:33.120 --> 23:35.840
By the way, what talk show was it?

23:36.920 --> 23:39.760
Some Swedish guy. Sassgein or something.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.160
Skavlan.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.880
Oh, yeah, Freddie Skavlan.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.160
Comes to the club all the time.
Plays cards. Good guy.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.240
Graveyards give me the creeps.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.080
That's because you know
you're going to be in one soon.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.560
[Tony chuckles]

23:56.640 --> 24:00.360
And don't say nothing like that
in front of Joey. That's all I'm saying.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.840
Don't worry. I know, I know.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.120
[electric saw buzzing]

24:08.280 --> 24:09.280
[door closes]

24:12.320 --> 24:16.000
Angelina. Anthony. What brings you here?

24:17.320 --> 24:21.000
Ah. Probably you, Sal.

24:22.280 --> 24:25.040
It's our brother. Like always.

24:25.120 --> 24:28.360
[Angelina] He's in trouble again, Joey,
but it's not his fault.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.960
It's my fault.

24:32.040 --> 24:35.920
Scusi , Giuseppe. Could we go
somewhere else to talk, please?

24:37.720 --> 24:39.360
You're not comfortable here?

24:39.440 --> 24:41.400
[stammering] Uh...

24:41.480 --> 24:42.600
No.

24:42.680 --> 24:45.920
It's all right. Come on.
I'll make you some coffee. Follow me.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.240
[birds chirping]

25:06.280 --> 25:08.440
[Sigrid in Norwegian] Hello? Hello?

25:10.360 --> 25:12.360
Oh, my God.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.760
What's going on?

25:19.840 --> 25:21.800
- Hi, honey.
- What are you doing?

25:21.880 --> 25:24.920
I thought we could take a bath together.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.160
- Take a bath?
- [Chris] Yes.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.920
Milk is good for the skin.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.960
Don't you get it?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

25:32.040 --> 25:36.320
You don't get it.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.440
I love you, honey, and we're going
to have children together, but--

25:40.520 --> 25:45.800
Why don't you listen to me?
I don't want to talk to you anymore!

25:45.880 --> 25:47.520
But...

25:49.200 --> 25:50.960
I don't understand!

25:51.040 --> 25:53.480
If you don't want
to talk to me anymore, who will?

25:53.560 --> 25:55.080
Oh, Lord.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.840
[sobs] Everybody hates me!

25:58.920 --> 26:00.080
- No.
- Yes.

26:00.160 --> 26:02.400
- No, they don't.
- Yes.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.120
Listen. Listen to me.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.800
You need to talk to someone, okay?

26:07.880 --> 26:12.080
But the thing is,
I'm not the one to talk to.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.240
- You need help, right?
- Listen.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.840
- What are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up, okay?

26:16.920 --> 26:18.080
- Shut up.
- Let go of me.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.120
- Don't flaunt your breasts like that!
- [Sigrid yells] Let go of me!

26:21.200 --> 26:22.920
- Shut up, you whore!
- Let me go!

26:23.000 --> 26:26.720
If you're going to breast-feed your son,
you might as well breast-feed me!

26:26.800 --> 26:29.800
[screams] I said let go of me! Stop!

26:29.880 --> 26:31.480
[Sigrid yelps]

26:34.680 --> 26:38.400
[Sigrid cries hysterically]

26:58.320 --> 27:00.920
[in English] Okay. This way. It's fresh.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.840
[in Norwegian]
I've got to hand it to you, Torgeir.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.560
This Sherpa idea was brilliant.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.720
Yeah, I know.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.640
- [Torgeir] Can I ask a question?
- [Roy] Yes.

27:09.720 --> 27:13.560
[Torgeir] If the chick you live with
wanted to move away from Lillehammer,

27:13.640 --> 27:15.320
would you go along with that?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.240
That actually did happen
to me recently, Torgeir.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.920
One thing I've learned about women
is that you need to be in charge.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.640
I told my mother, "Hey, Ma.
No way we're moving."

27:28.160 --> 27:30.360
What about you, Roy?

27:31.960 --> 27:34.160
You can find broads anywhere,

27:34.240 --> 27:39.280
but a city within walking range from both
the sea and the mountains is hard to find.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.880
Yeah, I guess you're right.

27:42.960 --> 27:46.600
You know, Reidun,
I could have been an actor.

27:46.680 --> 27:48.640
No!

27:48.720 --> 27:50.800
[chuckles] Yes, it's true.

27:50.880 --> 27:56.040
I was always in the school play.

27:57.760 --> 28:01.400
Never good-looking enough to be the lead.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.800
Stop it.

28:02.880 --> 28:07.320
Even when I was obviously better
than the "cool" boys.

28:07.400 --> 28:10.560
You are full of surprises, Jan.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.480
[both laugh]

28:13.680 --> 28:18.920
One of my favorite monologues
was actually from  A Doll's House,

28:19.000 --> 28:20.680
one of Nora's monologues.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.040
- Why don't you do a scene from it?
- No way.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.160
- Come on.
- No, it's too long.

28:25.240 --> 28:27.720
Just shorten it a bit.
Come on. A short version?

28:27.800 --> 28:29.280
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.680
I'm not sure if I remember how it goes.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
[Jan chuckles nervously]

28:50.000 --> 28:53.360
"I mean that I was simply transferred
from Papa's hands into yours.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.280
You arranged everything
according to your own taste,

28:56.360 --> 29:00.280
and so I got the same tastes as you--
[chuckles] or else I pretended to.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.160
I can't remember anymore.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.520
Maybe it was both.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.000
First one thing, then another.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.560
Torvald...

29:11.280 --> 29:14.360
...when I look at you now,
I see I have been living in poverty,

29:14.440 --> 29:16.720
from day to day.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.200
[Jan sighs]

29:20.480 --> 29:25.960
You and Papa have committed
a great sin against me.

29:26.040 --> 29:30.920
It is your fault
that I have made nothing of my life.

29:38.840 --> 29:41.040
[cries] It's your fault...

29:43.240 --> 29:45.360
...I have made nothing of my life."

29:49.680 --> 29:50.680
What...?

29:58.920 --> 30:00.320
[in English] We've got him.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.400

30:38.600 --> 30:40.440
[Reidun cries out]

30:41.480 --> 30:45.560
[in Norwegian] If it's a robbery,
take what you want and go. Jan, tell them.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.920
[in English] Shut up!

30:48.080 --> 30:51.920
The lady wants to know what it's
all about, Jan. Tell her. Go ahead.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.960
[in Norwegian]
I've done some bad things, Reidun.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.880
Yeah, you've done some fucking bad things!

30:57.960 --> 30:59.840
[in English] Hear that, Reidun?
That's your name?

30:59.920 --> 31:00.960
[in Norwegian] Yes, yes.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.920
[in English] Jan, here, killed two people
that we know of.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.360
And now it's time to pay. Right, Jan?

31:07.440 --> 31:10.880
[in Norwegian]
I've killed two people, Reidun.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.480
I think we've heard enough.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.960
[in English] Which one first, Johnny?

31:16.840 --> 31:19.480
You hear what he just said?
That was a confession.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.960
- [Reidun] Okay.
- You're religious, Reidun?

31:22.040 --> 31:23.720
[in Norwegian] Yes, in a way I am.

31:23.800 --> 31:27.000
[in English] Well, we believe
in biblical justice around here.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.440
An eye for an eye,  capisce?

31:29.520 --> 31:31.600
Okay. I understand.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.160
Look at me.

31:36.600 --> 31:39.360
Say, "This is justice."

31:39.440 --> 31:42.600
This is justice.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.520
Yeah.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.480
[Jan sobs]

31:46.560 --> 31:50.800
All right. Let her go. She won't talk.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.400
[Reidun gasps]

31:59.360 --> 32:00.960
[sobs] Please.

[Johnny sighs]

32:05.520 --> 32:09.400
[sobs] Please, Johnny.

32:09.480 --> 32:10.720
Shut up.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.280
I've got to go.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.120
Take care of him.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.200
[Jan sobs hysterically]

32:22.440 --> 32:23.440
Please.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.680
[in Norwegian] All right, you heard him.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.520
Bring him down to the water.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.320
[cuts ties]

33:15.880 --> 33:17.480
[Dag] Start rowing.

33:40.160 --> 33:43.680
[Jan in English] Hail Mary, full of grace.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.040
The Lord is with thee.

33:48.040 --> 33:51.200
Blessed art thou amongst women

33:51.280 --> 33:54.520
and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.600
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

34:19.080 --> 34:20.800
[crowd whooping]

34:24.640 --> 34:26.520
Thank you, sir.

34:26.600 --> 34:30.920
I don't fly because of
those friggin' airplane bathrooms.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
You ever been in one?
'Cause obviously I haven't.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.200
[crowd laughing]

34:37.080 --> 34:41.760
[comedian] I got claustrophobia,
agoraphobia, hydrophobia, acrophobia...

34:43.880 --> 34:46.960
- What's up?
- Hope you don't have any bad news for me.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.320
'Cause I've been popping
paracet all morning.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.240
You know, not much, just...

34:52.240 --> 34:55.960
...thinking about quitting
and moving to Hornindal.

[Garnet Mimms'

34:58.800 --> 35:00.480
What?

35:00.560 --> 35:01.600
Birgitte wants to...

35:01.680 --> 35:02.680
[clears throat]

35:02.760 --> 35:05.800
...move to an alpaca farm...

35:06.800 --> 35:08.240
...in Hornindal, so...

35:10.960 --> 35:12.720
So, I'm thinking that, as well.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.600
Torgeir...

35:18.760 --> 35:21.400
There's really only one way
you resign from this job.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.800
That's horizontally.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.160
Yeah, I know, but...

35:25.240 --> 35:27.200
[in Norwegian] My brother, he...

35:28.520 --> 35:31.360
[in English] My brother is gone and my...

35:31.440 --> 35:36.640
[in Norwegian] My health is slipping
and I'm going to be a dad.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.200
[in English] I need a new start.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.040
Like you did,
when you came to Lillehammer.

35:44.200 --> 35:48.280
I'm sorry, but I cannot accept
your resignation at this time.

35:48.360 --> 35:51.160
We're in the middle of a war.
I need my right-hand man.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.520
But she ain't going to like it.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.720
Broads never understand
a man's relationship to his work.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.160
Forget about it.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.880
She's going to be mad.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.560
We're going way too easy on this fanook.
What's his name? Hundeflossen?

36:11.640 --> 36:13.280
Anders Tangen.

36:13.360 --> 36:17.320
Anders Tangen. We need to throw that guy
a beat and he's a week late on payments.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.400
Two, actually.

36:18.480 --> 36:22.960
These pricks are walking all over us.
We need to make an example out of someone.

wise guys a bad name.

He's at home.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.920
That's exactly the example
I'm looking for. Let's go.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.040
Hey, I thought we were having
like a private time tonight.

36:36.120 --> 36:39.880
This is business, honey. I'll call you.
Do your nails or something.

I talk a lot with this guy, you see.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.320
I call him my plumber.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.920
I'm keeping my channels open.

[in English] Excuse me.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.680
Am I too late for your session?

37:20.760 --> 37:23.680
No, no, no.
The session will start after this.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.600
You're very welcome to join us.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.360
Oh.

Alex, you're here in this country
for the wrong reasons.

37:39.240 --> 37:43.000
But you're here today for the right ones.

And you know, Alex,
your angel is with you.

- Hurry up and get it all out, sweet tits.
- Okay. I'll be fine.

38:25.160 --> 38:29.480
And open our heart,

38:29.560 --> 38:34.440
your unique angel.

38:34.520 --> 38:40.120
Dare to be vulnerable.

[in English] Alex, you will have
to let the wisdom of your heart

synchronize with your third eye.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.760
[inhales]

39:14.200 --> 39:18.240
Maybe... Maybe there are no angels for me.

Sometimes
when we run away from ourselves...

39:23.800 --> 39:25.600
...our angels

39:25.680 --> 39:28.080
are using a little bit of time...

39:30.000 --> 39:31.760

at the club now and then.

41:36.080 --> 41:39.280
- [in English] It's a strange case.
- What's so strange about it?

41:39.360 --> 41:43.440
It's not every day you find a guy
with a rat in his mouth.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.160

Attention, ladies and gentlemen,

42:41.640 --> 42:44.440
we are closing temporarily
for renovations.

42:44.520 --> 42:48.080
I suggest that
in as orderly a fashion as possible,

42:48.160 --> 42:49.800
you get the fuck out.

Do you even know?

44:14.440 --> 44:18.800
I was just trying to have a little fun
for once in my life.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.560
You don't belong here.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.280
Yeah.

44:24.480 --> 44:25.880
I don't belong anywhere.

Fuck death!

in a paradise like this?

as you grow older.

scramble device on it.

for Christ's sake.

You can't go around whacking guys
for sausage and peppers sandwiches

47:18.600 --> 47:20.040
Well, fuck him!

always left out a few ingredients

47:23.920 --> 47:25.600

47:25.680 --> 47:28.040
So his cookies are not as good.

47:34.040 --> 47:37.880
Sally, listen to me now.

47:37.960 --> 47:40.400
Joey's got an active crew.

47:40.480 --> 47:44.040
He's going after your nephew
and then he's coming for you.

47:44.120 --> 47:48.880
Frankie, I can't control this kid anymore.
It's bad.

47:48.960 --> 47:50.120
[Johnny]  I understand.

47:50.200 --> 47:52.560
But there's only one solution.

47:52.640 --> 47:57.880
I mean, I've got to tell him
that Tommy went rogue.

47:57.960 --> 48:01.720
And you had nothing to do
with the assassination attempt.

48:01.800 --> 48:05.560

sacrificed in order to avoid a war.
