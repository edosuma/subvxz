WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.506
STICKY: Curtain designed the Whisperer
to make us feel loyal.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.967
We have to remember that he's the enemy.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.468
-You're jealous.
-What?

00:10.552 --> 00:13.888
The Whisperer is manipulating your mind,
your emotions.

00:13.972 --> 00:16.057
I know. For the better.

00:16.141 --> 00:18.768
This is all such a blatant disregard

00:18.852 --> 00:20.729
for the safety of Reynie
and his companions.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.564
BENEDICT: We'll exfiltrate the children
at first light.

00:22.647 --> 00:25.525
Right now, we need to focus
on the Farm and the Forest.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.110
Only Executives are allowed
to clean the Server Room.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.778
The Server... Farm?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.405
Yeah. That's what I said.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.866
KATE: You know, if the offer still stands,

00:32.949 --> 00:36.286
I wouldn't mind coming by and checking out
your sweet new room.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.746
I made this for you.

00:39.914 --> 00:40.915
For me?

00:40.999 --> 00:42.584
S.Q.: I'm going to the Forest
with a friend.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.752
This friend of yours,

00:43.835 --> 00:45.253
-do they have a name?
-Reynie.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.130
REYNIE: It's incredible.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.716
Those aren't real trees.
What are they for?

00:49.799 --> 00:52.052
I don't know,
but he says once they're turned on,

00:52.135 --> 00:53.678
I have to stay away for a while.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.222
-When is it going to be turned on?
-Twenty-two hours from now.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.731
CURTAIN: That's the one.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.567
CONSTANCE: Blue berets on everyone.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.861
REYNIE: They're not subliminal
suggestions anymore.

01:09.944 --> 01:10.904
They're commands.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.572
Textbook mind control.

01:12.655 --> 01:13.782
Let's go. Right now.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.451
Wait. We could put good thoughts
into people's heads.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.577
You're not thinking straight.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.329
I'm the only one here who is thinking!

01:19.412 --> 01:21.664
You wanna hash things out? Go ahead.
I've got work to do.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.667
REYNIE: Kate! Wait! You can't do it alone!

02:38.950 --> 02:40.118
You're still here?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.912
SCIENTIST: I have to calibrate
the power actuator.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.455
Well, go get some shut-eye.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.083
You'll need your rest for tomorrow.
We're all systems go.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.318
What the...

03:16.863 --> 03:18.156
I'll take row A.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.742
You had A last time. You can do B.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.785
-I have a special feel for A.
-They're identical.

03:22.869 --> 03:26.039
-Then why do you care?
-Variety. Monotony is soul-crushing.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.125
JACKSON: I don't think we've come
to a consensus on that.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.627
JILLSON: No, it's been determined.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.546
JACKSON: Why do we have
to dust the Server Room?

03:33.630 --> 03:36.174
JILLSON: Use it as an opportunity
for quiet reflection.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.594
Really seems like something
the Helpers should be doing.

03:39.677 --> 03:42.555
Dr. Curtain only trusts Executives
in the Server Room.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.890
You should feel honored.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.683
JACKSON: I am.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.518
So honored.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.897
-Let's really get into the vents.
-Filth. Filthy.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.608
-Total dust traps.
-Especially this one.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.520
I think the rats are back.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.772
Maintenance just exterminated.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.357
They're resilient creatures.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.069
Call it in. Tell them to fog it this time.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.445
Max density.

04:39.862 --> 04:40.947
No mercy.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.748
Not a rat.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.459
Intruder.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.129
Intruder!

06:07.200 --> 06:09.035
BENEDICT: Oh, come on.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.790
Still no sign?

06:13.873 --> 06:16.918
No. Nothing but Institute patrol boats.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.128
I'm beginning to think
something terrible has happened.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.880
RHONDA: Given his memory challenges,

06:20.963 --> 06:24.300
it's possible he just forgot
to paint the rock.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.344
Oh. I admire your optimism,

06:26.427 --> 06:29.514
but it's only Milligan's long-term memory
that's hampered.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.641
His short-term memory is spectacular.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.184
He would never forget to signal us.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.436
Well, perhaps he encountered
one of their boats

06:35.520 --> 06:37.814
-and was forced to remain submerged.
-Hmm.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.440
That's a plausible theory.

06:39.774 --> 06:40.858
I buy it.

06:42.318 --> 06:45.071
I completely... buy it.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.075
What is it?

06:54.455 --> 06:55.832
Milligan...

07:40.877 --> 07:43.045
The South and East egress points
haven't been accessed.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.380
The intake vent's right here.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.673
This is the only other way out.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.604
MCCABE: Someone was in this vent.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.189
VAN HORN: Let's get a team out here.

08:07.695 --> 08:08.863
REYNIE: Sticky!

08:09.780 --> 08:10.865
Sticky!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.576
Wake up!

08:14.702 --> 08:15.870
Huh?

08:15.953 --> 08:17.663
-What time is it?
-REYNIE: I don't know.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.248
We've been too busy
looking for Kate all night.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.168
While you've been busy
dreaming of premium steak.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.337
How did you know that?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.422
Kate still hasn't come back to her room.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.342
She's a lone wolf. Always has been.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.594
I gotta get ready.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.429
I might have Whisperer duty later.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.181
Listen to you.

08:35.264 --> 08:38.184
The Whisperer's more important to you
than your friend's safety?

08:38.601 --> 08:41.229
Jumping to conclusions
is a failure of character.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.941
REYNIE: What? That's exactly like
something Curtain would say.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.317
Right from the quotebook.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.277
You guys are stressing out about nothing.

08:48.569 --> 08:49.820
About nothing?

08:49.904 --> 08:52.823
Kate is in danger, Sticky. Real danger.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.033
And you helped put her there.

09:00.581 --> 09:03.292
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.337
Don't apologize. I like this side of you.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.048
The Whisperer's changed you, Sticky.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.968
The Sticky I know
would be worried sick about Kate.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.638
The truth is,
you're not yourself right now.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.014
How would you know?

09:17.098 --> 09:19.976
Because I know you. And I care about you.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.353
If you cared about me,
you'd want me to be happy.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.147
Instead of standing there
and telling me who I am.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.319
I'm your friend. Your best friend.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.905
So I'm supposed to be the one
to remind you who you are.

09:33.656 --> 09:37.618
And that's thoughtful,
and selfless and caring.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.662
I want that Sticky back.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.164
Reynie, I'm your friend too.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.709
I've just learned not to worry so much.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.670
I'm telling you. Kate's fine.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.636
Then we're going to go look
for her ourselves.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.138
You can't. You'll miss breakfast.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.390
We don't care about breakfast.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.767
They'll notice.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.945
SECURITY: Five, 18, 18.7.

10:13.070 --> 10:17.033
I'm getting a three-quarter wave
on the B spectrum, 18.70.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.665
VAN HORN:
We gotta get back to headquarters.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.292
-We've been out here all night.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.852
Investigation done at Delta.
Moving to Echo. Over.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.562
Wrap it up!

10:54.945 --> 10:56.030
Finally.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.797
Grappling hook. Nylon rope...

11:12.880 --> 11:13.798
No!

11:34.985 --> 11:37.113
Milligan may be the strongest man
I've ever met,

11:37.196 --> 11:38.698
but he was also the gentlest.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.285
I only wish we could have
known him better.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.329
Not could have.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.581
You still can.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.876
We have no reason to believe
he did not make it.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.838
Well, the severed propeller
does give me some pause.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.298
It's sobering.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.760
Well, I have never met
a more competent swimmer.

12:04.223 --> 12:07.184
If anyone could survive
the violent implosion of a submarine,

12:07.268 --> 12:12.231
or the bone-crushing onslaught
of seawater, it's Milligan.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.821
He never fails. He gets there.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.949
Sometimes,
via an inordinately circuitous path.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.118
But he does not give up.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.619
Ever.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.166
Then neither will we.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.625
NUMBER TWO: Good.

12:31.709 --> 12:32.918
We will go rescue him.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.044
What?

12:34.128 --> 12:36.213
Yes. Let's go.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.048
I will be more like him.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.551
I will do whatever it takes,
even if it costs me my own life.

12:40.634 --> 12:41.886
Mr. Benedict, please.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.387
We will depart for the island
as soon as possible.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.847
-That's right.
-NUMBER TWO: How?

12:44.930 --> 12:47.391
Security is impenetrable.
You saw the patrols.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.102
I will bring Milligan back safely.
I will bring them all back.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.022
Mr. Benedict?

12:56.275 --> 12:57.359
You were right.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.237
You were absolutely right.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.032
I never should have doubted you.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.161
What?

13:07.244 --> 13:09.538
How hard can it be? It's an island!

13:09.622 --> 13:11.832
A small island! An islet!

13:12.500 --> 13:14.210
Forensics are running multiple tests.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.836
If the evidence is there,

13:15.920 --> 13:18.714
we will have a positive ID
on a suspect very soon.

13:22.092 --> 13:24.386
I certainly have my own suspicions.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.182
Thank you.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.522
S.Q.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.819
Your friend, Reynard Muldoon...

13:41.111 --> 13:43.906
Yesterday, didn't he ask you
to take him to the Forest?

13:46.367 --> 13:47.493
What are you saying?

13:50.204 --> 13:52.164
Are you saying
Reynie's not actually friends with me?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.458
He's just using me?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.169
Right, who'd be friends
with Shepard Quaid,

13:57.253 --> 13:58.879
unless they were out to get something.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.756
-Couldn't be the conversation...
-Okay.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.467
...or the good time,
this has to be some kind of scam.

14:05.010 --> 14:11.141
Son, with my father hat, I hear your pain,
and it's something I acknowledge.

14:12.768 --> 14:16.856
Now, I'm gonna put on my steward
of this institution hat

14:16.939 --> 14:18.858
and ask you a question, S.Q.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.484
It's a very simple yes or no question,
all right?

14:20.568 --> 14:21.485
What?

14:23.445 --> 14:28.701
Did you or did you not take Reynie
to the Forest?

14:35.916 --> 14:39.044
It's a yes or no. Binary choice.

14:41.755 --> 14:42.756
No.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.301
You told me not to.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.066
Come on.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.742
Come on,
you're Kate "the Great" Wetherall,

15:09.825 --> 15:11.493
the trapeze goddess.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.245
You can do this!

15:37.478 --> 15:38.979
-Milligan?
-I've got you.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.775
Wha...

15:43.233 --> 15:44.360
My bucket.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.737
I dropped my bucket.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.531
It washed into the water.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.950
-I need my bucket!
-Kate. Kate.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.377
Let it go, Kate.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.089
No. No.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.887
KATE: What am I going to do?

16:13.889 --> 16:15.599
The only thing you can...

16:18.352 --> 16:19.728
keep going.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.481
You don't understand.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.484
I think I do.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.323
Where are the others?

16:33.617 --> 16:36.745
Them... I went on this mission alone.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.707
Sometimes, you have to take matters
into your own hands.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.504
Let's just say there was
a bit of internal strife.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.214
It's to be expected.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.759
Sticky has become completely brainwashed
by the Whisperer.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.513
And Reynie is so busy dealing with him,
he's lost sight of why we're even here.

16:54.596 --> 16:58.308
And Constance is...
Constance is Constance.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.645
I couldn't wait for them any longer.
I had to act.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.563
So, I...

17:02.646 --> 17:05.107
Fell off a cliff and nearly died.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.901
MILLIGAN: All alone.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.446
Hmm.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.119
Where did you even come from?
Did you swim all the way here?

17:17.369 --> 17:20.039
I came via submersible most of the way,

17:20.122 --> 17:24.001
but after the collision
and subsequent sinking, yes.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.212
To answer your question,

17:27.296 --> 17:30.841
breaststroke mainly,
intermittent butterfly.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.888
I've come to extract you
and the others from the island.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.475
-Why?
-Orders from Mr. Benedict.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.685
Now? With the Improvement about to start?

17:41.769 --> 17:44.063
With free will on the verge of extinction?

17:44.146 --> 17:46.982
He wants us to just go home
and call it a day?

17:47.066 --> 17:50.110
He has his reasons,
and I'm not here to question them.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.820
I have devised an escape plan.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.865
Can you gather the others
and rendezvous here by nightfall?

17:57.576 --> 17:59.203
Yeah, sure.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.040
Milligan?

18:06.168 --> 18:07.252
Thanks.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.615
This is a bad sign. Really bad.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.660
Let's not jump to conclusions.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.578
Maybe someone lost their wallet.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.625
Hey, Wetherall's widget.
Where's your roommate?

18:47.668 --> 18:49.670
Snoring deeply.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.713
Tell her tetherball practice is canceled.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.842
All Executives are being asked
to join the search.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.928
They didn't have blueberry,
so I brought you one of each kind.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.225
Hmm.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.727
The search for what?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.730
For the criminal who tried to break
into the Server Room.

19:09.815 --> 19:13.068
Poor soul. They are going to pay.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.497
Nothing suspicious here.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.084
Kate...

19:30.460 --> 19:31.587
she's in danger.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.338
Finally.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.926
And it's all because of me.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.184
I messed up so bad.

19:45.976 --> 19:50.189
I could've tried to stop her
or... gone with her.

19:50.814 --> 19:54.026
But... I abandoned her.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.361
I abandoned all of you.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.156
Yes, we know. It's shameful.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.116
STICKY: What happened to me?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.743
The Whisperer happened to you.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.120
REYNIE: It changed you.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.623
Made you into someone you're not.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.292
But the real you won out.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.669
I knew it would.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.508
I just hope Kate's okay.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.220
Kate. She has changed.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.015
Not really.
She has always been who she is.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.643
Her clothes. She changed clothes.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.271
-Kate!
-You're okay!

20:31.355 --> 20:32.606
Not dead after all.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.067
Of course, I'm okay.
Just got a little waylaid, that's all.

20:35.150 --> 20:37.486
I'm starving. What looks good today?

20:39.863 --> 20:41.949
-A cliff?
-What happened?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.200
I was spotted in the vents,

20:43.283 --> 20:45.410
had to Habitrail my way out
and hide on the side of a cliff

20:45.494 --> 20:46.495
until the heat died down.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.747
I am so sorry, Kate.

20:48.830 --> 20:51.500
Don't sweat it. After further review...

20:53.085 --> 20:58.674
it might not have been the best idea
for me to try to go at it alone.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.302
-If it hadn't been for Milligan, I'd...
-REYNIE: Milligan?

21:03.178 --> 21:04.471
-He's come to take us back.
-What?

21:04.554 --> 21:06.431
KATE: Mr. Benedict wants us
to abort the mission.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.100
Failure of will.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.435
Why now? Right when we're making progress?

21:10.519 --> 21:14.189
Yeah, I don't know if I'd call
an all-points bulletin progress.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.025
KATE: Besides, it wasn't exactly up
for discussion.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.735
We're supposed to meet him
back at the beach after dark.

21:20.862 --> 21:24.408
Your undivided attention, please!

21:25.617 --> 21:29.121
Will the following student
please come with me?

21:32.165 --> 21:35.085
Reynard Muldoon.

21:38.213 --> 21:41.258
-How many people are we talking about?
-Yes.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.926
Hundreds.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.052
Oh, my.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.805
Young, old, men, women.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.725
All of them just wearing
these blue berets.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.810
This is deeply troubling.

21:51.893 --> 21:52.894
I'm afraid next time,

21:52.978 --> 21:56.315
my brother's directive
will not be as benign as headwear.

21:57.024 --> 22:01.153
Imagine, he could ask everyone
to mail him a dollar

22:01.236 --> 22:03.363
and become a billionaire
by the end of the week.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.867
That's a best-case scenario.
I shudder to think what he might do next.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.828
It's hard to believe
that the two of you share the same DNA.

22:09.911 --> 22:10.829
Oh.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.206
MS. PERUMAL:
I mean, you seem nothing alike.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.085
I need you to know
that I took your rebuke to heart.

22:17.919 --> 22:21.465
I did. The danger on that island
is far too great for a child.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.759
-I'm bringing them home.
-No, don't.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.303
Don't?

22:29.264 --> 22:30.724
You made the right decision.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.269
That was the only way
to get inside of the Institute.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.563
Okay.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.067
And there's no better leader than Reynie.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.320
Well, yes. But he's only a boy.

22:43.403 --> 22:44.988
Who, given the opportunity,

22:45.072 --> 22:47.532
might be more capable
than all of us combined.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.245
I wrote him a letter.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.374
Just...

22:55.665 --> 22:57.376
A few words of encouragement.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.794
Oh.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.004
Would it be possible to get this to him?

23:03.507 --> 23:05.133
Of course, of course.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.260
BENEDICT: Yes.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.641
I'll find a way.

23:12.724 --> 23:13.767
Hmm.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.105
You're a sly fox, aren't you, Reynard?

23:19.606 --> 23:20.899
Excuse me?

23:21.608 --> 23:23.026
Excuse me.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.487
For what, sir?

23:25.570 --> 23:29.157
Well, as you know,
I'm committed to looking forward.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.785
It's the cornerstone
of my technology for living.

23:31.868 --> 23:37.707
I actually think reflection can be
a crutch, an indulgence, a limiter.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.215
But sometimes, in crisis,

23:45.298 --> 23:48.718
you have to take stock of warning signs
that went unheeded.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.430
They were actually there all along
and I failed to acknowledge them.

23:53.598 --> 23:57.477
And when you didn't mesh well
with the Whisperer,

23:57.561 --> 24:00.397
I just chalked it up
to the vagaries of inexperience.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.899
I had big plans for you, Reynard.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.402
-Limitless plans.
-

24:08.530 --> 24:12.742
But was I blinded
by my wish to see only...

24:12.826 --> 24:14.953
For the love of God, fix that noise!

24:17.372 --> 24:18.790
I'm sorry, Dr. Curtain.

24:18.874 --> 24:22.377
The little things matter.
Every minor detail, it all matters!

24:23.795 --> 24:24.838
I know, sir.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.174
It's the T-S key-hinge.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.925
The new part is on back-order.

24:32.053 --> 24:35.307
Then let's try documenting
the interchange without the T-S key.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.147
Who are you working with?

24:43.106 --> 24:44.774
I'm not working with anyone.

24:45.358 --> 24:47.235
I'm here to learn. That's all.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.363
Oh.

24:50.447 --> 24:53.533
Over the years, I have cultivated
a very special talent, Reynard.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.453
I can tell, with complete accuracy,
when a person is lying.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.622
The syncopated breathing.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.625
The subtle sheen of perspiration
on the forehead.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.668
The darting of the eyes.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.879
The ever so slight dilation of the pupils.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.298
It's as clear as day.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.430
So, I suggest you start with the truth,

25:15.764 --> 25:18.266
continue with the truth,
and end with the truth.

25:20.977 --> 25:23.855
Now, where were you last night

25:23.939 --> 25:26.274
between the hours
of midnight and 7:00 a.m.?

25:27.901 --> 25:30.028
I was sleeping in my room.

25:34.449 --> 25:37.077
Actually, I did get up.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.871
-Once. To go to the bathroom.
-Oh.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.582
I usually try not to look at a clock
when that happens

25:42.666 --> 25:45.293
'cause then I'll wake up too much
and never fall back asleep.

25:45.377 --> 25:50.215
-Hmm.
-But this time, I did. It was 5:47 a.m.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.555
You're a liar, then.

26:00.809 --> 26:05.939
Sustained northwesterly wind speed
of approximately 16 miles per hour.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.148
With gusts up to 20.

26:07.649 --> 26:09.276
Barring a weather shift, we're looking

26:09.359 --> 26:11.945
-at a total travel time in the range of...
-Twenty-two to twenty-four minutes.

26:12.028 --> 26:12.946
One way.

26:13.905 --> 26:14.948
Right on the money.

26:15.323 --> 26:18.493
Let's hope so.
Any miscalculations could mean the end.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.079
And there's no guarantee of a quick
or merciful death, either.

26:21.162 --> 26:24.416
There's riptides, razor reefs,
shark population.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.670
The children would be stranded,
scarred emotionally by our passing.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.256
Of course, they'd see it
as yet another abandonment,

26:31.339 --> 26:33.091
if they even survive long enough
to learn of it.

26:33.174 --> 26:35.635
-This is just...
-You're catastrophizing.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.390
Yes, I am. Quite severely.

26:40.473 --> 26:41.558
Thank you.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.938
Now, once Rhonda arrives back
with additional supplies,

26:47.022 --> 26:50.692
we will begin construction immediately
in hopes of a departure this evening.

26:50.775 --> 26:53.153
-This evening?
-Milligan and the children need us.

26:53.236 --> 26:55.196
Granted, it's a bit tight,
but it's certainly not impossible.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.328
Well, I suppose we should find
a new home for her now.

27:02.037 --> 27:07.292
Oh. I'd think she'd like what all
living creatures yearn for... freedom.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.919
I just hope she can fend for herself.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.547
She's a falcon.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.591
Nature's perfect killing machine.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.346
-Hmm.
-

27:19.429 --> 27:21.222
I'm just sorry she let you down.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.474
BENEDICT: Oh, don't be.

27:22.557 --> 27:25.310
She is who she is, special in her own way.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.395
-

27:27.479 --> 27:29.147
-Oh.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.565
Oh, the letter!

27:30.899 --> 27:31.983
Ooh.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.819
-

27:34.903 --> 27:36.237
Oh, no, no.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.906
-Stand back!
-No. What are you doing?

27:37.989 --> 27:39.532
Aiming for the letter.
I would never hurt a falcon.

27:39.616 --> 27:40.992
No, leave her be. Leave her be.

27:42.369 --> 27:45.163
Reynie will see Ms. Perumal
soon enough with his own eyes.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.249
If all goes well.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.722
Okay, fine.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.433
I'll tell you the truth.

28:08.770 --> 28:11.064
I... did get out of bed.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.565
I left the dormitory.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.861
All right.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.113
And?

28:18.571 --> 28:20.031
The truth is...

28:20.990 --> 28:22.283
I'm homesick.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.828
I miss my teacher from the orphanage.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.747
She was always there for me.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.874
Whenever I couldn't sleep,

28:29.958 --> 28:33.962
she'd take me outside and quiz me
on the constellations till I got sleepy.

28:34.838 --> 28:39.843
So, last night, when I couldn't sleep,
I went outside and looked at the stars.

28:42.762 --> 28:44.431
Well...

28:45.640 --> 28:51.271
I, too, have sought solace
in the dance of the celestial orb.

28:52.689 --> 28:56.109
In fact, I did last night. Tell me.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.777
I can't remember. Um...

28:59.028 --> 29:01.823
What direction of the sky
was Orion's Belt in?

29:05.118 --> 29:06.578
Uh...

29:09.164 --> 29:10.290
I...

29:10.665 --> 29:15.211
Well, which direction was I facing?
I think it was...

29:20.592 --> 29:21.843
The forensics are in.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.095
We've got a positive ID on the intruder.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.725
So do I.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.561
Sir, it's not the boy.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.322
KATE: He just let you go? That's it?

29:42.405 --> 29:43.531
STICKY: Maybe it's a trick.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.533
-Are you being tailed?
-REYNIE: It's not a trick.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.870
Curtain's investigators analyzed the data.
They know who did it.

29:49.245 --> 29:50.205
That's impossible!

29:50.580 --> 29:53.166
I put glue on my fingertips
to mask my prints.

29:53.249 --> 29:55.919
Kate, it's not you they're after.

29:57.003 --> 29:58.630
It's Martina Crowe.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.550
KATE: The key card...

30:02.884 --> 30:05.053
I didn't even think about it
getting traced back to her.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.346
Martina's annoying.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.223
Justice is served.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.645
Looks like a hawk.

30:13.728 --> 30:14.687
CONSTANCE: No.

30:16.439 --> 30:17.982
Peregrine falcon.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.526
How do you know that?

30:19.609 --> 30:21.486
One attacked me as a small child.

30:22.111 --> 30:23.279
That's horrifying.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.989
It did not win.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.409
There's something in its talons.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.871
I knew Mr. Benedict would figure out
a new way to communicate with us.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.832
Is a falcon even a messenger bird?

30:34.123 --> 30:35.667
STICKY: Be careful when it lands.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.669
Their beaks are designed
to rip apart flesh.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.338
So, we dance again...

30:44.133 --> 30:45.385
REYNIE: Where is it going?

30:46.427 --> 30:48.054
-Oh, no.
-We have to find that bird.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.472
REYNIE: Split up. Go!

31:39.856 --> 31:43.192
I know we're already pretty far along,
but I'm curious...

31:43.276 --> 31:45.361
You've built one of these before, right?

31:46.321 --> 31:47.488
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.824
Just never one quite this large.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.201
Was it functional?

31:53.661 --> 31:56.497
Well, I suppose that depends
on how you define functionality.

32:03.296 --> 32:06.090
KATE: Falcon. Falcon.

32:06.841 --> 32:07.800
Falcon.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.302
-

32:09.802 --> 32:11.262
-Martina?
-

32:11.554 --> 32:14.182
I need your help. I've been framed.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.852
You're the only one I can trust.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.998
-

33:07.902 --> 33:09.028
There you are!

33:10.488 --> 33:11.364
Wait.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.450
-Where's the...
-Looking for this?

33:17.578 --> 33:20.039
You go around acting like
you're the nicest kid in school...

33:20.873 --> 33:24.168
But you're not. You're not nice at all.

33:24.335 --> 33:27.463
-S.Q...
-Don't talk anymore. Let's go.

33:27.839 --> 33:28.756
Where?

33:29.340 --> 33:30.466
To see my father.

33:35.596 --> 33:38.266
All units are engaged
in a multi-tiered sweep.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.977
We've got six quadrants
with two sub-quadrants

33:41.060 --> 33:43.563
under each quadrant,
totaling 12 quadrants.

33:43.646 --> 33:46.524
If she's still on the island,
we'll find her, sir.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.900
That's great.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.027
But I have an idea.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.405
How about less words and more finding? Go!

33:53.656 --> 33:55.283
-

33:57.493 --> 33:58.619
What is it, Garrison?

33:58.703 --> 34:01.122
We're about to commence
the calibration signal.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.624
-Fine.
-Do I have your permission to proceed?

34:03.708 --> 34:04.917
Of course, you have my permission.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.962
The last thing I said was,
"Send the calibration signal."

34:08.046 --> 34:09.464
That's a very clear sentence.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.049
Well, I thought,
given the security lockdown,

34:11.132 --> 34:14.052
-that you might want to delay the...
-No. No delay.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.345
We are a go. Now!

34:19.348 --> 34:20.558
It's a go.

34:30.151 --> 34:35.531
Commencing calibration tone
in three, two, one.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.410
DR. GARRISON: Sine wave cohesion?

34:39.494 --> 34:41.746
Thirty-two millihertz variance
and closing.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.957
Pulse threshold penetration?

34:45.041 --> 34:46.584
SCIENTIST: On the rise, Doctor.

34:48.836 --> 34:52.465
You really expect me to believe
my Dad orchestrated the Emergency?

34:52.548 --> 34:55.134
By broadcasting subliminal messages?

34:55.218 --> 34:58.346
Yes. And now he's gonna plant thoughts
in people's heads.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.264
Make them do everything he says.

35:01.015 --> 35:02.517
REYNIE: S.Q., stop.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.521
I'm sorry I lied to you.

35:07.438 --> 35:10.650
Really. It goes against everything I am.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.360
There was no other way.

35:12.443 --> 35:13.820
Our free will is at stake.

35:13.903 --> 35:14.987
Why would I believe you now?

35:15.071 --> 35:17.990
Because it's the truth.
The absolute truth.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.284
I'll let my dad decide. Come on.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.912
If you bring me to your dad,
he's going to erase my memory.

35:22.995 --> 35:24.747
Just like he's done with all the Helpers.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.166
S.Q.: What?

35:27.834 --> 35:28.960
I recognized one of them.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.587
He was an inspector
at the orphanage I came from.

35:31.879 --> 35:34.298
He doesn't even know
his real name anymore.

35:34.841 --> 35:38.386
Don't you find it strange
that none of them have any pasts?

35:45.768 --> 35:48.980
Look, I know this is a lot
for you to process.

35:50.273 --> 35:53.192
I mean, you grew up
with him your whole life.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.194
Just go. Get out of here.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.409
Are you going to tell your dad?

36:27.685 --> 36:30.104
KATE: You should be safe out here.
I made sure to cover my tracks.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.818
Whoever did this to me,
they are gonna pay.

36:37.361 --> 36:41.115
How do you know anyone did anything?
Could just be a case of mistaken identity.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.283
No way.

36:42.658 --> 36:45.953
Someone used my card data.
They singled me out.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.791
There are so many suspects,
I don't even know where to start.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.377
What do you mean?
I thought everyone loves you.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.506
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.

36:57.882 --> 37:01.344
Sure, they admire me.
But they're all jealous of me.

37:01.969 --> 37:05.014
And who can blame them?
It's not easy standing in my shadow.

37:05.806 --> 37:08.643
I've had that problem my entire life.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.604
Everyone just waiting for a chance
to take me down.

37:12.730 --> 37:13.773
Wow.

37:13.856 --> 37:17.026
Willa Graag? Yeah.
She'd love to be captain of the team.

37:17.109 --> 37:19.195
Michael Hoover, Bianca Spirelli...

37:19.278 --> 37:22.615
I hear what people say about me
when they don't think I'm listening.

37:24.283 --> 37:27.995
Do you realize you're the first person
in this entire school

37:28.079 --> 37:30.790
that's actually been nice to me?

37:31.832 --> 37:32.917
MARTINA: It's true.

37:34.627 --> 37:38.047
You're just passionate
about what you believe in.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.383
Some people are intimidated by that.

37:40.466 --> 37:41.676
I think it's awesome.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.595
Yeah. I know you do.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.018
Yeah. So, I should get back.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.272
-Grab you some food and supplies.
-You're the best.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.025
Here. Give me one of your hair clips.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.404
I can plant it on the other side
of the island to throw off the search.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.364
Smart.

38:03.698 --> 38:04.782
Thank you.

38:09.161 --> 38:10.538
It's the least I can do.

38:10.621 --> 38:13.874
After all, you helped me
when I was about to get barged and...

38:18.087 --> 38:20.381
I don't know
what I'd do without you, Wetherall.

38:36.230 --> 38:37.690
MS. PERUMAL: "Dear Reynie.

38:37.773 --> 38:40.776
I pray this letter
finds you safe and unharmed.

38:41.861 --> 38:44.613
I've been made aware
of the dangerous mission you're on,

38:44.697 --> 38:48.451
and worry doesn't even begin
to describe my state of mind.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.371
I can only imagine
how difficult it is for you...

38:53.414 --> 38:57.001
being undercover,
pretending to be someone you're not.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.003
Not to mention, how...

39:00.046 --> 39:01.964
how frightened you must be.

39:04.216 --> 39:06.218
You may be doubting yourself.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.471
You do that sometimes.

39:09.764 --> 39:13.267
Just know that I share
none of your doubts.

39:16.187 --> 39:21.025
If anyone has what it takes to do this,
it's you, Reynie.

39:21.901 --> 39:24.236
I'm immensely proud of you...

39:25.321 --> 39:27.656
and await your safe return.

39:29.450 --> 39:34.663
Your teacher and friend, Miss Perumal."

39:40.127 --> 39:41.337
-

39:41.754 --> 39:42.880
There you are!

39:43.422 --> 39:45.466
Is that the letter? You found the falcon!

39:48.302 --> 39:49.804
That should be a good thing.

39:50.846 --> 39:51.806
What am I missing?

39:54.934 --> 39:57.311
CURTAIN: Your search is a travesty.

39:59.146 --> 40:00.356
Is the girl invisible?

40:01.232 --> 40:03.442
We're redoubling our efforts.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.693
Search matrices have been updated

40:04.777 --> 40:06.779
-and we're running multiple...
-Stop with the words! Stop it!

40:08.114 --> 40:10.741
And just find her.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.410
Sir.

40:16.789 --> 40:17.832
What is it?

40:18.582 --> 40:20.501
Can I talk to you for a second?

40:23.921 --> 40:24.964
Of course.

40:28.342 --> 40:30.970
Always have time for my son.

40:32.388 --> 40:36.225
What are those antennas for?
In the forest?

40:37.226 --> 40:39.019
-Why do you ask?
-Well, I...

40:39.103 --> 40:41.397
You've never expressed any interest
in my work before.

40:41.480 --> 40:45.734
Did something pique your interest?
Or someone?

40:47.987 --> 40:50.614
I don't know. I guess I'm just curious.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.074
Oh.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.744
There's that word again. Curious.

40:57.371 --> 41:00.291
Would you care to reconsider
that answer, son?

41:01.375 --> 41:02.251
No.

41:05.421 --> 41:06.589
That's unexpected.

41:10.926 --> 41:14.680
I'm under a bit of stress at the moment,
and it's clouding my mind

41:14.763 --> 41:18.809
and making it very difficult
to reconcile the timing

41:18.893 --> 41:20.144
and nature of your question

41:20.227 --> 41:22.563
with your denial
that there is anything at all behind it.

41:23.022 --> 41:26.066
So, I think the most prudent thing to do
would be to ask you to leave, please.

41:28.235 --> 41:29.236
Now.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.291
I always knew there was something off
about that girl.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.001
But espionage?

41:44.084 --> 41:47.505
How do you so convincingly fake
a tetherball obsession?

41:47.588 --> 41:48.797
It's sociopathic.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.342
Whoa. Look at that.

41:53.135 --> 41:55.012
Never seen a falcon here.

41:55.471 --> 41:56.722
Fastest animal on Earth.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.849
When diving, I'm told.

42:00.392 --> 42:01.769
Do they even fly at night?

42:03.062 --> 42:04.563
This one does.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.071
Hmm.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.159
I haven't seen him this focused

42:17.243 --> 42:19.578
since the Reykjavik
Neuroengineering symposium.

42:19.662 --> 42:20.663
Hmm.

42:21.789 --> 42:24.333
I still have a cassette of his talk.

42:24.792 --> 42:28.212
Feels good to have
the old Benedict back, doesn't it?

42:39.890 --> 42:41.058
Dr. Curtain?

42:41.141 --> 42:42.184
It couldn't be.

42:45.312 --> 42:46.855
He looks so much like him.

42:47.856 --> 42:50.067
Bit chunkier. Hairier.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.860
We have to report this.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.699
Let's go. Before the night patrols.

42:56.782 --> 42:58.033
Milligan's waiting.

42:58.117 --> 43:00.202
Once we ship off,
we'll pick up Martina on the north coast,

43:00.286 --> 43:01.745
then recon with Mr. Benedict.

43:01.829 --> 43:04.373
Martina is a waste of space and time.
Leave her.

43:04.456 --> 43:06.792
I know she's annoying. Sometimes mean.

43:06.875 --> 43:09.753
But she doesn't deserve the brain sweeper.

43:09.837 --> 43:10.879
Not because of us.

43:10.963 --> 43:12.506
Guilt is for the weak.

43:14.383 --> 43:15.843
I gotta do the right thing.

43:21.807 --> 43:23.017
So do I.

43:24.643 --> 43:26.687
You guys, I can't leave now.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.316
If we walk away,
we're basically allowing Curtain

43:30.399 --> 43:33.319
to control everyone's thoughts,
including our own.

43:33.402 --> 43:36.739
Mr. Benedict wouldn't pull us out
unless he had a good reason.

43:36.822 --> 43:40.659
I know. And if you guys want to leave,
I completely understand.

43:41.827 --> 43:46.081
But I want to stay
and try to finish what we started.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.675
I definitely don't like to leave
anything unfinished.

43:56.759 --> 43:58.385
That's true, I've seen you eat.

44:00.554 --> 44:03.474
And I'm finally on the inside.

44:03.557 --> 44:05.184
I've got good access to Dr. Curtain.

44:07.186 --> 44:09.229
I know we can do this, you guys.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.231
I'm not going anywhere.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.067
Neither am I.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.865
Well, you can't succeed without me, so...

44:33.212 --> 44:37.091
I figured this might happen.
You all want to stay.

44:41.553 --> 44:43.430
Would you mind helping me down, please?

44:43.931 --> 44:45.182
I'm stuck.

44:51.647 --> 44:54.400
You were harried, being pursued.

44:55.526 --> 44:59.196
They were closing in,
no time for the usual precautions...

45:00.447 --> 45:02.074
so you dove towards the cliff.

45:02.157 --> 45:04.368
-

45:06.245 --> 45:07.830
And when you jumped down...

45:08.664 --> 45:12.376
anything in your pockets
could come dislodged.

45:25.514 --> 45:27.474
Wetherall.

45:29.059 --> 45:30.811
What do you mean, he looked like me?

45:30.894 --> 45:32.312
I would describe it as...

45:32.396 --> 45:34.314
-Identical.
-Virtually identical.

45:34.398 --> 45:35.524
But you're in superior shape.

45:35.607 --> 45:37.443
Better grooming, all told.
Better comportment.

45:37.526 --> 45:38.986
The subject had unfashionable attire.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.612
The clothes of someone who had given up.

45:40.696 --> 45:41.780
Enough.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.576
Give me the exact location.

45:54.209 --> 45:55.961
-SECURITY 1: Yes, sir.
-SECURITY 2: Okay.

46:01.383 --> 46:03.427
MCCABE: Let's go. Go, go, go!

46:06.972 --> 46:08.056
Clear.

46:11.101 --> 46:12.269
SECURITY 3: See anything?

46:25.532 --> 46:26.992
Oh, my goodness.
