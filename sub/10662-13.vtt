00:00.125 --> 00:01.593
The Carmichael Show is recorded

00:01.593 --> 00:03.239
in front of a live studio audience.

00:03.240 --> 00:06.000
Ugh! Why is Donald Trump
even in North Carolina?

00:06.001 --> 00:07.962
Hey, Maxine, can you turn
that down for a minute?

00:07.963 --> 00:09.067
I got to ask you something.

00:09.068 --> 00:10.799
Why are people even going to his rally?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.801
It's-it makes me want
to move to another state.

00:12.802 --> 00:14.336
- Maxine.
- What?!

00:14.337 --> 00:17.255
Sorry, it was just my
outrage for Trump talking.

00:17.256 --> 00:18.590
What were you asking me?

00:18.591 --> 00:20.357
We got any more orange juice?

00:22.248 --> 00:23.929
Seriously? That's what
you're gonna ask me?

00:23.930 --> 00:25.263
Just check the fridge.

00:25.264 --> 00:26.598
Uh, okay.

00:26.599 --> 00:28.934
Oh, also I was gonna ask...

00:28.935 --> 00:31.419
what do you think about me
asking you to marry me?

00:32.604 --> 00:34.189
Wait, what?

00:34.190 --> 00:35.524
What-what are you saying?

00:35.525 --> 00:36.858
Are you proposing to me?

00:36.859 --> 00:40.211
Maxine, you got the kind with the pulp!

00:42.031 --> 00:44.616
I mean, if I wanted chunks in my
juice, I'd just eat an orange.

00:44.617 --> 00:46.618
Okay, Jerrod, Jerrod, wait, focus.

00:46.619 --> 00:48.503
Did you just ask me to marry you?

00:48.504 --> 00:50.372
What? Oh, well, no, no.

00:50.373 --> 00:51.707
No, I mean, not yet.

00:51.708 --> 00:53.041
Um, I'm thinking about it though.

00:53.042 --> 00:54.509
I wanted to talk it through first.

00:54.510 --> 00:56.511
Uh, what do you think?

00:56.512 --> 00:59.435
I mean, I figure we're
not getting any younger,

00:59.436 --> 01:02.050
and this single life was
starting to take its toll on me.

01:02.051 --> 01:03.087
Okay, Jerrod, you're not single.

01:03.088 --> 01:05.387
- We've been together for two years.
- Look, Maxine.

01:05.388 --> 01:07.055
Either you're married or you're single.

01:07.056 --> 01:09.057
I've never seen a box on a W-2

01:09.058 --> 01:11.492
that asks if I had strong
feelings for someone.

01:13.563 --> 01:15.564
(scoffs) Did you drink
all the orange juice?

01:15.565 --> 01:17.899
Wait, seriously, we're-we're
having a moment right now,

01:17.900 --> 01:19.568
and you're gonna talk
about orange juice?

01:19.569 --> 01:21.069
- Look...
- What's going on?

01:21.070 --> 01:23.739
Maxine, don't worry about
the semantics of the moment.

01:23.740 --> 01:25.407
I love you.

01:25.408 --> 01:27.743
And marriage is on the table.

01:27.744 --> 01:29.643
So what up?

01:31.497 --> 01:33.165
Well, I love you too.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.834
But I haven't heard you
actually ask me anything,

01:35.835 --> 01:37.335
so...

01:37.336 --> 01:39.504
what up?

01:39.505 --> 01:41.473
Look...

01:41.474 --> 01:43.574
girl...

01:44.927 --> 01:46.595
When we first met,

01:46.596 --> 01:49.264
all I wanted to do was
have sex with you.

01:49.265 --> 01:51.266
And I thought that was it.

01:51.267 --> 01:52.833
But then we had sex.

01:52.834 --> 01:55.187
And I couldn't stop thinking
about you, and I was like,

01:55.188 --> 01:57.522
"Man, why can't I stop
thinking about this girl?"

01:57.523 --> 01:59.191
And that's when I knew.

01:59.192 --> 02:01.526
'Cause that's what love is, Maxine...

02:01.527 --> 02:05.346
when you finish, but
you still want to stay.

02:09.535 --> 02:11.870
Was that you asking me?

02:11.871 --> 02:13.205
Yeah.

02:13.206 --> 02:14.873
So again...

02:14.874 --> 02:16.425
what up?

02:16.426 --> 02:20.429
Uh, well...

02:20.430 --> 02:22.130
I guess I'm in?

02:22.131 --> 02:23.265
Yeah? Cool.

02:23.266 --> 02:24.448
Yeah.

02:26.219 --> 02:30.704
Wow. Well, I can't wait to tell
my friends this touching story.

02:32.275 --> 02:34.609
All right, well, look,
don't say anything.

02:34.610 --> 02:36.228
We got to break the
news to my mom first.

02:36.229 --> 02:37.229
This what we're gonna do.

02:37.230 --> 02:38.966
You got to bring her in
early, make her feel

02:38.967 --> 02:41.149
like she's a part of the
decision-making process.

02:41.150 --> 02:42.471
That's how you manipulate people.

02:42.472 --> 02:43.472
You got a lot to learn.

02:43.473 --> 02:44.619
Wait.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.637
Hold on. You and I
just had a conversation

02:46.638 --> 02:48.212
about marriage without you actually

02:48.213 --> 02:49.546
asking me to marry you.

02:49.547 --> 02:51.076
You just did that same thing to me.

02:51.077 --> 02:53.662
I know, and it worked. See?

02:53.663 --> 02:57.132
You said yes, so let's go
manipulate my mom together.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.584
I love you, baby.

How long does it take?

03:47.516 --> 03:48.716
We got something to tell you.

03:48.717 --> 03:50.751
He'll stare in those cases for hours.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.387
He says seeing all those
slaughtered animals

03:53.388 --> 03:57.356
reminds him of man's
dominance on the Earth.

03:58.593 --> 04:01.528

all these animals would kill

Children, gather round!

04:17.946 --> 04:19.769
Where's your mama? I need
her to gather round.

04:19.769 --> 04:20.898
Cynthia, gather round!

04:20.899 --> 04:21.899
I got a story!

04:21.899 --> 04:24.868
CYNTHIA: I'm here, Joe.

04:24.869 --> 04:27.187
Well, come on, gather round.

04:27.188 --> 04:29.823
All right, today I had

04:29.824 --> 04:33.661
a truly once-in-a-lifetime
experience at the butcher shop.

04:33.662 --> 04:37.715
I was perusing the fine meats...
which reminded me

04:37.716 --> 04:41.068
of my dominance over all
the beasts in the field...

04:41.069 --> 04:43.704
and this... this man,
he came to me in a navy suit,

04:43.705 --> 04:46.640
and he asked me: would I like
to shake Donald Trump's hand?

04:46.641 --> 04:48.864
Oh, God. Please don't say you
shook Donald Trump's hand.

04:48.865 --> 04:50.444
Wait, you don't know what happens.

04:50.445 --> 04:51.944
Nah, she's right, I did.

04:53.515 --> 04:55.165
I shook Donald Trump's hand.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.485
You ruined a perfectly
good "gather round."

04:58.486 --> 05:01.472
Wait a minute, are you sure
it was Donald Trump, Dad?

05:01.473 --> 05:04.658
You know how you guys get
middle-aged white men mixed up.

05:04.659 --> 05:06.977
I don't care what you say, Jerrod.

05:06.978 --> 05:10.730
That was Kurt Russell at that car wash.

05:15.603 --> 05:16.920
Yeah, it was Trump all right.

05:16.921 --> 05:18.222
He's in town for a rally,

05:18.223 --> 05:20.557
and he was popping in to
some of the local businesses

05:20.558 --> 05:22.209
trying to meet real Americans.

05:22.210 --> 05:25.429
We all know ain't nobody
more real and more American

05:25.430 --> 05:27.263
than Joe Carmichael.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.884
Here's a picture of us in
front of the veal cutlets.

05:32.787 --> 05:34.438
Wow.

05:34.439 --> 05:36.740
How could you allow yourself
to get used like that, Joe?

05:36.741 --> 05:39.226
This is obviously just a
photo op for his campaign.

05:39.227 --> 05:40.440
He wants it to look

05:40.441 --> 05:42.264
like black people would
actually vote for him.

05:42.265 --> 05:44.264
Maxine, you got to understand
something about me.

05:44.265 --> 05:46.200
I don't vote by race.

05:46.201 --> 05:47.901
I don't vote by party.

05:47.902 --> 05:50.537
I just look at the candidates,
and I pick the one

05:50.538 --> 05:52.489
that I think's gonna
make the best president.

05:52.490 --> 05:57.293
Joe Carmichael is making
America great again.

05:59.998 --> 06:02.015
Joe, you cannot vote for Trump.

06:02.016 --> 06:03.634
No Trump. Never Trump.

06:03.635 --> 06:04.952
He's just... (laughs)

06:04.953 --> 06:06.286
I just...

06:06.287 --> 06:08.922
I can't.

06:08.923 --> 06:10.240
Why?

06:10.241 --> 06:13.210
Okay, all right, Maxine, just breathe.

06:13.211 --> 06:15.195
Uh, please just tell me you're joking.

06:15.196 --> 06:17.548
No, I don't joke about voting,
and I vote for everything.

06:17.549 --> 06:21.250
Even comptroller, and I don't
even know what that is.

06:22.637 --> 06:25.439
But I do know I don't like the
job that Tommy Liu is doing.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.508
Oh, don't get me started on Tommy Liu.

06:27.509 --> 06:30.494
It's like he's not even
trying to "comptrol."

06:30.495 --> 06:31.856
Okay, well, if we can stop talking

06:31.857 --> 06:33.141
about politics for one minute...

06:33.142 --> 06:36.433
No, no, no, now, there are
two rules in this house.

06:36.434 --> 06:38.786
No voting for Donald Trump,

06:38.787 --> 06:43.222
and no touching my Dove
body wash with microbeads.

06:46.561 --> 06:49.897
Now, Cynthia, I love you,
and I respect you,

06:49.898 --> 06:51.849
but you can't tell me
who I can vote for,

06:51.850 --> 06:54.401
and you can't tell me
not to use your body wash.

06:54.402 --> 06:58.455
You're not the only one up in
here that needs to exfoliate.

06:58.456 --> 07:03.009
Or would you rather I shed
my skin in bed like a snake?

07:04.879 --> 07:07.214
CYNTHIA: Joe. Joe.

07:07.215 --> 07:10.517
Do you really want an orange president

07:10.518 --> 07:12.969
with little tiny baby hands?

07:15.890 --> 07:19.059
Look, we're here because
Maxine and I have some news.

07:19.060 --> 07:20.483
Now what's wrong with being orange?

07:20.484 --> 07:22.696
Why you got to make this racial?

07:22.697 --> 07:25.215
I think he looks like a
beautiful tropical sunset.

07:25.216 --> 07:26.617
(sighs)

07:26.618 --> 07:28.936
Okay, Joe, this man could be
the leader of our country.

07:28.937 --> 07:31.905
The-the fate of the world
could rest in his hands,

07:31.906 --> 07:34.224
and he's talking about building walls

07:34.225 --> 07:36.193
and exporting citizens.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.737
He very well could be the next Hitler.

07:37.738 --> 07:39.463
Well, there it is.

07:39.464 --> 07:42.449
Can we get through one election season

07:42.450 --> 07:44.101
without somebody being called Hitler?

07:44.102 --> 07:46.403
Trump is not Hitler, okay?

07:46.404 --> 07:49.056
You can't get that far
in New York real estate

07:49.057 --> 07:51.624
without support from Jewish people.

07:57.599 --> 08:01.902
Look, if we're being honest,
we just can't judge a president

08:01.903 --> 08:03.887
by what they did before
they got into politics.

08:03.888 --> 08:05.772
What? That is all we can judge them on.

08:05.773 --> 08:07.774
Ronald Reagan was an actor.

08:07.775 --> 08:09.743
He literally lied to
people for a living,

08:09.744 --> 08:11.395
and we made him president.

08:11.396 --> 08:14.047
Uh, Obama was a community organizer,

08:14.048 --> 08:15.671
and if we're being
honest with ourselves,

08:15.672 --> 08:17.634
what the hell was that?

08:17.635 --> 08:19.953
I always wondered about it,

08:19.954 --> 08:22.723
but I didn't want to rock the boat.

08:22.724 --> 08:26.026
George W. Bush, it-it was
basically his first job.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.311
It's like his parents were like,

08:27.312 --> 08:29.215
"You got to get off the
couch and do something,"

08:29.216 --> 08:31.899
and then he became president
of the United States.

08:31.900 --> 08:35.202
All right, Joe, give me the best reason

08:35.203 --> 08:36.803
that you are voting for Trump.

08:36.804 --> 08:38.171
Well, first, see, he wants to...

08:38.172 --> 08:41.124
And don't say "make
American great again."

08:41.125 --> 08:44.044
Well, second, see, he wants to, um...

08:44.044 --> 08:45.696
bring all the jobs home,

08:45.697 --> 08:47.331
and he wants to build up the military

08:47.332 --> 08:48.916
and take care of our veterans.

08:48.917 --> 08:51.535
He said Senator McCain
wasn't a war hero

08:51.536 --> 08:52.869
because he was captured.

08:52.870 --> 08:55.188
That's like saying JFK
got what he deserved

08:55.189 --> 08:56.807
for showing off in a convertible.

08:56.808 --> 08:59.625
Mmm, I mean, you could say that, but...

09:01.679 --> 09:04.031
...everybody's gonna hate you for it.

09:04.032 --> 09:06.667
Okay, Maxine, since you
got all the answers,

09:06.668 --> 09:07.968
tell me who you voting for.

09:07.969 --> 09:08.969
Bernie Sanders.

09:08.970 --> 09:10.287
(laughs)

09:10.288 --> 09:13.273
He is the only honest
candidate in the race.

09:13.274 --> 09:14.775
We're starting a revolution.

09:14.776 --> 09:16.109
(laughs)

09:16.110 --> 09:17.778
Bernie Sanders?

09:17.779 --> 09:19.862
At least my guy stands a chance.

09:21.699 --> 09:24.718
So the leader of your revolution
is a 74-year-old man?

09:24.719 --> 09:25.742
"Vote for Bernie Sanders.

09:25.743 --> 09:27.237
He'll rebel till 6:30 p.m."

09:27.238 --> 09:28.238
(laughs)

09:28.239 --> 09:29.890
(laughs)

09:29.891 --> 09:31.257
(sighs)

09:33.144 --> 09:36.546
Uh, Maxine, I thought you
were voting for Hillary.

09:36.547 --> 09:38.048
Aren't you a feminist?

09:38.049 --> 09:41.034
Yeah, I am, but I'm not just
gonna blindly vote for a woman.

09:41.035 --> 09:42.319
I mean, Sarah Palin is a woman.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.654
Should we be voting for her?

09:43.655 --> 09:45.322
Maxine, I thought we were having

09:45.323 --> 09:48.075
an intelligent political conversation.

09:48.076 --> 09:49.710
(chuckles) You know what's crazy?

09:49.711 --> 09:51.662
Sometimes I forget
Hillary's even running.

09:51.663 --> 09:54.965
What? She's the most
qualified candidate.

09:54.966 --> 09:58.285
She was a senator, uh,
she's secretary of state

09:58.286 --> 09:59.720
and First Lady.

09:59.721 --> 10:02.022
I know, it's crazy to be that popular

10:02.023 --> 10:03.674
and that forgettable at the same time.

10:03.675 --> 10:08.094
She's like, uh... uh, she's
kind of like a Toyota Camry.

10:10.665 --> 10:13.633
Maxine, can't we just
let Hillary have this one?

10:13.634 --> 10:16.286
I mean, she's been through so much.

10:16.287 --> 10:20.240
No, the presidency is
not a consolation prize.

10:20.241 --> 10:22.509
And, uh... it's about issues.

10:22.510 --> 10:23.627
Maxine, just be honest.

10:23.628 --> 10:24.778
You don't like Hillary

10:24.779 --> 10:26.362
'cause you don't like
the way she talks.

10:26.363 --> 10:27.647
No, it's the issues.

10:27.648 --> 10:29.282
And the "how she talks."

10:29.283 --> 10:30.950
She's boring, Jerrod.

10:31.486 --> 10:33.620
And for some reason,
she dresses like a character

10:33.621 --> 10:35.588
from Star Trek: The Next Generation.

10:37.258 --> 10:41.561
Which most Trekkies feel
is the best Star Trek.

10:41.562 --> 10:43.643
And I don't even know why
we're talking about Hillary

10:43.644 --> 10:45.948
when your dad over here wants
to vote for the next Hitler.

10:45.949 --> 10:48.819
Uh-oh, what did Hitler do this time?

10:48.820 --> 10:51.138
Oh, my God, Nekeisha,
please don't tell me

10:51.139 --> 10:52.422
you are voting for Trump too.

10:52.423 --> 10:54.441
Hell no, I'm feeling the Bern.

10:54.442 --> 10:57.144
Nekeisha, you are literally wearing

10:57.145 --> 10:59.496
a Donald Trump T-shirt right now.

10:59.497 --> 11:03.483
Boy, I'm trying to get this money, okay?

11:03.484 --> 11:05.202
We selling these at his rally.

11:05.203 --> 11:06.820
BOBBY: See, on election day,

11:06.821 --> 11:08.484
I go in the booth and
just go with my gut,

11:08.485 --> 11:10.257
'cause everybody lying anyway.

11:10.258 --> 11:12.209
Did you know they got speech writers?

11:12.210 --> 11:14.211
Think about that, huh?

11:14.212 --> 11:15.679
That's not even their words.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.223
You get kicked out of school for that.

11:17.224 --> 11:19.483
But when a politician does it,
everybody clap for 'em.

11:19.484 --> 11:23.070
(laughs dryly) But not me,
not Bobby Carmichael.

11:23.071 --> 11:24.688
Joe, you voting for Trump?

11:24.689 --> 11:27.489
Let me show you my extensive catalog.

11:30.628 --> 11:32.279
Oh, damn it, Nekeisha.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.930
I told you to stop dragging
around that garbage bag.

11:33.931 --> 11:35.298
We look like a homeless couple.

11:35.299 --> 11:37.042
Boy, if we don't sell
the stuff in this bag,

11:37.043 --> 11:38.618
we will be a homeless couple.

11:38.619 --> 11:39.860
Okay, okay, enough about Trump.

11:39.861 --> 11:41.144
So Jerrod and I came
here 'cause we wanted

11:41.145 --> 11:42.239
to tell you something.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.890
I will take one of these,

11:43.891 --> 11:46.159
and I'll proudly display
it on the front lawn.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.811
- No.
- Oh, no, Joe.

11:47.812 --> 11:49.629
You are not putting that on my lawn.

11:49.630 --> 11:51.164
I don't want people thinking

11:51.165 --> 11:55.752
some Tea Party one-percenters
are living in this house.

11:55.753 --> 11:58.054
Ma, there's a beat-up washing
machine in the driveway.

11:58.055 --> 12:00.740
I'm sure nobody's gonna think that.

12:00.741 --> 12:02.392
Cynthia, we made a deal.

12:02.393 --> 12:05.045
The inside is yours,
and the outside is mine.

12:05.046 --> 12:07.681
You chose this couch, the curtains,

12:07.682 --> 12:10.083
all these stupid pictures of our boys

12:10.084 --> 12:13.553
dressed up in they stupid outfits,

12:13.554 --> 12:16.556
but the outside, that's where I'm king.

12:16.557 --> 12:20.660
He who mows the lawn gets to
choose what goes on that lawn.

12:20.661 --> 12:22.629
No. No, Joe, you're not
gonna bully Cynthia

12:22.630 --> 12:24.297
into being able to put
that sign outside.

12:24.298 --> 12:25.615
It's embarrassing.

12:25.616 --> 12:26.967
I don't know, Maxine.

12:26.968 --> 12:28.767
I don't want to mow that lawn.

12:30.655 --> 12:32.289
MAXINE: Okay, does anyone else hear

12:32.290 --> 12:33.673
how crazy Joe sounds?

12:33.674 --> 12:34.641
'Cause he's crazy.

12:34.642 --> 12:35.976
This is... this is crazy.

12:35.977 --> 12:37.294
He's crazy.

12:37.295 --> 12:38.318
Are you saying I'm crazy?

12:38.319 --> 12:39.613
All right, all right.

12:39.614 --> 12:43.917
Everybody, let's all just
agree to hate Ted Cruz

12:43.918 --> 12:45.852
and eat some barbecue.

12:45.853 --> 12:48.622
What y'all say about that?

12:48.623 --> 12:49.606
No, I'm going to this Trump rally,

12:49.607 --> 12:50.941
and y'all should come with me,

12:50.942 --> 12:52.765
instead of staying here,
sitting on the couch,

12:52.766 --> 12:55.028
criticizing me, judging me.

12:55.029 --> 12:57.347
The least you can do is get informed.

12:57.348 --> 12:59.566
(scoffs) I already know
what I need to know.

12:59.567 --> 13:01.418
Well, of course you do, know-it-all.

13:01.419 --> 13:03.370
"Know-it-all"?

13:03.371 --> 13:05.904
Yeah, we call you that sometimes.

13:06.624 --> 13:08.124
Usually behind your back,

13:08.125 --> 13:10.760
because it's more polite.

13:10.761 --> 13:12.245
You know what your problem is?

13:12.246 --> 13:14.397
My problem is you voting for Trump.

13:14.398 --> 13:16.639
And, you know, I'm not gonna
let you put this stupid sign

13:16.640 --> 13:17.957
out in front of your house.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.618
So...

13:23.524 --> 13:24.690
(grunts)

13:26.093 --> 13:27.760
You finished?

13:28.679 --> 13:30.997
Well, now I am.

13:30.998 --> 13:32.949
Maxine, you know what your problem is?

13:32.950 --> 13:34.634
You say you're open-minded,

13:34.635 --> 13:36.253
but if anybody doesn't agree with you,

13:36.254 --> 13:37.938
you call them stupid.

13:37.939 --> 13:40.807
And that's gonna cause a lot of
problems in your personal life.

13:40.808 --> 13:42.475
Now, if I'm being honest,

13:42.476 --> 13:44.427
it's gonna cause a
whole lot of problems

13:44.428 --> 13:46.545
in this relationship
with you and Jerrod.

13:49.767 --> 13:52.935
Well, I didn't know you felt that way.

13:55.373 --> 13:57.173
Jerrod, honey.

13:57.174 --> 13:58.675
JERROD: Don't worry, Mom.

13:58.676 --> 14:00.043
I'm sure she'll be fine.

14:00.044 --> 14:02.828
Who?

14:07.268 --> 14:09.920
I just wanted to know if you
were gonna stay for dinner,

14:09.921 --> 14:13.072
see how many steaks
to put on the grill.

14:22.399 --> 14:25.236
Who is your dad to say that our
relationship isn't gonna work?

14:25.237 --> 14:27.705
Well, Maxine, he was angry.

14:27.706 --> 14:29.206
And you were angry.

14:29.207 --> 14:30.741
The whole fight got out of hand.

14:30.742 --> 14:34.028
Well, I'm sorry, it's just
Trump makes me so mad.

14:34.029 --> 14:36.330
Well, here it comes again. Ugh.

14:36.331 --> 14:39.984
Look, all I know is that we were
supposed to go over there

14:39.985 --> 14:41.769
and tell my parents we got engaged,

14:41.770 --> 14:43.554
and then you ended up yelling at my dad.

14:43.555 --> 14:44.822
He yelled at me.

14:44.823 --> 14:46.006
Yeah, well, you were supposed

14:46.007 --> 14:47.157
to be the rational one.

14:47.158 --> 14:49.260
That's why I'm engaged to
you and not my father.

14:49.261 --> 14:52.913
Well, that and the whole incest thing,

14:52.914 --> 14:54.898
and the fact that I'm straight.

14:54.899 --> 14:57.885
It's a pretty big age gap, too.

14:57.886 --> 14:59.607
Okay, Jerrod, why didn't
you stand up for me

14:59.608 --> 15:01.191
when your dad was
saying all that stuff?

15:01.192 --> 15:03.974
All I know is that my dad
said he was voting for Trump,

15:03.975 --> 15:05.559
and then you called him crazy.

15:05.560 --> 15:08.063
Because people who vote
for Trump are crazy.

15:08.064 --> 15:10.487
Let me list a few other people
who are also voting for Trump.

15:10.488 --> 15:13.851
Charlie Sheen, Pete Rose, Mike Tyson.

15:13.852 --> 15:16.420
All very successful in their fields.

15:16.421 --> 15:19.106
So maybe you should be
down at that Trump rally,

15:19.107 --> 15:21.508
because you're so open to new ideas.

15:21.509 --> 15:23.877
Well, look, Maxine, all I'm
saying is true democracy

15:23.878 --> 15:26.497
isn't just listening to people
you already agree with.

15:26.498 --> 15:28.182
You got to hear both sides.

15:28.183 --> 15:30.184
Uh, uh, Abraham Lincoln

15:30.185 --> 15:32.786
populated his cabinet with
people who disagree with him

15:32.787 --> 15:35.656
because he knew the answer was
always someplace in the middle.

15:35.657 --> 15:38.592
So maybe if we go down
to that Trump rally,

15:38.593 --> 15:40.544
my dad will appreciate the gesture.

15:40.545 --> 15:43.230
And maybe he'll even go to,
like, a Bernie rally with you.

15:43.231 --> 15:44.932
And then we'll all be informed.

15:44.933 --> 15:47.051
That's true democracy in action.

15:47.052 --> 15:48.919
(sighs)

15:48.920 --> 15:50.237
Yeah, I'm not going.

15:50.238 --> 15:51.939
Seriously?

15:51.940 --> 15:53.390
You know what, just-just go, Jerrod.

15:53.391 --> 15:55.335
And while you're out there,
you can decide whether or not

15:55.336 --> 15:57.519
you want to marry someone
you think is so close-minded.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.480
Uh, you know, fine, I will go, Maxine.

15:59.481 --> 16:02.182
But just know you should
be ashamed of yourself,

16:02.183 --> 16:04.418
because I just gave an amazing speech.

16:04.419 --> 16:05.919
If Abraham Lincoln heard that speech,

16:05.920 --> 16:07.754
he would have freed me first.

16:14.863 --> 16:16.864
Dad.

16:16.865 --> 16:18.766
How come democracy hurts so much?

16:18.767 --> 16:22.435
Well, sometimes you get stabbed
at a Trump rally, son.

16:23.938 --> 16:25.556
(sighs) Jerrod, are you okay?

16:25.557 --> 16:27.091
Yeah.

16:27.092 --> 16:29.093
You know, these things happen, Maxine.

16:29.094 --> 16:31.412
Do my best to soldier through.

16:31.413 --> 16:33.831
I believe it was Medgar
Evers who once said....

16:33.832 --> 16:36.265
Okay, Jerrod, you were
only stabbed a little.

16:37.452 --> 16:40.003
Don't you worry, it's gonna be okay.

16:40.004 --> 16:40.988
Your mama's here, baby.

16:40.989 --> 16:42.473
Joe, this should have been you.

16:42.474 --> 16:44.041
What?

16:44.042 --> 16:45.376
You supposed to protect him.

16:45.377 --> 16:46.960
You've lived your life.

16:46.961 --> 16:49.031
Okay, see, I knew something
like this was gonna happen

16:49.032 --> 16:49.763
at a Trump rally.

16:49.764 --> 16:51.632
All of his supporters are
just out of control.

16:51.633 --> 16:53.000
Now, wait a minute, you don't know

16:53.001 --> 16:55.319
that Jerrod was stabbed
by a Trump supporter.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.271
There were other protesters there too,

16:57.272 --> 16:59.306
getting people all riled up.

16:59.307 --> 17:02.242
Now, why do you go to a
man's event and boo him?

17:02.243 --> 17:05.929
I heard that that, uh, Bruno
Mars was in town not a week ago.

17:05.930 --> 17:07.633
I don't care for him.
Don't like his music.

17:07.634 --> 17:09.383
But I didn't go boo him.

17:09.384 --> 17:12.368
No, I let that little Hawaiian
man do his little concert

17:12.369 --> 17:16.306
and dance his little
Hawaiian-man dance.

17:16.307 --> 17:18.625
This is 100% Trump's fault.

17:18.626 --> 17:20.611
He encourages violence.

17:20.612 --> 17:22.994
And the only reason Jerrod was
down there was 'cause of you.

17:22.996 --> 17:24.732
You may as well have
stabbed him yourself.

17:24.733 --> 17:27.568
Oh, there you go pointing fingers again.

17:27.569 --> 17:29.603
Okay, will the both
of you just shut up!

17:29.604 --> 17:32.222
Your fighting is the reason

17:32.223 --> 17:35.558
my baby is in this bed
clinging to his life.

17:37.429 --> 17:39.730
Look, everybody is just too angry.

17:39.731 --> 17:42.750
We're supposed to be able to
have constructive conversations

17:42.751 --> 17:45.052
about politics without it devolving

17:45.053 --> 17:47.271
into yelling or name-calling.

17:47.272 --> 17:50.290
There needs to be some
middle ground here.

17:50.291 --> 17:53.260
And if it takes me getting
stabbed to unite you two,

17:53.261 --> 17:56.296
then I guess that's just what
had to happen, all right?

17:56.297 --> 17:59.299
I got stabbed so you guys
could live in peace.

17:59.300 --> 18:02.236
So you guys could heal.

18:02.237 --> 18:04.320
I'm the Jesus of this story.

18:05.190 --> 18:07.407
- No.
- Yeah, not happening.

18:07.408 --> 18:09.660
Are you two just gonna ignore

18:09.661 --> 18:12.278
my son's dying wish?

18:13.681 --> 18:16.216
Today was supposed to go
perfectly, all right?

18:16.217 --> 18:19.052
We were supposed to go over,
eat some barbecue,

18:19.053 --> 18:22.289
and I was gonna tell you that
Maxine and I got engaged.

18:22.290 --> 18:24.041
It was a very romantic morning.

18:24.042 --> 18:25.909
Engaged?

18:25.910 --> 18:28.962
Well, you bring it in here,
you little socialist. Come on.

18:28.963 --> 18:30.414
(laughing)

18:30.415 --> 18:32.466
(groans loudly)

18:32.467 --> 18:33.901
All right.

18:33.902 --> 18:36.270
Trump's still an idiot,
but you give the best hugs.

18:36.271 --> 18:38.198
Aw, well, that political argument

18:38.199 --> 18:39.649
got a little out of hand.

18:39.650 --> 18:43.086
Maxine is our family.
Maxine is our family.

18:43.087 --> 18:45.205
Maxine is our family.

18:45.206 --> 18:49.542
I heard that if you repeat
things, it gets better.

18:49.543 --> 18:51.677
They were wrong.

18:52.780 --> 18:54.614
So, when's the big day?

18:54.615 --> 18:57.133
Well, I mean, it just happened...
we don't know yet.

18:57.134 --> 18:59.085
Let me see the ring.

18:59.086 --> 19:00.987
Well, there is no ring.

19:00.988 --> 19:03.106
Why isn't there a ring?

19:03.107 --> 19:06.109
(stammering): W-Well,
we're not that type of couple.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.461
Mm, we'll talk about this later.

19:08.462 --> 19:10.146
CYNTHIA: So...

19:10.147 --> 19:14.032
the big news is that...
nothing has changed.

19:16.337 --> 19:20.023
You two are just telling us
that you had a conversation.

19:20.024 --> 19:21.407
Yeah, but it was

19:21.408 --> 19:23.626
a pretty big conversation.

19:23.627 --> 19:25.828
I think it was a pretty big deal.

19:25.829 --> 19:27.480
Son, I think you need to sit back

19:27.481 --> 19:29.015
and examine your day so far.

19:29.016 --> 19:32.035
Now, I shook the hand
of the future president

19:32.036 --> 19:33.770
of the United States.

19:33.771 --> 19:36.055
You broke up a fight
and got yourself stabbed.

19:36.056 --> 19:38.574
Now, this little engagement news,

19:38.575 --> 19:41.009
that's, like, number three on the list.

19:42.029 --> 19:45.014
Yeah. If it had happened yesterday,

19:45.015 --> 19:47.166
it would have been huge news.

19:47.167 --> 19:50.152
(laughs): I didn't do
nothin' yesterday.

19:51.405 --> 19:53.172
Are you kidding me right now?

19:53.173 --> 19:54.841
This means nothing to you guys?

19:54.842 --> 19:56.993
I mean, Ma, you showed more emotion

19:56.994 --> 19:59.445
when Maxine said she
wasn't voting for Hillary.

19:59.446 --> 20:02.382
Yeah, well, that's gonna change
the country for eight years,

20:02.383 --> 20:04.667
but this marriage is just...

20:04.668 --> 20:07.186
statistically speaking, uh...

20:07.187 --> 20:09.105
Oh, I ain't gonna say nothin'.

20:09.106 --> 20:11.708
(Cynthia chuckling)

20:11.709 --> 20:13.792
Congratulations!

20:16.343 --> 20:18.439
Okay. Jerrod,

20:18.440 --> 20:20.224
you get the pick of the first steak,

20:20.225 --> 20:22.959
because... you got stabbed.

20:24.530 --> 20:27.565
Most recently.

20:27.566 --> 20:30.284
Can y'all believe how hot
it is outside today?

20:30.285 --> 20:31.953
Mm, global warming.

20:31.954 --> 20:33.503
Well, who knows?

20:36.742 --> 20:38.910
Yeah, who knows?

20:38.911 --> 20:42.296
Although it has been
scientifically proven.

20:42.297 --> 20:46.050
Global warming was made
by and for the Chinese

20:46.051 --> 20:48.753
to make U.S. manufacturing
noncompetitive!

20:48.754 --> 20:50.254
Oh, do you know how stupid you sound?

20:50.255 --> 20:52.872
Oh, no, I want us, I want to
help the little polar bears

20:52.873 --> 20:54.313
I never even seen before.

20:54.314 --> 20:56.259
You know, they would kill us, Maxine

20:56.260 --> 20:58.884
- if you gave them half a chance.
- Oh God, the Chinese!

20:58.885 --> 21:00.347
Do you hear him? Do you?

21:00.348 --> 21:01.579
- Do you hear her?
- Sorry...

21:01.580 --> 21:03.523
All right, I'm out. Maxine
enjoy your new family.

21:03.524 --> 21:04.757
See you all in November.

21:06.010 --> 21:12.433
