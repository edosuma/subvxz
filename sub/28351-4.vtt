WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.267
The Geordies are back.
Hello!

00:13.333 --> 00:15.433
Doing the things we love.

00:15.500 --> 00:16.933
But this time...

00:18.033 --> 00:20.167
...man's gonna mix things right
up.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.200
(knocking, both gasp)

00:26.267 --> 00:28.500
Four newbies!
Oh, my God!

00:28.567 --> 00:30.167
It's gonna be fucking mint.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.933
Anna's giving the Geordie squad
a naughty facelift.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.300
I love a bit of change, me.

00:37.367 --> 00:40.067
But some things never change.

00:43.467 --> 00:45.000
I love this family.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.800
Ding fucking ding, you dicks.

00:48.867 --> 00:49.867
(all cheering)

00:49.933 --> 00:52.167
Take it all in, bitch.
Take it all in.

00:52.233 --> 00:56.567
I'm already packing a
double-decker
but this thing is ridiculous.

00:56.633 --> 00:58.800
This is gonna be
your home away from home.

00:58.867 --> 01:00.633
I'm so glad to see Jay.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.933
He's grabbed my arse
and gave us the most amazing
kiss.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.333
Sam would never do that.

01:07.633 --> 01:10.767
Having Jay here made us realise
how much I do miss him.

01:10.833 --> 01:13.567
Why am I here?
All that matters is just me and
you.

01:13.633 --> 01:16.500
Pre-drinks at my house.
(cheering)

01:17.500 --> 01:19.167
Bye.
Thanks for the invite.

01:19.233 --> 01:22.633
I never thought that Sam Gowland
would be the one that gets me

01:22.700 --> 01:24.500
the way that Chloe used to.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.333
I fancy the lad.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.500
Are you gonna make me breakfast
every morning?

01:32.567 --> 01:35.467
Depends what you do for me
on the night-time.

01:35.533 --> 01:38.633
There was a time when me and Sam
used to own that shag pad

01:38.700 --> 01:41.567
but look at wor now.
We're like an old married
couple.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.167
I'm preened to perfection.

01:46.233 --> 01:48.300
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:48.367 --> 01:51.267
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:51.333 --> 01:54.833
Sometimes bubbly, sometimes
bitchy.
I'm all over the place.

01:54.900 --> 01:58.100
I'm that good-looking,
I'd even neck on with myself.

01:58.167 --> 02:00.500
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.300
I might dance like a granddad
but I'm proper radge.

02:03.367 --> 02:06.100
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double-Fs.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.500
I might look rough and ready
but I'm a massive softie.

02:09.567 --> 02:13.100
I can't believe anyone
would put me in charge of this
lot.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.267
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

02:27.600 --> 02:29.633
Well, last night was eventful.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.433
Me and Natalie necked on.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.967
Tahlia pulled a fittie.

02:33.033 --> 02:35.067
Bethan and Beau
ended up in the shag pad

02:35.133 --> 02:38.100
and I ended the night
the only way I know how.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.800
Fuck me.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.033
That's like a horse piss.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.467
Nathan's bed
is wetter than Niagara Falls.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.467
He's 27 years old.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.567
No human man should ever do
that.

02:50.633 --> 02:52.800
Morning.
Nathan, what's that?

02:52.867 --> 02:54.167
You look proud.

02:56.233 --> 02:59.367
Good morning.
Oh, there was an accident.

02:59.433 --> 03:01.333
(laughter)

03:01.400 --> 03:04.633
Have you banged?
A gentleman never kisses and
tells.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.367
Oh. That's a no.
Apart from now.

03:06.433 --> 03:09.667
You're no gentleman so...
No, I didn't fuck. I was too
pissed.

03:09.733 --> 03:12.833
Last night, me and Bethan
slept in the shag pad again.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.667
We only cuddled. I'm in no rush.

03:14.733 --> 03:18.333
I really like the girl so
I don't wanna mess things up
again.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.800
I will say one thing.
I did neck on last night.

03:21.867 --> 03:23.900
Who with? Aw, shit, I remember
now.

03:23.967 --> 03:27.567
Would your girlfriend not be
arsed
that you necked on with Nathan?

03:27.633 --> 03:30.933
I don't think so. I wouldn't be
bothered if she did it with him.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.733
I'm pretty sure that my
girlfriend
wouldn't mind that I kissed
Nathan,

03:34.800 --> 03:38.067
but the more Chloe brings it up
the more it's playing on my
mind.

03:38.133 --> 03:41.100
You made me cry again, Sam.
I always make you cry, don't I?

03:41.167 --> 03:43.700
You don't make me cry,
you make me confess shit.

03:43.767 --> 03:45.500
I like that Nathan and Sam get
on,

03:45.567 --> 03:47.733
but last night
they were joint at the hip.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.933
It's starting to annoy us.
I think you're my shrink.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.767
Who? What's the English version
of a shrink?

03:53.833 --> 03:56.133
PayPal.
What?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.767
He's not a money transferring
scheme.

03:58.833 --> 03:59.933
(laughter)

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Well, this bed's not gonna
clean itself, is it?

04:03.067 --> 04:04.567
Go on, then. Clean it, then.

04:04.633 --> 04:08.600
(as Borat) "Mattress is dark.
Yes.
I win, I win!

04:08.667 --> 04:12.233
The joke is on you.
The wee is on me."

04:12.300 --> 04:13.833
He is not fucking right.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.767
Having cuddles with Beau again
last night was really nice,

04:23.833 --> 04:25.767
but I've missed my girls.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.700
Oh, there she is.
Hello, honey.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.967
Here comes Bethan
on her walk of shame.

04:32.033 --> 04:34.767
You look like you've been
on a bloody electric site.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.367
Electrocuted. How was it?

04:37.867 --> 04:41.600
How long do you think you'll
hold
off for before you wanna shag
Beau?

04:41.667 --> 04:42.933
I don't know, you know?

04:43.000 --> 04:46.233
Like, I'm waiting for the time
where I feel like it's right.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.800
The more and more time
I'm spending with Beau,

04:48.867 --> 04:51.600
the harder it is to resist
sleeping with him.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.133
He slept fully naked.
Did you wanna touch it?

04:54.200 --> 04:57.067
No, I didn't. It scared us a
bit.
I was like... (gasps)

04:57.133 --> 05:00.900
Cock fright. Now I know
why people use aubergine emojis.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.300
I'm not being funny
but look at my hair.

05:03.367 --> 05:05.933
It's actually quite cute.
I feel like Hagrid.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.600
You look like Hagrid
with fake eyelashes on.

05:16.067 --> 05:19.500
Ah! I've got a fucking spelt.
(laughs)

05:19.567 --> 05:22.400
Don't hurt it, though. Sam!
(groans)

05:22.467 --> 05:24.133
Oh, my God, that's so big, man.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.933
Me and Nathan do some weird
things,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.833
but I've never walked him around
by his cock before.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.433
I don't know if this is normal
for you boys.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.533
(laughter)
Come on. Come on, doggy.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.000
(laughs)
I just don't know how I feel.

05:37.067 --> 05:40.100
Sam walking Nathan around
by his willy

05:40.167 --> 05:41.600
is a little bit much for me.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.567
I didn't know they were that
close.

05:43.633 --> 05:45.333
The girls are dead confused.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.833
Their faces went...

05:46.900 --> 05:49.133
Dead confused.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.867
I don't know if they're cooked.
Take one of these.

06:03.533 --> 06:07.033
Do you want more ketchup with
that?
A bit excessive, that.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.100
Hi, everyone.
(all cheering)

06:10.167 --> 06:12.733
What the fuck is Anna doing
here?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.500
Oh, aye, we work for her.

06:14.567 --> 06:16.767
How are the newbies settling in?
Hi, Beau.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.933
Hello, nice to meet you.
Hi, Tahlia, Bethan. Nat.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.067
All right? Hello.

06:21.133 --> 06:24.033
Yous wondering why
I've got the tour bus for yous?

06:24.100 --> 06:26.967
Yes! Yeah. That is about to
become
your home from home.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.800
Ooh. What?
Yeah.

06:28.867 --> 06:31.867
Listen, I'm branching out
and I'm covering the whole UK.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.867
Yeah, you're gonna be sleeping
on it.
(all exclaim)

06:34.933 --> 06:39.567
I want yous to start by seeing
what Belfast has to offer.

06:39.633 --> 06:43.333
(all cheering)

06:43.400 --> 06:46.333
I'm buzzing off my little man
tits
to go to Belfast.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.600
The boys are meant to be unreal,
the Irish love drinking

06:49.667 --> 06:50.967
and we've got a tour bus.

06:51.033 --> 06:52.633
What could possibly go wrong?

06:52.700 --> 06:55.033
Yay!
Happy with that, like.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.300
I'm so excited
for our first trip away.

06:57.367 --> 07:00.433
I love Northern Irish
everything,
especially the stew.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.967
I can't wait to get there
and get myself a bowl.

07:03.033 --> 07:06.467
Listen, I don't want that bus
looking anything like this
house.

07:06.533 --> 07:09.133
If it's anything like that
kitchen...
Nathan.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.267
(gasps)
Nathan!

07:10.333 --> 07:12.567
What the fuck is wrong with
yous?

07:12.633 --> 07:15.267
You need to start packing
cos you're going today,

07:15.333 --> 07:17.833
but Nathan, get that kitchen
tidy
before you go.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.167
Let's get ready!
Bye!

07:20.233 --> 07:22.900
Bye, Anna.
Love you, Anna!

07:22.967 --> 07:26.833
Close quarters.
Yous are all fucking grassies.
Aye.

07:26.900 --> 07:29.233
Fuck tidying up.
I've got packing to do.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.600
We're going to Belfast.

07:30.667 --> 07:34.067
Whoo!
Right, then, ladies and
gentlemen.

07:35.533 --> 07:37.467
You can't wear that.

07:37.533 --> 07:39.200
It's gonna be freezing cold.

07:39.267 --> 07:41.933
This is what I wear travelling.
It's comfy gear.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.067
You're wearing that?
It's gonna be freezing.

07:45.133 --> 07:48.067
Does Beau know we're going
to Belfast and not Brazil?

07:48.133 --> 07:50.367
Because he's going
with a pair of shorts.

07:50.433 --> 07:51.500
It's -2!

07:51.567 --> 07:52.833
Haggis, haggis!

07:52.900 --> 07:55.167
We're going to Ireland,
not Scotland.

07:55.233 --> 07:58.100
Guinness, Guinness,
Guinness, Guiness!

08:01.633 --> 08:05.300
Chloe, don't look. Jealous.
They're fucking minging. So are
you.

08:05.367 --> 08:07.900
I don't know what to pack.
It's stressing us out.

08:07.967 --> 08:10.500
So you know what?
I'm just gonna pack it all.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.267
I'm really excited to go to
Belfast,

08:19.333 --> 08:21.867
but at the same time,
I'm missing my boyfriend.

08:21.933 --> 08:24.733
There's only one person
that can relate to that.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.000
My girl Holly.
(through phone) "Hello?"

08:27.067 --> 08:29.500
(gasps) What's been going on,
part-timer?

08:35.200 --> 08:37.267
I'm very, very, very jealous.

08:37.332 --> 08:39.267
Honestly, I'm missing Jay.

08:39.332 --> 08:41.400
I'm finding it really hard
this time.

08:41.467 --> 08:43.366
Since I seen Jay at the house
party,

08:43.433 --> 08:46.033
it has made me think
about my place in the house.

08:46.100 --> 08:49.000
I have really, really missed him
but at the same time,

08:49.067 --> 08:50.700
I wanna be there for everyone.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.200
I'm just gonna enjoy my time
and take your advice onboard,
Hols.

09:05.267 --> 09:08.567
Holly's right.
It is work and Nathan needs us.

09:08.633 --> 09:11.100
I just need to suck it up,
get on that bus

09:11.167 --> 09:14.300
and have an amazing time in
Belfast.

09:14.367 --> 09:18.900
"I will see you very soon."
Love ya. Bye!

09:24.000 --> 09:25.500
(horn honking)

09:25.567 --> 09:27.533
Oh, my God, is that the bus?
Yeah.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.767
We need to hurry up.
Shit, it is, Chloe!

09:32.300 --> 09:35.967
Wheeeeey!

09:36.033 --> 09:38.433
Aw, he's a darling, isn't he?

09:38.500 --> 09:40.433
(shrieks)

09:40.500 --> 09:43.033
Ah-hah! Get off, get off.

09:45.267 --> 09:47.300
Go off, man. I'm that side.

09:47.367 --> 09:48.567
You're not.
I am!

09:48.633 --> 09:50.867
It looks like me and Sam
are gonna be acting

09:50.933 --> 09:53.400
like an old married couple
once again tonight.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.500
This time we're sleeping
in separate beds. Brilliant.

09:56.567 --> 09:59.167
Oh! It's tiny.

09:59.967 --> 10:04.967
Belfast, I hope you are ready
for us Geordies to take over.

10:05.033 --> 10:07.333
Belfast, here we come!

10:07.400 --> 10:10.133
You are more over each other
than me and Sam used to be.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.400
You've gotta pull a moonie
out the window. Honk, honk!

10:13.467 --> 10:15.533
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

10:17.967 --> 10:18.167
.

10:20.700 --> 10:20.900
.

10:32.433 --> 10:35.533
This is the type of place
where everyone knows everyone.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.767
Aw, yeah.

10:36.833 --> 10:39.700
I am buzzing to be on this bus
with this lot.

10:39.767 --> 10:42.400
I just wanna get this UK tour
off to a wicked start.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.800
Let's play some drinking games,
shall we?

10:44.867 --> 10:46.500
(all) Yeah!

10:47.333 --> 10:48.833
Dodge the cock.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.900
Yeah, it's called cock dodging.
Go!

10:50.967 --> 10:53.100
(all cheering)

10:53.167 --> 10:56.400
How many was that? That's 50
points!
So competitive!

10:56.467 --> 10:57.667
Go!

10:57.733 --> 10:59.533
(laughter)
Nearly.

11:00.533 --> 11:01.867
Go on.
(laughter)

11:01.933 --> 11:02.933
50 points!

11:03.000 --> 11:07.100
I'm a right pro at this game cos
I've been dodging cocks for
years.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.900
You look like
a synchronised swimmer!
(laughter)

11:09.967 --> 11:12.700
It's all getting pure crazy
on this bus.

11:12.767 --> 11:16.633
I need some bestie time with
Bethan
and I need the goss about Beau.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.600
Let's go for some more drink.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.600
What happened last night?
Nothing.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.067
Not even a touch?

11:29.133 --> 11:31.900
You've been sharing a bed
quite a lot now

11:31.967 --> 11:33.933
and you haven't even had
a finger yet?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.067
I'm waiting until I'm
comfortable.

11:36.133 --> 11:39.133
I'm not gonna let anyone
put pressure on us the way...

11:39.200 --> 11:41.933
Like, I'm gonna wait until I'm
ready.
Yeah.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.533
I do honestly, genuinely think
he does like ya.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.767
He's all over ya.

11:45.833 --> 11:49.333
You and him are more all over
each
other than me and Sam used to be

11:49.400 --> 11:51.033
when we first got together.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.867
I am happy for Bethan,
but seeing her and Beau so close

11:53.933 --> 11:56.233
does make us question
my own relationship.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.900
Me and Sam live together but
why do I feel so far apart from
him?

12:03.067 --> 12:05.333
Are yous enjoying the games?
I'm drunk, me.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.533
Let's take it to the next level.

12:07.600 --> 12:11.300
I know. I know.
What? What? What are you doing?

12:11.367 --> 12:13.533
Everyone knows that
when you're on a bus,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.500
it's basically in the highway
code

12:15.567 --> 12:18.233
that you've gotta pull a moonie
out the window.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.500
(cheering)
Beep your horn! Honk, honk,
honk!

12:21.567 --> 12:22.567
(laughter)

12:22.633 --> 12:24.533
Nathan, show them your anus.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.833
I have quite a nice arse

12:25.900 --> 12:28.533
and it's a shame that
the world isn't seeing it.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.633
(cheering)

12:32.567 --> 12:35.100
(laughter)

12:35.167 --> 12:38.233
Oh! Split my jeans, man.
One at a time. Let's have a
look.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.600
Concentrate on getting
in your girl's hole

12:40.667 --> 12:42.000
than getting in my hole.

12:42.067 --> 12:43.833
Let's just have a look.
Exactly!

12:43.900 --> 12:45.900
We'll be delicate. There.
(screams)

12:45.967 --> 12:47.233
(laughter)

12:48.333 --> 12:50.067
He's gonna wear that.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.800
Nathan's trousers look stupid

12:51.867 --> 12:54.833
so we might as well make them
look
more stupid-er.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.633
Come on, let's do the other
side.
(cheering)

12:57.700 --> 13:00.933
Don't.
(cheering)

13:01.000 --> 13:04.133
(all chanting) Rip them jeans!
Rip them jeans!

13:05.833 --> 13:08.633
Right, that's enough. Nathan.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.000
Nathan, that looks like a
fucking
maxi dress. Let us borrow it.

13:12.067 --> 13:15.200
Let's go from a maxi dress
to a mini skirt. New hole.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.567
There it is! I see it!

13:22.633 --> 13:24.167
Where?
There!

13:25.900 --> 13:28.767
Oh, my God, is the bus gonna
fit?
It might not.

13:28.833 --> 13:32.367
Get your passports ready,
we're going to Belfast.

13:32.433 --> 13:34.233
(ship horn blows)

13:37.900 --> 13:39.667
I think we actually made it!

13:43.033 --> 13:44.700
(cheering)

13:44.767 --> 13:46.300
So excited to go out tonight.

13:48.933 --> 13:51.133
That was a long journey

13:51.200 --> 13:55.067
but finally,
we've arrived in Belfast.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.500
Yous.
What?

13:59.567 --> 14:00.767
Just look outside.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.833
Ohhhh.
That's a fucking campsite.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.333
(all groaning)

14:05.400 --> 14:08.500
Bitches get stitches
and we've been stitched up.

14:11.667 --> 14:15.800
Ugh. Yous, there's actually
nothing here.

14:15.867 --> 14:17.167
Is this a joke?

14:17.233 --> 14:19.300
When Anna said
we were going to Belfast,

14:19.367 --> 14:21.300
I thought she meant the city
centre,

14:21.367 --> 14:24.033
not the countryside
next to some fucking carpark.

14:24.100 --> 14:25.167
Shower! Shower!

14:25.233 --> 14:27.700
I'm expecting to stay
in a beautiful hotel,

14:27.767 --> 14:31.000
but instead I'm going
into communal showers.

14:31.967 --> 14:34.133
Oh! There's definitely a shower,
like.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.400
It's actually not that bad.
There's at least two mirrors.

14:37.467 --> 14:41.133
We've got working showers,
working
toilets and it's warm in here.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.067
If all fails tonight,
I'm sleeping in a urinal.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.167
You could shower
and I could sit here.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.633
Shower and talk.

14:49.700 --> 14:53.667
Sorry, Nathan, but in what world
would I want a front row seat

14:53.733 --> 14:55.433
to Beau's ball washing?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.933
Come on, Sam!

14:58.000 --> 15:01.467
No lie, I feel like these
are better showers than the
house.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.533
They are!
This is luxury.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.800
I was gonna bring our suitcase
over here.

15:05.867 --> 15:07.133
Yeah.
Let's get ready!

15:07.200 --> 15:09.900
I'm so excited
to go out a night in Belfast

15:09.967 --> 15:12.500
cos I've heard
that's where all the fitties
are.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.767
(Sam screaming)
(laughter)

15:16.833 --> 15:18.633
Thanks, Beau.
No worries.

15:19.733 --> 15:21.267
Whoa!

15:23.267 --> 15:25.400
(groaning, plopping)

15:25.467 --> 15:26.533
Ohhhh!

15:32.300 --> 15:34.933
I am not gonna let
getting ready in this toilet

15:35.033 --> 15:36.333
put a damper on tonight.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.567
I'm raring for Belfast.

15:41.567 --> 15:44.800
Bethan, you and Beau being
close...
(gasps) I know, like.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.600
You've got loads of feelings.

15:46.667 --> 15:47.667
(gasps) Shit! No.

15:47.733 --> 15:50.467
Yeah, you have. Stop lying!
I haven't got feelings.

15:50.533 --> 15:54.167
You only have feelings when...
You have the cock inside ya.
Yes.

15:54.233 --> 15:57.067
I can't deny, there is chemistry
between me and Beau

15:57.133 --> 16:00.100
and I reckon there's more
than a cuddle on the cards soon.

16:00.167 --> 16:04.000
Obviously, don't do anything yet
cos you just don't know.

16:04.067 --> 16:06.300
Keep the guard up.
Keep the guard up, yeah.

16:06.367 --> 16:08.833
When you let that down,
you're fucked. I know.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.367
Nathan Henry?
Aye, aye.

16:18.433 --> 16:20.633
You're in a different city,
mate.
And?

16:20.700 --> 16:23.033
You're a free single man,
do what you want.

16:23.100 --> 16:26.500
If I get with anyone tonight,
I'll never see them again.
Exactly.

16:26.567 --> 16:29.767
I will try and go on the pull
for yous lots to get you off my
back

16:29.833 --> 16:31.800
but I'm not making any promises.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.733
Beau, what's your plan?
Can you shag on the bus?

16:34.800 --> 16:36.533
Everyone loves a trier.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.867
If Beau can't shag Bethan
in the shag pad,

16:38.933 --> 16:41.700
what hope does he have
shagging her on a fucking bus?

16:41.767 --> 16:44.833
I'm gonna play it by ear.
Yous are in a really good place.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.333
It's comfortable.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.033
We're cuddling, kissing,
we're touchy-feely.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.433
The banter's flowing. It's easy.
I'm just gonna keep it easy.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.833
She's got good craic.
She is sound as fuck.

16:54.900 --> 16:58.000
It's really cute watching Beau
and Bethan getting closer,

16:58.067 --> 17:01.267
but it is making me miss having
my girlfriend to snuggle with.

17:01.333 --> 17:04.900
I want us to show that fucking
club
that we can fucking drink.

17:04.967 --> 17:07.300
Hands in!
(all cheer)

17:14.433 --> 17:17.067
Oh, Jesus Christ, my nipples.

17:17.133 --> 17:20.599
Ah! It's ruining my hair!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

17:20.666 --> 17:23.000
Come on, Chloe, quick.
Run, your hair!

17:24.867 --> 17:27.067
We're all planning
to get mortal tonight.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.733
I've got a very good feeling
about Belfast.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.800
Bethan, you do the cheers.

17:31.867 --> 17:34.433
Right. We're gonna have a cheers
to Anna.

17:34.500 --> 17:38.933
Anna. For being a wicked sport
and getting this wicked bus.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.667
You can tell she's new.
Yeah.

17:40.733 --> 17:43.000
Let's just have
a fucking wicked night!

17:43.067 --> 17:45.733
(cheering)

17:45.800 --> 17:48.000
Ireland!
Oh!

17:48.067 --> 17:50.700
Everyone looks absolutely unreal
tonight.

17:50.767 --> 17:54.800
Woo-hoo! We are so raring
to hit Belfast city.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.600
(Chloe screaming)

18:05.700 --> 18:08.000
When I say Bel...
..you say fast!

18:08.067 --> 18:10.067
Bel. Fast!
Bel. Fast!

18:10.133 --> 18:13.600
It's the first night. We need
to leave a lasting impression.

18:13.667 --> 18:16.133
I don't even wanna
fucking be with ya!

18:16.200 --> 18:18.500
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

18:21.433 --> 18:21.633
.

18:24.200 --> 18:24.400
.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.900
We get into the club
and it is absolutely bouncing

18:49.967 --> 18:52.900
and the drinks
are obviously on flow.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.767
It's the first night in Belfast

18:59.833 --> 19:02.467
and we need to leave
a lasting impression.

19:04.667 --> 19:07.133
(dance music playing)

19:32.500 --> 19:36.000
Bethan's a sound lass but I
don't
wanna get too serious too
quickly

19:36.067 --> 19:39.133
and risk ruining things
like I have in the past.

19:45.733 --> 19:47.567
At the start, Beau was a
dickhead,

19:47.633 --> 19:50.300
but right now
he's actually being really nice

19:50.367 --> 19:53.733
about my best friend Bethan
and I really actually like him.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.400
I am on one tonight.

20:02.467 --> 20:06.300
It's so good to be out and away
with
this lot for the very first
time.

20:10.867 --> 20:11.867
Whoo!

20:14.700 --> 20:17.800
I know I deserve to be loved
by the right man,

20:17.867 --> 20:22.067
but right now that day seems
a very, very, very long way
away.

20:36.633 --> 20:38.967
I'm in Belfast
having the best night ever

20:39.033 --> 20:42.167
and Sophie's making us feel
like I'm finally fitting in.

20:48.933 --> 20:51.000
When Tahlia
first came into the house,

20:51.067 --> 20:53.567
I wasn't sure
whether she'd find her feet.

20:53.633 --> 20:57.100
But the more I'm getting to know
her, the more I'm starting to
think

20:57.167 --> 20:59.567
she is the perfect fit
for this family.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.367
I wish that Sam was all over me
the way Beau is all over Bethan.

21:18.433 --> 21:20.067
He's like a rash.

21:31.033 --> 21:32.933
I really fancy Beau tonight

21:33.000 --> 21:35.900
and I'm pretty sure we both know
where I'll be sleeping.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.633
I came in this house
excited to live the single life

21:46.700 --> 21:49.433
but I never expected
to meet someone like Bethan.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.000
Tonight is actually amazing.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.767
Things are great with Chloe.

21:58.833 --> 22:02.367
It is so good having a
girlfriend
and a best friend in one.

22:10.567 --> 22:11.767
What is going on?

22:11.833 --> 22:15.067
Sam and Nathan are making me
feel like a third wheel

22:15.133 --> 22:16.433
in my own relationship.

22:33.467 --> 22:35.867
Let's be honest,
Chloe and Sam are both thick,

22:35.933 --> 22:38.667
but Sam just happens to be
the smarter out of the two

22:38.733 --> 22:41.133
so obviously I'm gonna go to him
for advice.

22:46.567 --> 22:49.800
Me and Nathan have been friends
for years and it really hurts

22:49.867 --> 22:52.700
that he's just said Sam's advice
is better than mine.

22:57.867 --> 22:59.600
Come on, Chloe, man. Calm it.

22:59.667 --> 23:01.933
No need to cause drama
over nothing.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.500
Sophie is being a right laugh
tonight,

23:19.567 --> 23:22.067
but I know she's missing
her boyfriend.

23:38.233 --> 23:41.433
Looking around, this is a new
family
and I do miss Holly.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.433
I miss Abbie and I feel so far
away
from my boyfriend.

23:44.500 --> 23:47.000
I just feel a little bit lost.

24:01.033 --> 24:03.333
I do feel better
after letting that all out.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.333
I just need to keep my chin up
and make the most out of
Belfast.

24:22.667 --> 24:27.300
Sam is so far up Nathan's arse,
he's
forgotten he's got a girlfriend.

24:31.067 --> 24:33.400
To be honest,
this is starting to wind us up.

24:33.467 --> 24:36.100
I wanna get out of here.
I'm just so angry at Sam.

24:36.167 --> 24:39.300
He doesn't make us feel secure
in my own relationship.

24:47.433 --> 24:49.033
(all groaning)

24:49.100 --> 24:50.733
Oh, my God, it's snowing!

24:52.867 --> 24:55.733
Ugh, I feel like my nips
have got frostbite.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.167
It's time for bed.

24:58.900 --> 25:01.767
Right. Get in. Ready?
Ugh.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.400
I know Chloe's got a bee
in her bonnet about something

25:08.467 --> 25:10.567
and I probably should be
worried,

25:10.633 --> 25:13.967
but right now I'm that pissed,
she's just making me laugh.

25:14.033 --> 25:16.867
(groaning)
(laughs)

25:18.133 --> 25:21.567
Sam hasn't even realised that
I'm upset. He's just laughing.

25:21.633 --> 25:23.633
He should be making sure
that I'm OK.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.400
He just doesn't get us.

25:29.167 --> 25:32.033
I swear to God. Bye.

25:32.100 --> 25:34.033
What? (laughs)

25:36.267 --> 25:38.933
This turtleneck cost me a
fortune!

25:39.000 --> 25:40.767
What the hell has got into
Chloe?

25:40.833 --> 25:43.000
You think you're gonna
fucking marry me?

25:43.067 --> 25:45.367
I don't even wanna
fucking be with ya! Why?

25:45.433 --> 25:47.867
Fucking disgusting, man!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:47.933 --> 25:51.033
I can hear Chloe and Sam kicking
off
and I would help

25:51.100 --> 25:54.367
but I'm too mortal to even
attempt
to get off this top bunk.

25:54.433 --> 25:56.667
The last person
that I'd fucking get with.

25:56.733 --> 25:58.900
Oh, shit. I can hear Chloe
screaming.

25:58.967 --> 26:00.833
I need to make sure that she's
OK.

26:00.900 --> 26:05.500
Who'd you think you are?!
Fucking laughing. Chill.

26:05.567 --> 26:07.933
Get the fuck off
the fucking bus, then!

26:08.000 --> 26:09.200
Calm down.

26:09.267 --> 26:12.700
Chloe is going radge at Sam.
I think she just needs to go to
bed.

26:12.767 --> 26:15.467
Get off the bus. Get off the
bus.

26:16.967 --> 26:19.967
Sam is so smug, I'm not sleeping
in the same bed as him.

26:20.033 --> 26:21.467
He can go and fuck himself.

26:25.500 --> 26:29.033
Now that I've got Chloe to bed,
it's time to snuggle up with
Beau

26:29.100 --> 26:32.533
and I think tonight's the night
that I let myself get close to
him.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.900
Good night.
Night. Love you all.

26:38.933 --> 26:42.400
I'm trying to get some sleep
on the bus but it's really hard,

26:42.467 --> 26:45.600
cos I'm sure I can hear
Bethan and Beau...

26:45.667 --> 26:47.367
...getting their wicked way.

26:51.733 --> 26:54.233
I can confirm, I am close to
him.

26:54.300 --> 26:56.233
Way too close to him.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.333
Morning, bitches!

27:10.400 --> 27:12.100
Are you all awake?

27:12.167 --> 27:15.067
There's one. Morning, baby.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.867
There's the other.
The girls are obviously dead.

27:17.933 --> 27:20.167
Well, on that note, then,
boys, come on.

27:20.233 --> 27:23.933
Nothing will cure this hangover
like fresh Irish air.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.633
So it's get off the bus
and have a little natter.

27:26.700 --> 27:30.067
Ugh.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

27:30.133 --> 27:31.600
Oh. This isn't bad.
Ow.

27:36.900 --> 27:40.200
I know I do need to speak to Sam
but I just can't face it yet.

27:40.267 --> 27:42.533
We have been together
quite a long time now

27:42.600 --> 27:46.133
and the best thing for me to do
is
take a step back to clear my
head.

27:51.133 --> 27:53.567
Oh, amazing. Watch them toes.

27:53.633 --> 27:56.567
The view is nice
but when my tits are this cold,

27:56.633 --> 27:58.367
I can't fucking appreciate it.

27:58.433 --> 28:00.633
You and Chloe had a kick-off.
It wasn't me.

28:00.700 --> 28:03.067
Chloe kicked off at you.
Chloe kicked off.

28:03.133 --> 28:06.167
I thought that my and Chloe's
relationship was on the up,

28:06.233 --> 28:08.633
but after last night
I'm a little bit worried

28:08.700 --> 28:10.500
because I've done nothing wrong.

28:10.567 --> 28:12.467
I hate to say it
but I think it could be

28:12.533 --> 28:14.933
that me and you
spend a lot more time together.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.933
Me and her aren't as close...

28:17.000 --> 28:19.067
She can't take that out on me,
though.

28:19.133 --> 28:22.567
I'm not surprise that Sam is
angry
because it is embarrassing

28:22.633 --> 28:24.767
when we've got new members
of the family

28:24.833 --> 28:27.033
and your girlfriend
is going on like that.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.200
Psycho Chloe is back.

28:32.867 --> 28:36.267
I just feel like it's gonna be
so awkward and I can't be arsed.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.600
With who?
With Sam.

28:37.667 --> 28:40.700
Him and Nathan spend so much
time
together, which...

28:40.767 --> 28:43.433
It's weird. I know it's awful to
say
but they flirt.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.800
I know I'm being stupid
about Sam and Nathan,

28:45.867 --> 28:48.467
but I feel like Sam is putting
his time into Nathan

28:48.533 --> 28:50.600
and not focusing
on our relationship.

28:50.667 --> 28:53.833
I think at one point they were
looking in each other's eyes.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.233
You want a manly man.

28:55.300 --> 28:58.167
This is the thing. I want a man.

28:58.233 --> 29:00.933
Is that what you were arguing
with him about? Yeah.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.333
I want to take Chloe seriously,
but how can she think that

29:04.400 --> 29:07.267
there's anything going on
between Nathan and Sam?

29:07.333 --> 29:10.433
I think there's more to this
than she's making out.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.800
Anyway, enough about me.
What happened with you and Beau?

29:14.867 --> 29:16.400
(exhales)
What do you mean?

29:16.467 --> 29:18.000
Oh, God.
Did the willy go in?

29:18.067 --> 29:19.067
(all gasping)

29:19.133 --> 29:22.300
I have been trying to be strong
and keep my guard up with Beau,

29:22.367 --> 29:24.833
but last night,
I couldn't resist his charm.

29:24.900 --> 29:27.767
How the fuck can you shag in
that?
It was a good one.

29:30.333 --> 29:33.367
What did you do last night,
Beau?
Did you shag?

29:34.667 --> 29:36.800
Did ya?
Aye.

29:36.867 --> 29:39.367
When? Last night,
when we got back in the bus.

29:39.433 --> 29:40.967
On the bus?
Aye.

29:41.033 --> 29:42.733
(laughter)

29:42.800 --> 29:46.700
Beau has finally got a bang
and of all the places.

29:46.767 --> 29:47.967
Well in, mate.

29:48.033 --> 29:50.433
Now that you got what you
wanted,
are you done?

29:50.500 --> 29:53.667
No, I want more now.
Yay! I like that.

29:53.733 --> 29:56.000
I know the boys only think
I wanna get laid,

29:56.067 --> 29:59.900
but I like Bethan so hopefully
I'll
be bunking up again with her
soon.

29:59.967 --> 30:03.667
Now that the sex has happened,
it can go downhill very quick

30:03.733 --> 30:06.933
cos if you do any inch wrong,
she's gonna have you for it.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.633
Is that how it works?
Yeah.

30:13.633 --> 30:15.700
(phone ringing)

30:22.467 --> 30:25.833
What idiot put the phone
in the mug cupboard? Come on!

30:25.900 --> 30:28.467
Hello?
(through phone) "Hello, Chloe."

30:28.533 --> 30:30.833
Oh, hiya.
"Yous are off to work today.

30:30.900 --> 30:33.767
I want yous to check out Belfast
to get to know the city."

30:33.833 --> 30:35.833
Right. Is everyone going to
work?

30:35.900 --> 30:38.767
"You, Bethan and Beau
are gonna go oyster smashing."

30:38.833 --> 30:40.833
What the fuck's an oyster
smashing?

30:40.900 --> 30:43.400
"If you like slippery things
down your throat,

30:43.467 --> 30:45.200
you'll have a great time."

30:45.267 --> 30:47.767
I am buzzing I'm off to work
with Beau and Bethan

30:47.833 --> 30:49.600
cos I need some time away from
Sam.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.233
"Tell the rest they're off on a
tour
of the city."

30:52.300 --> 30:53.967
Right. OK, thank you.

30:54.033 --> 30:56.267
"All right, see you later,
Chloe."
Bye!

30:56.333 --> 30:58.400
Girls!

30:58.467 --> 31:02.000
I need to tell everyone what
we're
doing today, but it's so
awkward.

31:02.067 --> 31:04.800
I just hope to God
no-one brings up last night.

31:05.767 --> 31:08.233
Me, Beau and Bethan
are going to work today.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.967
We're going oyster smashing.
Oh, happy days.

31:11.033 --> 31:13.733
Beau, have you not already been
smashing oysters?

31:13.800 --> 31:15.333
Wheeeey!
(laughter)

31:15.400 --> 31:16.567
Now, now, Natalie.

31:16.633 --> 31:20.333
Don't be jealous just cos your
oyster
hasn't been smashed in a while.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.967
The rest are going sightseeing.
Sightseeing's not bad.

31:24.033 --> 31:26.400
We just get to chill
and look at the sights.

31:26.467 --> 31:28.767
Does anyone have anything to say
to anyone?

31:28.833 --> 31:30.700
Ridiculous. Chloe's ignoring us.

31:30.767 --> 31:33.133
She's gonna have to talk to us
at some point.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.000
We're on a bus together.
Should we get ready, then?

31:36.067 --> 31:37.067
All right.
Ready.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.367
You were disgusting last night.
I think we should go on a break.

31:42.433 --> 31:43.967
A break?

31:44.933 --> 31:47.367
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:49.967 --> 31:50.167
.

31:52.667 --> 31:52.867
.

32:03.533 --> 32:06.033
We're off to work,
but a bus ride around the city

32:06.100 --> 32:07.500
sounds like a treat to me.

32:07.567 --> 32:09.000
This is gonna be wicked.

32:09.067 --> 32:12.267
I hate when we go places
and we don't get to see the
city.

32:12.333 --> 32:15.033
Yeah. I'm looking forward
to seeing Belfast.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.000
I'm still fuming that
Chloe's not spoken to me today,

32:18.067 --> 32:21.433
but I'm glad that at work she'll
have a bit of time to reflect.

32:24.167 --> 32:25.800
There it is!
(laughter)

32:25.867 --> 32:28.167
Oh, come on, man.

32:28.233 --> 32:29.867
How can I get on that?

32:29.933 --> 32:31.633
I do love a tour bus,

32:31.700 --> 32:34.800
but I don't like a tour bus
without a bastard roof.

32:34.867 --> 32:37.800
I thought Belfast was
the same temperature as England.

32:37.867 --> 32:39.433
It is.
No, it's colder.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.000
Oh, my God!
If somebody needs a blanket.

32:42.067 --> 32:45.833
Now we can enjoy seeing the
sights
and be warm at the same time.

32:52.033 --> 32:53.167
Ow!
Whoa!

32:53.233 --> 32:55.433
Fucking bastard!
Fucking hell, Nathan.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.133
Something just hit me.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.867
Commissioned by Queen Victoria
in 1865

32:59.933 --> 33:02.600
in honour of her late husband...

33:02.667 --> 33:05.000
Can anyone understand
what he's saying?

33:05.067 --> 33:07.800
Just... just keep going, "Yep."

33:07.867 --> 33:10.167
I'm trying to take in
the sights of Belfast,

33:10.233 --> 33:13.800
but I cannot understand a word
that this geezer is saying.

33:13.867 --> 33:16.867
The Titanic!
The Titanic!

33:16.933 --> 33:18.467
The Titanic!
Whoo!

33:18.533 --> 33:19.533
There it is.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.233
This is ridiculous.
That boat definitely sunk.

33:22.300 --> 33:23.400
I've seen the film.

33:24.467 --> 33:28.167
Oh, my God, this morning,
Chloe was fuming, Sam.

33:28.233 --> 33:31.700
What about? She thinks that you
two
have got something going on.

33:31.767 --> 33:36.267
What?! Sophie, I have never,
in my 23 years of being born,

33:36.333 --> 33:39.367
heard something so ridiculous
in my life.

33:39.433 --> 33:43.267
She was saying that yous look
into
each other's eyes. (laughs)

33:43.333 --> 33:47.833
Listen, boo. If he was into him,
I would've been into that ages
ago.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.067
She was just saying
she wants a geezer.

33:50.133 --> 33:51.533
She wants a man-man.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.233
What's the different
between a man-man and a lad?

33:54.300 --> 33:57.667
Basically, a man-man,
if the gay friend tried to kiss
him,

33:57.733 --> 33:59.967
a man-man would be like, "No".

34:00.033 --> 34:03.367
Any man comfortable with his
sexuality can do what the fuck.

34:03.433 --> 34:07.067
I don't think Chloe has the
right
to define what a man's man is.

34:07.133 --> 34:10.567
I'll be however I want with my
mate.
Do you know what I'm saying?

34:10.632 --> 34:13.400
I'm not gonna change the way I
am.

34:13.467 --> 34:16.467
Don't get me wrong,
it's cute that Chloe's
territorial

34:16.533 --> 34:18.833
but sometimes
she oversteps the mark.

34:18.900 --> 34:22.600
I wanna say to her, "If you want
someone else, there you go, go
now."

34:22.667 --> 34:25.967
Shit. I didn't mean them
to take it that way.

34:26.033 --> 34:28.167
Sometimes I like to throw
a wee song in.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.100
Are yous up for a song?
(all) Yeah!

34:30.167 --> 34:31.867
A sing-along? Bang-on.

34:31.933 --> 34:33.500
# I'll tell me ma when I get
home

34:33.567 --> 34:35.533
# The boys won't leave
The girls alone

34:35.600 --> 34:38.000
# They pulled me hair... #
How do you know this?

34:38.067 --> 34:41.433
How on Earth does everyone
know the words to this Irish
song?

34:41.500 --> 34:44.167
We're from Newcastle.
# Out she comes as white as snow

34:44.233 --> 34:46.500
# Rings on her fingers
And bells on her toes... #

34:46.567 --> 34:48.199
I'm freezing my nipples off

34:48.266 --> 34:51.632
and the only way I can warm them
up
is by dancing with this man.

34:51.699 --> 34:53.600
# She is handsome, she is pretty

34:53.667 --> 34:55.467
# She is the belle of Belfast
city

34:55.533 --> 34:57.467
# She is courting, one, two,
three

34:57.533 --> 35:00.000
# Can you tell me who is she? #
Everyone!

35:01.567 --> 35:03.933
What even is oyster smashing?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.967
I feel like it's an oyster.
You get a hammer and smash it.

35:07.033 --> 35:10.533
Is an oyster not...? It's an
animal.
It's like a fruit.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.867
I don't understand
what oyster smashing is

35:12.933 --> 35:15.067
but I hope to God
we don't have to eat them.

35:15.133 --> 35:17.633
I'm like a dog.
I just like to be out in the
open.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.667
Like a dog.
You hump like a dog as well.

35:19.733 --> 35:21.167
I fuck like a dog as well.

35:21.233 --> 35:24.567
Since coming back in this house,
me and Sam haven't been right.

35:24.633 --> 35:26.533
He spends all of his time
with Nathan

35:26.600 --> 35:28.233
and me and him don't have sex.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.000
I just need some time
to think what I'm gonna do.

35:32.733 --> 35:35.667
Welcome to Belfast Cookery
School.
Hello! Hello.

35:35.733 --> 35:38.067
Fucking hell.
This place is a bit swanky.

35:38.133 --> 35:39.700
Let us get our posh on.

35:39.767 --> 35:41.733
How do I look? (laughs)

35:41.800 --> 35:44.233
So, we're going to
open the oysters, OK?

35:44.300 --> 35:46.633
The name for that
is actually shucking.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.867
I'm dead excited
to see how you do that.

35:48.933 --> 35:51.233
Just come at the lips.
The lips.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.300
God, it is like a vagina, isn't
it?

35:53.367 --> 35:55.067
Work it till it opens.

35:55.133 --> 35:57.067
Yeah, get some tips, get some
tips.

35:57.133 --> 35:58.433
I don't need tips.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.733
Do you wanna taste it, guys?
(all) No.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.333
Absolutely not.
I'll try it.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.867
You don't chew it?
It's like doing a shot. Yeah.

36:04.933 --> 36:06.367
I'm alreet with that.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.400
(laughter)
Don't spit it, swallow.

36:10.467 --> 36:13.900
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
(laughter)

36:13.967 --> 36:17.300
Step aside, lasses.
Let me show you how a pro does
it.

36:18.367 --> 36:20.500
(gags)
(laughter)

36:22.533 --> 36:23.867
What did it taste like?!

36:23.933 --> 36:27.033
Oh. Oh.
You all right?

36:27.100 --> 36:28.500
(belches)

36:28.567 --> 36:31.667
OK, I'm gonna let you
do it yourself.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.233
Are you not gutted
that Sam's not here?

36:37.300 --> 36:39.833
I am. This would be
the perfect double date.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.067
Sam would enjoy this.

36:41.133 --> 36:43.933
I shouldn't have been a bastard.
I'm regretting it.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.400
I know it's just banter
between him and Nathan

36:46.467 --> 36:48.933
but it's like,
"Yous are all over each other."

36:49.000 --> 36:50.800
I know that Chloe really loves
Sam

36:50.867 --> 36:53.800
so it's best that
she patches things up with him
soon.

36:53.867 --> 36:57.800
I feel like Anna's gonna like
this.
We're gonna report back,
brilliant.

36:57.867 --> 37:00.800
I really, really enjoyed today
with Bethan and Beau.

37:00.867 --> 37:04.133
But now I need to face the
music.
I need to tell him how I feel.

37:09.267 --> 37:12.767
I think it's fair to say
we've had a long tour of
Belfast.

37:12.833 --> 37:15.367
I feel like I've been on this
bus
for ten hours.

37:15.433 --> 37:17.867
(alarm blares)

37:17.933 --> 37:19.033
Where are the boys?!

37:19.100 --> 37:20.300
(alarm blares)

37:20.367 --> 37:21.967
I've seen no boys so far!

37:22.033 --> 37:24.600
(alarm blares)
Come on!

37:24.667 --> 37:28.467
Whoo! Whoooo!

37:28.533 --> 37:31.033
Geordies will be Geordies
and it's fair to say,

37:31.100 --> 37:33.367
I doubt we'll be allowed
on this bus again.

37:33.433 --> 37:36.100
Thank you very much!
Time that we went for a drink.

37:36.167 --> 37:38.167
Yes!
(all) Thank you!

37:38.233 --> 37:39.267
Thank you!

37:43.133 --> 37:45.833
(gasps)
Hey, guys.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.233
Hello.
Oh, hello!

37:48.300 --> 37:49.933
Oh, isn't this lovely in here?

37:50.000 --> 37:53.767
We've arrived at the pub and
Chloe,
Beau and Bethan are already
there.

37:53.833 --> 37:57.167
I wanna sit the furthest away
from Chloe as I possibly can

37:57.233 --> 37:58.833
until she says sorry.

38:00.067 --> 38:02.267
Excuse me,
could we have some Irish stew?

38:02.333 --> 38:03.400
Tahlia.

38:04.933 --> 38:07.500
(laughs) I'm joking.

38:07.567 --> 38:11.700
The barman is really fit and
he's serving up my favourite,
stew.

38:11.767 --> 38:15.500
But Sophie is trying to set us
up
and it's really making us blush.

38:15.567 --> 38:18.300
Do you make this?
Yeah, every morning, me and my
mum.

38:18.367 --> 38:20.367
Aw! That's lovely!

38:20.433 --> 38:23.100
A man that wakes up with him mam
and cooks stew.

38:23.167 --> 38:26.033
Now, Tahlia,
that is your future husband.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.500
You're like a pirate.
Like, a Jack Sparrow vibe.

38:31.567 --> 38:34.967
A bit of a Mick Jagger pirate.
Yeah.

38:35.033 --> 38:36.233
What's happening?

38:36.300 --> 38:39.300
This is so awkward. I wanna
drown
myself in my Irish stew.

38:39.367 --> 38:42.000
Do you wanna come out with us
tonight? Oh, yeah.

38:42.067 --> 38:43.400
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!

38:43.467 --> 38:45.933
I don't think he knows
what he's in for. I know.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.233
The barman has agreed
to come out tonight.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.900
I just hope he brings a bowl
of his delicious stew.

38:50.967 --> 38:54.367
Sam, do you wanna come for a
chat?
OK, then.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.500
I don't wanna ruin everyone's
dinner

38:56.567 --> 38:59.300
but it's time I sorted things
out
with Sam.

39:01.433 --> 39:02.433
(sighs)

39:05.567 --> 39:08.767
Chloe's called me over for a
chat
and she's saying nothing.

39:08.833 --> 39:12.600
I'll have to be the bigger
person
and get to the bottom of this.

39:12.667 --> 39:16.633
You were disgusting last night.
What you've been saying to the
girls

39:16.700 --> 39:20.300
that you think that me and
Nathan
have got a thing going on.

39:20.367 --> 39:23.633
I don't think you have a thing
but you're cuddling and that.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.767
Yeah, it's banter,
but it's not funny.

39:25.833 --> 39:29.133
Do you know why?
Cos he's one of my best mates.
OK.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.967
Chloe has got double standards.

39:31.033 --> 39:33.833
She doesn't like how close
I'm getting with Nathan,

39:33.900 --> 39:36.900
but I only spend time with her
when she's not with Bethan.

39:36.967 --> 39:40.333
You know I love you so much.
You acted like a child last
night.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.967
I feel bad because I'm trying to
give you everything I possibly
can

39:44.033 --> 39:46.567
and you're throwing it in my
face
all the time.

39:46.633 --> 39:49.667
How can I tell Sam how I'm
feeling
when he's this angry?

39:49.733 --> 39:52.067
(exhales) I'm so annoyed.

39:52.133 --> 39:55.967
Why did you kick off last night?
I had too much to drink, that's
it.

39:56.933 --> 39:58.967
There must be a reason.
I was drunk.

39:59.033 --> 40:00.500
Cos you were drunk?
Mm-hmm.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.767
OK, so why have you not spoken
to me
all day?

40:02.833 --> 40:04.700
I haven't seen you. I've been...

40:04.767 --> 40:07.633
I've bumped into you loads.
You've not said a word.

40:07.700 --> 40:11.167
If you want a man's man,
now's your time to walk away.

40:11.233 --> 40:13.933
I think we should go on a break.
A break?

40:14.000 --> 40:16.133
Where the fuck has this come
from?

40:16.200 --> 40:18.433
I do. I think we should have
a bit of a break.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.567
OK. If that's what you want,
yeah.

40:22.833 --> 40:24.967
This conversation's over.

40:31.567 --> 40:35.567
I do really love Sam
and it really hurts us to say
this,

40:35.633 --> 40:39.233
but the break is for the best,
until I'm ready to open up to
him.

40:40.967 --> 40:42.400
(crying)

40:42.467 --> 40:45.500
I am fucking sick.
My fucking head's battered, man.

40:45.567 --> 40:47.167
I really am.

40:47.233 --> 40:48.533
I'm fucking sick.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.367
Oh, my God, this is way more
serious
than I thought.

40:51.433 --> 40:55.233
And I'm torn. I wanna be there
for Chloe but Sam is on his own

40:55.300 --> 40:56.933
and I need to see if he's OK.

40:58.267 --> 41:00.700
Nate, my head is battered.

41:02.300 --> 41:04.933
I literally don't even know
what to do right now.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.967
Before coming to Belfast,

41:07.033 --> 41:09.467
I was putting a massive effort
in
with Chloe

41:09.533 --> 41:11.500
to make our relationship better,

41:11.567 --> 41:13.767
and now I feel like
it could be over.

41:13.833 --> 41:15.600
I did not see this coming.

41:16.500 --> 41:19.067
I've got everything.
Why am I still miserable?

41:19.133 --> 41:20.433
Why am I kicking off?

41:20.500 --> 41:23.133
Sometimes you might think
you've got everything

41:23.200 --> 41:25.367
but they're just
materialistic things.

41:25.433 --> 41:28.867
What is important is how you
feel,
love and feelings.

41:28.933 --> 41:32.467
All my insecurities
keep fucking with my head.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.900
I keep picking.

41:34.967 --> 41:38.300
You know, he doesn't even know
why you are down.

41:38.367 --> 41:41.467
I have never, ever seen Chloe
this upset.

41:41.533 --> 41:44.733
There's obviously a lot more
going on than she's making out.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.233
I think Belfast could possibly
make or break their
relationship.

41:48.300 --> 41:52.567
I do think you need to let him
know
where your head's at.

41:52.633 --> 41:54.767
I know.
He's probably just as confused.

41:54.833 --> 41:57.867
He's probably thinking,
"What the fuck is going on?"

41:57.933 --> 41:59.433
Don't make us cry again.

42:05.367 --> 42:07.000
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

42:07.867 --> 42:11.133
You don't wanna ever tell
someone
that you're insecure,

42:11.200 --> 42:13.300
especially not your own partner.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.767
So embarrassing.

42:43.267 --> 42:45.133
Is Sam the one for ya?

42:45.200 --> 42:47.700
I dunno.
My head's fucking battered,
mate.

42:47.767 --> 42:50.867
I don't know why you're with me.
I'm really upset.

42:50.933 --> 42:54.000
This is the worst place that
me and Chloe have ever been in.

42:54.067 --> 42:55.433
I'm done.

42:55.500 --> 42:58.033
Stew man, come here.
I wanna slurp you up.

42:58.100 --> 42:59.667
That's lightened the mood.

42:59.733 --> 43:02.867
Howdy, howdy,
let's get fucking rowdy!

43:02.933 --> 43:04.333
Alex is like a boomerang.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.067
What the fuck?
I'm back in the UK.

43:07.133 --> 43:08.433
Is that a joke?

43:08.500 --> 43:12.033
I feel fucking terrible.
Why does Alex need to be here?
Wait.

43:13.267 --> 43:15.533
This house is never gonna be
the same again.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.000
# Everyone's here to party

43:19.067 --> 43:21.100
# If you wanna go wild
You wanna go wild

43:21.167 --> 43:22.567
# Everyone's here to party

43:22.633 --> 43:24.700
# If you wanna go wild
You wanna go

43:24.767 --> 43:26.200
# Everyone's here to party

43:26.267 --> 43:28.233
# If you wanna go wild
You wanna go wild

43:28.300 --> 43:30.000
# Everyone's here to party

43:30.067 --> 43:31.200
# Let's party, party

43:31.267 --> 43:33.000
# Wanna go wild
Let's party hard

43:33.067 --> 43:34.767
# Wanna go wild
Party, party

43:34.833 --> 43:36.433
# Wanna go wild
Party hard

43:36.500 --> 43:39.833
# Going hard, going hard, going
hard
Going hard, going hard #

43:42.433 --> 43:42.633
.
