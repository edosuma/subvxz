00:13.380 --> 00:15.315

00:15.382 --> 00:17.684

{\an8}some of other guys
who got laid off.

01:43.736 --> 01:44.838
{\an8}It's a support group.

01:44.904 --> 01:47.106
Like AA,
except everybody's drinking

01:47.173 --> 01:49.209
and feels totally fine about it.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.711
Okay, Tom, just tell me
what's going on.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.213
Okay.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.681
There's no support group.

01:54.747 --> 01:56.149
Hmm. I had a hunch.

01:56.216 --> 01:57.717
{\an1}Archie's been letting me
bowl for free.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.785
He's coaching me.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.687
I rolled a 268 last night.

02:00.753 --> 02:02.288
And that was with
an open frame.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.189
Great.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.124
Yeah, a 268 would put me
on the money list

02:05.191 --> 02:06.826
at any PBA tournament.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.360
Okay.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.430
Just saying.
If I had rolled that last night

02:10.497 --> 02:11.531
at the Del Taco Open,

02:11.598 --> 02:12.765
I would've made more money
in one day

02:12.832 --> 02:14.367
than two months at the factory.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.769
And we'd be knee-deep
in Del Taco.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.305
What are you saying?

02:19.372 --> 02:21.474
I'm saying I could make
good money in pro tournaments.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.711
I'm saying I'm tired of busting
my ass and us barely getting by.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.145
And Sam's right,

02:26.212 --> 02:27.647
Magic Squares suck.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.449
My family deserves Lucky Charms

02:29.516 --> 02:31.451
and full-price
laundry detergent.

02:31.518 --> 02:32.619
{\an3}Okay.

02:32.685 --> 02:35.889
I've heard you say you want
to be a professional bowler,

02:35.955 --> 02:37.390

you always meant it like

02:37.457 --> 02:39.292
when you say
you wish dogs could talk.

02:39.359 --> 02:42.462
I'm 35,
I didn't go to college,

02:42.529 --> 02:43.897
and the one job
I'm qualified to do

02:43.963 --> 02:45.198
just laid me off.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.699
I'm better at bowling

02:46.766 --> 02:47.934

Uh...

02:58.945 --> 03:01.848
Tuna casserole

There's also a gift card
in there for Bass Pro Shop.

03:05.552 --> 03:08.187
They're having a big sale
this weekend on bear spray.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.356
{\an1}We don't need
bear spray, Helen.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.225
Well, you'd be whistling
a different tune

03:12.292 --> 03:14.827
when some pot-smoking drifter
is breaking in.

03:15.628 --> 03:16.829
What? It won't kill him.

03:16.896 --> 03:18.398
It'll just take him down.

03:18.464 --> 03:21.234
Then you can decide
what to do with him later.

03:22.468 --> 03:24.203
Hey, have I come at a bad time?

03:24.837 --> 03:27.440
{\an3}Ooh.
How can I help?

03:29.475 --> 03:31.644
{\an6}We were just talking
about my job situation.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.644
{\an3}Uh-huh.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.613
Maybe I don't want to work
in a factory anymore, Ma.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.647
{\an3}What?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.215
Four generations of Smallwoods

03:36.282 --> 03:37.884

03:37.951 --> 03:40.320
The factory has been
very good to us.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.589
{\an3}Yeah, until the security
guard walked me to my car,

03:42.655 --> 03:44.591
cut up my ID and frisked me.

03:45.858 --> 03:47.594
I got to run Sam to school.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.695
Thanks for the casserole.

03:48.761 --> 03:49.796
Yeah.

03:49.862 --> 03:50.930
{\an1}While I was making it,
I realized

03:50.997 --> 03:52.532
{\an1}my furnace filters
need changing.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.901
Message received.
I'll swing by later.

in my backpack.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.300
Hiding? Why?

04:27.367 --> 04:29.302
Because I carried them
into school yesterday

04:29.369 --> 04:30.903
and there's already two guys
calling me "Ma'am"

04:30.970 --> 04:32.505
instead of "Sam."

04:33.339 --> 04:35.008
{\an3}No, hold on, no,
no, don't do that.

04:35.074 --> 04:37.310

Mom makes meatloaf,

we both say we love it?

04:47.787 --> 04:49.055
It was like that.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.290
Check it out.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.558
I bought this for you.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.660
I used my allowance.

buy one of these.

at the Mini Mart.

a grape-flavored cigar.

Sam, we don't solve our
problems with gambling.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.676

is three horseshoes

05:09.742 --> 05:11.344

I'm sorry, buddy.

your money back.

guy at the Mini Mart.

If I want to spend time

11:13.973 --> 11:16.042
a can of bear spray

11:29.755 --> 11:31.690
but I know you won.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.226
It was a recital,
not a competition.

11:34.293 --> 11:37.930
{\an3}Sam, you kicked everybody's ass
and I'm proud of you.

{\an1}Hey, Dad,

11:44.236 --> 11:47.406
{\an1}you know how we were talking
in the truck this morning?

11:47.473 --> 11:49.975
{\an1}I think this is
what I want to do.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.179
What'd you talk about
in the truck?

11:53.245 --> 11:55.981
Life, dreams, tap dance.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.450
Guy stuff.

11:59.351 --> 12:01.720
Tom, I know you're not thrilled

12:01.787 --> 12:03.155
about taking
that job at the plant.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.724
{\an3}Actually, I think I figured
something out tonight.

12:05.791 --> 12:08.094
When we got to the recital,
I was pissed.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.097
I know. But I think that lady
had the parking space first.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.432
{\an3}Not that, and no,
she didn't.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.768
The turn signal is a contract.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.038
{\an3}I was pissed
about not bowling.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.507
I always thought that's what
I was supposed to do in life.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.808
Sitting in that theater,

12:22.875 --> 12:24.176
thinking,
"This is my last chance,

12:24.243 --> 12:27.780
and as soon as I take
that new job, it's gone."

12:28.948 --> 12:31.283
Then my kid takes the stage.

12:31.350 --> 12:32.451
Got my arm around my wife.

12:32.518 --> 12:33.452
And I realize,

12:33.519 --> 12:35.454
I'm not a pro bowler.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.990
{\an3}I'm a dad
and a husband.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.024
That's what I am.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.794
I don't have to be
anything else.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.396
Tell me I'm wrong.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.468
{\an1}I wish I could,
but I can't.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.871
And that's okay.

12:52.471 --> 12:53.973
You know,

12:54.039 --> 12:55.875
{\an3}everybody thinks the hardest
thing to do in bowling

12:55.941 --> 12:57.409
is to pick up
the 7-10 split.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.178
But it's not.

12:59.245 --> 13:02.014
It's actually
the 4-6-7-9-10 split.

13:02.081 --> 13:04.216
{\an3}It's called
the Greek Church.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.384

13:05.451 --> 13:07.520
can pick that up
on their best day.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.822
I did it one night.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.891
Then I go to this bar.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.260
See this... beautiful girl.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.295
{\an3}Way out of
my league.

"Greek Church" confidence.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.369

13:23.435 --> 13:26.105
{\an3}Month later,
she's pregnant.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.406
Week after that,

13:27.473 --> 13:29.041
married at the courthouse.

17:26.811 --> 17:29.214
Oh, I had a guy let me cut
in front of him

17:29.281 --> 17:30.616
in line at
the grocery store today.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.484
Gonna stick with what works.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.361
{\an5}Hey, how was your, uh...

17:40.125 --> 17:42.361
{\an1}Sit.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.465
I have two questions.

17:46.532 --> 17:47.699
Question one.

17:47.766 --> 17:49.334
Why is there
a can of bear spray

17:49.401 --> 17:51.336
duct-taped to
the back of our toilet?

17:52.838 --> 17:54.339
I'll take care of it.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.408
Great. Question two.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.778
Why are you taking a job
you don't want?

17:59.845 --> 18:01.113
What do you mean, "don't want"?

18:01.180 --> 18:03.215
I get to drive 1,046 bolts

18:03.282 --> 18:04.650
into brake drums every day.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.452
And they let me wear a hairnet.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.556
{\an1}You're doing it because
it's the right thing

18:10.622 --> 18:11.590
to do for our family.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.225
Yes, we talked about this.

18:13.292 --> 18:14.660
{\an1}We did.

18:14.726 --> 18:16.428
And I thought a lot about it.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.131
{\an1}You should do
the right thing for our family.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.333
So here's the plan.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.836
{\an1}You have a 210 bowling average
in your last 36 games

18:23.902 --> 18:25.204
of league play.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.872
This qualifies you
for PBA membership.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.540
{\an1}You'll start doing
regional tournaments.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.709
The first one is in three
months at Cuyahoga Falls.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.644
{\an1}Horrible town.
Enjoy.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.480
{\an1}Now,

18:34.546 --> 18:36.448
uh, if you don't place
in the top third,

18:36.515 --> 18:38.817
we get nothing and we lose our
entry fee, which is bad. But...

18:38.884 --> 18:40.385
{\an1}if you can win
just one regional,

18:40.452 --> 18:41.820
{\an1}it covers all of
your bowling expenses

18:41.887 --> 18:42.888
till the end of the year.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.289
{\an6}Jen...

18:42.955 --> 18:44.289
Don't interrupt, babe.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.693
The ultimate goal is, of course,
to win a major.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.428
You'll earn exemption
so you can enter

18:49.495 --> 18:50.295
any PBA event you want

18:50.362 --> 18:52.631
and ideally bowl
in the PBA Championship.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.333
No, honey, stop.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.635
I'm fine.
I don't need to do this.

18:56.702 --> 18:58.403
Actually, you do.

18:59.371 --> 19:03.175
{\an1}You're not the only one
in this family with a dream.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.177
{\an1}Your son wants
to dance on Broadway.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.145
{\an1}You need to show him
what's possible.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.714
I want to open my own salon.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.148
{\an1}I'm gonna need you
to finish in the top ten

19:10.215 --> 19:11.583
{\an1}at a major
to make that happen.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.519
I mapped out driving routes,

19:13.585 --> 19:14.853
budgeted motel costs,

19:14.920 --> 19:16.255
gas money.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.723
With me picking up extra shifts,

19:17.789 --> 19:18.790
we can go for six months.

19:18.857 --> 19:20.893
And after that, we reassess.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.763
Sweetie, I... I can't do it.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.898
I thought you'd say that.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.800
{\an1}So I stopped off
at the bowling alley

19:28.867 --> 19:30.736
{\an1}after work
to talk to Archie.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.305
He helped me pick this out.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.511
{\an1}If you're gonna be
a pro bowler,

19:39.578 --> 19:41.346
{\an1}you can't keep using
that crappy, chipped-up ball

19:41.413 --> 19:42.648
{\an1}you've had for
the last ten years.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.250
{\an1}Oh. We'll be selling the
snow blower to pay for it.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.785
{\an1}You'll be shoveling
this winter,

19:46.852 --> 19:48.954
{\an1}but Archie said
you could lose a few pounds.

19:51.423 --> 19:54.326
Guy gives you curly fries
for 30 years, calls you fat.

19:55.294 --> 19:57.229
Try the holes, babe.

19:57.296 --> 19:59.364
{\an1}Already drilled.
No returns.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.904
What if it doesn't work out?

20:05.971 --> 20:08.674
But what if it does?

20:08.740 --> 20:10.576
{\an1}Look...

20:10.642 --> 20:12.644
you and your mom had
a tough life.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.447
You lost some important things.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.683
But you married me.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.484
And I say

20:19.551 --> 20:21.853
why can't we be
the family who wins?

20:23.855 --> 20:25.324
{\an1}Do you know how many wives
there are

20:25.390 --> 20:27.225
who'd say,
"Forget the paying job,

20:27.292 --> 20:29.394
just bowl
and see what happens"?

20:29.461 --> 20:30.696
{\an1}One.

20:30.762 --> 20:32.431
{\an1}There is one
and you married her.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.367
You won the lottery. I suggest
you cash in your ticket.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.005
What's wrong?

20:40.839 --> 20:42.507
I have to shovel this winter.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.942
Why?

20:45.310 --> 20:47.346
'Cause I got
my third horseshoe.

20:50.716 --> 20:51.917
{\an1}Gross.
