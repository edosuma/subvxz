(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:18.561 --> 00:21.974
-She got fired.
-What'd she do this time?

00:22.064 --> 00:23.929
Well, she was washing dishes
in the kitchen,

00:24.025 --> 00:25.014
but then she told the manager

00:25.109 --> 00:26.224
-she wanted to be a wait--
-Dona?

00:27.904 --> 00:30.486
-Roger.
-Hey, how long you been back?

00:31.157 --> 00:32.442
A couple days.

00:32.825 --> 00:34.656
You look good all changed up.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.373
I know your folks
glad to have you back.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.625
Yeah, they are.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.793
Son, can we get our food today?

00:48.174 --> 00:49.459
It's really good seeing you.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.124
You, too.

00:54.889 --> 00:55.878
He's sweet.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.723
Always was.
Why'd you break up with him?

00:59.810 --> 01:01.311
Had things I wanted to do.

01:02.313 --> 01:04.224
Besides, I got a man.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.306
Now, you see how
he taking care of me.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.233
-He must be rich.
-He ain't starving, that's for sure.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.026
-Pssh.
-You guys want a refill?

01:11.113 --> 01:12.193
Oh, yes, thank you.

01:13.199 --> 01:14.609
Y'a|| should come back with me.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.407
And be a model like you?
You dreaming.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.406
Maybe you ain't dreaming enough.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.739
I ain't even know I was alive
till lwent up there.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.448
I'm a country girl
through and through.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.872
Plus, I like eating too much.

01:26.963 --> 01:29.420
I heard that
them New York models

01:29.507 --> 01:31.623
got to have sex with whoever's
doing the hiring.

01:32.218 --> 01:34.379
-That's true?
-Not if you don't want to.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.710
What about you?

01:37.098 --> 01:38.804
I do what I want, when I want.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.886
You come back with me,
you see how it can work.

01:47.483 --> 01:48.814
So, did you hear
about Leon Davidson?

01:49.110 --> 01:50.395
He wrecked his daddy's Mustang.

01:50.486 --> 01:51.692
Drove it right into a ditch.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.064
What? Does Nancy know?

01:53.155 --> 01:55.612
No, girl, I heard
he was with some other girl

01:55.700 --> 01:57.361
he met down in Charlotte.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.493
-Oh, my God, Nancy know?
-Where you going?

02:01.205 --> 02:04.948
-Outside for a little.
-So, did Nancy find out?

02:05.042 --> 02:07.454
Oh, yeah, she is mad at him.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.636
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.094
Pretty day.

02:27.523 --> 02:28.979
I guess.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.817
I heard you talking back there.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.315
You a model?

02:39.493 --> 02:40.573
Yeah.

02:41.454 --> 02:42.614
In New York.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.112
New York City?

02:48.127 --> 02:49.287
Damn.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.914
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

04:23.180 --> 04:24.886
(MOANING) Yeah.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.981
(GRUNTS)

04:38.696 --> 04:39.811
Okay.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.285
Been a while, huh?

04:48.372 --> 04:49.657
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

04:49.957 --> 04:52.869
-Feel 10 pounds lighter.
-Yeah, I bet you do.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.752
All right, GI. Joe, up and out.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.455
I need the room.

05:10.769 --> 05:14.512
Mmm, no, I'm not a whoremaster.

05:14.607 --> 05:17.565
Nobody said you were,
but, Vince, come on.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.939
This guy is offering to set us up
with another business!

05:21.030 --> 05:22.861
-Am I right?
-Us?

05:22.948 --> 05:26.111
Whether thou goest--
Wait, is it whether or whither?

05:26.202 --> 05:27.863
What the fuck do I know
about a massage parlor?

05:28.829 --> 05:29.909
So you'll learn.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.237
Or, shit, l'll learn.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.118
All right? I'll be the pussy hound.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.666
All you gotta do
is say yes to Rudy.

05:35.753 --> 05:37.459
It'll be clean work for you.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.458
-Clean work.
-Hey, do you mind?

05:40.549 --> 05:42.164
You should've stayed put at Kim's.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.004
Once you start saying yes
to these guys--

05:44.094 --> 05:47.461
I can say no to Rudy on this.
And I'm gonna.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.387
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
little brother, come on.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.090
Just slow down, here.
Let's talk about it.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.425
I got a question for you.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.844
What, you got an opinion
on this, too?

05:54.939 --> 05:58.852
Korean entree. Bi bim blank.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.478
Bap. lt's bim bup-- Bap.
lt's bap.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.483
-Bap?
-B-A-P.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.573
In like Flynn. All right.

06:08.661 --> 06:11.403
I got enough on my hands
with this here.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.488
Which reminds me. Hey.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.368
You put us
into the bar guides yet?

06:15.459 --> 06:17.074
-Thanks.
-Yeah, we're in.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.499
The gay one, too?
What's it called? Michael's Stick?

06:20.589 --> 06:21.829
(SCOFFS)

06:22.258 --> 06:23.247
(CHUCKLES) Michael's Thing.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.331
Whatever.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.963
You know, it might help
if we place a few ads, too.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.089
I checked the rates.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.681
They're not bad for a half-page.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.630
Okay, draw something up.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.431
-Me?
-Yeah.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.226
-I can't draw.
-I thought all you guys were artistic.

06:37.648 --> 06:38.637
MIKE: I'll do it.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.522
You got the time?

06:42.653 --> 06:43.859
l'll fit it in my schedule.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.520
I know a few of the women now.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.446
They get a little hinky
when their pimps are around,

06:48.534 --> 06:50.650
but if you catch them alone,
they talk.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.154
After that,
I wanna talk to the pimps.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.828
Also alone,
run interviews side by side.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.531
He says, she says.
Contrast and compare.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.493
Black pimps misusing white girls
from wherever?

07:00.588 --> 07:03.830
I can deliver near as many black women
being pimped as white.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.462
Sandra, all we're doing
is reinforcing the stereotypes,

07:07.553 --> 07:10.886
just like those goddamn ghetto flicks
out there now.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.679
Everybody cheering
for the pusherman.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.848
I'm giving you life as lived.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.345
We have Les Matthews for that.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.351
He's got the street stuff covered.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.097
And his copy reads smooth.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.357
But this, it's not news.

07:24.945 --> 07:29.188
-lt's not for us.
-Oh, right. Uplift only.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.159
Sorry.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.788
We stand up for our own, Sandra.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.325
At least let me write something longer

07:41.420 --> 07:43.081
and show it to you.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.917
-He's gonna notice money's missing.
-Don't worry about that.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.923
-But how much do I take?
-Just don't give him all of it.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.379
Well, how much?

07:58.103 --> 07:59.559
Excuse me.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.810
Hey. What are you doing
hanging around here?

08:03.901 --> 08:04.981
Waiting for somebody.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.691
l'm flattered, but I'm not gonna get
out of here for hours.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.155
Somebody else.

08:15.079 --> 08:16.114
Mystery date?

08:17.039 --> 08:18.779
Mystery to you, maybe.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.582
Hey, what can I get you?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.914
I'm looking for Abby.
She works here.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.541
Uh-huh. Abby.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.080
Hey, Evan.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.091
Is that it?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.258
That's him.

08:32.596 --> 08:33.631
That's what I said.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.349
Okay. See you later.

08:43.399 --> 08:45.310
I got your camera back from Darryl.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.307
Cool. I've been missing it.

08:51.115 --> 08:52.230
Keep it for me.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.239
Hey, you two kids
have a swell time, okay?

09:00.416 --> 09:01.405
Hey.

09:02.418 --> 09:03.658
Think he's good-looking?

09:04.253 --> 09:05.459
He's not my type.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.083
Yeah, well, pretend you're her.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.006
He's nothing special.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.421
Yeah, exactly.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.629
JACK: Oh, Jesus, Eileen.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.008
Let me... Let me do it.

09:21.729 --> 09:25.096
Oh. Like that?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.977
Yeah. Yes, just like that.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.695
-Yeah.
-Oh.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.241
(BOTH LAUGH)

11:54.256 --> 11:55.587
I told you three.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.164
You told me three last night.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.795
Every night three.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.254
Till Darlene gets back, the two of you

12:00.345 --> 12:01.960
are gonna have to start
making up for the losses.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.337
Where the hell is Darlene, anyway?

12:03.432 --> 12:05.673

with where Darlene at.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.345

-Oh, you gonna start bitching, too?

12:13.191 --> 12:14.476
Can we put that toward tomorrow?

12:15.152 --> 12:16.938
Hey, that's what
I'm talking about.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.644
You start busting it like that,

12:18.739 --> 12:20.900
you could take a whole snow day.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.857
I'll make it up tomorrow.

Come on, Larry.

to walk on your hands, bitch.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.350
That was different.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.225
For you, maybe.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.439
Yeah. I guess for me, yeah.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.783
All's well that ends well, right?

13:10.499 --> 13:11.488
You're different.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.666
How so?

13:18.882 --> 13:20.964
Well, I meant that
as a compliment.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.416
Okay.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.553
But how did you mean it?

13:29.893 --> 13:30.882
As a good thing.

Good how?

a get-together at his place,

13:52.666 --> 13:54.327

Where are you going?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.885
I got an early morning tomorrow.

14:12.144 --> 14:15.477
Oh, okay, well, maybe next time,
we'll stay at your place.

14:15.564 --> 14:20.024
It'd be nice to sleep in the same bed
and have some breakfast.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.309
Yeah.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.573
But now I gotta go.

14:25.657 --> 14:29.525
Oh, um, at least
let me get you a cab.

-No, really.

a bad number.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.965
-Really bad.
-Party's a bummer.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.342
We should find a movie.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.389
-How bad?
-74.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.638
No way I stay clear of the draft board
with a number that low.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.345
-You seen that book they got, 4-F?
-Yeah, read every page.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.603
Shit, I'm hoping McGovern can get in
and end the fucking war.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.769
Me, too.
So, why the army jacket?

15:05.489 --> 15:06.478
lrony.

15:06.907 --> 15:10.240
-Everybody wears them.
-Everybody's ironic, huh?

15:10.327 --> 15:12.989
l was thinking of going for
a creative writing master's next year,

15:13.080 --> 15:14.911
but when I told
my father, he said,

15:14.998 --> 15:17.114

53:29.415 --> 53:30.791
I'll leave you to it.

53:35.671 --> 53:36.831
You know my fee, right?

53:38.049 --> 53:39.880
-Twenty an hour?
-Twenty?

53:41.094 --> 53:44.336
You see me in coveralls,
cow shit on my shoes?

53:45.264 --> 53:46.253
Forty.

53:49.977 --> 53:51.683
Time is money, baby.

53:51.771 --> 53:54.558
Pretty girl like you
gots to know that, right?

53:55.024 --> 53:56.560
That the first rule of pimping?

53:56.651 --> 53:59.017
First rule of pimping
is look a man in his eyes

53:59.112 --> 54:00.318
when you're talking to him.

54:02.532 --> 54:03.988
-Got it.
-Mmm.

54:06.994 --> 54:08.074
Forty.

54:16.504 --> 54:18.620
She got you all fucked up, partner.

54:18.714 --> 54:20.215
I can see.

54:20.299 --> 54:22.881
-She's in your head.
-lt's just a favor.

54:23.386 --> 54:24.546
Yeah.

54:26.973 --> 54:28.679
-(TIRES SCREECHING)
-Whoa!

54:30.935 --> 54:33.517
You know, it's customary
to signal your intentions

54:33.604 --> 54:36.687
before pulling your vehicle
into traffic, Officer Flan-a-gan.

54:36.774 --> 54:38.560
lt's customary
to signal your intentions

54:38.651 --> 54:41.688
before licking my hairy lrish ass,
Officer Haddix.

54:41.779 --> 54:44.361
Sweeney took the day tomorrow,
so juice flows today.

54:44.449 --> 54:47.407
He wanted to get to you before
you went end of tour and missed him.

54:47.493 --> 54:49.279
All right? Behave yourselves.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.366
Guys are fucking testifying
on this shit downtown,

54:56.461 --> 54:58.952
and this asshole's tossing envelopes
around in the street.

54:59.046 --> 55:00.502
Guess they figure the worst is over.

55:00.590 --> 55:02.205
That's what I heard.

55:02.300 --> 55:03.380
From who?

55:04.719 --> 55:07.586
Steaks tonight. Tad's, maybe?

55:07.680 --> 55:11.218
-I might have dinner plans.
-Oh, shit. (CHUCKLES)

55:17.773 --> 55:19.604
So, why'd you change your mind?

55:24.864 --> 55:26.229
So, what, you got anything?

55:27.158 --> 55:29.365
Or there's still no film
in the camera?

55:29.952 --> 55:31.408
Matter of fact,
there's been a change.

55:34.540 --> 55:35.655
In the law.

55:35.750 --> 55:36.990
Or the way they're reading it.

55:37.084 --> 55:38.585
That's what my lawyer
is telling me.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.580
Something about community standards.

55:41.547 --> 55:43.333
What about community standards?

55:44.967 --> 55:46.468
Apparently, New York has none.

55:47.512 --> 55:49.673
(CHUCKLES) So, you're back to filming?

55:50.765 --> 55:52.096
When do we start?

55:54.685 --> 55:56.721
From the looks of it,
you might need a couple weeks.

55:58.231 --> 55:59.767
How's Wednesday after next?

56:01.609 --> 56:02.644
Great.

56:05.613 --> 56:06.944
-Hey, Ralphie.
-Hey, Bobby.

56:07.031 --> 56:09.397
-Oh, that looks good.
-Yeah, thank you.

56:10.243 --> 56:12.700
I figured about two foot per person,

56:12.787 --> 56:14.618
so that's room for five, maybe six.

56:15.915 --> 56:17.780
-Right here?
-Yeah, looks fine.

56:17.875 --> 56:18.910
Your guys do good work.

56:19.001 --> 56:20.707
As always, pays to go with the union.

56:39.146 --> 56:41.398
We fill the bowl with water
so the girls can...

56:42.191 --> 56:43.727
I get it. I got it.

56:43.818 --> 56:45.524
Anyway, by the end of the month,

56:45.611 --> 56:47.442
the only thing will be missing
will be women.

56:48.239 --> 56:49.274
AII right. (EXHALES)

56:49.365 --> 56:50.650
I'll talk to Frankie,
he can talk it up

56:50.741 --> 56:52.242
with the pimps he plays cards with.

56:52.326 --> 56:53.611
Okay.

56:54.036 --> 56:55.367
I gotta get home, your sister's got

56:55.454 --> 56:58.196
some kind of TuppenNare festival
happening tonight.

57:02.962 --> 57:04.168
Later, Vin.

57:06.465 --> 57:07.454
MAN: Here.

57:29.864 --> 57:31.400
