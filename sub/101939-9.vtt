Used to be three palm trees up there.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.444
I remember I kicked your ass
around that corner.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.488
[Daniel] Yeah? How'd that end?

11:38.406 --> 11:39.740
Hey, how are you? Thanks.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.087
Wow. This is…

11:54.380 --> 11:57.842

I had a pool twice the size of this.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.437
I bet you did.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.314
What's that supposed to mean?

12:12.815 --> 12:15.985
Must have been nice
having a rich daddy give you everything.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.238
I didn't have a rich daddy.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.116
Had a rich stepdad.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.493
He was a real piece of shit.

12:25.870 --> 12:26.954
I didn't know that.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.083
Yeah, I guess my mom wanted me
to have a better life,

[Lucille] <i>I really think</i>

12:35.880 --> 12:38.632
I have a very positive feeling.
I'm telling you, Daniel.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.677
Yeah, moms are good like that.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.474
I could use a drink.
There's a bar around the corner.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.685
It's the middle of the afternoon.
We gotta go back and do the paperwork.

I'm inviting everyone.

I wanted to call to say
that I apologize for earlier today.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.395
I was feeling off,

14:15.771 --> 14:18.440
but I really would love to see you today.

Cobra Kai's throwing a party
at the Canyon.

We're heading out there right now.

No, man, but I heard
he flipped the bat to the moon.

with my buddies from work.

That's my frickin' kid right there.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.366
Yeah, I still need to see it.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.076
It's required by law.

Oh yeah, for sure. Just upholding the law.

OK, one drink,
then we get the hell out of here.

So…

16:46.338 --> 16:48.173
your stepdad was an asshole, huh?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.510
Back in the day,
I just figured you were living the life.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.804
You know, fancy cars, motorbikes…

16:54.346 --> 16:55.681
It had its moments.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.727
Then I'd come home
and pretty much get bullied every day.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.312
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.316
That's why I joined Cobra Kai.

Kreese gave me more attention
than I ever got at home.

He was basically… a father.

You just gotta feel the energy

23:17.229 --> 23:19.147
and just live in the moment, you know?

23:22.692 --> 23:25.487
That is the most McConaughey thing
I've ever heard.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.246
Live the moment.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.292
[exhales nervously]

23:40.252 --> 23:41.962
Well, uh, hello there.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.340
I saw on your Facebook it's your birthday.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.551
Happy birthday!

23:49.803 --> 23:51.638
-Sorry if I'm bothering you.
-[clears throat]

23:51.721 --> 23:55.058
I don't normally converse
with the opposite sex.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.185
Well, except for my mom.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.439
Even then, it's a bit intimidating.

24:02.232 --> 24:06.111
My move is usually
to just watch from a distance, you know?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.697
Not in a creepy stalker way.

24:09.072 --> 24:12.617
Consider me more of an admirer from afar.

24:12.701 --> 24:13.952
Oh my God. [sighs]

24:14.035 --> 24:15.078
These losers.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.874
That went pretty well.

24:20.667 --> 24:21.751
Hey!

24:21.835 --> 24:23.837
You think it's funny crashing my party?

24:24.254 --> 24:26.631
It's not really your party
'cause we were here first.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.758
Yeah, well, I know you

24:28.842 --> 24:31.136
and your little karate gang
think you're cool,

24:31.720 --> 24:33.847
but we all remember who you really are.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.727
You're just a fugly bitch,
and your friends are all freaks.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.396
Come on, Moon. Let's go.

24:41.897 --> 24:42.939
No, I'm staying.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.444
I apologized to Aisha for what we did,
and you should too.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.447
Whatever.

24:51.406 --> 24:52.574
You deserve them, Moon.

24:54.743 --> 24:55.744
[Aisha] Hey, Yasmine!

24:57.245 --> 24:58.788
Huh? What?

24:59.289 --> 25:00.707
Let me help you to your car.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.960
[screams]

25:04.044 --> 25:05.462
No mercy, bitch!

25:05.545 --> 25:08.381
[partygoers laughing]

25:09.216 --> 25:10.717
[partygoers jeering]

25:19.851 --> 25:21.019
OK.

25:21.603 --> 25:22.562
[laughs]

25:22.646 --> 25:24.731
I like to drive fast, but that was crazy.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.024
We're lucky we're alive.

25:26.107 --> 25:29.027
[chuckles] Sorry, I just…
I know Miguel's been waiting for me.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.322
So you're a little late. Big deal.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.199
He shouldn't give you
a hard time about it.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.283
It's not just that.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.161
Um… thanks.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.997
I haven't told my dad
that I'm dating Miguel,

25:41.081 --> 25:43.959
and I think Miguel knows now
that I'm keeping it a secret.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.502
So it's been kind of awkward.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.171
Why have you been keeping it a secret?

25:49.881 --> 25:52.259
Because my dad hates Miguel's sensei.

25:52.717 --> 25:54.386
Like, with a passion.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.639
And I know if he found out,
he would totally lose his shit.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.892
But I just feel so guilty.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.770
Like, I've gotta come clean to everyone.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.399
Sorry, I know this sounds like
a total soap opera.

26:07.482 --> 26:08.567
No. [chuckles]

26:09.901 --> 26:10.819
I can relate.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.409
[Samantha] I need help with this.

26:17.492 --> 26:18.577
[both laughing]

26:18.660 --> 26:21.288
OK, it's actually a little more steep
than I was expecting.

26:23.456 --> 26:26.585
OK. I'm pretty sure
I couldn't come down that hill on my own.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.295
Your dad said I should be a gentleman.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.838
-Oh, is that so?
-Hey.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.423
-[Samantha] Hey.
-[Miguel] Hey!

26:32.132 --> 26:34.092
-Who's this guy?
-Hey, I…

26:34.175 --> 26:35.260
Wait, this…

26:36.011 --> 26:37.512
This is your boyfriend?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.055
Yeah. Miguel, relax.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.682
This is Robby.
He works for my dad.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.852
Oh, with your dad.
OK, that makes a lot of sense.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.770
What is that supposed to mean?

26:46.521 --> 26:47.897
Wait. Have you been drinking?

26:49.190 --> 26:50.275
[chuckles] No, no.

26:50.358 --> 26:54.904
You don't get to turn this on me.
I texted and called you all day,

26:55.322 --> 26:58.033
-and you couldn't answer me back once?
-No, I literally couldn't.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.827
-My mom took my phone.
-Oh, that's so convenient.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.330
-Hey, man, just tell--
-You get out of here!

27:03.413 --> 27:04.289
Miguel, stop it.

27:05.081 --> 27:07.459
-Hey, man, you wanna try that again?
-Try it again, huh?

27:07.542 --> 27:08.418
-Don't!

27:08.501 --> 27:10.170
-[Sam grunts]
-[partygoers gasp]

27:10.253 --> 27:12.964
-Sam, look, I'm sorry.
-[Sam] God, you asshole!

27:13.423 --> 27:14.591
What the hell was that?

27:16.176 --> 27:17.636
My dad was right about Cobra Kai.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.681
Good luck at the tournament.
I won't be there.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.559
Sam… [groans]

27:25.060 --> 27:27.020
[Robby] Sam! Sam, wait!

27:27.812 --> 27:28.647
Hey!

27:35.945 --> 27:39.157
Sober my ass. You're lucky
there were no cops on the road.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.369
-Ah, save it for the mat.
-Hey, I didn't say yes.

27:42.452 --> 27:43.912
Oh, come on. One time.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.997
You know, like the end of <i>Rocky III.</i>

27:46.081 --> 27:48.291
Yeah, when Rocky and Apollo fight for fun.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.501
Yeah.<i> </i>OK, all right.

27:49.584 --> 27:50.960
One time and one time only.

27:51.044 --> 27:51.961
It is on.

27:53.838 --> 27:54.923
Hey, Robby.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.218
Mr. LaRusso, I really need to talk to you
about something.

27:58.635 --> 27:59.511
What the hell?

28:00.428 --> 28:02.430
-What's going on?
<i>-</i>Hey, Johnny, I forgot to tell you.

28:02.514 --> 28:06.017
You're not the only one with a student.
I have a student of my own.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.603
[grunts loudly]

28:09.062 --> 28:11.189
-What the hell's wrong with you?
-What's wrong with you?

28:11.272 --> 28:12.357
Hey, Dad, back off.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.526
-"Dad"?
-If you wanna fight him,

28:14.609 --> 28:16.277
you're gonna have to fight me first.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.616
You gotta be kidding me.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.037
[Daniel panting]

28:26.121 --> 28:26.996
Wha…

28:31.584 --> 28:34.671
-Mr. LaRusso, I was gonna tell you.
-Was this all just a con?

28:35.004 --> 28:37.424
Some kind of sick mind game
you're trying to pull off on me?

28:37.507 --> 28:39.718
-No, it wasn't like that.
-You lied to me.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.052
-Please. Please--
-Get out, now!

28:41.136 --> 28:44.472
And don't come back to this house,
not to the dealership, not ever.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.932
You got that? Ever again!

28:46.015 --> 28:46.891
[Robby] I'm sor--

28:51.646 --> 28:53.648
[engine revs loudly]

28:54.691 --> 28:56.109
[tires screech]

28:59.904 --> 29:00.864
[sighs]

29:14.335 --> 29:16.129
[electronic music plays]
