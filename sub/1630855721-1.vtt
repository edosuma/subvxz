[siren continues]

00:55.555 --> 00:57.490
[fast-paced dramatic music]

01:04.798 --> 01:05.765
Take them down!

01:10.003 --> 01:11.471
[gun firing continues]

01:16.876 --> 01:17.811
[gun firing stops]

01:24.117 --> 01:25.585
[Damien] Come here, let's go.

01:39.065 --> 01:40.266
I need you to stay low.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.102
Move to another hiding spot, okay?

01:43.503 --> 01:47.307
We're gonna get out of here. You need to let me go, and do as I say.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.010
Hey.

01:51.144 --> 01:52.745
It's gonna be okay.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.285
Okay, now go.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.189
[dramatic music]

02:17.804 --> 02:19.806
[man 1 screaming at a distance]

02:30.250 --> 02:31.618
[shuddering in pain]

02:35.822 --> 02:38.091
-Medic! -[commander] Don't bother.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.726
We have to help him.

02:41.261 --> 02:42.395
We can't.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.467
What happened?

02:48.501 --> 02:50.503
[commander] The prisoner happened.

02:51.037 --> 02:52.205
Get up.

02:53.806 --> 02:55.909
[men screaming at a distance]

03:11.457 --> 03:12.859
What the hell is happening?

03:14.160 --> 03:16.229
Keep calm and focus.

03:17.096 --> 03:18.665
We're being hunted.

03:18.965 --> 03:20.500
[twig snaps]

03:30.643 --> 03:31.978
Where's your brother?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.483
[screaming in pain]

[mystical grim tone]

Experimental trash.

[mystical grim tone]

04:56.596 --> 04:58.498
[strained groaning]

05:04.537 --> 05:05.705
[exclaims]

05:11.344 --> 05:13.146
You know that's not gonna work, that's not gonna work.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.647
I have to try. [sobs]

05:14.781 --> 05:16.983
No. Sirona, you have to get out of here.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.618
Please.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.453
Or all this is for nothing.

05:21.754 --> 05:22.722
I can't.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.458
Sirona, please.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.765
Just get to safety, okay?

05:36.369 --> 05:37.570
You're gonna be okay.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.439
It's gonna be okay.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.240
I...

05:41.374 --> 05:42.575
I love you.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.510
[somber music]

05:47.246 --> 05:48.915
D-- Damien.

05:51.884 --> 05:52.985
[sobs]

05:56.089 --> 05:58.091
[man 2 screaming] Got a man down!

06:03.596 --> 06:05.031
I love you, too.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.427
[dramatic music]

06:52.245 --> 06:53.546
I don't see anything.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.215
[whispering] That's 'cause you're blind, dude.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.317
[whispering] Shut up, Tuck.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.553
Both of you, knock it off.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.455
Stay focused.

07:09.662 --> 07:10.797
Got it.

07:15.835 --> 07:16.803
[Cross] Perfect.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.237
Tuck, take the package.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.939
Miller, you're on our six.

07:20.406 --> 07:21.541
Let's move.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.249
Campbell, got eyes on anything?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.952
Nothing yet. Keep your eyes peeled.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.620
They might be wearing ghillie suits.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.122
[Cross on transceiver] Copy.

07:36.889 --> 07:38.257
Useless as always.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.827
That's enough, Miller. Let's go.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.799
[Cross] Eagle One, this is Bravo team.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.001
We have the package and are ready for exfil.

07:49.135 --> 07:49.902
Over.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.507
[man 3] Copy that, Bravo team. ETA to assault is ten minutes.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.015
Anyone else think this is too easy?

08:06.085 --> 08:07.687
[Cross on transceiver] Campbell, report.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.324
Still no signs of movement.

08:11.891 --> 08:12.892
Well, stay sharp.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.727
We know they're out there.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.236
[gunshot]

08:26.405 --> 08:27.807
Miller, you okay?

08:27.940 --> 08:29.108
What do you think?

08:36.249 --> 08:37.416
Stay down, boys.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.887
Game over. [chuckles]

08:41.320 --> 08:42.688
Stand down, Sharp.

08:42.822 --> 08:43.723
Drill's over.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.424
[Sharp on transceiver] Copy that.

08:45.558 --> 08:46.826
[chuckles lightly]

08:49.896 --> 08:50.897
[yells] What the hell was that?

08:51.030 --> 08:53.065
Got to keep it realistic for you.

08:53.666 --> 08:54.667
[chuckles wickedly]

08:54.800 --> 08:56.035
[Tuck strains]

08:56.569 --> 08:57.703
It's only a training round, Miller.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.205
Don't be such a bitch.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.207
-[gunshot] -[grunts]

09:03.376 --> 09:04.210
It's only a training round.

09:04.343 --> 09:05.945
Don't be such a bitch!

09:09.081 --> 09:10.516
And where the hell were you?

09:10.816 --> 09:12.718
Take it easy on her, Miller.

09:13.686 --> 09:14.954
Maybe if she had situational awareness,

09:15.087 --> 09:17.023
we'd have a partner we could rely on.

09:17.423 --> 09:18.524
It's just a scrimmage.

09:19.091 --> 09:22.228
Besides, she's got one flaw that she can't fix.

09:22.361 --> 09:23.429
What's that?

09:23.563 --> 09:25.398
You ain't me, sweet cheeks.

09:25.531 --> 09:26.732
[scoffs]

09:27.767 --> 09:30.469
Nobody wouldn't be, you stupid prick.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.038
Wanna run that by me again?

09:32.171 --> 09:33.940
Yeah. I said you're a prick.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.676
You had the drop on me, but you shot me anyway.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.344
No pain, no gain.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.647
Maybe she should be better prepared next time.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.849
Might save her life in the field.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.124
Hey, you hurt?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.859
You mean besides my pride?

09:53.993 --> 09:56.762
Ah, he's always been jealous of you.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.599
I think since you started improving at the range,

09:59.732 --> 10:01.167
it's starting to bother him.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.835
Enough to shoot me?

10:03.569 --> 10:06.105
I'll set him straight, and if that doesn't work,

10:06.238 --> 10:09.775
you have my permission to shoot him with a live round.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.550
What's on your mind, son?

10:18.551 --> 10:20.886
It's just, [sighs] you know, get out here...

10:21.420 --> 10:23.289
We kick your ass at range and relays,

10:23.422 --> 10:27.326
but every time we're out in the field, we get our asses kicked.

10:28.027 --> 10:30.329
It's all about having the right team.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.431
And that you do.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.806
Mostly.

10:41.974 --> 10:45.177
Listen. I wouldn't beat yourself up over too much.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.580
We just have more experience.

10:47.713 --> 10:49.849
Yeah? And what happens when we're out in the field,

10:49.982 --> 10:51.250
and we run into a team like yours?

10:51.384 --> 10:53.352
That's why we run these scenarios.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.288
You'll beat us some day.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.025
Yeah, that's the plan. [chuckles lightly]

10:59.792 --> 11:01.327
Let's go get a beer, huh?

11:01.460 --> 11:02.995
[upbeat reggae music]

11:09.935 --> 11:11.303
Beer, milady?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.305
No, thanks.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.740
[Sharp] Oh.

11:15.107 --> 11:16.375
Come on, Campbell.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.477
He's just trying to be a gentleman.

11:20.780 --> 11:21.847
Gentleman, huh?

11:22.815 --> 11:25.217
[in British accent] And as one of England's finest gentlemen,

11:25.351 --> 11:27.787
I bring the drinks to court the pretty lady.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.455
You're insufferable.

11:29.922 --> 11:30.856
[Tuck, normal accent] Come on.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.525
I'm not so bad.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.894
Once you get to know me.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.362
I know enough.

11:36.495 --> 11:37.563
Tuck!

11:38.397 --> 11:39.932
Need your help with something inside.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.901
Yeah, yeah, in a minute.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.037
[Miller] Now.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.508
[Tuck, whispering] Don't worry, gorgeous.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.143
I'll be back.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.282
[motorcycle revving]

12:02.621 --> 12:03.522
[engine stops]

12:06.592 --> 12:07.993
[Miller] Man, what the hell are you doing?

12:08.127 --> 12:09.962
-What? -[Miller] Oh, don't play dumb.

12:10.096 --> 12:12.498
I know that you're an idiot, but you're not stupid.

12:13.866 --> 12:14.800
Campbell?

12:14.934 --> 12:16.736
Oh, come on.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.704
[chuckles] How can I not?

12:18.838 --> 12:20.239
She's funny. She's beautiful.

12:20.372 --> 12:21.841
-She's... -[Charlie] Lethal.

12:23.008 --> 12:25.745
Think about it. A tough woman like that.

12:26.178 --> 12:27.813
What happens if you two get in a fight?

12:28.247 --> 12:30.082
She might literally kill you.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.284
[whispers] Totally worth it.

12:32.885 --> 12:36.355
It's never a good idea to dip your pen in the company's ink there, bud.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.324
But look at that ink.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.793
It's everything I've ever wanted for my pen.

12:42.461 --> 12:44.497
-[sighs] Came out wrong. Hold on. -[Miller] Stop.

12:44.630 --> 12:45.431
Hold on.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.066
She's, uh...

12:47.666 --> 12:50.269
She's like Mary Jane to my Peter Parker.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.972
Oh, come on.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.507
-I know you know those names. -[Miller] Tuck!

12:54.640 --> 12:55.808
Uh-huh. Back me up, Charlie.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.610
Even he knows who Peter Parker is.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.545
This isn't a video game, man.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.749
Peter Parker is a comic book character.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.918
[Miller] Stop talking.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.121
You and I both know it's not good to have

13:09.255 --> 13:10.890
somebody close to you in the field.

13:11.557 --> 13:12.725
Look...

13:13.225 --> 13:16.195
-Jason, if this is about Campbell, replac-- -It's not.

13:16.662 --> 13:18.831
I just don't want you making an emotional-based decision

13:18.964 --> 13:20.833
when we're under fire.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.841
-Everything okay in here? -[in British accent] Right as rain, sir.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.544
[in normal accent] Miller here was just telling me how much he loves me.

13:31.677 --> 13:32.845
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

13:33.412 --> 13:34.513
[hoarsely] Do it.

13:35.581 --> 13:36.849
[door opens]

13:38.851 --> 13:40.019
Gentlemen.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.721
You guys mind if I borrow Cross?

13:42.855 --> 13:45.257
Sure thing. I was just about to kick Miller's ass

13:45.391 --> 13:47.126
in a game of beer pong anyway.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.061
Mm, yeah. Money on it?

13:49.995 --> 13:51.530
-Oh, it's on. -Let's go.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.142
You've got a great team there, kid.

14:03.275 --> 14:04.944
We did learn from the best.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.246
Well, not all of you.

14:07.713 --> 14:08.647
What does that mean?

14:08.781 --> 14:10.249
You remember Morocco, right?

14:10.382 --> 14:12.351
[chuckles] Yeah. Oh, man.

14:12.484 --> 14:13.986
Tuck almost blew the whole operation

14:14.119 --> 14:15.955
when that snake slithered up onto his arm.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.556
Case in point. [chuckles]

14:24.530 --> 14:25.598
You all right?

14:27.166 --> 14:28.601
You got a family, Cross?

14:29.768 --> 14:32.838
Does the phrase, "keep that shit to yourself" sound familiar?

14:33.405 --> 14:35.341
Something like, "There's no room

14:35.474 --> 14:38.277
for conversations like that in this business, Cross."

14:39.345 --> 14:40.246
Aah.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.014
What do I know, right?

14:42.681 --> 14:43.616
Why bring it up?

14:46.051 --> 14:47.519
I got a brother.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.155
Ryan. Hell of a guy.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.491
Went in the private security business.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.095
He recently died.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.330
Left behind a wife,

14:58.998 --> 15:00.099
a daughter.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.167
My niece.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.804
Zak, I'm so sorry.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.407
When something like that hits you, it's...

15:09.008 --> 15:10.142
It's sudden.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.913
Makes you realize what an asshole you had been,

15:14.480 --> 15:16.949
because you were too busy to see them.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.255
You don't realize what you got until it's gone, though, right?

15:24.456 --> 15:25.991
Why are you telling me this?

15:26.892 --> 15:28.527
I got no one else.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.702
I have a son.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.807
-Wife? -[chuckles] Ex.

15:42.141 --> 15:45.311
She couldn't really handle the life of being married to a mercenary.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.513
So she split.

15:48.147 --> 15:49.848
Took our son with her.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.283
You still get to see him?

15:52.017 --> 15:53.519
Not as much as I'd like.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.691
Word of advice.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.126
Don't get caught up in all this shit.

16:01.527 --> 16:04.296
But one day, you're gonna be where I'm at.

16:04.830 --> 16:08.600
Or worse, you'll be the one underground.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.436
Well, if I'm lucky,

16:11.003 --> 16:13.639
I may not have to worry about that for much longer.

16:14.673 --> 16:15.908
What do you mean?

16:16.375 --> 16:18.644
I've made some solid investments over the last few years.

16:19.111 --> 16:20.412
If those keep panning out

16:20.546 --> 16:22.181
along with a couple more high-paying contracts,

16:22.314 --> 16:24.216
I might get to retire early.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.152
And then I can just focus on being with my son.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.455
Does your team know you're looking to get out?

16:29.588 --> 16:32.191
I've been waiting for the right time to tell them.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.362
[sighs heavily] I'm also waiting for a couple more of those

16:36.495 --> 16:38.564
high-paying contracts that I mentioned.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.269
Well...

16:45.771 --> 16:46.739
You're in luck.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.742
That enough pay?

16:49.875 --> 16:53.145
-[chuckles] Oh, my God. You son of a bitch! -Uh.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.948
I thought the team might like that.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.717
-What's the objective? -[cellphone vibrates]

16:58.851 --> 16:59.785
Oh.

17:00.953 --> 17:01.954
Afternoon.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.255
Good afternoon, Mr. Morrow.

17:03.389 --> 17:04.656
-This is Dr. Truman. -Hey, Doc,

17:04.790 --> 17:07.359
could you, uh, hold on for just a moment?

17:08.060 --> 17:10.496
Hey, I'm gonna take this.

17:10.629 --> 17:12.231
Give everybody copies of the paperwork,

17:12.364 --> 17:14.333
and set up a briefing for 0800 hours.

17:14.466 --> 17:17.636
We'll go over the details then, and then we'll head out.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.505
[softly] Thank you.

17:22.074 --> 17:22.975
Go ahead.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.944
The procedure is ready. We have the green light

17:26.078 --> 17:28.280
to proceed with everything as scheduled.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.416
I'll be there.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.551
[birds chirping]

17:37.089 --> 17:38.857
[serene music]

17:42.895 --> 17:43.996
[sniffs]

17:44.129 --> 17:45.664
[sobbing]

17:58.510 --> 18:00.579
Can't do this without you.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.388
[Sirona continues to weep]

18:18.564 --> 18:20.099
[Morrow] All right. Hey! Hey!

18:20.232 --> 18:21.500
Focus up.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.702
We don't have much time, so I'll make this brief.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.439
The target we have been assigned is a woman.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.709
Mid 20s to early 30s, going by the name of Sirona.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.045
Unfortunately, a photo could not be provided,

18:33.178 --> 18:35.981
so we'll have to go off the description listed in her file.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.818
Sirona is reported to have broken into an off-the-books black site facility

18:39.952 --> 18:43.122
known as Valkyrie, where she stole valuable information,

18:43.255 --> 18:46.492
and the prototype to a biochemical weapon.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.761
Now Valkyrie has contracted and tasked us

18:49.895 --> 18:52.731
to find said weapon as quickly as possible.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.266
What about the thief?

18:54.399 --> 18:56.068
We'll teach her a lesson

18:56.201 --> 18:58.070
and what happens when you steal.

18:58.203 --> 18:59.605
No, no.

19:00.105 --> 19:03.642
Do not kill the target unless absolutely necessary.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.277
She may be our only lead to the weapon.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.879
Without her, we may never find it.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.349
It's eight to one odds, Dickson. If you're worried about having to kill her,

19:10.482 --> 19:12.451
maybe you shouldn't come.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.521
What sort of bio weapon are we talking about here?

19:15.654 --> 19:17.456
Should we be wearing some sort of protection?

19:17.589 --> 19:19.791
Don't make this complicated, Campbell.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.460
If you're worried about some bioweapon,

19:21.593 --> 19:23.295
maybe you should just leave this up to the men.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.232
If you come across the girl or the weapon, call me.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.667
I don't want anybody to risk themselves

19:28.800 --> 19:30.702
to an unnecessary hazardous exposure.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.405
There is no way one person pulled this off on their own.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.207
No, my thoughts exactly.

19:35.941 --> 19:38.810
Her trajectory has her headed towards some cabins in the area.

19:38.944 --> 19:42.514
It's possible she may have a contact in one of those cabins.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.249
So what's the plan?

19:44.917 --> 19:47.386
Well, the report states that Sirona fled into the Rocky Mountains

19:47.519 --> 19:49.388
1600 hours, two days ago.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.590
The first cabin on records is about 100 klicks west

19:51.723 --> 19:53.158
from where she was last spotted.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.261
The plan is to have Campbell, Tuck, Miller, and I

19:56.395 --> 19:58.330
be dropped off at her last-known location,

19:58.463 --> 20:00.432
try and pick up a trail. Meanwhile,

20:00.566 --> 20:02.000
Morrow, Holt, Sharp, and Dickson

20:02.134 --> 20:04.770
will take a vehicle west to the furthest cabin on record,

20:04.903 --> 20:05.971
work their way down.

20:06.104 --> 20:07.940
The idea is to have both teams converge,

20:08.073 --> 20:09.074
try and smoke her out.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.310
Any other questions?

20:11.877 --> 20:12.711
No? Good.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.847
Grab your gear, 'cause wheels up in ten, ladies.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.456
[serene music]

20:40.672 --> 20:42.808
[serene music continues]

21:11.336 --> 21:12.971
[soft piano music]

21:19.511 --> 21:21.079
[breathing heavily]

21:50.609 --> 21:52.778
[soothing piano music continues]

22:19.504 --> 22:21.707
[somber music]

22:26.111 --> 22:28.180
They were definitely trying to kill something.

22:28.714 --> 22:31.616
Yeah. They definitely made a mess.

22:32.451 --> 22:33.885
All of this for one girl?

22:35.954 --> 22:38.357
There's a side to this Valkyrie's keeping from Morrow.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.125
What are you thinking?

22:41.293 --> 22:42.561
I don't know yet.

22:43.662 --> 22:44.830
This Valkyrie?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.166
Looks like it.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.104
What, are they training storm troopers?

22:54.239 --> 22:56.007
What? Star Wars.

22:56.908 --> 22:59.144
You know how storm troopers can't hit anything?

23:00.846 --> 23:02.948
Tuck, why don't you go see if you can assist Campbell?

23:03.081 --> 23:04.316
[scoffs]

23:04.449 --> 23:05.884
[softly] Like you had to ask.

23:08.987 --> 23:10.555
He needs to lay off the movies.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.925
You know, you'd go crazy out here if he wasn't here to annoy you.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.128
I still prefer him to Campbell.

23:16.995 --> 23:18.497
Still hung up on that, huh?

23:18.930 --> 23:21.166
She's been taken out of multiple scrimmages.

23:22.134 --> 23:26.138
Our unit can't function if she's still making rookie mistakes.

23:26.638 --> 23:27.806
It's just a training exercise.

23:27.939 --> 23:29.541
And this is the real world.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.943
There's no room for that shit out here.

23:33.178 --> 23:34.212
You've seen her record.

23:34.946 --> 23:36.982
It doesn't compare to what we could have had.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.184
You mean what we did have?

23:39.651 --> 23:42.154
All I'm saying is, had you let me pick the replacement,

23:42.821 --> 23:45.590
we wouldn't still be out here waiting for the next clue to follow.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.526
[Campbell] I got something.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.495
Oh, that's just bad timing.

23:51.296 --> 23:52.464
Sure it was.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.500
[Miller sighs]

23:59.104 --> 24:00.071
Got a trail.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.940
Headin' that direction.

24:03.308 --> 24:04.142
You think it's her?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.877
I believe so.

24:06.378 --> 24:07.813
All right, let's head out.

24:08.413 --> 24:09.648
But everyone stay sharp.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.017
Something about this doesn't feel right.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.220
[somber tone]

24:18.690 --> 24:20.091
[man 4, echoes] The results...

24:22.594 --> 24:23.695
[echoes] Her cells show...

24:23.829 --> 24:25.163
[medical equipment beeping]

24:26.131 --> 24:27.332
[echoes] She's becoming dangerous.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.900
[breathing apparatus sounding]

24:29.034 --> 24:31.136
[echoes] She cannot be allowed to live.

24:31.269 --> 24:34.039
-Truman... -[Damien] I love you.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.509
[echoes] I love you too.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.745
[clattering]

24:56.294 --> 24:58.196
Woah! It's okay.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.031
I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.033
My name is Calvin.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.936
You're the man from the picture?

25:05.070 --> 25:06.204
The picture?

25:09.808 --> 25:10.976
That's right.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.713
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:15.714 --> 25:17.916
I see you helped yourself to some bread.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.286
It's all right. You look like you could have used

25:21.419 --> 25:22.821
some food and rest.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.190
How about a real meal?

25:25.323 --> 25:26.791
You still hungry?

25:28.994 --> 25:30.095
Good.

25:31.796 --> 25:33.198
[serene piano music]

25:45.544 --> 25:46.811
What's your name?

25:48.079 --> 25:49.281
Sirona.

25:49.748 --> 25:50.916
Sirona?

25:51.683 --> 25:52.918
That's a pretty name.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.453
Well, Sirona,

25:56.021 --> 25:58.023
there a reason you haven't touched your food?

25:58.790 --> 26:00.292
I'm not sure what it is.

26:00.825 --> 26:02.961
It's bacon and eggs.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.729
What is it?

26:05.130 --> 26:06.364
Just try it.

26:14.439 --> 26:15.840
What do you usually eat?

26:16.608 --> 26:19.578
Dr. Truman always gave us some sort of drink with

26:20.011 --> 26:21.479
bread and chicken.

26:21.613 --> 26:23.081
The drink wasn't very good though.

26:23.214 --> 26:24.316
"Us"?

26:25.517 --> 26:26.885
Me and my brother.

26:27.519 --> 26:28.987
Where is your brother now?

26:29.721 --> 26:30.956
He's gone.

26:33.658 --> 26:35.226
He died trying to protect me.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.731
I'm so sorry.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.783
This is my daughter, Elizabeth.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.661
She's beautiful.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.064
Where is she?

27:13.832 --> 27:15.333
She's gone, too.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.269
What happened?

27:19.771 --> 27:21.439
Lost her to cancer.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.247
Maybe I could have helped her.

27:29.681 --> 27:31.149
I appreciate that.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.019
But there's really not a cure for it.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.389
But I know how to make things better.

27:37.922 --> 27:38.757
How so?

27:38.890 --> 27:40.792
I can show you.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.428
[somber tone swelling]

27:44.963 --> 27:45.830
-[slashes] -[yelling] What are you doing?

27:45.964 --> 27:47.365
No, it's okay.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.900
[clattering]

27:52.170 --> 27:53.705
I need you to let go.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.740
[mystical tone]

28:04.749 --> 28:06.184
Is there more bacon?

28:12.924 --> 28:14.092
Hold on a sec.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.728
What is it?

28:17.829 --> 28:19.397
Something's off with the tracks.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.504
[clicks tongue] Looks like she fell.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.074
[inhales, exhales loudly]

28:31.342 --> 28:32.977
You got something to say, Miller?

28:33.111 --> 28:34.612
Who cares that she fell?

28:35.113 --> 28:36.047
We wanna know where she went.

28:36.181 --> 28:37.782
What do you think I'm doing?

28:37.916 --> 28:39.284
Wasting time.

28:40.018 --> 28:42.887
Look, don't condescend me, asshole.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.256
I don't know what your problem with me is,

28:45.390 --> 28:48.259
but if you think you can do better, be my guest.

28:50.695 --> 28:51.629
No?

28:51.763 --> 28:53.031
Yeah.

28:53.164 --> 28:55.300
Then shut up and let me do my job.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.135
Trail leads this way.

28:59.170 --> 29:01.306
[sing-songy] You got in trouble.

29:01.439 --> 29:02.474
Tuck.

29:04.843 --> 29:05.944
[softly] Okay.

29:08.780 --> 29:09.814
Dude,

29:10.215 --> 29:11.816
you got to ease up on her, man.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.285
-I know Mike was like a brother to you. -No.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.553
He was my brother.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.489
And she'll never replace him.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.993
But he did set the bar, and it's for her to clear it.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.262
I think she's cleared the bar, he set.

29:24.696 --> 29:26.364
It's your bar she can't seem to.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.468
If you could try to start seeing her for who she is,

29:30.602 --> 29:31.870
not who you want her to be,

29:32.003 --> 29:34.205
our team will be a force to be reckoned with.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.441
Aren't we already?

29:37.809 --> 29:40.945
Come on. Let's catch up before Tuck does something stupid.

29:41.079 --> 29:42.814
Tuck is the definition of stupid.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.249
So you can imagine my surprise

29:44.382 --> 29:45.850
when he said he was a coke dealer.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.285
The weird thing is, I've never even seen him

29:47.418 --> 29:48.987
drink a bottle of this stuff.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.257
Yeah, he wasn't talking about the soda, Tuck.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.594
[softly] You're such an idiot.

29:56.728 --> 29:57.996
[Campbell chuckles lightly]

29:59.497 --> 30:00.465
Yeah, uh,

30:00.899 --> 30:02.333
sorry about that back there.

30:02.767 --> 30:06.004
That's all right. Sometimes Jason just needs a swift kick in the ass.

30:06.437 --> 30:09.073
I just don't understand what his problem is. [sighs]

30:12.644 --> 30:15.647
-You know why you were hired, right? -What do you mean?

30:16.080 --> 30:19.083
I mean, did Cross tell you why we needed someone else for the team?

30:19.951 --> 30:22.086
He mentioned that my predecessor

30:22.220 --> 30:24.989
was a casualty from the previous contract.

30:25.723 --> 30:26.991
Anything else?

30:27.892 --> 30:28.827
No.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.596
I'm assuming you've noticed the remembrance bracelet

30:31.729 --> 30:32.964
that Jason wears.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.434
His name is Mike.

30:37.902 --> 30:39.170
So what happened?

30:41.339 --> 30:42.974
I really think Cross should be the one to--

30:43.107 --> 30:45.176
Tuck. Please.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.415
About a year ago, we were contracted

30:50.548 --> 30:52.350
to protect a government official.

30:52.917 --> 30:57.388
Morrow and his crew were busy with another contract, so it was just us.

30:58.857 --> 31:03.194
About four hours into the night, Mike intercepted the threat.

31:04.229 --> 31:06.431
And by the time Jason got there,

31:07.565 --> 31:09.400
found him bleeding out on the ground.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.905
Jason held him as he died.

31:16.774 --> 31:18.343
Jason and Mike, they were...

31:19.244 --> 31:20.511
They were like brothers,

31:20.879 --> 31:23.281
you know, inseparable.

31:24.682 --> 31:27.552
Jason's just not quite been the same since.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.527
This was Mike's.

31:37.695 --> 31:41.366
-I like to hang on to this just 'cause... -I get it.

31:44.802 --> 31:45.703
Hey.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.439
It's not your fault

31:48.573 --> 31:50.541
-or Jason's. -What's the hold up?

31:51.476 --> 31:53.711
I'm just taking a breather.

31:54.512 --> 31:55.480
Okay.

31:58.483 --> 31:59.751
You've still got a good trail?

31:59.884 --> 32:00.852
Uh, yeah.

32:01.319 --> 32:02.420
Leads this way.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.963
[gentle music]

32:24.809 --> 32:25.677
What?

32:26.277 --> 32:29.213
There's nothing left, not even a scratch.

32:29.347 --> 32:32.016
I told you I can cure things with my hands.

32:32.850 --> 32:33.885
But how?

32:34.919 --> 32:37.588
I don't know. It's just something I've always been able to do.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.725
You mentioned a Dr. Truman.

32:40.858 --> 32:41.893
Yep.

32:42.026 --> 32:43.594
Dr. Truman took care of us.

32:44.028 --> 32:47.165
This Dr. Truman, did she perform experiments on you?

32:48.833 --> 32:49.934
How do I say this?

32:50.068 --> 32:52.036
Did she do exercises or tests?

32:52.170 --> 32:55.773
-Tests. -Can you tell me what she did during these tests?

32:58.309 --> 33:00.044
They would take me into a room,

33:00.878 --> 33:03.081
and sometimes, the room had people in it,

33:03.214 --> 33:04.882
and sometimes, it had animals.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.684
[screeching]

33:08.786 --> 33:13.191
Dr. Truman would tell me to touch them to make them better.

33:14.225 --> 33:15.827
She said I was curing them.

33:16.194 --> 33:17.495
And I was.

33:19.163 --> 33:21.165
At least, most of them.

33:21.599 --> 33:22.500
What do you mean?

33:23.101 --> 33:26.170
Well, sometimes, animals and people

33:26.838 --> 33:27.772
would be dead.

33:29.907 --> 33:31.776
And I would try to make them better, but...

33:32.243 --> 33:33.745
...no matter how long I touched them,

33:33.878 --> 33:35.113
nothing worked.

33:35.747 --> 33:39.283
Did Dr. Truman tell you where these people came from?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.285
My brother.

33:41.419 --> 33:43.855
Your brother killed these people?

33:44.689 --> 33:48.793
They would make him touch the people and animals until they became weak or died.

33:48.926 --> 33:51.462
I could always see where he touched them.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.498
He would leave a mark.

33:57.502 --> 33:59.270
The guards would hurt him,

34:00.338 --> 34:02.407
and see if I could make him better.

34:02.840 --> 34:03.775
But...

34:06.377 --> 34:07.545
No matter how bad they hurt him,

34:07.678 --> 34:09.547
there was nothing I could do to help.

34:09.981 --> 34:11.649
Did they ever hurt you?

34:12.683 --> 34:13.751
Sometimes.

34:14.352 --> 34:19.090
Sometimes, they would run tests to see if Damien could hurt me.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.159
But he couldn't.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.129
Dr. Truman said that we were immune to each other.

34:25.997 --> 34:27.198
Where were you?

34:27.732 --> 34:28.633
Valkyrie.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.201
Valkyrie?

34:30.334 --> 34:31.636
The Valkyries decide

34:31.769 --> 34:34.038
who lives and who dies on the battlefield.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.740
Where did you hear that?

34:36.374 --> 34:38.209
It was written on the walls in our rooms.

34:38.776 --> 34:41.446
We were told that we were soon to become Valkyries,

34:41.579 --> 34:45.316
and that we decide who lives and who dies.

34:51.856 --> 34:54.459
I don't want to decide who lives and who dies.

34:54.892 --> 34:57.295
Do you wanna know who the Valkyries really are?

34:58.196 --> 34:59.597
They were these noble beings

34:59.997 --> 35:02.967
who guided the fallen warriors to a better place.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.536
I may not have known your brother,

35:05.670 --> 35:07.205
but he wouldn't have wanted you to be

35:07.338 --> 35:08.973
a victim the rest of your life.

35:09.874 --> 35:12.376
But your brother gave you a fighting chance.

35:12.810 --> 35:15.646
So the next time the Valkyries show their face,

35:16.881 --> 35:19.217
you look them in the eye, and let them know

35:19.350 --> 35:21.385
you're not gonna be a victim anymore.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.654
What if they don't listen?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.022
Then you fight.

35:25.156 --> 35:26.891
[gentle emotional music]

35:34.999 --> 35:38.069
-What are you doing? -I have to head into town for a bit.

35:38.436 --> 35:39.770
Get us some more food.

35:41.272 --> 35:42.473
Can I come?

35:42.607 --> 35:44.342
I think it'll be safer if you stay here.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.777
Okay.

35:46.911 --> 35:48.846
Do you know what a hair dryer is?

35:49.447 --> 35:51.682
It's the thing that blows warm air, right?

35:52.416 --> 35:53.784
So you know what a hair dryer is,

35:53.918 --> 35:56.220
but didn't know what eggs and bacon were?

35:56.354 --> 35:58.489
My nurse at Valkyrie had one.

35:58.623 --> 36:01.526
Well, if you don't wanna walk around with wet hair,

36:01.993 --> 36:05.796
Elizabeth kept a hairbrush and hair dryer underneath the sink.

36:06.597 --> 36:07.832
And what's a sink?

36:09.800 --> 36:10.902
I'm kidding.

36:13.704 --> 36:14.972
I should be back in about an hour.

36:15.106 --> 36:18.309
Stay inside until I get back, all right?

36:19.310 --> 36:20.478
All right.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.481
[vehicle engine ignitions]

36:34.325 --> 36:35.259
Hey.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.662
I think I found where the trail leads.

36:41.432 --> 36:42.700
Think anyone's home?

36:45.469 --> 36:47.038
[clicks tongue] I can't tell.

36:47.572 --> 36:50.474
All right. Campbell, you're on overwatch.

36:50.608 --> 36:53.611
Miller, you take point. Tuck and I will follow.

36:53.744 --> 36:57.982
Remember, if we find Sirona, capture, don't kill.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.984
Our priority is the bioweapon.

37:00.618 --> 37:01.953
All right, everyone, move out.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.822
[fast-paced music]

37:23.140 --> 37:25.309
[fast-paced music dynamizes]

37:47.832 --> 37:49.834
[dryer whirring]

38:17.061 --> 38:18.929
Don't move, don't move, don't move!

38:21.165 --> 38:22.667
Stop moving!

38:25.069 --> 38:26.470
Tuck.

38:28.272 --> 38:30.241
-No. -[Miller] Stop moving or we will shoot you!

38:30.374 --> 38:32.109
[Sirona, shuddering] Please.

38:35.513 --> 38:38.482
Calvin! Calvin, please help me!

38:40.051 --> 38:41.285
Tuck, you stay with her.

38:41.419 --> 38:43.321
Miller and I are gonna clear the rest of the house.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.324
Campbell, we've detained a suspect matching the description.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.059
Got eyes on anything?

38:48.759 --> 38:50.094
Everything looks clear for right now.

38:50.227 --> 38:51.562
But I'll keep you posted.

38:51.996 --> 38:52.930
Copy that.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.043
Tuck, did she say anything?

39:08.446 --> 39:09.380
Miller,

39:10.014 --> 39:12.383
get with Campbell, check the perimeter.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.452
You sure?

39:14.585 --> 39:15.686
Yeah.

39:16.220 --> 39:17.588
Tuck and I got this.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.133
It's okay.

39:29.266 --> 39:30.067
Not gonna hurt you.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.102
What are you--

39:33.270 --> 39:34.572
My name's Allen.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.140
What's yours?

39:39.076 --> 39:40.111
Is your name Sirona?

39:42.246 --> 39:43.948
Cross!

39:48.853 --> 39:49.954
What?

39:50.087 --> 39:51.422
What are you doing?

39:51.555 --> 39:53.958
She's not gonna give us any intel if she's freaked out.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.560
Tuck, look at her.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.931
She look like a threat to you?

40:05.336 --> 40:07.304
Dude, this is the job.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.707
You've got to take emotion out of it.

40:11.509 --> 40:12.643
Yeah.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.745
But you're gonna draw the line somewhere.

40:15.312 --> 40:16.480
I'm gonna call Morrow.

40:16.614 --> 40:18.149
You stay with her.

40:26.791 --> 40:28.125
You finished your perimeter check?

40:28.259 --> 40:29.827
-All clear. -Good.

40:30.327 --> 40:33.030
Dickson and Sharp are inside, finishing up the cabin.

40:33.164 --> 40:34.064
After that,

40:34.832 --> 40:36.600
we have the next one about

40:37.134 --> 40:38.302
20 klicks east.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.004
[cellphone vibrates]

40:43.607 --> 40:46.544
Cross, how goes the eastern sweep?

40:47.077 --> 40:49.246
We found a girl matching the description.

40:49.380 --> 40:50.581
[Morrow] Is she detained?

40:51.048 --> 40:52.616
She's younger than what you described.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.185
It might not be her.

40:57.054 --> 40:59.190
Look, we've been given bad intel before.

40:59.323 --> 41:00.958
Age doesn't concern me.

41:01.091 --> 41:01.992
Is it her?

41:03.327 --> 41:04.228
Cross?

41:05.463 --> 41:08.132
[Cross] [sighs] She responded when I said the name Sirona.

41:08.766 --> 41:11.168
Excellent. Keep her detained.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.336
Zak.

41:13.337 --> 41:15.906
Is there something else about this contract that I should know?

41:18.609 --> 41:19.543
We'll be there soon.

41:19.677 --> 41:21.045
[disconnected tone]

41:25.649 --> 41:27.718
What is taking those idiots so long?

41:29.587 --> 41:30.855
What's the holdup?

41:38.229 --> 41:39.163
What's going on here?

41:42.299 --> 41:43.200
Tell him.

41:46.103 --> 41:46.937
Well?

41:47.938 --> 41:51.642
One of 'em managed to send out an emergency SOS with her cell phone.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.611
[scoffs]

41:55.145 --> 41:57.581
Local authorities are probably on their way.

42:17.935 --> 42:19.670
-[gunshots] -[thud]

42:22.139 --> 42:23.774
[somber tone]

42:27.878 --> 42:29.813
Make it look like a murder-suicide.

42:32.983 --> 42:36.120
And anyone else we encounter, do the same thing.

42:36.253 --> 42:37.655
No loose ends.

42:39.657 --> 42:40.991
Just make it quick.

42:50.868 --> 42:52.303
Perimeter is secure.

42:53.304 --> 42:54.772
Finally.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.540
Can I please go to the bathroom now?

42:56.674 --> 42:58.409
I never stopped you from going.

42:58.542 --> 42:59.710
Yeah, you did.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.246
Said it with your eyes.

43:04.048 --> 43:05.316
Keep an eye on him.

43:06.584 --> 43:07.985
He's being weird.

43:09.119 --> 43:12.356
Now, if you need me, I'll be in the loo.

43:15.492 --> 43:16.527
What's he talking about?

43:16.961 --> 43:18.395
Oh, looks like Cross's famous bleeding heart

43:18.529 --> 43:19.997
continues to pour.

43:20.965 --> 43:22.066
And that means?

43:22.733 --> 43:23.867
Oh, you don't know?

43:24.234 --> 43:25.669
Our fearless leader here tends to have

43:25.803 --> 43:27.504
a soft spot when it comes to morality.

43:27.938 --> 43:28.973
She's just a kid, Jason.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.874
No, she's a paycheck.

43:31.008 --> 43:32.276
And if memory serves, you don't get paid

43:32.409 --> 43:34.144
until she tells us where the weapon is.

43:36.313 --> 43:37.181
She won't talk.

43:37.314 --> 43:38.282
Oh, I can fix that.

43:38.415 --> 43:39.717
Miller.

43:39.850 --> 43:41.885
What? It's not like I'm gonna waterboard her.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.955
We're not gonna get anywhere just sitting around and waiting.

43:45.089 --> 43:47.758
I'm gonna ask you the same thing I asked Tuck.

43:49.693 --> 43:50.928
She look like a threat?

43:53.230 --> 43:55.633
You know as well as I do, threats come in all shapes and sizes.

43:55.766 --> 43:59.036
That doesn't give us the right to hurt anyone we think is guilty.

43:59.169 --> 44:00.738
[Miller, muffled] We're getting paid to do a job.

44:00.871 --> 44:02.473
We don't do the job, we don't get paid.

44:02.606 --> 44:04.575
[Cross] Yeah? And what if she's innocent?

44:04.708 --> 44:06.176
And the argument for right versus wrong

44:06.310 --> 44:08.512
-rages on. -[Cross] You don't know that!

44:08.646 --> 44:11.448
-[Miller] I do know that. -[Cross] Look at her. Look at what she...[indistinct]

44:11.582 --> 44:12.850
Nice digs, though.

44:12.983 --> 44:14.985
[muffled argument continues]

44:18.789 --> 44:20.557
Get your hands up.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.827
[Cross and Miller continue arguing]

44:26.196 --> 44:29.433
[Cross] I'm not going to risk the life of a potentially innocent child!

44:29.566 --> 44:31.335
[Miller] If you're gonna cave every time a little girl gives

44:31.468 --> 44:33.203
you puppy dog eyes, then you're in the wrong business!

44:33.337 --> 44:35.973
Well, lucky for you that won't be a problem anymore.

44:37.041 --> 44:38.409
What does that mean?

44:40.144 --> 44:41.045
Well?

44:43.247 --> 44:44.181
Oh, shit.

44:51.121 --> 44:53.190
Everybody just stay where you are.

44:53.624 --> 44:55.826
If anyone moves, he dies.

44:57.628 --> 44:59.196
Drop your weapons!

45:01.565 --> 45:02.866
Now!

45:15.245 --> 45:16.246
Miller.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.049
Dammit, Tuck!

45:20.818 --> 45:22.319
Everybody step back.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.455
Not you.

45:24.588 --> 45:25.489
Release her.

45:39.436 --> 45:40.270
[Calvin] Sirona.

45:40.404 --> 45:41.772
You okay?

45:42.906 --> 45:45.909
Good. I'm gonna need you to come to me.

45:55.986 --> 45:56.854
-[metal swishes] -[grunts]

45:56.987 --> 45:58.522
-No! -[gunshot]

45:58.655 --> 46:00.124
[Sirona] No!

46:01.825 --> 46:03.227
Let her go!

46:03.761 --> 46:04.928
Sirona!

46:05.062 --> 46:06.497
[crickets chirping]

46:09.433 --> 46:10.834
[door opens]

46:11.935 --> 46:13.036
[door closes]

46:17.274 --> 46:18.542
So you must be Calvin?

46:20.511 --> 46:21.945
Got a last name?

46:22.379 --> 46:24.181
That's none of your business.

46:26.850 --> 46:30.420
It becomes our business when you're found harboring aiding terrorists.

46:30.988 --> 46:32.990
She's just a damn kid.

46:34.558 --> 46:35.826
That sounds familiar.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.795
How can you live with yourselves

46:37.928 --> 46:40.330
torturing a poor, innocent kid like that?

46:40.464 --> 46:42.432
From where we stand, she's guilty.

46:43.567 --> 46:45.302
And I'm beginning to think you're in on it.

46:45.435 --> 46:47.538
What the hell are you talking about?

46:47.671 --> 46:49.306
Where's the bioweapon?

46:49.439 --> 46:50.207
The what?

46:50.340 --> 46:52.376
The bioweapon that Sirona stole.

46:52.509 --> 46:53.410
Where is it?

46:56.079 --> 46:57.414
Think this is funny?

46:58.549 --> 47:00.651
Think your arrogance is pretty damn funny

47:00.784 --> 47:04.454
blindly following orders without questioning what the real facts are.

47:07.424 --> 47:10.561
Let me tell you something. One soldier to another.

47:10.994 --> 47:12.763
You've been lied to.

47:13.530 --> 47:15.566
Whatever it is you've been told about her,

47:16.099 --> 47:17.067
it's a lie.

47:17.501 --> 47:20.437
You're on the wrong side of this.

47:21.138 --> 47:23.073
You know that, don't you?

47:23.707 --> 47:25.108
[eerie music]

47:31.615 --> 47:32.749
[snaps fingers] Hey.

47:32.883 --> 47:34.084
Anyone home?

47:34.218 --> 47:36.787
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

47:37.154 --> 47:39.122
I need to hit the bathroom, you okay?

47:39.256 --> 47:40.457
[Tuck] Mm-hm.

47:44.995 --> 47:46.196
[faint metallic thud]

47:55.105 --> 47:56.473
[Tuck] Damien.

47:57.474 --> 47:58.642
Who's Damien?

48:14.291 --> 48:15.993
I lost someone close to me.

48:17.327 --> 48:19.162
I keep this with me so that...

48:20.030 --> 48:21.331
...I never forget him.

48:24.234 --> 48:26.103
Is that why you keep this?

48:26.770 --> 48:28.005
To remember Damien?

48:40.684 --> 48:43.220
Do you know why we wear it around our necks?

48:45.489 --> 48:47.591
So that we can keep them close to our heart.

48:50.127 --> 48:51.261
Hey, Tuck.

48:52.062 --> 48:53.363
Cross and Miller are going at it again.

48:53.497 --> 48:55.532
Can you see if you can calm them down?

48:58.802 --> 49:01.972
Look, I know it sounds crazy, but what if we are getting played?

49:03.707 --> 49:06.176
-What're you guys talking about? -[Miller] Boy Scout wants to trust a man

49:06.310 --> 49:08.211
that just put a gun to the back of your head.

49:09.112 --> 49:11.982
Jason, when I talked to Morrow, something seemed off.

49:12.115 --> 49:16.086
-So? -So, either Calvin knows more about Sirona than Morrow does,

49:16.219 --> 49:18.088
or Morrow's keeping something from us.

49:18.221 --> 49:19.756
Of course, Calvin knows more about Sirona.

49:19.890 --> 49:21.124
They're working together.

49:21.258 --> 49:23.393
Do you really think that a retired vet

49:23.527 --> 49:25.495
turned domestic terrorist, and helped a young girl

49:25.629 --> 49:28.498
steal a biological weapon from a black site facility?

49:29.032 --> 49:31.068
Do you really think a military black site facility

49:31.201 --> 49:33.036
is doing human experiments?

49:33.170 --> 49:35.138
Because that's what he thinks!

49:35.872 --> 49:36.773
I mean...

49:37.607 --> 49:39.676
...it doesn't sound that far-fetched.

49:39.810 --> 49:41.078
[softly] Goddammit, Tuck.

49:41.611 --> 49:43.914
If you compare this to one of your stupid movies...

49:44.047 --> 49:45.415
No.

49:45.549 --> 49:46.450
I mean...

49:47.985 --> 49:49.252
No. Uh...

49:50.454 --> 49:52.322
I think you guys should see something.

49:57.127 --> 49:58.562
Hey.

49:58.695 --> 50:00.764
I need to borrow Damien's tags for a moment, okay?

50:04.234 --> 50:05.669
[unzips bag]

50:06.436 --> 50:08.038
I'll keep him safe

50:08.171 --> 50:10.640
if you keep Mike safe. Deal?

50:13.210 --> 50:14.344
Okay.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.064
Campbell.

50:41.271 --> 50:42.873
Coincidence?

50:43.440 --> 50:46.843
Damien. Experiment number 029.

50:47.978 --> 50:48.845
Who's Damien?

50:49.346 --> 50:50.414
Who knows?

50:50.547 --> 50:51.181
Friend,

50:51.314 --> 50:53.016
parent, sibling.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.152
But most importantly...

50:55.619 --> 50:57.821
If Damien was an experiment, then...

50:58.355 --> 51:00.190
Doesn't prove anything.

51:01.925 --> 51:04.361
It's at least enough to ask some questions.

51:05.695 --> 51:07.931
I want to talk to Morrow before he sees Sirona.

51:08.732 --> 51:12.436
Campbell, post up outside, radio in when they arrive.

51:17.908 --> 51:18.875
Tuck.

51:19.543 --> 51:21.178
Keep Sirona safe and secure.

51:21.711 --> 51:23.513
At least until we get some answers.

51:23.647 --> 51:25.715
But don't put her with Calvin.

51:26.550 --> 51:27.551
Not yet.

51:28.318 --> 51:29.486
You got it.

51:33.790 --> 51:34.891
[unlatches]

51:43.633 --> 51:45.035
You're gonna look real stupid

51:45.168 --> 51:46.770
when you start questioning Morrow.

51:50.006 --> 51:51.575
We deserve an explanation.

51:52.375 --> 51:54.544
And I don't know what to believe about all this.

51:56.346 --> 51:57.981
But if Morrow got a bad contract,

51:58.448 --> 51:59.816
I want him to know about it.

51:59.950 --> 52:01.818
[somber music]

52:08.325 --> 52:10.494
Need you to hide out in here for me, okay?

52:22.239 --> 52:23.473
Where's Calvin?

52:24.908 --> 52:25.942
He's, uh...

52:26.977 --> 52:28.378
...he's in the other room.

52:29.045 --> 52:30.247
Is he okay?

52:30.380 --> 52:33.383
Yeah, and we just want the same for you.

52:33.517 --> 52:34.951
We just wanna keep you safe.

52:36.153 --> 52:37.420
[softly] Okay.

52:43.326 --> 52:44.461
Trade you.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.670
Thanks for keeping him safe.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.980
[Cross on transceiver] How's look out there, Campbell?

53:04.114 --> 53:05.048
It's quiet.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.349
Still no signs of movement.

53:06.783 --> 53:08.418
All right. Keep me posted.

53:08.919 --> 53:09.886
Copy that.

53:12.956 --> 53:13.857
[twig snaps]

53:16.960 --> 53:19.896
Are you hiding me because of the bad guys?

53:20.697 --> 53:22.432
Why are you asking me that?

53:23.633 --> 53:25.835
The bad guys killed Damien, and...

53:27.504 --> 53:29.940
I'm scared the same thing's gonna happen to me.

53:32.442 --> 53:34.444
I... [clears throat] I'm gonna do everything

53:34.578 --> 53:36.780
I can to make sure that doesn't happen.

53:49.125 --> 53:50.594
You know what this is?

53:51.428 --> 53:52.629
Good.

53:53.196 --> 53:55.498
I want you to have it.

53:58.068 --> 53:58.969
That way,

53:59.436 --> 54:01.104
if any of the bad guys come after you,

54:01.238 --> 54:02.872
you can defend yourself.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.575
This help me not be a victim?

54:08.445 --> 54:09.546
Uh...

54:11.481 --> 54:12.582
Yeah.

54:17.287 --> 54:18.888
Wanna see some other cool stuff?

54:25.228 --> 54:27.664
What'd you mean by that comment you made earlier?

54:28.465 --> 54:30.000
-Which one? -The one about you not being

54:30.133 --> 54:31.835
a problem for much longer.

54:33.737 --> 54:36.006
I think that's a conversation better had off mission.

54:36.139 --> 54:37.307
Oh, don't give me that.

54:37.774 --> 54:39.843
There isn't jackshit going on right now.

54:42.912 --> 54:44.714
[Campbell on transceiver] Cross, he's here.

54:46.049 --> 54:47.017
Copy that.

54:47.450 --> 54:48.618
We'll be right out.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.389
[dramatic music]

54:59.396 --> 55:01.331
[laughs] Look at that.

55:01.464 --> 55:03.900
Completing a contract in record time.

55:04.034 --> 55:05.935
Yeah, well, it's all about having the right crew, right?

55:06.069 --> 55:08.004
-Yeah. -[Miller] We don't hold up against you guys.

55:08.138 --> 55:10.507
We all know having you on the team is like having a handicap.

55:11.174 --> 55:13.977
All right, out of the two of us, who's got the better record?

55:14.110 --> 55:15.245
Ooh.

55:15.378 --> 55:16.479
Good.

55:16.613 --> 55:17.681
Where are Dickson and Sharp?

55:18.114 --> 55:19.649
Having them doing a perimeter sweep.

55:19.783 --> 55:21.084
They'll be here in a few minutes.

55:21.618 --> 55:23.286
-Where's the girl? -Actually, Zak,

55:23.420 --> 55:25.355
-there's something I wanted to talk to you about. -Cross.

55:26.189 --> 55:27.390
Where's the girl?

55:28.091 --> 55:29.059
Inside.

55:29.192 --> 55:30.660
Perfect. Let's get after it.

55:30.794 --> 55:31.695
Woah.

55:34.964 --> 55:37.801
Look, I think we got a bad contract.

55:40.036 --> 55:42.505
And why, pray tell, would you think that?

55:42.639 --> 55:45.108
We got some intel you might want to hear.

55:46.676 --> 55:48.211
Same mistakes.

55:48.645 --> 55:49.546
Different day.

55:50.213 --> 55:52.015
What the hell are you doing, Sharp?

55:52.449 --> 55:53.650
Just fulfilling a contract.

55:54.150 --> 55:55.151
On me?

55:55.785 --> 55:57.821
[Sharp] Somebody thinks highly of themselves.

55:57.954 --> 55:59.656
Then what the hell do you call this?

55:59.789 --> 56:00.990
[Sharp] Insurance.

56:01.124 --> 56:02.258
For what?

56:02.859 --> 56:05.095
Morrow got a little worried after his last call with Cross.

56:05.228 --> 56:08.064
Thought that he might do something drastic.

56:08.665 --> 56:10.033
We're just making sure we get paid.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.635
And you have to point a gun at me to do that?

56:13.103 --> 56:13.870
No.

56:14.804 --> 56:18.041
I was just thinking how nice the pay would be with one less share.

56:20.844 --> 56:23.847
Oh. That's a pretty cute story you got there.

56:24.314 --> 56:26.649
There's just too many coincidences, the contract said--

56:26.783 --> 56:29.919
The contract said hunt down Sirona,

56:30.053 --> 56:33.723
and that is exactly what you did.

56:34.758 --> 56:37.827
No. The contract said to return a weapon.

56:37.961 --> 56:40.063
A bioweapon that we still don't have.

56:40.196 --> 56:41.598
Yes, you do.

56:44.234 --> 56:45.201
What?

56:45.335 --> 56:46.302
Sirona.

56:46.836 --> 56:48.037
She's the bioweapon.

56:48.171 --> 56:50.140
What the hell are you talking about?

56:50.573 --> 56:51.674
It's complicated.

56:51.808 --> 56:53.943
Short version is that girl in there

56:54.077 --> 56:57.080
is a ticking time bomb, and she needs to be put down.

56:57.213 --> 56:58.648
Whoa, I don't understand.

56:58.782 --> 57:00.450
I don't expect you to understand.

57:00.583 --> 57:01.751
What I expect

57:01.885 --> 57:05.388
is for you to do what we were hired to do.

57:05.522 --> 57:07.123
We were hired to return the weapon.

57:07.257 --> 57:10.293
So if what you're saying is true, we need to return her.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.663
It said, "return her," it didn't say "alive."

57:14.464 --> 57:15.999
Jesus Zak, she's just a kid.

57:16.132 --> 57:17.133
She's a monster!

57:18.435 --> 57:23.006
She is responsible for the deaths of multiple soldiers,

57:23.139 --> 57:24.207
including Ryan.

57:24.707 --> 57:26.976
You didn't think that was something that we needed to know?

57:27.410 --> 57:28.845
Woah, who's Ryan?

57:32.148 --> 57:33.183
Morrow's brother.

57:36.286 --> 57:39.355
All you do is pull the ring and throw it.

57:40.356 --> 57:43.293
-Can I try-- -No! [blows raspberries faintly] [chuckles] No.

57:43.426 --> 57:45.395
No-ho-ho-ho.

57:45.528 --> 57:46.896
Not in here. Mm-mm.

57:47.263 --> 57:50.266
See, when you, when you throw it, it creates an explosion.

57:50.400 --> 57:51.534
Explosion?

57:52.836 --> 57:54.604
Explosion is a...

57:55.205 --> 57:56.873
It's a, it's a big boom.

57:58.274 --> 57:59.209
Oh.

58:04.547 --> 58:05.648
You okay?

58:06.683 --> 58:08.585
I've just got a bad feeling.

58:11.254 --> 58:12.922
Can I please see Calvin?

58:13.323 --> 58:14.724
[Tuck sighs heavily]

58:17.694 --> 58:18.795
Okay.

58:19.629 --> 58:21.030
I'll go check on him.

58:21.164 --> 58:22.098
But if I do,

58:22.599 --> 58:25.134
you've to promise to stay in here. Got it?

58:26.269 --> 58:27.237
Okay.

58:31.307 --> 58:32.242
[door opens]

58:32.976 --> 58:34.744
Why would you keep something like that from us?

58:34.878 --> 58:37.547
Oh, don't get so high and mighty, Miller.

58:37.680 --> 58:40.884
It's like you always say, "It's just another paycheck, right?"

58:43.520 --> 58:44.687
This is the job.

58:44.821 --> 58:47.524
Personal or not, she has to die.

58:48.024 --> 58:50.326
And I'll take anyone down who stands in our way.

58:54.264 --> 58:55.331
Problem?

58:57.867 --> 58:59.269
What the hell are you doing?

59:00.103 --> 59:00.737
[gun cocks]

59:00.870 --> 59:02.338
[dramatic music]

59:06.843 --> 59:07.944
[Sirona] Calvin?

59:09.712 --> 59:11.281
-Calvin! -Sirona, no!

59:11.414 --> 59:12.782
Let me go! I can help him.

59:12.916 --> 59:15.184
There's nothing you can do for him!

59:18.388 --> 59:19.289
Wait!

59:21.524 --> 59:22.825
Morrow.

59:23.393 --> 59:24.627
I'm sorry, Cross.

59:24.761 --> 59:26.462
I can't let you stand in our way.

59:26.863 --> 59:28.231
Last chance.

59:28.364 --> 59:29.866
Take us to the girl.

59:33.303 --> 59:35.638
Looks like things are escalating down there.

59:37.907 --> 59:39.776
Better hope Cross makes the right choice.

59:42.679 --> 59:44.047
[dramatic music swells]

59:45.815 --> 59:46.983
[music ceases]

59:49.385 --> 59:50.286
What's going on?

59:50.420 --> 59:51.888
Stay back, Tuck!

59:55.291 --> 59:56.292
Screw it.

59:58.595 --> 59:59.495
That's my cue.

59:59.629 --> 01:00:00.830
[dramatic music]

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:04.634
[grunts]

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:09.372
[growls]

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:20.650
Looks like there will be one less share.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.421
Prick.

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:30.326
[gunshot]

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.707
[both straining]

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.177
[cracking]

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:56.719
Hide...

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.091
Get up!

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:13.336
How are you doing this?

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:16.472
You can thank Valkyrie.

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.307
-[grunts] -[gun cocks]

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:19.809
Drop him, Morrow!

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.148
[grunts]

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:28.351
Stand down.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:34.057
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.192
Shut up and get on your knees.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.463
You two have one more chance to get on board or die.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.305
[Campbell on transceiver] Get him to take a few steps forward.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.208
What's it gonna be, Cross?

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:02.285
Do your worst.

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:05.988
[gunshot]

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:08.024
[gunshot]

01:02:10.793 --> 01:02:12.028
Nice shooting, Campbell.

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:29.879
[birds chirping]

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:37.987
[Tuck inhales deeply]

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:39.322
Hey.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.290
How you feeling?

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:47.063
Would I have shot if I said I had died and gone to heaven?

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:50.366
And he's back.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.035
How are you doing?

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:58.441
Oh. What happened?

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.544
Wait.

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:03.479
Was I shot?

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.584
What was that?

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.420
How much do you remember?

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.024
I remember...

01:03:15.992 --> 01:03:17.260
...Morrow.

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.228
Where is he?

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.298
-I had to, uh-- -Dead.

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:25.902
Along with the rest of the assholes.

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:32.341
Wait a minute. I was shot!

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:34.477
Where's the bullet wound?

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.879
How come I don't feel any pain?

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:42.618
You know how...

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:46.255
You know how you're like into comic books and shit?

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:52.361
[chuckles]

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.096
No way.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:57.166
[high-pitched] Did I?

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:00.236
Mm.

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:02.104
[inspirational music builds]

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:05.408
-Yeah, you don't-- -[inspirational music ceases]

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.009
[chuckles] You don't have superpowers.

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.044
[imitates faint explosion]

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:11.981
[commanding voice] Then how do you explain my bullet wound, citizen?

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:13.916
Well...

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.652
Somebody has superpowers in this cabin.

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:18.487
It ain't you.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.991
What?

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.467
Tuck's awake.

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:32.702
Is he okay?

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:35.171
Yeah. I heard him when I was coming down the hall.

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.374
Definitely blew his mind.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.376
Made him fangirl.

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:42.278
Made him what?

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.847
Uh, he's just really happy

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:46.215
about what you did for him.

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:50.319
I'm glad he's okay.

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:54.023
He wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, so,

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:56.125
thank you.

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:01.130
He really seemed to care for you.

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.300
He was a good person.

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:07.970
So why isn't he better?

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.374
I was able to heal his wounds, but...

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:14.310
...if someone's already dead...

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.150
I'm so sorry about all this.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.286
I wanna make it up to you.

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:25.288
Bring you somewhere safe.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.524
I don't have anywhere to go.

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:39.235
Hey.

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:41.103
We'll figure it out, all right?

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:52.748
Hey.

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:55.284
Thanks for...

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.653
Well, you know.

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:08.030
[Tuck] Are you absolutely sure it wasn't me?

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:11.233
You know, I kind of want you to find out.

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.438
Tuck, shoot yourself,

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.273
I'm not gonna let Sirona heal you.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:19.976
Fine.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.546
So, we just got hit with a whirlwind of bullshit.

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:26.515
We all have way more questions than answers.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:29.151
But right now, we need to formulate a plan to get out of here

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:30.519
before Valkyrie comes looking.

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:33.723
I guess that all depends on what we decide to do with the girl.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.391
We're gonna help her.

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.093
And how exactly do we plan on doing that?

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:39.261
First, we're gonna get her out of the woods,

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:40.963
get her someplace secure.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.366
We'll have to work on a long-term plan later.

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:46.002
Shouldn't we at least consider what Morrow said?

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:49.338
I mean, is she a ticking time bomb?

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:50.706
He said that?

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:52.375
[Miller] He tried to kill us.

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:54.610
His word means nothing.

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.445
Speaking of which...

01:06:57.713 --> 01:07:00.349
How was he able to toss you around like that last night?

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:01.951
I don't know.

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:04.353
But he said we can thank Valkyrie for that.

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:08.424
So both he and Sirona are linked to Valkyrie?

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.693
And they both had special abilities.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:13.329
Yeah. We need to talk to Sirona.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.965
And see what she has to say.

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:17.767
She's in a bad spot right now.

01:07:18.267 --> 01:07:19.335
I'm not sure questioning her is gonna be

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:20.736
the best thing at the moment.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.605
We can start with something simple, like,

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:24.073
"Who's Damien?"

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.308
[Sirona] He is my brother.

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.479
I heard you guys talking about Valkyrie.

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:34.350
I'm sorry. We don't need to talk about this right now.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:36.685
It's okay.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.188
I wanna help.

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:41.157
All right, then.

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:43.359
What can you tell us?

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.668
Well, that was a lot to take in.

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:55.337
Yeah, I mean,

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.506
human experiments?

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.507
Kids?

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:00.409
-Who does that? -Yeah.

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:01.811
That's really messed up, man.

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:04.113
You doing all right?

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.748
For the most part.

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:09.819
We both know what I'm about to ask you.

01:08:12.888 --> 01:08:14.323
I'm not gonna drop it.

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.292
Not until you tell me.

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:18.661
I'm looking to get out of the game.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:20.563
Why?

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.165
My son.

01:08:24.333 --> 01:08:25.668
I'm slowly saving up enough money,

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.870
so that I can retire, and just be with him.

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:33.409
How close to the goal are you?

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:36.812
Well, this contract would more than set me up, but...

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:41.617
Well, it sucks that you're leaving, but...

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:43.352
I am happy for you.

01:08:46.655 --> 01:08:47.890
But do you know what kills me?

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:49.859
You're leaving me with Tuck.

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.361
Surprised you didn't say Campbell.

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:57.933
Mm.

01:08:58.067 --> 01:08:59.368
Yeah, she cleared the bar.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.571
Glad to hear it.

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:18.287
Everything's ready to go.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.688
You pick a route yet?

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.858
Well, we could take the main road out of here,

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.561
but if anyone's coming this way, we run the risk of being caught.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.730
I also thought about backtracking the way that Sirona came,

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:30.833
but if anyone tracks her the way we did...

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:35.304
Really, our best option is to head directly east into the wilderness.

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:39.408
It'll be rough, but it's the only way.

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.918
[cracking]

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:50.953
[somber tone swelling]

01:09:51.086 --> 01:09:52.555
[Tuck screams]

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.829
Tuck. What happened?

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.431
[mutters lightly]

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:04.433
Who's that?

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:10.706
Where is Morrow?

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.575
His face just... Everything just...

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:14.910
Wh-- Slow, slow down. What happened, Tuck?

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:16.946
His face changed, Cross!

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:19.248
Tuck, what the hell are you talking about?

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:22.885
His face did that!

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.288
Are you saying...

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:29.725
...he transformed into this guy?

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:32.494
Uh-huh.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.230
All right, everyone, calm down.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.066
-Could you be seeing things? -No!

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:39.134
-Why would I-- -Cody.

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:40.703
What was that?

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.808
That's Cody.

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:48.410
Do you know him, Sirona?

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:50.913
Cody used to scare us.

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:54.650
He would change into Dr. Truman and then change back.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.785
He thought it was funny.

01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.255
Hey, nerd.

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.658
What, uh, what would you call that superpower?

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.193
Shape shifting. [exhales]

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.928
Come on, man.

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:07.896
I thought you'd be way more excited about this.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.932
I mean, this is the shit that you're always watching. You know,

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:12.134
it's in those movies, those comic books you're always readin'.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.903
All right. First of all, if that was Rebecca Romijn or Jennifer Lawrence,

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:16.839
I'd be freaking out for a whole different reason, man.

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:18.107
Second of all,

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:19.942
this is real life.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.011
It ain't natural.

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:25.581
All right, guys, I don't like this.

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:27.549
Let's get moving.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:29.685
Everybody roll out.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.721
Sirona.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.359
We need to go.

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:53.008
[sinister tone]

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:05.087
I know that look.

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:06.755
What's wrong?

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:10.726
It's just Zak.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.930
I mean, do you think he sent that guy deliberately, or...

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:16.799
...is he in trouble?

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:19.101
Man, that guy was with us for a while,

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:20.936
and he couldn't even tell the difference.

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:24.606
That tells me Morrow's either working with him or Valkyrie.

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.576
I wouldn't get too spun up about it.

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:33.115
I think we're probably missing the bigger issue here.

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:37.486
We probably just killed the world's greatest actor.

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:40.589
[laughs] I mean, think of the work that guy could have done.

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:42.057
[exclaims]

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.626
You know what else I was thinking?

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.528
If you could go back in time,

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.331
and talk to your younger selves about this mission,

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:50.666
what would you say?

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:54.770
Oh, I don't know. Probably tell Cross not to hire a man named Tuck.

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:56.305
You know,

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:58.907
we don't have to hear his bullshit all the time.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:03.045
[man 5 and woman scream]

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:08.283
What was that?

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:10.452
Sounded like it came from up ahead.

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:14.123
All right, everyone keep your eyes peeled,

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.724
move slowly and quietly.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:18.127
Sirona, stay close.

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.928
[suspenseful music]

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:39.882
Cross.

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:36.271
Damien?

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:37.272
[man 6] Close.

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:38.540
[Sirona screams]

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.481
Surprised?

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.816
[Tuck exclaims softly] Yes and no.

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.785
You had a hell of an understudy.

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:51.854
Uh-uh.

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:54.089
First things first.

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:55.958
Drop 'em.

01:14:57.559 --> 01:14:59.595
You don't wanna listen? Fine.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.442
Now back away,

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:17.045
get on your knees, and put your hands on your head.

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:22.117
You're not playing the odds, Cross.

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:23.585
[cocks gun]

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:47.075
You four have been a pain in my ass on this job.

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:52.948
The task

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.883
[chuckles] couldn't have been more simple!

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:58.487
Yeah, well, sometimes, we like to work harder, not smarter, so...

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.757
Keep talking, Tuck, and I'll cut your tongue out.

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.192
Is it true?

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:06.962
She killed your brother?

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:09.665
In a way. If her and her brother

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:11.567
hadn't pulled that little escape stunt,

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.669
Ryan would still be alive.

01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:16.171
I'm sorry, Zak, but she didn't kill Ryan.

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:17.639
Oh, spare me.

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:20.642
I'm sure my replacement told you all about what she is.

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.411
We've seen what she can do.

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:24.913
Then you know she has to die.

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:26.315
She can heal people.

01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:28.250
How is that a death sentence?

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:30.452
She's gonna evolve.

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:31.620
Evolve into what?

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:33.155
I don't really care.

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:35.624
All I know is that she has to die.

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:37.225
Think of all the good she could do.

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.194
What if you're robbing the world of the cure for cancer?

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:41.630
You're not getting the big picture,

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.231
it's what she's gonna do

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:44.833
that concerns Valkyrie.

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:46.401
Then we take it up with them.

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:47.736
You don't have to kill her.

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:49.237
-She's just a kid. -I can see

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:50.739
we're not gonna see eye to eye on this!

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.040
-[gunshot] -[all scream]

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:59.982
One step and the same thing happens to you.

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:01.316
She's an innocent girl.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.684
Miller, you're a soldier.

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:05.320
You're meant to be seen and not heard.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.022
You're all killers.

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:09.825
Stop pretending to be something you're not.

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:13.128
That's how you get caught up in situations like this.

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:17.132
But sadly,

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:19.368
you can't help yourself.

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:21.136
Can you?

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.105
[scoffs]

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:27.709
It's too bad it had to end this way.

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:33.048
I really did think of you as family, Cross.

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:35.784
-[metal swishes] -[grunts in pain]

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:37.953
[growls in pain]

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.355
[mystical tone]

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.427
[groans]

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:54.269
[gun firing continues]

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:57.706
Where's Cross?

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:01.610
[Morrow exclaims]

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:02.544
[Morrow grunts]

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.780
[dramatic music]

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:10.919
[Morrow grunts]

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:19.695
How many times do I need to say it?

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:22.464
She needs to die!

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:25.901
Think of your son, Allen.

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:27.302
I am.

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:29.237
If I let you kill her,

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.406
I'd never be able to look him in the eye.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.407
[disgusted exclaim]

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.609
So self-righteous.

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:36.244
Yeah.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:37.279
Well,

01:18:37.779 --> 01:18:39.448
got to draw the line somewhere.

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:43.452
[Morrow laughs]

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:44.986
My turn!

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.192
[strains] What the hell was that?

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:03.472
I'm open to suggestions.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.547
[Tuck] Heads up!

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:16.952
Might need this too.

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:20.956
Flank 'em.

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.268
[Morrow grunts]

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:35.137
[growls]

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.111
What did you do to yourself?

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.447
That's a funny story.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.415
[Dr. Truman] The procedure is ready.

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:48.917
We have the green light to proceed

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.619
with everything as scheduled.

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:51.753
I'll be there.

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:53.455
Are you sure you're up for this?

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:55.924
We haven't attempted to transfer abilities before.

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:58.693
I have a tendency to bounce back pretty quickly.

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:00.529
Send your shape shifter, Doc.

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:03.465
Once I'm done with him, no one will know the difference,

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:06.301
and you'll have Sirona back within days.

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:07.836
Turns out

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.871
Cody didn't really like Sirona,

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:11.106
so it didn't take much convincing

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:12.641
to get him to try to kill her.

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:15.110
Fortunately for me, he failed.

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:17.879
And now, that pleasure's mine.

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:19.147
[grunts]

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:24.419
[laughs wickedly]

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:28.690
[laughs]

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:30.525
Who would have thunk, huh?

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:33.728
Eight mercenaries caught up in all of this?

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:36.364
You're the reason we're caught up in this.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:40.535
Valkyrie is opening Pandora's box.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.337
None of this is natural!

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:44.639
Well, I guess that makes you a hypocrite then.

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:48.176
Sometimes, you've got to fight fire with fire.

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:50.212
And when I'm done with that little monster,

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.214
I'm taking down that freak factory.

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.683
She's not the monster here, Morrow.

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:56.017
You are!

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:58.954
[grunts]

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.641
[gunshot]

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:25.146
I told you not to get caught up in this shit, Cross.

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.250
Because one day...

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.320
...you'll be the one underground.

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:10.125
[gun fires]

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.071
[Tuck groans]

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:39.254
That's right.

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:47.095
[Tuck] Is that all of them?

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:52.434
[gunshot]

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:01.676
That's five.

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:06.514
I'm gonna marry that woman.

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:09.751
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:12.654
[mocks]

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:16.691
It's nothing personal, Cross.

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.760
It's for the greater good.

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:22.130
[straining] Morrow, stop.

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:31.139
You have eluded your fate too long, little girl.

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:33.274
[dramatic music increases]

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.232
[mystical tone]

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.742
Where'd you get the grenade?

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.179
I took it from Cody's belt.

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:15.050
Wasn't it supposed to cause a big boom?

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:16.551
Different kind of grenade.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:17.919
[exhales]

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:20.889
Morrow says he has your brother's abilities.

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:22.357
What are we looking at?

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:24.692
If he touches you for too long,

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:26.061
you'll die.

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:27.862
And he gets stronger.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.465
He's a parasite.

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:33.301
How do we stop him?

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:35.470
Me.

01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:39.674

[Cross whines]

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:57.425
[growls] I was gonna make your death quick and painless.

01:24:58.059 --> 01:25:00.628
[yelling] But you just had to piss me off!

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:04.732
In a way, this is better,

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.636
'cause I want you to feel what Ryan felt when he died.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.373
[whispering] I want you to feel his fear.

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:16.811

[faint rumbling]

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:21.149
What?

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:24.018
-[Morrow grunts] -[Sirona chuckles] You...

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:26.454
You can't hurt me. [coughs]

01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:30.525
Didn't Dr. Truman tell you?

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:32.160

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:01.956
I won't be a victim anymore.

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:29.250
All better?

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:31.419
Yeah.

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:32.820
Thanks, Sirona.

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:44.666
[in British accent] And by the power of the Lord, I command thee to walk.

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:49.204
Oh! Oh, come on.

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:52.273
You can't expect me to ignore a low-hanging fruit like that.

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:09.591
You good?

01:27:15.196 --> 01:27:16.531
They were our mentors.

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:19.601
Our friends.

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:21.369
Now they're wolf food.

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:23.338
You can't change people, Cross.

01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:24.572
So I wouldn't get caught up on it.

01:27:25.506 --> 01:27:28.910
The world could use more people like you and less like them.

01:27:30.144 --> 01:27:31.713
More people like us.

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:37.051
More like her.

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:41.322
Thank you, Sirona.

01:27:50.398 --> 01:27:51.766
Let's go home.

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:55.603
[ethereal music]

01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:47.255
[Cross] So you're the one behind all this mess.

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:48.556
[somber music]

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.458
Good to finally put a face to a name,

01:28:50.925 --> 01:28:52.026
Dr. Truman.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.495
Allen Cross.

01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:58.166
And Jason Miller.

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.401
I was wondering when this day would come.

01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:02.837
You may not be too happy that it's here.

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:06.941
Oh, come now, Mr. Miller, we can be civilized about this.

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:12.347
Do I make you nervous, Mr. Miller?

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.315
Can't be too careful.

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:16.417
I've seen the shit you've created.

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.555
I haven't given myself any abilities,

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:22.857
if that's what you're concerned about.

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:28.029
Please.

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:37.038
-Surprised you knew our names. -How could I not?

01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:40.541
Your little group stole an asset very valuable to me.

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:42.343
We didn't steal anything.

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:44.679
Damien set Sirona free.

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:46.647
We just finished the job.

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.417
Let's not get technical, Mr. Cross.

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:51.953
The point is she's property of Valkyrie.

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:53.488
She's nobody's property.

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:54.689
She's a human being.

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:57.024
A very dangerous human being.

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.427
She helps people.

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:03.564
Why are you here, Mr. Cross?

01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:06.234
Morrow said something about Sirona being a time bomb.

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:08.970
Came to find out what he meant by that.

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:13.674
Sirona's cellular structure is constantly changing.

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:15.276
We've seen it from day one.

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:17.011
She's not like the others.

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:22.216
You didn't think that she, Damien, and Cody were the only ones, did you?

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:28.189
Cross-species genetics has enabled us to discover so many amazing things.

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:32.627
It's opened the door to making humans stronger, faster, able to heal themselves.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.028
The potential is endless.

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:38.399
But Sirona is not like our other subjects.

01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:40.001
We've studied her blood samples,

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:42.970
and the cells are changing into something new,

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:45.606
something that we don't understand.

01:30:46.674 --> 01:30:48.509
Which is why I am concerned

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:51.512
that that change will harm others.

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:53.548
So you hire a bunch of guns to kill her?

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.183
No, that was Morrow's crusade.

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:57.885
He should not have kept that information from us.

01:30:58.019 --> 01:30:59.520
[Miller] You think we believe you?

01:30:59.654 --> 01:31:01.355
I personally fought your Valkyrie guards.

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:04.125
[Dr. Truman] And Morrow bought them off just like he did Cody.

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:07.929
You actually did me a favor by disposing of them.

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:09.964
What's gonna happen to Sirona?

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:10.865
I'm not sure.

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:13.367
Which is why you need to give her back to us

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:15.736
for her safety and yours.

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:17.572
She told us about what happened to her

01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:19.173
while she was under your care.

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:24.278
Personally, I think her odds are better with us.

01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:29.383
If Sirona drastically changes, she could be responsible for thousands of deaths.

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:31.552
Then you don't know her at all.

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:39.060
If you continue to hide her from us,

01:31:39.193 --> 01:31:42.196
my superiors have ordered me to place a hit on you.

01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:45.132
And we'll be ready.

01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:51.839
[Miller] We need to take her out, Cross.

01:31:51.973 --> 01:31:54.342
That's how we finish this, okay?

01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:55.910
Living under these aliases and in these rental homes

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:58.379
just isn't my idea of security.

01:31:58.513 --> 01:31:59.780
I get that.

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:01.716
But killing Truman won't end the threat.

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:04.719
You heard her, she answers to someone else.

01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:07.722
And if what she said about Sirona is true,

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:10.224
we're gonna need her before this is all over.

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:13.694
I mean, I, I get that we did the right thing.

01:32:14.328 --> 01:32:16.631
I just don't wanna live my life looking over my shoulder.

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:19.734
So if Truman's off the table, we know what we have to do.

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:22.537
-[door closes] -[Tuck] No away. No...

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.305
He's totally the next bad guy.

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:26.641
What? That doesn't even make any sense.

01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:28.042
Were we watching the same movie?

01:32:28.175 --> 01:32:30.177
They couldn't have made it more obvious.

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.212
Sirona?

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:33.447
What do you think?

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:35.283
I'm just trying to figure out

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:38.419
why a guy with no powers dresses like a bat.

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:41.389
Why the other superheroes even let him hang around?

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:42.990
[high-pitched] Oh!

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:45.026
Blasphemy!

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:47.295
Uh-huh. I vote Sirona stay somewhere else.

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:49.463
Staying here is destroying her mind.

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:52.099
-Did you have a good time, Sirona? -[Sirona] Yeah.

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:54.835
I have a little bit of a headache today, though.

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:56.871
Well, she's been getting some headaches,

01:32:57.004 --> 01:32:59.740
but I think it's just too much sodium

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:02.009
from all the bacon you've been eating.

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:03.544
I'm fine.

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:07.248
Look, I can make the headache go away.

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:11.052
[mystical tone]

01:33:15.356 --> 01:33:17.558
See, all better.

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:19.360
That never gets old.

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:21.729
Good thing, Big Pharma doesn't know you exist,

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:23.264
or we'd all be in trouble.

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:25.299
What's Big Pharma?

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.101
Just ignore him.

01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:29.637
Hey, Sirona, how about you run upstairs and get cleaned up?

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.105
We'll get dinner started.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.874
Okay.

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.648
[sighs] She's a good kid.

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:47.254
[Miller] She's still holding up, all right?

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:52.159
She has a lot of questions.

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:57.164
But I think she's doing okay.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.168
She still mourns for her brother.

01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:04.872
I see her holding his tags, like, every day.

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:08.075
But...

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:11.379
[Campbell] But what?

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:16.417
[Cross] But she's not safe here.

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:18.586
[ringing]

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:20.921
[mystical tone]

01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:25.192
What do you mean?

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:28.095
[Cross] We found Dr. Truman.

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:32.333
Her superiors ordered a hit on us.

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:36.370
Valkyrie wants her badly.

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:39.974
They think she's gonna change into something.

01:34:40.474 --> 01:34:41.542
Into what?

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:45.146
[suspenseful, ethereal tone]

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:50.818
What do you suggest?

01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:53.521
I've been talking it over with Jason.

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:55.556
And if we wanna keep her safe,

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:57.658
there's really only one thing we can do.

01:34:58.059 --> 01:35:00.327
[dramatic ethereal tone]

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.034
We take the fight to Valkyrie.

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:08.869
[dramatic music swells]

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:11.372
[music ceases]

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:13.007
[Sirona] What's happening?

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:15.509
[dramatic music]

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:16.096
[music concludes]

01:37:16.964 --> 01:37:18.365
[birds chirping]

01:37:21.702 --> 01:37:23.204
[mystical tone]

01:37:26.273 --> 01:37:28.008
[suspenseful tone]

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:37.551
[gentle music]
