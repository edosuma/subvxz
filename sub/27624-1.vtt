01:31.055 --> 01:31.924
Oh, hey. Look.

01:32.457 --> 01:34.490
Oh, thank God.

01:34.492 --> 01:36.195
- Hey!
- Hello. Good morning.

01:39.665 --> 01:42.198
Sorry. We don't
mean to scare you.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.234
You wouldn't happen to know

01:43.236 --> 01:45.004
where the AT picks up
around here. Would you?

01:49.441 --> 01:52.078
Um. Ma'am. Hey.

01:53.712 --> 01:55.546
You through, hikers?

01:55.548 --> 01:58.214
Oh, yes, yes, ma'am.
We've been out here for,

01:58.216 --> 02:01.521
- uh, like eighteen days...
- Eighteen or nineteen, yeah.

02:02.921 --> 02:03.987
How's it been?

02:03.989 --> 02:05.755
Oh, it's been good.
It's been real good.

02:05.757 --> 02:07.990
We got lost like three
or four times, I don't know.

02:07.992 --> 02:09.792
Maybe four or five.

02:09.794 --> 02:11.131
Maybe that,
maybe that.

02:17.269 --> 02:18.935
Um...

02:18.937 --> 02:21.738
Well, again,
sorry to walk up on you.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.906
Uh, if you could just point us
in the right direction.

02:23.908 --> 02:24.943
You boys hungry?

02:32.751 --> 02:34.219
You get many hikers this way?

02:35.387 --> 02:37.022
Just the ones
that can't read maps.

02:39.625 --> 02:41.191
So, do you live out here?

02:41.193 --> 02:42.094
I do.

02:42.561 --> 02:43.994
Well, we do.

02:43.996 --> 02:44.963
You and...

02:52.104 --> 02:53.237
My husband.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.370
No. Stop!

02:54.372 --> 02:56.138
You hear me?
I said stop! Right there.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.808
You stop right there.
Did you hear me?

02:57.810 --> 03:00.810
Adam. Adam, I said stop.
Right there, please. Darling.

03:00.812 --> 03:02.613
- Adam, you stop right there.
- Is that a gun?

03:02.615 --> 03:04.850
- Listen to me. No.
- Get down.

03:06.852 --> 03:08.050
How did you
find this place?

03:08.052 --> 03:09.852
- We, no...
- Who told you about us?

03:09.854 --> 03:11.755
- We didn't...
- We just took a wrong turn.

03:11.757 --> 03:13.759
- We're looking for the trail.
- Adam, please, darling.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.659
- Get up.
- Okay.

03:15.661 --> 03:17.163
Walk. Get up!

03:17.962 --> 03:19.064
Okay, okay.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.465
- Adam, listen to me.
- Move.

03:22.467 --> 03:24.804
- Okay. Okay.
- Get 'em off.

03:25.304 --> 03:26.306
Get 'em off!

03:28.007 --> 03:31.608
- Get in.
- Adam, darling. Please.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.046
Pull them bandanas down.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.503
Hey!

07:20.505 --> 07:22.941
Do you know how
to get to the hiker's lodge?

07:26.245 --> 07:28.577
The lodge
is a few miles down the trail.

07:28.579 --> 07:30.046
Yeah, I know. Got it.

07:30.048 --> 07:32.218
- All right. Be careful.
- Thanks.

10:25.590 --> 10:27.323
Oh, no, don't worry
about it. It was my fault.

10:27.325 --> 10:29.059
I didn't mean to startle you.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.629
No, I... Really, it's okay.

10:32.798 --> 10:33.765
How are you feeling?

10:34.599 --> 10:35.468
I'm...

10:36.600 --> 10:37.503
I'm better.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.603
Ella?

10:41.605 --> 10:42.707
Excuse me.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.548
How does dinner sound?

11:26.650 --> 11:27.852
You must still be weak.

11:29.587 --> 11:30.555
I insist.

11:32.557 --> 11:35.291
- I don't know, I think...
- I could draw you a bath

11:35.293 --> 11:37.129
and you could get
a head start in the morning.

11:46.605 --> 11:47.572
Okay.

12:13.798 --> 12:15.397
I hope the water suits you.

12:15.399 --> 12:17.367
We'll be working
on the other side of the barn.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.305
The whole place is ours, so...

12:21.373 --> 12:22.908
I think you'll
find it quite private.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.530
Shit.

13:43.488 --> 13:45.488
Adam. Adam, darling,

13:45.490 --> 13:47.493
would you like to say grace?

13:54.633 --> 13:56.902
Adam, the grace.

14:05.309 --> 14:08.011
Thank you,
Lord for this food. Amen.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.014
Amen.

14:21.158 --> 14:22.724
I apologize.

14:22.726 --> 14:25.297
- My cooking is not...
- It's okay, um,

14:26.096 --> 14:26.999
I've had worse.

14:37.942 --> 14:39.408
That dress, it fits you.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.511
Oh, thank you. Yeah. It's nice.

14:41.513 --> 14:42.915
- How did you find us?
- Adam.

14:49.019 --> 14:51.421
Well, I was walking in the woods

14:51.423 --> 14:53.993
and I got lost. I was hiking.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.495
Know your way back?

14:58.830 --> 15:01.367
Um, no.

15:02.133 --> 15:03.903
Like I said, I was lost. So...

15:12.409 --> 15:15.648
Be ready tomorrow.
We leave first thing.

15:24.755 --> 15:26.989
I'm gonna let you
eat your meal in peace.

15:26.991 --> 15:27.860
Mm-hmm.

16:02.394 --> 16:03.528
I'm sorry.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.865
We don't get
many visitors these days.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.702
I kind of figured that.

16:16.908 --> 16:20.044
So are you just, like,
off the grid or something?

16:24.048 --> 16:28.120
I mean, you have no power,
no water and...

16:29.553 --> 16:31.389
You're, like, an Amish.

16:33.224 --> 16:35.427
Oh. Oh, no.

16:37.294 --> 16:38.796
Not quite.

16:40.831 --> 16:43.168
But it's just
the two of you out here.

16:45.570 --> 16:48.774
Truth is it's
been nice having company.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.411
I should turn in.

16:55.413 --> 16:57.079
You stay out here
as long as you like.

16:57.081 --> 16:58.714
It's such a pleasant evening.

16:58.716 --> 17:01.019
Just know my husband
will be ready to leave at dawn.

17:16.934 --> 17:17.935
You smiled.

17:23.074 --> 17:23.976
What of it?

17:25.710 --> 17:27.445
Just been a while, is all.

18:22.767 --> 18:25.133
I, uh... I overslept.

18:25.135 --> 18:28.171
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to, I just...

18:28.173 --> 18:29.740
You tryin' to leave?

18:30.775 --> 18:31.910
What?

18:32.442 --> 18:33.945
You tryin' to leave?

18:35.646 --> 18:36.879
Well, you said that, uh...

18:36.881 --> 18:38.984
I know what I said,
now I'm asking you.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.519
You tryin' to leave or not?

18:46.523 --> 18:48.092
You can stay
till week's end.

19:16.487 --> 19:18.056
Ah!

19:21.726 --> 19:24.125
Ah, shit!

19:26.597 --> 19:28.099
Let me see 'em.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.840
You're done for the day.

19:37.842 --> 19:39.674
No, I'm fine. I can still...

19:39.676 --> 19:41.410
I said you're done.

19:41.412 --> 19:44.182
You've earned your keep.
Head on inside.

19:46.017 --> 19:48.754
- I'm fine, really. I mean...
- Get.

20:24.255 --> 20:26.756
Here you are. How's that feel?

20:26.758 --> 20:28.860
It's, uh... It's better.

20:29.227 --> 20:30.262
Thank you.

20:31.796 --> 20:33.362
You going back out there?

20:33.364 --> 20:36.867
Uh, well, no. He said
that I'm done for the day.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.271
He must be takin' to you, then.

20:41.405 --> 20:43.038
I wouldn't say that.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.942
He hasn't run you off
with a shotgun yet.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.980
It means he must have
taken to you.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.419
Hey!

21:38.229 --> 21:39.264
Right here.

21:58.682 --> 22:00.184
You, uh...

22:00.852 --> 22:02.421
What are you makin'?

22:05.522 --> 22:07.623
This corn feed here.

22:07.625 --> 22:10.926
Heated up water,
yeast, add some mash.

22:10.928 --> 22:14.630
Steam runs through this pipe
here into the thumping keg.

22:14.632 --> 22:17.134
Thump, thump.
Mash falls to the bottom.

22:20.304 --> 22:21.306
Got it?

22:22.807 --> 22:24.539
This creek,

22:24.541 --> 22:26.674
secret to the whole damn thing.

22:26.676 --> 22:28.677
Vapor worms its way
through here,

22:28.679 --> 22:30.248
river water cools it down,

22:31.115 --> 22:32.284
until...

22:35.752 --> 22:37.422
Shit'll knock you on your ass.

22:43.428 --> 22:46.331
You're, uh...

22:47.765 --> 22:49.301
You're making moonshine.

22:50.233 --> 22:51.936
Best in Appalachia.

22:55.405 --> 22:57.008
I noticed that.

22:59.109 --> 23:01.278
I reckon we may need some more.

23:02.613 --> 23:04.846
Need to see the tree, anyhow.

23:10.855 --> 23:13.791
Oh, you know, I guess
it makes sense now.

23:14.592 --> 23:15.560
What?

23:16.493 --> 23:18.326
You know, you just...

23:18.328 --> 23:20.398
You have no one
out here to tell you

23:21.332 --> 23:22.898
what to do, or...

23:22.900 --> 23:25.470
You know, you can just
kinda do whatever you want.

23:27.571 --> 23:29.404
Yeah.

23:29.406 --> 23:32.276
I guess it is something,
now you mentioned it, but...

23:33.376 --> 23:34.578
I sometimes forget.

23:37.481 --> 23:38.583
Mmm.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.457
Oh, my God.

23:51.996 --> 23:53.932
So what's your story, then?

23:57.602 --> 23:59.634
What do you mean?

23:59.636 --> 24:01.306
You hiking on your own?

24:02.539 --> 24:03.841
Yeah.

24:04.541 --> 24:06.275
No boyfriend or anything?

24:06.277 --> 24:07.809
Mm-mmm, no.

24:07.811 --> 24:09.480
No, no, nothing like that.

24:12.682 --> 24:14.318
Family?

24:16.453 --> 24:17.588
Not really.

24:20.958 --> 24:22.994
No one's gonna come find you?

24:26.998 --> 24:29.000
I don't really
want them to find me.

24:34.204 --> 24:35.339
Well...

24:37.141 --> 24:38.740
I guess you came
to the right place then.

24:38.742 --> 24:40.144
Yeah.

24:41.311 --> 24:42.313
Yeah.

24:42.646 --> 24:44.014
Oh, my.

24:44.582 --> 24:45.748
You okay?

24:45.750 --> 24:48.517
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just a little sore.

24:48.519 --> 24:51.589
Yeah, well, chopping wood's not
easy if you ain't used to it.

24:52.423 --> 24:54.358
Come here. Here.

24:58.328 --> 24:59.396
Here?

25:00.897 --> 25:02.430
- How's that feel?
- Oh.

25:02.432 --> 25:04.732
It hurts, but it's good.

25:04.734 --> 25:07.369
- Too hard?
- No, no, not at all.

25:09.539 --> 25:11.108
Just close your eyes, Lily.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.962
There you are.

25:33.864 --> 25:36.798
Ooh. Thank you.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.370
That was very wonderful.

26:13.837 --> 26:15.871
Oh, shit. Adam.

26:15.873 --> 26:17.873
Adam, I'm...

26:17.875 --> 26:20.045
Shit, I'm sorry, um...

27:26.676 --> 27:28.145
Well...

32:26.643 --> 32:28.046
Won't you come and sit?

32:43.559 --> 32:44.928
Those two are mine.

32:47.364 --> 32:49.133
The ones with the crosses.

32:50.834 --> 32:53.403
They were stillborn,
the both of them.

32:58.342 --> 33:00.878
We haven't been together,
since all of that.

33:05.615 --> 33:08.118
First, I thought
that is what I had been missing,

33:09.286 --> 33:10.755
but after last night,

33:12.955 --> 33:15.559
all I could think was
there's more to it.

33:17.428 --> 33:18.763
I don't...

33:19.829 --> 33:20.865
More to what?

33:25.568 --> 33:28.437
At first, I didn't know
why you showed up here.

33:28.439 --> 33:30.905
I thought maybe you were a test.

33:30.907 --> 33:32.776
You needed
to show us something,

33:33.410 --> 33:35.443
teach us.

33:35.445 --> 33:37.746
But after last night,
I realized,

33:37.748 --> 33:39.116
you're here for something else.

33:49.259 --> 33:50.691
Hey.

33:50.693 --> 33:53.228
Ella, can't we just wait a sec?

33:53.230 --> 33:54.432
Come on, we're here.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.432
You want me to go in there?

33:58.434 --> 34:00.704
We both are.

34:01.838 --> 34:03.337
Uh...

34:03.339 --> 34:04.975
I don't know
about that.

34:05.741 --> 34:07.441
You wanted answers, right?

34:07.443 --> 34:08.913
I'm trying to give them to you.

34:10.246 --> 34:12.081
Well, this doesn't
make any sense.

34:12.815 --> 34:14.583
You're running away, aren't you?

34:19.523 --> 34:21.492
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

34:22.826 --> 34:24.996
But we both know
you can't run from this.

34:31.735 --> 34:32.937
Where'd you get that?

34:33.768 --> 34:35.137
This ain't gonna fix you.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.637
Did you go through my stuff?

34:36.639 --> 34:37.804
This is not a cure.

34:37.806 --> 34:39.407
What the hell is wrong with you?
How dare you...

34:39.409 --> 34:41.777
Listen to me! I am trying

34:42.210 --> 34:43.945
to help you,

34:43.947 --> 34:45.516
if you will let me.

34:50.286 --> 34:51.788
Take off your bandages.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.028
Go on, take 'em off.

35:10.606 --> 35:12.509
Oh, it's...

35:14.478 --> 35:15.713
You see?

35:18.481 --> 35:20.615
It's what I've been
trying to tell you.

35:20.617 --> 35:22.687
- We gotta get you inside that cave.
- Ella!

35:24.221 --> 35:25.987
No. No!

35:25.989 --> 35:27.722
Adam, calm down.

35:27.724 --> 35:29.657
Listen to me.
Lower that gun, Adam.

35:29.659 --> 35:31.325
Why you bring her here?

35:31.327 --> 35:32.730
Lower that gun, Adam.

35:33.697 --> 35:35.666
Why the hell you bring her here?

35:41.338 --> 35:43.173
Ella, you best start talkin'.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.842
I said, start talkin'.

35:47.844 --> 35:49.012
All right.

35:50.012 --> 35:50.947
All right.

35:56.052 --> 35:58.188
I didn't want you
to hear it like this.

35:59.623 --> 36:01.759
This is not
how it was supposed to go.

36:04.795 --> 36:06.230
But I want out.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.869
I want out.

36:15.271 --> 36:16.641
What do you mean?

36:18.375 --> 36:20.077
I mean, I ain't happy.

36:21.978 --> 36:24.581
I ain't been happy
for a long time, man.

36:26.650 --> 36:28.619
I ain't happy and I want out.

36:30.721 --> 36:31.952
You ain't happy, we'll fix it.

36:31.954 --> 36:35.125
- We can't fix this.
- Why can't we can't?

36:40.630 --> 36:42.065
We did the time.

36:43.599 --> 36:44.969
Adam,

36:46.536 --> 36:48.072
we both did.

36:51.574 --> 36:53.109
But we made vows.

36:55.579 --> 36:58.015
Vows weren't meant for this.

36:59.416 --> 37:00.785
What we're doing,

37:02.418 --> 37:04.989
this ain't natural.
You know that.

37:05.688 --> 37:07.157
What are you talking about?

37:09.326 --> 37:10.525
Vows are forever.

37:10.527 --> 37:12.193
Ain't nothing forever.

37:12.195 --> 37:13.397
How can you say that?

37:16.833 --> 37:19.467
How do you explain this then?
How do you explain all this?

37:19.469 --> 37:21.001
How do you explain her?

37:21.003 --> 37:22.304
She ain't got nothing
to do with it.

37:22.306 --> 37:24.873
She's here for a reason,
Adam, she's a sign.

37:24.875 --> 37:27.508
She was sent here for us,
she was sent here for you.

37:27.510 --> 37:29.110
She got lost
like all the others.

37:29.112 --> 37:31.412
She was sent here
so you could save her.

37:31.414 --> 37:33.918
She was sent here
to be with you.

37:35.418 --> 37:37.020
No, no, no.

37:37.721 --> 37:39.789
No, you are my wife.

37:42.192 --> 37:43.590
You are my wife!

37:43.592 --> 37:45.996
She was sent here
so I could leave.

37:54.070 --> 37:55.338
But you love me.

37:59.675 --> 38:01.077
Say it.

38:04.114 --> 38:05.416
Say you love me.

38:09.385 --> 38:11.119
Say it, God damn it!

38:25.534 --> 38:26.903
I'm sorry.

38:33.409 --> 38:34.478
No.

38:38.447 --> 38:40.016
You watch what you did.

38:41.550 --> 38:42.987
You did that.

38:43.652 --> 38:45.121
You watch what you did.

38:47.590 --> 38:49.289
You watch her.

38:49.291 --> 38:51.261
You watch what you did.

38:52.561 --> 38:54.331
Watch what you did.

39:16.987 --> 39:18.686
Come on.
We gotta turn back.

39:18.688 --> 39:20.291
Well, we both know...

39:25.594 --> 39:26.827
Don't you quit me now.

39:26.829 --> 39:28.630
Get out of here.
You're hurting me.

39:28.632 --> 39:30.465
Just wait until
Shelby's men find us.

39:31.735 --> 39:33.371
I thought we could get away.

39:41.644 --> 39:43.644
Come on. Come on.

39:46.682 --> 39:47.985
Get in.

39:54.190 --> 39:55.358
Take this.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.829
I'll keep watch.

39:59.663 --> 40:01.362
Go on, get.

40:01.364 --> 40:02.932
Go sit yourself down.

41:42.298 --> 41:43.467
Ella.

41:46.802 --> 41:48.071
Wake up.

41:50.039 --> 41:52.942
It's morning.
We should make a run for it.

42:08.592 --> 42:09.593
Oh.

42:14.130 --> 42:17.331
What was I thinking?

42:17.333 --> 42:21.137
Trusting you.
I never should have done it.

42:23.472 --> 42:24.507
And now what?

42:26.476 --> 42:30.979
We missed the damn train.
The truck's shot up.

42:30.981 --> 42:32.847
Even if we do
make it out of here,

42:32.849 --> 42:35.215
Shelby's got eyes
for a hundred miles.

42:35.217 --> 42:37.120
Do you even got the damn money?

42:39.556 --> 42:40.590
Adam?

42:42.626 --> 42:43.727
Adam?

42:47.664 --> 42:48.966
What is this?

42:52.434 --> 42:54.270
Adam? Hey.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.676
Oh, no. Oh, no.

43:00.677 --> 43:02.012
Oh, no.

43:22.798 --> 43:25.335
Hey. Hey! Hey!

43:31.273 --> 43:32.572
Hey!

43:32.574 --> 43:33.576
Help!

43:34.543 --> 43:35.578
Hello?

43:38.614 --> 43:39.682
Hello?

46:45.235 --> 46:46.702
- What's that?
- The deed.

46:47.836 --> 46:49.572
Thomas and Mary Bragg.

46:52.842 --> 46:54.278
It was just hanging up.

46:55.177 --> 46:57.446
No safe, no lock.

46:58.882 --> 47:00.514
What of it?

47:00.516 --> 47:02.219
They ain't coming back.

47:03.887 --> 47:05.355
Like hell, they ain't.

47:08.056 --> 47:09.759
They shot the dog in the shed.

47:13.228 --> 47:14.497
They planned it.

47:16.565 --> 47:17.667
Why?

47:26.309 --> 47:28.345
We're here now
and I have the deed.

47:30.646 --> 47:32.682
Planning on stealing their name?

47:35.885 --> 47:37.254
I could be a Mary.

47:38.054 --> 47:39.623
I guess that makes me Thomas.

47:39.956 --> 47:40.958
No.

47:41.958 --> 47:43.393
No, it's my place.

47:43.760 --> 47:44.925
Not yours.

47:44.927 --> 47:46.563
I gotta claim just as you.

47:48.164 --> 47:49.362
You'd be dead without me.

47:49.364 --> 47:51.831
And you'd still be living
under Daniel Shelby.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.733
That deal is square.

47:53.735 --> 47:56.672
I paid you the money. It's your
own damn fault for losing it.

48:04.079 --> 48:06.280
I'll let you stay for a while
until those wounds are healed.

48:06.282 --> 48:08.285
Then I expect you
to be on your way.

48:14.356 --> 48:15.893
What? What you laughin' at?

48:17.092 --> 48:19.028
You know how to farm, do you?

48:22.465 --> 48:24.968
- It's like your cooking.
- I'll get by.

48:26.235 --> 48:27.471
And money?

48:29.038 --> 48:30.373
I'll get by.

48:38.780 --> 48:41.384
And if your daddy shows up
to take you back,

48:42.318 --> 48:43.720
how are you gettin' by then?

48:47.389 --> 48:48.759
I said I'll get by.

49:00.235 --> 49:01.605
Suit yourself.

49:03.072 --> 49:04.508
Miss Bragg.

50:18.213 --> 50:19.679
Get off me, woman.

50:19.681 --> 50:21.282
You're a damn fool, you know?

50:21.284 --> 50:22.516
- I'm fine.
- You are not fine.

50:22.518 --> 50:24.820
I said quit it,
I don't need your pity.

50:30.659 --> 50:32.892
Now, I know you're torn up
about this place.

50:32.894 --> 50:35.762
Can't take gettin' the one-up
by a woman, can you?

50:35.764 --> 50:37.764
Living under a woman's roof?

50:37.766 --> 50:40.166
But you listen to me
and you listen straight.

50:40.168 --> 50:42.972
If you think this is pity,
you got another thing comin'.

50:43.806 --> 50:45.206
I didn't run
halfway across the state

50:45.208 --> 50:47.744
for you to lead Shelby
and his men right back to me.

50:49.612 --> 50:51.481
I ain't getting caught.

50:53.148 --> 50:54.650
I ain't no snitch.

50:55.851 --> 50:59.188
But you're a right fool.
Dumb as they come.

51:01.923 --> 51:05.525
Now, you can sleep
in the shed for all I care.

51:05.527 --> 51:08.931
But you ain't leaving a trail in
the woods for the hounds to follow.

51:10.166 --> 51:13.233
You try and leave again
before those wounds are closed,

51:13.235 --> 51:14.804
I'll put you
in the ground myself.

51:25.213 --> 51:26.880
Or,

51:26.882 --> 51:30.751
you can hobble your ass back inside
and actually make yourself useful.

51:30.753 --> 51:32.956
Ain't no way I can build
a still by myself.

52:39.554 --> 52:41.322
<i>I'll admit,</i>

52:41.324 --> 52:44.490
<i>I never expected you to take up
your daddy's work.</i>

52:44.492 --> 52:46.193
<i>Stepdaddy.</i>

52:46.195 --> 52:49.900
<i>We need supplies, don't we? We'd
never last the winter without them.</i>

52:56.938 --> 52:59.472
<i>You want to sell hooch
right under his nose?</i>

52:59.474 --> 53:02.141
<i>Of course not.
We'll trade it.</i>

53:02.143 --> 53:05.247
<i>Barter it.
We'll stay low that way.</i>

53:11.052 --> 53:15.025
<i>Shelby hides behind these.
You don't know him like I do.</i>

53:16.057 --> 53:18.228
<i>He ain't never
going to stop looking for me.</i>

53:39.882 --> 53:41.648
<i>That's the best moonshine
for a thousand miles.</i>

53:41.650 --> 53:43.052
<i>I know, that's a fact.</i>

53:44.619 --> 53:45.955
Two bottles.

53:47.155 --> 53:48.291
As in right now.

54:01.670 --> 54:02.871
He didn't find us.

54:03.905 --> 54:06.208
I ain't planning on changing it.

54:12.914 --> 54:14.250
<i>What did he do to you?</i>

54:17.619 --> 54:20.753
I've done all they were saying
and never asked a single question.

54:20.755 --> 54:22.891
And you will never ask me again.

54:33.601 --> 54:35.137
<i>I'll kill
that man for you.</i>

54:36.237 --> 54:37.273
I swear it.

54:54.023 --> 54:56.192
Well, who would've thought?

54:56.726 --> 54:57.958
Not me.

54:57.960 --> 55:01.161
I thought you were
always just a big dumb mule.

55:01.163 --> 55:03.867
I thought you were nothing
but a pair of chicken legs.

55:06.235 --> 55:07.237
Well...

55:09.003 --> 55:12.072
You're still a mule
and a chicken escaping the wolf.

55:14.342 --> 55:15.642
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

55:15.644 --> 55:17.344
- Let me check to make sure you're all right.
- I said I'm fine.

55:17.346 --> 55:19.349
- Let me change those dressings, anyway.
- I'm fine.

55:31.760 --> 55:33.797
You're right.
It's probably fine.

55:34.396 --> 55:35.931
Not like I said.

55:43.472 --> 55:45.041
I should probably turn in.

55:48.643 --> 55:49.912
Mm-hmm.

55:50.679 --> 55:52.014
Good night.

55:54.516 --> 55:55.951
Good night.

58:00.708 --> 58:01.877
Adam!

58:35.710 --> 58:36.578
Hello.

58:38.112 --> 58:40.148
I know someone's in there.

58:43.418 --> 58:46.221
I'm looking for my daughter,
Ella Shelby.

58:48.824 --> 58:50.590
Go on in there.

58:55.396 --> 58:57.000
Ella, you in there?

59:03.405 --> 59:04.470
You go in now.

59:04.472 --> 59:06.308
You go and get
that damn door open.

59:17.318 --> 59:19.389
Boss, she's out back.
I can see her.

59:21.090 --> 59:23.159
You make sure
you don't hurt her now.

59:24.059 --> 59:25.595
She goes unharmed.

59:38.139 --> 59:39.474
Stop right there.

59:41.210 --> 59:42.412
Ella, don't you run.

59:42.978 --> 59:44.047
Don't you run.

59:45.481 --> 59:46.349
Boss!

59:46.914 --> 59:47.914
Boss!

59:47.916 --> 59:49.485
I got her out by the...

59:52.454 --> 59:54.157
- Come on!
- Adam.

01:00:07.436 --> 01:00:09.503
Now, get in. Stay quiet,
I'll be back.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:10.336
You're leaving?

01:00:10.338 --> 01:00:11.673
It's time for you to trust me.

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.115
Ella.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.151
Ella.

01:00:56.851 --> 01:00:58.150
I got the other one.

01:00:58.152 --> 01:00:59.655
Shelby ran off. I ain't see him.

01:01:03.358 --> 01:01:04.394
Come on.

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:29.950
Thank you, my dear God.

01:01:31.686 --> 01:01:33.489
You come one step closer.

01:01:35.123 --> 01:01:38.525
Can't tell you how many times
I prayed for today.

01:01:38.527 --> 01:01:39.729
For this moment.

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:42.398
We all have.

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:44.333
Stay back.

01:01:45.233 --> 01:01:47.032
Just this last weekend,

01:01:47.034 --> 01:01:49.536
Pastor Willett lead
a beautiful sermon.

01:01:49.538 --> 01:01:51.204
There wasn't a dry eye
in the whole chapel,

01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:52.639
not nowhere in the congregation.

01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:54.744
I said stay back.

01:01:58.679 --> 01:02:01.116
Saw that still down there
by the stream.

01:02:02.684 --> 01:02:03.552
You build that?

01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:07.623
I'm a proud man.

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:09.990
I'm a proud father.

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:12.258
You ain't no father of mine!

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.563
Don't you say that.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:16.865
Don't you say those words.

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:19.666
You may not be from my seed,

01:02:19.668 --> 01:02:21.233
but I ain't any
lesser father to you

01:02:21.235 --> 01:02:22.637
than the good Father
above us all.

01:02:24.306 --> 01:02:26.273
Now it is time, sweet Ella,

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:27.843
- for you to return.
- No.

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:32.849
Enough sin has been cast.

01:02:35.317 --> 01:02:37.452
Enough blood has been shed,

01:02:38.253 --> 01:02:40.153
and forgiven in Jesus' name.

01:02:40.155 --> 01:02:41.354
No.

01:02:41.356 --> 01:02:43.155
No,
please just let me go.

01:02:43.157 --> 01:02:45.825
I am here to cleanse you

01:02:45.827 --> 01:02:46.892
in the Holy Spirit.

01:02:46.894 --> 01:02:48.528
Just let me leave, please.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:51.164
To forgive you,
your transgressions.

01:02:51.166 --> 01:02:53.599
- Please, just let me leave.
- You will repent!

01:02:53.601 --> 01:02:56.135
Do you hear me! Let me hear
you say it with your mouth,

01:02:56.137 --> 01:02:57.507
repent...

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:31.574
Hey there, chicken legs.

01:03:34.509 --> 01:03:35.644
Hey, mule.

01:03:38.679 --> 01:03:41.483
You gonna
patch me up again?

01:03:43.284 --> 01:03:45.453
I don't think I can this time.

01:03:50.692 --> 01:03:51.693
I'm sorry.

01:03:53.795 --> 01:03:54.797
Okay.

01:03:57.199 --> 01:03:58.733
You lay still now.

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:04.707
You got any water?

01:04:10.211 --> 01:04:13.315
In the cave.
There's water in the cave.

01:04:56.224 --> 01:04:58.425
Come on, Lily. Drink this.

01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:00.827
Come on. Drink it.

01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:02.731
Drink it. Come on.

01:05:05.934 --> 01:05:10.306
That's it. That's it.
That's it. That's it.

01:05:30.257 --> 01:05:31.593
She's still out.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.382
What are you doing?

01:05:55.684 --> 01:05:57.687
You wanna carry her by yourself?

01:06:02.657 --> 01:06:03.856
Just drop me off with her then

01:06:03.858 --> 01:06:05.961
and I'll figure it out
from there.

01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.878
Adam.

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:29.785
Adam.

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:00.807
- Where is he?
- He's not here.

01:08:00.809 --> 01:08:02.541
- Where is he?
- He's not here. You're safe.

01:08:02.543 --> 01:08:04.110
He's not here. It's just us two.

01:08:04.112 --> 01:08:05.677
- Let me get out of here.
- Lily, you're safe.

01:08:05.679 --> 01:08:07.347
Lily, you're safe. Stay here.
We'll stay the night.

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:09.682
I will leave at the next stop
and you'll never see me again.

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:11.821
You're safe.
You're safe, darling.

01:08:12.454 --> 01:08:14.586
Lily, he's not here.

01:08:14.588 --> 01:08:15.690
He's not here.

01:08:16.756 --> 01:08:18.158
You're safe, darling.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:23.562
He... He shot me.

01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:26.633
He shot me. How am I...

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:32.006
This is what I wanted
to show you at the cave.

01:08:36.344 --> 01:08:37.880
This is how.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:42.984
Okay.

01:09:42.777 --> 01:09:44.645
But it just tastes like water.

01:09:45.345 --> 01:09:46.613
I know.

01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:52.220
I don't understand any of this.

01:10:01.962 --> 01:10:03.064
Am I cured?

01:10:09.003 --> 01:10:10.305
Lily, darling,

01:10:11.506 --> 01:10:13.909
you got so much worse really.

01:10:15.443 --> 01:10:17.376
Maybe if you kept
drinking the water,

01:10:17.378 --> 01:10:19.113
it could stave it off.

01:10:41.536 --> 01:10:44.640
I'm so sorry.

01:13:13.054 --> 01:13:15.958
Hey, you wanna join us?

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:19.060
We got a beer
with your name on it.

01:13:21.162 --> 01:13:22.495
No, thank you.

01:13:22.497 --> 01:13:26.068
Oh, come on, looks like you
could use a little trail magic.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:32.940
Um... Thank you.

01:13:33.608 --> 01:13:35.844
But I'm fine, really.

01:13:38.345 --> 01:13:42.048
She said this was
the end of the road for you.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:44.019
You just gonna
hitch it back into town?

01:13:48.055 --> 01:13:49.955
I'll make you a deal.

01:13:49.957 --> 01:13:52.023
Come on over, have a drink.

01:13:52.025 --> 01:13:53.558
You could stay the night
in the hostel,

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.330
and if you still feel the
same way tomorrow morning,

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:59.334
I'll take you back
into town myself.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.169
Come on.

01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:05.339
Okay.

01:14:05.606 --> 01:14:06.942
Yep.

01:14:07.641 --> 01:14:09.107
Yeah?

01:14:09.109 --> 01:14:12.245
Yeah, I'll take that...
I got you.

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:15.080
And um...

01:14:15.082 --> 01:14:17.152
Just meet me at the bar.

01:14:17.551 --> 01:14:18.619
All right.

01:14:46.713 --> 01:14:47.983
Ella?

01:14:55.489 --> 01:14:56.925
Ella?

01:14:59.493 --> 01:15:00.962
Ella?

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:20.045
- How's she doing back there?
- I, uh, I don't know.

01:15:20.047 --> 01:15:22.982
- How much longer?
- Maybe, like, five miles.

01:15:22.984 --> 01:15:24.250
The clinic's
at the edge of town.

01:15:24.252 --> 01:15:26.052
Well, dude, we need
a fucking hospital.

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:28.821
- That's like an hour away.
- She's not gonna make that.

01:15:28.823 --> 01:15:32.023
What the fuck is wrong with her?
Just pinch her nose, tilt her head back

01:15:32.025 --> 01:15:33.095
or something.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.968
She's right out here.

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:43.535
Come on,
let's get her up.

01:15:43.537 --> 01:15:44.637
Gently.

01:15:44.639 --> 01:15:46.475
Let's go, come on.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.278
Hey.

01:15:50.979 --> 01:15:52.544
Just sit her
on the edge of the table,

01:15:52.546 --> 01:15:54.045
put her on her back gently.

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:57.148
Doctors.

01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:58.784
Step back, please.

01:15:58.786 --> 01:16:01.454
We were hiking, and we went to the
outpost and she started bleeding,

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:02.554
she just collapsed.

01:16:02.556 --> 01:16:04.456
Shit. Get them out of here.

01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:05.958
Is she okay?

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.695
We will come and get you. Now!

01:16:13.501 --> 01:16:14.436
Hurry up.

01:16:15.802 --> 01:16:17.139
Come on.

01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:30.461
- Cheers to it.
- No, no.

01:19:30.463 --> 01:19:32.897
No, go for it. One more time.

01:19:43.743 --> 01:19:45.313
Ready? You ready?

01:19:46.046 --> 01:19:47.278
Okay...

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.451
Ow!

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:51.886
Jesus, dude.

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:03.557
Get up.

01:21:04.658 --> 01:21:05.824
Get it.

01:21:05.826 --> 01:21:06.724
Hey,

01:21:06.726 --> 01:21:09.727
- what the hell happened?
- No, he did it.

01:21:09.729 --> 01:21:11.330
It was an accident.

01:21:11.332 --> 01:21:14.133
- Lay off, bro.
- Well, you shouldn't have been touching it in the first place.

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:15.366
It's fine, we'll fix it.

01:21:15.368 --> 01:21:17.303
-I slipped. Don't push me.

01:21:18.271 --> 01:21:20.039
Hey, stop it.

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.574
My fault? Get up, get up.

01:21:22.576 --> 01:21:24.613
Get...

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:26.946
Fine, stay down.

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:28.383
Stay down.

01:22:58.605 --> 01:23:00.938
Wait, what? Wait! Wait!
