Ted, what are you doing?

00:07.433 --> 00:08.658
Band practice.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.149
What band?

00:10.323 --> 00:11.548
Peons assemble!

00:12.490 --> 00:15.461
They have to stay within earshot,
it's in the band code.

00:15.692 --> 00:18.014
Wow, Ted,
it's kind of like you're their leader.

00:18.097 --> 00:19.232
Peons disperse!

00:21.352 --> 00:22.589
Peons assemble!

00:22.982 --> 00:24.316
Enough of the horse play!

00:24.399 --> 00:26.936
Now we need to practice,
and I can't have you winded.

00:27.156 --> 00:29.909
Now we've only got one shot
to convince Dr. Cox

00:29.992 --> 00:32.430
to let us sing for the sick kids
in pediatrics.

00:32.910 --> 00:33.790

<i>Yep, it was terrifying
going up against the new chief.</i>

00:58.376 --> 01:01.335
Perry, for the last time, we need
more negative pressure rooms

01:01.370 --> 01:02.766
in the infectious diseases ward.

01:04.075 --> 01:05.644
Huh, I didn't hear you knock.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.088
The door was open.

01:07.192 --> 01:10.282
Then go outside,
close the door, and knock.

01:10.539 --> 01:11.901
No, you're just going to lock it.

01:12.162 --> 01:12.872
No, I won't.

01:13.057 --> 01:14.722
You know I've been burned before.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.908

01:28.960 --> 01:30.857
There is no money in the budget.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.556
And while you're delivering
bad news, please tell Ted

01:33.639 --> 01:35.716
that he can't <i>sing in pediatrics.</i>

01:35.884 --> 01:38.557
A cappella music is,

01:42.759 --> 01:43.845
Guys, guys, guys!

01:44.286 --> 01:45.225
He said no.

01:45.393 --> 01:46.540
Oh man!

01:46.625 --> 01:49.708
Well maybe, he'll let us sing
for the people in the burn ward.

01:49.791 --> 01:50.809
No, I asked.

01:50.892 --> 01:53.060
He said they're already
in enough pain.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.979
Besides, Teddy, hospital already
has someone who sings to the kids.

01:56.170 --> 01:56.879
Who?

01:58.155 --> 02:01.225

# <i>And he smiled while...</i>

02:08.902 --> 02:10.189
That's a cute song.

02:10.732 --> 02:11.808
It's not cute.

Janice, you have one ugly baby.
Seriously.

02:29.532 --> 02:32.410
Did you actually teach your son
to be mean to a baby?

02:32.493 --> 02:35.818

You got to pick Jack up
from preschool today.

03:03.231 --> 03:04.246
Why can't you do it?

03:04.329 --> 03:06.290
Hello, I'll be busy taking care
of our daughter.

03:06.373 --> 03:08.003
Jennifer is with the nanny.

03:08.408 --> 03:09.537
Okay, fine.

03:09.725 --> 03:10.809
Jack's school gets out at 2:00

03:10.850 --> 03:13.859
and you know I take a nap
everyday from 11:30 to 3:00.

03:15.365 --> 03:16.960
Are you enjoying your life?

03:17.145 --> 03:19.157
Yeah, it's pretty nice.
And yours?

03:19.566 --> 03:20.653
It's different.

03:23.322 --> 03:24.866
Got your latte, champ.

03:25.142 --> 03:26.602
Well now, thank you.

03:26.685 --> 03:28.144
Boy oh boy, you're really digging

03:28.227 --> 03:30.427
the heck out of this whole secret
friendship thing, aren't you?

03:30.480 --> 03:32.652
Well, it has all
the thrill of an affair,

03:32.735 --> 03:34.613
without all that exhausting sex.

03:34.802 --> 03:37.450
Do you realize that I have
to do rounds,

03:37.494 --> 03:39.474
see patients,
pick up my son Jack,

03:39.557 --> 03:42.135
and somehow put a dent in all
this bureaucratic ridiculousness?

03:42.218 --> 03:43.464
You're the Chief of Medicine,

03:43.502 --> 03:46.627
you can't keep doing
all the things you used to do.

03:46.665 --> 03:49.017
You have to let something go.

03:49.171 --> 03:50.814
Just don't drop the ball
with your son.

03:51.126 --> 03:52.698
That's what I did with Harrison.

03:53.114 --> 03:56.179
He and his new life partner Caleb
have just opened a boutique 

03:56.222 --> 03:58.667
on Fire Island called
"Everything Mesh".

03:58.890 --> 04:00.335
You like mesh Perry?

04:00.613 --> 04:01.379
No, Bob, I don't.

04:01.434 --> 04:04.463
Well, I didn't either at first.
But the boxers really breathe.

04:05.174 --> 04:06.943
I can do it all.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.178
Craig,

04:09.279 --> 04:11.418
I thought I told you I never wanted
to see you in here again.

04:11.791 --> 04:12.729
I'm sick.

04:13.029 --> 04:14.583
I am now officially on the case.

04:15.294 --> 04:17.283
Can I talk to you
in the hall for one second?

04:17.849 --> 04:18.558
Sure.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.490
Look, I know you and Craig
have a history,

04:22.491 --> 04:24.031
but I'm sure you're swamped.

04:24.141 --> 04:25.522
I don't mind taking this one.

04:25.605 --> 04:28.582
No no, Craig was my patient before,
so he'll be my patient now.

04:28.665 --> 04:29.750
Plus, if you don't treat him,

04:29.815 --> 04:32.285
then he gets to get home
not smelling like cocoa butter.

04:32.567 --> 04:34.400
Mock away, but do you
think it's an accident

04:34.457 --> 04:36.570
that I have the complexion
of a 12-year-old Greek boy?

04:36.653 --> 04:38.714
Don't get me wrong,
I still want you to be

04:38.769 --> 04:41.165
a big part of Craig's treatment team.

04:41.524 --> 04:42.510
Say hum, Craig?

04:42.894 --> 04:45.849
Is there anything you want
Dr. Puberty Beard to go get for you?

04:45.932 --> 04:47.090
A root beer, please.

04:47.957 --> 04:49.090
Nice to have you on board.

04:54.578 --> 04:56.019
You took the last two root beers.

04:56.102 --> 04:57.205
- Give me one.
- No.

04:57.206 --> 04:59.743
This one is for a patient,
and this one...

05:01.614 --> 05:02.604
is for me.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.356
The old "Lick the can,
so no one will want it" trick.

05:05.552 --> 05:06.712
Too bad I beat you to it.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.233
Licked by Janitor.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.299
You'll find the same note
on your cell phone.

05:13.042 --> 05:15.200
Have you ever seen
such an angel?

05:16.260 --> 05:17.609
Okay Teddy.

05:17.805 --> 05:20.776
It's time to throw
down your power rap.

05:22.402 --> 05:24.194
Wow, look at Ted go!

05:26.475 --> 05:27.571
Can I help you?

05:27.654 --> 05:28.870
No you cannot!

05:34.228 --> 05:36.318
Yeah. Every time Ted
chickens out with a girl,

05:36.401 --> 05:38.216
he goes straight to his bike
and pedals home.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.517
Cherish the pain, Ted.

05:41.150 --> 05:42.915
It means youâ€™re still alive.

05:44.423 --> 05:46.918
I wish I could help
that bald sweaty bastard.

05:47.207 --> 05:48.457
Maybe you and I could team up.

05:48.568 --> 05:50.687
I bet you think I'm going to say no.

05:51.045 --> 05:53.048
But let me tell you
something about the Dorians.

05:53.131 --> 05:55.547
We trust. And we trust hard.

05:55.848 --> 05:59.856
It's the reason why every single
Dorian has a loyal army of friends.

06:00.422 --> 06:02.929
It's also why last weekend
I flew to the Ozarks

06:03.012 --> 06:06.176
for a spontaneous water ski
getaway with Dr. Cox.

06:06.913 --> 06:08.055
He was not there.

06:08.529 --> 06:10.370
Nor was his lakeside cabin.

06:11.260 --> 06:13.306
There had also been
talk of a tire swing.

06:13.622 --> 06:14.755
- In or out?
- In.

06:14.998 --> 06:16.385
- For Ted.
- For Ted.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.068
Yo, chief.

06:20.328 --> 06:23.199
For some reason, there are 3 different
shift schedules floating around.

06:23.282 --> 06:24.450
If you don't put out a new one,
you're going to get

06:24.500 --> 06:26.469
every nurse showing up
at the same time.

06:26.579 --> 06:27.296
I'm on it.

06:28.483 --> 06:30.118
Okay. Last patient.

06:30.201 --> 06:32.022
A pre-excitation of the ventricle

06:32.105 --> 06:35.176
due to accessory pathway's
a condition called what?

06:35.858 --> 06:38.609
It's Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
Nice job.

06:38.692 --> 06:39.661
I'm out of time, so...

06:39.709 --> 06:42.500
I'm going to go ahead and answer
these last questions myself.

06:42.545 --> 06:43.971
Now what is...?

06:44.723 --> 06:45.807
Let me finish.

06:45.890 --> 06:47.903
What is Ebstein's anomaly?

06:48.457 --> 06:50.644
Great job, group.
I appreciate the effort.

06:50.727 --> 06:51.755
Now leave.

06:52.283 --> 06:53.112
Not you.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.215
You didn't raise your hand,
not even once.

06:55.426 --> 06:56.537
I wasn't feeling it.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.170
Well, it's perfectly
understandable, but...

06:58.218 --> 07:00.894
for the record,
what is Ebstein's anomaly?

07:01.912 --> 07:03.110
Yes, dark haired guy.

07:03.303 --> 07:05.343
Oh, I thought it was just
the hand-rising part.

07:06.484 --> 07:08.347
Okay, I know I was supposed
to read up on that.

07:08.716 --> 07:10.559
But Dr. Cox, are you familiar

07:10.642 --> 07:12.868
with those electronic trivia games
they have at bars?

07:12.951 --> 07:13.333
Sure.

07:13.334 --> 07:16.873
My buddies and I bought one
at a police auction,

07:17.121 --> 07:19.254
and we've got this
really intense game going.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.673
And they're going to call me
whenever my team's turn comes up.

07:24.097 --> 07:26.320
Your laziness has finally
caught up with you.

07:26.361 --> 07:27.979
But, no worries.
As your teacher,

07:28.020 --> 07:30.298
I'm going to make sure
you get through all this because...

07:32.134 --> 07:34.515
The next two days, you're going
to sit your ass in that chair,

07:34.636 --> 07:38.033
and you are going to learn everything
there is to know about the human heart.

07:38.116 --> 07:40.383
I'm going to come around, every once
in a while, and ask you questions,

07:40.466 --> 07:43.101
and if you don't know the answer,
I'm going to take that textbook,

07:43.136 --> 07:45.347
and I'm going to drive it through
your skull. How does that sound?

07:45.532 --> 07:47.166
- Pretty frightening.
- Good luck.

07:49.284 --> 07:52.008
Look, Ted. You're obviously upset
about the ukulele girl.

07:52.403 --> 07:54.937
So, we've called a truce
to help you out.

07:55.566 --> 07:56.820
I'm not upset.

07:57.066 --> 07:59.755
Ted, we found you in a park,
throwing rocks at old couples.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.573
Why should they be happy?

08:01.986 --> 08:04.187
Come on, man!
You can get this girl.

08:04.310 --> 08:07.164
No, no, no,
you don't understand!

08:07.451 --> 08:10.177
If I even think about
a girl that hot,

08:10.236 --> 08:12.664
I get the most unbelievable
dry mouth.

08:12.855 --> 08:16.313
I mean, just picturing
her beautiful eyes and her cute sm--

08:24.704 --> 08:25.675
What is that?

08:26.672 --> 08:27.861
It's Jum and tonic.

08:28.078 --> 08:29.081
Gin, rum and tonic.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.303
Don't get him drunk.
He can barely talk as it is.

08:32.402 --> 08:34.164
You don't get drunk on Jum.

08:34.412 --> 08:36.096
It's a breakfast liqueur.

08:36.580 --> 08:37.441
And you know what?

08:37.509 --> 08:38.928
I don't like you telling me
what to do.

08:39.006 --> 08:39.923
Truce off.

08:40.552 --> 08:41.317
Truce on.

08:41.399 --> 08:43.227
That was a patient's lab results.

08:43.530 --> 08:45.677
And you cannot turn the truce off
whenever you want to.

08:45.704 --> 08:47.495
- Sure you can.
- Fine, truce off.

08:48.096 --> 08:50.120
No. Truce on!
Truce on! Truce on!

08:50.284 --> 08:52.430
It's my latte.
And it's scolding hot.

08:52.786 --> 08:54.152
Yeah it is.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.079
Ted, do you want to get this girl?

08:56.284 --> 08:59.401
Give her a present. Better yet,
a present that you made.

08:59.577 --> 09:02.066
My first date with Lady,
I made her a duck I killed.

09:02.474 --> 09:04.578
Now, you're thinking wouldn't it
have been more romantic

09:04.633 --> 09:05.610
to kill it in front of her?

09:05.699 --> 09:07.297
And yes, it would have.
And it was my plan.

09:07.394 --> 09:08.925
But in the car, on the way over,

09:09.966 --> 09:11.554
we kind of get into it, you know.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.452
Maybe I was in a bad mood,
maybe he was, I don't know.

09:13.494 --> 09:17.442
But one thing led to another, and then
we're off in the side of the road,

09:18.057 --> 09:20.672
shirtless and...
seeing what's what.

09:21.141 --> 09:22.262
Next thing I knew...

09:24.339 --> 09:27.019
I'm really not comfortable
murdering for her.

09:27.346 --> 09:29.761
Fine. The important thing
is to be confident.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.400
When you talk to her,
you think about something, anything,

09:32.451 --> 09:34.138
that puts you at a confident place.

09:34.273 --> 09:38.610
The important thing is to be honest.
Just tell her how you really feel.

09:39.009 --> 09:40.929
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

09:43.615 --> 09:45.132
Yep, those are Jum legs.

09:46.977 --> 09:47.841
All right, Craig.

09:47.992 --> 09:50.277
Your CAT scan showed
large lymph nodes,

09:50.278 --> 09:51.610
so you got to do a biopsy,

09:51.665 --> 09:53.639
which means we're going to
make a little cut under your arm,

09:53.640 --> 09:54.856
and take a tiny sample.

09:55.239 --> 09:56.361
It's going to hurt?

09:56.907 --> 09:58.168
A little bit, but...

09:58.269 --> 10:00.980
it's okay cause I'm going to be
by your side the whole way.

10:01.089 --> 10:02.058
You promise?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.265
Yeah, I promise.

10:04.505 --> 10:06.924
I got one thousand things
I got to attend to here,

10:06.990 --> 10:08.344
I'll check in with you later.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.729
Dr. Cox?

10:11.861 --> 10:12.640
Yeah.

10:12.704 --> 10:13.906
I'm scared.

10:15.606 --> 10:17.439
Why don't you tell me
what's scaring you,

10:17.603 --> 10:20.008
and we'll see what I can do
to make it better.

10:22.537 --> 10:23.205
Okay, Ted.

10:23.274 --> 10:26.203
I think we found a way to get you
over your fear of talking to this girl.

10:26.322 --> 10:28.595
Kill me?
Cause I'd be willing to try that.

10:28.663 --> 10:30.002
No, Ted. You remember
when you were a kid

10:30.065 --> 10:31.855
and your father threw you
in the deep end of the pool

10:31.896 --> 10:32.956
to teach you how to swim?

10:34.009 --> 10:35.158
Swim, Ted!

10:37.509 --> 10:38.433
Hey.

10:45.448 --> 10:46.938
Is our friend in there?

10:47.157 --> 10:48.660
He's in the corner.

10:53.007 --> 10:55.740
You just spooked him a little bit.
But if we're quiet,

10:55.741 --> 10:57.382
he'll come out on his own.

11:07.378 --> 11:08.444
Hey, guys.

11:08.881 --> 11:11.970
Did you have something
you wanted to talk to me about?

11:12.230 --> 11:15.601
<i>And then Ted remembered what
the janitor had said about confidence.</i>

11:15.943 --> 11:19.264
<i>And he knew that there was only
one situation where he actually had it.</i>

11:19.359 --> 11:20.712
Peons assemble!

11:22.809 --> 11:24.563
I heard you playing yesterday

11:24.604 --> 11:26.731
and thought you might
like to jam with us.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.826
I'm Teddy Buckland by the way.

11:29.332 --> 11:30.713
I'm Stephanie Gooch.

11:31.054 --> 11:31.977
Well, Gooch.

11:32.578 --> 11:34.257
See if you can keep up.

11:34.868 --> 11:38.563
# Carry on my wayward son

11:39.030 --> 11:42.189
# There'll be peace when you are done

11:42.590 --> 11:46.521
# Lay your weary head to rest

11:46.825 --> 11:49.353
# Don't you cry no more

11:49.844 --> 11:53.129
# Once I rose above
the noise and confusion...

11:53.165 --> 11:56.952
<i>As I watched Ted, I realized that
a little confidence is a good thing.</i>

11:57.999 --> 12:00.286
<i>But, as I saw Dr. Cox rush by,</i>

12:00.391 --> 12:03.138
<i>it occurred to me that too much
can get you into trouble.</i>

12:03.835 --> 12:06.204
<i>Because if you go around
plugging leaks all day,</i>

12:06.264 --> 12:08.009
Brian, the machine is broken.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.857
There's no way there was
a president named Garfield.

12:11.058 --> 12:13.641
Study, or get a book to the face.

12:13.889 --> 12:15.705
<i>you're bound to miss one.</i>

12:16.015 --> 12:18.569
Hey, if you're wondering,
this is what it looks like

12:18.604 --> 12:20.388
when all the nurses show up at once.

12:20.443 --> 12:21.890
I'll deal with it in a second.

12:22.558 --> 12:25.442
<i>And before you know it,
the flood gates open.</i>

12:26.098 --> 12:27.609
Where the hell is Craig?

12:27.738 --> 12:30.817
Seventeen nurses took him down
for his biopsy at two o'clock.

12:31.155 --> 12:32.549
It's past two already?

12:32.999 --> 12:35.513
<i>Then something big
falls through the cracks.</i>

12:37.435 --> 12:39.953
I will pick up Jack
after preschool today.

12:40.168 --> 12:41.969
My massage is right by there.

12:42.150 --> 12:43.817
I'm doing it. End of story.

12:44.256 --> 12:46.416
Go away!
You're not my doctor anymore.

12:46.908 --> 12:48.589
Puberty Beard is.

12:49.026 --> 12:51.898
You know, Craig, i was kind of hoping
that nickname wouldn't stick.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.352
Craig, I'm sorry. I just
got a little held up out there.

12:54.461 --> 12:57.277
I know it's not the thickest beard.
It's not like, you know, Santa Claus.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.697
You broke a promise.

12:59.259 --> 13:00.401
Well, have it your way.

13:03.578 --> 13:06.361
Just, real quick back to the beard,
you-- you want to touch it?

13:06.570 --> 13:07.750
I really don't.

13:10.907 --> 13:13.681
There is the stud muffin.
How'd it go with Gooch?

13:14.089 --> 13:15.445
We jammed all night.

13:15.623 --> 13:19.373
The two of us even sang one of
her songs which made me think

13:19.408 --> 13:21.869
I might have a chance with her.

13:27.497 --> 13:29.291
# I've got

13:29.492 --> 13:32.165
# Too many questions in my mind

13:32.857 --> 13:34.669
# I've got

13:34.904 --> 13:37.388
# Too many answers to find

13:38.094 --> 13:39.852
# Can I

13:40.053 --> 13:42.649
# Give up all I've imagined?

13:43.129 --> 13:45.534
# Am I

13:45.769 --> 13:47.726
# magical enough for this to happen?

13:47.857 --> 13:49.565
- # Because I like you
- # I like you

13:49.620 --> 13:51.410
- # I like you
- # I like you

13:53.228 --> 13:55.624
# And like can lead to like-like

13:55.801 --> 13:59.082
# And like-like can lead to love

13:59.242 --> 14:00.876
# Sure as the stars above,

14:00.966 --> 14:02.940
- # I'd really like to kiss you
- # I'd really like to screw you

14:04.308 --> 14:07.707
When we're singing, and the
band's around, everything's fine.

14:07.751 --> 14:11.855
But as soon as we're alone,
I literally can't breathe.

14:11.980 --> 14:13.777
Ted, you're never going to get
close to this woman 

14:13.822 --> 14:14.968
until you dig down deep,

14:15.009 --> 14:17.575
and find the courage
to tell her how you really feel.

14:18.426 --> 14:19.266
Yeah.

14:19.976 --> 14:21.221
What do you got?

14:21.348 --> 14:22.125
For the rest of your life,

14:22.245 --> 14:24.765
100 percent of your communications
with this woman should be in song.

14:25.059 --> 14:26.140
Loving it!

14:28.081 --> 14:30.498
So how is your day going today,
any better?

14:30.623 --> 14:31.452
I'm okay.

14:31.577 --> 14:34.417
Oh, give it up.
Everybody knows you two are friends.

14:35.870 --> 14:38.815
Oh, please, Carla.
I still hate Bobbo with a--

14:38.866 --> 14:40.520
We're like brothers.

14:40.645 --> 14:43.789
- I'm done hiding this, Perry.
- My head hurt.

14:43.914 --> 14:47.022
Well, you wouldn't be so stressed out
if you let people help you.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.065
Let me do the nurses schedule.

14:49.190 --> 14:49.887
No.

14:50.012 --> 14:53.021
You don't understand, Carla.
He has to control everything.

14:53.146 --> 14:54.384
Good, you're here.

14:54.509 --> 14:56.781
I'm surprised he doesn't try
to control the words I say.

14:56.906 --> 14:59.251
I can control the words you say.
Say something annoying.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.523
- I just--
- Ta-dah!

15:01.739 --> 15:03.316
Look, I've said this before.

15:03.441 --> 15:07.158
You cannot be Chief of Medicine
without giving something up.

15:07.213 --> 15:11.004
I mean, why on earth
is he still teaching interns?

15:11.129 --> 15:13.966
Because he loves teaching. He needs
to give up some of those patients.

15:14.001 --> 15:16.664
What he needs to do is give up
some of the bureaucratic stuff.

15:16.789 --> 15:19.410
Would you all be quiet for one second?

15:21.016 --> 15:21.803
Hey Dorian.

15:22.462 --> 15:24.484
Perry and I are like brothers now.

15:24.914 --> 15:27.126
Bob, he's not going
to take that well.

15:27.350 --> 15:30.961
I do everything for you
and you still won't let me in?

15:31.290 --> 15:34.794
You now what, thank you, Perry.
Thank you for giving me my life back.

15:34.795 --> 15:35.868
Because I am done.

15:35.903 --> 15:39.074
- JD, he needs our help.
- I'm back in. I'm here for you buddy.

15:39.388 --> 15:43.924
I don't need your help,
I am in control of everything.

15:47.634 --> 15:48.468
Hello?

15:48.710 --> 15:50.965
Daddy, you weren't here
to pick me up.

15:51.090 --> 15:53.768
So I got scared and tried to find you.

15:53.893 --> 15:55.280
- Jack?
- Daddy?

15:59.256 --> 15:59.909
Hey, Perr'.

16:00.908 --> 16:02.400
I'm alive!

16:06.015 --> 16:09.816
You know. Last weekend, Perry and I
went to the movies together.

16:10.141 --> 16:11.069
So?

16:11.419 --> 16:13.192
Thought you'd be interested.

16:13.317 --> 16:15.752
- Was it a romantic comedy?
- Yeah.

16:22.790 --> 16:24.433
Maybe they're all right.

16:25.103 --> 16:27.075
I have to give something up.

16:28.018 --> 16:30.689
Sweety, I got to talk
to your dad for a second.

16:31.275 --> 16:33.107
Go over there and staple some stuff.

16:33.363 --> 16:34.375
Cool!

16:35.675 --> 16:38.710
Perry, they don't know you like I do.

16:38.835 --> 16:41.950
You're not capable of giving up on
anything that you care about.

16:42.075 --> 16:46.034
Whether it's a patient, or your
never ending quest to please me.

16:46.159 --> 16:47.948
I'm going to blow you away tonight.

16:48.247 --> 16:50.185
I'm sure it'll be amazing.
My point is,

16:50.186 --> 16:52.527
is that eventually
you balance things out.

16:52.842 --> 16:55.918
Who cares if you can't pick
Jack up from preschool?

16:56.138 --> 16:59.249
Just make sure that you're home
in time for his bedtime stories.

16:59.596 --> 17:00.420
Thank you.

17:01.261 --> 17:02.317
Hey guys!

17:02.633 --> 17:05.111
I finally got a brother!

17:06.031 --> 17:07.980
Kid's either a genius or an idiot.

17:10.185 --> 17:13.214
Hey Ted, would you like
to get a cup of coffee some time?

17:13.695 --> 17:14.823
Peons!

17:16.413 --> 17:20.001
I was just thinking that maybe,
it could be the two of us.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.365
I thought maybe we could
get to know each other.

17:38.659 --> 17:40.698
You know, I'm an idiot.

17:40.823 --> 17:43.892
I've been dropping all these
subtle hints that I like you.

17:44.017 --> 17:48.048
Sideways glances, the secret smiles,
telling you I want to screw you.

17:48.173 --> 17:49.888
You're clearly not interested.

17:51.717 --> 17:52.749
Gooch!

17:54.255 --> 17:59.080
I'm really not what
you would call a winner.

17:59.850 --> 18:01.431
Oh sure, I'm a lawyer,

18:01.500 --> 18:05.350
but that's only because
I took the Bar exam in Alaska,

18:05.390 --> 18:07.852
and they only have like four laws

18:07.853 --> 18:11.451
and most of them are about
when you can and cannot kill...

18:11.900 --> 18:13.274
seals.

18:13.794 --> 18:16.954
And if it seems like
I'm uninterested,

18:16.999 --> 18:22.192
it's only because
I've no idea why you would like me.

18:22.854 --> 18:28.013
I mean, you are the
most beautiful, perfect...

18:28.148 --> 18:31.021
ukulele player I've ever seen.

18:31.948 --> 18:36.641
And no that's not saying much,
because they're usually fat Hawaiians.

18:37.579 --> 18:41.559
Still, I think what
I'm trying to say is...

18:43.015 --> 18:47.853
Stephanie, I would love
to go and have coffee with you.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.004
What time do you get off from work?

18:52.432 --> 18:53.732
Who cares?

18:57.544 --> 18:59.717
I guess you were right
about the whole honesty thing.

18:59.842 --> 19:01.204
Well, he never would have gotten
to that point

19:01.250 --> 19:02.957
if you hadn't told him
to be confident.

19:03.330 --> 19:05.214
- We're a good team.
- Yeah.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.854
Why is your hand wet?

19:09.193 --> 19:10.919
<i>Licked by Janitor.</i>

19:11.576 --> 19:12.936
I guess the truce is off.

19:13.061 --> 19:15.128
I'd like to think
it was never really on.

19:24.617 --> 19:26.801
I told you to leave me alone.

19:26.944 --> 19:27.997
Yeah you did.

19:28.933 --> 19:30.361
But I can't do that Craig.

19:30.846 --> 19:33.588
I screwed up,
I broke a promise to you.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.332
But I'm sorry.

19:35.833 --> 19:38.709
I'm standing here
asking you to forgive me.

19:40.741 --> 19:42.760
And I'm not leaving until you do.

19:43.485 --> 19:45.119
Make him go away.

19:45.244 --> 19:47.255
I can't, buddy.
I have a lot of patients to see.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.840
You're stuck with him.

19:51.311 --> 19:54.599
<i>As I watched Dr. Cox,
I realized, he was going to do it all.</i>

19:55.036 --> 19:57.173
<i>Even if it meant
compromising a little.</i>

19:57.443 --> 20:00.894
<i>Like letting a close friend
cross the T's and dot the I's</i>

20:01.019 --> 20:02.824
Here is the first pass
of the nurses schedule.

20:02.896 --> 20:05.439
Please feel free to make any changes
you want and put it out.

20:05.564 --> 20:06.774
No problem.

20:07.882 --> 20:10.828
<i>Or deciding not to bother teaching
someone who doesn't want to be taught.</i>

20:10.953 --> 20:11.990
Time's up.

20:12.115 --> 20:15.190
You patient has a sodium channel
abnormality in the cardiac tissue

20:15.238 --> 20:17.610
which puts him at risk of
sudden death, what does he have?

20:18.432 --> 20:20.514
Actually, I didn't get
to that chapter yet.

20:20.639 --> 20:22.606
There was this trivia thing,
did you know

20:22.658 --> 20:26.474
- James Garfield was our twenti--
- It's been two days. You're fired.

20:28.650 --> 20:31.600
<i>Still, it's all worth it
if you get home in time</i>

20:31.643 --> 20:33.706
<i>to read stories to your son.</i>

20:39.001 --> 20:41.631
It's okay.
You'll try again tomorrow.

20:43.060 --> 20:43.870
Come.

20:56.997 --> 21:00.602
Aren't we gonna, you know...
have intercourse?

21:00.727 --> 21:04.862
I would, but this isn't my fantasy.
It's that guy's.

21:07.216 --> 21:09.952
He doesn't want to imagine me
doing that with anyone.

21:11.952 --> 21:13.984
Oh what the hell.
Let's get free.

21:14.953 --> 21:16.468
Oh, Ted. No, no!

21:17.154 --> 21:19.807
What is that?
Is that your butt?

21:22.118 --> 21:23.165
