<i>He loves our children</i>
<i>like they're his own,</i>

this afternoon?

You all have fun?

"Jonathan Livingston Seagull."

00:38.038 --> 00:39.164
You should read this one.

- I will,
as soon as I get

00:40.582 --> 00:43.001
through that stack
of your books from last year.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.628
- And that's
why George Washington

00:45.670 --> 00:46.671
was a great man.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.259
- All right,

00:54.971 --> 00:56.306

00:56.348 --> 00:58.099

about George Washington

00:58.141 --> 00:59.351
and the cherry tree.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.894
- He rode everywhere
on horseback.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.270
- Oh, that's my kind of guy.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.272
All right, now say good night
to your mom.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.440

I tell you?

I feel moved by the spirit
to stand before you today.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.183
My family just moved
to Pocatello,

02:22.225 --> 02:25.812
and this community
has been so welcoming.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.358
In fact,
one family in particular,

02:30.400 --> 02:33.361
right here today,
in this room,

02:33.403 --> 02:35.280
welcomed us into their lives
a couple nights ago

02:35.321 --> 02:37.365
when they shared
a picnic with us

02:37.407 --> 02:38.700
right in our living room.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.577
[laughter]

02:40.618 --> 02:42.662
They made us feel like
we were one big family,

02:42.704 --> 02:45.415
and their daughter
even sang for us

03:02.557 --> 03:04.059
- Bishop.
- Well done.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.227

to me.

- Oh.

Well, uh...

10:32.799 --> 10:34.134

10:34.175 --> 10:38.847
if you would give Gail
some, you know, advice.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.307

10:41.349 --> 10:44.060

you're a very attractive woman,

Do you, honey?
- No.

And Jan's like family,

which is actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.732
You know,

- Oh--

I mean, don't you have any?

19:30.211 --> 19:32.255
- Well, Bob...

19:34.341 --> 19:37.260
Unfortunately,
my brother's not in the church

19:37.302 --> 19:39.679
and Gail's brother
is a homosexual.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.765
But you think about it,
Broberg.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.309
We sure would be happy
to return the favor

19:44.351 --> 19:45.894

19:45.935 --> 19:47.896
- Oh, well,
that's an awfully kind offer,

19:47.937 --> 19:49.356
but, uh...

19:49.397 --> 19:50.774
if anything were
to happen to us,

19:50.815 --> 19:52.400
the girls would go
to my twin brother, Dick.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.693
- Mm.
- Yeah.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.863
It's already been arranged
and agreed to.

to think about this,

about the process.

37:51.855 --> 37:54.024
- Brother B.

37:54.065 --> 37:55.608
- I, uh...

37:58.987 --> 38:00.488
I stepped on your toes,

38:00.530 --> 38:02.574
and I should've seen it,

38:02.615 --> 38:06.119
but I was too wrapped up

38:06.161 --> 38:08.455
in my own--

38:08.496 --> 38:10.582
my own self and my own kids.

38:12.375 --> 38:15.545
Jasper's got
quite a crush on Jan,

38:15.587 --> 38:17.839
and he was pushing
for her to come, and...

38:25.972 --> 38:27.849
I messed up.

38:28.725 --> 38:31.311
And the love and respect
I have for you and Mary Ann,

38:31.353 --> 38:33.855
in my heart...

38:33.897 --> 38:36.149
I see what I did,

38:36.191 --> 38:37.734
and I owe you an apology.

38:39.861 --> 38:42.113
So that's it.

38:42.155 --> 38:43.406
I'm sorry.

38:46.785 --> 38:48.578
- Um...
[clears throat]

38:48.620 --> 38:52.499
Thank you, B, for...

38:52.540 --> 38:56.044
those kind
and sincere sentiments.

38:57.337 --> 39:00.131
- Let me take you out
to dinner

39:00.173 --> 39:02.467
as a gesture of apology.

39:02.509 --> 39:03.718
My treat?

39:07.222 --> 39:10.183
<i>[gentle music]</i>

39:10.225 --> 39:11.643

39:11.685 --> 39:15.146
They put the lights lower
here at dinner than lunch.

39:15.188 --> 39:17.148
- Yeah, I haven't been here
for dinner.

39:19.359 --> 39:20.819
- Me neither.

39:24.656 --> 39:28.034
I am so happy, Broberg.

39:30.036 --> 39:33.248
Didn't feel right
having conflict with you.

39:33.289 --> 39:35.917
- Well, I appreciate that.

39:37.460 --> 39:40.213
- I know I'm too attached
to your family.

39:40.255 --> 39:41.589
I know.

39:43.091 --> 39:44.509
And I'm ashamed of myself

39:44.551 --> 39:47.637
in the way
I've violated your boundaries.

39:49.681 --> 39:52.267
You see, my--my childhood,

39:52.308 --> 39:54.477
it wasn't as nice as what
we're giving the kids here.

39:59.107 --> 40:00.608
[exhales sharply]

40:02.736 --> 40:05.822
You see,
when I was growing up,

40:05.864 --> 40:07.907
my stepfather didn't want me.

40:10.160 --> 40:11.619
He misused me.

40:13.121 --> 40:16.291
Heck, the hired help
around the property misused me.

40:16.332 --> 40:17.667
I was trash.

40:18.877 --> 40:21.504
And the only thing
I could offer

40:21.546 --> 40:24.174
was that I took care
of my little sister.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.176
It's the only reason
he let me sleep in the house.

40:27.594 --> 40:31.264
So all my life,

40:31.306 --> 40:35.101
some part of me thinks

40:35.143 --> 40:37.103
if I could just make

40:37.145 --> 40:39.606
a kid like her happy...

40:41.024 --> 40:45.236
Maybe I'd be worthy of respect.

40:45.278 --> 40:50.283
So I just want to be worthy
of your respect, Broberg.

40:50.325 --> 40:51.618
Yours and Mary Ann's.

40:51.659 --> 40:54.579
- You are.
You are worthy.

40:54.621 --> 40:57.957
Every man has worth
in the eyes of the Lord.

40:57.999 --> 41:01.795
- Well, they say that, but...

41:03.755 --> 41:07.258
When I was a boy,
I did some shameful things.

41:10.929 --> 41:12.180
- B.

41:14.349 --> 41:16.685
Nobody's perfect,

41:16.726 --> 41:18.061
myself included.

41:20.689 --> 41:22.565
- What did you ever do wrong?

41:22.607 --> 41:24.359
- Oh, nothing much.

41:24.401 --> 41:26.319
[chuckles]

41:26.361 --> 41:28.321
Just...

41:28.363 --> 41:30.490
Well,

41:30.532 --> 41:32.534
when you mentioned, uh...

41:35.704 --> 41:40.834
I did things too
when I was a little boy.

41:41.835 --> 41:44.254
You know, kid stuff.

41:46.339 --> 41:47.632
- Like what?

41:47.674 --> 41:49.342
- Nothing.

41:49.384 --> 41:50.927
- I think it'd help me to hear.

41:50.969 --> 41:52.804
- Oh.

41:52.846 --> 41:56.016
You know, sometimes,

41:56.057 --> 42:01.688
you know,
with the old neighborhood gang,

42:01.730 --> 42:04.357
we would, uh,

42:04.399 --> 42:07.694
sometimes...

42:07.736 --> 42:10.363
mess around.

42:10.405 --> 42:12.699
- Mess around how?

42:12.741 --> 42:14.868
- Nothing.
Just...

42:21.207 --> 42:23.418
We'd look at, uh...

42:23.460 --> 42:26.588
We'd look at, uh, girly books.

42:28.757 --> 42:31.343
Topless ladies, and...

42:34.679 --> 42:37.849
Well, we'd, um...

42:39.893 --> 42:42.604
We'd touch each other.

42:42.645 --> 42:45.648
But that was
just dumb boy stuff.

42:45.690 --> 42:49.069
That's...
[clears throat]

42:49.110 --> 42:50.945
- Hey, Bob.

42:52.405 --> 42:54.699
There's no need
to feel bad about that.

42:57.285 --> 42:58.912
That's normal.

43:00.455 --> 43:01.748
That's normal!

43:01.790 --> 43:03.792
[both chuckle]

43:03.833 --> 43:06.086
- You're--you're right.
You're right.

43:06.127 --> 43:07.462
It's...

43:07.504 --> 43:08.922
It's normal.

43:08.963 --> 43:12.175
- Oh, you had me scared
for a minute there, Bob.

43:12.217 --> 43:14.469
I'm thinking,
what is Broberg gonna say now?

43:14.511 --> 43:17.681
[both laugh]

43:17.722 --> 43:19.224
Oh, brother.

43:22.477 --> 43:23.770
- Toothpick?

43:23.812 --> 43:25.188
- No, thank you.

43:33.488 --> 43:35.990
I had a real nice time tonight.

43:36.032 --> 43:37.158
- Me too.

43:48.211 --> 43:49.838
- [sighs]

43:56.177 --> 43:58.346
You remember when I was
talking about my marriage?

43:59.681 --> 44:01.474
- Sure.

44:01.516 --> 44:03.643
- Yeah.

44:03.685 --> 44:05.061
Only gotten worse.

44:06.688 --> 44:09.024
- I'm sorry.

44:09.065 --> 44:12.068
You know, maybe there's
a professional you both could--

44:12.110 --> 44:14.863
- No, I'm just so darn
sexually frustrated.

44:14.904 --> 44:17.490
It's...
[blows raspberry]

44:17.532 --> 44:20.285
- Well, just...

44:20.326 --> 44:25.290
think about your vows
and ask the Lord to...

44:25.331 --> 44:27.959
- Yeah, I don't know
what to do about it.

44:34.758 --> 44:36.384
You remember that...

44:38.428 --> 44:40.638
Stuff you did
with the other boys?

44:40.680 --> 44:43.516
You know, the--

44:43.558 --> 44:46.102
the kid stuff?

44:46.144 --> 44:47.228
- Yeah.

44:52.192 --> 44:54.402
- If you really care
about me, Broberg...

44:57.489 --> 44:59.240
I need a little bit of that.

45:02.911 --> 45:06.581
- [stammers]

45:06.623 --> 45:09.626
Brother B, that's...

45:09.668 --> 45:10.877
- Please?

45:12.170 --> 45:13.922
Just help me out, brother.

45:15.382 --> 45:16.925
Just this once.

45:20.595 --> 45:23.390
- I...

45:23.431 --> 45:25.433
I don't--I don't know, B.

45:26.851 --> 45:29.396
- Please.

45:29.437 --> 45:31.022
Think about my marriage.

45:32.982 --> 45:36.778
I need your help
to avoid a more sinful action.

45:38.738 --> 45:41.199
- I-I-I-I--

45:41.241 --> 45:45.662
I want to help you, B,
but I don't--

45:45.704 --> 45:47.664
- Are you really
gonna leave me alone

45:47.706 --> 45:50.000
to deal with this
on my own, Bob?

45:50.959 --> 45:54.170

Real bad.

at the end there.
