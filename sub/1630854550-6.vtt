01:30.840 --> 01:32.400
In the interest of discretion,

01:32.440 --> 01:34.840
I thought it best to drop by
in person.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.520
At one o'clock in the morning?

01:36.560 --> 01:38.160
The minister was at the opera...

01:39.440 --> 01:41.880
..which meant
we had to wait to get his signature.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.360
Gotterdammerung?

01:48.400 --> 01:49.800
Beg your pardon?

01:49.840 --> 01:53.280
Wagner. Opera joke. Never mind.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.360
Thank you, no.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.360
Where have you been tonight?

02:17.400 --> 02:21.120
Saying goodbye to a friend.
Anyone I know?

02:21.160 --> 02:23.760
Jim Angleton.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.680
On his way home to Washington
as we speak.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.600
When did you last see Tony Blunt?

02:32.640 --> 02:34.640
Sure I can't tempt you?
Quite sure.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.320
Sir Anthony and I,
as I suspect you well know,

02:43.360 --> 02:45.480
had lunch the other day at my club.

02:46.920 --> 02:50.160
Why? You haven't gone
and lost him, have you?

02:52.160 --> 02:56.080
I should never have agreed
to let you go to Beirut.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.120
KNOCKING

02:58.160 --> 03:00.000
Sounds like one of yours.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.080
Sounds like one of yours.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.280
Don't tell me, panic over -
Blunt's resurfaced.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.920
Nine o'clock sharp. My office.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.440
Don't be late.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.240
DOOR CLOSES

03:47.520 --> 03:49.800
I... just lost my footing.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.920
Questions are being asked, Kim.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.600
I slipped on the ice, for God's
sake! People are worried about you!

03:54.640 --> 03:59.080
On my way to the Metropol. I was
hoping to find you or Burgess...

03:59.120 --> 04:00.000
preferably you.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.680
preferably you.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.800
A friendly face. Some music.
A little fucking colour.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.120
Which reminds me...

04:09.240 --> 04:11.640
..Burgess sent a peace offering.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.760
From his personal library,
he wanted me to tell you.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.680
Clever bastard.

04:20.280 --> 04:23.040
Do you know this one?

04:23.080 --> 04:27.040
Takes place in London in 1934...

04:27.080 --> 04:29.400
when no-one yet knew
what they stood for.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.240
Also some tinned fruit,
a jar of marmalade,

04:35.280 --> 04:37.760
cigarettes
and a couple of other bits and bobs.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.040
All from Guy?

04:39.080 --> 04:42.520
The marmalade's from me - Fortnum
and Mason's via diplomatic pouch.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.120
Ooh, speaking of which,
pass my coat.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.080
I have a letter I need you to send.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.400
To whom?
Oh.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.200
Oh, damn, it's gone.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.760
I couldn't trouble you to rustle up
some paper and an envelope?

05:05.760 --> 05:07.520
Paper and envelope.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.680
Er...

05:08.720 --> 05:10.960
Medsestra! Medsestra!

05:44.240 --> 05:45.920
Good morning, sir.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.560
Mr Elliott.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.720
Have a seat.

06:22.440 --> 06:28.080
Mrs Thomas here is of the opinion
that... Philby told you

06:28.120 --> 06:30.000
Tony Blunt was also
a Russian double agent.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.160
Tony Blunt was also
a Russian double agent.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.600
She's right. He did.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.520
And that that's
the reason you let him go?

06:42.720 --> 06:45.760
Something tells me Mrs Thomas
is quite a bit cleverer than that.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.280
When did he give you Blunt?

06:51.800 --> 06:53.280
The last day.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.360
Out on the balcony?
Yes.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.080
Where no-one could hear you?

06:59.680 --> 07:00.000
I'll have to take your word
for that.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.240
I'll have to take your word
for that.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.560
Why haven't you disclosed
any of this until now?

07:09.760 --> 07:14.040
I'd just learned that the man
I trusted most in the Service

07:14.080 --> 07:17.840
and my best friend
was a Russian spy.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.400
You could say I'm not quite sure
who to trust any more.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.320
You understand that any information
acquired in Beirut from Philby

07:27.880 --> 07:30.000
is considered
counter-intelligence...

07:30.040 --> 07:31.560
which is now the domain of MI5?

07:31.600 --> 07:34.640
What I understand is that
this is a show for the minister.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.960
A pissing contest
between MI5 and SIS.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.240
No contest, I'm afraid,
thanks to Philby.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.480
Exactly.
I thought you were off the case.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.720
KNOCK
Number 10 on the line, sir.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.040
Concerning?

07:50.120 --> 07:51.760
Profumo.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.640
Educated guess.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.000
If you wouldn't mind waiting
in the ante room for a few minutes,

08:00.000 --> 08:00.320
If you wouldn't mind waiting
in the ante room for a few minutes,

08:00.360 --> 08:03.480
I'm sure Miss Harbinson will be
happy to find you some refreshment.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.120
Not you, Mrs Thomas.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.080
You stay where you are.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.120
I don't know about this, Kim.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.000
It's a personal letter,
it's nothing more...

08:31.840 --> 08:34.720
..separating friendship
from politics.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.960
Which there was no time for
in Beirut?

08:39.160 --> 08:40.440
SIGHS

08:42.240 --> 08:44.400
I'm tired, Donald.

08:44.440 --> 08:48.120
So fucking... fucking tired.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.160
I didn't seal the envelope.

08:52.200 --> 08:56.520
Read it if you want. Run it
by your KGB chums if you must.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.000
They're your chums, too.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.240
They're your chums, too.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.840
Well, then there shouldn't be
a problem, should there?

10:00.680 --> 10:04.160
The cricket starts today.
England and Australia.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.520
I was rather hoping to catch
some of that on the wireless later.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.760
Ah, well, we should get on with it,
then.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.600
Their fast bowlers
should be quite a handful.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.760
But I think our batsmen
will be up to it this time.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.280
Dinner's at eight, by the way.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.720
You haven't forgotten?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.320
Do you think
you could do that upstairs?

10:41.400 --> 10:42.680
RINGING

10:45.040 --> 10:46.560
Jane.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.640
You look... Well...

10:49.680 --> 10:52.600
Well, I must admit,
all things considered,

10:52.640 --> 10:54.520
I actually feel quite chipper.

10:54.560 --> 11:00.000
No, I meant comma, well,
dot, dot, dot, how do I put it?

11:00.000 --> 11:00.720
No, I meant comma, well,
dot, dot, dot, how do I put it?

11:00.760 --> 11:04.000
BUZZER
You can go in now.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.720
How's your head, by the way?

11:18.760 --> 11:21.680
Oh, it's still there. By a thread.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.120
So...

11:32.800 --> 11:35.680
..last night... at the St Georges...

11:36.800 --> 11:39.160
You went to the St Georges...
without me?

11:39.200 --> 11:40.480
Fuck off, Kim.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.000
Wait... Now I'm lost...
Are you telling me I was there?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.440
Wait... Now I'm lost...
Are you telling me I was there?

11:44.480 --> 11:47.000
At the bar?
The pool.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.200
Ah. Golly.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.920
Well... that explains this, then.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.880
Do you think
I might have a glass of water?

12:24.400 --> 12:25.680
More?

12:29.240 --> 12:30.920
Right.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.920
So, here's the scoop...

12:39.600 --> 12:42.040
..but first,
you owe me a proper drink.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.240
It all began in... Vienna.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.120
In '34?

13:16.480 --> 13:19.440
February... 1934.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.160
Not before then, up at Cambridge?

13:23.600 --> 13:25.760
Cambridge? Oh, no.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.920
Cambridge is where you fantasise
about what you stand against...

13:33.320 --> 13:35.520
..whereas, Vienna...

13:39.680 --> 13:43.000
..that was where I quickly learned
what I stood for.

13:43.000 --> 13:43.080
..that was where I quickly learned
what I stood for.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.880
Who recruited you?

13:47.400 --> 13:48.400
No-one.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.760
I fell in love.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.440
'You fell in love?'

14:18.480 --> 14:21.560
ACCORDION MUSIC

14:21.600 --> 14:25.400
MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH

14:25.440 --> 14:27.120
Stop it there, please.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.600
Which one of you opened the window?
Him.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.480
Though you must've known
that would interfere

14:32.520 --> 14:33.760
with the listening equipment?

14:33.800 --> 14:37.360
I suppose I assumed whoever selected
the safe house and bugged it

14:37.400 --> 14:39.840
would've taken an open window
into account

14:39.880 --> 14:41.760
in the Mediterranean climate.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.000
What utter nonsense, Nick.

14:43.000 --> 14:43.400
What utter nonsense, Nick.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.320
It's 1963, I don't think
it's too much to ask!

14:46.360 --> 14:48.760
It's the debriefer's job
to control the damned environment!

14:48.800 --> 14:51.720
You had to have known
opening a window could be a tactic.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.040
I viewed it more
in psychological terms.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.560
It told me that
he was on the brink of capitulating

14:57.600 --> 15:00.560
but needed to create
a sense of privacy

15:00.600 --> 15:03.120
before baring his soul,
so to speak.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.320
The tape is supposed to be evidence.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.000
I didn't go to Beirut to solve
a crime. I knew he was guilty.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.440
We all knew he was guilty.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.000
I'm a spy, not a policeman.
It's interesting.

15:13.000 --> 15:13.040
I'm a spy, not a policeman.
It's interesting.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.720
You almost sounded vindicated
just then.

15:17.760 --> 15:22.640
Like a man who'd succeeded in what
he went out there to accomplish.

15:22.680 --> 15:26.760
If he succeeded,
then it'd be Philby sitting here now

15:26.800 --> 15:28.760
and the Russians
would be none the wiser.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.760
So from this point on, we're
supposed to rely on your account

15:33.800 --> 15:35.600
of what happened in that flat.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.360
Do you honestly mean to tell me

15:37.400 --> 15:40.920
MI5 doesn't have
the wherewithal to enhance the tape?

15:40.960 --> 15:43.000
There is, of course... another way
to think about all this...

15:43.000 --> 15:46.880
There is, of course... another way
to think about all this...

15:46.920 --> 15:48.280
which is that the three minutes

15:48.320 --> 15:53.200
you and Philby spent on that balcony
is in fact a distraction.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.600
A piece of misdirection...

15:55.640 --> 15:59.520
because I have to say, three minutes
does seem like a very short time,

15:59.560 --> 16:02.520
indeed, the end of
such a long friendship,

16:02.560 --> 16:05.880
in which to... bare one's soul...

16:07.120 --> 16:09.240
..leaving me to consider
the possibility that

16:09.280 --> 16:12.840
the real truth about why you let
Philby go isn't even on the tape.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.320
Thoughts, Mrs Thomas?

16:26.840 --> 16:28.440
You fell in love?

16:30.440 --> 16:32.120
SNIGGERS

16:33.520 --> 16:35.560
Oh, come on, you've gotta laugh.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.000
Everything you need to know
is in there.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.840
Everything you need to know
is in there.

16:52.040 --> 16:56.160
Perhaps you'll now allow me to go
home and listen to the cricket.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.880
Is this it? Where's the rest of it?

17:00.920 --> 17:03.080
Names, dates, operations...

17:03.120 --> 17:05.400
That's all there is.
That's all I know.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.320
A list of your Soviet handlers
from the '30s.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.800
Are any of these people still active
or even alive?

17:16.280 --> 17:19.880
It says here you severed all contact
with Soviet Intelligence

17:19.920 --> 17:22.360
right at the end of the war,
in 1945,

17:22.400 --> 17:25.000
"having seen the error of my ways".

17:25.040 --> 17:27.040
Which you've said yourself.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.640
Come here.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.320
Your funeral.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.680
What's the Russian for cheese?

18:01.720 --> 18:03.080
I don't know.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.000
Say it in English, then.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.720
Are you trying to get me killed?

18:06.760 --> 18:08.120
Now, there's a thought.

18:09.560 --> 18:10.880
You don't really mean that.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.000
Give me one good reason why not,
Kim,

18:13.000 --> 18:13.520
Give me one good reason why not,
Kim,

18:13.560 --> 18:15.600
and it better be a fucking good one.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.240
Tell me you understand why
I said you severed all contact

18:24.280 --> 18:26.240
with the KGB in 1945.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.440
The benefit of the Americans...

18:29.480 --> 18:31.080
to protect our relationship
with them.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.640
I don't give a toss about
the special relationship. Try again.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.600
You said it to protect me.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.560
To protect you.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.680
Because as we both know,
you've been very busy for the KGB

18:56.720 --> 18:58.760
until right fucking now.

19:02.720 --> 19:06.360
Am I correct in saying your
operating thesis with Philby was

19:06.400 --> 19:08.640
that friendship trumps ideology?

19:09.720 --> 19:13.000
Even though men like Philby
put ideology above all else?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.160
Even though men like Philby
put ideology above all else?

19:14.200 --> 19:16.440
What other men like Philby
do you know?

19:16.480 --> 19:17.520
If I may, ma'am,

19:17.560 --> 19:20.960
I think it'd be a mistake to see
Philby as purely ideological.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.080
He just defected
to the Soviet Union!

19:23.120 --> 19:26.560
She's right. A spy is
an adventurer, an opportunist...

19:26.600 --> 19:30.600
An elitist. And to work for the KGB
from within SIS

19:30.640 --> 19:33.320
put Philby
in an even more elite group.

19:33.360 --> 19:37.160
Burgess, Maclean, Philby, Blunt...

19:37.200 --> 19:39.200
Four men.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.000
Are you implying there are more?

19:43.000 --> 19:43.480
Are you implying there are more?

19:44.520 --> 19:46.000
Aren't we all?

20:02.560 --> 20:05.840
You admit to tipping off
Burgess and Maclean in '51.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.080
Out of loyalty to my friends.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.240
Who's your handler?

20:17.280 --> 20:18.920
I don't have one.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.760
How could I
if I broke contact with the KGB?

20:21.800 --> 20:23.520
ACCORDION PLAYS OUTSIDE

20:23.560 --> 20:26.440
Please tell me you're not paying
that bugger to play all day.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.720
SIGHS
He is rather good, though, isn't he?

20:43.600 --> 20:45.640
Take a butcher's at that.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.840
Confirm which of these men
is working for the Russians

20:56.880 --> 20:59.400
and I'll know
you're taking this seriously.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.800
A test.
I know. The temerity of it.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.800
You're fishing.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.800
Take it away with you
and give it to me at dinner tonight.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.720
I take it I'm still invited?

21:12.080 --> 21:13.000
Tim Milne? You've been
a friend of his for years.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.320
Tim Milne? You've been
a friend of his for years.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.720
Well, surely by that logic,

21:17.760 --> 21:19.800
your name should be
at the top of this list.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.680
See you at eight.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.320
Are you all right?
Never better.

21:35.720 --> 21:39.680
Were you fishing?
Yes.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.720
Who was on that list?

21:41.760 --> 21:43.000
Friends and associates of
Burgess, Maclean and Philby.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.600
Friends and associates of
Burgess, Maclean and Philby.

21:45.640 --> 21:49.520
Specifically.
Why does it matter?

21:49.560 --> 21:53.080
I've already told you
I was bluffing. Humour us.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.600
Tim Milne...

22:01.880 --> 22:04.080
..John Cairncross, Tony Blunt,

22:04.120 --> 22:08.120
Guy Liddell, and one or two others
I might be forgetting.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.000
Blunt was on the list?

22:13.000 --> 22:13.080
Blunt was on the list?

22:15.080 --> 22:18.520
Thanks to his close friendship
with Guy Burgess,

22:18.560 --> 22:20.280
dating back to their Cambridge days.

22:20.320 --> 22:23.440
Earlier...
you said Philby gave you Blunt

22:23.480 --> 22:27.160
when you were out on the balcony...
unless I'm missing something.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.760
So if he'd already given you
Blunt...

22:30.800 --> 22:33.280
why then go through all the
rigmarole with the list of names?

22:33.320 --> 22:34.680
Surely you already had your man.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.200
I was worried Blunt was chickenfeed.

22:39.640 --> 22:43.000
And then that same evening,
you went to dinner at the Philbys'.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.800
And then that same evening,
you went to dinner at the Philbys'.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.560
Yes.
Why?

22:46.600 --> 22:50.040
Certain friends of ours
had got wind that I was in Beirut.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.560
American friends?
Among others.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.160
Of Philby's American wife.
And if I didn't go to dinner,

22:56.200 --> 22:58.960
then it might've tipped them
off that something was amiss.

23:00.960 --> 23:05.280
That's it? That's the only reason
you went? That's it.

23:05.320 --> 23:08.320
It's also the reason why you let
Philby go home that afternoon.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.320
Correct.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.440
Boy, are you on my shit list.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.000
Three days you've been in town
and not a peep! Give me those.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.680
Three days you've been in town
and not a peep! Give me those.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.200
Something smells delicious.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.560
That'll be me.
JAZZ MUSIC

24:16.240 --> 24:17.000
MUSIC STOPS
Bravo.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.040
MUSIC STOPS
Bravo.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.040
APPLAUSE
Jolly good.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.720
Ah! Here he is.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.320
Good Lord,
look what the cat dragged in!

24:25.360 --> 24:28.560
Kim was just regaling us
with some of your dirty limericks.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.640
Oh, good Lord, I hope not.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.080
Hello, there.
Senorita from Pisa.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.520
I sleep-a with whomever I please-a.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.600
How's the rest of it go?

24:37.640 --> 24:40.160
Ah, no clue. That one was Kim's.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.440
I was merely an innocent bystander.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.320
The laughs we've had, eh, Nick? Eh?
Right.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.000
Ah, what about this?
You'll remember this one.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.760
Ah, what about this?
You'll remember this one.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.920
Ah, Elliott, just the fellow.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.760
Sit down, I'd like a frank word
with you.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.240
I'm not sure now's the right time...

24:54.280 --> 24:56.320
Does your wife know what you do?

24:56.360 --> 24:59.600
Kim, darling, everyone's already
heard that God knows how many...

24:59.640 --> 25:04.680
Darling, please! If you don't mind.
Come on, for old times' sake.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.520
This actually happened to him,
verbatim, right?

25:07.560 --> 25:09.720
Right.
Ready?

25:09.760 --> 25:12.000
Does your wife know what you do?

25:13.440 --> 25:16.520
Yes.
How-How did that come about?

25:17.640 --> 25:20.040
Well, she was my secretary
for a couple of years,

25:20.080 --> 25:22.000
and I think
the penny must have dropped.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.840
Ah, quite so. Quite.
And what about your mother?

25:26.520 --> 25:29.120
She thinks
I'm in something called SIS,

25:29.160 --> 25:32.400
which she believes stands
for Secret Intelligence Service.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.880
Good God! How-How-How did
she come to know that?

25:37.040 --> 25:39.760
A member of the war cabinet told her
at a cocktail party.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.040
POLITE LAUGHTER

25:42.080 --> 25:45.280
Dinner is served. A table, everyone.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.120
You forgot this earlier.

25:52.160 --> 25:55.800
CHATTERING

25:55.840 --> 25:59.160
Nicholas, will we have you here,
please? Oh, lovely. Thank you.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.720
De Gaulle may be French,
but he ain't no dummy.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.520
He knows where your loyalties lie.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.480
Oh, do tell, I so love a lecture.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.560
The Brits care about two things
and two things only,

26:08.600 --> 26:11.080
neither one of which is
goddamn Europe.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.240
Bangers and mash.

26:13.280 --> 26:17.000
The monarchy. And America.
The monarchy and America.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.000
Where are you going, darling?

26:21.040 --> 26:22.600
Do you wanna know something funny?

26:24.320 --> 26:27.240
Windsor isn't even
the royal family's real name.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.600
They changed it
from Witten to Windsor.

26:30.640 --> 26:35.520
The Wittens of Saxe-Coburg
and... something or other...

26:35.560 --> 26:38.520
Gotha Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.440
They're bloody krauts,
for pity's sake!

26:41.480 --> 26:46.000
And did you also know...
that Anthony Blunt... Kim.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.000
..Sir Anthony Blunt, I should say,
a cousin of the Queen's...

26:47.000 --> 26:48.880
..Sir Anthony Blunt, I should say,
a cousin of the Queen's...

26:48.920 --> 26:50.920
Distant cousin by marriage.

26:50.960 --> 26:56.840
Did you know that MI5 sent him
on a secret trip to Berlin

26:56.880 --> 26:58.360
right after the war

26:58.400 --> 27:03.560
to recover some rather compromising
correspondence

27:03.600 --> 27:06.720
from certain members
of the royal family

27:06.760 --> 27:11.080
to certain members of the Third
Reich, including Hitler himself?

27:11.120 --> 27:13.240
Isn't that right, Nick?

27:13.280 --> 27:16.960
And now Germany is
the front line of the Cold War,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.600
and the Wittens of Saxe-Coburg
and Gotha are now the...

27:20.640 --> 27:23.840
HIS VOICE FADES

27:31.000 --> 27:34.720
..under the aegis of
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.600
I'm not sure I completely follow!

27:36.640 --> 27:40.800
But that's not bad for...
how much have you had to drink?

27:40.840 --> 27:44.880
Dear old England, however,
with an ever watchful eye

27:44.920 --> 27:47.000
on which side her bread is buttered,

27:47.000 --> 27:47.560
on which side her bread is buttered,

27:47.600 --> 27:51.640
has been grooming
a new patron to serve.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.920
To, to appease.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.800
To... Rrrrr! ..fellate.

27:56.840 --> 28:00.760
Oh, good Lord!
Kim, is that really necessary?

28:00.800 --> 28:04.680
That's right, you guessed it...
Old donkey dick herself.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.400
The United States of America.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.360
What about Russia?

28:09.400 --> 28:11.000
Where do they fit in all of this?

28:11.040 --> 28:12.440
Please don't encourage him, Nick.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.160
He's not trying to encourage me,
darling.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.360
He's trying to shut me up.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.800
You see, my best friend here...

28:23.120 --> 28:25.720
..has been sent
all the way from London...

28:26.800 --> 28:29.480
..to do what, exactly, Nick?

28:31.520 --> 28:35.720
Check your liver.
LAUGHTER

28:35.760 --> 28:38.360
Old donkey dick herself!

28:38.400 --> 28:40.200
I gotta write that one down.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.240
I need some fucking air.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.640
Oh, air, my ass!

28:44.680 --> 28:47.000
That's some classic Brit
spy bullshit if ever I saw it.

28:47.000 --> 28:47.120
That's some classic Brit
spy bullshit if ever I saw it.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.680
Oh, do please fuck off, Miles.

28:49.720 --> 28:52.800
You know, the only thing worse
than...

28:52.840 --> 28:54.240
simple-minded and pompous is...

28:54.280 --> 28:56.280
Now, Kim, come on,
we're all friends here!

28:56.320 --> 28:58.160
..simple-minded,
pompous and American...

28:58.200 --> 29:00.280
Come on, come on, let's get you
some of that fresh air.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.280
Kim.

29:27.440 --> 29:30.040
Right.
Come on.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.040
Left-hand drawer of the desk.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.280
And that was it.

30:38.800 --> 30:42.240
He rejoined the others,
and I left the party to go

30:42.280 --> 30:44.520
and file my report at the consulate.

30:46.920 --> 30:47.000
That's the last you saw of him?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
That's the last you saw of him?

30:51.120 --> 30:52.240
Yes.

31:00.680 --> 31:03.440
Mr Elliott and I are going to go
and stretch our legs for a while.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.800
We'll reconvene back here
after lunch.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.000
'Mr Director, gentlemen...

31:40.680 --> 31:43.320
'You've all heard me preach
for years now,

31:43.360 --> 31:46.280
'how the Russians are
far more sophisticated

31:46.320 --> 31:47.000
'and strategic than
we give them credit for.'

31:47.000 --> 31:49.960
'and strategic than
we give them credit for.'

31:51.560 --> 31:54.320
So now that my longheld suspicions

31:54.360 --> 31:59.240
about Harold Adrian Russell
Kim Philby have been confirmed,

31:59.280 --> 32:03.000
a man who rose...
almost to the very top

32:03.040 --> 32:06.080
of Great Britain's
Secret Intelligence Services...

32:07.480 --> 32:12.000
..we are duty-bound to recognise
that the patience and the discipline

32:12.040 --> 32:14.920
of the Russian intelligence services

32:14.960 --> 32:17.000
are never again
to be under-estimated.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.640
are never again
to be under-estimated.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.200
But...

32:29.280 --> 32:32.800
..if at times,
we have lacked the resolve

32:32.840 --> 32:36.160
and the imagination
to counter that threat...

32:36.200 --> 32:37.840
Thank you.

32:39.320 --> 32:44.320
..then our British friends,
to use their term, are in,

32:44.360 --> 32:47.000
to use our term, even deeper shit.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.320
to use our term, even deeper shit.

32:49.480 --> 32:53.000
And we must now face the fact that
if they have been penetrated

32:53.040 --> 32:56.640
to the level that
Kim Philby achieved over the course

32:56.680 --> 32:59.400
of a quarter of a fucking century...

33:01.000 --> 33:04.120
..then not only are there
other Communist agents

33:04.160 --> 33:07.080
among the senior ranks of
their national security apparatus...

33:08.520 --> 33:11.280
..but more importantly...

33:11.320 --> 33:16.000
we too at the CIA...
have also been penetrated.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.680
Watch out.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.640
People and their bloody animals.

33:36.760 --> 33:37.960
Blunt came to me.

33:39.440 --> 33:40.760
At the end of last week.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.840
You don't seem that surprised.

33:46.880 --> 33:47.000
Shrewd customer, is Sir Anthony.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.200
Shrewd customer, is Sir Anthony.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.200
He claims to have only worked
for Russian intelligence

33:56.240 --> 33:58.480
when we were allies during the war.

33:58.520 --> 33:59.720
That old chestnut.

34:02.880 --> 34:07.240
So the reason
he decided to come to me now...

34:07.280 --> 34:10.040
is so I can be best positioned
to protect Her Majesty.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.840
To hush it up, you mean?

34:14.960 --> 34:17.000
Then... this morning...

34:17.000 --> 34:18.760
Then... this morning...

34:20.080 --> 34:24.960
..he telephones...
in a terrible state...

34:25.000 --> 34:30.280
to inform me that Mr Angleton...
attempted to interrogate him

34:30.320 --> 34:35.080
at some... CIA safe house
in Buckinghamshire.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.720
Which you managed to stop...

34:42.760 --> 34:44.720
..before any more damage
could be done.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.000
Well, maybe the Queen'll give me
a knighthood one day.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.720
Well, maybe the Queen'll give me
a knighthood one day.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.760
Does Moscow know Tony's blown?

34:57.200 --> 34:59.040
Rise, Sir Nicholas.

35:01.640 --> 35:05.960
We have to assume...
Philby's told the KGB about that.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.760
Oh, I highly doubt that.

35:09.680 --> 35:14.000
If the KGB were ever to discover
that he gave me Blunt, he's dead.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Perhaps we should consider
leaking it, then.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.360
Perhaps we should consider
leaking it, then.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.080
What day is it today?

35:23.120 --> 35:27.080
Friday. You a steak and kidney pie
man, Sir Roger?

35:50.400 --> 35:55.960
What difference do you think...
men like Philby and Elliott...

35:56.000 --> 36:00.440
and the games they play...
actually make in the world?

36:02.440 --> 36:05.480
You mean like the one
you and Elliott are now playing

36:05.520 --> 36:07.240
against Sir Roger?

36:07.280 --> 36:09.320
LIFT DOORS OPEN

36:23.880 --> 36:27.800
Hello, Jim. How are you?
Richard.

36:27.840 --> 36:31.920
How long, would you say,
did you suspect Kim Philby?

36:31.960 --> 36:35.760
Was there
a specific moment or incident

36:35.800 --> 36:39.080
that... opened your eyes?

36:39.120 --> 36:40.360
It was cumulative.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.120
Behavioural.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.000
I've never known a man
want so desperately to be my friend.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.400
I've never known a man
want so desperately to be my friend.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.920
But you were never fooled by him?

36:56.240 --> 36:58.720
If I was fooled by anything,

36:58.760 --> 37:02.320
it was by my faith
in our British friends...

37:03.920 --> 37:07.200
..whom I didn't believe would ever
let him slip through their fingers.

37:09.440 --> 37:13.720
Are you referring to anyone
in particular, Jim?

37:17.400 --> 37:21.400
I'm referring to an entire
goddamn class of Englishmen.

37:22.600 --> 37:26.000
At the risk of sounding
like a Communist yourself.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.600
CHUCKLES

37:45.560 --> 37:46.960
So...

37:48.680 --> 37:50.760
..who else did he give you?

37:52.960 --> 37:54.040
Philby.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.560
Because the other thing
that didn't come back from Beirut

37:59.600 --> 38:01.400
was that list of names.

38:16.880 --> 38:17.000
Right now... probably as we speak...

38:17.000 --> 38:20.960
Right now... probably as we speak...

38:22.320 --> 38:24.800
..Jim Angleton is back at the CIA,

38:24.840 --> 38:27.320
getting ready
to tear the place apart...

38:29.560 --> 38:31.880
..in search for traitors,

38:31.920 --> 38:37.000
due to implications, insinuations
and outright disinformation

38:37.040 --> 38:39.400
that Philby has been planting
in his brain

38:39.440 --> 38:42.080
for the last quarter of a century.

38:44.040 --> 38:47.000
So when you ask...
who else he gave me,

38:47.000 --> 38:47.800
So when you ask...
who else he gave me,

38:47.840 --> 38:53.080
I think the question that it's
important that we... you and I...

38:53.120 --> 38:56.600
first ask ourselves is this...

38:57.720 --> 39:01.160
..are we here in London...

39:01.200 --> 39:03.920
ready to withstand
such a level of witch hunt...

39:03.960 --> 39:07.440
and take on
those kind of casualties?

39:07.480 --> 39:13.360
Because, thanks to Philby...
who among us is now safe?

39:15.320 --> 39:17.000
Which is why, if
you'll allow me to blow my trumpet

39:17.000 --> 39:18.120
Which is why, if
you'll allow me to blow my trumpet

39:18.160 --> 39:20.480
briefly for a second...

39:20.520 --> 39:24.760
I was precisely the right person
to go to Beirut.

39:26.920 --> 39:33.120
Because had it been anybody else,
who didn't know Philby as I do...

39:34.840 --> 39:37.440
..there's no telling
who they'd be accusing next.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.280
Shall we?

40:49.720 --> 40:51.360
CHATTERING

41:20.800 --> 41:22.720
Any other questions, Jane?

41:29.240 --> 41:31.640
Mrs Thomas?

41:31.680 --> 41:33.320
No, sir.

41:51.640 --> 41:56.160
You may fool others, but you
can't pull the wool over these eyes.

41:56.200 --> 41:59.000
You want to know
what he once told me about you?

42:00.680 --> 42:03.000
He said that at any given moment,

42:03.040 --> 42:06.680
you're far more switched on
than you let on.

42:09.920 --> 42:13.240
Which is what makes you
so dangerous.

42:17.800 --> 42:20.680
Tell me you'll make something
of all this...

42:23.000 --> 42:27.960
..that in the end, you were in fact
always one step ahead of him.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.400
HORN HOOTS

42:57.080 --> 42:59.240
DOOR OPENS

43:03.720 --> 43:06.520
LAUGHTER

43:06.560 --> 43:08.120
CHATTERING

43:10.880 --> 43:12.120
Read this.

43:17.240 --> 43:19.480
When did you get...
Just read it.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.280
"Dear Nick, I wonder..."
To yourself.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.760
"Dear Nick, I wonder
if this letter will surprise you.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.240
"Our last transactions
were so strange,

43:34.280 --> 43:37.320
"I can't help thinking that perhaps
you wanted me to do a fade..."

43:54.360 --> 43:56.840
As a matter of interest,
why would you show me this?

44:02.800 --> 44:04.760
"It is invariably with pleasure

44:04.800 --> 44:07.160
"that I remember
our meetings and talks.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.600
"I've often thought that
there are a number of questions

44:12.640 --> 44:13.000
"connected with the whole story
that might interest you,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.120
"connected with the whole story
that might interest you,

44:15.160 --> 44:18.600
"and it might be...
helpful all around

44:18.640 --> 44:21.880
"if we could get together to discuss
matters of mutual interest...

44:21.920 --> 44:24.720
"..to give ourselves the chance

44:24.760 --> 44:27.640
"to salvage a friendship
from all this mess...

44:27.680 --> 44:30.720
"because as you always said...

44:30.760 --> 44:34.160
"the true definition of friendship
is that your forgive your friends...

44:34.200 --> 44:35.720
"..their faults."

44:43.120 --> 44:45.240
He's asking you for a meeting.

45:03.640 --> 45:06.080
Unteroffizier, Gefreiter.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.800
IN GERMAN:

45:51.880 --> 45:55.040
IN GERMAN:

46:20.600 --> 46:23.320
You can't seriously be
considering...

46:23.360 --> 46:25.720
What exactly do you think
would happen at this meeting?

46:25.760 --> 46:28.680
What, he'd cross his heart and hope
to die that Hollis is the fifth man?

46:28.720 --> 46:30.800
Just to be crystal bloody clear,

46:30.840 --> 46:33.240
the reason to believe
that Sir Roger is innocent

46:33.280 --> 46:36.160
is Philby is the de facto source
of the information against him.

46:36.200 --> 46:40.160
And you decided not to believe him,
so what's changed?

46:42.320 --> 46:43.000
Or maybe you think that
Philby will admit that

46:43.000 --> 46:44.920
Or maybe you think that
Philby will admit that

46:44.960 --> 46:46.920
he's secretly still one of you...

46:50.520 --> 46:52.560
..cos he was always one of you...

46:53.680 --> 46:54.720
..old chap.

47:13.800 --> 47:15.800
You're your own worst enemy.

47:19.880 --> 47:23.480
Do you know what's worse?
You're my worst enemy.

47:24.640 --> 47:27.080
You're the whole bloody country's
worst enemy.

47:27.120 --> 47:30.200
The man, he has fucking lied to you

47:30.240 --> 47:33.800
from the first moment
that he set eyes on you.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.960
He has lied to you
and he has used you.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.320
That is all that he has ever done,

47:40.360 --> 47:42.160
and that is all that
he will ever do.

47:43.880 --> 47:46.400
What's more, I'm not convinced that
you haven't known that

47:46.440 --> 47:47.880
for the last 23 years.

47:49.840 --> 47:55.720
When are you gonna fucking accept
that... and be honest with yourself?

48:10.360 --> 48:11.880
Ein frischer Wodka.

48:20.520 --> 48:24.720
MUSIC ON STEREO

50:24.880 --> 50:27.160
I hear you're leaving MI5.

50:27.200 --> 50:30.000
Oh, she told you, then, did she,
Mrs Sissmore?

50:30.040 --> 50:33.200
Something about
you wanting to be a better wife.

50:37.760 --> 50:41.080
Look, I... didn't let him go,

50:41.120 --> 50:43.000
or escape...
or however you put it.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.280
or escape...
or however you put it.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.160
What I, in fact, did was...

50:48.200 --> 50:50.080
Ooh, I like-a the look
of your salami!

50:50.120 --> 50:53.000
Whole or sliced, sir?

50:53.040 --> 50:56.800
ALL: What do I look-a like,
a bloody money box?

50:56.840 --> 50:59.160
LAUGHTER
You forced him to run.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.560
They'll never be able
to fully trust him in Moscow.

51:06.840 --> 51:08.640
Which will kill him.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.240
I'm sorry.

51:25.480 --> 51:27.000
Thank you.

51:32.560 --> 51:33.880
Right!

51:35.800 --> 51:36.960
Well, then, on that note...

51:40.720 --> 51:43.000
Why do you think Jane Sissmore

51:43.000 --> 51:43.240
Why do you think Jane Sissmore

51:43.280 --> 51:47.880
felt it necessary to tell me
you were resigning?

51:47.920 --> 51:50.280
I dunno.
Really?

51:50.320 --> 51:54.240
SHE LAUGHS
Erm...

51:54.280 --> 51:58.880
Apparently, according to her,
erm... I intrigue you.

52:02.600 --> 52:05.880
Are you really prepared to walk away
and let chaps like me

52:05.920 --> 52:10.040
continue running things, knowing
what you now know... about us all?

52:11.920 --> 52:13.000
You seriously think someone like me

52:13.000 --> 52:14.360
You seriously think someone like me

52:14.400 --> 52:16.760
could actually change things?
Things?

52:21.040 --> 52:23.160
Chaps like you.

52:24.840 --> 52:28.640
A woman... from Newcastle...
change us?

52:37.920 --> 52:39.280
Durham.

52:48.920 --> 52:52.960

53:41.440 --> 53:43.000
It's these offices at
the south east corner on this floor,

53:43.000 --> 53:44.720
It's these offices at
the south east corner on this floor,

53:44.760 --> 53:46.720
down that way, next to the vaults.

53:46.760 --> 53:51.240
All the other offices are organised
on separate floors...

53:51.280 --> 53:54.480
according to areas
of responsibility around the world.

53:54.520 --> 53:57.600
The remainder of the Iron Curtain,
south east Asia,

53:57.640 --> 54:00.800
Africa, central Europe.

54:00.840 --> 54:03.840
And this... this is you.

54:05.640 --> 54:09.640
Oh, damn!
SHE LAUGHS

54:09.680 --> 54:11.440
You've gotta laugh.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.680
Thank you.

No, I should be singing
Are You Lonesome Tonight?!

Cos you've got the sideboards,
you're the star!

56:20.200 --> 56:21.920
I'm all down to here. Yeah.
Yeah.

56:21.960 --> 56:24.400
It was the start,
something went wrong with the start.

56:24.440 --> 56:26.480
I know. Sid, you start us off,
will you?

56:26.520 --> 56:30.040
