<i>of</i> The Golden Girls...

00:44.667 --> 00:46.734
I'm sorry, Mrs. Petrillo.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.367
I have no choice
but to bring you in

00:48.433 --> 00:50.667
on a charge
of negligent arson.

00:50.734 --> 00:53.367
My mother is 85.
Surely, you make--

00:53.433 --> 00:56.400
I'm sorry. The law
recognizes no age limits.

00:56.467 --> 00:58.166
Mrs. Petrillo...

00:58.233 --> 00:59.667
you're under arrest.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.834
Ma, they can't prove

01:02.900 --> 01:05.333
that you started
that fire at Shady Pines.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.767
You are not
going to jail.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.133
You can't be sure of that,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.934
so I'm doing
what I have to do.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.600
I'm jumping bail
and moving back to Sicily.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.467
(tranquil music playing)

01:46.400 --> 01:48.100
Oh, hi, Ma.
How was your nap?

01:48.166 --> 01:49.867
I didn't take a nap.

01:49.934 --> 01:51.433
I'm a nervous wreck.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.233
How could I sleep
with this prison thing

01:53.300 --> 01:55.100
hanging over my head?

01:55.166 --> 01:56.300
Let's grab lunch.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.166
Ma, it's dinnertime.

01:58.233 --> 02:00.767
Oh, I guess
I did take a nap.

02:00.834 --> 02:02.767
I don't know
why you're nervous.

02:02.834 --> 02:05.400
You are not
going to prison.

02:05.467 --> 02:07.266
I feel like
I am in prison

02:07.333 --> 02:09.266
with you constantly
watching me.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.533
Are you going
to keep doing that?

02:11.600 --> 02:14.300
No, only until you forget
this ridiculous idea

02:14.367 --> 02:16.300
about leaving the country.

02:16.367 --> 02:17.800
I'm not skipping bail,
pussycat.

02:17.867 --> 02:19.133
I'd never make it.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.400
Every cabdriver,
waitress, and skycap

02:21.467 --> 02:22.367
between here and Sicily

02:22.433 --> 02:24.467
would eagerly talk to the police.

02:24.533 --> 02:25.934
Why do you say that?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.200
I undertip.

02:28.266 --> 02:30.633
Ma, I know
you're nervous,

02:30.700 --> 02:33.066
but Herb is a brilliant lawyer,

02:33.133 --> 02:36.100
and you have all
our love and support.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.266
You need anything
from the kitchen?

02:38.333 --> 02:41.367
Just bread and water.
Maybe I'll acquire a taste.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.066
How's Sophia?

02:57.133 --> 03:00.000
Well, she's over that
crazy idea about Sicily,

03:00.066 --> 03:03.500
but she's still very concerned
about going to jail.

03:03.567 --> 03:07.200
Who wouldn't be?
It's a terrifying prospect.

03:07.266 --> 03:09.834
Prison... the coldness of it,

03:09.900 --> 03:11.333
the steel bars,

03:11.400 --> 03:14.633
the wedges of cheese
hanging overhead

03:14.700 --> 03:17.734
tantalizingly just out of reach.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.734
Let me guess.
St. Olaf county jail.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.033
And deli.

03:23.934 --> 03:26.734
We have to do everything
we can to help ma.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.500
We've got to put
our heads together

03:29.567 --> 03:33.533
and figure out for certain
how that fire got started.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.300
We can start by ruling out
the obvious.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.266
Does Sophia
have any friends

03:39.333 --> 03:43.500
who are or ever have been
circus fire-eaters?

03:43.567 --> 03:45.767
No.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.700
Would she like
to meet some?

03:49.300 --> 03:51.700
Dorothy, we'll get
to the bottom of this.

03:51.767 --> 03:55.200
Lord knows we've gotten
out of tight spots before.

03:55.266 --> 03:58.233
Who was it
who got us into that--

03:58.300 --> 04:00.700
Oh, just a minute.
Now I remember.

04:00.767 --> 04:02.633
It's worth a try.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.200
It's either we sing
or he sings.

04:05.266 --> 04:06.667

I'm not going out with him.
You go, Blanche.

05:39.233 --> 05:43.333
-What?
-I know you like him, so you go.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.000
Why, I couldn't.

05:45.066 --> 05:46.467
Of course she couldn't.

05:46.533 --> 05:49.200
You stay out of this, Dorothy.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.834
Why not? It's all over between us.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.233
He'll know that tonight.

05:54.300 --> 05:58.300
It's impossible. I'd feel like a...

05:58.367 --> 06:00.166
I'd feel like a...

06:00.233 --> 06:02.700
A back-stabbing slut?

06:07.934 --> 06:08.967
No.

06:10.266 --> 06:12.633
Then please go, for me.

06:12.700 --> 06:16.233
I'll feel better knowing this thing
is finally over with.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.266
Well, since you
put it that way--

06:19.333 --> 06:22.567
but only as a personal
favor to you, honey.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.734
I guess
I better get dressed.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.834
Thank you, Blanche.

06:28.633 --> 06:31.200
Can you believe
that back-stabbing slut?

06:35.166 --> 06:38.000
Well, now that we know
we can work our way out of jams,

06:38.066 --> 06:41.233
how will we work out of this one?

06:41.300 --> 06:42.967
There's one thing
we could do--

06:43.033 --> 06:45.333
we could get something to eat.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.300
Can we concentrate?

06:47.367 --> 06:49.934
Seems like all we ever do is eat.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.066
Maybe it's all you ever do.

06:52.133 --> 06:54.133
Oh, excuse me.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.100
I forgot about all those
other appetites you satisfy

06:57.166 --> 06:59.667
before going
to the fridge.

07:00.467 --> 07:03.400
My life is more than just sex and food.

07:03.467 --> 07:05.300
I take care of this house.

07:05.367 --> 07:07.300
The other day
we had a leak,

07:07.367 --> 07:09.433
and the gas man came out.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.266
I guess that falls under sex.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.800
And you did fix him
a sandwich afterwards.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.000
Oh, yeah. I guess sex and food

07:21.066 --> 07:23.033
are a big part of our lives.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.233
In fact, just recently, last summer--

07:26.300 --> 07:28.166
or last spring--

07:28.233 --> 07:29.633
it's so hard to remember...

07:29.700 --> 07:31.767
Why does it have to be so hard?

07:31.834 --> 07:35.367
The hardest part for me
was explaining

07:35.433 --> 07:38.200
the difference between
boy's and girl's.

07:38.266 --> 07:41.934
I knew the time had come,
but I kept putting it off.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.333
Finally I decided it was time
to take the bull by the horns.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.400
So you told her?

07:46.467 --> 07:48.734
No, I took the bull by the horns,

07:48.800 --> 07:50.667
turned him around,
and showed her

07:50.734 --> 07:53.600
what makes a bull a bull.

07:54.934 --> 07:57.066
You are kidding, Rose.

07:57.133 --> 08:00.934
No. That's how my mother taught me.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.066
Honey, didn't that
give you a false impression

08:04.133 --> 08:06.667
about what a man would look like?

08:06.734 --> 08:09.567
It sure did.

08:09.633 --> 08:12.400
Can you imagine my surprise
on my wedding night

08:12.467 --> 08:13.367
with Charlie?

08:15.567 --> 08:18.467
Boy, that bull
would have been jealous.

08:24.934 --> 08:27.200
Rose, quite frankly, I don't get it.

08:27.266 --> 08:30.266
What is this hold buzz has over you?

08:30.333 --> 08:32.567
I know exactly what
she's going through.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.934
First love can be very powerful.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.467
I felt the same way
about Haywood Boyle,

08:37.533 --> 08:40.133
the star pitcher on our high school
baseball team,

08:40.200 --> 08:41.633
an amazing athlete.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.600
(gasps) That boy had exceptional control.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.300
He was always up
for extra innings.

08:58.934 --> 09:00.600
And his delivery--

09:00.667 --> 09:04.066
All right, Blanche, enough!

09:07.667 --> 09:10.000
Yeah. We get it.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.467
So, what was he like in bed?

09:15.934 --> 09:18.066
I'm going to have to agree with Blanche.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.767
Half the fun
is in getting there,

09:21.633 --> 09:24.900
and, boy, did your father and I have fun
trying for you.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.533
I don't think I want to hear this.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.934
I was going to wait
till you're 60,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.300
but you can
handle it now.

09:34.033 --> 09:35.500
We lived in New York.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.700
There was the
San Gennaro festival every year.

09:37.767 --> 09:38.834
Your father--

09:38.900 --> 09:42.633
may he rest in peace
until I get there--

09:42.700 --> 09:45.667
got so turned on by the festivities,

09:45.734 --> 09:48.300
he couldn't wait till we got home,

09:49.133 --> 09:51.200
so he took me right there

09:51.266 --> 09:53.600
behind the sausage and pepper stands.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.100
Hey, we were behind
the garbage cans.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.367
It's not like we were
in front of everybody.

10:06.767 --> 10:09.800
I can relate to the festivities part,
Sophia.

10:09.867 --> 10:14.867
All our children were conceived
on special St. Olaf holidays.

10:14.934 --> 10:17.800
Adam was conceived
on the day of the princess pig

10:17.867 --> 10:19.800
when they had
the pig crowning,

10:19.867 --> 10:22.700
and Jeanella was conceived
on Hay Day.

10:22.767 --> 10:26.000
That's the day we St. Olafians
celebrate hay.

10:27.233 --> 10:29.767
Rose, do you think
you could wrap this up

10:29.834 --> 10:32.300
before Rebecca goes into labor?

10:32.367 --> 10:33.934
Then there was
the day of the wheat

10:34.033 --> 10:37.600
when everybody
dressed as sandwiches.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.400
Charlie and I forgot
to put cheese between us,

10:42.467 --> 10:45.433
and before I knew it,
there was Kirsten.

10:50.633 --> 10:53.433
Blanche, what Rebecca is doing

10:53.500 --> 10:55.133
is really not so terrible.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.834
Look, among us four,

10:56.900 --> 10:58.967
each of us conceived our children

10:59.033 --> 11:00.333
in a different way.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.133
I was totally unconscious.

11:04.033 --> 11:06.066
When I came to, there was Stan,

11:06.133 --> 11:08.266
carving a notch in his dashboard.

11:12.867 --> 11:14.967
I never bought that
unconscious story.

11:15.033 --> 11:17.133
I swear. He must have
slipped me something.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.433
Apparently.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.266
Those stories made me hungry.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.100
They made me horny.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.900
I tell you what...
let's call the pizza guy.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.834
See, we both win.

11:34.900 --> 11:38.166
(telephone rings)

11:38.233 --> 11:39.500
Hello.

11:39.567 --> 11:40.800
What?

11:41.967 --> 11:43.533
Oh, my God!

11:43.600 --> 11:45.133
Ma's at the airport.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.700
They caught her trying to buy a ticket

11:46.767 --> 11:48.100
out of the country.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.567
(tranquil music playing)

11:57.066 --> 11:59.100
Can you believe ma,

11:59.166 --> 12:02.533
trying to go to Sicily
on my credit card?

12:02.600 --> 12:03.900
She would have made it

12:03.967 --> 12:06.700
if her chef's knife hadn't
shown up on the scanner.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.300
You want to know something crazy?

12:11.367 --> 12:13.967
I actually feel responsible for this.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.767
If I'd never checked her
into Shady Pines,

12:16.834 --> 12:18.567
she wouldn't have made
those s'mores,

12:18.633 --> 12:21.467
there wouldn't have been a fire,
and this wouldn't have happened.

12:21.533 --> 12:25.200
Looking at it like that,
you are responsible.

12:27.066 --> 12:29.867
I never had thought about it that way.

12:29.934 --> 12:31.400
It's like they're trying
the wrong person.

12:31.467 --> 12:33.800
It is your fault.

12:33.867 --> 12:36.100
Wait a second, girls.

12:36.166 --> 12:40.100
Can you imagine being the one
to put your mother in jail?

12:40.166 --> 12:41.834
It was just a theory.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.767
Follow that lady to guilt city.

12:43.834 --> 12:47.300
Now, stop it. Nobody's to blame for this.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.800
She's rationalizing.

12:49.867 --> 12:52.033
Instead of pointing fingers,

12:52.100 --> 12:54.567
we were going to find
a way out of this.

12:54.633 --> 12:57.166
We're certainly in the right place
for it.

12:57.233 --> 12:59.633
The kitchen... crisis central.

12:59.700 --> 13:03.667
(laughs) We sure have solved
a lot of problems here--

13:03.734 --> 13:05.367
I mean a lot.

13:05.433 --> 13:08.133
Dorothy, it wasn't
that long ago that you...

13:08.200 --> 13:11.500
It's you. I thought maybe Sophia
had come home.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.433
She'll be back in the morning.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.600
She's trying to teach me a lesson.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.033
I know my mother.

13:17.100 --> 13:21.300
Oh, really?
You said she wouldn't leave.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.834
You know, Dorothy, it's not
just your mother who left,

13:23.900 --> 13:27.700
-I feel like she's my mother too.
-I know. Don't worry, she'll be back.

13:27.767 --> 13:30.133
Now that she's gone,
who am I going to go to

13:30.200 --> 13:33.767
in the middle of the night with
my deepest personal problems?

13:33.834 --> 13:35.066
Wait a minute.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.834
You went to my mother's room
in the middle of the night?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.100
Many, many times.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.000
Two, three times a week.

13:41.066 --> 13:44.266
She was always so kind
and comforting.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.633
I don't understand,

13:45.700 --> 13:48.600
every time I knocked
on her door she'd say,

13:48.667 --> 13:52.467
"Not now, I'm watching Bob Costas."

13:52.533 --> 13:54.467
Sophia doesn't have
a TV in her room.

13:54.533 --> 13:55.934
I know.

13:59.133 --> 14:02.333
Then after we talked she always gave me
a piece of hard candy

14:02.400 --> 14:04.266
and a kiss goodnight.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.300
I can't sleep.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.867
And what's worse,
I went to Sophia's room

14:10.934 --> 14:12.333
for one of our talks,

14:14.900 --> 14:18.300
and then I remembered she left,
thanks to you.

14:18.367 --> 14:20.633
You had late night talks
with my mother?

14:20.700 --> 14:21.700
All the time.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.300
And she gave you hard candy?

14:23.367 --> 14:27.700
No. I'd ask, but she was always
afraid I'd choke on it.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.834
Why didn't somebody tell me
it was dinnertime?

14:33.200 --> 14:34.400
Ma, it's not dinner.

14:34.467 --> 14:35.567
It's the middle of the night.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.800
Good. Then I'm dressed for it.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.467
Blanche is upset.

14:41.533 --> 14:44.200
You would be, too,
if your daughter--

14:44.266 --> 14:45.467
I can't even say it.

14:45.533 --> 14:46.633
What could have happened?

14:46.700 --> 14:49.166
You two were getting so close.

14:49.934 --> 14:53.367
My little girl is going to have a baby
by artificial insemination.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.333
I just can't bear
to think about it.

15:07.367 --> 15:08.967
I'm just being silly, aren't I?

15:13.700 --> 15:16.300
For God's sake,
somebody say something.

15:16.367 --> 15:18.000
Ooh!

15:20.367 --> 15:21.800
Big help.

15:23.133 --> 15:26.200
Dorothy, what about you? You're always
the sensible one around here,

15:26.266 --> 15:28.834
the free, modern thinker.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.133
What do you think?

15:31.500 --> 15:32.967
Ooh!

15:35.233 --> 15:37.033
Dorothy, maybe we should all
get some rest

15:37.100 --> 15:39.633
and try to help Sophia tomorrow.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.000
Yeah. You're probably right.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.100
Dorothy, can we look in
on Sophia, too?

15:44.166 --> 15:46.100
She is like a mother to us.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.767
I think she'd like that.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.133
Here's the key.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.633
I'm planning what we should do
if they send Sophia off.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.100
What, appeal?

15:58.166 --> 16:01.633
No. A party. A prison party.

16:03.433 --> 16:07.033
I listed the men we should invite,
and we'll be the judges.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.734
"I sentence you to 10 minutes
with me on the lanai."

16:11.533 --> 16:14.166
(Blanche) Some can be convicts,
some can be guards.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.567
What are you looking at?

16:17.767 --> 16:19.567
I just cannot believe

16:19.633 --> 16:22.300
how much you think about men.

16:22.367 --> 16:26.600
Men are an important
part of my life... not just my life.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.900
They're an important part
of all our lives.

16:28.967 --> 16:33.166
Hardly a day goes by here there's not
an incident about some man

16:33.233 --> 16:35.300
that we're dating, used to date,

16:35.367 --> 16:36.834
or want to date.

16:36.900 --> 16:39.967
I'm going out with my friends.
Can you give me some money?

16:40.033 --> 16:42.333
Where's the money
I gave you last night?

16:42.400 --> 16:45.700
Let's see. 10 bucks went
for cover charge,

16:45.767 --> 16:48.166
10 bucks went for
a round of drinks,

16:48.233 --> 16:50.133
and the other 10 went into the G-string

16:50.200 --> 16:53.734
of a very cute male dancer
named Mr. Big.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.100
I know that guy.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.200
That's just a stage name.

17:06.967 --> 17:10.100
Ted, did I hear someone say
you were a doctor?

17:10.166 --> 17:11.934
He's not just a doctor.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.767
He's one of the top neurosurgeons
in the Midwest.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.266
Get out of here.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.467
He's also heavy into real estate.

17:17.533 --> 17:20.433
I just own a few mini-malls.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.166
Your wife must be
very proud of you.

17:23.233 --> 17:24.767
Actually, we're divorced.

17:24.834 --> 17:27.900
Oh, I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

17:39.700 --> 17:40.734
Hello, girls.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.734
Dorothy, Rose, y'all remember Lazlo.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.200
Of course. Lazlo the artist
from your museum.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.233
Oh, we really enjoyed your lecture
on modern sculpture.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.500
I didn't think anyone
was paying attention.

17:51.567 --> 17:54.533
We sure were, especially Dorothy.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.433
She even talked about
taking up sculpting.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.100
-Really?
-Oh, no, I didn't.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.633
Yes, you did.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.567
You said you'd like to help him
mold his clay

18:02.633 --> 18:04.867
or buff his marble anytime.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.500
Rose, you're such a kidder.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.500
What is sex, after all?

18:16.567 --> 18:18.367
Two clunky old bodies

18:18.433 --> 18:20.800
thrashing around
against each other...

18:22.400 --> 18:24.600
like animals.

18:24.667 --> 18:28.467
You get all sweaty and flushed.

18:28.533 --> 18:30.800
Your hair gets mussed.

18:30.867 --> 18:33.033
You lose your breath.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.967
You lose your earrings.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.200
Your mouth waters.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.600
Your nose runs.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.433
Your heart races.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.100
Your blood races.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.633
-Rose--
-Say it, Ernie.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.567
It's time, Rose.

18:48.633 --> 18:50.967
Check! Please!

18:54.767 --> 18:57.033
I'm not saying
I want her to go to prison,

18:57.100 --> 18:58.900
but if she goes,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.667
we have the theme
for the party.

19:03.734 --> 19:07.166
Girls, do I have news for you.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.667
Rose, where have you been?

19:08.734 --> 19:10.333
Trying to reach the fire inspector

19:10.400 --> 19:12.533
who inspected Shady Pines,

19:12.600 --> 19:15.633
to double-check there wasn't anything
wrong with the building.

19:15.700 --> 19:16.567
And?

19:16.633 --> 19:18.834
And get this--

19:18.900 --> 19:20.700
they said the inspector quit

19:20.767 --> 19:23.433
three days after the Shady Pines fire.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.333
He mysteriously
came into some money,

19:26.400 --> 19:28.934
then moved to an exclusive
Palm Beach neighborhood.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.467
You know what that means?

19:30.533 --> 19:33.433
Rose, of course
I know what this means.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.600
Then will you explain it to me?

19:35.667 --> 19:37.200
It all sounded suspicious,

19:37.266 --> 19:39.834
but I couldn't quite
piece it together.

19:40.967 --> 19:42.300
Rose, you nitwit,

19:42.367 --> 19:44.567
the guy was probably
on the take.

19:44.633 --> 19:47.800
I told you everything
would be fine.

19:47.867 --> 19:50.867
Hey, I have an idea.

19:50.934 --> 19:53.300
Let's have a getting out
of prison party.

19:53.367 --> 19:55.000
Everybody can pretend

19:55.066 --> 19:57.066
they've been locked up
for about three years.

19:57.133 --> 19:59.200
They have all this
pent-up sexual energy.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.734
Everybody's all pumped up

20:00.800 --> 20:03.100
because all you do
in prison is lift weights.

20:03.166 --> 20:06.533
We'll get all those muscle guys
with homemade tattoos.

20:07.133 --> 20:08.800
What are you looking at?

20:13.867 --> 20:17.800
You did a good job, ladies,
but there still has to be a trial.

20:17.867 --> 20:20.667
Mrs. Heartgrove's confession
is pretty strong.

20:20.734 --> 20:24.300
I just wish we had something
that reflected on her credibility.

20:24.367 --> 20:29.367
What about a video of her and her friend
mooning a hot dog vendor?

20:29.433 --> 20:31.967
That would totally discredit her.

20:32.033 --> 20:34.834
Wait. I just remembered
who the friend was.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.133
Can't use it. Moving on.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.900
(gasps) If you think of anything else,
give me a call.

20:40.967 --> 20:44.033
I have to be at the courthouse
at quarter to 3:00.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.066
<i>♪ There's no one in the place ♪</i>

20:46.133 --> 20:48.100
<i>♪ Except you and me ♪</i>

20:49.433 --> 20:52.166
<i>That's what we were singing</i>
<i>that night.</i>

20:52.233 --> 20:54.367
We were drinking Nyquil shooters

20:54.433 --> 20:57.266
and singing "One For My Baby."

20:57.333 --> 20:58.734
I remember.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.667
Ma, you do?

21:00.734 --> 21:04.166
Yeah. I heard a smoke alarm,
looked up,

21:04.233 --> 21:06.333
and saw flames
coming out of the heater.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.767
I grabbed maria and the hot plate
and ran out.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.800
-It was the heater.
-You're sure?

21:12.867 --> 21:14.800
Sure, it was the heater.

21:14.867 --> 21:17.600
Find that hot plate,
we'll go to the D.A.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.533
There's enough evidence
to get these charges dropped.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.533
Ma, I am so proud of you.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.333
Now, if you could
just remember

21:24.400 --> 21:27.166
where you left the hot plate.

21:27.233 --> 21:29.133
I used it recently.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.166
Think, Sophia, think.

21:31.233 --> 21:33.233
What's that smell?

21:33.300 --> 21:34.600
(beeping)

21:34.667 --> 21:37.300
My God, that's the smoke alarm
in Sophia's room.

21:37.367 --> 21:38.533
Oh, no!

21:39.700 --> 21:42.800
Oh, yeah. Anyone for s'mores?

21:49.233 --> 21:52.433
Well, Sophia, how's it feel to be home?

21:52.500 --> 21:54.433
I feel like a free man.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.767
You didn't actually go to jail.

21:56.834 --> 21:58.467
Okay, forget the free part.

21:58.533 --> 21:59.734
I feel like a man.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.500
I missed two estrogen shots,

22:01.567 --> 22:03.500
and I'm dying for a thick steak,

22:03.567 --> 22:06.200
a tall cold one,
and going out and picking up--

22:06.266 --> 22:07.533
Ma!

22:08.433 --> 22:10.934
-Can I tell you something, pussycat?
-What?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.734
I've never been so scared...

22:13.800 --> 22:15.900
not so much of jail.

22:15.967 --> 22:18.200
It was not being here
with all of you,

22:18.266 --> 22:21.667
only seeing you 10 minutes
on visitor's day.

22:21.734 --> 22:24.100
That's not enough time
for a St. Olaf story

22:24.166 --> 22:25.333
to get off the runway.

22:26.533 --> 22:31.033
All I'm saying is, maybe you're not much,
but you're all I've got.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.667
Am I crying, pussycat?

22:32.734 --> 22:33.900
No, Ma.

22:34.834 --> 22:37.567
I guess it wasn't
as touching as I thought.

22:37.633 --> 22:41.166
Oh, Ma, I'm just glad
everything worked out.

22:41.233 --> 22:44.367
I never want to have to
go through that again.

22:44.433 --> 22:46.934
I knew it would all be okay.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.333
Rose, you deserve
a lot of the credit.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.500
You double-checked
on that fire inspector.

22:52.567 --> 22:55.033
Yes. I'm proud of you, Rose.

22:55.100 --> 22:58.633
You make it sound
like it's the only smart thing I ever did.

22:58.700 --> 23:01.867
I've done a lot of smart things
over the years.

23:01.934 --> 23:03.367
Remember?

23:18.200 --> 23:22.967
(theme music playing)
