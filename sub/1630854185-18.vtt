I own the Lucky Stakes.

09:38.482 --> 09:41.275
The casino across the street.

09:41.379 --> 09:42.896
Shandara's a pit boss there.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.103
My best.

09:44.206 --> 09:45.517
So you were working
Bart's party?

09:45.620 --> 09:46.620
At the Cyan?

09:46.724 --> 09:47.965
Mr. Cicero was kind enough

09:48.068 --> 09:49.482
to let a lot of us
have the night off.

09:49.586 --> 09:51.068
Well, I feel sorry
about that now.

09:51.172 --> 09:53.931
You were loaning
employees and partying

09:54.034 --> 09:55.931
with a competitor?I didn't see it like that.

09:56.034 --> 09:57.793
Bart did a lot for this town,

09:57.896 --> 09:59.103
and his new casino here

09:59.206 --> 10:02.310
was gonna drive more business
to the region.

10:02.413 --> 10:04.206
Forget about the damn tortoises.

10:04.310 --> 10:08.275
That's what I call
a symbiotic ecosystem.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Well, if you're willing to
help, we might need access

10:12.103 --> 10:14.310
to your exterior cameras.Anything.

10:14.413 --> 10:15.379
Call me.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.758
RAJAN:
What's your name?

10:16.862 --> 10:19.068
Rhonda Alvarez.

10:19.172 --> 10:20.827
You're dressed
pretty casually

10:20.931 --> 10:22.103
for a masquerade party.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.275
Any chance you
were protesting?

10:24.379 --> 10:25.655
You have my name.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.862
You'll find out
on all the police reports

10:26.965 --> 10:28.103
we filed against Clint Farley.

10:28.206 --> 10:29.862
You can read
about his harassment,

10:29.965 --> 10:32.655
how he'd run over our tents,
roll coal at us.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.689
How did you get into the party?

10:34.793 --> 10:37.275
You were obviously
close to the blast.

10:38.758 --> 10:40.517
I didn't do this.[scoffs]

10:40.620 --> 10:41.793
I didn't.

10:41.896 --> 10:43.275
But if he's dead,
it's a blessing.

10:43.379 --> 10:46.827
That man was willing to kill
an entire species for cash.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.586
The world is a better place
without him.

10:53.137 --> 10:54.517
Excuse me.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.137
Hi. I'm-I'm Haley Flynn.

10:56.241 --> 10:57.724
Bart Flynn's daughter.

10:57.827 --> 10:59.586
Can I see him?

11:06.551 --> 11:08.689
I'm so sorry.

11:09.655 --> 11:11.862
Oh, my God.

11:15.551 --> 11:17.344
I was supposed to be there.

11:17.448 --> 11:19.793
He wanted me there

11:19.896 --> 11:22.241
to blow on the dice while...

11:22.344 --> 11:23.689
he dealt craps to, um...

11:23.793 --> 11:25.551
Haley, it's-it's...

11:25.655 --> 11:27.655
Oh, my God.

11:27.758 --> 11:29.862
Can you think of
anyone who might...

11:29.965 --> 11:32.275
Anyone who might
want to kill my dad?

11:32.379 --> 11:35.206
Hurt him, um,
or-or his family.

11:35.310 --> 11:37.310
Or his business.

11:37.413 --> 11:40.965
His business is people.
That's what he always says.

11:42.896 --> 11:44.344
And if he were here...

11:45.793 --> 11:47.689
...he'd be helping.

11:47.793 --> 11:50.275
He'd want me to help.

12:02.586 --> 12:04.344
Trey. What's going on?

12:04.448 --> 12:05.448
Oh, bro.

12:05.551 --> 12:07.206
Where's Jeanette?

12:08.275 --> 12:10.586
You're filthy, Fols.
You couldn't shower

12:10.689 --> 12:12.103
before coming over?

12:13.862 --> 12:14.896
She isn't here, is she?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.482
You pulled me off
a bomb site.

12:16.586 --> 12:18.689
This isn't about my mom
at all, is it?

12:18.793 --> 12:20.586
Yo, yo, Jeanette raised me,
too, dude, all right?

12:20.689 --> 12:22.310
Listen, it's the only way
I could get you to answer.

12:22.413 --> 12:26.068
Listen, I really
need your help, okay?

12:27.103 --> 12:28.310
There's this-this deadbeat,

12:28.413 --> 12:30.000
old friend of mine,
pain in my ass.

12:30.103 --> 12:33.517
Just... trying to shake him,
but some people, you know?

12:33.620 --> 12:34.620
Yeah. Yeah.

12:34.724 --> 12:36.103
I get it.

12:36.206 --> 12:37.655
Well, he came around last night,

12:37.758 --> 12:38.724
broke into my apartment.

12:38.827 --> 12:40.068
So call 911, Trey.

12:40.172 --> 12:41.689
Yeah, I don't need
that kind of heat, okay?

12:41.793 --> 12:42.689
He's bad news.

12:42.793 --> 12:44.448
Will you just... will you...

12:44.551 --> 12:46.275
will you take a look?

12:49.655 --> 12:51.000
Come on.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.517
[door closes]

12:57.620 --> 12:59.068
Trey.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.689
You killed the guy?No, no, man.

13:03.793 --> 13:05.620
It's not like that.You've been calling me
for hours, man.

13:05.724 --> 13:07.827
You've been playing house
with a dead body all morning?

13:07.931 --> 13:09.241
What else were we
supposed to do?

13:09.344 --> 13:10.689
He was like this
when we got home,

13:10.793 --> 13:11.827
and I don't know how he got in.

13:11.931 --> 13:13.206
He wasn't here when we left.

13:13.310 --> 13:15.827
So you're saying
he-he broke in and OD'd?

13:15.931 --> 13:18.034
Okay, I know it looks bad.

13:18.137 --> 13:19.586
Why do you think I called?

13:19.689 --> 13:21.896
Wait, what are you doing?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.344
What you should have done
hours ago.

13:25.241 --> 13:27.827
I got a 419, a possible OD

13:27.931 --> 13:29.000
at 7119 Eaton ParkwayHey, what is he doing?

13:29.103 --> 13:30.482
in West Vegas.

13:30.586 --> 13:33.172
Reinforcements are here.

13:33.275 --> 13:35.931
It's about time
you came to see me.

13:36.034 --> 13:38.793
Welcome back.Shouldn't that be my line?

13:38.896 --> 13:41.275
Un-retiring agrees with you.

13:41.379 --> 13:42.586
ROBY:
All right, everybody, listen up.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.931
The bomb
is the whole story here.

13:44.034 --> 13:45.034
We find every piece.

13:45.137 --> 13:46.862
We rebuild them.
We find our guy.

13:46.965 --> 13:48.517
WILLOWS:
Keep your head on a swivel

13:48.620 --> 13:50.172
and a fine tooth comb
in your hand.

13:50.275 --> 13:52.965
We collect, measure,
and swab everything.

13:53.068 --> 13:54.379
And I'll buy
drinks for anyone

13:54.482 --> 13:55.965
who finds something that
tells us how the bombs

13:56.068 --> 13:57.275
were triggered.
Oftentimes,

13:57.379 --> 13:58.758
that's the bomber's signature.

13:58.862 --> 14:01.000
Yep. We have
heard that.

14:01.103 --> 14:02.344
GILL:
So, we have a puzzle and

14:02.448 --> 14:04.137
a scavenger hunt
a-and maybe drinks.

14:04.241 --> 14:05.724
I'm in.[chuckles]

14:05.827 --> 14:07.000
ROBY:
I've got Beau and Allie

14:07.103 --> 14:08.793
on the construction site bombs.

14:08.896 --> 14:10.172
Everybody here,
we're on tent duty.

14:10.275 --> 14:12.172
Got to focus on
the deadly ones first.

14:12.275 --> 14:13.379
We sure it's safe
to go in there?

14:13.482 --> 14:14.827
Sergeant Wilcox.

14:14.931 --> 14:16.379
Yup.

14:17.896 --> 14:20.000
You and me, let's go.Ma'am.

14:23.034 --> 14:25.379
We rechecked the tent
and the perimeter.

14:26.793 --> 14:28.103
So, we're good now, right?

14:28.206 --> 14:31.103
WILCOX:
You're good.
No secondary device.

You didn't find any
smokeless powder at your scene?

15:21.172 --> 15:22.827
Everything here
was covered in it.

15:22.931 --> 15:24.103
No powder,
just propane.

15:24.206 --> 15:25.551
Got us thinking, I mean,

15:25.655 --> 15:27.275
propane tanks are common
at a construction site.

15:27.379 --> 15:29.275
They use it to fuel forklifts
and welding torches.

15:29.379 --> 15:31.000
We think some of the tanks
might have been caught

15:31.103 --> 15:32.586
in the second IED's blast,

15:32.689 --> 15:33.724
which would explain why

15:33.827 --> 15:34.793
we saw three
explosions.

15:34.896 --> 15:36.103
So, what kind of residue

15:36.206 --> 15:37.344
did the second IED leave?

15:37.448 --> 15:38.793
None.
Maybe the propane

15:38.896 --> 15:40.655
burned off the smokeless powder
over there.

15:40.758 --> 15:42.344
Maybe, might have, could have.

15:42.448 --> 15:44.551
Those words die in a GC/MS.

15:44.655 --> 15:46.379
Tell you what,
head back to the lab

15:46.482 --> 15:49.965
test all the shrapnel, find out
what kind of bomb it was.

15:50.068 --> 15:51.137
We've got it handled here.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.793
You know, most people

15:52.896 --> 15:54.517
assume elements of the bomb

15:54.620 --> 15:56.103
vaporize in the blast,

15:56.206 --> 15:58.482
but that's actually
highly unlikely.

15:58.586 --> 15:59.965
You don't say.

16:00.068 --> 16:02.655
Explosions only seem
unpredictable until we apply

16:02.758 --> 16:04.172
redux chemistry.

16:04.275 --> 16:07.344
Bomb 101. Totally.

16:07.448 --> 16:09.344
It's always good to review.

16:10.689 --> 16:13.655
WILLOWS:Don't you think it's strange
we didn't find any projectiles?

16:13.758 --> 16:17.000
There wasn't one nail or screw,
even at the construction site.

16:17.103 --> 16:18.551
Boosting a body count

16:18.655 --> 16:20.724
is usually number one
on a bomber's to-do list.

16:20.827 --> 16:22.241
ROBY:
I mean, maybe
they were absorbed.

16:22.344 --> 16:24.000
WILLOWS:
Maybe. I found pieces

16:24.103 --> 16:25.413
of a poker table
at the epicenter.

16:25.517 --> 16:26.862
If the IED

16:26.965 --> 16:28.172
was hidden underneath,

16:28.275 --> 16:29.793
it might have taken
the brunt of the impact.

16:29.896 --> 16:32.965
[whoops]
Heyo! Drinks on Greg.

16:33.068 --> 16:34.689
You find the receiver?

16:38.931 --> 16:40.310
This isn't the receiver.

16:40.413 --> 16:43.068
You found the
bomb's detonator.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.655
Shrapnel test number 15.

16:46.758 --> 16:48.000
More propane.

16:49.586 --> 16:51.137
[sighs, grunts]

16:51.241 --> 16:53.758
Got to be trace of an IED
in here somewhere.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.689
Um...

17:02.793 --> 17:04.689
could you hand me a swab?

17:05.827 --> 17:07.550
No fingerprints, no DNA.

17:07.655 --> 17:10.448
We're looking at one
careful bomber out there,

17:10.550 --> 17:11.862
or a lucky one.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.275
I don't understand who
would choose a key fob

17:14.378 --> 17:16.137
as a detonator.
The range is only about

17:16.241 --> 17:17.310
30 to 50 feet.

17:17.413 --> 17:19.241
The killer, he-he didn't...

17:19.344 --> 17:21.241
he-he didn't build
multiple bombs.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.792
There-there was no second bomb.

17:22.896 --> 17:24.413
Second blast was an accident,
just like the third

17:24.517 --> 17:25.550
and the fourth.
Th-There was no second bomb.

17:25.655 --> 17:26.655
Slow down, Beau.

17:26.758 --> 17:27.827
[sighs]

17:27.931 --> 17:29.275
Okay.

17:29.379 --> 17:31.724
I swabbed just about
every piece of shrapnel

17:31.827 --> 17:34.172
until I found this.

17:34.275 --> 17:37.689
It's the only projectile at the
second site that had a trace

17:37.793 --> 17:38.862
of smokeless powder.

17:38.965 --> 17:40.103
Look, look at it.

17:40.206 --> 17:41.551
Do you see how it's iridescent?

17:41.655 --> 17:44.241
Stainless steel turns iridescent
when put under

17:44.344 --> 17:45.862
a tremendous amount
of heat and pressure.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.103
That piece of metal was at
the center of the explosion.

17:48.206 --> 17:49.620
But you just said there was

17:49.724 --> 17:51.448
no bomb at the second scene.There wasn't.

17:51.551 --> 17:52.965
This is a piece of housing

17:53.068 --> 17:54.620
from the IED
set off at the party.

17:54.724 --> 17:55.620
In the tent.

17:55.724 --> 17:56.620
The first bomb.

17:56.724 --> 17:58.379
I-I think

17:58.482 --> 18:00.448
a piece of shrapnel
from the IED casing

18:00.551 --> 18:02.827
struck the propane tank,
causing it to leak.

18:02.931 --> 18:04.655
Because propane
is heavier than air,

18:04.758 --> 18:06.379
the vapor pools
were just waiting there

18:06.482 --> 18:08.655
for something as insignificant
as an ember from

18:08.758 --> 18:11.379
the first blast site
to ignite the blaze.

18:11.482 --> 18:14.103
So, the second blast was
an accident caused by shrapnel.

18:14.206 --> 18:15.931
Why haven't we found
any projectiles

18:16.034 --> 18:17.241
from that first IED?

18:17.344 --> 18:18.862
I mean, not a bolt,

18:18.965 --> 18:20.758
not a-not a ball bearing.

18:20.862 --> 18:24.793
I mean, it's almost like-like
the bomber was, like, try...

18:26.103 --> 18:28.586
Like he was trying
to minimize the body count.

18:29.862 --> 18:34.172
Only three dead.Why use a detonator

18:34.275 --> 18:36.413
with a smaller range unless

18:36.517 --> 18:38.620
you needed to see the blast?

18:39.724 --> 18:42.931
If there were not
multiple bombs,

18:43.034 --> 18:44.241
I don't think this
was intended to be

18:44.344 --> 18:45.724
a mass casualty event at all.

18:45.827 --> 18:48.448
You think the bomber had
a specific target in mind?

18:48.551 --> 18:50.862
And they waited
until that target

18:50.965 --> 18:52.862
was in just

18:52.965 --> 18:54.241
the right position.

18:54.344 --> 18:55.758
The killer was standing
right there in the tent.

18:56.551 --> 18:59.344
And they looked the victims
right in the eye

18:59.448 --> 19:01.413
when they pushed the button.

19:05.793 --> 19:07.655
Dental records confirm your
initial ID's on these guys.

19:09.137 --> 19:11.793
Bart Flynn. Clint Farley.

19:11.896 --> 19:13.689
Third is Dalton Gray.

19:13.793 --> 19:16.551
Gentleman worked on Bart Flynn's
personal security detail.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.724
All exhibit
a combination of

19:18.827 --> 19:22.206
pulmonary trauma from shrapnel
and blast-induced barotrauma.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.275
Barotrauma. A-As in...

19:24.379 --> 19:25.862
As in barometric.
Uh, barotrauma's

19:25.965 --> 19:27.517
when you're too close
to a blast wave

19:27.620 --> 19:29.103
that decompresses
the air around you.

19:29.206 --> 19:31.275
A sudden pressure
differential between

19:31.379 --> 19:32.965
the air around your body and the

19:33.068 --> 19:34.724
gas-containing internal organs,

19:34.827 --> 19:36.448
like the G.I. tract,
cause the organs to perforate,

19:36.551 --> 19:38.103
inducing massive hemorrhaging.

19:38.206 --> 19:39.793
I thought...

19:39.896 --> 19:42.689
you might want the shrapnel
from each of the victims.

19:42.793 --> 19:44.034
Mostly metal,

19:44.137 --> 19:45.275
but about a third of it's wood.

19:45.379 --> 19:47.310
Who knew a table
could do so much damage?

19:47.413 --> 19:48.413
You've never seen
a tornado victim, huh?

19:48.517 --> 19:50.000
Splinters at these

19:50.103 --> 19:51.620
velocities become bullets.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.413
We have every reason
to believe

19:53.517 --> 19:55.724
that one of these men
was the target

19:55.827 --> 19:58.000
of the IED.
Who got it the worst?

19:58.103 --> 19:59.344
Wow.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.241
It's hard to say.

20:01.344 --> 20:03.551
The symmetrical trauma
to the lower half

20:03.655 --> 20:05.517
tells me that they were
all equidistant

20:05.620 --> 20:07.206
and facing the bomb
when it detonated.

20:07.310 --> 20:10.103
None of these guys started off
with a spare foot, did they?

20:10.206 --> 20:11.827
We haven't heard
from the hospital.

20:11.931 --> 20:13.241
Can I just say that I hate

20:13.344 --> 20:15.793
when y'all bring me spare limbs?

20:15.896 --> 20:17.206
The paperwork is weird.

20:17.310 --> 20:18.862
[phone rings]Excuse me.

20:18.965 --> 20:20.758
Busy day.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.310
ROBY:
I know it's wrong,

20:24.413 --> 20:26.586
but I really wish
one of these guys

20:26.689 --> 20:28.275
was in worse shape
than the other.

20:28.379 --> 20:31.827
Oh, so you know
who was the target.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.724
Well, my money's on Clint.

20:33.827 --> 20:35.620
Allie said there was a protestor
in the triage tent.

20:35.724 --> 20:37.310
Hated Clint with a passion.

20:37.413 --> 20:39.448
We should talk to her again
because the detonator's range

20:39.551 --> 20:41.965
puts the bomber in the tent.

20:42.068 --> 20:43.137
In that case,

20:43.241 --> 20:45.241
maybe our guy lost five toes.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.172
ROBY:
I wonder if Detective Chavez

20:47.275 --> 20:51.000
has ever had to fit Cinderella
with a disembodied foot.

20:51.103 --> 20:53.103
[high-pitched ringing]

20:53.206 --> 20:54.586
[groans]

20:54.689 --> 20:56.103
[winces]

20:56.206 --> 20:57.896
[groans]

20:58.689 --> 21:02.137
Isn't this all kind of a waste
of time? Guy OD'd. There.

21:02.241 --> 21:03.724
Solved it.

21:03.827 --> 21:06.034
I got to get to work, man.Yeah,

21:06.137 --> 21:07.517
and I'm at work,
and my job is

21:07.620 --> 21:09.482
to thoroughly investigate
Richie's death.

21:10.896 --> 21:13.103
Uh, if you got places to go,
Trey, you're free to go.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.482
Stacey's good to go, too.

21:14.586 --> 21:18.034
All right, awesome.
Thanks, uh, Serena.

21:18.137 --> 21:19.620
Mm-hmm.

21:20.586 --> 21:23.655
Way more your vibe
than Allie, bro.

21:26.551 --> 21:27.724
Y-You know Allie?

21:27.827 --> 21:30.482
Yeah, Fols introduced us,
few months back.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.068
If that's news, my bad, bro.

21:35.172 --> 21:38.000
Yo, tell Allie I say what's up.

21:41.896 --> 21:43.310
[door opens]

21:44.551 --> 21:45.862
[door closes]

21:45.965 --> 21:47.379
I see why you keep that one
under wraps.

21:47.482 --> 21:49.862
I'm sorry I had to
introduce you today.

21:49.965 --> 21:51.275
It's fine.

21:51.379 --> 21:53.103
Something about
this scene I just

21:53.206 --> 21:54.275
don't like.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.068
Yeah.

21:56.172 --> 21:57.517
Me too.

21:57.620 --> 21:58.827
Yeah.

21:58.931 --> 22:01.758
See, I don't like
that you showed up here

22:01.862 --> 22:03.551
instead of going
to the hospital.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.379
I told you, I'm okay.

22:05.482 --> 22:07.896
All right?
A friend needed me.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.344
That's all.

22:16.137 --> 22:19.310
Have you seen my foot?
What does it look like?

22:19.413 --> 22:20.896
We are gonna do
everything we can

22:21.000 --> 22:22.517
to find out
who did this to you, mister...

22:22.620 --> 22:24.413
I'm non-binary.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.068
Van is fine.

22:26.172 --> 22:29.620
Van, the deceased are
Bart Flynn, Clint Farley,

22:29.724 --> 22:31.862
and Mr. Flynn's security
guard, Dalton Grey.

22:31.965 --> 22:33.482
ROBY:
We think that the bomb

22:33.586 --> 22:35.448
was specifically meant
to kill one of them.

22:35.551 --> 22:37.827
You were Clint's
site coordinator, correct?

22:37.931 --> 22:39.827
That's right.

22:39.931 --> 22:42.344
You don't seem too broken up
about his death.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.137
Yeah.

22:44.241 --> 22:45.344
I'm not.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.896
Clint sucked.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.827
He was hostile,

22:48.931 --> 22:51.689
he paid people late, created
unsafe work environments.

22:51.793 --> 22:53.068
You know, the only reason
he invited me

22:53.172 --> 22:55.413
to that party was to ream me out
in front of Bart.

22:55.517 --> 22:57.862
ROBY:
Right before the bomb went off.

22:57.965 --> 22:59.034
Walk us through it.

22:59.137 --> 23:01.000
Where were you, who'd you see?

23:01.103 --> 23:03.448
It was hard to tell
who was who. I mean,

23:03.551 --> 23:05.689
Everyone was wearing a mask.

23:05.793 --> 23:08.482
Clint put me in charge of
getting rid of the protestors.

23:08.586 --> 23:10.586
You know, it's like
he didn't understand you legally

23:10.689 --> 23:12.344
can't stop people
from protesting.

23:12.448 --> 23:14.620
Okay, so do you recall

23:14.724 --> 23:16.448
where Bart was standing?

23:16.551 --> 23:18.482
Sorry.

23:18.586 --> 23:20.034
It's all a fog.

23:21.310 --> 23:23.206
You remember everything

23:23.310 --> 23:25.896
except where Bart was standing
and what happened

23:26.000 --> 23:27.137
right before
the bomb went off.

23:27.241 --> 23:28.413
I'm a victim too, detective.

23:28.517 --> 23:31.413
And I'm in a lot of pain.

23:31.517 --> 23:34.413
Talking about this
isn't gonna help.

23:34.517 --> 23:37.103
GREG:
This is really cool.

23:37.206 --> 23:40.000
But unless I'm mistaken,
the killer's not in there.

23:40.103 --> 23:43.551
Park:
No. But right about here
is where

23:43.655 --> 23:44.931
Penny found the detonator,

23:45.034 --> 23:47.241
35 feet from
the bomb's epicenter.

23:47.344 --> 23:49.448
No DNA or prints
on the key fob.

23:49.551 --> 23:52.103
No finding the car owner
and working backwards.

23:52.206 --> 23:55.172
I'm sure we could buy that fob
on eBay today if we wanted.

23:55.275 --> 23:57.827
What about the masks?

23:57.931 --> 23:59.551
We could run DNA
on all the masks

23:59.655 --> 24:01.448
that were discarded
at the site.You do that,

24:01.551 --> 24:03.758
I could place suspects
in this map, give us

24:03.862 --> 24:05.172
a general idea
where everyone was

24:05.275 --> 24:06.448
when it hit the fan.

24:06.551 --> 24:08.206
One of those masks
belonged to our bomber.

24:08.310 --> 24:10.965
Back to basics.

24:11.068 --> 24:12.724
To the DNA lab.

24:17.034 --> 24:19.379
ROBY:Ooh, you in here
without Joshua?

24:19.482 --> 24:22.172
You'd better put everything
back where you found it.

24:22.275 --> 24:25.034
Mm. He just texted me.
Said he's feeling good.

24:25.724 --> 24:27.758
I, on the other hand,
am not feeling so good

24:27.862 --> 24:29.724
about reassembling
this poker table

24:29.827 --> 24:31.206
Catherine found
at the epicenter.

24:31.310 --> 24:33.448
It's a good reminder
not to stand

24:33.551 --> 24:34.965
directly over
an IED, isn't it?

24:35.068 --> 24:38.655
Mm. My theory is-is that
it actually housed the bomb.

24:38.758 --> 24:40.586
I've been looking for a mount

24:40.689 --> 24:42.862
or some sort of
identifying shrapnel.

24:42.965 --> 24:46.620
Wonder why the bomber chose this
poker table to put the bomb in

24:46.724 --> 24:48.689
and not one of the other ones.He didn't.

24:48.793 --> 24:50.862
It's not a poker table.
The wood shrapnel I found

24:50.965 --> 24:53.551
in Bart Flynn's body-- it's not
pine or oak or composite.

24:53.655 --> 24:55.827
I found rattan.ROBY: Rattan.

24:55.931 --> 24:57.275
Like what craps sticks
are made of.

24:57.379 --> 24:59.758
This is a craps table.

24:59.862 --> 25:02.241
So Bart, the casino owner,
was dealing craps?

25:02.344 --> 25:04.137
I mean, his daughter said
that he dealt craps.

25:04.241 --> 25:06.137
It would explain the rattan
blown into his body.

25:06.241 --> 25:09.310
He was holding the stick
when the bomb went off.

25:09.413 --> 25:10.620
Look at this.

25:10.724 --> 25:12.448
It must be his "everyman" act.

25:12.551 --> 25:15.275
It says here that Bart always
deals a few game of craps

25:15.379 --> 25:16.655
at his appearances.

25:16.758 --> 25:20.103
This gap is right where
the dealer was standing.

25:20.206 --> 25:22.551
The killer knew exactly where
Bart was gonna be

25:22.655 --> 25:24.275
and waited for him
to get in position.

25:24.379 --> 25:27.517
I think we just found
our intended victim.

25:28.689 --> 25:30.034
HALEY:
So my dad was, like,

25:30.137 --> 25:31.965
singled out?WILLOWS: The bomb was placed

25:32.068 --> 25:34.206
under the craps table
where your father was dealing.

25:34.310 --> 25:36.137
Everyone knew
where that would be.

25:37.482 --> 25:39.896
He was the most powerful man
in the room.

25:41.310 --> 25:43.689
He stepped on a lot of toes.

25:43.793 --> 25:45.689
Do you have any idea
who, um...

25:45.793 --> 25:48.862
We have a few suspects.
Not sure if you're aware,

25:48.965 --> 25:50.896
but the party
was infiltrated by protestors.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.724
Protestors have been there
since we broke ground.

25:53.827 --> 25:56.241
Poor Mr. Cicero
across the street

25:56.344 --> 25:57.965
and his dinky little casino.

25:58.068 --> 26:00.000
He offered to rename it
the Lucky Tortoise

26:00.103 --> 26:03.379
if they'd just go away, but,
God, those people are rabid.

26:03.482 --> 26:06.068
[sniffles]

26:06.172 --> 26:08.344
Haley, uh...

26:08.448 --> 26:10.172
you broke a nail.

26:12.689 --> 26:14.379
I lost it helping

26:14.482 --> 26:16.586
set up for-for the party.

26:16.689 --> 26:18.758
I'm just too hands-on, clearly.

26:18.862 --> 26:20.724
You told me you didn't
go to the party.

26:23.758 --> 26:26.206
I, uh, I misspoke.

26:26.310 --> 26:29.275
I did go to help
oversee the party's setup,

26:29.379 --> 26:31.827
but I only could only
stay for a few minutes.

26:31.931 --> 26:34.517
I wanted to stay.
I-I really wanted to stay.

26:34.620 --> 26:37.620
Okay, hon. It's gonna be okay.

26:39.586 --> 26:41.172
We just have to follow
all leads.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.931
If you need to speak to me
again, you can call my lawyer.

26:57.310 --> 26:59.310
You've made
a beautiful bomb, Chris.

26:59.413 --> 27:02.103
It's just a big physics problem.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.448
Smokeless black powder
has a combustion coefficient

27:04.551 --> 27:06.000
of base three.

27:06.103 --> 27:08.000
Our 22-foot blast radius
tells us approximately

27:08.103 --> 27:11.172
eight ounces were used,
and bing, bong, bing. Shockwave.

27:11.275 --> 27:12.862
It's just simple math.Well, the bomber

27:12.965 --> 27:14.862
might not have run your numbers,
but they must have had

27:14.965 --> 27:16.172
some idea how big
this was gonna be.

27:16.275 --> 27:18.206
Which is why
I think he was standing

27:18.310 --> 27:21.862
right there. Eyeline
to Bart Flynn. Close enough

27:21.965 --> 27:23.034
to the detonator they
dropped, far enough away

27:23.137 --> 27:25.862
they could get
away unscathed.

27:25.965 --> 27:27.379
Who said they were unscathed?

27:27.482 --> 27:29.068
Okay, minimally scathed.

27:29.172 --> 27:31.724
Bart Flynn's daughter Haley
broke a nail.

27:31.827 --> 27:33.103
She's only one suspect.

27:33.206 --> 27:34.965
Rhonda,
the party-crashing protestor,

27:35.068 --> 27:36.793
was hit by shrapnel.
Van lost a foot.

27:36.896 --> 27:38.103
But the detonator

27:38.206 --> 27:41.275
was found on
the other side of the room,

27:41.379 --> 27:43.620
opposite Van's foot.
I don't like 'em.

27:43.724 --> 27:45.827
Where was Haley?Hard to say.

27:45.931 --> 27:48.517
She said she broke a nail
earlier in the day.

27:48.620 --> 27:51.379
But we've got a small army
running the masks.

27:51.482 --> 27:55.103
With any luck, we'll have more
names on here soon.

27:56.482 --> 27:58.931
There she is.

27:59.034 --> 28:01.172
Uh...

28:01.275 --> 28:03.206
Hawaiian pizza.

28:03.310 --> 28:04.724
Are you sure
you're not concussed?

28:04.827 --> 28:06.482
[chuckles]

28:06.586 --> 28:10.620
It's a theme. I got
some PTO I got to use,

28:10.724 --> 28:12.379
and I was thinking...

28:12.482 --> 28:15.206
me, you, Maui.

28:17.586 --> 28:19.896
That could be fun.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.862
I just said the word Maui,
and you didn't blink.

28:22.965 --> 28:25.241
What's going on?

28:26.724 --> 28:30.103
I let it drop yesterday
since y... you almost

28:30.206 --> 28:31.724
died, but

28:31.827 --> 28:33.034
why did you tell Allie about

28:33.137 --> 28:34.620
running prints for Trey
and not me?

28:35.448 --> 28:38.241
I-I didn't tell Allie,
she was just there

28:38.344 --> 28:40.000
when Trey showed up.
Uh, it wa... It...

28:40.103 --> 28:41.586
Honestly, it wasn't
a big deal.

28:41.689 --> 28:44.896
You and I had only been together
a couple months, and...

28:46.034 --> 28:47.068
...it just
never came up.

28:47.172 --> 28:49.896
Uh, well, I remember
Trey calling.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.379
We talked about him.

28:51.482 --> 28:52.655
Yeah, and you told me that

28:52.758 --> 28:54.206
I should cut him out of my life.

28:54.310 --> 28:55.689
And, look...

28:55.793 --> 28:58.000
I wish it was that simple.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.862
Okay. Maybe it's not.

29:01.724 --> 29:03.689
Just don't cut me out.

29:03.793 --> 29:05.103
[phone dings]

29:05.206 --> 29:07.689
Ooh, dead guy on Trey's couch.

29:07.793 --> 29:10.448
Just got his record.
WLVU dropout,

29:10.551 --> 29:11.862
a few unpaid parking tickets.

29:11.965 --> 29:13.275
That's it.

29:13.379 --> 29:14.827
Doesn't really
sound like the villain

29:14.931 --> 29:17.034
that Trey made him out to be.

29:19.275 --> 29:22.068
Do you know more about Trey
than you're letting on?

29:22.172 --> 29:25.344
No, but... I don't think

29:25.448 --> 29:27.068
that Richie broke
into his apartment.

29:27.172 --> 29:29.448
I think he was there to score.

29:30.275 --> 29:32.482
Josh, if you think Trey's a
dealer, you have to report that.

29:32.586 --> 29:35.379
Well, I don't have any evidence,
and-and if I seek a warrant,

29:35.482 --> 29:37.068
then there's no
un-ringing that bell.

29:37.172 --> 29:39.896
I know you want to protect
your friend, I-I get it.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.862
But I don't want you
getting burned.

29:44.137 --> 29:47.517
So, what are you gonna do?

29:53.931 --> 29:56.034
Not too shabby, Mr. Finado.

29:56.137 --> 29:57.689
Your bomb housing's
coming along nicely.

29:57.793 --> 29:59.931
I'm starting to think we got
a pipe bomb minus the pipe.

30:00.034 --> 30:01.517
There's no end caps.
And at first,

30:01.620 --> 30:03.896
I thought this was lock
was part of a slot machine.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.172
I just watched
Chris' simulation.

30:06.275 --> 30:08.310
There were no slot machines
near the epicenter.Right.

30:08.413 --> 30:10.344
Got me thinking.
What if it wasn't a pipe,

30:10.448 --> 30:12.931
but a money box, like one
of those metal toke boxes

30:13.034 --> 30:14.310
found in gaming tables?

30:15.275 --> 30:18.137
A bomber could turn
a toke box into a pipe bomb

30:18.241 --> 30:19.896
just by welding it shut.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.517
I mean, it's a pretty clever way
to hide a bomb in plain sight.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.241
If I'm right, whoever
had access to that toke box--

30:25.344 --> 30:27.137
I'm pretty sure they're
the ones who placed the bomb.

30:27.241 --> 30:30.413
There might be a way
to pull prints off

30:30.517 --> 30:32.034
of this blackened mess.

30:32.137 --> 30:34.137
Have you heard of liquid latex?

30:35.172 --> 30:36.827
Have I heard of liquid latex?

30:40.206 --> 30:43.344
Yeah.
Yeah, I've heard of it.

30:48.724 --> 30:50.793
I was showering.

30:50.896 --> 30:54.000
Sorry. Is Trey here?

30:54.103 --> 30:55.344
He's at work.

30:55.448 --> 30:57.172
I can wait.

30:58.827 --> 31:02.793
Fine. As long as you promise
not to join me in the shower.

31:02.896 --> 31:05.344
I promise.

31:08.206 --> 31:10.586
The couch is there.

31:10.689 --> 31:12.344
Ah.

31:13.689 --> 31:14.620
[door closes]

31:14.724 --> 31:16.655
Mind if I get some water?

31:16.758 --> 31:18.586
Yeah, that's fine.[shower running]

31:33.344 --> 31:36.000
Same hiding place for 25 years.

31:44.379 --> 31:47.172
Uh, thanks for the water,
but I got to go.

31:49.586 --> 31:52.241

I'm not used to... ♪

31:52.344 --> 31:54.068
What's going on?RALPH: They asked
me to call you in,

31:54.172 --> 31:55.793
Shandara. I'm sorry.

31:55.896 --> 31:59.034
I told them I didn't believe
you would ever...Thank you,

31:59.137 --> 32:00.724
Mr. Cicero.

32:00.827 --> 32:03.448
We'll take it from
here. Thank you.

32:03.551 --> 32:06.965
Shandara. You are a difficult
woman to get in touch with.

32:07.068 --> 32:09.517
Well, I'm sorry.
It's just, uh...

32:09.620 --> 32:11.827
I don't really
want to relive that night.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.344
I assume that's
what this is about?

32:13.448 --> 32:15.413
The bomb at Bart Flynn's party
was housed in a toke box

32:15.517 --> 32:17.517
placed at his craps table.And you were pit boss

32:17.620 --> 32:21.137
that night, in charge
of collecting money, and your...

32:21.241 --> 32:22.517
your prints were
all over the box.

32:22.620 --> 32:24.482
Well, were mine
the only prints on it?

32:24.586 --> 32:27.586
We don't know that, but
we know you had access to it.

32:27.689 --> 32:29.103
Well, of course I did.

32:29.206 --> 32:31.241
But a lot of people
had access to toke boxes.

32:31.344 --> 32:33.655
Uh, my croupier, Ms. Flynn.

32:33.758 --> 32:35.724
Haley Flynn?

32:35.827 --> 32:38.413
Ms. Flynn says that
she left before the event.

32:38.517 --> 32:41.103
And no one has
challenged her story,

32:41.206 --> 32:42.482
and no one saw her.

32:42.586 --> 32:46.379
Well, I did.
She was in a worker's mask.

32:46.482 --> 32:47.896
A worker's mask?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.344
Staff wear black masks
to distinguish us from guests.

32:53.310 --> 32:54.931
I wouldn't have realized
it was her,

32:55.034 --> 32:57.275
but then she took her mask off
and threw it away.

32:57.379 --> 32:59.793
She threw her mask away?Right on the ground.

32:59.896 --> 33:01.241
Spoiled brat.

33:01.344 --> 33:04.137
How many masks are
waiting to be tested?

33:05.965 --> 33:08.103
Okay, only 23
worker masks to go.

33:08.206 --> 33:10.275
Anyone seen Catherine?

33:10.379 --> 33:12.000
She wanted me to run background
on Haley Flynn.

33:12.103 --> 33:14.517
What you got?Ms. Flynn set a lab on fire

33:14.620 --> 33:16.275
in college because they were
testing on animals.

33:16.379 --> 33:19.172
Daddy covered for her.

33:19.275 --> 33:22.000
And she's major donor to
A Home for Tortoises,

33:22.103 --> 33:23.482
Rhonda Alvarez's company.

33:23.586 --> 33:26.172
Haley was at the masquerade
party masquerading

33:26.275 --> 33:29.413
as a worker. Got
her DNA right there.

33:29.517 --> 33:32.310
So, Haley and Rhonda
were in on this together?

33:32.413 --> 33:33.758
We had the wrong motive.
Right lady.

33:33.862 --> 33:36.241
Looks like daddy's little girl
didn't kill for money.

33:36.344 --> 33:38.689
She killed for a cause.

33:44.310 --> 33:47.689
You think I killed my father
because of a fingernail?

33:47.793 --> 33:49.482
We didn't find any DNA
on the fingernail.

33:50.965 --> 33:53.172
We did find a worker's mask
with your DNA on it.

33:53.275 --> 33:54.620
CHAVEZ:
You lied to us about

33:54.724 --> 33:55.758
being at your father's party.

33:55.862 --> 33:57.068
You also have a history of arson

33:57.172 --> 33:58.724
and association
with Rhonda Alvarez.

33:58.827 --> 34:00.310
This is crazy.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.379
I did not plant a bomb
to kill my father.

34:03.482 --> 34:05.310
Then why were you at the party?

34:10.034 --> 34:11.827
I care about Rhonda's cause.

34:11.931 --> 34:14.757
And my dad, he couldn't care
less about the effects

34:14.862 --> 34:17.482
this new casino would have
on the environment.

34:17.585 --> 34:19.516
I just wanted
to make him listen.

34:19.620 --> 34:21.827
So you let Rhonda in
so she could

34:21.931 --> 34:25.447
kill your father?I let Rhonda in
to disrupt the party.

34:25.551 --> 34:27.655
She didn't tell me she
was gonna blow it up.

34:27.757 --> 34:30.482
I didn't think that she...I'm gonna advise my
client to stop talking.

34:30.585 --> 34:32.344
Yeah, it's a little
too late for that.

34:32.447 --> 34:33.551
You're under arrest, Ms. Flynn.

34:33.655 --> 34:34.793
Hands behind your back.

34:34.896 --> 34:39.068
No, please. Please.
I didn't do this.

34:59.344 --> 35:01.310
Hit it.Okay.

35:02.862 --> 35:05.827
Methamphetamines
laced with levamisole.

35:05.931 --> 35:08.586
That's that medication
they use to treat animals

35:08.689 --> 35:09.793
with parasitic worms.

35:09.896 --> 35:12.758
Is the source of these drugs
that OD?

35:12.862 --> 35:15.172
Uh, w...
Yeah, the, uh,

35:15.275 --> 35:17.517
the vic, Richie-- he was
cranked full of meth,

35:17.620 --> 35:19.310
but it was the levamisole
that killed him.

35:19.413 --> 35:21.689
According to the
tox report, he...Mm.

35:21.793 --> 35:23.724
he was allergic.Mm.

35:23.827 --> 35:26.793
Any reason there's
no case number on here?

35:26.896 --> 35:29.689
Huh? What's going on?

35:31.344 --> 35:35.000
Well, I, um...
Listen, in order...

35:35.103 --> 35:36.896
Just stop.
Just stop.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.862
For the sake of argument,
let's say

35:38.965 --> 35:40.758
that you were running tests,

35:40.862 --> 35:44.827
off the books, on a case
involving your friend.

35:44.931 --> 35:48.413
This isn't off the books.
I-I did start a case.

35:48.517 --> 35:51.103
You ran it three times, Joshua.
It's positive.

35:53.379 --> 35:55.551
You have double confirmation,

35:55.655 --> 35:58.965
you have the drugs linked
to a presumed drug dealer.

35:59.068 --> 36:00.206
Mm.

36:00.310 --> 36:02.241
And a dead guy in a room.

36:05.034 --> 36:08.241
Max...You gonna run it a fourth time?

36:11.758 --> 36:15.482
You are a loyal friend, Joshua.

36:15.586 --> 36:19.586
But now would be a good time
for you to remember who you are.

36:22.206 --> 36:23.517
SANDERS:
We found no trace

36:23.620 --> 36:26.862
of smokeless powder on
Haley or Rhonda's hands.

36:26.965 --> 36:28.241
Yeah, we need more.So...

36:28.344 --> 36:30.724
we spoke to the slot route
operator

36:30.827 --> 36:33.379
who supplied the casino
equipment for the party.

36:33.482 --> 36:35.000
Let me guess, not his toke box.

36:35.103 --> 36:36.206
A big no.

36:36.310 --> 36:39.137
But he did say
each lock comes with

36:39.241 --> 36:42.586
its own proprietary
non-duplicate key.

36:42.689 --> 36:44.655
So the missing key will be...

36:44.758 --> 36:47.068
Key?If we can reverse
engineer it,

36:47.172 --> 36:50.517
the manufacturer should be able
to tell us where the lock sold.

36:50.620 --> 36:54.000
If we can find where Rhonda
or Haley bought that toke box,

36:54.103 --> 36:55.517
we got her.

36:55.620 --> 36:57.379
Beau is with a locksmith now.

36:57.482 --> 36:59.206
Still sharp, Greg-o.

36:59.310 --> 37:00.793
Sounds like you
got this handled,

37:00.896 --> 37:04.413
so, what am I here for?Advice.

37:04.517 --> 37:07.379
You know I've always
trusted your opinion.

37:07.482 --> 37:10.206
I love the new hairstyle.
I'd keep it.

37:10.310 --> 37:13.241
Thanks. I like yours, too,
but this is about work.

37:14.413 --> 37:17.862
I'm almost kind of
halfway thinking

37:17.965 --> 37:20.379
I should come back here
full time.

37:20.482 --> 37:22.689
I mean, the hours
aren't great,

37:22.793 --> 37:25.793
but forensics is in my DNA.And what?

37:25.896 --> 37:27.620
What's the other part
of you want?

37:27.724 --> 37:30.448
I've already written five books.

37:30.551 --> 37:31.827
I love to share
what I know.

37:31.931 --> 37:34.758
It's scary to contemplate
a third career,

37:34.862 --> 37:37.172
but I'm thinking about
going to grad school

37:37.275 --> 37:39.275
to become a professor.

37:39.379 --> 37:42.448
Well, you have been
trying to teach

37:42.551 --> 37:44.448
the new kids all week.

37:44.551 --> 37:48.310
Imagine how much fun it would be
with actual students.

37:48.413 --> 37:49.689
Hey, we got a match
on the lock.

37:49.793 --> 37:51.068
We just need to make sure
it's the right person.

37:51.172 --> 37:52.344
Greg, do you want to
help me in Trace?

37:52.448 --> 37:57.000
Dr. Gregory Hojem Sanders.

37:57.103 --> 37:59.206
Go get 'em, Doctor.

38:17.413 --> 38:18.965
Remember giving us this?

38:19.068 --> 38:21.620
WILLOWS:Did you know that
smokeless powder residue

38:21.724 --> 38:24.000
lingers in the user's sweat
long after use?

38:24.827 --> 38:28.620
BEAU:
We found a mix of your DNA and
smokeless powder on the card.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.275
That was after the locksmith

38:30.379 --> 38:31.827
linked the lock that we found
at the bomb's epicenter

38:31.931 --> 38:33.586
to your casino.

38:33.689 --> 38:35.413
You built and planted
a bomb in the tent

38:35.517 --> 38:38.068
to kill Bart Flynn, Ralph.

38:38.172 --> 38:40.724
[indistinct chatter]

38:40.827 --> 38:42.413
You waited for him
to get into position,

38:42.517 --> 38:45.000
and then... boom.

38:45.103 --> 38:46.620
[people screaming]

38:47.724 --> 38:49.758
The power of the bomb
surprised you, huh?

38:49.862 --> 38:51.310
You left your detonator behind.

38:51.413 --> 38:52.758
[scoffs] I...

38:52.862 --> 38:55.137
I'm a businessman.
I'm not a...

38:55.241 --> 38:58.413
I'm not... I'm not a maniac.

38:58.517 --> 39:01.655
You're not a gun owner
is what you're not.

39:01.758 --> 39:03.655
You have no weapons
registered in your name,

39:03.758 --> 39:07.517
so can you think of
an explanation as to why

39:07.620 --> 39:08.931
you had smokeless powder

39:09.034 --> 39:10.965
on your hands?

39:16.482 --> 39:19.068
I've fought vultures like

39:19.172 --> 39:21.068
Bart Flynn for decades.

39:21.172 --> 39:23.068
You didn't want neighbors.

39:24.517 --> 39:27.137
Lucky Stakes may not be fancy.

39:28.172 --> 39:30.793
My little corner of the desert
may not be much,

39:30.896 --> 39:32.068
but it's mine!

39:33.655 --> 39:35.034
You used the protestors
as patsies.

39:35.137 --> 39:37.172
You wanted Haley to inherit
her father's land

39:37.275 --> 39:38.517
because you knew she would
never build a rival

39:38.620 --> 39:41.344
to your casino.

39:41.448 --> 39:44.931
You can't make it
in the casino business

39:45.034 --> 39:48.137
if you don'’t know
all the angles.

39:48.241 --> 39:52.241
HALEY:I guess the house
doesn't always win.

39:53.068 --> 39:55.172
Could have told you Ralph
was a freak if you just asked.

39:55.275 --> 39:58.000
You knew Ralph didn't want you
to build a casino.

39:58.103 --> 40:02.000
No one wanted my dad
building that casino.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.965
He said it was for me.

40:05.896 --> 40:08.137
As if I needed
a bigger inheritance.

40:08.241 --> 40:11.000
But it was all for his ego.

40:11.103 --> 40:12.586
His big dream.

40:12.689 --> 40:14.137
And you're not gonna
build his dream

40:14.241 --> 40:16.241
in his honor, are you?

40:16.344 --> 40:17.827
So, Ralph Cicero

40:17.931 --> 40:20.620
gets what he wants after all.

40:21.448 --> 40:23.379
I don'’t know.

40:23.482 --> 40:25.689
I mean, did he
want to die in prison?

40:45.482 --> 40:47.689
What couldn't be said
on the phone, man?

40:47.793 --> 40:49.413
Stacey called, man.
They're searching the place.

40:49.517 --> 40:50.448
You got to stop 'em.

40:50.551 --> 40:52.862
Trey, I'm not gonna do that.

40:54.655 --> 40:57.344
Oh, wow.
[short chuckle]

40:57.448 --> 41:00.172
You called it in, didn't you?

41:00.275 --> 41:01.517
Trey...

41:01.620 --> 41:03.413
I trusted you.Trey.

41:04.413 --> 41:06.482
Damn it!

41:06.586 --> 41:08.241
Trey, Richie
wasn't a bad kid, man,

41:08.344 --> 41:10.275
he was just lost, and you
took advantage of that.

41:10.379 --> 41:13.068
Richie was a grown-ass man, man.
He made his choices.

41:13.172 --> 41:15.827
And you made yours, and it's
called drug-induced homicide.

41:19.931 --> 41:22.206
You forget who you are, man.

41:22.310 --> 41:25.827
Being around you makes me forget
who I've become.

41:27.275 --> 41:29.724
You see, this is why Jeanette
doesn't trust you.

41:29.827 --> 41:32.620
Your own mother doesn't
trust you. You know,

41:32.724 --> 41:33.758
she told me not to talk to you,[car approaching]

41:33.862 --> 41:34.758
but I didn't want
to believe her.

41:34.862 --> 41:36.172
You want to know wh...

41:40.000 --> 41:41.965
You didn't just call
for a search.

41:42.068 --> 41:43.758
No, I didn't.

41:45.241 --> 41:46.931
You're going in, man.

41:47.758 --> 41:50.655
Oh, you want to add assaulting
an officer to your charges?

41:51.482 --> 41:53.103
Go ahead, man.

41:54.275 --> 41:56.000
Take him.Hands behind your back.

41:57.655 --> 41:59.517
I was your brother, Fols.

42:02.413 --> 42:03.310
Hey.

42:03.413 --> 42:05.000
Hey!

42:05.103 --> 42:08.103
This how you treat family?!Let's go.

42:09.448 --> 42:11.137
I was your brother!
