Come, let me see your face.

07:02.644 --> 07:04.516
Ew. Gross. Coop.

Lemme get one of these.
Piss off.

Our PK was horrible.

07:13.220 --> 07:14.700
What the fuck is this?

07:14.917 --> 07:16.179
Hey, Shep. How are you?

07:16.528 --> 07:18.225
I'd be a hell of a lot
better if there wasn't a girl

07:18.312 --> 07:19.705
in the boy's locker room, Henry.

07:20.445 --> 07:21.489
Where?

07:22.403 --> 07:24.579
You're a wise guy, huh?
All right.

07:25.188 --> 07:26.625
You should let me
try out for the team.

A, you aren't in high school.

07:33.283 --> 07:35.285

Yeah, she can play.
She's real good.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.730
Would you please
get out of here,
so my boys can finish up?

07:44.991 --> 07:46.601
Yeah. Sorry.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.909
Why you got to
do that to me, Henry?

07:50.170 --> 07:51.476
What? What did I do?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.869
Henry,
I've known you a long time.

[OVER TV] <i>No, no, no! No!</i>

it's time you got to bed?

- Good night, Mom.
Good night, sweetie.

08:45.486 --> 08:47.401
Good night.
Good night, Mom.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.318
Go to the store.
Get me some cigarettes.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.328
And some Lambrusco.

09:02.895 --> 09:04.157
They're not going to
sell that to me.

09:05.550 --> 09:06.768
Drop the shit.

09:08.596 --> 09:10.642
Go on, hustle.

09:50.159 --> 09:52.292
What just broke?
- Shit.

10:03.912 --> 10:05.522
Tastes better when it's free.

Cheers.

Yeah, I haven't seen
you around before.

12:24.096 --> 12:26.402
No, I just changed ranks
for regionals.

12:29.405 --> 12:30.537
Time to warm up.

12:30.624 --> 12:31.581
Okay.

Very good.

What are you doing? Come on!

13:18.150 --> 13:19.238
Hey.

13:20.369 --> 13:21.501
Are you okay?

13:22.328 --> 13:23.895
He fucking left me here.

13:24.591 --> 13:25.635
Who did?

13:26.071 --> 13:30.205
My dad. He's--He's pissed that
I messed up the routine.

13:30.858 --> 13:32.033
Shit.

13:32.860 --> 13:35.123
Yeah. He's a fucking dick.

13:36.559 --> 13:38.126
Yeah, those pants are crazy.

13:39.824 --> 13:40.868
What?

13:41.260 --> 13:43.610
His bell bottoms. Like,
he's not hiding it from anybody.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.657
Hiding what?

13:51.618 --> 13:52.837
I thought you did great.

13:56.710 --> 14:00.235
He just wants me to be
a good skater, so he can
get on TV or some shit.

14:00.453 --> 14:03.369
It's, like, all he cares about.

14:03.586 --> 14:05.153
He doesn't give a fuck about me.

14:07.329 --> 14:10.550
Hey, I think I know where Dodge
keeps some beers around here.

14:17.165 --> 14:18.688
I never met
a Jeanine before.

14:19.820 --> 14:21.082
It's not Jeanine.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.692
It's Jonine.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.521
- No shit. That's a funny name.
- Yeah.

14:26.479 --> 14:28.524
My mom made it up because

14:29.308 --> 14:31.266
she lived in Queens
with all the Italians,

14:31.397 --> 14:34.269
and she thought that
it was the most
beautiful name in the world.

14:34.835 --> 14:36.489
And then she spelled it wrong.

14:37.055 --> 14:38.099
What--

14:38.621 --> 14:40.667
And my grandma can't
say it, because of the stroke,

14:40.797 --> 14:42.712
so she just calls me Jonny.

14:44.149 --> 14:45.063
Damn,

14:46.151 --> 14:47.674
I like that.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.154
I'm--I'm gonna call you Jonny.

14:49.632 --> 14:50.895
Do whatever you want.

15:01.253 --> 15:03.124
Oh, shit.
Your nose is bleeding.

15:04.038 --> 15:05.213
Oh, fuck.

15:37.593 --> 15:39.204
Cutting it kind of close,
aren't you?

15:40.205 --> 15:41.423
It's not even full yet.

15:42.468 --> 15:43.382
Hm.

15:43.556 --> 15:44.905
She will be.

15:58.527 --> 16:01.922
Just give me three nights.
And no fucking around.

16:02.401 --> 16:04.011
- Okay?
Okay.

16:05.186 --> 16:06.666
It's too dangerous.

16:11.932 --> 16:15.370
I know you want to be an adult.
You are an adult.

16:16.806 --> 16:20.462
Yeah, but it's different for us.

16:23.074 --> 16:24.989
We got to take care
of each other.

16:26.381 --> 16:28.079
And this is me
taking care of you.

16:37.175 --> 16:39.481
You just keep pinching it there.

16:45.487 --> 16:46.749
You hungry?

16:52.886 --> 16:54.583
- No.
- All right.

16:58.587 --> 17:00.937
Not so late, okay?

17:04.898 --> 17:06.073
Would you not tell Mom?

17:09.816 --> 17:11.731
Your secret's safe with me.

17:55.122 --> 17:56.036
Hey.

17:57.646 --> 17:59.039
Just saying good night.

17:59.735 --> 18:00.780
I love you.

Nothing's happened since then.

- I just want to feel normal.

Please.

you'd be like your dad.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.374
Why do I have to buy your booze?

23:34.461 --> 23:36.115
It's because he's not allowed
in there anymore.

while he was twisted.

23:40.424 --> 23:43.296
Okay, okay.
First of all, I'm 28.

23:44.036 --> 23:46.560
Second of all, in my defense,
I was blacked out that night.

23:46.734 --> 23:47.735
How is that a defense?

23:48.954 --> 23:50.608
Are we fucking going or what?

23:51.435 --> 23:53.567
Come. It'll be fun.

Yes.

Yes. Stop.

Give me that.
It's way too fucking much.

Sure.

Fuck!

Phew.

26:30.768 --> 26:33.161
What the fuck is Otto doing?

26:33.422 --> 26:35.120
He's a really sore loser.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.470
Let's take a break, man.

26:37.688 --> 26:39.951
Fuck. He's going to get us
kicked out again.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.517
I'm going to get a drink.

26:41.692 --> 26:42.736
Get the fuck off me, bitch.

26:43.955 --> 26:46.218
I'm cool.
Don't touch me, man. I'm cool.

26:50.744 --> 26:53.268
Fucking fascist piece of shit.

27:11.025 --> 27:12.070
What is that?

27:16.988 --> 27:18.206
What are you?

27:22.123 --> 27:23.429
Okay.

27:27.389 --> 27:28.739
You want to know what I am?

27:31.785 --> 27:33.221
I'm a palindrome.

27:36.442 --> 27:37.617
Otto.

27:38.313 --> 27:40.533
O-T-T-O.

27:40.707 --> 27:44.580
I am a motherfucking palindrome.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.716
Try to make me go backwards
and it's the fucking same.

27:51.065 --> 27:52.545
Can't change me, man.

28:59.351 --> 29:00.656
Yo, I gotta go.

29:04.573 --> 29:07.228
What?
You gotta chill.

29:07.838 --> 29:09.056
I'm late.

29:09.274 --> 29:11.319
She said she's late.
Late.

29:12.059 --> 29:13.887
I just said that
I'd be back by now.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.847
What?
- I said I'd be back.

29:16.934 --> 29:18.196
Okay. Well, don't worry.

29:18.370 --> 29:20.764
Uh, Roger...
...doesn't take long.

29:28.859 --> 29:30.382
Wait. Where's she going?

29:30.512 --> 29:31.905
Come on.
Is it past your bed time?

29:32.514 --> 29:35.082
Fucking... JONNY: Heather, wait!

29:46.050 --> 29:47.486
No!

31:23.538 --> 31:24.975
Baby, come on.

31:31.503 --> 31:33.722
Come on.

32:36.350 --> 32:37.569
You're okay.

32:38.396 --> 32:40.311
Mom?

32:43.705 --> 32:45.751
Get the fuck away from me!

32:47.274 --> 32:48.667
Go on.

33:17.391 --> 33:18.392
Peterson.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.699
You better start
making more saves, my friend.

33:20.786 --> 33:22.092
Last game, we got murdered.

33:22.309 --> 33:24.007
- Sorry, coach.
- Stop saying sorry.

33:24.181 --> 33:27.445
And quit eating
those fucking corn dogs
or I will replace you.

33:30.230 --> 33:31.536
Seriously, Peterson,

33:31.927 --> 33:33.538
I got coupons
that saved more than you.

33:34.234 --> 33:35.888
Starts and stops. Let's go.

33:52.774 --> 33:55.125
Look who it is.

33:56.778 --> 33:57.910
This old thing?

33:57.997 --> 33:59.216
I thought you were a goner.

33:59.781 --> 34:00.956
Is the seat taken?

34:06.310 --> 34:07.702
What happened to your eye?

34:08.442 --> 34:10.096
You get in a fight or something?

34:10.183 --> 34:12.881
No, just on the ice, you know?

34:15.188 --> 34:17.712
It's a pretty cool place
to hang out, I guess.

34:18.539 --> 34:19.714
Yeah, um...

34:20.759 --> 34:22.848
Rick was supposed to pick me up.

34:26.504 --> 34:27.592
Rick?

34:29.942 --> 34:31.248
Rick here?

34:34.294 --> 34:35.861
You got someone fucking
waiting on you.

34:37.428 --> 34:38.429
It's whatever.

34:39.473 --> 34:41.910
No, it's not.
It's fucking cold out.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.957
He's just at baseball practice
or something.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.224
Your hair is so thick.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.400
I can condition it for you.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.666
So pretty. Such a waste.

34:59.928 --> 35:01.278
Thank you.

35:01.539 --> 35:03.671
I just mean you should
take care of it, you know?

35:04.759 --> 35:06.283
I use an egg mask.

35:07.153 --> 35:08.154
Gross.

35:08.372 --> 35:09.764
It's good for you.

35:09.851 --> 35:11.331
I'll give you eggs.

35:28.087 --> 35:30.481
Babe. The car.

35:32.178 --> 35:33.962
We should hang out again soon.

35:43.102 --> 35:44.582
You're really fucking late.

35:52.242 --> 35:53.852
Who the fuck are you?

36:14.525 --> 36:16.614
So, where were you last night?

36:20.792 --> 36:22.272
So you were with a boy, huh?

36:24.187 --> 36:26.450
Well, your mom's royally pissed.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.017
Nothing happened.

36:29.757 --> 36:30.715
But it could have.

36:33.805 --> 36:35.459
You don't get to
fuck around, Heather.

36:37.765 --> 36:38.853
Get off my back.

36:39.027 --> 36:40.899
What? Heather?

36:41.247 --> 36:42.857
- Give me a fucking break, Dad.
No.

36:42.944 --> 36:45.469
You don't get
to talk to me like that. Ever!

37:12.931 --> 37:14.149
Mom?

37:23.507 --> 37:24.551
Fuck.

38:48.461 --> 38:50.202
[OVER TV] <i>Has an easy time
of it and it goes.</i>

38:50.855 --> 38:52.552
<i>Another Vancouver goal!</i>

38:56.774 --> 38:58.253
<i>Sorry I missed that one.</i>

39:00.908 --> 39:01.779
What?

39:03.650 --> 39:04.912
Ignore them, they're freaks.

39:05.130 --> 39:06.087
Jeez.

39:06.914 --> 39:09.613
Hey, Heather.
I thought we'd agreed

39:09.787 --> 39:12.529
we weren't going to spill
our secrets in front of guests.

39:15.836 --> 39:18.796
You see, I found these two...

39:20.188 --> 39:25.237
in the middle of the woods,
late at night, almost starving.

39:26.369 --> 39:28.806
We are blessed
they can even speak.

39:29.023 --> 39:30.416
Shut up.

39:31.591 --> 39:32.505
See?

39:33.550 --> 39:36.988
But every day
they bring me so much joy.

39:37.554 --> 39:40.034
But now you're going to
give your sister

39:40.121 --> 39:42.559
- some space. Come on, boys.
- But the game's just started.

39:42.776 --> 39:45.170
We got drills in the morning.
Let's go. Come on.

39:45.518 --> 39:47.085
Heather has to practice.

39:47.259 --> 39:48.565
Yeah.
Don't worry about her.

39:49.174 --> 39:50.393
Good night, girls.

39:50.654 --> 39:52.438
- Good night, Mr. Anderson.
- Good night, Dad.

40:09.455 --> 40:10.978
Do you guys have a dog?

40:12.632 --> 40:13.720
No.

40:14.112 --> 40:15.200
Why?

40:16.680 --> 40:18.812
I don't know,
it kind of seems like it.

40:19.465 --> 40:20.640
<i>We're in overtime.</i>

40:20.727 --> 40:22.425
<i>First goal was in
five minutes, sudden death.</i>

40:28.779 --> 40:29.823
Got any beer?

40:37.527 --> 40:39.920
Shit. You scared me.

40:46.187 --> 40:47.450
What's in there?

40:48.320 --> 40:49.626
Uh, it's my dad's room.

40:49.887 --> 40:50.975
Oh.

40:54.065 --> 40:55.458
What's with all the locks?

40:55.806 --> 40:57.285
He's just a private person.

40:59.374 --> 41:00.375
Okay.

41:04.118 --> 41:07.165
Do you want to, um,
go back downstairs, maybe?

41:08.558 --> 41:09.559
Is this your car?

41:12.170 --> 41:13.301
Nah.

41:13.563 --> 41:16.827
I mean, it is,
but it's busted, so...

41:17.131 --> 41:18.393
Kind of late, huh?

41:24.965 --> 41:26.793
Hey, Mom. I...

41:27.533 --> 41:29.187
Sorry, I thought
you were asleep.

41:29.970 --> 41:31.581
Mom, this is Jonny.

41:33.583 --> 41:35.498
Jonny, this is my mom.

41:36.455 --> 41:39.023
Yeah, I thought
I heard someone else.

41:39.763 --> 41:40.894
It's nice to meet you.

41:42.069 --> 41:43.636
Where's your father?
- In bed.

41:45.595 --> 41:48.946
Well, he's a fucking
son of a bitch, isn't he?

41:49.033 --> 41:50.469
Good night, Mom.

41:51.078 --> 41:51.992
What?

41:53.080 --> 41:55.169
Are you embarrassed
of me or something?

41:57.041 --> 41:59.696
Who the fuck are you?

42:00.653 --> 42:03.613
- I'm a friend of Heather's.
- Good night, Mom.

42:04.657 --> 42:07.530
Well, Heather,
it's a little late for friends.

42:08.574 --> 42:10.141
Okay, I can go.

42:13.144 --> 42:14.667
You don't
have a clue, do you?

42:16.626 --> 42:17.583
What?

42:18.149 --> 42:21.544
You don't even know
what they are.

42:24.242 --> 42:25.330
Let's go.

42:48.179 --> 42:51.051
Let's just stay here
till she passes out.

42:51.661 --> 42:53.184
Only takes her,
like, ten minutes.

42:57.144 --> 43:01.453
- Is she always like that?
Yeah, most nights.

43:02.672 --> 43:04.064
Sometimes she gets so wasted,

43:05.370 --> 43:07.328
she'll crawl into my bed and...

43:08.373 --> 43:09.548
then she'll piss herself.

43:13.465 --> 43:14.771
Damn. That's fucked.

43:18.470 --> 43:20.907
You can go if you want.
- No, I want to stay.

43:21.647 --> 43:24.824
I'm sorry, this really--
this really fucking sucks.

43:27.044 --> 43:28.219
I have an idea.

43:29.612 --> 43:35.008
Let's pretend that we're
going somewhere really,
really far away from here.

43:36.053 --> 43:36.923
Okay?

43:39.534 --> 43:40.623
Yeah, I like that.

43:57.291 --> 43:58.249
Yeah, nice try.

43:58.466 --> 44:00.294
How did I miss that? Come on!

44:00.425 --> 44:02.732
You suck, Cooper.
You don't!

44:03.907 --> 44:05.517
Get after that puck.

44:07.258 --> 44:08.999
Come on,
skate like you mean it!

44:09.564 --> 44:12.176
Come on,
give me the puck, Hardy!

44:13.525 --> 44:14.961
Denied!

44:15.048 --> 44:16.746
Can't get it past her!

44:16.920 --> 44:19.096
Cooper, get after it.

44:20.314 --> 44:21.620
- Your shot.
Hey!

44:22.926 --> 44:24.101
Hey!

44:24.971 --> 44:27.278
Stole all that candy
from a baby. Here he comes.

44:27.582 --> 44:30.324
Ooh. Denied!
Fuck!

44:33.066 --> 44:35.242
Oh, what's this?
I can shoot better than you.

44:35.373 --> 44:37.201
- Shut up!
What's that?

44:37.984 --> 44:39.203
Easy.

44:39.333 --> 44:41.031
Where's the sportsmanship
I taught you?

44:41.118 --> 44:42.685
It's late. I'm hungry.

44:43.424 --> 44:45.513
All right.
Heather, pack it up.

44:49.387 --> 44:50.518
Let's go.

44:57.743 --> 45:00.137
- You okay, Dad?
- Yeah, yeah.

45:03.227 --> 45:04.532
Tryouts are next week.

45:07.361 --> 45:09.015
Shit! Do you hear that?

45:09.102 --> 45:10.016
- How'd that happen?
- Shit!

45:16.675 --> 45:17.937
Where are you going?

45:19.286 --> 45:20.548
See you, suckers.

45:33.257 --> 45:35.128
I have to be there
at five, okay?

45:35.346 --> 45:36.564
You got it, baby.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.089
Heather, I'm not joking, okay?

45:39.176 --> 45:40.743
He's going to be pissed
if I'm late.

45:40.830 --> 45:43.093
We're almost there, okay?
Did you bring your skates?

48:03.189 --> 48:04.712
Fuck you.

48:08.673 --> 48:09.892
Let's go!

48:27.344 --> 48:29.259
So, how does it feel back there?

48:29.476 --> 48:30.695
I wouldn't push it.

48:31.261 --> 48:33.350
Because it feels
pretty good on this side.

48:33.698 --> 48:35.047
You cannot have a job.

48:36.135 --> 48:39.182
All right, I do need that, so...

48:39.791 --> 48:42.011
What are you havin'?
I'm hungry.

48:43.142 --> 48:44.839
Uh, nachos.

48:46.015 --> 48:47.755
Okay, and what about you?

48:48.452 --> 48:51.150
I think I will have
some popcorn.

48:51.368 --> 48:54.588
Popcorn and nachos
for the lovely maidens, please.

48:54.719 --> 48:55.894
Coming right up.

48:58.984 --> 49:01.682
You fucking son of a bitch!

49:05.121 --> 49:06.296
How did she get here?

49:06.687 --> 49:08.689
Piece of shit!

49:09.473 --> 49:11.214
What? Mom's not allowed
to the fucking game?

49:11.344 --> 49:14.869
I mean, just look at this
family fucking outing!

49:14.957 --> 49:16.262
Yeah, I know, I know.

49:16.610 --> 49:19.962
God forbid that
I'm included in anything
in this fucking family!

49:20.092 --> 49:22.051
Don't touch me,
don't you fucking touch me.

49:22.225 --> 49:24.270
Am I not allowed
- to be here, huh?
- No. Come on.

49:24.357 --> 49:25.532
Aren't I allowed to be here?

49:25.924 --> 49:27.621
Can I not be here?

49:27.795 --> 49:30.276
She's my kid, too,
for fuck's sake!

49:30.929 --> 49:35.412
Don't touch me!
I don't want to go home!

49:36.587 --> 49:37.762
I'm so sorry.

49:38.023 --> 49:39.372
You're such an asshole!

49:39.807 --> 49:40.852
It's okay.

49:44.769 --> 49:47.946
Kid, this one's on the house.

49:50.296 --> 49:51.384
Thanks, Dodge.

51:11.116 --> 51:12.770
I asked for space.

51:12.987 --> 51:13.988
You can't just call me.

51:14.163 --> 51:15.990
I called you after practice.

51:16.078 --> 51:18.080
Two days in a fucking row.
And you didn't respond to me.

51:18.950 --> 51:21.257
You know I'm the only person
in this town

51:21.344 --> 51:23.041

51:23.824 --> 51:25.826
I asked for space, Rick.

51:28.699 --> 51:29.874
Hey, guys. What's up?

51:31.397 --> 51:33.443
- Fuck off.
- Rick, will you please

51:33.530 --> 51:35.184
just back the fuck up
for a minute, please?

51:37.055 --> 51:38.187
You're going out there?

51:39.144 --> 51:41.755
Yeah, I guess I have to practice
against the whole team.

51:42.060 --> 51:43.801
I'll be out there
in two seconds.

51:44.541 --> 51:46.978
Yo, go away.

51:50.286 --> 51:51.504

stay and watch.

51:51.852 --> 51:53.202
No, I want to.

52:23.406 --> 52:24.450
Fuck off!

52:25.712 --> 52:27.758
All right, boys,
let's go. Let's do this.

All right, boys, bring it in.

<i>Well, how did it go?</i>

54:14.952 --> 54:16.301

What happened?</i>

54:19.217 --> 54:21.611

don't want to talk about it.

54:47.637 --> 54:49.421
I don't hate many things,

54:49.508 --> 54:53.164
but I sure as fuck
hate baseball.

55:06.046 --> 55:08.135
Drink up, Rick, you bitch!

55:10.399 --> 55:11.835

You're gonna pay!

55:42.126 --> 55:43.649
Is Rick always like that?

55:46.913 --> 55:48.698
I don't want to talk about it.

55:51.483 --> 55:53.833
Earlier,
the way he was with you,

55:54.094 --> 55:56.358
it makes me so mad in a way
I've never fucking felt.

55:58.751 --> 56:04.017
Fuck Rick. Fuck Rick
and his teeny, tiny,
little Rick dick.

56:06.150 --> 56:07.412
I just wish I could protect you.

56:08.587 --> 56:09.675
You do.

56:18.118 --> 56:19.816
- We're gonna have to scare you.
- Give me that.

56:20.773 --> 56:23.036
Okay.
Uh, once upon a time,

56:23.994 --> 56:25.691
there was a little old man

56:25.778 --> 56:28.607
who lived at the end
of a dark and scary road.

56:28.738 --> 56:30.174
He lived all by himself.

56:30.348 --> 56:31.393
He was very lonely.

56:31.741 --> 56:34.308
No one came to visit him.
So, in the nighttime,

56:34.396 --> 56:37.790
he would lay awake in the dark
and just pray to die.

56:39.575 --> 56:40.924
Till one night,

56:41.446 --> 56:45.232
he felt something,
like a pressure,
going up his leg.

56:45.929 --> 56:47.757
Felt it on his stomach,
and he thought,

56:48.279 --> 56:51.848
"Is this some ghost lady
trying to make my night?"

56:51.978 --> 56:53.850
You perv.

56:54.328 --> 56:56.330
He pulls back the covers and...

56:57.027 --> 56:58.028
it's a snake!

56:58.115 --> 56:59.856
And it bites
his pecker clean off.

57:00.160 --> 57:01.771
Fuck.

57:02.989 --> 57:04.251
See, I scared you.

57:05.035 --> 57:06.471
You did not scare me.

57:06.602 --> 57:08.430
That was so stupid.

57:08.604 --> 57:10.736
Well, it is a true story, so...

57:10.910 --> 57:13.435
Mm-hm. Right.

57:16.655 --> 57:17.700
Should we go?

57:20.659 --> 57:21.834
Where?

57:31.888 --> 57:35.282
So, do you come here often?

57:35.587 --> 57:37.197
Remember how
I scared you earlier?

57:37.807 --> 57:39.678
You did not scare me.

57:41.985 --> 57:43.421
Agree to disagree.

57:46.206 --> 57:47.817
I wonder what would
really scare you.

57:50.863 --> 57:51.951
What do you mean?

57:52.952 --> 57:54.824
I wonder if what I want
would scare you.

57:57.740 --> 57:58.871
What do you want?

58:03.180 --> 58:06.052
Oh, hello.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:37.728
Don't blame him though.
I definitely tried to get that.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:42.385
I--I bet your mom's hot.

01:16:44.169 --> 01:16:45.606
Oh, my mom's dead.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.566
- She killed herself.
- Jonny, what the fuck?

01:16:49.653 --> 01:16:50.741
It's true.

01:16:54.484 --> 01:16:56.312
Well, we all know
that your mom's a dog.

01:16:56.965 --> 01:16:57.966
Fuck you, buddy.

01:16:58.706 --> 01:16:59.707
Woof!

01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:04.755
Actually, Heather's mom
is a drunk.

01:17:05.974 --> 01:17:09.238
Sometimes she goes into
Heather's bed because
she thinks it's her own.

01:17:11.719 --> 01:17:12.807
Don't.

01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:14.983
And then she pisses herself.

01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:17.115
Right, Heather?

01:17:20.597 --> 01:17:21.554
Shit.

01:17:23.252 --> 01:17:24.209
That's fucked up.

01:17:43.098 --> 01:17:44.403
What the fuck
is going on?

01:17:46.841 --> 01:17:48.494
I don't think
we should hang out anymore.

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:54.544
Jonny.

01:17:54.849 --> 01:17:55.763
Don't call me that.

01:17:58.766 --> 01:18:00.724
I'm not gay, okay, so...

01:18:01.682 --> 01:18:02.987
Can you just get over it?

01:18:05.076 --> 01:18:06.121
Just go home.

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:12.388
Jonny.

01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:19.830
Jonny, come on.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.792
So, end of the third,

01:19:51.922 --> 01:19:55.621
we got your buddy,
Peterson, or, yeah,
whatever the hell his name is.

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.102
Boy, that kid,

01:19:58.929 --> 01:20:00.975
never seen a puck
he didn't like.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.631
It was a good game.
You should have come.

01:20:08.896 --> 01:20:10.071
Dad, you okay?

01:20:10.941 --> 01:20:14.162
Yeah, I'm fine. I just got...

01:20:15.641 --> 01:20:16.817
some heart--

01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:23.301
<i>Dad?</i>

01:21:46.863 --> 01:21:47.908
Dad.

01:22:12.323 --> 01:22:13.368
Okay, boys.

01:22:14.717 --> 01:22:17.720
Come on. Say your goodbyes
to your father.

01:25:39.922 --> 01:25:41.271
What the fuck?

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:44.144
What happened?

01:25:45.536 --> 01:25:46.581
Move.

01:25:46.842 --> 01:25:48.713
No,
I don't want you here.

01:25:48.887 --> 01:25:50.628
Hardy, move.

01:25:54.893 --> 01:25:58.201
You, you dyke. Look at you!

01:26:01.944 --> 01:26:03.206
You killed him.

01:26:05.469 --> 01:26:06.644
You killed Dad.

01:26:07.602 --> 01:26:08.777
Fuck!

01:26:12.476 --> 01:26:14.261
He found out about you.

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:16.611
And it killed him.

01:26:18.482 --> 01:26:19.570
Bitch!

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:24.227
Stop! Stop it.

01:26:24.706 --> 01:26:27.491
Stop it! Stop! Stop.

01:26:28.492 --> 01:26:29.537
Stop it.

01:26:30.538 --> 01:26:33.367
- Stop. God damn it. Stop it!
Stop.

01:26:33.976 --> 01:26:35.586
Heather, what the fuck
is happening?

01:26:37.893 --> 01:26:39.764
Heather, come back here!

01:26:41.592 --> 01:26:44.813
You can't leave. Not tonight!

01:26:44.987 --> 01:26:46.293
Heather!

01:27:15.322 --> 01:27:16.453
Look at that.

01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:20.240
It's turning red.

01:27:59.714 --> 01:28:00.889
What's up, Heather?

01:28:16.426 --> 01:28:18.341
Forget it, man. They suck.

01:28:18.472 --> 01:28:21.518
Let's go have a smoke, you know?

01:28:23.825 --> 01:28:25.043
Chill?

01:28:27.829 --> 01:28:29.352
You want some pot?

01:28:36.098 --> 01:28:37.055
No.

01:28:39.841 --> 01:28:41.973
All right.
Well, okay. Fuck this.

01:28:59.991 --> 01:29:01.079
What happened?

01:29:05.823 --> 01:29:07.782
You don't get to just fucking
pretend you don't know me.

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:14.658
Oh!

01:29:15.006 --> 01:29:16.356
Fuck.

01:29:17.008 --> 01:29:18.793
I think you should
get out of here.

01:29:21.056 --> 01:29:23.232
- No.
- Heather, please,

01:29:23.406 --> 01:29:25.277
I really think you should--No.

01:29:26.714 --> 01:29:27.758
You're hurting me.

01:29:30.065 --> 01:29:31.458
You're fucking hurting me.

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:37.681
What the fuck happened to you?

01:29:40.771 --> 01:29:43.557
Jonine, is this dyke
giving you trouble?

01:29:45.254 --> 01:29:47.517
Rick, just relax, okay?

01:29:47.691 --> 01:29:50.172
- What's your deal, bro?
Hey. Hey!

01:29:50.477 --> 01:29:52.304
Don't fucking touch her.
Heather.

01:29:52.435 --> 01:29:54.829
Let's go.
Heather, please.

01:29:55.003 --> 01:29:56.657
You pretend you don't
fucking know me.

01:29:56.874 --> 01:29:59.050
You don't say my fucking name!

01:30:00.487 --> 01:30:03.620
You hear me, Jonny!
You don't say my fucking name!

01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:06.710

01:30:18.156 --> 01:30:19.419
Dyke!

01:30:20.028 --> 01:30:22.944
Bitch!
No one wants you here.

01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:25.425
Go home.

01:30:25.599 --> 01:30:26.991
You think it
makes you look tough?

01:30:28.297 --> 01:30:30.168
Hitting your fucking girl?

01:30:35.783 --> 01:30:36.871
Huh?

01:30:38.786 --> 01:30:40.744
Holy fuck.

01:30:43.443 --> 01:30:45.488
Go inside, lock the door,
don't open 'til I knock.

01:30:45.749 --> 01:30:46.968
- Hell yeah.
Go.

01:30:47.055 --> 01:30:48.143
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:04.594
Let's go.

01:31:32.187 --> 01:31:35.190
Leave Jonine alone, you cunt!

01:31:40.021 --> 01:31:43.198
You, your family,
your stupid fucking brothers,

01:31:43.328 --> 01:31:45.505

01:31:46.462 --> 01:31:47.724
Jonine ain't interested.

01:31:48.682 --> 01:31:50.597
So leave her alone,
and while you're at it,

01:31:50.727 --> 01:31:52.773
don't fucking come
around here anymore either.

01:31:55.993 --> 01:31:57.647

even hack it.

01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:59.475
Bitch.

01:32:07.178 --> 01:32:10.442
Hey, Rick.
You should know something.

01:32:13.358 --> 01:32:15.099
You can't even make her come.

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.070
- Yeah? And you can?
- Yeah.

01:32:31.202 --> 01:32:33.378
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:34.815
So...

01:32:37.774 --> 01:32:38.949
Fuck you!

01:35:42.089 --> 01:35:44.787
You have to leave. Tonight.

01:35:46.093 --> 01:35:47.790
