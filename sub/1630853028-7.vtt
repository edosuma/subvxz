WEBVTT

00:07.091 --> 00:08.300
So, what's the plan?

00:08.384 --> 00:09.552
What?

00:09.635 --> 00:11.095
What is the plan?

00:11.178 --> 00:13.097
What are plants?

00:13.180 --> 00:14.432
Which plants?

00:14.515 --> 00:16.851
I don't know, they're jeans!

00:18.144 --> 00:19.770
This is so stupid!

00:19.854 --> 00:21.480
We could've just gone out
for a walk

00:21.564 --> 00:23.274
and kept our voices down!

00:24.275 --> 00:25.401
What?

00:29.780 --> 00:31.115
All right, look.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.408
So, Choak and Kannerman bought
your code,

00:32.491 --> 00:34.452
and that's the guts
of Freeyond, right?

00:34.535 --> 00:35.703
Yeah, it makes me sick.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.747
But it means we have
home code advantage.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.374
So, did you put in
any back doors?

00:40.458 --> 00:41.500
Yes.

00:41.584 --> 00:43.252
Yeah, I unlock
with my retina scan.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.712
I mean, that could still work.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.172
Right? Do I still have a retina?

00:46.255 --> 00:48.924
I mean, I built your face
with photos and memories,

00:49.008 --> 00:50.176
so...

00:50.259 --> 00:51.677
Let me look.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.606
You see anything?

01:03.689 --> 01:06.066
Yeah.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.905
I mean, I-I have to look closer.

01:17.912 --> 01:18.954
Shit.

01:19.038 --> 01:20.664
There's nothing good in there.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.749
Okay, rude.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.543
We need allies.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.131
And the only ones I can think of
that would want in on this fight

01:29.215 --> 01:30.508
are the Ludds.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.093
I have to go back.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.263
I mean, I guess it'll be nice
to see your boyfriend again.

01:36.347 --> 01:40.559
- Ex-boyfriend.

01:40.643 --> 01:43.896
Oh... no...

01:43.979 --> 01:46.148
Shut up. I can't. Okay.

01:46.232 --> 01:47.650
This is gonna be fun, yeah.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.860
Yeah, it's great time for me
to be begging for help.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.195
I don't love the sound of you
out in the woods

01:51.278 --> 01:52.696
with some rejected weirdo creep.

01:54.406 --> 01:55.908
I'll bring Ivan.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.576
Yeah.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.036
Now I feel much better.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.259
Huh, what did I tell you?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.052
Lookee, lookee.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.388
Oh, my God.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.474
Ooh, and it comes with
a state-of-the-art food printer.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.309
Pretty great, right?

02:22.393 --> 02:23.936
This is amazing.

02:25.396 --> 02:27.606
And every room comes
with a massage wall.

02:27.690 --> 02:30.401
Oh, fuck me.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.320
This is what I am talking about.

02:34.864 --> 02:36.240
This is seriously
your first time

02:36.323 --> 02:37.783
in a low-level luxury apartment?

02:37.867 --> 02:39.827
This is low-level?

02:39.910 --> 02:41.745
You like it here, Leeshy?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.914
Yeah. It is nice.

02:43.998 --> 02:47.459
But I make $38,000 at both
Horizen and FalafelHa...

02:47.543 --> 02:49.503
Gross. Gross, gross, gross.
I don't want to know that.

02:49.587 --> 02:53.007
- Have some consideration.
- Sorry.

02:53.090 --> 02:56.135
Let me share a little piece of
info with you, Leeshy.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.429
You're promoted again.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.973
VP, baby. VP life.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.933
You're gonna make
a hundred grand a year,

03:03.017 --> 03:04.268
and that's just for starters.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.561
Next year, you should make
probably...

03:05.644 --> 03:07.897
Wait, did you say $100,000?

03:07.980 --> 03:12.651
And it's only uphill from here,
my Leeshy Martini.

03:12.735 --> 03:16.030
New foods, new friends,
new world.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.197
You ready?

03:24.622 --> 03:26.582
Hell yeah.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.960
Get this,
she literally slipped

03:30.044 --> 03:31.629
and knocked her teeth out.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.589
So, she was like...

03:33.672 --> 03:36.842
She was like,
"Oh, God. Oh, my teeth!

03:36.926 --> 03:38.552
Where are my teeth?"

03:40.137 --> 03:42.181
Oh, my God. Who is this?

03:42.264 --> 03:44.892
This is my cousin,
learning how to ride a bike.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.810
- Idiot.
- Oh, my God.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.646
Nice going, Abigail.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.815
- She's nine.
- Aw.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.654
I'm gonna be such a good mom.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.155
- Right?
- Right on.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.240
- Moms are hot.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.992
Well, let's hope Nathan agrees.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.452
You got to make me look real hot

04:03.535 --> 04:05.371
for this digital-baby
doctor appointment.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.374
Yes. Oh, God.
I'm gonna make you look so fire.

04:08.457 --> 04:11.502
But wait, hottie,
aren't you still alive?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.337
So no digi-baby for you, baby.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.131
I just want Nathan to agree
to a digital baby.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.217
That'll be proof that he's
committed to me

04:18.300 --> 04:19.468
and my relationship with him.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.637
Mm. Okay.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.390
And then, I'm gonna tell him
that we can have a real baby

04:24.473 --> 04:27.309
in real life,
because his body's almost done.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.520
- Happy ending.
- Oh.

04:29.603 --> 04:33.107
Yes, he'll be so happy
that he won't remember

04:33.190 --> 04:34.775
you lied to him for months
and made him out of his mind

04:34.858 --> 04:36.652
with guilt.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.154
Okay, what your robobrain
can't process is

04:39.238 --> 04:41.991
that Nathan wants a child,
and I will give him one.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.867
So all the love that he feels
for that baby

04:43.951 --> 04:46.412
is just gonna get, you know,
smeared together

04:46.495 --> 04:47.705
with his feelings for me,

04:47.788 --> 04:49.289
and then
the next thing he knows,

04:49.373 --> 04:51.458
wedding bells in real life.

04:51.542 --> 04:55.838
I'll be Mrs. Ingrid Brown,
IRL, bitch.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.966
- Oh, that's my alarm.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.801
Okay. I got to meet Nathan
at the doc's,

05:00.884 --> 05:03.053
so just, like, finish the hair,
okay? Do it.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.850
Wish me luck.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.477
Man, I just feel
so guilty.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.229
Oh, good God,
I can't even breathe.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.106
Of course you don't want to have
a baby with Ingrid.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.358
Although he would be
my great-grandson

05:16.442 --> 05:17.776
if things worked out
with Mildred.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.529
Not Ingrid. Nora.
Sending her back into danger.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.240
I was just about to say, the
real question is Nora, right?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.075
Yeah, this is gonna keep us
up at night.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.577
Like a sleepover, huh?

05:27.619 --> 05:29.830
I can't help her, so I have
to send her back to the Ludds.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.874
What kind of man am I?

05:31.957 --> 05:34.835
You are
Nathan motherfucking Brown.

05:34.918 --> 05:38.714
Okay? You are the strongest,
bravest, smartest,

05:38.797 --> 05:40.674
most brilliant man
I will ever know.

05:40.758 --> 05:43.594
- And I would give
my left nut to be half...
- Luke.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.387
Stop. You have to stop.

05:45.471 --> 05:47.806
I told you it makes me
so uncomfortable.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.641
- Sorry.
- Great.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.478
- It's time.
Come meet me, Daddy.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.396
Ew, you are not my child.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.606
Well, I might be,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.524
if you go to this appointment
on time.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.026
- Leave me alone.
- Say you love me.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.070
- No, don't do it, Nathan.
- I'm not.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.446
Say it. Do it.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.573
Hey, get the fuck out of here,
you little baby,

06:04.656 --> 06:06.283
before I kick the shit
out of you.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.577
- Geez.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.829
He's creepy, right?

06:10.913 --> 06:12.456
Gonna be seeing him
in my dreams.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.582
No. No, no, no, no. No.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.125
Your dreams are not
child-friendly.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.335
They are now.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.045
Aleesha set me to G Dream,

06:18.128 --> 06:20.380
so I can only dream about
kittens and cotton candy

06:20.464 --> 06:22.549
and rainbows and frozen yogurt.

06:24.802 --> 06:27.096
Ouchie!

06:29.098 --> 06:32.226
- It's bullshit.
- Maybe I should just have
a baby with Ingrid.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.478
Right? If it wasn't for me,
she'd still be alive.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.146
No more guilt. Okay?

06:36.230 --> 06:37.147
You follow your heart.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.108
You start by breaking up
with Ingrid.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.610
Do it for you.
Then you grab your jammies,

06:41.693 --> 06:42.778
you bunk down with me,

06:42.861 --> 06:44.780
and we whisper all night
about what comes next.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.406
You got it?

06:46.490 --> 06:48.367
Yeah. No. Yeah. Yes.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.244
Yeah, uh, I don't know.
I got it.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.411
It's time.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.622
- You go tell her, dude.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.999
I'm gonna build a pillow wall
down the middle of my bed.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.001
- Which side do you want?
- The couch.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.420
That wasn't one of the...

07:00.504 --> 07:02.047
options.
Y-You got stuff going on.

07:02.131 --> 07:03.966
He's got stuff going on,
everybody.

07:12.474 --> 07:16.478
I'm gonna put a baby
in you, Nathan Brown.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.982
Hey, guys.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.693
So, any questions
about the process?

07:22.776 --> 07:26.196
Yeah. Can we make her eyes,
um, sparkle?

07:26.280 --> 07:28.323
- Easy.
- Great.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.993
Whose eyes should she have,
Nathan?

07:31.076 --> 07:32.744
I don't know.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.329
- Let's just say mine.
- Great.

07:34.413 --> 07:38.458
Done. And now, who's going
to carry this digital baby?

07:38.542 --> 07:40.043
- Not it.
- Uh...

07:40.127 --> 07:42.171
So you, Nathan?

07:42.254 --> 07:43.922
- No, thank you.
- Wha...

07:44.006 --> 07:46.216
Baby, this is serious.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.343
Okay? We're getting a baby.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.554
Okay, uh, look.

07:50.637 --> 07:54.349
Ingrid, you know how much
I care about you, right?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.852
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, you-you uploaded
for me.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.897
Yes. Yep. I sure did.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.400
But you also want me to be
truly happy, too, right?

08:03.483 --> 08:04.860
Um...

08:06.778 --> 08:08.155
Okay, okay.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.073
What are you saying, Brownie?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.825
I can't do this.

08:11.909 --> 08:14.119
- Honey, honey. Hey, look at me.
- Mm-hmm.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.787
I know that it's scary, okay?

08:15.871 --> 08:20.042
But guess who's gonna be right
by your side the entire time.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.251
- Who? Great.
- Me.

08:21.335 --> 08:24.421
And I'm gonna be a great mom.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.964
Mm-hmm.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.467
Nathan,
if it makes you feel better,

08:28.550 --> 08:31.845
when your water breaks,
it doesn't have to be water.

08:31.929 --> 08:35.015
Gatorade. Merlot.
Chocolate milk.

08:35.098 --> 08:37.309
Whatever makes you feel
most comfortable.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.978
- Where would that
even come out of?
- Your anus.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.899
- Okay. He's in.
- Mm-mm.

08:43.982 --> 08:48.278
Um, I will have no part of this,
so I'm just gonna go.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.239
Nathan, Nathan, hey.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.199
Honey, we're a team, right?

08:52.282 --> 08:53.825
Now prove it.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.286
Look, if you need this to happen
right now,

08:56.370 --> 08:58.121
then you can raise
your own clone, okay?

08:58.205 --> 08:59.790
Otherwise... mm-mm.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.334
Clones aren't legal.
Nathan needs to contribute

09:02.417 --> 09:05.087
a little bit of his info--
even one percent would do--

09:05.170 --> 09:06.630
so that it's a new human,

09:06.713 --> 09:09.758
and also so that he's
financially liable, too.

09:09.841 --> 09:13.470
Nathan, will you try to, for me?

09:15.305 --> 09:16.890
Ingrid...

09:16.974 --> 09:18.725
Bambi Kannerman.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.938
I don't want a baby.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.983
And I don't want a girlfriend.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.695
What?

09:29.778 --> 09:31.363
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.864
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't...

09:32.948 --> 09:34.574
You-you don't mean that,
and you can't say that, okay?

09:34.658 --> 09:37.286
- Not when I am this close,
damn it.
- This close?

09:37.369 --> 09:39.288
Okay, Nathan, I have felt
more guilty about your death

09:39.371 --> 09:41.873
than you will ever know, but...

09:41.957 --> 09:43.959
I have a surprise
for you.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.253
- Oh, my God. No Brioni
gift card. No Brioni gift card.
- Baby, it's not...

09:46.336 --> 09:47.754
No, no, it's better.
It's better than that, okay?

09:47.838 --> 09:49.256
Nathan...

09:49.339 --> 09:50.799
we have a way out.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.677
I have been growing your body
back to life,

09:53.760 --> 09:55.804
and it is 98% done.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.976
Um...

10:01.059 --> 10:03.103
- What?
- You're welcome.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.272
You can finally download
and come home.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.483
Can't you just picture it?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.193
Holding your mother
in your arms again.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.653
Holding Nevaeh in your arms.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.448
Holding me in your arms.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.034
What are you talking about?
Ingrid, you're dead.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.369
Second surprise.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.204
I'm hug-suiting it, babe.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.040
I have been the whole time.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.920
Look at your face.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.550
Pretty good, huh?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.635
I owe you nothing.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.304
Hmm?

10:38.347 --> 10:39.973
Goodbye.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.683
Wait. What do...

10:41.767 --> 10:43.310
- What do you mean?

10:43.393 --> 10:44.644
Nathan.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.313
Wh-Where are you going?
Will you...

10:46.396 --> 10:47.773
Nathan, come back!

10:51.777 --> 10:54.363
- Can I say something?
- Ivan, look.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.906
You're cool, man. I like you.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.158
- But it's never gonna...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.868
I've actually never been
less attracted to you

10:59.951 --> 11:00.994
than I am right now.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.871
- Wait, what?
- I just want to say

11:02.954 --> 11:05.832
that I admire who you've become,

11:05.916 --> 11:08.085
the leader that
you're turning into.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.087
Oh.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.505
Thanks.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.340
I actually...

11:13.423 --> 11:15.425
I really appreciate that.

11:16.802 --> 11:19.721
Sorry, I thought it was
the other thing.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.349
Yeah, I'm not attracted
to people that I respect.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.684
Like, literally never.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.019
Oh.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.564
I look up to you, Nora.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.900
But I fuck down.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.114
You know, the Roomba's
pretty great, though.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.949
Yeah, Monique is awesome.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.410
Remember, phone stays
in the car.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.416
Antony, we got to go, come on.
We got no time.

11:47.499 --> 11:51.878
Uh... Yeah, just-just one sec.
I-I, um...

11:51.962 --> 11:53.171
It's my sister.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.134
Oh. Uh, yeah, we can wait.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.264
I don't have much time.
What's up?

12:02.347 --> 12:03.932
- It's done.
- What?

12:04.015 --> 12:06.059
Me and Ingrid, okay?
We're done. Finished.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.645
And-and you can believe it,
because, guess what,

12:08.728 --> 12:10.397
- she's not dead.
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.983
Yeah, she's alive, Nora.
Ingrid is alive.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.610
She's-she's been holed up
in a hug suit for months.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.195
- No.
- Yes.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.780
That's so fucked-up.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.240
Right? Thank you.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.908
Oh, and-and there's more.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.577
Okay, they have my body
back in L.A.,

12:23.660 --> 12:25.203
and she's growing
a new head on it

12:25.287 --> 12:27.038
for me to download back into.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.249
Holy shit.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.126
So, I mean...

12:31.209 --> 12:32.794
I have to try.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.629
Wait, what?

12:34.713 --> 12:36.214
You-you can't download, Nathan.

12:36.298 --> 12:37.924
That's insane.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.759
I mean, do you remember
what happened to the last guy?

12:39.843 --> 12:40.844
Remember Rupert?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.304
"Fuck science." Boom.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.306
I mean, people have tattoos
of him exploding.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.640
Yeah, yeah, I know,
but they've been

12:45.724 --> 12:47.309
experimenting successfully
on pigeons.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.352
All right? At least 80 of them
are still alive.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.229
- Out of how many?
- 700.

12:51.313 --> 12:53.690
- 700?
- Yeah, but of those 700,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.775
400 of them made it
at least 24 hours.

12:55.859 --> 12:56.902
That's amazing.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.987
What happens after 24 hours?

13:02.032 --> 13:04.618
Hey, are you okay, little buddy?

13:05.952 --> 13:08.288
Look, you'd be crazy
to download now.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.666
Nora, 24 hours is enough time
for me to use my retinas

13:11.750 --> 13:14.085
- and break into Freeyond.
- No.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.340
- I have to do it.
- No.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.091
No, there's got to be
a better way.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.177
And why would Ingrid
just give us your body?

13:22.260 --> 13:24.012
All right? She'd rather burn it.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.931
Oh, we're gonna have to steal
it, I just don't know how yet.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.098
I know how.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.061
What's up, Nathan?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.812
Come on, Nora. I know
you don't have a sister.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.231
I stalk you on social media.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.774
Hi, Ivan.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.108
Look, there's Ludds
in L.A., too.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.444
If we can get Pastor Rob
on our side,

13:39.528 --> 13:40.820
I think we got this.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.031
- You really think he'd help?
- Positive.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.200
Remember I was gonna be
a lawyer?

13:45.283 --> 13:49.079
I can be pretty persuasive
when I want to be.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.163
How dare you!

13:51.331 --> 13:53.083
Download is worse blasphemy
than upload.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.960
Only one download ever occurred.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.294
And it was Christ our Lord.

13:56.378 --> 13:59.714
And Christians are called upon
to act,

13:59.798 --> 14:01.091
like Christ.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.385
And Nathan is willing to risk
his head exploding

14:03.468 --> 14:05.095
to save the poor.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.847
Do you have any idea
what he's giving up?

14:07.931 --> 14:09.975
I mean, yeah, you call it
blasphemy,

14:10.058 --> 14:12.811
but for the lucky who get
to upload, it is luxury.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.354
And he's tasted it.

14:14.437 --> 14:17.065
I mean, would you leave heaven
to save the rest of us?

14:17.148 --> 14:18.525
I'll come.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.404
Thanks, Rejoyce.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.781
Matteo?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.741
We need your side, too.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.704
I need you.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.289
Please.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.292
You seriously think I'm gonna
help you bring your ex-boyfriend

14:35.375 --> 14:36.668
back to life?

14:36.751 --> 14:38.587
You think I'm that much
of a wilsmith?

14:38.670 --> 14:42.132
So, you only want to help
the masses if I sleep with you?

14:42.215 --> 14:45.510
What? I'm-I'm... No.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.803
That's not... I.. That's...

14:46.886 --> 14:48.430
I didn't say that at all.
You're twisting it.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.099
Mm. Sounds to me
like she got it right.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.559
I...

14:52.642 --> 14:54.936
I would never... That's...

14:55.020 --> 14:56.354
Yeah, I'm not gonna win this.

14:56.438 --> 15:00.025
You win the way we all win:

15:00.108 --> 15:01.318
stopping Freeyond.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.528
We know what to do.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.905
Burn them down.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.657
No.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.868
There are 600 locations
scattered in swing states

15:09.951 --> 15:11.244
and two days left.

15:11.328 --> 15:14.456
We need to knock out
the whole thing all at once.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.291
And to do that,

15:16.374 --> 15:18.793
we have to get Nathan's body
from Los Angeles.

15:18.877 --> 15:22.088
I'll help. Of course I'll help.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.673
Never said I wouldn't.

15:25.508 --> 15:26.968
I have a guy planted
in the Hyperloop.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.553
We can be in L.A. tonight.
How's that?

15:28.637 --> 15:30.805
Hollywood? Take me with you.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.016
Just shut up and dig, Boris.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.606
- You excited for me, Nevaeh?

15:39.689 --> 15:41.608
Tons.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.526
I'll miss you, though.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.862
Aw. Don't.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.406
You're just sending me ahead.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.533
By the time that you're
an old woman,

15:50.617 --> 15:54.037
I will have built a huge house
for our whole family to live in.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.998
Can Uncle Nathan come, too?

15:57.082 --> 15:59.751
Yes, but it's a surprise,

15:59.834 --> 16:01.127
so don't tell him
what I'm doing.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.004
Shouldn't you tell him?

16:03.088 --> 16:05.423
He usually has better instincts
than you.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.717
I will remember that, Nevaeh,

16:07.801 --> 16:11.221
and your digital room
just shrank by a half.

16:21.690 --> 16:22.607
♪ This my house, come on...

16:22.691 --> 16:24.651
Welcome to paradise.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.946
- This is gonna be epic.
- Yeah.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.823
Been here many times.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.741
Little loud.

16:31.825 --> 16:32.909
- Come on, man.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.744
Show me a little respect.
I'm taking you in.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.371
You're right.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.789
I'm sorry. Thank you.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.333
Where can I throw my shoes?

16:40.417 --> 16:42.502
Right, uh, there is fine.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.295
I mean, you know, whatever.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.380
It's chill here.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.466
Um...

16:48.550 --> 16:50.802
Look, there's
something you should know.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.138
I do it, too. It's totally fine.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.973
No. No, not that.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.516
Um...

16:56.599 --> 16:59.060
I might be leaving
sooner than later.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.605
Okay, but you're coming back
for dinner, right?

17:02.689 --> 17:05.358
Because I'm ordering us
some turkey burgers, and...

17:05.442 --> 17:07.402
I have
cookie dough.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.072
That actually sounds
really good,

17:11.156 --> 17:12.574
but, um...

17:12.657 --> 17:14.242
No, I mean, like...

17:14.325 --> 17:16.494
like, leaving-leaving.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.662
I'm downloading.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.585
But...

17:23.668 --> 17:26.087
you're coming back, right?

17:27.130 --> 17:29.007
I don't know.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.637
- [

17:37.849 --> 17:39.768
- God.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.608
Luke.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.841
This is the New York/Los Angeles
3:00 p.m. Hyperloop.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.927
Next stop, Indianapolis.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.184
What are we gonna do
for four hours?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.770
I don't know, maybe we could,
uh...

18:24.938 --> 18:26.981
...you know, go over a few
things in our relationship.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.652
Try to figure out
what went wrong.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.779
- Ooh, there's Wi-Fi.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.365
...15.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.700
- Yes.
- Oh.

18:39.202 --> 18:42.497
I'll talk to you
about your relationship, bro.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.166
What's your favorite fetish?

18:48.044 --> 18:50.630
Okay, I meet them
in the Grey Zone, right?

18:50.713 --> 18:52.048
Did you tell Luke?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.550
Yeah. There was a lot of crying.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.802
The program was literally
running out of tissues.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.804
Shh. We're right outside.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.640
Excuse me. Hi,
there's some dick outside

19:00.723 --> 19:01.850
spray-painting the wall
right now.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.059
I just thought you should know.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.310
Yeah, like, right now.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.277
- Hi. Hands up. Move back.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.612
Keep going. On the floor.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.282
- Wait, you're the dick?
- Just get on the floor.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.158
Good. You're doing great.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.285
Tie him up.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.340
Hey, a bunch of these
are upside down.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.843
Look, Nathan, help me find
which ass is yours.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.095
Well, it's very tight.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.513
Pretty toned.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.515
At least it was,
the last time I saw it.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.100
Probably still is, right?

19:45.560 --> 19:47.353
No, that's not it.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.607
Oh, God. Please don't be me.
Please don't be me.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.983
No, that's not me.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.946
Aw, come on, Nora.
That's not mine.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.615
- Baby.
- Shh.
- What?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.867
- Baby, hi, baby.
- Can't you hear that?

20:00.950 --> 20:02.785
That noise, where do I know
that noise from?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.329
You're all done now.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.165
Let me get those tubes for you,
all nice and comfy.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.834
Huh? I brought a present
for you, Brownie.

20:09.918 --> 20:13.671
That's right.
Are you so excited, baby?

20:13.755 --> 20:15.423
They're Brioni.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.133
They're your favorite.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.260
We're gonna be together
again, okay?

20:19.344 --> 20:21.262
Just you and me.
Does that make you happy?

20:21.346 --> 20:22.639
Yeah?

20:22.722 --> 20:23.932
I just have to move you
in case they come

20:24.015 --> 20:25.266
and try and take you from me.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.809
Oh, God.
Your abs have gotten so flabby

20:26.893 --> 20:28.728
- since you've been
in this tub.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.146
Ingrid, no.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.773
Norma?

20:31.856 --> 20:32.941
What the hell
are you doing here?

20:33.024 --> 20:34.442
Look, I-I met you six times,

20:34.525 --> 20:36.611
but my-my name is Nora.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.781
- Yeah, from impact yoga, right?
- What? No, no.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.991
Ingrid, just please step away
from Nathan's body.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.993
- It's an emergency.
- Uh-uh.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.621
No. Nathan is mine, okay?

20:46.704 --> 20:48.873
Why, why can't you
understand that?

20:48.957 --> 20:51.209
It is not that hard to get,
Nara.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.836
Ingrid, look,
Nathan needs to download now,

20:53.920 --> 20:55.463
or millions
of real people's lives

20:55.546 --> 20:57.256
are gonna be in real danger.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.758
No, you're lying.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.386
- Just get away from us, okay?
- Hey.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.887
We got to go.
What's the holdup?

21:02.971 --> 21:09.268
He is all I have...!

21:10.269 --> 21:11.521
Good Lord.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.274
Hey, wait.
No, no, don't pull that!

21:15.358 --> 21:16.859
The computer's still controlling
his life functions

21:16.943 --> 21:18.695
because the head is empty.
If she pulls that out...

21:18.778 --> 21:19.904
Matteo, put the gun down now.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.865
Hey, Ingrid.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.617
Look, I'm not,
I'm not judging you.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.454
You grew up with wealth
a-and beauty.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.581
And people think your life is
full of happiness.

21:30.665 --> 21:33.543
They don't know
that you worked hard for it.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.544
But I know.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.839
I see a woman with great heart

21:37.922 --> 21:40.133
who really cares about Nathan

21:40.216 --> 21:41.843
and-and wants him to be happy.

21:41.926 --> 21:46.097
You're an amazing person
who will find true love one day,

21:46.180 --> 21:50.059
a love that'll seem easy
and not hard work.

21:50.143 --> 21:53.646
Look, I see that coming for you,
Ingrid Kannerman.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.815
- But right-right now,
i-in this moment,

21:55.898 --> 21:57.567
we-we need your help.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.277
Please, please, look,
it-it's not...

21:59.360 --> 22:01.821
it's not for me or anyone here.

22:01.904 --> 22:03.823
There are good people
that are in harm's way

22:03.906 --> 22:05.992
from some greedy,
powerful people

22:06.075 --> 22:08.745
that I think you know.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.705
But I know you.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.874
You're a good one

22:12.957 --> 22:15.334
who will help us, so...

22:15.418 --> 22:18.838
so help us bring Nathan Brown
back to life,

22:18.921 --> 22:21.632
back to us and back to you.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.845
The real you.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.764
Not-not this you.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.318
You're good.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.036
- Nathan.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.913
It's time.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.414
The Grey Zone.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.540
Now.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.503
Ow.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.968
All right.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.763
Wow, good for you.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.397
- Need help?
- Nope.

23:18.481 --> 23:19.732
I got it.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.902
You sure?

23:22.985 --> 23:24.112
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

23:24.195 --> 23:25.988
Just got to get
a different angle here.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.535
There we go.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.417
Nora.

23:38.501 --> 23:39.418
What's happening?

23:39.502 --> 23:41.129
Give it to me straight.

23:41.212 --> 23:43.005
How are my abs looking?

23:43.089 --> 23:44.465
- All right.
- Oh!

23:44.549 --> 23:45.550
New approach.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.386
Is he okay?
It sounds like he needs help.

23:48.469 --> 23:49.762
Somebody should probably
help him.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.348
I'm good.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.351
Okay, I need help.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.353
- I need help.
- Okay, Grey Zone's ahead.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.773
Hey! Hey, no!
You cannot go there!

24:00.857 --> 24:03.442
Sorry, I don't think so.

24:03.526 --> 24:05.069
You're not allowed in that area.

24:05.153 --> 24:07.155
Hey, hey! No!

24:07.238 --> 24:08.364
It's cool, buddy. It's all good.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.907
It's good.
I'm with him.

24:09.991 --> 24:11.868
Wait, what?
Who the fuck are you?

24:11.951 --> 24:13.578
My name is Boris Netherlands.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.163
I'm here to save your life.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.039
We got to get to
the Grey Zone download

24:17.123 --> 24:18.416
before the system knows
we're missing.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.168
And scene.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.426
Hello,
I'm Officer Jennifer Garner,

24:28.509 --> 24:30.928
an automated system with
the voice of Jennifer Garner

24:31.012 --> 24:32.763
that can handle
complete emergencies.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.807
- Your call is very important
to us,

24:34.891 --> 24:37.351
and it will be recorded to
help us catch whoever is doing

24:37.435 --> 24:38.895
whatever to you now.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.396
Let's start with your location.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.024
Oprime numero dos para español.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.358
Help!

24:50.948 --> 24:52.450
I can't believe
this is happening.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.993
Well, believe it.

24:56.787 --> 24:58.039
Hey.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.875
- Can I watch from over there?
- Yeah.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.585
Do you want to get, like,
some drinks after that, maybe?

25:02.668 --> 25:04.045
- Don't even.
- That was a bad time, right?

25:04.128 --> 25:06.005
- God.
- Yeah, sorry.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.591
Okay. We're ready.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.092
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, wait.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.552
He's not balanced on the chair.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.679
Nora, grab his arm.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.607
Everything set?

25:26.525 --> 25:27.735
Do it.

25:29.237 --> 25:31.447
- In three... Two...

25:31.530 --> 25:33.241
- One.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.330
I got him.

25:39.413 --> 25:40.873
I got him.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.418
Shit, I lost him.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.339
I can't find
his consciousness now.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.882
I... I just had it here.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.550
- Damn it.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.346
Find it.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.517
He should've woken up by now.
Goddamn it.

26:11.362 --> 26:14.031
Piece of cake.

26:36.679 --> 26:37.638
Um...

26:37.722 --> 26:39.348
Hello, boyfriend.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.850
I'm sorry, that-that's not fair.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.853
You did dump me this morning.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.397
I can see you've
really gotten over it.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.235
Ingrid.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.993
All I ever wanted was for you to
look at me like you look at her.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.792
Ingrid, I'm sorry.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.756
Thank you.

27:22.475 --> 27:25.936
You take real good care
of this client.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.897
Okay? I'll pay extra.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.150
We got to go, right now.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.902
Come on.

27:36.989 --> 27:41.160
- I'm so sorry.
- Seriously? Wait, I...

27:44.163 --> 27:45.706
But didn't he just download?

27:45.790 --> 27:48.959
Just in case! Okay?
Just in case.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.551
All right.

28:21.158 --> 28:22.952
All right, we got
three compartments

28:23.035 --> 28:24.829
back to New York, so, Nora,

28:24.912 --> 28:27.873
I figured you share with Rejoyce
and I'll bunk with Nathan.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.376
Uh...

28:32.211 --> 28:33.754
Just kidding.

28:33.838 --> 28:36.465
- You guys take, uh,
compartment three.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.934
Oh, um...

28:47.017 --> 28:49.728
You can have the bed,
I'll, uh, take the floor.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.400
Nobody bought that.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.776
Probably not.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.156
So...

29:02.283 --> 29:03.659
Here we are.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.203
Yeah.

29:06.287 --> 29:09.415
I've been dreaming about this,

29:09.498 --> 29:13.586
and now that it's here, I'm...

29:13.669 --> 29:15.588
I'm a little nervous.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.631
What happens in your dream?

29:18.799 --> 29:20.759
Well...

29:23.053 --> 29:27.141
You start by standing
really close to me

29:27.224 --> 29:29.643
and looking at me really softly.

29:29.727 --> 29:32.271
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, like that.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.106
And, um...

29:34.190 --> 29:36.984
and then you lean into me.

29:37.067 --> 29:39.069
I like that. Just like that.

29:39.153 --> 29:40.446
That's nice.

29:40.529 --> 29:43.824
And then you turn into
my eighth grade algebra teacher.

29:43.908 --> 29:46.327
It gets really weird, I know.
And then you fall into a ditch.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.412
I've just really been...

29:50.789 --> 29:52.541
Mmm.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.051
You smell amazing.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.844
I had no idea.

30:03.928 --> 30:07.932
I smelled your T-shirt, so...

30:08.015 --> 30:10.851
I kind of knew this would work.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.313
How is this gonna work?

30:15.773 --> 30:18.692
Um... maybe there?

30:23.948 --> 30:26.242
- Oh.
- Mm.

30:30.704 --> 30:33.666
Oh. Well, that's narrow.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.793
Uh, well, I mean, I could...

30:35.876 --> 30:38.379
sleep on the floor for real,
if you want.

30:38.462 --> 30:39.922
Oh, don't be an idiot.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.591
I'm not missing out on this.

30:45.803 --> 30:50.099
Just means we'll have to lie
right on top of each other.

30:50.182 --> 30:54.645
That is a sacrifice
that I am willing to make.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.488
Oh, my T-shirt.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.458
Wait, am I too heavy?

31:16.542 --> 31:17.710
No.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.545
Not even a little.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.263
All right, wait. Are my knees...
are my knees poking you?

31:29.346 --> 31:31.015
- If they're,
if they're sharp...
- No.

31:31.098 --> 31:33.892
I love your knees.
Your knees are the best.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.532
Is this okay?

31:50.784 --> 31:52.703
It's not too awkward?

31:54.163 --> 31:55.748
No, it's perfect.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.918
Yeah.

32:17.728 --> 32:20.272
I am a fruit that grows
on a tree.

32:20.356 --> 32:22.358
Finish my letters
and you'll spell me!

32:22.441 --> 32:25.444
God, wake me the fuck up
right now!

32:28.447 --> 32:29.948
Lucy.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.201
- You have a second?
- What's up?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.995
I thought about it,
and I want to choose...

32:35.079 --> 32:36.705
the apartment.

32:36.789 --> 32:39.458
New world, new street,
new foods.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.085
You know what this means, right?

32:41.168 --> 32:43.712
Leeshy's on Horizen's
golden leash?

32:44.838 --> 32:46.840
Leeshy's on the leash.

32:46.924 --> 32:49.385
Yay! We're gonna have
dinner parties,

32:49.468 --> 32:51.178
and I'll introduce you
to everybody on the block.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.180
It's really a terrific block.

32:53.263 --> 32:56.684
- And we'll turn you
into the new me...!

33:01.271 --> 33:02.439
Oh, okay.

33:14.535 --> 33:15.786
Batia.

33:17.621 --> 33:20.249
Hey, so I usually start my day
by checking in on Mr. Brown.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.710
Nathan. Nothing weird.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.336
It's not like I'm obsessed
with him or anything.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.839
That would be
inappropriate.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.674
Or would it, though,
do you think?

33:29.883 --> 33:31.635
Anyway, um, he's nowhere
in the system,

33:31.719 --> 33:33.053
and, um...

33:33.137 --> 33:34.847
there's no record of him
ever leaving.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.682
He fell in a glitch.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.101
Okay. What do I do?

33:39.184 --> 33:43.063
Restart from auto-backup
and don't tell anyone.

33:43.147 --> 33:45.357
Okay.

34:18.098 --> 34:21.018
Ah, don't worry, Brownie.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.895
It's gonna take us
a tiny bit longer

34:22.978 --> 34:26.690
than we expected,
but I'm a really good mommy,

34:26.774 --> 34:28.650
and I've got you.

34:28.734 --> 34:32.196
And nobody is gonna stop us.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.033
Especially Norma.

35:34.883 --> 35:39.555
This is so stupid.

35:39.638 --> 35:43.308
You did it. Yay! Go you!

35:43.392 --> 35:45.185
Mm-hmm.

35:46.728 --> 35:50.107
I'm purple, tasty, sweet, yum.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.901
I'm not a peach, but I'm a...

35:54.361 --> 35:56.488
Plue?

35:56.572 --> 35:58.699
"Ploot"?

35:58.782 --> 36:01.285
"Ploom." Ploom?

36:01.368 --> 36:03.036
- Skip.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.747
I'm curved, yellow and long.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.083
Eat me up and stay very strong.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.963
I believe...

36:14.298 --> 36:17.759
- Bingo! Yeah!

36:20.220 --> 36:23.891
- Ho!
