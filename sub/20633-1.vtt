01:20.360 --> 01:22.840
Are you international
superstar Barbara Windsor?

01:23.600 --> 01:24.931
Get stuffed.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.410
What are you doing on the floor?

01:27.720 --> 01:29.449
The four poster was taken.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.684
I've got a couple of hours between
the matinee and the evening,

01:36.880 --> 01:38.405
thought I'd get some kip.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.641
Have you eaten?

01:41.920 --> 01:44.526
You need to take better care of yourself.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.245
I'm alright.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.641
Do you want me to get you something
before you go back on?

01:49.120 --> 01:50.167
Yeah.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.011
What d'you fancy?

01:55.240 --> 02:00.201
A nice steak. Medium rare, side salad,
new potatoes. And a glass of champagne.

02:00.960 --> 02:05.488
How about I go and see if they've fixed the
car, then grab fish and chips on the way back?

02:06.240 --> 02:07.526
Perfect.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.931
It'll be okay...

02:11.400 --> 02:12.811
everything will be alright.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.809
Bet the press can't believe their luck,

02:16.680 --> 02:18.091
another divorce,

02:18.360 --> 02:20.328
end of the pier one nighters,

02:21.440 --> 02:23.090
new no'; WY"...

02:23.360 --> 02:25.124
Let 'em think what they like.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.282
You and me is all that matters...

02:29.000 --> 02:30.650
You be okay 'til I get back?

02:31.640 --> 02:32.801
Course.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.806
Made a right old mess of
things haven't you love?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.968
Not exactly the West End is it.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.006
Not funny though dad, look at me.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.965
Knocking sixty.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.722
Another marriage down the toilet.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.646
Skim.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.369
Sitting here talking to myself.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.840
When you got yourself into trouble
when you were little?

04:04.920 --> 04:06.445
What did I tell you?

04:06.600 --> 04:10.161
Take some time... Think
through what happened,

04:10.320 --> 04:13.961
go back over everything... Work out
what you did wrong.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.248
And don't do it again.

04:16.399 --> 04:19.721
Take a deep breath and you will be
crossing over to...

04:19.880 --> 04:22.611
the sunny side of the street...
job done.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.608
Sometimes it's not that easy Dad.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.561
Hey, that's your Mother talking...

04:43.960 --> 04:45.371
Barbara Deeks.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.961
Grab your coat and get your hat,

04:55.320 --> 04:58.847
Leave your worry on the doorstep.

04:59.080 --> 05:04.041
Just direct your feet.
to the sunny side of the street.

05:04.160 --> 05:11.044
I used to walk in the shade
with those blues on parade.

05:11.160 --> 05:17.361
But I'm not afraid,
because I'm a Rover crossed over.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.763
If I never have a cent

05:20.880 --> 05:24.407
I'd be rich as Rockefeller.

05:24.520 --> 05:30.527
Gold dust at my feet,
on the sunny side of the street.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.326
Was I alright?

05:45.480 --> 05:47.369
Why did you do a cartwheel?

05:48.840 --> 05:50.604
I thought it was fun.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.762
Was it your Father's idea?

05:54.960 --> 05:55.960
Come on.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.245
What did I tell you?

06:39.640 --> 06:42.450
Take some time... Think
through what happened,

06:42.600 --> 06:46.525
go back over everything... Work out
what you did wrong.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.160
And don't do it again.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.241
Bye!

08:18.760 --> 08:20.762
Bye darling.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.850
Will Daddy know where I am?

08:48.240 --> 08:50.208
I'll write and tell him.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.200
Now,

08:52.760 --> 08:54.410
remember what I told you,

08:54.560 --> 08:56.927
speak nicely to the people you stay with.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.200
I will.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.729
Broke my heart sending you away.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.562
That dirty old man touched me.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.924
Yeah... You didn't ought
to send her off like that.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.160
We got her moved to the Norths as
soon as we found out, they were lovely...

10:11.200 --> 10:12.856
You still had no right sending her away.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.089
How would you know what I should have done
or not done, you weren't there!

10:16.240 --> 10:19.562
No, I was fighting a war wasn't I!

10:19.720 --> 10:21.245
And they were dropping bombs on us.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.004
Didn't hit you though.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.456
You should have kept her with you!

10:24.480 --> 10:25.527
Stop it.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.856
They evacuated all the children.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.880
Not all of 'em.
I did what I thought was best john.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.367
What's best for you, you mean!

10:32.520 --> 10:33.931
Stop it! Both of you!

10:43.160 --> 10:44.685
What you doin' love?

10:48.320 --> 10:49.320
Don't know...

10:52.280 --> 10:53.805
just working things out.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.405
Trying to make sense of it.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.407
And you need me to do that?

11:04.960 --> 11:06.246
I always needed you.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.648
We both loved you...

11:12.760 --> 11:15.001
just had different ways of
showing it that's all...

11:18.960 --> 11:21.804
Not my fault she was a miserable cow.

11:25.800 --> 11:26.847
That's better.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.367
Sometimes a song would come on the radio

11:34.440 --> 11:35.965
and you'd scoop me up,

11:38.120 --> 11:39.884
twirl me round the room,

11:40.520 --> 11:42.170
singing and dancing...

11:45.080 --> 11:47.082
I'd see Mum watching us...

11:47.240 --> 11:49.481
all the worries of the
world on her shoulders,

11:49.640 --> 11:52.246
Like she had two kids to take care
of instead of one...

11:52.520 --> 11:55.808
She didn't have to be so serious
all the time, going on at you...

11:56.680 --> 11:58.456
She didn't want you doing all your
singing and dancing.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.244
She wanted what was best for me is all.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.006
There was that talent scout bloke,

12:03.160 --> 12:03.968
Brian Mickey...

12:04.080 --> 12:04.763
He said...

12:04.880 --> 12:06.723
She's really got something Mrs Deeks.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.880
I have no intention of putting my
daughter on the stage thank you very much,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.970
she's won a scholarship,
with the highest marks in North London.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.691
She's going to be a foreign
language telephonist.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.251
First I'd heard of it!
See?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.323
She changed her mind though!

12:20.160 --> 12:22.049
Wonder why that was?

12:22.800 --> 12:24.802
She talks about nothing else...

12:28.200 --> 12:31.647
Do you remember Aida Foster, head of
my first drama school?

12:31.800 --> 12:33.040
Should do. Cost me enough.

12:33.200 --> 12:37.728
Well Mrs Deeks... Your daughter isn't the usual
little lady we have coming through our doors.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.850
She's different. But we all think she's got
something...

12:41.000 --> 12:42.411
Here we go again...

12:42.560 --> 12:46.963
We don't know what it is, but
she definitely has.. Something.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.964
Mary keep those arms up.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.925
They all said that...

12:53.080 --> 12:55.924
But whatever it was, it
got me a lot of work.

12:56.080 --> 13:00.005
And up and smile and up.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.046
Next!

13:05.440 --> 13:06.601
Next!

13:10.320 --> 13:11.320
Next!

13:14.760 --> 13:15.807
Next!

13:20.400 --> 13:22.164
She's got... Something?

13:24.480 --> 13:26.244
You had something else.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.722
You had my name!

13:32.720 --> 13:36.167
Look at this, you've got
this from your Father...

13:36.440 --> 13:39.887
Nine hairs and a nit... It's too
thin to do anything with.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.096
Sorry Mum.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.681
Don't be sorry... Not your fault.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.968
I just wish you had my hair that's all...

13:47.360 --> 13:50.648
Truth is I'm not sure your Father
has got anything worth passing on.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.928
I've got his laugh too.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.844
Don't remind me.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.804
Talking of things you've inherited
from your Father...

13:59.920 --> 14:02.526
This play Mrs Foster wants you to do.

14:02.680 --> 14:03.966
Love PW“ MY!

14:04.120 --> 14:07.176
Well you'll be travelling all round the
country, it will be your first big part.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.247
I know.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.407
And Mrs Foster doesn't think
Barbara Deeks is a very good stage name.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.846
Why not?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.047
It just isn't.

14:16.920 --> 14:20.606
She says Barbara is alright, it's
just Deeks you'll have to change.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.080
Change my name?
Lots of people do it.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.249
But what would Daddy say?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.528
Do you want to be on the stage or not?

14:30.680 --> 14:32.170
Yes.

14:32.960 --> 14:37.124
Then the money we're paying this Mrs Foster,
don't you think we should listen to her?

14:37.280 --> 14:38.327
I suppose.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.931
It'd just be like your
professional name is all.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.051
Like Veronica Lake.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.451
Isn't that her name then?

14:49.600 --> 14:54.242
No, she was born Constance Ockelman,

14:55.840 --> 14:58.081
I read it in a magazine, only last week.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.123
So it'd only be like a professional name?

15:02.400 --> 15:04.050
That should be all right, shouldn't it?

15:04.560 --> 15:06.085
Daddy wouldn't mind that?

15:06.840 --> 15:09.684
It's up to him what he minds and
what he doesn't.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.561
This is about what's best for you.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.247
So,

15:14.520 --> 15:15.931
what should I change it to?

15:16.560 --> 15:17.846
I thought,

15:18.000 --> 15:19.889
about Ellis... my maiden name.

15:20.840 --> 15:21.840
Ellis...

15:22.760 --> 15:28.369
Either that or with it being Coronation year,
you could use Aunt Dolly's married name.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Windsor.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.090
Barbara Windsor.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.805
She hated you having my laugh,

15:41.080 --> 15:42.605
having my hair.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.530
Anything that reminded her of me...

15:47.920 --> 15:50.287
Couldn't do much about
any of them, could she?

15:50.440 --> 15:52.090
It was Mrs Foster's idea.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.526
Course it was.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.009
I was still your little girl...

16:03.480 --> 16:05.244
Walking away again Dad?

16:07.560 --> 16:08.971
Hello!

16:09.120 --> 16:11.726
Did Mrs Foster get you a return ticket?

16:11.880 --> 16:14.008
In my pocket.
Well make sure you don't lose it!

16:15.720 --> 16:18.644
The judge will ask you some
questions about your Father

16:18.800 --> 16:21.883
and we need you to answer them as honestly
as you are able.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.011
Can you do that?

16:25.160 --> 16:26.321
I'll try.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.364
Good girl.

16:57.360 --> 17:00.887
Can someone find something for
Barbara Ann to stand on,

17:01.240 --> 17:04.084
I think it's much better if we can see her.

17:08.760 --> 17:09.840
That's better.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.406
Are you alright Barbara Ann?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.011
Yes thank you.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.044
Now I'm going to ask you some questions.

17:17.240 --> 17:23.327
No-one is going to get into any trouble, we're just
trying to work out what's best for you and your parents,

17:24.160 --> 17:25.400
Barbara.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.402
Have you ever seen your parents arguing?

17:29.600 --> 17:30.840
Yes.

17:31.200 --> 17:36.161
And have you ever heard
your Father swearing?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.121
Yes.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.488
Do you remember what words he used?

17:49.320 --> 17:53.769
You don't have to say them out
loud, you can write them down.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.404
Did you ever see your
Father lose his temper?

18:41.360 --> 18:42.600
Sometimes.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.086
With you?
No.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.440
With your Mother?

18:49.720 --> 18:50.801
Yes.

18:51.160 --> 18:56.121
Can you tell me the kind of thing
he'd do when he lost his temper?

19:00.760 --> 19:04.731
If you want to go for a walk, go for
a walk with your coat in the gutter!

19:21.960 --> 19:24.804
How are we going to put food on
the table?

19:31.040 --> 19:36.922
And did you ever see your Father
hit your Mother?

19:52.040 --> 19:53.280
Yes.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.009
Well done girls!

20:30.320 --> 20:31.890
There's other things too...

20:32.080 --> 20:35.971
It's alright Barbara Ann, you've
told us what we needed to know.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.884
Well done.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.200
Well done Barbara.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.446
Is that it?

20:53.120 --> 20:54.360
Ye?“.

20:54.840 --> 20:58.526
It's all over. Daddy and I
aren't together any more,

20:59.200 --> 21:01.043
but the judge said you can live with me.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.765
Just you?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Yes,

21:04.920 --> 21:08.481
but you can still see him once
a week and he'll pay for your keep.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.324
But I didn't tell them everything.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.204
You told them just what you needed to.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.525
Here's Daddy!

21:39.040 --> 21:41.441
Don't worry about your Father, you
know what he's like.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.045
He wouldn't even look at me.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.927
It will all be for the best.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.807
Now, chin up,

21:49.560 --> 21:51.244
you've got a show to do.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.971
Come on, or you'll miss it...

22:27.320 --> 22:29.721
They said I had to tell the truth.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.282
I thought they'd ask me about Mum as well,

22:35.720 --> 22:36.846
but they didn't.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.764
I know she put you up to it.
Oh and none of it was your fault?

22:41.440 --> 22:43.568
It wasn't you who did all those things?

22:47.840 --> 22:49.604
Daddy!

22:51.240 --> 22:52.810
I'm sorry.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.050
I was angry.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.490
You know what I'm like.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.803
There was only one place in the
world where people seemed happy to see me.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.441
People to tell me I was doing alright...

23:25.800 --> 23:27.131
Thousands of 'em.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.325
Every night.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.325
But never you.

23:41.400 --> 23:47.169
Grab your coat and get your hat...
Leave your worries on the doorstep...

23:47.280 --> 23:48.611
I saw you once...

24:20.320 --> 24:22.322
You didn't ought to have done that Daddy...

24:22.440 --> 24:26.126
Work so hard to make me your little girl.
Not if you were going.

24:28.080 --> 24:31.368
Leaving a ruddy big hole I'd spend the rest
of my life trying to fill.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.968
Big shoes eh love?

24:50.640 --> 24:58.445
Playing the clown,
trying to drown all of my woes,

25:01.480 --> 25:05.485
You know they will all
turn out alright,

25:06.880 --> 25:11.841
If I keep painting the clouds

25:12.080 --> 25:14.162
with sunshine.

25:16.680 --> 25:20.526
Painting all the
clouds with sunshine.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.881
Hello again. You obviously like my
number, you watch it every night.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.887
I think it's wonderful Mr Brandon.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.690
Well that's very sweet of you.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.729
Think he was my first crush.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.047
He was queer as a nine bob note.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.168
Don't knock it 'til you've tried it dear.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.767
You grew into a pretty little thing...

26:04.280 --> 26:07.887
Boys must've been like
bees round a honey pot.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.646
People did keep telling
me I had 'something'

26:10.800 --> 26:15.408
As I got older boys clearly thought so too cos they
always seemed to be fumbling around looking for it.

26:15.680 --> 26:19.366
It was them boobs of yours, gawd
knows where you got them from.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.369
Wasn't your Mother.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.727
Well I must have got 'em from somewhere.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.971
Barbara Windsor!

26:26.200 --> 26:28.089
The Director says your tits are too big!

26:28.200 --> 26:30.726
He wants 'em strapped up, put this on.

26:44.800 --> 26:49.124
The good thing was, that once I worked out
what boys wanted, it came in very handy.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.442
'Specially between acting jobs.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.729
Well you haven't exactly got many
qualifications have you?

26:55.840 --> 26:57.729
Well I've been working as an actress.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.769
Then why do you want to
work in a shoe shop?

26:59.880 --> 27:03.168
I'm in-between parts...
I'll work really hard.

27:03.600 --> 27:07.082
You'll have to memorize all the
shoes, learn about sizes.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.890
Oh I'm used to learning lines.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.522
And have you done any selling?

27:13.200 --> 27:15.601
Oh yes... Loads'.!

27:16.600 --> 27:17.931
Liar.

27:21.680 --> 27:23.762
Would you like to try them on?
Ta.

27:36.680 --> 27:40.366
I think you should get them love.
You sure? They're really dear.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.251
Oh, I'm sure he can afford it...
Can't you darlin'...?

27:51.560 --> 27:53.130
I wasn't a flirt,

27:53.480 --> 27:59.089
not really, I just learnt that most men are so full
of 'emselves, they think you fancy them anyway...

27:59.200 --> 28:00.884
I just didn't tell 'em any different...

28:01.040 --> 28:04.726
Trouble with blokes is, you let 'em think
they can and they won't leave you alone.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.530
Voice of experience Dad?

28:06.680 --> 28:10.685
I'm Peter Noble, you're
very cute in this show,

28:10.920 --> 28:13.526
I'm producing a film, I
could write you in it.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.250
Course you could.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.488
My name is Monsieur
Vincent, I am from Paris.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.484
Course he is.
Course you are.

28:19.640 --> 28:23.645
You have a beautiful singing voice,
I wish for you to sing in my revue.

28:27.280 --> 28:30.887
I'm Peter Charlesworth, I'm a song
plugger but I'm setting up as an agent.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.082
I'd like to handle you.
I bet he would.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.486
I bet you would.

28:34.720 --> 28:38.008
I'm Ronnie Scott. 'Course you are.
No I am. Really.

28:38.360 --> 28:43.924
I need a new singer for my club... And
you... Little one. You've got... Something.

29:02.480 --> 29:06.610
I've never wanted wealth untold,

29:06.720 --> 29:10.725
My life as one design.

29:10.880 --> 29:15.283
A simple little band of gold,

29:15.440 --> 29:19.570
to prove that you are mine.

29:19.680 --> 29:23.924
Don't want the world to have and hold,

29:24.160 --> 29:27.960
for fame is not my line.

29:28.320 --> 29:32.325
Just want a little band of gold,

29:32.560 --> 29:37.202
to prove that you are mine.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.490
Some sail away

29:40.680 --> 29:42.808
to Araby

29:43.000 --> 29:46.800
and other lands of mystery,

29:47.200 --> 29:51.330
but all the wonders that they see

29:51.680 --> 29:54.331
will never tempt me.

29:54.520 --> 29:58.684
Their memories will soon grow cold,

29:59.040 --> 30:02.840
but till the end of time.

30:03.040 --> 30:07.364
There'll be a little band of gold,

30:07.560 --> 30:12.043
to prove that you are mine.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.770
Bloody musicians.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.770
Oh, I loved Ronnie.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.440
He used to take me to a little flat
above a salt beef shop.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.927
Like I said... bloody musicians.

30:45.960 --> 30:50.921
I'm fed up with you wasting your time and your talent
Barbara darling... Singing at all these clubs...

30:51.320 --> 30:53.288
But I like singing Peter.

30:53.640 --> 30:54.971
Magician's assistant!

30:55.160 --> 30:56.969
I really liked that job.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.970
Everyone could see you.
What?

30:59.160 --> 31:01.976
In the box. You were supposed to disappear.
Everyone could see your bum.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.809
And your foot was sticking out the bottom.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.650
Well they didn't train me properly.

31:05.840 --> 31:08.161
You were bloody awful and do you know why?

31:08.360 --> 31:09.168
Why?

31:09.360 --> 31:13.331
Because you're not a magician's
assistant.. You're an actress!

31:13.520 --> 31:15.841
Then get me an acting job.
I have.

31:16.520 --> 31:22.163
I have. You start in The Gimmick with Bernard Braden and Barbara
Kelly, two months on tour then straight into the west end.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.005
Big stars they were.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.531
It was a big break.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.360
You're sacked.
Eh?

31:28.720 --> 31:34.363
Reviews are in. Barbara number
two, out acts Barbara number one!

31:39.920 --> 31:40.920
Hi,

31:41.080 --> 31:43.560
I'm Slim Cattan, I'm a film producer.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.728
'Course he is.
'Course you are.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.729
There's a great little part for you.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.729
You'll have to talk to my agent.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.251
I'll do that.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.771
All these blokes wanting something.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.727
I didn't know who to trust.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.651
And that was all my fault was it?
No...

32:06.600 --> 32:08.284
Well maybe a bit.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.408
When I was little you
always made me feel safe

32:12.680 --> 32:16.002
I suppose part of me was looking
for someone else to do that, that's all.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.203
You did a lot of looking.

32:18.480 --> 32:22.087
Oi. There wasn't that many blokes.
There wasn't!

32:28.640 --> 32:30.290
That's not funny.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.490
Sorry.

32:43.640 --> 32:46.530
Did you go and ask about that job I
told you about darlin'?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.684
I was busy.

32:49.960 --> 32:53.282
I put in a word for you, all you
had to do was turn up.

33:20.920 --> 33:23.321
He was bad news.

33:24.320 --> 33:28.882
Maybe... But not all of 'em were.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.646
Alright Neil?
Yeah mate.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.046
Aren't you going to introduce me to
this pretty lady?

33:39.320 --> 33:41.496
Who you calling pretty?
You.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.887
You must want your eyes testing, I
ain't got any make up on.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.767
You're still pretty.
Watch him Babs, he's after something.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.441
Ain't they all?
I am after something as it goes.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.087
What?
Your number.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.003
I'll think about it.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.411
Ronnie.

34:07.640 --> 34:11.485
She said she'll be home by eleven,
you can call her then.

34:20.719 --> 34:25.681
Ronnie.
Stan. How's jenny and the kids?

34:26.040 --> 34:28.440
Eating me out of house and home.
Give Jen my best eh?

34:30.159 --> 34:32.322
Alright Ron.
Billy.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.208
Mr Knight.
Frank.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.123
You've got a lot of friends.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.531
I'm a very friendly fella.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.201
Remind you of anyone?

34:59.440 --> 35:03.286
Thank you, I had a lovely evening.
Me too.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.689
Can we do it again?
I'd like that.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.444
WW...

35:14.720 --> 35:16.370
WW...

36:03.600 --> 36:05.523
You know he's married?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.650
What?

36:09.160 --> 36:11.083
With a daughter

36:11.600 --> 36:13.728
and a baby on the way!

36:16.680 --> 36:21.208
I just want to talk to her.
She doesn't want to see you.

36:22.240 --> 36:26.211
I need to explain.
Shouldn't you be explaining to your wife?

36:26.320 --> 36:29.085
It's not what you think.
Oh it's exactly what I think.

36:29.240 --> 36:30.924
Now out you go! Out!

36:33.160 --> 36:34.321
Barb,

36:34.600 --> 36:37.206
just let me talk to you!

36:42.840 --> 36:45.684
The least I could do was give him a
chance to explain.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.649
Your life.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.361
I met June when we were at school,

36:56.640 --> 36:59.246
she got pregnant so I married her...

36:59.520 --> 37:03.127
Ain't much of a marriage. We live
separate lives...

37:04.600 --> 37:07.729
I was gonna tell
you I swear I was...

37:11.880 --> 37:15.487
I'll get a divorce, prove it to you.

37:16.720 --> 37:20.088
I don't want you doing that, what
about your kids?

37:20.360 --> 37:22.010
I'll see they're alright.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.810
I don't know Ronnie...

37:28.840 --> 37:30.251
Look,

37:30.760 --> 37:34.367
I'm with you or not,
I'm still not gonna be with her.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.007
It's over between us.

37:37.760 --> 37:40.650
I wanna be with you.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.211
Well don't look at me.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.761
Can I trust you?

38:31.040 --> 38:34.010
I'll never let you down, I promise.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.731
You're not hiding anything else?
Nothing.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.367
No more surprises?
No.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.325
I swear to God.

38:58.160 --> 39:03.121
Don't tell me you didn't see
that coming love. I didn't.

39:03.480 --> 39:04.891
He swore he was innocent.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.571
I'm innocent Barb,

39:07.120 --> 39:09.009
I swear it.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.442
Fifteen months.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.089
Wait for me!

39:14.360 --> 39:15.771
Come along!
Yeah, alright!

39:17.280 --> 39:19.886
Slim Cattan, film producer.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.322
We met a month or so back.

39:22.600 --> 39:27.561
I said I was making a movie and there was a great little
part for you and you said I should speak to your agent.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.082
Oh, that's right.

39:30.360 --> 39:34.160
Well I did. And if you're still
interested...

39:34.440 --> 39:37.091
Well I've sort of got a job, I'm
singing in a club.

39:37.360 --> 39:40.967
I'm sure we can work round that... The
movie is called Too Hot to Handle

39:41.240 --> 39:43.846
starring Jayne Mansfield.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.766
The Jayne Mansfield?
That's right. So,

39:47.040 --> 39:49.930
are you interested?
She's interested.

39:50.200 --> 39:53.044
Great. I'll be in touch.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.727
Can I ask you something?
Sure.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.651
This part. Why me?

40:00.360 --> 40:02.010
You've just got...

40:03.520 --> 40:05.409
Something.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.690
Jayne Mansfield!

40:21.440 --> 40:23.568
Is there anything else Miss Mansfield?

40:23.840 --> 40:25.729
I want flowers in my dressing room.
Flowers.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.451
Orchids.
Orchids. Right.

40:27.720 --> 40:31.805
And a bottle of champagne on ice
for guests. I always have guests.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.969
Orchids. Champagne.

40:34.240 --> 40:38.086
And in the chorus line, I want all the tall
girls with big chests moved to the back.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.011
Tall girls with boobs at the back...

40:41.520 --> 40:43.648
Who's this?

40:43.920 --> 40:47.527
This is Miss Barbara Windsor Miss
Mansfield, she's playing Ponytail.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.724
She's blonde.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.606
Is that a problem?

40:52.880 --> 40:55.770
Have it colored. Light brown.
Sorry,

40:56.040 --> 40:59.408
you can't do that only I've got
another job singing at a nightclub you see

40:59.680 --> 41:02.763
and if I'm not blonde tonight
I'll get the sack.

41:05.240 --> 41:08.130
And do something about those too.

41:16.120 --> 41:18.282
Stuck up cow.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.449
You alright love?

41:20.720 --> 41:23.610
You've gone white as a sheet.
I feel a bit sick.

41:25.320 --> 41:30.281
He's in Hans Crescent, a bit more
expensive but you're up and about quicker.

41:30.640 --> 41:33.291
He shoves Amyl nitrates up
your hooter then gets rid.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.210
Don't sound very nice.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.849
You could always keep it.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.408
I needed you then.

42:16.640 --> 42:19.769
Only coz your bloke was still in the nick.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.129
And your Mum was off playing happy
families with her new bloke.

42:24.640 --> 42:26.290
I needed you.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.244
Does it matter why?

43:00.480 --> 43:02.608
I was pregnant.

43:06.280 --> 43:07.691
Is it mine?

43:09.200 --> 43:11.567
Who else': Would it be?

43:15.480 --> 43:19.565
Wait. You said "was". "Was pregnant".

43:21.520 --> 43:23.443
I got rid of it.

43:25.880 --> 43:27.041
Oh.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.211
Are you okay?

43:36.280 --> 43:38.442
You still at the club?

43:39.200 --> 43:40.611
Yeah...

43:40.880 --> 43:43.531
And I've got a bit part in a film.
Yeah?

43:43.800 --> 43:45.928
Loads of blokes in it is there?

43:46.200 --> 43:47.406
No.

43:49.120 --> 43:51.043
So you're still waiting for me then?

43:52.280 --> 43:54.408
'Course I am Ronnie.

43:57.360 --> 43:59.010
I'm sorry...

43:59.280 --> 44:00.964
What for?

44:01.240 --> 44:02.240
All this.

44:05.600 --> 44:06.761
You know..

44:07.520 --> 44:09.170
Me too.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.568
You know I love ya, don't ya?

44:26.400 --> 44:28.801
Waste of space he was.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.730
Don't say that.
True wasn't it?

44:31.000 --> 44:32.650
He was good to me

44:33.680 --> 44:35.330
and I loved him.

44:36.560 --> 44:39.450
You deserved better.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.841
You spent too much time with him,

44:43.600 --> 44:45.728
got yourself in a mess.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.924
Oh and your life was perfect was it?

44:48.200 --> 44:52.762
You're the one in an empty theater
talking to yourself.

44:56.680 --> 44:58.330
I'm thinking.

44:59.080 --> 45:01.003
Drowning more like.

45:06.280 --> 45:09.841
Wyndham Theater, Charing Cross
road, tomorrow morning.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.376
What is it?
Ten sharp.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.400
What is it?
Ten sharp.

45:26.680 --> 45:28.842
Morning.
What you after?

45:29.120 --> 45:31.726
I've come for the auditions at ten.
It's only quarter to.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.411
I know, I'm always early.

45:33.720 --> 45:34.881
Mind your feet...

45:35.640 --> 45:37.051
So what part you up for then?

45:37.320 --> 45:39.971
Dunno, I'm only here coz my agent
told me to be.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.124
Don't you wanna be here then?

45:43.400 --> 45:47.485
They said it's a musical at Stratford
East... I'd rather be in the west end.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.889
See your name up there in lights can you?

45:50.160 --> 45:53.767
I ain't being grand, my Nan': A cleaner
at the Pimms factory in Shoreditch.

45:54.040 --> 45:57.656
It's just that I was born in the east end and Mum
worked really hard to get us away from there,

45:57.680 --> 46:00.524
wouldn't be much point if I
ended up back where we started.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.724
Well aren't you a cute little thing.

46:03.240 --> 46:05.846
Go on in, there's a kettle
in the green room. Ta.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.321
Hello?

46:22.600 --> 46:25.001
Who are you?
Barbara Windsor.

46:25.280 --> 46:28.363
Oh hello Babs, it's Lionel. Lionel Bart.

46:28.640 --> 46:31.291
Hello Li'... This one of yours?
Yer.

46:31.560 --> 46:33.449
I couldn't see you there.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.856
You still at the Winston club with Danny
La Rue? Yeah, you'll have to come down.

46:36.880 --> 46:39.281
I will.
Are you ready?

46:39.800 --> 46:42.644
Yeah, I've had a cup of tea, the
cleaner let me in early.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.329
Do you know what part you're up for?

46:45.600 --> 46:47.967
Not really.

46:48.280 --> 46:52.080
It's the part of Rosie, an Irish
prostitute. Can you do an Irish accent?

46:52.880 --> 46:54.769
No. Sorry.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.929
So where are you from?
Shoreditch.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.362
Do they have prostitutes in Shoreditch?

47:00.120 --> 47:03.488
A few.
Then give me an East End Rosie.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.611
When you're ready.

47:09.560 --> 47:13.645
'Ello, short time, mister?

47:13.920 --> 47:17.288
Five bob for a J' Arthur,
ten bob for a plate

47:17.560 --> 47:20.166
and it's a quid for the full card trick.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.256
That was very good.

47:25.280 --> 47:27.216
Thank you.
Can you sing?

47:27.240 --> 47:28.651
Yes.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.571
Have you got something prepared?
Where's the piano?

47:31.840 --> 47:33.968
If you can sing, you don't need one.

47:34.240 --> 47:36.163
Go on love, give it to 'em!

47:41.040 --> 47:43.884
Grab your coat and get your hat,

47:44.200 --> 47:47.522
leave your worry on the doorstep.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.690
Just direct your feet,

47:50.960 --> 47:53.611
to the sunny side of the street.

47:53.880 --> 47:56.724
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?

47:57.000 --> 48:00.368
And the happy tune is your step.

48:00.640 --> 48:03.291
Life can be so sweet,

48:03.560 --> 48:05.927
on the sunny side of the street.

48:06.200 --> 48:09.568
I used to walk in the shade,

48:09.840 --> 48:12.969
with those blues on parade

48:13.240 --> 48:15.856
but I'm not afraid,

48:15.880 --> 48:19.009
because I'm a Rover, erasing over.

48:19.280 --> 48:21.931
If I never have a cent

48:22.200 --> 48:25.283
I'd be rich as Rockefeller.

48:25.560 --> 48:27.961
Gold dust at my feet,

48:28.240 --> 48:31.130
on the sunny side of the street.

48:37.200 --> 48:40.568
Where have you been all my life?

48:41.080 --> 48:44.687
You're a wonderful little bird,
well not quite a bird, not yen...

48:44.960 --> 48:46.121
More an egg.

48:46.400 --> 48:49.290
You're the cleaner!

48:50.280 --> 48:52.647
This is Joan Littlewood Babs.

48:52.920 --> 48:56.049
And you, little birds egg, got the
job at the stage door.

49:00.680 --> 49:05.004
Alright everyone, "Fings Ain't What
they used T'be".

49:05.280 --> 49:09.126
Get yourselves in a circle, let's
do a first read through of the script.

49:09.400 --> 49:14.361
But I want you all to read each others parts.
Barbara I want you to play Tosher the ponce.

49:14.720 --> 49:16.370
You said I'm playing Rosie!

49:16.640 --> 49:21.601
Yes, but for now I want you to play Tosher, find out
what his character's about, what his problems are.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.411
Who he is!

49:23.920 --> 49:25.570
But he's a bloke.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.447
See! You're learning already, birds egg.

49:30.920 --> 49:32.604
Costumes.

49:33.840 --> 49:37.686
Here, grab a hat, I want you to
improvise.

49:37.960 --> 49:41.567
Now, switch genders, I want you to
fully inhabit each others roles.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.491
Now, get into character.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.922
Push his masculinity little bird.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.328
Yes, very good.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.762
Now, switch characters.

49:51.760 --> 49:55.128
This is a trust exercise
back to back,

49:55.400 --> 49:58.006
Up and down, now work together.

50:07.320 --> 50:09.891
Think about the underbelly of the city.

50:10.400 --> 50:16.885
Bigger, stronger, more liquid, smooth
like you are moving through oil.

50:17.160 --> 50:20.528
Now, stab, stab! Very good!

50:20.800 --> 50:22.723
Really kill!

50:23.480 --> 50:28.441
Now look at the model box, comes
down here like that...

50:29.040 --> 50:31.407
Stripped back.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.568
Nothing for you to hide behind.

50:34.840 --> 50:36.763
Back to the script.

50:37.040 --> 50:41.125
Right, let's do it again, everyone
switch characters

50:41.400 --> 50:44.722
and this time don't sing the
songs, speak them!

50:45.000 --> 50:50.291
I don't get it... We've read it backwards, sideways,
read other peoples parts, pulled the story apart,

50:50.600 --> 50:52.090
then put it back together again.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.056
You've changed the lines, the
songs, who was doing what,

50:58.080 --> 51:00.481
then changed it all back again.

51:00.760 --> 51:04.606
Why can't we just all learn our parts,
learn the songs and just get on with it?

51:05.120 --> 51:07.487
You're not really enjoying yourself
are you birds egg?

51:07.760 --> 51:09.205
No I'm not.

51:09.480 --> 51:11.608
Too much like hard work?
No.

51:11.880 --> 51:16.204
What then? You don't like new
things? Doing things differently?

51:16.480 --> 51:19.848
I'm just asking why we can't just
rehearse it normally.

51:20.600 --> 51:24.040
Because I'm trying to find something else,
to make it better than it has a right to be.

51:24.240 --> 51:26.720
But I hate it.
So why don't you piss off then?

51:27.160 --> 51:31.688
What? You heard me. Piss off to the west
end if that's where you'd rather be.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.643
Alright then I will!

51:37.960 --> 51:39.610
That's it girl, you tell her.

51:40.760 --> 51:45.004
That was terrible I think you should
do it all again.

51:45.320 --> 51:48.688
We just spoken to the Wyndham.
They've got some flamin' cheek.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.961
Joan Littlewood is the most innovative theater director
this country's ever seen and you've just walked out on her.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.323
She told me to piss off.

51:56.640 --> 51:58.881
That didn't mean you had to
actually... piss off!

51:59.200 --> 52:00.281
Well I did.

52:00.640 --> 52:06.807
Do you know how many actors, with ten times the experience you've
got would give their right arm to work with Joan Littlewood?

52:07.120 --> 52:10.806
Well let 'em then...
Barbara, please don't do this...

52:11.120 --> 52:15.045
You've worked really hard to get an
opportunity like this,

52:15.360 --> 52:17.328
don't waste it.

52:25.560 --> 52:26.971
Stubborn.

52:27.560 --> 52:30.370
Just like your Father!
Oi oi!

52:43.960 --> 52:46.201
More articulate!

52:46.520 --> 52:48.204
More dynamic!

52:50.800 --> 52:53.007
Hello Birds egg,

52:53.640 --> 52:57.008
Carry on everyone don't stop.

53:00.160 --> 53:04.085
Had a nice time up west?
See your name up in lights did you?

53:05.240 --> 53:08.608
It was very nice thank you.

53:10.920 --> 53:13.730
Can I play Rosie now?

53:15.720 --> 53:17.961
Someone give her a script.

53:20.560 --> 53:23.370
Here y'are Bar.
What's this?

53:23.680 --> 53:26.490
Joan asked me to write a song for you.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.730
She really thinks you've got something.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.724
Do you wanna give it a go?

53:31.320 --> 53:33.288
Just sing it... Properly?

53:39.840 --> 53:41.763
Sit her on a box.
What?

53:42.080 --> 53:44.321
Center stage. On a box.

53:47.480 --> 53:49.721
Now sit on your hands birds egg.

53:50.040 --> 53:51.963
Me hands?
Yes your hands.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.649
Otherwise you'll go all west end on us,

53:56.000 --> 53:59.641
waving your arms about like
you're Judy Hamin' Garland.

54:09.880 --> 54:14.841
Where do little birds go to?

54:15.240 --> 54:21.168
In the wintertime.

54:21.480 --> 54:29.480
They'll be blizzard: And snow too,
in the wintertime.

54:31.960 --> 54:39.960
And the thought of it horrifies me so...

54:44.160 --> 54:51.203
Where do? Where do? Where do?
little birds go?

54:54.920 --> 55:02.920
Where do? Where do? Where do?
little birds go.

55:25.560 --> 55:29.840
You got a minute Bar? I've got some good friends in,
they'd love to meet you. 'Course darlin', bring 'em in.

55:33.760 --> 55:38.721
Bar, these are the Kray twins, Ronnie
and Reggie and their brother Charlie.

55:39.160 --> 55:41.970
Hello boys, come on in.
Very nice to meet you.

55:42.280 --> 55:45.363
You too.
We really enjoyed the show.

55:45.680 --> 55:48.490
You were fantastic.
Thank you.

55:48.800 --> 55:51.007
Can I get you all a drink?

55:51.360 --> 55:53.760
No thank you. We don't want to
take up any more of your time,

55:54.120 --> 55:58.045
We've got a club on the Mile End road, the
Kentucky. You should try and drop in.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.323
Chuck knows where it is.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.523
I might just do that.

56:03.160 --> 56:05.322
Come on then, let's leave
the lady in peace.

56:05.640 --> 56:09.964
Oh, alright. Well it was very
lovely to meet you boys.

56:17.160 --> 56:20.881
That drink you offered? Thought I
might take you up on it.

56:21.200 --> 56:24.602
Tomorrow night. Maybe have a bit of
dinner first.

56:24.960 --> 56:27.406
Blimey, you're not shy are you?

56:27.760 --> 56:29.285
That a yes?

56:29.600 --> 56:30.806
We'll see.

56:35.520 --> 56:38.603
Thanks Bar.
That's alright darlin'...

56:38.960 --> 56:42.043
They seem like nice boys.
Yeah.

57:15.040 --> 57:17.202
You've been doing alright
for yourself Barb.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.369
I work hard.

57:23.520 --> 57:28.481
Been dreaming about you doing me a fry up. Yeah well
don't get your hopes up, I ain't much of a cook.

57:29.400 --> 57:32.290
You missed me then?
Course I have.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.162
You've been in the papers a lot.

57:38.560 --> 57:41.484
Like I said, I've been working hard.

57:41.880 --> 57:44.042
Things are going really well.

57:44.440 --> 57:45.521
Good.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.924
Well we can enjoy it
together now can't we?

57:50.680 --> 57:51.761
Yeah.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.766
So you ready for this?

57:56.560 --> 57:58.722
Not half.

58:11.240 --> 58:14.528
Hardly your style was it darlin'?

58:14.920 --> 58:16.285
Housewife.

58:17.480 --> 58:23.328
Just had a call, actually I've had lots of
calls, how d'you fancy doing some telly?

58:23.720 --> 58:25.529
Not really.
Good,

58:25.920 --> 58:27.729
I'll tell them you'll be there.
Hang on,

58:28.120 --> 58:29.565
you haven't told me what it is yet.

58:29.960 --> 58:32.486
It's a new comedy set in a dress
factory, called The Rag Trade.

58:36.200 --> 58:40.171
They love you, it's a hit... The Tony
Hancock people want to see you.

58:40.440 --> 58:43.330
And there's a film part
called "Sparrows Can't Sing",

58:43.840 --> 58:47.447
the director wants you but the producers don't,
so we'll have to see how that plays out.

58:47.720 --> 58:49.131
Who's the Director?

58:49.400 --> 58:52.051
Either birds egg does it,
or you can all piss off.

58:53.760 --> 58:56.161
I've just heard, you've got the part.

59:00.560 --> 59:04.884
So you're married to jimmy Booth who goes off
to sea, comes back and you've buggered off

59:05.160 --> 59:09.245
We'll be shooting it in Stepney, so
you'll feel right at home birds egg.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.324
I've got a scene at the end in a night
club, do you know anywhere we could use?

59:17.720 --> 59:20.849
We don't normally allow shooting in
our club Miss Littlewood,

59:21.120 --> 59:24.727
but on this occasion, as you're a friend
of Barbara's, it would be a pleasure.

59:25.240 --> 59:26.890
Well we're very grateful.

59:30.560 --> 59:32.722
Do you mind if we get a picture?
Course not darlin'.

59:42.200 --> 59:43.611
Smile.

59:46.560 --> 59:49.166
Thank you.
You're very welcome.

59:53.320 --> 59:56.210
The bloody hyenas are gathering, birds egg.
Eh?

59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.565
The press are outside. Apparently
your boyfriend's been arrested again.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.369
It was a fit up Barb.
It always is.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:10.120
They can't prove nothing, they're just trying
it on, my brief reckons she'll get me off.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:16.526
You can't keep doing this Ronnie, I'm in the west end
now, I'm doing a new film, the papers are all over me,

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.362
you have to tell me the truth! I'm the one
stuck out here trying to deal with it all!

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.736
Shouldn't you be worrying about me? Not yourself? Or are
you getting too grand for me now you're a big star?

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.606
No. I am worried about you.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.721
Then act like it.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.329
Sorry.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.170
Hey wait a minute! Who's that?

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.047
Look Charlie I've made up me mind, I ain't
coming back I don't ever wanna meet you again.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.209
You've already met me haven't you?
Yeah, well...

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.480
Anyway I'm going home. I'm
coming with ya. Shut up!

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.802
Can't think when you look at me.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:03.760
Miss Barbara Windsor's latest film role in "Sparrows Can't
Sing" has proved a success on both sides of the Atlantic

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.247
with Miss Windsor nominated for a Bafta award,
cementing her place at the very top of her profession.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:18.560
In other news, Miss Windsor's beau, Ronnie Knight has been
found not guilty of theft from a Chelsea power station.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.402
What did I tell ya?

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.404
What do you want?

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.767
I was talking with my client if its
all the same.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:40.287
It's work, Ronnie. You go on home,
I'll be home later, cook you a nice meal.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.565
You don't know him like I do, no one does.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.208
Well be that as it may, it seems
that in typical Windsor fashion,

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.324
you seem to have two tigers by the tail...
Eh?

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:06.601
Ronnie Knight and your career.
The offers are flooding in,

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.921
the best of which seems to be from a
producer called Peter Rogers,

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.408
he wants you for his next film.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.856
That's amazing! What is it?

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.963
A comedy. Oh... It'll
be good for you.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.408
To do something funny after Sparrows.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.048
What's it called?
Carry on Spying.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:33.056
Oh I nearly forgot, June's agreed
to a divorce... So I was thinking.

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.286
What?

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.122
Well everywhere I go these days people
are calling me Mr Windsor... So I thought.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.050
Ronnie don't do this.
Do what?

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.971
You're gonna propose.
Don't you wanna marry me then?

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.041
I just like things the way they are.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.401
Good, then they'll be exactly the
way they are.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.364
Only we'll be married.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.007
Ronnie...
I mean it Barb,

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.648
either you marry me or I'm off...
You don't mean that.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.604
Bu“ I?

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.926
Would it really be so bad?
being my wife?

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.565
No.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.642
Alright then.
Good girl.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.767
You not going down on one knee or nothin'?

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.922
Nah.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.567
Alright everyone settle down,

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.442
this is Barbara, she'll be playing
Daphne Honeybutt.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.566
Don't worry Babs, they're a good lot.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.209
Right! Arrival at the restaurant.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.130
Alright Babs?
Yes ta.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.962
Watch out for Kenny, he can be difficult
and doesn't really like new people.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.641
I've heard he's a pain in the bum.
Watch he doesn't hear you.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.288
Don't care if he does. Didn't he fall
outwith Fenella Fielding?

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.927
It's Kenny Babs, he's fallen out
with everyone.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.285
Alright, let's make a start please.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.691
Hi'ya!

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.601
And... turn over.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.968
117, take one.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.567
Amen'.!

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:41.121
You can come in now...
Hello, good evening... My cloak, thank you.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.811
May I have your hat sir?

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.970
Thank you very much.
Thank you sir.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.690
Oh well, never mind... Hair today,
gone tomorrow.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.329
What do we do now sir?

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:03.881
Yes, well now we'd better split up, you two go in together... But
from now on you don't know me and I don't know you... Understood.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.004
Yes of course sir. We don't know you.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.441
Cut!

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:16.206
Babs, the line is "Yes of course
sir, we don't know who you are..."

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.881
Sorry everyone! My fault.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.288
Oooh... Dah-ling, do please get it right.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.521
Don't you talk to me like that with Fenella
Fielding': Minge hair stuck round your chops

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.530
coz I won't bloody stand for it!

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:44.441
Haaaa! Isn't she WONDERFUL! I
love her!

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.210
I'm Kenny!

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.131
I'm Barbara.
Lovely to meet you, you are funny...

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.450
Hey, how did you know about all that...

01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:02.209
From now on, you don't know me and I don't know
you. Yes of course sir, we don't know who you are.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.403
That's right, mums the word.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.808
Hello birds egg.
Hiya.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.000
I've been asked to do 'Oh What a
Lovely War' on Broadway, do you fancy it?

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.607
Oh I dunno, I'm not sure
it's my cup of tea.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:17.841
Why? Well it's a company piece isn't it,
nothing really for me to get my teeth into.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.607
Too grand for it now are you?
Now you're a movie star? No.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.770
No. I just like what I'm doing that's all.
Carry on Spying?

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.690
Now who's being bleedin' grand?

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.644
Did I mention it was bleedin' Broadway?

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:33.450
I know... And I'd love to do that one day, but
with the right play, I'm just not sure this is it.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.011
If you're not careful you'll end up playing this
sexy little blonde for the rest of your life.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.411
Spread your wings little bird.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.287
Can I let you know? I'll have to
talk to Ronnie.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.368
Quick as you can birds egg.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.848
If that's what you wanna
do babe, then do it.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.844
It's for a few months.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.081
I got fifteen months remember, we
lived through that.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.764
He said I could go.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.004
Good girl. See you in New York.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.320
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:28.928
Who wouldn't be a soldier, eh?
Oh it's a shame to take the pay.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.369
As soon as reveille is gone,
we feel just as heavy as lead.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.207
But we never get up till the sergeant
brings us breakfast up to bed.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.649
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.680
What do we want with eggs and ham?
when we've got plum and apple jam?

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.323
Forms four, right turn,
how shall we spend the money we earn?

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.530
Oh, oh, oh, it's a lovely war.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.804
Think we might have another hit.
You think so?

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.203
You're the toast of
Broadway Babs, enjoy it.

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:26.046
Come on... Someone wants to meet you.
Who?

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:27.850
You'll see...

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.081
Warren.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.921
Here she is!

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.121
Hi.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.761
Oh hello.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.603
I just wanted to say I saw the show
and I thought you were terrific.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.241
And congratulations on
your Tony nomination.

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:53.884
Thank you. Sorry, have we met?
Only you look really familiar.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.122
I'm Warren Beatty.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.322
Yes you are.
Yes I am.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.361
Well I'm glad we cleared that up.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.560
Maybe we could have a drink while you're in
New York? Tea at Sardi's Maybe?

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:10.044
Oh that sounds nice.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.243
I'll give you a call.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.323
He's got the hots for you.
Me? Don't be stupid, of course he hasn't.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.359
It's Warren Beatty, he's got the
hots for everyone.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.362
For you...

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.725
Wasn't all work though was it?

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.009
Shepard Coleman?

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.207
Don't Dad.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:56.444
I thought that's why we're here...
You trying to make sense of things.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.251
I am.
Then you shouldn't miss things out,

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.688
might be important.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.761
I was a long way from home...

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.410
I'd never met anyone quite like him before.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.130
It wasn't about sex,

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.130
we spent most of our time talking... Til
three or four in the morning sometimes.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.010
The most conversation I'd ever had with Ronnie
was how many eggs he wanted with his fry up.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.648
I didn't know it could be like that.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:55.163
Being with Shep in New York made me
realise marrying Ronnie was a mistake.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.365
He wanted me to stay.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.728
But we both knew I couldn't.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.560
See;

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.809
Better to talk about it.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.041
Yeah, you're right.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.521
Shall we talk about when I got back?

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.769
Are you Barbara Deeks?

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.325
I was.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.405
Do I know you?

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.848
I'm married to your Father.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.808
That was a nice surprise, wasn't it?

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.962
So I remarried, no big deal.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.560
And didn't you want me as a bridesmaid?
You weren't a part of my life then.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.888
You were always a part of mine.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.048
I'd had a heart attack.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.046
Come in.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.765
Daddy?

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.325
Hello love.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.850
How are you?
Julie said you've been ill.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.648
You need to look after yourself better.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.484
Stop fussing.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.645
Well...

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.489
Been making quite a name
for yourself I see.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.330
Wasn't sure you knew.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.401
Made me very proud.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.731
Should be proud of yourself too.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.650
Doing so well.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.128
Every audition I went to

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.529
sung 'Sunny Side of the Street',
just like you showed me.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.121
And every time I got the job.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.530
You always were Daddy's little girl
weren't you?

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.324
I still will be...

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.770
If you'll let me.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.416
Not been much of a Dad have I?

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.646
Don't say that.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.250
It wasn't easy,

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.965
I know that.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.330
But all this time...

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.330
whatever I was doing.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.401
Part of me was hoping you were watching,

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.366
that maybe you'd even come and see me.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.205
Nearly did.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.528
A hundred times.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.290
You're here now though eh?

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.525
Yeah.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.165
It was like I was 5 years old again.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:33.331
Grab your coat and get your hat,
Leave your worry on the doorstep.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:41.001
Just direct your feet.
to the sunny side of the street.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.162
I think that's enough
now, he's getting tired.

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.329
But I've only just got here.
She's alright.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.047
Doctor said you weren't to get over
excited. He needs peace and quiet.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.369
Oh okay...
Maybe I could come back again.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.970
Or you could come to dinner?

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.128
When you're up to it.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.129
I'd like that.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.929
I'll show you out.

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.086
He will be okay, won't he?
Yeah.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.171
I'll look after him. Just as I
have been doing.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.328
But I'm here now, I can help.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.921
If I need anything, I'll be sure to
let you know.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:43.641
After I came to see you, I kept
calling, writing you letters.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.647
Why didn't I ever hear from you.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.208
We weren't expecting you.
Well, we thought with it being Christmas.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.806
You should have phoned first.
I have been trying.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.288
I want to see my Dad.
Who is it?

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.445
Merry Christmas Daddy.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.602
I don't want nothing off you.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.444
Hold on Mr D, what are you doing?

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.130
You can stay out of it an' all,

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.367
She's your daughter.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:09.882
Not any more she ain't, you ain't been to
see me for months!

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.448
Well now I don't have time for you!

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.006
I tried to see you Dad, I called. Ask her!

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.606
I said get out!

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.849
You know what john, if you weren't
an old man, so help me.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.485
Get out!

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.610
You heard him.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.928
We want you to leave.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.167
Daddy please don't do this!

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.680
Come on.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.482
How could you have done that?

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:04.041
She didn't tell me you'd been calling.
I thought you'd just forgotten me.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.296
You could have asked me.
I saw red.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.369
Like you did that day in court?
Oh that's right, drag all that up again.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.520
It's not dragging things up it's my life!

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.169
All I ever did was love you,

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.930
think the best of you.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.691
All you ever did was push me away.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.643
Didn't seem to do you much harm.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.001
Made you stand on your own two feet.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.921
Toughened you up.
You really believe that don't you?

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.930
True innit?

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.250
And you're always right, aren't you Dad?
I was right about that bloke of yours.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.449
Barb wait!

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.201
So while the police were kicking down your
front door and questioning you all night,

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.688
he was off shagging someone else.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.365
Alright! I know! I'm a bad judge of men,
story of my bleedin' life.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:20.531
And you know why Dad?
Because I believe them.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.520
I believe 'em when they say
everything will be alright,

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.327
that I'm the only
girl they've ever really loved

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.921
and that we'll live happily ever after.

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.406
Just like I believed you when you said it!

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.890
You want to go back to work?
Yes please.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:47.324
They want you for another Carry On film. Carry on
Doctor. Don't tell me, I'm a sexy little blonde nurse?

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.966
How did you guess?
Who else is in it?

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.121
Usual crowd, they're trying to get Sid James back. He's been
ill, but said he'd do it as long as he can stay in bed.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.891
Go on then, I just want to be busy.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.002
You're a proper actress little bird,

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.290
if you do this, it's all you'll ever be...
The sexy little blonde.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.451
You always was daddy's
little girl weren't you?

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.165
I'll never let you down.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.169
You are a wonderful little bird...

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.328
Barbara number 2 out
acts Barbara number I...

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.729
Can't turn the clock back, can we?

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.045
No...

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.522
What you doing here love?

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.331
Phone's not ringing like it did Dad.
You'll always get work.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.371
Not much call for fifty
year old sexy blondes.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:07.641
You're more than that.
And all this... It's just a blip.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:12.921
You wait and see, any time now, you'll be
crossing over.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.643
Grab your coat and grab your hat...
My whole life!

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.402
I've never been able to find it.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.726
The sunny side of the street.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.723
You know why Dad?
Coz there was always your shadow across it.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.611
Always making me think I'd done
something wrong,

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.491
that I'd let you down somehow.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.041
So I could never quite see the sun.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.891
It left me trying to make
it better all the time,

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.929
to please you.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.366
To make you happy with me again.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:06.490
To make you pick me up and
twirl me round again.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.521
But you weren't bloody there were you?

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.406
I don't need this.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:23.408
So I tried to make everybody else
happy instead.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:27.566
Hoping just one of them would make
me feel the way that you did.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.728
And that's all I've ever been doing.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.446
Since the day you walked past me in
that court room like I didn't exist.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:48.681
A little girl trying to make her
Dad happy with her again.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.846
How could I have kids when I was
still a kid myself?

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.171
And how could I love anyone else?

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.451
I can't do it anymore Daddy.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:10.611
I need to be happy.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.890
It's my time now.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.204
Ta da!

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.204
The car's done, but it
was two hundred quid.

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:39.449
They reckoned if we hadn't stopped when we did or it would have been a
new engine. So at least we don't have to go to Wimbledon on the bus.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.922
That'd be something wouldn't it?

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:46.086
You turning up on the bus...?

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.761
What?

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.647
Ain't you lovely?

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.971
Yes I am.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.576
So what's brought this on?
just had a walk round,

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.080
cleared my head...
Good,

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:11.083
you'll need a clear head munchkin, coz we're
gonna get you out of these one nighters

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.688
and get you a proper acting job.
Show everyone what you can do.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.207
You reckon?

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:22.441
No-one knows who I am any more. Don't be
daft, you're Barbara bleedin' Windsor.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:27.163
Here maybe we should change the posters...
"One night only" -

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.802
Miss Barbara Bleeding Windsor.

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.124
It'll do, until they make you a dame.

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:39.687
We're gonna be alright aren't we darlin'?

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.443
Me and you?

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.841
'Course we are.

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:30.200
Grab your coat and get your hat,
Leave your worry on the doorstep.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:37.130
Life can we so sweet, on the
sunny side of the street.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:45.166
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
and the happy tune is your step.

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:51.563
Life can we so sweet, on the
sunny side of the street.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:59.048
I used to walk in the shade,
with those blues on parade

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:06.005
but I'm not afraid,
because I'm a Rover, crossing over.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:13.210
If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:17.247
Gold dust at my feet...

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.480
On the sunny side of the street.
