Ahem. Aren't you forgetting something?

18:43.373 --> 18:46.752
Oh, come on.
Can I try it out for a little while longer?

18:47.002 --> 18:48.337
I just got back in the game.

Then how about
we find you another body?

Borrow?

19:20.744 --> 19:22.246
If you say so, Batman.

19:32.923 --> 19:34.758
Hey, take it easy. I need him.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.302
Don't sweat it, Mac. He'll be okay.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.096
A little sore, maybe.

I will have my revenge, Batman.

So I was thinking, Mac.

21:43.011 --> 21:46.640
Maybe you were right about there
being a reason I have these powers.
