WEBVTT

01:45.605 --> 01:46.606
What?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.274
Living together?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.359
That's right.

01:49.859 --> 01:54.781
Mr. Oliva lives with his lover
in this prison.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.118
Not only does he live
a comfortable prison life,

01:58.952 --> 02:01.788
but he gets to have his
woman on top of that?

02:02.413 --> 02:04.124
With a prison life like that,

02:04.207 --> 02:07.293
what could he possibly atone? Or repent?

02:07.377 --> 02:09.921
"Repent," "atone"…

02:10.505 --> 02:14.300
those are not words
he concerns himself with.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.261
What's she like?

02:16.761 --> 02:19.013
Well, that's just it.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.267
No one's ever seen her.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.228
Are you sure she's actually here?

02:25.311 --> 02:29.816
We've heard about her for years.

02:30.441 --> 02:33.945
But only ever from Mr. Oliva's mouth.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.073
The way he was carrying on,

02:37.657 --> 02:39.576
she must be a real beauty.

02:39.659 --> 02:44.038
That's also something
we've only ever heard from Unchained--

02:44.122 --> 02:45.582
I mean, from Mr. Oliva's lips.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.420
It's gotta be a sham.

03:01.681 --> 03:05.977
Maria, I continue to agonize.

03:06.561 --> 03:11.024
There aren't enough words in this world.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.117
Entirely too few…

03:22.452 --> 03:27.874
to express a feeling beyond "I love you."

03:28.458 --> 03:29.876
And yet,

03:29.959 --> 03:32.879
what words could convey the feeling

03:33.463 --> 03:36.090
that lies beyond my pectoral muscles

03:36.174 --> 03:40.637
and consumes my entire body?

03:42.096 --> 03:46.684
The simple phrase "I love you,"
is just not enough.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.730
With this indescribable feeling
weighing on my heart,

03:50.813 --> 03:52.148
I've come here today.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.613
More than love.

04:06.579 --> 04:11.292
Maria, how are you feeling, honey?

04:12.126 --> 04:15.296
Most likely,
he made up this imaginary lover

04:15.380 --> 04:19.676
to further wield the freedom
he has in this prison.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.055
To solidify his image as the Unchained.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.432
To be honest,

04:26.516 --> 04:29.227
we've sort of come to that
conclusion as well.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.939
But if that rumor
spread through the prison,

04:33.523 --> 04:36.526
all 4,000 of us would be choked to death.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.070
Just watch.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.700
When the sun rises for the second time,

04:44.325 --> 04:46.703
he'll go back
to being just another inmate.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.708
One lowly inmate,
with no strength and no lover.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.754
Kent, hold on to this for me.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.842
Give it to me at the arena.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.471
Whatever you do, do not open it.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.934
Rain, wind, waves and lightning
will jump out.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.404
Ow, hot, hot.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.117
What's wrong, honey?

05:26.200 --> 05:29.871
As always,
I've come at the time you specified

05:29.954 --> 05:32.957
and I brought all these roses you love.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.885
You are so incompetent!

05:44.552 --> 05:46.888
You useless loser!

05:47.722 --> 05:49.891
You deadbeat!

05:50.558 --> 05:52.060
You glutton!

05:52.685 --> 05:53.895
You brute!

05:53.978 --> 05:55.897
You narcissist!

05:55.980 --> 05:58.900
Ungrateful child!
Good-for-nothing! Womanizer!

05:58.983 --> 06:00.902
Trash! Idiot!

06:04.947 --> 06:07.492
Maria, are you finished?

06:28.638 --> 06:32.266
Come on. Be in a better mood, honey.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.690
You idiot!

06:41.401 --> 06:43.444
I may be an idiot, but I'm happy.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.697
With you by my side.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.702
Darling!

06:53.287 --> 06:54.372
Wait!

06:55.123 --> 06:56.707
Wait!

06:58.543 --> 07:00.461
D-Darling!

07:01.295 --> 07:02.964
Darling!

07:03.589 --> 07:05.633
It's too stimulating.

07:05.716 --> 07:08.678
I can't accept that word from you!

07:09.303 --> 07:10.555
I love you.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.225
Maria!

07:15.059 --> 07:17.645
You are so beautiful!

07:18.312 --> 07:20.940
I'll show off to everyone in the arena!

07:21.023 --> 07:25.236
I'll show them just how beautiful you are!

07:25.319 --> 07:27.238
It's more than love!

07:27.822 --> 07:29.031
Maria!

07:41.085 --> 07:42.378
Um…

07:42.462 --> 07:43.379
Hm?

07:43.463 --> 07:46.591
You've been doing that
over and over since last night.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.135
What you are listening to?

07:49.218 --> 07:53.639
You mentioned something
about rain and wind,

07:53.723 --> 07:55.850
waves and lightning…

07:58.060 --> 08:00.646
We're just so keen
to find out what's inside.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.150
It's courage.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.171
Courage?

08:26.589 --> 08:29.884
That's right. There's courage in here.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.556
It was the morning after
a record-breaking hurricane.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.017
The day I was to set off for America.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.832
That's where you gathered it from?

09:03.459 --> 09:05.419
Last night, all night…

09:06.128 --> 09:07.630
in a spot like that?

09:11.467 --> 09:15.179
They say you're the biggest
weakling on the island.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.391
Thank you.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.770
You're bravest one on the island.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.742
It was a strange site.

09:37.577 --> 09:41.289
Despite being a prison,
holding over 4,000 inmates,

09:41.372 --> 09:43.666
there were no guards today.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.963
As if, just for today,
there weren't any inmates.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.938
It's almost time.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.733
Who do you think will win?

10:09.400 --> 10:10.818
Oliva.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.070
I think the opposite.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.780
Hmm…

10:17.366 --> 10:21.120
They say Mr. Oliva is bringing his lover.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.497
Huh? He has a girlfriend?

10:23.581 --> 10:26.709
Who knows? I guess we'll see soon.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.463
Private talk was supposed to be
forbidden in this space,

10:31.213 --> 10:35.176
but the inmates talked as much
as they liked, for it was allowed.

10:35.843 --> 10:36.677
All because…

10:38.054 --> 10:39.472
He's here!

10:40.056 --> 10:41.474
Here he comes!

10:42.308 --> 10:44.352
No one would try to escape today.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.066
Mr. Second!

10:50.149 --> 10:51.317
Mr. President!

10:51.400 --> 10:52.985
Idiot! He's exactly that!

10:53.903 --> 10:56.656
Best pirate!

11:21.597 --> 11:24.266
It's really exciting, isn't it?

11:24.350 --> 11:26.852
I'll just say this.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.022
Even if someone tried to escape right now,

11:31.357 --> 11:33.776
I wouldn't move one step from here!

11:35.444 --> 11:37.780
I'll pretend I didn't hear that!

11:40.866 --> 11:42.326
Here he comes!

11:42.410 --> 11:43.285
It's Oliva!

11:47.873 --> 11:48.708
Huh?

11:48.791 --> 11:49.959
What the--?

11:54.588 --> 11:56.382
What's he carrying?

11:57.383 --> 11:58.676
Warden!

11:58.759 --> 12:01.262
You're kidding me! He's done it!

12:02.388 --> 12:03.556
He brought his lover…

12:04.640 --> 12:05.516
It's a bed!

12:05.599 --> 12:08.060
A king-size bed, no less!

12:08.644 --> 12:09.937
His lover is on it!

12:10.020 --> 12:11.981
That super beauty!

12:12.064 --> 12:13.566
I can't believe it's true!

12:14.150 --> 12:17.069
-What's she like? Did you see?
-I can't see a damn thing!

12:17.611 --> 12:18.779
Show us!

12:38.007 --> 12:38.841
This…

12:40.050 --> 12:40.968
This is…

12:42.011 --> 12:43.012
His lover?

12:49.310 --> 12:51.687
Hurry up and get started.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.857
The legendary lover, Maria.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.026
Seeing her,

12:57.109 --> 13:02.364
all 4,000 inmates had the same thought.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.700
Later in life,

13:04.784 --> 13:09.747
how would they describe Maria
to someone else?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.666
Only one thing was clear.

13:13.501 --> 13:17.463
The term "fat" didn't nearly cover it.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.134
What are you looking at?

13:22.718 --> 13:24.386
They're not looking at you.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.889
They're admiring you, Maria!

13:27.473 --> 13:29.642
Admiring your beauty!

13:34.730 --> 13:36.816
Don't give me that crap!

13:36.899 --> 13:39.401
What could they possibly see as beautiful?

13:43.781 --> 13:46.492
Anything and everything about you.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.536
No one would say any different.

13:49.161 --> 13:53.749
All 4,000 inmates here
can see your beauty.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.670
Right, you guys?

14:48.679 --> 14:50.306
The tuxedo is just stood there!

14:50.389 --> 14:52.474
Like the empty shell of a molting cicada!

14:52.558 --> 14:54.184
No way!

14:54.268 --> 14:55.686
That's Oliva for you.

14:55.769 --> 14:56.979
No one can beat him.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.189
I'm off, Maria.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.735
To prove just how strong your man is.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.203
What a lovely lover you have.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.247
Can't afford to lose, can you?

15:15.831 --> 15:17.666
Sorry, Guevaru.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.754
But I thank you for serving as my foil!

15:23.589 --> 15:27.009
The motivation for fighting varies
for each person.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.011
It's the jar!

15:29.678 --> 15:30.888
This is mine…

15:31.847 --> 15:33.515
He's opening it!

16:05.798 --> 16:06.799
That's enough.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.301
Let's begin.

16:22.064 --> 16:26.151
Mr. Oliva, could I ask you to hold
the corner of this bandana?

16:27.653 --> 16:29.613
Ah, Loser Lose.

16:29.697 --> 16:33.075
How nostalgic. I played it often as a kid.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.953
Loser Lose.

16:36.036 --> 16:39.415
A rule originally developed
in the 16th century

16:39.498 --> 16:41.583
for duels between European nobles.

16:42.668 --> 16:47.089
While holding on
to opposite ends of a handkerchief

16:47.172 --> 16:48.424
the duelers trade blows.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.010
The rules are extremely simple.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.346
If you let go, you lose..

16:55.180 --> 16:56.515
As the name suggests,

16:56.598 --> 17:00.853
the one who releases
the handkerchief, the "Loser,"

17:00.936 --> 17:02.146
also loses their honor.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.314
A simple, yet merciless game.

17:05.899 --> 17:10.070
The trivial action of holding on
to the edge of the handkerchief,

17:10.154 --> 17:13.407
represents their will
to defend their honor.

17:14.950 --> 17:18.203
It is a game
with the most rational of rules.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.623
Now J. Guevaru,

17:21.707 --> 17:27.880
you were trained by your grandfather,
a master of Mugakure-style ninjutsu.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.758
Is stalking your hobby, Unchained?

17:30.841 --> 17:34.762
It is said you begin handstand training
from using all five fingers

17:34.845 --> 17:37.222
to eventually, just the thumb.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.017
It requires incredible finger strength.

17:40.100 --> 17:44.897
It seems to me that you chose this rule
because you are proud of that strength.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.273
Am I wrong?

17:46.857 --> 17:48.442
If you've got cold feet,

17:48.525 --> 17:50.486
we can change the rule,

17:50.569 --> 17:54.281
but when it comes to finger-pinch strength
you're no slouch, either.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.329
The tales reached even my island.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.956
Bending a coin in fourths,

18:03.749 --> 18:05.751
crushing full beer cans,

18:06.251 --> 18:10.923
lifting an ax
with the stump still attached,

18:11.924 --> 18:14.676
bending a rail-spike…

18:15.886 --> 18:18.013
Okay, okay, enough.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.058
Is stalking your hobby, Mr. Second?

18:21.725 --> 18:23.811
Meaning, you won't need a handicap.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.814
There's no need for concern, you mean.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.578
Are we on, kid?

18:41.662 --> 18:45.082
Indeed we are.

19:09.857 --> 19:10.858
I know.

19:12.442 --> 19:15.863
These punches aren't anywhere
near enough to knock out

19:15.946 --> 19:18.365
the strongest fighter in America.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.870
But, he doesn't need to be knocked out.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.497
Oh, right in the chin.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.878
Even if he isn't knocked out,
all he needs to do is forget.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.255
Forget about the little cloth.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.631
Forget its corner.

19:35.424 --> 19:39.052
Just forget that he's pinching it.

19:49.479 --> 19:50.647
Look at that!

19:51.315 --> 19:54.943
Oliva's giant body is being held up
just by that bandana!

19:55.027 --> 19:56.153
And…

19:56.236 --> 19:59.656
Guevaru's holding on with both hands

19:59.740 --> 20:01.241
but look how he's holding it!

20:07.915 --> 20:10.667
Oh, did you change your grip?

20:10.751 --> 20:13.921
Clutching firmly with both hands

20:14.504 --> 20:15.923
doesn't look very cool.

20:17.257 --> 20:21.929
The aristocrats who created these rules
must be turning in their graves.

20:22.012 --> 20:26.516
I think I'll follow your lead
and change my grip too.

20:27.017 --> 20:30.646
You unwittingly changed your grip.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.898
Likewise, mine won't do.

20:33.398 --> 20:37.319
So, I'd like to change mine to this.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.528
What do you think?

20:44.117 --> 20:45.327
His pinky?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.080
Is he that confident in his grip strength?

20:48.163 --> 20:49.456
That's ridiculous!

20:49.539 --> 20:51.333
A breeze will blow it away!

20:51.917 --> 20:53.335
Or, is it a strategy?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.463
I hear that aristocrats back in the day

20:56.546 --> 20:59.341
ate and held their glasses
with their pinky out.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.594
It may seem meaningless at first glance,

21:02.678 --> 21:05.847
but there's actually a purpose
to having the pinky out.

21:06.765 --> 21:12.104
It was to conserve spices,
then as valuable as precious metals.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.441
It was good etiquette
to pinch spices in this way.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.114
In other words, if their pinky got wet

21:22.948 --> 21:25.617
it would end up picking up too much spice.

21:26.827 --> 21:30.205
So, it was a custom created
to avoid bad etiquette.

21:31.331 --> 21:34.042
Do you understand, Mr. Guevaru?

21:34.126 --> 21:37.546
Humility. I'm sure you get it.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.883
The Japanese blood
that flows through your body

21:41.967 --> 21:46.555
calls for humility, the virtue
of the Land of the Rising Sun.

21:47.222 --> 21:51.768
So, how long are you going to continue
with your vulgar grip?

21:52.352 --> 21:54.146
Remember your humility.

21:54.229 --> 21:57.649
That's right, restore your pride.

23:47.843 --> 23:51.179
