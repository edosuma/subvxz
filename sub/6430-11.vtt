WEBVTT

00:00.321 --> 00:02.421
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:03.088 --> 00:05.224
Mrs. Frederic has a connection
to the Warehouse

00:05.256 --> 00:07.257
that even I don't
fully understand.

00:08.063 --> 00:11.132
This is Benedict Valda.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.533
He's one of the Regents.

00:12.601 --> 00:14.321
Paris, 1892.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.292
That's where I'd arranged
for my daughter, Christina,

00:16.360 --> 00:17.891
to spend the summer
with cousins.

00:17.958 --> 00:19.926
The men who came to rob
my cousins' home

00:19.994 --> 00:23.927
were expecting
an empty house.

00:23.995 --> 00:26.594
I imagine losing a child

00:26.662 --> 00:28.829
is the worst pain
a person can go through.

00:36.748 --> 00:40.554
Your breakfast is served,
milady.

00:40.621 --> 00:43.596
A banana?

00:43.663 --> 00:45.331
That's what you made me
for breakfast?

00:45.399 --> 00:48.269
Well, it's actually
half a banana,

00:48.337 --> 00:49.940
'cause I could only find one
in the kitchen,

00:50.008 --> 00:53.512
so we are going to
split it.

00:53.579 --> 00:55.381
You know, if we were
back at my place,

00:55.449 --> 00:57.253
I would have made you
chilaquiles for breakfast...

00:57.320 --> 00:59.255
In bed.

00:59.323 --> 01:02.760
Oh, <i>mi Amor.</i>

01:04.063 --> 01:06.499
You know how I love
your chilaquiles.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.034
And your bed.

01:11.142 --> 01:14.045
Maybe...Maybe it could be
our bed.

01:16.717 --> 01:19.652
Well, you know, Artie's really
strict about certain things.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.554
You know, he likes to
have all his Agents

01:21.622 --> 01:23.857
living under one roof,
you know, just in case--

01:23.925 --> 01:25.292
there's an irs emergency?

01:25.359 --> 01:27.427
Exactly. You get it.

01:27.495 --> 01:28.695
Sure.

01:28.763 --> 01:30.563
I gotta get back to work
anyway.

01:30.631 --> 01:31.732
Okay.

01:37.205 --> 01:38.172
Mmm!

01:38.240 --> 01:39.740
Oh, no, you di'n't!

01:39.808 --> 01:40.941
Hey, get back here!

01:41.009 --> 01:42.576
Don't. Hah. Hey.

01:45.780 --> 01:47.981
So what do you think?

01:48.049 --> 01:49.950
About you moving in
with Kelly?

01:50.018 --> 01:52.486
Well, yeah.
I mean, is it even kosher,

01:52.554 --> 01:55.791
you know, Warehouse-wise?

01:55.859 --> 01:57.961
Right.
I forgot who I was asking.

01:58.029 --> 01:59.129
What is that supposed
to mean?

01:59.197 --> 02:00.197
She's a tech nerd,

02:00.265 --> 02:01.433
she's 150,

02:01.500 --> 02:03.835
and you're...Myka.

02:03.903 --> 02:05.838
Not exactly relationship
success stories.

02:05.906 --> 02:07.840
Hey, I just got out
of a serious relationship.

02:07.908 --> 02:09.408
You didn't "get out."

02:09.477 --> 02:11.311
He had to change his identity
and move to a different state.

02:11.379 --> 02:13.547
By order of
the Justice Department!

02:13.614 --> 02:14.848
Point taken.

02:14.915 --> 02:16.683
I know a thing or two
about the opposite sex.

02:16.751 --> 02:18.551
Many of my lovers were men.

02:21.656 --> 02:24.524
We're gonna follow up on that
at a later date,

02:24.592 --> 02:27.126
but, for now, can we bring
the focus back round to <i>moi?</i>

02:27.194 --> 02:29.862
Okay, Pete, you just have to
ask yourself one question.

02:29.930 --> 02:33.667
I know. "Do I enjoy being
yelled at in <i>espanol?"</i>

02:33.735 --> 02:35.302
Do you love her?

02:37.072 --> 02:37.939
Yeah.

02:39.609 --> 02:41.376
I-I think so.

02:41.444 --> 02:43.446
I don't know.

02:43.514 --> 02:45.782
Okay, you're out to restaurant
and you order dessert.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.317
The waitress cuts it in half,

02:47.385 --> 02:49.586
one side is a little bit bigger
than the other.

02:49.653 --> 02:51.054
Which half do you give her?

02:51.122 --> 02:52.722
The bigger half, of course,
'cause otherwise--

02:52.790 --> 02:54.024
dude, you're screwed.
You love her.

02:54.092 --> 02:55.959
What? No! Shut--

02:56.027 --> 02:56.894
you're in love.

02:58.763 --> 03:01.665
Oh. Hi, Mrs. F.
Yeah.

03:01.733 --> 03:05.969
Well, apparently,
based on a dessert, I guess.

03:06.037 --> 03:07.237
I don't know.

03:07.305 --> 03:08.939
Me and the ladies
were just, uh...

03:12.043 --> 03:14.312
Uh, me and the ladies
were just

03:14.380 --> 03:16.881
you know, talking about
a personal thing that I have.

03:16.949 --> 03:19.218
Not that you would ever, pfft,
you know.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.787
So, if it's cool,
I'd just like to keep,

03:21.855 --> 03:25.391
you know, my personal stuff...
Personal.

03:25.459 --> 03:27.661
Nothing personal,
I mean, you know, to you.

03:27.728 --> 03:28.762
But, uh...

03:28.830 --> 03:30.431
Can I go now?

03:30.498 --> 03:32.766
One, Agent Lattimer.

03:32.834 --> 03:34.802
One what?

03:34.870 --> 03:36.237
Uh, "singular sensation"?

03:36.305 --> 03:37.972
"Is the loneliest number"?

03:38.040 --> 03:40.675
You are allowed to reveal
the true nature of our work

03:40.743 --> 03:42.577
to one person.

03:42.645 --> 03:45.247
So the question is
not whether you should live

03:45.314 --> 03:49.117
with Dr. Hernandez,
but, rather, is she your one?

03:57.295 --> 03:59.496
Man, it is good to be
out of that desert

03:59.564 --> 04:01.198
and back
amongst the living, huh?

04:01.265 --> 04:04.434
You know what?
I might start a harem.

04:04.502 --> 04:06.736
How many girls
are there in a harem?

04:06.804 --> 04:08.004
Uh...Three.

04:08.072 --> 04:09.706
Hold up,
I finally got a signal.

04:09.774 --> 04:11.275
Dude, no phone calls.

04:11.343 --> 04:13.611
Chill out, I'm just texting
a pic back to my sister.

04:13.679 --> 04:15.346
Yeah, well, no one's supposed
to know that we're here.

04:15.414 --> 04:16.615
She's eight.
Who's she gonna tell?

04:16.682 --> 04:17.916
John, you know the deal.

04:17.983 --> 04:19.451
Don't screw this up for us
just before we--

04:21.821 --> 04:23.388
You okay, bro?

04:28.928 --> 04:30.229
Yeah, just...

04:30.296 --> 04:31.430
Suddenly got real thirsty.

04:31.497 --> 04:33.398
You look kinda weird, man.
Terry?

04:35.101 --> 04:36.635
Dude, what's wrong?

04:36.702 --> 04:37.669
Dry!

04:37.737 --> 04:38.870
Dry!

04:42.407 --> 04:44.108
Somebody help us!

04:44.176 --> 04:46.744
Oh, my God. Rod?
We have to do something!

04:51.983 --> 04:54.785
Mrs. F., oh, my God.
Are you okay?

04:59.724 --> 05:01.258
Aah!

05:01.326 --> 05:03.827
Aah! Aah!

05:03.895 --> 05:05.462
Aah!

05:05.530 --> 05:07.598
Hey ,guys!
I need help in here!

05:07.666 --> 05:08.932
<i>Mooht pooh khesfet.</i>

05:09.000 --> 05:11.201
<i>Mooht pooh khesfet.</i>
Mrs. Frederic?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.903
What happened?

05:12.971 --> 05:14.505
One minute we were
just talking and then--

05:14.573 --> 05:17.441
<i>mooht pooh khesfet.</i>

05:57.985 --> 06:01.020
I do not speak gibberish,
Agent Lattimer.

06:01.088 --> 06:03.189
Okay, well,
not so much gibberish as...

06:03.257 --> 06:04.557
Creepy spooky blah blah.

06:04.625 --> 06:07.093
No, she's right.
It wasn't gibberish.

06:07.161 --> 06:09.796
It was one phrase
that you repeated over and over.

06:09.863 --> 06:11.598
<i>Mooht pooh khesfet.</i>

06:11.665 --> 06:13.500
It sounds
middle eastern in origin,

06:13.567 --> 06:14.834
maybe Aramaic
or an old form of Hebrew.

06:14.902 --> 06:19.073
It's demotic,
the tongue of ancient Egypt.

06:19.140 --> 06:21.108
Dead languages are a hobby.

06:21.176 --> 06:22.510
So what does it mean?

06:22.577 --> 06:24.112
Well, I'm not sure.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.414
It's been a while.

06:25.481 --> 06:27.917
According to the translation
program I get...

06:27.984 --> 06:30.586
"The penalty is death."

06:30.654 --> 06:33.155
What? What'd you set it on,
"extra scary"?

06:33.222 --> 06:35.758
To the best of my knowledge,
I do not speak demotic,

06:35.825 --> 06:38.126
so what artifacts
do we have from Egypt?

06:38.194 --> 06:40.462
Already on it.
Maybe it was dementia...

06:40.530 --> 06:42.431
That caused me to say that.

06:42.499 --> 06:43.699
We'll just keep going
through the manifest

06:43.766 --> 06:44.833
till we find the artifact--

06:44.901 --> 06:46.134
Holy synchronicity,
Batman.

06:49.439 --> 06:50.439
We just got a ping
from Egypt.

06:50.506 --> 06:51.407
What is it?

06:51.474 --> 06:53.509
Nothing good.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.284
Thanks so much
for talking to us

07:01.352 --> 07:03.320
about your son, Mrs. Tilson.

07:03.388 --> 07:05.556
We're very sorry to have
to ask you these questions.

07:05.624 --> 07:07.992
We know how difficult
this must be.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.295
So the body they found,

07:11.363 --> 07:14.164
they're sure then
that it was my John?

07:14.232 --> 07:16.733
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

07:16.801 --> 07:19.669
See, this doesn't
make any sense.

07:19.737 --> 07:21.638
John couldn't
have been in Egypt.

07:21.705 --> 07:23.039
John and his friends,

07:23.106 --> 07:25.541
they were working at
an archaeological dig in Peru.

07:25.609 --> 07:27.142
Peru?
Yes.

07:27.210 --> 07:28.844
He e-mailed me
from there last week.

07:28.912 --> 07:31.780
That's why this is insane.

07:31.848 --> 07:33.415
So he didn't say anything
about going to Egypt?

07:33.483 --> 07:34.850
No.

07:34.917 --> 07:36.151
Oh, God.

07:36.219 --> 07:40.355
I should call
Terry and Rod's parents.

07:40.423 --> 07:42.224
Maybe they...

07:44.194 --> 07:46.395
What happened to our children?

07:46.463 --> 07:50.734
Ma'am, we promise you,
we'll find out.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.242
Hello.

08:02.579 --> 08:04.713
You're John's little sister,
aren't you?

08:04.781 --> 08:07.116
That's a very lovely photo,
isn't it?

08:07.184 --> 08:09.118
They look very happy.

08:09.185 --> 08:10.118
May I?

08:13.890 --> 08:15.557
Oh, he's very handsome,
isn't he?

08:15.625 --> 08:18.160
And who is that lovely little
girl standing next to him?

08:18.227 --> 08:22.497
Gabrielle,
but everyone calls me Gabby.

08:22.565 --> 08:24.032
Hello, Gabby.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.433
Pleased to meet you.

08:25.501 --> 08:27.168
My name's Helena.

08:29.606 --> 08:32.841
I've got a little girl,
you know, about your age.

08:32.909 --> 08:38.648
Does she talk like you do?
She does.

08:38.715 --> 08:41.484
May I have a look
at your computer, please?

08:44.289 --> 08:46.824
That's your brother there,
isn't it?

08:51.129 --> 08:52.229
Myka.

08:55.299 --> 08:56.699
John's little sister
had the picture,

08:56.767 --> 08:58.668
but she didn't know
where he was.

08:58.736 --> 09:01.070
Why he suddenly left
an archeological dig in Peru

09:01.138 --> 09:03.138
to go to Egypt
is still a mystery.

09:03.206 --> 09:05.207
He sent her this photo.

09:15.619 --> 09:17.286
It can't be, can it?

09:17.354 --> 09:19.055
Don't make me ask.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.657
That would explain
a great deal.

09:20.725 --> 09:23.494
Claudia, that image,
print it out right now.

09:26.732 --> 09:27.999
Return with your team
immediately.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.234
Okay, but what do I tell--

09:33.004 --> 09:34.338
we have to confirm this.

09:34.406 --> 09:35.673
I'm this close to asking.

09:35.740 --> 09:38.242
The ancient archives.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.343
Go.
Yeah, bring the print.

09:40.411 --> 09:43.179
I hate myself
for doing this.

09:43.247 --> 09:45.315
What are
the ancient archives?

10:02.866 --> 10:03.866
Photo?

10:16.648 --> 10:17.982
Artie, what does it mean?

10:18.049 --> 10:19.383
The hieroglyphics
in this photo

10:19.451 --> 10:21.018
match the markings
right here,

10:21.086 --> 10:27.458
and it translate as
"an oasis between sand and Sea."

10:27.526 --> 10:29.394
What does that mean?

10:29.461 --> 10:32.130
It means that someone
has found the lost Warehouse.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.466
Someone's found Warehouse 2?

10:34.534 --> 10:36.468
How do you lose a Warehouse?

10:36.536 --> 10:39.438
It was always believed to be
somewhere near Alexandria.

10:39.506 --> 10:43.308
Back when the Romans were
conquering Egypt in 30 B.C.--

10:43.376 --> 10:45.845
31.
They had--

10:45.912 --> 10:49.549
they had very little time
to shut down Warehouse 2

10:49.616 --> 10:51.216
and transfer the artifacts,

10:51.284 --> 10:53.819
so the Agents of the time
buried it.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.087
Over time,
it was lost to the ages.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.589
I don't buy that
our three young Indiana Joneses

10:58.657 --> 11:00.458
just stumbled into it
for a school project.

11:00.525 --> 11:02.826
Neither do I.
It is rather unlikely.

11:02.894 --> 11:05.362
I think they must have broken
the seal on the door,

11:05.429 --> 11:07.564
and that activated...
A defense mechanism...

11:07.631 --> 11:09.365
And that's what caused them
later them to desiccate.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.501
Which is
when Warehouse 2 woke up.

11:11.569 --> 11:12.770
Woke up?

11:12.837 --> 11:14.504
You guys talk about it
like it's alive.

11:14.572 --> 11:16.440
Surely you know by now,
Agent Lattimer,

11:16.508 --> 11:20.078
the Warehouse is more organic
than your average structure.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.446
Warehouse 2 is back online.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.948
So it would appear.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.817
I still don't understand
why it's affecting you.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.553
When Warehouse 2 woke up,

11:27.621 --> 11:29.656
it began to look
for its caretaker,

11:29.723 --> 11:33.025
but its caretaker had been dead
for 2,000 years,

11:33.093 --> 11:36.228
so it found the caretaker
to the current Warehouse.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.297
And that's you?
You're the caretaker?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.165
Yes.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.600
Each Warehouse has a unique
bond with the caretaker,

11:42.668 --> 11:46.470
and now that bond is being
shared between two Warehouses.

11:46.538 --> 11:49.306
That was never
supposed to happen.

11:49.374 --> 11:50.674
Two networks, one server.

11:50.742 --> 11:53.277
My mind cannot take
the level of data being,

11:53.344 --> 11:56.948
as Ms. Donovan would put it,
downloaded.

11:57.015 --> 11:58.450
Eventually,
it will overload.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.052
And by overload, you mean...

12:04.525 --> 12:06.293
There is another difficulty.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.596
As Warehouse 2 continues
to eclipse my bond,

12:09.664 --> 12:12.900
Warehouse 13 will begin to...

12:12.968 --> 12:14.368
To die.

12:14.436 --> 12:17.605
So we need to find
Warehouse 2 and shut it down.

12:17.673 --> 12:19.074
I'll call the Regents.

12:19.141 --> 12:21.576
They will send
an expert to meet you in Egypt,

12:21.644 --> 12:23.545
who will help you
with Warehouse 2.

12:23.613 --> 12:24.847
All right,
don't worry, Mrs. F.

12:24.914 --> 12:26.115
We got this.

12:26.183 --> 12:27.383
Agent Lattimer,

12:27.451 --> 12:30.285
this is unlike anything
you've ever faced.

12:30.353 --> 12:32.822
So...Like always then.

12:53.645 --> 12:56.313
They said he'd be
wearing a Panama hat.

12:56.381 --> 12:58.616
That guy's got "Regent"
written all over him.

12:58.684 --> 13:00.485
That or "mug me,"
one of the two.

13:00.552 --> 13:03.188
That would be a mistake.

13:03.256 --> 13:05.257
The man who tried
to pick my pocket

13:05.325 --> 13:07.293
would soon wish he hadn't.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.564
Mr. Valda, you're
the expert on Warehouse 2?

13:11.632 --> 13:13.566
I am.

13:13.634 --> 13:16.502
And if Agent Lattimer here can
refrain from trying to kill me,

13:16.570 --> 13:19.739
we may even survive this.

13:33.402 --> 13:35.103
How did anyone ever find
this desolate place?

13:36.073 --> 13:37.874
Somehow those kids did.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.610
Looks like they planned on
coming back here.

13:40.678 --> 13:42.378
Well, they didn't
plan on dying.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.621
John's sister, Gabby.

13:53.689 --> 13:56.557
Your Christina
was about the same age.

13:56.625 --> 13:57.992
Yes, she was.

14:01.129 --> 14:03.063
Where on earth
did they get this?

14:03.131 --> 14:06.299
Maybe they thought
they were going to get rich.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.503
Instead, they got a deadly
faceful of hematite and natron.

14:09.570 --> 14:12.639
Basically,
they were mummified alive.

14:12.707 --> 14:14.275
But that's nothing compared
to the challenges

14:14.342 --> 14:16.610
that await us within.

14:16.678 --> 14:19.079
In Warehouse 2 mythology,

14:19.147 --> 14:20.781
one phrase shows up
over and over:

14:20.849 --> 14:23.917
"Mind, body, soul."

14:23.985 --> 14:25.853
So what is that, a code?

14:25.921 --> 14:27.756
When the security system
was activated,

14:27.823 --> 14:30.559
several traps came into play
to ward off intruders.

14:30.626 --> 14:33.529
Only fully trained Agents
of the time knew their secrets

14:33.597 --> 14:35.598
and how to navigate
them safely.

14:35.665 --> 14:38.935
So how does "mind, body, soul"
help us?

14:39.003 --> 14:41.638
That is for us
to discover together.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.240
Once at the center,

14:43.308 --> 14:47.444
we shut it down with this:

14:47.512 --> 14:48.579
One of the only things
to survive

14:48.646 --> 14:50.280
the burial of Warehouse 2.

14:55.954 --> 14:58.388
Then once more
into the breach, dear friends.

15:00.057 --> 15:03.226
I'll be right there.
I gotta make a call.

15:12.102 --> 15:14.103
What?

15:14.171 --> 15:15.404
I checked.

15:15.472 --> 15:17.006
This is what fashionable
british archaeologists

15:17.073 --> 15:18.606
are wearing nowadays.

15:18.674 --> 15:21.910
No, it's what
American filmmakers think

15:21.977 --> 15:23.444
fashionable british
archaeologists

15:23.512 --> 15:24.612
are wearing nowadays.

15:24.680 --> 15:28.249
Oh, really?

15:28.316 --> 15:30.818
Well, it is ever so comfy.

15:35.491 --> 15:36.991
Hi, this Dr. Hernandez.

15:37.059 --> 15:38.393
Please leave me a message.

15:39.562 --> 15:40.529
Hey, Kelly.

15:40.597 --> 15:41.730
Hey, it's, um...

15:41.798 --> 15:43.098
It's me, Pete.

15:43.166 --> 15:44.767
I'm sorry to call
so late there,

15:44.835 --> 15:46.636
but I'm about to go into a...

15:46.703 --> 15:49.105
Meeting, and--and, uh...

15:49.173 --> 15:51.108
You know, it's
going to be a tough meeting.

15:51.175 --> 15:53.177
You know, lots of...

15:53.245 --> 15:56.147
Bad meeting stuff, you know?

15:56.215 --> 15:57.649
So just, uh...

15:57.717 --> 16:00.586
Just-just in case, uh, that--

16:00.654 --> 16:03.423
I wanted to say that...

16:03.490 --> 16:06.258
I've been thinking about
you and I living together,

16:06.326 --> 16:08.093
and, um...And I think that--

16:08.161 --> 16:09.895
Automated voice:
Your time is up. Good-bye.

16:13.433 --> 16:14.834
That's what I'm afraid of.

16:21.174 --> 16:22.507
All right.

16:22.575 --> 16:24.075
Oh, my God,

16:24.143 --> 16:26.111
this looks like some kind
of torture device.

16:26.178 --> 16:27.745
It's a neural assessor.

16:27.813 --> 16:29.513
It will monitor my brain waves

16:29.581 --> 16:31.181
and track the degree
to which I'll being affected.

16:31.249 --> 16:35.185
Yeah, her wave discharges
have dropped considerably,

16:35.252 --> 16:38.221
and that indicates
an increase in the effect

16:38.288 --> 16:40.990
of the focal epileptiform
activity, and that means that--

16:41.057 --> 16:42.291
we've got
until this moon thingy

16:42.358 --> 16:44.059
scooches
over to this doodad?

16:44.127 --> 16:45.494
Yeah,
when the moon eclipses,

16:45.562 --> 16:48.698
that'll mean her brain
has reached its capa--

16:48.765 --> 16:50.533
just keep
an eye on the readout,

16:50.600 --> 16:53.236
let me know
if there are any changes.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.471
Artie, changes!
Changes!

16:56.808 --> 16:59.643
Male voice:
<i>Mooht pooh khesfet.</i>

16:59.711 --> 17:02.713
Artie, we're at the entrance.

17:02.781 --> 17:05.717
Valda's deactivating
the booby trap on the hatch.

17:05.784 --> 17:07.919
I've neutralized
the hematite.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.819
The kids never made it
past the entrance.

17:09.887 --> 17:11.288
That's it.

17:11.356 --> 17:13.290
Warehouse 2 sensed
an intruder.

17:13.357 --> 17:15.058
It's having
an effect on Mrs. Frederic.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.429
Valda says we're good to go.
We're heading in.

17:19.496 --> 17:23.333
Okay, go in,
but be careful and hurry.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.234
Mrs. Frederic
doesn't have much time.

17:51.363 --> 17:56.268
This totally blows
the King Tut exhibit away.

17:56.336 --> 17:58.637
What are we looking at?

17:58.705 --> 18:00.940
I'm not sure.

18:03.277 --> 18:04.977
That's not good.

18:05.045 --> 18:07.180
And you were right.

18:07.247 --> 18:09.816
Help me pry this open!

18:12.152 --> 18:14.387
Nope. It's
not gonna be that easy.

18:14.455 --> 18:16.489
Okay, uh,
"mind, body, soul."

18:16.557 --> 18:18.658
What if it's three clues,
instead of one?

18:18.726 --> 18:20.226
Three different traps,

18:20.294 --> 18:22.362
each one its own security device
that needs to be deactivated.

18:22.429 --> 18:24.464
Right, and this--
this is the first one: Mind.

18:24.532 --> 18:25.999
Yeah, as in,
"I mind if this place

18:26.066 --> 18:29.402
flattens us like pancakes."

18:31.505 --> 18:34.374
Okay, what if we used
one of these posts

18:34.441 --> 18:35.541
to brace the ceiling?

18:35.609 --> 18:37.477
No, no, Myka, Myka, Myka!
Wait!

18:37.544 --> 18:38.878
Pancakes!

18:38.946 --> 18:41.014
Do you ever think
about anything other than--

18:41.082 --> 18:42.048
no. This is like a game
I used to play

18:42.116 --> 18:43.349
at the pancake palace!

18:43.417 --> 18:45.518
This is the only hole
without a post, right?

18:45.586 --> 18:47.020
A game of wits,
a test of the mind.

18:47.087 --> 18:48.154
A kid's puzzle.

18:48.222 --> 18:49.755
Pete, how does it work?

18:49.823 --> 18:52.124
Okay, uh, we have to jump
each post like checkers,

18:52.192 --> 18:54.326
but in a certain pattern
till there's only one post left.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.961
No, if this is wrong--

18:56.029 --> 18:57.096
I won free banana walnut
pancakes

18:57.163 --> 18:58.564
every Sunday for a year.

18:58.631 --> 19:01.266
They had to discontinue
the contest.

19:01.334 --> 19:03.468
Myka, get the post
I just jumped.

19:03.536 --> 19:06.271
Okay.
He knows his pancakes.

19:07.539 --> 19:09.441
Okay.

19:09.508 --> 19:11.009
Okay.

19:11.077 --> 19:12.111
Valda.

19:15.449 --> 19:18.752
We gotta take these out in order
before the ceiling hits them.

19:18.820 --> 19:20.387
Oh! Okay. Okay.

19:20.455 --> 19:22.323
Okay, come on.

19:24.627 --> 19:26.828
I'm just chasing down
this money trail--

19:26.896 --> 19:27.929
<i>moot-kher-tou.</i>

19:27.997 --> 19:29.664
<i>Moot-kher-tou.</i>

19:29.732 --> 19:31.466
Claudia, can you
find out what that means?

19:31.533 --> 19:34.602
<i>Moot-kher-tou.</i>

19:34.670 --> 19:37.805
Artie.

19:37.873 --> 19:39.507
She's saying, "one must die."

19:39.574 --> 19:43.244
<i>Moot-kher-tou.</i>

19:46.897 --> 19:50.033
Pete!

19:54.372 --> 19:56.941
Unh!

19:57.009 --> 19:58.609
Ooh, ooh, God!

20:02.248 --> 20:03.315
Ahh!

20:03.333 --> 20:05.734
Okay, last one.

20:05.802 --> 20:06.769
Come on!

20:06.836 --> 20:08.570
God! God!

20:08.638 --> 20:12.507
Pete, hurry!

20:13.942 --> 20:15.909
It's getting faster!

20:15.977 --> 20:17.577
Hurry!

20:21.315 --> 20:23.082
Pete?

20:32.325 --> 20:35.461
Nicely done.
Bravo.

20:38.215 --> 20:41.651
That's right, dig it.

20:41.719 --> 20:43.353
Who solved
the test of the mind?

20:43.420 --> 20:44.421
Pete did!

20:44.489 --> 20:45.822
Wocka!

20:45.890 --> 20:47.758
Only because you order
off the children's menu.

20:47.826 --> 20:50.227
Somebody's buying me
pancakes for a year!

21:14.920 --> 21:17.723
Perhaps we're going to get
through this mission after all.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.528
Wow.
This couldn't get any worse.

21:26.433 --> 21:27.733
Thanks for that.

21:30.336 --> 21:33.071
Okay, there has to be some way
to shut this off.

21:33.139 --> 21:35.573
Well, maybe, uh...

21:35.641 --> 21:39.042
Maybe these hieroglyphs
are some kind of instructions.

21:39.110 --> 21:40.777
Um, let's see...

21:40.845 --> 21:42.979
Charlie Brown t-shirt,

21:43.047 --> 21:45.582
uh, hairy eyeball,

21:45.650 --> 21:46.817
foot.

21:46.884 --> 21:49.453
It's tahtib,
"the art of the way."

21:49.520 --> 21:51.689
Isn't that the ancient
egyptian martial art?

21:51.756 --> 21:53.891
Wah! Like karate?

21:53.959 --> 21:55.259
This is the body puzzle.

21:55.327 --> 21:57.529
So maybe this is "the way."

22:06.073 --> 22:08.541
Foom! Hoo! Hyah! Hee!

22:12.313 --> 22:13.813
Aah! Aah!

22:13.881 --> 22:16.583
Yii! Ahh.

22:17.338 --> 22:19.840
Okay, okay! That
is definitely not "the way"!

22:19.907 --> 22:21.876
That is impossible!

22:25.847 --> 22:27.447
Artie.

22:27.515 --> 22:29.082
Vanessa.

22:29.150 --> 22:32.185
Oh, I am so glad
that you're here.

22:32.253 --> 22:34.920
Well, glad
is hardly the word

22:34.988 --> 22:36.288
under the circumstances.
Oh, I know, I know.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.489
It's good to see you, too.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.257
I mean,
it's not good to see you,

22:39.325 --> 22:40.692
but we're
gonna get through this.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.160
Ahem.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.995
Oh, yes.

22:44.062 --> 22:46.797
Claudia,
this is Dr. Calder.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.332
Dr. Cal--
oh, Vanessa.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.101
Oh. Well, I've heard
a lot about you. A lot.

22:51.169 --> 22:52.469
Nice.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.706
Can we focus, please,
on more important things?

22:55.773 --> 22:56.707
Yes, of course.

22:56.774 --> 22:57.841
We'll talk later.

22:57.909 --> 22:59.542
Will hell be freezing over?

22:59.610 --> 23:01.077
Vanessa?
Oh.

23:01.145 --> 23:02.211
There you go.

23:05.483 --> 23:08.251
Maybe we should try and rise
above the situation.

23:13.758 --> 23:15.259
I think I know the way.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.903
I like
her "the way" better.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.471
Grappler,
don't leave home without it.

23:34.611 --> 23:38.214
"One must die."

23:38.282 --> 23:39.949
Shall we?

23:47.057 --> 23:48.590
Okay.

24:05.075 --> 24:07.610
The water bearer
holds the key.

24:07.678 --> 24:08.979
What does that mean?

24:09.046 --> 24:11.114
Just take this.

24:11.182 --> 24:13.317
Remember what I said.

24:13.384 --> 24:16.453
Wait a minute.
What, aren't you coming?

24:16.521 --> 24:17.754
I'm right behind you.

24:17.822 --> 24:19.823
Go!

24:19.891 --> 24:21.325
Go on, hurry!

24:21.392 --> 24:22.693
All right, all right,
all right.

24:39.709 --> 24:41.110
Quickly, Pete!

24:42.312 --> 24:44.379
Valda!

24:49.885 --> 24:52.186
Hold on!
I can make it back there!

24:52.254 --> 24:55.156
No! If you come back,
we both die!

24:55.224 --> 24:57.291
<i>Moot-kher-tou.</i>

24:57.359 --> 24:58.993
"One must die."

24:59.060 --> 25:01.795
This is as it must be.
Now go!

25:01.862 --> 25:03.429
We're not just
gonna leave you here!

25:03.497 --> 25:04.898
I won't give you
the choice.

25:11.539 --> 25:13.006
No!

25:26.449 --> 25:28.184
Why didn't he
let us help him?

25:28.251 --> 25:29.618
I don't know.
He read something

25:29.686 --> 25:31.721
on the wall back there.
It looked like it scared him.

25:31.788 --> 25:32.855
Can we even do this
without him?

25:32.923 --> 25:34.924
We have to.

25:36.894 --> 25:38.761
Look, we should tell Artie.
Let me call him.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.503
It's not working!

25:46.571 --> 25:48.339
Well, maybe we're
too far underground.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.788
It would seem
we go this way next.

26:14.330 --> 26:16.365
We have
to keep going, Pete.

26:16.433 --> 26:18.034
Yeah.

26:19.269 --> 26:20.536
Okay.

26:42.261 --> 26:44.829
Dr. Calder. Good.

26:44.897 --> 26:47.965
You know why I'm here?
I do.

26:48.033 --> 26:49.167
Artie?

26:51.103 --> 26:54.339
Your neural functions
are dropping.

26:56.442 --> 26:57.842
Are you in pain?

26:57.910 --> 26:58.910
Yes.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.079
Okay, come here.

27:02.147 --> 27:05.282
Claudia, something is
happening to the team in Egypt.

27:05.350 --> 27:07.718
Use my Farnsworth,
try to get a hold of them.

27:07.785 --> 27:10.987
Her connection with Warehouse
2 is getting stronger.

27:11.055 --> 27:12.522
I can't get a hold of them.

27:12.590 --> 27:15.358
I think maybe their Farnsworths
are out of range.

27:19.330 --> 27:20.530
I've got to check
on something.

27:20.598 --> 27:21.798
I'll be back.

27:21.866 --> 27:26.304
<i>Wennen...Wennen yefedu eem.</i>

27:26.371 --> 27:28.172
What is that?
What's she saying?

27:29.808 --> 27:32.009
"Where once there were four...

27:32.077 --> 27:34.011
Now there are three."

27:34.079 --> 27:38.883
<i>Ioo senooi er tenem.</i>

27:38.951 --> 27:41.820
Come on, come on.

27:45.825 --> 27:47.826
"And two will
lose their way."

28:04.276 --> 28:05.577
Little girl: Mummy?

28:09.482 --> 28:11.116
Pete?

28:11.183 --> 28:12.651
Kelly?

28:12.718 --> 28:14.119
Myka.

28:21.695 --> 28:22.996
Mummy?

28:23.063 --> 28:25.398
Christina?

28:42.681 --> 28:44.648
Myka.

28:44.716 --> 28:46.550
What's happening?

28:50.488 --> 28:52.222
Welcome back.

28:58.396 --> 29:02.866
A large americano
with an extra shot and room.

29:02.934 --> 29:04.301
My favorite.

29:12.178 --> 29:15.914
Christina?

29:15.982 --> 29:17.349
Is that really you?

29:27.027 --> 29:28.627
It's you.

29:28.695 --> 29:31.530
It's me, right here.

29:31.598 --> 29:34.233
No. I mean,
it's you.

29:34.301 --> 29:36.368
You're the one.

29:36.436 --> 29:37.636
You.

29:41.474 --> 29:43.642
Here's your next case.
It's a tough one.

29:43.710 --> 29:45.211
Lots of details,

29:45.279 --> 29:49.082
exactly the kind of thing
at which you excel.

29:49.150 --> 29:51.918
I can't wait for you
to tell me all about it.

29:56.090 --> 29:58.959
I've got you.

29:59.027 --> 30:00.427
I've got you, love.

30:02.063 --> 30:04.565
And I'll never let you go.

30:10.004 --> 30:12.840
I'm a secret service Agent,

30:12.907 --> 30:14.708
working
at a top-secret facility,

30:14.776 --> 30:17.377
hunting down mysterious
artifacts all around the world,

30:17.445 --> 30:20.413
and you are the only one
that I've ever told.

30:20.481 --> 30:22.749
It's okay.

30:22.816 --> 30:25.552
I'll always be
right here for you,

30:25.620 --> 30:29.622
and I can keep your secret
because I love you.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.858
Now, it seems like just
a series of random accidents

31:02.925 --> 31:04.259
there in
Great Falls, Virginia.

31:04.327 --> 31:05.561
Artie,
what's that doing there?

31:05.629 --> 31:08.331
What?
There's nothing there.

31:08.399 --> 31:09.599
That exit sign,
it's new.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.134
Very observant.

31:11.201 --> 31:13.336
That's my girl.

31:13.404 --> 31:14.837
Once you and Pete get
to Great Falls...

31:33.488 --> 31:34.721
How do you do?

31:34.789 --> 31:36.322
How do you do?

31:36.390 --> 31:38.558
Such a pretty little girl.

31:43.764 --> 31:45.365
Mummy?

31:45.433 --> 31:47.067
Artie, why are you
being so nice?

31:47.134 --> 31:49.669
I'm always nice.

31:49.737 --> 31:51.405
...Ish.

31:51.472 --> 31:52.873
You don't give compliments,

31:52.940 --> 31:54.341
and certainly
not with a smile.

31:54.409 --> 31:56.410
I'm getting more
in touch with my feelings.

31:56.478 --> 31:59.580
What's that exit sign
doing there?

31:59.648 --> 32:02.484
Well, come over here
and I'll show you.

32:02.552 --> 32:03.986
Come on.

32:04.053 --> 32:07.123
Myka, come right over here.

32:07.190 --> 32:08.825
Come on.

32:08.892 --> 32:10.093
Come here.

32:10.161 --> 32:11.695
Come on.
Come over here.

32:11.762 --> 32:13.897
No, this isn't real.

32:13.965 --> 32:17.400
This isn't...Real.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.368
This isn't real!

32:30.747 --> 32:32.848
Pete!

32:32.916 --> 32:35.350
H.G.!

32:39.256 --> 32:41.324
Pete! Wake up! Wake up!

32:41.392 --> 32:43.294
Pete?
Wait.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.800
H.G.! H.G.! Wake up!

32:49.868 --> 32:51.135
Mummy.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.303
Christina!

32:52.370 --> 32:56.574
Aah!

32:56.642 --> 32:57.942
What did you do?

32:58.010 --> 33:00.211
It's the soul test, okay?
It tricked us.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.546
It took us to
our happiest place

33:01.614 --> 33:06.985
and made us feel secure
so we wouldn't notice--

33:07.053 --> 33:09.588
it's the Medusa.

33:09.655 --> 33:10.589
The Medusa!

33:32.075 --> 33:34.142
Thanks.

33:36.346 --> 33:38.380
It's Kelly.

33:38.448 --> 33:39.681
What are you talking about?

33:39.749 --> 33:40.916
She's the one.

33:40.984 --> 33:42.384
Good.

33:42.452 --> 33:44.719
Yeah.

33:44.787 --> 33:46.154
We should keep moving.

33:48.691 --> 33:50.558
Helena?

33:54.663 --> 33:57.866
Helena, are you all right?

33:57.933 --> 34:01.369
My baby.

34:01.437 --> 34:03.705
My little baby.

34:03.773 --> 34:05.841
I'm so sorry.

34:08.543 --> 34:11.280
It was so real.

34:11.347 --> 34:13.715
Mrs. Frederic is dying.

34:13.783 --> 34:15.183
If we don't do this,

34:15.251 --> 34:17.018
Warehouse 13
could die with her.

34:17.085 --> 34:20.489
That's real, and we have
a chance to save her.

34:20.556 --> 34:24.793
Let's get this done.
Okay.

34:48.344 --> 34:51.413
We both know you
must be prepared to do

34:51.480 --> 34:52.580
what you've go to do.

34:52.648 --> 34:54.282
I know.

34:54.350 --> 34:55.516
Doesn't mean
I have to like it.

34:55.583 --> 34:58.086
What do you have to do?

34:58.154 --> 34:59.754
What is that?

35:05.529 --> 35:08.532
Claudia, we all want Pete
and Myka to succeed in Egypt.

35:08.599 --> 35:09.933
And they will.

35:10.001 --> 35:13.671
And if they don't
and if Mrs. Frederic dies

35:13.738 --> 35:15.072
while she's still
the caretaker,

35:15.140 --> 35:17.108
this Warehouse will begin
to close itself down.

35:17.176 --> 35:19.510
If the Warehouse
is to survive,

35:19.578 --> 35:23.781
then a new caretaker
must be in place before I die,

35:23.849 --> 35:26.785
and a new connection
must be made at that moment.

35:26.853 --> 35:29.055
A new connection...

35:29.122 --> 35:30.223
With who?

35:34.762 --> 35:37.264
Me.

35:38.933 --> 35:40.901
Okay.

35:40.968 --> 35:42.602
Uh...

35:42.670 --> 35:45.539
Flattering.

35:45.607 --> 35:47.641
But, um,

35:47.709 --> 35:48.742
why-why me?

35:48.810 --> 35:50.545
All of us have our purpose.

35:50.613 --> 35:53.848
I'm really
not ready for that.

35:53.916 --> 35:56.117
You will be
when the time comes.

35:56.185 --> 35:57.986
It's all part of the design.

35:58.054 --> 36:00.322
Won't I just wind up getting
my brain shredded, too?

36:00.390 --> 36:01.724
Mm-mmm.
No.

36:01.792 --> 36:04.761
When the connection
with Warehouse 2 is broken,

36:04.829 --> 36:07.532
Dr. Calder
can take precautions.

36:10.670 --> 36:13.105
Pete and Myka could
still shut down Warehouse 2.

36:13.173 --> 36:15.974
Yes, but there's
not much time left.

36:20.413 --> 36:25.718
<i>Senooi hem er tenem.</i>

36:27.687 --> 36:30.188
The tests are over.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.024
We made it.

36:32.091 --> 36:35.060
This must be
the ancient Artie's office.

36:39.131 --> 36:40.898
That's incredible.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.501
What is that?

36:45.771 --> 36:48.372
It's the only thing
here that's on.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.941
Yeah,
and not in a happy way.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.143
It's probably safe
to assume

36:52.210 --> 36:54.078
that's what's affecting
Mrs. Frederic.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.148
Wait.

37:09.094 --> 37:12.229
Ah ha ha.

37:12.297 --> 37:13.831
Totally awesome.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.099
My God.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.900
Magnificent.

37:21.172 --> 37:25.041
Okay, so how
do we turn this orb off?

37:25.109 --> 37:27.142
Well, this is
the control center.

37:27.210 --> 37:28.711
Let's turn it upside down.

37:28.778 --> 37:30.545
I should probably
go down to the Warehouse

37:30.613 --> 37:32.814
and see if there's a way
to switch it off down there.

37:35.484 --> 37:38.453
Myka, look at that.

37:42.325 --> 37:45.393
Okay,
it's a bunch of holes.

37:45.461 --> 37:48.763
Maybe what Valda gave me fits
into one of them.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.265
Like a key.

37:50.333 --> 37:54.035
That's what he said, a key.

37:54.103 --> 37:56.004
Come on, Mrs. F.,
hang on.

37:56.072 --> 37:58.340
We have to wait for Artie.
He'll know what--

37:58.408 --> 38:00.075
Claudia, we can't wait.

38:00.143 --> 38:01.877
It's time.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.993
<i>Wennen.</i>

38:15.060 --> 38:20.064
<i>Wennen yefedu eem.</i>

38:20.132 --> 38:23.468
<i>Ioo senooi er tenem.</i>

38:23.536 --> 38:26.337
Ferydice.

38:33.980 --> 38:35.080
It's just another puzzle,
Pete.

38:35.148 --> 38:36.682
I'm sure
we can figure it out.

38:40.587 --> 38:41.821
Wait a minute.

38:41.888 --> 38:43.689
Wait a minute.

38:43.757 --> 38:47.894
There's--there's something
about this. It looks...

38:47.962 --> 38:49.430
Maybe it's
like the mind test.

38:49.497 --> 38:52.500
We put the key in a series
of holes in a specific sequence.

38:52.568 --> 38:53.734
No, no. It's--

38:53.802 --> 38:56.537
it's something
about the...Pattern.

38:56.605 --> 38:58.939
It's...

38:59.007 --> 39:00.341
That's it!

39:00.409 --> 39:02.009
Myka, I know it.

39:02.077 --> 39:04.644
I need your wrist, please.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.646
Now, Claudia.

39:11.651 --> 39:12.818
That's the night sky.

39:12.886 --> 39:14.219
I used to study it
with my dad.

39:14.287 --> 39:15.720
Those are stars
look, there's the Big Dipper!

39:15.788 --> 39:16.922
That's Pisces,
and that's Aquarius.

39:16.989 --> 39:18.156
The water bearer.

39:18.224 --> 39:19.825
And the water bearer
holds the key!

39:31.369 --> 39:32.769
Come on, Pete,
you're almost there.

39:32.837 --> 39:35.906
Just--just one more inch.

39:35.973 --> 39:37.441
Aah!

39:37.508 --> 39:38.975
Oh!

39:46.384 --> 39:49.486
Ha! You did it!

39:49.553 --> 39:51.988
Wait!

39:52.056 --> 39:53.690
The connection's broken.

39:53.757 --> 39:55.925
They must have shut down
Warehouse 2.

39:55.992 --> 39:57.627
Yay!

39:57.694 --> 39:59.761
Victory lap!

39:59.829 --> 40:01.330
Uhh! See?

40:01.398 --> 40:03.265
I knew they'd come through.

40:03.333 --> 40:04.799
How do you feel?

40:04.867 --> 40:07.968
Well, I won't be running
a marathon any time soon.

40:08.036 --> 40:09.636
No, certainly
not in those heels.

40:12.707 --> 40:13.573
Myka. Myka.

40:16.310 --> 40:19.245
Thank you, dad.

40:23.217 --> 40:24.717
That's two I got,
you know.

40:24.785 --> 40:26.085
I know.

40:26.153 --> 40:29.089
You solved one,
and I solved two.

40:29.156 --> 40:30.958
I know.

40:31.026 --> 40:33.260
It's not a contest.
You're right. You're right.

40:33.328 --> 40:34.695
It's not a contest.

40:34.763 --> 40:37.065
But if it were...

40:37.133 --> 40:40.168
I'd be winning.

40:40.236 --> 40:44.340
Myka!
You have to see this!

40:54.210 --> 40:56.210
Dr. Calder.
Yeah?

40:56.667 --> 40:57.368
I'm really sorry.

40:57.393 --> 40:59.193
I didn't mean to come off
like a brat back there.

40:59.261 --> 41:01.662
I know you were just trying
to protect the Warehouse.

41:01.730 --> 41:03.564
Oh, honey, it's all right.

41:03.632 --> 41:05.400
Listen,
you are very young.

41:05.467 --> 41:08.369
You're entering a world
that is vastly more mysterious

41:08.437 --> 41:11.173
than any of us
can understand.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.107
I just want you
to know, though,

41:12.175 --> 41:13.809
that you will be ready.

41:13.877 --> 41:17.545
Remember that.

41:20.916 --> 41:23.985
Mm, tell Artie
I said good-bye.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.961
Maybe you
should be lying down.

41:33.029 --> 41:34.729
Maybe you should brief me

41:34.797 --> 41:36.865
on what was happening
while I was ill.

41:36.932 --> 41:38.533
Ah.
You found my little project.

41:38.601 --> 41:39.535
I did.

41:39.602 --> 41:40.536
Tell me.

41:40.603 --> 41:42.771
Okay, um...

41:42.839 --> 41:44.407
Well, something's been
eating at me

41:44.474 --> 41:45.808
since we got the ping.

41:45.876 --> 41:47.310
You know, those guys
who were mummy-tized,

41:47.378 --> 41:48.945
they're college kids.
They're not rich,

41:49.013 --> 41:51.148
but they went to Egypt,
they staged this huge dig.

41:51.216 --> 41:52.883
That had to cost
a chunk of change.

41:52.951 --> 41:56.421
You think someone hired them
to find and enter Warehouse 2.

41:56.489 --> 41:58.991
Someone with long arms
and deep pockets.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.560
You know, I find the source,
we find the bad guy.

42:01.627 --> 42:03.996
Enterprising.
I'm impressed, Ms. Donovan.

42:04.064 --> 42:06.765
And your research came up
with something.

42:06.833 --> 42:08.634
I got a ping?
Yes, you got a ping.

42:09.903 --> 42:11.437
That can't be right.

42:11.504 --> 42:14.607
The money that was used to hire
those students, it's from...

42:14.675 --> 42:16.142
It's from Warehouse 13.

42:18.812 --> 42:19.846
Where's Arthur?

42:19.913 --> 42:21.614
I don't know.

42:21.682 --> 42:26.319
He said he'd be right back,
but that was hours ago.

42:26.387 --> 42:28.721
H.G., guess who
just saved the day, again!

42:28.789 --> 42:29.956
Actually,
it was pretty amazing,

42:30.024 --> 42:31.291
with the night sky.

42:31.358 --> 42:32.558
Yeah, yeah, there were
all these holes,

42:32.626 --> 42:34.894
and they were actually stars!
Stars, and--

42:34.962 --> 42:37.497
Helena?

42:37.565 --> 42:39.266
I do hope you can
forgive me.

42:39.333 --> 42:40.968
For what?

42:41.035 --> 42:42.703
This.
