Come here, buddy.

<i>It's exciting
to get a new tiger.</i>

00:07.074 --> 00:09.041
Oh, my goodness.

<i>They certainly do what

00:11.579 --> 00:12.878
Where you goin'?

00:13.446 --> 00:14.847
[Martha Hiatt] Hi, puppy.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.849
<i>We want her
to be comfortable with us</i>

00:16.851 --> 00:19.585

when she gets to her new home.

00:19.587 --> 00:23.622
[Lindsey VanSchoick] What do you
think, Sid? This is your new family. Oh.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.624
- She's showin' off right now.
- [Martha] Yeah, she is showin' off.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.121
<i>[man] They really enjoy this.</i>

00:56.123 --> 00:59.358

I know, you don't like doors.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.694
[woman] Go on, ladies.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.263
<i>[Jim] It's not enough

01:04.265 --> 01:06.231
<i>in exhibits just for people
to look at.</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:07.833
<i>There has to be
a higher purpose.</i>

01:07.835 --> 01:11.437
<i>And for us, it's conservation

01:11.439 --> 01:12.771

All the way. Good.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.251
<i>The training sets
are important for us</i>

<i>and make sure everything
is okay with them.</i>

03:10.391 --> 03:11.857

with Julian</i>

03:29.577 --> 03:30.809
<i>since he was about
two years old,</i>

03:30.811 --> 03:33.278
<i>so I've definitely had
a number of years with him</i>

<i>and our relationship is just
really a product of all that time.</i>

Up.

Good boy.

<i>Currently, we have four tigers
here at Tiger Mountain.</i>

<i>It's always exciting
to have a new tiger,</i>

<i>but it's absolutely
starting from scratch.</i>

03:58.639 --> 04:01.840
<i>I have to form a relationship
from absolutely nothing</i>

04:01.842 --> 04:04.343
and build that up
to something really positive.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.179
[tiger growling]

04:07.181 --> 04:09.881
[Pat] All right, pretty girl.
That's all right.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.851
- [growling continues]
- All right, sweetie.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.989
We're receiving a young,
female Amur tiger

04:16.991 --> 04:19.891
named Aurora
from the Minnesota Zoo.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.294
<i>Aurora came here
as a recommendation</i>

04:22.296 --> 04:24.363
<i>from the
Tiger Species Survival Plan.</i>

04:24.365 --> 04:27.132
<i>And the goal will be
to eventually breed her here.</i>

04:27.134 --> 04:30.135
<i>Amur tigers are native
to the Russian Far East,</i>

04:30.137 --> 04:33.005
<i>Northern China
and the Korean Peninsula.</i>

04:33.007 --> 04:35.440
<i>They were classified
as endangered.</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:37.509
<i>So it's important
that zoos work together</i>

04:37.511 --> 04:39.478
to maintain healthy populations.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.681
- [man] Yeah, support the back.
- [woman] Got it.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.017
<i>We're going to be moving her
into the Wildlife Health Center</i>

04:45.019 --> 04:46.885
where she'll undergo
her quarantine.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.357
That's okay, sweetheart.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.059
[surf rock playing]

04:56.496 --> 04:59.831
[Pat] Ready. One, two, three.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.869
<i>We've unloaded many tigers,
lions, other big cats,</i>

05:03.871 --> 05:06.605

what to do.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.443
[woman] You guys good?

05:11.445 --> 05:14.179
<i>[Pat] She's obviously
a little bit nervous</i>

05:14.181 --> 05:16.214
<i>and she's not happy.</i>

05:16.216 --> 05:17.949
[tiger growls]

05:17.951 --> 05:20.519
<i>And so, the goal is
to just give her access</i>

05:20.521 --> 05:24.056
to her quarantine area as
quickly and quietly as we can.

05:24.757 --> 05:25.924
[tiger roars]

05:25.926 --> 05:27.759
All right, sweetheart.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.294

- Yeah.

05:37.271 --> 05:38.437
<i>I love all big cats,</i>

05:38.439 --> 05:40.605
<i>but tigers in particular,
I mean,</i>

<i>they're just majestic looking,
they're powerful,</i>

05:43.344 --> 05:45.010
they're very confident.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.845
[growling]

05:46.847 --> 05:49.381
<i>And then, as she begins
to settle down</i>

05:49.383 --> 05:52.351
<i>the keepers will begin
to spend time with her.</i>

05:52.353 --> 05:57.222
And we'll just let that relationship
progress at Aurora's speed.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.524

I'm about to go and give
them their morning meal.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.883
[bird calls]

06:29.856 --> 06:31.923
Birds-of-paradise are
predominantly omnivores.

06:31.925 --> 06:35.093
Fruits, vegetables, bugs are
pretty much their main diet.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.461
[bird call]

06:36.463 --> 06:37.796
Hi, bud.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.500
Oh, you found one.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.336
This is one of our female
lesser birds-of-paradise,

06:44.338 --> 06:45.537
Fortune.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.740
Here at the World of Birds,
we have

06:48.742 --> 06:51.109
three different species
of birds-of-paradise.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.011
We have lesser.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.180
We have Raggiana.

06:55.182 --> 06:58.083
And we have
red bird-of-paradise.

06:58.085 --> 07:02.087
These species have their
own variation of color plumage...

07:02.089 --> 07:03.655
[bird calls]

07:03.657 --> 07:05.824
vocalization
that distinguish themselves

07:05.826 --> 07:07.159
from each species.

07:07.161 --> 07:10.395
[bird calls]

07:10.397 --> 07:12.397
Lot of noise. [chuckles]

07:13.499 --> 07:17.469
[bird calling] Hi.
You hungry?

07:17.471 --> 07:21.373
<i>We're really excited, our red
bird-of-paradise have been recently nesting</i>

07:21.375 --> 07:23.442
and one of our females
has laid two eggs.

07:24.343 --> 07:26.545
<i>This female has a history of</i>

07:26.547 --> 07:29.581
<i>only being capable of raising
one of the two chicks.</i>

07:29.583 --> 07:31.416
<i>So our female still has one egg</i>

07:31.418 --> 07:33.585
<i>and she's living off exhibit
in the conservation building.</i>

07:33.587 --> 07:35.687
<i>Privacy is very important,
so she can focus</i>

07:35.689 --> 07:37.422
<i>all her energy
on that one chick.</i>

07:37.424 --> 07:39.257
And then we've pulled the other,

07:39.259 --> 07:42.294
<i>artificially incubated it
in our egg room,</i>

07:42.296 --> 07:43.995
<i>and then once
it started to hatch,</i>

07:43.997 --> 07:45.330
<i>we've moved it up
to the brooder room</i>

07:45.332 --> 07:47.732
<i>where it could be hand-raised.</i>

07:47.734 --> 07:50.836
[Ken] Today's day three. So
it just hatched a few days ago.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.371
[woman speaking]

07:53.373 --> 07:54.840
[Dr. John] He's been
breathing okay?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.374
He's not been
breathing rapid or...

07:56.376 --> 07:58.410
- Yeah, I haven't seen any of that.
- or anything like that.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.615
But usually with red birds-of-paradise,
they're far more active,

08:03.617 --> 08:05.116
they're really strong
from the start,

08:05.118 --> 08:06.585
and this one hasn't been.

08:06.587 --> 08:10.455
It's just the lethargy
is a little concerning.

08:10.457 --> 08:14.392
He's also been kind of wrinkly
skinned, maybe a little dehydrated too.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.894
Okay.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.597
<i>[Ken] When birds are really
small and young,</i>

08:18.599 --> 08:21.733
they're very fragile.

08:21.735 --> 08:25.637
<i>Sometimes there's
a failure to thrive.</i>

08:25.639 --> 08:28.773
<i>And it's just what would
happen naturally in the wild.</i>

08:28.775 --> 08:31.409
<i>But the positives
of hand rearing</i>

08:31.411 --> 08:32.477
is that we can catch that early

08:32.479 --> 08:33.578
and do something about it.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.881
<i>So we have our vet here</i>

08:35.883 --> 08:39.651
<i>and we're gonna administer
some fluids and an antibiotic.</i>

08:39.653 --> 08:41.820
[Dr. Hannah] Hi, little one.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.489
[Ken] Let's try, kind of,
the side of the leg first.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.791
Red birds-of-paradise are
found in Papua New Guinea.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.628
<i>Like a lot of island species,</i>

08:49.630 --> 08:52.664
<i>red birds-of-paradise
are threatened in the wild</i>

08:52.666 --> 08:54.933
<i>because of habitat loss.</i>

08:54.935 --> 08:58.370
<i>So it's important
to learn about the species</i>

08:58.372 --> 09:02.541
that, you know, we may one
day need to save in the wild.

09:02.543 --> 09:06.111
[Dr. Hannah] Oh, so brave.
Oh, I know.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.946
[Ken] That's pretty encouraging,

09:07.948 --> 09:11.349
even getting a little bit
of a gape there at all.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.786
<i>The red bird-of-paradise chick will
be monitored over the next few days.</i>

09:14.788 --> 09:17.188
<i>We'll take her weight,
we'll keep close eye on it,</i>

09:17.190 --> 09:18.490
<i>and we'll see how it does.</i>

09:18.492 --> 09:20.258
Give us an update
this afternoon.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.860
- [Ken] Perfect.
- [man] Thank you.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.662
- All right. Thanks very much.
- [Dr. Hannah] Thank you.

09:24.997 --> 09:27.832
[funky music playing]

09:35.675 --> 09:37.175
Hey-hey-hey.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.177
What are you looking at?

09:41.847 --> 09:44.649
<i>[Caitlin] So this is everything
that the harbor seals will eat</i>

09:44.651 --> 09:47.686
<i>throughout the day.
Capelin, herring and squid.</i>

09:47.688 --> 09:50.889
Since our nourishment is ready
we're going to carry it out to exhibit

09:50.891 --> 09:53.425
<i>and give it to our harbor seals.</i>

09:57.330 --> 09:58.496
Oh, watch your face.

10:02.735 --> 10:04.169
Hey, bug.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.971
<i>In the wild, you would
definitely see them</i>

10:05.973 --> 10:07.606
<i>foraging around.</i>

10:07.608 --> 10:09.441
<i>These enrichment items
can help enhance</i>

10:09.443 --> 10:12.310
<i>their environment
in that they need to interact</i>

10:12.312 --> 10:13.945
<i>and kind of forage
through these toys</i>

10:13.947 --> 10:16.181
<i>to find the fish that
they're trying to get.</i>

10:16.183 --> 10:17.882
Oh, my God, you're cute.

10:19.852 --> 10:21.987
Hey! Look at this!

10:30.030 --> 10:31.963
<i>I love working
with harbor seals.</i>

10:31.965 --> 10:34.366
They are very sweet,

10:34.368 --> 10:36.801
they're fun to interact with,
they're very playful.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.070
[seals chirping]

10:40.673 --> 10:43.875
[Payden] The one playing with
the toy in the back, that's Coral.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.443
She's about 11 years old.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.780
She's the mom of Murphy.
Murphy's right in front of me.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.815
She's our youngest.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.851
Murphy is eight months old.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.120
She's usually pretty active.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.522
[Caitlin] Every animal has
their own personality,

10:57.524 --> 11:02.060
so it's really fun just getting to
know each animal individually.

11:02.062 --> 11:05.096
[Payden] Look at you two
playing together.

11:06.265 --> 11:09.534
Oh. Oh. Oh, dear. [chuckles]

11:09.536 --> 11:11.736
Here at the aquarium,
we currently have

11:11.738 --> 11:15.840
four harbor seals
out on exhibit.

11:15.842 --> 11:19.678
<i>And we are so excited that
in the next couple of weeks</i>

11:19.680 --> 11:23.014
our population of seals
is about to change.

11:23.016 --> 11:27.686
<i>We will be picking up a Pacific
harbor seal from California.</i>

11:27.688 --> 11:29.220
<i>Her name is Sidney.</i>

11:29.222 --> 11:32.590
<i>She was rescued
from the Pacific Coast</i>

11:32.592 --> 11:34.759
and she's about
eight months old.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.629
So she's going to be
a good buddy for Murphy,

11:37.631 --> 11:40.265
because they're within
a few months of each other.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.767
- [Payden] Oh, hi, Murph.
- [Caitlin] Hi, little Murph.

11:42.769 --> 11:47.539
<i>[Martha] The seals we have now
have been together for about three years</i>

11:47.541 --> 11:50.575
<i>and so they are
a very tight group.</i>

11:50.577 --> 11:53.745
<i>I hope Sidney fits right in
without any issues.</i>

11:53.747 --> 11:56.448
[Payden] You're going to meet
a new friend. That's fun.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.154

<i>our female Amur tiger, Aurora,</i>

12:05.759 --> 12:07.092
was a little bit nervous.

- There we go. Good girl.
- Good girl.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.560
- You ready to go outside?
- It's time to go to the pool.

12:42.562 --> 12:46.564
<i>[Michele] Sidney is a harbor
seal pup and she's nine months.</i>

12:47.500 --> 12:50.268
<i>Sidney was found
abandoned in a cave.</i>

- [man] Got her?
- She's so small.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.541
<i>We believe Sidney was abandoned
because she was premature.</i>

12:56.543 --> 13:00.478
<i>We're not sure if the mother
was a first-time mom.</i>

13:00.480 --> 13:02.680
<i>We were feeding
around the clock.</i>

13:02.682 --> 13:05.683
<i>It was like intensive care
for about the first two weeks</i>

13:05.685 --> 13:08.353
<i>till she kind of stabilized.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.222
[Lindsey] Whee! You can do it.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.991
All right.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.560
<i>[Michele] Sidney's made
a great turn around.</i>

13:15.562 --> 13:17.362
She's you know,

13:17.364 --> 13:20.098
she's interacting with people,
she swims.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.335
[chuckles]

13:24.337 --> 13:25.970
[Lindsey] Sidney is
definitely special.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.007
Wild harbor seals are
usually not this social.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.576
Good girl. Good girl.
That's a good spot.

13:31.578 --> 13:35.613

Ready to meet Sid?

13:42.656 --> 13:45.824
- [Martha] Yes, we've been waiting.
- [Dr. Hiatt] Definitely.

- [Lindsey] Sidney.
- [Martha laughs]

13:47.861 --> 13:50.495

13:50.497 --> 13:54.299
[Martha] Hi, puppy. Oh,
my God. She's so cute.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.134
[Michele] Look at those eyes.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.537
[Lindsey] Say hello.
This is your new family.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.806
<i>[Martha] Dr. Hiatt and I
came out here early</i>

- She's very inquisitive.

14:16.723 --> 14:19.490
Sid, are you ready to play?

14:19.492 --> 14:23.261
- Here.
- [Martha] Oh, Nice.

[Michele] She almost,

14:25.332 --> 14:27.065
-[Martha] Really?
-[Michele] She'll bring it back.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.900

14:28.902 --> 14:30.535
Good girl.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.325
<i>that she probably
could never be released,</i>

14:54.327 --> 14:58.296
<i>because she was so young

14:58.298 --> 15:02.133

off right now.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.108
[Martha] She's a good girl.

<i>from the Wildlife Health

15:53.887 --> 15:56.220
It's exciting to get a new tiger

especially 'cause each and every
one of them have their own personality.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.861

know she's a little bit grumpy

16:50.309 --> 16:52.577
<i>[Colleen] Each animal
is different</i>

16:52.579 --> 16:54.746
<i>and what we learned very
quickly was that Aurora</i>

16:54.748 --> 16:58.249
was a little bit nervous
and a little bit scared.

16:58.251 --> 17:02.353
<i>Typically, we would want to set
up a crate and crate train them</i>

17:02.355 --> 17:04.288
<i>and then move them awake.</i>

17:04.290 --> 17:06.691
<i>Given that Aurora was taking
a lot of time to get</i>

17:06.693 --> 17:08.459
comfortable with everyone,

17:08.461 --> 17:11.662
uh, we decided to shorten
that process and opted to

17:11.664 --> 17:14.298
<i>anaesthetize her and now</i>

17:14.300 --> 17:16.834
the goal is to get her

<i>[Colleen] Any time you are
immobilizing a large carnivore,</i>

<i>[Colleen] You want to make sure
that the people that are in the van</i>

medications we need to keep her sedate.

- very good friends.

<i>[Colleen] And that is
something you can't</i>

18:16.529 --> 18:18.196
<i>put on a time scale.</i>

18:18.198 --> 18:19.931
That completely depends on

18:19.933 --> 18:21.899
how comfortable
Aurora is with her keepers

18:21.901 --> 18:23.668
and how patient they are

We want her to learn
how to eat by herself

20:00.867 --> 20:04.035

to always hand-feed her.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.381
[whimsical instrumental music

sad that it's growing up too fast.

Being able to care for this
chick is very challenging.

21:02.795 --> 21:08.766

are able to see it step by step every day.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.234
Makes me feel very proud.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.404
Let's see if she wants
a little bit more.

21:13.406 --> 21:16.607
<i>In the next few weeks,
I'm going to be working on</i>

21:16.609 --> 21:19.310
<i>teaching her how to eat
on her own.</i>

21:19.312 --> 21:22.980
<i>Eventually, Sally-Anne
will be moved downstairs</i>

21:22.982 --> 21:26.250
to be next to a chick
that's her age

21:26.252 --> 21:27.418
for socializing.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.520
I'm happy for her.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.392
[cheerful music playing]

21:46.338 --> 21:48.606
[man on radio]

21:48.608 --> 21:51.142
Yup, William, we are behind
the Health Center.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.910
We're good to go.

21:52.912 --> 21:56.480
Sidney, the harbor seal
is coming to us

21:56.482 --> 21:58.749
from California.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.518
<i>The team went out
to pick her up,</i>

22:00.520 --> 22:03.220
<i>and they're bringing her here
to the New York Aquarium.</i>

22:03.222 --> 22:06.757
- [Martha] Yay!
- Yay, we made it.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.759
Whoo-hoo! Finally.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.062
<i>[Martha] It was a long day.</i>

22:11.064 --> 22:13.264
<i>We started two o'clock
this morning</i>

22:13.266 --> 22:14.899
<i>in Laguna loading her up</i>

22:14.901 --> 22:16.367
<i>taking her to LAX.</i>

22:18.437 --> 22:21.839
And we are finally,
finally here.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.376
[Caitlin]
I'm excited to get her out.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.844
I want to meet her.
[laughs softly]

22:26.846 --> 22:29.113
[Martha] Keep coming. Stop.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.949
[man] That's good.
Thank you.

22:34.753 --> 22:36.587
One, two, three.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.123
Hi, Sidney.

22:43.962 --> 22:46.397
Hi, baby girl.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.999
<i>Transports are tough,
but she made it.</i>

22:49.001 --> 22:51.235
She looks fantastic.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.938
[Payden] You got some
curly whiskers, girlfriend.

22:55.006 --> 22:56.607
You're adorable.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.476
You're so pretty.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.945
<i>[Caitlin] She's definitely
very curious,</i>

23:00.947 --> 23:03.381
<i>very into checking out
her new surroundings</i>

23:03.383 --> 23:06.584
<i>which is good to see, so she
looked really bright and alert.</i>

23:08.920 --> 23:10.721
You go, girl.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.357
- Nice job.
- You got it.

23:14.459 --> 23:17.027
- You got it, Sidney.
- [Payden] Oh, my God.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.397
- I know, it's such a big step.
- She's falling.

23:19.399 --> 23:23.401
<i>[Caitlin] Our plan for Sidney was
to spend the night in a larger tub.</i>

23:23.403 --> 23:25.603
[grunts]

23:25.605 --> 23:28.773
<i>But she was showing us that
she was having difficulty</i>

23:28.775 --> 23:30.441
<i>getting in and out of that tub.</i>

23:30.443 --> 23:33.210
Ooh! She's out.
You're okay.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.979
<i>So we are going
to have to change up</i>

23:34.981 --> 23:37.648
<i>our plans a little bit
and give her access to</i>

23:37.650 --> 23:39.817
<i>a smaller tub
that will be easier</i>

23:39.819 --> 23:42.453
for her to get
in and out of for tonight.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.488
Oh, a tub your size.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.290
- That's lovely.
- [chuckles]

23:46.292 --> 23:48.426
She's like, "I can do this."

23:48.428 --> 23:50.628
This one's not as hard.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.130
There you go.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.866
[Caitlin] <i>Sidney will stay
here in our hospital area</i>

23:55.868 --> 23:58.202
<i>in quarantine for 30 days.</i>

23:58.204 --> 24:00.438
During that time, we'll just
kind of get her used to

24:00.440 --> 24:02.339
seeing us
and interacting with us.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.508
Whoo! I like the way
you travel.

24:04.510 --> 24:05.543
I know.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.144
<i>[Caitlin] And just start
building</i>

24:07.146 --> 24:09.280
<i>our relationship
with her day by day.</i>

24:09.282 --> 24:12.950
Oh, she cuddles.
Hi, sweet girl.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.618
- Goodbye.
- Oh, my gosh.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.586
[chuckles]

24:16.588 --> 24:18.322
[Taryn] Hi, little lady.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.291
<i>It's been a while since
I've had to develop</i>

24:20.293 --> 24:22.860
<i>a whole new relationship with
a completely different tiger.</i>

24:22.862 --> 24:23.961
Come on.

24:23.963 --> 24:24.995
<i>She's trying to learn me.</i>

24:24.997 --> 24:26.363
<i>And I'm trying to learn her.</i>

24:26.365 --> 24:27.832
What a brave girl.

24:33.738 --> 24:34.805
[moans]

24:35.740 --> 24:37.374
What a cutie.

24:38.577 --> 24:39.577
[grumbles softly]

24:43.582 --> 24:45.149
[Kathleen] And they ate well
this morning?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.051
[Tye] Yeah, they ate
really well this morning.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.253
[Kathleen] Hey, little ones.

24:51.122 --> 24:53.657
Aren't they the cutest?

24:53.659 --> 24:56.527
[Tye] Already starting to see
what's going on.

24:56.529 --> 24:59.830
So this is the milk
for the sand cats.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.000
So we'll try feeding them now.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.103
Hi, cutie pie.
What are you doing?

25:06.105 --> 25:09.573
<i>We received the sand cats
from the Columbus Zoo.</i>

25:09.575 --> 25:11.575
<i>They're just shy of 40 days.</i>

25:11.577 --> 25:14.011
<i>The sand cats are technically
in quarantine</i>

25:14.013 --> 25:17.381
<i>but also cats are very
vulnerable to human disease.</i>

25:17.383 --> 25:19.083
<i>So we're just
being extra careful</i>

25:19.085 --> 25:20.918
<i>to make sure these guys
are nice and healthy.</i>

25:21.653 --> 25:22.786
[mews]

25:22.788 --> 25:23.921
I hear you, guys.

25:25.156 --> 25:26.891
Hey, little one.

25:26.893 --> 25:29.527
<i>This is Draco, the male.</i>

25:29.529 --> 25:33.197
<i>So the male's bigger and he
also has the stripes on his tail,</i>

25:33.199 --> 25:34.932
<i>the darker markings.</i>

25:36.234 --> 25:38.936
<i>And this is Luna.</i>

25:38.938 --> 25:42.806
Sand cats can be found in
the Sahara Desert in Africa,

25:42.808 --> 25:45.609
the Arabian Peninsula
and parts of Asia.

25:45.611 --> 25:48.078
Hi, little one. Good girl.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.782
<i>Fifteen years ago,
we had sand cats on exhibit,</i>

25:51.784 --> 25:54.485
<i>so it's been a while.</i>

25:54.487 --> 25:56.086
<i>They're really, really cool.</i>

25:56.088 --> 25:57.821
[Tye] They suck on that well.

25:57.823 --> 26:00.324
<i>[Kathleen] I think everyone,
when they think wild cats,</i>

26:00.326 --> 26:03.427
think of the cheetah,
the lions and tigers.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.429
But most of the wild cats
are small.

26:05.431 --> 26:08.065
<i>And these are a very
small wild cat.</i>

26:08.067 --> 26:09.466
<i>One of the smallest species.</i>

26:09.468 --> 26:12.269
<i>They don't get to be more
than six pounds.</i>

26:13.171 --> 26:14.572
Are you done?

26:14.574 --> 26:16.240
- You want to let him run a little bit?
- Yeah.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.043
Let's let 'em
blow off some steam.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.745
- Thank you, Tye.
- You're welcome.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.281
Look at him.
Look at him stalk. Boom!

26:24.283 --> 26:25.816
[chuckles]

26:27.485 --> 26:29.186
She's getting bold.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.088
<i>After the health center,</i>

26:31.090 --> 26:33.657
the sand cats are going to be
programmed animals.

26:34.392 --> 26:35.626
[Jim] Hey.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.161
[Kathleen] Cuties.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.630
[Jim] Look at them.
They're ready.

26:39.632 --> 26:42.099
[Kathleen chuckles]

26:42.101 --> 26:44.234
<i>Like other species, sand
cats are always going to be</i>

26:44.236 --> 26:46.003
<i>threatened by habitat loss,</i>

26:46.005 --> 26:49.139
by hunting, by collection
for the pet trade.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.642
<i>So it gives us an opportunity
to talk about them.</i>

26:51.644 --> 26:53.210
<i>Also, we might participate</i>

26:53.212 --> 26:55.079
with a breeding program
based on what

26:55.081 --> 26:58.048
the Species Survival Plan
wants us to do.

26:58.050 --> 27:01.518
[Jim] I like when they climb on
you like you're an inanimate object.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.387
[Kathleen chuckles]

27:03.389 --> 27:04.521
[Kathleen] Luna.

27:06.091 --> 27:07.391
Whoa, look at that.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.059
[Kathleen chuckles]

27:09.061 --> 27:12.663
[Jim] <i>I think it's nice when
an animal chooses to engage</i>

27:12.665 --> 27:14.898
<i>with you, then it's easier
to kind of build</i>

27:14.900 --> 27:17.234
<i>a relationship from there.</i>

27:17.236 --> 27:19.303
[Kathleen] I think people
are going to like 'em.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.571
[Jim] They're pretty cute.

27:20.573 --> 27:22.439
[Kathleen] I could stay here
all day.

27:23.408 --> 27:24.875
[chuckles]

27:24.877 --> 27:26.877
[smooth music playing]

27:28.546 --> 27:30.547
[woman] Hey, buddy. Hi!

27:30.549 --> 27:32.082
His colors are so cool.

27:37.188 --> 27:40.658
- [Taryn] Oh, hello, little lady.
- [growls]

27:40.660 --> 27:43.560
Oh. So grumpy already?

27:43.562 --> 27:45.262
- Come here.
- [grunts]

27:45.264 --> 27:46.864
Yes, I know. Come here.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.932
Good lady.

27:48.934 --> 27:50.901
Aurora, our newest Amur tiger

27:50.903 --> 27:53.203
has been at Tiger Mountain
for about two months now.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.339
That's a good girl.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.942
Where are you going? Aurora.

27:59.811 --> 28:02.379
Come here.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.782
<i>It's been a while since
I've had to develop</i>

28:04.784 --> 28:08.118
<i>a whole new relationship
with a completely different tiger.</i>

28:08.120 --> 28:10.788
She's trying to learn me
and I'm trying to learn her.

28:10.790 --> 28:14.224
Hi. Are you coming back?
Maybe not? Come on.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.493
<i>I'm not really asking
very much of her right now</i>

28:16.495 --> 28:19.463
<i>other than her
to just tolerate me.</i>

28:19.465 --> 28:22.299
A lot of what it takes
to get her comfortable here

28:22.301 --> 28:25.903
is for her just to be
seeing us every day.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.604
Here you go.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.274
It's okay.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.409
It's okay to be grumpy about it.

28:33.311 --> 28:35.312
I know.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.147
I'm certainly grumpy
sometimes too.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.949
Here you go.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.751
Good girl.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.587
<i>Aurora seems to be
a talkative tiger...</i>

28:43.589 --> 28:45.456
[Aurora grunts]

28:45.458 --> 28:47.558
<i>that might sound
aggressive,</i>

28:47.560 --> 28:49.727
but it's not necessarily
aggression.

28:49.729 --> 28:52.129
It's just that she's chatty.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.397
[Aurora growls]

28:53.399 --> 28:54.765
Here you go.

28:56.334 --> 28:57.701
- All done.
- [growls]

28:57.703 --> 29:01.038
- Good girl.
- [grunts]

29:02.140 --> 29:03.240
It's time to go out.

29:07.812 --> 29:09.613
I'm just checking all the locks,

29:09.615 --> 29:11.782
making sure that the yard
is secure right now

29:11.784 --> 29:13.450
before we let Aurora out here.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.520
<i>I will be giving Aurora
access to the sand yard.</i>

29:16.522 --> 29:18.989
<i>The sand yard is an outdoor
holding yard</i>

29:18.991 --> 29:22.693
that is attached to our Tiger
Mountain holding building.

29:22.695 --> 29:25.529
<i>This will be her
first time that she's gotten</i>

29:25.531 --> 29:27.030
<i>to have some outdoor time.</i>

29:27.032 --> 29:29.433
<i>It took us a while
to introduce Aurora</i>

29:29.435 --> 29:30.968
<i>to the sand yard</i>

29:30.970 --> 29:32.703
<i>because we needed to make sure</i>

29:32.705 --> 29:35.005
<i>that she was comfortable
enough with me</i>

29:35.007 --> 29:37.975
to be willing to go back
into the building

29:37.977 --> 29:39.643
<i>because we want them
back in the building</i>

29:39.645 --> 29:41.545
<i>at the end of the day
for not only, you know,</i>

29:41.547 --> 29:43.847
<i>human safety,
but for her safety as well.</i>

29:43.849 --> 29:45.983
She'll probably just come out,
and roam around and explore

29:45.985 --> 29:47.351
which is what I want to see.

29:49.354 --> 29:50.888
[growls]

29:50.890 --> 29:52.890
Hi, little lady. Come on.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.358
[growls]

29:54.360 --> 29:56.760
Yes, I know. Come on.

29:59.164 --> 30:03.700
- Good girl.
- [growls]

30:03.702 --> 30:05.335
It's okay. Come on.

30:05.337 --> 30:06.703
That's a good lady.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.839
<i>I'll baby talk her a lot.</i>

30:08.841 --> 30:11.175
<i>It just helps her
to hear my voice.</i>

30:11.177 --> 30:13.177
The more she hears my voice,

30:13.179 --> 30:15.312
the more she's going
to get comfortable.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.548
Good girl. I know.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.616
- So scary.
- [growls]

30:19.618 --> 30:22.186
<i>She's actually doing fantastic.</i>

30:22.188 --> 30:24.054
<i>There was nothing really
that was tipping me off</i>

30:24.056 --> 30:26.089
that she was super nervous
by being out there.

30:27.058 --> 30:29.359
What a brave girl.

30:29.361 --> 30:33.030
<i>Once we've got her super
comfortable out in that sand yard,</i>

30:33.032 --> 30:35.299
<i>it would be fantastic to get
her into one of the exhibits</i>

30:35.301 --> 30:37.267
<i>that we have here
at Tiger Mountain.</i>

30:37.269 --> 30:38.368
Come here.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.536
<i>We've had to take things</i>

30:39.538 --> 30:40.871
<i>a little bit slower with her.</i>

30:40.873 --> 30:42.940
<i>She's a little bit more nervous</i>

30:42.942 --> 30:45.676
<i>than some of our tigers
in the past.</i>

30:45.678 --> 30:48.245
<i>We're here for the animals, so</i>

30:48.247 --> 30:51.548
if they require more patience,
more effort, more time,

30:51.550 --> 30:54.751
<i>we're going to do our best to make
their lives here as good as we can.</i>

30:54.753 --> 30:55.886
Come here.

30:55.888 --> 30:58.021
And we're just gonna
keep on inching forward.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.924
That's a good girl.
Oh, so good.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.366
He's so cute.

31:20.311 --> 31:23.513
So this is about
a pound of herring

31:23.515 --> 31:26.483
and I'm feeding this herring
to Sidney.

31:28.253 --> 31:29.853
Feed time.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.022
<i>Sidney, our new harbor seal
has been here</i>

31:32.024 --> 31:33.924
<i>for about six weeks now.</i>

31:33.926 --> 31:36.293
Hi!

31:36.295 --> 31:38.695
Hey, Sidney girl.

31:38.697 --> 31:41.231
<i>She has become comfortable,</i>

31:41.233 --> 31:42.499
<i>she's playful,</i>

31:42.501 --> 31:44.334
<i>she looks great,</i>

31:44.336 --> 31:47.938
<i>but she's not eating
her normal amount of food.</i>

31:47.940 --> 31:50.707
Okay, Sidney. You ready?

31:51.509 --> 31:52.643
Come on over.

31:54.345 --> 31:56.914
I've never met a seal that

31:56.916 --> 31:58.682
is not that into eating.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.284
Sid.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.521
<i>It's not concerning,</i>

32:04.523 --> 32:07.424
<i>because seals can go
weeks without eating.</i>

32:07.426 --> 32:09.993
<i>Food isn't always available
in the wild.</i>

32:09.995 --> 32:12.329
So they may eat a lot
and gain a lot of weight

32:12.331 --> 32:14.031
and then not eat
for a long time.

32:16.367 --> 32:17.601
That's a girl.

32:19.470 --> 32:22.005
<i>She came in with a lot
of extra weight on her.</i>

32:22.007 --> 32:24.074
<i>So she's not hungry.</i>

32:24.076 --> 32:26.109
<i>But when she's with
the other seals,</i>

32:26.111 --> 32:28.111
<i>she's not going
to have the option</i>

32:28.113 --> 32:30.614
<i>of playing with the fish
and eventually eating it,</i>

32:30.616 --> 32:33.283
<i>because there'll be
four other seals</i>

32:33.285 --> 32:37.220
<i>who'll be only too happy to
grab anything that she drops.</i>

32:38.356 --> 32:39.456
Get that fish.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.124
<i>The keepers in California</i>

32:41.126 --> 32:43.827
<i>were feeding her herring
and capelin.</i>

32:43.829 --> 32:45.262
Get that fish.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.830
<i>We're feeding her
the very same thing</i>

32:46.832 --> 32:48.799
<i>they did,
but she just wants to play.</i>

32:48.801 --> 32:50.233
She's pushing it around.

32:50.235 --> 32:53.203
So as soon as
she does that again,

32:53.205 --> 32:56.173
I'm going to be throwing
this toy in

32:56.175 --> 32:59.276
to tell her, "Yes,
that's the correct thing."

33:00.645 --> 33:02.646
One more time, pick it up.

33:02.648 --> 33:06.216
And... Good, that's what
I want her to do.

33:06.218 --> 33:10.420
Most animals learn to play
with a ball

33:10.422 --> 33:12.089
using fish as a reward.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.390
So it's the opposite.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.759
<i>Sidney's not food motivated</i>

33:15.761 --> 33:18.662
but she's very enrichment
motivated.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.797
Bring me that ball.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.468
What a smart seal.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.603
Who's the smartest seal?

33:28.873 --> 33:31.675
So now I'm going to
point to that fish again

33:31.677 --> 33:34.878
and my guess is she'll go
right down to it. Let me see.

33:36.114 --> 33:38.548
All right, Sid, get that fish.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.054
And she goes right down to it.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.825
Oop, did she just eat that?
She sure did.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.927
Nice job.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.130
<i>So the toy goes right in.</i>

33:53.132 --> 33:55.966
<i>As soon as she swallows it,
the ball goes in.</i>

33:55.968 --> 33:58.301
<i>So we're pairing
that relationship</i>

33:58.303 --> 34:01.805
<i>between swallowing the fish
and play.</i>

34:01.807 --> 34:03.373
Nice job.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.776
<i>Sidney is getting
better and better.</i>

34:05.778 --> 34:07.778
<i>We're going to continue
to work with Sidney,</i>

34:07.780 --> 34:10.180
<i>so that she'll eat
more and more.</i>

34:10.182 --> 34:13.150
<i>We hope that Sidney starts
to eat on a more regular basis,</i>

34:13.152 --> 34:15.552
so we can get her out
on to the seal exhibit

34:15.554 --> 34:17.421
to meet her new buddies.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.156
Nice job.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.258
I love those flippers.

34:22.627 --> 34:26.263
<i>[Hector] Sally-Anne has never
seen another bird before.</i>

34:26.265 --> 34:28.098
<i>[Chuck] She's just
looking around.</i>

34:28.100 --> 34:30.233
<i>Checking out the new neighbor.</i>

34:30.235 --> 34:34.037
<i>[Hector] It's very important
for them to socialize.</i>

34:34.039 --> 34:35.639
[bird calls]

34:46.284 --> 34:48.218
[indistinct chatter]

34:54.559 --> 34:56.393
[Chuck]
Grab her diet, too, Hector.

34:56.395 --> 34:59.496
<i>[Hector] Last week,
we moved Sally-Anne</i>

34:59.498 --> 35:03.033
<i>from brooder room
to off-exhibit holding.</i>

35:03.035 --> 35:05.335
[Chuck]
Here's where the food is.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.736
Looks good.

35:06.738 --> 35:09.673
<i>[Hector] She is
three months old.</i>

35:09.675 --> 35:12.409
<i>She's eating on her own,
she's flying,</i>

35:12.411 --> 35:13.743
very independent.

35:14.545 --> 35:16.980
Today, she's getting a neighbor.

35:16.982 --> 35:19.382
She's getting her brother.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.685
<i>At this age, birds-of-paradise</i>

35:21.687 --> 35:23.753
are usually in groups.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.690
<i>So it's very important
for them to socialize</i>

35:26.692 --> 35:29.359
<i>with their own species
and to learn about</i>

35:29.361 --> 35:32.028
<i>each other's behavior.</i>

35:32.030 --> 35:36.733
I'll go in first to the back
because I have the higher net.

35:36.735 --> 35:40.971
<i>[Hector] We will be moving
Cranberry, the male red bird-of-paradise.</i>

35:40.973 --> 35:42.806
[Chuck] There you are.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.075
<i>[Hector] We're putting him
next to the holding</i>

35:45.077 --> 35:47.210
<i>that we have Sally-Anne.</i>

35:47.212 --> 35:49.346
[bird squawking]

35:51.983 --> 35:54.751
<i>The male was raised by his mom</i>

35:54.753 --> 35:57.220
<i>because she only usually
raises one chick.</i>

35:57.222 --> 35:59.189
Okay, we good?

36:01.626 --> 36:03.326
<i>[Hector] I'm kind of scared
because Sally-Anne</i>

36:03.328 --> 36:05.729
<i>has never seen
a red bird-of-paradise.</i>

36:05.731 --> 36:08.331
So I don't know what
I'm really expecting.

36:11.602 --> 36:13.103
[Chuck] Are we ready
to let it out?

36:17.341 --> 36:19.242
Come on, you can do it.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.648
[Chuck] There she goes.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.082
She's just looking around.

36:26.084 --> 36:27.484
Checking out the new neighbor.

36:27.486 --> 36:29.286
[bird squawking]

36:31.989 --> 36:34.291
They don't seem bothered
by each other at all.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.394
Sally-Anne seems very calm.

36:37.396 --> 36:40.764
She's not really
bouncing around, anxious.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.768
[Hector] She's like,
"Meh, I'm done.

36:44.770 --> 36:47.704
Now's time to eat.
I've seen enough."

36:47.706 --> 36:49.272
- [Ken] He's watching her.
- [Chuck] Yeah.

36:49.274 --> 36:51.608
And he's coming down, too.
That's really good.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.878
Sally-Anne's presence in here
will help Cranberry

36:54.880 --> 36:56.646
adjusting to this new area.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.149
They help each other out.

36:59.151 --> 37:01.618
<i>[Ken] The best case
scenario in hand raising</i>

37:01.620 --> 37:04.955
<i>is to make the bird the
species it's supposed to be.</i>

37:04.957 --> 37:06.990
Because the goal really is to
have this bird

37:06.992 --> 37:08.892
part of a breeding population.

37:11.429 --> 37:12.529
So far, it's going really well.

37:12.563 --> 37:15.265
It's just going to take them
some time to, you know,

37:15.267 --> 37:17.634
really settle in
and learn where food is

37:17.636 --> 37:19.669
and all that good stuff.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.304
<i>Because red birds-of-paradise</i>

37:21.306 --> 37:23.273
<i>are near-threatened in the wild,</i>

37:23.275 --> 37:26.142
<i>it's really important that,
here at the Bronx Zoo,</i>

37:26.144 --> 37:28.979
we're able to keep a good eye
on the chicks that we have

37:28.981 --> 37:31.314
because each one
is really important.

37:31.316 --> 37:33.783
He's definitely
very interested in her.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.052
They're going to get along good.

37:36.054 --> 37:38.555
[birds squawking]

37:38.557 --> 37:40.457
[Martha] Sidney,
you ready, sweetie?

37:40.459 --> 37:43.693
<i>This little harbor seal is
going to go meet her buddies.</i>

37:43.695 --> 37:46.763
[Payden] It feels like the
first day of school. Who's that?

37:46.765 --> 37:49.532
[Lindsey] She's so cute.
I can't stand it.

38:06.183 --> 38:08.485
[Payden] I'll cut Cordie's
herring for you, John.

38:08.487 --> 38:11.921
That way you'll have
more pieces for her.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.858
<i>Today, we're bringing
our newest seal, Sidney</i>

38:14.860 --> 38:18.028
<i>out from our back
holding area on to exhibit</i>

38:18.030 --> 38:19.329
<i>with the rest of our seals.</i>

38:19.331 --> 38:20.764
- Okay, we ready?
- Okay.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.365
[Martha]
<i>This little harbor seal</i>

38:22.367 --> 38:24.968
<i>is going to go meet her buddies.</i>

38:24.970 --> 38:26.336
[Payden] I'm excited for her.

38:27.872 --> 38:30.173
It feels like
the first day of school.

38:35.413 --> 38:36.880
Coral!

38:37.548 --> 38:39.316
Hi!

38:39.318 --> 38:43.620
Little Murphy!

38:43.622 --> 38:47.991
<i>[Martha] So Sidney's about
to meet four other seals.</i>

38:47.993 --> 38:49.959
I think this is going to be
a lot for Sidney.

38:49.961 --> 38:53.563
<i>She's really bonded to people.</i>

38:53.565 --> 38:56.066
<i>Will she want to go out
and be with those seals</i>

38:56.068 --> 38:58.702
or is she gonna take a look
at them and turn around

38:58.704 --> 38:59.803
and come to me?

39:02.807 --> 39:04.574
What do you think?

39:05.109 --> 39:06.276
Look.

39:07.778 --> 39:09.779
[Payden] Hi, sweet girl.

39:10.915 --> 39:12.515
Who's that?

39:13.484 --> 39:15.585
Water, good.

39:21.826 --> 39:23.927
[Martha] There she goes.

39:23.929 --> 39:25.462
[Payden] Nice job, lady.

39:25.464 --> 39:28.465
- [device beeps]
- Sidney is on exhibit.

39:28.467 --> 39:31.134
Hi! You did it.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.536
That was brave.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.239
She's a little nervous.
Not bad.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.943
Will's, like, tailing her.

39:41.479 --> 39:43.613
But he's being...

39:43.615 --> 39:45.615
very polite about it.
[chuckles]

39:51.288 --> 39:54.090
It's a baby, Will.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.193
[Martha chuckles]
Oh, that's great.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.232
That looked fantastic.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.901
[Payden] What a good boy.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.871
Sidney did a breath exchange.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.272
Identifying each other.

40:10.775 --> 40:13.777
They're all
very interested in her

40:13.779 --> 40:15.812
and she's not fearful
at all of them.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.047
She's just kind of
breath exchanging back.

40:18.049 --> 40:20.850
So that's actually exactly
what we want to see.

40:26.457 --> 40:32.829
It's just so exciting. She looks
great. She's using the whole exhibit.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.631
<i>There's nothing more
rewarding to them</i>

40:34.633 --> 40:37.200
<i>than being able to be
out with other animals.</i>

40:37.202 --> 40:39.669
Look at you. Look at you!

40:39.671 --> 40:41.771
Hi!

40:41.773 --> 40:44.541
[Martha] <i>I think this is
going to be great for Sidney.</i>

40:44.543 --> 40:48.178
<i>Just the thought that an animal
could be hours from death...</i>

40:48.180 --> 40:50.013
- [seal barks]
- [woman] I know.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.414
and be rescued

40:51.416 --> 40:54.184
<i>and affect conservation herself</i>

40:54.186 --> 40:55.518
<i>as people come and see her.</i>

40:55.520 --> 40:57.520
That's special.
That's everything.

40:57.522 --> 41:00.690
Hey, cupcake.
[chuckles]

41:00.692 --> 41:02.725
<i>[Jim] I think a lot of people
would be surprised to learn</i>

41:02.727 --> 41:04.494
<i>how many animals are transferred</i>

41:04.496 --> 41:06.663
between zoos and aquariums
around the country.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.998
[tiger growling]

41:09.000 --> 41:11.334
<i>And animals move around for
a lot of different reasons.</i>

41:11.336 --> 41:13.269
<i>Sometimes it's for
breeding purposes,</i>

41:13.271 --> 41:14.971
sometimes they are
rescue animals,

41:14.973 --> 41:17.207
and sometimes it's
just for exhibit purposes.

41:17.209 --> 41:18.341
[mews]

41:18.343 --> 41:20.009
<i>Despite our best efforts,
there's always</i>

41:20.011 --> 41:22.645
<i>a little stress involved
when you move an animal.</i>

41:22.647 --> 41:24.814
<i>And, of course, all these
animals are individual,</i>

41:24.816 --> 41:27.851
<i>with their own personalities,
with their own likes and dislikes.</i>

41:27.853 --> 41:29.853
<i>So whenever we get
a new animal in here,</i>

41:29.855 --> 41:32.455
<i>we do whatever we can to
meet their individual needs</i>

41:32.457 --> 41:34.023
<i>and make them comfortable.</i>

41:34.025 --> 41:35.091
Good girl.

41:37.428 --> 41:39.195
<i>[Martha] I'm glad that
she gets to</i>

41:39.197 --> 41:41.331
<i>have her little family now.</i>
