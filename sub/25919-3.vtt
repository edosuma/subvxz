All right. That was great...

01:05.190 --> 01:06.107
for practice.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.276
But when we do it for real,
more enthusiasm.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.278
Remember, this is our one chance

01:10.361 --> 01:12.405
to become an official chapter
of the Frontier Fillies,

01:12.489 --> 01:13.531
with all that means.

01:13.615 --> 01:18.286
Official badges and newsletters
and jamborees with all kinds of jams.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.080
And jellies? You bet.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.665
Musical skit on poison ivy? Check.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.251
Snake skins from Punta Libre? Check.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.378
Pictures of the Kasprzak cave paintings?

01:27.462 --> 01:28.838
Check.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.215
Okay. I think we're ready.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.802
Let's head over to the depot and dazzle
our way into the Frontier Fillies.

01:33.885 --> 01:37.097
Now? Mrs. Hungerford's train
doesn't get in until three.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.515
We'd be four hours early.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.060
Our herd leader will only be in Miradero
for one hour between trains.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.436
We can't risk missing her.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.105
Besides,
a Frontier Filly is always punctual.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.942
-That's us.
-Abigail, you need to relax.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.569
You worked really hard on this.
She's gonna love it.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.739
I hope so. I can't keep making
my own activity badges.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.826
-I've already gone through four thimbles.
-Don't worry, Abigail.

01:57.909 --> 02:01.204
By tonight, we'll be the official
Frontier Fillies Miradero Herd.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.247
Promise?

02:02.330 --> 02:04.749
- Promise.
- What are we promising?

02:04.833 --> 02:07.752
Is it a blood oath?
'Cause I'm full of blood.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.878
What do you want, Snips?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.131
To play with you.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.215
We're busy.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.342
But you've been 'noring me forever.

02:14.425 --> 02:17.345
Last week you said
we could play this week,

02:17.428 --> 02:19.764
and yesterday you said today.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.142
Well, today is today.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.063
Neat. A praying mantis.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.106
No touching!

02:28.189 --> 02:31.276
Fine. Let's play freeze tag.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.362
That's like regular tag, but freezier.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.322
- No.
- Just go away.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.366
But you said you'd play with me.

02:38.449 --> 02:40.034
I got rights.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.202
-Duck...
-Hey!

02:41.286 --> 02:42.287
-duck...
-Stop!

02:42.370 --> 02:43.496
- duck...
- Snips!

02:43.580 --> 02:44.581
goose!

02:44.664 --> 02:46.040
Make way for Señor Carrots!

02:46.124 --> 02:47.584
Snips, watch out!

02:50.211 --> 02:51.629
No!

02:53.464 --> 02:54.841
Oops!

02:55.800 --> 02:57.010
Get him!

02:57.093 --> 02:58.553
Snips!

03:00.972 --> 03:04.809
Snips! We told you to stop.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.686
Why don't you ever listen?

03:08.605 --> 03:11.024
Figures.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.658
It's going to be okay, Abigail.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.036
Snips ruins everything--

03:23.119 --> 03:25.788
Boomerang's inauguration,
the rhubarb maze,

03:25.872 --> 03:27.206
even Iguana Awareness Day.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.335
Now he's ruining our only chance
to become official Fillies.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.838
Maybe we can catch Mrs. Hungerford
next time she's in town?

03:33.922 --> 03:36.007
Who knows when that'll be?

03:36.090 --> 03:38.051
It's been fun pretending
to be Frontier Fillies,

03:38.134 --> 03:40.178
but I wanna be the real thing.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.057
So be it. Fillies don't quit, right?

03:44.140 --> 03:47.435
Right. That's page ten of the handbook.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.394
Okay, then.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.854
We still have four hours

03:49.938 --> 03:51.856
before we're supposed
to meet Mrs. Hungerford.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.316
We just need a plan.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.068
You're right, Lucky.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.653
A Frontier Filly always has a plan,

03:56.736 --> 03:59.072
and our new plan is
to make a new presentation,

03:59.155 --> 04:01.658
wow Mrs. Hungerford,
become official Fillies,

04:01.741 --> 04:05.286
throw a celebratory sleepover,
and earn the Pillow Party Panache badge.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.329
Then let's go!

04:13.127 --> 04:14.504
Good news, Lucky.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.464
We found lavender, sage and peppermint.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.094
We found lavender and sage.

04:21.177 --> 04:24.097
Great. Now we just need
a real showstopping animal

04:24.180 --> 04:27.475
for our Frontier Flora
and Fauna Extravaganza.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.477
It may not be as good as our last project,

04:29.560 --> 04:32.272
but it'll be good enough
to earn us a herd. I know it.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.734
Whoa, Chica Linda, calm down.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.696
Why are you so jumpy, girl?

04:39.779 --> 04:41.990
It doesn't look
like there's a storm coming.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.245
I spoke too soon.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.496
Hello, ladies.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.081
Fancy seeing you here.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.874
You followed us here.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.711
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.505
But now that I did, let's play!

04:57.588 --> 04:59.382
Everybody chase me!

04:59.465 --> 05:02.302
Why do we even try?
Snips is just gonna ruin this, too.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.511
Don't worry, Abigail.

05:03.594 --> 05:06.514
You handle the presentation,
and I'll handle Snips, okay?

05:06.597 --> 05:10.101
First, you promised to play with me
when your presentation was done.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.145
And then you said, "It's ruined!"

05:12.228 --> 05:13.938
"Ruined" equals "done."

05:14.022 --> 05:15.523
Even I know that.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.900
So now you have to play with me.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.070
Snips, final warning. Go away.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.156
You can't tell me what to do.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.950
Only Señor Carrots can do that.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.037
I love playing.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.705
Let's play all day. Ha ha!

05:30.788 --> 05:32.957
You're right.
We can't tell you what to do.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.753
But we don't have to talk to you, either.
The silent treatment starts now.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.337
Says who?

05:38.421 --> 05:39.756
-Hmm.
-Come on!

05:39.839 --> 05:41.299
-Hmm.
-I'm right here!

05:41.382 --> 05:42.258
You hear anything?

05:42.341 --> 05:43.760
- You gotta talk to me!
- I don't hear anything...

05:43.843 --> 05:46.137
- not a sound.
- Hey!

05:46.220 --> 05:47.597
What are we thinking for a showstopper?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.098
- Over here!
- What about a tarantula?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.433
-Talk to me!
-Those are always impressive.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.517
Pay attention to me!

05:51.601 --> 05:53.269
Impressively dangerous.

05:53.352 --> 05:57.356
Hey! If you're looking for a death spider,
I know where one is.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.902
I can get it for you
if you just talk to me.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.362
They're not poisonous,
just creepy-looking.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.364
-Tarantula's got my vote.
-Come on!

06:05.448 --> 06:07.450
Please talk to me again.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.993
I'll stop, I promise.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.788
I can help. Please, please, please!

06:14.415 --> 06:16.209
Fine!

06:16.292 --> 06:18.002
Go ahead and ignore me.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.004
Who needs you mean girls?

06:20.088 --> 06:23.216
I'm gonna go play somewhere else
with Señor Carrots,

06:23.299 --> 06:26.803
who actually plays with me
when he says he will.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.930
Come on, Señor Carrots.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.235
Nice thinking, Lucky.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.153
I can't believe that actually worked.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.614
Why didn't I think of that six years ago?

06:46.697 --> 06:50.118
Okay, one pest down.
Now we have a spider to catch.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.167
Where are you, Mr. Tarantula?

06:59.502 --> 07:02.630
Well, Mr. Tarantula better hurry
if we want to make it to the depot

07:02.713 --> 07:04.048
before the four o'clock train.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.467
Oh, my gosh, look!

07:06.551 --> 07:08.177
That's Spirit's herd.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.847
Where are they going?

07:17.520 --> 07:19.397
Um, what is that?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.065
A dust storm!

07:21.149 --> 07:24.068
-What do we do?
-I know. Read.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.864
Aha! "Dust storms. They produce
blinding conditions and dust devils."

07:27.947 --> 07:29.615
They're like tornadoes with sand!

07:29.699 --> 07:31.534
We should go back, now.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.246
Wait. We have to get Snips first.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.665
-Where could he be?
-Maybe he went home?

07:37.748 --> 07:40.001
No, I bet he went to his pouting shack.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.671
It's a shack where he pouts.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.965
I thought that was
pretty self-explanatory.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.301
Okay, new plan--

07:48.384 --> 07:51.679
get Snips, go home, fix the presentation,
become official Fillies,

07:51.762 --> 07:54.098
petition for the creation
of a Sibling Survival badge,

07:54.182 --> 07:55.975
collect Sibling Survival badge.

07:59.979 --> 08:03.316
We should start our own town
with just us in it.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.777
No one would ever ignore us in Snipsadero.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.699
Oh, no.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.076
He's not crying
because of what I said, right?

08:15.411 --> 08:17.872
Yeah, it's probably all the dust.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.707
Snips, I'm really sorry.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.126
-But we have to go.
-There's a storm coming.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.295
So now you want to talk to me?

08:24.378 --> 08:26.797
No, thanks.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.049
Snips!

08:28.132 --> 08:29.592
We don't have time for this.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.803
Snips, I said I was sorry. Come out.

08:32.886 --> 08:33.971
This isn't a game.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.765
But it could be.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.143
Olly-olly oxen free!

08:39.227 --> 08:40.937
Whoo!

08:41.020 --> 08:44.232
If I'm oxen-free, then you're it.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.068
Hey, did you know there's a storm?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.451
Snips, come on.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.119
Snips!

08:57.203 --> 08:58.746
We have to go.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.707
There's no time. Get to the shack.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.377
Pru? Abigail? Snips?

09:04.460 --> 09:06.546
- I'm okay.
- Me too.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.548
Where's Snips? Snips!

09:08.631 --> 09:09.840
- Ouch!
- Hey!

09:09.924 --> 09:11.759
I found him.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.970
No way! I found you!

09:14.053 --> 09:15.888
I think I found Lucky.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.307
Ow! Nope, just a cactus.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.480
I found the shack.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.898
We should go that way.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.985
-No, this way.
-What makes you the direction expert?

09:29.068 --> 09:29.986
Everyone!

09:30.069 --> 09:31.195
Follow my voice.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.990
We're trying, but you're not
where you ought to be.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.992
And Pru's no help.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.829
New game, everyone. Marco!

09:40.413 --> 09:42.206
-Polo!
-Polo!

09:42.290 --> 09:43.416
Marco!

09:43.499 --> 09:45.793
- Polo!
- Whoa.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.463
- Marco!
- Polo!

09:50.089 --> 09:52.800
Quick, inside!

09:56.304 --> 09:58.681
The wind is too strong!

10:05.896 --> 10:08.232
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

10:14.071 --> 10:16.073
Snips!

10:16.157 --> 10:18.242
Are you okay?

10:18.326 --> 10:19.160
Get off.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.249
Look what you girls have done.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.753
Your dumb presentation got us caught
in a dust storm.

10:28.836 --> 10:32.840
We were only out here because you wrecked
our presentation in the first place.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.259
This is no time to point fingers.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.802
Whoa! Look out!

10:38.888 --> 10:39.722
It's okay, girl.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.223
Okay, new, new plan.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.060
Survive storm, go home,
meet Mrs. Hungerford,

10:44.143 --> 10:47.480
become Fillies, reinforce
the pouting shack for future emergencies,

10:47.563 --> 10:49.065
get our Wondrous Woodworking badge.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.819
It's going to be okay, Snips.
You don't need to be scared.

10:53.903 --> 10:58.074
I'm not scared.
I just like how Señor Carrots smells.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.662
The door's not gonna hold.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.705
Everybody, grab on.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.082
- Not me.
- Snips!

11:06.165 --> 11:09.960
Not because it's scary.
I'm just not doing anything you tell me.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.254
Will you stop being such a pest and help?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.298
Snips, don't you want to win tug-of-war?

11:14.382 --> 11:17.510
Huh? I like war and winning.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.886
Then grab my waist.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.346
It's kids versus wind.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.556
And the wind is way ahead.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.934
Let's beat the wind!

11:30.981 --> 11:33.359
We need more manpower.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.570
- Señor Carrots, get in here!
- Snips!

11:44.328 --> 11:45.162
Aah!

11:48.124 --> 11:50.918
Spirit! Here!

12:09.228 --> 12:12.022
You found me. Thank you.

12:12.648 --> 12:15.151
Come on, we've gotta get back.

12:22.825 --> 12:27.538
Oh, no. Pru! Abigail!

12:28.539 --> 12:30.166
Snips.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.667
Lucky!

12:32.460 --> 12:33.669
Over here!

12:36.672 --> 12:39.300
What happened here?

12:43.053 --> 12:46.640
Turns out the shack is better
for pouting than it is for sheltering.

12:46.724 --> 12:50.394
Hey, Lucky, about you getting
sucked out the door...

12:53.773 --> 12:55.566
You probably should've held on tighter.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.569
What do we do now?

12:59.028 --> 13:01.572
-Go home.
-No. The storm's not over yet.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.617
Kasprzak Cave's not far.
We should ride it out there.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.410
Great. New, new, new plan.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.996
Ride to Kasprzak Cave,
hide out, catch a tarantula,

13:09.079 --> 13:10.789
go home, become official Fillies,

13:10.873 --> 13:13.209
find the tarantula a good home far
from our homes,

13:13.292 --> 13:15.044
earn our Arachnid Awareness badge.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.005
Good new, new, new plan.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.800
Snips, you need to stick really close
to us, okay?

13:21.884 --> 13:25.012
Why? So you can use me for spider bait?

13:25.095 --> 13:26.764
I'm going home.

13:27.890 --> 13:28.807
Ugh.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.227
Hey, Snips.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.896
Is Señor Carrots any good at Simon Says?

13:34.563 --> 13:38.442
Are you kidding me?
He's a decorated world champion.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.528
Then Simon says to follow me.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.254
We should be coming up on the cave soon!

13:58.337 --> 13:59.171
Huh?

13:59.255 --> 14:01.715
She wants you to jump in a lagoon!

14:01.799 --> 14:04.051
Which sounds much more fun
than what we're doing.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.302
Good plan, Pru.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.265
-Oof!
-The supplies!

14:09.348 --> 14:10.975
No, no, no, no, no!

14:12.643 --> 14:13.686
Oh.

14:13.769 --> 14:14.812
Aah!

14:14.895 --> 14:16.855
Is that a dust devil?

14:18.941 --> 14:21.360
It's three dust devils!

14:21.443 --> 14:24.238
Well, what harm can they do over there?

14:28.492 --> 14:31.161
Duck!

14:31.745 --> 14:32.621
Snips!

14:32.705 --> 14:34.415
- Snips! Snips!
- Snips!

14:37.585 --> 14:38.878
Simon says run!

14:39.461 --> 14:41.797
Come on, Señor Carrots.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.716
Simon says let's go!

14:49.430 --> 14:50.514
Simon says left!

14:55.185 --> 14:56.854
Simon says right!

15:03.819 --> 15:05.529
Simon says hit the deck!

15:07.114 --> 15:08.115
Whoa!

15:08.198 --> 15:10.284
Simon says stay down.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.374
There! Kasprzak Cave!

15:18.000 --> 15:19.126
Run!

15:33.223 --> 15:35.142
Where's Snips?

15:35.225 --> 15:37.061
Hey, pals!

15:37.561 --> 15:39.146
Pals!

15:41.649 --> 15:43.901
Come on, boy.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.780
Snips, stay close.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.740
We need to stick together.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.367
Snips?

15:52.284 --> 15:54.870
Oh, my gosh! Snips! Snips!

15:55.663 --> 15:56.580
Snips!

15:56.664 --> 15:57.957
-Abigail, no!
-Snips!

15:58.040 --> 16:00.376
You can't. It's too dangerous.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.169
Snips!

16:15.307 --> 16:17.142
Snips, what are you doing?

16:17.893 --> 16:19.645
Simon didn't say "run."

16:19.728 --> 16:23.440
Then Simon says run!

16:27.236 --> 16:28.570
Let's get out of here.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.823
Simon says, okay?

16:38.497 --> 16:41.667
Whoa! Look out!

16:41.750 --> 16:43.002
Oh, no.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.928
What do we do?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.222
I'm-- I'm not sure.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.230
Snips, come on.

17:03.313 --> 17:06.233
Spirit is too heavy to be lifted.
Now hold on tight.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.862
I trust you, horse.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.017
- Oh.
- Oh!

17:41.769 --> 17:43.353
Whoa.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.859
Help me, Lucky!

17:54.198 --> 17:55.866
Hang on, Snips!

18:15.594 --> 18:17.513
Snips, are you okay?

18:17.596 --> 18:19.807
Uh-huh.

18:20.599 --> 18:21.642
Snips!

18:21.725 --> 18:23.102
Lucky!

18:29.108 --> 18:32.194
-Did you see that?
-They were in it.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.949
Thank you for saving my life...

18:37.032 --> 18:38.992
even though you hate me.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.371
Oh.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.748
I don't hate you, Snips.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.875
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings before.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.879
-We all are.
-Yeah.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.423
Okay.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.554
Also, um...

18:58.637 --> 19:00.639
I'm sorry for smashing your presentation.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.598
There.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.641
The presentation!

19:02.724 --> 19:05.144
The train leaves in 15 minutes.
What are we gonna do?

19:05.227 --> 19:08.355
Something! We will do something.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.773
I just need a new plan.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.359
And the new plan is...

19:12.442 --> 19:13.819
think of a plan on the way.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.493
Snips!

19:21.577 --> 19:22.870
Come on.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.081
Yeah!

19:26.165 --> 19:29.585
Fast as a dust devil, Señor Carrots!

19:39.094 --> 19:40.179
There she is.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.265
Wait!

19:44.266 --> 19:46.018
Not you. Sorry, sir.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.563
Can I help you?

19:49.646 --> 19:52.024
I'm Lucky. This is Pru and Abigail.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.609
And I'm Snips.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.736
We were supposed to meet you here earlier.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.821
Not Snips. He's new.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.156
Ah, yes.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.533
I was expecting you girls an hour ago...

20:01.617 --> 20:02.618
with lunch.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.954
I believe you mentioned something
about a homemade pie.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.418
No? No pie?

20:11.501 --> 20:12.628
Sorry.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.088
I'm sorry, too, girls,
but you're a little too late.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.132
My train is leaving.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.845
Missus! You can't leave.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.848
I nearly died getting these girls here
on time.

20:24.932 --> 20:29.645
You got to hear Abigail out.
Go on, Abigail. Tell her your plan.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.563
Uh, I, uh...

20:31.647 --> 20:33.523
The plan...

20:33.607 --> 20:35.651
The plan is...

20:35.734 --> 20:38.946
the... the plan is... uh...

20:40.948 --> 20:42.241
Abigail.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.617
Abigail.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.661
Simon says speak.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.037
Oh, I've got nothing!

20:47.621 --> 20:49.206
No plan and no pie

20:49.289 --> 20:50.457
and no presentation!

20:50.540 --> 20:52.709
I had all those things.
My brother ruined them.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.754
We were going to make a new presentation,
but a dust storm hit.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.547
Then the pouting shack blew away

20:57.631 --> 21:00.217
and sucked Lucky out the door,
so we had to use the horses as windbreaks.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.928
And then the dust devils
ate our backup presentation,

21:03.011 --> 21:05.055
and we had to find shelter in a cave.

21:05.138 --> 21:07.224
And we don't even have a tarantula
for you!

21:07.307 --> 21:11.478
So, in conclusion, I guess
we don't deserve to be official Fillies

21:11.561 --> 21:13.272
or go to the Jamboree

21:13.355 --> 21:14.940
or even eat jam.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.567
Is this all true?

21:17.651 --> 21:19.027
Yes.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.821
See?

21:20.904 --> 21:23.115
And you ruined the presentation?

21:23.198 --> 21:25.075
I was awful.

21:25.158 --> 21:28.704
- Well, then, I hope you thank him.
- Huh?

21:28.787 --> 21:31.707
Yeah, thank me. About time!

21:32.124 --> 21:33.083
For what?

21:33.166 --> 21:36.712
I've seen more Frontier Fillies
presentations than I can count,

21:36.795 --> 21:41.425
and they're always the same--
dioramas, posters, terrible songs.

21:41.508 --> 21:45.512
But you actually used what you learned
to keep yourselves safe in the wild,

21:45.595 --> 21:47.764
and that's what the Fillies are all about.

21:47.848 --> 21:48.682
Really?

21:48.765 --> 21:51.310
But all my plans failed.

21:51.393 --> 21:55.522
Plans are well and good, Abigail,
but a Frontier Filly thinks on her feet,

21:55.605 --> 21:58.942
and from the looks of things,
you girls did a lot of thinking.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.819
They did all the thinking.

22:00.902 --> 22:04.990
Then I'm happy to be the one
who grants Miradero an official herd.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.075
Whoo-hoo!

22:08.243 --> 22:10.329
Here you go.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.456
Well deserved, young lady.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.549
Hey! No fair.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.551
Where's mine?

22:25.093 --> 22:25.969
Right here!

22:26.636 --> 22:28.221
Wow.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.600
Aww.

22:34.102 --> 22:35.771
What game do you want to play?

22:35.854 --> 22:36.980
- Ooh, let's--
- Shh.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.357
It's Señor Carrots' turn to pick.
