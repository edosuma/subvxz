00:10.911 --> 00:11.979
Everett, are you all right?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.482
Just here to talk.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.456
It's right outside the house.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.193
- These are silver.
- You made these?

00:25.193 --> 00:26.894
To kill werewolves?
- Yes.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.396

Do you know what that means?

00:54.388 --> 00:57.258
Everything that can burn
is on fire.

00:57.258 --> 01:01.962
So if you know anything,
you need to tell me right now.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.498
Austin, tell her.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.800
Tell her why you can't sleep,

01:06.800 --> 01:09.170
why you can't even
close your eyes.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.208
Austin, do you know something
about who set the fire?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.677
It's not that.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.812
This isn't about the fire?

01:18.812 --> 01:21.349
Tell her.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.517
I saw something.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.322
Okay.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.458
What did you see?

01:30.458 --> 01:32.160
On the highway.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.330
You saw someone
on the highway?

01:40.368 --> 01:42.336
Not someone?

01:48.041 --> 01:50.778
Whatever he saw,
it killed people,

01:50.778 --> 01:52.513
and now he can't get it
out of his head.

01:52.513 --> 01:56.016
You people need
to find this thing.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.919
Find what thing?

01:58.919 --> 02:01.889
Austin.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.657
There's something--

02:04.825 --> 02:05.793
Just tell her
what you told me.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.695
She's not gonna believe me.

02:07.695 --> 02:11.899
Actually, I think I know
what you're talking about.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.002
It was big, right?

02:18.071 --> 02:19.407
Yeah.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.009
Dark fur, black?

02:22.009 --> 02:23.711
Yeah.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.246
About 7 feet tall?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.219
Yeah.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.386
Yes.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.188
Fangs and claws?

02:37.057 --> 02:40.761
Was it an animal,

02:40.761 --> 02:42.263
kind of like one of those?

02:57.945 --> 03:00.047
Austin, I don't want you
to think those pictures

03:00.047 --> 03:02.416
are hanging there
as some kind of joke,

03:02.416 --> 03:04.552
like we're mocking
the witnesses.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.887
I have them there to remind me

03:06.887 --> 03:08.956
how powerful and confusing

03:08.956 --> 03:12.059
a traumatic event
like this can be.

03:12.059 --> 03:15.329
I have no doubt
that a 280-pound ram

03:15.329 --> 03:19.300
charging right at you
is completely terrifying.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.569
It wasn't a ram.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.070
But it wasn't
a 7-foot monster

03:23.070 --> 03:26.640
with fangs and claws
either, right?

03:26.640 --> 03:29.643
Then what killed Connor?

03:29.643 --> 03:32.012
We're still
looking for Connor.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.714
What makes you think
someone killed him?

03:33.714 --> 03:36.083
Not someone.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.221
Austin,
do you know where he is?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.894
No.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.997
Maybe you should ask
the fucking ram.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.766
Austin.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.474
He's been out there too long.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.808
It's been less
than ten minutes.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.109
He's got the gun.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.878
I'm going out.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.349
Couldn't find anything
out there.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.650
Are you sure about the cop?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.486
Yeah, one second
the guy's standing there,

05:18.486 --> 05:19.853
slamming my head into the wall,

05:19.853 --> 05:21.489
and the next he's gone.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.790
Gone meaning dead.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.825
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.061
Whatever happened to him,
we're gonna find out.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.730
None of you here have seen

05:29.730 --> 05:31.965
anything like that before,
like, ever?

05:31.965 --> 05:34.134
I told you,
this is all new to us too.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.769
So we're safe?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.771
It's not gonna kill us?

05:37.771 --> 05:39.006
Not if we're part
of its pack.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.374
It's protecting us.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.242
From what, a shitty cop?

05:42.242 --> 05:44.311
How do we know it's not
still coming after us?

05:44.311 --> 05:46.179
We don't.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.450
So we're gonna have
to figure some things out,

05:49.450 --> 05:51.552
how to keep you safe,

05:51.552 --> 05:53.353
how to protect ourselves.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.528
Yes, it's silver,

06:00.528 --> 06:03.597
which actually doesn't make
for a very good bullet.

06:03.597 --> 06:07.801
Metal is not as dense as lead,
which affects the accuracy.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.937
You made it yourself?

06:09.937 --> 06:12.172
I made about 50 of them.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.909
Bought the silver bullion online,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.277
learned how to cast
the bullets.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.346
We're never really
gonna use them, right?

06:19.346 --> 06:20.714
No.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.884
Well, possibly.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.456
You have to remember,
when I found the two of you,

06:28.456 --> 06:31.058
you were both cubs.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.160
Wait, they were what?

06:33.160 --> 06:34.662
Wolf cubs.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.597
That's how I found them.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.766
I brought them home
thinking I would drop them off

06:38.766 --> 06:41.368
at a wolf sanctuary
and that would be it.

06:44.037 --> 06:47.107
So how'd they get like that?

06:47.107 --> 06:50.578
To be honest,
I don't know how it happened.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.146
So you made silver bullets

06:53.146 --> 06:56.316
just in case we turned
back into wolves?

07:00.153 --> 07:03.791
I had no fucking idea
what you were gonna turn into.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.626
I didn't know who
or what you were,

07:05.626 --> 07:07.427
and I was alone.

07:09.196 --> 07:12.032
Did I eventually
find out the truth,

07:12.032 --> 07:13.967
that the two of you are
every bit as human

07:13.967 --> 07:15.335
as me and anyone else?

07:15.335 --> 07:17.437
Yeah, of course.

07:19.707 --> 07:20.774
But you kept the bullets.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.643
And the gun--loaded.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.545
Now you know why.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.117
Our real father.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.819
I'm sorry, this is probably
not even something

07:31.819 --> 07:33.186
you guys are even
thinking about right now,

07:33.186 --> 07:35.322
but are we gonna
turn into that,

07:35.322 --> 07:38.626
that thing that's
your real father?

07:38.626 --> 07:39.760
That's not my father.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.961
Then what is it?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.696
It's a killer.

07:46.199 --> 07:50.337
I don't know if silver bullets
actually kill werewolves,

07:50.337 --> 07:54.007
but I have a feeling
we're gonna find out.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.265
<i>I'm taking you home.</i>

09:58.265 --> 10:00.067
<i>Tomorrow you're going
to school,</i>

10:00.067 --> 10:01.869
<i>just like everyone else.</i>

10:01.869 --> 10:03.136
<i>I can't do it.</i>

10:03.136 --> 10:04.537
<i>I can't go back
to school tomorrow.</i>

10:06.073 --> 10:07.507
If they're
reopening the schools,

10:07.507 --> 10:09.076
you need to be there.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.411
You have to act
like everything's normal,

10:11.411 --> 10:12.713
both of you.

10:12.713 --> 10:16.249
Normal, for real?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.951
And no more answering calls

10:17.951 --> 10:20.353
from numbers
you don't recognize.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.956
Then why is he helping us?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.625
I'm not so sure he is.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.181
I know you don't
have a phone,

10:48.181 --> 10:53.520
but if you're near one
and you need something,

10:53.520 --> 10:55.255
call me.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.725
Permanent marker?

10:57.725 --> 11:00.660
I thought you'd probably
try and wash it off.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.662
I'm still going to.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.731
I know.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.752
It's not safe.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.253
He said to stay here.

11:26.253 --> 11:29.056
He also has a rifle
with silver bullets to kill us.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.791
I'm going out.

but they're not
running the buses.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.822
Someone's gotta drive him.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.624
Well, we grounded him.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.760
He ran off to Lord knows where

13:47.760 --> 13:49.196
and came back
in the middle of the night.

13:49.196 --> 13:52.099
I think he's
pretty resourceful.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.267
You hate him so much,
you can't drive him to school?

13:54.267 --> 13:56.569

14:06.980 --> 14:08.548
You didn't love
the preteen either,

14:08.548 --> 14:10.250
or the child.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.587
He screamed for four months--

14:14.587 --> 14:15.923
not crying, screaming.

14:15.923 --> 14:19.459
- He had colic.
- I know.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.462
But all the panic attacks,
all the psychologists,

14:22.462 --> 14:26.599
all the prescriptions

14:46.753 --> 14:49.422
you take shit
for your anxiety, right?

14:49.422 --> 14:50.623
Yeah.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.192
What do you take?

14:52.192 --> 14:54.962
What, do you mean,
like, as needed, or...

14:54.962 --> 14:56.596
What's the difference?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.365
Well,
I take an SSRI every day

14:58.365 --> 15:00.867
for generalized anxiety,
but if it's really bad--

15:00.867 --> 15:02.802
What do you take
to get sleep?

15:02.802 --> 15:04.271
A sleeping pill.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.572
That's totally different though.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.639
You have any?

15:06.639 --> 15:07.874
You're not supposed to take

15:07.874 --> 15:09.042
a sleeping pill for anxiety.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.677
Everett, just please tell me

15:10.677 --> 15:13.080
if you've got anything that'll
help me get some fucking sleep.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.930
Dude.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.499
Yeah, I can give you some.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.800
Okay.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.002
Fuck yes.
You got it now?

15:35.002 --> 15:36.436
Look, I'm gonna
give you something,

15:36.436 --> 15:40.207
but I need you to do
something for me first.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.441
What?

15:41.441 --> 15:42.742
Tell me what you saw
on the highway.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.314
Tell me what you really saw.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.584
All right, settle down.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.988
Since Mrs. Ramirez
is currently sifting

15:54.988 --> 15:56.956
through the ashes
of her duplex,

15:56.956 --> 15:59.792
she's asked me to give you all

15:59.792 --> 16:01.228
the test you didn't take
on Friday.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.795
What the hell?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.364
Nobody told us we were
taking the test.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.765
I didn't study.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.467
You studied when you knew
it was on Friday, right?

16:07.467 --> 16:10.037
Oh, you mean before we all
practically burned to death?

16:12.139 --> 16:13.773
Anyone know who sits here?

16:16.376 --> 16:17.877
Connor.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.247
It's Connor Ryan's desk.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.682
Right.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.992
She's not telling us
how she knows.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.794
- So it was just a theory?
- No.

16:34.794 --> 16:38.065
Ramsey says the arsonist is
definitely one of the kids.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.832
She's gotta have
some kind of evidence.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.168
You're on the task force,

16:41.168 --> 16:42.602
and she's not telling you
this stuff?

16:42.602 --> 16:44.437
I'm just an advisor.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.309
Here.

16:52.712 --> 16:53.913
Ramsey's wrong.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.448
The arsonist isn't a kid.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.951
If it's anyone,
it's this guy on the phone,

16:58.951 --> 17:00.887
the one calling Blake
and Everett.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.724
The one who seems
to know what we know?

17:08.428 --> 17:11.164
Try to remember Harlan
and Luna still don't know

17:11.164 --> 17:12.699
that you know what you know.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.368
This might be a good time
to tell them,

17:15.368 --> 17:17.604
especially since I've got
my own box of silver bullets.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.372
I'll tell them
when they're less pissed off.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.109
You're still the backup plan
if something happens to me.

17:22.109 --> 17:24.177
Okay, so as your backup plan,

17:24.177 --> 17:26.379
I'm saying
don't talk to Ramsey.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.880
I looked her up.
She's good.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.682
She catches everybody.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.952
I wouldn't put Harlan and Luna
in her crosshairs.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.287
Let her look for the arsonist.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.923
You are looking
for their father.

17:36.923 --> 17:40.427
That's the problem.

17:40.427 --> 17:43.430
I think the arsonist is
looking for him too.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.835
When we were in the woods
the other night,

17:48.835 --> 17:51.204
when we first met
Blake and Everett,

17:51.204 --> 17:54.241
do remember how we got there?

17:54.241 --> 17:58.111
We ran
after we heard the howl.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.580
I don't remember running,
do you?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.815
Kind of, I don't know.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.083
Why?

18:04.083 --> 18:07.187
All I remember
is being there.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.955
I don't think we had a choice.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.791
What are you trying to say?

18:11.791 --> 18:14.294
It controls us?

18:14.294 --> 18:16.196
Why didn't you kill it?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.897
You had the rifle.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.632
You had a silver bullet.
You had the shot.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.000
Everett was too close.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.869
It was dark.

18:22.869 --> 18:23.936
I missed.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.605
Did you?

18:33.112 --> 18:35.014
Why is your heart
beating so fast?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.818
Why is your hand
shaking like that?

19:24.664 --> 19:25.932
What's wrong with you?

19:25.932 --> 19:27.800
I'm just having
a little anxiety.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.569
Oh, really?

19:29.569 --> 19:32.339
Because I'm having a lot,
and it's coming from you.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.875
I told you it was him.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.076
What's wrong?

19:37.076 --> 19:38.878
He's having a panic attack.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.113
No, I'm not.
It's--

19:41.113 --> 19:42.415
it's anxiety, okay?

19:42.415 --> 19:43.983
You need to learn
how to relax.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.485
No shit.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.420
Ugh, my heart, I can't
get my heart to slow down.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.021
Wow, I never--
I never tried that.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.257
What a great fucking idea.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.725
Everett, please stop.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.527
How is this my fault?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.229
Because you're having
a panic attack,

19:56.229 --> 19:57.764
and it's affecting us.

19:57.764 --> 19:58.898
It's not a panic attack.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.132
It's just an anxiety attack.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.601
What's the difference?

20:01.601 --> 20:03.403
Anxiety is triggered
by a stressor,

20:03.403 --> 20:04.804
and panic attacks can
come out of nowhere.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.607
So you're having anxiety,
and we're panicking

20:07.607 --> 20:09.776
because you know what's making
you anxious and we don't?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.311
I guess, kind of.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.613
Well, what the fuck is
making you so anxious?

20:13.613 --> 20:15.248
Maybe it's getting bit
by a werewolf,

20:15.248 --> 20:17.784
or getting chased
by a werewolf,

20:17.784 --> 20:19.118
or attacked by a werewolf,

20:19.118 --> 20:22.188
or my best fucking friend
killed by a werewolf.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.523
Stop saying "werewolf."

20:23.523 --> 20:26.293
- Werewolf.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.728
Werewolf, werewolf,
werewolf, werewolf, werewolf.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.697
Ah!

20:42.174 --> 20:43.310
What the fuck was that?

20:43.310 --> 20:45.378
You saw it?

20:45.378 --> 20:47.079
Fangs.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.781
So this is how it starts?

20:48.781 --> 20:50.283
We all get together.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.118
We get angry.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.253
Get fangs.
Get claws.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.622
And then we start
killing people?

21:04.130 --> 21:06.065
No.

21:06.065 --> 21:09.101
I'm not killing anyone.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.771
What if we don't
have a choice?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.075
We can't be around
each other.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.677
No.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.211
No, it's not like that.
It can't be.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.913
Fuck it.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.415
Maybe it is.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.417
Maybe it's exactly like that.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.088
Wolves hunt in packs.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.558
No, I'm not a wolf.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.461
And I'm not part of your pack.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.602
Everett.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.608
I didn't like them anyway.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.990
My favorite's
the one with two heads.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.760
I like this one
with the wings.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.861
Is that what
you were looking for

22:08.861 --> 22:11.498
when you crossed the fire line?

22:11.498 --> 22:13.500
Not exactly.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.903
Why did you cross
the line, Mr. Briggs?

22:16.903 --> 22:20.039
You left an entire
hotshot crew behind you.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.375
I thought they were
in front of me.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.377
That's what happens
when everything around you

22:24.377 --> 22:26.946
is covered in smoke.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.781
You've been in fires
before, right?

22:28.781 --> 22:30.282
Once or twice.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.423
So is this about
Harlan and Elizabeth?

22:36.423 --> 22:38.257
Luna.

22:38.257 --> 22:39.826
She likes Luna.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.764
And it's actually about me.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.399
I think I can help you.

22:46.399 --> 22:49.802
We already have a park ranger
on the task force advising us.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.772
I believe you know her,
Prisha Ahmad.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.408
She's one of our best.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.376
But she doesn't know
what I know.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.548
All right.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.616
Let's see what you know.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.869
You have an idea
of what killed this animal?

23:22.869 --> 23:26.072
My first guest would
be smoke inhalation.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.141
You have a guess about this?

23:29.141 --> 23:32.545
Have you seen my truck?

23:32.545 --> 23:34.113
Same thing.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.785
Does this thing have a name?

23:38.785 --> 23:41.521
Ursus americanus californiensis.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.922
California black bear.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.858
Probably
about 7 feet tall

23:45.858 --> 23:48.661
with claws that can rip
through steel.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.663
That's the exact same thing
Ms. Ahmad said.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.298
You don't believe her?

23:52.298 --> 23:54.601
Well, I don't think
it's a 7-foot tall monster

23:54.601 --> 23:56.202
with two heads and wings.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.906
But you're not so sure
it's a bear either.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.876
Thank you very much
for your time, Mr. Briggs.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.545
But like I said,

24:05.545 --> 24:08.447
we already have
a park ranger advising us.

24:08.447 --> 24:13.620
You're trying to find
another incendiary device

24:13.620 --> 24:16.589
because you know there's
a second origin point.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.943
You can draw, right?

24:36.943 --> 24:39.679
No, not really.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.313
Not really?

24:47.053 --> 24:48.955
These are great.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.691
If I describe
something to you,

24:51.691 --> 24:53.192
do you think you can draw it?

24:55.027 --> 24:57.163
I mean, I can try,

24:57.163 --> 24:59.932
so long as it's not a portrait.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.934
I'm not great with faces.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.917
What do you want me to draw?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.387
We found Miller's car.

25:21.387 --> 25:22.689
Where?

25:22.689 --> 25:25.057
Parked down the street
at Garrett Brigg's house.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.626
How far down the street?

25:26.626 --> 25:28.661
Not far enough.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.496
Is this standard practice
for Miller?

25:30.496 --> 25:33.265
I'm not sure I understand
the implication.

25:33.265 --> 25:36.736
Did he go there to beat
a confession out of a kid?

25:36.736 --> 25:38.137
I'll find him.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.772
We're looking
for an arsonist, Jang,

25:39.772 --> 25:42.141
a kid who's got an unhealthy
fascination with fire,

25:42.141 --> 25:44.944
not a drunk cop trying
to exercise his limited power

25:44.944 --> 25:46.779
over a bunch of teenagers.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.915
Find him on your own time.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.383
And he's off the task force.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.753
Understood.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.366
Taking off.
Watch Danny.

26:09.268 --> 26:12.404
Wait, Dad, I can't watch him.
I have work tonight.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.040
Tell 'em you're sick.
I've got an appointment

26:14.040 --> 26:15.274
with the disaster relief service.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.776
We're getting out
of this motel.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.110
They'll fire me.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.679
You work at a parking garage, Blake.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.013
They're not gonna fire you.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.115
Just order some food
and watch your brother.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.585
Oh, hey, I got you this.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.120
You got me a phone?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.521
I need to be able
to get ahold of you.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.057
- I don't want it.
- And I don't want

26:31.057 --> 26:32.625
you answering the phone here.

26:32.625 --> 26:36.428
Can you make life slightly
easier for me, just once?

26:36.428 --> 26:38.297
Wait, why don't you want me
answering the phone here?

26:38.297 --> 26:40.032
Some guy keeps calling.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.467
What guy?

26:41.467 --> 26:43.770
Some perv's whispering shit
over the phone.

26:43.770 --> 26:44.871
What'd he say?

26:44.871 --> 26:46.105
I didn't talk to him.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.173
Danny did.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.075
Watch him.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.178
Danny.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.515
Did you talk to someone
on the phone?

26:59.018 --> 27:01.754
Did you talk to a man
on the phone?

27:03.923 --> 27:05.658
What did he want?

27:05.658 --> 27:07.326
You.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.998
What do you mean?

27:11.998 --> 27:14.633
He wanted to talk to you.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.738
What did he say?

27:18.738 --> 27:19.972
Danny, this is very important.

27:19.972 --> 27:23.009
I need to know exactly
what he said.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.511
What did the man say?

27:25.511 --> 27:27.213
Danny.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.443
How's this look?

27:59.111 --> 28:01.180
The eyes are wrong.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.249
It's not like a cat.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.184
It's not slitted.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.791
More like this?

28:11.791 --> 28:15.294
Yeah, that's better.
Now do the claws.

28:16.796 --> 28:17.830
Not so curved.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.565
Sharper.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.076
What?

28:35.815 --> 28:37.516
You had it.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.118
Keep going.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.555
Luna, what's wrong?

28:51.163 --> 28:52.765
Are you okay?

28:55.001 --> 28:56.769
Yeah.

28:56.769 --> 29:00.539
Um, is this it?

29:00.539 --> 29:03.375
Is this what you think you saw?

29:13.085 --> 29:14.620
Austin--
- Don't.

29:17.023 --> 29:18.991
Don't say that you believe me,

29:18.991 --> 29:20.526
or that you know
it was traumatic,

29:20.526 --> 29:22.361
or there was lots of smoke,
or any of that bullshit,

29:22.361 --> 29:25.164
because I've heard it already.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.269
I believe you.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.004
I just said
you don't have to lie to me.

29:32.004 --> 29:35.041
I'm not lying, Austin.

29:35.041 --> 29:38.878
If you see it again, run.

29:43.549 --> 29:47.619
<i>♪ We can be alone ♪</i>

29:47.619 --> 29:51.623

29:51.623 --> 29:56.495

29:56.495 --> 30:00.499

30:08.607 --> 30:15.281

30:23.522 --> 30:24.924
How many times
are you gonna stare at me

30:24.924 --> 30:28.127
from across the room
before you finally say hi?

30:28.127 --> 30:30.529
Hi.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.439
- Have a good night.
- Night, night.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.509
Quiet, Danny.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.915
Hi.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.716
Hi, hi.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.484
You gonna repeat
everything I say?

31:41.667 --> 31:44.903
I can't remember his name,

31:44.903 --> 31:46.738
my horse.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.875
Thunder,
we were gonna buy the pair,

31:49.875 --> 31:51.877
Thunder and Lightning.

31:51.877 --> 31:55.614
But Harlan wanted
a bike instead.

31:55.614 --> 31:58.450
Thunder broke his leg, and--

31:58.450 --> 32:00.052
and you had to put him down.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.253
That's what you said.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.689
That's the story
we told everyone.

32:05.191 --> 32:08.360
But it was me, wasn't it?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.863
I'm the reason
you made the silver bullets.

32:11.863 --> 32:14.500
But you're not
the reason I kept them.

32:16.802 --> 32:19.005
Tell me what you remember.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.133
He kicked me.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.671
Why did he kick me?

33:25.671 --> 33:27.906
It was the full moon.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.441
He sensed something
different in you,

33:29.441 --> 33:31.577
and it scared him.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.015
I heard you scream.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.528
I ran in and saw the blood
on your hands.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.897
At first,
I thought it was yours.

33:53.465 --> 33:56.402
But then I saw the horse.

33:56.402 --> 33:59.405
The blood was everywhere.

33:59.405 --> 34:01.707
I couldn't figure it out.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.578
But then I took your hand, and...

34:08.747 --> 34:10.149
I didn't see claws.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.584
I didn't see anything,

34:12.584 --> 34:14.320
until I looked in your eyes.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.421
What did you see?

34:15.421 --> 34:18.224
I saw the wolf,

34:18.224 --> 34:20.226
the wolf inside you.

34:21.627 --> 34:22.861
I thought to myself,

34:22.861 --> 34:25.631
a wolf doesn't feel bad
about killing.

34:25.631 --> 34:28.267
It kills because
it's a predator.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.702
And after that night,
I did everything I could

34:30.702 --> 34:33.605
to teach you and Harlan
how to keep the wolf at bay,

34:33.605 --> 34:37.809
how to keep
the predator inside you caged.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.978
Nothing like that
ever happened again.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.647
I've never seen claws,
or fangs,

34:41.647 --> 34:45.351
or anything like it
on you or Harlan.

34:45.351 --> 34:47.052
It worked.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.523
Until now.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.907
<i>♪ You do me, I do you ♪</i>

35:08.907 --> 35:11.477
<i>♪ Feed me lies,

35:16.348 --> 35:18.817
It was my dad's.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.953
Why would a firefighter
carry a lighter?

35:21.953 --> 35:25.924
'Cause sometimes you gotta
fight fire with fire.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.061
It's just a lighter, dude.

35:30.061 --> 35:31.430
I never met my dad,

35:31.430 --> 35:36.067
so it's all I've got from him.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.703
What happened?

35:42.408 --> 35:43.809
He died in a fire.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.815
You wanna hear my sad,
sad story,

35:49.815 --> 35:51.783
or do you want another hit?

35:53.652 --> 35:55.354
I'll take another hit.

36:08.267 --> 36:11.503
Didn't you have a girlfriend
last semester?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.939
Yeah.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.041
So?

36:16.041 --> 36:18.310
So how come you don't
have a girlfriend now?

36:18.310 --> 36:21.213
Who says I don't?

36:21.213 --> 36:22.981
Do you?

36:24.416 --> 36:26.952
No.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.554
How come you don't
have a boyfriend?

36:28.554 --> 36:30.222
Who says I don't?

36:31.857 --> 36:33.992

37:16.935 --> 37:20.105
Hey, there's no ticket.

37:20.105 --> 37:23.041
It's not printing a ticket.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.877
Oh, I forgot you worked here.

37:25.877 --> 37:29.047
Slashing tires isn't,
like, part of the job, is it?

37:29.047 --> 37:31.016
I told you that wasn't me.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.918
Okay,
can you open this thing?

37:32.918 --> 37:34.820
We're late for a movie.

37:42.661 --> 37:46.465
You do look nice, your skin.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.166
We're seeing a movie.
You want to come?

37:48.166 --> 37:52.838
Um, I'm working.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.540
Have fun.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.975
We will. Thanks.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.580
News.

38:01.580 --> 38:02.781
News, now.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.249
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't touch that.

38:04.249 --> 38:05.351
- News.
- No, no.

38:05.351 --> 38:06.652
It's not that kind of TV.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.019
- News, now.
- No, Danny, stop.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.087
Danny.
Danny, stop.

38:16.328 --> 38:19.130
Ow, Danny, you hit me.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.399
Remember, it's not okay to hit.

38:20.399 --> 38:23.835
No hitting.
No hitting.

38:57.302 --> 38:59.538
- Hi, hi.
- Stay down.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.048
Hello?

39:12.150 --> 39:13.919
Hello?

39:33.338 --> 39:35.340
Late for a movie?

39:43.482 --> 39:45.083
Ugh, shit.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.387
I need to check something.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.022
Stay here, okay?

39:53.391 --> 39:55.627
I'm gonna lock the door.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.796
I'll be back in five minutes.

40:00.766 --> 40:01.867
Five minutes.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.456
Phoebe?

40:37.102 --> 40:39.370
Phoebe?

40:43.308 --> 40:45.110
Oh, my God.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.245
There's no way he said that.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.147
I'm serious, he did.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.849
Oh, shit.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.884
Aren't you late for a movie?

40:52.884 --> 40:55.220
It's just the trailers.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.288
We're seeing a movie?

40:57.288 --> 40:58.757
Oh, my God.

40:58.757 --> 41:00.258
No more weed for you, girl.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.860
No.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.593
Jerry?

42:55.340 --> 42:57.208
Danny.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.377
As of 9:22 p.m. Thursday,

42:59.377 --> 43:03.214
<i>state officials reported

43:03.214 --> 43:06.184

44:16.654 --> 44:18.156
Danny?

44:24.462 --> 44:25.997
Danny?

44:28.867 --> 44:30.501
Danny, where are you?

44:30.501 --> 44:32.037
Danny?

44:33.204 --> 44:34.973
Danny?

44:39.044 --> 44:40.712
Danny?

44:40.712 --> 44:42.280
Where are you?

44:43.381 --> 44:44.983
Where are you?

44:44.983 --> 44:46.617
Danny?

44:51.056 --> 44:53.258
Danny?

45:02.734 --> 45:04.202
Danny?

45:25.256 --> 45:31.129
Danny!

45:40.005 --> 45:41.739
Come on, come on, come on.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.441
Dad, Dad, it's me.

45:43.441 --> 45:44.575
You have
to call me back, please.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.711
I--I can't find Danny.

45:46.711 --> 45:48.113
I left him here
for five minutes.

45:48.113 --> 45:49.580
And I locked the door,
I swear to God.

45:49.580 --> 45:50.615
And I can't find him.

45:50.615 --> 45:52.517
You have
to call me back, please.

45:52.517 --> 45:54.252
Please just call me back.

46:26.417 --> 46:27.585
Are you okay?

46:27.585 --> 46:29.354
Oh, Danny, look at me.
Where were you?

46:36.794 --> 46:38.396
It was here.

46:43.935 --> 46:46.504
Wait, what are you doing here?

46:46.504 --> 46:48.239
I heard you.

46:48.239 --> 46:49.207
You what?

46:49.207 --> 46:51.642
I heard you scream his name.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.644
From where?

46:53.644 --> 46:55.813
My house.

46:55.813 --> 46:58.549
How did you get here so fast?

46:58.549 --> 47:01.652
I don't know.
I th--

47:01.652 --> 47:03.454
I think I ran.

47:15.133 --> 47:18.536
You heard me too.

47:18.536 --> 47:21.172
You heard me scream his name.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.407
Yeah.

47:22.407 --> 47:24.142
Why?

47:24.142 --> 47:26.912
Because you didn't scream.

47:26.912 --> 47:29.847
You howled.

47:39.690 --> 47:42.260
Oh, you scared me.

47:42.260 --> 47:43.861
Can I help you with something?

47:43.861 --> 47:45.363
Yeah.

47:45.363 --> 47:46.998
You can give this to her.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.635
Tell her it's for her wall.

50:01.099 --> 50:02.267
It kills every night.

50:02.267 --> 50:04.402
<i>And now it's killing for you.</i>

50:05.470 --> 50:06.837
Slow down!

50:06.837 --> 50:08.206
Are we not trying
to save someone's life?

50:08.206 --> 50:10.108
You do want to know
something, don't you?

50:10.108 --> 50:11.376
It's still here!

50:11.376 --> 50:12.977
You're practically doing
my job for me.

50:12.977 --> 50:14.011
Guys.
