        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:04.604 --> 00:06.071
Hey, Woody,                     
come here a second, man.        

00:06.139 --> 00:07.740
Something's really              
bugging me.                     

00:07.807 --> 00:09.308
        Whatever it is,         
          I don't know          

00:09.376 --> 00:11.477
what you're talking about.      

00:11.544 --> 00:13.145
            'Cause I've never   
            lied about anything.

00:14.247 --> 00:15.714
                  This is Woody,
                    remember?   

00:15.815 --> 00:18.717
Company man, team player,       
        true blue.              

00:18.785 --> 00:20.019
                 You know, maybe
                     if you turn

00:20.086 --> 00:21.420
                 that microscope
                    on yourself,

00:21.488 --> 00:23.622
      you might find some things
          that aren't so pretty.

00:25.558 --> 00:27.292
          I can't work          
      in this atmosphere,       

00:27.360 --> 00:29.061
    all this suspicion          

00:29.129 --> 00:30.396
    and this constant           
         interrogation.         

00:30.463 --> 00:32.097
              What do you people
                want from me?   

00:32.165 --> 00:33.666
        I didn't do anything,   
                      all right?

00:33.733 --> 00:35.634
                I'm telling you,
                  I am innocent!

00:36.770 --> 00:39.338
                     Okay, okay.

00:40.407 --> 00:41.774
                    You remember
            three months ago,   

00:41.841 --> 00:43.676
            that day I called   
                        in sick?
Woody...                        

00:43.743 --> 00:45.878
              Sam, shut up, it's
                my turn to talk!

00:45.979 --> 00:47.680
                I... I was sick,

00:47.747 --> 00:49.782
    but a couple hours later,   
    I started feeling better,   

00:49.849 --> 00:52.284
          and I could've come in
          for half a day, but...

00:52.352 --> 00:54.520
                    (crying):   
            instead, I stayed   
            home and did laundry

00:54.587 --> 00:57.756
        and watched Oprah 'cause
    she had circus freaks on.   

00:57.824 --> 00:59.792
                 I'm so ashamed!

01:02.162 --> 01:04.530
                  Oh, good, that
                feels better.   

01:04.596 --> 01:07.333
         I've been carrying that
        around for three months.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.767
                (deep breath)   

01:08.835 --> 01:10.969
I was just gonna say            
your tag's sticking up          

01:11.037 --> 01:13.172
on your sweater here.           

01:14.107 --> 01:15.541
                        Oh.     

01:15.608 --> 01:17.776
            Well, then forget   
                I said anything.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.880
                      I was just
            kidding you, Sam.   

01:21.948 --> 01:23.349
            Just kidding you.   

01:23.416 --> 01:26.418
 I think I covered pretty well. 

01:29.155 --> 01:33.158

02:41.094 --> 02:44.229
             Oh, good afternoon,
                  Miss Tortelli.

02:44.297 --> 02:47.433
          Well, if it isn't John
              Cougar Mellonhead.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.102
Thank you for last night,       
Miss Tortelli.                  

02:50.170 --> 02:52.237
                I wasn't with   
                 you last night.
I know,                         

02:52.305 --> 02:54.139
and don't think                 
I don't appreciate it.          

02:56.109 --> 02:57.810
            Oh, Sam!            

02:57.877 --> 03:00.112
                 Yes, John, what
            can I do for you?   

03:00.180 --> 03:02.414
                Sam, I have a   
                  small request.

03:02.482 --> 03:04.950
    For the next three hours,   
         I need you and the rest

03:05.018 --> 03:07.586
            of the Cheers chimps
         to hold down the noise.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.521
                  Right now, I'm
                    entertaining

03:09.622 --> 03:11.123
            200 elderly women   

03:11.191 --> 03:12.791
        from the Daughters of   
        the American Revolution.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.060
         Giving them a firsthand
                  account, John?

03:15.128 --> 03:17.096
                Very amusing.   

03:17.163 --> 03:20.332
         Sam, this vent connects
      directly to my dining room

03:20.400 --> 03:23.302
          and often, we can hear
everything you say down here,   

03:23.370 --> 03:26.338
      so tell your mailman to go
         to <i>that</i> side of the bar

03:26.406 --> 03:29.308
         if he wants to describe
          his fungal infections.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.144
You know, I have                
to second that.                 

03:32.212 --> 03:34.179
    Well, sure, John.           

03:34.247 --> 03:36.148
 Heck, you should've come down  
      and told us sooner.       

03:36.216 --> 03:37.483
 We'll be happy to oblige you.  

03:37.550 --> 03:39.018
Well, thank you, Sam.           

03:39.085 --> 03:41.587
That's uncharacteristically     
civil of you.                   

03:41.654 --> 03:43.055
Oh!                             

03:43.123 --> 03:46.091
  If you all behave yourselves  
for the next three hours,       

03:46.159 --> 03:48.160
    maybe I'll take you out     
         for ice cream.         

03:48.228 --> 03:50.462
      Would you like that?      

03:52.432 --> 03:55.934
Why don't you just              
get lost, you sweathog.         

03:56.002 --> 03:57.002
                      Sewer rat.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.537
  Bag of bones.                 
                     Maggot.    

04:00.907 --> 04:04.476
    Am I the only one           
who finds him really attractive?

04:04.544 --> 04:07.479
        You believe that guy?   
        So damned condescending.

04:07.547 --> 04:08.947
Ah, Sammy, not so loud.         

04:09.015 --> 04:11.183
He'll get angry--               
we won't get the ice cream.     

04:11.251 --> 04:13.986
  I think I'm on to something.  

04:14.054 --> 04:15.020
        (chuckles)              

04:15.088 --> 04:16.855
                            SAM:
                     Yeah, yeah,
                    here you go.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.589
     (high-pitched voice):      
        Eek, eek!               

04:18.658 --> 04:19.892
    Oh, there's a rat!          

04:19.959 --> 04:23.062
          Oh, my God,           
    there's another big rat!    

04:23.163 --> 04:25.197
        (numerous               
    running footsteps)          

04:25.265 --> 04:29.068
        (rumbling)              

04:29.135 --> 04:30.402
         (Sam laughing)         

04:30.503 --> 04:33.205
          I think that          
      was very successful!      

04:33.273 --> 04:36.375
     Except you got a bunch     
 of dust in my beer here, Sam.  

04:36.443 --> 04:38.911
             Um, sorry, I'll get
                you another one.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.882
HILL:                           
Sam!                            

04:43.950 --> 04:45.984
  Before I spend the remainder  
        of the afternoon        

04:46.052 --> 04:48.620
    trying to sort out          
     whose walker is whose,     

04:48.688 --> 04:50.789
I want to say                   
one thing.                      

04:50.857 --> 04:53.525
    I live for the day          
 when I can close this bar down 

04:53.593 --> 04:55.894
          and put you           
    out on the street.          

04:55.962 --> 04:57.763
                  Eh, he doesn't
                    scare me.   

04:57.831 --> 05:00.099
      You ought to see him      
 with just the night light on.  

05:03.136 --> 05:04.236
Hey, everybody.                 

05:04.304 --> 05:05.804
Got everything                  
we need                         

05:05.905 --> 05:07.206
  for our marathon poker fest.  

05:07.340 --> 05:08.874
                Yeah? Did you   
                bring the chips?

05:08.942 --> 05:10.275
    Oh, yeah, I've got, uh,     

05:10.343 --> 05:12.077
      red ones, blue ones,      
         white ones...          

05:12.145 --> 05:13.445
             No, no, no--       
              the chips!        

05:13.513 --> 05:15.781
        Ranch, mesquite,        
             sour cream.        

05:15.849 --> 05:18.550
         Don't you have any idea
          how to play this game?

05:18.618 --> 05:19.818
    Yeah, I think so.           

05:19.919 --> 05:21.653
        So, you guys having a   
            big poker game, huh?

05:21.721 --> 05:22.921
                        NORM:   
                            Yep.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.790
You know, uh,                   
I always wanted                 

05:24.858 --> 05:26.325
to learn how to play that game. 

05:26.426 --> 05:28.727
You, uh, you never              
played poker there, Woody?      

05:28.828 --> 05:29.928
              No.               

05:29.996 --> 05:31.964
        Played all kinds        
of card games in Hanover,       

05:32.032 --> 05:33.298
        but never poker.        

05:33.400 --> 05:35.267
I was pretty good, too.         

05:35.368 --> 05:36.835
I'd win all the time.           
                        Yeah?   

05:36.936 --> 05:40.272
    Yeah, chicken in a box,     
    one-eyed rooster,           

05:40.340 --> 05:41.907
    possum on a pole.           

05:41.975 --> 05:43.842
                    What kind of
                 games are that?

05:43.943 --> 05:46.445
    No, no, no, that's          
      what the winner got.      

05:49.015 --> 05:51.216
            You know, guys, I   
                 think it's time

05:51.284 --> 05:52.918
            Woody learned how to
            play a little poker.

05:52.986 --> 05:53.852
                    Yeah?       
    Really?                     

05:53.920 --> 05:54.920
    Thanks a lot.               

05:54.988 --> 05:56.388
    How can I ever              
thank you guys?                 

05:56.456 --> 06:00.025
         Oh, I don't know, we'll
          think of a way, Woody.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.827
          Say, you guys got, uh,
              room for one more?

06:01.928 --> 06:04.229
Uh, well, yeah, okay,           
it's all right with us,         

06:04.297 --> 06:06.231
but I've got to warn you,       
we're gonna be playing          

06:06.299 --> 06:07.466
into the wee smalls.            

06:07.534 --> 06:09.101
Uh, you might want              
to check                        

06:09.169 --> 06:11.103
with the old                    
"ball and Crane."               

06:13.206 --> 06:15.574
             I don't have to ask
        Lilith if I can play.   

06:15.642 --> 06:16.575
              I'm an independent
                         person.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.843
                I can make my   
                  own decisions.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.279
It's all right                  
with me, Frasier.               

06:20.380 --> 06:21.780
                I wasn't asking.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.082
Regardless,                     
I still approve.                

06:23.149 --> 06:24.783
        Well, approve all you   
         want to-- I don't care.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.785
        I'm gonna play poker,   
                  stay out late.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.921
Stay out all night              
if you like.                    

06:28.988 --> 06:29.988
You have                        
my permission.                  

06:30.056 --> 06:31.990
                        Stop it.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.360
Very well, Frasier.             

06:34.427 --> 06:36.228
Please stay home                
with your wife and child.       

06:36.296 --> 06:37.262
We need you.                    

06:37.330 --> 06:38.564
              Forget it, woman--
                    gotta be me!

06:38.631 --> 06:40.632
              Let's party, boys.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.900
                        NORM:   
              Sammy, are you in?

06:41.968 --> 06:44.570
No, I gotta make sure things run
      out here, you know?       

06:44.637 --> 06:46.338
      I can't concentrate       
          on the game           

06:46.406 --> 06:47.740
and the bar                     
at the same time.               

06:47.907 --> 06:49.708
What about me?                  
What am I here for?             

06:49.776 --> 06:51.343
                     Oh, right--
             and I have to worry

06:51.411 --> 06:52.478
             about Rebecca, too.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.082
You know, Sam,                  
that really ticks me off.       

06:57.150 --> 06:58.951
If you don't appreciate         
what I do,                      

06:59.019 --> 07:00.152
why don't I just quit?          

07:00.220 --> 07:01.787
                    Oh, come on,
                sweetheart, I...

07:01.855 --> 07:03.589
         I appreciate everything
             you do around here.

07:03.656 --> 07:04.957
Really?                         
                        Yeah.   

07:05.125 --> 07:06.492
What do I do?                   

07:07.560 --> 07:09.294
                         Well...

07:09.362 --> 07:12.498
        now, come on, don't back
    me in a corner like this.   

07:14.567 --> 07:16.235
        So, it's not worth it   
              to have me around.

07:16.302 --> 07:17.269
                    I'm useless,
                     is that it?

07:17.337 --> 07:19.538
No, come on, honey,             
you are real valuable           

07:19.606 --> 07:22.041
around here doing...            

07:22.108 --> 07:24.343
all the things                  
that you do, all right?         

07:26.212 --> 07:28.047
All right, fine, listen,        
all right, all right.           

07:28.114 --> 07:29.248
                If it'll make   
                you feel better,

07:29.315 --> 07:30.683
        I'll go play a little   
            poker, all right?   

07:30.750 --> 07:32.284
            You can take care   
             of things out here.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.585
    Okay, don't think           
         that I can't.          

07:33.653 --> 07:36.188
    I mean, I am competent.     
      I am damn competent.      

07:36.256 --> 07:37.690
You know, I mean,               
I'm not just some lackey        

07:37.757 --> 07:40.926
  who carries receipts around   
  in a cigar box all day long.  

07:40.994 --> 07:42.594
                  I mean, I know
                 what I'm doing.

07:42.662 --> 07:43.896
    I have a business degree.   

07:43.963 --> 07:45.564
And I have a lot                
of experience.                  

07:45.632 --> 07:49.535
            And I am very, very,
        very good at doing...   

07:49.602 --> 07:53.072
                  all the things
                      that I do.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.340
Like what?                      

07:54.407 --> 07:57.076
        Hey, come on, don't back
          me in the corner here.

08:04.617 --> 08:08.787
You know, there is nothing      
like a good cigar.              

08:13.893 --> 08:16.295
      And this is nothing       
    like a good cigar.          

08:17.797 --> 08:19.131
    Yeah, this blanket ought    
    to keep the smoke           

08:19.299 --> 08:20.232
    away from the customers.    

08:20.300 --> 08:23.168
         Good idea, Sammy--     
            more for us.        

08:23.269 --> 08:24.570
Guys, I've gotta be honest      
        with you.               

08:24.637 --> 08:26.338
    I was just trying           
    to hustle you out there.    

08:26.406 --> 08:28.240
 I do know how                  
 to play poker.                 

08:28.308 --> 08:29.608
 And to tell you                
 the truth,                     

08:29.676 --> 08:31.777
I was the best poker player     
in Hanover.                     

08:31.845 --> 08:33.011
Uh-huh.                         
                          WOODY:
                    Actually,   

08:33.145 --> 08:34.947
  I was the best poker player   

08:35.015 --> 08:37.316
         in the entire          
      metro Hanover area.       

08:37.417 --> 08:39.518
                Well, uh,       

08:39.586 --> 08:41.419
  you're in the city            
     now, Woody.                

08:41.488 --> 08:43.188
    Well, I guess you           
    do play different           

08:43.256 --> 08:44.590
than a bunch of farm boys.      

08:44.657 --> 08:46.892
    Oh, yeah.                   
                Yes, we do.     

08:46.960 --> 08:48.527
                Why don't you   
              sit down, Woodrow.

08:48.628 --> 08:49.762
                     Oh, thanks.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.163
                          WOODY:
             Take it easy on me.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.265
              Okay, okay.       

08:53.333 --> 08:55.968
     So, what sort of game would
          you like to play, huh?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.604
    Well, how about, uh,...     

08:58.672 --> 09:01.373
      "Five blind piglets       
      and one full teat?"       

09:01.441 --> 09:03.442
              What the heck kind
                of game is that?

09:03.510 --> 09:06.078
  That's where five city boys   
     lose all their money.      

09:16.489 --> 09:18.390
Oh, Lilith, being               
in charge again                 

09:18.491 --> 09:19.858
is so invigorating.             

09:19.926 --> 09:21.627
I feel great!                   

09:21.695 --> 09:23.295
This will                       
really show Sam.                

09:23.363 --> 09:24.363
                     Bravo.     

09:24.431 --> 09:26.131
  Some men still need to learn  

09:26.199 --> 09:29.068
  that women can take on roles  
traditionally held by men       

09:29.135 --> 09:30.969
    and perform them as well    
        or better.              

09:31.037 --> 09:33.939
            We live in an era of
          female brain surgeons,

09:34.007 --> 09:36.308
          astronauts,           
    Supreme Court Justices.     

09:36.376 --> 09:37.710
    And bar managers.           

09:37.877 --> 09:39.745
              Yes.              

09:41.881 --> 09:44.283
Do you see the nifty way        
I always keep this down?        

09:44.351 --> 09:47.820
It creates much more            
surface area for new drinks.    

09:47.887 --> 09:49.054
Coming through!                 

09:52.225 --> 09:53.826
Of course, I still              
have to iron out                

09:53.893 --> 09:55.094
a few of the kinks.             

09:55.195 --> 09:57.830
    Oh, hey, Rebecca,           
     this letter came back.     

09:59.132 --> 10:01.867
    Oh, dear, I must have put   
        the wrong postage on it.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.936
                Uh-oh.          

10:04.004 --> 10:05.404
    What?                       

10:05.472 --> 10:09.708
          It's a renewal for our
          liquor license, and...

10:09.776 --> 10:12.544
          I was supposed to have
    sent it in two weeks ago.   

10:12.612 --> 10:14.613
What are you saying?            

10:14.681 --> 10:16.048
We have no                      
liquor license?                 

10:17.083 --> 10:18.817
                        Yeah.   

10:20.487 --> 10:23.188
Do you realize we're            
serving alcohol in here?        

10:23.256 --> 10:25.024
I mean, they could              
shut us down forever.           

10:25.091 --> 10:26.258
                 I know.        

10:26.326 --> 10:29.361
             I'm okay, I'm okay,
            I'm in charge.      

10:29.429 --> 10:30.562
            This is a crisis,   
                that's right,   

10:30.630 --> 10:31.563
          but I can handle this.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.198
I will                          
simply call                     

10:33.266 --> 10:35.100
          the state liquor board
    and I... I will tell them   

10:35.168 --> 10:36.969
      I screwed up and I am sure
        they will understand.   

10:37.070 --> 10:38.871
And what are we supposed to do  
in the meantime?                

10:38.938 --> 10:41.140
          Well, no one will know
    if we don't say anything,   

10:41.207 --> 10:42.508
                so you just keep
                your mouth shut.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.476
         You are to tell no one,
      do you understand? No one!

10:44.544 --> 10:46.145
Gotcha.                         

10:46.212 --> 10:47.913
      Where are you going?      
                    To tell Sam.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.548
              No!               

10:49.616 --> 10:50.916
        If you tell Sam,        

10:50.984 --> 10:53.318
he won't even let me carry      
     the cigar box around!      

10:53.386 --> 10:54.453
                         I know.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.722
                  That's why I'm
                 gonna tell him.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.824
All right,                      
you evil thing.                 

10:58.892 --> 11:00.092
What do you want?               

11:00.160 --> 11:01.794
                     (chortling)

11:01.861 --> 11:04.129
          Let's see, what do you
            think would be fair?

11:04.197 --> 11:07.433
 Say, uh, Carla, we're supposed 
    to be Rebecca's friends.    

11:07.500 --> 11:08.734
Now, I could just               
as easily say,                  

11:08.802 --> 11:11.070
"Rebecca, I'm gonna tell Sam    
unless you sleep with me."      

11:11.137 --> 11:12.738
            Exactly!            

11:12.806 --> 11:15.040
So, will you?                   

11:15.108 --> 11:16.408
LILITH:                         
Paul.                           

11:16.476 --> 11:18.911
She forgot to renew             
a liquor license.               

11:18.978 --> 11:21.480
      She didn't burn down      
         an orphanage.          

11:24.484 --> 11:25.984
                  How's it going
                    out here?   

11:26.052 --> 11:27.019
Fine, fine!                     

11:27.087 --> 11:28.287
I'm in charge!                  

11:28.355 --> 11:29.321
                     Good, good.
Uh, you don't                   
even need                       

11:29.389 --> 11:30.723
to come out here,               
not even for a second.          

11:30.790 --> 11:32.324
          I just want to get the
          fellas some more beer.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.326
Sam, if you need beer,          
I'll bring you the beer.        

11:34.394 --> 11:35.761
Sam, this is your day           
to relax.                       

11:35.829 --> 11:37.162
          Hey, Sammy.           
                        REBECCA:
                        Paul!   

11:37.230 --> 11:39.465
            Do you want to go   
            out with me tonight?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.035
Just the two of us?             

11:44.037 --> 11:46.605
I suppose so.                   

11:46.673 --> 11:48.707
    Paul, is there something    
        you want to say?        

11:48.775 --> 11:50.943
Forget it,                      
I just got lucky.               

11:51.011 --> 11:53.946
             Rebecca, come here.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.881
              Y-You're going out
            to dinner with Paul?

11:55.949 --> 11:57.816
    Yes, I am.                  

11:57.884 --> 12:00.619
You know, y-you might want to   
    think about computer dating.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.788
                      Ads in the
                      personals.

12:02.856 --> 12:06.392
I underst--                     
I'll bring you the beer.        

12:06.459 --> 12:07.493
CARLA:                          
Okay, Becks.                    

12:07.560 --> 12:08.694
 They said you just have to go  

12:08.762 --> 12:10.529
down to the liquor license      
board in the morning            

12:10.597 --> 12:12.064
and they'll rubber-stamp        
the renewal.                    

12:12.132 --> 12:13.465
                Oh, good.       
In the meantime,                

12:13.533 --> 12:14.533
we just can't serve             
any alcohol.                    
                        Okay,   

12:14.601 --> 12:15.534
                  we can't serve
                    any alcohol.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.136
                     Fine, I can
                 deal with that.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.638
         Miss, I'd like a Scotch
            and soda, please.   

12:19.706 --> 12:22.541
        We're all out of Scotch.

12:22.609 --> 12:23.842
How about a bourbon?            

12:24.010 --> 12:25.110
                    We're out   
                     of bourbon.

12:25.211 --> 12:26.478
What's that behind you?         

12:26.613 --> 12:27.813
                     I don't see
                    anything.   

12:27.881 --> 12:29.181
Right there, behind you--       
all those bottles.              

12:29.249 --> 12:31.316
                  I said I don't
                see anything!   

12:31.384 --> 12:32.751
 Carla, Carla, it's all right.  

12:32.819 --> 12:36.422
          Sir, here is          
     your Scotch and soda.      

12:36.489 --> 12:37.556
      Rebecca.                  
                 It's all right.

12:37.624 --> 12:38.991
                  I have a plan,
                just watch this.

12:39.059 --> 12:39.992
                    Here you go.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.026
                     N-N-N-N-No.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.594
                    I don't need
                      any money.

12:42.696 --> 12:43.862
         I want you to take this

12:43.930 --> 12:45.664
            and just think of it
             as a gift from me--

12:45.732 --> 12:47.966
                Rebecca Howe,   
                 private citizen

12:48.034 --> 12:51.537
        and in no way affiliated
                  with this bar.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.506
Thanks.                         

12:55.575 --> 12:56.742
         You see that?          

12:56.810 --> 12:58.544
That's all we have to do,       
that's the answer.              

12:58.611 --> 13:00.813
All we have to do is give       
everybody free alcohol          

13:00.880 --> 13:02.348
and not take any money          
for it,                         

13:02.415 --> 13:04.850
and this bar can stay           
in business forever.            

13:06.252 --> 13:07.753
     Ow!                        

13:07.821 --> 13:10.189
            Rebecca,            
    let me get that for you.    

13:10.256 --> 13:11.523
              Ow!               

13:11.591 --> 13:12.791
                         LILITH:
I'm sorry, are you all right?   

13:12.926 --> 13:13.959
Yes, just put it down.          

13:14.027 --> 13:16.128
Ow!                             
        Oh!                     

13:25.271 --> 13:27.072
Rebecca?                        
              Yes?              

13:27.140 --> 13:29.174
                You're taking   
              money for a drink?

13:29.242 --> 13:31.577
    I thought the plan was to   
        give them away for free.

13:31.678 --> 13:32.711
No, see, I realized             

13:32.779 --> 13:34.146
we couldn't really afford       
to do that                      

13:34.214 --> 13:36.615
about $1,200 ago,               

13:36.683 --> 13:39.018
so now what we're doing         
is tricking them.               

13:39.085 --> 13:40.719
You see, Carla and I            
have taken all the bottles      

13:40.787 --> 13:41.854
and put colored water           
in them,                        

13:41.921 --> 13:43.489
and we're serving               
non-alcoholic beer              

13:43.556 --> 13:45.691
                         Aha.   
and soft drinks.                

13:45.759 --> 13:47.826
Can I have a strawberry         
daiquiri, miss?                 

13:47.894 --> 13:49.261
                 Oh, yes, coming
                    right up.   

13:49.329 --> 13:52.031
                     Kool-Aid on
                    crushed ice.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.099
                Hey, Rebecca.   

13:54.200 --> 13:55.634
            Hi, Sam.            

13:55.702 --> 13:56.969
            I came for some more
             beers for the guys.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.203
        They're going through   
             it like it's water.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.571
  Well, it's not.               

14:02.475 --> 14:04.476
        You, you sure everything
             is going all right?

14:04.544 --> 14:05.511
Yes, you'll get your beer.      

14:05.578 --> 14:07.413
Just get back in there,         
go on.                          

14:07.480 --> 14:08.414
                      All right.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.718
This is very interesting,       
            Rebecca.            

14:12.786 --> 14:15.020
        Allow me to help        
    in your little charade.     

14:15.088 --> 14:17.589
        (loudly):               
I'd like a Scotch, please.      

14:17.657 --> 14:20.359
    (in normal voice):          
     I've done some acting      
          in my time.           

14:23.630 --> 14:25.564
                      Thank you.

14:29.469 --> 14:33.138
                         Whoa!  

14:33.206 --> 14:34.940
                    (coughs)    

14:35.008 --> 14:36.742
                        Smooth! 

14:38.411 --> 14:40.446
That was very good,             
Lilith.                         

14:40.513 --> 14:43.749
        You really have         
a mischievous side to you.      

14:43.817 --> 14:45.751
      I was <i>The Bad Seed</i>        
        in high school.         

14:45.819 --> 14:47.519
    Whoa, scary play.           

14:47.587 --> 14:50.255
Oh, that's right, it <i>was</i> a play.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.826
Excuse me, miss.                

14:53.993 --> 14:55.594
My rum and Coke here tastes     

14:55.662 --> 14:57.896
an awful lot                    
like Coke and coffee.           

14:57.964 --> 15:01.667
                      Oh, let me
                     smell that.

15:01.735 --> 15:05.304
        Oh... that rum smells   
            pretty strong to me.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.039
                Hey, you know...

15:07.107 --> 15:10.843
            when you can't smell
        or taste the alcohol,   

15:10.910 --> 15:12.511
              that's a sign that
             you might be having

15:12.579 --> 15:14.113
                        a little
            drinking problem.   

15:14.180 --> 15:15.280
        Excuse me?              

15:15.348 --> 15:16.949
            I think you ought   
            to get some help.   

15:17.017 --> 15:19.785
      In the meantime, how about
        another rum and Coke?   

15:19.853 --> 15:21.854
                  We just put up
                    a fresh pot.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.089
      Forget it.                

15:24.157 --> 15:25.024
                 Look, everybody
                     is leaving.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.725
     So?                        

15:26.793 --> 15:28.961
So, if Sam finds out, th-then   
he'll know something's wrong.   

15:29.029 --> 15:30.829
        Come on, get those guys,
             get them back here.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.164
      Uh, excuse me, sir.       

15:32.232 --> 15:35.234
                Can I talk to   
                you a minute?   

15:35.301 --> 15:37.636
        (Carla speaking         
            quietly)            

15:41.808 --> 15:43.942
      (indistinct chatter)      

15:44.010 --> 15:45.844
                Wow, what did   
                you say to them?

15:45.912 --> 15:47.613
Oh, I just told them            
that in a few minutes           

15:47.681 --> 15:48.847
you're going to                 
take off your clothes           

15:48.915 --> 15:51.350
and dance on the tables in      
just your bra and panties.      

15:52.419 --> 15:55.454
                Good thinking.  

15:55.522 --> 15:57.389
You sure everything's okay      
        back here?              
Oh!                             

15:57.457 --> 15:59.324
     Yeah, ev-everything's,     
    everything's just fine.     

15:59.392 --> 16:01.727
         Come on, baby,         
      show us your stuff.       

16:01.828 --> 16:02.928
            What-What's that?   

16:02.996 --> 16:04.329
             What are they, what
                are they saying?

16:04.397 --> 16:05.497
Oh, it's, it's nothing.         

16:05.565 --> 16:08.667
I just have some stuff          
and... they want to see it.     

16:08.735 --> 16:11.136
Now go on back in there,        
come on.                        

16:11.204 --> 16:12.738
We're just about ready          
to get that beer for you.       

16:12.806 --> 16:14.973
Go on, there's more beer        
on its way.                     

16:15.041 --> 16:16.742
                      All right,
                      all right.

16:16.843 --> 16:19.244
 Carla, take some non-alcoholic 
 beer back there to those guys. 

16:19.312 --> 16:20.446
    I thought you were going    
          to do that.           

16:20.580 --> 16:22.748
      I have a show to do.      

16:35.128 --> 16:37.062
Here you go, guys.              

16:37.130 --> 16:38.630
It's your fifth round.          

16:38.698 --> 16:40.399
  Hope you can handle it.       

16:40.467 --> 16:42.368
        What does               
    that mean, Carla?           

16:42.435 --> 16:44.003
            Nothing.            

16:44.070 --> 16:45.771
         Wait a minute,         
 what did you put in the beer?  

16:45.872 --> 16:47.039
            Nothing.            

16:48.608 --> 16:50.743
                    You know,   

16:50.844 --> 16:52.845
fellas, normally                
I'm a great believer            

16:52.912 --> 16:54.113
in responsible drinking,        

16:54.180 --> 16:56.915
but, uh, boy, this stuff        
really goes down easy.          

16:56.983 --> 16:58.350
(chuckles)                      

16:58.418 --> 17:00.886
And besides, Ma knows I'm out   
with the boys tonight, you know.

17:00.954 --> 17:03.222
If I don't come home            
with a little glow on,          

17:03.289 --> 17:05.190
she'll tease me                 
till I cry.                     

17:07.961 --> 17:10.496
            All right, I call.  

17:10.563 --> 17:12.564
          I got you this time,  
    fellas, read 'em and weep,  

17:12.632 --> 17:13.832
            Aces over tens.     

17:14.034 --> 17:15.367
          (all groan)           

17:15.502 --> 17:16.435
FRASIER:                        
Ay, yi-yi.                      

17:16.502 --> 17:17.803
WOODY:                          
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Sam,         

17:17.904 --> 17:21.940
 uh, I got a couple of pairs--  
    eights and threes.          

17:22.008 --> 17:26.478
          Woody, aces and tens  
    beat eights and threes.     

17:26.579 --> 17:29.014
      Oh, I'm sorry,            
  here's one more three.        

17:29.082 --> 17:31.750
     Full house-- (screams)     

17:33.219 --> 17:34.386
              (laughing)        

17:34.454 --> 17:35.954
              I know            
    I'm the only one laughing,  

17:36.056 --> 17:38.123
        but believe me,         
    it's really funny.          

17:40.193 --> 17:42.494
Woody, your obnoxious,          
gloating behavior               

17:42.562 --> 17:44.463
is not making you               
any friends.                    

17:44.564 --> 17:47.466
Well, boo-hoo, Dr. Crane,       
     I can <i>buy</i> new friends.     

17:47.534 --> 17:50.436
      All right, deal the cards,
  come on, let's deal the cards.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.603
Wait a minute.                  

17:51.671 --> 17:54.773
I was looking for the queen     
of spades here and...           

17:54.841 --> 17:56.642
there is no queen of spades     
in this deck.                   

17:56.710 --> 17:57.910
I'm gonna count                 
these cards.                    
                     Go ahead.  

17:57.977 --> 18:00.546
                  Hey, guys, is 
                 it me or is... 

18:00.613 --> 18:04.049
                    (laughing): 
      ...or is this beer great? 

18:04.117 --> 18:06.485
    Boy, well, you know, I--    

18:06.553 --> 18:08.520
      maybe I should just       
      hold off here, I...       

18:08.588 --> 18:11.023
          I, for one, am getting
            a little buzz on,   

18:11.091 --> 18:12.791
        I'm here to tell you.   

18:12.859 --> 18:14.026
         Hey, uh, guys,         

18:14.094 --> 18:15.260
                         listen.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.329
I-I love you guys.              

18:17.397 --> 18:20.299
          I told you hours ago--
                 don't touch me.

18:22.836 --> 18:25.237
As I suspected, there are       
only 51 cards in this deck.     

18:25.305 --> 18:26.305
            Oh, for cryin'...   

18:26.373 --> 18:27.539
All right, let's look           
for the other one.              

18:27.607 --> 18:28.707
        Yeah, you bet we're     
             gonna look for it  

18:28.775 --> 18:29.842
            and we're gonna     
                 find it, too,  

18:29.943 --> 18:32.011
            or my name is not   
             Clifford C. Clavin.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.312
     Come on, take it easy.     

18:33.380 --> 18:34.947
 You've had a little too much,  
          haven't you?          

18:35.015 --> 18:36.148
                Well, you relax,
                      buddy boy.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.583
                    One of us   
                     is cheating

18:37.650 --> 18:39.852
            and one of us is not
      getting out of here alive.

18:39.953 --> 18:43.122
                Here it is, it's
            under Sammy's chair.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.791
    Oh, Sammy, Sammy, look...   

18:45.859 --> 18:48.193
        if you needed the money,
     why didn't you just ask me?

18:50.130 --> 18:51.296
    No one's accusing anyone    
          of cheating.          

18:51.364 --> 18:52.731
          We just have          
    to replay the last hand.    

18:52.799 --> 18:53.966
            Go ahead            
 and deal them out there, Phil. 

18:55.969 --> 18:57.336
            You want            
  to hurry it up there, Phil?   

18:57.404 --> 18:59.705
 I got to get up early and pack 
  for my weekend in Nantucket.  

18:59.773 --> 19:01.206
                Hmm, a little   
             pleasure trip, huh?

19:01.274 --> 19:05.344
      No, Lilith's coming.      

19:05.412 --> 19:07.546
Five-card showdown,             
fellas.                         

19:07.614 --> 19:08.847
                    All right.  

19:10.717 --> 19:11.750
FRASIER:                        
Uh, check.                      

19:11.818 --> 19:13.118
                Uh, check.      

19:13.286 --> 19:15.854
              Ah!               

19:15.922 --> 19:17.589
            Oh, man, I'm out.   
 I'm out.                       

19:17.657 --> 19:20.192
NORM:                           
Oh, Woody,                      
for crying out loud.            

19:20.260 --> 19:22.061
        I'll call.              

19:22.128 --> 19:24.063
          Three aces.           

19:24.164 --> 19:25.731
      (laughing)                

19:25.799 --> 19:28.200
  Read 'em and weep there,      
         buddy boy.             

19:29.903 --> 19:33.472
        Cliff, y-you got five   
          unmatched cards there.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.074
                          CLIFF:
                That's right.   

19:35.141 --> 19:37.242
 And, uh, you guys probably     
 thought I was bluffing, huh?   

19:37.310 --> 19:39.478
         Come to Papa.          

19:47.387 --> 19:50.889
        (yawning):              
            Oh, boy.            

19:50.957 --> 19:54.360
          I am so glad          
this night is almost over.      

19:54.427 --> 19:57.930
I am just wiped out.            

19:57.997 --> 20:00.199
    You know, Rebecca, you've   
     been through a lot tonight.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.067
          I was thinking maybe I
        took advantage of you   

20:02.135 --> 20:03.535
                    when I asked
                        you out.

20:03.603 --> 20:07.006
     Ever since my wife left me,
     I've been sort of desperate

20:07.073 --> 20:09.375
    for female companionship,   
            you know.           

20:09.442 --> 20:10.943
                    I always say
                the wrong thing.

20:11.011 --> 20:12.845
                So what it boils
            down to is this--   

20:12.912 --> 20:17.383
  if, if, if you'd rather not go
    out with me, I'd understand.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.717
      That's sweet, Paul.       

20:20.487 --> 20:22.788
        I'd be delighted        
  to go out with you tonight.   

20:22.856 --> 20:25.457
          Bring your toothbrush.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.726
            (groans)            

20:27.794 --> 20:29.261
        Everything okay?        

20:29.329 --> 20:31.864
 Would you quit coming in here  
    every five seconds          

20:31.931 --> 20:33.766
         and asking me          
     if everything's okay?      

20:33.833 --> 20:35.034
    What is it going to take    

20:35.101 --> 20:37.436
    before you believe          
 that everything is just fine?  

20:37.504 --> 20:38.671
(door opens)                    

20:38.738 --> 20:39.738
State Liquor Board.             

20:39.806 --> 20:41.440
Nobody move,                    
this is a raid.                 

20:41.508 --> 20:42.975
                 What the hell's
                  going on here?

20:43.043 --> 20:44.410
I'll handle this,               
I'm the manager.                

20:44.477 --> 20:46.945
    We understand you're serving
  liquor here without a license.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.113
              Who owns this bar?

20:48.181 --> 20:50.849
He does.                        

20:50.917 --> 20:52.951
                 What the hell's
                  going on here?

20:53.019 --> 20:54.620
        Mercy me.               

20:54.688 --> 20:56.555
     What is going on here?     

20:56.623 --> 20:57.556
            A raid?             

20:57.624 --> 20:59.992
        Say it isn't so.        

21:00.060 --> 21:02.227
                    Will someone
                  please tell me

21:02.295 --> 21:04.263
                what the hell is
        going on around here?   

21:04.330 --> 21:06.165
            I'll tell you, Sam. 

21:06.232 --> 21:07.533
     A little vent told me      

21:07.600 --> 21:10.302
        your manager let        
  your liquor license expire.   

21:10.370 --> 21:12.571
     Yes, but w-we did not serve
         one drop of liquor here

21:12.639 --> 21:13.739
         all night long,        

21:13.807 --> 21:16.208
     a-a-and you guys can check 
          any glass here.       

21:18.912 --> 21:20.079
    It's clean.                 

21:20.146 --> 21:21.180
                        REBECCA:
                        You see?

21:21.247 --> 21:22.781
        I saved the day.        

21:22.849 --> 21:24.783
You saved the day?!             

21:24.851 --> 21:26.418
You wouldn't have had           
to save the day                 

21:26.486 --> 21:28.654
if you hadn't have screwed it up
      in the first place.       

21:28.722 --> 21:30.189
Come on, what were              
you thinking?                   

21:30.256 --> 21:31.256
How could you do that?          

21:31.324 --> 21:32.658
How could you forget            
something like that?            

21:32.726 --> 21:34.526
            You know            
that could have cost me my bar? 

21:34.594 --> 21:36.362
  I mean, what have you got--   
      rocks in your head?       

21:36.429 --> 21:37.863
             You know, I mean, I
          did mail the thing in.

21:37.931 --> 21:39.365
                  It's just that
                it came back.   

21:39.432 --> 21:41.033
          I think there was just
 something wrong with the stamp.

21:41.101 --> 21:43.502
There's nothing wrong           
with the stamp, you moron.      

21:43.570 --> 21:44.837
  It's for 25 cents.            

21:44.904 --> 21:46.505
  I put it on myself.           

21:46.573 --> 21:47.606
AGENT:                          
Postage is                      

21:47.674 --> 21:49.274
            29 cents.           

21:49.342 --> 21:52.144
              Oh.               

21:52.212 --> 21:53.779
     Well, I'm out of here.     

21:53.847 --> 21:56.115
     Why don't you go ahead     
    and, uh, close up?          

21:56.182 --> 21:57.349
              After all, you    
             are the manager.   

21:57.417 --> 21:58.851
                        REBECCA:
                     No, hold it
                    a second.   

21:58.918 --> 22:01.186
You're the one that screwed up. 

22:01.254 --> 22:02.821
         I-I'm the one          
      that saved this bar.      

22:02.889 --> 22:04.790
          So, I mean,           
     who is the moron now?      

22:04.858 --> 22:07.726
          You're the one who put
        the stamp on this letter

22:07.794 --> 22:10.229
while I've been scrambling      
    around this bar tonight     

22:10.296 --> 22:13.565
    trying to save it           
without breaking one law.       

22:13.633 --> 22:17.503
That's right, I did that--      
    me, Rebecca, the moron.     

22:17.570 --> 22:20.072
                        REBECCA:
          Well, things are going
          to change around here.

22:20.140 --> 22:23.575
From now on, I want a little    
respect around this place.      

22:23.643 --> 22:24.810
         You got that?          

22:24.878 --> 22:26.412
                      All right.

22:26.479 --> 22:30.683
Because, from this day forward, 
  I will hold my head up high,  

22:30.750 --> 22:33.218
      because I am Rebecca Howe.

22:33.286 --> 22:36.488
  I am the manager of Cheers.   

22:43.630 --> 22:46.465
        That's, that's why we   
        always keep the flap up.
