Two and a Half Men...

00:02.379 --> 00:03.530
I'm talking about making

00:03.555 --> 00:05.335
a long-term commitment
to each other.

00:05.336 --> 00:06.502
You mean like marriage?

00:06.504 --> 00:07.969
I just don't understand
why we can't

00:07.971 --> 00:09.134
keep things the way they are.

00:09.136 --> 00:10.698
You mean living day-to-day,

00:10.700 --> 00:12.066
never knowing what kind of
future you have

00:12.068 --> 00:13.565
with the person you've
been in a relationship with

00:13.567 --> 00:15.104
the past three years?

00:15.106 --> 00:18.340
Okay, I-I prefer to think of it
as cherishing each day--

00:18.342 --> 00:21.275
nay, each moment--
with the woman I love

00:21.277 --> 00:22.675
because it-it could
all disappear

00:22.677 --> 00:24.778
in-in the blink of an eye.

00:24.780 --> 00:27.050
You mean like this?

00:27.052 --> 00:28.249
How was your day?

00:28.274 --> 00:30.023
I'm pretty sure
Lyndsey and I broke up.

00:30.024 --> 00:31.858
I really like Lyndsey.
I thought she was great.

00:31.860 --> 00:33.192
She is great.

00:33.194 --> 00:34.660
But I'm not gonna be bullied
into spending the rest

00:34.662 --> 00:36.195
of my life with somebody
just 'cause they're great.

00:37.031 --> 00:39.701
Alan.
We need to talk.

00:39.703 --> 00:40.535
Go ahead.

00:40.537 --> 00:42.170
I-I want to be with you forever.

00:42.172 --> 00:45.239
That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

00:45.241 --> 00:46.340
I love you, Lyndsey,

00:46.342 --> 00:49.479
and as soon as I can
save enough money,

00:49.481 --> 00:51.147
I'm gonna...

00:51.149 --> 00:53.017
put a deposit down
on an engagement ring.

00:53.019 --> 00:55.987
You don't have to
buy me some dumb ring.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.256
That's all I ever
wanted to hear.

01:01.592 --> 01:03.393
(Skype chimes)

01:03.395 --> 01:04.626
Oh! Oh, hey, Jake.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.931
Hey, Dad.
What's going on?

01:06.933 --> 01:08.699
Oh, I've got good news.
I've got a girlfriend.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.501
Oh, oh, that's great.

01:10.503 --> 01:11.702
And it gets better.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.403
She gave me the clap.

01:14.706 --> 01:16.240
Wait, wait, how's that better?

01:16.242 --> 01:19.311
It's a sexually transmitted
disease, Dad.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.151
Sexually transmitted.

01:24.153 --> 01:26.821
<i>Disease.</i>

01:26.823 --> 01:29.124
Yeah. So you get it.

01:29.126 --> 01:31.594
And now everybody knows
that I'm getting it.

01:31.596 --> 01:34.163
Wait.
Wait, y-you're telling people?

01:34.165 --> 01:37.368
No, I don't have to,
'cause I scream when I pee.

01:39.404 --> 01:41.607
I'm literally speechless, Jake.

01:41.609 --> 01:43.543
Hey, Walden!

01:43.545 --> 01:45.144
Oh, hey, Jake.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.512
I got the clap!

01:49.349 --> 01:53.452
Uh... congratulations.

01:53.454 --> 01:55.186
Thanks, man.

01:55.188 --> 01:57.455
All right, gotta run, Dad.
I'll talk to you later.

01:57.457 --> 02:00.057
I'm going to SeaWorld with my
girlfriend and her three kids.

02:01.393 --> 02:04.194
It's too bad antibiotics
can't cure stupidity.

02:04.196 --> 02:07.464
Hey, that's my son you're...
eh, you're right.

02:09.533 --> 02:10.533
(computer chimes)

02:10.536 --> 02:11.635
Huh.

02:11.637 --> 02:12.603
What?

02:12.605 --> 02:15.439
I just got an e-mail
from my ex-wife.

02:15.441 --> 02:17.474
She wants to meet me for coffee.

02:17.476 --> 02:18.442
Judith?

02:18.444 --> 02:20.276
Oh, no, no, m-my second wife.

02:20.278 --> 02:22.812
You got two women to marry you?

02:22.814 --> 02:24.013
Yeah.

02:24.015 --> 02:27.150
I had to get the taste
of Judith out of my mouth.

02:27.152 --> 02:30.121
How come you never told me
about the second one?

02:30.123 --> 02:31.455
Ah, there wasn't much to tell.

02:31.457 --> 02:32.757
I mean, we got married in Vegas,

02:32.759 --> 02:34.559
won a half a million
dollar jackpot,

02:34.561 --> 02:36.228
she dumped me, took the money,

02:36.230 --> 02:38.197
and moved to New York
and became a TV star.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.566
This might be the first
interesting story

02:40.568 --> 02:42.168
you've ever told.

02:43.270 --> 02:44.504
Was she really a TV star?

02:44.506 --> 02:46.706
Yeah, she's on that
cop show <i>Stiffs.</i>

02:46.708 --> 02:49.542
"If you're not
one of the suspects,

02:49.544 --> 02:50.911
you're one of the Stiffs."

02:52.013 --> 02:53.580
I love that show.

02:53.582 --> 02:55.115
Who does she play?

02:55.117 --> 02:56.450
Detective Jane Risotto.

02:56.452 --> 02:59.186
Wait a minute!

03:00.389 --> 03:02.791
You were married to
tough-talkin', smooth-walkin',

03:02.793 --> 03:04.459
pistol-packin' Jane Risotto?

03:04.461 --> 03:06.028
Guilty.

03:06.030 --> 03:08.597
Guilty of being with
the hottest woman on Earth.

03:08.599 --> 03:09.364
I-I know.

03:09.366 --> 03:10.666
Hold on...

03:10.668 --> 03:11.667
Wait, her?

03:11.669 --> 03:12.802
Yes.

03:12.804 --> 03:14.537
You?

03:14.539 --> 03:16.506
Yes.

03:16.508 --> 03:18.408
No...

03:18.410 --> 03:20.710
Yes.
No!

03:20.712 --> 03:23.212
And you wonder why I didn't
tell you about this.

03:25.549 --> 03:26.850
No!

03:26.852 --> 03:28.151
ALAN:
Yes!

03:29.854 --> 03:32.423
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:07.662 --> 04:09.261
Oh, um...

04:09.263 --> 04:11.030
Kandi, over here.

04:11.032 --> 04:12.498
Alan.
(chuckles)

04:12.500 --> 04:15.100
Look at you.
You look terrific.

04:15.102 --> 04:16.267
Oh, thank you.

04:16.269 --> 04:17.569
And you look...
Wow.

04:17.571 --> 04:19.071
(clears throat)

04:19.072 --> 04:21.072
That-that dress fits you
like a...

04:21.074 --> 04:22.874
spray-on tan.

04:23.742 --> 04:25.843
It's so good to see you.

04:25.845 --> 04:28.279
Well, you, too. So, uh,
what are you doing here?

04:28.281 --> 04:31.049
Meeting you for coffee. Duh.

04:31.051 --> 04:34.252
Uh, n-no, I meant what are
you doing here in L.A.?

04:34.254 --> 04:36.753
Oh. I'm in the new
James Cameron movie.

04:36.778 --> 04:37.322
Oh!

04:37.323 --> 04:38.722
I'm gonna be in 3-D.

04:38.724 --> 04:41.091
You'll certainly pop
right off the screen.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.261
Pop, pop.

04:44.263 --> 04:45.429
Thanks.

04:45.431 --> 04:47.564
So, what's up with you?
How's Jake?

04:47.566 --> 04:49.567
Oh, good. Uh, he's in the army.

04:49.569 --> 04:51.903
Wow!
(chuckling): Yeah.

04:51.905 --> 04:53.605
Which one?

04:54.440 --> 04:56.575
Um... ours.

04:56.577 --> 04:59.044
Oh, phew.

04:59.046 --> 05:01.480
So, look at you,
Little Miss Hollywood.

05:01.482 --> 05:04.283
Oh, please,
I haven't changed at all.

05:04.285 --> 05:07.920
I'd like a nonfat, decaf latte
with just a whisper of foam.

05:07.922 --> 05:10.456
Um, Kandi, he doesn't work here.

05:11.291 --> 05:13.392
Is that a problem?

05:13.394 --> 05:14.459
Nope.

05:17.330 --> 05:20.265
So, did you ever get remarried?

05:20.267 --> 05:23.501
Oh, oh, no, but, uh... but I do
have a lovely girlfriend.

05:23.503 --> 05:25.070
Oh...

05:25.072 --> 05:26.405
good for you.

05:26.407 --> 05:29.374
Thanks. So, how about you?
You seeing anyone?

05:29.376 --> 05:34.946
No. Most guys just want a
piece of Detective Jane Risotto.

05:34.948 --> 05:38.216
Well, as pieces go,
that's a good one.

05:38.218 --> 05:39.384
Thanks.

05:39.386 --> 05:41.086
I never told you this,

05:41.088 --> 05:43.455
but you're the best lover
I ever had.

05:43.457 --> 05:46.859
Oh, oh, geez, uh...
I don't know what to say.

05:46.861 --> 05:49.829
Uh, but, you know, I certainly
gave it 110% every time.

05:49.831 --> 05:50.963
Mmm.

05:50.965 --> 05:52.397
Wow.

05:52.399 --> 05:55.467
Imagine if you had given it
your all.

05:58.472 --> 06:00.573
I'm sorry,
you're in a relationship.

06:00.575 --> 06:02.575
We shouldn't even be talking
about this stuff.

06:02.577 --> 06:04.077
That's right.
It's just not appropriate.

06:04.079 --> 06:07.947
So, um... so, didn't you date
Derek Jeter for a while?

06:07.949 --> 06:09.149
I did.

06:09.151 --> 06:11.351
Huh.

06:14.655 --> 06:16.856
(knocking)

06:18.559 --> 06:19.659
Hi.

06:19.661 --> 06:21.561
Hi! What are you doing here?

06:21.563 --> 06:22.829
Well, something weird
just happened,

06:22.831 --> 06:24.731
and I wanted to talk
to you about it.

06:24.733 --> 06:25.899
You okay?

06:25.901 --> 06:27.267
Oh, oh, yeah, everything's fine.

06:27.269 --> 06:28.368
It's just, uh...

06:28.370 --> 06:31.038
Uh, well, come here,
sit down.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.473
What's going on?

06:32.475 --> 06:34.808
Uh, well, okay,
here's the deal. I...

06:34.810 --> 06:38.479
I just... met my ex-wife
for coffee and she...

06:38.481 --> 06:40.281
got a little flirtatious
with me,

06:40.283 --> 06:41.983
and it kind of freaked me out.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.552
Wait, Judith got
flirtatious with you?

06:44.554 --> 06:46.020
Oh, oh, no, it wasn't Judith.

06:46.022 --> 06:47.489
It was the hot one?

06:47.491 --> 06:51.493
Okay, I don't think Judith would
appreciate that, but, uh...

06:51.495 --> 06:54.296
but, yes, i-it was
the-the hot one.

06:54.298 --> 06:56.398
What do you mean
she was flirtatious?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.133
Oh, oh, the details
are unimportant.

06:58.135 --> 07:00.535
I mean, she said I was
better in bed than Derek Jeter,

07:00.537 --> 07:02.037
but whatever, um...

07:02.039 --> 07:03.905
Wait a second, you want me
to believe

07:03.907 --> 07:06.441
that one of the sexiest women
in the world hit on you

07:06.443 --> 07:07.643
and you turned her down?

07:07.645 --> 07:08.944
Well, yes, yes, I-I did.

07:08.946 --> 07:11.614
I-I told Kandi that I am
in a committed relationship

07:11.616 --> 07:13.849
with a woman
that I-I truly love,

07:13.851 --> 07:15.584
and-and I just wanted
to tell you

07:15.586 --> 07:17.753
because I don't want us
to have any secrets.

07:17.755 --> 07:19.288
Really?

07:19.290 --> 07:22.525
Yeah. I don't need a young,
rich, gorgeous movie star

07:22.527 --> 07:24.727
with flawless skin
and a great body.

07:24.729 --> 07:26.095
I have you.

07:28.932 --> 07:32.067
Okay, l-let me try that again.

07:32.069 --> 07:34.270
Um...

07:35.639 --> 07:37.406
(footfalls approaching)

07:38.575 --> 07:40.943
Oh, hey, you should take
tomorrow off.

07:40.945 --> 07:41.778
Why?

07:41.780 --> 07:42.912
It's your birthday.

07:42.914 --> 07:44.347
Nobody should have to work
on their birthday.

07:44.349 --> 07:46.416
Who the hell told you
it was my birthday?

07:46.418 --> 07:49.086
You did, when we put you
on my company health plan.

07:49.088 --> 07:52.255
Damn it, I should've just lived
with that hernia.

07:52.257 --> 07:55.192
Come on, birthdays
are terrific. It's...

07:55.194 --> 07:58.528
all your loved ones
celebrating how great you are.

07:58.530 --> 08:01.665
It's like Christmas, except
you're the savior of the world.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.600
Sounds good,

08:03.602 --> 08:06.937
but all my loved ones are
in jail, rehab, or dead.

08:06.939 --> 08:09.674
I can't think of anything
I'm less interested in

08:09.676 --> 08:11.142
than my birthday.

08:11.144 --> 08:12.910
Boy, do I have
a story for you.

08:12.912 --> 08:14.746
I stand corrected.

08:16.515 --> 08:17.482
What's going on?

08:17.484 --> 08:18.983
So, I go meet Kandi for coffee.

08:18.985 --> 08:21.720
Yeah.
It turns out she wants me.

08:21.722 --> 08:22.921
No.
Yeah.

08:22.923 --> 08:24.323
No!
Oh, yeah.

08:24.325 --> 08:25.124
So did you?

08:25.126 --> 08:26.124
No.
No?!

08:26.126 --> 08:27.759
Yes!

08:27.761 --> 08:29.161
Uh, hold on, I'm lost.

08:29.163 --> 08:30.762
So, when I tell Lyndsey

08:30.764 --> 08:33.232
that I turned down
Kandi because of her,

08:33.234 --> 08:35.101
Lyndsey bangs my brains out.

08:35.102 --> 08:36.736
In the middle
of the day.

08:36.738 --> 08:38.854
She could see everything
and she kept going.

08:39.784 --> 08:40.640
No!

08:40.642 --> 08:42.876
Yes! But let's not get caught
in this loop again.

08:42.878 --> 08:44.077
I-I mean, all my life,

08:44.078 --> 08:46.246
I've had to lie to women
to have fantastic sex.

08:46.248 --> 08:48.448
Turns out, all I had
to do was be honest.

08:48.450 --> 08:50.251
It's almost ridiculous
in its simplicity.

08:50.276 --> 08:51.086
Huh.

08:51.087 --> 08:53.455
From now on, I'm just gonna
be totally honest with women.

08:53.555 --> 08:55.689
Well, until they catch on
to that scam.

08:55.691 --> 08:58.925
Exactly. Then it's back
