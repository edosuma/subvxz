00:00.000 --> 00:03.635
Previously,

00:03.637 --> 00:04.503
on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

00:04.505 --> 00:06.572
<i>You'll transform these gallant</i>

00:06.574 --> 00:10.576
<i>grooms into blushing brides.</i>

00:10.578 --> 00:12.311
<i> I'm not a seamstress.</i>

00:12.313 --> 00:13.212
<i>I'm not cinderella.</i>

00:13.214 --> 00:14.380
<i>I don't have mice to come help</i>

00:14.382 --> 00:16.682
<i>me make this damn garment.</i>

00:16.684 --> 00:23.889
<i> I now pronounce you married.</i>
<i>[Cheers and applause]</i>
<i> I didn't get the goth thing.</i>

00:23.891 --> 00:30.629
<i>Your outfit seemed a little</i>
<i>cocktail party.</i>
<i> The face looks metallic.</i>

00:30.631 --> 00:35.901
<i> Bianca Del Rio, you are the</i>
<i>winner of this week's main</i>
<i>challenge.</i>

00:35.903 --> 00:43.042
<i>Adore Delano, shante, you stay.</i>
<i>Joslyn Fox, sashay away.</i>

00:43.044 --> 00:49.548
<i> Top five!</i>

00:49.550 --> 00:50.883
<i> Fabulous five.</i>

00:50.885 --> 00:52.217
<i>[Laughter]</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:53.852
<i> Let's see what josy says.</i>

00:53.854 --> 00:56.622
<i> Can we all just do a foxy</i>
<i>signoff...</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

00:56.624 --> 00:58.624
<i> Oh.</i>
<i> Together?</i>
<i> Boop, boop.</i>

00:58.626 --> 01:01.360
<i> Mew, mew.</i>
<i> Boop, boop.</i>
<i> Keep it foxy.</i>

01:01.362 --> 01:05.464
<i> Congratulations to you, young</i>
<i>lady.</i>
<i> I'm the new Trinity!</i>

01:05.466 --> 01:08.634
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> You turned out that lip sync,</i>
<i>even though when you took off</i>

01:08.636 --> 01:11.603
<i>your shoes, you looked a little</i>
<i>like the girl from</i> <i>the grudge.</i>
<i> Yeah, I did.</i>

01:11.605 --> 01:15.307
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>I kind of hit a slump.</i>
<i>I've been in the bottom two</i>

01:15.309 --> 01:20.279
<i>twice, but I know that I'm not</i>
<i>gonna be in the bottom two</i>
<i>again, 'cause that feeling sucks</i>

01:20.281 --> 01:25.150
<i>donkey cock.</i>
<i> Congratulations, Bianca.</i>
<i> Thank you, my love.</i>

01:25.152 --> 01:30.189
<i>I will send all of you a</i>
<i>postcard from Hawaii, 'cause</i>
<i>remember, you're my sisters.</i>

01:30.191 --> 01:32.591
<i> Bianca is so comfortable</i>

01:32.593 --> 01:33.892
<i>right now, she's practically</i>

01:33.894 --> 01:35.461
<i>just, like, taking a nap on the</i>

01:35.463 --> 01:36.261
<i>couch.</i>

01:36.263 --> 01:40.799
<i>The last time I got cocky about</i>
<i>my position, I wound up in the</i>
<i>bottom two.</i>

01:40.801 --> 01:46.805
<i> I noticed a little Darienne</i>
<i>lake with the potty mouth when</i>
<i>she walked back from being safe.</i>

01:46.807 --> 01:49.575
<i> I'm mad as hell that I'm in</i>
<i>the bottom three.</i>

01:49.577 --> 01:50.742
<i>Did I think I outperformed</i>

01:50.744 --> 01:51.610
<i>Courtney in that challenge?</i>

01:51.612 --> 01:52.711
<i>Yes.</i>

01:52.713 --> 01:57.082
<i>I blame it on that goddamn</i>
<i>doogie howser and his little,</i>
<i>you know, val kilmer knockoff</i>

01:57.084 --> 01:59.384
<i>boyfriend.</i>
<i> Oh!</i>
<i> He's a doctor.</i>

01:59.386 --> 02:04.189
<i>Your daughter should be so</i>
<i>lucky.</i>
<i>Darienne's not quite listening</i>

02:04.191 --> 02:08.794
<i>to the judges, or Ru, or anyone,</i>
<i>for that matter.</i>
<i>She always thinks she does</i>

02:08.796 --> 02:12.397
<i>better than she does.</i>
<i>She's like those friends that go</i>
<i>out with you, and they're like,</i>

02:12.399 --> 02:15.667
<i>"oh, that man's looking at me."</i>
<i>I'm like, "no, he's just looking</i>
<i>at your fucking booger on your</i>

02:15.669 --> 02:21.573
<i>nose, bitch."</i>
<i>That's called delusion, and that</i>
<i>is gonna hurt her.</i>

02:21.575 --> 02:27.913
<i>  RuPaul's Drag Race </i>
<i> the winner of</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> receives

02:27.915 --> 02:34.653
a sickening supply of
Colorevolution cosmetics and a
cash prize of $100,000.

02:34.655 --> 02:41.226
With extra special guest judges
khloe Kardashian and Bob mackie!
RuPaul's Drag Race

02:41.228 --> 02:43.462
best woman win

02:43.464 --> 02:45.964
[tires screeching]

02:45.966 --> 02:54.907
[Laughter]
Top five.
We are so close to the top

02:54.909 --> 02:59.011
three, and it's kind of hard to
know what's gonna happen because
it feels like there might be two

02:59.013 --> 03:03.448
people eliminated next, or maybe
they're just gonna bring in
another 14 girls and start over

03:03.450 --> 03:07.986
again.
After, like, the first day of
meeting everybody, I wrote down

03:07.988 --> 03:11.323
in a book--I have proof that I
picked us as the top five.
Seriously?

03:11.325 --> 03:14.259
You are such a liar.
I swear to God.
You are so full of shit.

03:14.261 --> 03:17.930
Well, it was the best of a
bad bunch, really, wasn't it?
[Laughs]

03:17.932 --> 03:21.533
You are starting some shit.
[Alarm blares]
[Gasps] Saved by the bell.

03:21.535 --> 03:29.708
Ooh, girl!
My precious gems, to experience
the sweet smell of success, you

03:29.710 --> 03:35.180
need to be the jewel in my
crown.
Shine bright like a diamond, or

03:35.182 --> 03:40.152
you can just pull my ring
finger.
[Laughs]

03:40.154 --> 03:44.223
Hello, hello, hello.
All: Hi.
Now, in the heat of

03:44.225 --> 03:49.661
competition, a lot of
unexpressed feelings can get
bottled up.

03:49.663 --> 03:55.801
So for today's mini challenge,
I want to do some therapeutic
role playing, and we're gonna

03:55.803 --> 04:00.572
do it...
With puppets.
[Laughter]

04:00.574 --> 04:06.912
Because everybody loves puppets!
Ah!
Now, I wonder who's behind

04:06.914 --> 04:11.783
that wall.
Well, "glory hole-elujah."
It's the scruff pit crew.

04:11.785 --> 04:16.755
All: Woof, woof, woof, woof.
First up, Adore.

04:16.757 --> 04:21.360
Who'd you get?
De LA.
Yay!

04:21.362 --> 04:24.830
Yay!
My eyebrows have never looked
like that.

04:24.832 --> 04:30.869
Next up, Bianca.
I have Adore.
Adore.

04:30.871 --> 04:36.308
Oh, shit.
Next up, Darienne Lake.
Hee hee hee hee.

04:36.310 --> 04:41.013
Ooh.
[Gasps] I got Courtney Act.
[Laughter]

04:41.015 --> 04:45.417
Next up, de LA.
Who'd you pick?
It's Bianca Del Rio.

04:45.419 --> 04:48.220
[Laughter]
Oh!
Ah.

04:48.222 --> 04:51.857
[Laughter]
All right, Courtney, go on
over.

04:51.859 --> 04:57.529
I hope the hole's big enough.
[Laughs]
It's Darienne Lake!

04:57.531 --> 05:03.902
[Laughter]
All right, girls, on your
mark, get set, drag it up.

05:03.904 --> 05:10.375
Oh.
Ee!
Bianca, you giving it a nice

05:10.377 --> 05:14.379
hog body?
[Laughs] Oh, you think?
You are so evil.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.115
Do you have Courtney's
costume together? [Laughs]
I was hoping that I could get

05:17.117 --> 05:20.919
somebody else to make it for me.
[Gasps] Ooh.
Ooh.

05:20.921 --> 05:24.589
It's interesting that Bianca,
who could have taken any of us
down probably, got the

05:24.591 --> 05:28.827
absolutely easiest to puppet.
I did get the easy one.
Oh, shut up!

05:28.829 --> 05:31.997
What is that supposed to mean?
It's nothing bad.
You're just basically already a

05:31.999 --> 05:34.666
puppet.
Oh!
That is so rude!

05:34.668 --> 05:39.004
No, but you're really easy to
imitate, whereas Bianca is hard
to imitate because I don't

05:39.006 --> 05:42.174
listen to her.
[Laughs]
[Laughs]

05:42.176 --> 05:48.580
Oh, my God!
All right, let the bitch-fest
begin.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.648
Hi, Ben de LA creme.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.816
How are you?

05:50.818 --> 05:52.884
"Honestly, like, I'm really

05:52.886 --> 05:53.652
good."

05:53.654 --> 05:58.123
[Laughter]
"It's just I don't understand
why the judges say that my

05:58.125 --> 06:02.394
outfits look costume-y."
[Laughter]
So what do you use to cover

06:02.396 --> 06:05.997
your eyebrows?
"Oatmeal."
[Laughter]

06:05.999 --> 06:10.168
Oh, funny.
I--[Laughs]
I don't know if my eyebrows are

06:10.170 --> 06:15.006
really that oatmeal-y.
"I'll teach you how to cover
up your hog body if you help me

06:15.008 --> 06:17.242
blend."
Okay.
Yeah, I swear, you're amazing

06:17.244 --> 06:21.346
and perfect.
"Thank you."
[Laughter]

06:21.348 --> 06:22.848
Adore, I'm really nervous

06:22.850 --> 06:24.282
because I think you can see

06:24.284 --> 06:25.917
your dirty pantyhose.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.920
[Laughs]
"Party fuck."
[Laughter]

06:28.922 --> 06:33.058
I do have really dirty
tights.
They smell like feet.

06:33.060 --> 06:38.930
I'm too punk to wash my tights.
[Laughs]
"I feel so cool, cool, cool."

06:38.932 --> 06:41.967
[Laughter]
"I'm a libra."
[Laughter]

06:41.969 --> 06:46.405
Wow, Courtney, I love your

06:46.407 --> 06:47.305
dress.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.840
"Thank you, dazzle.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.142
I'd love to compliment you on

06:50.144 --> 06:51.076
something, but everything you

06:51.078 --> 06:52.677
wear is so damn hideous."

06:52.679 --> 06:56.114
[Laughs]
"It's not that your clothes
are ugly.

06:56.116 --> 07:02.320
It's just you're misshapen."
[Laughter]
Okay.

07:02.322 --> 07:05.724
Wow, Courtney.
You could probably glue down
that lace front there.

07:05.726 --> 07:09.060
Oh, no, that's just your skin
that's wrinkled.
"Well, I'm the oldest living

07:09.062 --> 07:13.698
twink in history."
[Laughter]
Well, you got that twink body.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.501
You could probably do a couple
of squats to tighten up that
ass.

07:16.503 --> 07:21.273
[Laughs]
"You look like a wallaby."
[Laughter]

07:21.275 --> 07:22.707
Hi, Darienne, how are you?

07:22.709 --> 07:24.309
"Hi, I'm Darienne Lake!"

07:24.311 --> 07:28.914
So, Darienne, tell me, have
you had a fun time on <i>RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race?</i>

07:28.916 --> 07:32.050
<i>"I've had a great time,</i>
<i>Courtney."</i>
<i>What's been your least favorite</i>

07:32.052 --> 07:36.421
<i>part?</i>
<i>"Mm, probably the guest judges."</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

07:36.423 --> 07:39.758
<i>"Neil Patrick Harris hates me."</i>
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>And what about his boyfriend?</i>

07:39.760 --> 07:47.399
<i>"I told him he could use $1.50</i>
<i>to go ride the bus."</i>
<i>I'm finding it really hard to</i>

07:47.401 --> 07:51.403
<i>make you funny, Darienne.</i>
<i>It's just like real life.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

07:51.405 --> 07:54.706
<i>"I'm gonna go check the Internet</i>
<i>for some jokes.</i>
<i>I don't have any wi-fi here, so</i>

07:54.708 --> 07:59.277
<i>I'm finding it very difficult to</i>
<i>be funny."</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

07:59.279 --> 08:00.345
<i> Hi there, Bianca.</i>

08:00.347 --> 08:01.680
<i>How are you doing today?</i>

08:01.682 --> 08:02.347
<i>"Terrible!</i>

08:02.349 --> 08:03.281
<i>These people are a bunch of</i>

08:03.283 --> 08:03.982
<i>assholes!"</i>

08:03.984 --> 08:07.619
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>Oh, well, Bianca, what a thing</i>
<i>to say.</i>

08:07.621 --> 08:11.656
<i>"Baloney!"</i>
<i>Now, Bianca, your dress looks</i>
<i>gorgeous today.</i>

08:11.658 --> 08:15.527
<i>"Well, thank goodness, because</i>
<i>i have 50 of the same dress in</i>
<i>different fabrics."</i>

08:15.529 --> 08:19.431
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>Bianca, tell me a little bit</i>
<i>about how you're feeling in this</i>

08:19.433 --> 08:22.501
<i>competition.</i>
<i>"All these people are idiots and</i>
<i>assholes!</i>

08:22.503 --> 08:26.771
<i>Adore's an idiot!</i>
<i>De LA's got a stupid voice!</i>
<i>Santino's asshole is loose."</i>

08:26.773 --> 08:29.975
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>Oh, Bianca.</i>
<i>Looks like your lace front is</i>

08:29.977 --> 08:32.844
<i>coming off.</i>
<i>"Baloney!</i>
<i>I have no problems!</i>

08:32.846 --> 08:36.147
<i>I live in New York!</i>
<i>I work all the time!"</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

08:36.149 --> 08:38.517
<i>"Baloney!</i>
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>Assholes!</i>

08:38.519 --> 08:44.923
<i>Ah!"</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> nice work, my little lamb</i>

08:44.925 --> 08:49.928
<i>chops.</i>
<i>The winner of today's mini</i>
<i>challenge is...</i>

08:49.930 --> 08:53.832
<i>Ben de LA creme.</i>
<i> Yay!</i>
<i>I knew if I hitched myself to</i>

08:53.834 --> 08:56.234
<i>this wagon, it would pull me</i>
<i>somewhere.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

08:56.236 --> 08:58.436
<i>Baloney!</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> For this week's main</i>

08:58.438 --> 09:04.843
<i>challenge, the house of RuPaul</i>
<i>is throwing the first ever</i>
<i>glitter ball.</i>

09:04.845 --> 09:09.414
<i> [Gasps]</i>
<i> You need to serve three</i>
<i>distinct looks.</i>

09:09.416 --> 09:11.616
<i>First category is banjee girl</i>

09:11.618 --> 09:12.284
<i>bling.</i>

09:12.286 --> 09:12.951
<i> Ooh.</i>

09:12.953 --> 09:14.486
<i> Second category is platinum</i>

09:14.488 --> 09:16.821
<i>card executive realness.</i>

09:16.823 --> 09:19.491
<i>And the last and shiniest of all</i>

09:19.493 --> 09:21.226
<i>category is...</i>

09:21.228 --> 09:25.664
<i>Dripping in jewels eleganza!</i>

09:25.666 --> 09:29.734
<i> So that means that it's</i>
<i>another costume challenge.</i>
<i>Holy shit.</i>

09:29.736 --> 09:35.807
<i> Now, using all these</i>
<i>sickening stones provided by</i>
<i>fierce! Drag jewels and</i>

09:35.809 --> 09:42.948
<i>materials from the fabric planet</i>
<i>wall, I expect you to "sparkle,</i>
<i>neely, sparkle."</i>

09:42.950 --> 09:49.187
<i>Ben de LA creme, you won the</i>
<i>mini challenge, so you get to</i>
<i>assign the jewel tones.</i>

09:49.189 --> 09:55.727
<i>There's diamond, Ruby, topaz,</i>
<i>sapphire, and rose quartz.</i>
<i>Rose quartz?</i>

09:55.729 --> 09:58.496
<i>I think I went to Hebrew school</i>
<i>with her.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

09:58.498 --> 10:04.970
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines,</i>
<i>and may the best woman win.</i>
<i> We have to come up with three</i>

10:04.972 --> 10:07.572
<i>looks.</i>
<i>One of them has to be from</i>
<i>scratch.</i>

10:07.574 --> 10:13.111
<i>And we've got, like, a day to do</i>
<i>it.</i>

10:13.113 --> 10:16.648
<i> The heat is on.</i>

10:16.650 --> 10:17.816
<i>Ugh!</i>

10:17.818 --> 10:19.150
<i> I just get really, like,</i>

10:19.152 --> 10:20.018
<i>discouraged and, like,</i>

10:20.020 --> 10:22.520
<i>frustrated.</i>

10:22.522 --> 10:24.022
<i> [Laughs]</i>

10:24.024 --> 10:28.793
<i> [Laughs]</i>

10:28.795 --> 10:32.364
<i> Come on, diamond.</i>

10:32.366 --> 10:33.431
<i>Oh.</i>

10:33.433 --> 10:34.933
<i> For today's main challenge,</i>

10:34.935 --> 10:36.101
<i>we're getting ready for the "all</i>

10:36.103 --> 10:37.535
<i>that glitters ball."</i>

10:37.537 --> 10:43.575
<i>We need to create three distinct</i>
<i>looks: Banjee girl bling,</i>
<i>platinum card executive</i>

10:43.577 --> 10:49.681
<i>realness, and dripping in</i>
<i>jewels eleganza in our</i>
<i>designated jewel tone.</i>

10:49.683 --> 10:52.484
<i> Ugh!</i>
<i> You all right?</i>
<i> I'm just having some</i>

10:52.486 --> 10:54.886
<i>in the past, we've had to create</i>

10:54.888 --> 10:56.221
<i>one look for the runway, but</i>

10:56.223 --> 10:58.657
<i>this is three separate looks.</i>

10:58.659 --> 11:06.865
<i>Everybody is pretty worried</i>
<i>about this challenge, except, of</i>
<i>course, Bianca Del Rio.</i>

11:06.867 --> 11:12.037
<i> I like this to start with.</i>
<i> She's kind of the marker you</i>
<i>have to be looking at.</i>

11:12.039 --> 11:16.107
<i>Because she has the sewing</i>
<i>skills, she can just bang things</i>
<i>out a lot faster than the rest</i>

11:16.109 --> 11:18.543
<i>of us can.</i>
<i> That's pretty.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

11:18.545 --> 11:22.647
<i> Fuck off.</i>
<i> So wait a minute.</i>
<i>What made you pick me as</i>

11:22.649 --> 11:26.117
<i>sapphire?</i>
<i> I didn't feel like any of the</i>
<i>colors were positives or</i>

11:26.119 --> 11:29.654
<i>negatives.</i>
<i>I thought the only one that was,</i>
<i>like, sort of especially easy</i>

11:29.656 --> 11:33.558
<i>was diamonds, which is why I</i>
<i>threw it to Adore.</i>
<i> Really?</i>

11:33.560 --> 11:37.128
<i>Why not just give her cement</i>
<i>shoes and throw her in the</i>
<i>water and give her something</i>

11:37.130 --> 11:42.967
<i>really rough?</i>
<i> 'Cause she's not an evil</i>
<i>cunt.</i>

11:42.969 --> 11:45.437
<i> I mean, this is a</i>
<i>competition.</i>
<i> So?</i>

11:45.439 --> 11:49.074
<i>Bitch!</i>
<i>I wouldn't throw you under the</i>
<i>damn ocean.</i>

11:49.076 --> 11:51.376
<i>Only an insecure bitch would say</i>
<i>something like that.</i>

11:51.378 --> 11:52.911
<i>It is a competition, but you</i>

11:52.913 --> 11:54.045
<i>don't have to sabotage anybody</i>

11:54.047 --> 11:55.647
<i>on the way there.</i>

11:55.649 --> 11:59.117
<i> Am I being hateful by saying</i>
<i>that?</i>
<i> No, you're being real.</i>

11:59.119 --> 12:04.355
<i> And that's what I am, a-real.</i>
<i> And your real self is</i>
<i>hateful.</i>

12:04.357 --> 12:07.292
<i> People say that I'm being</i>

12:07.294 --> 12:09.994
<i>mean, but I'm in this for a</i>

12:09.996 --> 12:12.030
<i>crown and $100,000.</i>

12:12.032 --> 12:16.768
<i>You help yourself before you</i>
<i>help others.</i>
<i> Hello, hello, hello.</i>

12:16.770 --> 12:19.804
<i> Hello, hello.</i>
<i> Hello, hello, hello.</i>
<i> How are things in the</i>

12:19.806 --> 12:24.008
<i>jewelries district?</i>
<i> I'm stoned.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

12:24.010 --> 12:27.212
<i>Adore Delano.</i>
<i> Hi, Ru.</i>
<i> All right, so what are you</i>

12:27.214 --> 12:31.249
<i>thinking about for your dripping</i>
<i>in jewels eleganza?</i>
<i> I was thinking of just, like,</i>

12:31.251 --> 12:34.319
<i>bejeweling the hell out of this.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> But I want--I don't know.</i>

12:34.321 --> 12:37.388
<i>I have, like, so many ideas,</i>
<i>and that's the thing.</i>
<i>Like, I think, like, of so many</i>

12:37.390 --> 12:41.960
<i>things, and I just really want</i>
<i>to get it, like--it done.</i>
<i> What can you show the judges</i>

12:41.962 --> 12:48.133
<i>to let them know that you are</i>
<i>top-three material?</i>
<i> I just think, like, what I</i>

12:48.135 --> 12:53.671
<i>had in the beginning or</i>
<i>whatever, like, it kinda got</i>
<i>lost.</i>

12:53.673 --> 13:05.383
<i>I just get really, like,</i>
<i>discouraged and, like,</i>
<i>frustrated.</i>

13:05.385 --> 13:08.119
<i>[Crying]</i>
<i>I don't want to be, like, the</i>
<i>chiona,</i> like, that cries all

13:08.121 --> 13:12.323
the time, but it just pisses me
off because I feel like I'm so
talented, like, in other things,

13:12.325 --> 13:17.595
so it's, like, why can't, like,
my brain, like, allow me to
make a fucking dress?

13:17.597 --> 13:19.931
Right, right.
It's, like, I don't want to
lip-sync again.

13:19.933 --> 13:23.935
I came here to be, like, top
three and to fucking win it.
Right, right.

13:23.937 --> 13:28.573
You know, one of the notes that
I've given you a lot is that you
have to learn to apply your

13:28.575 --> 13:32.177
great things, like in the
rapping or the singing.
You have to apply what you have

13:32.179 --> 13:35.914
there into the other challenges.
Right.
Put it in this fucking dress.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.416
You hear what I'm saying?
Yeah, I do.
All right, Adore.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.719
You get back to work.
Thanks.
Sorry for crying all the time.

13:41.721 --> 13:45.523
Emotions don't scare me.
[Laughs]
Thank you, Ru.

13:45.525 --> 13:49.627
All right.
All right, y'all.
Hi.

13:49.629 --> 13:53.064
I'm on the d.L.
Mm, yo, yo.
Now, you know, in the past,

13:53.066 --> 13:56.935
the judges have come after you
for this or that.
How do you feel about the

13:56.937 --> 13:59.804
judges' critiques?
You know, I feel I'm
listening, and I'm kind of

13:59.806 --> 14:03.341
getting it, and, like, trying to
really grow from it.
[Scoffs]

14:03.343 --> 14:06.477
You know, I mean, as large
as I am, I still have room to
grow.

14:06.479 --> 14:11.683
[Laughs] Don't we all?
Mm-hmm.
So why is it, do you think,

14:11.685 --> 14:20.491
you haven't won more challenges?
I think it's because it's,
like--partially, I think it--

14:20.493 --> 14:23.795
why haven't you won more
challenges?
[Laughs] I know.

14:23.797 --> 14:27.031
Because there's always a little
something off with me.
You got to win some

14:27.033 --> 14:31.636
challenges, you know.
Look at those fine-tune things
that you think the judges might

14:31.638 --> 14:34.105
come after you for.
Yes.
All right, you get back to

14:34.107 --> 14:38.509
work.
Thank you so much.
De LA.

14:38.511 --> 14:42.847
Hi, Ru.
Now, you haven't won a
challenge since Snatch Game.

14:42.849 --> 14:46.050
Yeah.
What are you gonna do to get
to the top of the heap this

14:46.052 --> 14:48.453
time?
What are you thinking for your
eleganza?

14:48.455 --> 14:52.590
I've been thinking about the
film <i>what a way to go.</i>
<i> Oh,</i> <i>what a way to go,</i> yes,

14:52.592 --> 14:55.126
uh-huh.
Yeah, and there's all those
just, like, insane cocktail

14:55.128 --> 14:57.595
party dresses.
Yes, yes.
I'm trying to channel that

14:57.597 --> 15:00.398
kind of feel.
Oh, I love that.
That sounds great.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.670
The last two challenges, I
was, like, this close to
winning, but I'm not gonna be

15:05.672 --> 15:11.142
second this time around.
Bianca can make the most
Broadway-rific costume.

15:11.144 --> 15:17.282
I am going to figure out a way
to make something that the
judges are going to be wowed by.

15:17.284 --> 15:24.322
All right, my rhinestone
cowgirls, gather around.
Now, tomorrow two of my extra

15:24.324 --> 15:29.961
favorite guest judges will be
returning.
The shining star of TV's royal

15:29.963 --> 15:34.832
family, khloe Kardashian, will
be here.
[All clapping]

15:34.834 --> 15:41.973
And fashion's most dazzling
designer ever, the one and only
Bob mackie.

15:41.975 --> 15:45.076
I Adore Bob mackie.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.611
He's designed for everyone:

15:46.613 --> 15:48.379
Cher, diahann carroll,

15:48.381 --> 15:50.648
Diana Ross, Liza minnelli,

15:50.650 --> 15:52.216
Barbara Streisand in <i>funny lady.</i>

15:52.218 --> 15:53.584
<i>He's done everything.</i>

15:53.586 --> 15:56.621
<i> Oh, and, um, just one more</i>
<i>thing.</i>
<i> Oh, here we go.</i>

15:56.623 --> 16:01.926
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> In addition to creating three</i>
<i>ball looks, you'll be putting on</i>

16:01.928 --> 16:09.067
<i>the glitz in a flawless opening</i>
<i>number.</i>
<i>Now, de LA, you won the mini</i>

16:09.069 --> 16:13.237
<i>challenge, so you're in charge</i>
<i>of choreography.</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

16:13.239 --> 16:20.445
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> The only time I've seen de LA</i>
<i>dance is during her lip sync,</i>

16:20.447 --> 16:25.249
<i>and if I recall, she did bear</i>
<i>similarities to a rubber</i>
<i>chicken.</i>

16:25.251 --> 16:28.920
<i> Good luck, my precious gems,</i>
<i>and don't fuck it up.</i>

16:28.922 --> 16:32.123
<i> I hate that.</i>

16:32.125 --> 16:32.790
<i> Oh, no.</i>

16:32.792 --> 16:33.458
<i> What if we did this?</i>

16:33.460 --> 16:34.325
<i> Rubies and emeralds </i>

16:34.327 --> 16:35.593
<i> and dah, dah, dah, dah </i>

16:35.595 --> 16:36.627
<i>and then we're all in a row.</i>

16:36.629 --> 16:37.595
<i> Why don't we just do our own</i>

16:37.597 --> 16:38.796
<i>thing?</i>

16:38.798 --> 16:40.365
<i> Um, it'd be good to just have</i>

16:40.367 --> 16:42.467
<i>one boss, not five.</i>

16:42.469 --> 16:43.534
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

16:43.536 --> 16:45.136
<i> [Laughs]</i>

16:45.138 --> 16:50.875
<i> [Laughs]</i>

16:50.877 --> 16:55.813
<i>  Rubies and emeralds </i>
<i>  always wear a jewel </i>
<i> let's get this shit over</i>

16:55.815 --> 16:57.815
<i> so in addition to creating</i>

16:57.817 --> 16:59.117
<i>three looks for the all that</i>

16:59.119 --> 17:00.618
<i>glitters ball, we also have to</i>

17:00.620 --> 17:02.086
<i>create and choreograph an</i>

17:02.088 --> 17:03.154
<i>opening number.</i>

17:03.156 --> 17:08.092
<i> Um, all right.</i>
<i>Is anybody specifically, like,</i>
<i>choreography inclined?</i>

17:08.094 --> 17:10.628
<i> I can do it and do it easily.</i>
<i> Okay.</i>

17:10.630 --> 17:11.329
<i>It's definitely a lot of</i>

17:11.331 --> 17:13.898
<i>pressure to be in charge of this</i>

17:13.900 --> 17:14.832
<i>choreography.</i>

17:14.834 --> 17:20.438
<i>I'm definitely going to get all</i>
<i>the help I can get from Courtney</i>
<i>'cause Courtney has done more</i>

17:20.440 --> 17:23.908
<i>choreography than I have.</i>
<i> Darienne, do you want to</i>
<i>stand here?</i>

17:23.910 --> 17:27.011
<i>Adore, do you want to stand</i>
<i>here?</i>
<i>And I think if we're all on</i>

17:27.013 --> 17:32.750
<i>profile looking out with, like,</i>
<i>our stoles around our necks.</i>
<i>Then that's when de LA will</i>

17:32.752 --> 17:36.854
<i>come sort of bursting through</i>
<i>the middle sort of thing.</i>
<i> Okay.</i>

17:36.856 --> 17:40.491
<i> What if we did this?</i>
<i>What if we're all here, and then</i>
<i>on our lines...</i>

17:40.493 --> 17:44.128
<i> Rubies and emeralds </i>
<i> and dah, dah, dah, dah </i>
<i>and then we're all in a row.</i>

17:44.130 --> 17:46.864
<i> Or we could even do, like,</i>
<i>you know, the house down, and</i>
<i>just, you know...</i>

17:46.866 --> 17:49.567
<i> Oh, yeah.</i>
<i> Get rid of our things so we</i>
<i>don't have to hold onto these.</i>

17:49.569 --> 17:53.404
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i>Can we just throw them?</i>
<i> Um--</i>

17:53.406 --> 17:54.405
<i>it's challenging when there's</i>

17:54.407 --> 17:55.206
<i>five people trying to</i>

17:55.208 --> 17:56.207
<i>choreograph a number.</i>

17:56.209 --> 17:59.343
<i>Like, everybody's throwing their</i>
<i>few cents in.</i>
<i>It'd be good to just have one</i>

17:59.345 --> 18:05.550
<i>boss, not five.</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i> all:  forever wear a... </i>

18:05.552 --> 18:08.853
<i> Je-e-ewel </i>
<i> oh.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

18:08.855 --> 18:12.123
<i>  Oh, yeah, yeah </i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Oh, no.</i>

18:12.125 --> 18:15.126
<i> I hate that.</i>
<i> It's too fast.</i>
<i> The ending seems like we</i>

18:15.128 --> 18:18.529
<i>drank caffeine and went to a</i>
<i>zumba class.</i>
<i> Very that.</i>

18:18.531 --> 18:21.532
<i>Why don't we just do our own</i>
<i>thing?</i>
<i> Because I think we're trying</i>

18:21.534 --> 18:23.534
<i>to look polished and--</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> Well, because then, like,</i>

18:23.536 --> 18:25.770
<i>okay.</i>
<i> All right, you guys, we've</i>
<i>only got, like--we've only got</i>

18:25.772 --> 18:28.106
<i>a few minutes left, so let's</i>
<i>just go--</i>
<i> let's try it, let's try it.</i>

18:28.108 --> 18:28.840
<i> Courtney, God bless her soul,</i>

18:28.842 --> 18:30.007
<i>but ain't nobody got time to be</i>

18:30.009 --> 18:31.175
<i>learning how to do pirouettes</i>

18:31.177 --> 18:33.111
<i>and...All this shit.</i>

18:33.113 --> 18:40.952
<i>It's like, "bitch, I need to get</i>
<i>this dress done."</i>
<i> Rehearsal didn't go smoothly,</i>

18:40.954 --> 18:45.089
<i>so now, the mood in the room is</i>
<i>just focus.</i>
<i>There's no room for error</i>

18:45.091 --> 18:50.161
<i>because this challenge is gonna</i>
<i>determine who's in the top four,</i>
<i>and the odds are getting</i>

18:50.163 --> 18:56.367
<i>narrower and narrower.</i>
<i> I hate you so fucking much.</i>
<i>[Sighs]</i>

18:56.369 --> 19:00.304
<i> Darienne, you all right?</i>
<i> I'm horrible, couldn't be</i>
<i>worse.</i>

19:00.306 --> 19:03.374
<i> What happened, Darienne?</i>
<i> Well, I'm starting over at</i>
<i>zero.</i>

19:03.376 --> 19:06.711
<i> Changing it?</i>
<i> Yeah, I have to.</i>
<i>I'm going with a whole new</i>

19:06.713 --> 19:09.747
<i>dress, whole new fabric, whole</i>
<i>new everything.</i>

19:09.749 --> 19:11.415
<i>I did a dress, but it's not</i>

19:11.417 --> 19:12.416
<i>really saying, "dripping in</i>

19:12.418 --> 19:15.219
<i>jewels eleganza," so now I'm</i>

19:15.221 --> 19:17.688
<i>starting all over at square one.</i>

19:17.690 --> 19:24.362
<i>What the fuck am I thinking?</i>
<i>I'm fucked.</i>
<i>[Sighs]</i>

19:24.364 --> 19:27.298
<i> How you doing over there,</i>
<i>Adore?</i>
<i> So far, I think so good.</i>

19:27.300 --> 19:33.037
<i>So after talking to Ru, it's</i>
<i>fucking definitely game on.</i>
<i>Like nuts to the guts, balls to</i>

19:33.039 --> 19:37.441
<i>the walls.</i>
<i>But I'm still not a seamstress,</i>
<i>and Jesus knows that, so it's</i>

19:37.443 --> 19:42.146
<i>kinda so much pressure!</i>
<i>Ugh!</i>
<i>I wanted to just drench this in</i>

19:42.148 --> 19:44.615
<i>diamonds.</i>
<i> Well, you have a lot of</i>
<i>rhinestones.</i>

19:44.617 --> 19:46.851
<i> Kinda, yeah.</i>
<i> What about that pretty stuff</i>
<i>under your table?</i>

19:46.853 --> 19:48.920
<i> That?</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> I was gonna use that as a</i>

19:48.922 --> 19:54.425
<i>tutu, but I don't know how.</i>
<i> Why don't you gather that up?</i>
<i> Gather it up?</i>

19:54.427 --> 20:00.264
<i> Wait, I'll show you.</i>
<i>What you really could do is cut</i>
<i>it evenly to a length, okay,</i>

20:00.266 --> 20:03.067
<i>and gather it on top.</i>
<i> Uh-huh.</i>
<i> I think Adore is struggling</i>

20:03.069 --> 20:06.938
<i>in this challenge 'cause she</i>
<i>really doesn't know how to</i>
<i>execute costumes, much less her</i>

20:06.940 --> 20:10.341
<i>tulle.</i>
<i>She can't even spell it.</i>
<i> You're supposed to cut it in</i>

20:10.343 --> 20:13.811
<i>strips, and just glue it like</i>
<i>that, right?</i>
<i> Oh, no, not like that.</i>

20:13.813 --> 20:16.948
<i> It looks ugly.</i>
<i> Yeah, it does.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

20:16.950 --> 20:22.954
<i>I don't know how to make a</i>
<i>fucking tutu.</i>
<i> I look at Adore's dress, and</i>

20:22.956 --> 20:26.791
<i>I'm like, "okay, I think I'm</i>
<i>safe, thank God."</i>
<i> Oh, you mean, like, wrap it</i>

20:26.793 --> 20:31.329
<i>and then--I don't fucking make</i>
<i>clothes.</i>
<i> Adore has been in the bottom</i>

20:31.331 --> 20:34.765
<i>not once, but twice.</i>
<i>She's here by the skin of her</i>
<i>teeth.</i>

20:34.767 --> 20:41.739
<i>If she can't deliver on another</i>
<i>challenge, it's gonna be hard</i>
<i>for Ru to keep her in the game.</i>

20:41.741 --> 20:51.849
<i>[RuPaul's</i> <i>covergirl]</i>

<i> [Laughs]</i>

<i> Whoo-hoo!</i>
<i> Ready.</i>

21:54.180 --> 21:56.681
<i> I like the last one the best,</i>

21:56.683 --> 21:57.848

21:57.850 --> 21:59.283
<i> If you're gonna shimmy and</i>

<i> Everything's coming up roses.</i>

<i> Like a tall glass of</i>
<i>sparkling rose.</i>

26:11.804 --> 26:17.908
<i>Adore in diamonds.</i>
<i> Mmm.</i>
<i></i> <i>Blade runner</i> eleganza!

26:17.910 --> 26:23.180
Yes, Darryl Hannah.
I look like a really cool
diamond princess that just broke

26:23.182 --> 26:29.320
out of a globe, but now she
needs a prince on her shackle.
Adore in the sky with

26:29.322 --> 26:35.459
diamonds.
Bianca Del Rio in sapphire.
Ladyboy sings the blues.

26:35.461 --> 26:40.497
I'm giving you upper eastside
eleganza.
I'm feeling grand and regal.

26:40.499 --> 26:47.204
Her ass is on sapphire.
[Laughter]
Darienne Lake in topaz.

26:47.206 --> 26:52.910
Bronze goddess.
I am giving you a touch of
slave princess Leia.

26:52.912 --> 26:59.083
Glamour from head to topaz.
Courtney Act in rubies.
Work it, honey.

26:59.085 --> 27:06.156
Red alert.
I'm covered from nose to lace
front in red sparkling glitter.

27:06.158 --> 27:12.663
Red, fulfilled.
Now sissy that walk.
Welcome, my precious jewels.

27:12.665 --> 27:18.002
It's time for the judges'
appraisals.
First up, Ben de LA creme.

27:18.004 --> 27:21.839
I was confused by your banjee
girl.
I loved the outfit.

27:21.841 --> 27:25.542
I'm into, like, hoochie mama it
up.
I just did not get the tulle.

27:25.544 --> 27:28.512
It was more distracting than
anything.
As far as your executive

27:28.514 --> 27:31.982
realness, that's the one I had a
problem with.
I don't believe that you're

27:31.984 --> 27:35.185
gonna run any business dressed
like that.
It was a cocktail dress.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.789
You look beautiful in it, but
that's not what the category
was.

27:38.791 --> 27:44.862
I'm always hoping that you
surprise me, and this week, you
didn't really do that.

27:44.864 --> 27:51.835
Next up, Adore Delano.
Dripping in diamonds.
Frickin' Adore.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.772
Hi.
For real?
What?

27:54.774 --> 27:59.943
You made me so happy tonight,
I could kiss you!
Oh, my God.

27:59.945 --> 28:04.915
Are we gonna tongue?
[Laughter]
Kids, that was how you do a

28:04.917 --> 28:07.885
banjee girl look.
You killed it.
Phenomenal.

28:07.887 --> 28:11.422
Love the attitude.
I would wear those boots and
nothing else.

28:11.424 --> 28:14.625
I do it, I vacuum in them.
Honey, I would too.
[Laughs]

28:14.627 --> 28:17.728
This goofy thing you have on
now is just perfect.
[Laughs]

28:17.730 --> 28:19.797
Your wig and your skirt are
like sisters.
They look the same shape

28:19.799 --> 28:21.999
exactly.
Yes!
I just loved the whole thing.

28:22.001 --> 28:26.103
It made me really laugh.
So during the walkthrough,
you had an emotional

28:26.105 --> 28:29.807
breakthrough, and it showed on
stage.
Well, the thing is, I had an

28:29.809 --> 28:32.309
epiphany when I was taking a
bathtub.
[Laughs]

28:32.311 --> 28:34.344
Right.
I was just like, "you know
what?

28:34.346 --> 28:36.947
Like, no more <i>chiona</i> ass shit."
Right.
"You're in season six."

28:36.949 --> 28:39.650
Right.
"It's game time."
Fucking party.

28:39.652 --> 28:45.155
I'm excited.
All right, up next,
Bianca Del Rio in sapphire.

28:45.157 --> 28:48.258
That's a good drag name.
[Laughs]
Sapphire!

28:48.260 --> 28:52.196
I like your executive outfit.
I've known that woman.
She's really all business.

28:52.198 --> 28:56.467
But this last one looks, to me,
like a bar mitzvah mother.
[Laughter]

28:56.469 --> 28:59.203
I'd just like to take off at
least one of those ruffled
things.

28:59.205 --> 29:03.373
Last time I was here, you did
a similar silhouette to the
dress that you're wearing now.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.910
Yeah.
I wish I could see something
different.

29:06.912 --> 29:12.249
Next up, Darienne Lake in
topaz.
The banjee girl.

29:12.251 --> 29:17.087
What?
Darienne, that was more rave.
Like, there was nothing street

29:17.089 --> 29:20.624
to me.
Executive realness, didn't buy
that either.

29:20.626 --> 29:25.462
Where?
Jiffy lube?
Now, this look, that topaz color

29:25.464 --> 29:29.366
looks beautiful on you.
What's bothering me is that it's
droopy.

29:29.368 --> 29:32.369
Those jewels are heavy.
And your fabric is
stretching.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.772
That's what it is.
Right.
I was going for that sort of

29:34.774 --> 29:40.377
slave princess Leia thing, but I
ended up looking more like if
her and jabba had a baby.

29:40.379 --> 29:46.683
It's unfortunate, 'cause the
concept is there, but it was
just not a very successful set

29:46.685 --> 29:52.389
of looks that we saw from you
tonight.
Next up, Courtney Act in

29:52.391 --> 29:56.627
rubies.
Your banjee girl, to me, not
banjee.

29:56.629 --> 29:59.596
What we got was, like, rocker
chick wearing my boyfriend's
flannel shirt.

29:59.598 --> 30:03.367
I had gold bamboo hoop
earrings, Michelle.
Girl, bamboo earrings does

30:03.369 --> 30:08.005
not a banjee girl make, and if
you're gonna shimmy and show us
your cakes, you have to have

30:08.007 --> 30:10.841
cakes.
There was pads in there.
Girl, it was so small.

30:10.843 --> 30:13.844
You need to pad more.
Okay.
Go rob a couch.

30:13.846 --> 30:18.916
[Laughter]
This is my favorite of the
eleganza looks.

30:18.918 --> 30:24.588
It's one of those effortlessly
chic gowns that you would see on
the runway of a lot of different

30:24.590 --> 30:31.428
designers.
Ladies, I hate to tarnish
this shining moment, but I must

30:31.430 --> 30:36.300
ask, which one of you should go
home tonight?
Oh, God.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.669
And why?

30:38.671 --> 30:43.941
She frequently assumes she is

30:43.943 --> 30:46.210
doing better than people from an

30:46.212 --> 30:47.945
outside perspective might see.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.581
Whatever, queen.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.182
[Laughs]

30:52.184 --> 30:57.020
[Laughs]

30:57.022 --> 31:04.761
Ladies, I must ask...Which one
of you should go home tonight?
And why?

31:04.763 --> 31:09.266
Let's start with de LA.
I think Darienne.
Everyone else who's here has

31:09.268 --> 31:16.807
really shown an ability to hear
critique and adjust, and some
folks, like Bianca, just sail

31:16.809 --> 31:24.047
through, but Darienne, I think
she frequently assumes she is
doing better than people from an

31:24.049 --> 31:29.286
outside perspective might see.
All right, thanks, de LA.
Adore Delano.

31:29.288 --> 31:34.591
I feel, based on this
challenge, Darienne.
Bianca Del Rio.

31:34.593 --> 31:37.661
If it's about this particular
challenge, I would have to say
Darienne.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.796
And you know I'm not gonna lie
to you.
I know.

31:39.798 --> 31:42.366
Which is why I'm called a
bitch, and apparently, I'm
sailing now.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.968
Is that a bad thing?
Whatever, queen.
Why is that an insult?

31:44.970 --> 31:48.238
I should pick your ass just
for being a cunt.
That was, like, you're good

31:48.240 --> 31:50.707
at stuff.
Yeah, yeah, no, that was
very condescending.

31:50.709 --> 31:57.080
[Mocking laugh]
Darienne Lake, same question.
I think, Darienne, you

31:57.082 --> 32:01.551
should really go home for what
you have done today.
Think about what you did, and

32:01.553 --> 32:05.956
realize the criticism.
Who I think should go home?
Whoever does not lip-sync for

32:05.958 --> 32:11.395
their life.
Okay, Courtney Act.
Coming into this competition,

32:11.397 --> 32:18.502
I earmarked Adore as being
top three, and over the last
few weeks, she's kind of tripped

32:18.504 --> 32:23.307
and stumbled, so I think that
she would be the next one to go,
but I guess, based on tonight's

32:23.309 --> 32:29.346
comments, I'm gonna say
Darienne.
So your answer is Adore and

32:29.348 --> 32:33.684
Darienne?
[Laughter]
Thank you, ladies.

32:33.686 --> 32:39.523
While you unwind in the untucked
lounge, the judges and I will
deliberate.

32:39.525 --> 32:44.494
Just between us rhinestoners,
what do you think?
Let's start with Ben de LA

32:44.496 --> 32:47.798
creme.
Well, you know, with Ben de
LA, my issue is she's not

32:47.800 --> 32:51.868
memorable.
I totally did not even realize
she was in the opening act, and

32:51.870 --> 32:54.604
I think how she makes stuff
looks cheap.
I agree.

32:54.606 --> 32:58.642
Most of what she wore was not
very successful.
I liked rose quartz the best,

32:58.644 --> 33:02.279
and I didn't even like it.
[Laughs]
It's like an old Betty grable

33:02.281 --> 33:05.515
outfit.
I actually thought it was
cute, kind of pony, showgirl

33:05.517 --> 33:10.153
look for Ben de LA, but
something we have seen many
times before.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.523
At this stage in the game, I
don't know if we're every gonna
get anything different than what

33:13.525 --> 33:17.394
we've gotten from Ben de LA.
All right, let's move on down
to Adore.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.864
I loved Adore.
Anyone could wear an outfit,
not everybody could carry it,

33:20.866 --> 33:25.002
and I think Adore, no matter
what look she did, she embodied
that personality.

33:25.004 --> 33:30.273
I agree.
I mean, it's not so much that
her looks were so much better

33:30.275 --> 33:34.011
than everyone else's, but she
sold 'em to us.
Yeah.

33:34.013 --> 33:38.749
It wasn't just a girl in an
outfit.
I was amused all night by her.

33:38.751 --> 33:41.952
With that said, I'm not sure
I would have noticed Adore in
the opening number if she

33:41.954 --> 33:46.289
hadn't tripped every time.
[Laughter]
Moving on, Bianca Del Rio.

33:46.291 --> 33:50.460
Bob, I'm surprised you didn't
like her sapphire dress more.
No, I didn't.

33:50.462 --> 33:54.931
It wasn't new or interesting or
old-time glamour even.
I just didn't get it.

33:54.933 --> 34:00.937
But the things she did this
week, none of 'em were so off
the mark, and her execution is

34:00.939 --> 34:04.741
on point to her vision.
Let's move on down to
Darienne Lake.

34:04.743 --> 34:09.312
She did a great
Marilyn Monroe, and then, we
didn't slowly descend.

34:09.314 --> 34:13.550
We crash-landed.
[Laughter]
I have no idea what she was

34:13.552 --> 34:17.587
thinking for really any of the
looks.
The banjee look is so

34:17.589 --> 34:21.024
unflattering.
And then the shoes were just
the friggin' cherry on top.

34:21.026 --> 34:24.061
Where did you buy them?
W--hello?
The michelin man shoes?

34:24.063 --> 34:27.798
Throw them away.
[Laughs]
But she's got a great

34:27.800 --> 34:32.335
attitude.
She knew that she had missed the
mark, and I'd rather that than

34:32.337 --> 34:35.939
somebody go like, "no,
everything I did was great, and
I'm perfect."

34:35.941 --> 34:40.143
All right, let's move on to
Courtney Act.
I'm getting, dare I say,

34:40.145 --> 34:43.780
bored with this pretty thing.
Like, the red outfit was a
pretty piece of fabric with a

34:43.782 --> 34:47.584
pretty bra.
It's coasting now.
She does rely on that, but

34:47.586 --> 34:51.288
that's who she is.
She is beautiful.
$100,000.

34:51.290 --> 34:57.494
Give me something.
You know, as simple as her
eleganza look looks, it took

34:57.496 --> 35:00.430
time in finessing, and it
wasn't just--
I'm surprised you're saying

35:00.432 --> 35:02.499
that because you're the one
who's like...
Okay?

35:02.501 --> 35:05.001
"It's unfinished, you know,
you don't have a hem."
Yeah, but she--

35:05.003 --> 35:07.437
he wants to say whatever I
say, the opposite.
No, I don't.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.540
I don't care what you say.
[Laughter]
I'm just sayin--I say whatever,

35:10.542 --> 35:14.578
but I really feel it's really
funny how you really dislike
that look.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.746
I don't dislike it.
I thought, "I don't know what
her--"

35:16.748 --> 35:20.383
I just think it's basic.
Silence!
I've made my decision.

35:20.385 --> 35:27.257
[Laughs]

35:27.259 --> 35:38.001
[Laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

35:38.003 --> 35:41.471
Bianca Del Rio, you're safe.

35:41.473 --> 35:53.049
Adore Delano, tonight, you had
an epiphany, and we had a ball.
Condragulations, you're the

35:53.051 --> 35:56.486
winner of this week's challenge.
[All clapping]
Oh, my God.

35:56.488 --> 36:01.958
You've won a drag-tastic
costume from kicka custom
designs.

36:01.960 --> 36:06.496
I just won a sewing
challenge.
I'm really, really proud of

36:06.498 --> 36:12.536
myself.
Darienne Lake.
As Marilyn, you

36:12.538 --> 36:19.776
"boop-oop-a-doop-ed," but on
the runway, your eleganza just
drooped.

36:19.778 --> 36:26.783
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
Ben de LA creme, your classic

36:26.785 --> 36:34.191
de LA silhouettes didn't keep
the glitter ball rolling.
Courtney Act, your beauty is

36:34.193 --> 36:44.501
flawless, but your outfits
lacked clarity.
Courtney Act...

36:44.503 --> 36:53.243
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Ben de LA, I'm sorry, my dear,

36:53.245 --> 36:59.616
I have been in this exact

36:59.618 --> 37:01.384
position before, lip-syncing

37:01.386 --> 37:03.353
against Darienne Lake, but

37:03.355 --> 37:04.754
we're not gonna get saved a

37:04.756 --> 37:05.555
second time.

37:05.557 --> 37:12.829
Somebody is going home tonight.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance

37:12.831 --> 37:19.002
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
[Dramatic music]

37:19.004 --> 37:26.710
the time has come for you to
lip-sync for your life.

37:26.712 --> 37:35.652
good luck, and don't fuck it
up.

37:35.654 --> 37:40.957
You know the bed

37:40.959 --> 37:43.660
feels warmer

37:43.662 --> 37:51.801
sleeping here alone
sleeping here alone
you know I dream in color

37:51.803 --> 37:58.441
and do the things I want
you think you got
the best of me

37:58.443 --> 38:01.444
think you've had
the last laugh
bet you think

38:01.446 --> 38:05.682
I really, really want to be
in the top four.
I've earned this, and I don't

38:05.684 --> 38:08.885
want to go home.
think that I'll come
running back

38:08.887 --> 38:14.291
baby, you don't know me
'cause you're dead wrong
what doesn't kill you

38:14.293 --> 38:19.596
makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean I'm lonely

38:19.598 --> 38:23.566
when I'm alone
what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger

38:23.568 --> 38:27.437
this song is speaking to me
right now.
Wounded or not, I'm gonna come

38:27.439 --> 38:30.774
back swinging, and that's what
I'm doing.
what doesn't kill you

38:30.776 --> 38:36.112
makes you stronger
stand a little taller
doesn't mean I'm lonely

38:36.114 --> 38:43.286
when I'm alone
you heard that I was
starting over

38:43.288 --> 38:52.062
with someone new
they told you I was
moving on

38:52.064 --> 38:58.401
over you
you didn't think
that I'd come back

38:58.403 --> 39:02.605
I'd come back swinging
you tried to break me
but you see

39:02.607 --> 39:07.444
what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger
stand a little taller

39:07.446 --> 39:15.452
doesn't mean I'm lonely
when I'm alone
when I'm alone

39:15.454 --> 39:22.992
whoo!
[Laughs]

39:22.994 --> 39:29.933
[All clapping]
Wow.
Ladies, I've made my decision.

39:29.935 --> 39:37.574
[Dramatic music]
Darienne Lake...

39:37.576 --> 39:46.549
Shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.

39:46.551 --> 39:59.462
De LA.
Girl, I love you, and I expect
great things from you, 'cause

39:59.464 --> 40:07.637
the cream always rises to the
top.
Now, sashay away.

40:07.639 --> 40:12.142
[Applause]

40:12.144 --> 40:21.551
I am disappointed to be going
home sooner than I would have
liked to, but I feel proud of

40:21.553 --> 40:27.390
myself, and I've learned a lot
being here.
Ru, you taught me what drag was.

40:27.392 --> 40:30.160
Thank you.
Thank you for seeing something
in me.

40:30.162 --> 40:39.169
This has been a pretty
incredible experience.
My final four queens, one

40:39.171 --> 40:46.209
challenge stands between you and
victory.
Remember, if you can't love

40:46.211 --> 40:50.346
yourself, how in the hell you
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?

40:50.348 --> 40:53.850
All: Amen!
All right, now let the music
play.

40:53.852 --> 40:57.654
[RuPaul's <i>dance with "u"]</i>
<i> </i>
<i> I wanna dance, dance </i>

40:57.656 --> 41:04.327
<i> I wanna dance, dance </i>
<i> I wanna dance, dance </i>
<i> dance with you </i>
