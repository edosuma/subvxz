THAT'S ELLIOTT RICHMOND.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.241
HE'S A BLACK-MARKET
ARMS TRAFFICKER.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.895
RUMOR IS HE MADE A FORTUNE
MOVING M240s.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.767
A FORTUNE HE SPENDS
ON ART.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.944

FOR IMPRESSIONISTS.

FOR GUYS LIKE THIS.

OVER THE PAST DECADE, A MAJORITY
OF BLACK-MARKET DEALERS

18:01.602 --> 18:02.733
STOPPED TRADING IN CASH.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.736
TOO EASY TO TRACE,
TOO UNWIELDY.

INSTEAD OF CARRYING DUFFEL BAGS
WITH MILLIONS IN BANK NOTES --

18:09.523 --> 18:11.612
IT'S EASIER TO TRADE
A SINGLE PIECE OF ART
WORTH THE SAME AMOUNT.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.049
NEAL, RUMOR IS

18:14.136 --> 18:16.747
YOU'VE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE
IN THIS PAYMENT PROCESS.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.140
WELL,
DETAILS ARE SENSITIVE,

ALLEGEDLY TRADED A MANET

OF STOLEN IDENTITIES.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.976
WHAT'S OUR ANGLE
ON RICHMOND?

18:28.063 --> 18:31.632
RICHMOND KEEPS A PENTHOUSE
AT 75 WALL.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.068
HE DOESN'T OWN ANY OTHER
PROPERTY IN THE CITY,

18:33.155 --> 18:34.548
AND HE LOVES TO LOOK
AT HIS ART,

18:34.635 --> 18:37.507

WHERE HE'S KEEPING THE DEGAS.
