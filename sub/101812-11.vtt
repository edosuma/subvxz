20:43.459 --> 20:45.244
I'm heading back into
the lion's den.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.289
MacGYVER:
Agreed. We need to
get out of the area now.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.248
[shouting, clamoring]

20:55.732 --> 20:57.473
Mac!

20:59.519 --> 21:01.434
Mac!

21:01.477 --> 21:04.045
[grunting]

21:04.088 --> 21:05.612
We gotta get out
of the city.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.048
Where should we go?Anywhere.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.745
Good idea.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.183
Whoa, something's happening,
Mac.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.316
Riley, do you see any
surveillance cameras nearby?

21:20.191 --> 21:21.497
BOZER:
The system connected you two
to the break-in

21:21.541 --> 21:22.803
at the old city building.

21:22.846 --> 21:24.326
You've been made.
Get out of there.

21:24.370 --> 21:27.198
Aah! Facial recognition.
Let's go!

21:29.113 --> 21:30.506
A kindness.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.160
Well, you can thank
the Geneva Convention.

21:32.203 --> 21:33.988
Besides...

21:34.031 --> 21:35.642
you'd be no good to me
if you died of thirst.

21:35.685 --> 21:37.339
Russell
Machiavelli.

21:37.383 --> 21:41.038
You're just upset
my tech has resurfaced

21:41.082 --> 21:43.302
and causing headaches again.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.347
Actually, we've made
improvements to your design.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.175
They are now
microscopic

21:47.218 --> 21:49.960
nano-trackers
that can be inhaled.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.702
They transmit
location and

21:52.746 --> 21:56.489
heartbeat... body temperature,
other biometrics.

21:56.532 --> 21:57.664
You're developing my tech.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.014
What kind of range do they have?

22:00.057 --> 22:02.016
Now that is the issue.

22:02.059 --> 22:03.365
Trackers are mere

22:03.409 --> 22:05.236
trinkets if their signal
doesn't get

22:05.280 --> 22:06.673
beyond a city block.

22:06.716 --> 22:10.241
I'd focus on the receiver
that scans for the trackers.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.460
Mine only had

22:11.504 --> 22:13.723
a sweep of
a thousand-square-foot radius.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.683
But piggybacking on a series

22:16.726 --> 22:19.512
of multi-source scanners

22:19.555 --> 22:22.079
could get you
a broader range.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.778
Yes, like a...

22:24.821 --> 22:27.389
a city's existing
cell tower infrastructure.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.564
Hmm.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.392
Yes.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.828
We'll try that.

22:31.872 --> 22:34.788
I know you're not developing
this technology yourself.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.574
I'd wager someone found

22:38.618 --> 22:41.708
my secret research lab,
the one you could never find.

22:41.751 --> 22:44.493
Now your agents
are in danger,

22:44.537 --> 22:46.452
and you're trying to help.

22:48.062 --> 22:50.804
The next solution I give
won't be so easy to earn.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.983
[lock buzzes, door opens]

22:56.026 --> 22:57.332
[door closes]

22:57.376 --> 22:58.942
Mac, they're using cell towers

22:58.986 --> 23:00.640
to scan
for the nano-tracker signals.

23:00.683 --> 23:03.251
You need to get everyone outside
of the city and out of range.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.732
MacGYVER:
Copy that.

23:05.775 --> 23:07.081
Desi, have you reached exfil?

23:07.124 --> 23:08.430
DESI:
Still have the package!

23:08.474 --> 23:11.215
But I had to take another
detour... to Colombia!

23:15.089 --> 23:16.395
Bozer, my exfil plan
went south--

23:16.438 --> 23:17.918
I'm gonna need a little bit
of help here!

23:20.224 --> 23:22.270
Mrs. Chanani!

23:23.358 --> 23:24.664
M-Mrs. Chanani!

23:24.707 --> 23:26.230
[gunfire continues]Bozer?

23:27.449 --> 23:28.929
Bozer, focus!

23:28.972 --> 23:31.888
Bozer, I need another exfil!

23:31.932 --> 23:34.630
I'm rerouting a tac team
from Paraguay now.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.937
I have been abandoned

23:36.980 --> 23:38.895
by my second tour
guide of the day.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.114
Where is Taylor?

23:41.550 --> 23:43.770
Bozer!Desi, get to these coordinates.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.815
The exfil's on its way.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.470
Uh... wait-wait a minute.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.906
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.692
Moving out of cell-tower
range worked.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.608
We're, uh, off the radar
for now at least.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.305
Does that mean we
can stop for a sec?

23:57.348 --> 23:58.437
My people are tired.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.090
We don't have time to stop.

24:00.134 --> 24:01.788
We've got to strategize
a way to fight back.

24:01.831 --> 24:04.181
Hey, Mac, I'm back.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.532
Looks like they have fewer
tracking dots on the map

24:06.575 --> 24:08.882
and your priority target dots
have disappeared.

24:08.925 --> 24:11.145
MacGYVER:
Hiding out in the woods is not
a long-term solution.

24:11.188 --> 24:13.321
We, uh, we need to go
on the offensive.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.931
But how?

24:14.975 --> 24:17.586
Well, we need to locate
the central receiver hub

24:17.630 --> 24:19.719
that's communicating with all
the other cell phone towers.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.329
RILEY: It would be
in the middle of the city

24:21.372 --> 24:23.636
in a tower or a spire

24:23.679 --> 24:25.551
the same altitude
as the cell towers.

24:25.594 --> 24:27.640
I'll get techs on it and let
you know when we find it.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.338
What do we do when we
find that location?

24:30.381 --> 24:31.948
Destroy the receiver?

24:31.992 --> 24:34.168
No, uh, as long as these things
are in our bodies,

24:34.211 --> 24:35.648
we can be found.

24:35.691 --> 24:38.520
So, best way to ensure
our freedom would be to

24:38.564 --> 24:41.262
hack the central hub
and send a deactivate command

24:41.305 --> 24:42.524
to all the nano-trackers.

24:42.568 --> 24:43.917
The only person
that knows that command

24:43.960 --> 24:45.179
is the one who designed it.

24:45.222 --> 24:46.789
BOZER:
So if we can get that command,

24:46.833 --> 24:49.618
we may be able to shut down
the nano-trackers for good.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.838
Yes, I always suspected
that Silas built

24:51.881 --> 24:54.667
his microchips
with a sunset sequence.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.277
A unique passcode
that would, uh,

24:56.320 --> 24:58.845
render his
microchips inert,

24:58.888 --> 25:01.543
so he could destroy
them remotely,

25:01.587 --> 25:03.893
hiding evidence
of his activities.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.678
If these trackers evolved
from his tech,

25:05.721 --> 25:08.115
they should respond
to the same shutdown code.

25:10.465 --> 25:11.771
We'll get that code.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.381
I got this.

25:13.424 --> 25:16.384
As I stated before,
the next solution I give you

25:16.427 --> 25:18.473
won't be so easy to earn.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.909
For every question
you answer truthfully,

25:19.953 --> 25:21.911
I'll answer one of yours...
truthfully.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.044
I haven't revealed
anything in years.

25:24.087 --> 25:27.003
What makes you think
I'll talk now?

25:32.313 --> 25:34.533
Did you just build
a smokeless fire pit?

25:34.576 --> 25:36.447
Heat without giving up
our location.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.233
You taught me
how to do this, remember?

25:39.276 --> 25:41.452
I do remember, but
you were actually

25:41.496 --> 25:42.758
listening during
wilderness training?

25:42.802 --> 25:44.673
I'm always listening
to you, Mac.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.853
Hey, about what we
were talking about.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.073
Mac, we don't haveto talk about it.I know what you said, but...

25:53.116 --> 25:54.944
And I already gave you
your answer.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.467
Last I checked,

25:56.511 --> 25:58.731
you were about
to propose to Desi, so...

25:58.774 --> 26:00.602
why'd you show up at my door?

26:01.647 --> 26:03.170
What is it you want, Mac?

26:03.213 --> 26:05.694
[buzzing overhead]

26:07.043 --> 26:09.263
What is that?

26:09.306 --> 26:11.178
Sounds like a drone.
Probably looking for us.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.962
So much for being safe
in the woods-- we need

26:13.006 --> 26:14.964
to get out of here, wait
for Bozer's instructions.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.792
I'm sure you guys can
find a use for this.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.446
Also, this will be
for communication.

26:18.489 --> 26:20.100
What are you going to do?

26:20.143 --> 26:20.927
MacGYVER:
Improvise.

26:26.236 --> 26:29.152
Mac, Riley, care to tell me why
you're back on the surveillance

26:29.196 --> 26:30.632
grid running towards
what appears to be

26:30.676 --> 26:32.678
a flying cell tower?[buzzing overhead]

26:32.721 --> 26:34.462
Technically,
these are surveillance drones

26:34.505 --> 26:35.942
equipped with IMEI catchers.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.378
Yeah, we needed them
to follow us so that

26:37.421 --> 26:39.989
we could subtly draw them away
from the protesters.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.687
Looks like your plan was
a major success.

26:41.730 --> 26:42.949
Is there a part two?

26:42.992 --> 26:44.646
Keep running
until Taylor tells us

26:44.690 --> 26:46.039
how to deactivate
the trackers.

26:46.082 --> 26:47.475
SILAS: All these years,
I've always wanted to know.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.608
How did you get on to me?

26:49.651 --> 26:52.219
I saw you as an equal,
treated you with respect.

26:52.262 --> 26:53.655
Also, I recognized
that behavior.

26:53.699 --> 26:57.224
Predators groom allies...

26:57.267 --> 26:58.791
the same way they groom victims.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.662
Sorry to interrupt,
but there's a ticking clock

27:00.706 --> 27:02.185
on disabling
Mac and Riley's trackers.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.753
You got to hustle.Right, enough of these games.

27:04.797 --> 27:07.103
I want to know
how to disable these trackers.

27:07.147 --> 27:09.932
And I know exactly what
you've been dying to ask me.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.978
So just ask me.

27:12.021 --> 27:13.240
[chains rattle]

27:15.111 --> 27:17.984
Did you ever find your father?

27:19.550 --> 27:21.465
Yes.

27:21.509 --> 27:24.294
I eventually
tracked him down, but

27:24.338 --> 27:25.992
he didn't want
a relationship with me.

27:26.035 --> 27:28.211
So...

27:28.255 --> 27:30.997
I gave up trying to...
mend that bridge.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.389
Right, my turn.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.087
How do I disable the trackers?

27:35.610 --> 27:39.309
Run a low-voltage current
through the specimens,

27:39.353 --> 27:42.399
override the circuitry
and render them inert.

27:42.443 --> 27:45.533
Let me guess, that would
actually kill my agents.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.840
Nice try, old chap.

27:48.971 --> 27:51.234
Silas was never going
to give me the truth.

27:51.278 --> 27:53.715
When he found out this was
about my agents in the field,

27:53.759 --> 27:55.978
he wanted to hurt them
in order to hurt me.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.850
So I laid a little trap for him,

27:57.893 --> 27:59.982
and by telling us
an action and a reaction...

28:00.026 --> 28:02.028
That gives us a constant

28:02.071 --> 28:03.812
that we can extrapolate
from-- that's genius.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.771
Angus, do any
of your shutdown theories

28:05.814 --> 28:08.730
also explain
why a low-voltage current

28:08.774 --> 28:09.862
would harm you?

28:09.905 --> 28:10.993
One would, yes.

28:11.037 --> 28:13.039
If the nano-trackers
were thermoelectric.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.693
RILEY: Thermoelectric devices
generate their power

28:14.736 --> 28:15.955
from a temperature differential.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.478
Yes, exactly, but...

28:17.521 --> 28:19.175
in this case, it's the
difference between

28:19.219 --> 28:21.351
internal body heat and
external skin temperature,

28:21.395 --> 28:23.353
but when electricity
is introduced

28:23.397 --> 28:25.312
into a thermoelectric system,
it raises the heat differential,

28:25.355 --> 28:26.792
which would have given
us heatstroke.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.402
RILEY:
So what's the real play?

28:29.925 --> 28:31.753
I think I just
figured out a way

28:31.797 --> 28:34.103
to disable
the nano-trackers temporarily.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.627
We got to take
off our clothes.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.107
We got to what?

28:39.935 --> 28:41.632
Wait, y'all about to get naked?

28:41.676 --> 28:44.157
DESI:
Bozer, I'm not gonna make exfil!

28:45.201 --> 28:46.550
[alarm sounding]

28:48.814 --> 28:50.076
Bozer!

28:50.119 --> 28:51.904
I think this is
the end of the line for me!

28:52.731 --> 28:54.689
[grunting]

28:58.780 --> 29:00.913
I just want to let you know

29:00.956 --> 29:03.829
it's been an honor...BOZER:
Save the speech.

29:03.872 --> 29:05.004
You exfil's coming to you.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.353
What? How?

29:09.312 --> 29:10.966
That tac team I rerouted?

29:11.010 --> 29:12.838
They specialize
in air-to-air operations.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.847
Thanks for the parachute.

29:26.460 --> 29:29.289
You are not gonna believe
the day I had.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.247
BOZER:
I love air-to-air rescues.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.205
Excuse me?

29:32.248 --> 29:33.728
I'm so sorry, but...

29:33.772 --> 29:35.382
Acting Director Bozer, let me

29:35.425 --> 29:37.036
be quick
because my time

29:37.079 --> 29:38.689
has already been wasted.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.561
The Phoenix will not
get the contracts.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.781
A car is en route
to take me to the airport.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.957
In rush hour? That's
gonna take forever.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.393
Why don't you use
the Phoenix chopper?

29:46.436 --> 29:48.569
Skip all that traffic.
It's the least we could do.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.745
[scoffs] I suppose there's
no need to waste

29:50.789 --> 29:52.138
more time sitting in traffic.

29:52.181 --> 29:54.749
Absolutely. Here, sit down.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.533
I'll let you know as soon
as it's fueled up.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.710
Anything I can get you
while you wait?

30:01.234 --> 30:03.453
No. You good?

30:04.933 --> 30:06.413
Our bodies are now
in cold shock.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.241
Causing neuromuscular cooling is

30:08.284 --> 30:10.591
the first step to inversing

a blood sample

41:08.335 --> 41:10.206
before our bodies break down
the nano-trackers, so...

41:11.686 --> 41:14.428
No choice. Sorry.All right.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.214
[winces]

41:21.130 --> 41:23.002
Mac, um...

41:24.656 --> 41:28.050
I made my feelings
go away because...

41:28.094 --> 41:30.618
what we have at the Phoenix
is-is too important.

41:32.881 --> 41:37.059
And honestly, I don't want
to lose your friendship.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.977
I'm always gonna have your back.

41:43.675 --> 41:44.980
You mean the world to me.

41:45.024 --> 41:47.592
And I trust you.

41:47.635 --> 41:49.550
Implicitly.

41:49.594 --> 41:54.033
So, I guess
keep the door closed.

41:54.076 --> 41:56.818
Yeah.

41:56.862 --> 41:58.733
[quietly]:
That's for you.

41:58.777 --> 42:00.430
You and Desi
seem happy together.

42:00.474 --> 42:03.564
When you're not
keeping things from her.

42:03.608 --> 42:06.567
She keeps secrets
from me, too.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.395
Yeah.

42:08.438 --> 42:11.224
Though she did just tell me
her mission was a success.

42:11.267 --> 42:15.576
So, baby steps.
And yeah, you're right.

42:15.620 --> 42:16.621
We are happy.

42:18.623 --> 42:21.800
Well, it's only fair I get
to stab you with a needle next.

42:21.843 --> 42:24.498
I-I-- Yes, my time will come,
but I want to get a look

42:24.542 --> 42:26.544
at these things.

42:28.197 --> 42:30.243
♪

42:31.679 --> 42:33.594
What?

42:33.638 --> 42:35.335
How...?

42:35.378 --> 42:36.554
What is it?

42:45.954 --> 42:47.434
RILEY:
Are those Chinese numbers?

42:47.477 --> 42:48.609
Yes.

42:48.653 --> 42:51.090
But the real question is:

42:51.133 --> 42:52.439
what the hell
are they doing on this tech?
