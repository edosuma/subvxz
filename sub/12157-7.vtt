WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:08.008
EVE, PUT THE TURKEY DOWN.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.378
PLEASE, MOM,
LET ME TOSS THIS.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.912
WE'VE BEEN PICKING
THESE BONES FOR A WEEK.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.881
LET THE POOR BASTARD
REST IN PEACE.

00:13.914 --> 00:17.585
HEY, I SPENT DAYS PREPARING
A THANKSGIVING FEAST

00:17.618 --> 00:21.089
FOR 26 PEOPLE. I'VE EARNED
THE RIGHT TO PHONE IT IN.

00:22.623 --> 00:23.591
YOU AREN'T KIDDING.

00:23.624 --> 00:27.395
TONIGHT'S DINNER
WAS 1-800-CRAP.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.897
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THE PRESENTS?

00:29.930 --> 00:32.666
OH, I'M SENDING THEM
TO RELATIVES, SWEETIE.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.901
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:33.934 --> 00:36.036
GRANDMA HAS GOT A JILLION
CHRISTMAS CARDS TO SEND,

00:36.070 --> 00:37.271
AND IT WOULD BE
REALLY HELPFUL

00:37.305 --> 00:39.340
IF YOU WOULD TAKE
THESE REINDEER STAMPS,

00:39.373 --> 00:41.409
AND PUT THEM ON--
NO, THANK YOU.

00:41.442 --> 00:45.579
OH, SURE. NO ONE WANTS TO KNOW
HOW THE SAUSAGE IS MADE.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.115
WHOA! HEY!
HOLD ON, LITTLE MAN.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.382
WATCH OUT. YOUR HEAD IS

00:48.416 --> 00:51.018
AT A VERY DANGEROUS HEIGHT
RIGHT NOW.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.221
SO?
I HEARD THERE WAS SAUSAGE.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.256
ARE WE FINALLY DONE
WITH THAT STUPID TURKEY?

00:55.289 --> 00:57.725
NOPE.
MOM'S STILL PHONING IT IN.

00:57.758 --> 01:01.028
COME ON.
IT'S A HOLIDAY LOGJAM, MIKE.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.030
HALLOWEEN, THANKSGIVING,
CHRISTMAS.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.065
AND SURVIVING ALL THAT
IS THE REAL REASON

01:05.099 --> 01:08.068
I ALLOW MYSELF TO BE
OVER-SERVED NEW YEAR'S EVE.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.238
YOU GOTTA LEARN
TO PACE YOURSELF, HONEY.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.206
THEN YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
GET TO SEE THAT BALL DROP.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.374
(chuckles)

01:13.407 --> 01:16.144
BEEN WATCHING 'EM DROP
FOR YEARS, DEAR.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.182
I'VE BEEN WATCHING
STUFF DROP, TOO.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.653
TOUCHE.
HONEY, COME HERE.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.555
YOU WANNA HELP ME
WITH SOME OF THIS STUFF?

01:27.588 --> 01:28.989
I'VE GOT ALL THIS--
YEAH, I'M SORRY
I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND MORE.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.391
IT'S BEEN INSANE
AT THE STORE.
YEAH?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.426
OBAMA'S ECONOMY'S
HELPING OUT.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.094
LOT OF PEOPLE CAMPING
THESE DAYS.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.897
MOSTLY UNDER BRIDGES.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.501
HEY, MANDY, COME HERE, HONEY.
I NEED SOME HELP WITH CHRISTMAS.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.069
YEAH, I'M ALREADY
DOING MY PART

01:42.102 --> 01:44.238
BY GOING AWAY TO CANCUN
WITH ALL MY FRIENDS.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.906
PLUS I PRE-REGISTERED
FOR ALL MY GIFTS ONLINE.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.176
HEY--
OOH, AND IF YOU ORDER TODAY,
FREE SHIPPING.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.278
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.113
KRIS, HE'S WITH
YOUR FOLKS ALL THE TIME.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.348
HE'S NEVER EVEN
MET MY PARENTS.

01:54.382 --> 01:57.117
WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TIME
I SAY "NO," YOU DON'T LISTEN?

01:57.151 --> 01:59.587
THERE'S A WINDOW
INTO HOW WE GOT BOYD.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.088
(mouths words)

02:01.121 --> 02:03.157
RYAN WANTS TO TAKE BOYD
AWAY FOR THE HOLIDAYS...

02:03.191 --> 02:04.492
TO CANADA.

02:04.525 --> 02:07.027
WHAT? NO, NO, NO, NO. NO.
NOT--NOT CHRISTMAS.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.097
CHRISTMAS IS A TIME
FOR FAMILY, LOVE, AND AFFECTION.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.166
SO SCREW YOU.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.603
MY FOLKS HAVE A BIG PLACE
UP IN WINNIPEG

02:15.636 --> 02:16.604
WITH A FROZEN POND OUT BACK.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.038
I CAN TEACH BOYD
HOW TO SKATE.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.441
WHAT IF BOYD CRACKS
HIS HEAD OPEN ON THE ICE?

02:20.474 --> 02:22.876
CANADA. FREE HEALTH CARE.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.945
NO, HE'S GONNA HAVE
A TRADITIONAL,

02:24.978 --> 02:26.380
GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED
AMERICAN CHRISTMAS

02:26.414 --> 02:28.216
WHILE HE'S STILL
YOUNG ENOUGH TO ENJOY IT,

02:28.249 --> 02:29.317
NOT ALL JADED AND GREEDY
LIKE THIS CREW.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.319
HEY. I'M NOT GREEDY.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.153
I JUST BELIEVE THE BABY JESUS

02:33.187 --> 02:35.155
WOULD WANT ME
TO HAVE AN iPad.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.666
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.201
HERE YOU GO.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.069
(rips)

02:51.272 --> 02:53.541
SORRY. THAT'S PROBABLY
MY FAULT.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.043
I'LL WRAP THAT FOR YOU.
COME BACK IN A BIT.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.045
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

02:58.078 --> 03:02.149
KYLE, YOU GOTTA REMEMBER--
WITH TAPE, SHINY SIDE UP,

03:02.182 --> 03:04.552
STICKY SIDE DOWN.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.587
VANESSA'S BEEN REALLY
WORKING HARD.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.188
I WANNA GET HER SOMETHING
SPECIAL FOR CHRISTMAS,

03:08.222 --> 03:09.823
LET HER KNOW THAT SHE'S
REALLY APPRECIATED.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.359
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.228
PERFECT GIFT. ALL RIGHT.
YOU HAVE A DOG, RIGHT?

03:14.262 --> 03:16.196
MUFFIN?
VANESSA LOVES THIS DOG?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.164
WE ALL DO.
OKAY, GOOD.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.333
GO HOME, KIDNAP THE DOG.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.603
YEAH. (mutters) JUST--
JUST HIDE IT SOMEWHERE.

03:22.636 --> 03:28.041
NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT--
WRITE DOWN WHERE YOU HID IT.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.443
VANESSA'S GONNA THINK
IT'S LOST.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.412
SHE'S DISTRAUGHT. SHE PUTS UP
SIGNS ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.746
ED.
ALL RIGHT?
AT THE RIGHT TIME...

03:32.780 --> 03:34.915
ED.
YOU FIND MUFFIN, ALL RIGHT?

03:34.948 --> 03:37.618
YOU WRAP A BIG--WRAP A BIG
RED BOW AROUND HIS NECK,

03:37.651 --> 03:41.121
AND IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE.
YOU'RE A HERO. THAT'S IT.

03:41.154 --> 03:44.858
PLEASE, GOD, TELL ME
YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.127
MY ONLY MISTAKE WAS DOING IT
TWICE WITH THE SAME WIFE.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.630
HEY. HI. HI.
HI, BABY.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.399
HI, HONEY. HOW--
HELLO, MY DEAR.
HEY, ED, HOW ARE YOU?

03:51.432 --> 03:53.133
HOW ARE YOU? GOOD.
UH, SO I WAS JUST
OUT SHOPPING.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.302
I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY

03:54.335 --> 03:55.769
AND SEE THAT SLED
YOU PICKED OUT FOR BOYD.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.271
OH, OH, OH, IT'S
ON DISPLAY HERE. COME ON.
YEAH? ALL RIGHT.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.106
YEAH, MUST BE TOUGH, HUH?
BEING OUT THERE ALL DAY,

03:59.139 --> 04:01.275
AWAY FROM
YOUR BELOVED DOGGIE, HMM?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.644
(mouths words)

04:03.677 --> 04:06.113
I'M JUST PLANTING THE SEED!
(speaks indistinctly)

04:06.146 --> 04:08.982
HEY, IF MR. ALZATE COMES BY,
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING HIM

04:09.016 --> 04:10.451
THAT I TAUGHT YOU
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW?

04:10.484 --> 04:11.752
(rips)

04:11.785 --> 04:12.753
OH, AND DO YOU MIND

04:12.786 --> 04:15.255
TEACHING ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW?

04:15.289 --> 04:17.291
KYLE, THIS CAN'T BE TAUGHT.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.226
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
IT'S SO SIMPLE,

04:19.259 --> 04:21.094
IT LITERALLY CANNOT
BE TAUGHT.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.332
IT'S POLYCARBONATE-BASED.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.799
IT'S GOT A NYLON SEAT
FOR THE KID.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.501
STEERABLE.
GERMAN ENGINEERING.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.637
IT'S ABSOLUTELY
THE COOLEST THING.
HMM.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.305
"TODES SCHLITTER"?

04:31.339 --> 04:32.473
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

04:32.506 --> 04:35.242
"DEATH SLED."

04:35.275 --> 04:37.177
I'M GONNA KEEP LOOKING.
ALL RIGHT.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.946
THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.749
BUT WHATEVER YOU GET,
WE'RE GONNA BUY HERE IN AMERICA.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.983
I CAN'T BELIEVE RYAN THOUGHT

04:43.016 --> 04:45.653
WE'D LET HIM...
TAKE BOYD TO CANADA?

04:45.686 --> 04:48.188
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT WAS SOMETHIN', HUH?

04:48.221 --> 04:49.156
BOY, WASN'T IT?
YEAH.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.958
WHAT?

04:50.991 --> 04:53.861
OH, NO, NOTHING.
JUST, UM...

04:53.894 --> 04:56.530
WHEN, UH, WHEN RYAN
ASKED IF HE COULD TAKE BOYD,

04:56.564 --> 04:59.132
THERE WAS A TINY
LITTLE PART OF ME

04:59.166 --> 05:02.135
THAT KIND OF WENT, "YAY!"

05:02.169 --> 05:04.505
WH... REALLY?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.374
JUST A NICE,
NO-FUSS CHRISTMAS.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.476
YOU--HONEY, YOU KNOW THIS
HAPPENS TO YOU EVERY YEAR.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.810
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE
OUT OF SORTS.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.178
AS SOON AS YOU HEAR
YOUR FAVORITE SONG,

05:11.211 --> 05:12.279
"THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY"--

05:12.312 --> 05:14.181
* PA RUM PA PUM PUM

05:14.214 --> 05:15.516
YOU KNOW, YOU GET IT BACK.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.518
YEAH, MAYBE. MAYBE.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.888
I JUST KEEP THINKING
ABOUT HOW SIMPLE CHRISTMAS WAS

05:20.921 --> 05:23.457
WHEN IT WAS JUST
YOU AND ME, YOU KNOW?

05:23.491 --> 05:26.293
A LITTLE APARTMENT
ON LEETSDALE DRIVE, REMEMBER?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.728
YEAH, I DO. SURE, I DO.
YEAH.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.329
WE'D SLEEP IN,
THEN GO TO CHURCH.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.065
I'D SLEEP IN CHURCH.
YEAH. (sighs)

05:32.099 --> 05:35.035
GOD, IT WAS SO QUIET,
WE COULD HEAR

05:35.068 --> 05:38.171
WHEN THE UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR
FELL TO THE FLOOR.
YEAH.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.508
CHRISTMAS STROKE.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.543
"OH!" (imitates thud)

05:42.576 --> 05:44.378
(laughs)
AND REMEMBER?

05:44.412 --> 05:45.813
THE E.M.S. GUYS
SHOWED UP IN SANTA HATS.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.248
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
INAPPROPRIATE. I REALLY DID.
YEAH.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.384
GOOD TIMES. GOOD TIMES.
YEAH, GOOD TIMES, YEAH.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.353
SO YOU, UH, WANNA DO
CHRISTMAS WITHOUT THE KIDS?

05:53.387 --> 05:55.556
UH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.857
I CAN'T EVEN
IMAGINE CHRISTMAS

05:56.890 --> 05:59.226
WITHOUT KRISTIN AND MANDY
AND EVE AND BOYD, AND...

05:59.259 --> 06:00.360
BOYD, RIGHT, RIGHT.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.163
YEAH. JUST... THE HOUSE
WOULD BE SO EMPTY.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.532
(clicks tongue)
QUIET. YEAH.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.169
(clicks tongue)

06:09.202 --> 06:11.271
YEAH, I MEAN, IF YOU WERE UNDER
THE TREE, I'D UNWRAP YOU.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.040
(both laugh)

06:13.073 --> 06:16.009
I'M GONNA PUT YOU
ON THE "NAUGHTY" LIST.
(laughs)

06:16.043 --> 06:18.378
(laughs) OH...
OKAY. THAT'D BE FUN, YEAH.
THAT'D BE--

06:18.412 --> 06:20.213
WELL, WE GOT
A LITTLE, UH...
YEAH.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.282
OH. HONEY...

06:22.315 --> 06:23.283
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.418
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

06:24.452 --> 06:27.254
WELL, I GOTTA GO
WAIT IN LINE AT THE HAM STORE.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.459
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT'S CODE FOR, BUT I'M IN.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.067
(thud)

06:40.100 --> 06:42.436
FINALLY GIVING THAT BIRD
A RESPECTABLE SEND-OFF?

06:42.470 --> 06:44.805
I'VE GIVEN THIS BIRD
A RESPECTABLE SEND-OFF

06:44.838 --> 06:47.441
EVERY MORNING ABOUT 8:05.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.479
HEY, THANKS FOR SUPPORTING ME
WITH RYAN, BY THE WAY.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.813
SOME NERVE OF THAT GUY,

06:52.846 --> 06:54.648
THINKING HE COULD TAKE
BOYD OUT OF THE COUNTRY

06:54.682 --> 06:56.784
TO WANNABE-AMERICA
FOR CHRISTMAS.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.290
ON THE OTHER HAND,
MAYBE BOYD WOULD LIKE IT THERE.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.159
THEY GOT MOUNTIES,
THEY GOT MAPLE SYRUP,

07:06.193 --> 07:08.428
THEY GOT, UM... WELL...

07:11.599 --> 07:13.100
YOU CAN GOOGLE IT. I'M SURE
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF UP THERE

07:13.133 --> 07:14.267
THAT KIDS LIKE.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.169
I'M ALL FOR
THE VOGELSONS MEETING BOYD.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.906
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY IT HAS TO BE AT CHRISTMAS.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.808
YEAH, LET 'EM SPEND TIME
WITH THEIR OTHER GRANDCHILDREN.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.342
NO, RYAN'S AN ONLY CHILD.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.744
REALLY?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.480
SO THEY LOOKED AT HIM
AFTER HE WAS BORN AND SAID,

07:26.514 --> 07:29.049
"CAN'T DO BETTER
THAN THAT, EH?"

07:32.452 --> 07:34.321
WAIT, SHOULD I--
SHOULD I HAVE LET BOYD GO?

07:34.354 --> 07:35.322
GO WHERE?

07:35.355 --> 07:37.157
OH, KRIS IS HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS

07:37.190 --> 07:38.526
ABOUT BOYD GOING TO CANADA.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.193
WHAT KIND OF MOM
WOULD THAT MAKE ME?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.029
NOT BEING
WITH MY KID AT CHRISTMAS?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.798
UM, IT'S, UH,
NOT THE MOST TERRIBLE THING

07:44.832 --> 07:46.433
I'VE EVER... HEARD.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.269
YEAH. IF THERE'S SOME WAY
THAT YOU COULD DO IT

07:49.302 --> 07:51.004
WHERE YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO BE SEPARATED,

07:51.038 --> 07:54.742
YOU COULD, UH...
WELL, YOU COULD GO WITH HIM.

07:56.977 --> 07:57.945
SERIOUSLY?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.479
GOT PLENTY OF ROOM UP THERE.

07:59.513 --> 08:03.283
CANADIANS DON'T SHUT UP
ABOUT THEIR WIDE-OPEN SPACES.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.052
NO, I DON'T WANT TO
RUIN YOUR GUYS' CHRISTMAS.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.520
OH, HEY, COME ON.
IT'S GONNA BE QUIET,

08:06.554 --> 08:08.689
BUT WE'RE GONNA BE FINE HERE.
WE REALLY WILL.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.624
(mouths word)

08:10.658 --> 08:12.860
ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I'LL GO
CHECK INTO SOME FLIGHTS.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.394
YEAH, CHECK--
YEAH, SURE, JUST CHECK IN.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.329
SEE HOW--YEAH, THAT'D BE
ALL RIGHT, RIGHT, HONEY?

08:16.363 --> 08:17.831
SHOULD BE... (mouths words)

08:17.865 --> 08:20.400
(both laughing)

08:20.433 --> 08:22.536
(lowered voice) YOU'RE DOING IT!
YOU'RE DOING IT!
QUIET! QUIET! QUIET!

08:22.570 --> 08:26.373
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ACTUALLY
BUMPING OFF THE KIDS.
(whispers) QUIET.

08:26.406 --> 08:29.242
(normal voice) MERRY CHRISTMAS.
IT'S YOUR PRESENT.
OHH!

08:29.276 --> 08:30.844
(normal voice) NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS NOT GOOD.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.813
HONEY--
THIS IS WRONG. I DON'T
FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.748
I DON'T WANT TO--
HONEY, YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.316
WE GOT MANDY
TAKEN CARE OF.
YEAH.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.551
KRISTIN AND BOYD.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.587
JUST GOT ONE MORE KID
TO GET RID OF.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.190
EVE.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.558
NO NAMES. NO NAMES.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.593
THE LESS YOU KNOW,
THE BETTER.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.060
BUT SHE'S GONNA
BE A PROBLEM.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.528
ALL RIGHT, LET ME THINK OF
SOMETHING. HOLD ON A SECOND.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.730
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE. HO--

08:49.763 --> 08:51.932
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THIS FROM ME,
BUT....

08:51.965 --> 08:53.701
THE GOLDSTEINS INVITED EVE

08:53.734 --> 08:55.569
TO GO WITH THEM TO ASPEN
OVER THE HOLIDAYS,

08:55.603 --> 09:00.273
BUT SOMEO INSISTED THAT SHE
NEEDED TO WORK AT OUTDOOR MAN.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.875
I KNOW SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS SOMEBODY

09:01.909 --> 09:03.744
WHO CAN MAKE THAT GO AWAY.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.779
(chuckles)

09:05.813 --> 09:07.080
NO MUSS, NO FUSS?

09:07.114 --> 09:09.249
LIKE IT NEVER EVEN HAPPENED.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.688
(Kyle) HEY, MR. B.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.689
JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW,

09:15.723 --> 09:17.390
I FIRED EVE
LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.
OH.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.259
SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT WELL.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.061
SHE SAID SOME THINGS.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.663
SCARY THINGS.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.433
WOULD YOU MIND
WALKING ME TO MY CAR LATER?

09:29.069 --> 09:32.539
MIKE, I'VE DONE
A TERRIBLE THING.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.074
WHAT'S UP, ED?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.542
UH, KYLE, CLOSE THE DOOR.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.745
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH...

09:37.778 --> 09:39.647
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

09:39.680 --> 09:42.049
WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
MAY SICKEN YOU.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.819
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
KIDNAP MY DOG.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.289
NO. SWEAR ON YOUR LIFE
YOU'LL TELL NO ONE.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.058
YEAH, YEAH, NOTHIN'.
WHAT IS IT, ED?
NO--OKAY. OKAY.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.827
(plastic crackles)

10:01.969 --> 10:04.504
YOU SHOT A BALD EAGLE.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.944
YEP. THAT'S HIM,
ALL RIGHT.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.080
OH...
I'M SO ASHAMED

10:13.113 --> 10:15.916
FOR THE CRIME I'VE COMMITTED
AGAINST MY COUNTRY.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.485
ON THE OTHER HAND,
I BAGGED A FRIGGIN' EAGLE.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.921
GOOD GOIN', ED.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.490
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I HAD THE TURKEY IN MY SIGHTS.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.125
I WAS ABOUT TO
SQUEEZE OFF A SHOT

10:25.158 --> 10:27.027
WITH MY S20 TURKEY THUMPER

10:27.060 --> 10:30.363
WHEN THIS...
BALD IDIOT SWOOPS IN.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.866
YOU'RE GONNA
GET FINED FOR THIS, ED.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.034
OH, THEY HAVE TO
CATCH ME FIRST.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.869
THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.071
IT'S GOT A GPS
AROUND ITS NECK.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.641
THEY'RE STILL
TAGGING EAGLES?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.143
THEY'RE NOT EVEN
ENDANGERED ANYMORE.

10:43.176 --> 10:46.079
UNLESS YOU'RE NEARBY
WITH A TURKEY THUMPER.

10:47.915 --> 10:48.982
YOU GOTTA
GET BALDY OUT OF HERE.

10:49.016 --> 10:49.983
I'M ON IT.
YEAH.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.218
COME WITH ME, MR. ALZATE.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.054
NO! (shouts indistinctly)

10:56.589 --> 10:59.092
HE'S TALKING
ABOUT THE EAGLE.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.196
WE HAVE TO DISPOSE OF THIS
PROPERLY.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.032
I KNOW A PLACE
WE CAN DUMP THIS.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.299
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
HOLD DOWN THE STORE.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.868
NO PROBLEM.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.569
ACTUALLY, ONCE ONE OF THESE
TOUCHES THE GROUND,

11:09.602 --> 11:11.404
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO
BURN IT?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.874
THAT'S FOR FLAGS,
YOU BONEHEAD.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.346
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO SHOT AN EAGLE.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.886
SO, MANDY'S OFF
TO MEXICO IN A WEEK.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.921
OH.
AND KRISTIN BOOKED CANADA.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.589
GONNA BE GONE
TILL THE 28th.
RIGHT.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.358
AND HOW DID IT GO
WITH FIRING EVE?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.198
REALLY WELL.
REALLY WELL.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.201
CHRISTMAS WITH THE GOLDSTEINS
IN ASPEN.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.104
THERE'S A HOLIDAY SPECIAL
YOU'LL NEVER SEE.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.105
THANK YOU, BABY.
(clink)

11:45.138 --> 11:47.074
(laughs)
(laughs)

11:47.107 --> 11:49.376
WE SUCCESSFULLY KILLED
OUR FAMILY CHRISTMAS.
YEAH.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.578
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S GONNA BE
JUST THE TWO OF US.
I KNOW.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.981
GOSH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BOUGHT A 20-POUND HAM.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.984
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.754
NO, YOU HAVE TO GO
TO CANCUN.
I AM NOT GOING.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.522
LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T GO,
NONE OF US CAN GO,

12:02.555 --> 12:04.057
AND I WILL HAVE TO
STAY HOME WITH MY FAMILY,

12:04.091 --> 12:06.193
WHICH WILL SUCK.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.394
I'LL HANDLE THIS.
YOU DON'T KNOW NUTTIN'.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.862
I DON'T KNOW NUTTIN'.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.131
GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS,
WHAT'S ALL THE YELLING ABOUT?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.632
OKAY, CHLOE'S BOYFRIEND STEVE
MADE OUT WITH LESLIE,

12:12.665 --> 12:14.034
WHO JUST BROKE UP WITH TREVOR
AT ZACH'S PARTY,

12:14.067 --> 12:15.535
SO NOW CHLOE DOESN'T WANNA
GO TO CANCUN,

12:15.568 --> 12:16.703
SO THE WHOLE TRIP
IS FALLING APART.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.138
WELL, THAT CAN'T
STOP YOU FROM GOING.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.572
CHLOE'S A DRAG.
YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT.

12:19.606 --> 12:20.573
I'M CHLOE.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.909
NOT CHLOE.

12:21.942 --> 12:25.145
I MEAN THE GIRL THAT CRIED
AT YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY

12:25.178 --> 12:26.980
'CAUSE SHE HAS
REAL FAT CALVES.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.416
THAT WAS ALSO ME.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.784
LISTEN, YOU'RE GETTING ME
OFF POINT HERE.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.052
THIS IS A GREAT TRIP.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.087
THERE MUST BE A SIMPLE,
EASY WAY TO FIX THIS.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.056
ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.257
LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT, STEVE--

12:37.290 --> 12:39.059
THE ONLY REASON
THAT YOU KISSED LESLIE

12:39.092 --> 12:40.260
WAS 'CAUSE YOU WERE
AT ZACH'S PARTY

12:40.293 --> 12:42.930
AND THIS GIRL CAMILLE
DARED YOU TO DO IT?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.164
NO. KATRINA DARED HIM

12:44.197 --> 12:45.966
BECAUSE SHE USED TO
HAVE A CRUSH ON STEVE.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.336
SO STEVE KISSED HER
BECAUSE HE WAS DARED,

12:49.369 --> 12:51.338
AND A REAL MAN
DOESN'T RUN FROM A DARE.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.406
SO WHAT YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE HERE IS,

12:53.440 --> 12:55.175
WHOO, A REAL MAN.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.578
WOW. I NEVER
THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.180
WHAT A SURPRISE.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.282
SO WE'RE GOIN' TO CANCUN?

13:02.315 --> 13:03.283
(Chloe) YES!
ALL RIGHT.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.684
THANK YOU, DAD.
(squeals)

13:06.153 --> 13:08.488
MAN, OH, MAN.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.824
WELL, WELL, WELL.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.260
YEAH. HEY, EVE.
WHAT'S UP?

13:13.293 --> 13:16.163
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO,
OLD MAN.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.465
SENDING KRISTIN
OFF TO THE FROZEN NORTH.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.500
KNOCKIN' OFF ME AND MANDY.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.669
YOU WANNA CLEAR OUT
THE HOUSE,

13:22.702 --> 13:25.839
SPEND SOME ALONE TIME WITH
YOUR LITTLE LADY FRIEND, HEH?

13:28.708 --> 13:32.846
HMM. WHAT IF I SUDDENLY
WASN'T IN THE MOOD FOR SKIING?

13:35.082 --> 13:37.317
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL PLAY ALONG.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.152
WHAT'LL IT TAKE
TO HAVE THIS GO AWAY?

13:39.186 --> 13:41.855
WELL... (sighs)
THERE'S A REPORT CARD COMIN'.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.357
I WANT YOU TO SIGN IT.
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

13:44.391 --> 13:47.360
WHY?
I SAID, NO QUESTIONS.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.996
IS THAT A DEAL?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.266
ALL RIGHT.

13:55.435 --> 13:59.139
LISTEN, HOW--HOW BAD
A REPORT CARD WAS IT?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.909
I'M GETTING A "D"
IN ART.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.143
A "D" IN ART?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.078
I-I CAN'T
DRAW HANDS, OKAY?

14:05.112 --> 14:07.180
THEY ALWAYS END UP
LOOKING LIKE A BUNCH OF BANANAS.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.349
WELL, WHAT DO
YOUR BANANAS LOOK LIKE?

14:09.382 --> 14:11.384
(scoffs) YOU DO NOT
WANNA KNOW.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.734
I'M TELLING YOU,
THEY'RE TRACKING US, I KNOW IT.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.070
I CAN'T GET CAUGHT.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.405
GUYS WITH LONG HAIR
AND SLENDER FRAMES--

14:32.439 --> 14:34.707
THEY DON'T DO WELL
IN THE CLINK.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.543
(thuds)

14:36.576 --> 14:37.677
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.746
ED, DID WE HIT SOMETHING?

14:39.779 --> 14:43.550
WITH MY LUCK, I PROBABLY
RAN OVER UNCLE SAM.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.786
(thuds)

14:46.819 --> 14:49.056
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

14:49.089 --> 14:50.057
(thuds)

14:50.090 --> 14:52.459
DO WE HAVE A FLAT?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.294
(loud thudding)

14:54.327 --> 14:55.862
NO, THAT'S NO FLAT.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.031
(thudding continues)

14:58.065 --> 15:00.567
I BETTER PULL OVER
AND SEE.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.605
BOYD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?
YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.607
YOU'RE PUTTING CHRISTMAS AWAY?

15:07.640 --> 15:10.710
WELL, HONEY,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HERE.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.545
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
ME AND GRANDPA.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.048
BUT I WANNA SEE YOU
ON CHRISTMAS.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.117
WELL, YOU'LL BE WITH YOUR
OTHER GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.119
IT WON'T BE THE SAME.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.588
NO. NO, IT WON'T, HONEY.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.992
WHAT'S, UH,
WHAT'S THAT YOU GOT THERE?

15:25.025 --> 15:27.194
IT'S MY NEW TOY.
AH.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.400
(instrumental
"Little Drummer Boy" playing)

15:33.433 --> 15:35.568
* PA RUM PA PUM PUM

15:35.602 --> 15:38.505
***

15:38.538 --> 15:40.840
(clicks tongue)
* BA RUM PA PUM PUM

15:40.873 --> 15:42.242
(sighs)

15:42.275 --> 15:45.512
***

15:45.545 --> 15:46.546
(car doors close)

15:49.482 --> 15:52.719
(thudding)

15:59.492 --> 16:01.128
POP THE TRUNK.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.696
COME ON. POP THE TRUNK.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.599
ON THREE.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.600
ONE...

16:07.634 --> 16:09.136
TWO...

16:09.169 --> 16:13.373
(screeching)

16:17.510 --> 16:20.713
WHY DOES THIS PLACE
SMELL LIKE AN AIR FRESHENER?

16:23.683 --> 16:25.285
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA
HANG THIS

16:25.318 --> 16:27.854
FROM YOUR MIRROR IN YOUR CAR.
NO.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.624
I HEARD THAT CHRISTMAS CAROL,
"THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY."

16:31.658 --> 16:33.860
IT JU--IT ALWAYS GETS TO ME.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.628
AND REMEMBER
THAT WONDERFUL VERSION

16:35.662 --> 16:37.164
WITH BING CROSBY
AND DAVID BOWIE?

16:37.197 --> 16:38.631
WARM CHRISTMAS MEMORIES.
YEAH.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.333
ZIGGY STARDUST SINGING
WITH A CROONER

16:40.367 --> 16:43.570
WHO KNOCKED HIS KIDS AROUND.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.406
SO YOU'VE COMPLETELY
CHANGED YOUR MIND?

16:46.439 --> 16:49.242
HONEY, I CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT
OF WAKING UP CHRISTMAS MORNING

16:49.276 --> 16:50.643
AND NOT HAVING
THE GIRLS HERE.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.845
AND BOYD.
BOYD.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.314
BOYD.
(exhales deeply)

16:54.347 --> 16:55.548
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.549
I GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF WORK TO DO THEN.

16:56.583 --> 16:57.984
BUT, HONEY, I MEAN,
THIS IS CRAZY.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.219
ISN'T IT TOO LATE?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.388
I EAT A COUPLE AIRFARES.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.591
MIKE, IF YOU CAN GET THE GIRLS
HERE FOR CHRISTMAS MORNING,

17:04.624 --> 17:07.560
IT WOULD BE THE MOST AMAZING
CHRISTMAS GIFT EVER,

17:07.594 --> 17:09.196
AND YOU CAN PUT THE BLAME
ALL ON ME.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.197
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL BE THE GRINCH.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.331
I'LL JUST TELL EVERYBODY

17:11.364 --> 17:14.000
THAT MY HEART
GREW THREE SIZES TODAY.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.568
AND IT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED,
ACTUALLY.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.704
I GOT THESE WEIRD PAINS
IN MY SHOULDER.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.572
I'M GONNA GET
SOME MORE LIGHTS.
ALL RIGHT.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.309
* PA RUM PA PUM PUM

17:23.610 --> 17:26.613
HEY, GIRLS, WOULD YOU COME
DOWN HERE A MINUTE, PLEASE?

17:26.646 --> 17:30.617
WELL, WELL, WELL.
OOH!

17:30.650 --> 17:32.585
WOW. HOW LONG YOU BEEN
STANDING THERE?

17:32.619 --> 17:35.755
LONG ENOUGH, MY FRIEND.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.358
SO, NOW YOU WANT EVERYONE
TO CANCEL THEIR PLANS.

17:38.391 --> 17:42.262
I SUPPOSE I COULD BE
PERSUADED... FOR A PRICE.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.531
NO MORE BLACKMAIL.
GIRLS, GET DOWN HERE!

17:44.564 --> 17:46.099
BUT YOU'RE HONORING
OUR EXISTING DEAL, CORRECT?

17:46.133 --> 17:49.269
JUST GET YOUR GRADES UP,
BANANA HANDS.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.737
WHAT'S GOING ON, DAD?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.572
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
FAMILY MEETING.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.708
THIS IS GONNA BE BAD NEWS,
BUT I WANT TO DOWNSIZE

17:55.742 --> 17:57.410
YOUR CHRISTMASES.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.613
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TRAVELING THIS CHRISTMAS.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.750
(flatly) BUT, HONEY,
THEY ALL MADE PLANS.

18:06.453 --> 18:09.422
LISTEN, I THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY
TO BE WITHOUT YOU GUYS.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.824
TRUTH IS, I DON'T WANT YOU
GONE OVER CHRISTMAS,

18:11.858 --> 18:13.226
'CAUSE WITHOUT YOU GUYS HERE,

18:13.260 --> 18:15.027
IT'S JUST TUESDAY
WITHOUT MAIL DELIVERY.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.231
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS, DAD.
I KNOW--

18:18.265 --> 18:19.499
I ALREADY BOUGHT
MY TICKETS...
I CAN--

18:19.532 --> 18:20.833
(singsongy)
AND THEY'RE REFUNDABLE!

18:20.867 --> 18:23.436
(normal voice) WHOO!

18:23.470 --> 18:25.838
OKAY, THERE IS NO GOOD WAY
TO GET TO WINNIPEG,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.575
AND--AND THEN ONCE
YOU'RE THERE, IT'S 23 BELOW.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.843
AND YOU'RE
IN FREAKIN' WINNIPEG.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.247
YEAH. I NEVER WANTED TO GO
WITH THE GOLDSTEINS.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.815
AND, DAD,
COULD I PLEASE HAVE

18:35.848 --> 18:37.817
MY WRAPPING JOB BACK
AT OUTDOOR MAN?
SURE.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.486
I'M TRYING TO SAVE UP
FOR THAT iPad,

18:39.519 --> 18:42.822
WHICH... I GUESS
I'M NOT GETTING?

18:46.826 --> 18:49.996
YOU NEVER KNOW.
I DO. YOU DON'T.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.864
NOW LOOK,

18:51.898 --> 18:53.766
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE UPSET
ABOUT CANCUN--
(inhales)

18:53.800 --> 18:55.868
IT'S JUST AS WELL, I THINK.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.171
CHLOE AND LESLIE ARE,
LIKE, FIGHTING AGAIN.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.207
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK
I'M DODGING A BULLET.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.442
IT'S MEXICO.
IT'S A HAIL OF BULLETS.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.311
AND BESIDES,

19:04.344 --> 19:06.979
I-I HAVE A WHOLE YEAR
TO USE THE TICKET.
SURE. SURE.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.648
SO MAYBE I'LL JUST, LIKE,
WAIT A FEW MONTHS

19:08.681 --> 19:11.751
UNTIL THE WHOLE, LIKE,
DRUG WAR THING BLOWS OVER.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.490
SO, THIS IS GREAT!

19:17.524 --> 19:19.226
I'M SO EXCITED. AND WE'LL HAVE
A DIFFERENT KIND OF CHRISTMAS,

19:19.259 --> 19:21.328
WHERE EVERYBODY PITCHES IN--
HELP WITH THE WRAPPING...

19:21.361 --> 19:23.896
COOKING. 'CAUSE I WANT YOUR MOM
TO BE THE CHRISTMAS QUEEN.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.732
STOP.
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
UP UNTIL NEW YEAR'S,

19:25.765 --> 19:27.567
WHICH, AFTER THAT, SHE'LL BE
OUT OF COMMISSION, ANYWAY,

19:27.600 --> 19:29.669
WITH THE...

19:31.671 --> 19:34.507
BUT I WANT TO SEE MOO-MAA
AND POPPY-POP.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.409
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE CALLS
RYAN'S PARENTS.

19:36.443 --> 19:37.877
I'M SORRY, BOYD.
NO, W-W-WAIT.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.546
WHY DON'T WE HAVE MOO-MOO
AND POO-POO--

19:39.579 --> 19:42.749
BUT--WH-WHY DON'T WE
HAVE THEM HERE FOR THE HOLIDAYS?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.517
REALLY?!
REALLY?

19:44.551 --> 19:46.919
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH. WHY NOT,
HONEY? JUST FOR A FEW DAYS.
W--

19:46.953 --> 19:48.655
THE MORE, THE MERRIER, RIGHT?

19:48.688 --> 19:51.023
(mouths words)

19:51.057 --> 19:53.926
A-ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
YOU HEARD YOUR MOM.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.395
LAST ONE TO CANCEL THEIR PLANS

19:55.428 --> 19:57.664
IS GONNA HAVE TO SHARE A ROOM
WITH THE OLD CANADIANS.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.066
(speaking at once)

20:00.099 --> 20:02.201
I'M AROUND IF YOU NEED
AIRLINE PLANS CHANGED.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.371
THANK YOU.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.672
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
MMM.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.007
MMM. (laughs)

20:12.044 --> 20:14.046
(chuckles) AND APPARENTLY,
HE WASN'T DEAD, THANK GOODNESS.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.383
JUST STUNNED,
AND--AND REALLY PISSED.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.251
IT WAS TERRIFYING.

20:18.285 --> 20:21.888
I'VE PLAYED ENOUGH "ANGRY BIRDS"
TO KNOW WHAT ONE LOOKS LIKE.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.290
(laughs)

20:25.325 --> 20:26.626
AND THEN HE SHOT UP
OUT OF THE TRUNK

20:26.659 --> 20:29.128
AND SOARED MAJESTICALLY
INTO THE NIGHT SKY.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.630
THAT--THAT EAGLE,

20:30.663 --> 20:32.865
JUST LIKE THE GREAT COUNTRY
HE REPRESENTS,

20:32.899 --> 20:34.367
JUST WHEN YOU THINK
HE'S DOWN,

20:34.401 --> 20:36.436
HE SOARS AGAIN,
HIGHER THAN EVER.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.271
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH ALTITUDE
THAT BIRD'S GONNA GET.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.606
THERE WAS A LOT OF BLOOD
IN THAT BAG.

20:39.639 --> 20:40.940
YEAH.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.208
OH, BY THE WAY,
DID YOU EVER FIND

20:42.241 --> 20:43.876
THAT PERFECT GIFT
FOR VANESSA?

20:43.910 --> 20:45.478
(chuckles) YEAH.
I DID YOUR DOG THING.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.213
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MUFFIN'S RIGHT HERE.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.716
NO, I DID IT
WITH THE KIDS.
WHAT?

20:49.749 --> 20:53.119
I MADE IT LOOK LIKE THE KIDS
DISAPPEARED FOR CHRISTMAS.

20:53.152 --> 20:55.322
(lowered voice) AND WHEN
VANESSA CHANGED HER MIND,

20:55.355 --> 20:58.558
I BROUGHT 'EM BACK MAGICALLY.
I LOOKED LIKE A BIG HERO.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.627
YEAH, BUT HOW COULD YOU BE
SO SURE THAT VANESSA

21:00.660 --> 21:03.062
WOULD CHANGE HER MIND
AND WANT EVERYBODY BACK?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.597
(normal voice) WELL, LET'S JUST
SAY THE FIX WAS IN.

21:04.631 --> 21:07.700
I GAVE LITTLE BOYD
HIS CHRISTMAS PRESENT EARLY.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.269
(click)

21:10.303 --> 21:13.606
("Little Drummer Boy" playing)

21:13.640 --> 21:14.974
THAT'S IT.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.809
MERRY CHRISTMAS, FELLAS.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.845
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
