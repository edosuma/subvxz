00:05.840 --> 00:08.740
Did my messenger fish
just tell you my evil plan?

00:09.210 --> 00:10.570
No.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.910
All right. This time, pay attention.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.810
Dear Mama, you'll be proud to know

00:15.950 --> 00:18.880
that after the 12-ball tournament
reveals the best young wizard,

00:19.020 --> 00:21.250
l will drain--

00:23.860 --> 00:26.190
Okay, maybe he did tell me.

00:27.530 --> 00:30.220
She is not my mother, you stupid fish.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.990
Hey, at least l didn't tell her
about Volcanoland.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.960
l never said anything
about Volcanoland.

00:36.100 --> 00:40.300
Well, you have to go to an undersea
volcano to drain a wizard's powers.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.240
And Volcanoland is the only--

00:46.980 --> 00:50.210
We have a problem.
You just heard my plan.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.150
And l love your plan.

00:53.290 --> 00:55.780
l think it'd be great for me
if Justin wins the tournament

00:55.920 --> 00:57.690
and you drain his powers.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.420
How so?

01:00.530 --> 01:02.050
Because without his powers,

01:02.200 --> 01:04.360
there's no way he'll end up being
the family wizard.

01:04.500 --> 01:05.560
l will.

01:05.700 --> 01:06.820
Well, of course there's Max,

01:06.970 --> 01:09.990
but he thinks
microwave popcorn's magic, so...

01:11.740 --> 01:14.570
Well, it looks like we're
on the same side.

01:14.710 --> 01:17.230
Care to seal it with a diabolical laugh?

01:17.380 --> 01:19.240
l'll try.

01:22.580 --> 01:25.070
Needs more bass.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.250
l thought l heard voices.

01:28.390 --> 01:32.080
Good evening, Headmaster Crumbs.
Just here with one of my prized students.

01:32.230 --> 01:33.720
Really?

01:33.860 --> 01:36.760
Alex Russo
is one of your prized students?

01:36.900 --> 01:40.020
All the other teachers say
she's remarkably slack.

01:40.170 --> 01:42.330
And you know how we feel
about slackers.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.490
We don't like slackers.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.470
Perhaps they don't know Ms. Russo
as well as l do.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.010
Well, then.

01:52.140 --> 01:54.940
Perhaps l should stick around
and get to know you too.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.740
Now, what are we talking about?

01:57.880 --> 01:59.110
Just girl talk.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.190
Bras and stuff.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.450
Oh, well, then, l've got to go.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.250 --> 03:04.340
Forget the Waverly Sub Station.
They use day-old bread.

03:04.750 --> 03:08.480
Beautiful people eat at The Salad Bowl.

03:08.890 --> 03:12.590
Lots of attractive women
eat salads these days.

03:16.460 --> 03:19.400
Look at this.
No wonder we had such a slow day.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.860
Excuse me.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.230
What do you think you're doing?

03:22.370 --> 03:26.240
lt's not Halloween, and you're a little
too old to be trick-or-treating anyway.

03:27.370 --> 03:30.100
lf you don't mind, why don't you
stand in front of the clown supply.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.400
l think you'd fit in better over there.

03:32.850 --> 03:35.280
l have to stand here
because l'm stealing your customers

03:35.410 --> 03:39.250
with my crisp lettuce
and crunchy cucumbers.

03:39.390 --> 03:40.440
You can't do that.

03:40.590 --> 03:43.350
That's what the hot-dog guy
in Washington Square Park said.

03:43.490 --> 03:46.930
Now he's holding the arrow toward
cheap furniture going out of business.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.430
So back off, meat eaters.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.350
Listen, you talking bowl of freak.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.470
You are not gonna steal our customers.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.300
Submarine sandwiches
have a long history in New York City.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.900
And l know New Yorkers,
and New Yorkers love sandwiches.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.940
They're not just gonna give them up
for tomatoes, carrots and--

04:05.080 --> 04:07.140
What are those, snails?

04:07.280 --> 04:09.180
They're porcini mushrooms.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.110
Oh, l love porcini mushrooms.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.610
Jerry.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.980
- l--
- Get inside.

04:16.160 --> 04:21.149
Okay, look, all we have to do is advertise
our shop like she advertises hers.

04:21.290 --> 04:24.690
Where are we gonna find a goof
to wear a ridiculous costume for us?

04:40.650 --> 04:42.310
lt's time for the serve-and-volley drill.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.250
You serve, l volley.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.320
You cry for mercy.

04:53.090 --> 04:55.490
l wasn't ready.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.460
Justin, can l talk to you?

04:58.600 --> 05:00.960
l need to practice.
l'm playing in the semifinals tomorrow.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.800
No, you're not. Dr. Evilini is gonna drain
the champion's powers at Volcanoland.

05:04.940 --> 05:07.800
- l can't let you win this thing.
- l'm sorry, volcano what?

05:07.940 --> 05:09.030
Her messenger fish told me.

05:09.180 --> 05:11.080
She wants to become
the most powerful wizard.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.910
So there's a volcano
and a messenger fish.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.420
We need to focus on Evilini.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.280
l don't know if you know, but she's evil.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.010
No. Her name's Evilini.

05:21.150 --> 05:23.590
And how much clearer could it be?

05:23.720 --> 05:24.880
Okay, if she was really evil,

05:25.020 --> 05:27.720
don't you think she would've changed
her name to Really-Friendly-ini

05:27.860 --> 05:32.160
or Nice-ini or Totally-Not-Evil-ini?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.120
All right, we're not getting anywhere.
You need to listen to me.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.570
This is exactly why l didn't want you
to come to Wiz Tech.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.070
Stop bothering me.
l need to focus and concentrate.

05:45.310 --> 05:47.510
lf l could focus, l would've hit those.

06:01.560 --> 06:05.330
There she is, working the streets.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.860
Go get her, Max.

06:07.670 --> 06:09.360
Max.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.960
Hey, how'd you get it
to smell like onions?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.800
Oh, that's you.

06:19.950 --> 06:22.350
Jerry, it needs more ventilation holes.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.610
That's why we went with Swiss cheese.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.950
Now, go get those customers.

06:28.090 --> 06:29.420
Yeah--

06:30.420 --> 06:31.750
Maxy, are you okay?

06:31.890 --> 06:32.950
Sorry, buddy.

06:33.090 --> 06:36.930
Just get me up
before the three-second rule kicks in.

06:42.370 --> 06:44.360
Get your Bronx-Strami.

06:44.500 --> 06:48.130
Central Pork Sandwich
right here at the Sub Station.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.410
Hey, it's working.

06:51.540 --> 06:52.840
That's my boy.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.810
Salads make you perky.

06:54.950 --> 06:56.940
Sandwiches make you sleepy.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.640
You know why people eat salad
with a roll?

06:59.790 --> 07:02.980
Because it makes a sandwich
in their stomachs.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.280
You have to eat sandwiches
with your hands.

07:05.420 --> 07:06.720
Like savages.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.720
Salads are un-American.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.290
All right. You won this lunch rush.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.220
But if you're here tomorrow,
you're gonna get it.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.230
l am scared of lettuce.

07:18.370 --> 07:21.070
lt's high in vitamins and fiber.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.240
Headmaster Crumbs, l need your help.

07:31.380 --> 07:33.870
What seems to be the problem?

07:37.960 --> 07:41.150
Dr. Evilini's gonna drain the 12-ball
champion's powers at Volcanoland.

07:41.290 --> 07:43.020
And l think my brother
may end up champion.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.220
You have to do something.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.520
l can't. My hands are tied.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.370
You don't believe me either?

07:48.500 --> 07:51.160
No, my hands are really tied.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.870
l lost a bet with Evilini.

07:55.010 --> 07:57.570
Professor Maloney and l
got into a beard contest,

07:57.710 --> 08:00.800
of which l had no business
being part of.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.180
Don't you see? That bet was a setup.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.840
Evilini has tied your hands
so you can't do anything about it.

08:05.990 --> 08:07.510
You may be onto something.

08:07.650 --> 08:11.210
But l can't confront Evilini.
She'd only deny it.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.190
lf you want to protect Justin,
it's up to you.

08:14.330 --> 08:16.660
Get him to back out of the tournament.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.130
l already tried, but once l mentioned
Volcanoland and the talking fish,

08:20.270 --> 08:21.670
he thought l was messing with him.

08:21.800 --> 08:25.240
Sounds like you need some hard evidence
to convince your brother.

08:25.370 --> 08:28.900
l suggest you knuckle down
and go to the library.

08:29.310 --> 08:30.940
Sure, l'll go to the library.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.400
Oh, really?

08:32.539 --> 08:34.840
- ls that the truth?
- Sure.

08:34.980 --> 08:38.580
Some are evil, some are kind
But now all must speak their mind

08:39.590 --> 08:41.520
l hate libraries. What am l saying?

08:41.650 --> 08:45.220
There's no way l'm going to a library.
What am l saying?

08:45.360 --> 08:49.160
l put a truth spell on you to see
if you're really on your way to help Justin

08:49.300 --> 08:51.790
or if you're just going to slack off again.

08:51.930 --> 08:54.690
l wanna help, but not at a boring library.

08:54.830 --> 08:57.430
Well, then go someplace
where it isn't boring.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.560
Like Volcanoland.

09:00.710 --> 09:01.970
How do l get to Volcanoland?

09:02.110 --> 09:03.600
l can't tell you that.

09:03.740 --> 09:06.710
- Then why did you tell me to go there?
- l didn't. l would never say that.

09:07.550 --> 09:08.600
l'm the headmaster.

09:08.750 --> 09:11.720
l can't send a student off campus
to Volcanoland.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.950
- What?
- You should never go to Volcanoland.

09:15.090 --> 09:17.020
lt could be dangerous.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.320
So just to be clear,
you want me to go to Volcanoland?

09:20.460 --> 09:22.720
l didn't say that.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.160
But you did say Volcanoland.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.760
l will admit to that.

09:35.110 --> 09:36.370
Nice.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.570
What's happening?

09:37.710 --> 09:38.900
Justin's fallen behind.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.510
Oh, good.
Maybe l don't have to go to Volcanoland.

09:41.650 --> 09:43.950
The only way he can win now
is if he hits the tattler.

09:44.380 --> 09:46.510
- The tattler?
- Yeah, it's an obscure rule.

09:46.650 --> 09:48.680
lf you hit the tattler,
it's an automatic win.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.690
But the tattler isn't even in here,
so there's no chance.

09:53.330 --> 09:55.020
- Yeah.
- There she is.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.220
What's she doing?

09:57.360 --> 10:00.060
She's tattling. She's the tattler.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.860
lt's obvious.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.070
He did it. He hit the tattler.

10:17.180 --> 10:20.980
l won. l'm going to the finals.

10:21.690 --> 10:23.380
Well played, Russo.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.650
lt's now down to you and Jerko.

10:26.290 --> 10:29.520
We'll soon find out
who's the most powerful young wizard.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.430
Oh, sorry. My cell phone.

10:34.570 --> 10:35.730
Hello, Mummy?

10:38.640 --> 10:41.970
Okay, l've got to get to Volcanoland.

10:53.450 --> 10:55.920
l guess it's just you, me and destiny.

10:56.050 --> 10:59.290
No, Destiny Johnson lost
in the third round.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.880
No, destiny, as in it's my destiny
to be a winner

11:03.100 --> 11:05.930
and your destiny
to always live in my shadow.

11:06.470 --> 11:08.490
Well, l'll see you in the finals, Jerk.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.890
How am l gonna get to Volcanoland?

11:14.040 --> 11:17.870
l'd mail myself, but all the mail
goes through Dr. Evilini, and she's evil.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.070
l work in the mailroom.
l could get around Evilini.

11:21.650 --> 11:25.140
Are you saying you could mail me from
the mailroom without Evilini knowing?

11:25.280 --> 11:28.450
l'm not saying that at all.

11:28.990 --> 11:31.150
What is it with you people
and your head nodding?

11:31.290 --> 11:33.420
Hey.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.790
Excuse me. l need some information
about the volcano.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.460
Fire away.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.670
We're encouraged to use
volcano terminology whenever we can.

11:50.580 --> 11:52.910
ls it true the volcano can drain wizards
of their powers?

11:53.310 --> 11:56.110
The majority of wizards
enjoy the natural wonder of the park

11:56.250 --> 11:59.550
and take a lot of pictures that they'll bore
their friends with when they get home.

11:59.690 --> 12:00.780
What about the others?

12:02.650 --> 12:05.590
They use the volcano
to drain wizards of their powers.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.590
That's a separate entrance fee.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.600
l have to prove this to my brother
before it's too late.

12:14.230 --> 12:16.060
Hey, could you come back
to school with me?

12:16.200 --> 12:19.400
What for? You got something bubbling?

12:19.540 --> 12:21.770
See what l did there?

12:23.280 --> 12:24.710
You're a volcano official.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.710
My brother always believes
people in uniform.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.470
lt's one of the many things about him
that annoy me.

12:29.620 --> 12:32.280
- Does it make you wanna erupt?
- Okay, now you're pushing it.

12:32.420 --> 12:33.880
- Does it block your flow?
- Stop it.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.820
- Does it make you wanna go molten?
- Don't.

12:35.950 --> 12:38.920
- Make you hot under the collar?
- Okay, officially ignoring you.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.520
- Alex, what are you doing? Who's she?
- Hello.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.560
l'm the lnformation Desk Lady
from Volcanoland.

12:53.910 --> 12:55.400
Go ahead, Justin. Ask her a question.

12:55.810 --> 12:56.870
Could l get one of those?

12:57.010 --> 12:59.840
- l like the fringe things on the shoulders.
- No.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.670
A question about Volcanoland.
Just tell him.

13:02.810 --> 13:06.150
At Volcanoland, more wizards
have been drained of their powers

13:06.290 --> 13:10.150
than at all of the 77 Wonders
of the Wizard World combined.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.150
Wizards come from near and far

13:12.290 --> 13:16.630
to witness its awesome
wizard-power-draining properties.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.200
Okay, so you weren't messing with me
about Volcanoland.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.990
But that doesn't mean Evilini's
taking me there to drain my powers.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.330
Dr. Evilini?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.490
Oh, she has a season pass
to the draining section.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.770
And she paid extra
so there's no blackout dates.

13:33.950 --> 13:35.240
l gotta quit the tournament.

13:35.380 --> 13:40.370
While l'm here, would you like to buy
an l Lava Volcanoland T-shirt?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.610
No, l don't wanna buy
an l Lava Volcanoland T-shirt

13:42.750 --> 13:45.350
because l don't lava Volcanoland.

13:47.930 --> 13:50.220
He didn't have to blow his top.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.850
Okay, l've had enough.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.290
You want me to go dormant?

13:53.430 --> 13:55.420
- Stop it.
- Okay.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.140
Try a salad right around the corner.

14:00.270 --> 14:02.570
Hey, lettucehead. Keep moving.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.870
l warned you
about coming back here, shorty.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.150
l don't wanna do this,
but you've given me no choice.

14:14.290 --> 14:17.590
lt's time for the salad
to get a little meat in it.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.020
Hey, Salad Bowl Girl.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.960
Remember me?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.000
Well, let me help you out.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.430
l'm the guy in the hot-dog suit.

14:33.570 --> 14:36.910
You thought you ran me out of the biz
with that furniture arrow.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.470
But l'm not going anywhere.

14:46.250 --> 14:50.350
Oh, look.
The rest of the combo meal is here.

14:50.790 --> 14:51.880
l can't believe it.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.080
l have always wanted to say this.

14:54.230 --> 14:56.060
l just never imagined it being this great.

14:57.460 --> 14:59.660
Food fight.

15:01.330 --> 15:02.730
Fight.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.270
Let me up. You can't do this.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.470
- Had enough?
- Yes, l've had enough.

15:16.980 --> 15:20.110
My lettuce was on the ground.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.740
l'm a walking health-code violation.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.460
- Thanks, guys.
- We got her. We got Salad Bowl Girl.

15:34.330 --> 15:37.060
Dr. Evilini.
Alex told me about your evil plan.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.870
- l'm not playing in the 12-ball final.
- Justin, Justin, Justin.

15:41.370 --> 15:43.170
l don't have an evil plan.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.440
Of course Alex doesn't want you to have
the 12-ball championship belt.

15:46.580 --> 15:49.510
That would make you a shoo-in
to be the one in your family

15:49.650 --> 15:51.340
to keep your wizard powers.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.610
There's a championship belt?

15:55.550 --> 15:57.250
Nice try, Evilini. l'm onto you.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.580
The Volcanoland lnformation Desk Lady
told me.

16:00.190 --> 16:05.460
She gave me a discount on my
Volcanoland park pass. l still hate her.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.590
The point is, l wanna keep my powers.

16:07.730 --> 16:09.130
So l'm done. l quit.

16:09.270 --> 16:10.790
- l'm out of here.
- You can't quit.

16:10.940 --> 16:13.400
l need to know
who's the most powerful young wizard.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.370
Scrittipolitti Noquitti

16:16.880 --> 16:17.930
Okay.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.050
l don't know what you just did to me,
but l still qui--

16:21.180 --> 16:23.440
l still qui--

16:23.580 --> 16:25.110
You can't quit now.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.240
- l put a no-quit spell on you.
- l qui--

16:28.390 --> 16:30.150
l qui--

16:30.290 --> 16:31.520
l wanna play. Oh, no.

16:31.660 --> 16:33.280
What am l saying? What am l doing?

16:33.760 --> 16:34.820
Give me my bidaddles.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.950
l don't want them. l'm gonna win.
No, you're not.

16:50.940 --> 16:53.430
Guys, l have great news.
Justin's gonna quit the tournament.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.480
Why would he quit?
That's not good news.

16:55.610 --> 16:56.710
l can explain, see--

16:56.850 --> 16:59.650
Wizards, student wizards,

16:59.790 --> 17:04.020
visiting parents,
goblins and ghouls, Larry,

17:04.160 --> 17:07.720
welcome to the Wiz Tech
12-Ball Finals.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.450
Our first competitor.

17:09.930 --> 17:13.460
Well, what can l say?
His name says it all.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.329
Jerko Phoenix.

17:28.850 --> 17:34.110
And a newcomer to the sport
and serious threat,

17:34.250 --> 17:36.620
even though he doesn't look like it.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.210
Justin Russo.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.620
Hi, Mom.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.630
Oh, look. He's waving at us.

17:49.770 --> 17:51.570
l don't wanna be here.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.100
l love you too.

17:54.810 --> 17:57.740
What is he doing here?
l told him not to play.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.610
You need to be more supportive
of your brother.

17:59.740 --> 18:03.180
l'm trying to save his powers
from getting sucked down a volcano.

18:03.880 --> 18:07.150
We really should get her
into a creative-writing class.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.750
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Evilini put a spell on me.

18:09.890 --> 18:11.820
l can't qui--

18:12.690 --> 18:14.680
First serve, Russo.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.830
He's gotta lose. Lose, Justin, lose.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.630
Alex.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.710
l didn't mean to do that.

18:33.850 --> 18:35.400
Way to go, son.

18:43.860 --> 18:45.190
Keep your eye on the balls.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.590
Miss it.

18:48.690 --> 18:50.790
Can someone please stop me?

18:54.630 --> 18:56.930
Oh, my gosh, they're up to 1 1 balls.

18:57.070 --> 18:58.930
No one's ever gotten to 12 before.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.840
The 12th ball. Get it, Justin.

19:23.060 --> 19:26.690
We have a winner.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.130
l can't believe it.
My brother's a champion.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.040
Congratulations, Justin Russo.

19:33.170 --> 19:37.230
You are the best 12-ball player
in the entire school.

19:37.380 --> 19:38.810
What are you going to do now?

19:38.940 --> 19:41.740
l'm going to Volcanoland.

19:43.380 --> 19:46.010
You certainly are.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.080
That's it. lt's over.

19:49.220 --> 19:52.050
l've tried everything.
l just can't beat Evilini.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.390
Justin's gonna lose his powers.

19:54.530 --> 19:56.790
Who are you talking to, honey?

19:57.260 --> 19:58.960
Not now.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.050
Here's an idea.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.860
l am talking to myself.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.700
Some are evil, some are kind
But now all must speak their mind

20:08.540 --> 20:10.800
So it's Justin.

20:11.810 --> 20:16.210
l'll take him to the volcano
and drain his powers for myself.

20:16.350 --> 20:17.610
Why am l saying this?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.310
Oh, no. A truth spell.

20:19.850 --> 20:22.550
They'll all hear my plan to become
the most powerful wizard.

20:22.690 --> 20:23.980
Stop talking.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.250
Security.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.460
l knew you could do it.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.930
You went to great lengths
to help your brother,

20:35.070 --> 20:37.230
and you brought Evilini down.

20:37.940 --> 20:41.100
When you apply yourself,
you can achieve a lot more than you think.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.010
- l guess l can.
- Hey.

20:43.580 --> 20:44.740
When you were at Volcanoland,

20:44.880 --> 20:48.070
did you happen to buy a T-shirt
in my size?

20:49.150 --> 20:50.910
Yeah, they're gonna mail it to you.

20:51.480 --> 20:52.710
Some are evil, some are ki--

20:52.850 --> 20:55.080
Okay, maybe l didn't.
But next time, okay?

20:55.220 --> 20:56.410
Okay.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.990
- Oh, Justin, honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

21:00.130 --> 21:01.520
Thanks to Alex.

21:01.660 --> 21:05.030
l can't believe my baby almost had
his powers drained in a volcano.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.460
We were very concerned.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.760
You still get to keep
the championship belt, though, right?

21:11.570 --> 21:15.370
Alex, l'm kind of glad you came
to summer school with me after all.

21:15.510 --> 21:17.840
Thanks for stopping Evilini
from stealing my powers.

21:17.980 --> 21:19.840
So from now on, you'll believe me?

21:19.980 --> 21:22.000
You know what? l will.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.910
l think we've grown up a lot
this summer.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.950
Yeah, me too.
Oh, you got something on your shirt.

21:27.690 --> 21:29.280
l'm not falling for it this time.

21:35.030 --> 21:37.890
Yeah. l saw that coming.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.540
lsn't this the strangest thing
you have ever seen?

22:00.690 --> 22:02.920
No, it's a dream come true.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.780
Giant things eating what they are.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.390
Come on, who hasn't had that dream?

22:10.300 --> 22:13.730
lf a giant claw comes out of the sky
and grabs one of them,

22:13.870 --> 22:16.130
then l've had that dream.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.370
That's weird.
