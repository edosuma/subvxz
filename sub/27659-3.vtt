WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:05.744
- Attention, squad.

00:05.788 --> 00:07.137
Put your hands together

00:07.181 --> 00:10.053
for the long-anticipated
reunion of...

00:10.097 --> 00:12.969
- The DDC!

00:13.013 --> 00:13.970
- DD...
- C!

00:14.014 --> 00:14.971
- DD...
- C!

00:15.015 --> 00:15.972
- Put a J with a G...

00:16.016 --> 00:17.017
- You get DD...

00:17.060 --> 00:18.975
both: C!

00:19.019 --> 00:20.150
- Uh, the gas face.

00:20.194 --> 00:21.325
- What the hell
is the DDC?

00:21.369 --> 00:22.674
- I don't know, but I love it!

00:22.718 --> 00:24.024
- The DDC is the Dope...

00:24.067 --> 00:25.155
- Denim...
- Crew.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.504
Our 20-year high school reunion

00:26.548 --> 00:28.463
is tonight, and the party
is '90s-themed,

00:28.506 --> 00:30.160
so we're dressing the way
we did back then,

00:30.204 --> 00:32.206
AKA hella fresh.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.295
- Can't wait to see everyone
we graduated with

00:34.338 --> 00:36.166
and lie to them
about what I've been up to

00:36.210 --> 00:37.689
for my own amusement.

00:37.733 --> 00:40.866
It's gonna be Fib City,
population: Gina Clooney.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.085
- But Jake, how can
you be excited

00:42.129 --> 00:43.695
to return to your high school,

00:43.739 --> 00:45.349
the scene of... Tattlegate?

00:45.393 --> 00:46.742
- What's Tattlegate?
Why haven't I heard

00:46.785 --> 00:48.831
anything about it?
- It was junior year

00:48.874 --> 00:50.398
and Jake was riding high--

00:50.441 --> 00:53.183
- Charles, no one wants
to hear this story...

00:53.227 --> 00:54.184
from you.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.185
It was junior year,

00:55.229 --> 00:57.187
and Jake was riding high.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.276
Sophomore year was rough,
but now I was back

00:59.320 --> 01:01.887
with a hot new look:
an earring and long hair.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.541
- Which was my look,
and he just copied it.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.543
- And it worked!
I was finally cool,

01:05.587 --> 01:07.154
and becoming friends
with the most popular kid

01:07.197 --> 01:09.286
in school: Brandon Bliss.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.158
- Dope name; sounds hot.
- He was hot, Rosa.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.029
- For the record,
he could barely read.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.552
- He didn't have to read, Gina.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.206
He lost his virginity
when he was 12 years old.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.816
- Which is horrifying.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.079
- But it wasn't back then!

01:19.122 --> 01:21.342
Back then, it was...
everything.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.213
He asked me to ditch class
one day with him

01:23.257 --> 01:24.562
and his buddies,
steal a school van,

01:24.606 --> 01:26.173
and go get drunk
at his parents' cabin,

01:26.216 --> 01:27.739
but the day before
we were supposed to go,

01:27.783 --> 01:30.351
someone ratted Brandon out,
and he got suspended!

01:30.394 --> 01:31.917
He thought I was the one
who told,

01:31.961 --> 01:33.267
and from that day forward,

01:33.310 --> 01:35.443
everyone called me
"The Tattler."

01:35.486 --> 01:37.140
- Tattler.
It's a sexy nickname.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.402
- It was not a sexy nickname!

01:38.446 --> 01:39.925
It was a scarlet letter,

01:39.969 --> 01:42.058
and it ruined my senior year,

01:42.102 --> 01:44.756
but luckily,
I'm over all that now.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.757
- Not me.
I'm gonna go

01:45.801 --> 01:47.063
to this reunion tonight

01:47.107 --> 01:48.586
and kick Brandon Bliss
in the butthole.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.501
- Horrifying, but that won't
be necessary, Charles,

01:50.545 --> 01:52.286
for my awesome life will do
the butthole-kicking this eve.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.418
I've got a sweet job,
and a super-smart,

01:54.462 --> 01:56.159
incredible wife.
Tonight's gonna be awesome.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.334
Right, Gina?
- Damn straight!

01:57.378 --> 01:58.814
- DD...
- C!

01:58.857 --> 01:59.902
- DD...
- C!

01:59.945 --> 02:00.903
- DD...
- C!

02:22.185 --> 02:23.839
- Wow, this place
hasn't changed

02:23.882 --> 02:25.536
one bit
in 20 years.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.799
It's a real indictment
of the public school system.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.279
- Jake!
Tina!

02:29.323 --> 02:31.412
- No way!
Mikey J!

02:31.455 --> 02:32.935
Amy, this is Mike Joseph,

02:32.978 --> 02:36.547
AKA the lead funk bassist
from my legendary ska band,

02:36.591 --> 02:39.768
Skalvester Skallone.
We had one song.

02:39.811 --> 02:40.986
♪ Oh

02:41.030 --> 02:44.033
all: ♪ Stop or my mom
will ska ♪

02:44.076 --> 02:45.904
♪ Stop or my mom will ska

02:45.948 --> 02:47.602
- Whoa!
- Hey, man.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.081
We were so bad.
I can't believe

02:49.125 --> 02:50.300
we thought
we were gonna make it.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.041
So what have you been up to,
man?

02:52.084 --> 02:54.304
- Well, I'm still trying to
get the music thing started.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.871
- Oh, cool, cool, cool.
Never give up.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.308
- Anyway, how are you, Gina?
What have you been up to?

02:58.352 --> 03:00.180
- Nothing crazy.
Yeah, just writing

03:00.223 --> 03:02.094
those "Thor" movies.
- Seriously?

03:02.138 --> 03:03.835
Oh, my God.
Tell me everything.

03:03.879 --> 03:06.186
- Legally, I can't get into it
too much,

03:06.229 --> 03:07.448
but just know that the next one

03:07.491 --> 03:08.971
will have a lot more
full frontal.

03:09.014 --> 03:11.843
- Well, if you need some ska
for your soundtrack...

03:11.887 --> 03:13.105
- Oh!

03:13.149 --> 03:14.194
This is them.
This is Marvel.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.673
They probably want to talk

03:15.717 --> 03:18.415
about "Thor 4: More Thor."
I gotta take this.

03:18.459 --> 03:19.503
Okay?
- All right.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.157
So how you doing, Jake?

03:21.201 --> 03:23.986
I know the end of high school
was a little... rough.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.596
- Oh, uh...

03:25.640 --> 03:28.033
- Jake's killing it now.
He's a detective.

03:28.077 --> 03:30.819
- Irie, mon!
Irie, irie!

03:30.862 --> 03:31.994
Very nice.

03:32.037 --> 03:34.126
God, you must have
some crazy stories.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.302
- Oh, I don't know.
I mean,

03:35.345 --> 03:36.433
is successfully negotiating

03:36.477 --> 03:37.913
a high-tension
hostage situation

03:37.956 --> 03:39.523
in a bank crazy?

03:39.567 --> 03:40.568
- Yes!

03:40.611 --> 03:41.960
- Oh, well, then, I guess
I do have

03:42.004 --> 03:43.701
some crazy stories, mon!

03:45.094 --> 03:46.313
- Gosh, it's so cool

03:46.356 --> 03:47.836
how we all still dress
the same.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.535
- Is it so much to ask?
You know what I'm saying?

03:51.579 --> 03:53.233
- Why is everyone
gathered around the radio?

03:53.276 --> 03:54.495
Ooh, are they testing

03:54.538 --> 03:55.496
the emergency
broadcasting system?

03:55.539 --> 03:57.019
- What?
No.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.412
We're listening to a contest.

03:58.455 --> 04:00.240
- This is 93.7,

04:00.283 --> 04:01.632
The Jamhouse, with...

04:01.676 --> 04:03.547
all: JC and the Horndog!

04:04.592 --> 04:05.941
-  FM radio...

04:05.984 --> 04:08.073
- Yeah, the hosts
are beyond disgusting,

04:08.117 --> 04:10.772
but they do a fun game
where they play a mystery sound

04:10.815 --> 04:12.643
and callers guess what it is
for a cash prize.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.515
- Shh, they're about to play
the new sound!

04:17.300 --> 04:18.606
- It's a crinkle.
I solved it.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.911
- Yes, but you have to know
what object

04:19.955 --> 04:21.304
is making the crinkle.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.436
- But that's impossible.
It could be anything.

04:22.479 --> 04:23.741
- Yes, sir.
That's the game.

04:23.785 --> 04:24.960
- It's a bag of potato chips.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.048
- Don't be an idiot!

04:26.091 --> 04:27.397
It's a bag of corn chips.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.746
- Well, this is
a total waste of time.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.574
- Sure, but you can still
have fun,

04:30.618 --> 04:32.359
even if you're wasting time.
- That's absurd.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.317
Productivity is what
makes things fun.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.928
That's why humans go to work.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.190
- It is?

04:38.234 --> 04:39.670
- Hey.
So you know

04:39.714 --> 04:41.150
how Alicia and I broke up
because she moved to London,

04:41.193 --> 04:42.586
then we tried to make it work,

04:42.630 --> 04:43.935
but the distance was too much
and we broke up again?

04:43.979 --> 04:45.459
- No.
The last thing you told me

04:45.502 --> 04:46.721
about yourself was that
you were bi.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.113
- Well, a lot has happened
since then.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.245
Anyway, I'm dating
two other people.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.377
- So much juice at one time.

04:50.420 --> 04:51.508
I'm drowning.

04:51.552 --> 04:52.509
- Oh, gross.
Charles, this is why

04:52.553 --> 04:53.597
I don't tell you anything.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.120
- I take it back.
- Okay.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.426
Well, it's early stages,
but they both tagged me

04:56.470 --> 04:57.645
in a bunch of photos online,

04:57.688 --> 04:59.037
and they found out
about each other.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.474
- Yikes.
- Yeah, I know.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.127
I shouldn't 'gram so much,
but my brunch friends say

05:02.171 --> 05:03.520
it's the only way to promote
my handmade jewelry line.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.782
- Brunch? What?

05:04.826 --> 05:06.436
Homemade--who--
- Charles, focus.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.698
Anyway, they're both annoyed,

05:07.742 --> 05:09.178
and now I have to
choose one of them,

05:09.221 --> 05:10.614
and I cannot make up my mind.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.094
It's insane.
I never have trouble

05:12.137 --> 05:13.617
making decisions.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.358
- Ugh.
Choose the daughter.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.925
I always know exactly
what to do,

05:16.968 --> 05:18.883
but for the first time
in my life, I am stumped.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.885
- Rosa, you've come
to the right man.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.757
Boyles are genetically
indecisive beings.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.585
- So I chose the worst
possible person to help me?

05:24.628 --> 05:26.064
- No.
We've developed

05:26.108 --> 05:27.805
a foolproof system to help us
make choices.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.633
It used to take me so long
to decide what to wear

05:29.677 --> 05:31.374
that I'd never change
my clothes.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.984
Now look what I have on.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.160
- Is this different than what
you were wearing yesterday?

05:35.204 --> 05:36.379
- Barely.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.468
- Wow, your life
sounds amazing.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.078
I'm really happy
it worked out for you,

05:40.122 --> 05:42.342
you know, especially with
the whole Tattler thing.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.779
-  What?
The Tattler? Wow.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.389
I haven't heard that
in a long time.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.738
Who even was the Tattler?

05:47.782 --> 05:49.174
- You.
That's why I'm bringing it up.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.480
- Oh, right, I remember now

05:50.524 --> 05:51.786
that I was misidentified
as the Tattler.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.353
That's so funny.
But I wasn't the Tattler,

05:53.396 --> 05:54.658
so I'm pretty sure
you got this wrong.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.399
- No, no, no, I think
I go--hey, Eric.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.793
Didn't people call Jake
the Tattler?

05:58.836 --> 05:59.837
- Oh, yeah!

06:01.186 --> 06:03.014
Oh, good, more people
are getting involved.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.539
- After my initial design,
they said it couldn't be done.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.367
They said it was too tall,
too flashy--

06:07.410 --> 06:09.064
building codes, bureaucracy.

06:09.107 --> 06:12.197
Cut to the Freedom Tower
as you see it today.

06:12.241 --> 06:13.373
- Wow.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.418
- Thank you.
Yeah, I agree.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.724
- Look, nobody cares
about that stuff.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.203
We're all adults now.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.249
You're a cop.
I work at a coffin factory.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.512
I'm not sitting around,
thinking about how you tattled.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.035
- Yes, we all have jobs
and work on coffins.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.428
I didn't tattle, but whatevs.
We don't have to keep

06:25.472 --> 06:26.429
talking about it.

06:26.473 --> 06:29.040
all, successively: Great.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.520
- But you were the Tattler,
right?

06:30.564 --> 06:31.826
- Brandon Bliss was my friend!

06:31.869 --> 06:33.436
Why would I tattle
on my friend?

06:33.480 --> 06:35.438
The nickname was inaccurate,
is all I'm saying.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.700
Anyways, as you can tell,

06:36.744 --> 06:38.354
I am totally over it.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.225
- Ah, man, it's the Tattler.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.226
- I didn't tattle!

06:42.402 --> 06:43.577
So...

06:43.620 --> 06:45.579
I think I might not
be over it.

06:48.364 --> 06:49.974
- Ugh, this is so unfair.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.280
Everyone remembers me
as the Tattler,

06:51.323 --> 06:52.803
but somehow, no one remembers

06:52.847 --> 06:54.283
that Darren "Doo Doo" Donaldson

06:54.326 --> 06:55.763
crapped himself during PE.

06:55.806 --> 06:56.894
Look at him out there,

06:56.938 --> 06:58.243
dancing on the dance floor

06:58.287 --> 06:59.984
like he's lived
a doo doo-free life.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.508
- Jake, this isn't so bad.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.553
History is full
of great tattlers.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.816
Martin Luther King
tattled on racists.

07:05.860 --> 07:06.991
- That's a pretty
undercutting way

07:07.035 --> 07:08.297
of describing
his accomplishments.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.994
- I was trying to help.
It felt bad.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.387
- It's not even the nickname
that bothers me.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.693
It's that I'm being
wrongfully accused.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.477
I didn't tattle.
I mean, if it was the truth,

07:14.521 --> 07:16.392
go ahead and call me
the Tattler all day long.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.134
- Hey, Tattler.
- Not cool, Jason!

07:19.177 --> 07:20.614
Let's just go home.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.180
- No!
We're not going anywhere.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.356
You were wrongfully accused.
We're cops.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.184
Let's just find
the real Tattler

07:26.228 --> 07:27.490
and prove your innocence.

07:27.534 --> 07:28.491
- Yes!
I love it!

07:28.535 --> 07:29.361
Why learn to grow

07:29.405 --> 07:31.015
when you can fix the past?

07:31.059 --> 07:32.800
This is exactly why
I don't need therapy.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.105
- Not sure that's the lesson

07:34.149 --> 07:35.193
I want you to take away
from this.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.499
- Too late!
We're gonna prove

07:36.543 --> 07:37.631
I wasn't the Tattler.
Therapy is a scam.

07:37.674 --> 07:38.632
Let's do this.

07:39.676 --> 07:40.677
- No.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.505
The sound was more of a "khh."

07:42.549 --> 07:44.028
- Ooh, how goes
the crinkle hunt?

07:44.072 --> 07:45.900
I see you're not just
wasting time.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.902
You're also wasting tin.

07:47.945 --> 07:50.165
- It was only one piece.

07:50.208 --> 07:53.037
Okay, it was a ton of tin.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.386
- Pretty sure it's a guy
eating a sandwich.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.779
I'll prove it to you.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.564
- I'm not buying you
any more sandwiches, Scully.

07:57.607 --> 07:58.390
- I'm doing this for us!

07:58.434 --> 08:00.088
- Guys, we can't fight.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.655
That's what the Horndog wants.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.004
- We're getting close.
We just need

08:03.047 --> 08:04.222
to keep testing more things.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.181
- Oh, that's a good idea.

08:06.224 --> 08:09.619
Have you tried
a piece of paper?

08:09.663 --> 08:10.620
Is that your crinkle?

08:10.664 --> 08:12.361
Ooh, maybe--oh.

08:12.404 --> 08:15.190
Maybe it's these bags
of coffee beans.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.192
- All right, sir.
I think you've made your point.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.933
- My point?
Oh, I'm just trying to have fun

08:18.976 --> 08:20.412
by wasting time.

08:20.456 --> 08:23.198
Oh, maybe it's this
crinkly-crunkly yogurt.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.115
- Terry heard a crinkle.

08:27.158 --> 08:28.595
- Holt heard a crinkle, too.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.422
- So suddenly, it's not a waste
of time?

08:30.466 --> 08:32.990
- Not a waste of time
if we win!

08:33.034 --> 08:34.644
What are you waiting for,
Jeffords?

08:34.688 --> 08:36.385
Call the Horndog!

08:36.428 --> 08:37.995
- So then I said
to Steve,

08:38.039 --> 08:40.084
"What if we drop the
'-lications,'

08:40.128 --> 08:41.695
just call them 'apps'?"

08:41.738 --> 08:43.566
- That's incredible.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.525
Do you miss him?
- Oh, every day, Laura.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.917
Every day.
- You should talk

08:46.961 --> 08:48.440
to Quentin Chase.
He's a big-time

08:48.484 --> 08:49.703
Silicon Valley investor now,

08:49.746 --> 08:50.965
and he was just telling me
all about it.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.096
Quentin, come here.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.533
You have got to talk to Gina.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.317
She basically invented apps.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.058
They were going
to be called "lications."

08:57.101 --> 08:58.276
- You really bungled that.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.495
- What you been working on?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.236
- Currently,
I have been working

09:01.279 --> 09:03.586
on an app called Toddler.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.893
It's like Tinder,
but for toddlers.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.242
Tinder for toddlers.

09:07.285 --> 09:08.896
- I like it.
How are you gonna spell that?

09:08.939 --> 09:10.071
How many D's?

09:10.114 --> 09:12.073
- Five.

09:12.116 --> 09:14.466
- All right, we should start
by talking to Brandon Bliss

09:14.510 --> 09:16.425
and find out who told him
you were the Tattler.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.905
- Unfortunately, Bliss
is not here.

09:17.948 --> 09:20.516
Probably in the VIP section
at a Fatboy Slim concert.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.431
- Would that be cool
for a 37-year-old?

09:22.474 --> 09:24.085
- The funk soul brother
is timeless, Ames.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.261
All right, I don't know
who told Brandon,

09:26.304 --> 09:27.784
but I heard it was someone
on the football team.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.699
- Okay, well, we need
more information than that,

09:29.743 --> 09:31.658
so take me back to the day.
Spare no details.

09:31.701 --> 09:32.963
- Okay, I saw Brandon

09:33.007 --> 09:34.617
after second period,
and everything seemed tight.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.445
- ♪ Hey now,
you're an all-star ♪

09:36.488 --> 09:38.621
♪ Get your game on
go play ♪

09:38.665 --> 09:40.405
- But then, when I saw him
after third period...

09:40.449 --> 09:42.407
something had clearly changed.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.974
- ♪ Get paid

09:44.018 --> 09:45.976
♪ All that glitters
is gold ♪

09:46.020 --> 09:47.587
- After that, there was

09:47.630 --> 09:49.240
little color left in the world
for young Jake.

09:49.284 --> 09:52.896
My earring, less gold,
my JNCO jeans less purple.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.768
- Are you sure
you were becoming cool?

09:54.811 --> 09:55.812
- Yeah.
Why?

09:55.856 --> 09:57.292
- I know how to solve this.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.554
We just have to find out
which football player

09:58.598 --> 10:00.034
had third period
with Brandon Bliss.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.339
We need his class schedule.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.645
- Yeah, but where
are we gonna find that?

10:02.689 --> 10:04.473
- In the coolest room
in the school.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.477
- Good lord!

10:08.520 --> 10:09.913
You coulda just picked
the lock.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.132
- I know.
I'm sorry.

10:11.175 --> 10:13.003
I'm just so amped up
about Admin.

10:13.047 --> 10:16.137
- Okay, this is the Boyle
decision-making manual.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.617
One of these sections
will help you

10:17.660 --> 10:19.096
with choosing your partner.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.315
Here we go.
What do you prefer,

10:20.358 --> 10:21.925
eyes or butt,
brains or body?

10:21.969 --> 10:23.318
- Brains.
- Uh...

10:23.361 --> 10:24.493
Sorry, no, that's
for deciding lunch.

10:24.536 --> 10:25.712
- Horrifying.
- Oh, I found

10:25.755 --> 10:26.800
the romance section.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.584
Now, first, I will need
the names

10:28.628 --> 10:30.499
of the two people
you're choosing between.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.283
- I will not be telling you
any information about them.

10:32.327 --> 10:33.676
- No problem.
We can work with that.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.504
I will just call them
by their initials.

10:35.547 --> 10:36.766
- No.
- I will call them

10:36.810 --> 10:38.507
"Couscous" and "Quinoa."
- Whatever.

10:38.550 --> 10:39.943
- Okay, now, for this
to work right, you need

10:39.987 --> 10:41.336
to answer these questions
without thinking.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.685
Who makes you laugh more?
- Quinoa.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.078
- Who has softer lips?
- Couscous.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.514
- A new Cirque du Soleil's
in town.

10:45.557 --> 10:46.907
You have the two best seats
in the house.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.299
Who are you bringing?
- Is this a reward

10:48.343 --> 10:49.518
or a punishment?
- You decide.

10:49.561 --> 10:50.606
- Quinoa.
- Great. Next question:

10:50.650 --> 10:51.651
You die and become a ghost.

10:51.694 --> 10:52.956
The rules of the afterlife

10:53.000 --> 10:54.349
are that of the movie "Casper."

10:54.392 --> 10:55.698
Whose house
would you rather haunt?

10:55.742 --> 10:57.047
- How many more
of these questions are there?

10:57.091 --> 10:58.353
- 309.

10:58.396 --> 10:59.746
- Okay, I've got something.
- Oh.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.661
That's not Brandon's profile.
It's mine.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.010
- I just want a quick peek
at your attendance record.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.141
Zero absences.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.361
Oh, mama...

11:06.404 --> 11:07.536
Printing this for later.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.146
- Keep it in your pants,
Santiago.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.974
- Oh, that's exactly
where it's going.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.543
Okay, here's Brandon's info.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.023
Third period, first semester...

11:16.066 --> 11:17.720
Any of these people
on the football team?

11:17.764 --> 11:20.288
Scott Alford, Taylor Black--
wow, Tom Brady?

11:20.331 --> 11:22.116
- Different Tom Brady.
He was in theater.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.465
Although he was the MVP

11:23.508 --> 11:24.596
of that year's production
of "Fiddler."

11:24.640 --> 11:25.859
- Hm.
- Wait a minute.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.251
Danny Matthews.
That's the guy.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.557
He was on the football team.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.819
That's the bastard
who set me up.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.821
- Yeah, and look at this.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.041
You did so much
community service.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.738
Me like-y.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.656
- Guys, you know how I thought
it would be so much fun

11:40.700 --> 11:41.875
to lie to everyone tonight?

11:41.918 --> 11:43.528
- Yeah. Did it finally
catch up with you?

11:43.572 --> 11:44.747
- No, the opposite.
Someone wants to buy

11:44.791 --> 11:46.096
a company I made up
on the spot.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.532
The elevator pitch
had him drooling.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.317
As a mother,
I'm always struggling

11:49.360 --> 11:50.797
to find quality playdates.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.669
Most two-year-olds
are boring, lame duds.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.497
- All of my daughter's friends
suck.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.065
- Well, with Todddddler's
proprietary algorithm,

11:58.108 --> 12:00.720
you will be matched
with top tots,

12:00.763 --> 12:01.895
and those boring duds--

12:01.938 --> 12:03.331
they'll stay where they belong:

12:03.374 --> 12:06.987
the hell away
from you and your family.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.163
I'm not really sure
how to close this.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.165
Maybe you guys could pretend
to be heirs

12:11.208 --> 12:14.734
to a canned-goods fortune
who want to buy my company!

12:14.777 --> 12:16.387
- Gina, we don't have time
for your thing right now.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.215
- Oh, smart.
Big-time him.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.608
That's the perfect idea.

12:19.651 --> 12:20.957
I won't forget you
when I'm rich.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.654
Thanks so much,
Jake and Jake's wife.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.047
- She knows your name.
Oh, look!

12:24.091 --> 12:25.614
It's Danny Matthews!
But he'll never talk

12:25.657 --> 12:26.963
with all these people around.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.573
- Not a problem.
Just be in the science lab

12:28.617 --> 12:30.227
in ten minutes.
I'll get him alone.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.359
- What are you gonna do?

12:31.402 --> 12:32.447
- Let's just say I'm not above

12:32.490 --> 12:33.927
using my feminine wiles.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.537
Danny Matthews,
I'm with the school.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.843
You need to follow me
right now.

12:36.886 --> 12:40.498
- Is everything--
- I said now, mister.

12:40.542 --> 12:41.804
- I'm one caller away.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.110
I can't believe
we figured it out.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.155
- And I can't believe
it took you this long.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.244
Yogurt is literally
your one thing.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.116
- Okay, okay.
- Well, I'm just saying.

12:49.159 --> 12:51.031
If the sound were
eating damp rice,

12:51.074 --> 12:52.772
I would've gotten it
immediately.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.164
- Guys, they're taking
another guess.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.862
- All right,
Brenda from Yonkers.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.777
It's time for you
to name that sound.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.213
- Hi.
Quick shout-out

12:59.256 --> 13:01.041
to the nurses
at United Pediatric.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.651
This money'll do those kids
a lot of good.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.174
- Cry me a river.
Brenda from Yonkers.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.481
We've all had budget cuts.
Just take your guess.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.787
- Is it Styrofoam?

13:07.830 --> 13:09.353
- Wrong!

13:09.397 --> 13:11.616
- Oh, I can't believe
she guessed Styrofoam.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.401
What a dumb nurse.

13:13.444 --> 13:15.272
- Next caller, you're on
with the Horndog.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.273
- It's me!

13:16.317 --> 13:18.536
The sound is a yogurt

13:18.580 --> 13:19.842
being opened.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.889
- That is...

13:22.932 --> 13:24.194
Wrong!

13:24.238 --> 13:25.413
- What?
No!

13:25.456 --> 13:27.415
- You b-b-b-blew it!

13:27.458 --> 13:29.634
- Damn you, Horndog.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.245
- Okay, I have tabulated
your responses,

13:31.288 --> 13:33.073
and the results
are definitive.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.205
- Amazing.
- It's a dead tie.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.685
- This is dumb.
I'm just gonna end it

13:36.728 --> 13:37.817
with both of them.
- Rosa, stop.

13:37.860 --> 13:38.948
There is one more method.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.907
Ancient Boyles believed

13:40.950 --> 13:43.648
that suspending yourself
by your feet forces your blood

13:43.692 --> 13:45.389
to the decision center
of your brain.

13:45.433 --> 13:49.437
We call this method
the "Upside-Down Coward."

13:49.480 --> 13:51.091
- You want me to hang
from the ceiling like a bat?

13:51.134 --> 13:52.962
- The bat is nature's
most decisive animal.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.616
- The creature
that flails around frantically?

13:54.659 --> 13:55.835
- Those are all
micro-decisions.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.314
Now, let's get you strapped up.

13:58.359 --> 13:59.490
How do you feel?

13:59.534 --> 14:00.622
- Nauseous.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.667
- Good.
It's working.

14:02.711 --> 14:03.886
- Q?
- Yeah.

14:03.930 --> 14:04.887
- Get off the phone.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.019
Now, I'm not sure

14:06.062 --> 14:07.455
how serious you were
about funding,

14:07.498 --> 14:11.067
but I should tell you
there's 103 other bidders.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.156
- Oof, I am not a fan
of getting into bidding wars.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.811
- Then don't make an offer,
'cause I want babies on my app,

14:15.855 --> 14:17.639
but not in my boardroom.

14:17.682 --> 14:18.858
Oh, damn, Gina.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.511
- Did you just
"oh, damn" yourself?

14:20.555 --> 14:21.599
- Someone had to.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.688
- Okay.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.212
Let's talk numbers.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.083
- Mr. Peralta, I believe
you know Danny Matthews.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.868
- Jake.
Hey, what's going on, man?

14:28.911 --> 14:30.086
- The answer to that question

14:30.130 --> 14:33.046
goes back to a brisk day
in 1997,

14:33.089 --> 14:35.483
a day you told a lie.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.616
But the lying stops right now!

14:38.660 --> 14:40.183
Oh, no!

14:40.227 --> 14:41.881
You broke some poor kid's
science project!

14:41.924 --> 14:43.186
We have to fix it.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.535
- Kind of in the middle
of something.

14:44.579 --> 14:45.754
- Oh, you know what?
Krebs cycle.

14:45.797 --> 14:46.755
I got this.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.583
- Great.
So, Danny,

14:48.626 --> 14:49.714
true or false?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.020
You were on the football team.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.761
- True?
- And true or false:

14:52.804 --> 14:54.850
you had third period
with Brandon Bliss.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.199
- Mm, I honestly
don't remember--

14:56.243 --> 14:57.592
- It was true!
We checked the records,

14:57.635 --> 14:59.072
and I have one more question.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.900
- Ooh, Jake, can you get me
that oxygen on the floor?

15:00.943 --> 15:02.336
Little red guy.
- What?

15:02.379 --> 15:03.337
- Sorry.
You know what?

15:03.380 --> 15:04.773
Yeah, I'll get it.

15:04.816 --> 15:05.992
- Why did you tell
Brandon Bliss

15:06.035 --> 15:07.471
that I was the Tattler?

15:07.515 --> 15:09.082
- Because you were.
I saw you talking to principal.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.344
I remember it, clear as day.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.911
- Look, you couldn't
have seen me,

15:11.954 --> 15:13.477
because I wasn't there.
I didn't tattle.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.218
- Man, it was you, okay?

15:15.262 --> 15:17.264
You had your long hair
and your little earring,

15:17.307 --> 15:20.832
and the denim jacket you are
literally wearing right now.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.573
- Oh, no.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.662
It wasn't me,

15:24.706 --> 15:26.751
but it was the DDC.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.188
Gina.

15:28.231 --> 15:30.799
- Jake, guess who just sold
her app idea.

15:30.842 --> 15:31.974
- Don't trust her.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.454
Everything she's told you
is a lie.

15:33.497 --> 15:34.977
She made up the company
and everything else.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.196
She's a liar.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.806
- Jake, whatever strategy
this is

15:37.849 --> 15:39.634
is not necessary.
I already closed the deal.

15:39.677 --> 15:42.419
- I know you were the Tattler.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.903
- Amy, I'm ready to go.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.991
- Yep, totally.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.340
I'm almost done
with this project,

15:50.384 --> 15:51.820
but I don't need
to finish it,

15:51.863 --> 15:52.995
because what matters

15:53.039 --> 15:54.997
is that you are going
through something,

15:55.041 --> 15:57.782
and as your wife,
and love of your life--

15:57.826 --> 15:59.480
- Are you vamping
so you can finish that?

15:59.523 --> 16:00.872
- I only have
two molecules left.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.092
Come on, man.
- Jake, we need to talk.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.789
- Yeah, you guys
do need to talk.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.575
That sounds excellent.
Friendship, so much history...

16:07.618 --> 16:09.316
I'm just gonna get this
out of your way.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.274
- Oh, man.

16:11.318 --> 16:12.623
What the hell, Gina?

16:12.667 --> 16:14.625
You ruined
my entire senior year.

16:14.669 --> 16:15.975
How could you do that to me?

16:16.018 --> 16:17.411
- Jake, I was only
trying to help.

16:17.454 --> 16:18.978
You were hanging out
with those guys

16:19.021 --> 16:20.849
and getting close,
and they weren't good people.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.807
Do you know why Brandon
wasn't at the reunion tonight?

16:22.851 --> 16:24.244
- I don't know.
Probably 'cause he was shooting

16:24.287 --> 16:25.549
a beer commercial
where the whole plot

16:25.593 --> 16:26.986
was that everyone wanted
to sleep with him.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.552
- No, 'cause he's on parole.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.641
He's not allowed to leave
the state of Delaware.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.469
- Oh, okay, so that's
obviously a bummer,

16:32.513 --> 16:33.993
but I wasn't gonna end up
like him.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.124
- You were starting to.
You wanted

16:35.168 --> 16:36.430
to steal a van with him,

16:36.473 --> 16:37.692
and I told you not to,

16:37.735 --> 16:39.215
and you weren't listening
to me.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.825
I mean, what would've happened
if you got caught?

16:40.869 --> 16:42.001
- I don't know.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.567
- You would never
have become a cop.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.569
Yeah, I'm the reason
you're a cop.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.180
I'm your origin story, dude.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.790
You can't be mad at me.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.357
- I feel like
I'm still pretty mad.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.185
- Peter Parker wasn't mad
at his spider.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.143
- Yeah, but they weren't
best friends before the bite,

16:54.187 --> 16:56.058
and it still doesn't explain
how you let everyone think

16:56.102 --> 16:57.929
I was the Tattler for 20 years.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.931
- Well, I didn't want
to lose our friendship.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.237
I was being weak.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.500
I'm sorry.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.328
-  Okay.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.808
- And if it makes you
feel any better,

17:06.851 --> 17:09.071
that app thing
completely blew up in my face.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.030
I mean, my night sucked.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.814
Okay, I can see
from your expression

17:12.857 --> 17:14.468
that your night was worse,

17:14.511 --> 17:17.123
and I should've left it
at "sorry."

17:17.166 --> 17:18.515
- So did you hear?

17:18.559 --> 17:19.603
Someone guessed the sound.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.040
It was a bag of chips.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.345
- Wow.
So the lesson here

17:22.389 --> 17:23.999
is to listen to Hitchcock
and Scully more?

17:24.043 --> 17:25.348
- No, that can't be possible.
- Yeah, I don't think

17:25.392 --> 17:26.915
we earned that today.
- Agreed.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.699
- Sorry for dragging you
into that dumb game.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.919
You were right.
It was a waste of time.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.355
- No, it wasn't.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.009
Even though it was pointless,
I did enjoy myself.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.142
I can't wait
to go home and tell Kevin

17:36.185 --> 17:39.058
you can have fun
without being productive.

17:39.101 --> 17:42.104
- Hey, guys, they're about
to play the new mystery sound.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.410
- I can tell Kevin tomorrow.

17:43.453 --> 17:44.715
- I'll bet Sharon's
already asleep.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.413
- And I've got no one
in my life.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.937
- Scully, play that damn noise.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.070
- Quentin, can I talk to you
for a minute?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.810
- Are you here to give me
a long speech

17:52.854 --> 17:54.377
about how you still deserve
my money?

17:54.421 --> 17:55.422
- No.

17:55.465 --> 17:56.640
I am.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.077
- Very cool entrance.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.426
- Thank you.
Listen.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.341
Gina Linetti is not
a perfect person.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.516
- Mm, I'm hoping this gets
more supportive

18:02.559 --> 18:03.821
as it goes along.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.214
- But what she lacks
in perfection,

18:05.258 --> 18:06.781
she makes up for

18:06.824 --> 18:08.478
with an utter and total belief
that she is perfect.

18:08.522 --> 18:09.827
- Ooh, you said "but,"
and then you said

18:09.871 --> 18:11.655
something worse.
- She is fiercely loyal.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.223
She will do
the right thing for you

18:14.267 --> 18:16.573
even when you can't see it
for yourself,

18:16.617 --> 18:19.489
and she's saved my ass
countless times.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.751
- And it's been 12.
I counted.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.231
- She came up with an idea
on the spot

18:22.275 --> 18:23.711
that you were interested in.

18:23.754 --> 18:26.105
Imagine what she could do
with time and resources.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.019
Do the world a favor.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.326
Invest in Gina Linetti.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.418
- Hard pass.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.290
both: What?
- But my great speech.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.595
- Yeah, the speech was great,

18:38.639 --> 18:41.294
but I've also been lying
the whole night.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.730
I'm not a tech mogul.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.079
I came here
to mess with people.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.950
- How dare you?
- Speaking of which,

18:45.994 --> 18:47.909
did either one of you drive?
'Cause I could use a ride.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.172
- No, Quentin.
- Oh, Quentin.

18:51.478 --> 18:52.696
- Okay.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.002
Now open your eyes,

18:54.045 --> 18:56.265
and the person you are meant
to be with

18:56.309 --> 18:59.442
should appear before you.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.489
- Sorry.
I was just watching.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.839
- Get out of here, Hitchcock!

19:04.882 --> 19:05.622
Ugh.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.841
- This isn't working.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.277
I'm no closer
to making a decision.

19:08.321 --> 19:09.583
I'm jumping down.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.150
- Well, you can't
just jump down.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.587
My goodness!
- It's over.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.762
I'm gonna put 'em both
in a group text

19:14.805 --> 19:15.893
and say "peace out."
- Uh, no!

19:15.937 --> 19:17.199
There's still more options.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.592
We haven't even
done roleplay yet.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.159
- What?

19:20.202 --> 19:21.334
Ugh.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.465
I took too long
getting back to Quinoa

19:22.509 --> 19:23.727
and they got mad
and ended it.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.294
- And that's how it's done.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.166
- What are you talking about?
- The process worked.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.645
Boyles don't make decisions.

19:28.689 --> 19:29.994
We delay our decisions

19:30.038 --> 19:31.692
until the universe
makes them for us.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.868
That way, we never make
a wrong choice.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.044
- That is very sad,
but also, I guess it worked.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.437
- Mm-hmm.
- I do feel pretty good.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.003
Couscous is dope.
She's funny.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.614
- Couscous is a she!
I knew it!

19:40.657 --> 19:42.616
- Did you?
- No, and I still don't know.

19:42.659 --> 19:43.660
There's equal chance
you called them "she"

19:43.704 --> 19:44.661
to throw me off.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.838
- You get me, Boyle.

19:47.882 --> 19:51.059
- So I think I figured out
an awesome and dramatic way

19:51.102 --> 19:53.409
to reveal that I
was the Tattler.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.194
It'll be a dance.
There'll be costumes.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.674
- Gina, it's fine.
I don't care anymore.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.676
It's all in the past.
- Oh, thank God.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.200
That is such a relief,

20:01.243 --> 20:03.463
'cause I didn't want people
thinking I was a tattler.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.378
Where's Amy?

20:05.421 --> 20:06.640
- She is in the library,
writing

20:06.683 --> 20:07.989
a book report
on "Jane Eyre,"

20:08.032 --> 20:10.513
and she told me
"not to wait up."

20:10.557 --> 20:11.688
- Oy.
- Yeah.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.735
- Thanks for trying to help
with Quentin.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.258
It's funny.
Even though it wasn't real,

20:16.302 --> 20:19.305
it was so fun, imagining
running my own company.

20:19.348 --> 20:20.567
- So why don't your pursue it?

20:20.610 --> 20:22.699
- I can't raise my kid
and create an app

20:22.743 --> 20:24.310
and work at the Nine-Nine.
It's too much.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.529
- Well, then prepare for me
to murder your parents

20:26.573 --> 20:27.617
right in front of your face.

20:27.661 --> 20:28.836
- Rude.
- No.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.403
It's Batman's origin story,

20:30.446 --> 20:32.318
like the radioactive
spider thing you did with me.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.884
- I don't read comic books.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.626
- You helped me
become who I am,

20:36.670 --> 20:38.324
so now I'm gonna
return the favor.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.023
Gina...

20:42.066 --> 20:43.981
I think your talents might
be wasted at the Nine-Nine.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.723
I love you, but it might
be time for you to move on.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.377
- Um, are you firing me?

20:48.421 --> 20:49.378
- What? No.
I don't think

20:49.422 --> 20:50.379
I could even do that.

20:50.423 --> 20:51.685
- Good, because I quit.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.164
You know, tonight I realized

20:53.208 --> 20:54.557
that my talents

20:54.601 --> 20:56.080
are being wasted
at the Nine-Nine.

20:56.124 --> 20:57.995
- Okay, that's kind of exactly
what I just said.

20:58.039 --> 21:01.260
- Jake, let me finish.
This is serious.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.305
It's time for me to move on.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.307
For real, though, it is.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.308
- Really?

21:10.356 --> 21:12.314
Okay.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.968
- Proud of you.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.143
- Thank you.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.405
I'm proud of me, too.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.234
- Guys!

21:19.278 --> 21:20.540
Vice principal caught me
in the library.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.411
Let's roll!

21:22.455 --> 21:24.413
- Not a doctor.
Shh.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.415
- Fremulon.
