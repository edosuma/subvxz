WEBVTT

00:13.461 --> 00:15.394
He'’s forgotten his trunks.

00:15.429 --> 00:16.844
What time is swimming?

00:16.878 --> 00:18.408
Actually I don't even know
why I'm asking you that,

00:18.432 --> 00:19.788
I'’m at work, I can't possibly
get away.

00:19.812 --> 00:20.986
Can he swim in his pants?

00:22.470 --> 00:24.751
Sorry, can I just ask you,
did you try calling my husband?

00:25.335 --> 00:28.269
No you just called me. Okay, no,
just wanted to know, that'’s all.

00:28.649 --> 00:31.049
Okay, I think we both know he's
going to be missing swimming.

00:33.102 --> 00:36.657
Yes, ugh, yeah, yeah,
it is a terrible, awful,

00:36.691 --> 00:39.349
terrible shame. It's a tragedy.

00:40.730 --> 00:44.872
Okay, alright, take care.
God bless you. Bye bye.

00:52.742 --> 00:53.743
Is that a work phone?

00:56.953 --> 00:57.953
Yes.

01:06.514 --> 01:09.207
Look. Julia. I get it.
It's hard.

01:10.242 --> 01:11.899
People say
women can have it all,

01:12.589 --> 01:13.866
but that's easy to say.

01:14.453 --> 01:16.190
And the point is,
if you'‘re hosting a dinner

01:16.214 --> 01:18.561
for 250 opticians
at the Excel centre,

01:18.871 --> 01:20.591
it probably means you'’re missing
bath time.

01:21.253 --> 01:23.373
You constantly feel like
you'’re letting someone down.

01:24.532 --> 01:25.602
I get it.

01:26.914 --> 01:29.158
That is it, exactly
that... that is it, that's it.

01:29.192 --> 01:30.193
I've got kids myself.

01:31.367 --> 01:34.611
And I come from a family
of very strong, strong women.

01:36.234 --> 01:37.274
So I really do understand.

01:39.823 --> 01:41.480
- So just sort it out.
- Yeah.

01:51.525 --> 01:52.905
What's with all
the cleaning stuff?

01:53.354 --> 01:55.322
Oh, it's date night tonight.

01:55.563 --> 01:57.123
How much jizzing are you
planning to do?

01:57.324 --> 02:00.189
Yeah, no, I just want
to get the whole house spotless

02:00.223 --> 02:02.156
so Jill isn't distracted
by any of that stuff.

02:02.881 --> 02:04.883
And she can't forget like
she did last time

02:04.917 --> 02:06.264
because I've put it in her iCal.

02:07.851 --> 02:09.784
I didn't have you down
as a sexual person, Kevin.

02:10.268 --> 02:12.201
Oh, yeah. Very much so.
Absolutely.

02:12.822 --> 02:14.686
It's important isn't it,
when you've had kids?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.515
To make time for each other,
physically.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.460
I thought we could do it
in the shower tonight.

02:19.484 --> 02:20.804
She used to love that
in the '90s.

02:21.693 --> 02:23.488
Just have to give it
a good scrub first.

02:25.559 --> 02:28.182
- Do you do wine here?
- We do an elderflower pressé.

02:28.769 --> 02:30.357
No, you've completely
misunderstood me.

02:30.598 --> 02:33.291
Do I look like I've been crying?
I got a bit emotional at work.

02:33.325 --> 02:34.292
What happened?

02:34.326 --> 02:36.811
I just had a full on talking
to from my boss.

02:36.846 --> 02:39.711
Is that good or, sorry,
is that bad?

02:39.745 --> 02:41.989
It's bad, it's shit! I'm hanging
on by a thread here.

02:42.023 --> 02:44.036
I really need some childcare
but I don't have any time

02:44.060 --> 02:45.820
to find any childcare.
I just need some time.

02:45.855 --> 02:47.201
You should do what Amanda does,

02:48.375 --> 02:50.495
Monday, her kids go to her
mother-in-law after school,

02:50.584 --> 02:52.907
Tuesday, she does a nanny share
with a family on their street,

02:52.931 --> 02:54.967
Wednesday, she does a half day,

02:55.002 --> 02:57.004
Thursday, it'’s either
the nanny share or her,

02:57.038 --> 02:59.386
or the mother of the other
family, they take it in turns,

02:59.420 --> 03:01.871
which just leaves one Thursday
a month, which they rotate.

03:02.251 --> 03:05.840
And Fridays every fourth weekend
her mum comes over from Portugal

03:05.875 --> 03:08.533
so that'’s covered, and the other
Fridays, Johnny works from home

03:08.567 --> 03:11.605
or Amanda takes the day off,
and I believe

03:11.639 --> 03:13.745
she catches up with everything
else on the Saturday.

03:15.678 --> 03:17.956
Okay. I'll just do that then.

03:20.924 --> 03:22.616
Do you mind if we take
this table?

03:22.650 --> 03:24.007
There's a smaller table free
over there

03:24.031 --> 03:25.964
and there's a lot of us
and only one of you?

03:25.998 --> 03:28.587
Ah, it'’s just this table
is right next to the socket.

03:28.898 --> 03:31.383
Oh, what? A plug?
There's a plug down there?

03:31.418 --> 03:32.567
I should have brought
my ironing.

03:32.591 --> 03:34.283
Really make the most
of that fucking plug.

03:34.317 --> 03:35.629
Come on, mate. Move it.

03:36.423 --> 03:38.701
Are you free on Saturday?
It's Ivy's birthday.

03:38.735 --> 03:40.289
That'd be lovely.
What are you doing?

03:40.668 --> 03:43.568
Oh, nothing special, just
a few friends at Pizza Express.

03:43.602 --> 03:45.432
She's only nine,
it'’s not like it's her 40th.

03:45.466 --> 03:46.743
You're missing a trick there.

03:49.712 --> 03:51.748
I should really invite
Amanda's kids.

03:52.404 --> 03:53.612
I think she's still pissed off

03:53.647 --> 03:55.407
about having to make us
an omelet that time.

03:55.718 --> 03:57.271
She won'’t be in a minute.
Hang on.

04:00.309 --> 04:02.897
All right?
Just grabbing the milk.

04:04.347 --> 04:08.282
God, you look thin.
Have you been ill or something?

04:08.972 --> 04:10.974
No, no I haven'’t.

04:11.527 --> 04:15.082
Really? That's mad!
Yeah, you look dangerously thin.

04:15.116 --> 04:17.740
- Aww. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.576
What did you mean when
you said I was missing a trick?

04:26.611 --> 04:29.303
You got childcare issues,
you should throw a big party.

04:29.338 --> 04:30.304
What? Why?

04:30.339 --> 04:33.480
You invite 30 kids,
you get 30 invites back.

04:33.514 --> 04:34.929
That'’s free childcare.

04:35.136 --> 04:37.484
I'm having a lovely afternoon
without my son right now.

04:37.518 --> 04:38.657
How does that even work?

04:39.106 --> 04:41.315
The parents have to stay,
don'’t they?

04:41.350 --> 04:44.560
No it's drop offs. You gift them
a drop off party

04:44.594 --> 04:46.954
and then it's quid pro quo,
they let you drop off in return.

04:47.666 --> 04:51.118
Liz! I haven'’t got time
to organize a massive party.

04:51.152 --> 04:54.501
You'’ve got time! You buy
four caterpillar cakes from Asda

04:54.535 --> 04:56.951
put them together in one long
human centipede-type

04:56.986 --> 04:59.402
caterpillar cake, then just let
the kids help themselves.

04:59.713 --> 05:00.966
Don'’t even bother with a knife,

05:00.990 --> 05:03.303
just let 'em dig
their creepy little fingers in.

05:03.717 --> 05:06.789
Then tell 'em you've hidden
a quid somewhere and relax.

05:07.030 --> 05:09.654
Then for the big finale,
play "Gangnam Style"

05:09.688 --> 05:12.864
and give them undiluted squash.
They'll go fucking mental.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.073
It's all over by 4:00 p.m. Done.

05:15.901 --> 05:18.352
We hired a Ceramic Cafe.
So same principal,

05:18.387 --> 05:20.665
but everyone goes home
with an ash tray.

05:21.493 --> 05:23.564
Yeah, well, I think that sounds
absolutely hideous.

05:23.599 --> 05:25.159
I'm just gonna stick
with Pizza Express.

05:28.397 --> 05:30.778
Hey. Hiya. Hey. Heyoo! Uh, so,

05:30.813 --> 05:34.713
I'm having a little birthday
thing for Ivy on Saturday.

05:34.748 --> 05:37.785
- Uh, Pizza Express, if you-—
- Oh, Pizza Express?

05:37.820 --> 05:40.167
That'’s a good idea. So much
easier than going to all

05:40.201 --> 05:42.100
the trouble of organizing
a real proper party.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.481
And you're not really

05:43.515 --> 05:45.034
a kid's party person are you,
Julia?

05:49.072 --> 05:53.974
Yeah, I kids party.
I kids party real hard.

05:54.699 --> 05:56.499
In fact, you didn't let me
finish my sentence,

05:57.564 --> 06:01.119
I was gonna say
that Pizza Express is great

06:01.153 --> 06:03.473
if you like that kind of thing,
but what I've been planning

06:03.501 --> 06:07.021
for quite some time now
is a massive fuck off party

06:07.056 --> 06:08.816
on Saturday. At mine.

06:09.230 --> 06:10.230
What's the theme?

06:10.818 --> 06:11.818
Tarts and vicars.

06:14.201 --> 06:17.860
I'’m joking Anne, that's a joke.
There's no um, there's no theme.

06:17.894 --> 06:19.448
It's a BYO theme.

06:21.622 --> 06:23.383
Fine. Pirate robots! Yeah.

06:26.903 --> 06:28.698
So I'’m having a party.
It's fine.

06:28.974 --> 06:32.219
I organize events for a living.
So that will be absolutely fine.

06:32.564 --> 06:34.083
- Can you help me, please?
- Nope.

06:46.475 --> 06:48.580
- Hello, Julia.
- Hello, mother. Who'’s this?

06:48.615 --> 06:50.755
- This is my friend, Sylvie.
- Never heard of her.

06:51.721 --> 06:54.172
- Where are the kids?
- Well, your kid is here,

06:54.586 --> 06:55.770
standing in front of you,
wondering why

06:55.794 --> 06:57.002
I'm struggling to cope.

06:58.245 --> 07:00.485
While you'’re bumming around,
eating smoked salmon quiche

07:00.696 --> 07:02.076
without a bloody care
in the world.

07:02.870 --> 07:03.940
Sorry about this, Sylvie.

07:05.045 --> 07:06.816
So I came here to invite you
to Ivy's birthday party.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.221
- It's on Saturday.
- Oh. Thanks, I'’d like that.

07:09.256 --> 07:10.682
- What time?
- Well, it starts at two.

07:10.706 --> 07:12.121
But get there for, I dunno, ten?

07:14.537 --> 07:15.573
What?

07:16.850 --> 07:19.250
I know what you're trying to do,
Julia, and the answer is no.

07:20.854 --> 07:24.478
I'm not trying to do anything,
Mother. What am I trying to do?

07:24.513 --> 07:25.835
You want me to help
with the party.

07:25.859 --> 07:27.550
- No, I don't.
- Well, why do I need

07:27.585 --> 07:28.758
- to be there at ten?
- Need?

07:31.381 --> 07:33.861
I don't need anything, Mother,
please don't try and twist this.

07:33.901 --> 07:35.800
What I want, actually to be
perfectly honest,

07:35.834 --> 07:37.491
what I want
is my children's grandmother,

07:38.112 --> 07:40.114
to want to be there. At ten.

07:40.149 --> 07:41.949
And to maybe bring some balloons
or something.

07:42.807 --> 07:43.808
No, Julia.

07:45.948 --> 07:48.260
Okay, how about this,
just one last job,

07:48.295 --> 07:50.273
and then you'’re free,
you'’re out. How about that?

07:50.297 --> 07:52.679
Just one last job,
for old time's sake?

07:54.163 --> 07:56.786
- I'll see you at two.
- Unbelievable.

07:58.132 --> 07:59.755
Sylvie, would you like to come?

07:59.789 --> 08:01.549
- Well, I...
- You'd have to be there at ten.

08:06.244 --> 08:10.731
Delivery. Cake. Icing. Candles.

08:10.766 --> 08:14.804
Squash. Music. Games. Balloons.

08:43.592 --> 08:46.560
Hey gang, it'’s big balloon Barry
here and I'’m going to teach you

08:46.595 --> 08:48.148
how to blow up one of these
bad boys.

08:48.597 --> 08:50.298
So what you wanna do
make it all stretched out,

08:50.322 --> 08:52.117
- and you want to work from
- Shh!

08:52.152 --> 08:53.647
The diaphragm,
really get the control up,

08:53.671 --> 08:55.120
really focus the breathing

08:55.604 --> 08:57.640
so you're at a good seal
with your lips.

08:57.675 --> 09:00.263
Okay, it'’s very important.
Okay, so here we go.

09:12.344 --> 09:15.624
This is fun, isn't it?
This is gonna be good I think.

09:15.658 --> 09:17.936
Can you stop doing that? Right,

09:17.971 --> 09:19.731
let'’s have
a little checkity check.

09:20.905 --> 09:23.079
Yeah, it's still a Minion,
isn't it?

09:25.392 --> 09:27.290
Where is the delivery guy?

09:31.225 --> 09:32.813
The delivery guy...

09:34.850 --> 09:37.266
he'’s not here.

09:37.784 --> 09:40.718
Crisps, Twix, hummus,
breadsticks, tzatziki, wine,

09:40.752 --> 09:43.410
carrot batons,
none of that stuff is here.

09:44.445 --> 09:46.378
Yes, of course,
I confirmed the order.

09:47.759 --> 09:51.176
Oh, God! I'm doing it now.
I'’ve just done it! Where is it?

09:52.937 --> 09:56.250
Oh, what? That's terrible.
What they didn't turn up at all?

09:56.285 --> 09:59.771
No, no they didn't, Paul. Look,
is there any way you could just

09:59.806 --> 10:02.222
miss this one match and just
get me supplies, could you?

10:02.740 --> 10:04.189
But I'’ve got a seat in a box.

10:04.224 --> 10:05.915
It was my Christmas present
from Dan.

10:05.950 --> 10:07.203
Oh, okay, don't worry
about it Paul,

10:07.227 --> 10:08.953
I mean, I'’ve got a tub
of cottage cheese

10:08.987 --> 10:10.644
and half a mackerel
in the fridge.

10:11.024 --> 10:13.095
It's a good job I invited
our lord Jesus Christ

10:13.129 --> 10:15.338
because I really think this
is going to work out!

10:15.684 --> 10:18.687
Don't be like that. I didn't ask
for an early kick off.

10:18.721 --> 10:21.448
Blame bloody Sky, or BT Sport,
or whatever.

10:21.482 --> 10:22.967
That's the problem
with football,

10:23.243 --> 10:24.865
so much contempt for the fans.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.212
I don't know what you're talking
about now!

10:27.972 --> 10:30.215
Can you help me or not?

10:30.250 --> 10:32.424
Look, I can't be in two places
at once, can I?

10:32.459 --> 10:35.117
I'll be there tomorrow
for her actual birthday.

10:36.256 --> 10:38.914
Look, I know it all seems a bit
of a mess right now

10:38.948 --> 10:41.744
but it's just a case of learning
how to juggle everything.

10:41.779 --> 10:44.885
And if you drop something,
I will always be there

10:44.920 --> 10:47.336
to pick it up and toss it back
to you

10:47.370 --> 10:48.958
so you can just
keep on juggling, okay?

10:52.203 --> 10:53.203
Julia?

10:54.550 --> 10:55.724
Julia?

10:56.828 --> 10:59.037
This is a bag of choking hazards
for the party bags.

10:59.348 --> 11:00.867
And give them out at the end,

11:00.901 --> 11:02.327
that'’s the sign everyone has
to piss off.

11:02.351 --> 11:04.180
Oh, God, thanks, Liz.
How much do I owe you?

11:04.215 --> 11:06.286
One pound. God bless Poundland.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.459
No, I mean for everything?

11:07.494 --> 11:11.222
Oh, right. Five pound.
God Bless Poundland.

11:12.154 --> 11:14.087
Right, there's four caterpillar
cakes in there...

11:14.121 --> 11:15.985
No! I've made a Minion cake.

11:16.020 --> 11:17.204
You wouldn't know it's a Minion

11:17.228 --> 11:18.885
but I really think it'll pass
as a cake.

11:18.919 --> 11:20.119
Looks like an angry sweetcorn.

11:20.887 --> 11:22.785
- How long have we got?
- Half an hour.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.407
- You having the party in there?
- Yes.

11:24.442 --> 11:25.685
Give me a pound coin.

11:29.792 --> 11:31.483
Write a sign that says,
"Find the pound".

11:33.934 --> 11:36.143
- What about that room?
- No, no! That is out of bounds.

11:36.178 --> 11:37.835
Write a sign that says,
"Wet paint".

11:37.869 --> 11:40.078
Oh, that's brilliant Liz!

11:40.113 --> 11:41.804
Oh, that'll be Kevin.
I called him too.

11:44.220 --> 11:47.292
- Kevin!
- Let's get this party started!

11:47.327 --> 11:48.742
What's that?
Is that for the party?

11:48.777 --> 11:50.813
This is a bag of carrots, Julia.

11:50.848 --> 11:52.435
- What are they for?
- You'll see.

11:54.023 --> 11:58.994
I'm going to need a small table,
a long stemmed glass, a napkin...

11:59.028 --> 12:00.133
- Hiya
- Hi, Liz.

12:00.167 --> 12:03.101
What would be great is
if you had some white gloves

12:03.136 --> 12:04.965
and a circular metal ring...

12:05.000 --> 12:06.346
Kevin, I've booked
an entertainer.

12:06.380 --> 12:08.106
Oh, you booked an entertainer.

12:09.073 --> 12:10.350
Well, I thought I could...

12:10.384 --> 12:12.431
But it'd be great if you could
help out with the sandwiches,

12:12.455 --> 12:14.112
and the, um, cleaning up.

12:15.424 --> 12:18.392
- Who've you booked?
- Um... I booked, um...

12:18.427 --> 12:20.232
the only person I could get
at short notice, um...

12:20.256 --> 12:23.363
- Animal Man.
- Animal Man? Oh, Julia.

12:23.846 --> 12:27.574
- What's wrong with Animal Man?
- He... He's... racist.

12:28.402 --> 12:31.026
And... and he's... unimaginative.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.821
What,
he'’s an unimaginative racist?

12:32.855 --> 12:34.339
Did you not read
the Google reviews?

12:34.374 --> 12:37.101
No, Kevin, I did not read
the Google reviews.

12:37.135 --> 12:39.586
Oh. Well look, don't worry,
I've got this.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.081
- I'm not worried.
- Well, you shouldn't be

12:41.105 --> 12:42.265
because I've got this, Julia.

12:47.387 --> 12:51.943
Oh God, this looks bloody great,
think we've pulled it off, mate!

12:52.254 --> 12:55.153
- Um, Ivy'’s just been sick.
- What do you mean sick?

12:55.464 --> 12:57.224
Uh, she vomited on me.

12:57.604 --> 13:00.296
And then she vomited again.
On me.

13:01.470 --> 13:03.196
- What do you mean?
- Um...

13:04.956 --> 13:06.406
I don'’t know how else to say it.

13:07.441 --> 13:08.580
How are you feeling, Ivy?

13:10.099 --> 13:12.861
Ivy?

13:13.171 --> 13:15.795
Too much icing?

13:16.692 --> 13:19.488
Don't think that's icing.
There's a bug going around.

13:19.522 --> 13:21.179
We all had it last week.

13:21.455 --> 13:23.492
I got caught short
at the chemist on Tuesday.

13:24.527 --> 13:26.184
I had to throw my leggings away.

13:27.047 --> 13:30.050
Do you want me to cancel, Ivy?
Do you want me to cancel?

13:31.086 --> 13:34.261
Because you'’re feeling ill?

13:34.952 --> 13:36.056
That'’s not a no.

13:38.127 --> 13:39.819
- What do you want to do?
- Oh, God.

13:40.095 --> 13:41.975
It's too late to cancel,
isn't it? And I just...

13:42.304 --> 13:44.409
It's too late, isn't it?
Is it too late to cancel?

13:53.729 --> 13:55.386
Have we caught you
at a bad time?

13:55.420 --> 13:57.112
No, you've caught me
at a great time.

13:57.975 --> 13:59.839
- Where'’s the birthday girl?
- She'’s...

14:00.322 --> 14:01.944
Do you have any parking permits,
Julia?

14:01.979 --> 14:04.498
Oh, God, parking permits...
No, no, it's a drop off.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.707
It's just a drop off.
You can just drop off...

14:06.742 --> 14:08.893
It's all right, I'll keep an eye
open for traffic wardens.

14:08.917 --> 14:10.722
No, it's a drop off, why are you
all coming in?

14:10.746 --> 14:12.713
- Hi!
- Hi, Okay, it'’s a drop off.

14:12.748 --> 14:15.130
It'’s just a drop off!
What are they doing?

14:15.164 --> 14:16.372
It's a drop off.

14:16.614 --> 14:18.271
Why are the mums all coming in?

14:18.305 --> 14:19.686
Yeah, looks like
they're lingering.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.136
Yeah, I think
they're gonna stay.

14:21.170 --> 14:22.389
But you said they were free
to go.

14:22.413 --> 14:23.562
That's the whole point of this!

14:23.586 --> 14:25.312
Did you put drop off
on the invites?

14:25.347 --> 14:27.142
No. No, I just... no.

14:27.176 --> 14:28.360
Well, then it's
Russian roulette.

14:28.384 --> 14:30.293
I guess you'’re buggered
because this is the first time

14:30.317 --> 14:32.192
they'’ve had permission to come
inside your house,

14:32.216 --> 14:34.149
so basically they'’re here
to judge your house.

14:35.564 --> 14:36.964
Tell me you put
a leaving time down?

14:39.361 --> 14:40.465
That'’s enough, thank you.

14:48.749 --> 14:50.130
Need to bring up a bowl for Ivy.

14:52.443 --> 14:54.203
Shit. Ivy licked that cake.

14:54.238 --> 14:56.285
She licked the cake, Liz!
No one can eat the cake, Liz!

14:56.309 --> 14:57.458
Just give them
the caterpillar cakes.

14:57.482 --> 14:59.070
Okay, yeah, great.

15:00.658 --> 15:02.971
- Where's Ivy?
- Ivy?

15:03.005 --> 15:05.559
Oh, Ivy. She's, um, she got
a bit overexcited

15:05.594 --> 15:07.561
so I put her on time out
in her room.

15:07.596 --> 15:09.287
I actually like these walls,
Julia.

15:09.322 --> 15:11.024
- What color are they?
- What color are they?

15:11.048 --> 15:13.291
They're the color that you see,
they're that color.

15:13.326 --> 15:15.776
I was thinking about doing a bit
of a turn for the kids

15:15.811 --> 15:18.124
before Animal Man gets here?
If he gets here,

15:18.158 --> 15:20.091
I mean, I'’ve not read
one Google review

15:20.126 --> 15:21.196
that said he wasn't late.

15:21.230 --> 15:23.646
Yes, by all means...
Just a bit, yes.

15:28.237 --> 15:30.550
- So what have we all got?
- A carrot.

15:30.584 --> 15:33.208
A carrot? A boring old carrot?

15:33.691 --> 15:36.349
Well, maybe not as boring
as you thought when you realize

15:36.383 --> 15:38.144
you can turn a carrot...

15:40.560 --> 15:42.182
into a recorder?

15:43.701 --> 15:45.565
Are we ready to make a recorder?

15:47.360 --> 15:51.088
Oh! Julia, Julia! I'm going
to need a few very sharp knives.

15:51.295 --> 15:53.495
No, Kevin, I'm not handing out
sharp knives to children.

15:54.781 --> 15:56.679
Oh, yeah,
that might be dangerous.

15:57.301 --> 16:00.718
Um, what am I going to do?
I can't do them all myself.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.340
This one took hours...

16:04.618 --> 16:06.724
Okay, I know, I know, um,

16:07.345 --> 16:10.417
let'’s play "Guess That Tune".
Who knows this one?

16:24.466 --> 16:27.641
- Look who's here!
- Who wants to see

16:27.883 --> 16:29.298
what's in the box?

16:29.333 --> 16:30.472
- Me!
- Come on!

16:41.103 --> 16:42.103
Is it no limits?

16:44.244 --> 16:46.419
She thinks
because it's cranberry glass,

16:46.626 --> 16:50.112
it'll go for 20 quid, but she'll
get seven for it tops,

16:50.147 --> 16:53.357
mark my words. I've seen
this episode already.

16:53.633 --> 16:54.737
How is she?

16:55.117 --> 16:57.188
Just had another little mini vom
earlier.

16:57.223 --> 16:59.063
Well, she hasn'’t got
a temperature so that'’s good.

16:59.087 --> 17:01.168
Look, you don't have to sit up
here, I can take over...

17:01.192 --> 17:03.367
No, I'm having a nice time.
Ivy's having a nice time.

17:03.401 --> 17:04.747
This is my kind of party.

17:05.369 --> 17:06.725
Plus, I owe the Animal bloke
50 quid,

17:06.749 --> 17:08.486
I booked him for a party
and then didn'’t pay him.

17:08.510 --> 17:10.630
- Because he was racist?
- No, because he was rubbish.

17:10.788 --> 17:12.731
God, if I didn'’t pay people
because they were racist,

17:12.755 --> 17:14.309
I wouldn'’t have
a satellite dish,

17:14.619 --> 17:15.827
or catering at my wedding.

17:16.483 --> 17:19.314
Can you take this? I poured it
down the loo

17:19.348 --> 17:20.548
but it could do with a bleach.

17:21.730 --> 17:22.730
Tag team!

17:24.629 --> 17:27.287
I just thought Ivy might want
a peep on my carrot flute?

17:27.874 --> 17:29.874
Please don't say that
to any other children, Kevin.

17:37.263 --> 17:38.263
How was date night?

17:39.851 --> 17:40.852
Disappointing.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.131
You didn't get to use your mop?

17:43.165 --> 17:47.618
Liz. No, it's just, you know,
I'd made dinner,

17:47.652 --> 17:49.792
got the house all nice
and clean, chromed the shower.

17:50.897 --> 17:52.933
I just popped up to give
the bedroom carpet

17:52.968 --> 17:54.694
a quick vac and she walks in...

17:54.728 --> 17:56.396
I'm not sure I want to hear
this story, but go on.

17:56.420 --> 17:57.860
Well no, that's the end
of the story.

17:58.525 --> 18:00.389
She just said hello,
locked the bathroom door,

18:00.424 --> 18:01.494
had a shower by herself.

18:03.772 --> 18:05.601
Maybe it was the pressure
of date night.

18:05.636 --> 18:06.740
Maybe I just need to...

18:07.845 --> 18:10.192
loosen up a bit,
be a bit more spontaneous.

18:12.229 --> 18:15.197
You know what, I'm going to take
sex night out of the calendar,

18:15.232 --> 18:17.475
I put it in there
as a repeat event, but, uh...

18:19.305 --> 18:21.100
oh, she's already deleted it.

18:26.484 --> 18:28.245
How's everything on the road,
Anne?

18:28.279 --> 18:29.279
All clear so far!

18:31.593 --> 18:32.939
Has everyone
had a special squash?

18:33.871 --> 18:35.831
How long do you think?
No pressure. Just how long?

18:35.976 --> 18:37.609
- It takes as long as it takes.
- Perfect.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.739
- Where is Ivy?
- Ivy?

18:39.773 --> 18:41.948
- Where is she?
- She'’s, um...

18:43.398 --> 18:46.642
she's getting ready in her room.
Costume change.

18:46.677 --> 18:48.886
What are they like? Nine,
going on Brandi Glanville.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.302
I don't know who that is.

18:51.337 --> 18:53.457
You do. Yeah you do. You know
who Brandi Glanville is,

18:53.649 --> 18:54.649
from Real Housewives.

18:56.514 --> 18:58.240
You know, Brandi Glanville.

18:58.447 --> 18:59.807
She's friends
with Lisa Vanderpump.

19:01.070 --> 19:03.630
- They're not friends, I mean...
- I don't watch Real Housewives.

19:03.763 --> 19:05.558
No, no. No, me neither.

19:08.837 --> 19:11.118
Kevin, can you just put some
more crisps out or something.

19:13.842 --> 19:15.568
- Unbelievable.
- Sorry I'm late.

19:15.602 --> 19:17.880
- Four and a half hours late.
- Half an hour late.

19:17.915 --> 19:19.813
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.

19:20.987 --> 19:23.231
- You've got some cheek.
- Where'’s Ivy?

19:23.507 --> 19:27.027
Oh, it'’s "Where's Ivy"?
Two days ago it was "Who'’s Ivy?"

19:27.062 --> 19:28.236
No, it wasn'’t, Julia.

19:29.340 --> 19:31.420
If you can just put your present
in the pile, please.

19:31.549 --> 19:33.344
Mother? Mother?

19:33.379 --> 19:37.279
- Hello! Hello!
- Marion!

19:38.418 --> 19:40.765
- Kevin. Did you clean that?
- Oh, no.

19:41.663 --> 19:42.836
What's the matter with you?

19:42.871 --> 19:44.351
That is the bowl
that Ivy was sick in.

19:49.567 --> 19:52.881
Do you need a hand, Julia? Just
to make the party a bit better?

19:52.915 --> 19:55.055
No, it'’s fine!

19:55.090 --> 19:56.810
No, this is exactly how
it's supposed to be.

19:58.058 --> 19:59.538
Oh, God, did you get those
from the...

20:00.923 --> 20:02.994
- What?
- Nothing.

20:04.030 --> 20:06.205
Okay, Animal time!

20:06.688 --> 20:08.828
Hey! Hooray!

20:09.518 --> 20:13.039
Okay, right, so I'm
gonna need a volunteer for later

20:13.073 --> 20:14.592
uh, who wants to volunteer?

20:16.905 --> 20:17.975
Anyone?

20:19.839 --> 20:21.358
You! Come on up.

20:22.497 --> 20:24.740
Just stand there,
don'’t touch anything.

20:24.775 --> 20:28.365
Um, okay, right, we'’ve got lots
of wonderful animals to meet.

20:28.813 --> 20:32.610
But first we need to sing
the animal song. So,

20:33.404 --> 20:38.271
♪ Animal, animal, animal
Animal, animal ♪

20:38.961 --> 20:42.758
- Sing along then.
- ♪ Animal, animal, animal

20:42.793 --> 20:45.347
- A bit louder, come on.
- ♪ Animal, animal

20:45.382 --> 20:47.694
Yep. Okay,
now does the birthday girl

20:48.005 --> 20:49.972
want to come up and open
the first crate?

20:54.701 --> 20:55.771
Oh...

20:56.565 --> 20:57.773
In the royal box.

20:58.981 --> 21:02.916
Right then, what's
in the crate? Any guesses?

21:03.331 --> 21:05.402
- A dog?
- Dog? Not a dog?

21:06.541 --> 21:07.656
An elephant?
Need a license for that.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.026
- Hippo.
- It'’s not a hippo.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.935
Look at the size of it.
Okay, you'’re not getting it.

21:10.959 --> 21:12.385
Tell you what, I'’m gonna
give you a clue.

21:12.409 --> 21:14.031
What makes this sound...

21:17.586 --> 21:19.036
A cat!

21:19.070 --> 21:22.350
That'’s right!
Here we go, there we go.

21:22.384 --> 21:24.075
Oh, there we are, there we...

21:24.110 --> 21:28.425
Look! And then that one'’s gone.
That one's gone. That happens.

21:28.459 --> 21:31.013
Right! Okay.
So, what'’s in the next crate?

21:31.428 --> 21:32.428
Surprise us.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.327
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

21:35.535 --> 21:38.366
Right. Okay, so any guesses
on this one?

21:40.368 --> 21:42.448
Here'’s the clue, the clue is,
what makes this sound?

21:45.511 --> 21:47.582
A snake!

21:48.479 --> 21:50.585
Snake? It is...

21:51.068 --> 21:52.103
a...

21:53.415 --> 21:55.486
Siamese cat!

21:55.831 --> 21:57.592
- Yay!
- Oh, my God.

21:58.006 --> 22:00.388
It's not even Siamese.

22:01.630 --> 22:02.630
Hello!

22:03.977 --> 22:06.532
And he goes
like this, "Oh, look at me!"

22:08.603 --> 22:11.640
Through it goes! Yes!
Big round of applause!

22:13.849 --> 22:17.370
Okay! What'’s in this crate?

22:17.888 --> 22:20.546
It is... come on out!

22:20.580 --> 22:21.581
Surprise everybody!

22:22.202 --> 22:25.620
It'’s a cat. Oh, it's a cat.

22:26.068 --> 22:31.729
Woohoo! It'’s a whole cat! Oh!
Nice British one.

22:31.764 --> 22:33.179
Is it just cats?

22:33.524 --> 22:35.043
Need a top up.

22:35.077 --> 22:36.769
"Half hour show was promised,

22:36.803 --> 22:38.943
ran out of steam
at the 13 minute point."

22:39.737 --> 22:42.775
"This is a very cat-heavy show.
Not un-fun..."

22:42.809 --> 22:44.432
Well, okay, if you say so.

22:44.811 --> 22:47.055
"But if you don't like cats,
perhaps give it a swerve."

22:47.089 --> 22:50.161
- Kev, forget about him.
- Just getting a wine for Sylvie.

22:50.196 --> 22:51.853
Yeah. Sure.
As long as Sylvie's okay.

22:52.163 --> 22:53.786
Well, you invited her Julia.

22:55.857 --> 22:56.857
Shit!

22:57.928 --> 22:59.861
Because I felt sorry for her.

22:59.895 --> 23:01.966
Being friends with bloody you!

23:02.001 --> 23:04.452
Well, if there's anything
I can do to help, do say.

23:04.486 --> 23:05.636
Is there anything you can do
to help?

23:05.660 --> 23:06.844
Is there anything you can do
to help?

23:06.868 --> 23:08.708
Mother, I haven'’t got time
to give you instructions.

23:08.732 --> 23:11.113
You need to use your initiative.
Just do it!

23:22.262 --> 23:24.302
Did your wife see you cleaning
the other night, Kev?

23:24.989 --> 23:26.612
What? Uh, yeah.

23:27.164 --> 23:28.164
Right.

23:29.235 --> 23:31.435
I think I've worked out why
she won't have sex with you.

23:38.071 --> 23:39.831
There's only one sausage roll
left out there.

23:41.765 --> 23:43.939
- Anne? The window?
- Oh, God, yeah, sorry.

23:45.562 --> 23:47.667
I feel like there'’s something
wrong, Julia.

23:48.323 --> 23:49.842
Everyone is picking up on it.

23:52.327 --> 23:56.296
Has your husband left you?
Is that why Ivy'’s upstairs?

23:56.331 --> 23:58.471
She won't come down
because she'’s too devastated?

23:58.506 --> 23:59.817
No he's just at the football.

24:00.128 --> 24:01.474
Julia, I'm trying to help you.

24:02.613 --> 24:05.720
I'm just trying to understand
what's going on here.

24:05.754 --> 24:07.836
Yeah I'm just trying to make
a two foot caterpillar cake...

24:07.860 --> 24:11.104
Please, please stop trying to be
something that you're not.

24:11.139 --> 24:15.764
If nothing else, it's just
horrible to watch.

24:16.558 --> 24:19.458
It'’s cake time!

24:28.674 --> 24:30.986
- Mother, what are you doing?
- Using my initiative.

24:34.783 --> 24:37.821
- Got a new camera.
- Nice.

24:37.855 --> 24:39.961
Yeah, I used to take photos
on my phone. But,

24:39.995 --> 24:42.249
then the battery overheated
and melted the memory card, so.

24:42.273 --> 24:43.585
Oh, no.

24:44.862 --> 24:47.342
Yeah. I had photos going right
back to when my Darius was born.

24:47.555 --> 24:49.695
I even had one of my grandfather
holding Darius,

24:49.729 --> 24:52.010
literally seconds before we
switched off his life support.

24:52.732 --> 24:54.493
- Where'’s Ivy?
- Where'’s Ivy?

24:56.287 --> 24:59.290
Where'’s Ivy? For God's sake!
Mother!

24:59.325 --> 25:01.361
- But where is she?
- She'’s there!

25:01.396 --> 25:07.885
♪ Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you ♪

25:08.230 --> 25:12.269
♪ Happy birthday dear Ivy

25:12.614 --> 25:14.934
Right. I'’m going to cut this
in the kitchen way people do.

25:23.004 --> 25:25.075
Oh, it wasn'’t as moist
as I'd hoped.

25:29.389 --> 25:31.702
- Right, all packed up then.
- Great.

25:34.291 --> 25:35.982
Sorry, is that everything
or what?

25:36.017 --> 25:38.571
Oh, it'’s just that I usually get
a bit of a thank you.

25:38.882 --> 25:39.952
Thank you.

25:40.987 --> 25:42.644
- No, I meant a tip.
- Oh.

25:43.645 --> 25:45.129
Well, if I'm honest,
you were late,

25:45.164 --> 25:48.719
and if I'm also honest,
you were quite unimaginative.

25:49.617 --> 25:53.344
Uh, well I think the kids really
enjoyed all the animals.

25:53.379 --> 25:56.658
Sorry, what was that?

25:57.314 --> 25:58.936
I said

25:59.868 --> 26:01.594
Sorry, have you got something
to say?

26:01.629 --> 26:03.365
'Cause I heard all your sarky
comments during the show.

26:03.389 --> 26:04.390
"Show".

26:05.943 --> 26:08.187
Alright, mate. I don't know
what your issue is, but I...

26:08.221 --> 26:11.915
I'm not going to get into here
in front of children

26:11.949 --> 26:14.158
- and mothers, "mate".
- Okay, fine.

26:14.193 --> 26:15.273
Let's take it outside then.

26:16.644 --> 26:18.369
- Fine. Front or back?
- What?

26:20.337 --> 26:21.787
Front door or back door?

26:21.821 --> 26:23.730
Because it would be stupid
if I went to the garden

26:23.754 --> 26:24.928
and you went to the street.

26:24.962 --> 26:26.975
The front then, because that
is where my van is parked.

26:26.999 --> 26:28.932
Leave it, Kevin.
He's not worth it.

26:28.966 --> 26:30.446
It'’s alright, love,
I'’ve got this...

26:31.382 --> 26:34.075
I know you. I know you...
You owe me money.

26:34.109 --> 26:35.421
- No, I don't!
- You do.

26:35.455 --> 26:37.388
I didn't pay you
'cause your act is terrible.

26:38.044 --> 26:41.116
And you'’re racist.
If your act was amazing,

26:41.151 --> 26:44.292
I'’d put up with a tiny bit
of racism, but your act is shit.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.674
It'’s just cats, mate.

26:46.950 --> 26:49.642
Don'’t call yourself Animal Man
if you just have cats.

26:50.091 --> 26:53.266
Call yourself Cat Man.
Bloody Cat-Man-Do. There you go.

26:53.301 --> 26:54.821
That's a great name.
You can have that.

26:55.061 --> 26:56.280
That'’s gotta be worth 50 quid.

26:56.304 --> 26:58.755
Look, I will pay what she
owes you, can you just leave?

26:58.789 --> 27:00.377
No. I'm dealing with this.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.275
You go upstairs
and look after your sick kid.

27:03.863 --> 27:05.106
Ivy'’s sick.

27:06.452 --> 27:08.247
Julia, why didn'’t you cancel
the party?

27:10.905 --> 27:13.114
Well, why didn'’t you
just not come?

27:17.014 --> 27:20.846
Anyway, it was supposed to be
a drop off, so you know,

27:21.329 --> 27:22.468
quid pro quo.

27:27.404 --> 27:29.444
Kevin, would you hand out
the party bags? Thank you.

27:39.381 --> 27:40.831
Thanks for clearing up, Mum.

27:40.866 --> 27:43.800
Oh... that'’s alright.

27:44.076 --> 27:46.837
- I feel terrible.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

27:48.045 --> 27:50.461
Kids get sick,
mothers make mistakes.

27:52.084 --> 27:53.085
Come here.

28:01.127 --> 28:03.302
- Can you babysit next week?
- No.

28:03.751 --> 28:05.097
Unbelievable!
