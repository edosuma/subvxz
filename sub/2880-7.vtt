WEBVTT

00:08.600 --> 00:10.601
I've never seen him
this happy before.

00:10.603 --> 00:11.752
That's because
you've never seen him

00:11.754 --> 00:14.105
on "Restock
the Medicine Cabinet Day."

00:14.107 --> 00:15.422
Look!

00:15.424 --> 00:17.892
A new topical antihistamine
with lidocaine.

00:17.894 --> 00:19.126
Wow!

00:19.128 --> 00:21.946
I can't wait until I get a rash.

00:21.948 --> 00:26.400
Oh, Gas-X has
a new ultra strength.

00:26.402 --> 00:30.488
I guess they really do
read their mail.

00:30.490 --> 00:33.124
Hey, isn't that
Professor Proton?

00:33.126 --> 00:34.775
Oh, yeah.

00:38.446 --> 00:41.399
Look at him,
just standing in line

00:41.401 --> 00:45.136
like he wasn't moderately
famous 30 years ago.

00:45.138 --> 00:46.671
Let's go say hello.

00:46.673 --> 00:48.956
Oh, maybe we shouldn't
bother him.

00:48.958 --> 00:51.125
I'm not going to bother him,
I'm going to talk to him.

00:51.127 --> 00:54.812
He thinks there's
a difference.

00:54.814 --> 00:56.063
Arthur?

00:56.065 --> 00:57.815
Arthur, it's me--

00:57.817 --> 00:59.150
Sheldon Cooper.

00:59.152 --> 01:02.770
You may not remember because
of your advanced age.

01:02.772 --> 01:06.440
Trust me, I... I remember.

01:06.442 --> 01:08.492
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

01:08.494 --> 01:10.861
Amy, this is television legend
Arthur Jeffries.

01:10.863 --> 01:14.982
His science show inspired
millions of children.

01:14.984 --> 01:16.483
Hold-Hold-Hold on.

01:16.485 --> 01:20.371
You... You have a girlfriend?

01:20.373 --> 01:23.040
Yes, and I've heard
so much about you.

01:23.042 --> 01:26.293
Hey look-- we're wearing
the same orthopedic shoes.

01:26.295 --> 01:30.330
I can't believe
I dress like a celebrity.

01:31.750 --> 01:35.770
O-Okay, I get it now.

01:35.772 --> 01:38.789
Dr. Jeffries, hello again.
Leonard Hofstadter.

01:38.791 --> 01:42.276
Oh, oh, right, I remember
your-your girlfriend.

01:44.012 --> 01:47.364
Is-Is she... is she here?

01:47.366 --> 01:49.150
No, she's not.

01:49.421 --> 01:51.459
So, what prescription
are you getting filled?

01:51.460 --> 01:52.158
Sheldon.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.183
No. Wait, I want to guess.
Don't tell me.

01:54.540 --> 01:58.042
I wasn't going to tell you.

01:58.044 --> 01:59.359
Sheldon, come on.

01:59.361 --> 02:01.195
No, no, no.
I'm really good at this.

02:01.197 --> 02:02.997
All right, give me a hint.

02:02.999 --> 02:06.533
Does it involve difficulty
initiating a stream of anything?

02:06.535 --> 02:12.273
Well, given my age, that's more
than just a lucky guess.

02:12.275 --> 02:13.891
Hey, Sheldon, let's go
mock the people

02:13.893 --> 02:17.044
buying homeopathic medicine--
you love that.

02:17.046 --> 02:18.429
But I'm hanging out
with my friend,

02:18.431 --> 02:19.379
and we're having fun.

02:19.381 --> 02:21.515
Look how happy he is.

02:53.939 --> 02:57.491
Bernie's having a girls' night
on Friday at our place.

02:57.493 --> 02:58.742
You want to do
something?

02:58.744 --> 03:01.712
Actually, I'm busy.
Doing what?

03:01.714 --> 03:04.248
There's a new sports bar
over on Colorado Ave...

03:04.250 --> 03:06.817
You're going to girls' night.
Yeah.

03:06.819 --> 03:10.120
You know they're making
jewelry right?

03:10.122 --> 03:12.573
You think <i>they</i>
came up with that?

03:12.575 --> 03:16.293
They were going to drink beer
and play darts.

03:16.295 --> 03:17.294
What's up?

03:17.296 --> 03:19.597
Not his
testosterone levels.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.348
Excuse me.

03:21.350 --> 03:23.884
I happen to be very comfortable
with my masculinity.

03:23.886 --> 03:27.104
How is that possible?

03:28.808 --> 03:33.894
Hey, I got an email
from Professor Proton.

03:33.896 --> 03:35.779
Goody!
What's it say?

03:35.781 --> 03:38.065
He's working on a paper
about nano vacuum tubes,

03:38.067 --> 03:40.767
and wants to know if I'd
take a look at it.

03:40.769 --> 03:42.769
That's strange.

03:42.771 --> 03:45.623
That he would come to you
for that and not me.

03:46.608 --> 03:48.942
Oh, I got two emails from him.

03:50.161 --> 03:55.115
"Do you have Leonard's
email address?"

03:55.117 --> 03:56.700
And...

03:56.702 --> 03:59.286
"Never mind, I found it."

04:00.288 --> 04:03.173
I can't believe
he picked you over me.

04:03.175 --> 04:05.809
You don't want to read a paper
by some old has-been

04:05.811 --> 04:09.480
who hasn't done any real
science in decades.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.115
Yeah, it's nothing
to cry about.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.851
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

04:13.853 --> 04:16.970
It's true, you'd rust.

04:20.392 --> 04:23.827
And to think I idolized
that man.

04:23.829 --> 04:25.496
And why?

04:25.498 --> 04:29.283
At the end of the day he's just
another Hollywood phony.

04:29.285 --> 04:31.335
Is it really worth
getting upset about?

04:31.337 --> 04:33.087
They say don't meet your heroes.

04:33.089 --> 04:34.705
Don't peek behind

04:34.707 --> 04:36.590
that curtain of fame
and celebrity,

04:36.592 --> 04:39.043
because if you do, you'll see
them as they really are--

04:39.045 --> 04:43.047
degenerate carnival folk.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.766
Come on, he's a retired
kids show host.

04:45.768 --> 04:46.717
That's even worse.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.886
Using the sweet
candy of science

04:48.888 --> 04:51.305
to trick children
into loving him.

04:51.307 --> 04:53.507
Pervert.

04:55.226 --> 04:57.478
Have you ever thought about

04:57.480 --> 05:00.347
why Arthur didn't want you
to read his paper?

05:00.349 --> 05:01.815
Yes, I have.

05:01.817 --> 05:03.233
And my only conclusion

05:03.235 --> 05:05.486
is the prescription he was
picking up the other day

05:05.488 --> 05:08.021
was for cuckoo pills.

05:08.023 --> 05:11.408
Maybe he found you,
um, a bit much.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.877
That's kind of a stretch.

05:13.879 --> 05:15.529
Look, when it comes

05:15.531 --> 05:17.965
to social skills, I've
mastered the big three.

05:17.967 --> 05:19.833
There's the coy smile.

05:22.036 --> 05:23.470
There's the friendly
chuckle.

05:25.341 --> 05:28.892
There's the vocalization
of sympathy.

05:28.894 --> 05:30.728
Aw...

05:30.730 --> 05:35.382
That last one's tricky,
I'm still working on it.

05:35.384 --> 05:37.318
From what I saw the other day,

05:37.320 --> 05:39.937
I could understand
why he and...

05:39.939 --> 05:42.723
some people
might find you...

05:44.326 --> 05:46.060
What?

05:47.996 --> 05:48.996
Doesn't matter.

05:48.998 --> 05:52.065
No, go ahead, say it.

05:52.067 --> 05:54.001
I know what it is.

05:54.003 --> 05:55.502
I've heard it my whole life.

05:55.504 --> 05:56.587
The word's "annoying".

05:56.589 --> 05:57.755
Go ahead, say it.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.573
Say it.
Say I'm annoying.

05:59.575 --> 06:00.758
Sheldon...

06:00.760 --> 06:02.376
Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

06:02.378 --> 06:03.761
Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.263
I'm annoying.
I'm annoying.

06:06.265 --> 06:07.865
I'm annoying.
Yeah, now, uh...

06:07.867 --> 06:09.133
Now where
are you going?

06:09.135 --> 06:11.251
Look, you know
you want to say it-- say it.

06:11.253 --> 06:13.637
Say I'm annoying.
Go ahead, say it.

06:13.639 --> 06:17.341
Say it. Say it.
Amy, say it.

06:20.111 --> 06:22.730
Well, she can't stand it
when I'm right.

06:23.898 --> 06:25.616
This is fun.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.901
I'm going to feel like
such a vixen wearing jewelry

06:27.903 --> 06:31.121
that doesn't have a list
of medications I'm allergic to.

06:31.123 --> 06:33.073
Penny, how's it
going over there?

06:33.075 --> 06:36.627
Good-- I'm just having
little trouble with the glue.

06:37.612 --> 06:39.213
How do you not know
how to use glue?

06:39.215 --> 06:41.365
Did you ditch pre-school?

06:41.367 --> 06:44.968
Yeah, but only because I was
dating a second grader.

06:47.255 --> 06:48.789
Hello, everyone.

06:48.791 --> 06:50.724
Okay, let me have it.

06:50.726 --> 06:53.460
Let's hear all
the "Raj is a girl" jokes.

06:53.462 --> 06:54.812
Nope.

06:54.814 --> 06:57.631
Bernadette told me it isn't
nice and I'm not allowed.

06:57.633 --> 06:58.649
Thank you.

06:58.651 --> 07:00.067
So I won't be making
fun of you,

07:00.069 --> 07:01.268
or the things you like,

07:01.270 --> 07:03.737
or the fact that you
just want to have fun.

07:05.774 --> 07:08.192
Howie, stop.

07:08.194 --> 07:10.360
Come on,
look at what I'm making.

07:10.362 --> 07:13.197
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.314
I'm making a bracelet.

07:14.316 --> 07:16.116
Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

07:17.669 --> 07:21.388
You know, instead of
beads and glue,

07:21.390 --> 07:22.923
you guys can use
my soldering iron.

07:22.925 --> 07:24.591
You'd be able to make
much cooler stuff.

07:24.593 --> 07:28.161
Oh, I think we're doing
just fine, thank you.

07:28.163 --> 07:30.297
Actually, I'd kind of like to try that.
Me, too.

07:30.299 --> 07:31.432
Be right back.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.686
When did I have pistachios?

07:40.860 --> 07:41.842
Arthur.

07:41.844 --> 07:43.343
Arthur.

07:44.814 --> 07:46.480
Arthur.

07:46.482 --> 07:48.982
Door knocker.

07:48.984 --> 07:50.868
That's TV money.

07:53.288 --> 07:55.739
Sheldon,
what are you doing here?

07:55.741 --> 07:58.492
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

07:58.494 --> 08:01.295
Of course you woke me,
it's 7:30.

08:01.297 --> 08:04.364
Well, I would
have been here sooner,

08:04.366 --> 08:06.199
but for some reason your home

08:06.201 --> 08:09.503
isn't on this map
of Hollywood stars.

08:09.505 --> 08:11.505
What do you want, Sheldon?

08:11.507 --> 08:14.207
It's been pointed out
by my girlfriend

08:14.209 --> 08:17.478
that I may have been
annoying to you.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.047
She sounds like a keeper.

08:20.049 --> 08:22.816
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.

08:22.818 --> 08:24.985
I am truly sorry.

08:24.987 --> 08:27.154
All right, apology accepted.
Have a nice night.

08:27.156 --> 08:30.491
No, no, now that...
we've cleared the air,

08:30.493 --> 08:33.243
I wanted to discuss another
matter with you.

08:33.245 --> 08:35.245
Sheldon, in a couple hours,
I have to get up,

08:35.246 --> 08:39.832
pee and then wander
around the house.

08:44.238 --> 08:46.540
Well, then,
I'll make this quick.

08:46.542 --> 08:49.910
Um, I want to talk about
the paper you sent Leonard.

08:49.912 --> 08:51.845
Now, I know he said
it's promising

08:51.847 --> 08:53.597
and he's going
to collaborate on it,

08:53.599 --> 08:56.049
but now that you and I
are friends again,

08:56.051 --> 08:57.518
I am at your disposal.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.353
Frankly,
lending my name

08:59.355 --> 09:02.105
and reputation to it will help,
because a lot of people think

09:02.107 --> 09:04.474
that you're a washed-up
has-been.

09:04.476 --> 09:07.260
Or dead.

09:07.262 --> 09:10.898
I should be so lucky.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.099
So, uh, what do you say?

09:13.101 --> 09:15.202
You know, if it's
all the same with you,

09:15.204 --> 09:17.237
I think I'll stick with Leonard.

09:17.239 --> 09:19.373
It's because
I'm annoying, right?

09:19.375 --> 09:21.241
I know it is.
Say it.

09:21.243 --> 09:22.943
Say it.
Say I'm annoying.

09:22.945 --> 09:24.294
Good night.
Say it.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.446
Arthur, say it.
Say I'm annoying.

09:26.448 --> 09:28.114
Say it. Say it.

09:28.116 --> 09:30.467
I'm annoying.
Say it.

09:30.469 --> 09:33.053
You're annoying!

09:35.000 --> 09:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:46.642 --> 09:48.692
If you would have told me
when I was a kid

09:48.694 --> 09:50.528
that someday I would
be doing science

09:50.530 --> 09:53.864
next to Professor Proton,
I would not have believed you.

09:53.866 --> 09:55.332
If someone had told me

09:55.334 --> 09:57.618
that people would still
call me Professor Proton

09:57.620 --> 09:59.453
when I was 83 years old,

09:59.455 --> 10:02.189
I never would have
quit smoking.

10:04.743 --> 10:07.378
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries,
I'm just excited.

10:07.380 --> 10:10.748
This nano vacuum tube idea of
yours is really interesting.

10:10.750 --> 10:11.749
Hello, Leonard.

10:11.751 --> 10:13.467
Oh, hello, Arthur.

10:13.469 --> 10:16.036
What an odd coincidence
that you're both here.

10:16.038 --> 10:17.388
Why is it odd?

10:17.390 --> 10:20.374
Because as it just so happens,
I'm also spending the day

10:20.376 --> 10:23.377
with a beloved children's
television science personality.

10:23.379 --> 10:25.596
Isn't that right,
new friend and colleague,

10:25.598 --> 10:27.731
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

10:32.387 --> 10:35.656
Sorry, I replaced you
with a newer model.

10:36.658 --> 10:38.275
Wow, Arthur Jeffries.

10:38.277 --> 10:39.559
It's an honor
to meet you.

10:39.561 --> 10:41.779
My show never would have
happened without yours.

10:41.781 --> 10:43.998
That's what
I told my lawyers.

10:45.566 --> 10:47.334
Mr. Nye, hello.

10:47.336 --> 10:50.087
I'm sorry he got you
involved in this nonsense.

10:50.089 --> 10:53.090
He said I'd be
speaking to a class.

10:53.092 --> 10:55.426
No, I said you were
teaching someone a lesson.

10:55.428 --> 10:56.627
Now let's go.

10:58.296 --> 10:59.763
What are you guys
working on?

10:59.765 --> 11:01.799
Oh, uh, we're making
nano vacuum tubes.

11:01.801 --> 11:03.050
Oh...

11:03.052 --> 11:04.584
That's interesting.

11:04.586 --> 11:06.303
Haven't you stolen
enough from me?

11:06.305 --> 11:08.806
Back off, bow tie!

11:13.895 --> 11:15.312
Hey, guys...

11:15.314 --> 11:16.947
What do you think?

11:16.949 --> 11:19.233
Wow, Penny,
good job.

11:19.235 --> 11:21.118
Thanks.
Target, $4.99.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.286
I'm getting a drink.

11:23.855 --> 11:24.922
What are you working on?

11:24.924 --> 11:26.824
Oh, I'm making
a necklace for my mom.

11:26.826 --> 11:27.908
That's sweet.

11:27.910 --> 11:29.109
Yeah, she and
my dad are

11:29.111 --> 11:30.577
going through a bit
of a rough patch,

11:30.579 --> 11:31.629
so I wanted to do
something to let her know

11:31.631 --> 11:32.796
I was thinking
about her.

11:32.798 --> 11:34.081
What's going on
with them?

11:34.083 --> 11:35.015
They're just having

11:35.017 --> 11:36.550
a little trouble
communicating.

11:36.552 --> 11:38.719
My dad says it's because
the sound of my mom's voice

11:38.721 --> 11:40.054
makes him want
to tear his ears off

11:40.056 --> 11:41.121
and sew them
over his eyes

11:41.123 --> 11:42.640
so he never has
to look at her again.

11:44.810 --> 11:45.959
Hi.

11:45.961 --> 11:47.011
Hey, guys.
Hello.

11:47.013 --> 11:48.278
Look who's here to put

11:48.280 --> 11:51.565
the "Jew" in "Jewelry Night"!

11:53.902 --> 11:56.186
Oh, sure, so it's fine
when you say it.

11:57.272 --> 11:58.238
Sorry we're late.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.606
I wanted to swing by the lab

11:59.608 --> 12:02.259
and pick up some even
cooler tools for us to use.

12:02.261 --> 12:04.161
- I didn't know you were coming again.
- Well, last week

12:04.163 --> 12:05.362
was a blast.

12:05.364 --> 12:08.582
Plus, I thought you might like
having a guy here.

12:10.869 --> 12:13.420
It was not funny.

12:14.205 --> 12:16.090
So, what tools did you bring?

12:16.092 --> 12:17.591
Everything we need
to make jewelry molds.

12:17.593 --> 12:19.360
Here's some silver,
a crucible

12:19.362 --> 12:21.378
and an acetylene torch
to melt it down.

12:21.380 --> 12:23.330
Ooh, that looks like fun.

12:23.332 --> 12:24.831
Maybe you should
master glue

12:24.833 --> 12:27.801
before you move
on to fire.

12:27.803 --> 12:29.219
Okay, who's up first?

12:29.221 --> 12:31.438
Rajesh, do you want to make
a bracelet for your mom

12:31.440 --> 12:32.556
to go with the necklace?

12:32.558 --> 12:34.058
No, thanks.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.693
I was gonna make
a necklace for my mom,

12:35.695 --> 12:38.112
but unfortunately,
she doesn't have a neck.

12:39.781 --> 12:43.016
She's just chins
and fat and feet.

12:47.489 --> 12:49.206
Okay, we're almost ready to go.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.542
Once we bond the wires,
we can test the tubes.

12:51.544 --> 12:54.828
This is so exciting,
I-I feel...

12:54.830 --> 12:57.581
like I'm 75 again.

13:01.019 --> 13:02.702
Oh, God.

13:02.704 --> 13:04.054
What... what is it?

13:04.056 --> 13:05.222
Sheldon just sent me a picture

13:05.224 --> 13:07.191
of him and Bill Nye
getting smoothies.

13:10.228 --> 13:12.379
Can-can I ask you
a question?

13:12.381 --> 13:13.480
Yeah, sure.

13:13.482 --> 13:16.166
W-Why do you put up
with Sheldon?

13:16.168 --> 13:20.070
Oh, uh, you know,
because we're friends.

13:21.489 --> 13:24.274
Why?

13:25.443 --> 13:27.277
Wow, you ask really
hard questions.

13:27.279 --> 13:28.562
Yeah.

13:28.564 --> 13:31.115
Look, I-I know
he can be aggravating,

13:31.117 --> 13:32.699
but what you have
to remember is that

13:32.701 --> 13:34.168
he's not doing it
on purpose.

13:34.170 --> 13:35.536
It's just how he is.

13:35.538 --> 13:38.722
But he's also loyal
and trustworthy

13:38.724 --> 13:40.257
and we have fun together...

13:40.259 --> 13:43.794
You... you know
you're describing a dog.

13:45.263 --> 13:47.097
He did bite me once.

13:48.516 --> 13:49.967
But in his defense,

13:49.969 --> 13:52.302
I came up behind him
while he was eating, so...

13:52.304 --> 13:54.521
Yeah, they-they hate that.

13:56.775 --> 14:00.394
You know what, Sheldon is the
smartest person I have ever met.

14:00.396 --> 14:03.647
And he's a little broken
and he needs me.

14:04.949 --> 14:07.117
I guess I need him, too.

14:07.119 --> 14:08.702
Why-why is that?

14:08.704 --> 14:11.455
Boy, you will not
let this go, will you?

14:14.160 --> 14:15.609
Oh, geez.

14:15.611 --> 14:17.327
Another photo from Sheldon?

14:17.329 --> 14:19.046
No, I have to go
pick him up.

14:19.048 --> 14:22.216
Bill Nye ditched him
at the smoothie place.

14:23.251 --> 14:26.286
He probably stole
his wallet, too.

14:30.175 --> 14:31.642
You know, if you guys
are interested,

14:31.644 --> 14:33.777
there's a technique where
I can take a lock of your hair,

14:33.779 --> 14:35.562
refine it into carbon dust,

14:35.564 --> 14:37.097
and use the hydraulic
press at work

14:37.099 --> 14:38.849
to turn it into
a tiny little diamond

14:38.851 --> 14:40.434
with your
DNA in it.

14:40.436 --> 14:42.136
Oh, that's amazing!

14:42.138 --> 14:43.654
Yeah. See Bernie's
engagement ring?

14:43.656 --> 14:46.156
That came right off
my mom's back.

14:46.158 --> 14:48.008
He's kidding.

14:48.010 --> 14:50.911
If that were true,
it'd be so much bigger.

14:53.181 --> 14:54.248
"My name is Howard.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.482
"I can make your hair
into diamonds.

14:55.484 --> 14:57.084
"My mom is morbidly obese.

14:57.086 --> 14:59.419
Everybody love me."

14:59.421 --> 15:02.222
Whoa, where is that coming from?

15:02.224 --> 15:03.624
I'll tell you
where it's coming from.

15:03.626 --> 15:06.260
All you do is make fun of me
for coming to girls' night

15:06.262 --> 15:08.045
and now you're here
ruining it for everyone.

15:08.047 --> 15:09.329
Raj, cool it...

15:09.331 --> 15:12.049
he's gonna make us
hair diamonds.

15:13.051 --> 15:14.384
How am I ruining anything?

15:14.386 --> 15:16.153
I'm just trying to help you
make better jewelry.

15:16.155 --> 15:18.305
But this isn't
about the jewelry.

15:18.307 --> 15:19.690
This is about me having a place

15:19.692 --> 15:21.725
where I can open up
about my feelings.

15:21.727 --> 15:25.062
Since when can't you
open up with me?

15:25.064 --> 15:26.613
There are just some things

15:26.615 --> 15:28.732
that I feel more comfortable
sharing with the girls,

15:28.734 --> 15:30.300
because they won't
make fun of me

15:30.302 --> 15:32.119
or and call me names,
or ask me if my

15:32.121 --> 15:34.571
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

15:37.041 --> 15:40.677
Buddy, I was just
joking around.

15:40.679 --> 15:42.579
Yeah, well, sometimes
your jokes hurt.

15:43.866 --> 15:45.215
Well, you're right.

15:45.217 --> 15:46.466
I didn't realize

15:46.468 --> 15:48.135
I was making you
feel that way.

15:49.504 --> 15:51.355
It was very brave
of you to tell me.

15:51.357 --> 15:53.307
Thank you.

15:53.309 --> 15:54.808
It wasn't easy.

15:57.078 --> 15:58.378
They're gonna
have sex

15:58.380 --> 16:01.081
before Sheldon and
I do, I know it.

16:05.570 --> 16:06.737
Arthur.

16:06.739 --> 16:08.054
Hi, Sheldon.

16:08.056 --> 16:09.907
I'm surprised
to see you here.

16:09.909 --> 16:11.658
Yeah, me, too.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.744
Somewhere around
the third floor,

16:13.746 --> 16:17.230
I began to see
a white light.

16:19.450 --> 16:20.500
I'll get Leonard.

16:20.502 --> 16:22.219
No, no,
no, I'm...

16:22.221 --> 16:24.121
I'm here...
I'm here to see you.

16:24.123 --> 16:26.256
If you're hoping to get
in touch with Bill Nye,

16:26.258 --> 16:28.208
I can't help you.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.509
I've been informed
that he's now

16:29.511 --> 16:32.746
Bill Nye
the Restraining Order Guy.

16:33.932 --> 16:35.215
No, I'm...

16:35.217 --> 16:38.218
I-I was thinking,
if it isn't too much trouble,

16:38.220 --> 16:41.471
I'd like to get your opinion
about my-my paper.

16:41.473 --> 16:43.440
Thank you.

16:43.442 --> 16:44.691
It would be an honor.

16:44.693 --> 16:46.476
Oh. Uh, great.

16:46.478 --> 16:48.145
Well, actually,
I don't need that.

16:48.147 --> 16:50.731
I hacked into your e-mail
account and read it.

16:51.699 --> 16:54.568
And... what did you think?

16:54.570 --> 16:57.120
Well, first,
I think the fact that

16:57.122 --> 16:59.323
you use your birthday
as a password

16:59.325 --> 17:01.742
is embarrassing.

17:01.744 --> 17:03.910
Mmm. Thank you.

17:05.296 --> 17:07.414
Second, um...

17:07.415 --> 17:09.967
I thought your
paper was inspired.

17:09.969 --> 17:13.453
Oh, well, that...
that means a lot to me.

17:13.454 --> 17:15.638
Can I invite you
in for tea?

17:15.641 --> 17:17.641
Uh, no, no.
I-I really...

17:17.643 --> 17:19.125
I have...
I have to run.

17:19.127 --> 17:20.477
Hey, Arthur.
How are you?

17:20.479 --> 17:22.628
Well, I guess one cup
wouldn't hurt.

17:30.304 --> 17:32.572
Oh, hey, buddy,
what's up?

17:32.574 --> 17:33.973
Well, I was
feeling bad

17:33.975 --> 17:35.676
about how I acted
the other night

17:35.678 --> 17:37.644
so I made you
a little something.

17:37.646 --> 17:39.363
You didn't have
to do that.

17:39.365 --> 17:40.330
Well, it was fun.

17:40.332 --> 17:41.665
I used some of
the jewelry techniques

17:41.667 --> 17:42.833
you taught us.

17:45.670 --> 17:48.588
It's a lightsaber
belt buckle.

17:48.590 --> 17:50.990
Wow, this
is so cool,

17:50.992 --> 17:53.677
Thanks.
Oh gets better.

17:56.348 --> 17:58.348
Wow!

17:58.350 --> 17:59.666
And that's not even
the best part.

17:59.668 --> 18:01.167
See?

18:01.169 --> 18:03.553
I have one, too.

18:05.106 --> 18:06.506
Check it out.

18:06.508 --> 18:08.809
You can wear yours
and we can have little sword fights

18:08.811 --> 18:10.677
whenever we want.

18:27.068 --> 18:30.537
Yeah, and my eighth favorite
episode of <i>Professor Proton</i>

18:30.539 --> 18:31.872
was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

18:31.874 --> 18:33.156
You said,
"Plop, plop,

18:33.158 --> 18:34.741
"fizz, fizz,

18:34.743 --> 18:37.044
oh, what a blast-off it is."

18:38.246 --> 18:39.296
Remember? Remember that?

18:39.298 --> 18:40.497
Remember?

18:41.883 --> 18:43.000
He can't help it.
He can't.

18:43.002 --> 18:44.334
He really can't.
Oh!

18:44.336 --> 18:45.719
Wait here.

18:45.721 --> 18:46.670
I'll get some Alka-Seltzer,

18:46.672 --> 18:47.838
we can build that rocket,

18:47.840 --> 18:49.723
and we can shoot it
at Bill Nye's house.

18:51.059 --> 18:53.310
As long as I'm not within
500 feet of it.

18:58.466 --> 18:59.900
So, you, uh...

18:59.902 --> 19:02.569
you have...
you have any...

19:02.571 --> 19:04.655
single grandmothers?

19:06.674 --> 19:08.242
Sorry, they're both married.

19:08.244 --> 19:12.229
Good.
Mmm.

19:12.231 --> 19:14.364
H-Happily?
