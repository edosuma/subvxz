00:20.854 --> 00:22.121
(VIDEO GAME BEEPING)

00:22.123 --> 00:24.256
Titans, it has come
to my attention

00:24.258 --> 00:27.526
that you have not been using
the new suggestion box.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.428
-Yeah, we are.
-All the time.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.730
"Robin stinks"
is not a suggestion.

00:31.732 --> 00:32.965
But it's true.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.666
That doesn't make it
a suggestion.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.436
"Consider a daily bath,"
or, "Wash your clothes
more regularly,"

00:37.438 --> 00:40.706
or, "Mouthwash, use it."
These are suggestions.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.174
Ah, then those!

00:42.176 --> 00:44.443
Those are the suggestions
from us.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.412
The whole reason
for the suggestion box

00:46.414 --> 00:50.416
is to have a thoughtful way
to address the flaws
in the Teen Titans.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.719
Fortunately, someone has put
a helpful suggestion in here.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.854
Hmm, that looks like
your handwriting.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.423
Well, it's not.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.658
Anonymous has suggested
that the leader of the Titans,

00:59.660 --> 01:01.126
Robin, that would be me,

01:01.128 --> 01:03.128
should teach more
life lessons.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.596
Life lessons?

01:04.598 --> 01:07.566
That sounds so inspirational
and life-affirming.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.002
Ooh, may I suggest
the teaching of the lesson

01:10.004 --> 01:11.970
regarding the value
of friendship?

01:11.972 --> 01:14.406
Sorry, dudes,
I don't have time
for lessons.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.809
I gots to hang out
with some cool
rollerblading dudes.

01:16.811 --> 01:19.011
You don't wanna learn
about friendship with us?

01:19.013 --> 01:21.280
(SCOFFS) I already know
about friendship.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.416
Be friends with cool dudes.
Later, lame-os.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.425
Uh, guys? Isn't this
destroying property?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.227
I don't wanna get in trouble.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.197
Man, you a nerd
if you don't wanna do
the graffiti on walls.

01:38.199 --> 01:41.500
Come on, other cool
rollerblading dudes.
Let's blade out.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.304
Aww.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.840
You look like
you could use
the friend.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.209
You guys aren't mad at me
for ditching you to hang out

01:50.211 --> 01:51.877
with the cool
rollerblading dudes?

01:51.879 --> 01:54.680
Nah, we know how to
rollerblade with the punches.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.883
I guess your real friends
are the ones who always
have your back.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.351
Always.

02:01.020 --> 02:05.224
That was the most boring
and obvious scenario
in the world.

02:05.226 --> 02:08.160
But at least Beast Boy
learned the good lesson.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.329
(MIMICS STARFIRE)

02:10.331 --> 02:12.064
I'm going to teach you
a real lesson.

02:12.066 --> 02:15.334
One that will benefit you
for years and years to come.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.336
Is it the importance of trust?

02:17.338 --> 02:18.470
That cheating is bad?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.405
That it's okay
to be different?

02:20.407 --> 02:23.976
To not hide
in the abandoned refrigerator
because you may suffocate?

02:23.978 --> 02:25.878
Those are all garbage lessons!

02:25.880 --> 02:28.213
Except for
the refrigerator one.
That's good to know.

02:28.215 --> 02:32.551
But those other lessons
are all super obvious facts
everybody's already learned.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.486
The lesson I'm going
to teach you is

02:34.488 --> 02:38.157
how to buy rental property
as a long term investment.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.025
Rental property?

02:40.027 --> 02:42.394
You wanna talk to us
about buying rental property?

02:42.396 --> 02:44.329
I don't even know
what that means.

02:44.331 --> 02:48.133
Rental property is
a place that you buy
that other people live in.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.002
(LAUGHING) Oh.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.470
I still don't understand.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.239
(SIGHS) Actually,
that sounds super boring, bro.

02:54.241 --> 02:57.743
Well, it is,
but no one else is teaching
this valuable information.

02:57.745 --> 03:01.313
Rental property is one of
the best ways to build equity.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.382
Please, what is the equity?

03:03.384 --> 03:05.484
Oh, you wanna jump
right in. Great!

03:05.486 --> 03:07.853
<i>Equity is the amount of</i>
<i>a property you truly own.</i>

03:07.855 --> 03:09.788
It's the difference between
your loan balance

03:09.790 --> 03:11.523
and your property's
market value.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.458
If you sold your property
and paid off the bank,

03:13.460 --> 03:15.961
the value of your equity
is what you'd walk away with.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.296
When you build equity,

03:17.298 --> 03:18.997
you increase the net value
of your asset.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.832
One way to do this
is by paying off
your mortgage...

03:20.834 --> 03:23.068
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:23.070 --> 03:24.369
Beastie's right.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.405
This sounds super boring.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.141
Yeah, you can't make me
build equity!

03:29.143 --> 03:31.443
Those words make me
feel weird.

03:31.445 --> 03:35.581
If you will excuse me,
I must rest my brain now.

03:36.749 --> 03:38.116
Huh. Okay.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.552
I thought you guys would like
to make a lot of money.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.321
-Money?
-Why didn't you just say that?

03:42.323 --> 03:45.290
I did. Equity is just
another word for money.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.692
ALL: Ooh!

03:46.694 --> 03:49.628
It is also another word
for the horsies.

that money, bro.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.936
First things first.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.738
We have to find the right
rental property to buy,

03:59.740 --> 04:02.474
and I've had my eye
on just the place.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.348
Ooh, the place
is the glorious!

04:09.350 --> 04:11.283
It's even got a doorman.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.719
What up, doorman.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.221
Guys, check out
these potted plants!

04:16.223 --> 04:17.356
So lush.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.157
We'll take it.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.326

the property we're looking at.

where bad guys live?

04:27.868 --> 04:30.335
(WHISTLING)

04:30.337 --> 04:32.204
It don't even have a doorman.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.006
Sure, it does.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.340
Howdy.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.476
Why would we buy
the rundown building?

04:37.478 --> 04:40.012
Because where other buyers
see a rundown building

04:40.014 --> 04:42.614
with leaky pipes,
bugs and Sticky Joe,

04:42.616 --> 04:44.549
I see a chance
to build equity.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.718
Oh! He said
that money word again.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.787
I wish to build
the equestrian.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.023
Great! Let's put in
a lowball offer
and see if they take it.

to find financing.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.844
Stop using words
that don't make any sense!

05:12.846 --> 05:15.347
Financing is how we're gonna
pay for the property.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.382
And, pray, tell,
how much is the building?

05:17.384 --> 05:18.717

what everyone else does.

I do not understand.

06:06.567 --> 06:10.502
How do we purchase
the property with only 20%
of the price?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.104
The rest will come
from a bank loan.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.673
Aww! I thought
the boring part was over!

06:14.675 --> 06:17.109
ROBIN: <i> It's all boring,</i>
<i>but fun at the same time.</i>

06:17.111 --> 06:18.844
But mostly boring.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.246
Now, let's get into
the nitty-gritty
of the loan process.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.383
The first thing we're going
to have to consider
is our credit score.

06:24.385 --> 06:27.452
A credit score is measure
of one's credit worthiness.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.154
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.256

our heads hurt, yo.

this would be easy.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.251
That's technically illegal.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.186
Renters have rights,
unfortunately.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.922
There has to be a way
to get rid of these people.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.924
We can't terminate
their leases,

09:52.926 --> 09:54.793
but maybe they'll leave
on their own.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.728
If you know what I mean.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.897
-(FEEDBACK WHINES)
<i>-Attention, villains!</i>

09:58.899 --> 10:01.800
<i>The below market rent</i>
<i>you are paying is criminal.</i>

10:01.802 --> 10:04.603
<i>Taste the justice</i>
<i>of a free market.</i>

10:04.605 --> 10:06.004
<i>Titans, evict!</i>

10:07.173 --> 10:08.273

(GROWLS)

10:12.578 --> 10:13.845
(YELLS)

10:17.416 --> 10:20.986
It is such a shame
they decided to do
the moving out.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.722
Now we can raise the rents
back to market value.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.457
We're rich!

10:25.459 --> 10:29.027
Well, not yet.
It takes decades
to actually build equity,

10:29.029 --> 10:31.930
but in 30 years,
it will provide
a modest cash flow

10:31.932 --> 10:36.267
to pay for our numerous
old people medications.

10:36.269 --> 10:40.171
This looks like a rad place
to hang out, blades.
Let's move in.

10:42.742 --> 10:45.276
-Let it fly!
-(ALL CHEERING)

10:46.245 --> 10:48.380
Hi, I'm Robin
of the Teen Titans.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.382
I know we've had a lot of
laughs today,

10:50.384 --> 10:52.651
but planning for your future
is no joke.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.520
For more information about
investing in rental property,

10:55.522 --> 10:56.621
visit your library,

10:56.623 --> 10:58.323
or talk to a local realtor.
