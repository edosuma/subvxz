WEBVTT

00:02.244 --> 00:04.411
-How was yoga, Sheila?
-Oh, terrible.

00:04.563 --> 00:06.396
The guy in front of me
wasn't wearing underwear,

00:06.415 --> 00:09.174
and his downward dog
wasn't neutered.

00:09.326 --> 00:12.368
Really?
Maybe I should take up yoga.

00:12.370 --> 00:15.264
I'm feeling a little stiff.

00:16.333 --> 00:18.500
(singsongy):
Happy Saturday!

00:18.519 --> 00:19.852
What are you wearing?

00:20.003 --> 00:21.720
Oh, this?

00:21.872 --> 00:25.916
Just the coolest shirt
of the last 65 million years.

00:26.009 --> 00:29.844
And my chances of being
a grandmother have gone extinct.

00:29.938 --> 00:32.680
Max is taking me to the
natural history museum today.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.016
And I'm her date.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.443
How the hell are you in my life?

00:36.537 --> 00:39.429
Even<i> I</i> would've
picked on you in school.

00:39.523 --> 00:40.781
You're gonna stand there

00:40.933 --> 00:42.766
and tell something cold-blooded
that it's not cool?

00:42.785 --> 00:46.628
Boom! Joke and a science fact.
Take that, haters.

00:48.031 --> 00:50.624
Hey, guys.

00:50.776 --> 00:52.943
Hey. Why do you have a baby?

00:52.961 --> 00:55.112
Yeah, I don't remember
getting an Amber Alert.

00:55.130 --> 00:57.723
Oh, look at him.

00:57.874 --> 01:01.968
Oh, he's so much cuter than
you were as a baby, Katharine.

01:02.971 --> 01:06.047
No. This is my nephew, Thor.
I'm watching him for my sister.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.307
Thor? His name is Thor?

01:07.459 --> 01:10.051
Damn. Now I got
to rename my vibrator.

01:10.129 --> 01:11.812
Same.

01:11.964 --> 01:14.147
My sister married
a comic book nerd.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.966
Their vows were in Klingon.

01:16.059 --> 01:17.559
Klingon?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.745
What a couple of dorks.

01:19.896 --> 01:22.397
He's so adorable.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.641
Do you feel
any maternal stirrings,

01:24.660 --> 01:27.811
or have your ovaries turned
to stone?

01:27.904 --> 01:29.479
I am fine with babies.

01:29.498 --> 01:31.315
I just prefer the kind
that are covered in fur

01:31.333 --> 01:33.074
and fall on their feet
when you drop 'em.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.676
Do not hand her that baby.

01:35.579 --> 01:37.096
I like this getup.

01:37.247 --> 01:38.305
You want to take him for a ride?

01:38.432 --> 01:40.748
I want you
to take me for a ride.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.269
-When's your sister
picking him up?
-Tomorrow morning.

01:44.496 --> 01:46.012
But we're going
to the museum today.

01:46.165 --> 01:47.606
Dinosaurs, rocks,
stuffed animals.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.015
There's nothing there for a kid.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.017
Come on. We'll take him with us.

01:51.170 --> 01:53.337
What if he embarrasses us?

01:53.430 --> 01:55.930
He'll love it. Right, Thor?

01:56.008 --> 01:57.783
(with accent):
The God of Thunder says

01:57.934 --> 02:00.476
that sounds bitchin'!

02:01.196 --> 02:02.846
All right, I'll give it a try.

02:02.981 --> 02:04.514
I've got my eye on you.

02:04.533 --> 02:07.000
-(babbling)
-Don't you ruin this for me.

02:13.283 --> 02:15.491
I'm lovin' this kid.

02:16.362 --> 02:18.028
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:18.121 --> 02:20.030
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:20.123 --> 02:21.715
Now, Thor, some of the exhibits

02:21.867 --> 02:25.202
on early humans will feature
some tasteful nudity.

02:25.220 --> 02:27.053
-So try not to stare.
-(laughs)

02:27.148 --> 02:29.039
And definitely no touching.

02:29.057 --> 02:30.482
Learned that the hard way.

02:30.592 --> 02:32.042
Grade school field trip?

02:32.060 --> 02:33.543
Last month.

02:33.562 --> 02:36.989
So that's why the security guard
keeps following us.

02:37.140 --> 02:39.883
-(Thor cries)
-Oh.

02:39.976 --> 02:42.569
-(Max hums)
-Oh.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.070
(humming)

02:44.223 --> 02:45.647
Look at you.
Good with babies.

02:45.741 --> 02:49.226
To be fair, I do the same thing
with Carter when he's cranky.

02:49.244 --> 02:50.669
You want to hold him?

02:50.820 --> 02:54.414
Oh, no thanks. The only tiny,
whiny thing I like is Phil.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.825
Come on. Don't you just want
to eat him up?

02:57.994 --> 02:59.178
Like a little baby kebab?

02:59.254 --> 03:01.496
Mmm. (munching playfully)

03:01.590 --> 03:04.257
Yeah, that hand was down
his diaper five minutes ago.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.168
(laughs) I never realized
you're not into babies.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.262
Stop saying that.
I can be good with babies.

03:09.415 --> 03:11.356
Look, I'm here.
(gasps) I'm gone.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.934
I'm here, I'm gone.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.435
And it's fun

03:15.529 --> 03:17.696
because you haven't learned
the permanence of objects yet.

03:17.847 --> 03:19.089
See?

03:19.182 --> 03:21.033
(laughs)
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

03:21.184 --> 03:22.943
You totally get kids.

03:23.095 --> 03:24.352
I'm gonna go to the restroom

03:24.371 --> 03:25.929
before we hit
the gem and mineral exhibit

03:25.948 --> 03:28.040
because we are going
to be there a long time.

03:28.267 --> 03:30.100
I get very fired up
about igneous rocks.

03:30.118 --> 03:31.859
-Lava, fire.
-Mm. Yeah.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.119
But when you see the plaque,

03:33.214 --> 03:34.379
you're going
to erupt with laughter.

03:34.531 --> 03:36.440
-Stop it. Oy.
-Okay, that was the last one.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.124
-I pumice.
-Oy.

03:38.277 --> 03:41.628
You three are such
a cute family.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.205
-Oh, we're actually not...
-Thank you.

03:44.299 --> 03:45.949
He looks just like you.

03:45.951 --> 03:47.117
Oh, that's so sweet.

03:47.119 --> 03:48.468
He's bald and has three chins.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.787
How does she think
that's a compliment?

03:50.880 --> 03:54.291
You should see her do "Baby
Shark." It's a showstopper.

03:54.309 --> 03:55.550
You have a great day.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.602
-(Thor babbles)
-(Kat laughs softly)

03:57.755 --> 03:59.479
Why did you let her think
we're a family?

03:59.573 --> 04:02.799
Because I get looks if I say,
"Oh, this isn't my baby."

04:02.818 --> 04:04.801
Oh, that never stopped my mom
from saying it.

04:04.820 --> 04:08.038
-(Max laughs)
-(phone rings)

04:08.991 --> 04:10.082
This is my manager.

04:10.309 --> 04:11.250
-Here? Please. Yeah?
-Yeah. No.

04:11.401 --> 04:12.325
-Yeah, yeah.
-No, I just told you,

04:12.478 --> 04:13.568
-I have to... Oh.
-Hello?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.587
Yeah, now's a great time.

04:17.499 --> 04:18.982
What's with that face?

04:19.001 --> 04:20.484
Can you smell my fear?

04:20.502 --> 04:22.076
-(crying)
-Oh.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.412
Oh. Okay, uh, okay.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.173
We're gonna bounce?
We're bouncing. We're bouncing.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.250
Okay.
Is this bouncing helping you?

04:29.270 --> 04:30.918
It's making
my pee situation worse.

04:30.938 --> 04:35.999
-(Thor quiets)
-Oh. Oh. Oh, okay.

04:36.092 --> 04:37.183
That is helping.

04:37.352 --> 04:38.926
Yeah, that's a good Thor.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.946
You know what, Thor?
That's a dumb name.

04:41.097 --> 04:43.765
I'm gonna call you...

04:43.784 --> 04:45.600
Carl.

04:45.694 --> 04:47.344
That was my dad's middle name.

04:47.362 --> 04:49.604
He's a really great guy.
He's up there now.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.349
Yeah. Yeah, not up there with
that pterodactyl in the rafters,

04:52.367 --> 04:54.442
but, like, the big "up there."
(laughs)

04:54.461 --> 04:56.036
You know, I don't know
if I'm the one

04:56.130 --> 04:58.355
to be teaching you about death.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.132
However, do you remember
our conversation

05:00.208 --> 05:02.617
about object permanence?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.710
(Thor farts)

05:03.862 --> 05:06.120
Ooh. Ooh, a little baby toot.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.048
Oh, wow. That is pungent.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.474
Yeah, that was not me. (coughs)

05:09.626 --> 05:10.700
That was the baby.

05:10.794 --> 05:12.552
(laughing):
Whew. Carl.

05:12.704 --> 05:14.629
You know what?
This dam's about to break,

05:14.648 --> 05:17.524
and only one of us
is wearing a diaper. Let's go.

05:18.635 --> 05:20.710
-It's slow today.
-Yeah.

05:20.804 --> 05:22.821
Good day for Kat to take off.

05:22.972 --> 05:24.548
Uh-huh.

05:24.566 --> 05:26.399
But we're not gonna tell her
that, though, right?

05:26.493 --> 05:27.734
Hell no.

05:28.053 --> 05:30.162
I guess we could restock
the shelves in the storeroom.

05:30.313 --> 05:31.555
Yeah, we probably should.

05:31.573 --> 05:33.890
All right, well,
give me a hand with these boxes.

05:33.909 --> 05:35.625
I'm on my break.

05:37.062 --> 05:37.911
Hey, baby.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.320
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.398
I'm pretty sure
he was talking to me.

05:41.491 --> 05:43.842
-Well, bless your heart.
-(laughs)

05:43.993 --> 05:45.326
You pick a movie for tonight?

05:45.420 --> 05:47.904
Ooh. So, I've narrowed it down
to<i> Bride of Chucky,</i>

05:47.997 --> 05:49.239
<i> Seed of Chucky,</i>

05:49.257 --> 05:51.408
-or<i> Cult of Chucky.</i>
-Mm.

05:51.426 --> 05:53.000
Ah, yes. Chucky.

05:53.095 --> 05:55.095
-Like a Murder-Me Elmo.
-(Randi laughs)

05:55.247 --> 05:56.355
And, Phil, you are helping me

05:56.540 --> 05:57.914
when you're done
with your break.

05:57.933 --> 06:02.102
Of course. I just hope you don't
finish before I'm back.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.364
I can't wait to watch the movie
with you tonight, baby.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.091
Smart move
watching a horror movie

06:08.260 --> 06:10.035
so your girl snuggles up
all close to you

06:10.186 --> 06:12.095
during the scary bits.

06:12.114 --> 06:17.434
Scary bits is also what I call
a woman's private parts.

06:17.452 --> 06:21.271
Phil, you ever told a lie
on a first date?

06:21.289 --> 06:24.883
I don't think I've ever told
the<i> truth</i> on a first date.

06:25.034 --> 06:27.034
Between you and me,
I hate horror movies.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.036
But Randi said she loved them
on our first date,

06:29.114 --> 06:32.115
and I wanted
to see<i> her</i> scary bits, so...

06:32.134 --> 06:33.633
Well, why not
just tell her the truth?

06:33.785 --> 06:35.560
Because that woman has
crazy trust issues.

06:35.712 --> 06:37.378
I mean, if she knew
I lied about one thing,

06:37.472 --> 06:39.046
she'll think I lied
about a lot of things.

06:39.141 --> 06:40.640
Did you lie
about a lot of things?

06:40.734 --> 06:41.883
Of course I did.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.476
I mean, "I like scary movies"
led to

06:43.629 --> 06:45.812
"I like Milk Duds
just like you" led to

06:45.964 --> 06:48.407
"Yeah, I like camping."
Camping, Phil.

06:48.634 --> 06:50.467
Do you know what happens
to people who go camping?

06:50.560 --> 06:52.744
I do, because I've seen
every damn horror movie.

06:52.896 --> 06:54.821
And you know
who they kill first?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.416
The handsome, funny Black guy.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.401
You know what candy I like?

07:00.495 --> 07:02.087
Sour Patch Kids.

07:02.314 --> 07:04.330
They're my body shape,
and I feel seen.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.741
Maybe I should be
dating you, Phil.

07:06.835 --> 07:09.386
I knew you'd come around, baby.

07:12.582 --> 07:15.917
Okay, Carl,
welcome to the ladies' room,

07:15.994 --> 07:17.177
where the seats are always down,

07:17.329 --> 07:19.086
and toilet paper is the currency
of the realm.

07:19.181 --> 07:20.847
Uh,<i> pardon moi.</i>

07:20.999 --> 07:23.183
Would you mind holding
this tiny humanoid

07:23.335 --> 07:25.944
whilst I relieve myself?
(laughs)

07:26.095 --> 07:27.520
Actually, wait.
Are you a weirdo?

07:27.673 --> 07:31.032
Yes,<i> I'm</i> the weirdo.

07:32.936 --> 07:34.344
When you're a little older,
I'll tell you

07:34.362 --> 07:35.954
what your middle finger's for.

07:36.105 --> 07:38.665
All right, Carl,
let's do this.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.353
(panting)

07:44.189 --> 07:47.549
There's no shelf?
Why is there no baby shelf?

07:48.451 --> 07:50.802
Okay.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.345
Hmm.

07:53.957 --> 07:58.643
I don't think that's a very good
idea at all, but it's very cute!

08:00.481 --> 08:02.630
All right. (panting)

08:03.709 --> 08:06.651
I'm like a teenage boy trying
to get to third base.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.304
Oh, I have an idea.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.882
(gasps)
I'll make you a little nest.

08:12.901 --> 08:17.478
Fun fact-- my mother calls these
"cootie catchers." (laughs)

08:17.498 --> 08:20.223
And she calls this sweater...
(laughs)

08:20.242 --> 08:23.393
a "loneliness catcher."

08:23.486 --> 08:27.747
(gasps)
Here we go. Here we go.

08:27.899 --> 08:29.399
Okay. All right.

08:29.568 --> 08:32.677
Now, Carl, here's the thing.
I'm a little pee shy, so...

08:32.829 --> 08:35.405
Carl? Carl?

08:35.423 --> 08:37.164
Oh, yeah. Hi.

08:37.333 --> 08:40.001
Um, can you roll that baby
back to me?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.604
Also, I like your shoes.

08:47.919 --> 08:49.677
Okay, if Uncle Max asks
if I put you

08:49.771 --> 08:52.605
on the filthy, pee-pee
bathroom floor, what do you say?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.274
Exactly. Perfect.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.426
Okay. Sorry about that.
Everything go okay?

08:56.444 --> 08:59.371
Yeah. Easy-breezy,
no trouble, double-bubble.

08:59.522 --> 09:02.541
Well, I don't know if this
is your pee or floor pee,

09:02.692 --> 09:05.502
but it doesn't matter.
It's still pee.

09:07.939 --> 09:09.714
Oh, damn it.

09:09.941 --> 09:11.967
Hmm.

09:14.796 --> 09:16.721
Ready?

09:16.873 --> 09:19.616
(whirring)

09:19.634 --> 09:22.561
(laughing)

09:24.639 --> 09:26.398
(laughing)

09:26.549 --> 09:28.416
Yeah, so, Carl and I have
just been hanging out.

09:28.493 --> 09:31.552
Oh, by the way,
Thor goes by "Carl" now.

09:31.646 --> 09:35.240
And what if I told you, you
never had to buy a towel again?

09:35.317 --> 09:36.966
We got to get out of here.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.151
What do you mean?

09:38.303 --> 09:40.245
Did you steal a moon rock?
I did, too!

09:40.472 --> 09:42.472
If we get caught,
blame the baby.

09:42.565 --> 09:44.824
My manager's shopping
a song around,

09:44.976 --> 09:46.826
and Miranda Lambert
might be interested.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.253
Oh, that's big.

09:48.404 --> 09:51.773
Not unlike the moon rock
that Carl hid in his diaper bag.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.333
I need to change the lyrics
by the end of the day.

09:53.501 --> 09:54.575
It was about a truck,

09:54.595 --> 09:56.577
and now, it needs
to be about infertility.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.412
But what are you gonna do
with Carl?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.840
I was thinking
maybe you could help?

10:00.992 --> 10:02.008
Oh, I don't know, Max.

10:02.177 --> 10:03.493
No. Like you just said--

10:03.586 --> 10:06.179
easy-breezy,
no trouble, double-bubble.

10:06.331 --> 10:08.514
Don't use my love
of wordplay against me.

10:08.667 --> 10:11.276
Please. Really need you.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.020
Oh, don't look at me like that.

10:14.172 --> 10:15.280
What do you mean?

10:15.431 --> 10:17.741
Carl, do you know
what she means?

10:19.102 --> 10:21.010
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

10:21.029 --> 10:23.029
Great. You mean babysit, right?

10:23.181 --> 10:25.181
Not drop him off
at the fire station?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.142
Max, what kind of person
do you think I am?

10:27.144 --> 10:30.503
I'm gonna need a verbal "yes."

10:32.357 --> 10:35.800
-Ooh, popcorn.
-Not just popcorn.

10:35.952 --> 10:38.053
Great. The Duds.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.880
All right.

10:41.032 --> 10:42.456
It is<i> Chucky</i> time.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.809
Are you ready
to get your stabbing on?

10:44.961 --> 10:46.369
(laughing):
You know it.

10:46.462 --> 10:49.389
But if you want
to get really freaky,

10:49.465 --> 10:52.317
there's a new movie
featuring Dame Judi Dench.

10:52.468 --> 10:53.376
Wait. Who?

10:53.378 --> 10:55.211
You know, Dame Judi Dench.

10:55.230 --> 10:58.731
<i> Shakespeare in Love,</i>
<i> Pride and Prejudice, Chocolat.</i>

10:58.825 --> 11:01.734
Anyway, it's a rom-com.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.052
Well, is it scary?

11:03.071 --> 11:05.555
Ah, there is a fear
of commitment.

11:05.573 --> 11:06.814
That sounds boring.

11:06.908 --> 11:09.392
Might as well read a book.
Come on, let's watch.

11:09.411 --> 11:11.744
-Okay. Yeah, let's do it.
-(laughs)

11:11.897 --> 11:14.080
You know, I know
I love horror movies

11:14.232 --> 11:15.732
because I said
I love horror movies,

11:15.825 --> 11:19.402
and why would I lie about that,
but what do you love about them?

11:19.495 --> 11:20.995
-(movie music playing)
-Oh, everything.

11:21.089 --> 11:24.590
The jump scares, the blood, not
being able to sleep at night.

11:24.743 --> 11:26.592
-Ooh. (laughs)
-Uh-huh.

11:26.669 --> 11:28.594
Uh-huh.

11:28.671 --> 11:30.337
Ditto.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.174
I guess I really got into them
when I was a teenager,

11:33.193 --> 11:34.508
which makes sense
because that's when

11:34.528 --> 11:36.586
I started dealing
with depression.

11:36.604 --> 11:38.345
I guess it kind of helped me
feel something

11:38.365 --> 11:40.907
instead of being numb
all the time.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.202
Hmm. That does make sense.

11:44.429 --> 11:47.447
Plus, I cannot get enough
of screaming white people.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.458
Oh. Here comes your Dud.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.503
Yay.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.959
I have a PhD in mathematics.

12:00.111 --> 12:01.702
How am I losing
to a baby cage?

12:01.796 --> 12:05.890
You know, it would be nice
if I had another person to help.

12:06.117 --> 12:07.559
Hello?

12:07.635 --> 12:09.135
Noise-canceling.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.878
Oh, so you<i> can</i> hear me?

12:11.047 --> 12:12.731
Not a word.

12:17.220 --> 12:19.053
Stay 'n Play, my ass.

12:19.147 --> 12:22.298
Should be called
the Sweat 'n Cry.

12:22.317 --> 12:24.325
(crying)

12:25.153 --> 12:26.302
If you can't keep him quiet,

12:26.321 --> 12:27.728
I'm gonna go work
in the other room.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.655
Oh. Yeah, that's just great.
I mean, you can't even

12:29.808 --> 12:32.475
pitch in for, like, two minutes?
This baby was your idea.

12:32.494 --> 12:33.977
I'm sorry, Kat.

12:33.995 --> 12:35.587
You know I have a deadline.

12:35.738 --> 12:37.163
KAT:
Oh, well, you know what?

12:37.332 --> 12:38.982
Why don't you at least
show your face to Carl

12:39.075 --> 12:41.593
before you leave so he doesn't
forget what you look like!

12:41.820 --> 12:43.669
Why are you always so dramatic?

12:43.822 --> 12:45.096
-(crying continues)
-Oh, I'm the dramatic one?

12:45.248 --> 12:47.323
That is ridiculous. Just go!

12:47.342 --> 12:48.825
Don't have to tell me twice.

12:48.918 --> 12:50.343
I need a drink.

12:50.495 --> 12:53.420
You know what?
We don't need him.

12:53.515 --> 12:56.924
-(crying continues)
-(grunting)

12:56.943 --> 13:01.029
Oh. Ah. Okay.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.285
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh!

13:09.030 --> 13:10.696
(laughing softly)

13:10.849 --> 13:14.501
Remember earlier we talked
about the middle finger?

13:20.358 --> 13:21.448
(crying)

13:21.543 --> 13:24.544
Okay, Carl.
You ate, you burped, you farted.

13:24.696 --> 13:27.305
That's all I need to do
before I go to sleep.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.565
You leave me no choice.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.051
I'm really sorry
for what I'm about to do.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.562
(crying continues)

13:35.982 --> 13:37.223
Hello, Mother?

13:37.300 --> 13:39.150
<i> Oh, Katharine,</i>
<i> I'm so glad you called.</i>

13:39.302 --> 13:41.302
You've never said that before.
What's going on?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.988
I'm organizing a clothing drive
for the needy.

13:44.140 --> 13:47.308
Where do you keep
your mannish suits?

13:47.402 --> 13:49.052
Wait. Are you in my apartment?

13:49.145 --> 13:50.570
Why would you give me a key

13:50.664 --> 13:52.055
if you didn't want me
to go through your things?

13:52.148 --> 13:53.647
I<i> didn't</i> give you a key.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.608
Katharine, why are you calling?

13:55.760 --> 13:58.186
I need help. How do I stop
a baby from crying?

13:58.188 --> 13:59.838
I used to put you in the car.

13:59.989 --> 14:01.155
Oh. And drive around?

14:01.249 --> 14:03.675
No, and go back inside.

14:03.826 --> 14:05.326
Seriously?

14:05.420 --> 14:07.904
I cracked a window, snowflake.

14:07.922 --> 14:09.013
This is my fault for calling.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.331
<i> Yes, it is, dear.</i>

14:10.350 --> 14:12.408
All right. Goodbye, Mother.

14:12.427 --> 14:15.836
Oh. Oh, please stop crying.

14:15.930 --> 14:18.857
I'll give you 20 bucks
if you stop crying.

14:19.751 --> 14:24.845
Oh. Oh. I've got a five
and a wrinkled cat toy.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.699
Oh. Do you like that?

14:27.850 --> 14:29.108
Yeah, you do.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.035
I got a laser pointer,
we got a Roomba.

14:31.187 --> 14:32.762
We could go all night.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.615
Look at that. Yes!

14:36.451 --> 14:38.543
<i> CARTER:</i>
<i> Why am I afraid of that movie?</i>

14:38.694 --> 14:42.029
<i> He's just a doll.</i>
<i> A stupid pretend doll.</i>

14:42.123 --> 14:45.592
<i> With the knife skills</i>
<i> of a psychotic Benihana chef.</i>

14:46.535 --> 14:48.202
<i> Think happy thoughts.</i>

14:48.296 --> 14:50.371
<i> Benihana,</i>
<i> shrimp tossed in my mouth,</i>

14:50.390 --> 14:52.539
<i> making friends</i>
<i> with my table mates.</i>

14:52.559 --> 14:55.042
<i> "Well, hi, Jeff and Eileen</i>
<i> from Maryland.</i>

14:55.136 --> 14:56.969
<i>And who is this cute little...?"</i>

14:57.122 --> 14:59.230
<i> Ah! It's Chucky!</i>

14:59.457 --> 15:01.733
<i> I got to man up and tell her</i>
<i> I hate these movies.</i>

15:07.390 --> 15:08.698
Randi?

15:09.801 --> 15:11.300
What's going on?

15:11.394 --> 15:12.410
(sighs)

15:12.637 --> 15:14.412
I hate horror movies.

15:14.639 --> 15:17.490
Wha-What? You-you told me
you loved them.

15:17.642 --> 15:18.824
You-you lied to me?

15:18.977 --> 15:20.585
I'm sorry.

15:20.812 --> 15:22.420
Well,

15:22.571 --> 15:24.830
I guess I'm just going
to have to cut you off.

15:24.983 --> 15:25.757
What?

15:26.575 --> 15:29.093
-(chainsaw buzzing)
-(Carter screaming)

15:29.245 --> 15:31.596
(Carter pants loudly)

15:32.840 --> 15:34.265
<i> I'm never gonna sleep.</i>

15:34.417 --> 15:36.976
<i> I wonder what time</i>
<i> Benihana opens.</i>

15:43.351 --> 15:45.485
Hmm.

15:49.007 --> 15:50.990
Oh, hey.

15:52.268 --> 15:53.952
You two look pretty adorable.

15:54.103 --> 15:55.954
Oh. Thanks.

15:56.105 --> 15:57.956
He's a sweet little guy.

15:58.107 --> 16:00.607
If you wake him,
I'll kill you.

16:00.685 --> 16:03.686
Also, the entire left side
of my body's asleep.

16:03.705 --> 16:06.205
-Don't worry. I got him.
-Ooh.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.450
Drop a baby one time,
you never do it again.

16:09.527 --> 16:12.453
Ah. Oh, man, he's really out.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.363
Yeah, I read to him.

16:14.365 --> 16:16.140
He liked<i> Goodnight Moon,</i>

16:16.367 --> 16:17.809
but he really liked
Murray Spiegel's

16:18.036 --> 16:20.395
<i> Advanced Mathematics</i>
<i> for Engineers and Scientists.</i>

16:22.373 --> 16:23.481
Oh.

16:25.877 --> 16:28.211
I never understood why parents
like to watch their baby sleep,

16:28.229 --> 16:31.322
but now I get it.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.066
It's like I won,

16:34.219 --> 16:36.552
and you lost, Carl.
In your face.

16:36.571 --> 16:38.162
Thanks for your help.

16:38.314 --> 16:39.497
Did you finish your song?

16:39.724 --> 16:41.390
Yeah. And not to brag,

16:41.484 --> 16:43.242
but it might be the best
country song ever written

16:43.394 --> 16:45.920
-about polycystic
ovary syndrome.
-(laughs)

16:46.748 --> 16:49.156
Sorry I was so stressed earlier.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.825
Oh, stop.
We make a pretty good team.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.303
Yeah, we do.

16:56.424 --> 16:58.257
Yikes.

16:58.409 --> 16:59.909
(sniffs)
That is not sweat.

16:59.927 --> 17:01.911
No, it's not.

17:01.929 --> 17:03.187
Is... is this a cat toy?

17:03.339 --> 17:05.023
-Don't criticize me.
-I'm not crit...

17:05.174 --> 17:06.691
It's your tone.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.109
Carter?

17:17.278 --> 17:19.262
-Yeah? (screams)
-(screams)

17:19.280 --> 17:20.705
What are you doing?!

17:20.782 --> 17:21.873
Definitely not looking

17:22.100 --> 17:23.708
for a tiny, redheaded maniac.

17:23.859 --> 17:27.119
Wait. Did that movie
give you bad dreams?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.213
It did not because...

17:29.365 --> 17:31.716
I have not been asleep yet.

17:31.867 --> 17:33.867
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:34.036 --> 17:35.778
Sorry you're so soft.

17:35.797 --> 17:37.446
Soft? Please.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.783
I don't even wear a glove
when I play golf.

17:40.952 --> 17:42.618
We've watched
so many horror movies.

17:42.711 --> 17:44.620
I'm surprised
that's the one that got you.

17:44.713 --> 17:46.564
What about<i> Candyman?</i>
You weren't afraid of<i> Candyman.</i>

17:46.791 --> 17:49.734
I will jump out that window
if you say "Candyman" again!

17:49.961 --> 17:51.127
Oh, God. I just said it!

17:51.145 --> 17:53.312
Okay, what the hell is going on?

17:53.464 --> 17:54.980
(sighs)

17:55.133 --> 17:57.391
I don't like horror movies.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.409
What?

17:58.561 --> 18:00.303
If you're gonna get me
with a chainsaw,

18:00.321 --> 18:02.896
please spare the hair.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.582
But you told me you liked them.

18:04.733 --> 18:06.918
We watched all nine<i> Saw</i> movies
in one day.

18:07.145 --> 18:09.754
It was the most romantic
Valentine's ever.

18:09.905 --> 18:11.314
And I was terrified.

18:11.332 --> 18:13.091
That's why we did it
with the lights on.

18:13.242 --> 18:15.409
Plus, we had just
started dating,

18:15.428 --> 18:19.305
and you told me you loved 'em,
and I wanted you to like me.

18:20.174 --> 18:22.082
What else have you lied about?

18:22.102 --> 18:23.676
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

18:23.770 --> 18:26.086
Milk Duds. I mean,
I just swallow 'em like pills.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.331
But that's it. And camping.

18:28.349 --> 18:31.350
I mean, I know bears crap in
the woods, but why do I have to?

18:31.502 --> 18:34.170
Carter, we have been dating
for more than a year.

18:34.263 --> 18:35.688
I thought I knew you.

18:35.764 --> 18:39.283
Baby, I'm the same Carter
you said you loved yesterday.

18:39.510 --> 18:43.679
Except my real name isn't
Carter. It's Charles.

18:43.698 --> 18:44.605
Charles?!

18:44.624 --> 18:46.015
My grandma was hard of hearing.

18:46.033 --> 18:50.035
Nobody wanted to correct her,
so here we are.

18:50.188 --> 18:52.538
You are not making this better,
Charles.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.858
Come on. I'm a guy
who would do something he hates

18:55.951 --> 18:57.301
just to make you happy.

18:57.453 --> 19:00.346
Well, I want a guy
who tells me the truth.

19:01.048 --> 19:02.640
This is the truth.

19:02.791 --> 19:05.534
It took a long time
for you to take down your walls,

19:05.628 --> 19:09.689
and I was afraid if I said
anything, you'd put 'em back up.

19:13.969 --> 19:15.820
I don't like Prince.

19:15.897 --> 19:18.564
Excuse me?!

19:18.658 --> 19:22.551
He's tiny, and he's weird,
and his music ain't all that.

19:22.645 --> 19:24.978
(high-pitched gasp)

19:25.698 --> 19:27.481
But I know that he's your
favorite, and that's why

19:27.500 --> 19:30.651
I just smile and nod
whenever you put his songs on.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.171
I don't know what
to say except...

19:33.398 --> 19:37.249
this is what it sounds like
when Carter cries.

19:37.326 --> 19:40.586
-Baby, I did...
-Mm.

19:40.738 --> 19:42.054
But I'm sor...

19:48.170 --> 19:50.170
(yawning):
One latte coming right up.

19:50.264 --> 19:52.598
(yawning):
Why are you so tired?

19:52.750 --> 19:54.174
Baby. Why are you so tired?

19:54.194 --> 19:56.009
Dame Judi Dench marathon.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.087
We found a movie
where she stabs someone.

19:58.105 --> 19:59.614
It was a win for everybody.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.107
(yawning)

20:02.202 --> 20:03.275
Oh, are you tired, too?

20:03.428 --> 20:05.352
No, y'all are just boring.

20:05.446 --> 20:07.371
I never have
a bad night of sleep.

20:07.448 --> 20:10.616
The key is light stretching,
a warm bath

20:10.710 --> 20:13.118
and a handful
of cheap Canadian sedatives

20:13.271 --> 20:15.546
washed down with vodka.

20:15.698 --> 20:17.882
Hey, guys. Can I get a coffee?

20:18.109 --> 20:19.050
Oh, sure. Phil?

20:19.201 --> 20:21.427
Sorry. I just started my break.

20:23.114 --> 20:24.964
How'd the drop-off go with Carl?

20:25.116 --> 20:26.540
Did he say anything about me?

20:26.634 --> 20:28.467
Just a toot and a smile.

20:28.619 --> 20:29.894
Oh, that's so Carl.

20:30.045 --> 20:32.137
-Who's Carl?
-Oh, Carl's Thor.

20:32.232 --> 20:36.025
-Who's Thor?
-The tastiest Hemsworth.

20:36.961 --> 20:38.069
You really were great with him.

20:38.296 --> 20:40.554
Well, she learned from the best.

20:40.631 --> 20:43.557
That's right, Mother, I did.
My nanny Adela.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.244
It was kind of nice being
a little family yesterday.

20:46.395 --> 20:48.228
Yeah, I liked playing dad.

20:48.322 --> 20:49.472
I even went to the Home Depot

20:49.565 --> 20:51.064
and learned the name
of the paint guy.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.808
It was Carl.

20:52.901 --> 20:54.543
Oh.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.813
I think I want to have a baby.

20:57.982 --> 21:00.332
It's gonna make my mother
really happy,

21:00.485 --> 21:03.261
but I'm gonna do it anyway.
