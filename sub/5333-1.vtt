him leave this morning.

didn't say anything,

11:18.756 --> 11:22.007

overhear anything that might

idea of where he is?

Now what's better than
hanging out on the beach,

looking at pretty girls?

21:24.026 --> 21:26.495
I have a few questions
I want to ask Conrad Miller.

21:26.496 --> 21:30.913

I figured I'd just ask you.

All right.

Now look, Miss Wilder,

21:38.248 --> 21:41.000
just a little more information
and I'll be on my way.

21:41.001 --> 21:41.923
What would you like to know?

21:41.924 --> 21:44.968
Well, I see that you
have your house up for sale,

21:44.969 --> 21:49.717
and also a boat down at the
marina you're trying to sell.

21:49.718 --> 21:51.095
So you figured
that out in three hours.

21:51.096 --> 21:55.139
Yes, my parents left everything
to me, including the boat.

21:55.140 --> 21:58.815

could use the money.

serve me right,

22:09.911 --> 22:13.535
I see that your boyfriend
put you up to sell everything.

22:13.536 --> 22:15.662
So you and him
could run together.

22:15.663 --> 22:16.249
Seriously?

22:16.250 --> 22:19.249
He's not my boyfriend,
and I'm not running anywhere.

22:19.250 --> 22:23.128
He is your friend,
right? And he is a boy?

22:23.919 --> 22:26.422
Well, actually, I'm in the
market for buying a boat.

22:26.423 --> 22:29.799
Maybe I could come down to the
marina and take a look at yours?

22:29.800 --> 22:31.971

potential buyer at 08:00.

Laura's my best friend,

22:38.725 --> 22:41.060
and a seriously honest person.

22:41.061 --> 22:43.983
If she was hiding something,
I would know about it,

22:43.984 --> 22:44.981
and she's not, okay?

Paint our toenails...

keeping us from doing that.

nice, if I can say so myself.

36:35.687 --> 36:38.816
What, are you like
an MP or something?

36:38.940 --> 36:41.659
A real bad ass?

36:41.984 --> 36:45.696
I don't give two shits
who the fuck you are,

36:45.697 --> 36:48.701
because I'm still gonna
chop you up and feed you to

36:48.702 --> 36:51.749

36:52.370 --> 36:53.542
You know what really gets me?

36:53.543 --> 36:58.920
Really fucking gets me...
is in all that shit...

37:00.378 --> 37:02.295

37:02.296 --> 37:05.095
A lipstick canister, and I'm
like, why would he have a

37:05.096 --> 37:09.594
lipstick canister?
Oh, maybe he's a homo.

37:09.595 --> 37:10.562
You know what? I'm gonna-

37:10.563 --> 37:14.276
I'm gonna paint your lips,

lipstick, it's this.

Oh, no, try the knots, man.

37:30.283 --> 37:32.627
Yeah, I'm an
excellent knots tier.

37:32.628 --> 37:34.411
I was a Boy Scout.

37:34.412 --> 37:38.713
In fact, I got my knot-tying
badge right here.

just a bunch of clothes.

38:07.820 --> 38:10.322
And you still
haven't fucking told me

38:10.323 --> 38:12.997
how you got Junior's car!

38:13.951 --> 38:15.624

to tell that you're

38:25.505 --> 38:27.547
a fucking Marine, okay?

38:27.548 --> 38:32.052
But what gets me fucking rock
hard, is this right here.

38:32.053 --> 38:36.515
Why the fuck do you have
a Banco de Mal-dives card?

38:36.516 --> 38:38.058

fucking chainsaw, because as

39:14.637 --> 39:18.187
much as I love torturing a fool,
I got too much shit to do.

39:18.188 --> 39:22.018
And put up the fucking
no vacancy sign, okay'? Go!

39:22.019 --> 39:23.478
Okay-

39:25.323 --> 39:28.033

You look good, honey.

- Thank you.
- Really, really well.

39:50.182 --> 39:53.466
- Thank you.
- Is it the hair?

39:53.467 --> 39:56.303
Maybe the lifestyle
suits you better.

39:56.304 --> 39:58.096
I like to think so.

39:58.097 --> 39:59.931
I thought you quit.

39:59.932 --> 40:02.517
Well, I did... for a day.

40:02.518 --> 40:05.522
- Mmm.
- Conrad?

40:06.230 --> 40:07.439
Soon.

40:07.440 --> 40:10.525
- What do you need done?
- An exit.

40:10.526 --> 40:12.777
- You got it.
- Here he is.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.701
Good morning, sorry I'm late.

Thought you'd be earlier.

40:17.199 --> 40:18.158

40:19.785 --> 40:21.875
He seems to think I'm
hiding an ex-boyfriend or

something on the boat.

40:23.042 --> 40:24.664

40:24.665 --> 40:25.757
You have a warrant, Detective?

40:25.758 --> 40:28.219
No, I don't, but it's
like that vampire rule,

40:28.220 --> 40:30.629
if you invite me on,
it's legal.

40:30.630 --> 40:33.548
It's up to you, Cap.

40:33.549 --> 40:34.299
Well, make it quick.

40:34.300 --> 40:37.144
Me and this little lady have
some catching up to do.

- Help yourself.

41:28.901 --> 41:31.274
There were no fingerprints
on that picture you gave me.

41:31.275 --> 41:34.277
And there's video showing
Conrad using force on a man

41:34.278 --> 41:37.448
at a gas station.
Then he stole the man's car.

41:37.449 --> 41:39.197
(Adams) You gotta be kidding me.

41:39.198 --> 41:43.499
It's an '86 white Trans Am,

It's not adding up!

41:44.709 --> 41:47.205
I've been trying to
figure this one out, too.

41:47.206 --> 41:47.877
You get a location?

41:47.878 --> 41:51.459
Yeah, I'll text you what
I have. Be careful.

41:51.460 --> 41:53.628
(Myron) It's my

41:53.629 --> 41:54.674
Every day, it's the same shit.

41:54.675 --> 41:56.673
I put the dog on the leash,
the dog gets off the leash.

41:56.674 --> 41:59.300
I have to find the dog,
put the dog back on the leash.

41:59.301 --> 42:00.097
I'm sick of this shit.

42:00.098 --> 42:02.438

And that ass-not the dog's
ass, my girlfriend's ass.

42:08.060 --> 42:10.520

Thanks.

42:18.612 --> 42:19.158
What's happening?

42:19.159 --> 42:21.119
It seems like your
boyfriend went on a war path,

42:21.120 --> 42:23.789
stole a car, beat the
shit out of some guy.

42:23.790 --> 42:27.412
They ran the plates, miles
outside of Reyes Creek.

These girls are scared and
afraid, they need your fucking

51:47.273 --> 51:50.768
help, so pretend like
you fucking care!

51:53.228 --> 51:55.322
All eyes are on you, Ray.

52:03.697 --> 52:05.825
Lose the radio.

52:09.077 --> 52:12.331
Left hands, both
of you, cuff 'em.

52:13.498 --> 52:15.421
You, too, Ray.

52:21.965 --> 52:23.638
Over here.

52:24.092 --> 52:25.935
Stay there, Ray.

52:27.220 --> 52:29.814
Take hold of the car right now.

52:33.894 --> 52:35.394
Both hands.

52:35.395 --> 52:37.489
On the floor.

52:40.442 --> 52:42.240
Over here.

52:42.861 --> 52:44.195
Over here!

52:44.196 --> 52:46.699
- Okay?
- Do it!

52:52.746 --> 52:55.499
Oh, we're gonna get you, boy.

52:56.750 --> 52:59.253
<i>No, you won't. (Punch)</i>

52:59.711 --> 53:04.763
I hope you're a good cop,
because he's a fucking disgrace.

53:05.092 --> 53:07.060
Make him pay.

53:08.804 --> 53:10.056
It's not like that.

53:10.057 --> 53:13.685
Listen to me, it's
not like that.

53:33.745 --> 53:35.543
You know, it's crazy how
you get 20 miles outside of

53:35.544 --> 53:39.214
LA and this whole fucking
town is like a desert.

53:42.337 --> 53:43.671
(Adams) Oh, nice car.

53:43.672 --> 53:44.422
(Laura) That's him.

53:44.423 --> 53:47.927
- What you talking about?
- Step on the fucking gas!

53:48.510 --> 53:49.510
Now.

53:49.511 --> 53:51.804
Calm down, I'm doing 90.

53:51.805 --> 53:54.183
What the fuck is
wrong with you, woman?

53:54.184 --> 53:56.150
<i>(Loads gun)</i>

53:56.935 --> 53:59.437
Chase the fucking Audi now.

53:59.438 --> 54:01.361
Are you out your fucking mind?

54:01.362 --> 54:04.200
Do it, or I'll
put a bullet in you.

54:05.277 --> 54:06.360
<i>(Accelerates)</i>

54:06.361 --> 54:09.365
You're looking at ten years,
pointing a gun at a cop, girl.

54:09.366 --> 54:11.699
(Laura) Detective Adams, move!

54:11.700 --> 54:13.168
(Adams) You know how
to use that thing?

54:13.169 --> 54:15.202
<i>(Cocks gun) Want</i> to <i>test me?</i>

54:15.203 --> 54:19.299
Oh, you got a lot of
explaining to do there.

54:30.594 --> 54:33.598
Reyes Creek, ten minutes.

54:35.223 --> 54:37.146
Copy that.

54:40.771 --> 54:44.776
(Adams) You're on his tail now.
There, you happy?

54:50.071 --> 54:53.041
I don't have time
for this shit.

55:04.795 --> 55:06.889
(Adams) What's he doing?

55:17.432 --> 55:19.480
Tell me what the
fuck is going on!

55:19.481 --> 55:20.978
Move.

55:22.479 --> 55:23.981
Move!

55:24.105 --> 55:26.403
Put it in fucking drive!

55:29.027 --> 55:30.569
- Shit!
- He got a gun!

55:30.570 --> 55:33.449
(Laura) Shit! <i>(Gun</i> shots)

55:35.575 --> 55:39.205
<i>(Gun shots)</i> Get <i>him! Come on!</i>

55:39.955 --> 55:42.456
Call for back-up. Go!

55:42.457 --> 55:44.209
Never mind.

55:46.461 --> 55:47.586
(Adams) Detective
Adams, I need back-up.

55:47.587 --> 55:51.182
(Laura) Sorry, I need your car.
(Driver) Please don't hurt me.

55:51.183 --> 55:53.050
Let's go. Move it!

55:53.051 --> 55:55.135
(Adams) Shots fired!

55:55.136 --> 55:57.972
<i>Wiley! (Squealing tires)</i> Hey!

55:57.973 --> 55:59.691
What the fuck!

56:12.654 --> 56:15.498
(Cook) Pick-up order
ready, hot plate.

56:19.160 --> 56:22.835
(Waitress) Take a seat,
I'll be right with you, hon.

56:27.544 --> 56:29.461
(Conrad) Hey, brother.

56:29.462 --> 56:31.430
(Apache) You look
like shit, Miller.

56:31.431 --> 56:33.841
Thanks, man,
I feel like it, too.

56:33.842 --> 56:37.016
I was about to leave, you know?

56:38.096 --> 56:40.139
I'm glad you didn't.

56:40.140 --> 56:41.932
What the fuck happened?

56:41.933 --> 56:43.684
You would not
fucking believe it.

56:43.685 --> 56:47.815
You look like this,
trying to keep a low profile?

56:49.232 --> 56:52.076
(Conrad) Something
like that, man.

56:53.486 --> 56:56.113
I heard you got
the heat on your six.

56:56.114 --> 56:58.367
- Them reds don't play nice.
- Where did you hear?

56:58.368 --> 57:01.702
Last night, you don't
have a whole lot of time.

57:01.703 --> 57:03.203
Yeah, I know.

57:03.204 --> 57:07.084
You're a crazy
motherfucker, aren't you?

57:07.709 --> 57:10.963
You would fucking know. Smoke?

57:12.380 --> 57:17.386
Only chance I'm gonna have
to get out of this thing.

57:21.556 --> 57:24.105
Start new, you know?

57:24.392 --> 57:27.186
I gotta look after my family.

57:27.187 --> 57:28.228
Family?

57:28.229 --> 57:29.980
You're kidding me, right?

57:29.981 --> 57:31.949
She's having a baby, my friend.

57:31.950 --> 57:35.913
Then we have to have a
shot, for old time's sake.

57:36.237 --> 57:39.411
Sounds like a good idea.

57:39.658 --> 57:40.240
Babe.

57:40.241 --> 57:42.743
But just one, you bastard.
I know you.

57:42.744 --> 57:44.915
I gotta be on a plane
by sunset, okay?

57:44.916 --> 57:46.756
(Apache) All right, copy that.

57:46.757 --> 57:48.666
(Waitress) Here we go.

57:48.667 --> 57:51.261
You okay? You look
like you've had a rough day.

57:51.262 --> 57:52.711
Just a little.

57:52.712 --> 57:53.554
Can I get you anything?

57:53.555 --> 57:56.298
Do you have anything stronger
than milkshake in the back?

57:56.299 --> 57:57.925
My friend over
here needs a drink.

57:57.926 --> 58:01.305
Yeah, sure, I got a bottle
of tequila in the back room.

58:01.306 --> 58:02.643
I won't tell, if you don't.

58:02.644 --> 58:03.891
Not a peep from me.

58:03.892 --> 58:04.810
Are you new here?

58:04.811 --> 58:06.936
Yeah, I just started
a few days back.

58:06.937 --> 58:10.145
And I thought I knew
all the hot asses around here.

58:10.146 --> 58:10.567
Me, too.

58:10.568 --> 58:13.692
<i>(Laughs)I'll be right back.</i>

58:17.570 --> 58:19.616
You never fucking
change, do you?

58:19.617 --> 58:20.866
It'll kill you one day.

58:20.867 --> 58:23.038
What don't kill you
makes you stronger, right?

58:23.039 --> 58:26.078
- That's what I heard.
- You called my boy?

58:26.079 --> 58:27.956
Yeah.

58:28.164 --> 58:30.007
He's holding the wire for me.

58:30.008 --> 58:34.050
He'll do you right.
No worries. You okay?

58:35.130 --> 58:36.672
Yeah.

58:36.673 --> 58:41.427
Hey, guess to us,
no matter how far we run,

58:41.428 --> 58:45.639
we can never get away
from what we've done.

58:45.640 --> 58:47.938
I know what I've done.

58:49.644 --> 58:52.980
I just want a piece
of normal, you know?

58:52.981 --> 58:55.607
There is no normal for us.

58:55.608 --> 58:57.576
Well, we're gonna
give it a shot.

58:57.577 --> 59:01.905
You're here, you're in one
piece, you lucky son of a bitch.

59:01.906 --> 59:05.581
They don't know
about her, do they?

59:07.662 --> 59:08.829
No.

59:08.830 --> 59:11.003
Here we are, fellas.

59:11.458 --> 59:12.675
- Oohh!!
- Hey, hey, hey. It's OK.

59:12.676 --> 59:15.257
- Oh, damn it, I'm sorry!
- That's okay. I got it. Got it.

59:15.258 --> 59:18.052
- I'll get you another shot.
- Great, thanks.

59:20.467 --> 59:22.390
She's new, huh?

59:22.594 --> 59:25.179
Here's to new beginnings.

59:25.180 --> 59:27.558
Let's hope so.

59:37.734 --> 59:38.525
Fuck.

59:38.526 --> 59:40.995
You are pretty
banged up, aren't you?

59:40.996 --> 59:42.785
Yeah.

59:43.364 --> 59:45.287
You should see the other guys.

59:45.288 --> 59:47.832
- I bet.
- Mm-hm.

59:48.536 --> 59:50.959
(Apache) You got the bank card'?

59:51.873 --> 59:53.591
(Conrad) Right here.

01:00:06.262 --> 01:00:07.479
Thanks, man, I just...

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.978
No, don't even say it. But
what you did for us back then,

01:00:12.227 --> 01:00:17.404
not even in two fucking
lifetimes can we even repay you.

01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:26.326
Now get going and take
care of your old lady.

01:00:26.407 --> 01:00:29.502
That's what it's
all about, right?

01:00:29.744 --> 01:00:31.621
Yeah, it is.

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:36.133
Take care, man.

01:00:37.377 --> 01:00:39.129
Later.

01:00:39.254 --> 01:00:41.598
What the fuck?
Hey, I need some help!

01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:44.934
Turn around! Slowly.

01:00:48.805 --> 01:00:51.348
Target acquired.
Drop the weapon.

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:52.316
(Male Patron) No! Okay, okay.

01:00:52.317 --> 01:00:55.653
Set it on the table... now.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.156
The drink...

01:01:07.157 --> 01:01:10.242
you're good.
Didn't see you coming.

01:01:10.243 --> 01:01:12.369
Most men don't.

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:13.704
How'd you find me?

01:01:13.705 --> 01:01:15.799
Where's the asset?

01:01:16.124 --> 01:01:16.957
Not here.

01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:20.502
I saw him give you the envelope.
Hand it over now.

01:01:20.503 --> 01:01:23.297
There's no intel.
You're gonna get hurt.

01:01:23.298 --> 01:01:24.006
Doubt it.

01:01:24.007 --> 01:01:26.053
Do you even
know why you're here?

01:01:26.054 --> 01:01:27.220
Why you're tracking me?

01:01:27.221 --> 01:01:29.266
Not my job to know, Mr. Miller.

01:01:29.267 --> 01:01:32.639
My job is this.
Hold and detain.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.768
Don't even think about it.
One more move,

01:01:34.769 --> 01:01:38.442
and I will put one in your
leg and let you bleed out.

01:01:38.443 --> 01:01:39.646
Really?

01:01:39.647 --> 01:01:42.024
Yeah, really.

01:01:42.025 --> 01:01:45.825
See, I'm guessing
you're here, Myron.

01:01:53.703 --> 01:01:55.751
Long time.

01:01:56.414 --> 01:01:58.212
Yeah.

01:01:58.291 --> 01:02:00.959
You're a hard man to follow.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.009
You left quite a mess at
that hotel, didn't you?

01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:06.798
Yeah. He had it coming.

01:02:06.799 --> 01:02:09.259
I ran into your lovely
lady on the way up here.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.182
She was with a detective.

01:02:10.183 --> 01:02:12.146
You tell me you
didn't fucking hurt her.

01:02:12.147 --> 01:02:14.232
Of course, not.

01:02:14.307 --> 01:02:18.187
She is having a little
car trouble, though.

01:02:18.353 --> 01:02:20.776
I'm not a monster...

01:02:21.606 --> 01:02:22.814
I'm a soldier.

01:02:22.815 --> 01:02:27.036
You used to be one,
until you went AWOL.

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:29.409
If that's what
you want to call it.

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:31.615
That's what it is.

01:02:31.616 --> 01:02:33.283
Why?

01:02:33.284 --> 01:02:36.912
Because the government
tells you so? Is that it?

01:02:36.913 --> 01:02:39.710
Because they always tell
you the fucking truth?

01:02:39.711 --> 01:02:40.502
America, baby.

01:02:40.503 --> 01:02:43.879
After that Snowden shit,
they're not fucking around.

01:02:45.964 --> 01:02:49.093
Yeah, the Commies
sold you out, too.

01:02:51.469 --> 01:02:52.177
Asset?

01:02:52.178 --> 01:02:54.647
He says he doesn't have it.

01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:03.689
Let's do this
the easy way, yeah?

01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:06.233
We're both men of action.

01:03:06.234 --> 01:03:09.653
Lies do not become us, Conrad.

01:03:09.654 --> 01:03:13.079
Come on, man, you believe that?

01:03:15.076 --> 01:03:17.625
Lies are what we are, Myron.

01:03:23.251 --> 01:03:27.296
You're selling classified
information to the Russians.

01:03:27.297 --> 01:03:28.213
Come on.

01:03:28.214 --> 01:03:32.634
I'm sure it pays well, but
it's not exactly NATO friendly.

01:03:32.635 --> 01:03:35.605
Where the fuck did you
think you were gonna go?

01:03:35.606 --> 01:03:39.726
Last time I checked we weren't
in the business of friendly.

01:03:40.476 --> 01:03:43.355
You gave me
nothing to work with.

01:03:43.938 --> 01:03:47.613
Myron, I just want out, man.

01:03:48.943 --> 01:03:51.071
That's it.

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:56.997
You might want out one day.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:02.461
Myron, asset recovery,
Conrad Miller is detained.

01:04:04.125 --> 01:04:06.460
Copy that. It's a kill order.

01:04:06.461 --> 01:04:07.627
(Waitress) Move!

01:04:07.628 --> 01:04:10.381
<i>(Gun shots)</i>

01:04:33.863 --> 01:04:36.448
(Myron) It's already
over, Conrad.

01:04:36.449 --> 01:04:38.998
There's nowhere to go.

01:04:39.952 --> 01:04:41.795
<i>(Gun shots)</i>

01:04:47.543 --> 01:04:49.716
Hold this position.

01:05:56.571 --> 01:05:58.780
I know you're out here, Conrad.

01:05:58.781 --> 01:06:01.000
Can we please get
this over with?

01:06:01.001 --> 01:06:04.041
This hiding shit is beneath you.

01:07:02.637 --> 01:07:04.221
You're hit.

01:07:04.222 --> 01:07:06.473
I know you're hit.

01:07:06.474 --> 01:07:09.273
You're gonna bleed out.

01:07:10.937 --> 01:07:13.315
Conrad, come out!

01:07:44.971 --> 01:07:46.391
I lost him. Anything there?

01:07:46.392 --> 01:07:47.514
Nothing back here.

01:07:47.515 --> 01:07:49.062
He'll probably
circle back there.

01:07:49.063 --> 01:07:52.477
He has no other place to go.
If you do engage...

01:07:52.478 --> 01:07:56.189
put him down!
Stay sharp, I'm on my way.

01:09:25.988 --> 01:09:28.582

Motherfucker,
that's my gun hand.

Good to see you, baby.

Yeah...

It's different now.

01:12:04.855 --> 01:12:08.826
Inactive doesn't mean
I lost my touch, baby.

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:14.953
Copy that.

01:12:15.783 --> 01:12:18.535
(Reporter) See if we can get
an interview with these guys.

01:12:18.536 --> 01:12:20.288
(Officer) Step away,
please, no pictures.

01:12:20.289 --> 01:12:23.166
(Adams) The customer said he saw
Conrad sitting in a corner booth

01:12:23.167 --> 01:12:27.627
with some Arab guy, but he
passed out. No sign of 'em now.

01:12:27.628 --> 01:12:30.588
One man, one man
caused all this.

01:12:30.589 --> 01:12:32.683
Let's try one
man and one woman.

01:12:32.684 --> 01:12:36.225
Guess we had it wrong all along.

01:12:36.846 --> 01:12:39.725
It was always both of them.

No loose ends.

01:13:24.685 --> 01:13:26.312
I'm sorry.

01:13:35.946 --> 01:13:37.914
(Detective) Hey, what do we got?
I just arrived here

01:13:37.915 --> 01:13:41.286
and checked in and that's
what's happening over there.

01:13:45.372 --> 01:13:48.708
It's above your
position, Detective.

01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:49.542
Excuse me?

01:13:49.543 --> 01:13:51.964
You should never have
been put into this position.

01:13:51.965 --> 01:13:55.173
Had I known, I would never have
allowed them to do this to you.

01:13:55.174 --> 01:13:57.494
Had you known what? All hell
would break loose and I would.

01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:02.972
Look, as you should
know by now,

01:14:02.973 --> 01:14:06.225
Conrad Miller is a double agent.

01:14:06.226 --> 01:14:12.199
Getting secrets and selling them
to the old Cold War buyers.

01:14:14.568 --> 01:14:18.243
And the woman,
Laura, what's her story?

01:14:18.364 --> 01:14:21.574
The real Laura
Wilder died 15 years ago.

01:14:21.575 --> 01:14:24.911
KGB agent Yulovsky
took over her identity.

01:14:24.912 --> 01:14:28.706
She is the asset that
Conrad took from my country

01:14:28.707 --> 01:14:29.924
that we've been looking for.

01:14:29.925 --> 01:14:34.253
And I am bringing her back
with me when I go back home.

01:14:34.254 --> 01:14:37.924
So this is some real
KGB shit, huh'? Spy versus spy?

this only happens in the movies.

So what's the end
game here, Cushko?

01:14:51.114 --> 01:14:53.107
End game?

01:14:53.691 --> 01:14:54.908
That's classified.

01:14:54.909 --> 01:14:59.112
Go home, take a hot shower,
go to bed, go to sleep.

01:14:59.113 --> 01:15:00.947
Tomorrow is another day.

01:15:00.948 --> 01:15:02.291
Is that how you
Russian boys do it?

01:15:02.292 --> 01:15:06.119
Say tomorrow will be a better
day and drink your vodka?

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.090
Lots and lots of vodka.

01:15:10.332 --> 01:15:13.418

been a pleasure, man.

Laura, did you know
she was pregnant?

01:15:32.021 --> 01:15:35.116
Let me ask you something, if it
was your family, and their lives

01:15:35.117 --> 01:15:39.738
were being threatened, wouldn't
you have done the same thing?

01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:51.085
