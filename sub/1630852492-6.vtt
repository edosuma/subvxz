- Okay.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.486
Um, because it's relatively
early in your pregnancy,

08:41.488 --> 08:43.421
We're gonna be doing
a transvaginal ultrasound,

08:43.490 --> 08:45.623

08:50.731 --> 08:52.230
- Fine.
- Good, good.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.699
But listen, if you are going
to throw up again,

08:54.834 --> 08:57.168

from me, that would be like,

08:57.204 --> 08:59.237

- No problem.

or are we waiting for anybody?

09:02.242 --> 09:03.575

- No way! I'm a donor baby.
- Really?

09:10.517 --> 09:12.617

about donor babies?

09:12.752 --> 09:14.386

Yeah.

Then I found out it was a book,

10:07.975 --> 10:09.774
I gotta read that book.
Turns out the book

10:09.776 --> 10:12.210

he'd be better off with her.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.971
- Okay, is this a fucking
joke?!

17:54.107 --> 17:55.773
- No, look, that was
my initial reaction too,

17:55.908 --> 17:57.942
But the more we talk,
the more I realize

17:58.011 --> 17:59.143
She might be right.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.011
I didn't want to burden you
with this

18:01.081 --> 18:02.846
'til I had figured
it out in my own head.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.782
- What exactly did you need
to figure out?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.651
There is a will that
very clearly states

18:06.786 --> 18:08.786
That marlene wants him
to stay with us.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.856
- Honey, she is his family.
- We are his family!

18:11.925 --> 18:15.259
- I know, and-and I thought our
shared dna would be enough,

18:17.630 --> 18:19.797
But, I-I'm having trouble
connecting with him.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.432
- Ohh! (chuckles)

18:21.434 --> 18:23.834
Are you? Are you having
trouble connecting?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.970
"he shoots, he scores?"
are you even trying?

18:26.039 --> 18:27.771
Why are you so weird
around him?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.206
- You don't understand.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.208
It's like having the ghost
of my ex in my own house.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.910
It's just a lot!

18:32.912 --> 18:34.679
- You're just as much a part
of him as she is,

18:34.814 --> 18:36.080
And you would know that--
- oh, bullshit.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.481
- If you actually made
an effort with him.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.383
Nathan, you're his father!

18:39.519 --> 18:41.552
The least you could do
is give him an opportunity

18:41.554 --> 18:43.287
To know you.
- I am trying.

18:43.422 --> 18:45.222
- Try harder!

18:45.258 --> 18:47.224

the ultrasound wrong.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.574
- Sloane mitchell?

19:03.709 --> 19:05.709
Did you forget something or--
(door shuts)

19:05.778 --> 19:08.913
- It was too fast. And it
couldn't have been right.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.718
- I'm sorry, I can get you a
different ultrasound technician

19:13.853 --> 19:15.953
If you'd like, though they've
probably all gone home by now.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.856
- Nope, I want you to do it.
- Okay.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.225
Well, you know the drill.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.062
So if you just wanna- oh!

19:25.098 --> 19:27.098
Your feet are already
in the stirrups.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.066
Okay, so I will just...

19:30.837 --> 19:32.836
Count you down from three.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.338
- No counting.

19:34.473 --> 19:36.506
- Okay.

your hips.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.256

19:54.661 --> 19:56.693
- Oh.
- Sorry.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.497
- It's okay.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.932
Just tell me where you want me
to go next.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.603
- Move that a little
to the left.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.774
Yeah.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.710
(gasps)

20:12.712 --> 20:14.612
