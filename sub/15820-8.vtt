00:11.784 --> 00:13.801
Somebody help me please.

00:16.038 --> 00:17.449
Please help me.

00:21.786 --> 00:25.878
Everybody clear, out of here,
right up please, the light's on.

00:32.509 --> 00:39.655
Yes this is Dr Eric Hall, I need an ambulance
right now at 507 Apria Avenue, and the police.

00:39.858 --> 00:40.864
Yes, right now.

00:40.966 --> 00:41.771
Thank you.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.873
Alright, what happened?

00:48.113 --> 00:51.837
A man with a bat, keeps beating Clint.

00:52.039 --> 00:56.329
I yelled at the man, he ran up
Saint George Street towards Marina

00:56.368 --> 00:59.338
Is there anything you
can do for him, please?

01:05.123 --> 01:10.055
Yeah, well, I called 20 minutes
ago, so could you please hurry up?

01:11.364 --> 01:13.059
Thank you.

01:18.904 --> 01:23.167
He was nowhere to be
found, but, we got the bat.

01:27.432 --> 01:29.191
I'm sorry.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:46.347 --> 01:50.198
As I claimed the victim dead, I
gave a sedative to his partner.

01:50.238 --> 01:52.892
Do you always carry these
kinds of drug with you, Dr Hall?

01:52.932 --> 01:55.785
Do you always carry
your gun, detective Ross?

01:55.825 --> 01:57.981
You should be asking how
come this guy with the bats

01:58.021 --> 02:00.775
may be allowed to go around
robbing people for the last month.

02:00.815 --> 02:02.870
Why didn't you catch him
before he kills someone, huh?

02:02.910 --> 02:05.365
Where were you one hour ago?
Where were the cops then huh?

02:05.405 --> 02:06.701
Eating the donuts?

02:06.902 --> 02:08.288
Johnson's on her way?

02:08.299 --> 02:11.665
This case is being handed
off to Priority Homicide.

02:11.691 --> 02:13.209
Hey, it's not my fault.

02:14.485 --> 02:15.591
Hear the kid?

02:16.880 --> 02:19.916
That's why you're getting
this case. Politics.

02:21.369 --> 02:25.060
Clear the room detective Ross. Now.

02:28.851 --> 02:31.095
Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

02:33.540 --> 02:35.850
–Can I help you?
–This cat is sick.

02:35.935 --> 02:37.392
You brought your cat to a crime scene?

02:37.432 --> 02:39.088
Look, he was crying and, and…

02:39.128 --> 02:44.077
he was licking all over my laundry basket and
he's not my cat really, he just lives at my house.

02:44.117 --> 02:45.173
Do you feed him?

02:45.215 --> 02:47.470
Look, sergeant, are you
gonna help me or not?

02:47.510 --> 02:50.502
Yeah, umm. Hey, huh, Terence.

02:51.401 --> 02:56.089
Deputy Chief Johnson here has a
sick cat. Can you help us with that?

02:57.550 --> 03:02.097
Certainly. Would you like me to get
him to an emergency animal hospital?

03:02.137 --> 03:03.394
Oh, that would be great.

03:03.434 --> 03:06.260
Thank you so much. Um…

03:06.326 --> 03:08.288
let me just give you my card…

03:08.355 --> 03:14.040
And you can call me if anything happens,
and he hates cars, so… be careful with him.

03:14.173 --> 03:17.098
I believe you can count on me not to…

03:17.165 --> 03:20.257
let the cat out of the bag.

03:24.281 --> 03:26.275
Let's go talk to the witness.

03:26.342 --> 03:27.306
Ok.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.234
Ahem. Here you are.

03:29.301 --> 03:31.263
Thank you. Sir?

03:31.329 --> 03:34.188
Can you tell me what happened?

03:34.255 --> 03:35.983
What's wrong with him?

03:36.050 --> 03:37.938
Some doctor gave him a tranquilizer.

03:37.978 --> 03:39.600
Is this the murder weapon?

03:39.640 --> 03:41.662
Why is this witness holding this bat?

03:41.702 --> 03:43.823
Well, it seems that while they
were waiting for us to get here,

03:43.863 --> 03:46.482
some of the gay boys put
together a little search party,

03:46.522 --> 03:47.646
and they picked it up.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.407
And they screwed up
the crime scene, too.

03:49.447 --> 03:50.872
They walked in some of the blood.

03:50.912 --> 03:52.899
They left cigarette butts
on the ground. It's a mess.

03:52.939 --> 03:54.961
People might wanna double
up on your protective gear

03:55.001 --> 03:57.029
since this is a homo-cide.

03:57.096 --> 03:58.884
You seem to be having trouble

03:58.924 --> 04:01.366
with your pronunciation this evening.

04:06.637 --> 04:07.968
Ahem!

04:09.729 --> 04:12.209
Oh… sorry.

04:22.852 --> 04:26.428
So, the first blow to the side of
the head is what killed your guy,

04:26.468 --> 04:28.287
and it was a pretty hard whack, too.

04:28.327 --> 04:30.843
Got an epidural bleed out from
it. The right pupil was blown.

04:30.883 --> 04:33.032
How do you know it was the first hit?

04:33.072 --> 04:35.090
It was the only blow delivered
to the back of the body.

04:35.130 --> 04:37.843
There was reside from the
pavement in it. He fell on it.

04:37.883 --> 04:40.306
Scan down slowly.

04:42.098 --> 04:45.017
Now, these other wounds
came afterwards…

04:45.084 --> 04:49.763
His cracked ribs, left
arm broken in 2 places,

04:49.828 --> 04:52.874
And a shattered femur… hum…
none of which was necessary,

04:52.914 --> 04:56.465
because your killer had him at “hello.”

04:57.395 --> 04:58.755
Sorry.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.170
I could have told you all
this at a regular autopsy.

05:01.210 --> 05:03.028
Oh, I know. But in hate crime

05:03.068 --> 05:05.351
I like to have documentary evidence
of what was done to the body

05:05.391 --> 05:06.883
before it's cut open

05:06.950 --> 05:09.067
so the defense attorneys
don't get a chance to argue

05:09.107 --> 05:10.892
that we broke the bones ourselves.

05:10.932 --> 05:14.609
If we're looking for evidence of
a hate crime, I'd say we found it.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.201
I understand some jewelry was stolen.

05:16.241 --> 05:18.026
A Gucci watch and a platinum ring.

05:18.066 --> 05:21.410
We found this under the t-shirt,
so it wasn't immediately visible.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.932
Maybe your thief has
night-vision issues.

05:23.972 --> 05:26.328
Maybe he was interrupted.

05:26.395 --> 05:28.750
Platinum dog tags with diamonds?

05:28.817 --> 05:31.670
And we found the
reside of some special K

05:31.736 --> 05:33.794
under your victim's nostrils.

05:33.861 --> 05:35.181
Special K? What's special K?

05:35.221 --> 05:36.242
It's slang for ketamine.

05:36.282 --> 05:38.300
It's popular in gay dance clubs.

05:38.340 --> 05:41.120
Means our victim might
not have suffered so much

05:41.160 --> 05:43.284
as he was battered to death.

05:46.751 --> 05:48.776
You got a tip on 4.

05:50.965 --> 05:53.984
Lieutenant Flynn. Yes, ma'am.

05:54.051 --> 05:56.440
Uh… oh, you did?

05:56.507 --> 06:00.588
Well, how closely would you
say he resembles the composite?

06:00.655 --> 06:03.142
He looks exactly like your boyfriend?

06:03.209 --> 06:05.227
Um… no, ma'am, he need not find out.

06:05.267 --> 06:07.051
If you could hold on a second,

06:07.091 --> 06:10.204
I'm gonna transfer you to someone
who can take his name and address.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.294
Where the hell is she? I'm waiting here,

06:12.334 --> 06:14.948
and I've got a very pissy
state legislator in there.

06:14.988 --> 06:17.271
She is having a personal crisis, sir.

06:17.311 --> 06:19.093
Yeah. It's called her life.

06:20.131 --> 06:21.226
Personal crisis.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.018
Sir.

06:26.337 --> 06:28.062
Yeah, Flynn here.

06:28.129 --> 06:30.637
Yeah. Put Taylor on the phone, pronto.

06:30.649 --> 06:34.566
I've got a tip for him
that's gonna make his day.

06:36.125 --> 06:38.143
Chief Pope, assemblyman Bridges,

06:38.183 --> 06:40.970
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

06:41.036 --> 06:42.197
For 20 minutes.

06:42.264 --> 06:43.956
A little emergency.

06:44.022 --> 06:46.643
Uh, this… this cat I know…

06:46.710 --> 06:48.402
Um, I have a cat.

06:48.468 --> 06:50.353
He's living at my house,
and he's very sick.

06:50.393 --> 06:51.920
Oh. What's his name?

06:52.782 --> 06:55.104
Kitty. I call him Kitty,

06:55.171 --> 06:57.288
and I forgot to ask
what vet he was going to.

06:57.328 --> 07:00.879
Anyway, um… it's a long story.

07:00.945 --> 07:06.054
I want you to know that we are
rushing that bat through S. I. D,

07:06.121 --> 07:07.840
looking for forensic evidence.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.339
Have a seat, please.

07:09.406 --> 07:12.452
But I want you to know that
there may be some question

07:12.492 --> 07:16.234
as to its admissibility, considering
it went through so many hands

07:16.274 --> 07:18.298
Before getting to us.

07:18.564 --> 07:21.013
What about the blood at the crime scene?

07:21.053 --> 07:23.268
Well, so far that only
belongs to the victim,

07:23.308 --> 07:25.399
so it doesn't do us any good,

07:25.465 --> 07:28.478
but I want you to know I'm
bringing in the other men

07:28.518 --> 07:31.763
who were attacked by this
guy along with the partner

07:31.803 --> 07:34.439
to refine this composite.

07:45.677 --> 07:47.723
It's upper level, apartment 21.

07:47.726 --> 07:50.762
Door was open. I put a
newspaper in the entry.

07:50.831 --> 07:53.312
Ok. Everybody remember, this
is an apartment building.

07:53.352 --> 07:56.117
Watch your background.
Let's go. Let's do this!

07:56.157 --> 07:58.354
Why wasn't this done before
refining the composite,

07:58.394 --> 08:01.232
sending it to television
stations and such?

08:06.287 --> 08:10.212
Whenever we disseminate
the likeness of a suspect,

08:10.273 --> 08:14.469
a defense attorney will accuse us
of contaminating the I. D process.

08:14.509 --> 08:17.126
We don't want to just
track the murderer down.

08:17.166 --> 08:21.192
We want to make sure we do it
so that he's put away for life.

08:26.489 --> 08:29.513
There does come a time, of course,
when the most important thing

08:29.553 --> 08:32.919
is to catch the guy
before he kills again.

08:32.986 --> 08:34.360
American postal delivery.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.211
Got a package for Blake Rawlings.

08:36.251 --> 08:37.765
Leave it at the door.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.751
Someone's gotta sign for it.

08:42.042 --> 08:44.616
What are you doing? What are you doing?

08:47.039 --> 08:49.283
How do you guarantee a conviction?

08:49.412 --> 08:52.514
By being extra careful
in how I make my arrest.

08:55.371 --> 08:57.693
Blake Rawlings, you stupid asshole.

08:57.761 --> 09:00.083
Once I have a criminal in custody…

09:00.151 --> 09:02.333
I do my very best to gain his trust.

09:02.373 --> 09:05.462
You're under arrest for
assault with a deadly weapon.

09:05.502 --> 09:08.230
Gentlemen, I think we got a match.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.839
You have the right to remain silent…

09:09.879 --> 09:11.589
When there's problems with evidence,

09:11.629 --> 09:13.885
my most important responsibility

09:13.952 --> 09:16.039
is inducing a criminal to talk.

09:16.410 --> 09:20.954
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

09:25.596 --> 09:26.858
We have no evidence

09:26.926 --> 09:28.811
from the apartment where
the arrest was made…

09:28.851 --> 09:32.762
No wallets, no jewelry, no bloody
clothes. Nothing. We got a composite.

09:32.802 --> 09:34.721
Taylor got positive
I. D's on Blake Rawlings

09:34.761 --> 09:36.679
from 2 of the people that he robbed.

09:36.719 --> 09:39.601
Yeah. After he roughed the guy up.
Brenda, we are in terrible shape here.

09:39.641 --> 09:41.958
Oh, boo-hoo! Don't come
crying on my shoulder.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.448
Robbery-Homicide
clearly wants this case,

09:44.488 --> 09:46.939
and after the mess they've made of
it, I'd just as soon they keep it.

09:46.979 --> 09:49.302
No, no, no. Taylor made the arrest.

09:49.368 --> 09:50.896
That's all.

09:50.962 --> 09:55.544
Look, Will, if you even try
to pass this guy off on me now

09:55.611 --> 09:58.759
after Taylor personally went
out and supervised his capture,

09:58.799 --> 10:02.053
you will make huge problems for me…

10:02.119 --> 10:03.115
Huge!

10:03.214 --> 10:04.336
Brenda, I'll handle all that.

10:04.376 --> 10:06.262
That's what you always say about Taylor,

10:06.302 --> 10:08.021
and then you never do anything about it!

10:08.061 --> 10:10.578
Would you stop acting like I'm
the sand shifting under your feet?

10:10.618 --> 10:13.009
Because I have… ahem.

10:13.076 --> 10:17.158
In every respect but one, I have always

10:17.224 --> 10:19.183
stuck with you.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.176
And I need this done.

10:21.242 --> 10:22.437
Now.

10:30.013 --> 10:32.399
I… I don't know. I can't say.

10:32.464 --> 10:35.551
Can you move in closer, please, Buzz.

10:38.044 --> 10:40.691
I'm sorry. He was
leaning over in the dark,

10:40.731 --> 10:44.018
and I turned away when
he threw the bat at me.

10:44.085 --> 10:46.442
I mean, he looks familiar,

10:46.507 --> 10:49.788
but it might just be from that picture
they had up in the bar, you know?

10:49.828 --> 10:53.447
Do you think that's the
guy that killed Clint?

10:53.513 --> 10:54.942
It may be.

10:55.008 --> 10:58.892
Can you tell me what
happened before the attack?

10:58.959 --> 11:01.840
We were stopping for a
drink before we went dancing.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.201
Mm-hmm. Just a drink?

11:03.241 --> 11:05.525
Ha. Not even… Not for me.
I was the designated driver.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.786
But, uh… Clint was a little high.

11:08.853 --> 11:10.879
And then we left,

11:10.945 --> 11:12.831
and we got about halfway to the car

11:12.871 --> 11:14.822
when I realized that I had
left my jacket in the bar,

11:14.862 --> 11:16.710
and my cell phone was in it,

11:16.722 --> 11:19.278
and so I had to go back for it.

11:19.344 --> 11:21.435
And Clint made a face

11:21.502 --> 11:24.623
because I always forget things.

11:24.689 --> 11:27.114
So you went back to get your coat…

11:27.181 --> 11:29.404
The bartender had kept it for me.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.518
He made a little joke when he gave
it back. I was gonna jot it down.

11:32.558 --> 11:37.273
I, uh, write sitcoms when I'm working.

11:39.166 --> 11:43.714
Haven't, uh… haven't been
doing much of that lately…

11:43.781 --> 11:45.274
Working.

11:48.261 --> 11:50.313
We just put our house on the market.

11:50.353 --> 11:53.059
Clint was trying to
get back into acting.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.559
So on your way back to the car…

11:57.626 --> 12:00.614
Yeah, sorry. Um…

12:00.680 --> 12:03.004
I saw someone.

12:03.071 --> 12:06.157
He was swinging a bat down on Clint,

12:06.224 --> 12:08.084
and I started screaming.

12:08.150 --> 12:11.397
The guy jerked up, and I must
have been running towards him,

12:11.437 --> 12:16.020
because he threw the
bat at me, and, uh…

12:18.143 --> 12:20.500
I just let the guy go on because…

12:22.758 --> 12:24.718
part of his head was gone.

12:25.083 --> 12:28.072
Clint's head was gone.

12:29.698 --> 12:31.245
I'm sorry.

12:40.661 --> 12:43.793
You know, I don't care about
the money or the credit cards.

12:43.833 --> 12:49.076
But… he took Clint's ring
from our commitment ceremony.

12:49.142 --> 12:53.483
And if this is the guy
and if you could find it,

12:53.550 --> 12:56.288
I'd like to have it back.

12:57.275 --> 12:59.573
Speaking of jewelry, um…

13:03.431 --> 13:05.225
Clint was wearing this…

13:06.409 --> 13:08.775
during the attack.

13:12.024 --> 13:13.817
You don't recognize it?

13:13.885 --> 13:18.108
Not only is that not his, we can't
afford anything like that right now.

13:18.148 --> 13:21.976
I'm worried about buying a
suit I can wear to his funeral.

13:24.051 --> 13:26.486
You know…

13:26.555 --> 13:29.762
Why would the guy leave something
like that if this was a robbery?

13:29.802 --> 13:33.930
I… I don't see how this makes sense.

13:34.065 --> 13:36.639
Blake Rawlings. Convicted of car theft.

13:36.670 --> 13:39.579
Served 3 years. Finished his parole.

13:39.647 --> 13:43.194
Did some time in juvie, but,
uh, we don't know what for.

13:43.234 --> 13:45.808
He's robbed over a dozen people so far,

13:45.838 --> 13:47.950
and there's no jewelry anywhere,

13:47.970 --> 13:50.872
no rings, wallets, credit
card, buttons, string?

13:50.912 --> 13:52.227
What's the problem, chief?

13:52.267 --> 13:53.917
The crime scene's contaminated,

13:53.957 --> 13:56.490
the bat's out of evidence, we
found nothing at the robberies,

13:56.530 --> 13:58.146
our witness can't identify the killer,

13:58.186 --> 14:00.100
and he threw away his weapon,

14:00.149 --> 14:02.037
which, according to all
records, he'd never done before.

14:02.077 --> 14:04.321
You hit a homer, you drop the bat.

14:04.378 --> 14:07.659
Flynn, could you please
get your ass off my desk?

14:15.406 --> 14:17.498
Unless you actually know
something about this guy,

14:17.538 --> 14:19.460
I don't need any more
pressure before I go in here.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.050
Ok, that's not why I'm here.

14:21.090 --> 14:25.515
I promised assemblyman Bridges we would
keep him informed, and… he may pop by.

14:25.555 --> 14:27.816
I just this second said I
didn't need any more pressure.

14:27.856 --> 14:29.704
Isn't that what I just said?

14:40.549 --> 14:43.483
Hello, Blake… Mr York.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.344
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson,

14:45.384 --> 14:46.677
and this is sergeant Gabriel.

14:46.717 --> 14:48.285
How you doing?

14:48.352 --> 14:51.079
Uh, Ms Johnson, I'm
afraid we're not in a, uh…

14:51.119 --> 14:52.079
talking mood today.

14:52.119 --> 14:53.414
Well, I'm sorry to hear

14:53.454 --> 14:54.680
y'all feel that way,

14:54.720 --> 14:56.248
because it'll be a long time

14:56.288 --> 14:58.248
before you find a more sympathetic ear.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.423
I know how you feel, Blake.

15:00.489 --> 15:02.284
You can't go anywhere
in L. A. without seeing

15:02.324 --> 15:05.552
a bunch of gay people running
around, doing whatever they want.

15:05.592 --> 15:08.486
It's not like that where
I come from. No, sir.

15:08.526 --> 15:11.093
But in California…

15:11.160 --> 15:14.294
They can even register
as domestic partners…

15:14.361 --> 15:16.222
have the same rights as married people.

15:16.262 --> 15:17.657
Serves them right, too.

15:17.697 --> 15:18.923
Why shouldn't they suffer

15:18.963 --> 15:20.224
just like everybody else?

15:20.264 --> 15:21.857
Mm-hmm. But they're not married people,

15:21.897 --> 15:22.998
are they?

15:24.532 --> 15:25.899
Mr Pope, good work.

15:26.732 --> 15:27.932
What's going on?

15:28.967 --> 15:31.027
Can we hear anything from out here?

15:31.067 --> 15:33.001
Uh… no. No, I… I can't seem

15:33.068 --> 15:34.129
to get that speaker to work.

15:34.169 --> 15:36.462
You're kidding. It was
working fine earlier.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.297
and you're good-looking, too.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.198
There you go. A real handsome young man.

15:40.238 --> 15:41.690
Thank you, lieutenant.

15:43.405 --> 15:44.933
You were in juvenile detention

15:44.973 --> 15:46.533
when you were a teenager.
That must've been rough

15:46.573 --> 15:48.374
on a cute boy like you.

15:48.441 --> 15:49.800
Guys make you do things for them?

15:49.840 --> 15:51.168
Don't answer that, Blake.

15:51.208 --> 15:53.269
Ms Johnson, that is a
horrible question. Horrible.

15:53.309 --> 15:55.002
because you're still so boyish…

15:55.042 --> 15:56.404
What the hell is she saying?

15:56.444 --> 15:57.836
She's trying to scare him.

15:57.876 --> 15:59.971
Listen. Listen to what the criminal

16:00.011 --> 16:02.972
–has to say, not Brenda…
–linking my client to this murder, do you?

16:03.012 --> 16:04.839
I have the victims of his A. DW. S,

16:04.879 --> 16:07.041
2 of which have already
given me a positive I. D

16:07.081 --> 16:09.308
and if those charges are separated,

16:09.348 --> 16:11.724
that bat gives him his third strike.

16:11.748 --> 16:12.909
Blake spends the rest of his life

16:12.949 --> 16:14.410
being the cute boy in prison.

16:14.450 --> 16:16.444
And if it were a hate crime, too…

16:16.484 --> 16:20.312
Prove to me that you didn't kill that boy
last night because you hate gay people.

16:20.352 --> 16:22.919
I don't hate anyone. All right?

16:22.986 --> 16:25.113
None of this has got
anything to do with hate.

16:25.153 --> 16:27.321
Hey, Blake… you cannot talk.

16:27.388 --> 16:28.388
We're done.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.416
–We're leaving.
–You just shut… shut…

16:30.456 --> 16:32.350
You tell him to shut up. All right?

16:32.390 --> 16:34.050
Hey. You… hey. You
gonna shut up or what⁈

16:34.090 --> 16:36.618
Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy, why don't you
go stand over there. All right?

16:36.658 --> 16:38.419
Your client seems to
be refusing counsel.

16:38.459 --> 16:41.825
Is that what you're doing,
Blake… refusing counsel?

16:42.394 --> 16:44.654
Can I… can I get a
cigarette out of that at least?

16:44.694 --> 16:46.155
I'm… I'm hurting here. You know?

16:46.195 --> 16:47.589
You get a cigarette after you help me.

16:47.629 --> 16:49.256
Hey, look I have to
formally object to you…

16:49.296 --> 16:51.397
Just shut it!

16:51.464 --> 16:52.397
Shut it!

16:52.464 --> 16:53.425
Hey, Blake. Blake.

16:53.465 --> 16:54.458
Take a seat. All right?

16:54.498 --> 16:56.165
We're good. We're good.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.726
Just… we're gonna
set you up. Don't worry.

16:58.766 --> 16:59.700
Just sit down.

17:00.766 --> 17:02.134
Down. Just chill.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.303
Uh… you'll… you'll help me?

17:09.369 --> 17:10.770
You know what I mean?

17:12.104 --> 17:13.204
All right.

17:14.838 --> 17:19.166
Look, I like to go after gay guys because late
at night when they're walking back to their cars,

17:19.207 --> 17:22.034
they're drunk and stuff,
and they're usually alone,

17:22.074 --> 17:23.476
and they got money.

17:24.342 --> 17:26.443
See? What'd I tell you?

17:26.510 --> 17:28.377
That's it, isn't it?

17:28.443 --> 17:31.011
like half of the town. You know?

17:31.077 --> 17:33.445
Will you be able to prove

17:33.512 --> 17:35.473
that it's a hate crime, though?

17:35.513 --> 17:36.680
Is that enough?

17:36.747 --> 17:38.341
I think the body does that for us.

17:38.381 --> 17:42.011
Stay with me. Where were
you last night at 12:30 a. m.?

17:42.583 --> 17:44.109
I went to the grocery store.

17:44.149 --> 17:46.950
My girlfriend, she
don't like it that I…

17:47.017 --> 17:48.685
I use a little, so, uh…

17:48.752 --> 17:50.979
You know, I did a needle
in the parking lot.

17:51.019 --> 17:53.986
Where is it? The stuff you stole?

17:54.053 --> 17:57.381
Everything's still in the
back of my girlfriend's car.

17:57.421 --> 17:59.788
Can you help me now?

18:01.389 --> 18:02.989
Please. Can you…

18:03.056 --> 18:04.523
Can you help me?

18:21.287 --> 18:23.240
Lieutenant Andrew Flynn, L. A. P. D

18:23.280 --> 18:25.722
I have a warrant to search your home.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.787
Flynn. You're the guy I talked to
on the phone about my boyfriend.

18:28.827 --> 18:29.988
Excuse me?

18:30.055 --> 18:31.776
I'm Jennifer? You
transferred me to the guy

18:31.816 --> 18:34.433
who's getting me the reward
money for turning Blake in?

18:34.473 --> 18:37.928
Captain Taylor, right? So,
did you bring the money?

18:37.992 --> 18:40.544
Look, you don't get the money
until he's convicted, honey.

18:40.584 --> 18:42.537
Now, he said he stashed
some stuff at your place.

18:42.577 --> 18:44.503
You mind if we look around?

18:53.204 --> 18:54.267
Watch your step.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.459
Is Blake coming back?

18:56.526 --> 19:00.090
I don't think you have to
worry about him for a while.

19:01.375 --> 19:02.298
You got the keys to this?

19:02.338 --> 19:03.593
Oh, no, you're not taking my car,

19:03.633 --> 19:05.321
are you? I mean, how am
I supposed to get around?

19:05.361 --> 19:07.413
This is how you pay people
back for being good citizens?

19:07.453 --> 19:08.582
I need a, uh…

19:08.649 --> 19:09.876
Yes, sir. Thanks.

19:09.943 --> 19:12.517
What are you doing? What are you doing?

19:12.568 --> 19:14.284
You want to relax, please?

19:19.476 --> 19:20.672
Bingo.

19:20.738 --> 19:22.332
Lots of loot.

19:23.595 --> 19:24.822
Needles. Yeah.

19:26.285 --> 19:28.543
So. What's this?

19:32.760 --> 19:33.923
Here's the bat.

19:34.886 --> 19:35.816
Yeah, but…

19:35.882 --> 19:38.336
we already have a bat.

19:44.115 --> 19:45.538
Flynn works for Taylor,

19:45.578 --> 19:48.463
So I'm not surprised he transferred
the call to Robbery-Homicide.

19:48.503 --> 19:53.585
In fact, I'm more surprised that he
told me about it more than anything else.

19:53.756 --> 19:54.686
Why is that?

19:54.753 --> 19:58.237
Well, you're caught in the middle
a lot, aren't you, sergeant Gabriel?

19:58.277 --> 20:01.694
Must be hard to know which side to
come down on sometimes, I'm sure.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.704
Not if I keep focused
on getting the bad guy.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.252
I mean, truth is you do good work.

20:07.319 --> 20:09.041
You're the one who got the guy to talk,

20:09.081 --> 20:10.836
give up his stash, this proof.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.363
That Blake robs people,
not that he kills them,

20:13.403 --> 20:14.991
that he has a wooden
bat, not an aluminum one,

20:15.031 --> 20:16.886
that he steals jewelry,
not that he gets rid of it,

20:16.926 --> 20:20.244
and where is the victim's Gucci
watch and his platinum ring?

20:20.284 --> 20:22.738
If he got scared and
threw away his weapon,

20:22.778 --> 20:25.363
maybe he dumped the
stuff he'd stolen, too.

20:25.403 --> 20:28.096
That's exactly what happened, sergeant.

20:28.163 --> 20:31.221
Get detective Sanchez and some uniforms.

20:31.288 --> 20:32.378
Go back to the crime scene

20:32.418 --> 20:34.771
and see if you can find
the watch or the ring.

20:34.811 --> 20:35.835
Deputy Chief Johnson?

20:35.875 --> 20:37.438
Yes? Oh.

20:37.505 --> 20:38.462
Terence. Terence.

20:38.502 --> 20:39.599
Hey.

20:40.696 --> 20:42.026
Hi.

20:43.655 --> 20:44.744
I meant to call you.

20:44.784 --> 20:46.414
Um, how's the Kitty?

20:46.481 --> 20:48.269
Well, making feline history.

20:48.309 --> 20:50.403
He was very sick, huh?

20:50.470 --> 20:52.895
No. He was very pregnant.

20:52.962 --> 20:54.824
He had 6 kittens.

20:54.890 --> 20:57.284
And here's your bill.

20:58.746 --> 21:01.007
$286?

21:01.672 --> 21:03.501
You know, uh…

21:03.567 --> 21:05.854
I… I happen to be free this evening.

21:05.894 --> 21:08.336
If you like, I could pick up your cat

21:08.478 --> 21:09.888
and deliver it…

21:10.076 --> 21:12.083
him… her…

21:12.144 --> 21:13.241
to your house.

21:14.059 --> 21:16.292
Bottle of chilled champagne.

21:16.937 --> 21:18.784
Toast fertility…

21:18.969 --> 21:20.480
Motherhood…

21:20.789 --> 21:22.496
Mistaken identity.

21:28.001 --> 21:29.981
Deputy Chief Johnson's office.

21:30.579 --> 21:32.183
Yes, sir. She is.

21:33.325 --> 21:34.147
Chief Pope.

21:34.182 --> 21:35.185
Oh, great.

21:35.785 --> 21:37.466
It's my boss. Excuse me.

21:38.768 --> 21:40.128
Hello.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.757
Thanks.

21:44.883 --> 21:46.496
Uh, no, no, no. That's fine.

21:46.536 --> 21:47.922
I'll come right down.

21:47.948 --> 21:49.291
Bye.

21:50.136 --> 21:51.852
I have to go meet my boss.

21:53.405 --> 21:55.509
Thank you so much for
your help, Terence.

21:55.549 --> 21:57.343
I'll pick up Kitty.

22:01.192 --> 22:03.502
Sergeant Gabriel will show you out.

22:03.816 --> 22:04.871
Thank you.

22:04.878 --> 22:06.144
Uh, well, um…

22:06.179 --> 22:07.704
perhaps another time.

22:20.734 --> 22:22.601
So, do you want us to go ahead

22:22.641 --> 22:23.805
and charge Blake for murder?

22:23.845 --> 22:25.860
No. We don't have that confession yet.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.386
Pope wants to congratulate me.

22:27.426 --> 22:28.307
Damn it.

22:28.365 --> 22:30.030
I gotta have drinks.

22:31.579 --> 22:32.631
You're kidding me.

22:32.671 --> 22:34.952
You're blowing me off to meet with Pope.

22:34.992 --> 22:37.547
I'm just gonna run in, have a quick
drink, and run back out of there.

22:37.587 --> 22:38.644
A drink?

22:38.712 --> 22:40.521
It'll take me 5 minutes.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.196
I got offered dodger tickets,

22:45.265 --> 22:46.528
but I said no

22:46.596 --> 22:48.058
cause I thought we
were gonna have dinner.

22:48.098 --> 22:49.258
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.703
It's been a crazy day at work today.

22:51.715 --> 22:53.035
The cat had kittens,

22:53.046 --> 22:55.026
and I've gotta go pick him up,

22:55.059 --> 22:56.625
because every moment he's at the vet,

22:56.665 --> 22:58.228
it's costing me a billion dollars.

22:58.268 --> 23:00.931
Your boy cat had kittens?

23:00.998 --> 23:02.392
I thought it was a boy.

23:02.432 --> 23:03.962
I don't even know
when I can pick him up.

23:04.002 --> 23:05.129
Turn up here.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.445
All right, all right.
Here's what we're gonna do.

23:10.485 --> 23:12.986
I will pick up your cat for
you while you're in with Pope.

23:13.026 --> 23:14.036
Oh, really?

23:14.101 --> 23:15.959
Oh, Fritzy, thank you.

23:16.024 --> 23:19.054
Ok. Let me just get you the vet's card.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.904
I'm actually kind of worried about him.

23:20.944 --> 23:22.339
Her. You're worried about her.

23:22.379 --> 23:24.659
So I'll pick up Kitty.

23:24.723 --> 23:26.671
Then we'll go get something to eat, ok?

23:26.711 --> 23:28.439
Ok. Ok.

23:30.134 --> 23:32.120
You sure about this?

23:32.186 --> 23:34.133
Could you still go to the ball game?

23:34.173 --> 23:36.246
No.

23:39.606 --> 23:41.547
Caught the murderer. He confessed.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.681
The gay community is…

23:42.721 --> 23:45.143
gay again. What could be better?

23:51.369 --> 23:56.533
On a, uh… a more personal note, uh…

23:56.599 --> 23:58.858
I know the L. A. P. D as an institution

23:58.898 --> 24:03.528
has not been as
supportive as you expected,

24:03.595 --> 24:07.227
and, uh, so in consideration of that…

24:09.391 --> 24:10.523
Oh. Will,

24:10.591 --> 24:12.488
this is too much.

24:12.556 --> 24:13.721
It… no, it isn't.

24:13.788 --> 24:15.554
Honest. It…

24:15.620 --> 24:16.872
Here. Let me… let me show you.

24:16.912 --> 24:18.712
It's just…

24:18.784 --> 24:19.803
2 little earrings.

24:19.843 --> 24:21.064
See? Tiny.

24:22.359 --> 24:23.943
You can hardly see them.

24:23.971 --> 24:26.074
It's not that big a deal.

24:27.430 --> 24:30.315
Does Estelle know
you're giving me these?

24:31.333 --> 24:32.995
Well, no.

24:33.063 --> 24:37.270
Because she would read all kinds
of ridiculous things into it,

24:37.337 --> 24:39.164
and the last thing I need right now

24:39.204 --> 24:41.844
is another lesson in community property.

24:42.902 --> 24:46.431
It just happens, in the
funny way that life works,

24:46.497 --> 24:50.699
that you would become one of the few
people in the world that I really…

24:50.739 --> 24:53.317
trust and really…

24:53.385 --> 24:56.132
Brenda? You've gone off somewhere.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.576
Oh. I'm sorry.

24:58.643 --> 25:01.765
Uh, I-I'm just worried
about the jewelry.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.760
Look, if you feel that
strongly about it…

25:03.800 --> 25:05.457
Oh, no, no. No. Not this jewelry.

25:05.497 --> 25:07.831
The jewelry that was
found on the victim's body.

25:07.871 --> 25:09.466
Oh. That jewelry.

25:09.533 --> 25:11.843
It's the DA. 's murder now, Brenda.

25:15.245 --> 25:16.686
Did you have other plans?

25:16.726 --> 25:18.982
No. No.

25:20.111 --> 25:22.474
Oh. Well, uh, yes.

25:22.543 --> 25:25.048
You see, the thing is that I…

25:25.119 --> 25:27.477
I haven't charged Blake
for the murder yet.

25:27.517 --> 25:28.432
Why?

25:28.503 --> 25:30.690
Well, there's an evidence issue

25:30.760 --> 25:32.278
and, uh, no confession.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.283
But don't worry about
it. I'll work it out.

25:34.323 --> 25:35.150
Don't worry about what?

25:35.190 --> 25:36.444
The case is solved.

25:36.519 --> 25:38.197
But not closed.

25:38.478 --> 25:40.189
We'll talk about it in the morning.

25:40.229 --> 25:43.187
And thank you so much for the earrings.

25:43.187 --> 25:45.069
They're beautiful.

25:46.149 --> 25:47.367
Bye-Bye now.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.982
Bye.

26:08.895 --> 26:12.886
Oh! Look, they're so small.

26:17.305 --> 26:18.895
Where's his pillowcase?

26:18.962 --> 26:20.452
He had a pillowcase.

26:20.518 --> 26:22.240
You're welcome, Brenda.

26:22.306 --> 26:24.095
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.252
Thank you.

26:29.845 --> 26:32.457
It's just that it was part of a set,

26:32.514 --> 26:34.103
and I have to travel with him,

26:34.143 --> 26:35.704
and he just hates the car so much.

26:35.744 --> 26:39.024
She. She. She. She hates the car.

26:39.724 --> 26:43.829
What is the blue box?
Did Pope give you that?

26:43.895 --> 26:45.941
He feels bad about the
way I've been treated here,

26:45.981 --> 26:47.365
so he got me a pair of earrings.

26:47.405 --> 26:49.485
That's all. Oh. Oh, it's nothing.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.841
I bet those are the cheapest
thing Tiffany's sells.

26:50.881 --> 26:52.531
Oh, it doesn't matter what they cost.

26:52.571 --> 26:54.319
Jewelry is never just jewelry.

26:54.359 --> 26:56.943
And where Pope is concerned, come on.

27:00.981 --> 27:04.285
How am I gonna valet this
car with 6 kittens in it?

27:04.325 --> 27:06.877
Just seems impossible, doesn't it?

27:14.023 --> 27:17.352
How did I become one of these
women with too many cats?

27:17.392 --> 27:18.792
How did this happen?

27:18.859 --> 27:23.083
Ahem. Here's something that might
make you feel a little better.

27:23.264 --> 27:25.098
Voila.

27:26.466 --> 27:29.394
There's a park across the
street from the crime scene

27:29.434 --> 27:30.928
with a, uh, little lake in the center.

27:30.968 --> 27:34.264
That's why we didn't find the
jewelry in the trunk of the Camaro,

27:34.304 --> 27:37.340
cause he emptied the
wallet, dumped the rest.

27:37.407 --> 27:40.908
Sorry to interrupt you
gentlemen on your night off,

27:40.975 --> 27:42.303
but time is not on my side,

27:42.343 --> 27:45.272
and there's someone critically involved
in this murder who I have yet to meet.

27:45.312 --> 27:47.947
So, uh, lieutenant Tao,

27:48.014 --> 27:50.509
can you have the diamonds
removed from this necklace,

27:50.549 --> 27:51.577
please, and have them I. D'd.

27:51.617 --> 27:53.111
I need to find out
where they were bought.

27:53.151 --> 27:54.878
Sure. There's a local office

27:54.918 --> 27:56.847
of the international gemological
institute here in L. A.

27:56.887 --> 27:59.415
Not only will you find out
what store this was sold…

27:59.455 --> 28:01.584
Thank you so much,
lieutenant. That's great.

28:01.624 --> 28:02.858
That's great.

28:02.924 --> 28:05.387
Detective Sanchez, if
you could get me a dump

28:05.427 --> 28:06.887
off every phone that
the victim was using.

28:06.927 --> 28:10.790
Let's see if there was someone other than
his partner that he was talking to a lot.

28:10.830 --> 28:12.225
And, sergeant Gabriel,

28:12.265 --> 28:14.500
if you could get a credit report

28:14.566 --> 28:16.327
on any frequent callers
as well as Clint and Barry.

28:16.367 --> 28:18.263
I'm pretty sure they
didn't buy this necklace,

28:18.303 --> 28:22.566
but there's another person involved in
this murder, and I'm pretty sure they did.

28:22.606 --> 28:24.073
–Hey, chief.
–Yeah?

28:24.140 --> 28:25.341
What about me?

28:25.408 --> 28:26.442
You. Uh…

28:26.509 --> 28:27.842
Lieutenant, you.

28:27.909 --> 28:29.638
Um, you can man the tip line.

28:29.678 --> 28:32.179
Uh, but we already caught the guy.

28:32.246 --> 28:34.474
I know, but you never
know who might phone in.

28:34.514 --> 28:36.709
And who would transfer
those calls to captain Taylor

28:36.749 --> 28:38.462
if you weren't here?

28:49.638 --> 28:51.060
Damn.

28:54.349 --> 28:55.491
Taylor.

28:55.547 --> 28:57.040
What you doing with our suspect?

28:57.080 --> 28:58.601
You know how it is, Provenza.

28:58.641 --> 29:01.413
The Pope giveth, and
the Pope taketh away.

29:10.784 --> 29:12.460
Can you help me?

29:12.527 --> 29:13.913
You know what I mean?

29:13.935 --> 29:15.947
You rang?

29:17.490 --> 29:19.764
Actually, I think I've got this covered.

29:19.804 --> 29:21.010
Go on back home.

29:21.077 --> 29:23.894
No sense in all of us being exhausted.

29:23.961 --> 29:27.476
Tao said you thought there might be
someone else involved in this murder.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.730
There's a strong possibility.

29:29.797 --> 29:34.423
almost. Where were you
last night at 12:30 a. m.?

29:34.491 --> 29:36.536
Ran out to the grocery store.

29:36.603 --> 29:39.179
My girlfriend don't like
it that I use a little,

29:39.219 --> 29:44.047
so, I, uh, you know… I did
a needle in the parking lot.

29:47.839 --> 29:50.757
Anything else you wanted
to tell me, lieutenant?

29:50.797 --> 29:52.521
No.

29:54.992 --> 29:56.656
See ya later.

29:58.567 --> 29:59.902
Deputy Chief Johnson called me.

29:59.942 --> 30:01.881
Ok, she told me they found a wooden bat

30:01.921 --> 30:03.154
in the back of my client's car,

30:03.194 --> 30:04.395
and that's not the murder weapon.

30:04.435 --> 30:06.574
I don't care if he uses
one bat to rob people

30:06.614 --> 30:09.159
and another bat to kill them.

30:10.815 --> 30:13.721
We're gonna settle this right now.

30:16.829 --> 30:20.579
You admitted to those other
assaults, didn't you, son?

30:20.646 --> 30:23.105
I already said I
knocked around some fags.

30:23.145 --> 30:25.436
I'm sick, all right? I need a doctor.

30:25.476 --> 30:28.138
This is never gonna hold up,
ok, what you're doing here.

30:28.178 --> 30:30.571
We'll see who a judge
believes, us or a junkie.

30:30.611 --> 30:32.023
Your client doesn't have to talk to me

30:32.063 --> 30:35.099
if he doesn't want to.
You need a doctor, son?

30:35.779 --> 30:38.515
Want a transfer to the infirmary, too?

30:38.750 --> 30:42.446
You know we can help you out
with this drug down, right?

30:43.204 --> 30:45.131
You know what I mean, don't you, son?

30:45.171 --> 30:46.514
Don't you?

30:46.764 --> 30:49.168
There was a guy who you beat up

30:49.947 --> 30:51.364
who died.

30:51.524 --> 30:55.621
Now, I know you didn't
mean for that to happen,

30:55.831 --> 30:57.503
but he did.

30:57.563 --> 30:59.596
And we gotta get that settled.

30:59.664 --> 31:03.221
And then detective Ross,

31:03.290 --> 31:05.468
he's gonna get you to a hospital,

31:05.490 --> 31:08.270
and they're gonna
make you feel all good.

31:08.337 --> 31:09.314
This is torture, ok⁈

31:09.354 --> 31:10.601
You are torturing my client!

31:10.641 --> 31:13.824
Or you can go back to
your cell and wait it out.

31:15.249 --> 31:16.840
Now what's it gonna be?

31:16.909 --> 31:19.219
Blake, Blake, you don't answer him.

31:24.471 --> 31:25.600
I did it.

31:26.830 --> 31:30.011
You did what?

31:30.080 --> 31:33.330
What did you do?

31:33.397 --> 31:35.176
Come on. I need to hear it

31:35.244 --> 31:37.950
Before you can go to
the infirmary. What?

31:38.016 --> 31:39.451
What did you do?

31:39.520 --> 31:40.820
I killed the guy.

31:40.889 --> 31:43.933
I bashed him over the
head, and I killed him.

31:44.001 --> 31:45.082
I killed him.

31:45.082 --> 31:47.048
I killed him!

31:47.352 --> 31:49.918
I beat him to death.

31:50.995 --> 31:53.701
Now can you… can you
do something for me?

31:53.754 --> 31:55.494
Yeah, I can do something for you.

31:55.534 --> 31:57.341
Blake Rawlings,

31:57.409 --> 31:59.974
I can give you an upgrade

32:00.042 --> 32:03.052
from assault with a
deadly weapon to murder.

32:04.499 --> 32:07.020
That's what I'm gonna give you.

32:07.533 --> 32:10.305
Detective Ross, put
that back in its cage.

32:18.912 --> 32:19.879
And so…

32:19.946 --> 32:21.911
Please, sit.

32:21.978 --> 32:23.645
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

32:23.712 --> 32:25.404
The necklace came from
Marseilles Mewelers,

32:25.444 --> 32:29.437
and so we took all the names we got
from dumping the victim's phones.

32:29.477 --> 32:30.803
One guy stood out immediately.

32:30.843 --> 32:31.776
Lots of calls,

32:31.843 --> 32:34.007
sometimes 60 minutes at a time.

32:34.074 --> 32:36.401
Julian Carver, and
here's his credit report.

32:36.441 --> 32:39.100
And a charge to his American
Express card at Marseilles Jewelers.

32:39.140 --> 32:41.806
Which also has an on-line catalog,

32:41.872 --> 32:43.232
and the price for the dog tags

32:43.272 --> 32:45.332
just happens to match
what Mr Carver spent.

32:45.372 --> 32:48.637
Barry and Clint's credit reports.

32:48.704 --> 32:49.930
He was telling the truth.

32:49.970 --> 32:52.363
They hadn't made a lot of
money in the last few years.

32:52.403 --> 32:54.895
And if Clint bought something,
he would have known about it,

32:54.935 --> 32:56.429
because these are all joint accounts.

32:56.469 --> 32:58.067
Checking and credit.

32:58.134 --> 32:59.561
They may not have been legally married,

32:59.601 --> 33:01.560
but they were financially. This is sad.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.225
Barry spent the last of his
available credit yesterday.

33:04.265 --> 33:05.659
Bought a suit for Clint's funeral.

33:05.699 --> 33:07.425
But what about this Julian Carver?

33:07.465 --> 33:09.625
We did a search on the
internet. He's a photographer,

33:09.665 --> 33:12.597
does magazine covers, exhibits.

33:12.664 --> 33:14.162
Headshots for actors?

33:14.229 --> 33:17.055
Barry said that Clint was trying
to start back up an acting career.

33:17.095 --> 33:19.894
So is every other waiter in L. A.

33:19.961 --> 33:21.987
Anyway, you're wasting your time.

33:22.027 --> 33:23.660
Oh, really, lieutenant?

33:23.727 --> 33:25.026
Why is that?

33:25.093 --> 33:26.286
Cause Taylor already got

33:26.326 --> 33:28.636
A confession out of Blake Rawlings.

33:29.433 --> 33:30.298
Ah, well.

33:30.333 --> 33:33.435
I don't think that
confession is gonna hold up.

33:38.589 --> 33:40.648
I went to 4 grocery stores
looking for these tapes.

33:40.688 --> 33:41.854
"I"?

33:41.921 --> 33:44.953
We. We. Are you happy?

33:45.020 --> 33:47.186
What do I know about videos?

33:47.252 --> 33:49.212
Come on, Buzz, damn it,
what's taking so long?

33:49.252 --> 33:52.684
Look, you think you can do
this faster, be my guest.

33:53.417 --> 33:55.144
All right, finally. Finally. Ok.

33:55.184 --> 33:56.909
Well, fast-forward it, would you?

33:56.949 --> 33:59.127
Do I have to tell you everything?

33:59.350 --> 34:01.142
Hey. Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

34:01.182 --> 34:04.748
See? There's that camaro parking.

34:04.815 --> 34:06.214
So we fast-forward.

34:06.281 --> 34:08.973
Now he gets out of the car, and
he goes into the grocery store.

34:09.013 --> 34:10.505
We've got that on film, too.

34:10.545 --> 34:13.043
Ok, come on. Fast-forward.

34:14.043 --> 34:15.244
Blake's back,

34:15.311 --> 34:18.811
and the time stamp covers the murder.

34:18.876 --> 34:20.775
Mmm. So he didn't do it.

34:20.842 --> 34:21.743
No.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.708
He couldn't have.

34:23.775 --> 34:27.274
I want to meet this Julian Carver.

34:28.907 --> 34:31.667
You don't mind if we look
around, do you, Mr Carver?

34:31.706 --> 34:33.165
You've got nothing to hide, right?

34:33.205 --> 34:37.670
No. No, but maybe if you told
me what you were looking for,

34:37.737 --> 34:39.364
specifically, I could help.

34:39.404 --> 34:41.563
Ah, that's all right. We'll be fine.

34:41.603 --> 34:43.935
So, how well do you know Clint?

34:44.868 --> 34:45.803
Not very.

34:45.868 --> 34:48.467
I did a few rolls on him…

34:48.534 --> 34:49.494
about 6 weeks ago.

34:49.534 --> 34:51.393
Uh, he was hunting for an agent.

34:51.434 --> 34:52.627
He needed new pictures.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.493
Mm. According to his cell phone records,

34:54.533 --> 34:56.358
you talked to him quite a bit,

34:56.398 --> 34:58.298
had some nice, long chats.

34:58.365 --> 34:59.731
Yeah, yeah.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.789
Uh, well, choosing a
picture that'll get you work,

35:02.829 --> 35:04.809
it's time-consuming, you know.

35:05.396 --> 35:07.429
What have we here?

35:10.761 --> 35:12.939
I think this may be a little, uh…

35:13.959 --> 35:14.926
special K.

35:14.993 --> 35:16.019
All right, all right.

35:16.059 --> 35:17.185
The reason I have that is…

35:17.225 --> 35:19.917
I just don't know what
to believe, Mr Carver.

35:19.957 --> 35:21.525
Start again.

35:21.591 --> 35:23.850
Tell me how well you know Clint Harper.

35:23.890 --> 35:25.822
Whoa. Chief.

35:27.189 --> 35:29.315
Think you might want to
come take a look at this.

35:29.355 --> 35:31.415
Ok, look. You have the wrong idea here.

35:31.455 --> 35:33.501
It's completely the wrong idea.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.352
All right, listen.

35:40.419 --> 35:42.069
We were having an affair.

35:42.118 --> 35:43.768
Actually, he pretty much…

35:43.785 --> 35:46.377
he'd pretty much decided
to leave Barry for me.

35:46.417 --> 35:47.377
He was moving in.

35:47.417 --> 35:49.215
You have any proof of that?

35:49.282 --> 35:51.082
Any shoes, socks?

35:53.281 --> 35:56.407
Looks like he was in
desperate need of underwear.

35:56.447 --> 36:00.979
Ok, uh, I want you to gather up
everything that belongs to Clint

36:01.046 --> 36:02.106
and bring it downtown,

36:02.146 --> 36:03.505
and I want these pictures, too.

36:03.545 --> 36:04.672
You're taking my artwork?

36:04.712 --> 36:06.638
This is for a gallery installation.

36:06.678 --> 36:08.170
Oh, I'm not going to mutilate them.

36:08.210 --> 36:10.236
I'm going to have them properly mounted.

36:10.276 --> 36:11.276
No.

36:11.343 --> 36:13.736
Look, you either let
me take these pictures,

36:13.776 --> 36:18.924
or I'm gonna arrest you for possession
of a controlled substance. Your choice.

36:23.173 --> 36:24.559
Buzz, move in closer.

36:24.801 --> 36:26.040
Yes, ma'am.

36:33.939 --> 36:35.402
I've never seen him before. No.

36:35.442 --> 36:40.258
He sometimes looks a
little better than this.

36:40.346 --> 36:42.188
Let's try a picture.

36:42.713 --> 36:45.455
It's slightly touched
up, but you get the idea.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.673
You sure you don't recognize him?

36:49.687 --> 36:50.897
No. No.

36:52.306 --> 36:53.322
No, I don't.

36:53.386 --> 36:55.286
Well, I am so surprised.

36:55.351 --> 36:58.662
Because Clint seems to
have known him pretty well.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.911
By the way, here are the clothes

37:01.911 --> 37:04.485
that Clint wasn't wearing in this shot.

37:04.536 --> 37:06.264
They were left at this guy's house,

37:06.304 --> 37:09.236
but according to the laws
governing community property

37:09.276 --> 37:11.686
in the state of California that
went into effect last january,

37:11.726 --> 37:13.423
these clothes now belong to you.

37:13.463 --> 37:17.203
As does the house that you're
selling to pay off your debts.

37:17.243 --> 37:17.989
You…

37:18.011 --> 37:21.142
Of course, if Clint had
dissolved your partnership,

37:21.182 --> 37:24.360
you would've had to split
everything with him 50-50.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.125
That hardly seems fair.

37:26.474 --> 37:28.604
You supported him, hadn't
you, for the last 6 years,

37:28.644 --> 37:30.271
and then you fell on some hard times,

37:30.311 --> 37:32.272
and he went out looking
for another boyfriend.

37:32.312 --> 37:34.146
No. No, no. It wasn't like…

37:34.321 --> 37:35.775
He wasn't a kept…

37:36.577 --> 37:38.996
Look, he may have been having
an affair, but I didn't know.

37:39.036 --> 37:40.702
I knew nothing about any of this.

37:40.742 --> 37:42.443
You knew that a composite

37:42.443 --> 37:45.343
was being circulated around
the bars in your neighborhood.

37:45.383 --> 37:47.224
You told me so yourself.

37:47.834 --> 37:49.108
And, uh…

37:49.597 --> 37:52.082
Do you remember
purchasing an aluminum bat

37:52.122 --> 37:55.158
at the Big 5 Sporting
Goods store 3 weeks ago?

37:55.165 --> 37:56.822
It was charged to one
of the joint accounts

37:56.862 --> 37:58.845
that you shared with
your domestic partner.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.957
You bought a suit from Nordstrom's

38:00.997 --> 38:02.977
on the same account yesterday.

38:03.004 --> 38:04.631
To wear to Clint's funeral.

38:04.671 --> 38:05.802
You find that strange?

38:05.842 --> 38:08.986
I do, because those
credit cards were stolen.

38:09.860 --> 38:12.566
Why didn't you cancel
those credit cards?

38:12.693 --> 38:14.153
Mr Anderson…

38:14.317 --> 38:16.342
Because you knew where they were.

38:16.382 --> 38:19.013
Because after you
bludgeoned Clint to death,

38:19.053 --> 38:21.819
you threw everything away in
the pond across the street.

38:21.859 --> 38:23.179
What you didn't know

38:23.260 --> 38:26.452
was that Clint was wearing a
necklace underneath his t-shirt

38:26.492 --> 38:27.977
given to him by someone else,

38:28.017 --> 38:32.141
someone younger, someone
in a little better shape,

38:32.176 --> 38:35.740
someone with whom he was
having, from the looks of it…

38:36.705 --> 38:38.796
A great deal of fun.

38:40.337 --> 38:42.358
How did it make you feel, Mr Anderson,

38:42.398 --> 38:45.580
knowing that the boy that you'd
taken care of for quite a long time

38:45.620 --> 38:47.363
was about to grab half your assets

38:47.403 --> 38:51.561
and spend them doing drugs and
having sex with a guy like this?

38:59.860 --> 39:02.131
He used to call it beauty prison,

39:02.198 --> 39:05.772
the gym he worked out at.

39:05.840 --> 39:09.447
The guys there forced
to work out 5 days a week

39:09.513 --> 39:11.955
just to look great on Saturday night.

39:13.789 --> 39:16.495
Get high, go dance.

39:16.562 --> 39:20.870
Repeat same empty routine every week.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.848
Our relationship was different.

39:25.914 --> 39:28.753
We… we had a ceremony.

39:28.820 --> 39:30.456
Our… our parents came,

39:30.523 --> 39:32.459
everyone I worked with,

39:32.527 --> 39:34.375
my… my friends from college.

39:35.066 --> 39:36.629
Did you have a photographer?

39:36.669 --> 39:38.540
Screw Julian Carver.

39:38.608 --> 39:39.742
I loved Clint.

39:39.809 --> 39:41.980
I loved him.

39:47.859 --> 39:50.899
Oh, good god.

39:50.965 --> 39:52.969
Good god.

39:55.408 --> 39:59.015
I begged him not to
go, not to humiliate me

39:59.081 --> 40:02.522
and to… to allow
these photographs to…

40:03.658 --> 40:05.327
Oh, god.

40:06.630 --> 40:08.936
None of this was easy.

40:09.002 --> 40:10.940
I had given him everything.

40:11.007 --> 40:13.611
What had he given me?

40:13.679 --> 40:14.975
I never wanted to hurt him.

40:15.015 --> 40:16.985
I was trying to work it out.

40:17.887 --> 40:19.510
But then I realized…

40:19.643 --> 40:22.085
This was supposed to be a hate crime.

40:22.212 --> 40:23.660
Oh, I think it was.

40:24.513 --> 40:27.115
How am I going to explain
this to the community?

40:27.155 --> 40:29.222
Well, you've been trying for years

40:29.262 --> 40:33.088
to prove that gay and straight
marriages are pretty much the same.

40:33.128 --> 40:35.438
I think this guy's done it for you.

40:38.824 --> 40:40.650
He was killing me, too,

40:41.001 --> 40:42.611
and us.

40:43.432 --> 40:45.970
He was killing us.

40:51.431 --> 40:54.915
I think I might have
allowed my competitive nature

40:54.982 --> 40:58.823
to get the better of me in my
desire to protect the community,

40:58.863 --> 41:00.588
but I don't think anyone

41:00.655 --> 41:03.602
should mistake my
dedication to this department

41:03.642 --> 41:05.692
or lieutenant Flynn's, for that matter.

41:05.732 --> 41:08.844
It's not the department you've
been treating like crap. It's me.

41:08.884 --> 41:10.901
Partly that's because you've
been getting mixed signals,

41:10.941 --> 41:13.556
so let's see if we can't
straighten things out.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.613
Chief Johnson, if I have offended you,

41:15.653 --> 41:17.278
naturally I apologize.

41:17.344 --> 41:20.032
Oh, I don't want an apology from you.

41:20.099 --> 41:22.541
I want an acknowledgement of my rank,

41:22.554 --> 41:25.200
I want an understanding
that you are beneath me

41:25.240 --> 41:26.495
in the chain of command,

41:26.535 --> 41:28.419
and I want you to be officially warned

41:28.459 --> 41:32.667
that if you make any further attempt
to undermine my investigations,

41:32.707 --> 41:35.620
chief Pope will recommend an
inquiry by internal affairs,

41:35.660 --> 41:37.711
which is, I believe,
the established procedure

41:37.751 --> 41:42.427
when investigating an
insubordinate officer.

41:42.494 --> 41:43.955
Are we all agreed?

41:45.945 --> 41:49.296
I see nothing improper in that request.

41:49.362 --> 41:51.021
Good.

41:51.087 --> 41:53.478
Now thank you so much.

42:03.531 --> 42:04.526
Bye, y'all.

42:04.592 --> 42:06.192
See you tomorrow.

42:12.010 --> 42:13.993
Sir, I think I should point out

42:14.033 --> 42:16.968
I only got the confession
that you ordered me to get.

42:17.008 --> 42:20.197
Yeah. Greg, hardly
know how to thank you.

42:23.493 --> 42:26.204
On the other hand…

42:26.273 --> 42:29.375
you may have accomplished
more than I expected.

42:49.082 --> 42:50.733
Oh, hello, mama.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.249
Yes.

42:52.316 --> 42:56.391
And here's mommy.

42:56.459 --> 42:58.045
Here's mommy.

43:04.786 --> 43:06.759
Oh, you shouldn't have.

43:06.824 --> 43:08.053
Come in.

43:08.117 --> 43:10.342
Thought this might
solve a problem for you.

43:10.382 --> 43:12.735
Aw, they already have a place to live.

43:12.775 --> 43:14.491
Oh, no. This is better.

43:14.555 --> 43:15.545
This is better.

43:15.558 --> 43:18.307
For the time being.

43:18.372 --> 43:21.113
Honestly, I can't think
what to do with him.

43:21.153 --> 43:22.674
Her. It's a her.

43:22.738 --> 43:25.869
I know. I know. It's just
I liked him better as a boy.

43:25.909 --> 43:29.596
And I'd get rid of him, too, but I…

43:29.661 --> 43:31.149
They're so cute.

43:31.215 --> 43:32.961
Well, yeah.

43:33.026 --> 43:34.094
And I…

43:34.157 --> 43:36.188
You just don't have the
emotional wherewithal

43:36.228 --> 43:38.604
to break up with your cat right now.

43:40.238 --> 43:41.404
Yeah.

43:41.469 --> 43:45.221
And just to show you I
understand how difficult it is

43:45.285 --> 43:49.409
to keep a pair together these days…

43:53.034 --> 43:54.826
Oh, Fritz.

43:54.894 --> 43:57.269
Thank you.

43:57.338 --> 44:01.710
Oh, my mother gave me these
when I moved to Georgetown,

44:01.779 --> 44:03.706
and I just…

44:03.776 --> 44:06.220
My pillow thank you, too.

44:06.289 --> 44:09.348
Well, what about the rest of you?
