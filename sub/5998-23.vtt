00:01.102 --> 00:04.503
- I could get used to this.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.538
- Stella?
- What are you doing here?

00:06.540 --> 00:09.608
- I felt so lonely.
I can't survive without you.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.044
- Alderman Casey, Susan Weller.
Political consultant.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.146
<i>I think you've got</i>
<i>a national future ahead of you</i>

00:14.148 --> 00:16.048
and I can get you there.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.050
<i>- I might actually</i>
<i>have a shot</i>

00:18.052 --> 00:19.518
at fostering Louie
after all.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.387
- What?
- You two have a connection.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.455
I won't let that
go unnoticed.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.391
- I can't stop going over it
in my head.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.127
[grunts]
- [groans]

00:28.129 --> 00:29.795
- Chief never makes
the decision lightly.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.663
- Well, he was dead wrong!

00:48.548 --> 00:50.049
- Hey, Chief.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.517
Do you really need these
by end of shift,

00:51.519 --> 00:54.119
or can we think on them some?

00:54.121 --> 00:58.424
- On my third shift
as candidate on Truck,

00:58.426 --> 01:01.593
we lost Mikey Philo
in the Superior fire.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.529
We all got back to the house,

01:03.531 --> 01:05.497
pulled off our turnout gear,
put on our work boots.

01:05.499 --> 01:11.136
Mikey's boots had just
stood untouched for a month

01:14.407 --> 01:18.410
That was a reminder.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.180
These are about
having no regrets.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.516
So...
end of shift, please.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.364
- It was tougher
than I expected.

01:39.366 --> 01:43.702
- Yeah, well, it's a tradition
worth bringing back.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.738
- Chief.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.340
Hey, sorry I'm late, guys.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.609
- Um, let's go talk
in my office.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.611
- If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to get changed

01:52.613 --> 01:54.213
and get to work.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.181
- Okay,
go get dressed.

01:58.718 --> 02:00.819
It goes without saying,
people,

02:00.821 --> 02:04.690
we are here for him,
whatever he needs.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.862
- Dawson, someone here
to see you, apparatus floor.

02:15.768 --> 02:17.269
- Hey, Ms. Cantrell.

02:17.271 --> 02:20.139
- I was on my way in and
realized I'm still waiting

02:20.141 --> 02:21.874
for an update on your
living situation.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.542
- I know. I'm close.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.177
Just dotting
a couple of "I"s.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.880
- I'm under pressure
to place Louie with a family.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.850
- I'm looking at an apartment
as soon as shift's over

02:31.852 --> 02:33.152
that's be perfect for us.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.753
Give me three,
four days tops,

02:34.755 --> 02:36.421
and I'll be ready
for a home inspection.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.757
- I sympathize.
I do.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.860
But there are other worthy
foster families in line,

02:41.862 --> 02:46.431
and for the child's well-being,
I can't delay any longer.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.666
Two days.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.168
<i>[alarm blares]</i>

- Jimmy,
are you sure about this?

02:57.711 --> 02:59.178
- Yeah, let's go.

you guys are done.

Jimmy, hey.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.502
I'm sorry.

03:26.839 --> 03:29.474
- Jimmy, come on.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.944
- Borrelli, I'm sorry about
your brother.

03:31.946 --> 03:33.212
- Thanks, Chief.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.580
- Where do you need us,
Chief Hatcher?

03:34.582 --> 03:37.416
- I've got some smoke inhalation
victims over there by 152.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.718
Randolph!

03:44.424 --> 03:46.325
- Okay?
- Everybody okay?

03:46.327 --> 03:48.293
- Belzer, Grimes,
do you copy?

03:48.295 --> 03:50.262
Report!

03:51.831 --> 03:53.832
- Set him down.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.436
- The floor gave away.
We found him in the hallway.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.670
- He looks pretty clean.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.972
How far was he
from the collapse?

03:59.974 --> 04:01.640
- About 50 feet.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.609
- I'm not getting a pulse.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.280
- He's having a heart attack.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.982
I'm gonna start compressions.
- Okay.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.017
- Is he dying?
- No way.

04:14.821 --> 04:17.389
Come on, man.
Come on.

04:20.660 --> 04:24.029
- Hey, Jimmy, slow down.
- Borrelli, calm down.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.933
- Breathe.
- Jimmy. Jimmy.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.269
- Breathe.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.703
- Jimmy, stop.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.538
Hey, hey, look at me.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.975
Look at my face.
I need you to calm down.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.511
Just breathe.
Nice steady rhythm.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.547
I'm gonna put the pads on him.
We've got this.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.583
All right,

05:17.017 --> 05:37.502
- Hey, how goes the hunt
for Chez Dawson?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.404
- Uh...

05:39.406 --> 05:41.006
I'm waiting on my realtor.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.874
We're supposed to see a place
the day after tomorrow,

05:42.876 --> 05:45.610
but I--
I've got to see it sooner.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.813
- What are these?
- Backups.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.349
- Caesarstone countertops.
Fancy.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.616
- 300 over budget.

05:51.618 --> 05:54.786
- Ooh, you know what?

05:54.788 --> 05:57.055
This is a crazy idea,
but Cindy and I,

05:57.057 --> 05:59.124
we got an in-law apartment
above our garage.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.027
- You would actually evict
that family of bats?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.062
- No, I appreciate it, guys,
but I'm looking for something

06:04.064 --> 06:06.131
that's already set up
and ready to go.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.766
- All right.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.776
- There is a simpler solution.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.011
Move back in with me.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.113
Severide will understand,

06:21.115 --> 06:22.981
and the place will look great
to the DCFS.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.083
- Matt, no.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.954
We both know that's not
what you want.

Hello.

Yeah. Okay.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.998
They can show the place
right now if I...

06:40.000 --> 06:41.133
- Yeah, go.

06:41.135 --> 06:42.834
- Thank you.
I'm on my way.

06:46.672 --> 06:50.075

06:51.544 --> 06:54.780
- Uh-oh.
Who's in trouble?

06:54.782 --> 06:56.515
- [laughs]

06:56.517 --> 06:58.984
Ohh, who do you think?

06:58.986 --> 07:02.988
Grant's been texting nonstop
since I didn't go to his gig.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.089
- He still using?

07:04.091 --> 07:07.826
- Mm,
four minutes ago:

07:07.828 --> 07:10.562
"I hope you burn
to death slowly."

07:10.564 --> 07:11.997
Hmm,
two minutes ago:

07:11.999 --> 07:14.633
"I'm sorry, baby.
I love you."

07:14.635 --> 07:16.034
- You want me to talk to him?

07:16.036 --> 07:18.870
- Given our history, I think
you're probably the last person

07:18.872 --> 07:21.139
that he wants to talk to.

07:21.141 --> 07:26.077
Oh, but what can you do?

07:26.079 --> 07:28.814
You know, this whole thing
is making me really tense.

07:28.816 --> 07:29.881
- Ahh.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.683
- And, you know, like,
my neck and my back.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.586
- Oh, sounds rough.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.788
- Maybe you should come over
after shift.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.590
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:40.526 --> 07:44.463
[engine revving]

07:53.206 --> 07:54.673
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.641
- Just who I came to see.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.776
I've got good news.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.077
- Yeah, what's that?

08:00.746 --> 08:03.882
is holding a three-day summit
to discuss public safety issues,

08:03.884 --> 08:06.518
and you are now
an official invitee.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.954
- And somehow this is good news?

08:08.956 --> 08:11.957
- Yes, because the Director
of Emergency Management

08:11.959 --> 08:13.925
will be there, and getting
real face time with him

08:13.927 --> 08:15.760
is crucial if you want
to make inroads

08:15.762 --> 08:17.762
in updating
Chicago's 911 system.

08:17.764 --> 08:20.165
- She's not wrong.
It would go a long way.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.967
- I already booked
a pair of rooms

08:21.969 --> 08:24.169
with stunning parking lot views
at the Springfield Marriott.

08:33.579 --> 08:35.046
- The neighborhood's safe,

08:35.048 --> 08:38.116
and the folks in 4B have
two little ones of their own.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.784
- It's perfect.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.119
- And with the park
across the street,

08:41.121 --> 08:44.756
you two'll be spending all of
your time outside in the summer.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.558
- How much?

08:46.560 --> 08:49.160
- It's a little more
than you said you could afford.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.795
In fact,
it's a lot more.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.666
- I'll take it.

You guys meant the world

10:23.289 --> 10:26.791
- Hey, I wanted to ask you

10:26.793 --> 10:29.294
about the choices
that were made that day.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.329
- You mean by Boden?

10:31.331 --> 10:33.665
And that extra minute?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.700
The building was coming down.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.937
We all saw it.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.139
It's all I can do
not to drive over there

10:41.141 --> 10:43.174
and punch him in the mouth.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.176
If you want to get out
from under that bastard,

10:45.178 --> 10:49.180
I'll sign your pink myself,
transfer you here.

10:49.182 --> 11:05.363
- Application's in, which
it should be a rubber stamp.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.066
So that means it's all about
the home inspection.

11:09.702 --> 11:12.937
- I sincerely offered my place
to make it work,

11:12.939 --> 11:14.773
and you dismissed it flat.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.743
I'm trying, Gabby.

11:18.745 --> 11:21.179
- Well, don't.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.447
You shouldn't have to try.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.416
I'm gonna do what's right
for Louie,

11:24.418 --> 11:26.117
and that starts with
giving him a home

11:26.119 --> 11:28.119
where he feels
incredibly wanted.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.057
- Be honest with yourself,
Matt.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.191
I want something
that you don't.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.359
I'm ready,
and you're not.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.927
It's not a crime,

11:35.929 --> 11:37.729
and it doesn't make you
any less of a man.

11:40.733 --> 11:43.768
- I'll be off next shift.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.303
There's a summit
on public safety in Springfield,

11:45.305 --> 11:46.971
and Susan wants me to go.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.941
- Susan.

- Chief.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.361
- Ah, close the door.
Have a seat.

12:21.941 --> 12:25.376
Coming back to work

12:25.378 --> 12:27.178
is never easy.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.947

or wrong time to do it.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.818
- Well, I can appreciate
you feel that way.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.353
- Good.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.957
- Okay.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.425
I got a phone call
from Chief Hatcher.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.494
He said that you were
pretty aggressive

12:42.496 --> 12:43.828
in your last run.

12:43.830 --> 12:47.532
I need your head working
as much as your heart.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.334
Focus, clarity.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.069
That saves lives.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.437
- We saved a life today.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.938
What about you?

12:56.242 --> 12:58.076
- Excuse me?

12:58.078 --> 13:01.079
- I was just thinking
that as a chief

13:01.081 --> 13:02.881
you do a lot of telling people
what to do

13:02.883 --> 13:05.049
without actually doing
very much yourself.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.089
Anything else?

13:13.425 --> 13:14.826
- No.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.103
Leave it open.

13:31.944 --> 13:34.879
Deputy District Chief's Office,

Chief Tiberg?
Yes.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.488
We need to talk
about Jimmy Borrelli.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.967
- Yeah.

13:58.103 --> 14:01.439
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

14:01.441 --> 14:04.242
- Well, up until about
ten seconds ago,

14:04.244 --> 14:08.246
I had the bang-up idea
of forgiving you

14:08.248 --> 14:09.547
for not coming to my show,
and--I don't know--

14:09.549 --> 14:12.584
maybe sweeping you off
your feet,

14:12.586 --> 14:16.554
but now I know exactly
what's going on.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.023
- Are we really having
this conversation again?

14:19.025 --> 14:20.225
- You're disgusting.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.626
- What?
- You're nasty.

14:21.628 --> 14:25.230
You...you--
have a nice life, Stella.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.598
Have a real great life,
you know,

14:26.600 --> 14:28.366
'cause I was just fine
before you,

14:28.368 --> 14:31.402
and I'm gonna be fine
long after you.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.205
That's for sure.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.340
Just some bitch
I used to nail.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.375
That's all.
- Okay.

14:49.922 --> 14:52.390
Safe to say he got
the message.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.658
- Looks like he took it well.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.928
- Okay, all right,
let's talk about anything,

14:56.930 --> 14:59.497
anything at all besides me.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.332
- Home study
with the DCFS inspector

15:01.334 --> 15:03.234
scheduled for tomorrow,
check.

15:03.236 --> 15:07.071
Realtor on her way
with the lease right now, check.

15:07.073 --> 15:10.241
- Gabriela Dawson kicking ass
and taking names.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.477
Check, check.
- [laughs]

15:12.479 --> 15:14.178
- Good luck.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.047
- Casey's in Springfield?

15:16.049 --> 15:18.449
- Saving the world as usual.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.518
- Need I remind you
you wanted him

15:20.520 --> 15:22.287
to run for alderman.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.389
- Yeah, I know.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.691
- But you want him here?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.626
- Not if he doesn't want
to be here.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.000
Vanessa.

15:37.236 --> 15:38.403
What?

15:38.405 --> 15:41.606
- I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.976
- I really tried to change
his mind.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.311
- Whose?
- The landlord's.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.979
He's gonna give the apartment
to his daughter.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.213
She just graduated
from college.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.381
- No.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.116
- Give me a couple of days
to dig.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.385
I'll find something else.
I promise.

15:54.387 --> 16:11.035
- Okay.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.704
Agh.

16:12.706 --> 16:15.039
Don't--
don't worry about that door.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.574
We'll get that fixed up,
no problem.

16:16.576 --> 16:20.712
Yeah,
so it might need a little TLC

16:22.715 --> 16:26.250
Hey,
when's that inspector coming by?

16:26.252 --> 16:29.120
- Uh...6:00 p.m.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.355
- Okay.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.657
- Today.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.728
- All right.
Okay, well, you know,

16:36.730 --> 16:38.663
it might not be
a Gold Coast penthouse,

16:38.665 --> 16:41.199
but, you know,
it's got a special charm

16:41.201 --> 16:42.200
about it,
you know.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.668
[sink rattling]

16:43.670 --> 16:48.306
- Ahh, I should've warned you
about that.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.640
Sorry.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.510

move some stuff around.

17:03.589 --> 17:07.158
I won that stupid monkey
at Navy Pier,

17:07.160 --> 17:08.793
and I'll be damned if it wasn't

17:08.795 --> 17:11.562
every one of my kids'
favorite toy.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.166
There's something about it.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.107
- This place is perfect,
Herrmann.

17:23.109 --> 17:26.511
Thank you.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.813
- No problem, kid.

Anything for you.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.684
I'm calling in reinforcements.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.791
- We've got four hours.
- Ah...

17:42.094 --> 17:45.329
- We can do this.
We have to.

17:45.331 --> 17:48.633
- Not standing here
like a bunch of boobs we can't.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.568
Let's go, people.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.348

- And here we go.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.554
Senators Reynard and Twigg

of Emergency Management.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.290
- Copy.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.392
- Director Hanson,
you owe me a phone call.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.295
- And a Glenlivet on the rocks.
Hello, Susan.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.866

heard amazing things about you.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.568
- All lies, all lies.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.570

18:32.412 --> 18:34.212
- Three-day work week.
Must be nice.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.817
- When we're not running into
burning buildings,

18:39.819 --> 18:42.253
I guess it is nice,
sure.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.754
- These guys do amazing work.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.490
We're going to grab lunch.
You should join us.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.591
- We should.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.626
Matt wants to talk to you
about the 911 system.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.595
- That's right, I would.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.631

that scotch with the appetizers.

He'll be doing the evaluation.

19:19.859 --> 19:20.925
- Yes, hi.

Thank you so much
for coming today.

there's another family.

the Gambrells.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.428
They have three foster kids
currently,

to take Louie tomorrow.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.299
- Yeah, yes.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.701
We just touched it up
a little bit.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.603
I wanted everything
to be perfect for Louie.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.972
Oh, here, let me give you a hand
with that.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.452
- I was in a jam.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.687
I had an apartment
lined up,

20:56.689 --> 20:58.990
but it fell through,
and my friends rallied

20:58.992 --> 21:00.725
to get this place
the best they could

21:00.727 --> 21:01.926
with the time that we had.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.694
And I know it needs
a lot of work,

21:03.696 --> 21:05.997
but believe me when I say
that my firehouse family

21:05.999 --> 21:09.000
made a miracle happen today.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.035
And it's just a taste
of the love Louie's gonna get

21:15.040 --> 21:17.041
- Okay, thank you.

21:20.512 --> 21:21.846
We'll be in touch.

Wants to invite you out
to Medinah.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.926
- Good.
And the 911 system?

21:35.928 --> 21:37.928
- You've got his support,
but now you've got to convince

21:37.930 --> 21:39.764
the appropriations committee.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.465
- Okay.

21:44.703 --> 21:46.737
- Chief.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.306
- Jimmy, come on in.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.473
- I want to talk to you
about Danny.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.708
- As do I.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.543
I had a conversation
with Chief Tiberg.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.779
He and I both thought that maybe
the best way to keep

21:54.781 --> 21:56.981
your brother's memory alive
would be for you to take

21:56.983 --> 21:59.083
Danny's badge number
for your own.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.584
That is,
if you're interested.

22:00.586 --> 22:03.621
And we can present the badge
officially at the memorial.

22:09.361 --> 22:12.530
Okay, Jimmy.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.332
I know you're going over
that day in your head.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.468
I'm doing the same thing,

22:17.470 --> 22:19.637
but that's how we all improve.

22:19.639 --> 22:24.508
That's how future lives
are saved.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.577
- One minute.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.747
That is what you said,
and it got him killed.

22:29.749 --> 22:33.818
- Your brother thought
he heard someone.

22:33.820 --> 22:37.121
He made a choice
to go back in.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.857
I as chief made a choice
to let him.

22:41.059 --> 22:44.528
- A choice?
- Yeah.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.465
Just like I made the choice
to come in and get you.

22:55.407 --> 22:57.775
Your brother made a sacrifice

22:57.777 --> 23:01.011
for something
that he believed in.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.047
And he died a hero.
