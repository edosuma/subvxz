WEBVTT

00:04.200 --> 00:05.840
Are you fucking deaf?

00:08.360 --> 00:10.600
I said, are you fucking deaf?

00:10.680 --> 00:15.800
If you are, then you may be thinking of
investing in a digital hearing aid.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.640
Audio Clear Hearing Aids
are discreet and...

00:18.720 --> 00:21.160
-Is this for real?
-What's up, Steven?

00:21.240 --> 00:24.960
Well, there's swearing in this advert.
All kinds of effing and jeffing.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.160
Are you really allowed
to broadcast this on the radio?

00:27.240 --> 00:29.920
I mean, even Channel 4 doesn't have
swearing in their adverts.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.120
Anything goes these days.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.680
-It's the 21st century, my friend.
-[Toast] Oh, God, yeah.

00:33.760 --> 00:37.400
No taboos left anywhere anymore.
OK, let's crack on.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.720
Actually, I've gotta go.
I'll see you next week Steven.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.160
[kissing sounds]

00:45.080 --> 00:47.280
[quietly] What the blazes is this ritual?

00:49.120 --> 00:50.520
[kissing continues]

00:53.640 --> 00:54.960
[Danny mimics gunshot]

00:56.800 --> 00:58.000
Where's that clown off to?

00:58.080 --> 00:59.360
To see his therapist.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.680
His therapist? Ha!
That doesn't surprise me.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.560
Danny's considering
a sex change operation.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.440
A sex change operation?

01:05.519 --> 01:08.440
Mostly because he thinks his clothes
will suit him better if he's a woman.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.200
Something he's been mulling over.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.120
-[snorts]
-Talking to a therapist about it.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.240
Well, I've heard everything. Sex change
operations, swearing in adverts...

01:17.320 --> 01:19.880
These really are the last days of Sodom.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.000
-Wanna try that line again there, Steven?
-Yeah.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.960
Audio Clear Hearing Aids
are discreet and fit snugly into the ear.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.160
Check out our website today for de-tails.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.800
How the fuck was that?

02:00.320 --> 02:02.320
[Jane]  Nuts.  Do you remember?

02:02.400 --> 02:04.000
That musical you did about the...

02:04.080 --> 02:06.240
the horrors of mental illness.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.160
Uh, probably the worst production
I've ever been in.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.800
Yes, you've been in more than
your fair share of bad productions.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.360
Yeah, Ray Purchase was in that.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.640
Played an out-of-control schizophrenic
called Magpie,

02:18.720 --> 02:21.600
and used that as an excuse
to pinch everyone's fags

02:21.680 --> 02:24.520
and I swore I'd never work with him again.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.800
Yes. Do you remember
you opened the trap door on stage

02:27.880 --> 02:29.400
and he fell right through?

02:29.480 --> 02:30.720
[laughs] Yes, he did!

02:30.800 --> 02:34.760
I will make my nest. I will be happy.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.560
-[trap door opens]
-[audience gasps]

02:37.120 --> 02:39.080
[groans]

02:39.160 --> 02:42.080
People told me he'd broken his back,
but he hadn't.

02:42.160 --> 02:46.680
-Just his arm and his collarbone. [laughs]
-Yes.

02:47.240 --> 02:52.040
Anyway, while I'm here, any news
on my Dickie Davies biopic audition?

02:52.120 --> 02:56.720
Dickie Davies audition... That was a no.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.760
A no? How can it be a no, Jane?

02:59.840 --> 03:03.240
-I look exactly like him.
-Ooh! Now, this is really big news!

03:03.320 --> 03:06.080
The Royal Variety Performance people
have been on.

03:06.160 --> 03:10.760
They'd like you to take part this year,
in the newly re-opened Regency Theatre.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.120
The Regency Theatre?
Isn't that now a Chicken Paradise?

03:14.200 --> 03:16.480
Yes, it was in a dreadful state,

03:16.560 --> 03:21.480
but then a lot of showbiz folk got
together to buy it back and refurbish it.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.840
I'm not doing
the Royal Variety Performance, Jane.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.840
All charity work is
a complete waste of time and money

03:26.920 --> 03:30.440
and usually does more harm than good.
Remember Live Aid?

03:30.520 --> 03:34.880
They'd like you to perform
the Amazing Egyptian Sand Dance,

03:34.960 --> 03:37.000
made famous in the 1930s.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.080
The bloody sand dance?
I've not done that for years.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.440
[chuckles]

03:41.520 --> 03:45.440
Hold on a second.
You need two performers for that routine.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.720
Yes, so I suggested um...

03:48.560 --> 03:50.320
[Toast] What, Ray bloody Purchase?

03:50.400 --> 03:53.440
I told you two seconds ago
I never wanted to work with him again.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.040
-Did you?
-Well, maybe not two seconds,

03:56.120 --> 03:58.240
but certainly in the very recent past.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.080
OK, OK. I shall demand they don't ask
Ray Purchase to perform with you.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.040
That'll be an absolute non-starter.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.960
Ah... I'm not doing any charity work,
Jane, for anyone ever.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.720
Oh, here's a thing...
Kevin Spacey'll be there.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.640
-Who?
-Kevin Spacey?

04:14.320 --> 04:17.959
Major actor, director
and big player in Hollywood.

04:18.040 --> 04:22.200
He's become very immersed
in the whole London scene.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.680
Rumor has it, he's looking for someone
to play the British attaché

04:25.760 --> 04:27.560
in the new series of the  House of Cards.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.280
I'll do it. This charity event,
count me in.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.920
You've changed your tune, Toast.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.640
All a waste of time and money
a second ago.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.720
Obviously I know who Kevin Spacey is.

04:37.800 --> 04:41.200
I just said "who" to give me some time
to think about the offer.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.600
British attaché. [laughs]

04:43.680 --> 04:47.560
Yes, yes,  House of Cards.
I'll be splendid in that.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.120
-Ever seen it?
-No.

04:50.440 --> 04:54.320
Anyway, who's presenting
at this Royal Variety Performance?

04:54.400 --> 04:55.680
Bob Monkhouse!

04:55.760 --> 04:58.040
-Isn't he dead?
-No!

04:58.120 --> 05:02.040
Why does everybody say that?
Bob is very much alive.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.560
He's just got remarried, in fact.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.600
Apparently, his new wife's
a complete zombie.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.240
Anyway, I'll tell them you're on board.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.320
India, Royal Variety. Patch me through.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.720
I hate the Royal Variety Performance,
but if Kevin Spacey sees me in it,

05:17.800 --> 05:20.400
he's bound to cast me
as the British attaché

05:20.480 --> 05:22.760
in the new series of  House of Cards.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.680
Sorry, Toast. I was just reading a review

05:26.760 --> 05:29.920
of the revival of
The Government Inspector  at the Lyric.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.080
It's not very good.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.760
I was saying... I mean,
I hate the Royal Variety Performance,

05:35.840 --> 05:37.720
but if Kevin Spacey sees me in it,

05:37.800 --> 05:40.880
he's bound to cast me
as the British attaché.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.800
Sorry, Toast, I was just reading a review

05:44.880 --> 05:47.680
of the revival of
Abigail's Party  at the Young Vic.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.680
Not very good.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.240
I was saying, I hate the
Royal Variety Performance but if, oh...

05:54.320 --> 05:55.840
Hang on, old chap. I was reading that!

06:02.560 --> 06:03.960
[door opens and closes]

06:04.040 --> 06:06.200
-Who the hell is that?
-That'll be for me.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.160
[man] Here's your magazines, Ed.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.000
-What is it, Ed?
-It's some copies of  Woman's Realm.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.960
Woman's Realm?
I didn't think that was still going.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.280
It isn't. These are vintage copies.
It's very hard to find.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.400
I'm a bit of a collector.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.560
Well, isn't it just knitting patterns
for old ladies?

06:31.120 --> 06:33.360
-Oh, yes.
-Oh, God!

06:33.440 --> 06:36.120
-Who delivered them, John Nettles?
-No, he does  Tit-Bits.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.360
This is a chap called Larry Muggins.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.920
Anything you want, he can find.
Probably at a discount price.

06:41.000 --> 06:41.920
-Really?
-Oh, yes.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.160
Yes, anything from
a rare edition of a Ken Follett novel

06:45.240 --> 06:47.000
to a sex change operation.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.720
-Sex change operation?
-Oh, yes.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.880
Well, that idiot, Danny Bear,
at Scramble Studios

06:51.960 --> 06:54.560
was talking about getting
a sex change operation.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.240
Reckoned it would suit his clothes.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.160
Oh, this chap Muggins
can probably organize it for him.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.440
And there's likely to be a queue
for the op at the NHS.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.760
I can put in a word if you like.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.040
Well, you know, why not?
It's no odds to me.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.920
So, who's hosting
the Royal Variety Performance this year?

07:09.000 --> 07:12.080
-Bob Monkhouse.
-Bob Monkhouse?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.880
Thanks for coming, old chap.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.320
With a name like Toast,
I thought you'd pop up.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.000
-[laughter]
-Glad you decided to become involved.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.520
Jane said you don't usually
do any charity work.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.480
Uh, not true at all.
You're thinking of Dickie Davies.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.560
Weather's been very warm, hasn't it?
Especially at nights.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.360
These days, I love to sleep in the nude.

07:32.440 --> 07:37.000
Not a bad thing, except, of course,
on those really long flights.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.720
-[laughter]
-What?

07:38.800 --> 07:41.840
Anyway, meet the organizing committee
before we go down to the theater.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.040
Hello, Dennis Fog.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.600
-Dense Fog?
-No, Dennis Fog.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.200
-Sorry, nice to meet you.
-Hello, Derek Bildings.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.360
-Derelict Buildings?
-No, Derek Bildings.

07:51.440 --> 07:54.680
-Sorry, nice to meet you.
-Hello, uh, Shane Fulorgy.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.160
-Shameful Orgy?
-Shane Fulorgy.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.120
Sorry, nice to meet you.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.800
I never wanted to believe my dad was
stealing from his job as a road worker,

08:02.880 --> 08:05.240
but when I got home,
all the signs were there.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.640
[laughter]

08:07.720 --> 08:10.840
Anyway, I just wanna say, uh,
how it warms my heart

08:10.920 --> 08:13.680
that so many top turns are willing
to give their time to charity.

08:14.640 --> 08:15.800
[voice whispers]  Ray!

08:15.880 --> 08:18.280
Ray bloody Purchase!

08:18.360 --> 08:22.720
Well, well, well...
If it isn't Steven Toast.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.720
Tell us more about
your substantial charity work, Toast.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.600
I'd love to hear about it.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.520
I specifically told Jane
I never wanted to work with you again.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.120
Well, tough tit, Toast.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.559
Steven Toast, everyone.

08:36.159 --> 08:39.280
He'll buy you a pint with one hand
and sleep with your wife with the other.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.120
Why don't you shut up and sit down?

08:41.600 --> 08:43.000
[Bob] Here's a thing I've noticed.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.040
People seem to think I come from Kent.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.200
I hear them mutter the word
as I walk past.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.360
-[all laugh except Toast]
-[Toast] What?

08:49.440 --> 08:52.440
I'm really looking forward to this.
You know Kevin Spacey's gonna be there?

08:52.520 --> 08:53.720
I didn't know that.

08:53.800 --> 08:57.560
Yes, you did. I know for a fact
that Jane Plough told you about it.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.400
She texted me, she emailed me,
she wrote me a postcard,

09:00.480 --> 09:03.360
she told me to my face that she
definitely, definitely told you about it.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.520
Did she? Well, I must have forgotten.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.240
[Bob] And we've just heard this morning

09:08.320 --> 09:11.880
that Prince Charles and his
delightful wife, Camilla Parker Bowles,

09:11.960 --> 09:13.960
are also coming along.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.560
Now, I think it would be a terrific idea

09:15.640 --> 09:17.720
to present them
with a souvenir of the occasion.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.000
Who wants to look after that?

09:19.680 --> 09:24.440
I think Toast should be in charge
of securing the gift for the royal couple.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.120
-Really?
-Yes, great idea.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.240
Talking of royals,

09:29.320 --> 09:32.240
do you know what happened
during Kate Middleton's wedding night?

09:32.320 --> 09:34.440
-No.
-She was held against her Will.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.880
-[all laugh except Toast]
-[Toast] What?

09:36.960 --> 09:40.440
Gosh, is that the time? We need
to get down to the stage to rehearse.

09:40.520 --> 09:44.040
Right, chaps, we'll take the lift,
there's too many stairs.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.160
Come along, darling.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.600
[scary music]

09:50.800 --> 09:52.240
[elevator beeps]

09:56.120 --> 09:58.960
[snarls]

10:00.720 --> 10:03.160
[continues snarling]

10:03.880 --> 10:04.880
[exhales]

10:08.400 --> 10:10.880
[grunts]

10:10.960 --> 10:14.160
-[grunts]
-[horse neighs]

10:14.240 --> 10:16.320
[snarls]

10:19.000 --> 10:20.240
Sorry, Mrs. P.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.760
I can't get Bob Monkhouse's
zombie wife's face out of my head.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.480
I thought Bob Monkhouse was dead.

10:26.560 --> 10:30.640
No, he's very much alive. As is his wife.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.240
-Well, technically, she's dead.
-Living dead, surely?

10:34.320 --> 10:38.160
Anyway, Monkhouse
did a very strange thing.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.880
He kept telling these stories
that were unconnected to anything

10:41.960 --> 10:43.240
and then everyone would laugh.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.760
-Well, they're probably jokes.
-Jokes?

10:46.840 --> 10:49.880
Yes, Monkhouse is famous
for telling jokes all the time.

10:49.960 --> 10:53.120
-[laptop beeps]
-[rocket sounds]

10:53.200 --> 10:54.400
What are you doing, Mrs. P?

10:54.480 --> 10:56.240
Oh, it's my new job.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.800
You've got a job? [laughs]
What the hell is it?

10:59.880 --> 11:02.280
Operating drones for the US military.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.920
-Really?
-Yes.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.680
It's perfect for me, actually,
because I can work from home.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.920
Do you know, depending on
how many missiles I launch,

11:09.000 --> 11:10.720
I can earn up to 30 quid a day.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.800
[rocket sound]

11:11.880 --> 11:14.440
-Drones for the US military?
-Mm-hm.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.200
-[doorbell]
-I'd better get that.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.400
Do you want a go? It's very easy.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.000
You just move this cursor,

11:20.080 --> 11:22.880
then when you select your target,
you press this key here.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.600
Right.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.760
Oh, and only blow up the houses
on the left-hand side of the road,

11:27.840 --> 11:29.720
-not the houses on the right.
-Gotcha.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.360
-[laptop beeps]
-[rocket sounds]

11:32.440 --> 11:34.200
-Direct hit!
-[laptop beeps]

11:34.280 --> 11:36.160
-[rocket sounds]
-[Toast] And another.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.680
I'm very good at this
if I don't mind saying.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.760
-[rocket sounds]
-Oh... Hope there was nobody home!

11:42.840 --> 11:43.960
Having fun?

11:44.040 --> 11:46.400
-Yes, it's quite addictive, isn't it?
-Mmm.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.040
-[laptop beeps]
-[rocket sounds]

11:48.120 --> 11:49.680
-[Mrs. Purchase] Oh.
-What?

11:50.200 --> 11:52.880
Did I say blow up the houses
on the left-hand side?

11:52.960 --> 11:54.360
Yes.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.200
I meant the houses on the right.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.880
Well, I've blown a hell of a lot up
on the left.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.120
Oh... Well, it'll probably be fine.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.560
-I imagine no one'll notice.
-No.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.080
-Oh!
-[they laugh]

12:12.160 --> 12:14.920
Which one of you lads is looking
for a sex change? You, is it?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.480
-No.
-It's me, actually.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.720
What's your budget?
How much do you wanna spend on it?

12:20.800 --> 12:22.640
It's quite serious,
a sex change operation.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.680
It's not the type of thing
you can cut corners on.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.000
So, what are you looking at?

12:26.720 --> 12:30.360
Well, I got a quote from an established,
specialist surgeon. £4,000.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.960
Jesus! £4,000 for a sex change?

12:34.040 --> 12:36.400
I do more or less
the same thing for 50 quid.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.600
-Fifty quid?
-All I need is a level surface

12:38.680 --> 12:40.040
and a bucket for drainage.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.400
And I'll throw in for free
disposal of body parts.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.120
Right, well, as I say,
it's quite a big operation,

12:45.200 --> 12:47.080
so I need to know everything's
all above board.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.320
-There's a full guarantee going with it.
-Oh.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.680
Fifty quid, no hidden charges.

12:50.760 --> 12:54.160
Honestly, you'd be mad
to spend £4,000 on a sex change.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.600
All those twisters in Harley Street
ripping off naive transgenders.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.920
For that amount of cash,
we could change you into a llama.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.120
Are you serious? A full sex change
operation for 50 quid?

13:05.200 --> 13:08.880
Yeah. [laughs] Unless you want to pay
the VAT on top of it? [laughs]

13:09.520 --> 13:11.160
[sighs]

13:11.240 --> 13:17.320
All right. OK. Yes! [laughs]
Hope I don't live to regret this! [laughs]

13:17.400 --> 13:18.440
Can we start now?

13:24.280 --> 13:25.360
How are you feeling, Danny?

13:25.440 --> 13:28.680
-Well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.
-Never had a sex change operation before?

13:28.760 --> 13:31.920
-Uh, no.
-Ah, you've nothing to worry about.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.320
So, what's in this plastic bag?

13:38.400 --> 13:41.080
-A pair of tits.
-Ah, yes... Very interesting.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.560
-What are you doing here?
-I'm the intermediary, Larry.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.640
Instrumental in bringing
both parties together.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.200
Do you mind if I stay and watch?

13:49.800 --> 13:52.840
-It'll cost you a tenner.
-OK.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.440
Look, I'm really not sure about all this.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.480
-Having cold feet, Danny?
-You should've said something before now,

13:58.560 --> 14:00.320
instead of leaving it to Muggins
to sort out!

14:00.400 --> 14:02.160
-I think I'll give it a miss.
-What?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.640
The operation. I'll give it a miss.

14:03.720 --> 14:07.000
Because you don't want to lose the
moustache? We could probably keep that.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.440
That Eurovision winner looked great.
She had a full beard.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.160
Sorry, I've changed my mind.
I went for a budget option

14:13.240 --> 14:15.840
and I should have gone
for a more traditional medical route,

14:15.920 --> 14:19.240
like, with a proper surgeon
and you know, hospital.

14:19.320 --> 14:22.440
Well, it's no skin off my nose,
but I'm gonna have to keep the 50 squid.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.520
-Yep. OK, fine.
-You can keep the pair of tits.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.440
-I don't think I'm gonna need them now.
-[Ed] Uh...

14:27.520 --> 14:28.640
Can I have them?

14:28.720 --> 14:29.720
[scoffs]

14:38.040 --> 14:39.360
Ah...

14:39.440 --> 14:41.320
[chuckles]

14:43.040 --> 14:44.520
[exhales] Enjoying yourself, Ed?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.560
Yes.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.880
Yes. So,

14:49.960 --> 14:51.880
the Royal Variety Performance, huh?

14:51.960 --> 14:54.280
I'm looking forward to it
and I'll tune in. Are you nervous?

14:54.360 --> 14:57.280
Nah, who cares? It's a charity event.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.360
All I know is that when Kevin Spacey
sees my sand dance,

15:00.440 --> 15:04.480
he'll be so impressed, he's bound
to offer me the  House of Cards  attaché.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.240
-Best of luck with that.
-Downside is, I have to share the stage

15:07.320 --> 15:08.840
with Ray bloody Purchase again.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.320
I hope he doesn't fall through
the trap door this time.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.840
[laughs] Yes.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.400
Did you manage
to look at those plastic tits?

15:15.480 --> 15:18.120
Yes, yes, I did.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.960
You see, I don't know how Muggins
would have grafted these onto your friend

15:22.040 --> 15:24.200
without a severe risk of blood poisoning.

15:24.280 --> 15:28.040
Paul Gascoigne used to wear these
the whole time. It's very disappointing.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.880
Well, what the hell were you expecting?

15:30.960 --> 15:33.480
Oh, I dunno. Something a bit less tacky.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.880
Something a bit more,
you know, va-va-voom.

15:35.960 --> 15:39.680
[scoffs] You are very peculiar, Ed.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.040
-You can have them if you want.
-I don't want them.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.840
-Unless...
-[Ed] Unless what?

15:45.920 --> 15:49.960
Well, Tom Jones has just been added to
the bill at the Royal Variety Performance.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.000
A pair of plastic tits may be
just the kind of thing he'd like.

15:53.080 --> 15:57.600
Yes, good thinking! Tom Jones
would love a pair of comedy plastic tits.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.400
I think he would.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.480
Right, I'm off.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.680
If I were you, I'd find another lodger,

16:03.760 --> 16:08.000

Talking of old ones, fellas.

-What did you get Charles and Camilla?

19:34.680 --> 19:37.160
You were supposed
to get them a gift, remember?

-Oh, shit!
-[sighs]

19:39.160 --> 19:41.680
You forgot, didn't you? You bloody idiot!

19:41.760 --> 19:45.040
Well done, Toast.
Terrific work, very moving.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.520
I got a real sense of Egypt.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.880
Did you see Spacey?

19:48.960 --> 19:50.560
Yes, he was in the middle
of the front row.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.280
I was sitting right behind him.
He was clapping all the way through.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.000
[chuckles] Hollywood, here I come!

19:56.760 --> 19:57.840
[Bob] Ah, Toast.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.360
The royal couple are almost here.
Did you get them a present?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.280
I hope you didn't forget.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.640
He did forget
because he's a complete cunt!

20:04.720 --> 20:06.680
-Mind the language, Purchase.
-Sorry, Bob.

20:06.760 --> 20:10.320
This is bloody serious, Toast.
Sometimes the joking has to stop.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.120
Ah, Your Royal Highnesses,

20:12.200 --> 20:14.200
-this is Steven Toast...
-[Charles] Toast.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.440
He has a gift for you,
which he'd like to present

20:16.520 --> 20:19.280
on behalf of the friends
of the Regency Theatre.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.240
A pair of tits.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.520
-A pair of tits?
-They're not real tits, though.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.720
They're just plastic ones,
like Paul Gascoigne used to wear.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.040
[man coughs]

20:50.960 --> 20:52.840
Uh, a man went to the doctor
for a check-up.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.080
The doctor says, "I have some
very bad news, you're going to die."

20:56.160 --> 20:58.280
-God.
-The man says, "How long am I gonna live?"

20:58.360 --> 21:02.200
The doctor said, "Ten..."
The man said, "What, months, weeks?"

21:02.280 --> 21:05.640
The doctor said, "No. Nine, eight..."

Toast!

21:10.400 --> 21:11.840
Ha!

21:13.720 --> 21:17.360
Oh, whose are these?
Bloody hilarious man.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.680
What do you think, Charlie? [laughs]

21:22.400 --> 21:26.200
Very unwise of you, Toast,
to open that trap door.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.520
Bob is dead, rather like his zombie wife.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.400
So is Bob Monkhouse now a zombie?

21:31.480 --> 21:33.920
This is no time to discuss whether

21:34.000 --> 21:37.160
Bob Monkhouse is now a zombie
like his wife.

21:37.240 --> 21:41.600
You can kiss goodbye to any ideas
of an MBE or CBE after your name.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.960
DOA, more likely,
and as for a knighthood, ha!

21:45.040 --> 21:47.400
But Kevin Spacey. What about him?

21:47.480 --> 21:49.320
I mean, he loved my performance. Any word?

21:51.920 --> 21:53.840
Kevin Spacey, Jane!

21:53.920 --> 21:57.080
Oh, I may have made a slight error
on that one, Toast.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.680
Oh, God. What?

21:59.760 --> 22:03.040
Well, you know I said I was sitting
behind him in the theater?

22:03.120 --> 22:04.600
[Toast]  Yes, you were sat behind him

22:04.680 --> 22:06.400
while he was adoring my performance. And?

22:06.480 --> 22:08.840
[Jane]  Well, I presumed
it was Kevin Spacey,

22:08.920 --> 22:13.800
but I subsequently discovered
it was actually the comedian Bob Mortimer.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.280
-[Toast]  Who?
-[Jane]  Bob Mortimer?

22:16.360 --> 22:20.360
He does look very like Spacey,
especially from behind.

22:38.680 --> 22:39.920
Better?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.680
So, what the shit happened with Spacey?

22:42.760 --> 22:46.480
Well, apparently he went to Afghanistan,
on a humanitarian mission.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.840
Unlike you, he does
a lot of work for charity.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.960
So, he was visiting some good Afghans, who
live on the left-hand side of the road--

22:53.040 --> 22:55.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.200
As opposed to Afghans that live
on the right-hand side of the road?

22:59.280 --> 23:02.440
Oh, the bad Afghans live
on the right-hand side of the road.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.640
-I see.
-Anyway, nobody's heard from him in days.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.400
I do hope he turns up again.
