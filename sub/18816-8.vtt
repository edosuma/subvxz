00:02.600 --> 00:05.075
There is no us.

00:05.175 --> 00:08.150
I'm investigating the sinking
of a sloop called the Cornwallis.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.675
I want you to write an account naming

00:10.775 --> 00:13.525
Sir Stuart Strange
as the man who organised

00:13.625 --> 00:15.700
the loading with slaves.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.750
For the safe.

00:19.825 --> 00:22.100
You witnessed the division
of the gunpowder

00:22.200 --> 00:24.425
and you heard its destination?

00:24.525 --> 00:27.925
On direct instruction
of James Delaney himself, sir.

00:28.025 --> 00:32.725
We have Delaney, we have Nootka,
we have the China trade.

00:32.825 --> 00:35.250
They will walk you along a tightrope.

00:35.350 --> 00:37.700
A line between life and death.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.275
I will give you all the information
that you request.

00:40.375 --> 00:43.650
In return, I will need a single
meeting with Sir Stuart Strange.

00:43.750 --> 00:45.850
If your witness is Delaney,

00:45.950 --> 00:47.900
he is being held
in the Tower of London,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.750
charged with treason.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.875
No, I have another witness.

00:51.975 --> 00:54.125
When my ship is ready,
I will send for you.

00:54.225 --> 00:55.600
You don't have a bloody ship!

00:55.700 --> 00:57.475
Brace, I spoke to a witness.

00:57.575 --> 00:58.875
It wasn't James that killed the girl,

00:58.975 --> 01:00.275
it was the East India Company.

01:00.375 --> 01:01.750
I need to tell James.

01:01.850 --> 01:03.350
- They've got him.
- Where is he?

01:03.450 --> 01:05.175
They took him to the Tower.

01:05.275 --> 01:08.975
- I'm here.
- I have a use for you.

[Bell tolls]

03:08.600 --> 03:11.350
In those days, I always chose boys...

03:11.450 --> 03:14.000
who had the shadow of death on them.

03:14.100 --> 03:17.275
I thought they would be
less likely to return.

03:17.375 --> 03:20.050
Of course, they do return...

03:21.225 --> 03:24.175
as ghosts.

03:24.275 --> 03:26.725
- Now I'm older--
- How many boys?

03:28.775 --> 03:34.725
How many Company boys did you
send to crew your private ships?

03:34.825 --> 03:39.150
Please, don't believe that I will
say anything to confirm or deny

03:39.250 --> 03:42.950
any action past, present or future,

03:43.050 --> 03:46.650
in any regard
whatsoever to this business.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.250
But the point is, you see...

03:56.950 --> 03:59.375
You didn't die, did you?

04:00.725 --> 04:04.625
Not even over there,
where everyone dies.

04:08.850 --> 04:10.050
No.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.375
No, I did not.

04:16.050 --> 04:18.450
I was rescued by an African...

04:20.350 --> 04:21.575
who saved me...

04:22.800 --> 04:24.450
and he cured me...

04:26.500 --> 04:28.250
and he showed me to myself.

04:33.650 --> 04:37.850
The things I did in Africa
make your transactions look paltry.

04:41.900 --> 04:47.350
I witnessed and participated in
darkness that you cannot conceive.

04:50.550 --> 04:53.625
And will you be including
that in your account

04:53.725 --> 04:54.900
to the Royal Commission?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.225
No.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.725
Luckily, I'm not being
tried for that today.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.375
Oh. [Chuckles]

05:14.550 --> 05:19.575
- They serve good hock to traitors.
- Perhaps you'll be served the same.

05:27.150 --> 05:31.950
I understand you asked poor,
sweet Godfrey...

05:32.050 --> 05:34.525
- to write an account, too.
- Hmm.

05:41.275 --> 05:44.375
I assume you want to make
some sort of a deal?

06:05.525 --> 06:07.775
Is this the extent of your ambition?

06:12.200 --> 06:15.100
It is in return for my silence,

06:15.200 --> 06:17.300
and for Godfrey to burn his account.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.625
No.

06:21.725 --> 06:23.250
I can't deliver that.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.250
Then you had better
get used to the taste.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.425
I'm working on this, here.

06:34.525 --> 06:37.425
"When the Cornwallis left Cabinda

06:37.525 --> 06:39.850
and became the Influence,

06:39.950 --> 06:43.350
it was I, James Delaney,

06:43.450 --> 06:46.850
who stowed the
Jack and Company flags."

06:48.300 --> 06:49.775
Tut, tut, tut.

06:49.875 --> 06:54.775
"An East India ship, renamed,

06:54.875 --> 06:58.900
laden with illegal slaves

06:59.000 --> 07:01.975
and flying the Stars and Stripes...

07:06.400 --> 07:09.775
at the direct request
of Sir Stuart Strange."

07:12.150 --> 07:14.025
That's treason.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.350
One living witness.

07:21.450 --> 07:24.575
In one hour, I will be interviewed
by the King's private secretary,

07:24.675 --> 07:26.975
three attorneys
and half a dozen clerks.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.350
They will want it in writing.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.350
Hmm?

07:32.450 --> 07:38.225
And at midday,
Godfrey, poor, sweet Godfrey...

07:39.875 --> 07:42.300
he will deliver his own account
to the Royal Commission,

07:42.400 --> 07:45.350
confirming how you concealed

07:45.450 --> 07:48.325
your ownership of this ship

07:48.425 --> 07:50.575
and its cargo...

07:53.750 --> 07:55.175
by committing treason.

07:58.950 --> 08:01.600
So that's one living witness

08:01.700 --> 08:04.575
and one account from
an East India Company clerk,

08:04.675 --> 08:08.975
prepared to give information
heard under a raised hand.

08:20.925 --> 08:22.125
Keep it.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.625
I remember it all.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.500
I need a ship.

08:33.725 --> 08:36.150
You have four hours.

08:40.825 --> 08:43.299
[Bell tolls]

08:45.550 --> 08:47.125
Brace? I'm going out.

08:48.325 --> 08:50.100
I need to see someone.

09:03.025 --> 09:04.775
From Mr. Delaney.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.950
[Snoring]

09:20.050 --> 09:22.700
- [Hurried footsteps]
- Mr. Cholmondeley!

09:22.800 --> 09:26.650
Mr. Cholmondeley!

09:31.125 --> 09:35.050
I have a message for you, sir,
from Mr. Delaney.

09:38.075 --> 09:40.175
How the hell did he find me?

09:40.275 --> 09:43.225
Just humour me.
I'm a scientist, so I'm curious.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.925
He sees me in my dreams.

09:48.150 --> 09:49.625
Is that it?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.625
I just deliver messages, sir.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.100
Atticus!

10:11.850 --> 10:13.050
Good boy.

10:15.225 --> 10:16.950
Wilton!

10:17.050 --> 10:18.225
Pettifer!

10:22.725 --> 10:24.375
Ah, fuck it!

10:31.725 --> 10:34.050
[Hurried footsteps]

10:34.725 --> 10:38.900
Gentlemen,
there are things I need you to do.

10:43.275 --> 10:44.550
Are you going to teach me, then?

10:44.650 --> 10:46.650
Yeah, go on, go on, hit the ball.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.375
[She giggles]

10:50.675 --> 10:52.425
Swing for it, then.

10:52.525 --> 10:54.775
You're not holding it tight enough!

10:59.100 --> 11:00.300
Where's the other one?

11:00.400 --> 11:03.375
- Sorry, sir.
- She don't speak, she's in mourning.

11:03.475 --> 11:04.700
Fetch her.

11:06.050 --> 11:07.875
I've had a coach drawn up.

11:07.975 --> 11:10.625
You ladies are going
on a tour of the grounds.

11:11.550 --> 11:13.725
At the point of a bayonet,
if necessary.

11:13.825 --> 11:15.250
Bring her!

11:16.200 --> 11:17.600
Come on!

11:17.700 --> 11:20.650
I want to know where you're taking us.

11:20.750 --> 11:21.775
In.

11:28.150 --> 11:29.650
Go!

11:38.750 --> 11:41.575
[James speaks other language]

12:10.750 --> 12:12.575
Tell them that I'm not ready.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.175
I need to see a doctor.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.975
Watch him!

12:38.325 --> 12:40.625
Mr. Delaney is
in need of a doctor, sir.

12:42.550 --> 12:43.900
He must be bluffing.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.825
Or has he fallen off the tightrope?

12:53.275 --> 12:55.350
Well, you go
and bring the doctor, then.

12:57.100 --> 13:01.225
And we can all pray to God that we
haven't completely fried his brain.

13:14.875 --> 13:16.100
Hold up!

13:19.250 --> 13:22.625
Out! The rest of you, out now!

13:26.425 --> 13:29.550
These gentlemen
are actually here to rescue you.

13:29.650 --> 13:31.025
Atticus?

13:31.125 --> 13:34.100
If it was down to me,
you'd have been dead long ago.

13:34.950 --> 13:37.275
Delaney orders
you shouldn't be harmed.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.450
There's still plenty of cocks
left for you to suck.

13:39.550 --> 13:42.450
The agreement is that you take
the ladies away in the coach

13:42.550 --> 13:46.425
and I walk back to the house
and report that they were kidnapped.

13:46.525 --> 13:50.750
In truth, your beloved child
was killed for a greater purpose.

13:53.550 --> 13:55.575
Isn't that right, Mr. Pettifer?

13:57.650 --> 14:00.950
There is an agreement in place
between my master and yours.

14:02.750 --> 14:03.950
Indeed there is.

14:04.950 --> 14:06.825
[Horse neighs, women gasp]

14:08.075 --> 14:09.375
Get in.

14:17.525 --> 14:18.900
Drive on!

14:26.875 --> 14:28.800
[Door opens]

14:28.900 --> 14:31.550
A brig called the Good Hope.

14:31.650 --> 14:33.625
It is fitted out for a voyage
to Constantinople

14:33.725 --> 14:36.375
and is set to leave tomorrow
on the ebb.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.225
- Is it yet loaded?
- No.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.125
Draw up papers to have it diverted.

14:44.225 --> 14:47.475
Have it rowed to Wapping Wall
by a skeleton crew.

14:47.575 --> 14:50.575
It's to be tied up,
with only provisions onboard.

14:51.475 --> 14:55.775
Enough for a crew of 15 for a...

14:55.875 --> 14:57.100
two-month journey.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.975
- For what reason, sir?
- Hm?

15:00.350 --> 15:01.375
What I mean is,

15:01.475 --> 15:04.325
what is the official reason
I should give in the daybook?

15:04.425 --> 15:07.875
The official reason.
Well, let's see...

15:07.975 --> 15:10.525
"The Good Hope
was taken to Wapping Wall

15:10.625 --> 15:12.950
for an unannounced
inspection of its hull

15:13.050 --> 15:14.700
for short measure of tar,

15:14.800 --> 15:16.675
in case of fraudulent accounting

15:16.775 --> 15:18.800
by the ship fitters,
Master and Preece."

15:18.900 --> 15:21.100
Hmm? Put that in the daybook.

15:22.725 --> 15:26.250
And what is the official reason
for sending two Company dray carts

15:26.350 --> 15:28.250
to Bedlam Insane Asylum?

15:30.475 --> 15:33.900
Because this whole thing is insane.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.375
Because this day is insane,
because Delaney is insane!

15:38.325 --> 15:40.125
Because I am insane!

15:41.625 --> 15:42.900
Just do it.

15:44.150 --> 15:46.400
Should we await Mr. Pettifer's return?

15:46.500 --> 15:49.375
No, we should not await
Mr. Pettifer's return.

15:53.350 --> 15:54.925
Just fuck off, will you?

16:21.675 --> 16:23.500
Come on, out.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.925
We need to burn this.

16:26.025 --> 16:27.525
Atticus, I want an explanation.

16:27.625 --> 16:28.650
Helga, get in!

16:28.750 --> 16:30.025
Come on!

16:36.975 --> 16:39.450
It's all right.
You've nothing to fear.

16:42.525 --> 16:44.100
What?

16:44.200 --> 16:46.625
Temple was on the foreshore.

16:46.725 --> 16:51.450
He saw James sleeping in the mud
and Winter lay down beside him.

16:51.550 --> 16:53.625
He then saw a man arrive in a boat.

16:54.425 --> 16:56.575
"Moving like a ghost," wasn't he?

16:58.475 --> 17:01.875
It was this ghost that killed
your Winter, as she slept.

17:01.975 --> 17:03.900
The man then got back in the boat,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.500
Temple followed him
along the foreshore,

17:05.599 --> 17:08.724
where he was met by someone
on the other side.

17:08.825 --> 17:11.224
They were in a carriage,

17:11.325 --> 17:13.375
like the one you just came out of.

17:15.175 --> 17:17.125
The East India Company?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.900
Is that the truth, little boy?

17:23.750 --> 17:26.200
You know what happens
to little boys that lie, don't you?

17:26.300 --> 17:27.849
I swear, it's the truth.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.450
James is offering you a new start.

17:42.625 --> 17:43.775
So, James.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.700
Things that go bang.

18:18.300 --> 18:21.650
There.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.325
Things that cause confusion.

18:44.275 --> 18:46.875
His Majesty's representatives
want to know how much longer.

18:46.975 --> 18:48.750
Another half an hour, at least.

18:51.950 --> 18:53.325
[Door slams]

18:55.075 --> 18:57.800
I swear to God,
he was beaten half to death

18:57.900 --> 19:00.225
before he yelped, "Enough!"

19:00.325 --> 19:02.625
Why do so many of them
choose to be beaten?

19:02.725 --> 19:06.375
Power. One told me it's like pissing.

19:06.475 --> 19:08.175
You build up the power
inside your belly

19:08.275 --> 19:10.500
and then you need to let it out,

19:10.600 --> 19:13.975
and a good thrashing from a Countess
does the trick, apparently.

19:15.450 --> 19:16.975
Full house.

19:17.075 --> 19:20.650
Shall we refer
our opinions to Dr. Gin?

19:22.075 --> 19:23.950
[Whispers]: Who on earth is that?

19:24.050 --> 19:26.100
Countess?

19:26.200 --> 19:28.150
I thought you'd be alone.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.250
Well, as you can see, I am not.
What do you want?

19:31.350 --> 19:33.950
Well, I believe we have
an appointment.

19:34.050 --> 19:37.325
My only appointment
is with intoxication.

19:37.425 --> 19:40.025
As you may recall,
I represent a company which produces

19:40.125 --> 19:43.675
products which restore
and enhance female beauty.

19:43.775 --> 19:47.100
And also a certain feminine product,

19:47.200 --> 19:49.450
which you may prefer
to discuss in private.

19:49.550 --> 19:51.025
I don't recall.

19:51.125 --> 19:54.100
Pixie, perhaps as well as medicine
for your poor, worn-out chuff,

19:54.200 --> 19:57.450
the lady may have something
to repair a faulty memory.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.800
Do you have a beauty product
which would bag me an admiral?

20:00.900 --> 20:04.250
I have a product which would allow you
to accommodate an entire fleet,

20:04.350 --> 20:07.425
without discomfort,
admiral and rear admiral.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.225
My products include paints and oils,

20:11.325 --> 20:14.250
but in particular powder.

20:16.875 --> 20:20.450
And for those of us who have
secrets, marks, blemishes--

20:21.725 --> 20:24.450
We have ways of
preserving those secrets.

20:24.550 --> 20:28.125
Those who use it
will do almost anything for it,

20:28.225 --> 20:30.900
when their supply is exhausted.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.700
The name of the powder is Collonade.

20:36.325 --> 20:37.650
And you have samples?

20:37.750 --> 20:40.250
Indeed. Perhaps I could show you
in person how to apply it

20:40.350 --> 20:41.550
for best advantage?

20:41.650 --> 20:45.575
Ladies, I will be back
before the sandwiches.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.250

Coming to my house

21:02.150 --> 21:03.150
I work for James Delaney.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.375
- He's in the Tower.
- Not for long.

21:05.475 --> 21:06.700
He sails today.

21:07.550 --> 21:10.150
And he requires the letter
for safe passage,

21:10.250 --> 21:11.925

21:13.325 --> 21:15.225
And I get the Treaty in return?

21:16.350 --> 21:17.725
No.

21:17.825 --> 21:21.875
You see, there's a letter
which we will send to Solomon Coop,

and intoxicate

21:24.450 --> 21:26.500

21:28.050 --> 21:30.950
If I fail to return,
it will be delivered by midday.

21:32.350 --> 21:36.850
James Delaney
also says to tell Collonade

21:36.950 --> 21:39.325
that you do, indeed,
have a leaky ship.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.825
But he's found the leak
and will fix it,

Move! Come on, shift your arse!
Get it loaded now!

40:34.650 --> 40:36.425
Oi! Get it loaded!

40:37.375 --> 40:40.575
How is your religion these days, Coop?

40:40.675 --> 40:41.850
My what?

40:41.950 --> 40:43.250
Your religion, your faith.

40:43.350 --> 40:44.850
After many years in your service,

40:44.950 --> 40:47.975
it is in rags and tatters,
Your Highness.

40:48.075 --> 40:50.650
And have you spoken
about all this with God?

40:50.750 --> 40:52.450
Well, I discuss things...

40:54.250 --> 40:56.325
with my wife, in bed.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.575
Oh.

40:58.675 --> 41:00.650
I talk to God.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.350
I spoke to Him just now.

41:02.450 --> 41:04.950
And what did God say?

41:05.050 --> 41:08.050
Conversations between monarchs
and God are private,

41:08.150 --> 41:10.650
but I will give you the gist of it.

41:10.750 --> 41:14.225
Due to this monumental balls-up,

41:14.325 --> 41:16.575
everyone must hang.

41:16.675 --> 41:20.925
East India, Americans,
Irish, French...

41:21.025 --> 41:24.625
- Dogs, cats, rabbits. Why not?
- Your Highness...

41:24.725 --> 41:27.375
- Priests, clerks, fitters...
- There is little doubt in my mind...

41:27.475 --> 41:30.125
that senior directors at the East India
have done a deal with Delaney.

41:30.225 --> 41:32.125
Just fucking kill him!

41:32.225 --> 41:35.750
If he dies, then Nootka goes
to the Americans, as per his will.

41:35.850 --> 41:37.450
Fuck Nootka!

41:37.550 --> 41:40.425
Fuck wills! Fuck treaties!

41:40.525 --> 41:42.425
I'm the head of fucking state!

41:43.875 --> 41:45.850
And by the command of His Majesty...

41:48.050 --> 41:49.650
kill him.

41:55.300 --> 41:56.775
Mary, Mary, out of the way!

42:00.075 --> 42:02.125
Where are you keeping everyone?

42:04.525 --> 42:05.725
In there.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.550
Right.

42:17.350 --> 42:19.100
You good?

42:19.200 --> 42:21.225
15 minutes until high tide.

42:38.250 --> 42:39.575
So, charges?

42:39.675 --> 42:40.950
Yeah, yeah, the chemist.

42:41.050 --> 42:42.775
He's a nightmare.

42:42.875 --> 42:44.900
Cole will kill him with his own cock,
if he's not shot today.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.325
- Can't kill him.
- Why?

42:46.425 --> 42:47.950
We need him.

42:48.050 --> 42:49.425
He's a doctor.

42:50.300 --> 42:52.625
Is the powder on the ship?

42:52.725 --> 42:56.750
55 kegs onboard, 15 on the dock
and two in the water.

42:56.850 --> 42:59.150
Right. Well, when we are 60 and ten,

42:59.250 --> 43:01.600
I need you to take the pilgrims
and put them on the ship

43:01.700 --> 43:03.150
before the ebb.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.900
Where are you going?

43:05.450 --> 43:06.675
To explain the plans.

43:06.775 --> 43:08.325
I don't want you
to tell them the plans.

43:08.425 --> 43:10.375
Besides, you're not coming.

43:11.800 --> 43:13.600
What?

43:13.700 --> 43:17.825
Brace, you have always been
my father's man, in my father's world.

43:17.925 --> 43:19.975
We're headed to my mother's now.

43:20.850 --> 43:24.100
James, tell me this, too, is mercy.

43:24.925 --> 43:27.225
I'm an old man, I would never survive.

43:29.900 --> 43:31.500
Tell me that's the reason.

43:36.175 --> 43:38.475
Brace, you were not born for freedom.

43:40.650 --> 43:43.875
You wouldn't know what to do with it.

43:43.975 --> 43:45.625
It would torture you.

43:46.600 --> 43:47.900
Now, go home.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.700
Everything belongs to you now.

43:54.025 --> 43:55.025
The soldiers are here!

43:55.125 --> 43:56.925
Atticus! Bill!

43:57.025 --> 43:59.700
Right, Robert, get down there,
tell them to hurry up with that cargo.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.025
Quick!

44:01.125 --> 44:03.500
Keep moving, all of you. Fast!

44:03.600 --> 44:05.950
All right, you lot,
you heard him-- Move!

44:06.050 --> 44:08.125
The soldiers are coming. Hurry up!

44:08.225 --> 44:09.900
Come on, chop chop, let's go!

45:05.725 --> 45:07.700
[Screaming]

45:20.050 --> 45:22.750
[Groaning and coughing]

45:47.975 --> 45:49.575
Men, regroup!

46:03.100 --> 46:05.225
[Ticking]

46:15.450 --> 46:16.950
Tide's about to turn, James.

46:17.050 --> 46:19.400
Go and get them,
put them on the ship now. Move it.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.625
[Soldiers scream]

46:24.525 --> 46:25.750
Not yet!

46:38.250 --> 46:40.875
Everybody out! Come on! Move!

47:03.300 --> 47:04.700
Come on, now.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.375
Move, move!

47:07.225 --> 47:09.175
Get on there, quick. Come on.

47:10.250 --> 47:11.875
Wait. Leave it! Leave it!

47:13.400 --> 47:15.150
Helga!

47:15.250 --> 47:16.950
Get in! Go, go!

47:56.500 --> 47:58.150
Argh!

48:12.400 --> 48:15.075
Bill! Bill!

48:24.925 --> 48:27.975
Fuck!

48:44.600 --> 48:46.700
[Whispers]: How many?

48:59.400 --> 49:00.900
Bill!

49:59.975 --> 50:01.175
Fuck.

50:04.725 --> 50:06.625
Sir.

50:10.100 --> 50:12.575
Aha, my final ace.

50:14.125 --> 50:16.475
Still no word from Wilton
or Pettifer, sir.

50:16.575 --> 50:20.000
Ah. Perhaps they left early
for the weekend.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.575
As will I, I think.

50:22.975 --> 50:24.550
How did this get here?

50:24.650 --> 50:27.625
Some errand boy delivered it,
sir, from a Dr. Dumbarton.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.800
Said you'd be expecting it?

50:29.900 --> 50:31.275
Tea, I think.

50:32.525 --> 50:35.000
- Tea, sir?
- Yes.

50:35.100 --> 50:37.225
All the tea in China,

50:37.325 --> 50:40.150
and a strip of land
at the arse of a pig.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.625
And an end to this business, at last.

51:05.500 --> 51:06.975
Hello?

51:23.725 --> 51:26.100
Forgive me, the door was open.

51:28.850 --> 51:30.625
I just received a note.

51:36.450 --> 51:38.475
Mr. Delaney said
he had left his account

51:38.575 --> 51:40.800
of the sinking of the Cornwallis

51:40.900 --> 51:44.025
and the account
of the East India clerk, Godfrey.

51:46.900 --> 51:48.975
It said I would find it in his room.

51:51.975 --> 51:53.375
Which one is his room?

51:55.775 --> 51:57.175
His room is the attic.

52:00.300 --> 52:02.275
The one looking out to the river.

52:20.175 --> 52:23.050
Hey. [Chuckles]

53:09.050 --> 53:10.275
Justice.

54:22.725 --> 54:23.950
Maria?

54:27.100 --> 54:28.750
Yes.

54:28.850 --> 54:33.100
You always had such beautiful fingers.

54:33.200 --> 54:34.950
Maria?

54:35.050 --> 54:36.275
Yes?

54:38.975 --> 54:40.900
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

54:43.975 --> 54:45.600
I'm sorry.

54:45.700 --> 54:46.900
You are forgiven.

54:50.125 --> 54:51.375
[Whispers]: Thank you.

54:55.300 --> 54:57.575
- Take the helm.
- Aye aye.

55:09.100 --> 55:10.500
She's a good old girl.

55:11.375 --> 55:12.825
Hmm.

55:12.925 --> 55:14.175
America, then?

55:16.525 --> 55:17.750
No.

55:18.575 --> 55:20.425
Ponta Delgada in the Azores.

55:22.100 --> 55:24.175
I need to see a man called Collonade.

55:26.175 --> 55:29.400
I thought the gunpowder
was for the Americans.

55:29.500 --> 55:31.575
We are Americans.
