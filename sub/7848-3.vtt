GLOSS ME.

00:18.734 --> 00:20.834
SORRY. WE'RE WATCHING
THE COUNTER FOR MADDIE.

00:20.834 --> 00:26.300
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO ACCEPT MONEY, MAKE CHANGE,
OR TOUCH ANY OF THE MERCHANDISE.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.300
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO?

00:28.300 --> 00:32.500
I CAN SHOVE 12
GUMMI WORMS UP MY NOSE.
YOU WANNA SEE?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.467
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

01:03.867 --> 01:06.600
SO, DO YOU COME TO
THE TIPTON HOTEL OFTEN?

01:06.600 --> 01:08.934
IT'S LIKE I LIVE HERE.

01:08.934 --> 01:11.500
SO, KYLE, YOU IN TOWN

01:11.500 --> 01:15.200

01:15.200 --> 01:16.600
THEN WE FLY TO BERMUDA.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.600
OUR MOMS LOST THEIR TANS
SKIING.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.367
OH...I HATE
WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

01:22.367 --> 01:27.200
WELL, AS WE SAY, GOTTA JET.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.500
YOU DON'T REALLY
LIKE THAT GUY, DO YOU?

01:29.500 --> 01:32.700
HE'S CUTE, BUT I'VE
WORKED HERE LONG ENOUGH
TO KNOW HIS TYPE.

01:32.700 --> 01:36.200
RICH PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYTHING BUT THEMSELVES.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.600
WHOA, HEY, MAN,

01:47.734 --> 01:48.467
SINCE WHEN?

01:48.467 --> 01:49.734
SINCE MY FATHER
BOUGHT OREGON

01:49.734 --> 01:53.000
AND STARTED
CHOPPING DOWN THE TREES.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.500

01:54.500 --> 01:56.500
THE CENTER OF ALL EVIL?

01:56.500 --> 01:57.767
THAT'S DAD.

01:57.767 --> 01:59.600
I PROTEST AGAINST THEM.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.300
ME, TOO.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.033
I GOT DRAGGED OFF BY A COP.

02:02.033 --> 02:05.233

HI.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.934

03:06.934 --> 03:08.667
SHE'S ALL HE COULD

03:08.667 --> 03:11.934
OH, PLEASE.
THEY ARE SO NOT RIGHT
FOR EACH OTHER.

03:11.934 --> 03:14.700
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE BOTH RICH.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.767
WHAT? OH, HE THOUGHT--

03:16.767 --> 03:19.700
HA! I DON'T WANNA BURST
ANY BUBBLES,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.000
BUT IT'S SO MUCH FUN.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.500
♪ LONDON, A WORD ♪

03:25.133 --> 03:28.300
I COULDN'T HELP

OH, GOOD. THEN YOU'LL
HAVE THE HOTEL LIMO
READY BY 8:00?

03:31.400 --> 03:35.834
LOVE TO, EXCEPT
YOUR FATHER SAW THIS...

03:36.300 --> 03:40.467
AND MEMOED ME,
"NO MORE OF THESE."

03:40.467 --> 03:42.667
BUT--BUT--
NO "BUTS."

03:42.667 --> 03:44.600
IT IS UNSEEMLY
THAT A GIRL YOUR AGE

03:44.600 --> 03:47.100
BE OUT ALONE WITH 2 BOYS.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.734
BUT...

03:48.734 --> 03:50.567
I'M NOT GOING ALONE.

03:50.567 --> 03:51.700
MADDIE'S COMING.

03:51.700 --> 03:56.233
AND NOBODY'S GONNA
HAVE ANY REAL FUN
WITH MADDIE AROUND.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.233
GOOD POINT.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.367
EXCUSE ME.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:03.200 --> 04:06.900
I'M INVITING YOU
TO SEE USHER WITH ME,
KYLE, AND JASON.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.400
WHY?

04:08.400 --> 04:11.400
BECAUSE I'M NICE, DUH.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.200
OK. MOSEBY
WON'T LET ME GO

04:13.200 --> 04:17.300
UNLESS I BRING ALONG
A GUARANTEED KILLJOY.
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

04:17.300 --> 04:20.100
AS HEARTFELT
AS THAT OFFER IS,

04:20.100 --> 04:21.400
NO.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.133
OH, COME ON. KYLE
SAYS JASON LIKES YOU.

04:24.133 --> 04:28.033
REALLY? RICH GUYS
DON'T DATE POOR GIRLS.

04:28.033 --> 04:30.734
WHY WOULD JASON
WANNA GO OUT WITH ME?

04:30.734 --> 04:32.800
WELL, YOU'RE SMART AND CUTE,

04:32.800 --> 04:35.734
HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MIND
GIRLS WITH BIG FEET,

04:35.734 --> 04:36.834
AND HE THINKS YOU'RE RICH.

04:36.834 --> 04:40.467
NO WONDER HE'S
PAYING ATTENTION TO ME.

04:40.467 --> 04:41.934
I'LL GO
SET HIM STRAIGHT.

04:41.934 --> 04:44.767
NO. JUST PLAY ALONG.
PLEASE?

04:44.767 --> 04:46.667
IT'S ONLY FOR ONE NIGHT.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.567
FRONT-ROW SEATS.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.300
BACKSTAGE PASSES.

04:51.300 --> 04:56.900
YOU GET TO RIDE IN A LIMO
THAT'S NOT FOLLOWING A HEARSE.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.367
WE GET TO MEET USHER?

04:58.367 --> 05:02.233
SWEETIE,
USHER GETS TO MEET US.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.233
JUST CALL ME PRINCESS.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.834
THIS WHOLE NIGHT
HAS BEEN SO AWESOME.

05:09.834 --> 05:10.834
LOOK, I'M A VIP.

05:10.834 --> 05:15.200
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE AMAZING. IT'S LIKE
THIS IS ALL NEW TO YOU--

05:15.200 --> 05:18.834
FRONT-ROW SEATS,
MEETING CELEBRITIES,
RIDING IN LIMOS.

05:18.834 --> 05:19.734
YEAH, WELL,
I NEVER GET TIRED

05:19.734 --> 05:24.300
OF STICKING MY HEAD
OUT OF THE SUNROOF
AND YELLING, "WHOO!"

05:25.967 --> 05:27.867
DID YOU JUST HEAR SOMEBODY
GO, "WHOO"?

05:27.867 --> 05:30.600
IT MUST BE MADDIE.
GET DOWN.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.467
I HAVE AN IDEA. LET'S
ALL GO TO THE ROOFTOP,

05:34.467 --> 05:36.500
EXCEPT FOR MADDIE
AND JASON.

05:38.700 --> 05:42.667
SO, UH, I GUESS
I SHOULD SAY GOOD-BYE.

05:42.667 --> 05:47.000
OR YOU COULD INVITE ME
INTO YOUR SUITE.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.367
MY SUITE WHAT?

05:49.367 --> 05:53.000
OH, MY SUITE...
IN THE HOTEL
WHERE I LIVE

05:53.000 --> 05:54.033
BECAUSE I'M RICH.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.934
NO, YOU CAN'T COME IN.

05:55.934 --> 05:58.367
I THINK THAT CREEP'S
TRYING TO KISS HER.

05:58.367 --> 06:02.300
MAN, IF I WAS 5 YEARS OLDER
AND 2 FEET TALLER.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.700
I'D BE SQUASHED.

06:04.700 --> 06:08.967
SO YOU'RE LEAVING TOMORROW?
WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD...

06:08.967 --> 06:10.567
SHOULD
START KISSING NOW.

06:10.567 --> 06:12.233
BUT I HARDLY KNOW YOU.

06:12.233 --> 06:14.467
AS A GOOD-BYE KISS?

06:14.467 --> 06:16.500
OK, BYE.
BYE.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.100
Both: UNH.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.800
WHAT WAS THAT?

06:19.800 --> 06:21.734
CATS.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.100
B-B-BIG CATS.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.200
ACTUALLY, THEY'RE
THE HOTEL SINGER'S TWINS.

06:26.200 --> 06:30.033
WHEN SHE WORKS LATE,
I LET THEM STAY WITH ME.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.300
YOU ARE SO...

06:31.300 --> 06:32.967
YES, I AM.

06:32.967 --> 06:35.133
WELL, I BETTER GO.

06:35.133 --> 06:38.133
UH, NOT BEFORE
YOU SAY GOOD-BYE.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.600
THEY'RE KISSING GOOD-BYE.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.367
DIDN'T THEY JUST SAY GOOD-BYE?

06:50.767 --> 06:54.700
HEY, THANKS FOR LETTING ME
STAY THE NIGHT.
SURE, NO PROBLEM.

06:54.700 --> 06:59.467
SO, WORD ON THE STREET
IS THAT JASON'S
KIND OF CUTE.

06:59.467 --> 06:59.934
OH, BEYOND.

06:59.934 --> 07:04.100
AND HE THINKS I'M THE MOST
INTELLIGENT, BEAUTIFUL,
DOWN-TO-EARTH RICH GIRL

07:04.100 --> 07:05.367
HE'S EVER MET.

07:05.367 --> 07:06.934
OK, OK, WHOA.

07:06.934 --> 07:10.200
BACK UP. RICH?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.000
IT'S COMPLICATED?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.867
I WAS DOING LONDON
A FAVOR.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.300
IT'S NOT LIKE
I WANTED TO DO IT.

07:15.300 --> 07:20.000
OH, YEAH, MUST'VE BEEN TORTURE
TO HAVE TO KISS THAT BOY.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.967
CATS TOLD ME.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.400
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
TELL HIM THE TRUTH?

07:27.400 --> 07:29.200
NEVER. HE'S GONE.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.500
IT WAS ONLY
FOR ONE NIGHT,

07:30.500 --> 07:31.600
AND I'LL NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.033
MADDIE, CAN YOU
TAKE US TO THE PARK
ON YOUR WAY HOME?

07:35.033 --> 07:36.200
SURE. COME ON.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.900
DON'T BRING BACK
ANOTHER HOMELESS SQUIRREL.

07:39.900 --> 07:41.700
AW...
AW...

07:41.700 --> 07:44.400
[RING]

07:44.400 --> 07:45.367
HELLO?

07:45.367 --> 07:46.600
OH, NO.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.767
MADDIE, THESE ARE
MY PARENTS.
HI, HI.

07:49.767 --> 07:52.934
I, UH, THOUGHT
YOU'D BE ON YOUR WAY
TO BERMUDA BY NOW.

07:52.934 --> 07:58.100
WELL, SO DID WE.
BUT JASON INSISTED
ON ANOTHER NIGHT IN BOSTON.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.100
AND NOW I KNOW WHY.

07:59.100 --> 08:02.500
YEAH, JASON HAS SPOKEN
OF NOTHING BUT YOU

08:02.500 --> 08:05.300
ALL THE WAY FROM THE LOBBY
UP TO OUR ROOM.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.500
AND OUR ROOM IS ON
A VERY HIGH FLOOR.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.834
YOU CHECKING OUT?

08:10.834 --> 08:12.233
UM, UH...

08:12.233 --> 08:14.567
NO. SHE'S MOVING
TO THE TOP FLOOR,

08:14.567 --> 08:15.734
THE IMPERIAL SUITE.

08:15.734 --> 08:20.900
HER OLD SUITE
WAS THE WRONG SHADE
OF BEIGE.

08:21.233 --> 08:24.300
WELL, WE WERE
JUST COMING DOWN
TO INVITE YOU TO DINNER.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.767
I CONVINCED THEM TO TAKE US
TO CLUB NOUVEAU.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.700
REALLY? WOW.

08:28.700 --> 08:32.600
I CAN'T GO. YEAH, I PROMISED
I'D BABY-SIT THE BOYS TONIGHT.

08:32.600 --> 08:40.300
OH, YES, JASON TOLD US
ABOUT YOUR CHARITY WORK
WITH INDIGENT CHILDREN.

08:40.834 --> 08:42.667
CODY, HEY, JOSH CALLED.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.767
WE'RE SLEEPING OVER
AT HIS HOUSE TONIGHT.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.934
EXCELLENT.
NOW YOU CAN JOIN US.

08:46.934 --> 08:47.767
UH, UH...

08:47.767 --> 08:49.834
WE'RE ON THE TOP FLOOR
AS WELL. IN FACT,

08:49.834 --> 08:53.834
WE'LL PICK YOU UP.
7:00 SHARP.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.400
WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO?

09:06.400 --> 09:10.100
HERE'S A WILD THOUGHT.
TELL 'EM THE TRUTH.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.100
I DON'T THINK SO.
I MEAN,

09:11.100 --> 09:15.500
IF I TELL THEM NOW,
JASON WILL LOOK LIKE A FOOL,
AND I WILL LOOK LIKE--

09:15.500 --> 09:18.567
A LYING GOLD DIGGER?

09:20.400 --> 09:22.667
WHICH YOU'RE NOT.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.233
HOW AM I GONNA
GET OUT OF THIS?

09:25.233 --> 09:26.500
WE'LL HELP YOU
WITH JASON.

09:26.500 --> 09:31.400
WHY WOULD I HELP MY FUTURE WIFE
HOOK UP WITH SOME OTHER DUDE?

09:31.400 --> 09:35.500
BECAUSE HE'S LEAVING
TOMORROW, AND SHE'LL
OWE YOU BIG TIME.

09:35.500 --> 09:39.500
OK...HERE'S WHAT WE DO--

09:39.500 --> 09:42.734
FIRST, WE GET YOU
AN IMPERIAL SUITE.

09:42.734 --> 09:45.233
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH THEY COST?

09:45.233 --> 09:48.000
AW, SHE THOUGHT
WE'RE GONNA PAY.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.500
THAT'S SWEET.
NO, WE DON'T PAY, BABY.

09:55.500 --> 10:00.300
Zack: AND TO GET INTO
THE IMPERIAL SUITE,
YOU'LL NEED A KEYCARD.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.834
WHOA.

10:03.767 --> 10:07.000
[FEIGNS BEING HURT]

10:07.000 --> 10:11.667
OH, NO. I THINK
I HURT MY COCCYX.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.500
[GROANS]

10:15.500 --> 10:19.033
ALL BETTER NOW, THANK YOU.

10:19.033 --> 10:21.700
Maddie: BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO WEAR
TO CLUB NOUVEAU.

10:21.700 --> 10:24.133
Zack: PLEASE.
GIVE US A CHALLENGE.

10:24.133 --> 10:26.233
HEY, ESTEBAN,
MOSEBY'S YELLIN' FOR YA.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.300
FOR ME? HE NEVER
YELLS FOR ME.

10:28.300 --> 10:32.100
HE YELLS AT ME,
BUT ONLY WHEN I DESERVE IT,
WHICH IS OFTEN.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.133
HE'S A GREAT MAN.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.934
YOU'RE KEEPING
A GREAT MAN WAITING.

10:35.934 --> 10:37.600
YEAH. BUT THIS DRESS

21:49.500 --> 21:51.033
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN!

21:51.033 --> 21:52.767
CATCH YOU NEXT WEEK.

21:52.767 --> 21:56.133
THE TWIN TERRORS HAVE HIT
AT A FEVER HOLD.

21:56.133 --> 22:00.066
APPARENTLY,
NOT ASLEEP YET.
