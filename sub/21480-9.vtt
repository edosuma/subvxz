00:39.507 --> 00:42.007
we are not a threat.
we are salvation.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.308
the world will have to deal with us.

00:46.309 --> 00:47.909
previously on the 4400

00:47.910 --> 00:48.410
remember me?

00:48.411 --> 00:49.211
Nikki?

00:49.212 --> 00:52.012
You're the only good thing that's
happened to me since I've been back.

00:52.913 --> 00:53.413
Dan-- oh!

00:53.414 --> 00:54.614
Danny!

00:54.615 --> 00:55.523
Danny!

00:55.770 --> 00:57.464
Stop blaming me for nikki!

00:58.216 --> 00:59.716
Shawn, stop it.
You're killing him!

01:00.317 --> 01:02.790
So this whole "see the future" thing.

01:02.791 --> 01:05.759
it doesn't just apply to
earth-shattering events. huh?

01:05.854 --> 01:07.906
Not always.
That one.

01:08.319 --> 01:11.919
Baby girl, you are my new lucky charm.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.260
Do you know what I bet?

01:13.261 --> 01:15.913
Try my mother's diamond engagement ring.

01:15.914 --> 01:16.739
and now it's gone.

01:16.742 --> 01:18.572
You said winning didn't matter.

01:18.573 --> 01:19.914
You said you liked me.

01:19.922 --> 01:21.422
This was all just a test...

01:21.423 --> 01:22.623
and you failed.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.924
This doesn't sound like me, lucy.

01:23.925 --> 01:24.968
So change it.

01:24.969 --> 01:25.960
You're the boss.

01:26.126 --> 01:26.726
Matthew ross.

01:26.727 --> 01:27.427
Yes.

01:27.428 --> 01:29.436
Jordan made it clear that
in the event of his death.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.655
I was to step up front and center to help you out.

01:31.729 --> 01:33.727
The ground just shifted under your feet.

01:33.728 --> 01:36.030
You either find your balance,
or you fall on your ass.

01:36.430 --> 01:40.830
The fact is that everyone
alive today owes jordan collier.

01:40.831 --> 01:43.531
He had a vision to save the future.

01:43.532 --> 01:45.932
You were waiting in the hallway
outside my apartment last night.

01:45.933 --> 01:47.337
I don't know how I got there.

01:47.338 --> 01:49.597
Please. believe me.
I had another blackout last night.

02:05.534 --> 02:06.434
Kyle?

02:08.035 --> 02:08.735
Kyle!

02:08.735 --> 02:10.836
Yeah, I'm in here.
Hold on a sec.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.437
It's 10 after 8:00.
You taking the day off?

02:18.638 --> 02:19.908
I guess my alarm didn't go off.

02:19.909 --> 02:20.564
You'd better get moving.

02:20.565 --> 02:22.499
Your first class is at 9:00 on tuesdays, right?

02:22.608 --> 02:23.942
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:24.091 --> 02:26.276
Want me to get you some smelling salts?
Come on, buddy. it's time to roll.

02:26.277 --> 02:27.017
Let's go.

02:27.834 --> 02:29.397
Alana called last night.

02:29.398 --> 02:30.569
I forgot to tell you.

02:31.155 --> 02:32.851
She's in barcelona, kyle.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.712
There's only like a 20-minute
window when we're both awake.

02:35.713 --> 02:36.813
Any message?

02:36.814 --> 02:39.414
Yeah, She...she.uh.

02:39.415 --> 02:41.861
she bought a couple of paintings for her gallery.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.085
and she misses you.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.016
Next time she calls and I'm not here-- yeah.

02:45.017 --> 02:46.336
yeah. I'll try to remember.

02:46.337 --> 02:47.475
I've got to get ready, Okay?

02:47.510 --> 02:49.500
Right, Well, I can't wait.
You're going to have to grab the bus.

02:49.501 --> 02:51.927
and don't leave your towel
on the bathroom floor again. okay?

03:25.519 --> 03:26.619
Ben?

03:28.220 --> 03:29.520
Tyler?

03:29.521 --> 03:30.921
My god. You haven't changed.

03:30.922 --> 03:33.122
50-year vacation will do that for you.

03:33.923 --> 03:34.323
You look...

03:34.324 --> 03:37.224
I look old.Especially next to you.

03:37.225 --> 03:39.725
I had you beat by eight months.

03:40.126 --> 03:41.326
Last time I saw you was...

03:41.327 --> 03:44.327
in a tent, Outside of sinanju, Korea.

03:44.328 --> 03:46.628
May 11th. 1951.

03:46.929 --> 03:47.829
You remember the date.

03:47.830 --> 03:50.569
Sometimes I have trouble
remembering my grandkid's birthday.

03:50.570 --> 03:52.553
but that's a day that I'll never forget it.

03:53.931 --> 03:56.231
I mean, lee hit you.
and you, uh...

03:56.832 --> 03:58.432
I don't know, you disappeared.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.333
So. what are you doing here, ben?

04:13.334 --> 04:16.834
You remember milton weinberg,
your old wingman?

04:17.435 --> 04:21.435
Milt was the first guy who invited me over
to sit at his table in the officers' mess.

04:21.736 --> 04:23.236
He passed on.

04:23.237 --> 04:25.437
Parkinson's disease.

04:25.438 --> 04:27.638
I'm sorry.I knew you guys were close.

04:28.639 --> 04:31.439
And I'm sure he would
want you at the funeral.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.147
Is.uh...
Lee going to be there?

04:40.542 --> 04:41.942
We treated you as an equal.

04:41.943 --> 04:43.106
but that wasn't good enough for you.

04:43.107 --> 04:44.413
You had to cross the line.

04:46.444 --> 04:48.744
None of us has spoken to lee in years.

04:51.045 --> 04:52.445
I'll be there...

04:53.146 --> 04:55.246
out of respect for Milt.

05:08.047 --> 05:09.247
Is he okay?

05:09.248 --> 05:10.948
Better than okay.

05:11.549 --> 05:14.997
Heart rate, respiration, reflexes...

05:14.998 --> 05:16.468
all above average.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.450
Say hello to your healthy child.

05:21.251 --> 05:22.751
Edwin. I...

05:23.552 --> 05:26.852
I can't even find the words.
We don't know how to thank you.

05:26.853 --> 05:29.053
And he's going to know all about you.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.454
the nurse who changed his life.

05:31.455 --> 05:33.755
Enjoy your son, mr. And mrs. Ward.

05:34.156 --> 05:35.656
Keep him safe.

05:49.358 --> 05:50.558
Edwin. Do you have a second?

05:50.559 --> 05:52.359
I'm sorry. doctor.
I'm due in the nursery.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.860
It can wait.

05:54.261 --> 05:56.061
I want to know what
you did to the ward baby.

05:56.062 --> 05:58.262
We did amnio in the first trimester.

05:58.263 --> 06:00.473
That baby was diagnosed
with prader-willi syndrome.

06:00.474 --> 06:02.374
Perhaps there was some mistake in the tests.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.175
You saw those results, edwin.

06:04.176 --> 06:05.922
The 15th chromosome was damaged.

06:05.923 --> 06:08.539
That indicates severe
mental retardation at birth.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.907
but their kid just scored
nine on the apgar test.

06:10.908 --> 06:14.108
A miracle is traditionally cause
for celebration, not an inquisition.

06:14.109 --> 06:17.009
This is the fourth time this
has happened in the last six months.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.410
In every one of those cases.
edwin. you are the attending nurse.

06:23.811 --> 06:25.911
And you're one of the 4400.

06:25.912 --> 06:28.082
I'm not sure I see the connection.

06:28.083 --> 06:31.148
Everyone's read about that
kid who's running the 4400 center now.

06:31.297 --> 06:33.791
They say he's cured diseases like A.L.S..

06:33.802 --> 06:36.785
Diseases no hospital in
the world can put a dent in.

06:38.085 --> 06:39.785
He's a healer.

06:39.786 --> 06:41.186
So are you.

06:44.387 --> 06:47.687
For me, it only works in utero.

06:48.188 --> 06:50.988
I can feel the damage
to their chromosomes.

06:50.989 --> 06:54.089
I'm not sure exactly how it works.but,

06:54.090 --> 06:56.900
somehow, I'm able to repair them.

06:58.201 --> 06:59.201
That's incredible.

06:59.202 --> 07:01.486
Dr.Hodler,
if it's all the same to you.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.664
I'd prefer to work anonymously.

07:04.103 --> 07:07.003
There are already rumors in
this hospital of miracle births, edwin.

07:07.404 --> 07:09.104
and people talk.

07:09.105 --> 07:11.105
I don't think you're
going to have that option.

08:15.007 --> 08:17.257
<i>So long ago.</i>

08:17.787 --> 08:19.765
<i>another life</i>

08:20.226 --> 08:24.358
<i>I can feel your heart beat</i>

08:24.371 --> 08:29.441
<i>it's not a dream remember us</i>

08:29.604 --> 08:33.587
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

08:33.907 --> 08:37.216
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

08:37.244 --> 08:42.249
<i>our place in time beyond the sun</i>

08:42.554 --> 08:46.662
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

08:46.665 --> 08:51.728
<i>our place in time to call our own</i>

09:05.976 --> 09:07.307
Wait a minute.

09:07.307 --> 09:11.906
It's Gavin Maar, I'v read statement yesterday.
Why are they sending us these again.

09:11.941 --> 09:12.615
Maybe we missed something.

09:12.816 --> 09:15.816
There were a thousand people at
the party where collier got assassinated.

09:15.817 --> 09:19.717
Wouldn't you think that they could at least
send us a new set of completely useless files

09:20.118 --> 09:21.518
Any hot leads in there?

09:22.100 --> 09:22.919
I didn't think so.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.720
I'm pulling you off the collier case,
just for the moment.

09:25.721 --> 09:27.121
Something important, I hope.

09:27.122 --> 09:29.822
One of the files in the morning
research report caught my eye.

09:30.023 --> 09:32.223
There's an internet chat
room for pregnant women.

09:32.304 --> 09:34.059
Yesterday,someone
started a thread about some

09:34.060 --> 09:36.604
unexplained reversals of
birth defects at mercy hospital.

09:36.639 --> 09:39.125
So you're yanking us off collier
to check out internet chatter?

09:39.626 --> 09:41.626
There's a 4400 who works at the hospital.

09:41.627 --> 09:42.727
Bingo.

09:43.028 --> 09:45.628
Edwin mayuya.
He was born in rwanda.

09:45.929 --> 09:47.419
So this guy's some kind of healer?

09:47.420 --> 09:50.220
According to the internet.
Don't worry, you're still the alpha dog.

09:50.221 --> 09:51.544
It's not like I mind.

09:51.545 --> 09:52.545
It's great if he is, of course.

09:53.622 --> 09:54.822
We should invite him to the center.

09:54.823 --> 09:57.623
At the very least,
I think mr.Mayuya merits a sitdown.

09:57.624 --> 09:59.524
All right, set it up.
I'll be there.

09:59.925 --> 10:02.125
Why don't you let me
handle the meet and greet?

10:02.126 --> 10:03.926
I'll figure out if there's
anything to these stories.

10:05.127 --> 10:06.020
In the meantime,

10:06.021 --> 10:08.221
there's a move I'd like
you to consider making.

10:08.328 --> 10:10.428
Call it the next phase in
your development as a leader.

10:10.429 --> 10:13.029
Matthew, I told you,
I will read the art of war, okay?

10:14.230 --> 10:15.730
I want you to call your mom.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I know jordan counseled you
to distance yourself from your family.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.900
Before jordan was telling me anything,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.800
my family had already distanced themselves from me.

10:28.900 --> 10:31.500
Family dynamics are complex.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.400
I don't think that a phone call

10:33.500 --> 10:35.700
is going to lead straight into some kind of group hug.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.400
Even if it leads to just dinner,

10:37.500 --> 10:38.500
you're heading in the right direction.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.500
But,matthew

10:39.600 --> 10:40.500
what is it to you?

10:40.600 --> 10:42.700
Right now,every news desk in the country

10:42.800 --> 10:44.500
is taking a long,hard look at you.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.700
They're looking for a weakness.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.400
And because I'm not speaking to my family,

10:47.500 --> 10:48.600
that implies what?

10:48.700 --> 10:50.400
Everybody here is supposed to do likewise?

10:50.500 --> 10:52.500
The press will spin it that way.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.000
That's how they smear us with the "cult" label.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.700
You want me to stir up all of this old business

10:57.800 --> 10:59.400
as a publicity ploy?

10:59.500 --> 11:02.800
You can take care of it now,or wait

11:02.900 --> 11:05.900
and see it splashed all over the newspapers.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.700
Here's your mom's phone number.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.900
In case you forgot.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.500
comes in and says,

11:50.600 --> 11:52.900
"how do you think I rang the bell?"

11:56.400 --> 12:00.300
We were just saying,what a nice ceremony this was,Old milt

12:00.400 --> 12:02.800
he left a great family behind.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.500
He had a lot of love to spread around.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.300
We thought you got killed,

12:07.400 --> 12:08.300
or captured, maybe.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.600
There was some talk you went awol.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.700
None of us put any stock in that.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.500
Disappearing in a beam of light-- nobody thought of that,huh?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.600
Hey,uh, you in town tonight?

12:19.700 --> 12:22.800
Oh, good.We're going to have our own private wake for milt down at chauncey'S.

12:22.900 --> 12:23.800
You know he loved his bud,

12:23.900 --> 12:26.400
so we're going to hoist a few in his memory.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.300
You should come.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.200
We'll kick around old times.

12:29.300 --> 12:31.400
"Old times" was hardly more than a year ago for me.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.400
You can fill in the gaps,then.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.000
There's a lot of stuff we don't remember anymore.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.500
Chance to swap tall tales with you old duffers?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.500
Wouldn't miss it.

12:42.500 --> 12:47.200
Ntac has examined me several times already this year.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.200
I don't think I'm due for another for?

12:50.300 --> 12:52.000
three months,I believe.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.000
You've never missed an appointment.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.600
We appreciate that.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.800
You just admitted to us that you've developed this ability.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.600
It's a kind of earth-shaking one,I have to say.

13:00.700 --> 13:01.100
Forgive me,

13:01.200 --> 13:02.700
but I don't see how submitting

13:02.800 --> 13:05.100
to another round of tests helps anyone.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.700
These mutations you can induce--

13:06.800 --> 13:08.900
I believe they are not mutations,sir.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.900
I believe they are repairs.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Either way,our doctors need to take a look at you.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.800
If they can figure out the way your ability works,

13:15.900 --> 13:18.000
it could help a lot of people.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.000
All right,then.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.300
I will let your doctors poke and prod me to their hearts' content.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.200
But I ask one thing--

13:28.300 --> 13:30.800
that you allow me my privacy.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.400
I do not want to become a public figure.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.500
Well,that works for us.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.500
I mean,whenever a new ability leaks to the press--

13:36.600 --> 13:37.800
good,bad,or whatever--

13:37.900 --> 13:39.100
it stirs a lot of people up.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.500
Precisely what I hope to avoid.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.800
I've seen firsthand the type of behavior

13:43.900 --> 13:45.600
that irrational fears can provoke.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.400
You left rwanda in april of 1994.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.600
That was the beginning of the tutsis' genocide.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.700
The beginning?

13:54.800 --> 13:59.200
Believe me,I saw my fill of horrors during those two weeks.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.400
If I hadn't been granted asylum here in america,

14:01.500 --> 14:03.100
I'd be dead.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.200
You were probably just getting used to the place when you got abducted,I'm sure.

14:06.300 --> 14:10.000
There were nights in kigali when I would have welcomed the chance

14:10.100 --> 14:13.900
to disappear from the face of this earth.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.400
So, uh,just let me get this straight--

14:19.500 --> 14:22.300
you used maia's predictions so that you could gamble?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.600
I didn't use her to gamble.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.300
I used her to win.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.700
You mean that you used her to cheat.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.100
You exploited a nine-year-old girl who loves you.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.000
She was having a good time.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.300
We both were.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.500
But only one of you is an adult.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.500
I can't believe that you're standing there defending it.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.500
Well, this part of it,

14:39.600 --> 14:41.500
I can kind of mount a credible defense.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.000
What,so you haven't got to the part that you're ashamed of yet?

14:45.100 --> 14:46.600
These bets?

14:46.700 --> 14:47.900
they were sure things?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.700
but I needed money to make them.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.000
You know mom's engagement ring?

14:53.100 --> 14:54.700
You mean the one that she left to me?

14:54.800 --> 14:57.900
The one I should have worn to my wedding.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.200
I pawned it.

15:04.700 --> 15:09.300
I just can't believe that I let maia anywhere near you.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.400
I want you out of here.

15:26.900 --> 15:27.800
Lucy.

15:27.900 --> 15:28.700
If I watch the news tonight,

15:28.800 --> 15:30.000
am I going to be a happy man?

15:30.100 --> 15:32.800
The stations I called all seemed very interested.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.600
A 4400 who cures birth defects?

15:34.600 --> 15:35.700
I'd cover it.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.300
I suppose the tip was anonymous?

15:37.400 --> 15:40.300
Believe me,I didn't want to leave my name.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.000
The center outing a 4400 to the media?

15:43.100 --> 15:45.300
Seems wrong somehow.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.300
Well,it's not business as usual,I grant you,

15:47.400 --> 15:49.900
but we leak it,we control the story,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.600
and it beats letting him rot in the basement at ntac.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.100
Did shawn go upstairs for the night?

15:54.200 --> 15:54.800
He went out.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.900
Personal business,he said.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.500
Good night, lucy.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.500
Who is it?

16:22.600 --> 16:23.700
Hello?

16:23.800 --> 16:25.300
Mom,are you going to,uh, are you going to open the door,

16:25.400 --> 16:27.600
or should i use my key?

16:29.200 --> 16:30.800
Shawn!

16:32.700 --> 16:35.700
I would've-- I would've called ahead,but I?

16:36.400 --> 16:38.300
?surprise.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.100
Will the 4400 prove to be the cure for all human disease?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.100
That's the question on everyone's lips,

16:45.200 --> 16:47.700
as it appears a member of the 4400

16:47.800 --> 16:52.400
has manifested the ability to reverse certain genetic birth defects in utero.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.000
Anonymous sources claim that edwin mayuya,

16:55.100 --> 16:57.400
a 38-year-old nurse at mercy hospital?

16:57.700 --> 16:58.600
murderer!

16:58.600 --> 17:00.300
...Is responsible for a series of miraculous healings?

17:00.300 --> 17:00.600
murderer!

17:00.600 --> 17:02.100
over the past five months.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.200
Murderer!

17:03.600 --> 17:04.000
Murderer!

17:04.000 --> 17:06.200
but if these claims prove true--

17:06.300 --> 17:07.300
that's the man,

17:07.400 --> 17:10.599
the one who killed your parents!

17:18.400 --> 17:19.700
There's more.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.900
I'm bouncing around in the shotgun seat.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.099
and tyler here has got the gas
pedal all the way through the floor?

17:25.200 --> 17:28.200
hey. we had 200 bucks on that race?

17:28.300 --> 17:30.100
and davis is 30 feet behind me.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.400
and I can barely hear him screaming--

17:32.500 --> 17:33.200
not that way.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.900
That's where the landmines are.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.200
If I knew he was serious.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.300
maybe I would have paid attention.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.000
Yeah.Yeah.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.300
Well.no one was going to follow us that way.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.400
so we came in two minutes before the pack.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.600
and we split the money.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.700
We bought like five kegs of
budweiser for the officers' club.

17:50.900 --> 17:51.900
Get a load of this.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.600
Looks just like it did back in the day.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.600
Like you.tyler.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.900
Hard to believe-- 50 years go by.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.300
we got the same guys.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.600
same beer.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.300
It's great to see you guys.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.200
It's a shame it took milt
dying to make it happen.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.700
It's hard to find excuses
to get the whole gang together.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.600
It's not exactly the whole gang, is it?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
There's always lee.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.200
Which one of you guys
is going to tell me where he is?

18:22.300 --> 18:23.700
Come on does it matter?

18:23.800 --> 18:25.500
Matters to me.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.600
Well.last I heard.he was in
a V.A.Hospital outside of bakersfield.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.700
In bad shape for a long time.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.200
Look.everyone here feels
terrible about what we did to you.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.700
Huh? Isn't that enough?

18:38.800 --> 18:42.100
You're not going to get
anything out of talking to lee. I mean.

18:42.300 --> 18:46.000
do yourself a favor-- just let it go.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.200
I don't give a damn.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.500
I don't care if he?

18:55.700 --> 18:56.300
What's up?

18:56.400 --> 18:58.000
You know your miracle healer?

18:58.100 --> 19:00.600
Turns out his real name is edwin musinga.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.900
All his papers have been forged.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.200
He's been wanted by the
rwandan government since 1995.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.200
Wanted for what?

19:07.300 --> 19:08.500
Atrocities.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.100
He was a doctor during the uprising.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.200
He's killed a whole bunch of people.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.900
I was a pediatrician at a clinic in kigali.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.500
I am a hutu.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.200
but most of my patients were tutsi.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.700
Many of my friends as well.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.400
That called my loyalty into
question when the killings began.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
Some men from the military came to my clinic.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.800
and they said they wanted
to broadcast it as a safehouse.

19:34.900 --> 19:38.600
a place tutsi could come
to be safe from the slaughter.

19:38.700 --> 19:39.500
And they came?

19:39.600 --> 19:41.400
By 3:00.the clinic was full.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.300
Every room. every corridor.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.300
all filled with frightened tutsi

19:46.400 --> 19:49.100
looking to me as their protector.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.200
The same soldiers came back?

19:51.300 --> 19:53.100
with militia at their side.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.600
It was a setup.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.700
Did you at least try to stop them?

19:56.800 --> 20:00.000
The radio reports were claiming

20:00.100 --> 20:02.900
the tutsis had killed our president.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.900
The anger spread like virus.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.000
I got infected. too.

20:09.100 --> 20:12.000
So basically. you stood by and did nothing?

20:12.100 --> 20:15.100
All over the city.it was organized murder.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.700
We never would have made it to safety.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.000
You could have tried.

20:18.100 --> 20:18.700
Easy tom.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.600
Let the man finish his story.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.800
Yes.I could have tried.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.300
That's true.I know that now.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.500
They made me watch.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.500
They killed them all.

20:30.200 --> 20:34.000
I allowed them to turn
my clinic into a slaughterhouse.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.500
But you didn't murder anyone personally.

20:37.700 --> 20:38.600
True.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.300
but not much of a distinction.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.300
I knew what was going to happen.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.600
I let it take place.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.300
I'm guilty.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.400
My wife left me.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.100
I have not seen her or my children since.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.500
Perhaps they will come to my execution.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.600
Your government's pushing for extradition.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.400
You should be on a plane right now.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.500
But your ability?

21:03.600 --> 21:05.500
complicates things.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.600
It would give me the
chance to make amends.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.200
But I could save an infant
every day for the rest of my life.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.100
and I'd still deserve
every one of my nightmares.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.400
What was going on in there tom?

21:20.500 --> 21:23.200
Because if you were looking to shut
him down before he got his story out.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.500
all that glaring was a
great way to go about it.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.000
That guy should be
on his way to a tribunal.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.100
Instead.we're serving
him lunch downstairs.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.400
Oh.what. would you
prefer it if we starved him?

21:31.500 --> 21:32.500
I don't believe you're defending him!

21:32.600 --> 21:34.100
I would never defend what he did.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.700
but I would make an
argument for what he can do now.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.300
There's a reason the future
sent him back with this amazing ability.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.300
But forgive me if I sound like?

21:41.400 --> 21:42.200
I don't know.you?

21:42.300 --> 21:43.700
No.No.not this time.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.100
No.we're not talking about a criminal.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.600
We're not even talking about a murderer.

21:46.700 --> 21:49.600
We're talking about genocide, Dian

21:49.700 --> 21:51.600
Maybe the future doesn't
have a problem with that.but I do.

21:51.700 --> 21:54.700
So if I don't believe that the world is
better off with a bullet in this guy's head.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.100
I'm advocating genocide?

21:56.200 --> 21:57.100
No.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.700
There are people in rwanda
right now who have lost mothers.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.900
brothers. and children in that clinic.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
and he stood by.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.000
and he let it happen.

22:05.100 --> 22:06.400
That's just like our government.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.700
just like governments all over the world.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.400
They all knew what was happening. tom.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.400
but nobody lifted a finger to stop it.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.400
Yeah. and that was wrong. too.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.000
and so is this.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.200
We've been working on
blind faith for a year and a half.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.900
assuming these people
knew what they were doing.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.200
but enough is enough.

22:19.300 --> 22:20.300
Yeah.we're saving the future.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.900
but we're leaving justice behind.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.200
Is it something that you
want to be a part of. Diana?

22:33.700 --> 22:35.600
so shawn just shows out of nowhere,

22:35.700 --> 22:37.700
and all of a sudden I'm supposed to drop all of my plans

22:37.800 --> 22:39.900
and head to some peace dinner,

22:40.300 --> 22:41.800
We both know why he's turned up now, right?

22:41.900 --> 22:44.800
You don't have to be a shrink to piece it together,

22:44.900 --> 22:46.200
His mentor daddy figure gets killed,

22:46.300 --> 22:47.300
and he comes crawling back to mommy,

22:47.400 --> 22:48.900
Danny, why don't you quit whining about shawn?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
He's your brother,It's been a year,Let it go,

22:51.100 --> 22:53.100
Hey, you're the guy who talked to him and 
told me how brainwashed he is,

22:53.200 --> 22:53.900
So if he's coming for dinner,

22:54.000 --> 22:54.700
that's a good thing, right?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.000
At least pretend it is,

22:56.100 --> 22:57.200
for your mom's sake,

22:57.300 --> 22:58.100
What's with the attitude, man?

22:58.200 --> 23:00.700
I just don't want to hear you bitch anymore, okay?

23:01.200 --> 23:03.600
I don't understand,

23:03.800 --> 23:05.800
Why do you have to go?

23:05.900 --> 23:07.700
Can't you just say you're sorry?

23:07.800 --> 23:10.300
It doesn't always work that way with grown-ups,

23:10.400 --> 23:13.900
Sometimes things gets so messed up

23:14.000 --> 23:15.800
that "sorry" doesn't cut it,

23:15.800 --> 23:18.100
Happens a lot when I'm involved,actually,

23:18.200 --> 23:20.200
But if you only just leave,

23:20.300 --> 23:22.300
nothing gets better,

23:28.800 --> 23:30.100
Sweetie...

23:30.600 --> 23:31.800
I'm sorry,

23:31.900 --> 23:33.800
I used you,

23:33.900 --> 23:35.600
It was wrong,

23:35.700 --> 23:37.700
But I forgive you,

23:37.800 --> 23:40.000
I still have to go,

24:02.600 --> 24:04.100
Well,I know I cooked all day

24:04.200 --> 24:06.000
but is my lasagna really that great?

24:06.100 --> 24:09.400
You're both just stunned into silence?

24:09.700 --> 24:11.700
I haven't had this stuff in,

24:11.800 --> 24:13.200
like a year,

24:13.300 --> 24:15.300
Good,You said something,

24:15.600 --> 24:18.000
Danny, why don't you give it a try?

24:19.900 --> 24:20.500
All right,you know what?

24:20.600 --> 24:21.900
That's it, Danny,

24:22.000 --> 24:23.500
this entire night is about you and me,

24:23.600 --> 24:24.800
That's why mom did this,

24:24.900 --> 24:26.000
you know?What do you want me to do,

24:26.100 --> 24:27.400
say we're all fine and dandy?

24:27.500 --> 24:28.200
It's not that easy,

24:28.300 --> 24:29.100
I don't expect it to be,

24:29.200 --> 24:31.800
but you and I obviously have some stuff 
we need to get into the open

24:31.900 --> 24:33.800
Okay,so you're going to apologize to me now,

24:33.900 --> 24:34.600
is that it?

24:34.700 --> 24:37.100
Or was I just imagining it when you screwed my girlfriend?

24:37.200 --> 24:38.400
The thing with nikki,

24:38.500 --> 24:40.100
I wish it wouldn't have happened that way,

24:40.200 --> 24:42.000
What about almost stopping my heart,

24:42.100 --> 24:43.000
or whatever it is that you did?

24:43.100 --> 24:44.200
You feel bad about that, too?

24:44.300 --> 24:44.700
You know what?

24:44.700 --> 24:46.100
You want to hate me forever?

24:46.200 --> 24:47.500
You be my guest,

24:47.600 --> 24:48.100
But you're my brother,

24:48.200 --> 24:50.100
and I came here to make things right by you,

24:50.200 --> 24:51.100
What do you want me to do?

24:51.200 --> 24:53.700
You need to punch me in the face or something?I mean

24:53.800 --> 24:54.700
be my guest

24:54.800 --> 24:55.700
Danny, don't you dare,

24:55.800 --> 24:56.500
Just one shot, ma,

24:56.600 --> 24:57.500
He deserves it,

24:57.600 --> 25:00.000
Look,he's even asking for it,

25:06.200 --> 25:08.100
Are we okay?Are we done?

25:13.800 --> 25:15.200
We're letting him walk?

25:15.300 --> 25:16.800
He's responsible for hundreds of deaths,

25:16.900 --> 25:19.500
His degree of culpability is not for us to determine,

25:20.500 --> 25:22.400
Okay,look,I can't ship him off to rwanda,

25:22.500 --> 25:24.000
Not yet, anyway,

25:24.100 --> 25:26.000
In the meantime,his 48-hour hold is up,

25:26.100 --> 25:29.200
and the 4400 center has hired lawyers who are pressing for his release,

25:29.300 --> 25:30.500
The press are all over this story,

25:30.600 --> 25:32.100
Will he even be safe on the streets?

25:32.200 --> 25:33.300
Yeah, a war criminal's safety,

25:33.400 --> 25:34.900
that's my big concern,

25:35.000 --> 25:35.900
Oh, it had better be,

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
In exchange for protection,

25:37.100 --> 25:39.700
edwin musinga has agreed to continue coming into our labs,

25:39.800 --> 25:41.600
We're babysitting him?

25:41.700 --> 25:44.700
In exchange for a chance to study what he can do,

25:44.800 --> 25:47.200
This guy could advance genetic research by a hundred years,

25:47.300 --> 25:49.800
It sounds like a fair trade to me,

25:50.600 --> 25:51.600
Mm-hmm,

25:56.700 --> 25:58.100
How long have you been feeling faint?

25:58.200 --> 25:59.700
On and off,perhaps a month,

25:59.800 --> 26:01.200
You should have told your doctors,

26:01.300 --> 26:03.000
You forget,miss skouris,I am a doctor,

26:03.100 --> 26:04.500
I have been anemic since I was 15,

26:04.600 --> 26:06.000
I'm certain--

26:08.600 --> 26:09.300
you okay?

26:09.400 --> 26:09.800
Yeah,

26:09.900 --> 26:11.800
Stay with him,I'm going out,

26:11.900 --> 26:14.100
Stay down,Stay down,stay down,

26:24.400 --> 26:26.000
Take these people out of here,

26:26.100 --> 26:29.700
I want a patrol car passing by every 20 minutes,

26:30.300 --> 26:31.300
Help!

26:31.400 --> 26:33.800
Someone call an ambulance!

26:36.000 --> 26:38.200
I think she's having a heart attack,

26:38.900 --> 26:40.800
He did this to her,

26:40.900 --> 26:42.200
Why are you protecting him?

26:42.300 --> 26:44.500
He's a murderer!

26:47.400 --> 26:49.600
How did this become public?

26:49.700 --> 26:50.500
Well,I assure you,

26:50.600 --> 26:51.500
it wasn't ntac,

26:51.600 --> 26:53.400
Perhaps if I had gone out and spoken to them,

26:53.500 --> 26:54.700
this could have been avoided,

26:54.800 --> 26:56.400
Oh, yeah,that would have calmed them down,

26:56.500 --> 26:57.900
They could have torn you apart,

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I think I have already demonstrated the lengths

27:00.100 --> 27:02.800
I'm willing to go in order to live,

27:04.000 --> 27:05.800
You can add another victim to your list,

27:05.900 --> 27:06.800
That woman is dead,

27:07.000 --> 27:08.700
Okay,tom,why don't you just go back outside?

27:08.800 --> 27:09.700
Take a walk around the block,

27:09.800 --> 27:11.200
You know why she was out there?

27:11.300 --> 27:11.800
Huh?

27:11.900 --> 27:13.400
Because this son of a bitch

27:13.500 --> 27:17.800
let her son,her daughter-in-law,and about 
eight of her nephews and nieces die,

27:17.900 --> 27:18.400
Huh?

27:18.500 --> 27:19.100
Isn't that right, doctor?

27:19.200 --> 27:19.700
Tom, stop!

27:19.700 --> 27:20.600
Isn't that right?

27:20.700 --> 27:21.400
stop!

27:21.500 --> 27:22.800
I regret her death,

27:22.900 --> 27:26.000
same as I regret them all,

27:26.100 --> 27:27.700
Yeah,well, I'm sorry you feel bad,

27:27.800 --> 27:29.300
but it doesn't change anything,does it?

27:29.400 --> 27:30.000
Tom, enough,

27:30.100 --> 27:30.700
Let him go,

27:30.800 --> 27:31.900
Now!

27:32.700 --> 27:34.100
Let him go,

27:42.700 --> 27:43.200
Look, Benjamin,

27:43.200 --> 27:44.800
I don't see what the problem is,

27:44.900 --> 27:46.800
Edwin musinga never killed anybody,

27:46.900 --> 27:48.100
Not personally, anyway,

27:48.200 --> 27:50.700
I already told you which senators to call,

27:50.800 --> 27:52.700
Get face time if you can,

27:52.800 --> 27:55.000
Do I have to fly out there and do this myself?

27:55.100 --> 27:56.000
I thought not,

27:56.100 --> 27:58.600
Blackberry me when things start to tip,

27:59.600 --> 28:00.800
Full-court press is on?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.400
I kind of wish I was out there,

28:02.500 --> 28:03.500
Cash in a few favors,

28:03.600 --> 28:04.900
watch the hill fall in line...

28:05.000 --> 28:07.600
do we really want to be cashing in favors for this guy?

28:07.700 --> 28:09.200
He says himself he's dirty,

28:09.300 --> 28:10.800
Oh, he's worse than dirty,

28:10.900 --> 28:12.200
He's practically a mass murderer,

28:12.300 --> 28:14.100
So why are we wasting our time with him?

28:14.200 --> 28:16.700
Somebody might come along who actually deserves our help, matthew,

28:16.800 --> 28:18.300
He's a 4400,

28:18.400 --> 28:21.200
Guilty or not,he's a part of what we're doing,

28:21.900 --> 28:24.000
They gave him that ability for a reason,

28:24.100 --> 28:26.700
and I doubt it has anything to do with being executed in rwanda,

28:26.800 --> 28:30.100
So let's say he didn't come back with an ability,

28:30.200 --> 28:34.100
Would we still be fighting the good fight on his behalf?

28:34.200 --> 28:35.300
You're the boss,

28:35.400 --> 28:37.000
You tell me,

28:44.100 --> 28:46.300
Breakfast is ready,

28:46.900 --> 28:50.000
You know you're going to start talking to me eventually,right?

28:50.100 --> 28:53.800
I seriously doubt that you can hold out till you're 18,

28:57.800 --> 28:59.700
She used you,maia,

28:59.800 --> 29:01.900
She said she was sorry,

29:02.000 --> 29:05.800
Well,there--there still has to be consequences,

29:05.900 --> 29:07.300
your ability is a gift,

29:07.400 --> 29:08.400
but it makes you a target, too,

29:08.500 --> 29:11.700
and I have to protect you from people who want to exploit you,

29:11.800 --> 29:13.100
Besides,

29:13.600 --> 29:16.100
you're not the only one your aunt april hurt this week,

29:16.200 --> 29:18.000
But I showed her the ring,

29:18.100 --> 29:21.200
She wouldn't even have known about it if it weren't for me,

29:21.300 --> 29:22.900
Well, you should never have been playing with it,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.500
which is why you don't get any tv this week,

29:26.600 --> 29:29.900
What your aunt did was completely different,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
and she knows it,

29:31.100 --> 29:33.200
She made a bad mistake,

29:33.300 --> 29:35.600
Isn't that what having a family's about?

29:35.700 --> 29:38.900
Forgiving someone when they make a bad mistake?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.100
It doesn't matter if I forgive her,

29:41.200 --> 29:42.400
I...

29:42.500 --> 29:44.200
I just can't have her around you,

29:44.300 --> 29:46.500
But we don't have such a big family,

29:46.600 --> 29:48.600
We can't just kick someone out--

29:48.700 --> 29:51.400
even if they mess up,

29:51.500 --> 29:52.500
Oh, Maia,

29:52.600 --> 29:55.200
you've got to-- do me a favor,

29:55.300 --> 29:58.100
Stop being more grown-up than your mom,

29:59.900 --> 30:01.000
Now, just come on,

30:01.100 --> 30:03.600
Come on,Your cereal's getting mushy,

30:04.500 --> 30:06.611
Come on, let's go,

30:09.000 --> 30:10.200
I am not kidding you,

30:10.300 --> 30:13.300
It was, like, the most intense 
wrist-burn I think I've ever given,

30:13.400 --> 30:14.900
He took it like a man,I'll give him that,

30:15.000 --> 30:16.500
After that,we ate,

30:16.600 --> 30:19.600
we talked a little bit,

30:19.900 --> 30:22.300
I was surprised-- it was pretty much okay,

30:23.100 --> 30:24.400
Good to hear,

30:25.500 --> 30:27.400
I was glad I went,

30:27.700 --> 30:29.700
Well, you know what that makes you?

30:30.600 --> 30:31.200
Right,

30:31.300 --> 30:33.400
Yeah,I'm a genius,

30:34.000 --> 30:34.800
I don't get it,kyle,

30:34.900 --> 30:37.400
Look,you're pissed at me when 
I tell you I don't want to see shawn,

30:37.500 --> 30:39.600
and then I do it,and I tell you it went pretty good,

30:39.700 --> 30:40.500
and I get a big shrug,

30:40.600 --> 30:42.200
Nobody asked you to sit here, man,

30:42.300 --> 30:43.200
What's going on,kyle?

30:43.300 --> 30:44.300
What,are you blacking out again?

30:44.400 --> 30:45.100
Just forget it,

30:45.200 --> 30:46.600
Look, if you don't tell me what's going on,

30:46.700 --> 30:47.400
I'll talk to your dad,

30:47.500 --> 30:48.400
I am not blacking out,all right?

30:48.500 --> 30:50.600
I feel fine,You're not saying a word to my dad,

30:50.700 --> 30:51.200
Yeah?

30:51.300 --> 30:54.100
Then tell me why you're walking around like a zombie,

31:00.400 --> 31:02.600
I can remember now,

31:03.600 --> 31:06.800
Some of the things I was doing during those blackouts,
I can remember,

31:06.900 --> 31:08.300
Like what?

31:08.400 --> 31:10.300
I'm in trouble, that's all I can tell you,

31:10.400 --> 31:11.800
I'm in big trouble,

31:11.900 --> 31:14.000
Is there anything I can do?

31:14.500 --> 31:15.000
Help yourself,

31:15.100 --> 31:17.100
Stay away from me,

31:33.300 --> 31:35.000
Got a cigarette?

31:35.700 --> 31:36.600
You have emphysema,

31:36.700 --> 31:38.100
I know I have emphysema,

31:38.200 --> 31:40.800
What I don't have is a cigarette,

31:41.600 --> 31:43.100
Do you know who I am?

31:43.200 --> 31:46.500
For a second, I thought you were the angel of death,

31:47.200 --> 31:48.700
Richard tyler,

31:52.100 --> 31:53.800
How was weinberg's funeral?

31:53.900 --> 31:55.000
Simple,

31:55.100 --> 31:56.700
Dignified,Kind of like milt,

31:56.800 --> 31:59.200
Never did like his politics much,

31:59.300 --> 32:01.700
You know, after you disappeared, he blamed me,

32:01.800 --> 32:03.900
Fought me once or twice,

32:04.000 --> 32:05.900
Of course, he was wrong,

32:07.000 --> 32:08.400
So what are you here for?

32:08.500 --> 32:09.700
Going to slap me around a little bit?

32:09.800 --> 32:12.500
Shut off my oxygen tank?

32:12.700 --> 32:13.700
Uh...

32:13.800 --> 32:15.700
you don't make a very appealing target these days,lee,

32:15.800 --> 32:18.600
What,then?Looking for an apology?

32:20.600 --> 32:22.900
When I first got back,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
I used to lie awake in quarantine thinking about you,

32:26.100 --> 32:28.600
All the things I would do to you if I ever saw you again,

32:28.700 --> 32:29.900
Oh,

32:30.700 --> 32:32.000
You want vengeance,

32:32.100 --> 32:32.700
Well,

32:32.800 --> 32:35.400
sorry to disappoint you, 
that's not going to work out either,

32:35.500 --> 32:38.500
Time has kicked my ass worse than you ever could,

32:38.600 --> 32:40.700
Time kicks everybody's ass,lee,

32:40.800 --> 32:42.500
Get you too,eventually,

32:42.600 --> 32:46.400
Caught up with old milt,didn't it,for sure,

32:47.600 --> 32:49.200
At the funeral,

32:49.300 --> 32:52.500
those guys were tripping over each other to say sorry,

32:52.600 --> 32:54.500
But you've had 50 years to dwell on what you did...

32:54.600 --> 32:57.100
I didn't like hitting a fellow officer,

32:57.200 --> 32:58.700
but you gave me cause,

32:58.800 --> 33:00.300
I ate beside you,I fought beside you,

33:00.400 --> 33:01.700
but when you took up with a white woman,

33:01.800 --> 33:03.200
you crossed the line,

33:03.300 --> 33:04.600
That's what you said back then,

33:04.700 --> 33:06.600
I'm saying it again now,

33:07.900 --> 33:10.000
The world's changed,lee,or haven't you noticed?

33:10.100 --> 33:13.700
The world,maybe,Not me,

33:13.800 --> 33:15.900
And how's that working out for you?

33:16.000 --> 33:17.300
I stopped by your room,

33:17.400 --> 33:18.600
No cards,

33:18.700 --> 33:20.000
No flowers,

33:20.100 --> 33:23.300
The lady at the front desk couldn't believe you had a visitor,

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
You know,

33:25.900 --> 33:28.200
I really wish you'd brought some cigarettes,

33:28.300 --> 33:31.000
You always did stick to your habits,lee...

33:31.100 --> 33:33.400
even after they started to kill you,

33:37.900 --> 33:39.500
So long,

33:44.500 --> 33:47.500
They're not just statistics, Diana,

33:47.600 --> 33:49.300
He let that happen,

33:49.400 --> 33:50.100
I know what he did,

33:50.200 --> 33:52.700
and I don't need you to rub my nose in it,

33:52.800 --> 33:55.500
It's worth putting the faces to the numbers,

33:55.500 --> 33:57.400
We've got a problem,

33:59.800 --> 34:02.200
The state department has decided to fight extradition,

34:02.300 --> 34:04.000
They're going to argue special circumstances,

34:04.100 --> 34:05.400
So edwin gets a pass?

34:05.500 --> 34:07.700
And who knows how many kids get a shot at a normal life?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.400
No, not as many as we'd hoped,

34:09.500 --> 34:11.500
Our labs can't even figure out how his ability works,

34:11.600 --> 34:13.699
forget about replicating it,

34:13.800 --> 34:15.400
And I just got his med eval,

34:15.500 --> 34:16.600
It turns out he's in bad shape,

34:16.699 --> 34:17.699
Well, he told me he's anemic,

34:17.800 --> 34:18.500
and he couldn't sleep,

34:18.600 --> 34:19.600
No,no,it's worse than that,

34:19.699 --> 34:22.000
This ability,every time he rearranges a fetal chromosome,

34:22.100 --> 34:23.699
he's damaging his own,

34:23.800 --> 34:25.199
So if he keeps healing...

34:25.300 --> 34:27.000
It's going to kill him.

34:42.100 --> 34:44.699
Listen, if you don't want to talk about what you did,

34:44.800 --> 34:46.699
I'm not going to try to force you to,

34:46.800 --> 34:49.400
But I guarantee you,whatever it is,

34:49.500 --> 34:51.500
there's a way out of it,

34:51.600 --> 34:53.600
That's easy to say, You don't know what it is,

34:53.699 --> 34:55.400
So tell us,

34:55.500 --> 34:57.500
How can we help you if we don't know what's going on?

34:57.600 --> 34:58.500
I didn't ask for help,

34:58.600 --> 35:00.600
In fact, I told you not to mention it to anyone, danny,

35:00.700 --> 35:02.500
And I'm not "anyone",

35:02.600 --> 35:03.100
I'm your friend,

35:03.200 --> 35:04.300
Stop saying that, okay?

35:04.400 --> 35:05.200
I know you two mean well,

35:05.300 --> 35:07.700
but you don't have a goddamn 
clue what you're talking about,

35:07.800 --> 35:10.100
I have to deal with this on my own,

35:10.200 --> 35:11.300
We get it,

35:11.400 --> 35:13.700
On your own, absolutely,

35:13.800 --> 35:16.000
And we're going to help you do that,

35:18.500 --> 35:20.800
I think what he's trying to say

35:20.900 --> 35:26.600
is if you need some time to clear your head and 
get away from everything so you can figure stuff out,

35:26.700 --> 35:29.100
I can make that happen,

35:30.600 --> 35:32.700
Come to the center with me, kyle,

35:32.800 --> 35:34.400
You're turning this into a recruiting drive?

35:34.500 --> 35:36.600
That's not what I'm talking about,

35:36.700 --> 35:38.000
You will have the space you need,

35:38.100 --> 35:39.500
No one will bother you,

35:39.600 --> 35:43.400
Kyle, if you ever get to the point where you 
feel like you want to talk to somebody,

35:43.500 --> 35:44.800
we have counselors,

35:44.900 --> 35:47.200
therapists, lawyers,

35:48.800 --> 35:50.700
It was worth a try, man,

35:51.000 --> 35:54.300
because whatever you're doing right now, 
it's not working,

35:55.400 --> 35:57.100
My car is outside,

35:57.200 --> 36:00.200
You can come with me right now,if you want,

36:07.100 --> 36:08.100
Okay,

36:08.600 --> 36:11.000
Just let me... I got a couple of things to take care of...

36:11.100 --> 36:13.400
get a leave of absence from school, stuff like that,

36:13.500 --> 36:14.700
I'll meet you there tonight,

36:14.800 --> 36:16.500
And I'll be waiting,

36:16.600 --> 36:17.600
Okay,

36:19.200 --> 36:21.000
Thank you, guys,

36:24.800 --> 36:26.000
How much time do I have left?

36:26.100 --> 36:27.600
Well,that's difficult to say,

36:27.700 --> 36:30.900
I mean,your genes are mutating 
every time you heal a fetus,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.200
There's an indication of heart disease developing,

36:33.300 --> 36:35.700
You have spinal irregularities on your MRI,

36:35.800 --> 36:39.400
If you keep healing,maybe a year, maybe less,

36:39.500 --> 36:40.700
And if I stop?

36:40.800 --> 36:42.600
Oh,well,I mean, if you stop healing,

36:42.700 --> 36:46.100
then there's no reason for the state
 department to fight the extradition,

36:46.200 --> 36:48.200
You'll be handed back to the rwandan government,

36:48.300 --> 36:51.900
Who will have me tried and sentenced with all dispatch,

36:52.500 --> 36:53.800
So...

36:54.900 --> 36:58.100
either choice that I make leads to my death,

36:59.800 --> 37:01.900
Yes,that's right,

37:09.100 --> 37:13.000
It would seem my abductors have 
quite a perverse sense of humor,

37:17.100 --> 37:19.400
I will, of course, continue to heal

37:19.500 --> 37:22.000
for as long as my body allows,

37:22.200 --> 37:26.000
At least then, my death will have a 
purpose other than vengeance,

37:26.500 --> 37:28.500
You'll have to be monitored by doctors from here on in,

37:28.600 --> 37:29.900
They'll try and slow your decline,

37:30.000 --> 37:31.400
but you really should come with us,

37:31.500 --> 37:34.400
because we have some of the best 
physicians in the world on payroll,

37:34.500 --> 37:36.400
Miss Skouris,if you're offering me a bed at ntac,

37:36.500 --> 37:39.000
I'm afraid I have to refuse,

37:39.300 --> 37:43.000
I did not pass up one prison so I can die in another,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.500
There is one place you could go,

37:54.900 --> 37:57.300
Ntac medical's going to need him five days a week,

37:57.400 --> 37:59.000
so I'll get you the schedule,

37:59.100 --> 38:02.500
We'll make sure he's there on time, every time,

38:02.900 --> 38:04.500
Edwin musinga,this is shawn farrell,

38:04.600 --> 38:06.000
He runs the center,

38:06.100 --> 38:07.900
and you two have a lot in common,

38:08.000 --> 38:09.600
Not a lot,

38:10.000 --> 38:11.900
Just one thing,

38:12.500 --> 38:14.600
One very important thing,

38:27.600 --> 38:28.400
Did you tell him?

38:28.500 --> 38:30.100
Yeah,He's going to keep healing,

38:30.200 --> 38:31.700
Not that that surprises me,

38:31.800 --> 38:33.300
I took him over to the 4400 center,

38:33.400 --> 38:36.500
I think he's probably better off 
there than he is at home,

38:36.700 --> 38:38.600
How does it feel, tom?

38:38.700 --> 38:39.700
Some babies'll get saved,

38:39.800 --> 38:42.400
and you'll get your pound of flesh,

38:43.300 --> 38:44.600
You really want to know?

38:44.700 --> 38:46.100
I asked you, didn't I?

38:46.200 --> 38:48.300
It feels like justice,

39:35.600 --> 39:36.700
Hi

39:38.400 --> 39:39.700
How'd you find me?

39:39.800 --> 39:43.200
Sometimes it's good to have a kid who knows things,

39:43.300 --> 39:44.800
What's in Berkeley?

39:44.900 --> 39:46.800
A tattoo shop that likes my work,

39:46.900 --> 39:51.000
Oh, Some friends I can force myself on for a while,

39:55.000 --> 39:56.700
Listen, Di...

39:56.800 --> 39:59.300
I said this to Maia, but...

39:59.800 --> 40:01.700
I'm so sorry,

40:03.200 --> 40:05.100
Well, it's nice to hear,

40:05.200 --> 40:07.300
but it doesn't change anything,

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
You are so deceitful, and you're 
completely untrustworthy, and

40:12.100 --> 40:15.500
well, you're not seeing maia until 
you've proven otherwise,

40:15.600 --> 40:18.100
I wish I knew how to make things right,

40:18.200 --> 40:19.900
Yeah,I wish I did, too,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.900
And I do know it's going to take a long time,

40:23.000 --> 40:24.400
But you're still my sister,

40:24.500 --> 40:27.100
and you're the only one I've got,

40:27.200 --> 40:28.900
and I'm, uh...

40:29.000 --> 40:31.300
well, I'm not giving up on you,

40:41.600 --> 40:44.100
You bought it back from the pawn shop,

40:44.200 --> 40:47.500
I know you always felt that 
mom should have left it to you,

40:47.600 --> 40:48.200
and tell you the truth,

40:48.300 --> 40:51.500
I thought she only gave it to me because she...

40:51.800 --> 40:56.300
well, she figured that was the only way I was 
ever going to get one of those things,

40:58.900 --> 41:02.200
Hmm, That's a whole othertherapy session,

41:03.200 --> 41:05.900
Di, I don't deserve this,

41:06.000 --> 41:07.300
No,you don't,

41:07.400 --> 41:09.300
but you're going to take it anyway,

41:10.600 --> 41:11.700
One day...

41:13.300 --> 41:16.100
Maia's going to wear that ring to her wedding...

41:17.300 --> 41:18.900
and I hope--

41:20.400 --> 41:21.100
well,

41:21.900 --> 41:24.600
I hope you know each other again by then,

41:25.800 --> 41:26.700
Yeah,

41:41.400 --> 41:42.300
Kyle?

41:48.900 --> 41:49.900
Dad,

41:50.300 --> 41:51.800
I had to leave,

41:51.900 --> 41:53.500
I'm sorry,

41:55.600 --> 41:56.900
Kyle?Hey,it's me,

41:57.000 --> 41:58.500
Uh, where are you, man?

41:58.600 --> 42:00.000
It's 2:00 A,M,

42:00.100 --> 42:01.800
You're not here yet,

42:02.700 --> 42:04.300
Listen, just-- when you get this,

42:04.400 --> 42:06.700
call me, or just show up,

42:06.800 --> 42:08.700
Okay? Show up,

42:09.700 --> 42:10.900
All right,

42:13.600 --> 42:14.500
Yeah,I know you two mean well,

42:14.500 --> 42:16.900
but you don't have a goddamn clue 
what you're talking about,

42:17.000 --> 42:19.800
I have to deal with this on my own

42:20.305 --> 42:26.222
