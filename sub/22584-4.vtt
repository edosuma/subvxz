WEBVTT

00:03.920 --> 00:06.593
A transport shuttle, no armaments.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.759
Their engines are down,
life support failing.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.599
-Crew?
-Two bio-signs, human.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.111
-Tractor beam.
-Send a squad to the docking port.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:31.640 --> 00:32.674
Move!

00:39.720 --> 00:40.869
Walk, human!

01:12.480 --> 01:15.597
Contact the High Council. Inform them
of the prisoners. Request instructions.

01:15.720 --> 01:18.109
Commander, disruptor fire
near the Brig.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.635
QI'yaH!

01:25.280 --> 01:27.669
It's been a long road

01:29.400 --> 01:31.436
Gettin' from there to here

01:32.760 --> 01:34.398
It's been a long time

01:36.200 --> 01:39.317
But my time is finally near

01:40.000 --> 01:43.470
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:44.160 --> 01:46.833
I will touch the sky

01:47.280 --> 01:50.875
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:51.040 --> 01:53.793
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:54.080 --> 01:58.278
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:58.880 --> 02:01.553
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:01.680 --> 02:05.559
I've got faith to believe

02:06.240 --> 02:08.913
I can do anything

02:09.039 --> 02:12.828
I've got strength of the soul

02:13.600 --> 02:16.273
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:16.400 --> 02:20.359
I can reach any star

02:21.920 --> 02:23.831
I've got faith

02:25.560 --> 02:28.393
I've got faith

02:29.320 --> 02:32.517
Faith of the heart

02:53.120 --> 02:54.439
You have a visitor.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.475
I'm busy.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.918
Stand up, Doctor.

03:10.560 --> 03:11.675
Arms.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.359
Jonathan Archer.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.272
What brings you here?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.150
They're naming the prison after you?

03:35.280 --> 03:37.589
I need to ask you some questions.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.710
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.108
It won't take long.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.677
Well, I suppose it's not every day
one gets to speak to the man who...

03:46.800 --> 03:48.279
"saved the planet."

03:49.160 --> 03:50.195
Please.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.429
I apologise for the clutter.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.275
I'm not allowed
traditional recording devices.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.434
You programmed a padd to unlock...

04:03.800 --> 04:06.030
every security door in the building.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.549
I was particularly proud of that.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.355
I made it all the way to Sausalito.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.636
On the rare occasion
I get stuck on a problem...

04:14.760 --> 04:19.390
I find a vigorous escape attempt
helps to clear the head.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.988
Go ahead.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.318
They're DNA sequences.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.959
That one's for a modification
of the human T-cell.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.076
It would render Sharat Syndrome
a thing of the past.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.875
That one...

04:37.360 --> 04:40.670
increases the visual spectrum by 5%.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.435
Of course,
none of this will ever be tested.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.790
They clear out my room
every few months.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.549
I'm told it all gets...vaporised.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.349
Why invest so much time and energy
on things no one will ever use?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.477
How can a supposedly...

04:55.680 --> 04:58.752
intelligent species reject technology...

04:58.880 --> 05:02.156
that would enhance ability,
relieve suffering?

05:03.560 --> 05:07.189
Genetic engineering has caused
a lot of suffering.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.953
So did splitting the atom...

05:09.280 --> 05:12.636
yet the first ships to colonise the
solar system were nuclear-powered.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.320
But you're not here to discuss that.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.549
Someone attacked
a Klingon bird-of-prey.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.348
The entire crew was massacred,
the ship is missing.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.431
I read the reports.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.679
I understand
the Klingons are quite annoyed.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.189
Looks like you might have
saved Earth for nothing.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.949
Whoever is responsible jettisoned
the Klingon crew into space.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.469
DNA was recovered from the bodies.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.795
Let me guess. Human?

05:39.400 --> 05:40.628
Not quite.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.435
I see.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.672
They were Augments.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.716
Their genetically-enhanced DNA
matched embryos stolen from...

05:51.840 --> 05:54.718
a medical facility over 20 years ago.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.279
Stolen by you.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.079
Soong used to work at Cold Station 12...

06:07.640 --> 06:09.949
a top-secret medical research station.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.271
Isn't that where Starfleet keeps
a stockpile of infectious diseases?

06:13.440 --> 06:16.273
Along with
genetically engineered embryos...

06:17.000 --> 06:19.389
Ieft over from the Eugenics Wars.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.915
It's been kept from the public
for obvious reasons.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.758
I remember Soong's trial.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.314
He wouldn't say what he did
with the embryos he stole.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.478
Now he claims that he took them...

06:28.600 --> 06:31.433
to a planet in the Trialus system
and raised them.

06:32.120 --> 06:36.477
They were around 10 years old when
he was captured, a decade ago.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.790
There could be a bunch of Augments
from the Eugenics Wars...

06:38.920 --> 06:39.909
running around loose.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.758
Not a pretty thought.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.916
What would they want with
a Klingon bird-of-prey?

06:44.080 --> 06:46.548
We don't know. Neither does Soong.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.871
At least he claims he doesn't.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.433
But he does think he can convince them
to surrender without a fight.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.113
You're bringing him along.

06:55.920 --> 06:59.071
There's also the fact that he spent time
in the Borderland.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.355
The Borderland?

07:00.480 --> 07:02.789
The area where
the Klingon ship was attacked.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.035
It's a volatile region...

07:04.160 --> 07:07.152
between the Klingon Empire
and the Orion Syndicate.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.598
It attracts the most
dangerous elements from both.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.869
Sorry I asked.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.310
The Klingons have threatened
to retaliate with everything they've got.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.911
We're the fastest ship
and the most experienced crew.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.119
We have to find the Augments
and bring them back.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.395
It's the only way to avert a war.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.872
We launch in six hours.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.994
We've mastered their engine controls.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.357
Wing-mounted disruptor cannons,
photon torpedo launchers.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.391
This ship's an arsenal.

07:42.640 --> 07:44.232
We're finally free.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.599
A fine ship.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.352
I thought you'd be pleased.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.993
I didn't sanction this attack.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.714
If you'd failed,
they would have come after all of us.

08:09.840 --> 08:10.795
I didn't fail.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.319
Their government knows what we did.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.271
They have ships hunting for us
right now.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.038
They won't find us.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.392
It was time for us to leave
this godforsaken planet.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.715
That was my decision, not yours!

08:28.200 --> 08:31.556
You've forgotten who I am? Have you?

08:33.960 --> 08:36.428
-No, Raakin.
-Say it.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.157
You're our leader.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.556
Don't ever make me ask you again.

08:48.840 --> 08:52.628
Notify me when the rest of our supplies
are onboard. We're leaving orbit.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.950
Permission to come aboard, sir?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.752
This is my Science Officer, T'Pol.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.919
No need for an introduction.
I admire your people very much.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.271
-We share a similar view of humanity.
-What view is that?

09:19.440 --> 09:21.431
That it could stand some improvement.

09:21.880 --> 09:25.919
I believe that's true of most species,
if not all.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.477
My Tactical Officer, Lieutenant Reed.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.830
-Doctor.
-I've heard of you...

09:31.200 --> 09:34.988
but I don't recognise your face. You're
not getting your fair share of publicity.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.676
I think I've had all I can stand.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.948
We've prepared some quarters.
You'll be under guard at all times.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.552
If you should decide you need
to "clear your head."

09:45.840 --> 09:49.879
We're on a starship soon to be
at high warp. Where exactly would I go?

09:51.240 --> 09:52.639
It's this way.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.755
If I could examine the DNA samples
the Klingons recovered...

09:56.880 --> 09:59.678
I could tell you something about
the current state of the Augments.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.756
I'll have the information sent
to your quarters.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.158
A laboratory would be preferable,
your Sickbay.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.954
Dr. Phlox's reputation rivals my own...

10:08.080 --> 10:11.152
before I was imprisoned, of course.
I'd enjoy trading notes with him.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.269
I'll consider it.

10:20.920 --> 10:24.037
-So how was the honeymoon?
-Honeymoon?

10:25.240 --> 10:28.915
You were on Vulcan another two weeks
after I left. I figured....

10:33.600 --> 10:35.795
It comes with everything but
its own protein resequencer.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.751
For that, I'll need another day.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.073
I like it.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.592
We don't have time to go over all
the details. Just try not to hit that button.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.477
We're cleared for launch.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.679
Here we are again.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.630
Wouldn't have it any other way.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.715
Travis.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.800
I just received an intelligence report.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.275
A Klingon warship was spotted near
Proxima colony.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.550
Admiral Forrest thinks
they could be conducting...

12:04.680 --> 12:06.557
reconnaissance for a future strike.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.472
I wanted to keep you up-to-date.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.071
My government is trying to work out
a diplomatic solution.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.316
There's still a chance
they'll be successful.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.039
Small chance.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.318
One other thing.

12:24.680 --> 12:28.195
It's your first official day of duty,
Commander T'Pol.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.115
A present.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.115
It's from the early 20th century.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.279
Should help keep you pointed
in the right direction.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.752
I'm glad you're with us.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.113
Thank you, Captain.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.835
Captain's Starlog, May 17,2154.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.311
We've crossed into the Borderland...

13:03.440 --> 13:06.398
three light-years from where
the Klingons were attacked.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.357
Still no sign of their ship.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.515
Malik...

13:14.000 --> 13:16.036
he was the rebellious one.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.915
Reminded me of myself
when I was his age.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.519
I came to think of them
as my own children.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.112
Must have been difficult
for you to leave them behind.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.712
I knew they'd survive.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.988
This is extremely sophisticated work
for 20th-century Earth.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.512
Well, I made some modifications
of my own.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.359
Really? What kind of modifications?

13:45.360 --> 13:48.238
I prefer to let my work speak for itself.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.593
I think it already has.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.634
I didn't realise you shared humanity's...

13:54.960 --> 13:58.270
reactionary attitude
toward this field of medicine.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.554
On the contrary...

14:01.320 --> 14:04.198
we've used genetic engineering on
Denobula for over two centuries...

14:04.320 --> 14:05.912
to generally positive effect.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.672
But you don't approve of what I've done.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.995
You tried to redesign your species.

14:10.240 --> 14:14.631
The first time that was attempted on
Earth, the result was 30 million deaths.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.633
We can't let past mistakes
hold us back.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.913
It's your responsibility as a scientist
to learn from past mistakes.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.998
-Well, what makes you think I haven't?
-I can read.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.837
-Two vessels are coming up behind us.
-Orion interceptors.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.351
Interesting way of saying hello. Hoshi?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.109
No response.

14:59.240 --> 15:02.789
-We're getting hammered down here!
-Keep firing.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.715
I'm picking up an energy surge
from one of the interceptors.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.319
-A weapon?
-No.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.317
Tucker to the Bridge.
Two of my people just disappeared.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.000
The interceptors have jumped to warp.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.634
They're gone.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.833
They took nine people, including T'Pol.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.953
There never used to be Orions
in this area.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.958
They must have expanded
their range of operations.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.916
It's a shame.
I really liked your Science Officer.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.593
How do I get them back?

15:43.560 --> 15:46.632
-It's not going to be easy.
-That's not what I asked you.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.672
They've most likely been taken
to a processing station.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.916
The nearest one's on Verex 3.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.113
-Archer to Bridge.
-Reed.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.750
Set a course for Verex 3,
best possible speed.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.148
Yes, sir.

15:59.440 --> 16:00.793
What'll happen to them there?

16:00.920 --> 16:04.196
They'll be ushered into
their new profession, as slaves.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.277
These stations are heavily guarded.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.914
Only legitimate traders
are permitted to enter.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.271
I have the feeling you found your way in.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.833
I had to establish a relationship
with the Orions.

16:16.080 --> 16:20.198
They helped me acquire certain goods
and equipment I needed to survive.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.076
I can get you inside...

16:24.480 --> 16:27.870
-but I can't get your people out.
-One step at a time.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.399
Raakin is taking us to another system...

16:40.800 --> 16:43.394
where we can live out our lives
in peace.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.429
But I'm sure he's already told you that.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.312
He doesn't tell me everything.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.670
This isn't what our father
would have wanted.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.155
He didn't raise us to run away and hide.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.838
Well, what do you propose?

16:57.280 --> 17:00.238
You could try to convince Raakin
to reconsider.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.950
He only wants one thing from me,
and it isn't advice.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.919
-lt doesn't suit you.
-What?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.157
Playing the victim.

17:18.040 --> 17:21.874
You chose Raakin.
You wanted the strongest for yourself.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.314
I still do.

17:27.560 --> 17:28.754
What is it you want?

17:35.520 --> 17:37.715
There's plenty of time for that.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.432
You are now the property
of the Orion Syndicate.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.194
Break the rules, and you will suffer.

17:51.360 --> 17:54.352
Follow the rules, and you will
suffer less. Take her.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.398
-Ensign.
-Commander!

18:16.520 --> 18:17.509
Are you all right?

18:17.640 --> 18:19.915
-This thing, it hurts.
-Don't touch it.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.714
Have you seen anyone else
from the ship?

18:22.840 --> 18:23.795
Just you.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.835
-Where are we?
-An Orion slave market.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.678
Slave market?

18:28.800 --> 18:32.918
The Orions traffic in forced labour.
We're being processed for auction.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.070
This can't be happening. They're going
to come for us, right? The ship?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.189
Ensign--

18:38.320 --> 18:39.309
The Captain's gonna get us out of here!

18:39.440 --> 18:40.429
Ensign!

18:42.920 --> 18:44.353
I don't know your name.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.119
Pierce, Jeffrey Pierce. I just signed on.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.031
Jeffrey, Enterprise will come.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.158
It may take some time.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.072
We should try to stay together
until they get here.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.790
Transmit your identification code.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.437
-Soong hasn't used this code in years.
-Give it time.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.591
You're cleared to proceed.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.635
Phlox.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.513
Transponder. It has
a range of 10 kilometres.

19:28.240 --> 19:32.358
You wander off more than a step or two,
we bring you right back here.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.992
You don't like me,
do you, Commander Tucker?

19:36.120 --> 19:37.519
No, I don't.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.039
You probably blame me for what
happened to your Vulcan...friend.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.313
That's enough.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.351
Your crew could use
a sense of humour.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.628
Make the engines a priority.
When it's time to leave...

19:50.760 --> 19:53.320
I have a feeling we're going to
need all the speed we can get.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.350
I read every transcript of every mission.
I thought I was prepared...

20:00.800 --> 20:04.634
that I knew what to expect.
Boy, was I wrong.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.395
If you wish, I can teach you
how to minimise your anxiety.

20:08.520 --> 20:12.069
Yeah, I'd like that. I'd like that a lot.

20:16.240 --> 20:20.119
-Leave her alone!
-Ensign, don't!

20:50.520 --> 20:52.272
You're doing well.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.836
Three million six!

21:07.960 --> 21:10.394
Not even my last wife
sold for that much.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.998
Bring that woman.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.113
Over here.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.318
You. Come with me.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.315
At least we know
four of your people are still here.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.715
Doesn't seem to be
much demand for humans.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.311
Those devices on their necks....

21:43.600 --> 21:46.478
Neurolytic restraints. Ingenious, really.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.876
They induce convulsive seizures
in disobedient slaves.

21:50.360 --> 21:52.874
If a slave attempts
to leave the premises....

21:55.000 --> 21:56.399
So if you try to beam them out....

21:56.520 --> 21:59.398
Wouldn't recommend it,
not if you want them alive.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.833
-They sell their own people?
-Only the women.

22:30.880 --> 22:35.590
Orion females are known for their
extreme appetites, their innate skills.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.749
Come on.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.155
T'Pol.

22:55.040 --> 22:55.995
You all right?

22:56.120 --> 22:59.112
-How many were taken?
-Nine. We've located five so far.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.550
We're working on a way to try and--

23:01.680 --> 23:04.797
She's sold. Buyers are over there.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.469
We made a wrong turn.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.596
Thank you so much, though. Thank you
for your help, really. Thank you.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.869
Let's go.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.875
He argues with every command I give,
defies me in front of the others.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.560
Some of them agree with what he did,
taking this ship.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.796
They've forgotten how
we've stayed alive all these years.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.957
My resolve was what kept us
from starving to death on that rock.

23:32.080 --> 23:35.356
They believe it's Malik
who liberated us from that rock.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.513
-You agree with them.
-How can you say that?

23:40.480 --> 23:42.311
I hear it in your voice.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.431
Malik's doing more than arguing
with your commands.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.351
He's plotting against you.

23:51.480 --> 23:54.916
-He wants to take your place.
-How do you know that?

23:57.400 --> 23:58.628
He told me.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.750
Malik's always wanted me.

24:02.960 --> 24:06.999
I knew he was planning something,
so I let him think I wanted him as well.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.476
He said that you're weak...

24:13.360 --> 24:15.669
that you're making all of us weak...

24:17.040 --> 24:21.352
that you're betraying Father's principles,
that if Father were here...

24:21.480 --> 24:23.596
he'd choose Malik to lead us.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.518
I will betray Father's principles.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.800
I'm going to kill my own brother.

24:33.800 --> 24:33.834
I'm going to kill my own brother.

24:47.560 --> 24:51.838
If you don't sell as a slave,
I will sell you as food.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.714
Oh, that's barely enough to cover
the expense of processing you.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.155
-Archer to Enterprise.
-Tucker here.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.236
We've located everyone,
including T'Pol.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.510
I'm gonna need six kilos
of tritanium cobalt.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.675
Nine.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.394
-Make that nine.
-That's half our supply.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.194
-I'll explain later. Just get it ready.
-Yes, sir.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.033
They normally remove
the restraint after a sale.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.479
We used the extra tritanium...

25:41.600 --> 25:44.273
to bribe one of the guards
to deactivate it but leave it on.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.630
Why can't we just buy
the rest of our people?

25:46.760 --> 25:49.832
T'Pol's already been sold. We don't
have time to try and buy them all.

25:49.960 --> 25:53.191
-We're almost there. Try to hold still.
-What kind of people are these?

25:53.400 --> 25:57.359
I'd say they're not unlike some of your
ancestors, judging from your accent.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.308
If I remember my history,
these Augments you love so much...

26:00.440 --> 26:01.759
had plenty of slaves.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.599
They were more like subjects.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.473
Oh. They were just treated like slaves.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.598
T'Pol could be shipped out any second.
Work fast.

26:15.480 --> 26:20.156
I told him everything. He thinks you're
planning an attack against him.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.233
-ls he going to move against me?
-See for yourself.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.956
Is this the move you expected?

26:28.040 --> 26:29.553
It's between us.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.032
I saved your life once...

26:32.160 --> 26:35.152
when we were children, pulled you
from the river when you fell in.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.315
I remember.

26:36.440 --> 26:39.159
Now, 10 years later,
you're plotting against me.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.999
I'm the strongest, and the smartest.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.760
Doesn't look that way from here.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.753
You would never have trapped me
like this.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.679
But I have.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.757
I'm sorry, Raakin.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.877
It's between us.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.589
Saul....

27:04.520 --> 27:08.513
-Jaya, listen to me.
-They only listen to me now.

27:23.920 --> 27:27.390
There was a time
when I looked up to you...

27:30.040 --> 27:34.318
-when I called you my brother.
-I am your brother.

27:34.480 --> 27:38.996
When you rejected our father's wishes,
you stopped being one of us...

27:39.960 --> 27:43.919
and when that happened,
you ceased to exist.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.876
Which makes this an act of mercy.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.639
Get rid of him.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.828
Don't.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.798
Not for him.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.676
We're sending the code now.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.109
Got it.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.429
Outside.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.837
Outside.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.317
The restraints are off!

29:34.280 --> 29:37.556
Slaves are loose! Slaves are loose!

29:52.120 --> 29:55.237
Trip, start beaming them, five at a time.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.754
Sorry, Captain. Hope you find
your people. Thanks for the ride.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.797
You've got spirit.
I might just keep you for myself.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.353
I'm not for sale.

30:23.920 --> 30:27.435
-Trip, have you got everyone?
-You and Soong are the only ones left.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.515
Soong got away.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.517
Locate him and beam him up.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.795
Soong's transponder signal, it's dead.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.039
Can you scan for his bio-sign?

30:50.160 --> 30:52.833
We're trying, but there's
too many people down there.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.468
Help me!

31:35.760 --> 31:37.512
Don't let them take me!

32:03.600 --> 32:06.160
Trip, two to beam up.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.673
You knew exactly where
the Orions were operating...

32:19.800 --> 32:21.631
you knew they'd abduct
members of my crew...

32:21.760 --> 32:24.558
maybe you were even hoping
they'd get you.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.437
-There was an outside chance.
-You were determined to escape...

32:28.560 --> 32:30.676
-no matter who got hurt.
-No one was injured.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.678
Nine of my people
were nearly sold into slavery.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.950
Two of them may have
permanent physical damage...

32:36.080 --> 32:37.149
because of the restraints.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.111
I didn't take this action lightly.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.111
Is that supposed to justify what you did?

32:41.240 --> 32:45.870
I'm simply saying it wasn't easy for me
to place you and your crew in jeopardy.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.958
I respect you, Captain.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.988
Then tell me how to find the Augments.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.679
You know where they're going.

32:56.120 --> 32:59.237
They didn't steal a Klingon ship
to go sightseeing.

32:59.680 --> 33:02.148
- They're dangerous.
- They're the future.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.950
They're stronger, smarter...

33:05.200 --> 33:08.875
free from sickness,
with lifespans twice as long as our own.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.994
You, more than anyone,
should appreciate what this means.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.435
Why me?

33:16.360 --> 33:17.395
Your father.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.397
Suffered from Clarke's Disease.

33:19.720 --> 33:23.076
His final years were marked
with extreme pain.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.231
My father has nothing to do with this.

33:25.360 --> 33:29.353
He didn't need to suffer. Genetic
engineering could have cured him.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.393
Those who want to suppress
my Augments...

33:31.520 --> 33:34.398
are the same ones who condemned
your father to death.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.595
Turn the ship around, Captain.
Go home.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.672
Leave them alone.

33:44.720 --> 33:48.793
I'm going to find them, Doctor.
Whether you help me or not.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.717
You're supposed to be resting.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.672
Dr. Phlox says I can resume
my duties this afternoon.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.195
I'm glad they got that thing
off with no problem.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.033
There's a slight ringing in my left ear...

34:17.199 --> 34:20.078
-but it should dissipate over time.
-Good.

34:22.719 --> 34:24.710
Well, I'll let you get back to that.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.429
Vulcans don't have honeymoons.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.675
After the ceremony,
I went to Mount Seleya to meditate...

34:35.199 --> 34:36.393
alone.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.232
It's none of my business, anyway.

34:42.520 --> 34:45.239
Orion interceptors, two of them.
Coming up fast.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.799
They're hailing us.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.358
-This is Captain Archer of the Starship--
-You've stolen our property.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.080
They were members of my crew.
You kidnapped them.

34:53.199 --> 34:56.556
Disengage your warp drive
and deactivate your weapons.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.113
That isn't going to happen.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.074
Malcolm.

35:09.280 --> 35:12.670
-They're targeting our nacelles.
-We're dropping out of warp.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.869
Torpedoes.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.279
There's another ship.

35:30.040 --> 35:33.077
The second Orion is veering off.
They're retreating.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.831
The Klingons are requesting to dock.

35:47.400 --> 35:51.279
I know he's on this ship.
We received his signal.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.397
When he tried to escape,
I saw him access a console.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.797
You were expecting us.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.278
-Where is he?
-ln the Brig.

36:01.520 --> 36:04.239
In a prison cell?
I want to speak with him.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.910
-I can't allow that.
-We saved your ship.

36:07.120 --> 36:11.238
My ship wouldn't have been in danger
if we hadn't come looking for you.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.039
What is it you want with us?

36:15.160 --> 36:16.957
My orders are to take you back to Earth.

36:17.920 --> 36:22.118
Earth considers my father
a criminal. Why?

36:23.440 --> 36:24.839
Because he brought us to life.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.589
You want to take us back to a world
that opposes our very existence.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.190
You attacked a Klingon vessel.
They're threatening war.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.072
That's not our problem.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.911
We don't care what happens to you.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.590
Humanity is no longer relevant.

36:42.720 --> 36:45.632
To quote one of your philosophers,
Nietzsche...

36:48.520 --> 36:51.592
"Mankind is something
to be surpassed."

36:54.240 --> 36:56.595
You think he was talking about you?

37:01.200 --> 37:03.077
I'm about to attack you.

37:04.720 --> 37:05.914
You see?

37:06.040 --> 37:08.395
Even with a warning,
you're not fast enough.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.555
Let him go.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.990
We have five times your strength,
double your intelligence.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.032
-Let him go!
-I'll tear out his throat!

37:17.960 --> 37:19.552
Lower your weapons.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.395
Now.

37:31.720 --> 37:32.789
Persis.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.915
I've broken their security code.
We're ready.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.954
I'll kill him!

38:16.040 --> 38:16.995
Persis.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.555
Persis?

38:21.320 --> 38:23.072
I can't believe it.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.318
Father, here's Malik.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.869
Malik.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.869
I knew we'd see each other again.
I'm proud of you.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.119
Of all of you.

38:51.280 --> 38:55.398
-Soong, listen to me.
-There's nothing to say, Captain.

38:55.760 --> 38:59.275
-What should we do with them?
-Let them go.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.356
But they'll just come after us.

39:01.520 --> 39:05.479
Their ship's disabled. By the time
it's repaired, we'll be far away.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.836
It's been a pleasure, Captain.

39:11.440 --> 39:15.558
Take my advice. Go home and
start learning how to speak Klingon.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.594
There were times, back on Earth...

39:39.840 --> 39:41.637
when I doubted myself...

39:42.720 --> 39:43.869
my work.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.192
But seeing you all...

39:48.560 --> 39:51.711
I know that everything
I fought for was worth it.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.749
We're going to build a new world.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.679
But we can't begin that task just yet.

39:58.560 --> 40:02.155
Thousands of your brothers and sisters
are waiting to be born.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.198
Let's go get them.

40:08.305 --> 40:14.377
