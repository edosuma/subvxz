00:00.401 --> 00:04.772
*

00:35.836 --> 00:39.107
[giggling]
Hey. You ready?

00:39.140 --> 00:41.409
Hm?
Ah, all right.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.144
All right.
Secret sign.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.246
Hey. Ryan?

00:45.279 --> 00:46.180
Very good.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.282
Excellent, excellent.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.118
(Dwight)
Michael.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.627
(Michael)
Today, at lunchtime,

00:59.660 --> 01:02.130
we are going to be playing
the warehouse staff

01:02.163 --> 01:03.797
in a friendly little game
of basketball.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.299
My idea.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.634
The last time I was
down there, I noticed

01:06.667 --> 01:08.236
they'd put up
a couple of hoops.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.805
And I play basketball
every weekend,

01:11.839 --> 01:14.108
so I thought, pfff,
this might be kinda fun.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.344
And so I start messin' around.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.346
And, uh, I'm sinkin' a few.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.181
You know?
Swish, swish, swish.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.149
Nothin' but net.

01:21.182 --> 01:25.486
And, uh, their jaws
just drop to the floor.

01:25.519 --> 01:29.190
African-Americans. Um...

01:29.223 --> 01:32.360
But, you know, it's really just,
uh, a good friendly game.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.328
A reason for everybody
to get together.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.664
Pam-Pam,
thank you ma'am!

01:36.697 --> 01:38.299
Messages, please.
Thank you.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.401
Michael, can I talk to you
for a second, please, privately?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.870
Uh...
In your office?

01:42.903 --> 01:46.274
I think I should be
on the team.
No.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.409
[clears throat]
And that's not me
being mean, Dwight.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.910
That is based
on your past behavior.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.944
Oh, please.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.381
When I let him, uh,
come to my pick-up game.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.648
I apologized for that.
I vouched for you.

01:54.682 --> 02:00.321
Michael--
I vouched for you in front
of Todd Packard, Dwight.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.689
[clears throat]

02:01.722 --> 02:04.358
[toy plays jingle]

02:06.494 --> 02:08.462
All right,
here's what I'm gonna do.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.565
The hand strikes
and gives a flower.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.534
You are not going
to play basketball.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.403
Oh.
But...

02:15.436 --> 02:17.371
I need somebody to come in

02:17.405 --> 02:20.374
and take over the holiday
and weekend work calendar.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.476
I can handle that.
Good.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.178
Excellent.
It'll be fun.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.447
Yeah.
Because corporate, uh,

02:26.480 --> 02:29.317
wants somebody to be here
on Saturday, and so we're gonna

02:29.350 --> 02:31.352
have to have a couple of people
come in on the weekends.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.886
And I know nobody's
gonna wanna do it.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.423
And everybody's
gonna complain and bitch,

02:35.456 --> 02:37.291
and I don't wanna have
to deal with it.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.759
And that's why you have
an Assistant Regional Manager.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.262
Yes, it is.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.364
Assistant to
the Regional Manager.
Same thing.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.266
No, it's not.
It's lower, so...

02:45.299 --> 02:46.934
It's close.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.806
So we need someone
to work this Saturday.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.576
And I think
that that should be...

02:55.609 --> 02:56.577
Jim.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.412
God, this is so sad.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.314
This is the smallest
amount of power

03:00.348 --> 03:03.351
I've ever seen go
to someone's head.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.685
Phyllis, can you
believe this?

03:04.718 --> 03:07.588
Keep me out of it.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.891
My fiance has plans
for us this Saturday,

03:10.924 --> 03:13.361
so I really hope Dwight
doesn't make me work.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.896
Maybe I should
sleep with him.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.366
I'm kidding.
[laughs] Kidding.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.733
Totally kidding.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.734
(Michael)
All right.

03:20.768 --> 03:25.439
Managing...by walkin' around!

03:25.473 --> 03:28.276
This is our warehouse,

03:28.309 --> 03:31.512
or, as I like to call it,
the "whoorehouse."

03:31.545 --> 03:33.647
But don't you call it that.
I've earned the right.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.249
Fine.
Don't worry about that.

03:35.283 --> 03:39.620
And here we have
Mitta Roger's neighborhood.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.422
Come on over here.
Hey!

03:41.455 --> 03:44.392
This is Ryan.
He's tempin' upstairs.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.225
What's up?

03:45.259 --> 03:46.727
And this is the foreman,
Mitta Rogers.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.396
That's not my real name.
No.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.665
It's Darryl.
Darryl is Mitta Rogers.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.666
Darryl Rogers?

03:52.700 --> 03:54.802
Darryl Philbin.
Then Regis.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.405
Then Rege. Then Roger.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.341
Then Mitta Rogers...
Then Mitta Rogers.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.942
[laughs]
And that is Lonny.

04:01.975 --> 04:02.943
And this is Roy.

04:02.976 --> 04:03.944
Roy dates Pam.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.679
You know, the, uh,
the best-lookin' one upstairs.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.714
(Ryan)
Yeah, yeah.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.416
You still gettin'
it regular, man?

04:08.449 --> 04:12.720
Huh? I mean, I can tell her
it's part of the job.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.022
Rapport.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.591
No, n-n-no, I know that
the warranty's expired,

04:17.625 --> 04:19.527
but isn't it supposed
to last longer than two years

04:19.560 --> 04:22.530
if it isn't defective?

04:22.563 --> 04:24.598
Okay, fine, three years.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.667
(Jim)
Pam gets a little down.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.369
Her toaster oven broke.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.972
Um, which she got
at her engagement shower,

04:32.005 --> 04:37.911
um, for a wedding that
still has yet to be set.

04:37.945 --> 04:41.315
And that was three years ago.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.984
So! Um, 1:00 sharp
and we've got a game on.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.419
We're loadin' at 1:00.
Oh, I see.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.388
You're, uh,
you're chickenin' out.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.322
You're bailin' on me.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.791
No, we got a truck
goin' out at 1:15, so...

04:50.824 --> 04:52.526
Uh-huh.
That's the busy time.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.962
Oh, well, I'm glad that
some time is a busy time,

04:54.995 --> 05:00.334
because whenever I'm down here,
doesn't seem too busy to me.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.502
[giggling]

05:01.535 --> 05:04.438
[Michael laughing]

05:04.472 --> 05:06.340
Ha huh. Oh.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.009
Oh. You can dish it out,
but you can't take it.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.679
Okay, fine.
Have it your way.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.715
[clucking like chicken]

05:18.919 --> 05:20.454
All right, fine.
You know what?

05:20.488 --> 05:21.455
Huh?
1:00.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.623
[gasps]
All right.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.625
See you at 1:00.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.367
(Michael)
Are we ready for the game?

05:33.401 --> 05:34.702
Yeah.
[groaning]

05:34.735 --> 05:35.736
[imitating groans]
Yeah, I know, grumble, grumble.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.571
But you would follow me
to the ends of the earth,

05:37.605 --> 05:39.106
grumblin' all the way.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.376
Like that, uh, dwarf
from Lord of the Rings.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.544
Gimli.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.679
Nerd. That is why
you're not on the team.

05:45.713 --> 05:46.914
Just tryin'
to be helpful.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.383
[mocking]
I'll help. I'm a dragon slayer.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.819
Uh, ten-point power sword.
Voom! Voom!
That's him.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.522
(Michael)
Okay, so let's put together
a starting lineup,

05:54.555 --> 05:55.656
shall we?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.925
Stanley, of course.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.092
I'm sorry?
Um...

05:59.126 --> 06:00.428
What do you play, center?

06:00.461 --> 06:01.929
Why "of course"?

06:01.962 --> 06:04.865
Uh...
What's that supposed
to mean?

06:04.898 --> 06:07.835
I don't know.
I--I don't remember saying that.

06:07.868 --> 06:08.769
Uh, I heard it.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.071
Well, people hear
a lot of things, man.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.906
Um...

06:12.940 --> 06:16.143
Other starters...
Me, of course.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.478
I heard it that time.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.880
I'd like to play.
If it's just for fun.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.815
I played basketball in school.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.785
Um... Yeah, who else?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.554
We have Jim.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.021
We have Ryan,
the new guy.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.659
All right, untested, willing
to prove himself right now.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.494
A lot of passion,
A lot of heart.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.928
But I'm getting paid
to skip lunch, right?

06:34.962 --> 06:37.164
Yes.
Okay.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.132
Yes, this is business.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.068
The, uh, the business
of team building

06:41.101 --> 06:43.070
and morale boosting.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.438
Ah, who else?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.874
I can help out
if you need me.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.677
I will use your talents
come baseball season, my friend.

06:49.710 --> 06:50.844
Or if we box.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.914
I have a hoop
in my driveway.
No.

06:53.947 --> 06:54.915
I have a sports bra.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.750
No, no! Ridiculous!

06:56.784 --> 06:58.819
Michael, look.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.521
Hoo, hoo, hoo.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.157
[exhales]
Close.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.660
All right, uh, me,
Stan the man,

07:06.694 --> 07:07.895
Jim, Ryan, and Dwight.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.630
Yes!
Sorry, Phyllis.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.599
Can I be team captain?
No, I'm team captain.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.501
Can I be team manager?
No, I am the team manager!

07:13.534 --> 07:14.902
You can be assistant
to the team manager.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.236
Assistant team manager?
No.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.006
Okay, we'll see who's working
this weekend then.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.041
Jim, you're in charge
of the vacation schedule now.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.676
Oh, my God.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.812
Threat neutralized.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.197
(Michael)
Off the backboard!

07:44.231 --> 07:45.866
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.100
Please don't throw
garbage at me.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.069
Oh, Pam with a zinger.
[laughs]

07:49.102 --> 07:53.874
Hey, Pam, how would you like
to be our cheerleader today?

07:53.907 --> 07:56.209
You know?
Some, uh, pigtails.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.079
Little, uh, halter top.
You could tie that up.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.682
And, you know, somethin'
a little just youthful,

08:01.715 --> 08:03.050
for a change,
just this once.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.852
I don't think so, Michael.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.887
Besides, I can't cheer
against my fiance.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.589
(Jim)
I'll do it.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.091
Wear a little flouncy skirt
if you want, and...

08:11.124 --> 08:12.025
Yeah, I bet you would.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.094
Just try not to be
too gay on the court.

08:14.127 --> 08:17.064
And by gay,
I mean, um...

08:17.097 --> 08:20.000
you know, not in
the homosexual way at all.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.234
I mean the, uh,
you know,

08:21.268 --> 08:22.636
like the bad at sports way.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.171
I think that goes
without saying.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.606
(Pam)
Maybe Angela would cheerlead.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.207
(Michael)
Oh, yeah, right.
I'll do it.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.076
Oh, yuck!
That's worse than you playing.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.744
[Michael sighs]

08:30.778 --> 08:33.914
'Cause you know what,
we need you

08:33.947 --> 08:36.316
as an alternate, in case
somebody gets hurt.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.752
That's where we need you.

08:38.786 --> 08:42.089
Blessed be those
who sit and wait.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.191
You made it!

08:44.224 --> 08:46.293
Suit up.
You're on the team!

08:48.696 --> 08:50.764
All right.
Cool!

08:50.798 --> 08:53.100
Very good.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.068
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

08:55.102 --> 08:55.936
It's a spy
from the warehouse.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.671
Tryin' to figure
out our plays, huh, man?

08:57.705 --> 08:58.772
Just gettin' a tea bag.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.140
[laughs]
Ooh.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.842
He's runnin'.
He's runnin'!

09:01.875 --> 09:04.144
He's runnin', but he can't hide,
because you know what?

09:04.177 --> 09:06.146
1:00, you better bring
your "A" game.

09:06.179 --> 09:10.183
Because me and my posse guys
are gonna be in your face.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.084
Right in your face!

09:11.118 --> 09:14.121
Why don't we make
it more interesting?

09:14.154 --> 09:16.056
Loser buys dinner
at Farley's.

09:16.089 --> 09:19.126
Oh-ho, I like
the way you think.
Yeah.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.894
You know what, I'm gonna
take that one step further.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.964
Loser works on Saturday.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.167
No...

09:27.200 --> 09:28.235
That's not as much fun.

09:28.268 --> 09:31.705
[clucking]

09:31.739 --> 09:32.840
You know what?

09:32.873 --> 09:33.941
Oh! What?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.876
You on.
Okay.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.611
Cool!

09:37.645 --> 09:39.179
You're on.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.816
[clucking]
Don't screw this up.

09:50.257 --> 09:54.227
Classic beginner's mistake,
eating before a game. Tck!

09:54.261 --> 09:55.996
[Michael clears throat]

10:09.209 --> 10:11.244
Has anyone seen
the first aid kit?

10:13.747 --> 10:15.749
How many times
have I told you?

10:15.783 --> 10:16.950
I'm the safety officer.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.252
Not you.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.240
Basketball was kinda my thing
in high school.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.276
And I'm--Yeah.
I'm looking forward to playing.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.813
You know, I think I'm gonna
impress a few people in here.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.715
(Jim)
You comin' down?

10:47.748 --> 10:48.816
Yeah, I'm just
forwarding the phones.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.450
You gonna wish me luck?

10:50.483 --> 10:53.053
Yeah, you're gonna need it.
Whoa.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.055
Is that trash talk
from Pam?

10:55.088 --> 10:57.858
I'm just saying,
Roy is very competitive.
Oh.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.192
And he wants to take
the waverunners

10:59.226 --> 11:01.328
to the lake
this Saturday, so...
Wow.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.698
Well, I'm goin' to
the outlet mall on Saturday.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.835
So if you wanna save
big on brand names

11:07.868 --> 11:09.102
and Roy has to work,

11:09.136 --> 11:12.906
which he will,
because I'm also competitive,

11:12.940 --> 11:14.775
you should feel free
to come along.

11:14.808 --> 11:19.747
Um, I think I'm gonna be
up at the lake.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.115
I think I'll see
you at the mall.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.416
Yeah.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.786
[laughs]

11:25.819 --> 11:28.255
[door opens]

11:28.288 --> 11:29.256
Hey.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.959
There he is.
Secret weapon!

11:31.992 --> 11:33.693
[clapping]

11:39.199 --> 11:41.034
(Michael)
All right, you guys.
Come on.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.203
Let's bring it in.
Here we go.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.106
Okay.

11:46.139 --> 11:49.877
Listen, this is just going
to be a friendly game, right?

11:49.910 --> 11:52.045
We are all
on the same team here.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.181
The Dunder Mifflin team.

11:54.214 --> 11:58.118
Of course, if you
beat us, you're fired.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.853
That's a joke.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.122
[Michael laughs]

12:02.155 --> 12:03.223
Okay!

12:03.256 --> 12:05.392
Let's do it!

12:05.425 --> 12:06.459
Have a good game, man.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.796
Yeah, you too.
Should be fun.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.030
All right, everybody,
stretch out a little bit.

12:10.063 --> 12:10.964
Stretch it.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.366
Full stretch.
Ryan, you want to stretch?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.235
I stretched
before I came.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.539
Okay, Ryan, you have Darryl.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.074
I have Roy.
Really?

12:21.108 --> 12:22.342
I thought
I'd take Roy.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.211
No, actually,
I think Roy's

12:24.244 --> 12:25.813
their best player,
not Lonny.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.147
So Dwight,

12:27.180 --> 12:29.950
you have
the East German gal.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.325
Um, okay.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.927
All right, you guys?

12:39.960 --> 12:40.928
Okay, we'll be skins.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.196
Oh, come on, Dwight.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.364
What?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.233
Shirts, on or off?
On. Just put it on.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.101
You sure?
Yes.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.170
Pam, you kind of have
your foot in both camps here.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.172
Why don't you do
the jump ball, okay?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.506
Don't listen
to him, Pam.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.843
Trust me. Tip it my way
or you're sleeping in the car.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.780
Stanley!

13:02.582 --> 13:04.084
What?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.219
You gotta be kidding me!

13:08.555 --> 13:10.290
Here we go!

13:10.323 --> 13:11.291
Who's on him?
Who's on him?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.193
Somebody get him!

13:13.226 --> 13:14.227
That's what
I'm talking about.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.231
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.933
Over here!
Over here!

13:19.967 --> 13:21.168
Three!

13:21.201 --> 13:23.603
Let's go to zone.
Let's go in the zone!

13:23.636 --> 13:26.239
Defense!
Defense!

13:26.273 --> 13:29.142
(team)
Defense. [clapping]
Defense. [clapping]

13:30.643 --> 13:33.146
(Michael)
Who's got him?
Who's on Roy?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.389
Whoo!

13:45.192 --> 13:46.159
Oh, come on!

13:46.193 --> 13:49.496
What is wrong with me today?
Usually hit those.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.304
Dwight, I was open.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.907
All right, let's go.

14:05.212 --> 14:05.979
Oh.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.982
Okay, foul.
Charging. Charging.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.251
That's a foul.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.286
(Michael)
Okay, I'll take it.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.677
When I am playing hoops,

14:37.710 --> 14:40.013
all of the stress
and responsibility

14:40.047 --> 14:41.915
of my job here
just melts away.

14:41.949 --> 14:42.950
It's gone.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.051
Three!

14:44.084 --> 14:45.685
I'm in the zone.
What's with me today?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.921
Who am I?
Am I Michael Scott?

14:47.955 --> 14:50.190
I don't know.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.624
I might just be
a basketball machine.

14:51.658 --> 14:55.162
What's Dunder Mifflin?
I've never heard of it.

14:55.195 --> 14:55.929
Filing, paperwork?

14:55.963 --> 14:59.099
Who cares?
Possible downsizing.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.301
Um...

15:01.334 --> 15:03.336
Well, that's--that's probably
going to happen, actually.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.405
Jim! Jim! Jim!
Right here!

15:05.438 --> 15:07.274
Jim, give me the ball.
Ryan, cut.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.343
My bad.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.449
Here we go.
They don't want
none of that.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.985
There you go.
There you go.
Uh, uh, uh.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.686
Where you at?
Where you at? Where you at?
Uh. Oh.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.621
You over there?
I'm over here.
Yeah. Mm.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.190
Here. Uh.
That is cool.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.226
Is that like the robot?

15:28.261 --> 15:29.262
[cheers]

15:29.296 --> 15:31.264
Come here.
There's no free throws.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.001
Can we just do one?
That's cool. That's fine.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.268
All right, let's go.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.305
(Michael)
Don't get hurt.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.040
Back off, man!

15:40.073 --> 15:42.675
Come on!
Hey, Dwight. Dwight.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.514
Yeah!
In your face!

15:47.547 --> 15:49.149
Yeah, like that counted.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.550
Hey! Hey, you know what?
Dwight. Dwight.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.085
Football is like
rock and roll.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.987
It's just * buh buh boo

15:54.021 --> 15:56.256
And basketball
is like Jazz, you know?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.525
You're kind of
* doop be doo

15:58.558 --> 16:01.028
* doop be doo
It's all down beat.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.462
It's in the pocket.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.032
It's like * blee dee dee
bloo doo doo blah da da *

16:05.065 --> 16:08.568
["Sweet Georgia Brown"]
* Do do do do do do do

16:08.601 --> 16:12.772
* Do do do do do

16:12.805 --> 16:13.773
Harlem Globetrotter.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.243
[humming to himself]

16:20.247 --> 16:22.382
* Doot doo doo doo doo doo
Your ball.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.117
(Michael)
All right, time.
Time out.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.753
Come on, sales.
Over here.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.156
Bring it in!
Come on!

16:29.189 --> 16:31.324
What's goin' on?
What is goin' on?

16:31.358 --> 16:32.759
You guys are playing
like a bunch of girls.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.095
You know what,
let me take Roy.
All right, we'll switch.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.197
Take it up a notch.
Come on.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.745
(Dwight)
Shoot it. Shoot it.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.614
[smack]

16:54.647 --> 16:56.249
(Michael)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:56.283 --> 16:58.485
Foul. Naked aggression.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.720
Oh, that is...

17:00.753 --> 17:02.555
You all right, Jim?
Suck it up.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.458
He's afraid of you now.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.828
(Michael)
Ouch!

17:08.861 --> 17:09.829
Oh, how much
does it hurt?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.365
How much
does it hurt?

17:25.245 --> 17:26.213
(Michael)
Yes!

17:26.246 --> 17:28.381
What the hell, man?

17:28.415 --> 17:29.382
Take it easy.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.750
No, you take it easy.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.157
Watch the long passes,
you guys.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.329
Same team, Dwight.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.330
(Michael)
Dwight.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.697
Yes!

17:47.500 --> 17:49.836
(Michael)
Yeah! Yeah!

17:49.869 --> 17:51.271
Yeah!

17:51.304 --> 17:53.373
In your face!

17:53.406 --> 17:55.842
Hazel,
what's the score?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.244
You're ahead.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.346
Yeah, baby!
Here we go!

17:59.379 --> 18:00.880
Jim. Jim.
Right here.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.649
Ow, God!

18:02.682 --> 18:05.452
Okay! Foul! Foul!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.486
You all right?
God!

18:06.519 --> 18:07.520
Oh, that hurts.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.322
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What's your problem, man?

18:09.356 --> 18:10.757
I didn't mean to do--
God!

18:10.790 --> 18:12.559
Just clocking me
for no reason.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.294
(Roger)
Take your shot, man.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.728
No, no, no, no.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.464
That was a flagrant
personal intentional foul.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.465
Right there.
No, it wasn't.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.633
Yes, it was. You know what,
I'm just being fair.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.402
No, really, you were
bearing down on me.
No, no, no, no.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.371
I just put my arm up--
Game over! Game over!
Game over!

18:24.404 --> 18:26.806
(Michael)
That is it.
I'm sorry, you know?

18:26.839 --> 18:29.376
I hate to do it this way,
but, you know,

18:29.409 --> 18:30.577
that's just--

18:30.610 --> 18:32.345
We were having
a friendly game.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.714
It's a shame.
This is a damn shame.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.283
But, you know,
we're like a family here

18:36.316 --> 18:37.184
and that's just--
that won't fly.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.419
This is a cold pack.
Here, give me that.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.455
You have to break
the interior bag.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.456
Thanks, Dwight.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.192
Wait, what does that mean?

18:45.225 --> 18:46.893
What is it, a tie?
What's going on?

18:46.926 --> 18:49.496
Well, let's just say
whoever was ahead won.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.597
That was you.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.265
That was us, really?

18:52.299 --> 18:53.600
I didn't--I didn't know.

18:53.633 --> 18:58.705
Great. I mean, I guess
you guys working Saturday.

18:58.738 --> 18:59.939
Your face.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.309
No, no, no.
I'm not coming in on Saturday.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.876
Yeah,
this isn't happening.

19:03.910 --> 19:07.347
Uh...

19:07.380 --> 19:09.749
Well, guys, you know...

19:09.782 --> 19:11.684
I am the boss.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.453
So what--what's that?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.322
We--we coming in
on Monday, right?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.962
Monday?

19:22.995 --> 19:26.666
You guys believed me?

19:26.699 --> 19:28.701
Come on.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.370
Dawgs, you know,

19:30.403 --> 19:34.374
you should know me
better than that.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.676
Do you think that would've
been good for morale?

19:36.709 --> 19:38.311
No. No. No.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.513
Exactly. No.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.948
I'm embarrassed
it was even that close.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.417
No, of course,
we're coming in Saturday.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.855
(Roy)
Good game.

19:48.888 --> 19:52.292
Word.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.623
So I talked to this gal.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.991
Looks good.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.693
I haven't signed anything.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.927
Hey, baby.
Hey.

20:27.960 --> 20:32.265
Look at Larry Bird.
Larry legend.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.301
Yeah, he's, uh,
he's pretty good, huh?

20:34.334 --> 20:39.539
Let's get you into a tub.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.873
Yeah, let's get you
in a tub.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.476
[Pam laughing]

20:45.645 --> 20:46.846
Hey!

20:46.879 --> 20:50.016
What a game, huh?
What a game.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.684
What time
do we have to come in?

20:51.718 --> 20:54.354
Come on.
Let's not be gloomy here, man.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.523
We're all in this together.
We're a team.

21:01.060 --> 21:05.732
You know what?
Screw corporate.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.634
Nobody's coming in tomorrow.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.402
You have the day off.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.804
Like coming in an extra day
is going to prevent us

21:11.838 --> 21:13.606
from being downsized.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.408
Have a good weekend.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.311
The great thing
about sports

21:18.345 --> 21:22.715
is that it is all
about character.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.652
And you can learn lessons
about life

21:25.685 --> 21:28.521
even if you don't win.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.623
But we did because
we were ahead.
