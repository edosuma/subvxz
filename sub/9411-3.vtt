[ Man ]
Viewer beware.

00:24.967 --> 00:26.967
You're in for a scare.

00:29.467 --> 00:30.700
Goosebumps.

00:33.133 --> 00:37.667
- [ Girl ] How long has he been in there?
- [ Boy ] Exactly 10 minutes and 31 seconds.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.667
I have to admit.
He's got guts.

00:41.167 --> 00:44.667
Looks like Danger Inc. is
gonna have a new member.

00:44.667 --> 00:46.267
Not so fast, Nathan.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.700
Doug's gotta stay in there
for a whole hour.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.200
He's still got

00:51.200 --> 00:54.700
48 minutes and 54 seconds to go.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.200
No one's ever made it
past 5 minutes.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.867
He's probably in there
taking a nap.

01:00.867 --> 01:02.167
[ Dog Barking ]

01:03.167 --> 01:05.000
[ Nathan ]
Hey, give me some more seeds.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.733
- I just gave you a whole handful.
- I ate them.

01:09.733 --> 01:10.933
[ Thudding ]

01:10.933 --> 01:12.467
What was that?

01:13.900 --> 01:16.400
- Time?
- He just told us.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.933
I'm not waiting out here
a whole hour.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.933
[ Nathan ]
Hey, what're you doing?

01:22.933 --> 01:26.933
- You can't let him out.
- Let's admit it. Doug's not scared.

01:27.433 --> 01:28.133
No, no, no.

01:28.567 --> 01:30.900
Doug has to stay in there
for the whole hour.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.567
- If he makes it, then he's in.
- I hope he doesn't make it.

01:34.567 --> 01:36.633
- I don't even like him.
- Neither do I.

01:36.633 --> 01:38.133
Well, I don't either.

01:38.133 --> 01:39.633
But if he makes it,
we're stuck with him.

01:40.133 --> 01:43.000
I just wanna look inside,
see what he's doing.

02:26.267 --> 02:28.033
Help! Something's in here.

02:28.033 --> 02:29.300

Somebody help me.

Let me out. Let me out.

02:31.733 --> 02:33.133
[ Screams ]

02:34.133 --> 02:36.200
It touched me!
It touched my face!

Stay away, you guys.
It's in there.

[ Imitating Doug ]
It touched me! It touched my face!

- [ All Chuckle ]
- Oh, I knew he wouldn't make it.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.233
They never do.

02:50.233 --> 02:51.733
Good thing.
Could you imagine

02:51.733 --> 02:53.833
if we had to let him into Danger Inc.?

02:53.833 --> 02:57.133
- Why do we have to let anybody in?
- Because we only have 3 members.

02:57.133 --> 03:01.167
- Yeah, but there're only 3 stooges.
- But that wasn't a corporation.

03:01.167 --> 03:03.233
A corporation should
have a lot of members.

03:03.233 --> 03:05.233
[ Lori ] I guess we have to
look for another victim.

03:05.233 --> 03:08.000
- Someone cool...
- And brave.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.433
Someone who won't freak out
in an empty old house.

03:10.433 --> 03:13.100
Isn't there one brave kid
in this stupid town?

03:14.100 --> 03:16.300
Besides us, of course.

03:16.733 --> 03:19.167
[ Lori ] "It touched my face."
What do you think he meant?

03:19.167 --> 03:21.233
Oh, he probably just walked
into a cobweb or somethin'.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.667
- What a chicken.
- [ Door Banging ]

03:30.367 --> 03:32.267
Hey, where's my money?

03:34.233 --> 03:35.833
I had $5 right here.

03:35.833 --> 03:38.400
Maybe it fell out while we were
shoving Doug into the house.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.233
Yeah, it's probably up on the porch.

03:40.733 --> 03:42.733
I'd to work hard to get that $5.

03:44.733 --> 03:45.967
[ Dog Barking ]

03:47.433 --> 03:48.367
[ Banging ]

03:48.367 --> 03:50.300
Why don't you guys
help me look for it?

03:50.300 --> 03:53.533
- Oh, just go get it.
- Yeah, don't be a baby.

04:09.033 --> 04:10.533
Oh, great.

- Would you hurry up?
- I'm coming!

Wait up!

04:35.467 --> 04:37.600
[ Woman ] But this is
your new neighborhood.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.100
Don't you wanna explore it?

04:39.600 --> 04:41.600
- Not really.
- Sure you do.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.100
Who knows,

04:43.100 --> 04:45.600
you might even
meet some new friends here.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.100
C'mon, just take a walk,

04:48.100 --> 04:50.600
and when you get back,
I'll make you some lunch.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.467
Why don't you
just drive me around?

04:53.467 --> 04:54.833

04:54.833 --> 04:57.300
Will you make me a cheeseburger
when I get back?

04:57.300 --> 04:59.167
- OK.
- With bacon.

- All right. See you, Mom.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.667
- Hey, check it out.
- He's that new kid.

05:22.667 --> 05:25.167
Yeah, and he probably
doesn't have any friends.

05:25.167 --> 05:29.167
No friends.
The perfect candidate for Danger Inc.

05:29.167 --> 05:31.667
I don't know.
He doesn't look very brave.

05:31.667 --> 05:34.167
If you're in danger inc.,
you have to be brave.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.167
True.
But if he's not,

05:37.167 --> 05:38.500
it'll sure be fun scarin' him.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.633
Hey.

05:40.633 --> 05:43.833
- Your name's Chris, right?
- Yeah, Chris Wakely.

- Hi.
- Listen. You're new in town. Right?

05:51.767 --> 05:53.133
Yeah, just moved in last week.

05:53.633 --> 05:55.667
So, you're probably lookin'
for some new friends,

05:55.667 --> 05:58.100
- someone to hang out with.
- Sure. That'd be great.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.600
- Do you wanna join our organization?
- Danger Inc.

06:01.100 --> 06:05.600
- We have room for one more member.
- Danger Inc., what is it?

06:05.600 --> 06:09.200
- It's a club for brave people.
- Oh, well, I'm not very brave.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.567
You like horror movies,
don't you?

06:12.200 --> 06:15.500
No, actually I cover my eyes
during the scary parts.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.800
- [ Both Chuckles ]
- Well, you don't have to be that brave.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.700
- Just have to do one thing.
- What's that?

06:24.133 --> 06:26.900
- [ Bird Cawing ]
- [ Nathan ] Just one hour.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.367
If you can make it
for one hour, you're in.

06:29.367 --> 06:32.367
[ Robbie ] They call it
the House of No Return.

06:32.867 --> 06:33.867
[ Chris ]
Why?

06:37.367 --> 06:40.367
Years ago, a young couple
moved into town.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.833
A beautiful young woman
and her husband.

06:43.833 --> 06:47.333
[ Robbie ] He built this house for her.
Their dream house.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.733
A place to raise their child.

06:51.067 --> 06:54.267
But he made a mistake in
the construction of the house.

06:54.267 --> 06:56.833
Their child broke through
a weak spot in the floor...

06:56.833 --> 06:58.767
and fell to her death.

06:58.767 --> 07:02.800
The couple were so sad,
they slowly went mad.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.800
- [ Thunder Rumbling ]
- Days, weeks, months went by,

07:06.800 --> 07:09.067
and the couple
never came outside.

07:09.567 --> 07:11.567
One day, the police came.

07:11.567 --> 07:14.933
They entered the house.
The couple were dead.

07:15.333 --> 07:18.667
Their bodies were taken away,
and the house was sealed up.

07:18.667 --> 07:23.167
[ Robbie ] Days later, children from
the neighborhood started to disappear.

07:23.167 --> 07:24.967
[ Nathan ]
Some say they were kidnapped.

07:24.967 --> 07:26.967
Others say the ghosts
of the couple took them.

07:27.467 --> 07:29.000
But it's probably just
an empty old house.

07:29.567 --> 07:31.900
So go on in, Chris. And then
you can be our new member.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.133
- [ Chris ] I don't think so.
- Come on, we'll be right out here.

07:35.567 --> 07:38.733
- Have you done it?
- Uh, done what?

07:39.233 --> 07:40.667
Stayed in there for one hour.

07:41.167 --> 07:45.000
- Well, no, but...
- But-- well, we-- we don't have to.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.967
See, 'cause, uh,
w-we started the organization.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.900
[ Nathan ]
We already know we like danger.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.000
It's our middle name.

07:52.500 --> 07:56.000
- [ Nathan ] Come on, man.
- We think you're a real cool guy.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.933
We want you in our club.
Huh, Robbie?

07:57.933 --> 07:59.700
You the man, Chris.

08:00.933 --> 08:03.367
That's great.
But I don't think so.

[ Robbie ]
Danger Inc. is now in session.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.533
Is there any new business?

08:11.033 --> 08:12.533
[ TV Playing ]

08:13.033 --> 08:15.033
You mean,
there's no new business?

08:15.533 --> 08:18.033
This is the most boring
meeting I've been in.

08:18.533 --> 08:21.033
What're you talking about?
They're all boring.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.033
We need a new member.

08:24.033 --> 08:25.933
[ Laughing ]

08:25.933 --> 08:29.633
We haven't had a new member since
you started this stupid organization.

08:31.367 --> 08:34.866
You know, that Chris has a lot
of nerve turning us down.

08:34.866 --> 08:38.200
Yeah.
He is kind of stuck up, isn't he?

08:38.200 --> 08:41.366
Yeah, new kid.
I'm a chicken, la-di-da.

08:41.366 --> 08:44.833
[ Lori Chuckles ]
Maybe we should teach him a lesson.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.833
Yeah.

How to be brave.

09:00.267 --> 09:02.767

- For me?

09:02.767 --> 09:04.267
Someone named Robbie.

09:08.267 --> 09:09.767
Hello?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.267
Yeah, sure.
That'd be great.

09:13.267 --> 09:15.267
All right, I'll see you there.

09:15.267 --> 09:16.767
OK. Bye.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.267

09:19.267 --> 09:21.767
Yeah, it's this kid
I met down the street.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.767
He's got 2 friends,
Lori and Nathan.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.767
They want me to go hang out
with them at the mall.

09:25.767 --> 09:28.200
Well, I'm glad you're making
some new friends already.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.700
Yeah. Maybe this place isn't
as bad as I thought it was.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.700
You see? I told you.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.200
All right.
I'm gonna walk over to Robbie's.

- Yeah, Mom?

- They're nice kids?
- Yeah, they're all right.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.700
I don't think they're too smart,
but they're OK.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.200
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.200
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Mom.

09:49.633 --> 09:51.833
- [ Owl Hooting ]
- [ Chris ] So, is this a cool mall?

09:51.833 --> 09:54.333
[ Robbie ]
Yeah, it's cool all right.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.333
This way.

09:58.833 --> 10:02.267
- This must be a short cut, right?
- [ All ] Yeah.

10:02.267 --> 10:03.667

10:05.667 --> 10:07.167
Are you sure
this is the way to the mall?

10:07.667 --> 10:10.167
Listen to this,

10:22.467 --> 10:23.967
Let's cross the street, all right?

10:24.467 --> 10:26.733
- Why?
- That place freaks me out.

- Now!
- What are you--

- [ Robbie ] Come on!

Don't worry, Chris.

in there for a whole hour.

- Open up, come on, open up.
- There's someone in here.

- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- No, it's just his imagination.

12:17.267 --> 12:18.767
[ Dog Barking ]

12:23.333 --> 12:24.833
All right, Chris.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.200
Calm down.
Old houses make noises.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.133
That's just what old houses do.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.300
[ Lori ]
Do you think he's OK?

12:35.500 --> 12:36.933
Hmm...

12:49.433 --> 12:50.800
[ Door Creaking ]

12:52.733 --> 12:55.733
Hello? Is anybody there?

12:57.233 --> 12:58.233
[ Door Creaks ]

13:01.700 --> 13:05.033
- Hello?
- [ Bat Screeching ]

13:06.400 --> 13:07.867
[ Grunts ]

13:09.233 --> 13:10.667
Go away.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.167
I'm just gonna stand here
against this wall.

13:19.167 --> 13:21.667
That way,
nothing can sneak up on me.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.667
I'm just gonna stand here.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.400
I think he gave up.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.900
He already stayed in there
longer than anyone ever did.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.567
I guess he's gonna be
our new member.

13:39.567 --> 13:43.267
Hey. Chris has got a
long time to go, all right?

13:43.267 --> 13:44.700
A long time.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.700
45 more minutes.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.700
[ Sighs ]

13:51.200 --> 13:53.200
[ Whistling ]

13:53.700 --> 13:55.800
[ Clinking ]

13:59.267 --> 14:00.600
[ Gasps ]

14:24.100 --> 14:25.500
[ Gasps ]

14:30.633 --> 14:32.033
[ Thudding ]

14:35.667 --> 14:39.867
Beware of the House of No Return.

14:53.467 --> 14:55.800
[ Voices ]
Don't be afraid, dear child.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.567
We're coming. We're coming.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.300
We're coming for you.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.633
[ Grunts ]

15:13.133 --> 15:16.367
- C'mon.
- We're coming. We're coming.

15:16.367 --> 15:18.867
We're coming for you.

15:22.733 --> 15:24.567
[ Floorboards Creaking ]

15:24.567 --> 15:26.800
We're here.

15:29.633 --> 15:31.433
[ Screaming ]

15:31.867 --> 15:32.367
What?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.067
Nothing. I just wanted
to make sure you were awake.

15:35.067 --> 15:38.000
- Real funny.
- What time is it anyway?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.900
- [ Dog Barking ]
- 5 more seconds.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.220
4, 3, 2, 1.

15:45.367 --> 15:47.200
Let's go get him.

15:50.967 --> 15:52.467
All right, Chris. You made it!

15:52.467 --> 15:54.467
You're now a member of Danger Inc.

15:55.467 --> 15:57.600
Hey, Chris! Open up.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.600
- [ Lori ] What's he doing?
- I don't know.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.267
- Chris!
- [ Banging ]

16:02.267 --> 16:05.733
- Open up!
- What should we do?

16:05.733 --> 16:08.133
Break the door down.
Ready?

16:08.133 --> 16:11.433
On 3. 1, 2,

16:11.867 --> 16:13.867
- 3.
- [ Both Grunting ]

16:14.367 --> 16:17.000
Again! 1, 2,

16:17.000 --> 16:17.733
3!

16:18.167 --> 16:19.667
[ Thudding ]

16:23.667 --> 16:26.167
Hey, check this out.

16:26.167 --> 16:28.167
Why would Chris board up the door?

16:29.167 --> 16:32.633
- Maybe he didn't.
- What is that supposed to mean?

16:33.100 --> 16:34.533
I don't know.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.033
Chris?

16:38.533 --> 16:40.533
Chris!

16:42.833 --> 16:47.333
- Man, this is getting weird.
- He's probably playing a trick on us.

16:47.833 --> 16:50.900
- Chris?
- Yo, Chris!

16:56.200 --> 16:58.667
Well, he's probably just hiding.

16:58.667 --> 17:01.167
H-he's probably behind
that bookcase over there.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.500
He couldn't move that by himself.

17:05.933 --> 17:07.433
Yeah.

17:24.032 --> 17:26.532
Hey, how about in there?

17:26.532 --> 17:28.532
Why don't you go check it out?

17:28.532 --> 17:31.533
- Uh, alone?
- [ Whispers ] I'll go with you.

17:39.300 --> 17:42.667
- [ Door Creaking ]
- H-h-hey, wait, wait. I'll come, too.

17:45.833 --> 17:49.333
- [ Thunder Clapping ]
- Well, he's not in here.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.833
If he's playing a trick on us...

17:51.833 --> 17:53.833
You mean, like
the one we played on him?

17:54.333 --> 17:55.633
Huh?

17:57.967 --> 17:59.967
Come on, let's keep looking.

18:04.567 --> 18:07.900
Chris! Come on out.
This isn't funny anymore.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.633
You got us good, Chris.
Now come on!

18:10.633 --> 18:12.233
[ Groaning ]

18:12.667 --> 18:16.200
- Robbie.
- What? What is it?

18:19.733 --> 18:21.933
That is too weird.

18:22.433 --> 18:27.167
Well, Chris probably did that while
we were in the other room.

18:27.633 --> 18:30.533
- [ Man's Voice ] I don't think so.
- Hello? Who said that?

18:30.533 --> 18:31.900
I did.

18:32.433 --> 18:35.033
Chris? Is that you?

18:37.167 --> 18:38.867
[ Panting ]

18:39.267 --> 18:40.967
[ Grunting ]

18:42.667 --> 18:45.700
[ Woman's Voice ]
That won't do you any good.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.533
[ Voices ] We're coming down.

19:10.667 --> 19:15.100
Children. My children.

19:15.667 --> 19:19.467
Welcome...
To the House of No Return.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.433
[ Gasps ]

19:30.233 --> 19:32.133
Wh-where's Chris?

19:32.800 --> 19:34.733
- He left.
- Left?

19:35.200 --> 19:38.467
- Out the back door.
- We didn't want him to leave, did we?

19:38.467 --> 19:41.500
Oh, no.
We wanted him to stay.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.933
We love children.
But he made a deal with us.

19:45.433 --> 19:48.033
A deal?
What kind of a deal?

19:48.033 --> 19:51.467
A very good deal.
A real bargain. Oh, yes.

19:51.467 --> 19:53.367
C-c-can we make a deal?

19:53.367 --> 19:55.233
Oh, you could never make
the kind of deal he made.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.800
- Very pleasing to my wife.
- [ Chuckles ]

19:58.200 --> 20:01.567
- [ Thunder Rumbling ]
- What kind of a ba-- bargain was it?

20:01.567 --> 20:07.500
He promised that if we let him go,
3 children would take his place.

20:07.500 --> 20:11.233
3-for-1 trade.
3 children.

20:11.233 --> 20:14.133
And you know
how much we love children.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.667
Now we have 3 more.

20:16.667 --> 20:19.967
He promised you'd come,
and here you are.

20:19.967 --> 20:24.100
- Right on schedule.
- Wh-what're you gonna do to us?

20:24.100 --> 20:27.700
- A-are you gonna let us go?
- Let you go?

20:27.700 --> 20:30.833
We can't let you go.
We're a family now.

20:31.267 --> 20:34.600
- We love you.
- And we're going to love you

20:35.467 --> 20:36.867
forever.

20:36.867 --> 20:38.800
- Forever.
- Forever.

- Forever.
