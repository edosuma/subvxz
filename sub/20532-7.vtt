00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.543 --> 00:12.511
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.513 --> 00:14.880
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.882 --> 00:17.616
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:19.385
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.387 --> 00:22.554
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.556 --> 00:25.290
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.292 --> 00:29.495
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.497 --> 00:32.698
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:32.700 --> 00:36.668
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.670 --> 00:38.170
¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:38.172 --> 00:41.573
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:41.575 --> 00:42.908
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.910 --> 00:45.477
-¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
-¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.479 --> 00:51.550
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the First ¶

00:57.591 --> 00:59.458
¶¶

01:02.430 --> 01:04.596
Bye, Vivian!
See you at school.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.664
( horse neighs )

01:07.601 --> 01:09.768
Crackle, you
dropped something.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.637
Oh, thanks, Sofia.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.774
Are you sure you want
to throw this away?

01:15.776 --> 01:17.176
It looks like
an invitation!

01:17.178 --> 01:20.245
It is! For a really
fantastic party.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.613
But you love parties!

01:21.615 --> 01:23.348
How come you're
not even opening this?

01:23.350 --> 01:26.385
You want me to open it?
Okay, I'll open it.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.954
"You are invited
to this year's

01:28.956 --> 01:31.023
Dragon Roast 'n' Toast."

01:31.025 --> 01:32.124
That sounds fun!

01:32.126 --> 01:33.692
How could it
not be fun?

01:33.694 --> 01:37.129
It's a giant picnic
for dragons from every kingdom!

01:37.131 --> 01:39.765
It says they do things like
show off fire-breathing tricks.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.033
And sing
dragon songs.

01:41.035 --> 01:42.434
And do flying stunts.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.136
And have the best time
they've ever had

01:44.138 --> 01:45.571
in their entire lives!

01:45.573 --> 01:47.372
It sounds like
you really want

01:47.374 --> 01:48.807
to go
to the Roast 'n' Toast.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.643
Oh, I do.
I really do, Sofia.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.112
Then why don't
you just go?

01:53.114 --> 01:54.813
Because everyone
is supposed to come

01:54.815 --> 01:56.782
with their very
best dragon buddy,

01:56.784 --> 01:58.217
and I don't have
a dragon buddy,

01:58.219 --> 01:59.384
so I can't go.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.753
You don't have
one single dragon friend?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.589
I knew a lot of dragons
when I was a kid,

02:03.591 --> 02:07.793
but back then I was shy
and, well, I just never
clicked with anyone.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.294
But you're not shy anymore!

02:09.296 --> 02:11.630
I'm sure if you went
to this Roast 'n' Toast

02:11.632 --> 02:13.065
you'd make tons of friends!

02:13.067 --> 02:15.667
Maybe, but I can't go!
Not without a buddy.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.970
-I'll go with you.
-But only dragons are allowed.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.671
Then I'll be
your dragon buddy.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.573
I wish to be a dragon.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.077
How did you do that?

02:25.079 --> 02:26.979
My amulet lets me
turn into animals.

02:26.981 --> 02:30.616
And it also
lets you be the most
amazing friend ever!

02:30.618 --> 02:31.650
Thank you, Sofia!

02:31.652 --> 02:33.185
I wish to be myself again.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.820
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!

02:34.822 --> 02:36.188
So, when is the picnic?

02:36.190 --> 02:38.423
Tomorrow, in the Kingdom
of Brazendell.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.025
Can you meet me here
bright and early?

02:40.027 --> 02:42.628
Sure. I'll just tell
my parents where we're headed.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.996
Great! We can
fly over together,

02:43.998 --> 02:45.864
and I'll teach you
some dragon songs

02:45.866 --> 02:46.965
and fire tricks
on the way.

02:46.967 --> 02:47.966
See you tomorrow!

02:47.968 --> 02:50.836
( neighs )

02:52.173 --> 02:54.673
Let's try our fire shapes
one last time.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.375
Just pucker up
and blow!

02:56.377 --> 02:58.277
( pfft )

02:58.279 --> 03:00.779
Look! I got
some smoke that time.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.181
Achoo!

03:04.151 --> 03:06.885
Wow, Crackle,
your fire shapes
are really great.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.154
Thanks! Hey, you think
that'll impress

03:09.156 --> 03:11.890
the other dragons
and help me get some friends?

03:11.892 --> 03:14.159
Um, I'm not sure
that's how you make friends.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.661
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.863
I've gotta do something
really impressive.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.898
I know! When we do
our flying tricks,

03:19.900 --> 03:22.034
I'll do a quadruple
loop-de-spin!

03:22.036 --> 03:24.870
I've never done it before,
but you spin like this,

03:24.872 --> 03:27.172
then loop like that,
and then again like-- Whoa!

03:27.174 --> 03:29.575
( grunts )

03:29.577 --> 03:31.677
I just showed you
how not to do it.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.378
What is this thing,
anyway?

03:33.380 --> 03:35.981
I think it's decoration
for the Roast 'n' Toast.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.816
Look down below!

03:37.818 --> 03:39.184
We're here, Sofia!

03:39.186 --> 03:41.320
-Yippee!
-Let's go!

03:44.592 --> 03:48.060
Wow, I've never seen
so many dragons before.

03:48.062 --> 03:51.430
Look, there's Smokelee!
And Willawing!

03:51.432 --> 03:52.864
Let's go say hi.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.700
Wait, wait, wait.
You can't!

03:54.702 --> 03:56.735
You're supposed to be
Dragon Sofia,

03:56.737 --> 03:58.370
who they've
never met before.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.038
Oh, right.
Then I won't wave

04:00.040 --> 04:02.374
to Nitelite
over there, either.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.777
( sighs ) I can't believe
you have more dragon friends
than I do!

04:05.779 --> 04:07.913
Well, let's do
something about that.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.881
Why don't you go up
to someone and say hi?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.017
Okay. Um...

04:13.887 --> 04:15.187
( laughter )

04:15.189 --> 04:16.455
( clears throat )

04:16.457 --> 04:18.190
Hello, my name's--

04:18.192 --> 04:21.727
-( high-pitched vocal note )
-What's that?

04:21.729 --> 04:24.196
It's not a what,
it's a who.

04:24.198 --> 04:25.931
-Look, there she is!
-Sizzle!

04:25.933 --> 04:28.767
-What a star!
-Wait, all my friends.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.803
I've got more
to show you. Watch this!

04:31.805 --> 04:34.206
-( high-pitched vocal note )
-( applause )

04:34.208 --> 04:36.541
That's Sizzle.
When we were kids,

04:36.543 --> 04:38.543
she was the star
of every show,

04:38.545 --> 04:39.811
had the widest wingspan,

04:39.813 --> 04:41.913
knew all the best
fire tricks...

04:41.915 --> 04:45.250
and she also had
the most friends.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.652
Don't worry.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.788
I have plenty more tricks
to show you later.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.457
Crackle? Is that you?

04:52.459 --> 04:55.994
Wow! I haven't seen you
in forever.

04:55.996 --> 04:59.431
Hi, Sizzle. I was just telling
my friend here about you.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.601
Oh! Did you mention
how I was always
the star of the show,

05:02.603 --> 05:04.803
had the widest wingspan,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.005
and knew all
the best fire tricks?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.641
Yep, I think
I covered everything.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.843
I also blew
the tallest plumes of fire.

05:11.845 --> 05:12.978
Still do!

05:12.980 --> 05:15.447
( high-pitched vocal note )

05:15.449 --> 05:17.249
Wow. Congratulations?

05:17.251 --> 05:19.451
Yeah, that's
great, Sizzle.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.852
You're still
the best.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.321
Oh, only at some things.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.489
Okay, a lot of things!

05:24.491 --> 05:25.991
-Ha-ha!
-( fire roaring )

05:27.494 --> 05:29.194
Oh! It's The Duchess!

05:29.196 --> 05:30.629
Who's The Duchess?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.264
The leader
of all the dragons,

05:32.266 --> 05:34.833
and the most
important dragon ever!

05:34.835 --> 05:40.939
Fellow dragons, welcome
to this year's Roast 'n' Toast!

05:40.941 --> 05:45.110
Up first, showing off
your fire-breathing skills.

05:45.112 --> 05:49.548
Come on, gang,
hit me with your best spark.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.985
Hark! Do mine eyes deceive me?

05:53.987 --> 05:56.822
'Tis a gathering of dragons,

05:56.824 --> 05:59.725
the same scary beasts
who had me banished.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.560
( grumbles )

06:01.562 --> 06:04.496
Ah, Basil,
my trusty steed,

06:04.498 --> 06:06.865
methinks,
nay, meknows!

06:06.867 --> 06:08.967
This is our chance
to get back at them!

06:08.969 --> 06:10.969
I, the brave Sir Oliver,

06:10.971 --> 06:14.473
shall single-handedly
ruin their picnic!

06:14.475 --> 06:16.074
( maniacal laughter )

06:16.076 --> 06:18.877
Okay, this is my chance
to impress everyone

06:18.879 --> 06:21.079
with some
really great fire shapes

06:21.081 --> 06:22.914
so they'll want
to be friends with me.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.350
Here I go! Achoo!

06:25.352 --> 06:29.521
Oh, I've never seen
a fire square before! Nice!

06:29.523 --> 06:31.723
Thanks a bunch!
I've been practicing.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.127
Is that right?
Well, so have I!

06:37.664 --> 06:40.899
Sizzle, that's the best
fire shape I've ever seen!

06:44.938 --> 06:46.671
( cheering )

06:46.673 --> 06:49.074
I'm never gonna make
any friends at this rate.

06:49.076 --> 06:52.511
Don't give up.
Why don't you try talking
to that nice dragon again?

06:52.513 --> 06:55.113
Okay. Hi!
My name is--

06:55.115 --> 06:58.083
Hey, guys! Don't you
just love The Duchess?

06:58.085 --> 07:01.453
For sure! She's only
the most important
dragon ever.

07:01.455 --> 07:04.556
Exactly, which is why
I'm so excited she asked me

07:04.558 --> 07:06.758
to be her buddy
for the Roast 'n' Toast!

07:06.760 --> 07:09.127
You're best buddies
with The Duchess?

07:09.129 --> 07:10.395
<i>The,</i> The Duchess?

07:10.397 --> 07:12.764
Wow! Good for you,
Sizzle.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.033
Wait, it gets
even better.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.968
The Duchess has taken me
under her wing

07:16.970 --> 07:20.539
and is teaching me to be
the next leader of the dragons!

07:20.541 --> 07:23.975
-That sounds...
-Incredible? It is!

07:23.977 --> 07:27.979
She's teaching me
all sorts of fabulous
head-dragon-type stuff.

07:27.981 --> 07:31.149
-Like what?
-How to create a wall of fire,

07:31.151 --> 07:34.252
and how to flap my wings
so hard they make a tornado!

07:34.254 --> 07:36.755
You know, important stuff
I'll need to know

07:36.757 --> 07:38.957
if I ever have to defend
the dragon folk.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.060
-Oh, you're so...
-Lucky? I know!

07:42.062 --> 07:45.630
I mean, I'm best buddies
with the most important dragon

07:45.632 --> 07:50.001
ever in the history of ever!

07:50.003 --> 07:53.605
Oh, and it's getting her
even more dragon friends.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.807
That's nothing, Sizzle.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.344
My dragon buddy
is even more important
than The Duchess.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.613
Pshaw. I doubt that.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.315
Well, she is.

08:03.317 --> 08:07.986
Because my buddy
is the Royal Dragon
of Enchancia!

08:07.988 --> 08:10.755
-What?
-She's a royal dragon?

08:10.757 --> 08:12.524
Of Enchancia?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.826
Oh, that's fancy.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.995
Yup! She even
has a castle.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.664
No, wait.
She has ten castles!

08:19.666 --> 08:22.300
And one of them
is made of gold.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.635
-And diamonds!
-( all gasping )

08:23.637 --> 08:26.204
So, uh, you think
you could introduce me?

08:26.206 --> 08:30.041
Yeah, I want to see
a gold castle with diamonds.

08:30.043 --> 08:34.446
Um, I've never even heard
of the Royal Dragon
of Enchancia.

08:34.448 --> 08:37.849
Then I guess you don't know
everything, Sizzle.

08:37.851 --> 08:42.153
Oh, now, excuse me.
My best buddy's looking for me,

08:42.155 --> 08:44.856
and I don't want to keep
royalty waiting.

08:44.858 --> 08:48.660
It looks like you're making
lots of dragon friends
over there, Crackle.

08:48.662 --> 08:52.464
I am, Sofia!
This picnic is going
even better than I planned.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.032
I'm so glad!

08:54.034 --> 08:56.701
Hey, watch this!

08:56.703 --> 08:58.303
I made a triangle!

08:58.305 --> 09:01.406
I was trying to make a heart,
but still, I made something!

09:01.408 --> 09:05.343
Just look at yon dragons,
Basil, cavorting about,

09:05.345 --> 09:07.579
making dragony merriment.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.714
All that is about to end.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.817
These balloons of water
will burst above them

09:12.819 --> 09:15.887
and douse
their fiery festivities!

09:15.889 --> 09:20.091
( maniacal laughter )

09:20.093 --> 09:23.762
( clicking )

09:23.764 --> 09:26.097
This isn't working.
Blasted thing.

09:26.099 --> 09:29.267
The trigger on the bowstring
must be jammed.

09:29.269 --> 09:33.338
( whimpering )

09:33.340 --> 09:36.074
They may have won
the battle, Basil,

09:36.076 --> 09:37.375
but not the war!

09:37.377 --> 09:40.779
A knight such as I
never admits defeat!

09:40.781 --> 09:42.514
( The Duchess laughing )

09:42.516 --> 09:44.516
Looking good, dragon folk!

09:44.518 --> 09:46.952
Now that we're all
nice and warmed up,

09:46.954 --> 09:49.120
it's time to do
some singing.

09:49.122 --> 09:52.824
Come rest your tails
around the bonfire.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.629
Hey, c-c-can we sit
by you guys?

09:57.631 --> 10:00.298
Sure! We always have room
for new friends.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.101
There's Smokewings
and Fire! Hi there!

10:03.103 --> 10:07.138
Oh! Uh, dragons I've
never met before.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.074
Who's that dragon
waving hi to us?

10:09.076 --> 10:12.744
I heard Crackle say
she's the Royal Dragon
of Enchancia!

10:12.746 --> 10:14.112
Ooh, how neat.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.281
Hey, I wonder if she
knows Princess Sofia.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.884
Now, who wants
to sing the first song?

10:19.886 --> 10:21.987
Oh, me! Me!
Me, me, me!

10:21.989 --> 10:24.089
But I always
go first!

10:24.091 --> 10:25.890
Then maybe
it's Crackle's turn?

10:25.892 --> 10:27.092
Yeah, maybe it is!

10:27.094 --> 10:28.760
After all, back in Enchancia

10:28.762 --> 10:31.730
I was the star
of the Leaf Song Festival.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.633
Well, I've been the star
of lots of shows, too.

10:34.635 --> 10:38.903
Have you ever performed
for the king and queen
of Enchancia? Because I have.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.305
When did you do that?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.340
And they gave me
a big trophy

10:42.342 --> 10:45.443
for being the best singer
they ever heard, ever!

10:45.445 --> 10:48.079
Crackle, can I talk
to you for a minute?

10:48.081 --> 10:50.682
You never sang
for the king and queen
of Enchancia!

10:50.684 --> 10:52.951
-I know that.
-Then why did you say you did?

10:52.953 --> 10:56.354
I am so tired of Sizzle
always being the center
of attention.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.256
I know if I could just show
the other dragons

10:58.258 --> 10:59.591
that I'm good
at things, too,

10:59.593 --> 11:01.626
then they'd want
to be friends with me!

11:01.628 --> 11:04.129
You don't have to do
something big and flashy
to make friends, Crackle.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.365
Just be yourself
and it'll happen!

11:07.367 --> 11:09.300
You know what,
I'm just gonna start singing.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.302
But not before
I start singing!

11:11.304 --> 11:14.806
¶ I'm all fired up ¶

11:14.808 --> 11:16.007
¶ Yeah ¶

11:16.009 --> 11:17.709
¶ I'm all fired up ¶

11:17.711 --> 11:19.344
( huffs )

11:19.346 --> 11:20.712
¶ You've been there
and heard that ¶

11:20.714 --> 11:22.647
¶ Now it's feeling
old hat ¶

11:22.649 --> 11:24.816
¶ Time to try
something new ¶

11:24.818 --> 11:27.185
¶ In a bright shade
of blue ¶

11:27.187 --> 11:31.022
¶ Like you know who ¶

11:31.024 --> 11:34.693
¶ I've got a treat
for you, lucky dragons ¶

11:34.695 --> 11:38.196
¶ Your favorite star, Sizzle,
is fronting the show ¶

11:38.198 --> 11:41.700
¶ Cut me some slack
if I do me some bragging ¶

11:41.702 --> 11:43.902
¶ I'm a natural-born star ¶

11:43.904 --> 11:47.572
¶ And this star's
gotta glow-oh-oh-oh ¶

11:47.574 --> 11:49.908
¶ So let's go ¶

11:49.910 --> 11:52.143
¶ Hey, I'm all fired up ¶

11:52.145 --> 11:54.145
¶ Ready for my chance ¶

11:54.147 --> 11:55.714
¶ I'm all fired up ¶

11:55.716 --> 11:57.649
¶ Watch me sing and dance ¶

11:57.651 --> 12:00.518
¶ I'm all fired up ¶

12:00.520 --> 12:02.187
¶ I'm in center stage ¶

12:02.189 --> 12:04.089
¶ Where I'm meant to be ¶

12:04.091 --> 12:07.859
¶ And everyone here
loves looking at me ¶

12:07.861 --> 12:11.396
¶ I love you right back
and with all modesty ¶

12:11.398 --> 12:15.433
¶ I'm tip of the top
and I'm singing with glee ¶

12:15.435 --> 12:17.368
¶ Check me out ¶

12:17.370 --> 12:19.070
¶ Yeah ¶

12:19.072 --> 12:21.239
¶ Check me out ¶

12:21.241 --> 12:22.674
¶ Yeah ¶

12:22.676 --> 12:24.275
¶ Hello there,
I'm still here ¶

12:24.277 --> 12:26.444
¶ Let me make
myself clear ¶

12:26.446 --> 12:28.446
¶ It's about time
that you learned ¶

12:28.448 --> 12:31.249
¶ That it's finally my turn ¶

12:31.251 --> 12:33.451
¶ So watch me burn ¶

12:33.453 --> 12:35.420
-( coughs )
-( gasps )

12:35.422 --> 12:38.790
¶ While she flames out,
I'm just getting started ¶

12:38.792 --> 12:42.260
¶ And when I make a promise
I always come through ¶

12:42.262 --> 12:45.764
¶ Sparring with me
is not for the faint-hearted ¶

12:45.766 --> 12:47.565
¶ I've spent time at the top ¶

12:47.567 --> 12:50.869
¶ And I sure like
the view-ooh-ooh-ooh ¶

12:50.871 --> 12:53.404
¶ I sure do ¶

12:53.406 --> 12:57.475
¶ But, hey, I'm still fired up
for a chance to prove ¶

12:57.477 --> 13:01.446
¶ That I'm fired up
and I've got the groove ¶

13:01.448 --> 13:04.149
¶ I'm so fired up ¶

13:04.151 --> 13:07.786
¶ I'm in center stage
where I'm meant to be ¶

13:07.788 --> 13:11.456
¶ And everyone here
loves looking at me ¶

13:11.458 --> 13:15.293
¶ I love you right back
and with all modesty ¶

13:15.295 --> 13:19.164
¶ I'm tip of the top
and I'm singing with glee ¶

13:19.166 --> 13:22.500
-¶ Hey, I'm all fired up ¶
-¶ Check me out ¶

13:22.502 --> 13:26.137
-¶ Yeah, I'm all fired up ¶
-¶ Check me out ¶

13:26.139 --> 13:32.310
-¶ Wow, I'm all fired up ¶
-¶ Check me out ¶

13:32.312 --> 13:36.648
( Sizzle sustains note )

13:37.684 --> 13:39.517
Oh, Sizzle!

13:39.519 --> 13:41.586
Why don't you sing us
another tune?

13:41.588 --> 13:44.856
I'd be happy to, buddy.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.758
Oh, I'm sorry,
Crackle.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.459
Oh, it's okay, Sofia.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.829
I should just get used
to not having any friends

13:50.831 --> 13:52.130
when Sizzle is around.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.933
( sprinkling )

13:54.935 --> 13:56.434
Fear not, Basil.

13:56.436 --> 14:00.972
I know just the thing
to ruin a dragon picnic-- ants.

14:00.974 --> 14:04.309
Same destroyers of picnics
across the land!

14:04.311 --> 14:05.810
( ants cheering, sniffing )

14:05.812 --> 14:07.478
Go forth, tiny ones!

14:07.480 --> 14:09.547
Follow my path
of breadcrumbs

14:09.549 --> 14:12.784
and do your worst
to mine enemies!

14:14.054 --> 14:16.354
( shrieking )

14:16.356 --> 14:19.557
But they seem
to prefer sugar cubes
to breadcrumbs!

14:19.559 --> 14:22.527
Leave my armor at once,
foul insects!

14:22.529 --> 14:24.529
Please! ( shrieking )

14:24.531 --> 14:28.566
All right, it's time
for the big aerial show!

14:28.568 --> 14:32.170
I want to see
your best flips and spins.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.707
Show your fellow dragons
what you got!

14:37.410 --> 14:39.544
This is my last chance
to show everyone

14:39.546 --> 14:42.013
that I'm even better
at flying than Sizzle,

14:42.015 --> 14:45.016
which means I'd make
an even better friend
than her!

14:45.018 --> 14:47.051
I was thinking you might
have more luck

14:47.053 --> 14:49.053
making friends
if you weren't so worried

14:49.055 --> 14:50.388
about impressing everyone.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.257
Mm, yeah, I like
my plan better.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.825
Let's do
some loop-de-loops!

14:53.827 --> 14:54.893
Ooh-kay.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.499
See, Sofia?
Someone's watching!

15:01.501 --> 15:03.001
Do more!

15:03.003 --> 15:05.603
Wow, look
at those moves!

15:05.605 --> 15:08.573
She should be good.
She probably has servants
to teach her,

15:08.575 --> 15:11.242
being the Royal Dragon
of Enchancia and all.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.044
-The who?
-Meanwhile, I learned

15:13.046 --> 15:16.547
my superstar flying moves
without any royal help,

15:16.549 --> 15:18.116
thank you very much.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.853
Well, I think it's
very impressive, Your Highness.

15:21.855 --> 15:24.522
Uh, thank you.

15:24.524 --> 15:28.559
Crackle, those dragons
think I'm the Royal Dragon
of Enchancia.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.528
( gasps ) That is weird.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.397
We should ignore them
and keep flying.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.198
Did you have something
to do with this?

15:34.200 --> 15:36.200
Is that why the dragons
have been fanning me

15:36.202 --> 15:37.769
and bowing
to me all day?

15:37.771 --> 15:40.638
Please, Sofia!
The Roast 'n' Toast
is almost over,

15:40.640 --> 15:43.474
and I still haven't impressed
anyone enough to be my friend!

15:43.476 --> 15:47.278
Can't you just pretend
to be the Royal Dragon,
just for a little while?

15:47.280 --> 15:51.049
I'm sorry, Crackle.
I only turned into a dragon
so you could come here.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.651
I don't feel right
lying about who I am
on top of that.

15:53.653 --> 15:57.288
Fine, I'll just find
another way to impress everyone.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.656
Watch this, everyone!

15:58.658 --> 16:02.593
I'm going to do
the quadruple loop-de-spin!

16:02.595 --> 16:05.630
-( gasping )
-But no one's ever
done that before!

16:05.632 --> 16:08.933
I have! Loads of times!
Just watch!

16:08.935 --> 16:11.536
Careful, Crackle!
Remember what
happened last time!

16:15.608 --> 16:17.575
Whoa!

16:17.577 --> 16:21.913
This isn't the kind
of attention I was hoping for.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.114
Just lift your wings.

16:23.116 --> 16:26.651
Huh! Look out!

16:28.955 --> 16:30.521
( Sofia screaming )

16:30.523 --> 16:32.590
Thank you, Ms. Duchess.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.094
Princess Sofia,
what are you doing here?

16:36.096 --> 16:39.263
-Uh, I--
-And why did Crackle say

16:39.265 --> 16:41.532
that you were
the Royal Dragon of Enchancia?

16:41.534 --> 16:43.601
You don't look
like a dragon...

16:43.603 --> 16:45.303
at least, not anymore.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.971
Ooh! My brain hurts.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.706
She isn't a dragon!

16:48.708 --> 16:51.509
Crackle was lying
all this time.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.478
( murmuring )

16:53.480 --> 16:56.347
Okay, okay.
You caught me.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.283
I was lying about having
an important dragon friend,

16:59.285 --> 17:01.486
because the truth is...

17:01.488 --> 17:05.490
I don't have any
dragon friends at all.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.557
Crackle, wait!

17:14.334 --> 17:17.235
( sighs ) I knew I shouldn't
have come to this picnic.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.173
( maniacal laughter )

17:22.175 --> 17:23.474
( gasps )

17:23.476 --> 17:24.542
Fear not, Basil.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.678
We shall best these
dastardly dragons yet

17:27.680 --> 17:30.848
by using my No-Blaze
Dragon-Proof Net.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.551
Oh, no! I have
to warn the others!

17:33.553 --> 17:36.821
Ooh! Was that last move
pretty amazing?

17:36.823 --> 17:39.023
Or is it just me?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.592
Everyone, everyone!
Please listen to me!

17:41.594 --> 17:43.761
There's a big, bad knight
in the woods,

17:43.763 --> 17:45.363
and he's coming
to get us!

17:45.365 --> 17:48.533
( laughing )
Don't listen to her.

17:48.535 --> 17:52.203
-This is just another one
of Crackle's lies.
-It is not!

17:52.205 --> 17:54.705
Yeah, I'm sorry, Crackle,
but what you're saying,

17:54.707 --> 17:56.741
it just doesn't
make any sense!

17:56.743 --> 17:59.744
Yeah, dragons are friends
with the knights
here in Brazendell.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.779
There's no reason
they'd attack.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.214
But I'm telling
the truth!

18:03.216 --> 18:06.784
You all have to leave,
or that knight will get you!

18:09.722 --> 18:11.722
There you are!
Are you okay?

18:11.724 --> 18:14.092
No! A knight is trying
to get the dragons,

18:14.094 --> 18:15.593
but no one will believe me!

18:15.595 --> 18:17.762
I was in the woods,
and I heard this big knight

18:17.764 --> 18:20.431
with a yellow feather
talking to his horse, Basil--

18:20.433 --> 18:23.234
Wait.
I know that knight!
It's Sir Oliver,

18:23.236 --> 18:25.470
and he does not
like dragons.

18:25.472 --> 18:28.806
-( maniacal laughter )
-( Basil neighing )

18:34.447 --> 18:36.380
( screaming )

18:37.750 --> 18:39.050
No need to panic.

18:39.052 --> 18:42.253
I'll just burn
this net off.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.722
It's not working!

18:47.460 --> 18:50.228
Ah-ha! My net
is magically fireproof,

18:50.230 --> 18:52.430
you overgrown iguanas!

18:52.432 --> 18:55.399
This is what you get
for crossing a knight such as I.

18:55.401 --> 18:56.801
( maniacal laughter )

18:56.803 --> 18:59.237
That knight!
He has The Duchess!

18:59.239 --> 19:00.838
He has everyone!

19:00.840 --> 19:02.473
Can't you talk
to him, Sofia?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.609
Tell him the dragons
weren't hurting anyone.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.111
I know Sir Oliver,
and he won't listen to reason.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.779
And the dragons
won't listen to me.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.682
I don't know anything
about stopping knights.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.819
-( gasps ) But Sizzle might.
-Huh? What do you mean?

19:14.821 --> 19:17.121
The Duchess is training you
to lead the dragons.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.290
She taught you
how to create a wall of fire!

19:19.292 --> 19:22.126
-That's great!
-Oh, right.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.861
And how to flap
your wings so hard

19:23.863 --> 19:25.763
they make wind
like a tornado!

19:25.765 --> 19:28.533
Those things will definitely
help us stop Sir Oliver.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.601
Okay, well, the thing is

19:30.603 --> 19:33.304
I don't actually know
how to do any of that.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.173
What do you mean?
The Duchess taught you--

19:35.175 --> 19:38.309
Nothing. She taught
me nothing, okay?

19:38.311 --> 19:39.710
She hasn't
been training me

19:39.712 --> 19:41.779
to lead the dragons
because...

19:41.781 --> 19:45.383
I didn't have any friends
of my own to come with.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.685
But you're always surrounded
by other dragons!

19:47.687 --> 19:50.321
Oh, sure, they like
to watch me do stuff,

19:50.323 --> 19:52.323
but when I'm not
putting on a show,

19:52.325 --> 19:54.125
they just go away.

19:54.127 --> 19:56.694
I can't believe you were
lying this whole time!

19:56.696 --> 19:58.062
Yeah, well,
so were you!

19:58.064 --> 20:00.164
Guys, that doesn't
matter right now.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.699
You both made
a mistake,

20:01.701 --> 20:03.568
but now it's time
to work together

20:03.570 --> 20:04.869
to help our friends.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.306
( maniacal laughter )

20:08.308 --> 20:10.308
I'm up for that
if Sizzle is.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.577
I was about to say
the same thing!

20:12.579 --> 20:14.712
Good, because I
have an idea.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.683
Yoo-hoo!
Sir Oliver!

20:18.685 --> 20:20.251
Princess Sofia?

20:20.253 --> 20:22.153
Well, I hope you're not here

20:22.155 --> 20:24.355
to defend
these wretched dragons!

20:24.357 --> 20:26.924
Oh, no, I'm here
to get your autograph.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.359
When we first met,

20:28.361 --> 20:30.928
I didn't realize
how famous you were!

20:30.930 --> 20:32.163
How baffling.

20:32.165 --> 20:35.433
I'm sure I mentioned it
quite a few times!

20:35.435 --> 20:38.436
But I am happy
to oblige.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.371
( giggling )
Give me that.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.873
Sir...

20:42.875 --> 20:44.875
Oliver.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.244
( sustained high-pitched note )

20:46.246 --> 20:47.912
My ears!

20:47.914 --> 20:49.046
SOFIA: Now, Crackle!

20:49.048 --> 20:50.748
One poorly executed

20:50.750 --> 20:52.950
quadruple loop-de-spin
coming up!

20:55.688 --> 20:56.887
We're free!

20:56.889 --> 20:57.855
Nice going!

20:57.857 --> 20:59.890
Please, that horrible high note

20:59.892 --> 21:03.794
is intolerable!
( whimpers )

21:03.796 --> 21:06.631
( Sizzle stops singing )
You did it, Crackle!

21:06.633 --> 21:08.866
Now, drop that net
on Sir Oliver!

21:09.802 --> 21:11.435
Wait! I take
it all back!

21:11.437 --> 21:14.739
I love dragons!

21:14.741 --> 21:18.376
Agh! Uh! Let me out,
you scaly snakes!

21:18.378 --> 21:20.745
Actually, Sir Oliver,
I think it's time

21:20.747 --> 21:22.113
you take a little trip.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.180
Ladies?

21:24.817 --> 21:26.384
( screams )

21:26.386 --> 21:29.120
-( singing )
-Oh, my ears!

21:29.122 --> 21:30.921
Thou hast wonnest this round!

21:30.923 --> 21:34.959
But I shall winnest
the next!

21:34.961 --> 21:36.994
-Yes!
-Whoo-how!

21:36.996 --> 21:38.896
You were amazing, Crackle.

21:38.898 --> 21:42.300
I think you actually
did the quadruple loop-de-spin!

21:42.302 --> 21:44.835
Maybe. I lost count
of the loops,

21:44.837 --> 21:47.004
but, Sizzle,
your singing, wow!

21:47.006 --> 21:49.407
Let's hear it
for Sizzle and Crackle!

21:49.409 --> 21:50.574
( cheering )

21:50.576 --> 21:52.343
That really
saved the day!

21:52.345 --> 21:53.577
( cheering )

21:53.579 --> 21:55.346
Ha-ha! This is one picnic

21:55.348 --> 21:57.315
we will never forget.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.350
I'd like to thank
all three of you

21:59.352 --> 22:01.786
for saving
our scaly hides.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.154
To be honest, Auntie,

22:03.156 --> 22:05.856
it was mostly Crackle
and Sofia.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.992
Well, I'm proud
of all of you.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.028
Fellow dragons,
it's time to end

22:11.030 --> 22:12.697
this year's
Roast 'n' Toast

22:12.699 --> 22:15.633
with some marshmallows
around the fire.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.034
Who's in?

22:17.036 --> 22:18.636
-I am!
-( murmurs of agreement )

22:18.638 --> 22:20.871
Do you two want
to roast some marshmallows?

22:20.873 --> 22:25.710
I do, but only
if my friend Crackle
comes with me.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.878
Friend? You mean it, Sizzle?

22:27.880 --> 22:31.716
I sure do. In fact,
next Roast 'n' Toast,

22:31.718 --> 22:34.819
do you maybe wanna
come with me?

22:34.821 --> 22:37.955
( gasps )
You bet I would!

22:37.957 --> 22:40.691
I always said you were
a terrific dragon, Crackle,

22:40.693 --> 22:42.493
and an even better friend.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.562
You too, Sofia.
I mean it.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.164
You were getting really good
at the dragon stuff.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.567
Thanks! And I'm
not done yet.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.869
I want to be
a dragon.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.844
Aah! I did it.
I breathed fire.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.946
You are
a royal dragon, Sofia!
