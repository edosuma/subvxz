[BO narrating]
Previously, on Lost Girl:

00:07.425 --> 00:08.505
Because we are family.

00:08.718 --> 00:11.050
But family... sticks together.

00:11.262 --> 00:12.047
The Helskér.

00:12.263 --> 00:15.005
The ancient Helshoes, sought
after by the most powerful Fae.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.805
That they can lead
to the end of days.

00:17.018 --> 00:18.554
Dyson, where is
that second Helshoe?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.305
Hidden. Wait for the true hero.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.226
Will you marry me?

00:21.439 --> 00:23.145
[KENZI] We just need
to slow down a bit.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.474
We have all the
time in the world.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.480
Bo, you can bring him back.
You have to do it!

00:28.696 --> 00:30.152
No, Kenzi,
there isn't enough chi!

00:30.364 --> 00:31.069
Take it from me!

00:31.282 --> 00:32.237
No! I can't lose you.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.406
I will never forgive you.

00:34.619 --> 00:36.826
I chose you.
And you broke my heart.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.074
Un... claim... me.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.370
| unclaim you.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.995
[BO] My father's close.
I can feel him!

00:43.211 --> 00:45.873
I swear fealty to you,
Ysabeau. Forever.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.999
[B0] A human doctor
who can turn the Fae mortal?

00:48.216 --> 00:49.171
They're gonna be coming for you.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.168
Yeah? Let 'em try.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.375
And the daughter's
heart will close the portal?

00:52.595 --> 00:54.551
[KENZI] It is the only way
to close the gateway to Hell.

00:54.764 --> 00:56.595
It's Bo's heart. And I'm it.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.672
[KENZI] I will
wait for Bo in Valhalla.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.758
[BO] Whatever it takes,
I will get you back.

01:00.978 --> 01:04.937
You can't let Bo
find the second Helshoe!

02:11.007 --> 02:13.714

expecting a booby trap.

02:17.513 --> 02:21.131
[BO breathing heavily]

02:40.202 --> 02:42.409
Oh, come on.

[BO] Ah!

02:44.373 --> 02:48.833
[distant bird caws]

03:06.729 --> 03:08.811
Is she dead?

03:09.023 --> 03:11.014
Looks like she's still breathin'.

03:11.233 --> 03:14.191
Let's take her home
an' take care of her.

03:14.403 --> 03:17.361
Let's take turns
takin' care of her.

03:18.282 --> 03:25.700
My, my. Aren't you
a pretty little thing?

03:43.849 --> 03:45.009
[MAN groans]

03:45.226 --> 03:47.308
How sad for you.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.854
You won't get to take
care of anyone. Ever again.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.896

04:33.607 --> 04:35.143
[BO]
Where'd you hide it this time?

04:35.359 --> 04:36.314
Where did I hide what shoe?

04:36.527 --> 04:39.485
Oh, lying is not your strong
suit, milkmouth. Cough it up.

04:39.697 --> 04:42.154
You found the other one? How?

04:42.366 --> 04:46.325
Eagles. Climbing. Very "I'm Not
a Girl, Not Yet a Woman."

04:46.537 --> 04:48.198
So I can finally put on
both shoes and skip into

04:48.414 --> 04:49.904
[BO]
Valhalla to get Kenzi back.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.113
You remember? Kenzi?

04:51.333 --> 04:53.494
She raised you when you
were a wee reborn Valkyrie.

04:53.711 --> 04:55.451
Bo. You can't go.

04:55.671 --> 04:56.251
Why?

04:56.464 --> 04:58.500
You just can't.
You'll never come back.

04:58.716 --> 04:59.671
Why?

04:59.884 --> 05:04.173
I can't say. But there is
a why. A really good why.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.003
Good stuff. Very convincing.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.807
[TAMSIN] Bo, please.
You have to trust me. Please.

05:10.019 --> 05:13.102
I can hear you in your sleep.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.770
Screaming.

05:17.026 --> 05:20.143
What happened when
you delivered Kenzi's soul?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.687
| wish I could tell you.

05:23.908 --> 05:28.277
Whatever it is--Hell fires,
evil dragons, sexy dragons--

05:28.496 --> 05:29.406
I don't care.

05:29.622 --> 05:31.328
I can handle it.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.036
[BO] We can handle it.

05:34.251 --> 05:37.243
Come with me. You're the
only one who can help.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.216
[sighs]

05:41.425 --> 05:45.509
Solo mission. Got it.
Just hand over the footwear.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.387
It belonged to the Una Mens.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.056
Yeah. They're dead. Your point?

05:52.937 --> 05:55.178
It's with the next in charge.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.647
You found it?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.194
Bo. We need to talk.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.395
Is this the part
where you tell me that

06:05.616 --> 06:06.731
I'm making
the wrong choice?

06:06.951 --> 06:08.282
That I'm putting
myself in grave danger.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.904
Well, sort of. And--

06:10.120 --> 06:12.736
And in dealing matters of the
afterlife, there are unknowns.

06:12.957 --> 06:14.788
Rules. Everything has a price.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.456
And whatever that costs,
you're willing to pay it?

06:16.669 --> 06:18.284
Nailed it.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.995
Look, Kenzi might be in danger.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.046
[BO] Scared.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.466
And worst of all, she is alone.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.214
Look, l was held back
from saving her once.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.636
I will not let
that happen again.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.224
Well, we'll do whatever
we can on this side

06:31.433 --> 06:33.094
to ensure your safe return.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.593
You know I'd go with
you if I could, right?

06:36.814 --> 06:39.055
Because you
pledged fealty to me?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.478
Because I love Kenzi too.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.113
For the worthy hero.

06:49.702 --> 06:51.408
[TRICK] Bring her home.

06:51.620 --> 06:57.286
And if you happen to see
Isabeau, your grandmother...

06:57.501 --> 06:59.332
tell her...

07:05.968 --> 07:07.833
Let's hope they fit.

[LAUREN] Okay. Keep her in ICU
and administer an epidural.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.475
[MALE DOCTOR] Mhmmm.

[LAUREN] What about bed one?

07:29.033 --> 07:31.900
He's code you-know-what.
We'll take him in.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.996
[BO] Worst case? I lose all
control and go on a murder spree

07:45.215 --> 07:46.716
like the last person
who put on these shoes.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.382
And the only way to stop
my is to--[clicking sound]

07:49.595 --> 07:50.880
That's code for slit my throat.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.838
Mmm. Very clear. Thank you.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.548
I'm assuming that's what
happened to the woman from

07:55.768 --> 07:58.100
Dyson's past your
subconscious depicted as me?

07:58.312 --> 07:59.643

07:59.855 --> 08:01.391

08:01.607 --> 08:02.437
Was I any good?

08:02.650 --> 08:03.605

08:03.817 --> 08:04.897
A plus.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.726
[beeping]

08:07.946 --> 08:09.732
Lauren, I don't
want to hurt anyone.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.530
You won't. I won't let you.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.233
[LAUREN] That's why you're here.

08:14.453 --> 08:18.492
I will monitor and sedate you at
the first sign of abnormality.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.786
[LAUREN] I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you, Bo.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.538
You know that.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.411
[LAUREN] Listen--

[gaSPSI

08:27.257 --> 08:28.872

08:29.093 --> 08:30.333
Oh. Oh, we're joking.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.382
[BOTH laugh]

08:31.595 --> 08:32.835
Sorry.

08:33.055 --> 08:34.511
Please just refrain from
putting on the other one.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.179
I need at least twenty
or thirty minutes

08:36.392 --> 08:38.678
to hook up your vital
organs to the ECG.

08:38.894 --> 08:39.724
[LAUREN] Then I'm
gonna need an accurate

08:39.937 --> 08:41.677
body temperature reading.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.639
Orally will work, but rectally
is generally considered--

08:44.858 --> 08:46.564
--[LAUREN] You know what, orally is fine.
--I just have to get to Kenzi.

[LAUREN]
Yeah, I'm going as fast as I can, Bo.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.741
Uh...

09:02.960 --> 09:03.710
What did you do?

09:03.919 --> 09:05.625
[BC]
I had to. I couldn't wait.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.419
Oh god. Something's
happening inside me.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.871
[LAUREN] Okay, just--
just breathe. Relax.

09:09.091 --> 09:09.625
Try to control it.

09:09.842 --> 09:10.922
I'm trying. I can't!

09:11.135 --> 09:12.716
[LAUREN] Bo Dennis.
You listen to me.

09:12.928 --> 09:15.044
If anybody can, you can.

09:15.264 --> 09:16.845
Take my hand.

You disappear.

10:06.482 --> 10:07.562
The shit-storm.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.606
Welcome to my Hell.

10:16.116 --> 10:16.150

thirty-nine events,

10:16.158 --> 10:19.571
Two hundred and six arrivals,
thirty-nine events,

10:19.787 --> 10:22.244
and a disaster of a
reno in the turkish spa.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.321
A spa? In Hell?

10:24.541 --> 10:26.998
Only I'm allowed to call
it Hell. It's Valhalla to you.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.701
I need arrangements
in all the lobbies.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.206
And I like my boquets tight.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.287
I don't like filler.
I hate filler.

10:32.508 --> 10:35.375
No, who likes filler?
It's so blah.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.843
You're not the florist.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.474
Then why in the name
of my glorious afterlife

10:43.685 --> 10:46.267
were you fondling my flower?

10:46.939 --> 10:50.272
That's a great setup for
a joke, really. But lady-—

10:50.484 --> 10:51.974
Mistress.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.309
What am I supposed to do now?

10:53.529 --> 10:56.566
My florist is stuck
in Tartarus until Tuesday.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.279
I'm looking for a friend.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.702
How refreshingly earnest of you.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.530
Check in first.
Make friends later.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.990
[MALE CLERK]
I'm sorry. I've checked.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.166
You're not in our system.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.581

11:15.801 --> 11:18.417
Ugh... A stray.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.800

11:26.728 --> 11:28.855
Always book ahead.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.147
What's your name?

11:34.736 --> 11:36.522
[BO] Looks like
they could use your help.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.229
[WOMAN] Mmm. Warriors, truly.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.781
They would kill to win.

11:41.994 --> 11:45.327
Until a bus killed them.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.996
Large groups are the worst.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.203
Speak for yourself.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.420
[GIRL 1]
William Shakespeare. I saw him.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.417
[GIRL 2] You did?

11:56.633 --> 11:57.497
[GIRL 1] I did.

11:57.718 --> 11:58.673
Your name, please.

11:58.886 --> 12:02.003
You cut right to
the chase. [chuckles]

12:02.222 --> 12:03.723
I need you to
help me find someone.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.389
No touching. Just your name.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.973
Iam, uh...

12:11.189 --> 12:13.350
so freakin' excited
to be here that

12:13.567 --> 12:17.981
[BO] I have to use the
little Fae's room. Again.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.318
I'll be right back.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.884
[TV chatter]

12:47.100 --> 12:48.010
[TAMSIN grunts]

12:48.226 --> 12:50.558
[TV chatter]

12:50.771 --> 12:53.604
Wow. This is sad.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.227
You have to tell me
everything that you know

12:56.443 --> 12:57.944
about the underrealms.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.484
Eat a sack of tits.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.903
Sorry. What did you say to me?

13:02.115 --> 13:05.198
Eat. A sack. Of tits.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.951
All right. Okay. Why?

13:08.163 --> 13:09.448
Because then your
mouth would be full of tits

13:09.665 --> 13:11.781
and I wouldn't have to
listen to your dumbass voice.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.410
Okay.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.671
Valhalla is your home.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.043
[TAMSIN] More like head office.

13:21.259 --> 13:25.002
The point is is that you
can help and you have to try.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.589
You think it's
so easy don't you?

13:28.809 --> 13:29.844
No I don't, actually.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.221
I don't think anything
that we do is easy.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.769
But that doesn't mean
that we shouldn't try.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.223
You claim to be
a part of this group.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.398
That you love Kenzi and Bo.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.272
I don't see it.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.947
Well maybe you should
wear some glasses.

13:45.158 --> 13:49.242
Hmmm. You kinda
peaked at "sack of tits."

13:49.454 --> 13:53.948
Now tell me.
What is Bo up against?

13:56.086 --> 13:58.122
[sighs]

14:05.637 --> 14:08.754
Or just destroy
the chesterfield.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.556
If they find out this
diary exists, I'm dead.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.931
How is documentation
of your first Valkyrie kiss

14:15.147 --> 14:16.933
supposed to help me?

14:17.149 --> 14:18.855
It's less first-finger-bang,

14:19.067 --> 14:20.773
more...

14:20.986 --> 14:23.147
Just more. Trust me.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.068
Plus I never kiss and tell.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.775
Fine. So sprout some
wings and fly to Bo.

14:29.995 --> 14:33.453
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't. I need a soul.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.328
Oh. Well | just happen to have
a half breed Kapre in my clinic

14:37.544 --> 14:39.830
coughing up fire balls
with minutes left to live.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.038
You need a soul? You got one.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.999
You'll never understand.
You're human.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.628
Yeah? Well maybe not.

14:46.845 --> 14:51.009
But we have all made
sacrifices. Except for you.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.883
It's time to get
your Valkyrie on, Tamsin.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.307
[elevator ding]

14:57.522 --> 15:14.156
[elevator music plays]

15:14.372 --> 15:15.623
[BO sighs]

15:15.832 --> 15:17.914
Please be chocolate.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.797
Kenzi prints.

15:23.006 --> 15:30.674
[music continues]

15:30.889 --> 15:32.299
[elevator dings]

16:16.393 --> 16:17.803
Kenzi?

16:18.812 --> 16:20.302
Bobo.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.400
--[KENZI] Ah! You came!
--[BO] It's really you!

16:27.612 --> 16:28.522
--[KENZI] Oh my god.
--[BO] Are you okay?

16:28.738 --> 16:36.406
[BOTH talk over
each other rapidly]

16:36.621 --> 16:37.326
You don't look dead.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.494
I don't feel dead.

16:38.707 --> 16:39.822
--[BO] I missed you.
--[KENZI] I missed you.

16:40.041 --> 16:40.996
Not just since you
walked into the portal,

16:41.209 --> 16:42.073
since before then, since--

16:42.294 --> 16:42.953
--[KENZI] Bo.
--[BO] No, no, no.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.080
I was distant and selfish.

16:44.296 --> 16:47.129
Bo! You're here. I'm here.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.049
In couture, apparently.
That's all that matters.

16:51.845 --> 16:52.595
Have you seen Hale?

16:52.804 --> 16:54.010
Safety test!

16:54.222 --> 16:55.257
Uh, mother's name?

16:55.473 --> 16:58.385
Mmm. Birth: Aife.
Adoptive: Mary Dennis.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.012
Dream: Tina Turner.

17:00.228 --> 17:00.933
[KENZI] Wing sauce?!

17:01.146 --> 17:04.855
Oh, half extra hot, half honey
garlic. All blue cheese dipped.

17:05.066 --> 17:05.896
Middle name?

17:06.109 --> 17:07.519
Trick question.
You don't have one.

17:07.736 --> 17:08.646
Favorite alias?

17:08.862 --> 17:10.318
Oh, that is too hard.
You have too many.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.770
[KENZI] Oh, come on.
You got this!

17:11.990 --> 17:12.615
--[BO] Uh...
--[KENZI] You got this.

17:12.824 --> 17:13.199
[KENZI] You got this.

17:13.408 --> 17:14.693
Oh! Toni with an "i" Soprano!

17:14.910 --> 17:15.569
[KENZI screams]

17:15.785 --> 17:18.527
Get your bodacious booty onto
my double premium top matress

17:18.747 --> 17:20.738
[KENZI] so I can tell you all
about how this place is Hell.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.948
Do you want a Belgian waffle?

17:26.713 --> 17:27.828
[giggles]

17:28.048 --> 17:28.878
[KENZI] Ta-da!

17:29.090 --> 17:31.172
Yeah. It's totally hellish.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.128
Mmm.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.006
[KENZI] Mhmmm.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.132
Has anyone hurt you?

17:36.348 --> 17:36.962
No.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.467
Tourture? Hell fires? Dragons?

17:38.683 --> 17:40.184
No, no, and | wish!

17:40.393 --> 17:43.305
Dude, it's been five star
everything since I got here.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.058
Anything I want, mine!
Watch this.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.810
Um, hi. I'm not
really feeling my view.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.895
Could we switch it up? Thanks!

17:54.115 --> 17:56.151
[metal cranking]

17:56.368 --> 17:57.323
No way!

17:57.535 --> 17:58.661
[KENZI] You know how
many emojis I've wanted to

17:58.870 --> 18:00.280
text you about this place?

18:00.497 --> 18:02.328
[KENZI]
Any Ben and Jerry's flav I want.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.782
Including the discontinued
Oatmeal Cookie Chunk!

18:06.002 --> 18:06.832
Shut. Up.

18:07.045 --> 18:07.875
[KENZI] Mhmmm.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.828
Oh my god. And look what I have.

18:10.048 --> 18:13.040
Clueless 2. Sister Act 3:
Rosary's Baby's Got Back.

18:13.260 --> 18:17.799
A prequel to Goonies.
And they're all super watchable.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.925
Did you say double pillow top?

18:20.141 --> 18:23.224
[KENZI] Yes, I did.
Oh my god, and look at this.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.894
Apparently,
I am hosting a party.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.519
They keep sending me
dresses in my exact size

18:29.734 --> 18:31.599
and hard to pin-point style.

18:32.862 --> 18:33.988
But listen,
I am so glad you're here

18:34.197 --> 18:36.062
to save me
from this trash hole.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.774
[phone rings]

18:42.789 --> 18:44.290
Hello mouth breather.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.990
If you wanna play stalker
from The Bodyguard,

18:47.210 --> 18:49.496
try Whitney's room. I'm busy.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.043
Ugh!

18:51.256 --> 18:52.166
What was that about?

18:52.382 --> 18:54.964
Ugh. Blue light hotel perv,
like, calls once a day.

18:55.176 --> 18:58.259
[KENZI] Yet another reason
for you to get me outta here.

19:00.223 --> 19:02.839
After a scoop of Chunky Monkey.

19:08.106 --> 19:08.936
[BOTH] Mmm.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.059
Oh my god, isn't that good?

19:10.275 --> 19:10.809
[BO] It's so good.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.607
I think they use
different milk in Valhalla.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.607
For all we know,
they're being tortured.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.360
Or burned alive.
Or worse, buried alive.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.282
Over and over again.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.610
They're Helshoes.
Emphasis on the "Hel."

19:23.830 --> 19:26.537
Why couldn't Tamsin
just tell us herself?

19:26.750 --> 19:29.207
A Valkyrie's blood is bound secrecy.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.627
If they discuss details of
the "other-worlds," they die.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.626
So she can't even communicate
that she can't communicate.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.208
So Tamsin's only outlet
is a secret journal.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.635
[DYSON] Listen to this.
"Thomas is a simple human.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.055
If it wasn't for his
muscular arms and enormous--"

19:47.020 --> 19:49.932
"He thinks my job is
so simple. Heaven, hell.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.263
[DYSON] It's so
much more than that.

19:51.483 --> 19:55.192
I have to run along now.
Sneaking into Tartarus with Nismat today."

19:55.403 --> 19:56.438
Tartarus?

19:56.654 --> 19:59.031
It's an afterlife
I thought was fiction.

20:00.325 --> 20:05.319
Folklore says that souls are
assigned to different realms.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.574
I don't get it.
If Kenzi's in Valhalla,

20:07.791 --> 20:09.907
[LAUREN] wouldn't the
shoes bring Bo here?

20:10.126 --> 20:15.246
Hey. "How silly. Everyone is
chattering about a pair of shoes

20:15.465 --> 20:17.547
[DYSON] created for
non-Valkyries so they can

20:17.759 --> 20:21.422
enter Valhalla
on the... 'bi frost"'?

20:21.638 --> 20:22.844
Bifr6st.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.341
You hungry, Trick?

20:24.557 --> 20:28.175
Bifrost connects the
different realms. A bridge.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.260
In some cases a teleport.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.096
That explains
Bo's super solar flare.

20:33.316 --> 20:36.900
"The wearer of the
shoes can collect souls

20:37.112 --> 20:41.947
to build a dark army.
The army to end all life."

20:46.496 --> 20:48.612
The real question.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.244
Why do they only work on Bo?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.666
[TRICK] Someone
or something wants her

20:53.878 --> 20:55.129
to bring Hell on Earth.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.704
This is bigger than
bringing Kenzi back, isn't it?

20:57.924 --> 21:00.085
It's bigger than all of us.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.633
Hey. I've been here.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.177
[DYSON] This is
where I found Tamsin.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.096
This is a gate where
souls cross over to Valhalla.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.015
But it only reveals
itself to Valkyries.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.184
Maybe we can mislead it.

21:13.022 --> 21:16.105
I found Tamsin's hair
in Massimo's druid stash.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.933
[LAUREN] He said it was
the key to opening things.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.270
[DYSON] Usually I'm
against all things Massimo,

21:21.489 --> 21:23.445
but if it's the only way...

21:24.784 --> 21:26.320
Let's go open some gates.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.961
[WOMAN] I said lamé!

21:43.344 --> 21:44.845
[TAMSIN] Hey Freyja.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.716
Tamsin, what color
would you say that chair is?

21:50.935 --> 21:53.347
Um, not Iamé?

21:53.563 --> 21:55.053
Good answer.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.183
[FREYJA] Go.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.771
You came home.

22:04.991 --> 22:09.234
[TAMSIN] Just delivering
a soul. Wanted to see you.

22:09.454 --> 22:13.163
Thank you for being so... great.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.956
You are a
suspicious little thing.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.410
A Valkyrie with
an extra seven lives.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.416
Mmm. Is that what
they're calling me now?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.372
It's not that catchy.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.833
It was quite the deal you
made with the Blood King.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.339
Something you
could never take back.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.347
I came for forgiveness.

22:32.936 --> 22:36.303
[whispering]

22:36.523 --> 22:40.812
And yet you bring
me sub-par souls.

22:42.612 --> 22:43.522
Get rid of it.

22:43.738 --> 22:44.602
Up or down?

22:44.822 --> 22:45.607
Down.

22:45.823 --> 22:47.563
What? It's a noble
half breed Kapre.

22:47.784 --> 22:50.275
With a dead tooth
and no place with us.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.407
[FREYJA]
We house fallen warriors.

22:53.623 --> 22:59.118
You're going to resume your
Valkyrie ways, do it right.

23:00.505 --> 23:02.496
[FREYJA] Like Stacey.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.422
Brave girl. You're back.

23:06.135 --> 23:09.593
[STACEY] And back
on complex carbs, I see.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.808
I brought you Rainer.
I paid my debt.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.180
It's gonna take a
lot more than that to

23:17.397 --> 23:19.308
make amends with your sisters.

23:19.524 --> 23:21.515
[FREYJA] You've made
too many deals, Tamsin.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.895
Deals with the wrong people.

23:24.112 --> 23:26.569
[TAMSIN] It's my fault.

23:26.781 --> 23:29.739
I wanted to
live longer. I get that.

23:29.951 --> 23:35.992
But after everything,
here I am. Standing with you.

23:37.458 --> 23:41.451
Mistress, Mother of Valkyries,
I know it's against our code

23:41.671 --> 23:44.162
but I must talk to
you about a liberation.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.333
I'm interested in a far
different kind of release.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.552
Tell me about these souls.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.932
Fae and a human,
but it's not their time.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.349
Using Valhalla as your
own personal holding pen

24:04.569 --> 24:06.059
is a faux-pas.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.608
[FREYJA] I've been
patient with you for years.

24:09.824 --> 24:13.066
All your lives.
Now it's your turn.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.493
I'll do anything.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.741
[distant phone rings]

24:17.957 --> 24:19.288
It's for you.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.250
No.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.245
Yes.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.576
[phone continues]

24:22.795 --> 24:25.172
Now that you're back,
you know what you have to do.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.963
Who you have to be.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.916
[FREYJA] I've held
him back long enough.

24:30.136 --> 24:36.928
[phone ringing]

24:37.143 --> 24:40.476
You made such a mess, Tamsin.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.555
Clean it up.

24:43.775 --> 24:48.769
[phone continues]

24:58.748 --> 25:00.830
Why haven't we ever
been on vacation?

25:01.042 --> 25:04.034
Apocalypses. Love triangles.
It's hard to get away.

25:04.253 --> 25:04.833
[knocking at the door]

25:05.046 --> 25:06.456
Ooh.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.626
Sometimes I wish our
lives were less fraught

25:09.842 --> 25:11.423
and more froth, ya know.

25:23.356 --> 25:24.391
Kenzi?

25:24.607 --> 25:26.143
[BO] What's wrong? What is it?

25:27.985 --> 25:30.397
Um.

25:30.613 --> 25:35.607
I ripped this exact photo
in half. The only copy.

25:36.452 --> 25:37.612
[BO] You guys look so happy.

25:37.829 --> 25:39.319
No. Bo. That--That's
Hale's chicken scratch

25:39.539 --> 25:41.370
on the back. I know it.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.493
Well what does it say?

25:43.710 --> 25:46.543
"See you soon little mama."

25:46.754 --> 25:49.666
Do you think
it's actually from him?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.543
No.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.260
We need to go.

25:54.303 --> 25:57.045
Uh, Kenz.

25:57.265 --> 26:00.849
[30}
That party that you're hosting?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.925
It's a wedding.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.431
What?

26:04.647 --> 26:06.308
Whose?

26:06.524 --> 26:09.015
Yours. To Hale.

26:12.739 --> 26:17.699
Uh... No. No. That is not
happening. I mean--

26:17.910 --> 26:19.446
--[BO] Kenz.
--[KENZI] Don't K-Kenz me.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.823
You--You came
here to bring me home.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.904
Bo before bro.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.035
Let's go.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.412
What if this is real?

26:27.628 --> 26:28.663
[BO] I know that
you've been telling yourself

26:28.880 --> 26:30.120
that this place is horrible.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.079
Uh, yeah. Because it totally is.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.130
[BO] But what if it's not?

26:33.342 --> 26:34.957
Please, ju--stop. Okay?

26:35.178 --> 26:36.167
If it makes you happy--

26:36.387 --> 26:37.251
[KENZI]
Why does that even matter?

26:37.472 --> 26:40.305
Because you deserve to be happy.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.845
[BO] You deserve. And if
that is what your heart wants,

26:44.061 --> 26:46.723
if you are happy here...

26:47.690 --> 26:52.059
I would do anything to
see him again. Anything.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.563
[KENZI] To see him smile at me.

26:59.911 --> 27:03.074
[sighs] He has such a nice back.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.324
The selfish thing
for me to do would be

27:04.540 --> 27:07.327
to drag you home with me.

27:07.543 --> 27:10.125
You need to find out.

27:12.882 --> 27:16.340
Um, will you stay?

27:16.552 --> 27:20.044
Come to my I-can't-believe-
I'm-saying-this wedding?

27:21.182 --> 27:23.594
Well, you're gonna
need a Maid of Honor.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.596
[BOTH chuckle]

27:27.563 --> 27:29.178
Do you think...?

27:33.277 --> 27:35.734
Maybe this is Heaven.

27:38.241 --> 27:40.072
[BOTH chuckle]

27:41.410 --> 27:44.777
[laughs]

27:44.997 --> 27:46.407
[KENZIﬂghﬂ

27:46.624 --> 27:51.960
[phone rings]

27:56.050 --> 27:59.884
Eyes both brown and blue.
Virtuous, yet lustful.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.462
Heart both strong and gentle.

28:02.682 --> 28:06.049
Neither Dark
nor Light... yet both.

28:07.645 --> 28:08.885
She is yours.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.614
T-Boz! You came!

28:26.831 --> 28:29.538
Oh my god, dude. I totally
just got lady groomed for my...

28:29.750 --> 28:31.286
Oh my god. Are you
my something old?

28:31.502 --> 28:32.787
I mean, not that
you look it, you just are.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.619
Fact. All the lives.

28:34.839 --> 28:36.204
Oh no, you're mad.

28:36.424 --> 28:37.334
Where's Bo?

28:37.550 --> 28:39.506
Uh, she's on a scavenger hunt
looking for something new,

28:39.719 --> 28:41.960
something old, something borrowed--

28:42.179 --> 28:44.761
Hello! Is Valkyrie
chick-lit not a thing?

28:44.974 --> 28:47.056
Dude, that means
I'm getting married.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.384
Apparently. To Hale.

28:49.604 --> 28:50.593
Do you really think he's here?

28:50.813 --> 28:53.099
Did one of your sisters bring him?

28:53.316 --> 28:58.106
I said where is Bo?

28:58.321 --> 29:01.609
Why so sérieuse?
I heard you the first time.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.610
And what did I teach you
about personal space, huh?

29:03.826 --> 29:05.612
Seven inch minimum.
Not so breathy.

29:05.828 --> 29:07.329
[TAMSIN]
I need to right my wrong.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.244
[KENZI] Um, okay. Can I
get you like, a chamomile?

29:09.457 --> 29:10.572
Or like, a Rooibos?

29:10.791 --> 29:12.747
Something soothing?
They've got all kinds here.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.451
[TAMSIN] Last time.
Where is Bo?!

29:15.671 --> 29:17.172
Last time? Thank Geri Halliwell,

29:17.381 --> 29:18.882
'cause I was getting
tired of that question.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.251
[TAMSIN] Do you think I'm
gonna let a little human

29:20.468 --> 29:21.583
get in the way
of my true potential?

29:21.802 --> 29:23.178
Your true potential used
to be eating a whole box

29:23.387 --> 29:24.547
of Vector in one sitting.

29:24.764 --> 29:28.052
Dude, come on! Cheesies,
bad hair days, X-Files.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.803
I practically raised you, remember?

29:30.019 --> 29:32.726
I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just
gonna squeeze you 'til you pop.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.725
Wow. And ew.

29:36.901 --> 29:39.859
Oh my god! I'm so sorry.
I was aiming for your boob.

29:40.071 --> 29:43.108
Please tell me that's
your resting Valhalla face.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.867
Angry face.
Definitely angry face.

30:05.346 --> 30:09.214
[STACEY] The not-florist.
Can I help you?

30:09.433 --> 30:12.641
I was just looking
for something blue.

30:12.853 --> 30:15.981
It's my, uh,
best friend's wedding.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.806
It's my favorite wedding movie.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.401
No shit. You're a succubus.

30:22.613 --> 30:24.274
Have you seen the groom?

30:24.490 --> 30:27.607
[STACEY] Hale?
I heard he's on his way.

30:27.827 --> 30:30.864
Traffic on the
Bifrost can be brutal.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.617
Let's hope he's not late.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.084
Or intercepted.

30:38.295 --> 30:42.038
What did you say? I like
my caveats loud and clear.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.544
Kenzi proved herself
a worthy warrior.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.627
Frayja's celebrating
her and her love.

30:47.847 --> 30:48.836
[STACEY] It was all perfect.

30:49.056 --> 30:49.715
Was?

30:49.932 --> 30:52.548
Now that you're here sniffing
around, I'm not so sure anymore.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.053
I have to tell Frayja.

30:54.270 --> 30:56.135
No, no, no.
I won't get in the way.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.640
You don't have
to worry about me.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.393
I need to see Hale.

30:59.608 --> 31:03.146
You can't see him before
the wedding. He's been fitted.

31:03.362 --> 31:07.230
Gianni's even finished the
white fedora he requested.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.868
That's him.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.736
This is real.

31:13.956 --> 31:16.038
And you're disappointed?

31:16.250 --> 31:19.742
No. I'm happy for them.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.419
It's just that I might
have to say goodbye.

31:22.631 --> 31:26.670
Get Kenzi. He'll be here soon.

31:32.808 --> 31:33.718
[sighs]

31:33.934 --> 31:36.016
It's not you I'm worried about.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.183
It's him.

31:37.396 --> 31:42.106
[phone rings]

31:47.740 --> 31:48.229
Um...

31:48.449 --> 31:49.939
[TAMSIN] Let me in!

31:50.826 --> 31:52.441
[TAMSIN] I know you're in there.

31:52.661 --> 31:56.529
Uh, cleaning. Kenzi no here.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.289
[TAMSIN] Oh.

31:59.502 --> 32:02.994
Uh, s-she come back. One hour.

32:03.214 --> 32:06.297
[TAMSIN] Oh, okay.
I'll be back later.

32:06.509 --> 32:07.999
Okay...

32:14.266 --> 32:16.882
[exhales heavily]

32:17.103 --> 32:17.717
[screams]

32:17.937 --> 32:20.929
[TAMSIN] This would
be so much easier...

32:21.148 --> 32:21.773
if you would just...

32:21.982 --> 32:23.893
--[KENZI] Séo Paulo sunset?
--[TAMS|N] ...open the door.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.771
How low do you go?

32:26.654 --> 32:29.066
Here's Tammy!

32:36.038 --> 32:37.323
And here's Bo.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.952
Isn't it customary to end
that sentence with "bitch"?

32:40.167 --> 32:42.249
You said it, crazy eyes. Not me.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.917
Time to deliver you.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.119
Well guess what?

32:45.339 --> 32:46.374
I'm not a package.

32:46.590 --> 32:49.957
We can do this the
easy way, or the hard way.

32:50.177 --> 32:53.135
Is there a medium option?

32:53.347 --> 32:54.006
[TAMSIN grunts]

32:54.223 --> 32:55.633
Hard it is.

32:57.268 --> 32:59.054
[laughing]

32:59.270 --> 33:06.984
[BOTH grunting]
[intense music]

33:07.194 --> 33:08.604
[TAMSIN grunts]

33:11.157 --> 33:11.566
[grunts]

33:11.782 --> 33:13.022
Get it together, woman.

33:13.242 --> 33:15.028
Let go of me!

33:29.550 --> 33:31.256
You don't get to
keep attacking us.

33:31.468 --> 33:33.800
To hurt me is
one thing, but Kenzi?

33:34.013 --> 33:36.299
This is why I didn't
want to come here.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.052
Hey. Talk to me.

33:39.268 --> 33:42.010
What did this place do to you?

33:42.229 --> 33:44.971
It's not what
Valhalla did to me.

33:46.609 --> 33:49.442
It's what I do in Valhalla.

33:49.653 --> 33:53.191
[TAMSIN crying] I don't
want you to see me like this.

33:56.202 --> 33:58.193
One more strike,
and you won't ever step foot

33:58.412 --> 34:00.323
into our lives again.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.075
I have to go find Kenzi.

34:06.295 --> 34:10.834
Wait. When you fed off of me,
and you said I tasted happy...

34:11.050 --> 34:12.381
Yeah, I know. You and Dyson.

34:12.593 --> 34:14.254
[TAMSIN] No it's--it's not that.

34:14.470 --> 34:19.089
For the first time in all
my lives, I have a family.

34:19.308 --> 34:21.094
[TAMSIN] This is my last life.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.677
I don't wanna
live it without you.

34:24.897 --> 34:29.140
[phone ringing]

34:29.360 --> 34:31.146
It's him.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.693
Hotel perv?

34:32.905 --> 34:34.190
[TAMSIN] No.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.398
The man who hired me.

34:37.618 --> 34:38.482
I thought it
was The Wanderer,

34:38.702 --> 34:41.569
but it's someone
way more powerful.

34:41.789 --> 34:43.654
[phone continues]

34:43.874 --> 34:47.287
He wanted me to deliver a
woman I didn't think could exist.

34:50.464 --> 34:51.965
But you do.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.713
He wants you, Bo.

34:58.847 --> 35:01.714
Well, he can leave a message.

35:01.934 --> 35:04.016
I have a wedding to get to.

35:12.653 --> 35:15.565
[KENZI] Um...
How white is--is too white?

35:15.781 --> 35:17.191
[BO] I love it.

35:17.408 --> 35:18.989
Look, you only get married
in your afterlife once.

35:19.201 --> 35:20.236
[BO] You might as
well do it right, right?

35:23.789 --> 35:25.620
She's in a time out.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.700
Okay, here. Something old.

35:28.919 --> 35:31.501
[BO] For a warrior.
From a warrior.

35:31.714 --> 35:32.999
Joan of Arc gave it to me.
I saw her in the lobby

35:33.215 --> 35:34.716
complaining about a
burnt smell in her room.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.210
Classic Joan.

35:36.427 --> 35:39.715
[BO] Something new.
Matches from the gift shop.

35:42.224 --> 35:44.465
Something borrowed.

35:57.448 --> 35:59.063
And I ran out of time
for something blue.

35:59.283 --> 36:00.523
Am I the worst bridesmaid?

36:00.743 --> 36:03.200
No. You're my something blue.

36:06.582 --> 36:09.824
Kenzi, I'm sorry that
I couldn't save Hale.

36:10.044 --> 36:12.080
And I'm sorry that I
wasn't there to save you.

36:12.296 --> 36:15.083
It was my turn to do the saving.
Can you give a girl that?

36:15.299 --> 36:17.255
But how many times
have you saved me?

36:18.552 --> 36:20.713
A few.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.090
Since we first met.

36:23.307 --> 36:26.265
You save me every single day.

36:26.477 --> 36:28.183
[B0] In ways that you
could never understand.

36:28.395 --> 36:31.353
In ways that I can
barely understand.

36:31.565 --> 36:33.681
You just did.

36:33.901 --> 36:36.017
And I want you
to be happy, I do.

36:36.236 --> 36:37.225
And I know it doesn't seem like it

36:37.446 --> 36:38.686
from the way I was
acting, but it's true.

36:38.906 --> 36:41.022
No, no. I know. I know.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.742
And I don't wanna
leave you here.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.945
I know.

36:48.165 --> 36:49.655
But you have to.

36:51.460 --> 36:52.950
I know.

37:04.848 --> 37:06.463
You're beautiful.

37:06.683 --> 37:07.513
You ready?

37:07.726 --> 37:08.511
To get married dead?

37:08.727 --> 37:10.888
Yeah. It's what every
little girl dreams about.

37:14.024 --> 37:16.060
Let's do this shit.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.085
I can't. I can't
do slow walking.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.881
Can I just run to him?

37:45.389 --> 37:46.219
Wait--stop.

37:46.432 --> 37:49.469
What? Why? We're
almost there. I think.

37:49.685 --> 37:51.266
Ijust... need to run
ahead and make sure

37:51.478 --> 37:53.059
everything's a-okay at the altar.

37:53.272 --> 37:56.014
Maid of honor duty.
You just, stay here, okay?

37:56.233 --> 37:58.019
[KENZI] Seriously? Okay, hurry.

38:33.604 --> 38:35.140
Hale?

38:50.871 --> 38:52.532
[FREYJA] I sent him back.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.158
[KENZI] What is this?

38:54.374 --> 38:57.707
[FREYJA] You walked into the
cinvat, closed the door to Hell.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.161
Tamsin brought your
soul here but you

39:00.380 --> 39:01.961
had already
promised yourself

39:02.174 --> 39:04.881
to another after-realm.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.503
You belong to him.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.335
Him who?

39:08.555 --> 39:10.011
My father.

39:12.226 --> 39:14.717
No, wait. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

39:15.979 --> 39:20.268
Send Kenzi home.
Take me instead.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.642
[B0] A soul for a soul.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.818
I am the one he wants.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.113
This was his plan all along.

39:28.325 --> 39:30.156
He knew that I would come.

39:30.369 --> 39:31.779
Yes.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.239
[TAMSIN] Stop!

39:35.707 --> 39:36.958
These two souls
can't be separated.

39:37.167 --> 39:38.623
Look who just
read the rule book.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.211
Bo comes wearing the
Helskér and is permitted

39:40.420 --> 39:42.285
to take home a soul
that is claimed to her.

39:42.506 --> 39:44.588
Kenzi's her claimed human.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.258
Bobo, I'm so sorry.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.552
No, this is not your fault.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.504
[KENZI]
I think it was him; Hale.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.715
I felt him. He was happy.

39:54.935 --> 39:56.471
Do you wanna stay?

39:58.188 --> 40:00.975
No. No it's not my time.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.102
I wanna go home with you.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.229
Reclaim me. Quick.

40:05.445 --> 40:08.232
I'm afraid we don't
see a claim here.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.404
Guard.

40:10.617 --> 40:11.697
No.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.696
I claim her!
I claim Kenzi Malikov!

40:13.912 --> 40:16.119
The deal was made before
the claim was restored.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.287
Oh, please keep her safe.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.456
Your wish will be fulfilled.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.750
No!

40:22.963 --> 40:25.295
[KENZI] No! No, Bo.

40:25.507 --> 40:27.873
Kenzi will be
returned to her body.

40:34.224 --> 40:36.886
[STACEY chuckles]

40:37.603 --> 40:41.095
Tamsin. Tam Tam.

40:41.315 --> 40:43.476
You tried. You always did.

40:43.692 --> 40:45.273
Just like when we
were in school together.

40:45.485 --> 40:47.737
But it's not enough.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.732
[STACEY] It's never enough.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.404
Screw you, Stacey.

40:51.617 --> 40:54.950
When will you realize
you are not special?

40:55.162 --> 40:56.493
You are just like one of us.

40:56.705 --> 40:59.788
I will never be like you.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.616
Valhalla 101.

41:02.836 --> 41:06.920
What does Freyja hate
more than anything, girls? Hm?

41:07.132 --> 41:08.668
Unbalanced books.

41:08.884 --> 41:10.249
Stay away from them!

41:10.469 --> 41:12.130
Can't.

41:12.346 --> 41:15.053
With Kenzi gone,
we're down a soul.

41:15.265 --> 41:17.005
Time for me to get another.

41:17.225 --> 41:18.931
[STACEY] One close
to the succubus' heart.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.681
No! No!

41:24.816 --> 41:26.556
Good luck.

41:30.614 --> 41:37.952
| navnet til sjelene
brakt frem til Valhalla,

41:38.163 --> 41:47.379
[LAUREN] Ia portene apenbarer
seg. Avslor. Avslor. Avslor!

41:52.761 --> 41:53.625
[FEMALE screaming]

41:53.845 --> 41:55.005
Bo?

41:55.222 --> 41:56.803
Or Kenzi.

42:02.646 --> 42:07.231
[DYSON growls]

42:18.495 --> 42:21.282
[VALKYRIE VOICE] Upon blessed
wings, our legions carry forth

42:21.498 --> 42:24.240
a human soul
back to her body,

42:24.459 --> 42:26.450
as requested by our leader.

42:26.670 --> 42:33.508
And you, Wolf, have trespassed
upon forbidden territory.

42:36.972 --> 42:39.429
[DYSON] Hey. Hey.

42:42.227 --> 42:43.637
Kenzi?

42:43.854 --> 42:45.219
Yeah.

42:45.439 --> 42:55.440
[eerie music]

43:05.709 --> 43:07.199
[KENZI] Help.

43:07.419 --> 43:17.420
[music continues]

43:18.180 --> 43:20.045
[BO] You want me?

43:20.265 --> 43:21.675
[grunts]

43:21.892 --> 43:23.757
Here I come.

43:23.977 --> 43:33.773
[elevator dinging]

43:35.989 --> 43:40.983
[ending theme]
