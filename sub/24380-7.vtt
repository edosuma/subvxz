WEBVTT

00:01.765 --> 00:03.839
I-I can't make this
Sundance short deadline.

00:03.840 --> 00:05.908
I had this prof in film school.

00:05.909 --> 00:08.778
He's one of the programmers
for the Tin Creek Film Festival.

00:08.779 --> 00:11.647
I'm still in contact with him.
You can hit him up.

00:11.648 --> 00:12.882
I'm leaving Hollywood. For good.

00:12.883 --> 00:14.650
You don't have to retire retire.

00:14.651 --> 00:15.851
You can just take a break.

00:15.852 --> 00:17.486
I'm thinking we should start

00:17.487 --> 00:18.721
a Trending Ocean in the East Coast.

00:18.722 --> 00:20.723
Here you go. It's an anonymous gift.

00:20.724 --> 00:23.492
I am supposed to give you this.

00:23.493 --> 00:24.760
Thanks. Hm.

00:24.761 --> 00:28.564
My studio is locking down
the rights to this manuscript.

00:28.565 --> 00:30.833
"Redemption Ridge" is gonna win
every Oscar it's up for.

00:30.834 --> 00:33.034
Why don't you come upstairs
for a drink?

00:34.938 --> 00:37.506
Our mom, she served
six years in prison

00:37.507 --> 00:38.541
for killing her boyfriend.

00:38.542 --> 00:39.775
But the thing is she didn't do it.

00:39.776 --> 00:42.744
I did.

00:49.653 --> 00:52.622
I've never done an "US Weekly"
cover shoot before

00:52.623 --> 00:55.625
or, you know,
any cover interview at all.

00:55.626 --> 00:57.860
Also, I, I made coffee,
but I didn't think..

00:57.861 --> 01:00.696
- Do you want tea? I can get...
- Coffee's fine.

01:00.697 --> 01:02.932
You seem nervous. Don't be.

01:02.933 --> 01:04.934
Just relax.

01:04.935 --> 01:05.935
Ready?

01:05.936 --> 01:07.703
One more second. I'm almost ready.

01:07.704 --> 01:10.506
Your boyfriend's
a screenwriter and filmmaker.

01:10.507 --> 01:13.609
You just wrapped a major motion
picture with a ton of buzz.

01:13.610 --> 01:14.910
What's it like to be a hot, young

01:14.911 --> 01:16.679
Hollywood power couple in the making?

01:16.680 --> 01:18.681
It's giving me an ulcer, okay?

01:18.682 --> 01:20.583
Uh, we-we're barely talking
and we've been

01:20.584 --> 01:21.717
tiptoeing around each other ever since

01:21.718 --> 01:23.519
I submitted the short to the festival.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.488
How do you and Jake stay connected

01:25.489 --> 01:26.689
in the midst of all this?

01:26.690 --> 01:28.791
I don't even know
how we got so disconnected.

01:28.792 --> 01:30.793
I'm listening, I'm supporting

01:30.794 --> 01:34.664
and I'm gently reminding you
that we have a plane to catch.

01:34.665 --> 01:35.798
It just seems weird
to be going to this

01:35.799 --> 01:36.832
film festival without her.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.634
Look, I know it's been hard on you two

01:38.635 --> 01:39.835
but maybe you can give her a call

01:39.836 --> 01:41.637
when we're on our way to the airport.

01:41.638 --> 01:42.638
Yeah? And say what?

01:42.639 --> 01:44.607
I, I don't know what to say to that.

01:44.608 --> 01:46.942
It looked like you were
getting close to Rainer Devon

01:46.943 --> 01:48.911
and then Jake Salt makes an entrance.

01:48.912 --> 01:51.614
People wanna know
how he swept you off your feet

01:51.615 --> 01:54.717
when you could've had a literal
leading man as your leading man.

01:54.718 --> 01:56.986
Yeah, of course, you know,
when he walked in

01:56.987 --> 01:59.522
it was the the most
romantic thing, sure

01:59.523 --> 02:02.525
but i-it was also just..

02:02.526 --> 02:03.793
...my best friend talking to me.

02:03.794 --> 02:06.861
An-a-and it didn't feel like a choice.

02:08.865 --> 02:11.866
Who wouldn't wanna be
with their best friend?

02:12.803 --> 02:15.604
She should be coming with us.

02:15.605 --> 02:17.705
I should be with him.

02:18.742 --> 02:20.609
'What was that, Ms. Townsen?'

02:20.610 --> 02:22.745
Uh.. I'm sorry.

02:22.746 --> 02:25.781
I'm gonna.. I'll be two seconds.
I'll be right back.

02:29.753 --> 02:31.654
Hey, Joanie, okay.

02:31.655 --> 02:32.788
I know this is really last minute

02:32.789 --> 02:34.757
but, can you please
use your super agent skills

02:34.758 --> 02:38.661
and reschedule this "US Weekly"
cover shoot for another day?

02:38.662 --> 02:41.029
I, I.. I have to get
to Jake's film festival.

02:41.504 --> 02:47.323
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:52.809 --> 02:54.610
'Paige still hasn't
called me back yet.'

02:54.611 --> 02:56.879
Call her again
after we go to the theatre.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.548
It helps me to not be nervous
if I go somewhere important

02:59.549 --> 03:00.716
the night before, and then on the day

03:00.717 --> 03:02.651
I can relax, and you may..

03:02.652 --> 03:05.654
Call her. I'll wait.

03:05.655 --> 03:09.558
No, Billy, it's not just Paige.
It's just..

03:09.559 --> 03:11.460
Look, Sundance was the goal.

03:11.461 --> 03:14.730
Instead, I'm premiering
i-in Tin Creek, Utah

03:14.731 --> 03:16.565
twenty miles away from the action

03:16.566 --> 03:17.900
buried in a short film competition

03:17.901 --> 03:20.535
that I'm beginning to think
nobody's coming to see.

03:21.705 --> 03:23.539
Look. Right there.

03:23.540 --> 03:24.740
Your name is already in lights.

03:24.741 --> 03:26.908
You're already ahead of the game.

03:27.644 --> 03:28.911
Yeah.

03:28.912 --> 03:30.778
'In really small writing.'

03:31.648 --> 03:32.948
But I get your point.

03:32.949 --> 03:34.817
It is pretty awesome.

03:38.622 --> 03:39.688
What was that?

03:39.689 --> 03:40.723
If you ever stop complaining

03:40.724 --> 03:42.790
you're gonna wanna remember this.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.830
Yeah, you're right.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.634
Take one more?

03:53.670 --> 03:55.603
Stand over there.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.911
Okay, say "Stealing Georgia."

04:01.912 --> 04:02.912
Stealing Georgia.

04:06.850 --> 04:08.717
'By the time you
get back from New York'

04:08.718 --> 04:09.852
'everything should be done.'

04:09.853 --> 04:12.588
'I finished packing up today'

04:12.589 --> 04:15.825
and movers will come tomorrow..

04:15.826 --> 04:18.827
I think it officially
hits the market on Thursday.

04:18.829 --> 04:21.463
After that, I'm pretty much
on my way to New York.

04:21.464 --> 04:23.866
Hm. Well, hurry. I miss you.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.668
And I'm excited to get Trending Ocean

04:25.669 --> 04:27.703
finally up and running
on the East Coast.

04:28.939 --> 04:30.672
What was that?

04:31.775 --> 04:33.809
Nothing.

04:33.810 --> 04:36.679
Just knocked a frame off the dresser.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.947
Hey, not to pick at a scab

04:37.948 --> 04:40.883
but, are you gonna talk
to Jordan before you leave?

04:40.884 --> 04:42.618
Hadn't planned on it.

04:42.619 --> 04:43.853
I'm leaving his shit in the courtyard.

04:43.854 --> 04:45.888
Why are you even bringing him up?

04:45.889 --> 04:47.890
'Come on, you saw his GMA interview.'

04:47.891 --> 04:49.658
It takes a lot of guts
for someone to open up

04:49.659 --> 04:50.860
on national television.

04:50.861 --> 04:52.494
'That's not guts.'

04:52.495 --> 04:53.896
'That's PR 101.'

04:53.897 --> 04:55.798
You mess up, hit the talk shows.

04:55.799 --> 04:57.967
Apologize to a live studio audience.

04:57.968 --> 05:00.903
Jordan's playing the game
so that his fans in the press

05:00.904 --> 05:02.872
don't turn against him.

05:02.873 --> 05:05.708
More Hollywood crap
I can't wait to leave behind.

05:05.709 --> 05:07.509
Okay, well, look,
I've gotta get into a meeting

05:07.510 --> 05:08.777
so I'll talk to you later.

05:08.778 --> 05:11.614
- Can we FaceTime?
- 'Sure.'

05:11.615 --> 05:13.549
Can we facetime naked?

05:13.550 --> 05:15.751
Gotta go. I'll talk to you later.

05:19.823 --> 05:20.923
Ooh!

05:24.527 --> 05:26.762
'Hey.'

05:26.763 --> 05:28.830
'Oh, go ahead, Luca,
I'll be up in a minute.'

05:29.799 --> 05:30.900
Back from the Bahamas?

05:30.901 --> 05:32.668
Yeah.

05:32.669 --> 05:35.471
Pablo and I made a pretty good album.

05:35.472 --> 05:39.541
Dude, Lenny's studio is the most
chill place I have ever been.

05:39.542 --> 05:42.478
Uh-huh. Saw the flowers.

05:42.479 --> 05:44.879
Yeah. Pablo and I
are taking things next level.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.583
Come here.

05:51.655 --> 05:52.888
I saw your GMA interview.

05:52.889 --> 05:55.591
That was so brave, J.

05:55.592 --> 05:57.593
I am so proud of you.

05:57.594 --> 06:00.796
Well, Maricel helped me
make the decision to go on.

06:00.797 --> 06:04.499
Maricel? Is that the girl you
took to Rainer's fundraiser?

06:06.436 --> 06:07.636
Good.

06:07.637 --> 06:09.872
Yeah, I'm glad you have
someone supporting you.

06:09.873 --> 06:12.641
I heard there's like
an investigation or something.

06:12.642 --> 06:15.811
State attorney general put
a couple of Chicago DAs on it.

06:15.812 --> 06:17.579
Jordan, that's serious.

06:17.580 --> 06:19.647
I've got my legal team in place, so..

06:22.585 --> 06:25.587
Okay. Yeah, well, hey,
if you guys are around tonight

06:25.588 --> 06:26.689
I'm having a listing party here

06:26.690 --> 06:28.524
at the Bixby. You should come too.

06:28.525 --> 06:30.793
- Take your mind off things.
- I can't.

06:30.794 --> 06:32.828
Rainer's booting me out of the
beach house. He's selling it.

06:32.829 --> 06:35.564
So, his whole
"leaving Hollywood" thing

06:35.565 --> 06:36.665
that's for real?

06:36.666 --> 06:38.500
I guess.

06:38.501 --> 06:41.704
Anyway, I got to get moving.
It's just, uh..

06:41.705 --> 06:43.739
Well, thanks for the invite.

06:43.740 --> 06:45.674
Yeah. Yeah, maybe another time.

06:45.675 --> 06:46.775
- Yeah.
- Hey.

06:49.579 --> 06:51.513
I would love to meet her.

06:58.855 --> 07:00.556
You know what? I just can't help it.

07:00.557 --> 07:01.790
I'm obsessed with this

07:01.791 --> 07:05.594
sous vide chicken
and butter lettuce salad.

07:05.595 --> 07:08.430
Okay, good.
I will have the same thing.

07:08.431 --> 07:09.832
You haven't even looked at the menu.

07:09.833 --> 07:12.568
You know, you also
haven't looked at me

07:12.569 --> 07:14.503
since we sat down.

07:14.504 --> 07:15.804
I apologize.

07:15.805 --> 07:17.673
Hm. Business thing, okay?

07:17.674 --> 07:18.907
So, how are you?

07:20.677 --> 07:22.745
- What is going on with you?
- Oh.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.781
No, "Redemption Ridge"
is falling apart.

07:25.782 --> 07:27.483
'I mean, I am sitting here
and I'm waiting'

07:27.484 --> 07:28.484
'for signed paperwork'

07:28.485 --> 07:29.885
Marvin Dunwoody goes AWOL

07:29.886 --> 07:31.687
and I think somebody at the publisher

07:31.688 --> 07:34.690
I think they slipped a few
extra copies out around town.

07:34.691 --> 07:36.625
You know, I'm sure
her agent or manager...

07:36.626 --> 07:38.594
No, no, I'm dealing with her directly.

07:38.595 --> 07:40.796
She doesn't have reps.
She doesn't have a cellphone.

07:40.797 --> 07:41.797
She doesn't have e-mail.

07:41.798 --> 07:44.500
No, I call her house, I send faxes.

07:44.501 --> 07:47.669
Faxes? What, is she living
in the Dark Ages?

07:47.670 --> 07:49.638
Boone County, West Virginia.

07:49.639 --> 07:51.740
The kind lady at the county library

07:51.741 --> 07:54.576
drives the faxes out to her.

07:54.577 --> 07:57.579
- That's so sweet.
- 'I wanna close this deal.'

07:57.580 --> 07:58.781
Hm.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.781
I promised Sloane.

08:01.885 --> 08:03.519
Oh, right.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.821
Okay, uh, order me the chicken
and I will be right back.

08:05.822 --> 08:06.855
Uh.

08:06.856 --> 08:08.824
We'll have two butter lettuce salads

08:08.825 --> 08:11.593
tarragon dressing on the side,
chicken, white meat only

08:11.594 --> 08:12.694
and make it snappy.

08:12.695 --> 08:15.464
I've got an appointment
right after lunch.

08:18.902 --> 08:20.903
'...said they
were gonna need us tonight.'

08:20.904 --> 08:21.904
- 'It's gonna be tough.'
- 'Sam said the..'

08:21.905 --> 08:22.905
Jake.

08:22.906 --> 08:24.640
Hey, people really seem to like it.

08:24.641 --> 08:25.774
People loved it.

08:25.775 --> 08:27.709
I got three business cards
from casting directors

08:27.710 --> 08:30.579
that came down from Park City
just to see the screening.

08:30.580 --> 08:31.780
That's three more than I expected.

08:31.781 --> 08:34.782
- Did you meet any studio execs?
- Oh, let's take a picture.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.522
Remember, it's Jake Salt,
as in salt and pepper

08:40.523 --> 08:41.890
Billy with a "Y," London like the town

08:41.890 --> 08:43.792
and Schwartz like the guy
who wrote "Wicked."

08:43.793 --> 08:45.461
Hyphenate it.

08:45.462 --> 08:46.528
- What are you doing?
- 'Yo, check it out.'

08:46.529 --> 08:47.629
Making sure they print our names right

08:47.630 --> 08:49.531
so people can find us.

08:49.532 --> 08:50.532
'Sorry, folks, gotta go.'

08:50.533 --> 08:51.733
What?

08:51.734 --> 08:53.735
Uh, that's obviously somebody big.

08:53.736 --> 08:55.838
You think they drove
all the way down from Sundance?

08:55.839 --> 08:58.841
- 'No, I can't see.'
- 'Excuse me, excuse me.'

09:00.643 --> 09:01.777
'Over here.'

09:01.778 --> 09:03.645
- Hey, could you look this way?
- He's up here now.

09:03.646 --> 09:07.449
- Get a shot.
- Oh, make way, please.

09:07.450 --> 09:08.684
I think this person came a lot farther

09:08.685 --> 09:10.719
than Park City to see your movie.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.454
I can't see. Who is it?

09:15.592 --> 09:17.559
Surprise.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.894
- 'Paige, look this way.'
- 'Paige.'

09:18.895 --> 09:21.529
- 'Paige..'
- 'Paige, this way, come on.'

09:24.332 --> 09:26.433
And I was thinking

09:26.434 --> 09:29.470
since we're here for a few more days

09:29.471 --> 09:31.538
and it's all

09:31.539 --> 09:34.408
cozy and snugglicious

09:34.409 --> 09:36.410
we could have the best
winter date ever.

09:36.411 --> 09:39.379
Okay. I'm talking
snowboarding, dinners

09:39.380 --> 09:43.350
and my agent got us screening
passes to a movie at Sundance.

09:43.351 --> 09:44.485
Hey, this all sounds great
but, Paige...

09:44.486 --> 09:45.552
It's all good

09:45.553 --> 09:48.489
because I really hope that

09:48.490 --> 09:49.623
all this will maybe make up

09:49.624 --> 09:51.792
for me not coming with you
in the first place.

09:51.793 --> 09:55.562
I know that you're not there there

09:55.563 --> 09:59.433
but, I mean, we're still
half an hour from Park City.

09:59.434 --> 10:01.534
We could go and enjoy it.

10:03.605 --> 10:05.839
It sounds like you planned
a lot of fun stuff.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.408
But there're some panels
I wanted to see

10:08.409 --> 10:10.844
and some people I should
really try and meet, you know?

10:10.845 --> 10:13.579
- I'm here for work.
- Mm-hm, I get it.

10:14.616 --> 10:17.451
It's okay. I'll just, um..

10:17.452 --> 10:20.420
We don't have to go snowboarding.

10:20.421 --> 10:22.790
And I'll just dump
the passes for "Luminescent."

10:22.791 --> 10:26.393
H-hold on, like, "Luminescent,"
like the biggest movie

10:26.394 --> 10:27.494
at Sundance "Luminescent?"

10:27.495 --> 10:29.630
- Mm-hm.
- Nobody has passes to that.

10:29.631 --> 10:31.698
We do. Come on.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.468
The two of us, a romantic evening.

10:34.469 --> 10:36.737
We can.. Oh, we could
have a great dinner

10:36.738 --> 10:39.840
and then we will watch a great movie

10:39.841 --> 10:42.709
and then we can get drinks after.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.445
And then you can go back
work, work, work, work

10:45.446 --> 10:46.680
all you want.

10:46.681 --> 10:49.582
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

10:55.657 --> 10:57.723
I'm really glad you're here.

10:58.793 --> 11:00.493
Me too.

11:08.369 --> 11:10.537
Can we please go back to the hotel?

11:10.538 --> 11:13.773
And get all snuggly
under those sheets?

11:15.000 --> 11:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:24.485 --> 11:26.552
Aah!

11:31.426 --> 11:33.727
- Sorry, I, uh, was..
- Oh, my God.

11:33.728 --> 11:35.863
I-I-I figured you're out. I, um..

11:37.832 --> 11:40.667
Uh, are you guys sharing a room?

11:40.668 --> 11:42.436
Uh, C-C-Cassie had to bail on..

11:42.437 --> 11:45.405
- We just figured we'd take...
- It's no big deal.

11:45.406 --> 11:46.874
I'll just get us another room

11:46.875 --> 11:48.742
and, uh, you can have this one.

11:48.743 --> 11:50.577
Uh, with Sundance

11:50.578 --> 11:53.747
and in the middle of ski season,
everything is sold out

11:53.748 --> 11:56.750
I think the three of us
are just gonna have to

11:56.751 --> 11:58.785
make the best of it.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.621
I was just on my way out.

12:00.622 --> 12:02.522
I mean, if you guys wanna, you know..

12:02.523 --> 12:04.558
- You can maybe till, like, six.
- You don't have to go.

12:04.559 --> 12:07.561
Oh. What's at six?

12:07.562 --> 12:10.497
Uh, we're going to
the screening of "Luminescent."

12:10.498 --> 12:12.799
And the cocktail reception
afterwards should be pretty fun.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.701
Are you serious?

12:14.702 --> 12:17.437
Wait, P. G. Carmichael
produced it, right?

12:17.438 --> 12:18.672
I saw him speak at NYU.

12:18.673 --> 12:21.375
He's like the godfather of indie film.

12:21.376 --> 12:23.644
I mean, he can do incredible
things for "Stealing Georgia."

12:23.645 --> 12:25.746
We have to try and meet him.

12:25.747 --> 12:29.449
Which is why I wanted all of us to go.

12:29.450 --> 12:30.484
- Paige, I thought we wanted t...
- 'No.'

12:30.485 --> 12:31.818
That's why I had Joanie
get us the tickets.

12:31.819 --> 12:35.589
I knew there'd be great people
for you guys to meet

12:35.590 --> 12:37.424
and, you know, work the room..

12:37.425 --> 12:38.592
It'll be really good for the movie.

12:38.593 --> 12:40.527
Oh, um.. Wait, it's almost three.

12:40.528 --> 12:42.529
Do you still wanna head up
that Q and A or..

12:42.530 --> 12:44.464
Oh, God, I almost forgot.

12:45.466 --> 12:47.534
Thanks, Paige. See you in a bit.

12:47.535 --> 12:49.769
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:51.673 --> 12:54.541
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.543
I-I.. Can.. Is it cool if I just...

12:56.544 --> 12:59.446
Yeah. No, go, go. Go to work.

12:59.447 --> 13:01.815
Um, I will stay here

13:01.816 --> 13:05.484
and figure out
how to get another pass.

13:06.554 --> 13:09.555
- I mean, she just assumed..
- It's okay. I get it.

13:22.570 --> 13:24.738
Not done yet? I'm trying
to get the house listed.

13:24.739 --> 13:26.806
Few more hours won't matter.

13:29.744 --> 13:31.845
What did you think would happen

13:31.846 --> 13:34.414
admitting what you did on TV?

13:34.415 --> 13:36.817
I just.. I needed to be done with it.

13:36.818 --> 13:37.818
With all of it.

13:37.819 --> 13:39.519
You're not done

13:39.520 --> 13:41.520
by a long shot, bro.

13:43.491 --> 13:46.593
I just hope you're ready
to answer for what you've done.

13:46.594 --> 13:48.861
'The Chicago DA
won't let you off the hook.'

13:50.698 --> 13:51.831
Will you?

13:57.872 --> 14:00.774
Sorry. My lunch went late.

14:00.775 --> 14:04.477
Now, what do you say
we get in bed together?

14:06.581 --> 14:07.581
Now, when you say
"get in bed together"

14:07.582 --> 14:08.815
'that's, like, Hollywood talk, right?'

14:08.816 --> 14:11.551
'Cause I'm a Christian woman.

14:11.552 --> 14:13.820
No, I just mean
we'd be in business together.

14:13.821 --> 14:16.390
'Marva, just sign a few papers'

14:16.391 --> 14:18.392
collect a big, fat pay check

14:18.393 --> 14:20.494
and let me make "Redemption Ridge"

14:20.495 --> 14:22.729
into an Oscar-winning movie.

14:22.730 --> 14:24.531
Okay.

14:33.104 --> 14:36.267
And like I said, you know,
charge anything to the room.

14:36.268 --> 14:38.469
Filet mignon, movies, minibar and..

14:38.470 --> 14:40.638
You know, there is a great spa
here that you might wanna take...

14:40.639 --> 14:42.340
I got some of them fancy foot rubs.

14:42.341 --> 14:43.708
They were real nice,
thank you so much.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.576
I charged them to the room.

14:49.576 --> 14:50.648
_

14:50.649 --> 14:52.650
You know, that's just
all boilerplate...

14:52.651 --> 14:54.718
Just one more minute.

14:57.323 --> 15:01.459
Uh, everything looks
right on level here, Ms. Nina.

15:03.228 --> 15:05.330
If I could, uh

15:05.331 --> 15:07.265
speak real plain with you.

15:07.266 --> 15:08.433
Well, what is it?

15:08.434 --> 15:10.368
Well, um, I was hoping

15:10.369 --> 15:12.303
that there would be
a little something in here

15:12.304 --> 15:14.439
that says that I can
write the screenplay.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.307
You'd like..

15:16.308 --> 15:17.308
Well, that's..

15:20.197 --> 15:21.297
_

15:22.715 --> 15:26.384
To be real plain, no.

15:26.385 --> 15:29.587
No, there's just too much
at stake for me in this project

15:29.588 --> 15:32.323
and I won't take a chance on someone

15:32.324 --> 15:33.691
who's never written for the screen.

15:33.692 --> 15:36.327
Right, I understand.

15:36.328 --> 15:38.730
But, you know,
I have taken the liberty

15:38.731 --> 15:40.698
of cutting a check

15:40.699 --> 15:43.468
and if you sign right now

15:43.469 --> 15:44.702
we can send you back to Boone County

15:44.703 --> 15:47.571
with a pocket full of change.

15:48.674 --> 15:50.475
You know what, I'm, I'm just gonna

15:50.476 --> 15:53.344
look over these papers
one more time, and, uh..

15:53.345 --> 15:54.512
If you wanna wring a chicken's neck

15:54.513 --> 15:56.514
you gotta twist it twice, right?

15:56.515 --> 15:58.582
I'm gonna call you
later today, though.

16:02.488 --> 16:05.388
- Don't forget your fancy pen.
- Keep it.

16:06.492 --> 16:09.360
Hey, lucky Tangerines,
let's get this party started.

16:09.361 --> 16:10.395
Yeah.

16:10.396 --> 16:12.463
After desserts

16:12.464 --> 16:14.665
you guys are going to help me tease

16:14.666 --> 16:16.634
my first single of the album

16:16.635 --> 16:19.470
on Facebook live.

16:19.471 --> 16:22.306
It's called "Block That
Business," and I'm telling you...

16:22.307 --> 16:23.641
Oh, my God, I can't wait to hear it.

16:23.642 --> 16:26.411
I bet this new single's
gonna be such a bop.

16:26.412 --> 16:28.312
Yes, it is.

16:28.313 --> 16:31.616
Are you finally clapping back
at that foul hussy Alexis Glenn?

16:31.617 --> 16:33.384
Uh, no, come on.

16:33.385 --> 16:34.685
Come on, you guys know
I'm not about that drama.

16:34.686 --> 16:37.321
I read online that your new single

16:37.322 --> 16:38.556
is all shade.

16:38.557 --> 16:39.657
Can you confirm that the song

16:39.658 --> 16:41.459
is about that Twitter beef
she started?

16:41.460 --> 16:43.361
No, no, my songs are inspired

16:43.362 --> 16:45.363
by many different things
in my personal life.

16:45.364 --> 16:48.533
Alexis is garbage.
And we hate her reality show.

16:48.534 --> 16:52.303
Okay. Tonight is not about Alexis.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.672
It's about the music..

16:54.673 --> 16:57.542
...and about connecting
with my Tangerines!

16:57.543 --> 17:01.646
'Cause you guys are
my main squeezes, m-kay?

17:01.647 --> 17:04.549
Speaking of music, I have a new friend

17:04.550 --> 17:06.451
who wanted to give you guys
a special treat.

17:06.452 --> 17:08.653
Moneygems headphones?

17:08.654 --> 17:10.621
So, basically, you're confirming

17:10.622 --> 17:13.257
that you and Pablo Money are cuffed.

17:13.258 --> 17:15.492
I'm confirming that Pablo is generous

17:15.493 --> 17:19.262
and we should thank him for
these free Bluetooth headphones.

17:19.263 --> 17:20.330
I feel you, queen.

17:20.332 --> 17:21.531
You have to keep this
strictly off the record.

17:21.532 --> 17:24.501
Okay, guys, get ready, okay?

17:25.537 --> 17:27.305
Hey, P, I'm sitting here

17:27.306 --> 17:30.608
with some of my new friends
who wanna holler at you.

17:30.609 --> 17:33.376
Thank you, Pablo Money!

17:36.248 --> 17:38.416
Oh, hey, I'm waiting
on some paperwork. What's up?

17:38.417 --> 17:40.551
Ah, just wanted to pop in.

17:40.552 --> 17:43.521
You don't pop, Alan.
You're here for something.

17:43.522 --> 17:44.722
I assume you're going to tell me

17:44.723 --> 17:45.723
about your engagement announcement

17:45.724 --> 17:47.558
in the trades tomorrow.

17:47.559 --> 17:48.726
'Congratulations, by the way.'

17:48.727 --> 17:49.727
How did you...

17:49.728 --> 17:52.530
I was placing my usual order

17:52.531 --> 17:53.731
for white orchids

17:53.732 --> 17:57.335
and they were out because
of an engagement photoshoot.

17:57.336 --> 18:01.439
So I toggle a few
of my sources at the reporter.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.208
Well, you're stalking me.
I'm flattered.

18:04.209 --> 18:07.278
I helped you pick out the ring.

18:07.279 --> 18:10.281
Color me not-at-all-sideswiped.

18:11.550 --> 18:13.684
But you asked her to an Angels'
game? You're a Dodger fan.

18:13.685 --> 18:16.287
Y-yeah, but she's from Anaheim.

18:16.288 --> 18:18.322
They were up two runs, so, you know

18:18.323 --> 18:19.657
felt like a special occasion.

18:19.658 --> 18:22.460
I'm actually here
because accounting noticed

18:22.461 --> 18:25.296
a couple left-field charges
on your corporate card.

18:25.297 --> 18:28.232
Hotel suites, spa packages..

18:28.233 --> 18:29.667
Yeah, I'm doing a little
research on a project

18:29.668 --> 18:31.235
set in a luxury hotel.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.603
And the Marva Dunwoody that you bought

18:32.604 --> 18:34.405
first-class air fare for.

18:34.406 --> 18:35.573
That's not the same Marva Dunwoody

18:35.574 --> 18:36.607
that my sources tell me

18:36.608 --> 18:39.243
is about to ink a deal

18:39.244 --> 18:40.578
with Steve Silver, is it?

18:40.579 --> 18:42.480
Why are you spending
so much of my money

18:42.481 --> 18:44.482
to double cross
your little yoga buddy?

18:44.483 --> 18:46.684
I can do yoga
with whoever I want, Alan.

18:46.685 --> 18:49.554
- And Steve's a friend.
- I thought you hated that guy.

18:49.555 --> 18:51.656
Steve Silver's a
bigger jerk than I am.

18:51.657 --> 18:54.392
He used to be. He's changed.

18:54.393 --> 18:56.260
And why do you even care anyway?

18:56.261 --> 18:59.463
Come on, Nina. Do you like this guy?

18:59.464 --> 19:01.566
It's new.

19:01.567 --> 19:04.202
But it's good.

19:04.203 --> 19:05.570
It's really, really good.

19:05.571 --> 19:08.339
Then what are you doing?

19:08.340 --> 19:11.676
Look, I've wrecked a lot
of relationships over business.

19:11.677 --> 19:13.644
Trina and I, uh..

19:13.645 --> 19:16.247
I am trying to be happy for once.

19:16.248 --> 19:19.316
And, as a friend, I wanna
see you be happy too.

19:19.685 --> 19:22.419
So tell him the truth..

19:23.422 --> 19:25.488
...before it's too late.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.627
That's what I popped in to say.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.503
Dude, why are you taking my board?

19:39.504 --> 19:42.340
This one's mine. I got it
out of the storage room.

19:42.341 --> 19:44.675
Is the light burnt out?
Grabbed the wrong one?

19:44.676 --> 19:46.544
Rainer, you taught me
how to surf on this board.

19:46.545 --> 19:49.447
- That I lent you.
- That you gave to me.

19:49.448 --> 19:50.681
Remember?

19:50.682 --> 19:53.251
- After we booked "Backsplash."
- Whatever.

19:53.252 --> 19:55.353
No, no, Nina took us to Val Surf, bro.

19:55.354 --> 19:57.520
We picked this one as a gift,
together.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.695
Fine. It's yours if you want it.

20:04.696 --> 20:06.697
Leave my key on the counter
when you're done.

20:06.698 --> 20:09.600
What are you doing? Is that how
you're gonna end our friendship?

20:09.601 --> 20:12.603
I let you drag me
to your rehab hill twice.

20:12.604 --> 20:14.672
And I stuck with you
because you kept my secret.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.674
You had my back, we had a bond.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.443
Hey, who the hell are you?

20:19.444 --> 20:20.478
What are you doing in my house?

20:20.479 --> 20:22.379
- Jordan Michaels?
- 'Yes.'

20:23.615 --> 20:25.682
- You've been served.
- What?

20:28.654 --> 20:30.554
I'm being subpoenaed.

20:30.555 --> 20:33.324
I have to appear
at the DA's office in Chicago.

20:33.325 --> 20:35.458
Wh-what do I do?

20:38.297 --> 20:39.529
Good luck with that.

20:53.612 --> 20:55.746
- I mean, that's him, right?
- Mm-hm.

20:55.747 --> 20:58.749
Oh, there's an opening. Go. Go!

20:58.750 --> 21:00.618
So how well do you know this guy?

21:00.619 --> 21:02.453
I snuck into a graduate seminar.

21:02.454 --> 21:03.654
I never met him met him.

21:03.655 --> 21:05.356
It's cool if I just
walk up to him, right?

21:05.357 --> 21:07.591
- Jake Salt?
- Mr. Carmichael? Hi.

21:07.592 --> 21:09.260
Ah, P.T.

21:09.261 --> 21:10.695
I didn't make it
to your screening at Tin Creek

21:10.696 --> 21:12.296
but I sent my second assistant.

21:12.297 --> 21:14.465
Oh, and you,
I heard great things about.

21:14.466 --> 21:15.633
Billy London-Schwartz.

21:15.634 --> 21:17.635
Yes, thank you.

21:17.636 --> 21:20.338
By the way, "Luminescent"
was a beautiful film.

21:20.339 --> 21:22.406
Thank you. It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

21:22.407 --> 21:25.509
Though I have to say,
I thought "Sleeping Georgia"

21:25.510 --> 21:28.346
was going to be
a feature-length film, no?

21:28.347 --> 21:30.648
Uh, uh, it's "Stealing Georgia"
and, I mean, yeah

21:30.649 --> 21:33.651
I mean, that was, that was the
plan originally, but, uh, how...

21:33.652 --> 21:35.753
Actually, it was my daughter's
interest in this young lady

21:35.754 --> 21:37.621
that put you first on my radar.

21:37.622 --> 21:40.524
You're the famous girl from, uh,
the open call, right?

21:40.525 --> 21:42.293
Yeah. Hi, Paige.

21:42.294 --> 21:43.327
My daughter follows

21:43.328 --> 21:45.463
all that Tinsel town chatter
on the blogs.

21:45.464 --> 21:48.498
At the end of the day,
Billy was the smarter choice.

21:50.402 --> 21:53.437
Um, ahem, we would love to,
uh, discuss financing

21:53.438 --> 21:55.539
and Jake still wants to finish
"Stealing Georgia" and...

21:55.540 --> 21:59.543
Um, what did you mean
when you said "smarter choice?"

21:59.544 --> 22:02.413
Oh, I meant no offense, to be
honest, I can't truly judge.

22:02.414 --> 22:03.514
I've never really seen your work.

22:03.515 --> 22:05.349
Look, it's just one guy
with an opinion.

22:05.350 --> 22:08.252
But until someone sees,
they're kind of "Locked."

22:08.253 --> 22:10.388
Paige is just famous for being famous.

22:10.389 --> 22:11.655
I think that would
have distracted people

22:11.656 --> 22:13.556
from your filmmaking, Jake.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.695
Um, well, I'm gonna
let you guys talk shop

22:17.696 --> 22:20.464
and I'm gonna go outside for some air.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.701
- Very nice to meet you.
- You too.

22:23.702 --> 22:26.303
I'd love for the both of you
to meet some people back here.

22:26.304 --> 22:27.570
Come on over.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.275
This way, please.

22:31.276 --> 22:32.510
Smile.

22:32.511 --> 22:34.578
'Excuse me. Move away.'

22:34.579 --> 22:36.412
'Jake?'

22:51.630 --> 22:55.744
Did you just not care that
I wanted this role for Sloane?

22:55.785 --> 22:59.421
You said he was a liability
and that you couldn't ensure him

22:59.422 --> 23:01.623
but I can absorb that risk

23:01.624 --> 23:04.493
and still give Sloane
the supporting role.

23:04.494 --> 23:07.829
No, I wanted to give her
that role. She is my daughter.

23:07.830 --> 23:10.564
He is my son.

23:11.534 --> 23:14.369
I got us this nice bottle of cabernet.

23:14.370 --> 23:16.572
So, let's just go back
to your house like we planned

23:16.573 --> 23:18.740
and open a bottle of wine..

23:18.741 --> 23:21.476
You think a screw-top

23:21.477 --> 23:24.646
wine is gonna fix this?

23:27.850 --> 23:29.750
Oh, is it..

23:31.788 --> 23:33.888
It's not even a decent vintage.

23:35.491 --> 23:36.858
Okay, look, I know you're upset

23:36.859 --> 23:39.661
but I, I'm sorry.

23:39.662 --> 23:42.497
I don't want your apology.

23:42.498 --> 23:43.732
I don't want your crappy wine.

23:43.733 --> 23:45.434
Look, I did this in a way

23:45.435 --> 23:46.868
so that we could both
get what we want.

23:46.869 --> 23:49.471
Rainer would stay here,
I'd make sure he's okay.

23:49.472 --> 23:51.540
You keep your promise
to your daughter.

23:51.541 --> 23:54.509
Come on, Steve,
we can work through this.

23:54.510 --> 23:55.743
We?

23:56.713 --> 23:57.945
There is no we, Nina.

24:00.683 --> 24:01.783
Steve?

24:01.784 --> 24:03.652
Get off..

24:03.653 --> 24:06.587
...my damn lot.

24:25.475 --> 24:27.842
'Who the hell is
Mirandina Pictures?' _

24:30.780 --> 24:32.447
Thanks for keeping quiet.

24:32.448 --> 24:36.385
Well, I think I've had
enough of Hollywood

24:36.386 --> 24:37.786
for a little while.

24:37.787 --> 24:39.755
Of course.

24:39.756 --> 24:42.456
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

24:44.861 --> 24:47.462
Have a safe flight.

24:54.837 --> 24:59.441
Ah, Alissa in Philly,
"Tangey is my q.."

24:59.442 --> 25:00.676
Thank you, baby girl.

25:00.677 --> 25:04.545
Okay, let's take Mariana
in Brazil is feelin' it.

25:13.690 --> 25:16.857
Yeah, can you guys lay off
the negativity, please?

25:20.630 --> 25:21.762
Thanks.

25:22.799 --> 25:25.600
But some of these comments
are really awful.

25:25.601 --> 25:28.403
I mean, "Alexis Glenn is fugly."

25:28.404 --> 25:31.406
"Alexis Glenn should quit acting
'cause she sucks."

25:31.407 --> 25:34.576
"I wish Alexis Glenn would die?"

25:34.577 --> 25:37.379
Is that, is that funny to you?

25:37.380 --> 25:39.381
Are you guys doing this?

25:39.382 --> 25:40.602
We're just showing you love.

25:41.718 --> 25:43.717
Okay, listen.

25:45.621 --> 25:48.522
Put your phones down. I'm serious.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.594
Look, I'm not trying to turn my fans

25:52.595 --> 25:55.797
into some kind
of digital wolf pack, you guys.

25:55.798 --> 26:00.368
And to everyone else out there,
let me make this crystal.

26:00.369 --> 26:03.604
You can't show me love
by hating on others, okay?

26:05.408 --> 26:08.710
Thank you so much for coming.
I appreciate it.

26:08.711 --> 26:11.412
Shut it down.
The event is officially over.

26:16.519 --> 26:19.554
Jordan? J?

26:19.555 --> 26:22.624
Jordan? Is everything okay?

26:22.625 --> 26:24.693
Alright, fine. I'm going to jail.

26:24.694 --> 26:26.427
What?

26:28.431 --> 26:31.432
Paige, whatever that guy said,
it doesn't matter.

26:37.707 --> 26:39.440
Paige?

27:20.094 --> 27:23.196
It's all over Deadline, the trades.

27:23.197 --> 27:24.430
Mirandina Pictures?

27:24.431 --> 27:25.431
I'm assuming you threw together

27:25.432 --> 27:27.300
some shell production company.

27:27.301 --> 27:30.103
My expense reports tipped you
off, that's how you figured out

27:30.104 --> 27:32.138
where I was hiding Marva.
God, it had to be you.

27:32.139 --> 27:33.979
Why would I steal "Redemption Ridge?"

27:33.980 --> 27:35.033
Was that your plan?

27:35.034 --> 27:37.035
To distract me
with doing the right things

27:37.036 --> 27:39.204
so that I would blow up
my relationship with Steve

27:39.205 --> 27:41.039
so that you can make an offer?

27:41.040 --> 27:44.342
I wanted that project
for Rainer, you ass.

27:44.343 --> 27:48.113
Just one good movie,
so that he doesn't leave me.

27:48.114 --> 27:49.447
Wait, wait, wait,
you wanted this for Rainer?

27:49.448 --> 27:51.383
- Yes.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

27:51.384 --> 27:53.385
I would've helped you steal it.

27:53.386 --> 27:55.220
Ah, you make me crazy sometimes.

27:55.221 --> 27:57.389
Look, I meant what I said.

27:57.390 --> 28:00.125
I really do want the best for you.

28:00.126 --> 28:03.193
Why is this happening to me?

28:05.364 --> 28:07.097
I was so close.

28:18.377 --> 28:20.277
What the..

28:21.480 --> 28:23.281
Cassie?

28:23.282 --> 28:25.115
Hello?

28:43.069 --> 28:44.502
Jake?

28:54.447 --> 28:56.180
Jake?

29:28.080 --> 29:30.482
Okay, what if I don't show up
for the deposition, huh?

29:30.483 --> 29:32.350
Arrest me? You're my lawyer, dammit!

29:32.351 --> 29:33.451
Find me the law that says

29:33.452 --> 29:36.254
I don't have to deal
with any of this shit!

29:36.255 --> 29:39.257
Ah! Ah!

29:47.500 --> 29:49.367
'Jordan?'

29:51.170 --> 29:53.271
'It's Tange.'

29:53.272 --> 29:54.504
'Are you okay?'

29:56.041 --> 29:58.143
'What you said in the lobby..'

29:58.144 --> 30:00.544
'Jordan, can you please
just let me in?'

30:16.228 --> 30:18.595
You're not seriously
going to jail, are you?

30:20.232 --> 30:23.133
They say I could be charged
with second-degree murder.

30:31.177 --> 30:34.244
Okay. I'm gonna clean you up, okay?

30:37.216 --> 30:40.084
I hope I don't leave my card
in Salt Lake City.

30:40.085 --> 30:42.120
I had it last at
the airport ticket counter and..

30:42.121 --> 30:43.555
Ooh, ooh. Oh, thank God.

30:43.556 --> 30:46.090
No, this one's on me.

30:46.091 --> 30:47.225
Thanks.

30:47.226 --> 30:50.328
So, hey, did the cops find this guy?

30:50.329 --> 30:53.264
No. That's why I'm not
sleeping there tonight.

30:53.265 --> 30:57.101
I, I.. I could not, even if I tried.

30:57.102 --> 30:58.469
Well, how do you think the guy got in?

30:58.470 --> 31:01.934
I don't know, I mean, they were
still looking for fingerprints

31:01.935 --> 31:04.871
when I left, and there's
no sign of forced entry.

31:04.872 --> 31:08.875
Oh, and there was like
some type of power outage

31:08.876 --> 31:11.678
or something in the whole system.

31:11.679 --> 31:13.646
Completely rebooted while I was gone.

31:13.647 --> 31:15.682
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

31:15.683 --> 31:17.617
You know, you should eat something.

31:17.618 --> 31:19.619
I'll hook you up
with an order of sliders.

31:19.620 --> 31:21.521
Mm. Can you make it two?

31:21.522 --> 31:23.523
I'm stress-eating, please.

31:23.524 --> 31:24.657
- 'You got it.'
- Oh.

31:24.658 --> 31:25.725
Want me to call someone for you?

31:25.726 --> 31:27.927
- Cassie? Jake?
- 'No.'

31:27.928 --> 31:30.797
Cassie's so stressed
cramming for final

31:30.798 --> 31:34.633
and, um... Jake's busy.

31:37.971 --> 31:40.973
If you went all the way to Utah
and back in one day for him

31:40.974 --> 31:43.710
and he's busy, he's a jerk.

31:43.711 --> 31:46.979
It's all his fault
and he doesn't deserve you.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.682
'Excuse me? What's the lady having?'

31:49.683 --> 31:50.850
Uh, Pinot Noir.

31:50.851 --> 31:52.552
I hope it's from Oregon.

31:52.553 --> 31:53.953
All the best reds come from Oregon.

31:56.757 --> 31:58.825
Oh, my God. E-Eddie.

31:58.826 --> 32:00.727
What, I, what are you..

32:00.728 --> 32:02.595
- I haven't seen you since..
- Broke up.

32:02.596 --> 32:04.797
- In high school.
- Can I join you?

32:04.798 --> 32:06.798
Uh, yeah, of course.

32:10.871 --> 32:12.939
I think you're gonna need stitches.

32:12.940 --> 32:15.608
I can't even feel it.

32:15.609 --> 32:17.910
How don't you feel it?
It's still bleeding.

32:17.911 --> 32:19.978
Tangey, just go.

32:20.914 --> 32:22.814
You shouldn't be around me, I..

32:23.851 --> 32:26.753
I make the wrong choices.
I-I ruin things.

32:26.754 --> 32:28.887
Anybody in my life gets screwed over.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.894
Jordan, I don't care
about any of that.

32:34.895 --> 32:36.595
Okay?

32:37.931 --> 32:40.999
I'm here for you. Period.

32:46.607 --> 32:47.840
'Hey, it's Harper.'

32:47.841 --> 32:50.576
'Give me a shout or shoot me a text.'

32:50.577 --> 32:52.911
Hey, I keep calling but..

32:54.581 --> 32:56.815
I-I kinda need to talk.

32:58.786 --> 33:02.488
I mean, I guess
I could go to a meeting or..

33:02.489 --> 33:05.724
Okay, please just, just
call me when you can, please.

33:49.545 --> 33:52.762
So, wait, but it, but you're still
all sporty and stuff, right?

33:52.951 --> 33:54.848
Yeah, well, I guess.

33:54.849 --> 33:56.683
And I'm out here
to meet with the Kings

33:56.684 --> 33:58.485
so, I guess you can say that
sporty and stuff.

33:58.486 --> 34:00.420
Good for you.

34:00.421 --> 34:02.789
Oh, my goodness. Wait,
so, have you graduated yet, or?

34:02.790 --> 34:04.391
Are you, uh, are you hungry, pal?

34:04.392 --> 34:05.425
- 'Can I get you something?'
- Oh, no, no.

34:05.426 --> 34:06.426
No, no. I'm okay.

34:06.427 --> 34:07.794
Yeah, we're good. Thanks, Shane.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.496
'Have a glass of wine? It's on me.'

34:09.496 --> 34:11.364
Actually, I'm gonna
switch to club soda.

34:11.364 --> 34:12.532
Gotta be sharp for tomorrow.

34:12.533 --> 34:14.367
I'm on the ice at, uh, 9 a.m.

34:14.368 --> 34:16.469
I don't have to be sharp
in the morning.

34:16.469 --> 34:19.572
So, I'll definitely have
another glass of wine. Sorry.

34:19.574 --> 34:21.440
I always talk with my mouth full.

34:21.442 --> 34:24.444
Classic. Classic.

34:24.445 --> 34:25.612
Okay.

34:25.612 --> 34:29.416
So.. But you do have
another semester left.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.585
This is the LA freaking Kings. Right?

34:31.585 --> 34:32.819
I mean, if everything goes right

34:32.820 --> 34:34.454
I'll be training in a few weeks

34:34.455 --> 34:35.554
and then I'll just
finish my degree next year

34:35.556 --> 34:36.556
in the off season.

34:36.556 --> 34:38.725
Can you just try
not to finish my fries?

34:38.726 --> 34:41.460
- Don't you..
- I can't promise anything..

35:19.667 --> 35:21.468
I'm fine.

35:21.469 --> 35:22.569
You're bleeding through the towel.

35:22.570 --> 35:23.737
It's fine.

35:23.738 --> 35:26.373
J, I'm not a real nurse, okay?

35:26.374 --> 35:27.641
Would you just shut up

35:27.642 --> 35:29.708
and please come see a real nurse?

35:46.394 --> 35:47.627
I can't wait to see your movie.

35:47.628 --> 35:51.364
Well, tssh, don't buy
your popcorn just yet

35:51.365 --> 35:54.401
'cause right now, I'm only
famous for being famous.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.603
- So..
- Hey, I'm serious.

35:58.706 --> 36:01.775
I know a lot of people thought
this Hollywood thing was crazy

36:01.776 --> 36:04.310
out of left field for math girl

36:04.311 --> 36:06.479
but, uh, you're always so comfortable

36:06.480 --> 36:07.747
in front of the camera.

36:07.748 --> 36:11.518
Always so..

36:11.519 --> 36:13.418
...captivating.

36:15.356 --> 36:16.755
Thank you.

36:20.561 --> 36:22.328
What happened to us?

36:22.329 --> 36:23.797
What happened?

36:23.798 --> 36:26.865
College happened.
You went to the East Coast.

36:27.802 --> 36:30.336
I always wondered
what would've happened

36:30.337 --> 36:32.571
if we tried the long-distance thing.

36:34.442 --> 36:37.811
Well, my life would be
a lot less complicated

36:37.812 --> 36:41.514
if you and I..

36:41.515 --> 36:43.683
...kept on dating.

36:43.684 --> 36:45.485
I always wanted to, I just thought

36:45.486 --> 36:48.655
that you did not.

36:48.656 --> 36:50.790
No, I, I would have.

36:50.791 --> 36:54.427
I always felt so easy

36:54.428 --> 36:56.529
being with you.

36:56.530 --> 36:58.430
Still is.

37:01.736 --> 37:03.802
Uh, I'll take the couch again.

37:05.639 --> 37:08.540
No, you should take the bed.

37:10.611 --> 37:13.446
Honestly, it doesn't really matter.

37:13.447 --> 37:15.714
Jake, come on.

37:16.784 --> 37:19.452
You're a good guy.

37:19.453 --> 37:20.520
Paige knows what she's got.

37:20.521 --> 37:22.855
She's not gonna hold this against you.

37:26.727 --> 37:29.395
We can stay up and talk..

37:29.396 --> 37:30.863
...if that's what you need.

37:45.546 --> 37:48.381
I spent the whole night
shaking hands with people

37:48.382 --> 37:49.549
whose names I don't even remember

37:49.550 --> 37:52.418
because I was thinking about Paige.

37:52.419 --> 37:54.788
I blew at least
half a dozen connections

37:54.789 --> 37:57.724
and she's not even here.

37:57.725 --> 38:01.427
Well, thankfully,
I took great mental notes.

38:01.428 --> 38:03.696
When we get back to LA, we can
talk about finishing the film.

38:03.697 --> 38:05.465
And mostly, everyone said that

38:05.466 --> 38:07.532
they'd be open to take a look
when we're done.

38:08.736 --> 38:12.404
I just don't know how
I've come so far and still..

38:14.575 --> 38:16.609
...nowhere.

38:16.610 --> 38:18.578
You're smart enough
to know that nobody gets it all

38:18.579 --> 38:20.646
on the first try.

38:22.383 --> 38:25.752
Stop with this self-imposed pressure.

38:25.753 --> 38:27.487
Why are you so hard on yourself?

38:27.488 --> 38:29.788
I bailed on school for an internship..

38:31.458 --> 38:33.693
...with Richard Linklater.

38:33.694 --> 38:37.497
Then I decided
to make "Stealing Georgia"

38:37.498 --> 38:39.731
instead of going back.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.638
My dad hasn't spoken to me since.

38:48.442 --> 38:51.510
Oh, Jake, I'm so sorry.

38:53.814 --> 38:57.549
He said I was making
the biggest mistake of my life.

39:03.424 --> 39:06.326
I don't want him to be right.

39:06.327 --> 39:08.728
I don't wanna end up at Salt and Sons

39:08.729 --> 39:12.464
selling snow tires
in Michigan for a living.

39:14.535 --> 39:17.437
Send him the photo.

39:17.438 --> 39:18.671
Right now.

39:18.672 --> 39:21.407
Of your name up in lights.

39:21.408 --> 39:23.742
Show him he's got
something to be proud of.

39:28.749 --> 39:30.816
That's a good photo of you.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.785
Yeah?

39:34.655 --> 39:37.389
The photographer's pretty awesome.

39:44.765 --> 39:48.434
You know, I'm so exhausted. I..

39:48.435 --> 39:50.370
I think the altitude's getting to me.

39:50.371 --> 39:51.504
Yeah, it was a crazy day.

39:52.773 --> 39:55.375
Well, goodnight.

39:55.376 --> 39:56.542
'Goodnight.'

40:09.556 --> 40:12.392
I needed to laugh like this.

40:12.393 --> 40:13.826
- Oh.
- Ohh.

40:13.827 --> 40:15.461
Looks like they're kicking us out.

40:15.462 --> 40:16.828
I think so.

40:17.831 --> 40:20.633
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no. I got this.

40:20.634 --> 40:22.901
Thanks. Tonight was great.

40:25.472 --> 40:28.408
Ah, here, let me get it for you.

40:28.409 --> 40:29.641
Oh.

40:41.522 --> 40:45.725
Can I, uh, walk you home?

41:02.509 --> 41:04.644
Are you sure about this?

41:04.645 --> 41:07.612
Don't you wanna find out
what would've happened?
