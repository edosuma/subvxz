[line ringing]

00:45.612 --> 00:47.280
Ah.

00:47.347 --> 00:49.115
I need your help.

01:21.047 --> 01:24.184
[indistinct chatter]

01:30.090 --> 01:32.592
What's the matter with you? You're gonna hurt someone.

01:34.494 --> 01:37.530
Here, come with me. Hey, I got a surprise for you.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.203
This is our mascot, the magpie.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.371
It's one of the world's smartest animals.

01:45.438 --> 01:49.275
Do you know, it can make tools, even copy people.

01:49.342 --> 01:53.546
So if you see one today, you make sure you're extra nice,

01:53.613 --> 01:56.783
because they'll remember how you treated them for years.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.385
[Ron clears throat]

01:59.452 --> 02:01.454
Be right with you, Mr. Brant.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.993
You're Ronald Brant. CEO of--

02:07.060 --> 02:11.364
I know who I am. I need my room. And you need to watch your kid.

02:11.431 --> 02:16.236
-Sir, have a wonderful stay. -Thank you.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.773
I see we have the pleasure of your company for three nights.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.843
-Will anyone be joining you? -My wife.

02:25.044 --> 02:26.279
Thank you.

02:27.213 --> 02:28.982
Darling.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.084
Welcome back, Ms. Novak.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.453
-Or is it Brant now? -Hm.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.157
We met at a gala I hosted here last spring.

02:37.223 --> 02:40.693
That's why Ron's buying the place. He's a sentimentalist.

02:40.760 --> 02:44.330
I wasn't aware we were joining the Brant Hotel family.

02:44.397 --> 02:47.600
Well, it's not public yet, but I like it here.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.537
Plenty of history. Impressive roster clientele.

02:50.603 --> 02:53.373
Mm-hmm. Celebrities, CEOs, senators.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.441
It's fortunate walls can't talk, hm?

02:55.508 --> 02:58.011
-[Valeria chuckles] -Congratulations to you both.

02:58.077 --> 03:01.948
Congrats to you. The Brant name will bring in new business.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.184
Oh. There's another reservation.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.652
I'll take the key for that as well.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.587
Ah, yes, I saw you have two rooms.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.622
I'm happy to hold on to that key until your guest arrives.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.524
No, just give me the key.

03:13.159 --> 03:14.561
State law requires that we keep

03:14.627 --> 03:16.763
an accurate record of all guests check-ins.

03:16.829 --> 03:20.800
-A technicality. -I do apologize, Mr. Brant.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.736
But there will be a beautiful bottle of champagne

03:23.803 --> 03:25.705
waiting for you in your room, and I can guarantee

03:25.772 --> 03:30.109
that your guest will receive the same upon arrival.

03:30.176 --> 03:31.911
Wouldn't want that ice to melt.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.714
Come on, your son's a big boy.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.417
Let's enjoy that champagne. Come on.

03:37.483 --> 03:38.685
[elevator bell dings]

03:40.453 --> 03:42.855
[man on radio] We have a situation in 206.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.757
On my way.

03:48.494 --> 03:51.564
I do not get paid enough to handle puke!

03:52.432 --> 03:55.001
-[scoffs] -Jennifer?

03:58.371 --> 04:01.507
[instrumental music]

04:10.783 --> 04:12.051
[door opens]

04:13.853 --> 04:16.923
Jen should be doing that. It's below your new pay grade.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.691
Hm.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.060
She freaked when she saw the mess.

04:22.428 --> 04:26.599
Guests in 206 got sick, and she quit.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.168
[scoffs] Gotta stomach a little puke in our line of work.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.638
-Among other things. -Hm. Ah.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.440
Ron Brant checked in with his new wife.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.442
You'll never guess who.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.480
-Who is it? -Valeria Novak.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.515
What, the model who throws all those banquets?

04:42.582 --> 04:45.251
-Uh-huh. Oh, great tipper. -Good tipper?

04:45.318 --> 04:47.387
Don't know what she's doing with Ron. He's 20 years her senior.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.222
Well, yachts make men look younger.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.059
-Ah, right. Botox of the seas. -Hm.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.495
I knew she wasn't throwing those parties for charity.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.196
They're millionaire meet-and-greets.

04:57.263 --> 04:59.599
Oh, he's buying the hotel for her.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.901
Oh, he'll probably want upgrades.

05:01.968 --> 05:06.205
Crystal chandeliers, gold-plated toilets.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.707
[scoffs] Speaking of toilets,

05:07.774 --> 05:10.143
you remember the one giving us trouble in 310?

05:10.209 --> 05:12.679
-Rust, right? -Not rust.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.649
-Oh, no, come... No. -Mm-hmm.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.819
Some fool took a dump in the tank.

05:19.886 --> 05:23.189
Upper decker. Made the water brown with every flush.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.325
[laughing]

05:25.391 --> 05:26.959
It must be nice being in management,

05:27.026 --> 05:29.295
not having to deal with all that mess anymore.

05:29.362 --> 05:34.100
Mn-mn. Same crap, different shovel.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.103
[crows crowing]

05:43.276 --> 05:44.877
She's down there, George.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.814
Looks like it's been a while.

05:48.548 --> 05:49.916
Who called it in?

05:49.982 --> 05:53.152
Local guy out for his morning walk.

05:53.219 --> 05:57.557
Says his dog caught a scent. He thought it was a skunk.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.594
The Magnate's not far from here.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.665
Twenty... Twenty-five miles?

06:08.935 --> 06:09.969
Mm....

06:10.036 --> 06:11.170
[coughs]

06:12.605 --> 06:14.574
It looks like she was dumped here.

06:25.918 --> 06:27.920
She was strangled somewhere else.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.830
[camera clicking]

06:42.168 --> 06:43.636
[bell dings]

06:43.703 --> 06:46.139
-[camera clicking] -[bell dinging]

06:47.306 --> 06:50.476
-Ah. -Welcome to The Magnate.

06:50.543 --> 06:53.980
Ah, reservation's under Ron Brant.

06:54.046 --> 06:57.950
[Zakiya] Yes, I see it here. And your name?

06:58.017 --> 07:02.388
I'd like the name on the room to be first name Cash.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.957
-Last name Money. -[laughs]

07:05.024 --> 07:07.760
-Cash Money? -That's me.

07:07.827 --> 07:11.564
-[keyboard keys clacking] -And may I see your ID?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.067
Yeah.

07:18.404 --> 07:19.772
Thank you.

07:21.374 --> 07:25.445
Thank you, Mr. Brant. I mean, thank you, Mr. Money.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.247
-And Mrs.-- -Ah, she's my guest.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.583
We don't need to put her on the reservation.

07:30.650 --> 07:33.019
-Ah. -I'll still need to see an ID.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.860
Thank you.

07:40.927 --> 07:44.664
You have a birthday coming up soon. Turning 19.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.632
We're celebrating early.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.236
-You're all set. -Ah.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.938
Let me hold on to those.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.512
[Astor] Send up my bags?

08:03.115 --> 08:05.618
Hm. Found her contract.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.687
Two weeks' notice. Required.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.088
You really wanna start a law suit

08:09.155 --> 08:11.958
with this place being bought? Um...

08:12.024 --> 08:15.261
Ron Brant's in the presidential suite. His new wife let it slip.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.931
Ah, um, have the floor managers pick up the slack.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.133
And I'm gonna need you on the concierge desk in the morning.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.270
-Nancy's kid is sick. -I just worked a double.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.372
Well, uh, room 305 is vacant.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.808
-You stay there tonight. -I need to go home first.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.110
[Steve] Why? Who do you have to check in on?

08:33.045 --> 08:34.547
-I need fresh clothes. -Uh-uh.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.649
You keep your spare suit in your locker.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.818
Dry-cleaning's on me.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.687
And room service, within reason.

08:43.022 --> 08:46.158

10:00.666 --> 10:02.868
-[door opens] -Feeling thirsty?

10:02.935 --> 10:06.072
Um, I noticed you needed ice.

10:06.138 --> 10:08.474
Really? 'Cause it looks like you're off-duty.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.776
I promised your father it would arrive cold.

10:10.843 --> 10:14.046
Can't upset the boss. Or his son.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.583
Enjoy your champagne.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.786
[music continues]

10:30.363 --> 10:31.697
[door shuts]

10:32.498 --> 10:35.434
[instrumental music]

11:03.329 --> 11:04.930
[Harry] California!

11:06.132 --> 11:08.034
I thought you'd adjusted to East Coast time.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.971
[chuckles] I just didn't sleep too well.

11:12.038 --> 11:15.274
It's these doubles Steve has you working.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.842
I'll talk to him.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.979
Harry, thank you.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.748
But I think I should wait a year before I start complaining.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.551
-Folks still need to sleep, now. -You don't.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.987
-Mm. -Up at dawn to run.

11:28.054 --> 11:30.022
And I never see you sit down.

11:30.089 --> 11:33.159
The good furniture is for the guest.

11:33.225 --> 11:35.227
I learned that in my Dubai days.

11:35.294 --> 11:39.732
Can't park my behind in the same chair as the crown prince.

11:39.799 --> 11:43.869
Well, you a prince in my book. So sit wherever you like.

11:43.936 --> 11:48.307
No need. My job's easier than yours. It's only one room.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.744
How are our soon-to-be-bosses?

11:51.811 --> 11:53.779
Oh! You heard.

11:53.846 --> 11:57.149
Mm, Mrs. Valeria mentioned her engagement present

11:57.216 --> 11:59.485
while flashing her new ring.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.054
[telephone ringing]

12:06.058 --> 12:08.427
Good morning. The Magnate.

12:08.494 --> 12:09.829
Not a problem. I'll send--

12:12.031 --> 12:15.367
I see. I'll be right up.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.506
[knocking on door]

12:20.573 --> 12:21.674
Yeah, come in.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.442
[door opens]

12:25.778 --> 12:27.246
Put them on the bureau.

12:32.852 --> 12:34.820
[Astor] Dirties are in the corner.

12:44.697 --> 12:47.833
[ominous music]

12:53.305 --> 12:54.840
[door opens]

13:07.186 --> 13:11.056
[Phoenix] Hi. I thought we were going to breakfast.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.858
[Astor] I'm not bringing you out.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.301
Ah, my father is entertaining this evening.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.004
-Hm. -If you'd deliver the food.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.339
We have designated staff for that.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.277
You already know we're here.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.513
And we'd like to keep it under the radar.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.251
Hm?

13:44.056 --> 13:47.193
[intense music]

14:01.774 --> 14:03.242
[keyboard keys clacking]

14:04.643 --> 14:06.245
[mumbles]

14:08.581 --> 14:10.049
Welcome to The Magnate. How may I help you?

14:10.115 --> 14:12.418
Detective George Finn. Rupert PD.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.653
Have you seen this woman recently?

14:17.022 --> 14:19.892
Yeah, a-a month ago.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.260
May I ask what this is about?

14:21.327 --> 14:23.896
Nothing concerning guest safety.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.098
If you know her name, I could look her up in our direc--

14:26.165 --> 14:29.935
Detective. Uh, let's speak in my office.

14:30.002 --> 14:32.137
[Steve] Um, Zakiya, the restaurant called.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.773
An order for the presidential suite.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.008
Hm.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.513
[rattling]

14:42.948 --> 14:44.383
[clears throat]

14:50.956 --> 14:53.025
What's the matter?

14:53.092 --> 14:55.394
Mm, maybe it's nothing.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.632
I've been here a long time.

14:59.698 --> 15:03.068
I can tell the difference between nothing and something.

15:08.007 --> 15:11.110
I think a guest might be abusing his girlfriend.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.246
Did you see him do it?

15:14.313 --> 15:17.650
No. But I, I think I saw bruising.

15:17.716 --> 15:22.388
And he seems off. Very controlling.

15:22.454 --> 15:26.492
If you didn't witness the crime, you gotta keep your head down.

15:26.558 --> 15:29.161
The guests don't get in trouble. We do.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.562
[spoons clinking]

15:30.629 --> 15:32.831
[Ron] Do you think this is a vacation?

15:32.898 --> 15:34.233
[Astor] We are at a resort hotel.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.769
[Ron] It's business. Not pleasure.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.404
Look, you're a married man.

15:38.470 --> 15:41.607
If anybody sees you with that escort...

15:41.674 --> 15:44.076
Hey! Out.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.648
-[snaps fingers] -[Ron] Not you.

15:49.715 --> 15:52.051
[eerie music]

15:53.218 --> 15:56.355
[ominous music]

15:58.057 --> 16:00.025
Are there any rooms?

16:00.092 --> 16:03.095
Like, if I wanted to get my own for the night?

16:03.162 --> 16:05.197
Let me find something. Give me a moment.

16:05.264 --> 16:08.033
[keyboard keys clacking]

16:08.100 --> 16:10.769
Charging items to the card on file?

16:10.836 --> 16:13.572
No, I-I was about to come up.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.775
-So what were you doing, then? -Um...

16:16.842 --> 16:20.713
You were right about that complimentary champagne, miss.

16:20.779 --> 16:23.749
I will send another bottle right up. My apologies.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.618
We'll enjoy it upstairs.

16:46.472 --> 16:49.041
[Astor] Do you think I'm stupid? [Phoenix] Please! I'm sorry.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.809
-I'll be good, I promise. -Do you?

16:50.876 --> 16:53.012
-[indistinct chatter] -[Phoenix] I'll stay here.

16:53.078 --> 16:54.613
[Astor] Do you have any idea who I am?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.415
[indistinct yelling]

16:56.482 --> 16:59.251
Uh, security to 303. We have an armed guest. Mr. Brant?

16:59.318 --> 17:01.086
A maid just burst in. She's calling security--

17:01.153 --> 17:03.288
Mr. Brant.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.791
Put down the gun.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.794
[dramatic music]

17:15.134 --> 17:17.269
[gun clatters]

17:17.336 --> 17:20.172
-Miss, are you okay? -She burst into my room.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.440
He was threatening her with this.

17:21.507 --> 17:24.777
That's mine. It's licensed.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.879
We were just role-playing.

17:26.945 --> 17:30.182
Put Mr. Brant's property down.

17:35.421 --> 17:38.323
Steve, she was screaming. We should call the police.

17:38.390 --> 17:42.961
-No, don't. I'm fine. -We can discuss this outside.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.296
Yeah.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.203
-[door shuts] -[Ron] What's going on?

17:51.270 --> 17:53.272
Uh, just a misunderstanding.

17:53.338 --> 17:57.076
-He was threatening her. -She burst in. The sign was on.

17:57.142 --> 18:00.279
My apologies. I'll handle it.

18:03.348 --> 18:06.452
Come, darling. Let's not add to the scene.

18:10.222 --> 18:11.657
Jesus.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.962
We never violate a do-not-disturb.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.730
Zakiya, you know that.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.866
[Steve] You owe Mr. Brant an apology.

18:29.408 --> 18:32.077
Our job is to serve our guests,

18:32.144 --> 18:35.447
to anticipate their every need.

18:35.514 --> 18:38.484
I consider myself very good at what I do.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.489
We hide affairs.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.190
We clean up people's messes.

18:45.257 --> 18:48.260
But I will not be complicit to sexual abuse!

18:48.327 --> 18:50.929
-[Steve] That's enough-- -I quit!

18:50.996 --> 18:53.699
You'll have my resignation by the end of the day.

18:57.836 --> 19:00.372
[birds chirping]

19:01.473 --> 19:04.610
[instrumental music]

19:11.483 --> 19:12.784
[knocking on door]

19:19.091 --> 19:21.527
Detective George Finn. We met at The Magnate.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.562
I'm here about what happened last night.

19:23.629 --> 19:26.165
Look, I stand by everything I said.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.734
Astor Brant isn't a nice guy.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.702
He uses his father's power and money--

19:30.769 --> 19:34.039
Astor Brant was found dead this morning.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.376
You were one of the last people to have see him alive.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.444
Wait, well, what about the young girl that was with him?

19:39.511 --> 19:42.147
-Mr. Brant was found alone. -No, that's not right.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.683
I, I checked them both in.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.451
He didn't want her on the reservation.

19:46.518 --> 19:50.355
-But she was in that room. -I spoke to your boss.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.157
He says you broke into Mr. Brant's room.

19:52.224 --> 19:53.792
-No, I-I heard-- -You two argued.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.462
You took his gun. Astor was shot.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.064
Do you know the penalty for murder in this state,

19:59.131 --> 20:00.999
Ms. Carter?

20:01.066 --> 20:04.002
[intense music]

20:16.448 --> 20:19.451
[keyboard keys clacking]

20:22.221 --> 20:23.755
[Zakiya] How are those days vacant?

20:23.822 --> 20:26.558
That's when Ron was in the presidential suite.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.597
Where is Ron Brant's reservation?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.268
Hey.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.770
-Hey. -I'm surprised to see you here.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.539
Steve said something about you quitting,

20:40.606 --> 20:42.274
needing me to cover the desk.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.810
-Long story. Where is Steve? -Well...

20:44.876 --> 20:49.915
Emergency off-site. Something to do with the shooting, I'm sure.

20:53.952 --> 20:57.222
Hey, uh, you had the third floor yesterday, right?

20:57.289 --> 20:58.890
Did you see the guests in 303?

20:58.957 --> 21:02.327
The murder room? Oh, no. I didn't even change the towels.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.729
There was always a DND on the door.

21:03.795 --> 21:06.198
Maybe you saw them in the hallway. Um...

21:06.265 --> 21:09.968
White guy, 30s. Young woman. Very young.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.504
Doesn't ring a bell.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.539
You haven't seen a red cell phone, have you?

21:14.606 --> 21:17.209
-Hm? -Ah. Some guest lost phone.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.778
[Alexis] Steve has us tearing the place apart looking for it.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.680
-Everything alright? -I don't know.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.582
Um, I'm gonna catch you later.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.450
[knocking on door]

21:25.517 --> 21:28.720
-Harry! -Zakiya. What's wrong?

21:28.787 --> 21:31.323
I think I'm being framed for murder.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.729
Steve told the police that I went into Astor's room

21:37.796 --> 21:40.565
and took the gun. But he didn't say why.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.869
He lied. He said that Astor was alone in there.

21:43.935 --> 21:45.637
The cops told you that?

21:45.704 --> 21:47.706
A detective came to my place.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.808
I-I explained Ron Brant buying the hotel

21:49.875 --> 21:52.177
and telling Steve to hide the affair.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.445
But he didn't believe me.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.247
Someone must have seen this woman.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.516
Ron Brant knew she was in there.

21:57.582 --> 22:00.619
But there's no record of their stay.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.654
He probably told Steve to delete that, too.

22:02.721 --> 22:06.658
Don't worry. I'll tell the cops I waited on the Brants.

22:06.725 --> 22:09.161
I'll let them know Mr. Brant scolded his son

22:09.227 --> 22:10.829
for cheating on his wife.

22:10.896 --> 22:14.166
I'll make it clear Steve is lying.

22:14.232 --> 22:17.969
No, I can't, I can't ask you to do that, Harry.

22:18.036 --> 22:22.140
You've been here 20 years. You put career in jeopardy.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.843
[laughs] With my experience,

22:24.910 --> 22:28.780
it seems someone might snap me up. No?

22:28.847 --> 22:30.982
[laughs]

22:32.584 --> 22:34.386
You've done too much.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.356
Showed me the ropes,

22:37.422 --> 22:40.459
convinced Alexis to get behind me when I took her promotion.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.194
You give me too much credit.

22:42.260 --> 22:46.298
You're smart. You're a hardworking young lady.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.101
Reminds me of my daughter.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.502
[door opens]

22:50.569 --> 22:53.004
You're not authorized to be here, Zakiya.

22:53.071 --> 22:57.476
Steve, why-why are you telling the police Astor was alone?

22:57.542 --> 22:59.544
You know that she... Hey! Hey!

22:59.611 --> 23:01.580
Hey, there's-here's no reason to be rough, now.

23:01.646 --> 23:04.015
Stay out of this, Harry, if you know what's good for you.

23:04.082 --> 23:05.884
I know what's right.

23:05.951 --> 23:09.654
She quit. She's not authorized to be in the hotel any--

23:09.721 --> 23:11.923
Harry, it's all right.

23:13.525 --> 23:14.726
I'll go.

23:23.135 --> 23:26.972
I didn't do anything wrong. Okay. Okay.

23:30.675 --> 23:32.611
Hey, let go!

23:32.677 --> 23:35.714
Why are you lying to the police, Steve?

23:35.781 --> 23:37.482
I don't know what you mean.

23:37.549 --> 23:41.153
You know there was a woman in Astor's room. She got the gun--

23:41.219 --> 23:44.856
You were the one waving the gun around. I made you return it!

23:44.923 --> 23:46.725
And then I left.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.860
I don't know what you did after.

23:48.927 --> 23:52.964
For your sake, I hope someone does. Don't come back here.

23:53.031 --> 23:54.800
You know she was in there, Steve.

23:54.866 --> 23:57.235
Her blood is all over the towels!

23:58.937 --> 24:00.205
Uh, towels.

24:03.742 --> 24:05.777
[line ringing]

24:05.844 --> 24:09.147
Alexis, um, did the laundry trucks come today?

24:10.148 --> 24:13.084
[dramatic music]

24:22.260 --> 24:23.795
[door opens]

24:26.298 --> 24:27.999
You're sure the laundry trucks didn't come today?

24:28.066 --> 24:29.601
-What are you looking for? -Evidence.

24:29.668 --> 24:32.103
-Of what? -I'd rather not say.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.972
Hey, I'm sneaking you in because you're not allowed

24:34.039 --> 24:37.309
through the front door. At least tell me why.

24:37.375 --> 24:40.078
The police think I was the last person to see Astor alive.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.747
But there was a young girl with him, she was still with him

24:42.814 --> 24:45.050
when I went up to clean the room.

24:45.116 --> 24:47.652
Her blood was on all of the towels.

24:47.719 --> 24:49.754
-And you think she killed him? -I don't know.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.624
But as long as she remains a ghost, I look guilty.

24:52.691 --> 24:55.193
Um, finding one towel is not gonna be easy

24:55.260 --> 24:56.695
with the pounds of dirty linens.

24:56.761 --> 24:58.296
I have to try, Alexis, everything

24:58.363 --> 24:59.731
else about her has been erased.

24:59.798 --> 25:02.634
I'd offer to help, but I need this job. My kids...

25:02.701 --> 25:06.037
It's, it's okay. You've helped enough. Thank you.

25:07.539 --> 25:10.675
[machine whirring]

25:13.645 --> 25:14.880
[clanging]

25:27.492 --> 25:28.827
[gasps]

25:32.097 --> 25:34.733
[sobbing]

25:36.935 --> 25:39.704
Help me! Help me! Ah...

25:42.040 --> 25:44.976
[intense music]

25:47.646 --> 25:50.048
[sobbing]

26:11.169 --> 26:14.105
[music continues]

26:15.707 --> 26:19.344
[gasps] Detective, thank God. There's a man chasing me.

26:19.411 --> 26:24.549
I found the woman. She is in the basement, and she's dead.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.518
Zakiya Carter, you are under arrest

26:26.585 --> 26:28.553
for the murder of Astor Brant.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.255
You have the right to remain silent.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.790
Anything you say or do

26:31.856 --> 26:33.892
will be held against you in a court of law.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.160
You have the right to an attorney.

26:35.226 --> 26:36.661
If you cannot afford an attorney,

26:36.728 --> 26:38.196
one will be provided.

26:53.044 --> 26:55.380
-[door opens] -Did you find her?

26:55.447 --> 26:57.215
Sit down, Ms. Carter.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.717
[door shuts]

27:00.552 --> 27:04.189
We checked the laundry. No body.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.893
Then he must have moved her.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.328
Check the security cameras.

27:10.395 --> 27:11.363
We're waiting on The Magnate

27:11.429 --> 27:12.530
to provide security footage.

27:12.597 --> 27:14.599
You can't... You can't wait.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.901
By the time you get them, they would have erased him.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.638
-Who? -People working for Ron Brant.

27:19.704 --> 27:22.807
You're accusing a billionaire of what? Killing his only son?

27:22.874 --> 27:24.743
The girl in Astor's room...

27:26.311 --> 27:28.847
she must have shot him, probably in self-defense.

27:28.913 --> 27:31.082
And Ron had her killed.

27:31.149 --> 27:34.552
And yet no one has seen this mystery woman.

27:34.619 --> 27:36.021
But I spoke to the hotel porter

27:36.087 --> 27:38.823
and he spotted you outside Astor's room,

27:38.890 --> 27:40.225
barely dressed.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.463
I-I was in my robe. I...

27:48.166 --> 27:51.236
I was refilling the ice in his champagne.

27:53.371 --> 27:57.409
Or... you slept with him

27:57.475 --> 28:00.011
and didn't like the way it went.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.946
Maybe he got rough.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.482
Maybe he only wanted one thing, and you felt disrespected.

28:04.549 --> 28:07.018
I work for a hotel, detective.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.290
Sleeping with the guests isn't part of my job.

28:17.595 --> 28:21.866
Someone opened Astor's door before he was killed.

28:23.068 --> 28:24.402
You have a master key.

28:24.469 --> 28:26.604
So does Steve, and probably Ron.

28:26.671 --> 28:29.274
You're accusing a man who wasn't even at the hotel.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.346
Harry. Harry Belfort.

28:35.413 --> 28:38.883
He's the presidential suite's chief of staff.

28:38.950 --> 28:42.320
He saw Ron Brant. He'll tell you.

28:46.524 --> 28:48.293
I checked you out.

28:48.359 --> 28:51.196
Pulled your file from Child Protective Services.

28:53.531 --> 28:55.467
Mentally-ill dad.

28:55.533 --> 28:59.771
Overwhelmed mom. In and out of the foster system.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.177
That has nothing to do with this.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.714
Ah...

29:09.781 --> 29:13.017
Bad things happen to kids without parents to protect them.

29:14.652 --> 29:17.255
That's all a jury needs to see to convict.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.991
I want a lawyer.

29:20.058 --> 29:22.360
-I'm trying to help you. -Lawyer!

29:25.196 --> 29:27.966
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

29:38.009 --> 29:39.210
[sobbing]

29:39.277 --> 29:40.578
[door opens]

29:47.585 --> 29:50.121
[indistinct radio chatter]

29:52.891 --> 29:54.592
How about some stale coffee?

29:56.261 --> 29:58.229
-Hm. -They're out of sugar.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.267
Hm.

30:03.868 --> 30:07.539
I'm not really an Aviator man, but what do you think, Goose?

30:07.605 --> 30:09.274
I think you should be careful, I don't want your greasy

30:09.340 --> 30:11.910
fingerprints getting on the camera lens.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.444
What?

30:15.513 --> 30:19.384
Ah! I should have known you'd have some inspector gadget shit.

30:19.450 --> 30:21.219
You geek.

30:21.286 --> 30:23.955
Well, not much else to spend my money on.

30:25.123 --> 30:27.826
How'd the interview go?

30:27.892 --> 30:30.228
Well...

30:30.295 --> 30:34.132
She says Astor was killed by some mystery woman,

30:34.199 --> 30:36.067
and then his dad killed her.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.938
She's pinning this on Ron Brant?

30:41.139 --> 30:42.640
The jury will think she's crazy.

30:42.707 --> 30:45.510
She swears her colleague, Harry Belfort,

30:45.577 --> 30:49.414
will vouch for Brant being in the presidential suite.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.317
All it takes is one conspiracy theorist, and, poof,

30:52.383 --> 30:55.553
reasonable doubt, and it's all over.

30:57.589 --> 30:58.890
Hm.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.861
It's cool glasses.

31:02.927 --> 31:04.362
Thanks for the coffee.

31:05.463 --> 31:06.965
[gate shuts]

31:16.641 --> 31:19.444
You made bail. No need to go to county.

31:21.212 --> 31:25.817
That bond was $300,000. I don't... I don't have that.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.585
Someone paid.

31:27.652 --> 31:30.021
You're released until your preliminary hearing.

31:30.989 --> 31:32.290
Come on.

31:38.529 --> 31:39.931
[door unlocks]

31:49.140 --> 31:53.044
So... how you holding up, California?

31:53.111 --> 31:55.647
Harry, how did you know I'm...

31:57.148 --> 31:58.449
You posted my bail?

31:58.516 --> 32:00.251
I couldn't stand the thought of you in jail

32:00.318 --> 32:02.020
over this damn foolishness.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.855
-Mn-mn. -How could you afford that?

32:03.922 --> 32:07.959
The nice thing about working in the hotel business for 40 years

32:08.026 --> 32:10.528
is you end up with quite the 401K.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.697
Harry, that's your retirement. I can't ask you to do that.

32:12.764 --> 32:17.035
Hush. I'll get it back when these charges are dropped.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.904
I called the detectives.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.973
I'm giving a statement tomorrow.

32:24.909 --> 32:26.311
Thank you.

32:27.312 --> 32:30.114
Come on now. Let's get you home.

32:30.181 --> 32:32.617
So you want some Southern fried chicken?

32:32.684 --> 32:34.152
-Are you cooking? -I am cooking?

32:34.218 --> 32:35.954
[Harry] Girl, if I cook, you die.

32:36.020 --> 32:39.023
[instrumental music]

32:40.825 --> 32:42.393
[car window opens]

32:43.695 --> 32:45.296
Heard you made bail.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.033
[Valeria] We should talk.

32:49.100 --> 32:52.136
-I have to get home. -I know you're innocent.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.273
I know all about the girl.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.244
[door shuts]

33:03.481 --> 33:05.416
Can't have our chat live-streamed.

33:06.784 --> 33:11.723
So, as you know, my stepson was a disturbed man.

33:11.789 --> 33:13.224
He shot himself.

33:14.625 --> 33:18.429
The police wouldn't have arrested me for a suicide.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.599
Well, Ron had some friends look into it.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.168
They think the police misread evidence.

33:24.235 --> 33:25.803
[Valeria] And once they review what we've found,

33:25.870 --> 33:28.039
the charges will be dropped.

33:28.106 --> 33:30.608
What about this girl?

33:30.675 --> 33:32.944
Isn't it possible Ron had her killed,

33:33.011 --> 33:34.278
thinking that she shot Astor?

33:34.345 --> 33:36.247
Ron is a grieving father.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.316
He doesn't want everyone knowing that his baby boy

33:38.383 --> 33:39.817
got off choking women.

33:39.884 --> 33:41.219
You're saying Astor killed her?

33:41.285 --> 33:44.489
I'm not saying so much as speculating.

33:44.555 --> 33:46.691
It would explain why he killed himself, wouldn't it?

33:46.758 --> 33:49.093
Her family should be told that she's dead.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.496
In an ideal world, but that would put Ron

33:51.562 --> 33:53.564
in a very difficult position.

33:53.631 --> 33:55.933
He can't have his son labeled a monster.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.202
So this woman is carted out with the dirty laundry

33:58.269 --> 33:59.871
so you can keep the Brant name clean?

33:59.937 --> 34:03.007
Look, I don't like it anymore than you do. I don't.

34:03.074 --> 34:04.909
But that is the world we live in.

34:04.976 --> 34:08.546
Some people are guests, some are staff. The difference?

34:08.613 --> 34:09.814
Money.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.720
That doesn't change the truth.

34:15.787 --> 34:19.390
The truth is the version pushed by the better PR team.

34:19.457 --> 34:23.294
Look, if you insist on bringing this woman to light,

34:23.361 --> 34:25.463
Ron will pay to discredit you.

34:25.530 --> 34:28.866
-It's his business at stake. -And your new hotel.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.503
Mm-hmm.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.672
But I want what's best for everyone.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.675
[instrumental music]

34:42.013 --> 34:43.748
Think of what's best for you.

34:56.861 --> 34:58.529
[car engine starts]

35:08.372 --> 35:10.575
[sniffs] Ah.

35:11.742 --> 35:13.411
[door opens]

35:13.478 --> 35:15.680
-Ah! -[door shuts]

35:15.746 --> 35:18.649
Good morning. Have you checked in?

35:20.184 --> 35:22.620
Detective Denton. Rupert PD.

35:22.687 --> 35:25.256
I am working on the Astor Brant case.

35:25.323 --> 35:28.126
-You wanted to give a statement? -Yes.

35:28.192 --> 35:31.896
I'd like to clear up confusion about who's been in the hotel.

35:31.963 --> 35:35.333
Ron Brant and his wife stayed here two nights ago.

35:35.399 --> 35:38.536
-I waited on them. -It's funny. There's no record.

35:38.603 --> 35:40.471
Well, the Brants could have requested

35:40.538 --> 35:42.473
that their booking be removed.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.909
Steve would have done that for a grieving family

35:44.976 --> 35:46.244
trying to avoid the press.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.946
-And you'd testify to that? -Oh, certainly.

35:49.013 --> 35:52.250
I also saw Ron and Astor here

35:52.316 --> 35:54.085
the night he died.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.587
-They argued. -Hm.

35:58.256 --> 36:00.491
It was clear to me that Ron was unhappy

36:00.558 --> 36:03.494
about his son seeing a lady friend.

36:03.561 --> 36:05.897
And why is that relevant?

36:05.963 --> 36:09.800
Astor was shot. If there was a woman with him--

36:09.867 --> 36:12.403
A woman? Interesting.

36:14.739 --> 36:17.475
I think we should do this at the station.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.277
Nah. Ah.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.547
-[groans] -I have everything I need.

36:23.281 --> 36:25.850
Easy. Easy.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.251
[groans]

36:35.059 --> 36:37.995
[birds chirping]

36:55.112 --> 36:56.414
[sighs]

37:03.287 --> 37:04.755
[knocking on door]

37:06.090 --> 37:07.692
Who is it?

37:07.758 --> 37:10.595
[George] Ms. Carter, it's Detective Finn.

37:13.331 --> 37:16.367
My attorney isn't present. I don't have to speak to you.

37:16.434 --> 37:19.503
Wait, wait. I want to apologize.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.639
We're dropping all the charges, I thought I should

37:21.706 --> 37:25.543
deliver the news face-to-face or face-to-door.

37:27.278 --> 37:28.613
Why the change?

37:29.513 --> 37:31.415
Do you mind if we talk inside?

37:36.053 --> 37:37.521
[exhales sharply]

37:48.232 --> 37:51.669
Gunshot residue was found on Mr. Brant's hands.

37:51.736 --> 37:53.471
I don't know how we missed it the first time.

37:53.537 --> 37:55.740
-You think he shot himself. -Looks like.

37:55.806 --> 37:58.509
His wife said their marriage was on the rocks.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.678
And I re-interviewed your boss.

38:00.745 --> 38:04.081
He now admits that Astor had a female companion with him.

38:04.148 --> 38:07.818
Steve happened to mention why he lied in the first place?

38:07.885 --> 38:10.921
He said that he was trying to protect the hotel.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.391
Astor's guest may have been a call girl.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.725
He didn't want the press finding out.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.627
Especially with the sale coming up.

38:16.694 --> 38:19.063
So that's it. I'm no longer a suspect.

38:19.130 --> 38:24.035
You're cleared of all charges, with the department's apologies.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.606
You know...

38:28.673 --> 38:31.676
[sighs] Steve could be in serious trouble

38:31.742 --> 38:33.477
for withholding information.

38:33.544 --> 38:35.379
Might be time to renegotiate your employment.

38:35.446 --> 38:37.181
I don't work at The Magnate Hotel anymore.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.717
Well, for what it's worth, I'm sure he'd happily forget

38:39.784 --> 38:43.654
that you resigned. Unemployment won't cover quitting.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.924
Guess someone has to pick up the dirty towels. Hm?

38:46.991 --> 38:50.628
Clean up other's messes. That sounds like my job.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.799
[instrumental music]

38:59.337 --> 39:00.971
If you need me for anything.

39:06.310 --> 39:07.812
[door opens]

39:09.880 --> 39:11.015
[door shuts]

39:12.116 --> 39:15.052
[siren wailing]

39:18.222 --> 39:20.291
Oh, come here. Come here.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.126
It's right through here. Yeah.

39:23.728 --> 39:26.864
Steve. Who's hurt? Another guest?

39:26.931 --> 39:29.333
Uh, um...

39:29.400 --> 39:30.801
Harry Belfort had a heart attack.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.670
-What? -He-he was in his 70s.

39:32.737 --> 39:34.572
All the, the stress from the shooting.

39:34.638 --> 39:36.974
I should have made him take the day off.

39:37.041 --> 39:40.678
No. No. I-I just, I just saw him. He...

39:40.745 --> 39:43.781
He doesn't have heart problems. He runs every morning.

39:43.848 --> 39:47.017
Old age. Sneaks up on us.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.955
It's good you're back. Um...

39:51.021 --> 39:55.326
What happened over the past few days... Life's too short, right?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.895
Hey, you're welcome back.

39:57.962 --> 40:01.632
This hotel is a family. We need each other now.

40:04.435 --> 40:05.836
Who found him?

40:07.204 --> 40:08.873
I think it was Alexis.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.778
[Alexis] Well, can't say how long he'd been there.

40:13.844 --> 40:15.646
Did you notice anything unusual?

40:15.713 --> 40:18.816
No. He was slumped over a chair.

40:18.883 --> 40:21.118
-Which chair? -The one next to the desk.

40:21.185 --> 40:23.320
No, Harry was old-school.

40:23.387 --> 40:25.489
The good furniture's for the guests.

40:26.957 --> 40:28.692
That man never sat down on the job.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.127
Well, he was having a heart attack.

40:30.194 --> 40:32.530
Probably fell into it.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.966
At least he got to sit in it once.

40:36.033 --> 40:39.103
What about his clothes? Did... Were they messed up or...

40:39.170 --> 40:41.739
Maybe there was some strange bruising.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.942
What are you getting at? Wait, do you know something?

40:48.179 --> 40:50.014
Um, okay, come with me.

40:54.385 --> 40:55.719
[door shuts]

41:00.991 --> 41:03.928
[dramatic music]

41:06.997 --> 41:09.633
You think people are bugging the hotel rooms?

41:10.434 --> 41:12.670
Talk, girl. Let me help.

41:12.736 --> 41:14.905
I don't want to involve you.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.241
Harry tried. And look, you got young kids.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.743
The more reason to explain why people are dropping dead

41:19.810 --> 41:22.746
here daily. I need to know where I'm working.

41:24.515 --> 41:27.618
Astor Brant killed a young girl he was with that night

41:27.685 --> 41:30.187
and then killed himself.

41:30.254 --> 41:32.690
His father's worried that it's gonna leak to the press

41:32.756 --> 41:35.426
and it's gonna ruin his prestigious brand.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.361
Ron Brant's shutting folks up?

41:37.428 --> 41:39.964
If I stop talking about the girl Astor killed,

41:40.030 --> 41:43.534
he'll admit that his son committed suicide.

41:45.803 --> 41:48.138
And I was gonna do it, too.

41:48.205 --> 41:51.041
But not after what they did to Harry.

41:53.010 --> 41:57.781
That man was the closest thing to family I had.

41:57.848 --> 42:01.952
You know how folks become saints? Martyrdom.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.355
We can't go around carrying other people's crosses.

42:04.421 --> 42:09.326
It's my fault, Alexis. I got Harry killed.

42:10.661 --> 42:13.063
And for what?

42:13.130 --> 42:16.100
There's no proof that girl ever existed.

42:16.166 --> 42:19.236
Yeah, like that red phone Steve has us all looking for.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.641
Oh, my God, the red phone.

42:23.707 --> 42:26.744
-What? -I think that might be hers.

42:28.445 --> 42:31.849
-If I can find it, I can prove-- -I've looked everywhere.

42:31.916 --> 42:33.951
Then there's only one place left.

42:42.159 --> 42:43.127
[beeps]

42:49.266 --> 42:50.301
[door shuts]

42:57.474 --> 42:58.475
[Alexis] Anything?

42:58.542 --> 43:01.011
Uh, no.

43:02.112 --> 43:04.848
It wouldn't be anywhere obvious.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.884
Maybe the cops already have it.

43:06.951 --> 43:08.719
They don't even think she exists.

43:08.786 --> 43:11.922
[water running]

43:12.957 --> 43:13.924
Ah.

43:13.991 --> 43:17.127
[instrumental music]

43:20.064 --> 43:21.231
Oh, yes.

43:23.334 --> 43:24.768
Did you find it?

43:27.004 --> 43:30.007
Um, there wasn't anything in the cabinets.

43:30.074 --> 43:32.943
Oh. Then it can't be in here.

43:33.010 --> 43:35.779
-Yeah. Maybe we should go. -Hm.

43:35.846 --> 43:38.315
[intense music]

43:38.382 --> 43:39.383
Ah!

43:39.450 --> 43:42.386
[ringing in ears]

43:44.555 --> 43:47.691
[ominous music]

43:49.493 --> 43:51.996
[Alexis] I, I don't know. I'm freaking out.

43:52.062 --> 43:55.299
What if someone heard? What if someone comes in?

43:55.366 --> 43:57.067
What am I supposed to do?

43:57.134 --> 43:59.436
You need to get up here now.

43:59.503 --> 44:02.873
That's how you said this morning. Don't lie to me.

44:02.940 --> 44:05.909
What do you want me to do? I'm a maid!

44:05.976 --> 44:09.246
No, I'm not doing that. Who do you think I am?

44:12.516 --> 44:14.518
[groans]

44:14.585 --> 44:17.388
[grunting]

44:17.454 --> 44:20.858
No, wait! We can split it.

44:20.924 --> 44:23.761
-Split what? -The hundred-grand reward.

44:23.827 --> 44:27.931
Even at half, that's more than a year's pay. At least for me.

44:27.998 --> 44:29.633
That's blood money, Alexis.

44:29.700 --> 44:33.037
Well, don't be so high and mighty, you think now because

44:33.103 --> 44:35.105
you're the operations manager, you're better than me?

44:35.172 --> 44:37.374
You don't know who you're dealing with.

44:37.441 --> 44:38.976
Ron Brant is dangerous.

44:39.043 --> 44:42.146
He's a rich jerk who doesn't want his dead son humiliated

44:42.212 --> 44:43.847
by whatever's on this girl's phone!

44:43.914 --> 44:45.315
He had Harry killed!

44:45.382 --> 44:46.650
Harry was too old to run

44:46.717 --> 44:47.685
every morning. That's all.

44:47.751 --> 44:49.486
Don't you think it's suspicious

44:49.553 --> 44:52.056
that Harry dies right after bailing me out of jail?

44:52.122 --> 44:53.157
After going to the cops, telling them

44:53.223 --> 44:55.759
about Ron and Astor's guest?

44:56.760 --> 45:00.030
Zakiya, this is a lot of money.

45:01.031 --> 45:03.000

1:00:41.971 --> 1:00:44.073
You were just supposed to check on Phoenix.

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:46.009
Astor killed Phoenix. He killed Morgan.

1:00:46.075 --> 1:00:47.410
It's not our problem!

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:50.413
[panting]

1:00:52.215 --> 1:00:55.585
Oh, come on. Come on. Damn it!

1:00:55.652 --> 1:00:57.887
We have a code.

1:00:57.954 --> 1:01:00.757
We kill the bad guys. That's Astor.

1:01:00.823 --> 1:01:03.292
Not some old man. And not her.

1:01:04.727 --> 1:01:07.196
We're supposed to protect people like her.

1:01:07.263 --> 1:01:10.266
Yeah, that is one of our rules that we live by.

1:01:10.333 --> 1:01:13.736
But you forgot about the, the other one.

1:01:14.771 --> 1:01:17.240
We always have each other's six.

1:01:19.742 --> 1:01:20.977
[thuds]

1:01:26.482 --> 1:01:28.151
Damn it.

1:01:28.217 --> 1:01:31.154
[dramatic music]

1:01:43.633 --> 1:01:45.034
[panting]

1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:51.841
[grunts]

1:02:16.165 --> 1:02:19.769
Come out. Come out, pretty lady.

1:02:20.770 --> 1:02:22.438
And I'll make it quick.

1:02:24.574 --> 1:02:26.142
[Daniel] You behave.

1:02:32.348 --> 1:02:35.284
[music continues]

1:02:36.753 --> 1:02:38.988
[Daniel] Where are you?

1:02:39.055 --> 1:02:41.724
Come out. Come out.

1:02:41.791 --> 1:02:43.192
[door creaks]

1:02:43.259 --> 1:02:47.063
Don't make this hard for me. I'm looking for you.

1:02:49.298 --> 1:02:51.467
-Don't be too scare... -[rock music on speaker]

1:03:00.343 --> 1:03:03.279
[groaning]

1:03:07.984 --> 1:03:11.120
[grunting]

1:03:20.463 --> 1:03:23.299
George. George?

1:03:25.535 --> 1:03:26.869
[groans]

1:03:30.106 --> 1:03:32.575
That's the man who's been chasing after me.

1:03:35.711 --> 1:03:37.380
We served together.

1:03:38.848 --> 1:03:40.583
Afghanistan.

1:03:42.552 --> 1:03:44.187
The academy here.

1:03:45.721 --> 1:03:47.390
He was gonna kill me.

1:03:48.291 --> 1:03:49.325
I know.

1:03:50.693 --> 1:03:53.229
You had no choice.

1:03:53.296 --> 1:03:56.632
We gotta go. Steve will send more.

1:03:56.699 --> 1:03:58.968
Daniel isn't the only muscle for hire in the area.

1:03:59.035 --> 1:04:01.170
We have to expose them.

1:04:01.237 --> 1:04:03.606
That's the only way he will stop coming after me.

1:04:04.540 --> 1:04:06.309
I, I need my gun.

1:04:06.375 --> 1:04:08.277
No, no, no, no. I'll get it, right?

1:04:08.344 --> 1:04:11.514
-Just tell me where the key is. -Upstairs. Behind the cabinet.

1:04:33.569 --> 1:04:36.505
[instrumental music]

1:04:45.047 --> 1:04:47.149
[intense music]

1:04:55.124 --> 1:04:57.426
-[footsteps approaching] -[Zakiya] All right.

1:04:57.493 --> 1:04:59.695
Where are you going? Wait, it's not safe.

1:04:59.762 --> 1:05:01.430
With you!

1:05:01.497 --> 1:05:03.532
Not safe with you!

1:05:03.599 --> 1:05:06.502
You kept her phone. You haven't put it in evidence.

1:05:06.569 --> 1:05:08.838
No, no, just look, le-let me explain.

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:12.508
No. Was this always the plan, George?

1:05:12.575 --> 1:05:16.812
Right? Take me to bed, make me trust you?

1:05:16.879 --> 1:05:19.248
And have your friend take me out?

1:05:19.315 --> 1:05:22.652
No, no, I-I, look, I-I didn't tell him you were here, I swear.

1:05:22.718 --> 1:05:25.554
I, I thought I could handle him. I tried to stop him.

1:05:25.621 --> 1:05:29.091
But I stopped him. And I'm gonna finish this.

1:05:29.158 --> 1:05:31.460
Zakiya. Zakiya!

1:05:31.527 --> 1:05:34.463
[music continues]

1:05:36.599 --> 1:05:37.633
[bangs]

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:40.336
Oh, thank God you're here.

1:05:40.403 --> 1:05:41.971
We're so understaffed, I'm on the desk.

1:05:42.038 --> 1:05:43.472
-Where's Alexis? -Quit.

1:05:43.539 --> 1:05:45.875
If you did anything to hurt her, I will make sure you--

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:47.443
Whoa, whoa, she took another job.

1:05:47.510 --> 1:05:49.645
Said something about better benefits.

1:05:49.712 --> 1:05:53.516
Her language was more colorful, of course.

1:05:53.582 --> 1:05:56.619
Call her and check. I can't see why you'd care, though.

1:05:56.686 --> 1:06:00.323
-She wanted your job. -Harry cared.

1:06:00.389 --> 1:06:04.260
What? Did he become an inconvenience for you, Steve?

1:06:04.327 --> 1:06:05.895
So you had to help get rid of him?

1:06:05.962 --> 1:06:08.864
What are you talking about?

1:06:08.931 --> 1:06:11.534
Harry's passing was a great loss for us.

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:15.204
Twenty years of loyal service, and so sad for his family.

1:06:15.271 --> 1:06:18.341
Performing for a future audience?

1:06:18.407 --> 1:06:23.145
Oh. You've got to know by now that those cameras are for show.

1:06:23.212 --> 1:06:26.682
Here at The Magnate we pride ourselves on discretion.

1:06:26.749 --> 1:06:29.485
[instrumental music]

1:06:29.552 --> 1:06:33.689
Speaking of, come into my office.

1:06:39.962 --> 1:06:41.864
[electricity crackling]

1:06:41.931 --> 1:06:43.766
[Zakiya] You're lying.

1:06:43.833 --> 1:06:45.668
[Steve] You really think I ran an escort service

1:06:45.735 --> 1:06:47.970
out of the hotel and Harry didn't know?

1:06:48.037 --> 1:06:50.940
-That man saw everything. -Harry wouldn't remain silent.

1:06:51.007 --> 1:06:54.210
Harry knew better than anyone how much a maid earns.

1:06:57.913 --> 1:07:01.550
That's why Jen was with the other guest. The older dad.

1:07:01.617 --> 1:07:03.552
[sighs] You think I'm the mastermind,

1:07:03.619 --> 1:07:05.688
but all I want is to sell my hotel

1:07:05.755 --> 1:07:09.191
and live comfortably in someone else's five-star resort.

1:07:09.258 --> 1:07:11.494
Have people finally cater to me for a change.

1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:13.629
-You tried to frame me. -Just following orders.

1:07:13.696 --> 1:07:15.331
-Whose orders? -Come on, Zakiya.

1:07:15.398 --> 1:07:16.465
You worked for me for six

1:07:16.532 --> 1:07:18.200
months. I'm not a killer.

1:07:18.267 --> 1:07:20.636
Face it, I'm not even a great hotel owner.

1:07:20.703 --> 1:07:22.304
I'm middle management.

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:26.375
[instrumental music]

1:07:30.179 --> 1:07:31.580
Valeria.

1:07:34.817 --> 1:07:37.019
She's running the prostitution ring.

1:07:37.086 --> 1:07:40.189
[Steve] Just give me the dead girl's phone, and I can swing

1:07:40.256 --> 1:07:42.958
a nice, quiet life for you back in California.

1:07:43.025 --> 1:07:45.828
Far away from all of this. Safe.

1:07:45.895 --> 1:07:47.897
Phoenix had pictures of Valeria on her phone.

1:07:47.963 --> 1:07:49.432
That's why she hid it.

1:07:49.498 --> 1:07:51.734
She wanted someone to find it to figure things out.

1:07:51.801 --> 1:07:56.072
-And you did. Congratulations. -Who killed Astor?

1:07:56.138 --> 1:08:00.176
Ah, you put all the pieces together except for that.

1:08:00.242 --> 1:08:02.778
God, he's more charming than I thought.

1:08:04.547 --> 1:08:05.881
G-George?

1:08:05.948 --> 1:08:08.984
Just give me the phone, and I'll try to help.

1:08:09.051 --> 1:08:10.753
Or you can wait for them.

1:08:19.295 --> 1:08:22.865
I downloaded everything and sent it to a friend.

1:08:22.932 --> 1:08:24.700
If anything happens to me, it's emailed

1:08:24.767 --> 1:08:27.303
to a dozen newspapers and the police.

1:08:29.038 --> 1:08:31.207
I'll pass along that message.

1:08:36.779 --> 1:08:38.280
That's mine.

1:08:38.347 --> 1:08:40.382
Did you really kill Astor?

1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:47.490
And you were gonna let me take the fault?

1:08:47.556 --> 1:08:50.025
-Just let me explain. -No!

1:08:50.092 --> 1:08:51.927
I'm done with your lies.

1:08:59.168 --> 1:09:01.704
[dramatic music]

1:09:03.105 --> 1:09:04.607
Wait. Just wait, wait, wait.

1:09:04.673 --> 1:09:06.041
[sobbing]

1:09:06.108 --> 1:09:08.677
-Wait, wait. -Ah. Let me go.

1:09:08.744 --> 1:09:10.179
Ah, see, she's got dozens of guys.

1:09:10.246 --> 1:09:12.214
They'll be watching for your car.

1:09:13.149 --> 1:09:14.817
I-I'm trying to help.

1:09:16.085 --> 1:09:18.320
I'm trying to help.

1:09:18.387 --> 1:09:21.690
Okay? Please, just, just let me explain everything.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:24.460
Here.

1:09:26.962 --> 1:09:29.365
[instrumental music]

1:09:29.431 --> 1:09:30.766
Just take it.

1:09:33.536 --> 1:09:36.705
You try anything, I'll kill you.

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:39.975
My truck's this way. Come on.

1:09:40.042 --> 1:09:42.978
[music continues]

1:09:55.191 --> 1:09:56.892
This is where he dumped her.

1:09:58.294 --> 1:09:59.528
Morgan.

1:10:00.429 --> 1:10:02.298
She's one of the new girls.

1:10:03.465 --> 1:10:05.634
God, she's so young.

1:10:05.701 --> 1:10:07.903
I was supposed to protect her, that was my job,

1:10:07.970 --> 1:10:10.739
keeping women safe doing work they were gonna do anyway.

1:10:12.908 --> 1:10:15.144
I normally just wait in the parking lot.

1:10:15.211 --> 1:10:17.379
They are supposed to call at the first sign of trouble.

1:10:17.446 --> 1:10:21.450
-Morgan didn't? -When she didn't show...

1:10:21.517 --> 1:10:24.086
I just thought she decided one job and done,

1:10:24.153 --> 1:10:25.621
that she got out of dodge.

1:10:25.688 --> 1:10:29.358
Then her body turned up. Did Phoenix call?

1:10:31.060 --> 1:10:32.695
Well, Daniel was on duty.

1:10:32.761 --> 1:10:35.097
So you came because of Valeria.

1:10:35.164 --> 1:10:36.632
When she calls, you answer.

1:10:36.699 --> 1:10:40.936
Astor had... already dumped the body

1:10:41.003 --> 1:10:42.838
down the laundry shoot.

1:10:42.905 --> 1:10:45.474
He thought I was there to take it away.

1:10:45.541 --> 1:10:47.710
When I asked him what happened...

1:10:49.345 --> 1:10:50.980
he smiled.

1:10:52.781 --> 1:10:54.817
And all he said were two words.

1:10:56.885 --> 1:10:57.987
"My bad."

1:10:58.053 --> 1:10:59.588
[crow cawing]

1:11:01.457 --> 1:11:03.759
Those girls are the same age as my daughter.

1:11:05.728 --> 1:11:08.664
I don't know, I wasn't thinking, next thing I knew,

1:11:08.731 --> 1:11:10.266
my gun was in my hand and he was dead.

1:11:10.332 --> 1:11:14.069
I-I don't understand. Why is Valeria covering for you?

1:11:14.136 --> 1:11:15.704
Phoenix liked taking photos.

1:11:17.740 --> 1:11:21.610
That cell had pics of clients, other girls, Valeria.

1:11:23.045 --> 1:11:24.313
I promised her I'd get it back.

1:11:24.380 --> 1:11:26.282
So Harry is killed so you all can

1:11:26.348 --> 1:11:28.784
keep selling girls to rich men.

1:11:30.052 --> 1:11:32.288
I didn't know about Harry.

1:11:32.354 --> 1:11:34.189
I didn't know about you. I...

1:11:34.256 --> 1:11:36.659
I thought if I got her the phone, this could be over.

1:11:37.293 --> 1:11:38.794
But it won't.

1:11:41.096 --> 1:11:44.066
She'll never let me go back to California.

1:11:44.133 --> 1:11:47.703
-Not with everything I know. -I'll turn myself in.

1:11:47.770 --> 1:11:49.371
I'll tell the Feds what I told you, with everything

1:11:49.438 --> 1:11:51.407
out in the open, you'll be safe.

1:11:52.174 --> 1:11:54.209
Safe?

1:11:54.276 --> 1:11:58.080
With all of her access to Ron's money, she will find me.

1:11:58.147 --> 1:12:00.082
Oh, no, she won't do that. That's not her.

1:12:00.149 --> 1:12:01.817
You really believe that?

1:12:07.022 --> 1:12:10.025
You framed me for a murder you committed.

1:12:10.092 --> 1:12:11.460
I'm sorry.

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:16.932
-You wanna make it up to me? -Yes.

1:12:21.503 --> 1:12:23.272
Then help me take down Valeria.

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:26.475
[instrumental music]

1:12:35.517 --> 1:12:37.119
[exhales sharply]

1:12:37.186 --> 1:12:38.721
She won't believe it.

1:12:38.787 --> 1:12:42.391
[Zakiya] I've spent nearly a decade in the hotel business.

1:12:42.458 --> 1:12:44.560
Putting on a smile for everyone.

1:12:47.196 --> 1:12:48.931
I can be very convincing.

1:12:52.101 --> 1:12:54.803
Yeah, you look, um, wow.

1:12:55.738 --> 1:12:57.906
I'm going for high-end escort.

1:12:59.308 --> 1:13:02.077
You know, this is a bad idea. I can't let you do this.

1:13:03.278 --> 1:13:05.581
I won't be doing anything.

1:13:05.647 --> 1:13:07.516
You'll be doing all the talking...

1:13:08.417 --> 1:13:10.185
because you need to convince her

1:13:10.252 --> 1:13:14.523
that I'm so desperate that I'm willing to sell myself.

1:13:15.858 --> 1:13:17.960
You already got her to agree to meet me.

1:13:21.897 --> 1:13:25.667
She does have a huge ego. She will not see this coming.

1:13:26.402 --> 1:13:29.004
Hey, we got this.

1:13:30.506 --> 1:13:31.940
We gotta go.

1:13:35.778 --> 1:13:37.713
Darling, come on. You'll be late.

1:13:37.780 --> 1:13:40.115
[Ron] I don't need a grief counselor.

1:13:40.182 --> 1:13:41.917
Of course you do.

1:13:41.984 --> 1:13:45.087
I can't tell her anything important about Astor.

1:13:45.154 --> 1:13:46.522
It's pointless.

1:13:46.588 --> 1:13:48.157
You don't have to discuss Astor.

1:13:48.223 --> 1:13:50.459
You have to discuss mourning.

1:13:50.526 --> 1:13:53.162
Men don't discuss mourning.

1:13:53.228 --> 1:13:55.597
That's why they die of heart attacks.

1:14:02.004 --> 1:14:06.341
Please? I made this appointment because I care.

1:14:06.408 --> 1:14:10.446
I'll be disappointed if you don't give it a try.

1:14:10.512 --> 1:14:13.515
And maybe, after,

1:14:13.582 --> 1:14:16.018
you might feel a bit more up for things.

1:14:17.085 --> 1:14:18.120
Mm-hmm.

1:14:20.055 --> 1:14:23.826
-I'm up for things. -Ah. After the counseling.

1:14:27.362 --> 1:14:28.997
The driver has the address.

1:14:31.834 --> 1:14:34.102
-Love you. -You, too.

1:14:35.170 --> 1:14:38.106
[ominous music]

1:14:38.974 --> 1:14:40.209
[door opens]

1:14:43.045 --> 1:14:44.012
[door shuts]

1:14:48.617 --> 1:14:50.719
-Please make sure he gets this. -Hm.

1:14:55.557 --> 1:14:57.292
-[knocking on door] -Come in.

1:14:57.359 --> 1:14:58.560
[door opens]

1:14:59.661 --> 1:15:00.963
[door shuts]

1:15:01.697 --> 1:15:04.933
[Valeria gasps] Darling!

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.669
You always bring the best gifts.

1:15:20.616 --> 1:15:22.618
Hiding something?

1:15:23.852 --> 1:15:27.155
Ss... Oh, poor baby.

1:15:27.222 --> 1:15:29.825
Isn't that why you sent him to my house?

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:33.896
I wanted him to talk some sense into you,

1:15:33.962 --> 1:15:36.632
explain what had to be done.

1:15:36.698 --> 1:15:38.600
But he had other ideas.

1:15:38.667 --> 1:15:41.236
[scoffs] Some partner.

1:15:41.303 --> 1:15:45.073
I brought you the phone and a new recruit.

1:16:00.422 --> 1:16:02.357
She's playing you, darling.

1:16:02.424 --> 1:16:03.592
Saying anything and everything

1:16:03.659 --> 1:16:05.994
so you won't do what you have to do.

1:16:06.895 --> 1:16:08.230
You really think I'm that dumb?

1:16:08.297 --> 1:16:11.500
No. I think you have a big heart.

1:16:11.567 --> 1:16:14.303
And in this line of business, that's a weakness.

1:16:14.369 --> 1:16:18.073
She's desperate. Jobless, no family to fall back on.

1:16:18.140 --> 1:16:21.176
This won't be the first time she's traded sex for money.

1:16:23.011 --> 1:16:24.513
[George] She's not smart enough to play us.

1:16:24.580 --> 1:16:27.716
[ominous music]

1:16:32.521 --> 1:16:34.823
Hm...

1:16:34.890 --> 1:16:37.092
That's where you're wrong, George.

1:16:38.026 --> 1:16:40.128
This one is brilliant.

1:16:42.230 --> 1:16:43.699
It's a trap.

1:16:44.499 --> 1:16:46.101
Get rid of her.

1:16:48.570 --> 1:16:50.005
Oh.

1:16:50.072 --> 1:16:51.607
Unless you've fallen for her

1:16:51.673 --> 1:16:53.375
and you're working together.

1:16:55.477 --> 1:16:56.845
-Wait. -Zakiya.

1:16:56.912 --> 1:17:01.116
-You've said enough, George. -Ooh, feisty, too.

1:17:01.183 --> 1:17:05.387
You're right. I don't wanna do this.

1:17:06.855 --> 1:17:09.191
I wanna manage this hotel.

1:17:10.425 --> 1:17:15.364
You told me once we don't live in an ideal world.

1:17:16.498 --> 1:17:18.233
I accept that now.

1:17:19.234 --> 1:17:20.969
I'm done.

1:17:21.036 --> 1:17:24.272
Struggling to pay my rent working for idiots like Steve.

1:17:24.339 --> 1:17:26.808
I'm done playing fair.

1:17:29.277 --> 1:17:30.779
Let me run it.

1:17:32.014 --> 1:17:35.817
You need someone smart handling this hotel.

1:17:36.551 --> 1:17:38.353
Ambitious.

1:17:38.420 --> 1:17:40.622
I like that in a woman.

1:17:40.689 --> 1:17:42.858
Reminds me of myself.

1:17:42.924 --> 1:17:45.160
But I don't need a partner.

1:17:45.227 --> 1:17:46.728
Nor do I need muscle that doesn't know

1:17:46.795 --> 1:17:48.563
how to follow orders.

1:17:48.630 --> 1:17:51.333
Right again.

1:17:51.400 --> 1:17:53.735
You don't need him.

1:17:53.802 --> 1:17:55.704
I don't need him.

1:17:56.772 --> 1:17:59.708
We don't need men at all.

1:18:01.576 --> 1:18:03.178
Did you know

1:18:03.245 --> 1:18:07.883
he told me everything you do, down to the last detail?

1:18:07.949 --> 1:18:09.518
What are you doing?

1:18:09.584 --> 1:18:13.722
You need a smart woman managing this hotel

1:18:13.789 --> 1:18:16.558
so you can focus on your business,

1:18:16.625 --> 1:18:20.796
so you don't lose girls to bad clients like Astor.

1:18:20.862 --> 1:18:24.499
Oh, please. Astor was my ticket to Ron.

1:18:24.566 --> 1:18:27.836
I let him in so Ron could come to my events.

1:18:27.903 --> 1:18:30.639
But he got greedy, said I had to give him girls

1:18:30.706 --> 1:18:31.907
or else he'd tell on me to daddy.

1:18:31.973 --> 1:18:34.042
You knew he was a killer?

1:18:37.379 --> 1:18:39.414
You sacrificed Morgan and Phoenix?

1:18:39.481 --> 1:18:41.950
Oh, don't be so shocked.

1:18:42.017 --> 1:18:44.853
In business, as in war,

1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:47.322
people are expendable.

1:18:47.389 --> 1:18:48.990
Obviously, I didn't intend for Astor

1:18:49.057 --> 1:18:50.992
to keep getting away with it.

1:18:51.059 --> 1:18:53.195
I was always going to get rid of him.

1:18:55.597 --> 1:18:57.766
-[door opens] -Darling?

1:18:57.833 --> 1:18:59.801
[Valeria on tape] I was always going to get rid of him.

1:18:59.868 --> 1:19:03.805
Social-media glasses. Three-hundred bucks.

1:19:04.706 --> 1:19:06.875
Bought 'em with my last bonus.

1:19:06.942 --> 1:19:09.377
You're responsible for my son's death.

1:19:09.444 --> 1:19:12.881
-No, that is not-- -I watched the whole thing.

1:19:12.948 --> 1:19:15.951
Well, he murdered my girls!

1:19:16.017 --> 1:19:17.786
And if everything is not deleted in one second,

1:19:17.853 --> 1:19:19.688
everyone will know that! Everybody!

1:19:19.755 --> 1:19:21.590
I want you out of here, Valeria.

1:19:21.656 --> 1:19:25.327
I'm shutting you down. I run a respectable business.

1:19:25.393 --> 1:19:27.329
You would really throw your reputation under the bus

1:19:27.395 --> 1:19:28.797
for these two? Honey...

1:19:28.864 --> 1:19:31.500
Right now I'm George's only follower.

1:19:31.566 --> 1:19:36.037
But I can quickly add the cops and the local news.

1:19:37.339 --> 1:19:38.507
Honey...

1:19:39.241 --> 1:19:40.475
Oh.

1:19:40.542 --> 1:19:41.510
Wait.

1:19:51.186 --> 1:19:53.889
-[door opens] -I'm an old fool.

1:19:53.955 --> 1:19:55.190
[door shuts]

1:19:57.058 --> 1:20:00.162
Do you know who killed Astor?

1:20:00.228 --> 1:20:03.865
-[Ron] Who she hired? -Uh, sir, it--

1:20:03.932 --> 1:20:07.002
It-it was his partner, Daniel.

1:20:07.068 --> 1:20:08.904
He was also after me.

1:20:09.905 --> 1:20:11.206
He's dead.

1:20:13.775 --> 1:20:16.678
And so are those girls, Mr. Brant.

1:20:16.745 --> 1:20:17.979
I'll see that their families are

1:20:18.046 --> 1:20:20.882
told about their daughters' deaths

1:20:20.949 --> 1:20:24.619
and receive an anonymous sympathy donation

1:20:24.686 --> 1:20:26.888
for their funerals.

1:20:26.955 --> 1:20:29.591
Something substantial.

1:20:30.358 --> 1:20:31.393
Good.

1:20:33.161 --> 1:20:37.599
And you deserve a promotion.

1:20:38.533 --> 1:20:41.603
You're a problem-solver.

1:20:41.670 --> 1:20:45.073
You know, I own hotels, but I don't run them.

1:20:45.140 --> 1:20:48.043
We'll need a general manager.

1:20:48.109 --> 1:20:50.478
That'll be a big salary increase.

1:20:54.516 --> 1:20:58.920
I think I'm done cleaning up rich people's messes.

1:20:58.987 --> 1:21:00.889
Find someone else.

1:21:01.356 --> 1:21:02.424
I quit.

1:21:05.427 --> 1:21:06.461
Me, too.

1:21:08.763 --> 1:21:11.900
[instrumental music]

1:21:15.403 --> 1:21:16.605
So what's next?

1:21:17.939 --> 1:21:19.241
I don't know.

1:21:19.307 --> 1:21:21.877
Ah, you would make a great cop.

1:21:21.943 --> 1:21:23.778
And I could use a new partner.

1:21:23.845 --> 1:21:26.414
I'll consider it.

1:21:26.481 --> 1:21:27.916
First...

1:21:29.985 --> 1:21:32.153
I think we deserve a vacation.

1:21:32.220 --> 1:21:35.357
[music continues]

1:22:04.986 --> 1:22:08.123
[music continues]

1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:41.656
[instrumental music]

1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:14.656

1:23:29.671 --> 1:23:32.607
[eerie music]

1:23:36.177 --> 1:23:39.314

1:24:09.210 --> 1:24:12.347
[music continues]
