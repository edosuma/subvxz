Fashion emergency, Falcon.

00:08.943 --> 00:10.509
Which shirt should
I wear for tomorrow?

00:10.511 --> 00:13.312
Well, that depends, Finch.

to look awesome,

to wear a red shirt?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.387
It's so obvious now!

00:25.226 --> 00:27.993
How is Joey still
the coolest kid in school?

00:27.995 --> 00:31.130
And how has my genius
not been recognized?

Check out the Parker-Pack.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.346
Oh! What is this thing?

00:47.348 --> 00:50.182
This is a jetpack
that I invented.

00:50.184 --> 00:53.252
I just need someone brave
to be the test pilot.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.055
Oh, oh, me, me, me, me!
Me! (clears throat)

00:56.057 --> 01:01.226
I mean, uh...

01:01.228 --> 01:03.162
Once Booms sees my jetpack,

01:03.164 --> 01:07.232
I will finally
soar higher than Falcon.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.936
But if it accidentally
blows up on its maiden flight,

01:10.938 --> 01:13.405
I'd rather have Joey wearing it.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.375
Three, two, one!

Ow, ow, ow, ow! Oh, Parker!
Oh, my ankles! Ow, ow!

01:21.415 --> 01:26.085
(sighs) I failed,
and yet it feels like I won.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.754
How could that be?
Oh, yeah, I know.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.356

-I got fired.
-Oh... I'm so sorry.
What happened?

03:42.523 --> 03:45.757
The producers blamed me

03:45.759 --> 03:48.493
-But that's so not your fault.
-Yeah, that's what I said.

03:48.495 --> 03:51.563
Well, that's what I shouted.

(music playing)

12:36.389 --> 12:40.925
Liv, are you and,
uh, little Liv ready?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.595
Because we need a Sasha bad.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.896
We've seen 20 kids today,

12:44.898 --> 12:47.132
and the network hated
every last one of them.

12:47.134 --> 12:50.401
Child, pay attention
to my words.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.670
You are our last hope.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.443
-I am?
-Yes.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.612
You also have
the eyes of a baby deer.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.113
(chuckles)

13:02.115 --> 13:04.215
Do not let us down,
baby deer!

13:05.986 --> 13:08.953
Gemma, that is a lot
of pressure to put on her.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.623
Oh, there's pressure,
<i>mamacita.</i>

13:11.625 --> 13:14.225
If she doesn't nail it,
this show is over.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.127
And I lose my house
and my dog.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.129
Gemma, you don't
even have a dog.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.999
And I will never get a dog
if this show is cancelled.

13:23.270 --> 13:28.139
Liv, this isn't what I expected.
I'm kind of freaking out here.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.141
Everybody gets
nervous auditioning.

13:30.143 --> 13:35.146
Okay? And I know that you
are going to be amazing.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.316
Please welcome Ruby,

13:38.318 --> 13:40.518
the actress who will
save all of our jobs

13:40.520 --> 13:42.754
and revolutionize
television itself.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.695
I can't do this.
I'm sorry, Liv.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.936
(chuckles) The good news
is those stairs go nowhere,

13:57.938 --> 14:00.004
so we have her cornered.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.207
(music playing)

14:03.810 --> 14:05.543
(music playing)

14:12.052 --> 14:15.119
(chuckles) So...

14:15.121 --> 14:17.856
I completely understand.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.958
This is very overwhelming.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.393
There's a lot
of important people here
to watch you.

14:22.395 --> 14:27.532
I'm not worried about them.
I'm worried about you.

14:27.534 --> 14:31.302
-You're worried about me?
-Yeah.

14:31.304 --> 14:35.540
If I don't do a good job,
your show will be cancelled.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.209
I just don't want
to let you down.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.247
Ruby, no.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.616
You could never let me down.

14:46.987 --> 14:52.223
If you don't wanna audition,
you don't have to audition!

14:52.225 --> 14:54.859
It would be really, really fun
for me to work with you,

14:54.861 --> 14:59.464
but I promise it's fun enough
for me just being your cousin.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.034
Thanks, Liv.

15:03.036 --> 15:07.338
I'm gonna go tell Gemma
that this isn't happening.

15:07.340 --> 15:11.242
Wait. You know what?

15:11.244 --> 15:15.113
Now that I know
I can't disappoint you,
I want to audition.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.350
Are you sure you're not
just doing this for me?

15:19.352 --> 15:23.688
Totally sure.
Let's do this!

15:25.258 --> 15:27.625
-Do what?
-Let's...

Have you been up all night?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.279
Yes, I have.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.581
Because I am attempting
to rewrite

15:50.583 --> 15:52.583
my entire paper from memory.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.486
Because I spilled juice
all over my hard drive.

15:55.488 --> 15:59.924
Ooh. You mixed water
and earth elements.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.125
That is a no-no combo.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.831
Maybe I could work
with Mother Earth
to fix it.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.570
You know what?
Yeah, sure. I am desperate.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.740
So why don't you
do that juju that you do-do.

16:16.977 --> 16:20.178
I will need
an ostrich feather.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.214
Oh, luckily, I have one in my
drawer of holistic healing.

16:26.453 --> 16:31.723
(screeching)

16:33.660 --> 16:36.828
-(screeching)
-(computer chimes)

16:40.166 --> 16:44.268
It-- it-- it's on!
That just turned on!

16:44.270 --> 16:48.272
Last night, the computer turned
itself on after it dried out.

16:48.274 --> 16:52.343
But if it makes her believe
in the juju that I do-do,

16:52.345 --> 16:54.946
then let her believe
that it is true-true.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.981
(music plays)

16:56.983 --> 17:01.285

17:07.727 --> 17:10.328
What's it like
up there, Falcon?

17:10.330 --> 17:12.163
What do the clouds
taste like?

17:12.165 --> 17:14.499
(chuckles) Well, Finchy,

17:14.501 --> 17:17.802
the clouds taste like...
cotton candy.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.905
(cheering)

17:20.907 --> 17:23.474
Scientifically,
I know that's not possible,

17:23.476 --> 17:26.344
but Falcon
makes me want to believe!

17:26.346 --> 17:29.847
Instead of describing
this magical cloud,

17:29.849 --> 17:33.651
why don't you bring
some down here so
that we can all taste it?

17:33.653 --> 17:38.322
(laughs) Well, I'm not
really sure that's possible.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.428
Uh, anything is
possible for Falcon!

17:43.430 --> 17:45.063
-Right, guys?
-All: Yeah!

17:45.065 --> 17:47.432
All: Falcon! Falcon!

17:47.434 --> 17:52.770
-Falcon! Falcon!
-Uh... okay. (laughs)

17:52.772 --> 17:55.640
Okay, I...
I guess this is happening.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.679

18:05.952 --> 18:09.353

18:11.758 --> 18:16.394
I had had enough of Joey
getting credit for my invention.

18:16.396 --> 18:20.765
Luckily, every good scientist
builds an override switch.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.403
Whoa! (shouting)

18:25.405 --> 18:29.240
-Oh! Ah!
-Whoa, what's Falcon doing?

18:29.242 --> 18:33.144
(shouting) Mayday! Mayday!

18:33.146 --> 18:36.280
(shouting)

18:37.617 --> 18:39.417
He's headed
for a flock of seagulls!

18:39.419 --> 18:41.719
Oh, is he?

18:43.556 --> 18:46.324
Oh, no! Ahh!

18:46.326 --> 18:49.894
-Watch out!
-(Joey shouting)

18:49.896 --> 18:52.296
(all gasp)

18:53.733 --> 18:55.833
Falcon, say something.

19:03.076 --> 19:08.079
Who... wants some cloud?

19:08.081 --> 19:11.249
(cheering)

19:11.251 --> 19:15.086
I remembered that I always carry
cotton candy in my pants.

19:15.088 --> 19:19.457
I also carry thumbtacks.
Guess which pocket I fell on.

19:19.459 --> 19:23.194
