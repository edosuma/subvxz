(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.076 --> 00:11.745
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.779 --> 00:14.348
In New York City,
the dedicated Detectives

00:14.382 --> 00:16.350
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.384 --> 00:17.785
are members of
an elite squad

00:17.818 --> 00:19.620
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.190
These are their stories.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.697
(Stabler)
There he is.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.766
The plane's still
on the ground, Captain.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.571
What is this?

00:37.605 --> 00:39.840
Your son taking a little
one-way trip to Rio?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.675
We've had this trip
planned for months.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.112
Douglas Waverly,
you're under arrest.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.546
Why can't you
leave me alone?

00:45.579 --> 00:47.715
If we let them
cancel the prom this year,

00:47.748 --> 00:50.351
you underclassmen
will never get it back.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.453
All right, we have to fight
the morals police.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.122
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.823
Hi. We're the real police.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.158
Jason King,
you're under arrest.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.826
Nick Pratt,
you're under arrest for...

00:58.859 --> 01:00.328
the rape and murder
of Jennifer Durning,

01:00.361 --> 01:02.263
the 17-year-old Canadian
high school student

01:02.296 --> 01:03.597
who disappeared two months ago

01:03.631 --> 01:05.766
while on her senior class
trip here in New York.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.235
This is preposterous!

01:07.268 --> 01:09.103
No one asked you yet,
Mr. Gates.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.404
Bail.

01:10.438 --> 01:11.572
The People
request remand.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.440
And the defense moves

01:12.473 --> 01:14.108
for immediate dismissal
of all charges.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.310
The People can't even
make out the basic elements

01:16.344 --> 01:17.578
of the crime,
Your Honor.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.147
Jennifer Durning has
a history of running away.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.748
Once, when she was 14.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.783
They can't prove she's dead.
They still don't have the body.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.585
(Judge Ridenour)
Is that true, Ms. Novak?

01:24.618 --> 01:25.819
Yes, Your Honor.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.688
Then on what basis were
the defendants arrested?

01:27.721 --> 01:30.691
A tip to the police hotline
saying that Mr. Waverly

01:30.724 --> 01:31.825
was leaving the country.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.228
Detectives arrested him
boarding a chartered plane

01:34.262 --> 01:35.596
to Rio de Janeiro.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.897
Which is not a crime.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.466
And where my client's father
was taking him

01:38.499 --> 01:40.234
on legitimate business
for his produce company.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.669
And from where,

01:41.702 --> 01:43.837
conveniently, we'd never
be able to extradite him.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.639
Do the People
have any evidence

01:45.673 --> 01:47.841
that a rape or murder
took place?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.910
More than enough to guarantee
an indictment.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.246
Care to share that with us,
Counselor?

01:52.280 --> 01:53.814
We have a videotape
of the defendants

01:53.847 --> 01:55.683
serving the victim alcohol
just before she disappeared.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.950
Now, beyond that,

01:56.984 --> 01:59.920
the People are not prepared
to divulge anything further.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.821
They have nothing,
Your Honor.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.756
You can't prove murder
without a dead body.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.692
Or rape without
a live victim.

02:04.725 --> 02:05.893
I'm familiar with

02:05.926 --> 02:07.761
the rules of evidence,
Mr. Seaver.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.898
On the charge
of endangering

02:10.931 --> 02:12.065
the welfare of a minor,

02:12.099 --> 02:13.867
the defendants are released
on their own recognizance.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.836
Your Honor, move that the court
seize the passports

02:15.869 --> 02:16.870
of all three defendants.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.672
So ordered.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.474
However, until the People
secure indictments,

02:20.508 --> 02:22.776
I have no choice but to grant
the defense motion.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.813
The charges of rape and murder
are dismissed.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.848
[gavel pounds]

03:17.931 --> 03:19.433
We had to arrest
all three of them.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.534
You made the right call.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.969
I swung for the fences
and struck out.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.971
It was a ballsy move.
You bought us time.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.339
Yeah, until
the D.A. finds out

03:25.373 --> 03:26.640
and filets me
like a catfish.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.642
Unless we can find
Jennifer's body before then.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.010
Well, not likely.
She could be anywhere.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.246
Okay, then, take me
through it one more time.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.249
Just so I'm sure
I haven't missed anything.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.851
Okay, we know Jennifer
went to the dance club

03:37.885 --> 03:38.919
with her friends.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.355
She left the dance club
at 11:30

03:41.389 --> 03:44.492
with Nick, Doug, and Jason.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.595
She came back to her hotel room
right before 1:00 a.m.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.263
Okay, so she goes up
to her room.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.063
She gets
the mystery phone call.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.665
And then she
leaves again at 1:14.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.866
Right, for the last time.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.568
After that, there's no
sign of any of them,

03:54.602 --> 03:56.304
until Nick and Doug
turn up at the Bayside Diner

03:56.337 --> 03:58.272
and call the precinct
about their car

03:58.306 --> 03:59.907
at 3:19 a.m.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.609
You know, Jennifer's
hotel is in Midtown.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.311
Middle of the night,
no traffic.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.879
Bayside Diner's a 15-minute
trip from there.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.281
Gives them more than two hours
to kill Jennifer,

04:07.315 --> 04:08.949
dump her and the car.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.484
Get to the diner,
grab a cup of joe,

04:10.518 --> 04:12.286
report the Chevy stolen.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.954
Maybe it was stolen.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.956
A '71 Chevelle?
At today's gas prices?

04:15.989 --> 04:18.025
(Benson)
Look, we checked
every cab in the city,

04:18.058 --> 04:18.892
including gypsies.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.462
Nobody drove those kids
to that diner.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.830
There's over 1,000 places
in Queens alone.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.398
They could have dumped
Jennifer in the car.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.933
We don't even have
a place to start.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.502
You can start by thinking
about what the hell you're doing

04:28.536 --> 04:29.603
before you do it.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.804
Here we go.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.072
I tried to reach you.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.674
Your secretary said
you were giving a speech.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.075
You guaranteed
an indictment,

04:35.108 --> 04:36.910
on the record,
in open court?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.612
I had no choice.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.047
We're gonna be lucky
if we don't get sued

04:40.080 --> 04:41.382
by those three boys
for false arrest.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.950
We know they did it,
Mr. Branch.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.985
We've got DNA, videotapes,
witnesses.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.086
Without a body

04:46.119 --> 04:48.422
or a confession,
arresting them today

04:48.456 --> 04:50.491
makes us all
look like idiots.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.960
Now, find the girl or
flip one of those kids

04:52.993 --> 04:56.029
before their lawyers find out
what we got on them.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.598
(Stabler)
Flip 'em?

04:57.631 --> 05:00.100
Lawyers start crying every
time we get near 'em.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.570
We have more than
enough for warrants

05:02.603 --> 05:04.004
to swab them for DNA.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.507
Maybe that'll scare one of them
into giving it up.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.409
Have Doc Warner
cook up a reason

05:08.442 --> 05:09.810
to take the samples here.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.946
And make sure those boys
all come in at the same time.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.016
(Seaver)
Well, you're not
the medical examiner.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.786
She'll be here
any second.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.688
From her contamination
cleanup at the morgue?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.089
Right.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.223
Well, maybe while
you're waiting,

05:23.256 --> 05:25.493
your client would like to see
himself on home video.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.995
Jennifer's friend
Danna shot it.

05:28.028 --> 05:28.996
Danna!

05:29.029 --> 05:31.098
I never knew New York
could be so much fun.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.668
This is my new friend
Jason.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.004
We're gonna dance
till we drop,

05:37.037 --> 05:39.507
and then who knows?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.875
Yeah, we came here
for a DNA test,

05:41.909 --> 05:45.446
not so you can assault
my client with videotape.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.114
Jennifer's friend Danna
shot the tape.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.782
She's also gonna
swear she saw

05:48.816 --> 05:50.851
Nick and Doug Waverly
in the club.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.953
Watch this.

05:52.986 --> 05:56.156
We found some very interesting
security camera video.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.058
There's your client
and his friends

05:58.091 --> 06:00.828
leaving the club
with Jennifer.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.796
Our lab enhanced
and edited the tape

06:02.830 --> 06:04.097
so we could see you
all heading right for

06:04.131 --> 06:06.099
your dad's '71 Chevelle.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.601
Sweet ride.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.470
You got pretty good parking
karma there, Nick.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.440
Finding a spot
right across the street.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.408
Lucky for us too.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.176
(Fin)
We got your client
serving Jennifer.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.645
What is that, tequila?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.447
Unless the M.E. shows up

06:19.480 --> 06:20.881
in the next
10 seconds--

06:20.914 --> 06:22.182
Doorman to the club
will testify

06:22.215 --> 06:23.584
he saw you four drinking,

06:23.617 --> 06:26.119
then the four of you
get in and take off.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.154
Let's go, Doug.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.489
Wait a minute.
It gets better.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.191
We know the rape happened
between 11:30

06:31.224 --> 06:32.493
and 12:53 in the morning.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.694
That's when
the security camera

06:33.727 --> 06:35.563
caught Jennifer coming
through the front door

06:35.596 --> 06:37.030
into the hotel.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.600
And check it out.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.668
She walked directly
through the lobby,

06:40.701 --> 06:42.035
got on the elevator,

06:42.069 --> 06:44.137
and went straight to her room
on the tenth floor.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.706
(Benson)
And, look, she's crying.

06:45.739 --> 06:50.444
I wonder what she's
so upset about.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.780
Is there a problem, Jason?
Something bothering you?

06:52.813 --> 06:55.449
This whole charade.
We're done here.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.950
Don't leave without
a party favor.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.087
Call to Room 817.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.689
What is this?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.190
It's a call Jennifer
made from her room

07:03.223 --> 07:04.124
at 1:02 in the morning,

07:04.157 --> 07:07.427
telling her friend
she'd been gang raped.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.464
Captain.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.733
(Cragen)
Sorry, I thought
the room was empty.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.636
(Stabler)
So you remember Danna?

07:15.669 --> 07:18.872
I'm sorry, Counselor,
that's the girl who, uh,

07:18.906 --> 07:20.608
made the videotape of Jason

07:20.641 --> 07:22.710
making out with Jennifer.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.613
She's also the friend
Jennifer called.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.214
And anything Jennifer
said to her is inadmissible.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.816
Didn't the police academy

07:28.849 --> 07:29.883
teach you about hearsay?

07:29.917 --> 07:30.851
Sure they did.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.853
They also taught me
that outcry witnesses

07:32.886 --> 07:34.488
are an exception
to the hearsay rule.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.556
Good show, Detective.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.990
But we're gonna
skip the encore.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.526
Nick.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.061
M.E. tech is here
to swab Nick.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.130
Good, just in time.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.732
You know, Counselor,

07:44.765 --> 07:46.266
while he's setting up,

07:46.299 --> 07:48.836
why don't you take a look at
the other call from that night?

07:48.869 --> 07:51.104
The number belongs
to the payphone down the block

07:51.138 --> 07:52.773
from the hotel.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.007
(Bradshaw)
We've had about
enough of this crap.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.008
[knock on door]

07:55.042 --> 07:57.244
Sorry I'm late.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.146
I'm Dr. Warner.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.750
Don't let me interrupt.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.718
That call came in on the other
line in Jennifer's room

08:04.752 --> 08:06.687
while she was still on the phone
with her friend Danna.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.589
So what?

08:08.622 --> 08:10.157
Jennifer said she called
Danna right back,

08:10.190 --> 08:11.258
but she didn't.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.226
Because the person
on the other line

08:13.260 --> 08:14.294
lured her out of the hotel.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.697
Are you suggesting
that my client called her?

08:16.730 --> 08:17.931
(Benson)
Or one of his friends did.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.767
How's that prove
rape and murder?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.068
It doesn't.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.570
But this will.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.539
(attorney)
A pair of underwear.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.907
They're Jennifer's, Jason.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.676
Which she stripped off
with the rest of her clothes

08:28.709 --> 08:30.811
when she got back
to the hotel room.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.547
And then she took a shower.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.016
What so many victims do
after they've been raped.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.685
To wash you
and your friends off her.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.286
I know what you're
trying to do.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.921
The D.A. will
cut you a deal

08:40.954 --> 08:42.289
if you tell us what
you and your friends did.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.657
Do you understand me?

08:43.691 --> 08:46.894
I'll never say anything
bad about Nicky!

08:47.961 --> 08:50.097
Never.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.332
You know what we found
on those panties, Nicky?

08:52.365 --> 08:55.703
Her blood, and the semen
of three guys.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.873
Her pants also
had semen on them.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.041
Two stains,

09:01.074 --> 09:03.010
two different DNA samples.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.345
Won't take me long to match
this to one of them.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.248
That swab's your one-way
ticket to Sing Sing.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.252
It was Jason's idea.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.687
My cousin got us
into this mess.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.088
Jennifer came on
to Jason at the club.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.190
She said we should all
get out of there, so we left.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.358
So where'd you go?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.760
We drove down
to South Street.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.094
Under the FDR Drive?

09:21.128 --> 09:22.996
Yeah.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.599
Jason did her first.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.367
Then me.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.269
Then Nick.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.771
She wanted all three of us,
I swear.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.939
But Jason got greedy.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.073
What's that mean?

09:33.106 --> 09:35.809
After me and Doug were done,
Jason went another round.

09:35.843 --> 09:38.211
She was screaming.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.246
Jason wanted
to leave her there.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.314
But Nick and I,
we both said no.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.883
So we drove her back
to the hotel

09:42.916 --> 09:43.917
and dropped her off.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.019
Just like that?
Yeah.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.889
But then Jason said,
"We should have killed her."

09:48.922 --> 09:51.091
He got out of the car and ran
down the street to the hotel.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.893
You and Nick
try to stop him?

09:52.926 --> 09:55.763
We didn't want
anything to do with it.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.165
We took off.
Where?

09:58.198 --> 10:00.067
We just...drove
around the city.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.235
Went over
the 59th Street Bridge,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.304
and then headed home
to Muttontown.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.207
How'd you wind up
at the Bayside Diner?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.977
We got...hungry.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.111
It was on the way.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.313
And that's when
the Chevy got stolen?

10:13.346 --> 10:16.684
Some homie probably
ripped it off.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.689
Both boys
said the same thing.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.522
Jason raped Jennifer,

10:22.555 --> 10:24.191
and then he masterminded
her murder.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.292
And you believe them?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.660
They're the only ones
talking.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.196
I can't make Jason
talk to you.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.430
Well, if he doesn't,
he's gonna spend

10:30.463 --> 10:32.365
the rest of his very
long life in prison.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.667
I told him that.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.335
What did he say?

10:35.368 --> 10:36.704
He'd jump off
the Brooklyn Bridge

10:36.737 --> 10:39.106
before he'd rat out
Cousin Nicky.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.674
He's not talking to you?

10:40.708 --> 10:43.310
No...but I'm
telling you, Casey,

10:43.343 --> 10:45.278
this kid is too gentle.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.080
He's too nice
to be a killer.

10:47.114 --> 10:50.450
He's a piano prodigy.
He takes lessons at Juilliard.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.688
Juilliard?

10:54.722 --> 10:56.790
Every Tuesday,
from 3:00 to 4:00.

10:56.824 --> 11:00.260
Your parents drive you
into the city?

11:00.293 --> 11:01.929
I take the train.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.898
To Penn Station.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.000
What train did you catch
last Tuesday?

11:07.034 --> 11:10.270
The 4:31 to Hicksville.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.404
Like always.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.907
How do you get to Penn
from Juilliard?

11:13.941 --> 11:15.809
Subway.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.278
Number One train
from 66th Street?

11:18.311 --> 11:20.180
Yep.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.381
Why?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.318
(woman on tape)
Police hotline.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.154
(young man)
Doug Waverly's going
to Rio tomorrow.

11:27.187 --> 11:31.792
On a private plane.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.261
That call was made
from a pay phone

11:34.294 --> 11:36.730
in the 66th Street
subway station

11:36.764 --> 11:39.466
at 4:07 p.m. on Tuesday.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.768
What did you do, Jason,

11:40.801 --> 11:42.335
cover the phone
with your sweater?

11:42.369 --> 11:45.338
No. No, it wasn't me.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.473
Miss Novak and the police
already know

11:46.506 --> 11:49.910
that Doug Waverly called
your house that same morning.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.145
Doug told you he was leaving.

11:52.179 --> 11:56.049
You were trying to protect
Nicky, weren't you?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.986
Nicky's my cousin.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.121
Nicky and your
so-called friend Doug

12:01.154 --> 12:03.490
blamed the entire thing
on you.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.526
They're trying
to screw you to the wall

12:06.559 --> 12:08.896
to save themselves.

12:08.929 --> 12:12.099
Don't let them.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.875
(Jason)
Nicky said that we had to go
to this club in the city

12:21.909 --> 12:24.912
because I was...

12:24.945 --> 12:26.780
you know, a--a virgin.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.249
And I needed to get laid.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.519
Whose idea was it
to leave?

12:32.552 --> 12:35.022
Jennifer's.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.557
She wanted to go alone
with me to her hotel room.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.526
Did you go to her hotel?

12:43.330 --> 12:46.233
Jason, please
answer the question.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.537
I...I can't.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.105
[crying]

12:52.139 --> 12:54.207
You have been subpoenaed
to testify here today,

12:54.241 --> 12:56.343
and you are under oath.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.545
You will tell the truth,
or you will go to jail.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.481
Please.
Please don't make me.

13:01.514 --> 13:04.484
You told me that Nick Pratt
and Doug Waverly

13:04.517 --> 13:06.920
offered to drive you
and Jennifer to her hotel.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.856
True?

13:08.889 --> 13:09.890
Yes.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.491
But instead,
Nicky drove Downtown

13:11.524 --> 13:12.592
under the FDR, true?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.428
Yes.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.597
Then you and Jennifer had sex
in the back seat of the car.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.566
No, I didn't rape her.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.601
No, she--she said yes.
I swear she did.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.469
I swear.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.873
You tell the jurors
what happened next.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.211
When we were done...

13:33.947 --> 13:35.515
I got out of the car.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.622
And--and Nicky says,

13:42.655 --> 13:46.927
"Now it's our turn."

13:46.960 --> 13:48.661
And he and Doug got in...

13:52.532 --> 13:53.600
and they raped her.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.303
And when they were done?

13:58.605 --> 14:00.640
We dropped her off.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.010
Around the block
from her hotel.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.845
And what did Nicky say?

14:09.316 --> 14:11.484
Jason, please.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.621
Tell the grand jurors
what your cousin Nicky said.

14:16.023 --> 14:19.893
He said that we
should have killed her.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.896
So she couldn't tell anyone
what happened.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.332
Did you try
and stop them?

14:26.699 --> 14:29.937
I said--I told them
they were crazy.

14:29.970 --> 14:34.341
But Nicky and Doug said
they were gonna do it.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.911
So I got out of the car.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.446
Then I left.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.547
Where did you go?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.882
Penn Station.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.419
I took the train home.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.160
Maybe if I had stayed...

14:53.193 --> 14:55.628
Jennifer would
still be alive.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.507
Who died?

15:07.540 --> 15:09.709
DNA results are in.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.645
All three boys' semen
was in Jennifer's underwear.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.949
But the semen on the jeans
only belongs to Nick Pratt

15:15.983 --> 15:17.217
and Doug Waverly.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.418
Which is
consistent with her

15:18.451 --> 15:20.220
fighting them off
when they raped her.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.955
What's the problem?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.590
Crime scene found
a pubic hair

15:23.623 --> 15:25.358
under the toilet seat
in Jennifer's room.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.626
It's from a male,
but...

15:26.659 --> 15:29.462
the DNA doesn't match
any of the three boys.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.698
She was barely
in her room a half an hour.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.301
We're sure no one
was in there with her?

15:34.334 --> 15:37.170
Nobody even got off
the elevator on Jennifer's floor

15:37.204 --> 15:38.238
during that time.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.607
Then I'll
tell the Grand Jury

15:40.640 --> 15:43.676
that we think the bathroom
wasn't cleaned thoroughly.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.679
Let them decide.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.515
No, I wanna
take it all back.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.150
Before the Grand Jury
decides.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.184
Jason,
you can't do that.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.053
Just tell them I lied.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.621
You'll go to jail.

15:54.654 --> 15:55.989
Look, you're not the one

15:56.023 --> 15:57.390
who's getting
picked on at school.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.426
You're not the one who's
getting hang-up calls.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.494
My friends won't even
talk to me.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.296
Is...is there
any place you can go

16:03.330 --> 16:04.697
until things calm down?

16:04.731 --> 16:07.367
Uh...

16:07.400 --> 16:09.402
we have a summer home
in the Hamptons.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.004
Someplace your families
don't know about

16:11.038 --> 16:12.439
would be better.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.008
Remember, we rented
that ski house up in Catskills?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.176
I could call the agency,

16:16.209 --> 16:17.710
see if they
have anything available.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.047
Indictments...
Nick Pratt and Doug Waverly

16:20.080 --> 16:21.514
for Rape One and Murder One.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.749
(Stabler)
Good work.

16:22.782 --> 16:26.453
(Novak)
We couldn't have
done it without you, Jason.

16:26.486 --> 16:30.257
Oh, no.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.358
Oh, my God.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.459
Oh, my God.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.593
Jason, I am sorry.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.196
Please leave me alone.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.199
Jason...you did
the right thing.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.234
You told the truth.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.570
Nicky was like
my brother.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.338
I know.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.573
I know.

16:46.606 --> 16:50.277
I never--never meant
for any of this to happen.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.345
It is not your fault...

16:52.379 --> 16:55.014
that Nick and Doug
murdered Jennifer.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.689
I'm sorry that I didn't...

17:02.722 --> 17:05.158
[sniffles]
I'm sorry.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.226
I'm sorry.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.428
Everything's
gonna be okay.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.407
(Stabler)
We reviewed every videotape
from every security camera

17:20.440 --> 17:22.509
from the Thorpe Palace.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.577
Jennifer Durning left
at 1:11 that morning

17:24.611 --> 17:25.678
and was never seen again.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.580
When did you enter
the case?

17:27.614 --> 17:30.150
8:30 that same morning,
dispatch sent us

17:30.183 --> 17:31.418
on a 911 call

17:31.451 --> 17:33.186
about a missing
rape victim.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.221
Made by whom?

17:34.254 --> 17:35.388
Uh, Danna Simpson,

17:35.422 --> 17:37.257
Jennifer's classmate.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.359
How did Danna know that
Jennifer had been raped?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.394
(Stabler)
Jennifer called Danna
after the rape

17:41.428 --> 17:43.130
to tell her
what had happened.

17:43.163 --> 17:46.499
Uh, Danna called 911
after Jennifer disappeared.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.401
Detective Stabler,
do you know who Jennifer

17:48.435 --> 17:49.369
was last seen with?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.771
The two defendants,
leaving the dance club

17:51.804 --> 17:53.106
at 11:30 that night.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.441
That's a lie.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.742
Any more outbursts,
Mr. Pratt,

17:55.775 --> 17:57.544
and you will be taken
to the lockup.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.247
Please continue,
Detective.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.782
(Stabler)
We also have them leaving
the club with Jennifer

18:02.815 --> 18:04.384
on videotape.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.686
Thank you.
Nothing further.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.788
Did you instruct
the crime scene unit

18:08.821 --> 18:10.857
to dust Jennifer's hotel room
for fingerprints?

18:10.890 --> 18:12.892
There was no evidence--

18:12.925 --> 18:14.694
A simple yes or no,
please, Detective.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.196
No.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.265
'Cause you didn't want
to have to tell this jury

18:18.298 --> 18:19.666
that the two defendants'
fingerprints

18:19.699 --> 18:21.368
were not in the room.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.835
Objection.
Stating facts not in evidence.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.504
(Judge Donnelly)
Sustained.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.774
The jury will disregard
defense counsel's statement.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.476
Be careful,
Mr. Gates.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.445
Were you present when crime
scene unit Detective O'Halloran

18:32.479 --> 18:34.347
found a pubic hair
on the toilet seat

18:34.381 --> 18:35.582
in Jennifer's hotel room?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.350
Yes, I was.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.518
Did that come from
either of the defendants?

18:38.551 --> 18:39.419
No.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.189
Did it come from
Jennifer Durning?
No.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.457
You have no idea
who it came from, do you?

18:44.491 --> 18:45.692
No.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.160
Then how can you
be so sure

18:47.194 --> 18:48.361
that the two defendants
are the ones

18:48.395 --> 18:49.762
that raped
and murdered Jennifer?

18:49.796 --> 18:52.299
The semen in Jennifer's
panties

18:52.332 --> 18:53.866
came from
the two defendants.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.468
That just proves
they had sex with her,

18:55.502 --> 18:56.603
not that they raped her.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.238
Is there a question
in here somewhere?

18:58.271 --> 18:59.439
Detective Stabler,
do you have any idea

18:59.472 --> 19:01.408
the sex of the person

19:01.441 --> 19:03.410
who left that pubic hair
on the toilet?

19:03.443 --> 19:04.577
Objection.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.513
Counsel in chambers, now.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.251
I will not let you two
mislead this jury

19:11.284 --> 19:12.685
with some unsubstantiated
red herring.

19:12.719 --> 19:16.589
Our clients have the right
to present a legitimate defense.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.258
Not until you prove
to me it's legitimate.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.692
In front of the assistant
district attorney?

19:19.726 --> 19:21.861
You can't force us to reveal
our trial strategy.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.563
Well, then, I move
for a motion in limine

19:23.596 --> 19:24.864
to preclude any questions
about the hair.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.267
Which I will grant,
unless you can convince me

19:27.300 --> 19:28.701
you can connect it
to some suspect.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.603
The presence
of another male

19:30.637 --> 19:31.971
in Jennifer Durning's
hotel room

19:32.004 --> 19:34.507
doesn't prove that their
clients didn't rape her.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.509
We'll lay it out
for you, Judge.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.544
But ex-parte only.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.246
Not with Ms. Novak
in the room.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.513
Your Honor,
I strenuously object.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.216
Noted.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.617
But I have to be fair,
Casey.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.654
And this I will say
in front of you.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.658
If I get even a hint
that this hair is a smokescreen,

19:51.691 --> 19:52.859
I am shutting you down.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.628
Are we clear?

19:55.662 --> 19:56.729
There's no way
we missed another suspect.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.764
Well,
the defense must have

19:57.797 --> 19:58.898
convinced Judge Donnelly
that we did.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.367
Because of a stray hair?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.568
It doesn't make those
two guys innocent.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.869
I'm trying a murder case
without a dead body.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.637
A loose end like that
could give the jury

20:04.671 --> 20:05.872
enough reasonable doubt
to acquit.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.408
Casey, we swabbed every one
of Jennifer's male classmates.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.310
And the chaperones
who were on that trip.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.578
Then where did
that hair come from?

20:11.611 --> 20:12.612
That hair could have
been left by

20:12.645 --> 20:15.315
any of the last 100 men
who stayed in that room.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.616
Or some hotel employee

20:16.649 --> 20:19.018
who used his pass key
to stop in and take a leak.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.687
Which we can't see,
because there aren't

20:20.720 --> 20:22.622
any security cameras
in the hallways.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.890
But there were
on the elevators,

20:23.923 --> 20:25.325
and no one got off
on Jennifer's floor

20:25.358 --> 20:26.426
from the time before
she got raped

20:26.459 --> 20:27.460
until after she left.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.528
Okay, so how'd he get in?

20:28.561 --> 20:29.562
Maybe Jennifer let him in,

20:29.596 --> 20:30.830
or he picked the lock.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.699
Have you guys looked at
any of the video

20:32.732 --> 20:34.401
from before Jennifer got back
or after she left?

20:34.434 --> 20:36.636
Skimmed through 'em.
Didn't see her.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.504
Then let's cover
our asses.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.971
We go back to the tapes
and check out

20:39.005 --> 20:40.873
every person who got off
the elevators

20:40.907 --> 20:42.275
on the tenth floor.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.843
From the day Jennifer
arrived in the city

20:43.876 --> 20:47.380
to the morning that we
got to the hotel.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.781
This is the tenth couple

20:48.815 --> 20:50.850
I've seen making out
in the elevator.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.620
I hope they saved some energy
for the honeymoon.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.688
(Stabler)
Yeah, well, I've got
a catfight in car three.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.491
I think the honeymoon
is over for these two.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.026
Wouldn't wanna get
in the middle of that.

21:00.059 --> 21:03.863
Well, get a load
of Luca Brasi.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.798
Couple years,
another 200 pounds,

21:05.832 --> 21:07.033
that's you, Munch.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.702
The back of his coat,
the seam is ripped.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.372
Captain, you better
take a look at this.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.474
What is it?

21:17.644 --> 21:20.680
It looks like he's hiding
something inside his jacket.

21:20.713 --> 21:21.748
(Benson)
He's getting off
at the tenth floor.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.616
(Stabler)
An hour after
Jennifer left

21:23.650 --> 21:24.651
for the last time.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.685
Fast forward.
See if he leaves.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.654
What goes up must come down.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.357
(Cragen)
How did we miss this guy?

21:32.792 --> 21:36.929
And there he is,
20 minutes later.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.898
(Stabler)
This time,
he's carrying a coat.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.667
That's the coat
Jennifer was wearing

21:40.700 --> 21:42.068
when she came back
from being raped.

21:42.101 --> 21:45.037
Which she wasn't wearing
when she left a half hour later.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.774
He took it from her room
after he used the john.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.776
(Munch)
How'd he get Jennifer's key?

21:49.809 --> 21:52.479
You know, Jennifer had
her purse at the dance club.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.881
But when she came back
to the hotel after the rape...

21:54.914 --> 21:57.350
no purse.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.552
Maybe that's what he's
hiding under his jacket.

21:59.586 --> 22:02.722
(Fin)
We'll canvass the neighborhood,
see who knows him.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.593
(Uni Bamford)
Name's Keith Willis,

22:06.626 --> 22:08.661
a.k.a. your friendly
neighborhood drunk.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.062
(Munch)
Right where
any respectable alcoholic

22:10.096 --> 22:11.664
would be at 10:00
in the morning.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.566
Keith Willis!

22:13.600 --> 22:14.867
Durvo.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.102
Durvo?

22:16.135 --> 22:17.604
Must be Bulgarian.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.440
Keith think he's their
Ambassador to Washington.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.975
You know who I am.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.644
Yes, I have orders
to confirm I.D.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.979
[mumbling]

22:31.017 --> 22:34.721
Sir, we need to escort you
to Foggy Bottom immediately.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.857
Can you tell me
where you got these?

22:37.890 --> 22:40.393
From some boys.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.595
Was it...

22:42.629 --> 22:45.565
was it these boys?

22:45.598 --> 22:47.434
Them!

22:47.467 --> 22:49.502
How did you meet
those boys?

22:49.536 --> 22:53.773
They gave me 50 bucks
to make a phone call.

22:53.806 --> 22:54.974
What did they
tell you to say?

22:56.709 --> 22:59.912
I have your passport.

22:59.946 --> 23:03.049
Please come
to the phone booth

23:03.082 --> 23:04.851
down the street,

23:04.884 --> 23:08.054
and I return it to you.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.757
50 bucks.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.024
Then what?

23:12.058 --> 23:17.063
Uh...a girl came.

23:17.096 --> 23:20.733
They made her
get in their car.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.869
This girl?

23:22.902 --> 23:24.771
Yeah. Yeah.

23:24.804 --> 23:28.074
Is Secretary Baker here yet?

23:28.107 --> 23:30.610
What year is it,
Mr. Willis?

23:32.111 --> 23:34.914
1989.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.885
(Stabler)
Jennifer's purse and coat

23:38.918 --> 23:41.020
were in Willis' roach-infested
dump of a home.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.923
Look, Thorpe Palace
gives each guest two keys.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.592
He goes through
Jennifer's purse.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.793
He finds the one
in the envelope

23:46.826 --> 23:47.994
with her room number on it.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.729
Goes looking for
something good to steal.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.798
Uses the toilet,
leaves the hair.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.065
I need him on the stand.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.534
Well, you're
looking for trouble.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.068
He's demented,
probably from years

23:56.102 --> 23:57.837
of alcohol abuse
rotting his brain.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.872
He was the only one
who saw Jennifer

23:59.906 --> 24:02.174
get into that car with
Nick Pratt and Doug Waverly.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.877
His short-term memory has
more holes in it than a sieve.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.813
He's unreliable.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.781
I just spoke to the hotel
security chief.

24:08.815 --> 24:11.618
He showed a private investigator
the tapes two days ago.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.952
Hired by the defense,
no doubt.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.220
Well, it gets better.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.888
The P.I. told him that
he's looking for some drunk

24:15.922 --> 24:17.056
who followed Jennifer
back to the hotel.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.592
Nick and Doug must have
told their lawyers about Willis.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.827
Yeah, then used him
as an alibi.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.028
But they
forgot to mention

24:22.061 --> 24:23.796
he witnessed them
kidnap Jennifer.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.765
What do you want us to do?

24:25.798 --> 24:29.135
Have the M.E. match Willis' DNA
to the hair on that toilet

24:29.168 --> 24:31.571
so we can eliminate him
a suspect.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.972
Willis didn't see Jason?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.974
Doesn't mean Jason
didn't see him.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.877
Find out.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.216
My husband and I
just got back from dinner

24:44.250 --> 24:45.652
an hour ago.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.187
Jason's asleep.
Do you have to wake him?

24:48.220 --> 24:49.822
It's urgent, Mrs. King.

24:50.890 --> 24:54.226
Well, that's his room.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.195
[knock on door]

24:56.228 --> 24:59.966
Jason,
it's Detective Stabler.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.604
Jason?

25:04.637 --> 25:07.206
He's gone.

25:12.311 --> 25:13.980
Did you see Jason
when you got back last night?

25:14.013 --> 25:15.281
His door was closed.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.917
We thought he was asleep,
so we didn't bother him.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.051
And no one
knows you're here?

25:19.085 --> 25:21.053
(Roberta)
No, absolutely not.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.555
My husband hasn't even
been to work

25:22.589 --> 25:23.890
since this whole thing
started.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.057
Well, I know
Jason was upset

25:25.091 --> 25:26.993
about testifying
against his cousin.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.228
Our son didn't run away,
Detective.

25:29.261 --> 25:32.765
Jason finally saw Nick
as the entitled, spoiled brat

25:32.799 --> 25:35.001
the rest of us
always knew he was.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.335
One minute, please.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.204
Munch dumped the phone
in the house,

25:38.237 --> 25:40.072
Jason's cell,
and the parent's cell.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.141
No incoming our outgoing calls
in the last two days.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.210
Well, maybe Jason got tired
of living like a hermit

25:44.243 --> 25:45.645
and he split.

25:45.678 --> 25:46.946
It's 10 miles
to the nearest town.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.648
At night?
In the freezing weather?

25:48.681 --> 25:50.883
He had to walk, 'cause
the parents had the car.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.685
There was another car
here last night.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.053
I found tire imprints.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.656
The larger ones are from
the King's Mercedes.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.257
(Stabler)
Which the parents drove back
from dinner last night.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.126
Over the tracks
of the second car.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.928
Judging from the smaller
wheel base,

26:01.961 --> 26:03.362
I'd say it's a compact.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.598
I'll go back to the lab
to match the imprints

26:05.632 --> 26:07.233
to give you the tire's
make and model.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.234
Roadmaster Excelsior

26:08.267 --> 26:10.369
is used on any one of a couple
dozen compacts.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.038
It doesn't match our boys.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.973
None of their families own
anything smaller

26:14.006 --> 26:15.107
than a C-Class Mercedes.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.109
And there's no sign of a
struggle in or around the house.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.978
Jason must have known
whoever came to get him.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.379
It had to be Nick and Doug.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.714
Houdini couldn't
make people disappear

26:21.748 --> 26:23.015
like these guys can.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.617
How the hell did they find
where Jason was staying?

26:24.651 --> 26:26.118
Are you saying
they found out from us?

26:26.152 --> 26:27.086
Why are you
hanging around here

26:27.119 --> 26:28.120
when you should be out
looking for Jason?!

26:28.154 --> 26:30.056
We've been busting
our asses.
Jason is missing!

26:30.089 --> 26:31.257
And Nick and Doug
are gonna walk,

26:31.290 --> 26:32.892
unless you call in
the troops to find him!

26:32.925 --> 26:34.093
We call in the troops,

26:34.126 --> 26:36.128
and everybody finds out
Jason is gone.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.865
You wanna think about that
for a second...

26:38.898 --> 26:41.000
or just keep
playing your blame game?

26:42.802 --> 26:45.037
Is that what this is?

26:45.071 --> 26:47.606
A game?

26:51.844 --> 26:53.946
I got her.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.127
I told Jason
everything would be okay.

27:08.160 --> 27:12.298
You don't know for sure
that it isn't.

27:12.331 --> 27:16.302
We both know something bad
happened to him.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.138
He trusted me,
and I let him down.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.873
Beating yourself up

27:20.907 --> 27:23.409
isn't gonna help us
find him any faster.

27:23.442 --> 27:26.412
[sniffles]

27:26.445 --> 27:29.281
You're right.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.118
This gets out,
I won't have a case.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.754
We have to keep it quiet.

27:34.787 --> 27:37.724
What's the next move?

27:37.757 --> 27:40.259
I have to tell the D.A.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.031
Why the hell wasn't Jason King
in protective custody?

27:45.064 --> 27:47.066
His parents volunteered
to take him out of town.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.702
With Nick Pratt and
Doug Waverly out on bail?

27:49.736 --> 27:50.903
It was only a matter of time

27:50.937 --> 27:53.940
till they found out
where Jason was.

27:53.973 --> 27:54.941
Is SVU tight?

27:54.974 --> 27:55.875
As a drum, sir.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.376
There's no way the leak
came from my people.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.246
Well, I doubt if it
came from Casey.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.248
That leaves
Liz Donnelly's office.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.382
I'll notify her.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.984
No, you won't.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.385
Not yet.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.287
You're not suggesting
that she's...

28:08.320 --> 28:09.321
The leak?

28:09.355 --> 28:10.757
Of course not.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.091
It's just that her people

28:12.124 --> 28:14.026
are the only ones
I can't vouch for.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.230
You know, if she stops
the trial now,

28:18.264 --> 28:20.232
double jeopardy attaches.

28:20.266 --> 28:24.136
We can never try Pratt or
Waverly on these charges again.

28:24.170 --> 28:24.971
Well, can't you read

28:25.004 --> 28:28.240
Jason's grand jury testimony
at trial?

28:28.274 --> 28:29.942
Not unless we can
prove he's been harmed.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.878
The 14th Amendment
gives Nick and Doug

28:31.911 --> 28:34.213
the right to face
their accuser.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.014
If we don't
find Jason soon,

28:35.047 --> 28:36.949
I'm gonna run out
of witnesses.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.317
Then get some more.
Keep our case alive.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.953
Stall as long as you can.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.858
(Novak)
Danna, on the night
that Jennifer disappeared,

28:45.892 --> 28:48.327
was it her idea
to go to the dance club?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.429
No, it was my idea.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.431
Did she ever seem
promiscuous?

28:52.464 --> 28:54.166
No, the opposite.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.501
I mean, she liked boys,

28:55.534 --> 28:57.770
but she wasn't, you know,
a slut or anything.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.171
(Novak)
Was she a party girl at home?

28:59.205 --> 29:01.007
(Ally)
Not really.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.209
But she wanted to have
a good time in New York.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.411
So how did she do in school?

29:05.444 --> 29:06.946
Jennifer was
a straight-A student.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.215
She'd already been accepted
on early admission

29:09.248 --> 29:10.917
to McGill University
in Montreal.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.319
Do you know if she ever
ran away from home?

29:13.352 --> 29:15.254
(Henry)
Only once.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.323
She'd had a fight
with her mother.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.359
Came over to my house,
slept over.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.128
Uh, in the guest room.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.797
And, uh, she went home
the next morning.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.332
Your Honor,
this is the tenth witness

29:26.365 --> 29:27.934
who's given the exact
same testimony.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.036
Counsel approach.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.110
Mr. Gates has a point,
Casey.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.512
Well, the jury needs
to know the victim.
We get it.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.281
Jennifer is a nice girl.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.050
Ms. Novak's wasting
this court's time.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.252
I appreciate you
looking out for my schedule.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.586
But I'll decide that.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.488
It's a stalling
tactic, Your Honor.

29:49.521 --> 29:52.191
You have no right to dictate
how I present my case.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.960
This is getting
a little redundant, Casey.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.161
Where's your
star witness,

29:55.194 --> 29:56.262
Jason King?

29:56.295 --> 29:58.264
I have five more
character witnesses.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.099
No, you don't.
Put Jason up next.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.567
He's not here.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.402
Then get him here.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.404
By tomorrow.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.041
We're in trouble.

30:09.075 --> 30:09.942
I heard.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.278
We can't bank on the police
to find Jason.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.179
Any advice?

30:13.212 --> 30:15.514
Well, when under attack,
circle the wagons.

30:15.547 --> 30:18.150
Go back to your office,
Casey.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.352
Relax.
Breathe.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.855
Then meet me downstairs
by my car at 6:00.

30:22.889 --> 30:25.958
We going somewhere?

30:28.360 --> 30:29.395
Arthur.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.596
Casey.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.264
We need to talk to you.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.100
In the middle of a trial?
I don't think so.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.402
The defense had their
ex-parte moment.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.304
In chambers,
not my living room.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.338
This is different.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.073
Can you step outside
a moment?

30:49.448 --> 30:51.250
Why the cloak and dagger
routine?

30:51.283 --> 30:53.920
We couldn't take the chance
your house was bugged.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.988
Bugged?

30:56.022 --> 30:57.323
Why would anybody
wanna bug my--

30:57.356 --> 30:58.324
Jason King,
our star witness,

30:58.357 --> 30:59.458
disappeared last week.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.127
We have evidence
he was kidnapped,

31:01.160 --> 31:03.429
but we can't prove it.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.297
The leak's not
in our office, Liz.

31:05.331 --> 31:06.298
Or SVU.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.334
Whoever took Jason had
to find out where he was

31:08.367 --> 31:09.501
from somebody
that works for you.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.437
You think I have
a mole in my office

31:11.470 --> 31:12.905
and you didn't tell me?

31:12.939 --> 31:13.973
My orders.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.507
If Jason's still alive,

31:15.541 --> 31:17.309
and the kidnappers find
that we're on to them,

31:17.343 --> 31:18.444
they could kill him.

31:18.477 --> 31:19.145
Couldn't risk it.

31:19.178 --> 31:22.048
We're going
to the courthouse.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.986
Casey never told me
Jason's location.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.087
She wrote it
on a piece of paper,

31:28.120 --> 31:31.123
which I shredded after
I dictated the information.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.225
To your secretary?

31:33.259 --> 31:34.526
To my Dictaphone.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.329
[echoing]
My secretary hasn't
transcribed the tape...yet.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.031
[echoing]
Is that me?

31:39.065 --> 31:41.267
[echoing]
I'm afraid so.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.371
[echoing]
Is that the bug?

31:45.404 --> 31:46.405
Yes, sir.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.441
Battery's still working.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.279
It could have
been there for months

31:53.312 --> 31:55.047
and I never
would have found it.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.548
Is there any way
to find out who bought it?

31:56.582 --> 31:57.649
This is a cheap one,

31:57.683 --> 31:59.485
available on the Internet
from dozens of vendors.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.353
The receiver should
be close by.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.055
I'll see if I can find it.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.360
Who would do
something like this?

32:08.394 --> 32:10.696
Nick Pratt
and Doug Waverly's parents

32:10.729 --> 32:12.498
have deep pockets.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.400
Probably bought
somebody off.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.234
I inherited my staff.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.403
I don't know that much
about them.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.105
And you can't
ask them now.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.509
We could sure use
a mistrial here, Liz.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.380
Unless you can prove
Nick Pratt and Doug Waverly

32:28.414 --> 32:31.517
bugged this office or that
they murdered Jason King,

32:31.550 --> 32:32.985
you haven't got grounds
for a mistrial.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.186
We're out of witnesses.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.521
I know, Casey.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.424
And I don't like it
any more than you do.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.693
But I can't play games
with the law.

32:41.727 --> 32:45.397
If you can find Jason
by tomorrow...

32:45.431 --> 32:48.100
or show me that he's
met with foul play...

32:48.134 --> 32:50.169
I'll grant a motion to have
his Grand Jury testimony

32:50.202 --> 32:51.570
read to the jury.

32:52.404 --> 32:55.607
Otherwise,
there's nothing I can do.

32:59.578 --> 33:02.514
(Donnelly)
Call your next witness,
Ms. Novak.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.753
The People rest,
Your Honor.

33:07.786 --> 33:10.689
Your Honor...the People
have clearly failed

33:10.722 --> 33:13.159
to meet their burden
of proof.

33:13.192 --> 33:17.496
Uh, we move for directed
verdicts for both defendants.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.665
For six days,

33:19.698 --> 33:22.768
the People have offered
dozens of witnesses

33:22.801 --> 33:25.104
and exhibits.

33:25.137 --> 33:29.108
And the only rational conclusion
this evidence supports

33:29.141 --> 33:32.111
is that the victim,
Jennifer Durning,

33:32.144 --> 33:35.047
was alive and well when last
seen with the defendants.

33:35.081 --> 33:36.715
Therefore,

33:36.748 --> 33:38.650
as a matter of law,

33:38.684 --> 33:42.521
this court has no choice
but to grant the defense motion.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.091
Mr. Waverly...

33:45.124 --> 33:46.692
Mr. Pratt...

33:46.725 --> 33:49.761
I am dismissing all charges
against you.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.297
You are free to go.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.599
[gavel pounds]

34:12.551 --> 34:15.854
I prefer shrimp cocktail
for an appetizer.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.823
This is the entree.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.260
Club soda, lime.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.731
That liquid lunch isn't
going to change what happened.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.366
Yeah, but...

34:27.399 --> 34:29.201
it'll help me forget.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.837
You played the hand
you were dealt.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.805
I had to look
Jennifer Durning's parents

34:33.839 --> 34:35.874
in the eye and tell them
that their daughter

34:35.907 --> 34:36.742
would never get justice.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.411
Because I let Nick Pratt
and Doug Waverly

34:39.445 --> 34:40.779
get away with murder.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.115
Well, that wasn't
your fault.

34:43.149 --> 34:45.751
But it will be if you let them
get away with another one

34:45.784 --> 34:47.719
and don't try
to stop it.

34:47.753 --> 34:48.920
We haven't found Jennifer.

34:48.954 --> 34:51.690
So what makes you think
Jason's gonna be any different?

34:51.723 --> 34:53.792
Because whoever planted
that bug in my office

34:53.825 --> 34:56.128
knows what happened to him.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.230
And you are going
to find that person

34:58.264 --> 34:59.531
if you have to interrogate

34:59.565 --> 35:01.800
everyone who works
in that courthouse.

35:01.833 --> 35:05.271
Trial's over, Casey.

35:05.304 --> 35:09.375
Put the gloves on
for round two.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.442
Have there been
any strange calls,

35:10.476 --> 35:12.911
like someone fishing for
information about the judge?

35:12.944 --> 35:15.447
No, Ms. Novak,
nothing like that at all.

35:15.481 --> 35:17.916
Anybody come in when
court's not in session?

35:17.949 --> 35:20.452
Nobody suspicious,
if that's what you mean.

35:20.486 --> 35:21.687
What about after hours?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.155
I mean, do you ever
stick around?

35:23.189 --> 35:24.223
All the time.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.492
But nobody ever comes
into the judge's chambers,

35:26.525 --> 35:28.360
except maybe
a court officer.

35:28.394 --> 35:29.795
And that's routine?

35:29.828 --> 35:31.397
Uh, not really.

35:31.430 --> 35:34.700
This one had to use
the judge's private bathroom.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.335
When was this?

35:36.368 --> 35:38.237
Maybe a week before
the trial started.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.406
I stayed late to pull a case
for the judge,

35:40.439 --> 35:41.607
stepped out
for a bite to eat.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.808
When I got back,
she was just getting out

35:42.841 --> 35:44.543
of the judge's office.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.912
She?
Yeah, new girl.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.314
Just assigned up here, uh...

35:48.347 --> 35:50.582
I think her name's Emily.

35:50.616 --> 35:53.385
You wanted to see me,
Your Honor?

35:53.419 --> 35:54.720
Officer McCooper,
what were you doing alone

35:54.753 --> 35:56.288
in this office
two weeks ago?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.259
I was...sick.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.860
I didn't think I could
make it to the ladies' room.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.195
Your chambers were closest,

36:03.229 --> 36:04.696
so I ducked in
and used your bathroom.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.532
Was that before
or after you planted this?

36:06.565 --> 36:08.400
What is it?

36:08.434 --> 36:09.435
(Stabler)
It's a bug.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.669
But you know that,

36:10.702 --> 36:12.904
because the receiver...

36:12.938 --> 36:14.340
was in your locker
downstairs.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.907
I listen to music
on that.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.443
You save it, sister.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.445
Now, how can you afford
a brand-new Mercedes

36:19.478 --> 36:20.879
on a court officer's salary?

36:20.912 --> 36:24.383
My father
bought me that car.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.817
You mean your sugar daddy,
Nicky Pratt.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.719
Because my old car
was about to fall apart.

36:27.753 --> 36:28.687
Well, it held
together long enough

36:28.720 --> 36:31.290
for you to go upstate
and pick up Jason King.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.525
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.860
What we're talking about,
young lady,

36:34.893 --> 36:36.262
is life in prison
without parole

36:36.295 --> 36:38.230
for murdering a witness
to a crime.

36:39.931 --> 36:40.966
(Stabler)
Sit down.

36:41.933 --> 36:42.968
Sit down.

36:45.571 --> 36:49.575
(Stabler)
We have the '89 Acura
you traded in.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.777
The tires match tracks

36:51.810 --> 36:54.946
found outside the house
Jason King was staying in.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.948
Now, our crime scene unit
is gonna vacuum

36:56.982 --> 36:58.984
every inch of that car.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.953
They find a hair...

37:01.987 --> 37:03.989
a drop of blood...

37:04.022 --> 37:07.326
that matches
Jason's DNA...

37:07.359 --> 37:09.961
Nicky...Nicky didn't say
they were gonna kill Jason.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.463
He just wanted
to talk to him.

37:11.497 --> 37:12.764
But he didn't know
where Jason was.

37:12.798 --> 37:13.932
So he asked you

37:13.965 --> 37:14.733
to bug my chambers

37:14.766 --> 37:17.369
and paid you for it
with a new car?

37:17.403 --> 37:18.837
That was a present.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.575
You're sleeping
with Nicky Pratt.

37:30.081 --> 37:34.720
I was walking him
out of court after arraignment.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.023
He said I probably looked
really hot out of uniform.

37:39.825 --> 37:43.762
Next thing I know,
we're in bed in my apartment.

37:43.795 --> 37:44.963
Nick used you, Emily.

37:46.498 --> 37:49.000
Don't let him ruin
the rest of your life.

37:52.538 --> 37:55.374
Did Nick send you
to get Jason?

37:57.476 --> 38:01.079
He said I should wait
till Jason's parents left.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.048
Then show Jason my shield

38:03.081 --> 38:07.319
and tell him you needed him
immediately.

38:07.353 --> 38:08.086
Where'd you take him?

38:08.119 --> 38:11.857
The...produce place

38:11.890 --> 38:14.626
Doug Waverly's father
owns in the Bronx.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.501
Thanks, Counselor.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.636
But Mr. Waverly Sr.'s
so convinced

38:24.670 --> 38:25.937
Doug didn't murder
anybody in here,

38:25.971 --> 38:27.406
he let us right in.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.807
Any luck?

38:28.840 --> 38:30.742
Crime scene and the pooch
are still inside searching.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.711
But all we found
was a lot of roughage.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.513
The court officer
brought Jason here,

38:34.546 --> 38:37.349
but maybe Nick and Doug
took him somewhere else.

38:37.383 --> 38:38.984
You know what
I'm thinking?

38:39.017 --> 38:40.952
If they know
this area so well,

38:40.986 --> 38:42.788
Jennifer's body's
not in Queens.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.823
It's gotta be
around here.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.692
And the Bayside Diner's
10 minutes

38:46.725 --> 38:48.093
over the Throgs Neck Bridge

38:48.126 --> 38:49.995
and down
the Clearview Expressway.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.963
But how did they get there
if they dumped her and the car?

38:51.997 --> 38:53.699
They had to be
driving something.

38:53.732 --> 38:57.469
Which means their asses
are on toll booth candid camera.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.070
All the exhaust and filth

38:59.104 --> 39:01.072
dirtying up the camera lens,

39:01.106 --> 39:03.875
how do these faces and plates
come out so clear?

39:03.909 --> 39:06.378
How does a spy satellite
see you taking a crap

39:06.412 --> 39:08.046
from 22,000 miles in space?

39:08.079 --> 39:09.681
Hold up, here we go.

39:09.715 --> 39:12.818
3:12 a.m., lane two,
right on the timeline.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.486
Doug Waverly?

39:14.520 --> 39:17.689
Yeah. But that's
no '71 Chevelle,

39:17.723 --> 39:19.691
and Waverly's paying
from the back seat.

39:19.725 --> 39:20.926
(Munch)
Of whose car?

39:20.959 --> 39:22.694
My car.

39:22.728 --> 39:23.829
Was he there too?

39:23.862 --> 39:25.831
You bet.

39:25.864 --> 39:26.898
Where'd you
pick them up?

39:26.932 --> 39:28.834
Bay Plaza Mall.
In the parking lot.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.503
This guy waved
a $100 bill at me.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.038
He says this is mine
if I drove them

39:33.071 --> 39:33.972
across the Throgs Neck
to Queens.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.475
They tell you what
happened to their car?

39:36.508 --> 39:37.576
Yes, that it was towed.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.044
By the police.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.619
Got it.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.622
Dried blood and hair
all over the trunk.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.157
That's gotta
be Jennifer's.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.092
The car was in our own pound
the whole time.

39:54.125 --> 39:55.627
We had the little bastards.

39:55.661 --> 39:58.129
We sent out a flyer
on this car!

39:58.163 --> 40:00.198
Yeah, well, whoever
checked it into the pound here

40:00.231 --> 40:01.467
reversed two of the numbers

40:01.500 --> 40:02.868
when they put it
into the computer.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.970
How many '71 Chevys
you got?

40:05.003 --> 40:06.204
Hey, we just
hook 'em and book 'em.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.138
Everybody makes mistakes.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.508
Your mistake just
let two killers walk.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.709
Elliot.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.977
She could have
been dumped anywhere.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.178
But at least we know
that this car

40:13.211 --> 40:15.113
was towed from that mall.

40:15.146 --> 40:16.848
This car wasn't
towed from a mall.

40:16.882 --> 40:19.518
What are you
talking about?

40:19.551 --> 40:21.219
Truck picked it up
for blocking a fire hydrant

40:21.252 --> 40:23.054
in Co-op City.

40:33.499 --> 40:35.033
It's the right address.

40:35.066 --> 40:37.235
Across from the river.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.904
[Benson sighs]

40:38.937 --> 40:41.039
They dump Jennifer's body.
By the time they get back,

40:41.072 --> 40:42.574
the car's been towed.

40:42.608 --> 40:43.742
Not gonna find
any cabs here,

40:43.775 --> 40:45.176
so they walk the 10 blocks
to the mall...

40:45.210 --> 40:46.512
Where they buy their ride
over the bridge

40:46.545 --> 40:47.913
to the diner in Queens.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.881
Called aviation.
They're sending in a bird.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.917
We brought out two dogs.
One's got Jennifer's scent.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.118
The other's looking
for Jason.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.086
Detectives!

40:55.120 --> 40:56.187
We got a woman's sneaker.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.255
Flo here is all over it.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.691
Must have
your victim's scent.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.493
I watched those videotapes
1,000 times.

41:01.527 --> 41:02.661
Jennifer was
wearing those

41:02.694 --> 41:04.262
the last time
she left the hotel.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.731
They dumped her
in the river,

41:05.764 --> 41:06.798
no telling
where she'll wash up.

41:06.832 --> 41:07.933
If she washes up.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.935
Which means Jason could
be shark bait too.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.069
(Benson)
Got something!

41:11.102 --> 41:12.170
Over here!

41:12.203 --> 41:14.139
What is it?

41:14.172 --> 41:18.209
Jason. Got caught
on the bridge somehow.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.211
Lucky us.

41:47.673 --> 41:50.976
You didn't
kill him, Casey.

41:51.009 --> 41:54.980
He was dead the minute he got
caught in Cousin Nicky's web.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.951
We have Jason's body.

41:59.985 --> 42:03.755
Let's get him some justice.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.900
You make a scene
and embarrass our families,

42:14.933 --> 42:17.168
I swear I will sue you all
for harassment.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.104
Save it for after
the trial, Mr. Waverly.

42:19.137 --> 42:20.572
What trial?

42:20.606 --> 42:22.207
Nick Pratt,
Doug Waverly,

42:22.240 --> 42:25.043
you're under arrest
for the murder of Jason King.

42:25.076 --> 42:26.612
You can't prove
we killed anybody.

42:26.645 --> 42:28.213
You like that sea bass?

42:28.246 --> 42:30.816
You're gonna love what we
just pulled out of the river.

42:30.849 --> 42:30.916
