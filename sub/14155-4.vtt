YOU HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS

07:31.919 --> 07:33.386
TO DO, I GUESS.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.187
>> YOU WANT ME TO CARRY

07:34.187 --> 07:34.988
SOMETHING?

07:34.988 --> 07:37.290
>> NOPE. I'VE GOT IT.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.427
>> * WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

07:40.427 --> 07:43.330
* ARE YOU CROSSING OCEANS?

07:43.330 --> 07:46.199
* ARE YOU JUST LIKE ME

07:46.199 --> 07:48.769

07:59.346 --> 08:01.048

08:01.048 --> 08:01.782
AND GO HOME, BUT YOU'RE A

08:01.782 --> 08:03.216
WONDERFUL PERSON, AND I HAVE

08:03.216 --> 08:06.787
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.055
>> HAVE A SAFE FLIGHT.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.690
>> I WILL.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.558
BE WAITING FOR YOU

08:10.558 --> 08:12.560
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.561
BYE.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.564

08:51.164 --> 08:53.200
WHAT'S UP?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.202
>> [groans]

09:04.211 --> 09:05.813
>> IT'S JUST SAD.

09:05.813 --> 09:06.947
>> YEAH.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.148
IT WAS A GOOD TRIP, THOUGH.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.049
>> OH, YEAH.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.852
IT WAS DEFINITELY UNEXPECTED.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.486
[laughs]

09:13.486 --> 09:15.155
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.356
LIKE, I JUST WANT TO

09:16.356 --> 09:17.925
TAKE THINGS SLOW.

09:17.925 --> 09:18.626
>> YEAH.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.492

>> THAT'S BEEN MY PLAN

09:26.066 --> 09:26.767
THE WHOLE TIME.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.534
>> YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THIS GO

09:27.534 --> 09:29.302
REAL QUICK.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.170
>> HE WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIT

09:30.170 --> 09:30.938
HIM.

09:30.938 --> 09:31.705

09:47.655 --> 09:49.690
INTIMIDATING, AND I WANT TO TAKE

09:49.690 --> 09:51.524
THIS ONE-ON-ONE TIME TO GET TO

09:51.524 --> 09:52.325

09:52.325 --> 09:53.961
I WANT SOME BOOZE.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.896
>> I SPENT MONEY THIS MORNING.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.064
>> WHAT DID YOU BUY?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.667

09:59.667 --> 10:00.668
ARE YOU LIKING LIVING WITH

10:00.668 --> 10:01.234
MICHELLE?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.502
>> IT'S OKAY.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.370
>> OH, YOU DON'T GOT TO BEAT

10:03.370 --> 10:04.304
AROUND THE BUSH, GIRL.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.572
I KNOW.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.240
>> THERE'S STUFF EVERYWHERE.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.276
HOW IS IT LIVING WITH CHELSEY?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.310

10:13.080 --> 10:13.914
LIKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS

10:13.914 --> 10:14.782
WRONG?

10:14.782 --> 10:15.949
>> I DON'T KNOW.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.384
I'M JUST MOODY.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.518
>> MAYBE YOU MISS YOUR

10:18.518 --> 10:19.452
BOYFRIEND.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.420
>> I DO.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.022
>> I HAVEN'T HAD A BOYFRIEND,

10:22.022 --> 10:23.857
GIRL, IN YEARS.

10:23.857 --> 10:24.925
IT'S JUST HARD LETTING PEOPLE

10:24.925 --> 10:25.893
IN, YOU KNOW?

10:25.893 --> 10:27.961
'CAUSE I REALLY HAVE, LIKE, A

10:27.961 --> 10:29.730
LOT OF COMMITMENT ISSUES.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.898
>> EVENTUALLY, YOU'LL FIND

10:30.898 --> 10:32.132
SOMEONE THAT WON'T LET YOU PUSH

10:32.132 --> 10:33.166
THEM AWAY THOUGH.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.201
>> DID YOU HAVE, LIKE, SOMETHING

10:34.201 --> 10:36.770
HAPPEN IN YOUR PAST TO PUSH GUYS

10:36.770 --> 10:37.637

10:37.637 --> 10:39.472
>> YEAH, I HAD A LOT OF STUFF,

10:39.472 --> 10:40.173
GIRL.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.208
>> REALLY?

10:41.208 --> 10:43.110
>> IT TAKES A LOT FOR ME TO WANT

10:43.110 --> 10:44.411

10:44.411 --> 10:45.278
>> YOU READY?

10:47.915 --> 10:49.883
BY NO MEANS AM I READY TO TELL

10:49.883 --> 10:51.451
HER ANYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.186
WE'VE PLANNED TO GO OUT FOR MY

10:53.186 --> 10:54.621
BIRTHDAY, SO IT WOULD BE NICE IF

10:54.621 --> 10:55.388
YOU COULD COME.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.690
>> THANK YOU FOR THE INVITE.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.825
I'LL BE THERE WITH BELLS ON,

10:57.825 --> 10:58.658
GIRL.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.728
>> ALL RIGHT.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.734
[heart monitor beeping]

11:06.734 --> 11:08.201
>> * THE ONLY EVIDENCE

11:08.201 --> 11:10.437

11:11.872 --> 11:13.306
WE'RE WATCHING OVER YOU.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.375
>> [crying]

11:15.375 --> 11:16.176
>> IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE,

11:16.176 --> 11:17.878
OUT THROUGH YOUR MOUTH.

11:17.878 --> 11:18.912
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE YOURSELF SICK

11:18.912 --> 11:20.147
BREATHING LIKE THAT.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.081
YOU'RE GONNA HYPERVENTILATE,

11:21.081 --> 11:23.050
OKAY?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.517
>> HEY, LOOK AT ME.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.919
YOU OKAY?

11:25.919 --> 11:27.921

11:29.256 --> 11:29.990
>> LOOK, YOU NEED

11:29.990 --> 11:31.124
TO CALM DOWN, OKAY?

11:31.124 --> 11:31.825
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THIS

11:31.825 --> 11:32.893
MEDICINE, BUT YOU'RE GONNA GIVE

11:32.893 --> 11:34.127
YOURSELF EVEN MORE OF A PANIC

11:34.127 --> 11:35.095
ATTACK.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.296
>> CHELSEY AND I ARE TAKING CARE

11:36.296 --> 11:37.197
OF A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WHO

11:37.197 --> 11:38.331
WERE IN A CAR ACCIDENT, AND

11:38.331 --> 11:39.032
RIGHT NOW THE DAUGHTER IS

11:39.032 --> 11:43.303
HAVING A PANIC ATTACK.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.138
>> SHE IS HAVING PROBLEMS,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.140
AND I NEED TO PRAY.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.680
>> SHE'S HURTING.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.514
I'M HURTING.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.116
>> I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.650
>> SHE DON'T WANT TO BE HERE

11:57.650 --> 11:59.519
IN HERE.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.520
>> RIGHT NOW, SHE NEEDS TO BE

12:00.520 --> 12:01.454
UNTIL WE GET ALL OF HER TESTS

12:01.454 --> 12:02.122
BACK.

12:02.122 --> 12:02.990
>> IT'S NOT JUST THE HOSPITAL IS

12:02.990 --> 12:05.092
WHAT SHE'S SAYING.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.127
SHE TOLD GOD SHE DON'T WANT

12:07.127 --> 12:10.831
TO BE HERE ANYMORE.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.165
>> SHE HAS STATED THAT SHE'S

12:12.165 --> 12:13.466
TALKED TO GOD AND SAID THAT SHE

12:13.466 --> 12:15.268
DOESN'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE,

12:15.268 --> 12:16.603
SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW,

12:16.603 --> 12:19.039
LIKE, LEGIT THAT IS.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.040
>> IF A PATIENT SAYS THAT'S

12:20.040 --> 12:21.174
THEY'RE SUICIDAL, WE NEED TO

12:21.174 --> 12:22.542
TAKE ALL PRECAUTIONS.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.811
THERE'S PROTOCOL, SUICIDE

12:23.811 --> 12:24.878
CHECKLISTS, YOU HAVE TO CALL THE

12:24.878 --> 12:25.979
PHYSICIAN, AND THEN I HAVE TO GO

12:25.979 --> 12:27.214
OVER A WHOLE QUESTIONNAIRE

12:27.214 --> 12:28.315
CHECKLIST TO GET A BETTER

12:28.315 --> 12:29.316
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY SHE'S

12:29.316 --> 12:31.051
HAVING THESE THOUGHTS.

12:31.051 --> 12:34.254
HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY PLANS OF

12:34.254 --> 12:35.823
SUICIDE OR IS THIS SOMETHING

12:35.823 --> 12:36.924
THAT YOU'VE THOUGHT OF?

12:36.924 --> 12:38.525
>> NOT TO KILL MYSELF.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.827
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE LIVING,

12:39.827 --> 12:41.995
BUT I DON'T WANT TO KILL MYSELF.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.263
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.832
>> YOU'VE NEVER PLANNED TO DO

12:44.832 --> 12:47.267
ANYTHING TO HARM YOURSELF?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.201
>> NO.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.102
>> DO YOU HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM

12:49.102 --> 12:51.104
AT HOME?

12:51.905 --> 12:53.907
>> YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.276
>> YOUR MOM AND YOU AREN'T ABLE

12:56.276 --> 12:57.544
TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER?

12:57.544 --> 12:58.979
>> WE TALK, BUT SHE DOESN'T LIKE

12:58.979 --> 13:00.213
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY, SO IT'S

13:00.213 --> 13:01.214
JUST...

13:01.214 --> 13:02.115
>> AND WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT SHE

13:02.115 --> 13:03.216
DOESN'T LIKE?

13:03.216 --> 13:04.117
>> I DON'T THINK I SHOULD BE

13:04.117 --> 13:04.952
HERE STILL.

13:04.952 --> 13:05.953
I FEEL LIKE I'M LEAVING MY LIFE

13:05.953 --> 13:06.854
ALREADY.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.088
>> DO YOU THINK IF WE HAD A

13:08.088 --> 13:09.489
THERAPIST COME TALK WITH YOU IT

13:09.489 --> 13:10.390
MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE

13:10.390 --> 13:11.324
BETTER?

13:11.324 --> 13:12.159
>> MAYBE.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.093
>> OKAY.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.494
JUST THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.863
DON'T THINK ABOUT ALL THAT

13:15.863 --> 13:17.865
STUPID STUFF.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.202
MY HEART REALLY GOES OUT FOR

13:22.202 --> 13:24.671
THIS GIRL, AND UNFORTUNATELY,

13:24.671 --> 13:25.672
CHANCES ARE, SHE'S GONNA BE

13:25.672 --> 13:26.974
DISCHARGED BEFORE I SEE HER

13:26.974 --> 13:27.674
AGAIN.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.641
ONE OF THE HARD PARTS ABOUT

13:28.641 --> 13:29.943
BEING A NURSE IS THAT YOU DON'T

13:29.943 --> 13:31.078
ALWAYS GET TO FOLLOW THROUGH

13:31.078 --> 13:32.880
WITH EVERY PATIENT, SO YOU NEVER

13:32.880 --> 13:34.882
KNOW WHAT THEIR END OUTCOME IS.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.896
>> OH, HEY.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.297
>> HEY, SOMBER SALLY.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.198
>> HI, YOU.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.732
>> HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:52.732 --> 13:53.967
>> NOTHING, I'VE BEEN STUCK WITH

13:53.967 --> 13:55.068
THIS FRICKIN' DEPRESSED WOMAN

13:55.068 --> 13:55.936
LATELY.

13:55.936 --> 13:56.769
>> SHUT UP.

13:56.769 --> 13:57.905
>> [laughs]

13:57.905 --> 13:58.671
>> I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR

13:58.671 --> 13:59.539
DAYS OFF, I CAN'T LIE.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.507
>> YEAH.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.408
>> I THINK YOU NEED TO DO

14:01.408 --> 14:02.142
SOMETHING.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.176
>> I WANT TO SEE HOLLYWOOD.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.244
>> I FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T BEEN

14:04.244 --> 14:05.278
TO THE BEACH AT ALL REALLY.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.247
>> WELL, WHAT ABOUT CATALINA?

14:07.247 --> 14:08.215
I'VE BEEN THERE.

14:08.215 --> 14:08.916
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

14:08.916 --> 14:09.549
IT'S A LITTLE

14:09.549 --> 14:10.683
ISLAND ON THE COAST.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.585
>> CAN IT JUST BE US, AND WHAT

14:12.585 --> 14:13.820
ABOUT HEATHER AND NIKKI?

14:13.820 --> 14:15.255
>> NO, I THINK WE HAVE TO INVITE

14:15.255 --> 14:16.323
THE WHOLE CREW.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.190
EVERYBODY.

14:17.190 --> 14:17.925
>> OH, COME ON.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.093
>> QUIT BEING A LITTLE BIATCH.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.528
>> I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.930
>> [laughing]

14:22.930 --> 14:24.297
>> AND YOU'RE A NURSE?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.698
>> I LIKE THEM INTUBATED AND

14:25.698 --> 14:26.599
SEDATED.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.600
>> [laughing]

14:27.600 --> 14:28.701
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO CATALINA.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.837
>> YEAH.

14:30.837 --> 14:31.571
>> TWERK.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.073
TWERK FOR CATALINA.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.008
>> TWERK FOR CATALINA.

14:35.008 --> 14:38.011
[all cheering]

14:40.013 --> 14:42.015
[laughter]

15:20.687 --> 15:21.688
>> LET'S DO THIS.

15:21.688 --> 15:22.655
>> I'M EXCITED.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.474
ON MY WALL.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.375
ADRIAN, WRITE SOMETHING NICE ON

15:42.375 --> 15:43.776

15:56.823 --> 15:59.326
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.394

>> WERE YOU BORN IN MEXICO?

16:09.936 --> 16:10.703

16:12.172 --> 16:13.940

16:27.120 --> 16:27.820
ACTUALLY.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.721
>> CHELS, ARE YOU SNORKELING?

16:38.798 --> 16:39.832

16:39.832 --> 16:41.168
"YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO DOWN."

16:41.168 --> 16:42.135

16:42.135 --> 16:44.071
>> HE IS SO RIDICULOUS.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.638
CAN YOU NOT JUST BE NORMAL?

17:22.842 --> 17:24.644
THE ONLY REASON WHY I REALLY

17:24.644 --> 17:25.612

17:25.612 --> 17:26.446
>> I KNOW.

17:26.446 --> 17:27.814
I'VE GIVEN UP ON CHRIS.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.416
>> I CAN NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH

17:29.416 --> 17:33.120
HIM, BUT I CAN BE CORDIAL,

17:33.120 --> 17:35.122
BECAUSE I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.823
AT THIS POINT, NO ONE REALLY

17:36.823 --> 17:38.658
LIKES HIM AS MUCH AS THEY SAY

17:38.658 --> 17:39.459
THEY DO.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.493
>> LIKING IS DIFFERENT FROM

17:40.493 --> 17:41.161
TOLERATE--

17:41.161 --> 17:41.828
>> YOU TOLERATE.

17:41.828 --> 17:42.495

18:30.009 --> 18:31.178
HE MEANS THAT WE'RE WET.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.345
>> IT MEANS YOU FLOAT WELL.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.347

18:47.227 --> 18:50.263
>> JUST IN GENERAL, I'VE NEVER

18:50.263 --> 18:51.598
PICTURED MYSELF GETTING MARRIED.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.632
LIKE, I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.633
I WANT TO DO THIS.

>> RIGHT.

18:58.871 --> 19:02.875
>> IT'S JUST A WEDDING WASN'T

19:02.875 --> 19:04.211
ON MY MIND.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.791
>> YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THIS NOT

19:18.791 --> 19:19.626
EVEN A LITTLE BIT?

19:19.626 --> 19:20.760
