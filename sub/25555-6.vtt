06:10.136 --> 06:12.371
going out with Aimee
and Nilsa a try,

06:12.438 --> 06:15.541

15:01.934 --> 15:03.402
Do you know
when you get off work?

15:03.469 --> 15:04.503
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:04.570 --> 15:05.871
<i>Babe, I have to</i>
<i>call you back.</i>

15:05.938 --> 15:07.706
<i>Be... all right...</i>
<i>I'll tap those down.</i>

15:07.773 --> 15:10.309
But I understand, like, you have
to work, you have to work.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.645
I don't want to be with a liar,

15:12.711 --> 15:15.047
because you can't trust somebody
or be with somebody

15:15.114 --> 15:17.983
that lies to you 'cause
at the end of the day,

15:18.050 --> 15:20.052
you only have your integrity
and your word.

15:29.328 --> 15:30.763
{\an8}(man)
Coming up...

15:30.829 --> 15:31.764
{\an8}(snoring)

15:31.830 --> 15:33.832
{\an7}(laughing)

15:33.899 --> 15:35.834
{\an8}Codi, wake up.

15:33.899 --> 15:35.834
{\an9}Hey.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.604
{\an8}You peed all over yourself.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.604
{\an8}You peed on yourself.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.306
{\an8}I don't (bleep) know
what happened.

15:40.372 --> 15:41.807
{\an8}(laughing)
I just pee-peed on myself.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.777
{\an7}I want you to be aware of
everything that's going on.

15:44.843 --> 15:46.945
{\an7}Logan has called me
several times.

15:47.012 --> 15:50.149
{\an8}When he calling your mama,
that's a red flag.

15:50.215 --> 15:52.484
{\an7}He's psycho over you.
It's scary.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.093
{\an8}So Logan has no job, right?

15:58.490 --> 16:01.093
{\an8}<i>Mm-mm.</i>

16:02.227 --> 16:03.162
{\an3}Wow.

16:09.935 --> 16:11.637
{\an8}My best friend's telling me
that my boyfriend's a liar.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.239
I mean, Raina
is very important to me.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.141
She would never lie to me,

16:16.208 --> 16:18.610
but she might exaggerate
the truth.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.346
I don't know what's going on.

16:31.990 --> 16:35.828
I hope that my mom and Raina
will help me get some clarity

16:35.894 --> 16:38.831
and figure out what the hell
is going on.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.670
{\an5}I'm not, I'm fine.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.670
<i>Just stay calm-- you promise?</i>

16:44.737 --> 16:46.238
{\an6}Yeah.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.238
<i>I love you.</i>

16:46.305 --> 16:47.406
{\an5}All right, bye.

16:46.305 --> 16:47.406
<i>Bye.</i>

16:50.576 --> 16:52.344
You good?

16:50.576 --> 16:52.344
No.

16:52.411 --> 16:56.749
Logan has been lying
to my mother, to Raina.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.217
He hasn't lied to me.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.752
He's lied to everybody
that I love.

16:59.818 --> 17:01.887
{\an1}Okay, well,
then that's a problem.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.989
{\an1}I almost would rather you lie
to me than lie to my mama.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.257
You know what I'm saying?

17:05.324 --> 17:07.159
Like, don't lie--
that's not cool.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.594
{\an4}Don't lie,
that's not cool.

17:07.226 --> 17:08.594
That's what
I was about to say.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.128
If you have those traits...

17:10.194 --> 17:11.896
If he's lying to them, he's most
likely gonna lie to you too.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.266
{\an4}He could be
a Hannibal Lecter.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.266
He could.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.101
{\an4}For real.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.101
Like, you don't somebody
after two weeks.

17:16.167 --> 17:17.970
{\an5}(Candace)
I'm just saying,
like, you don't know nobody.

17:18.036 --> 17:19.637
{\an8}Like, he could be out here
collecting bodies

17:19.704 --> 17:21.707
{\an8}and skinning people
and you don't know.

17:21.773 --> 17:23.742
{\an8}Like, you gotta
give people some time.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.310
{\an6}A what?

17:23.809 --> 17:25.310
{\an4}Hannibal.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.310
Hannibal Lecter.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.845
{\an1}You could go
to this man crib

17:26.912 --> 17:30.349
{\an1}and he got, uh,
skin faces on the wall.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.818
She's just saying you don't
know somebody after two weeks.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.220
{\an5}He could be a killer.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.220
{\an1}I'm saying there's
crazy people out here.

Do you feel good.

17:57.109 --> 17:58.310
{\an5}Feel better?

17:57.109 --> 17:58.310
I feel better.

Well, good.

18:00.045 --> 18:02.014
I'm finally feeling better
sick-wise,

18:02.080 --> 18:05.417
but now I have to deal with
all this Logan bull(bleep).

18:05.484 --> 18:07.019
Let me go step
outside for a second,

feels good.

Oh, yeah, it feels good--
that's it.

18:10.456 --> 18:11.824

Yeah, I'm getting
in this pool today.

18:16.528 --> 18:17.963
It's a nice day outside.
I'm like, mm-mm,

18:18.030 --> 18:20.032
I don't feel like going
to the gym today.

18:20.098 --> 18:21.467
We could play
that pool pong.

18:21.533 --> 18:22.668
{\an5}Oh, y'all two can play it, yeah.

18:21.533 --> 18:22.668
{\an3}Yeah.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.470
I'm not drinking beer.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.938
"Oh, I'm not drinking beer.

18:26.004 --> 18:27.406
I'm gonna go to the gym."

18:27.473 --> 18:29.675
{\an1}You know what, you sit there
and eat your little chips,

18:29.741 --> 18:32.811
{\an4}keep working on the Teletubby
body you got going on.

18:29.741 --> 18:32.811
{\an3}(laughs)

18:32.878 --> 18:34.046
Don't come at me, all right?

18:34.112 --> 18:36.448
{\an5}You know what?

18:34.112 --> 18:36.448
{\an1}(laughs)

18:36.515 --> 18:37.783
I love the keg bod.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.551
You know, I told you,
I want the keg bod,

18:39.618 --> 18:41.019
but by the end of the summer,

18:41.086 --> 18:43.088
{\an5}I want it to be
from a keg to a case.

18:41.086 --> 18:43.088
{\an1}All right.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.957
Dude, I'm, like, scared

18:45.023 --> 18:48.594
that I'm going to get
so pissed off.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.195
{\an4}Why?

18:48.660 --> 18:50.195
I'm literally just going

18:50.262 --> 18:52.097
to stand up and walk out.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.398
But why would you get upset?

18:53.465 --> 18:57.402
Because there's
too many (bleep) inputs.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.906
I want to meet my mom and Raina
with Candace

19:00.973 --> 19:03.675
to really get to the bottom
of all this Logan bull(bleep),

19:03.742 --> 19:06.011
and I'm actually really
freaking nervous.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.046
{\an1}If being with Logan
makes you happy, be with him.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.415
{\an1}If not being with him and
thinking about the lies

19:10.482 --> 19:11.917
{\an1}and him lying to your mama
don't make you happy,

19:11.984 --> 19:13.852
{\an1}then don't be with him,
but you need to do

19:13.919 --> 19:15.220
{\an1}what you need to do
to make you happy

19:15.287 --> 19:16.655
{\an1}and make this experience
good for you.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.156
It's gonna be all right.

19:18.223 --> 19:19.591
{\an5}Girl, you ready to go?

All right, come on.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.828

19:22.895 --> 19:26.131
I really just wanna be a support
system for Kortni right now.

19:26.198 --> 19:30.269
I want to get a real feel for
this Logan fella because...

19:30.335 --> 19:31.970
he could potentially
be a good dude,

19:32.037 --> 19:33.972
but he could also potentially be
a serial killer.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.641
I'm driving here.
I wanna know what's the...

19:35.707 --> 19:38.610
what's supposed to be
the resolution from today?

19:38.677 --> 19:41.179
Clarity. I need clarity
and I wanna know, like,

19:41.246 --> 19:44.550
what side's bullcrap
and what side's not.

19:46.451 --> 19:47.386
{\an4}Hello.

19:46.451 --> 19:47.386
How you guys?

19:47.452 --> 19:48.587
{\an8}Good, how are you?

19:48.654 --> 19:50.088
{\an8}Hi, Miss Sharon.

19:50.155 --> 19:51.557
You look wonderful.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.264
All right, we're gonna go
get some ice cream.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.599

gonna talk about some things,"

sometimes white family problems

20:08.106 --> 20:10.642

You know, I don't know if
I wanna dip my hands into that.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.181
{\an3}I did.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.281
{\an1}Ooh, my.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.983
{\an1}Just some red flags
have come up about Logan.

20:51.049 --> 20:53.318
Oh, Lord have mercy,
help me.

20:53.385 --> 20:56.722
{\an1}And I asked Logan
not to come

20:56.788 --> 20:59.825
{\an1}in the house
and do the nasty.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.226
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

20:59.891 --> 21:01.226
{\an1}Yeah.

21:01.293 --> 21:02.794
That was my fault.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.229
{\an1}That doesn't matter
if it's your fault or not.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.798
He gave me his word
that he was gonna be

21:06.865 --> 21:08.734
a young man and a gentleman,

21:08.800 --> 21:10.902
{\an1}and that's stuff that you do
when you're married.

21:10.969 --> 21:13.305
Okay, I think that's
irrelevant. Anyway...

21:13.372 --> 21:16.508
{\an1}And then I heard that he cussed
at you because of a,

21:16.575 --> 21:20.178
{\an1}a thing with the phones,
and all that's true, right?

21:20.245 --> 21:22.080
{\an5}That we were yelling
at each other?

21:20.245 --> 21:22.080
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.281
Yeah.

21:31.623 --> 21:35.661
{\an1}Kortni, if someone loves you,
they don't cuss at you.

21:35.727 --> 21:37.129
{\an1}If he talks to you
like that again,

21:37.195 --> 21:38.463
{\an1}he and I are gonna have
an issue,

21:38.530 --> 21:40.232
and so is he and your dad.

21:40.298 --> 21:42.501
{\an3}Next topic.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.369
Next topic?

21:44.436 --> 21:46.171
He's lied to me
about his jobs.

21:46.238 --> 21:49.474
{\an1}He wasn't working
for the pool company anymore.

21:49.541 --> 21:52.844
{\an1}He didn't tell me
that her dad let him go.

21:52.911 --> 21:55.380
{\an1}That may have been him saying,
"Well, I just want her mom

21:55.447 --> 21:56.915
"to think I'm
good enough for her

21:56.982 --> 21:58.817
{\an1}and I don't want her to think
that I don't have a job."

21:58.884 --> 22:00.986
He asked me to go
to lunch with him.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.255
{\an1}The bill came
and she set it by me...

22:03.321 --> 22:05.357
{\an1}(laughing)
...and he pulled out a dollar.

22:05.424 --> 22:08.360
{\an4}(Candace)
Oh, Lord.

22:05.424 --> 22:08.360
{\an1}And says,
"Oh, I only have a dollar."

22:08.427 --> 22:11.029
{\an1}And that's just not
what you do

22:11.096 --> 22:12.798
{\an1}when you take someone's
mother out to lunch.

22:12.864 --> 22:14.099
{\an1}Like, sometimes I think
he's mature

22:14.166 --> 22:15.233
{\an1}and then other times
I think he's really immature,

22:15.300 --> 22:16.234
you know what I mean?

22:16.301 --> 22:18.737
{\an1}Kinda like
he was going around

22:18.804 --> 22:20.839
trying to make me not
like Raina's mother.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.474
{\an1}I shouldn't have to ask him to,
like, clean up after himself

22:22.541 --> 22:23.742
{\an1}over and over
and over and over.

22:23.809 --> 22:26.878
{\an1}He got thrown off the stage
at the Club La Vela.

22:26.945 --> 22:28.980
My dad had to tell him,
he said, he said,

22:29.047 --> 22:30.115
{\an1}"No more calling me
about Kortni."

22:30.182 --> 22:31.783
Like, I, I saw the text.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.653
{\an4}Are you, are you listening,
Kortni, though?

22:31.850 --> 22:34.653
{\an3}Yeah.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.054
(Candace)
That's a red flag.

22:36.121 --> 22:37.622
{\an8}I wasn't anticipating
all of this.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.258
{\an1}It's like he's like...
up and down.

22:40.325 --> 22:42.527
It's really making me
look at Logan differently.

22:42.594 --> 22:45.831
He hopped out in your car and
sped away as fast as he could,

22:45.897 --> 22:49.000
{\an5}throwing your car sideways.

22:45.897 --> 22:49.000
Nuh-uh, that's my car
at the end of the day.

22:49.067 --> 22:52.471
It's my fault if he gets
into... a wreck.

with him at all.

30:47.111 --> 30:48.746

30:50.348 --> 30:51.849
{\an3}Right.

30:51.916 --> 30:52.850
Codi...

30:52.917 --> 30:54.118
No date tonight.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.420
{\an1}No date?

30:55.486 --> 30:56.888
And then I'ma just
let you know right now,

30:56.955 --> 30:58.556
{\an1}if the mother(bleep) tries me,
I'm gonna try...

30:58.623 --> 30:59.624

31:05.730 --> 31:06.831

31:06.898 --> 31:08.099
I'm gonna do
what I gotta do.

31:08.166 --> 31:09.634
I mean, if he tries
to put his hands on me,

31:09.701 --> 31:11.603
then either or two options
are gonna happen.

31:11.669 --> 31:13.738
I'm gonna kick his ass
or he's gonna kick mine.

38:16.861 --> 38:19.530
and somebody that
genuinely loves me for me.

38:19.597 --> 38:21.465
Guess what?

38:21.532 --> 38:23.334
Gator's coming tomorrow!

38:23.401 --> 38:24.769
{\an1}Oh...!

38:24.835 --> 38:26.837
I'm so excited.

38:30.541 --> 38:34.045
♪♪

38:38.182 --> 38:39.750
(Codi)
What time is it?

38:39.817 --> 38:41.085
{\an5}Like... nine.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.085
{\an3}9:00?

38:41.152 --> 38:43.087
{\an1}GatorJay gonna
be here tomorrow.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.488
Yes.

38:44.555 --> 38:47.391
{\an5}Can't wait to meet him.

38:44.555 --> 38:47.391
I can't either.

38:47.458 --> 38:48.759
{\an5}(laughter)

38:47.458 --> 38:48.759
This is gonna suck.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.528
I'm going to bed.

38:50.594 --> 38:52.997
{\an8}I feel bad for Codi,
like, I really do.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.865
You see he has a huge
crush on Candace,

38:54.932 --> 38:56.834
and now he's gotta watch Candace
be with her boyfriend here

38:56.901 --> 38:58.302
for the next couple of days.

38:58.369 --> 39:00.404
This isn't gonna be easy.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.039
{\an1}There's still a little salt
in those wounds.

39:02.106 --> 39:04.308
{\an4}Oh, there's some (bleep)
that's gonna go down.

39:02.106 --> 39:04.308
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.710
(Gus)
Ain't gonna take long.

39:05.776 --> 39:07.144
{\an1}I just hope
I don't forget his full name.

39:07.211 --> 39:09.947
{\an1}(Gus)
Gatorade?

39:10.014 --> 39:11.816
GatorJay231...

39:11.882 --> 39:13.117
SouthsideGod.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.586
I'm not calling a grown-ass man
that, I'm sorry.

39:15.653 --> 39:16.887
(Gus)
I can promise you one thing.

39:16.954 --> 39:18.956
I'm not calling him
that ridiculous name

39:19.023 --> 39:20.324
and I'm not calling
any man a god,

39:20.391 --> 39:21.992
because I am strong in my faith.

39:22.059 --> 39:23.994
{\an1}There's only one reason
why you made a name like that.

39:24.061 --> 39:25.529
It's 'cause your name's
probably something soft.

39:25.596 --> 39:26.697
(Kortni laughs)

39:26.764 --> 39:27.865
I'm thinking it's Schuyler.

39:27.932 --> 39:29.900
Or... Ralph.

39:29.967 --> 39:31.402
I'll just start
calling him Clarence.

39:31.469 --> 39:34.038
(laughter)

39:34.105 --> 39:35.906
(Nilsa)
I don't like this at all.

39:35.973 --> 39:39.510
We should be respectful and call
Candace's boyfriend by his name.

39:39.577 --> 39:42.379
{\an8}GatorJay... 231... SouthsideGod.

39:42.446 --> 39:45.316
But the boys are saying
that they aren't gonna call him

39:45.382 --> 39:48.152
SouthsideGod, they aren't gonna
call him GatorJay.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.354
They wanna find out what
his real name is, and it's like,

39:50.421 --> 39:52.523
"If that's what Candace
calls him,

39:52.590 --> 39:53.791
"how about we be respectful

39:53.858 --> 39:56.627
and call Candace's guest
what Candace calls him?"

39:56.694 --> 39:57.628
{\an1}(Nilsa)
Candace, come here.

39:57.695 --> 39:59.230
(Candace)
What's wrong?

39:59.296 --> 40:01.098
{\an5}I just want you to know
that the boys aren't--

39:59.296 --> 40:01.098
What happened?

40:01.165 --> 40:03.033
{\an1}The boys aren't address
Gator as GatorJay.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.301
They're gonna... they said,

40:04.368 --> 40:06.337
{\an1}"I'm not gonna
address a man like that."

40:06.403 --> 40:09.340
Wha-at? Wha-at...?

40:09.406 --> 40:11.742
Not even "what."
Wha-at?

40:11.809 --> 40:13.944
Gator hasn't even
walked through the door

40:14.011 --> 40:16.747
and you're already starting
drama over his name.

40:16.814 --> 40:19.416
Oh, my goodness, what's
gonna happen when he get here?

40:19.483 --> 40:22.286
So...

40:22.353 --> 40:23.921
{\an8}What are they gonna be
addressing him as?

40:23.988 --> 40:25.356
{\an8}They said Schuyler.

40:25.422 --> 40:27.124
{\an8}Jeremiah said Clarence.

40:27.191 --> 40:29.827
{\an8}His name is GatorJay231.

40:29.894 --> 40:32.463
{\an7}They can call him Daddy,
that's what they can call him.

40:32.530 --> 40:34.398
{\an7}Please come up here
and correct me.

40:34.465 --> 40:38.402
{\an7}Come correct me, baby!
Come correct me!

40:38.469 --> 40:40.371
{\an7}Nilsa's telling
what we were talking about.

40:40.437 --> 40:41.839
{\an9}Oh, boy.

40:41.906 --> 40:43.808
{\an7}It's about to be
a all-out madhouse.

40:43.874 --> 40:45.242
{\an8}I'm waiting on it!

40:45.309 --> 40:46.977
{\an8}'Cause all y'all mother(bleep)

40:47.044 --> 40:50.681
{\an8}is pussies...!

40:50.748 --> 40:52.249
{\an8}I just want y'all
to know for the record,

40:52.316 --> 40:53.417
{\an8}Codi didn't have nothing
to do with this (bleep).

40:53.484 --> 40:56.086
{\an8}Codi did not say a word.

40:56.153 --> 40:58.522
{\an8}(Codi)
Hell, I'm just glad
I'm not the one in trouble.

40:58.589 --> 41:00.157
{\an8}(laughing)

41:00.224 --> 41:01.158
I'm going down there now.

41:01.225 --> 41:02.159
{\an5}Oh! Oh, oh...

41:01.225 --> 41:02.159
Oh...

41:02.226 --> 41:03.294
I don't need no backup!

41:03.360 --> 41:04.361
She better not try

41:04.428 --> 41:05.796
{\an1}to lay a hand on me,
I swear to God.

41:05.863 --> 41:07.965
Oh, (bleep),
here we go.

41:08.032 --> 41:10.935
{\an8}It's gonna be eight seconds
before Gus starts crying.

41:11.001 --> 41:12.870
{\an1}Wait, wait, wait!
Candace, wait!
