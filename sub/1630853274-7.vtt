00:09.443 --> 00:13.247
Look,
let's just both take a breath.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.651
My mama slaps me harder
than that.

00:17.685 --> 00:21.622
<i>True immortality rests
in a pure and mighty will...</i>

00:23.324 --> 00:26.594
<i>...for history isn't written
by the feeble masses.</i>

00:26.627 --> 00:29.563
<i>It is written and rewritten
by soldiers</i>

00:29.597 --> 00:31.031
<i>carrying the banner of kings.</i>

00:31.065 --> 00:34.535
There she is, machos.
Our destiny.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.104
<i>That is what it means
to be strong.</i>

00:37.138 --> 00:39.407
I want you to know
that I fired those bastards.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.778
They had no right roughing
you up the way they did.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.482
You are the first person
that I am aware of

00:48.516 --> 00:50.184
to publicly accuse
the president

00:50.217 --> 00:52.219
of responsibility
for the Watergate break-in.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.587
Pretty sure
I won't be the last.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.223
How do you feel about your wife
potentially speaking to the Senate?

00:56.257 --> 00:59.293
Well, I support Martha
in whatever she decides to do.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.061
I'm testifying on Monday.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.229
<i>They said
the judge was sending you</i>

01:02.263 --> 01:04.799
to a bad prison
for a long time.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.267
When I was a boy,

01:06.300 --> 01:10.104
my only friend was my nanny,
Frau Teresa.

01:10.137 --> 01:12.406
She told me the story of a boy

01:12.440 --> 01:14.375
who, from the power
of his own will,

01:14.408 --> 01:16.677
<i>became the leader
of her Fatherland.</i>

01:16.710 --> 01:20.815
She made me realize that I, too,
could choose to be strong.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.217
This will be
Father's trial by fire.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.186
I'm at the center
of this thing.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.454
I mean, that guy--

01:26.487 --> 01:28.589
Well, what if you're the guy
who saw an injustice

01:28.622 --> 01:31.192
and decided to do something
about it?

01:31.225 --> 01:32.793
Mr. Dean, Mr. Dean,
how do you feel?

01:32.827 --> 01:35.196
Everyone seems to think
you did pretty darn good.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.364
I hear Martha is on deck
for Thursday.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.367
The problem...

01:40.401 --> 01:42.603
with loving something too much

01:42.636 --> 01:44.271
is that you can't do
what needs to be done.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.276
I trust you'll do
what needs to be done.

02:23.511 --> 02:27.281
I don't, uh, know
where I end up on this thing.

02:27.314 --> 02:31.785
According to this, I was born
in the Year of the Rat.

02:31.819 --> 02:36.790

and inspiring to others.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.493
Somebody's been reading
your mail.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.828
Fuck off.

02:40.861 --> 02:44.365
It also says
I can be happy on my own

02:44.398 --> 02:47.535
or make an outstanding partner.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.203
I'll be sure
to inform your wife.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.706
Yeah, good idea.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.211
What's going on
with these girls?

02:57.244 --> 02:58.879
I thought they were supposed
to be here at seven.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.682
John, you're not screening them
for the secretarial pool.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.318
As long as they know
their way around an inseam--

03:04.351 --> 03:05.619
I don't think they heard you
in the kitchen.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.555
Who gives a shit?

03:07.588 --> 03:09.857
Nobody speaky
the Engrish around here.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.193
You're a terrible man.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.428
I've learned it all from you.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.829
But before they do come in,

03:15.863 --> 03:17.731
there's something you should
probably know about your girl.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.533
I-I...
Don't tell me she's a cryer.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.701
I can't deal
with another cryer.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.938
No, nothing like that.
But she's married.

03:28.742 --> 03:29.843
Married?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.279
- Not happily.
- Oh, Christ.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.415
As though I-I don't have
enough stress in my life.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.716
So she's married.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.451
You've been with married girls
before, and this...

03:37.484 --> 03:40.621
this broad's got a rack
like Claudia Cardinale.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.756
You're gonna love her.
Trust me.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.658
She's a real alley cat, boy.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.393
Yeah, I should go.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.861
No, why?

03:47.895 --> 03:50.698
Because these girls
are 20 minutes late,

03:50.731 --> 03:53.233
and the only marriage
I can stand getting in the way of

03:53.267 --> 03:54.501
right now is my own.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.537
Come on, don't be like this, John.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.772
Look. Hey, speak of the devil.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.874
Ladies,
we've been waiting for you.

04:00.908 --> 04:05.279
Sorry. It was bumper-to-bumper
all the way to Columbus Circle.

04:05.312 --> 04:08.282
<i>Hey, John,
this is Peggy Quinn.</i>

04:09.650 --> 04:10.884
- Pleasure.
- <i>And, uh,</i>

04:10.918 --> 04:12.319
<i>I'm sorry, darling.
What's your name again?</i>

04:12.353 --> 04:15.356
- Martha Jennings.
- <i>Martha Jennings.</i>

04:15.389 --> 04:17.925
<i>John Mitchell,

04:17.958 --> 04:19.460
I'm-I'm John.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.696
I heard.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.897
Are you going somewhere?

04:24.898 --> 04:27.735
Uh, no, I was, uh--

04:27.768 --> 04:29.470
Looking for the coatroom.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.472
Yes, could you take this?
Thank you.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.773
Could you point me
toward the restroom?

04:32.806 --> 04:34.608
No, no, no. I'll walk you.
It's right over there.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.043
Okay, great. Thank you.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.277
Would you?

04:37.311 --> 04:39.613
Oh, sure. Sorry.

04:40.814 --> 04:41.915
Thank you.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.017

05:07.474 --> 05:11.512
Well, evidently,
Peggy likes to talk.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.480
That she does.

05:13.514 --> 05:17.051
Ken tells me the same
about you, marriage-wise.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.487
Wow, those two are cut
from the same cloth.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.855
Absolute vipers.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.390
Mm.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.928
Can I come
a little closer to you?

05:32.032 --> 05:35.402
Now, there's one thing
you can say for marriage.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.538
Makes everything beyond it

05:37.571 --> 05:38.839
a little more fun.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.644
Little more, uh, beautiful.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.784
Oh, um...

05:50.818 --> 05:52.986
it's a little...
you have an eyelash.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.394
Yeah, make a wish.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.530
You know,
I don't believe in wishes.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.632
Well, I don't believe
in wasting them.

Thank you.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.706
Where is everybody?

07:52.739 --> 07:57.711
Your lawyer opted
for a closed-door session, Ms. Mitchell.

07:57.744 --> 08:01.481
No press. Take a seat.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.017
Now, we've got
a long day ahead of us,

08:04.051 --> 08:07.120
so let's get to it.

08:07.154 --> 08:11.725
I understand, uh, you have
an opening statement prepared.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.160
Yes, Sam. Thank you.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.828
<i>Mr. Chairman, before we begin,</i>

08:14.862 --> 08:17.965
I would just like to register
the minority's skepticism

08:17.998 --> 08:21.635
regarding the relevance
of Mrs. Mitchell's testimony.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.872
It's still unclear to me
what official role

08:24.905 --> 08:26.573
she held
within the administration.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.710
Senator Gurney,
as Mrs. Mitchell's counsel stipulated,

08:29.743 --> 08:33.647
she maintained an official
public relations role

08:33.680 --> 08:35.282
within
the Committee to Re-Elect.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.050
Mm-hmm.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.685
Doing what,
appearing on game shows?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.187
Ed, that's--

08:40.220 --> 08:41.655
Now just hold on a second.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.156
I was employed in the campaign

08:43.190 --> 08:45.225
at the direct request
of the president.

08:45.259 --> 08:46.793
Oh, and I'm sure

08:46.827 --> 08:50.731
we're all very appreciative
of your tireless dedication

08:50.764 --> 08:51.865
to your own celebrity...

08:51.899 --> 08:53.166
Pardon me?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.835
...but I'm still unsure
what any of that has to do

08:54.868 --> 08:57.704
with the matters that, uh, we are
examining in this committee.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.873
Honestly, Ed,
this is beneath you.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.775
Senator Gurney will suffice.

09:01.808 --> 09:04.711
Not according to your wife.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.079
- Mr. Chairman.
- Order.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.715
With all due respect,
there are significant facts

09:08.749 --> 09:12.786
that this witness
has failed to disclose.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.122
I would like to submit
this official report

09:15.155 --> 09:17.624
from Bellevue Hospital.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.760
<i>So submitted.</i>

09:20.928 --> 09:21.995
It indicates that

09:22.029 --> 09:24.064
Mrs. Mitchell
was institutionalized

09:24.097 --> 09:25.832
<i>after the birth
of her daughter,</i>

09:25.866 --> 09:27.668
<i>January of 1961.</i>

09:29.336 --> 09:33.106
It was given to me
by a close, personal source.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.913
Your father suffered
from acute mental illness,

09:39.947 --> 09:41.114
just like you.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.216
Isn't that so?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.687
I do not suffer
from acute mental illness.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.092
<i>In interviews,</i>

09:52.125 --> 09:53.961
<i>you have stated
that your father</i>

09:53.994 --> 09:58.966
<i>died in a car accident,
but that isn't true, is it?</i>

09:58.999 --> 10:00.600
<i>In fact, he, uh...</i>

10:00.634 --> 10:02.803
<i>he was
a drunken, degenerate gambler,</i>

10:02.836 --> 10:06.640
<i>a fanaticist prone
to paranoia, delusion,</i>

10:06.673 --> 10:08.809
and, ultimately, suicide.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.978
What's your point, Ed?

10:11.011 --> 10:14.147
<i>Isn't it possible
that your instability</i>

10:14.181 --> 10:17.718
<i>could perhaps have been
passed down from your father?</i>

10:17.751 --> 10:20.921
Could it be that--that
that's why you see conspiracies

10:20.954 --> 10:24.091
and plots where--
where none, in fact, exist?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.934
<i>'Cause if there is an issue
with her mental stability--</i>

10:33.967 --> 10:35.402
There are no issues.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.738
<i>Then why risk your marriage?</i>

10:37.771 --> 10:40.140
<i>Why risk
your husband's position?</i>

10:48.749 --> 10:52.786
Mrs. Mitchell, why risk the happiness
of your own daughter?

10:55.222 --> 10:57.124
Because it's the truth.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.927
It is the truth.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.697
And what about your husband?

11:03.730 --> 11:06.867
Does he share your
understanding of the truth?

11:21.214 --> 11:22.983
What the fuck are you doing?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.322
What are you doing?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.358
You told them everything.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.226
Told who what?
What are you talking about?

11:33.260 --> 11:35.028
<i>You know exactly
what I'm talking about.</i>

11:35.062 --> 11:36.163
You set me up.

11:36.196 --> 11:40.367
You gave them the knife, and you told them
exactly where to stick it!

11:40.400 --> 11:43.403
Sweetheart,
I only wanted to keep you

11:43.437 --> 11:46.840
on the right side
of this whole goddamn thing.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.809
You're the one
who wanted to testify.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.080
Oh, my God,
you're driving me crazy!

11:53.113 --> 11:56.016
<i>You make me feel
like I am losing my mind!</i>

11:56.049 --> 11:57.451
<i>What's going on?</i>

11:57.484 --> 11:58.785
<i>Go back to your room, honey.</i>

11:58.819 --> 11:59.920
- <i>But--</i>
- Now!

12:01.221 --> 12:03.924
<i>Oh, cleaning up
after Martha again.</i>

12:03.957 --> 12:05.258
I've grown so used to it.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.094
<i>Big John Mitchell,
lord of the manor,</i>

12:07.127 --> 12:08.728

to a man who won't even return
his phone calls.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.266
Okay. Just--you're just drunk.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.968
<i>It's enough. Another drunk.</i>

12:15.001 --> 12:16.002
<i>Martha's on another--</i>

12:16.036 --> 12:17.971
Blow it out your ass, Mitchell!

12:18.004 --> 12:19.005
- Yeah.
- Huh?

12:19.039 --> 12:20.373
Yeah.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.209
I've been watching you for months
just sitting around here,

12:22.242 --> 12:24.344
staring at the phone
like some teenage girl,

12:24.377 --> 12:28.815
waiting for a call from the boy
with the magic fingers.

12:28.849 --> 12:32.252
When are you gonna get it
through your thick fucking skull

12:32.285 --> 12:36.156
that nobody
on the whole fucking planet

12:36.189 --> 12:38.792
gives a goddamn what you think?

12:38.825 --> 12:40.327
Plenty of people care
what I think.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.030
Barbara Walters wants me
on the <i>Today</i> show to tell my story.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.432
Huh? My story!

12:45.465 --> 12:48.468
They're just looking
for a fucking sideshow!

12:48.502 --> 12:51.304
And that's you, lady!

12:51.338 --> 12:53.073
Do you know why Dick
hasn't called you back,

12:53.106 --> 12:55.108
why he hasn't made any effort
at all to contact you?

12:55.142 --> 12:56.877
Oh, fuck off!

12:56.910 --> 12:59.312
Because he doesn't give a shit.

12:59.346 --> 13:02.449
He never gave a shit
about you, ever!

13:04.317 --> 13:06.820
You think you're so much better
than the rest of them, right?

13:06.853 --> 13:07.854
Don't you?

13:07.888 --> 13:10.457
Dean, Magruder, Haldeman.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.359
Oh, they're just in it
for the money or ambition,

13:12.392 --> 13:14.161
but you're the only one

13:14.194 --> 13:17.898
dumb enough to think
you actually matter to Dick,

13:17.931 --> 13:20.834
that he valued your friendship.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.170
Hey, Martha, I am warning you--

13:23.203 --> 13:26.239
You have ruined everything
in your life, in my life!

13:26.273 --> 13:30.477
Your reputation, your marriage,
and for what?

13:30.510 --> 13:31.811
For what?

13:31.845 --> 13:34.080
I can't stand the sound
of your voice!

13:34.114 --> 13:35.415
Well, that makes two of us!

13:35.448 --> 13:38.018
- I can't stand to look at you!
- I can't stand you!

13:38.051 --> 13:41.288
- I can't stand your face!
- Get fucking off of me!

13:41.321 --> 13:43.823
<i>I love you, Martha,</i>

13:43.857 --> 13:47.460
'cause you're America's clown
and you're a pig.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.497
And all your moaning
and bitching

13:50.530 --> 13:52.165
<i>and your morning drinking</i>

13:52.199 --> 13:56.236
<i>and your day drinking
and your night drinking,</i>

13:56.269 --> 13:59.172
and your own daughter
has to fish you out of the tub

13:59.206 --> 14:02.475
'cause you're too stoned
on pills and booze to stand.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.877
Whose idea were the pills?

14:03.910 --> 14:05.078
- To stand!
- Who?

14:05.111 --> 14:06.379
I thought it would help you!

14:06.413 --> 14:09.282
I didn't know you were gonna
eat them like M&M's!

14:09.316 --> 14:11.218
It's the only way I can sleep
in my bed

14:11.251 --> 14:13.220
when it smells
like your whores.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.222
Oh, you fucking bitch.

14:15.255 --> 14:19.025
I should have had them
go harder on you in California.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.164
- What did you just say?
- Yeah, you heard me.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.867
Even you can't be
so fucking dense

14:27.901 --> 14:32.105
as to think that this was just
an overzealous bodyguard.

14:33.173 --> 14:36.076
<i>You're a cheap joke, Martha.</i>

14:36.109 --> 14:38.578
<i>And every fucking word</i>

14:38.612 --> 14:41.348
that comes out of your mouth

14:41.381 --> 14:45.952
humiliates you
and humiliates me.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.224
<i>Is it--</i>

14:51.258 --> 14:52.392
- See, no.
- No.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.594
- <i>No, no.</i>
- No.

14:54.628 --> 14:58.565
I'm leaving you,
and I'm taking Marty with me.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.670
<i>I'm not going to let her
watch you melt the fuck down.</i>

15:05.572 --> 15:07.540
No.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.276
No. No, you will not.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.011
You can't take her.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.079
You can't--wait.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.949
Mitchell,
you will not take my daughter.

15:15.982 --> 15:19.919
You--I know what you've done.
I'll tell everyone.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.055
You and Dick, both of you,

15:22.088 --> 15:23.690
worse than the break-in
at Watergate,

15:23.923 --> 15:25.292
worse than anyone knows.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.299
And who the hell is gonna
believe you, Martha,

15:32.332 --> 15:34.000
after all this?

15:34.034 --> 15:36.970
Who's gonna believe
little Martha?

15:37.003 --> 15:41.975
I'm just realizing this is my
favorite new position with you.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.443
What's that, Martha?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.412
You're gonna have to speak up,

15:45.445 --> 15:48.315
'cause for once,
I can't hear you.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.630
Go back to your room, honey.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.703
Oh, I love this.
This is great.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.171
<i>How groovy.</i>

16:11.204 --> 16:12.272
Yeah, maybe we could do

16:12.305 --> 16:13.973
<i>a little uh, shaken not stirred.</i>

16:14.007 --> 16:15.208
<i>That's great.</i>

16:15.241 --> 16:17.377
Hey, sweetheart,
can you fix his hair?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.079
<i>Right on.</i>

16:19.112 --> 16:20.280
<i>Just one thing more.</i>

16:20.313 --> 16:21.514
I'm the first married woman
in <i>Playboy.</i>

16:23.583 --> 16:26.586
Great. Um, could you put
your arm around her?

16:28.088 --> 16:29.089
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:30.690 --> 16:32.726
Gotta say, Mr. Dean,
for a man who just went through

16:32.759 --> 16:34.260
a nationally televised gauntlet,

16:34.294 --> 16:36.096
you seem to be
in incredible spirits.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.330
Oh. Well, thank you.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.734
I, uh... I didn't go
through it alone, so...

16:40.767 --> 16:43.036
Why did you decide to come out
and speak at all?

16:43.069 --> 16:45.438
I mean, wouldn't it have been
easier if you'd kept quiet?

16:45.472 --> 16:46.706
Well, sure.

16:46.740 --> 16:50.377
Um, I guess you could
say I, uh--I saw an injustice,

16:50.410 --> 16:53.446
and I decided to say
something about it.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.481
Simple as that.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.317
<i>And, uh, how have you held up</i>

16:57.350 --> 16:59.319
throughout this experience,
Mrs. Dean?

16:59.352 --> 17:02.722
I imagine
it's been uh, difficult.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.357
On the contrary, uh,

17:04.391 --> 17:07.360
I think when you strip
everything away from someone,

17:07.394 --> 17:09.596
you know,
all the power and prestige,

17:09.629 --> 17:14.200
that's when you really get a glimpse
of who they truly are inside.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.336
John and I have gotten to know
each other more completely

17:16.369 --> 17:19.272
than we would have
if Watergate had never happened.

17:19.305 --> 17:22.542
And that's, um--that's a gift.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.178
<i>You'll have to be sure and
send a thank-you card to the president.</i>

17:25.211 --> 17:26.312
Right.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.681
Straight up his ass.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.183
Don't--don't print that.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.420
Oh, would you, um-
Would you excuse me?

17:33.453 --> 17:35.288
Please don't print that.

17:35.321 --> 17:36.723
Um...

17:36.756 --> 17:38.558
Oh, Charlie. Come on in.

17:38.591 --> 17:41.094
<i>Hey, everybody, this is
Charlie Shaffer, my lawyer.</i>

17:41.127 --> 17:44.564
This is, uh, Anthony
and Joaquin from <i>Playboy.</i>

17:45.732 --> 17:47.634
I'm trying to convince them
to give us the centerfold.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.369
John, do you mind if I talk to you
in private?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.771
- It's, uh, urgent.
- Oh, sure. Uh, excuse us.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.239
Just through here.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.379
You want a ice water
or a Prosecco?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.381
We're doing mimosas.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.482
No, thanks.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.653
Hey, look, uh,

18:06.686 --> 18:08.488
I know you said keep
the interviews to a minimum,

18:08.521 --> 18:10.557
but, you know, it's <i>Playboy.</i>

18:10.590 --> 18:13.159
And, uh, they said
they might even publish

18:13.193 --> 18:16.496
one of Mo's short stories,
so cheers.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.265
Yeah, I'm-I'm not, uh,
here about that.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.235
Um, John, do you wanna, uh,

18:22.268 --> 18:23.670
maybe sit down
in the other room?

18:23.703 --> 18:25.538
No, I'm fine. What's going on?

18:25.572 --> 18:27.707
I got word on
Sirica's preliminary ruling

18:27.740 --> 18:29.142
on your case.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.545
He's recommending
a sentence of five years.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.317
W-what? I testified.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.752
I was the first to flip.
I-I cooperated.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.287
He took that into account.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.189
A reduced sentence
was never part of the deal.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.325
Then what the hell did I go
through all this for then, huh?

18:45.358 --> 18:48.695
Ostensibly because you wanted to do
what was best for the country.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.164
Oh, fuck that.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.266
John, the good news
is that you can still

18:53.299 --> 18:55.435
appeal for leniency
if you cooperate further.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.604
The special prosecutor's going
after Haldeman and Ehrlichman

18:57.637 --> 18:59.205
and--and then Mitchell.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.373
No, no, no way.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.674
I am not ratting
on anybody else.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.877
- John, I hear you.
- That was not part of the deal, Charlie.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.311
They can't ask me to do that.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.315
They're not asking you
to do anything, John.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.417
You obstructed justice.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.452
You broke the law.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.254
Fuck that, Charlie.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.689
People break the law
all the time.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.826
What, you think Kennedy's boys
didn't color outside the line?

19:19.859 --> 19:22.395
Or Johnson's or Roosevelt's?

19:22.428 --> 19:24.163
They all lied.
They all cheated.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.498
And not a single one of them

19:25.532 --> 19:26.933
would hesitate to do it again
if it suited their needs.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.335
- Maybe.
- No, definitely, Charlie.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.337
Definitely.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.206
So how do they get
to walk away scot-free,

19:33.239 --> 19:37.644
and I'm the one
who spends five years

19:37.677 --> 19:40.179
testifying against my friends,
sleeping in a cell?

19:40.213 --> 19:41.915
Fuck.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.683
Oh, God.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.421
You're not wrong, John.

19:48.454 --> 19:51.291
Thing is, those guys...

19:51.324 --> 19:52.325
they didn't get caught.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.361
You did.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.336

29:21.460 --> 29:24.463
<i>"I was foolish to think
my trial was nearing its end."</i>

29:27.433 --> 29:30.269
<i>"It seems now to have
only just begun.</i>

29:31.437 --> 29:34.273
<i>"I realize now that
life had brought me here</i>

29:34.306 --> 29:37.209
<i>"to my unholy solitude
in this cell,</i>

29:37.243 --> 29:39.211
<i>"waging holy war with a demon</i>

29:39.245 --> 29:42.481
<i>"I know all too well..."</i>

29:42.515 --> 29:45.151
<i>"...my own weakness."</i>

29:51.323 --> 29:53.292
<i>"I now know that
it has been lying in wait</i>

29:53.325 --> 29:55.294
<i>"inside of me all this time,</i>

29:55.327 --> 30:00.566
<i>"festering, growing,
quietly gathering strength</i>

30:00.799 --> 30:04.803
<i>"as it prepares
to devour me whole.</i>

30:04.837 --> 30:07.106
<i>"And the only way for me
to defeat it now</i>

30:07.139 --> 30:11.143
<i>"is to flush it out and crush it
once and for all."</i>

30:47.446 --> 30:48.948
Where are you?

30:48.981 --> 30:50.082
What do you want?
What do you want?

30:50.115 --> 30:51.283
What do you want, some food?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.085
Oh, the food.
I'll play with ya.

30:53.118 --> 30:55.521
I'll play with--no, no.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.258
Come on, where are you?

30:59.291 --> 31:00.326
Where are you?

31:00.359 --> 31:01.360
Come on, come out.
Come on, come on.

31:01.393 --> 31:02.995
Come on out.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.164
Come on out, come on out!

31:14.907 --> 31:16.208
Oh come on, come on!

31:27.186 --> 31:28.988
I strike at thee!

31:36.562 --> 31:38.931
Shut the fuck up,
you nutcase!

31:39.999 --> 31:42.468
God damn it, Liddy,
you crazy fuck!

31:42.501 --> 31:43.936
Oh, Jesus.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.638
Liddy, Liddy.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.274
Get up. Get the fuck up.

31:48.307 --> 31:51.110
Come on.

31:51.143 --> 31:54.680
- Leave it, leave it.
- I had him!

31:54.913 --> 31:56.949
Leave it!

31:56.982 --> 32:01.153
I had him! I fucking had him!

32:26.211 --> 32:27.713
The wheelie king.

32:29.682 --> 32:33.719
Oh, my.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.423
Nice boy.

32:44.430 --> 32:45.731
Mm.

33:28.374 --> 33:32.010
Oh.

33:52.264 --> 33:56.568
Slumber party time, baby.

33:59.471 --> 34:00.506
Baby.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.343
Marty.

34:04.376 --> 34:09.081
Shh.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.062
Mm.

34:30.369 --> 34:33.539
Mm, your bed is nice.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.741
Mm, baby...

34:37.676 --> 34:42.581
...it's just gonna be the two
of us for a little bit, okay?

34:42.614 --> 34:46.351
Okay. It's good.
We'll have fun.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.787
We can listen
to all your records.

34:51.390 --> 34:54.126
We don't need Daddy right now.

34:55.561 --> 34:57.629
Just you and me, baby.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.273
I called Dad.

35:10.509 --> 35:13.779
Um, I'm gonna stay with him
for a couple months...

35:15.848 --> 35:17.583
...until school starts up.

35:20.219 --> 35:21.787
I'm sorry.

35:23.655 --> 35:28.293
I just--just need to go.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.667
We can, um, celebrate
birthdays together,

35:35.701 --> 35:37.369
and we'll see each other
for Christmas.

35:37.402 --> 35:40.138
That'll be so fun.

35:40.172 --> 35:41.173
Okay?

35:46.745 --> 35:47.880
Mom?

36:05.464 --> 36:06.798
<i>As Congress begins</i>

36:06.832 --> 36:08.934
<i>its historic
impeachment inquiry,</i>

36:09.167 --> 36:10.903
I take a moment
to sit with the woman

36:10.936 --> 36:12.604
who claims to know more

36:12.638 --> 36:15.574
about the inner workings
of Watergate than anyone else.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.843
The indomitable,
the formidable,

36:17.876 --> 36:20.512
the complicated
Martha Mitchell.

36:20.546 --> 36:25.217
She joins us to set the record
straight right after this.

36:26.785 --> 36:29.721
<i>I'm sorry, Mrs. Mitchell,
but you're wanted onstage.</i>

36:29.755 --> 36:31.356
Thank you.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.758
<i>All right.
We'll see you in a minute.</i>

36:41.867 --> 36:44.570
<i>It's a throbbing
of my heart to the beat of the wing!</i>

36:44.603 --> 36:47.739
<i>It's me and Carol riding off
into the sunset!</i>

36:47.773 --> 36:50.475
Welcome back to the <i>Today</i> show.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.979
Last Monday night, I received
a telephone call from someone

36:54.212 --> 36:58.317
I had not heard from in quite
some time, Martha Mitchell.

36:58.350 --> 37:01.386
For the past two months,
Mrs. Mitchell has been living alone

37:01.420 --> 37:03.455
in a luxurious
Washington apartment

37:03.488 --> 37:05.657
her husband used
to call the Taj Mahal.

37:05.691 --> 37:06.858
Her husband, John Mitchell,

37:06.892 --> 37:09.795
left her after
a 16-year marriage.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.997
He now lives
in a Georgetown hotel.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.967
Some say that in a matter of weeks,
Mr. Mitchell is expected to be indicted

37:15.000 --> 37:18.604
by a grand jury for conspiracy,
obstruction of justice,

37:18.637 --> 37:21.807
and perjury in connection
with the Watergate break-in.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.576
Mrs. Mitchell told me
that she would like to clear up

37:24.610 --> 37:27.746
some matters which have
been reported inaccurately.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.781
We asked her to appear
on this program.

37:29.815 --> 37:34.252
She gave us her word that
she would, and now she's here.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.787
Good morning, Barbara.
How are you?

37:35.821 --> 37:37.322
<i>I'm fine.</i>

37:37.356 --> 37:39.725
I'm sorry I cannot welcome you
to the Taj Mahal.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.860
Well, we welcome you here.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.329
It's a lonely place,
but it's awfully pretty.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.432
You have said,
and you said to me last week,

37:47.466 --> 37:49.768
that President Nixon
is asking his subordinates

37:49.801 --> 37:53.705
to take the blame for things
of which he is guilty.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.041
What do you know, Martha?

37:56.274 --> 37:59.578
Well, Barbara, you can't say
that I-I know anything,

37:59.611 --> 38:01.713
and I would tell this to
the Senate Watergate Committee

38:01.747 --> 38:03.448
if they ever asked
to see me again,

38:03.482 --> 38:06.518
is that I am now so confused
by what I have read,

38:06.551 --> 38:07.919
what I've heard,
what I've seen,

38:07.953 --> 38:10.455
that I-I-I-I couldn't
possibly be a good witness,

38:10.489 --> 38:11.890
not in the slightest.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.893
Do you think the president
should be impeached, Martha?

38:14.926 --> 38:17.629
I have no idea whether
the president should be impeached.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.531
I can't answer that.
I'm not sitting in--

38:19.564 --> 38:20.832
Let's move on.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.000
<i>Let- let me ask you some
questions about you.</i>

38:22.034 --> 38:22.968
Oh, Martha.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.037
- Let's talk about Martha.
- Great.

38:25.070 --> 38:29.441
I started out by asking you,
why after 16 years,

38:29.474 --> 38:32.377
why after a marriage
that looked awfully good

38:32.411 --> 38:33.445
to an awful lot of people, why--

38:33.478 --> 38:34.680
- It was. It was great.
- Why-

38:34.713 --> 38:36.348
It was the greatest thing
in the world.

38:36.381 --> 38:39.584
You think perhaps somebody's
forced him to leave you?

38:39.618 --> 38:41.553
I think very definitely,

38:41.586 --> 38:43.622
because a man
doesn't tell you two weeks

38:43.655 --> 38:47.492
before he walks out and causes
a conspiracy on his wife

38:47.526 --> 38:49.361
that it's legitimate,
put it that way.

38:49.394 --> 38:51.029
Why do you think they did this,
Martha?

38:51.063 --> 38:53.465
Whoever they are?

38:53.498 --> 38:54.666
Well, I don't--I don't know.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.736
That would be, uh,
hard for me to say.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.705
I--

38:59.738 --> 39:02.908
Again, I just need
to get myself

39:02.941 --> 39:04.443
back to a train of thought

39:04.476 --> 39:07.679
where I'm not so emotionally
involved, you see?

39:07.713 --> 39:09.815
I need to do a doctorme--

39:09.848 --> 39:12.951
documentary on the whole thing
to analyze it.

39:14.086 --> 39:16.021
Yes.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.390
When you called me
the other day,

39:18.423 --> 39:19.758
you said something to me.

39:19.791 --> 39:23.829
Very frankly, you said,
"Barbara, a lot of people

39:23.862 --> 39:26.531
say that-that I drink,
that I am an alcoholic..."

39:26.565 --> 39:27.833
Why are you watching this?

39:27.866 --> 39:29.401
<i>"...and that that's why
I say a lot of things."</i>

39:29.434 --> 39:31.036
- It's depressing.
- <i>Let me interrupt you.</i>

39:31.069 --> 39:32.537
Do you drink, Martha?

39:32.571 --> 39:34.806
Do you drink when you
make those phone calls?

39:34.840 --> 39:37.442
What I--
When I make phone crawls?

39:37.476 --> 39:40.545
Phone calls?

39:40.579 --> 39:43.515
What I think has happened, Barbara,

39:43.548 --> 39:48.120
is that the--the media has kind of
built me into this sort of character,

39:48.153 --> 39:49.688
and a lot of people
don't even know me.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.556
Martha, we have
three minutes left.

39:51.590 --> 39:52.924
Is that all?

39:52.958 --> 39:56.928
I know you have a lot of fans
watching, Martha.

39:56.962 --> 40:00.565
What would you most want them
to know about things now?

40:02.701 --> 40:06.471
I think just that...

40:06.505 --> 40:09.441
the trying things
that have been imposed on me--

40:09.474 --> 40:12.944
no one in this country realizes
or understands

40:12.978 --> 40:16.148
that I-I'm working very hard.

40:16.181 --> 40:19.151
I'm not just sitting
in an apartment lonely.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.186
I-I'm doing a great deal
of research on this book,

40:21.419 --> 40:22.420
and you've done a book.

40:22.454 --> 40:24.189
You know how much work
it takes.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.893
And--and I have other offers

40:27.926 --> 40:31.062
and all kinds of various
and sundry things

40:31.096 --> 40:33.064
and other things
to keep me busy.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.634
I'm not just sitting lonely.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.068
I ha-I have my bad days.

40:37.102 --> 40:40.539
I have days
when I'm terribly blue,

40:40.572 --> 40:43.441
but other days when--

40:43.475 --> 40:47.512
when I-I-I can get ahold
of myself and- and go ahead.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.749
So just that's all that.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.752
And, uh--and also,
I-I want to say to all the people

40:53.785 --> 40:55.821
who have always
corresponded with me

40:55.854 --> 40:58.790
that my mail
hasn't been coming through.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.692
Well, we've laughed together,

41:00.725 --> 41:02.928
we've been
on programs together,

41:02.961 --> 41:04.663
and I want to just say now

41:04.696 --> 41:06.231
that I think
for a great many people

41:06.464 --> 41:09.701
that you have, at this point,
our compassion.

41:09.734 --> 41:11.770
We look forward to your book.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.905
We know it's been
a hard time for you,

41:13.939 --> 41:16.775
and I thank you for being here
and for expressing yourself.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.076
Thank you, Barbara.

41:18.109 --> 41:20.545
We'll be right back
after this message.

41:20.579 --> 41:21.813
<i>And we're out.</i>

41:21.847 --> 41:23.081
<i>That was wonderful.
Thank you.</i>

41:23.114 --> 41:24.683
Thank you.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.885
And you look beautiful,
and I really hope I see you again,

41:26.918 --> 41:29.120
and I'm thinking about you
and your family.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.689
- Take good care.
- <i>Okay.</i>

41:30.722 --> 41:32.524
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.797
She can kiss
that book deal goodbye.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.068
"<i>Dearest Frances,</i>

42:17.102 --> 42:19.804
<i>"I'm not sure
if I'm really writing to you</i>

42:19.838 --> 42:23.275
<i>"or if this is all
happening in my head.</i>

42:23.308 --> 42:26.144
<i>"I don't know if I ever told you
about what eventually became</i>

42:26.177 --> 42:28.947
<i>"of my beloved nanny,
Frau Teresa.</i>

42:30.548 --> 42:33.685
<i>"She killed herself
after the war.</i>

42:33.718 --> 42:36.821
<i>"Mother said it was because
she suffered from hysteria,</i>

42:36.855 --> 42:38.757
<i>"a mental sickness,</i>

42:38.790 --> 42:41.226
<i>"but I knew the truth.</i>

42:41.259 --> 42:44.863
<i>"She was destroyed
by the death of the Fuehrer...</i>

42:47.232 --> 42:51.002
<i>"...toppled by life's unceasing
splendor and cruelty."</i>

42:53.104 --> 42:56.875
<i>"I always hated her
for giving in to that sadness.</i>

42:56.908 --> 42:58.910
<i>"But now I understand her.</i>

43:00.245 --> 43:04.349
<i>"Our noble leader, too,
has been devoured by rats,</i>

43:04.582 --> 43:07.319
<i>"and their sickness

43:12.223 --> 43:14.225
<i>"I know now what
Frau Teresa was doing</i>

43:14.259 --> 43:16.928
<i>"with that rope around her neck.</i>

43:16.962 --> 43:19.664
<i>"She wasn't killing herself.</i>

43:19.698 --> 43:23.368
<i>"She was freeing herself

<i>"If they ask...</i>

43:27.605 --> 43:29.908
<i>"tell the boys
I died in battle."</i>

44:29.167 --> 44:34.039
Fraulein... Teresa?

44:34.072 --> 44:37.208
This fight is waged for the child.

44:39.844 --> 44:41.713
What is wrong, dear boy?

44:44.416 --> 44:45.717
Hush...

44:47.152 --> 44:48.787
Hush...

44:52.757 --> 44:55.026
I lost my strength.

44:56.895 --> 45:01.900
You must give in to be strong, dear boy.

45:07.138 --> 45:09.274
Give in...

45:10.141 --> 45:11.376
...and let go.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.482
Dear boy...

46:37.962 --> 46:42.267
I found you! I found you!

46:42.300 --> 46:45.503
I knew it!

47:13.598 --> 47:16.501
Oh, this bad motherfucker's...

47:32.083 --> 47:34.886
Oh, oh. Fuck, I can...

47:38.990 --> 47:40.191
Huh?

47:40.225 --> 47:43.027
I knew it! I knew it!

47:57.308 --> 47:58.309
No.

47:58.343 --> 47:59.477
No, no, no.

47:59.510 --> 48:01.546
No, no, no, no, no!

48:38.516 --> 48:41.586
- So that's it, huh?
- Yeah.

48:45.423 --> 48:49.327
I don't know what I was picturing.
It doesn't look like a jail to me.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.130
Well, it's--
it's a military base.

48:52.163 --> 48:56.934
This is--this is home sweet home
till we testify.

48:56.968 --> 48:59.404
Hunt's in there,
Colson, Magruder.

48:59.437 --> 49:01.272
Huh. Getting the gang
back together now?

49:11.416 --> 49:13.985
How much longer do we have?

49:15.153 --> 49:17.155
Three minutes.

49:19.090 --> 49:21.225
You don't have to stick around,
you know?

49:21.259 --> 49:24.729
I-I'd understand if you wanna--
if you wanna move on,

49:24.962 --> 49:26.264
find somebody else.

49:26.297 --> 49:28.266
Oh, I already have another boyfriend.

49:31.336 --> 49:32.503
I'm serious.

49:32.537 --> 49:34.639
Five--five years
is a long time.

49:34.672 --> 49:38.276
I am...

49:38.309 --> 49:39.310
yours.

49:42.146 --> 49:44.182
I'm in this,
even if I'm not in there.

49:46.084 --> 49:48.419
That said, I was thinking

49:48.453 --> 49:51.089
I could pull some strings
with the airline.

49:51.122 --> 49:52.256
Oh, yeah?

49:52.290 --> 49:54.092
Yeah, I think I could get us
as far as Manila.

49:54.125 --> 49:56.027
We could change our names.

50:08.706 --> 50:11.509
I'm sorry.

50:11.542 --> 50:12.577
I love you.

50:28.326 --> 50:31.429
Oh, here are my dates.

50:57.088 --> 50:58.089
Bye.

51:49.707 --> 51:51.776
Marty left her books.

51:53.377 --> 51:54.712
She's in the car.

51:59.884 --> 52:01.819
Uh...

52:07.825 --> 52:11.195
This is, uh, all of them.

52:23.808 --> 52:25.443
Well...

52:27.845 --> 52:29.647
...I guess that's it.

52:33.784 --> 52:37.421
She said that you, uh--
your migraines were acting up.

52:38.723 --> 52:40.491
Oh, um...

52:43.494 --> 52:46.864
I'm fine, thank you.
Thank you for asking.

52:50.468 --> 52:53.738
Well, take care of yourself.

52:53.771 --> 52:55.473
Wait, Mitchell, I just
wanna talk to you for a minute.

52:55.506 --> 52:56.607
- No, no. Please.
- Just--just--

52:56.641 --> 52:57.808
- Martha, don't.
- Please.

52:57.842 --> 52:59.443
- I just--
- Martha, don't. Don't.

52:59.477 --> 53:02.847
I just wanna talk to you for a minute.
I just wanna--

53:02.880 --> 53:05.583
I know I'm a disappointment
to you, Mitchell.

53:05.616 --> 53:08.753
<i>And I-I've been an embarrassment
with the press</i>

53:08.786 --> 53:11.222
<i>and the--and the interviews,</i>

53:11.255 --> 53:13.291
and I've learned my lesson,
and I'm just ashamed,

53:13.324 --> 53:14.625
and I'm sorry.

53:15.793 --> 53:19.230
But I know I can do better
and go back to the way

53:19.263 --> 53:21.465
that it used to be
with you and me.

53:23.234 --> 53:26.637
Just please stay here with me.

53:26.671 --> 53:27.738
Please?

53:29.240 --> 53:31.542
Please don't
leave me here alone.

53:37.782 --> 53:40.885
I'll send someone for the rest
of Marty's things.

54:09.380 --> 54:11.315
<i>Well, he's handsome,
for starters,</i>

54:11.349 --> 54:13.951
and well-established at his firm.

54:13.985 --> 54:15.519
Is he boring?
He sounds boring.

54:15.553 --> 54:16.854
Oh, God, no.

54:16.887 --> 54:18.656
No, he's the kind of guy
you could really cut loose with.

54:18.689 --> 54:19.890
Look, he's a card,

54:19.924 --> 54:21.859
and he has the most macabre
sense of humor.

54:21.892 --> 54:23.928
- No.
- I'm telling you, Martha.

54:23.961 --> 54:25.730
You're really gonna like
this guy.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.031
