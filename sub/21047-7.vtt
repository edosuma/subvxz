00:00.016 --> 00:01.882
<i>Previously on "Blood Drive"...</i>

00:01.898 --> 00:04.187
All your security privileges
are revoked,

00:04.234 --> 00:05.890
and you're not to leave the building.

00:05.929 --> 00:09.103
But know this, you will never
be a part of your race again.

00:09.105 --> 00:10.671
When you work for Sergeant Gower,

00:10.673 --> 00:12.206
- you stick to the rules.
- The docs cleared me.

00:12.208 --> 00:14.008
I'm going back out there.
Those freaks have my partner.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.982
Until ContraCrime clears you,
sit on your ass.

00:17.038 --> 00:20.206
Say hello to Christopher 2.0.

00:20.208 --> 00:21.540
What the hell did you do to me?

00:22.610 --> 00:24.610
Karma fell in the revolt.

00:24.612 --> 00:26.512
What... what do you mean?

00:26.514 --> 00:29.048
Karma's dead.

00:29.050 --> 00:30.683
Is that all you got?

00:30.685 --> 00:32.384
I know what you're trying to do.

00:32.386 --> 00:34.153
You want to be punished for your guilt.

00:34.155 --> 00:37.056
I don't know how I can do this
without you anymore.

00:39.327 --> 00:40.693
We are convinced

00:40.695 --> 00:42.695
this is the right direction
for the race,

00:42.697 --> 00:44.530
just the thing the division needs.

00:44.532 --> 00:46.031
Enough.

00:48.169 --> 00:52.438
This race is more than... entertainment.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.640
More than testing the blood engines,

00:54.642 --> 00:56.642
a technology so powerful

00:56.644 --> 00:59.278
it's set to restructure
the economic system

00:59.280 --> 01:01.180
of the entire planet.

01:01.182 --> 01:03.048
No, this race...

01:06.554 --> 01:10.189
Is the greatest sacrifice
in human history.

01:10.191 --> 01:13.058
It's a bloodstained altar,

01:13.060 --> 01:15.661
the gore-soaked peak of a Mayan temple,

01:15.663 --> 01:18.264
the smoke from an erupting volcano

01:18.266 --> 01:20.032
on Mount Olympus!

01:21.369 --> 01:23.736
And that pleasing aroma

01:23.866 --> 01:25.913
is not for God.

01:26.007 --> 01:28.077
It's for Heart Enterprises,

01:28.242 --> 01:32.048
the most powerful corporation
in the known universe!

01:33.447 --> 01:38.217
But this sacrifice
could be for you as well.

01:40.354 --> 01:42.092
This is what we're offering.

01:42.189 --> 01:45.108
Not a job, not a career, but...

01:45.259 --> 01:47.726
the chance to be worshipped.

01:47.827 --> 01:50.740
Master of Ceremonies? Fine.

01:50.765 --> 01:53.971
God of the Stage? Sure, whatevs.

01:54.252 --> 01:57.236
But if you have just a modicum

01:57.238 --> 02:00.272
of the oily black soul
that we think you do,

02:00.385 --> 02:04.589
well, when this show goes live
to the whole world,

02:04.712 --> 02:07.012
you'll be the High Priest of Heart.

02:10.418 --> 02:12.584
We need fresh blood...

02:12.706 --> 02:14.370
by the gallon.

02:14.455 --> 02:17.373
And you, sir, have the swagger
and the verve

02:17.412 --> 02:20.006
we want at Heart Enterprises.

02:20.127 --> 02:22.328
The Blood Drive is yours.

02:22.488 --> 02:25.042
All you have to do is claim it.

02:25.132 --> 02:26.498

02:38.450 --> 02:41.098
you've made the right decision.

03:50.101 --> 03:51.369
<i>Dear diary,</i>

03:51.405 --> 03:55.407
I wonder if all the other cops
know how small my dick really is.

03:57.077 --> 03:59.304
Seriously, what is that?

03:59.413 --> 04:01.546
Something a friend told me once.

04:01.582 --> 04:03.281
Do you write down what I say?

04:03.317 --> 04:05.316
Only when you say something smart.

04:05.351 --> 04:07.485
So... no.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.553
- Ha.
<i>- Please pull forward.</i>

04:11.090 --> 04:12.456
You gonna order or not?

04:12.492 --> 04:14.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up.

04:15.761 --> 04:17.560
Got to get the right thing.

04:17.596 --> 04:20.351
She doesn't even know you exist.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.930
Why would she care what you eat?

04:21.966 --> 04:23.399
Trust me, they care.

04:23.547 --> 04:25.768
Would you date a guy
who ordered a veggie burger?

04:26.671 --> 04:29.672
Depends. Is he cute?

04:34.513 --> 04:36.971
<i>Hi, can I take your order?</i>

04:37.282 --> 04:39.914
Yeah, uh, can I have
a number two with a Coke?

04:39.950 --> 04:41.583
And, um...

04:41.619 --> 04:43.252
Give me just a second,
if you don't mind.

04:43.287 --> 04:44.520
<i>Take your time.</i>

04:44.555 --> 04:46.821
<i>Just hit the silver button
when you're ready.</i>

04:49.860 --> 04:52.494
So if you love this girl so much...

04:52.530 --> 04:54.496
tell me what's so great about her.

04:54.532 --> 04:56.197
You mean beside the fact she's hot

04:56.232 --> 04:57.839
and gets a discount on food?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.167
Yeah, Casanova. Dig deep.

05:01.464 --> 05:04.605
I come here three times a week
and she's always nice.

05:04.641 --> 05:06.207
She's great with people.

05:06.242 --> 05:07.775
Seems smart, you know?

05:07.810 --> 05:09.943
And she's got the best smile
I've ever seen.

05:11.747 --> 05:13.713
He'll have what I'm having.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.782
And, uh, throw your number in
too, if you don't mind.

05:15.817 --> 05:17.350
What?

05:17.386 --> 05:21.132
<i>And that'll be $46.07
at the next window.</i>

05:28.435 --> 05:30.248
Here you go.

05:30.665 --> 05:32.665
Thank you.

05:33.668 --> 05:35.787
Have a nice day.

05:36.204 --> 05:38.036
Asshole. You screwed it up.

05:40.159 --> 05:41.775
See? Trust me.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.709
- What's the hold-up?
- Not bad, Officer Bailey.

05:45.613 --> 05:46.977
Hey, hey, hey.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.680
I don't want to lose
the number. Hold on.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.349
Come on! Ain't got all day!

05:53.886 --> 05:56.821
I give you a lot of shit,
but you're the real deal...

05:57.216 --> 05:59.224
a fuckin' hero in blue.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.426
Thanks.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.672
Wow. This place went to shit.

06:20.411 --> 06:22.244
Where's your daddy?

06:24.048 --> 06:26.382
Above the line. Below the line.

06:26.417 --> 06:28.117
Fuck off.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.923
Try again.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.726
Heart Enterprises called him in.

06:36.761 --> 06:38.526
- Why?
- I don't know.

06:40.063 --> 06:42.997
Jesus!

06:45.569 --> 06:48.140
Twice for lying.

06:53.577 --> 06:55.844
Hey, you dickless piece of shit.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.850
Oh... I thought you were Slink.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.118
You realize you two are like
the same person, right?

07:01.154 --> 07:03.788
I am nothing like that charlatan.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.790
Whatever you have to say to him,

07:05.826 --> 07:07.959
you can say to me.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.794
I'm in charge now.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.463
Every gentleman

07:12.498 --> 07:16.633
gives every person a chance
to learn manners.

07:19.104 --> 07:20.971
As soon as the last race is finished,

07:21.006 --> 07:23.474
there will be a meeting
to discuss a new direction

07:23.509 --> 07:24.808
- for this race.
- Yeah.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.410
They're not gonna listen to you.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.178
They love Slink.

07:28.213 --> 07:30.413
I'm tired of hearing about Slink.

07:30.448 --> 07:35.184
He's gone, and I am
the Master of Mayhem now.

07:37.622 --> 07:39.689
Doesn't look like that to me.

07:39.724 --> 07:41.156
Hey, boss!

07:41.192 --> 07:43.926
Last three racers inbound
from the Savage Land!

07:43.961 --> 07:45.560
Gonna be a close one.

07:52.770 --> 07:56.772
Not that close.

08:13.055 --> 08:15.122
But you can't kill all three!

08:15.157 --> 08:19.359
I can do whatever I want.

08:19.395 --> 08:20.560
I have this.

08:20.595 --> 08:22.295
There's a new sheriff in town,

08:22.330 --> 08:25.565
and he's fucking gorgeous, darling.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.066
Just so we're clear,

08:27.101 --> 08:28.601
you and that cop are the reason

08:28.637 --> 08:30.102
why Slink is on his way out.

08:30.138 --> 08:32.772
Always finding ways to subvert his rules

08:32.808 --> 08:37.142
and go snooping around for
your little bitch of a sister.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.312
Talk about my sister again like that,

08:40.347 --> 08:43.549
and I will rip your
fucking spine out of your neck!

08:43.583 --> 08:46.885
You just didn't learn.

08:46.921 --> 08:48.720
Nothing can hurt as much as losing her,

08:48.756 --> 08:50.722
so you want to keep me in check,

08:50.758 --> 08:52.491
what else you fucking got?

08:52.526 --> 08:54.024
This.

09:00.505 --> 09:02.572
Why isn't this working?

09:02.608 --> 09:03.874
Scholar!

09:04.032 --> 09:05.809
Scholar...

09:05.845 --> 09:07.644
what is wrong with this thing?

09:07.679 --> 09:09.113
Nice try, chump.

09:10.916 --> 09:13.924
You can't blow shit up
inside the party walls.

09:14.085 --> 09:16.119
How does she know that and I don't?

09:18.923 --> 09:21.490
I guess Heart should have
left me in charge.

09:21.525 --> 09:23.392
It worked on her before.

09:23.427 --> 09:25.494
You only shocked her before.

09:25.529 --> 09:27.096
She's right.

09:27.132 --> 09:29.465
They built it for
killing drivers on the race,

09:29.500 --> 09:32.000
- not for during the after party.
- Why?

09:32.091 --> 09:35.070
To stop racers from doing
exactly what you're doing.

09:38.341 --> 09:40.482
Good luck keeping the race
under control.

09:40.507 --> 09:42.271
You're off to a great start.

09:42.296 --> 09:46.814
The moment you set foot outside
these party walls, you're mine.

09:46.849 --> 09:50.985
Break one rule and I will
spread your face like butter

09:51.085 --> 09:55.708
all over the inside
of that awful car you drive.

09:55.733 --> 09:58.392
The Blood Drive is mine!

10:05.333 --> 10:06.800
What are you doing?

10:08.654 --> 10:09.926
I got to go.

10:09.951 --> 10:12.049
I didn't want to leave you
with an empty tank.

10:12.084 --> 10:14.618
I didn't know how to tell you.
I'm sorry.

10:14.643 --> 10:16.563
I got a book full of evidence
against Heart

10:16.598 --> 10:17.797
and nothing tying it all together

10:17.832 --> 10:21.133
except my own testimony, but...

10:21.168 --> 10:22.601
I got to get off this race.

10:22.636 --> 10:24.002
I know you need to keep racing...

10:24.037 --> 10:25.137
Great.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.174
I'm with you.

10:29.210 --> 10:32.344
Karma's gone, so what the hell
am I racing for?

10:32.379 --> 10:34.913
And I've seen more than you,
so let me be your eyewitness.

10:34.948 --> 10:36.215
Are you sure?

10:36.250 --> 10:39.250
Look, you risked your life for
Karma without even knowing her.

10:40.853 --> 10:43.631
Maybe this way, I can repay the favor.

10:44.340 --> 10:47.057
Besides, you were right.

10:48.794 --> 10:50.908
Best way to avenge Karma,

10:51.118 --> 10:52.918
stick it to Heart.

10:55.467 --> 10:57.033
That's the thing about this race.

10:58.703 --> 11:01.167
Distracts you from what's important.

11:01.796 --> 11:04.574
So what do you say? Mind if I tag along?

11:06.645 --> 11:07.942
It's a date.

11:09.588 --> 11:12.366
Now we just got to keep Slink
from blowing our heads up.

11:12.550 --> 11:14.786
Yeah, about that...

11:15.486 --> 11:17.669
Slink's not the problem anymore.

11:19.190 --> 11:21.691
In a single moment in the dead of night,

11:21.925 --> 11:23.824
this country broke in two.

11:23.994 --> 11:26.629
A fissure of death,
a pain-filled gash...

11:26.664 --> 11:29.649
heaven to me, but hell to you.

11:29.805 --> 11:31.772
The Scar.

11:31.901 --> 11:34.802
No scientist could explain it;
no preacher would claim it.

11:34.837 --> 11:37.905
The entire world
simply watched in horror

11:37.940 --> 11:40.975
as a single fracking disaster

11:41.010 --> 11:43.511
tore open open America's heartland.

11:43.547 --> 11:45.513
Humanity fled to the coast,

11:45.549 --> 11:47.147
frightened of all the terrors

11:47.183 --> 11:49.816
the Earth might have stored
in its belly.

11:49.851 --> 11:52.553
A handful of brave souls
ventured into the Scar,

11:52.588 --> 11:56.496
never to return,
never to speak of its wonders.

11:56.793 --> 11:58.492
Oh, but I...

11:58.527 --> 12:01.662
I have peered into its depths.

12:02.270 --> 12:04.669
And I have seen our reward.

12:04.799 --> 12:06.566
The pain of eternity

12:06.601 --> 12:11.536
and the sweet, wet caress of agony.

12:12.039 --> 12:14.840
It's a place no cameras
have ever been before,

12:14.875 --> 12:18.277
until now, and as the Blood Drive

12:18.313 --> 12:20.083
heads straight into The Scar,

12:20.108 --> 12:22.847
bringing our racers face-to-face

12:22.882 --> 12:24.549
with their deepest fears...

12:24.585 --> 12:25.950
God damn it, Slink.

12:25.985 --> 12:27.724
Just let me eat in peace.

12:29.486 --> 12:31.519
But it's... it's a good pitch.

12:31.791 --> 12:33.773
This is my life's work.

12:36.396 --> 12:39.029
<i>Was</i> your life's work.

12:39.064 --> 12:41.532
I'm loving this new look on you.

12:41.567 --> 12:43.734
I think you found your true calling.

12:45.904 --> 12:48.205
You can steal fire from a god,

12:48.241 --> 12:50.207
but he will get his revenge.

12:50.243 --> 12:52.576
And when the race
careens off the tracks,

12:52.612 --> 12:53.910
you'll come begging.

12:53.946 --> 12:55.712
And when you do, sweet meat,

12:55.747 --> 12:59.148
I'll be mopping your guts off the floor.

12:59.183 --> 13:00.049
Oh.

13:00.084 --> 13:02.385
So you'll still be a janitor then.

13:02.420 --> 13:03.786
That's not what I meant.

13:03.821 --> 13:06.055
Someone turn on the race.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.893
What's this?

13:13.364 --> 13:14.730
What is this?

13:17.167 --> 13:18.667
A spin-off?

13:18.702 --> 13:21.436
A crossover episode?

13:21.472 --> 13:25.106
The Gentleman's
our new Master of Ceremonies.

13:25.142 --> 13:27.809
He stole your fire, your thunder,

13:27.844 --> 13:29.477
and your job.

13:29.512 --> 13:31.845
When the show premieres
to the outside world,

13:31.881 --> 13:33.914
he will be the true star.

13:37.887 --> 13:40.688
We're editing you down to a cameo.

13:47.562 --> 13:49.228
Any final notes?

13:50.899 --> 13:53.266
You missed a spot.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.670
Think.

13:59.761 --> 14:01.480
Think, Slink. Think like a god.

14:01.505 --> 14:03.509
<i>Clean-up in cafeteria 7.</i>

14:03.544 --> 14:06.828
Find some rube to do your bidding.

14:06.898 --> 14:08.631
<i>Clean-up in cafeteria 7.</i>

14:26.165 --> 14:28.832
Thank you for coming this evening.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.869
Whether under threat of pain or death

14:31.904 --> 14:33.638
or of your own volition,

14:33.707 --> 14:37.140
it's important that
we spend this time together.

14:37.582 --> 14:40.510
Civilized. Well-mannered.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.712
A community...

14:45.684 --> 14:48.084
God damn it!

14:48.119 --> 14:51.246
Sit right back down this instant!

14:51.860 --> 14:53.626
As I was saying,

14:54.168 --> 14:56.324
certainly, we're all psychos,

14:56.426 --> 14:58.697
sociopaths, and scoundrels,

14:58.728 --> 15:02.759
but that doesn't mean
that we should be uncivilized.

15:02.790 --> 15:03.932
Fuck this!

15:03.968 --> 15:05.934
Listen, if I wanted to be a pussy,

15:05.970 --> 15:07.737
I'd have stayed in Studio City.

15:07.772 --> 15:09.872
Anyone who wants to fuck shit up,

15:09.907 --> 15:11.806
come with...

15:11.908 --> 15:13.708
Oh-ho-ho!

15:15.211 --> 15:17.149
Now...

15:17.447 --> 15:19.947
If there are no further distractions...

15:31.015 --> 15:32.382
Hey, genius.

15:35.464 --> 15:37.130
We just want to talk.

15:37.165 --> 15:39.366
You're the smartest guy
in the camp; we need your help.

15:39.402 --> 15:42.703
We just need you to pop these
little guys out of our heads.

15:42.738 --> 15:44.204
You know, these bombs, they...

15:44.239 --> 15:46.105
Well, th-they're wedged
against our spines,

15:46.144 --> 15:48.488
and they're feeding off
our kinetic energy.

15:48.910 --> 15:50.543
Unless they're powered down,

15:50.667 --> 15:53.462
the instant that we...
we try and take 'em out,

15:53.501 --> 15:55.581
they... they're gonna explode.

15:55.609 --> 15:58.451
I-I'm not smart enough.
I'm not. I'm not smart enough.

15:58.486 --> 16:00.085
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, slugger.

16:00.121 --> 16:01.962
No, no, it's not your fault.

16:02.489 --> 16:03.922
All right, so plan B.

16:03.957 --> 16:06.057
If we have the controller,
he can't hurt us.

16:06.092 --> 16:07.992
So we steal it from this dandy nutsack,

16:08.028 --> 16:10.228
shock him till he drops,
and get the hell out of here.

16:10.263 --> 16:13.197
Okay, and if he sees us
coming, we're screwed.

16:14.968 --> 16:17.302
So then we hide in plain sight.

16:19.004 --> 16:21.060
What are you doing?

16:21.874 --> 16:24.274
How is this gonna distract him?

16:27.046 --> 16:28.809
- Ohhh...
- Ohhh...

16:29.048 --> 16:30.781
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

16:30.817 --> 16:32.650
- No, no.
- Just one finger up his ass.

16:32.685 --> 16:34.251
Grace. No.

16:39.157 --> 16:41.207
Have room for one more...

16:41.563 --> 16:43.253
naughty boy?

16:44.128 --> 16:46.262
Ooh, I think it'll be tight,

16:46.297 --> 16:48.164
but I'm sure I can slip you in.

16:54.444 --> 16:55.938
- Hey, asshole.
- Ah!

16:55.973 --> 16:57.439
Not in the mood today,

16:57.475 --> 16:59.207
peasant, palliard, plebe.

16:59.242 --> 17:00.776
Are you having a stroke?

17:00.811 --> 17:02.678
You think you're so smart, see,

17:02.713 --> 17:04.346
that you got Heart fooled, see?

17:04.381 --> 17:05.814
Your plug 'n' play girlfriend

17:05.849 --> 17:07.816
all wrapped around your dick, see?

17:07.852 --> 17:09.017
But you're wrong.

17:09.051 --> 17:10.451
Are you done?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.760
- Can I kick your ass now?
- You can try.

17:12.856 --> 17:14.471
But first...

17:14.757 --> 17:16.323
we may be able to help each other.

17:16.358 --> 17:19.423
- I'm not helping you.
- Not even with Aki?

17:19.819 --> 17:22.997
Can't tell me she hasn't been
messin' with yo' head.

17:23.031 --> 17:24.499
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:24.534 --> 17:27.000
You think women
are so hard to understand,

17:27.035 --> 17:29.773
but cybergirl's all ones and zeroes.

17:30.038 --> 17:32.305
You just need to crack the code.

17:35.711 --> 17:37.670
Open the door for me...

17:38.013 --> 17:40.701
and I'll help you
tap into her video feed.

17:40.849 --> 17:42.549
She can see through your eye.

17:42.584 --> 17:46.519
Imagine what you'll discover
when you can see through hers.

17:48.422 --> 17:49.822
What door?

18:02.035 --> 18:03.334
That's not a door, that's...

18:08.444 --> 18:10.277
Secret shit.

18:21.219 --> 18:22.519
We shouldn't be here.

18:22.555 --> 18:25.288
Boy, she really did a number on you.

18:25.323 --> 18:28.091
I've seen a lot of
brainwashed idiots in my day,

18:28.126 --> 18:30.293
but you set the world record
for being pussy-whipped.

18:30.328 --> 18:32.195
- I'm not pussy-whipped.
- No, of course not.

18:32.230 --> 18:34.230
It's not even a real pussy.

18:36.302 --> 18:40.469
_

18:47.244 --> 18:49.078
What's behind this door?

18:49.113 --> 18:51.605
One of Heart's mistakes.

18:52.270 --> 18:54.382
Oh, come now.

18:54.417 --> 18:57.533
He's a prisoner, just like you.

18:58.088 --> 18:59.888
Don't you want to be the good guy?

19:24.379 --> 19:25.645
You promised.

19:32.186 --> 19:35.233
Try channel 694.

19:43.230 --> 19:44.763
I'd run if I were you.

19:45.833 --> 19:47.365
This way, little buddy!

19:47.400 --> 19:50.301
This way! Follow the sound of my voice!

19:50.337 --> 19:53.540
This way! Follow me!

20:00.871 --> 20:03.552
So... Los Angeles?
That was a dirty city.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.595
But I'm sure you prettied it up nicely.

20:06.059 --> 20:07.892
Um, yeah.

20:10.770 --> 20:13.353
How are things going
with that partner of yours?

20:13.673 --> 20:16.038
We're... not together.

20:16.085 --> 20:17.317
Oh, come on.

20:17.353 --> 20:18.686
I've seen the way you look at her.

20:18.721 --> 20:21.481
That's not really how I swing.

20:21.524 --> 20:24.157
Really?

20:24.193 --> 20:26.380
I had no idea.

20:26.675 --> 20:28.642
Arthur Bailey.

20:28.763 --> 20:30.730
Mm-hmm.

20:32.433 --> 20:34.045
Mind you, it shouldn't surprise me.

20:34.070 --> 20:36.435
You two have never
really vibed that way.

20:36.471 --> 20:38.237
And from what I hear...

20:38.272 --> 20:40.406
Grace is a hetero home run.

20:40.441 --> 20:43.308
I've heard that too.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.937
I'm so glad...

20:56.223 --> 20:58.608
that you...

20:58.931 --> 21:01.521
opened up to me, Arthur.

21:01.871 --> 21:04.920
It can be so hard sometimes.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.231
Oh, sorry.

21:07.428 --> 21:10.501
I haven't had a chance
to cut my nails lately.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.491
I don't mind at all.

21:12.678 --> 21:15.912
Exactly how stupid...

21:16.041 --> 21:18.952
do you think I am?

21:19.177 --> 21:21.310
Pretty fuckin' stupid.

21:26.184 --> 21:29.208
This is what happens
when you double-cross me.

21:29.387 --> 21:30.854
I might not be able to blow you up,

21:30.889 --> 21:33.341
but let's see what happens
if I fry your brains

21:33.388 --> 21:35.190
for an hour or so.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.492
Who's there?

21:59.661 --> 22:01.794
Show yourself!

22:13.161 --> 22:14.761
Oh, shit.

22:38.419 --> 22:40.778
This is Heart testing me.

22:40.842 --> 22:42.052
I know it.

22:42.091 --> 22:44.714
I need that controller fixed.

22:46.693 --> 22:49.060
Look, I-I...
I don't think I can do this.

22:49.096 --> 22:51.321
Machinery is the one thing
in which you excel.

22:51.407 --> 22:53.531
Twist some screws, cross some wires.

22:53.566 --> 22:55.667
Help me make Arthur and Grace go boom.

22:55.702 --> 22:57.268
Don't you have bigger problems?

22:57.303 --> 22:58.669
Two birds, one stone.

22:58.704 --> 23:00.904
When that ogre pounces
on those two fools,

23:00.940 --> 23:03.273
I'll blow them all to bits.

23:03.308 --> 23:05.585
- Yeah, but...
- What?

23:05.645 --> 23:08.436
Have you fallen for
those two do-gooders?

23:08.781 --> 23:10.614
They saved my life at the diner.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.249
In order to save their own.

23:12.284 --> 23:15.918
At least I'm honest about
what I see in you: your work.

23:15.954 --> 23:17.754
Your inventions fund my lifestyle...

23:17.789 --> 23:19.522
these clothes, this perfect skin.

23:19.557 --> 23:20.890
We both know that.

23:20.925 --> 23:24.493
Now, you should really
be honest with yourself.

23:25.764 --> 23:28.130
What do you have to offer anybody,

23:28.299 --> 23:30.432
besides your tinkering?

23:30.468 --> 23:32.349
You're repulsive.

23:32.502 --> 23:35.771
Those two are fools who do not
know their own potential.

23:35.806 --> 23:38.573
I do not have that problem.

23:39.141 --> 23:41.258
Now, you can help me

23:41.478 --> 23:43.946
and share in my spoils,

23:44.281 --> 23:47.204
or you can be alone.

24:03.933 --> 24:06.251
689...

24:06.316 --> 24:09.040
690... 691...

24:12.607 --> 24:14.343
692...

24:14.897 --> 24:16.787
693...

24:16.853 --> 24:18.152
694.

24:18.177 --> 24:19.410
<i>Oh, God.</i>

24:19.566 --> 24:20.932
Sergeant Gower?

24:20.957 --> 24:22.322
<i>Sweet God.</i>

24:22.439 --> 24:24.739
<i>There is no God, Sergeant Gower.</i>

24:24.806 --> 24:26.604
<i>Then hail Satan, bitch.</i>

24:26.687 --> 24:29.317
<i>Just keep doing what you're doing.</i>

24:29.690 --> 24:31.356
<i>What about this?</i>

24:31.391 --> 24:33.341
<i>No!</i>

24:37.198 --> 24:41.848
<i>The only thing I like better
than banging you</i>

24:42.353 --> 24:44.887
<i>is watching you seduce
that idiot Christopher.</i>

24:45.972 --> 24:48.172
<i>He's got no clue.</i>

24:48.208 --> 24:50.474
<i>And I think he might really love you.</i>

24:50.509 --> 24:52.343
<i>I don't understand.</i>

24:52.388 --> 24:54.455
<i>Of course you don't.</i>

24:54.641 --> 24:56.380
<i>It's a human thing.</i>

24:56.672 --> 25:00.383
<i>You're just a toaster
with a vibrating...</i>

25:09.144 --> 25:10.577
Okay, so...

25:10.613 --> 25:12.488
assuming that we actually get past

25:12.519 --> 25:13.883
the rampaging giant out there

25:13.941 --> 25:15.407
and steal the controller

25:15.442 --> 25:17.510
and ditch the Mayhem Party, then what?

25:17.545 --> 25:19.467
We're in the middle of a wasteland.

25:19.492 --> 25:21.025
We have to make it to a major city,

25:21.060 --> 25:23.726
and New York's on the other side
of The Scar, so...

25:24.029 --> 25:25.528
we go back to LA?

25:25.563 --> 25:28.297
It's a trek, but it's our best shot
at taking down Heart.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.199
Plus, I have a connection with the DA.

25:30.235 --> 25:31.567
Oh. The DA.

25:31.603 --> 25:33.369
Yeah, I can't wait to see their face

25:33.404 --> 25:36.001
when we tell them about
the 8-foot ogre out there.

25:36.033 --> 25:37.533
And then what, Arthur?

25:37.561 --> 25:39.994
What the hell are we gonna do
with ourselves then?

25:40.329 --> 25:42.629
I know what I'm doing.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.669
Nothing.

25:45.075 --> 25:48.825
No more fighting, no more missions...

25:48.979 --> 25:50.864
no more killing.

25:51.414 --> 25:52.981
Yeah, good luck with that.

26:00.923 --> 26:03.075
Miss me?

26:07.262 --> 26:09.663
Where's the controller, dipshit?

26:09.932 --> 26:11.945
I came to make a deal.

26:12.234 --> 26:14.367
Hard as it is for me
to say this out loud,

26:14.392 --> 26:16.556
you two are the best fighters we have.

26:16.628 --> 26:18.970
Kill that giant for me,

26:19.017 --> 26:20.740
and I'll let you both go free.

26:20.775 --> 26:22.742
You hear that, Grace?

26:22.777 --> 26:24.921
- He's gonna let us walk free.
- Yeah, just like that.

26:24.946 --> 26:27.179
- Just like that.
- We don't trust you.

26:27.215 --> 26:29.985
Hmm. On an average day,

26:30.919 --> 26:32.417
maybe not.

26:35.122 --> 26:37.222
But I have a race to get back on track,

26:37.324 --> 26:40.074
and you two are a thorn in my side.

26:41.156 --> 26:42.723
Kill that giant.

26:43.063 --> 26:45.321
It's a win-win situation.

26:45.633 --> 26:47.966
You both wander off in the chaos.

26:58.778 --> 27:00.611
I broke a nail.

27:03.149 --> 27:04.715
What was his name?

27:04.751 --> 27:07.216
Uh, Nick Zigler, sir.

27:07.252 --> 27:09.166
That name sounds made up.

27:09.254 --> 27:12.447
Well, he shouldn't
have opened his mouth.

27:12.791 --> 27:16.153
Find out who the hell that is.

27:16.585 --> 27:18.755
We have a theory, sir.

27:20.498 --> 27:21.998
_

27:22.034 --> 27:23.999
- Are you running?
- Yeah.

27:24.035 --> 27:28.141
So this is test subject number 39462,

27:28.172 --> 27:30.105
one Mr. Denali.

27:30.140 --> 27:31.840
Thank you for volunteering.

27:31.876 --> 27:33.842
Now, I've managed to stabilize

27:33.961 --> 27:36.891
every single one of my serums

27:37.214 --> 27:38.914
into a single compound...

27:38.950 --> 27:41.282
the negative side effects of Smax,

27:41.317 --> 27:43.818
the brain-altering aspects

27:43.853 --> 27:45.152
of Red rapture.

27:45.188 --> 27:46.821
What I'm holding here

27:46.856 --> 27:48.690
is either more powerful,

27:48.725 --> 27:51.292
more important to humanity,

27:51.327 --> 27:54.862
more shockingly destructive
than the atomic bomb,

27:54.898 --> 27:59.332
or it's just a bunch of shit
mixed together.

27:59.367 --> 28:02.502
Either way, I am unable to test it

28:02.537 --> 28:04.504
until I have more lab results...

28:05.908 --> 28:06.873
Oy!

28:06.909 --> 28:09.693
Cut that. Cut. Cut, cut, cut!

28:10.662 --> 28:12.345
He never should have gotten out.

28:12.380 --> 28:14.113
God, this is terrible.

28:14.148 --> 28:16.281
But I thought you wanted more carnage.

28:16.317 --> 28:17.984
You should be loving this.

28:18.019 --> 28:20.352
That freak killed half the racers.

28:20.387 --> 28:23.222
How can I test engines without a race?

28:23.257 --> 28:25.024
This is your fault!

28:25.059 --> 28:26.492
I know it.

28:26.527 --> 28:27.559
Me?

28:27.595 --> 28:30.162
But I've been held captive
here at Heart Tower

28:30.197 --> 28:32.230
like a damsel in distress.

28:32.265 --> 28:34.699
How could it possibly be my fault?

28:44.410 --> 28:46.410
That's the cop's old partner.

28:46.446 --> 28:47.978
What's he doing here?

28:48.014 --> 28:50.681
You'd have to ask the Aki unit
in charge of him.

28:50.716 --> 28:54.151
The point is, nothing escapes me.

28:54.186 --> 28:56.586
But something has escaped you.

28:56.622 --> 28:59.322
Where's your gentleman now, hmm?

28:59.358 --> 29:02.549
Why isn't he fighting that thing?

29:02.928 --> 29:06.562
If I were there, that giant
would be a smear on the ground,

29:06.597 --> 29:10.599
and we'd all be dancing on its bones.

29:10.635 --> 29:12.168
Fine.

29:12.203 --> 29:14.537
You have one more chance.

29:14.572 --> 29:16.873
Get the race back on track,
or you'll be terminated,

29:16.908 --> 29:18.507
contract or not.

29:18.543 --> 29:20.441
I'm sorry, I'm not used to hearing

29:20.488 --> 29:22.610
the sound of your desperation.

29:22.646 --> 29:24.880
Could you whisper it to me slowly?

29:36.727 --> 29:38.926
Tell me about him.

29:51.273 --> 29:52.773
- Did I hurt him?
- No!

30:15.662 --> 30:17.096
Hey, fat fuck.

30:20.434 --> 30:23.401
How'd you know I was talking to you?

30:23.683 --> 30:26.229
I'm kind of tired of fighting.

30:26.666 --> 30:28.032
I'll make you a deal.

30:28.097 --> 30:31.109
Just come squash me
and put me out of my misery.

30:48.335 --> 30:50.035
Good job, Barbie.

30:50.195 --> 30:52.162
You too.

31:02.407 --> 31:04.339
Oh, shit.

31:12.278 --> 31:14.434
Hello, Christopher.

31:14.918 --> 31:16.680
Care to join us?

31:16.715 --> 31:18.898
This is my room.

31:19.433 --> 31:20.900
You can watch, but...

31:21.053 --> 31:22.987
you have to get naked.

31:23.022 --> 31:25.589
What the hell
are you doing here, Sergeant?

31:25.624 --> 31:27.758
You can't trust her. They brainwash you.

31:27.794 --> 31:29.859
That's how they control their prisoners.

31:29.895 --> 31:31.327
I'm not a prisoner.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.865
Why do I feel this way?

31:35.901 --> 31:37.600
What have you done to me?

31:37.635 --> 31:39.543
Think about it, Officer.

31:39.596 --> 31:41.296
She's not human.

31:41.472 --> 31:43.762
She's a sex toy.

31:44.242 --> 31:46.108
I'm the one that did this to you.

31:46.143 --> 31:47.942
What?

31:48.212 --> 31:49.878
You're a fucking cop!

31:49.914 --> 31:51.880
We were never cops.

31:51.916 --> 31:54.523
Christ, you're just as dense
as your partner...

31:54.625 --> 31:57.125
trying to figure out the maze
and running into walls.

31:57.387 --> 32:00.522
You always worked for Heart.

32:00.557 --> 32:02.657
Every arm you broke,

32:02.693 --> 32:05.605
every jaw you busted
was all part of their plan.

32:06.113 --> 32:10.246
All the violence in the street
was designed to create chaos.

32:10.399 --> 32:12.633
We blurred the line
between cop and criminal

32:12.668 --> 32:15.319
until no one knew
who the good guys were.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.890
And then you got too close to the truth.

32:18.063 --> 32:21.530
So we led you to the race.

32:22.010 --> 32:23.632
I'm the reason you're here.

32:23.778 --> 32:26.648
I'm the reason why Arthur
has a bomb in his head.

32:26.821 --> 32:30.741
You failed, you pathetic piece of shit.

32:30.853 --> 32:33.653
No wonder robo-slut wants
to screw me more than you...

32:36.844 --> 32:39.399
You shouldn't have done that.

32:39.727 --> 32:41.160
According to my algorithms,

32:41.195 --> 32:44.029
you have weeks of
behavioral modifications left

32:44.065 --> 32:46.034
before you are capable of murder.

32:46.367 --> 32:49.401
I guess love doesn't obey algorithms.

32:49.436 --> 32:50.870
Love?

32:59.445 --> 33:01.828
All security restraints
have been lifted.

33:01.941 --> 33:04.041
You are free to go anytime.

33:14.159 --> 33:16.059
Let's go, bitch.

33:18.629 --> 33:20.063
You're not done yet?

33:20.099 --> 33:21.631
This is the perfect time.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.867
I could kill them all with one click,

33:23.903 --> 33:25.936
but, no, you can't perform.

33:25.971 --> 33:28.318
Shut up! Shut up!

33:28.343 --> 33:30.599
You can't rush genius.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.576
Gutter rats like you astound me.

33:34.612 --> 33:37.079
You've forgotten what you are...

33:37.115 --> 33:41.717
a puny, useless genetic mistake
with only one function.

33:41.752 --> 33:43.319
If you can't fix that controller,

33:43.354 --> 33:45.887
then what's your value to anyone?

34:00.938 --> 34:02.303
I'm so sick...

34:02.338 --> 34:04.052
of these freaks...

34:04.206 --> 34:05.806
giving us hell.

34:11.013 --> 34:12.904
Watch out!

34:13.895 --> 34:15.460
Oh, fuck.

34:22.123 --> 34:23.456
Arthur?

34:25.793 --> 34:27.092
Oh, thank God.

34:27.128 --> 34:28.793
Did I get him?

34:46.746 --> 34:48.013
Scholar, pop the hood!

35:26.256 --> 35:28.647
Daddy's home!

35:32.562 --> 35:35.569
You've all been very naughty!

35:36.247 --> 35:38.981
So much work to do. Rasher?

35:39.052 --> 35:40.668
Hey, boss.

35:46.847 --> 35:49.181
No, no...

35:49.216 --> 35:50.716
No!

35:52.019 --> 35:54.219
No!

35:55.523 --> 35:57.221
No!

35:58.692 --> 36:00.458
No!

36:00.493 --> 36:02.259
No, no...

36:02.295 --> 36:04.429
They fired you!

36:04.898 --> 36:07.430
The race is mine!

36:08.034 --> 36:10.134
Oh, please.

36:11.538 --> 36:13.670
You can't out-dandy me.

36:16.709 --> 36:18.908
There's a reason you failed.
Care to hear it?

36:21.347 --> 36:23.814
What I do is an art form.

36:25.718 --> 36:27.790
It takes skill to orchestrate scenarios.

36:27.815 --> 36:29.820
Months of planning. Years.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.699
I've been a hundred steps
ahead of everyone

36:33.724 --> 36:35.023
for this entire race.

36:35.059 --> 36:36.659
What makes you think you can beat me?

36:39.055 --> 36:42.427
The business card you found
in The Scholar's mechanic shop,

36:42.474 --> 36:44.201
I'm the one who slipped it
into your man-purse.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.842
And Domi's marriage counselor
didn't recommend a death race

36:51.877 --> 36:53.681
without a little outside influence.

36:53.706 --> 36:56.626
And did you really think
a girl as headstrong as Grace

36:56.659 --> 36:59.073
could be recruited of her own free will?

37:01.193 --> 37:02.492
I had to drug her sister

37:02.543 --> 37:04.143
and drive her half bat-shit crazy

37:04.179 --> 37:06.144
before she'd sign up for this.

37:07.957 --> 37:11.992
Everyone has had their fate guided,

37:12.192 --> 37:14.648
directly controlled,

37:15.217 --> 37:17.266
by me.

37:17.524 --> 37:20.158
What makes you think a pansy like you

37:20.194 --> 37:23.009
could just step in and take it over?

37:28.201 --> 37:31.522
You love this race so much?

37:31.920 --> 37:36.089
I'll kill every racer you have.

37:36.242 --> 37:38.175
If I can't be in charge,

37:38.211 --> 37:40.109
no one can!

37:40.145 --> 37:42.025
That's against the rules...

37:42.104 --> 37:45.189
and certainly
not very gentlemanly of you.

37:45.616 --> 37:47.549
Fuck the rules.

37:47.593 --> 37:49.693
Fuck you!

37:49.761 --> 37:52.427
The work I put into this race...

37:52.557 --> 37:55.358
the things I've let that freak do

37:55.393 --> 37:57.726
to my beautiful penis

37:57.761 --> 37:59.694
just to keep winning!

38:01.769 --> 38:03.435
Good...

38:03.533 --> 38:04.366
Riddance.

38:48.809 --> 38:50.109
Clean it up.

39:03.557 --> 39:06.933
By all means, keep walking.

39:10.863 --> 39:12.496
You're gonna die.

39:12.590 --> 39:14.316
Grace...

39:14.430 --> 39:16.063
stop.

39:16.342 --> 39:17.508
So dull.

39:17.543 --> 39:20.677
So two episodes ago.

39:26.118 --> 39:28.585
My God, you're a stubborn bitch.

39:51.743 --> 39:53.515
Relax.

39:53.616 --> 39:55.281
She'll live.

39:55.411 --> 39:59.084
Put her in the car and get your ass
back out onto the road.

39:59.215 --> 40:01.717
Rasher will send coordinates.

40:02.052 --> 40:04.052
Or do you want to test the limits

40:04.087 --> 40:08.222
of a <i> real</i> Master of Mayhem?

40:21.904 --> 40:23.774
I'll drive for a while.

40:24.079 --> 40:26.140
You try and dream of better days.

40:34.006 --> 40:36.577
There are things I've done...

40:37.218 --> 40:39.451
- You know, things I did for him...
- Hey.

40:41.723 --> 40:43.578
You want a ride?

40:44.425 --> 40:46.141
Yeah.

40:46.526 --> 40:48.326
Come on.

41:03.511 --> 41:05.175
Apologize...

41:05.302 --> 41:07.730
for helping that traitor.

41:08.715 --> 41:10.380
No.

41:21.259 --> 41:24.293
Change the coordinates
for Arthur and Grace.

41:24.371 --> 41:26.295
Take them through Red River.

41:26.371 --> 41:28.765
That brings them to
the edge of The Scar.

41:28.800 --> 41:31.634
I thought we weren't
supposed to kill Grace.

41:35.473 --> 41:39.120
What Heart doesn't know won't hurt us.

41:49.319 --> 41:52.502
I'm tired of your disrespect.

41:52.794 --> 41:56.303
<i>So from now on,
the Blood Drive will continue</i>

41:56.365 --> 41:58.967
<i>as I see fit.</i>
