CAROL: We'll be down there.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.369
CHIP: Yup.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.505
AGNES: We're planning to go
on a little hunt boating trip,
our very first one this season

01:13.541 --> 01:15.274
now that the ice is gone.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.076
CHIP: These rivers
here, they're our roads.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.644
So now, it's time
to travel this road.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.346
But do it in a boat rather
than the snow machines.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.816
You guys ready?

01:23.851 --> 01:27.586
CAROL: Sure.
AGNES: Ready and willing.
CHIP: Let's go.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.395
CAROL: Right there!

01:36.430 --> 01:37.729
AGNES: Oh, it's
right there, Chip.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.931
Stop.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.332
CHIP: Oh, wow.
That's our target.

01:40.367 --> 01:43.135
AGNES: There's a
muskrat, Carol, you're
the first shooter.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.141
CHIP: Good job, Carol.

01:49.176 --> 01:51.410
AGNES: Man, hook, hook, Qutan.

01:51.512 --> 01:55.781
CHIP: Good one, there you go.
AGNES: Our first muskrat.
CHIP: All right, good job.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.600
This is the last fur
hunt of the year.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.253
The animals that live
in the water, they don't
shed till next month.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.755
So, their fur
is really, really good
still prime right now.

02:03.791 --> 02:04.957
And they're pretty
good-tasting.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.692
And we can use their furs
for making stuff out of.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.210
You can make blankets.
You can make clothing.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.028
It comes down to,
you know, feeding your
kids, feeding yourself.

02:10.064 --> 02:12.397
None of it goes to waste.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.066
AGNES: 12:00. You see it?

02:14.101 --> 02:15.767
CHIP: I see it.
CAROL: There's another one.
QUTAN: Right there, dad.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.136
AGNES: It's right
there Chip, stop.
Right there, Carol.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.804
CHIP: That's him underneath
there underneath the log.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.172
He's right underneath
the log right there.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.573
Right in front of us.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.941
AGNES: It's right
in here, Carol.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.109
QUTAN: It's just right there.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.377
AGNES: Grab it, Qutan.
You got it.

02:25.412 --> 02:26.678
CHIP: Just grab
it by its tail.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.747
QUTAN: I can't reach it.
AGNES: Here you are.
CHIP: There you go.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.616
AGNES: Perfect, Carol,
perfect, you're doing great.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.851
CHIP: Now grab it and
bring it in, be quick!

02:32.887 --> 02:35.854
AGNES: We got a
shooter and a grabber.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.023
CHIP: We haven't even gotten
a mile down this channel yet,

02:38.042 --> 02:39.591
and we're doing pretty good.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.793
AGNES: There it is, Carol.
QUTAN: Right there!
AGNES: One, two, three, go.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.363
CHIP: You're a little high.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.965
You need to bring that front
side down a little bit.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.568
AGNES: Go, Carol.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.272
Yee! You got it.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.007
CHIP: Carol's getting
used to using a .22,

02:55.042 --> 02:57.976
and she's in a boat
doing this while the
muskrat's doing this.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.878
So, when you're doing
this, it's not easy.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.713
Not easy at all.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.081
AGNES: Way up there.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.017
12:00.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.586
CHIP: You lead it too much.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.389
AGNES: Reload.
One more time, get it ready.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.724
By the fifth muskrat,
you'll be just dialed in.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.893
CHIP: Good job, Carol.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.078
AGNES: That's a big one.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.229
CHIP: Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.396
Right here, right here.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.200
AGNES: Whoa.
It's coming right to you.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.969
QUTAN: That one is dead!
AGNES: Nice shot!
MARY: Wonderful!

03:24.004 --> 03:25.504
QUTAN: You got it!
CHIP: There you go.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.838
AGNES: You girls are awesome.
I love this.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.274
Now I know how my
parents used to feel.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.444
So exciting, fun.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.415
CHIP: Now you're learning
that rifle a bit, aren't you?

03:36.450 --> 03:37.783
CAROL: We got eight.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.985
CHIP: Whoa.
There's number nine.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.456
Good job.

03:44.491 --> 03:47.693
We haven't even made it
a mile down this channel yet,
and we're getting plenty.

03:47.962 --> 03:49.928
I think we're gonna do
pretty good tonight.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.497
We just got a long
night ahead of us.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.502
MARTHA MAE: As far as
waste goes, I guess that
comes full circle with

03:57.538 --> 03:59.304
everything that we have.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.306
Whatever we can use,
we'll utilize it...

04:01.325 --> 04:03.508
So nothing goes to waste.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.223
ERIK: There we go.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.791
We're gonna cut up
this moose quarter.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.628
It's the last one that
we have from the moose we
harvested this past fall.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.664
It's a ham, really
tasty, prime cut piece.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.933
I'll hack the
bone out of here.

04:27.952 --> 04:31.203
Start taking apart
the muscle groups.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.942
<i> NARRATOR: Erik and</i>
<i> Martha Salitan rely on</i>
<i> the animals they hunt,</i>

04:36.977 --> 04:39.678
<i> to maintain a subsistence</i>
<i> lifestyle in the arctic.</i>

04:42.016 --> 04:44.750
ERIK: Oh, you wanna scrap
together a smoker and
smoke some of this meat?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.286
MARTHA MAE: Yeah, that
could be fun, different.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.655
ERIK: Break up the
cuisine a little bit?

04:49.690 --> 04:51.890
MARTHA MAE: Uh-hmm.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.693
Harvesting your own meat,
it's very fulfilling.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.929
You feel a lot better
knowing that you
butchered the animal,

04:58.499 --> 04:59.998
it's all good quality meat,

05:00.034 --> 05:02.567
and it makes you feel a
little bit more independent,
living in the bush.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.037
ERIK: Well, I'm done.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.039
Let's go out and check
out what we got for
building materials.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.640
MARTHA MAE: Sounds good.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.642
I'm done, too.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.316
ERIK: The type of smoker
that we're looking to
make is a cold smoker.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.918
It just adds a little
bit more flavor.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.620
It doesn't add any
nutritional value.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.723
It has nothing to do with
life or death, it's just
a little spice of life.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.193
MARTHA MAE: Doing these
small kind of projects is fun
because it's like a change of

05:28.228 --> 05:31.129
pace, something different
than the daily chores.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.299
ERIK: I'm gonna use these
two by sixes that are left
over from building this

05:34.335 --> 05:36.301
hangar this past summer.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.171
We're gonna go six feet
deep, six feet wide, and put
a six-foot roof on there.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.208
MARTHA MAE: We're putting
up the sheet metal here,
which is not only going to

05:43.243 --> 05:45.744
complete the smokehouse, but
make it sturdier.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.181
ERIK: Feed it up
on the top there.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.083
MARTHA MAE: So far,
progress has been real fast.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.085
We have four walls, we've
got the roofs all ready.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.454
We've pounded it out and
we're just gonna keep moving.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.223
Is it gonna fit?

05:59.159 --> 06:02.361
ERIK: We're gonna get this
door on hinges, make sure
it flows the way we want it.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.229
Then we'll sheet
the son of a gun.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.732
MARTHA MAE: It's nice
to be able to work on our
own little projects at

06:06.767 --> 06:10.402
our own pace and
do what we wanna do.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.110
Nice.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.244
ERIK: And it's solid.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.846
MARTHA MAE: Yeah.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.849
ERIK: And the first moose
we smoke in there is the
moose that antlers it is.

06:23.884 --> 06:28.186
I'm just pumped to drag
it out of here and fire
it up for the first time.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.190
CHIP: There's only so much
you can talk about to your
kids and there's only so many

06:32.226 --> 06:33.892
stories that they can
read and see and hear.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.428
The best you can do is just
take them out there with you.

06:45.439 --> 06:48.473
AGNES: It's about to come up
right in front of you, Carol.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.308
Yee!

06:50.344 --> 06:52.944
CHIP: Good one.
AGNES: Good shot.
CAROL: This is fun.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.747

theres one right there!

07:09.229 --> 07:10.695
MARY: Right there.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.297
QUTAN: Hey, can
I try to shoot?

07:12.332 --> 07:15.400
AGNES: Carol, pass the gun
to Qutan, let Qutan shoot it.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.635
CAROL: Here Qutan,
you can see it?

07:16.670 --> 07:17.936
QUTAN: What? I don't,
I can't see it.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.671
CAROL: Point at it, Qutan.
You can see it.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.523
QUTAN: Okay.
AGNES: Right there.
CAROL: Use your sight.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.811
Even it out. You got it.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.646
AGNES: She got it.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.880
CAROL: Good job, Qutan.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.048
CHIP: Good job, Qutan.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.349
I'm glad you got a muskrat.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.452
Now, get a hundred more.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.520
QUTAN: It's gonna pop up.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.789
CAROL: Oh!

07:37.825 --> 07:39.591
AGNES: Qutan got
her second one.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.692
So exciting!

07:40.760 --> 07:42.527
AGNES: We're doing a
real good hunt here.

07:42.563 --> 07:46.631
And this is usually
how we teach our children
and pretty soon I won't have

07:46.667 --> 07:48.533
to do any shooting anymore.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.604
CAROL: Look, right there.
Good shot!

07:52.606 --> 07:54.139
MARY: You got it!

07:54.174 --> 07:56.975
AGNES: Oh, my god, Qutan!
I can't believe your
proficient shot.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.481
AGNES: Okay, Mary, you're up.

08:02.566 --> 08:06.351
CAROL: You see it, Mary?
It's right there.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.356
CHIP: You should try aiming
at the middle of his neck.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.693
CAROL: Almost.

08:16.497 --> 08:17.729
QUTAN: It's in the same spot.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.264
As the (inaudible).

08:19.299 --> 08:21.433
AGNES: Go ahead.
CHIP: Good.

08:21.768 --> 08:26.271
AGNES: Oh! Deader than dead.
CHIP: Good job, Mary.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.609
Takes a lot of getting
used to shooting in a
moving boat, doesn't it?

08:30.644 --> 08:33.111
It's not easy when you're
sitting here doing this
with your rifle, is it?

08:33.647 --> 08:36.615
Anybody who says this is
an easy hunt is foolish.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.650
It's getting a little
too windy here, girls.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.151
It's about time
to call it a day.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.253
Sound good?

08:41.288 --> 08:44.222
AGNES: Yup, besides our,
um, muskrat tote is full.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.790
CHIP: And to think,

08:45.826 --> 08:47.893
we didn't even burn five gallons
of gas getting all this.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.261
AGNES: And I didn't
even have to shoot.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.695
You girls did a
real awesome job.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.732
CHIP: Yup, and
that was the best.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.204
ERIK: Every day, I work.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.407
You know, out cutting
some firewood, out
hunting, trapping...

09:02.776 --> 09:05.544
Whatever it is, I'm into
being productive every day.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.557
MARTHA MAE: You ran into me.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.928
<i> NARRATOR: Erik and</i>
<i> Martha have built a smoker</i>
<i> to prepare meat that</i>

09:22.963 --> 09:25.430
<i> they harvested themselves.</i>

09:25.766 --> 09:28.733
<i> But before it can be</i>
<i> used, it must be moved</i>
<i> out of the hangar.</i>

09:30.637 --> 09:32.304
MARTHA MAE: Your snow
machine's gonna be able
to pull this thing?

09:32.339 --> 09:33.572
ERIK: I am not sure.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.839
Try with a snow machine.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.375
If not, we'll just hook
the truck up to it.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.180
MARTHA MAE: So we got
the tow hitch attached.

09:42.215 --> 09:46.051
We're gonna see if
we can get the smoker
out of the hangar now.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.428
ERIK: All right.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.101
MARTHA MAE: No, it's
not gonna happen.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.039
ERIK: We tried to pull
the smokehouse out
with the snow machine.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.276
I think we can probably get
it if we kept reefing on it,
but it's not worth damaging

10:11.311 --> 10:13.111
a snow machine over it.

10:14.114 --> 10:18.717
So I'm just gonna pull my
truck around, hook onto
it, and drag it on out.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.621
MARTHA MAE: That's good!

10:22.656 --> 10:26.992
Start off slow so we
can get the line taut.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.394
A little bit more.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.396
Okay!

10:31.431 --> 10:33.365
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

10:40.374 --> 10:44.676
Okay, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

10:50.417 --> 10:52.617
I knew it was
gonna hit that lip!

10:52.653 --> 10:54.552
It hit that lip and
busted the skid off.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.124
We just tried pulling the
smokehouse out, unfortunately,
we didn't have the skids

10:59.159 --> 11:03.495
braced well, so they came
together and in turn, pulled
the whole frame of the

11:03.530 --> 11:06.264
smokehouse in also.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.032
So a little bit of a bummer.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.536
ERIK: The chain choked the
two pieces together because
there was no crosspiece here.

11:12.739 --> 11:16.141
Kind of irritated at myself
for rushing, not putting
a good support on it.

11:18.545 --> 11:22.614
MARTHA MAE: Gonna take this
two by six and make the skids
a little bit sturdier by

11:22.649 --> 11:26.418
putting it in between, so next
time when we pull, at least
they won't come together.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.820
ERIK: Stand on this,
will you, Martha?

11:32.259 --> 11:35.360
Now we got the bracing on
there, I'm gonna go ahead
and hook it onto my truck.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.129
And hopefully, it should
be secure and we'll go
ahead and we'll be able to

11:38.165 --> 11:41.199
pull it across the yard
where we want it.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.277
MARTHA MAE: Just moved
the smokehouse to where it's
gonna sit temporarily and

11:52.312 --> 11:54.946
get it smoking.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.023
ERIK: I'm gonna put this
little wood stove in
there and fire her up.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.463
MARTHA MAE: So now Erik's
sticking the alder in there.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.300
ERIK: Alder is a
highly desirable wood
to use for a smoker.

12:15.602 --> 12:19.871
A nice flavor that comes
off of it that will be
impregnated into the meat.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.907
There she goes.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.643
MARTHA MAE: Close the
doors and let it smoke.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.850
CHIP: With every change of
weather, with every change
of season, you know,

12:31.885 --> 12:33.151
even the moon.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.687
There's always some
new opportunity.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.163
AGNES: Now this is
where the work begins.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.399
So what we do first is
we go around the legs.

12:48.802 --> 12:51.870

13:01.715 --> 13:06.284
AGNES: You can tell where
the back, it's dark and where
the stomach part, the light,

13:07.154 --> 13:09.587
comes together right
here between that.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.991
Like in the tail you,
take your knife and
you follow that line.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.492
And you go straight down.

13:14.528 --> 13:15.960
You go to the tail.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.762
Yup, just like that.

13:17.798 --> 13:21.499
And that's where we'll
start to peel from.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.737
I done a lot of these when
I was your girls' age.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.273
I feel like this has been
a real successful hunt.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.676
We got quite the collection
of muskrats and pretty
soon we'll have quite the

13:31.711 --> 13:34.078
collection of muskrat skins.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.348
So once you really figure
it out, it should take you
less than ten minutes to

13:37.384 --> 13:39.083
do one muskrat.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.887
We got 57 to do, so if we
work together, we should
get them done fairly soon.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.429
CHIP: You guys wanna
eat some muskrat?

13:51.464 --> 13:53.498
I got some with some rice.

AGNES: Muskrat, you say?

13:54.901 --> 13:56.267
CHIP: 'Skrat and rice.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.136
AGNES: Right on.
Awesome, thank you.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.638
Wow.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.774
Qutan, you ever
try muskrat before?

14:03.944 --> 14:05.143
It's pretty good.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.778
Muskrats have its own flavor.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.746
CHIP: Well, these girls
know from beginning to end
just what it takes to get

14:08.782 --> 14:10.215
everything working.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.416
The girls all
learned something.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.252
They all took their turns.
They had their fun.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.355
The best thing to do is
just sit back and watch
your kids succeed.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.457
I really like doing that.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.693
People here a couple
hundred years ago were
tasting the same stuff at

14:21.728 --> 14:23.027
this time of year.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.230
Kind of like having
hotdogs on the 4th of July.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.765
AGNES: Well, muskrat is
the flavor of the season.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.901
CHIP: Yeah, it is.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.021
ERIK: Day in and day out,

14:33.073 --> 14:34.739
I wanna be out in the
woods, I want to be hunting,

14:34.774 --> 14:38.009
I want to be trapping,
I want to be flying,
I want to be fishing.

14:38.445 --> 14:42.280
That's why I run off and
come live out in the woods.

14:48.588 --> 14:52.791

dinner for Erik and I.od pr

15:08.275 --> 15:10.876
Looking good in here.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.978
I think I'm gonna go
with this one right here.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.314
Right on the top shelf.

15:15.349 --> 15:18.984
Took this one off the top
shelf, so I guess it's what
you would call top shelf meat.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.987
Nice.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.456
Gonna go cook it up.

15:27.328 --> 15:30.062
Smoker was a good little
project for Erik and I.

15:31.399 --> 15:34.900
That was a little bit of
a challenge there at the
end when it came apart,

15:35.569 --> 15:40.172
but Erik and I
always overcome whatever
issues we have out here,

15:40.741 --> 15:42.274
which you gotta do anyway.

15:42.309 --> 15:46.078
You can't rely on anybody
else but yourselves, so
you work independently.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.180
It's really cool to think
that not too long ago,

15:48.215 --> 15:50.349
Erik and I were brainstorming
up this idea about this

15:50.384 --> 15:52.918
whole smokehouse,
and build the smoker,

15:53.687 --> 15:56.288
and then smell the
fruits of our labor.

15:56.524 --> 15:58.757
ERIK: Real good.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.797
CHIP: Preparedness
meets opportunity
gives you good luck.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.331
That's really how it works.

16:06.367 --> 16:09.268
All the possibilities
out here are open to us.

16:13.841 --> 16:16.175
Once we get the boat
out and we get everything
all packed inside the

16:16.210 --> 16:18.977
boat good and proper,
it's off to Kookoochiaq.

16:19.313 --> 16:22.147
We're going down to
Kookoochiaq to go stay, but
we're going to be at a lower

16:22.183 --> 16:24.016
camp they call Nuluk.

16:25.686 --> 16:28.487
While we're down there,
we're gonna go fishing and
gather some firewood and do

16:28.522 --> 16:31.990
all the other things that
you do while you're camping,
so it should be a lot of fun.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.828

pipes to fix the stove
when we get there.

16:35.863 --> 16:37.830
CHIP: There's that
little cabin there.

16:37.865 --> 16:39.498
My wife built it
when she was 17.

16:39.533 --> 16:41.400
She has a lot of pride
in that little cabin.

16:41.435 --> 16:44.770
This last winter, there
was a tree that fell on
it and then in the wind,

16:44.805 --> 16:46.371
it sit there and
swiped back and forth.

16:46.407 --> 16:50.075
It damaged the stove pipe.
It needs to be fixed.
That's all there is to it.

16:50.411 --> 16:52.544

life is once you've got
a cabin or something,

16:52.580 --> 16:54.446
you take care of it.

16:54.782 --> 16:57.015

We've got gas.
We've got everything in order.

much have everything.

21:28.939 --> 21:32.090
And I brought pipe here
to replace this with.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.527
I'm gonna get Carol up on
top of the roof and let her
take it apart from up there.

21:35.562 --> 21:38.396
I'm going to try and send
her up another piece of pipe.

21:42.603 --> 21:45.237
CAROL: Oh, my leg
couldn't reach.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.473
AGNES: Careful.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.883
CHIP: Let's try and
see if this will fit.

22:07.661 --> 22:10.462
Okay, that's, that's good.

22:18.605 --> 22:21.573
This is an important piece
for the, keeping the water
out of the roof there.

22:21.909 --> 22:24.643
So we're going to reuse
it since it's not broken and
there's nothing wrong with it.

22:25.412 --> 22:28.346
And, uh, it's probably
been here with the cabin
since the cabin was made.

22:30.584 --> 22:33.218
We put a lot of effort into
heat here in the arctic.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.855
It's something
you're constantly thinking
about, being dry and warm.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.591
CAROL: If I could reach it.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.194
CHIP: Now, this is made
to go straight, okay?

22:42.429 --> 22:44.462
CAROL: Okay.
AGNES: Okay.

22:44.998 --> 22:45.964
CHIP: You got it?

22:45.999 --> 22:47.933
CAROL: Yeah.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.610
AGNES: You think
you got it, Carol?

23:06.486 --> 23:08.820
AGNES: Carol.
CAROL: What?
AGNES: Help me.

23:11.091 --> 23:12.591
Okay, your feet now, Chip.

23:12.626 --> 23:13.825
One, two, three, go.

23:13.861 --> 23:15.093
You ready?

23:15.128 --> 23:16.294
CAROL: Watch your,
watch those nails.

23:16.330 --> 23:17.762
AGNES: Here, put your feet up.

23:17.798 --> 23:18.964
One, two, three, go.

23:18.999 --> 23:21.933
Oh, my God, how am
I gonna get back down?

23:22.169 --> 23:24.102
Oh, now what were
we doing, Chip?

23:24.137 --> 23:25.537
CHIP: Attaching the pipe.

23:30.110 --> 23:32.611
AGNES: Oh, my God, yeah.

23:35.949 --> 23:39.718
CAROL: Okay, now it's good.
AGNES: Yup, there you go.

23:40.988 --> 23:42.520
Thank you, Carol.

23:42.556 --> 23:45.257
Now, we just got to try to
figure out how to go down.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.960
CHIP: Your fine,
you're just a foot away
from the, there you go.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.364
See you're so short,
that's why it seems
like it's so far away.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.599
AGNES: Yeah.

23:54.902 --> 23:56.401
CAROL: Whoa. I'm good.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.535
CHIP: It's all right.

23:57.571 --> 23:59.838
We're good.

24:09.583 --> 24:10.815
AGNES: Right on?

24:10.851 --> 24:12.350
We got a lot of
stuff to do tomorrow.

24:12.386 --> 24:14.486
We got to try to rest
now that we got heat.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.554
We get up tomorrow
and go fishing.

24:16.590 --> 24:18.690
CAROL: Yup.

24:19.426 --> 24:22.294
CHIP: We'll all relax and, uh,
start again tomorrow, okay?

24:26.700 --> 24:29.134
ERIK: The lifestyle
that I get to live up here
as a hunting guide and a

24:29.169 --> 24:32.037
subsistence hunter and
trapper is pretty unique.

24:32.339 --> 24:34.372
And there's a lot
of work associated with
it, but I think there's

24:34.408 --> 24:36.775
more pros than cons.

24:42.516 --> 24:44.049
MARTHA MAE: Oh yeah, this
is pretty good right here.

24:44.084 --> 24:45.550
Yeah.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.086
<i> NARRATOR: After ditching</i>
<i> their boat for dry land,</i>

24:48.121 --> 24:51.289
<i> Erik and Martha change</i>
<i> strategies in their</i>
<i> quest to harvest food.</i>

24:52.192 --> 24:55.293
Erik: Depending on the
conditions, we use boats,
we use four wheelers.

24:55.329 --> 24:56.828
We use our feet.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.663
And sometimes we sit and call.

24:58.699 --> 25:00.665
Other times, we spot
and stalk ducks.

25:11.094 --> 25:13.395
ERIK: There's some out there.

25:22.289 --> 25:24.873
(gunshot)

25:25.942 --> 25:27.876
I'm kind of
sick of sitting here.

25:27.911 --> 25:31.346
You want to go and try to
stalk up some of those birds
that landed over there?

25:34.451 --> 25:38.053
ERIK: Let's just walk
in the woods and see
what comes our way.

25:44.127 --> 25:47.729
<i> NARRATOR: Erik and Martha</i>
<i> are stalking the woods along</i>
<i> the Newhalen River to harvest</i>

25:47.764 --> 25:50.465
<i> waterfowl before the birds</i>
<i> migrate south for the winter.</i>

25:56.773 --> 26:00.942
ERIK: All the meat that I eat
in my household is meat that
either I harvested myself,

26:00.977 --> 26:05.280
or meat that's recycled
to me via my hunters that I
guide every spring and fall.

26:06.883 --> 26:09.017
You know, that's not an
unlimited resource up here.

26:09.052 --> 26:12.120
You got to realize
that these animals
need to be respected,

26:12.155 --> 26:14.656
and that you need to really
be careful about how many

26:14.691 --> 26:16.391
you harvest and
what you do harvest,

26:16.426 --> 26:18.993
you should use to
the fullest capacity.

26:24.134 --> 26:25.700
Fish.

26:26.269 --> 26:28.937
A (bleep) load of
them over there.

26:30.791 --> 26:32.373
There's some out there.

27:27.464 --> 27:30.648
(gunshots).

27:36.706 --> 27:38.973
MARTHA MAE: Where'd it
go, is it still alive?

27:42.179 --> 27:44.946
There it is.

27:47.918 --> 27:49.651
Who got it, you think?

27:49.686 --> 27:51.920
ERIK: Who cares?
Let's go home and eat it.
You going to make soup?

27:51.955 --> 27:53.087
MARTHA MAE: Yeah,
I'll make some soup.

27:53.123 --> 27:55.056
ERIK: Nice, let's go home.

27:55.492 --> 27:58.893
I'm going to head home,
and I'm going to have some
fresh duck, nice and fat.

27:59.663 --> 28:02.597
We're going to chow down on
some delicious table fare.

28:02.632 --> 28:06.534
So go home, clean up these
birds, and call it a day.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.143
CHIP: Our kids work with us.

28:15.178 --> 28:17.078
Not for us, but with us.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.547
And it's absolutely the
best way to ever teach them.

28:23.720 --> 28:24.802
CHIP: Grab the bucket.

28:28.475 --> 28:29.774
CAROL: Uh-hmm.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.210
CHIP: I wanna bring
those fishing rods and
those lures over there.

28:32.245 --> 28:34.479
I think we could have
a pretty good time.

28:34.748 --> 28:37.882
I'm going to, uh, show my
girls how to use fishing
poles, or fishing rods.

28:37.918 --> 28:40.084
We don't really use
casting rods much.

28:40.620 --> 28:44.822
But, um, hopefully the
girls will, uh, get a chance
to sucker some pike in.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.325
AGNES: Right on, we
got fishing poles.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.394
CHIP: Jump in.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.796
AGNES: Um, should I
put this in the back?

28:51.831 --> 28:53.831
CHIP: There we go.

28:55.101 --> 28:58.353
AGNES: Hey, never go to
the lower camp yet, I
hope it's still there.

29:00.507 --> 29:02.840
CHIP: We'll we're going
down to the mouth camp
right now, down by the,

29:02.876 --> 29:04.642
where the river meets the sea.

29:04.678 --> 29:08.479
Do some casting for some pike.

29:09.382 --> 29:12.650
We call this the lower camp.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.720
There's a really old
building here my wife
grew up in as a kid.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.655
They call it Nuluk
which is sleep.

29:17.924 --> 29:20.858
So, I guess they
used to sleep before
they crossed the lake.

29:21.194 --> 29:24.028
AGNES: We haven't
gotten down this way for
quite some time but, uh,

29:24.064 --> 29:25.396
it's a good change up.

29:25.432 --> 29:28.633
It's a good place to
fish and it's a beautiful
day for fishing.

29:28.668 --> 29:31.502
I think we're gonna
have a nice time here.

29:31.738 --> 29:34.639
CHIP: There's a pole here
for you girls to try out
if you wanna try your poles.

29:34.674 --> 29:36.507
Everybody's got a pole.

29:36.509 --> 29:38.209
I wanted to try out
a, um, fishing rod.

29:38.245 --> 29:40.345
I haven't used a fishing
rod since I was a kid.

29:40.380 --> 29:43.248
So, I figured it would be
fun for my kids to try, too.

29:46.620 --> 29:48.186
CAROL: Oh, no.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.822
CHIP: Well, now you got
to stop and untangle it.

29:50.857 --> 29:51.990
You got it?

29:52.025 --> 29:54.325
Okay, now tighten it up.

29:57.530 --> 30:00.765
I don't know if it's
dinnertime for pike or not.

30:03.136 --> 30:05.169
All right, I like that.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.473
I've not got him on yet
but yup, I landed him.

30:08.508 --> 30:10.375
Now, it's time to be happy.

30:11.411 --> 30:13.544
I just got this, can
you believe that?

30:14.047 --> 30:17.048
This just took a couple
minutes and I got a pike now.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.116
I'm pretty happy.

30:18.151 --> 30:20.451
Folks around here called
these, um, Siilik.

30:20.487 --> 30:23.354
So now I am one Siilik rich.

30:23.390 --> 30:25.056
There's gonna, bound
to be quite a few more.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.792
So, just keep casting
and messing with them.

30:28.061 --> 30:29.527
AGNES: Qutan, oh
yeah, you got it.

30:29.562 --> 30:30.862
Yup and you put it back.

30:30.897 --> 30:33.197
Yup, there you go fisher girl.

30:34.067 --> 30:35.767
You got yours, Mary?

30:35.802 --> 30:36.834
Oh.

30:36.870 --> 30:39.003
QUTAN: I got one.
AGNES: Oh, you got one!

30:44.778 --> 30:45.977
QUTAN: I got one.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.612
AGNES: Oh, you got one!

30:47.647 --> 30:49.247
QUTAN: Oh, look at this, yeah!

30:49.282 --> 30:50.648
AGNES: Pull it up, Qutan!

30:50.684 --> 30:52.950
CHIP: Oh, I'm gonna go check
out what the ladies caught.

30:55.355 --> 30:56.888
AGNES: Hold on, whoa.

30:57.357 --> 30:59.791
CHIP: Whoa, much bigger
than the one I caught.

30:59.826 --> 31:01.426
AGNES: Qutan!

31:01.461 --> 31:03.561
We just got here to the
lower camp and we've been
here five minutes and we've

31:03.596 --> 31:06.364
already got a couple fish,
so it's a good day for fishing.

31:07.634 --> 31:10.968
CHIP: Once you get
a fish on and you land it,
it's pretty hard to give up

31:11.004 --> 31:12.904
this kind of sport.

31:12.939 --> 31:16.274
It's a lot of fun.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:16.309 --> 31:18.409
AGNES: Oh, your dad's got one.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.479
CHIP: There we go.
We got another one.

31:21.514 --> 31:25.049
Catching pike
and catching any kind of
fish is just food for us.

31:25.085 --> 31:26.984
It's food we don't have
to pay for at the store.

31:27.020 --> 31:28.519
It's also really good food.

31:28.555 --> 31:29.587
It's, it's wholesome.

31:29.622 --> 31:30.722
It's delicious.

31:30.757 --> 31:32.357
It's from the land.

31:32.392 --> 31:34.792
You know, it's all part
of making a good living with
the resources around you.

31:34.828 --> 31:37.261
And these are the resources
that are around us.

31:37.297 --> 31:39.630
AGNES: It won't
open its mouth.

31:43.670 --> 31:45.837
CHIP: It's time to head
off down towards other
fishing spots to see if

31:45.872 --> 31:47.638
we can collect upon some pikes
somewhere else.

31:47.974 --> 31:50.108
AGNES: Probably if
we go for a little ride,
we might catch sheefish

31:50.143 --> 31:51.943
or something different.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.044
CHIP: You guys ready?

31:53.079 --> 31:55.380
AGNES: Yeah, we sure are.

31:59.319 --> 32:03.321
ERIK: This is the life
that I've chosen to live,
and it's just what we do.

32:12.332 --> 32:14.265
ERIK: Martha and
I have been really busy
the entire summer running

32:14.300 --> 32:15.566
our fishing lodge,

32:15.602 --> 32:17.034
and we're here
right at the end.

32:17.070 --> 32:19.771
Our last client
left yesterday, we're
leaving Iliamna for Wiseman

32:19.806 --> 32:21.606
in a few days.

32:22.175 --> 32:25.176
<i> NARRATOR: Erik and Martha</i>
<i> have spent the summer</i>
<i> at their lodge in Iliamna,</i>

32:25.211 --> 32:28.813
<i> taking advantage of the</i>
<i> area's resources to maintain</i>
<i> their subsistence lifestyle.</i>

32:30.517 --> 32:35.253
<i>With dark winter approaching,</i>
<i>the couple has one last chance</i>
<i>at harvesting salmon before</i>

32:35.288 --> 32:36.921
<i> they return to Wiseman.</i>

32:37.891 --> 32:40.458
ERIK: You know, Martha
and I eat a lot of fish,
it's a real nice break to

32:40.493 --> 32:42.193
break up our red meat diet

32:42.228 --> 32:45.430
that we primarily eat up
there with moose and sheep
and caribou, and, uh,

32:45.465 --> 32:48.800
we just wanted to get
out here, put up a
few fish of our own,

32:48.835 --> 32:51.936
and be able to
take those fish home to
Wiseman for the winter.

32:53.907 --> 32:57.708
So these fish here in the
Iliamna drainage are sockeye
salmon that are locally known

32:57.744 --> 33:00.278
as reds, one of the best
eating fish on earth.

33:05.485 --> 33:06.984
MARTHA MAE: Fish on!

33:06.986 --> 33:08.252
ERIK: Fish on?

33:11.958 --> 33:13.941
MARTHA MAE: It's foul-hooked.

33:14.227 --> 33:16.327
For salmon, you gotta
catch 'em in the mouth,
you're not allowed to keep

33:16.362 --> 33:17.995
'em unless you do,

33:18.031 --> 33:20.665
so when you hook 'em on
the fin or anywhere else on
the body besides the mouth,

33:20.700 --> 33:24.402
you have to let 'em go,
'cause it's called a foul hook
and that's sports fishing.

33:25.538 --> 33:27.638
ERIK: Well, let's head
downriver below the rapids.

33:27.674 --> 33:31.676
I think the fish are better,
even that one was a little
reddish, it's kinda turning.

33:31.711 --> 33:34.412
I think the fish below the
rapids are far less beat up.

33:34.447 --> 33:35.646
MARTHA MAE: Let me
fish a couple more.

33:35.682 --> 33:37.315
ERIK: Oh, you wanna fish more.

33:37.350 --> 33:40.751
Okay, girl loves to fish.

33:43.122 --> 33:46.224
MARTHA MAE: The water coming
down the river right now
is all silty and glaciery,

33:46.759 --> 33:50.995
and it comes into this little
creek right here and then you
can't see the fish anymore,

33:52.165 --> 33:54.465
because it's all murky.

33:54.501 --> 33:58.436
ERIK: I told Martha like
ten minutes ago like,
let's go, and she agreed,

33:58.471 --> 34:01.205
and she's still
over there fishing.

34:01.241 --> 34:03.341
The girl is obsessed
with fishing.

34:03.743 --> 34:08.012
Push the boat off here
and pick Martha up since
she refuses to quit ever and

34:08.047 --> 34:10.448
see if we can't get on the
fish a little bit better.

34:15.288 --> 34:17.722
MARTHA MAE: How am I
supposed to get in?

34:18.658 --> 34:20.024
Like that?

34:20.059 --> 34:22.493
ERIK: Yeah.

34:25.265 --> 34:27.498
MARTHA MAE: It's swift
out there right now.

34:27.534 --> 34:30.868
I've been fishing at the same
spot since I can remember.

34:30.904 --> 34:33.604
Coming here for 24 years.

34:34.707 --> 34:36.874
I have a lot of good
memories over here.

34:36.910 --> 34:40.278
Fish come by this one
rock every single year, and
it's the greatest fishing

34:40.313 --> 34:42.179
spot for red salmon.

34:42.682 --> 34:45.016
Wow!

34:45.818 --> 34:47.685
There's a lot of fish.

34:47.720 --> 34:50.021
I still feel like a little
kid when I come out here.

34:50.056 --> 34:52.757
ERIK: Of course you
go to the best spot.

34:52.792 --> 34:56.394
I love my wife, but she's
a game and a fish hog.

35:00.500 --> 35:04.302
Look how net
rashed that one is.

35:05.305 --> 35:09.273
Yeah, the fish are just,
different days, they run
up in different ways.

35:09.309 --> 35:11.876
We're foul hooking
a bunch of them.

35:11.911 --> 35:14.946
It's one of those kind of
fisheries you, you can fish
all over the world and be a

35:14.981 --> 35:18.516
great angler, and then
you come up here to Alaska
and try this and you gotta

35:18.551 --> 35:20.618
get dialed in.

35:20.653 --> 35:23.688
Haven't got dialed in yet,
but uh, once we get dialed,

35:23.723 --> 35:25.656
we'll punch 'em
out pretty quick.

35:25.925 --> 35:27.358
MARTHA MAE: Oh, that
was in the mouth!

35:27.393 --> 35:29.193
ERIK: Was it?

35:31.497 --> 35:34.298
That's the first salmon of
the day that we've caught
legally in the mouth.

35:35.034 --> 35:37.668
This is some really
good, good fresh meat.

35:37.704 --> 35:40.905
Meat like this sells for
19.99 in supermarkets
across America.

35:43.142 --> 35:46.243
It's found free here
in the wilds of Alaska.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.514
MARTHA MAE: Hey!

35:51.818 --> 35:52.917
ERIK: Mouth?

35:52.952 --> 35:54.585
MARTHA MAE: Yup.

35:59.826 --> 36:01.225
ERIK: Nice job, honey.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.628
Keep it off the rocks.

36:04.864 --> 36:07.898
Nice, all right,
we got the limit!

36:08.901 --> 36:10.534
So this is the last
fish of our limit today.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.308
Martha and I had the goal to
put up a couple hundred pounds
of salmon for the winter.

36:18.044 --> 36:19.977
Got our last 10
in the Rubbermaid.

36:20.013 --> 36:22.013
We're gonna go home,
set 'em up, clean 'em.

36:22.048 --> 36:23.948
Ship these fish to Wiseman.

36:24.484 --> 36:25.916
MARTHA MAE: And
have fish head soup.

36:25.952 --> 36:27.885
ERIK: And definitely have
fish head soup tonight.

36:28.154 --> 36:29.820
MARTHA MAE: I'm so hungry.

36:29.856 --> 36:32.056
ERIK: Let's rock
and roll, babe.

36:37.730 --> 36:40.498
CHIP: It's not shopping in a
store, but we call it shopping
because we're trying to go

36:40.533 --> 36:43.300
home with the goods, the food.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.542
AGNES: It's a good
place for fishing.

36:52.612 --> 36:55.012
CHIP: Oh, it's chilly
out here, ain't it?

36:55.048 --> 36:56.647
AGNES: Yeah, a little
rough but not too bad.

36:56.683 --> 36:58.482
CHIP: You can see though
that the ice isn't
very far away at all.

36:58.518 --> 37:00.184
AGNES: Yup.

37:00.219 --> 37:04.221
CHIP: But it takes the ocean
a whole month more to thaw
out than it does the river.

37:04.257 --> 37:06.590
It's always the river first.

37:09.562 --> 37:13.330
<i> NARRATOR: The Hailstones</i>

<i> Kookoochiaq for fish that can</i>

37:15.668 --> 37:17.468
AGNES: Pass one to, um, Carol.

37:17.503 --> 37:19.036
CHIP: You know,
we've already got a nice,

37:19.072 --> 37:21.572
nice amount of pike
back there at the camp.

37:21.607 --> 37:24.875
And, uh, we come down
to where the river meets the
sea and this brackish water

37:24.911 --> 37:26.677
is where the sheefish are.

37:26.713 --> 37:28.813
Oh, man. One jumped
right behind my lure.

37:28.848 --> 37:30.681
It's a little bit
of everything here.

37:30.717 --> 37:31.916
QUTAN: You got one?

37:31.951 --> 37:33.384
AGNES: She's got one.
She got one!

37:33.419 --> 37:34.518
CHIP: Oh, she's got one!

37:34.554 --> 37:35.619
QUTAN: Oh!

37:35.655 --> 37:36.821
CHIP: Get a hook,
get a hook on.

37:36.856 --> 37:38.189
CAROL: It's a big one!
Holy cow, dad!

37:38.224 --> 37:40.124
QUTAN: Whoa!
CHIP: Hook it!
Hook it in the face!

37:41.210 --> 37:42.510
CAROL: Holy cow,

37:42.545 --> 37:44.178
QUTAN: Whoa!
CHIP: Hook it!
QUTAN: Whoa!

37:44.213 --> 37:45.479
CHIP: Hook it in the face.

37:45.515 --> 37:48.716
CAROL: It's a fighter.
Whoa, it's gone.

37:49.719 --> 37:51.185
CHIP: Oh, it's gone?

37:51.220 --> 37:52.319
CAROL: Holy.

37:52.405 --> 37:53.687
CHIP: Well, let's
get another one.

37:53.706 --> 37:57.124
CAROL: Holy cow.
CHIP: It's a lot of fun, huh?
CAROL: Yup.

37:57.160 --> 37:58.559
CHIP: You never know
what you'll get.

37:58.594 --> 38:00.194
CAROL: Ah! Again.

38:00.229 --> 38:03.464
CHIP: Yeah, you got to be
mindful of other people's
eyes and faces and stuff.

38:03.532 --> 38:06.834
If you hook someone's
eye, they ain't gonna
get no help out here.

38:08.504 --> 38:09.804
We're all learning, you know.

38:09.839 --> 38:11.405
This is, uh, something
I haven't done
since I was a kid.

38:11.441 --> 38:12.807
And I want my
daughters to learn how.

38:12.842 --> 38:14.642
This is a lot of fun.

38:14.744 --> 38:15.876
Oh, yeah.

38:15.912 --> 38:17.578
This is a big one.

38:17.980 --> 38:19.914
Oh, that's a big pike.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.984
QUTAN: I got one!
AGNES: Oh, Qutan's got one.

38:24.020 --> 38:25.152
Oh, I need that!

38:25.188 --> 38:27.087
It's a sheefish,
give me the hook!

38:27.323 --> 38:29.290
CHIP: Just a second.
Okay here you go.

38:30.460 --> 38:32.726
Whoa, yeah!
A sheefish and a pike!

38:32.762 --> 38:34.428
AGNES: We got it!

38:34.464 --> 38:36.897
Look, Qutan, you
got a perfect one.

38:36.933 --> 38:38.065
It's a sheefish.

38:38.100 --> 38:40.434
This is what we're having
for dinner when we get back.

38:45.608 --> 38:48.008
CHIP: We came down here
to the mouth to catch pike
and to catch sheefish and

38:48.044 --> 38:49.176
we're catching them both.

38:49.212 --> 38:51.512
Oh, I got another one on!

38:53.015 --> 38:55.282
It's just a fishing
day, this is what
we're here to do.

38:55.318 --> 38:58.152
And you know what they
say about showing someone
to fish versus giving

38:58.187 --> 38:59.787
someone a fish.

38:59.822 --> 39:02.356
CAROL: Wow, that's a big one.

39:03.159 --> 39:05.192
CHIP: That's a good-sized one.

39:09.298 --> 39:10.498
AGNES: So we've
done real good.

39:10.533 --> 39:12.166
We caught a lot of
sheefish and pike.

39:12.201 --> 39:13.367
I'm happy.

39:13.402 --> 39:16.036
Time to go warm
up and make a fire
and eat some fish.

39:22.778 --> 39:24.044
CHIP: Well, the fire's
going really good,

39:24.080 --> 39:25.479
so I'm gonna let
this burn down to coals and

39:25.515 --> 39:27.081
I'll start cooking dinner.

39:27.116 --> 39:29.984
If you wanna cut up that
last sheefish that we caught,
it'll be the freshest.

39:30.019 --> 39:32.653
AGNES: Yup, Carol's got
that right here actually.

39:32.688 --> 39:36.857
CAROL: Yup.
AGNES: She's scaling it, too.

39:37.560 --> 39:39.026
It's nice to be out
here with my girls.

39:39.061 --> 39:41.428
I don't even have to ask them
to start cutting the fish.

39:41.964 --> 39:44.765
I used to have to
sit there and help them
and show them, but now,

39:44.800 --> 39:47.001
they can just pretty much
cut them on their own.

39:50.206 --> 39:53.707
Good to come to where
I used to grow up and fish
and stuff like that and

39:53.743 --> 39:55.242
let the girls come here

39:55.278 --> 39:58.879
and have an idea
at least of where my
camps are, you know.

39:58.915 --> 40:01.882
They might just get
right into these places.

40:02.218 --> 40:02.349
CHIP: Well, this meal's done.

40:04.453 --> 40:06.387
CHIP: Grab a fork.

40:10.426 --> 40:11.992
Oh my God, it's sweet.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.496
AGNES: Thank you, girls,
this is a real good dinner.

40:15.531 --> 40:18.866
I enjoyed the dinner, I
enjoyed the way we caught
these fish because I don't

40:18.901 --> 40:20.668
usually catch fish this way.

40:22.038 --> 40:24.939
You girls did a pretty
good job using your
rods catching fish.

40:26.943 --> 40:28.742
CAROL: That was a lot of fun.

40:28.778 --> 40:31.378
CHIP: You girls are learning
this country, now you're
learning these waters.

40:31.414 --> 40:34.381
And if you choose to live
this way and wanna fish
and hunt for a living,

40:34.417 --> 40:37.751
this is one of the
places you can do it and
do it quite, quite well.

40:39.755 --> 40:40.921
ERIK: Life is good.

40:40.957 --> 40:42.089
Life is busy.

40:42.124 --> 40:44.758
I like to get out and
just get my hands dirty.

40:53.903 --> 40:55.936
<i> NARRATOR: After catching</i>
<i> their limit of salmon,</i>

40:55.972 --> 40:58.172
<i> Erik and Martha begin to</i>
<i> process the fish so they can</i>

40:58.207 --> 41:00.207
<i> be shipped to their</i>

41:01.310 --> 41:03.544
MARTHA MAE: Let's get
this done and eat.

41:03.579 --> 41:06.280
ERIK: Even though we use
the salmon to, to sell
and bring guests in,

41:06.315 --> 41:09.717
we also love to eat salmon.

41:10.019 --> 41:12.186
There's not a whole lot
of salmon up in Wiseman.

41:12.221 --> 41:15.689
So every year, when
we leave Iliamna for that
at the end of the summer,

41:15.791 --> 41:18.392
we make sure that we bring a
couple hundred pounds with us.

41:18.728 --> 41:21.695
You won't find a filet
much fresher than that in
your local supermarket.

41:22.531 --> 41:25.766
Every time Martha and
I go into a grocery store
and we see a sockeye salmon

41:25.801 --> 41:27.267
we'd laugh and we look,

41:27.303 --> 41:29.303
and we look at one fish
in there and think about how

41:29.338 --> 41:32.973
that's $100 and we
say man, all you just, all
you got to do is go in the

41:33.009 --> 41:36.477
boat and putt
along a few minutes and
you're gonna come out with

41:36.512 --> 41:38.746
several thousand
dollars in fish.

41:42.518 --> 41:46.387
We got these fish all cleaned
up, filleted, and now we're
gonna go ahead and vacuum seal

41:46.422 --> 41:48.789
these fillets and get them
ready to ship up to Wiseman.

41:49.191 --> 41:50.824
MARTHA MAE: All right.

41:57.199 --> 41:59.266
What are we up for
poundage right now?

41:59.301 --> 42:00.968
ERIK: 50-pound mark.

42:01.003 --> 42:02.670
MARTHA MAE: Last two.

42:02.938 --> 42:05.272
ERIK: All right, where's that,
can you grab that Sharpie?

42:05.307 --> 42:07.007
MARTHA MAE: Sure,
let me turn this off.

42:07.043 --> 42:09.576
Even though we're leaving
Iliamna, we're taking a little
bit of it with us, which is,

42:09.612 --> 42:12.913
uh, the red salmon that
we're vacuum sealing here
and bringing with us.

42:12.948 --> 42:16.650
So, in a couple months when
we're kind of missing Iliamna,
we'll be able to break out

42:16.686 --> 42:18.919
some of that salmon
and, uh, enjoy it again.

42:19.889 --> 42:22.289
ERIK: All right, we're
ready to roll, I think.

42:22.324 --> 42:23.891
Let's go ship this out.

42:23.926 --> 42:26.360
Let's ship it to
Wiseman and, uh, we'll
go back to the lodge,

42:26.395 --> 42:28.762
start breaking things
down, and close
it up for the season.

42:28.798 --> 42:30.564
I got the fish,
you got the door?
