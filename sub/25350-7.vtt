00:11.344 --> 00:13.211
There's so much chaos.

00:13.213 --> 00:15.480
I think a lot of people
died here.

00:15.482 --> 00:18.549
I've had an employee
pushed down the stairs.

00:18.551 --> 00:19.885
I need your help
desperately.

00:19.887 --> 00:23.555
They have to leave us alone.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.557
She's oozing blood.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.959
She was telling me,
"Don't trust men.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.027
They will kill you."

00:29.029 --> 00:30.695
My God.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.232
This is a very bad person.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.834
And I just feel fear.

00:36.836 --> 00:38.836
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.838 --> 00:41.973
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.174
I see dead people.

00:43.176 --> 00:45.477
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.378
I speak to dead people.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.314
She hates them, hates them.

00:50.316 --> 00:52.717
And they speak to me.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.187
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:56.189 --> 00:59.457
It's a demon.
It's Satan.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.992
I rely on my partner.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.593
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.595 --> 01:04.863
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.330
What was the body count,
what happened?

01:06.332 --> 01:10.001
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.469
I don't know if
it's a demon or not,

01:11.471 --> 01:12.937
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.539
It's my job to reveal them.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.008
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.877
But Steve and I never speak...

01:18.879 --> 01:20.946
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.280
...until the very end...

01:22.282 --> 01:24.349
I don't even want
to show you this.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.517
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:26.519 --> 01:28.619
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.555
...or time to get out.

01:30.557 --> 01:32.089
You have to get out.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

01:45.838 --> 01:48.973
So, I'm down here in
the Big Easy, New Orleans,

01:48.975 --> 01:50.775
and I got a call
from a guy named Alec.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.578
Now, he bought an old church
in town and turned it into

01:53.580 --> 01:56.314
what he thought would be
his dream restaurant,

01:56.316 --> 01:58.115
but the activity is so violent,

01:58.117 --> 02:00.185
he wishes he never set foot
in the place.

02:00.187 --> 02:02.587
He told me activity is
getting worse by the day,

02:02.589 --> 02:03.788
and it's only a matter of time

02:03.790 --> 02:05.657
before someone gets
seriously hurt.

02:09.930 --> 02:14.733
I can't hide the fact that this
is a church-turned-restaurant,

02:14.735 --> 02:16.667
but I still need to cover
leading information

02:16.669 --> 02:21.005
like religious symbols,
artwork, and menus

02:21.007 --> 02:23.608
that could influence
Amy's findings.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.811
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.059
There's so much chaos.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.229
There's a lot of people.

02:44.231 --> 02:47.032
There's people in the ground,

02:47.034 --> 02:49.834
and I'm seeing, you know,
people being killed.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.237
It's bad.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.115
All right, Alec,
I'm glad I'm here

03:04.117 --> 03:05.383
'cause when we talked
on the phone,

03:05.385 --> 03:07.919
it didn't sound too good,
so what's going on?

03:07.921 --> 03:11.723
Paranormal activity here
is out of control.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.591
It's not only
hurting my business,

03:13.593 --> 03:16.994
I'm worried about the
endangerment of my employees,

03:16.996 --> 03:18.729
my customer base.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.665
I need your help
desperately.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.334
So, obviously this place
used to be a church, right?
Yes.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.203
Do you know any history
about the property?

03:25.205 --> 03:28.739
Built in 1914, operated
as a Lutheran church

03:28.741 --> 03:33.878
until it was bought by the first
restaurant owners in 1977,

03:33.880 --> 03:38.149
and in 2005, Katrina hit,
flooded, closed.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.484
How long
have you been here?

03:39.486 --> 03:41.486
My partner, Eddie, and I
bought it sight unseen

03:41.488 --> 03:42.820
at the end of 2015.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.222
So you bought this
sight unseen?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.291
- Absolutely.
- Now, why would you do that?

03:46.293 --> 03:47.959
This place
just called to me,

03:47.961 --> 03:49.960
but from the minute
I walked in here,

03:49.962 --> 03:51.362
something was not right.

03:51.364 --> 03:54.966
I turned to Eddie, and I said,
"I think we made a mistake."

03:54.968 --> 03:56.101
You regretting it?

03:56.103 --> 03:58.002
Many days I regret, yes.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.972
Give me a list of what
everybody's experiencing here.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.641
Most of us feel like we're
being watched all the time.

04:03.643 --> 04:04.909
Okay.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.845
Objects flying in the air.

04:07.847 --> 04:10.581
We hear disembodied voices,

04:10.583 --> 04:12.984
and we see shadow figures.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.120
A lot of the people here
get touched,

04:15.122 --> 04:18.055
and, honestly, we have
a lot of bad luck here.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.791
And the bad luck --
what's that all about?

04:19.793 --> 04:22.860
If anything can go wrong,
it will go wrong here.

04:22.862 --> 04:23.994
From the minute
we walked in here,

04:23.996 --> 04:25.996
turned on the air conditioner --
blew.

04:25.998 --> 04:28.866
Refrigerator, two years old --
blew.

04:28.868 --> 04:32.403
Tables, brand-new --
after 6 months, warped.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.671
All right.
So you guys own a restaurant.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.740
It's a business.
Things go wrong.

04:35.742 --> 04:36.875
Why is this paranormal?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.342
We have four other
restaurants.

04:38.344 --> 04:41.012
Nothing like this happens
at any of them, ever.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.080
All right, look,
you got four other restaurants.

04:43.082 --> 04:45.550
Why don't you just sell this one
and focus on the other ones?

04:45.552 --> 04:50.621
This is the one that was
a labor of love, passion,

04:50.623 --> 04:51.889
but we're not leaving.

04:51.891 --> 04:54.158
They have to leave us alone.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.734
There's a lot of dead people.

05:03.736 --> 05:08.306
It's literally like all of these
people are running around you.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.645
I can't breathe.
Like, I can't...

05:13.647 --> 05:15.713
Like, someone can't
catch their breath,

05:15.715 --> 05:19.317
so I think that the living
would feel this.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.653
I think that some people
could become overwhelmed

05:21.655 --> 05:23.388
to the point where
they're feeling all of this,

05:23.390 --> 05:26.725
and I think that they could have
a panic attack because of it.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.134
Okay, Alec, so what's
going on out here?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.469
Every time
I come out here,

05:38.471 --> 05:40.271
It's like somebody's
watching me.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.540
Like,
something is curious,

05:42.542 --> 05:44.542
or you think it's, like,
kind of leering at you?

05:44.544 --> 05:48.279
Leering at me, watching me,
every move I make.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.548
Okay.
What else is going on?

05:50.550 --> 05:52.550
Well, a lot of times
in the office,

05:52.552 --> 05:54.152
I'll be sitting there
working.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.753
All of a sudden,
I'll feel something

05:55.755 --> 05:57.622
touching
the back of my neck.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.690
Can you tell
male, female?

05:59.692 --> 06:00.958
No, just...

06:00.960 --> 06:04.362
It's just this light brush,
hand on the neck.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.763
How often
does that happen?

06:05.765 --> 06:08.098
Probably happened 10, 15 times
since we've been here.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.367
And you're alone in the office
when this --

06:09.369 --> 06:11.302
I'm alone normally, yeah.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.204
All right, so anything else
weird like that?

06:13.206 --> 06:17.041
Yeah. Actually, coming down
the stairs a lot of times,

06:17.043 --> 06:20.377
I'll feel, like,
a whish of cold air.

06:20.379 --> 06:23.448
And how long does that
sensation of that cold last?

06:23.450 --> 06:24.649
Three or four seconds.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.050
All right, we're in the South.
It's hot.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.452
You got air-conditioning.
Are you sure it's not that?

06:27.454 --> 06:29.253
There's no air ducts
in that area.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.455
I look around. I'm like,
"Where did that come from?"

06:31.457 --> 06:32.923
What do you think
this is all about?

06:32.925 --> 06:35.793
I think whatever is here,
they just don't want us here.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.595
They want us gone.

06:42.735 --> 06:46.070
There is this dead woman.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.140
She's wearing red
and a red wig.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.409
She says she does not like men,

06:51.411 --> 06:54.411
and she wrapped
her left arm around me.

06:54.413 --> 06:55.546
She hugged me.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.148
She sent ice-cold chills
through my body.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.218
The living would
experience this.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.957
This woman is surrounded
by the color red.

07:05.959 --> 07:09.761
Red --
just being engulfed in red,

07:09.763 --> 07:15.166
like a aura, basically,
the type of Hell.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.873
What's going on in here?

07:22.875 --> 07:26.244
I've seen a misty figure
outside the kitchen doors.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.178
Okay, so what's it
look like to you?

07:28.180 --> 07:30.114
- The outline of a monk.
- A monk?

07:30.116 --> 07:31.782
- Yes.
- Okay.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.586
So, now, is anybody else
besides you seeing this?

07:34.588 --> 07:37.855
The staff sees shadows
all over the building.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.323
All right, Alec.
So, anything else?

07:39.325 --> 07:40.525
Came in one morning.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.393
All the burners were on.
They were all on.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.396
Every burner on that stove
was on.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.664
Did somebody come in
in the middle of the night?

07:46.666 --> 07:48.333
Impossible.
The alarm is set.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.734
We know if anybody
enters or leaves.

07:50.736 --> 07:54.072
I got to tell you --
you're lucky nobody got hurt

07:54.074 --> 07:56.740
or this place didn't burn down
or explode, as well.

07:56.742 --> 07:58.075
Yes.

07:58.077 --> 07:59.543
Okay, so anything else?

07:59.545 --> 08:04.081
We've had dishes fly off
the rack over here.

08:04.083 --> 08:07.218
The chef actually was standing
right over here,

08:07.220 --> 08:10.221
and they flew off, and he turned
and basically freaked out.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.089
The last thing you want
is somebody getting hurt.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.158
That's the worst thing
that could happen here.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.361
I've had an employee
pushed down the stairs.

08:16.363 --> 08:19.230
I mean, we have got to make it
safe here for them.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.699
It's more than
just a business.

08:21.701 --> 08:24.768
They are family, and we want
to take care of them.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.305
We have got to stop
the insanity, the madness.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.040
We've got to
solve the problem.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.642
What's going on?

08:33.980 --> 08:37.515
This lady in red is really bad.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.517
Do you know if the living
have any experiences with her?

08:39.519 --> 08:44.254
She is very physical --
punching, pulling hair, pushing,

08:44.256 --> 08:48.259
anything like that
to get them away from her.

08:50.864 --> 08:54.298
I think if she felt
severely threatened,

08:54.300 --> 08:56.601
she might be dangerous.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.002
She would freak out.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.471
If she's in a mood,
it's not gonna be a good day.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.945
This lady in red has these
weird shadow things with her,

09:06.947 --> 09:08.479
but they're not human.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.214
They're destructive.

09:10.216 --> 09:14.218
What's happening is like
a chaos and destruction.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.290
So that's not good.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.492
Now, the woman in red is saying

09:21.494 --> 09:24.095
that she just wants to get
the **** out of here,

09:24.097 --> 09:27.231
and that's why
she's doing what she's doing.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.966
She stirred up a whole storm.

09:57.796 --> 09:59.029
So, Eddie, talking to Alec,

09:59.031 --> 10:01.398
he was convinced
that this place is dangerous.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.501
I mean,
do you agree with that?

10:03.503 --> 10:04.969
I'm concerned.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.771
I've always been a skeptic,
but after three years

10:07.773 --> 10:09.906
of seeing these things
constantly happen to you,

10:09.908 --> 10:12.443
it can't be explained
rationally.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.844
This is abnormal.

10:13.846 --> 10:15.112
Okay.
What are you experiencing?

10:15.114 --> 10:18.115
My experiences have been
more listening to everyone else

10:18.117 --> 10:19.850
bringing all these experiences
to me.

10:19.852 --> 10:21.519
Okay, so let's talk
about them.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.588
A bartender called
during an event,

10:24.590 --> 10:29.593
and a beer can flew at him
and smashed against the wall.

10:29.595 --> 10:32.596
He assumed, where else would it
come from but a customer?

10:32.598 --> 10:34.898
Right. I mean, was a customer
drinking that beer?

10:34.900 --> 10:37.334
There were no customers
drinking that beer,

10:37.336 --> 10:41.004
and we have security cameras,
so we reviewed the video

10:41.006 --> 10:42.539
and couldn't find
any indication

10:42.541 --> 10:44.608
that a customer
had thrown anything.

10:44.610 --> 10:47.745
Now, have you heard of any other
violence towards employees?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.946
Yeah. I've actually heard
of one employee

10:49.948 --> 10:52.616
being pulled backwards
down the stairs.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.884
So do you think that whatever's
here is capable of doing that?

10:54.886 --> 10:56.019
Well, apparently so.

10:56.021 --> 10:57.354
I wouldn't have thought that
three years ago,

10:57.356 --> 10:59.023
but it's happening
too often.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.357
Now, is there anything else
going on?

11:00.359 --> 11:02.559
It's just a lot of
bad luck --

11:02.561 --> 11:04.895
things breaking,
things going wrong.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.697
Alec mentioned
the bad luck to me.

11:06.699 --> 11:07.964
I feel like we're cursed.

11:07.966 --> 11:11.167
We even had a situation
where a food critic came in,

11:11.169 --> 11:13.236
and the water glass
just basically

11:13.238 --> 11:15.706
jumps off the tray
onto the critic.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.107
- Geez.
- Yep.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.175
Of all people, of course,
it spilled on him,

11:19.177 --> 11:22.512
and he actually did his review
on the radio later on.

11:22.514 --> 11:24.848
He'd said that they spilled
the pitcher of water on him,

11:24.850 --> 11:27.184
so that's not really
the publicity

11:27.186 --> 11:28.786
you want to get out
in the marketplace.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.388
What are you hoping
we can do for you guys?

11:31.390 --> 11:33.323
Well, I hope we can
solve the problem

11:33.325 --> 11:35.926
and most importantly
make it a safe environment.

11:35.928 --> 11:38.729
Restaurants generally are
a fairly dangerous environment.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.365
We've got hot grills.
We've got knives.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.133
We've got glass everywhere.

11:43.135 --> 11:45.936
It concerns me that
it could get even worse.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.675
There's a dead guy
wandering around.

11:51.677 --> 11:55.078
It looks like, to me, like he's
wearing a jester outfit

11:55.080 --> 11:56.579
but fancier.

11:56.581 --> 12:01.485
He's saying, "It's a fun
madhouse, this place."

12:04.223 --> 12:09.560
I feel like this guy --
he runs this place.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.428
This is his.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.697
Do you know how he might
interact with the living?

12:13.699 --> 12:17.634
He would be able to influence
perceptual experiences,

12:17.636 --> 12:21.105
manipulating them to see things
or hear things.

12:23.508 --> 12:24.708
Do you know
what sort of things

12:24.710 --> 12:26.910
he might make people
see and hear?

12:26.912 --> 12:32.048
Things that would embarrass
or humiliate that person.

12:32.050 --> 12:35.519
That's what really
makes him tick.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.721
If he could embarrass
or humiliate someone,

12:37.723 --> 12:39.522
he's going to do it.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.262
So, after talking
to Alec and Eddie,

12:45.264 --> 12:47.598
I wanted to see what
their employees had to say.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.400
A lot of times, I'll be
doing something in here,

12:50.402 --> 12:52.269
and I'll feel
somebody behind me,

12:52.271 --> 12:54.604
and I'll turn around,
and nothing will be there.

12:54.606 --> 12:56.339
And each one of them
had an experience

12:56.341 --> 12:58.341
more intense than the last.

12:58.343 --> 13:02.946
I came in at 8:00 a.m.,
and the first-aid kit was open,

13:02.948 --> 13:05.816
and everything was thrown
on the ground everywhere.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.351
I was the last person here.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.553
I saw a tall figure
in a long, blue robe,

13:09.555 --> 13:11.622
and I just bolted.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.623
When I was trying to go
up the stairs,

13:13.625 --> 13:16.160
I would reach over for
the handrail with my left hand.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.294
Every time,
it felt like something

13:17.296 --> 13:19.429
was pushing my hand away
from the handrail,

13:19.431 --> 13:21.365
and I would trip
on the first step.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.967
But what's got me the most
concerned is the violence.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.436
This does not seem to be
a safe place to work.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.639
I was on the landing
on the stairs,

13:28.641 --> 13:30.440
and I heard someone
behind me,

13:30.442 --> 13:32.376
and then I fell
down the stairs.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.911
I was scared,
and I was embarrassed,

13:33.913 --> 13:35.646
and I just got out of there.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.185
This jester dude --
he's making himself

13:41.187 --> 13:46.256
extremely physically present.

13:46.258 --> 13:51.461
This is something that
the living would experience,

13:51.463 --> 13:53.530
like,
physically hurting people --

13:53.532 --> 13:57.267
something as simple as pulling
a chair out from under somebody

13:57.269 --> 14:00.937
so that they fall
on their ass.

14:00.939 --> 14:04.141
It would make them feel
humiliated or embarrassed

14:04.143 --> 14:07.277
to getting more severe,

14:07.279 --> 14:10.947
doing something to cause
a physical injury.

14:10.949 --> 14:15.486
I'm seeing glass breaking
and cutting someone.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.955
The only way he really gets off
is, like,

14:17.957 --> 14:20.290
harming people,
manipulating them,

14:20.292 --> 14:22.292
and that's, like,
the only thing that really

14:22.294 --> 14:25.562
even remotely stimulates him.

14:25.564 --> 14:28.832
This is a very bad person.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.434
He's insane.

14:50.188 --> 14:51.520
If you're into celebrity chefs,

14:51.522 --> 14:54.256
then you know the name
Chris Montero.

14:54.258 --> 14:56.192
Now, he's a local here
and actually got his start

14:56.194 --> 14:58.194
working at Alec's restaurant.

14:58.196 --> 15:00.329
He says he knows all about
the history of Vessel,

15:00.331 --> 15:01.931
and it's a colorful one.

15:09.540 --> 15:10.940
Well, Chris,
it's good to meet you.

15:10.942 --> 15:13.009
On the phone, you mentioned
that my client's property

15:13.011 --> 15:13.876
had a crazy story.

15:13.878 --> 15:15.344
What can you tell me
about that?

15:15.346 --> 15:18.481
It was originally
a Lutheran church,

15:18.483 --> 15:21.150
and then sometime
in the early 1970s,

15:21.152 --> 15:22.618
a prominent
restaurant family

15:22.620 --> 15:24.687
known as the Galatoire family
purchased it

15:24.689 --> 15:28.490
and converted the old church
into a restaurant.

15:28.492 --> 15:30.025
It was called Christian's.

15:30.027 --> 15:32.094
I understand you actually
worked there, though.

15:32.096 --> 15:33.295
When was that?

15:33.297 --> 15:37.233
In the late 1980s,
I worked there for about a year.

15:37.235 --> 15:39.702
Okay, so obviously it's not
Christian's anymore.

15:39.704 --> 15:41.704
- Correct.
- Why'd it close down?

15:41.706 --> 15:43.238
Well, the restaurant itself

15:43.240 --> 15:47.309
had began to sort of wane
in popularity,

15:47.311 --> 15:49.178
and then
Hurricane Katrina hit.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.513
That was pretty much the end
of Christian's as a restaurant.

15:51.515 --> 15:54.049
Okay, so Katrina
was in '05, correct?

15:54.051 --> 15:56.185
- Correct.
- You were here for that?

15:56.187 --> 15:57.987
Absolutely.
Every minute, yeah.

15:57.989 --> 15:59.388
All right.
So what was that like?

15:59.390 --> 16:00.989
The scene was insane.

16:00.991 --> 16:04.192
I have some articles.
This one kind of sums it up.

16:04.194 --> 16:05.594
There was
no drinkable water.

16:05.596 --> 16:06.929
There was no gas
in the city,

16:06.931 --> 16:09.665
no electricity whatsoever,
and everything was flooded

16:09.667 --> 16:12.001
to varying degrees
throughout the city.

16:15.139 --> 16:18.274
Out here, it's different,

16:18.276 --> 16:21.143
and I'm, like, just hearing
people yelling and crying,

16:21.145 --> 16:27.349
and, I mean, it's, like,
a little bit of, like, a panic.

16:27.351 --> 16:29.485
There's so much chaos.

16:34.158 --> 16:38.094
There's pain and loss
and suffering,

16:38.096 --> 16:44.566
and so many people
are feeling so...

16:44.568 --> 16:48.504
like...just devastated.

16:52.377 --> 16:54.710
Okay, so the storm hits.
The restaurant's closed.

16:54.712 --> 16:55.711
What was
the neighborhood like?

16:55.713 --> 16:57.580
I mean,
paint a picture for me.

16:57.582 --> 17:01.450
We were at one of the
worst-affected flood zones.

17:01.452 --> 17:05.387
There was approximately
8 feet of water in the streets,

17:05.388 --> 17:08.457
and in Christian's case,
there was about 4 feet inside.

17:08.459 --> 17:09.925
So what happened?

17:09.926 --> 17:12.928
After the storm, Christian's was
used for a gathering place

17:12.930 --> 17:14.596
for people
who had been displaced,

17:14.598 --> 17:16.598
who had been through
the trauma of the storm.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.733
You have any idea
what the death toll

17:18.736 --> 17:20.469
was like
in your neighborhood,

17:20.471 --> 17:22.338
where my client's property is,
as well?

17:22.339 --> 17:23.872
There's a lot of
unknown there,

17:23.874 --> 17:26.208
but there was a really tragic
incident at a hospital

17:26.210 --> 17:28.077
that was within
short walking distance

17:28.079 --> 17:32.348
from Christian's restaurant
where they lost power,

17:32.350 --> 17:33.682
and as a result
of the flooding

17:33.684 --> 17:36.752
and the inability
to access the hospital,

17:36.754 --> 17:39.889
they lost 19 patients
that were intensive care.

17:39.891 --> 17:41.557
That's a lot.

17:41.559 --> 17:44.827
It's still abandoned,
and standing water, actually,

17:44.829 --> 17:46.828
in the basements
of the hospital today.

17:46.830 --> 17:49.298
- Still?
- Still today, yes.

17:52.103 --> 17:54.970
We're having a lot of sickness.

17:54.972 --> 17:58.040
That does not feel
very good at all.

17:58.042 --> 18:01.243
This is multiple people,

18:01.245 --> 18:04.113
and it's, like,
this horrible, horrible pain,

18:04.115 --> 18:06.115
and, like, ****.

18:09.587 --> 18:11.120
They're rolling people
in and out of here

18:11.122 --> 18:16.458
on, like, gurneys,
and they're carrying them.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.527
I think a lot of people
died here.

18:18.529 --> 18:21.263
It's so much pandemonium.

18:21.265 --> 18:23.933
I can't make sense of it.

18:23.935 --> 18:29.471
It feels like something
very important happened.

18:29.473 --> 18:31.340
I'm getting people
yelling and screaming.

18:31.342 --> 18:33.542
I'm getting a fight.

18:33.544 --> 18:35.010
What the **** is going on?

18:35.012 --> 18:36.878
It's like a little riot.

18:40.418 --> 18:46.222
It was a place
where sick people were.

18:46.224 --> 18:49.091
I think living people here
would feel sick,

18:49.093 --> 18:52.628
nauseous, panic again.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.363
There's so much chaos.

18:57.235 --> 19:00.236
The first thing I do when I get
to town is call the local cops.

19:00.238 --> 19:02.304
I just heard back
from a retired detective.

19:02.306 --> 19:04.507
Now, he says there was
a homicide

19:04.509 --> 19:07.109
right next to Alec's restaurant.

19:07.111 --> 19:08.444
He's pulling the files
for me now

19:08.446 --> 19:10.846
and says the case involves
a family dispute,

19:10.848 --> 19:12.981
deception, and insanity.

19:20.191 --> 19:21.790
So, Ronald, thanks for
looking into this case for me.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.659
When we spoke on the phone,
you said there was a murder

19:23.661 --> 19:25.628
a couple of doors down
from my client's property.

19:25.630 --> 19:26.862
What happened?

19:26.864 --> 19:29.565
September 5th, 1941,
gentleman by the name

19:29.567 --> 19:32.334
of Louis Reuter Sr.
was at work.

19:32.336 --> 19:35.470
He received a phone call
that there may be trouble

19:35.472 --> 19:36.872
at the house
with his son.

19:36.874 --> 19:37.907
What happened next?

19:37.909 --> 19:39.608
Louis Sr. goes over
to the residence

19:39.610 --> 19:42.812
where his son's at
with two coworkers.
Okay.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.147
As soon as Louis Sr.
arrives on the property,

19:45.149 --> 19:47.683
he sees his son,
Louis Reuter Jr.,

19:47.685 --> 19:49.285
armed with a handgun.

19:49.287 --> 19:50.685
Okay, so how old's
the kid?

19:50.687 --> 19:53.889
At the time of the shooting,
Junior was 24 years old.

19:53.891 --> 19:55.424
Okay, so what happened?

19:55.426 --> 19:57.893
Junior fires at him
multiple times.

19:57.895 --> 19:59.428
Okay, where's he hit him?

19:59.430 --> 20:02.731
He struck three times --
once in chest, twice in abdomen.

20:04.968 --> 20:07.436
All right, so out of nowhere,
this kid kills his own father.

20:07.438 --> 20:08.571
So what's the background
on this kid?

20:08.573 --> 20:10.306
I mean, any other issues?

20:10.308 --> 20:11.773
During the course
of the investigation,

20:11.775 --> 20:14.376
the police did learn that Junior
had actually been committed

20:14.378 --> 20:17.046
to an asylum
three separate times.

20:17.048 --> 20:18.647
- Kid's a nut-bag.
- Yes, sir.

20:18.649 --> 20:20.649
Another thing is that
Junior had been

20:20.651 --> 20:22.450
cut out of Senior's will.

20:22.452 --> 20:23.652
Okay, so he may be
a nut-bag,

20:23.654 --> 20:25.321
but he also may be pissed
about the money.

20:25.323 --> 20:26.388
Correct.

20:26.390 --> 20:27.456
So what kind of jail time
did he do?

20:27.458 --> 20:30.993
None. Because of
his mental capacity,

20:30.995 --> 20:33.061
the judge decided that
he couldn't tell the difference

20:33.063 --> 20:34.396
between right and wrong,

20:34.398 --> 20:36.731
so he ultimately
was sentenced to time

20:36.733 --> 20:38.333
in a mental-health facility,

20:38.335 --> 20:40.936
and it's not exactly clear how
long he actually spent there.

20:40.938 --> 20:43.004
So he could've did 5, 10 years
and then got out?

20:43.006 --> 20:44.540
Yes, sir.

20:48.613 --> 20:50.613
There's this young guy.

20:50.615 --> 20:53.149
He's so shy.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.684
He's all twisted up in his head.

20:55.686 --> 20:58.153
He's all twisted up inside.

20:58.155 --> 21:00.089
I think he's tied up
with regret.

21:00.091 --> 21:05.094
He's definitely not accepting
any responsibility

21:05.096 --> 21:07.162
for anything that's happened.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.634
And I'm getting a fight --

21:12.636 --> 21:16.372
horrible pain on the left side
of my stomach,

21:16.374 --> 21:19.575
so I can't tell if
it's a stabbing or a handgun.

21:19.577 --> 21:22.978
This was one man on another man.

21:29.586 --> 21:31.586

and we'll help if we can.

21:54.344 --> 21:56.610
So far, I've got clients
worried about the safety

21:56.612 --> 21:59.280
of their employees
and guests on a property

21:59.282 --> 22:01.482
that was at the heart
of Hurricane Katrina

22:01.484 --> 22:04.084
where nearly
2,000 people died,

22:04.086 --> 22:07.688
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

22:07.690 --> 22:08.689
Looking through old records,

22:08.691 --> 22:10.424
I find one of
the original owners

22:10.426 --> 22:12.226
of Alec and Eddie's property

22:12.228 --> 22:16.630
was a wealthy baroness
with a lot of legal troubles.

22:16.632 --> 22:18.298
I got to know more
about this baroness,

22:18.300 --> 22:20.768
so I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian.

22:20.770 --> 22:23.236
Now, she said the woman's story
is so wild,

22:23.238 --> 22:26.640
it would make a great movie,
if anyone could even believe it.

22:32.982 --> 22:34.382
So, Diana,
on the phone you mentioned

22:34.384 --> 22:36.917
that this baroness
had a pretty wild story.

22:36.919 --> 22:38.719
What do you know
about her?

22:38.721 --> 22:41.989
So this is
Micaela Almonester.

22:41.991 --> 22:45.192
She was born here
in New Orleans in 1795,

22:45.194 --> 22:47.527
and she was heir
to the Almonester fortune,

22:47.529 --> 22:49.463
and the fortune
that she inherited

22:49.465 --> 22:52.600
also included the property
which you are investigating.

22:52.602 --> 22:58.672
At 16, she was married
with her cousin.

22:58.674 --> 23:01.542
Very shortly after that,
they moved to France.

23:01.544 --> 23:03.143
That's where the trouble
started.

23:03.145 --> 23:04.678
Okay, so what are we
talking about?

23:04.680 --> 23:06.147
What kind of trouble?

23:06.149 --> 23:10.284
Her mother had arranged that
she would come into the marriage

23:10.286 --> 23:12.686
maintaining control
of half of her fortune,

23:12.688 --> 23:16.824
and this enraged her
father-in-law, Joseph Pontalba.

23:16.826 --> 23:21.628
He spent the rest of his life
trying to extort the other half.

23:21.630 --> 23:23.030
How's he go about that?

23:23.032 --> 23:24.832
So, he begins with litigation

23:24.834 --> 23:28.636
and filed lawsuits against her
trying to seize that money.

23:28.638 --> 23:30.037
Is he trying to
get the property

23:30.039 --> 23:32.706
where my clients
have their place now?

23:32.708 --> 23:36.243
Yes. Actually, the property
would've been the most valuable

23:36.245 --> 23:39.313
because he would've been able to
collect rents on that property.

23:39.315 --> 23:41.115
Okay.
Is he successful at all?

23:41.117 --> 23:44.117
No. She was
an incredible fighter

23:44.119 --> 23:47.054
and won the lawsuits
that were taken up against her.

23:47.056 --> 23:49.390
All right, so the father-in-law
had to be pissed.

23:49.392 --> 23:50.658
Absolutely.

23:50.660 --> 23:53.327
That's when things
get really ugly.

23:53.329 --> 23:57.398
They lock her in the chateau
for two years,

23:57.400 --> 24:00.400
so she's basically
put in solitary confinement.

24:00.402 --> 24:02.202
Does the husband step in
at all and stop it?

24:02.204 --> 24:03.337
No.

24:03.339 --> 24:07.675
He is very much under the thumb
of his father

24:07.677 --> 24:09.943
and too weak-willed
to protect her.

24:09.945 --> 24:11.679
So this guy is basically
a noodle.

24:11.681 --> 24:13.080
Yeah.
He's a bit of a weenie.

24:13.082 --> 24:16.416
All right, so she's stuck there
for two years.

24:16.418 --> 24:17.751
What happens?

24:17.753 --> 24:21.621
Joseph becomes so frustrated,
so enraged, he snaps.

24:21.623 --> 24:25.559
In 1834, he bursts
into her bedchamber

24:25.561 --> 24:28.696
and shoots her
at point-blank range,

24:28.698 --> 24:29.964
nips an artery.

24:29.966 --> 24:31.698
She's oozing blood.

24:31.700 --> 24:35.302
Joseph, thinking she's dead,
goes into his study,

24:35.304 --> 24:38.372
reloads the pistols,
turns them on himself,

24:38.374 --> 24:39.907
and shoots himself
in the head.

24:39.909 --> 24:41.509
And does she die
from this?

24:41.511 --> 24:43.043
No, she does not.

24:43.045 --> 24:44.979
So this is
a really tough woman.
Yes.

24:44.981 --> 24:46.714
Okay, the father-in-law
is dead.

24:46.716 --> 24:49.049
She survives.
What does she do next?

24:49.051 --> 24:50.985
Her next move is
to come back

24:50.987 --> 24:52.720
to what is now
the United States.

24:52.722 --> 24:54.788
She was able to procure
a divorce,

24:54.790 --> 24:57.725
and she's finally able
to regain control

24:57.727 --> 25:00.127
of what she wanted
from the beginning

25:00.129 --> 25:03.397
which was her half
of her fortune.

25:03.399 --> 25:04.999
Okay, so how old is she
when she dies?

25:05.001 --> 25:06.333
78.

25:06.335 --> 25:08.068
Okay, so she lived
a pretty long life.

25:08.070 --> 25:10.537
Especially with shrapnel
in her chest.

25:10.539 --> 25:12.139
Okay, so her remains
brought back here

25:12.141 --> 25:13.207
and buried in New Orleans?

25:13.209 --> 25:15.675
No.
She is buried in France

25:15.677 --> 25:19.213
in a family mausoleum
much like one of these...
Okay.

25:19.215 --> 25:23.083
...right next to her husband
and her father-in-law.

25:23.085 --> 25:25.553
Let me get this straight.
She spends her entire adult life

25:25.555 --> 25:27.154
trying to get away
from these two men,

25:27.156 --> 25:28.622
and now she's buried
with them?

25:28.624 --> 25:30.424
Yes, she is.

25:30.426 --> 25:33.560
I suppose in death,
all is forgiven.

25:36.899 --> 25:40.233
I'm seeing that lady
in red again.

25:40.235 --> 25:41.968
Do you get anything
on who she was in life?

25:41.970 --> 25:46.707
She is from a long time ago --
1840s or earlier.

25:46.709 --> 25:49.309
I think, like,
she came from money.

25:49.311 --> 25:52.713
At one point, she was married.

25:52.715 --> 25:55.783
And then something happened.

25:55.785 --> 26:00.054
She told me when we came in here
that she came here for safety.

26:03.326 --> 26:09.997
Something with this woman in red
went really bad,

26:09.999 --> 26:12.866
and this is where she ran.

26:12.868 --> 26:16.603
There's some connection
between her and the jester guy,

26:16.605 --> 26:20.074
so I think she had some
really bad experiences with him.

26:20.076 --> 26:25.346
I just think, boy, he did
some really, really bad things.

26:25.348 --> 26:29.016
She says, "Do not trust men
because they are bad,

26:29.018 --> 26:31.418
and they will hurt you
and/or kill you."

26:39.428 --> 26:41.962
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk,

26:41.964 --> 26:45.632
but two stood out --
first, the jester.

26:45.634 --> 26:50.504
He was thin,
very, very pale.

26:50.506 --> 26:54.241
He had a very long face.

26:54.243 --> 26:56.510
Next, I describe the lady in red

26:56.512 --> 26:59.580
and the tall, shadowy things
by her side.

26:59.582 --> 27:01.982
She's a big, bigger lady.

27:01.984 --> 27:04.451
And then there's, like,
this really super-light

27:04.453 --> 27:06.987
haze around her,

27:06.989 --> 27:09.522
but it has the sleeves
that come down.

27:17.466 --> 27:21.001
Amy, is this
what you saw?

27:21.003 --> 27:22.936
Yes.
That's what I saw.

27:49.464 --> 27:52.465
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:52.467 --> 27:54.668
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:54.670 --> 27:57.670
and our clients
for the first time.

27:57.672 --> 27:59.005
So, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Alec

27:59.007 --> 28:01.341
and his business partner,
Eddie.

28:01.343 --> 28:05.011
Believe it or not, these guys
bought this place sight unseen.

28:05.013 --> 28:08.348
They busted their asses making
it their dream restaurant,

28:08.350 --> 28:09.682
but since they got here,

28:09.684 --> 28:13.486
activity has been violent
and nonstop.

28:13.488 --> 28:14.554
They're convinced
their customers

28:14.556 --> 28:16.089
and employees
are in danger,

28:16.091 --> 28:20.226
and whatever's here is dead set
on running them out of business.

28:20.228 --> 28:21.628
So now that Amy knows
who you guys are

28:21.630 --> 28:22.895
and what's going on here,

28:22.897 --> 28:24.998
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

28:28.770 --> 28:33.973
So, outside, the residual energy
is extremely heavy,

28:33.975 --> 28:37.243
and it's filled
with sadness.

28:37.245 --> 28:39.579
What I was seeing was
a ton of people

28:39.581 --> 28:44.250
running around in a panic,
yelling and crying nonstop.

28:44.252 --> 28:49.121
I also got a lot of illness,
was feeling nauseous,

28:49.123 --> 28:52.458
and had a lot of
trouble breathing.

28:52.460 --> 28:55.662
I was seeing
people on gurneys,

28:55.664 --> 28:59.932
so what I assumed was that many
people would have died here.

28:59.934 --> 29:04.737
The entire atmosphere outside
is extremely chaotic

29:04.739 --> 29:07.340
and just,
like, pandemonium.

29:07.342 --> 29:09.609
Okay.
When I go out there,

29:09.611 --> 29:14.748
I feel this --
exactly what you described.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.215
You just want to throw up.

29:16.217 --> 29:17.950
You're just like, "God,
I can't deal with this anymore."

29:17.952 --> 29:19.552
So for Amy, I want to give her
a little history

29:19.554 --> 29:20.754
about the building.
Okay.

29:20.756 --> 29:22.688
Obviously, this wasn't
always a restaurant.

29:22.690 --> 29:24.758
It was a Lutheran church
for over 50 years.

29:24.760 --> 29:29.629
In 1977, it became a popular
restaurant called Christian's,

29:29.631 --> 29:33.299
but on August 28th, 2005,
everyone had to evacuate here

29:33.301 --> 29:35.835
because Hurricane Katrina
was moving in.

29:35.837 --> 29:37.037
Ohhhh.

29:37.039 --> 29:38.772
As you know, the devastation
from that storm

29:38.774 --> 29:40.840
was unprecedented,

29:40.842 --> 29:44.644
and at its worst, this room
was 4 feet under water.

29:44.646 --> 29:46.713
****

29:46.715 --> 29:48.714
Now, something you mentioned
really caught my attention.

29:48.716 --> 29:50.716
You mentioned gurneys

29:50.718 --> 29:53.052
and a place where
sick people were.

29:53.054 --> 29:55.188
Well, there's an old hospital
about 200 yards...

29:55.190 --> 29:57.590
...down the block from here.

29:57.592 --> 30:00.794
Unfortunately, they weren't able
to evacuate all the patients.

30:00.796 --> 30:04.130
Between the rising waters
and electrical-power outages,

30:04.132 --> 30:06.533
it resulted
in 19 people dying.

30:06.535 --> 30:08.067
The hospital never reopened.

30:08.069 --> 30:10.669
As for this building,
it became a gathering place

30:10.671 --> 30:15.075
for people to worship and deal
with the aftermath of the storm.

30:21.683 --> 30:24.884
Okay. Now, here
I encountered

30:24.886 --> 30:27.487
an individual
that did concern me.

30:27.489 --> 30:29.355
It's a male.

30:29.357 --> 30:33.626
He was dressed strangely.

30:33.628 --> 30:35.295
The best way
I can describe it

30:35.297 --> 30:39.432
is kind of as a jester
but fancier.

30:39.434 --> 30:42.235
He was from
quite some time ago --

30:42.237 --> 30:44.770
I would say, like, 1820s.

30:44.772 --> 30:46.506
I don't like
this person at all.

30:46.508 --> 30:48.908
I felt like he was the owner,
and he still feels like

30:48.910 --> 30:52.111
he's the owner
of this place.

30:52.113 --> 30:56.115
And my concern
for people here

30:56.117 --> 31:00.786
is that this individual
is completely insane.

31:00.788 --> 31:03.923
He can make the living
see and hear things

31:03.925 --> 31:05.992
that aren't
necessarily there.

31:05.994 --> 31:08.127
He's extremely present.

31:08.129 --> 31:10.663
Living people
might see him.

31:10.665 --> 31:12.398
Right after we started
working in here,

31:12.400 --> 31:15.868
I would see something like
a shadow, a monk apparition,

31:15.870 --> 31:18.470
over in this area,
and it was constant.

31:18.472 --> 31:21.207
I thought I was crazy,
but it happened a lot.

31:21.209 --> 31:26.546
His focus would be on,
like, females.

31:26.548 --> 31:29.682
One of the things
I saw him doing potentially

31:29.684 --> 31:31.217
was pulling a chair out

31:31.219 --> 31:33.619
so somebody would fall
on their ass.

31:33.621 --> 31:36.689
When we first opened,
somebody sat down on a chair,

31:36.691 --> 31:38.424
and it was like
they were pushed over.

31:38.426 --> 31:40.826
The whole chair was right
over here on the ground.

31:40.828 --> 31:42.895
- She falls flat on the floor...
- Flat on the floor.

31:42.897 --> 31:44.196
...has to be taken away
on a stretcher.

31:44.198 --> 31:45.364
Man.

31:45.366 --> 31:49.235
He likes to embarrass,
and he likes to humiliate.

31:49.237 --> 31:52.171
He is definitely
a psychopath.

31:52.173 --> 31:54.307
Talk about the glass of water
with the critic.

31:54.309 --> 31:55.642
I knew
that was gonna come up

31:55.644 --> 31:57.309
because when you say
"embarrassed,"

31:57.311 --> 31:59.645
we even had an incident
where we had a warning

31:59.647 --> 32:01.047
the food critic
was coming in,

32:01.049 --> 32:04.384
so whatever you do, make sure
it's perfect, perfect.

32:04.386 --> 32:07.920
And the glass of water just goes
ka-plump on top of the critic.

32:07.922 --> 32:09.855
I mean, what could be
more embarrassing

32:09.857 --> 32:13.659
than dumping water
on a food critic?
Right.

32:13.661 --> 32:16.329
Now, Amy, you said
this guy was a psychopath.

32:16.331 --> 32:17.863
Tell her what happened
with the burners.

32:17.865 --> 32:19.199
There's a checklist.

32:19.201 --> 32:21.267
Every night when they leave,
they make sure the gas is off,

32:21.269 --> 32:23.002
the burners are off,
the hood's off.

32:23.004 --> 32:24.137
We come in.

32:24.139 --> 32:27.339
Every single burner
on the cooktop is on.

32:27.341 --> 32:29.408
The chef had turned them
all off.

32:29.410 --> 32:31.010
This is bad.

32:31.012 --> 32:33.413
I did have a sketch done.

32:44.359 --> 32:45.825
That's interesting.

32:49.164 --> 32:51.430
My God.

32:51.432 --> 32:54.167
So this is the guy
that's causing the problems...
Yes.

32:54.169 --> 32:56.035
...wants to hurt,
wants to embarrass.

32:56.037 --> 32:57.770
Yes. Like, he likes
to humiliate.

32:57.772 --> 32:59.772
He likes to make people
feel uncomfortable.

32:59.774 --> 33:01.640
He likes to hurt.

33:07.548 --> 33:10.449
Anything else?

33:10.451 --> 33:13.719
Another dead person that
I encountered was a female.

33:13.721 --> 33:16.723
She's the one
I'm the most worried about.

33:16.725 --> 33:20.326
She was dressed completely
in red from head to toe,

33:20.328 --> 33:25.231
and I felt maybe 1840s,
maybe earlier,

33:25.233 --> 33:27.066
came from a lot of money,

33:27.068 --> 33:30.602
but I think that
she may have lost it.

33:30.604 --> 33:32.538
She had been married,

33:32.540 --> 33:35.541
and then she said
something really bad happened

33:35.543 --> 33:39.412
and changed her
significantly.

33:39.414 --> 33:42.281
She was telling me,
"Don't trust men

33:42.283 --> 33:45.217
because they will hurt you.
They will kill you."

33:45.219 --> 33:47.953
She said that she had to
come here for safety

33:47.955 --> 33:52.225
because she was escaping men --
bad men that were after her.

33:52.227 --> 33:56.095
One of those men
may have murdered her.

33:56.097 --> 33:58.364
I do know for a fact
that someone tried

33:58.366 --> 33:59.765
to make her disappear.

33:59.767 --> 34:03.102
Amy just hit on just about
everything that makes me think

34:03.104 --> 34:05.438
of one of the original owners
of the property.

34:05.440 --> 34:09.308
Her name was
Baroness Micaela Pontalba.

34:09.310 --> 34:13.246
She was born in New Orleans
in 1795 to a filthy-rich family.

34:13.248 --> 34:16.783
Micaela became the sole heir
to a massive fortune.

34:16.784 --> 34:19.385
That fortune included
this property.

34:19.387 --> 34:20.585
Geez.

34:20.588 --> 34:23.188
When she was 16, she got
involved in an arranged marriage

34:23.190 --> 34:26.192
to her French cousin,
Celestin Pontalba,

34:26.194 --> 34:29.061
and this is a portrait
of him right here.

34:29.063 --> 34:30.463
A short time after
they married,

34:30.465 --> 34:33.399
they went to live
with his family in Paris.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.068
Now, when she got married,
her family

34:35.070 --> 34:39.004
gave the husband's family
half of her fortune as a dowry.

34:39.005 --> 34:41.739
That wasn't good enough
for her father-in-law,

34:41.742 --> 34:44.143
Baron Joseph Pontalba.

34:44.145 --> 34:48.547
Joseph felt like he was
entitled to all the money.

34:48.549 --> 34:50.681
He spent the rest of his life
torturing her,

34:50.684 --> 34:52.752
trying to get every penny.

34:52.754 --> 34:54.553
Her husband was
such a noodle

34:54.554 --> 34:56.688
that he just let his father
get away with it.

34:56.690 --> 34:59.358
Now, you mentioned someone made
the woman you saw disappear.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.294
Well, her father-in-law,
Joseph,

35:01.296 --> 35:03.896
locked her up in a chateau
for two full years.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.100
She still wouldn't give up
her money, though.

35:07.102 --> 35:09.902
I mean, she was a tough,
tough woman.

35:09.904 --> 35:11.170
Now, you said the woman
you saw

35:11.172 --> 35:12.505
might have been murdered
by a man.

35:12.507 --> 35:14.440
Well, that almost happened.

35:14.442 --> 35:16.776
Her father-in-law was
so pissed

35:16.778 --> 35:19.378
he couldn't get her money
that he snapped.

35:19.380 --> 35:22.248
One morning in 1834,
he busted into her bedroom

35:22.250 --> 35:24.650
and shot her three times
at point-blank range.

35:24.652 --> 35:26.652
- My God.
- What the ****?

35:26.654 --> 35:28.321
Yeah.
The father-in-law panicked,

35:28.323 --> 35:30.590
and he shoots himself
in the head.

35:30.592 --> 35:33.326
Unbelievably, she lives.

35:33.328 --> 35:38.330
She comes back to New Orleans
and files for divorce.

35:38.332 --> 35:42.268
This is how she looked
during her portrait.

35:42.270 --> 35:45.337
Is it possible that this
baroness is the woman you saw?

35:45.339 --> 35:48.207
Yeah. Her face looks
just like the face

35:48.209 --> 35:51.543
of the woman
that I encountered.

35:51.545 --> 35:53.479
It really makes sense.

35:53.481 --> 35:55.147
Now, I was also able
to get a picture

35:55.149 --> 35:57.750
of her father-in-law,
Joseph Pontalba.

35:57.752 --> 35:59.352
This is him here.

36:03.358 --> 36:06.959
My God.
It looks like this guy.

36:11.766 --> 36:13.499
You know what?
I agree with Alec.

36:13.501 --> 36:14.967
Could he be the jester?

36:14.969 --> 36:17.570
I think it's possible
because, yeah,

36:17.572 --> 36:20.373
his mouth did do
that weird curlicue thing.

36:20.375 --> 36:22.374
He does sort of have
a little bit of a smirk.

36:22.376 --> 36:24.911
Yeah, with the mouth,
yeah.

36:24.913 --> 36:26.378
So, now, this lady in red --

36:26.380 --> 36:27.980
would they have experiences
with her?

36:27.982 --> 36:31.717
Yes. She's very present
and very physical.

36:31.719 --> 36:34.387
She wrapped
her left arm around me,

36:34.389 --> 36:38.324
and she sent ice-cold chills
through my body.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.926
There's an area
on the stairwell.

36:39.928 --> 36:42.595
There is absolutely no air vents
there, and all of the sudden,

36:42.597 --> 36:47.266
there's this whisk of cold,
freezing air in that area.

36:47.268 --> 36:50.536
She hates men,
considers them a threat.

36:50.538 --> 36:54.206
She may hit, punch,
pull hair, push them,

36:54.208 --> 36:56.342
anything to get them
away from her.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.543
Eddie, you talked about
an employee

36:57.545 --> 36:58.811
who was pushed down
the stairs, right?

36:58.813 --> 37:00.679
- Right.
- Tell Amy about that.

37:00.681 --> 37:01.881
He just tripped
for no reason.

37:01.883 --> 37:05.751
Like, somebody grabbed
his ankle, and he tripped.

37:05.753 --> 37:09.087
One of the most concerning
things about her

37:09.089 --> 37:14.693
is that she has
some shadow beings with her.

37:14.695 --> 37:19.498
She wanted to work with them
to get rid of people.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.366
Your employees see
shadow figures, right?

37:21.368 --> 37:23.035
Yes, very often.

37:23.037 --> 37:26.438
Do they tell you what
the shadow figures look like?

37:26.440 --> 37:28.174
I had a sketch done.

37:28.176 --> 37:29.842
Of these shadow things?

37:29.844 --> 37:31.711
Yes.

37:43.791 --> 37:45.458
My gosh.

37:49.463 --> 37:50.463
Now, was it you
that got touched

37:50.465 --> 37:51.597
on the back of the neck,
or was it...

37:51.599 --> 37:53.866
Many times
in the small office.

37:53.868 --> 37:55.268
Many times that happened.

37:55.270 --> 37:57.803
She wants people gone.
Yes.

37:57.805 --> 38:00.272
She's doing a good job of it,
that's for sure --

38:00.274 --> 38:03.142
a really good job.

38:03.144 --> 38:06.278
So the reason we're doing
a daytime reveal

38:06.280 --> 38:07.613
is because these guys
are getting ready

38:07.615 --> 38:09.415
to open up the restaurant
in about an hour.

38:09.417 --> 38:12.485
I mean, is it really
a safe thing to do?

38:12.487 --> 38:16.422
I don't know
because these shadow entities

38:16.424 --> 38:18.490
were never human.

38:18.492 --> 38:20.760
The baroness --
she doesn't understand

38:20.762 --> 38:22.695
what she's working with here.

38:22.697 --> 38:27.232
Whatever she's doing will
potentially make them go rogue,

38:27.234 --> 38:29.902
give them kind of
more of a consciousness,

38:29.904 --> 38:31.571
and it could become
very serious

38:31.573 --> 38:35.374
and very destructive
and out of her hands.

38:35.376 --> 38:38.711
So what happens if these
shadow figures get a conscious?

38:38.713 --> 38:39.978
What could happen here?

38:39.980 --> 38:44.049
Well, then they will function
as independent entities,

38:44.051 --> 38:47.086
and then it'll just
be destruction and mayhem.

38:49.456 --> 38:51.524
My God.

39:09.409 --> 39:12.010
Alec and Eddie, I'm glad
you called us in when you did.

39:12.012 --> 39:15.213
You got a lot going on in here,
and it's obviously dangerous.

39:15.215 --> 39:17.081
It's time to answer
the big question --

39:17.083 --> 39:19.350
is there any way to stop
the violent activity

39:19.352 --> 39:21.552
so that you can make
this place safe

39:21.554 --> 39:25.356
and save the business that you
obviously care about so much?

39:25.358 --> 39:27.625
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:29.829 --> 39:35.032
I believe
that you can stay.

39:35.034 --> 39:40.371
But you're going to have to do
a lot of steps initially.

39:40.373 --> 39:41.706
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:41.708 --> 39:45.843
The first thing is to take care
of the jester, the torturer,

39:45.845 --> 39:49.980
so I would like a male
who's a physical medium

39:49.982 --> 39:53.718
who is very big, very strong,
and very assertive

39:53.720 --> 39:58.656
who will put him in his place
and will then remove him.

39:58.658 --> 40:01.525
The following week,
bring in now

40:01.527 --> 40:04.462
a very strong
female medium

40:04.464 --> 40:08.333
to come in
and remove her.

40:08.335 --> 40:12.736
Now, as far as
the shadow entities,

40:12.738 --> 40:17.475
they will move outside,
and she will take care of them.

40:17.477 --> 40:18.809
So when the baroness goes,

40:18.811 --> 40:20.744
the shadow things
go with her?

40:20.746 --> 40:22.079
Correct.

40:22.081 --> 40:24.148
Once you get rid of them,
then, hopefully,

40:24.150 --> 40:26.818
your employees won't be harassed
or afraid to come to work.

40:28.088 --> 40:31.756
You won't have critics
getting water spilt on them.

40:31.758 --> 40:34.892
Now, for the patio,
that's a lot of residual

40:34.894 --> 40:37.161
that has to be dealt with,

40:37.163 --> 40:40.431
so the first thing is
to bring in a psychic

40:40.433 --> 40:43.367
who will show you how
to do a proper cleansing.

40:43.369 --> 40:47.438
They're going to remove
as much residual

40:47.440 --> 40:52.042
as they can
out of that patio space.

40:52.044 --> 40:53.511
Okay.

40:53.513 --> 40:57.648
And also then have that same
individual do a proper blocking.

40:57.650 --> 41:00.785
What they're gonna do
is put up a barrier

41:00.787 --> 41:04.989
to prevent anything
from coming back in there.

41:04.991 --> 41:06.524
So with all this
being done --

41:06.526 --> 41:07.925
let's say it's all
said and done.

41:07.927 --> 41:10.261
They shouldn't have any more
dangerous problems here

41:10.263 --> 41:11.595
when it comes
to the paranormal.

41:11.597 --> 41:16.667
You are in a very active
location regardless,

41:16.669 --> 41:20.738
and so you're going to
have things come and go,

41:20.740 --> 41:23.474
but it won't be this bad.

41:23.476 --> 41:25.142
Are you -- you're willing
to do all this stuff.

41:25.144 --> 41:26.411
- Of course, of course.
- Okay.

41:26.413 --> 41:29.013
- I mean, we have no choice.
- You have to do it.

41:29.015 --> 41:31.282
You have to have an outlook
for a solution.

41:31.284 --> 41:33.217
You can't keep going down
the same path

41:33.219 --> 41:34.752
that's not working, right?

41:34.754 --> 41:37.354
But we have
a great opportunity.

41:37.356 --> 41:40.358
It's like a ton of bricks
has been lifted off us.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.959
It's pretty amazing.

41:41.961 --> 41:45.763
- Thank you both.
- Thank you.

41:45.765 --> 41:48.565
I really hope
Alec and Eddie follow my advice.

41:48.567 --> 41:51.235
If they do, they can continue
running the restaurant

41:51.237 --> 41:54.238
they love so much,
and more importantly,

41:54.240 --> 41:57.575
their employees and guests
will be safe from harm.

42:01.380 --> 42:04.449
We wanted to give you an update
on what has been going on

42:04.451 --> 42:06.850
since Amy and Steve
came to Vessel.

42:06.852 --> 42:11.188
Before they came, every single
day was a challenge for us.

42:11.190 --> 42:12.390
After meeting with them,

42:12.392 --> 42:15.326
everything became really
so clear and made sense.

42:15.328 --> 42:16.727
We followed Amy
and Steve's advice,

42:16.729 --> 42:18.930
and we're still looking
for one more medium

42:18.932 --> 42:20.731
and have some good leads
and are confident

42:20.733 --> 42:22.467
we'll have somebody
really, really soon.

42:22.469 --> 42:24.936
We're grateful to Amy and Steve
for all their help.

42:24.938 --> 42:27.204
Things are really
looking up,

42:27.206 --> 42:28.873
and we really feel like
we have a bright future now.
