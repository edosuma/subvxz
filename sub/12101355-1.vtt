Copy that. Over and out.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.022
You gotta get these hinges
greased, Mick. Come on!

01:06.196 --> 01:07.763
MICK: The grease
isn't the problem.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.417
-It's the hinge.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.897
This is a creaky old dinosaur.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.378
This old girl shoulda
been retired 10 years ago.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.076
Yeah?

01:16.250 --> 01:18.469
Yeah, well, they should have
retired me 10 years ago.

01:18.643 --> 01:19.731
MICK: Not you, Charlie.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.385
You're in your prime.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.561
I should know
'cause we're the same age,

01:23.735 --> 01:25.041
and I'm in my prime.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.611
MICK: Hey,
is that coffee still hot?

01:29.785 --> 01:31.178
Yeah, it's hot enough.

01:31.352 --> 01:33.397
MICK: All right, then.
Could you do me a favor?

01:36.357 --> 01:39.447
You ever thought about, uh,
buying a coffeemaker?

01:39.621 --> 01:40.970
MICK: Coffeemaker?

01:41.144 --> 01:44.234
You know, one that's got
that milk froster thing?

01:44.408 --> 01:46.236
MICK: Oh, yeah.
Frother. I got ya.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.325
Yeah. That way,
then you can, uh...

01:48.499 --> 01:49.761

01:51.676 --> 01:53.113
MICK: Ugh, God damn!

01:53.287 --> 01:55.550
Hey, I thought you said
this coffee was hot.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.029
CHARLIE: What is this?

01:57.204 --> 01:59.119
Dude, it's typical.
What's our time?

01:59.293 --> 02:00.729
MICK: I don't know,

02:00.903 --> 02:02.296
but this truck needs
to get movin'.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.385

02:06.735 --> 02:07.953

specialize in armed guard

06:05.974 --> 06:08.411
cash pickup trucks
and deliveries across LA.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.805
Our clients are made up of

06:10.979 --> 06:12.284
large-scale
retail department stores,

06:12.459 --> 06:14.504
marijuana dispensaries,
cash vaults,

06:14.678 --> 06:16.593
casinos, private banks.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.639
Could I get
another one? Thank you.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.380
We're not federal.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.512
We're essentially middlemen.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.385
Hundreds of millions shifting
through here every week.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.735
We got 12 trucks,
two or three guards in each.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.998
A driver, a messenger,
and a guard,

06:30.172 --> 06:33.262
each moving up to 15 mil
a day, and sometimes more,

06:33.436 --> 06:35.743
which can attract
unwanted attention.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.049
I won't lie.
It can be dangerous,

06:38.223 --> 06:39.616
which is why
we train you properly

06:39.790 --> 06:41.618
and pay the premium rates,

06:41.792 --> 06:43.533
so we can all
sleep better at night.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.143
Thanks.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.710
Now, your background checks
came back fine,

06:46.884 --> 06:48.190
and your reference from

06:48.364 --> 06:49.713
Orange Delta Security
was impressive.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.323
That was a good company.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.369
I'm sorry to hear
it went bust.

06:53.674 --> 06:54.588
Family?

06:54.762 --> 06:56.720
Married. Divorced.

06:56.894 --> 06:57.982
No one else?

06:58.722 --> 06:59.723
No.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.335
Good. Stay focused. I like it.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.120
But just so you know,

07:05.294 --> 07:07.862
we lost a couple of guards
a while back.

07:08.036 --> 07:10.168
Killed on the job.
A civilian, too.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.910
A fuckin' tragedy,

07:13.084 --> 07:15.696
and they still haven't found
the scum who did it.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.349
And that's why
we've upped our game.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.177
Sixty hours
of firearms training.

07:19.351 --> 07:22.006
MAN 2: Patrick?
Are you Patrick Hill?

07:22.659 --> 07:24.139
No, please. Don't get up.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.619
Good to meet you.

07:25.793 --> 07:28.273
Let's see. Hill... Hill...

07:28.448 --> 07:31.668
H. I'm gonna call you H,
if that's okay?

07:31.842 --> 07:34.105
They call me Bullet,
which is ironic

07:34.279 --> 07:36.151
because I certainly
don't move like one.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.282
You ready for target practice?

07:37.457 --> 07:38.849
Ready.

07:39.023 --> 07:41.156
I saw you had
your pistol license already.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.854
So, this is the pre-assignment
training course.

07:44.028 --> 07:45.334
We got eight hours together,

07:45.508 --> 07:47.510
popping cans
off walls and the like.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.947
You need to hit
the 70% pass mark.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.949
There's some fitness
which, by the looks of it,

07:52.123 --> 07:53.647
shouldn't be
a problem for you.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.692
We just need to see
how you are under pressure.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.302
Shall we get started?

07:57.477 --> 07:58.608
Whatever you say, Bullet.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.629
Well, that's
quite enough of that.

08:33.338 --> 08:34.688
Been a while, huh?

08:35.732 --> 08:37.517
Little practice,
I'm sure you'll get there.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Too far! Too far!

08:51.705 --> 08:53.837
Pull up a little. Pull it up.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.019
Look at that.

09:03.064 --> 09:04.544
70%.

09:04.718 --> 09:05.980
Just slipped in.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.373
Any less,
we'd be doing this again.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.072
You won't be joining
a Formula 1 team anytime soon,

09:11.246 --> 09:13.378
but you'll do for this job.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.858
Let's get you suited.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.295
How many we got coming?

09:19.080 --> 09:20.429
In that case,
I'll get three pounds of ribs

09:20.603 --> 09:21.735
and a bucket of wings
for the kids.

09:21.909 --> 09:22.910
Cough up, Bullet.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.041
Dude, I'm on the phone.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.477
I don't care. $30.

09:25.652 --> 09:26.740
-How much?
-30 bucks.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.393
Wait for it, wait for it.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.960
-Change?
-Suplex!

09:30.134 --> 09:31.962
-I want that money.
-There you go, buddy.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.790
Give me that dollar dollar.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.531
-WOMAN: Forty-one.
-Incoming. Thank you.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.272
Forty-two's not gonna beat me.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.274
-Fuck off, Dana.
-SHIRLEY: Come on.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.493
You're not supposed to be
in here anyway.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.017
No, I think it's you

09:43.191 --> 09:44.627
who's in the wrong
changing room, Stuart.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.542
SHIRLEY: Come on.
Let's look lively, people.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.631
Chop-chop, Goose.
Show me your money.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.461
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a new addition.

09:52.635 --> 09:53.505
DANA: Here you go, Shirley.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.420
May I introduce H.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.293
Oh, she'll do.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.077
Put him down, Dana.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.863
Come on.
I'll show you your locker.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.473
This one's yours.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.346
-You good?
-Yeah.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.348
Why, don't I look it?

10:10.522 --> 10:14.309
No, buddy, you look like
a shrink-wrapped Rolls-Royce,

10:14.483 --> 10:16.790
in contrast to this car crash.

10:16.964 --> 10:20.228
Meet Hollow Bob
and Boy Sweat Dave.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.012
You look like
you could do some pull-ups.

10:22.186 --> 10:24.145
I'll put a 50
on you beatin' Boy Sweat here.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.538
What's the matter with him?
He looks good for it.

10:26.713 --> 10:27.888
Yeah, that's what
Boy Sweat thinks,

10:28.062 --> 10:29.541
but he's also a cock.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.630
Who's a cock?

10:30.804 --> 10:32.370
You're a cock, Dave.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.764
I reckon our man here
could pull yours right off.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.287
He looks like
he could handle a cock.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.072
Yeah, small hands.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.509
Makes me very popular,
and you look good.

10:41.597 --> 10:42.642
What's that?

10:45.470 --> 10:47.124
I said, uh...

10:48.125 --> 10:49.387
I'm sure you'd win.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.563
At what?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.653
The pull-ups.

10:56.177 --> 10:58.179
Oh, charming.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.354
One of yours?

10:59.528 --> 11:00.790
I've been lookin' for him.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.139
I'll put him back
in the collection.

11:02.313 --> 11:03.837
H: Glad I could help.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.229
BULLET: You know,
you're making friends already.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.231
It's worth
getting to know Dave.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.886
He's quite entertaining in
an unintentional kind of way.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.714
BOB: Yeah.
He once killed a hamster

11:11.888 --> 11:13.237
'cause he squeezed it
too tight.

11:13.411 --> 11:14.499
BULLET: And he can't write

11:14.674 --> 11:15.936
without sticking
his tongue out.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.416
This is
your temporary sidearm.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.809
Just till you get your own.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.202
I need you to love it,

11:21.376 --> 11:22.638
-respect it...
-

11:22.812 --> 11:24.074
...and bring it back
in one piece.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.076
Do they want us back
in one piece, too?

11:26.642 --> 11:27.687
Do you have a problem?

11:27.861 --> 11:29.950
I don't know. Do I?

11:30.124 --> 11:31.429
What happens
if we're pullin' pistols

11:31.603 --> 11:33.170
in a machine gun fight?

11:33.344 --> 11:36.043
Then you retort with
a positive mental attitude.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.698
-Name?
-He's H.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.525
H?

11:41.526 --> 11:44.704
Like the bomb,
or like Jesus H.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.751
Well, if you can mushroom
cloud or walk on water,

11:48.925 --> 11:50.840
what you worried
about machine guns for?

11:54.670 --> 11:56.280
BULLET: It's the rock star's
first day.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.718
All right, lucky you got
a soft drop, then.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.197
Try to keep
your piece strapped,

12:00.371 --> 12:01.851
like he shoulda done
on prom night.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.592
You're just unhappy I'm happy.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.072
Yeah, only man I know

12:05.246 --> 12:06.813
that married
the first woman he banged.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.510
You're a cynical old dog,
Supe.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.817
SUPER: But I still got
plenty of bitches.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.079
'Course he does.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.742
Well, that's nice.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.134
Who's your pal?

12:24.308 --> 12:25.614
I'll explain later.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.533
DANA: Jesus Christ, at least
try to look busy, Shirley.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.187
SHIRLEY: What, you got another
hot date tonight, Dana?

12:33.361 --> 12:35.624
You're gonna love
who your new partner is.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.147
Just tell me
it ain't the Limey.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.932
STUART:
The grand ol' duke himself.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.107
Fuck!

12:41.630 --> 12:43.153
Boy Sweat,
you'll be happy to hear

12:43.327 --> 12:45.068
that H
is replacing Sticky John.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.983
-Thank you, Stuart.
-You got it, Bullet.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.899
Stay out from under my feet,
and we'll get along just fine.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.728
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this job can be?

12:52.902 --> 12:53.947
Some idea, yeah.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.253
No, you have no idea.

12:56.427 --> 12:59.648
We ain't the predators,
we're the prey.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.305
Ooh.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.829
Boy Sweat's up front.
You jump in there with him.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.091
Whatever you say, boss.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.059
DAVE: Did you hear about
the guards that were murdered?

13:19.233 --> 13:20.408
You know,
it happened right down there.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.105
Come on, Dave,
it's his first day.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.803
What? He needs to hear this.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.327
Don't engage. He'll forget
what he said in a moment.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.546
I heard.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.071
It's a tragedy.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.725
Yeah, what you didn't hear

13:33.900 --> 13:35.815
is that I was meant to be
driving the truck that day.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.210
Why wasn't ya?

13:40.384 --> 13:41.429
I was sick.

13:41.603 --> 13:42.604
BULLET: Hungover.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.607
Sick. All holes.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.609
And the last thing I needed
was the Feds in my face

13:47.783 --> 13:49.741
trying to make out
if I was involved somehow.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.656
Lucky you had a strong alibi.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.963
Fuck you, Bullet.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.530
He was staying at his mom's.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.446
She knows how I like my eggs.

14:03.190 --> 14:06.410
BULLET: This is a $2 million
pickup for Bank of the US.

14:06.584 --> 14:09.370
Dave will stay in the truck.
H, you're coming with me.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.981
You get to meet the lovely
ladies who work the tills.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.983
Just be wary of Hot Betty.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.594
If you're lucky, she'll only
take your fuckin' arm off.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.991
Godfrey, H.
H, Godfrey.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.037
-H.
-Godfrey.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.647
X marks the spot.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.869
Godfrey, as always,
a pleasure.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.394
I like the way
you handle that cart.

14:33.568 --> 14:34.961
Where'd you learn
that technique?

14:35.135 --> 14:37.789
H: Spent a lot of time
in supermarkets.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.966
-Shopping.
-

14:40.140 --> 14:41.881
BULLET: I can picture it now.

14:42.055 --> 14:45.710
A paragon of modern man
on a wild sojourn,

14:45.885 --> 14:50.280
stalking down the aisles,
hunting for Pop-Tarts.

14:50.454 --> 14:53.240
Pop-Tarts are not really
my poison, Bullet.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.851
I prefer to lose myself
in the dizzy food coma

14:56.025 --> 14:59.333
of synthetic cheese
and impossible meats.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.075
BULLET: What has the world
come to?

15:02.249 --> 15:04.468
A direct line of evolution,

15:04.642 --> 15:06.340
from Paleolithic man

15:07.210 --> 15:09.473
to a diabetic house husband.

15:11.040 --> 15:11.954
Harsh.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.347
But true.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.353
How'd your boy do?

15:19.527 --> 15:21.181
Did he survive
the hostile territory

15:21.355 --> 15:23.139
of Hot Betty
and the menopausal MILFs?

15:23.879 --> 15:26.012
Did you make poo-poo,
or is your diaper still clean?

15:26.186 --> 15:27.535
He did just fine.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.103
Hot Betty
almost slid off her seat.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.932
Oh, so there's juice
in the old raisin yet.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.122
Wakey-wakey, Sticky.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.996
2411, clear to proceed.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.962
Pull her in slowly this time,
Boy Sweat.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.274
DAVE: Base,
this is Gamma reporting back.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.407
Copy that, Gamma.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.148
Where's that boyfriend
of yours?

16:15.844 --> 16:18.368
They always gotta see
the driver and messenger.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.240
Otherwise,
you ain't gettin' in.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.811
JOHN: Okay, Gamma,
you're clear.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.032
At least your boy
didn't fuck that up.

16:30.685 --> 16:31.773
I still prefer Sticky John.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.818
Everyone prefers Sticky John.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.082
Mm, you're gonna
love him, Dave.

16:36.256 --> 16:39.172
He's got that exotic European
thing workin' for him.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.869
It'll take you a while
to dial in.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.871
Hasn't taken me very long.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.786
I don't care
what you guys think.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.049
That man's a dark horse.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.442
What do you mean by that?

16:48.616 --> 16:50.313
That cat's overqualified
for this game.

16:50.487 --> 16:51.967
He's got history.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.144
We're all overqualified
for this game,

16:55.318 --> 16:56.667
and we all got history.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.019
Beer and pool?

17:00.976 --> 17:02.673
Your first day's over.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.458
It's a tradition.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.113
Sure. Give me two minutes.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.730
JOHN: Well, look who it is,
Beauty and the fucking Beast.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.993
BULLET: Ain't you gonna
put your card back, Sticky?

17:40.189 --> 17:41.973
The point of the game is
to get the ball in the hole.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.237
Point of a woman
is to shut the fuck up, Dana.

17:44.411 --> 17:45.673
All that Ivy League education

17:45.847 --> 17:47.544
is really workin' for you,
Boy Sweat.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.198
Pretty soon
you'll all be workin' for me.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.895
The power's
in this big head here.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.897
Well, it's definitely not
in your little head,

17:53.072 --> 17:54.421
or are you
still blaming the beer?

17:55.944 --> 17:58.512
Yo, Jap's eye, you gonna
take a shot, or what?

17:58.686 --> 18:00.949
At least I'll still be here
next week to take a shot.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.994
What's that supposed
to fuckin' mean?

18:03.169 --> 18:04.909
He's already got your old job.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.391
Word around the pool table is
boss has eyes for the new boy.

18:08.565 --> 18:11.438
What, flat-footed Limey?
I'd shit him.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.135
Maybe you should
say that to his face.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.615
Maybe I will.

18:14.789 --> 18:17.879
I spy with my little eye
that I smell fear.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.620
That doesn't make any sense.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.187
Hey, John.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.580
You're an idiot.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.975
JOHN: Fuckin' assholes.

18:27.149 --> 18:28.890
Here comes the walk of shame.

18:29.456 --> 18:30.718
JOHN: Yo, Action Man,

18:30.892 --> 18:32.937
can I buy you a beer?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.287
Nah.

18:37.812 --> 18:38.943
Sorry, uh...

18:39.944 --> 18:41.555
You mind?

18:48.910 --> 18:50.738
So, uh, where'd
you work before, then?

18:51.434 --> 18:55.743
Orange Delta Security, Europe.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.267
Jolly excitin', was it, mate?

19:02.532 --> 19:04.621
Yeah, spectacular.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.496
You ain't much for talking,
are ya, Mary Poppins?

19:09.670 --> 19:11.193
Oh, no, I can talk.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.456
I just don't want
to talk to you.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.197
Let me buy you a beer.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.852
Just make sure
you drink it over there.

19:29.907 --> 19:30.908
Anything else?

19:39.439 --> 19:41.484
BULLET:
I gotta give it to ya, H.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.791
You're a real social magician.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.881
First, you take his job,

19:47.708 --> 19:50.276
and then you make him cry
in his beer.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.690
DAVE: What is
taking him so long?

20:14.125 --> 20:15.431
It's a 10-grand drop.

20:15.605 --> 20:16.824
He should have been back
five minutes ago.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.656
Hey, Bullet,
what's taking you so long?

20:27.574 --> 20:29.140
Bullet, unless you found

20:29.315 --> 20:30.925
some beautiful,
blue-eyed Latino boy,

20:31.099 --> 20:32.448
you should be back by now.

20:38.411 --> 20:39.455
BULLET: Fuck, fuck!

20:41.631 --> 20:42.980
ROBBER:
You fucking look at me...

20:43.154 --> 20:44.678
You see me,
and you fucking die!

20:51.511 --> 20:52.990
Dave...

20:53.208 --> 20:54.818
ROBBER 2: We're gonna
fucking kill him.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.607
Now, listen to me, ladies.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.783
If you wanna see
your girlfriend again,

21:02.957 --> 21:04.741
you'll do exactly as I say.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.136
DAVE: Uh...

21:10.617 --> 21:12.706
I have to call this...
No! Uh...

21:12.880 --> 21:14.273
There's a protocol for this.
We have to drive away.

21:14.447 --> 21:16.405
-We just drive away.
-Sorry?

21:16.884 --> 21:18.929
They don't want his 10 grand.
They don't want his 10 grand.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.931
The money's in the truck.
We have $2.5 million in here.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.455
If we take it away,
they're not gonna hurt him.

21:22.629 --> 21:23.586
They're not gonna kill him
for 10 grand.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.153
Dave,

21:25.849 --> 21:27.286
you need to
pull yourself together.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.113
You need to reconsider this.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.637
Reconsider?

21:30.811 --> 21:32.116
That's why they have
the fucking policy!

21:32.291 --> 21:33.422
You don't wanna do this,

21:33.596 --> 21:34.815
you can get out
of the truck now.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.034
But we're not
leaving him behind.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.340
He's one of us.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.211
It's only money.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.170
In short,

21:42.823 --> 21:44.477
I'm getting him back.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.741
Stop fucking around.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.831
You have one minute
before she dies.

21:51.614 --> 21:54.661
Now, turn the key and drive,

21:54.835 --> 21:57.968
and I will tell you
when to stop.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.449
You gonna drive,
or you getting out?

22:00.928 --> 22:02.625
Oh, shit.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.324
This is such a bad idea.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.817
Take the next left.

22:37.834 --> 22:40.271
Now, stop the truck.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.805
-BULLET: All right. All right.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.068
ROBBER: Get the fuck
over here.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.896
ROBBER 3: We got
your fucking friend.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.550
He don't mean shit to us.

22:57.854 --> 22:58.812
They're serious!

22:58.986 --> 23:00.074
-

23:00.248 --> 23:01.554
ROBBER: Shut the fuck up.

23:01.728 --> 23:04.339
ROBBER 3:
Open the fucking doors,

23:04.513 --> 23:07.647
and pick up the money,
and throw it in the flatbed.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.257
You open it, they're just
gonna kill all three of us

23:09.431 --> 23:11.172
and take the money anyway.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.217
Dave, you just worry about

23:13.392 --> 23:14.915
putting your arsehole
back in your arsehole,

23:15.089 --> 23:16.960
and leave this to me.

23:17.613 --> 23:18.614
Fuck!

23:36.502 --> 23:38.068
Fuck!

23:38.242 --> 23:39.722
ROBBER 1: This guy's fucking
around. He's throwing

23:39.896 --> 23:40.767
-bags on the floor.
-God fucking damn it.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.246
Now, listen up, fuckboy.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.032
I said throw the money
in the fucking flatbed.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.686
Try to get clever again,

23:46.860 --> 23:49.166
and old boy's getting
a face full of shit.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.341
Now, aim fucking straight!

23:50.516 --> 23:51.647
Just do what he says.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.562
These guys
are fucking serious.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.569
ROBBER 1: Get it in the truck
next time, you fucknut!

24:00.961 --> 24:02.310
Sorry, pal.

24:04.181 --> 24:05.182
Oh, fuck!

24:09.056 --> 24:10.274
Fuck!

24:10.449 --> 24:11.362
DAVE: Please!
Put the gun down!

24:11.537 --> 24:12.755
Just let them take the money!

24:12.929 --> 24:13.756
You're gonna
get us fucking killed.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.542
ROBBER 1: Fuck, go, move!

24:17.064 --> 24:18.239
DAVE: Please stop!

24:18.413 --> 24:19.849
Just give 'em
the fucking money!

24:20.023 --> 24:21.634
Are you fucking insane?

24:24.506 --> 24:26.116
DAVE: Fuck! Fuck!

24:40.609 --> 24:42.350
Bullet! Bullet!

24:42.524 --> 24:44.178
Who is this fucking lunatic?

24:45.571 --> 24:47.529
-

24:57.060 --> 24:58.453
-

25:05.939 --> 25:07.810
-Ahh! Fuck!

25:10.596 --> 25:11.640
Jesus Christ.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.642
Who do you work for?

25:14.208 --> 25:16.384
Suck my fucking dick!

25:17.037 --> 25:18.081
What did you say?

25:19.256 --> 25:21.781
I said suck my fucking dick!

25:21.955 --> 25:23.217
Suck your own dick.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.795
You all right, Dave?

25:37.884 --> 25:39.538
Did you make poo-poo?

25:57.294 --> 25:58.513
Thank you for that.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.390
Last but not least, Mr. Hill.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.567
OKEY: Well, you're all
sticking to the same story.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.569
That's what happened.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.745
What I don't understand

26:12.919 --> 26:14.181
is how you managed
to take down six men

26:14.355 --> 26:15.835
without even so much
as a scratch.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.619
Well, you gotta admit
it's impressive.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.403
He saved his partner's life.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.145
What about
your firearms experience?

26:22.319 --> 26:25.584
Your shooting was
unambiguously precise, yet

26:26.585 --> 26:29.152
your training scores
were decidedly average.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.285
Barely even passed.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.767
Kill or be killed.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.422
Seemed to focus the mind.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.646
Well, there's something else.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.258
We'd like you
to take a look at this video.

26:48.432 --> 26:49.825
It's the security footage

26:49.999 --> 26:52.132
from the raid on
the Fortico cash truck before.

26:52.306 --> 26:53.829
When the guards were killed.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.396
Uh, I can't watch this again.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.354
OKEY: Step outside,
by all means.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.793
We just want
you to let us know

27:00.967 --> 27:02.316
if you think
there's any connection

27:02.490 --> 27:03.752
between this robbery

27:03.926 --> 27:05.624
and the men
you encountered before.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.593
You, uh... You all right
to keep watching?

27:19.638 --> 27:22.597
Yeah. I'm all right.

27:27.776 --> 27:28.864
Mr. Hill?

27:29.473 --> 27:30.779
Anything ringing a bell?

27:35.305 --> 27:36.437
Mr. Hill?

27:37.873 --> 27:40.136
Could they be related
in any way?

27:43.052 --> 27:44.227
-Any connection, Mr. Hill?

27:44.401 --> 27:45.794
No.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.144
OKEY: You sure?

27:50.277 --> 27:51.278
I'm sure.

27:54.281 --> 27:55.412
OKEY: All right, Mr. Hill,

27:55.586 --> 27:57.110
we'll pick this up
another day.

28:00.461 --> 28:01.462
Are we done?

28:01.636 --> 28:02.985
Yeah, we'll be in touch.

28:03.725 --> 28:06.685
Visit the therapist. Rest up.

28:08.338 --> 28:09.862
Thank you, Mr. Hill.

28:15.389 --> 28:17.043
Patrick, can I have a word?

28:18.087 --> 28:19.698
We have a policy.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.525
The shrinks advise

28:21.700 --> 28:23.876
that employees be taken off
the front line for a month

28:24.050 --> 28:25.660
following violent incidents,

28:25.834 --> 28:28.271
and longer if lives were lost.

28:28.445 --> 28:31.100
So, we're gonna
transfer you to desk duty,

28:31.274 --> 28:32.667
in case of PTSD.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.060
Do I look disturbed?

28:34.234 --> 28:35.670
No. No, you don't.

28:35.844 --> 28:38.281
But then, these things
take time to manifest,

28:38.455 --> 28:39.848
to percolate.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.937
It's with your best interests
at heart.

28:42.111 --> 28:44.766
You hired me to do a job.
Did a job.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.464
No, we hired you
to move money.

28:47.638 --> 28:48.770
You hired me to protect money.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.467
MAN: Mr. Hill.

28:51.599 --> 28:54.558
Hey, I'm Blake Halls.
I own Fortico.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.343
I wanted to congratulate you
for yesterday

28:56.517 --> 28:58.040
and to thank you in person.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.260
What you did deserves credit.

29:00.434 --> 29:02.131
You're a real hero,

29:02.305 --> 29:04.743
and that's not wasted on me.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.440
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off

29:06.614 --> 29:09.486
while Terry and I
discuss your promising future?

29:12.620 --> 29:15.797
Terry, we need that guy
in the field.

29:15.971 --> 29:18.495
If we'd had him last year,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.280
He's exactly what we need,

29:20.454 --> 29:23.413
and the publicity for Fortico
has been very positive.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.067
Plus, have you heard
the crews talking?

29:25.241 --> 29:26.547
They're inspired.

29:26.721 --> 29:29.028
So, don't punish him,
promote him.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.033
AGENT: Well?

29:34.207 --> 29:35.469
Yes, it was him.

29:36.165 --> 29:38.472
Oh, it had him
written all over it.

29:38.646 --> 29:40.648
Question is,
what was he doing there?

29:41.170 --> 29:43.346
I think we know
what he was doing there, boss.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.696
Oh, clever fucking you,
Hubbard.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.176
It's called sarcasm.

29:47.350 --> 29:48.743
HUBBARD:
What do you want us to do?

29:48.917 --> 29:50.658
Not a fucking thing.
Let the painter paint.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.399
HUBBARD: Do you have any idea
what would happen to us

29:52.573 --> 29:53.922
if anyone found out

29:54.096 --> 29:56.229
that we let the fox
in the fucking henhouse?

29:57.099 --> 29:59.710
The Bureau's been trying to
catch this man for 25 years.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.322
We're just gonna let him
sit on hundreds of millions?

30:02.496 --> 30:04.063
Money doesn't mean
a thing to him.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.934
Listen, there's a reason
why I chose you two.

30:06.108 --> 30:08.110
Because we have
the same priorities.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.113
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

30:12.245 --> 30:13.681
As far as you're concerned,

30:13.855 --> 30:14.725
he's just a regular guard
doing a good job.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.031
Do we understand each other?

30:18.164 --> 30:19.730
-Loud and clear.
-

30:22.255 --> 30:23.647
"Let the painter paint"?

30:25.258 --> 30:26.781
What the fuck
does that look like?

30:42.666 --> 30:44.451
Fortico personnel files,

30:44.930 --> 30:47.106
pictures of Dana's family,

30:50.457 --> 30:52.589
the autopsy report.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.225
You hear me?

31:19.399 --> 31:20.748
Out of the fucking car!

31:20.922 --> 31:22.881
Face down, motherfucker!
Come on!

31:23.055 --> 31:24.621
Show me your fucking hands!

31:24.795 --> 31:26.058
Face down
on the ground right now!

31:29.322 --> 31:30.801
-MAN 2: What the fuck?

31:30.976 --> 31:32.586
MAN 1: Face to
the fucking ground!

31:42.161 --> 31:44.772
Seems you can walk on water,
after all.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.690
Keep up the good work,
soldier.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.083
MAN: Nice one, man.

31:53.781 --> 31:55.043
GUARD: Be my guest.

31:57.741 --> 31:58.612
All right, brother.

32:00.353 --> 32:01.920
-MAN: Yeah, man! Let's go!
-

32:04.879 --> 32:06.359
Jump on up, big boy.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.155
H: We should get takeout.
From the Blossom.

32:21.722 --> 32:24.594
The noodle soup at Neptune's
is the bomb.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.814
I prefer the Blossom.

32:27.119 --> 32:28.468
All right.

32:28.903 --> 32:30.905
You gonna call the order in?

32:31.819 --> 32:33.168
I'm busy.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.040
I can see that.

32:35.562 --> 32:36.911
-Who's this joker?
-

32:37.564 --> 32:38.826
What the hell's going on?

32:39.000 --> 32:39.958
ROBBER 1: Move it!
Get the fuck back!

32:40.132 --> 32:41.220
ROBBER 2: Get down!

32:43.439 --> 32:44.440
H: Reverse! Reverse!

32:44.614 --> 32:45.659
BULLET: I can't fucking see!

32:51.143 --> 32:53.275
Gamma to Base,
we have a Code Red.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.148
JOHN: Gamma, this is Base.
What's your location? Over.

32:56.322 --> 32:57.584
ROBBER 3: Port's covered!

32:57.758 --> 32:59.107
BULLET: Chinatown!
Broadway and Hill.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.805
Repeat, Code Red in progress.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.503
JOHN: All right, Gamma,
just follow procedure.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.287
-Stay in the truck. Over.
-

33:05.461 --> 33:06.810
ROBBER 3: Get out
of the fucking truck!

33:06.985 --> 33:08.203
JOHN: Police have been
dispatched.

33:08.377 --> 33:09.726
ROBBER 3: Come on,
get out of there!

33:09.900 --> 33:11.424
ROBBER 1: Get out
of the fucking truck!

33:11.598 --> 33:13.034
-JOHN: Gamma, come in.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.296
ROBBER 2: On the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

33:14.470 --> 33:15.776
ROBBER 3:
Open the fucking doors!

33:16.907 --> 33:17.908
JOHN: What's your status?
Over.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.171
ROBBER 3: Get down!

33:19.910 --> 33:20.824
Get down!

33:24.437 --> 33:25.873
Get down on the ground!

33:26.787 --> 33:28.571
You got three seconds!

33:34.577 --> 33:37.145
So... So...
So, let me get this straight,

33:37.319 --> 33:38.799
they just walked away?

33:38.973 --> 33:41.280
Get in
the fucking van! Move it!

33:41.454 --> 33:42.716
ROBBER 1:
Let's fucking go now!

33:42.890 --> 33:43.847
ROBBER 2: Get the fuck
out of here!

33:52.160 --> 33:54.510
Doors were open.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.860
What the fuck was it, Mike?

33:58.340 --> 33:59.341
It was the...

34:00.342 --> 34:01.343
Yeah.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.129
Turned back around and left.

34:07.436 --> 34:09.134
No, I'm sorry...

34:09.308 --> 34:11.919
But what Terry is trying to
say is that you're a legend.

34:12.093 --> 34:13.442
And if you keep this up,

34:13.616 --> 34:15.096
you won't just be
employee of the month,

34:15.270 --> 34:17.838
you'll have your own calendar
and merchandise.

34:19.231 --> 34:21.102
Now, get out there
and keep crushing it.

34:26.977 --> 34:28.631
Why are you so cynical?

34:29.023 --> 34:31.156
I'm starting to think
he's a psychopath.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.902
-I hear H is for Hero.

34:40.382 --> 34:41.731
Drink?

34:57.965 --> 34:59.619
It doesn't feel right.

35:05.407 --> 35:06.800
It was as if he recognized H.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.632
Like he saw a dark spirit.

35:15.374 --> 35:16.418
What are you saying?

35:18.942 --> 35:20.901
BULLET: I don't know
what I'm saying.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.470
He's not a cop.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.908
Doesn't smell like a cop.

35:29.257 --> 35:31.259
But if he's not a cop,
what is he?

35:33.392 --> 35:35.133
He's a dark fucking spirit.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.098
Put that on.

35:45.055 --> 35:46.361
Meet me next door.

35:49.408 --> 35:51.149
I told you that first day...

35:51.888 --> 35:53.194
I don't trust him.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.290
What the hell are you doing?

36:02.464 --> 36:04.118
Sit down.

36:04.292 --> 36:05.772
I'm not fucking sitting down.
I wanna go back to bed.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.644
Dana. Sit down.

36:32.625 --> 36:35.410
You got 10 seconds
to explain this.

36:36.716 --> 36:38.021
I'm not telling you anything.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.893
Dana.

36:40.067 --> 36:43.201
It's very important that
you take my inquiry seriously.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.985
I take it very seriously

36:45.159 --> 36:46.291
that you think
you can interrogate me

36:46.465 --> 36:47.988
in my own fucking house.

36:52.384 --> 36:53.907
Fuck.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.343
Jesus Christ, okay,
it's my savings, all right?

36:55.517 --> 36:56.823
The fuck has it
got to do with you?

36:56.997 --> 36:58.433
Dana, you're not listening.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.130
Fuck! Jeez, all right,
all right, all right!

37:00.305 --> 37:01.915
Please stop.

37:11.751 --> 37:13.013
Sit down.

37:17.626 --> 37:19.237
I found it.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.716
Okay? It had been
signed for one day

37:20.890 --> 37:22.457
by the staff at Grande Liquor,

37:22.631 --> 37:24.024
and they missed it.
It was in the trolley, so...

37:24.198 --> 37:25.112
You stole it?

37:25.286 --> 37:27.332
Yeah, I fucking stole it.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.769
It's 125,000. It's...

37:30.248 --> 37:32.250
It's my retirement fund.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.817
You working
with anyone on the inside?

37:36.558 --> 37:37.820
I don't know what the fuck...

37:39.344 --> 37:42.129
Think carefully before
you answer the question.

37:47.787 --> 37:48.788
No.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.405
The retirement fund is yours.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.930
But if it comes to light
that you're not telling me

38:01.104 --> 38:03.193
something
that I need to know,

38:04.847 --> 38:07.154
I want you to understand

38:07.328 --> 38:09.504
how resourceful
and serious I am.

38:10.723 --> 38:13.073
On the table
is a picture of your parents.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.118
Had it taken last week.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.121
I got your contacts...

38:19.427 --> 38:20.515
I know who you love...

38:22.387 --> 38:24.954
and I do bear a grudge.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.392
We understand each other?

38:29.872 --> 38:31.265
Good.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.014
BOY: They're saying
that climate change

38:41.188 --> 38:42.537
is a natural phenomenon,

38:42.711 --> 38:44.017
rather than
an artificial phenomenon.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.975
So how do you explain
global warming?

38:46.149 --> 38:47.629
The ice caps melting?

38:47.803 --> 38:50.502
Well, what melts up there
reforms down there.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.634
Do you know why they call
the Arctic the Arctic

38:52.808 --> 38:54.506
and the Antarctic
the Antarctic?

38:54.680 --> 38:56.246
No, Dougie, I don't.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.423
That's why I pay for you
to go to good schools.

38:58.597 --> 38:59.946
"Arktos"means
"bear" in Greek.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.164
"Ant"means "without."

39:01.339 --> 39:04.211
Hence, ant arktos,

39:04.690 --> 39:06.387
"without bears."

39:06.692 --> 39:08.737
Up with, down without.

39:09.695 --> 39:12.654
Good news for ice cubes,
bad news for polar bears.

39:12.828 --> 39:13.829
What time does the game start?

39:14.003 --> 39:16.136
6:30. We've got ages.

39:16.310 --> 39:17.833
What do you wanna do?

39:18.007 --> 39:19.313
I don't know, grab some food?

39:20.967 --> 39:22.011
Sure.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.840
Hello? What is it, Mike?

39:25.014 --> 39:26.668
MIKE: We've got a problem
with the job.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.975
We're gonna need you
to put eyes on the truck.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.023
Dougie, go get a coat,
will ya?

39:34.807 --> 39:36.112
It's not gonna rain.

39:36.591 --> 39:38.332
Dougie, coat.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.073
But why?

39:40.247 --> 39:43.032
'Cause I'm your dad,
and I said so.

39:46.209 --> 39:47.646
Get someone else to do it.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.561
I can't, boss.
There is no one else.

39:49.735 --> 39:50.649
It's gotta be you.

39:50.823 --> 39:52.607
Joe, two fuckin' minutes!

39:52.781 --> 39:54.130
H: I'm with my son, Mike.

39:54.304 --> 39:55.915
You know Dougie's
over here on holiday,

39:56.089 --> 39:57.656
and it's the only time
I get to see him.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.832
It's your fuckin' job.
You do it.

40:00.572 --> 40:01.964
MIKE: Understood.

40:03.575 --> 40:05.446
Brendan was on it, but he got
knocked off his bike

40:05.620 --> 40:06.926
by a drunk driver.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.668
Make sure the boss knows
it's not my fault.

40:09.842 --> 40:11.539
It's a drunk driver.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.149
Now, he's with the police
right now, making a statement.

40:13.323 --> 40:14.542
Otherwise,
he'd find a way to be there.

40:14.716 --> 40:15.804
There is no one else.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.197
I'm out of town,

40:17.371 --> 40:19.504
Moggy's surveying the depot.

40:19.982 --> 40:21.723
I'd help if I could, Mike.

40:21.897 --> 40:23.595
But my eyeballs
are on the depot.

40:23.769 --> 40:25.118
Then postpone it.

40:25.292 --> 40:26.989
MIKE: Oh, we can do that
if you want,

40:27.163 --> 40:28.948
but it's gonna set us back
three months of recon.

40:29.122 --> 40:31.603
We need to know the route.
If they turn left or right.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.126
That's all
you have to witness.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.823
Yeah, and there's no danger
to it at all.

40:34.997 --> 40:37.217
You can stand back
a thousand yards.

40:37.391 --> 40:39.262
Didn't you put trackers
on the truck?

40:39.872 --> 40:41.264
MIKE: They scan the trucks

40:41.439 --> 40:42.352
every time
they return to the base.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.180
We can't do it digitally.

40:44.354 --> 40:46.095
We gotta put eyes on it. And,

40:46.269 --> 40:48.054
-boss?
-

40:48.837 --> 40:50.491
Tracking you on your phone
right now.

40:50.665 --> 40:52.362
You're blocks away.
Ten minutes.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.148
And I repeat, no danger.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.064
DOUGIE: Dad?

40:59.021 --> 41:01.023
-Happy?
-Happy.

41:11.730 --> 41:14.167
I'm starving. Fancy a burrito?

41:14.341 --> 41:16.299
You don't even like burritos.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.997
I know, but I'm starving.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.042
Sure.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.006
I'll be two minutes, okay?

41:28.050 --> 41:30.183
Keep the doors locked.
Don't go anywhere.

41:30.357 --> 41:31.401
All right.

41:43.326 --> 41:44.284
CHEF: Yes, sir?

41:44.458 --> 41:45.503
Two burritos, please, sir.

41:45.677 --> 41:46.721
CHEF: You got it.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.114
Go ahead, Mike.

41:48.288 --> 41:50.072
MIKE: I can see you there.

41:50.246 --> 41:54.381
Now, is there some gates
on your left-hand side?

41:56.426 --> 41:57.427
H: Yeah.

41:57.602 --> 41:58.951
MIKE: Now, in a minute,

41:59.125 --> 42:01.083
those said gates
are gonna open,

42:01.867 --> 42:04.260
and that said minute is now.

42:09.657 --> 42:11.441
All I need to know from you

42:11.616 --> 42:14.314
is if that truck
is turning left or right.

42:19.754 --> 42:20.973
Latter.

42:25.194 --> 42:27.022
CHARLIE: You know,
make your own cappuccino.

42:27.457 --> 42:29.285
MICK: Ugh, God damn!

42:29.459 --> 42:30.765
CHARLIE: What is this?

42:49.305 --> 42:51.786
MAN 1: Yo, out of
the fuckin' car! Come on!

42:51.960 --> 42:54.267
Don't fuckin' look at me!
Out of the fuckin' car!

42:54.441 --> 42:57.052
-

42:57.226 --> 42:58.532
All right, Mike.

42:58.706 --> 43:00.360
That's my day done.

43:00.534 --> 43:01.927
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your call
has been forwarded to...

43:02.101 --> 43:03.842
MAN 1: You hear me?
Out of the fuckin' car!

43:04.016 --> 43:05.539
Face down, motherfucker!
Come on!

43:05.931 --> 43:07.367
Show me your fuckin' hands!

43:07.541 --> 43:09.848
Face down on the ground
right now!

43:10.022 --> 43:11.458
There you go.

43:11.632 --> 43:12.807
MAN 2: Do what we say,
and you fucking live.

43:12.981 --> 43:14.809
MAN 1: Face to
the fucking ground!

43:15.810 --> 43:17.464
-Thank you.
-CHEF: Have a good one.

43:21.947 --> 43:23.209
MAN 3: Two minutes!

43:23.557 --> 43:25.037
-

43:30.303 --> 43:31.391
MAN 3: Fuck!

43:32.740 --> 43:34.307
MAN 4: Number one,
are we good?

43:34.481 --> 43:36.309
-Are we good, number one?
-MAN 3: We're good.

43:36.570 --> 43:38.050
Dougie?

45:14.233 --> 45:17.105
Try not to, uh,
move too quickly.

45:17.279 --> 45:18.933
You're in a hospital.

45:19.325 --> 45:21.893
You were in an accident,
you were shot at.

45:22.894 --> 45:24.591
Six bullets removed,

45:24.765 --> 45:26.985
and three operations.

45:27.463 --> 45:29.422
Two life-saving.

45:29.596 --> 45:31.511
You lost
a fifth of your blood.

45:32.120 --> 45:35.733
You've... You've got
a warrior's spirit, Mr. Mace.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.084
What about my son?

45:42.391 --> 45:43.523
Dougie.

45:57.842 --> 45:59.582
WOMAN: My beautiful boy.

46:05.458 --> 46:07.155
And now, he's gone.

46:12.073 --> 46:13.771
He looked up to you.

46:20.081 --> 46:22.257
He was obsessed with you.

46:27.697 --> 46:29.525
It wasn't my work, Jane.

46:34.879 --> 46:37.142
You killed our son.

46:50.111 --> 46:52.722
And still,
you have nothing to say.

47:01.122 --> 47:05.474
You are a cold, cold cunt.

47:41.162 --> 47:43.295
AGENT: My condolences
for your loss.

47:47.821 --> 47:50.780
Before you ask, we have
no leads on this thing.

47:51.999 --> 47:54.567
Which is kinda strange
for a job this big.

47:57.526 --> 47:59.137
Somebody knows something.

47:59.311 --> 48:00.834
Somebody always
knows something.

48:01.008 --> 48:03.576
It's just I'm not allowed
to ask the hard questions.

48:10.800 --> 48:12.715
Here's the shit list.

48:13.194 --> 48:15.066
Knock yourself out.

48:23.552 --> 48:25.032
Need any of them to live?

48:25.815 --> 48:29.080
I don't miss anyone that
your boys have buried so far.

48:31.996 --> 48:34.346
Then you're gonna
let me do this my way.

48:38.306 --> 48:40.569
I can do in two weeks

48:40.743 --> 48:43.224
what you only wish
you could do in 20 years.

48:45.487 --> 48:46.575
If their names
are on that list,

48:46.749 --> 48:48.186
you can do your worst.

48:50.318 --> 48:51.711
Just be mindful

48:51.885 --> 48:53.931
that I can only look confused
for so long.

48:55.454 --> 48:56.716
The floor is yours.

49:13.733 --> 49:15.082
MOGGY: Brendan.

49:16.866 --> 49:18.477
You need to quit that.

49:18.651 --> 49:20.609
I can hardly breathe here.

49:21.567 --> 49:23.221
MOGGY: It wasn't your fault.

49:24.135 --> 49:25.658
It was a drunk driver.

49:27.181 --> 49:29.183
That's easy for you to say.

49:29.357 --> 49:31.577
It's his son, Moggy.
His only son.

49:31.751 --> 49:33.796
Hey, we all fucked up.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.755
So, let's accept
responsibility

49:35.929 --> 49:37.757
and not turn on each other
in there.

49:38.366 --> 49:41.630
Brendan, retain your dignity.

49:49.508 --> 49:51.640
MIKE: It's a fuckin' tragedy,
boss.

49:51.814 --> 49:55.253
MOGGY: We all loved Dougie
and our sympathies run deep.

49:55.427 --> 49:56.994
BRENDAN: It's more my fault
than anyone's,

49:57.168 --> 49:59.648
and we'll do anything
to find who's responsible.

50:03.217 --> 50:05.263
I need to know
who pulled the trigger.

50:08.527 --> 50:10.050
I need a face.

50:10.224 --> 50:11.356
MOGGY: Of course.

50:12.444 --> 50:13.749
And we've been
on nothing else,

50:13.923 --> 50:15.142
trying to get answers.

50:15.708 --> 50:17.753
It's not any
of the usual suspects.

50:21.235 --> 50:23.672
You're gonna tell us
what we wanna know.

50:25.587 --> 50:27.937
This is your last chance.

50:29.156 --> 50:30.853
The tree has been shook.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.421
And it's been shook hard.

50:36.946 --> 50:38.687
I want a name.

50:39.732 --> 50:42.909
Anyone with the skillset
or the form.

50:43.779 --> 50:45.520
We've run out of names.

50:45.694 --> 50:49.089
We've deployed large amounts
of time, money, and effort...

50:49.263 --> 50:51.961
-...in the search for justice.

50:53.746 --> 50:55.269
It was a long list.

50:55.965 --> 50:57.184
Not good enough.

50:57.358 --> 50:59.099
MOGGY: Understood,

50:59.578 --> 51:01.493
but we've scorched the earth.

51:02.755 --> 51:04.409
H: No, it's not understood.

51:06.715 --> 51:08.978
You started by saying
you'd do anything,

51:09.153 --> 51:11.242
but what I'm hearing is

51:11.416 --> 51:13.548
you think
you've done everything.

51:22.644 --> 51:24.037
Understood.

51:24.429 --> 51:26.692
I hear the train a-comin'

51:28.607 --> 51:31.000
It's rollin' 'round the bend

51:33.046 --> 51:35.570
And I ain't seen the sunshine

51:37.268 --> 51:39.966
Since I don't know when

51:41.794 --> 51:44.318
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison

51:44.492 --> 51:47.452
And time keeps draggin' on

51:50.368 --> 51:52.935
But that train keeps a-rollin'

51:55.242 --> 51:58.332
On down to San Antone

51:59.638 --> 52:02.815
On down to San Antone

52:05.905 --> 52:08.342
When I was just a baby

52:10.127 --> 52:11.911
My mama told me, "Son..."

52:12.085 --> 52:13.347
The fuck?

52:13.521 --> 52:14.783
MOGGY: Make a sound
and you're dead.

52:15.262 --> 52:16.437
-"Always be a good boy"
-What the fuck?

52:16.611 --> 52:18.222
-

52:18.396 --> 52:19.397
Get off me!

52:19.571 --> 52:21.747
"Don't ever play with guns"

52:24.053 --> 52:26.360
All right, Jerome,
what do you think?

52:26.534 --> 52:28.449
It's getting late.
We all got places to go.

52:28.623 --> 52:29.842
So, why don't you
save us a lot of time

52:30.016 --> 52:31.235
and you a lot of trouble

52:31.409 --> 52:32.453
and tell us
what we need to know?

52:32.801 --> 52:34.499
Trouble?

52:34.673 --> 52:37.154
You motherfuckers got no idea
how much trouble you in.

52:37.328 --> 52:38.677
Do you know who the fuck I am?

52:38.851 --> 52:40.244
Yeah, I know
exactly who you are,

52:40.418 --> 52:41.810
and that's why you're here.

52:41.984 --> 52:43.160
So, I can see
it's gonna be a long night.

52:43.334 --> 52:44.335
Let's get started.

52:44.683 --> 52:45.727
Bag him.

52:46.554 --> 52:47.903
You motherfuckers!

52:48.077 --> 52:49.470
I hear the train a-comin'

52:49.644 --> 52:50.689
Get the fuck off me!

52:52.865 --> 52:54.693
-It's rollin' 'round the bend
-

52:56.956 --> 52:59.567
And I ain't seen the sunshine

53:01.047 --> 53:03.919
Since I don't know when

53:06.095 --> 53:08.054
When I was just a baby

53:10.143 --> 53:12.624
My mama told me, "Son...

53:14.887 --> 53:17.106
"Always be a good boy

53:18.717 --> 53:21.328
"Don't ever play with guns"

53:26.899 --> 53:28.901
-All right, take it off.

53:44.003 --> 53:46.092
I don't think
he knows anything.

53:51.271 --> 53:52.794
We'll see about that.

53:59.932 --> 54:02.500
I hear you're a tough lad
and a hard worker.

54:03.631 --> 54:05.111
Good for you.

54:06.939 --> 54:08.375
But you're still
gonna give me a name.

54:11.117 --> 54:13.250
If not for your life,
for hers.

54:16.296 --> 54:17.558
JEROME: What the fuck?

54:17.732 --> 54:19.517
Don't touch her!
I said don't touch her!

54:20.126 --> 54:21.345
Don't fucking touch her!

54:21.519 --> 54:22.998
-Leave her out of this!
-Bag her.

54:23.172 --> 54:24.043
-

54:25.349 --> 54:26.393
JEROME: All right.

54:27.002 --> 54:29.701
The only fuckin' name.

54:37.230 --> 54:38.449
The Gashi brothers.

54:52.985 --> 54:54.943
If it's anyone, it's them.

54:56.205 --> 54:57.511
Fucking dark.

54:57.685 --> 55:02.299
Porn, trafficking,
witchcraft, kids,

55:02.473 --> 55:04.388
home invasions.

55:04.562 --> 55:07.173
It's talked about
there's cash trucks, too.

55:07.565 --> 55:09.131
But you did not
hear this from me,

55:09.306 --> 55:10.437
and if you did,

55:11.525 --> 55:12.526
kill me now.

55:22.101 --> 55:23.885
Give him 200 grand.

55:24.059 --> 55:25.800
Put the keys in the car.

55:42.251 --> 55:43.949
Pass me the water.

55:46.038 --> 55:47.779
-You all right?
-

55:49.781 --> 55:51.173
No, I'm not.

55:52.523 --> 55:54.263
It's a shitshow.

55:55.569 --> 55:57.310
Fucking reptiles.

56:00.705 --> 56:02.663
There's kids involved.

56:05.710 --> 56:08.495
Got a feeling I'm gonna
be cleaning up all day.

56:21.726 --> 56:22.857
Mike!

57:16.215 --> 57:17.782
MIKE: Here you go, sweetheart.

57:17.956 --> 57:19.566
Drink some water.

57:20.262 --> 57:21.960
There's a good girl.

57:30.359 --> 57:32.187
-

57:35.930 --> 57:37.758
-

57:37.932 --> 57:38.977
-

57:53.513 --> 57:55.384
How much is in the pot?

57:56.908 --> 57:58.605
I'd say 2.5.

57:59.998 --> 58:01.739
So, what do you think?

58:03.523 --> 58:04.655
I think

58:05.873 --> 58:07.135
it isn't them.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.576
You gotta tell the boss.

58:22.237 --> 58:24.370
MOGGY: They're filthy fucks.

58:24.544 --> 58:27.373
And they have done trucks,
but they ain't our men.

58:27.547 --> 58:29.767
That job was above them.

58:29.941 --> 58:32.726
They're more
about the smash-and-grab.

58:32.900 --> 58:34.075
Looks like
there's two and a half mil,

58:34.249 --> 58:35.207
which they confessed to,

58:35.381 --> 58:36.513
but, uh,

58:37.688 --> 58:39.385
what do you want me to do?

58:43.737 --> 58:45.783
Don't want you
to do anything, Moggy.

59:02.756 --> 59:04.497
How old are these girls?

59:06.194 --> 59:07.805
Not old enough.

59:16.030 --> 59:17.466
-

59:17.728 --> 59:19.425
Give the girls the cash.

59:20.034 --> 59:21.296
Let 'em go.

59:51.675 --> 59:54.068
Can I speak candidly, boss?

59:58.638 --> 1:00:00.640
I don't think
we should do this again.

1:00:03.077 --> 1:00:04.949
Understandably, you're...

1:00:06.298 --> 1:00:08.692
You're not in your right mind
just now and

1:00:10.128 --> 1:00:11.608
you need a break.

1:00:14.393 --> 1:00:15.699
But we can't continue

1:00:15.873 --> 1:00:17.526
to handle business this way,
otherwise

1:00:18.223 --> 1:00:21.182
some fucker's gonna come for
us before we can get to them.

1:00:24.229 --> 1:00:25.230
In truth,

1:00:25.404 --> 1:00:27.014
we need a different approach.

1:00:30.278 --> 1:00:32.716
It's gotta be an inside job.

1:00:34.674 --> 1:00:36.415
You're right, Mike.

1:00:38.373 --> 1:00:40.288
I shouldn't have
got you involved.

1:00:45.250 --> 1:00:47.034
I'm gonna go back
to London for a while.

1:00:51.299 --> 1:00:52.431
WOMAN: Patrick.

1:00:52.779 --> 1:00:55.608
Patrick?
I'm a Brit, not a Mick.

1:00:55.782 --> 1:00:57.392
So, your mom's Irish.

1:00:57.566 --> 1:00:59.090
Usual affair.

1:00:59.264 --> 1:01:01.179
This time, you're
Patrick Hill from Lewisham.

1:01:01.353 --> 1:01:03.224
You've got a driver's license,
passport,

1:01:03.398 --> 1:01:05.487
IRS papers
with a full tax history,

1:01:05.662 --> 1:01:06.967
and medical records.

1:01:07.141 --> 1:01:09.187
All your criminal checks
are clean.

1:01:09.361 --> 1:01:12.451
You've got 25 years' worth
of employment,

1:01:12.625 --> 1:01:14.192
with references
working in Europe

1:01:14.366 --> 1:01:16.760
and the same for
the previous addresses, too.

1:01:16.934 --> 1:01:18.805
Your employment history
has been inserted

1:01:18.979 --> 1:01:22.156
into the Delta Orange
Security system.

1:01:22.330 --> 1:01:24.376
So, should anyone check,

1:01:24.550 --> 1:01:27.466
you've worked there
for 11 years.

1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:29.163
You even finished college,

1:01:29.337 --> 1:01:33.602
and have held the same
gym membership since 2011.

1:01:33.777 --> 1:01:37.389
As requested,
you have your pistol license,

1:01:37.563 --> 1:01:40.958
and finally,
the hotel has been arranged.

1:01:42.002 --> 1:01:43.961
It's another brand-new you.

1:01:44.570 --> 1:01:46.137
Kirsty, one more thing.

1:01:47.181 --> 1:01:49.183
Get me a copy
of the coroner's report.

1:01:52.665 --> 1:01:54.232
You sure that's a good idea?

1:01:54.406 --> 1:01:55.363
Just do it.

1:01:56.147 --> 1:01:57.539
TERRY: And your reference from

1:01:57.714 --> 1:01:59.237
Orange Delta Security
was impressive.

1:01:59.411 --> 1:02:00.368
Family?

1:02:00.542 --> 1:02:02.153
H: Married. Divorced.

1:02:02.501 --> 1:02:03.981
TERRY: Anyone else?

1:02:04.503 --> 1:02:05.809
No.

1:02:06.287 --> 1:02:08.246
TERRY: It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Hill.

1:02:12.685 --> 1:02:14.600
You ain't much for talking,
are ya, Mary Poppins?

1:02:14.774 --> 1:02:16.428
Let me buy you a beer.

1:02:17.603 --> 1:02:19.170
Just make sure
you drink it over there.

1:02:27.700 --> 1:02:29.441
-KIRSTY: The autopsy report.
-

1:02:29.615 --> 1:02:30.964
Show me your fucking hands!

1:02:31.138 --> 1:02:33.314
Face down on the ground
right now!

1:02:34.533 --> 1:02:36.100
Face to the fucking ground!

1:02:36.274 --> 1:02:37.318
DOUGIE: Please.

1:02:43.455 --> 1:02:45.283
MAN: How are you
holdin' up, Sam?

1:02:45.587 --> 1:02:47.415
What's to say?

1:02:47.589 --> 1:02:51.115
I wake up late, watch TV,

1:02:51.289 --> 1:02:53.726
drink a beer
and watch more TV.

1:02:53.900 --> 1:02:55.554
Maybe convince Ma
to give me a few bucks,

1:02:55.728 --> 1:02:57.774
so I can buy more beer and

1:02:57.948 --> 1:03:00.777
watch TV until I'm drunk
enough to fall asleep.

1:03:01.952 --> 1:03:03.867
Did I mention I watch TV?

1:03:05.912 --> 1:03:08.045
MAN: You're awfully quiet,
Brad.

1:03:08.219 --> 1:03:10.003
I'm not quiet.

1:03:10.482 --> 1:03:11.831
I'm bored.

1:03:12.005 --> 1:03:12.919
MAN: Bored of what?

1:03:13.093 --> 1:03:15.269
Not fuckin' working.

1:03:16.096 --> 1:03:20.057
We're built for combat,
not daytime TV.

1:03:22.233 --> 1:03:25.323
The Afghanis treated us better
than our own.

1:03:26.411 --> 1:03:28.674
I wish I was back in the unit.

1:03:29.588 --> 1:03:32.112
Boredom's more dangerous
than bullets.

1:03:33.722 --> 1:03:36.551
Give me an enemy
I can fuckin' see.

1:03:40.773 --> 1:03:42.470
How about you?
You workin' yet, boss?

1:03:43.341 --> 1:03:44.995
Still part-time at the mall.

1:03:45.734 --> 1:03:47.127
Costin' more than I'm making.

1:03:47.301 --> 1:03:49.434
If it wasn't
for Amy's parents,

1:03:49.608 --> 1:03:51.001
we'd be on the street.

1:03:51.175 --> 1:03:52.524
JAN: Yeah, it seems like
Carlos is the only one

1:03:52.698 --> 1:03:55.048
who landed on his feet
with the oil tycoon.

1:03:55.222 --> 1:03:58.051
So, I'm there from 6:00 in
the mornin' to 12:00 at night.

1:03:58.704 --> 1:04:00.662
This motherfucker's
drippin' in gold,

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:02.708
and I haven't seen
a dollar in overtime yet.

1:04:02.882 --> 1:04:04.101
One minute,
we're killin' Arabs,

1:04:04.275 --> 1:04:05.493
the next minute,
we're wiping their ass.

1:04:05.842 --> 1:04:07.582
Afghanis aren't Arabs.

1:04:07.756 --> 1:04:10.194
They're not? What are they?

1:04:10.716 --> 1:04:11.760
Clue's in the name.

1:04:11.935 --> 1:04:13.501
JACKSON: Afghanis.

1:04:13.675 --> 1:04:16.591
Whatever,
they're not Americans.

1:04:16.765 --> 1:04:18.637
Know what I wanna do?

1:04:19.116 --> 1:04:20.944
I wanna lift one of
those precious ornaments

1:04:21.118 --> 1:04:23.424
until I get
my motherfuckin' overtime pay.

1:04:23.598 --> 1:04:24.861
And why don't you?

1:04:26.123 --> 1:04:27.864
Why don't I what?

1:04:29.953 --> 1:04:31.824
Make them pay.

1:04:35.784 --> 1:04:36.960
They owe us.

1:04:39.049 --> 1:04:40.877
Why you askin' me?

1:04:41.529 --> 1:04:42.704
Ask Sarge.

1:04:51.626 --> 1:04:53.411
Do they keep cash?

1:05:04.770 --> 1:05:05.814
What's that?

1:05:09.906 --> 1:05:11.733
JACKSON: That is it.

1:05:13.126 --> 1:05:14.301
That's fuckin' what?

1:05:15.346 --> 1:05:16.825
JACKSON: That is what is left

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:18.740
after we washed it
through the system.

1:05:19.306 --> 1:05:20.742
SAM: What's on the table?

1:05:21.004 --> 1:05:22.527
JACKSON: 110.

1:05:23.006 --> 1:05:25.660
TOM: Two Rolexes, a Patek,

1:05:25.834 --> 1:05:28.620
6-carat ring, chains,
40 grand cash.

1:05:29.055 --> 1:05:30.404
CARLOS: Wait a minute.

1:05:30.578 --> 1:05:31.710
I got hit over the head
and lost my job

1:05:31.884 --> 1:05:34.147
for, like, 18 Gs apiece?

1:05:34.756 --> 1:05:36.889
SAM: I thought we worked out
over half a million in solids.

1:05:37.368 --> 1:05:40.588
We did the legwork,
we made the calls.

1:05:40.762 --> 1:05:41.850
BRAD: Number one.
JAN: Go ahead, four.

1:05:42.025 --> 1:05:43.200
Incoming.

1:05:43.548 --> 1:05:46.855
We spent the sweat,
we dealt with the fence.

1:05:48.248 --> 1:05:49.510
That's what we get.

1:05:50.555 --> 1:05:51.599
JAN: Salaam alaikum.

1:05:53.471 --> 1:05:54.602
JACKSON: Even split.

1:05:57.954 --> 1:06:00.304
We're not the Mafia.
We're soldiers.

1:06:00.869 --> 1:06:02.828
Nah, somethin'
ain't right here.

1:06:04.351 --> 1:06:05.570
You trying to say
something, Jan?

1:06:05.744 --> 1:06:06.919
Fuck off, Jan.

1:06:08.660 --> 1:06:09.966
Go find another bone to chew.

1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:11.619
You'll break your teeth
on this one.

1:06:11.793 --> 1:06:14.013
And stand up
when the boss is talkin'.

1:06:22.587 --> 1:06:24.458
JACKSON: We could change it,
though.

1:06:24.632 --> 1:06:25.677
Cut out the middleman.

1:06:26.634 --> 1:06:27.766
What does that mean?

1:06:29.811 --> 1:06:31.378
JACKSON: We want cash.

1:06:33.032 --> 1:06:34.555
We go after cash.

1:06:34.860 --> 1:06:36.688
We got a guy on the inside.

1:06:37.123 --> 1:06:38.385
Inside of what?

1:06:40.561 --> 1:06:41.562
Cash trucks.

1:06:45.827 --> 1:06:49.570
We took in 1.18 million.

1:06:52.182 --> 1:06:53.487
-CARLOS: That's three years'

1:06:53.661 --> 1:06:54.836
worth of work
in one day, baby!

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:59.145
That's $168,571 each.

1:06:59.319 --> 1:07:01.017
SAM: That's a lot of paper
right there.

1:07:01.191 --> 1:07:02.583
CARLOS: Hold on...
Hold on a second,

1:07:02.757 --> 1:07:05.195
that's split seven ways,
not six?

1:07:05.369 --> 1:07:06.413
BRAD: Thirty seconds.

1:07:06.718 --> 1:07:07.893
There might not be
a middleman,

1:07:08.067 --> 1:07:08.981
but there is a man
on the inside.

1:07:09.155 --> 1:07:10.156
He needs a slice.

1:07:16.554 --> 1:07:18.425
And who is this inside man?

1:07:19.948 --> 1:07:20.993
You don't need to know.

1:07:22.386 --> 1:07:24.518
JACKSON: Uh-uh-uh. Yes,
motherfuckers, these are guns,

1:07:24.692 --> 1:07:25.911
and we will not hesitate
to kill you.

1:07:26.085 --> 1:07:27.434
CARLOS:
Hands behind your back.

1:07:27.608 --> 1:07:29.045
JAN: Don't be a hero.
It's not your money.

1:07:29.219 --> 1:07:30.350
BRAD: Show me your
fuckin' hands, white boy.

1:07:30.524 --> 1:07:31.656
JAN: Put your hand
behind your back.

1:07:31.830 --> 1:07:33.049
JACKSON:
What's your driver's name?

1:07:33.353 --> 1:07:34.746
If you lie to me,
I'll fuckin' kill you.

1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:36.878
-Chad.
-JACKSON: Chad fucking what?

1:07:37.444 --> 1:07:38.358
Chad Reed.

1:07:38.532 --> 1:07:39.881
JACKSON: Horrible name.

1:07:40.056 --> 1:07:41.753
Gentlemen,
we have found our opportunity

1:07:41.927 --> 1:07:43.189
to stand tall again

1:07:44.016 --> 1:07:47.367
after years taking it
staring at our laces.

1:07:48.368 --> 1:07:50.631
Don't quit
your day job just yet.

1:07:50.805 --> 1:07:53.069
Rhythm as normal. Be smart.

1:07:53.243 --> 1:07:55.245
Don't go buying
anything flashy.

1:07:55.419 --> 1:07:57.812
Just what you absolutely need.
Do you hear me, Jan?

1:07:59.118 --> 1:08:01.251
Oh, yeah.
Loud and clear, boss.

1:08:02.078 --> 1:08:05.516
TOM: Groceries, good.
Sports cars, bad.

1:08:06.821 --> 1:08:08.475
JACKSON: This isn't
retirement money.

1:08:08.649 --> 1:08:10.260
But we play it right,
it could be.

1:08:10.434 --> 1:08:12.523
-CHAD: Yo, Dave, come in.

1:08:15.917 --> 1:08:17.397
Come in, Dave.

1:08:17.571 --> 1:08:19.225
Just checkin'
everything's as it should be.

1:08:20.008 --> 1:08:21.749
All good here, Chad.

1:08:21.923 --> 1:08:23.795
Be out in two.

1:08:25.884 --> 1:08:27.668
Did that just go as smooth
as I thought it did?

1:08:27.842 --> 1:08:29.453
Yeah, don't count
your chickens just yet.

1:08:32.978 --> 1:08:33.979
OFFICER 1: Hold up.

1:08:34.588 --> 1:08:35.850
OFFICER 2: Gentlemen.

1:08:36.024 --> 1:08:37.417
If I could just
get your signatures.

1:08:37.591 --> 1:08:39.550
-How's it goin'?
-All right.

1:08:41.856 --> 1:08:43.206
-Fantastic.
-Thank you.

1:08:44.816 --> 1:08:46.731
BRAD: I'm telling you now,

1:08:46.905 --> 1:08:49.037
there's more gold
in these hills.

1:08:49.212 --> 1:08:52.040
JAN: Yeah. And we haven't even
tapped into our skillset.

1:08:52.215 --> 1:08:54.042
BRAD: Monkeys could've
done that job.

1:08:54.217 --> 1:08:55.174
So, let's push
ourselves, then.

1:08:55.348 --> 1:08:56.262
JACKSON: Easy, boys.

1:08:56.436 --> 1:08:58.090
Walking before running.

1:08:58.786 --> 1:09:00.658
Yeah, I don't know
about you guys,

1:09:00.832 --> 1:09:01.876
but I feel like
I've been walkin'

1:09:02.050 --> 1:09:03.487
for a long fuckin' time.

1:09:03.661 --> 1:09:08.492
Happy birthday to you

1:09:08.970 --> 1:09:13.366
Happy birthday to you

1:09:13.540 --> 1:09:17.631
Happy birthday, dear Jack

1:09:17.805 --> 1:09:19.807
-MAN: Happy birthday, Daddy!

1:09:19.981 --> 1:09:24.986
Happy birthday to you

1:09:25.900 --> 1:09:28.033
-SAM: Yeah!

1:09:30.340 --> 1:09:31.428
It's gettin'
harder and harder.

1:09:34.735 --> 1:09:36.650
I know it is my birthday,

1:09:36.824 --> 1:09:39.871
but I've got
a present for you.

1:09:41.089 --> 1:09:42.656
What are you sittin' on,
old man?

1:09:42.830 --> 1:09:46.878
More work,
but with a significant bump.

1:09:47.052 --> 1:09:48.445
It's another truck.

1:09:49.185 --> 1:09:51.143
This time, there's gonna be
at least 6 mil inside.

1:09:51.578 --> 1:09:53.450
-Now, we're talkin'.

1:09:53.624 --> 1:09:56.148
SAM: Well, it's a lot more
profitable than killin' Arabs,

1:09:56.322 --> 1:09:58.019
and it makes my blood flow.

1:10:02.067 --> 1:10:03.677
Sweetheart,
what about the kids?

1:10:03.851 --> 1:10:05.026
Yeah, feed them first.

1:10:05.201 --> 1:10:06.332
Bad animals, bad.

1:10:07.899 --> 1:10:09.466
JAN: Sorry, Mrs. Ainsley.

1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:11.250
Here, let me help you with...
help you with that.

1:10:12.556 --> 1:10:14.079
JAN: Is the intel good?

1:10:15.385 --> 1:10:16.777
We got a good inside man.

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:18.518
He's one of us.

1:10:18.692 --> 1:10:19.867
Served under me
back in the day.

1:10:20.041 --> 1:10:21.347
Well, I'm in.

1:10:21.521 --> 1:10:23.219
I just wanna get back
in the field.

1:10:23.393 --> 1:10:27.527
but I fuckin' love a mission.

1:10:27.701 --> 1:10:29.050
Yeah, but what's the downside?

1:10:29.225 --> 1:10:31.183
We're gonna be
way more exposed,

1:10:31.357 --> 1:10:33.054
and it will warrant
significant planning.

1:10:33.533 --> 1:10:36.144
There will be six weeks
of training and recon.

1:11:14.095 --> 1:11:15.488
JACKSON: Three minutes.

1:11:22.974 --> 1:11:24.628
Who the fuck are these clowns?

1:11:31.069 --> 1:11:32.244
Gonna be a problem?

1:11:32.418 --> 1:11:33.724
I don't think so.

1:11:34.464 --> 1:11:36.074
Five, on the car. Handle it.

1:11:36.248 --> 1:11:37.249
On it.

1:11:39.077 --> 1:11:40.383
Time to go to work, boys.

1:11:42.776 --> 1:11:44.909
You gotta get
these hinges greased, Mick.

1:11:50.131 --> 1:11:51.655
CHARLIE: What is this?

1:11:59.706 --> 1:12:00.838
MICK: Freeway's
gonna be backed up.

1:12:01.012 --> 1:12:02.013
CHARLIE: Oh, fuck!
MICK: Shit!

1:12:04.668 --> 1:12:05.669
Let's go! Reverse! Reverse!

1:12:14.895 --> 1:12:15.896
Unit 14, clear.

1:12:16.070 --> 1:12:17.071
TOM: Still no response.

1:12:23.556 --> 1:12:24.601
JAN: Thirty seconds.

1:12:28.648 --> 1:12:30.694
SAM: Yo, out of
the fuckin' car, come on!

1:12:30.868 --> 1:12:32.435
Don't fuckin' look at me!
Out of the fuckin' car!

1:12:32.609 --> 1:12:34.045
BRAD: They don't pay you
enough to act a fool, let's go.

1:12:34.219 --> 1:12:35.176
Get your motherfucking
ass down.

1:12:35.351 --> 1:12:36.743
CHARLIE: All right! All right!

1:12:36.917 --> 1:12:37.918
OPERATOR 2: Fortico 1377.
Alarm raised.

1:12:38.092 --> 1:12:39.267
TOM: Alarm registered.

1:12:39.442 --> 1:12:40.486
SAM: Face to
the fucking ground!

1:12:40.660 --> 1:12:41.879
JAN: Tires, now.
JACKSON: Move!

1:12:44.272 --> 1:12:45.491
JAN: Do what we say
and you fucking live.

1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:47.885
OPERATOR 2: Bravo,
two black-and-whites en route.

1:12:48.059 --> 1:12:49.843
-Two minutes away.
-TOM: Two units dispatched.

1:12:54.979 --> 1:12:56.241
Don't do it.

1:12:56.415 --> 1:12:57.068
ETA, two minutes.

1:12:57.242 --> 1:12:58.286
JAN: Two minutes!

1:12:58.461 --> 1:13:00.071
-

1:13:00.245 --> 1:13:01.377
-MICK: Come on, Charlie!
-

1:13:03.422 --> 1:13:04.771
CHARLIE: No! No...

1:13:05.511 --> 1:13:06.817
Fuck!

1:13:06.991 --> 1:13:08.035
TOM: He shot
two fucking guards, Elvis.

1:13:08.209 --> 1:13:09.385
He shot two fucking guards!

1:13:09.559 --> 1:13:10.473
JACKSON: Number one,
are we good?

1:13:12.562 --> 1:13:14.172
Are we good,
number one?

1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:15.826
We're good.

1:13:28.795 --> 1:13:30.580
TOM: Number one just shot
a fuckin' kid!

1:13:30.754 --> 1:13:31.885
He shot a fuckin' kid!

1:13:32.059 --> 1:13:33.452
H: Dougie!

1:13:33.626 --> 1:13:35.019
TOM: Incoming!
Incoming on the right!

1:13:35.193 --> 1:13:36.673
JACKSON: Five, incoming!
SAM: I'm on it!

1:13:36.847 --> 1:13:38.805
-JACKSON: Take the legs!
-

1:13:40.154 --> 1:13:41.982
SAM: What the fuck
did you just do?

1:13:42.374 --> 1:13:43.941
JACKSON:
I said the fucking legs.

1:13:44.115 --> 1:13:45.595
Three, take his gun.

1:13:45.769 --> 1:13:46.683
Okay, we got one minute.

1:13:46.987 --> 1:13:47.945
Let's go!

1:13:48.119 --> 1:13:50.077
-Move.
-TOM: Exit west!

1:13:50.251 --> 1:13:51.862
-We gotta go, Elvis! Come on!
-JACKSON: What the fuck?

1:13:52.036 --> 1:13:53.254
-Let's get out of here.
-BRAD: Let's move. Move, move!

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:54.299
CARLOS:
B-team, let's go, let's go!

1:14:36.297 --> 1:14:37.473
JAN: Gotta tell you, man.

1:14:37.777 --> 1:14:39.475
Was surprised
to hear from you.

1:14:39.649 --> 1:14:41.128
Glad we could all make it.

1:14:42.739 --> 1:14:45.132
JAN: Yeah, I'm glad
that shit blew over.

1:14:45.306 --> 1:14:46.960
JACKSON: You put us
in a tight spot, Jan.

1:14:47.134 --> 1:14:49.267
I'm not sure
it has all blown over.

1:14:49.789 --> 1:14:51.574
You're lucky you still got
a seat at this table.

1:14:53.489 --> 1:14:54.881
Got it.

1:14:59.538 --> 1:15:01.758
I think we all know we're
gonna need a pension fund.

1:15:01.932 --> 1:15:03.977
I can't say I wasn't pleased
to have this meeting.

1:15:04.151 --> 1:15:05.675
I was startin' to itch.

1:15:05.849 --> 1:15:07.241
But as we are aware,

1:15:07.415 --> 1:15:09.853
the bigger the reward,
the bigger the risk.

1:15:10.331 --> 1:15:11.681
Everything comes at a price.

1:15:11.855 --> 1:15:13.552
JACKSON:
Are you ready for that?

1:15:13.726 --> 1:15:16.424
'Cause there is no guarantee
of success on this one.

1:15:18.296 --> 1:15:20.733
None of this was ever really
guaranteed, was it, Sarge?

1:15:22.953 --> 1:15:24.432
We've been through worse.

1:15:24.737 --> 1:15:25.869
Yeah, so lay it on us.

1:15:26.043 --> 1:15:27.348
We're dyin' to find out.

1:15:28.175 --> 1:15:30.221
We do this right,

1:15:30.917 --> 1:15:32.789
we'll never
have to work again.

1:15:32.963 --> 1:15:34.225
Neither will our kids.

1:15:34.399 --> 1:15:35.792
If we get it wrong?

1:15:35.966 --> 1:15:37.750
It's game over.

1:15:40.623 --> 1:15:42.363
So, what is it?

1:15:44.801 --> 1:15:47.499
We're not hitting
a cash truck.

1:15:47.673 --> 1:15:49.240
We're hitting them all.

1:15:50.284 --> 1:15:51.547
How is that possible?

1:15:52.809 --> 1:15:54.462
The depot.

1:15:54.854 --> 1:15:55.899
Black Friday.

1:15:59.293 --> 1:16:00.468
How much?

1:16:01.295 --> 1:16:03.384
North of 150 million.

1:16:03.733 --> 1:16:05.169
Ooh!

1:16:09.434 --> 1:16:11.262
JACKSON: We've got eight weeks
of recon and planning.

1:16:15.222 --> 1:16:17.834
Base, this is Gamma reportin'.

1:16:24.231 --> 1:16:28.845
JOHN: Incoming vehicle,
Gamma 2411 to Bay 6.

1:16:44.077 --> 1:16:47.733
That's 160 million
divided seven ways.

1:16:48.212 --> 1:16:49.735
We have every avenue covered.

1:16:49.909 --> 1:16:51.258
Incomin', Mr. Rossi.

1:16:51.432 --> 1:16:53.173
TERRY: Thank you, Mr. Hill.
Sign it in.

1:16:53.347 --> 1:16:54.827
JACKSON:
This is our best plan.

1:16:55.001 --> 1:16:56.742
Yeah.
All this is for nothing

1:16:56.916 --> 1:16:58.526
if our guy
doesn't come through.

1:16:59.092 --> 1:17:01.355
Why does this room
always smell so good?

1:17:01.529 --> 1:17:03.488
Maybe one day,
my garden can smell like this.

1:17:03.662 --> 1:17:05.925
I hope you're not
plannin' anything, Dave.

1:17:06.099 --> 1:17:07.623
DAVE: Well, it's Black Friday
tomorrow,

1:17:08.058 --> 1:17:09.668
so you'll have
to wait and see.

1:17:09.842 --> 1:17:10.974
If I thought you were serious,

1:17:11.148 --> 1:17:12.149
I'd have to report you,
you know.

1:17:12.540 --> 1:17:13.977
'Course I'm not serious.

1:17:14.151 --> 1:17:15.543
Or am I?

1:17:17.023 --> 1:17:19.373
Anyway, it's Action Man
you gotta look out for,

1:17:19.547 --> 1:17:20.505
not me.

1:17:20.679 --> 1:17:22.420
Yeah, colder than a reptile.

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:24.901
Something's not right.

1:17:25.075 --> 1:17:26.424
But why do I get the feeling

1:17:26.598 --> 1:17:28.252
your money's never been safer,
Mr. Rossi?

1:17:28.426 --> 1:17:29.949
JACKSON:
You don't need to worry.

1:17:30.123 --> 1:17:31.647
He's greedier than you, Tom.
He'll come through.

1:17:33.126 --> 1:17:34.824
Okay, let's run through it
one more time.

1:17:39.219 --> 1:17:41.004
Has anyone seen my clutch?

1:17:41.178 --> 1:17:42.266
Your... Your what?

1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:43.789
My purse, sweetheart.

1:17:43.963 --> 1:17:45.225
Uh, there's a green one
on the landing.

1:17:45.399 --> 1:17:47.401
-Thank you, Lexie.
-Oh, yeah. Come on.

1:17:47.575 --> 1:17:48.794
What are you doing today, Dad?

1:17:48.968 --> 1:17:50.927
-Uh, I got work.
-At the mall?

1:17:51.101 --> 1:17:52.276
JACKSON: That's right.

1:17:52.450 --> 1:17:53.625
Will you come
to my game after?

1:17:53.799 --> 1:17:55.453
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1:17:55.627 --> 1:17:56.759
-AMY: Okay, let's go!
-Come on, Mom, let's go.

1:17:56.933 --> 1:17:58.064
-Love you, Dad!
-Bye. Love you!

1:17:58.238 --> 1:17:59.631
-Bye, Dad!
-JACKSON: Love you.

1:17:59.805 --> 1:18:00.414
AMY: Love you, honey.
JACKSON: I love you.

1:18:00.588 --> 1:18:01.198
LEXIE: Come on!

1:18:01.415 --> 1:18:02.286
JACKSON: Hey...

1:18:03.287 --> 1:18:05.071
I'm gonna be late for work.

1:18:05.245 --> 1:18:06.159
JACKSON: I love you.

1:18:06.333 --> 1:18:07.726
LEXIE: Hurry up, Mom!

1:18:08.553 --> 1:18:10.033
Okay, bye!

1:18:11.556 --> 1:18:12.470
-Come on, kids,

1:18:12.644 --> 1:18:13.732
get in the car!

1:18:15.081 --> 1:18:17.083
-CAR ENGINE STARTS

1:18:21.653 --> 1:18:22.872
Go.

1:18:23.046 --> 1:18:24.656
JACKSON:
We're all set on our end.

1:18:24.830 --> 1:18:27.485
I'm on my way to pick up Jan.

1:18:27.659 --> 1:18:29.530
Now, it's all up to you.

1:18:32.098 --> 1:18:33.404
SUPER: Remember,

1:18:33.578 --> 1:18:35.536
take different routes
there and back.

1:18:35.711 --> 1:18:39.366
Even a sniff of anything
untoward and you call it in.

1:18:39.540 --> 1:18:43.283
This is Black Friday, and
the tills will keep ringin'.

1:18:43.457 --> 1:18:45.677
So, don't take no chances.

1:18:45.851 --> 1:18:49.768
We got close to 180 million
comin' in here today.

1:18:51.074 --> 1:18:52.945
-Have you got it?
-EMPLOYEES: Got it, boss!

1:18:54.164 --> 1:18:57.558
I want everything
and everyone back.

1:18:57.733 --> 1:18:59.604
Safe and sound.

1:18:59.778 --> 1:19:01.562
BULLET: Let's get goin', H.

1:19:10.310 --> 1:19:11.442
JAN: What?

1:19:12.008 --> 1:19:13.705
You don't like it?

1:19:13.966 --> 1:19:17.100
How does someone like you
afford a place like this

1:19:17.274 --> 1:19:19.798
and a $28,000 bike?

1:19:20.668 --> 1:19:22.322
Credit card.

1:19:22.627 --> 1:19:24.237
Calm down,
it's not in my name.

1:19:24.411 --> 1:19:25.456
Return it.

1:19:28.154 --> 1:19:30.330
Put the beers down,
grab your gear, and let's go.

1:19:32.376 --> 1:19:33.769
Let's go!

1:19:47.043 --> 1:19:48.131
BULLET:
That's the last drop-off.

1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:10.675
-What is it?

1:20:13.243 --> 1:20:15.201
You know I like you, right, H?

1:20:18.552 --> 1:20:21.251
Well, there's somethin'
I need to tell you.

1:20:21.425 --> 1:20:23.209
About me.

1:20:25.124 --> 1:20:27.083
I've got some friends.

1:20:27.953 --> 1:20:29.781
I help 'em out.

1:20:30.956 --> 1:20:32.958
They help me out
from time to time.

1:20:35.308 --> 1:20:36.614
My pals,

1:20:37.571 --> 1:20:40.487
I helped 'em get
into the cash truck game,

1:20:40.661 --> 1:20:42.489
in a manner of speaking.

1:20:43.969 --> 1:20:45.841
With me on the inside.

1:20:47.233 --> 1:20:48.539
You get me?

1:20:50.541 --> 1:20:51.672
Nah, Bullet,

1:20:53.370 --> 1:20:54.545
I don't.

1:20:55.546 --> 1:20:57.940
I tell them
which trucks to hit

1:20:58.766 --> 1:21:00.203
and they hit 'em.

1:21:01.726 --> 1:21:04.468
The two guards being killed
was necessary.

1:21:05.251 --> 1:21:07.340
The boy was unfortunate.

1:21:09.038 --> 1:21:11.083
But we're a winning team.

1:21:11.257 --> 1:21:13.433
Militarily precise.

1:21:16.306 --> 1:21:18.177
You with me now?

1:21:18.743 --> 1:21:20.005
Yeah.

1:21:22.355 --> 1:21:24.836
I'm with you 100%.

1:21:26.272 --> 1:21:27.752
Continue.

1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:30.581
For starters, there are
no bullets in your gun.

1:21:30.973 --> 1:21:32.583
Secondly, I have to tell you,

1:21:32.757 --> 1:21:35.412
they will kill you
if you don't comply.

1:21:35.586 --> 1:21:38.067
So, do as I say,
and you won't get hurt.

1:21:41.635 --> 1:21:42.985
And why do you need me?

1:21:43.463 --> 1:21:45.683
We need somethin' super-sized.

1:21:46.510 --> 1:21:48.555
So we can walk away for good.

1:21:50.340 --> 1:21:52.429
We want the jackpot.

1:21:54.779 --> 1:21:56.607
The depot.

1:21:57.695 --> 1:21:59.044
You want me to get you in.

1:21:59.697 --> 1:22:01.960
Then you can look
the other way.

1:22:04.615 --> 1:22:06.095
When, Bullet?

1:22:07.923 --> 1:22:09.402
Today.

1:22:10.882 --> 1:22:13.058
There's no turning back.

1:22:14.842 --> 1:22:16.583
And what's in it for me?

1:22:18.585 --> 1:22:19.586
Your life.

1:22:25.679 --> 1:22:26.985
Do we have a deal?

1:22:34.166 --> 1:22:35.428
Yeah.

1:22:35.863 --> 1:22:37.126
We have a deal.

1:22:42.566 --> 1:22:43.871
We're on. ETA, two minutes.

1:22:44.046 --> 1:22:45.177
Covers.

1:23:17.035 --> 1:23:19.211
JOHN: Gamma, this is Base,
you copy? Over.

1:23:21.561 --> 1:23:23.520
Base, this is Gamma,
we copy. Over.

1:23:23.694 --> 1:23:25.478
Gamma, I've lost
camera signal in your truck.

1:23:25.652 --> 1:23:27.219
What's happenin' there? Over.

1:23:27.393 --> 1:23:28.655
BULLET: It's nothing
to worry about, Base.

1:23:28.829 --> 1:23:30.309
I'm fixin' it as we speak.

1:23:30.483 --> 1:23:32.877
JOHN: Copy that, Gamma.
Keep me updated.

1:23:33.051 --> 1:23:34.052
This ain't the day
for this shit,

1:23:34.226 --> 1:23:35.532
you understand me? Over.

1:23:35.706 --> 1:23:36.924
Loud and clear.

1:23:37.099 --> 1:23:39.101
I'll be in touch as soon as.
Over.

1:23:43.061 --> 1:23:44.367
We're set.

1:23:44.541 --> 1:23:45.759
Cameras are disarmed.

1:23:45.933 --> 1:23:48.936
We have four minutes to load.

1:23:49.111 --> 1:23:50.982
JACKSON:
We meet here at point A.

1:23:51.635 --> 1:23:53.593
Warn our hero
not to get clever.

1:23:53.941 --> 1:23:55.247
We'll need him to get inside.

1:23:55.421 --> 1:23:56.770
After that,
if he twitches, kill him.

1:24:03.386 --> 1:24:05.779
Just let 'em do their jobs,
okay?

1:24:05.953 --> 1:24:07.694
Let me talk to him.

1:24:09.479 --> 1:24:11.089
-Hey, handsome.

1:24:11.263 --> 1:24:14.962
Today is not the day
to be a hero.

1:24:15.137 --> 1:24:17.182
There will be
no other warnings.

1:24:17.617 --> 1:24:20.403
Am I clear?

1:24:20.968 --> 1:24:23.058
Show me your hands.

1:24:25.799 --> 1:24:27.366
BULLET: Play the game, H.

1:24:45.993 --> 1:24:47.691
If you're a good boy today,

1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:50.694
you'll see tomorrow.

1:25:03.750 --> 1:25:05.187
Then, we divide.

1:25:05.361 --> 1:25:07.885
You, Brad, Carlos, and Jan
are in the truck.

1:25:08.059 --> 1:25:10.148
Me and Sam
follow in the Escalade.

1:25:37.958 --> 1:25:38.959
Be cool, H.

1:25:39.438 --> 1:25:41.310
2411 returning.

1:25:41.484 --> 1:25:43.616
Gamma, this is Base, go. Over.

1:25:59.284 --> 1:26:00.720
All good?

1:26:00.894 --> 1:26:02.069
Yeah, except for traffic.

1:26:02.244 --> 1:26:03.288
DAVE: Dana,
come give me a hand.

1:26:03.462 --> 1:26:05.247
-DANA: Yeah, no problem.
-Right.

1:26:05.421 --> 1:26:07.074
Let's relieve you
of your burden.

1:26:14.865 --> 1:26:16.954
Base, this is Gamma reporting.

1:26:23.395 --> 1:26:24.657
All clear, Gamma.

1:26:26.224 --> 1:26:27.225
You ready?

1:26:28.618 --> 1:26:29.749
Ready.

1:26:31.055 --> 1:26:33.666
Gamma 2411 to Bay 5.

1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:35.190
That's the last one for today.

1:26:35.364 --> 1:26:36.974
TOM: Once we get
past the gates,

1:26:37.148 --> 1:26:38.715
it's only a question of time
before we're compromised.

1:26:38.889 --> 1:26:40.673
There's too many guards
that we can't control,

1:26:40.847 --> 1:26:42.762
so we keep it quiet
as long as possible.

1:26:42.936 --> 1:26:44.721
JACKSON:
The men must be stealthy.

1:26:44.895 --> 1:26:47.506
The longer their stealth, the
longer we live without drama.

1:26:47.941 --> 1:26:49.813
Hey, Bullet. All good?

1:26:49.987 --> 1:26:51.249
All good here, Supe.

1:26:52.076 --> 1:26:54.948
Move. Move. Now, move! Go!

1:26:55.122 --> 1:26:56.689
OFFICER: Whoa... Whoa.
JAN: Uh-uh-uh.

1:26:56.863 --> 1:26:58.561
Don't you
fuckin' make a sound.

1:26:58.735 --> 1:26:59.736
Down on the ground.

1:26:59.910 --> 1:27:00.911
TOM: Move.

1:27:01.694 --> 1:27:03.000
MAN: Okay, I'm down.

1:27:03.957 --> 1:27:05.307
JACKSON:
Tiptoe, tiptoe, tiptoe.

1:27:05.481 --> 1:27:07.178
We secure the safe first.

1:27:07.352 --> 1:27:09.006
That's Carlos and Jan's job.

1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:11.008
TERRY: Okay, Dave, that's
all good and accounted for.

1:27:11.182 --> 1:27:12.401
CARLOS: Hands in the air!

1:27:12.575 --> 1:27:13.880
Hands in
the motherfuckin' air!

1:27:14.054 --> 1:27:14.968
Toss your weapons
on the ground.

1:27:15.142 --> 1:27:16.187
Slowly. Slowly.

1:27:16.361 --> 1:27:17.928
Do what he says.
Do what he says.

1:27:18.102 --> 1:27:19.669
CARLOS: Take that weapon out.
Slide it over.

1:27:19.843 --> 1:27:21.366
Get over there!
Get on the fuckin' ground!

1:27:21.758 --> 1:27:23.194
The fuck is wrong with you?

1:27:23.368 --> 1:27:24.717
Grab your gun,
put it on the ground,

1:27:24.891 --> 1:27:26.545
and kick it to me,
motherfucker!

1:27:26.719 --> 1:27:27.938
-TERRY: David, please.
-You wanna be a hero today?

1:27:28.112 --> 1:27:29.766
I'll put you on the front page

1:27:29.940 --> 1:27:31.158
of every fuckin' newspaper
in America. Try me.

1:27:36.555 --> 1:27:37.600
Get on the ground.

1:27:38.514 --> 1:27:39.515
All the way!

1:27:40.690 --> 1:27:41.865
Get your fuckin' ass
on the ground!

1:27:42.039 --> 1:27:43.432
Tie his ass up.

1:27:49.525 --> 1:27:51.396
-JAN: Behave yourself.

1:27:53.311 --> 1:27:55.008
-Hey.
-STUART: What's up?

1:27:55.182 --> 1:27:57.402
Yo, I need you to sign this
birthday card for the boss.

1:27:57.576 --> 1:27:59.012
Bring it up here
and have a look at this.

1:27:59.186 --> 1:28:00.884
This will make you laugh.

1:28:01.058 --> 1:28:02.929
JACKSON: You, Jan, and Brad
will take the control room.

1:28:03.103 --> 1:28:05.280
-Bullet is hostage and shield.
-Shh.

1:28:06.977 --> 1:28:08.370
If that doesn't work,
we blow our way in.

1:28:09.675 --> 1:28:11.024
Keep it fucking quiet.

1:28:16.508 --> 1:28:17.509
JAN: Open the gate.
MAN: Whoa.

1:28:20.556 --> 1:28:21.557
ARMOURER: Bob?

1:28:21.731 --> 1:28:23.733
What the fuck is goin' on?

1:28:23.907 --> 1:28:25.561
JACKSON: The keypad
will present a challenge.

1:28:25.735 --> 1:28:28.041
The men that operate
the armory are hard-boiled.

1:28:28.215 --> 1:28:29.956
They will not be scared
of pulling the trigger.

1:28:30.130 --> 1:28:31.262
At some point, they'll resist.

1:28:31.828 --> 1:28:33.656
JAN: Open the gate,

1:28:33.830 --> 1:28:35.788
or I'll blow
his fuckin' head off.

1:28:36.441 --> 1:28:38.922
You have three seconds.

1:28:39.096 --> 1:28:40.315
One!

1:28:40.489 --> 1:28:42.360
Two! Three!

1:28:42.534 --> 1:28:44.406
Okay! Putting the gun down!

1:28:44.667 --> 1:28:45.798
JAN: Open the gate.

1:28:45.972 --> 1:28:47.060
ARMOURER:
The keypad is out there.

1:28:47.234 --> 1:28:48.584
JAN: You use the keypad.

1:28:48.758 --> 1:28:50.063
ARMOURER:
It's on security lockdown!

1:28:50.237 --> 1:28:52.109
You use the fuckin' keypad!

1:28:53.284 --> 1:28:55.286
BRAD: The rabbits have run,
number one.

1:28:55.460 --> 1:28:57.419
JAN: Two, breach the gate.

1:28:57.593 --> 1:28:59.159
At some point, we're gonna
come under heavy fire.

1:28:59.334 --> 1:29:00.770
They got long guns,
they're gonna use 'em.

1:29:00.987 --> 1:29:02.902
Here you go.
Here, take this, chief.

1:29:03.076 --> 1:29:04.295
So, we'll need
ballistic plates.

1:29:04.469 --> 1:29:06.341
JAN: This is your last chance.

1:29:07.820 --> 1:29:09.431
I'll blow his head off.

1:29:09.605 --> 1:29:11.563
Bob, open the gate, or they're
gonna fuckin' kill me!

1:29:11.737 --> 1:29:12.999
Bullet, get down!

1:29:17.003 --> 1:29:18.265
Holy shit!

1:29:20.616 --> 1:29:21.921
BRAD: Set!

1:29:26.926 --> 1:29:28.101
CARLOS: Nobody fuckin' move!

1:29:28.275 --> 1:29:29.364
Number three, what's goin' on?

1:29:32.367 --> 1:29:33.542
BRAD: Don't do it!

1:29:37.110 --> 1:29:38.938
JOHN: Jesus fuckin' Christ!

1:29:43.029 --> 1:29:44.161
ARMOURER: Now!

1:29:55.390 --> 1:29:56.826
TOM: Move now! Move!

1:30:21.807 --> 1:30:23.243
-

1:30:23.418 --> 1:30:25.071
-TOM: Where are you hit?

1:30:25.245 --> 1:30:26.246
Where are you hit?

1:30:27.030 --> 1:30:30.033
Four is down.
Elvis, repeat, four is down.

1:30:36.343 --> 1:30:37.606
JOHN: Oh, no! No, no, no!

1:30:37.780 --> 1:30:39.085
No, Jesus,
sweet Mary and Joseph,

1:30:39.259 --> 1:30:40.696
I swear to God! Please...

1:30:40.870 --> 1:30:42.480
JAN: Mm, look at
this little piggy...

1:30:42.654 --> 1:30:45.048
JOHN: Please, don't.
I got kids, please. Please!

1:30:45.222 --> 1:30:46.832
JAN: What do we
have here, huh? Motherfucker.

1:30:47.006 --> 1:30:48.921
-JOHN: Don't hurt me! Please!
-

1:30:49.095 --> 1:30:51.620
-

1:30:51.794 --> 1:30:52.838
Enough of that.

1:30:56.625 --> 1:30:58.801
Elvis, come and play.

1:31:04.633 --> 1:31:06.461
...a bike from an open garage.

1:31:06.635 --> 1:31:08.941
Officers have now located
the suspect and the bicycle...

1:31:12.858 --> 1:31:14.947
JACKSON: One, sweep
the rest of the building.

1:31:15.121 --> 1:31:16.166
JAN: Copy.

1:31:24.217 --> 1:31:25.392
JACKSON: Five, are we good?

1:31:25.567 --> 1:31:27.090
TOM: Clear, Elvis. Move in.

1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:31.486
Traffic
stopped on Highland and Third.

1:31:34.619 --> 1:31:36.316
-CARLOS: Welcome to the party.

1:31:37.187 --> 1:31:39.494
These three are hog-tied.
The guap is in here.

1:31:40.190 --> 1:31:41.931
And another three guards
in the back.

1:31:42.105 --> 1:31:44.063
OPERATOR: Fortico, reported
robbery. SWAT alerted.

1:31:44.237 --> 1:31:46.022
JACKSON:
SWAT have been alerted.

1:32:00.819 --> 1:32:01.951
OPERATOR:
SWAT has been notified.

1:32:02.125 --> 1:32:03.909
All units, please respond.

1:32:05.868 --> 1:32:08.174
JACKSON:
Once the alarm sounds,

1:32:08.348 --> 1:32:10.742
black-and-whites will be
on scene within minutes,

1:32:10.916 --> 1:32:12.614
but they cannot
enter the building.

1:32:12.788 --> 1:32:14.964
Even if they could,
they wouldn't dare.

1:32:15.138 --> 1:32:17.096
However,
they are not our problem.

1:32:17.270 --> 1:32:20.186
We will have eight minutes
until SWAT arrives.

1:32:23.015 --> 1:32:24.190
We can punch through
the black-and-whites

1:32:24.364 --> 1:32:26.018
with an 18-ton cash truck,

1:32:26.192 --> 1:32:27.759
but the SWAT truck's
a different story.

1:32:27.933 --> 1:32:29.761
We cannot get pinned down.

1:32:29.935 --> 1:32:32.111
We gotta get out
before they seal the exit.

1:32:32.285 --> 1:32:34.200
We're eight minutes out.
Eight minutes out.

1:32:34.374 --> 1:32:35.985
STUART: We have men down.
Send backup right now!

1:32:36.159 --> 1:32:37.334
This is an emergency.

1:32:37.508 --> 1:32:38.422
They have
heavy assault weapons,

1:32:38.596 --> 1:32:40.119
and they have body armor.

1:32:40.293 --> 1:32:41.773
-Men are down.
-SWATMAN: Hold your positions.

1:32:41.947 --> 1:32:42.774

1:34:51.642 --> 1:34:52.991
That gun will do nothing!

1:34:53.165 --> 1:34:54.601
And this is not your money.

1:34:54.776 --> 1:34:55.777

1:35:16.275 --> 1:35:18.582
JACKSON: One, four is down.

1:35:18.756 --> 1:35:21.150
I repeat, four is down.
Do you have eyes on three?

1:35:22.804 --> 1:35:23.892
Three, respond.

The SWAT team, they're on
the way. They're on the way.

1:35:50.527 --> 1:35:51.789
Well, if someone
comes down the hallway,

1:35:51.963 --> 1:35:53.269
I'm gonna
fuckin' shoot 'em, Terry!

1:35:53.443 --> 1:35:54.313

-David, you all right?

1:38:20.111 --> 1:38:21.330
JACKSON:
We're sitting ducks here.

1:38:28.467 --> 1:38:30.382
Stuart. Give me a gun.

OPERATOR: On fence perimeter

1:40:21.058 --> 1:40:23.626
-You good?
-We're good. Let's go.

1:40:44.473 --> 1:40:46.692
TOM: Once the truck is loaded
and we're all in,

1:40:46.866 --> 1:40:48.172
we punch through
the black-and-whites.

1:40:48.694 --> 1:40:50.087
Exit right.

1:40:50.261 --> 1:40:52.872
They and the choppers
will be in pursuit,

1:40:53.395 --> 1:40:55.440
but there's nothing
they can do to stop us.

1:40:56.180 --> 1:40:58.182
OFFICER 1: Oh, shit!
They're not stopping!

1:40:58.617 --> 1:40:59.879

-OFFICER 2: Heading west!

1:41:00.054 --> 1:41:01.359

1:41:24.513 --> 1:41:25.862
to enter building D.

1:41:26.036 --> 1:41:28.212
The gates here will stop
any immediate intrusion.

1:41:28.386 --> 1:41:30.432
OPERATOR: Heading south
on 405. We have visual.

1:41:30.606 --> 1:41:31.955
We have four birds in the sky.

Air units in the vicinity.

1:41:33.739 --> 1:41:34.784
OPERATOR 2:

1:41:34.958 --> 1:41:36.351
That doesn't change a thing.

Just stick to the plan.

1:41:40.311 --> 1:41:41.356
Get ready.

1:41:58.024 --> 1:42:01.637
JACKSON: We will have five
minutes until SWAT breaches.

1:42:01.811 --> 1:42:03.421
They will think we're trapped.
They will shoot to kill,

1:42:03.595 --> 1:42:04.857
but we won't be there.

1:42:05.031 --> 1:42:06.381
And there's no way
that they can know

1:42:06.555 --> 1:42:08.252
about this access tunnel
underneath the basement?

1:42:08.426 --> 1:42:10.385
JACKSON: No, this doesn't
come up on any blueprints.

1:42:10.559 --> 1:42:12.169
They stopped printing this
back in '57.

1:42:12.343 --> 1:42:13.605
OFFICER 1:
We have 'em surrounded.

1:42:13.779 --> 1:42:15.477

Into position.

1:42:30.056 --> 1:42:31.667
Gonna make it.

Get back there
and finish the job.

1:42:33.843 --> 1:42:35.410
OFFICER 2: We are stationary
and setting up a blockade.

Awaiting further orders.

1:42:40.110 --> 1:42:41.198
Go.

1:42:44.375 --> 1:42:45.942
That's the last of it.
Let's move.

1:42:46.116 --> 1:42:47.726
OPERATOR: All units,
you are cleared to fire.

1:42:47.900 --> 1:42:49.075

1:43:03.525 --> 1:43:04.961
Targets have intent to kill

-JAN: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-

1:43:10.009 --> 1:43:12.447
Not gonna need that,
are we now, Sarge?

1:43:38.429 --> 1:43:41.040
JACKSON:
We all understand the risks.

1:43:41.302 --> 1:43:42.868
Some of us won't make it.

1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.437
If there is
a last man standing,

1:43:46.611 --> 1:43:49.353
it's his job
to take care of the families.

1:43:49.527 --> 1:43:51.834
TOM: I wish I was confident
that will happen,

1:43:52.008 --> 1:43:54.402
but my only concern is Jan.

1:43:55.098 --> 1:43:57.361
Strange things happen to men

1:43:57.535 --> 1:43:59.624
when they smell
that much cash.

1:44:00.538 --> 1:44:01.844
He's a soldier.

1:44:02.018 --> 1:44:04.150
In the end,
he'll follow orders.

1:44:07.937 --> 1:44:08.807
Where's the sarge?

1:44:08.981 --> 1:44:10.287
He's not comin'.

1:44:10.461 --> 1:44:11.984
What do you mean,
"He's not coming"?

1:44:12.158 --> 1:44:14.378
I mean he's fuckin' dead,

1:44:46.192 --> 1:44:48.369
load the cash under cover.

-Uh-uh-uh-uh.

There's a network
