LONG-TIME COMPANION.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.381

01:20.414 --> 01:23.517
SO YOU'RE DETECTIVE TUTOLA'S
BETTER HALF?

01:23.551 --> 01:26.354
I HEAR HE CAN BE...
PRICKLY.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.755
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
MEET HIM?

01:27.788 --> 01:29.357
- WE'RE WORKING UP TO IT.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.459
- I JUST WANT
TO START THE RELATIONSHIP OFF

01:31.492 --> 01:33.327
ON THE RIGHT FOOT.

01:33.361 --> 01:36.597
- OKAY, YOU CAME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.266
SALUD.

01:38.299 --> 01:41.469
- SO I SHOULD JUST
BE MYSELF WITH HIM?

01:41.502 --> 01:43.671
- YES.

01:43.704 --> 01:47.475
HE MAY SEEM IMPOSING,
BUT THERE'S A LOT

01:47.508 --> 01:49.643
OF DEPTH THERE
AND HEART.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.612
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT.
- [chuckles]

01:51.645 --> 01:54.248
THANK YOU.
I HAVE A NIGHT SHIFT.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.484
HE GETS TO GO HOME
AND WATCH TOP CHEF.

02:00.188 --> 02:03.357
- YOU KNOW, YOUR DAD'S
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.758
HE SAYS IT
ALL THE TIME.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.794
- HE DOES?
- YEAH.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.830

GOOD LUCK.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.712

02:24.745 --> 02:27.648
[grunting and struggling]

02:27.681 --> 02:30.684
[grunting]

02:30.718 --> 02:32.486
- HOLA, ALEJANDRO.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.954
YOU IN THE MOOD
FOR LOVE?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.790
OYE.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.529
GET HIS PANTS.

02:41.562 --> 02:44.565

02:46.834 --> 02:49.803
[theme music]

02:49.837 --> 02:57.845
*

03:34.548 --> 03:37.418
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, KEN?
- I NEED MY DAD.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.832
- WHEN I CAME TO,

03:51.865 --> 03:56.337
I WAS
IN THIS EMPTY APARTMENT.

03:56.370 --> 03:59.006
THEY BEAT ME.

03:59.039 --> 04:03.311
[whimpers]
SODOMIZED ME.

04:03.344 --> 04:07.548
THEY LEFT ME FOR DEAD
ON THE SIDEWALK.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.517
- DID YOU GET A LOOK
AT 'EM?

04:09.550 --> 04:12.353
- JUST THE TWO
WHO JUMPED ME.

04:12.386 --> 04:16.924
TEENAGERS, HISPANIC.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.326
[sighs]

04:18.359 --> 04:19.693
AFTER THAT,
THEY PUT A HOOD ON ME.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.396
- AND HOW MANY
WERE IN THE APARTMENT?

04:22.430 --> 04:25.699
- FOUR, I THINK--
FROM THE VOICES.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.336
- WERE THEY SPEAKING
ENGLISH OR SPANISH?

04:28.369 --> 04:29.803
- SPANGLISH.

04:29.837 --> 04:34.975
I'D SAY DOMINICAN,
STREET.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.944
THEY KNEW MY NAME.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.381
- ALEJANDRO, DO YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT THE VAN?

04:40.414 --> 04:43.784
- DARK.
THAT'S ALL.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.653
- OKAY.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.321
- WAIT.

04:47.355 --> 04:50.791
I LISTED KEN
AS NEXT OF KIN.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.993
DON'T TELL MY FAMILY
I'M HERE.

04:53.026 --> 04:56.063
- WE UNDERSTAND.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.400
- DAD, HE'S MORE
THAN JUST A FRIEND.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.534
- I UNDERSTAND, KEN.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.603
HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.904
- FIANCE.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.774
THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.615
- OKAY.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.050
WELL,
HE'S IN GOOD HANDS HERE.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.020
AND WE'RE GONNA FIND
THE GUYS WHO DID THIS.

05:20.053 --> 05:23.056
- KEN, ALEJANDRO'S
ASKING FOR YOU.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.695
- HOW BAD?
- OH, THEY BRUTALIZED HIM.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.763
SHATTERED ORBITAL BONE,
TORN RECTUM.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.132
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT
INTERNAL BLEEDING.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.667
- THE HATE CRIMES UNIT
IS ON ITS WAY.

05:33.701 --> 05:37.771
- WE'RE NOT GIVING THIS
TO HATE CRIMES.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.540
- I KNOW WE'VE SEEN
AN INCREASE OVERALL

05:39.573 --> 05:41.509
IN GAY BASHING,
BUT THERE'S THIS ONE INCIDENT

05:41.542 --> 05:42.743
FROM TWO WEEKS AGO.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.578
IT'S THE EXACT SAME M.O.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.079
BARRY FLACO,
HE'S IN THE BRONX.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.781
HE WAS JUMPED
OUTSIDE OF A GAY BAR.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.383
- THAT'S A LONG WAY
FROM CHELSEA.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.952
- IT IS...BUT THIS VICTIM,
HE WAS DOMINICAN.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.687
HE WAS PULLED INSIDE
OF A VAN.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.156
HE WAS TAKEN TO AN APARTMENT.
HE WAS BEATEN, SODOMIZED.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.659
- DOMINICANS AGAIN, HMM?
THE BRONX...

05:58.692 --> 06:02.095
COULD BE SOME SORT
OF GANG INITIATION RITE.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.964
- OKAY, YOU HAVE ANY
SKETCHES TO GO ON, ANY I.D.?

06:03.997 --> 06:06.567
- NO, THEY PUT A HOOD
ON HIM, TOO.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.437
FLACO TOLD HATE CRIMES
THAT HE DIDN'T REMEMBER A THING.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.938
- HE'S PROBABLY SCARED
TO DEATH.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.741
- LIV, YOU AND ROLLINS
GO RE-INTERVIEW FLACO.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.577
AMARO, GO TALK TO YOUR
OLD BUDDIES AT THE GANG UNIT.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.713
- I COULD CHECK
THE LOCAL PRECINCTS.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.149
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

06:22.182 --> 06:25.519
- FIN, THE CAPTAIN CALLED
FROM HIS CONFERENCE.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.888
HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
ANYWHERE NEAR THIS.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.457
- HE'S IN D.C.
HOW'S HE GONNA KNOW?

06:29.490 --> 06:30.991
- YOU CAN'T.
YOU'RE PERSONALLY INVOLVED.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.593
- DAMN RIGHT,
THAT'S MY SON.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.496
- EXACTLY,
SO GO BE WITH HIM.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.532
WE GOT THIS.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.604
- HEY, HOW'S ALEJANDRO?

06:43.637 --> 06:45.606
- DOCTOR
UPPED HIS MORPHINE.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.140
HE'S STILL OUT.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.909
ROLLINS SAYS
YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR ME.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.044
- YEAH THE OTHER VICTIM
SAW AN "X" TATTOO

06:51.078 --> 06:52.746
UNDER THE EYE
OF ONE OF HIS ATTACKERS.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.783
WE'RE LOOKING
AT A DOMINICAN GANG, BX9.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.451
- BX9?

06:57.485 --> 06:59.487
THE GANG NAMED THEMSELVES
AFTER A BUS ROUTE?

06:59.520 --> 07:00.854
- WELL, THAT'S THE THING,
YOU KNOW?

07:00.888 --> 07:03.156
ALL THE GOOD
GANG NAMES--ALREADY TAKEN.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.494
- [chuckles]
- HERE.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.895
- MUG SHOTS.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.062
THANK YOU, MAN.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.432
- HE I.D.s SOMEONE,
YOU CALL ME.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.868
- WHAT'S GOING ON, DAD?

07:14.902 --> 07:17.705
- ALEJANDRO SAID
THE ATTACKERS KNEW HIS NAME.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.973
HE EVER HANG OUT
WITH ANY GANG MEMBERS?

07:20.007 --> 07:22.976
- HE'S A STYLIST,
NOT EXACTLY GANG MATERIAL.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.679
- WHAT ABOUT HIS FAMILY?

07:30.618 --> 07:31.919
THANKS FOR COMING.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.186
- COME ON,
I OWE YA.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.588
- WHAT'D YOU TELL MUNCH?

07:34.622 --> 07:35.789
- I DIDN'T.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.158
ALEJANDRO'S COUSIN?
- MARISOL.

07:38.191 --> 07:42.195
KEN SAID HER BOYFRIEND, CESAR,
ROLLS WITH THE BX9.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.799
MARISOL PAVEL?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.501
- I DIDN'T CALL
THE POLICE.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.002
- HEY, HEY,
WHERE'S CESAR?

07:49.036 --> 07:51.672
- YOU HAVE A SEARCH WARRANT?
- YOU STAY RIGHT THERE.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.641
- ALL CLEAR.

07:53.674 --> 07:54.742
HE'S NOT HERE,

07:54.775 --> 07:56.209
BUT LOOK WHAT I FOUND
ON THE DRESSER.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.545
GOT A PERMIT FOR THIS?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.046
- NO.
YOU PUT THAT THERE.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.848
- SOMEBODY'S GOING TO JAIL.
IS THIS HIS OR YOURS?

08:00.881 --> 08:02.783
- I'VE SEEN TV.
I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.984
- CALL YOUR BOYFRIEND NOW.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.054
- HE'S AT WORK.
- TELL HIM YOU'RE IN LABOR.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.222
- YOU'RE NOT
IN THE GANG YET.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.124
RIGHT, CESAR?

08:11.158 --> 08:12.826
I MEAN,
YOU'D HAVE THEIR TAT,

08:12.860 --> 08:15.663
SO FOR THE INITIATION,
THEY MAKE YOU GIVE UP

08:15.696 --> 08:17.565
A QUEER BOY
IN YOUR FAMILY.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.033
- HE'S NOT MY FAMILY.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.973
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.108
THAT YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO DO THIS.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.644
THEY PROBABLY MADE YOU
USE THE BASEBALL BAT.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.580
- I DIDN'T DO NOTHING
WITH THE BAT.

08:32.613 --> 08:37.050
- WELL, BUT YOU WERE THERE,
RIGHT?

08:37.084 --> 08:40.621
TELL ME
WHO ELSE WAS THERE.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.627
- SO LAST NIGHT,
WHO DID CESAR GO OUT WITH?

08:46.660 --> 08:47.861
- I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.029
- YOU KEEP ACTING TOUGH,

08:49.062 --> 08:51.064
'CAUSE THAT GUN WE FOUND
IN YOUR APARTMENT,

08:51.098 --> 08:52.766
YOU CAN'T PLEA THAT DOWN.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.334
THAT'S MANDATORY
PRISON TIME.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.103
- SO YOU PICKED HER UP
BY YOURSELF?

08:56.136 --> 08:58.972
- MM-HMM.
- AND THE GUN?

08:59.006 --> 09:01.074
- IN PLAIN SIGHT
WHEN I ENTERED THE APARTMENT.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.843
[Benson talking in background]

09:02.876 --> 09:05.879
- WORK YOUR STORY
BEFORE WE CALL THE D.A.,

09:05.913 --> 09:08.015
OKAY?

09:08.048 --> 09:11.051
- I SWEAR I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT GUN.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.256
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:16.289 --> 09:18.859
I BELIEVE YOU.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.228
I'LL TELL MY SERGEANT
IT'S MARISOL'S.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.963
- WHAT? NO!

09:22.996 --> 09:24.732
- POSSESSION'S A FELONY,
MINIMUM ONE YEAR.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.900
MARISOL'S WHAT,
SEVEN, EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT?

09:26.934 --> 09:29.637
SHE'LL HAVE YOUR BABY
IN PRISON, ALONE.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.739
SHE'LL BLAME YOU.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.173
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU EITHER
BE A MAN NOW

09:33.206 --> 09:35.075
AND PROTECT YOUR FAMILY,

09:35.108 --> 09:36.844
OR I GO TELL HER
YOU SOLD HER OUT.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.780
HER AND YOUR BABY.
- NO, LISTEN.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.115
OKAY, I LIED ABOUT THE GUN.
IT'S MINE.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.884
- NO.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.385
TILL YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALEJANDRO,

09:45.418 --> 09:47.354
THE GUN'S HERS.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.328
- TO YOUR RIGHT.
OVER HERE.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.396
- LET'S GO.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.999
- HAVE A SEAT.
LET'S GO.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.334
GET IN THERE.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.236
ALEJANDRO I.D.ed 'EM ALL.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.205
- SO DID BARRY FLACO,
THE BRONX VICTIM.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.641
- AND C.S.U. IS WORKING
BOTH THE VAN AND THE APARTMENT?

10:07.675 --> 10:09.409
- AND CESAR WILL TESTIFY.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.646
- I'LL TELL MY SON.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.259
[muffled screaming]

10:29.429 --> 10:30.330
- SVU?

10:30.363 --> 10:32.099
IS THIS ABOUT
THOSE ATTACKS IN THE NEWS?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.033
I'M NOT GAY.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.836
- NO, WE JUST NEED TO ASK
WHAT HAPPENED.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.905
- I TOLD THE OTHER COPS.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.840
UM, I WAS WALKING
DOWN THE STREET

10:39.873 --> 10:42.676
AND BOOM, I GOT DRAGGED
INTO A VAN BY THREE GUYS.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.445
- DID THEY
SEXUALLY ASSAULT YOU?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.180
- OH, MY GOD, NO.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.683
I MEAN, THEY HIT ME
IN THE BALLS WITH A BAT,

10:49.717 --> 10:50.818
BUT NOTHING ELSE.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.352
- THEY CALL YOU
ANY NAMES?

10:52.385 --> 10:55.989
- YEAH, UM, FAG, HOMO--
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHY.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.091
I'M--I'M TELLING YOU,
I'M NOT GAY, ALL RIGHT?

10:58.125 --> 10:59.226
- ALL RIGHT.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.193
DID YOU GET A LOOK
AT THESE GUYS?

11:00.227 --> 11:04.331
- YEAH, UM, DARK HAIR,
PUERTO RICANS MAYBE.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.933
- WHAT ABOUT THE VAN?

11:05.966 --> 11:07.267
WHAT COLOR WAS IT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.736
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.770
IT SMELLED LIKE DIRT.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.972
- OKAY, MR. SIMMS,
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON

11:12.005 --> 11:13.807
THAT SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE
TO ATTACK YOU?

11:13.841 --> 11:15.776
- NO. MM-MM.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.345
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO--
I DON'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.880
ALL RIGHT, PLEASE?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.414
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.351
ALL RIGHT?

11:37.931 --> 11:41.268
- KEN, DID ALEJANDRO
HAVE ANY FAMILY HERE?

11:41.301 --> 11:43.136
- YES AND NO.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.939
HIS FATHER STOPPED SPEAKING
WITH HIM WHEN HE CAME OUT.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.379
- WE MIGHT NOT HAVE
GOT 'EM ALL.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.915
THERE WAS ANOTHER
ATTACK LAST NIGHT.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.787
- OUR LATEST VICTIM,
RICK SIMMS--

11:59.820 --> 12:01.421
IS BX9
TRYING TO TAUNT US?

12:01.454 --> 12:03.090
- WELL, THERE'S
SOME SIMILARITIES,

12:03.123 --> 12:04.958
BUT HE WAS PICKED UP
ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE,

12:04.992 --> 12:06.293
NOT EXACTLY BOYS TOWN.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.995
- SO HE WASN'T
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.496
AND WASN'T
TAKEN ANYWHERE?

12:09.529 --> 12:11.298
- YOU KNOW,
COULD BE UNRELATED.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.133
MAYBE IT'S SOMEBODY TRYING
TO MAKE A BEATING

12:13.166 --> 12:14.234
LOOK LIKE A GAY BASH.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.502
- WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT MR. SIMMS?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.304
- JUST WHAT HE TOLD US.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.806
YOU KNOW, HE'S
A HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHER.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.841
RECENTLY SEPARATED
FROM HIS LAWYER WIFE.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.109
- SEPARATED?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.011
WELL, IF THERE'S MUD,
SHE'LL THROW IT.

12:24.044 --> 12:27.114
GO BOND WITH MRS. SIMMS.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.049
- I'M SICK ABOUT THIS.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.185
RICK'S NOT GAY.
WE HAVE GAY FRIENDS.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.454
MAYBE THESE GUYS SAW RICK
WITH ONE OF THEM.

12:34.487 --> 12:37.958
- OKAY.
DID RICK MENTION

12:37.991 --> 12:39.927
THAT HE HAD
ANY PROBLEMS WITH ANYBODY?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.162
ENEMIES, MONEY TROUBLES?

12:42.195 --> 12:45.032
- RICK DOESN'T MAKE ENEMIES.
- WE MET HIM.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.266
HE SEEMS LIKE
THE KIND OF GUY

12:46.299 --> 12:48.168
WHO LETS PEOPLE
WALK ALL OVER HIM.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.070
IS THAT WHY
YOU TWO SEPARATED?

12:50.103 --> 12:51.839
- THAT,
I COULD LIVE WITH.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.307
RICK COULDN'T COMMIT
TO A CAREER.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.177
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
HE WAS ON WALL STREET.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.047
THEN THREE YEARS AGO,
HE SAID HE NO JOY IN HIS LIFE,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.548
WANTED TO BECOME A TEACHER.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.051
- THAT'S QUITE A STEP DOWN
IN INCOME.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.853
SO NOW HE TELLS US
HE TEACHES MATH

13:05.886 --> 13:07.120
AT MILLICENT FAWCETT.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.956
- NOT ANYMORE.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.557
THREE WEEKS AGO,
OUT OF THE BLUE,

13:10.590 --> 13:13.126
HE COMES HOME,
TELLS ME HE QUIT.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.828
- HE SAY WHY?

13:14.862 --> 13:17.831
- JUST NEEDED
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.500
- THANK YOU.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.169
YOU GET THE FEELING
THAT RICK'S LEAVING

13:22.202 --> 13:25.372
HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH FINDING HIS JOY?

13:27.908 --> 13:30.844
- RICK SIMMS, WELL,
HE WAS A VERY GOOD TEACHER.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.046
- CAN YOU TELL US
WHY HE SUDDENLY QUIT

13:33.080 --> 13:34.948
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE SEMESTER?

13:34.982 --> 13:36.483
- IS THAT
WHAT HE TOLD YOU?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.351
- OH, I'M--I'M SORRY.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.087
- NO, NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT,
JOANNE.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.856
THE DETECTIVES ARE ASKING
ABOUT RICK SIMMS.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.993
MS. JOANNE PARSONS,
THE HEAD OF OUR UPPER SCHOOL.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.495
- SO YOU WERE
RICK'S SUPERVISOR?

13:48.528 --> 13:51.098
- WELL, YES.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.100
- CAN YOU TELL US
WHY HE LEFT THE SCHOOL?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.634
- MAY I ASK
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

13:54.667 --> 13:57.871
- RICK SIMMS WAS THE VICTIM
OF A VICIOUS ASSAULT LAST NIGHT.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.272
- OH, DEAR!

13:59.306 --> 14:02.009
- AND WE'RE INVESTIGATING
WHAT MOTIVATED THE ATTACK,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.544
IF HE HAVING ANY TROUBLE
HERE AT WORK.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.379
- I'M SORRY,
BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES

14:06.413 --> 14:09.182
OF MR. SIMMS LEAVING
ARE CONFIDENTIAL.

14:09.216 --> 14:13.253
- NOT IF THEY INVOLVE, SAY,
AN ALLEGATION OF CHILD ABUSE.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.888
- I'M AFRAID
I HAVE TO CUT THIS SHORT.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.024
I'LL NEED TO TALK
TO OUR COUNSEL.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.560
- WELL,
THAT WAS A STONE WALL.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.963
AND SHE WANTED TO TALK.
YOU SEE THAT LOOK IN HER EYE?

14:22.996 --> 14:23.830
- OH, YEAH.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.498
- WE HAVE TO GET
A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.935
- NOW WHO'S MILLICENT FAWCETT
ANYWAY?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.570
- UH, SHE'S
A BRITISH SUFFRAGETTE.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.572
I LOOKED IT UP.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.442
- IS RICK
IN ANY OF THESE?

14:35.475 --> 14:36.944
- HERE WE GO.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.046
THERE HE IS WITH JOANNE.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.148
FACULTY BENEFIT COMMITTEE.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.183
- THIRD WHEEL
LOOKS FRIENDLY.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.252
WELL,
SCHOOL'S ALMOST OUT.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.355
SHE'LL BE HARD TO MISS.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.923
- RICK DIDN'T TELL ANYONE
WHY HE LEFT.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.458
WAIT,
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

14:51.491 --> 14:54.061
- UH,
IT'S A POLICE INVESTIGATION.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.296
- OH, SO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:56.329 --> 15:00.100
- WE HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.603
- RICK IS LUCKY
THAT THEY LET HIM LEAVE QUIETLY.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.406
COME ON, I CAN'T SAY ANYMORE.
I COULD LOSE MY JOB.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.108
- WELL, YOU DO KNOW
FAILURE TO REPORT

15:08.141 --> 15:10.410
AN ALLEGATION OF ABUSE
IS A CRIME?

15:10.443 --> 15:12.579
- YOU COULD LOSE
YOUR TEACHING LICENSE.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.248
- THE SECOND I THOUGHT
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON,

15:15.282 --> 15:16.716
I WENT
TO THE ADMINISTRATION,

15:16.749 --> 15:19.953
AND THEY TOLD ME
THEY WOULD HANDLE IT.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.324
- I LOVE
BEING A TEACHER.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.493
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
TO ANY OF MY STUDENTS.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.963
- WE KNOW ONE OF YOUR
FELLOW TEACHERS REPORTED YOU,

15:29.997 --> 15:33.333
SO...WHAT DIDN'T YOU DO,
RICK?

15:33.366 --> 15:35.635
- NOTHING. NOTHING.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.438
ALL RIGHT,
THREE WEEKS AGO,

15:38.471 --> 15:40.240
JOANNE,
THE HEAD OF UPPER SCHOOL,

15:40.273 --> 15:42.509
CALLED ME
INTO THE HEADMASTER'S OFFICE.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.111
AND THEY SAID
THAT A STUDENT

15:44.144 --> 15:46.346
HAD MADE AN ACCUSATION
AGAINST ME.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.648
- AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO IT WAS

15:48.681 --> 15:50.984
OR WHAT THEY WERE
ACCUSING YOU OF?

15:51.018 --> 15:52.652
- NONE.
THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.056
AND IN THIS SYSTEM,
TO BE ACCUSED IS TO BE GUILTY.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.259
- WAIT, SO YOU JUST
DECIDED TO RESIGN?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.128
- YEAH,
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.529
I LEFT A JOB
THAT I LOVED,

16:02.562 --> 16:05.332
MY WIFE LEFT ME,
AND I GOT BEAT UP.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.234
- IF I HAD TO GUESS,
A PARENT FOUND OUT

16:07.267 --> 16:09.002
THAT HE MOLESTED THEIR KID,
BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HIM,

16:09.036 --> 16:10.270
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
A GAY BASH.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.105
- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF RICK DID ANYTHING.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.406
HE'S ACCUSED ANONYMOUSLY.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.674
I--I DON'T MAKE HIM
AS A PREDATOR.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.010
- THE BEST PREDATORS
BLEND IN.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.146
I MEAN, EVEN
TWO OF HIS FELLOW TEACHERS,

16:19.179 --> 16:20.713
NATALIE RELAIS
AND JOANNA PARSONS,

16:20.747 --> 16:22.349
THINK HE'S GUILTY.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.285
- CABOT IS WORKING ON
A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.554
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
I ACCESSED

16:27.587 --> 16:29.756
THE SCHOOL'S ONLINE
PARENT DIRECTORY.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.791
THEY'RE LAWYERS,
HEDGE FUND GUYS.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.760
- COME ON,
IF SIMMS DID ABUSE SOMEONE,

16:33.793 --> 16:35.428
HE'S NOT GONNA PICK
A RICH KID.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.597
- AND A WEALTHY FAMILY
IS NOT GONNA LET THE SCHOOL

16:37.630 --> 16:40.700
SWEEP IT UNDER THE RUG,
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

16:40.733 --> 16:42.302
SOMEONE
LESS SOPHISTICATED.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.638
UH, BLUE COLLAR,
BRIDGE AND TUNNEL, SCHOLARSHIP?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.240
- THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL
OF FAMILIES

16:47.274 --> 16:49.142
THAT AREN'T
UPPER EAST SIDE.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.044
START WITH THEM.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.180
- SO SOMEONE FROM THAT SCHOOL
LIVES IN THE BRONX?

16:53.213 --> 16:55.315
- UH, NEW JERSEY.
THE KID'S FATHER

16:55.348 --> 16:58.051
RUNS A PRODUCE DISTRIBUTORSHIP
OUT OF HUNTS POINT.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.353
- OKAY.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.222
- AND HOW'S ALEJANDRO
AND YOUR SON DOING?

17:02.255 --> 17:05.325
- ALEJANDRO'S
STILL NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.094
MY SON--
HE'S HOLDING IT TOGETHER.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.628
- AND YOU?

17:08.661 --> 17:10.763
- I'M JUST HAPPY
TO BE WORKING.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.402
A LOT OF VANS.
- MM-HMM.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.536
RICK SIMMS SAID
HIS SMELLED LIKE DIRT.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.338
THESE DEFINITELY WOULD.
HEY,

17:18.371 --> 17:20.807
YOU KNOW
WHERE RAY GABARDELLI IS?

17:22.409 --> 17:25.478
MR. GABARDELLI?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.414
YOU GOT A SON
AT MILLICENT FAWCETT?

17:27.447 --> 17:29.616
- YEAH, WHY?
WHAT, DID LUCA DO SOMETHING?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.118
- I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A YES.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.553
CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE YOU WERE TWO NIGHTS AGO?

17:33.586 --> 17:36.223
- LEAGUE BOWLING.
LISTEN, I'M VERY BUSY HERE.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.091
I'M SORRY.
- LOOK, WE COULD GET

17:38.125 --> 17:40.127
A SEARCH WARRANT AND JUST
SHUT DOWN YOUR WHOLE BUSINESS,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.262
OR YOU COULD TELL US
WHICH VAN IT WAS.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.364
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.634
- JUST TELL US.
AFTER WHAT HE DID TO LUCA,

17:47.667 --> 17:49.469
RICK SIMMS
AIN'T GONNA PRESS CHARGES.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.639
- I DON'T CARE.
I'D DO IT AGAIN.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.675
SICK BASTARD MOLESTED MY KID.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.578
- THE SCHOOL TELL YOU
NOT TO COME TO THE POLICE?

17:58.611 --> 18:01.114
- NO. THAT WAS ME.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.150
BAD ENOUGH
MY SON HAS TO TELL ME.

18:03.183 --> 18:06.085
I DON'T WANT HIM
HUMILIATED IN PUBLIC.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.589
- DOES MY MOM
HAVE TO BE HERE?

18:09.622 --> 18:12.292
- WELL, THAT'S UP TO HER.

18:12.325 --> 18:16.363
MRS. GABARDELLI?

18:16.396 --> 18:19.166
- I'LL BE
RIGHT IN THE LIVING ROOM.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.237
- LOOK, I-I'M OVER IT.
HE'S OUT OF MY SCHOOL.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.474
- WELL, WE THINK YOUR FATHER
WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU,

18:27.507 --> 18:30.410
BUT HE'S LOOKING AT ASSAULT
AND ATTEMPTED MURDER.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.280
- HE'S GONNA GO TO GO TO JAIL?

18:33.313 --> 18:36.349
BUT THAT'S NOT RIGHT--
- WELL, THEN HELP HIM.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.752
NOW, IF YOU CAN TELL US
WHY HE WENT AFTER MR. SIMMS,

18:39.786 --> 18:42.855
THAT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE
WITH THE D.A.

18:44.724 --> 18:48.461
- A MONTH AGO, MR. SIMMS
ASKED ME TO STAY AFTER CLASS,

18:48.495 --> 18:51.231
ABOUT MY GRADES.

18:51.264 --> 18:55.368
- SO WHAT DID HE SAY?

18:55.402 --> 18:57.437
- THAT I WASN'T
CUTTING IT.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.175
HE SAID HE KNEW IT HAD TO BE
HARD FOR ME AT SCHOOL,

19:02.209 --> 19:03.410
COMING FROM JERSEY,

19:03.443 --> 19:07.380
WITH ALL THOSE
UPPER EAST SIDE BRATS.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.349
- IT'S OKAY, LUCA.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.320
GO ON.

19:15.288 --> 19:19.926
- HE SAID
HE'D LOOK OUT FOR ME...

19:19.959 --> 19:22.329
IF I LOOKED OUT
FOR HIM.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.734
- WHAT DID HE MEAN
"LOOK OUT FOR HIM"?

19:30.370 --> 19:32.572
- HEY, RICK.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.474
- HEY, DETECTIVES.
CAN I HELP YOU?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.709
- YEAH, GOOD NEWS, WE FOUND
THE GUY WHO BEAT YOU UP.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.445
- BUT THE BAD NEWS IS,

19:38.478 --> 19:40.480
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A MINOR.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.782
- COME ON.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.820
- LUCA GABARDELLI
SAID I MOLESTED HIM?

19:47.854 --> 19:49.256
ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.492
- RICK, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT LUCA?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.861
- HE'S IN MY GEOMETRY CLASS.
HE'S AN AVERAGE STUDENT.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.264
HE'S--HE'S A BIT
OF AN OUTSIDER.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.598
- DID YOU EVER
TALK TO HIM ABOUT THAT?

19:58.631 --> 20:00.333
- YEAH, A FEW T--
WAIT, WAIT,

20:00.367 --> 20:01.634
WHAT EXACTLY DID HE SAY
THAT I DID?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.803
- THAT YOU ASKED HIM
TO PERFORM A SEXUAL ACT.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.539
- OH, MY GOD, WHEN WAS I
SUPPOSED TO HAVE DONE THAT?

20:06.573 --> 20:08.308
- DID YOU EVER HAVE LUCA
STAY AFTER CLASS?

20:08.341 --> 20:10.643
- ONCE. YEAH,
AFTER HOLIDAY BREAK.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.412
- OKAY, SO YOU HAVE BEEN
ALONE WITH HIM.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.447
- EASY, I WAS TRYING
TO HELP THE KID OUT HERE.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.249
- YOU MEAN TRYING
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

20:16.283 --> 20:17.584
OF A VULNERABLE STUDENT.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.453
YOU JUST SAID SO YOURSELF
THAT HE'S AN OUTSIDER.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.821
THAT WOULD MAKE HIM
EASY PREY, RIGHT?

20:21.854 --> 20:22.955
- THIS IS INSANE.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.824
HE WAS FALLING ASLEEP
IN MY CLASS.

20:24.857 --> 20:25.892
I ASKED HIM
IF HE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS,

20:25.925 --> 20:27.059
AND HE JUST SHUT DOWN.
THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENED.

20:27.093 --> 20:31.464
- WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER
YOU EXPOSED YOURSELF TO HIM?

20:31.498 --> 20:34.667
YOU SEE, IN MY EXPERIENCE,
BOYS THIS AGE,

20:34.701 --> 20:37.404
THE STIGMA
OF HOMOSEXUALITY...

20:37.437 --> 20:40.440
DON'T USUALLY
MAKE THINGS LIKE THIS UP.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.878
- LOOK, RICK,
IS IT POSSIBLE

20:45.912 --> 20:47.079
HE MISINTERPRETED
SOMETHING YOU SAID OR DID?

20:47.113 --> 20:50.550
- MMM. NO. NO, NO, NO, IT'S NOT.
NO, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY,

20:50.583 --> 20:54.020
'CAUSE I'M NOT GAY,
AND I'M NOT A PEDOPHILE.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.389
- OKAY.
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON

20:56.423 --> 20:57.223
LUCA WOULD HAVE
TO GET BACK AT YOU?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.459
BAD GRADES,
CALLING HIS PARENTS--

20:59.492 --> 21:00.927
- YEAH, I-I TOLD HIM
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIS GRADES,

21:00.960 --> 21:02.362
THAT'S IT.
AND THAT--THAT DOESN'T MEAN--

21:02.395 --> 21:03.696
- DOESN'T MAKE SENSE?
both: NO.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.698
- IT DOESN'T.
- NONE OF IT DOES.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.500
NONE OF IT.

21:07.534 --> 21:11.671
- MR. SIMMS,
YOUR WIFE SENT AN ATTORNEY.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.373
- OH, MY GOD.
- SAID YOU CAN WORK OUT

21:13.406 --> 21:16.476
THE LEGAL FEES
DURING THE DIVORCE SETTLEMENT.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.511
- OH, MY GOD.

21:18.545 --> 21:19.779
- NO RECORD,
NO PRIOR COMPLAINTS?

21:19.812 --> 21:21.781
- WELL, HE DID JUST BECOME
A TEACHER THIS YEAR.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.317
- WELL, TO ME,
HE SEEMS GENUINELY BLINDSIDED.

21:24.351 --> 21:27.387
- AND I'VE SEEN THAT AFFECT
ON PEDOPHILES A HUNDRED TIMES.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.788
- HOW CREDIBLE
IS LUCA'S STORY?

21:28.821 --> 21:30.390
- WELL, HE WAS AWKWARD,
UNCOMFORTABLE,

21:30.423 --> 21:31.358
HIS GRADES
HAVE BEEN SLIPPING.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.792
I MEAN, SOMETHING'S
GOING ON WITH THIS KID.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.494
- WELL, THEN WE SHOULD
GO BACK TO THE FAMILY,

21:34.527 --> 21:36.729
SEE WHEN THEY NOTICED
CHANGES IN HIS BEHAVIOR.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.831
- BEFORE YOU DO THAT,
GO BACK TO THE SCHOOL.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.501
WHO DID LUCA OUTCRY TO,
WHEN, WHY?

21:41.534 --> 21:43.102
VET THE DETAILS.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.405
- I CAN ASSURE YOU,
I WAS JUST TRYING TO PROTECT

21:45.438 --> 21:47.440
THE PRIVACY OF A STUDENT.
- REALLY?

21:47.474 --> 21:50.510
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU TRIED
TO BURY A POSSIBLE ASSAULT

21:50.543 --> 21:51.878
TO PROTECT YOUR REPUTATION.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.913
- LUCA GABARDELLI'S FAMILY
WAS ADAMANT

21:53.946 --> 21:55.482
ABOUT NOT MAKING THIS PUBLIC.
- KNOW WHAT?

21:55.515 --> 21:57.884
THAT'S NOT
THEIR CHOICE NOW, OR YOURS.

21:57.917 --> 22:02.088
SO WHO DID LUCA
DISCLOSE TO FIRST?

22:02.121 --> 22:04.991
- YES,
LUCA TOLD ME ABOUT RICK SIMMS.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.827
MR. OVERBY SAID I COULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING, FOR LUCA'S SAKE.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.697
- WELL, NOW YOU CAN,
AND THIS TIME

22:10.730 --> 22:14.033
IT REALLY IS
FOR LUCA'S SAKE.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.968
- [sighs]

22:16.002 --> 22:18.571
THREE WEEKS AGO,
I WAS GIVING A LECTURE

22:18.605 --> 22:24.844
ON HUMAN SEXUALITY,
AND LUCA'S FACE WAS RED.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.747
AND I-I COULD SEE TEARS
IN HIS EYES.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.518
- GO ON.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.152
- THE NEXT DAY
I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT,

22:33.185 --> 22:35.922
AND AT FIRST,
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.124
BUT THEN HE CONFESSED
THAT AFTER WINTER BREAK

22:38.157 --> 22:40.993
MR. SIMMS
HAD UNZIPPED HIS PANTS

22:41.027 --> 22:43.396
AND PROPOSITIONED HIM.

22:43.430 --> 22:46.733
- NOW, WHAT EXACTLY
DID HE DESCRIBE?

22:46.766 --> 22:52.839
- THAT MR. SIMMS ASKED LUCA
TO PUT HIS HAND...

22:52.872 --> 22:54.807
ON HIS PENIS.

22:54.841 --> 23:00.079
WHEN LUCA SAID NO,
HE STARTED TOUCHING HIMSELF.

23:00.112 --> 23:03.616
I WAS SHOCKED, OBVIOUSLY.

23:03.650 --> 23:07.554
- AND YOU BELIEVED LUCA?
- YES, OF COURSE.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.556
- SO ONCE YOU HEARD
THE ACCUSATION,

23:09.589 --> 23:11.624
WHAT DID YOU DO?

23:11.658 --> 23:13.793
- THE FIRST
I HEARD OF THIS WAS,

23:13.826 --> 23:19.065
UH, IN MR. OVERBY'S OFFICE
WITH NATALIE AND LUCA.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.501
- WHAT EXACTLY
DID LUCA SAY?

23:21.534 --> 23:27.640
- HE--[sighs] HE SAID THAT
MR. SIMMS HAD EXPOSED HIMSELF,

23:27.674 --> 23:30.677
PUT HIS HAND
ON HIS GENITALS.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.883
- HIS OWN HAND,
OR LUCA'S HAND?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.686
- [clears throat]
LUCA'S HAND.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.888
I'M S--[coughs] I'M SORRY,
THIS IS ALL--

23:41.921 --> 23:43.756
IT'S ALL SO DISTURBING.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.725
- UH, DID YOU TALK
TO RICK SIMMS?

23:45.758 --> 23:49.996
- UH, NO. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
AGAINST SCHOOL PROTOCOL.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.765
- DID YOU EVER THINK
THERE WAS A CHANCE

23:52.799 --> 23:56.102
THAT LUCA
WAS MAKING IT UP?

23:56.135 --> 24:00.840
- NO. I--I HAD BEEN CONCERNED
ABOUT LUCA ALL SEMESTER.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.074
HE WAS CLEARLY STRUGGLING.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.677
I'D HAD SEVERAL CONFERENCES
WITH HIM.

24:04.711 --> 24:07.113
- DID YOU EVER HAVE
ANY SUSPICIONS ABOUT MR. SIMMS,

24:07.146 --> 24:09.015
ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR?

24:09.048 --> 24:14.587
- NO. IN HINDSIGHT,
IT DID MAKE ME WONDER WHY

24:14.621 --> 24:17.590
HE SUDDENLY DECIDED
TO BECOME A TEACHER.

24:19.692 --> 24:20.960
- GIVE THE PEDOPHILE
A SEVERANCE,

24:20.993 --> 24:22.194
SEND HIM ON HIS WAY,

24:22.228 --> 24:23.630
AND THE SCHOOL'S RECORD
REMAINS SPOTLESS.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.197
- BUT LIV,
THE STORY LUCA TOLD US

24:25.231 --> 24:27.099
IS DIFFERENT FROM
THE ONE HE TOLD THE TEACHERS,

24:27.133 --> 24:29.201
AND THEY DON'T EVEN AGREE
ON WHO TOUCHED WHAT WHEN.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.538
- WE BOTH KNOW THAT SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO LUCA.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.840
- MAYBE. BUT BEFORE
THEY PROSECUTE SIMMS,

24:33.873 --> 24:36.809
WE NEED TO BE
ABSOLUTELY SURE WHAT.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.578
- MR. SIMMS MADE ME STAY
AFTER CLASS,

24:38.611 --> 24:40.847
AND THEN HE...
PULLED IT OUT,

24:40.880 --> 24:42.849
AND HE SAID
HE WANTED ME TO TOUCH IT, AND--

24:42.882 --> 24:45.552
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
KEEP SAYING THE SAME THING?

24:45.585 --> 24:48.054
- OKAY, LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND
THIS IS DIFFICULT,

24:48.087 --> 24:51.858
BUT WE NEED TO BE SURE
OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.627
- STOP CALLING MY SON A LIAR.
HE IS TRAUMATIZED BY THIS.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.729
- MRS. GABARDELLI,
THERE ARE SOME INCONSISTENCIES

24:56.763 --> 24:58.631
WE NEED TO CLEAR UP.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.132
- JUST ASK YOUR QUESTIONS.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.002
- OKAY. LUCA...

25:03.035 --> 25:06.606
SO MR. SIMMS
PULLED OUT HIS PENIS?

25:06.639 --> 25:08.575
- YES.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.744
- DID HE DROP HIS PANTS
OR JUST THROUGH THE ZIPPER?

25:11.778 --> 25:13.746
- HE DROPPED HIS PANTS.

25:13.780 --> 25:17.717
- OKAY,
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

25:17.750 --> 25:19.619
- HE--UH, I--HE--

25:19.652 --> 25:21.888
A--HE ASKED ME TO TOUCH IT,
BUT THEN I DIDN'T,

25:21.921 --> 25:24.156
SO THEN
HE TOUCHED HIMSELF.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.792
- OKAY.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.595
NOW, WAS HE ERECT?

25:28.628 --> 25:30.963
- UM, I GUESS.
- YOU GUESS?

25:30.997 --> 25:34.133
OKAY. CAN YOU DESCRIBE
HIS PENIS?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.635
- I DON'T...KNOW--
- IS HE CIRCUMCISED,

25:35.668 --> 25:37.637
UNCIRCUMCISED?
- W--

25:37.670 --> 25:38.771
- CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION,
LUCA?

25:38.805 --> 25:40.172
- NO, I DON'T REMEMBER.
- DID YOU SEE HIS PENIS AT ALL?

25:40.206 --> 25:41.741
- NO, I MEAN, YES.
M-MOM, I--

25:41.774 --> 25:43.075
- YOU'RE CONFUSING HIM.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.711
- NICK.
- SON, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

25:44.744 --> 25:46.112
GO IN FRONT OF
THE GRAND JURY, RIGHT?

25:46.145 --> 25:47.814
YOU NEED
TO GET YOUR DETAILS STRAIGHT.

25:47.847 --> 25:48.881
- I HAVE TO TESTIFY?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.116
- LOOK, MAYBE WE SHOULD
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK, OKAY?

25:50.149 --> 25:51.183
- I DON'T NEED A BREAK, OKAY?
I'M DONE. MOM, HEY, PLEASE--

25:51.217 --> 25:53.720
- DETECTIVES, YOU NEED TO LEAVE.
- LUCA, IF YOU'RE

25:53.753 --> 25:55.021
NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,
WE CAN'T BE SURE ABOUT IT.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.355
- THAT IS ENOUGH.
- NICK.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.724
- YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.759
- OKAY.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.667
- YOU WENT AT HIM
PRETTY HARD.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.636
- YEAH, YOU WENT PRETTY EASY.
YOU DO KNOW HE'S LYING?

26:09.669 --> 26:12.672
- I DO.
I'M JUST NOT SURE WHY.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.710
- HOW'S THINGS AT THE HOSPITAL?

26:17.744 --> 26:19.245
- ALEJANDRO
HAS INTERNAL BLEEDING.

26:19.278 --> 26:22.214
THEY MAY HAVE TO OPERATE.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.350
- GOOD LORD, FIN, I AM...
I'M SORRY.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.918
- MY SON'S HAD IT SO ROUGH,

26:25.952 --> 26:29.188
I MEAN, BEING BLACK,
BEING GAY...

26:29.221 --> 26:30.857
- YOU EVER HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH KEN BEING GAY?

26:30.890 --> 26:33.993
- NAH.
- NEVER?

26:36.929 --> 26:39.932
- OKAY, I HAD TO ADDRESS IT.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.934
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT?

26:41.968 --> 26:44.236
COME ON, YOU KNOW
THE STUFF WE SEE ON THE JOB.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.205
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN WORRIED

26:46.238 --> 26:49.642
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HAPPENING TO KEN.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.015
- SO LUCA'S DAD
HAD RICK SIMMS BEAT UP

26:56.048 --> 26:57.216
FOR A CRIME
HE DIDN'T COMMIT?

26:57.249 --> 26:59.418
- WELL, WAS HESITANT
ON BASIC QUESTIONS.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.087
- HESITANT?

27:01.120 --> 27:03.289
WE'VE HAD VICTIMS BRUTALIZED
WHO REMEMBER MORE THAN HE DOES.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.692
- AND NOW THAT
HIS FATHER'S GONE VIGILANTE,

27:05.725 --> 27:07.226
HE'S AFRAID TO RECANT.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.929
- MAYBE HE'S AFRAID
OF TELLING THE TRUTH.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.331
LOOK, LUCA SAID THAT
THE INCIDENT WITH SIMMS

27:12.364 --> 27:14.400
HAPPENED A MONTH AGO,

27:14.433 --> 27:17.403
BUT HIS GRADES STARTED TO FALL
RIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.338
SO IF SOMETHING
DID HAPPEN TO LUCA,

27:19.371 --> 27:22.341
IT'S BEEN GOING ON
A LOT LONGER THAN HE SAID.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.981
- I'M REALLY SORRY
I LIED BEFORE.

27:29.015 --> 27:31.183
[sighs]
I COULDN'T TELL THE TRUTH,

27:31.217 --> 27:33.385
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO GET
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.855
- OKAY, LUCA. WELL, WHO WOULD
KICK YOU OUT OF SCHOOL?

27:35.888 --> 27:36.856
- MS. PARSONS.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.324
- JOANNE PARSONS?
HEAD OF THE UPPER SCHOOL.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.760
- YEAH.

27:40.793 --> 27:43.029
I COULDN'T SAY
IT WAS HER BEFORE.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.765
I MEAN, SHE'D EXPEL ME.

27:45.798 --> 27:49.235
- SO YOU BLAMED
MR. SIMMS?

27:49.268 --> 27:50.436
- LOOK, I-I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I JUST--

27:50.469 --> 27:53.272
I-I BLURTED HIS NAME OUT,
AND THEN EVERYONE KEPT ASKING ME

27:53.305 --> 27:56.308
TO REPEAT MY STORY.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.079
- OKAY.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.884
OKAY, LUCA.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.358
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

28:12.391 --> 28:15.762
- MS. PARSONS,
SHE, UM...

28:18.898 --> 28:20.967
SHE MADE ME
HAVE SEX WITH HER.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.370
- MS. PARSONS?
YOU'RE SURE?

28:24.403 --> 28:26.072
AND WHERE WAS THIS?

28:26.105 --> 28:27.239
- IN HER OFFICE,

28:27.273 --> 28:29.408
AND THEN,
ONCE WE WENT TO HER HOUSE.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.977
- SO YOU'VE BEEN
TO HER HOUSE?

28:31.010 --> 28:32.444
- IN BROOKLYN.

28:32.478 --> 28:35.114
BUT YOU--YOU CAN'T TELL HER
I SAID ANYTHING.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.348
SHE MADE ME SWEAR
NOT TO SAY ANY--

28:36.382 --> 28:40.252
- LUCA, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT,
OKAY?

28:40.286 --> 28:43.255
CAN YOU DESCRIBE
HER HOME?

28:43.289 --> 28:45.257
- YEAH, UH, IT'S OLD.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.359
SHE SAID IT WAS
HER GREAT AUNT'S HOUSE,

28:47.393 --> 28:51.764
AND SHE HAS A FOUR-POSTER BED,
EMBROIDERED PILLOWS,

28:51.798 --> 28:53.532
AND SHE READ ME POEMS
FROM A BOOK ON HER NIGHTSTAND

28:53.565 --> 28:57.403
CALLED, UH, THE PEARL
OR SOMETHING.

28:57.436 --> 29:00.339
- YOU SAW HER NAKED?

29:00.372 --> 29:02.041
- UH, IT WOULD HELP
IF YOU COULD REMEMBER

29:02.074 --> 29:06.212
ANY DETAILS
ABOUT HER BODY.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.015
- SHE HAS A BIRTHMARK
ON HER INNER THIGH

29:09.048 --> 29:10.449
SHAPED LIKE
A QUESTION MARK.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.951
- CAN I TAKE MY SON
HOME NOW?

29:11.984 --> 29:15.121
- YEAH, WAIT, JUST...
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.959
- FIRST THE KID
FALSELY ACCUSES ONE TEACHER,

29:19.992 --> 29:20.960
NOW HE ACCUSES ANOTHER?

29:20.993 --> 29:23.195
- YEAH, BUT THIS TIME
HE HAS A LOT OF DETAIL.

29:23.229 --> 29:26.032
- AND JOANNE SAID
THAT LUCA HAD BEEN IN HER OFFICE

29:26.065 --> 29:27.166
SEVERAL TIMES
THIS SEMESTER.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.434
- IT'S EASY TO VERIFY,
COUNSELOR,

29:28.467 --> 29:31.470
IF YOU'LL GET US
A SEARCH WARRANT.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.942
- PLEASE,
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.309
- MA'AM,
YOU NEED TO LET US INSIDE.

29:37.343 --> 29:38.911
- EXCUSE ME.
- PLEASE, TELL ME

29:38.945 --> 29:40.312
WHAT'S GOING ON.
- HEY, WHERE'S YOUR BEDROOM?

29:40.346 --> 29:41.547
- IT'S UPSTAIRS,
BUT WHY...

29:41.580 --> 29:45.217
WHY DO YOU NEED TO SEE
MY...BEDROOM?

29:48.087 --> 29:51.223
- FOUR-POSTER BED.
EMBROIDERED PILLOWS.

29:54.493 --> 29:57.296
- UH, EXCUSE ME.
UH--

29:57.329 --> 30:00.199
- THE PEARL: A VICTORIAN JOURNAL
OF EROTICA, JUST LIKE HE SAID.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.334
- NO, PLEASE, I-I'M SORRY,
THAT'S PRIVATE.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.270
- GUYS, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO BAG ALL THE SHEETS.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.406
- OH, MY GOD.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.042
- CAN YOU MOVE YOUR THIGH
OUTWARD, PLEASE?

30:10.076 --> 30:12.111
AND RAISE YOUR SKIRT
A BIT?

30:17.316 --> 30:20.319
- HAVE A SEAT.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.090
- SO TALK TO US
ABOUT LUCA.

30:24.123 --> 30:27.259
- I-I TOLD YOU,
HE'S A STUDENT

30:27.293 --> 30:30.262
IN MY 19th CENTURY
ENGLISH LITERATURE CLASS.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.597
- HAS HE EVER
BEEN TO YOUR HOME?

30:31.630 --> 30:34.366
- NO, NEVER.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.503
WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME THAT?

30:37.536 --> 30:40.239
DID--DID LUCA
TELL YOU THAT?

30:40.272 --> 30:42.074
HE'S--HE'S LYING.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.976
- WELL,
HE DESCRIBED YOUR BED,

30:44.010 --> 30:48.380
AND YOUR PILLOW,
AND YOUR BOOK OF POETRY.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.282
CAN YOU TELL ME
HOW HE WOULD KNOW THOSE DETAILS?

30:50.316 --> 30:52.351
- WELL, I-I DON'T KNOW.
I-I-I C--

30:52.384 --> 30:54.553
- WELL, JOANNE, HE ALSO
KNEW ABOUT THE BIRTHMARK

30:54.586 --> 30:57.523
ON YOUR INNER THIGH.
HOW WOULD HE KNOW THAT?

30:57.556 --> 30:59.625
- I DON'T KNOW, I--
[sighs]

30:59.658 --> 31:01.660
WELL,
I-I-I DON'T FEEL WELL.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.462
- ALL RIGHT, JOANNE,
JUST TAKE A BREATH.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.197
ALL RIGHT? PUT YOUR HEAD
BETWEEN YOUR KNEES,

31:05.231 --> 31:06.966
- I--OH!
- JUST RELAX.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.367
- [gasps] WHOA!

31:08.400 --> 31:09.902
- HEY.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.038
HEY,
CALL AN AMBULANCE!

31:15.374 --> 31:18.010
- JOANNE PARSONS
IS RESTING AT HOME.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.578
HER AUNT POSTED BAIL.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.180
- WELL,
SO SHE'S LAWYERED UP.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.648
WE'RE NOT GETTING
ANYTHING MORE OUT OF HER.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.016
- WELL, DO WE NEED TO?

31:24.050 --> 31:26.385
I MEAN, HE KNEW HER ROOM,
HER BIRTHMARK.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.320
- LUCA'S ALREADY
LIED TO US ONCE,

31:28.354 --> 31:30.923
SO I WANT SOMETHING
OTHER THAN JUST HIS TESTIMONY.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.124
WHAT ELSE
DO WE KNOW ABOUT HER?

31:32.158 --> 31:34.260
- NO RECORD,
NO PRIOR COMPLAINTS.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.595
- SHE SWITCHED SCHOOLS
THREE YEARS AGO,

31:36.628 --> 31:38.597
FROM, UH,
LINDEN FORREST ACADEMY.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.400
- WE KNOW SCHOOLS LIKE THESE
DON'T LIKE SCANDALS.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.435
- LET'S FIND OUT
WHY SHE LEFT.

31:45.437 --> 31:49.075
- WE GAVE JOANNE PARSONS
A GLOWING RECOMMENDATION.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.243
- WHOSE DECISION WAS IT
FOR HER TO LEAVE?

31:51.277 --> 31:52.411
- WELL,
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL,

31:52.444 --> 31:54.413
AS PART OF
HER SEPARATION AGREEMENT.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.448
- SO IT WAS YOURS?

31:56.482 --> 31:57.683
'CAUSE WE CAN SUBPOENA
THAT AGREEMENT,

31:57.716 --> 32:00.552
AND IF WE FIND OUT THAT YOU
COVERED UP ANY IMPROPER BEHAVIOR

32:00.586 --> 32:03.055
ON HER PART TOWARDS A STUDENT,
WE WILL PROSECUTE.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.091
- OH, MY GOD, NO.
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.726
JOANNE IS JUST
EMOTIONALLY VULNERABLE.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.728
- AND THAT'S WHY
SHE LEFT?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.330
- WELL, BASICALLY YES.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.966
SHE SORT OF HAD
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.236
SHE SAID SHE JUST COULD NOT
CONTINUE TEACHING HERE.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.205
- DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHY?

32:19.238 --> 32:22.408
- SHE WAS VERY CLOSE TO
ANOTHER OF OUR INSTRUCTORS HERE,

32:22.441 --> 32:26.712
A LISA RONCARDI.
ACTUALLY, IT'S LISA WIENS NOW.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.447
SHE LEFT TEACHING
TO GET MARRIED.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.083
THAT'S WHEN JOANNE
JUST FELL APART.

32:31.117 --> 32:34.120
- WHEN A FELLOW TEACHER
GOT MARRIED?

32:34.153 --> 32:37.156
- WELL, I THINK SHE FELT
SHE LOST A FRIEND.

32:38.224 --> 32:40.659
JOANNE REALLY BELONGS
IN ANOTHER ERA.

32:40.692 --> 32:44.396
THIS ONE IS JUST
TOO HARSH FOR HER.

32:44.430 --> 32:47.199
- SO JOANNE PARSONS
COULD BE A LESBIAN?

32:47.233 --> 32:48.334
- GRACIAS.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.336
I TRACKED DOWN
A FORMER COLLEAGUE.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.738
HER STORY IS THAT
JOANNE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.740
UNREQUITED, BUT--
- EITHER WAY,

32:54.773 --> 32:57.476
JOANNE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE INTERESTED IN MEN OR BOYS.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.245
- SO HOW DID LUCA KNOW
ABOUT THE BIRTHMARK?

32:59.278 --> 33:00.679
- MAYBE SOMEBODY
TOLD HIM,

33:00.712 --> 33:02.348
SOMEBODY THAT SHE'D BEEN
INTIMATE WITH.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.150
[text alert sounds]
- THEN WHY DIDN'T JOANNE

33:04.183 --> 33:06.285
JUST EXPLAIN THAT?
I MEAN, EVEN IF SHE IS CLOSETED,

33:06.318 --> 33:07.419
SHE'S NOT GOING TO
WANT TO GO TO JAIL

33:07.453 --> 33:09.088
FOR A CRIME SHE DIDN'T COMMIT.
- HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.423
- I MEAN,
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.225
- OH, MY GOD.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.194
JOANNE JUST TRIED
TO KILL HERSELF.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.695
- WHAT?

33:16.728 --> 33:19.765
- "TWO HOURS AGO, SHE FILLED
HER POCKETS WITH STONES

33:19.798 --> 33:22.134
AND WALKED
INTO PROSPECT PARK LAKE."

33:22.168 --> 33:24.236
- WHO IS SHE,
VIRGINIA WOOLF?

33:24.270 --> 33:26.705
- SHE'S ON SUICIDE WATCH
AT BROOKLYN GENERAL.

33:26.738 --> 33:31.677
- LIV, BRING HER SOME FLOWERS
OR A SACHET OF LAVENDER.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.782
- HEY.
- [gasps]

33:36.815 --> 33:41.253
LIL-LILIES.
LILIES, THEY'RE SO LOVELY.

33:41.287 --> 33:45.257
- YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT CAN BE
DEPRESSING HERE, SO--

33:45.291 --> 33:46.658
- THANK YOU.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.129
- JOANNE, I KNOW THIS IS
VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT,

33:50.162 --> 33:55.467
BUT HELP ME UNDERSTAND
HOW WE GOT HERE.

33:55.501 --> 34:02.141
- I NEVER TOUCHED LUCA.
I WOULD NEVER TOUCH A STUDENT.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.543
- I BELIEVE YOU,
JOANNE,

34:04.576 --> 34:06.212
BUT CAN YOU HELP ME
FIGURE OUT

34:06.245 --> 34:10.782
HOW HE COULD DESCRIBE
YOUR BEDROOM, YOUR BODY.

34:10.816 --> 34:13.652
- HE'S NEVER SEEN ME UNDRESSED.
HE'S NEVER--

34:13.685 --> 34:15.554
- OKAY,
SO SOMEONE ELSE HAS.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.790
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE

34:18.824 --> 34:23.295
THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH
BETRAYED YOU?

34:23.329 --> 34:25.331
- NO, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

34:25.364 --> 34:29.535
- SO EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.138
- [sighs]

34:32.171 --> 34:34.706
WE'RE DEAR FRIENDS.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.608
- YOU AND NATALIE.

34:36.642 --> 34:38.477
- UH--

34:38.510 --> 34:42.581
- DID YOU MEET
AND BECOME FRIENDS AT SCHOOL?

34:42.614 --> 34:45.317
- WE MET LAST MAY.
SHE CAME TO THE SCHOOL

34:45.351 --> 34:47.853
TO INTERVIEW
WITH ME AND MR. OVERBY.

34:47.886 --> 34:51.690
SHE WAS JUST SO LOVELY,
AND--AND KIND.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.725
- AND YOU APPRECIATED
THE SAME THINGS.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.461
- WHICH IS RARE.
WE--WE--

34:55.494 --> 34:58.864
WE WENT TO THE BOTANICAL GARDENS
AND--AND TO POETRY READINGS.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.133
- YOUR HOME,
WHICH IS SO BEAUTIFUL,

35:01.167 --> 35:03.802
SHE MUST HAVE
LOVED THAT.

35:03.835 --> 35:07.306
- WE WERE JUST
SO CONTENT.

35:07.339 --> 35:12.511
- SO WHAT HAPPENED?
WHY DID THE FRIENDSHIP END?

35:12.544 --> 35:14.513
- IT WAS LUCA,
WASN'T IT?

35:14.546 --> 35:16.482
- YES.
YOU'VE MET HIM.

35:16.515 --> 35:20.819
HE'S--HE'S A MANIPULATOR,
AND HE'S A LIAR.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.489
- DID NATALIE TELL YOU
THAT HE SEDUCED HER?

35:23.522 --> 35:25.591
- NO.
I SAW THEM TOGETHER

35:25.624 --> 35:28.760
AT THE SCHOOL
IN THE RARE BOOK ARCHIVE.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.563
SHE TURNED TO ME
WITH SUCH A LOOK OF SADNESS.

35:31.597 --> 35:34.600
SHE PROMISED
SHE WOULD STOP.

35:36.768 --> 35:37.669
- BUT SHE DIDN'T.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.905
- NO, AND THEN
THE NEXT WEEK THEY TOOK ME

35:39.938 --> 35:44.643
TO MR. OVERBY'S OFFICE,
AND LUCA ACCUSED RICK SIMMS.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.645
- THIS IS RIGHT AFTER
YOU CONFRONTED HER,

35:46.678 --> 35:50.249
RIGHT AFTER
SHE ADMITTED TO IT.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.750
WHAT DID YOU THINK
WAS GOING ON?

35:51.783 --> 35:54.353
- LUCA IS VERY CLEVER.
HE WAS WORRIED

35:54.386 --> 35:57.356
THAT I WOULD SAY SOMETHING,
AND SO HE ACCUSED MR. SIMMS.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.690
- HE CAME UP
WITH A COVER STORY.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.892
- YES, AND LOOK
HOW WELL IT WORKED.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.528
I MEAN,
HOW COULD I SAY,

36:02.561 --> 36:06.532
"NO, IT'S NOT MR. SIMMS,
IT'S NATALIE?"

36:06.565 --> 36:09.835
IF I HAD TOLD
THE TRUTH...

36:09.868 --> 36:13.572
IT--IT WOULD HAVE
DESTROYED HER.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.210
- JOANNE'S BEEN REPRESSED.
SHE'S BEEN LIVING A LIE.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.279
IT FINALLY
CAUGHT UP TO HER.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.813
- HER LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN
A WHOLE LOT EASIER

36:21.847 --> 36:23.949
IF SHE'D COME OUT.
- I DON'T KNOW.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.685
KEN AND ALEJANDRO ARE OUT,
AND LOOK WHERE IT GOT THEM.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.687
- NATALIE RELAIS
IS HERE WITH A LAWYER.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.856
THEY'RE READY FOR US.

36:32.458 --> 36:35.761
- SEX IN THE BOOK ARCHIVE?

36:35.794 --> 36:39.698
NO. JOANNE SAW ME
COMFORTING LUCA.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.568
HE WAS UPSET.
OH...

36:42.601 --> 36:45.704
NOW I REALIZE
IT WAS ABOUT JOANNE.

36:45.737 --> 36:49.241
WHAT SHE DID TO LUCA
WAS AWFUL,

36:49.275 --> 36:51.710
BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT
FEEL SORRY FOR THE POOR WOMAN.

36:51.743 --> 36:54.880
- WHAT, YOU MEAN
YOUR FORMER LOVER?

36:54.913 --> 36:57.683
RIGHT? YOU TOLD LUCA
ABOUT HER BIRTHMARK.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.851
- JOANNE HAS FANTASIZED
A RELATIONSHIP

36:59.885 --> 37:01.019
WHERE THERE WAS NONE.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.921
THE WOMAN
IS EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.657
- BUT YOU HAVE BEEN
TO HER HOME?

37:05.691 --> 37:08.960
- NO. [chuckles]

37:08.994 --> 37:10.662
SHE INVITED ME.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.599
I SAID I WOULD COME,
BUT SHE LIVES IN BROOKLYN.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.368
I MEAN, WHAT WERE WE
GOING TO DO?

37:16.402 --> 37:17.803
CROCHET?
[chuckles]

37:17.836 --> 37:22.741
- AND THIS BOOK.
DID YOU GIVE IT TO HER?

37:22.774 --> 37:24.776
- SHE GAVE ME A COPY
FOR CHRISTMAS.

37:24.810 --> 37:25.744
- HMM.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.680
- I STARTED TO THINK
SHE HAD A CRUSH ON ME.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.682
I DIDN'T REALIZE
SHE GOES FOR BOYS.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.552
[sighs]
I AM SO SORRY.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.754
I JUST DIDN'T SEE
THAT SIDE OF HER.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.763
- SHE'S LYING.
EVERY TIME HER LIPS MOVE.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.632
JOANNE WALKED IN
ON HER AND LUCA,

37:46.665 --> 37:48.634
AND THEY FRAMED SIMMS
AS A COVER STORY.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.336
- WHY SIMMS?

37:50.369 --> 37:51.703
- WELL, HE'S NEW TO THE SCHOOL,
HE'S AN OUTSIDER.

37:51.737 --> 37:52.771
HE'S A PERFECT SCAPEGOAT,

37:52.804 --> 37:54.740
AND WHEN THAT FELL APART,
THEY TURNED ON JOANNE.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.908
- SMART.
NOW IT'S JOANNE'S WORD

37:56.942 --> 37:58.644
AGAINST LUCA'S AND NATALIE'S,

37:58.677 --> 38:01.747
AND JOANNE LOOKS THE LEAST
STABLE OF THE THREE OF THEM.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.782
- WAIT,
SO A SEXUAL PREDATOR

38:03.815 --> 38:05.984
WHO RUINED TWO OTHER TEACHERS'
LIVES JUST WALKS?

38:06.017 --> 38:07.786
- YOU WANT TO TRY THIS CASE?
- OKAY,

38:07.819 --> 38:09.655
SO WE CAN'T CHARGE HER
RIGHT NOW.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.390
WE COULD AT LEAST
TELL THE SCHOOL

38:11.423 --> 38:14.793
AND LUCA'S PARENTS
WHAT'S GOING ON.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.063
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:18.096 --> 38:20.566
- ALEJANDRO
HAD EMERGENCY SURGERY.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.934
HE'S IN A COMA.
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.070
- LET ME DRIVE YOU.

38:25.103 --> 38:27.105
- CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD.
IS HE OKAY?

38:27.138 --> 38:28.974
- STILL OUT.
HE HASN'T COME TO YET.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.442
- WHAT'D THE DOCTOR SAY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.777
I CAN'T GO IN.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.712
- WHAT HAPPENED?

38:33.745 --> 38:35.080
- WHEN ALEJANDRO
WENT BACK INTO SURGERY,

38:35.113 --> 38:36.948
I THOUGHT I SHOULD
CALL HIS FATHER.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.051
HE SHOWED UP, HE SAW ME
HOLDING ALEJANDRO'S HAND,

38:40.085 --> 38:42.821
HE FLIPPED OUT, TOLD THE STAFF
HE WAS THE NEXT OF KIN.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.523
HE HAD ME
THROWN OUT OF THE ROOM.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.425
- WHERE IS HE?
- DAD!

38:46.458 --> 38:51.663
- HE'S A FATHER. I'M A FATHER.
AT LEAST LET ME TALK TO HIM.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.465
KEN...

38:53.499 --> 38:57.102
FOR ONCE,
LET ME DO SOMETHING FOR YOU.

38:57.135 --> 38:59.438
I GOT THIS.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.576
- JUST VISITED LUCA'S
FATHER AT RIKERS.

39:04.610 --> 39:07.646
YOU KNOW, WHEN HE THOUGHT
SIMMS MOLESTED HIS SON,

39:07.679 --> 39:09.715
HE HAD THE GUY
GAY BASHED.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.583
- LET ME GUESS.
AND NOW THAT IT'S NATALIE,

39:11.617 --> 39:14.586
HE THINKS THE KID'S LUCKY.
- WELL, HE SEEMS PROUD OF HIM.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.455
- NATALIE ABUSED LUCA,

39:16.488 --> 39:17.689
BUT BECAUSE
SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

39:17.723 --> 39:18.924
INSTEAD OF GETTING HELP,

39:18.957 --> 39:20.459
HE'S GOING TO BE GETTING
HIGH FIVES.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.993
- OH, YEAH.
- MAYBE NOT.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.762
LUCA JUST
WENT OFF THE DEEP END.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.464
HE LOCKED HIMSELF
IN THE BIOLOGY LAB,

39:25.497 --> 39:27.933
AND HE'S TAKEN NATALIE
HOSTAGE.

39:35.841 --> 39:40.145
- LUCA, SHE DID THIS
TO YOU.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.448
SHE TOYED WITH YOU.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.915
YOU'RE JUST A KID.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.951
YOU GOT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
IN FRONT OF YOU.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.787
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

39:48.820 --> 39:52.524
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO DO THIS, ALL RIGHT?

39:52.558 --> 39:54.660
THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY...

39:54.693 --> 39:57.863
REALLY ANGRY GUYS OUTSIDE.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.165
AND THEY DON'T CARE
IF YOU WALK OUT OF HERE

40:00.198 --> 40:02.901
OR IF THEY CARRY YOU OUT.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

40:02.934 --> 40:05.571
I CARE.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.674
SO JUST...

40:08.707 --> 40:11.643
JUST PUT DOWN THE KNIFE
AND TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY?

40:14.212 --> 40:18.784
- I BOUGHT US
BUS TICKETS TO MONTREAL.

40:18.817 --> 40:21.920
I TOLD NATALIE
I COULD SPEAK FRENCH.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.089
WE COULD
GET A PLACE THERE.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.094
SHE SAID
THAT WASN'T HAPPENING,

40:29.127 --> 40:32.531
THAT WE HAD TO STOP
SEEING EACH OTHER

40:32.564 --> 40:36.568
AND THAT WE COULDN'T TELL
ANYONE ABOUT US.

40:36.602 --> 40:39.571
AND I TOLD HER
I COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER.

40:44.042 --> 40:47.513
SHE LAUGHED.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.749
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?
WHY WOULD SHE LAUGH?

40:50.782 --> 40:52.183
- I DON'T KNOW.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.553
I'M SORRY
SHE LAUGHED AT YOU.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.589
- SHE SAID
SHE HAD A FIANCE IN L.A.

40:59.725 --> 41:03.729
SHE--SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS--
SHE WAS GETTING MARRIED IN JUNE.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.600
I LOVED HER.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.639
I LOVED HER.

41:13.672 --> 41:17.275
- I KNOW YOU DID.

41:17.308 --> 41:22.781
IT'S OKAY, ALL RIGHT?
IT'S OVER NOW.

41:26.852 --> 41:30.188
JUST GIVE ME
THAT KNIFE.

41:30.221 --> 41:33.258
LUCA.

41:33.291 --> 41:36.227
GIVE ME THE KNIFE.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.036
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.207
[whispering]
IT'S ALL RIGHT. OKAY?

42:07.793 --> 42:10.095
- THOUGHT I'D LET YOU KNOW
THE GUYS YOU I.D.ed,

42:10.128 --> 42:11.830
WE GOT 'EM.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.766
THEY'RE GOING DOWN
FOR FEDERAL HATE CRIMES,

42:14.800 --> 42:17.869
AND THEY'RE NEVER
GETTIN' OUT.

42:21.072 --> 42:26.645
SINCE YOU'RE GONNA BE
MY SON-IN-LAW,

42:26.678 --> 42:29.981
I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T GET
A CHANCE TO MEET BEFORE THIS.
