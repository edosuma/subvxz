00:56.048 --> 00:58.581
Oh! Finally!

00:59.713 --> 01:00.781
You're still down by 10.

01:02.385 --> 01:04.052
Check. You beat me at everything.

01:04.053 --> 01:05.827
Let me be better
at something. Okay?

01:05.828 --> 01:06.455
Come on. You ready?

01:06.456 --> 01:08.558
Come on, come on. Ah!

01:12.128 --> 01:14.028
All right, all right,
all right. Here it is.

01:14.062 --> 01:15.595
Game point.

01:15.629 --> 01:16.823
Rizzoli-Rizzoli.

01:16.824 --> 01:18.264
Take the shot!

01:18.298 --> 01:19.733
Yeah. Oh!

01:20.241 --> 01:21.279
Hey, hey, you all right?

01:21.280 --> 01:22.783
Yeah, yeah. No, no.
Come on, let me see it.

01:22.784 --> 01:24.450
No, I'm good. Aw!

01:24.485 --> 01:26.153
What? No, no, no, no.
That's bad. Come on.

01:26.188 --> 01:27.900
Bad? Yeah, let's get you some ice.

01:27.901 --> 01:28.924
Hold your head up,
hold your head up.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.626
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:30.660 --> 01:32.162
All right, all right.
All right, just don't touch.

01:32.196 --> 01:33.297
Oh, yeah, that's broken. Oh, yeah.

01:33.331 --> 01:34.498
It's broken? Let me see.

01:34.533 --> 01:35.882
Ow! God! Hey! Okay, okay.

01:35.883 --> 01:36.751
Why you got to do that?

01:36.752 --> 01:38.204
Well, let's get some
ice on it! Come on!

01:38.238 --> 01:39.272
Hurry up.

01:39.306 --> 01:40.189
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:40.190 --> 01:42.186
Keep it up, keep it up. It's up.

01:42.187 --> 01:43.466
Get something before
mom comes home.

01:43.467 --> 01:44.689
All right, all right, all right.
Here. Thank you very much.

01:44.723 --> 01:46.519
There you go. Thank you.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.021
On the good towel!

01:48.022 --> 01:49.523
What?

01:49.558 --> 01:51.459
Excuse me. Aah!

01:51.493 --> 01:54.697
What happened?! God!

01:54.731 --> 01:57.367
How do you always manage
to turn Sunday dinner

01:57.401 --> 02:00.805
into a circus every week?

02:00.839 --> 02:01.569
Me? Yeah, you.

02:01.570 --> 02:03.641
It was my fault. I did it.
It's his fault!

02:03.676 --> 02:05.510
No, I know you
didn't mean to do it.

02:05.545 --> 02:07.079
So this is my fault?

02:07.114 --> 02:09.449
Look, I tell you all the time,

02:09.484 --> 02:11.853
don't roughhouse with him!

02:14.926 --> 02:19.225
Oh, someone, uh -
bird! Bird keeps calling you.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.593
Detective Crowe?

02:21.126 --> 02:22.260
You answered my phone?

02:22.294 --> 02:23.595
Ma, why didn't you just tell me?!

02:23.629 --> 02:26.399
Because you were
having so much fun

02:26.433 --> 02:28.383
having your... Rizzoli.

02:28.384 --> 02:30.409
It's Frost. Bad things
in West Roxbury.

02:30.410 --> 02:31.637
All right, I'll be right there.

02:31.638 --> 02:34.211
Dad and Tommy are gonna be
here any minute for dinner.

02:34.212 --> 02:35.979
I told you I was on call.

02:36.014 --> 02:40.418
Here. It won't be attractive
if your nose swells up.

02:40.453 --> 02:43.922
You never know who
you might run into.

02:43.957 --> 02:45.324
Ma. What?

02:45.359 --> 02:47.093
'Cause I meet so many
great guys at work.

02:47.127 --> 02:50.097
Too bad they're all dead. Huh?

02:50.131 --> 02:53.300
Ow. Later, jerk.

02:53.335 --> 02:54.034
I'm sorry. No, you're not.

02:54.069 --> 02:55.303
Okay. Have fun! Yeah, thanks.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.834
News of a brutal murder

03:21.835 --> 03:24.552
of a doctor in an upscale
Bellevue Hill neighborhood

03:24.553 --> 03:27.341
in West Roxbury
shocked and terrified

03:27.375 --> 03:29.510
this tight-knit community...

03:31.847 --> 03:34.015
It's the coroner. Go, go.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.685
Dr. Isles, what can you
tell us about the murder?

03:36.719 --> 03:39.222
I'll have a statement for
you later tonight, kitty.

03:40.691 --> 03:43.325
Detective. What's up, doc?

03:43.359 --> 03:45.225
Evening, Dr. Isles. 
Hello, Casey.

03:45.260 --> 03:48.060
Dr. Maura Isles, chief
medical examiner.

03:50.462 --> 03:52.896
Come on, it's your lucky day.

03:53.393 --> 03:54.635
Can't say this on camera,

03:54.636 --> 03:57.498
but we call Dr. Isles "Queen of the dead."

03:57.532 --> 03:58.832
What's that, Crowe?

03:58.867 --> 04:00.701
Oh, geez, take a midol.

04:00.735 --> 04:01.701
Commander cleared you?

04:01.736 --> 04:03.369
What's it to you? It's my case.

04:03.404 --> 04:06.072
Since when? I'm up.
I got clearance. Move.

04:06.106 --> 04:08.407
I just spoke to the commander.
It's my case. Where's Frost?

04:08.441 --> 04:10.375
Losing his lunch... where else?

04:11.577 --> 04:12.677
God.

04:12.712 --> 04:14.245
He should've stayed in robbery.

04:14.279 --> 04:16.747
Hangnails make him gag.
Guy gives us a bad name.

04:16.781 --> 04:18.649
Hey, come on. Leave him alone.

04:19.950 --> 04:22.251
You okay, buddy? Something I ate.

04:24.287 --> 04:25.664
Where's the crime scene?

04:25.665 --> 04:28.056
Follow your nose.
Might bring back some memories.

04:28.090 --> 04:29.357
What's that supposed to mean?

04:29.391 --> 04:30.491
You'll see.

04:30.526 --> 04:33.727
Have fun, Rizzoli.

04:36.564 --> 04:38.232
Hands hurt?

04:38.266 --> 04:39.766
It's gonna rain.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.401
Rizzoli... homicide Victor 825.

04:42.436 --> 04:46.538
Going back for more, Frost?

04:54.611 --> 04:58.441
Wow. Not in south
Boston anymore, Dorothy.

05:01.778 --> 05:03.545
Korsak, I thought you
were on vacation.

05:03.579 --> 05:05.214
Cut it short.

05:05.777 --> 05:06.882
That bad?

05:06.917 --> 05:08.517
Worse.

05:23.874 --> 05:24.999
Oh, man.

05:26.497 --> 05:27.863
10 centimeters.

05:27.864 --> 05:28.996
Jane, if you got this,

05:28.997 --> 05:31.505
I can start processing
the rest of the house.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.706
Yeah, go ahead.

05:35.342 --> 05:38.077
Carotid artery and jugular
have been transected.

05:38.111 --> 05:40.612
What's odd is how precise it is.

05:44.350 --> 05:46.450
Hairline fracture
of the nasal bone

05:46.485 --> 05:48.118
above the lateral nasal cartilage.

05:48.954 --> 05:49.893
It's not disfiguring.

05:49.894 --> 05:51.555
Looks pretty disfiguring to me.

05:52.357 --> 05:54.490
Can you pop this out for me?

05:55.114 --> 05:58.027
Can't you do something
safe, like yoga?

05:58.061 --> 05:59.228
Might hurt a little.

05:59.262 --> 06:00.520
Okay.

06:01.518 --> 06:03.832
Hmm. Okay.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.398
Ow! "A little"?

06:06.399 --> 06:08.494
Put some ice on it
for the next 24 hours

06:08.495 --> 06:09.466
so you don't look like Mike Tyson.

06:09.467 --> 06:11.166
Ooh! Ow! Mnh!

06:11.200 --> 06:13.133
Victim is Dr. Martin Yeager, 34.

06:13.168 --> 06:15.669
Wife, Gail, is missing.

06:15.703 --> 06:17.770
Diamond was too small so she
whacked him and walked out?

06:17.805 --> 06:21.374
No. We found signs
of forced entry.

06:23.444 --> 06:25.745
Well-to-do couple.

06:25.779 --> 06:30.582
Man is bound and posed.
Woman is missing.

06:34.653 --> 06:35.887
And a teacup.

06:44.761 --> 06:47.495
Is he out? Is the surgeon out?

06:47.529 --> 06:52.032
Oh, my God. Korsak?

06:52.066 --> 06:53.100
He's not out. Itl.

06:53.134 --> 06:53.934
Why didn't you warn us -
warn Jane, at least?

06:53.968 --> 06:55.402
I wanted your unbiased assessment.

06:55.436 --> 06:57.370
Looks like Hoyt, right?

06:57.404 --> 06:59.404
Korsak, we put that son
of a bitch behind bars.

06:59.439 --> 07:00.972
You tell me how this is possible.

07:01.006 --> 07:02.773
It's not. I spoke with
the prison authorities.

07:02.808 --> 07:04.275
He's in lockdown.

07:07.580 --> 07:10.680
Look, stun-gun marks, right
there, just like Hoyt's victims.

07:10.714 --> 07:12.281
Any sick perp could've done this

07:12.315 --> 07:14.183
if he watched the tv
news and read a paper.

07:14.218 --> 07:15.551
We got a copycat.

07:15.586 --> 07:17.653
Except we didn't
release this detail.

07:18.922 --> 07:21.991
Hoyt's trained an apprentice.

07:32.970 --> 07:35.533
Hey, uh, can I get a scanner
from you? Thank you.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.636
He's coming out of rigor.
You want us to crack him?

07:39.670 --> 07:40.804
No, put him on his side.

07:42.206 --> 07:45.008
Hoyt's the reason you don't
want to be partners, isn't he?

07:45.042 --> 07:46.742
You know why...

07:47.256 --> 07:50.246
I'm allergic to all those sad
and furry little creatures

07:50.280 --> 07:52.582
you keep rescuing,
Detective Dolittle.

07:52.616 --> 07:54.683
You never sneezed. 
Hello.

07:55.819 --> 07:57.586
Special Agent Gabriel Dean.

07:57.620 --> 08:01.556
You must be Detective Rizzoli.

08:01.590 --> 08:04.957
And you must be Dr. Maura Isles.

08:06.449 --> 08:08.693
What's the FBI doing here?

08:08.727 --> 08:11.729
Saw the homicide advisory...
And possible kidnapping.

08:11.763 --> 08:13.764
We have an APB out on Gail Yeager.

08:13.798 --> 08:15.032
Yeah, so do we.

08:15.066 --> 08:16.400
You get a lot of
routine advisories.

08:16.434 --> 08:18.101
What so special about this one?

08:18.612 --> 08:21.199
Hey, you know we're on
the same side, right?

08:21.890 --> 08:22.906
Are we?

08:23.203 --> 08:25.573
Oh, 'cause, you
know, you fed boys,

08:25.574 --> 08:27.941
you like to show up, take
the bat and the ball.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.078
Just here to observe.

08:35.614 --> 08:36.880
Right.

08:38.715 --> 08:41.250
Jane, I'll be doing the
autopsy in the morning.

08:41.284 --> 08:43.152
Okay. Come if you like.

08:48.786 --> 08:50.727
Hey, Rizzoli. Yeah?

08:50.761 --> 08:52.628
Semen.

08:56.201 --> 08:59.807
So he raped the wife and
made the husband watch...

08:59.841 --> 09:01.809
Just like Hoyt.

09:29.630 --> 09:31.363
Look at me. Look at me!

09:39.721 --> 09:43.539
Jane... how lovely to see you.

09:44.608 --> 09:47.276
Haven't seen you since the trial.

09:47.310 --> 09:48.910
Get his ass in the chair.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.618
I like that scent...

09:58.652 --> 10:02.688
the smell of lavender and fear.

10:02.722 --> 10:05.457
See one. Do one. Teach one.

10:05.491 --> 10:08.560
That's what they taught
you in medical school.

10:08.594 --> 10:09.994
Who did you teach, Hoyt?

10:10.028 --> 10:12.930
I dropped out, Jane.
I mean, you know that.

10:12.964 --> 10:16.533
You were kicked out...
For fondling a corpse.

10:21.138 --> 10:22.905
That's very good, Jane.

10:22.939 --> 10:25.039
You've learned how to irritate me.

10:28.744 --> 10:31.678
I want to see them.

10:31.712 --> 10:34.347
Hands are so useful.

10:34.381 --> 10:36.682
Dexterous.

10:36.716 --> 10:39.785
And yours played the piano.
Do they still work?

11:01.672 --> 11:05.407
Good as new.

11:05.442 --> 11:08.610
So...Your turn.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.512
You trained somebody, didn't you?

11:11.546 --> 11:13.646
I love...

11:13.681 --> 11:15.113
Your neck.

11:15.148 --> 11:18.349
It's so beautiful.

11:18.384 --> 11:21.385
And your breasts...

11:21.419 --> 11:23.253
Very firm.

11:23.287 --> 11:25.422
Answer the question.

11:29.296 --> 11:30.963
Tell me, Jane...

11:30.998 --> 11:35.869
What would you like to do to me?

11:39.841 --> 11:41.708
I'd like to get my gun...

11:42.977 --> 11:45.545
...And put it in your mouth
and pull the trigger.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.313
No, no, no, no, no.

11:47.348 --> 11:51.484
It is so much better
slowly, to take your time.

11:52.158 --> 11:53.586
You know, all my life,

11:53.620 --> 11:56.488
I've been meticulous about
finishing what I start.

11:56.523 --> 11:57.923
And that bothers me,

11:57.957 --> 12:00.359
because I haven't finished
what I started with you.

12:00.394 --> 12:03.130
And you won't, you sick scumbag.

12:05.167 --> 12:07.804
Do you dream about me, Jane?

12:08.396 --> 12:10.195
'Cause I dream about you.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.559
I don't even think about you.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.883
But I'll tell you what -
I'll visit you every damn day

12:14.884 --> 12:17.104
if you tell me who your friend is.

12:17.105 --> 12:20.370
Who killed Dr. Yeager, here's his wife?

12:25.449 --> 12:28.785
I see that our time's up.

12:35.048 --> 12:37.783
I do dream about you.

12:39.986 --> 12:40.968
Am I ever your lover?

12:40.969 --> 12:43.921
That's enough, you son of a bitch!
That's enough!

12:43.956 --> 12:45.623
All right, all right, all right.

12:50.808 --> 12:53.300
You're right, Jane.

12:53.301 --> 12:54.895
I should play fair.

12:55.454 --> 12:57.655
My friend is out there.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.356
Enjoy him.

13:01.092 --> 13:03.494
Because he'll enjoy you.

13:13.764 --> 13:16.003
Rizzoli.

13:37.876 --> 13:40.744
Hey, uh, I'll catch up.

13:58.727 --> 14:00.494
Are you wearing lipstick, Rizzoli?

14:00.528 --> 14:01.728
Shut up.

14:01.763 --> 14:03.631
Dog find her? Yeah.
Lucky he got loose.

14:03.665 --> 14:05.101
We wouldn't have found
her till summer.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.969
Who's a good boy?

14:08.572 --> 14:10.472
How'd you get here so fast?

14:10.507 --> 14:12.608
I was in the area.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.578
Everybody's so lucky today.

14:20.251 --> 14:22.117
Vitreous potassium.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.291
Helps us determine
postmortem interval.

14:25.325 --> 14:28.895
Nice and clear... about 36 hours.

14:29.930 --> 14:33.501
Look at the body, the
way it's laid out...

14:33.535 --> 14:37.038
like she's taking a nap
or reading a novel.

14:37.072 --> 14:39.074
It's odd, isn't it?

14:39.108 --> 14:41.509
Yeah, why didn't he bury her?

14:42.811 --> 14:44.145
Didn't have time.

14:46.514 --> 14:49.115
That means something.

14:50.852 --> 14:52.519
Aah!

14:58.719 --> 14:59.519
Where's Frost?

14:59.553 --> 15:01.154
Ah, paperwork.

15:01.188 --> 15:03.556
Oh. Wiping his face
with it after he puked?

15:06.037 --> 15:08.226
Did you do a wet prep yet?

15:09.628 --> 15:13.664
I hadn't planned to. But I can.

15:19.069 --> 15:21.670
Those little guys
really are swimmers.

15:22.773 --> 15:23.929
Quite fresh.

15:23.930 --> 15:25.855
Deposited postmortem.

15:25.856 --> 15:27.190
Ugh.

15:27.224 --> 15:28.197
How did you know?

15:28.198 --> 15:30.071
I didn't. Yes, you did.

15:30.508 --> 15:31.941
It's not standard procedure

15:31.975 --> 15:34.510
to check for evidence
of necrophilia.

15:34.544 --> 15:37.479
You want to tell us why
you're really here?

15:37.513 --> 15:39.748
I'd like a copy of your report...

15:39.782 --> 15:42.916
as a courtesy.

16:14.476 --> 16:17.278
Let's go, Hoyt. You got
your one hour on the yard.

16:18.613 --> 16:20.914
He's faking. Be careful.

16:36.194 --> 16:39.363
I found carpet fiber
on Gail Yeager's body.

16:39.397 --> 16:42.866
Lab is processing it.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.036
Thanks.

16:46.004 --> 16:48.171
Hoyt didn't meet his
apprentice in prison

16:48.857 --> 16:51.741
or medical school -
all 80 classmates are clean.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.588
You guys eating cat food?

16:55.622 --> 16:57.422
Yeah, you want some?

16:57.457 --> 16:58.823
No.

16:58.858 --> 17:01.159
Guess it's a chick thing.

17:02.128 --> 17:03.494
What's up?

17:03.529 --> 17:05.663
You may want to sit down.

17:05.696 --> 17:06.997
No. Tell me.

17:07.031 --> 17:08.931
A few hours ago, uh,

17:08.965 --> 17:12.634
Charles Hoyt escaped custody.

17:15.671 --> 17:17.371
Oh, my God.

17:20.642 --> 17:22.943
Why wasn't he cuffed?

17:22.978 --> 17:25.279
Two doctors have assured me he
was suffering from appendicitis.

17:25.313 --> 17:27.180
200 milligrams of decadron

17:27.214 --> 17:28.948
would give him an
abnormal white-cell count.

17:28.983 --> 17:30.721
It mimics all the symptoms.

17:30.722 --> 17:33.852
Doesn't explain how
he got out of here.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.220
What's he doing?

17:40.327 --> 17:42.117
It's a message for me.

17:45.203 --> 17:47.131
Go stay with mom and dad.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.670
No. I am staying in my own home.

17:49.671 --> 17:51.805
He's not gonna do
this to me again.

17:51.839 --> 17:54.874
Frost, go get some sleep.
I'm fine.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.009
If I was a guy, you wouldn't
be worried like this.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.343
You're not a guy.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.811
No, I am a homicide detective.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.446
And he is not gonna kill me.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.619
Really? Well, he almost
did the last time.

18:03.620 --> 18:04.581
I mean, look at your hands!

18:04.582 --> 18:05.829
Hey, Frankie, come on.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.784
Please take him.

18:08.498 --> 18:10.766
We'll be outside.

18:12.035 --> 18:14.502
All right, all right, that's
the way you want it, fine.

18:14.537 --> 18:17.032
But if you have a boyfriend
over, we'll know. How's that?

18:41.699 --> 18:43.145
Hey, Marisa. Hey.

18:43.146 --> 18:45.101
I'm so sorry. Did the
vacuum cleaner wake you?

18:45.135 --> 18:47.303
No, no. I was up studying.

18:47.337 --> 18:49.738
Uh, come in, come in, come in.

18:49.772 --> 18:52.373
How's law school? Awful.

18:52.408 --> 18:54.875
Remind me again why I thought
I wanted to be a lawyer.

18:56.544 --> 18:59.313
I know, right? "Where the
hell was I on career day?"

18:59.933 --> 19:02.515
Just making sure you're okay.

19:02.549 --> 19:06.352
Um...Yeah. Why would you ask?

19:06.386 --> 19:09.854
You always vacuum when you
have a really tough case.

19:09.889 --> 19:12.357
Huh.

19:12.391 --> 19:14.058
No!

19:26.869 --> 19:28.670
Mom.

19:29.872 --> 19:33.741
That lipstick doesn't flatter you.
It's too pink, babe.

19:35.343 --> 19:36.977
Bye.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.783
I hope Frankie Jr.'s okay down there.

19:44.818 --> 19:47.286
Hoyt's not after Frankie, ma.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.020
Your father's out there, also.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.722
Oh, my God, did you
bring the dog, too?

19:51.757 --> 19:54.191
Why would I bring the dog?

19:59.068 --> 20:00.707
What, ma?

20:01.065 --> 20:03.433
Oh, come on, it's the
middle of the night.

20:03.467 --> 20:04.868
Who could sleep?

20:04.902 --> 20:07.536
Ever since you had this crazy idea

20:07.571 --> 20:10.172
to become a police officer,

20:10.206 --> 20:11.607
I haven't stopped worrying.

20:11.641 --> 20:13.442
I never know if
you're coming home.

20:13.476 --> 20:17.977
And your brother Frankie wants
to do exactly what you do.

20:18.471 --> 20:21.413
Everything you do, he follows it.

20:21.448 --> 20:23.515
I'm leaving.

20:23.549 --> 20:25.417
You're leaving?
Where are you going?

20:25.451 --> 20:28.186
Someplace where you're not.

20:28.220 --> 20:29.453
Jane.

20:29.488 --> 20:31.722
Jane, come on. Be reasonable.

20:31.756 --> 20:33.757
They don't pay you enough money.

20:33.791 --> 20:36.359
I mean... pfft -
they don't pay me at all.

20:54.408 --> 20:56.242
Why do you always look like

20:56.276 --> 20:58.611
you're about to do a photo shoot?

21:00.079 --> 21:02.080
Thank you.

21:05.584 --> 21:07.284
God, what is that?!

21:07.319 --> 21:09.486
Shh. You'll scare him.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.088
He's alive? His name is Bass.

21:12.123 --> 21:15.424
Geochelone sulcata -
African spurred tortoise.

21:15.458 --> 21:18.093
I've had him since
he was like this big.

21:18.127 --> 21:21.229
He's partial to
British strawberries.

21:21.263 --> 21:22.596
"Bass"?

21:22.630 --> 21:24.564
What, after an old boyfriend?

21:24.599 --> 21:27.200
William M. Bass, the
forensic anthropologist

21:27.234 --> 21:28.601
who founded the famous body farm.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.769
Right, yeah, that... that Bass.

21:30.804 --> 21:32.604
No, it's okay.

21:33.227 --> 21:36.441
Yeah, he's a great pet.
Really interactive, I'll bet.

21:36.475 --> 21:37.809
Mm-hmm.

21:42.981 --> 21:45.615
So, how long can a person
go without sleeping?

21:45.650 --> 21:47.750
Hallucinations begin by day four,

21:47.785 --> 21:52.222
followed by slurred speech,
short attention span, and death.

21:52.256 --> 21:54.324
You're better than Wikipedia.

21:54.358 --> 21:57.260
Well, Wikipedia is
frequently incorrect.

21:57.294 --> 21:58.995
Very little is
rigorously peer-reviewed.

22:02.795 --> 22:05.068
Somebody's just
dropping something off.

22:17.346 --> 22:18.913
Hey.

22:37.761 --> 22:39.762
Go away. I'm asleep.

22:46.502 --> 22:48.202
Are we having a sleepover,

22:48.237 --> 22:51.471
or is this your way of telling
me you're attracted to me?

22:52.873 --> 22:56.674
So it was Dean you were expecting.

22:58.543 --> 23:02.511
He wanted my opinion
on another case.

23:02.993 --> 23:04.084
What case?

23:04.085 --> 23:05.485
I can't say.

23:06.291 --> 23:08.421
Fine. Go sleep in your own room.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.623
Jane...

23:13.159 --> 23:15.760
Did you ever like the same
guy as your best friend?

23:15.795 --> 23:17.095
No.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.663
Did you ever have a best friend?

23:18.697 --> 23:20.097
No.

23:20.132 --> 23:23.133
You'd tell me if you
were a cyborg, right?

23:23.168 --> 23:25.936
No, I don't think I would.

23:28.105 --> 23:29.572
I'm not seeing him.

23:29.606 --> 23:31.607
Yet.

23:31.641 --> 23:33.342
Well, somebody should,
don't you think?

23:33.376 --> 23:35.377
Yup.

23:36.057 --> 23:38.913
Should we draw straws?

23:38.947 --> 23:41.215
Couldn't we just show him
our tits and let him decide?

23:47.521 --> 23:49.956
It's okay. It's just Bass.

23:49.990 --> 23:51.858
Really, it's okay.

24:00.832 --> 24:04.867
I've never been so
scared in all my life.

24:22.667 --> 24:25.335
You look like you slept
under an overpass.

24:25.536 --> 24:27.504
How are you still single?

24:32.276 --> 24:34.143
You got to stop this. Stop what?

24:34.178 --> 24:36.244
This stuff with Frost.

24:36.278 --> 24:38.210
Lab identified the carpet
we found on the victim.

24:38.245 --> 24:40.409
It's called antron.

24:40.443 --> 24:43.145
It... it's not Frost's fault
that he was partnered with me.

24:43.179 --> 24:45.046
Navy-blue carpet from a car.

24:47.082 --> 24:49.049
You want to hear what I
got from the lab or not?

24:49.083 --> 24:50.650
Yeah. You want to
drink the coffee?

24:50.685 --> 24:52.919
Navy blue's a popular color.

24:52.953 --> 24:55.321
2 million vehicles with
this type of carpet fiber.

24:55.355 --> 24:58.123
Swell. Hey, it's not my
fault it's a popular color.

24:59.192 --> 25:00.770
I take three sugar.

25:00.771 --> 25:02.038
Oh, for Christ's sake, since when?

25:02.072 --> 25:03.539
Since I don't know -
since for a while.

25:03.573 --> 25:06.007
You'd know that if we
were still partners.

25:06.041 --> 25:08.475
What about the semen
we found? No hits.

25:08.509 --> 25:09.709
How is that possible?

25:09.744 --> 25:11.911
Easy. Our unsub's not in CODIS.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.246
Ran the prints we
had, too... nothing.

25:14.281 --> 25:15.814
Our unsub's a ghost.

25:15.849 --> 25:19.317
Pardon me... yours and
Frost's unsub's a ghost.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.889
Thought you said you
take three sugar.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.690
Doctor says it's bad for me.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.192
Two sugars is bad for you.
The creamer is bad for you.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.560
Like you care. That's it.

25:37.366 --> 25:38.700
Hey.

25:38.734 --> 25:41.202
About the other day...

25:41.235 --> 25:42.969
I should've given you a heads-up.

25:43.003 --> 25:44.771
It's okay.

25:44.805 --> 25:47.506
No, it... it's not.

25:49.008 --> 25:50.975
I'm sorry.

25:51.009 --> 25:54.512
I'm sorry, too, Korsak.

25:59.551 --> 26:01.451
Rizzoli.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.953
Where?

26:05.221 --> 26:06.355
Okay, page Frost.

26:07.891 --> 26:10.495
I got to go.
They found another victim.

26:28.149 --> 26:31.284
His name is John Ghant.
His wife, Karena, is missing.

26:31.319 --> 26:34.721
No sign of a teacup this time.
You know what that means.

26:34.755 --> 26:36.289
He didn't need a warning device

26:36.323 --> 26:37.957
because he had an accomplice.

26:37.991 --> 26:39.191
Hoyt.

26:39.226 --> 26:41.460
Jane?

26:42.629 --> 26:45.196
You better come see this.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.698
Hey, all I know is,

26:47.732 --> 26:50.400
I got a delivery for a
Detective, uh, Rizzoli.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.369
That's me.

26:56.807 --> 26:58.207
Don't worry about that.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.077
Let me see some form
of identification.

27:00.111 --> 27:01.548
I got it in my back pocket.

27:01.582 --> 27:02.816
Hoyt.

27:02.850 --> 27:05.185
Then who's Henry Deduboto?

27:09.089 --> 27:10.455
"Ted Bundy."

27:10.489 --> 27:13.389
That's five letters too
many for that anagram.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.255
How do you do that?

27:15.289 --> 27:17.289
Fine, "Theodore Bundy."

27:17.323 --> 27:19.423
He was fascinated
with necrophilia,

27:19.458 --> 27:20.658
just like the apprentice.

27:20.692 --> 27:22.894
I bet that's why
Gail Yeager's body

27:22.928 --> 27:24.662
was laid out like his lover.

27:24.697 --> 27:28.199
So he could visit.
Any time he wanted.

27:28.234 --> 27:31.936
But we found her, so
he had to kill again,

27:31.970 --> 27:34.471
this time with Hoyt.

27:34.505 --> 27:35.938
My guess is Karena Ghant
is his new girlfriend.

27:38.141 --> 27:40.741
Frost?

27:40.776 --> 27:42.409
Where?

27:42.444 --> 27:44.645
Keep it off the radio.
Take his phone.

27:44.679 --> 27:47.281
Hide your car, all right?
I'm on my way.

27:48.353 --> 27:51.206
You are not gonna like
what we're about to do.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.857
Only call he made was to 911.

27:55.858 --> 27:57.691
Dispatch put it
straight through to me.

27:57.726 --> 27:59.489
Good. What was he
doing way out here?

27:59.490 --> 28:01.332
Looking for Indian arrowheads.

28:01.333 --> 28:03.001
"Native American."

28:03.035 --> 28:05.570
The wampanoag tribe was the
last to inhabit the area,

28:05.604 --> 28:08.406
also known as the massachusett.

28:08.441 --> 28:10.709
Get him to a uniform.
Take him downtown.

28:10.743 --> 28:13.177
Hold him as long as you can.
Call Korsak, all right?

28:13.212 --> 28:14.779
Get him out here.
Tell him the plan.

28:14.813 --> 28:17.715
I'm on it. What plan?

28:17.749 --> 28:19.149
We're gonna surveille this body.

28:21.602 --> 28:23.965
What, you -
you mean, leave her here?

28:24.629 --> 28:25.679
Yes.

28:25.756 --> 28:27.489
I said you wouldn't like it.
Let's go.

28:27.523 --> 28:30.559
No. I'm calling my team.

28:30.593 --> 28:33.163
Maura, they weren't expecting
anyone to find this body.

28:33.164 --> 28:35.589
Look at where she's hidden.
Okay, hear me out.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.515
Hear me out. We get
the hell out of here.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.485
We put both the park
entrances under surveillance.

28:39.519 --> 28:42.754
What makes you think that Hoyt
isn't watching you right now?

28:42.788 --> 28:45.454
He might be. I am willing
to take that gamble.

28:45.489 --> 28:47.423
What, by leaving this body here

28:47.457 --> 28:48.791
in hopes that they'll return?

28:48.825 --> 28:50.800
No. No, every second
she stays here,

28:50.801 --> 28:53.328
more forensic evidence is lost.

28:54.628 --> 28:56.228
Maura, please.

28:56.262 --> 28:58.263
The faster we get out of here,

28:58.297 --> 29:00.098
the better chance we have
of not being discovered.

29:00.132 --> 29:03.234
Okay? 'Cause if we don't
do this, we got nothing.

29:03.269 --> 29:05.369
If we take this body back now,

29:05.370 --> 29:07.972
all we'll find out
is, "yup, she's dead.

29:08.006 --> 29:10.173
If we take and they killed her."

29:10.208 --> 29:11.574
Please.

29:12.610 --> 29:14.110
Do this for me.

29:31.591 --> 29:34.727
You still got the
north entrance, Frost?

29:34.761 --> 29:36.162
Affirmative.

29:36.196 --> 29:37.763
If you want to go sit
in his car, go ahead.

29:37.798 --> 29:39.498
Shut up. Excuse me?

29:39.532 --> 29:40.833
Not you.

29:40.867 --> 29:43.035
And if they come,
they're coming at night.

29:43.069 --> 29:45.337
So keep your eyes peeled,
all right? Roger that.

29:49.274 --> 29:50.975
What is the smell?

29:51.009 --> 29:52.343
What smell?

29:52.376 --> 29:54.911
You know what smell.
There's an animal in here.

29:57.014 --> 29:59.482
Ugh! Something licked me.
What is it?

29:59.516 --> 30:02.085
Oh, it's just Jo Friday.

30:02.119 --> 30:03.219
He's filthy.

30:03.253 --> 30:04.320
"She."

30:04.816 --> 30:05.672
"Joe"?

30:05.673 --> 30:07.089
"Jo," like "Josephine."

30:07.123 --> 30:09.090
Found her by the side of
the road this morning.

30:12.893 --> 30:14.693
Mnh.

30:14.728 --> 30:16.361
Hey, you sneezed.

30:16.395 --> 30:18.529
I told you, I'm allergic.

30:18.564 --> 30:21.098
Korsak, it's either him or me.

30:23.267 --> 30:25.434
What? Please don't.

30:28.166 --> 30:29.571
Hey, what about him?

30:29.605 --> 30:31.239
"Her."

30:31.274 --> 30:34.808
She stays. I got to pee.

30:34.843 --> 30:36.810
You've got to be kidding me.

30:39.079 --> 30:42.381
Nice...Doggy.

30:42.416 --> 30:45.150
My God, what have you been in?

30:45.185 --> 30:46.685
You got to go. You got to go.

30:59.164 --> 31:02.700
Later that same day. Come on!

31:04.702 --> 31:06.168
Korsak?

31:10.942 --> 31:13.578
Hey!

31:18.519 --> 31:19.785
Korsak?

31:25.090 --> 31:27.991
Korsak! Come on!

31:52.647 --> 31:54.214
Stay down. Stay down!

31:54.248 --> 31:55.815
Stand! Put your hands
on your head now!

31:55.850 --> 31:57.083
Hey, it's me.

31:57.669 --> 31:59.152
What the hell are you doing here?!

31:59.187 --> 32:01.289
I... I was chasing Hoyt.

32:01.323 --> 32:03.156
What do you mean, you
were chasing Hoyt?!

32:03.190 --> 32:05.490
How'd u even know he was here?!

32:05.525 --> 32:06.457
Rizzoli.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.091
Korsak? Hello?

32:08.125 --> 32:11.797
Little help over here.
Officer down.

32:12.648 --> 32:13.736
Officer down.

32:13.737 --> 32:14.970
Korsak.

32:15.004 --> 32:17.004
Officer... hey, man. Hey.

32:17.038 --> 32:17.800
Hey.

32:17.801 --> 32:19.638
Officer down, officer down.

32:19.673 --> 32:20.537
Give me that.

32:20.538 --> 32:22.016
Where are you? On the
other side of the creek.

32:22.017 --> 32:23.220
What's your location?

32:23.740 --> 32:24.801
He snuck up on me.

32:24.802 --> 32:25.967
Okay, okay.

32:26.002 --> 32:27.434
You're gonna be fine. Are they coming?

32:27.435 --> 32:29.002
Yes, they're coming. Okay. Okay.

32:29.036 --> 32:31.409
I'm sorry. You're gonna be fine.
You' gonna be fine.

32:31.410 --> 32:33.848
Let's go. Push the
ambulance here, quick.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.093
Guess where I've been.

32:40.094 --> 32:41.876
How's Korsak? Fine.

32:41.877 --> 32:44.212
No, he's not fi... he'll be fine.

32:44.246 --> 32:46.314
You told Agent Dean where
we were, didn't you?

32:46.348 --> 32:48.383
I did. Without telling me?

32:48.417 --> 32:50.452
I'm sorry. Really? You're sorry?

32:50.487 --> 32:55.023
Because I treated a senior
Federal Agent like a perp.

32:55.057 --> 32:57.492
Tackled him, Maura, in a creek.

32:57.527 --> 32:59.527
Well, that's unfortunate.

32:59.562 --> 33:02.765
But there is a fine line
between courage and stupidity.

33:02.799 --> 33:04.466
Yeah, a fine, thin, blue line.

33:06.604 --> 33:07.671
Thank you.

33:07.705 --> 33:09.807
What? You have a turtle.

33:09.841 --> 33:11.441
Tortoise. Whatever.

33:11.476 --> 33:14.910
Well, at least give her a bath.

33:17.298 --> 33:19.867
Did you actually tackle him?

33:19.868 --> 33:23.497
Yes, like a linebacker.
Very professional.

33:24.124 --> 33:26.892
Wow. You're very brave.

33:26.893 --> 33:29.862
No, I'm simply tired
of being afraid.

33:45.352 --> 33:47.119
How did you get past Frost?

33:48.060 --> 33:49.421
He didn't.

33:49.456 --> 33:51.490
Thank you so much.

33:56.161 --> 33:58.459
If you're looking
for an apology...

33:58.460 --> 34:00.564
I would know to look elsewhere.

34:01.102 --> 34:04.001
Fine, okay. I'm sorry.

34:05.569 --> 34:06.603
Would you like coffee?

34:06.637 --> 34:08.971
Sure. That'd be great.

34:17.591 --> 34:19.090
Your place is really nice.

34:19.091 --> 34:20.623
You sound surprised.

34:21.670 --> 34:24.777
What, like I live in a
sterile little hovel

34:24.777 --> 34:28.230
with my dead plants
and my tv dinners?

34:30.933 --> 34:33.568
So...

34:33.603 --> 34:35.737
Question.

34:37.873 --> 34:40.174
Why did Hoyt come after you?

34:40.998 --> 34:44.842
Hoyt's first victim was mine.

34:44.878 --> 34:47.245
And in case you hadn't noticed,

34:47.279 --> 34:51.060
I seem to be Hoyt's
favorite type... female.

34:52.732 --> 34:54.483
Oh, yeah, I noticed.

34:57.800 --> 35:01.391
And what happened to your hands?

35:02.929 --> 35:04.927
Why are you so
interested in this case?

35:04.961 --> 35:06.762
That's "need to know."

35:06.797 --> 35:09.131
Seriously? You fed
guys actually say that?

35:13.136 --> 35:15.404
I bet you never even once

35:15.439 --> 35:17.373
considered leaving
the force, did you?

35:17.407 --> 35:20.042
Sure, I did...

35:20.076 --> 35:23.345
when Hoyt had me
pinned to the floor

35:23.379 --> 35:25.612
and a scalpel to my throat.

35:30.218 --> 35:31.244
Hey!

35:37.223 --> 35:39.677
And now there are two of them,

35:39.678 --> 35:42.724
hunting me down like
a pack of wolves.

35:47.930 --> 35:49.330
You want me to stay?

35:49.364 --> 35:50.931
Hmm?

35:52.334 --> 35:54.501
No.

35:54.535 --> 35:55.702
No.

35:57.371 --> 36:00.139
I mean, I don't mean no.
I mean no.

36:00.174 --> 36:01.541
Like, no.

36:01.575 --> 36:03.876
Okay. All right.

36:05.245 --> 36:07.479
Well...

36:07.513 --> 36:09.147
Thank you for the coffee.

36:12.584 --> 36:16.052
All right.

36:19.890 --> 36:21.601
Thank you.

36:21.602 --> 36:22.995
Okay.

36:23.592 --> 36:25.893
Good night.

36:29.430 --> 36:31.831
"No"?

36:42.777 --> 36:45.277
God, ma, give it a rest.

36:45.311 --> 36:48.008
Have you been here all day? Yeah.

36:48.042 --> 36:50.576
Whoa, good.

36:50.611 --> 36:51.711
More caffeine.

36:54.579 --> 36:57.545
Mm. Uh, what's my ringtone?

37:05.953 --> 37:09.522
Nice and upbeat.

37:09.556 --> 37:11.591
You should talk to your mom.

37:11.625 --> 37:13.226
She's still mad at me

37:13.260 --> 37:15.728
that I won't come home and
sleep in my pink canopy bed.

37:15.762 --> 37:18.430
Mm. I always wanted a pink canopy.

37:18.464 --> 37:20.732
I wanted a horse.

37:20.766 --> 37:22.016
Please don't tell me that

37:22.017 --> 37:24.068
you always wanted to
dissect dead people.

37:24.103 --> 37:26.037
Okay, I won't.

37:31.308 --> 37:32.841
I have to go

37:32.875 --> 37:35.909
to the forensics lab
at Quantico tomorrow.

37:35.944 --> 37:37.710
In the middle of this?

37:37.744 --> 37:40.646
It's connected to this.

37:40.680 --> 37:43.949
Right. Yeah, here we go again.

37:43.983 --> 37:46.952
Why are you part of the
"need to know" loop and I...

37:46.986 --> 37:48.928
he's trying to kill me.

37:48.929 --> 37:52.189
Jane, this ca-
this case is a lot bigger

37:52.224 --> 37:55.626
and it's far more
complicated than we thought.

37:55.660 --> 37:57.991
I want to tell you.
Great. Fill me in.

37:57.992 --> 38:01.631
I've been ordered not to.
It involves national security.

38:01.665 --> 38:02.932
Are you kidding me?

38:05.302 --> 38:07.770
Jane. Jane!

38:07.804 --> 38:09.377
Jane, where are you going?

38:09.813 --> 38:13.008
I'm sorry. Am I being a
little too loud for you?

38:13.042 --> 38:15.110
Do you ever relax?

38:15.144 --> 38:17.645
No, I don't ever relax!
And you know what else?

38:17.679 --> 38:20.814
I've had it up to here with
your "need to know" bullshit.

38:21.794 --> 38:23.862
I've heard "bullshit" before.

38:23.896 --> 38:25.263
Senator Sam conway,

38:25.297 --> 38:27.431
chairman of the armed
services committee.

38:27.466 --> 38:29.466
Detective Rizzoli.

38:31.535 --> 38:33.202
Sit down.

38:37.906 --> 38:39.974
Where is this?

38:40.008 --> 38:41.776
Kabul, Afghanistan.

38:43.178 --> 38:44.709
It looks like Hoyt's work.

38:44.710 --> 38:48.381
A war zone is a serial
killer's paradise.

38:48.415 --> 38:49.648
Our apprentice is a soldier?

38:49.683 --> 38:51.932
When we first started
investigating these killings,

38:51.933 --> 38:53.284
they looked like war crimes.

38:53.318 --> 38:55.682
So you withheld
crucial information

38:55.683 --> 38:58.174
so you could watch the dumb
Boston cops run around in circles?

38:58.175 --> 38:59.521
You can blame me for that.

38:59.556 --> 39:01.689
This is a very sensitive
investigation.

39:01.724 --> 39:04.625
We believe the apprentice
finished his tours,

39:04.659 --> 39:06.993
came to Boston to find Hoyt.

39:07.028 --> 39:08.327
So they could kill together.

39:08.362 --> 39:10.262
That's what it looks like.

39:10.297 --> 39:13.732
Wait. Wait, no.

39:13.766 --> 39:15.625
If our apprentice was a soldier,

39:15.626 --> 39:18.803
we would've gotten a hit on
his fingerprints or his DNA

39:18.837 --> 39:20.037
in the military database.

39:20.072 --> 39:21.806
We didn't get a hit.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.975
You ever heard of
sheep dipping? No.

39:25.009 --> 39:27.210
It's when the CIA
borrows a soldier

39:27.244 --> 39:28.845
for a black-ops mission.

39:28.879 --> 39:30.379
Green berets were heep-dipped.

39:30.414 --> 39:32.473
Their identities were
wiped from all databases

39:32.474 --> 39:35.485
so they wouldn't be recognized
as American military.

39:37.289 --> 39:38.790
So you think our apprentice

39:39.449 --> 39:41.091
was a green beret
working for the CIA?

39:41.126 --> 39:43.494
Yes.

39:46.997 --> 39:48.797
So we train our best
men to be killers,

39:48.832 --> 39:50.732
and then we're surprised
when they are.

39:50.767 --> 39:53.034
I hate that he's a soldier.

39:56.411 --> 39:58.362
No, that's it.

39:58.891 --> 40:00.897
That's the connection. What?

40:00.898 --> 40:02.341
You wouldn't know it 'cause
it wasn't in the file.

40:02.375 --> 40:04.710
Hoyt used an assumed
name to get into

40:04.744 --> 40:07.311
a combat medic training
program at Fort Stewart.

40:07.346 --> 40:09.580
That has to be where
they met, right?

40:10.155 --> 40:11.623
Yeah, that's worth a shot.

40:11.624 --> 40:13.067
Let's fly to Fort Stewart in the morning.

40:13.068 --> 40:14.644
And... and cross-reference
Hoyt's records.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.473
We'll nail both these
sons of bitches.

40:22.379 --> 40:25.614
Uh, did you eat dinner?

40:27.050 --> 40:29.251
I can't remember.

40:29.988 --> 40:34.121
Well, are you hungry... for food?

40:35.978 --> 40:37.431
Agent Dean?

40:38.112 --> 40:39.312
Excuse me.

40:39.346 --> 40:40.913
Yeah.

40:48.558 --> 40:49.827
What is it, Maura?

40:49.861 --> 40:51.695
Jane...

40:51.729 --> 40:54.097
I'm in your apartment.

40:54.098 --> 40:54.585
Why?

40:56.883 --> 40:58.092
I'll be right there.

41:19.763 --> 41:20.929
Yeah?

41:20.964 --> 41:22.364
Jane, you were right.

41:22.398 --> 41:23.399
Called in a favor,

41:23.433 --> 41:25.534
got some records
from Fort Stewart.

41:25.569 --> 41:29.272
Our apprentice is special
forces officer John Stark, 32.

41:29.306 --> 41:30.940
He did three tours in Afghanistan

41:30.974 --> 41:32.608
as part of a direct action force.

41:32.642 --> 41:34.909
What unit was he assigned to?

41:34.944 --> 41:37.478
618, medical care specialists.

41:37.512 --> 41:40.380
Oh, my God, that's
the same as Hoyt.

41:40.414 --> 41:42.381
Stark lives at 400 Chestnut Hill Square.

41:42.415 --> 41:43.782
I'm already sending units.

41:43.817 --> 41:46.652
Okay. Uh, I'll get
there as soon as I can.

41:46.686 --> 41:48.120
Detective Rizzoli. Yeah.

41:48.154 --> 41:50.722
Dr. Isles asked if
you'd I.D. the body.

41:50.757 --> 41:52.090
What body?

41:52.124 --> 41:53.558
Sorry, thought you knew.

41:53.592 --> 41:55.060
Dr. Isles said it
was your neighbor...

41:55.094 --> 41:57.430
young female, 20s.

41:57.464 --> 41:59.331
Marisa?

41:59.366 --> 42:02.133
Oh, God, no.

42:02.168 --> 42:04.602
No, come on. No, no.

42:08.573 --> 42:10.941
Hello, Jane.

42:14.078 --> 42:15.645
So nice to see you.

42:45.270 --> 42:47.271
You looking for this?

42:49.073 --> 42:53.276
You know, your problem...

42:53.310 --> 42:56.880
Is that your heart...

42:56.914 --> 42:59.882
Rules your head.

43:10.592 --> 43:12.159
Where's your little helper?

43:12.193 --> 43:14.628
He's getting ready
for our final game.

43:14.662 --> 43:18.831
And I'm so happy to finish...

43:18.866 --> 43:20.933
What we started.

43:30.440 --> 43:31.640
Come take a look.

44:19.779 --> 44:23.214
Oh, Jane.

44:24.516 --> 44:28.285
Did you miss me?

44:32.590 --> 44:33.823
What the...

44:34.992 --> 44:36.425
Mnh! Ugh!

44:57.681 --> 44:59.381
Dr. Hoyt?

45:02.586 --> 45:05.989
Come on. Charge.

45:06.023 --> 45:06.991
Charge.

45:07.025 --> 45:08.526
Dr. Hoyt?

45:08.560 --> 45:10.728
Dr. Hoyt?

45:15.667 --> 45:17.234
Dr. Hoyt.

45:17.269 --> 45:18.736
Ugh!

46:28.696 --> 46:29.962
We match.

46:59.777 --> 47:01.408
Hey.

47:07.380 --> 47:09.246
Heard you got second-degree burns.

47:09.281 --> 47:11.682
Yeah, flares are h-hot.

47:18.422 --> 47:21.691
Stark was a decorated soldier.

47:21.725 --> 47:25.328
Makes me sick.

47:28.465 --> 47:31.402
Hoyt kills three people

47:31.436 --> 47:35.605
so Stark can waltz in and
hide him in a body bag.

47:40.944 --> 47:43.045
You got to be hungry now.

47:45.648 --> 47:47.315
So...

47:52.421 --> 47:54.755
I just want to go home.

47:54.789 --> 47:56.123
Yeah.

47:57.958 --> 47:59.893
Okay.

48:02.697 --> 48:04.698
I'll see ya. Yeah.

48:10.139 --> 48:12.040
Thank you, though.

48:14.643 --> 48:15.876
Sure.

48:51.106 --> 48:52.139
Hey.

48:52.173 --> 48:53.373
Hey.

48:53.408 --> 48:56.743
I wanted you to see for yourself

48:56.777 --> 48:59.378
what extraordinary
creatures these are.

48:59.413 --> 49:02.180
Uh...Thanks.

49:02.214 --> 49:04.581
I thought you might need
some help cleaning up.

49:04.616 --> 49:08.383
Yeah.

49:12.721 --> 49:15.589
All right, um...

49:15.623 --> 49:18.524
Let me get you some work clothes.

49:18.559 --> 49:20.192
These are my work clothes.

49:22.928 --> 49:25.529
What? You don't like?

49:28.498 --> 49:30.465
Well, they are kind of
cute when they're small.

49:30.500 --> 49:32.333
I told you.

49:32.368 --> 49:35.703
So, where do you want me to start?

49:39.140 --> 49:41.974
Come on.

49:42.008 --> 49:44.876
What? Let's go get a bloody Mary.

49:44.911 --> 49:46.745
We always said that we
need to do something

49:46.779 --> 49:49.079
outside of a crime scene.

49:49.114 --> 49:51.247
This is a crime scene.

49:51.282 --> 49:53.250
Let's go.

49:53.285 --> 49:55.286
Great.

49:58.757 --> 50:00.790
Uh, but...

50:00.824 --> 50:02.557
Dressed like that?

50:02.591 --> 50:05.256
These are my going-out clothes.

50:10.623 --> 50:12.823
Come on.

50:15.060 --> 50:17.128
Keep going. Go on, go on.
