WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:02.390
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.469 --> 00:05.961
I'm chaperoning at the prom.
They still need a couple of parents.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.906
You're asking me to the prom?

00:07.974 --> 00:10.306
You made fun of my mom's death, Brooke.

00:10.943 --> 00:13.071
It hurt. It did.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.511
Not anymore,
'cause you and me, we're done.

00:15.782 --> 00:16.908
She's dead.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.848
As far as I'm concerned, so are you.

00:18.985 --> 00:20.145
Peyton...

00:20.387 --> 00:21.854
Your boot's off.

00:22.288 --> 00:23.448
You can walk on it?

00:23.523 --> 00:25.491
Yeah, even better, I'm gonna dance on it.

00:25.992 --> 00:27.983
I'm coming back later
and I'm picking you up.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.820
<i>And if you open that door, I know</i>
<i>that you're gonna look beautiful.</i>

00:32.198 --> 00:34.359
And if not, I guess I'm going alone.

00:35.502 --> 00:36.560
Lucas.

00:38.471 --> 00:39.836
Hi, Peyton.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.769 --> 01:11.464
I guess I have my answer.

01:18.711 --> 01:20.804
I can't believe he actually left.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.083
I would never give up on you that easily.

01:25.151 --> 01:26.641
You hear me?

01:26.719 --> 01:28.311
Our love is forever.

01:51.511 --> 01:54.002
So, when you took your boot off,
was it all...

01:54.114 --> 01:56.207
Oh, it was like <i>Teen Wolf.</i>

01:56.416 --> 01:58.281
Seriously, I had to use three razor blades.

01:58.485 --> 01:59.713
Nice.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.181
I'm proud of you, Hales.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.356
My girl went strong
to be rehabbed by prom.

02:08.761 --> 02:09.818
Yeah.

02:09.895 --> 02:12.262
Well, at least everything'll be
perfect tonight.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.566
Oh, we gotta stop saying that.

02:30.216 --> 02:34.152
When have the chaperones been prettier
than the prom queens?

02:34.621 --> 02:36.589
Thanks, but I'm with someone.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.087
Hi, Whitey.

02:39.425 --> 02:41.359
- You look handsome.
- Thank you.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.526
Well, I better go see
if Principal Turner needs anything.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.192
What the hell are you doing?

02:49.435 --> 02:52.165
I'm making the rest of you guys look bad.

02:53.072 --> 02:56.200
Years ago, I watched you screw up
Karen's life.

02:56.809 --> 02:59.437
I'm not gonna allow
history to repeat itself.

02:59.679 --> 03:03.240
And yet you've been trying to make
that tux work since the '70s.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.777
I'll be watching you, Danny.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.456
I think... I think the fan belt snapped.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.657
Maybe it's the... The thingamajig.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.125
Can I please call Lucas now?

03:22.001 --> 03:23.093
Yeah.

03:25.738 --> 03:29.640
- I have no signal.
- Oh, great.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.973
Well, there's a convenience store
about a mile up ahead.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.844
I'll just walk there and call for a ride,
I guess. You can stay.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.041
No, thank you.

03:37.116 --> 03:39.277
A pregnant girl in a prom dress
with a broken-down car

03:39.352 --> 03:41.786
is how urban legends get started.
I'm coming with you.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.287
What about your leg?

03:43.356 --> 03:45.256
Lt'll be a good test. Come on.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.364
This is the final boarding call
for flight 121,

04:00.540 --> 04:02.599
service to New Orleans.

04:25.031 --> 04:27.431
Oh, good. Good.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.263
You're awake.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.600
I'm sorry about the sedative,

04:34.674 --> 04:37.905
but there were just so many
last-minute details.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.311
I missed you, Peyton. So much.

04:49.522 --> 04:52.719
Oh, God. I missed that smell!

04:58.431 --> 05:00.399
You're probably wondering

05:01.034 --> 05:03.127
how I got out of jail.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.134
"Miss Sawyer.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.435
"Detective Wilcox here.

05:11.477 --> 05:15.538
"We're just calling to let you know
we have your stalker in custody."

05:24.590 --> 05:25.818
Yeah?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.689
You know, I've had a lot of time
to think about

05:30.763 --> 05:33.561
what went wrong with us last time.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.592
A girl like you needs romance.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.563
Get that now.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.910
So, that's why
you and I are gonna have our own

05:49.882 --> 05:51.543
private prom.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.920
Just

06:00.727 --> 06:02.627
the two of us.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.045
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:55.114 --> 06:58.948
I'm so sorry to hear about your dress.
I had no idea.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.248
It's... It's okay. I got most of it off.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.447
Now when you black light me,
it just says "hoe."

07:03.523 --> 07:04.547
Oh.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.751
So where is she anyway?

07:06.826 --> 07:10.284
I went over to her house to pick her up
and she wouldn't even open the door.

07:10.863 --> 07:13.354
I guess she's not coming.

07:23.342 --> 07:26.175
Hey, I need to leave
for a little while.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.903
Sure. Where are we going?

07:32.318 --> 07:34.878
All right. Take it easy on the turns.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.047
My Grandpa Mel loosened the suspension.

07:37.223 --> 07:38.247
Okay.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.428
Hey, I'll be back in time for my coronation.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.861
Aren't they still voting for prom queen?

07:45.932 --> 07:48.833
Yeah, but it's really just a formality.

07:57.710 --> 08:02.044
You know, the hardest part
about the night we broke up,

08:02.849 --> 08:04.908
it wasn't your betrayal.

08:06.419 --> 08:09.513
It wasn't even falling out
of a second-story window.

08:10.289 --> 08:11.313
No.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.125
The hardest part

08:16.195 --> 08:18.390
was losing my photos.

08:20.299 --> 08:22.597
And now I have to start all over.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.437
Smile, Peyton.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.815
Thanks for picking us up, Mom.

08:42.388 --> 08:45.357
And just think, I couldn't have done this
a month ago.

08:45.591 --> 08:50.153
Well, maybe I just would've spent
a lot more time on the sidewalk.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.490
Pretend I'm not here.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.857
Sorry.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.802
This isn't exactly how I wanted
to start our romantic prom night.

08:58.871 --> 08:59.997
That's okay.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.666
You know, after everything we've been
through in the past year,

09:02.742 --> 09:05.210
your mom taking us to prom
feels pretty good.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.441
- Kind of like we're kids again?
- Yeah. Like, you know,

09:08.514 --> 09:10.539
maybe tonight we don't have to be
married and pregnant.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.777
We can just be teenagers.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.182
In that case, what's your curfew?

09:49.055 --> 09:50.420
Lucas!

09:52.491 --> 09:55.483
<i>You've reached Peyton's voicemail.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

09:55.928 --> 09:58.192
Hey, Peyton, this isn't right.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.223
You're the one I wanna be with tonight,
prom or not.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.260
So call me, okay?

10:05.605 --> 10:06.663
Please.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.507
Miss Gatina, you're no longer allowed
on school grounds.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.813
What are you gonna do, expel me?

10:20.753 --> 10:22.653
Don't make me call the police.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.248
Fine.

10:27.026 --> 10:29.688
All right,
I've got a limo and a fully stocked minibar.

10:29.762 --> 10:30.956
Who's with me?

10:36.902 --> 10:38.460
This school sucks.

10:40.506 --> 10:41.837
Rachel, wait.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.306
I'm coming with you.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.240
What about Brooke?

10:47.313 --> 10:51.443
If she were here, she'd do the same thing.
That's what friends do.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.648
See you, Turner.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.686
Oh.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.923
Expect a call from my lawyer
about the sexual harassment.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.027
She's kidding.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.725
Relax, Turner.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.257
You need a drink.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.238
In fact, I confiscated this flask
off one of your students.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.917
Give me a minute, Karen?

11:42.234 --> 11:43.826
It's time for our first dance.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.170
This song is special.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.673
I made it from your podcasts.

11:55.147 --> 11:58.605
I hope you see now
how much thought I put into tonight.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.585
That's why I couldn't have
you going to prom with Lucas.

12:05.291 --> 12:09.455
And afterwards, giving yourself to him.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.620
I couldn't allow that, Peyton.

12:13.432 --> 12:14.899
You belong to me.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.197
Oh, you're gonna have the perfect prom.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.598
Afterwards, we're gonna go up
to your bedroom

12:24.243 --> 12:26.336
and have the perfect prom night.

12:54.673 --> 12:57.801
Wow, another text from Lucas.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.110
Let's see what it says.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.241
"I'm so sorry.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.008
"Please talk to me.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.380
"Prom sucks without you."

13:09.488 --> 13:10.921
Let's reply.

13:10.990 --> 13:14.448
"Sorry. Running late.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.691
"Wait for me.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.288
"Hugs and kisses."

13:22.301 --> 13:24.360
Is that emoticon too much, you think?

13:24.737 --> 13:25.999
Oh, what the hell.

13:26.071 --> 13:29.734
"Semi-colon, close parenthesis."

13:41.187 --> 13:44.987
- Hey. Glenda, you look great!
- Thank you!

13:45.324 --> 13:47.758
So, I guess I'm not the only one alone
at prom.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.187
Maybe Lucas Scott really is
a Goth at heart.

13:50.296 --> 13:52.560
Peyton's on her way. Finally.

13:53.098 --> 13:56.659
But, you know, I could use company
until she gets here.

13:57.203 --> 14:00.639
Good, 'cause I could use someone to help
me pretend I'm above all this prom stuff.

14:00.973 --> 14:01.997
Okay.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.200
Hey, good news.

14:05.277 --> 14:08.178
Nobody's using the "DW not l" car tonight,
so it's all ours.

14:08.247 --> 14:09.271
Sweet!

14:09.348 --> 14:10.679
You ready to dance?

14:10.749 --> 14:12.341
- Definitely.
- All right.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.580
Definitely not.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.015
- I think I failed the test.
- Okay. Sit down.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.455
- That's all right.
- No. It's not okay.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.288
Aren't you the guy that always said
that at some point,

14:21.360 --> 14:22.554
you just got to deal with the pain?

14:22.628 --> 14:25.119
Yeah, well, I'm an idiot.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.755
Let me get you some punch, okay?

14:35.074 --> 14:36.905
- Here.
- Thank you.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.147
Oh, honey. That ain't punch.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.715
Not bad, huh?

14:43.782 --> 14:47.809
Yeah, they shanghaied my flask when I
came in, then I went to plan B, so it's all...

14:47.887 --> 14:49.286
- You spiked the punch?
- Dude!

14:49.355 --> 14:50.617
- Come here!
- It's prom!

14:50.689 --> 14:54.625
- My wife's pregnant, you idiot.
- Dude, it's prom!

15:01.867 --> 15:03.198
Dude.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.461
It's prom.

15:31.897 --> 15:34.229
Hey, you see that guy over there?

15:34.300 --> 15:38.430
He's got a key to a room at the
Holiday Inn and a box of wine cooling

15:38.504 --> 15:40.267
in the mini-fridge.

15:40.539 --> 15:41.597
You do this a lot?

15:41.740 --> 15:44.641
Helps kill time when you live
on the sidelines.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.477
Okay, it's your turn.

15:53.452 --> 15:57.548
She's wondering if she should forgive
the guy for being an ass

15:57.623 --> 15:59.386
for the last seventeen years.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.187
- Your mom, right?
- Yeah.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.329
And Daddy.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.609
Come on, Peyton.
Your car's in the driveway.

16:20.679 --> 16:21.976
I know you're home.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.125
Okay, Peyton.

17:09.627 --> 17:12.153
Your curling iron's still on,
so if you're trying to make it look

17:12.263 --> 17:15.358
like you're not here,
at least make it convincing.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.694
Great.

17:20.638 --> 17:23.540
Hide in your creepy basement
because you know I hate it.

17:23.942 --> 17:25.102
Too bad.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.339
I'm coming down anyway.

17:39.358 --> 17:40.757
Oh, my God.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.363
Well, well. Brooke Davis.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.922
One kiss wasn't enough
so you came back for seconds?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.467
Get off me!

17:52.237 --> 17:53.226
Brooke!

17:58.577 --> 18:00.704
What happened?
I thought you were leaving tonight.

18:01.113 --> 18:03.445
My flight got delayed by a few hours.

18:03.782 --> 18:05.511
Just enough time to crash prom.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.485
Well, we'll hang out and then
I'll take you back to the airport.

18:08.754 --> 18:12.656
- You sure? I mean, it's your prom night.
- Yeah, but it's your last night.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.787
Besides, prom just makes me
think about Shelly.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.088
All right, Mouth. Talk to me.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.833
I can't stop thinking about her.

18:24.236 --> 18:26.568
Her eyes. Her smile. Those...

18:27.139 --> 18:29.505
Those little freckles on the small
of her back.

18:30.175 --> 18:33.338
Hang on.
The small of her back?

18:33.879 --> 18:35.540
The Clean Teen gave it up.

18:36.014 --> 18:37.276
Nice work!

18:37.483 --> 18:40.077
Yeah, so nice she never wants to see
me again.

18:40.385 --> 18:42.512
Well, welcome to the rest of your life.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.688
Sex changes everything.

18:46.358 --> 18:47.950
You know what?
Let's not talk about Shelly.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.891
This is your night. What do you wanna do?

18:49.962 --> 18:54.456
Well, I wanted to deflower you,
but I guess I'm too late for that.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.895
I wanna do what you wanna do.

18:57.236 --> 18:58.601
I wanna get Shelly back.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.001
Except that.

19:00.405 --> 19:01.770
Shelly is nuts.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.809
And this is coming from a girl
who has seen a lot of nuts.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.075
I know. But...

19:08.413 --> 19:10.813
She made me feel dangerous, you know?

19:11.550 --> 19:13.643
Like... Like I was more than myself.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.653
Mouth, quit talking about Shelly.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.712
- Yeah, I'm boring you.
- No.

19:18.557 --> 19:20.991
You're making me jealous.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.531
So, when do I get the next chapter
of your book?

19:28.600 --> 19:31.831
Or is that your strategy,
get me hooked and leave me hanging?

19:31.937 --> 19:33.302
No, that's not it.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.599
The truth is, I'm stuck

19:35.941 --> 19:37.636
on the day my Uncle Keith died.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.838
I'm sure it's hard to revisit that day.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.848
But telling the truth about it
could help a lot of people.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.312
Maybe even you.

19:46.418 --> 19:48.477
See, that's just it.

19:49.054 --> 19:51.147
I have trouble with the details.

19:51.490 --> 19:54.357
And there's a lot of things
about that day I can't remember.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.490
Kind of like I blocked it out.

19:58.564 --> 19:59.861
I'll tell you what.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.994
Why don't you walk me through
the things you can remember?

20:03.101 --> 20:05.365
Maybe it'll help to talk it through.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.097
All right.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.845
It's a good thing I brought extra rope.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.949
Untie me, you freak!

20:19.318 --> 20:21.309
Figures you'd be good with your mouth.

20:25.657 --> 20:26.749
Hey.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.418
No one is gonna hear you.

20:31.196 --> 20:33.528
- Help!
- Help!

20:33.599 --> 20:36.762
- Help!
- Help!

20:36.835 --> 20:38.860
- Help!
- Help!

20:38.971 --> 20:40.836
- Help!
- Help!

20:40.906 --> 20:42.100
You know, Peyton?

20:42.174 --> 20:45.473
You really shouldn't play
your music so loud!

20:45.544 --> 20:48.035
- Help!
- Help!

20:48.280 --> 20:50.180
- Help!
- Help!

20:50.249 --> 20:52.080
Please, can you hear me?

20:52.150 --> 20:54.675
Help!

21:16.708 --> 21:18.369
This is the weirdest prom ever.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.842
No Peyton, no Brooke, no Lucas,

21:19.911 --> 21:21.572
- no Mouth...
- No Rachel.

21:22.481 --> 21:23.709
Good prom.

21:24.149 --> 21:27.141
Nathan, I need you
to drive a student home.

21:27.419 --> 21:30.820
- What do you mean?
- You have the "DW not l" car, don't you?

21:30.889 --> 21:34.086
Yeah, I guess I do.
Who is it?

21:45.437 --> 21:47.302
Why'd you come?

21:48.607 --> 21:52.008
We've been talking about senior prom
since we were eight.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.373
I knew something was wrong.

21:54.913 --> 21:58.178
- So you told someone you were coming?
- No.

21:59.451 --> 22:02.011
- At least I came.
- You should've told somebody.

22:02.087 --> 22:04.453
That is your problem.
You are so ungrateful.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.617
- You're an idiot!
- Don't call me an idiot, bitch.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.354
I hope he kills you first.

22:09.461 --> 22:10.951
That's a good idea.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.963
I know how much you hate her, Peyton.

22:18.303 --> 22:20.999
I was outside today. Watching.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.871
I heard you tell Brooke
that she was dead to you.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.915
Now I'm gonna make it official!

22:36.555 --> 22:39.353
- Derek, wait.
- Why don't you see, Peyton?

22:39.491 --> 22:43.757
I've been searching for some way
to show you how much I love you.

22:44.296 --> 22:47.857
I'm gonna hurt her as much
as she hurt you.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.301
Derek. Hey, hey. Look at me.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.872
If you really, really love me,

22:56.742 --> 22:58.232
let me do it.

23:00.779 --> 23:05.375
This is my chance for revenge. You,
more than anybody, should know that.

23:06.418 --> 23:09.444
Look, you were right about me, okay? Hey.

23:10.155 --> 23:11.782
You were right.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.020
We are so much alike.

23:15.026 --> 23:17.654
I have all the same feelings that you do.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.856
I have all the same desires.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.258
I don't believe you.

23:23.335 --> 23:24.666
It's true.

23:25.704 --> 23:28.298
Hey. I just couldn't admit it before.

23:29.474 --> 23:32.534
I'm gonna prove it to you now, okay?
Just untie me.

23:35.046 --> 23:36.638
You're lying.

23:38.049 --> 23:39.414
Come on, Derek.

23:40.318 --> 23:41.546
You've got the knife.

23:41.987 --> 23:43.921
And I'm half your size.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.015
Hey, baby.

24:07.846 --> 24:10.280
You better not be lying, Peyton.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.073
I'm not, baby.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.082
I promise.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.295
God! That felt good!

24:32.671 --> 24:34.070
Do it again.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.040
Why don't you make it hurt
next time, bitch?

24:44.783 --> 24:46.512
All right, give me the knife.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.685
I'm gonna finish this bitch off.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.155
Give me the knife!

24:53.391 --> 24:55.325
I don't think I can trust you.

24:56.962 --> 24:58.930
Let's talk about trust, okay?

24:58.997 --> 25:02.330
See, you lied to me.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.292
You said you were my brother, didn't you?

25:05.804 --> 25:08.034
You went about everything
all wrong, Derek.

25:08.807 --> 25:13.471
My God, you're...
You're such a beautiful boy.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.607
All you had to do was ask.

25:25.056 --> 25:26.751
Now how about you give me the knife?

25:27.459 --> 25:31.088
And then when I'm finished with her,
we'll go upstairs, okay?

25:31.663 --> 25:32.687
Okay?

25:33.431 --> 25:34.693
Come here.

25:43.141 --> 25:45.234
You wanna cut vertically.

25:46.978 --> 25:48.377
It's counterintuitive.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.473
I know.

25:53.785 --> 25:56.686
All those times you said
I was a backstabbing bitch,

25:57.322 --> 25:59.790
you had no idea how right you were.

26:07.933 --> 26:11.994
- God, did you have to hit me so hard?
- I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

26:12.737 --> 26:14.705
Peyton, Peyton, he's moving!

26:14.773 --> 26:16.570
Just get out of here!

26:16.775 --> 26:18.436
No! I'm not leaving you!

26:19.110 --> 26:22.079
That was so disappointing.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.644
You know what?

26:25.984 --> 26:27.849
I changed my mind.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.379
I think I'll kill you first.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.425
Peyton, run!

26:37.896 --> 26:39.591
Yeah, Peyton.

26:39.698 --> 26:40.960
Run!

26:50.375 --> 26:54.106
You shouldn't lie, Peyton.
It's not very nice!

27:04.389 --> 27:07.449
So this is where Peyton and I hid
on the day of the shooting.

27:09.427 --> 27:11.190
She told me she loved me.

27:12.897 --> 27:15.957
I just figured it was because she lost
a lot of blood.

27:16.901 --> 27:18.960
But on some level, I knew it was true.

27:21.039 --> 27:25.271
I was just too afraid to admit it
because it would hurt Brooke.

27:28.279 --> 27:31.908
You ever think maybe that's why
you have trouble writing about that day?

27:32.917 --> 27:37.047
Maybe you blocked things out
because you're afraid if you face the truth,

27:37.188 --> 27:39.952
it could hurt the other people you love?

27:45.296 --> 27:47.696
So I heard about you and Brooke Davis.

27:47.799 --> 27:49.426
High five!

27:50.568 --> 27:53.765
Well, I guess that means you guys
have, like, an open marriage?

27:53.938 --> 27:55.303
That is so great.

27:55.807 --> 27:57.104
- Out.
- But...

27:57.175 --> 27:59.405
- But my house is a like a mile...
- Out.

27:59.611 --> 28:02.341
All right, cool.
I'll see you guys Monday.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.213
You still wanna be a teenager?

28:11.289 --> 28:12.847
Oh, my gosh!

28:14.025 --> 28:17.893
You know, I used to dream about
how wonderful senior prom would be.

28:17.996 --> 28:20.430
Last great party with all of my friends
before we graduate.

28:20.498 --> 28:21.522
This night,

28:22.734 --> 28:24.827
- this is nothing like I predicted.
- Yeah.

28:24.903 --> 28:27.633
Well, you gotta be careful
about your predictions.

28:30.575 --> 28:31.803
Baby, school's back that way.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.741
- Where we going?
- It's a surprise.

28:33.812 --> 28:36.280
Oh. Okay.

29:08.279 --> 29:10.406
Open the door, Peyton!

29:12.283 --> 29:14.945
You already know I can break it down.

29:35.540 --> 29:36.939
You forgot to lock it.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.176
I didn't forget.

29:40.745 --> 29:43.339
Doesn't feel too good, does it?

29:44.215 --> 29:46.376
Not gonna run from you anymore, Derek!

29:46.451 --> 29:49.215
I'm not gonna run anymore period.
Now get up!

30:04.502 --> 30:06.470
- You've been training.
- That's right.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.028
With my real brother.

30:08.106 --> 30:10.074
He taught me this.

30:16.915 --> 30:19.577
Now that is for making me afraid
to sleep at night,

30:19.684 --> 30:22.380
you creepy, hair-smelling, son of a bitch!

30:36.534 --> 30:38.331
Did you really think

30:39.070 --> 30:40.628
you could beat me?

30:41.639 --> 30:43.300
A girl, huh?

30:43.441 --> 30:45.636
How about two girls?

30:53.418 --> 30:55.852
- Peyton, what do I do?
- Just kick him!

30:56.421 --> 30:59.015
Brooke, kick him!

31:28.086 --> 31:30.884
Peyton, eighth-grade cheer camp.

31:45.503 --> 31:47.630
I hated the bottom of that pyramid.

31:47.705 --> 31:50.071
Yeah, I know.
You bitched about it all summer.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.975
Peyton, be careful. He's gonna lunge.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.310
They always lunge.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.989
- I'm gonna call 911.
- Brooke, wait.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.124
Give me five minutes.

32:53.104 --> 32:55.265
Look, about earlier today...

32:56.774 --> 32:59.743
You were right. All those things
that I said about your mom...

32:59.811 --> 33:00.835
No.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.777
We both said a lot of things today.

33:04.716 --> 33:07.082
And besides, if you hadn't come right now,

33:07.151 --> 33:10.780
I'd be bitching to both my moms
about you in person.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.585
You saved me.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.020
You saved me, too.

33:21.366 --> 33:24.096
I guess now it's hoes over psychos.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.461
Yeah.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.776
So where do we go from here?

33:43.755 --> 33:45.052
Prom.

33:49.127 --> 33:50.389
Okay.

33:51.295 --> 33:54.458
<i>Flight 21 to Roanoke is now boarding</i>
<i>from Gate 2.</i>

33:54.532 --> 33:57.968
<i>Flight 21 to Roanoke is at Gate 2.</i>

33:59.737 --> 34:04.299
You know, I lied to you
when I told you my flight was delayed.

34:05.276 --> 34:08.938
The truth is,
I just wasn't ready to get on it.

34:09.647 --> 34:11.080
Why not?

34:12.483 --> 34:15.077
Because I wanted us to have
our last dance.

34:16.654 --> 34:18.143
Let's have it.

34:33.304 --> 34:36.000
You're gonna break a lot of hearts,
Mouth McFadden.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.310
So, what do you think?

34:47.385 --> 34:50.114
- Does this beat our prom?
- Well, let's see.

34:50.188 --> 34:51.712
The theme for our prom

34:51.789 --> 34:55.088
- was "Every Rose Has lts Thorn." Yeah.
- "Thorn." Right.

34:56.661 --> 34:58.094
That was also the night that I told you

34:58.162 --> 35:00.630
I was leaving to take
the basketball scholarship.

35:03.468 --> 35:06.028
I want you to know
that for the past seventeen years,

35:06.104 --> 35:08.800
I've been pretending
that that was the right choice.

35:09.207 --> 35:11.175
The last seventeen years,
I've been pretending

35:11.242 --> 35:13.233
that choice didn't break my heart.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.414
I wanna ask you something.

35:19.717 --> 35:23.278
Do you think it's impossible for you
to ever have feelings for me again?

35:23.354 --> 35:25.083
Like you once did?

35:27.024 --> 35:28.048
No.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.690
It's not impossible.

35:41.706 --> 35:43.435
What are we doing here?

35:43.508 --> 35:45.806
Well, do you remember
the last time we were up here?

35:45.877 --> 35:48.607
Yeah, I do.
It was when we were separated.

35:48.713 --> 35:50.510
I try to forget.

35:50.581 --> 35:53.209
Well, you showed me the predictions
that you and Lucas make

35:53.284 --> 35:56.276
every year on the first day of school. And...

35:56.354 --> 35:59.255
Well, I made a prediction of my own
that night, remember?

36:02.727 --> 36:04.126
There it is.

36:10.134 --> 36:12.898
"Haley and I will be together
again by graduation."

36:15.006 --> 36:17.065
Did you really believe that?

36:18.042 --> 36:23.742
I was in a pretty dark place back then,
but I never stopped believing in us.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.015
My prediction came true, Hales.

36:28.519 --> 36:32.546
And as far as I'm concerned,
that makes this a great night.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.051
So you think that leg's ready for a dance?

36:37.128 --> 36:40.359
Oh, I wish it were. But it's still a little stiff.

36:40.431 --> 36:42.661
- Sorry.
- Then we won't use it.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.828
Oh, well. It's my lucky night.

37:10.628 --> 37:15.895
<i>Attention. Now boarding Flight 243</i>
<i>to New Orleans at Gate 6.</i>

37:17.368 --> 37:18.392
That's me.

37:18.469 --> 37:22.405
<i>Attention. Now boarding Flight 243</i>
<i>to New Orleans at Gate 6.</i>

37:23.741 --> 37:25.936
Then I guess this is goodbye.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.606
I'm really glad you came back
tonight, Rachel.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.813
Me too.

37:40.591 --> 37:41.649
Hey,

37:42.927 --> 37:44.292
you wanna come with me?

37:46.497 --> 37:50.365
I can't. I'd miss finals and graduation.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.225
It's suicidal.

37:52.903 --> 37:53.961
No.

37:54.839 --> 37:56.602
It's just dangerous.

38:02.413 --> 38:03.641
It's okay, Mouth.

38:05.683 --> 38:06.980
See you later.

38:16.427 --> 38:17.724
Rachel, wait.

38:22.366 --> 38:23.663
I'm coming with you.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.279
So it's you.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.043
What do you mean?

39:16.120 --> 39:17.417
You lost your phone.

39:17.888 --> 39:19.856
- That's not my phone.
- You sure?

39:20.124 --> 39:21.148
Yeah.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.286
What's wrong with you?

39:23.894 --> 39:25.555
And where's my mom?

39:26.130 --> 39:27.154
She's...

39:28.432 --> 39:31.128
I'm sorry. I just...

39:31.435 --> 39:33.096
What are you doing here, Lucas?

39:34.805 --> 39:37.296
I guess I just keep feeling like...

39:38.642 --> 39:40.769
I keep feeling like Keith's
trying to tell me something.

39:40.845 --> 39:43.541
We already had this conversation, Son.

39:43.814 --> 39:45.076
- I know. But...
- No.

39:45.182 --> 39:48.049
Keith's dead. Okay? He's not coming back.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.843
Open your eyes.

39:52.656 --> 39:54.715
<i>Open your eyes, Luke.</i>

39:55.893 --> 39:57.554
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

40:01.899 --> 40:03.526
- Keith...
- Luke,

40:05.503 --> 40:07.937
I love you. Now go.

40:08.706 --> 40:09.764
Go.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.090
You ready for this, Brooke Davis?

40:28.726 --> 40:30.626
Welcome to prom, P. Sawyer.

40:42.373 --> 40:45.365
Attention, everyone!
Gather round the stage.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.344
It's time to announce our prom queen.

40:48.813 --> 40:50.678
The envelope, please.

40:51.582 --> 40:53.948
All right. And this year's prom queen,

40:55.486 --> 40:57.147
Brooke Davis!

41:56.413 --> 41:57.402
