- [Knocking]
- Yeah.

39:14.461 --> 39:19.422
- Agent Mulder.
- Sir, I didn't expectyou
back to work for a few weeks.

39:19.534 --> 39:24.061
I was looking forAgent Scully.
There was something I wanted
to talk to her about.

39:24.139 --> 39:26.869
Actually,
I wanted to talk toyou.

39:26.940 --> 39:28.965
I wanted to thankyou
for everything you did.

39:29.043 --> 39:31.012
You mean getting
shot in the gut ?

39:31.079 --> 39:34.514
You got shot becauseyou stood up
to these people.

39:34.581 --> 39:39.110
I thinkyou're proceeding from
a mistaken impression. What
I did I did because it's myjob.

39:39.186 --> 39:43.817
From what I understand,
you putyourjob and your life
on the line for Scully.

39:43.925 --> 39:47.485
This isn't my crusade, Agent Mulder.
A woman was murdered.

39:47.594 --> 39:50.791
I mistakenly thought
we could bring the man who
committed that crime tojustice.

39:50.864 --> 39:55.302
- What doyou mean, "mistakenly" ?
- That's what I need
to talk to Scully about.

41:04.838 --> 41:08.239
I wasjust thinking about something
that a man said to me.

41:12.213 --> 41:14.204
That the--

41:14.282 --> 41:17.445
That the dead speak to us
from beyond the grave.

41:19.554 --> 41:22.181
That that's
what conscience is.

41:24.425 --> 41:27.860
That's interesting.
I never thought ofit that way.

41:29.463 --> 41:31.489
You know, I thought...

41:32.900 --> 41:35.130
when we found him,

41:35.202 --> 41:38.695
this man that
killed Melissa, that--

41:38.773 --> 41:42.902
that when we brought him tojustice,
I would feel some kind ofclosure.

41:47.648 --> 41:50.344
But the truth is,
no court...

41:53.320 --> 41:56.778
no punishment,
is ever enough.

41:58.525 --> 42:01.518
I came here to
tell you something, Scully.

42:03.231 --> 42:06.496
There may be somejustice,
just not the kind you're looking for.

42:06.568 --> 42:08.695
What areyou
talking about ?

42:08.769 --> 42:12.900
They found this man, Luis Cardinal,
dead in his cell.

42:12.974 --> 42:15.498
- How ?
- They made it look like a suicide.

42:15.577 --> 42:19.012
The men he worked for
couldn't take the chance that
he'd point his finger at them.

42:21.148 --> 42:23.117
And what about Krycek ?

42:23.184 --> 42:25.981
Oh, he was there.
I know that.

42:26.054 --> 42:29.181
You think
they got to him too ?

42:29.257 --> 42:32.920
I don't know.
But ifthey haven't, theywill.

42:33.027 --> 42:35.688
I doubt it'll weigh on
their consciences, though.

42:36.965 --> 42:40.400
I think the dead are
speaking to us, Mulder,

42:40.467 --> 42:42.458
demandingjustice.

42:44.539 --> 42:48.065
Maybe that man
was right.

42:48.141 --> 42:51.009
Maybe we
bury the dead alive.
