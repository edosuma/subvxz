01:53.080 --> 01:56.720
For a hundred years,
there was chaos in our lands.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.720
War between Saxons and Dane invaders.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.680
And war between men
who wanted to be kings.

02:09.520 --> 02:14.200
My lord, Uhtred, son of Uhtred,
born a Saxon, but raised a Dane,

02:14.280 --> 02:16.920
had brought about a fragile peace.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.040
But as King Edward's health faltered,

02:23.160 --> 02:24.160
trouble spread.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.920
And while most of the country
was sworn to the Saxons,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.240
Uhtred's land of Northumbria was not.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.200
And enemies were keen to exploit this.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.840
Wolf!

03:08.280 --> 03:10.240
Wolf! [grunts] Wolf!

03:13.280 --> 03:16.760
Destroy the settlement.
Leave no sign we have landed.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.480
Ah!

03:34.400 --> 03:36.480
Anlaf, we have the spy.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.560
Behold my child.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.280
Behold the daughter of Anlaf.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.440
You look ridiculous.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.120
It is how they dress, Father.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.840
If I'm to hide amongst them,
I must appear--

03:55.920 --> 03:57.600
Is King Edward dead?

03:57.680 --> 03:58.720
Not yet.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.920
-But each breath could be his last.
-Then we chose our moment.

04:02.520 --> 04:06.080
A king dies,
Saxons always turn on each other.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.440
Pass this news to all kings who hate them.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.040
Tell them I have crossed from Irland
and wish to make allies.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.880
Return yourself to Winchester.

04:13.960 --> 04:14.960
Wait.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.240
Play with them.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.840
Unleash chaos.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.080
No. Stay back.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.720
Find the queen!

04:51.240 --> 04:52.680
Lady Eadgifu,

04:52.760 --> 04:57.680
the traitor Aelfweard has sent men to take
you and Prince Edmund into protection.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.560
I have no wish to be a hostage.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.360
-Can we fight them?
-Not without Aethelstan.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.760
Well, surely, my guards can--

05:08.840 --> 05:11.360
Loyalties are shifting
and factions forming.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.200
It is not certain who supports us.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.120
We should flee with your son
whilst we can.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.480
I will not forgive this.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.480
Nor forgive Aethelstan
for leaving us exposed.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.360
Damn him for his absence.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.200
Come, Edmund. We are leaving.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.840
- Where's the queen?
- Move! Look everywhere!

05:33.760 --> 05:35.840
- Mother, what's--
- Sh. Quiet.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.880
-Wait.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.120
- Pyrlig.
- We got word.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.840
Aethelstan has gone on pilgrimage
to pray for his father's health.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.040
Then find him and tell him of his death.

05:48.120 --> 05:51.160
Then strike him, from me,
for he swore to protect us.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.200
Come. There's no time.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.400
Where will you go?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.680
-To Uhtred.
-The pagan?

06:00.760 --> 06:02.680
- They're in here!
- Go! Go!

06:08.080 --> 06:10.000
Uhtred betrayed my husband.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.240
Are we sure this is wise?

06:12.320 --> 06:15.360
Uhtred was like a father to Aethelstan.
He can be trusted.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.640
We go to the last kingdom.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.600
He stood in front of the army,
and he said, "Release the arrows!"

06:38.680 --> 06:40.840
And an arrow went right through his head.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.080
Oh, that was something.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.440
But then, the battle for this place
certainly sticks in the memory.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.000
-Both times.
- Hey. Cnut.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.680
He was a proper… cock!

06:52.760 --> 06:55.840
Then there were the horse-killers.
Oh, they were deadly.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.440
-What was his name?
-Bloodhair.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.600
Bloodhair. And what was her name?
She of the curses?

07:00.680 --> 07:02.800
Do not remind me. [belches] Skade!

07:02.880 --> 07:04.800
Now, she was moon touched.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.880
Another one who thought she was a seer.
It didn't go well for her.

07:08.960 --> 07:13.160
I am telling you, my dream was a prophecy.
Three nights I have had it.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.880
-And what is your dream, Ingrith?
- Don't get her started, Lord.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.520
-Hear my words. "Seven kings must die."
- Lord?

07:20.600 --> 07:21.920
-Seven kings and--
-Ingrith!

07:30.760 --> 07:32.000
All stand for the queen!

07:38.320 --> 07:39.200
Queen Eadgifu.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.520
And my most noble friend, Lord Aldhelm.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.800
What brings you this far north?

07:50.760 --> 07:52.760
I come seeking refuge with my son.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.400
Edward, rightful king of these lands,
has died.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.720
Then my heart grieves.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.080
I'd hoped to reconcile.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.680
One down, six to go.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.440
No! I do not like it.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.040
Northumbria recognizes the new king,
Aethelstan.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.200
Do not assume Aethelstan will be king.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.480
-Who is supporting Aelfweard?
- The ealdormen of Wessex.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.920
Of course.
Still claiming Aethelstan's a bastard?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.120
Yes. Aelfweard has
the wealth of Wiltunscir behind him.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.720
Our spies in Aegelesburg say he's there,
openly recruiting mercenaries.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.440
We will go to Aegelesburg and seize him
before he is at full force.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.200
We would prefer your guard.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.880
My offer gives Aethelstan the time
to go to Winchester to be crowned,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.400
and we avoid a clash of armies.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.280
I swore an oath to protect Aethelstan--

08:50.360 --> 08:52.840
And of course, you are a man of your word.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.680
Yet your oath to swear your lands
to the king remains unfulfilled.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.440
Your husband showed himself
hostile to those of Danish blood.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.320
As such, he was not the right man
to unite England.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.240
If he had been, England would be united.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.240
But now things can be different.

09:08.320 --> 09:11.040
Aethelstan can be the king
to fulfill the Saxon dream.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.480
If he chooses to swear--

09:12.560 --> 09:15.360
I swore an oath of loyalty, and it stands.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.720
If Aelfweard is buying mercenaries,
he will be looking for men from all parts.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.120
Do you think
we can still execute an ambush?

09:26.200 --> 09:28.200
If it is for Aethelstan, then yes.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.360
-If he does not fall asleep.
-Once. I fell asleep once.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.920
Are you certain this is better
than a band of young fighters?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.160
I hear you do little these days
but feast and hunt.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.640
I will not send young men
to do a task I swore to do myself.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.240
- Come on, you little…

10:02.320 --> 10:03.600
Come on! Come on.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.680
- Stop it now.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.960
Osbert! What news from our borders?
Do the Scots behave themselves?

10:10.040 --> 10:13.000
Yes, Father. There are rumors
Wolf-Warriors landed near Derwent.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.680
-Wolf-Warriors?
-Why are you carrying your sword?

10:15.760 --> 10:18.240
We're riding
to protect Aethelstan from his brother.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.240
Then I will come.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.240
-Any fight of yours is mine.
-Stay here and protect your birthright.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.600
No good comes
of sitting waiting for a birthright.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.040
So you train the horses

10:26.120 --> 10:28.880
and you teach that boy
how to defend himself.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.440
No one likes the third son of a dead king.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.080
Father.

10:36.760 --> 10:40.760
-Will you swear our lands to Aethelstan?
-I must honor my word.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.120
Northumbrians will be sad
to lose their pagan lord.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.480
Gotcha!

10:50.520 --> 10:52.800
-Look at this little bastard.
-Are we ready?

10:52.880 --> 10:54.920
He's complaining
about his saddle.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.720
-Says his arse gets sore.
- Didn't say arse. I said my back.

10:57.800 --> 10:58.840
I made you this.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.240
And one for each of you.

11:03.320 --> 11:07.560
Men who sit on cold earth
find the cold earth calls for them.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.840
Once again, she shows herself a seer.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.880
Lord, it was nothing.

11:13.920 --> 11:14.800
Tell it again.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.120
"Seven kings must die," Lord.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.000
-"Seven kings--"
-Ingrith, no.

11:23.080 --> 11:23.920
Go on.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.600
"And the woman you love."

11:30.040 --> 11:31.920
I'm no king, and I have no woman.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.920
-It means nothing.
- Lord Uhtred.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.600
I told my son to train yours.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.560
While you are here,
take Wassa as your serving woman.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.480
-Make this fortress your home.
-I wish to say one thing of Aethelstan.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.240
He is not quite
the carefree boy you raised.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.600
He has grown very much into his faith.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.480
The Brotherhood of Oswald
exert great influence.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.880
I have scared off such men before.
For some reason, monks find me terrifying.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.800
- Let's go play kingmaker.
- Once again.

12:40.480 --> 12:43.400
My father?
No, that cannot be.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.680
I thought God had given him the winter.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.520
Lord Aethelstan, you should
make haste to Wessex for coronation.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.800
Your brother gathers men.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.160
Establish yourself at Winchester
before he raises an army.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.560
We will leave when God commands us
to leave, Father Pyrlig.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.760
And that command has not been given.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.480
Return when you have prayed.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.760
Do I depart?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.080
Only the book has answers.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.120
Play.

13:46.760 --> 13:52.400
You have been guided
to the Book of Matthew, verse 157.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.760
"Then Jesus went thence and departed
into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon."

14:08.080 --> 14:09.440
God wants you to fight.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.520
Oh. Thank you, lady.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.040
Halt. State your business here.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.440
We heard a man is looking for fighters.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.680
We come to make some coin.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.040
Mm.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.360
Go on.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.840
-This place has fallen to shit.
- Edward left it to decline.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.160
I'm glad Aethelflaed
is not here to see it.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.320
Huh.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.840
Word has spread.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.160
I swear
I've fought half these men.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.200
This is not someone
trying to recruit.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.840
This is preparing for a battle.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.520
That is the youth Aelfweard.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.160
Go see what men know of his plans.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.440
I'll show you a sword!

15:30.520 --> 15:31.600
Oh!

15:31.680 --> 15:32.720
Ooh.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.120
-Is that amber in your sword?
-How much do you want for it?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.600
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.400
- Go home to your mothers.
- Edgar! No.

15:53.680 --> 15:54.600
Wilfrid!

15:55.200 --> 15:56.040
Wilfrid!

15:57.440 --> 15:58.680
Do you speak to me, friend?

15:59.840 --> 16:01.880
Your pardon. I thought you were Wilfrid.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.840
A great man I fought with at Tettenhall.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.120
Wait, you were at Tettenhall?

16:07.480 --> 16:08.680
My father was there.

16:10.040 --> 16:13.640
-Who do you fight for now?
-Aelf… something?

16:13.720 --> 16:17.320
-Saxon names are much alike.
-The Aelf who marches on Wessex?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.080
You haven't heard.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.320
No one's marching on Wessex.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.920
I'm told the new plan
is to lure Aethelstan here.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.040
Aethelstan is on his way.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.920
Aelfweard challenged him to battle,
and he's accepted.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.160
Why would he agree to that?

16:38.240 --> 16:39.960
Because he's young,
and they've baited him.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.120
They plan to snare him between the gate
and men hidden in the hills.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.880
Then we take control before he arrives.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.280
We can't seize this town
with just us, Lord.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.640
We do not need to seize the town.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.840
Hey! Can I tempt you
to play for money, friend?

17:27.840 --> 17:31.960
Tie them up and secure the bolt.
Stay low until Aethelstan arrives.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.280
If there's a bed, it's mine.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.480
He's here.

18:09.560 --> 18:13.160
Raise the alarm!
Soldiers approach the southern gate!

18:29.160 --> 18:33.120
Come no further!
Aegelesburg is loyal to me now.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.560
We do not negotiate with bastards.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.920
Nor do we surrender.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.080
-You'll have to starve us out.
-I am not foolish, brother.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.400
I assumed you would place a trap.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.520
Perhaps delay me here until your forces
could attack at rearguard.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.960
Show him what's left of his men!

18:58.240 --> 19:00.000
You can yield now,

19:00.080 --> 19:02.200
or we destroy the gate
and kill all your men.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.800
The gates will hold. No yield will come.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.760
Then you will be destroyed.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.160
Get ready to open the door.

19:08.240 --> 19:10.880
I am the rightful king.
Your mother was a whore.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.840
All good men know it. You have no allies.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.640
Lord Aelfweard.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.480
-I'm Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
-Uhtred.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.920
You know me
as a man who speaks the truth,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.800
so hear me when I say,
for the common good, stand down.

19:25.880 --> 19:29.520
My men control the gate.
You're outnumbered on all sides.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.480
Yield.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.040
Let this end with peace.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.320
Give yourself to me, brother.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.240
Then it is over.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.560
Forgive me for my failings,

20:01.400 --> 20:03.240
and give comfort to my mother's kin.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.200
Tell them of my exile

20:07.040 --> 20:10.160
and how we sought
to honor our discarded bloodline.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.960
-For Wessex!
- For Wessex!

20:16.960 --> 20:17.880
Lord Uhtred,

20:20.120 --> 20:21.120
open the gate.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.040
-No!
- God chose me rightful heir.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.640
Aethelstan!

21:11.640 --> 21:12.480
Advance!

21:14.080 --> 21:15.720
Leave no enemy alive!

21:25.920 --> 21:27.840
Lord, stop this madness!

21:29.080 --> 21:30.080
Stop!

21:34.360 --> 21:35.560
Aethelstan!

21:45.680 --> 21:47.120
Get back! Hide!

21:47.200 --> 21:49.560
- I submit! Please don't--

21:54.960 --> 21:56.000
Aethelstan!

21:57.760 --> 21:58.960
Please, show mercy!

22:00.080 --> 22:00.960
No!

22:04.400 --> 22:06.840
Stop! They're surrendering!

22:18.200 --> 22:19.360
Aethelstan!

22:22.080 --> 22:24.920
-Aethelsta--

22:44.320 --> 22:45.160
Ah!

22:46.000 --> 22:48.160
-Ah!

22:50.040 --> 22:51.800
Lord! Lord, help us!

22:54.400 --> 22:55.960
Aethelstan!

23:03.680 --> 23:04.840
Aethelstan!

23:06.160 --> 23:08.480
-Stand down your men.
- Uhtred, why are you here?

23:08.560 --> 23:11.480
To stop this.
Your enemy has surrendered.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.760
Halt your men.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.120
-Let him approach and call a halt.
- Yes, my lord.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.880
-What happened to you?

23:22.960 --> 23:26.280
-You had no need to kill your brother.
-I did, or in time, he would return.

23:26.360 --> 23:27.880
-You dishonored your word.
-I did not.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.440
I told him to yield.
I did not say he would survive.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.800
It was never our plan to let him live.
Lord, reverse the order.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.320
We are close to routing them.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.720
-Hired men have no quarrel with you.
-You were right not to seek his help.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.320
You kill 100 fathers,
you give 300 sons a reason to defy you.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.320
Think!

23:49.200 --> 23:50.760
Now's the time to unify.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.200
Uhtred may be right in this matter.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.560
I speak only as a man
who has made mistakes before.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.240
-I'm Uhtred of--
-I know who you are.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.120
Uhtred, this is Lord Ingilmundr.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.640
A great commander
and a great friend to me.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.160
Then a friend to me.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.400
Why the Danish name?

24:19.120 --> 24:21.160
Born to a Dane, but raised a Saxon.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.160
I found Christ
through the works of Alfred,

24:23.240 --> 24:25.840
and indeed through the writings
of your son in Rome.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.080
You must be proud of him.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.080
He is a true scholar.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.240
I'm just the fool who made him.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.320
Ingilmundr holds the garrison
at Thelwael on the Wirral.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.320
He knows many of the people
we knew from Rumcofa.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.400
Good people.
I should like to see them again.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.920
Yes. Perhaps after
you've sworn Northumbria to the new king.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.440
Honor your word.

24:46.520 --> 24:49.280
Swear to Aethelstan
what you denied his father.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.720
Cede your lands and make England whole.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.560
As you say,

24:57.480 --> 24:58.640
it is the time for unity.

25:06.160 --> 25:09.160
I will swear to a king,
and you are not yet crowned.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.640
Nor will I kneel to you covered in blood.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.360
I will renounce my lands
in the Great Hall at Winchester.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.920
-It doesn't need to be done with ceremony.
-But Uhtred is a man of his word.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.160
Come to Winchester.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.320
Heal the wound.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.400
How did he know
we were coming here?

25:29.480 --> 25:31.360
He's always found a way
to protect me.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.720
Perhaps he has friends
who keep one eye on you.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.040
My mother was the same.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.400
It's touching, how you still defer to him.

25:40.480 --> 25:43.960
-He's been steadfast a long time.
-And noble that you trust him.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.800
Given all that went on with your father.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.000
Which boy prevailed?

26:01.080 --> 26:03.160
Aethelstan.

26:03.760 --> 26:08.200
Killed his brother in cold blood
and will now claim the Saxon crown.

26:08.280 --> 26:12.120
Then it's settled.
Any word on renewal of the treaty?

26:14.680 --> 26:16.160
Push Winchester.

26:17.040 --> 26:20.600
-Make contact.
-Lord, we've had word of something else.

26:21.800 --> 26:25.280
-The Dane, Anlaf, seeks a meeting.
-The one who eats the flesh of men?

26:25.360 --> 26:30.200
An assembly with you, and the kings
of Man, Shetland, and Orkney.

26:30.800 --> 26:34.360
I will not be the lone Christian
lured to meet Dane kings.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.880
They might offer something of interest.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.320
Seek to renew a peace with Saxons.

26:43.040 --> 26:46.320
Edward kept the truce. We have no reason
to think his son will not.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.120
I'll send word.

26:52.680 --> 26:56.000
His own flesh, put to the knife.

26:58.080 --> 27:01.080
-He is more brutal than you suggested.
-His heart has hardened.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.040
Which should harden those against him.

27:03.560 --> 27:07.800
-Do other kings in Britain hear our call?
-They pretend to be deaf to us.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.400
-But I know they listen.
-They should.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.000
Aethelstan will become greedy.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.920
Mm.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.880
You would know ambition, Father.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.600
Eh, and when my lands are yours,
you will know it too.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.840
Return to Winchester.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.080
Watch everyone.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.960
And bring me word
when there's word to tell.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.920
- Father, have you been injured?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.520
-Nothing that will not heal.
- Tell me the news is wrong.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.960
-Did Aethelstan turn on his own blood?
- Yes.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.040
-Aelfweard did not survive.
-Then Edmund cannot return to Winchester.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.720
He will always be seen as a rival.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.080
Aethelstan has always shown
great affection for your son.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.400
But she is right.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.520
He has fallen under an influence.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.400
I shall not leave Bebbanburg
until the threat passes.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.720
-You're welcome here as long as you wish.
- And it will pass.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.560
The duties of kingship
will focus Aethelstan's mind.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.120
But I should return south.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.160
I will assess the mood.

28:22.320 --> 28:28.320
♪ Hallelujah ♪

28:28.880 --> 28:35.720
♪ Hallelujah ♪

28:35.800 --> 28:37.720
Almighty and everlasting God,

28:37.800 --> 28:41.480
pour out the spirit of thy grace
and blessing upon this, thy servant,

28:41.560 --> 28:42.680
King Aethelstan.

28:42.760 --> 28:46.520
That, as by the imposition of our hands,
he is this day crowned king.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.040
So he may, by thy sanctification,

28:50.120 --> 28:54.960
continue always thy chosen servant,
through Christ, our Lord.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.400
Grant him the faith of Abraham,

28:57.480 --> 28:58.920
the wisdom of Solomon,

28:59.560 --> 29:01.400
the courage of David.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.520
Vivat Rex!

29:06.040 --> 29:07.560
Vivat Rex!

29:07.640 --> 29:09.400
Vivat Rex!

29:09.480 --> 29:11.240
Vivat Rex!

29:11.320 --> 29:12.880
Vivat Rex!

29:12.960 --> 29:14.560
Vivat Rex!

29:14.640 --> 29:16.120
Vivat Rex!

29:16.800 --> 29:18.040
Vivat Rex!

29:29.400 --> 29:30.960
You were not there.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.960
This moment was all we had talked of.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.400
-And you were not there.
-No.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.120
I was here.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.000
The call of the scripture
always comes first.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.160
You believe that, don't you?

29:49.400 --> 29:50.640
Yes, yes, of course.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.920
Then you will be a great king of England.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.880
And all will speak of you
as they did Alfred.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.800
Does Uhtred stand by his word?

30:05.360 --> 30:07.160
No. Uhtred has not come.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.000
-Clearly, he--
-He wishes to remain king in his own land.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.760
May God protect him from his vanity.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.160
But towards you, it is a cruelty.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.400
And I am sorry. Here. Come. Come.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.520
What torture to enact on so kind a soul.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.760
-I thought you had both abandoned me.
-Of course I would not.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.320
I'm just surprised
Uhtred could be so foolish.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.520
You would've thought
his years would make him wiser.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.600
Perhaps he still sees
the boy you once were,

30:47.440 --> 30:49.480
and not the man you have become.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.720
Lord.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.520
It's not Serpent's Breath, but…

31:33.680 --> 31:38.680
it's lighter, it's sharper,
and it's got a garnet.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.280
Give it a name.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.560
Manslayer.

31:47.360 --> 31:48.240
Ball-taker.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.680
Uhtred, Sword of Uhtred.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.480
You actually smiled, Lord.

31:57.880 --> 32:01.480
Perhaps losing my sword
was a sign that my battle days are over.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.680
A bad time to provoke the king.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.040
I did not provoke him.

32:06.880 --> 32:10.000
I'm simply giving him time
to prove he's not a tyrant.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.920
-Otherwise…
-Otherwise what?

32:16.640 --> 32:18.680
"Seven kings must die." For what?

32:19.840 --> 32:22.080
-What did your wife see?
-She sees nothing.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.280
I swear.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.400
What do they celebrate?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.840
The breaking of the horses.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.480
Thank Osbert for the care
he has shown Edmund.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
He's part of Bebbanburg now.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.280
You both are.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.160
Yes, my son is quite changed.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.240
There was a somberness at the palace
that has lifted.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.160
It's the air here.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.120
Brings out good spirits in everyone.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.360
Hyah!

33:17.720 --> 33:19.840
You yourself seem happier.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.400
I am, Lord Uhtred.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.880
Some grief has passed, and I feel…

33:30.560 --> 33:32.040
more ready for the world.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.600
Control! Good!

33:43.520 --> 33:45.760
Forgive us these sins that we commit.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.480
Will we be forgiven?

33:50.000 --> 33:51.240
Our sin weighs heavy.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.200
Yes, it does.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.120
But remember,

34:01.400 --> 34:03.120
God holds us in the balance.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.280
Every sin can be weighed
against an act of faith.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.920
Grow the faith and the sin is diminished.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.600
What if the shadow of sin
obscures the faith?

34:23.720 --> 34:24.560
Come.

34:26.680 --> 34:29.920
Perhaps return
to your grandfather's vision for England.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.880
Perhaps now there is an urgency
to bring the pagans to light.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.000
Will that

34:39.120 --> 34:39.960
cleanse me?

34:40.920 --> 34:41.760
Us?

34:41.840 --> 34:45.280
Well, surely the greater the lands,
the greater the faith.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.360
Go beyond what Alfred dreamed of.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.240
Look to the islands God made,
not the countries ordained by men,

34:52.320 --> 34:54.520
and bring all to Christianity.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.160
So when you are judged,

34:56.920 --> 34:59.440
you will be found in balance.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.760
And thus may accept both the sin…

35:04.960 --> 35:06.640
and the conquest against it.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.040
Lord!

35:40.880 --> 35:41.720
Stop.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.200
What do you talk of?

35:48.200 --> 35:50.200
Oh my faith, Lady. I cannot lie.

35:50.720 --> 35:54.480
The ladies here care for Lord Uhtred
and wish keenly he would find a woman.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.320
Well, they shall be sore of heart.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.880
The widow of a king will not marry a lord.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.360
Hm.

36:06.600 --> 36:09.680
I shall have to be more careful
in how I conduct myself.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.680
It is not the gossips
you should fear, Lady.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.400
This peace may not sustain.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.200
Lord Uhtred has snubbed the king.

36:21.680 --> 36:25.440
The women Uhtred has affection for
become a target for his enemies.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.360
- Sihtric!
-Sh-sh.

36:32.520 --> 36:33.800
What have you learnt?

36:35.680 --> 36:37.520
Aethelstan has claimed Eoferwic.

36:38.360 --> 36:42.280
He says since Rognvaldr is dead,
there is no king, so it belongs to him.

36:42.800 --> 36:43.720
Eoferwic?

36:45.240 --> 36:48.240
They see me as their lord now.
Aethelstan knows this.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.080
He is demanding all come with tribute.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.720
Not just Saxon chiefs,
but all kings of Britain.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.480
All the mainland
and all the outlying islands.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.040
Lord?

36:59.200 --> 37:00.600
Declare yourself king here.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.560
Like your forebears.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.680
No. This is Aethelstan.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.120
If he chooses the wrong path,
I must tell him.

37:11.880 --> 37:12.720
Lord.

37:36.800 --> 37:40.560
"There went out a decree
that all the world should be taxed."

37:40.640 --> 37:44.200
You owe no tribute!
Return to your villages.

37:44.280 --> 37:48.320
-Uhtred! Calm yourself.
-Pyrlig? What is this tribute?

37:48.400 --> 37:52.240
He says it is to build churches,
but, please, there are spies everywhere.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.560
Tell your arseling apprentice
he's badly misjudged the mood of Scotland.

37:58.640 --> 37:59.880
You seem upset.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.640
We came to renew our treaty.

38:04.520 --> 38:09.920
Instead, we've been left waiting for days,
only to be told we are supplicants.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.240
I would be careful.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.280
We've had other offers of alliance.

38:22.480 --> 38:26.120
-Why is Aethelstan doing this?
-He says to unite Christians.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.040
And in his prayers,
he talks much of atonement.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.400
Atonement? For what?

38:32.160 --> 38:35.400
The death of his brother,
the bastardy of his parentage?

38:36.200 --> 38:37.240
I do not know.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.960
Lord Aldhelm and I try daily to dissuade,

38:42.040 --> 38:44.960
but there is talk of conquest
and forced baptism.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.400
-Where is he?
-The Devil's Stones.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.440
He thinks he fights the devil.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.600
This is madness. Aldhelm.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.480
These stones have stood for generations.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.800
They are an insult to God, apparently.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.000
Is that Owain, King of Strathclyde?

39:09.760 --> 39:11.520
Aethelstan wanted him to witness it.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.280
They were built by his forebears.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.200
He is seeking to humiliate powerful men?

39:20.880 --> 39:21.880
 King Hywel.

39:23.840 --> 39:26.360
He dares ask submission from Wealas?

39:27.600 --> 39:29.160
After all you did for Mercia?

39:29.240 --> 39:31.040
What choice do I have, Uhtred?

39:31.800 --> 39:33.400
He took my son to Winchester.

39:33.480 --> 39:37.520
-He is keeping your son hostage?
-You take the son, you take a future king.

39:38.120 --> 39:42.640
-Now I am forced to follow his bidding.
-I will tell him this cannot stand.

39:43.320 --> 39:47.440
King Hywel, I swear,
Wealas's faithfulness will not be spat on.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.280
Our poets spoke this.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.800
That a Saxon would break us all
to build their country.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.040
This is not just a Saxon country.

39:59.440 --> 40:03.200
Aldhelm, get me close to him.
I will stop this.

40:04.520 --> 40:05.840
Halt. Stay back.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.640
Step aside!
The king requested Uhtred speak with him.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.280
King Aethelstan!

40:29.280 --> 40:30.320
Lord King,

40:31.360 --> 40:32.840
let me speak with you alone.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.040
You should not
have stepped on my land.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.520
You should not have broken your word,
humiliated me,

40:47.600 --> 40:49.160
as you humiliated my father.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.880
I'm trying to make you see
you're on the wrong path.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.560
-You do the bidding of Ingilmundr--
-I do the bidding of the Lord.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.920
Do you really seek to convert Danes?

40:57.440 --> 41:00.480
-Did I teach you nothing of respect?
-Many Danes welcome the Lord.

41:00.560 --> 41:04.000
-Those in my court thank me for it.
-Many do not wish it, and you know this.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.560
Aethelstan, you've always known it.

41:07.120 --> 41:11.200
-Even Alfred respected this.
-I have more to atone for than Alfred.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.640
Who tells you this? Ingilmundr?

41:13.720 --> 41:16.480
Does he tell you
you are damned without his guidance?

41:16.560 --> 41:20.800
For I've seen before men under the spell
of those who claim to know the gods.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.840
He has been a great friend to me.

41:26.440 --> 41:27.960
Aethelstan, hump who you wish,

41:28.040 --> 41:30.840
but do not fall under the influence
of those who seek power--

41:30.920 --> 41:32.520
Who makes such vicious claim against me?

41:33.040 --> 41:34.560
-No one.
-Who tells such lies?

41:34.640 --> 41:37.400
-It has not been talked of.
-Lord Aldhelm, does he spy for…

41:37.480 --> 41:39.640
What has been said,
by who, and for how long?

41:39.720 --> 41:43.520
No one has said anything.
I care not for that, but for you.

41:44.280 --> 41:47.200
Aethelstan, you are a kind man,
but you are tenderhearted,

41:47.280 --> 41:50.160
and Ingilmundr is seeking power
for himself and for his brotherhood.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.640
Lies. Lies and ignominy.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.080
There's no ignominy.
He just turns you from your kin.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.920
And you are turned from your king!

41:56.760 --> 41:58.280
You seek to be one yourself.

41:59.840 --> 42:01.760
Lord, they consecrate the ground

42:01.840 --> 42:04.040
and would request you
to give the blessing.

42:06.880 --> 42:07.920
Yes, of course.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.440
Let us leave the King of Northumbria
to think on his errors.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.240
I have no dream to be a king.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.120
Only to protect you.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.520
Like you ran to protect him in Aegelesburg
and ended up being beaten by boys?

42:24.480 --> 42:28.240
Should he really take counsel from a man
who loses his sword to a child?

42:28.320 --> 42:30.880
Northumbria needs a lord
with lust for battle.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.720
There are rumors Anlaf has arrived
and will come Viking.

42:36.640 --> 42:40.240
Do not think he will spare you
just because you follow the same gods.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.880
Keep him here a night
and make him swear at dawn.

42:53.240 --> 42:55.840
In time, you will come
begging for his help.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.240
As all fathers fall,

42:59.400 --> 43:01.200
and all sons take their place.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.400
Sh.

43:24.080 --> 43:27.120
Lord Ingilmundr has declared you
an enemy of God

43:27.200 --> 43:29.040
to incite his followers to kill you.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.720
Aethelstan would not allow it.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.920
Which is why Ingilmundr
seeks to keep his hands clean of it

43:35.000 --> 43:36.200
and has left the camp.

43:38.200 --> 43:39.080
To go where?

43:42.600 --> 43:43.600
This way.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.320
Go up and around. There's no guard.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.000
Him. That is the man.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.880
What did you speak of with the pagan?

44:15.840 --> 44:17.480
Horsemen approach!

44:19.680 --> 44:22.720
Stay back from my gates
and tell me who you are.

44:22.800 --> 44:26.000
Lord Ingilmundr,
and I come at Lord Uhtred's request.

44:26.080 --> 44:29.240
He's delayed in Eoferwic
as he renews his vow to the king.

44:29.840 --> 44:31.360
He asked I help protect you.

44:31.440 --> 44:32.800
Protect from what?

44:32.880 --> 44:36.040
There is a rumor of Wolf-Warriors
landed near Derwent.

44:40.560 --> 44:43.000
Open the gate! Open the gate!

44:58.000 --> 44:59.520
Do not give the order.

45:01.720 --> 45:03.800
Think on all we have shared.

45:04.840 --> 45:07.000
You're lost from yourself, Aethelstan.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.480
We fought together--

45:08.560 --> 45:12.000
And despite this, you drip poison
against me and plot with Uhtred.

45:12.080 --> 45:12.960
-No.
-Yes.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.280
-No.
-Yes!

45:14.360 --> 45:16.160
You turned your back, Aldhelm.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.640
Now I turn mine.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.160
Lord Ingilmundr,

46:26.240 --> 46:29.920
you bring welcome news
of Lord Uhtred's supplication.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
Will you journey south with me
to let me bear witness to it?

46:33.080 --> 46:37.040
Lady, we have ridden hard to get here.
At least let us rest a day or so.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.680
Oh, but I have been trapped in Bebbanburg
a good while.

46:39.760 --> 46:43.800
Believe me, you do not want to find
yourself here longer than intended.

46:46.160 --> 46:48.120
-They've been warned!
- Now!

46:55.240 --> 46:56.920
We overtook you on the road.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.640
Whatever power you hold over Aethelstan,

47:01.200 --> 47:02.320
today it ends.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.520
My sword!

47:07.560 --> 47:09.360
You still believe in Valhalla!

47:10.400 --> 47:13.680
Aethelstan cares for you.
I will not divide us further.

47:13.760 --> 47:14.840
Put him below.

47:14.920 --> 47:18.360
Christians amongst you, defend me!
Who is your Lord?

47:18.440 --> 47:20.040
Lord Uhtred or the Lord Jesus Christ?

47:20.120 --> 47:22.760
The people of Bebbanburg
will not be divided by faith.

47:22.840 --> 47:23.800
Rise up, you fools!

47:24.320 --> 47:26.640
Tell the king the terms of his release.

47:26.720 --> 47:29.800
He makes peace with Northumbria
and guarantees the border.

47:29.880 --> 47:32.680
-No one is forced to follow his god.
-Yes, Lord.

47:33.680 --> 47:34.600
Quite a price.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.680
-Will Aethelstan agree?
- Let us hope so.

47:37.760 --> 47:40.400
He seems to discard his friends
rather quickly now.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.360
Truly, you bless
an unworthy soul.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.880
-May God reward your kindness.
-Amen.

48:49.080 --> 48:51.640
 Aethelstan turns
against his friends.

48:54.040 --> 48:57.760
Succumbs to a wild dream
to be a monarch for all your land.

49:00.200 --> 49:02.560
In time, he will come for you, Shetland.

49:03.680 --> 49:04.560
You, Orkney.

49:05.920 --> 49:09.680
He will take what belonged
to your forebears and call it Britain.

49:11.600 --> 49:12.440
No.

49:13.520 --> 49:17.280
He barely sets his foot upon the water.
Saxon country folk.

49:18.040 --> 49:19.240
We can repel them.

49:19.320 --> 49:23.200
I'm not talking of repelling,
but of meeting conquest with conquest.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.760
Scotland rejects your offer.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.760
We cannot join with pagans
to attack a man who's not threatened us.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.440
Christians do not choose war.

49:38.080 --> 49:38.960
War is coming.

49:41.040 --> 49:43.120
You only have to choose a side.

49:59.640 --> 50:00.920
God be with you.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.760
The stone was rolled away,
as in the scripture.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.680
It can only be the work of an angel.

50:28.200 --> 50:31.440
This way, Lord.
Come and see the treasures.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.360
Lord!

50:34.720 --> 50:36.200
What word from Eoferwic?

50:37.280 --> 50:38.760
Does he accept my terms?

50:39.520 --> 50:40.440
I have no news.

50:41.040 --> 50:43.520
Aethelstan is said
to have returned to Winchester.

50:45.920 --> 50:48.080
Well, let us take it as a good sign.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.680
Perhaps without his shadow,
Aethelstan sees more clearly.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.120
What trouble
brings you out here?

50:55.200 --> 50:57.360
The villagers were
hunting for pagan silver.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.200
Now they're saying it's a miracle.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.800
Make way
for the King of Northumbria.

51:02.320 --> 51:03.200
I told you.

51:03.280 --> 51:05.200
They think of you as a king.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.520
Do you think
they hope to keep half for themselves?

51:10.040 --> 51:12.800
They likely took it
from Bebbanburg in the first place.

51:14.440 --> 51:17.240
You are detained
in the name of King Aethelstan.

51:17.320 --> 51:18.240
Lord.

51:20.200 --> 51:21.520
We've been lured here.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.240
You think?

51:26.760 --> 51:28.400
Lord, I'm sorry!

51:28.480 --> 51:29.840
I'm sorry, Lord.

51:30.480 --> 51:34.600
The prisoner told me I had to,
or I'd burn in the fires of hell.

52:01.720 --> 52:03.920
I will never order to open the gates.

52:07.320 --> 52:08.440
Really?

52:08.520 --> 52:10.360
A gift from the king.

52:13.800 --> 52:14.640
Oh.

52:16.280 --> 52:17.480
Aethelstan did this?

52:17.560 --> 52:19.200
It's what he does to traitors.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.560
Open the gates or I slaughter your father.

52:23.640 --> 52:26.120
Comply and he will be spared.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.160
Do not open.

52:27.880 --> 52:30.000
-I can kill him in front of you.
-Do not open!

52:30.080 --> 52:33.000
-The choice is yours.
- Osbert! Do not open!

52:33.080 --> 52:35.440
In your absence, Father, I command here.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.040
And I command that we open.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.800
-No!
- No, no, no!

52:52.480 --> 52:53.680
Drop your sword.

52:54.760 --> 52:55.600
Move.

52:55.680 --> 52:56.880
No.

52:59.000 --> 52:59.960
Where is Aethelstan?

53:00.760 --> 53:01.600
In time.

53:03.240 --> 53:04.800
Bring me the Lady Eadgifu.

53:05.400 --> 53:06.760
Come.

53:06.840 --> 53:08.120
I can walk.

53:13.080 --> 53:13.920
Go on.

53:15.240 --> 53:16.080
Kill me.

53:16.160 --> 53:18.640
You are to be placed
in the community on Lindisfarne

53:18.720 --> 53:19.920
to protect your virtue.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.160
Did you hump the heathen, Lady?

53:26.880 --> 53:27.720
Confess.

53:29.920 --> 53:30.880
I confess

53:31.880 --> 53:35.160
to have prayed
for your excruciating death.

53:35.760 --> 53:38.960
A no, then. You should have tried
when you had the chance.

53:39.840 --> 53:41.360
We're taking your son to my garrison

53:41.440 --> 53:43.600
at Thelwael
where he will be trained for battle.

53:43.680 --> 53:44.840
No. No. Please.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.560
- Move!
-Your son also.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.680
No.
Edmund is the blood of Alfred.

53:48.760 --> 53:51.000
He should not be fodder for a shield wall!
Please!

53:51.080 --> 53:52.960
- I will take care of him.
-Please!

53:54.760 --> 53:57.320
The son of Uhtred stands for Wessex.

53:59.480 --> 54:00.360
Ah.

54:00.440 --> 54:01.400
Hey! Hey!

54:02.240 --> 54:03.120
Whoa.

54:03.760 --> 54:05.200
You, we have a plan for.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.920
- Am I to be drowned in the sea?
- I never quite know his mind.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.760
Do not punish
those in Bebbanburg.

54:14.840 --> 54:17.560
-His fight is with me.
-His fight is elsewhere.

54:18.640 --> 54:21.880
How lucky we have found ourselves
so close to the Scottish border.

54:21.960 --> 54:24.600
No, do not invade Scotland.
You will lose hundreds of men.

54:24.680 --> 54:26.240
And unleash a war for generations.

54:26.320 --> 54:29.600
The king has no successor to fear for.
It makes him strong.

54:29.680 --> 54:33.880
Do whatever you must to protect our sons.
Do not fight him. Just capitulate.

54:33.960 --> 54:35.280
Anything else is foolish.

54:40.040 --> 54:42.840
-Aldhelm never betrayed you.
-All of you betrayed me.

54:44.560 --> 54:46.280
All those I thought as friends.

54:48.240 --> 54:51.000
Swear now, before Bebbanburg,
and I will spare your life.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.200
-No.
-Then you leave me with no choice.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.000
Aethelstan.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.160
I cannot.

55:16.480 --> 55:17.840
-Let me offer my--
-No.

55:22.480 --> 55:23.960
Take everything from him.

55:37.080 --> 55:40.680
I banish you from my lands
to travel the earth and seas alone.

55:41.960 --> 55:43.960
On pain of murder of your son.

55:44.680 --> 55:47.720
Let none feed or clothe him,
lest become my enemy.

55:51.080 --> 55:51.920
Go.

55:53.280 --> 55:54.880
Before this mercy vanishes.

56:24.760 --> 56:27.160
 Turn back. There is still time.

56:27.960 --> 56:29.440
The Scots are no threat.

56:30.160 --> 56:32.360
This will damn you, Lord King.

56:37.960 --> 56:41.320
To save us from the pagans
can be a just endeavor.

56:45.600 --> 56:48.800
But to turn on other Christians
is ungodly.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.120
Your men do not want this fight.

57:05.200 --> 57:07.320
Well, perhaps
I need better men.

57:08.680 --> 57:10.360
Perhaps I should summon your son.

57:11.320 --> 57:12.160
Lord King!

57:12.920 --> 57:15.320
Aethelstan has attacked settlements
in the lowlands.

57:16.440 --> 57:18.640
He cannot raid us without reply.

57:20.800 --> 57:24.360
Do I tell Anlaf you are ready
to meet with him and the other kings?

57:56.040 --> 57:57.480
Uhtred the Daneslayer.

57:58.320 --> 58:01.280
You killed my cousin Gelf
at the battle of Beamfleot.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.120
…the battle of Beamfleot.

58:03.200 --> 58:04.640
Send word we have found him.

58:06.080 --> 58:07.840
I hated Gelf.

58:07.920 --> 58:09.360
Gelf, Gelf…

58:09.440 --> 58:10.720
Take him to the king.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.720
Where are you taking me?

58:15.800 --> 58:17.720
To the very north
of these islands.

58:46.320 --> 58:50.360
- What do you give thanks for?
-For the great battle to come.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.080
Tell the jarl we're here
with the King of Northumbria.

58:57.800 --> 59:02.520
- All folk of Shetland?
- Some of Man and Orkney join us.

59:03.080 --> 59:05.120
With their kings.

59:23.960 --> 59:25.400
Is this who they claim?

59:25.480 --> 59:27.160
The King of Northumbria?

59:27.880 --> 59:29.520
Aye, it's him.

59:31.200 --> 59:32.840
-I am no king.
- No.

59:34.240 --> 59:35.280
But you could be.

59:36.680 --> 59:39.000
Sit. You are amongst friends.

59:43.520 --> 59:45.120
You join with pagans?

59:46.360 --> 59:49.680
Aethelstan has taken an axe to the truce.

59:50.280 --> 59:52.080
A truce you brokered.

59:52.160 --> 59:54.520
What he has done
in the villages of the lowlands--

59:54.600 --> 59:57.800
-Is it worse than his cruelty in Irland?
-Tales to spread fear.

59:57.880 --> 1:00:00.920
We had no choice
but to defend ourselves.

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:02.880
We did not start this.

1:00:03.400 --> 1:00:07.680
-How did you find me? Who's your spy?
-We have many spies. We know many things.

1:00:07.760 --> 1:00:10.000
We know
Aethelstan has banished you.

1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:12.080
And we know he gets humped like a woman.

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:14.880
That may be customary to you pagans,

1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:17.920
but as a Christian, it cannot be endured.

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.560
-He endures it often, from what I hear.
-So…

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:24.560
As a man who shares our enemy,

1:00:25.440 --> 1:00:29.120
we ask you to join with us, Uhtred,
in our alliance.

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:31.800
Stand against the tyrant.

1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:33.440
I'm heartsick of battles.

1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:37.120
What has become of the warrior?
Do you no longer yearn for Valhalla?

1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:39.240
Do you know the prophecy, Uhtred?

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:42.400
The ancient prophecy of my people?

1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:46.440
All of Britain
will unite against the Saxons,

1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:48.320
push them into the Kentish sea,

1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:51.160
return the feals to the line of Arthur.

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:52.360
There.

1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:54.400
The vision of an old man.

1:00:55.480 --> 1:00:58.960
-So it must be true.
-We Northumbrians also have a prophecy.

1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:03.080
"Seven kings must die."

1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:07.720
That holds no fear.

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:10.280
Each man here has a son to take his place.

1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:11.920
Seven kings die,

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.680
seven will, in that moment, be made.

1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:15.800
It's true.

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:18.800
If you make a child,
your kingdom stands beyond you.

1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:21.080
A kingdom ravaged by war, yes.

1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:23.160
Then there is another way

1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:24.840
to consider.

1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:28.640
If you wish to save many from bloodshed.

1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:31.000
Kill one man only.

1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:34.520
Kill the king who has attacked us all.

1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:37.440
Return to him in… supplication.

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:40.160
Seize the moment.

1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:46.240
Save many lives by simply taking one.

1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:48.480
The alternative,
of course, is war.

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.240
Seven kings against one.

1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:57.120
If Aethelstan wanted to unite
the tribes of Britain,

1:01:58.080 --> 1:01:59.120
he has succeeded.

1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:16.920
Why do you seek us here?

1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:20.040
Your part is to keep Winchester aroused.

1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:24.160
You let Uhtred go free. Why?

1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:26.000
I sent him away.

1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:29.080
To kill your friend, the king.

1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:34.080
-Well, he will be killed in the attempt.

1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:35.920
Uhtred has skills you do not.

1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:39.240
He attacks Aethelstan.
Aethelstan attacks him.

1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:41.480
It barely matters.

1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:44.880
Either way, we face in battle
men whose spirits have been broken.

1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:48.880
Ingilmundr, go to the West.
The time is near.

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:51.600
Astrid, watch our friends in Northumbria.

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:27.200
I did not think
I would see you again.

1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:38.920
Lord King.

1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:43.520
In the name of my son, I beg forgiveness.

1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:46.680
Spare him.

1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:49.400
Let me kneel to you.

1:03:58.680 --> 1:04:00.360
Then I lift your banishment.

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:05.640
Give me a sword and then leave us.

1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:27.040
Go on, then.

1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:30.680
Do it.

1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:08.560
I swear this on my son's life.

1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:10.400
Hear this as an oath.

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:20.520
Ingilmundr is a spy.

1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:24.000
He's working with Anlaf
to ally British kings against you.

1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:26.320
-Lies.
-It is true. I saw him in Shetland.

1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:29.240
He told Anlaf's warriors to track me.
They tried to turn me--

1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:30.800
No!

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:34.560
-He is in Thelwael with your son!
-He told them things of you.

1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:38.520
He still follows my gods.

1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:43.880
For now, you have an advantage.

1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:46.640
Ingilmundr does not know
he has been discovered.

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:53.040
No, he would not betray me.

1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:54.720
If anything, I have betrayed him.

1:05:54.800 --> 1:05:57.400
-No.
-He is a man of God, and I am a sinner!

1:05:57.480 --> 1:06:00.800
He has convinced you of this
to provoke your campaign.

1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:02.640
-To unite your enemies.
-No!

1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:06.800
Aethelstan, please see this. This alliance
he has gathered is too large.

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:09.320
-Your lands will be overrun.
-No! You lie!

1:06:10.280 --> 1:06:11.520
This is all lies!

1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:15.440
Aethelstan, please hear me.

1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:18.680
Why would I lie to you?

1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:20.320
-Get out.
-Aethelstan--

1:06:20.400 --> 1:06:22.840
Get out. Get from my sight! Guards!

1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:24.320
-Take him!

1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:36.520
Ah!

1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:39.640
You dog! On your way.

1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:43.320
We search every forest,
every valley.

1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:46.320
And here he is,
back in the lap of luxury.

1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:48.360
We heard you needed us.

1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:51.560
Truly the gods smiled at me
to give me such friends.

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:55.960
Let's find ourselves an alehouse,

1:06:56.600 --> 1:06:57.440
make a plan.

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.520
-Who told you I was here?
- She said you called for us.

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:05.920
-Did you not send for us, Lord?
-She said you needed us.

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.040
And requested a guard.

1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:09.240
Danish girl, serves in Aethelstan's court.

1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:12.480
Finan, I sent no word.

1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:15.400
No command for you to leave Bebbanburg.

1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:29.360
- Stay here and guard the gates.
- Yes, Lord.

1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:32.520
Wolf-Warriors.

1:07:55.080 --> 1:07:56.680
This is Anlaf's doing.

1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:02.480
Ingrith!

1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:20.600
Lord, where are they all?

1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:31.560
- Eadgifu?
-Uhtred.

1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:34.040
What happened?

1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:36.480
When news reached us
of the attack and torture here,

1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:38.880
the abbess sent us to help the injured.

1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:44.280
But we cannot get to the injured.

1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:51.240
Where… Where is she? Where's my wife?

1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:02.600
"Seven kings must die," Lord.

1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:04.400
"Seven kings

1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:06.520
and the woman you love."

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:10.000
Ingrith!

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:12.960
-No. Ingrith!
-Every man is to help move it.

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:14.120
You, up above.

1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:16.880
- Can anyone hear me?
- Watch for signs of Anlaf's men.

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:19.440
We tried to help,
but all we could do was comfort them.

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:22.280
Uhtred, Ingrith said
they threatened to return.

1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:26.400
-We must secure ourselves.
-Not until we rescue those within.

1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:29.720
When did you speak last?

1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:31.880
About three days ago.

1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.520
- Get the rope up there!

1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:38.640
Come on!

1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:41.960
Pull!

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:45.280
Pull!

1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:48.280
Pull!

1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:54.960
Pull!

1:09:58.600 --> 1:09:59.520
Now!

1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:14.600
Finan.

1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:21.440
Where is…

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:29.160
No!

1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:23.720
I brought this on them.

1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:30.240
What they suffered is on Anlaf's account.

1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:35.520
You cannot let this break you.

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:38.400
We are broken.

1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:40.640
We have no allies. We're lost.

1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:44.200
Then we must find the courage
to defend Northumbria from their return.

1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:47.720
If we endure and keep them at siege,

1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:50.960
we will give those
in other parts of England time to prepare.

1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:53.080
Whatever we suffer

1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:55.600
protects those we are apart from.

1:11:55.680 --> 1:11:56.960
She's right, Lord.

1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:59.240
Osbert can cross the Irish Sea, get to--

1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:00.280
The Irish Sea?

1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:07.560
We must find the fastest horses. I think
Anlaf is hoping to turn all eyes here.

1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:10.040
To lure Aethelstan.

1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:16.560
But they will land where they have men.
Ingilmundr holds a garrison in the Wirral.

1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:20.000
With… With our sons.

1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:12.040
Something's underway.

1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:15.480
I'm ready.

1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:16.560
Take care.

1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:18.640
- Get in the cart.

1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:23.080
Those of you with swords to your throats
face a decision.

1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:26.840
A thousand ships
are heading towards these shores.

1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:28.840
Some have already landed.

1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:32.680
Within a week,
Saxon boroughs will be overrun.

1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:36.680
Join us and fight the tyrant Aethelstan,

1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:38.400
or die.

1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:41.600
For King Ed--

1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:07.280
- Keep still.
- This way!

1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:09.920
Yes, sir. I believe so.

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.800
We saw them, but they got away.

1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:18.200
-There. Far away.
-Thank you.

1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:19.520
Yes, my lord.

1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:22.280
No word from Thelwael, Lord.

1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:23.880
Told them all I knew.

1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:28.800
Sihtric.

1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:30.600
Lord?

1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:33.360
Do we finally face defeat?

1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:41.480
All the warrior kings that I've known,
Ubba, Cnut, Bloodhair,

1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:46.120
all have faced defeat in the end
and have taken others with them.

1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:51.480
The fight was always coming, Lord.
No warrior dies a peaceful death.

1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:54.760
She saw it all. "Seven kings must die."

1:14:57.560 --> 1:14:58.800
We have hope.

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:02.000
In your heart,
you never wanted to be a king.

1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:17.320
Have those fleeing
heard anything of my son?

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:23.160
Then until I know for sure,

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:25.400
he is alive.

1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:32.640
And if conquest is easy, perhaps
Anlaf may be satisfied with Mercia.

1:15:32.720 --> 1:15:35.520
-It is fertile--
- He will not be satisfied.

1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:39.640
They come Viking now
to extinguish an idea of England.

1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:44.200
A dream unites a people
who once sought to kill each other.

1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:49.520
Without it, we go back
into an age of darkness.

1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:57.240
We have both lost so much.

1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:00.600
But I ask myself…

1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:05.120
am I alive?

1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:11.080
Can you feel it?

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:14.600
You are alive.

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:19.080
So are you.

1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:23.960
So we have hope.

1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:47.040
Edmund?

1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:49.520
Osbert?

1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:52.240
Edmund?

1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:15.120
I came seeking Ingilmundr.

1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:19.920
To prove that you had lied to me.

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:23.760
But you had not.

1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:29.920
We came to search for our sons.

1:17:41.160 --> 1:17:42.920
Bring out Osbert and Edmund.

1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:01.600
Osbert!

1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:06.560
They hid themselves
and were spared the massacre.

1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:07.800
Lord King,

1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:10.120
you have my endless gratitude.

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:13.960
I've not been myself
this past year, and truly,

1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:15.000
truly, I…

1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:16.840
I pay for my sins.

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:22.280
I face a great alliance at Brunanburh.

1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:24.160
All regret is worthless.

1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:27.480
Let us speak only of the fight to come.

1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:31.720
-Osbert, what have you learnt?
-They've set up camp on high ground.

1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:34.280
And they have six armies.

1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:36.960
Then seven armies
shall meet at Brunanburh.

1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:39.040
I do not want you to fight for me, Uhtred.

1:18:39.120 --> 1:18:41.440
- Trust I'm on your side--
-I know that.

1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:43.280
Save yourself.

1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:48.840
Take your son to safety.

1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:53.800
If I do not survive the battle,
then succession will be secure.

1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:55.440
You cannot fight this alliance alone.

1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:57.560
Yet I forbid you
from taking part.

1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:00.360
Take him, Father Pyrlig.
Please, take them all.

1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:04.720
-I've dragged you all to this fate.
- Let us serve you.

1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:06.280
Aethelstan…

1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:10.200
this is not a punishment.

1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:12.200
I think we both know that it is.

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:16.640
This is martyrdom.

1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:19.400
He will not survive so great a number.

1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:21.480
But we have been reprieved.

1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:26.400
-God is telling us to get to safety.
-Your god does not speak to me.

1:19:26.480 --> 1:19:29.440
It is not cowardly
to spurn a battle that cannot be won.

1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:30.560
It is.

1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:34.200
However this prevails, I will have to know
I walked away from danger.

1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:35.640
Your battles will come

1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:38.440
when you become king.

1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:40.600
King of where, Mother?

1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:44.720
-We will fight with the shield wall.
-No.

1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:46.640
-Osbert, are you ready?
-I've always been ready.

1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:50.640
Pyrlig, you once told me
that it was my destiny to save England.

1:19:50.720 --> 1:19:54.480
Hadn't seen it quite like this,
but then I'm not one for prophecies.

1:19:54.560 --> 1:19:57.240
What if your destiny
is to protect Edmund?

1:19:57.760 --> 1:20:01.760
Perhaps he is the one to unite England.
He could be the king who was worthy.

1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:03.720
No king will form England.

1:20:04.240 --> 1:20:05.600
This is what I see now.

1:20:06.480 --> 1:20:10.280
Not Edmund or Edward or Alfred.
Not even Aethelstan.

1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:13.920
Alfred's dream was of a united people.

1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:17.840
And with these men,
from all parts, I fought for it.

1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:20.240
What if our destiny
was not to form England,

1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:24.520
but to form the English as one force?

1:20:26.840 --> 1:20:30.680
Who better than a half Saxon, half Dane
to lead men from divided places?

1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:32.120
We go!

1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:36.240
I don't have to call myself English, do I?

1:21:19.800 --> 1:21:22.400
To hear that,
you'd think they'd won already.

1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:40.360
We should make our way.

1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:43.160
If this is to work,
we need to be on the front line.

1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:46.040
-We'll aim for their left side.
-Why?

1:21:52.160 --> 1:21:53.040
Why the left?

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:56.600
Weaker. Most men fight
with the sword in their right hand.

1:21:56.680 --> 1:22:00.240
I've fought with Uhtred many times.
Trust he will find a way.

1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:02.680
You.

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:06.120
Where did you find that?

1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:08.760
I bought it in Aegelesburg
for five pieces.

1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:11.560
May I?

1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:34.600
I will exchange it for this one.

1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:40.120
It is worth much more,
and it has a garnet.

1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:44.280
When I say exchange, I mean
you take that one, and I keep this one.

1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:50.120
I am no commander of yours.

1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:53.960
I have no authority other than being
a man who has fought in many battles.

1:22:56.040 --> 1:22:57.400
Some of you I have led before.

1:22:58.960 --> 1:23:01.240
Today I stand with you
as a simple soldier.

1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:04.640
But I ask that, on the field,

1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:06.840
you once again let me guide you.

1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:10.080
Our position on the hill is weak,

1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:14.800
but the trees to our left give us
an advantage the enemy will not see.

1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:17.520
We can defeat them

1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:19.800
if we stay united.

1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:50.240
-This is one way to clear the ale.
-Smell of a thousand armpits.

1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:53.240
Aye.
Maybe they smelled us and ran away.

1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:55.840
- Maybe.
- Who touched my arse?

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:22.280
Oh my God!

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:23.440
Jesus!

1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:34.280
Rather a lot of them, isn't there?

1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:52.400
Uhtred?

1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:53.920
Uhtred.

1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:56.760
-How do we face this?
-You see these bags?

1:24:56.840 --> 1:24:59.000
Give them to the men
on the front line. Go.

1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:10.680
Do not raise your shield
until you have to.

1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:14.240
Stay at ease. Stay relaxed.

1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:18.520
-And do not show them we are unsettled.
- Lord!

1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:20.240
He's here.

1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:32.040
Here he comes. The tyrant himself.

1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:38.880
Is it done?

1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:42.280
-Get back as far as you can.
-Yeah.

1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:07.560
Shield wall!

1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:33.440
-Are we ready, arselings?
- Yeah!

1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:35.240
I have taken their confessions.

1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:37.840
When I ask you to give ground,

1:26:38.840 --> 1:26:39.880
do it.

1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:42.960
When you see the trees in front of you,
it will be time.

1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:44.320
Do you think this will work?

1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.760
If it does not,
we will not be here to see it.

1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:50.640
Trust me.

1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:52.640
And follow.

1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:54.960
Shield wall!

1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:57.920
Shield!

1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:00.160
Wall!

1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:07.240
Step back!

1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:12.680
Back!

1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:16.480
They retreat?

1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:18.960
Even before we engage?

1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:22.320
-Step back!
- They know they have lost already.

1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:24.120
Let's enjoy it.

1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:27.120
- Forward!

1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:30.480
I thank God,
who I serve with pure conscience.

1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:34.400
God hath not given us a spirit of fear,
but of power…

1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:35.680
-…love…

1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:38.000
-…and of sound mind!

1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:40.040
Amen.

1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:55.720
Step back!

1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:08.600
Brace!

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:20.400
Re-form! Charge!

1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:29.800
Saxon bastards!

1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:43.720
Pyrlig!

1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:45.640
No!

1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:50.440
Pyrlig!

1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:08.400
-Two paces! One pace!
-Mm-hmm.

1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:10.720
-On my command!
- Let's hope this works!

1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:12.160
Two paces back!

1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:13.080
Back!

1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:15.400
Step back!

1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:16.720
One pace back!

1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:22.720
They back off. We have them.

1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:29.360
-Find the king!
- Find the king!

1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:42.600
Step back!

1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:44.400
Go backwards!

1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:47.640
For Shetland!

1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:49.080
For Orkney!

1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:53.600
Step back!

1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:02.360
-Keep going!

1:30:02.440 --> 1:30:03.360
Back!

1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:06.480
Protect the line! Protect the line!

1:30:12.800 --> 1:30:14.080
Step back!

1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:16.760
They'll overrun us
if we keep giving ground!

1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:18.480
What are they doing along the flank?

1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:22.800
Send a message
that Aethelstan is in front of us!

1:30:23.320 --> 1:30:24.560
Step back!

1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:26.760
Step back!

1:30:26.840 --> 1:30:30.280
The line's turning, Lord.
We're coming around!

1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:32.680
Aethelstan is on the Scots' line, Lord.

1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:34.120
Swine wedge!

1:30:35.240 --> 1:30:36.640
Step back!

1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:39.800
Swine wedge!

1:30:47.640 --> 1:30:50.000
Anlaf! Stop!

1:30:50.080 --> 1:30:52.640
Push forward!

1:30:52.720 --> 1:30:54.800
They're going for Aethelstan!

1:30:55.400 --> 1:30:56.320
Step back!

1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:10.320
Back!

1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:15.280
The wall will not hold!

1:31:16.440 --> 1:31:19.000
Aethelstan, hold the line!

1:31:19.080 --> 1:31:21.840
- How much longer, Lord?
- We're almost there.

1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:31.640
They're breaking through
Aethelstan's line, Lord!

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:33.800
We can't hold!

1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:35.000
Step back!

1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:37.240
Push forward!

1:31:42.360 --> 1:31:43.440
Lord!

1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:47.240
Lord.

1:31:58.440 --> 1:31:59.920
Protect the king!

1:32:00.560 --> 1:32:01.480
Aethelstan!

1:32:01.560 --> 1:32:03.320
Lord, trees!

1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:06.720
We've turned them, Lord!
We've turned the line.

1:32:07.240 --> 1:32:09.240
- Give the signal!
- Yes, Lord.

1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:11.560
-Something's not right.
- We've been turned around!

1:32:11.640 --> 1:32:13.400
Make way! Make way!

1:32:20.920 --> 1:32:22.520
Lord Uhtred orders the signal.

1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:46.560
Attack!

1:32:55.040 --> 1:32:56.160
Yah!

1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:09.360
Behind!

1:33:14.840 --> 1:33:15.920
Hunt down their kings!

1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:17.160
It's a trap!

1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:44.040
My son!

1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:17.240
No!

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:28.040
Guards!

1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:30.440
Fall back! Fall back!

1:34:33.600 --> 1:34:35.880
Scots! Fall back!

1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:41.200
-Hyah!

1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:15.840
Aethelstan!

1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:01.080
Aethelstan!

1:36:58.520 --> 1:36:59.640
Pyrlig?

1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:40.440
Five kings
escaped the field that day,

1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:41.760
but their sons,

1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:45.600
Orkney, Man, Shetland,

1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:49.200
Strathclyde, and Scotland, did not.

1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:50.560
Each man here

1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:53.520
has left behind an heir.

1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:54.720
We wait.

1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.080
Then attack those leaving the field
and return for our kin.

1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:01.480
Do not be
any more foolish, Anlaf.

1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:03.200
Shetland?

1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:06.840
No more death.

1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:10.320
Orkney, we need to fight!

1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:14.000
What is there to fight for?

1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:20.560
I need a ship to get back to Irland.

1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:28.600
You?

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.040
Lord!

1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:48.200
Uhtred!

1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:53.200
Uhtred!

1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:56.240
Hey. Hey, you.

1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:00.920
Finan! Finan!

1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:28.720
 Was any of it real?

1:39:31.280 --> 1:39:32.360
Tell me the truth.

1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:37.600
When you find yourself before God,
you will have confessed.

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:45.600
I grew fond of you.

1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:52.120
-But my love for my people prevailed.
-I chose you over my people.

1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:55.880
Perhaps my gods are stronger than yours.

1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:00.320
Then why am I living…

1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:03.920
and you about to die?

1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:08.960
Only fools try to understand destiny.

1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:08.000
Uhtred.

1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:10.720
Did my son survive?

1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:11.640
Yes.

1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:19.040
And Bebbanburg is ours again.

1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:23.520
-We will rebuild in stone.
- There is so much future.

1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:25.960
Stay with us, Uhtred.

1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:31.040
-What of the enemy?
- The victory is ours.

1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:34.560
Five sons of kings
lay dead upon the battlefield.

1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:39.240
-Five kings that will never be crowned.
- "Seven kings must die."

1:42:39.320 --> 1:42:41.040
The prophecy was wrong, Lord.

1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:44.680
With Edward of Wessex, it makes six.

1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:47.600
Am I to be the seventh?

1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:52.440
I have told the chroniclers
to write of your victory, Uhtred.

1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:55.240
I have no wish
to be written into your history.

1:42:55.920 --> 1:43:00.680
I want only to be honored
in the feast hall for standing by an oath.

1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:17.360
Uhtred, you did not just stand by me.

1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:20.280
You stood for me.

1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:24.520
You led where I could not.

1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:27.320
And you forgave me

1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:30.120
when I was unforgivable.

1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:36.600
You saved the hope of England.

1:43:39.200 --> 1:43:41.200
Now in time, it may yet happen.

1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:45.120
I said that…

1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:49.680
if you proved yourself
to be the rightful king,

1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:53.360
I would swear Northumbria to you.

1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:00.040
Men have died
fighting under the name of the English.

1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:04.000
To honor them, England should be formed.

1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:08.560
But I have one condition.

1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:14.600
You must make an oath never to marry.

1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:16.360
No heirs.

1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:20.480
So your brother Edmund
can take the throne unchallenged.

1:44:29.920 --> 1:44:30.760
Thank you.

1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:47.840
This oath

1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:49.840
I shall swear.

1:44:51.080 --> 1:44:53.080
Then we submit to you as our king.

1:44:55.160 --> 1:45:00.120
Which makes you ruler
of Wessex, Mercia, East Anglia,

1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:02.360
and Northumbria.

1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:06.240
And I call my lands

1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:08.680
England.

1:45:12.480 --> 1:45:13.760
Long live the king!

1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:15.440
Long live the king.

1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:18.520
Long live the King of England.

1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:25.640
Return to your chamber, Lord.

1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:31.240
Do not grieve for me.

1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:34.240
It was always written
that I would fall in battle.

1:45:34.320 --> 1:45:36.080
You're not gonna die, Lord.

1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:39.680
-I would go first, and I'm still alive…

1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:43.960
So,

1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:46.760
destiny is all.

1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:33.720
-Skál!
- Skál!

1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:04.360
Did seven kings die?

1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:09.200
The chronicles do not record
if my lord Uhtred survived.

1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:12.720
But those like me, who knew him,

1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:16.120
recognize him
as the greatest warrior of our age,

1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:19.440
and a man who made a kingdom.
