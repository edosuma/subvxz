00:03.423 --> 00:06.003
I know what I want, but I can't have it.
Not how you live.

00:06.526 --> 00:08.045
I'm trying to get over you.

00:08.428 --> 00:11.208
You love someone doesn't mean
you stick around, screw up their life.

00:11.764 --> 00:13.104
You're walking out on family.

00:13.466 --> 00:17.126
- What do you know about dragons?
- Dr. Visyak. Medieval studies, SFU.

00:17.804 --> 00:18.824
Bobby Singer.

00:19.138 --> 00:20.888
Tell him something for me next time.

00:21.307 --> 00:23.237
Actually, just kick him in the jewels.

00:23.676 --> 00:25.816
- Raphael...
- Tomorrow you kneel, Castiel.

00:26.279 --> 00:28.419
Are you proposing
that I start a civil war in heaven?

00:28.881 --> 00:30.021
Ding, ding, ding.

00:30.350 --> 00:32.130
- Balthazar.
- Of course I wanna help you.

00:32.552 --> 00:35.132
The amount of power
that it would take to mount a war...

00:35.655 --> 00:39.135
But what if I said
I knew how to go nuclear? Purgatory.

00:39.792 --> 00:42.372
You and Crowley are going
after purgatory together?

00:42.895 --> 00:45.295
- Just kill the Winchesters.
- No.

00:45.798 --> 00:48.728
- Then I'll do it myself.
- If you touch a hair on their heads...

00:49.302 --> 00:51.552
I will tear it all down,
our arrangement.

00:53.706 --> 00:55.846
- Hello, Dean.
- You're like a brother to me.

00:56.309 --> 00:59.589
So if I'm asking you not to do
something, you gotta trust me, man.

01:00.713 --> 01:01.673
Or what?

01:02.415 --> 01:04.754
Or I'll have to do
what I have to do to stop you.

01:05.284 --> 01:06.624
I'm sorry, Dean.

01:46.225 --> 01:47.515
Hello?

02:09.882 --> 02:11.222
Hello?

02:34.941 --> 02:37.021
Please, we didn't know.

02:38.177 --> 02:39.437
I'm sorry.

02:59.665 --> 03:01.305
Well, you know what?
At least you tried.

03:01.701 --> 03:03.871
Yeah, a fat lot of good it did.

03:04.437 --> 03:05.897
Why did he even come, right?

03:08.174 --> 03:10.664
Well, Samuel's journals are pointless.

03:11.177 --> 03:13.927
I mean, I'm sorry, but Jebediah Campbell
has squat to tell me...

03:14.480 --> 03:16.560
about how to stop Cass
from cracking purgatory.

03:17.016 --> 03:20.036
Well, actually,
it's not about the journals we have.

03:20.620 --> 03:21.960
It's about the one we don't.

03:22.655 --> 03:23.585
Meaning what?

03:23.923 --> 03:25.473
Well, that's the bad news.

03:25.858 --> 03:29.318
Our pal, Cass, didn't stop in last night
just to mend fences.

03:31.164 --> 03:32.094
What did he do?

03:32.565 --> 03:33.525
Stole something.

03:33.833 --> 03:36.733
- What?
- The journal of one Moishe Campbell.

03:37.303 --> 03:38.233
Moishe?

03:38.538 --> 03:39.708
Of the New York Campbells.

03:41.374 --> 03:43.394
Wha...? So we gotta get it back, right?

03:43.843 --> 03:45.953
Well, just read the copy
I had already made.

03:46.445 --> 03:47.705
Hi, glad to meet you.

03:48.047 --> 03:49.717
Bobby Singer, paranoid bastard.

03:51.851 --> 03:53.631
I think I zeroed in on something.

03:54.053 --> 03:55.603
What do you got?

03:57.523 --> 04:00.453
"Went to talk to Howard Phillips
about the events of March 10th."

04:01.027 --> 04:02.697
That's March 10th, 1937.

04:03.095 --> 04:04.935
All right, so who's this Phillips guy?

04:05.364 --> 04:07.534
Phillips ain't his last name.
It's Lovecraft.

04:08.668 --> 04:10.858
Wait, H.P. Lovecraft? Let me see that.

04:11.871 --> 04:13.771
Am I supposed to know who that is?

04:14.774 --> 04:15.734
Horror writer.

04:16.509 --> 04:18.559
<i>At the Mountains of Madness,
The Call of Cthulhu.</i>

04:21.581 --> 04:22.541
Yeah.

04:22.848 --> 04:24.988
No, I was too busy having sex
with women.

04:26.919 --> 04:30.579
Anyhow, there's one notion that comes
up over and over again in his stories.

04:31.257 --> 04:33.597
Namely, opening doors
to other dimensions...

04:34.093 --> 04:36.673
- and letting scary crap through.
- You don't say.

04:37.196 --> 04:40.126
So you're saying you think Lovecraft
knows something about purgatory?

04:41.267 --> 04:43.577
All I know is Moishe paid him a visit.

04:54.380 --> 04:58.420
<i>Patty's four for seven
against him with two extra base hits...</i>

04:59.151 --> 05:01.461
<i>and three RBis. And the pitch.</i>

05:01.954 --> 05:03.654
<i>Fastball. Lined to short for the out.</i>

05:04.056 --> 05:08.036
<i>Singletary tries to get the runner.
He dives back in and he's safe.</i>

05:10.796 --> 05:11.756
No.

05:12.331 --> 05:13.641
No.

05:17.303 --> 05:18.593
Just let her go, okay?

05:20.072 --> 05:21.272
No.

05:29.682 --> 05:31.052
No.

05:38.658 --> 05:40.148
- Ben?
- There's men in the house.

05:40.559 --> 05:42.779
They killed Matt, they got Mom.
They're coming.

05:43.262 --> 05:44.662
- What are they?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

05:45.064 --> 05:46.294
- Did you see their eyes?
<i>- No.</i>

05:46.632 --> 05:47.562
- Teeth?
- No.

05:47.867 --> 05:49.297
<i>- I need to know.</i>
- I don't know.

05:49.669 --> 05:50.979
- Where are you now?
<i>- In my room.</i>

05:51.337 --> 05:53.207
Get to your mom's closet.
I left a shotgun.

05:53.639 --> 05:55.009
Dean, what do I do?

05:58.144 --> 05:59.454
Okay, Ben, listen to me.

05:59.812 --> 06:02.472
- Go to your window and jump.
- What?

06:03.015 --> 06:05.795
Any bones you break won't compare
to what they're gonna do. Jump.

06:06.352 --> 06:07.932
Okay, I'm going.

06:09.722 --> 06:10.802
I'm coming right now.

06:11.657 --> 06:13.467
I'm gonna get you and your mom,
I promise.

06:14.327 --> 06:15.697
You with me, Ben?

06:16.996 --> 06:18.336
Ben.

06:20.666 --> 06:22.006
<i>Ben.</i>

06:28.641 --> 06:29.571
Hello, Dean.

06:31.143 --> 06:32.663
Fancy a chat?

06:37.611 --> 06:39.981
God, how long's it been, Dean?

06:40.514 --> 06:42.064
<i>Since my so-called demise, yes?</i>

06:42.450 --> 06:45.760
Crowley, let them go, now.

06:46.387 --> 06:47.317
Or I swear...

06:47.621 --> 06:50.431
<i>Right. Right.
You'll rip me a cornucopia of orifices.</i>

06:51.025 --> 06:53.245
<i>Let's get to the bit
where I tell you how this goes.</i>

06:53.728 --> 06:56.158
Your chocolate's been
in my peanut butter for too long.

06:56.664 --> 06:59.594
- I'm going to kill you.
<i>- Oh, Dean. Ever the wit.</i>

07:00.167 --> 07:02.337
I've got your, uh... What are they?

07:03.170 --> 07:05.630
Ex-lady friend and not-kid...

07:06.140 --> 07:08.630
<i>and I'm keeping them
until I'm satisfied...</i>

07:09.143 --> 07:10.923
that you've backed the hell off.

07:11.345 --> 07:12.335
I'm telling you.

07:12.646 --> 07:14.226
Last chance to let them go easy.

07:14.615 --> 07:17.245
You're adorable when you get
all threatening. Don't worry.

07:17.785 --> 07:18.865
I won't hurt them.

07:19.186 --> 07:22.086
Provided you
and Jolly Green stand down.

07:22.656 --> 07:25.316
Got it? Splendid. Kisses.

07:31.932 --> 07:33.272
What's the story?

07:34.635 --> 07:37.915
He said Lisa and Ben keep breathing
as long as we sit on our thumbs.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.888
You think Cass knows about this?

07:43.778 --> 07:45.768
We gotta assume he does.

07:46.213 --> 07:47.883
So, what are we gonna do?

07:48.783 --> 07:50.393
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

07:50.785 --> 07:52.095
Sit here. I'm going after them.

07:52.453 --> 07:54.123
- I'm going with.
- No, Sam.

07:54.989 --> 07:57.009
You and Bobby stay
on the Lovecraft thing, okay?

07:57.458 --> 07:58.478
Cass is way ahead of us.

07:58.793 --> 08:01.603
You're nuts if you think I'll let you
alone. Bobby takes the case.

08:02.163 --> 08:04.473
- No, guys...
- Bobby...

08:05.366 --> 08:06.976
This is a big ball, okay?

08:07.368 --> 08:08.448
We can't drop it now.

08:09.904 --> 08:10.894
Fine.

08:11.205 --> 08:13.105
Then how are you two
gonna find Lisa and Ben?

08:31.559 --> 08:34.308
I'm sorry, boys.
Do I look like a manservant to you?

08:36.864 --> 08:40.144
No? No. Then quit ringing for me,
please.

08:40.768 --> 08:41.878
This is important.

08:42.203 --> 08:45.923
I was drinking a '75 Dom out of
a soprano's navel. That was important.

08:46.941 --> 08:47.901
Crowley's alive.

08:51.579 --> 08:52.749
Well, you've been scooped.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.890
Cass already told me.

08:55.282 --> 08:58.742
Did Cass tell you that he is Crowley's
butt buddy, you smug little dick?

08:59.386 --> 09:01.166
- Excuse me?
- Handshake deal.

09:01.789 --> 09:03.959
Go halfsies on all the souls
of purgatory.

09:04.425 --> 09:05.595
He fill you in on that?

09:06.694 --> 09:08.304
Well, yes. Yes, of course he did. Yes.

09:08.696 --> 09:11.626
Oh, yes, of course. I...
We can read it all over your face.

09:12.199 --> 09:15.069
Look, Crowley and Cass took two
people who are very important to me.

09:15.669 --> 09:17.069
And I care about this because...?

09:17.438 --> 09:21.628
Because maybe there is a shred
of decency underneath this snarky crap.

09:24.378 --> 09:26.808
They're innocent people
and I'm asking for your help.

09:27.314 --> 09:30.004
Hmm. I see.

09:30.551 --> 09:31.481
Fair enough.

09:33.220 --> 09:34.590
Son of a bitch!

09:36.290 --> 09:38.810
Dean, let's just call Cass.
Maybe he doesn't know anything...

09:39.326 --> 09:40.696
- You're not calling Cass.
- Dean...

09:41.061 --> 09:42.051
We're not calling Cass.

09:42.763 --> 09:43.693
So, what then?

09:50.337 --> 09:55.527
You know, uh, horror, lowbrow,
put us in the ghetto, fine...

09:56.410 --> 09:59.630
but H.P. Lovecraft,
this guy is literature.

10:00.247 --> 10:01.917
I mean, he should be taught
in schools.

10:02.316 --> 10:06.566
He's up there with Dickens
and Dean R. Koontz. Seriously.

10:07.321 --> 10:09.901
Well, that's definitely the angle
I'm taking with my piece.

10:10.424 --> 10:11.354
Oh, okay. Okay.

10:11.992 --> 10:13.832
Sorry. Please.

10:16.630 --> 10:20.470
So I hear you have a large collection
of Lovecraft's private letters.

10:21.502 --> 10:22.762
Yeah.

10:23.103 --> 10:24.183
World's largest.

10:24.805 --> 10:27.145
Wow, you must be catnip
to the ladies.

10:28.676 --> 10:31.836
I'm in a long-term online relationship,
so...

10:35.282 --> 10:38.822
Well, I'd like to ask you
about, uh, Lovecraft's last years...

10:40.054 --> 10:45.384
specifically anything that might have
gone down around March 10th, 1937.

10:46.293 --> 10:48.573
Okay. Are you working on this
with the other guy?

10:49.063 --> 10:50.233
- Other guy?
- Yeah.

10:50.564 --> 10:53.194
You know, trench coat,
looks like Columbo, talks like Rain Man?

10:54.335 --> 10:55.675
Right.

10:56.570 --> 10:58.000
We're competitors.

10:59.707 --> 11:00.757
Rival magazines.

11:01.675 --> 11:05.655
Okay. Okay, well,
I'll tell you what I told him.

11:06.580 --> 11:10.180
Howard had a dinner party
on March 10th.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.358
Party?

11:12.920 --> 11:15.320
- How many friends at this party?
- Well, six.

11:15.823 --> 11:18.783
If by friends you mean co-worshippers
in a black-magic cult.

11:20.227 --> 11:23.297
They were getting together that night
to perform a ritual.

11:23.897 --> 11:24.857
Something big.

11:25.599 --> 11:26.559
Define big.

11:26.867 --> 11:29.267
Not much, just open a door
into another dimension.

11:29.803 --> 11:30.913
Why would they do that?

11:31.238 --> 11:33.138
To see what's out there.
Maybe it's friendly.

11:33.574 --> 11:35.034
It's never friendly.

11:35.909 --> 11:37.579
I mean, I imagine.

11:38.545 --> 11:40.655
So did it work? The spell?

11:41.749 --> 11:46.319
Well, uh, there was no mention of Cthulhu
in the morning papers, so...

11:47.855 --> 11:52.395
Actually, I do happen to have
several letters detailing the dinner.

11:53.193 --> 11:55.243
Worst thing that was reported
was a hangover.

11:55.829 --> 11:58.379
So it's... I've got them right here.
Some...

11:58.899 --> 12:00.329
It's actually pretty interesting.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.704
Um, and they were...

12:04.638 --> 12:06.538
They were right the...
They were right here.

12:06.974 --> 12:11.454
Well, it's not like an invisible guy
could just pop in and steal them, right?

12:12.413 --> 12:14.223
Right. Right.

12:14.648 --> 12:18.778
Oh, uh, I'll leave you to it
and you call me if you find them, huh?

12:21.555 --> 12:22.515
Okay. Hey...

12:23.390 --> 12:26.110
Thanks.
Thanks again for dropping by, huh?

12:28.295 --> 12:31.895
Lovecraft tried to jimmy a damn
dimensional door. Idiot.

12:32.566 --> 12:34.316
- So, what happened?
<i>- Well, nothing much.</i>

12:34.735 --> 12:36.815
<i>Except I dug.</i>

12:37.271 --> 12:41.581
And every guest invited to the hoedown,
dead or disappeared inside a year.

12:43.444 --> 12:45.934
Wow. Um...
So where are you off to now?

12:46.447 --> 12:48.227
<i>Have a chat with one of the guests.</i>

12:48.649 --> 12:50.229
Didn't you say everyone there died?

12:50.617 --> 12:53.047
<i>Yeah, everybody Lovecraft invited
died.</i>

12:53.754 --> 12:56.534
Seems the maid had a 9-year-old boy.
He was there.

12:57.091 --> 13:00.191
So he'd be, what, 83 years old now?
Well, where is he?

13:00.794 --> 13:03.724
Same place he's been ever since
the big night: in a mental ward.

13:04.998 --> 13:06.308
I see. Um...

13:06.667 --> 13:08.717
- Well, keep me posted, huh?
<i>- Okay. Stay in touch.</i>

13:09.169 --> 13:11.629
How's things going there?
You got a lead on Lisa and Ben?

13:12.139 --> 13:15.479
Well, we're making a few inquiries.

13:21.615 --> 13:22.695
Slow going.

13:23.016 --> 13:25.036
- How's Dean?
- About how you'd expect.

13:27.654 --> 13:28.854
Next customer.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.029
Look, I don't know anything.

13:36.230 --> 13:38.070
Yeah, we'll see.

13:44.438 --> 13:45.698
Dean?

13:47.040 --> 13:48.440
Yeah?

13:49.543 --> 13:52.583
Look, man. You're running on, what...

13:53.180 --> 13:55.430
whiskey and coffee
and whatever else you're taking.

13:55.949 --> 13:57.969
- And?
- And we're grasping at straws here, man.

13:59.887 --> 14:01.227
I kill enough of these demons...

14:01.588 --> 14:04.078
eventually one of them's gonna tell me
where Crowley is.

14:04.591 --> 14:05.881
So we good?

14:06.226 --> 14:08.446
You've been at it for a while.
Let me take over.

14:08.962 --> 14:10.362
- You deserve a break.
- No, thanks.

14:10.731 --> 14:11.751
- Dean...
- Sam, back off.

14:15.736 --> 14:20.396
Lisa and Ben, wherever they are,
that is a hundred percent on me.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.228
And if they are hurt...

14:26.780 --> 14:27.920
I'll yell if I need you.

14:47.034 --> 14:49.584
Castiel, it's Sam. Um...

14:50.103 --> 14:52.413
I don't know if you're in
on this whole Ben-Lisa thing.

14:52.906 --> 14:56.276
But if you have any heart,
whatsoever...

14:56.910 --> 14:59.600
bring them back to us, man.
Come on.

15:00.147 --> 15:01.667
Please.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.979
I'm begging you.

15:05.519 --> 15:07.629
I am begging you.
Do you understand?

15:24.238 --> 15:27.078
Sweetie, you look tense.

15:27.641 --> 15:28.661
You took Ben and Lisa?

15:28.976 --> 15:31.026
Oh, that.

15:31.645 --> 15:34.745
- I told you...
- Not to touch Sam and Dean.

15:35.349 --> 15:36.639
I've respected that.

15:36.984 --> 15:39.504
I'm merely exploiting
the obvious loophole.

15:40.053 --> 15:42.223
As long as I have the woman
and the boy...

15:42.689 --> 15:45.879
your fop-coiffed little heroes
will be scouring the Earth for them.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.940
Therefore not you and not me.

15:49.763 --> 15:51.163
Everybody wins.

15:52.266 --> 15:53.666
You should've talked to me first.

15:54.067 --> 15:56.617
I'd rather ask forgiveness
than permission. Heh, heh.

15:57.137 --> 15:58.567
Where are they, Crowley?

16:02.476 --> 16:05.876
You are not to harm them,
do you understand me?

16:06.513 --> 16:07.853
You know what?

16:08.215 --> 16:11.645
You're maxed out on putting humans
out of bounds.

16:12.286 --> 16:13.546
I'll do with them as I please.

16:15.856 --> 16:18.816
You wanna stop me?
Go find frigging purgatory!

16:26.733 --> 16:27.723
Call on the bat phone?

16:28.835 --> 16:30.705
Never call during business hours,
do they?

16:35.409 --> 16:36.669
I'll be back.

16:39.413 --> 16:42.483
Cass, Cass, Cass.
So good of you to come.

16:43.483 --> 16:44.653
Balthazar.

16:44.985 --> 16:46.625
Why did you summon me here?

16:47.020 --> 16:49.330
Can I ask you a direct question?

16:50.524 --> 16:51.894
Of course.

16:52.259 --> 16:54.889
Are you in flagrante
with the king of Hades?

16:57.264 --> 16:58.814
Of course not.

17:01.001 --> 17:02.811
Always were such a terrible liar.

17:05.137 --> 17:06.887
So it's true.

17:07.907 --> 17:09.958
All right, then. Why?

17:11.078 --> 17:12.778
It's a means to an end.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.830
Balthazar, you understand that.

17:16.249 --> 17:17.949
Oh, absolutely.

17:18.352 --> 17:19.752
But what's the end here, exactly?

17:20.153 --> 17:22.992
- Raid purgatory, snatch up all the souls?
- Win the war.

17:23.557 --> 17:26.166
And I can only assume
that you'd be the vessel, correct?

17:26.693 --> 17:28.913
Suck up all those souls into yourself.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.766
All that power.

17:32.299 --> 17:34.319
- It's the only way.
- Or too much juice for you.

17:34.768 --> 17:36.408
In which case, you explode...

17:36.803 --> 17:39.353
taking a substantial chunk
of the planet along with you.

17:39.873 --> 17:42.803
- That won't happen.
- Sure. Sure. Of course.

17:44.111 --> 17:45.811
Heh. Just...

17:46.213 --> 17:49.493
Just tell me that it's entirely risk-free.

17:51.718 --> 17:53.998
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you,
but I need to know.

17:54.821 --> 17:56.691
Are you with me or not?

18:06.233 --> 18:11.033
You know, you may be certifiable,
but fine.

18:12.773 --> 18:14.703
In for a penny...

18:15.242 --> 18:16.532
in for a pound.

18:20.113 --> 18:23.213
- How'd you hear about this anyway?
- Oh, your howler monkeys, of course.

18:23.817 --> 18:27.717
See, they're just a touch worked up
about that kidnapping business.

18:34.327 --> 18:37.227
You're sure you're not
with that other reporter?

18:37.798 --> 18:38.698
In the coat?

18:40.934 --> 18:44.744
Liar, that one, not who he says.

18:45.639 --> 18:46.719
No, sir.

18:47.040 --> 18:51.490
Uh, I'm not affiliated with his paper.

18:52.279 --> 18:56.439
I just have a couple of questions
about a dinner party you were at in 1937.

18:58.385 --> 19:01.405
Everyone's so fascinated.

19:01.988 --> 19:07.818
Wanna know about my night
at the home of the great H.P. Lovecraft?

19:09.463 --> 19:10.543
If you don't mind.

19:10.864 --> 19:12.094
Well, you know the story.

19:12.632 --> 19:17.322
They did their spell
and they all said it failed.

19:21.174 --> 19:23.044
Do you believe in monsters?

19:24.177 --> 19:25.637
Yup.

19:28.181 --> 19:32.781
You know, you go saying that,
they'll lock you in here rest of your life.

19:33.587 --> 19:35.517
Whatever you saw...

19:36.189 --> 19:38.119
you tell me and I'll buy it straight.

19:41.795 --> 19:43.315
The spell worked.

19:44.397 --> 19:48.207
A door opened
and something came through.

19:48.902 --> 19:53.262
But it was invisible, so no one knew.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.270
Except me.

19:56.443 --> 19:57.433
How did you know, then?

19:57.744 --> 19:59.174
Because it took my mother.

20:00.747 --> 20:02.087
It went into her.

20:02.449 --> 20:03.709
She wasn't the same.

20:04.050 --> 20:06.510
She even smelled different.

20:07.854 --> 20:11.134
And then she disappeared.

20:13.193 --> 20:19.283
And surprise, surprise,
one by one, they all start dying.

20:23.737 --> 20:25.077
I'm sorry...

20:25.438 --> 20:26.608
about your mom.

20:30.110 --> 20:34.300
You're the first person ever said that.

20:38.151 --> 20:40.641
Hey, you wanna see a picture?

20:41.221 --> 20:42.651
Mm-hm.

20:56.970 --> 20:58.460
I'll be damned.

21:09.649 --> 21:11.789
I promise you, pal...

21:13.453 --> 21:15.063
you start talking...

21:16.389 --> 21:19.929
or I swear, I will rip your skin off.

21:20.594 --> 21:23.874
Strip by strip.

21:24.764 --> 21:26.754
And then I'm gonna kill you.

21:28.702 --> 21:30.692
And then I'm gonna do it
to the next demon.

21:31.137 --> 21:32.507
Do you hear me?

21:32.906 --> 21:33.866
Yeah.

21:36.209 --> 21:37.609
I hear you.

21:43.416 --> 21:46.846
So you can stop talking,
you miserable sack.

22:07.898 --> 22:09.328
I didn't ask for your help.

22:11.035 --> 22:12.995
Well, regardless. You're welcome.

22:14.171 --> 22:15.951
Why are you here?

22:18.876 --> 22:21.916
I had no idea Crowley
would take Lisa and Ben.

22:22.813 --> 22:24.423
Yeah, right.

22:28.052 --> 22:31.242
- You don't believe me.
- I don't believe a word out of your mouth.

22:35.860 --> 22:38.320
I thought you said
that we were like family.

22:38.829 --> 22:40.319
Well, I think that too.

22:40.698 --> 22:43.358
- Shouldn't trust run both ways?
- Cass, I just can't.

22:43.901 --> 22:47.591
Dean, I do everything that you ask.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.276
I always come when you call.

22:50.608 --> 22:52.188
And I am your friend.

22:52.576 --> 22:56.796
Still, despite your lack of faith in me
and now your threats...

22:59.350 --> 23:02.040
I just saved you, yet again.

23:02.586 --> 23:05.546
Has anyone but your closest kin
ever done more for you?

23:07.024 --> 23:08.284
All I ask is this one thing.

23:08.626 --> 23:11.816
- Trust your plan to pop purgatory?
- I've earned that, Dean.

23:16.867 --> 23:18.977
I came to tell you
that I will find Lisa and Ben.

23:19.437 --> 23:21.487
And I will bring them back.

23:22.740 --> 23:25.050
Stand behind me...

23:25.743 --> 23:27.613
the one time I ask.

23:30.481 --> 23:32.591
- You're asking me to stand down?
- Dean...

23:33.050 --> 23:36.010
That's the same damn ransom note
that Crowley handed me.

23:36.587 --> 23:38.197
You know that, right?

23:39.357 --> 23:40.647
Well, no, thanks.

23:40.991 --> 23:42.101
I'll find them myself.

23:43.728 --> 23:46.948
Go back to Crowley and tell him
that I said you can both kiss my ass.

24:19.096 --> 24:20.356
Bobby?

24:20.698 --> 24:21.988
Ellie.

24:22.333 --> 24:23.533
It's been a while.

24:25.970 --> 24:27.340
Come in.

24:34.645 --> 24:37.635
So how did you find me?

24:38.416 --> 24:43.456
Well, we weren't together long, Ellie,
but I know a thing or two about you.

24:44.321 --> 24:46.071
I know your safe houses.

24:46.490 --> 24:49.770
And let me tell you,
this one ain't all that safe.

24:50.428 --> 24:54.618
So did you come here just to, um, chat?

25:00.704 --> 25:01.874
I know what you are, Ellie.

25:08.746 --> 25:11.876
You're not exactly from Milwaukee,
are you?

25:12.683 --> 25:13.673
Not exactly.

25:14.752 --> 25:20.142
And not that I'd have minded, but you
kind of fibbed about your age too.

25:21.325 --> 25:23.105
Just slightly.

25:24.462 --> 25:26.682
Nine hundred years.

25:28.098 --> 25:29.388
So, what's your game, then?

25:30.067 --> 25:31.617
- Game?
- Yeah. Why are you here?

25:32.236 --> 25:34.406
Eve came through
and raised all kinds of hell.

25:34.872 --> 25:37.242
You've been here how long?
What's with the slow burn?

25:37.741 --> 25:40.901
- Well, you know, we're not all alike.
- Monsters?

25:41.512 --> 25:44.732
- If you feel better calling me that, fine.
- You're from freaking purgatory.

25:45.349 --> 25:49.099
You never thought to mention that
the whole time you slept with me?

25:52.022 --> 25:54.242
I am what I am, Bobby.

25:54.725 --> 25:57.245
- And I happen to be a friend.
- You wanna explain that to me?

25:58.095 --> 25:59.965
I didn't ask those idiots
to crack the door.

26:00.397 --> 26:01.857
I was the thing that fell through.

26:02.233 --> 26:04.343
Let me tell you something,
you're lucky it was me.

26:04.802 --> 26:07.142
- You're saying you're on our side?
- I'm on my side.

26:07.638 --> 26:09.478
I happen to like it here.

26:09.907 --> 26:12.687
I don't wanna see this place turned
into some bloody wasteland.

26:14.411 --> 26:16.161
So you killed H.P. Lovecraft.

26:16.580 --> 26:19.040
Please. That guy
couldn't even write "hello."

26:20.584 --> 26:23.684
I have spent 75 years trying
to keep purgatory closed.

26:24.288 --> 26:25.988
Why do you think I gave Dean
the sword?

26:27.591 --> 26:30.551
To stop Eve. Hell, you guys
were supposed to kill the damn dragons.

26:31.128 --> 26:34.968
Look, this all comes down
to one angel.

26:35.666 --> 26:38.186
He wants purgatory
and he's looking for you.

26:40.604 --> 26:41.894
Well, thanks for the heads-up.

26:42.907 --> 26:43.837
I know him, El.

26:44.441 --> 26:46.661
He's gonna figure it out
one way or another.

26:47.144 --> 26:50.164
Now, the only way I can stop him
is to get ahead of him.

26:50.748 --> 26:52.938
So I need to know
how you open the door.

26:53.417 --> 26:55.117
No. No, Bobby.

26:55.553 --> 26:57.283
It's too dangerous
for anyone to know.

26:57.688 --> 27:00.318
If I found you, he ain't far behind.

27:01.992 --> 27:05.302
At least let me take you somewhere,
protect you.

27:08.132 --> 27:10.182
No. Thanks.

27:11.569 --> 27:15.079
I have a couple other places lined up.
Don't worry.

27:16.307 --> 27:17.977
Bobby...

27:18.375 --> 27:19.365
you're just a man.

27:21.679 --> 27:23.609
I'm better off protecting myself.

27:34.725 --> 27:35.925
Drinking your feelings, Sam?

27:36.827 --> 27:39.197
I thought that was your brother's bag.

27:40.297 --> 27:41.467
Stressful times.

27:42.132 --> 27:43.182
Well, we need to talk.

27:44.101 --> 27:45.241
Why?

27:45.603 --> 27:47.713
Because... I know I'm gonna live
to regret this...

27:49.840 --> 27:51.890
but I'm officially on your team.

27:53.510 --> 27:54.560
You bastards.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.670
And we should believe you why?

27:59.683 --> 28:01.463
Would you believe
I had a shred of decency?

28:01.885 --> 28:03.875
- No.
- Oh, that hurts.

28:05.356 --> 28:06.816
Okay, you're right. It's survival.

28:07.691 --> 28:11.761
You see, I asked Cass some questions
and I disliked his answers.

28:12.496 --> 28:15.566
He seems sure of himself for a man
who wants to swallow nuclear reactors.

28:16.166 --> 28:19.126
I mean, these things can get
a bit Chernobyl, you know?

28:20.571 --> 28:23.001
So voilà.

28:23.741 --> 28:25.291
Consider me your double agent.

28:25.909 --> 28:28.369
Oh, and I took the liberty of searching
for your friends.

28:28.879 --> 28:30.809
Uh, took a while. Crowley's a clever one.

28:31.248 --> 28:32.648
You found them?

28:33.017 --> 28:34.067
The upside is, yes.

28:34.652 --> 28:37.112
The downside is, no,
I can't get them for you.

28:37.655 --> 28:39.525
- Why not?
- Because Crowley's angel-proofed...

28:39.957 --> 28:43.177
the whole bloody building.
I guess he doesn't trust Cass.

28:43.794 --> 28:45.374
That marriage is going swimmingly.

28:45.763 --> 28:47.783
- Okay, well, get us as close as you can.
- Sure.

28:49.366 --> 28:50.886
But then you're on your own.

28:58.876 --> 29:01.946
All right, boys, this is where I get off.

29:02.546 --> 29:05.126
God be with you and what have you.

29:37.981 --> 29:39.711
All right, be careful.

31:33.897 --> 31:35.037
Oh, Dean. Thank God.

31:35.365 --> 31:37.555
Still gotta get you out of here.

31:38.368 --> 31:40.098
Okay. Okay.

31:40.838 --> 31:42.708
All right. Come on. Come on. Let's go.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.170
The brat's not going anywhere.

31:45.576 --> 31:47.216
And neither am I.

31:54.775 --> 31:56.355
Crowley thought you might come.

31:56.743 --> 32:00.203
So he had me jump this hot little piece
of ass for insurance.

32:00.848 --> 32:03.458
Can't go losing our leverage, now,
can we?

32:04.017 --> 32:05.477
Ah, another step...

32:06.687 --> 32:08.267
free appendectomy.

32:10.123 --> 32:12.643
You know, she's awake in here,
your mom.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.180
I can hear her thinking.

32:14.494 --> 32:15.984
- Don't listen to her, Ben.
- What?

32:16.363 --> 32:19.053
I was just gonna tell him
that you're his real daddy.

32:22.269 --> 32:24.929
Just kidding.
Who knows who your real dad is, kid.

32:25.472 --> 32:27.202
- Your mom's a slut.
- You shut your mouth.

32:27.608 --> 32:31.358
Oh, what? You're her white knight now?
She wishes she never met you, Dean.

32:32.079 --> 32:34.629
You're the worst mistake
she ever made.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.820
Second worst, after keeping you.

32:39.286 --> 32:41.396
That's not your mom, Ben.
She's lying.

32:41.855 --> 32:45.365
Says the C-minus lay
with 10 miles of daddy issues.

32:46.026 --> 32:48.196
Whatever gets you through the night,
Tiny Tim. Ah, ah.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.442
Back off, cowboy.

32:51.131 --> 32:53.561
You know,
she's begging me to kill you.

32:54.101 --> 32:55.301
She says you hold her back.

32:57.037 --> 32:59.057
Never had a lick of fun
since you were born.

32:59.506 --> 33:01.616
Ben, look at me. Look at me.

33:02.109 --> 33:03.599
You're gonna be just fine.

33:05.178 --> 33:06.518
- Ah!
- Go.

33:10.651 --> 33:11.731
Ben, knife.

33:13.253 --> 33:14.833
What's the matter, Dean? Hit me.

33:16.123 --> 33:18.933
Oh, you don't wanna hurt poor Lisa?
Ha, ha.

33:23.063 --> 33:23.993
Shut your mouth.

33:42.416 --> 33:43.996
Stop it. I'm warning you.

33:44.384 --> 33:46.284
You can go to hell,
you black-eyed bitch.

33:48.388 --> 33:49.318
You sure about that?

33:51.158 --> 33:52.498
- Mom.
- Ha-ha-ha.

33:55.595 --> 33:59.435
Exorcise me now.
She's just a dead meatsuit.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.037
Now, what was it you wanted to say?

34:25.458 --> 34:26.569
- Mom.
- Lisa.

34:27.127 --> 34:28.496
Lisa.

34:29.730 --> 34:32.280
Here, put pressure on that, okay?
I know, honey. I know.

34:34.735 --> 34:36.844
- It's okay. It's okay.
<i>- This is Sam.</i>

34:37.304 --> 34:38.204
<i>Leave a message.</i>

34:38.505 --> 34:40.315
Sam, where are you, damn it?

34:40.741 --> 34:43.400
All right, Ben.
We gotta get her out of here, okay? Ben.

34:43.944 --> 34:46.784
Ben? Ben. Hey.

34:47.347 --> 34:49.077
Listen. Pull it together. Be strong.

34:49.483 --> 34:52.553
Your mom needs you. Go over
in that duffel bag. Grab the salt gun.

34:53.152 --> 34:56.193
I gotta carry your mom out,
so if anything comes at us, you shoot it.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.050
Go. Now.

35:03.330 --> 35:05.230
Okay. Get the knife. Get the knife.

35:07.434 --> 35:08.364
All right, Ben.

35:08.668 --> 35:12.298
Keep your elbow in, gun tight
to your shoulder and watch for the kick.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.670
Ben.

35:18.612 --> 35:20.982
- Ben. Ben.
- Dean.

35:21.481 --> 35:24.671
Come on. Pull it together.
You want your mom to die? Let's go.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.460
Come on.

35:41.802 --> 35:43.172
- Dean.
- Sam?

35:43.537 --> 35:44.877
I'm in here.

35:50.377 --> 35:52.127
- Come on.
- We gotta get to a hospital. Ben.

35:52.546 --> 35:53.446
Give the gun to him.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.210
Sam, we need a ride.

35:55.682 --> 35:57.022
Yeah.

36:03.423 --> 36:04.443
Go, go, go.

36:16.837 --> 36:18.647
She's fine, Ben.
She's gonna be just fine.

36:19.072 --> 36:21.122
We're almost there.
Hey. Hey. Hey. Stay with me.

36:21.575 --> 36:23.415
Sam, you gotta go faster, man.

36:23.844 --> 36:25.894
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be just fine.

36:43.526 --> 36:44.456
Ben, I'm sorry.

36:48.564 --> 36:49.994
Ben.

36:54.737 --> 36:55.877
What do you want?

36:57.006 --> 36:58.816
- Dean, listen.
- What do you want me to say?

37:01.377 --> 37:03.397
She'll be dead by midnight.

37:04.380 --> 37:06.900
- I'm sorry.
- I don't care.

37:10.119 --> 37:11.819
It's too little, too late.

37:12.989 --> 37:14.329
Okay.

37:15.758 --> 37:17.508
Well, regardless,
I didn't come for you.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.851
Meaning?

37:33.109 --> 37:34.979
She's fine now.

37:36.646 --> 37:38.516
She'll wake soon.

37:42.618 --> 37:45.368
Dean, I said I'm sorry and I meant it.

37:49.792 --> 37:51.312
Thank you.

37:54.130 --> 37:56.150
I wish this changed anything.

37:56.966 --> 37:58.366
I know.

37:59.168 --> 38:00.808
So do I.

38:02.071 --> 38:05.061
All else aside,
I just wanted to fix what I could.

38:07.476 --> 38:09.846
There's one more thing
you could do for me.

38:20.489 --> 38:22.679
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

38:23.159 --> 38:25.619
- What...?
- You're in the hospital.

38:26.462 --> 38:28.712
- What happened?
- We were in a car crash.

38:29.198 --> 38:30.948
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

38:31.834 --> 38:35.174
You hit your head pretty bad,
but you're okay now.

38:42.511 --> 38:43.911
Hi.

38:49.485 --> 38:50.915
Who are you?

38:53.389 --> 38:54.649
Uh, I'm Dean.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.810
Uh...

38:59.362 --> 39:00.622
The guy who hit you.

39:03.399 --> 39:04.299
Oh.

39:05.334 --> 39:06.764
I just, uh...

39:08.604 --> 39:10.744
I lost control for a minute.

39:12.675 --> 39:15.255
And I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.880
But I'm real happy you two
are both okay.

39:22.385 --> 39:23.585
And, uh...

39:26.255 --> 39:28.945
I'm just... I'm glad your life can get back
to normal now.

39:33.262 --> 39:35.602
We're okay, so...

39:36.132 --> 39:38.532
So that's what's important, right?

39:43.539 --> 39:44.879
Yeah.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.743
Anyway...

39:50.680 --> 39:52.170
I'll leave you two alone.

39:56.185 --> 39:57.265
You take care of your mom.

40:28.451 --> 40:31.411
- Well?
- Well, nothing.

40:40.696 --> 40:42.716
Dean, you have pulled
some shady crap before...

40:43.199 --> 40:45.749
but this has got to be the worst.

40:47.103 --> 40:49.733
Whitewashing their memories?
Take it from somebody who knows...

40:50.272 --> 40:53.812
If you ever mention Lisa or Ben
to me again, I will break your nose.

40:57.346 --> 40:59.366
- Dean...
- I'm not kidding.
