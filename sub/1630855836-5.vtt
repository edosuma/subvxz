00:02.136 --> 00:03.068
- I haven't been with anyone
since my surgery.

00:03.203 --> 00:04.236
- You're so beautiful, hayley.

00:04.305 --> 00:06.238
- It was an impossible
exercise. It was designed

00:06.240 --> 00:08.240
To test how'd you respond
when there is no solution.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.775
It was just a simulation.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.243
- Chopper...
- If I'm not the guy

00:11.312 --> 00:13.678
Who can solve every problem.
- I'm putting you solo

00:13.748 --> 00:15.380
On the 200 for cargo routes.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.816
- May I catch a lift
with you to prospect river?

00:17.852 --> 00:20.452
- Oh! I know I made
a mistake, sir, but--

00:20.454 --> 00:23.222
- I went to bat for you, lexi.
I pushed for you to be promoted.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.257
- I'm sorry, sir.
I want to go back to medevacs.

00:25.392 --> 00:28.026
- I guess you're not the pilot
that I thought you were.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.731
(baby crying)
- he's normally so happy.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.533
- Aw. Don't feel bad, simon.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.401
Nowak brings that
out in people.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.936
- Babies love me.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.072
- This bug's done
a number on both of us.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.873
Can you take him for a minute?

00:41.909 --> 00:44.143
- We're just waiting
on a new f.O.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.978
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.749
- Lex. What the f.O.?
- I'm back on medevacs.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.152
- Why?
You were captain on cargo.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.653
- I didn't like flying alone.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.388
Besides, medevacs
are more interesting.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.156
I like the patients.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.758
- Yeah, but you needed the pic
hours to go to a major airline.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.661
- I can still get pic hours
on medevac.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.497
- In twice the time.
Lex, this doesn't make sense.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.565
I know how hard you must have
worked to get to captain.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.568
No one gives that up.
- Can you just drop it?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.170
Let it go.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.571
- Fine.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.838
For the record,
I don't approve.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.674
(baby crying)
- I'm going to be sick.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.409
- Lex, some help.
- Okay, I got you.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.012
- Hang on a sec, bethany.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.314
(retching)
that's good, let it out.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.118
- Just this...
(liquid oozing)

01:26.187 --> 01:27.752
- Oh!

01:29.056 --> 01:32.591
(baby crying)

01:32.593 --> 01:34.392
- You'll be alright.
We'll be out of here soon.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.961
- You gave up captain
for this.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.604
- I can feel you staring,
you weirdo.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.173
- Well, it is a very nice back.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.275
Does it go all the way down?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.444
- You're lucky
you're a cute weirdo.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.019
- Mmm, this is fun.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.621
- Mm-hmm. I think
that's why people do it.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.689
- No, no.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.558
This is fun,
hanging out with you.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.826
- This is fun.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.431
- Listen, um...

02:13.767 --> 02:15.700
You're not a pilot
and I'm not your boss.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.869
- Mm-hmm.
- But the way the news

02:17.938 --> 02:20.038
Moves in this house...

02:20.074 --> 02:22.507
- Do you think we could just
keep this between us for now?

02:22.543 --> 02:24.309
- Mm-hmm.
- It's just nice.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.980
Having something fun
that's just for us.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.548
Yeah?

02:29.617 --> 02:31.116
- Yeah.

02:31.251 --> 02:34.052
Since we're both off,
and we have this big comfy bed.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.753
- Mm-hmm.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.059
(beeping)

02:42.196 --> 02:44.195
Well, at least I thought
that you were off.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.064
- It's an emergency alert.
Thompson community

02:46.066 --> 02:48.066
Can't staff the er tonight.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.534
They're calling
all the flight nurses

02:49.570 --> 02:51.002
To try to keep it open.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.705
- Discharge anyone
well enough to go home.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.406
Free up beds and nurses.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.141
Anything that is urgent,
get it on a medevac

02:57.178 --> 02:58.477
To another hospital.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.479
Skymed nurses will help
keep the er open,

03:00.614 --> 03:02.748
But we're at reduced capacity
and there's no or.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.017
So anything that needs surgery
has to be medevacked.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.486
We have volunteers
filling in for psws.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.887
Dr. Yana is unfortunately
away at a conference.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.690
She'll be grabbing
the first flight back tomorrow,

03:11.825 --> 03:13.191
But for the next 12 hours,

03:13.260 --> 03:15.493
I will be the only
er doctor in thompson.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.162
Crystal is not just
a med student,

03:17.231 --> 03:19.164
She's also a nurse practitioner.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.366
She can handle prescriptions,
stitches, referrals.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.068
Let's go, people!

03:24.705 --> 03:27.338
(tense music)

03:36.717 --> 03:41.152
(overlapping chatter)

03:43.090 --> 03:44.456
- They're short-staffed.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.124
I don't want you to waste
your last night

03:46.193 --> 03:47.659
At home at a hospital.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.527
- Mom, you're in pain.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.329
Besides, it wouldn't be any fun
beating you at skip-bo

03:51.465 --> 03:52.897
If you're too sick
to even cheat.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.532
- I don't cheat.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.568
Much...

03:56.703 --> 03:58.270
But we'll be here forever
waiting for help.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.805
- Never afraid, always brave!

04:00.841 --> 04:03.875
Super sam will save the day!

04:03.877 --> 04:05.576
- Whoa!
(gasps)

04:06.747 --> 04:08.447
- How'd you do that?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.015
- My daughter's a superhero,
too.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.883
(gasps)
you see those?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.751
That's her cape.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.887
- Is that how you get
superpowers?

04:15.889 --> 04:17.222
Is that how you caught me?

04:17.224 --> 04:19.090
- No, that was just reflex.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.559
It's when you practice
something so much

04:21.595 --> 04:23.295
It becomes second nature.
- In the comic books,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.430
Super sam needs super juice
to get powers.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.433
- That would have saved me
a lot of push-ups in basic.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.703
- Oh, mia, there you are.
I'm so sorry.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.571
They're like little houdinis
at this age.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.309
- This needs to go to the lab,
and crystal needs to write

04:37.311 --> 04:39.845
The patient a script in case
it comes back positive.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.781
Thanks for volunteering tonight.
- I wanted to feel useful.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.051
And... I could use some time
away from the plane.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.920
- Said no pilot ever.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.922
When you told nowak
you didn't want to fly alone--

04:50.924 --> 04:53.191
- Yeah, I'm not sure
how urgent this patient is.

04:53.227 --> 04:55.193
But if I had my thumbs stuck
in one of those,

04:55.262 --> 04:56.762
I'd want it out.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.197
- Yeah...

05:00.400 --> 05:01.933
- Hey, stef just called.
She's bringing in

05:02.069 --> 05:03.868
A cardiac patient, eta 2200.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.470
(phone dings)

05:10.277 --> 05:11.743
(chuckles)

05:12.913 --> 05:14.579
(groans)

05:14.715 --> 05:17.281
- I know.
Ascites is painful.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.618
- I've had it drained
a few times.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.253
- We came in a couple
of days ago,

05:21.388 --> 05:22.821
But she's already really
swollen again.

05:22.956 --> 05:26.291
- When the liver fails,
fluid can build up fast.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.959
Are you taking anything
for the pain?

05:27.961 --> 05:29.861
- I'm five months sober.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.296
One more month,
and I'm eligible

05:31.431 --> 05:33.631
For a transplant.
- She needs a doctor.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.300
Please.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.702
She might not have
another month.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.671
I-I know you guys
are short staffed

05:39.673 --> 05:41.539
But if a doctor could
drain it...

05:41.575 --> 05:42.974
I redeploy tomorrow.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.276
I'd really hate to leave
her like this.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.778
- You've been overseas?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.780
- Whole time
she's been sick.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.248
- Let me see what I can do.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.517
Why don't you wait
down the hall for the doctor?

05:52.586 --> 05:54.485
- Thank you.
- Second door on the left.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.455
- Okay.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.756
(rhythmic music)

06:04.531 --> 06:06.330
- Hot date?

06:07.101 --> 06:08.867
- Our endocrinology grades

06:08.869 --> 06:10.335
Are supposed
to be posted tonight.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.138
Between work and school,
I barely got to study.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.707
- Hmm. Um, stef's bringing in

06:15.709 --> 06:18.410
A suspected aicd malfunction
in about half an hour.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.145
- Okay, what else you got?

06:20.280 --> 06:21.946
- There's a foot laceration
in bay three,

06:21.982 --> 06:23.815
He needs sutures.
- Okay, switch.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.085
- There's a patient in bay one
that's all set up

06:27.220 --> 06:29.421
For iv and antibiotics.
You just start it.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.156
And there's a boil that needs
to be lanced in bay two.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.692
He's pretty nervous,
so I just prepped midazolam.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.227
- Got it. And there's
a liver patient

06:35.229 --> 06:37.028
In the trauma room with ascites.
She doesn't look good

06:37.030 --> 06:38.430
And her daughter's
really worried.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.632
I know you can't drain it,
but she's in a lot of pain.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.235
- Yeah, I'll see what I can do
until dr. Paul... Whoa!

06:43.370 --> 06:45.904
This is not my phone.
I don't know who cute weirdo is

06:45.973 --> 06:48.139
But good for him?
- Oh, crap.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.343
- Okay, I guess
good for you.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.277
Wait are you seeing someone?

06:54.381 --> 06:55.813
Hayley!

06:55.849 --> 06:58.316
- Okay, I was going to tell you,
but it's just really new

06:58.385 --> 06:59.984
And we're sort of trying
to figure it out.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.953
(phone dings)
oh, look!

07:02.022 --> 07:03.621
Your endocrinology results.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.127
Is everything okay?

07:10.164 --> 07:11.730
- Yeah, I'll deal
with the ascites.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.132
You go prep the boil patient
with midazolam.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.867
- Okay.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.537
- Hang in there, mom.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.406
- Miss jenkins?

07:22.443 --> 07:24.342
- Are you here to drain
her ascites?

07:24.344 --> 07:26.344
- Ah, yes.
I'm here to have a look.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.280
- Finally, a doctor.

07:29.583 --> 07:33.018
- Oh, shoot. Sorry.
I will be back in one second.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.753
I just have to go
and give this to--

07:34.755 --> 07:36.020
- Yeah, sorry.
I've been waiting all night

07:36.056 --> 07:37.022
To get a doctor in here.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.090
I'm on a bit of a timeline,
so...

07:39.126 --> 07:41.025
- Kyla!
What are you doing?

07:41.094 --> 07:42.961
- Whoa, okay.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.764
I'm not a doctor,
I'm a medical student.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.600
- Well, that's unfortunate.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.070
Guess I'm going to need you
to get a real one in here then.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.941
- We'll get you a splint
and we'll send you to x-ray.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.309
- Okay, hang on.
- Dr. Paul.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.844
The boil patient is ready
for lancing.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.513
- Alright, meet me
in five minutes to assist.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.249
(gentle music)

08:04.318 --> 08:05.784
(sighs)

08:12.926 --> 08:14.358
Shit.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.531
- So you need to clean
the area three times a day.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.934
Apply this antibiotic
ointment.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.336
And if it gets red again
or it looks infected,

08:25.372 --> 08:27.371
You follow up with
your family doctor, okay?

08:32.179 --> 08:35.146
- Dr. Paul, I...
I know you're busy tonight,

08:35.182 --> 08:37.282
But is there any chance
you could just write me

08:37.284 --> 08:39.451
A quick prescription?
My surgeon prescribed it

08:39.453 --> 08:40.886
After my mastectomy.
But you know,

08:41.021 --> 08:42.821
I got busy with work
and I forgot

08:42.956 --> 08:44.222
To get him to refill it.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.491
- It's roberts with an s?
- Mm-hmm.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.293
- Your, um...

08:48.362 --> 08:49.894
Surgery was a while ago?

08:50.730 --> 08:52.297
- Six months.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.698
- If you're still
having pain

08:53.833 --> 08:55.834
And your current prescription
isn't managing it,

08:55.836 --> 08:57.769
You should talk to your surgeon.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.305
It should be improving
by now, and...

09:00.307 --> 09:01.840
Can't be too careful
with narcotics.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.341
- Right.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.110
Yeah, it's just my surgeon
in winnipeg,

09:06.146 --> 09:08.179
He has a waitlist, so...

09:08.215 --> 09:09.847
- Have you tried
other therapies?

09:09.849 --> 09:11.116
Exercise, massage?

09:11.118 --> 09:12.784
They're often better
at addressing the cause

09:12.853 --> 09:14.786
Instead of just masking
symptoms.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.055
- Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I'll try those.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.589
Thanks.

09:21.861 --> 09:23.995
<i> (crystal over pa system):</i>
<i> Dr. Yana to trauma room one.</i>

09:24.031 --> 09:26.397
<i> Dr. Yana to trauma room one.</i>

09:28.302 --> 09:30.935
- Crystal? Crystal,
you know dr. Yana's

09:30.938 --> 09:32.804
Not back until tomorrow.
Do you...

09:32.873 --> 09:34.205
- Really?

09:35.475 --> 09:37.475
- Holy crap.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.844
- So I guess dr. Yana
won't be joining us then?

09:39.846 --> 09:41.946
- Kyla...
What's happening?

09:42.015 --> 09:44.615
You don't need a gun
to get your mom help.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.951
- But I do need one
to get her a liver.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.153
- Kyla,

09:48.288 --> 09:51.156
I qualify for a transplant
in a month.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.157
- If there's a liver
available.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.959
If you survive that long.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.096
I'm sorry, mom.
But it's now or never.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.597
- We're understaffed tonight.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.933
The or isn't even open.
There's no surgeons.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.235
- No innocent bystanders
to get hurt.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.637
It's not ideal,
but I've seen medics

10:05.772 --> 10:07.839
Do a lot more in the field
with a lot less.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.708
- Look, kyla...

10:09.710 --> 10:11.175
- I appreciate that
you were trying

10:11.244 --> 10:12.844
To protect your team.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.713
But I need you to call
an actual doctor in here now.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.782
I need you to slide over
your cell phone.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.384
(tense music)

10:25.058 --> 10:26.658
(hayley): Okay, kyla.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.361
Crys, now!

10:30.397 --> 10:31.796
- Hey!

10:31.798 --> 10:33.631
No!
(gunshot)

10:34.267 --> 10:35.567
- Crystal!

10:41.741 --> 10:43.274
- Look, kyla.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.510
- I appreciate that you were
trying to protect your team.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.913
But I need you to call
an actual doctor in here now.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.615
- Want to see if we can
get some air?

10:50.684 --> 10:51.749
(laughing)

10:53.420 --> 10:54.685
- Is that super sam?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.188
- Terrific tristan!

10:57.190 --> 10:58.623
- Marvelous mia!

10:58.758 --> 11:00.524
You're growing so fast
I thought you were super sam.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.826
- We didn't expect
to see you here.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.228
- Skymed nurses
are helping out

11:03.230 --> 11:04.562
The hospital tonight.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.964
Mia lets me be her sidekick

11:06.099 --> 11:07.732
When she takes
a medevac to winnipeg.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.700
- You are her favourite
flight nurse.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.502
- Don't tell the others.
- Oh, I'm gonna tell them.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.171
(laughing)

11:13.240 --> 11:14.772
It's been a couple of weeks.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.475
I'd hope you'd solve
the mystery illness.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.977
- We were at my parent's house,
she was fine there.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.847
No vomiting, no nausea.
But when we got back...

11:22.883 --> 11:25.316
- I barfed. A lot.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.585
- I changed detergents
and our cleaning products.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.120
I got rid of all the plants.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.855
We've been following the diet
the pediatrician gave us.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.658
Look, I hate putting her
through all these tests

11:33.793 --> 11:35.059
Every time we go to winnipeg.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.261
- Don't worry, dad.
I can handle it.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.930
Super sam isn't scared
of anything.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.331
- Yeah!

11:40.333 --> 11:42.433
-<i> Code silver in</i>
<i> the emergency room.</i>

11:42.502 --> 11:44.335
<i> All patients and staff</i>
<i> shelter in place.</i>

11:44.471 --> 11:47.204
- What's a "code silver?"
- violent patient with a weapon.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.873
(gunshot)

11:49.008 --> 11:50.708
In here!

11:50.744 --> 11:52.944
Clear the halls!
Take cover!

11:52.946 --> 11:54.712
Lock the doors!
Take cover!

11:54.748 --> 11:56.547
(alarm blaring)
keep an eye on the patient.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.949
- Yeah.
Hey, mia, how you doing?

11:58.985 --> 12:00.718
I know that was kind of scary.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.753
- Never afraid, always brave.

12:02.789 --> 12:05.790
Super sam
will save the day.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.358
- Not this time, bud, okay?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.193
We need to let the real
heroes handle this.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.362
- But I am a real hero.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.031
- I know! I know, mia, but...

12:14.101 --> 12:16.567
We have to stay here
and be quiet. Okay?

12:16.603 --> 12:19.237
- But there's a bad guy, right?
I can stop him.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.339
Heroes help!
- You know what, mia?

12:21.341 --> 12:23.742
Why don't you help your dad
build a superhero fortress

12:23.877 --> 12:26.778
Under the bed here?
- Hey, that's a great idea.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.580
Just like super sam's
hero cave in the books.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.915
We can use these blankets. Here.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.452
- Anything?
- Crystal and hayley
aren't answering.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.054
- You think they're okay?

12:36.189 --> 12:37.789
- I'm not getting through
to the hospital security,

12:37.791 --> 12:39.891
Or the police.
- They must know
what's going on.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.459
- You know the police
are almost as understaffed

12:41.594 --> 12:43.194
As the health care workers
up here.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.798
We just need to sit tight,
keep the doors locked,

12:46.800 --> 12:48.399
And our patients safe.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.767
- Okay.
- Okay, guys.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.237
- Who opened the door?
- Mia?

12:53.306 --> 12:55.740
- Stop! It's not safe.
- That's my daughter out there.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.876
- But it's dark
and you don't know the hospital.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.245
- And you getting hurt
won't help mia.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.280
- You need to stay here
in case she comes back.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.816
- We'll find her.
I'm coming, too.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.417
- Alright, we got this.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.085
C'mon, let's go.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.620
- Lock it.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.889
(tense music)

13:14.194 --> 13:18.096
- Dispatch, this is 933.
Eta to thompson, 20 minutes.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.697
- I'm usually a thompson ten.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.666
I'm a little worse for wear

13:21.735 --> 13:24.869
Since my fancy new pacemaker
started acting up.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.270
- It's an aicd.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.039
Implantable cardioverter
defibrillator.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.509
Fancy pacemaker.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.378
- I thought it was
the palpations

13:33.380 --> 13:36.047
From shoveling the drive
for my hubby.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.849
Snow in April.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.151
Things we do for love.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.487
- Hey, stef,
dispatch just called.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.022
Thompson community's
on redirect.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.823
- Oh, must be
the staffing issue.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.225
Looks like we're heading
to winnipeg.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.260
- What do you say, cap?
- We can make it.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.896
- So, this love
that brought you up here,

13:51.898 --> 13:53.998
Is it worth it?
(chuckles)

13:54.034 --> 13:55.800
- Normand's always worth it.

13:55.935 --> 13:58.002
We were high school sweethearts.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.805
But we had to hide it
for a long time.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.008
That must sound strange
for your generation.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.078
- Yeah.
My dad took me to a jays game

14:07.080 --> 14:08.479
When I was seven.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.081
I took a flyball
to the shoulder

14:10.083 --> 14:12.083
And fought off a grown man
for the ball.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.752
Dad said he knew then.

14:14.888 --> 14:18.022
Uh, guess that was kind of that,
actually.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.893
- When we first moved
to thompson,

14:21.895 --> 14:24.762
The pride parade was any time
I went for a walk.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.731
(laughing)

14:26.733 --> 14:28.066
It's better now.

14:28.068 --> 14:31.135
But of all the places
you could go,

14:31.137 --> 14:33.971
Why would you pick
somewhere so cold?

14:35.175 --> 14:37.442
- I heard about the amazing
one-man pride parade.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.877
(strained groan)

14:40.012 --> 14:41.813
(alarm beeping)
matthew? Whoa.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.180
- Oh...

14:43.216 --> 14:47.117
It felt like someone
just walked on my grave.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.653
- Yeah, your rhythm spiked.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.788
I think your aicd misfired
again.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.724
It's a good thing
we're going to winnipeg.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.125
You're going to need
a cardiologist

14:54.194 --> 14:56.794
To reset it or replace it.
- Uh, stef...

14:56.830 --> 14:58.595
Dispatch just heard
back from winnipeg.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.064
Memorial's not accepting
any patients.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.598
They're at capacity.
- What?

15:01.635 --> 15:05.336
- Guess this is pretty common
for up north, huh?

15:05.338 --> 15:07.338
- Not usually twice
in one night

15:07.473 --> 15:08.873
And not while we're already
in the air.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.608
What about kenora?

15:10.743 --> 15:12.877
- Uh, we'll need to fuel up
when we get there.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.245
Dispatch, this is 911.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.014
Patient needs a cardiology team.
Requesting kenora.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.218
-<i> 911, you're good</i>
<i> to proceed to kenora.</i>

15:20.220 --> 15:22.286
<i> We'll alert the local</i>
<i> ambulance to meet you.</i>

15:22.289 --> 15:23.621
(strained groan)

15:23.690 --> 15:25.289
- The misfires
are getting closer.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.824
- My life...

15:26.960 --> 15:28.826
Flashed before my eyes.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.362
Having a high school sweetheart

15:31.398 --> 15:33.297
Must sound old-fashioned to you.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.967
- No, I had one.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.168
Even took her to prom.

15:38.204 --> 15:40.037
(strained groan)

15:40.173 --> 15:42.440
Okay, alright.
How much longer to kenora?

15:42.575 --> 15:43.907
- Ten minutes.

15:44.978 --> 15:49.847
- Just when I was getting
to the good stuff.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.315
Can't leave me hanging.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.583
Prom?

15:52.652 --> 15:54.852
- Um, yeah.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.720
It was my girlfriend mel's idea.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.322
She was like that.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.791
She got excited
about everything.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.927
She made everything exciting.
(chuckles nervously)

16:02.929 --> 16:04.662
Yeah.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.264
She wanted to do it all up,
you know?

16:06.266 --> 16:07.799
Limo, corsage, the works.

16:07.934 --> 16:11.435
- You wore a corsage?
(chuckles)

16:16.843 --> 16:18.976
- Mel said the flowers
would last longer this way.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.613
- Oh... Oh, that's romantic.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.449
So what happened?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.217
Are you still in touch?

16:27.354 --> 16:29.486
- Uh, no.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.489
But um, I miss her.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.159
(strained groan)
matthew? Matthew!

16:35.228 --> 16:37.495
He needs an er now!
- We have a problem.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.964
It's too foggy to land.
- This wasn't the forecast.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.966
The vis has dropped
a quarter of a mile.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.368
We can't even shoot
the approach.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.736
- We have to.
The ambulance is waiting.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.105
- We can't land in this.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.773
Okay, chops. Find alternates.
- On it.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.875
- There are no alternates.
There are no other hospitals.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.510
He has a runaway aicd, brodie.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.045
If we don't land somewhere
with a hospital now,

16:54.114 --> 16:55.579
The patient will die.
- We have to make

16:55.615 --> 16:56.981
The right choice for everyone
in the aircraft.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.949
Not just the patient.
- Okay, look.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.485
There's the aurora golf course.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.554
It's a fly-in resort
and it has pumps year-round.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.856
- There's no hospitals there.
It's 45 minutes from kenora.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.526
- Or, or, or,
there is a flight school.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.928
It's got a strip big enough
to land a 200.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.264
And it's got pumps.
And it's about

17:13.266 --> 17:14.698
A 30-minute ride
to the hospital.

17:14.768 --> 17:16.534
- 30 minutes for the ambulance
to meet us,

17:16.603 --> 17:18.202
Then another 30
to get him to the hospital.

17:18.337 --> 17:19.603
The patient doesn't
have that long.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.139
(groaning)

17:21.141 --> 17:23.273
(alarm beeping)
I'm coming, matthew.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.276
- We can't let him die, bodes.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.611
Alright, if there is a chance,
any chance,

17:27.647 --> 17:29.814
We'd have to get him
to the hospital,

17:29.949 --> 17:32.116
I think we need to hold,
alright? It's five more minutes.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.717
- If the fog rolls
to the alternates

17:33.787 --> 17:36.687
And the vis drops there,
we can't land at all.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.489
- But what if we leave
and the weather opens up?

17:38.491 --> 17:40.357
- What if it doesn't?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.360
- There needs to be
another option.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.228
- Look, I know you want to find

17:44.230 --> 17:45.630
The right solution
where no one dies

17:45.765 --> 17:47.031
Or gets hurt,
and you can finally solve

17:47.166 --> 17:48.499
The impossible problem.

17:48.634 --> 17:51.435
But this isn't a simulation
at selection camp, chops.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.070
This is real.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.206
(tense music)

17:57.110 --> 17:58.309
I'm the captain.
We're diverting

17:58.311 --> 17:59.477
To the flight school.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.611
- Bodie, you can't.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.180
Bodie, the ambulance
is down there.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.381
It's matthew's only chance.

18:04.383 --> 18:05.650
- I'll call kenora.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.718
Tell the ambulance
to meet us at flight school.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.386
(groaning)
- damn it.

18:11.791 --> 18:12.957
I need help back here.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.158
- I got this.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.327
(alarm beeping)

18:16.329 --> 18:18.429
(panting)

18:18.564 --> 18:20.330
- I'm going to give midazolam.
I need you to lower

18:20.366 --> 18:21.999
The stretcher in case
I have to defibrillate him.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.469
- I thought the heart being
shocked was the problem.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.471
- It is. But if this thing
keeps going,

18:27.540 --> 18:28.940
It's going to put him
into lethal arrhythmia.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.408
He needs a hospital.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.876
- What do you do
at the hospital?

18:31.878 --> 18:33.544
To stop the pacemakers.

18:33.679 --> 18:36.446
- They put a magnet over
the aicd, it flips it off.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.184
- Golf course.
Go to the golf course!

18:40.320 --> 18:42.319
- Chopper, that's an extra
10 minutes for the ambulance.

18:42.388 --> 18:43.754
- Trust me, there's a solution.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.489
But we have to land
at the golf course.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.624
- Cho...

18:46.693 --> 18:48.692
(engine roaring)

18:50.396 --> 18:52.262
(tense music)

18:53.566 --> 18:54.898
(alarm beeping)

18:54.934 --> 18:57.334
(groaning)

18:58.704 --> 19:00.304
- Where the hell is chopper?
- Matthew's not gonna survive

19:00.373 --> 19:01.839
Until the ambulance gets here.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.307
- Found it!

19:03.442 --> 19:05.176
The flywheel in riding
lawnmowers is magnetic.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.311
And golf courses
always have lawnmowers.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.413
- Chopper...
- It will work.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.048
- Okay.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.683
Move to the top of the shirt.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.524
It's off.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.393
V-tach, he's got a pulse.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.094
We need to cardiovert.
Take that.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.529
- Yeah.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.765
(multiple machines beeping)

19:33.740 --> 19:36.607
- Charging 100 joules...
(whirring)

19:37.343 --> 19:39.143
Clear!
(grunts)

19:40.479 --> 19:42.046
Charging 100...

19:42.048 --> 19:43.614
(whirring)

19:44.984 --> 19:46.316
Clear!

19:50.623 --> 19:51.855
Dialing up to 200.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.725
C'mon, matthew, c'mon.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.493
Clear!

20:01.668 --> 20:03.100
(alarm stops)
that's it.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.504
We did it.
Normal rhythm.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.705
He's going to be okay.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.507
(exhales deeply)

20:12.778 --> 20:14.311
- You did it, chops.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.318
- Am I in heaven?
Or hell?

20:21.688 --> 20:23.721
- Even better. You're in kenora.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.523
(chuckles)

20:25.658 --> 20:27.625
(phone dings)

20:30.196 --> 20:31.862
- Thompson community
didn't redirect

20:31.931 --> 20:33.531
Because of staffing issues.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.432
They're on lockdown
for code silver.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.668
- Lexi's there.
- They're all there.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.144
<i> (woman over pa system):</i>
<i> Code silver in emergency...</i>

20:47.146 --> 20:49.013
- Oh, my god, oh, my god,
oh, my god, crystal...

20:50.817 --> 20:53.017
- Kyla, what have you done?

20:53.019 --> 20:55.019
- No one was supposed
to get hurt.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.755
Y-you can't come at a soldier
like that.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.222
- It looks like it
went through clean,

20:59.259 --> 21:00.291
But you're losing
a lot of blood.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.259
(alarm blaring)

21:04.998 --> 21:07.131
The whole hospital will be
locked down and put on redirect.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.333
- I hoped we'd have
a real doctor with us

21:09.369 --> 21:10.701
When we got locked down.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.571
I need you to patch her up
so that she can do the surgery.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.508
- I can't do a transplant.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.643
I'm not a doctor or surgeon.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.445
And even if I was,

21:21.447 --> 21:24.248
We don't keep organs
at the hospital.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.250
We don't have
a liver for her.

21:26.385 --> 21:27.918
- Yeah, you do.

21:30.223 --> 21:31.855
You're going to use my liver.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.591
- Kyla, no!

21:34.627 --> 21:36.460
- I did all the research, mom.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.662
You only need part of my liver.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.931
It can grow back. Mom!

21:41.768 --> 21:44.669
- It... It is possible

21:44.804 --> 21:47.304
To do a partial
liver transplant.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.340
Is that what you want?

21:50.376 --> 21:52.142
- Crystal...

21:54.113 --> 21:56.814
Crystal can't do that
injured like this.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.617
I need to clean her wound,
pack it with hemostatic gauze.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.785
None of that I have here.
I have to get it.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.455
- Take off her shoelaces,
use them to tie her hands.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.695
We'll be right back, okay, mom?

22:16.169 --> 22:17.501
- Mia?

22:17.503 --> 22:18.769
Mia!

22:19.906 --> 22:21.105
Hey.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.240
What's going on?
Why is it so dark?

22:23.242 --> 22:25.109
- There's a security issue.
Everyone's supposed to stay

22:25.111 --> 22:28.179
In their rooms. Did you see
a little girl, cute cape?

22:28.314 --> 22:29.714
Okay, lock the door.
Don't come out

22:29.849 --> 22:31.182
Until you hear a page
saying it's safe.

22:31.317 --> 22:32.650
Lock it.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.785
(soft suspenseful music)

22:40.126 --> 22:42.726
-<i> Code silver</i>
<i> in the emergency room.</i>

22:42.729 --> 22:45.229
<i> All patients and staff</i>
<i> shelter in place.</i>

22:46.432 --> 22:47.831
- This way.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.168
C'mon, this way.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.537
- Mia?

22:54.540 --> 22:55.606
Mia?

22:55.675 --> 22:57.975
(sobbing softly)

22:58.945 --> 23:00.144
Mia?

23:00.813 --> 23:02.146
She's here.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.216
- I wanted to find
the bad guys

23:05.351 --> 23:07.284
But it's really dark out there.

23:07.353 --> 23:08.786
- You alright, bud?

23:08.921 --> 23:12.189
- I was thirsty.
I saw the machines.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.690
- I think the vending machine
might be

23:13.726 --> 23:15.793
A little loud right now.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.360
I'll get you some water.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.530
- I wasn't brave like super sam.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.732
I could drink all
the super juice in the world,

23:21.801 --> 23:23.567
But...

23:23.636 --> 23:25.169
I'll still be scared.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.106
- I get scared sometimes, too.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.509
- I get scared a lot
since mom left.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.311
Dad says he isn't, but...

23:34.380 --> 23:37.681
Sometimes I feel like he is,
because it's just us now.

23:37.683 --> 23:40.050
- It's harder to be brave
when you're alone.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.719
Last time something
scary happened to me,

23:42.789 --> 23:44.488
I was alone, too.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.725
Sometimes it's hard
to explain to people

23:47.727 --> 23:50.527
Why you're scared
and that can make

23:50.563 --> 23:52.996
You feel even more alone.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.732
But you know what helped
me feel safe again?

23:56.035 --> 23:57.768
Being back with my friends.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.303
Let's get you back
to your dad.

24:00.339 --> 24:01.805
- Lexi!

24:03.843 --> 24:05.309
It's hayley.

24:05.311 --> 24:07.244
I think she's hurt,
we have to help her.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.446
- Oh, get down!

24:10.716 --> 24:13.083
Shit, what do we do?

24:13.219 --> 24:14.285
- We have to help hayley.

24:14.420 --> 24:17.754
- What about mia?
We can't leave her here alone.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.892
- We'll make sure it's clear,
we'll take mia back to her dad.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.293
Then, we go find hayley.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.442
You know, lex,
I know what it's like

24:38.577 --> 24:40.044
To feel scared and alone.

24:42.448 --> 24:44.915
When I was in nursing school,

24:44.984 --> 24:47.318
I used to take the bus home
late at night.

24:47.453 --> 24:50.186
This one night,
there was these guys on the bus.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.124
I didn't notice
them at first, but...

24:54.260 --> 24:55.459
They kept eyeing me.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.229
When I got off at my stop,

24:58.364 --> 25:00.264
They got off, too.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.266
You know, I thought
maybe it would have been

25:02.268 --> 25:04.401
A coincidence
or something, but...

25:06.539 --> 25:08.338
They followed me
for five blocks.

25:09.442 --> 25:13.110
When I got to my house,
I just kept walking.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.480
I didn't want them
to know where I lived.

25:18.284 --> 25:21.018
My neighbour was outside
walking his dog.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.988
I started talking to him
so I wouldn't be alone.

25:27.159 --> 25:30.828
Eventually, they got tired
of waiting and left.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.264
- I'm sorry, tris.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.435
- I just want you to know

25:38.437 --> 25:40.304
Whatever it is, lex,

25:40.306 --> 25:41.838
You're not alone.

25:44.443 --> 25:45.976
- Thanks, t, but...

25:46.012 --> 25:48.545
- Look, you don't have
to tell me or even nowak.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.049
But when you're ready,

25:52.118 --> 25:53.517
You should talk to someone.

25:58.858 --> 26:02.859
- Okay, I need antibiotics,
pain meds...

26:07.533 --> 26:08.866
- What's taking so long?

26:08.868 --> 26:11.402
- Uh, I just need
a few more things.

26:15.408 --> 26:20.276
You know, my mom died of cancer.

26:23.316 --> 26:25.148
When I was 13.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.819
Grief can make us do
a lot of things

26:28.888 --> 26:30.554
We wouldn't normally do.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.424
- Were you close?

26:35.294 --> 26:37.060
- Yeah, she was my hero.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.297
She's why I became a nurse.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.166
Labour and delivery.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.800
Just like her.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.470
She was my best friend.

26:50.343 --> 26:55.245
The surgery, the chemo,
it's all very intense, and...

26:55.247 --> 26:58.715
I was a kid so she didn't
want me to see her like that.

26:58.851 --> 27:02.052
So they decided
to send me to b.C.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.954
To be with my aunt
for the summer.

27:09.195 --> 27:12.196
I don't think I fully...

27:12.198 --> 27:15.666
Realized what
my mom went through

27:15.801 --> 27:17.668
Before I had my mastectomy.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.471
It made me realize how...

27:20.606 --> 27:22.172
(sighs)

27:22.241 --> 27:24.875
...Scared she must have been.

27:24.877 --> 27:27.077
How alone she must have felt.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.548
And in the end,

27:31.617 --> 27:35.486
My dad wanted me to come home
to be with her.

27:35.621 --> 27:36.986
And...

27:39.958 --> 27:42.559
I didn't make it. So...

27:44.897 --> 27:46.796
I never got to say goodbye.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.999
(breathing deeply)

27:52.605 --> 27:56.539
Kyla, you are so lucky
that you have that chance.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.242
That's what matters
to your mom.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.378
Not any of this, not you
trying to get her surgery.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.814
- My mom and I weren't close.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.251
- But earlier tonight...
- Yeah, that's new.

28:08.421 --> 28:09.853
About five months new.

28:09.988 --> 28:12.789
- Since she got sober.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.458
- When I was a kid,
we lived in a rundown farmhouse

28:15.494 --> 28:17.260
In the middle of nowhere.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.196
No neighbours for miles.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.665
One day,

28:22.702 --> 28:26.069
Must have been January
because it was freezing, I...

28:27.339 --> 28:30.607
Got off the bus from school
and... Door was locked.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.011
Angie was out drinking again.

28:35.548 --> 28:39.816
So I sat on the porch
and waited for her to come back.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.621
I was still waiting out there
the next day

28:44.690 --> 28:46.557
When the bus came back
to pick me up.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.559
- I'm sorry.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.928
- Yeah, I could have used a mom.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.230
Who put her kid first.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.099
But angie was always busy
getting drunk.

29:00.039 --> 29:03.173
- She didn't get sober
until the cancer.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.574
- No.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.444
They don't give livers
to alcoholics.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.950
Suddenly, she's this
whole new person.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.521
The mom I always wanted.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.259
But you can't make up
for 20 years

29:22.261 --> 29:24.561
In two weeks of leave time.
(sniffles)

29:25.698 --> 29:27.731
So let's go.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.734
(tense music)

29:34.507 --> 29:36.940
- Alright, clear.
Now's our chance.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.411
- Okay, c'mon, mia,
it's time to go.

29:41.413 --> 29:44.347
- I was just having
some super juice to be brave.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.886
- Oh!
I was so worried.

29:48.888 --> 29:51.255
You must have been so scared.
- She did great.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.557
- I gotta go look for hayley
and find out where crystal is.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.292
- Yeah, I'll try calling
the police again.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.427
- Mia? Mia!
(lexi): Tristan!

29:57.429 --> 29:58.562
- Mia!
- Tristan!

29:58.697 --> 30:00.163
- She's seizing.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.833
Watch her head.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.634
Hang on, mia.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.570
- I thought you said
she was doing better.

30:06.572 --> 30:07.971
- She was.
She was really thirsty,

30:08.007 --> 30:09.839
But she felt better
after drinking all that water.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.442
What's in a super juice?
- What super juice?

30:16.915 --> 30:19.283
- That's my antihistamine,
I have allergies.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.118
- She's got diphenhydramine
toxicity.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.120
- Oh, no. I thought
it was just juice or something.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.122
- I keep it
in the medicine cabinet,

30:25.257 --> 30:27.124
I didn't think she could reach.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.492
- I'm giving fluids
and physostigmine.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.060
- Super sam's juice
is in a red bottle.

30:30.195 --> 30:31.595
She must have seen it
and thought

30:31.664 --> 30:33.897
It was the same thing.
- She going to be okay, tris?

30:34.032 --> 30:36.466
- C'mon, sweetie. C'mon.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.301
Please, please, please.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.875
- The pain med should help soon.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.943
She's grieving.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.978
She just wants more time
with her mom.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.348
- I mean, I get it, but...

30:52.384 --> 30:53.816
(sighs)

30:58.457 --> 31:00.690
I can't remove
part of kyla's liver

31:00.759 --> 31:02.993
Without putting them both under.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.728
- She'll have to give up
the gun.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.766
- I can't believe failing
my endocrinology exam

31:09.902 --> 31:12.235
Would be the worst thing
to happen to me tonight.

31:12.271 --> 31:15.538
- I cannot believe
you failed anything.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.374
- I mean, I didn't. I passed.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.644
But barely, and I'm not
used to barely passing.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.314
- You're used to what?

31:24.316 --> 31:26.116
Making the rest of us
look bad?

31:26.185 --> 31:27.284
(scoffs)

31:27.353 --> 31:30.387
Do you know what they call

31:30.522 --> 31:31.922
The person that graduates
med school

31:31.924 --> 31:33.723
At the bottom
of their class, crys?

31:33.792 --> 31:35.725
Doctor.

31:35.761 --> 31:38.594
Maybe take it a little bit
easier on yourself.

31:38.631 --> 31:40.063
You're good at medicine.

31:40.198 --> 31:41.798
- Yeah, but being good
at medicine

31:41.867 --> 31:43.934
And being good at medical school

31:44.069 --> 31:46.369
Are two completely
different things.

31:47.873 --> 31:49.239
- She ready?

31:50.276 --> 31:52.142
- We just have
to prep you for surgery

31:52.144 --> 31:53.677
And the anaesthesia will--

31:53.746 --> 31:55.211
- It'll be a little hard
to hold this

31:55.281 --> 31:57.180
If I'm knocked out, huh?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.215
You were an l and d nurse,
right?

32:00.152 --> 32:01.952
You can give me an epidural.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.121
Just freezing from
the waist down, right?

32:04.256 --> 32:05.689
If it's good enough
for a c-section,

32:05.691 --> 32:07.256
It's good enough for this.

32:10.195 --> 32:12.896
- You want to go here,
between l4 and l5.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.498
- Hayley, if we screw this up...

32:16.268 --> 32:18.035
- Just hang on, okay, mom?

32:20.639 --> 32:22.773
Let's go, I'm watching.

32:22.908 --> 32:25.142
- Okay, kyla.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.712
You may feel a sting.
It's just the local.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.082
- Been through worse.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.886
- Here we go.

32:39.358 --> 32:42.492
(breathing deeply)

32:44.596 --> 32:47.096
I'm in.
- Kyla...

32:48.767 --> 32:51.801
Once we administer
this anaesthesia,

32:51.870 --> 32:55.004
There's no going back,
that's it.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.409
- I'm not changing my mind.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.478
- Maybe not right now, but...

33:02.481 --> 33:04.580
You might think
differently after.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.617
You might have regrets.

33:11.724 --> 33:13.089
- It's different.

33:14.292 --> 33:16.426
You didn't have a choice.

33:16.561 --> 33:19.028
You were too late
to be there for your mom.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.866
- Kyla, I lied to you.

33:28.974 --> 33:31.374
When my...

33:31.443 --> 33:32.776
Dad called,

33:32.778 --> 33:34.978
There was still time
for me to get home.

33:37.483 --> 33:39.148
But I said no.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.985
I told him I didn't
want to be there.

33:42.987 --> 33:48.458
My mom wanted me when
she was dying and I didn't go.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.461
Because I couldn't handle it.

33:52.331 --> 33:55.198
I was thinking of myself and...

33:55.234 --> 33:56.733
What I wanted.

33:59.604 --> 34:02.205
Your mom doesn't want
this, kyla.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.475
Please.

34:08.047 --> 34:10.346
- Why do my arms feel heavy?

34:10.382 --> 34:12.082
(kyla panting)
what's happening?

34:12.217 --> 34:14.484
(breathing rapidly)

34:14.520 --> 34:15.885
What did you do?

34:15.954 --> 34:17.821
- We gave you an epidural.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.489
We just went high.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.491
- I'll get the oxygen.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.360
- Kyla,

34:23.495 --> 34:24.561
You there?

34:24.696 --> 34:26.896
- It's okay, angie.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.097
It's over now.

34:28.133 --> 34:31.000
(soft music)

34:37.643 --> 34:39.309
(angie crying)

34:39.378 --> 34:42.846
- This isn't the way
I wanted it.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.717
But I'm glad we're together.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.923
Addiction's an awful thing.

34:53.058 --> 34:54.991
(crying)

34:57.830 --> 35:00.763
And you're the one
who paid for it.

35:04.036 --> 35:07.003
(gasping breaths)

35:07.039 --> 35:09.372
I'm sorry.

35:13.846 --> 35:16.712
I didn't get sober...

35:18.817 --> 35:21.784
For a transplant, kyla.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.825
I got sober...

35:29.995 --> 35:31.628
To be with you.

35:33.565 --> 35:36.098
(soft music)

35:44.776 --> 35:47.210
(continuous beep)

35:47.212 --> 35:49.746
(sobbing)

36:05.898 --> 36:07.397
- You okay?

36:07.399 --> 36:09.732
- You're the one who got shot.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.936
- Yeah, but with a little
rest, antibiotics.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.438
I won't even miss
that much school.

36:18.577 --> 36:21.677
That was some heavy stuff.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.346
- Yeah.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.216
I've been thinking
a lot about my mom

36:26.351 --> 36:27.817
Since my surgery.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.287
I've been having a lot of pain.

36:33.225 --> 36:35.491
- Well, if it's anything
like this, I get it.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.698
- And I forgot to refill
my prescription.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.836
Do you think
you could write me a new one?

36:46.838 --> 36:48.571
- Yeah.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.506
I can give you a few
to get through.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.376
You'll follow up
with your surgeon?

36:53.378 --> 36:54.678
- Yeah.
- Okay.

36:55.781 --> 36:59.181
- Well, I don't have
my clinical tonight.

36:59.218 --> 37:02.185
What do you say we go home,

37:02.320 --> 37:05.554
Get some sleep, and meet up
at the whiskey hatch?

37:06.758 --> 37:08.257
- I'd like that.

37:11.496 --> 37:12.995
- Guess it's my turn.

37:16.401 --> 37:19.001
(emotional music)

37:21.907 --> 37:23.406
- I really can't thank
you enough.

37:23.541 --> 37:26.676
I feel so stupid for not
realizing sooner. Thank you.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.277
- Marvellous mia
is gonna be okay,

37:28.313 --> 37:30.213
But no more eating
and drinking stuff

37:30.348 --> 37:32.482
Without asking a grown-up first.
Got it?

37:32.551 --> 37:34.283
- Yeah, you're super enough.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.287
- There she is.
(chuckling)

37:37.422 --> 37:40.490
- Yeah. I don't need to be
super anymore anyway.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.826
We're okay just being
the two of us, right, dad?

37:42.828 --> 37:44.027
- Yeah.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.799
(birds chirping)

37:51.937 --> 37:54.304
- Hey! Are you okay?
We heard about the shooter.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.905
What the hell--

38:03.048 --> 38:04.381
You're not okay.

38:14.092 --> 38:17.193
There was this man
at rocky narrows.

38:17.195 --> 38:18.995
He forced his way on the plane.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.466
I was too afraid to say no.

38:23.601 --> 38:27.070
Or what might happen
if I tried to say no.

38:27.139 --> 38:28.771
- Did he hurt you?

38:30.542 --> 38:35.411
- But the whole flight
I could feel him sitting there.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.816
Like, at any time
he could just grab me.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.152
I...
(sighs)

38:44.923 --> 38:47.157
I was alone.

38:47.292 --> 38:49.158
And if he'd...

38:49.227 --> 38:50.760
I wouldn't be able to...

38:50.796 --> 38:52.629
You know?
- Okay.

38:54.232 --> 38:55.965
It's okay.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.401
(exhales deeply)

38:59.104 --> 39:00.437
It's okay.

39:01.306 --> 39:03.106
(sobbing)

39:03.108 --> 39:05.074
It's okay, it's okay.

39:08.180 --> 39:10.279
- Flying is my safe place.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.748
And he took that.

39:13.752 --> 39:18.621
He robbed me,
and I'm just so...

39:21.660 --> 39:23.660
- Does wheezer
know about this?

39:23.795 --> 39:27.063
- I tried to tell him,
but it didn't come out right.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.599
It's like I couldn't
explain it in a way

39:30.635 --> 39:33.869
That made sense to him.
And then I started to think...

39:34.973 --> 39:36.205
Maybe he was right.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.074
Maybe I messed up.

39:39.111 --> 39:41.144
(sighs)
I felt so stupid.

39:41.213 --> 39:45.415
- Hey, you're not stupid. Okay?

39:45.484 --> 39:48.884
You knew what could happen,
what does happen all the time.

39:49.954 --> 39:52.288
I hate that you went
through this alone.

39:52.424 --> 39:53.556
But listen to me,

39:53.558 --> 39:57.093
You are not alone anymore,
okay?

39:57.228 --> 40:01.131
If you need me to listen

40:01.266 --> 40:05.334
So you can just vent
about how unfair this is

40:05.370 --> 40:07.570
And how angry you are, I'm here.

40:07.705 --> 40:09.505
If you need a shoulder
to cry on,

40:09.541 --> 40:11.374
Mine are pretty strong.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.377
If you want me to tell you
that you were right

40:14.446 --> 40:16.178
And that your actions
were valid,

40:16.214 --> 40:18.381
I will because they were.

40:18.516 --> 40:20.617
And hey, if you want me
to scream at wheezer,

40:20.619 --> 40:22.251
Put me in, coach.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.720
I can go down now.
I can go right now.

40:28.059 --> 40:31.527
- Mostly, I just want you.

40:32.164 --> 40:33.530
- You got me, lex.

40:34.533 --> 40:37.666
I'm on your team, always.

40:37.702 --> 40:39.001
Okay?

40:40.005 --> 40:41.303
Come here.

40:41.339 --> 40:42.805
You got me.

40:42.841 --> 40:46.075
(emotional music)

40:49.781 --> 40:51.948
(breathing deeply)

41:09.234 --> 41:11.434
<i> (dr. Yana): Crystal,</i>
<i> you got shot.</i>

41:11.569 --> 41:15.704
<i> It is actually okay</i>
<i> to take some time to heal.</i>

41:15.740 --> 41:17.774
- I can heal at work.
I won't lift anything

41:17.909 --> 41:19.576
Heavier than a chart.

41:19.578 --> 41:20.977
Or a textbook.

41:21.046 --> 41:24.446
<i> - Ugh, if you're really</i>
<i> determined not to rest.</i>

41:25.650 --> 41:27.851
<i> I read your paper</i>
<i> on photorhabdus luminscens.</i>

41:28.786 --> 41:30.386
<i> It's excellent work, crystal.</i>

41:30.455 --> 41:32.855
<i> Maybe even good enough</i>
<i> to get published.</i>

41:32.924 --> 41:36.792
- Oh, wow.
Um... Thank you, dr. Noah.

41:36.862 --> 41:39.529
<i> - Yeah, don't thank me yet.</i>
<i> I do have notes.</i>

41:39.531 --> 41:41.731
<i> But if you come to my office</i>
<i> hours this evening,</i>

41:41.800 --> 41:43.066
<i> We can go through it.</i>

41:43.068 --> 41:45.067
- Of course, I'll head over now!

41:45.103 --> 41:46.569
(phone beeps)

41:50.342 --> 41:52.841
(rock music)

42:05.823 --> 42:07.556
(phone chimes)

42:29.981 --> 42:33.549
(emotional music)

43:04.149 --> 43:07.650
(breathing deeply)

43:12.557 --> 43:15.024
(gasping breaths)

43:15.894 --> 43:17.893
(tense music)

43:43.054 --> 43:45.254
Subtitling: Difuze
