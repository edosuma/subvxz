♪ ♪

00:07.708 --> 00:09.791
How do I look?

00:09.791 --> 00:12.750
- (Exhales) Hot.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.250
- You need to get ready.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.583
The maid of honor
and the best man

00:15.583 --> 00:17.041
can not be late for this dinner.

00:17.041 --> 00:22.583
Can you help?
- Ooh, I can do that.

00:22.583 --> 00:24.166
(Zipper zips)

00:24.166 --> 00:27.416
- Zip up, zip up.
No, no, no. (laughs)

00:27.416 --> 00:30.833
You need to get ready.

00:30.833 --> 00:33.125
- Oh.

00:33.125 --> 00:36.041
Look who thinks...
she can boss me around?

00:36.041 --> 00:37.750
It's been three weeks,

00:37.750 --> 00:40.708
suddenly she's acting
like she's my...

00:40.708 --> 00:42.666
- What?
- Girlfriend.

00:42.666 --> 00:45.666
- (Laughs) I am not.
- Yeah, you are.

00:45.666 --> 00:47.583
And I like it.

00:47.583 --> 00:49.916
(Passionate kissing)

00:49.916 --> 00:51.500
- Oh, we're gonna be late.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.000
- (sarcastic tone)
Oh, we're gonna be late.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.416
Erica: The night before
a wedding,

00:55.416 --> 00:58.916
is like the calm
before the storm.

00:58.916 --> 01:03.000
Everyone knows what's coming,
and the part they will play.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.625
Sam: Erica, the alcohol
is arriving at 11:30
tomorrow morning.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.833
So, if you could clear
a space in the fridge
for the white wine.

01:06.833 --> 01:09.000
- Hey, Sam, you need to be
relaxing right now.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.041
- There comes a time
to relinquish control.

01:11.041 --> 01:13.875
Whatever will be, will be.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.541
- And I will take care of it.

01:15.541 --> 01:17.958
- Barb, the brisket
it's delicious.

01:17.958 --> 01:20.333
- Thank you, Tania.
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

01:20.333 --> 01:22.458
- And your two daughters,
they both look so beautiful.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.958
- (Mumbles of approval)

01:23.958 --> 01:25.416
- Hey, mom, can you pass
the kugel, please?

01:25.416 --> 01:27.041
Josh's dad: Josh, you sure
lucked out with this one.

01:27.041 --> 01:28.708
Josh: Yeah.
Josh's dad: And Erica...

01:28.708 --> 01:32.333
from everything Sam tells us,
you'd be a hell of a catch.

01:32.333 --> 01:33.791
I bet someone will snap you
up quick.

01:33.791 --> 01:36.166
- Oh, someone already has,
didn't you notice?

01:36.166 --> 01:38.625
She and Ry-Ry arrived looking
a little disheveled.

01:38.625 --> 01:41.083
- Really?
- No.

01:41.083 --> 01:42.791
Family: (Chuckles)

01:42.791 --> 01:44.791
Henry: (laughs) the best man
and the maid of honor.

01:44.791 --> 01:47.208
- Well, I'm only the mother,
and the last one to know.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.083
- Mom, There's nothing to know.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.583
- Don't guilt her out, Barb.

01:50.583 --> 01:52.833
She is entitled
to a private life.

01:52.833 --> 01:54.708
- I wasn't guilting her out,
Gary.

01:54.708 --> 01:57.708
- Oh, I'm just giving you
the heads up, Barb and Gary.

01:57.708 --> 01:59.916
The first set of grandkids
might be coming from these two.

01:59.916 --> 02:01.541
- Josh. (Scattered laughter)

02:01.541 --> 02:03.083
- Stop.

02:03.083 --> 02:04.916
Family: (Chuckles)

02:04.916 --> 02:07.666
- Shouldn't we be talking about
the bride and groom?

02:07.666 --> 02:11.041
- I'd like to make a toast.
- Great.

02:11.041 --> 02:13.250
- I used to wonder how on earth
my scrawny best friend here

02:13.250 --> 02:15.000
could ever score a girl
like Sam.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
- (Laughter)

02:18.000 --> 02:21.208
Sam you are gracious,
intelligent and beautiful.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.125
- Here, here.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.875
- I've met lot of women
in my life

02:24.875 --> 02:29.333
and I can honestly say
you are one in a million.

02:29.333 --> 02:30.791
I don't know how you got
so lucky, bro,

02:30.791 --> 02:33.208
but I'm glad you did.
All the best!

02:33.208 --> 02:39.041
(Cheers, glasses clink)
To Sam! Cheers!
Very nicely said!

02:39.041 --> 02:40.791
- Wouldn't you like
to say something?

02:40.791 --> 02:45.333
- Oh, no.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.208
I don't really do improv.
(Laughs)

02:47.208 --> 02:48.500
- Oh, come on, sweetheart,
say something

02:48.500 --> 02:50.041
about your brother-in-law.

02:50.041 --> 02:52.333
Gary: Don't pressure her, Barb.
If she doesn't want to...

02:52.333 --> 02:54.208
- I just thought it would be
nice, Gary.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.625
- Okay, no, it's fine.
It's fine.

02:57.625 --> 03:00.791
Um, (clears throat) Okay.

03:00.791 --> 03:05.958
Josh... is a real...

03:05.958 --> 03:07.625
character.
(Family chuckles)

03:07.625 --> 03:09.791
And he always has been. Um...

03:09.791 --> 03:12.125
He has a really unique
sense of humor,

03:12.125 --> 03:14.208
and he's always trying
to entertain us

03:14.208 --> 03:17.500
with comments that are
supposed to be funny.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.875
Sometimes they even are.

03:18.875 --> 03:21.458
(Family chuckles)

03:21.458 --> 03:23.583
Um... and he is known for
just telling it like it is,

03:23.583 --> 03:24.958
whether you like it or not.
(knocks table)

03:24.958 --> 03:28.833
So... here's to the bride
and groom!

03:28.833 --> 03:31.916
- Cheers! To the bride and
groom!

03:31.916 --> 03:38.791
(Applauding)

03:38.791 --> 03:40.416
- Sam, I am so sorry.

03:40.416 --> 03:42.375
I was just, I was really
nervous, and I wasn't ready.

03:42.375 --> 03:44.125
- I know you were nervous,

03:44.125 --> 03:45.416
but I want tomorrow to go well

03:45.416 --> 03:47.166
and if you don't feel like
you can make a speech--

03:47.166 --> 03:49.750
No, I will have a beautiful
speech ready for tomorrow.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.791
And I will manage the cake,
and the dj, and the seating,

03:51.791 --> 03:53.416
and you do not have
to worry about a thing.

03:53.416 --> 03:54.875
- Come on, Sam, let's go.

03:54.875 --> 03:56.208
You can yak with your sister
tomorrow.

03:56.208 --> 03:57.625
- Okay, just give me a second.

03:57.625 --> 03:59.125
- No, I'm tired. I wanna leave.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.875
Just grab your purse,
so we can get home,

04:00.875 --> 04:05.125
Get to bed, get up
and get married.

04:05.125 --> 04:08.333
Get this whole thing over with.

04:08.333 --> 04:12.000
I'm just kidding.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Erica: It's an unspoken rule,
that on the day of the wedding,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.208
we must put away any worry,
any secret, lingering doubts.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.458
But what do you do if you
can't shake the feeling

04:19.458 --> 04:23.583
that someone you love is about
to make a terrible mistake?

Ryan: What?

05:13.791 --> 05:15.291
- This speech is killing me.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.375
- Wrote mine two weeks ago,
took me an hour.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.750
- Oh, that's great,
good for you. Super-duper.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.250
- Don't over-think it.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.666
Say some nice things
about the happy couple,

05:22.666 --> 05:24.916
wish them well... and...

05:26.500 --> 05:28.000
What, do you hate Josh
or something?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.333
- No. Why would you even say
that?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.916
- Well, your toast last night
was a little...

05:33.916 --> 05:35.791
- Oh, it, well, I was,
I was trying to be funny.

05:35.791 --> 05:37.541
- No, you weren't.

05:37.541 --> 05:40.291
You don't think Josh is good
enough for your sister, right?

05:40.291 --> 05:42.125
- No, that's not it.
It's just...

05:43.708 --> 05:45.958
Their relationship,
it makes no sense to me.

05:45.958 --> 05:47.750
- They've been together
for years.

05:47.750 --> 05:49.250
- So? They fight all the time.

05:49.250 --> 05:50.625
And when they're not fighting,
they just, they're...

05:50.625 --> 05:53.333
They're uncomfortable
just being together.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.750
I mean, haven't you
ever noticed that?

05:54.750 --> 05:57.250
- No. But I'm not around
a whole lot.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.291
Have you told Sam?
- No. God, no.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.125
That's not something
you just say to someone.

06:04.125 --> 06:07.083
- I'm not an expert on this,
but watching two people

06:07.083 --> 06:09.250
tells you nothing about what
goes on behind closed doors.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.541
So, just because it doesn't
make sense to you

06:11.541 --> 06:14.041
doesn't mean it doesn't work.

06:19.500 --> 06:25.875
(Towel flaps onto table)

06:25.875 --> 06:29.166
- Mm, coconut.
- I moisturized.

06:29.166 --> 06:30.666
(Laughs) Stop it!

06:30.666 --> 06:32.041
(Gasps) okay, you need
to control yourself.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.375
- But you taste like
a pina colada.

06:33.375 --> 06:35.375
Claire: Well, there she is.

06:36.416 --> 06:40.125
Surprise! I came in
for the wedding.

06:40.125 --> 06:44.458
- Uh, oh. Oh, I mean, oh, wow.
That's... great!

06:44.458 --> 06:46.583
(Kiss)

06:46.583 --> 06:49.166
- Ah, how are you?
- Good. Really wonderful.

06:49.166 --> 06:52.541
- Great!
- Ryan, right?

06:52.541 --> 06:54.041
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

06:54.041 --> 06:56.958
Ryan, this is, uh,
this is Claire.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.375
- Hi.
- Ethan's wife.

07:00.375 --> 07:03.333
- Is that your Harley outside?
- Yeah, she's mine.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.875
- I almost bought one,

07:04.875 --> 07:06.458
but, uh, this one here
talked me out of it.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.083
- Is that right?

07:08.083 --> 07:09.583
- Yeah, she hates them.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.791
Says they are noisy
and dangerous.

07:11.791 --> 07:13.916
- (Half laughs)

07:13.916 --> 07:16.125
- Well, they are,
but sometimes you gotta...

07:16.125 --> 07:18.500
throw caution to the wind,
and live your life, right?

07:18.500 --> 07:19.916
- Exactly.
- Mm-hmm.

07:19.916 --> 07:21.291
- We drove downtown yesterday,

07:21.291 --> 07:22.833
She handled herself like a pro.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.041
- Really? Erica, on a bike?

07:25.041 --> 07:27.250
- I hate to interrupt, but we
should probably get going,

07:27.250 --> 07:28.625
we're gonna be late.

07:28.625 --> 07:30.208
- Oh... ah, sorry.

07:30.208 --> 07:31.583
- No, don't be sorry,
it's just we have,

07:31.583 --> 07:33.708
you know, maid of honor
and best man duties, so.

07:33.708 --> 07:36.583
Uh, but I'll, I'll, uh...
I'll see you at the wedding.

07:36.583 --> 07:37.958
- Yeah.
- All right.

07:37.958 --> 07:43.541
- Yeah.

07:43.541 --> 07:47.041
(Ethan's keys jingle)

07:47.041 --> 07:54.541
- Bye.
- See you.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.083
- Great. Woops.

07:56.083 --> 07:57.500
- Here we go, this way.
- 'Kay, thanks.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.041
- Hi, there. Oh, perfect.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.666
Chairs, they go out in the back
underneath the tent.

08:00.666 --> 08:02.333
Judith can show you.
Judith: Oh, yeah.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.041
- Hi, little baby.

08:04.041 --> 08:06.500
Um, perfect. Booze goes right
in there.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.291
Um, aunt Roberta,
wine is incoming.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.166
Josh: Did I hear someone say
wine?

08:10.166 --> 08:12.125
Barb: Josh, outside! If you see
her in her dress--

08:12.125 --> 08:14.500
- I'm gonna see her every day
for the rest of my life.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.166
Where's my buxom bride, anyway?

08:16.166 --> 08:17.583
- She's upstairs getting
her hair done. Excuse me!

08:17.583 --> 08:19.541
- By my stylist,
who's very good.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.000
Erica: Okay, the frites,
they go on the counter,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.041
and aioli goes in the fridge.

08:23.041 --> 08:24.500
Mom, can you please help?
Josh: You look good.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.000
I saw you and Ryan on the bike
this morning; all cozy.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
- You, outta here.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.166
- You know, as the best man,
you're supposed to be nice
to me.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.916
- I'm your wingman.
I say it's time to go.

08:32.916 --> 08:34.375
- Oh, hi there. Perfect.

08:34.375 --> 08:36.000
Flowers? Um, right this way.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.500
Judith, can you-- oh, perfect.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.416
And all the vases are stacked
up in the garage.

08:39.416 --> 08:41.625
Okay, just call me
if you need anything.

08:41.625 --> 08:44.625
Great. Thanks, Lynn.
You guys good?

08:44.625 --> 08:47.250
Man: Everything's great, Erica.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.291
- (Exhausted sigh)
Judith: You run a tight ship,
Erica Strange.

08:49.291 --> 08:50.666
You know, if publishing job
doesn't work out,

08:50.666 --> 08:52.541
you could totally
be a party planner.

08:52.541 --> 08:55.041
- Oh, yeah, with the last party
I held, I bailed on.

08:55.041 --> 08:57.666
- Stop it. You know this
is gonna be great.

08:57.666 --> 08:59.708
- It is right?
- Yeah.

08:59.708 --> 09:01.583
- I just, I really want it
to be perfect.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.750
Judith: It will.
Erica: For Sam.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.166
Uh, excuse me. Didn't you guys
get the seating plan?

09:06.166 --> 09:08.375
It's three, then four,
then four.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.041
- Oh, you know what?

09:10.041 --> 09:11.291
Take five, I'm gonna handle
this.

09:11.291 --> 09:12.625
- Thanks, Jude.

09:12.625 --> 09:14.166
- (Laughing) Give it back
you're gonna break it!

09:14.166 --> 09:15.750
Give it back!
(Camera clicks)

09:15.750 --> 09:17.666
- What are you doing?
- (Patronizing laugh)

09:17.666 --> 09:21.708
- Hey, you're in big trouble,
mister. What are you doing?

09:21.708 --> 09:24.375
Josh: Little Flash. (laughs)
Photographer: Hey! Give it back.

09:24.375 --> 09:26.166
- You guys, careful.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.416
- Whoa.
- (Photographer gasps)

09:28.416 --> 09:31.166
- You, okay? Geez you guys!

09:31.166 --> 09:33.208
Ryan: Josh, let the woman
do her job, okay?

09:33.208 --> 09:34.750
- Why don't we get those
bike pictures you wanted.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.291
I was thinking a couple of you
with your boys around.

09:37.291 --> 09:40.083
Josh: Yeah.
- Why don't you come too.

09:40.083 --> 09:42.291
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.333
- It would make Sam happy.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.166
- (Hesitant agreement)

09:46.166 --> 09:48.083
- This bike kicks ass.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.625
- Hey Josh, do you mind
if I ask you

09:50.625 --> 09:52.666
a couple of questions
for my speech?
- Sure.

09:52.666 --> 09:54.416
- Uh, okay.

09:54.416 --> 09:56.291
Tell me about the first day
that you met Sam.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.416
- Um... don't remember.

09:58.416 --> 10:00.666
- Um, okay. Uh...

10:00.666 --> 10:04.750
Is there a moment or even a day,

10:04.750 --> 10:06.833
when you realized
that you loved her?

10:06.833 --> 10:10.291
What, like, an exact day?
I don't know.

10:10.291 --> 10:13.250
Hey! I want one with Erica
and me on the bike

10:13.250 --> 10:15.708
with, uh, my guys around.

10:15.708 --> 10:17.458
- Why? I mean, I just--

10:17.458 --> 10:19.125
I really don't think that's,
like, appropriate.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.416
- Oh, come on,
Sam's gonna love it.

10:20.416 --> 10:21.916
It works for me too.

10:21.916 --> 10:24.583
Nothing hotter than
a chick on a bike.

10:24.583 --> 10:28.500
Come on. Please, come on.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.625
Uh...! It's a little weird,
but okay fine.

10:30.625 --> 10:34.458
I mean, if you think that Sam
will get a kick out of it.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.333
(Erica grunts)
- We're good?

10:37.333 --> 10:38.833
Erica: Okay, just be careful.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.500
- Whoa! (Drink splatters)
(Shocked gasps)

10:40.500 --> 10:46.000
- Josh.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.708
- Shit!

10:48.708 --> 10:51.166
Barb: Hold still for the
oxi-clean.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.833
This stuff's magic.

10:52.833 --> 10:54.250
- I'm telling you soda water
and lemon juice

10:54.250 --> 10:55.833
will take it right out.

10:55.833 --> 10:58.125
- I am not letting you put lemon
juice on her dress, Roberta.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.833
- It's not that bad.
No one will ever notice.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.541
- Gary, get out of the kitchen.

11:01.541 --> 11:06.166
- You guys...
Sam: Erica? Can you come
to my room?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.666
- (whispers) Okay, Lisa.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.083
Go upstairs and find out
what she needs,

11:09.083 --> 11:11.125
but just not a word
about this, okay?

11:11.125 --> 11:12.708
- I'm not good at lying.

11:12.708 --> 11:14.625
(Whispers) Lisa!

11:14.625 --> 11:16.291
- Oh my God.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.041
- Maybe she should try
wearing it inside out?

11:18.041 --> 11:19.541
- Are you insane?

11:19.541 --> 11:22.458
- Mom. Hand me the scissors.
- No.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.333
- Yes. Hand me the scissors.

11:24.333 --> 11:28.541
- (Hurried footsteps clomp)

11:28.541 --> 11:30.958
- What's going on?
- Everything's fine.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.416
They're taking care of it.
Did you need something?

11:33.416 --> 11:37.583
- Taking care of what?
- Nothing.

11:37.583 --> 11:41.708
- Can you cut a straight line?

11:41.708 --> 11:45.583
You can do it.

11:45.583 --> 11:50.458
Okay.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.583
Oh my God.
Roberta: It's so much better.

11:52.583 --> 11:55.166
- Sam, just stay, stay in there.

11:55.166 --> 11:56.708
Sam, don't!

11:56.708 --> 11:58.083
Gary: All the shouting
and screaming,

11:58.083 --> 11:59.416
It's worse than cousin
Max's bris.

11:59.416 --> 12:00.875
- 'Kay, so how does it look?

12:00.875 --> 12:02.375
- Oh, it's much better,
in my opinion.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.583
- How many times do I have
to tell you to stay outside?

12:04.583 --> 12:05.750
- What happened? (Gasps)

12:05.750 --> 12:07.166
What are you doing in here?

12:07.166 --> 12:08.583
You're not supposed to see me.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.500
- Oh. No, I didn't see anything.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.000
- You did.
- Okay, I saw your hair.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.333
And now I know what you're
going to look like at...

12:14.333 --> 12:16.250
at your mom's age.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.000
(Both gasp)

12:18.000 --> 12:19.666
- He gave me the same hair
as you?

12:19.666 --> 12:21.583
- Oh, no.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.500
(Worried tone) Oh, no.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.125
- Sam.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.791
- Sweetheart.

12:26.791 --> 12:33.583
- Well, it wouldn't be a wedding
without a little drama.

12:33.583 --> 12:36.291
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:36.291 --> 12:40.625
- Hey. Okay, come here and sit,
I am going to fix your hair.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.666
Sit, sit, sit.

12:43.666 --> 12:47.583
Okay.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.333
It's gonna be fine, Sam.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.750
We're gonna figure out
the pictures, right?

12:50.750 --> 12:52.750
I'll, um, I'm gonna stand
behind mom

12:52.750 --> 12:56.666
and you won't see a thing.
I promise, okay?

12:56.666 --> 12:59.583
All right, let's see here...

12:59.583 --> 13:01.000
Just take this piece down.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.500
-(Sniffs)
- Let's see.

13:05.500 --> 13:09.208
We put that to the side.
I think it looks really pretty.

13:09.208 --> 13:10.750
Okay, and... Hmm?

13:10.750 --> 13:14.875
As for the Barbara Strange
hair, let's see.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.291
Take this out.

13:17.291 --> 13:18.875
And... voila.

13:18.875 --> 13:22.375
I mean, what do you think?

13:22.375 --> 13:28.291
It's much better. Thanks.
- 'Kay. (laughs)

13:28.291 --> 13:30.666
Oh, Sam, you're still not happy.

13:30.666 --> 13:32.666
I mean, what can I do
to make you happy?

13:32.666 --> 13:34.666
Is it, is it my dress?

13:34.666 --> 13:38.333
- No. No.

13:38.333 --> 13:41.666
It's not the dress, it's...

13:41.666 --> 13:45.583
I just... (sniffs)
- Yeah.

13:45.583 --> 13:49.208
- I have this horrible feeling
in my stomach and...

13:49.208 --> 13:51.875
I don't know if it's nerves or,

13:51.875 --> 13:54.541
something more.

13:54.541 --> 13:56.916
Tell me that I'm crazy.

13:56.916 --> 13:59.625
That... (sniffs)
everything's gonna be fine.

13:59.625 --> 14:02.875
Just tell me I'm doing
the right thing.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.583
- You mean what I...

14:04.583 --> 14:06.833
What are you saying, Sam,
are you having doubts?

14:06.833 --> 14:08.958
- I need you to convince me
right now

14:08.958 --> 14:14.416
that I'm doing the right thing
marrying Josh.

14:14.416 --> 14:17.541
- Sam...

14:17.541 --> 14:20.333
I...

14:20.333 --> 14:23.208
I...

14:23.208 --> 14:26.166
I just don't...

14:26.166 --> 14:28.791
People have doubts
all the time, right?

14:28.791 --> 14:32.666
I mean, if... everybody gets
cold feet.

14:32.666 --> 14:34.833
Yeah, I know. (sniffs)

14:34.833 --> 14:37.791
You're right. It's normal.

14:37.791 --> 14:39.541
It's just the stress
of everything.

14:39.541 --> 14:41.833
Of course. Of course.

14:41.833 --> 14:45.416
(Sniffles)

14:45.416 --> 14:47.000
After this is all over,
we should go for drinks

14:47.000 --> 14:49.375
and laugh about how insane
I was.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.500
- (Laughs)

14:51.500 --> 14:55.458
- This looks good.

14:55.458 --> 15:00.208
Go downstairs. People are going
to start arriving soon.

15:00.208 --> 15:03.250
- Are you sure?

15:03.250 --> 15:11.958
- Mm-hmm.

15:11.958 --> 15:14.125
Erica.

15:14.125 --> 15:17.625
Tell Josh I'm sorry
for freaking out, okay?

15:17.625 --> 15:20.458
- Okay.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.291
(Door opens)

15:23.291 --> 15:25.875
Oh, thank you.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.791
- "The most exhausting thing
in life is being insincere."

15:28.791 --> 15:32.041
Anne Morrow Lindbergh.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.416
(Doorknob rattles, door shuts)

15:33.416 --> 15:35.041
- I'm not being insincere.

15:35.041 --> 15:37.583
I am doing my job
as maid of honor

15:37.583 --> 15:39.333
to help my sister have
the wedding

15:39.333 --> 15:40.833
that she has always wanted.

15:40.833 --> 15:42.583
- Did you know the custom
of bride's maids

15:42.583 --> 15:45.166
originated in ancient Rome?
It says in here,

15:45.166 --> 15:47.666
that apparently the reason
they were all dressed the same

15:47.666 --> 15:50.083
was in order to ward off
evil spirits.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.791
That's interesting, no?

15:51.791 --> 15:54.166
That your job is to protect
the bride.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.750
- No offense, but I really don't
want a history lesson please.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.833
Just... send me back.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.583
- Okay.

16:01.583 --> 16:02.916
Any idea where you might be
going?

16:02.916 --> 16:04.666
- August 2003:

16:04.666 --> 16:06.375
Getting Sam and Josh back
together.

16:06.375 --> 16:08.041
- Wow, good guess.

16:08.041 --> 16:10.291
So, what happened?

16:10.291 --> 16:12.083
- All right, um...

16:12.083 --> 16:14.083
I'd invited Sam and Josh
over for dinner

16:14.083 --> 16:16.958
to celebrate her first day
of residency.

16:16.958 --> 16:18.583
And Josh, he showed up
an hour late,

16:18.583 --> 16:20.541
and Sam wanted to kill him,

16:20.541 --> 16:22.500
and it just, (sigh of disgust)

16:22.500 --> 16:24.666
degenerated from there.

16:26.208 --> 16:28.083
He broke up with her
on the spot.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.000
It was the one and only time
that they had ever split.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.500
And even though I secretly knew
and felt it was for the best,

16:36.500 --> 16:38.750
I just, I couldn't stand
to see Sam upset. So...

16:40.208 --> 16:42.041
The next day I showed up
on his doorstep

16:43.291 --> 16:45.041
and I convinced him that
he was making a mistake.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.166
That... you know,
that it wasn't worth it.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.166
All the years that
they had together.

16:49.166 --> 16:50.833
And (exhales) oh, I just...

16:50.833 --> 16:53.666
I so wish that I would've
stayed out of it.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.291
I mean, they broken up.

16:55.291 --> 16:57.125
They were over.
And... now it's too late.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.583
I mean, she's getting married
in a few hours

16:58.583 --> 17:00.583
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

17:00.583 --> 17:03.041
- It's never too late.

17:03.041 --> 17:04.958
What? You had a chance?

17:04.958 --> 17:08.000
Just now, to tell her how you
feel, but you didn't. Why?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.875
- Erica:

17:09.875 --> 17:12.791
you don't tell someone that
they might be making a mistake

17:12.791 --> 17:14.291
on their wedding day.

17:14.291 --> 17:16.666
- Oh, I see. Is that because
it's not convenient,

17:16.666 --> 17:18.708
or because it's not true?

17:18.708 --> 17:20.125
- Well, you, you don't know
my sister,

17:20.125 --> 17:22.708
she was not asking
for the truth.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.916
She wanted reassurance.
- Hmm?

17:24.916 --> 17:26.416
And you just gave her that.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.125
But now you're telling me
you wanna go back in time

17:28.125 --> 17:29.625
and break them up.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.083
So, I'm sorry, I'm a little
confused.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.208
- Look, Sam and Josh broke up,

17:33.208 --> 17:35.041
and it would've stayed that way
if I hadn't and interfered.

17:35.041 --> 17:36.958
So, if I could do it over,

17:36.958 --> 17:38.625
I would stay out of it
and let it end

17:40.125 --> 17:42.625
the way it should have.

17:42.625 --> 17:44.583
(Book thuds)

17:47.166 --> 17:48.666
(Erica squeals, tray clangs)

17:48.666 --> 17:50.041
Uh... Heh...

17:51.625 --> 17:53.166
Woops.

17:53.166 --> 17:54.500
- You'd think that tonight
of all nights,

17:54.500 --> 17:56.083
you'd actually be on time.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.291
- I told you, there was
an accident on Bloor.

17:58.291 --> 18:01.083
An accident? What was it,
like, a 50 car pile up?

18:01.083 --> 18:03.166
- Here Sam...
- No, it was a car
and a motorcycle.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.916
And all four lanes
were shut down.

18:04.916 --> 18:07.541
- And who takes Bloor street
in rush hour?

18:07.541 --> 18:09.375
Not unless...
- Oh, unless what?

18:10.875 --> 18:12.666
- You know what? Or who?

18:12.666 --> 18:14.958
- You read into everything.
- I'm not.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.541
- I can't take a dump
without you mentioning Laura.

18:16.541 --> 18:18.000
How many times I gotta tell you?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.791
Nothing is going on.
- Whatever, Josh.

18:19.791 --> 18:21.833
I'm sure that's true, just like
I'm sure there was an accident.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.208
- Oh, God.
- Anyone up for seconds?

18:25.208 --> 18:29.208
- Not until your sister stops
acting like a total bitch.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.958
- I'm sorry, Erica,
Josh doesn't seem to be able
to control himself.

18:31.958 --> 18:33.916
- Oh, that's right, take
the high road around Erica,

18:33.916 --> 18:35.458
then accuse me of cheating
as soon as we're alone.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.125
- Just drop it already!

18:39.083 --> 18:40.750
- (Sighs)

18:45.291 --> 18:48.666
Sorry, Erica.
Sam... I can't do this.

18:48.666 --> 18:50.041
(Half laughs) This is endless.

18:50.041 --> 18:53.083
- It is endless. Sam...

18:53.083 --> 18:55.500
this relationship...

18:55.500 --> 18:57.458
it's not what I want.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.583
It's done. We're done.

19:01.583 --> 19:04.625

Josh!

19:11.083 --> 19:12.916
(Exhales) Did he...

19:16.250 --> 19:18.083
Did he just...

19:18.083 --> 19:20.958
Did he just break up with me?

19:23.708 --> 19:25.083
You can't just end things
like that.

19:25.083 --> 19:27.916
That's not the way you end
things.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.166
- Hey, Sam. It's gonna be okay.

- Hey.

19:46.666 --> 19:48.250
- I got all your favorites.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.583
I got doritos, wasabi peas.
How are you feeling?

19:52.166 --> 19:54.541
- Good. Really good.
- Really?

19:54.541 --> 19:57.083
- Definitely. Where's the comet?

19:57.083 --> 19:58.708
- You don't have to clean.

19:58.708 --> 20:00.166
- (Scoffs) No, it's fine.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.166
I have all this energy.
It's really weird.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.958
It's like I feel so awake
and alive.

20:04.958 --> 20:06.541
That must mean it was the right
thing, right?

20:06.541 --> 20:08.166
- Oh, definitely.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.500
- I mean, I know he's been
cheating on me for months,

20:10.500 --> 20:13.416
and we barely talk,
we definitely don't have sex.

20:13.416 --> 20:15.208
He called this morning,
he wants me to, uh,

20:15.208 --> 20:17.958
Go to his apartment
and pick up my stuff.

20:17.958 --> 20:20.375
I should go do that.
Get it over with.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.208
- Yeah, um, do you want me
to come with you?

20:23.791 --> 20:25.750
- Would you?
- Of course. Yes.

20:27.250 --> 20:29.041
Definitely.

20:29.041 --> 20:30.583
Thanks.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.666
- Breakfast?

20:36.916 --> 20:38.916
(Door shuts, keys jingle)

20:40.541 --> 20:42.916
- Oh, you know what, Sam?
I forgot my cell phone.

20:42.916 --> 20:44.291
Do you wanna go grab a cab?

20:44.291 --> 20:45.958
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.333

20:58.333 --> 21:00.333

- (Half laughs) Yeah.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.500
I'm a real perfectionist
when it comes to paint.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.125

I have to just...

21:04.125 --> 21:05.875

21:05.875 --> 21:07.875
Oh, and then I start...
picking away at it,

21:07.875 --> 21:10.250
and before you know it,
the whole thing's a big mess.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.875
- I'm not getting in there,

21:11.875 --> 21:13.708
just so you know,
I'm not getting involved.

21:13.708 --> 21:15.000
- I didn't say you were.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.583
- Staying out of it
like I said I would.

21:16.583 --> 21:17.916
You know, said I wasn't gonna
do it.

21:17.916 --> 21:19.625
And it was Sam's idea
to go pick up her stuff.

21:19.625 --> 21:20.833
I'm, I'm just along
for the ride.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.750
Sounds like it may be
quite a ride.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.458
And I will deal with it.
I mean...

21:24.458 --> 21:26.666
I need to do what's best
for Sam.

21:26.666 --> 21:28.125
- Yes, you do.

21:28.125 --> 21:29.833
Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

21:29.833 --> 21:31.916

bird mug...

I did this morning...

22:56.208 --> 22:57.791
I don't know.

out of here, okay?

goodbye.

about the blackout?

31:12.416 --> 31:14.416
Like you did the right thing?

31:14.416 --> 31:16.583
- Yeah. I think so.
- Good.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.708
- I'm just gonna say this.

31:22.708 --> 31:25.500
We used to hang out more.
Remember?

31:25.500 --> 31:27.958
We used to do this all the time.

31:27.958 --> 31:29.875
What happened?

31:29.875 --> 31:31.875
- I don't know.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.666
- When we were little,

31:36.666 --> 31:38.750
we would tell each other
everything.

31:38.750 --> 31:41.541
And... then we just stopped.

31:41.541 --> 31:43.791
I mean, I feel like today
has been the first day

31:43.791 --> 31:45.875
in a really long time that
you've been honest with me.

31:48.500 --> 31:51.541
And I miss it.

31:51.541 --> 31:54.875
Keep doing it, okay?

31:54.875 --> 31:56.916
Promise?
- Okay.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.916
Sam.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.250
(Composing breaths)

32:08.458 --> 32:10.500
(Low hum of guest chatter)

32:13.291 --> 32:15.416
Sam?

32:15.416 --> 32:16.875
Sam!

32:16.875 --> 32:18.208
- Erica! I'm up here!

32:19.708 --> 32:21.708
(Footsteps clomp)

32:25.000 --> 32:26.916
- What do you think?

32:26.916 --> 32:28.666
Too princess Diana, right?

32:28.666 --> 32:30.666
I know, tiara's are cheesy,
but...

32:32.708 --> 32:35.500
do I look okay?

32:35.500 --> 32:37.541
- You look like someone
that's about to get married.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.541
(emotional)
And you look beautiful.

32:41.541 --> 32:44.041
- You look like someone who
needs to lay off the sangria.

32:44.041 --> 32:46.458
I'm the one who's supposed
to be nervous here.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.458
Is Josh ready?

32:48.458 --> 32:50.666
- (Small squeak)

32:50.666 --> 32:52.958
- Oh my God, can you believe
I'm getting married today?

32:56.416 --> 32:58.291
(Low hum of guest chatter)

33:05.958 --> 33:07.333
- What is going on,
they're still getting married?

33:07.333 --> 33:09.625
Nothing has changed.

33:09.625 --> 33:11.500
- Oh, well, the day after
the black out,

33:11.500 --> 33:13.708
Josh showed up with flowers
and... (inhales)

33:13.708 --> 33:15.333
Sam took him back
pretty much immediately.

33:16.875 --> 33:18.000
The heart wants what it wants.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.708
- No, but this has nothing
to do with heart.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.458
He's just using her
because he's,

33:21.458 --> 33:22.625
he's too lazy
or he's too scared.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.541
- Or maybe the next day
he woke up and realized

33:24.541 --> 33:26.416
he was madly in love with Sam.

33:26.416 --> 33:27.958
- Yeah, well, what are
the chances of that?

33:27.958 --> 33:29.791
- Hm.

33:29.791 --> 33:31.791
One way to find out, I guess.

33:31.791 --> 33:33.583
- (Frustrated exhales)

33:37.083 --> 33:38.833
(Footsteps clomp against deck,
wedding guests chatter)

33:41.041 --> 33:42.958
Hey.

33:42.958 --> 33:45.500
Are you excited?

33:45.500 --> 33:47.166
- Yup.
- No, I mean it, Josh.

33:47.166 --> 33:49.875
Are you excited to be getting
married?

33:49.875 --> 33:51.458
Are you happy?

33:51.458 --> 33:53.708
- (Sighs) I'm really drunk
right now.

33:53.708 --> 33:55.291
Are you sure you want me
to answer that question?

33:56.791 --> 33:58.375
- Yeah, I'm sure.

34:00.166 --> 34:03.375
Even if you might not
like the answer?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.625
Ethan: Erica?

34:08.166 --> 34:10.041
Claire: Hey.
Erica: Hey. Hey.

34:11.541 --> 34:13.125
Are you guys having fun?

34:13.125 --> 34:14.916
- Except for that little moment
with your mom. (laughs)

34:14.916 --> 34:17.125
- Yeah, she was asking a lot
of questions about the divorce.

34:17.125 --> 34:19.750
It was very awkward.
- No, it was fine.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.583
I just told her the truth.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.833
We've patched things up.

34:24.833 --> 34:27.375
Good as new.

34:27.375 --> 34:28.791
- That's great.

34:28.791 --> 34:31.000
- Yeah, it is.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.708
You know what? We should get
some champagne and celebrate.

34:32.708 --> 34:33.375
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:33.375 --> 34:36.083
Look, I'll meet you over
at the bar in just a minute,
all right?

34:36.083 --> 34:37.875
- Okay.

34:40.958 --> 34:43.125
- So, Ryan seems like
a really nice guy.

34:43.125 --> 34:46.750
Seems into you.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.416
Erica, what's wrong?

34:48.416 --> 34:50.000
- Nothing.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.708
- Are you upset about Claire?

34:51.708 --> 34:53.916
Or what happened between us?

34:53.916 --> 34:55.958
I mean, are things weird now
or...

34:55.958 --> 34:58.416
- No, no, no, it has nothing
to do with that at all.

34:58.416 --> 35:00.666
It's Josh.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.291
- Oh.

35:02.291 --> 35:04.125
- I know that this wedding
is a terrible mistake.

35:04.125 --> 35:05.833
And I feel like...

35:05.833 --> 35:10.000
I have spent so long trying
to protect Sam from pain

35:10.000 --> 35:11.833
and now, I can't seem to find
a way out of it.

35:13.416 --> 35:14.791
- Erica, you need to make
a choice.

35:14.791 --> 35:16.208
So, just think about Sam,

35:16.208 --> 35:18.291
think about what's best for her

35:18.291 --> 35:20.750
and you'll know what to do.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.458
Come here.

35:29.125 --> 35:30.833
(Knocking on door,
door clicks open)

35:30.833 --> 35:32.791
- Hi.

35:32.791 --> 35:35.041
- Hey, where have you been?

35:35.041 --> 35:37.750
- Um... would you ladies give
us a few minutes please?

35:40.875 --> 35:42.916
Can you close the door please?
Thanks.

35:42.916 --> 35:44.500
- What happened?

35:44.500 --> 35:46.000
Don't tell me, it's something
with the cake.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.875
- No-no-no-no, it has nothing
to do with the cake, Sam.

35:47.875 --> 35:49.875
Um... but have a seat, okay?

35:53.750 --> 35:56.416
So, you know how there are some
things that you just don't say.

35:57.875 --> 35:59.875
I, um... I have to say
one of those things.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.208
- You're scaring me.

36:03.208 --> 36:05.166
- The night of the blackout.

36:05.166 --> 36:07.708
Do you remember the promise
that we made to each other?

36:07.708 --> 36:09.666
That we would always
tell each other how we felt,

36:09.666 --> 36:12.041
and we wouldn't hold
anything back?

36:12.041 --> 36:13.833
Do you remember that?

36:13.833 --> 36:15.583
- Um... vaguely.

36:17.083 --> 36:19.083
- Okay, well, um...

36:19.083 --> 36:20.958
I broke my promise to you
that night

36:20.958 --> 36:22.875
because I didn't want
to hurt you.

36:22.875 --> 36:24.750
I wanted to protect you,

36:24.750 --> 36:27.416
and I've watched you struggle

36:27.416 --> 36:29.791
to make your relationship
with Josh work

36:29.791 --> 36:32.541
and, um, seeing that you
had doubts this morning,

36:34.083 --> 36:35.875
it just, it made me sick.

36:35.875 --> 36:38.208
Because I, I just know,

36:38.208 --> 36:40.291
and I've always known that...

36:40.291 --> 36:42.375
Josh isn't right for you.

36:42.375 --> 36:45.125
And I know that today of all
days is not the day to be
saying it,

36:45.125 --> 36:46.583
and I tried to keep it to myself

36:46.583 --> 36:49.041
because I didn't want
to hurt you,

36:49.041 --> 36:51.666
but I realized that
by keeping it to myself,

36:51.666 --> 36:54.083
I am hurting you.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.958
So, I just have to say it, Sam.

36:57.458 --> 36:58.750
Please don't marry Josh.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.916
He can't make you happy.

37:01.916 --> 37:04.291
He doesn't make you happy.

37:04.291 --> 37:06.250
I mean, you... (gasps)

37:06.250 --> 37:10.291
you deserve to be with someone
that really loves you

37:10.291 --> 37:12.208
and that shows it to you
in everything that he does.

37:14.708 --> 37:16.958
Josh is not that guy.

37:18.541 --> 37:20.208
(Knocking on door,
door clicks open)

37:20.208 --> 37:22.208
- Come on, girls, it's time.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.375
What's wrong?

37:26.375 --> 37:28.250
- Nothing's wrong. Can you give
us a second please?

37:30.875 --> 37:33.541
(Door shuts)

37:36.541 --> 37:38.541
Um...

37:40.083 --> 37:42.958
You're gonna to head downstairs,

37:42.958 --> 37:46.083
and you're gonna watch me
walk down the aisle, and...

37:49.375 --> 37:51.916
you're gonna stand beside me
at my wedding.

37:56.166 --> 37:59.125
- (to self) Sam.

37:59.125 --> 38:01.083
Oh, Sam.

38:03.916 --> 38:05.958
- Mom, we're ready.

38:14.041 --> 38:16.291
(Wedding music plays)

38:16.291 --> 38:18.833
(Camera shutters click,
low hum of chatter)

38:21.000 --> 38:22.583
(Low hum of chatter)

38:26.333 --> 38:28.750
(Camera shutter clicks,
low hum of chatter)

38:44.375 --> 38:46.041
Rabbi: Welcome everyone to the
wedding of Josh and Samantha.

38:49.541 --> 38:52.375
As we travel together over
the peaks,

38:52.375 --> 38:54.333
plateaus and valleys of life,

38:56.291 --> 38:58.333
may the journey be a joyful
and fulfilling one.

39:01.333 --> 39:03.083
I would like to ask the family
to declare the support

39:04.791 --> 39:06.333
for the couple,

39:06.333 --> 39:09.333
To help them build a healthy
marriage...

39:12.041 --> 39:13.958
(Camera shutters click)

39:19.500 --> 39:21.291
(Glass shatters)
Guests: Mazel Tov!

39:21.291 --> 39:23.291
Guests: (Applaud and holler)

39:23.291 --> 39:25.791
(Kiss)

39:25.791 --> 39:28.333
(Whistle and applaud)

39:31.666 --> 39:34.083
(Kiss)

39:34.083 --> 39:35.958
Samantha: (Laughs giddily)
Ryan: (Embracing grunt)

39:40.875 --> 39:42.708
- Sam. Sam, I'm sorry--

39:44.333 --> 39:46.416
- I'm not very interested
in hearing your speech

39:46.416 --> 39:48.208
and after tonight, I never want
to talk to you again.

39:53.750 --> 39:56.000
(Rabbi sings and guest clap)

40:01.875 --> 40:04.958
(Guests cheer and holler)

40:14.250 --> 40:17.250
Erica: The heart wants
what it wants.

40:17.250 --> 40:19.083
It forces us to act
when reason dictates otherwise.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.375
It tears down walls,

40:23.375 --> 40:26.000
breaches boundaries,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.291
and for better or for worse,

40:28.291 --> 40:30.291
It leads us places that
the head would never go.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.500
♪ ♪

40:42.750 --> 40:44.166
(Knock on door)

40:44.166 --> 40:46.791
- Uh, yeah.

40:46.791 --> 40:48.375
- Everyone's looking for you,
you gotta do your speech.

40:48.375 --> 40:51.000
- Uh... you know what?
Actually, I'm just,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.458
I'm not feeling well
right now, Ryan.

40:53.458 --> 40:55.958
So, um... Sam knows.

40:55.958 --> 40:57.625
Uh, she understand.

40:57.625 --> 40:59.166
I, I'm not gonna do the speech.

41:02.125 --> 41:05.583
- Is there anything I can do?
- No.

41:05.583 --> 41:07.458
I just need a few minutes
to myself.

41:10.041 --> 41:11.458
Please.

41:14.916 --> 41:16.375
Thanks.

41:18.333 --> 41:19.750
(Door shuts, Erica exhales)

41:23.000 --> 41:26.166
(Crying)

41:33.125 --> 41:35.375
Please go away.

41:35.375 --> 41:37.500
I can't handle you pointing out
how right you were.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.250
Because you were.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.500
I never should have got
involved.

41:44.500 --> 41:47.291
I didn't help Sam,

41:47.291 --> 41:49.250
I didn't stop her from marrying
a guy who doesn't love her,

41:51.083 --> 41:52.958
and I just hurt her.

41:52.958 --> 41:54.375
And for nothing.

41:54.375 --> 41:56.375
Dr. Tom: No.

41:56.375 --> 41:58.416
No, not for nothing.

41:58.416 --> 42:01.458
You didn't choose the easy road.

42:01.458 --> 42:03.291
You did your job.

42:06.083 --> 42:09.125
The maid of honor is charged
with protecting the bride

42:09.125 --> 42:12.208
and that's exactly
what you tried to do.

42:12.208 --> 42:14.916
You put everything on the line
for your sister's happiness.

42:17.083 --> 42:18.666
Now, doing the right thing,

42:18.666 --> 42:21.500
doesn't always guarantee
a happy ending.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.250
- But the ending is all that
matters.

42:23.250 --> 42:26.000
It's, it's the whole point.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.083
I mean, so what if I did
the right thing

42:28.083 --> 42:31.416
if I couldn't stop Sam
from marrying Josh,

42:31.416 --> 42:33.125
I mean, what difference
does it make?

42:33.125 --> 42:35.500
- All the difference
in the world.

42:35.500 --> 42:36.958
(Muted chatter and laughter,
camera clicks)
