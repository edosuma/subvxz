A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

01:58.291 --> 02:00.375
-Hello, Andrea.
<i>-Hello, Jon.</i>

02:00.458 --> 02:02.791
<i>Are you with David?</i>
<i>He's not picking up.</i>

02:02.875 --> 02:05.500
No, I'm waiting outside.
I think he was in a meeting.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.250
<i>What nerve.</i>

02:07.416 --> 02:10.208
<i>If he's not out in five minutes,</i>
<i>drag him out by the hair.</i>

02:10.791 --> 02:11.625
Okay.

02:11.833 --> 02:14.375
<i>And can you get some ice</i>
<i>from the 24-hour store?</i>

02:14.458 --> 02:16.791
<i>Your buddy can't do without</i>
<i>his gin and tonic.</i>

02:16.875 --> 02:18.291
Whatever you say, boss.

02:18.375 --> 02:20.958
<i>Go on, don't be long. Big kiss.</i>

02:21.416 --> 02:22.833
See you soon. Big kiss.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.333
That's it, Jon. Let's go.

02:34.416 --> 02:35.833
Thirty-two minutes late.

02:35.916 --> 02:37.875
Sorry. I'll tell you later. Go.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.708
I need some ice
from the 24-hour store.

02:40.875 --> 02:41.750
And champagne.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.291
No shit. You're going to ask her?

03:03.250 --> 03:04.291
Tonight?

03:04.375 --> 03:05.750
Sure, with you there.

03:06.833 --> 03:10.666
Fuck, no. I'll tell her we're spending
the weekend in Paris.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.041
That's great. Paris.

03:12.416 --> 03:14.583
Yes. I'll propose to her in Paris.

03:14.666 --> 03:15.583
She'll love it.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.708
I'm happy for you. For both of you.

03:18.791 --> 03:19.625
I know.

03:23.125 --> 03:25.333
And you know who's going to be
my best man?

03:25.416 --> 03:28.375
-If she says yes.
-Shit, man. Can you imagine?

03:28.500 --> 03:31.958
Kneeling under the Eiffel Tower like:
"Will you marry me?"

03:32.166 --> 03:33.750
"Well, no.

03:34.458 --> 03:35.916
Fuck off!"

03:36.500 --> 03:37.333
Stop kidding!

04:04.291 --> 04:05.125
I'll go.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.166
-Want anything?
-Don't forget the ice. Thanks.

04:56.416 --> 04:57.791
24-HOUR STORE

05:18.208 --> 05:19.375
David.

05:20.625 --> 05:21.458
David.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.083
David.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.125
David!

05:31.500 --> 05:32.583
Call an ambulance!

05:36.250 --> 05:37.166
Call an ambulance!

05:42.458 --> 05:45.041
INCOMING CALL
ANDREA

05:48.500 --> 05:49.500
David...

06:35.625 --> 06:39.625
10 YEARS LATER

06:45.416 --> 06:47.458
A guy was killed in there ten years ago.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.791
There was blood
and bits of brain on the floor.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.083
I heard it was a shooting.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.250
And two guys died.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.833
Look.

07:00.916 --> 07:02.333
He's gonna piss himself.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.041
For me.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.875
Now go inside the store
and get us a porn mag.

07:12.625 --> 07:13.541
Go on, move it!

07:42.583 --> 07:43.875
-Move it!
-Go!

08:02.916 --> 08:04.833
Nico, what are you doing here?

08:04.916 --> 08:06.916
I waited for you at school
for half an hour!

08:15.291 --> 08:16.375
Are you all right?

08:16.708 --> 08:17.666
Sorry, Mom.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.333
Go on, get in.

08:27.833 --> 08:28.833
Where's your bag?

08:29.250 --> 08:31.458
At school, I don't have any homework.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.416
This is the last time you leave
without telling me.

08:35.791 --> 08:37.207
Go on, put on your seat belt.

09:21.916 --> 09:22.750
Okay.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.208
How is he?

09:27.000 --> 09:31.166
In a coma. They're going to do
some brain activity tests on him,

09:31.458 --> 09:33.208
we'll have the results in the morning.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.625
My brother's not going without a fight.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.375
-Can I see him?
-One second.

09:41.208 --> 09:42.333
Did you see who did it?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.625
I saw someone leave,
but not his face. It was so fast.

09:46.708 --> 09:47.541
He ran off?

09:48.625 --> 09:49.833
No, he got in a car.

09:50.083 --> 09:53.250
-Anything else?
-There was another man inside.

09:54.541 --> 09:57.583
He was... I don't know,
from the East or Russian.

09:57.666 --> 10:00.041
He had a tattoo here and he was hurt.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.208
He pointed a gun at me

10:02.541 --> 10:03.375
and left.

10:03.916 --> 10:05.958
We'll get the fucker who did this.

10:07.208 --> 10:08.375
-Let's go.
-Yes.

10:21.375 --> 10:22.208
My love... My darling...

10:26.708 --> 10:28.250
You have to fight. Please.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.750
Don't leave me alone. Please.

10:37.166 --> 10:38.208
Please hold on.

10:38.916 --> 10:40.666
Please hold on.

10:50.708 --> 10:51.750
He can't die.

11:03.416 --> 11:04.750
He's not going to die.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.375
You owe us a mag, asshole!

11:35.333 --> 11:36.166
Hey!

11:37.875 --> 11:39.166
Don't forget it, dickhead!

11:43.291 --> 11:44.500
Mom!

11:44.583 --> 11:45.416
Mom, let's go. Let's go.

11:52.583 --> 11:55.250
-You have to defend yourself.
-They're older than me.

11:55.333 --> 11:59.125
If they insult or hit you,
tell the teacher, or I will.

11:59.208 --> 12:02.416
I'm not a snitch, Mom.
Please don't talk to the school.

12:03.458 --> 12:06.166
Unless you defend yourself,
they'll keep messing with you.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.875
And they'll take your backpack.

12:19.750 --> 12:23.000
I have to get gas.
Go get a shake, I'll be right there.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.458
What are you doing?

13:23.250 --> 13:26.208
Aren't you a bit young
to be stealing porn mags?

13:36.291 --> 13:37.375
How old are you?

13:38.458 --> 13:39.875
I'll be 10 next week.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.458
Please don't tell my mother.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.125
Don't worry. Thanks.

14:13.708 --> 14:15.375
Nico, did you get the shake?

14:15.750 --> 14:16.583
Not yet.

14:17.458 --> 14:18.666
What are you waiting for?

14:21.583 --> 14:23.083
How much is it? Number 7.

14:23.541 --> 14:26.666
That's 30 euros for the gas
and the magazine.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.166
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.125
Do you come to this store a lot?

14:41.666 --> 14:42.791
No.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.875
It looked like the owner knew you.
What were you talking about?

14:47.458 --> 14:50.083
Did you know a guy
got killed in there ten years ago?

14:50.666 --> 14:52.166
They blew his brains out.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.583
-Who told you that?
-Some kids from school.

14:57.166 --> 14:58.125
Is it true?

14:59.208 --> 15:01.083
The same ones that were picking on you?

15:03.541 --> 15:05.791
I'm sure they made it up to scare you.

15:19.791 --> 15:21.291
It's a positive response.

15:21.375 --> 15:22.791
We're optimistic.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.833
But we have to wait.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.500
-It's too soon to tell.
-Excuse me.

15:37.375 --> 15:40.708
The doctor said that a vein
is blocking the temporal lobe

15:40.791 --> 15:43.416
and that may be why
his brain's not reacting.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.583
Can they save him?

15:44.708 --> 15:47.500
Yes. It's a difficult surgery, but yes,

15:47.583 --> 15:50.291
there's a chance
he could come out of the coma.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.125
That's great news.

15:53.041 --> 15:55.125
-When are they operating on him?
-I don't know.

15:55.208 --> 15:56.458
He's still very weak.

15:56.541 --> 16:00.125
They've given him blood transfusions
and they have to watch his progress.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.291
Excuse me.

16:04.041 --> 16:04.875
Marta.

16:05.416 --> 16:08.041
Listen... did you get my message?

16:11.291 --> 16:13.458
SHOOTING IN 24-HOUR STORE

16:14.041 --> 16:15.458
He's still very weak.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.333
Don't tell Mom and Dad yet, okay?

16:23.666 --> 16:25.916
No, don't worry. I'll keep you posted.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.541
TERRORIST ATTACK BY ETA
IN SAME PLACE 32 YEARS AGO

16:30.625 --> 16:31.458
Bye.

16:34.541 --> 16:35.625
Jon.

16:37.791 --> 16:38.833
Jon.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.375
Thirty-two years ago
there was an attack in the same place.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.250
In the 24-hour store?

16:50.041 --> 16:52.541
Go home and get some rest,
you must be exhausted.

16:52.625 --> 16:53.750
No, I'm fine.

16:54.583 --> 16:56.458
Shall we get some dinner or...?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.250
No, I want to spend some time
with David's mother.

17:00.666 --> 17:02.750
Relax. If anything happens
I'll tell you, okay?

17:02.833 --> 17:03.916
-Okay.
-All right.

17:05.708 --> 17:06.583
Thanks.

17:07.665 --> 17:09.333
-Bye.
-Bye.

17:25.665 --> 17:27.915
SAVING A LIFE
LISANDRO LÓPEZ, 10

17:28.000 --> 17:29.333
<i>Ten, 32...</i>

17:29.833 --> 17:31.000
<i>Ten, 32...</i>

17:31.083 --> 17:33.625
GAS STATION
32 YEARS AGO

17:33.708 --> 17:36.416
...A 32-YEAR-OLD MAN
WITH TWO GUNSHOT WOUNDS...

17:36.500 --> 17:38.083
<i>Ten, 32...</i>

17:56.041 --> 17:57.166
Nico, your snack.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.208
Eat up and then finish your homework.

18:21.666 --> 18:22.666
Nico, your snack.

18:38.458 --> 18:39.583
What's wrong, Nico?

18:41.041 --> 18:42.125
Are you all right?

18:51.916 --> 18:52.750
Bastards.

18:54.875 --> 18:55.708
Don't worry.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.041
It's all right.

18:58.791 --> 19:00.166
It's just a sick joke.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.125
Get up, you've had an accident.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.583
Sorry, Mom.

19:16.958 --> 19:18.083
I didn't notice.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.958
Never mind. It's fine.

19:20.583 --> 19:21.708
Go to the bathroom.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.958
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
DON'T GO TO THE 24-HOUR PLACE

19:31.041 --> 19:32.833
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.
IF YOU DO, YOU'LL DIE.

19:32.916 --> 19:36.916
It was in his bag, inside that envelope.
They're making his life impossible.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.791
They pick on him, take his things,
hit him. No one does anything.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.833
I saw it myself the other day.
And now this.

19:42.916 --> 19:46.208
Lucía, we do all we can
to avoid these situations.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.666
I'll find out who these boys are
and I'll talk to them.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.125
It's not about talking.

19:51.625 --> 19:55.666
I won't allow that they do this to my son.
I want them to be punished, expelled.

19:55.750 --> 19:58.583
I understand, but this is a state school.

19:58.791 --> 20:00.958
We can't do anything
without being totally sure.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.125
First, I'd have to talk to Nico.

20:06.208 --> 20:07.458
He won't tell you anything.

20:07.833 --> 20:10.208
He keeps it to himself,
and he's having a rough time.

20:11.166 --> 20:14.416
They're scaring him with the story
of the man killed in the gas station.

20:14.875 --> 20:17.958
And now this letter?
They're harassing him.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.458
Those are harsh words.

20:21.875 --> 20:22.916
Harsh words?

20:28.833 --> 20:31.708
"Whatever happens,
don't go to the 24-hour store

20:32.041 --> 20:35.916
on your birthday, April 12, 2018.
If you do, you'll die."

20:38.750 --> 20:40.041
When Nico read this letter,

20:40.625 --> 20:43.333
he wet himself.
That's never happened to him.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.250
Let's do this. Leave me the note, please.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.333
If they bother Nico again,
he needs to report it.

20:57.541 --> 21:01.833
To the teacher, the head teacher or me.
Otherwise, we can't help him.

21:28.958 --> 21:29.958
Take a good look.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.166
There.

21:40.708 --> 21:42.708
The bullet came from that fucker's gun.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.791
-Did you find out anything else?
-No.

21:46.875 --> 21:50.166
But we'll catch him.
It's a matter of time.

21:51.166 --> 21:53.833
How are the others?
The store guy and the boy.

21:53.916 --> 21:57.291
The owner's all right.
He got a good scare, but...

21:58.500 --> 22:00.958
I'm worried about the boy, he's only 10.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.333
Ten? Yes, why?

22:10.666 --> 22:13.416
Did you know that in 1976
there was an attack there?

22:14.208 --> 22:15.833
And there was a boy, too.

22:16.625 --> 22:17.458
Ten years old.

22:20.291 --> 22:21.958
That's strange. Isn't it?

22:24.166 --> 22:25.000
Pure chance.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.333
Fucking bugs.

23:13.375 --> 23:14.416
What's wrong?

23:14.875 --> 23:17.666
My mom went to talk
to the principal yesterday

23:18.250 --> 23:21.000
and I'm sure I'll get into trouble
with Luis and his friends.

23:25.291 --> 23:26.333
Look.

23:30.166 --> 23:31.000
Let's go.

23:32.625 --> 23:33.708
Whose idea was it?

23:34.875 --> 23:36.250
We didn't do anything.

23:36.541 --> 23:40.166
Sure, the note wrote itself
and magically got into Nico's bag.

23:41.000 --> 23:41.833
Maybe.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.666
Fine. We'll do a handwriting test.

23:45.833 --> 23:48.875
And if the writing on this note
matches any of you,

23:49.333 --> 23:50.791
I'll open a harassment protocol.

23:51.750 --> 23:54.375
And if I find out
you've laid a hand on Nico,

23:55.083 --> 23:57.750
I'll expel the three of you.
Is that clear?

24:00.041 --> 24:01.083
What does the note say?

24:02.333 --> 24:05.791
That if I go to the 24-hour store
on my birthday, I'll die.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.875
-Jon?
-Jon Zárate.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.291
-How are you?
-Nice to meet you.

24:22.375 --> 24:23.833
-Come in.
-Yes.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.000
I made some copies.

24:26.333 --> 24:27.166
Thank you.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.875
See? In 1976 there was no store,

24:31.625 --> 24:33.500
just the pumps and an office.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.458
The official car was here, filling up.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.541
The general was in the back,
reading the paper.

24:39.916 --> 24:43.250
I was with the general's escort
cleaning the windshield.

24:43.708 --> 24:45.250
A beautiful black Dodge.

24:49.125 --> 24:52.041
Then I heard the sound
of a motorbike approaching.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.208
With two men.

24:57.125 --> 25:00.833
Suddenly, the passenger
pulled out a machine-gun.

25:03.458 --> 25:04.708
It all happened so fast.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.916
The escort jumped on me
and covered me with his body.

25:13.208 --> 25:16.166
Meanwhile, the terrorist shot at the car.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.916
When the magazine was empty...

25:24.041 --> 25:27.083
he yelled, "Long live ETA,"
got on the bike and they left.

25:28.416 --> 25:30.083
I tried to move, but I couldn't.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.041
The escort's body was on top of me.

25:37.791 --> 25:38.625
He was dead.

25:40.750 --> 25:44.875
The general was shot several times,
but he was luckier and survived.

25:46.416 --> 25:47.750
I went to the funeral.

25:48.833 --> 25:50.083
I'll never forget it.

25:51.916 --> 25:54.500
The escort's mother came over...

25:56.208 --> 25:59.000
and made me promise
to make the most of my life

25:59.291 --> 26:01.375
so that her son's death
was not in vain.

26:02.750 --> 26:05.750
I'm not a genius or a scientist
or anything, but...

26:06.625 --> 26:09.000
what I make from this business
allows me

26:09.083 --> 26:10.916
to finance some soup kitchens

26:11.500 --> 26:13.708
and some summer camps
for underprivileged kids.

26:14.750 --> 26:16.125
I think I kept my promise.

26:19.208 --> 26:21.166
Why do you want to know all this?

26:21.625 --> 26:24.250
The person who was shot
is my best friend.

26:26.083 --> 26:26.916
I'm sorry.

26:28.625 --> 26:30.500
Don't you think it's strange?

26:32.750 --> 26:33.583
What?

26:33.916 --> 26:36.083
That there were two shootings
in the same place.

26:36.958 --> 26:40.833
In both, five people were present.
In both, a 10-year-old boy.

26:42.416 --> 26:43.625
Yes, it's strange.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.458
PASSIONATE CRIME DURING THE SALE

26:48.541 --> 26:50.041
Because in 1955,

26:50.916 --> 26:52.541
there was a murder there.

26:55.666 --> 26:57.333
And it happened on April 12.

27:34.375 --> 27:37.000
SEE YOU IN THE LOCKER ROOM
IN THE GYM, IT'S IMPORTANT

27:51.000 --> 27:52.041
Sara?

27:59.875 --> 28:01.666
You thought you'd scored, huh?

28:02.125 --> 28:04.583
You made up that shit to fuck us over.

28:04.666 --> 28:06.375
I didn't make up anything.

28:06.458 --> 28:08.041
-You wrote it yourself!
-I didn't!

28:08.125 --> 28:10.250
We could get expelled
because of you, dickhead!

28:12.041 --> 28:13.166
Take off your clothes.

28:13.875 --> 28:16.458
Take off your clothes
or I'll beat your fucking head in!

28:18.291 --> 28:19.333
Strip!

28:54.583 --> 28:55.416
Smile. Listen to me.

29:01.500 --> 29:04.833
Fuck us over again,
and we'll post this photo online.

29:06.125 --> 29:06.958
Got it?

29:45.041 --> 29:46.500
Do you want to see the picture?

29:46.833 --> 29:48.291
How come you have a picture?

29:48.708 --> 29:49.666
Nico, what's up?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.416
He looks terrible.

29:53.791 --> 29:55.500
I've got a picture, guys.

29:56.041 --> 29:58.000
Let's see it. Why do you have it?

31:07.500 --> 31:10.041
JON ZÁRATE,
WINNER OF THE MATH OLYMPICS

31:10.125 --> 31:11.708
<i>Hello, this is Jon Zárate.</i>

31:11.791 --> 31:13.875
<i>Leave a message. Thanks.</i>

31:14.791 --> 31:17.375
<i>Mr. Zárate, this is Social Services.</i>

31:17.666 --> 31:21.333
<i>The renewal of your temporary leave</i>
<i>is up for revision.</i>

31:21.708 --> 31:24.041
<i>We need to do a complete check-up</i>

31:24.125 --> 31:25.250
<i>to reauthorize it.</i>

32:34.333 --> 32:35.166
Hello?

32:36.166 --> 32:37.416
Yes, I'm coming down.

33:23.916 --> 33:25.083
LOOK FOR A PATTERN

33:26.791 --> 33:28.166
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

33:28.416 --> 33:31.833
How old do you think the Russian is
from the 24-hour store?

33:32.291 --> 33:34.083
Forty... 42.

33:34.166 --> 33:35.250
Forty or 42?

33:37.666 --> 33:38.708
I don't know, 42.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.041
Forty.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.750
How long have they been now?

33:59.250 --> 34:01.666
David was taking me
to Paris this weekend.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.416
He left the computer on
and I saw the tickets.

34:06.583 --> 34:09.000
He's not good at keeping secrets.

34:10.666 --> 34:11.500
Right.

34:16.166 --> 34:17.625
He told you everything, huh?

34:19.750 --> 34:25.333
-Right after I got out of the hospital.
-Jon, those were six tough months.

34:26.541 --> 34:27.750
These things happen.

34:28.875 --> 34:32.541
I was in for a long time,
you two spent a lot of time together.

34:42.375 --> 34:43.791
-They've finished.
-And?

34:45.166 --> 34:46.958
The surgeon says it went well.

34:47.666 --> 34:49.750
We have to wait
and see how he progresses.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.458
-Let's grab something to eat.
-Yes.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.458
We've caught the man who did it.

35:07.791 --> 35:08.625
Aren't you happy?

35:09.666 --> 35:10.791
Yes, of course.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.291
Sure, but if he's a minor
and gets away with it...

35:13.375 --> 35:17.291
No, he's not a minor. That's for sure.
He's around 20.

35:19.208 --> 35:21.500
Twenty-one, he's 21.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.583
What I'm going to tell you
may sound strange, but listen, okay?

35:32.666 --> 35:34.833
I've been looking into some things.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.333
Look,

35:36.416 --> 35:39.333
the night David was shot,
there were five people:

35:39.666 --> 35:42.375
the owner, who is 53,
a 10-year-old boy,

35:42.458 --> 35:44.750
David, who is 32, the Russian, 42,

35:45.041 --> 35:48.583
and since we don't know
the assailant's age, a question mark.

35:49.833 --> 35:51.333
Right, on April 12, 1976,

35:51.416 --> 35:55.666
this same place was attacked.
There were also five people present:

35:55.750 --> 35:59.208
a general, 53, his escort, 21,
a 10-year-old boy,

35:59.291 --> 36:00.500
a terrorist, 42,

36:00.583 --> 36:04.375
and the other terrorist was 32 exactly.
Do you see the sequence?

36:08.375 --> 36:11.500
-That's insane.
-If you think that is, check this out.

36:14.125 --> 36:16.666
In 1955, in the same place,
there was another shooting.

36:16.750 --> 36:19.250
-Also on April 12.
-At the gas station?

36:19.458 --> 36:21.000
But in 1955, it was an inn.

36:21.083 --> 36:24.333
It was a crime of passion.
Apparently, the owner had a lover,

36:24.916 --> 36:27.541
and when she wanted to break up with him,
he went crazy

36:27.625 --> 36:31.208
and showed up with a shotgun.
At the time, the man was exactly 53,

36:31.291 --> 36:32.500
the woman, 42.

36:32.708 --> 36:34.833
A nephew who worked at the inn, 21.

36:34.916 --> 36:37.125
A customer having a glass
of wine there, 32.

36:37.208 --> 36:40.916
Who else was there?
The woman's son, who was, of course, 10

36:41.000 --> 36:44.375
That's why I say that David's killer
has to be exactly 21,

36:44.458 --> 36:47.416
because the numerical sequence is perfect.
Amazing! Jon, people don't die because of math.

36:50.541 --> 36:54.625
-This makes no sense.
-Yes, it does, Andrea. Here's the proof,

36:54.708 --> 36:58.458
numbers don't lie. Three times,
and every time a person dies. It's math!

36:58.541 --> 37:00.250
David's not dead, damn it!

37:06.333 --> 37:08.333
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

37:11.750 --> 37:12.583
It's true.

37:14.666 --> 37:15.916
It was a stupid idea.

37:17.875 --> 37:18.833
Jon,

37:18.916 --> 37:21.750
David was shot on April 2, not 12.

37:22.791 --> 37:23.625
That's true.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.250
Where'd you get that date from?

37:26.333 --> 37:27.833
You're saying I'm making it up?

37:27.916 --> 37:31.750
I'm not saying anything. You tell me.
April 12 is your birthday.

37:32.541 --> 37:33.375
And?

37:35.041 --> 37:37.500
-Have you stopped taking your meds?
-I can't take them.

37:37.583 --> 37:39.666
They make my head fuzzy
and I need to be lucid.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.166
But you can't stop taking your pills.

37:44.041 --> 37:45.375
Does your doctor know?

37:49.208 --> 37:50.625
I'm going to the bathroom.

39:30.291 --> 39:31.458
Twenty-one-fifty, please.

39:31.666 --> 39:35.666
I don't give a fuck about your family.
You're not going to any birthday!

39:35.750 --> 39:37.250
You know I was excited about it.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.458
-You're staying at home.
-Why?

39:39.541 --> 39:41.750
You're going home
to look after your kids!

39:41.833 --> 39:43.583
Please, not here.

39:43.666 --> 39:44.500
Please.

39:44.583 --> 39:47.250
You're not going anywhere
with your slutty cousin.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.041
Relax. I'll take care of it.

39:49.625 --> 39:53.125
-Sir, you have to leave the store.
-Don't touch me, fat-ass!

40:13.958 --> 40:15.333
-Sit down.
-No, thanks.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.791
We've spoken to the three boys
we think might've written the note.

40:24.708 --> 40:27.625
-They deny it all.
-What else would they say?

40:28.375 --> 40:30.500
We did a handwriting test on them

40:30.875 --> 40:33.458
and the writing on the note
doesn't match any of them.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.666
Look, see it for yourself.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.416
HANDWRITING EXPERT REPORT

40:46.125 --> 40:48.208
But someone had to write it, right?

40:48.458 --> 40:51.125
According to the test,
it's an adult's handwriting.

40:54.333 --> 40:58.125
Lucía, I don't want to pry,
but I think it's my duty to tell you.

40:58.916 --> 41:02.083
Maybe this matter is related
to your family situation.

41:03.125 --> 41:04.333
I don't understand.

41:04.416 --> 41:07.750
We know that your ex-husband
has a restraining order.

41:07.875 --> 41:12.500
We've dealt with this kind of thing before
and maybe Nico's father is involved.

41:13.666 --> 41:14.666
This is too much.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.000
Lucía, listen, please.

41:18.958 --> 41:22.250
The note mentions his birthday.
Maybe he wants to be with him.

41:22.875 --> 41:26.416
-I'm reporting this to the police.
-Lucía, please.

41:28.791 --> 41:32.000
I'm sorry if I offended you,
but we can't rule out the possibility.

41:32.541 --> 41:35.541
All you care about is your fucking record
and this fucking school.

41:35.750 --> 41:37.250
I care about my students.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.708
Then keep them away from him,
fucking do something!

41:41.708 --> 41:44.458
They won't touch your son again.
I assure you.

41:46.916 --> 41:49.583
You said that last time
and nothing's changed.

42:38.416 --> 42:40.291
--and the paper napkins.

42:40.750 --> 42:43.291
There you go. Here's your change.

42:44.916 --> 42:45.958
-Thanks.
-Bye.

42:57.583 --> 42:59.250
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

43:02.208 --> 43:05.291
I was here the other day with my son.
We bought a magazine.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.166
Someone slipped an envelope inside
with a threat,

43:08.250 --> 43:10.250
that if he comes here
on April 12, he'll die.

43:11.458 --> 43:13.208
Maybe it's not a threat.

43:15.583 --> 43:16.833
Maybe it's a warning.

43:18.208 --> 43:20.208
This is ridiculous. Did you do it?

43:21.625 --> 43:25.125
Look, there was a shooting here
years ago on April 12th.

43:25.208 --> 43:28.958
Don't let your son come here
on that day... end of story.

43:54.083 --> 43:54.916
EMPLOYEE, 32

43:55.000 --> 43:56.916
KILLER, 53

43:58.666 --> 44:01.458
<i>Hello, this is Jon Zárate.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

44:02.000 --> 44:02.833
<i>Thanks.</i>

44:04.166 --> 44:05.000
<i>Mr. Zárate,</i>

44:05.500 --> 44:09.083
<i>Dr. Ortiz insists</i>
<i>that you contact us immediately.</i>

44:09.166 --> 44:13.291
<i>The therapy is vital for controlling</i>
<i>the progress of the medication.</i>

44:13.375 --> 44:14.458
<i>Please, call us.</i>

44:15.291 --> 44:20.541
BLOODY INCIDENT AT HEAD OFFICE
OF CRÉDITO AGRÍCOLA BANK

44:42.125 --> 44:43.583
Don't blink, please.

44:46.041 --> 44:47.166
The left one.

44:50.958 --> 44:51.791
Good.

44:54.208 --> 44:55.541
Are you okay?

44:56.375 --> 44:58.333
Yes. I haven't slept much lately.

44:59.708 --> 45:02.625
You have eyestrain.
I'll prescribe some drops.

45:05.083 --> 45:07.416
I didn't come here about my eyes.

45:08.333 --> 45:09.583
Why, then?

45:11.541 --> 45:14.125
I wanted to know if you were
the son of Mercedes Vizcay,

45:15.333 --> 45:17.750
the woman who died
at the Los Molinos inn.

45:28.250 --> 45:30.583
I'm sorry, but I have patients waiting.

45:30.666 --> 45:33.166
You were 10 when it happened,
weren't you?

45:34.333 --> 45:35.833
Are you a journalist? No, I'm not a journalist.

45:37.833 --> 45:40.583
In that same spot, a few days ago,
a friend of mine was shot.

45:40.666 --> 45:42.083
I read about it in the papers.

45:43.125 --> 45:45.250
-I'm really sorry.
-Thanks a lot.

45:46.666 --> 45:49.375
Also, in that place,
there was an attack in 1976.

45:49.750 --> 45:52.833
And another murder in 1913,
I don't know if you knew that.

45:55.875 --> 45:59.125
-What do you want from me?
-Whatever, any information.

45:59.666 --> 46:02.375
I couldn't find out much
about what happened in 1913.

46:06.291 --> 46:07.666
That place is cursed.

46:09.625 --> 46:10.708
It was a massacre.

46:11.958 --> 46:13.500
Do you know what happened?

46:15.666 --> 46:17.416
Listen to me, leave it alone.

46:18.875 --> 46:20.000
Forget that place.

46:20.333 --> 46:21.375
I need to know.

46:21.875 --> 46:23.125
Please, I need this.

46:44.375 --> 46:45.666
Ask for Verónica,

46:46.583 --> 46:48.708
maybe she can give you more details.

46:52.708 --> 46:55.000
<i>Hi, this is Verónica.</i>
<i>I can't come to the phone.</i>

46:55.083 --> 46:57.000
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

47:00.291 --> 47:02.500
<i>Hello, this is Verónica.</i>
<i>I can't come...</i>

47:03.750 --> 47:05.625
Hey! You idiot!

47:07.375 --> 47:08.375
Asshole!

48:34.750 --> 48:35.666
Can I help you?

48:38.291 --> 48:40.708
Excuse me, are you looking for something?

48:50.541 --> 48:51.416
I know you.

48:55.291 --> 48:57.250
You were here the day of the shooting.

49:00.208 --> 49:02.791
What do you know about this place
before it was yours?

49:02.916 --> 49:05.333
Nothing, it was a gas station.
I bought it from a guy.

49:05.416 --> 49:06.541
That's a lie.

49:09.250 --> 49:12.333
Look, if you're not buying anything,
you'd better go.

49:24.750 --> 49:26.250
I don't want any trouble.

49:26.833 --> 49:28.625
Leave or I'll call the police.

49:51.750 --> 49:54.458
<i>Other species avoid these difficulties</i>

49:54.750 --> 49:57.541
<i>developing a totally different behavior.</i>

49:58.291 --> 50:00.000
<i>A couple is working here.</i>

50:00.083 --> 50:01.166
Leave me alone. What's wrong?

50:03.458 --> 50:04.583
You know very well.

50:05.291 --> 50:08.750
I had nothing to do with it.
How can you even think that?

50:10.541 --> 50:12.666
You're not the only one
who got the warning.

50:12.750 --> 50:14.208
<i>...into a large chamber</i>

50:14.291 --> 50:16.541
<i>which is more than a half-meter deep.</i>

50:17.666 --> 50:20.625
<i>Now, the priority is to stock up</i>

50:20.708 --> 50:24.250
<i>enough food, and to do it,</i>
<i>they don't have to go outside...</i>

50:24.333 --> 50:26.625
Martín Vallet received it, too.

50:27.666 --> 50:28.666
How do you know?

50:28.875 --> 50:30.541
Her mother told mine.

50:30.625 --> 50:33.166
<i>The silence of the subsoil is broken...</i>

50:33.250 --> 50:34.333
He got a note?

50:34.416 --> 50:36.875
No, the day Martín was born,

50:36.958 --> 50:39.958
a man showed up
at the hospital and warned them.

50:41.250 --> 50:42.375
What did he say to them?

50:42.458 --> 50:46.916
That if he went to the 24-hour store
the day he turned ten, he'd die.

50:48.750 --> 50:51.958
That's why they won't let him
leave the house that day.

51:28.916 --> 51:30.958
-Nothing's going to happen.
-How do you know?

51:31.041 --> 51:32.208
It'll be a wonderful day.

51:32.291 --> 51:34.000
You can't be sure of that.

51:34.083 --> 51:37.375
Honey, it's your birthday.
We'll go to the movies and get a burger.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.625
I don't want to go
to the 24-hour store.

51:42.041 --> 51:44.458
Nico, we'll go there together

51:44.541 --> 51:47.166
-and I'll buy you a present, okay?
-Are you crazy?

51:47.250 --> 51:49.166
I'm not going there on my birthday.

51:49.250 --> 51:52.208
You can't live in fear, honey.
It's the worst.

51:52.291 --> 51:54.125
I don't care, I'm not going there!

51:54.208 --> 51:55.875
-You'll go.
-You can't make me.

51:55.958 --> 51:58.583
I'm not, I'm going with you.
I'll be there with you.

51:58.666 --> 52:00.583
My dad wouldn't do this.

52:02.833 --> 52:05.375
-Any good father would do it.
-That's a lie.

52:07.125 --> 52:09.541
Another boy from school got the warning.

52:10.291 --> 52:13.500
And his parents won't let him
leave the house that day.

52:43.208 --> 52:45.750
OUR LADY OF PILAR
CARE HOME FOR THE ELDERLY

53:04.958 --> 53:06.583
<i>Jon, David's getting worse.</i>

53:06.666 --> 53:10.583
<i>The doctors fear the worst.</i>
<i>He's not responding to the treatment.</i>

53:10.666 --> 53:11.958
<i>Call me, please.</i>

53:16.666 --> 53:18.333
She's deaf in her right ear.

53:19.416 --> 53:22.083
Sometimes she confuses places and people.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.333
Otherwise, she's fine.

53:26.125 --> 53:26.958
There she is.

53:37.000 --> 53:37.916
Good afternoon.

53:38.666 --> 53:40.083
Thank you for seeing me.

53:46.666 --> 53:48.000
Do we know each other?

53:48.333 --> 53:51.541
No. I'm here on behalf of
your granddaughter, Verónica.

53:52.375 --> 53:55.875
She spoke very highly of you.
She said you're incredible...

53:57.041 --> 53:58.791
and have a great memory.

53:59.416 --> 54:02.625
She's a historian,
she loves old things like me.

54:03.583 --> 54:08.000
But... why did she send you
to this stopping place for mummies?

54:09.083 --> 54:12.250
She told me that you could tell me

54:12.333 --> 54:15.416
what happened at the branch
of Crédito Agrícola Bank.

54:17.541 --> 54:19.041
That was a long time ago.

54:20.958 --> 54:22.583
I was barely two years old.

54:24.333 --> 54:26.541
But you heard about what your father,

54:26.916 --> 54:28.291
Ezequiel González, did?

54:33.750 --> 54:34.583
What happened?

54:35.541 --> 54:37.083
What was your father like?

54:39.125 --> 54:41.083
My father was a desperate man.

54:43.250 --> 54:45.750
He'd spent a long time in the African war.

54:47.375 --> 54:50.708
He suffered...
from all kinds of diseases there.

54:52.291 --> 54:53.500
When he came back...

54:54.250 --> 54:57.958
he infected me with one of those...
African viruses.

54:58.916 --> 55:00.000
I was dying.

55:00.958 --> 55:03.750
And my father had no money
for the treatment,

55:03.833 --> 55:07.333
so he went to that bank
and begged the manager...

55:08.791 --> 55:10.125
to give him a loan.

55:12.666 --> 55:16.333
But since we were poor
and had no property...

55:17.916 --> 55:19.125
the manager refused.

55:20.833 --> 55:24.041
My father was so desperate
watching his daughter die...

55:25.583 --> 55:27.583
that he decided to rob that bank.

55:29.375 --> 55:30.875
But something went wrong.

55:33.750 --> 55:35.083
It all went wrong.

55:41.125 --> 55:42.875
The bank manager had a gun

55:43.791 --> 55:45.583
and tried to stop the robbery.

55:49.791 --> 55:52.000
The other people started screaming...

55:53.583 --> 55:56.750
and he acted as if he was in the war.

55:57.416 --> 55:58.416
He went crazy...

55:59.250 --> 56:00.500
and started shooting.

56:06.291 --> 56:08.166
He killed four people.

56:12.958 --> 56:14.500
Then he committed suicide.

56:16.583 --> 56:18.166
He committed suicide?

56:25.166 --> 56:29.708
Who could live with the death
of four innocent people on his conscience?

56:35.208 --> 56:36.833
I won't bother you anymore.

56:41.208 --> 56:42.708
Thank you for everything.

56:44.041 --> 56:45.333
Are you sure...

56:46.625 --> 56:48.166
we don't know each other?

56:53.708 --> 56:54.541
No.

56:56.708 --> 56:57.750
Thank you.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.291
April 12, 1913.

57:18.833 --> 57:20.916
April 12, 1955.

57:23.833 --> 57:25.666
April 12, 1976.

57:27.125 --> 57:28.333
Always April 12.

57:32.291 --> 57:33.625
APRIL 2, 2008

57:35.083 --> 57:36.125
No, not always.

57:38.541 --> 57:39.666
Not always.

59:19.125 --> 59:20.916
No, but he's still alive.

59:21.708 --> 59:23.416
He's alive physically,

59:23.500 --> 59:26.625
but the latest tests indicate
that he's in phase four,

59:26.708 --> 59:27.791
an advanced phase.

59:28.750 --> 59:30.583
There's no hope of recovery.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.125
I'm very sorry.

59:33.583 --> 59:35.291
Is there nothing that can be done?

59:36.916 --> 59:38.000
Unfortunately, no.

59:38.333 --> 59:41.541
I think the most humane thing
would be to turn off life support

59:41.625 --> 59:43.666
-and let him go in peace.
-But...

59:44.541 --> 59:47.375
some people have woken up.
There have been cases.

59:47.458 --> 59:51.125
-The probability is one in a million.
-That means there's hope.

59:51.583 --> 59:53.875
David could be that one in a million.

59:55.833 --> 59:57.000
Let's go.

59:57.708 --> 59:58.541
It's over.

59:59.750 --> 01:00:02.125
No. We can't let him die,

01:00:02.208 --> 01:00:03.416
please.

01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:22.750
<i>Hello, this is Jon Zárate.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:24.083
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:27.000
Jon, they want to unplug him.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:30.000
I need you to help me. Come here or...

01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:32.083
call me back or something.

01:00:54.625 --> 01:00:59.458
BOY
10 YEARS OLD

01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:06.666
Go!

01:01:07.916 --> 01:01:08.750
Go!

01:01:10.916 --> 01:01:12.750
The one with the whistle out.

01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:19.541
The ref's a slacker.

01:01:22.833 --> 01:01:24.083
-Excuse me.
-Hello.

01:01:24.166 --> 01:01:25.875
-Martín Vallet's father?
-Yes.

01:01:25.958 --> 01:01:28.416
I'm Lucía, the mother
of Nicolás, a classmate.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.750
Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:32.666
-What, did they fight?
-No. It's not that.

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:35.708
Is Martín not going to class on Tuesday?

01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:37.416
Yes. Why?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.416
My son received a note, a sort of warning

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.000
or threat...

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.708
-And you think it was Martín?
-No.

01:01:43.791 --> 01:01:46.708
But he told me that you also got one

01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:49.625
in the hospital,
when your wife was giving birth.

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:51.625
I don't know what you're saying.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:55.041
Martín's not going on Tuesday
because he's seeing the doctor.

01:01:55.791 --> 01:01:56.625
Of course.

01:01:57.875 --> 01:01:58.958
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:00.833
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:02:13.166 --> 01:02:15.958
What did he say?
He's not going to class, is he?

01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:18.041
Because he has to see the doctor.

01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:19.208
Yeah, right.

01:02:19.291 --> 01:02:20.958
Stop it! Okay?

01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:26.166
I don't want to hear
another word about this.

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:28.041
Got it?

01:02:29.916 --> 01:02:31.250
Fasten your seat belt.

01:03:06.208 --> 01:03:08.333
-I've been calling you.
-I lost my cell phone.

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:10.833
Sorry, it's a disaster here. How's David?

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:15.458
They're unplugging him tomorrow.
Pablo and his mother have decided it.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:18.083
Jon, I need you to talk to them.

01:03:18.166 --> 01:03:20.958
-Tell them he's still alive.
-They're unplugging him tomorrow?

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:23.291
Tomorrow is 12.

01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:25.916
Now it makes sense.

01:03:27.791 --> 01:03:28.625
What does?

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:36.041
It's always on the 12,

01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:37.208
do you understand?

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:41.041
April 12, Ezequiel killed four people,
then committed suicide.

01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:46.500
Exactly 42 years later,
a woman aged 42 dies.

01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:51.666
Twenty-one years later,
a man, aged 21, dies. And 32 years later,
a man, aged 32, will die.

01:04:00.208 --> 01:04:02.875
You see?
The pattern has repeated four times.

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:05.875
Every time one dies, the next one is born.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:09.333
It only needs to repeat once more
for the circle to close.

01:04:11.375 --> 01:04:14.000
So, in ten years,
a 10-year-old boy will die.

01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:17.833
Do you hear yourself?

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:20.166
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.

01:04:20.583 --> 01:04:23.416
You're saying that these
are all the same people,

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.625
that every time one dies,
the next one is born,

01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:29.708
that this Ezequiel, or whatever,
reincarnates again and again.

01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:31.166
It's a numerical sequence.

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:34.208
You're saying that David
and this killer are the same person!

01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:36.708
Andrea, are you listening to me or not?

01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:40.666
David is going to die.
When he does, a boy will be born.

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:43.000
In ten years, that boy will be shot.

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:45.750
But now that we know it, we can stop it. I know you feel guilty
about what happened.

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:51.500
It had to happen.
David and I had to be there that night.

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:54.000
You went there because I asked you to!

01:04:54.083 --> 01:04:56.125
David had to go there
for the circle to close.

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:58.625
No, you had to go
into that fucking 24-hour store!

01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:01.625
I asked you to get the ice!

01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:05.125
Don't you see that you're the one
who should be dying?

01:05:06.458 --> 01:05:09.416
Maybe, but I'm the one
here talking to you.

01:05:26.333 --> 01:05:29.375
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:05:29.916 --> 01:05:32.625
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:36.041
<i>Happy birthday, dear Nico</i>

01:05:36.625 --> 01:05:39.333
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:05:39.416 --> 01:05:40.250
Make a wish.

01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:47.458
Great!

01:05:49.416 --> 01:05:50.750
Happy birthday, honey.

01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:05.541
Thanks a lot, Mom.

01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:07.041
You're welcome, sweetie.

01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:13.333
Go on, get changed, or you'll be late.

01:06:36.541 --> 01:06:39.833
<i>Jon, they're going</i>
<i>to unplug him this afternoon</i>

01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:43.333
<i>and I'd like you to be here with me.</i>

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:45.625
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:47.583
<i>Big kiss.</i>

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.500
APPROVAL FORM FOR
CEASING LIFE SUPPORT TREATMENT

01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:35.458
Your mother's going to make you go?

01:08:01.208 --> 01:08:03.708
David was going to ask you
to marry him in Paris.

01:08:08.791 --> 01:08:10.750
I kept it in case he recovered.

01:08:11.875 --> 01:08:12.708
Thank you.

01:08:58.582 --> 01:08:59.457
I do.

01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:39.500
I couldn't save you in this life...

01:09:40.457 --> 01:09:41.832
but I will in the next.

01:10:03.916 --> 01:10:06.416
-The maternity ward?
-Behind that door.

01:10:16.375 --> 01:10:17.958
MATERNITY

01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:24.958
The mother is very happy.

01:10:32.666 --> 01:10:35.208
Hey, you're not allowed in here, okay?

01:10:35.291 --> 01:10:37.791
Listen to me. It's very important,
or your son will die.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.916
Listen to me, whatever happens,

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.416
don't let your son
go to the 24-hour store

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.708
on April 12, 2018.

01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:46.875
-What are you saying?
-Twenty-four-hour store, April 12, 2018.

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:49.250
-Let go of me.
-Fontana street, 24-hour store.

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.208
-Let go of me!
-I just want to help!

01:10:51.291 --> 01:10:54.583
-Let go of me or his son will die!
-Get out of here!

01:10:54.666 --> 01:10:57.791
I just wanted to help! Please!

01:10:58.208 --> 01:10:59.583
I just wanted to help!

01:11:00.375 --> 01:11:01.333
Hey!

01:11:01.916 --> 01:11:02.791
Let go!

01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:04.958
You have to listen to me!

01:11:05.291 --> 01:11:06.583
Please!

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:16.166
How are you, honey?

01:11:19.166 --> 01:11:20.125
Go to the car.

01:12:00.041 --> 01:12:01.166
He's not in school.

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:04.083
We've looked everywhere.

01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:07.291
He couldn't have gone
without being seen.

01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:09.166
Could he have gone home alone?

01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:12.000
No, it's his birthday.

01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:15.166
He knew I was picking him up,
I told him to wait.

01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:17.500
Take it easy, we'll find him, okay?

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:21.416
We'll search the school, call his friends
and do whatever it takes to find him.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:22.666
-Keep calm.
-Thanks.

01:12:23.291 --> 01:12:24.166
Excuse me.

01:12:25.833 --> 01:12:27.458
-Hello, good afternoon.
-Hi.

01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:29.333
A boy has disappeared.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.375
What's wrong with you?

01:12:51.916 --> 01:12:54.125
Unless you tell me, I can't help you.

01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:59.833
Have you taken any drug or medication?

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:09.125
I need my pills.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:12.000
Good, what pills do you take?

01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:13.125
In my pocket.

01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:22.083
I just wanted to warn them,
their child is in danger.

01:13:22.166 --> 01:13:23.833
These are pills for schizophrenia.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.833
You have to believe me. April 12, 2018.

01:13:27.375 --> 01:13:28.666
It's going to happen again.

01:13:29.541 --> 01:13:31.083
I'll give you an injection.

01:14:07.416 --> 01:14:08.500
Are you all right?

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:10.208
Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:31.291
Poor woman's scared to death.

01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:32.625
I'm sure Nico's fine.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.083
Let's go, you'll be late for Music.

01:14:40.708 --> 01:14:42.208
What were you thinking, Sara?

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:47.958
Do you know how scared I was?
And the embarrassment?

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.083
I'm sorry.

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:50.791
It was my fault.

01:14:51.791 --> 01:14:52.708
It was my idea.

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:54.583
I'm so sorry. Let's go.

01:15:16.458 --> 01:15:17.458
He's still alive? Yes.

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:22.416
He doesn't want to go.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:44.291
ANDREA CALLING

01:16:04.958 --> 01:16:06.041
Mom, please...

01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:27.000
-Javi, I have to pee.
-Okay, hurry up.

01:16:41.416 --> 01:16:42.333
Get out.

01:16:42.416 --> 01:16:43.375
I'm not going in.

01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:45.125
Get out right now! I'm sick of this!

01:16:47.083 --> 01:16:48.375
Listen to me, son,

01:16:48.458 --> 01:16:49.958
I was once like you.

01:16:50.208 --> 01:16:53.541
I thought if I hid my head
and looked away, it'd all go away.

01:16:54.208 --> 01:16:55.583
But it never goes away.

01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:56.750
It got worse.

01:16:57.333 --> 01:17:00.250
The fear never left me,
not even when I was alone.

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:03.416
Until one day, I decided
to put an end to it

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:05.250
and face the situation.

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:07.000
Then it was all over.

01:17:07.625 --> 01:17:10.583
Do you see
why you have to go in there now?

01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:12.750
Look. Here.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.791
Get a shake and the latest issue
of that magazine you like, okay?

01:17:20.041 --> 01:17:23.541
When you come out, I promise
we'll never mention this again.

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:25.083
Okay, honey?

01:17:27.166 --> 01:17:28.166
Go on.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:03.916
-Andrea, I can't talk right now.
<i>-Jon, no, wait.</i>

01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:06.583
David is one in a million.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:08.916
What?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.958
<i>He's alive. He's very weak,</i>

01:18:11.041 --> 01:18:14.208
but he's alive.
It's like he resurrected, it's a miracle.

01:18:15.083 --> 01:18:17.500
Do you hear me? You have to come.

01:18:19.916 --> 01:18:21.250
Then you were right.

01:18:22.291 --> 01:18:23.125
<i>What?</i>

01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:25.833
I was the one who had to die.

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:29.333
<i>No. No one's going to die.</i>

01:18:30.041 --> 01:18:31.333
I have to go, Andrea.

01:18:31.416 --> 01:18:34.083
<i>Jon, no, wait a moment.</i>

01:18:34.166 --> 01:18:35.416
I love you very much.

01:20:01.416 --> 01:20:03.958

01:20:40.625 --> 01:20:42.666
That guy's going to rob the store.

01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:47.250
I told you I didn't want
to see you here again.

01:20:47.333 --> 01:20:49.958
-It's going to happen again.
-Get out of here.

01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:53.250
What's this?

01:20:53.333 --> 01:20:56.166
It's for a boy, in ten years' time.
You need to warn him.

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:59.000
-Get out or I'll call the police.
-Fucking listen to me!

01:20:59.083 --> 01:21:01.291
It'll be on April 12, in ten years.

The boy will remind you of me.

01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:07.291
Get the fuck out of here! It's going to happen now.

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:28.416
Where's the older man?

01:21:28.875 --> 01:21:30.333
He took the day off.

01:21:41.458 --> 01:21:42.875
It's going to be now.

01:21:50.708 --> 01:21:51.791
No, don't shoot!

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:53.041
Relax, man. Relax.

01:21:57.291 --> 01:21:58.416
Take out your gun. I don't have a gun.

01:22:03.208 --> 01:22:05.375
Outside! Everyone outside!

01:22:06.125 --> 01:22:06.958
Outside!

01:22:40.791 --> 01:22:41.833
Outside!

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:43.875
Outside!

01:22:46.541 --> 01:22:47.375
Outside!

01:22:47.833 --> 01:22:49.541
To the ground! On your knees!

01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:54.333
-Anyone else inside?
-No.

01:22:55.083 --> 01:22:57.958
-Are you sure? In the bathroom?
-There's no one else!

01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:00.208
This doesn't fit.

01:23:08.041 --> 01:23:09.125
Here's the police.

01:23:09.416 --> 01:23:11.833
Drop the gun
before something bad happens.

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:26.208
Drop the gun!

01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:44.541
Give me the money.

01:24:44.791 --> 01:24:46.250
Fuck that! Drop the gun!

01:24:52.041 --> 01:24:54.125
Last time! Drop the gun!

01:24:54.625 --> 01:24:56.375
Go! Run!

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:58.041
Drop the fucking gun!

01:24:58.125 --> 01:24:59.875
Take the fucking money out!

01:25:03.083 --> 01:25:04.583
Run!

01:25:08.041 --> 01:25:10.291
Nico!

01:25:10.875 --> 01:25:12.250
Run!

01:25:38.083 --> 01:25:40.333
Are you okay? Are you okay?

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:41.541
Are you okay?

01:25:51.208 --> 01:25:53.458
Mom, I wasn't scared.

01:25:54.791 --> 01:25:55.625
I swear.

01:25:57.541 --> 01:25:58.500
I wasn't scared.

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:52.000
Jon!

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:00.416
Is he okay?

01:27:01.333 --> 01:27:02.250
Is everything okay?

01:27:16.333 --> 01:27:17.708
Jon! Jon!

01:27:31.666 --> 01:27:32.791
No, no!

01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:34.583
No, Jon! No, no, no!
