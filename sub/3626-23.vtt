the police, right?

any of your business

investment was also fake.

You can go now.

my college money with him.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.769
'Look at that.'

08:28.856 --> 08:30.553
I'm so glad that
everybody's here.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.515
We need to get this
crazy girl out of here.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.081
- Chuck, what is she doing here?
- I'll-I'll do it.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.083
Are you trying
to have me killed, Bass?

08:39.170 --> 08:40.955
- Fine.
- Shh. Shut up.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.131
Oh my God,
I am going to scream..

08:43.218 --> 08:45.133
So is this how you found out
about that night at Butter?

08:45.220 --> 08:46.569
You bring Georgina here?

08:46.656 --> 08:48.310
Hey, does anybody
know a Gabriel?

08:48.397 --> 08:49.529
[cell ringing]

08:50.225 --> 08:51.705
Gabriel, hey.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.097
Thank you for
calling me back.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.278
[indistinct conversations]

09:02.193 --> 09:03.455
Hi.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.544
Hi.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.199
You okay?

09:08.286 --> 09:09.897
Not really.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.072
It's probably the wrong
thing to say

09:11.159 --> 09:12.943
but I'm happy to see ya.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.903
You sounded really scared
when you called me this morning.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.166
Then you didn't show up.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.820
I thought maybe you were having
second thoughts about me.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.692
No, not at all.

09:22.779 --> 09:25.869
Just...really confused.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.959
Yeah, me too. I-I thought
we were being careful.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.440
Well, I wasn't careful
enough, it seems.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.836
I'm not pregnant.

09:35.923 --> 09:38.316
Just naive.

09:38.403 --> 09:41.537
I can't believe...
I believed you.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.236
Don't worry.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.238
You're safe, for now.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.763
I-I wanted to give you
the opportunity to fix things

09:49.850 --> 09:53.462
to prove you're not
who you probably are.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.595
Listen, you have to know
how sorry I am.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.989
I don't know what you are right
now except a liar and a thief

09:59.076 --> 10:01.775
but you can change one of those
by giving the money back.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.215
I can't do that.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.263
Gabriel, why?

10:12.350 --> 10:15.484
If you're just using me,
why-why come back?

10:15.571 --> 10:18.226
Why-why act like
you care about me now?

10:18.313 --> 10:21.446
You're not leaving my hotel
until you repay your investors.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.448
'It's your choice.'

10:23.535 --> 10:25.668
'Either you hand over the money'

10:25.755 --> 10:27.409
or we hand you over
to the feds.

10:30.717 --> 10:31.805
You have to believe me.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.329
I would if I could

10:34.416 --> 10:36.026
b-but I don't have the money.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.075
Poppy Lifton does.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.476
Oh, Daniel.
You just missed everyone.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.261
Jenny said something about
going to an exhibit

10:53.348 --> 10:54.958
at the fashion institute.

10:55.045 --> 10:58.527
And your father pulled Eric out,
all very mysterious.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.224
You alright?

11:00.311 --> 11:01.399
Uh, no.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.793
No. I mean, yeah.
No, I'm not.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.969
Well, there's clearly
something on your mind.

11:06.056 --> 11:08.668
Well, Serena asked me
not to say anything.

11:08.755 --> 11:12.628
Oh, that's my least favorite
sentence. Start talking.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.499
I think she's wrong
not to say anything.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.806
I-I-she doesn't know
how serious this is.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.503
Or if she does, I mean,
she thinks she can handle it

11:18.590 --> 11:20.549
and she really can't.

11:20.636 --> 11:21.985
Well, I'm sure
if it's important

11:22.072 --> 11:23.726
she'll forgive you
for breaking her trust.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.075
Yeah.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.470
I..

11:28.557 --> 11:30.559
Gabriel is a con artist.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.648
His-his investment
was a scam.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.563
He took all the money for
himself, including my dad's.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.783
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.567
Uh, Serena thinks
she can somehow

11:38.654 --> 11:40.134
sweet-talk him into giving
everything back

11:40.221 --> 11:43.485
but I mean, really, I don't
think that Blair and Chuck

11:43.572 --> 11:44.616
can just scheme
their way out of this one.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.488
I thought about calling
the cops

11:46.575 --> 11:48.403
but there's-there's
no proof.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.361
No. No, no. You did the right
thing by telling me.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.146
The last thing we need
is the authorities

11:52.233 --> 11:53.756
to implicate Serena
in all of this.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.062
Yeah, I don't want
that either.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.454
But how do I tell my dad
that he got conned

11:56.541 --> 11:57.934
out of all my
college money?

11:58.021 --> 12:00.371
You don't,
and you don't need to worry.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.764
I'll take care of it.

12:01.851 --> 12:04.462
Honestly, I was kinda
hoping you'd say that.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.551
Just do me a favor and
don't say anything to anyone.

12:06.638 --> 12:07.857
We don't need to make this

12:07.944 --> 12:10.120
any more complicated
than it already is.

12:10.207 --> 12:13.733
Yeah, I just want you to do
what you people do.

12:13.820 --> 12:14.864
Get my dad's money back.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.173
Thank you.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.349
Poppy's got the rich friends
who invite her to parties.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.133
The designers who give her
expensive clothes

12:23.220 --> 12:25.309
to wear for photographs.

12:25.396 --> 12:28.269
And exes who've given her
some awfully nice presents.

12:28.356 --> 12:31.925
In other words,
she's a fauxcialite.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.665
I met her at
a Mercedes launch party.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.407
The fauxcialite ball.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.235
I tried enticing her
into investing

12:38.322 --> 12:40.847
in communication satellites
for third world countries.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.500
'She tried enticing me
into making her'

12:42.587 --> 12:44.807
the next Mrs. Edwards.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.243
'It turns out
I was awfully good'

12:46.330 --> 12:47.767
at getting folks
to give me their money.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.292
I just wasn't so good
at investing it.

12:51.379 --> 12:55.122
Hence, no Wi-Fi for
the poor African children.

12:55.209 --> 12:58.125
You know, I had to give
my investors something

12:58.212 --> 13:00.257
so I brought on new investors
to pay off the old investors.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.824
And then those investors--

13:01.911 --> 13:03.608
We know the rest.
It's called a Ponzi scheme.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.482
Serena, I swear to you

13:07.569 --> 13:09.179
in the beginning,
you were just a mark.

13:09.266 --> 13:12.008
And your mom,
Bart Bass' widow

13:12.095 --> 13:14.271
'was gonna be our big score.'

13:14.358 --> 13:15.446
[sighs]

13:15.533 --> 13:17.187
Then my..

13:17.274 --> 13:20.582
Then my feelings for you
got in the way of that.

13:20.669 --> 13:24.281
So how did Poppy end up
with all the money?

13:24.368 --> 13:26.457
It was always
business for us.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.895
As soon as we realized that
we were both just playing rich

13:28.982 --> 13:30.157
'I shared my plans with her'

13:30.244 --> 13:32.812
and she shared
her society connections.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.031
When we hit our number,
I was gonna disappear

13:35.118 --> 13:36.816
and she was gonna stay behind

13:36.903 --> 13:40.863
and just be another rich society
gal that I took advantage of.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.214
Then you called me
this morning.

13:46.477 --> 13:47.696
She thought you made me.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.176
Smart girl.

13:49.263 --> 13:52.048
Yeah. She said
we had to end it now.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.834
She offered to buy me out
so I could leave.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.748
She emptied the bank account
and never showed up.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.446
Instead, she went
to your hotel room

13:58.533 --> 14:00.622
and blamed the entire
thing on you.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.930
And I should've
just left town.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.627
But I couldn't go
without seeing you again.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.457
I'm afraid the only
chance you have

14:09.544 --> 14:12.199
of getting your money back..

14:12.286 --> 14:13.461
...is finding Poppy Lifton.

14:16.029 --> 14:18.770
This is taking too long.
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.903
Wait. No, don't leave me
alone with her.

14:20.990 --> 14:21.948
Well,
come and talk with me.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.864
Oh, or stay with me
and talk.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.214
Look, Blair, everyone else
has forgiven me.

14:27.301 --> 14:28.519
I'm just waiting on you.

14:28.606 --> 14:30.347
Everyone who?

14:30.434 --> 14:32.828
And besides, some things
are unforgivable.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.830
[inhales deeply]
God will help me find a way

14:34.917 --> 14:36.310
'to earn your forgiveness.'

14:38.790 --> 14:41.706
Oh, looks like he answers
my prayers faster than yours.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.447
'Chuck, what happened?'

14:43.534 --> 14:44.927
We've got the wrong guy.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.408
Believe it or not,
the puppeteer is Poppy.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.845
Poppy?

14:49.932 --> 14:52.152
Thank you
for actually coming.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.762
Nobody believed
that you really would.

14:55.155 --> 14:57.200
As much as you don't
believe me

14:57.287 --> 14:58.549
you're the only girl

14:58.636 --> 15:00.073
who was ever worth waking
a priest up for.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.337
I really did fall for you.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.817
Well, not enough, it seems.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.908
The money was
more important.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.083
Listen, Serena--

15:10.170 --> 15:12.259
Gabriel, you should go.

15:20.528 --> 15:21.790
Where's he going?

15:21.877 --> 15:23.400
My PI hasn't confirmed
his story yet.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.228
And even if it is true,
he's still a crook.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.708
He's not the one we need.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.318
And besides, if we
really need to find him

15:28.405 --> 15:29.841
I don't think
it'll be that hard.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.366
But why would Poppy stay in town
after what she did?

15:32.453 --> 15:34.455
Well, she has to if
she's gonna play the victim.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.936
She-she wants us to think
Gabriel fooled her, too.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.894
[Chuck]
'She wants money.'

15:38.981 --> 15:40.722
All we need to provide
is some sap

15:40.809 --> 15:42.202
she thinks
she can get it from.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.291
Except she knows all of us.

15:44.378 --> 15:45.857
She doesn't know all of us.

15:48.425 --> 15:50.166
What?

15:50.253 --> 15:51.733
No. Uh-uh.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.343
Lying is also a sin.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.563
I will not perjure myself
in front of the Lord.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.347
We'll see about that.

15:57.434 --> 16:00.002
Looks like Georgina's
losing her religion.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.962
Or has B met her match
in the battle for G's soul?

16:06.661 --> 16:08.837
Here are the names
and amounts

16:08.924 --> 16:10.839
of the residents who
invested with Mr. Edwards

16:10.926 --> 16:12.101
if that's his real name.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.407
Oh, I'm sorry, Bruce.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.323
I know this goes beyond
your usual duties.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.760
Bass business
usually does.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.328
Hey. You keep calling.
Is everything okay?

16:21.415 --> 16:22.982
Will you excuse us
just a moment?

16:27.682 --> 16:29.684
I know all about
Gabriel's scheme.

16:29.771 --> 16:33.296
And frankly, I'm disappointed
that you did not come to me.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.384
Dan?

16:36.169 --> 16:39.737
I'm-I'm sorry, mom.
I was gonna tell you and then..

16:39.824 --> 16:41.957
[scoffs]
I can't believe
he told you.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.873
Well, he obviously sees
the situation and my role in it

16:44.960 --> 16:47.267
much more clearly
than you do.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.791
Well, it is a mess,
but-but it's-it's my mess

16:49.878 --> 16:50.922
and I'm gonna fix it.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.359
You will do no such thing.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.144
This goes far beyond
bad taste in boyfriends.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.841
But even you encouraged me
to be with him.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.800
If word gets out about this

16:58.887 --> 17:00.845
all anyone will ever think

17:00.932 --> 17:02.630
when they hear the name
Serena van der Woodsen

17:02.717 --> 17:05.241
is how you helped scam
your friends and family

17:05.328 --> 17:07.287
out of hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.289
I know. I know,
and I feel terrible.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.335
That's why I'm gonna get
everything back. I have a plan.

17:12.422 --> 17:15.121
Ah, well, don't be naive.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.036
The Madoff people
will be in court for years

17:17.123 --> 17:18.472
and never see a dime.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.909
The only plan is for me
to quietly tell everyone

17:20.996 --> 17:23.172
that the deal didn't work out
and pay them back myself.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.392
- But what about Poppy?
- What about her?

17:25.479 --> 17:28.308
She was behind all of this.
She can't just get away with it.

17:28.395 --> 17:29.787
Yes, she can.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.311
And especially if it means
that your name

17:31.398 --> 17:32.573
stays out of it.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.750
This is an adult scandal.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.535
And the adult thing to do is
for me to pay everyone back

17:38.622 --> 17:41.756
and for you to do
absolutely nothing.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.366
Now let it go.

17:43.453 --> 17:44.846
Am I understood?

17:46.587 --> 17:47.805
Yeah.

17:51.244 --> 17:52.767
[Lily]
'Okay, Bruce.'

17:55.857 --> 17:57.380
Where were we here?

17:57.467 --> 17:59.817
Well, we've been over all
the investors, except Rufus.

17:59.904 --> 18:03.778
Well, how about
we handle his payout..

18:03.865 --> 18:05.606
...a little differently?

18:07.477 --> 18:09.436
Uh-oh. You don't really
seem all that excited.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.090
No, the ring is amazing.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.743
And I-I think it's great
you want to marry my mom.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.832
I just want to make sure
you're prepared.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.356
Well,
I havedone this before.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.227
So has she, four times.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.663
Yeah, those guys
weren't right for her.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.056
That's definitely true.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.276
But my mom can be
a little crazy too.

18:23.363 --> 18:26.366
And I-I love her.
I, uh, I just..

18:26.453 --> 18:28.672
I just don't want you
to forget where she came from.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.065
Trust me.
I know the family.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.328
And your mother is nothing
like her mother.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.156
And I'm totally up
for the wild ride

18:34.243 --> 18:37.290
that is Lily Rhodes
van der Woodsen Bass et cetera.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.641
Well, welcome
to the family then.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.599
So have you thought about
how you're gonna propose?

18:42.686 --> 18:44.253
I mean, Klaus with a K
did it with a blimp.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.037
C-Claus did it
on-on top of a pyramid.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.517
Although she didn't
say yes to that.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.824
But, uh, you have
the bar set pretty high.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.914
Sure. Uh, but, um..

18:53.001 --> 18:55.134
Yeah, yeah.
I have lots of ideas.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.092
Come on, G.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.834
Don't you miss Dior?
Prada?

18:59.921 --> 19:02.097
Looking fabulous?

19:02.184 --> 19:03.881
I mean, for you?

19:03.968 --> 19:06.014
Jesus loves me as I am.

19:06.101 --> 19:07.320
[scoffs]

19:07.407 --> 19:11.802
He would love you more
with some styling.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.587
Think of the fun
you used to have

19:13.674 --> 19:15.719
pretending to be
Sarah and Svetlana.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.547
Slipping people roofies

19:17.634 --> 19:21.421
outing them to their
unsuspecting parents at dinner.

19:21.508 --> 19:24.728
Those things don't call
to me anymore, Blair.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.035
Look, I made a choice.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.428
I let go of the evil

19:28.515 --> 19:31.866
so I can find love
and happiness with the good.

19:31.953 --> 19:35.348
I know it sounds dull,
but it's quite nurturing.

19:35.435 --> 19:36.827
Can't you understand?

19:36.914 --> 19:38.873
More than you know.

19:41.354 --> 19:44.618
I gave up my old ways when
I let Jesus take the wheel.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.838
That is a Carrie Underwood song,
not a life choice.

19:47.925 --> 19:51.277
I'm sorry
but I can't help you

19:51.364 --> 19:52.843
if it goes
against my beliefs.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.933
But..

19:56.020 --> 19:57.631
...when you look at it

19:57.718 --> 20:00.286
Jesus drove you here.
Right?

20:00.373 --> 20:01.809
Actually, I believe
his name was Jesus.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.114
Not in the cab.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.116
In your country-western
way of life.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.685
You said God would help you find
a way to earn my forgiveness.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.384
And here it is.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.951
So my amends would be
to entrap Poppy Lifton

20:14.038 --> 20:16.302
get the money back
that she stole

20:16.389 --> 20:18.217
and destroy her
in the process?

20:18.304 --> 20:20.958
Exactly. If you cut revenge
out of the bible

20:21.045 --> 20:23.352
there's not even enough pages
to make a pamphlet.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.965
"And they shall know
I am the Lord

20:28.052 --> 20:30.838
when I shall lay my
vengeance on them."

20:30.925 --> 20:33.841
How'd you know
my favorite passage?

20:33.928 --> 20:36.365
[cell phone ringing]

20:36.452 --> 20:37.758
Hey, S.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.890
My mom wants us
to call off the plan.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.457
What? No.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.894
Do you know how much
work this exorcism was?

20:43.981 --> 20:46.506
It's gonna take days for Dorota
to re-organize my closet.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.856
I don't like it either.
I'm just telling you.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.379
She wants to take care
of things herself.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.076
And she wants us
to leave Poppy out of it.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.122
Poppy isit.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.124
She's so evil she makes
the old Georgina

20:56.211 --> 20:57.560
look like the new Georgina.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.083
[Lily]
'Serena?'

20:59.170 --> 21:01.651
I-I have to go.
Just put the plan on hold.

21:01.738 --> 21:04.437
And do not do anything
until I call you back, okay?

21:04.524 --> 21:06.743
- S, wait!
- I mean it, Blair.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.708
[Lily]
'Yes, well,
the cookies came from..'

21:18.320 --> 21:21.367
Oh, Poppy came by
to see how we were doing

21:21.454 --> 21:23.717
after all the terrible
drama this morning.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.153
[Poppy]
'I mean, the money
part was bad'

21:25.240 --> 21:27.460
but I just felt like
such an idiot.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.852
I thought he loved me.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.507
Obviously you understand that.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.379
Obviously.

21:33.466 --> 21:36.382
Poppy also told me that she's
going to Miami tomorrow night.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.427
Yeah, I have
a cousin down there

21:38.514 --> 21:41.300
and I just thought,
if I have to feel like a fool

21:41.387 --> 21:42.910
I might as well do it
with a tan.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.391
[laughing]

21:45.478 --> 21:47.088
[chuckles]
Oh, uh, you might wanna check.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.698
- I think you have a little..
- Oh, oh. Excuse me.

21:48.785 --> 21:49.917
Yes.

21:55.662 --> 21:58.142
What are you doing having tea
and smiling at her?

21:58.229 --> 21:59.840
We should lock the doors
and call the police.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.363
We already discussed it.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.366
The adult thing to do is
to let it and her disappear.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.716
She's not disappearing
she's going to Miami

22:06.803 --> 22:09.197
where she's gonna do the exact
same thing to new people.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.417
Well, we can only hope
that those people

22:11.504 --> 22:12.940
will be smarter
than we were.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.205
Sorry, my dad's not home.
Can I take a message?

22:17.292 --> 22:18.728
[male on phone]
'Just let him know
the paperwork'

22:18.815 --> 22:22.428
'from his recent investment
is on its way.'

22:22.515 --> 22:23.907
Uh, there-there must
be a mistake.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.040
I was told that
investment didn't happen.

22:26.127 --> 22:27.694
[male on phone]
'No, sir. He should begin
to receive dividends'

22:27.781 --> 22:30.131
'in about six weeks.'

22:30.218 --> 22:31.350
[elevator bell dings]

22:34.178 --> 22:36.006
[Serena]
'I don't care what
my mother says.'

22:36.093 --> 22:37.573
Poppy Lifton must pay.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.619
I knew you'd come
to your senses.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.535
Ta-da!

22:47.627 --> 22:48.671
Hello.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.241
Sherilyn Phillips.

22:53.328 --> 22:56.113
My daddy's got a piece
of the oil sands up in Alberta.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.464
'A piece of the size
of Florida.'

22:58.551 --> 23:00.335
I'm so excited to meet
my first New York friend

23:00.422 --> 23:01.380
for tea tomorrow.

23:02.293 --> 23:03.599
Maybe you know her?

23:03.686 --> 23:05.035
Poppy Lifton?

23:06.950 --> 23:07.908
[chuckles]

23:09.562 --> 23:11.433
Nice to meet you, Sherilyn.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.355
[instrumental music]

23:23.532 --> 23:25.491
What do you think?

23:25.578 --> 23:27.188
[sniffs]

23:30.060 --> 23:31.932
I sense aspiration

23:32.019 --> 23:34.543
yearning, striving
to be accepted.

23:34.630 --> 23:36.415
But then..

23:36.502 --> 23:38.155
there's this appealing
counter note

23:38.242 --> 23:41.028
of sincerity and optimism.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.726
This is the story
of a young girl

23:43.813 --> 23:45.641
who is enjoying
her first taste

23:45.728 --> 23:47.426
of the spoils of dirty oil.

23:49.384 --> 23:50.864
It's perfection.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.866
Well, there's
no detail too small

23:52.953 --> 23:54.737
to make sure Poppy Lifton
goes down hard.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.391
'And you still think
this is a better idea'

23:56.478 --> 23:57.740
than just calling the cops?

23:57.827 --> 23:58.828
It's better than
my mother's version

23:58.915 --> 24:00.047
of sleeping with the enemy.

24:00.134 --> 24:01.570
This will work.

24:01.657 --> 24:04.225
Georgina has a recording device
in her handbag.

24:04.312 --> 24:05.661
Once we get Poppy on tape

24:05.748 --> 24:07.837
talking money,
we can blackmail her

24:07.924 --> 24:09.839
into handing over
the cash.

24:09.926 --> 24:12.363
Yeah, and if Poppy got arrested
she'll never give up the money.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.104
'And as annoyed as I am
with Dan right now'

24:14.191 --> 24:16.019
it is his college tuition.

24:16.106 --> 24:18.021
Okay, but how do we even
know she's gonna show up?

24:18.108 --> 24:20.241
She thinks Gabriel
took the fall.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.722
All she's worried about
right now is party invitations

24:22.809 --> 24:24.332
and keeping a front row
seat at Bryant Park.

24:24.419 --> 24:25.725
And she's greedy.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.641
[cell phone ringing]

24:31.121 --> 24:32.383
- Hello?
- 'Hey.'

24:32.471 --> 24:34.081
You said the Gabriel deal
was a scam

24:34.168 --> 24:36.213
so why is my dad getting
a call about future dividends?

24:36.300 --> 24:37.954
I don't know.
Why don't you call my mom?

24:38.041 --> 24:39.608
'You seem to like to
talk to her these days.'

24:39.695 --> 24:41.828
[scoffs]
Come on.
What was I supposed to do?

24:41.915 --> 24:43.656
I mean, it's not exactly
fair of you to ask me

24:43.743 --> 24:46.659
to trust the return of my
tuition to Blair and Chuck.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.312
I told you I would
take care of it

24:48.399 --> 24:49.966
and that's what
I'm doing right now.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.621
I hope you don't expect me
to drink alcohol in this scheme.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.276
It's the Russian Tea Room.
You can drink tea.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.669
Serena, what are you doing?

24:56.756 --> 24:58.975
Uh, I'm in the elevator.
I'm losing you. Sorry.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.023
[elevator bell dings]

25:05.460 --> 25:06.679
Eric said Lily's at Barney's

25:06.766 --> 25:07.723
so we should have
at least a couple hours.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.333
I hope she likes
all of this.

25:09.420 --> 25:12.119
Aw, dad, you're nervous.
That's so cute!

25:12.206 --> 25:15.209
Hey, do not call
your father cute.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.298
Dad, Lily's gonna love
the proposal.

25:17.385 --> 25:18.778
I hope so.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.910
It's not exactly fireworks
over the Eiffel Tower

25:20.997 --> 25:22.433
or a G-5.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.218
No, but you got
her favorite flowers

25:24.305 --> 25:26.176
and tracked down
her favorite wine.

25:26.263 --> 25:27.569
You bought
Bespoke chocolates.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.571
And you made
all her favorite foods.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.791
Although I still think
that spare ribs and scallops

25:31.878 --> 25:33.401
are kinda gross together.

25:33.488 --> 25:35.751
If you're trying to make me
feel better, you're failing.

25:35.838 --> 25:40.060
Look, all I'm saying is that
big proposals are great, sure.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.670
But yours is something
more important.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.063
It shows that
you really know her

25:43.150 --> 25:45.544
and you love her
for who she is.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.503
You're right.
I do.

25:48.590 --> 25:49.765
[elevator bell dings]

25:49.852 --> 25:51.288
Quick.
Buy me five minutes.

25:51.375 --> 25:52.376
Yeah, I'm on it.

25:54.683 --> 25:55.945
- Hi.
- Oh, Jenny.

25:56.032 --> 25:57.556
I wasn't expecting
to see you.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.296
Uh, yeah, I know.
I, um, wanted you to..

25:59.383 --> 26:00.471
Here I'll take those.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.778
Show me that Marchesa dress

26:02.865 --> 26:03.910
'that you wore last week.'

26:03.997 --> 26:04.911
'I loved the zippers.'

26:13.572 --> 26:16.487
[instrumental music]

26:21.710 --> 26:23.277
Hey, we need to talk.

26:23.364 --> 26:24.365
Can't we talk inside?

26:24.452 --> 26:25.888
We need to talk about Blair.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.629
Trouble in paradise?

26:27.716 --> 26:30.153
Listen, a couple days ago, you
told me you were done with her.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.633
And then you went and you did
everything you could

26:31.720 --> 26:33.461
to try and get close
to her again.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.333
If you have a problem with
my proximity to your girlfriend

26:36.420 --> 26:37.944
maybe you should ask
Serena not to get herself

26:38.031 --> 26:39.162
into so much trouble.

26:39.249 --> 26:40.599
You know what
I couldn't figure out

26:40.686 --> 26:42.165
is why you would go out
of your way to lie to me

26:42.252 --> 26:43.514
about how you felt.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.168
Then I realized,
you're not lying to me.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.822
You're lying to yourself.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.956
That's a lovely theory
you've concocted, Nathaniel.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.435
You should have it published.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.046
Now if you'll excuse me.

26:53.133 --> 26:55.048
No, no. Look, you had
your shot, and you blew it.

26:55.135 --> 26:58.094
So why start
toying with her again?

26:58.181 --> 27:01.881
I mean, if you want her,
then man up and tell her.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.100
Otherwise you gotta
cut her loose.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.449
You gotta cut her loose

27:05.536 --> 27:06.712
and you gotta do it
for real this time, man

27:06.799 --> 27:08.061
because I want her.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.893
Bella's so in love with him,
even though he's a vampire.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.677
Maybe it's because
he's a vampire. I don't know.

27:15.764 --> 27:17.418
'But the thing is his family
doesn't suck the blood.'

but the problem is Edward.'

The more he falls
in love with her--

27:21.161 --> 27:23.206
Jenny. Jenny.
Jus-just one minute, Jenny.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.643
- Okay.
- Okay. Hello?

27:26.122 --> 27:27.297
Yes. Okay.

27:27.384 --> 27:30.126
- Um. I'm gonna..
- Oh. Okay.

27:30.213 --> 27:32.825
Thank you. Bye.

27:32.912 --> 27:35.958
Hi. I'm sorry, Daniel.
What-what was your question?

27:36.045 --> 27:37.481
Well, I got nowhere
with Serena on this

27:37.568 --> 27:39.092
so maybe you have
an answer for me.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.398
'Why is my dad getting
calls about dividends?'

27:41.485 --> 27:44.575
Did you-did you not get
his money back?

27:44.663 --> 27:47.274
Um...I did.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.755
I put it in a very
safe mutual fund

27:49.842 --> 27:52.148
that will pay him
dividends each month.

27:52.235 --> 27:54.368
Okay. Then, uh, then what is
Serena still taking care of

27:54.455 --> 27:57.284
'at the Russian Tea Room
right now?'

27:57.371 --> 27:58.459
[cell phone ringing]

27:59.634 --> 28:00.635
Hello?

28:00.722 --> 28:01.680
Serena, whatever you're doing

28:01.767 --> 28:03.159
I need you to stop right now.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.031
She can't just
get away with it.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.555
You can smile at Poppy
all you want, mom

28:07.642 --> 28:09.165
but I'm not like that
It's not right.

28:09.252 --> 28:10.950
Well, I will not tolerate you

in this situation.

and I am telling you'

It is nonnegotiable.'

28:18.305 --> 28:20.611
'Serena, do you hear me?'

28:20.699 --> 28:23.397
I'm sorry, mom.
I have to go.

28:23.484 --> 28:24.703
Serena, don't you dare.

28:33.842 --> 28:36.627
Hi. It's Lily Bass.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.281
Well, find him.

28:38.368 --> 28:39.935
I need to speak with him
right now.

Hi, are you Sherilyn?
I'm Poppy.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.784
Poppy, it's so nice
to meet you.

29:02.871 --> 29:06.266
But can Georgina still
speak Poppy's language?

29:11.271 --> 29:12.533
I'm just loving it here.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.146
Are you a Carrie?

29:17.233 --> 29:18.234
I'm a Charlotte.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.149
A Carrie?

29:20.236 --> 29:22.108
Um, yeah.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.152
I thought so.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.590
[indistinct conversations]

29:30.594 --> 29:31.857
Did you see Poppy's here?

29:31.944 --> 29:34.033
I did.
Georgina's going to text me

29:34.120 --> 29:36.035
as soon as she starts
talking money.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.906
Great.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.822
You look like
you could use a cocktail.

29:40.909 --> 29:42.171
You're too late.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.434
[chuckles]

29:44.521 --> 29:45.871
Wow.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.308
What?

29:48.395 --> 29:50.832
That's the first true laugh I've
gotten out of you in a while.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.488
Listen, Blair--

29:54.575 --> 29:56.403
No. Me first.

29:58.579 --> 30:00.450
Nate's waiting for me
to give him an answer.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.191
I heard.

30:02.278 --> 30:04.019
Don't you wanna know
what's stopping me?

30:06.500 --> 30:07.718
I can't answer his question

30:07.806 --> 30:10.809
while I'm waiting for you
to answer mine.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.680
The one I asked you
forever ago.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.206
What are we, Chuck?

30:17.293 --> 30:18.512
Blair..

30:18.599 --> 30:21.471
Last fall you said
we couldn't be together.

30:22.733 --> 30:25.258
And I believed you.

30:25.345 --> 30:27.869
But every time I try to move on,
you're right there.

30:29.697 --> 30:32.439
- Acting like--
- Acting like what?

30:32.526 --> 30:34.049
Like..

30:36.573 --> 30:39.750
Maybe you just want me
to be as unhappy as you are.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.405
I would never wish that
on anyone.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.540
I want you to be happy.

30:46.627 --> 30:49.238
Then look down deep

30:49.325 --> 30:52.894
into the soul
I know you have

30:52.981 --> 30:55.288
and tell me if what you feel
for me is real.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.553
Or if it's just a game.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.730
If it's real..

31:02.817 --> 31:05.254
...we'll figure it out.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.690
All of us.

31:09.171 --> 31:10.869
But if it's not..

31:16.831 --> 31:18.877
...then please, Chuck

31:18.964 --> 31:20.443
just let me go.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.112
[whispers]
It's just a game.

31:40.681 --> 31:41.769
'I hate to lose.'

31:44.598 --> 31:45.904
You're free to go.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.819
Thank you.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.612
Chuck, why did you
just do that?

32:03.704 --> 32:05.575
Because I love her.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.449
And I can't make her happy.

32:11.625 --> 32:14.976
New York is full of people
doing such amazing things.

bring wireless'

32:19.241 --> 32:20.851
What a great job.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.333
Yeah. It's-it's really
more of a passion than a job.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.118
I mean, it gives so much
to the children.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.467
Of course.

32:27.554 --> 32:29.425
I mean, they can look
at faraway places

32:29.512 --> 32:31.384
and-and read
Bible stories.

32:31.471 --> 32:34.213
And oh, well, they can download
Kirk Cameron movies.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.041
[laughs]Yeah.

32:36.128 --> 32:38.130
You know..

32:38.217 --> 32:40.959
I'd really love to be a part
of something like that.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.223
My father was really hoping
I'd find something philanthropic

32:44.310 --> 32:46.660
to do while I'm down here.

32:46.747 --> 32:49.054
I mean, you're such
a great girl.

32:49.141 --> 32:52.492
Look, if you can get me
a payment today

32:52.579 --> 32:54.407
I'll find a way
to get you in.

32:54.494 --> 32:55.495
Really?

32:56.713 --> 32:58.411
That would be amazing.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.500
I-I can't wait to help
the children.

33:00.587 --> 33:03.503
Um, let me just call the bank
to set up a wire transfer.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.070
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

33:05.157 --> 33:06.549
Just because of
the time crunch

33:06.636 --> 33:08.856
I'm afraid I'm only gonna
be able to accept cash.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.515
Hey, the police
just pulled up.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.517
The police? I thought Chuck
was calling his PI.

33:17.604 --> 33:20.172
- Wait, where is he?
- He left, believe it or not.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.565
But as long as Georgina
has Poppy on tape

33:22.652 --> 33:24.045
we can let the cops
arrest her.

33:24.132 --> 33:26.352
Well, text Georgina
Make sure she's ready.

33:26.439 --> 33:27.831
I'm gonna go talk
to the police.

Well, this is all the money
I have for...emergencies.

But if you let me
text my father

33:39.756 --> 33:41.845
I'm-I'm sure he can arrange
for something more.

33:41.932 --> 33:44.979
No, no, it's okay.

about is inside.

the answer is yes.

Why would they arrest Serena?

Where's Poppy?

Bible money.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.518
Oh, nice touch.

35:29.605 --> 35:31.085
But you texted me "All set"

35:31.172 --> 35:33.043
and Poppy was asking me
for a down payment

35:33.131 --> 35:35.089
and all I had was the money that
my camp gave me to buy Bibles.

35:35.176 --> 35:39.398

after all you've done?

anything wrong.

Look, I know how that sounds,
but I had no choice.

from the situation

to think things through.
