08:13.827 --> 08:16.127
     THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL
  MECHANISM THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN

08:16.129 --> 08:18.430
      WHY WE CHOOSE ONE DOG
   OVER ANOTHER TO BE OUR PET,

08:18.432 --> 08:21.132
     AND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE:
          FAMILIARITY.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.301
  JUST BECAUSE WE SEE SOMETHING
     AND GET EXPOSED TO IT,

08:23.303 --> 08:25.837
   IN THE FUTURE, WE LIKE IT.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.607
              SO IT LOOKS CALM.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.708
  AND INTELLIGENT.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.177
THIS IS AN INTELLIGENT DOG.

08:32.179 --> 08:36.448
Jon: LOOKING FOR A WELL MANNERED
    AND WISE-LOOKING PERSON,

08:36.450 --> 08:37.749
        GOOD TEMPERAMENT.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.717
 Brian: IT CAN BE WHY YOU CHOOSE
       TO DATE SOMEONE...

08:39.720 --> 08:41.385
   LOOK AT THIS GIGANTIC DOG!

08:41.388 --> 08:43.221
OH, HI!
        HI, GIGANTIC DOG!

08:43.222 --> 08:44.890
   ...WHY YOU CHOOSE THE HOUSE
   YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE IN...

08:44.892 --> 08:46.892
     SO STRONG, SILENT TYPE.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.628
 I'D LOOK FOR A MAN,
A LITTLE MACHO MAYBE.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.796
        BUT IS IT WHY WE
        CHOOSE OUR PETS?

08:51.798 --> 08:52.864
         LET'S FIND OUT.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.833
BEAUTIFUL, ALERT DOG.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.802
    Jon: DO YOU THINK WE'D BE
LOOKING WITH SOMEONE WITH BANGS?

09:00.140 --> 09:04.609
       TINY BASEBALL DOG.

09:04.611 --> 09:08.146
    THERE ARE OTHER THEORIES
  AS TO WHY PEOPLE CHOOSE DOGS.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.383
      SEEMS KIND OF TIMID,
         SUPER ADORABLE.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.052
    I WOULD LOOK FOR SOMEONE
     WHY KIND OF LOOKS SHY.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.488
      NOW, SOME EXPERTS SAY
   THAT WE VIEW MATES AND PETS

09:16.490 --> 09:18.089
  AS AN EXTENSION OF OURSELVES

09:18.091 --> 09:21.326
      WHILE OTHERS SAY THAT
  PEOPLE DESIRE WHAT THEY LACK,

09:21.328 --> 09:24.496
   SO A SHY PERSON MIGHT PICK
      A MORE OUTGOING DOG.

09:24.498 --> 09:27.032
Ginsberg: GREAT FAMILY DOG,
 AND HE SHOWS THAT.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.401
 HE WANTS TO GO PLAY
WITH THE OTHER DOGS.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.069
           Brian: GET OFF THERE!
                  OH, NICE.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.404
                    HEY!

09:32.406 --> 09:34.406
  WE'VE LOOKED AT ALL 10 DOGS,
     AND I THINK BRIAN AND I

09:34.408 --> 09:35.774
     HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

09:35.776 --> 09:39.077
   OF WHAT PEOPLE WERE LOOKING
    FOR TO MATCH THESE PUPS.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.546
I MEAN, WE'RE LOOKING FOR, LIKE,
 THE BEAUTIFUL, EXPRESSIVE EYES.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.848
    WE'RE LOOKING FOR SHAGGY,
          UNKEMPT HAIR,

09:43.850 --> 09:45.617
          MAYBE SOMEONE
      WHO'S SLIGHTLY OLDER,

09:45.619 --> 09:48.486
  SOMEONE WHO'S MORE EXCITABLE
    AND SMILING ALL THE TIME.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.155
   I THINK WE HAVE THAT DOWN.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.557
 I ALSO FOUND MY NEW DOG, RIGHT?

09:52.559 --> 09:55.193
   YOU'RE COMING HOME WITH ME.

09:55.195 --> 09:59.197
      Narrator: COMING UP,
 BRIAN AND JON MEET THE OWNERS.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.666
  CAN YOU PICK WHO IS WITH WHO?

10:01.668 --> 10:03.535
                     OH, OH, OH!
             UH-HUH.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.303
            Narrator:
  IS IT POSSIBLE TO MATCH PUPS

10:05.305 --> 10:08.340
    AND THEIR PEOPLE JUDGING
      ONLY ON THEIR LOOKS?

10:08.342 --> 10:10.942
       DO DOGS REALLY LOOK
       LIKE THEIR OWNERS?

10:10.944 --> 10:11.943
       I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.944
        MAN!

10:12.946 --> 10:14.980
                     ♪♪

10:18.285 --> 10:20.285
                     ♪♪

10:22.456 --> 10:24.656
   TO TEST THE MYTH THAT DOGSLOK

10:24.658 --> 10:27.626
   JON AND BRIAN ARE CARRYING
      OUT THREE EXPERIMENTS

10:27.628 --> 10:30.962
      TO LOOK AT ALL ANGLES
  OF THIS SUPPOSED PHENOMENON.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.899
 FIRST UP, CAN THEY MATCH THESE
   10 PUPS WITH THEIR HUMANS?

10:37.137 --> 10:40.005
  WITH THE HELP OF REGINA CASH,
     AN EXPERT WHEN IT COMES

10:40.007 --> 10:42.540
          TO ASSESSING
     HUMAN FACIAL FEATURES,

10:42.542 --> 10:45.276
IT'S TIME FOR THE PEOPLE PARADE.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.045
             I JUST NEED HEIGHT.
              THAT'S ALL, YUP.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.947
                 I NEED LOTS
               OF GOOD HEIGHT.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.552
I THINK WE SHOULD CLOSE THE GATE
           SO THEY DON'T ESCAPE.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.987
        YEAH.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.057
JON, BRIAN AND REGINA TAKE THEIR
 TIME GETTING TO KNOW EVERYONE.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.425
                  CASSIDY!

11:00.427 --> 11:01.526
             HI, HOW'S IT GOING?

11:01.528 --> 11:03.395
              SHE'S GOT, LIKE,
            THE NICE, WAVY HAIR.

11:03.397 --> 11:05.363
  Cash: YEAH, DAINTY BALLERINA.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.932
            Narrator:
  THEN BEGINS THE MATCHMAKING.

11:07.934 --> 11:08.933
   OH, IT'S SOFT!

11:08.935 --> 11:10.969
                    WHOA!

11:10.971 --> 11:12.470
              I THINK THE TERM
              IS WELL GROOMED.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.072
I'LL PUT "SOFT MANE."

11:14.074 --> 11:16.274
       Cash: SPARKLY-EYED,
     FACE IS IN PROPORTION.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.643
                    VERY CLASSY.
             OOH!

11:18.645 --> 11:21.513
Cash: VERY WELL GROOMED,
VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.847
 REALLY GREAT EYES.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.948
              LIKE HAIR COLOR.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.384
 HAIR COLOR, RIGHT,
HER EYEBROW COLOR, SEE?

11:26.386 --> 11:28.453
    Narrator: IF THE MYTH IS
        TO BE BELIEVED...

11:28.455 --> 11:29.754
               ATHLETIC BUILD.

11:29.756 --> 11:32.724
  Brian: STICK YOUR TONGUE OUT
    LIKE YOU'RE A HAPPY DOG.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.092
                      VERY TALL.
           TALL, YES.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.360
       GREAT LITTLE SMILE.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.628
              AGILE.
Brian: HMM?

11:36.630 --> 11:38.163
               NO.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.632
            Narrator:
   ...PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
     WILL BE OBVIOUS ENOUGH

11:40.634 --> 11:43.568
       TO PICK THE PAIRS.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.637
     NOW WE'VE SEEN THE DOGS
        AND THEIR OWNERS,

11:45.639 --> 11:46.938
    BUT SEPARATELY OF COURSE.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.807
        AT FIRST GLANCE,
      IT SEEMS PRETTY EASY.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.443
  TEACUP CHIHUAHUA.

11:51.445 --> 11:52.777
          [ LAUGHTER ]

11:52.779 --> 11:56.047
     YOU KNOW, BIG BUFF DUDE
  PROBABLY HAS A BIG BUFF DOG.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.516
Cash: LOOK AT THE, YOU KNOW,
STATURE, THE MUSCLES.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.085
  BUT THEN THERE'S OTHER OWNERS
         THAT ARE HARDER

12:00.087 --> 12:01.386
   TO MATCH WITH THEIR DOGS...

12:01.388 --> 12:02.854
  THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.457
  ...UNTIL YOU TALK TO THEM FOR
  A BIT AND YOU SEE THEM SMILE,

12:05.459 --> 12:09.427
AND YOU GO, "WAIT, I THINK I SAW
  A DOG WITH A SIMILAR SMILE."

12:09.429 --> 12:10.962
       I'M GOING TO GO...
           I THINK...

12:10.964 --> 12:12.330
Brian: OH, YEAH!
             RIGHT?

12:12.332 --> 12:13.364
   Cash: TOTALLY.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.403
                   Brian:
  ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT OUR BOARD
      WITH ALL OUR OWNERS ON IT.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.705
      WE'LL PUT OUR MATCHES HERE
            AND THEN HIDDEN HERE

12:20.707 --> 12:22.407
            ARE ALL THE RESULTS.

12:22.409 --> 12:26.578
            Narrator:
 WITH THE HELP OF BOTH EXPERTS,
THEY'VE ASSEMBLED THEIR MATCHES.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.013
   Jon: CONTESTANT
 NUMBER ONE, ESTHER,

12:29.015 --> 12:31.549
   LOOKS FRIENDLY
 BUT ALSO CONFIDENT,

12:31.551 --> 12:35.019
AND SHE'S WELL GROOMED AND HAS
GOT A LIVELY, EXPRESSIVE FACE.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.222
    I THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE DOG
         THAT MATCHED THAT, HUH?

12:37.224 --> 12:40.024
IF THIS ISN'T HER DOG, WE SHOULD
JUST GIVE THIS DOG TO HER.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.192
        CODY!

12:41.194 --> 12:42.961
                HE WAS PRETTY
             DIFFICULT TO PLACE.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.497
         SO, THAT WAS THE ONE ME
  AND THE JUDGE WERE LOOKING AT.

12:45.499 --> 12:48.166
        I WAS PRETTY SURE I KNEW
       WHO THAT DOG BELONGED TO.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.235
WELL THEN, ON TOP OF IT,
 I THINK THAT LONG,

12:50.237 --> 12:51.669
    SLENDER LOOK

12:51.671 --> 12:53.705
KIND OF RULES THIS ONE OUT,
AND I THINK WE GOT TO GO

12:53.707 --> 12:55.073
        OPUS.
                      ALL RIGHT.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.407
     ALL RIGHT?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.076
            NEXT ONE IS GARRETT.

12:58.078 --> 13:01.479
   THE JUDGE SAID HE HAD A GREAT
       SMILE, SMOOTH, SOFT HAIR.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.348
      THAT LITTLE WAFT GOING ON.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.216
Jon: YEAH, AND I THINK IT WAS,
LIKE, BASED OFF OF ALL THOSE

13:05.218 --> 13:07.952
    THAT WE SAID,
REAL-LIFE TEDDY BEAR.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.320
           REAL-LIFE TEDDY BEAR.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.388
THAT'S JORDAN.
                   RIGHT.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.423
WE SAID THAT HER BUILD
     WAS PETITE,

13:12.425 --> 13:15.794
GREAT SMILE AND SPARKLY EYES.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.229
YEAH, IT'S, LIKE, FACE-FOR-FACE,
       I KIND OF THINK THE SAME,

13:18.231 --> 13:20.999
      DEFINITELY THE SAME HAPPY,
              ENLIGHTENED FACE.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.801
               THAT'S THE ONE.

13:22.803 --> 13:23.968
                  TO MARIO.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.103
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE
  THAT THE BIGGEST,

13:25.105 --> 13:27.872
BUFFEST DUDE HAS GOT
THE TINIEST, CUTEST DOG.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.107
   IF WE'RE GOING
  PURELY ON LOOKS,

13:29.109 --> 13:31.376
   I HAVE TO SAY,
IT'S THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.410
       I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.511
                    MAN.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.313
 BIG DUDE, BIG DOG.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.514
                    THAT'S SARA.
ALL RIGHT.

13:36.516 --> 13:40.118
WE SAID SHE LOOKS SHY
AND HAS EMOTIVE EYES,

13:40.120 --> 13:41.753
 AND WE WENT WITH...

13:41.755 --> 13:43.221
         OH!

13:43.223 --> 13:48.693
THE DOG I CALLED BASEBALL DOG
BECAUSE OF HIS BASEBALL SHIRT.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.395
       HALEY!

13:50.397 --> 13:52.797
OKAY, SO OUR JUDGE SAID
 SHE HAD GREAT EYES,

13:52.799 --> 13:55.633
 AND I DESCRIBED HER
AS HAVING QUIET CONFIDENCE.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.468
THIS IS WHAT WE SAID.
                        PETUNIA?

13:57.470 --> 13:59.337
  NEXT PERSON, MAX.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.106
       WE SAID IN TERMS OF BUILD
               THAT HE'S BUFF,

14:02.108 --> 14:03.741
             BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
               THAT HE'S TALL,

14:03.743 --> 14:05.343
   SO NOT NECESSARILY A BIG DOG,

14:05.345 --> 14:08.146
           JUST A DOG THAT'S GOT
             PHYSICALITY TO IT.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.547
Brian: THAT'S THE ONE.

14:09.549 --> 14:14.185
OKAY, SO THAT GENTLEMAN IS MARK,
AND WE SAID HE WAS CLASSY,

14:14.187 --> 14:17.422
  CASUAL, FRIENDLY,
  ALERT AND AGILE,

14:17.424 --> 14:20.124
SO LAST BUT DEFINITELY
NOT LEAST IS CASSIDY,

14:20.126 --> 14:21.893
   WHO WE SAID HAD
 SPARKLY BLUE EYES.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.128
I'M PRETTY SURE OUR JUDGE
REGINA SAID SHE WAS, LIKE,

14:24.130 --> 14:25.463
     ALMOST HAD
A BALLERINA'S BUILDING.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.999
            Brian: THAT'S A LEAN
              AND POWERFUL DOG.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.934
        LOOKING BACK AT OUR LIST
             OF DOGS AND PEOPLE,

14:29.936 --> 14:31.736
          AND I'M PRETTY PLEASED
       WITH THE CONNECTION HERE.

14:31.738 --> 14:32.837
       I KNOW.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.539
   I'M SEEING THAT
PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP

14:34.541 --> 14:36.507
BETWEEN DOG AND OWNER.

14:36.509 --> 14:40.979
I GUESS IT'S TIME TO SEE
  IF WE WERE RIGHT.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.114
  BUT, BEFORE THE GRAND REVEAL,

14:43.116 --> 14:45.783
      IT'S BACK TO THE MYTH
     OF "DYNAMITE DEPOSIT."

14:45.785 --> 14:47.685
           Jon: THREE, TWO, ONE!

14:50.557 --> 14:55.693
IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE TO BLOW UP
 A SIZEABLE SAFE FROM THE INSIDE

14:55.695 --> 14:58.296
     AND KEEP THE BANK BILLS
        FROM BEING BURNED

14:58.298 --> 15:00.031
    OR SHREDDED IN THE BLAST?

15:00.033 --> 15:04.535
   IT SEEMS UNLIKELY, BUT THE
  MYTHBUSTERS ARE ON THE CASE.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.938
      TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND
 WHAT HAPPENS WITH AN EXPLOSION

15:06.940 --> 15:08.439
         INSIDE A SAFE,

15:08.441 --> 15:09.841
       WELL, YOU'RE GOING
      TO NEED A CLEAR SAFE,

15:09.843 --> 15:10.842
         AND THEY DON'T
       REALLY SELL THOSE,

15:10.844 --> 15:14.479
SO WE'RE GOING TO BUILD OUR OWN.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.915
   IT'S LIKE I'M BREAKING INTO
    THE SAFE I BUILT MYSELF.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.222
             TA-DA!

15:24.224 --> 15:27.058
   BEFORE WE START BLOWING UP
      OUR CLEAR MINI-SAFES,

15:27.060 --> 15:29.394
    WE'RE GOING TO DO A NAKED
   EXPLOSION ON THIS PLATFORM

15:29.396 --> 15:31.095
         SO WE CAN STUDY
        IN MINUTE DETAIL

15:31.097 --> 15:34.032
         THE PROPERTIES
   OF A HIGH-EXPLOSIVE BLAST.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.534
      NOW, WHEN WE BLEW UP
   OUR REAL SAFE IN THE FIELD,

15:36.536 --> 15:39.771
        WE USED A BINARY
   OR TWO-PART HIGH EXPLOSIVE,

15:39.773 --> 15:42.974
    BUT FOR OUR SMALL SCALE,
    WE'LL BE USING DET CORD.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.243
    ONE CANDLE FOR THIS CAKE.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.645
     DET CORD IS A ROPE-LIKE
 CONFIGURATION OF HIGH EXPLOSIVE

15:47.647 --> 15:51.349
   WITH A BLAST FORCE OF OVER
     20,000 FEET PER SECOND.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.551
   Narrator: USING THE BINARY
      EXPLOSION IN THE SHOP

15:53.553 --> 15:55.520
 IS A LEGAL AND SAFETY CONCERN,

15:55.522 --> 15:58.923
        SO DET CORD WITH
  A SIMILAR DETONATION VELOCITY

15:58.925 --> 16:00.825
    IS A CONVENIENT ANALOGUE.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.094
              Brian: ALL RIGHT.

16:03.096 --> 16:07.165
   UNPROTECTED PIECE OF DET CORD
             IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.069
WOO!
             THAT WAS ENERGETIC.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.771
        AND TO APPRECIATE
    THE SCALE OF THE ENERGY,

16:13.773 --> 16:15.006
     HERE'S THE HIGH-SPEED.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.374
  THREE, TWO, ONE.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.715
      EVEN AT 65,000 FRAMES
          PER SECOND...

16:23.717 --> 16:25.450
           PAUSE IT, AND YOU CAN
             GO FRAME BY FRAME.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.820
        ...IT FLASHES BY
     IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.888
BOOM!
              OOH, LOOK AT THAT!

16:30.890 --> 16:32.623
      THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.593
    YOU HAVE THIS SOLID FIREBALL
              JUST IN THE SHAPE

16:35.595 --> 16:37.095
              OF THAT CYLINDER,
              LIKE THE CORD IS.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.396
  AND IT EVENS OUT.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.464
    LOOK AT THAT.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.366
IT'S JUST A BIG BALL NOW.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.335
         WONDER HOW THAT WILL BE
 ANY DIFFERENT INSIDE THAT SAFE.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.872
          TO FIND OUT,
    CUE THE SEE-THROUGH SAFE.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.040
                 IN THREE...

16:49.042 --> 16:50.775
     THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE
       SOME BACK PRESSURE,

16:50.777 --> 16:52.577
        AND THAT'S WHERE
  THE SCIENCE GETS INTERESTING.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.578
                  ...TWO...

16:53.580 --> 16:55.246
WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT FLAME FRONT

16:55.248 --> 16:57.248
         WITH THE EXTRA
     CONFINEMENT OF A SAFE?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.249
                   ...ONE.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.518
           Both: WHOA!

17:00.520 --> 17:03.121
AND THAT'S WHY WE STAND
BEHIND BLAST SHIELDS.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.861
                     ♪♪

17:09.863 --> 17:11.396
          AH, THAT'S INCREDIBLE!

17:13.366 --> 17:16.834
  RIGHT, SO THAT MEANS THAT SAFE
 HAS ENOUGH STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY

17:16.836 --> 17:19.303
  TO HOLD IT TOGETHER WHILE THAT
   PRESSURE WAVE IS BUILDING UP,

17:19.305 --> 17:21.606
           WHICH MEANS ALL SORTS
               OF [INDISTINCT]

17:21.608 --> 17:24.442
           CRAZY THINGS GOING ON
            BEFORE THAT FINALLY,

17:24.444 --> 17:26.944
            POW, BLOWS IT APART.

17:26.945 --> 17:29.247
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY BONKERS.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.182
       WHEN OUR EXPLOSION
    WENT OFF INSIDE THE SAFE,

17:31.184 --> 17:33.217
  THAT FLAME FRONT HIT THE TOP,
        THEN THE BOTTOM,

17:33.219 --> 17:35.586
  THEN THE TOP UNTIL THE WALLS
      OF THE SAFE GAVE OUT,

17:35.588 --> 17:38.022
      AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
  BECAUSE IT'S THAT PHENOMENON

17:38.024 --> 17:40.158
   THAT MEANS THE FLAME LASTS
        FOUR TIMES LONGER

17:40.160 --> 17:43.561
     THAN IN AN UNCONTAINED
           EXPLOSION.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.029
      THAT MEANS ANY PAPER
         GOODS IN THERE

17:45.031 --> 17:47.965
  ARE GOING TO BE IN THAT FIRE
     FOR FOUR TIMES AS LONG,

17:47.967 --> 17:50.401
     SO THE QUESTION NOW IS,
       IS THAT LONG ENOUGH

17:50.403 --> 17:53.304
      AND HOT ENOUGH TO DO
    ANY DAMAGE TO THAT PAPER?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.339
     Narrator: COMING UP...
       STARTING DOWN AT THE END.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.875
      ...IT'S TIME FOR THE
     "BEST IN SHOW" RESULT.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.182
 ASSESSED
     Narrator: COMING UP...
   10 DOGS AND THEIR OWNERS...D.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.416
Jon: NO ONE HAS POOPED
  ON THE FLOOR YET,

18:05.418 --> 18:06.751
SO IT'S GOING TO BE HARD
 TO JUDGE THAT ONE.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.786
     ...AND PAIRED EACH PUP
         WITH THE HUMAN

18:08.788 --> 18:11.722
          THEY BELIEVE
     THEY RESEMBLE THE MOST.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.057
  THIS ONE IS HOT.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.927
   THE PROBABILITY OF GUESSING
     CORRECTLY IS ONE IN 10,

18:15.929 --> 18:17.829
     AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING
          TO THIS MYTH,

18:17.831 --> 18:20.998
        THEY SHOULD MATCH
  SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THAT,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.201
    STARTING WITH THESE TWO.

18:23.203 --> 18:27.171
                 ALL RIGHT.
       STARTING DOWN AT THE END.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.206
         OH!

18:28.208 --> 18:30.274
   WE WERE SO SURE
THAT THAT WAS HER DOG.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.710
          I SEE IT A LITTLE BIT,
BUT DEFINITELY THE BETTER MATCH.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.178
     ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL SWAP THEIR DOGS.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.746

      THAT'S NONE FROM TWO.

ALL RIGHT.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.931
      OH, YEAH!

18:53.933 --> 18:55.032
    I'LL TAKE IT.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.034
             CLEARLY THE CORRECT
                DOG FOR HER.

18:57.036 --> 19:00.972
OKAY, WAIT, THIS ONE IS EXTRA
SPECIAL TO ME BECAUSE I WAS,

19:00.974 --> 19:02.573
LIKE, ALMOST 100 PERCENT

19:02.575 --> 19:04.375
SURE THAT THIS DOG WAS HIS.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.044
ARE YOU READY?
                  YOU GO FOR IT.

19:07.046 --> 19:10.348
         OH!

19:10.350 --> 19:13.885
WE PICKED THE BIGGEST DOG,
BUT IT WASN'T QUITE RIGHT.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.320
              YOU READY FOR IT?
DO IT!

19:16.322 --> 19:18.222
         OH!

19:18.224 --> 19:19.957

19:33.239 --> 19:35.373
      OH, SNAP!

19:35.375 --> 19:36.941
   OKAY, LAST ONE.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.310

19:48.721 --> 19:50.221
      THE ONLY PROBLEM IS,
          THOSE PEOPLE

19:50.223 --> 19:53.024
         DIDN'T ACTUALLY
         OWN THOSE DOGS.

19:53.026 --> 19:57.495
WELL, ONE OUT OF 10, MAN,
10 PERCENT IS NOT A GREAT SCORE.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.664
  SO FAR, IT'S NOT
  LOOKING SO GOOD.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.898
   WE HAVE TO JUST PUT IT ON.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.500

    A GOOD START FOR THE MYTH

20:02.502 --> 20:04.335

20:09.242 --> 20:11.475
       TO THE PROCEEDINGS.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.145
  TO SEE IF THE SPECIFIC FACIAL
     FEATURES OF A DOG MATCH

20:14.147 --> 20:16.514
      THAT OF THEIR OWNER,
     WE'VE BROUGHT AN EXPERT

20:16.516 --> 20:18.382
IN THE STUDY OF FACIAL FEATURES,

20:18.384 --> 20:20.284
     A POLICE SKETCH ARTIST.

    WILL BE A LITTLE UNUSUAL.

     ON THOSE DESCRIPTIONS.

PERFECTLY SHAPED EARS.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.422

            THEIR PROPORTIONATE?

20:58.424 --> 20:59.457
   YES.
                          OKAY.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.525
            GO AHEAD AND TELL ME
               ABOUT HER EYES.

21:01.527 --> 21:04.762
SHE ACTUALLY HAS HETEROCHROMIA,
SO ONE EYE IS, LIKE, A BROWN,

23:06.819 --> 23:09.620
       OF THE SAME GENDER
       AND A SIMILAR AGE.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.055
        OKAY.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.490
I MEAN, LIKE, THE BIGGEST,
THE FIRST THING I'M NOTICING IS,

23:12.492 --> 23:14.225
 I'M TRYING TO MATCH
  THE FACIAL HAIR.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.227
    AND JON AND BRIAN SIMPLY
          HAVE TO MATCH

23:16.229 --> 23:18.929
       THE FORENSIC SKETCH
          TO THE OWNER.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.364
      NO, NO, NO.

23:20.366 --> 23:21.365
Brian: I HATE TO SAY THIS.

23:21.367 --> 23:23.634
I FEEL LIKE I'M LOOKING
    FOR SMEAGOL.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.969
      IF THE MYTH IS REAL,

23:24.971 --> 23:27.004
      THEN THEY SHOULD SEEK
      RECOGNIZABLE FEATURES

23:27.006 --> 23:29.206
          IN THE SKETCH
     IN THE RELEVANT OWNER.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.509
 LOOK AT THIS HAIR.
 LOOK AT THIS HAIR.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.110
  LOOK AT THE EYES.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.180
              HER, HER AND HER.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.815
                   NO, NO.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.017
        I THINK I'M DOWN TO JUST
              THOSE BOTTOM TWO.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.186
     ALL RIGHT.
ARE YOU GOING TO DRUMROLL ME IN?

23:42.188 --> 23:45.222
I THINK THAT THIS PERSON...

23:45.224 --> 23:46.357
      THAT GUY.

23:46.359 --> 23:49.960
              IT'S CLEARLY HER.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.295
              THAT'S TWINSIES.

23:51.297 --> 23:56.600
I THINK THAT THIS DOG
TURNED PORTRAIT BELONGS TO...

23:56.602 --> 23:58.068
        UGH!

24:00.106 --> 24:02.873
             THIS ONE OVER HERE.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.676
     I WANT TO GO WITH THIS GUY.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.412
            ARE YOU READY TO SEE
         WHO'S BEHIND THAT DOOR?

24:08.414 --> 24:10.181
YEAH, DON'T MAKE ME WAIT.
                       DRUMROLL?

24:10.183 --> 24:11.916
    YES, PLEASE.
     ALL RIGHT.

24:11.918 --> 24:15.653
REVEAL THE DOG AND OWNER
 IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.790
       COMING UP, BACK AT
     THE SMALL-SCALE BANK...

24:19.792 --> 24:21.959
          Jon: STACKS ON STACKS.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.428
    ...WILL THE APPROPRIATELY
       SIZED BANK BILLS...

24:24.430 --> 24:26.096
                    AND THREE...
          ...SURVIVE?

24:26.098 --> 24:27.364
                ...TWO, ONE!

24:32.271 --> 24:33.637
YTHBUSTERS" AND HEISTS...
                    AND THREE...
          ...SURVIVE?

24:33.639 --> 24:35.439
  IT HASN'T SET OFF
   THE ALARM YET.

24:35.441 --> 24:39.777
       ...GO TOGETHER LIKE
      CRIME AND PUNISHMENT.

24:39.779 --> 24:43.614
    WHY, THOR THE GOD OF THUNDER
 IS TRYING TO ENTER MY BUILDING.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.916
 CONTINUING THAT RICH LEGACY...

24:45.918 --> 24:48.319
                    ONE!

24:48.321 --> 24:50.788
        ...BRIAN AND JON
    ARE TESTING THE TALL TALE

24:50.790 --> 24:53.424
   OF THE ULTIMATE INSIDE JOB.

24:53.426 --> 24:56.126
     CAN YOU BLOW UP A SAFE
         FROM THE INSIDE

24:56.128 --> 24:57.862
   AND LEAVE THE LOOT INTACT?

24:57.864 --> 24:58.896
                    ONE!

25:01.467 --> 25:03.167
 Jon: OUR SMALL-SCALE EXPERIMENT
          HAS SHOWED US

25:03.169 --> 25:04.902
         THAT CONTAINING
     OUR DET CORD EXPLOSION

25:04.904 --> 25:06.804
  INSIDE OUR CLEAR ACRYLIC SAFE

25:06.806 --> 25:10.708
   HAS INCREASED THE EXISTENCE
  OF OUR FLAME FRONT FOURFOLD.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.109
      THAT MEANS, IF WE PUT
       MONEY INSIDE THERE,

25:12.111 --> 25:14.879
    IT'LL BE EXPOSED TO FIRE
     FOR LONGER, SO NEXT UP,

25:14.881 --> 25:16.447
       WE'RE GOING TO SEE
     WHAT IT ACTUALLY TAKES

25:16.449 --> 25:21.252
         TO IGNITE MONEY
        BY BURNING MONEY.

25:21.254 --> 25:24.488
    CHECK IT OUT.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.390
          EVERYTHING IS A HELMET
              TO YOU, ISN'T IT?

25:26.392 --> 25:27.424
        YES.

25:29.962 --> 25:33.497
         [ Laughing ] ALL RIGHT.
           PUT IT ON THE BURNER.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.699
      IT'S ILLEGAL TO BURN
         U.S. CURRENCY.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.635
        SO FOR OUR MYTH,
         WE'LL BE USING

25:37.637 --> 25:40.104
  TA-DA -- OFFICIAL MYTH MONEY.

25:40.106 --> 25:43.007
   Narrator: MADE WITH COTTON,
    THE MYTH DOLLAR WILL BURN

25:43.009 --> 25:45.409
 EXACTLY LIKE OFFICIAL CURRENCY,

25:45.411 --> 25:46.911
   AND NO ONE NEED GO TO JAIL.

25:46.913 --> 25:47.978
               NOW OUR BONDS.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.547
 IN ADDITION TO THE BANK BILLS,

25:49.549 --> 25:53.417
   THE GUYS ARE ALSO TOASTING
      BEARER BOND REPLICAS.

25:53.419 --> 25:56.353
           NOW PREHEAT YOUR OVEN
               TO 350 DEGREES

25:56.355 --> 25:58.355
              AND WAIT FOR YOU
              MONEY TO IGNITE.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.159
   HOW WE LOOKING?

26:02.161 --> 26:05.996
    WE ARE AT A MILD 138 DEGREES
             AND RISING ON BOTH

26:05.998 --> 26:07.264
                  THE MONEY
           AND THE BEARER BONDS.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.265
     OOH, DOPE.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.700
             THE BILL'S DANCING
                A LITTLE BIT.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.135
    OH, I SEE IT.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.636
   THEY'RE, LIKE,
 CONDUCTIVE HEATING.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.939
"I DON'T WANT TO DIE!"

26:14.941 --> 26:18.242
  IT'S FOR SCIENCE.
     IT'S OKAY.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.680
   Jon: ALL OF OUR MYTH MONEY
      AND OUR BEARER BONDS

26:22.682 --> 26:26.951
    BURST INTO FLAMES AROUND
     650 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

26:26.953 --> 26:29.520
      OH, THERE'S IGNITION.

26:29.522 --> 26:32.256
              ON BOTH OF THEM.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.391
 NOW WE CHECKED THE DATA SHEET,
  AND WE KNOW THAT OUR DET CORD

26:34.393 --> 26:38.629
   EXPLODES WITH A TEMPERATURE
  OF 7,500 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.297
       WOO, LOOK AT THAT!
            HEADS UP!

26:40.299 --> 26:41.332
OH, THERE GOES OUR MONEY, MAN.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.467
THERE'S OUR RETIREMENT SAVINGS.

26:43.469 --> 26:46.570
         OH.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.539
   OH, IT'S GONE.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.541
   YOU THINK THAT MONEY INSIDE
   A SAFE WITH THAT EXPLOSION

26:50.543 --> 26:52.409
       WOULD JUST GO BOOM,
         UP INTO FLAMES.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.546
  I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND A SWEET
    MUSTARD-BASED BARBECUE SAUCE

26:55.548 --> 26:58.248
                FOR THIS ONE.

26:58.250 --> 27:02.386
   BUT IGNITION IS A FUNCTION
        OF HEAT AND TIME.

27:02.388 --> 27:06.690
     FOR EXAMPLE, IF I SWEEP
     MY HAND OVER THIS FIRE,

27:06.692 --> 27:09.126
     I AM UNSCATHED BECAUSE
   THE AMOUNT OF TIME MY HAND

27:09.128 --> 27:11.228
       SPENDS IN THE FIRE
         IS NEGLIGIBLE,

27:11.230 --> 27:13.931
      BUT IF I HOLD MY HAND
         ABOVE THE FIRE,

27:13.933 --> 27:15.899
  EVENTUALLY I'LL BURN MYSELF.

27:15.901 --> 27:19.136
   I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT
     OUR MONEY WILL SURVIVE

27:19.138 --> 27:23.173
       THE FLAME GENERATED
        BY THE EXPLOSION.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.809
    Narrator: LET'S FIND OUT,
      FIRST IN SMALL SCALE.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.345
    THIS IS THE KIND OF SCORE
  OUR WOULD-BE THIEF IS HOPING

27:28.347 --> 27:30.514
        FOR WHEN HE BLOWS
      THAT BANK SAFE OPEN.

27:30.516 --> 27:36.920
     OH, YEAH, BEARER BONDS,
        STACKS ON STACKS.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.555
          LOOK AT THIS.

27:38.557 --> 27:41.058
            Narrator:
ONCE AGAIN, THE GUYS HAVE PRIMED
   A SHORT LENGTH OF DET CORD.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.760
         NICE AND TIGHT.

27:42.762 --> 27:47.931
            Narrator:
    IT'LL GENERATE SOMETHING
 IN THE REGION OF 7,500 DEGREES.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.433
                 ALL RIGHT.
                WE'RE READY.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.835
CLEAR MINI-SAFE FILLED
WITH MINI-MYTH MONEY

27:51.837 --> 27:56.173
AND MINI-MYTH BEARER BONDS
 IN THREE, TWO, ONE!

27:56.175 --> 27:57.207
         OH!

27:59.512 --> 28:01.011
        ONE!

28:01.013 --> 28:02.046
         OH!

28:04.550 --> 28:05.783
           THAT DOESN'T GET OLD.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.518
           LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK.
ALL RIGHT.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.386
      COMBINE A SMALL-SCALE
         HIGH EXPLOSIVE

28:09.388 --> 28:10.954
   WITH A SMALL-SCALE SAFE...

28:10.956 --> 28:12.589
                  OH, LOOK!

28:12.591 --> 28:15.426
        THIS IS NOT EVEN BURNED,
      THE STACK OF BEARER BONDS.

28:15.428 --> 28:17.227
        ...AND YOU END UP
    WITH RELATIVELY UNSCATHED

28:17.229 --> 28:19.163
  SMALL-SCALE BUNDLES OF MONEY.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.034
 Jon: IT SEEMS LIKE OUR WOULD-BE
 THIEF HAS A REALLY GOOD CHANCE

28:24.036 --> 28:25.736
         OF GETTING AWAY
       WITH A TON OF LOOT

28:25.738 --> 28:27.071
            BECAUSE,
    AFTER THE SAFE EXPLODES,

28:27.073 --> 28:29.506
ALL THE WALLS COME OFF PERFECTLY

28:29.508 --> 28:31.775
       AS THE MONEY TOSSES
       IN PERFECT BUNDLES

28:31.777 --> 28:36.313
SPINNING AROUND LIKE A BALLERINA
ON STAGE SLOWLY THROUGH THE AIR.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.249
          THEN WATCHED
     THE BEARER BONDS GO...

28:39.251 --> 28:42.019
     AND ALMOST LANDING BACK
        IN A PERFECT PILE

28:42.021 --> 28:44.888
          ON OUR LITTLE
       EXPLOSIVE PLATFORM.

28:44.890 --> 28:48.926
ALL THE BILLS AND ALL THE BEARER
  BONDS WERE PERFECTLY INTACT.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.828
      THAT'S KIND OF CRAZY.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.496
   WE'VE SEEN WHAT WE CAN SEE
        FROM SMALL-SCALE,

28:52.498 --> 28:54.331
        AND IT'S LOOKING
   PRETTY GOOD FOR THIS MYTH.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.333
 THOSE PAPER GOODS ARE MAKING IT
        OUT OF THAT SAFE

28:56.335 --> 28:57.935
      RELATIVELY UNSCATHED,

28:57.937 --> 28:59.269
  BUT WHEN WE GO TO FULL SCALE,

28:59.271 --> 29:00.838
        THAT LARGER SAFE
       IS GOING TO REQUIRE

29:00.840 --> 29:02.539
   MORE ENERGY TO BLOW APART.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.208
      IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN
        IF THAT PAPERWORK

29:04.210 --> 29:06.210
       IS GOING TO GET OUT
     IN THE SAME CONDITION.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.846
   IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
 IF THOSE SMALL-SCALE PRINCIPLE

29:08.848 --> 29:11.815
   APPLY TO OUR BIG-SCALE SAFE
      BECAUSE, IF THEY DO,

29:11.817 --> 29:14.651
   THAT ROBBER IS GOING TO BE
 MAKING OUT WITH A LOT OF LOOT.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.553
BRIAN, LET'S GO ROB A BANK!

29:16.555 --> 29:18.122
                  OH, YEAH.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.857
  WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
   TAKE THE MONEY.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.725
LUNCH IS ON ME, MAN.
   LUNCH IS ON ME.

29:21.727 --> 29:24.728
    YOU KNOW, THE FULL-SIZE SAFE
       WILL HAVE FULL-SIZE MONEY

29:24.730 --> 29:27.231
             THAT WILL BE EASIER
                TO PAY WITH.

29:27.233 --> 29:31.301
      Narrator: COMING UP,
      WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?

29:31.303 --> 29:32.903
          BEST DAY AT WORK, JON.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.074

29:41.013 --> 29:43.413
            Narrator:
 DO DOGS LOOK LIKE THEIR OWNERS?

29:43.415 --> 29:45.616
     JON AND BRIAN HAVE HAD
        A FORENSIC ARTIST

29:45.618 --> 29:48.318
   DRAW FIVE DOGS AS HUMANS...

29:48.320 --> 29:51.388
BEEF HAD, LIKE, URGH!

29:51.390 --> 29:53.257
     Jon: ALMOST LIKE CLOUDS ON,
             LIKE, A SUNNY DAY.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.126
           THEY'RE, LIKE, WHITE,
BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BLUE IN IT.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.363
  ...AND, FROM A LINEUP, PICKED
  THE HUMAN THEY MOST RESEMBLE.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.564
                    HER.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.267
    SO IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT
    HOW MANY THEY GOT RIGHT.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.669
FIRST UP, JACKSON THE DACHSHUND.

30:05.671 --> 30:07.337
     ALL RIGHT.
REVEAL THE DOG AND OWNER

30:07.339 --> 30:10.040
 IN THREE, TWO, ONE!

30:12.845 --> 30:14.144
 HEY!
                       Jon: OH!

30:14.146 --> 30:16.713
                 WE DID IT!
                THAT'S CRAZY!

30:16.715 --> 30:18.949
     IT'S JUST INTERESTING THAT,
              LIKE, THAT SKETCH

30:18.951 --> 30:20.951
                DOESN'T LOOK
              LIKE HER EXACTLY,

30:20.953 --> 30:23.320
     BUT OUT OF ALL THE PICTURES
             OF PEOPLE UP THERE,

30:23.322 --> 30:25.856
              THAT SKETCH LOOKS
             THE MOST LIKE HER.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.325
I GOT TO SAY, I FEEL LIKE YOU
 LOOK LIKE YOUR DOG,

30:28.327 --> 30:29.960
 AND I THINK THAT'S
    A COMPLIMENT.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.162
        THE GUYS ARE OFF
       TO A STRONG START.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.198
   NEXT UP IS JADA THE HUSKY.

30:34.200 --> 30:38.135
            ACTUAL DOG AND OWNER
             IN THREE, TWO, ONE!

30:39.171 --> 30:41.672
        WHOA!

30:41.674 --> 30:43.440
  I CAN SAFELY SAY
THAT I DID NOT PICK ARIA

30:43.442 --> 30:45.142
AS THE OWNER OF JADA
   AT ALL IN THIS.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.844
   THAT'S A SWING AND A MISS.

30:46.846 --> 30:48.011
         NEXT IS ROSIE.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.314
  THREE, TWO, ONE!

30:53.786 --> 30:56.320
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE
A LITTLE BIT OFF THERE.

30:56.322 --> 30:57.521
                 I WAS OFF.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.090
  AND, ONCE AGAIN, IT'S A FAIL,

31:00.092 --> 31:04.995
    A RESULT THAT'S REPEATED
        TWO MORE TIMES...

31:04.997 --> 31:07.531

 MEANT TO LOOK LIKE.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.233

31:09.235 --> 31:11.602
      ...MEANING THIS MYTH

31:11.604 --> 31:13.670

31:16.442 --> 31:17.941

           OH, LOOK AT THIS PUP!

31:21.814 --> 31:23.080
BEST DAY AT WORK, JON.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.515
              YEAH, I THINK SO.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.517

MORE FUN THAN LAST TIME

 A FORENSIC ARTIST.

31:29.154 --> 31:33.457
   YEAH, I MEAN, WE CAME UP WITH
 SOME PRETTY HILARIOUS SKETCHES,

31:33.459 --> 31:36.226
         BUT IN THE END, WE ONLY
           GOT 20 PERCENT RIGHT.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.961
   WELL, YOU KNOW
  WHAT THAT MEANS.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.396

HAVE TO DO MORE TESTING,

31:39.398 --> 31:41.698
 WHICH MEANS PLAYING
WITH SOME MORE DOGS.

31:41.700 --> 31:42.799

31:45.971 --> 31:47.871

       WE WANT TO FIND OUT

31:47.873 --> 31:51.008

     NON-DOG-OWNERS PREFER.

  IF YOU WERE TO CHOOSE ONE DOG
    TO TAKE HOME AS YOUR OWN,

31:53.779 --> 31:55.279
   WHICH ONE WOULD YOU CHOOSE?

31:55.281 --> 31:59.316
 THE KIND OF DOG I WOULD LOVE TO
 HAVE WOULD BE A LONG-HAIRED...

31:59.318 --> 32:01.752
     CUTE LITTLE PERKY EARS
         AND SHORT LEGS.

32:01.754 --> 32:02.953
     PROBABLY WOULD BE BIG.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.488
        WARM, BROWN EYES.

32:04.490 --> 32:07.090
    IT'D BE FLUFFY AND SOFT.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.360
  WE WANT TO FIND OUT IF PEOPLE
    INTENTIONALLY CHOOSE DOGS

32:10.362 --> 32:13.430
   THAT LOOK LIKE THEMSELVES.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.400
  Narrator: YEP, AFTER A YAPPY
     HOUR MIX AND MINGLE...

32:16.402 --> 32:17.801
                     HI!

32:17.803 --> 32:21.238
     ...THESE 10 PEOPLE WILL
    PICK THEIR PERFECT POOCH.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.207

              LOOK AT HIS FACE!

32:24.209 --> 32:25.842
 Brian: WHAT OUR NON-DOG-OWNERS
           DON'T KNOW

32:25.844 --> 32:27.978
   IS THAT WE'VE SELECTED ONE
       OUT OF THE 10 DOGS

32:27.980 --> 32:30.280
     AS A PLANT THAT WE FEEL
        LOOKS LIKE THEM.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.615
WE'RE MAKING FRIENDS HERE.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.017
      WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW
        FOR THIS TEST IS,

32:34.019 --> 32:37.354
    WILL THOSE PEOPLE SELECT
THEIR DOGGY DOPPELGANGER PLANTS?

32:37.356 --> 32:39.323
               SO MUCH FLUFF!

32:39.325 --> 32:40.324
         THAT ONE I REALLY LOVE.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.693
                    WOW.

32:42.695 --> 32:45.228
  Narrator: THIS EXPERIMENT IS
   BASED ON A WELL ESTABLISHED

32:45.230 --> 32:47.331
      PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.333
     Jon: EVERY DAY, WE SEE
      OURSELVES IN MIRRORS,

32:49.335 --> 32:51.568
    PICTURES, AND OTHER SORTS
         OF REFLECTIONS.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.237
   NOW SCIENCE SUGGESTS THAT,
    ON AN UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL,

32:54.239 --> 32:56.239
     WE GROW FOND OF THINGS
          WE SEE OFTEN,

32:56.241 --> 32:58.108
     IN THIS CASE OUR FACES.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.910
        SO WHEN DOGS LOOK
       LIKE THEIR OWNERS,

32:59.912 --> 33:01.511
      THEY'RE PLAYING INTO
     THAT MIRRORING EFFECT,

33:01.513 --> 33:03.447
      BECOMING A REFLECTION
        OF THEIR OWNERS.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.282
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GRAVITATING TOWARDS THIS DOG?

33:05.284 --> 33:08.652
         IT LOOKS LIKE A PILLOW,
        AND IT'S JUST SO FLUFFY.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.922
       I WANT TO TAKE HOME
  ALL 11 OF THEM, INCLUDING BO.

33:11.924 --> 33:13.190
            Brian: INCLUDING BO!

33:16.228 --> 33:19.162
             Brian:
 WE'VE GIVEN OUR 10 SINGLES TIME
   TO MINGLE AT THE BARK BAR.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.731
     NOW THAT THEY HAVE TIME
      TO MAKE A SELECTION,

33:20.733 --> 33:21.832
        THEY'RE GOING TO
        REVEAL IT TO US,

33:21.834 --> 33:23.400
          AND WE'LL SEE
    IF THEY MATCHED THE DOGS

33:23.402 --> 33:24.768

33:24.770 --> 33:26.136
  THIS GOLDEN RETRIEVER CLEARLY.

33:26.138 --> 33:28.805
  Narrator: BRIAN AND JON HAVE
   PRESELECTED THEIR MATCHES.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.741
    HEY, I REALLY
   LIKE THIS ONE.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.843
WE GOT STEWART WITH ARTHUR.

33:32.845 --> 33:35.846
    NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT
IF THE THEORY OF SELECTING A DOG

33:35.848 --> 33:39.516
   BASED ON HOW MUCH THEY LOOK
      LIKE YOU IS CORRECT.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.752
    WHICH ONE DID YOU CHOOSE?

33:41.754 --> 33:44.988
                I PICK PENNY.

33:46.925 --> 33:48.792
             GREAT.
  Narrator: IT'S A GREAT START.

33:48.794 --> 33:53.330
    THE PHYSICAL RESEMBLANCE
       IS OBVIOUS, BUT...

33:53.332 --> 33:54.331
      STEWART!

33:54.333 --> 33:55.832
                    YEAH.

                GO WITH THOR.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.204
    IT GOES DOWNHILL RAPIDLY.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.373
       I HAVE TO GO WITH NIMBUS.

34:05.344 --> 34:09.579
           IF I HAD TO PICK ONE,
 IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE PEE-WEE.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.649

                TO GO WITH...

               OH!

34:21.025 --> 34:24.928

  IT'S A CLEAR RESULT, AND NOT
    JUST IN THE FINAL ROUND.

      ONLY A SINGLE CORRECT

36:14.006 --> 36:15.338
 FOR OUR PROOF OF CONCEPT TEST,

36:15.340 --> 36:17.574
       WE USED FOUR STICKS
       OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES

36:19.244 --> 36:23.680

38:34.513 --> 38:37.480
     ALL RIGHT.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.215
                 ALL RIGHTY.

38:39.217 --> 38:41.318
              Jon:
 NOW, WE'VE BEEN FEELING OUR WAY
 TO SEE HOW MUCH HIGH EXPLOSIVES

38:41.320 --> 38:44.154
      IT WOULD TAKE TO BLOW
     A SAFE OPEN LIKE THIS,

38:44.156 --> 38:45.755
       AND OUR DEMOLITIONS
       EXPERT HAS TOLD US

38:45.757 --> 38:50.026
THAT THIS IS THE SMALLEST AMOUNT
 WE CAN USE TO GET THE JOB DONE.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.662
      IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,
    THEN THIS MYTH IS BLOWN.

38:52.664 --> 38:56.333
  Narrator: THEY'RE GOING AGAIN
 WITH A NEW SAFE AND 0.3 POUNDS.

38:56.335 --> 38:58.234
       Jon: AND EXPLOSIVE.

38:58.236 --> 39:00.570
   LET'S CLOSE IT REAL GENTLY.

39:00.572 --> 39:05.742
            Narrator:
 IT'S THE BARE MINIMUM THAT WILL
CRACK OPEN THE STEEL SAFETY BOX.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.178
                 I SURE AM A
          TRUSTING BANK MANAGER.

39:08.180 --> 39:11.214
 JON AND BRIAN ARE WALKING AWAY
         FAKE-MONEY RICH

39:11.216 --> 39:14.084
      OR WITH A BUSTED MYTH
         ON THEIR HANDS.

39:14.086 --> 39:15.685
HIT THE BUNKER?
                 OH, ABSOLUTELY.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.221
LET THE HEIST BEGIN.

39:22.260 --> 39:23.827
     WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
        ON "MYTHBUSTERS"

39:23.829 --> 39:26.196
  WE'D RAMP AN EXPLOSION DOWN?

39:26.198 --> 39:30.667
  I GUESS THERE'S A FIRST TIME
         FOR EVERYTHING.

39:30.669 --> 39:35.739
    OKAY, OUR BEST-CASE SCENARIO
             IN THREE, TWO, ONE!

39:37.442 --> 39:38.708
Brian: OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL!
    LOOK AT THAT.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.478
THE SAFE IS JUST BLOWN MAYBE,
 LIKE, 30 FEET BACK

39:41.480 --> 39:42.912
  INSTEAD OF BEING
 TOTALLY DESTROYED.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.414
    YEAH, IT OPENED UP LIKE THIS

39:44.416 --> 39:46.750
          INSTEAD OF HAVING EACH
       INDIVIDUAL PIECE FLY OUT.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.218
  OH, I GOT TO GET
 OUT THERE AND LOOK.

39:48.220 --> 39:51.087
                    YEAH.
      OUR MONEY IS BLOWING AWAY!

39:51.089 --> 39:55.024
            Narrator:
  THE REAL-TIME EVIDENCE SHOWS
 SUBSTANTIALLY LESS DESTRUCTION,

39:55.026 --> 39:58.228
  AND ALTHOUGH THE CAMERAS TOOK
  A BEATING, THEY DID SURVIVE.

39:58.230 --> 40:01.498
   OOH, BOY, THAT
 DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.532
   STILL ROLLING!

40:02.534 --> 40:06.202
DID YOU TAKE THAT DOOR
    TO THE FACE?

40:06.204 --> 40:07.637
    GOOD ON YOU.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.206
  BUT COULD FRAGILE BANK BILLS
         REALLY SURVIVE

40:10.208 --> 40:12.842
       A BLAST LIKE THIS?

40:12.844 --> 40:14.644
             OOH, LOOK AT THIS.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.846
        INCREDIBLY, YES.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.715
        BESIDES, LIKE, THE THREE
     OR SO THERE THAT ARE BURNT,

40:18.717 --> 40:21.451
                 THE REST OF
             THIS MONEY IS FINE.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.652
      Jon: HOW ABOUT THAT?

40:22.654 --> 40:24.587
     WE PUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT
          OF EXPLOSIVES

40:24.589 --> 40:26.890
     INSIDE A SAFE AND BOOM!

40:26.892 --> 40:29.426
           CASH MONEY.

40:31.396 --> 40:33.830
 LOOK AT THIS, JON.
THAT IS A FAT STACK.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.968
 I MEAN, THIS STUFF
IS COMPLETELY INTACT.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.471
           YEAH, LIKE, PRISTINE.

40:41.473 --> 40:44.274
 I THINK OUR BANK ROBBER HAS GOT
   AN EARLY RETIREMENT COMING.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.544
             Brian:
 WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS MYTH IS,

40:47.546 --> 40:50.246
     WE STARTED WAY TOO BIG
      BLOWING A SAFE APART,

40:50.248 --> 40:51.915
         WENT MID-RANGE
     AND LEARNED SOME STUFF

40:51.917 --> 40:54.384
    AND THEN WENT AS SMALL AS
PERSONAL TO MAKE THIS MYTH WORK,

40:54.386 --> 40:57.287
      AND WHAT WAS POSSIBLE
        BECAME PROBABLE.
