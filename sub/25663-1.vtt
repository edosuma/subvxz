00:14.248 --> 00:17.249
Dawn, there was a fire.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.120
And you were trapped.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.290
And you died.

00:25.292 --> 00:28.394
These ashes are all
that's left of you.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.164
That's not true.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.266
It is true. You
were burned alive.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.135
- Why are you lying to me?
- I'm not lying.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.842
-I know this must be scary, but

00:37.854 --> 00:39.571
I brought you back. -No, no!

00:39.573 --> 00:42.074
Everything I've done is
because I love you so much!

00:42.076 --> 00:44.243

Hey, D, are you up?

03:21.502 --> 03:24.336
I am now.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.605
I made your favorite.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.907
Oh...

03:28.909 --> 03:32.444
- What did I do to deserve this?
- Just for you being you.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.648
Mmm, so good.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.550
So, there's something
I need to ask you.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.552
- Give me a minute.
- Where are you going?

03:40.554 --> 03:42.454
- I've gotta pee.
- Can't you hold it?

03:42.456 --> 03:44.990
- It's easier to hold a thought.
- Not this one.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.759
I'm coming back, I promise.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.939
Dawn, I...

04:02.243 --> 04:06.311
I know that you
believe in destiny.

08:14.261 --> 08:17.128
That's what's so great
about working with glass.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.964
If you tried a million times,

08:18.966 --> 08:22.234
you could never make two
pieces the exact same.

08:22.236 --> 08:25.070
I was talking about
being married.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.775
OK, buddy.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.586
- Bye. Hey, babe.
- I hope you're hungry

09:14.588 --> 09:16.855
'cause I'm cooking you dinner.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.623
Yeah? What you making?

09:18.625 --> 09:21.093
Your favorite.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.562
- Oh, I love my favorite.
- Well, I love you.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.604
What time you want me home?

09:53.627 --> 09:55.467
Professor Slope?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.331
- Yes.
- You married to a Dawn Slope?

09:59.333 --> 10:01.666
I am.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.337
There's been an accident.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.906
Adam, I am so sorry
for your loss.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.514
- This is it?
- I know.

12:29.516 --> 12:33.985
One minute you're here, and
the next, poof, you're gone.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.854
I meant the food.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.957
You'd think they'd at least
put out some cold cuts.

12:38.959 --> 12:42.393
- Dawn was a vegetarian.
- She wasn't in high school.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.063
You knew her in high school?

12:45.065 --> 12:49.834
We went to prom together. She
was "the one that got away."

12:49.836 --> 12:52.370
I'm her best friend.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.239
I mean, I was.

12:56.343 --> 13:00.111
Just because you can
no longer touch her,

13:00.113 --> 13:04.816
that does not mean you
can no longer feel her.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.455
Poor guy, I know
exactly how he feels.

13:13.059 --> 13:16.227
- I can't believe it.
- I know.

13:16.229 --> 13:21.800
No, everyone consoles the husband,
but nobody thinks to console me?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.964
I don't want the money.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.066
Why not?

15:35.068 --> 15:37.568
You wouldn't understand.

15:37.570 --> 15:41.239
You think if you fill out the form,
it's accepting that she's gone.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.508
It's very common.
You're in denial.

15:43.510 --> 15:48.112
- I'm not in denial. -OK,
we've transitioned to anger.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.048
That's progress.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.319
The problem is growth rate.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.322
Let's say we have a patient
with acute liver failure.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.724
How do we grow a new
fully developed liver

18:13.726 --> 18:15.660
in, I don't know,
three, four months?

18:15.662 --> 18:17.161
Yes?

18:17.163 --> 18:19.243
Infect the tissue
with Werner syndrome.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.700
Emma, is it?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.335
Yes.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.238
Would you still like to
be my lab assistant?

18:27.240 --> 18:29.307
More than anything.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.309
Class dismissed.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.420
We have to shorten
the telomeres.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.156
- Very good. -And then stimulate
the endocrine system.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.814
- Excellent, Emma.
- Then we should

18:46.826 --> 18:48.493
increase the somatotropin level.

18:48.495 --> 18:52.330
While simultaneously manipulating her
thyroid, parathyroid, and ovaries.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.898
Her ovaries?

18:53.900 --> 18:58.769
OK. Before we get started, there's
something you need to know.

18:58.771 --> 19:03.307
The work that we're going to be
doing is, how shall I put this,

19:03.309 --> 19:05.843
ethically ambiguous.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.646
I don't have a
problem with that.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.515
- No?
- On the road to progress.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.351
- Ethics are like broken glass.
- Great.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.186
Let's get to work.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.922
Whoo!

19:25.665 --> 19:27.198
Ha!

19:39.312 --> 19:40.778
Hi.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.287
Professor Slope?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.492
You're not thinking what
I think you're thinking?

19:54.494 --> 19:57.461
My wife died way too soon.

19:57.463 --> 20:02.533
Professor Slope, this isn't
ethically ambiguous.

20:02.535 --> 20:06.370
This is completely unethical,
and absolutely immoral,

20:06.372 --> 20:09.240
and not to mention
totally illegal.

20:11.511 --> 20:15.746
Professor, your
wife, she's gone.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.350
No, not completely.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.686
- Completely.
- Excuse me.

29:39.979 --> 29:42.412
That is amazing!

29:42.414 --> 29:44.014
Thank you.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.016
I'm gonna hang this up, OK?

29:49.355 --> 29:51.388
A masterpiece.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.990
Ready for pancakes?

29:52.992 --> 29:54.458
Yeah.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.093
One...

30:00.466 --> 30:02.566
- Good?
- Mmm.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.535
They're really good.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.205
- Finished?
- Yep.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.940
OK, go brush your teeth.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.303
It just fell out.

30:39.305 --> 30:40.871
It's completely normal.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.507
- No!
- Then go to your room!

31:50.509 --> 31:52.075
Fine.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.446
And don't forget to
brush your teeth!

32:06.959 --> 32:09.493
She's not my wife,
she's my daughter.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.395
Congratulations, Daddy.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.064
- Thank you.
- What do you expect?

32:14.066 --> 32:17.301
You raised her, you fed her, you
taught her everything she knows.

32:17.303 --> 32:22.072
So I'm actually having a
normal, appropriate reaction?

32:22.074 --> 32:27.377
Yeah, to an abnormal,
inappropriate situation.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.619
Thank you.

32:39.325 --> 32:42.025
Don't you think we
should call first?

32:42.027 --> 32:45.028
I think it will all be a
very pleasant surprise.

32:45.030 --> 32:46.997
I think we should call.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.199
If we call, he'll
just say he's fine

34:49.487 --> 34:51.527
Adam?

34:59.198 --> 35:01.098
I know he's here.
His car's here.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.200
I told ya we should have called.

35:03.202 --> 35:06.470
Adam! I'm just gonna
check in the back.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.744
Dawn.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.783
There was a fire.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.354
- And you were trapped.
- That's not true.

35:27.893 --> 35:30.861
Watch out for the camellias.

35:30.863 --> 35:33.130
- Adam!
- No!

35:33.132 --> 35:36.266
Rebecca, what's the matter?

35:36.268 --> 35:39.736
- What's the matter? Honey?
- Please, take me home now!

35:39.738 --> 35:44.441
OK, OK. What happened? Honey?

35:44.443 --> 35:46.743
I know this must be scary,
but I brought you back.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.551
-No! -Everything I've done is

35:48.563 --> 35:50.380
because I love you so much!

35:50.382 --> 35:51.615
Dawn! Dawn!

35:55.721 --> 35:58.155
What do you want me
to do with the soup?

35:58.157 --> 36:01.525
I don't give a goddamn
what you do with the soup!

36:01.527 --> 36:02.926
All right.

36:04.530 --> 36:08.431
- Harold, take me home!
- OK!

36:08.433 --> 36:10.934
Tell me, what happened?

36:21.880 --> 36:25.882
And, Adam, do you take Dawn

36:25.884 --> 36:27.951
to have and to hold,

36:27.953 --> 36:30.854
in sickness and in health,

36:30.856 --> 36:33.790
till death do you part?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.360
I do.

36:37.362 --> 36:40.597
Well, then I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.666
You may kiss the bride.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.434
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:44.436 --> 36:48.371
may I present you Doctor and Mrs.
Slope.

38:56.034 --> 38:59.069
If you and Rebecca raised
her the exact same way,

38:59.071 --> 39:01.571
we can have her back.

39:12.751 --> 39:17.020
And she's a vegetarian,
pancakes are her favorite.

39:17.022 --> 39:21.725
- Are you a vegetarian?
- What difference does that make?

39:21.727 --> 39:23.727
I'm just asking.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.662
Yes.

39:25.664 --> 39:28.798
- Because of her?
- No, it's just easier.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.701
If a guy told me I
couldn't have lobster...

39:31.703 --> 39:34.804
She never said that I couldn't have lob...
Can we get back to work?

39:34.806 --> 39:37.107
Is that what you're
calling this?

39:37.109 --> 39:41.578
Her brain develops at the
same rate as her growth,

39:41.580 --> 39:44.848
so she learns extremely fast,
so it's very important that you

39:44.850 --> 39:47.917
make every experience as
authentic as possible for her.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.686
You want me to raise her?

39:49.688 --> 39:51.588
Well, clearly, I can't do it.

41:53.211 --> 41:58.181
Hmm, I promise, this will
only hurt for a minute.

41:58.183 --> 42:01.684
It won't last forever.

42:01.686 --> 42:02.952
OK.

42:04.823 --> 42:08.958
And why don't we get rid of
that nose ring, too, all right?

42:11.196 --> 42:14.697
- I made you your favorite.
- It's not my favorite.

42:14.699 --> 42:17.200
- Trust me, it's your favorite.
- How do you know?

42:17.202 --> 42:21.170
Because I know you better
than you know yourself.

42:28.613 --> 42:30.280
Eww!

42:40.125 --> 42:44.027
If you don't let her be
herself, she won't be.

42:45.330 --> 42:46.796
Right.

42:48.567 --> 42:49.966
Careful, it's hot.

42:49.968 --> 42:51.234
- OK.
- And dangerous.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.736
- OK. -I don't want it
to blow up in your face.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.306
-OK, I get it. -I would just

42:55.318 --> 42:56.898
hate for you to hurt yourself.

47:04.289 --> 47:08.324
But if this is your idea of a joke, I
swear to God I will rip your dick off.

47:12.096 --> 47:15.164
- This is a baby. -She'll be
fully grown in four months.

47:15.166 --> 47:17.500
I will rip your dick right off.

47:17.502 --> 47:22.338
If you do everything on
this list, it'll be Dawn.

47:22.340 --> 47:25.041
OK, if I do this, you have
to promise me something.

47:25.043 --> 47:27.477
Anything.

47:27.478 --> 47:29.912
When you propose to her, can you
do it like a normal human being?

47:29.914 --> 47:32.215
Take her to a bouncy
house and tell her,

47:32.217 --> 47:35.084
"When I'm with you,
I'm walking on air."

47:35.086 --> 47:37.954
Everything has to
be the exact same.

47:37.956 --> 47:39.355
Or it won't be her.

47:44.195 --> 47:47.430
Well, just so you know, you're
missing something pretty major here.

47:47.432 --> 47:50.066
What?

48:13.491 --> 48:17.126
- Let's get out of here.
- OK.

Of someone in love and

call the cops.

They'll send her to a lab,
they'll run a bunch of tests.

- Is that what you want?
- No.

53:41.485 --> 53:44.820
Do you see how fast she's aging?
She is sick.

53:44.822 --> 53:47.556
- Is it that bad?
- Yeah, it's that bad.

53:47.558 --> 53:49.925

her what you told me?

56:19.143 --> 56:20.876
Is she all right?

56:30.087 --> 56:32.454
I'm sorry for your loss.

56:35.459 --> 56:38.460
- What did you do?
- She was already dead.

56:38.462 --> 56:42.765
No, she wasn't. You're
losing control.

56:42.767 --> 56:44.666
You said there couldn't
be more than one.

56:44.668 --> 56:47.102
- So you killed her?
- What was I supposed to do?

56:47.104 --> 56:49.104
- Just...
- Let her go?

56:49.106 --> 56:51.774
This is insanity.

56:51.776 --> 56:55.811
Look at you, you're doing the same
thing over and over and over!

56:55.813 --> 56:59.848
No, I'm not, I am changing her
environment; it's different every time.

56:59.850 --> 57:03.619
Genetics are the control.
Upbringing is the variable.

57:03.621 --> 57:06.121
You could do this
a million times

57:06.123 --> 57:09.158
and it's not gonna
bring her back.

57:09.160 --> 57:13.629
Your wife... she's gone.

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:20.082
Nothing.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:53.849
So even at the peak of the
Underground Railroad,

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:57.853
less than a thousand slaves
were able to escape per year.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:06.228
It's all right.

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.330
- Ohh!
- Shhh!

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:11.400
Shhh!

01:01:15.406 --> 01:01:18.240
Just let me know if you
see anyone that you want.

01:05:29.993 --> 01:05:35.163
Mr. Trout, do you
believe in ghosts?

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:39.935
- Why do you ask? -Well, I could
have sworn that I saw her,

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:44.339
when we were there, at their
house, in the window.

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.942
Is that right?

01:05:46.944 --> 01:05:51.046
Her spirit, I'm afraid
that it's trapped there.

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:58.353
- You sick son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry.

01:05:58.355 --> 01:06:01.456
- I want to see her.
- Please.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:04.359
Please, Dawn is in heaven.

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:09.497
Whatever he's made will
not be your daughter.

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:12.000
- Where is she?
- She's gone.

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:14.269
- Gone?
- It didn't work.

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:16.338
So, go do it again.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.541
I tried, over and
over and over again.

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:22.477
- Oh, God.
- Every time, she came back

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.839
a completely different human being:
depressed, angry, spoiled, scared.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.747
D.

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:16.350
You passed.

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:39.240
We're done with your
genetics lesson.

01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:42.476
Now... it's time for
a little biology.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:04.091
Oh, pick it up.

01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:05.326
- Hmm.
- Pick it up.

01:21:05.328 --> 01:21:06.627
- Hmm-mm.
- Pick it up.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:08.896
Pick it up, pick it up...

01:21:08.898 --> 01:21:10.397
What?

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:13.901
Hi. It worked.

01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:18.339
- She's the exact same.
- Congratulations.

01:21:18.341 --> 01:21:24.078
- But... she doesn't love me.
- Must be really hard for you.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.248
Well, what can you do?

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:32.987
But the reason I called is I'm
ready to get back to work.

01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:34.388
Uh-uh...

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:37.658
real, actual work.

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:40.327
Good for you.

01:21:40.329 --> 01:21:42.463
I sure could use your help.

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:44.131
I can't.

01:21:47.937 --> 01:21:50.404
I'm working on my thesis.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:53.040
Your thes...

01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:54.475
Emma?

01:21:54.477 --> 01:21:55.676
Now, where were we?

01:21:55.678 --> 01:21:59.046
Here. We were right
here the whole time.

01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:00.648
Mm-hmm.

01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:36.216
Hey!

01:22:37.553 --> 01:22:39.720
Stop beating yourself up!

01:22:39.722 --> 01:22:45.092
Whatever happened to, you could only
have one version of the same person?

01:22:45.094 --> 01:22:47.661
I never had the first one.

01:22:50.366 --> 01:22:52.266
