<i>The first day of school...</i>

00:05.934 --> 00:08.169
<i>a day filled with unbridled optimism</i>

00:08.266 --> 00:09.375
<i>for the year ahead.</i>

00:09.528 --> 00:12.095
Aah! It's the first day
of school! I'm so excited!

00:12.183 --> 00:15.516
<i>Then again, that describes</i>
<i>just about every day for Sue.</i>

00:15.698 --> 00:17.289
Braided my hair.

00:19.334 --> 00:22.617
My nose stopped bleeding!
I'm so excited!

00:22.989 --> 00:24.065
Finished my apple.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.400
I'm so excited.

00:26.492 --> 00:28.923
This is going to be
the best year ever,

00:29.030 --> 00:30.502
because now that I'm a soph...

00:30.589 --> 00:31.829
that's short for "sophomore"...

00:31.835 --> 00:33.971
I get to be a mentor
to an incoming freshman.

00:34.088 --> 00:35.503
It's an amazing program.

00:35.609 --> 00:37.889
It really keeps newbies
from falling through the cracks.

00:37.890 --> 00:40.678
Sue, nobody cares about your
stupid suck-more activities.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.763
This year is all about the seniors.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.197
Seniors rule!

00:44.286 --> 00:45.686
Is he gonna be doing that all year?

00:45.730 --> 00:47.941
Well, anybody wants a ride, let's go.

00:47.942 --> 00:49.702
Don't forget...
I'm working a double shift,

00:49.703 --> 00:51.023
so you're on your own for dinner.

00:51.116 --> 00:52.116
And if you can get to it,

00:52.117 --> 00:54.606
there's old Thanksgiving turkey
in the back of the freezer.

00:54.710 --> 00:55.710
Hey, Brick, after school,

00:55.711 --> 00:57.431
you're coming to
my softball game with me.

00:57.502 --> 01:00.170
Softball game? Why don't you
just take me to the beach?

01:05.789 --> 01:07.024
Hi. I'm looking for...

01:07.115 --> 01:08.070
Sue Heck?

01:08.174 --> 01:10.314
Well, look no further,
'cause you found her.

01:10.423 --> 01:11.386
I'm your mentor!

01:11.527 --> 01:13.430
- Aah!
- Hey.

01:13.599 --> 01:15.005
Great to meet you.

01:15.132 --> 01:15.916
Jenna Taylor.

01:16.011 --> 01:17.103
I know...

01:17.201 --> 01:21.906
Which is why I "Taylor" -made
this binder for you.

01:22.019 --> 01:25.397
"Sue's tips for Sue-cess."

01:25.534 --> 01:26.700
Sit.

01:27.747 --> 01:29.703
This is chockfull of inside scoop

01:29.704 --> 01:31.464
to help you get through
your freshman year.

01:31.603 --> 01:33.926
Notice I did not call it
"frosh" year.

01:34.065 --> 01:37.015
Nobody calls it "frosh."
I learned that one the hard way.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.667
So how about we dive right in?

01:38.919 --> 01:40.097
We have...

01:40.193 --> 01:41.259
Stuff to try out for,

01:41.440 --> 01:43.185
locker room dos and don'ts,

01:43.330 --> 01:46.945
funny things to say when
you fall down the stairs.

01:47.068 --> 01:49.798
Wow. There lot more to try
out for than in middle school.

01:49.914 --> 01:50.908
Pretty exciting.

01:51.012 --> 01:52.984
It's <i>incredibly</i> exciting.

01:53.274 --> 01:54.973
Don't expect to make anything.

01:55.078 --> 01:56.939
As a freshman, that's off the table.

01:57.036 --> 01:59.193
But it's still good to try
so you can, you know,

01:59.359 --> 02:00.573
get your face out there.

02:00.675 --> 02:02.674
And this is for you to keep.

02:02.815 --> 02:03.884
Wow.

02:04.046 --> 02:06.079
Lucky my mom bought me
the big backpack.

02:06.270 --> 02:08.798
Now we should probably talk
at least three times a day.

02:09.387 --> 02:12.177
This is my cell.
If I don't pick up, don't worry.

02:12.283 --> 02:13.753
My battery charger is on the fritz,

02:13.754 --> 02:15.594
and they discontinued it
and the phone, like,

02:15.689 --> 02:16.551
11 years ago.

02:16.664 --> 02:19.127
But if you're ever in a bind
and you can't get ahold of me,

02:19.252 --> 02:23.849
kickinitteenstyle.com
is an <i>excellent</i> resource

02:23.967 --> 02:26.638
for all of kinds of advice.
It's kinda my Bible.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.467
My gosh.
I just realized you must have

02:28.468 --> 02:29.706
a ton of questions for me.

02:29.982 --> 02:31.190
Actually, I do have one.

02:31.347 --> 02:32.158
Bring it.

02:32.267 --> 02:34.438
What time does
the late bus run until?

02:35.136 --> 02:36.477
I do not know that,

02:36.594 --> 02:39.454
<i>but</i> I-I can find out
and get back to you in a jiff.

F.Y.I.,

02:50.840 --> 02:54.196
they mop the cafeteria hallway
every morning around this time.

02:54.585 --> 02:56.454
Can we get an orange cone over here?

02:57.705 --> 03:00.176
<i>While Sue was lying down the rules</i>
<i>of high school survival,</i>

03:00.325 --> 03:03.340
<i>I was all too versed in</i>
<i>the rules of Ehlert survival...</i>

03:03.519 --> 03:05.726
<i>hide the sprinkled doughnuts</i>

03:05.847 --> 03:07.393

<i>out of Ehlert's mouth when he see you</i>

03:10.591 --> 03:12.089
<i>will always be an insult.</i>

03:12.196 --> 03:13.457
Afternoon, Frances.

03:14.780 --> 03:16.030
You look nice today.

03:17.801 --> 03:19.036
Th-thank you?

03:19.149 --> 03:20.544
See you in my office?

03:26.616 --> 03:28.437
Hey, think about sliding next time.

03:28.613 --> 03:29.655
Hey, Mike.

03:29.824 --> 03:32.424
I don't know if you know my son.
Brian, say "hello" to Mr. Heck.

03:32.425 --> 03:34.127
Hi, Mr. Heck.
Nice to meet you.

03:34.234 --> 03:36.314
Nice to meet you, too, Brian.
This is my son Brick.

03:36.315 --> 03:37.834
Brick, say "hello" to the Morrisons.

03:39.763 --> 03:41.723
I said, say "hello" to the Morrisons.

03:41.832 --> 03:42.985
I'm reading.

03:43.805 --> 03:46.671
And I'm waiting for you to
say "hello" to the Morrisons.

03:46.848 --> 03:49.383
Fine. Hello.

03:49.537 --> 03:50.588
Happy?

03:50.703 --> 03:53.022
Whoa. You'd kill me
if I talked to you like that.

03:53.132 --> 03:54.426
You bet I would.

03:54.616 --> 03:56.369
Don't worry.
I'll be killing him later.

04:00.112 --> 04:01.417
Here's the thing, Frances.

04:01.589 --> 04:04.411
The truth is,
you don't look nice today.

04:05.355 --> 04:07.870
And since there's
no real way to say this,

04:07.967 --> 04:09.376
I'm just gonna say it.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.773
I'm gonna have to let you go.

04:12.456 --> 04:15.470
Let me go...
unless I sell more cars?

04:15.620 --> 04:16.834
Let me rephrase that.

04:17.146 --> 04:18.680
I'm letting you go.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.440
Unless I start being more on time?

04:21.524 --> 04:24.138
Frances, don't make this harder
on me than it is.

04:24.292 --> 04:27.320
I just can't afford to carry
this many people

04:27.442 --> 04:28.872
when business is slow.

04:29.005 --> 04:31.095
It's not you.
It's the economy.

04:31.223 --> 04:33.623
Is this because I dozed off
in the back of the minivan?

04:33.624 --> 04:35.360
I'm gettin' that checked out.

04:35.496 --> 04:37.822
It might have something to do
with my iron levels.

04:37.931 --> 04:39.681
I don't want to hear
about any lady parts!

04:39.800 --> 04:43.033
Look, this is all based on seniority.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.769
Don't get me wrong.
You're plenty old.

04:44.889 --> 04:46.947
But you were the last one hired.

04:47.077 --> 04:49.745
Wait. What?

04:49.955 --> 04:51.293
This is real?

04:51.460 --> 04:53.294
You're really firing me?

04:53.415 --> 04:56.372
You can't do that.
My son's going to college.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.447
We just found out Sue's gonna
have a palate expander.

04:59.552 --> 05:00.387
Look, Frances,

05:00.502 --> 05:02.595
if the economy picks up
and things change,

05:02.742 --> 05:06.353
feel free to come back and buy a car.

05:08.963 --> 05:10.843
<i>I just had to get out of there</i>
<i>without crying,</i>

05:10.959 --> 05:13.980
<i>because you don't want to be</i>
<i>the woman who loses it at work.</i>

05:15.130 --> 05:17.416
Well, I know what
you're all thinking...

05:17.546 --> 05:19.968
Frankie get another promotion!
Ha ha ha ha!

05:20.083 --> 05:22.062
N-no. I-I got canned.

05:22.216 --> 05:24.122
But, hey, on the plus side,

05:24.268 --> 05:26.738
I was thinking about knocking
off early anyway. Ha ha ha!

05:30.100 --> 05:32.750
This can't be happening.
It is total bull-roar.

05:32.871 --> 05:35.733
It's okay, Bob.
We'll still see each other.

05:35.842 --> 05:36.964
Okay.

05:40.950 --> 05:43.628
Frankie! I just heard
the news. I can't believe it.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.959
You knew, didn't you?

05:46.068 --> 05:47.108
Weeks ago.

05:47.141 --> 05:49.065
Well...
Doesn't matter, Pete,

05:49.156 --> 05:50.563
'cause I'm gonna be okay.

05:50.936 --> 05:52.366
You know what they say...

05:52.686 --> 05:56.111
when one door closes,
another one opens.

05:58.993 --> 06:00.647
Can somebody open this door for me?

06:01.631 --> 06:03.145
Thanks, Bob.

06:04.251 --> 06:07.094
Well...
This really wasn't

06:07.192 --> 06:09.609
such a horrible place
to come to every day...

06:11.181 --> 06:14.144
and it's because of you guys.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.692
Bye.

06:18.936 --> 06:20.766
Dibs on her desk.

06:21.692 --> 06:22.993
<i>Well, I did it.</i>

06:23.196 --> 06:24.335
<i>It was hard,</i>

06:24.463 --> 06:27.223
<i>but I got out of there</i>
<i>with my head held high.</i>

06:27.550 --> 06:29.869
<i>Frankie, we're gonna miss you.</i>

06:33.339 --> 06:36.533
<i>And you left your purse</i>
<i>on your chair.</i>

06:36.652 --> 06:38.030
Crap.

06:46.683 --> 06:49.627
I don't get it. Fired unless
you sell more cars?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.289
No. <i>Fired.</i>

06:51.417 --> 06:53.343
As in, he's gonna cut back
your hours?

06:53.459 --> 06:55.099
Yes, Mike, he's gonna
cut back my hours.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.684
He's gonna cut back <i>all</i> my hours.

06:56.793 --> 06:58.273
How are you not getting this?

06:58.609 --> 06:59.786
Wow.

07:00.571 --> 07:02.708
So Ehlert really fired you.

07:04.483 --> 07:05.828
Okay.

07:06.696 --> 07:08.498
So you're fired.

07:09.078 --> 07:12.298
We've taken hits before.
We'll get through this.

07:15.849 --> 07:17.117
On the plus side,

07:17.454 --> 07:19.944
I didn't make that much money
to begin with.

07:20.213 --> 07:21.777
No, you did not.

07:25.451 --> 07:27.209
Jenna, there you are.

07:27.339 --> 07:29.547
I have an answer for you
on that late bus question.

07:29.696 --> 07:31.416
I forgot to tell you.
I was looking at

07:31.417 --> 07:33.057
all the different things
to try out for,

07:33.058 --> 07:35.686
and I decided to go
for cheerleading, and...

07:35.875 --> 07:37.337
I made it!

07:37.460 --> 07:38.324
Wow!

07:38.473 --> 07:40.768
Are you <i>sure</i> you made it?

07:40.884 --> 07:42.784
Because sometimes they say
you made it,

07:42.785 --> 07:44.465
and then you tell everyone
the good news,

07:44.591 --> 07:46.710
including your pen pals
in Brazil and Toronto,

07:46.777 --> 07:48.337
but then they call you down
to the gym

07:48.446 --> 07:50.396
to tell you that you <i>didn't</i> make it.

07:50.522 --> 07:52.138
I'm pretty sure I made it.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.724
- They gave me a uniform and everything.
- They did?

07:57.216 --> 07:58.764
My God. Look at that!

07:58.868 --> 08:01.108
You're a cheerleader.
I'm a wrestlerette.

08:01.218 --> 08:03.498
It's funny how they matched us
up so perfectly.

08:03.499 --> 08:05.619
Do you wanna have lunch together
today to celebrate?

08:05.620 --> 08:06.354
- Sure.
- Great.

08:06.483 --> 08:08.243
I'll meet you
in Ms. Spivey's room at 1:00.

08:11.993 --> 08:13.721
Hey.

08:13.822 --> 08:14.844
Hey. How was work?

08:14.955 --> 08:17.031
Not bad.
How was... not working?

08:17.180 --> 08:19.156
Well, I've been doing laundry
for two hours.

08:19.287 --> 08:20.818
Livin' the dream.

08:21.144 --> 08:23.829
Damn it.
I forgot to punish Brick.

08:23.990 --> 08:26.578
He didn't lick another mailbox
again, did he?

08:26.699 --> 08:29.453
No, but after the game
yesterday, he was a real jerk.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.656
I didn't want to make a scene
in front of the guys,

08:31.657 --> 08:32.616
but I was pretty pissed.

08:32.618 --> 08:34.679
Then I had a couple beers
and I forgot about it.

08:34.835 --> 08:36.245
So how's the job search coming?

08:36.426 --> 08:39.432
Well, I spent the whole morning
looking through the want ads,

08:39.544 --> 08:40.904
and it got me to thinking.

08:41.086 --> 08:44.858
Why should I go out
and get another crappy job?

08:45.437 --> 08:47.386
'Cause you lost your old crappy job?

08:47.505 --> 08:48.852
No, I'm serious, Mike.

08:49.038 --> 08:51.585
I mean, I'm sitting there,
and it dawned on me.

08:51.686 --> 08:54.350
I never think long-term
about my life.

08:54.462 --> 08:56.462
I always take the first thing
that comes along...

08:56.463 --> 08:57.666
first job, first house,

08:57.770 --> 08:59.445
first guy that asked me to marry him.

09:00.453 --> 09:02.394
Let's face it, Mike.
We're eeny people.

09:03.369 --> 09:05.836
You know, eeny meeny miny mo.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.582
Just that we never make it
to "mo."

09:07.753 --> 09:08.989
We always stop at "eeny."

09:09.095 --> 09:11.610
Eeny houses, eeny cars, eeny kids.

09:11.735 --> 09:13.850
Don't you ever just wanna
be a "mo" person?

09:13.979 --> 09:16.351
You know, sometimes, if you just
open the paper and point,

09:16.527 --> 09:17.838
you can find a pretty great job.

09:17.954 --> 09:19.368
Eeny thinking!

09:19.633 --> 09:22.140
I don't want to just take
the next random job

09:22.317 --> 09:23.350
like I always do.

09:23.457 --> 09:25.655
I wanna do something
that I'm passionate about.

09:25.793 --> 09:27.964
No. You're not gonna start
beading again, are ya?

09:28.095 --> 09:29.447
No. That was dumb.

09:29.595 --> 09:30.715
Look, I'm just talking about

09:30.785 --> 09:32.963
finding something that I'm good at,

09:33.136 --> 09:35.876
maybe going back to school and...

09:36.022 --> 09:36.953
I don't know.

09:37.081 --> 09:39.534
Learning a skill that people
might wanna pay me for.

09:39.672 --> 09:41.337
You know, I read in "More" magazine

09:41.460 --> 09:44.728
there's lots of people who have
these whole second acts.

09:44.906 --> 09:46.148
How old are these people?

09:46.262 --> 09:48.177
Old, Mike. Like us.

09:48.312 --> 09:50.634
What do you think?
Second act, huh?

09:50.799 --> 09:52.639
If it doesn't work out,
I promise I will take

09:52.640 --> 09:56.201
the next low-paying, demeaning
crap job that comes my way.

09:59.137 --> 10:00.505
Man, I'm beat.

10:01.239 --> 10:03.073
Hey, hold on a sec.
I wanna talk to you.

10:03.190 --> 10:04.552
I got picked on by a third grader,

10:04.634 --> 10:05.714
but when I told my teacher,

10:05.853 --> 10:08.469
he said since I'm in fifth now,
I should just handle it.

10:08.622 --> 10:10.660
So I went back to reason
with the third grader,

10:10.819 --> 10:13.079
and he took my lunch, pushed me down,

10:13.203 --> 10:15.261
and had the rest of
the third graders stand on me.

10:15.951 --> 10:18.216
Sorry. What did you want
to talk to me about again?

10:20.466 --> 10:21.797
I'll, uh, catch you later.

10:25.654 --> 10:27.802
So your dad and I have some news.

10:27.923 --> 10:30.398
Yes! I'm gettin' a new car!
Whoo!

10:30.513 --> 10:31.058
What?

10:31.178 --> 10:32.978
I've totally been eavesdropping
on you guys,

10:32.979 --> 10:35.407
and I overheard mom talking
about a "meeting with Ehlert"

10:35.408 --> 10:36.808
and "it's time
for a fresh start."

10:36.912 --> 10:39.770
And I'm gettin' a new car!
In your faces! Seniors rule!

10:39.903 --> 10:41.350
Continue.

10:41.524 --> 10:42.873
You're not getting a new car.

10:42.997 --> 10:44.379
Your mom lost her job.

10:44.494 --> 10:45.376
You got fired?

10:45.477 --> 10:47.891
- No, I wasn't fired. I was let go.
- No.

10:48.031 --> 10:49.225
Are we gonna lose the house?

10:49.348 --> 10:51.193
I can't go to Hickory Farms.
<i>I can't.</i>

10:51.228 --> 10:54.270
It's Hickory <i>Arms,</i>
and we're not moving anywhere.

10:54.434 --> 10:58.266
We decided that instead of me
getting another random job,

10:59.054 --> 11:02.536
I'm gonna go back to school
and pursue an actual career.

11:02.719 --> 11:04.079
But that means
in the short-term,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.280
we're all gonna have to tighten
our belts around here.

11:06.281 --> 11:08.778
My God. I thought you were
getting me a car.

11:08.888 --> 11:10.728
Now you're saying
we're gonna be even poorer?

11:10.729 --> 11:12.212
I can't believe this!

11:12.331 --> 11:14.261
I was so nice to you guys all summer!

11:14.375 --> 11:16.775
I barely even yelled at you,
and this is how you thank me?!

11:16.841 --> 11:18.121
A teacher at my school got fired

11:18.122 --> 11:20.002
because she had
an inappropriate relationship.

11:20.036 --> 11:21.796
Did you have
an inappropriate relationship?

11:21.880 --> 11:25.225
<i>No.</i> The point is,
your dad and I have decided

11:25.359 --> 11:28.154
that it's not too late for me
to have a second act.

11:28.274 --> 11:29.954
No. Is she gonna start
beading again?

11:29.955 --> 11:31.505
No. Your mom agreed
that was dumb.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.877
It's not dumb.
I love mom's beading.

11:33.988 --> 11:35.274
She made me this necklace.

11:37.307 --> 11:39.239
This is so unfair!

11:39.509 --> 11:40.819
It's my senior year.

11:40.929 --> 11:42.609
How am I supposed to rule
without a car?!

11:42.698 --> 11:44.258
Well, your mom's going
back to school.

11:44.259 --> 11:45.139
If you want a new car,

11:45.140 --> 11:47.020
you'll have to get a second job
to pay for it.

11:47.110 --> 11:49.150
So I'm gonna have two jobs.
She's gonna have none?

11:49.151 --> 11:49.881
You're the mom!

11:50.003 --> 11:52.523
You're the one who's supposed to
be working yourself to death!

11:52.575 --> 11:53.508
Wait.

11:54.691 --> 11:57.171
You guys are messing with me,
right? This is all a big setup.

11:57.176 --> 11:58.677
Is my new car outside the window?

12:00.326 --> 12:02.548
You're not getting a car, you idiot.

12:02.686 --> 12:04.766
We'll be lucky if we don't
have to sell one of ours

12:04.767 --> 12:05.727
to pay for mom's school.

12:05.728 --> 12:07.803
What? I can't believe
you're telling me this!

12:07.916 --> 12:09.224
These are adult problems.

12:09.357 --> 12:11.197
Whatever happened
to protecting our feelings?

12:11.306 --> 12:13.106
Whatever happened to
not upsetting the kids?

12:13.107 --> 12:15.027
We thought you'd be
mature enough to handle it.

12:15.028 --> 12:16.354
Well, I'm not.
So from now on,

12:16.355 --> 12:18.435
don't be sitting us down
and telling us bad things.

12:18.541 --> 12:20.308
We'll just assume
those are happening.

12:20.432 --> 12:23.215
Stop whining, Axl. It's called
being part of a family,

12:23.334 --> 12:25.391
so we're gonna handle this
as a family.

12:25.501 --> 12:26.781
And where the hell did Brick go?

12:26.880 --> 12:29.160
Brick, get back in here!
I still gotta talk to...

12:29.161 --> 12:30.161
this is my gap year fund,

12:30.286 --> 12:31.944
but you can have it if it helps out.

12:32.364 --> 12:33.204
See?

12:33.295 --> 12:34.959
Now this is a good brother.

12:35.090 --> 12:36.423
He's chipping in for my new car.

12:48.106 --> 12:49.325
What's that?

12:49.433 --> 12:50.486
Powdered milk.

12:50.586 --> 12:52.786
It'll last us, like, nine months
and save us a bundle.

12:52.848 --> 12:55.288
Help me unload the car and I'll
scoop you a nice tall glass.

12:55.289 --> 12:56.958
Mom, dad, what would you do

12:56.959 --> 12:59.439
if you knew someone who wanted
to run for something at school

12:59.627 --> 13:01.963
but you <i>know</i> it's a real long shot?

13:02.085 --> 13:03.862
Sue.
What are you trying out for now?

13:03.999 --> 13:06.599
- Well, homecoming court, but...
- You're never gonna make that.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.791
Mike! Don't tell her that.

13:07.934 --> 13:10.279
Why, mom?
You think I <i>could</i> make it?

13:10.418 --> 13:13.497
Well, it sounds like your dad
already said "no," so...

13:13.689 --> 13:15.369
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's not me.

13:15.489 --> 13:17.028
It's my mentee, Jenna.

13:17.182 --> 13:18.876
She's doing really well in school,

13:19.043 --> 13:20.913
but homecoming court
is a whole other thing.

13:21.043 --> 13:23.335
They only pick
the most fabulous girls

13:23.338 --> 13:25.298
with the straightest hair
and the whitest teeth.

13:25.428 --> 13:27.532
It's almost like
it's a popularity contest.

13:27.685 --> 13:30.165
But what do you say to someone
who wants to try for something

13:30.166 --> 13:32.234
that is so far out of their reach?

13:32.521 --> 13:34.067
That's a tough one.

13:34.201 --> 13:38.931
But off the top of my head,
I would look her in the eye

13:39.122 --> 13:42.658
and say, "Sue"...
or whatever her name is...

13:42.824 --> 13:46.087
"I really admire your spirit
and tenacity.

13:46.212 --> 13:49.366
And whatever happens,
I'm here for you."

13:49.499 --> 13:51.467
That is spot-on advice.

13:51.628 --> 13:55.284
You should guest blog
for kickinitteenstyle.com.

13:58.095 --> 13:59.775
Are you sure we didn't just
encourage Sue

13:59.890 --> 14:01.195
to try out for homecoming court?

14:01.306 --> 14:02.455
No, it's not her.

14:02.587 --> 14:04.080
- You sure?
- I mean...

14:04.198 --> 14:06.716
I think so, but I was
kind of half-listening.

14:06.883 --> 14:08.126
- Me, too.
- What?

14:08.251 --> 14:09.474
What?

14:10.353 --> 14:11.289
<i>So the next day,</i>

14:11.416 --> 14:14.434
<i>I was off to enroll at</i>
<i>the Orson Technical Institute,</i>

14:14.577 --> 14:16.346
<i>where second acts are born.</i>

14:16.347 --> 14:18.827
Can we please get rid of this milk?

14:18.828 --> 14:20.068
I feel like I'm drinking chalk.

14:20.187 --> 14:22.187
Did you stir it? I told you,
you have to stir it.

14:22.188 --> 14:24.747
Yeah, I tried.
It just goes back to milk dust.

14:24.869 --> 14:26.396
No, no, <i>while</i> you're drinking it.

14:26.557 --> 14:28.672
Look, here. Yeah.

14:28.812 --> 14:31.314
- Stir and drink. Stir and drink.
- Stir and...

14:31.671 --> 14:33.763
Well, it'll be good on cereal.

14:34.893 --> 14:37.234
It's a commercial
for my school! Turn it up.

14:37.383 --> 14:39.583
<i>Do you dream of a
career in the exciting field</i>

14:39.584 --> 14:40.730
<i>of air conditioning repair</i>

14:40.853 --> 14:43.115
<i>or health information technology?</i>

14:43.270 --> 14:46.363
<i>I did, and now I'm a certified</i>
<i>occupational therapist.</i>

14:46.508 --> 14:47.904
An "-ist"!

14:48.013 --> 14:49.683
I've always wanted to be
an "-ist."

14:49.802 --> 14:51.153
<i>In just a few short months,</i>

14:51.249 --> 14:53.588
<i>I learned the skills I needed</i>
<i>to become a court reporter.</i>

14:53.705 --> 14:55.192
I could be a court reporter.

14:55.369 --> 14:56.853
Whenever I watch those crime shows,

14:56.994 --> 14:59.857
I always know who the criminal
is before they reveal it.

15:00.088 --> 15:02.314
I don't think you'd actually
be solving crimes.

15:02.437 --> 15:03.637
No, no, I'd just be assisting.

15:03.638 --> 15:05.937
But the cops would come
to rely on me for my expertise.

15:06.075 --> 15:07.602
<i>The jobs of tomorrow are here today</i>

15:07.771 --> 15:09.519
<i>in our cutting-edge</i>
<i>computer department.</i>

15:09.717 --> 15:12.428
That might be good.
I'm handy with computers.

15:14.516 --> 15:16.948
Hey! Whenever you try
to watch a video online,

15:17.092 --> 15:17.812
I'm always the one

15:17.813 --> 15:19.653
that shows you how
to make the screen bigger.

15:19.792 --> 15:21.632
- You <i>never</i> know how.
<i>- Thanks, OTI!</i>

15:21.633 --> 15:23.433
I'm not gonna let you step
on my buzz, Mike.

15:23.434 --> 15:24.461
Starting now,

15:24.604 --> 15:27.445
I'm gonna stop dreaming
it and start living it.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.192
You need to settle down

15:32.193 --> 15:34.033
if we're gonna announce
the homecoming court.

15:34.915 --> 15:36.593
I'm not kidding, people.

15:36.775 --> 15:38.369
Fine. I'll wait.

15:38.478 --> 15:40.307
I am so worried for her.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.338
I don't know if I should
go over there or not.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.595
I'm not even talking to my mentee.

15:44.697 --> 15:46.057
I don't want to say what happened,

15:46.058 --> 15:48.378
but there was a gift of a signed
"Jersey Boys" "Playbill"

15:48.379 --> 15:49.881
that was not graciously received.

15:50.004 --> 15:51.617
All right, seriously, people.

15:51.775 --> 15:54.301
Okay, the votes have been tallied,

15:54.495 --> 15:56.945
and your homecoming court is
as follows.

15:57.061 --> 16:00.873
For the seniors,
Caroline Douglas and Axl Heck.

16:01.000 --> 16:01.898
Yes!

16:01.899 --> 16:04.019
- For the juniors...
- Real quick.

16:04.020 --> 16:06.540
You may have heard I totaled
my car in a demolition derby.

16:06.541 --> 16:07.381
Not to worry, ladies.

16:07.515 --> 16:09.355
I will have another sweet
ride by homecoming.

16:09.356 --> 16:11.076
Seniors rule!

16:11.085 --> 16:12.566
Whoo!

16:13.986 --> 16:17.110
Juniors...
Kurt Kellogg, Amy Slaughter.

16:18.865 --> 16:21.836
Sophomores...
Chris Aillo, Courtney Sheehan.

16:23.141 --> 16:25.459
And finally,
for the freshmen class...

16:26.092 --> 16:28.511
Ben Anderson and...

16:28.614 --> 16:30.104
Jenna Taylor!

16:32.648 --> 16:35.126
My <i>God.</i>

16:36.053 --> 16:38.581
We made homecoming court!

16:38.696 --> 16:39.776
Aah!

16:48.078 --> 16:49.582
Brick, I need to talk to you.

16:50.387 --> 16:51.841
<i>Now.</i>

16:52.349 --> 16:53.595
Go.

16:53.710 --> 16:54.510
I wanted you to know

16:54.511 --> 16:56.431
that what you did
at the sub shop the other day

16:56.506 --> 16:57.640
was not okay.

16:57.858 --> 17:00.314
And, uh, I'm not gonna punish
you anymore at this point

17:00.473 --> 17:02.139
'cause time has passed.

17:02.257 --> 17:05.742
But you need to understand that
you were rude and disrespectful.

17:06.248 --> 17:08.042
W-what'd I do again?

17:08.190 --> 17:09.819
You ignored me and the Morrisons.

17:10.085 --> 17:12.807
Okay. But in my defense,
I was at the end of a book.

17:12.925 --> 17:14.263
That doesn't make a difference.

17:14.410 --> 17:16.050
Not to you.
You're not a big reader.

17:16.127 --> 17:17.577
Look, I'm not punishing you,

17:17.689 --> 17:19.685
but you can never
talk to me like that again,

17:19.731 --> 17:21.611
especially in public
with other people around.

17:21.728 --> 17:22.722
It's embarrassing.

17:22.838 --> 17:23.640
Really?

17:23.730 --> 17:25.690
But you guys weren't
embarrassed to be, like, 50

17:25.691 --> 17:27.171
and walk-running
around those bases?

17:27.172 --> 17:28.676
Okay,

17:28.822 --> 17:31.222
I'm trying to let you
off the hook here,

17:31.369 --> 17:33.808
but you need to get that
you did something wrong.

17:33.926 --> 17:35.918
You ignored me
and the Morrisons three times.

17:36.040 --> 17:36.934
N-not three times,

17:36.935 --> 17:38.775
'cause the first time
I didn't even hear you.

17:38.895 --> 17:40.689
<i>Whatever.</i>
You ignored me twice.

17:40.896 --> 17:42.736
So I'm being punished
for ignoring you twice?

17:42.830 --> 17:44.405
I told you, I'm <i>not</i> punishing you.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.440
'Cause I'm just saying,

17:45.441 --> 17:47.961
when you're reading the sports
page, and I try to talk to you,

17:47.962 --> 17:49.762
you tell me I'm being rude
for interrupting.

17:49.763 --> 17:52.003
But when someone interrupts
<i>my</i> reading, I get punished.

17:52.011 --> 17:53.304
I'm not punishing you!

17:53.507 --> 17:55.407
I just need some clarification.

17:55.572 --> 17:57.469
You want some clarification?
Fine.

17:57.595 --> 17:59.779
You're punished. Two weeks!

18:00.216 --> 18:01.516
Two weeks without what?

18:01.623 --> 18:03.226
I'll get back to ya!

18:04.361 --> 18:05.517
Mom!

18:06.027 --> 18:07.140
These chips are stale.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.546
I'm never gonna amount to anything!

18:09.656 --> 18:12.155
I'm a big, fat failure!

18:12.637 --> 18:14.277
You know what?

18:14.278 --> 18:15.149
I like 'em.

18:15.274 --> 18:16.594
I don't know what I was thinking.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.138
I can't go back to school.

18:18.270 --> 18:19.514
I like 'em chewy.

18:19.674 --> 18:21.314
They're like gum.
They're like chip gum.

18:21.439 --> 18:24.084
I went down to Orson Tech,
and I was all excited.

18:24.227 --> 18:27.267
And then the lady started
asking me all these questions.

18:27.390 --> 18:29.405
And I just got so overwhelmed!

18:29.506 --> 18:31.966
Dad? Sue? Brick?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.390
I don't know what I was thinking.

18:33.391 --> 18:34.912
I don't know computers!

18:35.174 --> 18:36.894
I mean, I know how
to make the screen big,

18:36.989 --> 18:38.353
but I can't make it small again!

18:38.443 --> 18:40.278
I just unplug the computer!

18:40.425 --> 18:43.106
And the only reason I can
figure out those crime shows

18:43.235 --> 18:46.317
is because it's always
the big guest star who's guilty.

18:46.433 --> 18:50.533
Of course Jeff Goldblum
strangled the piano tutor! Duh!

18:51.022 --> 18:52.387
But...

18:53.411 --> 18:54.851
You don't need to know all this now.

18:54.852 --> 18:57.165
That's what school's for.
You'll, like, study it.

18:57.556 --> 18:59.821
I haven't studied in 20 years.

18:59.935 --> 19:01.328
I mean, look at this.

19:01.461 --> 19:05.990
Every course requires, like,
tons of reading every night.

19:06.131 --> 19:09.930
And I know this sounds petty,
but the exams are on Tuesday,

19:10.029 --> 19:12.491
and The Bachelor's on Monday night!

19:12.811 --> 19:14.211
Look, it's like you always tell me.

19:15.458 --> 19:19.385
You gotta budget your time,
apply yourself, and focus.

19:19.630 --> 19:20.889
You're young.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.559
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

19:22.667 --> 19:26.209
I don't know why I thought
I could have a second act.

19:26.471 --> 19:29.793
I just have this whole long
crappy first act,

19:29.924 --> 19:32.472
and at the intermission,
nobody <i>cares.</i>

19:32.587 --> 19:34.135
Come on.
You're not that old.

19:34.286 --> 19:36.366
Darrin saw you going to get
the mail the other day.

19:36.433 --> 19:38.768
He said you looked pretty good
for a woman your age.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.935
Really? He said that?

19:41.077 --> 19:44.932
Are you sure? Like,
what were his exact words?

19:45.040 --> 19:46.600
'Cause sometimes you say
a little bit,

19:46.601 --> 19:48.521
but it's not the whole conversation.

19:48.724 --> 19:50.091
Mom, you can do this.

19:50.321 --> 19:52.841
If you look hard enough, you can
find that straight A student.

19:52.873 --> 19:53.820
And when you do,

19:53.821 --> 19:56.301
try to sit right next to them
so you can copy off their test.

19:58.005 --> 20:00.628
I don't know. Maybe I can.

20:00.725 --> 20:02.507
But even if could, like,

20:02.653 --> 20:05.368
how am I gonna study or do homework?

20:05.484 --> 20:08.344
It's not like the laundry's
gonna stop coming.

20:08.550 --> 20:09.931
Mom...

20:10.281 --> 20:12.310
You don't need to do this all alone.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.681
Really?

20:15.946 --> 20:17.023
Yeah.

20:17.626 --> 20:19.026
It's about time dad, Sue, and Brick

20:19.056 --> 20:20.800
started pulling their weight
around here.

20:22.007 --> 20:23.209
Yeah.

20:29.589 --> 20:30.906
Hey, Sue. Wanna sit down?

20:31.013 --> 20:32.167
No, Jenna.

20:32.319 --> 20:34.268
Actually, I just wanted
to let you know

20:34.375 --> 20:36.121
that I think my work here is done.

20:36.256 --> 20:39.387
Under my tutelage, you have
become a cheerleader,

20:39.515 --> 20:41.714
landed a really stunning boyfriend,

20:41.858 --> 20:43.872
and been elected to homecoming court.

20:44.013 --> 20:46.454
But now it is time for you
to fly on your own.

20:46.648 --> 20:48.205
Plus, it's really not cool

20:48.315 --> 20:50.442
for me to be sitting
at the freshmen table.

20:56.682 --> 20:59.343
<i>Everyone needs</i>
<i>someone to watch their back,</i>

20:59.583 --> 21:01.496
<i>whether you're starting</i>
<i>high school...</i>

21:02.654 --> 21:04.880
<i>or the second act of your life.</i>

21:06.838 --> 21:08.466
So how's this thing work again?

21:09.555 --> 21:10.640
Okay.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.244
Well...

21:12.362 --> 21:13.841
First, you put in the detergent.

21:15.047 --> 21:16.167
Like that.

21:16.168 --> 21:16.839
Then...

21:17.169 --> 21:18.742
You get a new piece of duct tape,

21:18.935 --> 21:20.726
put it over the lid,

21:22.052 --> 21:23.211
turn the dial...

21:23.324 --> 21:26.255
oh, and remember,
it's broken, so "hot" is cold.

21:26.393 --> 21:28.143
But "cold" is also cold...

21:28.148 --> 21:29.708
But use hot cold
instead of cold cold,

21:29.808 --> 21:31.593
'cause cold cold uses too much water.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.268
And sometimes it gets
a little wobbly,

21:33.269 --> 21:35.309
and it might get out of balance,
so if you just...

21:35.310 --> 21:36.390
give it a hip check.

21:36.509 --> 21:38.029
Yeah. Go ahead.
