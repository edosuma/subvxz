But these past few weeks

was for this wedding

don't understand.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.442

02:56.509 --> 02:58.945
He wasn't there when
you were growing up,

02:59.012 --> 03:01.981
{\an1}so maybe he just
feel guilty about it.

03:02.048 --> 03:05.018

to do is just

with Ray's mom?

that she's trying to

protect Ray
from everybody.

Protect him from
the world,

03:17.530 --> 03:19.432
including me.

him like...

03:22.569 --> 03:23.736
get a prenup.

{\an1}You guys don't need
prenup.

one to protect myself.

you're not gonna try to

fix your marriage.

even joking, man.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.982
This (bleep) is a problem.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.184
{\an1}I could be at the strip club
with 100 (bleep).

So could I.

15:24.390 --> 15:26.458
Matt, Little D.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.827
I thought the days of
strippers and embarrassing me

15:28.894 --> 15:30.529
in public were long behind us.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.332
I though I was getting
ready to marry a grown man,

Last night, when I left
the bachelor party,

16:10.302 --> 16:12.271
{\an8}I was more mad at
Princess than I've been

16:12.338 --> 16:13.872
{\an8}in a long time.

16:13.939 --> 16:16.909
{\an8}I felt like she didn't trust me
or respect me,

16:16.975 --> 16:19.945
{\an8}and honestly, I felt
like calling the wedding off.

16:21.213 --> 16:22.514
I thought about going
to the strip club.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.616
Yeah, I did,
making it rain.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.752
But instead I went to
my parents' house

16:26.819 --> 16:28.887
and I spent
the whole night thinking,

16:28.954 --> 16:32.424

on what I really wanna do.

16:33.859 --> 16:35.594

{\an4}Let me talk
to her for a minute.

I don't think she wants
to talk to you.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.859
{\an4}What?

17:06.525 --> 17:07.859
Not right now.

talk to him?

last night.

talk to you.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.470

I'm ready to go.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.372
{\an1}Last I heard from you,
you went to the strip club.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.307
{\an1}I-- I did not go
to the strip club.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.308
Well, you didn't
come home.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.609
{\an5}I don't care.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.609
That's not fair.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.444
All right, whatever.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.313
{\an8}Ray thinks he can just embarrass
me in front of

17:28.380 --> 17:31.417
{\an8}everyone at the party,
not come home all night,

17:31.483 --> 17:32.851
{\an8}not call me,

17:32.918 --> 17:34.787
and thinks he just gonna
wake up the next day,

17:34.853 --> 17:36.789
kiss and make up
and we're gonna get married?

17:36.855 --> 17:39.291
No, it does not work
like that.

17:39.358 --> 17:41.293
You can't
walk down the aisle mad.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.362
That's bad luck
off the top.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.763
Then what's the point
of doing it?

17:44.830 --> 17:46.198
That's why you guys
have to clear the air first.

I'm trying to tell Princess
that I got my mind right,

trying to hear it.
