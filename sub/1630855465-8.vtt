[keys cackling]

00:20.937 --> 00:23.106
[babbling]

00:26.067 --> 00:29.362
Crush everything in your path
until you find the Shards!

[Eggforcers chitters]

00:37.954 --> 00:39.998
[thumping]

00:42.584 --> 00:45.336
[Sonic sighs]
Don’t you just hate this part?

00:45.420 --> 00:49.007
The buildup? Shadow and Sonic
versus unbeatable odds,

00:49.090 --> 00:53.178
with the fate of the world at stake.
Like, let’s just get on with it already!

00:53.261 --> 00:55.388
Hey, I’m not gonna be the one
who pulls a hammy.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.514
What about him?

00:57.098 --> 00:59.809
We can’t just leave him alone
with the Prism Shards.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.686
[Sonic] Uh, yes we can.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.647
Seeing as he's the only one who can
put them back together, and,

01:04.731 --> 01:06.858
y’know, fix reality?

01:07.317 --> 01:09.360
You really don’t trust him, do you?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.362
-No.
-Of course you don’t.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.655
You don’t trust anyone.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.658
You wanna stay here and babysit?
Fine. Knock yourself out.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.702
I’m gonna go buy us some time.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.252
[theme music playing]

01:34.219 --> 01:36.554
Well, look who couldn’t resist a team-up.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.849
Hardly. Have you seen what happens
when you go it alone?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.851
You mean landslide victory?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.853
Someone sounds jealous!

01:44.938 --> 01:46.439
[Eggforcers chitters]

02:13.424 --> 02:15.927
Oh, my egg!

02:16.010 --> 02:17.637
There’s two of him now?!

02:17.720 --> 02:18.805
Impossible!

02:18.888 --> 02:20.557
[confused babbling]

02:21.683 --> 02:23.768
After all this dimension-hopping,

02:23.852 --> 02:27.355
-nothing should surprise you.
-So what if there’s two of ‘em?

02:27.438 --> 02:30.024
Two means twice as easy to hit!

02:30.108 --> 02:33.945
No… It means our task just got
far more difficult!

02:35.113 --> 02:38.324
Diverting stored Shard energy
to our Eggforcers.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.661
Let’s see how they do
when our forces are powered up!

02:42.453 --> 02:43.997
[electricity crackling]

02:52.380 --> 02:55.174
-[Eggforcer chitters]
-[Sonic grunts]

02:57.010 --> 03:00.013
He’s down!
Hit ‘em with everything you got!

03:00.096 --> 03:01.848
[maniacal laughing]

03:03.892 --> 03:06.060
Ugh. Probably gonna regret that.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.645
I heart you too, Shadow.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.775
Split up!

03:12.859 --> 03:15.194
[Dr. Don't] I’ll get the new one.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.909
Smile for the ammo, rat.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.703
[grunts]

03:27.749 --> 03:32.754
Pathetic! Let me show you how it’s done
in the real world, boy.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.428
[Dr. Don't] Ugh, fine!

03:40.511 --> 03:42.013
But we get the assist.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.186
Shadow!

03:51.231 --> 03:52.774
Where’d he go?

03:56.110 --> 03:59.530
No… There’s no way
Shadow would go down that easy…

03:59.614 --> 04:03.117
[Tails] As long as I’m around,
you’ll always have a wing-man.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.412
The forest is the most
beautiful place on Earth.

04:21.552 --> 04:22.804
There.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.848
Two more, then home for the last Shard.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.873
[shimmering]

04:53.001 --> 04:54.669
[explosion]

05:01.843 --> 05:03.553
It’s… Home!

05:03.636 --> 05:06.222
The forest is the most beautiful--

05:06.306 --> 05:09.267
Ugh! What’s happening?

05:09.767 --> 05:12.854
Amy. Knuckles. Tails!

05:13.938 --> 05:15.023
Guys!

05:18.901 --> 05:20.278
[explosion]

05:24.449 --> 05:26.743
The forest is the most
beautiful place on Earth!

05:26.826 --> 05:29.871
-As long as I’m around…
-They’re all ghostly again.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.873
The forest is the…

05:31.956 --> 05:34.292
Everything was back. Just for a second.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.378
-[Knuckles] I don't need the details…
-This is gonna work!

05:37.462 --> 05:39.130
Nine? You okay?

05:39.213 --> 05:41.758
Yeah, this is a little trickier
than I thought.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.385
What happened?
Reality was flippin’ out over here!

05:44.469 --> 05:46.554
Like I said, this is a challenge.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.556
You’re gonna have to buy me
some more time.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.016
No problem, buddy!

05:50.683 --> 05:53.269
[furious babbling]

06:06.532 --> 06:07.784
Now your turn!

06:07.867 --> 06:09.702
Gimme that! Behold,

06:09.786 --> 06:11.996
the master marksman!

06:24.967 --> 06:26.552
No!

06:27.512 --> 06:28.513
[Sonic] Woo!

06:30.973 --> 06:32.058
No!

06:45.321 --> 06:47.323
[wincing]

06:49.534 --> 06:52.203
You can have the controls back.

06:52.703 --> 06:53.871
[Sonic] Woo!

06:59.752 --> 07:00.753
[Shadow grunts]

07:01.712 --> 07:03.798
See, I knew Shadow would be fine.

07:10.471 --> 07:13.432
Hey, these things aren’t so tough
when we work together.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.393
[angry babbling]

07:18.020 --> 07:20.314
-[beeping]
-[babbling] You will pay for this!

07:28.698 --> 07:32.326
[Mr. Dr. Eggman] These readings are like
nothing we’ve ever seen!

07:32.410 --> 07:35.037
It’s like they’re connecting the Shards,

07:35.121 --> 07:37.081
and amplifying the power!

07:37.165 --> 07:39.417
All forces, head towards the mountain.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.712
Dr. Deep and Dr. Babble,
here’s a little boost to help you keep

07:42.795 --> 07:45.173
those two weasels off our backs.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.217
[electricity crackling]

07:49.677 --> 07:52.763
Yes! Yes!

07:52.847 --> 07:54.640
Now we’re talking!

07:54.724 --> 07:57.810
[Dr. Babble's battle cry]

08:04.567 --> 08:05.985
[groans]

08:06.068 --> 08:08.946
[grunting]

08:12.742 --> 08:14.494
[angry babbling]

08:21.334 --> 08:22.877
Nine! [grunts]

08:32.762 --> 08:34.847
-[Nine] Sonic!
-Nine! You okay?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.392
No! The Eggforcers
have breached the temple.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.062
Hang on, I’m coming.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.650
Go! Protect the Prism!

08:52.490 --> 08:53.491
[Shadow groans]

08:54.659 --> 08:56.369
[Dr. Deep] Dr. Deep to all forces:

08:56.452 --> 08:58.704
The blue rat is heading
towards the mountain!

08:58.788 --> 09:01.249
Not for long he isn’t.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.677
Ugh… Must I do everything?

09:18.724 --> 09:19.725
[beep]

09:23.145 --> 09:27.775
Woah! [groaning]

09:42.623 --> 09:43.624
You okay?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.167
I’m fine.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.674
You’re nearly done! Nine, I saw it.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.468
Green Hill was back!
So were my friends! Can you--

09:54.552 --> 09:58.806
The Prism is only partially complete.
I need you to buy me more time.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.433
[rumbling]

10:08.024 --> 10:09.358
Nine… we’re losing.

10:09.442 --> 10:13.237
The Chaos Council is using Shard energy
to make themselves tougher than ever.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.239
Maybe I can do the same.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.074
-Uh…
-You said it before,

10:17.158 --> 10:18.451
I’m full of Shard energy.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.286
Just gimme a boost!

10:20.369 --> 10:21.954
[rumbling and cracking]

10:22.038 --> 10:23.998
In theory, it’s possible.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.417
But given the myriad configurations

10:26.500 --> 10:29.754
and the commensurate spectrum
of transmutational possibilities--

10:29.837 --> 10:31.672
Uh. Same stuff less words!

10:31.756 --> 10:34.717
It’s dangerous.
Too little energy, you’ll lose.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.926
Too much--

10:36.010 --> 10:40.097
And I pop like a firework. I get it,
but this is it. It’s the only option.

10:40.181 --> 10:44.143
'Cause unless I can be more,
y’know, me, we lose.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.275
[Dr. Done It] Hurry it up!
Daddy wants his Shards!

10:58.240 --> 10:59.617
Uhh, any time now!

11:00.493 --> 11:03.204
Almost there.
Whatever you do, just don’t move.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.538
Don’t move?!

11:20.554 --> 11:21.931
[Eggforcer chitters]

11:24.934 --> 11:29.980
Whoa. Now this is speed!
Nine, you’ve really outdone yourself.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.824
I should probably check on Shadow.
Great idea!

11:45.246 --> 11:47.206
Ha-ha! Now that’s how it’s done!

11:47.289 --> 11:48.332
Meh. Not bad.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.584
Oh, like you could do better?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.837
[Dr. Done It] Dodge this, marmot.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.672
[maniacal laughter]

11:54.755 --> 11:55.756
Rude.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.895
-[beeping]
-[screaming]

12:11.897 --> 12:13.607
Ha! I knew that would work.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.609
No, you didn’t. Did so!

12:15.693 --> 12:18.362
Whatever. Race you to Shadow?

12:18.446 --> 12:21.532
Way ahead of you-- Me-- Us?!

12:33.210 --> 12:34.378
[Dr. Babble laughs]

12:35.796 --> 12:37.006
[Sonic] Hey, Shadow!

12:38.549 --> 12:40.176
Sorry to keep you waiting!

12:51.520 --> 12:54.607
Ugh. Don’t you know it’s rude to--

12:54.690 --> 12:56.108
Agh!

12:58.569 --> 12:59.570
How--

12:59.653 --> 13:02.031
Got a power-up to save yer butt.
You’re welcome.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.701
[Mr. Dr. Eggman]
There’s still one card to play.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.871
Invoking Operation: Big Boy Pants.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.916
[cannons whirring]

13:15.002 --> 13:16.378
It’s aiming away from us?!

13:16.462 --> 13:18.297
That doesn’t make any sense.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.382
Maybe they know when they’re beat.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.553
These guys? Please. If you believe that
you’re even dumber than you look.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.056
Finally a Sonic I can agree with.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.579
[Mr. Dr. Eggman]
Behold, the pinnacle of all creation!

13:53.123 --> 13:55.167
It’s official. I’ve seen it all.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.635
It’s heading for the Temple.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.600
Hey! Bring it on, big, tall and ugly!

14:13.686 --> 14:14.853
[grunts]

14:14.937 --> 14:16.689
[groaning]

14:26.323 --> 14:27.324
No!

14:28.492 --> 14:30.119
Sonic, don’t!

14:30.202 --> 14:33.455
You can’t save anything
unless you protect the shards!

14:39.295 --> 14:42.506
[Sonic] Why won’t you go down?!

14:44.091 --> 14:46.302
[grunts]

14:47.887 --> 14:49.763
Get to the Shards, now!

14:49.847 --> 14:52.141
[powering up]

14:52.808 --> 14:54.268
[Shadow grunts]

14:54.894 --> 14:57.021
-[groans]
-Shadow!

15:01.150 --> 15:02.318
Nine!

15:06.655 --> 15:08.741
Nine! My power-up, it’s not enough!

15:08.824 --> 15:10.993
-There’s a giant--
-[rumbling]

15:19.835 --> 15:21.754
A prismatic Titan…

15:26.383 --> 15:27.509
How do we beat it?

15:28.135 --> 15:29.678
Uh…

15:29.762 --> 15:33.724
You and the Titan should operate
within the same spectral frequency.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.684
If I offset your frequency--

15:35.768 --> 15:37.811
Nine! What do we do? What do we do?

15:37.895 --> 15:39.605
I don’t know exactly!

15:39.688 --> 15:43.233
But, if you hit him where it hurts,
I think we can make him go boom!

15:43.317 --> 15:46.278
-And if he doesn’t?
-Well, it’s been a slice.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.489
A slice of reality, that is.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.328
[Sonic groans]

15:56.330 --> 15:58.248
Grrr.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.334
[groaning]

16:07.174 --> 16:09.176
[rock music playing]

16:29.530 --> 16:30.739
Now!

16:51.593 --> 16:54.221
[groaning with effort]

16:58.142 --> 17:00.269
[large rumbling]

17:11.280 --> 17:13.032
[rock music continues]

17:28.172 --> 17:29.882
Sonic! You did it!

17:29.965 --> 17:32.551
We did it. Did you complete the Prism?

17:36.472 --> 17:37.973
Then why hasn’t it worked?

17:41.852 --> 17:43.312
I don’t get it.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.022
I thought this would work!

17:45.397 --> 17:47.357
There’s still one Shard missing.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.276
What?

17:49.359 --> 17:51.945
Of course. The last Shard is in the Grim.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.908
Okay…
Probably could’ve mentioned that earlier

17:55.991 --> 17:57.659
and saved us the trip there and back.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.996
And back?
The only reason we’re here at all

18:01.080 --> 18:04.333
is because I needed to use
the Prism’s impression as a blueprint.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.251
To see which pieces went where.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.629
Now that all but the last one is in place,

18:08.712 --> 18:12.382
we can rebuild it to make the grim
into what we’ve always wanted.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.802
Yeah… to rebuild Green Hill.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.180
Green Hill?
We’re not remaking your old world.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.265
We’re building a better one.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.894
The perfect world in Grim.
Our clean slate.

18:23.977 --> 18:28.357
Why does the slate have to be clean?
I liked the old slate! It was our home!

18:28.440 --> 18:31.735
It was never my home. Plus, it’s gone.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.529
I think you can get it back.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.239
You’re wrong about that.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.741
We need to build a new home.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.743
Come on, little buddy--

18:39.827 --> 18:41.620
Stop calling me that!

18:41.703 --> 18:45.040
You just assumed I’d go along
with you no matter what.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.417
Did you even consider what I wanted?!

18:47.501 --> 18:50.170
I assumed that after everything
we’ve been through,

18:50.254 --> 18:52.005
you’d see things the way I do.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.841
Just like the real Tails would.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.467
I am real!

18:58.679 --> 19:00.305
Just not your real friend.

19:02.516 --> 19:06.103
What did you think would happen to me
when you brought your friends back?

19:07.437 --> 19:09.148
We’re all in this together,

19:09.231 --> 19:12.359
and I really think you’d grow
to love them as much as I do!

19:12.442 --> 19:14.486
And that’s exactly your problem!

19:14.945 --> 19:18.991
You just jump into situations
with no idea about the outcome.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.576
Wait!

19:20.659 --> 19:22.578
[explosion]

19:25.497 --> 19:27.791
[groaning]

19:32.963 --> 19:37.509
[coughs] We can make this work Nine.
Trust me!

19:37.593 --> 19:39.219
[scoffs] Trust you?

19:40.512 --> 19:42.639
The only person I can trust is myself.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.031
