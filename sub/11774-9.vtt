00:04.738 --> 00:07.007
( theme music playing )

00:16.184 --> 00:18.186
- ( Julia laughing )
- UH-HUH.

00:18.286 --> 00:21.289
- UNBELIEVABLE, RIGHT?
- IS THIS INSANE?

00:21.389 --> 00:24.792
- LARRY, IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME.
- EXACTLY THE SAME.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.994
- YEAH, CRAZY.
- I MEAN, MY GOSH.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.296
IT'S LIKE GOING
BACK IN TIME

00:28.396 --> 00:31.065
OR NEVER LEAVING
THE PAST OR SOMETHING.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.700
- RIGHT?
- YES.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.068
- IT IS.
- YEAH.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.804
SO YOU AND CHERYL
ARE BACK TOGETHER OR...

00:36.904 --> 00:38.872
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE?

00:38.972 --> 00:41.609
NO NO, IT'S STRICTLY
PROFESSIONAL.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.211
OH, WOW.

00:43.311 --> 00:47.981
I HAD NO, YOU KNOW, IDEA
THAT SHE WAS AN ACTRESS.

00:48.082 --> 00:51.385
- YEAH, SHE ACTS.
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

00:53.221 --> 00:56.023
WHAT HAS SHE DONE?

00:56.124 --> 00:59.760
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.130
- SHE'S DONE SOME STUFF.
I'M NOT SURE--
- OH, REALLY?

01:02.230 --> 01:05.266
YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

01:06.767 --> 01:10.204
- WE SHOULD GET STARTED.
- OKAY, YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

01:12.973 --> 01:16.810
HEY, LARRY.
I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY DAUGHTER, EMMA.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.112
- SAY HI TO LARRY.
- HI, LARRY.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.747
- HI.
- I'M EMMA.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.949
- HI, EMMA.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:22.049 --> 01:25.586
- HOW COME YOU DON'T HAVE
RED HAIR LIKE YOUR MOM?
- MY DADDY'S BLOND.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.388
- DO YOU WANT
TO GIVE HIM A HUG?
- YEAH, SURE.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.523
- SHE'S BEEN DYING
TO MEET YOU.
- OH, WOW, REALLY?

01:29.623 --> 01:31.525
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.094
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT,
OKAY, SWEETIE?

01:34.195 --> 01:35.863
- I'LL SEE YOU IN A MINUTE.
- WHAT A SWEETHEART.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.165
SHE'S GREAT.
THANK YOU.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.866
THAT WAS REALLY
SWEET OF YOU.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.568
- OH, YEAH, SURE.
- OKAY.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.403
WE SHOULD GET THIS THING
GOING SOON, HUH?

01:42.503 --> 01:45.139
I MIGHT BE
A FEW MINUTES LATE
GETTING BACK FROM LUNCH.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.175
I HAVE TO TAKE EMMA
TO THE DOCTOR.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.909
- OH, REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

01:49.009 --> 01:52.380
- IS SHE OKAY?
- YEAH, SHE JUST HAS
A RASH ON HER PUSSY.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.684
I'M GOING TO GET
THE TABLE READ
STARTED, OKAY?

01:56.784 --> 01:59.119
GOOD LUCK.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.290
HEY.
LOOK AT YOU.

02:02.390 --> 02:05.693
THIS IS VERY STRONG.
THIS IS GOOD STUFF.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.095
- OH, YEAH.
YOU LIKE IT?
- YOU DONE VERY GOOD.

02:08.196 --> 02:11.064
- I'M THRILLED, THRILLED.
- AND THE STUFF WITH--

02:11.165 --> 02:12.866
- WHAT ARE YOU
CALLING HER, CHERYL?
- NO.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.035
- IS THAT THE CHARACTER'S
NAME, CHERYL?
- NO, AMANDA.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.804
- OH, AMANDA.
- YEAH.

02:16.904 --> 02:20.974
I GOT CONFUSED
BECAUSE ON THE CHAIR
IT SAYS "CHERYL DAVID."

02:21.074 --> 02:23.411
YEAH, WELL, IT SAYS
"JASON ALEXANDER,"

02:23.511 --> 02:25.112
IT DOESN'T SAY
"GEORGE COSTANZA."

02:25.213 --> 02:27.147
I UNDERSTAND, YEAH.
I'M JUST SURPRISED.

02:27.248 --> 02:31.084
I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T
REALIZE CHERYL WAS--
WAS GONNA DO THE ROLE.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.554
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
SHE AUDITIONED.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.223
- DID SHE REALLY?
- YES, SHE DID.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.758
- I WISH I HAD SEEN THAT.
- AND SHE WAS THE BEST.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.092
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.829
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
WHO WAS THE NEXT BEST?

02:43.030 --> 02:44.932
- DON'T KNOW.
- REALLY?

02:45.032 --> 02:47.835
- DON'T REMEMBER.
- I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
TO STAY IN DIALOGUE ON THAT.

02:47.935 --> 02:51.272
I WOULD HAVE STAYED
IN DIALOGUE HAD YOU
CALLED ME TO DIALOGUE.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.675
- I WAS SUPPOSED TO?
- I WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL?

02:54.775 --> 02:56.910
WELL, IT'S YOUR--
YOU'RE THE EXECUTIVE
PRODUCER.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.213
- I MEAN, I'M JUST THE--
- I'M THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER--

02:59.313 --> 03:01.382
- I'M JUST A MINION.
- RIGHT, AND GENERALLY,

03:01.482 --> 03:05.152
THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
DOESN'T CALL THE "MINION."

03:05.253 --> 03:07.721
THE MINION WOULD CALL
THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.457
- I MADE A MISTAKE.
- YOU REVERSED IT.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.426
- I DID.
LOOK WHAT I DID.
- LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.095
WELL, FORTUNATELY,
IT ALL WORKED OUT
FOR THE BEST.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.231
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.100
- ALL RIGHT.
- LET'S-- LET'S
LIGHT THIS ROCKET.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.336
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S SEND IT UP.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.372
OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
DO YOU HAVE A PEN
OR A PENCIL?

03:24.472 --> 03:27.040
I WANT TO JUST TAKE
A FEW NOTES DURING.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.809
- YEAH.
- OOH, VERY NICE.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.344
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT YOU.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.913
- YOU RETURN IT.
- NO, I'M GOING
TO KEEP IT.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.215
OF COURSE I'M GOING
TO RETURN IT.

03:35.316 --> 03:38.118
- GOD.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.388
WELL, I JUST GOT
A CALL FROM MY DOCTOR

03:40.488 --> 03:42.990
AND HE THINKS
THAT I MIGHT HAVE
GROAT'S DISEASE.

03:43.090 --> 03:47.160
SO I DON'T KNOW
HOW I CAN BE FUNNY.

03:47.261 --> 03:51.599
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:51.699 --> 03:54.101
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
HONEST TO GOD.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.836
I KNOW THIS ACCOUNTANT
DANNY DUBERSTEIN.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.238
HE HAD GROAT'S DISEASE
AND HE'S COMPLETELY FINE.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.207
- YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THIS?
- I'M NOT JUST--

04:00.308 --> 04:02.075
- 'CAUSE I DON'T--
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.477
I'LL HAVE HIM
CALL YOU ABOUT THAT.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.646
- IT'S HARD TO CONCENTRATE.
- I UNDERSTAND.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.515
LISTEN, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE FINE.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.050
- I'LL HAVE
DUBERSTEIN CALL YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.719
- OKAY?
- GOOD, ALL RIGHT.

04:21.362 --> 04:24.064
LD, BIG DAY.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.566
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

04:25.666 --> 04:27.601
- I'M HERE FOR SUPPORT.
- I DON'T NEED SUPPORT.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.937
THIS IS-- IT'S NOT
A SOCIAL EVENT,
THIS THING.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.039
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T
JUST SHOW UP LIKE THAT.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.441
WHAT ARE YOU
SO UPSET ABOUT?

04:33.541 --> 04:36.377
YOU'RE NOT A--
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO BE HERE.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.046
THE ONLY PEOPLE
FROM THE SHOW ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.782
YOU KNOW,
IF JERRY SEES YOU,
HE'S GOING TO THROW YOU--

04:41.882 --> 04:43.651
YOU KNOW,
HE'S NOT GOING
TO WANT YOU HERE.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.420
- WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM?
- I DON'T NEED TO ASK HIM.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.056
ASK HIM.
IF HE TELLS ME
TO GO, I'LL GO.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.429
- HEY.
- UM...

04:55.529 --> 04:57.631
THIS FRIEND OF MINE
SHOWED UP.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.501
I DIDN'T INVITE HIM.
I JUST-- HE SHOULDN'T
BE HERE.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.936
- I DON'T CARE.
DOESN'T BOTHER ME.
- BUT HE'S NOT SUPP--

05:03.036 --> 05:04.972
WE DON'T
LET OUTSIDERS IN
FOR A READ-THROUGH.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.474
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.509
HE'S A FRIEND
OF YOURS, RIGHT?

05:08.609 --> 05:10.243
- WELL, YEAH.
- YEAH, SO?

05:10.344 --> 05:12.546
BUT I DIDN'T INVITE HIM
AND WE HAVE A POLICY.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.548
- WHAT KIND OF POLICY?
- YEAH, WE HAVE A POLICY.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.417
- I NEVER SAW A POLICY.
- IT'S AN UNWRITTEN POLICY.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.218
- OH, THE UNWRITTEN POLICY.
- YEAH.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.654
- I DON'T WANT TO
STAND IN THE WAY.
- NO, STAND IN THE WAY.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.756
- I WANT YOU TO
STAND IN THE WAY.
- NO, I COULDN'T.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.592
- STAND IN THE WAY.
- I WOULD FEEL HORRIBLE.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.827
NO, DON'T.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.963
- JERRY, MARTY FUNKHOUSER.
- HEY, MARTY. HOW YOU DOING?

05:30.063 --> 05:31.465
- HOW YOU DOING?
- GOOD.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.000
- WANT TO HEAR A JOKE?
- NO, NOT REALLY.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.702
HE DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR.
WE HAVE A READ-THROUGH.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.704
- YEAH--
- LET ME JUST GET
RIGHT THROUGH IT.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.573
- OKAY.
- A WOMAN IS VERY AFRAID
OF THE SIZE OF HER OPENING.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.942
- WHAT IS SHE AFRAID OF?
- THE SIZE OF HER OPENING.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.677
SO SHE GOES
TO HER MOTHER.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.846
SHE SAYS,
"WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
I'M SO BIG DOWN THERE.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.915
WHEN I MARRY HARRY,
HE'S GOING TO DIVORCE ME."

05:48.015 --> 05:50.518
HER MOTHER SAYS,
"DON'T WORRY, SWEETHEART,
IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.219
DO WHAT I DID
WHEN I MARRIED
YOUR FATHER.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.388
GO TO THE MARKET,
GET SOME RAW LIVER,
PUT IT IN THERE.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.623
HE'LL NEVER KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE."

05:55.723 --> 05:57.458
- OH MY GOD.
- SO SHE DOES.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.360
THEY HAVE
EIGHT HOURS OF SEX
AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.363
SHE WAKES UP AT 10:00.
HE'S GONE, BUT THERE'S
A NOTE ON HER PILLOW.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.132
IT SAYS,
"MY DARLING HARRIET,

06:05.232 --> 06:07.801
TO THINK THAT I WAITED
A YEAR TO CONSUMMATE
OUR RELATIONSHIP

06:07.901 --> 06:10.270
MAKES MY HEART BEAT
SO LOUDLY I'M SURPRISED
IT DIDN'T WAKE YOU UP.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.305
THE ONLY REASON
I'M NOT HERE NOW,
DARLING,

06:12.406 --> 06:13.807
IS I'M AT WORK
TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY

06:13.907 --> 06:15.609
TO BUY YOU A HOUSE,
A PICKET FENCE.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.310
WE'LL HAVE DOGS
AND CHILDREN."

06:17.411 --> 06:18.846
- THIS IS NOT SO BAD.
- YEAH, THIS IS GREAT.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.414
WILL YOU FINISH
THE FUCKING JOKE
ALREADY?

06:20.514 --> 06:22.249
"WHEN THE 5:00
DINNER BELL RINGS,

06:22.349 --> 06:24.685
I WILL BE HOME LIKE
THE WINGED GOSSAMER
OF LOVE IN YOUR ARMS.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.554
YOUR LOVING HUSBAND,
HARRY."

06:26.654 --> 06:30.691
- AW, THAT'S NICE.
- "P.S., YOUR CUNT
IS IN THE SINK."

06:32.292 --> 06:34.662
Larry:
YOU TOLD YOUR JOKE.
LET'S GO.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.697
- Marty: HOW GOOD IS THAT?
- IT SURPRISED ME.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.999
- IT'S GREAT.
- I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD
BE THAT REVOLTING.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.401
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE HOLD THE WORK.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.070
LET'S TAKE OUR PLACES
FOR THE TABLE READ.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.606
OKAY, LET'S SIT
AT THE TABLE.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.140
GO SIT IN
THE BLEACHERS.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.177
- GREAT MEETING YOU.
- YEAH, NICE MEETING YOU TOO.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.746
- BIG FAN.
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.915
I LIKE THAT GUY.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.150
HE'S CRAZY.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.687
HEY.

06:59.787 --> 07:00.921
- I'M SO NERVOUS.
- WHAT?

07:01.021 --> 07:02.890
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE GREAT.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.191
IT'S NOTHING.
COME ON.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.826
LOOK HOW MANY
PEOPLE ARE HERE.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.561
JUST-- JUST DO IT.
YOU GOT IT.

07:07.661 --> 07:11.098
- Cheryl: OKAY.
- ( Jerry laughs )

07:11.198 --> 07:12.399
OKAY, FOLKS,
PLEASE SETTLE IN.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.268
WE'RE LOOKING AT
"SEINFELD: THE REUNION,"

07:15.368 --> 07:17.538
WRITTEN BY LARRY DAVID
AND JERRY SEINFELD.

07:17.638 --> 07:21.742
Larry:
YEAH, GIVE IT UP.

07:21.842 --> 07:25.613
SCENE A OPENS
IN JERRY'S APARTMENT.
JERRY AND GEORGE.

07:25.713 --> 07:28.482
- IT'S UNWRITTEN
ETIQUETTE, GEORGE.
- WHO SAYS SO?

07:28.582 --> 07:30.183
NO ONE KNOWS.
THAT'S WHY IT'S UNWRITTEN.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.986
YOU DON'T BLOW YOUR NOSE
IN A CLOTH NAPKIN
IN A RESTAURANT.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.622
WHY?
THEY WASH IT.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.824
IT'S JUST NOT DONE
IN POLITE SOCIETY.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.959
IT'S NOT DONE
IN IMPOLITE SOCIETY.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.762
- EVEN THE IMPOLITE
DON'T DO IT.
- ( LAUGHTER )

07:41.862 --> 07:44.331
- THE OTHER DAY
YOU SNEEZED IN A NAPKIN.
- THAT'S DIFFERENT.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.466
- WHY?
- A SNEEZE IS INVOLUNTARY.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.169
YOU HAVE 2.5 SECONDS
BEFORE THE BOMB GOES OFF.

07:49.269 --> 07:52.239
Jason:
WELL, I LIVE BY MY RULES,
NOT YOUR RULES.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.708
- YOU WOULD DO THIS
IN FRONT OF YOUR WIFE?
- ALL THE TIME.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.209
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHY SHE LEFT YOU.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.444
- ( LAUGHTER )
- Man: BUZZ.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.012
- IT'S ME.
- ( BOTH ) OOP.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.848
Man:
KRAMER ENTERS
HOLDING A NEWSPAPER.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.617
HEY, GEORGE,
DID YOU SEE THIS?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.953
IT'S AN ARTICLE
ABOUT BERNIE MADOFF.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.721
- KRAMER, I--
- NO, LOOK AT THIS.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.691
THEY GOT THE FLOOR PLAN
OF ALL HIS OFFICES.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.726
- HERE'S WHERE HE WAS.
- KRAMER, HE-- HE DOESN'T--

08:12.826 --> 08:14.595
NO, YOU COULDN'T
GET TO HIM.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.229
IT WAS A PONZI SCHEME.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.499
DO I NEED THIS?
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.301
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU LOST
A COUPLE OF MILLION.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.936
IT WAS MORE
THAN A COUPLE.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.205
WELL, IT WAS MORE
THAN A GREAT IDEA.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.208
AN IPHONE APPLICATION
THAT LEADS YOU VIA YOUR GPS

08:28.308 --> 08:30.110
TO THE NEAREST
ACCEPTABLE TOILET

08:30.210 --> 08:32.512
WHEREVER YOU ARE
IN THE WORLD.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.048
THE ITOILET.
AND I THOUGHT OF IT.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.551
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GIVE
THAT CROOK MADOFF
ALL OF IT?

08:37.651 --> 08:40.654
- I DON'T KNOW.
- HOW COULD YOU
BE SO STUPID?!

08:40.754 --> 08:43.557
( JASON CRYING )
ALL OF IT, JERRY.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.159
- ALL OF IT.
- Man: ELAINE ENTERS.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.197
- MADOFF?
- ( LAUGHTER )

08:50.297 --> 08:53.601
SCENE B, WE'RE IN
JERRY'S APARTMENT.
IT'S LATER.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.736
JERRY, ELAINE,
AND KRAMER.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.270
JERR, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND BABYSIT TONIGHT?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.172
Jerry:
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.342
- Michael: HEY,
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ME?
- Julia: UM...

09:02.442 --> 09:04.778
I FIGURED YOU WERE BUSY.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.715
Michael:
NO, I'M GOOD WITH KIDS.
I DON'T CONDESCEND TO THEM.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.583
I GET RIGHT DOWN
TO THEIR LEVEL.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.219
- RIGHT DOWN.
- YOU DON'T SAY.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.021
OH, I DO SAY.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.190
JERRY, HEY, DID YOU GIVE
ISABEL'S DOLL A HAIRCUT?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.827
- THE JUDY DOLL?
- YES, JUDY.

09:19.927 --> 09:23.430
- A LITTLE TRIM.
- WELL, NOW YOU GOT
TO FIND A NEW JUDY.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.165
CHILDREN NEED
CONSISTENCY.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.667
I CAN MAKE
THAT HAPPEN.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.168
I THINK UNCLE JERRY
SHOULD DO IT,

09:28.268 --> 09:30.604
WHICH IS WHAT
SHE'S CALLING YOU,
BY THE WAY.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.973
- I'M NOT SURE HOW
I FEEL ABOUT THAT.
- WHY?

09:33.073 --> 09:36.644
WELL, BECAUSE
I DONATED THE SPERM.

09:36.744 --> 09:40.213
- I OFFERED.
- ( LAUGHTER )

09:42.049 --> 09:43.884
I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT
YOU A NEW HOUSE.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.585
THAT'S EASY
TO SAY NOW

09:45.686 --> 09:47.187
AFTER YOU LOST
EVERYTHING.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.190
- I WAS PLANNING ON IT.
- AH, YOU'RE FULL OF CRAP.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.760
( LAUGHTER )

09:52.860 --> 09:56.329
HEY, JERRY, THIS ECONOMY
IS REALLY HITTING ME.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.398
IT'S ALL DRIED UP
OUT THERE.

09:58.498 --> 10:01.001
IT'S DRY, JERRY,
DRY AS A BONE.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.303
YOU WEREN'T WORKING
IN THE GOOD ECONOMY.

10:03.403 --> 10:07.140
YEAH, I GUESS
THAT'S TRUE.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.810
Man:
OKAY, PLEASE GO TO SCENE H.
IT'S IN THE COFFEE SHOP.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.246
THIS IS DAY 4.
GEORGE, AMANDA.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.749
( STUTTERING )
I'VE BEEN DREADING
HAVING TO...

10:15.849 --> 10:17.584
TELL YOU ABOUT
THE WHOLE MADOFF THING.

10:17.685 --> 10:21.254
- OH, WELL.
- YOU MUST HATE ME FOR
LOSING OUR MONEY LIKE THAT.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.924
WE'RE--
WE'RE WIPED OUT.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.259
ACTUALLY,
I'M FINE, GEORGE.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.731
- FINE?
- YEAH, I TOOK MY HALF
OUT OF MADOFF

10:30.831 --> 10:33.300
RIGHT AFTER
WE GOT DIVORCED.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.870
- YOU WHAT?
- YEAH, I STILL
HAVE MY HALF.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.072
W-WHY DID YOU
TAKE IT OUT?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.041
I BUMPED INTO MADOFF
ON THE STREET ONE DAY

10:41.141 --> 10:43.443
AND HE WAS WEARING
THIS QUILTED JACKET
WITH THE COLLAR UP,

10:43.543 --> 10:46.046
AND FOR SOME REASON
IT CREEPED ME OUT.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.816
SO THE NEXT DAY,
I PULLED ALL MY MONEY OUT.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.918
TURNS OUT I DID
QUITE WELL BY HIM.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.920
COLLAR UP?

10:53.020 --> 10:54.654
CREEPED YOU OUT?
THAT'S MY MONEY!

10:54.755 --> 10:56.289
YOU HAVE MY MONEY!

10:56.389 --> 10:59.492
NOT ACCORDING TO THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

10:59.592 --> 11:03.964
( LAUGHTER )

11:04.064 --> 11:06.867
- Julia: WHAT'S WRONG?
- Jason: WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S WRONG?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.869
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S WRONG.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.738
SHE ASKED ME
TO SIGN A PRENUP.

11:10.838 --> 11:11.972
SO IN CASE
IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,

11:12.072 --> 11:13.874
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO GET TO THE MONEY

11:13.974 --> 11:15.242
THAT WAS YOURS
TO BEGIN WITH?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.677
Michael:
WELL, THAT'S ANOTHER
PONZI SCHEME.

11:17.778 --> 11:21.181
SO, GEORGE,
ARE YOU MARRYING HER
FOR YOUR MONEY?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.116
NO.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.617
NO.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.286
AND IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS, ELAINE.

11:26.386 --> 11:30.057
GEORGE TAKES OUT A NAPKIN
AND BRINGS IT TO HIS NOSE.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.992
- Cast: NO!
- AS THEY REACH FOR GEORGE,

11:32.092 --> 11:34.594
THE SHOT FREEZES
AND WE FADE OUT.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.331
- YAY.
- VERY NICE. NICE!

11:39.532 --> 11:41.001
PLEASE TAKE FIVE.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.070
WE'RE IN JERRY'S
APARTMENT IN FIVE.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.405
- GREAT GREAT.
REALLY GREAT.
- YEAH.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.208
- THE WAY...
- ( JASON LAUGHS )

11:48.308 --> 11:49.943
...IT WAS RIGHT THERE.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.879
- WHAT DID YOU THINK?
- OH, I LOVED IT.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.481
- IT WAS FANTASTIC.
- I'M GLAD YOU WERE
HERE TO SEE IT.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.616
- WELL, HAVE FUN.
I WILL TALK TO YOU LATER.
- OKAY.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.285
- THANK YOU.
- SURE.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.821
SO LET'S GO OVER
SOME STUFF IN THE OFFICE,
A COUPLE LITTLE SPOTS?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.522
- SURE.
- OKAY.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.958
EH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
GREAT.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.827
- REALLY GREAT.
REALLY GREAT.
- REALLY?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.796
YEAH. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, BY THE WAY.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.931
I APPRECIATE
THE LOAN OF YOUR PEN.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.736
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KEEP IT.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.371
I DON'T WANT THE PEN.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.440
YEAH. NO, YOU--
YOU KEEP IT.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.543
I DON'T WANT THE PEN.
I JUST NEEDED TO BORROW IT
FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

12:23.643 --> 12:27.314
- NO, I-I DON'T WANT IT.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PEN?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.316
I WAS WATCHING YOU
DURING THE READ-THROUGH.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.084
THE PEN WAS IN YOUR MOUTH,
THE PEN WAS IN YOUR EAR--

12:31.184 --> 12:33.120
IN MY EAR?
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.754
IT WAS IN EVERY
ORIFICE OF YOUR BODY.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.456
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.826
I HAD THE PEN
UP MY ASS WHILE DOING
THE READ-THROUGH?

12:38.926 --> 12:40.794
- EXCEPT FOR THE ASS.
- IT'S BEEN TAINTED?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.863
- IT'S BEEN TAINTED, EXACTLY.
- I SEE, I SEE.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.898
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
YOU CAN DO.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.366
I'M HERE TO SERVE YOU.
WHAT CAN I DO?

12:46.466 --> 12:48.701
WHY DON'T YOU
GET ME A NEW PEN?
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.270
THAT'S THE FAIR
THING TO DO,

12:50.370 --> 12:53.106
THE NICE THING TO DO,
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.709
- WILL YOU DO THAT FOR ME?
- FOR YOU, ANYTHING.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.379
- THANK YOU.
- MY PLEASURE.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.690
WOW, THIS PLACE
IS PACKED.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.760
- MONSIEUR DAVID!
- HELLO.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.662
- WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

13:15.762 --> 13:19.499
TWO FOR LUNCH? OUI?
JUST FOLLOW ME.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.269
- I HAVE FOR YOU HERE
THE BEST WAITER IN THE HOUSE.
- THANK YOU.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.171
- YOU WILL HAVE
A LOVELY MEAL.
- THANK YOU.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.805
- BON APPÃ©TIT.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.942
- ABSOLUTELY.
- OKAY.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.644
BEST WAITER?
A TABLE RIGHT AWAY?

13:31.744 --> 13:34.147
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.850
- I GREASED HIM.
- HOW MUCH DID YOU GIVE HIM?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.151
- 20 BUCKS.
- 20 BUCKS.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.819
I GIVE IT TO HIM
ALL THE TIME.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.554
- SAME THING EVERY TIME.
- ( CELL PHONE CHIMES )

13:41.654 --> 13:43.390
WHAT'S THIS?

13:43.490 --> 13:47.260
- WELL, THIS IS
KIND OF ODD.
- WHAT?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.963
STACY'S DAUGHTER
JUST SENT ME A TEXT.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.265
"GOT YOUR INFO FROM MY MOM.
NICE MEETING YOU.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.267
DID YOU HAVE FUN
AT THE TABLE READ?"

13:54.367 --> 13:56.469
YOU GOT A NEW
LITTLE PEN PAL.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.705
I GUESS I HAVE TO ANSWER HER.
SHE ASKED ME A QUESTION, RIGHT?

13:58.805 --> 14:00.273
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IT'S A LITTLE KID.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.610
JUST SAY, "HEY,
WENT GREAT, THANKS."

14:03.710 --> 14:06.379
"WENT GREAT, THANKS."

14:06.479 --> 14:08.015
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO--

14:08.115 --> 14:11.885
OH, MICHAEL IS VERY CONCERNED
THAT HE HAS GROAT'S DISEASE.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.921
HE THINKS HE MIGHT
HAVE GROAT'S DISEASE?

14:14.021 --> 14:17.724
YEAH, AND I TOLD HIM
THAT I'D HOOK HIM UP

14:17.824 --> 14:20.727
WITH FUNKHOUSER'S FRIEND
DANNY DUBERSTEIN.

14:20.827 --> 14:25.198
- YEAH, DANNY DUBERSTEIN.
- DO YOU KNOW HOW TO GET
IN TOUCH WITH HIM?

14:25.298 --> 14:26.967
NOBODY CAN GET
IN TOUCH WITH HIM.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.735
HE DIED LIKE
TWO MONTHS AGO.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.904
DUBERSTEIN DIED?

14:31.004 --> 14:33.273
MM-HMM,
OF GROAT'S DISEASE.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.842
JESUS. WHAT THE HELL
AM I GOING TO TELL MICHAEL?

14:35.943 --> 14:37.577
I DON'T KNOW.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.849
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THAT KRAMER THING

14:42.950 --> 14:44.817
WITH THE LATCH FOR
THE TOILET, THE ITOILET?

14:44.918 --> 14:47.654
- WAS THAT FUNNY?
- WELL...

14:49.122 --> 14:50.557
I DON'T REMEMBER
IF THAT WORKED OR NOT.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.659
WHAT ABOUT JULIA
AND THE KID WITH
THE PRESENT?

14:52.759 --> 14:55.262
IT KIND OF WORKED.
NO?

14:55.362 --> 14:56.964
DID YOU HEAR
ANY OF THE JOKES?

14:57.064 --> 15:00.433
WHERE WAS
YOUR MIND AT?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.635
I LOANED JASON MY PEN

15:02.735 --> 15:05.105
AND I GOT
VERY DISTRACTED

15:05.205 --> 15:06.473
BECAUSE HE KEPT
TAKING THE PEN--

15:06.573 --> 15:08.675
FIRST HE WAS SCRATCHING
HIS BACK WITH IT.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.044
SCRATCHING A BACK
IS NO BIG DEAL.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.913
WELL, THEN PUTTING
IT IN HIS MOUTH,
THEN HIS EAR--

15:14.014 --> 15:16.783
- NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT--
- THE WHOLE THING
WAS DISGUSTING.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.286
YOU DON'T LOAN
JASON ANYTHING,

15:19.386 --> 15:21.854
ANYTHING THAT
CAN BE INSERTED.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.656
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY,
BUT I GOT--

15:23.756 --> 15:27.194
I GOT A LITTLE DISTRACTED,
SO I WASN'T ON EVERY JOKE.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.496
YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO KEEP
MY PENS IN A BARBICIDE.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.432
- THAT BLUE LIQUID
THAT THE BARBERS HAVE?
- IN THE BARBER SHOP.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.934
I HAVEN'T REALLY FIGURED OUT
WHAT BARBICIDE WAS.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.005
- THEY KILL THEMSELVES WITH IT.
- IS THAT WHERE THEY CAN'T TAKE
BEING A BARBER ANYMORE...

15:38.105 --> 15:40.773
- ( CELL PHONE CHIMES )
- ...AND THEY JUST DOWN
THAT BLUE LIQUID

15:40.873 --> 15:43.776
AND THAT'S IT,
THEY COMMIT BARBICIDE?

15:43.876 --> 15:45.212
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- WHAT?

15:45.312 --> 15:46.946
STACY'S DAUGHTER EMMA.
DID YOU MEET HER?

15:47.047 --> 15:48.848
YEAH YEAH, THAT CUTE GIRL.
SHE'S SO CUTE.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.519
- SHE'S TEXTING ME NOW.
SHE STARTED TEXTING ME.
- OH, THAT'S CUTE.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.687
- SHE TEXTED ME
YESTERDAY, OKAY?
- AW, SHE LIKES YOU.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.257
COME ON, WHO NEEDS THIS?
SHE'S GETTING ON MY NERVES.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.659
HOW DO I END THIS THING?
THIS IS NEVER GOING TO END.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.395
NO, IT WILL NEVER END.
THAT'S WHY I DON'T HAVE ONE.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.664
ONCE YOU HAVE IT,
THE DOOR'S OPEN.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.633
SOMEBODY KNOCKS ON YOUR DOOR,
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER IT.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.038
- GREAT.
- NOW YOU HAVE A NEW FRIEND,
A NINE-YEAR-OLD FRIEND.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.772
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.642
LARRY-- OH HI, JERRY.
LISTEN, I REALLY THINK
WE'RE GOING TO NEED

16:15.742 --> 16:17.277
A FOURTH CAMERA
FOR THE EXTERIORS.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.179
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.048
- YEAH.
- Stacy: THANK YOU.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.050
OKAY, I'LL GET
RIGHT ON IT.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.818
YOU KNOW,
EMMA'S BEEN TEXTING ME.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.255
- I KNOW!
- SHE'S SO CUTE.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.989
- Stacy: I KNOW, IT'S CUTE!
- SO CUTE, YEAH.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.624
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

16:31.724 --> 16:32.992
WAS THAT HER IDEA,
YOUR IDEA?

16:33.093 --> 16:34.861
YEAH, IT WAS HER IDEA.
I MEAN, YEAH.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.397
THEN YOU GUYS MET
AT THE TABLE READ AND
I GAVE HER YOUR NUMBER--

16:37.497 --> 16:40.567
- YOU GAVE HER THE NUMBER?
- MM-HMM. ( CHUCKLES )

16:40.667 --> 16:43.270
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
A KID AND YOU LIKE CAN
RELATE TO A GROWN-UP,

16:43.370 --> 16:45.705
- IT'S A REALLY EXCITING--
- Stacy: IT'S SUCH A BIG DEAL.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.075
- IT IS CUTE.
- Jerry: SOMEONE
TO COMMUNICATE WITH.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.310
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GIVE HER JERRY'S.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.512
MAYBE IF SHE MEETS JERRY,
BUT SHE REALLY BONDED WITH YOU.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.714
YEAH, SHE SEEMED
TO RESPOND TO YOU.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.183
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.151
- Stacy: YEAH.
- IT JUST TAKES A SECOND.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.953
- HMM.
- COOL. ALL RIGHT.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.889
- Jerry: ALL RIGHT.
- HOW'S HER--

17:02.989 --> 17:04.291
HOW'S HER PUSSY,
BY THE WAY?

17:04.391 --> 17:07.327
Stacy:
IT'S GOOD, ACTUALLY.
IT'S NOT AS ITCHY.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.262
- SO THANK YOU
FOR ASKING.
- OH, COOL.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.264
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING TO GET
ON THE CAMERA THING.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.733
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, LET'S DO
SOME WORK HERE.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.236
LET'S LOOK AT--

17:16.336 --> 17:19.439
OH, FORGOT TO TELL HER
WE CUT THE RESTAURANT SCENE.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.643
- Jerry: ALL RIGHT.
- I'LL FOLLOW YOU.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.812
- OKAY, SO I'LL GO
TO THE FRIDGE ON THIS.
- YEAH YEAH.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.781
- I'M NOT READY, ELAINE.
- COME ON, JERRY, YOU HAVE TO.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.417
WE HAD A DEAL.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.186
WHEN YOU CAME TO ME,
YOU SAID, "I NEED
A DONATION."

17:33.286 --> 17:35.188
AND I GAVE,
AND THAT WAS HARD WORK.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.458
Elaine:
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE,
UNCLE JERRY YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

17:38.558 --> 17:41.528
I JUST THINK IT WOULD
BE NICE IF SHE KNEW
WHO HER FATHER WAS.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.764
CLARK KENT DIDN'T KNOW
WHO HIS FATHER WAS
TILL HE WAS 16

17:44.864 --> 17:46.065
AND HE TURNED OUT
PRETTY GOOD.

17:46.166 --> 17:50.503
JERRY, HIS PLANET
WAS DESTROYED.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.605
I THINK I CONTINUE.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.041
HE WAS FORTUNATE
TO DISCOVER THE CRYSTALS

17:55.142 --> 17:56.609
IN THE FORTRESS
OF SOLITUDE.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.811
ISABEL'S NOT
GOING TO HAVE ANY
OF THOSE CRYSTALS.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.547
YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE CRYSTALS?

18:00.647 --> 18:03.750
- OF COURSE I KNOW
ABOUT THE CRYSTALS.
- ( KNOCKING )

18:03.850 --> 18:06.286
DOOR.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.990
( LARRY LAUGHS )

18:11.090 --> 18:13.726
- HELLO, NEWMAN.
- HELLO, JERRY.

18:13.826 --> 18:18.165
I WONDER IF YOU WOULD
TELL YOUR FRIEND GEORGE

18:18.265 --> 18:20.099
THAT ON MY ROUTE
I HAD OCCASION TO USE

18:20.200 --> 18:23.770
ONE OF HIS
SO-CALLED ITOILETS.

18:23.870 --> 18:27.474
- I FOUND IT ANYTHING
BUT ACCEPTABLE.
- OH, REALLY?

18:27.574 --> 18:30.510
WELL, I'M AFRAID IN THAT
PARTICULAR SCENARIO
MY SYMPATHIES--

18:30.610 --> 18:32.579
( LARRY LAUGHING )

18:35.114 --> 18:37.250
NOW I'M GOING TO CLOSE
THE DOOR ON YOU.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.786
- HOW AM I GOING
TO DO THAT?
- I'LL GET OUT.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.121
( LAUGHTER )

18:42.222 --> 18:44.023
- DO IT. I WANT
TO HEAR THAT LINE.
- OKAY.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.359
- OK--
- I'M WATCHING
THE SHOW FROM HERE.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.628
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WATCH THE SHOW.
WE'LL DO IT FOR YOU, OKAY?

18:48.728 --> 18:51.798
- ACTION.
- Wayne: I FOUND IT
ANYTHING BUT ACCEPTABLE.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.167
OH, REALLY?

18:54.267 --> 18:56.369
WELL, I'M AFRAID IN THAT
PARTICULAR SCENARIO,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.971
MY SYMPATHIES LIE
ONLY WITH THE TOILET.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.408
GOOD DAY.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.445
( KNOCKING )

19:08.915 --> 19:10.883
- ARE YOU KRAMER?
- NO.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.885
OH, HEY,
KRAMER--

19:12.985 --> 19:14.887
- ARE YOU MONENA?
- MM-HMM.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.656
I'M GOING
TO THE BALLGAME.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.892
I TAKE MONENA WITH ME,
I CAN USE THE CARPOOL LANE.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.795
- ( CLICKS TONGUE )
- I SEE.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.331
Michael:
SHOULD SHE COME IN MORE?

19:24.431 --> 19:26.333
WELL, I THINK YOU--
YOU'RE A HOOKER.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.235
YOU SHOULD JUST GO IN
AND MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.303
- OKAY, TAKE CHARGE.
- AND I COULD FOLLOW HER.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.705
- RIGHT, YOU FOLLOW HER IN.
- ARE YOU GOOD?

19:32.805 --> 19:34.607
OKAY, GUYS, TAKE FIVE.
THAT'S A TIGHT FIVE.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.709
WE'RE BACK
IN JERRY'S APARTMENT.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.612
HEY, LARRY, DID YOU
CALL DUBERSTEIN?

19:41.514 --> 19:44.150
OH, UM...

19:44.251 --> 19:45.785
- WELL, I LEFT A MESSAGE...
- YEAH?

19:45.885 --> 19:47.687
...AND, YOU KNOW,

19:47.787 --> 19:49.589
I'M JUST WAITING FOR HIM
TO CALL ME BACK.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.924
HOW LONG AGO DID YOU
LEAVE THE MESSAGE?

19:52.024 --> 19:53.593
- YESTERDAY.
- YESTERDAY?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.328
- YEAH.
- I DON'T WANT TO
PUSH YOU ON THIS,

19:55.428 --> 19:57.129
BUT I CAN HARDLY
THINK OUT HERE.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.065
YOU KNOW
WHAT THE DOCTOR
SAID TO ME?

19:59.165 --> 20:01.167
I'M SUPPOSED TO STAND BY
FOR THE SYMPTOMS.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.736
AM I GOING TO STAND BY
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA
WITH THE SYMPTOMS?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.838
- I UNDERSTAND. I'LL--
- SO YOU GOING TO CALL HIM?

20:05.938 --> 20:06.939
- YES.
- OKAY. HI.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.908
- HEY.
- YEAH, YOU GUYS...

20:09.008 --> 20:12.345
OH, GOOD.
I, UM--

20:12.445 --> 20:14.481
I'M HAVING A BIT
OF A PROBLEM

20:14.581 --> 20:16.949
JUST TRYING
TO FIND A TONE.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.051
THEY HAVE A CADENCE.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.720
LIKE, "YEAH, I STILL
HAVE MY HALF."

20:20.820 --> 20:23.222
YOU DON'T NEED A CADENCE.
JUST BE YOURSELF.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.091
DON'T FEEL
THE SEINFELDIAN PRESSURE.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.693
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SOUND LIKE THEM.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.396
I WANT YOU
TO SOUND LIKE YOU.
I WROTE IT FOR YOU.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.197
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.266
I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE MY ONLY...

20:33.366 --> 20:35.134
- YOU KNOW--
- YEAH.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.504
- --YOU'RE ON MY SIDE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- I AM ON YOUR SIDE.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.071
- GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.
- HI.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.873
- HEY.
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.242
- DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.
- NO, GO AHEAD.
WE'LL TALK LATER.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.712
- HOPE I DIDN'T--
- NO NO, IT'S OKAY.

20:45.812 --> 20:49.181
- OKAY.
GOOD MORNING.
- HEY.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.418
- MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
- WHAT IS THIS?

20:51.518 --> 20:54.521
- A PEN.
- YES, IT IS A PEN.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.423
- YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
- YES, I AM, SIR.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.924
IT'S NOT THE PEN
I GAVE YOU.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.759
THIS IS NOT
REPLACING THE PEN.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.328
THIS IS JUST GIVING ME
ANOTHER PEN.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.829
YOU DIDN'T SAY,
"GET THE SAME PEN."

21:02.929 --> 21:04.497
YOU SAID, "YOU NEED
TO REPLACE THE PEN."

21:04.597 --> 21:08.368
IT'S NOT AN EYE
FOR A LESSER EYE, OKAY?

21:08.468 --> 21:10.069
IT'S AN EYE
FOR AN EYE,

21:10.169 --> 21:11.904
NOT AN EYE THAT
DOESN'T SEE VERY WELL.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.205
USING YOUR METAPHOR,
NO NO.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.575
THEY BOTH SEE
EXACTLY THE SAME.

21:15.675 --> 21:19.612
THAT PEN THAT I HAVE
IN MY POSSESSION

21:19.712 --> 21:22.449
- WRITES IN BLUE INK.
- UH-HUH.

21:22.549 --> 21:25.051
THIS PEN WRITES
IN BLUE INK

21:25.151 --> 21:26.586
EXACTLY THE SAME.
IT'S THE SAME EYE.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.121
THIS PEN IS ALMOST BLIND
COMPARED TO MY PEN.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.358
NO, BELIEVE ME.
IT SEES THE TRUTH.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.725
IT'S NOT THE PEN
I GAVE YOU.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.461
YOU ASKED ME
TO REPLACE THE PEN.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.429
- YOU DIDN'T REPLACE THE PEN.
- I REPLACED IT.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.830
- YOU DIDN'T REPLACE IT.
- YOU GOT A PEN.

21:37.930 --> 21:41.401
- NO REPLACEMENT.
- THAT'S YOUR PEN.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.670
I'M GOING TO GET
A COFFEE.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.373
ANYWAY, I SCREWED
THE WHOLE THING UP.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.274
MICHAEL THINKS THAT
DUBERSTEIN BEAT GROAT'S

21:48.375 --> 21:49.742
AND HE'S EXPECTING
TO MEET HIM,

21:49.842 --> 21:53.346
AND DUBERSTEIN'S DEAD
AND I WAS THINKING...

21:54.581 --> 21:56.349
- FUCKING SAY IT.
- OH, JESUS.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.519
- WHAT THE FUCK
YOU THINKING ABOUT?
- WELL, I HAD AN INSANE IDEA

21:59.619 --> 22:03.155
THAT YOU COULD
PRESENT YOURSELF
AS DUBERSTEIN SOMEHOW

22:03.255 --> 22:05.758
AND GET-- JUST MEET HIM
FOR TWO MINUTES.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.361
AND I'D BE THERE TOO,
SO YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE TO TALK.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.463
WHAT, YOU THINK I CAN'T
DO THIS SHIT, HUH?

22:10.563 --> 22:12.732
I'LL WHITE THAT SHIT UP.
I'LL WHITE THAT WHOLE SHIT UP.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.635
- THAT WHOLE FUCKING SCENE WILL
BE WHITENED THE FUCK UP.
- SERIOUSLY?

22:15.735 --> 22:17.937
YOU'VE SEEN
A FUCKING BLACK DUDE
WHO ACTS FUCKING WHITE.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.673
- HE AROUND TOO MANY FUCKING
WHITE PEOPLE AND SHIT.
- YOU CAN BE THAT GUY?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.375
- I'LL DO THIS SHIT.
- LET ME HEAR IT.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.377
"HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?
I'M DANNY DUBERSTEIN.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.846
I HEARD YOU HAVE
GROAT'S DISEASE."
SEE THAT SHIT?

22:26.946 --> 22:29.148
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE NAME?
DUBERSTEIN?

22:29.248 --> 22:31.384
- IT'S A JEWISH NAME.
- FUCK IT.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.252
- TELL HIM
I'M A ETHIOPIAN JEW.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:33.352 --> 22:34.754
YOU COULD TELL HIM
YOU WERE ADOPTED

22:34.854 --> 22:36.389
BY THE JEWISH FAMILY--
THE DUBERSTEINS.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.224
- I WAS FUCKING ADOPTED--
- YOU GOT BAR MITZVAHED.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.059
"BAR MITZFIT"
AND ALL THAT SHIT, YEAH.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.561
- SAY THAT AGAIN?
- "BAR MITZFIT."

22:41.661 --> 22:44.063
- IT'S NOT "BAR MITZFIT."
- "BAR MITZFIT."

22:44.163 --> 22:45.832
- BAR MITZVAHED.
- "BAR MITZFIT."

22:45.932 --> 22:47.734
"VAHED"!
BAR MITZVAHED.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.602
IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS,
YOU'D BETTER LEARN HOW
TO PRONOUNCE THIS.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.538
- ( CELL PHONE CHIMES )
- "BAR MITZFIT."

22:51.638 --> 22:53.873
- YEAH.
- OH, CHRIST.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.808
ANOTHER TEXT FROM HER.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

22:55.908 --> 22:57.877
I GOT THIS NINE-YEAR-OLD,
AND SHE KEEPS TEXTING ME.

22:57.977 --> 23:01.247
"IS JERRY AS FUNNY
IN REAL LIFE AS ON TV?"
UNBELIEVABLE.

23:01.347 --> 23:05.418
"YES, JERRY
IS VERY FUNNY."

23:05.518 --> 23:07.787
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT NEVER ENDS WITH HER.

23:07.887 --> 23:11.157
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO GET THIS.

23:11.257 --> 23:14.894
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU GOING TO GET THAT?
- OH YEAH, OH YEAH.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.164
MONSIEUR DAVID.
HOW ARE YOU?

23:18.264 --> 23:19.398

23:27.373 --> 23:30.176

- HE TOOK--

23:30.276 --> 23:32.745
HE TOOK MY $20.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

23:32.845 --> 23:34.814
HE TOOK YOUR
FUCKING MONEY
OUT YOUR HAND?

23:34.914 --> 23:37.316
WHAT DID HE THINK?
I WAS TIPPING HIM?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.552
- IS HE INSANE?
- ( CELL PHONE CHIMES )

23:40.820 --> 23:42.755
"DO YOU WATCH 'WIZARDS
OF WAVERLY PLACE'"?

23:42.855 --> 23:45.091
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.

23:45.191 --> 23:50.497
"NO, I DON'T WATCH
'WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE.'"

24:01.474 --> 24:02.875
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT, LARRY?

24:02.975 --> 24:05.177
- WHAT?
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

24:05.277 --> 24:07.647
- WH-WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHY DID YOU YELL AT EMMA?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.716
- YELL? I DIDN'T
YELL AT EMMA.
- YES, YOU DID.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.418
YOU TEXTED HER
WITH ALL CAPS AND A LOT
OF EXCLAMATIONS POINTS.

24:12.519 --> 24:13.986
- NO NO,
THAT'S NOT YELLING.
- YES, IT IS!

24:14.086 --> 24:16.022
NO, I WAS BEING EMPHATIC.
I WASN'T YELLING.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.090
WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?

24:18.190 --> 24:21.961
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE I CAN GET HER
TO STOP TEXTING ME.

24:22.061 --> 24:25.064
LARRY, I NEED YOU
TO MAKE THIS RIGHT, OKAY?

24:25.164 --> 24:27.066
OKAY,
I'LL MAKE IT RIGHT.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.434
- GREAT.
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

I WANT YOU TO BE THERE,
PRETEND LIKE IT WAS
YOUR IDEA, OKAY?

24:33.072 --> 24:35.307

ARE YOU UNHAPPY
WITH THE TABLE?

25:18.450 --> 25:21.487
OKAY, I SEE
YOUR PROBLEM HERE.

25:21.588 --> 25:22.889
YESTERDAY
AT THE NEWSSTAND,

25:22.989 --> 25:25.592
YOU TOOK $20
OUT OF MY HAND.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.426
MAIS NON,
YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.928
- GAVE IT TO YOU?
- OUI.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.930
WHY-- WHY WOULD
I GIVE YOU $20?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.632
I ASSUMED IT
FOR THE OTHER DAY--

25:32.732 --> 25:34.300
THE WONDERFUL SERVICE,
THE DINNER.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.935
I ALREADY PAID YOU
FOR THAT SERVICE.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.737
WELL, WHAT WERE YOU
GIVING IT TO ME FOR?

25:37.837 --> 25:39.739
- I WASN'T GIVING IT TO YOU.
- WHY ELSE WOULD I HAVE IT?

25:39.839 --> 25:41.373
WHAT WAS THE $20
DOING IN MY HAND?

25:41.473 --> 25:44.944
- YOU THINK I WAS
WAITING FOR YOU TO COME?
- I-I HAVE NO IDEA.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.580
BECAUSE I WAS USING IT
TO PAY FOR A MAGAZINE.
CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.816
THAT MONEY THAT YOU
TOOK OUT OF MY HANDS

25:49.916 --> 25:52.318
IS THE MONEY THAT
I WOULD HAVE PUT INTO
YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOW

25:52.418 --> 25:55.121
IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT
YOU TOOK IT, SO LET'S
CONSIDER US EVEN.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.823
I GAVE YOU $20 YESTERDAY
AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING

25:56.923 --> 25:58.691
ANOTHER PENNY

25:58.791 --> 26:01.560
FINE.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.819
THE BAD BAD CAPS.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.889
- YOU DON'T SEEM SORRY.
- WELL, I SAID I WAS SORRY.

26:29.989 --> 26:31.824
JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY IT
DOESN'T MEAN YOU MEAN IT.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.860
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.928
EXCUSE ME, CAN WE
GET SOME MENUS?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.930
LARRY, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY?

26:38.030 --> 26:39.565
- NO.

CAN REMEMBER.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.300

26:43.636 --> 26:46.105
S-SIR?

26:46.205 --> 26:49.008
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE
IGNORING ME ON PURPOSE.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.910
- WELL, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.
- I KNOW WHY.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.511
- REALLY?
- YEAH, I KNOW WHY.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.280
WHY?

26:55.882 --> 26:58.250
EXCUSE ME,

SOME MENUS OVER HERE?

26:58.350 --> 27:00.820
THIS LITTLE GIRL,
SHE'S GOT AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE DOCTOR.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.421
SHE'S GOT A RASH
ON HER PUSSY.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.691
SHE NEEDS TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

27:06.158 --> 27:07.894
( KNOCKING )

27:09.028 --> 27:11.530
OH MY GOD.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.966
IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS.

27:14.066 --> 27:17.136

27:20.006 --> 27:21.240
COME IN, I WANT

27:21.340 --> 27:23.142
IS LARRY HERE YET?
I'M WAITING FOR LARRY.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.311
NO, I GOT TO TALK TO YOU.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

27:25.411 --> 27:28.748
LARRY SAID
HE'D BE HERE AT 2:00.

27:28.848 --> 27:32.084
- STOP LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH.
- NO, I HAVE TO BE
OUT OF HERE BY 2:00.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.453
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT LARRY COULD DO?

27:34.553 --> 27:38.057
SOMETHING THAT
EMMA LIKES? PRESENTS?

27:39.458 --> 27:40.960
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:41.060 --> 27:44.363
I HEARD SOMEBODY
WANTS TO BE A WRITER.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.766
- Stacy: AW, YOU REMEMBERED!
- WHAT DO YOU WRITE WITH?

27:46.866 --> 27:49.135
- A PEN!

27:49.235 --> 27:51.237
SOMEBODY GAVE THIS TO ME,
AND I'M GIVING IT TO YOU.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.439
- Stacy: IT'S A NICE PEN.
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PEN.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.808

27:55.908 --> 27:59.011
- YEAH? OH, YAY!

27:59.111 --> 28:01.413
GIVE HIM A HUG

28:01.513 --> 28:03.816
YAY, LARRY,

28:03.916 --> 28:05.718
- OKAY.

28:05.818 --> 28:09.722
I LOVE IT.
OKAY.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.928
Michael:

28:16.028 --> 28:17.997
- THAT'S A JEWISH NAME, RIGHT?
- YES, IT IS.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.366
I WAS ADOPTED
BY SOME LOVELY JEWS.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.836
- AND YOU WERE BAR MITZVAHED?
- OH, YEAH YEAH.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.972
THE LAST TIME
WAS A FEW MONTHS AGO
IN ATLANTIC CITY.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.540
BUT I THOUGHT YOU ONLY
GOT BAR MITZVAHED ONCE.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.276
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
13 YEARS OLD?

28:30.376 --> 28:32.244
- NO NO NO NO,
YOU MISUNDERSTOOD.
- WHAT?

28:32.344 --> 28:34.814
IT'S ONCE EVERY 13 YEARS,
YOU KNOW.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.382
YOU GOT TO RECHARGE
THE MITZVAH,

28:36.482 --> 28:39.886
SO YOU ALWAYS KEEP YOUR
MITZVAH KIND OF FULL,
AT CAPACITY.

28:39.986 --> 28:42.354
"CAPACITME--"
MITZVAH CAPACITY.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.959
I DON'T KNOW.

28:50.296 --> 28:55.802
WELL, EVERYTHING I ATE
TASTED LIKE PEACHES.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.741
AND I FORGOT
HOW TO MULTIPLY.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.344
I COULD SUBTRACT,
BUT I COULDN'T MULTIPLY.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.148

30:06.672 --> 30:07.940
WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENED?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.608

30:09.708 --> 30:12.678
I WENT IN THAT ROOM

30:12.778 --> 30:14.346
I HAD THAT FUCKING DUDE

30:40.306 --> 30:42.774
AND I THINK
HE TURNED OUT OKAY.

30:42.875 --> 30:46.012
JERRY, HIS PLANET
WAS DESTROYED.

30:46.112 --> 30:48.347

IT'S MY HAT.

31:39.165 --> 31:41.333

31:41.433 --> 31:43.035
YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT
IN THE SCENE.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.237
OH, YES I CAN.
I MUST.

31:45.337 --> 31:49.141
- WHAT'S WITH THE HAT?
WHY'S HE WEARING THAT HAT?

WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HIM?

31:52.544 --> 31:54.713
I TOLD HIM, "YOU TAKE
THAT HAT OFF, YOU WILL DIE."

31:54.813 --> 31:57.783
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

31:57.883 --> 32:01.020
SEE YOU
AT THE HOUSE, MAN.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.222
NOBODY REMEMBERS A GUY
WITH A DINNER ROLL
ON HIS HEAD.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.257
THEY REMEMBER KRAMER
WITH THE HAIR THAT GOES UP.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.959
THIS IS THE LOOK

NO, DON'T "BABY" ME.
DON'T CALM ME DOWN.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.996
I'M SO PISSED OFF,
I COULD PUT THIS HAT
UP YOUR ASS.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.999

- WHAT'S THIS BULLSHIT
WITH THE HAT?

33:21.100 --> 33:23.835
- Leon: PUT THE HAT
BACK ON YOUR HEAD.
- YOU MADE A CHUMP OUT OF ME!

33:23.935 --> 33:26.172
- NO NO NO NO!
- If only there were a--

33:26.272 --> 33:29.175
a horrible name
that I could call you

33:29.275 --> 33:32.478
that would make you
as angry as I am!

33:34.313 --> 33:37.383
Wha--

- YEAH, I CAN
SEE THAT RIGHT THERE.

33:52.464 --> 33:55.000
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW YOU MAY HAVE
GOTTEN THIS RASH?

33:55.101 --> 33:56.902
THE ONLY THING
I CAN THINK OF

33:57.002 --> 33:58.570
IS I'VE BEEN SEEING
THIS NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL,

33:58.670 --> 34:00.972
AND SHE KIND OF HAS
A RASH ON HER PUSSY.

34:01.073 --> 34:04.042

YOU KNOW, I TOOK HER
