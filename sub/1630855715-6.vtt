WEBVTT

00:21.422 --> 00:24.158
*

00:25.993 --> 00:29.330
JEEF:
Cardassian disruptor,
Klingon disruptor,

00:29.363 --> 00:31.332
Romulan disruptor.
why are we throwing out

00:31.365 --> 00:32.665
so many disruptors?

00:32.700 --> 00:34.102
Orders from the Grand Nagus.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.370
No more arms sales.
We're going straight.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.506
But these are worth a fortune.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.607
Rom doesn't care.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.442
He says equality and hospitality

00:41.475 --> 00:43.177
are more profitable
in the long run.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.912
I want to be rich now.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.614
What even is this thing?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.616
Careful!
That's a Genesis Device!

00:48.649 --> 00:50.451
No, it isn't.
It's too small.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.520
It's an updated
portable version.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.622
These are used
to terraform planets.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.490
You could have rearranged
our molecules.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.559
We should rearrange
the captain's molecules

00:58.592 --> 01:00.594
for leaving so much latinum
on the table.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.063
We could buy a ship with this.
Maybe even a fleet.

01:03.097 --> 01:06.267
Gem doesn't care.
He thinks Rom is the next Lonz.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.602
-(alarm blares)
-We're under attack!

01:08.636 --> 01:11.839
(chuckles)
Right on time.

01:17.611 --> 01:20.514
Move us away from that ship.
Full impulse.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.550
But, Captain, they could be
looking to trade.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.586
It's always good business
to know about new customers

01:25.619 --> 01:26.820
before they walk in your door.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.157
Ah, ah.
Rule of acquisition 62:

01:29.190 --> 01:32.025
"The riskier the road,
the greater the profit."

01:32.059 --> 01:33.494
Come on, get on with it.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.763
Jeef, you're up to something.
I can smell it.

01:35.795 --> 01:37.497
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.633
You're only here
as a favor to my cousin.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.002
I never trusted you.
Throw him out the airlock!

01:42.035 --> 01:43.604
They told me
we would make a profit.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.539
GEM:
I knew it!

01:45.573 --> 01:46.907
They're firing at us!

01:48.008 --> 01:50.043
(screaming)

01:53.547 --> 01:55.783
*

02:13.066 --> 02:15.102

02:49.403 --> 02:51.639

03:02.650 --> 03:05.919
FREEMAN:
Captain's log, stardate 58901..

03:05.953 --> 03:09.056
The Cerritos has traveled
to Ferenginar.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.825
The Ferengi leadership is
submitting a formal application

03:11.859 --> 03:14.462
to begin the process
of joining the Federation--

03:14.495 --> 03:17.298
an alliance that could benefit
the entire quadrant.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.000
This may just be a first step,

03:20.033 --> 03:22.936
but it's still
a historic occasion.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.838
I hope you've been practicing
your notarizing.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.275
You are about to witness
the quickest signing

03:27.308 --> 03:28.476
in Starfleet history.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.110
These are the Ferengi, Admiral.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.812
I think we should be
prepared for...

03:31.845 --> 03:33.814
A cakewalk? (scoffs)
We're not dealing with

03:33.847 --> 03:36.149
the old Ferenginar anymore.
Rom and Leeta

03:36.183 --> 03:38.185
have brought
so much progressive change,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.521
it makes Moab IV inside the dome

03:40.554 --> 03:43.324
look like Moab IV
outside the dome.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.259
(laughs)

03:45.293 --> 03:47.828
Well, you-you'd get it
if you'd ever been to Moab IV.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.364
Respectfully, sir,
the tenth rule of acquisition...

03:50.398 --> 03:52.566
Whoever's been attacking ships
across the quadrant

03:52.600 --> 03:54.402
has disrupted
their trade routes.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.537
Rom is desperate
for Federation resources.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.872
This is just an application.
We'll be in and out in no time.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.207
-(door whooshes open)
-(assistant clears throat)

04:00.240 --> 04:01.909
Announcing Grand Nagus Rom

04:01.942 --> 04:03.644
and First Clerk Leeta.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.013
Welcome, Grand Nagus.

04:06.046 --> 04:09.216
I am honored to have you
aboard the Toronto.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.751
The pleasure is ours, Admiral.

04:10.784 --> 04:14.054
We offer you this ceremonial
bust of good fortune.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.122
Oh, thank you.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.491
The likeness
is quite flattering.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.527
We also offer you
the ceremonial invoice

04:19.560 --> 04:21.094
for the bust of good fortune.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.596
How much is... Oh, my.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.997
In the spirit of unity,

04:24.031 --> 04:26.567
we gave you the "friends
and family" discount.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.603
-Um, did you bring any latinum?
-(sighs)

04:30.704 --> 04:32.005
RUTHERFORD:
See here on the stabilizers?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.507
I was thinking
if we repositioned the...

04:33.541 --> 04:34.742
-Matrix?
-We could...

04:34.775 --> 04:36.109
-Beef up the dampeners?
-And...

04:36.143 --> 04:38.278
-Get a .005% smoother ride.
-I was gonna say

04:38.312 --> 04:40.814
win engineering's "most
beefed-up dampener" competition,

04:40.848 --> 04:42.049
but, yeah, that, too.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.352
-(both laughing)
-Mariner, geez.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.286
You've been weathering
that stem bolt for so long,

04:46.320 --> 04:48.722
it probably can't even
self-seal anymore. What's up?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.724
Nothing. I'm doing great.
Uh, Ransom

04:50.758 --> 04:52.526
is supportive of everything
I want to do.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.927
For the first time in years,

04:53.961 --> 04:56.063
I have total autonomy
and zero complaints.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.666
So, why are you sitting here
looking pissed off?

04:58.699 --> 05:00.200
Stop staring at me. Shut up.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.635
Lieutenant junior grades.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.103
Lieutenant juniors grade?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.805
Lieutenants junior grade?
Whatever.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.307
You four just pulled the most
coveted job at Starfleet.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.877
BOTH:
Balancing the positron
compression chamber?!

05:09.910 --> 05:11.945
No.
Travel guide duty!

05:11.979 --> 05:13.313
I thought that was a myth.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.915
What's travel guide duty?

05:14.948 --> 05:17.385
Starfleet has travel guides
for all habitable planets.

05:17.418 --> 05:21.121
The file for Ferenginar hasn't
been updated in years, so...

05:21.154 --> 05:23.757
Starfleet's gonna foot the bill
for us to go to as many bars,

05:23.791 --> 05:25.759
restaurants, bars,
hotels, pubs, bars,

05:25.793 --> 05:27.828
saloons, cantinas and bars
as we want.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.797
Also museums, historical sites,

05:29.830 --> 05:31.832
but, basically, yeah,
it's mostly bars.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.901
Oh. How many places
do people usually review?

05:33.933 --> 05:35.403
I don't know.
Four or five?

05:35.436 --> 05:36.670
Great.
I'm gonna do 40.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.005
I'll pack my schedule so full

05:38.038 --> 05:40.040
that I do everything
and enjoy nothing.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.609
It's not a contest, Lieutenant.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.909
-You can take your...
-Sir,

05:42.943 --> 05:44.211
I'm only a lieutenant
junior grade.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.746
I have everything to prove.
(gasps)

05:45.779 --> 05:47.415
I need to make an itinerary!

05:47.448 --> 05:49.016
(whimpering)

05:49.049 --> 05:50.350
Does he drink a lot of coffee?

05:50.384 --> 05:51.485
-Oh, yeah.
-Mm-hmm, tons.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.853
We also need someone to act

05:52.886 --> 05:54.455
as a couple.
And since the Cerritos is

05:54.488 --> 05:56.857
statistically the horniest
and least romantically committed

05:56.890 --> 05:59.593
crew in Starfleet, we have
no married officers aboard.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.329
You want us to pretend
to be married and review stuff?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.231
-Oh, that sounds hilarious.
-(giggles)

06:04.264 --> 06:06.299
Yeah, we're already such a good
team, we finish each other's...

06:06.333 --> 06:08.469
-Diophantine equations.
-(laughing)

06:09.269 --> 06:11.439
Maybe I should have
Honus and Nurse Westlake

06:11.472 --> 06:12.773
take a crack at it.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.742
Commander, we are
an expert science team.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.010
I'm pretty sure
we can handle a fake romance.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.480
-Let's go get packed, honey.
-(snorts)

06:19.513 --> 06:21.882
(laughing)

06:21.915 --> 06:23.150
You pulled some strings
to get us assigned

06:23.183 --> 06:24.585
to travel guide duty,
didn't you?

06:24.618 --> 06:25.919
I might have had
something to do with it.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.855
Ugh, why is it so weird
when you're nice?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.690
Because I'm also so handsome.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.358
Total package.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.793
(grumbles)

06:37.297 --> 06:38.131
Wow.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.300
-(giggles)
-(exclaims)

06:50.978 --> 06:53.681
Wow. Oh, it's like
what heaven would look like

06:53.714 --> 06:55.382
if God was stupid.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.217
Oh, I'm just
so excited to haggle at

06:57.250 --> 06:58.786
the Museum of Gambling.
(gasps)

06:58.819 --> 07:00.387
Oh, and gamble
at the Museum of Haggling!

07:00.420 --> 07:03.056
Let's go find the
honeymoon suite, pudding bear.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.692
Right this way, muffin skunk.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.793
-(laughing)
-Excellent cutesy speak.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.628
Yeah, just nice and natural

07:07.661 --> 07:08.762
and definitely
the way people talk.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.163
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:10.197 --> 07:11.632
I promised a friend
I'd meet up with him.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.166
And I have to squeeze

07:13.200 --> 07:15.068
an unforgiving amount
of experiences into my day.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.471
-We sound natural, right?
-Totally.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.740
We got married at a wedding.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.143
This way, my sweet wife.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.212
I'm so excited to wake you up
from a deep sleep

07:25.245 --> 07:27.047
whenever it sounds like
you're having a nightmare.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.982
And I'm excited to know
how you like your hamburgers

07:29.016 --> 07:30.784
so I can order them for you
and ask the waiter

07:30.818 --> 07:32.284
to take it back
when they've made it wrong.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.321
I'm not gonna feel weird
about using your toothbrush

07:34.354 --> 07:36.156
because our gums
are in a partnership.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.158
Yeah, and I'm gonna
wear your gym shorts around

07:38.191 --> 07:40.260
our shared quarters
with nothing up top

07:40.293 --> 07:43.063
because who cares about nudity
with our situation?

07:43.096 --> 07:46.634
-(chuckles) You-you are?
-Sure. I, uh...

07:46.667 --> 07:48.802
I love being married
to my husband.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.838
I love you, too.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.474
You know what, maybe we should
just go back to the ship.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.110
Yeah, pretending to be married
is kind of weird.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.478
-Let's...
-FERENGI: Ah!

07:58.512 --> 08:01.582
Our Starfleet VIPs.
Attention, everyone.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.618
These young lovers
are getting a great deal.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.986
(guests gasping)

08:06.854 --> 08:09.056
(guests cheering)

08:20.367 --> 08:21.569
All right.
(grunts)

08:21.602 --> 08:25.072
Dropping bags off in hotel room
is off the list.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.074
We got the for-profit minibar,
the for-profit toilet,

08:27.107 --> 08:28.842
the machine that charges you
to pay for the toilet

08:28.876 --> 08:29.910
and the minibar.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.812
View screen works.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.346
That's everything.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.948
I give this hotel
a nine out of ten.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.318
Now, off to the Museum
of Bribery.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.120
(music playing)

08:40.153 --> 08:41.688
Oh, weird.
A what-you-call-it--

08:41.722 --> 08:43.557
a "commer-seal"?

08:43.591 --> 08:45.058
Ooh.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.864
-Aah!
-You're fired.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.767
ANNOUNCER:
Slug-O Cola. This happens
to everyone who drinks it.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.803
(laughs)
They just lie to you?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.805
Hilarious.
Well, time to head out.

08:57.838 --> 09:01.308
ANNOUNCER:
And now, Pog & Dar:
Cop Landlords.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.176
-(funky music playing)
-Huh? Mm.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.713
This is like a holo-novel,
but way sleazier.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.147
(both shouting)

09:08.348 --> 09:10.017
POG:
You're making my partner mad.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.185
-Just sign the lease, dirtbag.
-MALE: No.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.955
(indistinct conversations)

09:17.625 --> 09:18.992
Hey, Quimp.

09:19.026 --> 09:22.162
Well, if it isn't
my favorite pathetic human.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.798
-Is that a new pip I see?
-Uh, yep.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.668
-I'm an LJG again, for now.
-(laughs)

09:27.701 --> 09:29.502
Congratulations.
I never thought

09:29.536 --> 09:31.471
you'd dig your way
out of crashing that Oberth.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.207
Ditto. Still, being
a lieutenant kind of sucks.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.010
My stupid mentor won't stop
trying to make feel like

09:37.044 --> 09:39.012
a valued part of the team.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.148
Oh, sounds like
a real nightmare.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.549
You would hate it, too.
But whatever.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.284
You know, I'm excited
to leave all that behind

09:44.317 --> 09:46.086
-so we can hang.
-Read my mind.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.421
Hey, maybe some brunch?
Casual meal with some yogurt.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.790
Two shots of Cardassian tequila
and a dagger of the mind

09:50.824 --> 09:52.192
-on the rocks.
-Wow.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.027
That's pretty hard
for 10:00 a.m.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.363
It's 10:00 a.m.?
Ooh, make it three shots.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.532
Ha! I'll have the same.
It'll be fun to let loose.

09:59.566 --> 10:00.868
Uh, yeah. I need it.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.402
Where'd you even get that one?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.005
-He didn't bring the drinks yet.
-Do we care?

10:05.038 --> 10:06.674
-(glass shatters)
-MALE: Hey!

10:07.507 --> 10:09.677
VASSERY:
Now, Mr. Grand Nagus...

10:09.710 --> 10:11.912
-Just Nagus.
-Sorry. Nagus.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.547
Grand Nagus.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.151
Now that we have paid
our ceremonial invoice,

10:18.185 --> 10:19.720
perhaps we should focus
on the application?

10:19.753 --> 10:21.254
Uh, it's a boilerplate...

10:21.288 --> 10:24.191
Ooh! Do you still play baseball?
We should put in there

10:24.224 --> 10:25.993
that Ferenginar
gets to play baseball.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.627
I like baseball.
It's fun.

10:27.661 --> 10:30.764
I think we can slip that in.
(chuckles)

10:30.798 --> 10:34.534
If that's the type of adjustment
you need to get this done.

10:34.567 --> 10:37.170
I'm just a former bartender,
but I was looking at the numbers

10:37.204 --> 10:39.773
and was wondering
if they could be different.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.642
Different numbers?
I'm not sure what you mean.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.011
-Just a moment, my love.
-(gasps)

10:44.044 --> 10:46.379
Oh. Baseball.

10:46.413 --> 10:50.117
Listen, my husband isn't exactly
a shrewd businessman.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.785
He just likes to feel involved.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.854
Ah, I think I see what you mean.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.189
Play ball!

10:56.223 --> 10:57.424
(laughs)

10:57.457 --> 10:59.326
-Admiral, a word, please?
-Stand down, Captain.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.428
You were saying, First Clerk?

11:01.461 --> 11:03.096
If we can open up the document

11:03.130 --> 11:05.232
and let him shuffle around
a couple of numbers,

11:05.265 --> 11:06.834
he'll feel like
he accomplished something.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.669
-I don't see
any problem with that.
-(clears throat)

11:09.703 --> 11:12.706
This is a classic dumb cop/
reasonable cop routine.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.442
The terms of the membership
application are locked,

11:15.475 --> 11:17.878
-but if we open them up...
-Thank you for
the input, Captain,

11:17.911 --> 11:19.279
but we'll be fine.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.480
-He's practically a child.
-ROM: One, two,

11:20.513 --> 11:21.949
-three strikes.
-(glass shatters)

11:21.982 --> 11:23.216
-You're out.
-VASSERY: Grand Nagus,

11:23.250 --> 11:24.617
I've just reopened the contract.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.319
Why don't you show me
some of the numbers

11:26.353 --> 11:28.455
that seem wrong,
and we'll fix them together?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.358
We'll start on page 11,
subsection B,

11:31.391 --> 11:33.560
incentivization vis-à-vis
the great Ferengi people

11:33.593 --> 11:36.363
and our reluctant acceptance
of your Federation.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.331
-She means bribes.
-Then we'll move

11:38.365 --> 11:40.934
to the tariffs on Ferengi
exports to outlying territories.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.236
DAR:
Freeze! You're under arrest
for having a pet

11:43.270 --> 11:45.438
over 25 pounds
in one of my units.

11:45.472 --> 11:48.175
He was 20 pounds when I got hi.
I swear... (shouts)

11:48.208 --> 11:50.243
-Aah!
-Aah!

11:50.277 --> 11:51.511
DAR: You just surrendered
your deposit

11:51.544 --> 11:54.281
-and your life.
-(Pog coughing)

11:54.314 --> 11:56.183
I'm not gonna make it, partner.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.818
Hey, you hang on
one second, buddy.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.453
I just need to enjoy
the crisp, refreshing taste

12:00.487 --> 12:02.422
-of a Slug-O Cola.
-(laughs)

12:02.455 --> 12:05.058
Oh, they put commercials
in the shows?

12:05.092 --> 12:07.260
It's like mind control.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.962
Transfer your latinum to me,

12:08.996 --> 12:10.998
or I'll tell everyone
you supported tenants' rights.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.866
(coughs)
I'm proud to be scammed

12:12.900 --> 12:16.536
by a landlord cop as conniving
as you, partner.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.438
(groans)

12:19.539 --> 12:21.508
Okay, I guess
I should finally do my...

12:21.541 --> 12:23.110
ANNOUNCER: Up next--
Will They, Won't They?

12:23.143 --> 12:24.477
The workplace sitcom
where everyone

12:24.511 --> 12:25.612
is secretly in love
with each other.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.780
I'm sorry, what?

12:26.814 --> 12:29.249
Oh, Blongo,
I don't know what to do.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.118
I'm secretly in love with Nilm,

12:31.151 --> 12:32.719
but she's engaged to Bok,

12:32.752 --> 12:34.321
-who's always extremely...
-(scoffs)

12:34.354 --> 12:36.223
This kind of hacky,
lowest-common-denominator

12:36.256 --> 12:37.858
schlock won't work on me.

12:37.891 --> 12:41.294
-...her flirtations with Kret.
-But I better watch

12:41.328 --> 12:43.630
so officers who aren't
as resilient as I am

12:43.663 --> 12:44.998
will know what to avoid.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.466
But you should go for it.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.936
Even though I'm secretly
in love with you.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.004
*

12:51.805 --> 12:53.941
Whew! I'm so grateful everything
is shaped like a heart,

12:53.974 --> 12:56.709
or else I'd forget that
I'm here for romantic reasons.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.111
Yeah, it's like,
who decided that hearts

12:58.145 --> 12:59.479
are the universal symbol
for love?

12:59.512 --> 13:01.281
If anything,
it should be kissy lips

13:01.314 --> 13:04.051
or gorgeous green eyes.
Or something.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.418
-What?
-(door whooshes open)

13:05.452 --> 13:08.588
Knock-knock! It's me, Parth,
your hug-cierge.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.523
It's time for your
couple's photo session.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.125
-BOTH: Our what?
-Put on these outfits.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.393
-(chuckles nervously)
-Uh, okay.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.863
RUTHERFORD:
Uh, I'm almost ready.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.697
TENDI:
(grunts) Me, too.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.933
-Mm...
-Uh... Aah!

13:19.967 --> 13:21.334
(both grumble quietly)

13:21.368 --> 13:24.771
(gasps)
Wow. You look so handsome.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.973
Thanks.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.208
And you look, uh... captivating?

13:28.241 --> 13:30.677
Sorry, I'm trying
to make my mind come up

13:30.710 --> 13:31.879
with a less intense word,

13:31.912 --> 13:34.882
but hoo-boy,
is it extremely warm in here?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.249
You bet it is, soldier.

13:36.283 --> 13:39.086
Now, let's commemorate
your love!

13:39.119 --> 13:41.388
Ooh, shameless.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.890
Really press
yourselves together.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.691
Publicly display that affection.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.159
I think that's enough.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.761
No problem.
We'll move on to the lingerie.

13:48.795 --> 13:49.897
-Aah!
-Aah!

13:49.930 --> 13:51.464
Sorry, can't!
Late for dinner.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.804
*

13:59.306 --> 14:00.607
ALL:
Dabo!

14:00.640 --> 14:02.509
(laughs)
Damn, Quimp, I got to admit--

14:02.542 --> 14:03.810
at first I was skeptical,

14:03.843 --> 14:06.613
but Ferengi public libraries
go hard.

14:06.646 --> 14:10.450
I told you, nobody's read a book
in here in a thousand years.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.785
(slurping)
Wow.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.788
You can still drink an alarming
amount of glowing alien liquors,

14:15.822 --> 14:18.658
-but I must call it.
-No, you can't take off now.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.227
We haven't even gotten
to the part of the night

14:20.260 --> 14:22.229
-where we regret stuff.
-Yeah, that

14:22.262 --> 14:24.631
-sounds fun. Oh!
-(grunts) Oh, my goodness.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.534
-A thousand apologies, good sir.
-Oh, not a worry at all.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.502
Did you just
spill a drink on my friend?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.104
I've been a proper fool.
And, of course,

14:31.138 --> 14:32.405
-I'll reimburse...
-You better

14:32.439 --> 14:33.706
get ready to reimburse me for

14:33.740 --> 14:35.542
a new 'burse shirt,
too, butt-ass,

14:35.575 --> 14:37.810
'cause this one's about to be
soaked in your blood.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.914
Madam, please. I'm just trying
to enjoy an evening out

14:40.948 --> 14:42.749
with the rest of my biker gang.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.752
Sounds like this guy's
all bark and no fight!

14:45.785 --> 14:48.221
(grunting)

14:49.022 --> 14:50.991
(laughs, groans)

14:51.024 --> 14:52.960
(shouts)

14:52.993 --> 14:55.195
Oh, Mariner. Ow!

14:59.699 --> 15:01.668
-(Rom humming tune)
-VASSERY: (sighs)
So we'll adjust

15:01.701 --> 15:04.604
the table on page 17
concerning exchange rates.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.073
That would be satisfactory.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.707
I believe we're almost
wrapped up.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.210
Ooh, I have an idea.
Let's finish at my palace.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.878
Much better photo op
for the signing,

15:11.911 --> 15:14.281
plus all my favorite
baseballs are there.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.249
Oh, yeah, yeah,
if that's what it takes, fine.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.584
(clears throat)

15:17.617 --> 15:19.119
He's making you feel
like you're close,

15:19.152 --> 15:21.488
then delaying to make you
frustrated enough

15:21.521 --> 15:24.191
-to sign anything.
-I can't tell the council

15:24.224 --> 15:26.326
we failed
at the simplest of tasks.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.261
All Rom cares about is baseball,

15:28.295 --> 15:30.998
and all Leeta cares about
is fine print.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.533
I... I can do this.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.469
*

15:40.373 --> 15:42.475
The Starfleet Experience
Bar & Grill?

15:42.509 --> 15:43.910
Huh. Maybe this will
feel like we're at work.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.379
Ooh, look! The waiter's
wearing one of those

15:46.413 --> 15:48.048
old velour uniforms that
used to catch fire all the time.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.082
(both gasp)

15:49.116 --> 15:52.352
Oh, good eye, muffin... top.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.786
(both sigh)

15:53.820 --> 15:55.455
Do you think maybe we could--
I don't know--

15:55.488 --> 15:56.923
just go back to acting
like friends for a bit?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.459
Yes. Oh, man,
I'm so glad you said something.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.727
Yeah.
Who knew pretending to be

16:00.760 --> 16:02.762
in a relationship
with each other would be

16:02.795 --> 16:04.897
-more nerve-racking
than sealing a radiation leak?
-Yeah.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.600
Let's just keep it strictly
friend stuff from now on.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.568
Agreed.

16:08.601 --> 16:09.836
-Hello, lovers.
-BOTH: Aah!

16:09.869 --> 16:11.004
I'm so sorry.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.805
The waiter gave you
the standard menus.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.307
-(glass shatters)
-MALE: Hey!
-He didn't know you were

16:14.341 --> 16:16.076
here for our
deluxe romance package.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.046
Parth, buddy,
you're a top-notch hug-cierge,

16:19.079 --> 16:20.880
-but we have to come clean.
-(alarm blares)

16:20.913 --> 16:23.183
Just a second.
Hold that thought.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.185
-Well, well, well.
-(alarm stops)

16:25.218 --> 16:26.519
It looks like we've caught

16:26.553 --> 16:28.321
two people lying about
being a couple

16:28.355 --> 16:31.158
to defraud our company
out of a discount.

16:31.191 --> 16:35.195
This is, of course, one
of Ferenginar's worst felonies.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.996
So these two
are hereby sentenced

16:37.030 --> 16:40.967
to a lifetime working
in the subaquatic sulfur mines!

16:41.000 --> 16:42.669
(sighs)
Sorry about that.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.737
Enforcing the law is my least
favorite part of the job,

16:44.771 --> 16:47.107
but one that I take
with deadly seriousness.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.775
Anyhoo, what were you admitting

16:48.808 --> 16:50.410
before I sentenced
those two liars

16:50.443 --> 16:52.479
to a life of misery?

16:53.313 --> 16:55.548
That we are more in love
than ever before!

16:55.582 --> 16:58.785
-That's right, smumpy.
-Oh, good.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.888
Now for the most
romantic meal possible.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.656
RUTHERFORD:
Sexy chocolate statues

17:03.690 --> 17:05.392
of each other for dinner?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.026
-Great.
-It's customary

17:07.060 --> 17:09.061
that after every bite
you tell the whole restaurant

17:09.096 --> 17:11.198
something you find attractive
about each other.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.367
The chairs can detect
if you're lying, so be sincere.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.002
(cheering, whooping)

17:21.508 --> 17:23.609
MARINER:
Oh, thanks for bailing me
out of jail.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.645
Do you understand how many
people I just had to bribe

17:25.678 --> 17:27.646
to keep your little
drunken fistfight

17:27.680 --> 17:29.816
from ruining Starfleet's
diplomatic mission?

17:29.849 --> 17:31.284
(retches)

17:31.318 --> 17:33.120
Hey, you know me, man.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.921
I'm a wild rogue,
living on the edge of chaos.

17:34.954 --> 17:35.855
I sit weird in chairs.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.257
You can't predict me.
(grunts)

17:37.290 --> 17:38.825
Usually your chaos
means something.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.661
But it's weird this time.
You seem angry about nothing.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.763
Yeah, right. Oh, look,
if anyone's weird, it's you,

17:43.796 --> 17:45.632
Mr. "I Should Probably
Be Getting to Bed."

17:45.665 --> 17:47.100
You've changed, dude.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.702
Yeah, I have. That's what
happens when you're not

17:49.736 --> 17:52.472
stuck in a perpetual state
of immature rebellion.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.840
Wow. Immature?

17:53.873 --> 17:55.442
You have all the support
you ever wanted,

17:55.475 --> 17:57.344
nobody to scream at
or rail against,

17:57.377 --> 17:59.712
and look at you--
still picking fights

17:59.746 --> 18:01.381
to make sure you get hurt.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.983
What? No.
That-That's not what that was.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.787
I just want you to be careful.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.822
So you can live long enough
to pay me back.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.458
If I lose any more,
they'll have to

18:11.491 --> 18:12.892
put my account on this monument.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.262
-(Ferengi crying)
-MARINER: Uh, isn't this

18:15.295 --> 18:16.963
a memorial to the dead?

18:16.996 --> 18:19.332
So much lost income!

18:19.366 --> 18:23.035
Is there no justice
in this galaxy?

18:23.069 --> 18:25.905
Man, I got to give it to you,
Ferengi keep it on-brand.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.876
Sorry I cost you money
and got you punched.

18:29.909 --> 18:33.146
Mariner, I love you,
but you need to figure out

18:33.180 --> 18:35.682
whatever's eating you up inside.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.056
-(patrons applauding)
-Uh...

18:45.425 --> 18:47.960
Uh, Tendi's got...

18:47.994 --> 18:49.329
fun hair?

18:49.362 --> 18:51.431
(cheering)

18:51.464 --> 18:54.234
Uh, uh, I like your hair, too.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.968
PARTH:
Congratulations.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.304
You have completed

18:57.337 --> 19:00.507
the Ferengi all-inclusive
newlywed discount package.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.475
You may now consummate
your marriage.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.710
-What?!
-What?!

19:03.743 --> 19:05.612
(chuckles)
Not where we can see you.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.947
-(both sigh)
-You do it in the blind box,

19:07.980 --> 19:09.516
-where we can hear it.
-(patrons exclaim)

19:09.549 --> 19:11.851
(groaning)

19:11.884 --> 19:13.653
Please alert the chef
that I will be reviewing

19:13.686 --> 19:16.088
this restaurant for my planet's
official foodie archives.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.624
My species invented space travel

19:17.657 --> 19:20.260
in order to seek out
strange new meals.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.628
D'Vana, Samanthan!

19:21.661 --> 19:23.730
What a coincidence.
These are, famously,

19:23.763 --> 19:26.533
the two closest
platonic friends on my ship.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.568
-Huh? Platonic?
-Hello!

19:28.601 --> 19:30.437
-Security!
-Uh...
-Um...

19:30.470 --> 19:34.241
-How dare you
call us only friends?!
-(patrons gasp)

19:34.274 --> 19:37.710
You've been trying to break up
our love from the start!

19:37.744 --> 19:40.847
Uh, yeah.
You know we both love you.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.382
You do?

19:42.415 --> 19:43.983
Just because the Ferengi
newlywed discount

19:44.016 --> 19:46.319
can only be used by two
out of the three of us,

19:46.353 --> 19:48.054
you have the nerve
to come down here

19:48.087 --> 19:50.257
-and try to ruin our marriage?
-MIGLEEMO: Wha...

19:50.290 --> 19:52.024
You guys love me?

19:52.058 --> 19:53.226
Of course we do.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.794
You're undeniably attractive
to both of us.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.029
But now that I see you here,
I want a divorce

19:57.063 --> 19:58.765
-so we can be together.
-But we can't...

19:58.798 --> 20:01.601
Thanks so much, Migleemo.
You ruined our marriage!

20:01.634 --> 20:03.236
We'll never forgive you.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.037
I didn't realize.
I'm sorry.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.574
Please don't break up
because of me.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.076
Security, stand down.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.878
RUTHERFORD:
Now that we're divorced,

20:11.911 --> 20:13.179
we're going back to our ship

20:13.212 --> 20:15.515
-and never talking again.
-That's right.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.451
Huh, I had no idea
they were married

20:18.485 --> 20:20.186
or that they both loved me.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.555
-Can I interest you
in our homewrecker package?
-(laughs)

20:22.589 --> 20:25.658
You don't have to throw up
in my mouth twice. Let's do it.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.094
LEETA:
In addition to the contractual
changes, we are now

20:28.127 --> 20:30.563
allowed use of any ship
in Starfleet at our discretion,

20:30.597 --> 20:33.500
whether we end up joining
the Federation or not.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.435
And ten points on the back end
of every holo-novel program

20:35.468 --> 20:36.836
in perpetuity.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.606
(sighs) I don't think
they have back end,

20:39.639 --> 20:41.240
but yes, yes.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.842
-(whispers)
-Uh-huh.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.345
Also, the Nagus would like you
to dance for him.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.614
(sighs)

20:47.647 --> 20:49.716
(clears throat)
I've made those changes

20:49.749 --> 20:52.319
and added a billion bars
of gold-pressed latinum

20:52.352 --> 20:53.486
as a signing bonus.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.887
Wh-What? Captain!

20:54.921 --> 20:57.357
Keep dancing.
Why so giving, Freeman?

20:57.390 --> 21:00.192
I just want to wrap this up
and free the admiral

21:00.226 --> 21:02.662
before he signs away
the entire fleet. (chuckles)

21:02.695 --> 21:05.965
-He's clearly under your thumb.
-I am not!

21:05.998 --> 21:08.134
I don't buy it.
There has to be a catch.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.870
Of course.
I've added one provision.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.939
Here comes the other shoe.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.942
Before you receive
any of these signing bonuses,

21:15.975 --> 21:19.078
you must recruit
one other planet yourself,

21:19.111 --> 21:22.782
-since you're so good at it.
-What are you thinking, Carol?

21:22.815 --> 21:24.116
That's nothing.
We do it all the time.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.887
Ha! Do you realize
what just happened?

21:27.920 --> 21:30.156
You know how many planets
are in debt to us?

21:30.189 --> 21:32.525
Bringing just one in
will be nothing.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.461
We'll be in debt
to them forever.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.796
It's all right, Admiral.
They get nothing.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.230
-We're done here.
-(Rom laughs)

21:38.264 --> 21:39.899
What?
What do you mean?

21:39.932 --> 21:41.200
You owe us a fortune.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.404
Yes, contingent
on bringing in a planet.

21:44.437 --> 21:47.039
But I didn't say which planet.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.708
You might want to read
the fine print.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.309
(muttering)

21:50.343 --> 21:53.446
Qo'noS, the Klingon homeworld?
That's impossible!

21:53.480 --> 21:54.847
Oh, I know.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.016
You forgot the eighth rule
of acquisition.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.986
"Small print
leads to large risk."

22:00.019 --> 22:02.789
(gasps) You swindled
like a true Ferengi.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.624
I swear I had
nothing to do with this.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.993
You're lucky she did.
As much as we're

22:07.026 --> 22:08.728
in favor
of joining the Federation,

22:08.761 --> 22:11.898
the Grand Nagus can't sign with
a bunch of suckers and rubes.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.266
Captain Freeman, you showed me
that there are those

22:14.300 --> 22:16.703
in the Federation
who respect our culture.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.439
Let's start over.
Bring me the standard papers.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.641
I'll sign.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.615
(sighs)
Please accept my apologies.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.316
I shouldn't have doubted you.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.752
I'll be relaying
your acuity to Command.

22:32.785 --> 22:35.187
Thank you, Admiral.
Happy to be of aid.

22:35.221 --> 22:38.591
Now, who wants to check out
my batting cages?

22:38.625 --> 22:42.395
FREEMAN:
With the application submitted,
so begins the first step

22:42.429 --> 22:44.897
to the Ferengi
joining the Federation.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.899
There are many more
hurdles to leap,

22:46.933 --> 22:50.069
but today felt like
a good start.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.541
Well, Mariner, was guide duty
as fun as rumored?

22:54.574 --> 22:56.008
Uh, I had to take out
a predatory loan

22:56.042 --> 22:57.243
from one of my closest friends,

22:57.276 --> 22:58.911
apparently I get
in fights for no reason,

22:58.945 --> 23:01.914
and I can feel my hangover
in my entire spine.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.550
Why are you getting into fights?

23:03.583 --> 23:05.585
Ugh. You wouldn't understand.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.720
Okay.
How about you two?

23:07.754 --> 23:08.988
How was the couple's retreat?

23:09.021 --> 23:10.823
Oh, faking a relationship
was way,

23:10.857 --> 23:12.358
way out of our
comfort zone, sir.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.094
Yeah, we just don't have
any natural chemistry.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.964
-Want to help me reroute
that phase conduit?
-Sure.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.466
Ha!

23:19.499 --> 23:21.868
We got to squeeze in there.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.836
-Hand me the spanner.
-On it.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.972
(sighs)
Now, this makes sense.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.841
Wait, where's Mr. Boimler?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.342
(PADD rings)

23:30.376 --> 23:32.512
Mr. Boimler, did you do
too many locations?

23:32.545 --> 23:34.146
-Are you in need of aid?
-Uh, no.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.717
I watched eight hours straight
of Ferengi programming.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.819
I'm sorry I let you down, sir.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.054
-Honestly, I'm proud of you.
-Really?

23:42.088 --> 23:44.256
You've always had a problem
going with the flow,

23:44.290 --> 23:46.859
but today it looks like
you got out of your own way.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.260
Thank you, sir.

23:48.294 --> 23:49.529
I've authorized
the local authorities

23:49.562 --> 23:50.897
to drag you out of there.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.164
Just go limp,
don't fight them.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.700
-(Boimler screaming)
-Get out of here!

23:54.601 --> 23:56.536
-(laughs)
-(screaming continues)

23:56.569 --> 23:57.970
I really like that lieutenant.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.606
-(whip cracking)
-BOIMLER: Oh! Aah!

23:59.639 --> 24:03.710
Oh! Oh, no. Oh, oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no! (grunts)

Chirp.
