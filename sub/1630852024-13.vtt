WEBVTT

00:01.958 --> 00:04.439
[Jughead] The fog had cleared
and the world had changed.

00:04.482 --> 00:06.832
For Betty and Archie,
the results of her
pregnancy test

00:06.876 --> 00:08.878
had come with mixed emotions.

00:08.921 --> 00:12.229
All tinged with a hint of
what might have been.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.491
I'm relieved.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.583
Are you? I mean,
what would we have done

00:18.627 --> 00:21.282
if there had been
two lines on that thing?

00:21.325 --> 00:23.806
Yeah. There would have been
a lot to figure out.

00:23.849 --> 00:28.245
Starting with, how do you raise
a kid without totally screwing
them up?

00:28.289 --> 00:31.640
[chuckles softly] I mean,
look at the examples I had.
My mom...

00:31.683 --> 00:36.036
Is my mom and my dad
was a serial killer, so...

00:36.079 --> 00:40.910
Does the opposite of what
my mom and dad did count as
a parenting style?

00:42.564 --> 00:44.522
I don't know.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.437
I think we would have gotten
the hang of it together.

00:48.135 --> 00:50.267
Are you disappointed?

00:50.311 --> 00:54.097
Look, I know that timing
is completely wrong.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.708
But I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't

00:56.752 --> 01:00.190
a little bit excited
about the idea of starting
a new life with you.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.018
Everything has been so dark.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.324
A baby would have been...

01:05.369 --> 01:06.370
A light.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.288
My dad loved being a young dad.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.899
I mean, he talked about it
all the time.

01:13.943 --> 01:16.989
Your dad is the world's
best father.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.687
No question.

01:18.730 --> 01:19.992
Yeah.

01:20.036 --> 01:22.734
[soft instrumental
music playing]

01:22.778 --> 01:26.129
It will happen... Someday.

01:26.173 --> 01:29.785
Maybe the universe just wants
us to stop the bad guys first.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.964
[Jughead] For Veronica
and Reggie,

01:35.007 --> 01:37.097
the new day dawned
with bitterness and bile.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.707
Don't forget this.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.187
You definitely won't be
waking up here anymore.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.928
So it's going to be like that?

01:42.972 --> 01:44.626
The more I think about
what you said the other night,

01:44.669 --> 01:48.064
giving me ultimatums,
the less well it sits with me.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.979
Especially since
you stole from us.

01:50.022 --> 01:53.156
For the record, Ronnie,
I was going to share

01:53.200 --> 01:55.027
the income from
the satellite casino.

01:55.071 --> 01:57.508
[scoffs] Sure.

01:57.552 --> 02:00.990
You know, I've really been
trying to see this whole thing
from your point of view,

02:01.033 --> 02:05.299
but, sadly, I can't seem to get
my head that far up my ass.

02:05.342 --> 02:08.171
You know what? Good thing
I'm getting out of this now.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.912
I wouldn't want to end up dead.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.697
What is that supposed to mean?

02:12.741 --> 02:15.396
First Chad, then Hiram.
What was it they called you,

02:15.439 --> 02:18.050
the "Black Widow
of Wall Street?"

02:18.094 --> 02:20.531
Hmm.

02:20.575 --> 02:23.534
Unless you're ready to hear
the long list of names
I'd like to call you right now,

02:23.578 --> 02:25.188
I'd quit while you're ahead.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.408
Go for it. You've never spared
my feelings before.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.192
Plus, now you can hook up
with Heraldo.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.151
Oh, my God. With who? Heraldo?

02:31.194 --> 02:32.587
Oh, come on.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.154
I saw how you guys
looked at each other.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.764
You'll text him
soon as I leave.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.200
You're flailing
and it's pathetic.

02:37.244 --> 02:40.290
Whatever. First it was Archie.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.683
Then it was me.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.119
-Then it was Archie.
-[sighs]

02:43.163 --> 02:44.555
Then it was Chad.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.601
Then it was Archie.

02:46.644 --> 02:49.604
And then you came back to me
without a break.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.301
You...

02:53.738 --> 02:54.739
You can't be alone.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.179
[whispering]
It's not in your nature.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.094
Hmm.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.192
[sighs]

03:12.235 --> 03:15.456
[Jughead] As for us,
Tabitha was in Albany
working to get Pop's

03:15.499 --> 03:17.066
declared a historical landmark

03:17.109 --> 03:20.504
and I, like so many of us,
was waiting.

03:20.548 --> 03:24.378
Percival was Riverdale's
new self-appointed Mayor.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.206
What would Percival's
first move be?

03:26.249 --> 03:28.251
We wondered.

03:28.295 --> 03:31.123
Though, when it came, I admit
we were all caught off guard.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.690
The hell are you guys
doing here?

03:32.734 --> 03:36.259
We're here on behalf of
Riverdale Public Library.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.435
It's closing,
you might have heard.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.263
[Jughead] Huh!

03:40.307 --> 03:42.483
Why?

03:42.526 --> 03:44.398
Well, eventually, of course,
it will be a hotel to service
the new railway.

03:44.441 --> 03:49.490
[scoffs] Riverdale, a town
without a public library.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.014
-Nice.
-[Percival] In any case, I've
been going over the library's

03:52.057 --> 03:56.105
outstanding accounts tracking
down books that were
never returned.

03:56.148 --> 03:59.195
And according to my records,
you have an outstanding copy

03:59.239 --> 04:02.067
of Kafka's The Metamorphosis,
you little intellectual.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.852
What?

04:03.895 --> 04:06.855
I must have checked that
book out, like, ten years ago.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.248
May I have it, please?

04:09.945 --> 04:10.946
Are you serious?

04:12.861 --> 04:14.776
I was homeless ten years ago.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.430
I have no idea
where that thing is.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.953
Let me just pay you the fee

04:17.996 --> 04:20.216
and you can replace it
with a new one.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.697
Well, the late fees are
in the thousands of
dollars by now, Mr. Jones,

04:22.740 --> 04:24.873
and it was a very
particular edition.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.310
Any replacement would have to
be that exact version,

04:27.354 --> 04:29.573
and I'm afraid
it's out of print.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.315
Okay. If you're shutting down
the library, why do you
need this book?

04:32.359 --> 04:34.230
It's the principle.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.406
I mean, that book is property
of the town.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.452
Currently stolen property.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.584
Just replace it and all fees
will be waived.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.760
Fine. I'll look for it.

04:42.804 --> 04:46.111
Do. In the meantime,
I'll need collateral. Um...

04:46.155 --> 04:48.070
How about this?

04:51.639 --> 04:54.685
Uh, no. My grandfather
wrote that and gave it to me.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.861
It's inscribed.

04:56.905 --> 05:00.125
Take, um... Take the signed
first edition of
DeLillo's Underworld.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.779
No. This is the item
we require.

05:01.823 --> 05:02.867
Isn't that right, gentlemen?

05:02.911 --> 05:05.000
[gun cocking]

05:05.043 --> 05:07.307
But fair is fair, Mr. Jones.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.134
Find the book
you owe the town,

05:09.178 --> 05:10.919
you get yours back.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.313
[Jughead]
And surprise, surprise.

05:13.356 --> 05:17.404
Mine wasn't the only home
visited in search of overdue
library books.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.667
[Percival] According to
my records, Mr. Andrews,

05:19.710 --> 05:22.800
you checked out
Songwriting From The Heart

05:22.844 --> 05:24.585
and never returned it.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.326
Yeah, I borrowed that book
when I was in high school.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.589
[Percival] Mmm.

05:28.632 --> 05:31.374
On the recommendation of your
music teacher Geraldine Grundy,
I believe.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.727
Uh, maybe. Look, I have no clue
where that book is.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.729
Well, in that case, you'd need
to replace the book

05:38.773 --> 05:40.775
with a copy from the exact
same edition,

05:40.818 --> 05:43.604
and I think that publish
has gone out of business.

05:44.256 --> 05:45.345
[chuckles]

05:47.042 --> 05:49.218
This is ridiculous.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.263
Sure. I'll find a copy
of the book for you.

05:51.307 --> 05:52.787
Good man.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.963
Until then,
I'll need some collateral,

05:55.006 --> 05:57.400
something so I know
you're taking me seriously.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.836
How about...

06:00.447 --> 06:02.492
Ah, that guitar?

06:02.536 --> 06:04.581
The one Ms. Grundy taught you
on feels appropriate,
doesn't it?

06:04.625 --> 06:07.105
[intense music playing]

06:07.149 --> 06:11.371
If you touch one more thing
in my house, I'll break both
of your arms.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.981
This little nugget
says different.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.157
Excuse me.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.685
We won't take up too much
of your time, Ms. Lodge.

06:21.729 --> 06:24.514
We're looking for an overdue
library book of yours.

06:24.558 --> 06:28.388
Kiss of the Spider Woman
by Manuel Puig.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.738
What are you,
the library police?

06:30.781 --> 06:33.958
With a book as overdue as this,
the late fees run into
the thousands of dollars.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.702
Just tell me how much
I owe you.

06:38.746 --> 06:42.445
Um, well, if the book is lost,
uh, you could be charged

06:42.489 --> 06:45.840
with a misdemeanor
subject to jail time.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.929
But all late fees
will be waived...

06:47.972 --> 06:49.887
-If I find the book?
-Yes.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.847
I'll try to track it down.

06:52.890 --> 06:56.241
Good. In the meantime,
we'll just take that
as collateral.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.373
[chuckles]

06:57.417 --> 06:59.854
Knock yourself out.

06:59.897 --> 07:03.466
-[Cheryl] Flowers in the Attic?
-By V.C. Andrews.

07:03.510 --> 07:07.165
[chuckles] Yeah,
I know who wrote it,
you crumpet-eating buffoon.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.776
Do you have it or not,
Ms. Blossom?

07:08.819 --> 07:10.473
[Cheryl sighs]

07:10.517 --> 07:13.563
The last time I read that book,
I was with an old friend

07:13.607 --> 07:15.609
who I haven't seen
in a very long time.

07:16.653 --> 07:17.828
I believe she must have it.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.743
Yes, Heather, wasn't it?

07:21.528 --> 07:23.268
Um, how did you know that?

07:23.312 --> 07:25.314
Oh, I'm very perceptive.

07:25.357 --> 07:28.143
Well, until you find it
or an exact copy of it,

07:28.186 --> 07:29.797
I'll need some collateral.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.625
Um, how about...

07:32.190 --> 07:33.583
Ah!

07:33.627 --> 07:34.715
That trunk.

07:35.846 --> 07:38.458
[intense music playing]

07:38.501 --> 07:39.937
You can't have that.

07:39.981 --> 07:43.811
I'll take the trunk
or you to the stocks.

07:43.854 --> 07:46.378
You know, we haven't spent
much quality time together yet,

07:46.422 --> 07:49.381
but I should warn you,
you're playing with fire.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.992
Hmm.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.211
Would you burn all of us,
Ms. Blossom?

07:53.255 --> 07:56.301
-No, just you.
-Indeed.

07:56.345 --> 07:59.087
Which is why my men have
a very specific instruction

07:59.130 --> 08:01.219
if I get even the least
bit flushed...

08:02.307 --> 08:03.439
Aim for her head.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.010
Take the damn trunk,
but I have to empty it first.

08:09.053 --> 08:11.012
No! I'll take the trunk
and its contents.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.579
But don't worry,

08:12.622 --> 08:14.058
we'll take very good care of
your brother.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.539
[music intensifying]

08:16.583 --> 08:18.498
[cell phone ringing]

08:19.411 --> 08:20.848
Hey, Mom, What's up?

08:20.891 --> 08:23.024
Hey, honey, uh,
do you remember that book,

08:23.067 --> 08:25.548
Small Engine Repairsthat you
checked out of the library?

08:25.592 --> 08:28.464
You mean when I was 12?
Vaguely.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.727
Mayor Pickens is collecting
all overdue library books.

08:30.771 --> 08:31.685
He needs it back.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.645
Uh, might be in
my room somewhere.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.473
No, I checked. It's not there.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.692
Well, you're going to need
to find it

08:38.735 --> 08:40.258
or at least an exact copy.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.304
I gave him your diary
as collateral.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.568
You did what?

08:45.612 --> 08:47.918
Yeah. Aren't you glad I didn't
let you burn that last one?

08:47.962 --> 08:51.356
So I am cooking yummy
beef stroganoff for dinner.
How does that--

08:53.924 --> 08:55.447
[sighs]

08:55.491 --> 08:57.580
[Percival] Well,
you remember, Mr. Mantle,

08:57.624 --> 09:00.409
it's a workbook. One that
teaches children with dyslexia
how to read.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.586
-[Reggie] Give me a sec.
-[Percival] Mmm-hmm.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.247
[exhales]

09:12.290 --> 09:13.378
[Percival chuckles]

09:15.859 --> 09:17.861
Fifteen years after it was
checked out

09:17.905 --> 09:19.689
you actually still have it.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.605
I'm impressed, Mr. Mantle.

09:22.649 --> 09:26.957
I've long suspected there's
more than meets the eye
with you.

09:27.001 --> 09:29.264
So what? Do I have to pay
a fine or something?

09:29.307 --> 09:31.048
Oh, no.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.007
We'll just leave the matter of
your debt for another day.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.666
[Jughead] By nightfall,
we realized that Percival
and his goons

09:39.709 --> 09:41.624
had paid all of us a visit.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.626
So I convened a meeting.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.934
My father pulled off some
pretty bizarre villainy
in his day

09:46.977 --> 09:49.197
but shutting down a library?

09:49.240 --> 09:52.243
There is a purpose behind
what Percival is doing.

09:52.287 --> 09:55.029
Books promote ideas
and free thinking.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.640
They're terrifying objects to
would be despots like him.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.556
If people stop reading
and thinking and dreaming,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.037
it makes it easier for them
to just follow Percival.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.257
But shaking us down
for overdue library books

10:06.301 --> 10:08.085
with goons and guns?

10:08.129 --> 10:09.870
What is so special
about our books?

10:09.913 --> 10:11.349
Or the agitators?

10:11.393 --> 10:13.351
Maybe it's a distraction,
for his next move.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.702
Well, he's not interested in
the money.

10:15.745 --> 10:18.792
Though he did threaten to
arrest me if I didn't find
my book.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.445
Yeah, but have you ever heard
of people

10:20.489 --> 10:22.926
being thrown in jail
for an overdue library book?

10:22.970 --> 10:27.627
Yeah, actually. Some states
consider the failure to return
library books as theft.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.935
Well, I have no idea where
my book is.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.894
Yeah, me neither.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.723
I lent a bunch of my books
to Doc, my friend,
on Sketch Alley.

10:36.766 --> 10:41.684
And then Percival suggested
that he and the other unhoused
just leave.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.555
I mean, they could be anywhere
and so could my book.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.776
Cheryl?

10:46.820 --> 10:48.822
You've been pretty quiet.

10:48.865 --> 10:53.261
Methinks there is a whiff
of sorcery about all of this.

10:53.304 --> 10:57.395
Books are objects of
immense power.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.702
Every reader imprints
on the book they read.

10:59.746 --> 11:03.619
Every book changes the reader
in some way.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.710
If Percival knows
what books we read
during our formative years...

11:07.754 --> 11:09.712
[sighs] My mind reels
of what he might do

11:09.756 --> 11:12.628
with that secret
forbidden knowledge.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.065
[Kevin] I can't believe they
actually gave these things up.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.719
[Percival]
Men with guns, Kevin.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.678
Most potent form of persuasion.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.984
Yeah, but all this for
library books?

11:22.856 --> 11:24.727
Oh, Kevin.

11:24.771 --> 11:28.252
If you steal from a town,
even if it's just a paperback,

11:28.296 --> 11:32.909
you tear at that town's civic
fabric, its sense of order.

11:32.953 --> 11:36.652
We must hold the line,
especially against these
demagogues.

11:36.696 --> 11:42.136
Now they claim to love
Riverdale, to want to save it,
to fight for it.

11:42.179 --> 11:46.227
But can anything be worse than
stealing from the very place
you profess to love?

11:47.445 --> 11:49.534
They're hypocrites.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.232
And we must punish
them accordingly.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.497
That, and test their
psychological mettle.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.936
You're not going to hurt them,
are you?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.592
Doubting me, Kevin?

12:03.635 --> 12:05.507
That's interesting.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.074
Because according
to my records,

12:07.117 --> 12:09.250
there's still one more
book left to collect.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.688
Lord of the Flies.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.431
And unless I'm very much
mistaken, the last person to
check that out was you.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.649
I loved that book as a kid.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.695
Well, then find it, Kevin.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.002
And bring it unto me now.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.614
I still have work
to do tonight,

12:25.657 --> 12:27.790
and I don't want
any naysayers in my midst.

12:40.237 --> 12:44.198
Loquere, objecta,
da mysteria tua.

12:44.241 --> 12:49.290
Ex libris ad animas, frequenta
manus unde venistis.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.206
[continues indistinctly]

13:08.222 --> 13:10.050
[indistinct chatter]

13:10.093 --> 13:11.703
[boys laughing]

13:13.009 --> 13:14.576
Oh, my God.

13:14.619 --> 13:15.664
What's so funny?

13:15.707 --> 13:17.274
Say it ain't so, Sarge.

13:17.318 --> 13:21.757
You played guitar at
the Variety Show? And sang?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.803
That was about
a million years ago.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.848
What are you even doing with
that yearbook?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.763
I just found it on a table
in the library
just sitting there.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.460
Well, put it away.
It's time for class.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.685
[man] What d'ya got, kid?

13:37.904 --> 13:39.296
Hey, kid...

13:39.340 --> 13:40.994
[Reggie] Uh...

13:41.037 --> 13:42.169
I've got nothing.

13:44.693 --> 13:45.737
I'm out.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.261
[dramatic music playing]

13:58.054 --> 14:00.056
[woman] Agent Cooper?

14:00.100 --> 14:03.886
This is the latest profile
the psychologist came up
with for TBK.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.715
"Intelligent, antisocial,
highly skilled,

14:06.758 --> 14:10.675
lacking empathy,
likely a loner."

14:10.719 --> 14:13.113
They couldn't be more
boilerplate if they tried.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.725
Ugh. What is that smell?

14:18.553 --> 14:21.295
Oh, my God. I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

14:21.338 --> 14:24.254
It's bleach I think. Should I
get you some water?

14:25.995 --> 14:27.823
[intense music playing]

14:32.654 --> 14:33.568
Dad?

14:34.612 --> 14:35.526
Agent Cooper?

14:37.485 --> 14:38.486
You all right?

14:39.095 --> 14:41.358
Uh...

14:41.402 --> 14:44.013
[Veronica] Hello, Heraldo.
I'm calling to check in about
my abuelita.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.580
[Heraldo] Seems to be
doing fine. Why?

14:45.623 --> 14:48.626
Actually, Heraldo,
can I call you back?

14:50.454 --> 14:52.761
Nope, not today, spider.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.341
[keyboard clacking]

15:07.384 --> 15:10.126
[Jughead] I spent the morning
on my laptop. Not writing,
no, hunting.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.564
For copies of
The Metamorphosis ...

15:13.608 --> 15:15.610
Which is when I noticed that
my fingers were bleeding.

15:19.614 --> 15:23.400
Ms. Cooper, are you
by any chance here
to return your book?

15:23.444 --> 15:25.054
Small Engine Repairs?

15:25.098 --> 15:27.578
No, but my mom had no right
to give you my diary.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.753
So I want it back.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.496
What do you...

15:33.889 --> 15:34.934
What are you doing with this?

15:35.673 --> 15:36.936
Oh...

15:36.979 --> 15:38.154
Just a little bit of cleaning.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.331
Did you know, Ms. Cooper,

15:41.375 --> 15:44.639
there is no more powerful
memory trigger than
a potent scent.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.816
Isn't it fascinating what
the mind is susceptible to?

15:47.859 --> 15:51.385
Imagine a normal household item
like bleach,

15:51.428 --> 15:54.301
unlocking a door that
hadn't been opened in years.

15:54.344 --> 15:55.693
What's behind it, I wonder.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.044
Some crippling secret?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.177
Give me my diary.

16:01.961 --> 16:02.962
No.

16:04.354 --> 16:07.183
I could maybe let you
read it here.

16:07.227 --> 16:11.274
I have a wonderful reading
nook and my men would
help you get settled.

16:15.365 --> 16:16.410
Fine.

16:20.501 --> 16:23.286
[kids laughing in background]

16:23.330 --> 16:25.071
[laughter continues]

16:33.122 --> 16:34.776
[laughter continues]

16:45.091 --> 16:46.135
Hello?

16:49.965 --> 16:50.966
Is someone there?

16:55.797 --> 16:57.886
[breathing heavily]

17:00.106 --> 17:02.064
Heather?

17:02.108 --> 17:03.500
[heavy breathing continues]

17:05.415 --> 17:07.287
[music intensifies]

17:12.944 --> 17:13.945
Heather?

17:14.598 --> 17:15.773
Is that you?

17:15.817 --> 17:17.645
[breathing heavily]

17:22.780 --> 17:24.782
[kids laughter]

17:27.133 --> 17:28.786
Flowers in the Atticindeed.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.832
[bell ringing]

17:33.356 --> 17:35.358
[cello music playing]

17:45.325 --> 17:47.327
[music continues]

17:59.687 --> 18:01.123
Ms. Grundy?

18:01.167 --> 18:02.255
[music stops]

18:06.607 --> 18:08.609
[cello music starts]

18:19.794 --> 18:21.361
[panting]

18:23.885 --> 18:27.715
[Jughead] It was like
something out of
a David Cronenberg movie.

18:27.758 --> 18:32.546
My hands were getting itchier,
rawer, more painful.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.765
I was either coming down
with a horrible case of eczema

18:34.809 --> 18:37.681
or I was turning into
a cockroach like in
The Metamorphosis.

18:37.725 --> 18:38.769
Either way,

18:38.813 --> 18:40.380
I had to find that book.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.990
Bro, I need my book back.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.905
When I was a kid, I was
diagnosed with dyslexia,

18:43.948 --> 18:46.081
and that kid's book taught me
how to read.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.692
I never thought
I'd need it again, but I do.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.868
So please, can I have it?

18:50.912 --> 18:53.349
No. But can I interest you

18:53.393 --> 18:56.961
in this very fine
limited edition

18:57.005 --> 18:58.398
Glamerge egg?

18:58.441 --> 19:00.051
Why would I want that?

19:00.095 --> 19:02.184
Doesn't Ms. Lodge collect them?

19:02.228 --> 19:03.533
Yeah, but we just broke up.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.970
It was brutal.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.842
Well, maybe, in that case,
the egg could serve as

19:07.885 --> 19:09.235
a parting blow.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.281
I just want my book back.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.938
Take the egg to Veronica.
[echoing]

19:16.981 --> 19:19.506
[in normal voice] And then,
maybe we can discuss your book

19:19.549 --> 19:21.508
and any other opportunities.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.293
You strike me as
the sort of man who is
always on the lookout

19:24.337 --> 19:26.817
for the next great opportunity.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.216
[Betty sighs]

19:34.260 --> 19:35.870
I had an episode today.

19:37.654 --> 19:41.049
I was working the TBK case
at the FBI office

19:41.092 --> 19:44.095
and there was a janitor there
mopping the floor with bleach,

19:44.139 --> 19:48.012
and I had a visceral
response to the smell.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.275
I mean, I almost threw up.

19:51.407 --> 19:54.541
And I saw a flash of my father.

19:54.584 --> 19:58.066
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, the smell dislodged...

19:58.109 --> 20:00.286
something in me,
like a memory.

20:00.329 --> 20:04.246
So I went to Percival's shop
to get my diary back
so I could confirm it.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.379
And did you get it back?

20:07.728 --> 20:11.297
No, but I read it,
and there was something.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.168
It was an entry
from when I was 12,

20:13.212 --> 20:15.344
and at the time,
I didn't think anything of it.

20:15.388 --> 20:19.130
But that's when I checked out
Small Engine Repairs
from the library.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.045
I couldn't get enough
of that book.

20:21.089 --> 20:24.397
And one night, I was so excited
to show my dad what I learned

20:24.440 --> 20:27.313
about spark plugs
and carburetors.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.923
I went down to the garage.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.193
Daddy, what are you doing?

20:38.237 --> 20:40.195
Oh, just a little clean-up.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.112
What's that smell?

20:45.722 --> 20:47.246
Oh, that... That's bleach.

20:49.030 --> 20:52.338
Your mommy uses that sometimes.
It's a disinfectant.

20:52.381 --> 20:54.383
It can get pretty dirty
working on cars.

20:54.427 --> 20:58.605
So it's always good
to keep some handy.
It covers up everything.

20:58.648 --> 21:02.348
[Betty] Looking back on it now,
it seems so obvious.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.437
I mean, we had never
known precisely

21:04.480 --> 21:08.092
when my dad started killing
people, but I'm thinking
about it now.

21:08.136 --> 21:12.619
And when I was a little girl,
I was smelling the bleach
my dad was using

21:12.662 --> 21:16.579
to scrub the blood
of his victims
out of our family car.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.059
It was right there.

21:18.102 --> 21:20.975
It was right under my nose,
and I missed it.

21:21.018 --> 21:24.326
Hey, you were 12 years old,
and he was your dad.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.807
Every child should be able
to trust their parent.

21:28.243 --> 21:32.900
Percival knows what
he's doing, Archie.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.685
I mean, playing these
mind games with me

21:35.729 --> 21:38.035
and making me
relive these things.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.257
Anything weird happen
to you today?

21:44.041 --> 21:46.130
Nothing. Nothing I want to
talk about.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.961
This is not a good feeling.

21:51.005 --> 21:54.443
It's like someone's picking
through my brain
with dirty fingers.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.322
Hey.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.019
Hi there.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.673
Uh...

22:06.716 --> 22:08.196
My name is Jughead Jones.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.806
I actually used to live on
the alley here.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.244
-Hank.
-Hi, Hank.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.551
I was hoping that you could
help me.

22:15.595 --> 22:18.815
A bunch of people used to
live here, including a friend
of mine named Doc.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.603
Yeah, I know Doc.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.169
Do you know what happened
to him and the others?

22:26.475 --> 22:29.739
A man came, British.

22:29.783 --> 22:32.046
He gathered us up,
Doc included.

22:32.089 --> 22:37.007
Told us to start walking west
and not to stop
until we hit the ocean.

22:37.051 --> 22:39.227
And that's what everyone did.

22:39.270 --> 22:42.839
Gathered their things
and started walking

22:42.883 --> 22:44.711
like they had no choice.

22:45.668 --> 22:47.061
Why didn't you go?

22:47.104 --> 22:49.411
The man said "walk."

22:49.455 --> 22:51.413
That's the one thing
I can't do.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.374
Doc has something of mine.

22:55.417 --> 22:58.725
It's, um... It's a book,
and I-I actually need it.

22:58.768 --> 23:01.684
You don't know where he ended
up, do you, or how I can get
this message to him?

23:02.685 --> 23:04.557
Yeah.

23:04.600 --> 23:08.778
I may have the number for
a payphone in Venice Beach.

23:08.822 --> 23:12.303
Venice... Like California?

23:12.347 --> 23:14.131
The man said "head west."

23:16.395 --> 23:17.961
[Veronica] Reggie dropped
this off, you say?

23:18.005 --> 23:20.137
He did, Ms. Veronica.

23:20.181 --> 23:21.182
[Veronica] Huh.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.446
Fascinating.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.231
Oh, and, Smithers,
any luck finding
Kiss of the Spider Woman?

23:27.275 --> 23:29.059
Uh, not the edition
you're looking for.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.974
It's elusive, I'm afraid.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.629
Try the Strand in New York,
would you, please?

23:33.673 --> 23:34.674
Thank you, Smithers.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.114
[music box playing]

23:40.157 --> 23:41.289
[screams]

23:42.203 --> 23:43.291
[exhales]

23:52.256 --> 23:53.954
[music playing]

23:56.783 --> 23:59.829
Sorry, it took me a while
to track down.
My dad's house is a mess.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.048
No, it's... It's cool.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.224
I'm just glad you
still have it.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.269
I didn't even remember you
lent it to me.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.054
It's a wild book.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.882
[both chuckle]

24:08.925 --> 24:11.711
I was in lust
with the hero, Ralph.

24:11.754 --> 24:15.105
Oh, same, but I mostly
identified with Piggy.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.630
The guy that gets crushed
by a boulder?

24:18.326 --> 24:19.414
Why?

24:20.241 --> 24:21.285
You remember, Moose?

24:21.329 --> 24:23.984
I was husky as a kid.

24:24.027 --> 24:26.029
I used to wear these glasses.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.553
-Thick ones.
-Mmm.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.816
I was super awkward,
physically.

24:29.859 --> 24:32.514
I felt like the character of
Piggy was written for me.

24:32.558 --> 24:35.474
If it makes you feel better,
you are definitely Ralph now.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.780
Totally hot.

24:37.824 --> 24:44.395
Maybe on the outside, but once
a Piggy, always a Piggy.

24:44.439 --> 24:46.963
[Veronica] Okay, Cheryl, what
the hell is going on with us?

24:47.007 --> 24:48.835
I'm glad you asked, Veronica.

24:48.878 --> 24:51.228
That's why I brought us here.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.274
I've been doing some reading,
occult volumes I've collected
over the years.

24:53.317 --> 24:57.539
I may have further insight
into Percival's machinations.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.194
Okay, when spell casting,
an enchanter uses
personal items

25:00.237 --> 25:02.239
to focus their magic
on their targets.

25:02.283 --> 25:06.026
Strands of hair,
fingernail clippings,
clothing, or, in our case,

25:06.069 --> 25:09.682
the collateral he received
from our missing library books.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.293
I believe Percival is using
these items as totems

25:12.336 --> 25:14.295
to harness or manifest phantoms

25:14.338 --> 25:17.211
from our past or our
subconscious to haunt us,

25:17.254 --> 25:19.430
test us, torment us.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.215
Does that resonate with anyone?

25:22.303 --> 25:24.261
Maybe.

25:24.305 --> 25:28.918
Percival took a book
my grandfather had written
and given to me.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.486
My grandfather died back
when I was in New York.
He, uh...

25:32.879 --> 25:34.097
He was covered in eczema.

25:35.098 --> 25:36.143
Especially his hands...

25:37.840 --> 25:39.233
Which were
completely disfigured.

25:39.276 --> 25:40.843
Oh, my God, Jug!

25:43.629 --> 25:46.849
One of my greatest fears
is that I'll die alone
like him,

25:46.893 --> 25:48.590
only having written one book.

25:48.634 --> 25:49.939
How do we stop
what's happening?

25:49.983 --> 25:52.333
It's pretty straightforward.

25:52.376 --> 25:55.075
Find our missing library books,
get back our confiscated items,
break his spell.

25:55.118 --> 25:58.687
But would Percival even return
our things at this point?

25:58.731 --> 26:01.081
He said he would.
"Fair is fair."

26:01.124 --> 26:03.997
Indeed. There are rules
when spell weaving.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.347
A certain order that needs
to be maintained.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.741
You seem pretty blase
about this, Cheryl.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.439
I've always dabbled
in the supernatural.

26:11.482 --> 26:15.791
And I'm pretty comfortable with
the ghost that's been invoked
from my past.

26:15.835 --> 26:18.402
We gave Percival the tools
to hurt us.

26:18.446 --> 26:20.709
What if we can't find
our books?

26:20.753 --> 26:22.972
Then we have no choice
but to face our demons

26:23.016 --> 26:24.887
and hope we survive
the encounters.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.283
[glass breaking]

26:33.766 --> 26:35.768
[dramatic music playing]

27:06.320 --> 27:08.322
[Percival reading]

27:18.898 --> 27:19.986
Hey, again.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.161
Did you get ahold of Doc?

27:21.204 --> 27:22.684
Yeah, I got ahold of him.

27:24.686 --> 27:25.687
You doing okay?

27:25.731 --> 27:27.907
No. Definitely not doing okay.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.517
That's why I need my book.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.084
About that.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.695
Doc said he sold it
as they were heading west.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.828
Had to shed everything
they were carrying with them

27:35.871 --> 27:36.916
to travel light.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.613
Okay. Uh...

27:39.745 --> 27:41.224
Do you know where he sold it?

27:41.268 --> 27:43.226
Matter of fact, I do.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.446
Place called...

27:45.489 --> 27:49.276
Barney's Book Barn
right off Route 42
in Allentown.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.581
Allentown, Pennsylvania?

27:50.625 --> 27:52.192
-Yeah.
-Okay.

27:52.235 --> 27:54.629
[laughs] He did pretty well.
This is pretty good.

27:56.979 --> 27:59.199
What the hell
are you looking at now?

27:59.242 --> 28:02.463
Hey, Sarge, we just figured out
why you were so into music
back in the day.

28:02.506 --> 28:05.640
If my music teacher looked
like that, I'd be signing up
to play guitar, too.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.685
[all laugh]

28:06.728 --> 28:07.686
You think you're funny?

28:10.210 --> 28:14.867
If I see this or any other
yearbook in this class,

28:14.910 --> 28:16.433
you're out of my RROTC program.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.914
Am I clear?

28:18.958 --> 28:20.176
Yeah, you're clear.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.221
Sorry.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.849
[cello music playing]

28:49.989 --> 28:51.991
[dramatic music playing]

29:14.665 --> 29:16.798
Very good, Kevin. Well done.

29:16.842 --> 29:20.367
Tried to re-read it,
but to be honest, it made me
sick to my stomach.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.238
Let me guess.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.240
Reminded you of someone
you don't ever
want to be again.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.200
Basically, yeah.

29:27.243 --> 29:30.420
I understand, Kevin, but...

29:30.464 --> 29:34.816
That part of you that feels
that you're unattractive

29:34.860 --> 29:37.732
and undeserving of love,
let it go. Let it die.

29:38.951 --> 29:41.431
You are a gorgeous,
gorgeous man

29:41.475 --> 29:44.565
and you deserve everything
your heart desires.

29:44.608 --> 29:45.827
That's easier said than done.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.047
But it needn't be.

29:48.090 --> 29:52.486
Align yourself with me, and you
need never feel like a...

29:56.055 --> 29:57.056
Piggy again.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.190
How did you know that?

30:01.234 --> 30:05.629
You see, those dark secrets
that we all carry
in our hearts...

30:06.805 --> 30:08.937
I am those secrets, Kevin,

30:10.373 --> 30:12.811
and only I can release you
from them.

30:26.955 --> 30:28.000
Hey.

30:29.784 --> 30:33.788
Hey, I picked us up some
Cucina Sacasa.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.094
I hope you're hungry.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.316
What are you doing
wearing those?

30:40.360 --> 30:41.927
Uh, they're for my migraines.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.624
I got it at the drugstore.
I thought they were cute.

30:43.667 --> 30:44.973
Betty, take those off.

30:45.017 --> 30:45.974
Please take them off.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.846
Okay.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.196
They're off.
What's the problem?

30:50.239 --> 30:53.939
It's Percival. Look, when you
asked if any weird things
happened to me, I lied.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.723
He's bringing back all this
stuff with Ms. Grundy.

30:55.766 --> 30:59.205
It's like everywhere I look,
I see her.

30:59.248 --> 31:01.381
Those glasses,
she wore a pair
exactly like them.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.513
I know it shouldn't...
trigger me.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.254
Uh, yeah, it should.

31:05.298 --> 31:08.605
And he got me thinking
about music and...

31:08.649 --> 31:11.086
how I stopped playing. It was
such a huge part of my life.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.696
And is that because of
Ms. Grundy?

31:12.740 --> 31:14.829
Because every time
I pick up a guitar,

31:14.873 --> 31:17.049
it may send me back to that
music room, back to her.

31:20.617 --> 31:23.664
We didn't really use this word
back then, but the truth is...

31:25.318 --> 31:28.408
she groomed you, Arch.

31:30.323 --> 31:33.282
And that does have
an effect on people.

31:35.415 --> 31:38.026
Percival is bringing up
all these traumas
back to the surface.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.115
Why?

31:40.159 --> 31:42.770
Because it's like Cheryl said,
to hurt you.

31:43.553 --> 31:44.467
Us.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.907
He finds a wound
just so he can press on it.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.694
Jug texted me.

31:53.737 --> 31:56.871
He said he's got a lead on
where he might be able
to find our books.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.568
It's a long shot, but still.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.527
Really? Where?

32:00.570 --> 32:03.225
[exhales] Some book barn in
Pennsylvania.

32:08.404 --> 32:09.405
[kisses]

32:18.980 --> 32:21.069
[instrumental music playing]

32:26.466 --> 32:28.642
I'm glad we both had
a free night to do this.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.166
Get to know each other better.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.126
Without a corpse between us.

32:35.562 --> 32:36.563
I agree.

32:37.564 --> 32:38.565
Cheers, Heraldo.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.138
I do have to ask...

32:48.357 --> 32:49.358
Where is Reggie?

32:50.403 --> 32:52.144
Gone.

32:52.187 --> 32:55.060
For good. God willing.

32:55.103 --> 32:58.628
So what does that make me then?
Am I your rebound?

32:58.672 --> 33:00.369
[chuckles]

33:00.413 --> 33:04.634
I think it's too early to put
a label on this, Heraldo.

33:06.723 --> 33:07.855
But what you are...

33:09.770 --> 33:11.990
is an attractive man

33:13.252 --> 33:15.732
who intrigues me.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.998
And I am a woman who'd rather
not be alone tonight.

33:22.826 --> 33:24.480
Can't it just be as simple
as that?

33:26.917 --> 33:28.049
Whatever you want.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.094
In that case...

33:46.894 --> 33:48.200
[moans]

33:49.331 --> 33:50.506
[exhales]

33:52.117 --> 33:54.597
That was exactly what I needed.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.384
I'm so glad you came over.

34:01.517 --> 34:02.518
Heraldo?

34:06.131 --> 34:07.132
Heraldo?

34:10.222 --> 34:11.223
Heraldo!

34:17.751 --> 34:19.535
[gasps]

34:19.579 --> 34:22.756
Yeah, Reggie, I just want you
to know that I got your gift

34:22.799 --> 34:24.453
and now a man is dead.

34:24.497 --> 34:25.802
Good going, idiot.

34:25.846 --> 34:27.717
Ronnie, what are you
talking about?

34:27.761 --> 34:30.198
Those black widow spiders
in the Glamerge egg
you sent me,

34:30.242 --> 34:33.288
one of them bit Heraldo,
and now he's dead.

34:33.332 --> 34:36.204
Hold on. What was Heraldo doing
at your apartment?

34:36.248 --> 34:37.901
You know exactly what he
was doing.

34:37.945 --> 34:40.034
Ronnie, yeah. I sent you
a Glamerge egg

34:40.078 --> 34:41.905
but there weren't
any spiders in it.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.777
Maybe you just imagined that.

34:43.820 --> 34:46.562
Well, I certainly didn't
imagine the corpse
Betty's bestie

34:46.606 --> 34:48.390
Dr. Curdle just carted
out of here.

34:48.434 --> 34:50.392
Where did you even get that
gauche egg?

34:51.567 --> 34:53.003
The curiosity shop.

34:53.047 --> 34:54.266
[scoffs]

34:55.005 --> 34:56.094
You fool.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.237
Hot off the fax.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.718
We finally have a full,
detailed statement from
TBK's survivor, Katherine.

35:11.761 --> 35:13.198
Oh, great. Anything of note?

35:13.241 --> 35:15.156
No big bombshells.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.115
One weird detail, though.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.117
She mentions that he always
left the light on for her
at night.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.597
Daddy, I'm scared.

35:21.641 --> 35:22.903
Of what, sweetie?

35:22.946 --> 35:25.732
I hear monsters at night
in the house

35:25.775 --> 35:27.299
and in the garage sometimes.

35:28.387 --> 35:29.431
You know what?

35:30.302 --> 35:32.042
I have just the thing.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.180
Well, there you go.

35:39.224 --> 35:42.357
One anti-monster nightlight
to keep you safe.

35:44.664 --> 35:45.882
[clears throat]

35:45.926 --> 35:47.884
But I'll tell you
a secret, Betty.

35:47.928 --> 35:50.104
You don't have to be afraid
of any monster.

35:51.410 --> 35:52.411
Do you know why?

35:54.456 --> 35:59.113
Because you and I are much
scarier than any monster.

36:00.332 --> 36:02.290
Agent Cooper?

36:02.334 --> 36:05.989
We've had TBK's profile wrong
this entire time.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.078
We always assumed
he was a loner,

36:08.122 --> 36:10.342
a drifter leaving a trail
of bodies in his wake.

36:10.385 --> 36:13.040
But what if he has a family
he goes home to?

36:13.083 --> 36:14.737
What if he's a father?

36:14.781 --> 36:17.087
Very few serial killers
have families.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.176
My dad did.

36:19.916 --> 36:22.441
Let's broaden the search
to include fathers,

36:22.484 --> 36:27.141
ones who travel for work,
with a specific focus on
ones who have daughters.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.664
-On it.
-Okay.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.710
[cell phone ringing]

36:32.059 --> 36:33.582
Archie.

36:33.626 --> 36:34.540
[Archie] Betty, Jughead just
texted me.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.367
He's got the books.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.370
Okay.

36:38.413 --> 36:41.503
Ah, Mr. Mantle.
How did the egg go over?

36:41.547 --> 36:42.983
I think you can probably guess.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.027
Oh.

36:44.071 --> 36:45.899
Something funky is going on.

36:45.942 --> 36:49.555
I give you a book
and suddenly I can't read.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.252
I call Veronica a black widow

36:51.296 --> 36:52.993
and then the egg I gave her
is filled with spiders

36:53.036 --> 36:54.734
even though when I checked it,
it was empty.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.303
What are you?

36:59.304 --> 37:00.261
A wizard?

37:01.088 --> 37:02.568
[scoffs]

37:02.611 --> 37:04.744
I mean, I have a trick
or two up my sleeve. I...

37:06.746 --> 37:08.965
I am a... a magic man,
you might say.

37:12.447 --> 37:13.361
Your magic.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.539
Is that something you could
teach me?

37:17.583 --> 37:19.280
Oh, I'm sure we can work
something out.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.894
How... Where did
you find these?

37:24.938 --> 37:27.767
Pennsylvania. A place called
Barney's Book Barn.

37:27.810 --> 37:31.684
It's like Powell's in Seattle,
but they have
literally everything.

37:31.727 --> 37:35.340
Bravo, nerd, who knew
your bookish ways would
one day save us?

37:35.383 --> 37:37.385
So we just go to Percival,
turn over these books

37:37.429 --> 37:38.908
and he gives us
our things back?

37:38.952 --> 37:40.780
-That's what he said.
-He better.

37:40.823 --> 37:43.304
And if he doesn't, we'll burn
down his shop with him in it.

37:43.348 --> 37:46.394
You guys, I don't even know
if I want my father's
portrait back.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.309
That's your choice.

37:48.353 --> 37:50.311
But it would be risky to leave
your totem in Percival's hands.

37:50.355 --> 37:53.967
And speaking of burning...
Once we get our objects back,

37:54.010 --> 37:55.621
we'll have to perform a ritual
with them.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.059
Fair warning.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.103
You're not gonna like it.

38:04.064 --> 38:05.587
Yes.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.502
Those additions
all seem comparable.

38:07.546 --> 38:08.982
Give me a second.
I'll get your items.

38:09.025 --> 38:10.897
Just like that?

38:10.940 --> 38:14.292
Well, fair is fair,
Mr. Andrews. Besides...

38:15.380 --> 38:16.859
They've served their purpose.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.383
What purpose was that?

38:18.426 --> 38:20.515
Collateral, Ms. Cooper.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.604
What other purpose would
I have meant?

38:22.648 --> 38:23.779
Can you just get our things
so we can get the hell
out of here?

38:23.823 --> 38:25.346
Of course.

38:25.390 --> 38:29.785
Oh, um, where's
Kiss of the Spider Woman?

38:29.829 --> 38:31.700
Oh, you can keep
my father's portrait.

38:32.484 --> 38:33.920
I don't need it.

38:33.963 --> 38:36.662
No one has power over me,
not my father

38:36.705 --> 38:38.403
and definitely not you.

38:38.446 --> 38:39.447
Very good.

38:40.579 --> 38:41.623
I'll just get your items.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.453
[guitar strumming]

38:49.283 --> 38:53.026
Getting in one last strum
before we perform
Cheryl's ritual tonight?

38:53.069 --> 38:54.070
Yeah.

38:56.421 --> 38:57.813
How are you doing
with everything?

38:59.772 --> 39:03.036
I'm not sure.

39:03.079 --> 39:07.214
Percival's mind games dislodged
two pretty hardcore memories.

39:08.737 --> 39:11.784
It just made me think that...

39:11.827 --> 39:15.570
I've only just started to
scratch the surface
of what's hidden inside me.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.796
Do we really have to
do this, Cheryl?

39:23.839 --> 39:25.363
[Cheryl] I'm afraid so.

39:25.406 --> 39:26.973
These objects were in
Percival's possession.

39:27.016 --> 39:29.671
Most certainly they've
been polluted.

39:29.715 --> 39:32.631
Tainted by some kind of
dark enchantments.

39:32.674 --> 39:34.720
Cheryl, where's your trunk?

39:34.763 --> 39:36.635
Oh, I already burned Jason.
A second cleansing
is unnecessary.

39:37.505 --> 39:38.898
Shall we begin?

39:38.941 --> 39:40.987
Wait, wait.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.467
Now what?

39:42.510 --> 39:44.338
My grandfather doesn't even
have a headstone.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.688
You could walk over his grave,
not even know it was there.

39:46.732 --> 39:48.995
If I burn this, it's like
he never existed.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.518
I don't care if it's cursed
or hexed.

39:50.562 --> 39:51.824
I'm not... I'm not doing it.

39:51.867 --> 39:53.303
It's a book.
I'm not burning it.

39:53.347 --> 39:54.827
What would Ray Bradbury say?

39:54.870 --> 39:57.090
You all are coo-coo bananas.
But whatevs.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.134
You've been warned.

39:59.092 --> 40:00.093
[exhales]

40:09.798 --> 40:13.236
[Jughead] For those of us
keeping score, we would soon
learn that Percival

40:13.280 --> 40:14.934
had added two soldiers
to his army.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.763
Kevin and Reggie.

40:17.806 --> 40:19.329
Claimed by the dark side.

40:22.289 --> 40:24.639
As for the rest of us,
we'd survived, yes,

40:24.683 --> 40:26.554
and that was a win.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.861
But this week had cost
each of us something.

40:30.732 --> 40:32.125
And every instinct told me

40:32.168 --> 40:35.389
we weren't nearly done
paying yet.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.391
[Veronica] Thank you for
getting back to me, Dr. Curdle.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.958
What's the verdict?

40:39.001 --> 40:42.265
The toxicology report came back
and it was indeed

40:42.309 --> 40:45.312
black widow venom that stopped
Heraldo's heart.

40:45.355 --> 40:46.705
I knew it.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.707
I knew I wasn't
imagining things.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.187
It is interesting, though.

40:51.231 --> 40:54.626
A black widow spider doesn't
typically have enough venom

40:54.669 --> 40:57.455
to kill a grown man.

40:57.498 --> 41:00.893
Well, maybe it was multiple
spiders that bit Heraldo?

41:01.546 --> 41:04.462
Yes.

41:04.505 --> 41:08.814
Except there wasn't
a single puncture mark
anywhere on his body.

41:08.857 --> 41:12.382
Moreover, I have identified
the spot where the venom

41:12.426 --> 41:14.559
entered the young man's body.

41:15.603 --> 41:17.605
Okay. And where is that?

41:17.649 --> 41:19.868
His lips.

41:19.912 --> 41:24.569
His death, it seems
sealed with a kiss.
