WEBVTT

00:45.545 --> 00:47.005
Do you know what time it is?

00:48.631 --> 00:50.175
Don't you have thermodynamics?

00:50.258 --> 00:51.134
Right.

00:51.801 --> 00:55.138
-Right. Yes, class. Yeah.
-Yeah. Late for class again.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.556
So unlike you.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.600
What's gotten into you, Agnes?

00:59.184 --> 01:00.685
I'm a little distracted.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.523
I've been distracted too.

01:07.942 --> 01:10.570
I have to get to class,
stay on the routine.

01:10.653 --> 01:13.198
-See you tomorrow, yeah? Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.699
-Yeah?
-Yep.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.203
See you tomorrow.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.873
-I'll be there.

02:22.183 --> 02:23.560
Give us a smile!

02:23.643 --> 02:25.395
You have a nice day too.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.536
<i> This is</i>
<i>the northbound 6 train.</i>

02:41.619 --> 02:43.580
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

02:51.963 --> 02:55.049
So you're the one who kills baby Hitler.
Impressive.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.635
You know, I never took you
for a murderer, Alan.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.096
You give off
much more of an accomplice vibe.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.473
Thank you, but, uh,
it's a little bit too late for that.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.517
It's 1962 East Germany, so…

03:04.601 --> 03:05.977
Middle of the Cold War.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.397
That's just classic Hitler.
I mean, sabotage freak.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.609
So, what's your endgame?
Where's your long-lost family fortune?

03:12.692 --> 03:14.611
Maybe it's not about fixing anything.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.030
You know, like you said, we leveled up.

03:17.113 --> 03:22.076
Maybe we're just supposed to, like,
I don't know, you know, enjoy the ride.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.621
What's going on with you? Are you high?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.874
No. There's someone in the past that I…

03:28.458 --> 03:30.084
I like spending time with.

03:30.168 --> 03:34.088
So, wh-- what is she?
Is she, like, uh, a Marlene Dietrich type,

03:34.172 --> 03:35.632
or more of an Angela Merkel?

03:35.715 --> 03:36.549
He's--

03:37.091 --> 03:39.135
Okay, okay, his name is Lenny.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.094
Ah.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.679
So a Florian Schneider.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.139
I don't even know who that is.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.724
Kraftwerk. RIP.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.726
Okay, we're not fucking. We're not.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.020
-Well, you're very good at it, Alan.
-Thank you, but--

03:49.103 --> 03:51.940
-Greatest of my life.
-Focus. East Germany…

03:52.774 --> 03:54.943
apparently was a way out, or, uh,

03:55.610 --> 03:57.320
an alternative to Western colonialism,

03:57.403 --> 04:00.365
or just a place
to get educated in the sciences.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.700
My grandmother
was a graduate student from Ghana.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.203
I didn't even know any of this.
I mean, I didn't even know her.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.622
Can you imagine
what she must've lived through?

04:09.040 --> 04:09.874
I mean,

04:11.125 --> 04:13.169
she must've felt so alone.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.339
Sounds like she met somebody, right?

04:18.299 --> 04:20.677
You gonna make a move here, dude?
You're fucking killing me.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.681
I-- I like spending time there. It's…

04:25.306 --> 04:28.268
It's nice not to have to worry
what people think when they see me.

04:28.351 --> 04:32.939
Alan, the only reason to go into the past
is to change shit, all right?

04:33.022 --> 04:34.524
I mean, haven't you ever seen a movie?

04:35.525 --> 04:36.776
Yes, Nadia.

04:36.859 --> 04:40.905
And I know that you won't believe me
when I say this, but I have seen a movie,

04:41.489 --> 04:45.326
and literally every movie about
time travel says don't change things.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.412
That's why this is-- this is so great.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.621
This is…

04:48.705 --> 04:49.706
Nadia.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.208
Nadia, don't-- don't mess this up.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.377
Don't worry. I am done with the '80s.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.547
It turns out it's not all
Cabbage Patch Kids and cocaine.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.382
Check it out, motherfucker.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.508
Checkmate.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.346
All right, gotta do some reconnaissance.
Would you like to join?

05:05.430 --> 05:09.434
No. No, no, no, I have plans. I can't.
I'm meeting with Lenny.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.019
Lenny, you told me, I get it.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.478
I'm happy for you.

05:12.562 --> 05:16.149
-Good day, sir.
-Okay.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.570
Wait, this is wrong. Nadia--
This is a stalemate.

05:20.653 --> 05:21.487
Nad--

05:22.071 --> 05:23.990
Nadia, you're cheating!

05:26.284 --> 05:28.244
-What is this thing?
-Ah.

05:28.328 --> 05:34.125
Hard evidence that my grandmother's family
was looted by Nazis in 1944.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.962
And people don't talk about this much,
but the Nazis were basically broke

05:38.046 --> 05:40.256
and drug-addicted speed freaks.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.591
Read an entire book about it.

05:41.674 --> 05:45.928
The entire Third Reich.
I mean, just blitzed out of their mind.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.847
Sweetheart, that's all common knowledge.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.475
So where did you find this?

05:50.558 --> 05:53.728
Well, in, uh-- You know, in Nora's stuff.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.521
Oh.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.856
I wanna go to Budapest.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.776
Find out what really happened
with this fucking gold train.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.944
-Yay.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.072
This was a plane,
not a Sieg Heil, to be clear.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.031
Ah.

06:05.615 --> 06:09.577
Well, yeah. I mean,
you are turning 40 in a few days,

06:09.660 --> 06:12.580
so I suppose in some way

06:12.663 --> 06:15.416
you were going to get interested
in your family history.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.295
Now, you see,
this is why I love you, Ruthie, okay?

06:19.379 --> 06:20.797
-You get it. Uh…

06:20.880 --> 06:24.717
Yeah, I mean, I guess I wanna go,
I don't know, celebrate my birth

06:24.801 --> 06:27.303
by going back to where all my people died.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.639
Too dark? Ah!

06:29.722 --> 06:31.849
I don't make the rules. That's history.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.393
-Let me ask you a question.

06:33.476 --> 06:38.981
Did you, uh, like, stay in touch much
with Vera after mom died or what?

06:39.065 --> 06:43.611
Your grandmother was a hard person
to know, and…

06:44.278 --> 06:47.073
…I was not exactly her favorite.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.241
Why?

06:48.324 --> 06:51.911
I was an atheist and a heretic,

06:51.994 --> 06:56.874
and she thought that I encouraged
the wrong sides of your mother.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.377
-Atheist and a heretic. That's…

06:59.460 --> 07:01.629
…very hip, Ruthie. Very hip.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.798
What the fuck is this?
What am I looking at?

07:03.881 --> 07:07.093
-What are all these?
-That is nothing for you to worry about.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.428
-Nothing.
-Anything good?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.138
No, nothing at all.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.431
Looks like candy to me.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.432
You know what?

07:12.515 --> 07:15.685
-What?
-Take Maxine to Budapest with you.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.812
-Make a girls' trip out of it.
-Okay.

07:17.895 --> 07:20.022
See, when you're poking around
in the past,

07:20.106 --> 07:22.608
it's helpful to have
a second pair of eyes.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.277
Ah, and a third leg.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.114
What is this?
When did you start smoking menthols?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.283
It's funny.

07:30.992 --> 07:35.621
Lately, I've been thinking
a lot about your mother too.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.343
I thought you were Russian.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.721
Well, my father's family was Russian,

07:51.804 --> 07:54.849
or rather,
temporarily tolerated by the Russians.

07:54.932 --> 07:58.227
My mother's family, same deal,
but with Hungarians.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.190
Fuck, marry, kill.
Hitler, Dracula, Frankenstein.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.608
Too easy.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.110
Three-way with Gary Oldman
and Bela Lugosi,

08:06.194 --> 08:09.739
then I marry Boris Karloff
and I kill Hitler.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.825
Oh my God, we are total opposites.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.120
-Where's our hotel? I got a call--
-Like, you wanna fuck Hitler?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.413
What?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.331
Yeah.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.418
-Do I wanna fuck Hitler?
-Do you?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.421
I'm too tired for this.
Where's our hotel? I'll call an Uber.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.174
Check it out. I wanna go visit
my grandmother's old place.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.384
It's, uh, Dohány Street.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.638
It is 3:00 a.m. in New York, Nemo.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.348
3:00 a.m. is always the point in the night

08:35.431 --> 08:38.476
where we get sad
and try to figure out our families.

08:42.271 --> 08:44.023
Okay, we'll go see your grandma.

08:44.732 --> 08:49.779
You know, my grandmother has also
been talking to me a lot lately too.

08:49.862 --> 08:50.696
Oh really?

08:50.780 --> 08:52.532
Yeah. Lucid dreaming.

08:52.615 --> 08:56.661
Right before you go to sleep,
you slap a nicotine patch right here.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.455
It's a fantastic voyage.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.791
Oh you're "nuts" nuts.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.459
-Yes.
-Look, moving stairs.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.880
This will be interesting.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.177
-Dead men get all the plaques.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.178
Yeah, I know, right?

09:14.262 --> 09:17.223
Like, where are all the memorials
for us living women?

09:17.848 --> 09:19.559
No solicitation!

09:19.642 --> 09:21.352
What the fuck is this?

09:21.852 --> 09:23.479
Ah. Hello.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.022
Bitch!

09:25.106 --> 09:26.566
Also, fuck me!

09:26.649 --> 09:27.775
Yeah?

09:28.276 --> 09:30.111
Looked up some Hungarian curses.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.071
-Oh, that's handy.
-Yeah.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.199
No loitering!

09:35.283 --> 09:38.077
I don't think
that was an invitation to goulash.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.870
I don't like goulash.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.289
I wanna sleep.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.250
With a Hungarian, but first, with myself.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.654
Oh, Agnes, great.
They're inside.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.282
It's okay, Bruno.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.826
She made that schematic.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.203
So this is Agnes, at last.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.248
Yes.
Her German is only so-so still.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.333
She is black.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.294
Yes.
Agnes, this is Bruno and Lukas.

10:28.377 --> 10:31.380
-Hi, hi. I'm Agnes. Yes.
-And the rest of us.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.716
-Okay.
-You made a work of art, Agnes.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.051
What did I make?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.345
We dig
the final five meters tonight,

10:37.845 --> 10:40.097
then wait for Agnes' signal

10:40.181 --> 10:41.932
to break through the cellar floor.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.478
Here, the bakery at Prinzenstraße 13.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.730
Let's use English for Agnes.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.398
Oh right. Sorry.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.860
We're right on schedule
for tomorrow night.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.446
Lenny and I will do the final inspection,

10:55.529 --> 10:59.241
and then the first group of ten
goes through just after midnight.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.410
We rendezvous in the lobby
of Boyd Hall East,

11:01.494 --> 11:04.705
then head down to lab B73
in the basement together.

11:05.331 --> 11:09.251
If anyone asks, we're simply studying
for our engineering exams.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.961
Make sure to carry textbooks.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.214
We'll have to leave
everything else behind.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.467
I'm sorry. What are we doing?

11:16.550 --> 11:18.219
She's joking, right?

11:18.302 --> 11:21.013
Agnes and Petra
will cross over in the morning

11:21.097 --> 11:23.182
through the foreign entry checkpoints

11:23.265 --> 11:25.518
and meet my sister and the other couriers
on Prinzenstraße.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.477
You have a sister?

11:27.061 --> 11:28.396
You know my sister.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.899
Wait, is this…

11:33.567 --> 11:35.653
Is this a tunnel under the Berlin Wall?

11:35.736 --> 11:37.530
-What the fuck?
-What's wrong?

11:37.613 --> 11:39.490
Agnes,
what's going on with you?

11:39.573 --> 11:42.535
-What's wrong with this lady?
-She's not a real Berliner.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.579
These Socialist Project people
are not like us.

11:45.663 --> 11:46.580
We can't trust her.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.040
She may even turn us in.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.250
Don't say that!

11:49.333 --> 11:51.919
We can trust her.
We wouldn't be here without her.

11:52.002 --> 11:55.715
Sorry to interrupt,
but I don't think the train I take here

11:55.798 --> 11:57.007
goes to West Berlin.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.011
Lenny, this is crazy.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.597
We've been digging your tunnel
for six months,

12:03.681 --> 12:05.391
and now you think it's crazy?

12:06.267 --> 12:07.309
What's the new plan?

12:08.519 --> 12:09.353
This?

12:10.062 --> 12:12.481
Enough.
The tunnel will work, okay?

12:15.568 --> 12:16.944
Do you mind if I eat this?

12:35.963 --> 12:37.882
Ah. <i>Kapitány.</i>

12:38.799 --> 12:41.177
"Marton Halász living descendants." Uh…

12:41.260 --> 12:42.178
Ah.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.766
There she is.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.434
Kristóf Halász.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.060
Hey.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.232
Ah.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.570
Yum-yum.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.832
Maxine, look alive. New deal.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.709
No, I'm not done.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.127
Yeah. Try these.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.422
I am not done.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.967
So the Arrow Cross asshole
who signed off on robbing my family

13:22.051 --> 13:26.430
was the last person on record to see
the goods before the trail grows cold.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.224
Only problem is,

13:28.307 --> 13:30.017
like most good Nazis,

13:30.100 --> 13:32.436
Captain Marton Halász is dead.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.855
Yeah, okay.
Are you sure this couldn't be solved

13:34.939 --> 13:37.149
by Lizzy making you a plaque
for your grandma's building?

13:37.233 --> 13:40.110
-Because Lizzy will make you a plaque.
-No, you're missing it, Maxine.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.321
You see,
she doesn't have to make me anything,

13:42.404 --> 13:45.825
because Marton made a son,
who made a son who lives in Budapest,

13:45.908 --> 13:47.409
and is gonna give me all the answers.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.370
I found where he works, where he lives,

13:49.453 --> 13:51.914
what he looks like,
his two most recent ex-girlfriends…

13:51.997 --> 13:53.457
Remind me to get off the Internet.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.459
Too late. Don't worry.
Your nudes are tasteful.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.336
They're not meant to be.

14:01.340 --> 14:05.010
-Can you keep a secret?
-I have lots of practice.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.639
Um…

14:09.557 --> 14:11.809
I know for a fact that that wall

14:12.685 --> 14:14.228
is going to come down.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.106
Don't go.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.693
You'll be reunited
with your family if you just wait.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.069
Oh.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.654
Wait? Mm-hmm.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.573
Until when?

14:25.656 --> 14:28.242
Uh, until 1989.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.160
Fuck.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.372
What game are you playing?

14:34.540 --> 14:37.960
Asking me to wait 27 years
to see my family?

14:39.753 --> 14:41.505
I might as well wait until
I'm a pensioner.

14:41.589 --> 14:45.593
Okay, okay. I-- I hadn't done the math,
and that-- that is a long time,

14:45.676 --> 14:48.804
but it is concrete,

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
risk-free hope for us.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.308
Um…

14:54.268 --> 14:56.020
Isn't it better to just wait until then?

15:01.817 --> 15:03.527
Was Bruno right about you?

15:04.612 --> 15:06.322
-Did you turn us in?
-Of course not.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.908
-You sound like an informant.
-What? No. No, no, no.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.285
Agnes, I understand you're nervous.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.829
I'm nervous, too. Anyone--

15:13.913 --> 15:17.333
No, I have information from the future.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.546
Who knows what's gonna happen
in that tunnel, right?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.382
The tunnel could flood,
or the Stasi will find you.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.594
This is just basic risk analysis, right?

15:28.677 --> 15:31.013
Even if I do stay, what happens to you?

15:32.264 --> 15:35.267
Next year, you get your degree,
you return to Ghana.

15:35.976 --> 15:39.605
Maybe then you make it to Moscow,
or who knows, even New York.

15:41.565 --> 15:45.194
You've said so yourself.
You'll do anything for a better life.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.821
Well, me too.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.785
The problem is
that we have different lives.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.913
Maybe we only

15:57.122 --> 15:58.248
intersect here.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.921
Maybe Nadia was right.
Maybe I am supposed to save you.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.589
I don't need saving.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.174
Who's Nadia?

16:08.425 --> 16:11.095
-Whoa!
-Come on. Just leave it.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.098
I can't take it with me anyway.
Leave. Please.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.394
Sure.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.239
Give us a smile!

16:44.795 --> 16:46.755
Have you
ever heard of place lag?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.258
It's not just time
that screws you up when you travel.

16:49.341 --> 16:53.012
We aren't evolutionarily equipped
to jump 5000 miles overnight.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.681
Our brains can't keep up. I love it.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.641
Time zones, what a concept.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.060
-That's him.
-Holy Willem Dafoe.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.688
Uh, excuse me, Kristóf Halász, yes?

17:03.272 --> 17:05.232
Well, your grandfather
knew my grandmother.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.817
Uh, Vera Peschauer.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.652
-American?
-Yes.

17:08.736 --> 17:12.990
Well, Nadia is half-Hungarian.
She's finding her roots.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.867
I hardly knew my grandfather.

17:14.950 --> 17:18.245
I was never told much about him,
but I can guess why you're here.

17:18.328 --> 17:21.373
He was on the wrong side of history,
and for that, I'm sorry.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.086
I'm having friends over tonight,
so I can't stay. Apologies.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.130
Hold on, I've got more questions.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.591
Uh, did your grandfather
ever mention anything

17:30.674 --> 17:33.177
about what actually happened
on that gold train?

17:33.260 --> 17:36.138
I don't know, did he perhaps keep diaries?

17:36.221 --> 17:39.266
Uh, look, do you know
anything at all about this?

17:40.893 --> 17:42.519
Do you want to come with me?

17:46.774 --> 17:47.649
Case open.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.536
Holy shit.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.288
Who the fuck is this guy?

18:03.332 --> 18:04.458
I'm Kristóf.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.960
All right,
looks like that's Kristóf.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.128
-It's Kristóf.
-Yeah.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.339
-Follow me.
-Okay, officer.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.682
This is what it means
to have friends over in Budapest?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.434
This is the party floor,

18:22.518 --> 18:23.936
if you like to dance.

18:24.686 --> 18:26.855
Is there dancing on other floors?

18:26.939 --> 18:30.150
Uh, different kind of dance.
Of the mind, not the body.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.444
I can take you there if you want.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.906
Just don't lose sight of the silver thread
that tethers you to life.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.033
Uh, heady stuff, man. So listen,

18:38.117 --> 18:41.245
uh, some people think
that some of these, uh, soldiers

18:41.328 --> 18:44.373
secretly looted the train
and kept the goods for themselves.

18:44.456 --> 18:48.794
-What?
-March 1944, before the Soviets invaded?

18:48.877 --> 18:50.838
I thought we were here
to talk about Marton.

18:50.921 --> 18:51.755
Marton?

18:51.839 --> 18:55.175
This moment, this party is all I have.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.177
See? Your friend understands.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.303
Ah.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.347
Are you a musician?

19:01.265 --> 19:03.350
Who, me? No, but I work with sound.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.394
-Oh!
-Jesus Christ.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.688
Let me get you some drinks.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.106
Great. Great.

19:09.606 --> 19:10.858
Fucking waste of time, huh?

19:12.359 --> 19:13.902
You think he'd make a good daddy?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.112
What?

19:15.696 --> 19:19.408
He doesn't have to know. He's very tall,
and he's very far from home.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.202
Yeah,
he's also a Nazi twice removed.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.621
I mean, this is the fall of man
we're talking about.

19:24.705 --> 19:25.998
Yeah, exactly.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.959
He fits right in
with everything I'm trying to say.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.961
Oh my God. You know what? Great.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.672
-Okay, you win. It's probably fine.
-All right, yeah.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.340
You have my blessing.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.426
I don't need it, but it's good to have.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.596
Like a driver's license or a left hand.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.513
Oh.

19:42.055 --> 19:42.890
Thank you.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.141
Congratulations.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.934
-Go make friends.
-Great job.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.270
Fucking shit.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.982
All right, big boy time.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.959
Did Grandma ever talk
to you about Berlin?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.420
Okay, did she ever mention
anybody named Lenny?

20:13.503 --> 20:15.047
I can't find any trace of him online.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.299
She didn't talk much about that time.

20:17.382 --> 20:22.346
So nothing about anybody
that she was seeing at the time, or--

20:23.472 --> 20:26.558
We certainly didn't have
that kind of relationship.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.686
And raising a child
as a single mother in this country

20:29.770 --> 20:33.357
was enough to deal with,
as your grandmother often reminded me.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.858
While I have you,

20:35.442 --> 20:39.947
<i>Emilia mentioned that it's been three days</i>
<i>and you haven't called.</i>

20:40.030 --> 20:41.657
<i>-She thought the date went well.</i>
-I-- I--

20:41.740 --> 20:43.700
I'm sorry, Mom? I gotta go.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.495
Maybe this is exactly
what could've changed for Grandma.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.039
Even if it isn't, I mean, I--

20:49.122 --> 20:50.666
I'm sorry. Never mind.

20:50.749 --> 20:51.875
I'm sorry. I love you.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.632
Downstairs.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.468
Huh.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.097
Some type of fuck-pile scenario.

21:08.558 --> 21:09.393
Eh.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.521
This is where to get it. Fucking weirdo.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.440
Come on, give me something.

21:17.109 --> 21:17.943
Ah.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.654
Some sort of arts and crafts shop.

21:20.737 --> 21:21.863
Great.

21:22.656 --> 21:23.824
Huh.

21:23.907 --> 21:24.741
Knick-knacks.

21:28.745 --> 21:32.499
Well, at least you have
good taste in fashion. Black.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.129
Mother lode.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.922
I fucking knew it.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.009
I fucking knew it.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.471
Blood is thicker, Halász.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.144
Uh…

21:53.645 --> 21:54.479
Okay.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.609
Smile!

22:11.163 --> 22:13.290
B73…

22:19.880 --> 22:20.714
Lenny?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.107
I'm too late.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.003
Right.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.381
Right, right, right.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.424
This fucking guy.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.265
Oh, wait.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.143
-What the fuck?

23:15.227 --> 23:16.103
What are you doing?

23:16.186 --> 23:17.938
You know what we're doing.
What are you doing?

23:18.021 --> 23:20.649
This guy's a fucking
Arrow Cross Nazi, all right?

23:20.732 --> 23:22.901
He's got a room full
of fascist memorabilia.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.361
What did you do to my room?

23:24.444 --> 23:25.904
Look, man, you lied to me.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.697
I just met you. Jesus.

23:27.781 --> 23:31.952
Am I expected to explain
such complexities to a stranger?

23:32.035 --> 23:33.286
"Nice to meet you."

23:33.370 --> 23:36.998
"I grew up with a father who hated
the foundation of his very existence

23:37.082 --> 23:39.459
and was never able to make sense of it."

23:39.543 --> 23:41.086
"Welcome to my party."

23:41.169 --> 23:42.879
Uh-- Uh…

23:42.963 --> 23:45.298
You said you didn't know anything
about your grandfather.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.466
My father dies,

23:46.550 --> 23:49.094
I clean out his house,
and I find my grandfather's things.

23:49.177 --> 23:51.221
Papers, medals, some clothes.

23:51.304 --> 23:52.806
What am I meant to do?

23:52.889 --> 23:56.560
As far as I can tell,
he was a deeply boring and awful man.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.812
You guys have nothing in common, okay?

23:58.895 --> 24:00.605
You-- you're not helping, Maxine.

24:00.689 --> 24:01.940
Look through everything.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.984
Uh, I already did, pal.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.570
I'm offering help, whatever you need.

24:09.698 --> 24:10.532
What is that?

24:12.075 --> 24:13.326
Perspective.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.244
Huh.

24:15.495 --> 24:18.165
Have you ever wanted
to separate from yourself?

24:18.248 --> 24:19.541
I'm only human.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.918
To view yourself with objective distance?

24:22.502 --> 24:25.338
It's coexistence
and lack of existence at once.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.675
Kristóf, you Hungarian god.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.055
We weren't allowed to study LSD.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.642
Acid was deemed too dangerous
for a Communist country.

24:37.726 --> 24:41.271
It was a German chemist
who first synthesized it from Ayahuasca

24:41.354 --> 24:42.814
back in the '50s.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.650
It was actually a Hungarian chemist
who first discovered

24:45.734 --> 24:48.612
the hallucinogenic properties of DMT.

24:52.699 --> 24:55.243
You're also well-known
for the Rubik's Cube.

26:14.698 --> 26:15.699
Where are we?

26:20.870 --> 26:22.622
More like "when" are we.

26:24.874 --> 26:25.792
Hello?

26:29.212 --> 26:30.338
Never mind.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.050
No.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.387
Hmm.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.605
Three, two, one.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.987
Huh.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.493
-Hmm.
-You know him? Mmm?

27:00.619 --> 27:01.953
-Not personally.
-Mmm.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.413
Hmm.

27:03.496 --> 27:06.082
-What's with the rocks?
-It's a Jewish thing.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.459
Putting rocks on graves.

27:07.542 --> 27:10.253
-Oh. Mmm.
-Sign of respect. Yeah.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.547
-You know, like in <i>Schindler's List?</i>
-Sure.

27:12.631 --> 27:18.053
But this guy, uh,
Kiss László, is a priest.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.890
Weird, even for Spielberg.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.516
-Yeah.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.941
So…

27:34.486 --> 27:38.114
I'm sorry I blew your shot
at having a Hungarian Nazi baby.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.699
Yeah, that was fucked up.

27:40.784 --> 27:41.701
It's okay.

27:43.870 --> 27:46.081
I'm sorry you didn't get
what you're looking for.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.377
Should we go find Kristóf?

27:50.460 --> 27:51.586
Nah, fuck it.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.840
Uh, I mean, that guy doesn't have
any more answers for me than I do for him.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.220
Let's go home.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.014
I wanna change everything in my life.

28:03.598 --> 28:04.766
That makes one of us.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.852
I think New York is, uh, east of…

28:07.936 --> 28:10.313
<i> So how'd it go?</i>
<i>Was it a successful trip?</i>

28:10.397 --> 28:12.190
I don't know, Ruthie. I mean,

28:12.774 --> 28:14.651
uh, satiric answers I get.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.529
Tangible ones, not so much.

28:17.612 --> 28:22.659
Honey, we always think that closure
is something we can find

28:22.742 --> 28:24.452
out there in the world,

28:24.536 --> 28:27.288
<i>as if we can find it in another person,</i>

28:27.372 --> 28:30.333
<i>or a confession, or an apology.</i>

28:30.417 --> 28:31.835
See, in the end,

28:32.335 --> 28:34.671
nothing can absolve us but ourselves.

28:35.880 --> 28:40.635
See, that's exactly
what I'm supposed to say.

28:41.469 --> 28:43.179
<i>Lately, oh God,</i>

28:43.263 --> 28:46.975
I've just been wishing
I could tell your mother I'm sorry.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.688
Ruthie, she needed to go
to an institution, yeah.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.566
I mean, she was really fucking sick.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.067
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:56.568 --> 28:58.987
I've just never heard you say that before.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.823
<i>What else did you find</i>
<i>in your mother's stuff?</i>

29:02.449 --> 29:06.035
I don't know, is, uh--
is grief a hot commodity?

29:06.119 --> 29:11.541
Oh God, they hid everything,
your mother and grandmother.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.586
And so much must have been lost.

29:15.086 --> 29:19.174
<i>God, you know,</i>
<i>under floorboards or buried under trees.</i>

29:19.257 --> 29:20.675
<i>Oh God.</i>

29:20.759 --> 29:22.802
Which floorboards?

29:22.886 --> 29:25.764
Oh, long gone.

29:25.847 --> 29:31.269
Trauma is a topographical map
written on the child,

29:31.352 --> 29:33.772
and it takes a lifetime to read.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.900
Darling, come by tomorrow

29:36.983 --> 29:41.154
if you're not sick of backgammon
and Bogart movies by now.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.156
With you, Ruthie,

29:44.115 --> 29:45.158
never.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.117
Bye-bye.

29:49.829 --> 29:50.663
Fuck.

29:51.498 --> 29:54.042
What are we missing? What are we missing?

29:54.542 --> 29:56.336
-Huh?

30:01.716 --> 30:02.801
God, you're good.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.514
One more trip to '82
won't kill us, Oatmeal.

30:59.983 --> 31:04.112
<i> Now arriving</i>
<i>Budapest, Keleti Station.</i>
