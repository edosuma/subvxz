11:03.140 --> 11:06.883
- Well, that's...good?
- It is.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.190
But we're gonna keep him
overnight just to be safe.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.974
- Any word on the victim
he came in with?

11:11.018 --> 11:13.063
- She didn't fare as well.
Her lungs took a hit.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.325
We had to put her
on a ventilator.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.289
- All right, we're
gonna get out of your hair

11:21.332 --> 11:22.333
and let you rest.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.292
You take it easy.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.251
- Um...

11:27.295 --> 11:29.427
Lieutenant,
can I check on Lacey?

11:29.471 --> 11:30.646
- Oh, of course.
Yeah, go.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.039
We'll wait for you.

11:48.272 --> 11:49.447
- You're awake.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.711
- Look at you in your uniform.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.193
[groans]
- Oh, uh, how are you feeling?

11:56.237 --> 11:57.673
- I'm OK.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.763
Dr. Charles told me
you're the one

12:00.807 --> 12:02.765
that found me in the car
after the crash.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.290
He said if it wasn't for you...

12:06.334 --> 12:08.771
- The ambulance got there
pretty quickly

12:08.815 --> 12:10.120
and took over, so...

12:10.164 --> 12:13.689
- Well,
I'm glad you were there.

12:20.827 --> 12:24.091
Blake, I'm really sorry
about all of this.

12:24.134 --> 12:27.747
The accident,
the weird drunk texts, and...

12:31.402 --> 12:34.231
Anyway, now you know

12:34.275 --> 12:36.494
what you've been missing
all these years.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.366
- Hmm.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.023
- I wish
your mom could see you.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.028
She would be so proud.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.816
- I'm--
I'm actually still on shift,

12:53.860 --> 12:55.165
and my lieutenant's
waiting for me downstairs.

12:55.209 --> 12:56.950
- Oh, yeah.
Of course.

12:58.995 --> 13:01.215
- I'll stop by when I'm off.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.390
- OK.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.665
- Hey, Blake.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.536
You got a second
to talk about your aunt?

13:18.580 --> 13:19.886
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.192
- So they have her
on a peripheral nerve blocker

13:22.236 --> 13:25.413
to deal with the post-operative
pain instead of an opiate.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.458
But when she leaves
the hospital,

13:27.502 --> 13:28.851
she's gonna be

13:28.895 --> 13:31.071
in a considerable amount
of discomfort.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.855
- And there's nothing
you can prescribe?

13:32.899 --> 13:34.770
- There's plenty I could
prescribe, but, you know,

13:34.814 --> 13:36.293
she's concerned
about her sobriety,

13:36.337 --> 13:38.905
so she wants
to tough out the pain.

13:38.948 --> 13:41.516
- Well, that seems
a little counterproductive.

13:41.559 --> 13:42.560
Don't you think?

13:42.604 --> 13:43.561
- Pretty common response

13:43.605 --> 13:45.781
from people in recovery.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.565
- I just--

13:47.609 --> 13:49.393
I don't want her to suffer
any more than she has to.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.134
- Well, there is
another option, all right?

13:51.178 --> 13:53.136
You might ask her
if she would be comfortable

13:53.180 --> 13:56.183
with you dispensing
the prescription medications.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.054
You know, you're her nephew.
You're a trained medic.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.403
It's
a pretty common workaround.

13:59.447 --> 14:02.015
So, you know, just give it
a think, all right?

14:02.058 --> 14:04.321
'Cause she's got a tough road
ahead of her.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.845
- OK. Thank you.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.020
- You bet.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.243
- I wrote them up
at least twice back

14:13.287 --> 14:15.071
when I was a battalion chief,

14:15.115 --> 14:17.291
but they are still
storing massive quantities

14:17.334 --> 14:20.076
of hazardous material
in a residential building.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.599
I'm here to find out why.

14:21.643 --> 14:25.690
- Chief, I get
that you're mad about this.

14:25.734 --> 14:29.825
And if you did report them,
I assure you, we followed up.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.913
- Then why are
they still at it?

14:30.957 --> 14:32.045
- I don't know.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.438
But we take every
violation seriously.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.962
- If that were the case,
I wouldn't have

14:36.005 --> 14:38.747
a firefighter and a victim
in the hospital

14:38.790 --> 14:41.141
with chemical burns right now.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.667
- Hell, I--

14:45.710 --> 14:48.017
I'm sorry, Chief.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.498
Are they gonna be OK?

14:53.414 --> 14:55.982
- God willing.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.722
But we wouldn't be
asking this question

14:57.766 --> 14:59.942
if you'd have done your job.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.944
- I'll get to the bottom of it.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.511
What's that address?

15:03.554 --> 15:05.165
- 3958 South Pershing.

15:05.208 --> 15:08.342
Loomis Industrial Supply.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.868
What is it?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.522
You know the place?

15:17.177 --> 15:21.485
Look, Director Valencia.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.923
I'm not leaving your office
without answers.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.058
- OK.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.494
But you gotta close the door.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.985
- OK, this one's
a little simpler.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.726
Upside-down water bottle trick.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.858
What do you think?

15:46.902 --> 15:48.773
- Simple, but messy.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.253
- Well, then I have nothing.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.429
I can't find one trick
that I can learn by Saturday.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.779
- You did
the floating card one earlier.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.304
- The card never levitated.

15:57.347 --> 15:58.348
Of all the weekends
Dylan's brother

15:58.392 --> 15:59.784
could have
dragged him out of town.

15:59.828 --> 16:02.004
- FaceTime him and have him
walk you through one.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.006
- I don't want to interrupt him
on his trip.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.355
Plus, we could use the space.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.357
- What?
You guys seem great together.

16:07.401 --> 16:10.360
- We do, but I'm still
kind of finding my footing

16:10.404 --> 16:13.015
after Hurricane Matt blew in
through town without warning.

16:16.497 --> 16:17.889
Hey, how's Carver?

16:17.933 --> 16:20.153
- Oh, he's fine,
the faker.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.458
Minor burn of the trachea.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.025
- Ouch.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.071
- Mm, Brett, you got a sec?
- Sure.

16:25.114 --> 16:28.291
- Hey, I talked
to Dr. Charles at Med,

16:28.335 --> 16:30.032
and he said
Lacey's not accepting

16:30.076 --> 16:31.338
anything stronger
than ibuprofen.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.167
- Sobriety concerns?
- Yeah.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.777
- Brett and I run into this
a lot actually.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.866
- I figured.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.042
Any advice?

16:40.086 --> 16:42.001
- Best thing you can do is

16:42.044 --> 16:44.133
come up with a treatment plan
with her.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.266
Given those injuries,
that acute post-surgical pain

16:46.309 --> 16:48.355
is gonna kick her ass.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.226
- Yeah.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.054
- Maybe you should talk to her,

16:52.098 --> 16:54.883
let her know
you're there to support her.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.755
Look, either she's gonna have
to suffer through the pain

16:57.799 --> 17:01.237
or she's gonna take the meds
and wrestle with her addiction.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.457
Either way,
she's gonna need help.

17:06.415 --> 17:08.896
- OK, uh, just pick a card.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.986
Yeah.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.597
- [sighs]
- OK.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.209
OK, now put it back
in the deck.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.342
OK, and everyone can see

17:19.386 --> 17:22.824
that Cruz's card is completely
lost in the deck, right?

17:22.867 --> 17:23.867
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.609
- OK, so...

17:27.829 --> 17:29.091
OK.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.746
Yeah, OK.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.922
Ah.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.793
Was your card
the ten of hearts?

17:35.837 --> 17:38.057
- [chuckles] No.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.102
- Shoot.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.278
- Hey, Chief,
how'd it go downtown?

17:42.322 --> 17:45.064
- Not good.
What's the word on Carver?

17:45.107 --> 17:46.891
- Looks like
he's gonna be OK.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.241
Little damage to the throat,

17:48.284 --> 17:49.851
but not enough
to keep him quiet.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.983
- Ha!
- What happened?

17:52.027 --> 17:53.289
You read them the riot act?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.335
- Yeah,
not that it did me any good.

17:55.378 --> 17:58.773
That chemical company has got
a guardian angel somewhere.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.558
Every time they get caught
in a violation,

18:01.602 --> 18:03.517
the investigating agency
gets pushback

18:03.560 --> 18:05.040
from someone up the food chain.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.476
- Well, that's disgusting.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.131
- Well, what do we do
to find this guardian angel?

18:09.175 --> 18:11.655
- The company supplies pool
cleaning chemicals to the city,

18:11.699 --> 18:14.136
so it's probably someone
involved with city contracts.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.008
But whoever it is
must have some real juice.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.794
Valencia thinks it goes all the
way up to the city treasurer,

18:19.837 --> 18:22.057
but I don't know.
- [coughs]

18:22.101 --> 18:25.930
The treasurer
as in Don Ramsey?

18:25.974 --> 18:28.542
- Yep, but I don't buy it.

18:28.585 --> 18:32.198
Ramsey seems like
a decent enough guy, right?

18:32.241 --> 18:33.808
- Chief, there's something
I gotta tell you.

18:41.294 --> 18:41.685
.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.557
- The fire was hardly anything.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.732
We never even had
to stretch a hose.

18:44.775 --> 18:47.256
But after,
in my sweep of the building,

18:47.300 --> 18:49.911
I came across Don Ramsey
hiding in a closet

18:49.954 --> 18:52.609
with a woman
who was not his wife,

18:52.653 --> 18:54.785
and they were
both half-dressed.

18:54.829 --> 18:58.006
- Hang on. Are you talking
about the artist lady?

18:58.049 --> 19:00.617
'Cause you told me
that you didn't get the name

19:00.661 --> 19:02.271
of the guy
that you saw her with.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.230
- Which was technically true.

19:04.273 --> 19:07.189
I didn't realize
who he was until later.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.713
But the point is,

19:09.757 --> 19:11.498
he was scared
I was gonna rat him out,

19:11.541 --> 19:12.977
so he started
keeping tabs on me,

19:13.021 --> 19:14.675
making all kinds of threats.

19:14.718 --> 19:15.850
- What kind of threats?

19:15.893 --> 19:18.026
- My job, my lieutenant's job.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.857
He said he'd come
after the whole firehouse.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.599
- And you decided to take
the fate of this firehouse

19:25.642 --> 19:27.514
into your own hands?

19:27.557 --> 19:30.212
- It just felt like something

19:30.256 --> 19:33.041
I had to handle one on one,
so I did.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.348
- You shouldn't have
kept me in the dark.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.350
And you don't ever lie
to your lieutenant.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.221
- It wasn't my intention to.

19:42.572 --> 19:46.620
I was just trying not to make
waves for Lieutenant Herrmann.

19:47.273 --> 19:50.014
He and Cindy were
in the thick of it,

19:50.058 --> 19:53.061
and I just didn't want
to add to his stress.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.021
- Continue.

20:00.111 --> 20:04.072
- Anyway, in the course
of that whole mess,

20:04.115 --> 20:07.771
I got a real unvarnished look
at Don Ramsey.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.644
He's a sketchy dude.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.341
A liar, a cheat.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.952
Perfectly willing to use
the powers of his office

20:14.996 --> 20:16.563
in a personal vendetta.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.260
The guy basically stalked me

20:18.304 --> 20:20.393
using his connections
to the CFD.

20:20.436 --> 20:23.222
- So he's more than willing
to use his position

20:23.265 --> 20:24.614
for personal gain.

20:24.658 --> 20:27.008
That could include payouts.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.053
- Ramsey has gotten
a lot of ink

20:29.097 --> 20:31.360
for how he's managed to turn
the city's finances around.

20:31.404 --> 20:35.103
Maybe the secret to his success
is giving out illicit contracts

20:35.146 --> 20:38.062
to shady companies
who cut corners,

20:38.106 --> 20:39.934
like Loomis Industrial Supply.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.544
- He's the city treasurer,
Chief.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.895
I mean, how do you go
after a guy like that head-on?

20:44.939 --> 20:47.768
- Well, maybe we need
to move this up the chain.

20:47.811 --> 20:50.292
DC Hill is a good place
to start.

20:50.336 --> 20:55.123
She is a political animal,
but she knows right from wrong.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.213
- Kylie!

20:59.997 --> 21:02.043
Call DC Hill's office.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.524
See how fast you can
get a meeting on the books.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.134
- I'm on it, Chief.
- All right.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.225
OK.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.150
- Hey.

21:23.934 --> 21:26.197
I'm really sorry, Lieutenant.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.983
- I appreciate you keeping
an eye out for me, Ritter,

21:29.026 --> 21:33.379
but you don't have
to protect me from bad news.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.250
I can handle it.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.295
- It won't happen again.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.999
- Was your card
the ten of diamonds?

21:45.042 --> 21:46.870
- Almost.
Eight of hearts.

21:48.350 --> 21:52.267
Also, you're dropping cards
all over the firehouse.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.355
- Oh.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.056
Hey, Capp.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.797
[stammering]
Oh, come on.

22:00.841 --> 22:03.147
Just let me try it on you
one more time.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.324
- I blame myself.
I encouraged her.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.369
- Those poor kids.
That show is gonna blow.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.631
- [laughing]

22:08.675 --> 22:11.373
- Hey, thank you for yesterday.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.549
I think I know a way
that I can support her,

22:13.593 --> 22:14.681
but I could use your help.

22:14.724 --> 22:18.119
- Yeah, whatever you need.
- Cool.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.816
- I've been asking around
to some of the folks

22:19.860 --> 22:22.732
who worked with Ramsey
when he was with the CFD.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.517
The more I learn about the man,

22:24.560 --> 22:27.911
the more certain I am
that it has to be him.

22:27.955 --> 22:31.393
I'm just asking you,
what's the best approach here?

22:31.437 --> 22:34.353
- If I were you,
I'd file an anonymous complaint

22:34.396 --> 22:36.746
with
the inspector general's office.

22:36.790 --> 22:40.271
Then I'd go back to my district
and forget the whole thing.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.840
- An anonymous complaint
won't move the needle.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.712
If Don Ramsey is responsible

22:45.755 --> 22:47.235
for those
illegally stored chemicals,

22:47.278 --> 22:50.238
he has to answer for it.
- If he's responsible.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.545
But you have
no concrete proof of that.

22:52.588 --> 22:56.375
- That's why we need
an investigation to find proof.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.247
- We're talking about one
of the most powerful people

22:59.290 --> 23:00.727
in Chicago.

23:00.770 --> 23:03.686
A man who could bust us
both down to battalion chief

23:03.730 --> 23:04.948
with a single phone call.

23:04.992 --> 23:08.343
And that's if he wants
to go easy on us.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.955
Chief,
without any hard evidence,

23:11.999 --> 23:13.392
you got nothing.

23:16.264 --> 23:20.660
- So I'm supposed to just...

23:20.703 --> 23:22.270
forget about it?

23:23.445 --> 23:27.406
- You don't take a shot at the
king unless you can kill him.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.147
- Mm.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.850
- Joyce is looking pretty good,
don't you think?

23:36.893 --> 23:39.461
Maybe we bump her down
to biweekly visits.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.507
- I am never gonna land this,
am I?

23:41.550 --> 23:44.423
I could have sworn
she had the five of spades.

23:44.466 --> 23:47.295
- Hey,
she has early-onset dementia.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.776
She probably didn't remember
what her card even was.

23:49.819 --> 23:52.605
- I can't believe
I agreed to do this.

23:52.648 --> 23:53.997
- It's the clap.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.478
You're missing the clap.

23:56.522 --> 23:57.610
- The clap?

23:57.653 --> 23:59.481
What's that?

23:59.525 --> 24:01.788
- This...

24:01.831 --> 24:05.095
is an abomination to magic.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.358
[sighs]

24:14.104 --> 24:16.672
Now on three, clap.

24:16.716 --> 24:20.197
One, two, three.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.203
I distracted you
when you clapped your hands.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.249
It's the secret sauce
to the trick.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.686
That one, you get for free.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.427
- Oh, Mouch, you have
to help me on Saturday.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.124
These kids
are gonna eat me alive.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.953
- Toughest crowds are kids,
Brett.

24:36.997 --> 24:38.651
- No, please.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.914
Please, don't make me beg.

24:44.352 --> 24:45.222
- Fine.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.529
But learn the basics first.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.663
Number one:
there's no such thing as magic.

24:50.706 --> 24:51.881
Just illusion.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.410
- The flower is a nice touch.

24:59.454 --> 25:00.934
- Thanks.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.326
- I guess
all those hours of HGTV

25:02.370 --> 25:05.068
didn't go to waste after all.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.331
It's nice of you
to give up your bed for Lacey.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.333
It sure beats
recovering at a hotel.

25:09.377 --> 25:11.031
- We'll see. I mean,
I haven't had a chance

25:11.074 --> 25:12.989
to run it by her yet.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.469
- Post-op recovery is no joke.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.863
She's very lucky
you're doing this for her.

25:16.906 --> 25:18.125
- Yeah.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.524
- Hey, what's that look about?

25:28.962 --> 25:30.572
- It doesn't take
a psychiatrist

25:30.616 --> 25:33.053
to know
why I'm in this line of work.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.358
I pretty much
spent my whole life

25:34.402 --> 25:37.492
trying to go back
and save my sister.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.407
- Aw, Blake.
- No, it's delusional.

25:39.450 --> 25:42.932
I know.
I can't help it, but...

25:44.760 --> 25:47.589
The other night, when
I pulled Lacey out of that car,

25:47.633 --> 25:52.551
that was the first save
I've ever felt, like,

25:52.594 --> 25:57.207
even just a little bit
of, like, redemption.

25:58.687 --> 26:01.777
So I'm not sure
if I'm doing this for her

26:01.821 --> 26:04.650
or if it's for me.

26:04.693 --> 26:07.435
- It doesn't matter
why you're doing it.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.132
This is a kindness
that could change

26:09.176 --> 26:11.047
the whole trajectory
of her life.

26:14.964 --> 26:18.228
Come on.
Let's clear out all the booze.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.013
- [exhales sharply]

26:21.405 --> 26:23.886
We're gonna need a bigger box.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.148
- [giggles]

26:25.192 --> 26:27.847
- Um, my wife ordered online.

26:27.890 --> 26:30.284
Name's Boden.
- One second.

26:30.327 --> 26:34.897
- Boden, as in Wallace Boden?
Don Ramsey.

26:34.941 --> 26:39.162
We met a few years back
at one CFD event or another.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.948
- Yeah, sure.

26:41.991 --> 26:45.299
Do you, uh--
you live around here?

26:45.342 --> 26:48.345
- No, but I'll always
go out of my way for Manny's.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.654
Hey, you're
at Firehouse 51 still, right?

26:52.698 --> 26:54.569
I heard one of your guys
got hurt yesterday.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.049
Not too bad, I hope.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.791
- He's recovering.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.707
- Good. Good.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.360
My days with the CFD
are behind me,

27:03.404 --> 27:05.536
but I'll always have a soft
spot for our firefighters.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.321
- Mm.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.366
- I know
that might sound insincere

27:09.410 --> 27:12.195
given
all the recent budget cuts.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.328
But hey, now that
we're making our numbers,

27:14.371 --> 27:15.721
I could probably
loosen the purse strings

27:15.764 --> 27:18.593
and find some extra funding
for your district.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.813
If that would help.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.075
- Here you go.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.555
- Ah, thank you.

27:24.599 --> 27:29.430
Um, you know, I got bigger
concerns than budget cuts,

27:29.473 --> 27:31.432
like the fact that
someone in city government

27:31.475 --> 27:34.522
is skirting regulations and
putting firefighters at risk.

27:36.785 --> 27:39.092
I'm gonna take them down.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.574
Enjoy your meal, Mr. Treasurer.

27:52.366 --> 27:52.714
.

27:52.758 --> 27:55.674
[monitors beeping]

27:57.980 --> 28:00.548
- You guys really start early,
don't you?

28:00.591 --> 28:01.723
- Not always this early.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.856
I have to go to the store
and make sure

28:03.899 --> 28:06.989
I have enough bacon for
a dozen hungry firefighters.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.818
- You kept up
with your cooking, huh?

28:09.862 --> 28:11.341
You always had a knack for it.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.735
- Well, I had a good teacher.
- [chuckles]

28:13.779 --> 28:15.737
You remember when I taught you

28:15.781 --> 28:17.783
how to make
baked mac and cheese?

28:17.826 --> 28:20.133
- Oh.
[both laugh]

28:20.176 --> 28:23.005
And I dumped, what was it,
two pounds of macaroni

28:23.049 --> 28:24.659
all over the stovetop?
- Oh, God.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.270
You turned beet red.
It was so cute.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.056
- Hey, um...

28:33.363 --> 28:35.714
I know you're worried
about abusing your pain meds

28:35.757 --> 28:39.021
when you're discharged,
but don't be.

28:39.065 --> 28:42.198
I want to be there to support
you every step of the way.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.852
- Oh,
you've done plenty already.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.420
Don't get caught up in my mess.

28:46.463 --> 28:48.639
- You can't do it alone, Lacey.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.293
So you're gonna stay with me.

28:50.337 --> 28:51.730
I already have everything
set up for you.

28:51.773 --> 28:55.690
- No, Blake, after everything,
that's not fair.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.997
I can't be a burden to you.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.303
- You're not a burden to me.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.261
You're family.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.407
- What the hell?

29:17.451 --> 29:19.235
Does he got a tracker
on your car or something?

29:19.279 --> 29:21.063
- Probably followed me
from my house.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.891
All I know is,
it was no coincidence.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.763
- That's creepy.
- How did he find out

29:24.806 --> 29:25.807
that you were gunning for him?

29:25.851 --> 29:28.810
I mean,
did DC Hill rat you out?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.377
- No way.
- I asked a few people

29:30.420 --> 29:31.595
about him
when I was at HQ.

29:31.639 --> 29:32.509
I should have
been more careful.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.033
- Yeah, one thing I learned,

29:34.076 --> 29:36.165
Ramsey's still
got connections in the CFD.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.906
- How he knows
doesn't really matter.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.821
The point is, he knows.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.431
- Yeah,
but he's tipped his hand too.

29:41.475 --> 29:43.520
Now we know we're barking up
the right tree.

29:43.564 --> 29:44.957
- Yes.
- But we still need proof.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.524
So what'd you find out
about that company?

29:47.568 --> 29:48.656
- I did some digging.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.832
Just public records,
stuff like that.

29:50.876 --> 29:53.792
Loomis Industrial Supply
is owned by a holding company

29:53.835 --> 29:56.185
called McGrath-Hewitt LLC.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.926
They own a bunch of companies,
and they all seem

29:57.970 --> 29:59.710
to work
under city contracts--

29:59.754 --> 30:02.104
office supplies,
printing services,

30:02.148 --> 30:04.063
auto parts for city vehicles.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.456
- So this is bigger
than one contract.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.111
There could be a whole network
of shady companies out there

30:09.155 --> 30:10.983
just cutting corners for him.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.898
- And if we can link Ramsey
to any of them,

30:12.941 --> 30:14.856
that connects him
to all of them.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.858
- What kind of a link
are we looking for?

30:16.902 --> 30:20.731
- I don't know. If he has
a financial interest or...

30:20.775 --> 30:23.343
If they contributed to his
campaign, that might be enough.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.171
- I'll get Kylie on that.
- All right.

30:25.214 --> 30:27.956
Meantime,
why don't we take a look

30:28.000 --> 30:29.697
at some of these places,
see what we can find?

30:29.740 --> 30:33.092
- And what, just start knocking
on doors asking questions?

30:33.135 --> 30:34.833
- Random inspections,
you know,

30:34.876 --> 30:37.313
looking
for fire code violations.

30:37.357 --> 30:40.186
Just pop in, peek behind
the curtain, see what's what.

30:40.229 --> 30:42.144
- Yeah, it's better
than sitting on our hands

30:42.188 --> 30:44.494
waiting for Ramsey
to come after us.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.496
- Yeah.
- OK.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.847
But keep a low profile.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.805
- Low profile's my middle name.

30:52.807 --> 30:55.244
- OK, now put your card
back in the deck.

30:57.203 --> 31:00.206
OK, on the count of three,
I want you to clap.

31:00.249 --> 31:03.035
One, two, three.

31:04.732 --> 31:07.387
And was this your card?

31:07.430 --> 31:09.128
- Oh, incredible.

31:09.171 --> 31:10.999
- Oh!
- [squeals]

31:11.043 --> 31:14.002
- Patience,
persistence, performance.

31:14.046 --> 31:14.960
- Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

31:15.003 --> 31:16.918
Was this really your card?

31:16.962 --> 31:19.181
- It's the right suit.
- [whimpers]

31:19.225 --> 31:21.096
- I'm sorry. It's just
you were giving it your all.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.229
I felt bad.
- [sighs]

31:23.272 --> 31:25.231
- 81, mount up.

31:25.274 --> 31:26.710
We're gonna go sniff
around a few companies

31:26.754 --> 31:28.364
that might be affiliates
of Ramsey's.

31:28.408 --> 31:29.365
- Hell yes.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.108
Rome wasn't built in a day,

31:33.152 --> 31:36.329
and Harry didn't
become Houdini overnight.

31:38.331 --> 31:39.941
[sighs]

31:47.906 --> 31:50.647
- Oh, boy, every one
of these companies

31:50.691 --> 31:52.301
is even shabbier
than the last one.

31:56.001 --> 31:59.221
Fire hazard, OSHA violation.

31:59.265 --> 32:00.614
- I mean,
they all look fly-by-night,

32:00.657 --> 32:03.573
like they only exist
to service these contracts.

32:03.617 --> 32:06.402
- Help you guys?
- Yeah, CFD.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.274
Popping in
for a quick inspection.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.711
- Oh, man. Really?
- Yeah.

32:10.754 --> 32:14.541
I can already see that you guys
got some issues to address.

32:14.584 --> 32:17.065
Is the owner around?
- The owner is Mr. McGrath.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.849
He's not really
the hands-on type.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.982
But his sister dropped by
to do the books.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.810
You want to talk to her?
- Yeah, thanks.

32:22.853 --> 32:25.073
- Yo, Tanya!

32:25.117 --> 32:28.381
- That'd be McGrath
of McGrath-Hewitt LLC.

32:28.424 --> 32:31.166
"Not really the hands-on type."
- Yeah.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.560
Hey, how great would it be

32:33.603 --> 32:36.911
if they were printing up
Don Ramsey campaign flyers?

32:36.955 --> 32:39.131
[both laugh]

32:43.831 --> 32:45.964
- Hey, how do I know her?

32:46.007 --> 32:47.182
- That's the lady
from the art studio.

32:47.226 --> 32:48.705
Herrmann,
we gotta get out of here.

32:48.749 --> 32:50.316
That's Don Ramsey's mistress.

32:50.359 --> 32:51.621
- Copy that, Main.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.101
51 on the way.

32:53.145 --> 32:54.581
- Can I help you, gentlemen?

32:54.624 --> 32:56.583
- No, we just caught
a house fire, ma'am.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.977
Sorry to bother you.
You're off the hook.

33:05.635 --> 33:07.159
- You think
she recognized you?

33:07.202 --> 33:08.638
- The two of us together
in our bunker gear?

33:08.682 --> 33:09.813
Pretty good chance.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.467
- So much
for keeping a low profile.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.513
- I know, Chief,
but this is a lock.

33:13.556 --> 33:16.124
We now know for sure
that Ramsey is in bed

33:16.168 --> 33:17.778
with
the McGrath-Hewitt companies

33:17.821 --> 33:20.172
because he's literally in bed
with McGrath's sister, Tanya.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.739
- OK, so how do we use this?

33:22.783 --> 33:24.176
- Look.

33:24.219 --> 33:27.092
If you are willing to go
on record about the affair--

33:27.135 --> 33:29.094
- I am.
- Maybe we can use that

33:29.137 --> 33:30.312
to shore up
the case against Ramsey.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.401
Go back to Director Valencia
and DC Hill,

33:32.445 --> 33:33.750
and we see
if we get 'em on board.

33:33.794 --> 33:35.839
- What about a reporter?

33:35.883 --> 33:38.320
We give them the scoop,
and we see if they run with it.

33:38.364 --> 33:39.843
- Good. Yes.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.889
- Chief, sorry to interrupt,

33:41.932 --> 33:45.240
but Don Ramsey's office
is on the line.

33:45.284 --> 33:47.373
He'd like to meet with you.

34:04.694 --> 34:04.912

34:04.955 --> 34:06.696

Wallace Boden.

34:06.740 --> 34:07.958
Here to see Don Ramsey.

34:08.002 --> 34:10.570
- Yes, Chief.
Thank you for coming.

34:10.612 --> 34:12.353
Chief Boden is here, sir.

34:14.748 --> 34:18.578

thanks so much for coming.

to say to me, say it.

34:23.887 --> 34:26.455
- Chief,
why don't you come inside?

34:35.116 --> 34:37.945
Folks, this is the man
I've been telling you about.

34:37.987 --> 34:41.514
Deputy District Chief
Wallace Boden of the CFD.

34:41.556 --> 34:43.168
We have him to thank
for rooting out

34:43.210 --> 34:45.822
this corrupt enterprise that's
been siphoning our tax dollars

34:45.866 --> 34:48.476
and putting our citizens
and first responders at risk.

34:48.521 --> 34:49.870
- What the hell is this?

34:49.913 --> 34:51.045
You think I can be bought?
- I'm sorry.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.568
I didn't mean
to ambush you like this.

34:52.612 --> 34:53.960
I know you don't do this
for the accolades,

34:54.004 --> 34:55.614
but you deserve them
nonetheless.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.225
Because of you,
we're gonna review

34:57.269 --> 34:58.487
all current city contracts

34:58.531 --> 35:00.794
and clean up
this sort of corruption.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.012
Because what happened
to your firefighter

35:02.056 --> 35:03.753
is never gonna happen again
on my watch.

35:03.797 --> 35:05.146
I promise you that.

35:05.190 --> 35:08.454
[applause]

35:13.285 --> 35:14.851
Boden.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.157
- I don't know what you think
you're doing here--

35:16.201 --> 35:18.159
- I'm letting you
be the hero, Boden.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.640
You want to blow this all up?
Go ahead.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.598
Make a scene,
file your complaints,

35:22.642 --> 35:25.688
try to take me down
if you think you can.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.951
But if I were you,
I'd take the win.

35:27.995 --> 35:29.562
We're gonna shut down
all those companies,

35:29.605 --> 35:32.173
clean up
the whole contract process.

35:32.217 --> 35:35.655
Isn't that what you wanted?
To make the city safer?

35:42.314 --> 35:45.447
- OK, and now,

35:45.491 --> 35:48.494
the Astonishing Sylvie
will perform

35:48.537 --> 35:51.061
"The Vanishing Milk Trick."

35:53.020 --> 35:55.805
- As you can see,
I have a glass of milk.

35:55.849 --> 35:58.982
And now, I'm going
to very carefully

35:59.026 --> 36:01.159

into the newspaper.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.471
Hmm...

36:09.515 --> 36:11.038

36:12.387 --> 36:14.824
Voilà.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.893
- In a faraway land,

36:39.936 --> 36:44.985
an evil magician named Gorsch
used his magic powers

36:45.028 --> 36:49.207
to curse good-hearted magicians
like The Astonishing Sylvie.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.686
- What are you doing?
You're going rogue.

36:50.730 --> 36:54.473
- But if the curse
causes Sylvie to fail,

36:54.516 --> 36:57.127
fear not!

36:57.171 --> 36:58.738
Candy for everyone!

36:58.781 --> 37:02.655

37:16.277 --> 37:19.193

37:21.978 --> 37:25.155
Really? I did it!
- Oh!

37:25.199 --> 37:27.245
I did it.
And you didn't think I could.

37:27.288 --> 37:29.812

for every contingency.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.510

in here moved to another room?

37:54.533 --> 37:56.186

- Yeah.

37:56.230 --> 37:58.624
- She was discharged
a few hours ago.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.802
- Are you sure? I'm supposed
to be picking her up.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.413
- Yeah, I have her
discharge summary right here.

38:05.457 --> 38:06.893
I'm sorry.

and a peace offering.

38:27.217 --> 38:29.002
- Hmm.

38:29.045 --> 38:32.397
- Brett, that was a hell
of a show you put on.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.920
Dylan's gonna be proud.

38:33.963 --> 38:35.748

38:35.791 --> 38:37.967
- Well,
here's to hoping you didn't.

38:38.011 --> 38:41.362
And, uh, drink slowly.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.454
Does Herrmann--

38:46.498 --> 38:48.021
- No.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.936
- When I ran for office,

38:49.979 --> 38:52.504
this was the exact type
of waste and fraud

38:52.547 --> 38:54.375
that I promised to stamp out.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.116
And I keep my promises.

38:56.159 --> 38:58.292
- That is one punchable face.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.946
- We've already
voided the contract

38:59.989 --> 39:01.643
for Loomis Industrial Supply

39:01.687 --> 39:02.949
and are moving
to press charges

39:04.472 --> 39:06.953

storing those chemicals.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.346
And that's just the beginning.

Instead,
he's doing a victory lap.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.009
- Hey, Chief.

39:20.053 --> 39:22.142
You played this
the only way you could.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.578
And we got what we were after.

39:23.622 --> 39:27.539
- So why do I have
such a bad taste in my mouth?

39:27.582 --> 39:29.758
- I gotta be honest, Chief.

39:29.802 --> 39:32.979
I'm impressed
with your restraint.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.502
- Deputy Commissioner.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.678
- I thought you might
knock Ramsey on his ass

39:36.722 --> 39:39.202
and get yourself arrested.

39:39.246 --> 39:43.032
- Well, I guess I'm mellowing
in my old age.

39:43.076 --> 39:44.382
- No, that's not it.

39:44.425 --> 39:47.733
You're just learning
the politics of this job.

39:47.776 --> 39:49.909
Finally.

39:49.952 --> 39:52.390

to feel this awful?

39:52.433 --> 39:54.392
- Every time.

39:58.961 --> 40:00.615
- It's been
a back and forth battle

40:00.659 --> 40:02.225

40:02.269 --> 40:04.314

to hold onto the lead.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.273
What does Philly have to do
to get back in this game?

40:06.316 --> 40:09.319
- Well, they need to start
locking down their shots.

40:17.458 --> 40:20.287

to dump all my beer.
