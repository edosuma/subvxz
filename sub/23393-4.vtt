01:16.451 --> 01:17.535
Nick?

01:19.537 --> 01:20.622
Nick.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.417
-Hey!
-Yeah. Oh, shit.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.794
Did I fall asleep?

01:26.419 --> 01:28.630
Yeah, we both must have dozed off.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.299
That was amazing.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.885
-You are...
-Yeah, you too.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.762
-Time to go.
-...amazing.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.472
Come on, time to go.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.432
Come on, up and at 'em.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.105
-Yes, come on. Come on.

01:46.189 --> 01:50.318
And go all the way downstairs
and have my chauffeur take me home?

01:50.401 --> 01:53.738
Your struggle is an inspiration
to all of us.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.615
Here are your Gucci loafers.

01:56.908 --> 01:57.784
God...

01:58.827 --> 02:01.204
how do you always manage
to look so great?

02:01.329 --> 02:03.248
Oh, please.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.125
I just woke up.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.043
I must look like hell.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.839
We can still call it "casual"
and have the occasional sleepover.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.341
They call that "college." Keep it moving.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.594
Usually I'm the one kicking the girl out
at the end of the night.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.221
I don't care for this.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.183
Oh, is it wrong that I enjoy
making you feel cheap?

02:22.934 --> 02:25.228
Come on, you gotta give me something.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.273
Maybe next time a two

02:28.356 --> 02:31.025
Half-hour catnap
and I'm setting an alarm.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.696
Fine, but it's going to cut
into your cuddling time.

02:34.779 --> 02:35.738
I'll live.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.580
Oh, God.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.960
I thought you were gonna bail on me
after your big date.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.588
Nope. I need recovery time.

02:51.671 --> 02:55.884
I found these old Apple Loops
in the cabinet from before I left.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.552
You think they're still good?

02:57.635 --> 03:00.930
Sure. Better with age, like us.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.642
I have to admit,
I miss a good preservative.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.395
Santa Fe was so "all-natural,"

03:07.478 --> 03:10.607
but nothing beats fruity chemicals
for TV night.

03:10.690 --> 03:15.820
Oh, God, I'd just love to be able to,
you know, just drop it all.

03:15.904 --> 03:19.407
Right. And just relax.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.825
And pass gas.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.493
Oh, please, don't pass gas.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.371
Okay, starting now.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.165
Starting now.

03:31.961 --> 03:32.795
Ah.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.672
Oh.

03:34.756 --> 03:38.927
If you would just use this cane
the doctor gave you,

03:39.010 --> 03:41.012
your knee wouldn't swell up so much.

03:41.095 --> 03:44.515
Well, if Nick saw me with that cane,
he wouldn't swell up so much.

03:45.433 --> 03:50.230
You know, I have to say,
you put in a lot of work for this guy.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.775
Is this where you're gonna start
to get on me for dating a younger man?

03:53.858 --> 03:56.027
No, I'm cool with that.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.530
I used to sit Bud and Coyote down
and explain to them

03:59.614 --> 04:03.743
that it was perfectly natural
if their friends were attracted to me.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.829
Well, that must have been
very comforting for them to hear.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.083
Well, it is
a fair amount of work with Nick.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.252
A few hours of prep,
a few hours of recovery.

04:12.835 --> 04:15.046
And this guy is worth all this?

04:15.129 --> 04:20.176
There are 30 magic minutes in there
when I feel as young as I have ever felt.

04:20.969 --> 04:24.639
Although, I think he did hear a few
"ouches" tonight when I bent my knee.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.683
I don't have that problem with Jacob.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.353
During sex, we both know
that half the moans we're making

04:30.478 --> 04:33.147
have absolutely nothing to do
with pleasure.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.608
That must be nice.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.526
Mm.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.821
But, you know, we know
this has a clear expiration date.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.907
I mean, it's new and exciting for him now
to be dating an older woman,

04:42.991 --> 04:45.952
but he'll move on soon enough.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.706
So... whose night is it?

04:49.789 --> 04:54.544
Well, Tuesday we re-watched<i> Goonies</i>
for the 40th time, so it's my night.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.379
Great!

04:56.504 --> 04:58.089
So...<i> Goonies?</i>

04:59.632 --> 05:01.926
Hey, I forgot my wallet.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.512
Oh, my God!
Oh, he can't see me like this.

05:04.595 --> 05:05.722
-No, no. Okay.
-Help me cover up.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.808
-Okay, okay. Here.
-Make sure my feet are covered.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.768
-Okay.
-Get the lights!

05:12.353 --> 05:14.397
And you gotta give him his wallet.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.191
Okay. Oh, God.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.526
Everything okay in there?

05:18.609 --> 05:21.446
Uh, hold your horses, fat cat!

05:22.113 --> 05:23.656
Well, where the hell is it?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.993
It's on the pony wall in the dining room!
He paid for takeout!

05:27.952 --> 05:29.287
I got it!

05:30.121 --> 05:31.039
Oh.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.958
Of course it's leather, probably Italian.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.378
Oh, Jesus, it feels so buttery.

05:40.798 --> 05:43.968
Interesting technique, turning off
the lights to look for something.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.679
-Hiya, Kooky. Welcome back.
-Thanks.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.433
I missed that inventive nickname so much,
I couldn't stay away.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.560
-Nope.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.648
What's that lump under the afghan?

05:58.941 --> 06:02.570
Four additional afghans.
It gets cold here at night.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.323
Here. Oh, wait.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.410
Finder's fee.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.578
Toodles.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.540
At most, I'm three afghans.

06:17.585 --> 06:21.672
I just had a lovely driveway-chat
with our new neighbor.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.050
Is he that handsome guy
we waved to the other day?

06:24.133 --> 06:26.260
The one who looks like a JCPenney Model?

06:26.385 --> 06:28.471
Yep, Oliver.

06:28.554 --> 06:32.058
He and his boyfriend, Joe,
are planning their backyard wedding.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.477
-Oh, it's a couple.
-Yep.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.854
And I invited them over for drinks later!

06:36.938 --> 06:38.606
Oh, here we go.

06:38.689 --> 06:39.690
What?

06:40.191 --> 06:43.319
Wouldn't it be nice for us
to have "our" gay friends,

06:43.402 --> 06:45.530
instead of "yours" and "mine," separately?

06:45.613 --> 06:46.614
But they're younger, Sol.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.575
And if they like throwing events
in their backyard,

06:49.659 --> 06:51.285
they may be party gays.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.537
Huh.

06:52.620 --> 06:58.084
Is this some of that hip lingo
you picked up from your new <i>Lear</i> crowd?

06:58.167 --> 06:59.794
You mean my theater gays?

06:59.877 --> 07:02.547
-I am.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.799
I am also an elder gay.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.052
And me

07:08.136 --> 07:11.305
No, that's not a thing.
But you may be an activist gay.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.850
-Oh, I like that.
-I thought you might.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.269
And what about our new neighbors?

07:16.352 --> 07:19.730
They have a custom furniture store
in Hillcrest.

07:19.814 --> 07:23.151
Oliver does interiors
and Joe is a carpenter.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.571
A style gay and a butch gay.

07:28.489 --> 07:31.200
Let's not play this with the new guys.
They might hate us.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.035
Agreed.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.542
Wow.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.671
You made quick work
putting this place back together.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.089
Back in, baby!

07:45.381 --> 07:47.800
I did keep a few hints
of Sheree pink, though,

07:48.342 --> 07:52.054
to symbolize the "new"
of my "new old life."

07:52.138 --> 07:55.224
Oof. That's a big concept
for first thing in the morning.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.477
Would this be an easier concept?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.730
I need a ride to the credit union later.

08:01.189 --> 08:05.067
Your new life still inconveniences me
like your old life.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.946
I can't. I have to meet Nick at 4:00.
Listen to this.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.324
"Been thinking about last night.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.659
We need to talk."

08:13.743 --> 08:16.704
Oh, God. He wants a three-way.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.666
No.  Uh...

08:21.209 --> 08:22.585
I know what it is.

08:22.668 --> 08:26.088
We've reached our expiration date.
He's gonna break up with me.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.465
I'm sorry.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.133
It was fun while it lasted.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.553
Not to be indelicate,
but if you're not meeting Nick till 4:00,

08:32.637 --> 08:34.931
maybe you can take me
to the credit union.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.183
You can drive your new old self.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.477
I have to start getting ready now.

08:39.560 --> 08:44.232
I want to look better than ever
so he'll regret it.

08:44.315 --> 08:48.694
Grace... when he breaks up with you,
you know what to tell him.

08:48.778 --> 08:49.946
He has herpes?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.781
He has herpes.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.745
Thank you so much. Have a good one.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.414
Next!

09:00.498 --> 09:02.250
Oh, for fuck's...

09:03.960 --> 09:05.294
Mindy! Look who's back!

09:05.962 --> 09:06.963
Yep.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.675
I hadn't seen you in a couple of months.
I was hoping that you'd changed banks.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.261
Said with a smile. Always a smile.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.931
Look, I'm not looking for trouble
here today, just a new bank card.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.937
Was it a goat

09:23.020 --> 09:25.106
See, this is where we get into trouble.

09:25.189 --> 09:29.902
I am a valued and loyal customer,
and you are a black fly in my chardonnay.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.779
We are required to ask.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.657
And are you required to have that face?

09:36.242 --> 09:38.202
-You're dead.
-Oh, man.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.955
If this is the way
you really want this to go,

09:41.038 --> 09:43.291
let's do this, stone-cold style.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.750
-No! No, no, no!
-Come on! Come on!

09:44.834 --> 09:46.919
No, you're really dead.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.714
Deceased. It says so right here.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.008
What? That's impossible.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.928
Not according to the Social Security
Administration death master file.

09:56.012 --> 10:00.016
Very funny, Mindy.
Would you take me off that, please?

10:00.099 --> 10:04.729
It may surprise you, but that is
about 17,000 steps above my pay grade.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.981
But I'm right here! How can I be dead?

10:07.064 --> 10:09.066
I am not saying that you're dead.

10:09.191 --> 10:12.278
I'm saying that Frankie Bergstein is dead.

10:12.361 --> 10:15.031
Well, okay, I'm Frankie Bergstein.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.490
She's dead.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.242
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

10:18.326 --> 10:19.702
I am.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.705
And I'm afraid I can't issue
a new card to a dead lady.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.165
-Next!

10:24.248 --> 10:26.584
I am standing right here!

10:28.294 --> 10:29.170
Next.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.423
Carolyn!

10:33.924 --> 10:35.009
How's the grandbaby?

10:36.385 --> 10:39.513
Boy, you are dead all over the place.
It's not just the bank.

10:39.597 --> 10:44.143
Social Security, your Visa,
your Red Roof Inn rewards card.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.688
God, Grace, I'm never going to meet
my first grandchild!

10:47.772 --> 10:50.483
That's actually not the way this works.
You're only legally dead.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.736
-Well, I want to be undead.
-Well, that is a whole different thing.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.030
How could this have happened?

10:57.114 --> 10:58.157
Really?

10:58.741 --> 11:02.036
You have absolutely no idea
how this could have happened?

11:03.287 --> 11:06.957
I lost the damn key
to my post office box again.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.460
-The replacement key is--
-Sixty bucks, I know.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.420
I've paid it 12 times.

11:11.504 --> 11:15.174
But I'm moving to Santa Fe.
It's my last batch of mail.

11:15.591 --> 11:18.386
Can't you cut me a little slack
just this once?

11:18.469 --> 11:21.680
The rule is only people with a key
can have access to their mail.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.599
There's no other option?

11:23.682 --> 11:24.767
Not unless...

11:26.185 --> 11:30.773
Hello, darling. I'm here to collect mail
from box 1524.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.817
That belongs to Frankie Bergstein.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.237
Unfortunately, she is no longer with us.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.156
And according to my latest Google search,

11:39.240 --> 11:43.911
her death automatically releases her mail
to the next of kin,

11:44.036 --> 11:45.788
which is yours truly.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.248
This is terrible news.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.793
Although, she didn't look very good
the last time she was here.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.671
She said the same thing about you.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.590
In fact, those were her very last words.

11:56.674 --> 12:00.052
-Oh.

12:00.136 --> 12:03.222
But I never thought
that the post office would tell Mindy!

12:03.305 --> 12:05.015
They tell everyone!

12:05.099 --> 12:06.183
Oh, God.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.311
Oh, boy, when you step in it,
you go deep.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.940
Hey, last week's adventure with Sheree
ended up all good.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.650
They can't all be gems.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.820
Well, this is one
you may not come back from, kiddo.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.739
I've got to go meet Nick.

12:20.823 --> 12:21.741
Oh!

12:22.158 --> 12:23.784
Oh, God, this is gonna kill me.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.995
Well, at least you're still alive!

12:27.246 --> 12:28.122
Ah.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.085
If drinks go well,
I'm going to suggest dinner.

12:33.627 --> 12:37.590
And if that goes well, I think we should
talk to them about Miami in April.

12:37.673 --> 12:41.343
Slow down, Sol. Why don't we wait to see
if we all like each other first?

12:41.427 --> 12:44.388
Of course! Of course! I'm just excited.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.933
We've never had a fun gay couple
in the neighborhood before.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.436
What about Greg and Jeffrey?

12:50.519 --> 12:51.645
I said "fun."

12:53.772 --> 12:57.526
I thought watching Greco-Roman wrestling
was fun.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.488
Come in.
Hi. How are you?

13:00.571 --> 13:01.697
-Hi.

13:01.989 --> 13:05.659
Robert, this is Oliver and Jo.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.371
Hi. Wow, your house is... beautiful.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.375
Thank you. Nice to meet you, Joanna?

13:13.459 --> 13:14.543
No, no. Just Jo.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.629
I see.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.255
I was expecting a...

13:19.089 --> 13:21.592
a... longer name.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.260
-Hmm.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.098
Didn't know what to get

13:28.182 --> 13:30.142
because we've never had coffee together,
have we?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.977
It's weird we've never had coffee.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.813
Oh, God, are you a tea person?

13:35.397 --> 13:37.483
I'm a get-right-to-the-point person.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.861
-So, why don't you...
-Okay. Okay, I'm just going to say it.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.281
I want more.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.452
-No.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.787
I want more you.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.374
No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.836
Grace, do you like me?

13:58.379 --> 14:00.923
Well, I wouldn't be sleeping with you
if I didn't like you.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.175
So, when I like something,
I want more of it.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.928
I've noticed that about you.
You kind of lead with that.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.889
See? It's effortless with you.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.724
I'm not sure I'd call it "effortless."

14:10.891 --> 14:13.894
So, if you like me,
why can't I sleep over once in a while?

14:13.978 --> 14:15.062
Or meet your kids?

14:15.187 --> 14:16.855
Or go away with you sometime?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.440
Because that's not what this is.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.235
Why not

14:21.318 --> 14:23.237
How about a week away in Paris?

14:23.320 --> 14:25.656
Just you, me, and the Champs-Élysées.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.034
How about Santa Barbara for an afternoon?

14:29.118 --> 14:30.578
How about Hawaii?

14:30.661 --> 14:33.831
Bright sun, skinny dipping,
you in a bikini.

14:33.914 --> 14:34.957
Holy shit.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.918
Let's do an overnight in Santa Barbara.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.837
Let's do a long weekend in Santa Barbara.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.589
Okay, forget Santa Barbara.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.758
Now, I'll give you one overnight a week
at my house.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.303
Fine.
And I get to keep a toothbrush there.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.637
Travel-size only.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.849
Deal. Now, more personally...

14:51.932 --> 14:53.309
Oh, my God. There's more?

14:54.059 --> 14:56.937
You've met my son
and I've met zero on your side.

14:57.021 --> 15:00.024
-I want to have dinner with your kids.
-Lunch. One kid.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.775
Lunch. Two kids. Nobu.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.069
My house. One kid. The nice one.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.321
Done.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.700
You show your hand too much.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.994
You could've gotten Santa Barbara.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.329
Oh, you're good.

15:14.663 --> 15:15.998
We'll be right back.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.877
Oh, my God.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.672
What a lovely pair of homosexuals
we have living next door.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.091
I don't know what the hell is happening.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.345
Oliver was so clearly gay
in the driveway this morning.

15:29.428 --> 15:33.724
I'll tell you what's happening, Sol.
You were clearly way off-base.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.608
-Yep, yep.
Here we are.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.486
-It is so lovely here.
Thank you.

15:46.028 --> 15:46.987
So...

15:47.947 --> 15:50.074
-Next May.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.826
I'm pulling for an intimate
family gathering in our backyard.

15:52.952 --> 15:57.373
But I've always dreamed of a wedding
in the Hamptons at Grey Gardens.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.668
You know that short window of time when
the lilies of the valley are in bloom?

16:01.835 --> 16:04.546
I do know that time.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.674
He's the romantic.
I'm the Practical Patty.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.133
Opposites attract!

16:09.510 --> 16:13.263
You guys have a lot going on.
Moving and planning a wedding.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.306
And running a business.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.059
Yeah, with our luck, this is exactly
when we'll get pregnant.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.561
Right

16:19.645 --> 16:23.357
I mean, we're super busy now, but it's
worth it for the future we both want.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.276
I know you're worth it, but you're
the one who has to put up with me.

16:31.532 --> 16:35.202
Okay. Okay, is anybody gonna say
what we're all thinking?

16:35.285 --> 16:36.578
Uh...

16:37.204 --> 16:38.455
What are we all thinking?

16:39.581 --> 16:42.209
Where did you get
those salt and pepper shakers?!

16:42.292 --> 16:46.255
Is it Mary and Lou? Because I love them!

16:47.006 --> 16:48.716
-I love them.
Me too.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.845
No, I am not dead.
I don't care what it says.

16:52.928 --> 16:56.265
I am talking to you
on the phone right now.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.434
Really?

16:58.517 --> 17:02.354
And tell me, do you get a lot
of obituary-scanning swindlers

17:02.438 --> 17:05.107
at Popcorn Ball of the Month?

17:05.232 --> 17:08.068
Next month is butterscotch balls.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.570
And I want to live!

17:10.946 --> 17:13.115
-I mean...
-I know!

17:13.240 --> 17:14.908
-It's just...
-I know!

17:15.034 --> 17:17.244
That's the guy I met in the driveway!

17:17.327 --> 17:19.121
So what the hell are they doing,
those two?

17:19.246 --> 17:22.041
Well, clearly he makes Jo happy.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.667
Maybe they have some arrangement.

17:23.751 --> 17:27.880
Sol, we know exactly what they have.
We had it ourselves.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.757
Someone should tell her the truth.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.135
That's up to Oliver,
and clearly he's not there yet.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.095
What if it takes him 20 years?

17:35.179 --> 17:38.265
I think you may be over-identifying here.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.476
I'm just saying, maybe we should have

17:40.601 --> 17:42.644
-a heart-to-heart with Jo.
!

17:42.728 --> 17:45.814
We're in a very unique position
to help her.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.108
No, sir!

17:48.692 --> 17:51.278
First of all, they're terrific.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.864
Second of all, stop over-identifying!

17:53.947 --> 17:55.616
How can I not?

17:55.699 --> 17:59.203
Why are you trying to ruin this for me?
Do you not want us to have friends?

17:59.286 --> 18:02.623
Sol, we could save that woman
years of regret.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.459
The way we weren't able to do
for Frankie and Grace. Frankie didn't regret
a moment of our time together.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.755
Well, Grace feels differently.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.383
And I'm not gonna stand by now and watch
someone do that to someone else.

18:13.467 --> 18:17.429
I cannot believe I'm hearing you say
you want to out a man you only just met.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.099
Robert!

18:20.557 --> 18:24.520
Whatever you say to her
can't ever be unsaid.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.648
You'll be responsible
for whatever follows.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.859
Are you sure you're ready for that?

18:33.529 --> 18:34.780
No.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.324
So... please...

18:37.950 --> 18:39.451
stay out of this.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.995
You're right. I know you're right.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.956
I know I'm right, too.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.546
Oh... Thank you for doing this
on such short notice, honey.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.549
Are you kidding?
A chance to meet Mom's new boyfriend?

18:53.632 --> 18:56.093
-We're not calling him that.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.471
My man... date.

18:59.930 --> 19:00.764
Okay.

19:02.808 --> 19:06.562
-I'm fine. Let's just sit down.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.313
Hi!

19:08.397 --> 19:10.023
What the hell?

19:10.107 --> 19:12.568
Foolish enough
to leave your side door open.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.319
Why are you here?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.572
Well, to punish you for not inviting me.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.574
And because your youngest
can't keep secrets.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.743
-This wasn't a secret. It was--
-Mom...

19:21.827 --> 19:24.204
you've never introduced us
to anyone that you've dated.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.875
The fact you want Mallory to meet him
and not me means you're hiding something.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.544
Why are you walking that way?
Did he do something to your legs?

19:30.627 --> 19:32.629
I will fucking kill him!

19:32.754 --> 19:34.673
No! I'm fine!

19:35.632 --> 19:37.634
We're just not gonna bring it up
when he's here.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.472
I have to fill you in on a few things
about him first.

19:42.556 --> 19:46.059
What, does he wear a gold chain?
Is there a hairpiece issue?

19:46.226 --> 19:50.522
-No, he's definitely not old.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.691
He's here!

19:54.484 --> 19:55.652
Ooh.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.157
-Nick.
-Hey.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.867
Hi. Oh...

20:02.159 --> 20:04.620
Mmm. Beautiful. Thank you.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.622
-Nick, this is Mallory.
-Hi.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.291
-Pleasure to meet you.
-You, too.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.001
-And this is--
-Brianna!

20:12.169 --> 20:13.003
Nick?

20:13.503 --> 20:15.589
Oh, wow. Whoa, it's been a while. Oh, my God!
You've slept with my daughter!

20:17.841 --> 20:19.218
-Oh, wow!

20:19.301 --> 20:20.802
You really shouldn't have come.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.679
Mom, no!

20:22.804 --> 20:25.682
No, no, no, no, no. No.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.392
He slept with my friend.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.561
He dated my friend, Kelly.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.356
Years ago. Lots of years ago.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.650
Your friend, Kelly?

20:35.817 --> 20:37.611
Your much older friend, Kelly?

20:37.694 --> 20:41.031
I mean... Let's see,
when I was a junior, she was...

20:41.114 --> 20:42.449
Fifty?

20:43.158 --> 20:44.576
-Grace.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.998
Oh, wait, not little Kelly.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.502
Little Kelly who you grew up with?

20:53.585 --> 20:54.419
Grace...

20:54.503 --> 20:56.713
Little Kelly who you went
trick

20:57.714 --> 21:00.300
Little Kelly who pooped in our hot tub?

21:00.384 --> 21:01.802
Oh, that Kelly.

21:01.885 --> 21:05.180
It was not a serious thing,
and it was a while back.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.810
-Yeah. Mom, this was a long time ago.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.812
-Yeah, like, maybe four years ago.
-Ten.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.897
-More like ten.
-Right. Probably ten.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.857
I always get four and ten mixed up.
Who needs a drink?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.609
I'd like a martini, please.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.404
And then, I'd like a pitcher of martinis.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.489
I can make that happen. Girls?

21:22.572 --> 21:23.699
-Same.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.993
Okay, good, good.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.870
And to think I was nervous
about today's lunch.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.959
If it makes you feel any better,
Kelly pooped in my hot tub, too.

21:35.919 --> 21:38.630
Oh, he's funny.
He's funny. Yeah.

21:38.714 --> 21:42.301
It's an existential crisis!
It's a bureaucratic nightmare!

21:42.384 --> 21:47.055
I feel like I am trapped in a body bag
wrapped in a thousand feet of red tape!

21:47.139 --> 21:49.641
-It's terrible. Just terrible.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.519
You know she's not actually dead, Sol.

21:52.602 --> 21:55.355
I know. I know. It just got to me.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.150
You know I love you so much, right?

21:58.233 --> 22:01.111
Everybody needs to toughen up
and get me resurrected

22:01.194 --> 22:03.363
before I really lose my shit!

22:03.447 --> 22:05.532
I hate to tell you,
but it's not going to be easy.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.327
I will do whatever it takes.
What are we talking about here?

22:08.410 --> 22:11.371
A little payola
for one of your judge friends?

22:11.455 --> 22:15.334
I'm afraid we've hit our quota of favors
from our judge friends.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.877
To help get us out of jail.

22:16.960 --> 22:21.757
Oh, damn you feisty queens,
using up all my pay for play!

22:21.840 --> 22:22.716
I'm sorry.

22:22.799 --> 22:26.136
You need to understand
there is no quick fix here.

22:26.219 --> 22:30.140
At this rate,
by the time I'm alive, I will be dead.

22:30.974 --> 22:34.936
Let me get you some of my banana bread.
It always does the trick.

22:40.525 --> 22:43.820
Frankie, can I ask you something
just between us?

22:43.904 --> 22:46.114
Lord, just tell him
you hate his banana bread.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.824
We all know it's too gummy.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.827
It's been that way for years.
It's just that I've gotten used to it.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.663
No, it's more serious
than his banana bread.

22:54.414 --> 22:58.001
I need to ask you, before you got married,

22:58.585 --> 23:03.757
if someone knew that Sol was gay,
would you have wanted them to tell you?

23:06.176 --> 23:07.677
Someone did tell me.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.182
And we never spoke again.

23:25.278 --> 23:26.279
Frankie.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.284
Frankie.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.880
Caw, caw.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.758
Ding, ding. Frankie.

23:48.009 --> 23:50.220
Boy, I was really out to sea there.

23:51.429 --> 23:52.973
What's happening

23:53.056 --> 23:54.850
You'd have to bury me first.

23:54.933 --> 23:58.770
There is an upside to all of this.
No car payments, no more taxes.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.606
I mean, you might even be off
the FBI watch list.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.776
You know what? Being dead
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.865
And let's be honest, when you're my age,
the real thing is not that far off.

24:09.948 --> 24:10.824
Oh.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.659
I mean, what haven't I done?

24:13.243 --> 24:14.870
What regrets do I have?

24:15.829 --> 24:18.456
And do I have time to change things?

24:21.168 --> 24:25.088
Well, I mean,
I know I regret popping by to see you.

24:26.173 --> 24:29.467
Sorry. I can't help reckoning
with a life unfinished.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.679
Wow, this is good times.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.931
What can I do to cheer you up?

24:36.641 --> 24:37.851
Oh...

24:37.934 --> 24:41.688
Do you by chance have
a butterscotch popcorn ball?

24:41.771 --> 24:43.481
There she is.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.321
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.948
Uh, we just wanted to say thank you
for the other night.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.158
Oh, you didn't need to.

24:53.241 --> 24:56.244
Of course, I did have to go to three
different places to find the right one,

24:56.328 --> 24:59.206
but I'm kind of insane about orchids.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.374
Well, who isn't?

25:01.541 --> 25:03.501
-Oh, thanks very much.
-You're very welcome.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.213
So, we'll see you soon, I hope.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.340
You know, Jo and I
were just saying last night

25:08.423 --> 25:11.927
that we would be lucky to be half as happy
as you and Sol seem to be.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.887
Oh, that's very sweet.

25:13.970 --> 25:15.430
How long have you been married?

25:15.972 --> 25:19.434
Not long, but we were both married before.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.603
Oh, really

25:21.686 --> 25:22.604
Yeah.

25:24.397 --> 25:25.941
Actually...

25:27.150 --> 25:29.236
it's a very interesting story.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.878
I can't believe she's never
gonna meet her first grandchild.

25:47.212 --> 25:50.882
She never should have gone
to the post office that day.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.176
<i> Frankie Bergstein is dead.</i>

25:54.094 --> 25:56.137
She had so much more to do.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.640
If she only had the time.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.145
I didn't think she was all that.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.105
Teddie?

26:27.669 --> 26:29.004
This is my travel-size.

26:31.798 --> 26:35.010
I also brought this...
because the big one was a joke.

26:36.845 --> 26:37.846
It's cute...

26:38.680 --> 26:40.181
which just makes this harder.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.684
Oh, no.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.564
Little Kelly, right?

26:49.691 --> 26:52.444
I can't compete with younger women, Nick.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.237
And I don't want to anymore.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.530
Grace, you don't have to.

26:55.613 --> 27:00.076
Look, you have been honest with me,
and I owe you the same thing.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.579
I just... I can't keep this up.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.498
I don't get it.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.088
There's a reality here
that you are not seeing.

27:12.213 --> 27:14.632
Where? What the hell reality
are you talking about?

27:14.716 --> 27:16.801
Me. The reality of me

27:16.885 --> 27:21.056
and everything that goes along
with my... age.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.683
What are you so afraid of?

27:25.977 --> 27:29.022
Once you see the real me,
you are gonna run for the hills.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.523
I want to see you.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.400
That's all I keep saying.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.069
-Yes.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.406
You think you can handle this?

27:40.950 --> 27:43.453
You think you can handle this?

27:45.747 --> 27:47.415
And this?

27:48.124 --> 27:52.379
Knee and all the real nitty-gritty
underneath all of this?

27:53.213 --> 27:54.923
Huh

27:56.091 --> 27:58.385
You want me for real...

28:01.262 --> 28:03.098
Well, here I am, baby.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.351
And there's only one direction I go
from here, I'm afraid,

28:06.434 --> 28:08.103
and it's not prettier.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.899
Oh, yeah, and here...
is my new little friend.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.111
So, you want me?

28:16.694 --> 28:19.155
You want the real me?
Well, this is what you get.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.058
I'll take it.
