WEBVTT

00:07.355 --> 00:10.358
THIS IS POINTLESS. I HAVE READ
THE SAME SENTENCE 10 TIMES.

00:10.358 --> 00:12.403
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

00:12.403 --> 00:15.450
JUST THAT WE HAVE
TO TELL HER...MAGGIE.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.452
WE'RE NOT BEING
FAIR TO HER.

00:17.452 --> 00:18.757
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE
NOT BEING FAIR TO HER.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.846
YOU'RE CHEATING,
AND I'M LYING,

00:20.846 --> 00:22.631
BUT THE POINT IS,
WE'RE NOT MAKING
THE SITUATION ANY BETTER

00:22.631 --> 00:23.980
BY GOING BEHIND HER BACK.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.851
SHE DESERVES TO KNOW.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.160
WHY? WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?

00:30.160 --> 00:32.380
THAT.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.338
WELL...THAT...

00:34.338 --> 00:35.861
PLUS...

00:35.861 --> 00:38.255
I'D LOVE TO HAVE SEX
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.605
NED! OOH!

00:40.605 --> 00:41.954
BE SERIOUS.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.391
THAT'S THE THING.
I AM SERIOUS.

00:43.391 --> 00:47.264
I AM TOTALLY,
COMPLETELY SERIOUS.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.136
I'M SUBLIMATING,
AREN'T I?

00:49.136 --> 00:50.485
TOTALLY.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.139
I'M SEEKING
PHYSICAL PLEASURE

00:52.139 --> 00:54.663
AS A DISTRACTION
FROM MY OWN
MORAL CULPABILITY.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.752
PRETTY MUCH.

00:56.752 --> 00:59.581
WE HAVE TO TELL HER.
WE HAVE TO TELL HER.

00:59.581 --> 01:02.018
I...HAVE SOME CONCERNS

01:02.018 --> 01:04.238
ABOUT YOUR BLOOD WORK.

01:04.238 --> 01:08.851
NORMALLY, WE LIKE TO SEE
A PLATELET COUNT OF SEVERAL
HUNDRED THOUSAND.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.419
RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE AT 68,000.

01:11.419 --> 01:14.030
AND YOUR LIVER FUNCTIONS
ARE ELEVATED.

01:14.030 --> 01:16.946
WH-WHAT--WHAT DOES
ALL THAT MEAN?

01:16.946 --> 01:18.904
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT ANY OF THAT IS.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.906
YOU ARE IN
THE BEGINNING STAGES

01:20.906 --> 01:22.908
OF SOMETHING CALLED
HELLP SYNDROME.

01:22.908 --> 01:27.435
REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED
ABOUT YOUR TOXEMIA,
PREECLAMPSIA?

01:27.435 --> 01:31.221
WELL, IN HELLP SYNDROME,
THE LIVER BECOMES INVOLVED.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.963
MY LIVER?!

01:33.963 --> 01:34.964
GOD!

01:34.964 --> 01:37.053
OK, SO...

01:37.053 --> 01:40.056
WHAT DO WE DO? I MEAN,
HOW DO WE TAKE CARE OF THIS?

01:40.056 --> 01:42.450
I'M GONNA DO
SOME MORE BLOOD WORK
AND LIVER STUDIES.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.365
I'M GONNA WANT YOU
TO COLLECT YOUR URINE

01:44.365 --> 01:46.541
SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE
TO CHECK PROTEIN LEVELS.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.847
OK.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.632
THIS, UH...

01:50.632 --> 01:52.286
THIS SOUNDS BAD.

01:52.286 --> 01:53.852
I MEAN,
THIS SOUNDS DIFFERENT.

01:53.852 --> 01:56.072
YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

01:56.072 --> 01:58.640
THROUGH ALL THE EARLY LABOR
AND THE BED REST STUFF--

01:58.640 --> 02:01.164
I MEAN, TOXEMIA, YEAH,
BUT NOT THIS.

02:01.164 --> 02:04.428
CHARLIE...SOMETIMES THIS IS
VERY HARD TO DIAGNOSE.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.910
IS THERE A REAL RISK HERE?

02:07.910 --> 02:09.999
I MEAN, COULD SOMETHING
ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO HER?

02:13.002 --> 02:13.916
YES.

02:21.619 --> 02:24.796
♪ EVERYBODY WANTS TO LIVE ♪

02:24.796 --> 02:26.276

UM, ARE YOU SURE THAT THIS
IS THE RIGHT NEIGHBORHOOD?

02:55.436 --> 02:56.785
'CAUSE IT LOOKS A LITTLE--

02:56.785 --> 02:58.482
I TOLD THE GUY
AT THE TOURIST DESK

02:58.482 --> 03:00.571
HOW MUCH I COULD SPEND
ON A HOTEL.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.270
HE SAID THIS WAS JUST
ABOUT THE ONLY THING
IN MY PRICE RANGE.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.097
ARE THE NUMBERS
GOING UP OR DOWN?

03:05.097 --> 03:06.534
UM, DOWN, I THINK.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.883
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO--

03:07.883 --> 03:10.799
OH, I GOT IT. REALLY.

03:10.799 --> 03:15.412
UM, HANNAH, HAVE YOU
TALKED TO YOUR PARENTS?

03:15.412 --> 03:17.371
I'M SORRY. I MEAN, I KNOW
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

03:17.371 --> 03:18.981
BUT MAYBE IF YOU
TALKED TO THEM.

03:18.981 --> 03:22.071
I CAN'T TALK TO THEM.HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

03:22.071 --> 03:25.422
YOU KNOW? MAYBE YOU CAN.
MAYBE THEY'D SURPRISE YOU.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.817
LOOK, MY MOM WAS A YEAR
YOUNGER THAN I AM NOW

03:28.817 --> 03:30.949
WHEN SHE GOT PREGNANT
FOR THE FIRST TIME, OK?

03:30.949 --> 03:33.300
SHE AND MY DAD
HAD 3 KIDS

03:33.300 --> 03:36.259
BY THE TIME
THEY WERE 24, SO...

03:36.259 --> 03:39.044
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE
THE PEOPLE TO TALK TO
ABOUT MY OPTIONS,

03:39.044 --> 03:40.872
BECAUSE AS FAR
AS THEY'RE CONCERNED,

03:40.872 --> 03:42.918
I DON'T HAVE ANY.

03:42.918 --> 03:46.965
AND...MAYBE I DON'T.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.967
I MEAN, THEY DID IT,
RIGHT?

03:48.967 --> 03:51.100
THEY HAD A KID
BEFORE THEY WERE READY.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.581
YEAH, PEOPLE DO DO IT.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.714
YEAH. WOMEN DO IT
ALL THE TIME.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.239
EVEN BY THEMSELVES,
RIGHT?

04:02.154 --> 04:04.026
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:04.026 --> 04:07.203
WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME TAKE THIS
THE REST OF THE WAY.

04:07.203 --> 04:08.117
THANKS.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.867
MAYBE WE'RE GETTING
ALL NERVOUS FOR NOTHING.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.738
I MEAN, MAYBE
SHE ALREADY KNOWS.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.653
SHE SENSED IT COMING.
WOMEN DO THAT.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.089
MAYBE SHE WAS THINKING

04:24.089 --> 04:25.961
SHE WAS GONNA HAVE
TO BREAK UP WITH ME.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.571
MAYBE SHE'LL
BE RELIEVED.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.965
VERY POSSIBLE.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.575
OK, THEN.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.666
[CRYING]

04:35.666 --> 04:38.452
I--I JUST HEARD.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.194
YOU HEARD?

04:42.194 --> 04:44.501
CHESTER.

04:44.501 --> 04:48.505
HE WAS--MY BROTHER'S
GIRLFRIEND,

04:48.505 --> 04:51.508
SHE WAS BACKING UP.
SHE WAS TALKING.

04:51.508 --> 04:54.119
SHE SQUASHED HIM.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.512
WHOA!

04:56.905 --> 04:58.428
HER DOG.

04:58.428 --> 05:01.736
NOW ALL I HAVE LEFT
ARE THESE PICTURES.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.433
COME AND SIT.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.265
LOOK AT THIS.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.485
CHESTER ON THE BEACH
IN MENDOCINO.

05:11.485 --> 05:14.836
WASN'T HE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
DOG YOU'VE EVER SEEN?

05:14.836 --> 05:19.188
HE USED TO LOVE
CHEWING THE WRAPPING OFF
OF OUR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.

05:19.188 --> 05:23.845
I KNOW I HAVE
A PICTURE SOMEWHERE.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.716
Bailey: YOU TELL ME
WHAT TO BELIEVE!

05:25.716 --> 05:29.154
"OH, BAY, I'M SO CONFUSED
ABOUT COLLEGE

05:29.154 --> 05:31.287
"AND MY FUTURE,
AND MY FOLKS,
THEY NEVER UNDERSTAND.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.594
"BUT YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS
ARE LIKE MY FAMILY.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.117
"SO I'LL JUST
CRASH WITH YOU.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.119
IT'LL BE LIKE OLD TIMES."I FREAKED, OK?

05:37.119 --> 05:38.207
YEAH, YOU'RE
REALLY SOMETHING
UNDER PRESSURE.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.774
HEY, UNTIL YOU'RE THERE,

05:39.774 --> 05:41.166
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'D DO, EITHER!

05:41.166 --> 05:42.429
I WOULDN'T WALK AWAY
FROM A GIRL

05:42.429 --> 05:43.386
WHO TOLD ME
SHE WAS PREGNANT.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.040
SHE NEVER TOLD ME!

05:45.040 --> 05:46.694
I HEARD THE WHOLE THING
FROM A FRAT GUY

05:46.694 --> 05:48.478
WHO WAS A FRIEND
OF A FRIEND OF HERS.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.045
SO?

05:50.045 --> 05:52.656
SO I FIGURED SHE'D
GET IT TAKEN CARE OF.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.919
THAT SHE WAS EMBARRASSED,
THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME,

05:54.919 --> 05:57.052
AND SHE'D GET IT
TAKEN CARE OF WHILE I WAS
OUT HERE WITH YOU!

05:57.052 --> 05:59.010
SHE CALLED YOU, WILL!

05:59.010 --> 06:00.447
YOU WOULDN'T
TALK TO HER!

06:02.666 --> 06:04.451
THE GIRL FOLLOWED YOU
ACROSS THE COUNTRY!

06:04.451 --> 06:07.671
YEAH! AND THAT'S WEIRD, OK?

06:07.671 --> 06:10.500
I MEAN, YOU MEET SOMEONE
FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL
AT A FRAT PARTY,

06:10.500 --> 06:12.023
YOU TALK TO THEM
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR,

06:12.023 --> 06:14.243
YOU GET SMASHED,
YOU GO SOMEPLACE AND DO IT,

06:14.243 --> 06:16.245
YOU DON'T EXACTLY
EXPECT TO SETTLE DOWN

06:16.245 --> 06:17.768
AND RAISE A FAMILY WITH THEM!

06:17.768 --> 06:18.856
[DOOR OPENING]

06:21.946 --> 06:22.860
HEY.

06:24.558 --> 06:26.429
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:26.429 --> 06:28.779
CHANGE OF PLANS
IS WHAT'S GOING ON.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.391
SO IF WILL HAS TO STAY
AT SOME FLEABAG MOTEL,
THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.915
THAT'S FINE. BE MY GUEST,
BUT SHE'S PREGNANT,

06:33.915 --> 06:36.613
SHE'S A THOUSAND MILES
AWAY FROM HOME,
AND SHE'S STAYING HERE.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.310
NO DISCUSSION.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.909
OH...CHARLIE?

07:15.043 --> 07:16.305
CHARLIE!

07:16.305 --> 07:18.612
Charlie: DAPHNE?COME QUICK!

07:18.612 --> 07:20.091
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:20.091 --> 07:22.050
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.618
I'M SEEING, LIKE, SPOTS,
AND EVERYTHING'S-- AND I CAN'T--

07:24.618 --> 07:26.794
WELL, MAYBE YOUR EYES
ARE JUST ADJUSTING--NO, NO, NO!

07:26.794 --> 07:29.274
SOMETHING IN MY HEAD,
IT'S BAD,

07:29.274 --> 07:31.233
AND EVERYTHING'S,
LIKE, I CAN'T--

07:31.233 --> 07:32.234
I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA PASS OUT.

WHOA. HEY.

07:33.801 --> 07:34.976
CALL THE DOCTOR,
CHARLIE!

07:34.976 --> 07:36.543

07:36.543 --> 07:38.153
SHE'S 27 YEARS OLD,
IN HER 32nd WEEK...

07:38.153 --> 07:39.720
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

PROTEIN COUNT'S 38,000.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.375

SEVERELY PREECLAMPTIC...

07:43.375 --> 07:44.376

07:44.376 --> 07:46.117
I'M RIGHT HERE.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.423
NO. I'M RIGHT HERE.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THIS ROOM.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.511
OH, GOD.
OH, PLEASE STAY HERE.

07:48.511 --> 07:49.860
I'M RIGHT HERE.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.253
I'M RIGHT HERE.
DON'T GO, OK?

07:51.253 --> 07:52.167
I'M RIGHT HERE.

07:56.606 --> 07:59.043
I DON'T KNOW, BAY.
NO. I NEED YOU TO--

07:59.043 --> 08:03.265
OK. OK, JUST CALL JULIA
AND GET HER TO STAY
WITH OWEN.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.919
RIGHT.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.224
OK.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.661
THANKS.

08:09.706 --> 08:12.100

HE'S GONNA COME RIGHT OVER.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.450
OW!

08:14.450 --> 08:16.713
THAT REALLY HURT.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.976
WHAT--WHAT HURTS?
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:18.976 --> 08:21.979
SHE HAS SOME PAIN
IN HER UPPER ABDOMEN.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.764
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

08:23.764 --> 08:26.331
THAT'S A FURTHER INDICATION
OF LIVER INVOLVEMENT.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.073
OH.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.379
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE FEELING

08:30.379 --> 08:32.207
SOME OF THE THINGS
YOU'RE FEELING--

08:32.207 --> 08:35.645
THE PAIN,
THE WEIRD REFLEXES,
THE VISION PROBLEMS.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.342
FROM YOUR
BLOOD PRESSURE,

08:37.342 --> 08:39.693
A SWOLLEN LIVER,
SOME SWELLING IN YOUR BRAIN

08:39.693 --> 08:41.651
THAT COMES
ALONG WITH IT.

08:41.651 --> 08:45.263
SO WE WILL
WATCH YOUR NUMBERS,
WE'LL MONITOR THE BABY,

08:45.263 --> 08:46.830
AND IF YOU GET
IN TROUBLE,

08:46.830 --> 08:48.266
YOU'RE ALREADY
IN THE HOSPITAL,

08:48.266 --> 08:52.183
SO WE'LL BE ABLE
TO ACT IMMEDIATELY.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.795
CLAUD--CLAUD, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HER EXACT CONDITION IS.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.144
I JUST WALKED IN THE DOOR.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.233
PUT THE ORANGE JUICE
DOWN, OWEN.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.191
WOULD YOU WATCH HIM
FOR A SECOND?

09:00.191 --> 09:02.237
NO. I TALKED TO CHARLIE
FOR, LIKE, A MINUTE

09:02.237 --> 09:04.239
BEFORE I CAME OVER HERE
TO WATCH OWEN.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.370
I COULD HAVE
DONE THAT FOR YOU.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.111
THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.983
LISTEN, I'LL TRY
TO REACH THEM AT--

09:08.983 --> 09:10.288
AT THE HOSPITAL, AND THEN
I'LL CALL YOU BACK, OK?

09:10.288 --> 09:12.290
IT SOUNDS
REALLY SCARY, JULE.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.466
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD
BE HOME WITH YOU GUYS.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.947
NO. JUST STAY THERE,
AND I'LL CALL YOU RIGHT BACK--

09:16.947 --> 09:18.949
OWEN, PUT THE MARSHMALLOW
FLUFF DOWN.
I'M HUNGRY.

09:18.949 --> 09:21.212
I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE.WE'RE ALL SITTING HERE.

09:21.212 --> 09:24.259
I'M STUCK IN THE HOUSE,
CLAUD--OWEN!

09:24.259 --> 09:26.217
WOULD YOU GET HIM
OUT OF HERE?

09:26.217 --> 09:28.045
LET'S GO, BUDDY.

09:28.045 --> 09:31.135
JUST SIT TIGHT,
AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK,

09:44.061 --> 09:45.759

AND TOLD ME--

09:45.759 --> 09:46.847
YOU JUST MISSED HIM.

09:46.847 --> 09:49.806
HE JUST WENT
TO GET SOME AIR.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.373
I THINK IT WAS AIR.

09:51.373 --> 09:52.983
MAYBE IT WAS A SODA.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.596
ARE YOU--

09:56.596 --> 10:00.948
I MEAN--I WAS WORRIED,
SO, I MEAN--

10:00.948 --> 10:03.037
IT IS OK THAT I'M--

10:03.037 --> 10:05.561
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
PICK A SENTENCE AND,
LIKE, GO WITH IT.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.390
RIGHT.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.304
SORRY.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.742
HOW ARE YOU?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.964
I DON'T KNOW.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.574
WE'RE JUST WAITING.

10:18.574 --> 10:22.970
AND SEEING...WHAT
MY BODY'S GONNA DO.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.191
WHAT THE BABY'S
GONNA DO.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.976
IT'S A GOOD HOSPITAL,
DAPHNE.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.152
THEY'VE GOT REALLY
GOOD DOCTORS HERE.

10:31.152 --> 10:34.677
PAUL SAID IT'S
THE BEST NEONATAL UNIT
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA,

10:34.677 --> 10:37.114
IF THAT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.594
MM-HMM.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.165
HEY!

10:44.165 --> 10:45.949
HEY.
HOW IS SHE?

10:45.949 --> 10:48.560
SHE'S, UM...

10:48.560 --> 10:50.214
I DON'T KNOW.

10:50.214 --> 10:53.130
I MEAN,
IT'S ALL NUMBERS
AND MEDICAL TERMS

10:53.130 --> 10:54.436
AND NURSES
SCRIBBLING STUFF

10:54.436 --> 10:55.742
AND DOCTORS
LOOKING WORRIED.

10:57.439 --> 11:00.398
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ELSE FOR SURE.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.097
EXCEPT FOR
THAT IT'S BAD.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.884
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET BACK TO HER.

11:07.884 --> 11:08.755
YEAH.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.020
SHE KEEPS
LOOKING AT ME,

11:13.020 --> 11:16.197
DAPHNE,
IN THAT WAY THAT--

11:16.197 --> 11:19.026
REMEMBER HOW MOM
WAS ON AIRPLANES,

11:19.026 --> 11:21.724
HOW SHE'D KEEP
ASKING YOU, ARE YOU OK?
ARE YOU SCARED?

11:21.724 --> 11:23.247
YEAH.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.640
AND AS LONG AS YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T, SHE WAS OK.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.685
SHE COULD GET
THROUGH THE FLIGHT,

11:25.685 --> 11:26.860
BUT IF YOU
HIT A BIG BUMP,

11:26.860 --> 11:28.035
AND YOU SQUEEZED
HER HAND TOO HARD,

11:28.035 --> 11:29.863
THAT WAS IT.
SHE WAS GONE.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.912
SHE NEEDS ME
TO BE STRONG.

11:35.912 --> 11:36.913
AND I DON'T KNOW.

11:39.437 --> 11:42.049
I DON'T KNOW, BAY.

11:42.049 --> 11:45.574
I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND
THAT PLACE IN MYSELF,
YOU KNOW?

11:47.097 --> 11:48.098
IT'S THERE.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.284
OWEN'S UPSTAIRS BASHING
2 TRUCKS INTO EACH OTHER

12:00.284 --> 12:03.200
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.290
UM...

12:06.290 --> 12:08.162
NO WORD FROM
THE HOSPITAL?

12:08.162 --> 12:11.165
NO.

12:11.165 --> 12:13.254
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO HANG OUT HERE
IF YOU DON'T WANT.

12:13.254 --> 12:14.864
THAT'S OK.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.997
I KNOW YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN LIFE
AND EVERYTHING.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.130
NOT REALLY.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.784
HOW IS, UH--

12:21.784 --> 12:24.787
GOD, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HER NAME.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.136
WHO?

12:26.136 --> 12:27.964
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

12:27.964 --> 12:31.011
OH...YEAH--YEAH, HER.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.621
SHE'S, UH--IT'S, UH...

12:32.621 --> 12:35.493
STACEY.
SHE'S FINE.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.669
UM, SHE'S OUT OF TOWN
ON A FAMILY THING,
ACTUALLY.

12:37.669 --> 12:38.888
MMM.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.241
I WISH HE'D CALL.

12:49.681 --> 12:53.773
BAILEY. I STOPPED
BY THE RESTAURANT TO, UH--

12:53.773 --> 12:56.210
TO PICK UP
YOUR FINAL PAYCHECK?

12:56.210 --> 12:58.734
NO. TO TALK TO YOU.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.432
AND GLEN TOLD ME--
HE SAID--

13:03.173 --> 13:06.133
MAN, I'M--

13:06.133 --> 13:07.525
CAN I WAIT WITH YOU?

13:07.525 --> 13:09.876
I DON'T THINK SO, WILL.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.703
WHY NOT?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.531
COME ON, BAY.

13:13.531 --> 13:16.665
LOOK, I GET WHY
YOU HAD TO KICK ME
OUT OF YOUR PLACE.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.798
AND IT'S OK.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.018
I MEAN,
SARAH HAS OBVIOUSLY TAKEN
HANNAH'S SIDE IN ALL THIS.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.890
IS THERE
ANOTHER SIDE TO IT?

13:23.890 --> 13:25.456
I DON'T THINK SO, WILL.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.372
COME ON, MAN! YOU GOT--

13:28.372 --> 13:30.635
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO HERE, BAILEY, HUH?

13:30.635 --> 13:33.682
I MAKE ONE MISTAKE--
ONE MISTAKE--
AND THAT'S IT FOR ME?

13:33.682 --> 13:35.510
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
JUST HOW IT GOES.

13:35.510 --> 13:39.906
BAILEY,
HAVING A BABY RIGHT NOW
IS GONNA RUIN MY LIFE.

13:39.906 --> 13:43.039
FORGET HAVING THE TIME
TO FIGURE OUT WHO I AM
OR WHAT I WANT.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.432
NOW I'M NEVER GONNA
HAVE THE CHANCE.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.347
HANNAH HAS THIS BABY,

13:46.347 --> 13:48.871
AND I AM STUCK BEING
THE PERSON I AM
RIGHT THIS SECOND.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.482
NO COLLEGE, NO JOB.
NO CLUE!

13:51.482 --> 13:55.835
AND THAT IS NOT SOMEBODY
READY TO--TO RAISE A KID!

13:55.835 --> 13:57.488
I CAN'T DO THIS NOW,
MAN.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.403
THERE'S OTHER STUFF.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.928
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
PERSON IN THE WORLD,
YOU KNOW?

14:01.928 --> 14:03.190
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.408
YOU SHOULD LEAVE, WILL.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.109
WHAT IS IT?

14:09.109 --> 14:10.762
HER TEST RESULTS
JUST CAME IN.

14:10.762 --> 14:11.981
Charlie: SO I WANT
TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.417
IF THOSE ARE
THE NUMBERS,

14:13.417 --> 14:15.158
YOU'RE SAYING--
YOU'RE SAYING, WHAT,

14:15.158 --> 14:17.334
THAT WE SHOULD--
THE BABY SHOULD
COME OUT RIGHT NOW?

14:17.334 --> 14:19.423
THAT BABY'S SMALL,
CHARLIE.

14:19.423 --> 14:22.252
WE'RE NOT CERTAIN
THAT IT'S...

14:22.252 --> 14:23.297
WELL, VIABLE.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.429
OH, GOD...

14:25.429 --> 14:27.823
THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY
IT MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO BREATHE ON ITS OWN,

14:27.823 --> 14:30.130
THAT ITS BRAIN ISN'T
SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED--

14:30.130 --> 14:31.479
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?!

14:31.479 --> 14:32.828
ARE YOU SAYING
BRAIN DAMAGE?

14:32.828 --> 14:34.351
DAPHNE.

14:34.351 --> 14:37.398
SO IF SHE CAN HOLD ON
A LITTLE BIT LONGER,

14:37.398 --> 14:38.529
IF THE BABY HAS
MORE TIME TO DEVELOP--

14:38.529 --> 14:40.488
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.446
DAPHNE'S CONDITION
IS PROGRESSING SO FAST
THAT IT--

14:44.187 --> 14:47.538
WELL, THERE ARE RISKS
ON BOTH SIDES.

14:47.538 --> 14:50.063
YOUR PLATELET COUNT
IS NOW SO LOW,

14:50.063 --> 14:51.281
YOU COULD BEGIN
TO HEMORRHAGE.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.587
THAT COULD HAPPEN
ANY SECOND.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.415
AND YOUR LIVER--

14:54.415 --> 14:56.460
YOU SAID THERE WAS SOME DAMAGE--
WE'RE BEYOND THAT NOW.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.767
I THINK WE'RE LOOKING
AT THE POSSIBILITY
OF LIVER FAILURE,

14:58.767 --> 15:01.901
AND THE IMPLICATIONS
OF THAT ARE, WELL...

15:01.901 --> 15:04.686
CHARLIE?OH, GOD, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

15:04.686 --> 15:06.253
THAT ONLY ONE
OF THEM IS GONNA
MAKE IT OUT OF HERE?

15:06.253 --> 15:10.257
SHE'S NOT EVEN SAYING THAT.DAPHNE--

15:10.257 --> 15:12.912
SHE'S NOT EVEN
SAYING THAT, CHARLIE!

15:14.914 --> 15:17.786
I NEED TO KNOW HOW
YOU WANT US TO PROCEED.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.136
WHAT?

15:20.136 --> 15:22.486
YOU NEED US TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO?!

15:22.486 --> 15:24.053
HOW SHOULD WE--
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR HERE!

15:24.053 --> 15:25.446
FOR GOD'S SAKE!

15:25.446 --> 15:28.057
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT
YOUR PRIORITY IS.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.277
THAT WILL DETERMINE
OUR IMMEDIATE
COURSE OF ACTION.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.888
PRIORITY?

15:32.888 --> 15:34.672
YOU MEAN, WHO?

15:34.672 --> 15:37.023
WHICH ONE OF US?

15:38.850 --> 15:40.113
YES.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.071
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO DECIDE THAT?

15:42.071 --> 15:44.682
YOU'RE ASKING US TO--

15:44.682 --> 15:46.467
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED--

15:46.467 --> 15:48.512
OH, GOD! CHARLIE!

15:48.512 --> 15:51.472
WOULD YOU GIVE US--
WE NEED--DO WE HAVE
A FEW MINUTES?

15:51.472 --> 15:52.908
[DAPHNE SOBBING]

16:02.178 --> 16:03.788
HI. I'M--

16:03.788 --> 16:05.007
Julia: NED.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.009
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU--

16:07.009 --> 16:09.098
YOU SAID YOU'D CALL
AND LET ME KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.840
WHEN YOU DIDN'T,
I GOT WORRIED, SO--

16:11.840 --> 16:13.668
GRIFFIN, THIS IS NED.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.017
OH. YOU'RE GRIFFIN.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.540
I'M NED.

16:16.540 --> 16:17.977
YEAH, I GOT THAT.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.283
I'M--I'M QUICK THAT WAY.

16:20.283 --> 16:21.632
NED'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

16:21.632 --> 16:24.070
YEAH, WE'RE...FRIENDS.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.289
FROM SCHOOL.
STANFORD.

16:28.813 --> 16:31.251
YOU REALLY DIDN'T
NEED TO COME UP HERE.

16:31.251 --> 16:34.080
OH, HEY...HE WAS WORRIED.

16:46.788 --> 16:49.356
WE HAVEN'T--
WE--WE NEED MORE TIME.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.792
I'M SORRY, CHARLIE.

16:53.925 --> 16:56.015
BAY, COULD YOU
SIT WITH HER?

17:01.150 --> 17:03.761
CHARLIE, IF YOUR
DECISION IS TO WAIT,

17:03.761 --> 17:05.459
THAT'S ONE THING.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.852
BUT IF YOU'RE WAITING
ONLY TO DECIDE LATER

17:07.852 --> 17:09.245
TO GO AHEAD
WITH THE DELIVERY,

17:09.245 --> 17:11.204
THAT'S TIME
YOU CAN'T AFFORD.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.249
SHE CAN'T--[SIGHS]

17:13.249 --> 17:15.947
SHE'S A MESS.
THERE'S NO TALKING
ABOUT THIS WITH HER.

17:18.254 --> 17:20.648
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
PLEASE?

17:20.648 --> 17:22.998
I--I CAN'T DO THAT.
I'M SORRY.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.609
PLEASE. 'CAUSE
I CAN'T DECIDE THIS.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.089
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

17:29.178 --> 17:32.703
HOW DO I CHOOSE?
I MEAN--

17:32.703 --> 17:37.447
ONE OF THEM I HAVEN'T MET
AND THE OTHER ONE I'M JUST
STARTING TO KNOW.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.101
BUT I LOVE 'EM BOTH.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.539
I LOVE 'EM BOTH.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.063
I KNOW YOU DO.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.067
I NEED AN ANSWER.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.419
CHARLIE...

17:52.419 --> 17:54.725
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, CHARLIE?

18:00.253 --> 18:01.863
SAVE HER LIFE.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.910

AND GET THAT BABY OUT.WHAT?!

18:12.395 --> 18:13.527
DID WE PAGE DR. BHATT?Nurse: YES, DOCTOR.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.703
NO! WHAT ABOUT
THE BABY?

18:15.703 --> 18:17.096
LET'S HAVE A NEONATOLOGIST
STANDING BY.
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.488
Dr. Murtry:
LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

18:20.969 --> 18:22.536
DO YOU THINK THEY
HAVEN'T CALLED BECAUSE
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

18:22.536 --> 18:24.538
OR 'CAUSE SOMETHING
HORRIBLE'S HAPPENED

18:24.538 --> 18:26.714
AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO GET TO A PHONE?

18:30.892 --> 18:31.980
SAY SOMETHING.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.634
DISTRACT ME.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.636
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

18:35.636 --> 18:36.941
SOMETHING ELSE.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.900
SOMETHING
NOT SO COMPLICATED.

18:38.900 --> 18:42.425
IT'S KIND OF THE ONLY THING
IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.776
HOW'D YOU GET AWAY?
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO MAGGIE?

18:45.776 --> 18:49.345
I TOLD HER I HAD TO COME
TO THE CITY TO RESEARCH
THAT DOROTHEA LANGE PAPER

18:49.345 --> 18:50.955
AT THE MUSEUM
OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

18:50.955 --> 18:54.437
GOD, SHE WAS SO UPSET.

18:54.437 --> 18:57.701
MAYBE YOU
SHOULD HAVE STAYED.

18:57.701 --> 19:02.576
I MEAN,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE,
BUT AT LEAST CALL HER.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.404
YOU SHOULD CALL HER.

19:04.404 --> 19:05.405
YEAH.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.196
HEY, IT'S ME.

19:14.196 --> 19:17.982

HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

19:17.982 --> 19:22.596
WELL, IT'S A BREATHING
TECHNIQUE THAT'S WORKED
FOR CENTURIES.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.076
UH-HUH.

19:25.076 --> 19:30.647

19:59.154 --> 20:01.939
NO NEWS YET

20:08.946 --> 20:11.035
IT'S A C-SECTION.
IT CAN'T POSSIBLY
TAKE THIS LONG.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.136
I'M TAKING THE BABY
TO NEONATAL
INTENSIVE CARE.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.703

GOING TO BE OK?

20:26.703 --> 20:28.357
I'M SORRY.

20:36.974 --> 20:38.106
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, BAY,
YOU COME GET ME, YOU GOT IT?

20:38.106 --> 20:39.020
I GOT IT!

20:42.589 --> 20:45.156
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
DO THIS FOR ME.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.768
YEAH, I DID. LOOK,
YOU CAN'T HAVE A BABY

20:47.768 --> 20:50.118
WITHOUT SEEING
A DOCTOR AT LEAST ONCE
DURING YOUR PREGNANCY.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.250
IT'S NOT SAFE.

20:53.991 --> 20:57.734
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK,
HANNAH.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.346
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS

21:00.346 --> 21:02.043
AND SIT WITH BAILEY
AND CHARLIE.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.871
I'LL BET KIRSTEN AND PAUL
ARE THERE ALREADY,

21:03.871 --> 21:05.786
AND MAYBE EVEN GRIFFIN
AND JULIA.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.570
WHO ARE
ALL THOSE PEOPLE?

21:07.570 --> 21:08.571
FAMILY.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.660
FRIENDS, OLD FRIENDS.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.096
THAT'S NICE.

21:12.096 --> 21:15.099
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE
THAT BABY ALREADY.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.623
IT HASN'T EVEN
BEEN BORN YET.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.886
RIGHT.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.716
AND I'M NOT
GONNA HAVE THAT.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.979
I DON'T EVEN HAVE WILL.

21:24.979 --> 21:29.157
I MEAN, YOU CAN FORCE
SOMEONE TO BE
RESPONSIBLE,

21:29.157 --> 21:32.639
BUT YOU CAN'T FORCE THEM
TO CARE.

21:41.517 --> 21:44.868
EXCUSE ME.
IS THERE SOMEBODY
THAT I COULD TALK--

21:44.868 --> 21:46.870
MY BABY'S IN THERE,
AND I NEED TO--

21:46.870 --> 21:47.741
I'M SORRY.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.926
MAYBE IT'S LIKE
WITH A JURY, YOU KNOW?

21:58.926 --> 22:01.842
THEY BRING YOU IN
TO TELL YOU THAT
IT'S ALL OVER FOR YOU.

22:01.842 --> 22:04.758
NO ONE LOOKS YOU
IN THE EYE.

22:07.891 --> 22:12.287
CHARLIE, YOU CAN'T
THINK THAT WAY.

22:12.287 --> 22:15.812
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF FIRST CLASS
OPENS UP, OK? GREAT.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.814
HI.HI.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.163
I JUST RAN ALL THE WAY
FROM THE CAR.

22:19.163 --> 22:22.123
SALINGER. UH,
CLAUDIA SALINGER.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.255
I'M NOT, LIKE,
TOO LATE, AM I?

22:24.255 --> 22:27.084
NO, YOU'RE FINE.
WE'LL CALL YOU WHEN
WE'RE READY TO BOARD.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.651
READY TO BOARD?

22:28.651 --> 22:30.218
OH, WE'RE DELAYED
DUE TO FOG.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.872
DELAYED? NO, YOU CAN'T BE--

22:31.872 --> 22:33.439
OK.

22:33.439 --> 22:36.006
OK, DELAYED. HOW LONG?
HOW LONG IS THE DELAY?

22:36.006 --> 22:37.617
UNTIL THE FOG LIFTS.

22:37.617 --> 22:40.141
NO. LOOK, I HAVE TO BE
IN SAN FRANCISCO, OK?

22:40.141 --> 22:42.143
THERE IS AN EMERGENCY
GOING ON THERE RIGHT NOW,

22:42.143 --> 22:44.145
AND I SHOULD BE THERE
WITH MY FAMILY.

22:44.145 --> 22:46.365
I SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE STANDING HERE
TRYING TO GET THERE.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.540
I SHOULD HAVE JUST
BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.585
MS. SALINGER,

22:49.585 --> 22:53.459
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT THE FOG?

23:05.558 --> 23:08.561
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
COME IN THE HOUSE,
GRIFFIN.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.998
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
HANG OUT OUT HERE,
WAITING FOR UPDATES.

23:12.216 --> 23:13.522
GRIFFIN.

23:13.522 --> 23:14.828
WHO'S...

23:14.828 --> 23:15.829
THIS GUY?

23:15.829 --> 23:17.657
WHY IS HE HERE?

23:17.657 --> 23:19.006
NED?

23:19.006 --> 23:20.573
HE'S--

23:20.573 --> 23:23.532
I TOLD YOU.
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.404
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.667
IF HE WERE JUST A FRIEND,

23:27.667 --> 23:30.234
HE WOULDN'T BE LYIN'
ABOUT WHERE HE IS
AND WHO HE'S WITH.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.236
HE WOULDN'T LIE
ABOUT BEING WITH YOU.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.981
HE'S NOT JUST A FRIEND,
IS HE, JULIA?

23:42.072 --> 23:43.987
NO...HE'S NOT.

23:43.987 --> 23:46.381
GRIFFIN...

23:46.381 --> 23:50.254
LOOK, I'M--I'M SORRY.
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.
I JUST--IT'S WEIRD.

23:50.254 --> 23:53.170
WHO'S MAGGIE?I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
STRAIGHT WITH YOU,

23:53.170 --> 23:54.998
BUT NED AND I WERE
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
OUR RELATIONSHIP OUT,

23:54.998 --> 23:57.087
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO--WHO'S MAGGIE?

24:02.266 --> 24:04.181
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.627
THEY STILL HAVEN'T CLOSED.

24:14.627 --> 24:15.976
BUT IT'S BEEN--

24:15.976 --> 24:18.152
I KNOW.
THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.284
COMPLICATIONS?

24:20.284 --> 24:22.417
WHAT IS IT WITH DOCTORS, MAN?
DO THEY TEACH YOU
IN MED SCHOOL

24:22.417 --> 24:24.288
TO DRAG THIS STUFF OUT
FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT
OR WHAT?

24:24.288 --> 24:25.812
SHE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

24:25.812 --> 24:28.075
OH.

24:28.075 --> 24:30.077
I'M SORRY, MAN.
I JUST--

24:30.077 --> 24:31.295
CHARLIE!

24:33.646 --> 24:35.778
HEY, HOW'S THE BABY?

24:35.778 --> 24:37.998
THEY WON'T LET ME SEE HER.
I'M NOT GETTIN' ANY ANSWERS.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.913
KIRSTEN'S POSTED THERE.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.131
SHE'S STILL IN SURGERY?

24:43.003 --> 24:45.048
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

24:45.048 --> 24:47.311
WHAT KIND OF REACTION
DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO HAVE?

24:47.311 --> 24:49.836
I MEAN,
THE JERK'S INVOLVED
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.447
HE'S NOT DATING YOU,
JULIA. HE'S HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH YOU.

24:52.447 --> 24:55.319
I THINK YOU'RE MAKIN'
A HUGE MISTAKE.

24:55.319 --> 24:57.104
LIKE THE MISTAKE
I MADE WITH YOU?

24:57.104 --> 24:59.280
WHAT?

24:59.280 --> 25:02.413
I WAS SEEING JUSTIN
WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER.
WAS THAT A MISTAKE?

25:02.413 --> 25:04.807
GRIFFIN, YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T HAVE LOVED TO
HAVE GONE OFF TO COLLEGE

25:04.807 --> 25:08.071
AND MET
SOME SWEET UNATTACHED,
UNCOMPLICATED GUY?

25:08.071 --> 25:10.987
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
HAPPEN THAT WAY.

25:10.987 --> 25:14.991
YOU KNOW THAT.
WE CAN'T ALL GO OUT
AND MEET SOMEONE--

25:14.991 --> 25:16.427
SOMEONE
WHO'S FREE AND CLEAR,
LIKE THIS GIRL!

25:16.427 --> 25:18.212
WHAT GIRL?

25:18.212 --> 25:20.431
THE GIRL THAT YOU MET.
THE GIRL THAT YOU'RE SEEING,

25:20.431 --> 25:22.433
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S-HER-NAME.

25:22.433 --> 25:23.826
OH, UH, UH, TRACEY.

25:23.826 --> 25:26.829
I THOUGHT
YOU SAID IT WAS STACEY.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.136
THAT'S RIGHT. OH, STACEY.
YEAH, IT'S STACEY.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.312
YOU DON'T KNOW
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S NAME?

25:31.312 --> 25:34.097
UH, LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:34.097 --> 25:37.187
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I MADE HER UP.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.233
YOU WHAT?

25:39.233 --> 25:45.326
I MADE HER UP,
SO YOU'D FEEL FREE
TO GO MEET SOMEONE!

25:45.326 --> 25:47.502
WELL...OK, THEN.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.156
NOW, I HAVE.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.114
NOW, I--I'VE MET
SOMEONE ELSE, GRIFFIN.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.203
YEAH, WELL, I NEVER
WOULD HAVE DONE IT

25:53.203 --> 25:56.424
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN
THAT SOMEONE ELSE
WAS SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.095
BAILEY...

26:16.575 --> 26:20.100
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
ARE YOU OK?

26:20.100 --> 26:21.492
WHAT DID
THE DOCTOR SAY?

26:21.492 --> 26:23.146
OH, UH,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.061
THE DOCTOR
SAYS I'M FINE.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.454
GOOD.

26:29.109 --> 26:32.242
HEY, BAILEY, CAN
I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

26:32.242 --> 26:34.244
YEAH.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.075
I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE THE BABY.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.425
I CAN'T.

26:41.425 --> 26:42.862
I'M 18, BAILEY.

26:42.862 --> 26:45.647
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T DO IT BY MYSELF.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.520
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE AN ABORTION?

26:51.044 --> 26:53.699
I KNOW IT'S HORRIBLE,
YOU KNOW,

26:53.699 --> 26:55.788
TO TALK ABOUT IT HERE
IN FRONT OF ALL OF YOU.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.746
NO, IT ISN'T. NO.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.095
I'M SORRY.

26:59.095 --> 27:01.620
YEAH, AND I KNOW
WHAT SARAH WOULD SAY.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.012
HEY, COME ON.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.318
[SIGHS]

27:04.318 --> 27:06.494
SO...

27:06.494 --> 27:08.409
WHEN, DO YOU THINK?

27:08.409 --> 27:09.845
I DON'T KNOW.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.586
I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT,
YOU KNOW?

27:11.586 --> 27:14.328
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY
TO DO IT HERE,

27:14.328 --> 27:17.897
BUT IF I WAIT
TILL I GET HOME, UH...

27:17.897 --> 27:20.290
YOU KNOW, IF PEOPLE
AT SCHOOL FIND OUT--

27:20.290 --> 27:22.510
IF MY FAMILY FINDS OUT.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.556
I DON'T KNOW.

27:28.559 --> 27:31.345
DO YOU--DO YOU
THINK YOU COULD...

27:35.436 --> 27:38.178
OH, WAIT. NO.
NO, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.570
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.224
NO, IT'S NOT.

27:41.224 --> 27:44.793
LOOK, IT'S PETTY CASH
FROM THE RESTAURANT, OK?

27:44.793 --> 27:47.143
IT'S $400.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

27:49.493 --> 27:50.886
HERE.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.366
I'LL PAY YOU BACK.

27:52.366 --> 27:53.715
I PROMISE.

27:53.715 --> 27:56.936
I KNOW, AND I'M
GONNA GO WITH YOU.

27:56.936 --> 27:59.242
NO.YES.

27:59.242 --> 28:01.070
JUST AS SOON AS THINGS
SETTLE DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

28:02.419 --> 28:04.639
I GOTTA GO.

28:05.596 --> 28:08.512
Woman: CHARLIE SALINGER?

28:08.512 --> 28:09.775
RIGHT HERE.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.298
SHE'S OUT OF SURGERY.

28:11.298 --> 28:13.039
SHE TOOK 15 UNITS
OF BLOOD.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.127
OH, MY GOD.

28:14.127 --> 28:15.824
SHE WAS HEMORRHAGING.

28:15.824 --> 28:16.912
THAT'S WHY WE WERE
IN THERE THAT LONG,

28:16.912 --> 28:18.348
BUT SHE'S
STABILIZED NOW,

28:18.348 --> 28:19.567
AND WE'RE MOVING HER
INTO RECOVERY.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.917
SO SHE'S GONNA BE OK?

28:21.917 --> 28:25.834
I--I CAN'T...
SHE COULD IMPROVE.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.445
YES, THE SYNDROME
COULD REVERSE ITSELF OR...

28:28.445 --> 28:30.447
LET'S JUST WAIT
AND SEE, OK?

28:32.188 --> 28:33.842
WELL, IT'S 911.
I'VE GOTTA GO.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.626
SHE'S GONNA BE
IN RECOVERY
FOR A FEW HOURS.

28:35.626 --> 28:36.715
YOU CAN SEE HER THEN.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.059
THEY DON'T KNOW YET.

29:17.059 --> 29:19.670
THERE ARE SOME,
UH, I THINK...

29:19.670 --> 29:20.846
WHAT ARE...

29:25.067 --> 29:27.678
THANKS.

29:27.678 --> 29:31.770
IT'S LIKE SOUP OUT THERE.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.861
P.A.: SORRY TO REPORT, FOLKS,
WE'RE PUSHING OUR DEPARTURE
TIME BACK YET AGAIN

29:35.861 --> 29:39.299
DUE TO THOSE VISIBILITY PROBLEMS
IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA.

29:39.299 --> 29:42.389
AS SOON AS THE FOG LIFTS,
WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.088
[SOFTLY SOBBING]

29:52.094 --> 29:53.226
PLEASE.

29:56.751 --> 29:57.708
CHARLIE.

30:01.147 --> 30:05.107
THEY'RE SAYING--
THEY'RE SAYING THAT
YOU CAN SEE HER NOW.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.169
HEY...

30:23.169 --> 30:24.431
HEY, THERE...

30:26.999 --> 30:28.652
YOU'RE UP, HUH?

30:28.652 --> 30:31.481
JUST BARELY.

30:31.481 --> 30:33.832
YOU DID GREAT.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.486
I DID?

30:45.147 --> 30:47.628
HOW ABOUT THE BABY?

30:49.673 --> 30:51.501
THE BABY'S GOOD.

30:51.501 --> 30:54.069
SHE'S, UM....

30:54.069 --> 30:58.247
SHE'S IN HER INCUBATOR,
AND, UM...

30:58.247 --> 31:01.947
THEY'RE TAKING CARE
OF HER RIGHT NOW.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.427
I WAS SO WORRIED.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.647
TYPICAL STUFF.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.736
REALLY?

31:10.651 --> 31:13.480
GOD, I'M SO SLEEPY.

31:15.264 --> 31:16.918
HOW'S SHE DOING?

31:19.094 --> 31:20.922
OK.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.316
YOU TELL US.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.492
WELL, I GOT YOUR
TEST RESULTS BACK,

31:25.492 --> 31:28.016
AND THERE
IS SOME IMPROVEMENT.

31:28.016 --> 31:31.890
YOUR PLATELET COUNT'S UP.
YOUR LIVER FUNCTIONS
ARE SLIGHTLY BETTER.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.543
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

31:33.543 --> 31:36.546
SO I'M CAUTIOUS,
BUT OPTIMISTIC.

31:36.546 --> 31:39.158
HOW ABOUT THAT?

31:39.158 --> 31:40.811
MMM.

31:48.428 --> 31:51.170
I'M GONNA
GO BACK TO SLEEP NOW.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.432
OK.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.222
HOW'S THE BABY?

32:00.222 --> 32:02.659
SHE'S SMALL, CHARLIE.

32:02.659 --> 32:05.749
RIGHT NOW SHE'S
HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE
BREATHING ON HER OWN.

32:05.749 --> 32:08.013
WE HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO LOWER
THE LEVEL OF OXYGEN

32:08.013 --> 32:09.579
IN HER RESPIRATOR.

32:11.581 --> 32:12.756
RIGHT.

32:12.756 --> 32:15.411
I CAN'T PREDICT.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.375
YOU MADE THE RIGHT
CHOICE, YOU KNOW?

32:23.593 --> 32:25.726
REALLY?

32:25.726 --> 32:29.599
IF WE
HAD WAITED ANOTHER DAY,
SHE MIGHT HAVE DIED.

32:29.599 --> 32:32.167
REMEMBER THAT.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.275
HELLO?

32:53.275 --> 32:54.276
OH, GOD.

32:54.276 --> 32:55.364
HELLO?

32:55.364 --> 32:56.975
HEY. HEY, IT'S ME.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.499
GOD, I WENT LOOKING
FOR YOU.

32:59.499 --> 33:01.109
WHY'D YOU DISAPPEAR
LIKE THAT?

33:01.109 --> 33:03.633
OH, I'M--I'M SORRY.
I TOOK A CAB HOME.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.679
I COULD HAVE DRIVEN YOU.

33:05.679 --> 33:08.508
I WAS COMING BACK
HERE TO GET A COUPLE
OF HOURS SLEEP ANYWAY.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.119
YOU OK?
