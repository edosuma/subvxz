What are you doing
up there? You scared me.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.988
Just admiring the view.
You want coffee?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.697
Yeah.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.516
- Are you thinking about home?
- Yeah.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.727
- I guess you miss it.
- The bush? A bit.

04:25.849 --> 04:29.399

the bar at Walkabout Creek right now,

04:29.561 --> 04:32.531
gazing across at Wally
and Nugget and Donk.

04:34.691 --> 04:38.070
Or I could be here looking
at you. No contest.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.408
Actually, I was thinking
about looking for a job.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.913
You're kidding.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.204
No. A man can't stay
on holidays forever.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.296

managed okay so far.

I would've started looking
for a job last week,

his mysterious twin brother.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.186

- On TV. <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

have to get you a job!

throw. Could you show him? Huh?

05:19.361 --> 05:20.362
Um...

05:20.445 --> 05:22.664
You can go play.
I've got to go to work.

- Here it is.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.126
Yeah. Right. That's a rabbit.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.425
You take the rabbit, put it
down over there somewhere

05:33.500 --> 05:34.843
- then get right out of the way.
- Okay.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.340

- Yup.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.970
Don't miss, Mick.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.112
- Any good?
- That was the best, Mick.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.204
Know how come he can
throw like that?

06:03.280 --> 06:06.625
In the bushes, if you miss, you don't
eat. Isn't that right, Mick?

06:06.783 --> 06:10.959
That's right. But that's only half of it.
First, you gotta find the animals.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.252
Here. What's this?

06:14.541 --> 06:17.636
- A snake. That's a snake trail.
- Quick.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.047
Snakes are good eating.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.090
What's this one?

06:26.803 --> 06:30.057
- That's a goanna, a real big lizard.
- Right.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.394
You can eat it, but it tastes
like shit, right, Mick?

06:33.560 --> 06:37.064
Yeah... Here's another
one, real quick.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.947

- Bye, Mick. Bye.
- See you later. Bye-bye.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.163
- See you later!
- Bye!

06:53.330 --> 06:56.584

- That was good, right?

- Hiya, Mick.

- Just a beer, mate.

Looking for some kind of a job.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.319

07:27.614 --> 07:30.208
That's enough job
hunting for one day.

- Yo, Mick, my man!
- G'day, Leroy.

07:34.704 --> 07:37.583
- So, like, you're looking for work?
- Hmm. Kinda.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.218
Well, then look no further.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.927
- I can get you into something sweet.
- Great.

then we'll talk some business.

Okay.

Hey.

I noticed you're getting
pretty tight with Leroy.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.609
Yeah, nice fella.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.817
Let me warn you, he's a bad dude.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.904
He's into some pretty heavy shit.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.616
- Leroy? Seems harmless enough.
- Just so you know.

08:08.780 --> 08:12.660
Yo, Mick, let's walk.
Less ears on the street.

supply business going, right?

08:32.303 --> 08:37.058
- Hey, like you will work for me.
- Oh. What would I be doing?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.403
- Delivering stuff.
- Stuff?

08:49.821 --> 08:53.871
This is just between you and me.
This goes no further, right?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.251
Right.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.884
Stationery.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.215
- Stationery?
- Shh!

09:07.964 --> 09:12.219
You know, pens, erasers,
office supplies.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.982
- And that's heavy shit?
- No, man, it ain't.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.318
I'm strictly legit.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.855
But when you have a
name like Leroy Brown,

09:23.938 --> 09:26.316
people expect you to be bad.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.151
You know, like the song.

Oh, right!

Hey. You want the job?

Well, I don't know, Leroy. Don't
really know what I wanna do yet.

09:53.176 --> 09:56.020
Okay. When you make up your
mind, you let me know.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.273
Okay.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.355

convincing. I think I'll test it.

I when you two broke up?

42:20.496 --> 42:23.124
Yeah, but I don't understand
how these people think.

42:23.291 --> 42:26.170
I need someone who's road wise.

42:28.463 --> 42:29.965
Road wise.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.392
Let's go.

42:41.642 --> 42:44.896

the wheels are out back.

42:46.189 --> 42:47.691
I'm cool.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.530
I'm cool.

43:10.671 --> 43:14.050
You mustn't let these minor
disruptions ruin your appetite.

43:15.426 --> 43:19.397
Try the lobster. I had it flown
in from Maine this morning.

43:21.099 --> 43:23.477
There's nothing wrong with
the food, it's the company.

43:46.249 --> 43:48.047
There's TV cameras,

43:49.127 --> 43:51.004

43:52.547 --> 43:55.551
They're gonna know you're
there before you do.

43:58.052 --> 44:00.726
Maybe we should just
call the police.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.019
Mick.

44:04.100 --> 44:06.899
Guys like this own cops.

44:08.229 --> 44:12.359
And even if the guys you call are
straight, what are they gonna do?

44:12.984 --> 44:15.954
Come in here with their sirens
wailing and their guns blazing?

44:16.028 --> 44:19.328
She'll be dead in two
seconds, if she's still alive.

44:26.539 --> 44:28.166
She's still alive.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.711
How do you know that?

44:32.670 --> 44:35.765
'Cause that's the only way
I can see her. Up here.

44:36.966 --> 44:42.939
If I even start to think she's hurt, my
guts twist up, I can't think straight,

44:43.097 --> 44:45.065
and I'm no good to her.

45:06.787 --> 45:10.837
- So, what do we do now?
- We need some kind of distraction.

- Leroy.

46:10.226 --> 46:14.527
I would consider it a personal
favor if you'll hear my man here.

46:19.485 --> 46:22.455
- You're the crocodile man, ain't you?
- Yeah.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.575
I've seen you around.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.463
- I'm Rat.
- Hey, Rat.

46:32.999 --> 46:35.377
What do you want, crocodile man?

46:36.210 --> 46:38.383
I've got a problem.
I need your help.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.550
Well, you've come
to the right place.

46:42.258 --> 46:44.352
That's what we're here for, huh?

46:44.427 --> 46:45.428
Yeah.

46:46.554 --> 46:48.022
Nice jacket.

46:51.225 --> 46:52.772
How can we be of service?

47:05.114 --> 47:09.415
Well, these heavy dudes
kidnapped my woman.

47:10.077 --> 47:12.125
They're holding her
prisoner in a big mansion

47:12.204 --> 47:13.672
and I'm gonna bust her out.

47:14.332 --> 47:16.050

47:16.751 --> 47:19.925
Lots of guys with machine
guns, shit like that?

47:21.589 --> 47:22.761
Probably.

47:23.591 --> 47:26.595
So, you want us to charge
down the guns, huh?

47:27.303 --> 47:29.806
Death before dishonor,
all that stuff?

47:29.889 --> 47:31.106
No.

47:31.265 --> 47:32.945
I'm the only one that's
gonna get shot at.

47:35.603 --> 47:38.482
What I want from you is a
distraction, so I can get in.

47:40.649 --> 47:43.368
So, what's in it for us?

47:45.654 --> 47:49.204
Leroy tells me that your gang is
the coolest gang in New York.

47:49.283 --> 47:50.604
- That's right.

- We didn't do nothin'.

48:02.338 --> 48:04.261
We was here all night.

48:08.511 --> 48:10.934
That's what you call cool, is it?

48:17.269 --> 48:20.398
So tomorrow, if someone
asks you the same question,

48:20.481 --> 48:22.984
you can say,
"We didn't do nothin'."

48:25.027 --> 48:27.200
Or you can say, "We went
out to Long Island"

48:27.321 --> 48:29.824

storm a fortress."

48:39.291 --> 48:42.795

watch me get my head blown off.

What are your chances?

48:47.133 --> 48:48.385
Fair.

48:48.676 --> 48:51.850
What are your chances of getting
outta here with that jacket on?

49:02.398 --> 49:03.695
Better than average.

- Hmm. 'Cause I own it, I guess.
- You own it?

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:05.244
Yeah, an uncle of mine
left it to me years ago.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.326
How big is Mick's Place?

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:13.123
It's not very big. You could walk
across it in three or four days.

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:19.721

miles up here is a hobby farm.

swamps and rocky mountains.

around here are mosquitoes.

have some redeeming features.

gonna help us find him.

we pick us up another tracker.

It's just a python, you big girl.

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:18.194
Yeah, well, see how you like it if
someone comes running out of the dark

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:19.817
and throws one at you.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:25.115
- Dundee was here, in the camp?
- Yeah. He ran straight through.

01:29:25.443 --> 01:29:27.946
And you didn't even get a shot off?

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.750
Well, he came out of nowhere.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:37.456
And he moved like lightning, and...

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.592
And there was no sound.

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.470
No sound at all.

01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:46.305
(SQUAWKING)

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:51.137
Dundee's some sort of
a ghost or something.

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:54.936
This Dundee likes to
play games, Miguel.

01:29:57.183 --> 01:30:00.778
Maybe we teach him some good
games when it gets light.

01:30:03.023 --> 01:30:04.240
(LAUGHS)

01:30:15.201 --> 01:30:16.202
(MIGUEL SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:30:16.786 --> 01:30:18.663
Come on, Jose, get up.

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:20.123
(MIGUEL GASPS)

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:30.596
I told you. Black magic.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:35.146
Crap magic.

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:38.142
Sweep the area, and stick together.

01:30:38.516 --> 01:30:40.814
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:47.192
You!

01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:52.121
He didn't fly in
here and take Jose.

01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:56.376
There must be tracks. Find them.

01:30:56.534 --> 01:30:57.535
(GROANS)

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.381
Hey.

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:12.555
You thinking what I'm thinking?

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:15.183
We're headed in the
right direction, mate.

01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:17.976
- Let's get the hell out of this.
- You got it.

01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:48.086
Jaba Point?

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:53.430
You want me to lead
them to Jaba Point?

01:31:55.093 --> 01:31:56.310
Got it.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.561
Oh.

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:08.239
I got it.

01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:11.777
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay.

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:19.452
Well, I think we'd better get the
others, now I know where he's headed.

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:23.751
Jaba Point, because there's
fresh water there and caves.

01:32:26.833 --> 01:32:28.301
What makes you so sure?

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:33.049
Because I understand
how the bastard thinks.

01:32:34.132 --> 01:32:35.600
I taught him.

01:32:40.597 --> 01:32:42.474
And now I owe him one.

01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:47.483
We'll see.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.482
You stay in front of me,

01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:53.617
- bushman.
- Okay.

01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:27.102
- How are you holding up, soldier?
- Tired. A little scared.

01:33:27.644 --> 01:33:29.738
But I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:31.190
Fun, isn't it?

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:33.024
- Fun?
- Yeah.

01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:34.280
(WHISTLING)

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:43.035
Now you can get some sleep.
Relief watch has arrived.

01:33:47.622 --> 01:33:49.875
- Charlie, thanks for coming, mate.
- Hello, Mick.

01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:51.794
Telephone call.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.758
Sue, this is Charlie.

01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:57.177
And Diamond.

01:33:58.216 --> 01:34:00.469
Crikey, Diamond, you
must have a tapeworm!

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:02.930
Every time I see you, you've
got food in your hand.

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:04.055
(LAUGHS)

01:34:06.724 --> 01:34:09.227
We've been here since first light.

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:13.440
The two brothers are over there,
looking out for them other fellas.

01:34:13.606 --> 01:34:16.780
You keep an eye on this lot.
I'm gonna go after Wally.

01:34:16.943 --> 01:34:18.445
Okay, mate.

01:34:23.741 --> 01:34:25.209
Can I help?

01:34:25.952 --> 01:34:28.330
Well, I really wanted
to get ahead of Wally.

01:34:28.413 --> 01:34:31.462
I know, a sheila would
only slow you down.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:33.334
Mick.

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:36.133
Be careful. This isn't a game.

01:34:37.964 --> 01:34:39.216
It is to me.

01:34:59.944 --> 01:35:00.945
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.908
No, mate. We just hold them.

01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:08.791
What did he say?

01:35:10.663 --> 01:35:13.132
He wants to know if we're
allowed to eat these men.

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:15.710
(GROANS)

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:38.366
We made the right decision,
mate. Stuff the money.

01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:42.325
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I've had
a bad feeling about this

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:44.656
ever since that old black
tracker walked off.

01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:45.782
(LAUGHS)

01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:49.912
You know, I thought that greaser
really did turn into a goanna.

01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:54.958
Erskine?

01:35:58.461 --> 01:35:59.883
Erskine?

01:36:03.716 --> 01:36:05.434
Don't fool around.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.012
Erskine!

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:31.836
He's headed for Jaba
Point, that's for sure.

01:36:32.245 --> 01:36:35.419
We cross here. You lead the
way, amigo, we'll cover you.

01:36:36.708 --> 01:36:37.925
Yeah.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:56.561
(SCREAMS)

01:37:19.792 --> 01:37:22.045
We don't need him now, anyway.

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:24.805
He's already shown us
the way to Jaba Point.

01:37:28.718 --> 01:37:30.595
We'll cross over here.

01:37:42.774 --> 01:37:43.775
(GASPS)

01:37:45.777 --> 01:37:46.778
(LAUGHS)

01:37:46.861 --> 01:37:48.784
I knew it was you all the time.

01:37:49.447 --> 01:37:52.701
First you shoot my head,
now you try to drown me.

01:37:52.784 --> 01:37:55.958
- You've been hit.
- It's only a scratch, mate.

01:37:57.497 --> 01:37:58.937
Listen, don't put
that in the water,

01:37:58.956 --> 01:38:00.676
'cause there might be
real crocs down there.

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.676
Where do you think
I got this fella?

01:38:03.836 --> 01:38:05.258
In here.

01:38:08.966 --> 01:38:12.186
- Should have seen your face, Wal.
- What was the matter with it?

01:38:12.345 --> 01:38:13.813
- You shit yourself.
- I did not!

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:15.231
- Yes, you did.
- No, I did not.

01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:17.729
- You didn't know it was me.
- Yeah, I did!

01:38:34.659 --> 01:38:36.377
G'day. Want a cold one?

01:38:37.495 --> 01:38:39.873
- Who the hell are you?
- Call me Nugget.

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:41.771
I've been looking
for Walter Reilly.

01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:46.012
Haven't seen him around, have you?

01:38:47.672 --> 01:38:49.712
You should have brought a
gun instead of beer, mate.

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:54.392
Nah, I don't need a
gun. I've got a Donk.

01:38:56.347 --> 01:38:57.348
(LAUGHS)

01:38:59.058 --> 01:39:00.776
You've got a what?

01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:04.526
Donk.

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:06.190
(GRUNTS)

01:39:25.209 --> 01:39:27.712
Walter! Over here!

01:39:28.379 --> 01:39:33.601
There you are! I was just making
sure that nobody followed me.

01:39:33.759 --> 01:39:37.229
- How'd you get away?
- Well, it was a piece of cake really.

01:39:37.388 --> 01:39:42.064
It was just a question of timing,
'cause Mick and I had this plan.

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:44.611
- You've been shot again.
- No, that's Mick's.

01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:46.397
- What?
- No...(CHUCKLES)

01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:48.529
He's all right.
It's just a scratch.

01:39:48.608 --> 01:39:49.655
Where is he?

01:39:49.734 --> 01:39:53.455
He's leading those other two
mongrels up to Jaba Point.

01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:55.531
That's mountain goat country,

01:39:55.615 --> 01:40:00.416
so he's gonna have a
picnic with those two!

01:40:03.414 --> 01:40:05.963
Sue, what are you doing?
Mick told us to wait here.

01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:09.512
Mick thinks this is some big game.
Rico didn't come here for a picnic.

01:40:09.587 --> 01:40:10.679
Which way is it?

01:40:14.592 --> 01:40:17.095
Well, I'll have to go with you.

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:31.944
Are you really enjoying that?

01:40:34.612 --> 01:40:36.580
Nah. Needs garlic.

01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:00.471
(THUDDING)

01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:04.817
(GUNSHOTS)

01:41:16.362 --> 01:41:19.536
It's time we stopped playing
this bushman's game his way.

01:41:20.825 --> 01:41:22.498
What do you mean?

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:28.841
This man can take us
anytime he wants to.

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:32.044
No.

01:41:33.170 --> 01:41:34.513
Now we finish it.

01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:38.510
Think! When we were children,

01:41:39.468 --> 01:41:42.062
did you chase a snake
into the cane fields?

01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:49.024
Move to those rocks and wait.

01:42:52.249 --> 01:42:53.250
(COUGHS)

01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:57.263

01:43:07.807 --> 01:43:08.808
(COUGHS)

01:43:52.643 --> 01:43:54.145
G'day, <i>amigo</i>.

01:44:04.530 --> 01:44:06.328
Take your pants off.

01:44:50.659 --> 01:44:52.286
SUE: He's got Mick!

01:44:56.874 --> 01:44:57.875
(GUNSHOT)

01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:08.511
(GUNSHOT)

01:45:11.347 --> 01:45:12.348
(GUNSHOT)

01:45:15.684 --> 01:45:17.186
Mick. (GASPS)

01:45:24.652 --> 01:45:25.653
(GASPS)

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:57.693
If Mick want his clothes back,

01:45:57.768 --> 01:46:00.396
he can climb down there and
get it his bloody self.

01:46:02.857 --> 01:46:04.074
What?

01:46:08.612 --> 01:46:10.159
Mick's clothes.

01:46:11.407 --> 01:46:15.287
We swapped it with that bastard,
so we can flush the other fella out.

01:46:15.452 --> 01:46:17.955
Plan was working till you
turned up and shot Mick.

01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:27.927
That's not Mick?

01:46:31.135 --> 01:46:34.605
'Course not.
There's Mick over there.

01:46:41.145 --> 01:46:42.146
(GASPS)

01:47:04.168 --> 01:47:06.796
Mick's bloody lucky you
can't shoot straight, Wal.

01:47:15.804 --> 01:47:17.772
You ready to go home now?

01:47:17.848 --> 01:47:19.270
I am home.
