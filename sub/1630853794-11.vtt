WEBVTT

00:19.561 --> 00:22.689
- We both moved to Metropolis
at the same time.
- On the same block.

00:22.772 --> 00:26.401
- And for three years, we both
worked on the 16th floor--
- 17th floor.

00:26.484 --> 00:30.238
- ...at the<i> Daily Planet</i> where--
- I was a beat reporter
covering City Hall.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.990
Yes, you were.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.284
- And I was on the sports desk
covering baseball.
- Football.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.827
Right, right, right.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.996
- For three years, we never met.
- Three whole years.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.039
Then one day, I was
on the F train
to get a blowout,

00:40.123 --> 00:42.667
and Metallo derailed my train.
Sent it airborne.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.588
So I, uh... [laughs]
So I caught that train
and set it down

00:46.671 --> 00:48.965
on top of the LexCorp building
just to talk to her.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.300
Yes, you did.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.718
I had to reschedule
my hair appointment.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.936
[Harley]<i> Holy shit.</i>
<i>Do I love Valentine's Day?</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:05.398
<i>Not only is it the gushiest,</i>
<i>mushiest, most romantic</i>
<i>day of the year,</i>

01:05.482 --> 01:07.525
<i>but for 24 hours,</i>
<i>you have a bulletproof excuse</i>

01:07.609 --> 01:11.821
<i>for doing super cheesy shit</i>
<i>for your partner.</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:15.033
<i>You can eat as much chocolate</i>
<i>as you want, no judgment.</i>

01:15.116 --> 01:17.076
<i>And it's super fucking</i>
<i>cold in February,</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:21.247
<i>so it's the perfect</i>
<i>excuse to snuggle.</i>

01:21.331 --> 01:24.751
[sighs dramatically]
<i>What's not to love</i>
<i>about Valentine's Day?</i>

01:24.834 --> 01:28.963
Oh, I don't know.
It's just one of the most
egregiously wasteful holidays

01:29.047 --> 01:31.007
in terms of nonbiodegradable
packaging.

01:31.090 --> 01:34.594
Not to mention, an annual mass
genocide for roses.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.346
I could go on.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.264
Oh, come on, Ive.
This is our very first
Valentine's Day together.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.518
Look, turn off
the jazz documentary
and let's go out.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.353
Sweetie, I'm only
on episode 11.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.522
Fats Waller hasn't even
gotten fat yet.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.940
I promise, if you
let me have this one,

01:47.023 --> 01:48.525
I will never bring it up again.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.693
You will absolutely
bring it up every year.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.070
Yeah, but with less gusto.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.239
Fine, fine.
Honey, fine, fine.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.740
I'm saying, "fine."
Look at me.
I'm saying fine.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.827
Just as long as it's,
you know, low-key.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.246
Fine. We'll have a quiet dinner
for two at Mama Macaroni's,

02:01.329 --> 02:04.874
where the breadstick basket,
much like my love for you,
is bottomless.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.251
Uh, you got me there.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.877
[sighs] All right, fine.
Let me, let me change out

02:07.961 --> 02:10.505
of my bingeing sweats
and we'll get out of here.

02:13.132 --> 02:14.175
[guffaws]

02:14.259 --> 02:16.177
It is the feast
of St. Valentine,

02:16.261 --> 02:21.766
and I, [in sing-song voice]
Clayface, have met
a special someone online.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.018
Dude, that's literally
Jason Momoa.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.478
You're getting catfished.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.565
Jerry from Hoboken, New Jersey
begs to differ.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.401
Awesome. So look, if he does
end up murdering you,

02:31.484 --> 02:33.111
I'm not gonna identify
your corpse unless

02:33.194 --> 02:35.488
I'm, like, in the area
and it's really convenient.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.366
Who is pumped
for the best VD ever?

02:38.449 --> 02:40.243
I mean, ugh, look,
you know what I meant.

02:40.326 --> 02:44.581
Mm-hmm.
Honey, I am so pumped
because it's gonna be great.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.999
It's not gonna be great.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.042
It's gonna be the best
Valentine's Day ever!

02:48.126 --> 02:50.420
Right, because it's so low-key.

02:50.503 --> 02:51.379
Uh-huh.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.468
[humming]

02:58.845 --> 03:00.972
So, Clock King tells me
you're going

03:01.055 --> 03:05.768
to a painting and
wine-drinking event tonight
for Valentine's Day.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.271
Mmm, that sounds
colorful and fun.

03:08.354 --> 03:12.859
Ugh. Yeah, well, Clocky
likes it and it basically
guarantees sex,

03:12.942 --> 03:14.819
so I'll suffer through it.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.448
- I wish I had a special someone
with whom to spend the evening.
- [sighs]

03:18.531 --> 03:20.116
Oh, here we go.

03:20.199 --> 03:23.620
I'm on all the dating apps,
but haven't swiped right once.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.788
I can't get past the profiles.

03:25.872 --> 03:30.877
Does no one understand
correct grammar,
dangling modifiers,

03:30.960 --> 03:35.548
sentence fragments,
using the word "anyways"
as a transition...

03:35.632 --> 03:37.050
It's "anyway"!

03:37.133 --> 03:38.968
There's no "S"!

03:39.052 --> 03:41.471
And as you know,
nothing turns me off more

03:41.554 --> 03:44.307
than reckless disregard
for language.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.516
Does anyone know that?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.143
You do now.

03:47.226 --> 03:52.690
"Anyway," it appears
I'll be spending
my Valentine's alone

03:52.774 --> 03:57.487
in darkness and solitude,
where I was born.

03:57.570 --> 04:03.076
Unless that painting
and wining event
has, uh, any openings...

04:03.159 --> 04:03.993
No.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.329
Mmm.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.332
[Poison Ivy]
<i>♪ Mama Macaroni</i>
<i>Get in my mouth ♪</i>

04:09.415 --> 04:11.376
[vocalizing]

04:11.459 --> 04:13.169
I have got to hand
it to you, Harls.

04:13.252 --> 04:16.673
You've managed to keep
V-Day low-key.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.007
I appreciate that.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.510
Aw, I'm really best
at listening, ain't I?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.345
In regards to tonight?

04:23.346 --> 04:24.722
[hesitates] Yes.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.891
Ah,<i> signoras,</i>
it is your lucky night.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.352
You have been selected
to sample a new item

04:29.435 --> 04:31.312
from the chef's
experimental menu.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.690
- This is a vegan La-zeat-balls.
- Ooh, yeah!

04:33.773 --> 04:37.402
They are a lasagna
inside a baked ziti
inside a fried meatball.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.321
Also known as
the Tuscan turducken.

04:40.405 --> 04:45.201
What...
Oh, fuck my taste buds.
The fuck?

04:45.284 --> 04:48.121
Ive, what are the odds
that your three favorite dishes

04:48.204 --> 04:50.415
ate each other and now,
you get to eat that?

04:50.498 --> 04:52.709
Harley, you're gonna have
to get in on this
before I inhale it,

04:52.792 --> 04:55.712
'cause it's just like...
It's like<i> Under the Tuscan Sun</i>

04:55.795 --> 04:57.714
is, like, playing inside
my mouth right now

04:57.797 --> 05:00.216
and we're, like,
in the third act where,
like, Diane Lane, just, like,

05:00.299 --> 05:03.261
met the American writer
and, like, they leave it
open-ended but you know

05:03.344 --> 05:06.180
everything's going to work out
which is so artful and--

05:06.264 --> 05:10.518
Mmm. Goddamn da ding-dong,
these are fucking good.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.477
[door slams open]

05:13.062 --> 05:14.564
Ahhh!

05:14.647 --> 05:18.693
All right. Sorry to crash
Valentine's Day, lovebirds.

05:18.776 --> 05:22.613
But if the chef
don't hand over his recipe
for those La-zeat-balls,

05:22.697 --> 05:25.408
we'll blow the whole<i> ristorante</i>
back to the old country.

05:25.491 --> 05:29.579
[stammering] Please,
just take the recipe,
and don't hurt nobody, huh?

05:29.662 --> 05:33.583
In the name of the father,
the son, and the Mama Macaroni.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.251
Pleasure doing
business with ya.

05:35.334 --> 05:38.129
Come on, boys.
<i>Andiamo-ce.</i>

05:38.212 --> 05:40.798
- [both groan in disgust]
- [Poison Ivy] Go, go, go.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.221
Okay. We have to do something.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.266
That recipe cannot fall
into the wrong hands.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.143
It's just too damn delicious.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.522
Getaway car is headed
toward Robinson Park.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.108
Ha-ha! Wrong move,
you dipshits.

05:59.192 --> 06:03.029
You just picked
the most densely-planted park
in all of Gotham.

06:03.112 --> 06:05.490
- Hyah!
- [horse neighs]

06:05.573 --> 06:06.574
[Poison Ivy] Whoo!

06:07.700 --> 06:08.534

06:30.890 --> 06:33.309
Please, ladies. Don't kill us.

06:33.392 --> 06:37.647
Fork it over. Fork over
the La-zeat-balls recipe,
you fuckstick.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.232
We were just the middle men.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.110
[stammers] We was hired
by the CEO of Luxor Oil.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.987
Yeah, his appetite for
unsustainable fossil fuel

06:45.071 --> 06:48.825
and new takes on traditional
Italian cooking
are both insatiable.

06:48.908 --> 06:49.992
[helicopter whirring]

06:52.703 --> 06:56.666
Turn over the recipe
for the La-zeat-balls, Ivy,

06:56.749 --> 06:59.794
or else the love
of your life dies.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.755
And on Valentine's Day,
no less.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.173
[laughing maniacally]

07:08.219 --> 07:09.345
Ahhh!

07:09.428 --> 07:12.181
That's right.
I just gave you the bird.

07:12.265 --> 07:16.811
As in whirlybird,
which is another name
for helicop--

07:16.894 --> 07:18.396
You know what? Just never mind.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.190
It doesn't matter.
I'm... I'm alive,
and you're dead.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.441
Oh, my God, Ive. It's over.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.236
You saved me. You saved us all.

07:26.904 --> 07:31.450
Wait, Harley.
Did... did you stage all
of this for me?

07:31.534 --> 07:33.244
- Yeah.
- I thought it was the only way

07:33.327 --> 07:36.581
you'd let me give you
the best Valentine's Day ever.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.749
What about the oil exec?

07:38.833 --> 07:40.960
That was actually
the CEO of Luxor Oil.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.879
I had him shipped in,
special for you,

07:42.962 --> 07:44.630
and told him I'd kill him
unless he pointed a gun at me.
[chuckles]

07:44.714 --> 07:46.382
I know it wasn't exactly
low-key like you asked for.

07:46.465 --> 07:50.011
- But, you know, it was, uh--
- I love you so much, peanut.

07:50.094 --> 07:53.097
That's your cue, Etrigan.

the best Valentine's Day ever?

08:13.159 --> 08:15.912
It's so, so great.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.664
Great.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.251
Yeah, great. Sure.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.755
A while back, around 2500 BC,
when I went by Prince Khufu,

08:25.838 --> 08:27.757
I was in the market
having beers

08:27.840 --> 08:30.176
with a buddy of mine
named Asim, and this
gorgeous Princess Chay-Ara

08:30.259 --> 08:32.803

with this whole entourage.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.096
[giggles] It's me.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.431
And I say to Asim,

08:35.514 --> 08:36.933
"You see that woman?

08:37.016 --> 08:38.851
- I'm going to marry her."
- [giggles]

08:38.935 --> 08:41.354
Now, this was ancient Egypt,
so she didn't have
much of a choice.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.397
- Yeah, no choice, no choice.
- Two weeks later,
we were married,

08:43.481 --> 08:45.274
- and it lasted about 40 years.
- Lovely years.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.193
- And then we were
murdered by Hittites.
- Murdered horribly.

08:47.276 --> 08:50.363
- But we were reincarnated
and found each other again.
- We did.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.240
- We married. We died.
- Yeah.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.616
- We got reincarnated.
- Yup.

08:53.699 --> 08:54.951
- Time and again--
- Again.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.036
...we always managed
to find each other.

08:57.119 --> 09:00.748
And here we are,
5,000 years later,
still together.

- Jerry, it is I, Clayface.

09:19.308 --> 09:23.604
So eager to meet
you in the flesh,
yet, uh, mystified

09:23.688 --> 09:27.233
that the address seems
to be in Crime Alley.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.693
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

09:28.776 --> 09:30.820

No, that's not it.
Wait a minute.

Vegan coffee shop,
vegan coffee shop.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.340
Wait a minute.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.342
All coffee is vegan.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.885

Well, that was a piece of piss.

Oh, dear.

Are you bloody serious, mate?

10:22.621 --> 10:24.582
You don't have any cash.

10:24.665 --> 10:30.921
Just two nosebleed seat tickets
to some shitty show
at Gotham Amphitheater.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.882
I was going to surprise you.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.509
Well, now I'm defo
gonna kill ya.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.595

10:39.722 --> 10:41.098
Ah! Too-roo.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.730
[groans softly]
I'm so glad you
talked me into that.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.273
That... What a great night.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.233
Yeah. No. I'm glad
you thought it was great.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.235
Which is a word reserved
for things that are the very
best they can be.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.905
Like how a Greatest Hits album
is full of a band's best songs

10:55.988 --> 10:58.074
or how the Great Depression
was the best depression. So...

10:58.157 --> 10:59.408
Uh...

10:59.492 --> 11:01.118
Wait, what the fuck
are you talking about?

11:01.202 --> 11:03.079
I just wanted to throw you
the best V-Day you ever had.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.206
Oh, my God!
Would you look at me,
you psycho?

11:05.289 --> 11:09.668
It was the greatest
Valentine's Day
that I have ever had.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.253
Ugh, now I'm going to go
take a shower

11:11.337 --> 11:14.090
because I'm covered
in brimstone soot from hell

11:14.173 --> 11:17.468
thanks to Etrigan's
gorgeous fireworks.

11:17.551 --> 11:18.469
Mm-kay?

11:18.552 --> 11:19.553
Yeah, yeah, cool. Okay, cool.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.513
Sure. Mm-hmm.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.438
[giggles]
Happy Valentine's Day.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.525
- Oh, nice night for you.
- [woman giggles]

11:37.571 --> 11:40.074
Stupid Valentine's Day.

11:44.703 --> 11:45.830
- [woman] Hey!
- Huh?

11:45.913 --> 11:47.164
- Ooh.
- You get lost?

11:47.248 --> 11:49.959
Yeah, my GPS took
me a block away, too.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.836
[sputters] What?

11:51.919 --> 11:53.254
Come on, we're... we're late.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.426
[hesitating] Okay, why not?

12:01.303 --> 12:04.432
- Uh, name's Betty, by the way.
- I am Bane.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.809
I like it.
Mine's a stage name too.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.644
[whispers]
Real name's Elizabeth.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.438
So look, this client
is pretty demanding.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.106
He knows if you're
holding back on him.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.983
So, let's get
hypothetical here.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.610
If you're spanking me
or humiliating me
or torching my anus,

12:16.694 --> 12:18.821
am I gonna feel it
in the morning?

12:18.904 --> 12:22.658
It would be extremely
painful for you.

12:22.741 --> 12:23.993
You're gonna do great.
[slaps]

12:24.076 --> 12:27.037
Um, what exactly
is going on here?

12:27.121 --> 12:29.206
Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.417
Oh, hey. Thank you.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.172
Oh, Steve.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.048
[knocking at door]

12:38.132 --> 12:39.884
Ugh, what now?

12:39.967 --> 12:42.511
Wonder Woman,
Themyscira needs your help.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.264
- What's happened?
- The island is under attack.

12:45.347 --> 12:48.893
- By who?
- Uh, by... by some dudes.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.479
What? There's no men
allowed on Themyscira.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.856
Yeah, exactly.
That's why we're all so pissed.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.608
They all just, like,
landed on the island.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.444
And one of them was like,
"I'm gonna teabag
the fucking...

12:58.527 --> 13:00.863
sacred artifact thing
you guys love."

13:00.946 --> 13:03.699
- The Oculus of the Argo?
- Yes. Exactly. That.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.034
[gasps] It's sacred.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.037
This is what I'm saying.
We gotta get going.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.540
Wait! Why didn't you light
a signal fire to alert me?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.668
We did. But one of those
assholes peed out the fire.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.629
We were all like,
"Dude, what the fuck?

13:16.712 --> 13:18.130
So disrespectful."

13:18.214 --> 13:19.048
Oh.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.138
Wait. This seems odd to me.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.766
Hey, if you don't believe me,
hear it straight
from the Queen.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.810
<i>Help me, Diana.</i>
<i>You're our only hope.</i>

13:31.894 --> 13:34.438
Great Hera! I'm coming.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.945
Thank you, Cameo.
Best 40 bucks I've ever spent.

13:41.028 --> 13:44.865
<i>And may your quinceanera</i>
<i>be suited for the gods.</i>

13:46.450 --> 13:49.370
So, I'm sitting
in my dermatologist's office.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.080
I had a mole
that looked a little weird.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.706
He's a total hypochondriac.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.583
A melanoma is no joke.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.920
[whines and clears throat]
So, anyway, I'm there,

13:58.003 --> 14:02.591
and this one walks in.
And immediately,
I'm like, "Wow--"

14:02.675 --> 14:04.426
I looked awful.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.513
I had literally just been
to hell and back.
I was summoning a succubus.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.224
But to me,
she looked beautiful.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.978
So anyway, I say,
"Hey, any spawns of Satan
come through here?"

14:14.061 --> 14:18.148
And I go, "Well, you're
probably looking
for the law firm next door."

14:18.232 --> 14:19.900
Uh, which, you know,
cheesy joke.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.026
It was cute.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.028
Sometimes I'm cute.
[purrs]

14:25.864 --> 14:27.366
Oh, I am slain.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.284
[groans softly]

14:28.367 --> 14:30.619

14:33.372 --> 14:36.292
Ah! I am slain.
I need help.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.128
No, I am slain and need help.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.380
Oh, my lesser half.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.674
Come, let Daddy reabsorb you.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.050
"Lesser half"? What?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.803
What makes you think
I cannot reabsorb you?

14:47.886 --> 14:50.598
Because your face
is where my ass should be.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.309
I mean, I'm clearly
the dominant half.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.814
Oh, what does it matter?

14:58.897 --> 15:01.191
We are as broken as that rose.

15:01.275 --> 15:06.572
Let us just clasp hands
and reabsorb each other,
and then we will be...

15:06.655 --> 15:08.741
[wails] Alone!

15:08.824 --> 15:11.827
My God, you're right.
Alone.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.621
Forever an outcast.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.997
No one to love.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.874
Or be loved by.

How delightful
that you remember
the song from our childhood!

15:51.075 --> 15:52.368
The one the...

15:52.451 --> 15:54.411
[together] ...handsy pizza guy
used to sing.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.372
- [both laughing]
- Oh.

15:56.455 --> 16:01.418
I have never met anyone
that I connected to so
quickly and completely.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.046
Might I ask,

16:04.129 --> 16:06.715
how do you identify?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.467
You know, sexually.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.762
I identify as fluid.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.263
As do I.

16:19.978 --> 16:20.813
[grunts]

16:22.815 --> 16:24.608
[groaning]

16:26.777 --> 16:28.904
Harley, what the fuck
are you doing?

16:28.987 --> 16:30.197
Stop, wait...

16:30.280 --> 16:32.116
Wait, is this the real
Lasso of Truth?

16:32.199 --> 16:34.910
Oh, wait a second.
Is this the one that you got
from Halloween

16:34.993 --> 16:37.871
when you tried to go as
Wonder Wolf-man
and no one got it?

16:37.955 --> 16:42.251
I was a wolf wearing
a Wonder Woman suit.
It made perfect fucking sense.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.753
But no, this is the real
Lasso of Truth.
I just stole it.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.548
May I ask why you did
this very stupid thing?

16:48.507 --> 16:50.092
Ivy,

16:50.175 --> 16:54.054
was this the best
Valentine's Day
that you have ever had?

16:54.138 --> 16:57.224
Y... No, it was top three.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.183
Bah! Fuck.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.518
I fucking knew it.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.895
Top three, very good.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.480
Let me out of this thing.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.608
Hey, Harley, who cares?

17:06.692 --> 17:10.279
It was a great Valentine's Day.
Great.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.781
[shrieking]
Stop saying things are great.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.867

17:14.950 --> 17:16.910
With the Joker,
every single year,

17:16.994 --> 17:18.662
I made sure
that Valentine's Day was better
than the one before it.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.706
And although my credit score
is now absolute shit

17:20.789 --> 17:24.835
and I am banned for life
from most of Gotham City's
craft supply stores,

17:24.918 --> 17:26.003
[screams] I did it!

17:26.086 --> 17:26.962
Well, guess what?

17:27.045 --> 17:28.714
I'm not the Joker.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.340
I don't give a shit.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.510
I had a splendid, splendid--
That's an okay word, right?

17:33.594 --> 17:36.180
...Valentine's Day
and now, I would love

17:36.263 --> 17:37.723
to end it by bingeing

17:37.806 --> 17:40.476
one of the many fine scripted
or non-scripted shows

17:40.559 --> 17:43.562
that HBO Max has to offer,
then have some sex,

17:43.645 --> 17:45.022
and go to bed.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.733
Like, perfect ending
to a perfect Valentine's Day.

17:47.816 --> 17:48.817

17:48.901 --> 17:50.402
Well, not perfect, right?

17:50.486 --> 17:52.488
[sighs in exasperation] Harley.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.199
Okay, okay. Why don't you
figure out something to watch
while I hit the head?

17:58.410 --> 18:01.663
Just FYI, it's gonna
take a bit, okay?
I ate something weird.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.458
I might have that thing
where my legs fall asleep
and you know the rest.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.339
[sensual rock music playing]

18:10.422 --> 18:14.092
[Bane] So, Betty, uh,
how did you get into this,
uh, line of work?

18:14.176 --> 18:16.053
Well, I used to be
an accountant

18:16.136 --> 18:19.014
and just sitting all day
in those shitty chairs
with no lumbar support...

18:19.097 --> 18:22.893
Oh, my God.
The lumbar, always ignored.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.228
Tell me about it.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.647
They never want to spring
for a good chair.

18:26.730 --> 18:30.359
But you know what
happens when you're not
comfortable at work?

18:30.442 --> 18:31.819
Yeah, productivity goes down.

18:31.902 --> 18:35.739
Exactly.
Penny-wise, pound-foolish.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.533
[laughs]
I feel like I know you.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.618
I was thinking the same.

18:39.701 --> 18:43.038
[stammers] And I hope
this isn't too forward,

18:43.121 --> 18:46.416
but how would you like
to come to my place after this?

18:46.500 --> 18:49.711
[stammering]
But this... Can I?

18:49.795 --> 18:54.049
Yes, I would like that
very much.

18:54.132 --> 18:57.302
Hey, uh, is ignoring me
part of the experience?

18:57.386 --> 19:00.973
Because, if so, it's more
annoying than humiliating.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.892
[shrieking] Shut up!
What are you gonna
do about it,

19:03.976 --> 19:09.147
you baby-dicked piece of shit?
With your tiny penis?

19:09.815 --> 19:10.649
Thank you.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.777
Oh, where'd it go?

19:13.861 --> 19:17.823
I need my electron microscope
if I'm gonna find that nub.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.199
Hey, get in on this, huh?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.910
I mean, I'm looking at it
and, and, uh--

19:21.994 --> 19:24.288
How can you see it?
I can't.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.582
It's so small.

19:26.665 --> 19:31.837
Well, I, I mean, I don't know
if small is the word I would
use or, or, or tight, I don't--

19:31.920 --> 19:33.255
No, she's right.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.257
It looks like one of those
pissing fountain cherubs.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.926
- Go on. Have another look.
- [Bane hesitates]

19:38.010 --> 19:42.848
Damn, it was a genuine pleasure
watching you work, Bane.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.183
Uh, thanks, I guess.

19:45.267 --> 19:50.606
So, we still have a few hours
of Valentine's Day left,
and my offer still stands.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.940
My place or yours?

19:52.024 --> 19:55.027
Hmm... Let's do yours.
My place is a pit.

19:55.110 --> 19:58.030
Well, my place
is covered in cat hair.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.448
So, let's toss a coin?

19:59.531 --> 20:00.657
[both laugh]

20:00.741 --> 20:02.618
I'll call a car.

20:02.701 --> 20:06.955
Hey, uh, did you mean
what you said to that guy
about the size of his penis?

20:07.039 --> 20:11.501
I'm sure he's not
packing the kind of heat
you're packing, big guy.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.963
[laughs nervously]
For sure. Absolutely.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.342
I am surely packing much
more heat than this man who

20:18.425 --> 20:24.681
most people would agree has
a very decently-sized penis.
[laughing nervously]

20:24.765 --> 20:26.725
I can't wait to see for myself.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.310
You and me both.

Hey, why don't
you go ahead and text me
your address?

20:32.356 --> 20:34.983
I just need to make
a quick stop first to, um,

20:35.067 --> 20:38.820
grab a hoagie and carbo-load
for our lovemaking.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.113
Mmm, don't be long.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.282
You'll see how long I am.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.576
[giggles] Oh, my.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.411
Uh, okay.

Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

If you've come here
to feed your foolish vice,

21:05.263 --> 21:08.016
[in normal voice]
it's Valentine's Day.
It's all half price.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.810
I got a specific request
for ya, E-man.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.396
How do I put this?
I'm kind of,
sort of, looking for--

21:12.479 --> 21:13.355
A sex spell.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.898
How'd you know?

21:14.982 --> 21:17.067
Just the bulk
of our business
all year round.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.362
Helping those who
wish to... [chuckling]

21:22.114 --> 21:24.324
Okay. I want to give Ive
the best Valentine's Day
she's ever had.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.744
Which naturally
means the biggest orgasm
she's ever had.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.663

21:29.746 --> 21:31.164

think someone died
and they call the cops.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.625
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, do I know.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.544
I may have just the spell.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.171
And I'll throw in some
cleaner to, you know,
take away the smell.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.800

21:45.470 --> 21:48.056

a power that will
have you both--

Okay, okay.
I get it. I get it.

So what, now I'm like

shall feel divine.

22:07.325 --> 22:10.245

that'll be, uh, $49.99.

22:10.328 --> 22:13.081
Oh, and I think it's
pronounced Zen-day-a.

is this La-zeat-balls

22:29.056 --> 22:32.601
Sorry, babe. Took a little time
to get the trains running.
But run, they did.

22:32.684 --> 22:36.521
Totally thought about
what you said about how
this Valentine's Day was great,

22:36.605 --> 22:37.814
and I should not obsess,

22:37.898 --> 22:39.566
and I think you're right.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.610
Listen, I don't need
to go overboard
and try to woo you.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.070
We just hang out here

22:43.153 --> 22:46.823
and be with each other,
and it will be great.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.951
I'm, like, so
turned on right now.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.703
Oh, you don't wanna
watch a show first?

22:51.787 --> 22:54.331

Um--

24:11.324 --> 24:12.576
Are you saying that was
the best you've ever had?

24:12.659 --> 24:14.161
Not that that matters at all.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.163
We're not saying
what's the best
and not the best.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.165
But if we were ranking things,
which we're not,
would you say that?

24:18.248 --> 24:21.835
Yeah, I... I... I think so.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.837

24:39.769 --> 24:41.605
What the fuck is happening?

24:41.688 --> 24:45.066
Well, I grew up
in the underwater
kingdom of Xebel,

24:45.150 --> 24:47.402
and was raised as an assassin.

24:47.485 --> 24:49.321
Eventually, I was sent
to the surface world

24:49.404 --> 24:51.907
to hunt down
the future monarch of Atlantis.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.491
And I was that future monarch.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.785
Well, clearly,
I failed on my mission.

24:55.869 --> 24:59.289

I can be pretty charming.

24:59.372 --> 25:01.249
She does have
a solid left hook, though.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.920
We got married within a year,
which turned out to be

25:05.003 --> 25:08.465
the only thing in centuries
that could unite
our respective kingdoms.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.843
It just goes to show you
that two parties from two
totally different walks,

can be stronger together.

But I suppose we can
still love each other
and never touch.

25:58.181 --> 26:01.351
It is the way
of the American marriage.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.727

26:29.921 --> 26:31.965
It's an emergency, okay?

26:32.048 --> 26:34.718
Men are from Mars.
Women, Venus. Let me guess.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.553
You want to have
a bigger penis, right?

26:36.636 --> 26:38.013
I... Well...

26:38.096 --> 26:41.516
Yeah, I... I mean, my penis
is actually a good size.

26:41.599 --> 26:45.103
It's just that my body
is actually also
incredibly large.

26:45.186 --> 26:47.814
It's like if you took
Kawhi Leonard's hands

26:47.897 --> 26:50.650

Andre the Giant's body.

this will enlarge.

- Hmm.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.497
[moaning] No!

33:19.580 --> 33:23.292
Brett Goldstein, you deserve
someone who makes you feel

33:23.376 --> 33:26.003
like you've been
fucked by lightning.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.171
[straining]

33:30.675 --> 33:32.510
Maybe they can rebuild it?

33:32.593 --> 33:34.804
All I wanted
for Valentine's Day
was to hang out

33:34.887 --> 33:38.599
in our fucking apartment
and fucking watch TV
and have sex.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.560
But no, it wasn't
enough for you.

33:40.643 --> 33:44.522
And now you've ruined
my favorite restaurant
in all of Gotham City.

33:44.605 --> 33:46.899
I, I think they opened
a second location
in Bludhaven.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.444
You know, you say you wanted
to do something special for me,

33:49.527 --> 33:53.281
but you don't listen
when I try to tell you
what I actually want.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.657
What about what I want?

33:54.741 --> 33:56.451
You wanted to go out.

33:56.534 --> 34:00.121
I said yes, even though
I didn't want to,
because I listened.

34:00.204 --> 34:03.791
I listened to what you wanted.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.960
And I said, "Okay."

34:06.043 --> 34:07.503
I didn't mean
for this to happen,

34:07.587 --> 34:09.005
and because I am not
yet ready

34:09.088 --> 34:11.632
to accept blame
for ruining Valentine's Day,

34:11.716 --> 34:14.469
I am going
to focus on beating
the shit out of Bane.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.345
[roars]

34:16.429 --> 34:18.139
I mean, at least
she's self-aware.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.599
Coming, Harley.

34:19.682 --> 34:21.058
Ahhh!

34:22.226 --> 34:23.853
Oh, my God!

34:23.936 --> 34:28.399
[Bane] I will make
BAFTA-winning love to you,
Brett Goldstein!

34:28.483 --> 34:30.610
How are we gonna move
all those people out of there?

34:30.693 --> 34:34.489
I mean, they paid
120 bucks to see a guy
polish his stupid Emmy.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.074
Do they really need to live?

34:36.157 --> 34:37.450
Ive!

34:37.533 --> 34:38.493
- [Bane groans]
- [Harley and Poison Ivy scream]

34:40.787 --> 34:41.829
[grunting]

34:48.002 --> 34:50.046
[Poison Ivy] Hey, girl, I think
we have only one option.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.090
We have to turn off Bane.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.551
Okay. Bane has to have
listed some turnoffs

34:55.635 --> 34:57.178
on his dating profile.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.722
Favorite TV shows:
the later seasons
of<i> The Office?</i>

34:59.806 --> 35:02.350
What the fuck? What a psycho.

35:02.433 --> 35:05.645
If he liked the<i> Dexter</i>
series finale, I'm, like,
through with him.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.438
Don't worry.
There's a few
other things on here

35:07.522 --> 35:09.148
that might work
to give him a hard-off.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.201
[Clayface]
Your attention, please.

35:20.284 --> 35:23.663
If someone is in need
of an extra ticket
for tonight's performance,

35:23.746 --> 35:29.335
oh, cruel fate has absconded
with my beloved plus-one.

35:29.418 --> 35:30.670
[wails]

35:30.753 --> 35:35.591
But his joy can be yours
for the low price of $80.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.552
Do you think someone
laced our weed?

35:37.635 --> 35:39.762
[Clayface 2]
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

35:39.846 --> 35:43.933
It is the east
and Clayface, the sun.

35:44.016 --> 35:47.103
And there is my moon.

35:47.186 --> 35:50.064
I dare dream your voice
would be accompanied

35:50.147 --> 35:52.316
by your gorgeous countenance.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.820
You and I are so
exactly the same.

35:55.903 --> 35:57.989
I bet we could
finish each other--

35:58.072 --> 35:59.198
Off.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.285
Yes, well, I was going
to say sentences,

36:02.368 --> 36:05.454
but this must be fate,
demanding we be together.

36:05.538 --> 36:06.831
This is so fucking weird.

36:09.125 --> 36:13.421
"So, we'll go no more a roving
So late into the night,

36:13.504 --> 36:16.007
Though the heart
be still as loving,

36:16.090 --> 36:18.384
And the moon
be still as bright.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.595
For the sword
outwears its sheath,"

36:21.262 --> 36:23.264
[groans]

36:24.557 --> 36:26.934
"And the heart
must pause to breathe,

36:27.018 --> 36:29.937
And love itself have rest.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.106
Though the night
was made for loving,

36:32.190 --> 36:34.066
And the day returns too soon,

36:34.150 --> 36:39.447
Yet we'll go no more a roving
By the light of the moon."

36:39.530 --> 36:41.532
So what if we can never touch?

36:41.616 --> 36:43.951
Just knowing we are not
alone in this world,

36:44.035 --> 36:47.413
that I ache for you
the same way that you ache--

36:47.496 --> 36:48.998
- [splattering]
- [both scream]

36:52.460 --> 36:55.588
[screams] No!

36:55.671 --> 37:01.177
You will be bent into positions
you did not know possible,
Brett Goldstein.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.595
[growls]

37:02.678 --> 37:07.016
Everyone, calmly head
for the nearest exit.

37:07.099 --> 37:11.312
Do not gawk at the large
testicles swinging
like wrecking balls.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.774
[screams]

37:16.067 --> 37:17.735
[grunting]

37:17.818 --> 37:19.654
We may have
his turnoffs, honey,

37:19.737 --> 37:23.366
but how the hell
are we gonna get
him to hear them?

37:23.449 --> 37:24.825
We're not. But he is.

37:26.243 --> 37:27.828
Hey, quick question.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.081
Can you grow
to a giant-sized version
of Brett Goldstein,

37:30.164 --> 37:32.333
then start shouting some
of Bane's turnoffs at him

37:32.416 --> 37:34.085
so he stops trying to fuck you?

37:34.168 --> 37:35.670
First of all,

37:35.753 --> 37:37.129
not a quick question.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.674
There are a lot of
problematic things in there.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.677
And secondly, no,
I cannot accommodate you

37:42.760 --> 37:44.971
whilst my heart is broken.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.639
[woman screaming]

37:46.722 --> 37:49.141
Clayface, let me
ask you something.
This is serious, okay?

37:49.225 --> 37:54.397
If Ian Somerhalder could
continue filming Season 5
of<i> Vampire Diaries</i>

37:54.480 --> 37:56.983
after his breakup
with Nina Dobrev,

37:57.066 --> 37:58.901
you can do this.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.195
You can do it.

38:01.278 --> 38:02.405
It's true.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.573
That was some
of his finest work.

38:04.657 --> 38:07.702
I suppose it is the
challenge of a lifetime.

38:07.785 --> 38:11.747
And I would
Stanis-love-sky to do it!

38:16.335 --> 38:18.629
Where did the hell
did you pull that from?

38:18.713 --> 38:23.968
My aunt posted an article about
celeb breakups on Wayneface
the other day, so...

38:25.302 --> 38:26.637
[Bane whimpers]

38:26.721 --> 38:31.934
Do my eyes deceive me
or are you fun-sized?

38:32.018 --> 38:33.769
Eh, start talking
about his turnoffs.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.980
He hates angel hair pasta
and that thing

38:36.063 --> 38:38.649
where you say goodbye
to someone but then you both
walk in the same direction.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.526
He hates that.

38:40.609 --> 38:44.572
Young master Bane,
I know my stubbly, rugged
appearance may belie this,

38:44.655 --> 38:46.949
but I know a thing or two
about love,

38:47.033 --> 38:50.870
and let me assure you,
love is in the eye
of the beholder.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.830
And you don't need to copulate
with the building

38:52.913 --> 38:55.708
until it crumbles
to the ground to let it
know that you love it.

38:55.791 --> 39:00.546
I mean, what is horny,
if not love...

39:00.629 --> 39:05.009
<i>♪ Persevering? ♪</i>

39:05.092 --> 39:06.510
[Bane] Ah. What?

39:06.594 --> 39:09.221
Anyways, I digress.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.932
It's "anyway."

39:12.016 --> 39:14.143
It's not "anyways."

39:14.226 --> 39:18.230
It is? "Anyways" sounds
right to a boy born and raised
in salt-of-the-earth

39:18.314 --> 39:19.732
Sutton, United Kingdom.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.525
That really begs the question.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.444
- Why isn't it "anyways"?
- No.

39:23.527 --> 39:28.824
No, no. God, that's not
the correct usage
of "begs the question."

39:28.908 --> 39:32.661
You're not supposed
to just use it in place
of "raises the question."

39:32.745 --> 39:37.208
It is to be used only
to identify flawed premises,

39:37.291 --> 39:43.923
as in, "The American public's
acceptance of "anyways" because
'everyone does it already'

39:44.006 --> 39:47.468
really begs
the fucking question."

39:47.551 --> 39:50.429
Ahhh! So annoying.

39:50.513 --> 39:54.433
He's getting turned off.
It's working. It's working!

39:54.517 --> 39:56.560
The only thing
I'm certain of now

39:56.644 --> 40:00.189
is that I will never see
anything stupider in my life.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.233
The event promoters
have informed me

40:02.316 --> 40:07.154
that refunds do not apply
to massive homicidal bellends.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.656
I'm so sorry.

40:08.739 --> 40:13.077
I wish I could do something.
I am but one human man.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.871
[Harley] Are you good now?
You gonna stop humping stuff?

40:16.497 --> 40:17.498
Yes.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.333
Thank you for saving me.

40:19.416 --> 40:22.002
Yeah, I don't know
what got into me.

40:22.086 --> 40:27.174
Except for all
that testosterone
and reproductive fluid.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.719
Oh, yeah. See, I got a magic
spell to give Ive the best
orgasm she ever had,

40:30.803 --> 40:33.597
and then her pheromones
exploded everywhere
and made you supes horny.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.432
But I'm really not sure
why you're so giant.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.893
I also got a magic spell
to... [sighs]

40:37.977 --> 40:41.480
do something nice
for someone on Valentine's Day.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.482
Aw, trying to pack
a little more heat, huh?

40:43.566 --> 40:46.986
I packed the appropriate
amount of heat.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.737
[sighs]

40:48.821 --> 40:52.533
This is the second-biggest
Valentine's Day disaster
I've ever had.

40:52.616 --> 40:55.161
[stammers] I mean, pray tell,
what was the first?

40:55.244 --> 40:57.580
When I missed the Season 8
episode of<i> The Office</i>

40:57.663 --> 41:00.749
where Jim goes to Tallahassee
to see Robert California.

41:00.833 --> 41:04.378
God, what the fuck
was even going on
in that show?,

41:04.461 --> 41:08.883
[sighs] I guess it's another
solo V-Day.

41:08.966 --> 41:13.137
Maybe I'll go back
to the pit and cuddle
with a pile of rocks.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.346
[Betty] Want some company?

41:16.432 --> 41:18.517
Betty, what are you doing here?

41:18.601 --> 41:21.395
Well, I saw you getting it on
with the skyline
and thought,

41:21.478 --> 41:25.149
"Hey, back off, Wayne Tower!
That's my man!"

41:25.232 --> 41:29.361
Ha! So my giant body
is not a turn-off to you?

41:29.445 --> 41:33.699
You have a sexual charisma
of which I'd like to be a part.

41:33.782 --> 41:38.913
Ending your sentence
with a noun, as opposed
to a preposition...

41:38.996 --> 41:40.206
Bane likey.

41:40.289 --> 41:43.375
[giggles]
Let's get out of here, big guy.

41:43.459 --> 41:44.835
[giggling]

41:48.005 --> 41:50.299
- Um...
- How do you think
that's gonna work?

41:50.382 --> 41:51.967
You know, not well.

41:52.051 --> 41:55.262
Wow! The smoke
from the millions
of square feet of rubble

41:55.346 --> 41:58.766
really makes for a beautiful
night sky, Ive.

41:58.849 --> 42:01.268
The next time you get the idea

42:01.352 --> 42:04.855
to do something extra Harley
to prove your love to me,

42:04.939 --> 42:07.066
I just want you to know
you don't have to.

42:07.149 --> 42:08.776
Because it doesn't matter

42:08.859 --> 42:10.945
if something's the best
Valentine's Day

42:11.028 --> 42:14.114
or date night or orgasm
I've ever had or not,

42:14.198 --> 42:18.786
because this is the best
relationship

42:18.869 --> 42:20.996
I've been in. By a mile.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.582
Yeah,
I think the orgasm matters.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.960
Yeah, I didn't totally
buy that either when I said it.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.586
I just needed, like,
a third example

42:27.670 --> 42:30.631
for the structure
of the speech, so...

42:30.714 --> 42:32.633
You know, you never just...

42:32.716 --> 42:37.137
You never just asked me
what my best
Valentine's Day ever was.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.056
I don't want to hear about
some pimple-faced kid

42:39.139 --> 42:40.975
from your boarding school
giving you a hickey.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.352
No, that's not it.

42:44.728 --> 42:46.397
It was a long, long time ago,

42:46.480 --> 42:48.691
<i>when I was alone,</i>

42:48.774 --> 42:51.485
<i>sitting in my cell in Arkham,</i>
<i>feeling like</i>

42:51.568 --> 42:55.656
[sighs]<i> no one</i>
<i>in the damn world</i>
<i>cared about me.</i>

42:55.739 --> 42:57.950
<i>Like, if I disappeared</i>
<i>from the Earth,</i>

42:58.033 --> 42:59.660
<i>it just wouldn't matter.</i>

42:59.743 --> 43:03.122
<i>And then I...</i>
<i>I hear a knock on my cell</i>

43:03.205 --> 43:05.165
<i>and I look up</i>

43:05.249 --> 43:07.835
<i>and I see your face.</i>

43:07.918 --> 43:12.089
<i>You brought me some</i>
<i>chocolate milk that you...</i>
<i>you stole from the commissary,</i>

43:12.172 --> 43:14.300
<i>and asked if I wanted</i>
<i>some company.</i>

43:14.383 --> 43:16.927
<i>And I said, "Sure."</i>

43:17.011 --> 43:20.347
And then you described
the entire plot
of<i> Shrek 2</i> to me

43:20.431 --> 43:22.349
because you couldn't
believe I hadn't seen it.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.976
It's not as good
as the first one,

43:24.059 --> 43:25.019
but it's more fun.

43:25.102 --> 43:26.353
You, Harley.

43:26.437 --> 43:30.482
You made me feel like...
like I mattered.

43:32.568 --> 43:35.863
And no one had ever
really done that for me.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.657
So I just... I don't know.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.784
I don't know if
that Valentine's Day
can be topped.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.704
- I love you, Ive.
- I love you too, peanut.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.501
The first time we met,
we tried to kill each other.

43:49.585 --> 43:52.629
No, you... you didn't
try to kill me.
I tried to kill you.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.381
But then you saved my life.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.717
Well, you were the first
person I met who
wasn't a piece of shit.

43:56.800 --> 44:00.220
- So, [laughs] I was, you know--
- I think another way
to say it, is you liked me.

44:00.304 --> 44:02.139
I did. I liked you.
[chuckles softly]

44:02.222 --> 44:05.142
And we became friends.
And then we fell in love.

44:05.225 --> 44:06.810
- And then--
- Sorry, wait.
Why are we doing this?

44:06.894 --> 44:08.562
Because everyone knows
all this shit already.

44:08.645 --> 44:10.064
So I'm just trying
to understand.

44:10.147 --> 44:11.982
I think these things
need to be a certain length.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.650
Oh, my God. How do we...

44:13.734 --> 44:15.861
How do we end
this fucking shit?

44:15.944 --> 44:17.613
I could recap<i> Shrek 3.</i>

44:17.696 --> 44:19.531
So when King Harold dies,
Shrek learns--

44:19.615 --> 44:21.742
How about we just, like,
say "Happy Valentine's Day"
to everyone

44:21.825 --> 44:22.951
and get the fuck out of here?

44:23.035 --> 44:25.162
[both] Happy Valentine's Day!

44:26.205 --> 44:27.081
[both moan]

44:28.374 --> 44:30.459
[theme music playing]
