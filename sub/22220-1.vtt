WEBVTT

00:22.440 --> 00:24.101
LAUNCH CONDITIONS AS
OF 05:30 ARE OPTIMAL.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.350
FINAL CHECKS ARE
UNDERWAY AND RECOVERY
CRAFT IN POSITION.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.101
HOW ARE THE C.R.C. NUMBERS?

00:29.238 --> 00:30.273
MID 305 AND HOLDING.

00:30.406 --> 00:31.907
METEOROLOGY'S GOT SOME HICCUP

00:32.033 --> 00:34.274
THEY'RE CHECKING OUT.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.026
SEE OUR
LATEST PRESS?

00:37.163 --> 00:40.621
"CHILDHOOD FRIENDS
OUT TO PROVE A THEORY.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.207
CAN A MANNED SPACECRAFT
OVERCOME ATMOSPHERIC FRICTION

00:43.336 --> 00:44.872
AND EXPONENTIALLY
INCREASE ITS SPEED

00:45.004 --> 00:48.212
USING ONLY A PLANET'S
NATURAL GRAVITATIONAL PULL?"

00:48.341 --> 00:49.956
HUH?

00:53.888 --> 00:56.971
MAN, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

00:58.226 --> 01:00.308
D.K., YOU KNOW
THAT FEELING YOU GET

01:00.436 --> 01:02.301
THE NIGHT BEFORE
SOMETHING BIG'S

01:02.438 --> 01:03.723
ABOUT TO HAPPEN
IN YOUR LIFE?

01:03.856 --> 01:07.314
IT'S THE NIGHT BEFORE
WE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL.

01:07.443 --> 01:09.149
IT'S THE...
NIGHT BEFORE

01:09.278 --> 01:10.654
WE STARTED THIS JOB.

01:10.780 --> 01:14.989
I HAD THAT FEELING
LAST NIGHT IN QUARANTINE.

01:15.117 --> 01:21.078
IS THIS EXPERIMENT
THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU?

01:22.833 --> 01:25.916
UH-OH. ONE
SMALL STEP, BUD.

01:26.045 --> 01:27.125
HEY, D.K.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.290
SIR.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.708
YOU'RE LOOKING
PRETTY SHARP THERE--

01:30.841 --> 01:32.627
COMMANDER CRICHTON.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.251
THANKS, DAD.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.051
LET'S DO THIS THING.

01:49.068 --> 01:53.152
I TALKED TO PETE MAXWELL AND
THE OTHERS AT CONTROL.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.114
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE REAL
GOOD CARE OF YOU WHILE
YOU'RE UP THERE.

01:57.576 --> 01:58.782
I HEARD THAT YOU, UH...

01:58.911 --> 02:02.824
YOU WENT AWOL FROM THE
RAT CAGE THIS MORNING.

02:02.957 --> 02:06.950
MAN, IN MY DAY IF I'D EVER
BROKEN QUARANTINE LIKE THAT

02:07.086 --> 02:08.121
THEY WOULD'VE...

02:08.254 --> 02:10.210
SON, YOU GOT RATTLERS
IN YOUR STOMACH?

02:10.339 --> 02:13.172
OH, I'VE BEEN UP ON THE SHUTTLE
BEFORE DAD-- TWICE.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.962
( chuckles )

02:15.094 --> 02:17.130
DIDN'T MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES I WENT UP.

02:17.263 --> 02:18.218
EVERY TIME, RATTLERS.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.635
FIRST E.V.A., FIRST TIME
I WALKED ON THE MOON...

02:21.767 --> 02:23.143
I'M NOT GOING
E.V.A., DAD.

02:23.269 --> 02:24.475
I'M NOT WALKING
ON THE MOON.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.594
I'M JUST RUNNING A
LITTLE EXPERIMENT.

02:26.731 --> 02:28.847
YEAH, AN EXPERIMENT
TO PROVE YOUR OWN THEORY.

02:28.983 --> 02:32.316
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW PROUD THAT MAKES ME?

02:32.445 --> 02:33.935
THAT'S SOMETHING
I NEVER DID.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.858
I MEAN, THE GUYS
IN THE BUTTON-DOWN COLLARS

02:36.991 --> 02:37.855
AND THE NECKTIES--

02:37.992 --> 02:39.107
THEY GOT TO USE THEIR BRAINS.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.780
THE ONLY THING I EVER
GOT TO USE WAS...

02:41.912 --> 02:42.901
"GUTS!

02:43.039 --> 02:45.246
AND THE SEAT OF MY FLIGHT SUIT."

02:45.374 --> 02:48.912
SON, I CAN'T HELP BEING
WHO I AM... WHO I WAS.

02:49.045 --> 02:51.331
IT'S NOT WHO
YOU ARE, DAD.

02:51.464 --> 02:52.704
I LOVE WHO YOU ARE.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.378
IT'S BEING SON
OF WHO YOU ARE.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.295
LOOK, |...

02:57.428 --> 02:58.508
T MINUS FOUR MINUTES...

02:58.637 --> 03:00.173
CAN'T BE YOUR
KIND OF HERO.

03:00.306 --> 03:02.843
NO, YOU CAN'T BE

03:02.975 --> 03:05.717
BUT EACH MAN GETS A CHANCE
TO BE HIS OWN KIND OF HERO.

03:05.853 --> 03:06.638
YOUR TIME WILL COME

03:06.771 --> 03:08.227
AND WHEN IT DOES,
WATCH OUT.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.972
CHANCES ARE,
IT'LL BE THE LAST THING

03:11.108 --> 03:13.645
YOU EVER EXPECTED.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.692
OH, NO.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.231
THAT'S YOUR
GOOD LUCK CHARM.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.901
YURI GAGARIN
GAVE YOU THAT.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.239
OH, LISTEN,
YOU HANG ONTO IT

03:20.368 --> 03:23.860
AND YOU GIVE IT BACK
TO ME TONIGHT, OKAY?

03:51.107 --> 03:54.224
Woman:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE PRESS

03:54.360 --> 03:56.021
AT 26:14 ON THE FLIGHT CLOCK

03:56.153 --> 03:58.644
WE BEGIN THE MAJOR EXPERIMENT
OF THIS SHUTTLE MISSION.

03:58.781 --> 04:03.115
COMMANDER JOHN CRICHTON WILL
PILOT A CRAFT OF HIS OWN DESIGN

04:03.244 --> 04:04.324
IN A DANGEROUS ATTEMPT

04:04.453 --> 04:08.321
TO USE OUR PLANET'S GRAVITY
AS A SPEED BOOSTER

04:08.457 --> 04:11.244
SLINGSHOTTING HIM OFF INTO
SPACE

04:11.377 --> 04:12.787
AT PREVIOUSLY UNRECORDED SPEEDS.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.252
IF SUCCESSFUL,
THE RESULTS ARE ANTICIPATED

04:15.381 --> 04:20.341
AS THE FIRST CONCRETE STEP
TOWARD INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL.

04:22.847 --> 04:25.463
CANAVERAL, THIS IS FARSCAPE ONE

04:25.599 --> 04:26.850
I AM FREE AND FLYING.

04:26.976 --> 04:29.137
ARE YOU WITH ME THERE,
MAMA BEAR?

04:29.270 --> 04:30.430
OH, YEAH, FARSCAPE.

04:30.563 --> 04:32.394
I'M READING YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.059
AUTHORIZING FIGHT COMPUTER

04:34.191 --> 04:37.354
TO INITIATE ACCELERATION
SEQUENCING...

04:37.486 --> 04:38.350
NOW.

04:38.487 --> 04:39.442
ROGER, FARSCAPE.

04:39.572 --> 04:42.780
YOU ARE GO
FOR INSERTION PROCEDURE.

04:44.577 --> 04:47.660
APPROACHING
MAXIMUM VELOCITY IN...

04:47.788 --> 04:50.404
21 SECONDS.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.957
18 SECONDS.

05:00.634 --> 05:05.628
ENTERING CRITICAL APOGEE PHASE.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.843
FARSCAPE ONE, HOLD A MOMENT.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.094
CANAVERAL, WHAT?

05:13.230 --> 05:15.016
METEOROLOGY REPORTS SOME KIND

05:15.149 --> 05:16.309
OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.182
REPEAT, SOME KIND OF WAVE.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.434
JOHN, DO YOU READ ME?

05:19.570 --> 05:21.401
YEAH, I READ YOU.

05:22.865 --> 05:26.028
(breaking up):
WHAT ARE WE TALKING HERE?
HOW SEVERE?

05:26.160 --> 05:27.320
CANAVERAL?

05:27.453 --> 05:28.283
(radio transmission
breaking up )

05:28.412 --> 05:29.492
JOHN, ABORT.

05:29.622 --> 05:31.362
CANAVERAL!

05:31.499 --> 05:34.286
SON, YOU HAVE TO ABORT.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.500
ABORT NOW!

06:21.757 --> 06:22.997
(grunts)

06:23.133 --> 06:26.421
OH, GOD, I CAN'T...

06:27.846 --> 06:31.464
CANAVERAL, THIS IS FARSCAPE ONE.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.092
I'M OKAY. REPEAT, I'M OKAY.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.844
WH... H00, H00!

06:36.981 --> 06:39.142
HEY, DID YOU GUYS GET VIDEO
THROUGH ALL THAT?

06:39.275 --> 06:41.436
CANAVERAL?

06:42.778 --> 06:44.279
D.K.?

06:44.405 --> 06:45.690
DAD?

06:45.823 --> 06:48.781
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS? WHERE'S...

06:52.413 --> 06:54.529
EARTH?

06:57.960 --> 07:00.042
WHAT THE H...?

07:02.214 --> 07:04.796
UH...

07:04.925 --> 07:06.631
CANAVERAL?

08:08.530 --> 08:11.317
CANAVERAL, I'VE BEEN HIT!

08:30.386 --> 08:33.253
THAT'S BIG.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.425
THAT'S REALLY BIG.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.396
OH, HELL.

08:45.526 --> 08:51.442
CANAVERAL, DAD, D.K.,
I'M BEING PULLED.

08:51.573 --> 08:55.282
THE ENGINE'S NOT RESPONDING
AND I CAN'T BREAK AWAY.

08:55.411 --> 08:56.571
CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?

08:56.704 --> 08:58.490
CANAVERAL?

09:04.420 --> 09:06.627
OH, MY GOD.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.871
UM...

09:28.610 --> 09:31.226
(hydraulic whirring)

09:36.577 --> 09:40.195
(hydraulic whirring)

09:46.962 --> 09:49.704
( buzzing )

09:56.638 --> 10:00.096
(alarm beeping )

10:02.186 --> 10:07.431
(extinguisher hissing)

10:12.321 --> 10:15.154
(coughing)

10:25.667 --> 10:30.536
(deep rumbling, whirring
and squeaking sounds)

10:33.425 --> 10:36.838
( creature buzzing
and whirring)

10:52.444 --> 10:58.235
(speaking alien language
of beeps and whirs)

11:08.335 --> 11:11.827
(speaking alien language)

11:21.849 --> 11:25.683
(speaking different
alien language)

11:57.301 --> 11:59.792
UM...

12:04.141 --> 12:05.096
MY NAME'S JOHN.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.886
JOHN...

12:07.019 --> 12:08.930
(speaking alien language)

12:09.062 --> 12:12.304
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT...

12:12.983 --> 12:14.439
(gasps )

12:18.697 --> 12:20.233
WHAT WAS...?

12:20.365 --> 12:23.232
I SUGGEST YOU ANSWER
HIM QUICKLY. YOU KNOW

12:23.368 --> 12:24.278
HOW LUXANS CAN BE.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.696
YOUR SHIP...

12:25.829 --> 12:27.365
WHAT KIND IS IT?

12:27.497 --> 12:29.237
YOUR SHIP APPEARED
FROM NOWHERE

12:29.374 --> 12:30.955
AND WE DON'T KNOW

12:31.084 --> 12:32.164
THAT TECHNOLOGY.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.830
IS IT SOMETHING
WE CAN USE TO ESCAPE?

12:33.962 --> 12:36.078
WE BROUGHT YOU ABOARD
FOR ONE REASON.

12:36.214 --> 12:41.334
TELL US OR DIE WITH US.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.673
(grunts)

12:47.809 --> 12:50.892
PILOT, I DEMAND YOU GIVE ME
MANEUVERABILITY NOW!

12:53.231 --> 12:55.688
PILOT!

12:55.817 --> 12:57.023
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

12:57.152 --> 13:00.770
NOT WHILE THE CONTROL COLLAR'S
STILL IN PLACE.

13:00.906 --> 13:05.525
MOYA CAN'T WITHSTAND THIS
ASSAULT MUCH LONGER.

13:07.329 --> 13:10.321
THOSE SYNAPSES
YOU'RE TEARING OUT ARE

13:10.457 --> 13:11.412
NOT WIRED TO THE CONTROL COLLAR.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.328
THEN I SHALL KEEP
PULLING UNTIL I FIND

13:14.461 --> 13:16.292
THE ONES THAT ARE!

13:17.756 --> 13:19.917
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

13:21.677 --> 13:24.589
Zhann:
THE OTHERS--
WHERE ARE THEY?

13:24.721 --> 13:26.882
THERE ARE NO OTHERS.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.052
I'VE CHECKED
EVERY CELL LEVEL.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.095
I FOUND A MANIFEST.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.719
WE WERE SCHEDULED FOR TRANSFER
TO TERRAN RAA.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.141
THAT IS A LIFERS' COLONY.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.310
PRISONERS?

13:38.443 --> 13:39.603
YOU'RE ESCAPED PRISONERS?

13:39.736 --> 13:43.524
I WILL NOT BE TAKEN
PRISONER AGAIN.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.568
THEY BROUGHT YOU ON BOARD,
DIDN'T THEY?

13:45.701 --> 13:47.282
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL PROTECT YOU.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.992
I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU NOW.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.986
YOU LOOK AFTER ME LATER.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.330
( explosion )

13:53.458 --> 13:56.200
(rapid beeping )

13:56.336 --> 14:00.204
ATTENTION: HULL INTEGRITY IS
REACHING CRITICAL COMPROMISE.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.832
(chanting prayer)

14:12.394 --> 14:13.975
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

14:14.104 --> 14:16.140
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
-THE CODING WALL--

14:16.273 --> 14:17.638
IT'S DIMMING.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.188
I'VE HIT THE CODE.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.312
I'VE HIT THE CODE.

14:25.449 --> 14:26.438
THE CONTROL COLLAR--

14:26.575 --> 14:28.861
IT'S COMING OFF.

14:44.176 --> 14:46.383
PILOT, PREPARE
FOR IMMEDIATE STARBURST.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.797
MOYA HAS BEEN RESTRAINED
SO LONG...

14:48.930 --> 14:51.672
SHE IS A LEVIATHAN. IT IS
THE SINGLE DEFENSIVE MANEUVER

14:51.808 --> 14:53.264
THAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.971
Man:
TERMINATE ASSAULT.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.475
ALL PROWLERS TERMINATE ASSAULT.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.817
CLAW ONTO SOMETHING, PEOPLE.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.440
PREPARE
FOR STARBURST.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.591
I HATE STARBURST.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.082
Woman:
CAPTAIN.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.075
CAPTAIN CRAIS?

16:02.212 --> 16:03.292
YES, LIEUTENANT.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.707
THE PROWLER SQUAD
HAS RETURNED, SIR.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.924
THEY REPORT THE LEVIATHAN
TRANSPORT HAS ESCAPED.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.213
ONE OF THE PRISONERS,
THE HYNERIAN ROYAL

16:11.346 --> 16:16.010
SOMEHOW SECURED THE KEY CODES
TO THE PRISONERS' CELLS AND...

16:16.143 --> 16:18.680
THERE WERE CASUALTIES, SIR.
TWO SHIPS LOST AND...

16:18.812 --> 16:21.224
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT CASUALTIES.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.971
A LEVIATHAN
TRANSPORTING PRISONERS

16:23.108 --> 16:25.064
DOES NOT ESCAPE
WHILE IN MY CUSTODY.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.273
HAS MY BROTHER RETURNED YET?

16:26.403 --> 16:27.939
I WILL DISPATCH HIM
IN THE REAR

16:28.071 --> 16:29.732
BATTLE FIGHTER
TO TRACK HER DOWN.

16:29.865 --> 16:32.652
SIR, THIS IS PLAYBACK
FROM THE RECON SATELLITE

16:32.784 --> 16:36.276
MONITORING THE PURSUIT
OF THE LEVIATHAN.

16:37.956 --> 16:41.198
WHAT MANNER OF CRAFT IS THAT?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.825
MY BROTHER'S PROWLER.

16:43.962 --> 16:47.750
I'M SURE THAT HE...

16:55.974 --> 16:58.181
WE LOST A SECOND SHIP, SIR.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.141
IT WAS ABSORBED
INTO THE LEVIATHAN

17:00.270 --> 17:02.181
WHEN IT WENT
INTO STARBURST.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.394
I WANT TO SEE HIM.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.148
SEE HIM, SIR?

17:04.274 --> 17:06.265
PEEL BACK THE IMAGE.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.643
I WANT TO SEE WHO IS INSIDE.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.871
WE'VE DONE IT! WE'VE ESCAPED!

17:25.003 --> 17:27.210
ATTENTION:
ONE PROWLER TRAVELED WITH US.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.206
BLOCK ITS RADIO, NET IT
AND BRING IT ABOARD.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.674
AS GOOD AS DONE.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.761
PILOT, DOES MOYA KNOW
WHERE WE ARE?

17:36.890 --> 17:37.504
YES, OF COURSE.

17:37.641 --> 17:40.348
WE'RE SOMEPLACE ELSE.

17:40.477 --> 17:43.844
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
ON THE SPECIFICS.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.183
AT LEAST WE ARE FREE.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.431
(snons)

17:47.567 --> 17:49.182
( spits )

17:51.279 --> 17:56.615
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU PEOPLE?!

18:10.757 --> 18:15.797
THIS DAMNED LEVIATHAN
HAS NO IDEA WHERE WE ARE.

18:24.396 --> 18:27.183
I AM PA'U ZOTAH ZHAAN.
AND YOU?

18:27.315 --> 18:30.148
KA D'ARGO.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.774
YOU ARE DELVIAN.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.567
A PRIEST.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.819
I'VE HEARD
OF YOUR KIND'S PRACTICES.

18:43.123 --> 18:46.240
YOUR APPETITES.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.205
SUCH AS?

18:49.337 --> 18:53.000
I'VE HEARD OF SOMETHING
KNOWN AS...

18:53.133 --> 18:57.877
THE, UH, FOURTH SENSATION.

18:58.013 --> 19:01.847
I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.311
NOT LATELY.

19:07.188 --> 19:12.399
OH. WHY, WHY WERE YOU, UH

19:12.527 --> 19:14.768
WHY HAVE YOU, UH...?

19:14.904 --> 19:16.644
IMPRISONED?

19:16.781 --> 19:20.319
BECAUSE ON MY HOME WORLD,
EVEN AMONG MY KIND

19:20.452 --> 19:23.535
I WAS SOMETHING
OF AN ANARCHIST.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.120
ACTUALLY,

19:26.249 --> 19:29.741
I WAS THE LEADING ANARCHIST.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.288
AND YOU?

19:33.214 --> 19:35.546
I KILLED A FELLOW SOLDIER.

19:37.010 --> 19:41.253
MY COMMANDING OFFICER.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.350
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.893
30 CYCLES.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.687
YOU ARE BUT A BOY.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.150
I AM NOT.

19:56.279 --> 19:59.146
I AM A LUXAN WARRIOR.

19:59.282 --> 20:04.822
I HAVE SEEN
TWO BATTLE CAMPAIGNS.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.196
ONLY TWO?

20:11.836 --> 20:14.293
YOU KNOW PEACEKEEPER CODING?

20:14.422 --> 20:17.755
YES. I SPENT THREE CYCLES ON
A MAXIMUM LABOUR PLANET.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.090
WHICH ONE?

20:19.219 --> 20:20.425
MEKKAR 7.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.045
ASSIGNED TO PEACEKEEPER
INTELLILAN INTERFACE.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.218
I WAS ON MEKKAR 7.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.636
TRULY?

20:27.769 --> 20:32.103
IN THE NINETY THIRD LEVEL.
IN THE KEMLAC MINES.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.438
WHY AREN T YOU DEAD?

20:33.566 --> 20:36.182
I OFTEN ASK MYSELF THE
SAME QUESTION.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.356
I WATCHED SO MANY OTHERS DIE
WHILE THE PEACEKEEPERS
LOOKED ON.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.232
SOMEHOW IT MADE ME STRONGER.

20:43.368 --> 20:47.987
I SUPPOSE THE WARRIOR IN ME
BECAME TOO STRONG
NOT TO SURVIVE.

20:48.123 --> 20:51.411
PERHAPS YOU SURVIVED FOR THIS.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.200
THIS ESCAPE?

20:54.337 --> 20:56.498
I DOUBT IT WILL LAST LONG ENOUGH
FOR THE PEACEKEEPERS

20:56.631 --> 20:58.212
EVEN TO NOTE IT IN THEIR LOG.

20:58.341 --> 21:01.799
NOT THE ESCAPE ITSELF, BUT WHAT
WE PRAY WILL BE THE RESULT.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.340
FREEDOM.

21:04.472 --> 21:08.966
THAT IS A VERY DELVIAN WAY
TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION.

21:09.102 --> 21:12.139
I AM NOTHING IF NOT A
PRODUCT OF MY UPBRINGING.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.558
AND I OF MINE.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.023
THEN PERHAPS TOGETHER A
WARRIOR AND A PRIEST

21:17.152 --> 21:19.438
CAN HELP SAVE EACH OTHER.

21:27.412 --> 21:31.121
OH, PLEASE,
LET IT ALL BE A DREAM...

21:31.249 --> 21:37.290
A VERY BAD AND
VERY TWISTED DREAM.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.959
(squeaking sound)

21:49.767 --> 21:52.383
(grunts)

21:57.317 --> 21:58.773
WHAT, UM...

21:58.902 --> 22:00.312
WHERE...?

22:00.445 --> 22:03.983
( beeping )

22:04.115 --> 22:06.276
WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES?

22:12.248 --> 22:13.283
HEY!

22:13.416 --> 22:15.532
WHY DID YOU TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES?

22:15.668 --> 22:16.874
I AM RYGEL THE 16th

22:17.003 --> 22:19.915
DOMINAR TO OVER
600 BILLION PEOPLE.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.164
I DON'T NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.086
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A PRISONER.

22:24.219 --> 22:25.755
FALSELY IMPRISONED.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.172
MY COUSIN, BISHAN

22:27.305 --> 22:30.138
STOLE MY THRONE FROM ME
WHILE I SLEPT.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.053
A MISTAKE I WILL
SOON BE CORRECTING.

22:33.186 --> 22:38.055
YOUR GARMENTS WERE REMOVED
SO THAT WE COULD EXAMINE YOU.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.180
"EXAMINE"?

22:39.317 --> 22:40.477
EXAMINE ME?

22:40.610 --> 22:42.146
HOW? WHERE?
WAIT A MINUTE.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.065
ONE OF THOSE MECHANICAL THINGS
OF YOURS INJECTED ME

22:45.198 --> 22:47.530
RIGHT HERE.
TRANSLATOR MICROBES.

22:47.659 --> 22:48.774
"MICROBES"?

22:48.910 --> 22:49.740
THEY COLON IZE

22:49.869 --> 22:50.904
AT THE BASE OF THE BRAIN.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.198
ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.992
WHY YOU WEREN'T INJECTED
AT BIRTH

22:55.124 --> 22:56.910
I CANNOT FATHOM.

22:57.043 --> 23:03.209
"COLONIZE... "BRAIN"...

23:03.341 --> 23:05.627
WHY HAVE YOU GOT ME
LOCKED IN HERE?

23:05.760 --> 23:08.092
I'M NOT HERE TO HARM YOU.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.212
HELL, I WOULDN'T
KNOW HOW TO HARM YOU.

23:10.348 --> 23:14.557
WE CAN NO MORE TRUST YOU
THAN WE CAN TRUST THAT.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.003
HI...

23:48.136 --> 23:49.797
MY NAME'S JOHN.

23:56.561 --> 23:58.677
(grunts)

24:00.857 --> 24:02.518
WHAT IS YOUR RANK AND REGIMENT?

24:02.650 --> 24:05.062
AND WHY ARE YOU OUT
OF UNIFORM?

24:05.194 --> 24:07.480
RANK AND REGIMENT NOW.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.455
LET ME OUT OF HERE,
YOU HYNERIAN SLUG.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.324
YOUR EFFORTS ARE WASTED,
PEACEKEEPER.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.998
YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
SHOULD KNOW THAT.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.212
PEACEKEEPER?

24:26.341 --> 24:28.002
YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE OUT THERE
ATTACKING THE SHIP.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.670
THEY THINK I'M ONE OF YOU?

24:29.802 --> 24:30.632
OFFICER AERYN SUN.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.127
SPECIAL PEACEKEEPER COMMANDO.

24:32.263 --> 24:36.051
ICARION COMPANY,
PLEISAR REGIMENT.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.220
IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

24:38.353 --> 24:41.265
MY RANK IS COMMANDER.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.308
I'M NOT MILITARY.

24:43.441 --> 24:45.727
AT LEAST NOT
ANY MILITARY YOU KNOW.

24:45.860 --> 24:49.102
I'M A DAMN SCIENTIST.

24:54.035 --> 24:54.694
MMM?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.237
(grunts)

24:56.371 --> 24:58.987
MMM.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.208
HMM.

25:08.341 --> 25:11.299
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

25:12.220 --> 25:15.712
OUR POSSESSIONS-- MY BLADE.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.225
Rygel:
HANDS OFF, LUXAN.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.091
AH, YOU'RE AWAKE,
BOTH OF YOU.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.219
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, MY DEAR?

25:22.355 --> 25:24.812
YOU SHOULD BE USED TO VIEWING
THE LIKES OF US THROUGH BARS.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.272
YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.357
I'M NOT WHAT YOU THINK I AM.

25:28.486 --> 25:30.647
NOT A PEACEKEEPER?
YES, WE KNOW THAT NOW.

25:30.780 --> 25:33.692
YOU HAVE SOME DECIDEDLY
UNFAMILIAR BACTERIA
LIVING WITHIN YOU.

25:33.825 --> 25:36.282
I'M FROM A PLANET
CALLED EARTH.

25:36.411 --> 25:37.821
I'M HUMAN.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.285
HOMO SAPIENS SAPIEN.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.325
IT'S TIME FOR US TO EAT.

25:45.128 --> 25:47.210
EAT WHAT?

25:53.219 --> 25:56.962
Crais:
WHOEVER KILLED MY BROTHER
WILL PAY DEARLY.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.348
CAPTAIN...

26:01.477 --> 26:05.311
THE TECHS ARE COMPLETING THE
IMAGING OF THE MODULE'S PILOT.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.431
SHOW ME.

26:12.572 --> 26:15.234
ON THE FINAL SWEEP NOW, SIR.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.992
HE'S SEBACEAN.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.201
INFORM THE REAR BATTLE FIGHTER.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.914
THEY WILL TAKE CHARGE
OF THE ARMADA.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.329
WE ARE GOING AFTER
THE LEVIATHAN.

26:28.463 --> 26:29.418
BUT SIR, REGULATIONS...

26:29.547 --> 26:32.664
THAT IS A DIRECT ORDER
LIEUTENANT.

26:42.935 --> 26:43.720
I'M NOT A PEACEKEEPER.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.263
CAN YOU GET THIS
OFF MY WRISTS?

26:45.396 --> 26:46.932
WE DO NOT KNOW
YOUR LOYALTIES.

26:47.064 --> 26:49.020
MY LOYALTIES...
I JUST GOT HERE.

26:49.150 --> 26:54.190
YOU'RE THE FIRST ALIEN CONTACT
ANYBODY FROM MY PLANET
HAS EVER MADE.

26:54.322 --> 26:56.062
WE DREAMED ABOUT IT,
MADE MOVIES ABOUT IT...

26:56.199 --> 26:58.565
BY THE WAY, WHAT PART
OF THE UNIVERSE ARE WE IN?

26:58.701 --> 27:00.441
ARE WE STILL IN ORION'S ARM?

27:00.578 --> 27:02.034
STILL IN THE MILKY WAY?

27:02.163 --> 27:04.950
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT, DO YOU?

27:05.082 --> 27:06.538
I NEED TO SEE SOME
STAR CHARTS.

27:06.667 --> 27:09.374
GET SOME COMMON POINTS
OF REFERENCE... DAMN!

27:09.504 --> 27:11.165
THIS SHIP IS AMAZING.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.332
WHAT KIND OF...?

27:12.465 --> 27:13.830
SHE'S A LEVIATHAN.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.548
A BIO-MECHANOID.
A LIVING SHIP.

27:18.179 --> 27:21.046
(growling)

27:22.350 --> 27:23.465
D'Argo:
YOU BLAME ME?

27:23.601 --> 27:25.091
IF I HADN'T PULLED THOSE WIRES

27:25.228 --> 27:28.220
YOUR PRECIOUS MOYA WOULD STILL
BE WEARING THAT CONTROL COLLAR.

27:28.356 --> 27:29.345
PILOT:
BUT IN DOING SO

27:29.482 --> 27:31.598
YOU ALSO CAUSED MOYA
TO HEMORRHAGE

27:31.734 --> 27:33.725
MOST OF HER IRISCENTANT FLUID.

27:33.861 --> 27:35.601
LEADING TO
WHAT RESULT, PILOT?

27:35.738 --> 27:38.104
LEADING TO OUR CURRENT
MAXIMUM SPEED

27:38.241 --> 27:39.981
WHICH IS BARELY HETCH TWO.

27:40.117 --> 27:43.029
MOYA AND I DON'T
WANT TO RETURN...

27:43.162 --> 27:45.118
CRICHTON:
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?

27:45.248 --> 27:46.909
FEEDING US.

27:47.041 --> 27:49.578
THEY'LL NEED INFORMATION
IF THEY'RE GOING TO SURVIVE.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.541
THEY'RE HOPING
WE'LL PROVIDE IT.

27:51.671 --> 27:54.583
(slurping)

27:56.092 --> 27:57.707
I'D EAT

27:57.844 --> 28:00.176
IF I WERE YOU.

28:00.304 --> 28:03.546
IT MAY BE THE
ONLY CHANCE...

28:03.683 --> 28:05.298
WE GET.

28:05.434 --> 28:06.093
WE?

28:06.227 --> 28:08.309
THE SHIP'S PILOT
JUST INFORMED US

28:08.437 --> 28:10.769
THAT WE ARE APPROACHING
AN INHABITED SYSTEM

28:10.898 --> 28:12.229
WITH A COMMERCE PLANET.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.894
RYGEL:
A COMMERCE PLANET!

28:14.026 --> 28:16.563
EXCELLENT.
WE NEED MANY THINGS.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.108
HYNERIAN CREAM SOAP,
DEFINITELY.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.105
SOME FRESH JANERAY SYRUP
TO GET RID OF THE TASTE

28:21.242 --> 28:24.359
OF THESE FOOD CUBES...
-WE NEED IRISCENTANT FLUID.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.611
HOW DARE YOU, YOU LUXAN SLIME!

28:26.747 --> 28:28.078
SILENCE, YOUR EMINENCE.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.663
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING
FOR A REASON

28:29.792 --> 28:31.157
NOT TO JETTISON YOU WITH
THE REFUSE DUMP.

28:31.294 --> 28:33.125
YOU'D DUMP ME?!

28:33.254 --> 28:35.620
I BRIBED THE MAINTENANCE DRONES
AT THE LAST CHECKPOINT!

28:35.756 --> 28:38.884
I SECURED THE CELL CODES...
-GENTLEMEN...

28:39.010 --> 28:44.130
GENTLEMEN, I SUGGEST WE FOCUS
ON THE SITUATION AT HAND.

28:48.561 --> 28:51.428
BEFORE WE APPROACH
THIS PLANET, WE MUST KNOW...

28:51.564 --> 28:55.307
IS THERE PEACEKEEPER
PRESENCE IN THIS SYSTEM?

29:00.281 --> 29:02.112
I DON'T KNOW.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.276
WISH I DID.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.025
WE ARE WASTING TIME
WE DO NOT HAVE.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.072
SHE IS INFANTRY.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.114
PEACEKEEPER COMMAND
TELLS HER WHERE

29:08.247 --> 29:11.080
TO FIGHT AND DIE.
( passing gas)

29:11.208 --> 29:13.199
THIS ONE... IS SOME KIND OF

29:13.336 --> 29:15.327
(high voice):
HIGHER BRAIN FUNCTION DEFICIENT.

29:15.463 --> 29:18.296
HOW HE ESCAPED THE GENETIC
SIEVING PROCESS

29:18.424 --> 29:19.539
I DO NOT KNOW.

29:19.675 --> 29:20.790
( Rygel passing gas)

29:20.927 --> 29:22.337
Zhaan (high voice):
RYGEL?

29:22.470 --> 29:24.085
(high voice):
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

29:24.221 --> 29:27.884
(high voice):
IT'S A NATURAL BODILY FUNCTION.
AND IT'S ODORLESS.

29:28.017 --> 29:30.383
SO YOUR LOYAL SUBJECTS TELL YOU.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.931
YOU FART HELIUM?

29:33.064 --> 29:33.894
SOMETIMES.

29:34.023 --> 29:35.979
WHEN I'M NERVOUS... OR ANGRY.

29:36.108 --> 29:39.066
Pilot:
ATTENTION-- I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD WANT TO KNOW

29:39.195 --> 29:41.311
WE ARE ENTERING PLANETARY ORBIT.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.233
THANK YOU, PILOT.

29:44.784 --> 29:46.240
Crichton (high voice):
HEY!

29:48.037 --> 29:50.323
( fork clatters )

30:02.259 --> 30:04.545
Rygel:
YOU KNOW, YOU ONLY EXPOSE
YOUR IGNORANCE

30:04.679 --> 30:08.092
IF YOU DON'T CONCEDE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE HURLIAN STONE.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.180
(hissing)

30:12.228 --> 30:13.638
20.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.477
20 BARRELS OF FLUID!

30:15.606 --> 30:17.107
THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN YOU'D HAVE BEEN

30:17.233 --> 30:19.144
DISEMBOWELED WITH
A DULL LASHLAN SPADE

30:19.276 --> 30:21.062
FOR HALF SUCH
AN INSULT TO ME.

30:21.195 --> 30:24.187
(hissing angrily)

30:24.323 --> 30:26.484
35?

30:26.617 --> 30:30.451
BOY, WAS SPIELBERG EVER WRONG.

30:31.288 --> 30:34.576
CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, MY ASS.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.250
(grunting)

30:42.383 --> 30:45.375
WORMHOLE...

30:45.511 --> 30:47.376
I MUST HAVE COME IN THROUGH A...

30:47.513 --> 30:51.051
I MUST HAVE COME IN
THROUGH AWORMHOLE.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.298
YEAH.

30:52.435 --> 30:54.266
SO IF I DID COME HERE
THROUGH AWORMHOLE

30:54.395 --> 30:57.683
THE ONLY WAY THAT I'M GOING
TO GET BACK IS TO...

30:57.815 --> 30:59.680
FIND ANOTHER WORMHOLE.

30:59.817 --> 31:02.433
OR TO CREATE ONE.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.777
YEAH. RIGHT.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.111
LOOK...

31:06.240 --> 31:09.152
YOU WANT TO MAKE ONE OF THESE
WORMHOLE THINGS OF YOURS?

31:09.285 --> 31:14.154
HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO DO THAT
FROM INSIDE THIS CELL?

31:14.290 --> 31:16.372
(Aeryn grunting )

31:16.500 --> 31:19.492
( whistles )

31:25.843 --> 31:26.878
COME ON, MOVE FASTER.

31:27.011 --> 31:27.796
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:27.928 --> 31:29.179
I'M GOING TO SABOTAGE THIS SHIP.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.261
SABOTAGE? GIVE ME A BREAK.
THEY HAVEN'T HURT US.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.676
HOW ABOUT WE SHOW 'EM A
LITTLE COMPASSION?

31:36.103 --> 31:37.343
COMPASSION? WHAT IS COMPASSION?

31:37.480 --> 31:39.892
COMPASSION? WHAT, YOU'RE
KIDDING, RIGHT?

31:40.024 --> 31:42.140
IT S A FEELING THAT YOU
HAVE WHEN YOU SEE

31:42.276 --> 31:44.016
SOMEONE ELSE S PAIN AND
INSTEAD OF TAKING ADVANTAGE

31:44.153 --> 31:45.142
OF THEIR WEAKNESS YOU HELP THEM.

31:45.279 --> 31:46.268
OH, I KNOW THIS FEELING.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.612
YEAH, WELL, IT IS A FAIRLY
COMMON HUMAN FEELING.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.572
MMM. I HATE IT.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.116
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M ON
THE WRONG TEAM HERE.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.234
I'M JUST GOING TO STAY.

31:54.371 --> 31:55.497
FINE. DO WHAT YOU WANT.

31:55.623 --> 31:57.284
BUT IF YOU STAY WITH THESE
LOWLIFES, YOU'LL DIE WITH THEM.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.077
YEAH, WELL, HOW DO I KNOW
I CAN TRUST YOU?

31:59.210 --> 32:02.498
YOU DON'T. THAT'S JUST ANOTHER
THING YOU DON T KNOW.

32:04.632 --> 32:06.213
DAMN!

32:07.718 --> 32:08.673
WHAT IS THAT?

32:08.803 --> 32:10.794
THAT'S CUTTING EDGE
TECHNOLOGY.

32:10.930 --> 32:13.216
WE'RE TAKING MINE.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.735
Teeg:
CAPTAIN!

32:28.864 --> 32:31.241
WE ARE RECEIVING A TRANSMISSION
FROM ONE OF THE OUTER SYSTEMS.

32:31.367 --> 32:34.279
IT'S AERYN SUN, THE PROWLER
PILOT WE THOUGHT WE'D LOST.

32:34.411 --> 32:39.451
SHE WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE ABOARD THE
LEVIATHAN, BUT SHE'S ESCAPED.

32:45.005 --> 32:49.419
(ALIEN LANGUAGES BEING SPOKEN)

33:10.823 --> 33:12.734
I'M ON ANOTHER PLANET.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.903
YES, PILOT. UNDERSTOOD.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.822
THE FEMALE PEACEKEEPER AND
THE HUMAN HAVE JUST ESCAPED

33:17.955 --> 33:19.320
AND THERE'S A FULL
COMMAND CARRIER

33:19.456 --> 33:21.196
ON APPROACH TO THIS PLANET.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.709
A FULL CARRIER? CRAIS...

33:22.835 --> 33:26.202
BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR HIM
TO COME AFTER US HIMSELF.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.953
UNLESS THE TWO
WHO JUST ESCAPED

33:28.090 --> 33:29.330
ARE SOMETHING
VERY SPECIAL.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.923
THIS BARTER
SESSION IS OVER.

33:33.804 --> 33:36.045
TROUBLE. WE MUST GO.

33:36.182 --> 33:37.171
HMM... WHAT ARE
YOU ASKING

33:37.308 --> 33:39.424
FOR THOSE WELLAN
GLOW CRYSTALS...

33:39.560 --> 33:40.219
WHOA!

33:40.352 --> 33:43.435
(hissing angrily)

33:51.530 --> 33:52.565
COME ON.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.438
I'VE RELAYED OUR
RENDEZVOUS POINT.

33:54.575 --> 33:57.282
WE CAN GET OFF THIS
WASTE HOLE OF A PLANET.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.113
THAT'S THE LEVIATHAN'S POD.

34:02.249 --> 34:03.580
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.950
COME ON, WE HAVE
TO REPORT IT.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.244
AREN'T WE ABOUT
TO BE RESCUED?

34:09.381 --> 34:11.542
THEY ARE NO DANGER
TO US, RIGHT?

34:11.675 --> 34:12.790
THEY'RE PRISONERS.

34:12.927 --> 34:13.916
ESCAPED PRISONERS.

34:14.053 --> 34:15.509
THEY MUST BE RECAPTURED.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.674
OR DESTROYED.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.099
DO NOT TEMPT ME.

34:23.229 --> 34:24.594
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.311
THERE'S A SHIPFUL OF
PEACEKEEPERS ON ITS WAY
HERE RIGHT NOW.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.270
TRAITOR.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.230
THAT IS WHY I WANT YOU BOTH
ABOARD MOYA

34:29.360 --> 34:30.315
AS INSURANCE.

34:30.444 --> 34:33.402
Crichton:
JUST GO BEFORE...

34:37.201 --> 34:38.657
YOU ARE SUCH FOOLS.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.072
I WILL NOT FALL FOR SUCH
AN ANCIENT RUSE.

34:41.205 --> 34:43.116
BUT FALL YOU WILL, LUXAN.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.911
IF THE LUXAN
GIVES YOU ANY TROUBLE

34:46.043 --> 34:47.908
KILL HIM.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.966
CAPTAIN CRAIS.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.973
NAME?

35:08.857 --> 35:11.439
IT'S, UH, JOHN CRICHTON.

35:11.568 --> 35:15.277
AND WHERE ARE YOU FROM...

35:15.406 --> 35:17.988
JOHN CRICHTON?

35:18.117 --> 35:19.232
SIR, HE CLAIMS

35:19.368 --> 35:22.075
TO BE A HUMAN FROM A
PLANET CALLED ERP.

35:22.204 --> 35:23.819
BUT HE'S SHOWN HIMSELF...

35:23.956 --> 35:25.492
Crais:
TO BE WHAT?
A CLEVER IMPOSTOR.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.081
AN ACCOMPLICE TO A SHIP
FULL OF ESCAPING PRISONERS.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.371
MY BROTHER'S MURDERER.

35:30.504 --> 35:31.835
YOUR BROTHER'S WHAT?

35:31.964 --> 35:33.795
YOU CHARGED
MY BROTHER'S PROWLER

35:33.924 --> 35:36.006
IN THAT WHITE DEATH POD
OF YOURS.

35:36.135 --> 35:38.296
YOU TALKING ABOUT
THAT NEAR MISS I HAD

35:38.429 --> 35:40.169
THE FIRST MINUTE I GOT HERE?

35:40.306 --> 35:41.261
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

35:41.390 --> 35:44.223
THAT WAS NO NEAR MISS
FOR MY BROTHER.

35:47.438 --> 35:49.053
A HUMAN?

35:49.189 --> 35:51.396
THAT WILL REQUIRE SOME STUDY.

35:51.525 --> 35:55.438
I WILL PERSONALLY
ENJOY PULLING YOU APART

35:55.571 --> 35:59.063
TO SEE WHAT
YOU'RE MADE OF.

36:00.784 --> 36:01.773
Crichton:
HEY!

36:01.910 --> 36:02.740
Aeryn:
WAIT.

36:02.870 --> 36:04.110
Crais:
YES, OFFICER SUN?

36:04.246 --> 36:05.782
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS ALIEN?

36:05.914 --> 36:08.200
Aeryn:
ONLY THAT I HAVE SPENT
TIME WITH HIM, SIR

36:08.334 --> 36:12.077
AND I BELIEVE THAT
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
BROTHER WAS AN ACCIDENT.

36:12.212 --> 36:14.294
I DON'T BELIEVE HE
IS BRAVE ENOUGH

36:14.423 --> 36:15.503
OR INTELLIGENT ENOUGH

36:15.632 --> 36:19.090
TO ATTACK ONE OF OUR
PROWLERS INTENTIONALLY.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.550
EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME

36:20.679 --> 36:23.512
HAVE YOU SPENT
WITH THIS HUMAN?

36:26.643 --> 36:29.259
Crichton:
NOT A LOT.

36:29.396 --> 36:32.012
NOT MUCH AT ALL.

36:32.149 --> 36:33.935
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW

36:34.068 --> 36:36.104
PEACEKEEPER HIGH COMMAND
HAS VERY CLEAR PARAMETERS

36:36.236 --> 36:38.898
REGARDING CONTACT WITH
UNCLASSIFIED ALIEN LIFE-FORMS.

36:39.031 --> 36:42.364
YOU MAY HAVE VERY WELL EXCEEDED
THOSE PARAMETERS, OFFICER SUN.

36:42.493 --> 36:44.779
WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU
IRREVERSIBLY CONTAMINATED.

36:44.912 --> 36:46.118
Aeryn:
NO, SIR...

36:46.246 --> 36:47.577
TAKE THEM ALL AWAY.

36:47.706 --> 36:51.745
PREPARE THEM FOR TRANSIT WHILE
WE LOCATE THE PRISONERS.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.742
WARRIOR TO WARRIOR

36:53.879 --> 36:55.210
I VOW ONE DAY

36:55.339 --> 36:56.294
I WILL KILL YOU.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.880
Man:
KEEP MOVING. COME ON.

37:12.356 --> 37:13.766
PILOT, HOW'S IT COMING?

37:13.899 --> 37:15.639
FLUID TANKS ARE NEARLY FULL.

37:15.776 --> 37:17.391
SHOULD BE ANOTHER MINUTE OR TWO.

37:17.528 --> 37:19.109
ANY WORD FROM D'ARGO?

37:19.238 --> 37:21.820
NONE. I'M SORRY.

37:23.826 --> 37:26.033
MM.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.737
RIGHT. TURN AROUND.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.537
Man:
OVER THERE. STAND STILL.

37:34.670 --> 37:36.251
WHAT IS THIS THING?

37:36.380 --> 37:38.211
Crichton:
IT'S A TOY. A PUZZLE.

37:38.340 --> 37:40.046
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW
TO TAKE IT APART AND

37:40.175 --> 37:41.255
PUT IT BACK TOGETHER.

37:41.385 --> 37:43.296
A FIELD RESOURCEFULNESS
EXERCISE?

37:43.429 --> 37:47.388
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

37:47.516 --> 37:49.598
HERE. YOU PULL THAT LOOP
THROUGH THERE.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.978
YEAH, THAT ONE.

37:52.646 --> 37:53.806
GOOD.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.056
NOW FIGURE HOW TO PUT IT
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

37:58.986 --> 38:00.271
IT'S A WEAPON, YOU FOOL.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.816
GIVE IT HERE BEFORE
YOU ACTIVATE IT.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.233
DON'T DO THAT.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.277
HEY! HEY, YOU!

38:06.410 --> 38:08.196
FREEZE!

38:16.128 --> 38:17.117
DON'T MOVE

38:17.254 --> 38:19.119
OR I'LL FILL YOU FULL OF...

38:19.256 --> 38:22.339
LITTLE YELLOW
BOLTS OF LIGHT.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.090
THROW ME THE KEY.

38:29.308 --> 38:30.798
NOW, ON THE GROUND.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.265
GIVE UP NOW, OFFICER SUN.

38:32.394 --> 38:33.804
YOU MIGHT AVOID
THE DEATH SENTENCE.

38:33.937 --> 38:36.098
UNLOCK ME AND THEN
I WILL UNLOCK YOU.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.142
NO, ME.

38:38.275 --> 38:39.936
COME ON, THERE ISN'T TIME.

38:40.569 --> 38:42.230
UNLOCK ME.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.447
DOWN!

38:47.367 --> 38:48.356
IF YOU RUN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

38:48.494 --> 38:49.904
TO FIND SOMEONE
ELSE TO UNLOCK YOU.

38:50.037 --> 38:51.573
THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN

38:51.705 --> 38:53.070
THESE PEACEKEEPER
HANDCUFFS.

38:53.207 --> 38:54.447
GIVE UP NOW, OFFICER SUN.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.915
YOU MIGHT AVOID A
DEATH SENTENCE.

39:00.088 --> 39:00.668
NOW UNLOCK ME.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.298
NO, HE IS A CRIMINAL.

39:02.424 --> 39:04.836
WE ALL ARE.

39:04.968 --> 39:05.957
OFFICER SUN, THEY ARE -

39:06.094 --> 39:07.083
CAN YOU GET ME AWAY FROM HERE?

39:07.221 --> 39:08.085
WHAT?

39:08.222 --> 39:10.178
CAN YOU GET ME OFF THIS ROCK,
AWAY FROM THESE

39:10.307 --> 39:12.013
OVER-AMPED RENT-A-COPS?

39:12.142 --> 39:12.892
AWAY FROM CRAIS?

39:13.018 --> 39:14.349
AND WE TAKE HER, TOO.

39:14.478 --> 39:16.264
WHAT? NEVER.

39:16.396 --> 39:17.522
I WILL TAKE YOU.
YOU ARE MANAGEABLE...

39:17.648 --> 39:22.483
IF SHE STAYS, WE ALL STAY.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.620
NO. I WILL NOT
COME WITH YOU.

39:38.752 --> 39:41.084
YOU'VE BEEN IRREVERSIBLY
CONTAMINATED, REMEMBER?

39:41.213 --> 39:42.453
IT MEANS DEATH.

39:42.589 --> 39:43.419
IT IS MY DUTY.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.460
MY BREEDING SINCE BIRTH.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.503
IT'S WHAT I AM.

39:47.636 --> 39:50.127
YOU CAN BE MORE.

39:59.481 --> 40:00.687
SAY AGAIN, PILOT.

40:00.816 --> 40:03.273
IT IS D'ARGO IN
THE ARRIVING PROWLER.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.017
HE IS TELLING US TO LEAVE
ORBIT IMMEDIATELY.

40:06.446 --> 40:07.606
THANK KHALAAN.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.275
THE PEACEKEEPER FEMALE

40:09.408 --> 40:12.491
AND THAT... OTHER ONE
ARE WITH HIM.

40:12.619 --> 40:13.904
CAN'T YOU SEE HE'S UNDER DURESS.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.447
IT'S A TRAP!

40:15.581 --> 40:17.242
I'LL TAKE HIM IN THE TR...

40:17.374 --> 40:19.080
PILOT BREAK ORBIT.

40:19.209 --> 40:20.073
DESTINATION?

40:20.210 --> 40:21.541
THE UNCHARTED TERRITORIES.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.206
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.169
YOUR ATTENTION.

40:25.299 --> 40:29.087
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PURSUING
PEACEKEEPER CARRIER AND MOYA:

40:29.219 --> 40:31.255
60 METRAS AND CLOSING.

40:31.388 --> 40:34.300
THEY ARE BRINGING AROUND
THEIR FRAG CANNONS.

40:34.433 --> 40:35.843
"FRAG CANNONS?"

40:35.976 --> 40:37.341
WHAT IS THE RANGE OF
THEIR FRAG CANNONS?

40:37.477 --> 40:41.436
I'M AFRAID NEITHER MOYA NOR I
IS SUFFICIENTLY CONVERSANT

40:41.565 --> 40:44.602
WITH PEACEKEEPER TECHNOLOGY.

40:46.361 --> 40:48.477
45 METRAS.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.783
LET'S JUST DO ANOTHER ONE
OF THOSE STARBURST THINGS.

40:54.911 --> 40:58.779
THERE'S NO TIME.
THE LEVIATHAN MUST RESTORE
HER ENERGY RESERVES.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.416
50 METRAS.

41:02.294 --> 41:03.659
I NEED PAPER.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.206
TO WRITE ON.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.455
TURN THIS SHIP AROUND.

41:07.591 --> 41:10.378
WE HAVE TO GO BACK
TOWARD THE PLANET.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.375
Rygel:
GO BACK TO THE PLANET?!

41:19.019 --> 41:21.260
FRAG CANNONS ARE LOCKING ON.

41:22.272 --> 41:23.102
CRICHTON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:23.231 --> 41:24.311
IT'S A THEORY.

41:24.441 --> 41:25.977
IT HAS TO DO WITH OVERCOMING

41:26.109 --> 41:27.645
ATMOSPHERIC FRICTION.

41:27.778 --> 41:29.314
ARE YOU COMPLETELY INSANE?!

41:32.282 --> 41:34.659
LISTEN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO HIT A PRETTY EXACT

41:34.785 --> 41:37.618
TRAJECTORY. CAN YOU DO THAT?

41:37.746 --> 41:39.031
I'M DOING ALL THAT I CAN

41:39.164 --> 41:41.530
MAINTAINING MOYA'S
REGULAR SYSTEMS AT THIS SPEED.

41:41.667 --> 41:44.409
WELL, CAN THIS SHIP THING
BE FLOWN MANUALLY?

41:44.544 --> 41:45.533
MANUALLY?

41:45.671 --> 41:47.161
YES, BUT THERE ARE...

41:47.297 --> 41:48.082
GOOD. YOU DO IT.

41:48.215 --> 41:49.204
I AM NOT TRAINED AS A PILOT.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.798
FINE.
YOU'RE THE EXPERIENCED PILOT.

41:51.927 --> 41:53.212
YOU FLY.

41:53.345 --> 41:54.630
NO.

41:54.763 --> 41:56.424
THIS IS MADNESS!

41:59.017 --> 42:02.225
WEAPONS CONTROL, FULL CHARGE.

42:03.689 --> 42:06.977
IT APPEARS OUR ONLY
ALTERNATIVE IS DEATH.

42:09.444 --> 42:10.103
WHAT A CHARMER.

42:10.237 --> 42:12.273
PILOT, GIVE ME
MANEUVERABILITY NOW!

42:12.406 --> 42:14.362
WE MAY DODGE ONE SHOT,
BUT NEVER...

42:14.491 --> 42:15.321
DO IT!
DO IT!

42:15.450 --> 42:17.782
( frustrated grunt )

42:28.839 --> 42:29.874
FIRE.

42:38.014 --> 42:38.969
TARGET IS BANKING.

42:39.099 --> 42:39.804
REACQUIRE.

42:39.933 --> 42:41.434
BANKING TOWARDS US.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.925
SHE'S ACCELERATING, SIR.

42:48.024 --> 42:49.980
WE END THIS NOW.

42:53.405 --> 42:55.942
JUST GO FOR THE MAXIMUM, AND LET
THE PLANET'S GRAVITY PULL US IN.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.450
HETCH 9!

42:58.869 --> 43:02.032
Crichton:
DIVE STRAIGHT INTO
THE ATMOSPHERE.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.873
28 TO 38 DEGREES.
YOU GOT IT?

43:08.295 --> 43:09.910
DO IT! YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT!

43:10.046 --> 43:12.378
Crichton:
MORE SPEED TO SLINGSHOT US OUT.

43:12.507 --> 43:14.338
WE ARE THERE.

43:35.655 --> 43:38.067
SIR, THE LEVIATHAN,
SHE'S...

43:38.200 --> 43:40.065
I CAN SEE THAT,
LIEUTENANT.

43:40.202 --> 43:43.535
Crichton:
PULL OUT. PULL OUT NOW.

43:53.256 --> 43:55.633
SHE'S OFF OUR SCANNERS, SIR.

43:57.219 --> 43:59.551
WE'VE LOST HER.

44:12.359 --> 44:14.315
Pilot:
IT'S GONE.

44:14.444 --> 44:16.150
THANK YOU.

44:16.279 --> 44:17.143
Pilot:
IT'S GONE.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.236
Zhaan:
YOU CAN LET GO NOW, JOHN.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.065
THANK YOU.

45:00.282 --> 45:07.199
( chanting softly)

45:14.212 --> 45:15.247
WE NEED TO TALK.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.120
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

45:17.257 --> 45:20.294
YOU HAVE A WARRIOR'S INSTINCT.
GOOD.

45:20.427 --> 45:22.588
WE'LL NEED THAT.

45:23.388 --> 45:24.252
COOL.

45:27.267 --> 45:30.304
I HAVE SPENT EIGHT DEGRADING
CYCLES ABOARD THIS SHIP

45:30.437 --> 45:32.143
AND NOW I AM
FINALLY LIBERATED.

45:32.272 --> 45:33.557
CONGRATULATIONS.

45:33.690 --> 45:35.271
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

45:35.400 --> 45:38.608
WHERE YOU'RE FROM,
OR WHAT YOU WANT

45:38.737 --> 45:42.195
BUT IF YOU THREATEN
MY FREEDOM

45:42.324 --> 45:44.861
I'LL KILL YOU.

45:57.380 --> 45:59.712
Aeryn:
THEY'RE A BRUTAL RACE.

45:59.841 --> 46:02.127
UNCIVILIZED.

46:02.260 --> 46:04.842
INDISCRIMINATE IN THEIR
DEPLOYMENT OF VIOLENCE.

46:04.971 --> 46:08.134
RIGHT. UNLIKE YOUR PEOPLE.

46:08.266 --> 46:11.099
MY PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE HELPED YOU
IF YOU HADN'T PUT US

46:11.227 --> 46:12.967
INTO THIS POSITION.

46:13.104 --> 46:14.264
ME? NO, NO, NO.

46:14.397 --> 46:16.183
TRY YOUR BOY CRAIS.

46:16.316 --> 46:18.102
SO, YOU HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM.

46:18.234 --> 46:20.850
I KNOW HE HASN'T FORGOTTEN
ABOUT YOU.

46:20.987 --> 46:22.272
YEAH, WELL, THE, UH

46:22.405 --> 46:25.397
TRANSPARENT PURPLE GUY--
WHAT'S HIS NAME, PILOT?

46:25.533 --> 46:27.910
HE SAID WE'VE PASSED INTO THE
UNCHARTED TERRITORIES

46:28.036 --> 46:32.075
AND THAT YOUR PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION.

46:32.207 --> 46:35.699
CRAIS THINKS YOU KILLED
HIS BROTHER.

46:35.835 --> 46:39.953
IN SUCH A CASE WOULD YOU OBEY
JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES?

46:45.887 --> 46:47.297
LISTEN TO ME.

46:47.430 --> 46:50.046
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE

46:50.183 --> 46:53.175
CHOOSE YOUR ALLEGIANCES
CAREFULLY.

46:53.311 --> 46:56.803
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE'S
ANY GUARANTEES THERE.

47:00.193 --> 47:03.310
(soft squeaking )

47:06.700 --> 47:08.565
COME HERE.

47:10.412 --> 47:13.449
I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.
COME HERE.

47:14.791 --> 47:16.782
HEY, DAD

47:16.918 --> 47:18.624
IT WORKED.

47:18.753 --> 47:22.245
D.K.'s AND MY THEORY--
IT ACTUALLY WORKED.

47:23.216 --> 47:24.456
SORT OF.

47:24.592 --> 47:27.208
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS, UH, CRAZY.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.176
I MEAN, YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GET THIS MESSAGE

47:29.305 --> 47:32.513
BUT I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU
KNOW THAT I'M ALIVE.

47:32.642 --> 47:34.143
( squeaking softly )

47:34.269 --> 47:36.225
OH, HOLD STILL.
HOLD STILL.

47:37.272 --> 47:39.137
DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.

47:39.274 --> 47:41.811
TECHNICALLY, I DON'T KNOW
HOW I GOT HERE, BUT...

47:41.943 --> 47:45.435
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP
TRYING TO GET HOME.

47:48.408 --> 47:50.615
SEE? YOU'RE FIXED.

47:51.745 --> 47:53.155
GO PLAY.

47:58.543 --> 48:00.204
( frustrated growl )
HEY

48:00.336 --> 48:01.712
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

48:01.838 --> 48:04.705
YOUR EQUIPMENT MAY BE WORTH
SOMETHING IN TRADE.

48:04.841 --> 48:07.048
MY EQUIPMENT.

48:07.177 --> 48:09.418
IT'S MINE.

48:10.472 --> 48:13.214
ARE YOU A SOUND SLEEPER?

48:22.942 --> 48:26.184
AND THERE'S LIFE OUT HERE, DAD.

48:26.321 --> 48:28.733
WEIRD, AMAZING...

48:28.865 --> 48:31.197
PSYCHOTIC LIFE...

48:31.326 --> 48:34.693
AND, UH...

48:34.829 --> 48:37.241
IN TECHNICOLOR.

48:40.210 --> 48:42.451
HEY, DAD, YOU KNOW THOSE...

48:42.587 --> 48:46.375
RATTLERS IN THE STOMACH
WE TALKED ABOUT?

48:49.135 --> 48:51.968
WELL, I GOT 'EM NOW.
