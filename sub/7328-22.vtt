WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:03.771
TONY:
Wow. What'd you do,

00:03.804 --> 00:05.373
spend the night
sake-bombing?

00:05.406 --> 00:06.674
KATE:
It's a cold, Tony.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.542
"Sake-bombing"?

00:08.576 --> 00:10.244
Oh, come on, Kate,
don't tell me

00:10.278 --> 00:12.113
you've never heard
of sake-bombing.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.181
Would I ask if...?

00:13.214 --> 00:14.615
Forget it.

00:14.648 --> 00:15.716
I don't want to know.

00:15.749 --> 00:19.553
You take a cup of hot sake,
you drop it in a beer,

00:19.587 --> 00:21.089
you toss it back, and...

00:21.122 --> 00:22.590
( makes explosion noise )

00:22.623 --> 00:24.325
Sake-bombing.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.426
Great for a cold.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.328
I'll stick to honey
and hot tea, thanks.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.462
McGee,

00:28.496 --> 00:30.431
Kate's never been
sake-bombing.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.300
Yeah, I don't think
I have, either.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.302
I work
with a pair of wankers.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.736
And you
make three, DiNozzo.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.071
Morning, boss.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.806
KATE:
Morning.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.174
Cold or flu?

00:40.208 --> 00:41.675
Just plain cold.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.711
Don't worry,
I will sneeze

00:43.744 --> 00:45.113
into my tissues...

00:45.146 --> 00:46.214
unlike some people.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.381
I have allergies, Kate.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.649
Never had allergies.

00:48.682 --> 00:49.783
Never had a cold.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.519
Never had a cold?

00:51.552 --> 00:53.554
Nope. Never had the flu, either.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.389
Why do I
believe that?

00:55.423 --> 00:56.857
If you were a bug,

00:56.890 --> 00:58.726
would you attack Gibbs?

00:58.759 --> 01:00.194
I get colds all the time.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.495
Of course you do,
Probie.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.399
This one is just addressed
to "NCIS Special Agent."

01:05.433 --> 01:07.268
I think that's
mine, McGee.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.736
Huh? How do you know?

01:10.638 --> 01:12.173
I recognize the lips.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.541
And the scent.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.676
Gummy bears?

01:15.709 --> 01:18.112
( chortling )

01:31.659 --> 01:35.429
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:35.463 --> 01:40.334
and CBS

02:17.838 --> 02:19.740
( loud whistling )

02:19.773 --> 02:23.444
We've opened a letter
with white powder.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.780
Use the southeast corridor
to the holding room.

02:26.814 --> 02:27.915
You all know the drill.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.717
Tony.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.918
( phone beeps )

02:30.951 --> 02:34.588
Letter opened in Special
Agent Gibbs's office

02:34.622 --> 02:35.656
dispersed a fine white powder.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.858
Initiating bio-
attack procedures.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.227
Third floor is evacuating.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.628
McGee, you up on procedures?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.396
Yeah, we, uh, we shower,
burn our clothes,

02:42.430 --> 02:43.464
get our blood tested.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.698
Nobody leaves
the building

02:44.732 --> 02:47.401
until the substance
is identified except...

02:47.435 --> 02:48.536
Lucky me.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.871
I win a free trip to Bethesda

02:50.904 --> 02:53.507
to be pricked
like a pincushion.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.742
( loud echoing thud )

02:54.775 --> 02:56.277
They've shut down
the air.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.678
Let's hit the
showers, Tony.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.348
Thought you'd never ask.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.250
Sorry, boss.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.630
TONY:
Who would send me a
letter with anthrax?

03:16.664 --> 03:18.866
Pick a girl, Tony--
any girl.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.000
That's not funny,
Kate.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.369
Yeah, I know.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.436
This is serious.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.238
I know, Tony;
I'm sorry.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.706
At this
very instant,

03:25.739 --> 03:30.711
someone is incinerating
my Ermenegildo Zegna suit,

03:30.744 --> 03:32.413
my Armani tie,

03:32.446 --> 03:34.482
my Dolce Gabbana shirt

03:34.515 --> 03:35.983
and my Gucci shoes.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.618
Hey, you know,
it might not be anthrax.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.420
I like the sound of that,
Probie.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.723
Yeah, it could be smallpox,
bubonic plague, cholera...

03:42.756 --> 03:44.358
Probie!

03:44.392 --> 03:47.361
...foot powder, face powder,
talcum powder...

03:47.395 --> 03:49.363
Honey dust!

03:49.397 --> 03:50.464
"Honey dust"?

03:50.498 --> 03:51.532
Honey dust.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.633
I give it to girls.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.271
I give it to women
at Christmastime.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.539
Very sensuous.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.707
You apply it with a feather.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.410
( chuckling ):
You don't use the whole chicken?

04:02.443 --> 04:03.677
McGEE:
I never heard
of Honey dust.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.479
Yeah, that's because
your mother raised you

04:05.513 --> 04:06.414
to respect women, McGee.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.983
It makes a woman's skin
feel silky smooth.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.720
When kissed,
it tastes like honey.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.057
Got a box of Honey dust
last Christmas.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.592
No card.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.696
Uhh...

04:22.730 --> 04:24.865
Think the post office
screwed up, Boss.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.834
Someone else got your bottle
of Jack and you got their...

04:26.867 --> 04:27.801
KATE:
Hey!

04:27.835 --> 04:30.571
Doesn't the post office
irradiate our mail?

04:30.604 --> 04:31.572
Yeah, that's right!

04:31.605 --> 04:32.540
All Federal mail

04:32.573 --> 04:35.309
is funneled through
the Ion Beam facility

04:35.343 --> 04:36.644
at Bridgeport, New Jersey.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.878
If it has DNA, it dies.

04:37.911 --> 04:41.582
The diseases that you name,
they have DNA?

04:41.615 --> 04:42.683
McGEE:
They do.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.618
Oh, you should have let him
squirm.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.588
( laughing ):
Then, it's no worries!

04:47.621 --> 04:51.291
Unless the post office
screwed up again.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.941
( vacuum running )

05:25.693 --> 05:29.897
GIBBS:
You should have given
the letter to me, McGee.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.499
I know, boss.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.033
It's not McGee's fault.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.035
Tony snatched it
out of his hands.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.136
So, now it's
my bad?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.505
You did grab it, Tony.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.039
Lame excuse, Probie.

05:39.072 --> 05:39.840
You should
have stopped me.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.575
Where do you think
you're going?

05:41.609 --> 05:43.511
Find out who
sent the letter.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.512
Uh-uh-uh!

05:44.545 --> 05:46.046
You cannot leave autopsy!

05:46.079 --> 05:47.681
It's negative-pressured

05:47.715 --> 05:50.751
so airborne pathogens
can't contaminate

05:50.784 --> 05:51.585
the rest
of the building.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.787
Ducky, I've been scrubbed,
sanitized...

05:53.821 --> 05:55.523
for all I know,
sterilized.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.591
I have an investigation
to open.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.594
DUCKY:
I have a possible
contagion to contain.

06:00.628 --> 06:03.731
Until your blood test
clears you,

06:03.764 --> 06:07.535
I cannot permit you
to leave this room.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.805
Who opened the envelope?

06:11.839 --> 06:12.473
He did.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.942
No, no, no... it wasn't me!

06:14.975 --> 06:16.076
TONY:
I'm just kidding.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.144
I'm your pincushion.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.012
Did you inhale any powder?

06:19.046 --> 06:21.181
I might have.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.083
We took blood.
Jimmy...?

06:23.116 --> 06:25.085
I have four blood vials
on ice, to go.

06:25.118 --> 06:25.719
( sneezes )

06:28.822 --> 06:30.958
It's a cold.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.960
I had it before I came in
this morning.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.962
Which makes you
even more susceptible

06:34.995 --> 06:36.530
to airborne pathogens.

06:36.564 --> 06:37.898
You should go to hospital, too.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.066
Oh, no...

06:39.099 --> 06:40.067
Kate, play it safe.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.068
Go with Tony.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.936
That's safe?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.642
( sighs )

06:48.676 --> 06:51.445
How long are we going
to have to stay in isolation?

06:51.479 --> 06:52.580
At least overnight.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.714
Do you have double beds

06:53.747 --> 06:54.915
'cause I hate it
when you get that crease

06:54.948 --> 06:56.016
when you push...

06:56.049 --> 06:59.052
If I get anthrax,
how will you feel?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.854
Not as bad as you, DiNozzo.

07:00.888 --> 07:01.989
Let's go!

07:02.022 --> 07:03.156
I'm warning you,
DiNozzo.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.559
I do not feel well.
You need to relax.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.894
You need a foot massage.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.496
KATE:
I don't want you
anywhere near my feet.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.463
TONY:
You have pretty feet.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.031
KATE:
I don't want you
touching my mattress.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.733
TONY:
If you don't
feel well....

07:12.766 --> 07:14.835
( arguing continues
in distance )

07:17.204 --> 07:18.972
( electronic rock playing )

07:46.199 --> 07:48.669
So how long
to Atlanta?

07:48.702 --> 07:51.204
Um, less
than an hour.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.241
Your music's sweet.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.778
So are you... ooh!

08:00.548 --> 08:01.749
Talk to Mama.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.156
GIBBS:
I didn't take you

08:09.189 --> 08:10.257
for the cheerleader type,
Abby.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.792
Oh, I'm not.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.893
Grammy taught me that.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.795
She was an Olympic swimmer.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.730
Won the silver
in the 200-meter butterfly.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.532
What does swimming
have to do

08:18.566 --> 08:19.900
with cartwheeling?

08:19.933 --> 08:20.801
Nothing.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.870
I don't understand.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.205
You can't think
logically with Abby.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.140
Her mind operates
like a pachinko machine.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.809
What was the powder, Abby?

08:28.842 --> 08:29.743
White.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.111
With a hint of tan.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.212
Abs...

08:32.245 --> 08:33.947
That's all I know
until my baby
speaks to me.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.617
I'm auto-sampling
for anthrax, botulism,

08:36.650 --> 08:37.718
plague, cholera...

08:37.751 --> 08:39.219
all those nasty
little bio-buggers.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.287
How long?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.622
A couple of hours.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.090
I thought you said
these tests were fast.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.593
It's not a pregnancy test,
Gibbs.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.629
You should drink more water.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.863
Tony!

08:49.897 --> 08:51.832
Your urine's too dark.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.933
I have a cold.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.135
I don't believe
you're commenting
on my... ew!

08:55.168 --> 08:56.136
Neither do I.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.705
Dr. Brad Pitt.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.039
Yes,
it's my real name

08:59.072 --> 09:00.841
and no,
we're not related.

09:00.874 --> 09:04.211
Wish we were... I'd love
to meet Angelina Jolie.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.246
If I said what he said,
you'd...

09:06.279 --> 09:07.347
...elbow me.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.983
It's not the Four Seasons,

09:10.017 --> 09:12.720
but let's hope
you're not here long.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.198
Negative pressure?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.366
Mm-hmm.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.668
Air can flow in, but not out.

09:30.003 --> 09:33.006
I'd like to meet
Lieutenant Emma Ingham,

09:33.040 --> 09:34.742
your duty nurse
for tonight.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.710
Hi, guys. How are you?

09:36.744 --> 09:38.746
PITT:
As a precaution,
I'm starting your prophylaxis

09:38.779 --> 09:39.847
with streptomycin.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.816
( chuckling )

09:42.850 --> 09:44.351
Prophylaxis
is a measure taken

09:44.384 --> 09:46.620
for the prevention
of disease, Tony.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.155
That's why I use them.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.890
( chuckling )
Oh, you don't want
to encourage him.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.391
Sorry.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.027
Take any bed
you want, you guys.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.295
Thank you, Nurse Emma.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.000
PITT:
But it's prudent
to keep

10:00.033 --> 10:02.035
some separation in case
one of you has been infected.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.303
Thank you, Doctor.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.172
Brad. We're informal here.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.040
Kate.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.043
( Tony clears throat )

10:10.077 --> 10:11.912
Using sun lamps...
Brad?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.346
UV... kills bacteria

10:13.380 --> 10:14.815
in the air...

10:14.848 --> 10:16.650
although I can arrange
for a sun lamp if you wish.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.151
Oh, not for me.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.753
It's for Kate.

10:19.787 --> 10:20.754
What?

10:20.788 --> 10:22.022
Yeah, a little nude
sunbathing

10:22.055 --> 10:23.657
might get rid
of those tan lines.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.894
Doctor, could you put him
to sleep? Please.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.295
Bye, Nurse Emma.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.629
Bye.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.200
GIBBS:
SWAK?

10:33.233 --> 10:35.068
ABBY:
It's "Sealed With a Kiss,"
Gibbs.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.804
Didn't you ever get
a love letter?

10:36.837 --> 10:39.673
Does a "Dear John"
count?

10:39.707 --> 10:41.441
Oh...

10:41.474 --> 10:43.210
I feel sorry for you, Gibbs.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.945
Is there a return address?

10:44.978 --> 10:49.049
"27 Old Mill Bottom Road,

10:49.082 --> 10:50.350
Annapolis, Maryland."

10:50.383 --> 10:51.051
McGee, got that?

10:51.084 --> 10:53.320
Got it.
Wish I had my PDA.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.221
Use Ducky's.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.723
Ah... Agent Gibbs,

10:55.756 --> 10:57.991
sir...
Dr. Mallard doesn't have....

10:58.025 --> 10:59.793
Requisition replacement
cell phones and weapons

10:59.827 --> 11:00.861
for my team. Go!

11:00.894 --> 11:02.029
Pistols?

11:02.062 --> 11:04.031
Well, no, Palmer,
crossbows,

11:04.064 --> 11:05.398
if you think
they might work better.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.500
Canceled stamp?

11:07.534 --> 11:09.136
ABBY:
Noon yesterday, Annapolis.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.037
Open it.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.841
Normally I'd request a "please,"

11:13.874 --> 11:15.843
but considering
the situation....

11:15.876 --> 11:17.110
Boss, I can't find Ducky's PDA.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.279
McGee, it's a pad and a pencil.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.954
DUCKY:
Ah, beautiful
calligraphy.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.289
Beautiful paper.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.792
Must be 32-pound cotton rag.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.260
Abby, does that mean
you can trace it?

11:33.293 --> 11:35.495
The watermark will tell
me where it was made,

11:35.528 --> 11:37.865
when it was made
and who sold it.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.800
The person that sent this
may as well have signed it.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.001
You know,
there was a time

11:41.034 --> 11:42.502
when every young woman
of breeding

11:42.535 --> 11:43.837
was taught calligraphy.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.205
My mother still tries,

11:45.238 --> 11:47.107
but her hand shakes so

11:47.140 --> 11:49.810
that even I can't read
all her missives.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.780
Can you read this missive,
Ducky?

11:52.813 --> 11:53.881
Oh, yes.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.282
It's perfectly legible.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.484
ABBY:
Um...

11:57.517 --> 11:59.987
I think he means
read it out loud.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.488
Oh, sorry.
Of course.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.057
Uh... "If you are reading this

12:04.091 --> 12:06.026
"and have not initiated

12:06.059 --> 12:08.028
"biological attack procedures,

12:08.061 --> 12:10.130
"I suggest you do so
immediately,

12:10.163 --> 12:12.299
"since the powder dispersed

12:12.332 --> 12:15.035
"by opening this envelope

12:15.068 --> 12:18.171
"contains genetically
altered...

12:18.205 --> 12:20.974
...Y. pestis!"

12:22.175 --> 12:23.811
Which is Latin for what...?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.816
Plague.

12:36.857 --> 12:40.060
The powder in that envelope
carries bubonic plague?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.229
Pneumonic is more likely.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.831
There's more than one?

12:43.864 --> 12:44.965
Oh, there are three, actually.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.199
But pneumonic is by far

12:46.233 --> 12:47.167
the most dangerous

12:47.200 --> 12:48.001
since it can
be spread

12:48.035 --> 12:50.437
simply by breathing
the Y. Pestis

12:50.470 --> 12:51.338
particles.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.540
Tony must have breathed in
some of it.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.842
It may not be alive.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.110
Y. Pestis needs a host
or moisture

12:57.144 --> 12:59.112
for it to survive more
than a few hours.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.314
Plus, it was irradiated when
it when through the mail, boss.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.416
I got Honey Dust
for Christmas, McGee!

13:03.450 --> 13:06.286
I'll narrow my test
to pneumonic Y. Pestis.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.455
If I can isolate the strain,

13:08.488 --> 13:11.324
then Bethesda can hit it
with a specific antibiotic.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.860
Yeah, well,

13:12.893 --> 13:13.861
that may not help.

13:13.894 --> 13:14.828
It says here,

13:14.862 --> 13:17.564
"I have genetically altered
the Y. Pestis

13:17.597 --> 13:21.935
to render it
impervious to antimicrobials."

13:21.969 --> 13:23.270
That bitch!

13:23.303 --> 13:25.205
She created a strain that

13:25.238 --> 13:27.040
antibiotics can't whack!

13:27.074 --> 13:28.909
Ducky, give Bethesda a heads up.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.878
Right.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.112
GIBBS:
A SWAK does not mean

13:32.145 --> 13:34.014
that this bitch
couldn't be a bastard.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.083
ABBY:
You're so right, Gibbs.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.886
I have this friend
who's a transvestite.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.553
Her lips could out-SWAK
Angelina Jolie's.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.388
Remember, McGee?

13:41.421 --> 13:42.956
You met her
at my birthday party.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.358
Yeah. The, uh,
low-cut red dress

13:45.392 --> 13:47.027
with the built-in plastic...

13:47.060 --> 13:48.195
I saw that, Gibbs!

13:48.228 --> 13:50.597
Read, or you'll feel it!

13:50.630 --> 13:52.432
Not while you're down there.

13:52.465 --> 13:53.233
What?

13:53.266 --> 13:55.502
"However, there is
an antidote..."

13:55.535 --> 13:57.337
She made a magic bullet!

13:57.370 --> 13:59.973
"...which, if administered
within 32 of infection,

14:00.007 --> 14:02.342
"will eradicate the disease.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.444
"To procure the antidote,

14:04.477 --> 14:07.147
"NCIS must make public
the true results reported

14:07.180 --> 14:09.549
in dossier R-Zero
Three-Seven-Seven."

14:09.582 --> 14:10.583
McGee, pull up the file.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.152
Yeah. Romeo Zero
Three-Seven-Seven.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.386
On it, boss!
That it?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.022
That's all she wrote.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.160
It's gilded inside.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.996
I can see the SWAK through...

14:23.030 --> 14:24.064
Uh-oh!

14:25.232 --> 14:26.666
( gasps )

14:26.699 --> 14:28.902
We have a moisture strip
in here!

14:28.936 --> 14:31.571
Yeah, keeping the bug alive
until the letter is opened.

14:31.604 --> 14:32.906
Afraid so, Gibbs.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.241
GIBBS:
Check that canceled stamp, Abs!

14:34.274 --> 14:37.210
One way to get
around postal irradiation--

14:37.244 --> 14:38.578
to not to use the post office!

14:39.579 --> 14:40.981
( beeping )

14:41.014 --> 14:42.615
I-I spoke with a
Doctor Brad Pitt.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.051
You're kidding.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.218
No, that's his name.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.453
He made a point
of stressing

14:46.486 --> 14:47.955
he is not related in any way

14:47.988 --> 14:49.356
to the actor.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.324
Hey, did you hear when, um,
Brad and Jen split up...

14:51.358 --> 14:52.225
Abby!

14:52.259 --> 14:53.160
Gibbs, I can't

14:53.193 --> 14:55.195
until I can put this
under a microscope.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.264
And I can't do
until NCID gives me

14:57.297 --> 14:58.631
approval to irradiate.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.533
Okay. Which will be when?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.602
The Navy is sending
a sample to Atlanta.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.271
It should be there...

15:04.304 --> 15:05.939
well, now.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.240
And then it'll
be 12 hours

15:07.274 --> 15:08.375
for DNA
confirmation.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.210
Duck, what's
the incubation period?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.544
A day at most.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.146
How long until it kills?

15:13.180 --> 15:15.015
Oh, not very long, I'm afraid.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.649
In the fourteenth century,

15:16.683 --> 15:18.385
the novelist Boccaccio wrote

15:18.418 --> 15:21.521
that plague victims had lunch
with their friends

15:21.554 --> 15:25.258
and dinner with
their ancestors in paradise.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.660
McGee, where's the file?!

15:27.694 --> 15:29.362
Boss, I cannot
access it...

15:29.396 --> 15:30.330
Ducky, we're coming up!

15:30.363 --> 15:32.265
No, we've already been
through this, Gibbs.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.101
You can't!
( Ducky sighs )

15:35.302 --> 15:37.570
( snapping fingers rhythmically
)

15:37.604 --> 15:39.472
Know what this feels like?

15:39.506 --> 15:42.309
I'm afraid to ask.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.245
Like I'm
the King of Cool.
Elvis?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.381
TONY ( over speaker ):
Elvis was the King
of Rock and Roll.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.117
Travolta is the King of Cool.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.518
KATE:
Well, thanks
( giggles )

15:51.551 --> 15:52.685
for the clarification.

15:52.719 --> 15:56.489
And do you know why
I feel like Travolta?

15:56.523 --> 15:59.259
I feel a movie coming on.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.661
The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.031
Travolta plays this boy

16:04.064 --> 16:05.632
born with an immune deficiency.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.034
This was before AIDS.

16:07.067 --> 16:10.503
He lives in this
giant plastic bubble.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.539
Tony...

16:12.572 --> 16:14.307
Tony, please.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.143
We're stuck here together.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.045
Could we just make a pact?

16:18.078 --> 16:20.180
Until we're out,

16:20.213 --> 16:23.550
I won't make fun of all
the stupid things you say,

16:23.583 --> 16:26.319
and you won't tell me
any more film scenarios.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.520
Deal?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.122
Deal.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.258
Thank you.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.459
Emma.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.328
Yes?
You may find this of interest.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.197
You look pretty without
the mask, by the way.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.598
Ralph Bellamy plays the doctor.

16:38.631 --> 16:39.699
Now, Ralph Bellamy was this

16:39.732 --> 16:42.202
great old-time actor--
he was in His Girl Friday

16:42.235 --> 16:43.736
with Cary Grant
and Rosalind Russell.

16:43.770 --> 16:49.076
I cannot believe that
Gibbs broke protocol!

16:49.109 --> 16:51.211
( laughs ):
He didn't.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.379
He left autopsy.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.247
But not isolation.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.285
McGee.
Yeah?

16:58.318 --> 16:59.819
( loudly ):
You use Abby's computer

16:59.852 --> 17:01.554
to access that case file.

17:01.588 --> 17:02.689
On it.
Okay.

17:02.722 --> 17:03.623
( beeping )

17:07.727 --> 17:09.529
GIBBS:
Abby.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.664
Pull surveillance videos
from the squad room--

17:11.698 --> 17:14.101
everything from 2300 last night,
when I left,

17:14.134 --> 17:15.668
until McGee came in
this morning.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.470
You got to get
a life, Gibbs.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.539
Last thing I need
is another wife.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.242
Life. You got
to get a life.

17:26.679 --> 17:30.250
Boss! Boss, I found the file.
It's a rape case.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.519
Get the investigating
agent down here.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.088
I-I can't. It was Pacci.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.664
Put it up on the plasma, McGee.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.698
Okay.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.838
GIBBS:
Sarah Lowell, age 21.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.540
Senior at Vassar.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.242
Raped February 10, '01,

17:55.275 --> 17:57.644
at the Admiral's Bay Hotel
in Annapolis.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.812
Surely you remember
the case, Jethro.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.882
The maid found the poor girl
naked, tied to the bed

18:02.915 --> 18:04.751
two days after she was raped.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.686
Duck, contact Cassie Yates
in Norfolk.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.155
Tell her what happened.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.222
I need her help.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.257
Yeah, good idea.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.824
Gibbs,
I thought Cassie

18:11.858 --> 18:14.194
was working
narcotics suppression?

18:14.227 --> 18:16.729
Four years ago,
Cassie was Pacci's probie.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.730
Ah.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.367
The victim was visiting
Annapolis to register

18:20.400 --> 18:23.470
for an advanced study program
at Saint John's.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.739
Police had the case for three
days before they called us in.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.408
They found a Navy suspect?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.343
A dozen of them--
firsties were partying

18:30.377 --> 18:32.379
at the hotel
the night of the assault.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.746
Firsties?

18:33.780 --> 18:34.814
Academy seniors.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.350
They'd just got their
fleet assignments, and...

18:37.384 --> 18:39.186
Are you scanning?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.221
Gibbs, I can multitask:
I can listen to you;

18:41.254 --> 18:42.855
I can scan the video;
I can rub my tummy...

18:42.889 --> 18:44.924
DNA testing cleared them.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.393
Closed our investigation.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.894
But someone wants it reopened.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.462
( typing )

18:49.496 --> 18:50.730
McGee!

18:50.763 --> 18:52.732
Call Annapolis PD.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.501
I want their file
on this case.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.602
I spoke to Cassie.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.836
She remembers the case.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.838
She'll be here
in 15 minutes.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.673
From Norfolk?
No, Anacostia.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.475
She's working a drug sting.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.344
Boss... Boss, I can't call.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.380
They're not gonna be able
to hear me.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.649
I'm gonna use the computer.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.651
ABBY:
Gibbs!

19:11.684 --> 19:13.786
Look who else
doesn't have a life.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.856
Tony came back
around midnight.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.494
He does his best work
at night.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.496
So he tells us.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.265
Here's Tony leaving.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.370
That's Ben, the mail boy.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.639
He didn't do it.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.640
Why not?

19:33.673 --> 19:34.807
He's a vegan.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.509
Hitler was a vegan.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.245
Hitler was a vegetarian.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.612
Big difference.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.381
Vegans are so
against cruelty,

19:41.414 --> 19:43.250
they won't even
use cosmetics

19:43.283 --> 19:44.917
tested on animals.
Abigail?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.653
Could...

19:46.686 --> 19:50.857
Y. Pestis be altered to
withstand irradiation?

19:50.890 --> 19:51.858
No way.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.527
Altered or not,
it's still a living organism.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.797
Could the gilding
in the envelope protect it?

19:57.830 --> 20:00.667
It would have to be
at least ten mils thick.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.602
This is barely one.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.505
Uh-oh.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.906
Abby, I do not
want to hear

20:06.939 --> 20:08.308
any more uh-ohs.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.709
Sorry.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.678
But this SWAK didn't
bleed through.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.446
There's another one inside.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.648
Get that letter out here
where you can examine it!

20:15.682 --> 20:17.984
Gibbs, I told you,
I have to wait
for Atlanta to...

20:18.017 --> 20:19.986
Any doubt
it's pneumonic plague?

20:20.019 --> 20:23.290
No, but...
Then no buts, okay?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.258
We're losing time.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.860
Kill those bugs!

20:29.462 --> 20:30.597
Now!

20:33.900 --> 20:36.936
Think they really zap bugs?

20:36.969 --> 20:38.971
What?

20:39.005 --> 20:40.607
These blue lights.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.309
Are you serious?

20:42.342 --> 20:45.978
Ever heard
of a placebo, Kate?

20:48.748 --> 20:49.882
Tony...

20:49.916 --> 20:53.386
placebos are administered
for a psychological effect.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.955
Precisely. How do you
know these lamps

20:55.988 --> 20:59.826
aren't there to make us think
they're helping, hmm?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.961
Maybe because they're there

21:01.994 --> 21:05.798
to kill whatever bugs
we breathe into the air.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.603
You may have a point.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.741
You're afraid,
aren't you?

21:14.774 --> 21:16.008
( laughs )

21:16.042 --> 21:18.478
Kate, come on.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.347
Me afraid?

21:20.380 --> 21:22.315
You ever seen me afraid?

21:22.349 --> 21:25.985
Well, not when the danger's
something that we can confront.

21:28.054 --> 21:32.024
But all we can do
here is lie around

21:32.058 --> 21:34.761
and hope that
we're not infected.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.697
Now who's afraid?

21:37.730 --> 21:40.767
Anyone with half a brain.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.670
( laughs ):
I take that back.

21:43.703 --> 21:47.540
You're not afraid.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.514
All the blood cultures

21:54.547 --> 21:58.918
came back negative except
for Special Agent DiNozzo's.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.456
He's infected with Y. Pestis.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.623
Damn it, Abby.
How much longer?

22:36.656 --> 22:37.457
Gibbs.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.926
Patience is not
your virtue, is it?

22:39.959 --> 22:41.661
Look at the plasma.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.767
Moldy bread?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.068
It's a Y. pestis microbe

22:49.101 --> 22:50.837
from the powder in the letter.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.038
This the Y. pestis

22:52.071 --> 22:54.841
as the human race has known
it for half the millennium--

22:54.874 --> 22:56.443
the strain of the plague
to fight with antibiotics.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.578
The one in the letter
has blue tips.

22:58.611 --> 23:01.514
It's been genetically altered
to resist antibiotics.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.450
You catch that, you're stuck
in the dark ages,

23:03.483 --> 23:06.819
which personally I wouldn't
mind, until it killed me.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.422
This wasn't whipped up
in your local meth house.

23:09.456 --> 23:12.425
No, this took
a hot molecular biologist

23:12.459 --> 23:14.861
and a big-bucks lab
to make this bio-weapon.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.829
( bell dinging )
Oh, my baby's calling.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.865
I ran a mass spec on the SWAK.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.835
You're analyzing lipstick
instead of the letter?

23:22.869 --> 23:25.438
Well, I figured anyone
who's into calligraphy

23:25.472 --> 23:27.139
has got to wear
esoteric lipstick.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.442
And since all lipsticks
are tested by the FDA...

23:29.476 --> 23:30.710
You'll identify the brand.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.745
Yeah. If it's as rare
as I think it is,

23:32.779 --> 23:34.013
I can find out
who sold it.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.682
Oh, yeah, that's
good thinking, Abbs.

23:35.715 --> 23:36.683
What?

23:36.716 --> 23:37.950
Good thinking, Abby!

23:37.984 --> 23:39.151
I don't know, Gibbs,
I can't hear you.

23:39.185 --> 23:40.587
Ahh!
It must be the helmet
on your head.

23:40.620 --> 23:41.621
Good thinking.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.490
Not nice, Gibbs.
Not nice.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.058
This is weird.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.860
All the basics are there--

23:47.894 --> 23:51.498
wax, oil, eosin dye,
titanium dioxide,

23:51.531 --> 23:53.733
but they're at such
low levels...

23:53.766 --> 23:54.934
( beeping )

23:54.967 --> 23:55.635
Whoa.

23:55.668 --> 23:56.736
What is that?

23:56.769 --> 24:01.040
The reason the Y. pestis
survived postal irradiation.

24:01.073 --> 24:04.911
72 percent of the lipstick
is pure lead.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.217
A lead SWAK on the outside
of the envelope.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.620
Lead SWAK on the inside.

24:13.653 --> 24:14.754
In between?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.757
Y. pestis on a moisture pad.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.027
This is one smart bitch.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.194
Wash your mouth out
with purple soap.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.896
Cassie.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.899
Well, are you
suppressing drugs

24:26.933 --> 24:27.900
or selling them?

24:27.934 --> 24:28.701
Working undercover.

24:28.735 --> 24:30.102
Everything I'm wearing's
confiscated,

24:30.136 --> 24:31.571
even the La Perla underwear.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.371
Nice.

24:32.404 --> 24:35.041
Gibbs, is that you
playing Teletubby?

24:35.074 --> 24:36.543
This the anthrax letter?

24:36.576 --> 24:38.578
It's not anthrax,
it-/////!s plague.

24:38.611 --> 24:39.512
Thank God.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.080
Anthrax scares the hell
out of me. May I?

24:41.113 --> 24:43.049
Yeah.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.786
I know this return address.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.920
Back-tracked it

24:47.954 --> 24:49.188
to the Admiral's Bay
Hotel, Annapolis,

24:49.221 --> 24:50.823
where the girl
was raped.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.525
DUCKY:
Gibbs. Gibbs.
All the blood tests

24:52.559 --> 24:53.860
came back negative

24:53.893 --> 24:54.927
except...
Tony.

24:54.961 --> 24:55.862
Yeah.

24:55.895 --> 24:58.731
Get it off, Duck.

24:58.765 --> 24:59.932
Is he sick yet?

24:59.966 --> 25:00.933
Not outwardly,

25:00.967 --> 25:02.869
but the doctor says his
temperature's elevating.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.704
The Y. pestis is attacking

25:04.737 --> 25:05.905
his pulmonary system.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.073
Hi, Cassie.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.007
Hey, Ducky.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.809
How far are we
into this 32-hour window?

25:09.842 --> 25:10.810
Too far.

25:10.843 --> 25:11.944
Tony will begin coughing soon.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.212
When his sputum
becomes bloody,

25:13.245 --> 25:15.582
he'll only have
a few hours to live.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.916
Abby, get that damn
letter out of there.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.818
I'm getting it.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.257
This is too easy, Gibbs.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.794
Custom paper and calligraphy
that's traceable.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.096
A gene-altering
bio-attack.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.631
You know who sent it.

25:31.664 --> 25:32.665
No.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.034
But I know who they
want us to think sent it.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.203
TONY:
Bedtime snack, Brad?

25:37.236 --> 25:40.807
Mm. I.V. drip increases
the efficacy of streptomycin.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.109
They teach you "efficacy"
at Harvard Medical?

25:43.142 --> 25:44.777
Michigan.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.715
Can't be.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.016
It's too weird.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.283
Why, you a Wolverine, too?

25:51.317 --> 25:53.119
Buckeye.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.088
Wait.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.289
You're that DiNozzo?

25:57.323 --> 25:58.958
'92. Columbus.

25:58.991 --> 25:59.992
We kissed our sisters.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.761
13-13 tie.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.262
You broke your leg
in the fourth quarter.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.632
You broke my leg
in the fourth quarter.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.333
Oh, my God.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.636
They're gonna start
bonging beers next.

26:11.638 --> 26:12.839
I don't think so.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.306
Oh, no,
you don't know, Tony.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.743
He epitomizes sophomoric.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.912
His blood test
came back positive.

26:24.350 --> 26:25.652
Positive...

26:25.685 --> 26:26.686
You're okay.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.655
He's the only one infected.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.757
BRAD:
So you didn't feel like
an old man at spring break?

26:30.790 --> 26:31.858
TONY:
You kidding?

26:31.891 --> 26:33.993
( chuckling )

26:34.026 --> 26:38.130
( slightly breathless ):
Coeds love a... mature man
who can bong a beer

26:38.164 --> 26:40.166
in under six seconds.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.600
( chuckling ):
Leaves me out.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.975
So tell me, Doc,
what have I got?

26:51.210 --> 26:52.679
Pneumonic plague.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.215
Plague?

26:57.784 --> 27:00.052
( chuckles )

27:00.086 --> 27:01.821
Plague.
Yeah, Tony,
plague.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.022
'Cause only you
would go off

27:03.055 --> 27:04.857
and get a disease
from the Dark Ages.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.292
I didn't put plague
in the letter.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.760
You opened it.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.061
Yeah, so I opened it.

27:09.095 --> 27:10.229
What are you so upset about?

27:10.262 --> 27:13.099
It's not like you're lying...

27:13.132 --> 27:17.203
Yeah.
That's right, Travolta.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.039
I'm infected, too.

27:21.708 --> 27:24.276
Oh, Kate, I'm sorry.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.745
Well, you're going
to be sorrier.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.715
No. Don't tell me Gibbs got it?

27:28.748 --> 27:30.883
No, no. Just us.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.252
But I am going to make
your life hell.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.354
How? You can't be
worse than plague.

27:36.923 --> 27:37.990
Maybe you can.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.191
Maybe she can.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.093
I'm warning you,
DiNozzo.

27:41.127 --> 27:45.231
You know, I recall a couple
of plague flicks.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.033
I'm going to tell Emma
all of your dating tricks.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.235
Flesh and Blood comes to mind.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.838
Paul Verhoeven directed.
Rutger Hauer starred.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.372
Tony thinks
speaking Italian

27:53.405 --> 27:54.373
turns women on.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.374
Obviously you never saw

27:55.407 --> 27:57.109
Jamie Lee Curtis
in A Fish called Wanda.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.011
Kate...
I know.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.046
You want to start my I.V.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.948
( sneezes )

28:01.981 --> 28:04.917
If I catch your cold,
I'm gonna be very pissed.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.957
She'll be okay, right?

28:13.826 --> 28:14.827
( beeping )

28:15.895 --> 28:17.329
Hey, McGee.
Yeah?!

28:17.363 --> 28:18.998
Special Agent Yates
needs your computer.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.399
Cassie.

28:20.432 --> 28:21.433
Hey, McGee.
Can I sit in?

28:21.467 --> 28:23.002
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, sure.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.070
Boss...

28:24.103 --> 28:26.372
Cassie and I had parking spaces
next to each other

28:26.405 --> 28:27.206
at Norfolk.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.008
Why are you yelling
at me, McGee?

28:29.041 --> 28:32.044
So you can hear me
through your... helmet.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.880
The blood tests
were negative.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.148
( hissing )

28:36.182 --> 28:37.516
Sweet.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.018
Not for DiNozzo.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.888
Positive?

28:41.921 --> 28:43.222
Is he going to be okay?

28:43.255 --> 28:46.192
If he isn't,
he'll be answering to me.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.761
( computer blipping )

28:48.795 --> 28:49.762
Almost there.

28:49.796 --> 28:50.763
No, Cassie, I already

28:50.797 --> 28:52.031
downloaded the NCIS report

28:52.064 --> 28:53.332
from the rape investigation.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.201
My notes are
in my training file.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.235
I was only a Probie,

28:56.268 --> 28:58.104
but Pacci had me
interview Sarah.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.505
Yeah, you're a female

28:59.538 --> 29:00.773
about the same age.

29:00.807 --> 29:01.908
Easier to talk to you

29:01.941 --> 29:02.875
than it is a male agent.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.912
Didn't help.
She couldn't remember a thing.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.915
Traumatic amnesia.
Not unusual for rape cases.

29:08.948 --> 29:12.051
GIBBS:
If she had amnesia,
who accused the midshipmen?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.452
Her mother.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.154
Recognize her?

29:15.187 --> 29:16.923
DUCKY:
Vaguely familiar.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.524
How about in this photo?

29:18.557 --> 29:20.827
Good God, yes.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.962
That photo was on every
front page in the world.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.798
She was more famous
than Hanoi Jane.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.199
Blow that up.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.968
Get closer
on the headband.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.404
ABBY:
Oh, my God, that's a SWAK.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.073
She a microbiologist?

29:34.106 --> 29:37.309
No. But the best in
the world work for her.

29:37.343 --> 29:40.412
Hanna's CEO of Lowell
Pharmaceuticals.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.281
McGee, I want
a search warrant.

29:42.314 --> 29:43.215
On it, boss.

29:43.249 --> 29:44.316
Grab a change of clothes,

29:44.350 --> 29:45.484
meet me downstairs
in five.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.819
Go to Bethesda,

29:46.853 --> 29:48.320
keep me updated
on Tony's condition.

29:48.354 --> 29:49.188
Of course.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.357
Find out why Kate
hasn't checked in.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.892
You got it.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.827
I got the phones,

29:54.861 --> 29:56.963
but they wouldn't
trust me with a weapon.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.097
I wouldn't either, Jimmy.

30:04.070 --> 30:07.139
That's Agent DiNozzo's
cell phone, sir.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.140
Gibbs.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.842
( elevator dings )

30:09.876 --> 30:12.444
( coughing )

30:12.478 --> 30:14.246
DR. PITT:
Why are you doing this, Kate?

30:14.280 --> 30:17.383
Damned if I know.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.251
But I'm doing it.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.486
You're not going
to tell Tony.

30:20.519 --> 30:23.522
Well, I've already informed
Dr. Mallard you're not infected.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.524
Ducky will understand.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.293
Gibbs will be the problem.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.997
No, the problem is
is that Tony can infect you.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.632
What, with all the UV lights
and air scrubbers...

30:33.665 --> 30:35.334
or are they just here
for patient morale?

30:35.367 --> 30:37.136
I cannot permit you
to stay.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.539
This strain has been genetically
altered to resist antibiotics.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.641
You realize
what that means?

30:42.674 --> 30:46.512
That the I.V. in Tony's arm
is useless.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.214
So why do it?

30:48.247 --> 30:49.949
Well, it can't hurt.

30:49.982 --> 30:52.218
And it gives him...

30:52.251 --> 30:53.385
Hope?
Yeah.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.486
Kate.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.388
Tell Dr. Brad

30:56.422 --> 30:59.325
about the wet T-shirt
contest you won.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.929
Tell Emma about the
transsexual you tongued.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.897
That never happened.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.933
That never happened...

31:06.966 --> 31:10.136
( coughs )

31:10.169 --> 31:13.139
( coughing )

31:17.043 --> 31:19.078
Thanks for passing along
the cold, Kate.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.596
How do you want
to handle this?

31:37.629 --> 31:38.597
The subtle approach.

31:38.630 --> 31:39.966
You serve the warrant.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.467
I'll shove my Sig
in her face.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.302
CASSIE:
Gibbs, Hanna Lowell's
been arrested

31:43.335 --> 31:44.937
at more protests
than Jesse Jackson.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.205
She won't be intimidated.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.940
Okay, then I'll shoot
her and I'll go after

31:47.974 --> 31:49.475
whoever made
the damn bug for her.

31:49.508 --> 31:50.977
You're not going
to kill her.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.378
I said shoot, not kill.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.046
There are dozens
of microbiologists here.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.481
It would take days
to interrogate them.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.083
Tony doesn't have days.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.517
GIBBS:
Do you know where
her office is,

31:58.550 --> 31:59.718
or should I ask
the receptionist?

31:59.751 --> 32:02.188
Boss always has
the top floor office.

32:04.991 --> 32:07.293
Excuse me. Excuse me!

32:07.326 --> 32:08.660
You have to check in
with the receptionist.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.462
Do you have
an appointment?

32:10.496 --> 32:11.630
No. We have
a federal warrant.

32:11.663 --> 32:12.965
Security alert.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.000
Federal agents
coming up...

32:15.267 --> 32:17.269
They're here.
Okay.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.610
It's about time
you got here.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.746
I left enough cookie crumbs.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.249
You left more
than cookie crumbs, lady.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.383
I regret I resorted

32:31.417 --> 32:34.020
to such a dramatic act,

32:34.053 --> 32:35.754
but you people at NCIS
left me no choice

32:35.787 --> 32:38.224
when you lied
to protect the Academy.

32:38.257 --> 32:41.660
Now, you admit that
a midshipman raped my daughter

32:41.693 --> 32:44.130
and this will
all be over.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.297
The DNA testing cleared...

32:45.331 --> 32:46.265
Oh, stop it.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.067
I know how easy it is
to dope a DNA test.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.635
You love dramatic acts.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.203
They can be very effective.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.338
The effect
of this one

32:52.371 --> 32:54.240
is going to imprison you
for life.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.243
That long, hmm?

33:01.447 --> 33:03.482
You're dying.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.185
Rather rapidly.

33:06.218 --> 33:09.021
Which makes incarceration
highly unlikely.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.223
From the looks of it,
you want to protect

33:11.257 --> 33:13.559
just about every living thing
on the planet

33:13.592 --> 33:15.227
except for federal agents.

33:15.261 --> 33:19.598
My daughter never recovered
from the horror of that weekend.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.201
The truth will help her heal.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.403
Please, please give it to her.

33:26.238 --> 33:30.276
You won't get that antidote
until that midshipman...

33:30.309 --> 33:31.243
We don't need it.

33:31.277 --> 33:34.046
The Post Office went
postal on your plague.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.647
Zapped it right through
the lead SWAK.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.083
No one was infected.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.317
Oh, I don't believe you.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.451
I don't give a damn

33:39.485 --> 33:41.387
whether you believe
me or not.

33:41.420 --> 33:45.424
You are under arrest
for biological attack
on a federal agency.

33:45.457 --> 33:46.825
Take her
to interrogation.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.727
I'll wait here
for the task force
to arrest the others.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.062
You have the right
to remain silent.

33:50.096 --> 33:52.198
If you give up
that right...

33:52.231 --> 33:54.066
There are no others.
I acted alone.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.334
You are not a microbiologist.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.768
I stole the Y. pestis!

33:58.104 --> 34:00.606
Dr. Pandy doesn't even
know it's missing.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.409
Dr. Pandy.
What?

34:03.442 --> 34:06.112
Where's Dr. Pandy's lab?

34:06.145 --> 34:09.281
North wing, ground floor,
BL-Alpha.

34:09.315 --> 34:12.751
But you need authorization
to enter the North Wing.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.586
Someone was infected.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.822
I hope it was
Westmoreland.

34:16.855 --> 34:19.225
( coughing )

34:20.359 --> 34:21.393
Lay back, Tony.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.796
( coughing )

34:28.300 --> 34:30.636
All right,
everybody behind the shield.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.104
Tony, I'm going to need you

34:32.138 --> 34:33.572
to take a deep breath
and hold it.

34:33.605 --> 34:34.773
I don't think
I can, Brad.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.643
( coughing )

34:37.676 --> 34:40.512
Maybe Emma can do it for me.

34:40.546 --> 34:41.813
( chuckles )

34:41.847 --> 34:43.282
You have very healthy lungs,
Emma.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.384
Is he always like this?

34:45.417 --> 34:47.686
Unfortunately.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.588
Tony's humor
has always been

34:49.621 --> 34:52.558
sexist, juvenile,
raunchy.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.361
Funny.

34:55.394 --> 34:58.664
Sometimes can be funny.

34:58.697 --> 34:59.798
PANDY:
There is no antidote.

34:59.831 --> 35:03.369
I developed a vaccine,
not an antidote.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.537
It's of no use
once the victim
is infected.

35:05.571 --> 35:06.805
Hanna misunderstood.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.407
She understood.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.808
No, it's the brain tumor.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.143
That's what's killing her?

35:11.177 --> 35:12.378
It's inoperable,

35:12.411 --> 35:13.612
obviously affecting her mind.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.147
Why else would a woman
who fought

35:15.181 --> 35:16.448
to ban biological
weapons use them?

35:16.482 --> 35:17.316
I don't know.

35:17.349 --> 35:20.152
Why is Lowell Pharmaceutical
making them?

35:20.186 --> 35:21.287
We're not.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.689
You didn't create
this beast?

35:23.722 --> 35:25.191
Yes, but only
to develop

35:25.224 --> 35:26.458
a defense against it.

35:26.492 --> 35:29.828
Antibiotic-resistant diseases
are potential terrorist weapons.

35:29.861 --> 35:32.198
A terrorist isn't killing
my agent, you are!

35:32.231 --> 35:34.300
I understand your anger.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.235
No, you don't.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.869
But if you don't save him,
you will.

35:37.903 --> 35:41.173
It has a suicide chain
that stops it from replicating

35:41.207 --> 35:42.374
after 32 hours

35:42.408 --> 35:44.176
as a security precaution.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.944
It dies?
Yes.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.313
It's dead now?

35:47.346 --> 35:49.248
If it's over 32 hours

35:49.281 --> 35:51.683
since the specimen
has been infected,

35:51.717 --> 35:53.385
all the Y. pestis is dead.

35:53.419 --> 35:55.587
( decocks gun )

35:55.621 --> 35:56.622
However,

35:56.655 --> 35:58.490
the damage will have been done.

35:58.524 --> 36:01.260
The specimen is going to die?

36:01.293 --> 36:03.595
No. No, not necessarily.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.597
He has the same chance
of survival

36:05.631 --> 36:07.399
as those infected
in plagues of the past.

36:07.433 --> 36:08.434
Probably better

36:08.467 --> 36:10.336
since he would be healthy
and young.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.571
What was the survival
rate of the past?

36:12.604 --> 36:14.640
People were weakened
by depleted crops,

36:14.673 --> 36:16.308
bad nutrition.
Damn it!

36:16.342 --> 36:18.477
What was the
survival rate?!

36:18.510 --> 36:21.613
15%.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.351
( coughing )

36:25.384 --> 36:26.385
It looks like pneumonia.

36:26.418 --> 36:27.419
Worse, I'm afraid.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.754
Showing signs
of cyanosis.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.956
His fingernails
and lips are going blue.

36:30.989 --> 36:36.562
The Y. pestis is starving
his body of oxygen.

36:36.595 --> 36:39.498
It's too late
to reverse, isn't it?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.733
It's never too late.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.935
Until I get the body.

36:58.350 --> 37:01.520
I'm sorry I teased you
with all those movies, Kate.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.789
Teased?
You've tortured me.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.557
For two years
all I've heard

37:05.591 --> 37:08.360
is John Wayne
and Clint Eastwood,
James Bond.

37:08.394 --> 37:11.463
James Bond is a character...

37:11.497 --> 37:12.864
( coughs )

37:12.898 --> 37:15.401
...played by Sean Connery,
George Lazenby,

37:15.434 --> 37:19.371
Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan.

37:19.405 --> 37:20.706
( coughing )

37:22.574 --> 37:24.376
Why are you wearing the mask?

37:26.312 --> 37:28.647
'Cause I have a cold.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.551
Why aren't you sick?

37:32.584 --> 37:35.354
'Cause I'm stronger
than you, Tony.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.888
No, you're not.

37:36.922 --> 37:37.989
Am, too.

37:38.023 --> 37:41.593
( grunting )

37:41.627 --> 37:43.995
Tony, Tony, sit up.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.332
( gasping )

37:48.066 --> 37:50.436
PITT:
Kate, you should
leave-- now.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.504
( choking )

37:58.744 --> 38:00.946
Oh, God!

38:00.979 --> 38:04.383
( air lock hisses )

38:04.416 --> 38:05.717
( sobbing )

38:07.353 --> 38:09.321
You were brave
to stay with him, Kate.

38:09.355 --> 38:11.923
He's dying, Ducky!

38:11.957 --> 38:14.393
Ah, the hell he is.

38:16.562 --> 38:17.563
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who the hell are you?

38:17.596 --> 38:18.430
His boss.

38:18.464 --> 38:21.400
The bug had
a suicide gene.
It's dead.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.969
Been dead
for over an hour.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.405
He's no longer infectious.

38:32.578 --> 38:35.714
Tony, listen to me.

38:38.417 --> 38:41.920
You listening?

38:43.054 --> 38:46.892
I'm lis...
I'm listening, boss.

38:46.925 --> 38:53.064
You will not die,
you got that?

39:00.739 --> 39:02.374
I said,

39:02.408 --> 39:06.745
you will not die.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.718
I got you, boss.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.821
Good.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.825
Now...

39:22.661 --> 39:24.763
It's you new cell.

39:24.796 --> 39:29.134
I'd get the
number changed.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.102
Women keep calling
for "Spanky."

39:34.105 --> 39:36.508
You need to rest.

39:42.147 --> 39:45.551
WOMAN ( over P.A. ):
Dr. O'Dell, Orthorpedic, please.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.619
Dr. O'Dell, Orthorpedic.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.690
CASSIE:
Can you excuse me?

39:51.723 --> 39:54.059
How's Tony?

39:54.092 --> 39:55.894
Ah, he'll make it.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.095
What happened?

39:57.128 --> 39:58.497
Hanna lost it
in the car.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.632
Started rambling,
flashing peace signs.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.568
Once she bared her breasts
and shouted,

40:02.601 --> 40:04.703
"Make love, not war,"
I drove straight here.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.037
Sure it wasn't
an act?

40:06.071 --> 40:08.507
Her neurologist
says it's the tumor.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.307
He just left.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.176
He wants her released
into his care.

40:11.209 --> 40:13.111
Not likely.

40:13.144 --> 40:15.514
He can see her here
as much as he wants.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.715
That Sarah?

40:16.748 --> 40:18.517
Just as blank
as four years ago.

40:18.550 --> 40:22.187
Sarah, this is
Special Agent Gibbs.

40:22.220 --> 40:25.557
I am so sorry.

40:25.591 --> 40:29.861
I can't believe
my mother did this.

40:29.895 --> 40:34.833
I knew someday Mother
would do something terrible.

40:37.235 --> 40:40.138
I told her,
but she wouldn't believe me.

40:40.171 --> 40:42.708
Told her?

40:42.741 --> 40:45.076
That it wasn't a midshipman.

40:46.645 --> 40:49.548
So, you remember
who assaulted you?

40:51.550 --> 40:52.618
No.

40:52.651 --> 40:56.254
How do you know
it wasn't a midshipman?

40:56.287 --> 40:59.625
I heard they were all cleared.

41:03.529 --> 41:05.230
Are you sure
you don't remember?

41:08.199 --> 41:09.635
Yes.

41:12.838 --> 41:16.007
You know who raped you,
don't you, Sarah?

41:20.679 --> 41:22.047
Sarah?

41:22.080 --> 41:24.616
( sobbing )

41:29.855 --> 41:31.823
I wasn't raped.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.828
We all thought it was funny...

41:36.862 --> 41:39.631
tying me to the bed.

41:39.665 --> 41:43.935
I had said that the midshipmen
looked cute in their uniform.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.904
I was kidding!

41:45.937 --> 41:47.706
And so when he went out

41:47.739 --> 41:50.141
to get us some burgers
and shakes,

41:50.175 --> 41:52.077
he tied me up.

41:52.110 --> 41:54.279
Nobody's going
to disturb you.

41:54.312 --> 41:55.380
Oh, help!

41:55.413 --> 41:58.984
So that way, I wouldn't run off
with one of them.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.553
It was just a joke.

42:01.587 --> 42:07.092
And then when
he didn't come back,

42:07.125 --> 42:09.060
I started going crazy.

42:09.094 --> 42:11.196
First worrying
about why,

42:11.229 --> 42:14.933
and then, and then...

42:14.966 --> 42:17.603
being found.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.671
CASSIE:
What happened to him?

42:21.607 --> 42:24.710
He was killed
by a hit-and-run driver

42:24.743 --> 42:26.812
crossing the road.

42:26.845 --> 42:29.715
Why did you say
you were raped?

42:29.748 --> 42:33.218
I was tied naked to a bed.

42:33.251 --> 42:37.188
What else could I tell
my mother?

42:47.365 --> 42:50.335
Can I sleep here?

42:50.368 --> 42:52.337
As long as you don't give
Tony that cold.

42:57.776 --> 42:58.844
He's asleep.

42:58.877 --> 43:00.679
Thank you.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.044
This reminds me
of the end of Alien.

43:33.078 --> 43:39.651
( chuckling )
