After Gae sex, there is no other sex.
Are you happy?

17:02.940 --> 17:05.609
‐ But Gae sex was different
than all the other sex you'd had then?

17:05.609 --> 17:07.736
‐ Gae sex is the best of all sex.

17:08.529 --> 17:09.780
And I miss it.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.615
‐ Would you go as far as to say
Gae sex was

17:11.615 --> 17:13.534
kind of your own personal awakening?

17:13.534 --> 17:15.577
‐ Gae sex made me feel something deep.

17:17.621 --> 17:18.705
Deep inside of me.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.416
There, I said it!

17:21.416 --> 17:23.043
It's as though my whole life
was meaningless

17:23.043 --> 17:24.127
before I discovered Gae sex.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.462
Are you satisfied?
‐ Stewart.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.673
‐ Gae sex made me feel pride.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.466
Gae sex made me feel like He‐Man.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.469
Must you torture me
with these reflections?

17:33.637 --> 17:37.182
Ever since she left,
all I think about is Gae sex.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.894
I dream about it.
‐ Life altering then, eh?

17:40.894 --> 17:42.312
‐ Earth shattering.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.981
‐ Earth‐shattering Gae sex.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.984
‐ You know, Stewart,
just because this Gae got away

17:46.984 --> 17:50.404
doesn't mean that there aren't
a lot of other Gae's out there.

17:50.404 --> 17:52.281
‐ Almost certainly.
‐ Find yourself a Gae.

17:53.282 --> 17:54.408
Then you'll know what I mean.

17:54.992 --> 17:55.951
‐ Okay.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.078
‐ Stewart.
‐ Roald.

17:59.037 --> 18:02.624
‐ Are you done talking about sex
with your ex‐girlfriend

18:02.624 --> 18:04.835
who happens to be named Gae?

18:04.835 --> 18:07.254
STEWART:
I don't even know anymore.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.548
‐ Because we've watched
a lot of porn today.

18:09.548 --> 18:13.177
But we haven't watched any gay porn,

18:13.177 --> 18:14.511
so I was thinking...
DARYL: Uh, Roald,

18:14.511 --> 18:16.722
we're all for you
living your best life, but...

18:16.722 --> 18:19.099
‐ All for you tastin' the rainbow,
bud, but...

18:19.099 --> 18:21.226
‐ All for you living your life largely,

18:21.226 --> 18:22.394
but...
‐ In.

18:22.394 --> 18:23.937
‐ Wanna watch a movie?
‐ 'Kay.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.772
‐ You wanna play a game of Crib?
‐ 'Kay.

18:29.359 --> 18:30.736
‐ Stewart?

18:30.736 --> 18:32.321
‐ All of this Gae sex talk.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.239
I'm defeated.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.241
‐ Rips?

18:37.326 --> 18:38.744
‐ Absolutely.

18:38.744 --> 18:40.913
‐ See you and your
big fuckin' dick later.

18:41.622 --> 18:42.706
‐ What's up, schmelt?

18:42.706 --> 18:44.208
‐ Sup, phezzy?
‐ Boys.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.043
‐ Wait, you're on a team this year?

18:46.043 --> 18:48.003
‐ Yeah. Got picked up
by a senior triple‐A team

18:48.003 --> 18:49.588
in the city after the Irish folded.

18:49.588 --> 18:51.131
‐ You?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.175
‐ How the fuck are you on a team
and we're not?

18:53.175 --> 18:56.345
‐ I dunno. May wanna
get on that though 'cause

18:56.345 --> 18:58.096
girls love hockey players, boys.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.312
‐ Point and proof. Chins up.
I'll buy you a beer.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.899
BOTH:
Oh. Bonnie McMurray.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.034
‐ Feeling a little better
about what turns you on

19:19.034 --> 19:20.536
after hours, big fella?

19:21.078 --> 19:22.371
‐ I am, Gailer.

19:22.371 --> 19:24.373
I've realized that whats we watch
in our mes time

19:24.373 --> 19:26.333
is no one's business
but our ownsen

19:26.333 --> 19:28.293
and nots to be agreed upon
by everybodys.

19:28.293 --> 19:31.463
‐ No place for the state
in the bedrooms of the nation.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.632
‐ Trudeau?
‐ True dat.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.259
To each his or her own, cowboy.

19:39.638 --> 19:41.056
You wanna get that nut?

19:42.599 --> 19:43.851
White boy.

19:43.851 --> 19:47.980
[man and woman moaning]

19:59.741 --> 20:02.119
[moaning continues]

20:12.296 --> 20:14.673
[moaning continues]

20:28.729 --> 20:30.856
[moaning continues]
