WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:04.036
Man on tv: Take that,
you vampire scum!

00:04.105 --> 00:06.171
Wait. Is this how I got
my middle name?

00:06.173 --> 00:07.539
What?

00:07.575 --> 00:10.376
Okay. Yes, but blade
is a cool name.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.510
Are you mad?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.846
Not even a little.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.013
(singing heroic fanfare)

00:15.016 --> 00:17.249
(both shouting)

00:17.318 --> 00:18.517
Woman on tv:
Ally baxter!

00:18.586 --> 00:19.784
Where did "leo" come from?

00:19.820 --> 00:22.721
Well, your dad and I each chose
one of your names.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.656
And you were born in August,
so I named you leo.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.526
- My little lion.
- Cool.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.560
What about me?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.095
Oh. Well, you know
your middle name

00:30.231 --> 00:32.064
Came from your nani ji. Aarti.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.132
Actually...

00:34.168 --> 00:35.600
(clearing throat)

00:35.669 --> 00:38.403
...Check out this baby name
book.

00:40.941 --> 00:44.409
"khia. Baby girl.
Eldest sister." aww.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.878
"strong, beautiful warrior."

00:46.013 --> 00:47.079
Camille:
Oh.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.746
Looks like it pays
to be born first.

00:48.783 --> 00:49.747
Sorry, bud.

00:52.053 --> 00:56.154
Wait. This says you bought this
two months after I was born.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.823
Dad?

00:57.825 --> 00:59.157
Okay. Fine.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.693
When your mom and I
first started dating,

01:01.829 --> 01:02.828
I had this car.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.164
You named me after a car?

01:05.166 --> 01:08.300
Not just any car.
The car you were conceived in.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.102
Andrew & camille:
Hey!

01:11.138 --> 01:12.504
Sorry, bud.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.378
Ramesh:
It's equidistant

01:20.414 --> 01:22.848
Between camille's house,
the grocery, and bubble bae.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.649
I mean,
what more could you want?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.851
We're not moving
across the street

01:26.887 --> 01:28.453
From your old house, ramesh.
Here.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.988
Take a look at this.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.424
It's in the middle of nowhere!

01:32.426 --> 01:34.259
I've always dreamed of living
in the country,

01:34.261 --> 01:36.795
Where I can make my own rules.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.130
Barb, I sold my house for you,

01:38.265 --> 01:40.532
But I do draw the line
at becoming a bumpkin.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.068
This is just like the suburbs,
only with more space.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.869
It's just like?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.507
I will show you how similar
they are.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.442
Where are you--

01:50.511 --> 01:52.544
Ramesh isn't great with change.
Don't take it personal.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.013
Oh, I know.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.883
Zero intimacy since his house
went into escrow.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.984
Ah. Huh.
How's it going with you two?

02:00.020 --> 02:03.355
(sighing)
your cousin wants to rent.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.389
Oh, no.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.824
Our mom forbid renting.

02:06.861 --> 02:08.860
(imitating his mom) "andrew, you
rent, you die broke and alone."

02:08.929 --> 02:11.563
I like renting.
Don't have to fix anything.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.032
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're getting married in a month

02:14.068 --> 02:16.435
And I'm finding out now
that you can't fix anything?

02:16.437 --> 02:19.771
Rent, buy. Whichever, you're
living the downtown dream.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.446

02:27.581 --> 02:30.081

Well,
you guys are just so in sync.

02:37.925 --> 02:41.126
That's becau...

02:42.863 --> 02:44.028
- Should we--
- ah, just wait for it.

02:44.064 --> 02:48.199
...Ause of this.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.401
Nsync wrote a self-help book?

02:49.470 --> 02:51.469
Technically, it was written by
their roadie.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.471
But he was on tour.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.741
Did you know they would sing
their arguments to each other?

02:55.743 --> 02:57.609
That can't be true.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.478
Babe, what are you mad about?

03:00.514 --> 03:04.616

get ready to say,

03:18.199 --> 03:22.033
'bye-bye-bye." jc chasez.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.268
- Can I, uh--
- yeah.

03:23.403 --> 03:26.371
You two will work it out.
It just takes some time.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.106
You know, we wanted different
places at first, too.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.174
Uh-huh.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.577
Well, how'd you figure it out?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.979
Well, it was 13 years ago.

03:34.048 --> 03:37.115
The summer was hot,
but not too humid.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.184
I fell in love with camille
five years earlier,

03:40.221 --> 03:42.587
But finding our forever house
together

03:42.656 --> 03:44.890
Made me fall in love with her
all over again.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.725
Camille, are you seeing this?

03:48.796 --> 03:50.195
Camille was pregnant with leo.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.197
She had the hair
of julia roberts

03:52.332 --> 03:55.067
And the fashion sense
of super mario.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.468
She was a glowing goddess.

03:56.537 --> 04:00.739
We were so in love.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.907
You know, houses really
don't open up

04:02.943 --> 04:04.409
In this neighbourhood often.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.745
Hmm. Why'd they move?

04:06.747 --> 04:07.845
They died.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.481
Oh.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.782
Mid-renovation,
if you can believe it.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.818
(laughing) that's why the price
is so low.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.154
Oh, you feel that, babe?
Butterflies!

04:16.223 --> 04:18.123
- (whispering) ghosts.
- Realtor: Have a look around.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.959
Gabriela prowse.
I'm-a put you in a house.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.629
Babe, look at this space!

04:24.698 --> 04:26.030
Andrew (in present):
I saw it all.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.632
The kids playing
in the sprinklers.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.934
The barbecues with friends.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.303
I knew then that this was
the perfect house.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.970
Camille (in present):
You're forgetting the part

04:33.007 --> 04:35.674
Where you wiped out.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.109
Oh. Andrew, are you okay?

04:38.178 --> 04:40.846
Why did they put this fireplace
right in the middle of the--

04:40.848 --> 04:43.181
It's perfect.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.217
Barb:
Sounds like you knew right away.

04:45.352 --> 04:48.986
He did.
I wanted this condo downtown.

04:49.023 --> 04:52.391
Oh. Five minutes from work.
Perfect walking distance

04:52.526 --> 04:54.126
To all the cool shops
and the restaurants.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.060
And within our budget.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.663
Same price, but tiny.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.799
And they sold it
before we could make an offer,

05:00.868 --> 05:03.468
So who needs cool when
you've got chain restaurants

05:03.470 --> 05:05.637
And outlet malls?

05:05.772 --> 05:07.606
Well, it definitely wasn't
the rockridge value plaza

05:07.608 --> 05:08.673
That convinced me.

05:08.676 --> 05:09.641
Andrew:
Well, exactly.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.944
- It was the house.
- What? No.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.012
The yard?

05:14.081 --> 05:15.680
(scoffing)

05:15.683 --> 05:16.682
(gasping) oh, my god!

05:16.817 --> 05:18.216
This place is perfect!
Come here.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.020
Does it give you butterflies?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.823
- Wow. Look at that bathroom.
- Look at that sneaker closet.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.191
- Hey, everyone.
- Carol: It's a normal closet.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.458
Leo:
Hello?

05:27.494 --> 05:28.826
Every closet's a sneaker closet
if you believe.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.061
Hello?

05:30.130 --> 05:32.096
Hey, sweetie. Just grab a snack.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.165
- Oh!
- Look at those alcor cushions!

05:34.234 --> 05:36.568
(adults chattering indistinctly)

05:36.570 --> 05:39.137
Cathy's mom: Did you hear what
I said? Are you even listening?

05:39.272 --> 05:40.639
Khia:
How's the house-hunting going?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.841
Ramesh:
Terrible.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.109
But all that is about to change.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.310
Now, if you can seal these up
for me,

05:45.312 --> 05:46.511
I'll be on my way.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.579
The sealer's broken.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.114
Can you wait a minute?

05:49.183 --> 05:52.050
Khia, time is of the essence.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.119
Cathy: I tried that already.
It's melting the cups.

05:54.188 --> 05:57.656
Cathy's mom:
Try it again. Hit it.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.795
Cathy's mom:
I told you.

06:03.831 --> 06:04.996
- How did you know that worked?
- I'm your mother.

06:04.998 --> 06:05.963
I know everything.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.533
Okay. Well, I got to go.

06:08.668 --> 06:10.402
Tell dad to stop sending
pictures of his foot

06:10.471 --> 06:12.671
In the group chat
and just go see a doctor.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.906
Cathy's mom: Yes, yes.
I see you Sunday, sin wing.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.341
Bye.

06:16.476 --> 06:17.909
What does "sin wing" mean?

06:19.480 --> 06:21.146
It's my name.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.081
Okay. Why don't you go by
sin wing? It's beautiful.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.017
Yeah. I go by both.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.552
No. I mean... (melodically)
...Sin wing! (flatly) cathy.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.089
I'm going to go do inventory,
and you cover the counter.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.156
Okay, sin wing.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.760
Okay. Great.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.366
So, $2,000 a month for condo
fees on top of the mortgage,

06:41.435 --> 06:44.903
And the bedroom doesn't even
have walls?

06:44.972 --> 06:47.438
Babe,
that's the charm of a loft.

06:47.474 --> 06:50.041
Andrew: Or maybe you could get
a two-bedroom,

06:50.177 --> 06:51.509
Just in case you ever--

06:51.645 --> 06:52.844
We're not having kids.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.047
So, this is how I find out
I'm never going to be an uncle?

06:56.183 --> 06:58.784
Nikhil: So, what convinced you
to buy this place in the end?

06:58.919 --> 07:03.321
Well, it was
a cool autumn afternoon,

07:03.390 --> 07:07.058
But the humidity
was off the charts.

07:07.060 --> 07:11.196
The last thing I wanted to do
was stay in the burbs,

07:11.265 --> 07:14.132
But I had a serious craving for

07:14.201 --> 07:17.335
Those chocolatey
open-house cookies, you know?

07:17.471 --> 07:20.805
And good realtors like gabriela,
well, she bakes them fresh.

07:20.874 --> 07:24.075
- (doorbell ringing)
- it's perfect.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.944
Ramesh:
The doorbell's a little stiff.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.080
Andrew:
Khia! There's my baby girl.

07:29.216 --> 07:32.551
Ah. Let's go see
the backyard, huh?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.219
(khia giggling)

07:34.288 --> 07:37.421
You know, khia told me
that she wants to stay

07:37.458 --> 07:38.556
Living with her nana ji.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.025
- No, she doesn't.
- She did not.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.694
But she could've.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.796
Andrew moved in with me
when we got pregnant with khia.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.832
Andrew fell in love with
the burbs,

07:47.835 --> 07:51.436
And my dad fell in love with
us living with him.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.872
Dad, we need our own space.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.240
Well, if you're
absolutely certain,

07:56.276 --> 07:58.175
I suppose I could get you
a new doorbell.

07:58.212 --> 08:00.912
Or you could learn to use
the subway downtown,

08:01.047 --> 08:03.381
Because that is where I'll be.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.251
Don't be ridiculous. This is
five minutes from my house.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.552
It's perfect for me.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.988
Ramesh (in present):
Camille, I need a bandage.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.356
Oh, my god, dad. What happened?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.591
Best not to look, barb.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.060
(heaving)
blood gives me the dry heaves!

08:16.096 --> 08:18.296
- Barb: I just--
- what's with the cups?

08:18.431 --> 08:21.466
Yes. Well,
I went to get us all drinks,

08:21.601 --> 08:22.667
To show barb the lunacy

08:22.669 --> 08:24.636
Of living an hour out
in the country.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.738
There's no bubble bae
in bumpkinville.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.341
But the cup sealer
wasn't working,

08:30.410 --> 08:31.676
And then I tripped over
a bloody curb.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.377
You mean you did all this stuff
just to convince me

08:33.413 --> 08:34.812
That we should stay
in this neighbourhood?

08:34.882 --> 08:36.815
Well, yes.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.684
Bubble bae and my family.
What more could you want?

08:39.819 --> 08:41.686
(sighing)

08:45.659 --> 08:46.825
(heaving)

08:46.827 --> 08:49.093
(thudding)

08:53.100 --> 08:55.433
Andrew:
Ah, sick. Does it hurt?

08:55.435 --> 08:56.635
Yes.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.036
Dad, you really have to be
more careful.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.239
Well, it's a good thing that you
don't live out in the country,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.240
Or I would've bled to death.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.644
Okay. So, what happened next?

09:05.646 --> 09:06.678
Oh. We were telling the story

09:06.813 --> 09:07.979
Of how we ended up with
this place.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.514
Ah, yes.
You're welcome for that.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.183
For what?

09:12.319 --> 09:13.718
Well, you bought this house
because of me.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.953
That's not true.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.722
Yes. I remember it vividly.
The spring

09:17.857 --> 09:19.524
Was stiflingly hot.

09:19.659 --> 09:22.193
Torrid, even.

09:22.195 --> 09:26.130
(man singing in
foreign language)

09:27.701 --> 09:29.801
Camille (in present):
Dad, this was 13 years ago.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.469
You didn't have hair.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.472
Ramesh (in present):
I'll tell my story how I want.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.441
(man continues singing in
foreign language)

09:39.012 --> 09:40.545
Sturdy bones.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.647
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.619
Ah. I know all about
house construction.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.423
Wait! Everybody get back.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.227
Robber:
Everybody be cool.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.162
Wallets and jewellery
in the bag.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.631
- (camille whimpering)
- robber: Now!

09:59.633 --> 10:00.798
Not on my watch.

10:01.868 --> 10:05.270
(shouting)

10:05.405 --> 10:06.470
(thudding)

10:06.506 --> 10:08.640
Wow, dad!

10:08.775 --> 10:09.774
You're my hero.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.413
- Yeah. That didn't happen.
- Ramesh: What?

10:15.548 --> 10:16.847
Some of the details
are a little foggy,

10:16.883 --> 10:18.183
But yeah, I think that's it.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.719
- (laughing)
- no. There was no robber there.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.320
Camille left
and the realtor came back in.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.589
Ah.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.190
Yes.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.193
It's all coming back to me now.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.495
Well, I need some air.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.465
For pregnancy reasons.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.799
Camille (in present):
Pregnancy reasons?

10:34.868 --> 10:36.201
No. I was just tired of you two
pushing on things

10:36.336 --> 10:37.736
And talking about sturdy bones.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.270
Ramesh (in present):
Then, your realtor came in.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.873
Ramesh!

10:42.943 --> 10:46.211
You're so handsome.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.945
Oh, gabriela,
I'm but a humble man

10:47.981 --> 10:51.082
Who is only exactly as handsome
as you say.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.084
(giggling)

10:53.086 --> 10:54.752
Good news, andrew.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.354
The deal fell through
on that condo we liked,

10:56.356 --> 10:58.957
And it's back on the market.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.892
- Shall we make an offer?
- Certainly not.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.162
We'll take this one.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.964
(gabriela gasping, giggling)

11:07.801 --> 11:09.834
And that was that.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.570
My dream condo
was back on the market?

11:14.441 --> 11:15.707
Andrew:
Um--

11:15.776 --> 11:18.343
Hey, babe! Let's watch leo.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.181
Good job, buddy.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.984
Well, how could you not tell me?

11:25.986 --> 11:27.685
I wanted to.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.288
Andrew:
It's not--

11:30.290 --> 11:32.056
(sighing) am I not cute anymore?

11:32.092 --> 11:33.424
But the thing--

11:34.928 --> 11:37.661
Okay. What do you think of
"anamika"?

11:37.698 --> 11:39.264
It means "a nameless person."

11:39.266 --> 11:41.065
You want your name to mean
you have no name?

11:43.270 --> 11:44.268
Kobe.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.840
What's this?

11:48.975 --> 11:49.808
Francis:
Hey, cathy.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.776
Are you adding hot wings
to the menu?

11:51.778 --> 11:53.411
No. Sin wing
is cathy's real name.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.745
Hmm.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.347
Khia: It's so customers know
who's working.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.749
I'm still trying to find
a new name for my cup,

11:57.818 --> 11:59.718
But it's cute, right?

11:59.853 --> 12:02.086
Yeah. So, no hot wings, then?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.721
Mm-mmm.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.225
Camille:
What is the one thing

12:08.261 --> 12:10.028
I told you I wanted in a house?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.496
- Love?
- Open concept.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.833
I mean, guess how many fires
we've had since we moved in.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.434
- Seven.
- Zero.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.635
I hate that fireplace.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.136
You know, I hate the moulding.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.906

13:15.395 --> 13:16.627
Hey, but why did you stop using
sin wing?

13:16.663 --> 13:19.631
I didn't.
But when I went to kindergarten,

13:19.766 --> 13:23.968
The kids started calling me
sin wing the chicken wing.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.436
No. I'm as funny as
a kindergartener.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.005
No. Okay.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.306
All right.
I'll work on my sin wing digs.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.742
Please don't.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.710
I cried so much,
my parents changed it to cathy

13:32.746 --> 13:34.245
For the rest of the world.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.113
Oh. Well, you are the wind

13:36.149 --> 13:38.716
Beneath my sin wing. (chuckling)

13:38.852 --> 13:43.721
Okay. In all seriousness,
khia looks up to you.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.090
And cathy or sin wing,
that's your choice,

13:46.092 --> 13:48.492
But maybe it would help
if she understands why.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.530
It ain't no thing
but a sin wing!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.066
(chuckling) someone stop me.
I can't stop myself.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.967

17:17.136 --> 17:19.270
Right. Why would you change it?

Never.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.389
(toddlers babbling)

19:20.393 --> 19:21.726
Let's put in an offer.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.794
Babe, don't tease me.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.397
No. I--
I think I want to live here.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.200
Hudson:
Awesome! Are you a hugger?

19:29.202 --> 19:31.202
Oh, bring it in, neighbour!

19:31.204 --> 19:33.003
(both laughing)

19:33.072 --> 19:34.538
- Andrew: That's nice!
- Hudson: Yeah.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.007
Andrew: Cool.
You have a nice little grip.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.041
Hudson: Ooh, man.
That felt really warm.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.576
It's in the water!

19:38.645 --> 19:40.110
Aw.

19:40.146 --> 19:43.347
Khia made a friend,
and I saw everything.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.148

20:11.978 --> 20:13.110
(sighing)

20:13.112 --> 20:15.713
And dad, I'm so sorry
to hear about barb.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.581
Just so you know,

20:17.617 --> 20:19.250
It has been really nice
living so close to you.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.386
Well, I'm actually grateful
to hear you say that,

20:22.388 --> 20:25.289
Because andrew mentioned that
I could move into the basement

20:25.424 --> 20:27.858
While the house stuff
is being sorted out.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.393
Andrew said what now?

20:29.462 --> 20:31.261
(scatting)

20:31.297 --> 20:33.130

20:33.132 --> 20:34.198
No.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.801
(beat-boxing)

20:36.936 --> 20:41.272
(beat-boxing continues)

20:46.812 --> 20:48.612
What's up with you?

20:48.615 --> 20:51.082
I don't think I'm cute anymore.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.349
What are you talking about?

20:52.385 --> 20:54.418
Everyone ignored me all day.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.887
Leo, mom and dad
are never going to ignore you,

20:56.923 --> 20:58.556
Whether you want them to
or not.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.690
You weren't there.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.458
It was rough.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.896
Mom, dad? Leo had a bad day.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.364
What are you doing?

21:09.835 --> 21:11.569
My baby boy!

21:11.571 --> 21:12.670
Camille:
Who hurt you?

21:12.805 --> 21:15.773
I will cut them, honey.
I'll cut them.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.708
Khia, help me!

21:17.710 --> 21:19.443
Sorry, bud.

21:19.578 --> 21:20.778
What did they do?

21:20.913 --> 21:21.979
Tell mom.
Tell mom all the details.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.113
Oh, what did they do to you?

21:23.149 --> 21:25.716
