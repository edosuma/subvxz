00:04.630 --> 00:05.846
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.006 --> 00:08.259
Ghost ain't here.
He don't exist!

00:08.425 --> 00:11.725
I'm number one now. I'm gonna get you
the best product at the best price.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.639
Lobos was stabbed in custody.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.900
And everything we ever wanted
can happen now.

00:17.059 --> 00:19.983
- What's our new hustle?
- The club is the new hustle.

00:22.842 --> 00:25.042
Shipment was light.
The other primeras might get pissed.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.252
Can you think of a reason why Lobos
wouldn't send the full amount?

00:27.277 --> 00:28.877
We have to make it look like
you're dead.

00:29.043 --> 00:31.283
If your money's moving,
it means you're alive to move it.

00:31.308 --> 00:32.995
- Felipe Lobos is alive.
- What?

00:33.158 --> 00:34.478
He survived the attack in prison.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.336
Tommy, we need to talk, man.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.623
Tomas, did you forget our deal?

00:38.789 --> 00:41.008
Ghost needs to be dead soon.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.964
- Otherwise...
- Holly?

00:43.126 --> 00:46.130

they won't be safe.

What is so important that
we couldn't discuss on the phone?

03:17.656 --> 03:19.829
I need you to get a message
to our friend Lobos.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.370
Word on the street is Lobos died
from gettin' stabbed in the slammer.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.335
I heard he got stabbed.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.249
I didn't hear
he actually kicked, though.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.544
You looking for confirmation?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.680
I'm looking for a location.
Have a seat.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.717
- You want a drink?
- No, I'm good.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.107
I need to know where he is.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.651
I know you got
connections, Proctor,

03:46.810 --> 03:49.290
and I know you can use those
connections to get me what I need.

03:49.315 --> 03:52.195
Yes, I can...

03:52.357 --> 03:54.109
but the question is
whether I should.

03:54.276 --> 03:57.280
See, you asking means
you already know more than I do.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.448
You're not exposed right now.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.207
Keep it that way.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.040
Yeah, but when this is all over,
I'm done for good.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.250
I no longer need you.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.541
L just got to make sure it's over.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.927
You know, it's too bad you can't ask
your ex-girlfriend, the prosecutor,

04:12.085 --> 04:13.758
'cause she would know
where to find him.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.218
Actually,
Angela and I are still together.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.803
Oh, man.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.166
You got to teach me whatever it is
you know about women,

04:20.302 --> 04:23.397
because she should hate
your breathing guts by now.

04:24.890 --> 04:29.396
And she would if I keep going
to her for information.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.982
That's why I need you.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.487
I think we could actually be successful
with this John Doe prosecution of Lobos

04:38.653 --> 04:40.155
even without a witness against him,

04:40.322 --> 04:42.722
but there's no way we can do it
without bringing in the files

04:42.747 --> 04:44.918
- from Texas and California.
- I don't know, Angela.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.996
Involving the other states could open
us up to forum shopping for Kessler.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.748
He could request a change of venue.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.758
We make the argument
that he was arrested here.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.464
We have the strongest case.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.927
I want to review the files from the other
jurisdictions and talk to their agents.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.931
Why don't I get those files for you?

04:59.090 --> 05:01.013
The request can be filled faster
if I make it,

05:01.176 --> 05:03.270
- especially by my former office.
- Great.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.357
- Saxe, what's up?
- Was that Angela?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.413
What did she want that she had
to come to you on the sly,

05:13.438 --> 05:15.031
she couldn't share
with the group?

05:15.190 --> 05:16.442
Why are you here?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.328
You don't seem to be sharing
with the group.

05:18.353 --> 05:20.662
I had an idea.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.501
We told Judge Cross that we would
solve the attempt on Lobos's life.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.663
Maybe we should.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.579
Yeah, I said that,
but there's nothing to solve.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.122
We know it was the Jimenez.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.168
The identity of the hitter
doesn't really matter

05:32.335 --> 05:33.895
since he's clearly
already incarcerated.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.795
But if we prove
it was the Jimenez,

05:35.961 --> 05:38.259
we can potentially add that murder
to the list of charges

05:38.421 --> 05:41.971
when we eventually bring
Diego Jimenez to trial, right?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.976
Got to land
the big whale sometime.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.137
Do I have your blessing?

05:46.304 --> 05:49.649
Yeah, go for it,
but I doubt you'll find the guy.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.560
It's probably a waste of your time.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.059
Tommy, we need to talk, man.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.358
It's Ghost.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.120
Who was on the phone?

06:52.287 --> 06:54.130
They had the wrong number.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.882
Flyers look good.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.214
I bet we get a call, find Bell.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.549
L just hope she's not hurt.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.720
Look, Holl, if we don't find her,

07:04.883 --> 07:06.885
I promise I'll get you another one.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.225
You can't just replace Bell.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.435
That's like saying if you died,

07:11.598 --> 07:13.726
I'm just gonna go out
and fuck another guy right away.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.894
Jesus, Holly,
that's a fucked-up thing to say.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.734
That's my point.

07:17.896 --> 07:21.992
Look, I want Bell
just like I only want you.

07:22.901 --> 07:26.656
I want Bell, and I'm not gonna be
able to sleep until we find her.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.500
I'm sure we'll find her.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.176
Thanks for letting me
take the kids to Angela's.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.836
I didn't do it for you.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.673
You know, when my dad left,
I hardly saw him at all.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.637
They deserve better.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.552
Why are you really here?

07:50.929 --> 07:53.432
I need you to get this check
to Tommy.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.486
You sure we can afford this

07:58.645 --> 08:01.273
now that you only have
club money coming in?

08:01.439 --> 08:03.487
It's not our money, Tasha.
It's Tommy's.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.994
Closed the laundromats,
all the original Truth accounts.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.371
It's his half of everything,
all the businesses.

08:09.572 --> 08:13.167
After Tommy gets this check,
we're officially closed for business.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.794
I'm out.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.921
We are not partners anymore.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.312
Why don't you tell him
that yourself?

08:19.457 --> 08:21.004
Because he won't return
my calls, okay?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.795
- He don't want to see me.
- Well, he doesn't want to see me.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.932
Looks like I'm collateral damage
in whatever happened between y'all.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.769
Can you just reach out
to Tommy for me?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.272
Today.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.563
Did you hear from Lobos
about why we keep getting

08:37.726 --> 08:38.926
half the motherfucking weight?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.379
Look, Lobos is stuck in the joint,

08:40.477 --> 08:42.121
and we selling the story
that he dead in the streets,

08:42.147 --> 08:43.707
so motherfucker got problems,
all right?

08:43.815 --> 08:46.989
Probably had to scale down his moves
for a minute while he plays dead,

08:47.152 --> 08:48.995
- so slow your roll, man.
- All right.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.214
What am I gonna tell our new
primera friends when we can't deliver

08:51.239 --> 08:53.583
the amount of fuckin' weight
we promised them, Tommy?

08:53.742 --> 08:57.246
Yo, maybe

08:57.412 --> 09:01.087
we should step on the product,
cut it up, right?

09:01.249 --> 09:03.143
- Make everybody fucking happy.
- We ain't doing that.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.011
- Why not?
- The move is short-minded, man.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.610
I'm not gonna compromise
the product.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.348
That would ruin
my name in the street.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.180
Change of management
doesn't mean change in product.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.902
- Then what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.021
Why don't you fucking let me think?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.363
How long have you
been back in town?

09:31.529 --> 09:34.032
Long enough to know that
you're not welcome here.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.998
Look, Tommy doesn't want
to talk to you or Ghost.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.998
I think he'll change his mind
when we talk about money.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.714
Not so fast.
Your name ain't on this check.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.469
How much is that for?

09:46.628 --> 09:50.132
You'll find out when you
tell Tommy to come see me.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.347
He knows my number.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.648
We both work for Lobos.
We're on the same side.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.559
I'm looking for your help here.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.228
If we knew the name of the man
who stabbed Lobos,

10:03.394 --> 10:05.567
- he'd already be dead.
- Well, he's not.

10:05.730 --> 10:09.075
And if somebody else finds him before
we do, Lobos could have a problem.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.078
We let everyone believe it's the Jimenez
so there aren't any loose ends,

10:12.237 --> 10:14.615
but if the hitter fingers Ghost,
then Ghost can turn witness

10:14.781 --> 10:16.499
and testify against Lobos.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.660
Trust me, if that happens...

10:52.527 --> 10:53.619
No! No, no, no.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.046
Fuck that.

11:11.212 --> 11:15.183
My kids are not spending the night
over at no side piece's house, ever.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.969
- That bitch is a drive-by.
- She ain't a drive-by.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.638
He parked.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.085
And if I act badly,
the kids are the only ones who suffer.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.519
- You're being way too nice.
- I'm being an adult, Keisha.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.605
Trust me, if it wasn't for them kids,
I'd throw the bitch down the stairs.

11:28.630 --> 11:30.736
You the right amount of wrong,

11:30.899 --> 11:34.324
or you could punch that bitch
in the throat with that big-ass ring of...

11:34.485 --> 11:35.828
Tasha, where your ring at?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.908
Do not tell me he asked you
to give that shit back.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.997
He wouldn't try it.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.204
It's worth more to me gone.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.419
You sold it? You that pressed?

11:47.582 --> 11:50.506
I'm not pressed for money, not yet.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.763
I'm just... I'm over it, Keisha.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.050
I'm not playing make-believe
with Ghost anymore.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.763
The Ghost I knew is gone.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.054
Well, look,

12:00.220 --> 12:01.847
if you ever need some extra cash,

12:02.013 --> 12:03.933
you could always do the books
around here for me.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.519
I know you always
got my back, girl,

12:07.685 --> 12:10.905
and I appreciate that,
but I'm good.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.904
I'll let you know, though,
if anything changes.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.025
I might need you.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.615
All right, well, I'ma go finish
this weave real quick.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.123
- Yeah, help her out.
- Stop.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.547
Got some big spenders over there...

12:31.709 --> 12:33.461
Four bottles of Effen,
and it's still early.

12:33.628 --> 12:34.880
My kind of people.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.924
Hey, here they are.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.310
I'm James St. Patrick,
the club owner.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.390
Hey, bae, hold my piece.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.103
- Andy. This is Alby.
- Andy.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.627
- Hey, Alby, pleasure.
- Hey, great place you got here, bro.

12:49.652 --> 12:51.562
Thanks, man.
You know, we... we try.

12:51.654 --> 12:54.374
- Well, we love it. Don't we love it?
- Love it. Yeah, we'll be back.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.542
- Creatures of habit, we are.
- All right, well, you know what?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.887
You should make a habit of
coming to Verbatim, my new spot.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.281
New? Yeah, I thought
that was a Stern place.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.165
Used to be.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.122
Now it's mine.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.789
<i>- You know DJ Ta}, fight'?
- Yeah, DJ Ta}? He's the shit.</i>

13:08.955 --> 13:11.474
Well, he'll be spinning at the re-launch
party, so you should come through.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.593
Yeah, honestly, mate,
Verbatim, it's kind of tired,

13:13.751 --> 13:15.753
but if Taj is there,
I'll swing by.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.092
Sounds good. I'll comp you.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.148
Make sure you bring all these
beautiful ladies too, okay?

13:19.173 --> 13:20.233
- Sounds-sounds good.
- Sounds good.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.858
- Hey, so cool of you, bro.
- No problem.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.266
How about I swing by a new bottle?
That'll be on me.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.669
- That's very good.
- All right.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.883
I'll be right back with two VIP invites.
Don't shoot too many people with that.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.407
What's up, Andre?

13:42.947 --> 13:45.325
Look, man, I came to work
for you to help you out,

13:45.491 --> 13:48.119
but you keeping me
out the loop, man.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.213
What's up with that card
in that desk?

13:51.372 --> 13:53.215
The one with the blood all over it.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.843
What's up with you
looking in my desk?

13:56.002 --> 13:58.130
The funny thing is I was looking
for a goddamn tie,

13:58.296 --> 14:00.094
but that's not the fucking point.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.559
I've seen that card before.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.187
When I was inside, motherfucker
stuck this Puerto Rican nigga

14:06.346 --> 14:09.566
and left a card just like that on top
of him while he bled the fuck out.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.932
I heard it was some
Mexican Mafia shit or something.

14:13.061 --> 14:16.065
- It's not the Mexican Mafia.
- Well, whatever it is,

14:16.230 --> 14:19.700
you get a card like that,
it means you're in trouble.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.078
It means we're in trouble.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.243
Is that why you want me strapped?

14:28.409 --> 14:30.503
Ghost, listen to me.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.505
What you want me to do,
it'll get done, man.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.177
I want you to go back downstairs.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.430
I want you to get back to work.

14:49.347 --> 14:52.066
And if I need help,
I'll ask you for that.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.985
No, you won't, man.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.721
- Thank you.
- And you, sir?

15:22.964 --> 15:24.716
Nothing for me, thanks.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.806
That's a first.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.642
Not like you to pass up a meal.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.164
I mean,
you love the pancakes here.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.742
Just give me my money so I can
get the fuck out of here already.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.394
What is going on with you?

15:36.561 --> 15:39.601
I mean, I know you and Ghost got beef,
but that ain't got shit to do with me.

15:39.626 --> 15:40.569
I don't know.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.851
Maybe I had a little chat
with Kanan before he kicked.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.657
He had a pretty fucking
interesting theory

15:44.819 --> 15:46.254
about how we got set up
in the first place.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.280
You want to hear it?

15:47.405 --> 15:50.284
Little story about a broken taillight
and an anonymous tip from a woman?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.293
Look, Tommy,
I don't know what Kanan...

15:52.452 --> 15:53.954
Don't even try to fucking lie to me.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.418
Ghost already copped to
the two of you setting him up.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.884
Just eat your goddamn pancakes.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.763
Okay, you want to talk
about lying?

16:04.922 --> 16:07.300
How long was Ghost
fucking Miss Puerto Rico

16:07.467 --> 16:08.468
before you told me?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.186
Wait, you never did.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.769
You lied to me about Kanan
for ten years like I was a fucking chump.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.774
Tommy, we couldn't tell you, okay?

16:15.933 --> 16:18.173
I mean, the fewer people
who knew about Kanan the better.

16:18.198 --> 16:20.609
We had to do what was best
for you, for everyone.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.115
Best for me?

16:23.274 --> 16:26.778
Maybe that's why Ghost
started fucking Angela.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.867
He was just doing
what was best for you.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.122
It's like that?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.966
Take your fucking money, Tommy.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.631
The truth is, in both our cases,

16:46.797 --> 16:49.926
Ghost had us doing
what was best for him.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.817
I need security at my booth.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.482
I hate being bothered
and people making requests...

17:04.648 --> 17:06.242
so dodgy-

17:06.400 --> 17:10.200
And I need the DJ booth moved
to the center of the dance floor.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.991
The DJ booth
is up there to the left.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.877
That's very nice for you, but I need
to be at the center of the event

17:15.910 --> 17:17.662
so I can control the crowd.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.330
All right, I'll try to get it done.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.172
There's no trying involved,
is there?

17:23.334 --> 17:26.178
Get the DJ booth moved to
the center of the dance floor

17:26.337 --> 17:28.840
or I can't perform here.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.680
The legendary DJ Taj.
It's great to meet you, man.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.515
We're so excited for you to join us.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.521
He doesn't shake hands.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.899
- I really don't.
- I see.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.936
- You see this shit?
- I was just saying to your employee,

17:41.102 --> 17:44.948
I will be needing the DJ booth moved to
the center of the dance floor because...

17:45.106 --> 17:46.858
You don't need to explain.
Consider it done.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.277
- Get someone on it right way, all right?
- Cheers.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.866
- I'll see you at sound check.
- See you then.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.371
This motherfucker wants
a fresh quart of orange juice

17:59.537 --> 18:01.084
delivered to him
every 30 minutes.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.249
He think he Beyoncé
or something?

18:03.416 --> 18:04.793
You know what, man?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.599
He's gonna make us
a lot of fucking money.

18:06.624 --> 18:08.638
He's the hottest DJ
in EDM right now, all right?

18:08.796 --> 18:11.925
He's got a huge following,
and you can't show him a gun

18:12.091 --> 18:14.640
and expect him to do
what you want him to do.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.322
Come on, Andre,
it don't work that way.

18:16.347 --> 18:18.270
- It's a club, man.
- Fuck him.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.066
Sometimes you have to do
what you got to do.

18:21.225 --> 18:25.571
Speaking of fucking which, I need to
get him to sign these damn contracts.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.244
Can you handle the contracts?
Something just came up.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.125
What's up?

18:39.160 --> 18:41.083
I get it.
It's none of my business, right?

18:41.245 --> 18:44.590
Just put the booth where he wants it
and get the contracts signed.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.606
Yo, man, my dad's pissed
you skimped on our shit.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.608
This order's half of
what you promised.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.519
That's why I'm only taking
half the money.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.155
- Now, what's the problem?
- Problem is not enough for profit.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.783
We run out too quickly.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.285
With no drugs,
we cannot hold territory.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.564
I understand why you're mad.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.368
You want more drugs.
I want more money.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.955
If I had more drugs, I would gladly
take more of your money, but I don't.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.336
The problem will be resolved
quickly, I promise.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.918
- Your promise is worth shit!
- Hey.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.633
We should go back to
our old connect.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.136
I can't make you buy my drugs,

19:30.294 --> 19:32.614
but it's gonna take you a long time
to find another connect

19:32.639 --> 19:34.303
that will hook you up
with this quality.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.637
Time is money.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.680
Now, you want to waste money, or you
want to get this shit on the street?

19:38.705 --> 19:40.187
We made a deal.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.316
I have made promises
because of our deal.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.351
I understand that,
but I ran into problems

19:45.518 --> 19:47.638
that I couldn't have predicted,
and because of that...

19:47.663 --> 19:50.257
This kind of shit makes us look bad
on the streets, homie.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.119
The circumstances
were out of my hands...

19:59.281 --> 20:01.409
but that will be remedied soon.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.714
Next shipment,
which will be sooner than normal,

20:06.872 --> 20:10.422
I'll throw in a couple of keys
on the house to make up for this...

20:10.584 --> 20:11.836
inconvenience.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.299
How's that sound?

20:20.428 --> 20:22.351
We all have setbacks.

20:22.513 --> 20:25.016
It is how we move forward
that is important.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.934
Word up.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.353
Domo arigato.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.771
Yo, that's Japanese, son.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.657
Do you even know
how offensive that shit is?

20:31.682 --> 20:35.027
It is the effort that counts.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.376
Stay for dinner, please.

20:44.535 --> 20:48.210
Enjoy some of our services
on the house.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.717
I got a lady and a pizza at home,

20:51.876 --> 20:53.878
- but I appreciate the offer.
- Hey, hey.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.093
Bro, you might be happily married,
but I ain't got no girl at home.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.553
Slow your roll, tiger.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.718
There'll be time for that.
We got work to do.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.889
Shin, Dylan,
pleasure doing business with you.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.566
Oh, shit.

21:11.729 --> 21:14.403
What up, Dre?
The fuck you been hiding?

21:14.565 --> 21:16.567
Shit, just grinding,
trying to get this paper, man.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.453
- What's poppin', man?
- You don't look like you on no grind.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.132
You look like you
about to go to court.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.619
- You got a bail hearing, B?
- Nah, motherfucker.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.959
I run three nightclubs, so I got to
dress like a goddamn citizen, man.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.749
- Shit, what I miss?
- You ain't missing shit.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.294
Same old, except remember Tru?

21:34.460 --> 21:35.928
That nigga from down south?

21:36.086 --> 21:37.588
He got clipped last week.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.474
No reason... just wrong place,
wrong time.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.011
Niggas be out here wilding for real.

21:43.177 --> 21:46.272
Speaking of which, I ain't see
your boy Kanan in a minute.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.979
Shit, ain't no telling
where he at, man.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.269
Just thought maybe
he went corporate too.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.279
Might see you niggas
on "Shark Tank“ and shit.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.612
Whatever, man.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.028
Yo, them clubs
be raking in that dough.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.909
Or you wouldn't fuck with it.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.914
I know you, nigga.
You a grimy street cat like me.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.545
We need to hit they ass for a lick.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.797
People buy drinks
with cash over there, right?

22:11.956 --> 22:14.129
Got to be a lot of loot
up in that spot.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.508
Nah, ain't the move, bro.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.137
- Shit, this nigga's gone soft overnight.
- Fuck nah, man.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.855
I'm just saying I just
started working over there,

22:19.880 --> 22:21.720
so I don't know the ins and outs
of everything.

22:21.745 --> 22:23.509
What I do know is
they got security cameras

22:23.676 --> 22:25.394
and ex-militia
watching that front door.

22:25.553 --> 22:29.228
I ain't getting sent back upstate for
nobody, especially your black ass.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.980
Bad news is,
couldn't get a location on Lobos.

22:37.106 --> 22:40.155
- How hard you try?
- I'm not a goddamn magician.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.662
He's not in the system anymore.
You know what is in the system?

22:43.821 --> 22:45.664
Death certificate.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.997
You absolutely sure
Lobos is still alive?

22:49.159 --> 22:51.002
Yes.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.761
Someone's going to a lot of trouble
to make it look the other way.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.833
Most likely,
he's in witness protection,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.925
and you're fucked 'cause
he's halfway to Arizona by now.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.968
Lobos wouldn't snitch.
Not his style.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.855
Multiple stab wounds in the belly...

23:10.014 --> 23:12.062
that could change a man's style.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.226
If you're right,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.361
I can only think of
one other option.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.693
It's called a John Doe prosecution.

23:18.856 --> 23:21.450
New York Feds have a history
with these cases.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.203
Lobos will be tried
in a closed court.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.240
No one knows his real name.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.125
It only gets approved
when the identity of the defendant

23:30.284 --> 23:32.753
is dangerous information in itself.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.586
The person's life has to be
under credible threat.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.295
So the attempt on his life...

23:37.458 --> 23:39.756
Yup, probably caused
the U.S. Attorney

23:39.919 --> 23:42.593
to go John Doe to keep him safe.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.928
If this is a John Doe situation,

23:45.090 --> 23:47.434
you got a better chance
of finding Jimmy Hoffa.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.311
I see.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.640
Does Lobos know
you tried to kill him?

23:53.849 --> 23:57.149
- I never said I tried to kill him.
- Cut the shit.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.938
I'm your attorney here,

23:59.104 --> 24:01.527
and I need to know
if you're in real danger.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.035
Do you think Lobos is
gonna make a move on you?

24:06.820 --> 24:07.912
I don't know.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.272
Well, if you don't know,
then you can't watch your back.

24:10.297 --> 24:12.584
You need to ask Angela

24:12.743 --> 24:15.121
how to find Lobos...

24:16.205 --> 24:18.299
so you could close the issue.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.336
I can't do that.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.176
You may have to decide

24:24.338 --> 24:26.807
between protecting your girl

24:26.966 --> 24:28.513
or saving your own life.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.724
I know which one I would choose.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.316
What's up, baby?
You drunk already?

24:44.817 --> 24:47.696
We didn't get one call
about Bell, not one.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.863
Give it some time.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.828
Those flyers only been up
for a minute.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.790
I don't think we're gonna find her.
I think she's dead.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.498
I brought you home
some big bucks.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.294
That might make you happy.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.639
Holy shit.

25:07.798 --> 25:09.345
Can't believe we have
so much money.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.636
- Yeah.
- It's legit.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.804
Well, it will be
when I put it in the bank,

25:13.971 --> 25:16.975
but I got a ton of shit to do, so...

25:17.141 --> 25:19.501
I got nothing to do tomorrow.
I'll handle the thing for you.

25:19.526 --> 25:21.699
Holly, Holly, I'll handle it.

25:23.147 --> 25:25.991
Oh, come on, baby,
you want to handle something?

25:26.150 --> 25:27.948
Handle this.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.663
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you like that?

25:35.826 --> 25:37.248
Fuck, yeah.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.004
- Oh, yeah, I do.
- Oh, yeah.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.915
Oh, yeah.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.504
You read my mind.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.169
Come on, baby, come on.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.512
Oh, fuck, yeah.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.673
Julito, tell Tommy
to call me back.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.888
Shit's going down
he needs to fucking know about.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.520
Do whatever you got to do
to get him to hit me back.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.392
- Steve.
- Yeah?

26:00.559 --> 26:02.199
I want the lasers
to go through the smoke,

26:02.352 --> 26:04.901
and I want the snow
to fall simultaneously.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.024
All of this needs to happen at midnight,
but I want to see it now if I can.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.789
My man.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.794
All right, folks, thank you.

26:19.953 --> 26:22.797
Thank you all for your hard work.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.300
It looks beautiful.
We're gonna have a great time.

26:25.459 --> 26:26.631
Thank you, guys.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.594
- Looks great, doesn't it?
- It looks awesome.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.760
- What's the word on Taj?
- I got some bad news.

26:30.923 --> 26:34.302
DJ Taj just tweeted that he's playing
at Visage tonight across the street.

26:34.468 --> 26:37.267
- How the fuck did this happen?
- Well, he went with a higher bidder.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.557
Andre never made him
sign the contract.

26:39.723 --> 26:43.102
I want to see Andre right away,
and get a replacement DJ for tonight.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.394
Okay, I'm on it.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.681
- Who owns the club across the street?
- I don't know.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.490
Find out.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.617
- Motherfuckers right there.
- Just hangin' out.

27:00.077 --> 27:03.798
Hey, also, angel wings
and the group, they can come in.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.505
Ladies.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.389
Hey, cheers for the DJ, mate.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.433
Hey.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.232
Hey, aren't those the guys
from the VIP...

27:17.257 --> 27:19.643
They're the owners of the club.
They scooped us.

27:19.805 --> 27:22.274
Look, man, I'm sorry I fucked up.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.979
I got a DJ coming tonight.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.903
He's from my hood.
He's on his way right now.

27:25.928 --> 27:26.858
Yeah? You know what?

27:27.020 --> 27:28.700
Maybe next time <i>we</i> can get
the fucking dude

27:28.863 --> 27:30.503
who runs the bodega
on the corner to spin.

27:30.615 --> 27:33.827
- Yo, I'm hustling, man.
- No, your head ain't in the game.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.034
You weren't so concerned
about my business,

27:36.196 --> 27:37.631
maybe you wouldn't have
made this damn mistake.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.283
He left right after sound check.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.649
I thought I had time to do it
before he went on tonight.

27:41.674 --> 27:43.294
Look, I don't know this shit.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.205
I'm a hustler.
I-l know the streets.

27:45.372 --> 27:48.592
If you want shit done a certain way, then
maybe you should do it yourself, bro.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.305
Look, I'm on your team, man.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.010
I'm mad too.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.642
Look, they right there.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.760
We can go fuck them
bitch-ass niggas up right now.

27:58.785 --> 28:01.163
It'd make me feel better.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.149
So you just gonna
let them punk you like that?

28:04.308 --> 28:05.810
You know what?

28:05.976 --> 28:08.320
Sometimes no response
is the best response.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.153
So we not gonna make a move,
not right now, Andre.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.159
They'd be expecting it.

28:14.318 --> 28:17.162
We'll let them wait in fear.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.494
We make a plan,
and then we attack.

28:39.009 --> 28:41.603
Tasha, come in.

28:45.098 --> 28:47.351
It takes a while to get used to
the childproof doorknobs.

28:49.478 --> 28:50.855
Jamie didn't mention you were...

28:51.021 --> 28:52.541
I didn't tell Ghost I was stopping by.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.693
I needed to see where my kids
are gonna be.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.867
Yasmine is potty training.

29:04.034 --> 29:06.434
She doesn't like to go alone,
so you'll need to sit with her.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.419
- I can do that.
- Good.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.299
Make sure you
put her down around 7:30.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.755
Read her a book.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.297
Give her a sippy cup
with warm organic milk, 2%.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.463
She won't drink anything else.
Whole is too creamy.

29:18.488 --> 29:20.308
Skim isn't creamy enough.
It's a whole thing.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.641
L-I covered
all the electrical outlets

29:23.804 --> 29:26.057
and got latches on the cabinets.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.225
You still need corner guards
for the coffee table.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.900
And keep all sharp objects

29:32.062 --> 29:33.939
out of Yasmine's reach, mm-kay?

29:34.106 --> 29:36.825
- Your eye level or higher.
- Absolutely.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.488
Other than that...

29:40.654 --> 29:42.406
the place looks good.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.457
Smaller than I pictured.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.665
Where are Tariq and Raina
gonna sleep?

29:47.828 --> 29:49.671
Are their bedrooms this way?

29:49.830 --> 29:51.878
It's just our room in there.

29:53.166 --> 29:56.466
Jamie said the kids would be okay
on the floor with sleeping bags.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.346
If that doesn't work for you...

29:58.505 --> 30:00.257
No, it's fine. They'll be fine.

30:02.259 --> 30:04.102
I think we've covered it, so...

30:06.930 --> 30:08.853
Tasha?

30:11.768 --> 30:13.020
Thank you.

30:14.146 --> 30:17.195
You wanted him,
you wanted them, okay?

30:18.275 --> 30:20.027
Remember that.

30:20.193 --> 30:22.412
You better be sure
you're ready for this.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.875
I can't just deposit the check?

30:31.038 --> 30:33.962
L just need a signature
on a couple of documents.

30:34.124 --> 30:36.627
It's standard procedure
to fill out these IRS forms

30:36.793 --> 30:38.795
when it comes to deposits
this large, miss.

30:39.629 --> 30:43.224
I assume you're authorized by
Mr. Egan to sign for the account?

30:43.383 --> 30:45.477
If you could just provide me
with a photo ID,

30:45.635 --> 30:47.478
I can get started with the process.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.186
And which account did you
want to deposit it in,

30:50.349 --> 30:52.067
the personal checking
or the LLC?

30:53.268 --> 30:55.566
If you'd just punch in
the security code and the password,

30:55.729 --> 30:58.699
I can access the account online,
and we could expedite the process.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.655
If you forgot the password,

31:00.817 --> 31:02.819
I'm sure if we call Mr. Egan,
he could help.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.546
- I'll just dial him up right now.
- No.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.915
I don't want to bother him at work.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.160
I'll come back.

31:15.832 --> 31:19.336
- I don't want to go over there.
- It's just one night.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.928
But why?
Why do we have to, like, sleep over?

31:23.090 --> 31:24.262
Why can't we just come home?

31:24.424 --> 31:26.552
Because your father wants you there.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.188
Look, I want you both to be
on your best behavior.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.691
Show this woman
how well you were raised.

31:32.849 --> 31:35.729
All right, we will, but why do we have
to be punished for Dad's mistakes?

31:35.754 --> 31:38.234
Tariq, you're not
being punished, okay?

31:38.397 --> 31:40.946
Your father wants you
to be a part of his life.

31:41.108 --> 31:44.533
- He loves you.
- Do you still love him, Mom?

31:49.491 --> 31:51.710
Your father...

31:52.369 --> 31:54.463
gave me you guys-

31:56.039 --> 31:57.882
We're a family.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.543
Come here.

32:01.128 --> 32:03.881
Family is forever, okay?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.720
It's never over.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.384
Come here.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.974
Come here.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.032
What the hell were you thinking
going down there?

32:14.057 --> 32:16.310
I was doing you a favor.
I was depositing your check.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.274
I told you that I would
take care of it.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.735
You weren't gonna do it,
so I figured I'd do it myself.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.899
All right, from now on,
you don't make no moves

32:23.066 --> 32:25.114
without talking about it
with me first, all right?

32:25.277 --> 32:28.406
Not about nothing, you hear me?
But especially my fucking money.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.074
I thought that was our money.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.039
Even if it is, then you sure as shit
should have run it by me.

32:33.910 --> 32:36.070
All right, if we're gonna
be in this for the long haul,

32:36.163 --> 32:38.040
we got to be 100
with each other.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.633
No lies, no...

32:40.792 --> 32:43.545
sneaking around
each other's fucking backs.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.307
'Kay, you're right.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.272
It won't happen again.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.482
I'm sorry.

32:59.644 --> 33:00.941
Bet.

33:01.104 --> 33:03.653
I won't make any moves
without talking to you first,

33:03.815 --> 33:05.283
but you got to let me help.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.946
If we're gonna be partners,
then let's be partners.

33:09.112 --> 33:12.286
- What you want to do, partner?
- I don't know.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.969
I thought maybe you could teach me
how to move the money around.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.168
Then I could do it.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.330
How did you set this all up?

33:18.497 --> 33:20.057
I don't know.
Tasha did all that for me.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.213
Tasha knows how to do this?

33:22.375 --> 33:25.219
I thought her banking skills
were strictly withdrawal only.

33:25.378 --> 33:28.302
Nah, T's real smart
about this kind of shit.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.467
She studied fucking accounting.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.274
She almost got her diploma
and everything.

33:32.299 --> 33:33.728
Almost?

33:33.887 --> 33:36.310
She married Ghost and quit school.

33:36.473 --> 33:39.522
Look, I know Tasha's a bitch,
but maybe we should bring her in on this.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.284
She can teach me
how to handle the money.

33:41.311 --> 33:42.312
No, no way.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.239
I don't want nothing to do
with those people.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.597
You just said it. She's smart.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.535
You and Ghost never
got nabbed by the IRS, right?

33:48.693 --> 33:50.493
Look, since Ghost closed down
the laundromats,

33:50.656 --> 33:53.136
we're gonna need to figure out
another way to handle the money.

33:53.242 --> 33:55.708
Baby, I'm gonna fuck this up
if I do it on my own.

33:55.867 --> 33:59.121
We use Tasha till I learn the ropes,
and then we get rid of her.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.014
<i>I</i> Gotta go.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.846
But we'll figure this out
together, okay?

34:12.007 --> 34:13.885
Okay-

34:16.096 --> 34:17.973
Together.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.817
Together.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.277
I was thinking about something.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.489
If I had found
the location on Lobos...

34:32.696 --> 34:34.447
you had a plan in place?

34:35.364 --> 34:36.491
I did.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.835
That's a loose end.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.873
He doesn't know who I am.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.462
He never did.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.378
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.255
You're worth the money.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.551
You have no idea.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.946
It was you, right?

35:07.105 --> 35:08.745
Why did you send it
back to the precincts?

35:09.899 --> 35:11.993
Why did I send what
back to what precincts?

35:12.986 --> 35:14.488
The evidence of the murders

35:14.654 --> 35:16.814
the Jimenez ordered against
Lobos's New York Syndicate?

35:16.906 --> 35:19.329
Vladimir and Drifty

35:19.492 --> 35:21.290
and the attempt
on Lobos himself?

35:21.453 --> 35:24.582
The La Arafia cards, the crime scene
photos, witness statements...

35:24.748 --> 35:27.001
It's all been farmed
back out to the NYPD,

35:27.167 --> 35:29.010
to the individual precincts.

35:29.169 --> 35:30.569
It'll take months to get that back.

35:30.594 --> 35:32.635
It's all gone, and oops,

35:32.797 --> 35:35.926
no one signed the orders
to return it to the locals.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.891
Well, that's just the kind of
sloppy thing you would do.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.689
Okay, I know you
don't trust me, Saxe.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.274
Hell, I probably wouldn't
trust me if I were you,

35:47.437 --> 35:51.613
but I wasn't even here when that
evidence was gathered, remember?

35:51.775 --> 35:53.869
I was suspended
because of Isabel.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.656
Well, I'm sorry
if I'm jumping to conclusions.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.541
Look, it's probably
some clerical error.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.327
I'm waiting on evidence
from California.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.122
You're looking for...
Wait, what are you looking for?

36:05.288 --> 36:07.791
I'm trying to find the guy
who stabbed Lobos.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.385
I want him to flip on the Jimenez

36:10.543 --> 36:12.466
and give us cause
to prosecute them here too.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.597
That guy's not gonna flip
on the Jimenez.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.472
I don't know, Angela.
The death penalty makes people talk.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.560
Dad, look, she only has four plates.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.726
That's all we need, girl.
Here's Yasmine's plate right here.

36:26.393 --> 36:27.986
Jamie, we need to talk.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.861
- Hey.
- I thought we said 7:00.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.196
- Didn't we say 7:00?
- We did.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.737
The kids got dropped off
a little early. Sorry.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.498
Hi!

36:40.657 --> 36:43.331
Hi, everyone.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.924
Oh, my goodness.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.584
This is the little one.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.172
Hello.

36:52.335 --> 36:53.587
Hello.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.678
The table looks lovely.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.514
That's all Raina's doing.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.724
Thank you.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.980
- It's nice to meet you, Raina.
- Hi.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.858
Tariq, welcome.

37:08.017 --> 37:10.896
Your father talks about you
all the time.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.531
I'm gonna get myself changed,
and then I'm all yours.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.408
Okay, perfect.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.160
Okay-

37:20.071 --> 37:21.698
Perfect.

37:21.865 --> 37:23.583
Okay, go play with your toys.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.165
Raina, let me talk to you
for a minute.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.992
Come on, Yas, you can play
with your toys right here.

37:31.875 --> 37:35.505
Listen, kids,
I know it's hard...

37:37.213 --> 37:39.682
but I want us
to really try, okay?

37:40.884 --> 37:42.511
All right?

37:44.804 --> 37:47.057
He knew where the cameras were.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.893
Wait, wait, wait, stop that.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.259
You back that up a little bit?

37:51.284 --> 37:53.229
Right there, right there.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.818
You zoom in on that?

37:55.815 --> 37:58.455
Yeah, grab that for me. I want to
get a better look at that tattoo.

38:02.697 --> 38:05.075
Okay-

38:08.745 --> 38:10.668
Come on, come on.

38:29.599 --> 38:32.318
You the motherfucker
that broke into my house?

38:32.477 --> 38:35.572
Lobos sent you,
you fucking piece of shit?

38:40.443 --> 38:42.195
English, motherfucker!

38:45.114 --> 38:46.707
This better?

38:46.866 --> 38:50.962
Mr. Lobos is a man
who does what he says,

38:51.120 --> 38:55.216
and he doesn't like to ask
the same question twice, so...

38:55.375 --> 38:56.877
YES.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.466
I was in your home,
where you sleep,

38:59.629 --> 39:01.552
where your woman sleeps.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.967
Was the message received?

39:04.801 --> 39:07.645
Oh, yeah,
I got the fucking message.

39:09.138 --> 39:12.642
And what are you doing about
what you told Jefe you would do?

39:12.809 --> 39:14.152
Ghost got in touch with me.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.405
He wants to meet up tonight,
and when he shows...

39:18.815 --> 39:21.785
I'ma put a fucking bullet
in his head.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.081
Yo, but that shipment was light.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.162
How the fuck am I
supposed to be Lobos's distro

39:28.324 --> 39:30.167
if I ain't got enough shit
to distro?

39:30.326 --> 39:33.546
The next shipment
will be in full after we fix,

39:33.705 --> 39:36.959
unexpected cash flow problems.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.174
- What are you still doing here?
- I found something, Mike.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.010
L think I found the guy.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.674
- The Lobos guy?
- The Lobos guy.

39:44.841 --> 39:47.344
And I think he's still here in MCC.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.683
I'm going there now to talk to him.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.564
You want to come?

39:51.723 --> 39:54.226
No, you go ahead.
We'll discuss it in the morning.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.486
- Night, Saxe.
- Night.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.079
Stick to the story.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.250
Yeah, si.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.035
- I have to take this.
- Yeah.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.454
- We're clone?
- Yeah, we're done.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.122
But you know what?

40:16.247 --> 40:19.877
Me and you very soon are gonna
have to have a little talk about my dog.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.736
You're a lawyer?

40:38.895 --> 40:41.569
- What kind?
- I'm a prosecutor.

40:41.731 --> 40:43.278
I put bad guys in jail.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.991
And she had to make really
good grades in school to do that.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.247
Dad, I get it.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.782
So how'd you guys meet?

40:52.575 --> 40:55.795
Actually, we met in high school.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.752
So before you met Mom?

40:59.415 --> 41:03.420
Hey, Tariq, I got you

41:03.586 --> 41:05.805
your favorite video game.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.142
You can play it now if you want.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.100
- Everything's set up, I think.
- That TV's way too small.

41:13.262 --> 41:15.185
My mom got a big screen at home.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.810
Son, take one of these.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.196
Show your old man how it's done.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.363
- Go.
- You know you gonna lose, right?

41:27.735 --> 41:29.575
How you gonna beat me
with sad moves like that?

41:29.654 --> 41:32.282
Sad moves?
I'm about to whup you, man.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.450
You is going...

41:34.617 --> 41:36.119
Down!

41:36.285 --> 41:38.333
- You need to get up. You too old.
- You right.

41:40.957 --> 41:43.301
- Oh, man!
- Yeah, s'up?

41:43.459 --> 41:44.631
This boy's kinda good.

41:44.794 --> 41:47.138
He's not that good.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.390
- I will beat you too.
- Angela, I need to take this.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.472
You mind showing my son
how it's done?

41:51.634 --> 41:54.433
- Me?
- Yeah. I'll be right back.

41:56.431 --> 41:59.651
I used to play PlayStation
with my nephew sometimes.

41:59.809 --> 42:02.028
How different could this be?

42:08.609 --> 42:10.862
Did you get the check?

42:11.029 --> 42:12.656
Yeah, I got it.

42:12.822 --> 42:15.041
Any problem with the number?

42:15.199 --> 42:16.997
Yo, you didn't call me
to shoot the shit.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.128
What's up?

42:21.581 --> 42:24.460
Look, man, it's... it's better
we meet and discuss it in person.

42:25.501 --> 42:28.425
Yeah, all right.

45:42.531 --> 45:44.533
I've got a big sister too.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.623
I'd be lost without her.

45:46.786 --> 45:48.709

45:51.040 --> 45:52.542

45:52.708 --> 45:54.551

wants to be picked up.

He should be. I made the call.

46:13.604 --> 46:15.606

51:39.722 --> 51:41.395
What happened?

51:43.392 --> 51:45.611
I'm not okay.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.612
You're not okay.

51:47.771 --> 51:50.115
We're not safe.
They're gonna kill us.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.072
I fucked up.

51:52.234 --> 51:54.362
I had him right there.

51:57.323 --> 51:58.916
I didn't do it.

52:00.075 --> 52:01.793
Okay, tell me what happened.

52:01.952 --> 52:03.670
Tommy, tell me what's going on.

52:03.829 --> 52:07.254
Come on. Give me the gun.

52:08.208 --> 52:10.085
Come on.

52:10.252 --> 52:11.720
Give me...

52:20.346 --> 52:23.316
I was supposed to kill Ghost tonight,
but I couldn't do it.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.476
What?

52:25.643 --> 52:27.486
Lobos ordered me to kill Ghost,

52:27.645 --> 52:30.239
and since I didn't do it,
he's coming after us.

52:32.149 --> 52:34.743
Bell didn't get lost, Holly.

52:36.737 --> 52:39.286
Lobos had her killed
as a warning.

52:39.448 --> 52:41.792
He told me he was gonna do it.

52:41.950 --> 52:44.123
Said he was gonna kill her

52:44.286 --> 52:47.961
and then you if I didn't kill Ghost,
and he did.

52:49.792 --> 52:51.544
He did it, Holly.

52:51.710 --> 52:54.554
Bell is dead 'cause of me.

53:00.969 --> 53:02.562
I understand.

53:08.310 --> 53:10.404
He was my brother...

53:11.980 --> 53:15.450
- my whole life, my family.
- I know.

53:16.443 --> 53:18.411
I know he was.

53:28.956 --> 53:31.129
I know you can do this.

53:33.836 --> 53:35.838
What?

53:37.423 --> 53:40.302
I know you can kill Ghost.

53:44.972 --> 53:47.600
If you can't kill Ghost
for yourself, Tommy...

53:54.523 --> 53:55.945
do it for me.

54:00.070 --> 54:01.868
Do it.

54:07.369 --> 54:09.371
I will.

54:09.538 --> 54:11.131
I promise.

54:19.923 --> 54:21.766

54:21.925 --> 54:24.553

I have to tell you.

54:26.263 --> 54:27.810

checked with you first.

54:27.973 --> 54:30.101
- What?
- But don't be mad.

54:30.267 --> 54:33.487
- Holly, what did you do?
- Promise you won't be mad.

54:33.645 --> 54:36.023
What did you do, Holly?

54:48.243 --> 54:50.416
