00:15.133 --> 00:18.467
Oh, hi!
Today is all about families--

00:18.467 --> 00:20.700
mommies, daddies,
brothers, sisters,

00:20.700 --> 00:23.300
stepdaddies, stepmothers--
heh, stepbrothers,

00:23.300 --> 00:24.633
and stepsisters.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.000
You know what
a stepsister is?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.800
Well,
you're looking at one.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.900
Ha ha!
Oh! What was that?

00:29.900 --> 00:31.500
Hey. Keep it down,
will you?

00:31.500 --> 00:34.800
Ha ha!
It's just Oscar!

00:34.800 --> 00:37.100
Well, stick around
for more about families

00:37.100 --> 00:38.333
on "Sesame Street."

00:38.333 --> 00:40.500
- Uh, yeah.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.266
Well, you know
what I mean.

00:42.266 --> 00:45.166
- Ehh.
- Ha!

Sesame Street!

01:15.233 --> 01:17.500
Okay, let's see.
Some green for the grass.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.133
Where did Elmo put
the yellow?

01:19.133 --> 01:24.000
Oh, ha ha! Hi there!
Welcome to Sesame Street.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.233
Oh, Elmo's so excited.

01:26.233 --> 01:30.200
Abby's family is having dinner
at Elmo's house tonight.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.433
Oh, they should be here
any minute. Oh, here they are.

01:33.433 --> 01:35.433
- Come on.
- Hi, guys.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.200
Hi, Elmo!

01:37.200 --> 01:40.433
Oh, Daddy,
Abby's family's here. Ha ha!

01:40.433 --> 01:42.133
Come on in.
Welcome.

01:42.133 --> 01:43.800
Hey, Louie!
How are you?

01:43.800 --> 01:45.133
Good to see you.

01:45.133 --> 01:46.867
Oh, oh!
Elmo drew a picture

01:46.867 --> 01:49.300
of all of our families.

01:49.300 --> 01:54.166
Look at that! There's me
and daddy Freddy and Rudy,
and, oh, there's my mommy.

01:54.166 --> 01:58.300
Yeah. Oh, and here's
Elmo's daddy and Elmo
and Elmo's mommy.

01:58.300 --> 01:59.667
Aw!

01:59.667 --> 02:02.500
Um, is Elmo's mommy home?

02:02.500 --> 02:04.967
Oh, she's at her
book club with Abby's mommy.

02:04.967 --> 02:06.300
Uh-huh.

02:06.300 --> 02:09.967
So guess what.
It's "daddy and kids' night."

02:09.967 --> 02:11.400
- Yup, yup.
- Yay!

02:11.400 --> 02:13.700
Hey, does "daddy and kids'
night" mean the same thing

02:13.700 --> 02:16.000
in your family
as it does in ours?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.433
- Yeah!
- Playtime!

02:18.433 --> 02:20.266
Oh, oh!
Elmo wants to play bingo.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.934
- Yeah, "Corgi Dash"!

02:21.934 --> 02:23.400
Hide-and-seek.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.133
Elmo and Abby:
Oh, that's a good one.

02:25.133 --> 02:26.467
- Or hide-and-seek.

02:26.467 --> 02:29.433
Wait! I got it.
Freeze tag.

02:29.433 --> 02:32.433
- Who-oa!
- Oh, but then
we'll need coats,

02:32.433 --> 02:34.233
because when Abby plays
freeze tag,

02:34.233 --> 02:36.567
- things really freeze.

02:36.567 --> 02:39.266
We can play anything
you want,

02:39.266 --> 02:41.900
but first,
we eat dinner.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.433
- Mm-hmm.

02:43.433 --> 02:47.467
- Oh, uh, Daddy...

02:47.467 --> 02:50.300
Can't we play first,
like our family does it?

02:50.300 --> 02:51.967
Well, you see, Rudy,

02:51.967 --> 02:54.834
every family does things
differently.

02:54.834 --> 02:57.133
Yeah, but maybe
their family would like

02:57.133 --> 02:58.967
how our family
does things better

02:58.967 --> 03:01.133
if they tried it
just once.

03:01.133 --> 03:03.000
And maybe we'll like it

03:03.000 --> 03:05.667
if we try it
their way just once.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.734
Oh, maybe.
Let's try it and see.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.533
All right!
That's my little monster.

03:10.533 --> 03:12.433
Yes! Let's go.
There you go.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.934
Okay, everybody,
time to start dinner

03:15.934 --> 03:18.433
like we always do
when Daddy cooks,

03:18.433 --> 03:20.300
with a vote on
what to eat.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.000
But we never get
to vote on dinner.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, I know what I want.
I vote for...

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
- Oh. Grilled cheese.
- Pumpkin ravioli.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.467
- Okay, uh, grilled cheese.
- Or maybe a pizza.

03:30.467 --> 03:35.700
The way we vote is
I give you two choices.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.100
- Two choices.
Oh.

03:37.100 --> 03:42.100
Choice number one--
fish sticks and mashed potatoes.

03:42.100 --> 03:44.467
- Smushed potatoes.
- Smushed potatoes.

03:44.467 --> 03:45.734
Abby and Rudy:
Ooh!

03:45.734 --> 03:47.900
- Choice number two...
- Oh, get ready for this.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.967
Pizza and salad.

03:49.967 --> 03:52.333
- Ah!
- Yeah!

03:52.333 --> 03:55.300
Those are tough choices.
What are you gonna vote for?

03:55.300 --> 03:58.400
I don't know.
Um, I don't know. I...

03:58.400 --> 04:01.500
Oh, I know!
I vote for pizza and salad.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.133
Oh! Elmo votes
for pizza and salad.

04:03.133 --> 04:04.367
- All right.
- Yeah, me, too.

04:04.367 --> 04:07.967
Mm-hmm. The winner is
pizza and salad.

04:07.967 --> 04:09.233
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Yeah!

04:09.233 --> 04:11.033
Ha ha!

04:11.033 --> 04:12.467
Tell you what,

04:12.467 --> 04:18.166
who wants to play
a pizza topping game?

04:18.166 --> 04:19.967
Oh, oh! Elmo does.
Elmo does.

04:19.967 --> 04:23.467
All right.
Well, here we go.

04:23.467 --> 04:28.266
Louie:
♪ Oh, one of these things is
not like the others ♪

04:28.266 --> 04:31.433
♪ One of these things
just doesn't belong ♪

04:31.433 --> 04:35.467
♪ Can you tell which thing
is not like the others ♪

04:35.467 --> 04:39.900
♪ By the time
I finish my song? ♪

04:39.900 --> 04:41.300
Ha ha!

04:41.300 --> 04:44.300
Oh, I know. I know.
Uh, wait. No, I don't.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.033
Let's think.

04:46.033 --> 04:49.133
One of these toppings
is not like the others.

04:49.133 --> 04:50.867
Oh, let's look closely.

04:50.867 --> 04:53.166
Elmo:
Okay, um...

04:53.166 --> 04:55.934
Abby:
Hey, is it that
all of them are round,

04:55.934 --> 04:58.266
except for the mushroom?

04:58.266 --> 04:59.600
Abby is right.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.333
Oh, I was this close
to saying that.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.367
Oh, ho ho.
Good thinking, Abby.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.767
Well, let's play again.

05:07.767 --> 05:11.500
Now find a different way
that one of these toppings

05:11.500 --> 05:13.266
is not like the others.

05:13.266 --> 05:15.133
Oh, I know! I know.

05:15.133 --> 05:18.400
Um, the mushroom.
It's not round.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.600
Well, Rudy, he said
it wasn't by shape.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.033
Shape is how we played
the first time.

05:23.033 --> 05:26.734
Elmo:
All different colors,
so it's not color.

05:26.734 --> 05:28.467
Boy, this is hard.

05:28.467 --> 05:29.734
Yeah.

05:29.734 --> 05:31.700
Oh, wait.
I know! I know.

05:31.700 --> 05:34.467
Oh, Rudy's not gonna say
"mushroom" again, is he? Ha ha!

05:34.467 --> 05:36.233
Uh, maybe.

05:36.233 --> 05:38.567
I mean,
if it's not mushroom,

05:38.567 --> 05:40.300
then the only
other difference

05:40.300 --> 05:42.867
is that the pepperoni
is meat.

05:42.867 --> 05:45.867
Ha ha!
Rudy is right!

05:45.867 --> 05:50.300
Onion, jalapeño pepper,
and mushroom are veggies.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.467
Pepperoni is meat,

05:52.467 --> 05:55.767
so pepperoni
is not like the others.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.400
- I won! I won!
- Ha ha!

05:57.400 --> 05:59.266
All right,
time to make a pizza

05:59.266 --> 06:01.333
with all these
great toppings.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.200
Well, well,
hold on, Daddy.
Hold the phone.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.367
Oh, we didn't vote
for toppings.

06:05.367 --> 06:08.400
Oh, Elmo votes
for no jalapeño peppers.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.600
Ah!

06:09.600 --> 06:11.967
Oh, really? Well, you know,
everyone in my family

06:11.967 --> 06:14.166
loves peppers,
right, kids?

06:14.166 --> 06:16.400
- Eh...
- Well, uh, I don't.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.166
The peppers make
my tum go all "agh"!

06:20.166 --> 06:21.567
Yeah, I'm with Abby.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.767
They make
my whole face go "yaah"!

06:25.000 --> 06:28.467
We'll make one daddy pizza
with peppers

06:28.467 --> 06:32.333
and one kid pizza
with no peppers.

06:32.333 --> 06:35.567
No peppers! Yay!

06:35.567 --> 06:37.567
Louie:
Let's get to pizza-making.

06:37.567 --> 06:40.567
So this is pizza dough.

06:40.567 --> 06:44.734
Whoa. That's really
how you start making a pizza?

06:44.734 --> 06:48.734
Sure. Oh, first Elmo's daddy
puts on the sauce.

06:48.734 --> 06:50.467
Elmo:
Hee hee!

06:50.467 --> 06:52.500
Uh-huh,
and then the other one.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.100
- Wow!
- And then

06:55.100 --> 06:57.600
Daddy adds
the cheese.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.266
- Ooh! Cheese.
- Ooh!

07:00.934 --> 07:02.066
Looking good.

07:02.066 --> 07:04.734
Now some pepperonis.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.300
Elmo:
Ha ha!

07:06.300 --> 07:07.500
Cool.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.834
- And some mushrooms.
- Ha ha!

07:10.834 --> 07:12.633
Very nice.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.500
- Some onions.
- Oh, ho ho!

07:15.500 --> 07:17.033
Abby:
Whew. Don't cry.

07:17.033 --> 07:21.633
And now this one
gets peppers for daddies.

07:21.633 --> 07:23.433
- None for us, please.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.900
How do you know
what to do?

07:25.900 --> 07:28.133
Oh, it's an old
family recipe

07:28.133 --> 07:31.867
handed from grandmothers
to uncles, cousins, nieces,

07:31.867 --> 07:35.033
nephews,
and from my mom to me.

07:35.033 --> 07:38.500
Wow! You sure got a lot
of family.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.800
Yeah, well, families come
in lots of shapes and sizes.

07:41.800 --> 07:45.633
Oh, Elmo's family
is mostly red and furry.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.166
Thanks for helping.

07:48.166 --> 07:51.400
I'd say our families work
pretty well together.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.667
So now what happens?
Oh! Can we play?

07:55.667 --> 07:59.834

09:40.667 --> 09:42.533
Yeah, daddy Freddy was
in an awesome groove.

09:42.533 --> 09:43.734
Yeah!

09:43.734 --> 09:46.500
We can play
whatever you want to

09:46.500 --> 09:49.400
after we all
have dinner together.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.400
Yup, that's how
Elmo's family does it.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.834
Hee hee!

09:52.834 --> 09:55.467
- Whoo. It sure smells good.
- Yes, it does. Yes, it does.

09:55.467 --> 09:58.567
Hey, Daddy, can we eat here
every night?

09:58.567 --> 10:01.400
Ha ha. Well,
I don't know about that, Rudy.

10:01.400 --> 10:05.633
Oh, Elmo wants to see how
Rudy and Abby's family
make dinner.

10:05.633 --> 10:09.100
Yeah, Daddy, can Elmo's family
eat at our house tomorrow

10:09.100 --> 10:11.233
and see how great
we do stuff?

Let's call her together.

21:05.667 --> 21:08.033
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:08.033 --> 21:10.433
( chime plays
"Elmo's Song" )

21:10.433 --> 21:13.300
Elmo,
I am so excited today

21:13.300 --> 21:16.967
because today is
all about siblings!

21:16.967 --> 21:19.734
That's perfect,
Smartie, because Elmo

21:19.734 --> 21:21.667
wants to learn
more about them.

21:21.667 --> 21:24.800
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:24.800 --> 21:28.100
All:
We look it up!

21:28.100 --> 21:30.266
Smartie:
Let's see what we can learn
about siblings.

21:30.266 --> 21:33.433
A sibling is another word
for a brother or a sister.

21:33.433 --> 21:37.367
Families can have
two siblings or three
or even more.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.533
Some siblings may be
younger than you,

21:39.533 --> 21:42.166
some siblings may be
older than you,

21:42.166 --> 21:44.400
and some siblings might
even be the same age

21:44.400 --> 21:46.100
if they're twins.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.066
Siblings may look
like each other,

21:48.066 --> 21:50.333
or they might not.

21:50.333 --> 21:53.767
There are half-siblings,
stepsiblings.

21:53.767 --> 21:55.633
Not everybody has
a sibling,

21:55.633 --> 21:57.600
but if you do have
a sibling,

21:57.600 --> 22:00.033
that means you're
a sibling, too.

22:00.033 --> 22:01.600
Wow!

22:01.600 --> 22:04.700
There are sure are
lots of different kinds
of siblings.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.633
Yeah. I love
my older brother, Flip.

22:07.633 --> 22:10.700
- Yeah.
- We phones have
a strong connection.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.734
Get it?
A phone connection?

22:12.734 --> 22:14.133
- Yeah-eah-eah!
- Ha ha ha!

22:14.133 --> 22:16.200
- Ha ha ha!
- See you later, Elmo!

22:16.200 --> 22:18.467
Oh, thank you, Smartie.

22:18.467 --> 22:22.433
Boy, some families
are small, like Elmo's,

22:22.433 --> 22:27.367
and other families
are big with lots
of siblings.

22:27.367 --> 22:31.133
Hey. That gives
Elmo an idea!

22:31.133 --> 22:33.767
Oh, ho.
Let's play a game together.

22:33.767 --> 22:36.567
Yeah-eah-eah.
Come on, come on!

22:36.567 --> 22:37.633
Ha ha ha!

22:40.166 --> 22:41.100
Ha ha ha!

22:42.500 --> 22:43.800
Ha ha ha!

22:43.800 --> 22:46.200
Elmo wonders which
of these people could

22:46.200 --> 22:47.633
be siblings.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.467
Could these two
be siblings?

22:49.467 --> 22:51.000
Kids:
Yes!

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Girl:
They're a brother
and a sister.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.300
Elmo:
That's right.

22:54.300 --> 22:57.767
Now how about these two,
a boy and a lamp?

22:57.767 --> 22:59.333
Kids:
No!

22:59.333 --> 23:00.734
Girl:
Lamps aren't people.

23:00.734 --> 23:02.166
Elmo:
Right!

23:02.166 --> 23:05.133
A lamp can't be
a brother or a sister,

23:05.133 --> 23:07.066
so a lamp
isn't a sibling.

23:07.066 --> 23:09.467
How about all these
boys and girls?

23:09.467 --> 23:11.667
Could this many
people be siblings?

23:11.667 --> 23:13.133
Kids:
Yes!

23:13.133 --> 23:15.367
Girl:
They're all brothers
and sisters.

23:15.367 --> 23:18.900
Elmo:
They're all siblings,
even the baby!

23:18.900 --> 23:20.233
Hi, baby!

23:20.233 --> 23:23.266
Oh, ho ho ho!
Is Elmo seeing double?

23:23.266 --> 23:25.967
These two
look exactly alike.

23:25.967 --> 23:28.800
Girl:
That's because
they're identical twins.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.200
Elmo:
Oh, yeah.

23:30.200 --> 23:34.367
Some twins do look alike,
so are they siblings?

23:34.367 --> 23:37.567
Kids:
Yes! Twins are siblings!

23:37.567 --> 23:40.000
Elmo:
Yay! Good job, everybody.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.367
Wow! There's so many different
kinds of siblings,

23:44.367 --> 23:47.467
and that makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.967
What do people do
with their siblings?

23:49.967 --> 23:52.266
Hey. Let's ask
Mr. Noodle, okay?

23:52.266 --> 23:55.700
♪ Hey, Mr. Noodle ♪

23:55.700 --> 23:57.734
Oh, ho ho ho!

23:57.734 --> 24:01.367
It's Mr. Noodle's
pet poodle, Schmoodle.

24:01.367 --> 24:02.800
Elmo and kids:
Hi, Schmoodle.

24:04.367 --> 24:08.166
Oh, Schmoodle,
what do you do
with your siblings?

24:08.166 --> 24:12.767
Elmo:
Oh, look! It's Schmoodle
Noodle's sister, Floodle,

24:12.767 --> 24:15.166
and their brother Frank.

24:15.166 --> 24:17.967
Kids:
Schmoodle, Floodle,
and Frank!

24:17.967 --> 24:20.100
Elmo:
What do you all do
with your sibling?

24:20.100 --> 24:21.900
Kid:
They're running around!

24:21.900 --> 24:24.233
I think they're
playing chase.

24:24.233 --> 24:25.900
Elmo:
Siblings play together.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.400
Looks like fun.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.533
Kid:
Now they're eating.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.467
Elmo:
And they're sharing, too.

24:30.467 --> 24:33.066
Siblings share
with each other.

24:33.066 --> 24:35.066
Kids:
Aw, they're tired.

24:35.066 --> 24:38.467
Elmo:
And the best part of all--
siblings care for each other.

24:38.467 --> 24:40.867
Kids:
Sweet dreams, doggies.

24:40.867 --> 24:42.600
Ha ha! Hee hee!

24:42.600 --> 24:46.333
Boy, learning new things
makes Elmo so happy,
