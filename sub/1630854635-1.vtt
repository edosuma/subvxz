WEBVTT

00:52.487 --> 00:55.011
This story ends
before you were born.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.595
Mother.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.515
Again.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.302
When we woke up

01:25.302 --> 01:28.000
feeling hands that
were no longer there,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.699
the elders told us
that it was the work of ghosts

01:31.395 --> 01:32.570
or Satan.

01:36.444 --> 01:40.012
Or that we were lying
to get attention.

01:40.012 --> 01:43.451
Or that it was an act
of wild female imagination.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.719
It went on for years.

01:53.461 --> 01:54.636
To all of us.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.169
It felt like weightlessness.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.217
It felt like drifting over
what used to be real.

02:13.394 --> 02:16.397
- It felt like a banishment,

02:16.397 --> 02:18.094
as though we had
no invitation anymore

02:18.094 --> 02:19.922
to be a part of the real.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.107
I used to wonder
who I would be

02:31.107 --> 02:33.979
if it hadn't happened to me.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.460
I used to miss the person
I might have been.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.115
I don't anymore.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.467
Because it's doomsday

02:43.467 --> 02:44.947
and a call to prayer.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.341
It's both.

02:54.478 --> 02:55.827
We caught one of them.

02:56.437 --> 02:57.873
I saw his face.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.745
And then he named the others.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.226
Come on.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.541
Eventually the attackers

03:13.541 --> 03:15.804
were taken to the police
in the city

03:15.804 --> 03:17.197
for their own protection.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.554
Almost all of the men
of the colony

03:26.554 --> 03:27.816
went to the city to post bail

03:27.816 --> 03:29.165
for the attackers.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.602
We were given two days

03:31.602 --> 03:33.822
to forgive the attackers
before they returned.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.782
If we did not forgive them

03:37.782 --> 03:39.958
we would be ordered
to leave the colony

03:39.958 --> 03:42.918
and be denied entry
into the Kingdom of Heaven.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.452
Do nothing.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.413
Stay and fight.

04:02.851 --> 04:03.852
Leave.

04:32.184 --> 04:35.623
Girls in our colony
had very little schooling.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.016
We hardly knew
how to read or to write.

04:38.887 --> 04:40.541
But that day,

04:40.541 --> 04:42.020
we learned how to vote.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.815
The vote was tied between

05:37.815 --> 05:40.862
staying and fighting,
or leaving.

05:40.862 --> 05:43.778
So three families
including yours and mine

05:43.778 --> 05:45.170
were elected to decide

05:45.170 --> 05:46.911
what the women
of the colony would do.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.794
Your mother had asked,
August, the school teacher,

05:59.794 --> 06:02.231
to take the minutes
of our meeting.

06:02.231 --> 06:06.148
August came back to the colony
just recently.

06:06.148 --> 06:09.107
His family had been
excommunicated years ago.

06:17.638 --> 06:20.510
August had loved your mother
since he was a boy.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.529
Before we began,

06:39.529 --> 06:41.183
your grandmother, Agata,

06:41.183 --> 06:43.533
told us we had to honor
our service to each other.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.189
We had to represent it.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.886
Just as the disciples
were washed

06:48.886 --> 06:51.541
by Jesus at the Last Supper,

06:51.541 --> 06:54.109
knowing that his hour
had come.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.462
We only had 24 hours

06:59.462 --> 07:02.334
to imagine what world
you would be born into.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.340
It is a part
of our faith to forgive.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.255
We have always forgiven those
who have wronged us.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.343
Why not now?

07:11.343 --> 07:12.823
Because now we know better.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.434
We will be excommunicated,

07:14.434 --> 07:16.131
forced to leave the colony
in disgrace

07:16.131 --> 07:17.785
if we do not forgive
these men.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.222
And if we are excommunicated,

07:20.222 --> 07:23.181
we forfeit our place
in Heaven.

07:23.181 --> 07:26.446
How could any of you
live with the fear of that?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.622
These are
legitimate fears.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.494
How can we address them?

07:31.494 --> 07:34.018
The only
important thing to establish

07:34.018 --> 07:35.933
is if we forgive the men.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.415
So that we will be allowed
to enter the gates of Heaven.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.200
You can laugh
all you like, Salome,

07:42.200 --> 07:43.550
but we will be forced
to leave the colony

07:43.550 --> 07:44.594
if we don't forgive the men.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.162
How will the Lord
when he arrives

07:47.162 --> 07:48.903
find the women
if we aren't in the colony?

07:48.903 --> 07:50.513
Jesus is able
to return to life,

07:50.513 --> 07:51.906
live for thousands of years

07:51.906 --> 07:53.385
and then drop down
to earth from Heaven

07:53.385 --> 07:54.604
to scoop up his supporters,

07:54.604 --> 07:56.301
surely he'd also
be able to locate

07:56.301 --> 07:57.433
a few women
who left their colony.

07:57.433 --> 07:58.521
Let's stay on track.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.740
All right. I'll stay on track.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.655
I cannot forgive them.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.352
I will never forgive them.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.876
I can't either.

08:07.617 --> 08:08.792
But we want to enter

08:08.792 --> 08:10.098
the Kingdom of Heaven
when we die.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.365
We have everything
we want here.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.540
No.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.846
Want less.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.371
Does entering
the Kingdom of Heaven

08:22.371 --> 08:24.025
mean nothing to any of you?

08:24.025 --> 08:25.592
Surely there must be something

08:25.592 --> 08:28.159
worth living for in this life,
not only in the next.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.043
Autje!

08:42.043 --> 08:43.305
- See you soon. It's all right.
-  Sorry.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.872
It's all right.
It will be all right.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.361
Your grandmother
used to say,

08:56.361 --> 08:58.450
"Find out where
you can be of help

08:58.450 --> 09:00.757
"and leave what
you can't help behind."

09:01.889 --> 09:03.020
I think that's easier

09:03.020 --> 09:04.761
when you're old like her.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.850
So we must decide now

09:06.850 --> 09:09.940
to stay and fight, or leave.

09:09.940 --> 09:12.160
Those are the options
in front of us.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.816
We will not do nothing.

09:19.341 --> 09:22.431
I want to talk about
my horses Ruth and Cheryl.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.828
When Ruth and Cheryl
are frightened by Dueck's dogs

09:27.828 --> 09:30.700
on the mile road
that leads to the church,

09:30.700 --> 09:32.615
their initial instinct
is to bolt.

09:33.834 --> 09:34.922
Whoa!

09:36.663 --> 09:38.665
These horses
don't organize meetings

09:38.665 --> 09:40.623
to decide what they will do.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.233
They run.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.584
But, Greta,
we are not animals.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.890
We have been preyed upon
like animals.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.371
Maybe we should respond
like animals.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.459
In my lifetime,
I have seen

09:50.459 --> 09:52.417
horses confront angry dogs

09:52.417 --> 09:54.463
and try to stomp them
to death.

09:54.463 --> 09:55.899
Animals don't always flee.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.597
Is this how we want
to teach our daughters

09:57.597 --> 09:59.250
to defend themselves?

09:59.250 --> 10:00.425
By fleeing?

10:00.425 --> 10:01.601
Not fleeing but leaving.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.819
I was just talking
about leaving.

10:02.819 --> 10:03.951
I would rather
stand my ground

10:03.951 --> 10:05.126
and shoot each man
in the heart

10:05.126 --> 10:06.562
and bury 'em in a pit
than flee.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.216
And I'll deal with God's wrath
if I have to.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.000
Salome, Aunt Greta is talking
about leaving not fleeing.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.872
The word "fleeing"
wasn't what she meant.

10:11.872 --> 10:14.918
Yeah. Please forgive my mother
for using the wrong word.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.137
It's a sin so outrageous

10:16.137 --> 10:17.747
that Salome has taken it
upon herself

10:17.747 --> 10:19.967
to rectify for the sake
of all humanity.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.491
"Leaving" and "fleeing"
are different words

10:22.491 --> 10:24.580
with different meanings.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.669
They each say
something about us.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.894
August,

10:33.894 --> 10:36.070
what do you make
of all of this?

10:36.070 --> 10:37.898
Do you have an opinion too?

10:39.551 --> 10:40.596
I think...

10:42.424 --> 10:44.687
I think that it is possible

10:44.687 --> 10:46.776
to leave something
or someone...

10:49.561 --> 10:51.955
in one frame of mind

10:51.955 --> 10:55.437
and arrive elsewhere
in another

10:55.437 --> 10:58.048
entirely unexpected
frame of mind.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.833
I want to stay and fight.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.095
But won't we lose the fight
to the men

11:01.095 --> 11:03.097
and be forced
to forgive them anyway?

11:03.097 --> 11:04.446
I want to stay and fight too.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.969
No one's surprised
that you do.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.536
All you do is fight.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.320
Is this really
how we are to decide

11:09.320 --> 11:11.671
the fates of all the women
in this colony?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.150
Just another vote

11:13.150 --> 11:15.239
where we put an X
next to our position?

11:15.239 --> 11:17.067
I thought we were here
to do more than that.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.329
You mean talk more about

11:18.329 --> 11:19.374
forgiving the men
and doing nothing.

11:19.374 --> 11:20.767
Everything else is insane.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.551
But none of you
will listen to reason.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.248
Well, why are you
here with us?

11:24.248 --> 11:25.685
Why are you still here with us
if that is what you believe?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.121
Just leave with the rest
of the do nothing women.

11:27.121 --> 11:30.080
She is my daughter
and I want her here with us.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.649
Is forgiveness
that's forced upon us

11:33.649 --> 11:34.737
true forgiveness?

11:36.957 --> 11:39.176
Keep nonsense
like that to yourself please.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.917
Autje, get down!

11:40.917 --> 11:42.919
Autje,
listen to your mother!

11:43.615 --> 11:44.791
Behave yourself.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.575
Don't you hear
the rafter's creaking?

11:46.575 --> 11:48.446
Do you want
the roof to cave in?

11:52.450 --> 11:54.191
Many of us
saw ourselves from above.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.847
I'm not sure if it was God

11:57.847 --> 12:00.545
and we were seeing ourselves
through his eyes.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.375
Or if we
just couldn't be there.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.815
In our own bodies.

12:12.775 --> 12:13.950
How'd you
get up there?

12:13.950 --> 12:15.386
It was a miracle.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.737
A miracle from God.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.347
-  Of course.
-  What else?

12:20.348 --> 12:22.393
Where I come from,

12:22.393 --> 12:24.134
where your mother comes from,

12:25.309 --> 12:28.443
we didn't talk
about our bodies.

12:28.443 --> 12:29.966
So when something
like this happened

12:29.966 --> 12:32.534
there was no language for it.

12:32.534 --> 12:36.277
And without language for it,
there was a gaping silence.

12:38.061 --> 12:41.108
And in that gaping silence
was the real horror.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.262
Neitje's mother hanged herself

13:48.262 --> 13:50.960
after the attacks
had gone on for a while.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.051
It made us wonder,

13:55.051 --> 13:56.879
why did our feet
keep moving forward

13:56.879 --> 13:58.446
when hers just couldn't.

13:59.577 --> 14:00.883
What sets us apart

14:00.883 --> 14:02.711
from the ones
who get left behind?

14:07.455 --> 14:09.283
This is never going to end.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.067
We'll be dead
and they'll still be talking.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.547
Or worse.
We'll have to live through it.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.464
August, I think
you should make lists

14:16.464 --> 14:18.683
of the pros and cons
of both options.

14:18.683 --> 14:21.077
"Staying and fighting"
and "leaving."

14:24.559 --> 14:26.082
Post it on the wall.

14:29.607 --> 14:30.913
Make sure and write large.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.045
Why?

14:32.045 --> 14:33.916
We can't read it.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.352
No, but we'll keep it here
as an artifact

14:35.352 --> 14:37.093
for others to discover.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.792
I think the first heading
should say,

14:40.792 --> 14:43.230
"staying and fighting"
and under that write "pros".

14:43.230 --> 14:45.232
Who will go first?

14:45.232 --> 14:47.364
We're starting with
staying and fighting, pros.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.714
Why do we need this?
This is our home.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.326
That's what you believe,

14:52.326 --> 14:54.067
it's not what
everyone believes.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.285
- Excuse me.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.026
Forgive me.
Excuse me, um...

14:57.026 --> 14:59.942
May I request that you
take it in turns speaking

14:59.942 --> 15:02.553
so that I can understand
what each of you is saying.

15:02.553 --> 15:03.772
It takes me
a second to transcribe.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.208
Should we put up our hands

15:05.208 --> 15:06.775
as though we are children
in your schoolhouse?

15:08.037 --> 15:09.212
I...

15:09.212 --> 15:10.953
I apologize.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.129
We won't have to leave.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.783
- Sorry.
- Will you just write it down?

15:15.523 --> 15:16.698
Under pros.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.961
Salome has had
a brilliant idea

15:18.961 --> 15:20.963
that if we stay
we won't have to leave.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.486
We won't
have to figure out

15:22.486 --> 15:24.097
where we are going
or experience the uncertainty

15:24.097 --> 15:26.360
of not knowing
where we are going.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.448
We don't have a map.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.884
That's absurd.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.494
The only certainty we'll know
is uncertainty,

15:30.494 --> 15:32.279
no matter where we are.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.758
Neitje? Autje?

15:33.758 --> 15:35.935
Do you have something
to add to the list?

15:37.632 --> 15:39.634
We won't have
to leave the people we love.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.723
Well, we could bring
our loved ones

15:41.723 --> 15:43.290
with us if we leave.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.944
How?

15:44.944 --> 15:47.598
What does that mean?
That we move the whole colony?

15:47.598 --> 15:49.165
What could that possibly mean?

15:49.165 --> 15:51.559
We could create
the possibility of a new order

15:51.559 --> 15:54.997
right here in a place
that is familiar to us.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.826
Not simply familiar,
but a place that is ours.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.480
Do we need
to write the cons?

15:59.480 --> 16:02.048
Isn't it obvious
that we must stay and fight?

16:02.048 --> 16:04.833
Cons. We won't be forgiven.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.444
May I say something?

16:08.489 --> 16:09.707
Please.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.144
Would it be a good idea
before we list

16:11.144 --> 16:13.015
the pros and cons
of "staying and fighting"

16:13.015 --> 16:14.712
to talk about
exactly what it is

16:14.712 --> 16:15.975
we're fighting for?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.411
It's obvious.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.629
We are fighting for our safety

16:18.629 --> 16:19.935
and for our freedom
from attacks.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.590
But what would
that mean to us?

16:22.590 --> 16:24.374
Perhaps we need a statement
which describes

16:24.374 --> 16:25.767
what we want the colony
to be like

16:25.767 --> 16:27.682
after winning the fight.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.162
Perhaps we need
to understand more

16:29.162 --> 16:30.728
what it is
we are fighting to achieve,

16:30.728 --> 16:33.296
not only what we are fighting
to destroy.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.734
Are we staying
or are we going?

16:39.389 --> 16:40.782
Ona, please tell us more

16:40.782 --> 16:43.002
about the statement
you're thinking about.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.397
Men and women would make

16:47.397 --> 16:50.009
all decisions
for the colony collectively.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.751
Women would be
allowed to think.

16:53.751 --> 16:57.451
Girls will be taught
to read and to write.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.670
The schoolhouse must display
a map of the world

16:59.670 --> 17:03.022
so that we can begin
to understand our place in it.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.198
A new religion,
taken from the old

17:05.198 --> 17:07.026
but focused on love

17:08.462 --> 17:10.942
would be created
by the women of the colony.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.771
Our children would be safe.

17:17.558 --> 17:18.994
"Collectively."

17:22.563 --> 17:24.565
You sound
like August's mother.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.703
Ona, you're a dreamer.

17:33.748 --> 17:36.055
We're women without a voice.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.447
We have nothing to return to.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.406
Even the animals
are safer in their homes

17:39.406 --> 17:41.321
than we women are.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.584
All we have are our dreams.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.499
So of course we are dreamers.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.415
And you want to hear my dream?

17:51.461 --> 17:53.594
I dream that people
who speak nonsense,

17:53.594 --> 17:55.117
who have no grasp on reality,

17:55.117 --> 17:57.337
are not put in charge
of making statements.

17:59.513 --> 18:02.037
What if the men
refuse to meet our demands?

18:03.995 --> 18:05.084
Sorry.

18:09.566 --> 18:10.698
We'll kill them.

18:11.916 --> 18:12.917
No, Ona.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.147
What if the men
who are in prison

18:25.147 --> 18:26.148
are not guilty?

18:29.499 --> 18:30.544
Mother?

18:30.544 --> 18:31.719
Autje.

18:31.719 --> 18:32.850
Why are you asking
if they're...?

18:32.850 --> 18:34.156
Autje, shush.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.331
We caught one of them.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.117
I saw him.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.553
But only one.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.163
Yes, only one,
but he named the others.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.904
But what if he was lying?

18:45.254 --> 18:46.647
We must consider this.

18:46.647 --> 18:49.911
No! That is not
our responsibility

18:49.911 --> 18:51.173
because we aren't in charge

18:51.173 --> 18:53.697
of whether or not
they are punished.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.482
We know that
we've been attacked by men.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.571
Not by ghosts or Satan

18:57.571 --> 18:59.312
as we were led to believe
for so long.

18:59.312 --> 19:02.663
We know that we've not
imagined these attacks.

19:02.663 --> 19:05.666
That we were made unconscious
with cow tranquilizer.

19:05.666 --> 19:09.104
We know that we are bruised,
and infected,

19:09.104 --> 19:12.629
and pregnant, and terrified,
and insane,

19:12.629 --> 19:14.805
and some of us are dead.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.199
We know that
we must protect our children.

19:17.199 --> 19:20.463
Regardless of who is guilty.

19:20.463 --> 19:24.119
All right, Salome. Thank you.
Please, sit down, hmm.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.556
Hmm.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.276
Shall we move on?

19:52.278 --> 19:53.844
It is possible
the men in prison

19:53.844 --> 19:55.324
are not guilty of the attacks,

19:55.324 --> 19:58.022
but are they guilty
of not stopping the attacks?

19:58.022 --> 19:59.241
Are they guilty of knowing

19:59.241 --> 20:00.764
about the attacks
and doing nothing?

20:00.764 --> 20:02.244
How should we know
what they're guilty of or not?

20:02.244 --> 20:03.811
But we do know.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.248
We do know that the conditions
have been created by men

20:06.248 --> 20:08.642
and that these attacks
have been made possible

20:08.642 --> 20:11.384
because of the circumstances
of the colony.

20:11.384 --> 20:12.733
And those circumstances

20:12.733 --> 20:15.257
have been created
and ordained by the men.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.172
But wait,
aren't you suggesting

20:17.172 --> 20:19.870
that the attackers
are as much victims

20:19.870 --> 20:22.482
as the victims of the attacks?

20:22.482 --> 20:24.353
That all of us,
men and women

20:24.353 --> 20:26.181
are victims
of the circumstances

20:26.181 --> 20:28.314
from which the colony
has been created.

20:32.013 --> 20:33.623
In a sense, yes.

20:33.623 --> 20:36.931
So then, even if the court
finds them guilty or innocent,

20:38.193 --> 20:40.326
they are...

20:40.326 --> 20:42.110
after all innocent.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.201
Yes, I would say so.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.250
- The elders called them evil.
-  That's not true.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.555
It's the elder's
quest for power

20:52.555 --> 20:53.861
that is responsible.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.036
Because they needed
to have those...

20:55.036 --> 20:56.646
Those they'd have power over.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.169
And those people are us.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.867
And they have taught
the lesson of power

20:59.867 --> 21:01.695
to the boys and men
of the colony,

21:01.695 --> 21:04.959
and the boys and men
have been excellent students.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.267
Don't we all
want some sort of power?

21:09.093 --> 21:10.269
I think so.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.227
But I'm not sure.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.708
But we caught them.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.666
We caught them.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.757
Yes, you did.

21:20.757 --> 21:23.282
Then why are you
making it so complicated?

21:23.282 --> 21:26.285
This is very, very boring.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.897
We could ask the men to leave.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.293
Ask the men to leave?

21:37.774 --> 21:41.082
None of us have ever
asked the men for anything.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.649
Not a single thing.

21:44.041 --> 21:47.044
Not even for
the salt to be passed.

21:47.044 --> 21:50.613
Not even for a penny,
or a moment alone.

21:50.613 --> 21:54.095
Or to take the washing in,
or to open a curtain,

21:54.095 --> 21:57.272
or to go easy
on the small yearlings.

21:57.272 --> 21:59.927
Or to put your hand
on the small of my back

21:59.927 --> 22:03.191
while I try again
for the 12th or 13th time

22:03.191 --> 22:05.759
to push a baby out of my body.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.242
Isn't it interesting

22:11.242 --> 22:15.377
that the one and only request
we women would have of the men

22:15.377 --> 22:17.292
would be for them to leave?

22:30.914 --> 22:33.830
Asking the men to leave
is not an option.

22:34.265 --> 22:35.310
Oh!

22:37.051 --> 22:39.358
I'd like you to imagine
Ruth and Cheryl.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.620
No. Not again.

22:43.318 --> 22:44.493
Please stop.

22:45.712 --> 22:48.236
Look. August is still
taking the minutes.

22:50.020 --> 22:53.415
I can't believe August
is still taking the minutes.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.811
Sometimes I think
people laugh

22:57.811 --> 22:59.726
as hard as they'd like to cry.

23:02.903 --> 23:05.688
August, you must think
we're all lunatics.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.125
I don't.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.737
And it doesn't matter
what I think, anyway.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.435
Is that true?

23:13.435 --> 23:15.045
Do you really think it doesn't
matter what you think?

23:19.136 --> 23:21.704
How would you feel
if in your entire life

23:21.704 --> 23:23.532
it never mattered
what you thought?

23:25.621 --> 23:27.971
But I'm not here to think.

23:27.971 --> 23:31.018
I'm here to take the minutes
of your meeting.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.281
But if in your entire life
you truly felt

23:33.281 --> 23:35.196
it didn't matter
what you thought,

23:35.196 --> 23:36.893
how would that make you feel?

23:47.295 --> 23:48.644
When we've
liberated ourselves,

23:48.644 --> 23:51.168
we will have to ask ourselves
who we are.

24:35.735 --> 24:37.476
Will we be done
by supper time?

24:37.476 --> 24:40.130
I have to give
little Miep her antibiotics.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.784
Where did you get antibiotics?

24:43.438 --> 24:44.613
She walked.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.137
She walked for
a day and a half

24:47.137 --> 24:49.096
to the mobile clinic

24:49.096 --> 24:51.098
with Miep on her back.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.497
The Lord is gracious
and compassionate,

24:58.497 --> 25:00.324
slow to anger,

25:00.324 --> 25:02.892
rich in loving
kindness and forgiveness.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.592
The Lord is gracious
and compassionate,

25:06.592 --> 25:08.115
slow to anger,

25:08.115 --> 25:11.901
rich in loving
kindness and forgiveness.

25:11.901 --> 25:14.643
The Lord is gracious
and compassionate,

25:14.643 --> 25:16.297
slow to anger,

25:16.297 --> 25:20.431
rich in loving
kindness and forgiveness.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.695
I have to hide the antibiotics
in Miep's applesauce

25:22.695 --> 25:24.566
or she won't swallow them.

25:27.917 --> 25:30.050
The Lord is gracious
and compassionate,

25:30.050 --> 25:31.791
slow to anger,

25:31.791 --> 25:35.751
rich in loving
kindness and forgiveness.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.058
The Lord is gracious
and compassionate,

25:38.058 --> 25:39.842
slow to anger,

25:39.842 --> 25:43.454
rich in loving
kindness and forgiveness.

25:43.454 --> 25:46.370
The Lord is gracious
and compassionate,

25:46.370 --> 25:47.850
slow to anger,

25:47.850 --> 25:50.853
rich in loving
kindness and forgiveness.

25:50.853 --> 25:53.856
The Lord is gracious
and compassionate,

25:53.856 --> 25:54.944
slow to anger...

25:55.815 --> 25:57.686
Forgive me.

25:57.686 --> 25:59.645
They're too big for my mouth.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.777
The Lord is gracious
and compassionate,

26:01.777 --> 26:03.344
slow to anger,

26:03.344 --> 26:05.825
rich in loving
kindness and forgiveness.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.307
The Lord is gracious
and compassionate,

26:10.307 --> 26:13.615
slow to anger, rich in loving
kindness and forgiveness.

26:20.927 --> 26:23.407
Well, let's take a break.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.507
- Melvin.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.077
You're it.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.483
Not one word
about my smoking.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.703
Honestly, I'm sick of it.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.530
Okay,
I'm coming over here.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.664
Watch out!

27:02.664 --> 27:04.753
Is she always
going to be like this now?

27:06.886 --> 27:07.887
Like what?

27:09.062 --> 27:10.585
A man.

27:10.585 --> 27:12.631
Is Nettie always
going to be a man now?

27:19.159 --> 27:21.291
Later,
we understood that Nettie

27:21.291 --> 27:23.816
didn't become a man
because of what happened.

27:25.774 --> 27:27.950
Nettie had never
felt like a woman.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.259
Now pretending
had become impossible.

27:47.187 --> 27:48.971
Is my brother listening?

27:55.151 --> 27:56.631
Hello, little brother.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.898
I don't know
if the baby was yours,

28:02.898 --> 28:05.684
or if it was
one of your friends.

28:08.382 --> 28:10.993
I think it
was likely yours though...

28:13.430 --> 28:15.476
because there was something
wrong with it.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.352
I loved it.

28:23.614 --> 28:24.877
I think.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.491
Isn't that strange?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.371
I won't speak of it.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.157
Or anything else.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.943
Ever again.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.604
But...

28:56.604 --> 28:57.779
But what?

28:57.779 --> 29:00.042
She doesn't
speak anymore.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.217
You all right?

29:01.217 --> 29:02.610
She speaks
to the children.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.525
Kind of.

29:04.525 --> 29:06.309
I think they call her Melvin.

29:26.329 --> 29:30.725
You know, during
the Second World War in Italy,

29:30.725 --> 29:33.510
civilians would hide
in bomb shelters.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.730
Volunteers were needed

29:35.730 --> 29:38.777
to power the generators
that provided electricity.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.736
They rode bikes.

29:44.130 --> 29:47.089
And when you were swinging
from the rafter earlier,

29:47.089 --> 29:50.614
I was, uh, reminded of this.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.616
You would have been
the perfect volunteer.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.490
If we were in a bomb shelter.

29:58.709 --> 30:01.190
Where would I ride the bike to
in such a small space?

30:01.190 --> 30:04.324
Oh, well, uh,
the bike would be stationary.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.505
I have to get the water
to the horses.

30:18.512 --> 30:19.774
Watch this.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.827
Oh!

30:32.091 --> 30:33.788
I'll bet you didn't learn
how to do things like that

30:33.788 --> 30:35.834
when you went to university.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.879
Only facts about
stationary bicycles

30:37.879 --> 30:39.359
in far off places.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.798
I suppose I shouldn't be
too sad then.

30:44.494 --> 30:45.931
That I won't ever go.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.895
Why were you forced
to leave the colony?

30:53.895 --> 30:55.854
My mother questioned things.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.291
She questioned God?

30:58.944 --> 31:00.336
Not God.

31:00.336 --> 31:01.381
Power.

31:02.469 --> 31:05.733
The rules made
in the name of God.

31:05.733 --> 31:09.432
And she encouraged others
to question things too.

31:09.432 --> 31:10.912
Like Ona?

31:10.912 --> 31:11.913
Yes.

31:13.132 --> 31:14.916
Ona knew her well.

31:16.309 --> 31:17.745
Did she die?

31:29.888 --> 31:31.193
But sometimes,

31:31.193 --> 31:32.716
listening to you all
speaking today

31:32.716 --> 31:35.284
I can hear her so clearly.

31:38.113 --> 31:40.594
Why did the elders
let you come back?

31:40.594 --> 31:42.596
Well, I went to university

31:42.596 --> 31:46.121
so I could serve a purpose
and teach the boys.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.384
Too late.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.009
I want to help.

32:05.445 --> 32:06.925
And I don't know how.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.493
You came back for Ona,
didn't you?

32:11.755 --> 32:13.496
The way you look at her is

32:14.758 --> 32:15.759
funny.

32:17.196 --> 32:19.372
I don't know why
she won't just marry you.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.591
You both say so much
that doesn't make sense.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.352
Mama.

32:46.051 --> 32:47.661
All residents, please come out

32:47.661 --> 32:49.010
of your homes to be counted
for the 2010 census.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.186
Hey, hey, hey.
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

32:51.186 --> 32:52.796
Away. Away!

32:55.974 --> 32:57.714
Please come out
and be counted now.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.064
Please come out of your homes

32:59.064 --> 33:01.109
to be counted
for the 2010 census.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.430
All residents must come out
of their homes

33:17.430 --> 33:20.041
to be counted
for the 2010 census.

33:28.484 --> 33:29.529
Whoo!

33:38.364 --> 33:41.019
All right.
You want to try this one?

33:44.500 --> 33:46.067
This is the 2010 census.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.416
Please come out of your homes

33:47.416 --> 33:49.549
to be counted
for the 2010 census.

33:55.468 --> 33:57.209
- Tickle, tickle, tickle.

34:10.526 --> 34:13.486
I'm here to collect data
for the 2010 census.

34:13.486 --> 34:15.096
Please come out
of your homes now

34:15.096 --> 34:16.271
to be counted.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.102
Let's go.

34:21.102 --> 34:22.364
Why?

34:22.364 --> 34:23.800
Let's just... Let's go.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.080
The ladies standing
in front of me.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.125
- How old are you?

34:44.125 --> 34:46.040
- I'm 15.
- I'm 16.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.129
Okay.
So you must have boyfriends.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.522
Oh!

34:49.522 --> 34:50.523
- No. We don't have boyfriends.
- No boyfriend?

34:53.743 --> 34:55.136
I'll see
you ladies again.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.572
- Mm-hmm
-  Take care.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.855
Well, we must
begin without her.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.164
Thank you.

36:07.991 --> 36:09.645
Were you smoking?

36:09.645 --> 36:10.907
Is that any of your business?

36:10.907 --> 36:12.126
Please.

36:16.739 --> 36:19.481
I can't live
a second longer!

36:19.481 --> 36:20.787
Autje!

36:27.141 --> 36:28.621
-  Autje!

36:32.102 --> 36:33.713
Autje, wait until
I get ahold of you.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.672
The census taker just told us

36:36.672 --> 36:37.760
that one of our men
is returning

36:37.760 --> 36:40.502
from the city late tonight.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.461
They need more bail money
for the attackers.

36:42.461 --> 36:43.549
Which man?

36:45.072 --> 36:46.160
Your Klaas.

36:47.335 --> 36:49.250
So time
is of the essence.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.947
Everyone get back
to your seats.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.562
August, please,
pros for leaving.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.173
Pros for leaving.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.047
We will be gone.

37:04.047 --> 37:05.440
We will be safe.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.702
Maybe not.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.095
The first is most
definitely a fact,

37:08.095 --> 37:09.662
that if we leave
we will be gone.

37:09.662 --> 37:11.838
Do we really need to state
the obvious over and over?

37:13.492 --> 37:14.667
Yes, Autje.

37:15.929 --> 37:18.497
We will see
a bit of the world.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.020
Let's move on
to the cons of leaving.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.151
We, the women, will decide

37:21.151 --> 37:23.023
what happens
in these meetings.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.896
Not a two-bit failed farmer
who must teach.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.637
You have been invited here.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.291
You have been invited
here to listen

37:30.291 --> 37:32.859
to what we have to say
and write it down.

37:32.859 --> 37:35.731
Nothing more.
Just listen.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.342
Mariche!

37:37.342 --> 37:40.910
Klaas will be returning soon
and you are wasting time.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.912
He will come to your house
just long enough

37:42.912 --> 37:46.394
to take his animals in order
to sell for bail money

37:46.394 --> 37:49.397
that will see the rapists
return to the colony

37:49.397 --> 37:50.833
and he will lay his hands

37:50.833 --> 37:53.619
on you and on your children.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.535
And you, as always,
do nothing,

37:56.535 --> 37:59.799
but fire away at us
with all of this rage.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.542
I would like to apologize

38:03.542 --> 38:05.761
for wrongly attempting
to nudge the proceedings.

38:07.546 --> 38:09.025
That's not my place.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.380
Mejal!

38:20.733 --> 38:21.908
I'll stop.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.780
Mama.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.657
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

38:33.049 --> 38:34.573
What is it? Hmm?

38:38.185 --> 38:39.926
Miep, what is it?

38:41.014 --> 38:42.798
I hurt.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.194
It's all right.

38:49.631 --> 38:50.980
It's all right.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.075
It's all right.

39:06.039 --> 39:08.215
There are no cons of leaving.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.045
It's all right.

40:34.301 --> 40:35.955
If we do leave the colony,

40:35.955 --> 40:38.436
how will we live with the pain
of never seeing our brothers

40:38.436 --> 40:39.915
and our sons again?

40:41.177 --> 40:42.352
The men?

40:57.542 --> 40:58.499
Time will heal.

41:01.067 --> 41:05.114
Our freedom and safety
are the ultimate goals.

41:05.114 --> 41:08.466
And it is men who prevent us
from achieving those goals.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.470
But not all men.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.488
Perhaps not men,

41:30.488 --> 41:32.359
but a way of seeing the world,
and us women,

41:32.359 --> 41:33.665
which has been allowed
to take hold

41:33.665 --> 41:35.623
of men's hearts and minds.

41:38.713 --> 41:41.194
So if we leave...
if we leave

41:41.194 --> 41:43.283
I will never see
my brothers again?

41:44.980 --> 41:46.504
Who will
take care of them?

41:47.635 --> 41:48.897
Of them all?

41:50.333 --> 41:52.379
We can't know
if we will stay or leave

41:52.379 --> 41:53.859
before we resolve

41:53.859 --> 41:56.339
these last-minute concerns.

41:57.819 --> 41:59.995
I wouldn't call
the future of our relationship

41:59.995 --> 42:02.737
with the boys and men we love
"last-minute concerns."

42:28.981 --> 42:30.199
There we go.

42:43.909 --> 42:48.609
It was all waiting
to happen before it happened.

42:48.609 --> 42:50.524
You could look back
and follow the breadcrumbs

42:50.524 --> 42:52.831
along the path
that led to violence.

42:53.701 --> 42:55.616
When we looked back,

42:55.616 --> 42:58.358
we could see
that it had been everywhere,

42:58.358 --> 43:00.403
whether it was happening yet
or not.

43:01.361 --> 43:03.581
Hi.

43:16.071 --> 43:17.290
Hi.

43:30.999 --> 43:32.610
I'll get you some water.

43:44.056 --> 43:45.797
There's no cup or anything.

44:16.305 --> 44:18.351
It's good
that you're here, August.

44:20.179 --> 44:22.355
To remind us
of what's possible.

44:24.226 --> 44:25.967
Because it's easy to forget.

44:34.846 --> 44:36.064
I'm so sorry, Ona.

44:39.764 --> 44:40.939
One day I'd like to hear that

44:40.939 --> 44:42.767
from someone
who should be saying it.

44:55.736 --> 44:57.129
Why does love...

44:58.217 --> 45:00.567
The absence of love,
the end of love,

45:00.567 --> 45:02.090
the need for love,

45:03.048 --> 45:05.224
result in so much violence?

45:11.621 --> 45:12.622
Ona.

45:14.799 --> 45:15.756
Ona.

45:18.454 --> 45:20.282
I could take care of you

45:20.848 --> 45:22.154
and your child.

45:25.592 --> 45:26.593
I would like to.

45:30.728 --> 45:31.816
I, um...

45:31.816 --> 45:33.774
I know,

45:33.774 --> 45:35.036
but you don't have
to say the words.

45:38.170 --> 45:40.912
If I were married,
I wouldn't be myself.

45:41.956 --> 45:43.741
So the person you love
would be gone.

45:56.362 --> 45:57.798
Your child...

46:01.410 --> 46:02.629
If we stay
and we don't win the fight,

46:02.629 --> 46:04.413
my child will be given

46:05.371 --> 46:07.112
to another family here.

46:08.722 --> 46:10.898
Maybe even the family
of my attacker.

46:13.335 --> 46:15.250
If we stay
and don't win the fight.

46:19.515 --> 46:21.387
You won't let that happen. No.

46:21.953 --> 46:22.954
No.

46:24.869 --> 46:26.131
No, I won't.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.850
August,
we need to discuss options

46:49.850 --> 46:51.373
for the men
and the older boys,

46:51.373 --> 46:52.853
if the women decide to leave.

46:52.853 --> 46:54.724
Which is a waste of time
because we're not leaving.

46:54.724 --> 46:56.596
The men should leave with us
if they wish.

46:56.596 --> 46:58.337
Then what on earth
is the point of us leaving?

46:58.337 --> 47:00.295
Well, they could be allowed
to join the women later

47:00.295 --> 47:02.167
once the women
have established themselves

47:02.167 --> 47:03.951
and are thriving.

47:03.951 --> 47:05.431
Should we add

47:05.431 --> 47:08.608
"thriving as a collective,
literate community"?

47:08.608 --> 47:10.305
Literate's your word.
Not ours.

47:10.305 --> 47:11.785
We don't need your university
language to make our plans.

47:11.785 --> 47:13.526
Put it in.
We know what it means.

47:13.526 --> 47:14.962
Continue, Greta.

47:14.962 --> 47:17.225
Young boys,
simple-minded boys of any age,

47:17.225 --> 47:19.706
Cornelius who's confined
to a wheelchair,

47:19.706 --> 47:20.881
will accompany the women.

47:20.881 --> 47:22.796
I vote for the first option.

47:22.796 --> 47:24.406
The men should leave with us
if they wish.

47:24.406 --> 47:25.668
The first option is ridiculous

47:25.668 --> 47:27.322
and should be
crossed off the list.

47:27.322 --> 47:28.410
Why are some ideas
written down and considered,

47:28.410 --> 47:30.325
and others crossed out?

47:32.110 --> 47:34.721
I want to leave.
I'd like to strangle myself.

47:34.721 --> 47:35.896
Mariche, it's possible
that all the men

47:35.896 --> 47:37.376
would choose to leave with us.

47:37.376 --> 47:39.378
And then all we'd be doing
is recreating our colony

47:39.378 --> 47:40.814
with all of its
dangers elsewhere.

47:40.814 --> 47:41.946
And the men
would definitely

47:41.946 --> 47:43.295
leave with us because

47:43.295 --> 47:44.687
they can't survive without us.

47:44.687 --> 47:45.950
Well, not for longer
than a day or two.

47:45.950 --> 47:47.168
We have not
decided to leave.

47:47.168 --> 47:48.735
I'd like to remind everyone
of that.

47:48.735 --> 47:50.519
And how can we leave
at all if we've never

47:50.519 --> 47:52.957
been allowed to even see
a map of the world?

47:52.957 --> 47:55.611
I can secure
a world map for you.

47:55.611 --> 47:59.485
I also have a, um,
map of this specific region.

47:59.485 --> 48:01.052
Well, that will do.

48:01.052 --> 48:03.445
It's not like we are planning
to travel the planet.

48:03.445 --> 48:05.012
Perhaps we are.

48:05.012 --> 48:06.361
Did you know
that the migration period

48:06.361 --> 48:08.668
for butterflies
and dragonflies is so long

48:08.668 --> 48:10.191
that it's often
only the grandchildren

48:10.191 --> 48:12.498
that arrive
at the intended destination?

48:14.239 --> 48:15.805
Yes. So, it...

48:17.938 --> 48:19.374
Yes.

48:19.374 --> 48:21.376
Perhaps, if we went beyond
where the map showed us,

48:21.376 --> 48:24.075
we could create
our own map as we go.

48:24.075 --> 48:26.033
So now you want to leave, Ona?

48:31.778 --> 48:33.649
Are you all right,
Mejal?

48:36.957 --> 48:39.351
Nope. She's having
one of her episodes.

48:41.353 --> 48:43.224
Father Almighty,

48:43.224 --> 48:45.966
in all humility
and supplication we ask Thee

48:45.966 --> 48:47.489
for Thy abundant kindness

48:48.055 --> 48:49.404
at this moment.

48:49.404 --> 48:51.537
We beseech Thee

48:51.537 --> 48:54.975
to have mercy
on our sister Mejal.

48:54.975 --> 48:57.412
- Please, in your beneficence,

48:57.412 --> 48:59.197
heal her.

48:59.197 --> 49:01.373
- And please...

49:01.373 --> 49:04.680
...we ask of Thee, envelop her

49:04.680 --> 49:07.509
in your strength
and everlasting love,

49:07.509 --> 49:09.163
and please drive out
the sickness

49:09.163 --> 49:11.035
which afflicts her now.

49:28.530 --> 49:29.967
Help me up.

49:29.967 --> 49:31.925
Praise be to God.

49:36.147 --> 49:37.539
Why is it
only Mejal has these...?

49:37.539 --> 49:38.714
Be quiet.

49:38.714 --> 49:39.889
We were all attacked.

49:40.847 --> 49:41.979
Not all of us need to draw

49:41.979 --> 49:43.676
so much attention
to ourselves.

49:47.419 --> 49:49.029
What attention?

49:49.029 --> 49:50.204
I speak less
than all of you put together.

49:50.204 --> 49:51.379
How have I offended you?

49:51.379 --> 49:53.381
You have
these attacks.

49:53.381 --> 49:55.644
You smoke.

49:55.644 --> 49:59.213
Why? Why is it so much
harder for you than for us?

49:59.213 --> 50:01.346
We were all attacked.
All of us.

50:01.346 --> 50:05.002
We are wasting our time
by passing this burden,

50:05.002 --> 50:07.178
this sack of stones,
from one to the next,

50:07.178 --> 50:10.094
by pushing our pain away.

50:10.094 --> 50:13.401
Let's absorb it ourselves.
Let's inhale it.

50:13.401 --> 50:14.489
Let's digest it.

50:15.273 --> 50:17.797
Let's process it into fuel.

50:23.368 --> 50:24.891
Speak, Mejal.

50:25.631 --> 50:26.936
We are listening.

50:31.028 --> 50:33.160
They made us
disbelieve ourselves.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.473
That was worse than...

50:44.824 --> 50:46.043
Mejal.

50:54.703 --> 50:55.791
Klaas, when he returns,

50:55.791 --> 50:57.402
may take horses or livestock

50:57.402 --> 50:58.664
that we would need
along the way.

50:58.664 --> 51:00.231
Along the way?

51:00.231 --> 51:01.536
We're not leaving.

51:05.018 --> 51:06.976
You are changing
your mind, Ona.

51:06.976 --> 51:09.240
I don't believe
that's a sin, is it?

51:11.155 --> 51:13.853
How will
we be forgiven for all this?

51:13.853 --> 51:15.985
How will we be forgiven,

51:15.985 --> 51:18.727
if not by the elders
whom we have disobeyed?

51:18.727 --> 51:22.035
Perhaps there will be
other elders or men of God

51:22.035 --> 51:23.819
who will be able
to forgive our sins.

51:23.819 --> 51:26.474
We do not need to be forgiven
by the men of God

51:26.474 --> 51:27.823
for protecting our children

51:27.823 --> 51:29.173
from the depraved actions
of vicious men

51:29.173 --> 51:30.435
who are often
the very same men

51:30.435 --> 51:32.350
we're meant to ask
for forgiveness!

51:34.178 --> 51:36.658
If God is a loving God then...

51:36.658 --> 51:38.225
He will forgive us himself.

51:39.574 --> 51:40.793
If God is a vengeful God

51:40.793 --> 51:42.751
then He has created us
in His image.

51:44.623 --> 51:46.842
If God is omnipotent,

51:46.842 --> 51:48.540
then why has He not protected

51:48.540 --> 51:50.803
the women and girls
of this colony?

51:55.982 --> 51:58.245
I will destroy

51:58.245 --> 52:02.075
any living thing
that harms my child.

52:04.991 --> 52:07.298
I will tear it limb from limb.

52:08.168 --> 52:10.170
I will desecrate its body

52:10.170 --> 52:12.172
and I will bury it alive.

52:13.478 --> 52:14.957
I will challenge God
on the spot

52:14.957 --> 52:16.133
to strike me dead

52:16.133 --> 52:17.308
if I have sinned

52:17.308 --> 52:19.745
by protecting my child
from evil,

52:19.745 --> 52:22.835
and by destroying that evil
that it may not harm another!

52:23.792 --> 52:25.533
I will lie,

52:26.708 --> 52:28.797
I will hunt, I will kill.

52:28.797 --> 52:30.495
I will dance on graves

52:30.495 --> 52:33.106
and I will burn
forever in hell

52:33.106 --> 52:35.239
before I allow another man

52:35.239 --> 52:37.066
to satisfy his violent urges

52:37.066 --> 52:39.982
with the body
of my four-year-old child!

53:08.620 --> 53:11.449
I suggest we think
about what is good.

53:13.712 --> 53:15.279
"Whatever is true,

53:16.280 --> 53:18.107
"whatever is honorable,

53:19.108 --> 53:20.719
"whatever is just,

53:21.633 --> 53:23.374
"whatever is pure,

53:23.374 --> 53:25.767
"whatever is pleasing,

53:25.767 --> 53:27.639
"whatever is commendable,

53:28.466 --> 53:30.729
"if there is any excellence

53:30.729 --> 53:34.080
"and if there
is anything worthy of praise,

53:34.080 --> 53:36.865
"think about these things

53:36.865 --> 53:40.173
"and the peace of God
be with you."

53:42.306 --> 53:44.525
I will become a murderer
if I stay.

54:21.345 --> 54:23.434
I know what these are.
These are letters.

54:23.434 --> 54:25.262
But what are these?

54:25.262 --> 54:28.003
They're commas.

54:28.003 --> 54:31.529
They signify a short pause,
or a breath in the text.

54:35.141 --> 54:37.186
There's also a butterfly
called a comma.

54:38.449 --> 54:40.146
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

55:00.166 --> 55:01.341
-  Salome.

55:03.735 --> 55:07.565
If you will become a murderer
by staying here in the colony,

55:07.565 --> 55:09.088
side by side with the men

55:09.088 --> 55:11.351
who are responsible
for the attacks,

55:12.396 --> 55:13.614
then you must,

55:15.573 --> 55:17.357
to protect your own soul,

55:18.053 --> 55:19.751
leave the colony.

55:21.013 --> 55:22.623
We are not all murderers.

55:22.623 --> 55:23.929
Not yet.

55:23.929 --> 55:25.278
I have done
what the verse

55:25.278 --> 55:26.845
from Philippians instructed,

55:26.845 --> 55:29.195
which is to think
about what is good,

55:30.152 --> 55:32.198
what is just, what is pure,

55:32.198 --> 55:33.547
what is excellent.

55:35.114 --> 55:36.463
Pacifism.

55:39.205 --> 55:40.946
Pacifism is good.

55:40.946 --> 55:42.164
Any violence

55:42.904 --> 55:44.515
is unjustifiable.

55:45.429 --> 55:49.694
By staying here, we women

55:49.694 --> 55:52.436
will be betraying
the central tenet of our faith

55:52.436 --> 55:53.828
which is pacifism,

55:56.004 --> 55:57.615
because by staying

55:59.921 --> 56:03.229
we will knowingly
be placing ourselves

56:04.535 --> 56:08.452
in a direct collision course
with violence,

56:10.149 --> 56:13.065
either by us or against us.

56:14.675 --> 56:19.071
This colony is the only home
I've ever known.

56:21.290 --> 56:23.249
And I don't want to leave.

56:23.945 --> 56:25.338
But by staying,

56:26.165 --> 56:27.993
we'll be inviting harm.

56:29.255 --> 56:31.257
We will be in a state of war.

56:31.257 --> 56:35.043
We will turn this colony
into a battlefield.

56:38.699 --> 56:40.962
We cannot
become murderers.

56:40.962 --> 56:43.487
And we cannot endure
any more violence,

56:45.706 --> 56:47.404
which is why we must leave.

57:09.643 --> 57:10.688
I've also been thinking

57:10.688 --> 57:13.647
about the verse
from Philippians

57:13.647 --> 57:15.867
and I've been thinking
about what is good.

57:17.259 --> 57:18.696
Freedom is good.

57:19.740 --> 57:21.786
It is better than slavery.

57:23.048 --> 57:24.789
Forgiveness is good.

57:25.790 --> 57:27.487
It's better than revenge.

57:28.706 --> 57:32.013
And hope for the unknown
is good,

57:32.013 --> 57:34.581
it is better than
hatred of the familiar.

57:34.581 --> 57:36.627
And what about security,

57:37.628 --> 57:40.544
and safety, and home,
and family?

57:41.675 --> 57:44.591
What about marriage,

57:46.724 --> 57:50.118
and love, Ona?

57:50.118 --> 57:52.599
I don't know
about those things,

57:52.599 --> 57:54.035
any of them.

57:55.036 --> 57:56.734
Except for love

57:57.778 --> 58:00.302
and... even love
is mysterious to me.

58:01.216 --> 58:02.566
And I believe that my home

58:02.566 --> 58:04.132
is with my mother,
and my sister,

58:04.132 --> 58:06.657
and my unborn child,
wherever that may be.

58:09.050 --> 58:11.183
Will you not hate that child?

58:14.403 --> 58:15.840
That child's the child
of a man

58:15.840 --> 58:17.581
who inspires
violent thoughts in you.

58:22.673 --> 58:25.240
I already love this child
more than anything.

58:26.590 --> 58:28.592
He or she
is as innocent and lovable

58:28.592 --> 58:30.115
as the evening sun.

58:30.115 --> 58:33.248
So too was the child's father
when he was born.

58:37.514 --> 58:38.776
But, if you're saying

58:38.776 --> 58:41.648
that forgiveness
is better than revenge...

58:43.781 --> 58:46.392
Aren't you saying
that we must stay here

58:46.392 --> 58:47.785
and forgive the men?

58:47.785 --> 58:50.831
We cannot forgive
because we are forced to.

58:53.399 --> 58:58.056
But, with some distance
perhaps I am able

58:59.927 --> 59:03.017
to understand how these crimes
may have occurred.

59:04.410 --> 59:06.238
And with that distance,

59:06.238 --> 59:08.719
maybe I am able
to pity these men,

59:10.459 --> 59:12.331
perhaps forgive them.

59:13.245 --> 59:15.029
And even love them.

59:17.379 --> 59:19.773
Not fighting. But moving.

59:20.687 --> 59:26.432
Always moving. Never fighting.
Just moving.

59:26.432 --> 59:29.957
Never fighting. Just moving.
Never fighting. Always moving.

59:29.957 --> 59:31.611
Would you snap out of it?

59:31.611 --> 59:32.743
You snap out of it.

59:32.743 --> 59:34.092
All of you
snap out of it.

59:34.092 --> 59:36.181
Have you lost your minds?
The sun is gone.

59:39.227 --> 59:42.404
I want to tell another story
about Ruth and Cheryl.

59:51.326 --> 59:52.719
I was always frightened

59:52.719 --> 59:55.548
of the northern road
out of the colony.

59:57.637 --> 1:00:00.205
There are so many gullies
on either side of the road.

1:00:03.991 --> 1:00:07.647
The buggy used to lurch
side to side.

1:00:07.647 --> 1:00:09.388
Ruth and Cheryl were simply

1:00:09.388 --> 1:00:11.433
following my commands
of the reins,

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:15.263
but, they were
jerky and frenetic.

1:00:15.263 --> 1:00:17.352
And it was dangerous.

1:00:19.616 --> 1:00:22.444
It was only when I learned
to focus my gaze

1:00:22.444 --> 1:00:25.099
far down ahead of me

1:00:25.099 --> 1:00:26.579
and not on the road

1:00:26.579 --> 1:00:28.712
immediately in front
of Ruth and Cheryl,

1:00:28.712 --> 1:00:30.888
that I started to feel safe.

1:00:39.897 --> 1:00:41.986
Leaving will give us

1:00:41.986 --> 1:00:44.858
the more farseeing perspective
we need

1:00:45.642 --> 1:00:47.034
to forgive.

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:55.434
Which is to love properly

1:00:55.434 --> 1:00:58.785
and keep the peace,
according to our faith.

1:01:00.352 --> 1:01:01.745
Therefore, our leaving

1:01:01.745 --> 1:01:04.486
wouldn't be
an act of cowardice

1:01:04.486 --> 1:01:05.749
or abandonment.

1:01:05.749 --> 1:01:06.837
Let's see you go.

1:01:06.837 --> 1:01:08.142
It wouldn't be because

1:01:08.142 --> 1:01:12.146
we were excommunicated
or exiled.

1:01:12.146 --> 1:01:15.062
It would be
a supreme act of faith...

1:01:15.062 --> 1:01:16.716
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1:01:16.716 --> 1:01:20.764
...a step towards
love and forgiveness.

1:01:25.029 --> 1:01:28.554
Leaving is how
we demonstrate our faith.

1:01:30.295 --> 1:01:31.644
We are leaving because

1:01:31.644 --> 1:01:34.821
our faith is stronger
than the rules.

1:01:38.738 --> 1:01:40.392
Bigger than our life.

1:02:04.372 --> 1:02:06.679
I'm sorry.
But I think I might be dying.

1:02:12.816 --> 1:02:15.688
Mother, you're not dying.

1:02:15.688 --> 1:02:17.734
Your glasses need cleaning.

1:02:23.391 --> 1:02:25.524
Why are you laughing?

1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:28.919
We cannot leave.

1:02:29.528 --> 1:02:31.486
We...

1:02:31.486 --> 1:02:34.272
It would be better
to stay and fight than leave.

1:02:34.272 --> 1:02:35.708
Do you really mean
that you want to stay

1:02:35.708 --> 1:02:38.015
and not fight?

1:02:38.015 --> 1:02:39.973
Because when was the last time
you had the strength

1:02:39.973 --> 1:02:41.845
to stand up
to the aggression of Klaas,

1:02:41.845 --> 1:02:43.455
to protect your children,

1:02:43.455 --> 1:02:45.544
- or to get out of harm's way?
-  Who are you

1:02:45.544 --> 1:02:47.502
to tell me what kind of
wife and mother to be

1:02:47.502 --> 1:02:48.939
when you are
neither one yourself?

1:02:48.939 --> 1:02:51.724
You are a spinster. A whore!

1:02:51.724 --> 1:02:53.160
- An unwed mother!
- Stop.

1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:54.248
Ona was
made unconscious

1:02:54.248 --> 1:02:55.423
and raped like the rest of us.

1:02:55.423 --> 1:02:57.861
How dare you call her a whore!

1:02:57.861 --> 1:02:59.906
Mariche, are you not afraid
that your own sweet boys

1:02:59.906 --> 1:03:01.299
will become monsters
like their father

1:03:01.299 --> 1:03:02.822
because you do nothing
to protect them?

1:03:02.822 --> 1:03:04.258
- Stop it!
- Nothing to educate them,

1:03:04.258 --> 1:03:05.520
nothing to teach them

1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:06.826
the horror of
their father's ways...

1:03:06.826 --> 1:03:10.177
I have heard enough!

1:03:10.177 --> 1:03:13.615
Do you women realize
we are talking about leaving?

1:03:13.615 --> 1:03:17.054
We are a large group.
Many things could go wrong.

1:03:17.054 --> 1:03:18.272
And time is fleeting.

1:03:18.272 --> 1:03:20.231
For the love
of our Lord Jesus Christ

1:03:20.231 --> 1:03:21.710
and precious Savior,

1:03:21.710 --> 1:03:24.235
shut your pie holes, please!

1:03:29.414 --> 1:03:32.156
How dare you
pass judgment on me?

1:03:32.156 --> 1:03:34.027
It wasn't a judgment.
It was a question.

1:03:44.516 --> 1:03:46.387
Tell her you're sorry.

1:03:50.304 --> 1:03:52.306
I'm sorry.

1:03:52.306 --> 1:03:53.655
I'm sorry that
what I said hurt you.

1:03:53.655 --> 1:03:54.961
Oh, fuck it off!

1:03:54.961 --> 1:03:56.223
Sit down, Mariche!

1:03:56.223 --> 1:03:57.616
It's "fuck off" I think.

1:03:57.616 --> 1:03:58.660
Shh!

1:04:00.227 --> 1:04:02.534
I am sorry.

1:04:02.534 --> 1:04:04.753
I'm saying sorry, not just
to leave the hurt behind,

1:04:04.753 --> 1:04:06.320
but because I feel truly

1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:08.670
that I should not have
said something harmful to you.

1:04:10.237 --> 1:04:11.717
And Mariche, I'm sorry

1:04:11.717 --> 1:04:15.068
because you do not
need or deserve any more harm.

1:04:17.418 --> 1:04:18.985
Who are you?

1:04:20.247 --> 1:04:22.075
Who are any of you

1:04:23.033 --> 1:04:25.992
to pretend
I have had a choice?

1:04:43.140 --> 1:04:47.057
I am also sorry, Mariche.

1:04:47.057 --> 1:04:51.931
I didn't try to protect you
or your children from Klaas.

1:04:51.931 --> 1:04:55.587
And what you say is true.
You had no choice.

1:04:55.587 --> 1:04:59.504
You forgave him,
again and again,

1:05:00.244 --> 1:05:01.898
as you were told to.

1:05:05.423 --> 1:05:07.120
As I told you to.

1:05:09.253 --> 1:05:10.515
I'm sorry.

1:05:12.299 --> 1:05:13.866
I'm sorry.

1:05:16.913 --> 1:05:18.436
I'm sorry.

1:05:38.847 --> 1:05:40.284
It's not only the men and boys

1:05:40.284 --> 1:05:42.503
who have been
excellent students.

1:05:54.689 --> 1:05:58.519
I think Mariche,
we are all very sorry.

1:05:58.519 --> 1:06:01.174
What you were required
to endure was a...

1:06:01.174 --> 1:06:04.003
Misuse of forgiveness.

1:06:04.003 --> 1:06:05.744
Is there such a thing?

1:06:05.744 --> 1:06:08.051
A forgiveness
that is not good?

1:06:08.051 --> 1:06:10.879
Perhaps forgiveness
can in some instances

1:06:10.879 --> 1:06:13.795
be confused with permission.

1:06:50.441 --> 1:06:51.920
What in heaven's name?

1:06:53.879 --> 1:06:55.620
What is it?
Julius, what is it?

1:06:59.189 --> 1:07:01.017
Nettie, please.
Make an exception

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:02.453
and tell us what is happening.

1:07:03.541 --> 1:07:05.064
What has happened to him?

1:07:06.631 --> 1:07:08.198
Nettie, be realistic.

1:07:08.198 --> 1:07:10.026
Tell us what has happened
to Julius.

1:07:10.026 --> 1:07:11.505
Speak. Just this once.

1:07:12.376 --> 1:07:13.986
What's wrong, sweetheart?

1:07:13.986 --> 1:07:16.945
My nose.
There's a cherry up my nose.

1:07:16.945 --> 1:07:18.730
Okay, well, blow.

1:07:18.730 --> 1:07:21.211
- Harder. Again.

1:07:24.823 --> 1:07:26.042
There you go.

1:07:26.042 --> 1:07:27.913
We have no cherries
in the colony.

1:07:30.089 --> 1:07:32.309
Klaas sometimes brings them
back from the city.

1:07:32.309 --> 1:07:34.572
Who gave you
the cherries, Julius?

1:07:34.572 --> 1:07:36.052
Papa.

1:07:38.706 --> 1:07:39.925
Why don't you...

1:07:39.925 --> 1:07:41.361
You go and play
with Nettie, all right?

1:07:48.803 --> 1:07:50.283
Have we
made a decision?

1:07:50.283 --> 1:07:51.719
Are we leaving?

1:07:53.721 --> 1:07:54.722
Yes.

1:07:55.810 --> 1:07:56.855
We are leaving because...

1:07:56.855 --> 1:07:58.117
We know why we are leaving.

1:07:58.117 --> 1:08:00.076
We are leaving
because we cannot stay.

1:08:03.992 --> 1:08:05.168
Hmm.

1:08:05.168 --> 1:08:06.691
We will take young boys of 12
with us.

1:08:06.691 --> 1:08:08.432
Allow the men
to join the women later

1:08:08.432 --> 1:08:10.216
under certain conditions.

1:08:10.869 --> 1:08:12.392
- No.
- No.

1:08:12.392 --> 1:08:14.090
Aaron. I know.

1:08:14.090 --> 1:08:16.222
Aaron is just over 12.
Just barely.

1:08:16.222 --> 1:08:18.529
Why would boys
of 13 and 14 be left behind?

1:08:18.529 --> 1:08:19.704
Why wouldn't
they leave with us?

1:08:19.704 --> 1:08:21.184
Surely, we don't
have to be afraid

1:08:21.184 --> 1:08:22.533
of the boys of this age.

1:08:22.533 --> 1:08:24.012
August, you're
the boys' teacher.

1:08:24.012 --> 1:08:25.927
What is your feeling
about this?

1:08:25.927 --> 1:08:27.146
Do boys of that age

1:08:27.146 --> 1:08:29.061
pose a risk
to our girls and women?

1:08:33.283 --> 1:08:35.328
Yes. Possibly.

1:08:35.328 --> 1:08:37.461
Boys of 13 or 14 are capable

1:08:37.461 --> 1:08:40.290
of causing great damage
to girls and women.

1:08:41.726 --> 1:08:43.510
And to each other.

1:08:45.382 --> 1:08:47.427
It is a brash age.

1:08:47.427 --> 1:08:50.865
They are possessed
of reckless urges,

1:08:50.865 --> 1:08:52.519
physical exuberance,

1:08:52.519 --> 1:08:56.784
intense curiosity
that often results in injury.

1:08:58.699 --> 1:09:00.962
Unbridled emotion,

1:09:00.962 --> 1:09:04.183
including deep tenderness
and empathy,

1:09:04.183 --> 1:09:05.532
and not quite enough

1:09:05.532 --> 1:09:07.795
experience
or brain development

1:09:07.795 --> 1:09:09.971
to fully understand
or appreciate

1:09:09.971 --> 1:09:12.844
the consequences
of their words or actions.

1:09:12.844 --> 1:09:14.367
They are like the yearlings.

1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:19.590
Young, awkward,
gleeful, powerful.

1:09:21.244 --> 1:09:22.767
They're tall, muscular,

1:09:22.767 --> 1:09:24.290
sexually inquisitive creatures,

1:09:24.290 --> 1:09:27.511
with little impulse control,
but they are children.

1:09:33.256 --> 1:09:35.388
They are children
and they can be taught.

1:09:37.825 --> 1:09:40.088
I'm a two-bit schoolteacher,

1:09:40.088 --> 1:09:41.916
a failed farmer,

1:09:41.916 --> 1:09:45.224
and above all a believer.

1:09:45.224 --> 1:09:48.140
And I believe
that with guidance,

1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:51.361
firm love and patience,

1:09:51.361 --> 1:09:53.450
these boys are capable
of relearning

1:09:53.450 --> 1:09:55.582
their roles as males
in the colony.

1:10:02.807 --> 1:10:05.592
I believe in
what the great poet

1:10:05.592 --> 1:10:07.203
Samuel Taylor Coleridge

1:10:07.203 --> 1:10:10.206
thought were the cardinal
rules of early education.

1:10:11.424 --> 1:10:12.947
"To work by love

1:10:14.732 --> 1:10:17.082
"and so generate love.

1:10:18.170 --> 1:10:19.606
"To habituate the mind

1:10:19.606 --> 1:10:21.826
"to intellectual
accuracy and truth.

1:10:22.827 --> 1:10:25.873
"To excite imaginative power."

1:10:29.703 --> 1:10:31.401
He said,

1:10:31.401 --> 1:10:35.927
"Little is taught
by contest or dispute,

1:10:35.927 --> 1:10:39.191
"everything by
sympathy and love."

1:10:48.896 --> 1:10:51.203
I believe the boys
should be allowed

1:10:51.203 --> 1:10:52.683
to leave with the women...

1:10:55.773 --> 1:10:58.428
Providing the women
choose to leave.

1:10:58.428 --> 1:11:00.125
It was a yes
or no question.

1:11:00.125 --> 1:11:03.346
You shit like any other man,
why don't you talk like one?

1:11:07.437 --> 1:11:08.438
Sorry.

1:11:11.179 --> 1:11:13.312
I have a proposal
to make.

1:11:13.312 --> 1:11:16.010
We have to protect
all of our children.

1:11:16.010 --> 1:11:17.751
Not only our daughters.

1:11:17.751 --> 1:11:20.276
Every boy under 15

1:11:20.276 --> 1:11:22.234
and the ones
who need special care

1:11:22.234 --> 1:11:24.497
must accompany the women.

1:11:24.497 --> 1:11:25.933
How do you mean must?

1:11:25.933 --> 1:11:27.195
What if they refuse?

1:11:27.195 --> 1:11:28.414
What if they
don't want to leave?

1:11:28.414 --> 1:11:31.504
We can't carry teenagers
on our backs.

1:11:31.504 --> 1:11:33.941
We will try
to influence our sons.

1:11:33.941 --> 1:11:35.378
But we cannot force them,

1:11:35.378 --> 1:11:37.380
and they might refuse,
it's true.

1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:38.598
August...

1:11:40.687 --> 1:11:44.300
you would stay and teach
the boys who remain?

1:11:45.388 --> 1:11:46.345
Of course.

1:12:02.666 --> 1:12:04.320
He's right outside.

1:12:06.626 --> 1:12:07.932
Klaas?

1:12:12.589 --> 1:12:14.199
He has Ruth and Cheryl.

1:12:16.767 --> 1:12:19.683
Everybody, back to your houses
and pack up.

1:12:19.683 --> 1:12:22.338
If anyone asks,
we were quilting.

1:12:22.338 --> 1:12:25.297
August, uh, get the map.

1:12:25.297 --> 1:12:26.516
Neitje and Autje,

1:12:26.516 --> 1:12:28.431
you must run right now
to every house

1:12:28.431 --> 1:12:29.997
and tell the women,
we are leaving.

1:12:29.997 --> 1:12:31.259
Tell them to pack up
everything they can

1:12:31.259 --> 1:12:32.391
and to meet us
outside the washhouse

1:12:32.391 --> 1:12:34.001
an hour after sunrise.

1:12:34.001 --> 1:12:35.438
We need to get
an early start in the morning.

1:12:35.438 --> 1:12:38.049
Let's all meet back here
at sunrise.

1:12:38.049 --> 1:12:39.093
All of us.

1:12:42.270 --> 1:12:43.620
An hour after sunrise.

1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:45.056
We congregate on the road
by the washhouse.

1:12:45.056 --> 1:12:47.275
- Do we bring...
- Everything. Bring everything.

1:12:47.841 --> 1:12:48.929
Why?

1:12:56.937 --> 1:12:58.722
- After sunrise... All right?
- Wake up.

1:12:58.722 --> 1:13:00.463
Tomorrow one hour
after sunrise.

1:13:00.463 --> 1:13:01.594
We're leaving after sunrise.

1:13:23.094 --> 1:13:25.313
We meet an hour after sunrise
on this road.

1:13:25.313 --> 1:13:26.489
Bring your buggies.

1:13:26.489 --> 1:13:27.925
Thank you, sister.

1:13:40.590 --> 1:13:42.374
Who can get home
the quickest, huh?

1:13:42.374 --> 1:13:44.463
She has a cricket
in her hands.

1:13:44.463 --> 1:13:45.595
You do?

1:13:47.292 --> 1:13:49.163
Can I see? Okay.

1:13:55.474 --> 1:13:56.736
Yes. Bed time.

1:13:57.258 --> 1:13:58.390
Yes.

1:13:58.390 --> 1:14:00.174
Don't go.

1:14:00.174 --> 1:14:04.178
Stay with me tonight.
Or I will go with you.

1:14:04.178 --> 1:14:06.616
If I don't go home, it'll draw
attention to all of us.

1:14:06.616 --> 1:14:09.183
- Mariche.
- Go home, Mother.

1:14:09.183 --> 1:14:11.055
I'll see you at sunrise.

1:14:50.094 --> 1:14:52.052
They said later,
it should have taken longer

1:14:52.052 --> 1:14:53.750
to pack up a whole life.

1:14:54.664 --> 1:14:56.361
It was disappointing

1:14:56.361 --> 1:14:58.668
to realize that everything
that ever mattered to you

1:14:58.668 --> 1:15:00.452
could be gathered up
in a few short hours.

1:15:04.587 --> 1:15:07.198
We would leave
only traces of ourselves.

1:15:22.605 --> 1:15:24.084
Go. Go.

1:15:32.484 --> 1:15:34.355
Psst. August!

1:15:36.662 --> 1:15:38.011
Come sit with me.

1:15:42.799 --> 1:15:43.887
Here's the map.

1:15:47.891 --> 1:15:49.153
Where are we?

1:15:51.808 --> 1:15:52.896
Here.

1:15:54.201 --> 1:15:55.246
Here?

1:15:55.246 --> 1:15:56.290
Mm-hmm.

1:15:57.596 --> 1:15:59.467
This is where we are.

1:16:06.431 --> 1:16:11.610
This is north, south,
east, and west.

1:16:12.263 --> 1:16:13.612
But the map moves.

1:16:13.612 --> 1:16:15.875
How do you know
which way it should be facing?

1:16:17.137 --> 1:16:19.487
Celestial navigation.

1:16:20.140 --> 1:16:21.794
I can show you.

1:16:27.626 --> 1:16:29.236
Do you know
of the Southern Cross?

1:16:29.236 --> 1:16:30.281
Mm-hmm.

1:16:31.151 --> 1:16:32.413
You and the women

1:16:32.413 --> 1:16:35.852
can use the Southern Cross
to navigate.

1:16:37.288 --> 1:16:39.420
If you, um,

1:16:39.420 --> 1:16:42.467
make your right hand
into a fist...

1:16:46.689 --> 1:16:51.563
Align the first knuckle
with the axis of the Cross.

1:16:53.043 --> 1:16:56.263
And then the tip
of your thumb here

1:16:56.263 --> 1:16:58.048
will indicate south.

1:17:08.798 --> 1:17:10.800
Will you show the others?

1:17:12.671 --> 1:17:15.413
We will have
a lesson in navigation.

1:17:17.545 --> 1:17:20.505
Did you already know
about this little trick?

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:24.640
Of course, I did.

1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:26.598
I wish there was something
I could teach you

1:17:26.598 --> 1:17:29.166
that you didn't already know.

1:17:49.926 --> 1:17:52.711
What will become of you
when we leave?

1:18:17.257 --> 1:18:20.826
You make a fist
with your right hand.

1:18:20.826 --> 1:18:24.743
And point your two knuckles
to the Southern Cross.

1:18:24.743 --> 1:18:27.441
It's called
celestial navigation.

1:18:33.970 --> 1:18:36.059
Point these two knuckles.

1:18:40.803 --> 1:18:41.891
Like that?

1:18:41.891 --> 1:18:42.935
Mm-hmm.

1:18:48.419 --> 1:18:50.900
And wherever your thumb
is pointing that's south.

1:19:08.439 --> 1:19:11.485
We like to put
frames around things.

1:19:11.485 --> 1:19:14.837
Even when they
are spilling out the edges.

1:19:14.837 --> 1:19:17.796
So, we gathered
one last time in the hayloft,

1:19:17.796 --> 1:19:19.450
where so much had been said.

1:19:21.147 --> 1:19:23.019
So much that your grandmother
would have told you,

1:19:23.019 --> 1:19:24.498
had you ever met.

1:19:46.956 --> 1:19:48.087
Is he gone?

1:19:49.872 --> 1:19:51.743
He's sleeping.

1:19:51.743 --> 1:19:53.266
Dead to the world.

1:19:55.399 --> 1:19:57.183
He was very drunk.

1:20:00.230 --> 1:20:01.405
And he caught me

1:20:01.405 --> 1:20:03.711
sneaking back
into the house late,

1:20:05.148 --> 1:20:06.497
and then he went to the barn

1:20:06.497 --> 1:20:09.674
and found we had
taken the horses.

1:20:09.674 --> 1:20:13.809
Mariche, did you
tell him what we are planning?

1:20:13.809 --> 1:20:15.723
She did. But only because
he wouldn't stop hitting me

1:20:15.723 --> 1:20:17.421
and she was trying
to distract him.

1:20:17.421 --> 1:20:19.640
I don't think
he believed me.

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:21.860
And even if he did,
I don't think he'll remember.

1:20:21.860 --> 1:20:24.080
He'll be passed out
all morning I'm sure.

1:20:27.692 --> 1:20:30.956
But I also told him because
I suddenly felt very...

1:20:46.406 --> 1:20:48.756
We have decided
that we want...

1:20:51.759 --> 1:20:52.935
That we are...

1:20:55.459 --> 1:20:58.592
We are entitled
to three things.

1:21:01.421 --> 1:21:02.596
What are they?

1:21:07.819 --> 1:21:10.300
We want our children
to be safe.

1:21:22.616 --> 1:21:23.835
We want...

1:21:23.835 --> 1:21:27.621
We want to be steadfast
in our faith.

1:21:31.147 --> 1:21:33.279
And we want to think.

1:21:36.804 --> 1:21:37.805
Yes.

1:21:41.635 --> 1:21:43.115
Praise God.

1:22:05.442 --> 1:22:07.313
Yeah. We all want that.

I saw your brother.

1:24:06.476 --> 1:24:07.912
Careful! We're gonna get you.

1:24:07.912 --> 1:24:10.045
Help me, I'm tied up.

1:24:12.177 --> 1:24:13.396
Where are they?

1:24:15.528 --> 1:24:16.747
Look there.

Just...

1:24:54.350 --> 1:24:55.873
August, you can speak
whenever you want.

1:24:55.873 --> 1:24:58.223
You don't have
to raise your hand.

1:25:01.008 --> 1:25:02.009
I...

1:25:05.839 --> 1:25:07.232
It's all right.

1:25:09.321 --> 1:25:10.801
It wasn't important.

1:25:17.590 --> 1:25:18.939
Oh.

1:25:22.117 --> 1:25:24.119
Are the children
clean and ready?

1:25:28.949 --> 1:25:30.864
Thank you, Melvin.

1:25:33.171 --> 1:25:35.260
Thank you for saying my name.

1:25:37.784 --> 1:25:40.004
We hid Ruth and Cheryl
for you.

1:25:40.004 --> 1:25:41.397
They are ready to go.

1:25:41.397 --> 1:25:42.920
Really?

1:25:43.573 --> 1:25:46.619
Well, oh, my girls.

1:25:48.969 --> 1:25:50.754
Has Aaron readied
the horses for us?

1:25:53.670 --> 1:25:54.975
What? Well, where is he?

1:25:56.977 --> 1:25:58.065
Where is he?

1:25:58.762 --> 1:26:00.285
- No.
- Speak to me.

1:26:00.285 --> 1:26:01.852
-  You're safe, Melvin.
- Please, speak to me.

1:26:01.852 --> 1:26:02.853
No, no, no. I won't harm you.
I'm not your enemy!

1:26:02.853 --> 1:26:03.897
You have to be calm, Salome.

1:26:03.897 --> 1:26:05.812
- No!
- Aaron will be found.

1:26:05.812 --> 1:26:07.510
I'm not leaving without him.

1:26:11.601 --> 1:26:13.907
Salome, come back!

1:26:17.824 --> 1:26:19.739
What if she
doesn't convince him?

1:26:23.439 --> 1:26:24.440
Mother?

1:26:27.530 --> 1:26:28.574
Breathe.

1:26:29.401 --> 1:26:30.489
Breathe.

1:26:36.756 --> 1:26:38.280
We are going to go now.

1:26:43.154 --> 1:26:45.287
I'm all right. Please go.

1:26:45.287 --> 1:26:47.767
Come on, let's go.

1:26:49.029 --> 1:26:50.030
Now?

1:26:50.553 --> 1:26:51.554
Yes.

1:26:52.424 --> 1:26:53.773
Make a list, August.

1:26:55.297 --> 1:26:56.776
A list of what?

1:26:56.776 --> 1:26:58.256
Of good things.

1:26:58.256 --> 1:27:00.519
Of plans, of memories.

1:27:00.519 --> 1:27:02.695
Whatever you feel
goes into a good list.

1:27:03.653 --> 1:27:05.742
What we, the women
will want there.

1:27:05.742 --> 1:27:06.786
Please write it down.

1:27:09.093 --> 1:27:10.268
August.

1:27:11.965 --> 1:27:14.620
Thank you for all you've done.

1:27:14.620 --> 1:27:17.275
We are all so proud of you.

1:27:22.976 --> 1:27:25.501
And your mother
would be proud too.

1:27:32.769 --> 1:27:34.292
I'll make a list.

1:27:37.208 --> 1:27:39.341
This is going
to be a difficult trip.

1:27:39.341 --> 1:27:42.213
Today is the day
the Lord hath made.

1:27:43.736 --> 1:27:44.998
Rejoice...

1:27:47.349 --> 1:27:48.741
and be glad in it.

1:27:53.268 --> 1:27:54.965
Go join the others.

1:27:55.879 --> 1:27:57.054
Please.

1:28:06.585 --> 1:28:09.458
I will not be buried
in this colony.

1:28:11.460 --> 1:28:15.202
Get me into a buggy now
and let me die on the trail.

1:28:16.508 --> 1:28:18.423
But what about August?

1:28:18.423 --> 1:28:19.511
Oh!

1:28:24.124 --> 1:28:25.430
He'll be fine.

1:28:32.045 --> 1:28:33.656
He'll be fine.

1:28:55.417 --> 1:28:56.722
Hang on with both hands.

1:29:08.778 --> 1:29:09.779
Ona!

1:29:15.915 --> 1:29:17.395
I will always love you.

1:29:40.157 --> 1:29:42.594
She loves you too, August.

1:29:42.594 --> 1:29:44.509
She loves everyone.

1:30:23.679 --> 1:30:25.289
Sun.

1:30:29.598 --> 1:30:31.251
Stars.

1:30:33.863 --> 1:30:35.473
Pails.

1:30:38.476 --> 1:30:40.130
The harvest.

1:30:43.742 --> 1:30:45.265
Numbers.

1:30:47.398 --> 1:30:48.660
Window.

1:30:51.141 --> 1:30:52.490
Straw.

1:30:55.014 --> 1:30:56.407
Sounds.

1:30:59.628 --> 1:31:01.194
Beams.

1:31:07.026 --> 1:31:08.463
Love.

1:31:11.683 --> 1:31:13.946
All right. We'll go.

1:31:21.388 --> 1:31:22.694
Language.

1:31:26.481 --> 1:31:27.873
Wind.

1:31:32.617 --> 1:31:34.010
Women.

1:31:43.672 --> 1:31:44.847
Salome?

1:31:49.068 --> 1:31:50.766
We may need
to protect ourselves.

1:31:52.724 --> 1:31:53.769
Where is Aaron?

1:31:55.205 --> 1:31:56.989
He's in the buggy, waiting.

1:31:58.077 --> 1:31:59.731
You convinced him to leave?

1:32:01.254 --> 1:32:02.473
You may need this.

1:32:03.909 --> 1:32:05.215
For protection.

1:32:06.912 --> 1:32:08.000
Did you?

1:32:10.437 --> 1:32:11.917
- Did you have...?
- Yes!

1:32:11.917 --> 1:32:14.093
He's coming with me.
He's my child.

1:32:26.497 --> 1:32:27.672
Goodbye, August.

1:32:29.674 --> 1:32:30.806
Good luck.

1:32:32.242 --> 1:32:35.114
Please take care
of Ona and her baby.

1:32:35.114 --> 1:32:37.029
Of course. I promise.

1:32:37.029 --> 1:32:38.857
Wait. I need
to give you something.

1:32:38.857 --> 1:32:40.380
No! I have to go!

1:32:46.909 --> 1:32:47.910
Here.

1:32:51.783 --> 1:32:53.350
Why have you
got a gun, August?

1:33:08.321 --> 1:33:10.193
Don't kill yourself, August.

1:33:11.542 --> 1:33:13.500
You have important work to do.

1:33:16.808 --> 1:33:19.985
You are the boys' teacher.

1:33:31.388 --> 1:33:32.607
Don't come back.

1:33:34.130 --> 1:33:36.132
Don't ever come back.
Any of you.

1:33:41.746 --> 1:33:43.095
Oh, wait. I need...

1:33:43.095 --> 1:33:44.357
No.

1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:48.492
Please.

1:33:48.492 --> 1:33:50.842
Please, Salome,
give these to Ona.

1:33:50.842 --> 1:33:52.452
But, no...
But she can't read them.

1:33:53.323 --> 1:33:55.020
Her child will read them.

1:33:56.587 --> 1:33:58.720
No, August.

1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:02.375
The purpose was for you
to take the minutes.

1:34:16.389 --> 1:34:17.739
We'll meet again.

1:34:18.740 --> 1:34:20.045
We'll meet again.

1:34:57.779 --> 1:34:59.476
Girls, now,
those can go in the back.

1:34:59.476 --> 1:35:00.607
That's fine.

1:35:02.261 --> 1:35:04.742
We have
more room back here.

1:35:04.742 --> 1:35:05.787
No, but thank you.

1:35:06.962 --> 1:35:08.659
Do you have
any more room?

1:35:08.659 --> 1:35:10.269
We have room
for one more.

1:35:11.967 --> 1:35:14.099
Or two little ones.

1:35:14.099 --> 1:35:15.710
She can sit
on my lap.

1:35:17.886 --> 1:35:19.365
It's sturdy now.

1:35:19.365 --> 1:35:21.193
Come with me.
Follow me.

1:35:23.587 --> 1:35:25.763
It's all right,
sisters. It's all right.

1:35:33.205 --> 1:35:35.381
Up, up.
There you go.

1:35:36.426 --> 1:35:38.036
Hold the baby
for now.

1:35:38.036 --> 1:35:39.690
You'll be riding
with your brother.

1:35:39.690 --> 1:35:40.691
I need a little
more rope to tie this down.

1:35:40.691 --> 1:35:41.692
I have some here.

1:35:49.004 --> 1:35:50.135
Are we all in?

1:36:03.322 --> 1:36:04.323
All right.

1:36:17.772 --> 1:36:19.512
So happy. Come on.

1:36:20.470 --> 1:36:21.688
Come on. Here.

1:37:37.895 --> 1:37:39.114
Shh, shh, shh.

1:37:45.033 --> 1:37:48.253
Your story will be
different from ours.
