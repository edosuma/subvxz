Possibly. There wasn't any fire or smoke

for losing that kid.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.514
What have we learned so far?

08:56.582 --> 08:58.183
Anada Benjawan,

08:58.251 --> 09:01.019
Thailand's minister of interior,

09:01.087 --> 09:03.688
is in New Orleans to meet
with Hydrowall Systems.

09:03.756 --> 09:05.457
It's a private contractor responsible

09:05.524 --> 09:07.759
for updating the city's
anti-flood technology.

09:07.827 --> 09:09.928
Her only child, Tanawat,
travels with her.

09:09.996 --> 09:12.097
<i>He was supposed to meet
with an admissions officer</i>

09:12.164 --> 09:13.498
in Tulane while they're here.

09:13.566 --> 09:15.200
Was there a ransom call?

09:17.036 --> 09:19.004
Not yet.

09:19.071 --> 09:21.273
Well, maybe whoever
took him isn't planning

09:21.340 --> 09:22.874
on giving him back.

09:22.942 --> 09:24.976
Minister Benjawan is

09:25.044 --> 09:27.812
a member of the recently-formed
Future Forward Party.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.180
Progressive party

09:29.248 --> 09:31.316
that is threatening to wrest control

09:31.384 --> 09:33.551
from Thailand's military regime.

09:33.619 --> 09:35.687
This Thailand First group
that threatened her...

09:35.755 --> 09:37.555
Big supporters of their
current government.

09:37.623 --> 09:39.557
Can't be happy Anada's
about to sign a deal

09:39.625 --> 09:42.027
- with an American contractor.
- They're not.

09:42.094 --> 09:43.161
And several of their known

09:43.229 --> 09:44.709
associates have obtained travel visas

09:44.764 --> 09:46.164
to the U.S. in the past.

09:46.232 --> 09:48.566
So it's possible one
of them kidnapped Tan.

09:48.634 --> 09:50.469
Sebastian knew the entire PSD protocol.

09:50.536 --> 09:52.304
There's no way he'd make
a mistake like this.

09:52.371 --> 09:53.805
We haven't been able to locate Tan

09:53.873 --> 09:55.373
in any of the security footage.

09:55.441 --> 09:56.908
Well, the alarm was pulled

09:56.976 --> 09:59.544
on purpose, as a distraction.

09:59.612 --> 10:01.479
<i>Could be whoever is responsible</i>

10:01.547 --> 10:03.181
<i>knew how to avoid the cameras.</i>

10:03.249 --> 10:06.851
Or... maybe they were right
in front of us the whole time.

10:06.919 --> 10:08.687
What do you mean?

10:08.754 --> 10:11.856
When I was 16, I was really into
this girl from my neighborhood.

10:11.924 --> 10:13.358
All I wanted to do was be with her,

10:13.426 --> 10:15.894
but I couldn't let my
mother know about it. So...

10:15.962 --> 10:17.829
one night, both families got together

10:17.897 --> 10:19.030
and went to a street fair

10:19.098 --> 10:20.598
in Bensonhurst.

10:20.666 --> 10:22.867
Changed my clothes in the bathroom,

10:22.935 --> 10:26.438
blended in with the
crowd and slipped away.

10:26.505 --> 10:28.940
Six hours before anyone found us.

10:29.008 --> 10:31.242
That is a terrible thing
to do to your mom.

10:31.310 --> 10:33.745
Yeah, well, girl's got to
do what a girl's got to do.

10:33.813 --> 10:34.846
So you're saying

10:34.914 --> 10:36.548
maybe this isn't a kidnapping.

10:36.615 --> 10:39.384
I'm saying 18 years is a long time

10:39.452 --> 10:41.319
to be controlled by your mother.

10:45.324 --> 10:46.691
Stop the tape.

10:47.493 --> 10:49.694
<i>There. Upper right.</i>

10:54.367 --> 10:55.433
That's him.

10:56.803 --> 10:57.869
He's with a girl.

10:57.937 --> 10:59.004
It's always a girl.

11:00.806 --> 11:02.807
Got a plate. I'm gonna call dispatch.

11:02.875 --> 11:05.177
50 bucks says they went to a hotel.

11:05.244 --> 11:07.812
SEBASTIAN: <i>I mean, don't get me
wrong. I'm glad that Tan's okay.</i>

11:07.880 --> 11:09.640
I just... I can't believe
he gave us the slip

11:09.708 --> 11:11.075
just to go hook up with some girl.

11:11.143 --> 11:12.884
I'm an understanding guy, you know?

11:12.952 --> 11:15.720
You seem... decidedly less so.

11:15.788 --> 11:18.056
I feel like he could've
given me the heads-up.

11:18.124 --> 11:19.791
I'm a-I'm a hip guy. You know?

11:19.859 --> 11:22.794
I've been around. I've hooked
up with s-several women.

11:22.862 --> 11:25.430
I'm gonna kill Tan for this.

11:25.498 --> 11:27.766
Okay, I'm gonna follow your lead.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.835
All right, kids. Party's over.

11:39.979 --> 11:41.212
What are we gonna do?

11:51.736 --> 11:55.036
<i>♪ ♪</i>

11:56.260 --> 11:58.960
<i>♪ ♪</i>

12:01.415 --> 12:02.448
SEBASTIAN: <i>Okay,</i>

12:02.515 --> 12:05.017
someone from Thailand First broke in,

12:05.085 --> 12:07.586
kidnapped Tan and then killed the girl?

12:08.588 --> 12:10.255
Well...

12:10.323 --> 12:11.690
according to the manager,

12:11.758 --> 12:13.625
this is a secure floor.

12:13.693 --> 12:17.363
The only people who
accessed it last night

12:17.430 --> 12:19.198
- were registered guests.
<i>- All right, well,</i>

12:19.265 --> 12:21.466
then we need to be talking
to every guest on the floor.

12:21.534 --> 12:23.054
Hannah and Gregorio are already on it.

12:23.103 --> 12:25.237
What is this?

12:25.805 --> 12:27.072
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.440
Don't-don't touch it. All right?

12:28.508 --> 12:30.275
You'll-you'll contaminate the evidence.

12:39.219 --> 12:41.487
Tan had a knife like this
last night at the club.

12:42.789 --> 12:44.790
Then I'm responsible
for this woman's death.

12:44.858 --> 12:45.991
How so?

12:46.059 --> 12:47.960
I gave Tan the knife
for his own protection.

12:48.027 --> 12:50.529
I should have known he was
too immature to handle it.

12:51.564 --> 12:53.565
You think he's capable of...

12:53.633 --> 12:54.733
murder?

12:54.801 --> 12:56.168
ANADA: <i>Special Agent Pride?</i>

12:58.338 --> 12:59.471
PRIDE: <i>Madam Minister,</i>

12:59.539 --> 13:00.939
you really can't be here right now.

13:01.007 --> 13:02.908
Kasem said you found my son.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.677
Oh, my God. Whose blood is that?

13:05.745 --> 13:07.079
It's not Tan's.

13:07.147 --> 13:08.480
Where is my son?

13:08.548 --> 13:09.748
KASEM: <i>Madam Minister,</i>

13:09.816 --> 13:11.483
I need to speak to you about Tan.

13:11.551 --> 13:12.818
Come this way.

13:16.556 --> 13:17.823
Pride.

13:17.891 --> 13:19.758
Come check this out.

13:19.826 --> 13:23.195
Look at the way that the blood
pooled around her body.

13:23.263 --> 13:24.930
<i>Stops in the middle of the bed.</i>

13:24.998 --> 13:27.266
Like Tan killed her and then...

13:27.333 --> 13:29.201
went to sleep

13:29.269 --> 13:31.603
and his body formed a barrier?

13:31.671 --> 13:34.439
How do you go to sleep

13:34.507 --> 13:36.008
after you...

13:36.075 --> 13:38.076
brutally murdered someone?

13:40.079 --> 13:42.314
I can't shake the feeling
that Tan wouldn't do this.

13:42.382 --> 13:44.483
You don't really know him, Sebastian.

13:44.551 --> 13:47.186
Regardless, we need to figure
out what happened here.

13:47.253 --> 13:48.487
I'll get the body to Wade.

13:48.555 --> 13:50.222
You need to keep an eye on the minister.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.624
Yeah, all right. I'll go back
to the residence with them,

13:52.692 --> 13:54.293
see if I can get into Tan's computer.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.961
Maybe there's an alternate theory there.

13:56.029 --> 13:57.696
We'll work on ID'ing this woman,

13:57.764 --> 14:00.098
see what connection she had to Tan.

14:04.137 --> 14:05.971
(SIGHS)

14:19.452 --> 14:20.619
Hi there. What can I get ya?

14:20.687 --> 14:22.654
- I'll have a cup of coffee, please.
- That's all?

14:22.722 --> 14:25.257
Actually, I was hoping
we could sit and talk.

14:28.595 --> 14:31.730
We-we have nothing to... talk about.

14:32.832 --> 14:34.366
Bonnie, cover my section for me.

14:34.434 --> 14:35.767
Wait, please.

14:37.003 --> 14:40.239
Uh, I just want to
make sure you're okay.

14:40.306 --> 14:42.574
How did you find me here?

14:42.642 --> 14:45.077
The emergency contact
on your intake form.

14:45.144 --> 14:47.713
You look worse than you did last night,

14:47.780 --> 14:49.248
even under all that makeup.

14:49.315 --> 14:51.817
Really? (SCOFFS) Do I?

14:51.885 --> 14:53.585
Might have something
to do with the police

14:53.653 --> 14:55.554
- showing up at my door.
- Believe me,

14:55.622 --> 14:57.956
I did not want to call them,
but I have no choice.

14:58.024 --> 14:59.791
I'm a mandatory reporter.

14:59.859 --> 15:02.027
But I would like to help you.

15:03.096 --> 15:04.997
You have helped enough.

15:06.299 --> 15:08.934
Coffee's on the house
if you take it to go.

15:12.939 --> 15:14.873
GREGORIO: <i>Got an ID on our victim.</i>

15:14.941 --> 15:17.609
Claire Roberts from San Francisco.

15:17.677 --> 15:19.444
<i>Clean record, but she
was a student teacher,</i>

15:19.512 --> 15:21.380
so her prints were in the system.

15:21.447 --> 15:22.848
What's the connection to Tan?

15:22.916 --> 15:25.050
They met six months ago when
he was on a college tour

15:25.118 --> 15:26.451
at UC Berkeley.

15:26.519 --> 15:28.287
Must've made quite an impression.

15:28.354 --> 15:30.923
E-mails on Tan's computer show
they kept in touch ever since,

15:30.990 --> 15:32.325
but nothing suggests a motive.

15:32.392 --> 15:34.159
Hey, I know Sebastian
thinks he's innocent,

15:34.227 --> 15:36.428
but this doesn't look good.

15:36.496 --> 15:40.332
The security footage from
the alley behind the hotel.

15:43.169 --> 15:45.437
He literally has blood on his hands.

15:45.505 --> 15:46.838
How did no one stop him?

15:46.906 --> 15:48.941
Question is is he running

15:49.008 --> 15:51.276
- because he just killed his girlfriend
- (PHONE DINGS)

15:51.344 --> 15:53.979
or because he's in danger, too?

15:54.047 --> 15:56.315
Loretta's done with her autopsy.

15:56.382 --> 15:58.483
You two keep digging.

15:58.551 --> 16:00.652
See if you can find out

16:00.720 --> 16:04.356
where Tan went after he left the hotel.

16:09.529 --> 16:10.862
Hey.

16:10.930 --> 16:12.297
I thought there were no prints

16:12.365 --> 16:13.799
or DNA found on the murder weapon.

16:13.866 --> 16:16.301
Mm, there weren't. I
found unidentified fibers.

16:16.369 --> 16:18.036
The techs are working with it now.

16:18.104 --> 16:20.672
They're just not as quick as Sebastian.

16:20.740 --> 16:23.675
Now, regarding Miss...

16:24.677 --> 16:26.111
Roberts.

16:26.179 --> 16:27.646
(CHUCKLES) Right.

16:27.714 --> 16:29.514
Well, unfortunately for Mr. Benjawan,

16:29.582 --> 16:33.151
his was the only foreign
DNA I found on her body.

16:33.219 --> 16:35.020
Signs of a struggle?

16:35.088 --> 16:36.188
WADE: <i>Not exactly.</i>

16:36.255 --> 16:38.190
<i>I found the couple had</i>

16:38.257 --> 16:40.525
intercourse shortly
before she was killed.

16:40.593 --> 16:44.196
Uh, Miss Roberts' tox screen
was clean except for alcohol.

16:44.263 --> 16:49.067
<i>But he had a curious combination of GHB</i>

16:49.135 --> 16:50.869
and Spice in his system.

16:50.937 --> 16:52.537
That explains him falling asleep.

16:52.605 --> 16:53.839
<i>GHB alone</i>

16:53.906 --> 16:55.407
could cause hallucinations,

16:55.475 --> 16:57.175
amnesia, loss of consciousness.

16:57.243 --> 17:00.379
And paired with a synthetic cannabinoid

17:00.446 --> 17:02.714
known for causing violent outbursts?

17:02.782 --> 17:04.249
He could have attacked her,

17:04.317 --> 17:06.752
then blacked out for hours

17:06.819 --> 17:10.155
without realizing what he'd done.

17:14.093 --> 17:15.861
(SIGHS SOFTLY)

17:15.928 --> 17:17.762
Something on your mind?

17:18.830 --> 17:22.000
My last patient last night at the clinic

17:22.068 --> 17:25.837
was a woman showing
clear signs of abuse.

17:25.905 --> 17:27.772
I offered to help,

17:27.839 --> 17:30.642
and she ran out.

17:33.646 --> 17:36.548
That must've been difficult,

17:36.616 --> 17:39.051
considering everything that
Reginald put you through.

17:39.118 --> 17:40.452
What did you do?

17:40.520 --> 17:42.454
Well, what I was bound by law to do.

17:42.522 --> 17:45.123
I reported the abuse to the NOPD.

17:45.191 --> 17:46.558
Did they look into it?

17:46.626 --> 17:47.726
Yes.

17:47.794 --> 17:49.795
But in cases like this,
getting the police involved

17:49.862 --> 17:52.697
can make it worse for the victim.

17:52.765 --> 17:55.600
I followed up with her
this morning at her work...

17:56.869 --> 17:59.604
...but ended up pushing
her further away.

18:02.308 --> 18:05.077
Never known you to give up on anyone.

18:05.144 --> 18:07.145
And I'm not gonna start now.

18:08.347 --> 18:11.183
I just have to find another way.

ANADA: <i>I have not heard
of this Claire Roberts.</i>

18:17.657 --> 18:19.458
But I can assure you,

18:19.525 --> 18:21.326
<i>my son is not capable of murder.</i>

18:21.394 --> 18:23.962
He has no reason to hurt this girl.

18:24.030 --> 18:27.499
Well, has-has Tan been affected
by the threats against you?

18:27.567 --> 18:30.335
<i>Or has he been withdrawn?
Or have you noticed him</i>

18:30.403 --> 18:31.903
acting strangely?

18:31.971 --> 18:34.473
No. He's the same respectful boy

18:34.540 --> 18:35.907
- he always been.
<i>- Well, you know,</i>

18:35.975 --> 18:37.352
given all the pressure
that-that you're under,

18:37.376 --> 18:38.577
it's completely understandable

18:38.644 --> 18:40.879
if you've missed any changes in Tan.

18:42.849 --> 18:45.718
Are you accusing me of
not knowing my own son?

18:45.785 --> 18:47.752
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm just saying

18:47.820 --> 18:50.088
that-that not all sons...

18:50.156 --> 18:51.923
share everything with their mothers.

Mine does.

with Hydrowall to happen.

19:16.983 --> 19:18.909
It will change thousands
of lives for the better.

19:18.934 --> 19:21.695
Yeah, well, you'll have to forgive
me if I'm a little bit more focused

19:21.721 --> 19:23.622

Roberts and finding Tan

Eh, I just had a face-off
with the permanent secretary.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.575
We've been digging into the de
facto leader of Thailand First.

19:43.643 --> 19:44.876
I had a contact

19:44.944 --> 19:47.245
in Southeast Asia that gave us
a number for their command.

19:47.313 --> 19:49.124
They received an incoming call
from someone in New Orleans

19:49.148 --> 19:50.548
- three days ago.
- Yeah, we tracked

19:50.616 --> 19:52.751
the phone, but it's not
pinging off any cell towers

19:52.818 --> 19:55.220
since late last night.
We think it's off.

19:55.288 --> 19:57.368
- And Patton's out of town.
- We're at Patton's desk.

19:57.392 --> 19:59.358
Can you tell us how to turn
the phone on remotely?

19:59.425 --> 20:01.225
Uh, no, I can't, because
that would be illegal

20:01.249 --> 20:02.529
and I'm not comfortable doing...

20:02.553 --> 20:04.999
Sebastian, it's a secure line.
The NSA's not listening.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.833
Oh, in that case, it's super easy.

20:08.901 --> 20:10.021
Yeah, just go to my computer

20:10.069 --> 20:12.103
<i>and, uh, open up a folder</i>

to put in the password,</i>

20:22.430 --> 20:24.264

20:34.994 --> 20:36.714
- and it should turn on.
- GREGORIO: <i>Got it.</i>

20:39.465 --> 20:41.099
Sebastian, you're a genius.

20:41.167 --> 20:42.727
Yeah, duh. It only took you three years

20:42.768 --> 20:44.035
to acknowledge that fact.

20:44.103 --> 20:45.103
Looks like...

20:45.171 --> 20:47.639
the phone was last in Uptown.

20:47.707 --> 20:50.041
I'm gonna call it and
see where it is now.

20:50.109 --> 20:52.110
(PHONE RINGING)

20:58.184 --> 20:59.784
Think I just found it.

21:02.388 --> 21:04.256
I just need you to, uh,

21:04.323 --> 21:05.701

21:23.920 --> 21:25.721
I can't believe I didn't see it coming.

21:25.788 --> 21:27.890
I should have known something
was up with that guy.

21:27.957 --> 21:29.758
Look, we all missed it, Sebastian.

21:29.826 --> 21:32.928
Now is not the time to doubt yourself.

21:32.996 --> 21:34.329
What do we know about Kasem?

21:34.397 --> 21:36.365
Ugh. He's got really sharp elbows.

21:36.432 --> 21:38.734
And he was in contact
with Thailand First,

21:38.801 --> 21:41.436
the group that's been threatening Anada.

21:41.504 --> 21:43.872
So, what, he went after Tan
just to make a statement?

21:43.940 --> 21:45.874
We still don't know
that Tan is innocent.

21:45.942 --> 21:47.542
Kasem could just be protecting him.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.879
Kasem is the guilty party, Agent Pride.

21:50.947 --> 21:53.015
You should be going after him.

21:53.082 --> 21:54.216
And we are.

21:54.284 --> 21:55.751
For attacking Agent Lund.

21:55.818 --> 21:58.220
There is no physical evidence

21:58.288 --> 22:00.422
linking Kasem to Miss Roberts' murder.

22:00.490 --> 22:01.857
Then find some.

22:01.925 --> 22:04.860
Tan had no reason to kill Claire.

22:04.928 --> 22:08.063
He love her since they
first met in California.

22:08.131 --> 22:10.365
We've kept Agent Lund's
performance from our government

22:10.393 --> 22:11.993
in the interest of maintaining relations

22:12.017 --> 22:13.302
between our two countries.

22:13.369 --> 22:15.537
- But we're losing patience.
- Okay. All right.

22:15.605 --> 22:16.772
Just hold on a minute.

22:16.839 --> 22:19.107
Agent Lund was just doing his job.

22:19.175 --> 22:21.610
His job was to keep Tan safe.

22:21.678 --> 22:23.278
And he failed.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.714
<i>Let's go, Anada.</i>

22:32.322 --> 22:33.956
You know, earlier, the minister said

22:34.023 --> 22:36.058
that she'd never heard
of Claire Roberts.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.527
How did she know that
they met in California?

22:40.063 --> 22:41.630
- She's hiding something.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

22:41.682 --> 22:43.042
Every time she's about to open up,

22:43.066 --> 22:44.299
one of her people stops her.

22:44.367 --> 22:45.968
So we need to get her alone.

22:47.971 --> 22:49.938
GREGORIO: <i>That was a long call.</i>

22:50.006 --> 22:51.940
- FBI?
<i>- State Department.</i>

22:51.968 --> 22:53.488
They're worried this is gonna escalate

22:53.512 --> 22:54.943
into an international incident.

22:55.011 --> 22:57.579
They said there's only so much
they can do to protect us.

22:57.647 --> 22:59.982
In other words, we need to
find Kasem and Tan yesterday.

23:00.049 --> 23:01.850
- Anything in Kasem's background?
- Yeah,

23:01.918 --> 23:03.352
he worked in private security

23:03.419 --> 23:05.153
for 15 years making good money.

23:05.221 --> 23:06.822
Then last year, he took a huge pay cut

23:06.889 --> 23:08.523
to join Anada's security team.

23:08.591 --> 23:11.326
So he infiltrated her team
on behalf of Thailand First?

23:11.394 --> 23:13.314
Possibly, but he hasn't
had any contact with them

23:13.338 --> 23:15.931
up until three days ago, when
he showed up in New Orleans.

23:15.999 --> 23:18.333
Well, maybe it's money motivated.

23:18.401 --> 23:20.161
- Let's dig into his financials.
- All right.

23:20.185 --> 23:22.337
- Loretta, hey.

23:22.405 --> 23:26.441
Uh, Pride is with Sebastian
at the minister's residence.

23:26.509 --> 23:29.177
That's all right. I just
wanted to let you know

23:29.245 --> 23:31.380
that we were finally able
to identify the fibers

23:31.447 --> 23:32.981
from the murder weapon.

23:33.049 --> 23:35.350
Lambskin leather.

23:36.252 --> 23:37.619
A glove?

23:37.687 --> 23:39.054
Explains why there was no prints

23:39.122 --> 23:40.856
or DNA on the murder weapon.

23:40.923 --> 23:42.190
Thank you.

23:42.258 --> 23:43.392
But you didn't need to drive

23:43.419 --> 23:44.939
all the way over here to tell us that.

23:44.963 --> 23:46.328
Well, I'll be honest,

23:46.396 --> 23:48.530
my visit has a dual purpose.

23:48.598 --> 23:50.565
Tammy, you used to be a lawyer, right?

23:50.633 --> 23:53.502
I went to law school
so I could join the FBI.

23:53.569 --> 23:55.170
I never sat for the bar.

23:55.238 --> 23:57.278
- Why, are you in some kind of trouble?
- No, but...

23:57.302 --> 24:00.471
I'm hoping someone else might be.

24:03.279 --> 24:06.048
Um, I don't want to interrupt.

24:06.115 --> 24:07.515
- No, no, no. No interruption.
<i>- No.</i>

24:07.582 --> 24:08.916
I, uh, I was just on my way out.

24:08.984 --> 24:10.085
Pride needs my help.

24:11.487 --> 24:12.821
What's going on, Doc?

24:12.889 --> 24:15.891
I need to have someone arrested,

24:15.958 --> 24:17.325
but I'm not sure I can prove

24:17.393 --> 24:20.328
that they've broken a law.

24:20.396 --> 24:21.663
You sure you're okay?

24:21.731 --> 24:23.091
'Cause I got a judge on speed dial

24:23.119 --> 24:24.639
who could get you a restraining order.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.435
Just asking for a friend. Honestly.

24:26.502 --> 24:28.403
All right.

24:28.471 --> 24:31.706
Well, if we dig deep enough
we can find something.

24:31.774 --> 24:34.076
- I was hoping you'd say that.
- All right.

24:40.650 --> 24:43.018

24:43.086 --> 24:44.564
Yeah. I... I think.

24:49.425 --> 24:50.625
I mean, it's probably nothing.

24:50.649 --> 24:52.727
I will decide if it is nothing.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.463
Oh, okay. Well, there's just

24:54.530 --> 24:57.065

keeps circling the block.

24:57.133 --> 24:58.467
And the driver?

24:58.534 --> 25:00.035
I didn't get a good look.

25:00.970 --> 25:02.704
- I know.

I'm afraid I do not understand.

Everything is fine.

I just wanted a moment
alone with you to talk.

How you know more about
your son's relationship

You're protecting him.

25:46.082 --> 25:48.850
I'm a parent, too.

25:50.319 --> 25:52.587
My daughter Laurel was in trouble,

25:52.655 --> 25:54.189
I'd be her first call,

25:54.257 --> 25:56.825
and I'd do anything I
could to keep her safe.

25:56.893 --> 25:58.960

I'll protect him, but you
have to give me that chance.

Okay. All right. Let's just...

27:33.257 --> 27:36.159
Let's-let's start at
the beginning, okay?

27:36.227 --> 27:38.027
How did you two meet?

27:38.095 --> 27:40.930
I was touring UC Berkeley.

27:40.998 --> 27:42.599
She was a student there.

27:42.666 --> 27:44.667
Okay. Who made the first move?

27:45.870 --> 27:49.606
I'm not... very confident around girls.

27:49.673 --> 27:51.307
I've never really dated.

27:51.375 --> 27:53.710
So Claire just approached
you out of the blue?

27:53.778 --> 27:55.712
I guess so.

27:55.780 --> 27:58.615
I mean, sh-she started
asking me about Thailand.

27:58.682 --> 28:00.316
We just hit it off.

28:00.384 --> 28:03.720
Did she ever ask you about
your mother or her politics?

28:03.788 --> 28:05.708
Look, Claire wasn't using
me to get to my mother,

28:05.732 --> 28:07.557
if that's what you're getting at.

28:07.625 --> 28:08.892
We never even talked about her.

28:08.959 --> 28:10.994
How'd you sneak out of the club?

28:11.061 --> 28:13.997
Kasem gave someone $100
to pull the fire alarm.

28:14.064 --> 28:15.665
He told me we could sneak out the back.

28:15.733 --> 28:17.066
Kasem was in on it?

28:17.134 --> 28:18.802
It was his idea in the first place.

28:18.869 --> 28:19.936
(SCOFFS)

28:21.105 --> 28:23.239
You set me up.

28:23.307 --> 28:25.208
My mother would never approve of Claire,

28:25.276 --> 28:27.744
so we had to find a
way to meet in secret.

28:27.812 --> 28:29.312
Why did Kasem agree to help?

28:29.380 --> 28:31.014
Because he understood how hard it was

28:31.081 --> 28:32.715
for us to be together.

28:32.783 --> 28:34.818
What do you mean, "he understood"?

28:34.885 --> 28:37.854
He had a secret relationship, too.

28:37.922 --> 28:40.156
We talked about it a lot.

28:41.725 --> 28:43.993
A relationship with who?

28:44.061 --> 28:47.030

- I-I can't.
- You can.

30:43.714 --> 30:45.214
- I'm not strong enough.
- It takes

30:45.282 --> 30:48.184

everything you've gone through.

You just need to believe in yourself.

31:15.379 --> 31:18.648

when I was in your situation,

31:18.716 --> 31:22.385

to thank them properly.

Anything to suggest

31:54.918 --> 31:56.638
who he might've been
in a relationship with?

31:56.662 --> 31:58.921
No. But we dumped his financials,

31:58.989 --> 32:00.223
found three separate payments

32:00.290 --> 32:02.058
from a shell company going back a year.

32:02.126 --> 32:04.460
Right when he joined
Anada's security team.

32:04.528 --> 32:06.780
Can we link the shell
company to Thailand First?

32:06.805 --> 32:10.133
Not unless they've suddenly opened
an office in the Netherlands.

32:12.336 --> 32:13.736
What am I looking at?

32:13.804 --> 32:15.138
Turns out the company

32:15.205 --> 32:16.873
here in New Orleans wasn't the only one

32:16.940 --> 32:18.975
bidding on Thailand's
new flood control system.

<i>This is a company called</i>

32:20.477 --> 32:21.911

32:21.979 --> 32:23.413
<i>Based in Amsterdam.</i>

32:23.480 --> 32:24.747
We found four proposals

32:24.815 --> 32:25.948
<i>from different countries,</i>

32:26.016 --> 32:27.984
<i>all as competitive as Hydrowall's.</i>

32:28.052 --> 32:30.553
Meaning someone has a vested interest

32:30.621 --> 32:33.556
in making sure the
Netherlands gets the deal.

32:33.624 --> 32:35.344
So they framed the
minister's son for murder

32:35.368 --> 32:37.260
- just to scandalize her?
- Well,

32:37.327 --> 32:39.095
maybe Hydrowall wouldn't work with her.

32:39.163 --> 32:41.898
And FCD Construction gets the bid.

32:41.965 --> 32:44.067
Who else stands to benefit

32:44.134 --> 32:46.836
if the Hydrowall deal falls through?

of Foreign Affairs,

33:01.552 --> 33:02.618

33:02.686 --> 33:03.986
The State Department is aware

33:04.054 --> 33:06.289
of what's happening right
now, as is your government.

33:06.356 --> 33:07.990
And what is happening, exactly?

33:08.058 --> 33:10.326
We're placing you under
arrest for criminal conspiracy

33:10.394 --> 33:12.328
- and accessory to murder.
- What?

is all Kasem's doing.

33:25.375 --> 33:26.676
I think you've forgotten.

33:26.744 --> 33:28.678
- I have diplomatic immunity.
- Your government

33:28.746 --> 33:29.946
has had that revoked.

been appointed minister.

So you had your boyfriend
do your dirty work?

33:57.023 --> 33:58.508
- Boyfriend?
- Kasem.

33:58.575 --> 34:01.177
He told Tan he was in
a secret relationship.

34:01.202 --> 34:04.514
It was a relationship
of convenience only.

34:04.581 --> 34:06.949
We were simply two people
with the same end goal.

34:07.985 --> 34:10.052
