WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.076
THE NEW NEIGHBOR...
 OH, MY GOD. KATHERINE.

00:05.076 --> 00:07.108
TURNED OUT TO BE
AN OLD FRIEND OF SUSAN'S...

00:07.108 --> 00:11.212
AND THAT PINE TREE
IN THE BACK YARD...
 IT'S MY PRIDE AND JOY.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.045
WHO HAD A PROBLEM
MAKING NEW FRIENDS.

00:14.045 --> 00:17.288
OH, IT ABSOLUTELY KILLS ME TO
HAVE TO ASK YOU TO CUT IT DOWN.

00:17.288 --> 00:19.490
HER DAUGHTER
COULDN'T RECALL THE PAST.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.292
I'M JULIE'S MOM.
 WHO'S JULIE AGAIN?

00:21.292 --> 00:23.794
YOUR BEST FRIEND
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.

00:23.794 --> 00:26.397
BUT HER HUSBAND HAD NEWS
FOR SUSAN.
 YOU'RE PREGNANT.

00:26.397 --> 00:30.101
LYNETTE REVEALED
HER CONDITION.
 I HAVE CANCER.

00:30.101 --> 00:33.134
GABY AND CARLOS
BEGAN A SECRET AFFAIR.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.166
CAN YOU GET AWAY TONIGHT?
 ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:35.166 --> 00:38.169
AND EDIE UNCOVERED A SECRET
OF ANOTHER SORT.

00:38.169 --> 00:39.640
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME

00:39.640 --> 00:41.312
ABOUT YOUR OFFSHORE
BANK ACCOUNT--

00:41.312 --> 00:43.414
THE ONE WITH $10 MILLION
IN IT?

00:45.276 --> 00:47.778
(Mary Alice) THE GREAT
CRIME WAVE HIT WISTERIA LANE

00:47.778 --> 00:50.121
ON A TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

00:50.121 --> 00:55.326
THAT'S WHEN RESIDENTS FOUND
THEIR BARBECUES UPENDED...

00:55.326 --> 00:59.230
THEIR CLEAN LAUNDRY TRAMPLED...

00:59.230 --> 01:03.564
AND THEIR SKATEBOARDS MISSING.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.566
NATURALLY,
EVERYONE BEGAN TO ASK

01:05.566 --> 01:10.070
WHO COULD BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR SUCH CARNAGE.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.573
THE ANSWER
LAY IN THE HOME OF A NEIGHBOR

01:12.573 --> 01:16.447
WHO, 20 MINUTES EARLIER,
HAD BEEN ENGAGING IN...

01:16.447 --> 01:20.251
AN ALTOGETHER
DIFFERENT TYPE OF CRIME.

01:20.251 --> 01:22.253
OH, I GOTTA GET BACK.

01:22.253 --> 01:24.555
I TOLD EDIE I WAS JUST
GOING FOR A JOG.

01:24.555 --> 01:27.258
DO I LOOK SWEATY ENOUGH
FOR A 5-MILE RUN?

01:27.258 --> 01:29.260
YEAH. UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S MY SWEAT.

01:29.260 --> 01:32.323
MMM. MMM.
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA DUMP HER?

01:32.323 --> 01:34.325
(sighs) IT'S COMPLICATED,
OKAY?

01:34.325 --> 01:38.199
BESIDES, I DON'T SEE YOU
IN ANY BIG HURRY

01:38.199 --> 01:39.700
TO DUMP VICTOR.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.202
GENERALLY SPEAKING,

01:41.202 --> 01:44.475
WOMEN DON'T LEAVE THEIR HUSBANDS
FOR GUYS WHO HAVE GIRLFRIENDS.

01:44.475 --> 01:47.107
JUST BOOT THE BITCH.
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.380
HEY, I AM NOT AFRAID OF--
 (car door shuts in distance)

01:49.380 --> 01:52.143
OH, MY GOD!

01:52.143 --> 01:53.884
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

01:53.884 --> 01:55.286
(lowered voice) EDIE!

01:58.189 --> 02:00.151
(knock on door)
 (gasps)

02:00.151 --> 02:02.293
(Edie) GABY, YOU IN THERE?
 (whispers) OKAY.

02:02.293 --> 02:04.295
(normal voice) ONE SECOND!

02:09.259 --> 02:12.303
EDIE! WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

02:12.303 --> 02:14.535
I'M LOOKING FOR CARLOS.
HE WENT FOR A RUN,

02:14.535 --> 02:17.137
BUT IT WAS HOURS AGO.
 SORRY. HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.410
REALLY? BECAUSE IDA GREENBERG
SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT

02:19.410 --> 02:21.412
SHE SAW HIM ON YOUR PORCH.

02:21.412 --> 02:24.144
UH, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE, BECAUSE
HE'S THERE! THERE HE IS!

02:24.144 --> 02:25.145
WHAT?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.318
CARLOS!
HE'S AT YOUR HOUSE.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.651
OH,
HE JUST LET HIMSELF IN.
 OH.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.783
THERE YOU GO. HE'S HOME.

02:32.783 --> 02:35.556
OKAY. WELL, THANKS.

02:38.289 --> 02:40.431
YOU TOLD HER
I WAS AT HOME.

02:40.431 --> 02:41.462
SO?

02:41.462 --> 02:43.464
SO I'M NOT AT HOME.
I'M HERE.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.166
WHAT THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

02:47.468 --> 02:50.571
EDIE! EDIE, WAIT!

02:50.571 --> 02:52.573
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
DON'T GO!

02:52.573 --> 02:54.275
DON'T GO!
 WHY?

02:54.275 --> 02:58.809
UH, YOU, UH,
HAVE A BIRTHDAY COMING UP,

02:58.809 --> 03:02.483
AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO GET YA.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.922
OR MAYBE A COFFEEPOT

03:11.922 --> 03:15.226
OR SCENTED HANGERS

03:15.226 --> 03:17.228
OR... A NICE CLOCK RADIO.

03:17.228 --> 03:19.230
GABY, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

03:19.230 --> 03:21.272
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SURPRISE ME?

03:21.272 --> 03:23.774
UH, WAIT, BUT DON'T GO!
 (tires screech)

03:23.774 --> 03:26.877
I-I NEED A LITTLE MORE GUIDANCE!

03:44.855 --> 03:46.297
(brakes squeal)

03:46.297 --> 03:49.260
(basketball bouncing)

03:49.260 --> 03:53.233
DAMN IT, BOYS! YOU SHOULD NOT BE
SCREWING AROUND IN THE STREETS!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.965
SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET HURT!
 (both yelling)

04:18.257 --> 04:21.992
CARLOS!

04:21.992 --> 04:26.367
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
SOMEONE BROKE INTO OUR HOUSE.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.899
OH, MY GOD.

04:28.899 --> 04:34.405
AND SO ENDED THE GREAT
CRIME WAVE ON WISTERIA LANE.

04:34.405 --> 04:38.309
NO ONE EVER FOUND OUT
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE...

04:38.309 --> 04:42.913
EW. HONEY, YOU'RE ALL SWEATY.
GO CLEAN UP.

04:42.913 --> 05:00.471
BECAUSE IT WAS AN INSIDE JOB.

05:00.471 --> 05:04.405
YOU WILL NEVER SEE
DESPAIR HERE...
 (dog barks)

05:04.405 --> 05:06.337
OR RAGE.

05:07.638 --> 05:11.582
YOU WILL NEVER SEE
THE TINIEST BIT OF REGRET.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.489
YOU SEE, THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE HERE HAVE LEARNED

05:18.489 --> 05:21.652
THERE IS ONE SURE WAY
OF HIDING THEIR SECRETS...
 HEY.

05:21.652 --> 05:23.954
FROM THEIR NEIGHBORS.

05:23.954 --> 05:29.430
THAT'S WHY, IN THE SUBURBS,
THERE IS NOTHING MORE DECEPTIVE

05:29.430 --> 05:31.432
THAN A SMILE.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.007
SO WHAT DID JULIE SAY,
EXACTLY?

05:37.007 --> 05:39.940
SHE SAID DYLAN'S
NOT THE SAME GIRL.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.942
NOT THE SAME GIRL
LIKE SHE'S CHANGED,

05:41.942 --> 05:45.616
OR NOT THE SAME GIRL BECAUSE
SHE'S BEEN REPLACED BY A ROBOT?
 I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD,

05:45.616 --> 05:47.878
BUT JULIE SAYS DYLAN
DOES NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING

05:47.878 --> 05:49.380
ABOUT LIVING HERE.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.382
WELL,
MAYBE SHE BLOCKED IT OUT.

05:51.382 --> 05:54.485
DID SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN
TO HER WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG?
 I'M NOT SURE.

05:54.485 --> 05:57.127
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD
ABOUT THE WAY THEY LEFT.

05:57.127 --> 05:58.358
SO...

05:58.358 --> 06:00.861
IF IT ISN'T THE EARLY MORNING
GOSSIP BRIGADE.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.064
WHO ARE WE DISHING TODAY?
 UH, SUSAN.

06:06.096 --> 06:08.969
SHE'S STANDING RIGHT THERE.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.404
OH, MY GOD. HAVE YOU BEEN THERE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

06:13.404 --> 06:15.075
(laughs nervously)

06:15.075 --> 06:18.779
ANYWAY, I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU GIRLS ABOUT LYNETTE.

06:18.779 --> 06:22.613
WHAT ABOUT HER?
 WELL, SINCE SHE'S BEEN
SO TIRED FROM CHEMO,

06:22.613 --> 06:25.716
I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE
IF WE DID SOMETHING FOR HER,

06:25.716 --> 06:27.418
LIKE BRING HER LUNCH?

06:27.418 --> 06:29.119
UH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
 YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

06:29.119 --> 06:31.822
UM, GABY, WHY DON'T YOU BRING
YOUR VEGETABLE LASAGNA?

06:31.822 --> 06:33.524
SUSAN, YOU DO BEVERAGES,

06:33.524 --> 06:36.427
AND, UH, KATHERINE, WHY DON'T
YOU BRING A SIMPLE GREEN SALAD?

06:36.427 --> 06:37.668
I'D RATHER BRING DESSERT.

06:37.668 --> 06:40.431
OH, NO NEED, DEAR.
I ALWAYS BRING DESSERT.

06:40.431 --> 06:42.973
OH, I'M THINKING
MY LEMON MERINGUE PIE.

06:42.973 --> 06:44.605
OH, YUM.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.808
YEAH, HERE'S THE THING.
THE MOVERS LOST MY SALAD BOWL.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.810
MY PIE PLATES,
ON THE OTHER HAND--

06:49.810 --> 06:51.512
WILL NOT BE NEEDED.

06:51.512 --> 06:55.486
AS I SAID,
I ALWAYS BRING DESSERT.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.191
I KNOW.

07:01.191 --> 07:04.595
I WILL LEND YOU
MY SALAD BOWL.

07:04.595 --> 07:07.998
YOU REALLY DON'T WANNA MISS
BREE'S PIE. IT'S PERFECT.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.933
WHO AM I TO ARGUE
WITH PERFECTION?

07:12.933 --> 07:16.807
SORRY. IT'S JUST, SOMETHING
HAS BEEN DRIVING ME CRAZY.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.872
NOW YOU'RE PERFECT.

07:30.721 --> 07:32.182
D-DOES IT HURT?

07:32.182 --> 07:35.626
IT'S A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE,
BUT I'M FINE.

07:35.626 --> 07:37.127
TAKE A CARD.

07:41.091 --> 07:43.133
HEY, I TOLD YOU
I'M COLLECTING QUEENS.

07:43.133 --> 07:44.535
PAY ATTENTION.

07:44.535 --> 07:47.037
YOU REMEMBER WE PLAYED THIS

07:47.037 --> 07:48.899
WHEN YOU WERE IN LABOR
WITH PARKER?

07:48.899 --> 07:51.572
42 HOURS WITHOUT MEDS.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.074
I'LL NEVER FORGET
WHAT A TROUPER YOU WERE.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.607
WELL, LET'S NOT COMPOSE
MY EULOGY JUST YET.

07:56.607 --> 07:57.908
I'M STILL TROUPIN'.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.781
TAKE A CARD.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.482
RIGHT.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.955
IT'S FUNNY.

08:04.955 --> 08:08.118
WE PLAYED CARDS ON OUR HONEYMOON
THE DAY THAT IT RAINED.

08:08.118 --> 08:10.621
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
WE--WE LIT A FIRE--

08:10.621 --> 08:12.222
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

08:14.024 --> 08:15.165
SORRY.

08:15.165 --> 08:17.998
HEY, I TOLD YOU
I'M COLLECTING QUEENS.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.901
SHOOT. THAT'S RIGHT.

08:20.901 --> 08:24.134
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOULETTINGME WIN?

08:24.134 --> 08:27.007
I JUST WANNA MAKE YOU
FEEL GOOD.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.710
BY TAKING ALL THE FUN
OUT OF THE KILL?

08:29.710 --> 08:33.243
HONEY, I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST...

08:33.243 --> 08:36.145
(voice breaking)
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

08:36.145 --> 08:37.818
OUT.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.850
WHAT?

08:39.850 --> 08:41.852
YOU ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE DISTRACTING ME,

08:41.852 --> 08:43.724
NOT DEPRESSING
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.826
YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT
OF CHEMO?

08:45.826 --> 08:47.758
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

08:50.561 --> 08:52.833
HONEY, I'M YOUR RIDE.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.235
JUST GO. I'LL CAB IT.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.909
THERE'S THAT TROUPER
THAT I ADMIRE SO MUCH.

08:58.909 --> 09:00.611
OUT!

09:12.122 --> 09:15.656
CARLOS! HI!

09:15.656 --> 09:17.658
HEY,
THERE'S MY BIRTHDAY GIRL.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.789
OH. MMM!

09:18.789 --> 09:21.031
(chuckles)
IT'S A NICE CAR.

09:21.031 --> 09:22.262
WE GOT COMPANY?

09:22.262 --> 09:23.964
NO.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.066
THEN WHOSE IS IT?
(chuckles)

09:26.066 --> 09:32.172
IT'S... YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT
TO ME. SURPRISE!

09:32.172 --> 09:36.146
A CAR. I WAS GONNA GET YOU
EARRINGS.

09:36.146 --> 09:37.908
SO? GET 'EM.

09:37.908 --> 09:41.181
AND I WILL DRIVE AROUND
WITH THE TOP DOWN

09:41.181 --> 09:43.353
SO EVERYONE CAN SEE THEM.

09:43.353 --> 09:45.355
EDIE, I CAN'T AFFORD THIS.

09:45.355 --> 09:46.857
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

09:46.857 --> 09:49.359
JUST MOVE SOME OF
YOUR OFFSHORE MONEY ONSHORE.

09:49.359 --> 09:51.361
I TOLD YOU,
THAT ACCOUNT WAS A SECRET,

09:51.361 --> 09:53.363
WHICH IT'S NOT GONNA BE
FOR LONG

09:53.363 --> 09:55.626
IF I START BUYING
$80,000 CARS.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.301
NOW I'M SENSING THAT
THIS LITTLE NEST EGG OF YOURS

10:01.301 --> 10:04.775
IS A TEENSY BIT ILLEGAL.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.376
WHERE'D IT COME FROM?

10:06.376 --> 10:09.339
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT,
AND THE I.R.S. DOESN'T, EITHER.

10:09.339 --> 10:11.341
YOU WANT ME TO GO TO JAIL?

10:11.341 --> 10:12.843
GOODNESS, CARLOS.

10:12.843 --> 10:17.688
I-I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOUR SITUATION WAS SO...

10:17.688 --> 10:20.290
PRECARIOUS.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.953
WELL... I GUESS

10:22.953 --> 10:26.156
I'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE THIS
BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.

10:26.156 --> 10:28.628
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING,
BABE.

10:30.901 --> 10:33.904
LOOK, IF... (sighs) IF YOU
DON'T WANT THE EARRINGS,

10:33.904 --> 10:36.667
JUST PICK SOMETHING ELSE OUT
INSTEAD.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.168
JUST NOT TOO EXTRAVAGANT.

10:38.168 --> 10:39.209
(engine starts)

10:39.209 --> 10:41.211
DON'T WORRY.
I HAVE A THOUGHT,

10:41.211 --> 10:43.714
AND IT'S RIGHT
IN YOUR PRICE RANGE.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.717
(engine revs)

10:59.429 --> 11:02.032
(doorbell rings)

11:07.267 --> 11:10.300
OH! HI. HI.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.302
HEY, KATHERINE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:12.302 --> 11:14.674
WHY IS THERE A MOVING VAN
IN YOUR DRIVEWAY?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.777
OH, I MEANT TO CALL YOU.
I, UH...

11:16.777 --> 11:19.780
IT'S JUST BEEN SO NUTS.
I GOT A NEW JOB... IN CHICAGO.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.851
(gasps)

11:20.851 --> 11:23.453
WHAT? YOU'RE JUST LEAVING,
LIKE THAT?

11:23.453 --> 11:25.455
I KNOW! IT'S CRAZY, HUH?

11:25.455 --> 11:27.958
I REALLY WISH I HAD TIME
TO TALK,

11:27.958 --> 11:29.960
BUT I GOTTA FINISH PACKING.
 OH, WHOA. NO, HANG ON.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.993
LET ME JUST RUN AND GET JULIE SO
SHE CAN SAY GOOD-BYE TO DYLAN.
 OH, WE'RE REALLY IN A RUSH.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.996
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TIME--
 (glass shatters)

11:35.996 --> 11:38.999
TH-THAT'S OKAY, GUYS!
KEEP PACKING! I'LL CLEAN IT UP!

11:38.999 --> 11:40.370
KATHERINE?

11:40.370 --> 11:41.872
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:41.872 --> 11:44.835
YOU SEEM A LITTLE JUMPY.

11:44.835 --> 11:48.338
I JUST HAD A-A LONG NIGHT,
AND I-I HAVE A LOT TO DO.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.844
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS YOU.

11:58.248 --> 11:59.920
KATHERINE, HI.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.422
OH, UH, I BROUGHT YOU
THAT SALAD BOWL.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.925
OH, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE SO THOUGHTFUL.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.828
NO PROBLEM. HEY, YOU KNOW,
I WAS MEANING TO ASK YOU,

12:07.828 --> 12:10.130
HOW DID THAT JOB
IN CHICAGO WORK OUT?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.062
JOB?

12:12.062 --> 12:15.105
YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT
YOU LEFT SO SUDDENLY FOR.

12:15.105 --> 12:17.107
OH, RIGHT. YES, OF COURSE.
UH, GOOD.

12:17.107 --> 12:20.140
UH, IT WORKED OUT WELL--
VERY CHALLENGING.
 OH.

12:20.140 --> 12:23.743
I'VE GOT SOMETHING IN THE STOVE.
I'VE GOTTA GO.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.016
OH.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.430
SUSAN.

12:40.430 --> 12:42.933
WHAT?
I'M EATING FOR TWO.

12:42.933 --> 12:45.535
WELL, DO BOTH OF YOU
WANNA BE FAT?

12:45.535 --> 12:47.968
OKAY, WHEN I'M IN LABOR
AND I AM PUSHING AND SCREAMING

12:47.968 --> 12:49.970
TO BRINGYOURCHILD
INTO THE WORLD,

12:49.970 --> 12:51.972
DO YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO REMEMBER

12:51.972 --> 12:53.974
THAT YOU DENIED ME SYRUP?

12:53.974 --> 12:56.947
CARRY ON.

12:56.947 --> 13:00.010
MOM, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.882
OH, MY GOD.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.955
IS IT ABOUT MATT'S PARTY?

13:04.955 --> 13:07.818
YEAH. IT TURNS OUT
IT DOESN'T START UNTIL 10:00,

13:07.818 --> 13:09.920
SO CAN I STAY OUT TILL 1:00?

13:09.920 --> 13:12.923
WELL, UH, WELL, THE JOHNSONS
LIVE RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.

13:12.923 --> 13:15.896
YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S FINE.
 THANKS.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.899
WHOA, WHOA. IS THIS
THE JOHNSONS OVER ON CRESTVIEW?
 YEAH.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.301
YEAH, I-I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GO TO THAT.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.205
WHY NOT?
 WELL, I'VE DONE A COUPLE JOBS
AT THAT HOUSE,

13:25.205 --> 13:27.407
AND THEY HAVE SOME
REALLY WILD PARTIES.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.110
I DON'T EVEN WANNA TELL YOU WHAT
I'VE SNAKED OUT OF THAT TOILET.
 THOSE WERE
HIS BROTHER'S PARTIES.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.541
MATT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

13:31.541 --> 13:33.543
ALL 17-YEAR-OLD GUYS
ARE LIKE THAT.

13:33.543 --> 13:37.087
THE ONLY REASON MY BUDDIES
AND I EVEN HAD PARTIES

13:37.087 --> 13:39.419
WAS TO GET GIRLS WASTED.
 WELL, I DON'T DRINK.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.921
NEITHER DID MISSY TAYLOR,

13:40.921 --> 13:44.925
AND FAST-FORWARD TO HER TYING
HER BRA ON MY CAR ANTENNA.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.596
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,

13:46.596 --> 13:49.099
BUT MY MOM ALREADY TOLD ME
I COULD GO.

13:49.099 --> 13:50.600
(clicks teeth)
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

13:50.600 --> 13:55.505
JUST GIVING MY OPINION.
IT'S UP TO YOUR MOM.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.471
UH, WELL...

14:01.471 --> 14:03.974
I MEAN, YOU BOTH MAKE
A-A GOOD CASE.

14:05.946 --> 14:11.181
UM... BUT I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE TO AGREE WITH, UH...

14:11.181 --> 14:14.054
AND YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU BOTH--
 DECIDE.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.026
MIKE. I'M GOING WITH MIKE.
 WHAT?

14:16.026 --> 14:19.289
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS PARTY
COULD BE ON THE WILD SIDE,

14:19.289 --> 14:21.932
AND IT IS STARTING VERY LATE.
 THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

14:21.932 --> 14:23.433
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

14:23.433 --> 14:26.136
YOU WANTED A DECISION.
THIS IS MY DECISION.

14:27.537 --> 14:29.199
(scoffs)

14:33.273 --> 14:34.945
MORESYRUP?

14:34.945 --> 14:37.277
MISSY TAYLOR?

14:39.049 --> 14:40.450
CARRY ON.

14:45.355 --> 14:48.959
LOOK AT YOUR LITTLE DYLAN,
ALL GROWN UP.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.220
KAREN McCLUSKEY.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.222
I BABYSAT YOU
WAY BACK WHEN.

14:52.222 --> 14:54.224
YOU WERE A BITER.

14:54.224 --> 14:56.426
WELL,
I HOPE I DIDN'T HURT YOU.

14:56.426 --> 14:58.428
NAH, YOU WERE A CUTIE...
BUT LOUD.

14:58.428 --> 15:01.431
I REMEMBER THE RACKET YOU USED
TO MAKE ON YOUR TRICYCLE.

15:01.431 --> 15:04.434
I GAVE YOUR DAD HELL
FOUR PUTTING THAT HORN ON IT.

15:04.434 --> 15:06.006
MY DAD?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.007
MM-HMM.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.009
HOW COULD
YOU KNOW MY DAD?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.681
HE LEFT
WHEN I WAS A BABY.

15:11.681 --> 15:14.144
NAH, HE USED TO COME AROUND
ONCE IN A WHILE.

15:14.144 --> 15:16.146
ANYWAY,
NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK.

15:17.948 --> 15:20.150
(front door shuts)

15:20.150 --> 15:21.651
PLEASE LET ME HELP.

15:21.651 --> 15:24.024
I FEEL SO GUILTY
JUST SITTING HERE.

15:24.024 --> 15:28.058
DO NOT MOVE. WE WANT TO
PAMPER YOU, SO PLEASE LET US.
 THANK YOU.

15:28.058 --> 15:30.230
HEY, SO HOW'S
THE CHEMOTHERAPY GOING?

15:30.230 --> 15:34.004
OH, NO, NO. SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
 I DON'T MIND.

15:34.004 --> 15:37.968
OH, COME ON. LET'S DIG IN
TO THE PIE. LOOKS AMAZING.

15:37.968 --> 15:41.411
WOW.

15:41.411 --> 15:44.574
OH, MY GOD. BREE, THAT IS, LIKE,
THE BEST PIE YOU'VE EVER MADE.

15:44.574 --> 15:48.418
WELL, THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK
I DID ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.156
THIS IS NOT MY PIE.

16:02.993 --> 16:06.636
(laughs) OKAY,
YOU CAUGHT ME. IT'S MINE.

16:06.636 --> 16:10.100
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PIE
THAT I BROUGHT?
 OH, I WAS A LITTLE SNEAKY,

16:10.100 --> 16:13.573
AND I PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO TRY MINE.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.006
WELL, DID WE
OR DID WE NOT AGREE

16:16.006 --> 16:18.008
THATIWOULD BRING
THE DESSERT?

16:18.008 --> 16:21.011
I KNOW, BUT EVERYONE SAYS
YOU'RE SUCH AN AMAZING BAKER,

16:21.011 --> 16:24.014
AND I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD GIVE ME SOME TIPS

16:24.014 --> 16:25.985
TO IMPROVE MY RECIPE.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.987
WELL, CLEARLY NO TIPS
ARE NEEDED.

16:27.987 --> 16:32.122
AS MY FRIENDS SAID,
"BEST PIE EVER MADE."

16:34.164 --> 16:37.267
WELL, THEN PERHAPS YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

16:37.267 --> 16:40.470
I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY FOR
EVERYONE TO THINK IT WAS YOURS.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.674
SO BACK TO CHEMO--

16:44.674 --> 16:46.176
HOW'S THAT BEEN?

16:46.176 --> 16:49.539
YEAH, SO FAR...

16:49.539 --> 16:51.281
NOT THAT BAD.

16:51.281 --> 16:55.285
THOUGH I DID HAVE TO
KICK TOM OUT YESTERDAY.

16:55.285 --> 16:57.447
WHY?

16:57.447 --> 16:59.449
HE WAS GETTING SO EMOTIONAL.

16:59.449 --> 17:03.022
IT FELT LIKE THE LAST 20 MINUTES
OF "BRIAN'S SONG."

17:03.022 --> 17:05.125
(laughter)

17:05.125 --> 17:09.299
SO... I GUESS I'M IN THE MARKET
FOR A NEW CHEMO BUDDY.

17:09.299 --> 17:13.133
WELL, I WOULD BE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO GO WITH YOU.

17:14.804 --> 17:17.207
COUNT ME IN.

17:17.207 --> 17:18.538
I'LL SIT WITH YOU.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.540
I VOLUNTEER AT THE HOSPITAL,
SO I'LL BE THERE ANYWAY.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.041
OH! MY GOD, YOU GUYS.

17:23.041 --> 17:27.077
I'M SO TOUCHED YOU'RE ALL
WILLING TO DO THIS.

17:27.077 --> 17:29.079
WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.484
GABY?

17:34.484 --> 17:38.488
OH, NO CREAM FOR ME, THANKS.
(chuckles nervously)

17:49.099 --> 17:51.101
SHE UPSTAGED
YOUR LEMON MERINGUE PIE?

17:51.101 --> 17:53.503
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

17:53.503 --> 17:55.505
I'M NOT.
THAT DESPICABLE WOMAN

17:55.505 --> 17:58.208
WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO BRING
A SIMPLE GREEN SALAD.

17:58.208 --> 18:00.210
SHE NOT ONLY BROUGHT
A PIE--

18:00.210 --> 18:02.081
SHE HID MINE
AND SERVED HERS.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.754
WELL, THAT'S BEYOND DESPICABLE.
THAT'S CULINARY TERRORISM.

18:04.754 --> 18:09.189
OH, IT GETS WORSE.
HER PIE WAS BETTER THAN MINE.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.090
(mixer whirring)
 IMPOSSIBLE.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.424
IT'S TRUE.
EVERYONE THOUGHT SO.

18:14.424 --> 18:15.595
(whirring stops)

18:15.595 --> 18:18.528
EVEN ME. OH, AND THAT
SIMPLE GREEN SALAD--

18:18.528 --> 18:21.871
MACHE AND BABY ARUGULA WITH
DUCK CONFIT AND CANDIED WALNUTS!

18:21.871 --> 18:23.873
MY GOD, SHE PLAYS TO WIN.

18:23.873 --> 18:26.876
I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS
TRYING TO REPLICATE HER RECIPE,

18:26.876 --> 18:29.539
AND NOTHING HAS
EVEN COME CLOSE!

18:29.539 --> 18:32.742
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
THIS ONE'S FANTASTIC.

18:32.742 --> 18:36.246
THAT'S HERS!

18:36.246 --> 18:37.387
SORRY.

18:37.387 --> 18:40.390
ORSON, WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

18:40.390 --> 18:42.392
YOU MIGHT HAVE
TO BITE THE BULLET

18:42.392 --> 18:44.754
AND ASK HER FOR HER RECIPE.

18:44.754 --> 18:46.726
WHAT? SURRENDER?
DEBASE MYSELF?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.728
BREE,
IT'S YOUR SIGNATURE PIE.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.231
YOU MAKE IT FOR PARTIES,
CHURCH SUPPERS, BAKE SALES.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.204
IF SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT THERE
BEHIND YOU

18:54.204 --> 18:57.307
WITH HER SUPERIOR VERSION,
STAKING OUT HER CLAIM

18:57.307 --> 18:59.309
AS FAIRVIEW'S NUMBER ONE
HOMEMAKER...

18:59.309 --> 19:02.141
SHE WILL HAVE STOLEN
MY ENTIRE IDENTITY.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.773
WELL,
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

19:03.773 --> 19:05.275
NO, IT'S TRUE.

19:05.275 --> 19:08.618
THE ONLY THING ABOUT ME
THAT'S SPECIAL

19:08.618 --> 19:11.281
IS WHAT I CAN DO
IN THE KITCHEN.

19:12.782 --> 19:15.685
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:15.685 --> 19:18.388
I HAVE GOT
TO GET THAT RECIPE...

19:18.388 --> 19:23.893
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

19:23.893 --> 19:25.765
HEY, GABY.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.867
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

19:27.867 --> 19:30.240
WELL...
I FELT A LITTLE WEIRD

19:30.240 --> 19:32.242
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED AT LUNCH,

19:32.242 --> 19:34.744
AND I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT.

19:34.744 --> 19:37.247
I KNOW. DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT PIE BUSINESS?

19:37.247 --> 19:39.309
I THOUGHT BREE'S HEAD
WAS GONNA EXPLODE.

19:39.309 --> 19:42.312
(chuckles) NO, NOT THAT.

19:43.553 --> 19:45.715
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO SAY THIS,

19:45.715 --> 19:47.717
SO I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

19:47.717 --> 19:50.720
WHEN EVERYONE WAS OFFERING
TO COME WITH ME TO CHEMO--

19:50.720 --> 19:54.193
EVEN KATHERINE,
WHO I DON'T EVEN KNOW,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.666
YOU SORT OF CLAMMED UP.
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

19:56.666 --> 20:00.230
WELL, IT JUST SEEMED LIKE PEOPLE
HAD IT PRETTY WELL COVERED.

20:00.230 --> 20:02.702
YEAH, BUT BETWEEN US,

20:02.702 --> 20:04.704
YOU'RE THE ONE
I REALLY WANT THERE.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.706
OUT OF EVERYONE,
YOU'RE THE MOST FUN,

20:06.706 --> 20:08.708
AND I NEED THAT NOW.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.680
OH, THAT'S SWEET.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.383
BUT TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T LIKE HOSPITALS.

20:13.383 --> 20:14.684
NOBODY LIKES HOSPITALS.

20:14.684 --> 20:17.387
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S THE PLACE
YOU HAVE TO GO

20:17.387 --> 20:19.889
WHEN YOU'RE SICK,
OR YOUR FRIENDS ARE.

20:21.491 --> 20:23.493
YOUAREMY FRIEND, RIGHT?

20:25.325 --> 20:27.857
WHAT, IS THIS A TEST
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP?

20:27.857 --> 20:30.260
YEAH... KINDA.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.233
CAN I PENCIL YOU IN?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.369
I CAN'T WAIT.

20:44.314 --> 20:47.016
(lowered voice) PSST! COME HERE.

20:52.422 --> 20:54.754
OKAY, I'LL COME THERE.

20:55.885 --> 20:58.388
ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME
ABOUT THE PARTY?

20:58.388 --> 21:00.530
OH, YOU PICKED UP ON THAT,
DID YOU?

21:00.530 --> 21:03.032
OKAY, LOOK, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THINGS, AND...

21:03.032 --> 21:05.795
(whispers) JUST FORGET
WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

21:05.795 --> 21:08.368
(loudly)
YOU MEAN I CAN GO?

21:08.368 --> 21:10.670
SHH! JEEZ! OOH,
MIKE'S IN THE OTHER ROOM.
 YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL HIM?

21:10.670 --> 21:13.373
NO, AND NEITHER ARE YOU.
 (scoffs) WHY ARE YOU
WALKING ON EGGSHELLS?

21:13.373 --> 21:16.676
YOU ARE MY MOTHER. YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO OVERRIDE HIM.
 I KNOW.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.679
I JUST--I THINK IT'S SWEET
THAT HE WORRIES ABOUT YOU,

21:19.679 --> 21:21.681
AND I WANT HIM TO FEEL
LIKE HE'S PART

21:21.681 --> 21:23.683
OF THE DECISION MAKING
PROCESS.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.456
WELL, CLEARLY HE'S NOT IF
YOU'RE GOING BEHIND HIS BACK.

21:26.456 --> 21:28.588
DO YOU WANNA GO OR NOT?

21:28.588 --> 21:31.290
YES! YES, I REALLY WANNA
GO TO THE PARTY.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.663
PARTY? YOU GUYS STILL
TALKING ABOUT THAT?

21:33.663 --> 21:37.296
(sighs) CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

21:37.296 --> 21:40.299
UGH! LET IT GO.
YOU KNOW, MIKE AND I DECIDED--

21:40.299 --> 21:42.502
NO PARTY, AND THAT'S FINAL.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.873
(mouths words)

21:43.873 --> 21:47.477
(front door opens and shuts)

21:49.439 --> 21:51.010
(exhales deeply)

21:56.346 --> 21:57.347
BREE.

21:57.347 --> 21:59.349
I HOPE THIS ISN'T
A BAD TIME.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.851
I JUST WANTED TO BRING YOU
A HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

22:01.851 --> 22:04.354
IT'S THE RECIPE FOR
MY SPECIAL MINCEMEAT PIE.

22:04.354 --> 22:07.497
IT WOULDN'T BE THANKSGIVING
AT MY HOUSE WITHOUT IT.

22:07.497 --> 22:11.461
WELL...
AREN'T YOU THOUGHTFUL?

22:11.461 --> 22:13.763
LET ME JUST FILE THIS
IN MY RECIPE BOX.

22:13.763 --> 22:16.506
WELL, AS LONG AS WE'RE
SWAPPING PIE RECIPES,

22:16.506 --> 22:20.370
I WOULD LOVE THE ONE FOR
YOUR FABULOUS LEMON MERINGUE.

22:20.370 --> 22:23.543
REALLY? I'M SO FLATTERED
YOU'D ASK.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.715
BUT I DON'T SHARE THAT.

22:27.717 --> 22:29.849
EXCUSE ME?

22:29.849 --> 22:32.482
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND--

22:32.482 --> 22:33.983
I EXPERIMENTED FORYEARS

22:33.983 --> 22:37.727
BEFORE I CAME UP
WITH MY SECRET INGREDIENT.

22:37.727 --> 22:41.491
WHICH IS WHAT?
VANILLA? NUTMEG? CARDAMOM?

22:41.491 --> 22:44.464
IF I TOLD YOU, IT WOULDN'T
BE A SECRET ANYMORE.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.466
IT WOULD JUST BE
AN INGREDIENT.

22:49.038 --> 22:51.601
WELL, THAT, UM,
HARDLY SEEMS NEIGHBORLY.

22:51.601 --> 22:54.874
AFTER ALL, I JUST GAVE YOU
THE RECIPE FOR MY MINCEMEAT PIE.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.047
YES, AND IT'S A VERY GOOD ONE.
I HAVE THE BOOK IT CAME FROM.

22:58.047 --> 23:00.049
THAT RECIPE IS NOT
FROM A BOOK.

23:00.049 --> 23:03.883
THAT RECIPE WAS HANDED DOWN
TO ME FROM MY MOTHER.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.385
WELL, UNLESS YOUR MOTHER
WAS BETTY CROCKER,

23:06.385 --> 23:08.788
SHE GOT IT FROM A BOOK.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.561
OH, DEAR.
NOW I'VE UPSET YOU.

23:11.561 --> 23:14.123
NO. NO, I AM NOT UPSET.

23:14.123 --> 23:17.126

I GET IT.
YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.

33:57.166 --> 34:01.039
JUST GO. I'M FINE.

34:02.611 --> 34:05.314
I'M FINE.

34:05.314 --> 34:06.715
(inhales deeply)

34:14.623 --> 34:17.626
DID I EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT MY FATHER?

34:17.626 --> 34:20.188
HE HAD CANCER, TOO.

34:22.091 --> 34:25.634
STARTED IN THE LIVER,
WENT INTO HIS BONES,

34:25.634 --> 34:28.197
AND TEN MONTHS LATER,
HE WAS DEAD.

34:28.197 --> 34:30.438
THANKS FOR
THAT ENCOURAGING STORY.

34:30.438 --> 34:32.170
I'M NOT FINISHED.

34:35.103 --> 34:36.605
THOSE LAST WEEKS,

34:36.605 --> 34:40.579
EVERY DAY WE THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA LOSE HIM.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.112
AND EVERY DAY, BEFORE I
WOULD GO INTO HIS ROOM,

34:43.112 --> 34:46.614
MY MOM WOULD SAY,
"NO TEARS.

34:46.614 --> 34:48.617
"DADDY WANTS TO SEE YOU
SMILING.

34:48.617 --> 34:51.120
IF YOU'RE GONNA CRY,
YOU CAN'T GO IN."

34:52.621 --> 34:57.126
SO... ON THE LAST NIGHT...

34:57.126 --> 34:59.698
I SAT THERE
AND I WATCHED HIM DIE.

35:02.671 --> 35:04.173
HIS EYES WERE CLOSED,

35:04.173 --> 35:06.835
BUT I THOUGHT
HE COULD STILL SEE ME.

35:06.835 --> 35:10.108
SO I KEPT SMILING...

35:13.142 --> 35:14.683
ALL NIGHT.

35:18.147 --> 35:19.788
I WAS 5.

35:19.788 --> 35:23.192
OH, MY GOD.

35:23.192 --> 35:25.194
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE,

35:25.194 --> 35:28.457
I MADE A PRETTY GOOD CAREER
OUT OF KNOWING HOW TO SMILE

35:28.457 --> 35:31.200
WHEN I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL
LIKE IT. (sniffles)

35:36.735 --> 35:40.309
BUT I CAN'T PRETEND
WITH YOU.

35:43.212 --> 35:45.914
NOT WHEN I'M SCARED
I'M GONNA LOSE YOU.

35:45.914 --> 35:49.318
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE ME.

35:49.318 --> 35:51.380
(crying)

35:51.380 --> 35:53.752
YOU PROMISE?

35:53.752 --> 35:56.485
'CAUSE IF I DID...

35:56.485 --> 35:59.888
THEN...

35:59.888 --> 36:03.161
(laughs)
GOD! I'M SUCH A MESS.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.235
IT'S OKAY. COME HERE.
LET IT GO. OH.

36:06.235 --> 36:08.197
(sniffles)

36:49.708 --> 36:51.510
(Katherine) HONEY?

36:51.510 --> 36:54.843
I'M GOING TO GET ADAM.
BE RIGHT BACK.

36:54.843 --> 36:57.386
MOM?

36:58.417 --> 37:00.749
CAN I TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?

37:00.749 --> 37:03.552
SURE. IF YOU DON'T MIND
TALKING IN THE CAR.

37:06.325 --> 37:09.358
BREE HODGE PERSISTED
IN HER EFFORT

37:09.358 --> 37:11.229
TO UNLOCK THE SECRET

37:11.229 --> 37:14.533
OF KATHERINE MAYFAIR'S
LEMON MERINGUE.

37:14.533 --> 37:18.767
BUT AFTER
SEVERAL FAILED ATTEMPTS,

37:18.767 --> 37:21.770
IT OCCURRED TO BREE
THAT WHILE SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE

37:21.770 --> 37:24.773
THE KEY
TO KATHERINE'S RECIPE...

37:26.315 --> 37:28.947
SHE DID HAVE THE KEY...

37:28.947 --> 37:31.320
TO KATHERINE'S HOUSE.

38:00.048 --> 38:02.511
(sighs)

38:06.815 --> 38:09.888
OH, HEY, WHAT'S UP?
 I WAS DOING A LITTLE BAKING,

38:09.888 --> 38:12.391
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD BORROW SOMETHING.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.393
SURE. WHAT DO YOU NEED--
FLOUR, SUGAR?

38:29.408 --> 38:32.511
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT
KAREN McCLUSKEY TELLS YOU.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.683
SHE'S AN OLD WOMAN--
PRACTICALLY SENILE.

38:34.683 --> 38:36.685
SHE DIDN'T SOUND SENILE
TO ME.

38:36.685 --> 38:39.388
DYLAN, MAYBE THIS IS NOT
THE TIME, OKAY?

38:39.388 --> 38:41.690
YOU SAID MY FATHER
DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ME,

38:41.690 --> 38:45.494
BUT SHE SAYS HE CAME HERE.
HE WANTED TO SEE ME.

38:45.494 --> 38:47.826
WHY WOULD YOU NOT
TELL ME THAT?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.658
(front door opens)

38:49.658 --> 38:51.660
HE'S MY FATHER.
I DESERVE TO KNOW.

38:51.660 --> 38:54.663
THE ONLY THING YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT MAN

38:54.663 --> 38:57.005
IS HE WAS A MONSTER.

38:57.005 --> 39:00.739
I CAN DECIDE THAT FOR MYSELF.
WHERE IS HE?

39:00.739 --> 39:02.411
I DON'T KNOW.

39:02.411 --> 39:04.673
YOU'RE LYING.
 NO, SHE'S NOT.

39:04.673 --> 39:05.774
YES, SHE IS.

39:05.774 --> 39:09.117
SHE HAS BEEN LYING TO ME
MY WHOLE LIFE.

39:09.117 --> 39:12.050
I'M STARTING TO THINK
MAYBEYOU'RETHE MONSTER.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.122
(Dylan gasps)

39:18.687 --> 39:21.960
SHE CAN'T TALK TO ME
THAT WAY,

39:21.960 --> 39:24.463
NOT AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE FOR HER.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.465
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
THE PROBLEM.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.797
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR HER.

39:28.797 --> 39:31.500
NOBODY DOES,
AND IT'S GONNA STAY THAT WAY.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.042
ARE YOU SURE? SHE'S JUST
GONNA KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS.

39:34.042 --> 39:37.506
THEN WE'D BETTER START
COMING UP WITH BETTER LIES.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.566
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

39:57.566 --> 39:59.768
I WAS WONDERING
WHERE YOU'D GONE TO.

39:59.768 --> 40:01.770
I JUST LET MYSELF
INTO KATHERINE'S HOUSE

40:01.770 --> 40:03.472
TO GET THAT RECIPE.

40:03.472 --> 40:05.474
WELL, THAT SEEMS
A BIT EXTREME.

40:05.474 --> 40:06.935
(sets keys down)

40:06.935 --> 40:11.179
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU KNOW HER SECRET NOW.

40:11.179 --> 40:15.714
YES, AND IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH PIE.

40:20.689 --> 40:23.592
AHH. HERE'S THE THING.

40:23.592 --> 40:26.595
I GOT A REAL CHANCE AT GETTING
BACK TOGETHER WITH MY EX,

40:26.595 --> 40:29.498
BUT THIS WOMAN
IS STANDING IN MY WAY.

40:29.498 --> 40:32.501
AND SHE KNOWS ABOUT THE MONEY,
AND SHE'S MADE IT CLEAR

40:32.501 --> 40:35.504
THAT IF I LEAVE,
SHE'S GONNA BLOW THE WHISTLE.

40:38.006 --> 40:40.769
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND...

40:40.769 --> 40:44.172
I REALLY DID CARE
FOR EDIE,

40:44.172 --> 40:46.745
BUT I CAN'T LET HER
RUIN MY LIFE.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.451
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

41:02.831 --> 41:03.892
(all laughing)

41:03.892 --> 41:05.994
YOU GUYS, WE BETTER BEHAVE,

41:05.994 --> 41:08.597
OR THE NURSES
ARE GONNA KICK US OUT.

41:08.597 --> 41:12.971
HEY, IT'S OUR CHEMO PARTY,
AND WE'LL LAUGH IF WE WANT TO.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.973
GABY, THIS WAS
A WONDERFUL IDEA.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.976
I CANNOT TELL YOU
HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.949
WELL, DON'T GET SAPPY ON ME.
I WON'T STAND FOR IT.

41:20.949 --> 41:22.851
ALL RIGHT, SUSAN,
IS THE CAMERA READY?

41:22.851 --> 41:24.553
YEAH.
 GOT IT.

41:24.553 --> 41:26.555
OKAY, ONCE THE LIGHT
STARTS BLINKING,

41:26.555 --> 41:27.856
WE'VE GOT THREE SECONDS,

41:27.856 --> 41:30.559
SO, EVERYBODY, SAY, "CHEESE"
AND HOLD IT.

41:30.559 --> 41:31.560
OKAY.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.861
ONE, TWO, THREE.

41:32.861 --> 41:34.893
(all) CHEESE!

41:34.893 --> 41:38.627
THERE IS NOTHING MORE DECEPTIVE
THAN A SMILE,

41:38.627 --> 41:40.629
AND NO ONE KNOWS THIS BETTER

41:40.629 --> 41:44.673
THAN THE PEOPLE
WHO HIDE BEHIND THEM.

41:44.673 --> 41:47.676
SOME FLASH THEIR TEETH
AS A POLITE WARNING

41:47.676 --> 41:49.538
TO THEIR ENEMIES.

41:49.538 --> 41:54.843
SOME PUT ON BEAMING FACES TO
KEEP THEIR TEARS FROM FALLING.

41:54.843 --> 41:57.746
OTHERS WEAR SILLY GRINS
TO MASK THEIR FEAR.

41:57.746 --> 41:59.618
MM!

41:59.618 --> 42:01.590
(all laughing)

42:01.590 --> 42:04.953
BUT THEN
THERE IS THAT RARE SMILE

42:04.953 --> 42:06.825
THAT IS ACTUALLY GENUINE.

42:08.857 --> 42:10.859
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

42:10.859 --> 42:14.663
IT'S THE SMILE OF A PERSON
WHO KNOWS HIS TROUBLES

42:14.663 --> 42:16.665
WILL SOON BE OVER.
