three dollars a day,

five days a week, that's $15,

00:44.734 --> 00:48.100

so that'd be $60.

the hair scrunchies?

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
Two scrunchies.

Okay, so that's one over two.

Now, what's a quarter of
the scrunchies?

11:25.066 --> 11:26.066
One scrunchy?

11:26.500 --> 11:28.333
Good. So that's one over four.

Now how many times does one scrunchy
go into two scrunchies?

11:32.166 --> 11:33.166
Two.

Excellent. So, let's look at
the problem.
