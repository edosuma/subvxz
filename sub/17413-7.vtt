WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:06.868
I'm so happy we finished all
those songs for your album.

00:06.902 --> 00:09.837
And I'm so happy we can work
on some songs for you now.

00:09.872 --> 00:12.540
Well, I'm so happy that
you two are happy.

00:12.574 --> 00:14.842
But for the record,
I am not happy.

00:14.877 --> 00:16.744
What's wrong?

00:16.779 --> 00:19.681
I lost the raffle for the
thousand dollar gift card

00:19.715 --> 00:21.482
at the animal print emporium.

00:21.517 --> 00:22.750
These tickets are garbage.

00:22.785 --> 00:23.851
I don't get it.

00:23.886 --> 00:25.586
There were only a
hundred raffle tickets

00:25.621 --> 00:27.488
and you bought 99 of them.

00:27.523 --> 00:29.657
I know. Who the heck beat me?

00:29.692 --> 00:30.758
I won!

00:32.695 --> 00:33.905
I got a thousand
dollar gift card

00:33.929 --> 00:35.530
to the animal print emporium.

00:35.564 --> 00:37.532
The hot spot for spots.

00:37.566 --> 00:39.567
You don't even
wear animal print.

00:39.601 --> 00:40.702
Well, I might start.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.671
In fact, check out this
Jaguar-print backpack.

00:43.706 --> 00:45.773
So chic. Rawr.

00:46.975 --> 00:48.743
Can you guys keep it down?

00:48.777 --> 00:50.712
Between your bickering
and that backpack,

00:50.746 --> 00:52.613
it's a little loud in here.

00:56.652 --> 00:58.553
So Austin, what do
you think of this?

01:05.661 --> 01:07.462
I love it.

01:07.496 --> 01:09.464
Let's try this for the melody.

01:14.903 --> 01:17.505
Perfect.

01:17.539 --> 01:19.640
Promise me no matter how
big our careers get,

01:19.675 --> 01:20.852
we'll always write
songs together.

01:20.876 --> 01:22.643
I promise.

01:23.712 --> 01:25.613
Ronnie Ramone, what
are you doing here?

01:25.647 --> 01:26.825
Let me get right to the point.

01:26.849 --> 01:29.684
Ally, we at Ramone Records
love your new songs.

01:29.718 --> 01:31.563
It's time to start talking
about releasing your album.

01:31.587 --> 01:32.787
- Congrats!
- That's awesome!

01:32.821 --> 01:34.822
It's about time.

01:34.857 --> 01:36.657
This is so exciting.

01:36.692 --> 01:37.859
Thank you so much, Ronnie.

01:37.893 --> 01:39.694
Hey, don't tell me you're
working on a new hit

01:39.728 --> 01:40.728
for me right now?

01:40.763 --> 01:41.829
She won't,

01:41.864 --> 01:43.731
because it's not
what she's doing.

01:43.766 --> 01:45.967
Actually, we're working
on a new hit for Austin.

01:46.001 --> 01:47.568
Oh, that's lovely.

01:47.603 --> 01:48.680
Yeah, you can't do that anymore.

01:48.704 --> 01:50.605
What are you talking about?

01:50.639 --> 01:51.750
Let me get right to the point.

01:51.774 --> 01:53.741
Ally, you can't write
songs for Austin.

01:53.776 --> 01:55.510
Say what now?

01:55.544 --> 01:57.612
Hold the phone, Ramone.

01:57.646 --> 01:58.713
Care to tell us why?

01:58.747 --> 02:00.782
Sure, Ally is signed
with Ramone Records.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.483
Austin is signed
with Starr Records.

02:02.518 --> 02:03.785
I have a policy.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.620
No helping the competition.

02:05.654 --> 02:08.455
But we have to write together.
We're partners.

02:08.490 --> 02:09.601
Let me get right to the point.

02:09.625 --> 02:10.901
You know, you'd get to
the point a lot faster

02:10.925 --> 02:13.828
if you stopped saying "Let
me get right to the point."

02:13.862 --> 02:16.631
Ally, if you continue
to write for Austin,

02:16.665 --> 02:18.466
I'll drop you from my label.

02:21.503 --> 02:23.604
Okay.

02:23.639 --> 02:25.807
Let's all take a deep breath.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.742
Trish is a good manager.

02:27.776 --> 02:28.887
I'm sure she's
already come up with

02:28.911 --> 02:31.546
a brilliant solution to
get us out of this mess.

02:31.580 --> 02:32.547
Right, Trish?

02:32.581 --> 02:34.715
Let me get right to the point.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.585

03:33.942 --> 03:35.877
I've written songs for Austin

03:35.911 --> 03:38.746
since the day we met.
It's how we connect.

03:38.780 --> 03:40.781
I'm worried if we lose that,

03:40.816 --> 03:42.950
it could hurt more than
just our partnership.

03:42.985 --> 03:47.488
Are you sure this isn't about
more than just your partnership?

03:47.522 --> 03:49.957
Yeah, that's exactly
what I just said.

03:49.992 --> 03:52.627
Sorry, I'm not a good listener.

03:52.661 --> 03:53.895
But don't worry.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.596
Austin's talking to Jimmy.

03:55.631 --> 03:56.931
I'm sure there's a solution.

03:56.965 --> 03:58.599
There's no solution.

03:58.634 --> 04:00.601
Jimmy said it's Ronnie's label

04:00.636 --> 04:01.769
and he can do what he wants.

04:01.803 --> 04:03.738
He also said that these
leopard suspenders

04:03.772 --> 04:04.839
don't go with these pants.

04:04.873 --> 04:07.775
So... What does he know?

04:07.809 --> 04:10.678
First of all, nothing
goes with those pants.

04:10.712 --> 04:13.447
And second, those
aren't leopard.

04:13.482 --> 04:14.615
They're Asian cheetah.

04:14.650 --> 04:17.485
I should have gotten
that gift card.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.521
It just doesn't seem fair that
we can't write together anymore.

04:21.555 --> 04:22.790
Well, don't just give up.

04:22.824 --> 04:24.558
You march into Ronnie's office

04:24.593 --> 04:26.571
and insist that you're gonna
keep writing for Austin.

04:26.595 --> 04:27.929
But I could lose my record deal.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.697
I don't want that to happen.

04:29.731 --> 04:31.011
You've worked too hard for this.

04:32.601 --> 04:33.801
Don't worry, Ally.

04:33.835 --> 04:35.503
You don't need Austin.

04:35.537 --> 04:36.771
You can write, you can sing.

04:36.805 --> 04:37.872
You'll be fine.

04:37.906 --> 04:40.474
But Austin can't write,

04:40.509 --> 04:42.777
so his career is over.

04:43.845 --> 04:45.613
You had a great run, buddy.

04:45.647 --> 04:48.649
I did, didn't I?

04:48.684 --> 04:49.817
Wait.

04:57.693 --> 04:58.726
Hey, Trish.

04:58.760 --> 04:59.961
<i>Oh.</i>

04:59.995 --> 05:01.762
Like my hat?

05:01.797 --> 05:04.598
Got it at the animal
print emporium.

05:04.633 --> 05:07.902
With my gift card
did you didn't win.

05:07.936 --> 05:09.770
Why'd you even
enter that raffle?

05:09.805 --> 05:11.605
Animal prints are my thing.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.441
And raffles are my thing.

05:13.475 --> 05:14.909
It's the first one I ever won.

05:14.943 --> 05:15.943
Or entered.

05:17.479 --> 05:18.546
Just give me the hat.

05:18.580 --> 05:20.848
Wouldn't you rather have...
the card?

05:21.917 --> 05:24.618
Oh, nice try.

05:25.687 --> 05:27.888
I have a proposition.

05:27.923 --> 05:31.625
I will give you the
card in one week.

05:32.661 --> 05:33.728
What's the catch?

05:33.762 --> 05:36.464
Each time you insult
me during said week,

05:36.498 --> 05:38.699
I will go back to the
store and buy more stuff.

05:38.734 --> 05:39.934
The nicer you are,

05:39.968 --> 05:42.503
the more money you'll
have left on the card.

05:42.537 --> 05:44.638
All right.

05:44.673 --> 05:46.474
It's just one week.

05:46.508 --> 05:47.475
I could be nice to you.

05:47.509 --> 05:48.709
Yes!

05:48.744 --> 05:49.810
Doofus.

05:52.514 --> 05:53.748
Okay, I'll be nice.

05:53.782 --> 05:55.549
You'd better be. 'Cause
you're now down to

05:55.584 --> 05:57.485
$843.

05:59.855 --> 06:02.757
So, you ready to start
auditioning new songwriters?

06:02.791 --> 06:04.825
- I guess so.
- Yeah,

06:04.860 --> 06:05.903
but it's not gonna be easy.

06:05.927 --> 06:07.828
You worried you're not
gonna find somebody?

06:07.863 --> 06:10.431
No, I'm worried even if I do,

06:10.465 --> 06:12.700
it won't be as special as
what I have with Ally.

06:12.734 --> 06:14.602
I know.

06:14.636 --> 06:15.836
I feel the same way.

07:45.594 --> 07:48.696
Why? The mariachi
guy was amazing.

07:48.730 --> 07:51.899
Dez, you are such a...

07:51.933 --> 07:53.534
Sweet and charming boy.

07:55.504 --> 07:56.937
Well, I gotta watch the store.

07:56.972 --> 07:59.607
Don't worry, Austin.

07:59.641 --> 08:00.721
We'll figure something out.

08:04.779 --> 08:07.581
We'll never find a
songwriter to replace Ally.

08:07.616 --> 08:09.416
Well, there's one more left.

08:09.451 --> 08:11.719
Someone named Roxy
Rocket left this song.

08:11.753 --> 08:12.753
May as well look at it.

08:14.789 --> 08:17.525

Great melody, strong lyrics.

08:41.816 --> 08:43.484
She really gets my style.

08:43.518 --> 08:45.786
Well, I think we just found
your new songwriter.

08:45.820 --> 08:48.822
From now on, it's gonna
be Austin and Roxy.

08:48.857 --> 08:50.691
Huh.

08:50.725 --> 08:52.459
It's weird to hear that.

08:52.494 --> 08:54.461
I guess you're right.

08:54.496 --> 08:56.463
This is the end of
Austin and Ally.

08:57.899 --> 09:01.602
So... It's a definite
"no" on the mariachi?

09:08.610 --> 09:09.777
No taste.

09:18.072 --> 09:19.973
Ally, we have some news.

09:20.008 --> 09:21.018
Do you want me to tell her?

09:21.042 --> 09:24.044
No, I should be the one.

09:24.078 --> 09:25.912
Ally, we...

09:25.947 --> 09:27.848
Found someone way
better than you.

09:28.950 --> 09:30.884
Dez!

09:30.918 --> 09:31.918
So who'd you pick?

09:31.953 --> 09:33.820
Her name's Roxy Rocket.

09:33.855 --> 09:35.989
She wrote an awesome song.

09:36.024 --> 09:37.891
Austin and Roxy, huh?

09:37.925 --> 09:39.793
Well, congrats. I'm
happy for you.

09:39.827 --> 09:41.928
You should call Roxy and
give her the good news.

09:41.963 --> 09:43.730
Here. She left her number.

09:49.203 --> 09:50.904
Hello?

09:50.938 --> 09:53.740
Hi, is this Roxy Rocket?

09:53.775 --> 09:55.008
This is Roxy.

09:55.043 --> 09:57.044
This is Austin Moon.

09:57.078 --> 09:59.079
I loved your song

09:59.113 --> 10:01.014
and I want you to be
my new songwriter.

10:01.049 --> 10:02.749
Really? That's great.

10:02.784 --> 10:03.784
I would love to be...

10:03.818 --> 10:04.785
Ally, can you keep it down?

10:04.819 --> 10:05.819
I'm on the phone.

10:06.988 --> 10:09.089
Sorry, Roxy, my
friend's being rude.

10:09.123 --> 10:12.759
Anyway, I think we'd
make a great team.

10:12.794 --> 10:13.994
Roxy?

10:16.864 --> 10:18.932
I think we'd make
an amazing team.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.101
You're Roxy Rocket?!

10:21.135 --> 10:23.036
Yep. I couldn't
stand the thought

10:23.071 --> 10:24.871
of not writing with you anymore.

10:24.906 --> 10:26.239
But if I write under an alias

10:26.274 --> 10:27.874
like Roxy Rocket,

10:27.909 --> 10:29.253
then Ronnie will
never know it's me.

10:29.277 --> 10:31.812
That's genius.

10:31.846 --> 10:33.213
But, Ally, it's not like you

10:33.247 --> 10:36.783
to be so devious and deceitful.

10:36.818 --> 10:37.884
I'm so proud of you.

10:40.988 --> 10:44.057
So let me get this straight.

10:44.092 --> 10:46.126
You're name is actually Roxy,

10:46.160 --> 10:48.895
and this whole time you've
been pretending to be Ally

10:48.930 --> 10:50.330
so you can write
songs with Austin?

10:52.900 --> 10:54.211
I'll explain it to
you later, Dez.

10:54.235 --> 10:57.971
Well, Roxy, want to
play this new song?

10:58.005 --> 10:59.072
I'd love to.

11:02.944 --> 11:06.747
♪ Girl, you could be my ♪

11:06.781 --> 11:10.083
♪ Once in a lifetime ♪

11:10.118 --> 11:14.755
♪ If you open up your heart ♪

11:14.789 --> 11:17.958
<i>♪ Show me who you are ♪</i>

11:17.992 --> 11:22.095
<i>♪ show me who you are ♪</i>

11:22.130 --> 11:25.098
<i>♪ show me who you are. ♪</i>

11:25.133 --> 11:26.967
<i>That was Austin
Moon's latest hit</i>

11:27.001 --> 11:29.102
<i>"who u r," written by
his new songwriter</i>

11:29.137 --> 11:31.004
<i>- Roxy Rocket.
- That's you.</i>

11:31.038 --> 11:33.073
<i>Tune into video countdown
live this week.</i>

11:33.107 --> 11:35.108
<i>We'll be broadcasting
life from shredder's.</i>

11:35.143 --> 11:37.944
<i>And see if Austin and Roxy
can take that top spot.</i>

11:37.979 --> 11:39.946
I know we're gonna
take the top spot,

11:39.981 --> 11:41.882
'cause Roxy wrote a hit song.

11:41.916 --> 11:43.216
Thanks. I'll tell her.

11:44.919 --> 11:46.820
Dez, what's with the scarf?

11:46.854 --> 11:48.121
Oh, you like it?

11:48.156 --> 11:50.023
I got it yesterday
after Trish called me

11:50.057 --> 11:51.124
count dorkula.

11:52.260 --> 11:54.127
It's 50% cheetah print,

11:54.162 --> 11:56.797
50% leopard, and 50% ocelot.

11:59.167 --> 12:00.767
Did I say dorkula?

12:00.802 --> 12:02.068
I meant freakenstein.

12:02.103 --> 12:03.170
Darn it.

12:05.773 --> 12:07.084
You'd better behave
yourself, Trish.

12:07.108 --> 12:09.743
'Cause the cash flow
is getting low.

12:13.214 --> 12:14.214
Hey, check it out.

12:14.248 --> 12:16.149
Everyone on the
Austin Moon fan page

12:16.184 --> 12:17.951
wants to know all about Roxy.

12:17.985 --> 12:19.920
What should I write?

12:19.954 --> 12:21.221
What do they want to know?

12:21.255 --> 12:24.124
Uh, where's she from?
What's she like?

12:24.158 --> 12:25.926
No one knows who Roxy is,

12:25.960 --> 12:28.094
so we could make up
whatever we want.

12:28.129 --> 12:30.030
Let's make her the
opposite of Ally.

12:30.064 --> 12:32.232
Tall, super confident,
a good dancer.

12:32.266 --> 12:33.934
Hey!

12:33.968 --> 12:35.101
But I like that. Put that in.

12:37.905 --> 12:39.973
All right. Let's read
back what we posted.

12:40.007 --> 12:43.810
Okay, so Roxy is a tall,
confident fashionista.

12:43.845 --> 12:45.178
She's also an
award-winning dancer

12:45.213 --> 12:46.913
who's not afraid
to speak her mind.

12:46.948 --> 12:48.882
And she's a Swedish pop punk

12:48.916 --> 12:50.951
with pink and blonde
checkerboard hair.

12:50.985 --> 12:52.819
Yep, that's me.

12:54.155 --> 12:55.121
Wait.

12:55.156 --> 12:58.925
That's you Ally, or
that's you Roxy?

12:58.960 --> 13:02.162
I'll explain it to you later...
Again.

13:09.770 --> 13:10.804
Hey.

13:10.838 --> 13:11.915
How was your lunch
meeting with Jimmy?

13:11.939 --> 13:13.039
It was fine.

13:13.074 --> 13:15.742
Till I ordered that
third lobster to go.

13:15.776 --> 13:17.878
Sometimes I get the feeling
Jimmy doesn't like me.

13:17.912 --> 13:19.012
Why? Did he say something?

13:19.046 --> 13:20.914
Yeah, he said, "Dez,
I don't like you."

13:23.050 --> 13:24.751
Ally, we've got a problem.

13:24.785 --> 13:25.886
Jimmy loves the new song.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.787
And that's a problem because...?

13:27.822 --> 13:28.922
He asked about Roxy.

13:28.956 --> 13:31.224
Please tell me he doesn't
want to meet her.

13:31.259 --> 13:32.893
It's worse than that.

13:32.927 --> 13:34.995
He booked me and Roxy to
be on video countdown live

13:35.029 --> 13:35.996
tomorrow.

13:36.030 --> 13:37.230
What?!

13:37.265 --> 13:40.100
You get to be Roxy on live TV.

13:40.134 --> 13:43.770
Or as Roxy would say

13:54.851 --> 13:56.552
I thought since Roxy's Swedish,

13:56.586 --> 13:58.731
eating Swedish meatballs will
help you get into character.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.290
Can't argue with that logic.

14:01.324 --> 14:03.292
Just eat one and
try your accent.

14:07.330 --> 14:11.367
That's one good meatball.

14:13.737 --> 14:16.672
Hmm. Maybe these are
Italian meatballs.

14:16.707 --> 14:19.308
Austin, I can't do
a Swedish accent.

14:19.342 --> 14:20.376
Or Italian.

14:22.345 --> 14:23.479
This is never going to work.

14:23.513 --> 14:25.347
I should just admit
I made Roxy up

14:25.382 --> 14:26.659
and hope Ronnie Ramone
doesn't drop me.

14:26.683 --> 14:28.484
No, you can't take that chance.

14:28.518 --> 14:30.419
You have to go through
with being Roxy.

14:31.455 --> 14:33.656
If you lost your record
deal because of me,

14:33.690 --> 14:36.325
I could never look
myself in the mirror.

14:36.359 --> 14:38.327
And I love looking at
myself in the mirror.

14:40.363 --> 14:41.363
What's up?

14:52.709 --> 14:55.411
Check out my cow print boots.

14:55.445 --> 14:56.779
Moo!

14:58.582 --> 15:01.617
The gift card's
down to 713 bucks.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.519
You shouldn't have
made fun of me.

15:03.553 --> 15:05.521
But you've been wearing
underwear over your pants

15:05.555 --> 15:06.622
all day.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.290
I had no choice.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.291
There was a hole in my pants

15:09.326 --> 15:10.292
and if you looked through,

15:10.327 --> 15:11.594
you could see my underwear!

15:11.628 --> 15:15.431
But now your underwear's...
never mind.

15:17.467 --> 15:20.603
May I present Roxy Rocket.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.785
Is my Swedish accent okay?

15:35.819 --> 15:38.320
Nope.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.565
Just let me do all the talking.

15:39.589 --> 15:44.393
<i>Ja. That is probably
a good idea.</i>

15:44.427 --> 15:45.694
Oh brother.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.565
Hey hey.

15:49.599 --> 15:52.468
You ready to do some live TV?

15:52.502 --> 15:54.336
Uh, actually we need a couple...

15:54.371 --> 15:56.605
and we're live on
video countdown live.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.574
Joining us this week
are Austin Moon

15:58.608 --> 15:59.742
and fresh out of Sweden,

15:59.776 --> 16:03.279
new songwriting
sensation, Roxy Rocket.

16:03.313 --> 16:04.613
So Roxy,

16:04.648 --> 16:06.348
what's it like
working with Austin?

16:06.383 --> 16:08.384
It's great working with me.

16:08.418 --> 16:10.286
I'm an amazing
person to work with.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.554
I was asking Roxy.

16:11.588 --> 16:14.623
So, how do you like
working with Austin?

16:14.658 --> 16:16.458
<i>Ja.</i>

16:18.662 --> 16:21.297
Okay.

16:21.331 --> 16:22.498
It says here in your bio

16:22.532 --> 16:23.632
that you're kind of sassy.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.768
You're known for
speaking your mind.

16:25.802 --> 16:28.370
What's the craziest
thing you've ever said?

16:28.405 --> 16:29.538
<i>Ja.</i>

16:31.374 --> 16:33.309
You see that?

16:33.343 --> 16:34.476
No filter at all.

16:34.511 --> 16:36.445
You never know what
she's gonna say.

16:36.479 --> 16:38.747
Well, you certainly
are different from

16:38.782 --> 16:41.650
Austin's last songwriter,
Ally Dawson, aren't you?

16:41.685 --> 16:44.353
<i>Ja. Different.</i>

16:44.387 --> 16:46.355
Not the same person at all.

16:47.691 --> 16:50.659
Well, Austin, I think
I like this new song

16:50.694 --> 16:53.495
better than any of the
songs you wrote with Ally.

16:53.530 --> 16:55.764
Excuse me?

16:55.799 --> 16:57.766
Well, Roxy, you just
bring this fire

16:57.801 --> 16:59.735
that Ally never had,

16:59.769 --> 17:01.537
and I think you're more
talented than her.

17:02.572 --> 17:04.406
What?

17:04.441 --> 17:06.275
Ally is brilliant.

17:06.309 --> 17:08.676
You have no idea what
you are talking about.

17:08.712 --> 17:10.445
I think I do.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.723
You bring something
fresh to the table,

17:11.748 --> 17:12.714
and the song is a hit,

17:12.749 --> 17:14.750
so obviously the people agree.

17:17.654 --> 17:19.555
Ally was also fresh.

17:19.589 --> 17:21.624
Some might even say
that Ally and Roxy

17:21.657 --> 17:25.327
had the same amount
of fr-freshness.

17:25.362 --> 17:26.694
Well, in my opinion,

17:26.730 --> 17:30.299
Ally Dawson wasn't such an important
part of your success after all.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.368
She was overrated.

17:32.402 --> 17:33.636
What do you know?

17:33.670 --> 17:35.337
You don't write music.

17:35.372 --> 17:37.606
You just sit there with your
over-gelled swoopy hair

17:37.641 --> 17:38.607
and read stupid questions

17:38.642 --> 17:39.642
off of stupid cards.

17:40.777 --> 17:43.312
Another interesting
fact about Roxy

17:43.346 --> 17:44.647
is when she gets angry,

17:44.681 --> 17:46.649
she talks in an American accent.

17:46.683 --> 17:48.651
<i>Ja.</i>

17:48.685 --> 17:50.319
And another thing.

17:50.353 --> 17:51.487
Ally has worked too hard

17:51.521 --> 17:54.356
to be treated with
such disrespect.

17:54.391 --> 17:56.425
Am I right, Miami?

17:57.560 --> 17:58.527
Roxy, Roxy, Roxy!

17:58.561 --> 18:01.430
See, this is what I
was talking about.

18:01.464 --> 18:04.266
It's exactly that kind
of fire that Ally lacks.

18:04.301 --> 18:05.534
I'll show you fire.

18:05.568 --> 18:07.603
Whoa whoa!

18:07.637 --> 18:09.505
Thanks for having us
on the show, Jett.

18:09.539 --> 18:11.440
It was good times.

18:11.474 --> 18:13.342
Good times.

18:13.376 --> 18:14.510
Good night, Miami.

18:23.653 --> 18:24.653
Whoo!

18:26.389 --> 18:27.389
What's gotten into you?

18:27.424 --> 18:28.624
I don't know.

18:28.658 --> 18:30.759
Being Roxy just makes
me feel so powerful.

18:33.730 --> 18:35.531
I think it's great.

18:35.565 --> 18:37.666
Roxy reminds me a lot of me,

18:37.701 --> 18:40.369
before I started the
whole being nice thing.

18:41.471 --> 18:43.439
Ronnie, what are you doing here?

18:43.473 --> 18:44.517
Let me get right to the point.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.742
Roxy, I like your moxy.

18:46.776 --> 18:49.478
I'd like to hire you to
work with my new artist

18:49.512 --> 18:50.479
Ally Dawson.

18:50.513 --> 18:52.314
That's great.

18:52.349 --> 18:53.415
I can't wait to tell Ally.

18:54.751 --> 18:56.485
No need. I'm gonna
call her right now

18:56.519 --> 18:57.799
and arrange for you two to meet.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.665
Roxy, are you gonna get that?

19:11.301 --> 19:12.534
Wait a minute.

19:16.639 --> 19:17.639
Ally?

19:17.674 --> 19:19.742
You're Roxy?

19:19.776 --> 19:21.643
Ally is Roxy?

19:21.678 --> 19:24.546
I had no idea.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.449
I'm just as shocked as you are.

19:27.484 --> 19:29.451
I'll explain it to you later.

19:31.488 --> 19:33.655
You wrote that song for Austin?

19:33.690 --> 19:35.424
Ronnie, wait.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.698
Don't drop her from your label.

19:36.726 --> 19:38.460
It's not her fault.

19:38.495 --> 19:39.775
Ally was just trying to help me.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.698
Austin, I'll handle this.

19:42.732 --> 19:44.633
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.635
I picked up a few
things from Roxy,

19:46.669 --> 19:47.669
like her moxy.

19:49.339 --> 19:50.706
Ronnie, writing songs for Austin

19:50.740 --> 19:52.508
makes me a better artist,

19:52.542 --> 19:54.543
and that's the
artist you signed.

19:54.577 --> 19:56.412
So let me get right
to the point.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.380
I will continue writing
songs for Austin,

19:58.415 --> 19:59.658
you will not drop
me from the label

19:59.682 --> 20:01.417
and you're gonna like it!

20:01.451 --> 20:02.584
Yeah, you tell him, Ally.

20:05.789 --> 20:08.757
Hey, no one talks to
Ronnie Ramone like that.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.660
I'm impressed.

20:11.694 --> 20:13.328
And a little frightened.

20:14.397 --> 20:16.331
Look, Ally,

20:16.366 --> 20:18.667
I'd rather let you keep
writing for Austin

20:18.701 --> 20:20.436
than lose you as an artist.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.670
Really?

20:21.704 --> 20:23.739
Thank you, Ronnie. You
will not regret it.

20:23.773 --> 20:24.773
I better not.

20:26.709 --> 20:29.411
I guess this is the end
of Austin and Roxy.

20:29.446 --> 20:31.380
But Austin and Ally are back.

20:32.749 --> 20:35.517
Aw, I love happy endings.

20:38.721 --> 20:41.423
<i>Look what you did, you...</i>

20:41.458 --> 20:44.426
<i>You are such a clumsy little...</i>

20:44.461 --> 20:46.395
you know what you are?
You're a...

20:46.429 --> 20:47.629
and a...

20:47.664 --> 20:49.631
you're the biggest
On this planet!

20:49.666 --> 20:51.533
Even on your best days,

20:51.568 --> 20:52.568
you're a...

20:52.602 --> 20:54.736
I can't believe you
did this, you...

21:02.479 --> 21:05.581
so, what do you think?

21:05.615 --> 21:08.450
You look ridiculous.

21:08.485 --> 21:09.718
Thanks.

21:09.752 --> 21:12.321
That's what I was going for.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.655
Austin, there you are.

21:13.690 --> 21:14.723
Where's Roxy?

21:14.757 --> 21:17.659
Oh... Roxy?

21:17.694 --> 21:21.697
She suddenly moved
back to Sweden.

21:21.731 --> 21:22.731
Oh, that's too bad.

21:22.765 --> 21:24.666
The show got monster ratings

21:24.701 --> 21:25.801
because of her.

21:25.835 --> 21:27.646
Maybe I should call her and
ask her to come back on?

21:27.670 --> 21:28.804
Sorry.

21:28.838 --> 21:30.672
Unfortunately, she's
in a part of Sweden

21:30.707 --> 21:33.408
that doesn't get cell service.

21:33.443 --> 21:35.444
Oh, and she quit music forever.

21:35.478 --> 21:38.347
That's too bad. She
was very talented...

21:38.381 --> 21:39.815
But not as talented as you.

21:39.849 --> 21:41.483
I saw the show, Jett.

21:41.518 --> 21:43.385
Awkward.

21:45.622 --> 21:46.765
If you're looking
for some talent,

21:46.789 --> 21:48.690
may I suggest the
musical stylings of

21:48.725 --> 21:51.527
señor Dez and guillermo.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.562
Guillermo!

22:18.488 --> 22:19.488
One more time.

22:20.305 --> 22:26.743
