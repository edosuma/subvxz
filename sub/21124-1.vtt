with window coverings.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.303
Well, I'm from London, so... [chuckles]

12:42.386 --> 12:44.221
-I don't know what that means.
-Yeah.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.724
-Your eyes are closed.
-That's what happens when you blow.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.642
-Can you blow with your eyes open?
-Okay.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.522
Resume gets a little thin after 1979.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.151
-Movies get a little white after 1979.
-Mm-hmm.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.361
You've seen my stunts.
I can kick. I can punch.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.696
I can do horse work, car work...

13:00.780 --> 13:03.157
Yeah, I know you can double,
but can you act?

13:04.366 --> 13:05.576
Freeze, motherfucker.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.038
-Next.
-Wow.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.499
Yeah. I'm gonna need you to do that, too.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.334
[chuckles]

13:16.128 --> 13:16.962
What is that?

13:22.718 --> 13:24.678
-Here.
-Look at you. You're like the parade.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.722
-Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

13:26.805 --> 13:27.890
I throw things.

13:28.098 --> 13:31.644
-Do you think you could throw people?
-Yeah.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.896
All right. Well, come back tomorrow.

13:34.855 --> 13:35.814
-[Reggie] Yeah.
-[Sam] Whoa.

13:35.898 --> 13:39.026
We're hairstylists at the Carlton Salon
at the Beverly Center.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.362
Our clients think we're funny
and should be on television.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.072
-You get two for one.
-I'm exhausted.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.156
[Sam] How old are you?

13:45.282 --> 13:46.116
Nineteen.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.245
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.121
Okay. We'll see.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.626
Yeah. Come on.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.923
Ruth Wilder. Looks like you.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.466
Yeah. It's a headshot.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.302
Oh. Strindberg. Who the fuck is that?

14:06.887 --> 14:09.431
-Oh, it's a playwright.
-I'm kidding. I know who Strindberg is.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.558
I'm not an idiot.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.017
So, what are you, like a--

14:12.101 --> 14:13.018
Like a real actor?

14:13.811 --> 14:14.645
Yeah.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.815
I've done a bunch of plays in Omaha,

14:17.898 --> 14:19.984
at a little spot called
the Blue Barn Theatre.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.528
I did a film a few years back.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.324
I've also done extensive mask work
and clowning workshops.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.370
How much acting will there be?

14:31.453 --> 14:32.329
As opposed to what?

14:33.414 --> 14:34.373
Hair pulling?

14:34.456 --> 14:37.585
-You don't like wrestling?
-Well, I don't really know wrestling.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.128
You don't think wrestling is acting?

14:39.837 --> 14:41.505
It's not, is it? It's--

14:41.922 --> 14:44.425
It's more like a sport with costumes?

14:45.175 --> 14:47.219
Or-- Sorry, are you--
Are you hiring actors

14:47.303 --> 14:49.972
to play wrestlers,
or are we the wrestlers?

14:50.055 --> 14:51.098
Yes.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.433
Which one?

14:54.226 --> 14:57.313
Do people think you're pretty?
Because, like, I'm looking at you...

14:58.105 --> 15:00.149
One second, I think,
"Fuck, yeah, she's hot,"

15:00.691 --> 15:04.153
and then the next second I'm like,
"I don't know. Is she? Really?"

15:04.236 --> 15:07.531
I mean, you just have one of those
faces that kind of... changes.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.991
Like, "Eh... Hmm."

15:10.284 --> 15:11.118
I don't know.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.371
-What the hell does that mean?
-It means I don't know.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.581
Ruth.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.082
Ruth.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.542
Ruth.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.085
That is not a great name.

15:20.669 --> 15:21.795
[sighs]

15:22.338 --> 15:24.089
Hey, guys. It's me.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.885
I really didn't wanna do this again,

15:27.968 --> 15:32.139
but, um... I need you guys to...
wire me $200

15:32.222 --> 15:34.141
so they don't turn off my phone...

15:34.934 --> 15:37.645
and so I can eat.

15:39.563 --> 15:40.856
I'm really sorry.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.192
I swear this is the last time.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.362
I love you.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.659
Oh, I, uh... got a call back.

15:51.992 --> 15:55.371
So, fingers crossed, again.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.331
Okay.

15:59.041 --> 15:59.875
Bye.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.342
[panting]

16:09.468 --> 16:11.595
Hello? Hello?

16:13.263 --> 16:14.223
I have mace!

16:14.306 --> 16:15.766
Wait. It's me.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.435
[gasps] Oh, my God!

16:19.478 --> 16:22.272
What are you doing?
Why are you climbing in my window?

16:22.356 --> 16:24.400
You said you didn't want anyone
to find out about us.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.111
- I took that seriously.
-No, no. Climb out. Go.

16:28.779 --> 16:29.655
Are you kidding me?

16:30.364 --> 16:33.200
You know how hard that was?
You ever tried to climb a trellis?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.326
Wh--?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.286
[exhales deeply]
I'm pretty proud of myself.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.497
For trying to cheat on your wife again?

16:38.580 --> 16:41.834
[sighs] Let's not-- Don't--
Please, can we not use those words?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.504
This isn't normal behavior for me.
[sighs]

16:46.463 --> 16:47.715
I just-- I can't...

16:48.924 --> 16:51.468
-I can't stop thinking about you.
-So?

16:52.344 --> 16:53.929
It was a huge mistake.

16:54.555 --> 16:58.475
And those drinks were free and--
And I was feeling sorry for myself,

16:58.559 --> 17:00.019
and you took advantage of that.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.563
I think we both took advantage of that.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.359
Please, go home to your family.

17:09.737 --> 17:13.365
I keep thinking about what you said
that night. About how there are...

17:13.449 --> 17:15.159
shiny people who have everything,

17:15.242 --> 17:17.161
and then there are people like us

17:17.244 --> 17:19.371
who have to go to parties
with those people

17:19.455 --> 17:22.708
and watch them get their pictures taken,
and it's not fair.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.252
Because we deserve stuff, too.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.880
We deserve attention.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.090
And...

17:30.466 --> 17:31.300
like...

17:34.136 --> 17:34.970
sex.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.642
[both moaning]

17:40.726 --> 17:41.727
Oh, my God.

17:41.810 --> 17:42.644
Ruth.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.980
You're-- You're amazing.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.023
Yeah, thank you.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.026
You're so real.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.444
Mm-mm.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.447
You-- Ow. Ah. Ha!

17:53.530 --> 17:56.033
You are the most real person
that I've ever been with.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.367
Okay.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.497
Shh. Shh.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.749
[both shushing]

18:07.795 --> 18:10.672
[both moaning]

18:11.256 --> 18:13.258
[Sam] Okay, over the next two days,

18:13.342 --> 18:16.345
I'm gonna be casting a squad of 12 women

18:16.428 --> 18:18.555
to play wrestlers on TV.

18:18.847 --> 18:21.892
Based on one, can you move,

18:22.017 --> 18:24.228
and can you follow basic direction?

18:24.520 --> 18:27.439
And two, do I like your face,

18:27.523 --> 18:29.900
-or do I not like your face?
-[murmuring]

18:30.442 --> 18:31.276
All right.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.446
If I call your number and say,
"Thank you,"

18:34.613 --> 18:35.447
you've been cut.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.284
So, dry your tears
and leave the ring quietly.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.579
Now, this hulking specimen over here

18:42.663 --> 18:44.289
is what--? What is it?

18:45.415 --> 18:46.750
Salty "The Sack" Johnson.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.711
Salty "The Sack" Johnson.
You've heard of him, right?

18:49.795 --> 18:53.006
He's the two-time champion
of... some stuff.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.301
All right, if you don't wanna leave here
with a broken spine,

18:56.385 --> 18:58.846
I suggest you listen to what
he has to say very carefully.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.472
All right, go ahead.

19:00.931 --> 19:01.765
Ladies...

19:02.432 --> 19:05.811
we're gonna go through the basics,
so, you need to focus.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.104
You heard the big man.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.523
Go ahead.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.526
First up, forward rolls.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.445
-[Sam] Whoa.
-Just like preschool.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.282
Not like preschool.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.492
Everyone off the ropes. Let's get to work.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.288
[Sam] You heard him.

19:26.623 --> 19:27.708
Oh, shit.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.917
What-- What the fuck?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.794
Who even, like, watches this sport?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.462
-I feel like--
-Uh, everyone.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.007
Even my nani watches <i>WWF Superstars.</i>

19:35.090 --> 19:37.050
She's 85, and she only speaks Hindi.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.764
Okay, number 18.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.349
Ugh.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.977
You remind me of my ex-wife. Thanks.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.607
He's already cutting people?
I thought this was just a warm-up.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.360
-Better make it count, then, right?
-[Salty] Next.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.071
Let's go. Come on.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.453
Oof-- Ah!

20:04.536 --> 20:05.621
Yes.

20:07.623 --> 20:08.457
Hi.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.631
[Ruth exhales]

20:18.050 --> 20:18.884
[sighs]

20:20.761 --> 20:22.679
Attack... the ropes.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.473
Do not be afraid.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.313
First two, get in.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.023
[Reggie] Good. All right.

20:33.148 --> 20:33.982
Let's go.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.319
[grunting]

20:39.446 --> 20:41.114
Ouch. Floor girl.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.909
Can't see your number... Bye.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.081
Yes! Still in the fuckin' game.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.208
Fuck yes!

20:51.291 --> 20:52.125
[yells]

21:09.851 --> 21:11.144
Oh, Christ.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.981
This throw is called the hair mare.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.527
[all gasp]

21:20.904 --> 21:21.738
Exactly.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.448
Let's go!

21:24.116 --> 21:25.117
Your turn, ladies.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.500
So, what's our backstory?

21:33.875 --> 21:34.710
Our what?

21:35.210 --> 21:36.336
What's motivating this?

21:36.420 --> 21:39.840
Why are we fighting? What's--
What's driving you to come after me

21:39.923 --> 21:42.718
and grab me by the hair
and throw me to the ground?

21:42.926 --> 21:43.969
It has to be something.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.429
He told us to.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.224
Look, there's still a lot of girls,

21:49.308 --> 21:52.561
which means anyone could be cut.
We have to go above and beyond.

21:53.145 --> 21:53.979
Trust me.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.065
-I'm an actress. I know what I'm doing.
-Okay.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.276
-Honey.
-[chuckles]

21:59.359 --> 22:00.944
The victim does all the work.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.447
You just gotta tug
on my hair a little bit.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.448
I'll do the rest.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.079
[women gasp]

22:11.163 --> 22:12.706
Nice. Good job, Cherry.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.668
-Cute outfit, Pippi Longstockings.
-[chuckles]

22:17.294 --> 22:18.128
[Salty] Next!

22:21.214 --> 22:23.008
-[growling]
-Get off of me!

22:26.219 --> 22:27.387
Creepy, but I like it.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.305
Next!

22:36.354 --> 22:37.189
Please!

22:38.482 --> 22:39.399
I beg you!

22:40.609 --> 22:42.486
I am not your enemy!

22:43.028 --> 22:44.071
You stole.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.655
Bread.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.950
-For my family.
-What the fuck is this?

22:49.534 --> 22:50.410
Just do the move.

22:50.994 --> 22:53.622
We are. We are.
We're just motivating it with backstory.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.793
There is a law--

22:57.876 --> 23:00.378
There is a law, and you broke it.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.006
And now, you will pay the ultimate price.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.843
Okay, all right. That's it.
Number 30, number 22, thank you.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.470
What?

23:08.595 --> 23:10.597
-Why?
-What do you mean, "Why?"

23:10.680 --> 23:13.350
I gave you basic direction.
You didn't follow it. You're both out.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.561
There are no scenes to read,

23:16.645 --> 23:19.856
no character work,
so, yes, we improvised.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.274
Jesus Christ.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.567
Fucking actresses.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.612
All right. I'm feeling generous.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.907
<i>Sophie's Choice.</i>
Why should I pick you and not her?

23:28.990 --> 23:30.117
Go. Girl fight.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.120
I'm a real actress.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.540
I will work my ass off,
and I will make you believe me

23:36.623 --> 23:38.875
when I do stuff,
even if it's just hair pulling.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.712
Well, that was a very nice pitch.
Very earnest. What about you?

23:45.048 --> 23:46.758
My dad's Goliath Jackson.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.135
Holy shit.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.177
Holy shit, why?

23:50.137 --> 23:51.471
He's a giant. I mean...

23:52.305 --> 23:56.768
he's a legend in the ring,
but he's also literally... gigantic.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.980
And the brothers, too.
Mighty Tom Jackson and Big Kurt Jackson.

24:00.063 --> 24:00.939
No shit.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.357
