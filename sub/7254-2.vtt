00:00.657 --> 00:02.597
Previously on
"Gilmore Girls"...

00:02.607 --> 00:04.960
I asked you to marry me.
And you said, "yes."

00:04.970 --> 00:06.733
- Just wait!
- It's now or never.

00:06.743 --> 00:08.688
I gave him an ultimatum.
And he said, "no."

00:08.698 --> 00:10.201
I can't wait to come
see you, Logan.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.871
Tell your mom you're not
gonna be home for Christmas.

00:11.901 --> 00:12.888
Christmas?

00:12.898 --> 00:13.966
It's over.

00:13.976 --> 00:15.876
You can't just decide
that it's over.

00:15.886 --> 00:18.391
I'm in this, too, you know.
And I'm not gonna let it be over.

00:18.403 --> 00:21.621
You said, "be ready now or never."
I'm ready now.

00:21.637 --> 00:23.683
I slept with Christopher.

02:42.339 --> 02:43.232
Morning, Rory.

02:43.248 --> 02:45.100
Please tell me you haven't
been standing there all night.

02:45.137 --> 02:46.271
I love you Rory.

02:46.287 --> 02:47.422
Creepy.

02:47.437 --> 02:49.832
- Ooh, waffles?
- Yes, I got up early this morning

02:49.847 --> 02:51.633
and I thought,
"what better way to pass time

02:51.645 --> 02:55.573
than make some of my
famous homemade waffles?"

02:55.587 --> 02:57.393
I can't believe I forgot
about your homemade waffles,

02:57.425 --> 02:58.591
seeing how famous they are.

02:58.605 --> 03:00.103
Infamous, really.

03:00.116 --> 03:01.392
So why'd you get up so early?

03:01.407 --> 03:02.913
Mm, well, couldn't sleep.

03:02.926 --> 03:05.060
And, initially,
I was at a loss.

03:05.077 --> 03:08.213
I mean, how would I pass the time
until my one and only offspring,

03:08.227 --> 03:10.622
- the fruit of my loins --
- Too early.

03:10.638 --> 03:12.450
...loin fruit that she is,

03:12.465 --> 03:15.181
straggled out of bed to
grace me with her presence?

03:15.196 --> 03:19.623
But then I asked
myself, "W.W.T.B.F.C.D.?"

03:19.635 --> 03:21.462
And it came to me in a flash.

03:21.485 --> 03:22.651
"I'm gonna make waffles."

03:22.666 --> 03:24.042
"What would the
barefoot contessa do?"

03:24.075 --> 03:25.083
Exactly.

03:25.098 --> 03:26.132
Barefoot's one word.

03:26.148 --> 03:27.403
Shut up, loin fruit.

03:27.417 --> 03:29.373
So, what? Are you just sleepy

03:29.385 --> 03:33.430
or has last night's "my boyfriend gave
me a love rocket" elation worn off?

03:33.447 --> 03:35.401
It may have worn
off a little bit.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.791
Why? What happened?

03:36.808 --> 03:39.580
The love rocket was making you
swoon for Logan last night.

03:39.596 --> 03:40.941
I'm still plenty swoony.

03:40.958 --> 03:43.803
I just realized that
the rocket doesn't mean

03:43.816 --> 03:45.821
I should be packing
my bags for London.

03:45.838 --> 03:47.180
Why? What happened?

03:47.196 --> 03:49.501
Nothing happend.
I just called Logan, and I was like,

03:49.518 --> 03:51.861
"yeah, yeah.
Oh, I love the love rocket, you know?

03:51.877 --> 03:52.993
And I can't wait
to come see you."

03:53.026 --> 03:55.150
And he was like,
"oh, yeah, me too.

03:55.167 --> 03:57.450
Um, I'm gonna buy you
a ticket for december."

03:57.467 --> 04:00.321
Oh, no. Did you tell him
you want to visit him now?

04:00.335 --> 04:02.933
There wasn't really a point,
you know, because I get it.

04:02.945 --> 04:05.112
He is starting his
first real job.

04:05.125 --> 04:08.820
I mean,
he needs time to adjust and focus

04:08.837 --> 04:10.283
and learn the lay of the land.

04:10.297 --> 04:12.553
I mean, it's good that he's trying
to be a grown-up, you know.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.990
So now I'm trying
to be a grown-up.

04:15.008 --> 04:18.510
So why am I gonna get all pouty
because I don't get to do it?

04:18.526 --> 04:19.630
Hmm.

04:19.647 --> 04:22.252
Well, that sounds like
a real grown-up talking.

04:22.265 --> 04:23.031
Thank you.

04:23.046 --> 04:25.340
You know the one thing that
grown-ups don't call themselves?

04:25.377 --> 04:26.232
What?

04:26.246 --> 04:27.522
Grown-ups.

04:27.535 --> 04:30.880
They say "adults," And they
pronounce it "ah-dults."

04:30.895 --> 04:33.183
- It stinks!
- Oh, it really stinks.

04:33.195 --> 04:34.243
Stupid London!

04:34.255 --> 04:37.101
If he weren't in London right now,
we would be on our Asia trip.

04:37.116 --> 04:40.123
I mean, I knew that it might not happen,
but I hoped it would,

04:40.138 --> 04:43.580
and I just kept planning
and planning and planning.

04:45.958 --> 04:49.711
Wow. Were you planning on
visiting Asia or invading it?

04:49.728 --> 04:51.163
Look at all this wasted effort.

04:51.178 --> 04:52.832
All this highlighter
ink? Wasted.

04:52.845 --> 04:54.783
All of these sticky
notes? Wasted.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.571
We were going to see the
terra-cotta soldiers in Xian.

04:57.586 --> 05:00.431
And we were going to go to Peking
for the opera and the duck.

05:00.445 --> 05:04.422
I want to see Tibet. I want to snorkel
off the an thoi islands in Vietnam.

05:04.436 --> 05:08.620
I want to see the crazy teenage fashions
in the harajuku district of Tokyo.

05:08.635 --> 05:10.163
Oh,  wow.

05:10.178 --> 05:11.573
Stupid London!

05:11.586 --> 05:14.011
- So, no Asia?
- No Asia.

05:14.025 --> 05:16.581
Well, I guess I got
to go to stupid work.

05:17.075 --> 05:18.771
Here's one good piece
of news, though.

05:18.787 --> 05:20.351
Lane called.
She's back from her honeymoon.

05:20.385 --> 05:21.891
- Oh, yay!
- Yeah.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.371
She sounded kind of tired,
which is good, I think.

05:24.386 --> 05:26.442
Tired after a
honeymoon bodes well.

05:26.455 --> 05:28.913
My married friend Lane and
her married husband Zach.

05:28.926 --> 05:30.001
Nutso.

05:30.017 --> 05:32.202
Hmm. Spoken like
a true grown-up.

05:32.328 --> 05:34.002
Say "hey" to her for me.

05:34.015 --> 05:35.203
It's nice to have you home.

05:35.215 --> 05:36.751
Bye.

05:50.447 --> 05:51.841
Morning, Luke.

05:52.306 --> 05:54.131
- You need a hand with this?
- Thanks.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.383
Sure thing.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.803
Just give me one second
to savor this coffee.

06:01.047 --> 06:02.803
So, how are you this
lovely morning?

06:02.816 --> 06:04.210
Just fine.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.811
- Hey, I got a coffee for you, too.
- Thanks.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.733
But then, as it became clear that
you were most likely gonna be late,

06:09.748 --> 06:12.672
I didn't want it to get cold,
so I drank it myself.

06:12.686 --> 06:13.963
I wasn't late.

06:13.976 --> 06:15.021
Who said you were late?

06:15.038 --> 06:16.320
You did, one second ago.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.892
Oh, no, I said you were
mostly likely gonna be late,

06:18.906 --> 06:21.202
but it turns out you weren't.
Who knew?

06:21.215 --> 06:23.402
Sounds like you need a little caffeine,
my friend.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.813
What say you and I go over to
the diner across the street

06:25.828 --> 06:27.982
and pick us up a
nice cup of coffee?

06:27.997 --> 06:29.600
Forget it. I'm fine.

06:29.808 --> 06:31.231
What diner across the street?

06:31.245 --> 06:33.403
This place --
Kirk's. Great place.

06:33.418 --> 06:35.862
The owner's a real character.
And the coffee's fantastic.

06:35.876 --> 06:37.230
Come on, let me get you a cup,

06:37.248 --> 06:41.260
though maybe you ought to pay, seeing
as I did pick us up the last round.

06:42.005 --> 06:45.112
Eggs sunny side up
with a side of bacon.

06:45.127 --> 06:48.451
And who's got the
scrambled with hashbrowns?

06:48.465 --> 06:49.862
Here we go.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.711
What the hell is going on here?

06:51.726 --> 06:53.500
Welcome to Kirk's.
I'll be right with you.

06:53.515 --> 06:54.662
What is this?

06:54.678 --> 06:55.773
It's a diner, Luke.

06:55.785 --> 06:57.071
A diner called Kirk's?

06:57.085 --> 06:58.733
It's the name my
mother gave me.

06:58.748 --> 07:00.160
Top you off there, Jake?

07:00.176 --> 07:01.551
Why  are you doing this?

07:01.566 --> 07:03.432
I just saw a need,
and I filled it.

07:03.446 --> 07:06.680
Seemed to me Stars Hollow was in
want of a real neighborhood joint,

07:06.695 --> 07:09.012
a watering hole where the
townsfolk could mingle,

07:09.027 --> 07:13.092
a  place where a fella could come and
get a piece of pie, a cup of arbuckles',

07:13.107 --> 07:15.151
and a soupcon of
small-town charm.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.451
Yeah, well,
Stars Hollow has already got that place.

07:17.465 --> 07:18.963
It's right across the street.

07:18.977 --> 07:20.973
It's called Luke's.
Luke's. Ring any bells?

07:20.987 --> 07:22.522
Sounds a little like Kirk's,
doesn't it?

07:22.556 --> 07:24.740
Luke, if you are suggesting that
you were the very first person

07:24.778 --> 07:27.192
to ever think of naming a
restaurant after yourself,

07:27.206 --> 07:30.052
I think that Denny Arby,
and Tony Roma

07:30.068 --> 07:31.551
might have something
to say about that,

07:31.588 --> 07:33.840
not to mention Mr.
Chuck E. Cheese.

07:33.855 --> 07:35.673
Chuck E. Cheese... Chuck E.
Cheese is not a person.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.193
Luke, do you think a giant mouse opened
a national restaurant franchise by himself?

07:39.203 --> 07:42.481
Look at this -- french toast,
pancakes, buttermilk pancakes.

07:42.497 --> 07:43.923
You stole my menu.

07:43.939 --> 07:46.132
You did not invent
pancakes, Luke.

07:46.148 --> 07:47.760
Anyway, I heard Luke's
went out of business.

07:47.796 --> 07:50.233
Luke's did not go out of business.
Luke's is closed for repairs.

07:50.266 --> 07:51.443
And you want to know
why it's closed?

07:51.475 --> 07:55.631
Because some nincompoop yesterday
drove his car through my diner!

07:56.025 --> 07:58.511
Would you care to step
outside for a moment, Luke?

07:58.525 --> 08:00.720
Outside? Outside what?

08:05.088 --> 08:07.701
I think it would behoove you
not to use slanderous language

08:07.716 --> 08:10.281
like nincompoop in my
place of business, Luke,

08:10.296 --> 08:13.431
because, let me tell you, it is only
out of the kindness of my heart

08:13.446 --> 08:15.981
that I am not suing
the pants off of you.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.762
You're gonna sue me after
you crash a car into my diner

08:19.775 --> 08:22.032
and bust a giant
hole in my wall?

08:22.045 --> 08:23.642
For all you know,
I could have brain damage.

08:23.675 --> 08:25.181
Oh, I'm pretty sure you do.

08:25.198 --> 08:27.450
You know what, Kirk?
Go ahead. Sue me.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.090
Crash into my diner,
make me lose a week's business,

08:30.105 --> 08:33.010
make me pay for the repairs,
and then sue me for damages --

08:33.028 --> 08:35.041
for brain damages!
That sounds fair.

08:35.054 --> 08:37.650
Luke, calm down.
I get where you're coming from.

08:37.664 --> 08:39.573
I think we can work
something out.

08:42.664 --> 08:43.811
What is this?

08:43.826 --> 08:45.233
A job application.

08:45.246 --> 08:48.560
The way business is picking up,
I'm totally gonna need a fry guy.

08:48.857 --> 08:51.341
What, it sounded like your
finances were kind of tight.

08:51.355 --> 08:53.791
If you came expecting a handout,
you came to the wrong guy.

08:53.807 --> 08:56.373
I'm of the "teach a man
to fish" school, Luke.

09:01.096 --> 09:03.713
You do not throw trash on the
floor of a restaurant, Luke.

09:03.737 --> 09:05.103
Not cool.

09:05.727 --> 09:09.312
Okay, this is easy.
You put in your snow crab.

09:09.328 --> 09:13.000
You put in your avocado.
You put in your cucumber.

09:13.018 --> 09:15.112
You match it together.

09:15.125 --> 09:17.802
And then you just roll it up.

09:17.817 --> 09:21.871
Slice it up like this,
and voilà.

09:21.888 --> 09:23.762
Or whatever they say in Japan.

09:23.775 --> 09:25.723
- Arigato.
- Karate.

09:25.736 --> 09:29.320
Look, it's those little coin shapes,
just like in a japanese restaurant.

09:29.338 --> 09:31.002
Arigato karate, babe.

09:31.016 --> 09:32.850
Yep. Okay.

09:32.867 --> 09:34.783
I'm gonna make one
more California roll,

09:34.798 --> 09:36.981
and then we can make your
meat-loaf sushi as promised.

09:36.996 --> 09:39.472
Yay! Do you want to put
suntan lotion in there?

09:39.487 --> 09:42.861
Did you just say sun--
Oh! Of course.

09:42.877 --> 09:47.321
Because a California roll would
have some suntan lotion in it.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.420
You're such a pity laugher.
Mmm! Good!

09:49.435 --> 09:51.313
- Good?
- So good!

09:51.326 --> 09:54.460
It's the best non-meat-loaf
sushi I've ever had.

09:54.477 --> 09:56.680
Ooh! What about
fried-chicken sushi?

09:56.695 --> 09:58.802
With some slaw in it.
That would be so good.

09:58.818 --> 10:02.642
Or chinese-food sushi.
Or P.B.-and-J. sushi.

10:02.658 --> 10:04.062
Or, hey, dessert sushi.

10:04.077 --> 10:06.712
Oh, my god, that's genius.
That is why you are the chef.

10:06.727 --> 10:08.841
That and because you're
the one who can cook.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.340
So, um...

10:11.675 --> 10:13.760
Hey, um...

16:10:15.002 --> 10:17.025
So I-I told him.

10:17.978 --> 10:19.640
Told who what?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.113
- Telling him that?
- Yeah.

10:22.126 --> 10:24.480
Are you saying you told
Luke about Christopher?

10:24.498 --> 10:26.400
Yes. What did you think
I was talking about?

10:26.416 --> 10:27.741
I don't know.

10:27.758 --> 10:30.180
I'm hoping there's
something that I forgot,

10:30.197 --> 10:32.853
like  maybe you were debating
on whether or not to tell Kirk

10:32.868 --> 10:35.263
the difference between
antiperspirant and deodorant.

10:35.277 --> 10:36.900
You told Luke
about Christopher?

10:36.918 --> 10:37.671
Yes.

10:37.686 --> 10:39.612
I thought no matter what
you weren't going to.

10:39.628 --> 10:40.580
I wasn't.

10:40.595 --> 10:41.981
Oh, honey, why?

10:41.995 --> 10:44.981
Because Luke showed up
at my house this morning

10:44.997 --> 10:47.981
with the truck fully packed,
ready to elope.

10:47.996 --> 10:49.293
- Oh, god, he did?
- Yeah.

10:49.307 --> 10:52.443
And he wouldn't take no for an answer,
and so I had to tell him.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.103
That's the only way he
was gonna believe me

10:54.136 --> 10:57.242
because it had to be no.

10:57.258 --> 10:58.673
Did it have to be?

10:58.686 --> 11:01.392
I mean,
did the answer have to be no?

11:01.407 --> 11:04.721
No. I mean,
I guess I could be married right now

11:04.736 --> 11:06.641
to someone who doesn't
want to be married to me

11:06.655 --> 11:10.431
and who doesn't know that I slept with
someone two nights before we got married.

11:10.906 --> 11:13.442
Well, when you
put it that way...

11:14.318 --> 11:16.332
Must have been horrible.

11:16.747 --> 11:20.592
It was one of the most horrible
moments of my whole life.

11:20.608 --> 11:22.081
Are you okay?

11:22.096 --> 11:23.640
No.

11:24.736 --> 11:28.311
I mean, no, not at all.
I'm so very not fine,

11:28.327 --> 11:31.002
but what am I gonna do,
you know?

11:31.026 --> 11:33.062
I have to be fine.

11:33.076 --> 11:35.003
Oh, honey.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.943
Yeah.

11:42.516 --> 11:44.703
Hey, Zach.
So, the honeymoon's over.

11:44.718 --> 11:45.902
Is the honeymoon over?

11:45.917 --> 11:46.542
What?

11:46.557 --> 11:47.602
How was Mexico?

11:47.617 --> 11:48.853
Full of parasites.

11:48.867 --> 11:50.532
Oh, gee, that's no good.

11:50.547 --> 11:52.572
The whole trip was
a total fiasco.

11:52.585 --> 11:55.100
It was the Stones at
Altamont times a billion.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.120
But you and Lane were
so excited about it.

11:57.138 --> 11:59.173
From the way you talked,
I was worried you'd move there

11:59.207 --> 12:00.363
and start a mariachi band.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.821
Mexico sucks.
And we were psyched.

12:02.836 --> 12:04.243
That's part of why
it sucked so bad.

12:04.278 --> 12:06.460
I thought I found this
amazing deal online, right?

12:06.476 --> 12:08.842
Pedro's Paradise.
It all sounded good.

12:08.856 --> 12:13.151
The website said it had ocean views,
its own kitchen, and a jacuzzi.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.893
And nobody loves jacuzzis
more than me. Nobody.

12:15.908 --> 12:19.070
And then we get there,
and it turns out Pedro's Paradise

12:19.085 --> 12:22.261
is just this room in this dude
Pedro's crappy apartment.

12:22.276 --> 12:23.473
No. His apartment?

12:23.486 --> 12:28.302
23 miles from the ocean, with a view of
a billboard for mexican nasal spray.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.793
So the website lied.

12:29.805 --> 12:32.511
And the kitchen we were promised --
it smelled like rice-a-roni

12:32.527 --> 12:34.551
and was always full of
Pedro's jerky friends

12:34.568 --> 12:36.553
listening to the devil's music,
playing cards,

12:36.568 --> 12:39.291
and making snide remarks
about us in code.

12:39.308 --> 12:40.753
Pedro's friends talked in code?

12:40.767 --> 12:43.261
Well, spanish, technically.
Same difference.

12:43.276 --> 12:45.802
They knew I couldn't understand them.
Pedro was evil, man.

12:45.817 --> 12:46.741
Man.

12:46.756 --> 12:49.001
Anyway, on the second day,
I got some parasite,

12:49.015 --> 12:51.813
and I've been barfing Linda
Blair style ever since.

12:51.828 --> 12:53.763
I'm getting better,
but now it looks like Lane's got it.

12:53.798 --> 12:54.591
Oh no!

12:54.606 --> 12:56.011
I'm heading over to
Doose's right now

12:56.047 --> 12:58.273
to get some ginger
ale and saltines,

12:58.287 --> 13:00.733
which, by the way, was all we
ate in the way of mexican food.

13:00.745 --> 13:02.523
Oh,  I'm sorry your
trip was so sucky.

13:02.536 --> 13:04.503
Yeah, well, live and learn.

13:04.516 --> 13:06.902
Like, now I know not to
drink the water in Mexico,

13:06.915 --> 13:09.230
which, by the way,
somebody should really tell you.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.453
And I learned that I'm not
morally against murder.

13:11.467 --> 13:13.070
I just wish I had
the guts to do it.

13:13.085 --> 13:16.293
Well, I'm glad you didn't kill Pedro.
I mean, he's not worth it.

13:16.306 --> 13:17.922
Yeah, whatever.

13:20.875 --> 13:21.852
Hello.

13:21.866 --> 13:23.611
Hola, Rory.

13:32.006 --> 13:33.853
Hey, sicko.

13:33.867 --> 13:36.180
Oh, welcome home.

13:36.198 --> 13:38.893
I heard Pedro's Paradise
wasn't so paradisey.

13:38.907 --> 13:40.142
Mexico sucked.

13:40.157 --> 13:43.010
Oh. But guess who I heard it from --
your husband.

13:43.025 --> 13:44.510
Can we not squeal about that?

13:44.527 --> 13:46.051
I don't really want to squeal.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.742
But if you feel like squealing,
go ahead.

13:47.755 --> 13:50.092
Oh, I'm sorry.
Of course you don't feel like squealing.

13:50.105 --> 13:51.052
You're sick.

13:51.076 --> 13:53.152
I actually feel okay right now.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.262
My aversion to squealing is
more emotional than physical.

13:56.275 --> 13:58.163
I'm so sorry your honeymoon
was such a bummer.

13:58.175 --> 14:00.673
On, like, the fourth day,
Zach got so paranoid

14:00.686 --> 14:04.983
that Pedro and his friends were
talking lasciviously about me in code

14:04.996 --> 14:07.803
that he lunged at Pedro --
leapt at him from behind the door.

14:07.818 --> 14:10.742
Luckily, Zach was so weak from
parasites that he missed --

14:10.757 --> 14:12.492
just flopped to
the kitchen floor

14:12.507 --> 14:14.870
Like he was a pancake someone
threw across the room.

14:14.885 --> 14:16.410
People throw pancakes?

14:16.428 --> 14:19.353
I just stared at him lying
on the floor and thought,

14:19.368 --> 14:20.953
"I just married that man."

14:20.966 --> 14:23.022
And you didn't squeal for joy.

14:23.038 --> 14:23.873
Nope.

14:23.886 --> 14:24.961
I went into the other room

14:24.975 --> 14:28.533
and stared at Pedro's poster
of Spuds McKenzie hanging 20

14:28.547 --> 14:30.443
and ate my 20th
saltine of the day.

14:30.456 --> 14:31.992
The whole trip sounds
kind of rough.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.933
Oh, you have no idea.

14:33.945 --> 14:37.311
What I just told you are the
highlights compared to the real stuff.

14:37.325 --> 14:38.690
No. What?

14:38.707 --> 14:40.503
We can't talk here.
The walls have ears.

14:40.517 --> 14:41.512
And giant sombrero.

14:41.528 --> 14:43.112
And big mouth.
Let's go for a walk.

14:43.126 --> 14:44.990
No, you're not feeling right.
You should take care of yourself.

14:45.025 --> 14:47.552
I'm feeling all right
right now, actually.

14:47.566 --> 14:49.291
Besides, I have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow,

14:49.325 --> 14:51.173
and if I start to
barf in public,

14:51.187 --> 14:53.262
you could just pretend we
were partying too hard.

14:53.276 --> 14:54.841
Which would do
wonders for my rep.

14:54.855 --> 14:56.340
All right, Mrs. Van Gerbig,

14:56.358 --> 14:58.320
let's blow this popsicle stand.

14:59.098 --> 15:01.351
Okay. So tell me --

15:01.708 --> 15:03.362
what are we thinking
about here?

15:03.378 --> 15:06.230
Well, the basic idea is
to fix the giant hole.

15:06.246 --> 15:08.082
Yeah, but how?
'Cause I've been thinking about it.

15:08.118 --> 15:11.230
I got a couple ideas about
a sort of log-cabin thing.

15:11.245 --> 15:14.943
I think what might really be nice
is a giant stained-glass window.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.730
Yeah, I don't think so.

15:16.748 --> 15:18.133
Don't rule it out so quick.

15:18.145 --> 15:22.123
I can picture what you're picturing,
like with all scary religious pictures.

15:22.136 --> 15:24.401
It wouldn't have to be
a bloody crucifixion.

15:24.416 --> 15:27.940
It could just be an
image of a happy animal.

15:27.957 --> 15:30.083
I don't know,
a smiling penguin or...

15:30.098 --> 15:32.110
or perhaps a
peaceful-looking giraffe.

15:32.126 --> 15:34.553
You think I should put up
a stained-glass window

15:34.567 --> 15:37.540
of a peaceful-looking giraffe
on the side of my diner?

15:37.558 --> 15:40.000
I'm just spitballing.
Nothing's written in stone.

15:40.017 --> 15:41.041
Oh, well, that's good.

15:41.056 --> 15:42.641
How about diamond shapes?

15:42.658 --> 15:45.461
You know what, T.J.?
Why don't we just get to work?

15:48.355 --> 15:51.531
- You're in a bit of a mood.
- I'm not in a mood, damn it.

15:51.547 --> 15:54.163
Okay! I'm sorry
I said anything.

15:54.178 --> 15:55.730
I won't say anything else.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.952
You know what, T.J., forget it.
I'm sorry.

15:57.966 --> 16:00.230
I really appreciate the
help you're giving me.

16:00.247 --> 16:02.530
I know it was
last-minute. Okay?

16:02.545 --> 16:03.893
No problem, buddy.

16:03.905 --> 16:05.791
What are brother-in-laws for?

16:05.807 --> 16:07.503
Actually...

16:08.458 --> 16:11.200
I'm glad for an excuse
to be out of the house.

16:11.217 --> 16:13.763
Because being pregnant
makes Liz incredibly horny.

16:13.775 --> 16:15.300
- T.J.
- Yeah, Luke?

16:15.317 --> 16:17.571
Can we not talk about
my sister's sexuality?

16:17.585 --> 16:20.303
Oh, yeah. Well, sure.

16:20.318 --> 16:23.992
I guess it's something about all
those hormones racing around in there.

16:24.008 --> 16:26.233
You should totally knock
Lorelai up, though.

16:26.245 --> 16:27.291
T.J.

16:27.307 --> 16:28.942
What, I'm not talking
about your sister.

16:28.957 --> 16:31.391
I'm talking about your fiancée.

16:31.408 --> 16:35.443
I got a feeling pregnancy would
make Lorelai particularly randy.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.010
T.J.!

16:40.058 --> 16:43.240
Just think how cool it would be if
we raised our families together.

16:43.255 --> 16:45.003
You should get
started now, though.

16:45.016 --> 16:46.250
Right.

16:46.265 --> 16:47.851
So how many kids you guys want?

16:47.866 --> 16:49.592
You know what?
I think I'm gonna go get the primer.

16:49.627 --> 16:51.062
- Now?
- Yeah. I'm just...

16:51.075 --> 16:52.730
worried about the hardware
store's gonna run out.

16:52.766 --> 16:54.080
'Cause you know,
it is the primer season.

16:54.118 --> 16:55.933
- Good thinking.
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

17:01.356 --> 17:03.511
So, now I know.

17:03.525 --> 17:04.452
Know what?

17:04.465 --> 17:06.670
That it's bad. It's terrible.

17:07.517 --> 17:08.701
Sex.

17:08.718 --> 17:11.382
Oh. No. Sex was bad?

17:11.397 --> 17:13.721
You can drop the act, Rory.
It's okay.

17:13.736 --> 17:15.599
I've known the real deal
about Santa Claus for years.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.940
And now I know about sex.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.520
- Lane --
- You know what's funny?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.941
I really thought my mother
was being an insane prude

17:21.954 --> 17:23.692
when she said that sex
was horrible for women.

17:23.726 --> 17:25.721
But now I can see that,
in fact,

17:25.736 --> 17:28.172
my mother was the only
woman who wasn't willing

17:28.185 --> 17:32.593
to maintain this ridiculous,
pervasive, media-supported charade.

17:32.606 --> 17:35.740
What ridiculous, pervasive,
media-supported charade?

17:35.756 --> 17:36.921
That sex is normal.

17:36.936 --> 17:39.081
That sex is a
wonderful part of life.

17:39.097 --> 17:40.952
That sex is sexy.

17:40.967 --> 17:42.390
I  mean,
can we just not admit it?

17:42.405 --> 17:44.480
Sex is not sexy.
Sex is horrible.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.453
Sex doesn't have
to be horrible.

17:46.466 --> 17:50.522
In a way, I'm impressed with
the depth of the conspiracy.

17:50.536 --> 17:54.273
If you think about it, it says something
about the potential power of women

17:54.287 --> 17:56.150
that the entire
gender could collude

17:56.165 --> 17:58.910
in creating the
"sex is sexy" myth.

17:58.928 --> 18:00.912
So sex with Zach was bad?

18:00.925 --> 18:02.901
Unbelievably bad.

18:02.918 --> 18:04.451
Every time?

18:04.466 --> 18:07.010
Yeah, right. Every time.

18:07.315 --> 18:08.812
You only did it once.

18:08.825 --> 18:10.773
That's right, and I'm out.

18:10.786 --> 18:12.692
Well, the first
time can be weird.

18:12.706 --> 18:14.930
I mean, my first time definitely
had its weird aspects,

18:14.945 --> 18:17.170
but it gets better.
It gets good.

18:17.186 --> 18:20.432
Um, sorry.
I just don't believe you.

18:20.606 --> 18:24.351
Um... okay. You have to walk
me through what happened.

18:24.365 --> 18:27.152
I mean, not graphically,
but help me out here.

18:27.166 --> 18:30.501
Okay. So we decided that,
for our first time,

18:30.515 --> 18:32.393
since it was such a big
deal and everything,

18:32.407 --> 18:34.413
since we've been waiting
and waiting and --

18:34.425 --> 18:35.933
God, if I'd known what
it was going to be like,

18:35.966 --> 18:37.211
I would have gladly
kept waiting.

18:37.246 --> 18:40.981
But anyway, we decided to re-create
the scene in "From here to eternity."

18:40.997 --> 18:43.232
Wow. Ambitious.
Sex on the beach.

18:43.245 --> 18:45.551
Anyway, the whole
thing was a disaster.

18:45.565 --> 18:47.363
Because you know what
movies don't tell you?

18:47.378 --> 18:49.821
That sand is basically dirt.

18:49.836 --> 18:51.681
It was dirty. It was cold.

18:51.696 --> 18:52.770
My hands were shaking.

18:52.788 --> 18:55.961
I'm trying to remember stuff from
school about condoms and bananas.

18:55.978 --> 18:58.623
And then suddenly I realize,
we got crabs,

18:58.636 --> 19:00.791
live ones that are
scuttling all over us.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.172
And Zach starts freaking out because,
apparently, he's afraid of shellfish.

19:04.187 --> 19:06.593
And it's getting
colder and dirtier.

19:06.606 --> 19:09.820
And at some point,
this pervert with a snorkel mask

19:09.837 --> 19:12.091
appears out of nowhere.
And I'm thinking,

19:12.107 --> 19:14.940
"we took three buses from
Pedro's apartment for this."

19:14.957 --> 19:16.381
Oh, Lane.

19:16.397 --> 19:19.982
Yeah, just talking about it
makes me feel sick and queasy.

19:19.996 --> 19:22.402
Well, you are sick and queasy.
You have a parasite.

19:22.416 --> 19:23.401
But, okay.

19:23.415 --> 19:26.762
Once you feel better, you really should
try sex again indoors in a bed.

19:26.777 --> 19:29.061
I'm open to the idea
of a sexless marriage.

19:29.077 --> 19:32.102
I mean, it happens for some people,
eventually. Why wait?

19:32.115 --> 19:34.051
Try a bed first. Seriously.

19:34.068 --> 19:36.982
You would not believe what a comforter
can do in this kind of situation.

19:36.998 --> 19:39.933
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be in Asia right now?

19:39.947 --> 19:42.613
How come you're not traipsing
around Thailand with Logan?

19:42.628 --> 19:44.471
Um, Logan's job started.

19:44.486 --> 19:46.511
He's far, far away in London.

19:46.525 --> 19:48.140
You're lucky.

19:48.158 --> 19:49.892
Yeah.

20:04.945 --> 20:05.981
Sorry.

20:05.995 --> 20:08.473
Oh. Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

20:09.055 --> 20:10.680
Are you fine, really?

20:10.696 --> 20:13.171
Because, I mean,
you don't have to be fine.

20:13.225 --> 20:16.831
Because this is really
weird and really hard and...

20:16.848 --> 20:19.801
- I'm not exactly fine.
- You're not?

20:19.847 --> 20:21.001
Of course not.

20:21.016 --> 20:23.550
Well, that's too bad because I am.
I'm fine.

20:23.565 --> 20:25.391
Well... okay.

20:25.507 --> 20:27.731
You know, maybe you should
punch Christopher's lights out.

20:27.765 --> 20:29.693
- That seemed to do it for me.
- What?

20:29.706 --> 20:31.980
Oh, so your boyfriend
didn't tell you.

20:31.996 --> 20:33.491
You punched Christopher?

20:33.506 --> 20:35.612
You two need to work on
your communication skills.

20:35.628 --> 20:36.900
- Oh, stop it.
- What?

20:36.917 --> 20:38.370
Christopher is
not my boyfriend.

20:38.386 --> 20:39.513
I don't care if he is.

20:39.528 --> 20:42.032
I mean, you can date whoever
or whatever you want.

20:42.047 --> 20:43.811
I couldn't care less. I'm fine.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.931
Okay, fine.
Well, if you're so fine,

20:45.948 --> 20:49.541
the next time you get a hankering
to punch someone else, don't, okay?

20:49.557 --> 20:52.282
If you need to take your anger
out on someone, take it out on me.

20:52.295 --> 20:54.942
I'm the one you're mad at.
I'm the one who deserves it.

20:54.956 --> 20:57.083
Look, you're the one
who's still hung up here.

20:57.097 --> 20:58.661
I'm telling you, I'm over it.

20:58.677 --> 21:01.743
I mean, I guess it's just not as
big a deal to me as it is to you.

21:01.758 --> 21:03.620
Oh, it's not as big a deal?

21:03.638 --> 21:05.873
Yeah, so what? We're not getting
married. It's okay by me.

21:05.907 --> 21:08.700
I mean, you're the one who
proposed in the first place.

21:20.667 --> 21:21.912
It looks good.

21:21.927 --> 21:24.320
If you say so.
It's no Sistine chapel.

21:24.337 --> 21:25.371
Well, that's true.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.932
- It's no Taj Mahal.
- No, it is not the Taj Mahal.

21:27.947 --> 21:30.451
So, look,
the window guy's coming by tomorrow,

21:30.468 --> 21:33.013
and he and I are
gonna put it in, so...

21:33.025 --> 21:34.993
after this coat,
you're free to go, okay?

21:35.006 --> 21:37.241
And thanks for the help.
It really looks good.

21:37.256 --> 21:38.602
You sure you don't
want any of this?

21:38.635 --> 21:40.023
No, I'm sure.

21:40.035 --> 21:42.331
- You stop drinking beer?
- No.

21:42.357 --> 21:45.051
It makes you kind of bloated,
but to me, it's worth it.

21:45.066 --> 21:47.472
I'm psyched Kirk's
got a liquor license.

21:47.485 --> 21:49.262
How come you quit
drinking beer?

21:49.275 --> 21:50.850
Whoever said I quit
drinking beer?

21:50.865 --> 21:52.143
You know what I like?

21:52.157 --> 21:54.240
Drinking beer outside.

21:54.257 --> 21:55.642
I don't know,
maybe it's 'cause I grew up

21:55.678 --> 21:57.720
watching my dad drink
out behind the tool shed,

21:57.735 --> 22:00.101
and it's got this
romantic image for me.

22:00.116 --> 22:02.450
- But that's my thing.
- Your thing is drinking beer outside?

22:02.486 --> 22:04.261
Beer outside is the greatest.

22:04.275 --> 22:07.802
Oh, except for at ice-skating rinks,
of course.

22:07.816 --> 22:08.410
Of course.

22:08.426 --> 22:10.001
Yeah, there's
something about the way

22:10.016 --> 22:12.233
the zamboni exhaust
mixes with the beer

22:12.248 --> 22:14.721
that's really just
out of this world.

22:14.736 --> 22:18.493
Speaking of which, guess what I just
got -- tickets to the hockettes.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.432
You know the hockettes,
the ice-skating girls? They're amazing.

22:21.446 --> 22:25.141
They do everything the rockettes do,
only they do it with ice skates on.

22:25.157 --> 22:26.321
Oh, that's great, T.J.

22:26.336 --> 22:28.211
Guess how many tickets I got.

22:28.227 --> 22:29.423
Four.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.860
And who did I think might
like to go with me and Liz?

22:32.937 --> 22:35.651
President and Mrs.
Bush. Just kidding.

22:35.668 --> 22:38.153
- You and Lorelai.
- Oh, gee.

22:38.165 --> 22:41.512
I don't...
think we can make that.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.680
Come on! When's the last time
we all had a wild night out?

22:44.696 --> 22:47.051
Yeah, you know,
I think I'm doing something that week.

22:47.068 --> 22:49.071
Man, that sucks.
Wait, which week?

22:49.085 --> 22:50.833
Uh, the week of the rockettes.

22:50.847 --> 22:51.942
Which is which week?

22:51.956 --> 22:53.321
The week they're here.

22:53.336 --> 22:54.962
They're in town a whole month!

22:54.976 --> 22:56.910
And I'm fully willing
to switch my tickets

22:56.928 --> 22:58.903
for whichever night
is best for you guys.

22:58.917 --> 23:00.673
Yeah, I don't --
I don't think so.

23:00.685 --> 23:02.793
- Come on.
- I...

23:03.107 --> 23:06.700
Lorelai and I... broke up.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.812
- T.J., okay!
- It's okay, buddy.

23:11.828 --> 23:15.842
It's okay. Let it out.
There is no shame in experiencing pain.

23:15.855 --> 23:17.103
I'm having trouble breathing.

23:17.115 --> 23:21.460
You are coming over to dinner
tonight with me and Liz.

23:40.577 --> 23:42.941
Hello, honorable Rory-San.

23:42.956 --> 23:44.482
You've made Asia for me?

23:44.497 --> 23:47.470
Mm-hmm. Here's your kimono,
honorable Rory-San.

23:47.485 --> 23:49.182
Thank you.

23:49.197 --> 23:50.943
You made crazy Asia.

23:50.955 --> 23:54.352
Well, actually, believe it or not,
but this is an exact replica

23:54.366 --> 23:56.870
of Japan, China,

23:56.888 --> 23:59.000
Vietnam, Cambodia,

23:59.015 --> 24:00.892
Hong Kong, Korea,

24:00.908 --> 24:03.250
and any other Asian countries that might
have slipped my mind for the moment.

24:03.287 --> 24:05.533
This is exactly what you
would see in the other Asia.

24:05.548 --> 24:06.611
The one that's not
in our living room.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.230
Yeah, the old Asia.

24:08.248 --> 24:10.942
The first attempt, I like to call it
"The prototype".

24:10.958 --> 24:12.643
Asia's a lot smaller
than I thought,

24:12.657 --> 24:14.542
more intimate.
And more fragrant.

24:14.556 --> 24:17.773
Yes, well, miss Patty donated
a bottle of her opium perfume,

24:17.787 --> 24:19.480
- and I spritzed it around a little.
- A little.

24:19.518 --> 24:22.493
Well, little at first,
and then I tripped on my flip-flop

24:22.508 --> 24:23.361
and broke the bottle.

24:23.377 --> 24:26.203
Asia's so pretty.
I love all the lanterns and...

24:26.216 --> 24:28.122
Oh, the poster of Mao.
Very nice.

24:28.136 --> 24:31.193
And one of Sandra Oh. Because oddly,
you have a poster of Sandra Oh.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.443
Well, she's a goddess.

24:32.455 --> 24:34.743
And those aren't posters.
They're billboards.

24:34.755 --> 24:35.943
You've lost perspective.

24:35.956 --> 24:37.952
Ah. I see you feng
shuied the furniture.

24:37.966 --> 24:41.012
Because it was so unfeng shuied before.
It was ridiculous.

24:41.025 --> 24:42.872
Here --
to document our journey.

24:42.886 --> 24:43.890
Xie xie.

24:43.907 --> 24:44.850
Oh, god bless you.

24:44.866 --> 24:46.593
That's "thank you" in mandarin.

24:46.606 --> 24:48.963
I knew that. Just testing you.

24:48.977 --> 24:51.321
Perhaps I shall
outline our itinerary.

24:51.337 --> 24:52.893
Perhaps we shall.

24:52.955 --> 24:56.223
All right, well,
first stop is Japan,

24:56.235 --> 24:58.053
land of the rising sun,

24:58.065 --> 25:00.092
ruled by Hello Kitty,

25:00.106 --> 25:02.502
where we are gonna
make our own sushi.

25:02.518 --> 25:04.541
You, me, and raw fish?
Is that safe?

25:04.558 --> 25:06.881
Well, I took a lesson,
and if you're really nervous,

25:06.896 --> 25:08.433
then we can skip the fugu.

25:08.447 --> 25:12.262
After we're stuffed with sushi,
we will take an invisible rickshaw

25:12.276 --> 25:14.820
to the rice paddies, i.e.
your room,

25:14.837 --> 25:17.300
Where we will spend
hours origamiing.

25:17.315 --> 25:20.190
- Paper cranes!
- Yeah, and paper bulldozers

25:20.208 --> 25:22.671
and paper dump trucks and whatever
else your little heart desires.

25:22.706 --> 25:25.583
Then, we'll take a bullet
train straight back to Tokyo

25:25.597 --> 25:28.330
where we'll relax
with some tai chi

25:28.348 --> 25:32.483
in preparation for the
kabuki play I wrote.

25:32.495 --> 25:34.272
Tai chi's actually chinese.

25:34.288 --> 25:35.623
Duh. I know that.

25:35.638 --> 25:37.820
We're gonna teach
it to the japanese.

25:37.835 --> 25:39.970
- That's nice of us.
- We're very nice that way.

25:39.988 --> 25:42.402
All right. So, finally,
we will conclude our journey

25:42.418 --> 25:44.690
with some fortune cookies
and dessert sushi.

25:44.708 --> 25:47.050
Dessert sushi --
I do love Asia.

25:47.065 --> 25:51.040
And that will be followed
by an educational video,

25:51.057 --> 25:54.691
which includes, but is not limited to,
"Bridge on the river Kwai,"

25:54.708 --> 25:57.380
"The joy luck club," "Karate
kid," "Shanghai surprise,"

25:57.397 --> 25:59.461
The Bruce Lee classic
"Enter the dragon,"

25:59.476 --> 26:01.540
The Tom Selleck
classic "Mr. Baseball,"

26:01.557 --> 26:03.780
- and/or "Breakfast at Tiffany's."
- "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?

26:03.815 --> 26:07.631
Yeah, starring Mickey Rooney in his
tour-de-force racist performance

26:07.648 --> 26:09.603
as holly golightly's
japanese landlord.

26:09.615 --> 26:11.121
Oh, yeah, he's so bad.

26:11.135 --> 26:12.520
All right,
let's make some sushi.

26:12.537 --> 26:13.712
But I'm scared.

26:13.728 --> 26:17.101
Oh, I'll let you in on a secret.
The fish is really fried chicken.

26:17.626 --> 26:19.283
You are honestly
asserting that you like

26:19.296 --> 26:21.382
the "tootsie-roll marshmallow
twizzler" roll better

26:21.397 --> 26:24.111
than the "butterfinger junior
mint chocolate-chip jujube" roll?

26:24.127 --> 26:27.273
Call me crazy. But I just don't
think butterfingers go with jujubes.

26:27.287 --> 26:28.681
Crazy.

26:28.697 --> 26:31.180
The limitations of your
palate astound me.

26:31.198 --> 26:33.021
Hey, I liked the "oreo
red hot" sashimi.

26:33.038 --> 26:33.863
Me too.

26:33.878 --> 26:35.232
See, I'm not a hater.

26:35.246 --> 26:39.432
Did you notice how the red hots
acted as a dessert-sushi wasabi?

26:39.448 --> 26:41.472
I did,
which is something we should remember

26:41.488 --> 26:42.970
when we go to
mass-market these.

26:42.986 --> 26:45.320
I'm telling you, the invention of
dessert sushi is gonna make us

26:45.357 --> 26:46.880
- our first million.
- And our second.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.683
I'd like our third
to be go-go dancing.

26:48.698 --> 26:49.943
Sounds like a plan.

26:49.957 --> 26:51.931
You know,
I'm really not following this plot.

26:51.945 --> 26:54.412
Okay, um... in the last scene,

26:54.426 --> 26:57.461
there was a sign that said,
"No shirt, no shoes, no service."

26:57.475 --> 27:02.553
And this guy, shirtless guy,
is angry about that -- angry.

27:02.568 --> 27:05.880
And he's like, "no, I'm not gonna
wear a shirt! I hate shirts!"

27:05.895 --> 27:08.032
End that really pissed those
other guys off.

27:08.045 --> 27:11.871
Hey, you know what would be
amazing and really asian?

27:11.886 --> 27:13.642
Fried ice cream.

27:13.657 --> 27:15.693
Oh, cows must envy
your stomach.

27:15.707 --> 27:16.483
They do.

27:16.495 --> 27:17.791
I'm so full, I can't move.

27:17.808 --> 27:20.173
I feel like one of those cats
that's bred to have no legs.

27:20.187 --> 27:22.260
Don't get me wrong --
my stomach's ready to explode.

27:22.278 --> 27:24.600
This is not a physical hunger.
It's more of a spiritual hunger.

27:24.638 --> 27:25.962
- For fried ice cream.
- Yeah.

27:25.977 --> 27:28.600
It's an eastern-philosophy thing.
You wouldn't understand.

27:29.017 --> 27:32.971
So, how do you think one actually
goes about frying ice cream?

27:32.987 --> 27:34.952
Probably in a frying pan.

27:35.098 --> 27:37.980
Uh-oh. Bit of a situation here.

27:37.996 --> 27:38.793
What?

27:38.808 --> 27:41.280
We are out of ice cream.

27:41.746 --> 27:43.683
I'm a cat with no legs.

27:43.695 --> 27:45.833
We can't answer it.
We're out of the country.

27:45.845 --> 27:47.961
No ice cream. Unbelievable.

27:47.977 --> 27:50.881
One time I feel like cooking,
there's no ice cream to fry.

27:50.898 --> 27:53.130
Lor, hey, it's me.

27:53.148 --> 27:54.920
Just still trying to reach you.

27:54.938 --> 27:56.270
Sorry I missed
your call before.

27:56.287 --> 27:58.673
But I wasn't calling about that
whole "Luke hitting me" thing.

27:58.705 --> 28:02.133
I don't care about that.
I just want to talk to you.

28:02.165 --> 28:03.702
I want to talk to you
about the other night.

28:03.735 --> 28:05.421
I know you said it was
just a one-night thing,

28:05.458 --> 28:07.543
but I want to talk about it,

28:07.556 --> 28:09.901
and about you and me, so...

28:09.917 --> 28:12.731
call me so we can talk.

28:12.745 --> 28:15.391
Okay. Bye.

28:17.026 --> 28:18.452
So...

28:19.346 --> 28:21.222
You slept with dad.

28:22.418 --> 28:24.981
Yeah. I did.

28:25.005 --> 28:26.560
You slept with dad.

28:26.577 --> 28:28.970
Um, that's just...

28:29.258 --> 28:31.072
I can't believe
you slept with dad.

28:31.086 --> 28:34.041
Is that why you and Luke broke up,
because you slept with dad?

28:34.056 --> 28:36.203
No, honey. No, I...

28:36.215 --> 28:37.793
believe me, no.

28:37.926 --> 28:40.952
Um, Luke and I had
broken up before.

28:40.967 --> 28:43.171
For how long?
I mean, it couldn't have been long.

28:43.185 --> 28:47.062
Because you and Luke have only been
broken up for what, like three days.

28:47.487 --> 28:49.370
Yeah, it was that night.

28:49.387 --> 28:51.822
The night you and
Luke broke up. Wow.

28:51.835 --> 28:55.440
So you just rushed right over there
the minute you were free, huh?

28:55.457 --> 28:56.253
Rory.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.841
Sounds like you were
in quite a hurry.

28:57.858 --> 29:00.840
Did you put a dummy in the passenger
seat so you could use the car-pool Lane?

29:00.876 --> 29:01.473
Rory.

29:01.486 --> 29:04.160
What? You didn't think of it?
In too much of a rush, I guess.

29:04.175 --> 29:06.662
I hope you buckled your seat belt.
You're supposed to buckle your seat belt

29:06.696 --> 29:07.872
even if you're in a rush.

29:07.887 --> 29:09.060
Hey, Rory --

29:09.075 --> 29:11.691
No, don't "Rory" me.
You don't get to "Rory" me.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.420
You slept with dad.

29:13.438 --> 29:16.770
Yeah. I-I-I...I know.

29:17.227 --> 29:18.910
Are you and dad an item now?

29:18.928 --> 29:20.993
No, it was nothing.
I mean, it...

29:21.008 --> 29:22.772
it had nothing to do
with me and Luke.

29:22.785 --> 29:25.372
What happened between me
and your dad was nothing.

29:25.385 --> 29:26.253
It was nothing.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.892
Mom, you slept with dad.

29:27.905 --> 29:30.121
For the love of god,
will you stop saying that?

29:30.137 --> 29:32.330
No, I can't stop saying
it because it happened.

29:32.347 --> 29:33.962
And you're trying to
pretend like it didn't.

29:33.995 --> 29:36.351
I'm not perfect, okay?
People make mistakes.

29:36.366 --> 29:38.553
I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow dyed
her hair that dark brown.

29:38.565 --> 29:39.951
It was very unflattering.

29:39.968 --> 29:42.350
If she's not perfect,
how do you expect me to be?

29:42.366 --> 29:45.171
Yeah, because what you did is
equivalent to dying your hair.

29:45.185 --> 29:46.571
That's great.

29:46.746 --> 29:49.091
Things were finally
good between you two

29:49.108 --> 29:50.510
And between me and dad.

29:50.525 --> 29:53.541
Did you not care that things were
finally really good between me and dad?

29:53.556 --> 29:56.022
I mean, do you not want us to be close?
Did you mean to ruin that?

29:56.057 --> 29:57.830
No! God, no!

29:57.846 --> 29:59.890
I love that dad's been good

29:59.907 --> 30:02.771
and that things with you
and dad have been good.

30:02.786 --> 30:05.792
I...I was hurting.
I was heartbroken.

30:05.808 --> 30:07.760
And...it happened.

30:07.776 --> 30:09.163
I slept with your dad.

30:09.177 --> 30:11.383
It's over now,
and it was a mistake.

30:11.396 --> 30:13.483
I can't believe you
didn't tell me this.

30:13.496 --> 30:15.880
I mean, first of all,
you say you don't want to talk.

30:15.896 --> 30:18.240
So I figure you're going
through some hard emotional time

30:18.257 --> 30:20.052
and you need some space.
That's fine.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.833
But what you didn't tell me
is that you slept with dad.

30:22.846 --> 30:24.511
No, instead you're going around

30:24.528 --> 30:28.162
joking about, you know,
origami and marshmallow sushi,

30:28.178 --> 30:30.030
like I'm some idiot 5-year-old.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.260
Rory, I was gonna tell you.

30:32.275 --> 30:34.060
- I just wanted --
- You know what, mom?

30:34.076 --> 30:36.630
If you're heartbroken,
you rent "An affair to remember,"

30:36.646 --> 30:40.223
you have a good cry, and drown your
sorrows in a pint of ice cream.

30:40.236 --> 30:42.791
You get a hideously
unflattering breakup haircut.

30:42.806 --> 30:45.142
You don't sleep with dad.

30:53.257 --> 30:54.722
Honey, we're home.

30:54.736 --> 30:56.322
Hi.

30:58.885 --> 31:02.183
Keep your hands off me,
you sex maniac.

31:02.195 --> 31:05.031
Oh, big brother,
I'm so, so sorry.

31:05.045 --> 31:05.643
Aw, thanks.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.432
Come in, come in.
Make yourself at home.

31:07.447 --> 31:08.583
Dinner's still in the oven,

31:08.598 --> 31:12.023
so we have time to have
a cocktail here and talk.

31:12.035 --> 31:14.590
Cocktail hour.
Pretty swanky stuff, huh?

31:14.608 --> 31:16.081
- Very, yeah.
- Sit, sit.

31:16.098 --> 31:17.772
You should be the one
that's sitting, Liz.

31:17.778 --> 31:19.352
- I'm fine.
- She's fine.

31:19.365 --> 31:20.832
Plus, it's good for
her to move around.

31:20.865 --> 31:22.770
Keeps all those
hormones circulating

31:22.786 --> 31:25.573
so they don't settle in one place,
if you know what I mean.

31:25.588 --> 31:28.183
White russian. T.J.

31:28.196 --> 31:31.460
She's trying to liquor me up.
I can see where this is going.

31:31.475 --> 31:32.581
It better not.

31:32.596 --> 31:34.542
We're really into white
russians recently.

31:34.556 --> 31:36.011
- It's our thing.
- Yeah.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.322
Of course, mine's a virgin.

31:37.337 --> 31:39.222
Ironically.

31:39.236 --> 31:40.620
Just cream.

31:40.635 --> 31:42.273
So...

31:42.405 --> 31:43.991
I'm ready to talk.

31:44.006 --> 31:46.001
Oh, you know, it's really okay.

31:46.017 --> 31:48.820
I don't need to talk.
It's just nice to be here.

31:48.837 --> 31:50.082
So was it Anna?

31:50.097 --> 31:52.282
What? No. It wasn't Anna.

31:52.295 --> 31:54.721
- You sure?
- Look, it wasn't Anna, okay?

31:54.736 --> 31:57.571
Lorelai and I broke up,
and I'd really rather not talk about it,

31:57.585 --> 31:59.700
so... if you don't want to
talk about something else,

31:59.716 --> 32:02.651
let's just sit here and
drink our white russians.

32:04.516 --> 32:06.180
Lane?

32:07.215 --> 32:08.243
Lane?

32:08.257 --> 32:09.111
I'm in here.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.512
Is Zach or Brian here?

32:10.526 --> 32:11.593
No.

32:11.607 --> 32:15.112
Sorry I didn't call first. I don't
know the protocol for married friends.

32:15.126 --> 32:17.630
I just had to get
out of my house.

32:17.647 --> 32:19.042
If I were there for
one more second,

32:19.076 --> 32:21.251
I think I would have had
to karate-chop my mom.

32:21.267 --> 32:23.572
I swear,
just chopped her in half.

32:23.585 --> 32:25.271
I guess I...

32:25.288 --> 32:28.522
Lane, are you okay?
Did the doctor say you have a parasite?

32:28.535 --> 32:30.841
In a manner of speaking.

32:32.695 --> 32:34.643
I'm pregnant.

32:34.656 --> 32:36.523
- Shut up.
- I'm pregnant.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.122
- You're not.
- I am.

32:38.136 --> 32:39.090
- No.
- Yes.

32:39.105 --> 32:41.740
I went to the doctor and he told me.
I'm pregnant with a baby.

32:41.756 --> 32:43.232
- No.
- Yes.

32:43.247 --> 32:46.110
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

32:46.125 --> 32:48.790
Oh, my god. Wow.

32:48.925 --> 32:51.220
Wow. How did Zach take it?

32:51.236 --> 32:53.291
He didn't. I haven't told him yet.
I haven't told anyone.

32:53.328 --> 32:55.300
I just came back here
and sat here. Pregnant.

32:55.316 --> 32:56.852
- You're not.
- I am.

32:56.868 --> 32:58.032
- Really?
- Really.

32:58.046 --> 33:00.150
I guess the combination
of salt water

33:00.167 --> 33:02.713
and seaweed and discount
mexican condoms

33:02.727 --> 33:05.710
and terrible,
terrible sex leads to a baby.

33:05.725 --> 33:06.762
A baby.

33:06.778 --> 33:09.121
A baby. Sex sucks so bad.

33:09.136 --> 33:10.703
Sex sucks worse than I thought.

33:10.715 --> 33:13.821
You only did it one time, and --
wow, a baby.

33:13.837 --> 33:15.581
That's what you get,
folks, for making whoopee.

33:15.617 --> 33:16.831
You're going to be a mother.

33:16.848 --> 33:19.001
When the doctor told me,
I just started throwing up.

33:19.016 --> 33:20.471
Well, you had morning sickness.

33:20.487 --> 33:22.201
This was a different
kind of throwing up.

33:22.217 --> 33:24.191
This was the kind of
throwing up that you do

33:24.207 --> 33:26.323
when you have to do
something that you can't do.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.911
You're going to be
a great mother.

33:27.926 --> 33:29.702
Maybe someday, but not now.

33:29.718 --> 33:32.051
I have a picture in my
head of me as a mother.

33:32.067 --> 33:34.232
You know, I can imagine it,
and in that picture,

33:34.245 --> 33:36.461
I'm wearing a skirt and heels,
and my hair is up in a bun.

33:36.498 --> 33:40.400
And I'm pushing one of those really
fancy british baby carriages

33:40.415 --> 33:42.621
that are called silver
surfers or something.

33:42.635 --> 33:44.943
Very Madonna in her
british-mommy phase.

33:44.958 --> 33:47.491
When I'm a mom,
I'll be calm and wise

33:47.506 --> 33:49.532
and have my act together.

33:49.547 --> 33:52.231
I am not calm and not wise,

33:52.247 --> 33:54.252
and I really,
really don't have my act together.

33:54.265 --> 33:57.133
You don't have to wear heels
and push a pram to be a mother.

33:57.147 --> 33:58.441
A pram! See?

33:58.455 --> 34:00.062
I didn't even remember
the word pram.

34:00.075 --> 34:01.371
Mothers know the word pram.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.093
Mothers don't have to
know the word pram.

34:03.106 --> 34:04.492
Yes! Yes, they do!

34:04.508 --> 34:05.782
They have to know
all sorts of things.

34:05.815 --> 34:08.592
They have to know what to
do when your baby is crying

34:08.608 --> 34:10.143
and how to change a diaper

34:10.156 --> 34:13.222
And how to use your wrist to
test if the bottle is too hot.

34:13.235 --> 34:15.011
Why the wrist? I don't know.
I have no idea.

34:15.027 --> 34:17.322
I think because it's handy,
no pun intended,

34:17.337 --> 34:20.210
and it's sensitive.
Wrists are sensitive.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.791
It's just one false move,
one misstep,

34:22.806 --> 34:25.610
and I'll ruin it.
I'm still making mistakes, Rory.

34:25.626 --> 34:26.929
Example "a" -- I'm pregnant.

34:26.947 --> 34:29.293
I can't be making mistakes
when I'm a mother.

34:29.304 --> 34:31.733
I'm not the person I need to
be to be able to do this.

34:31.746 --> 34:33.449
I'm not perfect yet.
I'm so not perfect.

34:33.467 --> 34:35.139
You don't have to be perfect.

34:35.158 --> 34:37.703
I mean,
even Gwyneth Paltrow makes mistakes,

34:37.715 --> 34:39.181
like "Shallow Hal"

34:39.197 --> 34:41.072
and that other movie
that nobody saw

34:41.088 --> 34:42.672
where she played a stewardess.

34:42.688 --> 34:44.572
So who's perfect? Nobody.

34:44.585 --> 34:46.422
Not even mothers.

34:46.445 --> 34:48.012
Yeah.

34:49.107 --> 34:50.920
I'm scared.

34:50.935 --> 34:54.152
I know you are,
but you can do this.

34:54.168 --> 34:56.641
First of all, you are great.

34:56.655 --> 34:59.213
And second of all,
you have nine long months

34:59.228 --> 35:01.750
to study about
bottles and wrists.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.302
That's true.

35:03.318 --> 35:06.690
And, already,
you are way ahead of a lot of people

35:06.707 --> 35:08.893
as far as parenting skills go.
Like Britney.

35:08.905 --> 35:11.080
Britney Spears does not know
which end of a baby goes up.

35:11.118 --> 35:13.273
And Courtney Love?
She's no June Cleaver.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.660
Yeah, I bet I could be a better
mother than Courtney Love.

35:15.678 --> 35:18.101
My sock drawer could be a better
mother than Courtney Love.

35:18.115 --> 35:19.530
But, yes,
of course you would be.

35:19.547 --> 35:22.632
And Michael Jackson --
you know not to name a child "Blanket."

35:22.645 --> 35:23.622
I do know that.

35:23.637 --> 35:26.421
Do not name your baby
after an inanimate object.

35:26.438 --> 35:29.162
See? Way ahead of the pack.

35:29.177 --> 35:31.531
Yeah. Hey...

35:31.545 --> 35:36.542
I wonder if Blanket ever met
Tom and Katie's baby, Pillow.

35:36.555 --> 35:38.382
Yeah, that would be
a perfect playdate.

35:38.397 --> 35:41.572
Yeah, when it's nap time,
they would be totally set.

35:41.587 --> 35:44.720
And then they could invite
Gwyneth's Apple over afterward

35:44.736 --> 35:46.132
for a little snack.

35:46.258 --> 35:49.860
Banjo, Rachel Griffiths' baby,
could play for them.

35:49.875 --> 35:53.610
And then they could all jump
in Mia Farrow's Satchel

35:53.628 --> 35:56.390
and make fun of, uh...
what's his face?

35:56.407 --> 35:59.100
- Oh, Pilot Inspektor Lee.
- Yeah.

36:04.157 --> 36:06.300
Little more time, looks like.

36:06.318 --> 36:08.742
Can I set you up with another
white russian there, Luke?

36:08.757 --> 36:10.153
One was plenty, thank you.

36:10.167 --> 36:11.552
I can't believe it's not ready.

36:11.568 --> 36:13.403
I thought for sure
it'd be ready by now.

36:13.418 --> 36:15.191
I'm so sorry, Luke.
You must be starving.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.463
Don't worry about it.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.713
Maybe we should start with
a little first course.

36:18.728 --> 36:20.223
Let me see what I have in here.

36:20.235 --> 36:23.211
So what exactly are you making
that cooks for this long?

36:23.226 --> 36:24.731
Tuna loaf.

36:24.798 --> 36:25.790
Tuna loaf.

36:25.807 --> 36:27.450
That sounds amazing.

36:27.468 --> 36:29.773
Well, it's very
thoughtful of you.

36:29.786 --> 36:32.053
- Jello cups!
- Score.

36:32.066 --> 36:36.591
Well, anyway,
invention is the mother of necessity.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.620
Eat your jello course.

36:41.077 --> 36:44.562
So it's not surprising,
you know?

36:44.957 --> 36:45.882
What's not?

36:45.898 --> 36:49.230
You and Lorelai breaking up.
I mean, that's not much of a surprise.

36:49.246 --> 36:51.493
Yeah. I don't know.

36:51.505 --> 36:54.591
I mean, I love Lorelai,
but the two of you were...

36:54.607 --> 36:55.803
Were what?

36:55.817 --> 36:57.280
You were never in sync.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.830
I don't mean that in a bad way.

36:58.845 --> 37:00.813
What do you mean,
we were never in sync?

37:00.827 --> 37:04.371
Okay, for one thing,
you never really moved in together.

37:04.387 --> 37:05.990
You wanted to,
but you never did.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.062
You were in two
different places.

37:08.078 --> 37:09.783
Well, there was a
logistical thing.

37:09.796 --> 37:12.660
And then,
when you found out you had a daughter,

37:12.675 --> 37:14.080
you never told her.

37:14.097 --> 37:15.893
That's not normal, Luke.

37:15.905 --> 37:19.643
That's not how people in a
healthy relationship act.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.193
It's like that
space-time-continuum thing.

37:22.206 --> 37:24.572
You're on a plane over here,

37:24.585 --> 37:26.713
and she's on this
plane over there,

37:26.725 --> 37:31.191
and you were both never here
nor there at the same time.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.630
It's like string theory.

37:32.646 --> 37:34.462
String theory?
What do you know about string theory?

37:34.496 --> 37:36.373
Don't underestimate me, Luke.
I read.

37:36.385 --> 37:38.263
And I watch
"Battlestar Galactica."

37:38.278 --> 37:41.723
Look, Lorelai and I
just did not work out.

37:41.738 --> 37:43.750
You were on different planes.
It could have worked out

37:43.787 --> 37:47.311
if there was a wormhole between
your plane and her plane.

37:47.326 --> 37:49.201
We didn't need a wormhole.

37:49.215 --> 37:51.353
It was like that
movie with, um,

37:51.367 --> 37:52.790
Keanu Reeves and
Sandra Bullock.

37:52.806 --> 37:53.671
- Exactly!
- Yeah.

37:53.687 --> 37:55.621
Oh, yes! Exactly, exactly!

37:55.636 --> 37:57.522
You're living in
the same house, man,

37:57.536 --> 37:59.991
but you are a
couple years apart

38:00.006 --> 38:02.002
In the space-time continuum.

38:02.016 --> 38:03.612
What house? It was a bus.

38:03.627 --> 38:07.133
Oh! I thought you were
talking about "Speed."

38:07.746 --> 38:09.291
"Speed" applies, too.

38:09.307 --> 38:11.153
Lorelai and I didn't break up

38:11.165 --> 38:15.431
because we weren't on the same
place in a space-time continuum

38:15.445 --> 38:16.883
or because there
weren't any wormholes.

38:16.915 --> 38:19.653
We broke up because we
weren't right for each other.

38:19.668 --> 38:21.961
Okay, it wasn't space.
It wasn't time.

38:22.228 --> 38:25.052
It was us, okay?
We didn't belong together.

38:25.068 --> 38:26.882
We never really...

38:26.945 --> 38:29.033
belonged together.

38:29.737 --> 38:31.821
We wanted to, but...

38:31.835 --> 38:33.760
we never did.

38:33.906 --> 38:35.733
That's it.

38:40.646 --> 38:43.210
I am so excited.

38:49.705 --> 38:51.290
It's cold.

38:52.248 --> 38:55.343
The oven's cold.
The oven's broken.

38:55.358 --> 38:57.013
Oh, man, still?

38:57.028 --> 38:59.602
We forgot to fix the oven.

38:59.615 --> 39:02.023
Oh, Luke, I am so sorry.

39:02.035 --> 39:05.173
I really wanted to make
you a home-cooked meal.

39:05.187 --> 39:07.740
I'll go the store.
I'll get something to make for us.

39:07.758 --> 39:08.972
Oh, Luke.

39:08.987 --> 39:10.872
That's okay, really.
I don't mind.

39:11.007 --> 39:13.300
I'll get us some stuff and
make us a home-cooked meal.

39:13.315 --> 39:14.381
Your burners work?

39:14.398 --> 39:17.072
Yeah, they work.
Okay, good. Great.

39:17.085 --> 39:19.103
At least you'll have
a home-cooked meal.

39:19.115 --> 39:21.162
Okay, I'll be back in a bit.

39:35.517 --> 39:36.910
Hey.

39:37.887 --> 39:39.870
Well, I guess both of
us avoiding Doose's

39:39.887 --> 39:41.783
didn't work out that well, huh?

39:41.797 --> 39:43.463
Well, I wasn't
avoiding Doose's.

39:43.475 --> 39:46.332
Just the closest market
to Liz and T.J.'s house.

39:46.345 --> 39:48.413
Right. Because you're
not affected by this.

39:48.426 --> 39:49.810
You're not mad. I forgot.

39:49.828 --> 39:54.252
No, I...I was mad.
I was really mad.

39:54.268 --> 39:56.402
Yeah, I kind of figured.

39:57.637 --> 39:59.503
I know I was a jerk.

39:59.516 --> 40:01.670
I was just... mad.

40:01.685 --> 40:03.582
I was the jerk.
I was such a jerk.

40:03.598 --> 40:05.910
I'm not mad anymore. Well...

40:06.587 --> 40:08.820
That's not true, but...

40:08.836 --> 40:11.871
I won't be,
you know, eventually.

40:12.948 --> 40:14.660
Really.

40:14.676 --> 40:16.311
Yeah?

40:16.715 --> 40:18.290
Yeah.

40:19.605 --> 40:21.313
Okay.

40:24.025 --> 40:26.530
It's not your fault.
It's not my fault.

40:26.546 --> 40:29.013
It's just,
we're not right together, you know?

40:29.026 --> 40:30.540
You're you, I'm me.

40:30.558 --> 40:34.351
I just want to stop pretending
we're something else.

40:34.997 --> 40:37.071
You don't belong with me.

40:37.088 --> 40:40.080
You belong with someone like
Christopher, and I just...

40:40.326 --> 40:43.733
Let's just stop
fighting it, okay?

40:43.746 --> 40:45.573
And you go back to
being Lorelai Gilmore.

40:45.588 --> 40:49.001
And I'll go back to being the guy
in the diner who pours your coffee.

40:54.576 --> 40:56.741
My hand's getting cold.

40:56.805 --> 40:58.273
Okay.

40:58.365 --> 40:59.932
Okay.

41:53.338 --> 41:57.200
