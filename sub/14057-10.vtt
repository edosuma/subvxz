00:01.894 --> 00:03.977
You can't ask Summer to marry you
if you don't want to get married.

00:03.977 --> 00:05.439
I can't ask her and then take it back.

00:05.440 --> 00:08.211
He wants me to break off the engagement,
I'm going bridezilla on his ass.

00:08.212 --> 00:12.149
It just doesn't feel right getting married,
you know, without asking you father.

00:12.150 --> 00:13.775
I'm not like the other guys at this school.

00:13.776 --> 00:15.592
I don't play water polo,
and I really don't listen to you.

00:15.593 --> 00:19.177
What if he finds out we've turned his investment
into a whorehouse or if Kirsten finds out?

00:19.178 --> 00:20.447
Taylor, you got married!

00:20.446 --> 00:22.860
I am now Madame Taylor
Townsend de Momourant.

00:22.903 --> 00:25.947
And I just found out that Henri-Michel--
that's my French husband--

00:25.947 --> 00:27.390
he's coming to Newport.

00:38.855 --> 00:41.112
Well, thank you for meeting me,
but my break is almost over.

00:41.119 --> 00:43.193
Well, I couldn't wait.
I got you something.

00:43.195 --> 00:44.261
Really? What's the occasion?

00:44.268 --> 00:45.463
Valentine's Day.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.853
Which is three weeks away.

00:46.865 --> 00:49.202
Yes, but you know when you have
the perfect present for someone

00:49.207 --> 00:50.602
and you just can't wait to give it to them?

00:50.606 --> 00:51.612
Uh... sure.

00:51.615 --> 00:52.811
- That's what I have.
- Really?

00:52.815 --> 00:55.001
- Yes. - The perfect present?
- The perfect present. Okay, sit here.

00:55.005 --> 00:56.200
I'm excited.

00:56.466 --> 00:57.900
- Okay.
- All right.

00:58.605 --> 01:00.463
Okay, okay, okay...

01:02.246 --> 01:04.000
- It's, uh...
- It's a scrapbook!

01:04.287 --> 01:05.361
About me and you.

01:05.367 --> 01:08.391
So this is the letter that you had
to sign for the French lawyer.

01:08.408 --> 01:09.113
Right.

01:09.117 --> 01:11.790
That's the receipt for the George Foreman
grill that I gave you.

01:11.795 --> 01:13.493
Is that...
Is that a picture of me?

01:13.515 --> 01:16.470
Yeah, sometimes I take pictures of you with
my camera phone when you're not looking.

01:16.476 --> 01:19.243
That's a picture of you coming out
of the bathroom at the movies.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.902
Thers one of you finishing a hot dog.

01:20.907 --> 01:24.193
Okay... Wow, I had no idea
I was under surveillance.

01:24.228 --> 01:25.920
Oh, yeah, clocking your every move.

01:25.925 --> 01:29.323
That's great. That's just... Oh, look,
the hospital bracelets from Christmukkah.

01:29.326 --> 01:30.950
Oh, yeah, I saved them.

01:31.328 --> 01:33.640
Is that too much? It is.
It's too much.

01:33.675 --> 01:35.262
No, no, no, no. Not...

01:37.006 --> 01:38.200
What is it?

01:39.427 --> 01:42.023
New bookstore opened.
It looks like a good bookstore.

01:44.005 --> 01:45.663
All right, well, look,
I should get back to work.

01:45.667 --> 01:46.863
Oh, yeah, okay.

01:47.115 --> 01:49.870
But thank you.
This was really great.

01:49.916 --> 01:52.852
Good, I'm glad you liked it.
Bye. I'll call you later.

01:52.885 --> 01:53.880
Okay.

01:57.415 --> 01:59.011
A season for peaches

01:59.985 --> 02:02.232
Oh, no. No, this cannot be happening.

02:10.425 --> 02:12.671
Excuse me, uh... what is this book?

02:12.706 --> 02:14.753
A Season For Peaches.
It's the bestseller from France.

02:14.756 --> 02:16.953
- English translation came in today.
- Okay, what's it about?

02:16.957 --> 02:20.411
Kind of like, Bridges of Madison County
meets The Notebook meets...

02:21.335 --> 02:23.171
- porn.
- Oh, my God. Plot, please.

02:23.215 --> 02:27.191
Uh, this Frenchman seduces this young
American girl and then they get married.

02:27.236 --> 02:30.533
- I can't remember where.
- His family's chapel in Burgundy.

02:30.565 --> 02:33.441
- Oh, so you read it.
- No. I lived it.

02:36.205 --> 02:37.282
I'm Peaches.

{PUB}

03:11.508 --> 03:12.162
Here you go.

03:12.166 --> 03:15.050
Oh, trusty neck pillow.
What did Ryan do to you?

03:15.375 --> 03:17.073
So you're really going to Seattle?

03:17.416 --> 03:20.412
You don't want to marry a girl,
you've got to ask her father's permission, Ryan.

03:20.416 --> 03:21.511
It's the polite thing to do.

03:21.526 --> 03:24.752
Yeah, except you don't want to get married,
which you could still tell her, you know.

03:24.758 --> 03:25.950
Not a chance.

03:26.565 --> 03:30.663
So you guys are really gonna walk down the aisle
because neither of you is willing to back down.

03:30.666 --> 03:32.021
This is where Dr. Roberts comes in.

03:32.028 --> 03:35.052
He  rejects me, this whole game of chicken ends
and I don't have to be the bad guy.

03:35.057 --> 03:36.841
But are you positive
that he's gonna say "no"?

03:36.848 --> 03:38.931
I mean, I thought you guys bonded
before he left.

03:38.937 --> 03:42.160
There was some golf watching. There may have
even been some sandwich eating.

03:42.165 --> 03:47.060
But deep down inside, ,he still sees me as the skinny
16-year-old boy trying to seduce his daughter.

03:47.065 --> 03:48.262
I just need to remind him of that.

03:48.268 --> 03:52.320
- Brilliant plan. Good luck getting rejected.
- Fortunately, it's something I excel at.

03:52.326 --> 03:53.250
Taylor.

03:53.265 --> 03:55.931
Ryan, can I talk
to you for just a second?

03:55.965 --> 03:57.732
Yeah, sure. Is anything wrong?

03:57.767 --> 03:59.983
Oh, no. Well, nothing big.

04:00.468 --> 04:01.962
A teensy little thing.

04:01.996 --> 04:05.462
So Michiko Kakatani called it "a sexual epic,"
which I think is a real stretch.

04:05.465 --> 04:06.790
It's already been banned in Texas,

04:06.795 --> 04:08.573
so we don't have to worry
about people there reading it.

04:08.576 --> 04:12.311
I debated even telling you about this,
but you know my policy-- full disclosure.

04:12.315 --> 04:14.901
So, how are you? Okay?

04:19.297 --> 04:20.822
Your ex-husband wrote this about you.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.781
A novel, not a memoir.

04:22.818 --> 04:24.612
It's a big differce. Ask James Frey.

04:26.795 --> 04:29.641
It's just that things between us
have been so good lately,

04:29.678 --> 04:33.610
and I wouldn't want one silly,
erotic noveto change all that.

04:34.225 --> 04:35.672
So I'm gonna ask you a favor.

04:35.758 --> 04:37.400
Please don't read it.

04:40.946 --> 04:42.973
Look, I've never read
a romance novel before.

04:42.976 --> 04:44.880
- Shocker.
- And I'm not gonna start now.

04:44.898 --> 04:46.090
Thank you.

04:46.666 --> 04:50.310
I'm gonna put this away now and we will
never have to talk about it again.

04:50.735 --> 04:51.800
Until the movie comes out.

04:51.817 --> 04:54.411
Yeah, right. Like they could make
a movie about that.

04:54.618 --> 04:56.771
Maybe on DVD at the adult video store.

04:57.286 --> 04:58.283
Bye.

05:00.848 --> 05:03.122
Yes. Yes. No.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.582
What are the numbers on this guy?

05:05.625 --> 05:07.282
Uh, six feet, 190.

05:07.327 --> 05:08.631
18% body fat.

05:08.675 --> 05:09.931
Nope. No good.

05:09.978 --> 05:13.063
You know Mrs. Jacobson, she likes
her boys straight out of Muscle Beach.

05:13.068 --> 05:14.591
Okay, these two should do.

05:14.638 --> 05:17.672
Tell her she can have either at $2,500,
gratuity not included.

05:17.676 --> 05:20.153
And here comes Kirsten. Go on,
get out of here right now, thank you.

05:20.156 --> 05:22.101
- Hi, Kiki.
- Hello, Spencer.

05:22.645 --> 05:23.391
How's your dad?

05:23.398 --> 05:27.491
Good. Still in Dubai buying a fleet
of limos or... maybe they were camels,

05:28.005 --> 05:29.203
can't remember.

05:29.626 --> 05:30.620
See ya.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.451
What's he doing here?

05:38.457 --> 05:40.723
Oh, he was just helping me
move some furniture.

05:40.725 --> 05:41.831
Everything looks the same.

05:41.847 --> 05:44.390
Yeah, it looked terrible,
so I had him move it back.

05:45.835 --> 05:47.711
Would you like me to help
you return those calls?

05:47.717 --> 05:48.712
I got it.

05:49.588 --> 05:53.030
Ooh, better get this. Work, work, work.
Oh, and thanks for the coffee.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.381
Hello, Judie Cooper.

05:59.306 --> 06:00.302
Morning.

06:00.537 --> 06:01.530
Hey.

06:01.815 --> 06:03.193
What do you think of updos?

06:03.208 --> 06:04.263
Are  you reading Modern Bride?

06:04.268 --> 06:07.670
As we speak, Seth is on his way to Seattle
to ask my dad if he can marry me.

06:07.677 --> 06:09.612
So, here comes the bride, I guess.

06:09.966 --> 06:11.453
Summer, do you realize what you're doing?

06:11.465 --> 06:13.840
You're about to enter
into a doomed marriage.

06:13.876 --> 06:16.351
I don't know, Seth seems really committed.

06:16.386 --> 06:19.221
Look, I think I might marry him someday,
so maybe there's no point in waiting.

06:19.226 --> 06:22.420
So,  living with me and the story
of my divorce has taught you nothing.

06:22.436 --> 06:24.801
No offense, Taylor, but you married
some French dude you knew

06:24.807 --> 06:26.300
for, like, nine seconds.
This is a little different.

06:26.407 --> 06:30.352
Okay, I see I need to get more into your
wheel house if I'm gonna drive this home.

06:30.965 --> 06:32.163
What about Holly?

06:32.248 --> 06:34.043
- From high school?
- Yes, she got married last summer.

06:34.047 --> 06:37.070
Why don't you call her? She could give
you a preview of life as a wife.

06:37.073 --> 06:39.197
- Fine. Can we drop it?
- Fine.

06:41.457 --> 06:44.600
A Season For Peaches.
You know, I'm reading this. This is dirty.

06:44.975 --> 06:47.592
Excuse me, the girl just
has a healthy sex drive.

06:47.629 --> 06:48.592
Yeah, for a hooker.

06:48.598 --> 06:50.841
Would you just give me that?

06:51.907 --> 06:53.103
Thank you.

06:53.596 --> 06:55.611
She's just young and confused, okay?!

06:57.407 --> 06:58.850
Can I get you anything else?

06:59.866 --> 07:02.142
- No, I'm good.
- It's not a library, you know.

07:02.147 --> 07:03.973
Hey, Ryan. How are you today?

07:04.975 --> 07:06.462
Let's see what am I going to have.

07:06.466 --> 07:09.431
- Two shrimp tacos, Luis.
- Hola, Señor Cohen.

07:09.468 --> 07:10.913
Luis, how are you today?

07:11.716 --> 07:15.821
I tell you, ever since you started working
here, it's revolutionized my lunch hour.

07:17.746 --> 07:19.193
Kirsten's reading that.

07:19.718 --> 07:22.031
Let me tell you, there is one part...

07:22.067 --> 07:23.201
Page 47.

07:23.616 --> 07:24.761
Man, was that hot.

07:24.767 --> 07:25.601
And in public.

07:25.605 --> 07:27.343
I thought Peaches
was going to get arrested.

07:27.346 --> 07:28.792
- It's Taylor.
- Who's Taylor?

07:28.817 --> 07:30.402
Her, the book, Peaches.

07:31.438 --> 07:32.052
You know her?

07:32.056 --> 07:35.603
No, what are you talking about?
It's about a girl from California who...

07:36.115 --> 07:37.312
- Oh.
- Yeah.

07:38.277 --> 07:38.862
Wow.

07:38.868 --> 07:39.862
So, uh...

07:40.785 --> 07:42.770
- have you read it?
- No, and I'm not about to start.

07:42.778 --> 07:46.070
- Can I get you anything else?
- No. No, I'm good.

07:46.107 --> 07:47.752
- Maybe a glass of water.
- Great.

07:48.477 --> 07:50.550
I just don't see how
they fit in the voting boxes.

07:50.556 --> 07:53.242
Come on, these women sacrificed
their life so you can vote.

07:53.247 --> 07:55.883
Maybe they should've sacrificed
some cheeseburgers.

07:57.968 --> 07:59.161
I'm kidding.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.531
Just ask me some questions.

08:02.645 --> 08:04.172
What happened in 1848?

08:04.217 --> 08:05.673
The first women's rights convention.

08:05.675 --> 08:06.672
And...?

08:06.955 --> 08:10.463
Elizabeth Cady Stanton
read the Declaration of Sentiments,

08:10.497 --> 08:13.290
which proclaimed that men
and women were created equal.

08:13.775 --> 08:15.171
All right, that's good.

08:15.176 --> 08:18.062
That was awesome.
I'm gonna rock that test.

08:18.907 --> 08:20.682
That's thanks to you
for help in me study.

08:20.687 --> 08:22.331
All right, I'll see you in class.

08:24.916 --> 08:25.912
Wait.

08:27.155 --> 08:28.953
What are you doing tomorrow night?

08:30.416 --> 08:31.610
You asking me out?

08:32.457 --> 08:33.650
Are you saying yes?

08:34.345 --> 08:35.539
You go first.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.740
Okay. You're cordially invited
to hang out at my house.

08:39.176 --> 08:39.921
With me.

08:39.927 --> 08:41.260
Well, I accept your invitation.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.592
- Nice book, professor.
- Yeah, professor.

08:44.698 --> 08:47.341
Real funny, guys.
See you later.

08:48.485 --> 08:51.393
Man, that guy is like
the professor of dorkonomics.

08:51.426 --> 08:53.053
He should teach Dorkology 101.

08:53.098 --> 08:54.420
He's not even a dork.

08:54.425 --> 08:57.203
He doesn't surf
and he doesn't play water polo.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.060
Yeah, ergo, dorko.

09:01.118 --> 09:01.951
Do you like him?

09:01.956 --> 09:04.102
You shut up before I vomit on you.

09:04.146 --> 09:06.150
What's wrong with this chick's hair?

09:06.508 --> 09:07.501
Gruesome.

09:09.456 --> 09:12.002
Oh, my God, look how ripped my arms are.

09:12.046 --> 09:13.530
I'm so sorry I missed your wedding.

09:13.536 --> 09:14.452
Whatev-skis.

09:14.468 --> 09:16.801
You dropped off the radar
when you started dating Seth.

09:16.805 --> 09:17.801
Yeah.

09:18.436 --> 09:20.062
You know, Holly,
when you were engaged,

09:20.066 --> 09:21.852
were you totally sure
that you wanted to get married?

09:21.856 --> 09:25.662
Oh, my God, totally, bitch.
You are going to love being a wife.

09:25.698 --> 09:28.311
You work out in the morning,
meet the girls for lunch,

09:28.318 --> 09:29.771
and then we shop all day.

09:30.468 --> 09:32.230
So there's, like,
a whole crew of you guys?

09:32.238 --> 09:35.002
We call ourselves the Newpsie-weds.

09:35.348 --> 09:37.192
Can you even handle how cute that is?

09:37.565 --> 09:40.911
Well, you'd better, because
you're meeting us all at lunch tomorrow.

09:42.625 --> 09:43.620
Yeah.

09:44.526 --> 09:46.752
You know, it'd be nice to have
a bunch of friends again.

09:46.755 --> 09:48.780
Oh, my God, look what I just did.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.761
So cute, I want to barf.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.620
- "Hi, Mom."
- No. No.

09:54.655 --> 09:55.850
"Hi, Mom."

10:19.576 --> 10:20.582
Bad idea.

10:20.625 --> 10:23.480
The reading's over, but if you want
your book signed, the author's still here.

10:23.486 --> 10:24.452
I'm sorry, what?

10:24.455 --> 10:27.501
- You may have to wait in line.
- Ah, that won't be necessary.

10:28.058 --> 10:32.390
Now... who shall I make it out to?
A girlfriend, perhaps?

10:32.617 --> 10:33.810
What is her name?

10:35.417 --> 10:36.412
Taylor.

10:40.837 --> 10:41.831
{PUB}

10:42.826 --> 10:44.021
Ryan, you in there?

10:45.575 --> 10:49.332
You know, I called you at work last night
and, um, then at home,

10:49.368 --> 10:51.872
but I guess you must have been
really tired.

10:54.416 --> 10:56.242
- Oh, no...
- Hey.

10:58.368 --> 10:59.080
Did you read it?

10:59.086 --> 10:59.731
Yeah.

10:59.738 --> 11:00.962
- All of it?
- Uh-huh.

11:00.967 --> 11:02.221
Oh, God.

11:03.616 --> 11:04.642
But I thought you said you...

11:04.648 --> 11:08.343
Met your ex-husband last night.
He was at the bookstore doing a reading.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.413
Wait. You met Henri-Michel?
How did you know it was him?

11:11.416 --> 11:12.911
Dirty hair, scarf smells like brie.

11:12.915 --> 11:14.253
That's Henri-Michel.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.473
I  just can't believe this.
I mean, did you read every page, even...?

11:16.476 --> 11:18.251
Page 47, yeah.

11:18.287 --> 11:22.302
Okay, Ryan, even if I was that limber,
you know I would never do that in the Chunnel.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.353
I get that it's not true, and, uh,

11:25.227 --> 11:28.321
you know, I'm sorry that I read it
after I promised I wouldn't,

11:29.326 --> 11:31.022
but seeing the guy in the flesh...

11:31.768 --> 11:35.021
Okay, but where does this leave us because
you can't even really look me in the eyes,

11:35.028 --> 11:36.470
so that's not a great sign.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.492
I don't know, I...

11:40.347 --> 11:41.943
I got to shower and get to work.

11:53.458 --> 11:54.460
So you're liking it up here?

11:54.465 --> 11:56.093
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

11:56.125 --> 11:57.323
I love it.

11:58.258 --> 11:59.671
It's good to see you, Seth.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.570
Good, 'cause what I wanted to talk to you
about is actually kind of a big deal.

12:03.936 --> 12:05.051
I thought we're going to play golf.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.202
Um, I'm actually up here
for something else.

12:08.165 --> 12:10.243
Okay, step into my office.
What's on your mind?

12:10.246 --> 12:13.040
Oh, you know, just thinking
about marrying your daughter.

12:16.245 --> 12:17.343
You want to marry Summer?

12:17.346 --> 12:21.850
Marry, tie the knot, get hitched;
whatever the kids are calling it these days.

12:21.898 --> 12:23.251
Why on Earth would you want
to do such a thing?

12:23.256 --> 12:27.860
Well,  the median age of married couples
is getting increasingly higher,

12:27.907 --> 12:30.363
so Summer and I have decided
to buck the trend.

12:30.396 --> 12:33.383
When the world zigs,
we're gonna zag.

12:33.616 --> 12:34.810
That's your reason?

12:34.955 --> 12:37.193
I said the zig,
then the zag, so...

12:37.317 --> 12:39.411
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Well, let's back up.

12:39.768 --> 12:41.213
Do you love my daughter?

12:41.587 --> 12:43.803
Well, she's cool, right?

12:44.385 --> 12:46.751
And, uh, she's pretty easy on the eyes.

12:50.608 --> 12:51.742
She's pregnant, isn't she?

12:51.748 --> 12:55.281
No. Uh, we thought for a second,
but thank God,

12:55.287 --> 12:56.823
we dodged that bullet, so no.

12:58.508 --> 12:59.501
Yes.

13:00.475 --> 13:01.923
I'll be right there.

13:03.848 --> 13:04.712
I've got to go.

13:04.726 --> 13:07.490
There's a man who's been impaled by
what appears to be a unicorn,

13:07.497 --> 13:09.660
- but our conversation's going to continue.
- Unicorns...

13:09.677 --> 13:12.093
We'll talk about this
on my rounds tomorrow.

13:12.126 --> 13:14.073
So does this mean I have your blessing?

13:15.427 --> 13:16.621
They do exist.

13:24.288 --> 13:25.281
Henri?

13:28.056 --> 13:29.550
Too late, it's gone.

13:29.597 --> 13:30.480
Henri, it's me.

13:30.485 --> 13:32.910
Peaches, you have come.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.621
I see I'm in the doghouse.

13:39.626 --> 13:41.603
Henri, these places come with bathtubs.

13:41.646 --> 13:45.680
Bathing is for the bourgeois. Now, tell me,
Peaches, how have I offended you?

13:45.716 --> 13:47.861
It wasn't enough that you had
to write a book about me,

13:47.865 --> 13:49.571
you had to come to my hometown, too?

13:49.576 --> 13:51.200
You think I want to be here?

13:52.948 --> 13:55.772
This constant sunshine is so banal.

13:55.815 --> 13:59.762
Look at them down there,
so clean, so passionless.

13:59.796 --> 14:03.091
No, I am only here to promote my book.

14:03.138 --> 14:06.081
Good, because if you think for one second
that little trip of yours

14:06.096 --> 14:08.390
is going to send me
scurrying back to France...

14:09.426 --> 14:12.780
As they say in your country,
"That ship has sailed."

14:13.206 --> 14:16.911
I see, though, that I'm still have
the power to disturb you, yes?

14:16.957 --> 14:18.451
What? No, no, stop that!

14:18.835 --> 14:20.333
I just came here to tell you something.

14:20.338 --> 14:21.580
I'm with someone now.

14:21.587 --> 14:24.533
Ah, oui, I met him last night.
He seemed to roll with it as you say.

14:24.535 --> 14:26.333
Yeah, well, he didn't.

14:27.938 --> 14:30.283
And if I lose him 'cause of your stupid book...

14:31.218 --> 14:32.410
Oh, Peaches.

14:33.397 --> 14:36.660
Peaches, I cannot stand to see you sad.

14:36.695 --> 14:37.691
Oh...

14:38.577 --> 14:41.422
What if he really got to know me, hmm?

14:41.457 --> 14:46.993
He would see that I am not nearly as threatening
as the fireball of passion he knows from the page,

14:47.375 --> 14:52.121
and that I have no intention
of stealing back my Peaches,

14:53.288 --> 14:55.120
though they are looking ripe today.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.482
Hey, up here!

14:58.277 --> 15:03.171
So, okay, what are you saying there? You're saying that,
what, the three of us should go on a date?

15:03.918 --> 15:07.220
Peaches, I know I wronged you
by writing this book.

15:07.507 --> 15:11.122
Let me repay this debt
by mending the rift with you

15:11.538 --> 15:14.312
and your corn-fed farm boy, hmm?

15:14.888 --> 15:16.242
Now don't move.

15:18.706 --> 15:19.903
The light.

15:27.205 --> 15:29.393
I apologize about
the last guy, Mrs. Jacobson.

15:29.398 --> 15:32.392
This one will have
his back waxed, I promise.

15:36.928 --> 15:39.101
Two cases of toner will be fine. Thanks.

15:40.236 --> 15:42.842
- Copy machine's acting up again.
- It was working five minutes ago.

15:42.845 --> 15:44.293
That's what's so frustrating.

15:46.147 --> 15:47.591
Julie, we need to talk.

15:51.518 --> 15:56.112
Ever since Bullet's New Year's Eve party
when all of our clients wound up with those young guys...

15:56.115 --> 15:58.163
- How funny was that?
- ...you've been acting jumpy.

15:58.175 --> 15:59.371
Overworked?

15:59.638 --> 16:01.570
'Cause that's all it is.
I really love my job.

16:01.578 --> 16:02.770
I know you do.

16:03.355 --> 16:06.150
Which is why I don't want
to see you jeopardize it.

16:11.565 --> 16:12.762
I need to get that.

16:18.046 --> 16:19.691
New Match, Julie Cooper speaking.

16:20.948 --> 16:21.943
Hi. Yes.

16:22.977 --> 16:24.171
Yes, of course.

16:24.455 --> 16:27.021
Okay, uh-huh. I'll see you. Bye.

16:28.186 --> 16:31.132
That was my lunch date.
I'm sorry. We'll have to talk later.

16:31.688 --> 16:32.883
I'll see you, okay?

16:42.027 --> 16:42.950
Okay.

16:42.957 --> 16:44.153
Ready, Pancakes?

16:46.978 --> 16:48.820
Summer, you came!

16:48.858 --> 16:51.071
Hi. I hope I'm wearing the right clothes.

16:51.586 --> 16:52.780
You're not.

16:54.016 --> 16:55.372
You are way too cute.

16:55.375 --> 16:58.071
Hold  on right here
and I'll introduce you to the girls.

16:58.126 --> 17:01.411
Hos, this is Summer Roberts.
She just got engaged.

17:01.446 --> 17:02.642
- Oh!
- Oh!

17:03.715 --> 17:05.143
Nice to meet you, too.

17:05.146 --> 17:07.392
Summer, this is Bryn and this is Liza.

17:07.507 --> 17:09.579
- Oh, you're just in time for a toast.
- Oh.

17:10.736 --> 17:14.191
To the newest Newpsie-wed,
Summer Roberts.

17:14.224 --> 17:16.012
Oh, thanks.

17:16.224 --> 17:17.423
Bottoms up.

17:19.896 --> 17:21.342
Hey, listen to this part.

17:21.646 --> 17:25.271
I hoisted her onto the stack
of hay and manfully...

17:25.305 --> 17:27.002
Listen, buddy, there's a lot of...

17:32.408 --> 17:34.153
Come on, Taylor, you can do this.

17:34.188 --> 17:35.970
He likes you, you like him,

17:36.655 --> 17:39.052
he doesn't think you're
a big fat divorcée whore.

17:39.116 --> 17:40.032
Hi.

17:40.038 --> 17:44.280
Hi. I was just trying to decide
between a burrito or a taco.

17:44.325 --> 17:45.551
Taco, burrito, big decision.

17:45.555 --> 17:47.370
So you weren't trying to psych yourself up
to come talk to me?

17:47.378 --> 17:49.143
No, of course not. Yeah, kind of.

17:49.955 --> 17:52.251
Taylor, look, it's, it's fine. I'll get over it.

17:52.258 --> 17:54.252
- Really?
- Yeah, just give me some time.

17:54.345 --> 17:57.893
Okay, well, there's something that might
help speed the healing process.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.411
- Cheers, ladies.
- Seriously, though,

18:00.415 --> 18:02.752
I am so using the champagne fountain.

18:02.796 --> 18:04.832
And what about your colors?
Have you decided?

18:04.836 --> 18:07.870
No, 'cause that's what we're gonna
be doing at my house tomorrow night.

18:07.876 --> 18:09.712
Am I right, bitches?

18:10.537 --> 18:13.152
But, seriously,
they feel just like real boobs.

18:13.187 --> 18:14.252
Let's cheers to that.

18:14.258 --> 18:15.250
Ah!

18:16.076 --> 18:18.471
Let's go to the bathroom
and I totally show you.

18:19.217 --> 18:21.410
You know what?
I am so down for that juice fast.

18:21.415 --> 18:23.591
- Oh, yeah, it's great.
- I told Brent that for Christmas,

18:23.598 --> 18:25.632
all I want is an African baby.

18:26.645 --> 18:27.681
African babies.

18:27.687 --> 18:28.881
I love them.

18:31.456 --> 18:33.752
Where's the waiter?
I need me some more champy.

18:34.107 --> 18:36.263
Hey, mama needs some more bubbly.

18:36.966 --> 18:38.410
How can I help you, ma'am?

18:39.017 --> 18:40.010
Jay?

18:41.915 --> 18:43.360
Did you need something?

18:44.776 --> 18:47.322
She wants some more champs, yo.
Hup, hup.

18:49.268 --> 18:50.362
- Summer,
- Huh?

18:50.377 --> 18:51.371
you okay?

18:52.005 --> 18:53.552
Yeah, just bring on the bubbly.

18:59.818 --> 19:03.140
And the best part, these cops,
they really are that stupid.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.731
You really want to watch this?

19:05.737 --> 19:08.413
Are you kidding?
It's my favorite show.

19:08.458 --> 19:09.942
You can't make this stuff up.

19:10.785 --> 19:12.942
Kaitlin, have you seen my cell?

19:13.815 --> 19:15.813
Oh, I didn't know you had a friend over.

19:15.847 --> 19:18.741
Mom, Will.
Will, this is my mother.

19:18.775 --> 19:20.140
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cooper.

19:20.148 --> 19:21.590
Nice to meet you, Will.

19:22.425 --> 19:26.443
Well, I wish I could stay and talk some more
but I'm gonna go look for my phone at the office.

19:26.456 --> 19:27.870
You two look cute together.

19:27.877 --> 19:28.551
Mom...

19:28.557 --> 19:30.113
- Enjoy your date.
- It's not a date.

19:30.126 --> 19:31.120
Have fun.

19:34.045 --> 19:35.583
Why did you say it wasn't a date?

19:35.586 --> 19:37.593
It's not like dinner and a movie or anything.

19:37.595 --> 19:41.633
Well, we just had dinner, and after this
crappy show goes off, we can watch a movie.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.952
Well, you got me there.

19:42.957 --> 19:46.603
So, if this is how you act with your mom,
how are you gonna act at school?

19:47.865 --> 19:49.220
Let's just watch this show.

19:49.237 --> 19:51.521
That cop, he just drove
a car into a meth lab.

19:51.855 --> 19:53.052
That's hilarious.

19:53.615 --> 19:55.262
I didn't think it was that funny.

19:55.347 --> 19:57.701
Well, maybe it's 'cause you're not high.

19:58.045 --> 19:59.493
Do you want to smoke up?

20:01.787 --> 20:03.231
I think I'm gonna go.

20:06.077 --> 20:08.313
I thought the way you are
at school was all just an act.

20:08.326 --> 20:09.773
What are you saying?

20:10.437 --> 20:11.631
Guess I was wrong.

20:21.597 --> 20:26.811
And the lady publishes an inane article
accusing me of being a post-structuralist.

20:26.855 --> 20:29.920
Oh! Talk about the pot calling
the kettle black. Am I right?

20:31.795 --> 20:34.061
So, what are, what are
your plans in Newport?

20:34.108 --> 20:38.473
Well, I have been searching
for even a nibble of culture,

20:38.517 --> 20:39.963
but I think I must give up.

20:40.288 --> 20:42.563
I only have one more commitment
before I leave.

20:42.568 --> 20:46.972
Tomorrow, I appear
on your favorite show, Je Pense.

20:47.007 --> 20:49.482
Wait. Je Pense is coming to Newport?

20:50.297 --> 20:52.022
What is Je Pense?

20:52.828 --> 20:56.512
It's this literary talk show.
It's kind of like a French Charlie Rose,

20:56.556 --> 20:58.000
but with less interrupting.

20:58.007 --> 21:02.303
They wish to do a field piece on the city
that gave birth to Peaches.

21:02.336 --> 21:03.980
They asked if you would appear...

21:03.995 --> 21:07.293
Oh, no, no, Henri, I said the last time
was my farewell appearance.

21:07.487 --> 21:09.941
The last time? You used
to go on a French talk show?

21:09.947 --> 21:11.543
Just a handful of times, though.

21:11.577 --> 21:15.552
My favorite had to be that one roundtable
we had Anais Nin's bisexuality.

21:15.647 --> 21:17.011
Things got heat-ed.

21:17.045 --> 21:21.232
Oh, that reminds me, my publisher want
to do a translation of Nin's erotic poetry.

21:21.775 --> 21:23.271
Of course, I recommended you.

21:24.175 --> 21:25.931
You... Me? Seriously?

21:25.978 --> 21:29.162
Of course. Don't you think Taylor
would be an inspired choice?

21:33.367 --> 21:34.811
I don't, I don't know...

21:35.907 --> 21:37.102
Nin's poetry.

21:40.056 --> 21:42.640
People say it's pornography.

21:43.186 --> 21:45.480
But it is really just deeply,

21:46.296 --> 21:47.491
deeply sexual.

21:47.917 --> 21:50.950
And Taylor understands
Nin like no other.

21:56.057 --> 21:58.831
What was that poem you translated
to amuse yourself?

22:01.397 --> 22:05.193
"And the day came
where the risk remained tight in the bud

22:05.237 --> 22:07.843
was more painful
than the risk it took to blossom."

22:19.107 --> 22:20.933
Well, I'm exhausted.

22:22.135 --> 22:24.692
Would you give Taylor a ride home?

22:25.107 --> 22:25.921
Great. Good night.

22:25.928 --> 22:26.923
Ryan?

22:28.446 --> 22:29.442
Ryan!

22:31.717 --> 22:32.712
Wait!

22:35.235 --> 22:35.973
Ryan, what's wrong?

22:35.978 --> 22:38.830
Nothing. It's just,
we've been in there four hours.

22:38.876 --> 22:40.582
First course, second course,
cheese course...

22:40.588 --> 22:42.950
And you couldn't stop imagining it, right?

22:42.996 --> 22:44.792
Me with him, page 47.

22:45.378 --> 22:47.770
Ryan, I thought you said
you were okay with this?

22:49.627 --> 22:50.820
I guess I'm not.

22:51.487 --> 22:53.361
- I'm sorry.
- Ryan...

22:54.136 --> 22:55.131
Ryan!

23:02.106 --> 23:02.143
{PUB}

23:02.147 --> 23:04.151
Hey, I'm gonna be in courtall day,

23:04.155 --> 23:06.543
so don't bother holding any
of those shrimp tacos for me.

23:06.548 --> 23:09.043
Tell me you are not reading
that book about Taylor.

23:10.536 --> 23:14.163
French philosophy at 7:00
in the morning. Okay, I'll bite.

23:14.557 --> 23:16.262
I read the book, Taylor's book.

23:16.305 --> 23:17.753
So you must be feeling...

23:18.308 --> 23:19.531
I'm not freaked out.

23:19.546 --> 23:20.701
Even page 47?

23:20.706 --> 23:23.550
No, no, I mean, I was, right?

23:23.586 --> 23:26.752
But then, uh, last night we,
uh, we went out with her ex.

23:27.498 --> 23:32.040
And you know, it was all art and philosophy
and how she used to go on that French talk show.

23:32.076 --> 23:35.012
And you know that part in the book where
she goes out to dinner with Jacques Chirac?

23:35.016 --> 23:35.852
That's actually true.

23:35.855 --> 23:40.061
Oh, so you're thinking "How can this kid
from Chino be hanging out with that crowd?"

23:40.108 --> 23:41.521
- Pretty much.
- Well, listen, I don't know anything

23:41.535 --> 23:45.031
about the world of French intellectuals,
but I do know Taylor Townsend,

23:45.346 --> 23:47.892
and seems to me, she thinks
you are pretty terrific.

23:49.436 --> 23:50.601
So just talk to her.

23:50.606 --> 23:53.110
Or you can sit here, reading your Sartre.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.310
- I'll talk to her.
- Good.

23:57.118 --> 23:59.063
Hey, you know who else the French love?

24:02.525 --> 24:03.723
Hey, lady!

24:04.386 --> 24:05.382
G'bye!

24:11.116 --> 24:13.062
Hey, babe, how
was your date last night?

24:13.248 --> 24:15.592
I already told you, it wasn't a date.

24:15.638 --> 24:18.292
Why not? Will seems nice and very cute.

24:18.778 --> 24:19.780
He is,

24:20.947 --> 24:22.182
he's a major dork.

24:24.397 --> 24:25.421
You like him.

24:25.427 --> 24:26.241
No, I don't.

24:26.246 --> 24:28.321
Oh, my God, you really, really like him.

24:28.355 --> 24:30.302
Oh, my God! No, I don't.

24:30.347 --> 24:32.043
- You think he's dorkalicious.
- Stop it.

24:32.047 --> 24:35.053
You want his big dorky arms wrapped around
you while he gives you big dorky kisses.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.502
Mom, I'm your child.

24:36.675 --> 24:37.673
Sorry.

24:38.606 --> 24:41.410
And even if I did like him,
which I don't,

24:41.455 --> 24:44.233
it doesn't matter 'cause I screwed up,

24:44.518 --> 24:46.490
- and he doesn't like me anyway.
- Whatever it is you did,

24:46.498 --> 24:47.943
I'm sure you'll fix it.

24:48.398 --> 24:50.142
At the very least, you have to try.

24:51.287 --> 24:52.730
What are you doing, anyway?

24:53.415 --> 24:54.771
My cell phone wasn't at the office.

24:54.786 --> 24:56.171
So you think it's in the frying pan?

24:56.185 --> 24:58.800
I've checked everywhere else,
and I just really need it, okay?

24:58.807 --> 24:59.801
Okay.

25:17.357 --> 25:19.120
Oh. Oh, hello,
I'm calling for Julie Cooper.

25:19.128 --> 25:21.720
I'm just confirming the details
of your date tonight.

25:22.217 --> 25:24.721
That's right, Four Seasons, room 321.

25:25.338 --> 25:27.810
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Jacobson.
8:00 isn't going to work.

25:27.815 --> 25:29.511
We're going to have to reschedule.

25:31.266 --> 25:32.463
Thank you.

25:38.166 --> 25:38.853
Taylor?

25:38.855 --> 25:40.181
You don't want to come in here, Ryan.

25:40.186 --> 25:42.202
I'm reenacting page 112.

25:42.238 --> 25:44.943
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

25:44.986 --> 25:48.882
I... I wasn't freaked out
about the sex, just so you know.

25:48.927 --> 25:50.121
It was the, uh,

25:50.605 --> 25:52.972
you know, all those people
you were talking about,

25:52.985 --> 25:55.323
the writers, the philosophers,
people I never even heard of.

25:55.327 --> 25:57.521
I just thought it was out of our league.

26:04.987 --> 26:09.133
I just, I didn't grow up going
to the opera or reading French poetry.

26:09.847 --> 26:12.093
Ryan, you're just
as smart as Henri-Michel,

26:12.127 --> 26:14.871
and I don't want you to be
anyone else than who you are.

26:16.978 --> 26:18.172
Thank you.

26:18.898 --> 26:20.393
God, I wish I hadn't said yes.

26:20.937 --> 26:22.431
What? What did you say yes to?

26:22.917 --> 26:26.273
I agreed to go on Je Pense tonight.

26:26.445 --> 26:27.851
You know, I can cancel it.

26:27.855 --> 26:29.343
No, no, look, I want you
to be who you are.

26:29.345 --> 26:31.051
In fact, I'd like to come.

26:33.878 --> 26:34.430
Okay.

26:34.437 --> 26:35.621
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.321
Now, I have a few minutes
before I have to get to work.

26:38.446 --> 26:39.943
And all that talk about page 112...

26:39.958 --> 26:41.250
Kaitlin's right downstairs.

26:41.257 --> 26:43.121
I know, but my impression
of the vicar's very quiet.

26:43.126 --> 26:45.770
- It's really, you won't even hear it.
- Don't, don't!

26:49.368 --> 26:51.312
So what was the deal with that unicorn?

26:51.815 --> 26:57.373
It seems the guy dressed his horse up
as a unicorn for his daughter's birthday,

26:58.478 --> 27:00.092
and things went terribly awry,

27:00.136 --> 27:02.513
but it taught us all about the value of family.

27:02.547 --> 27:03.961
And speaking of family,

27:03.968 --> 27:06.660
have you decided to bless
our sacred union?

27:07.027 --> 27:09.831
I've thought about your proposal,
Seth, and seriously,

27:11.527 --> 27:12.093
I can't.

27:12.096 --> 27:12.512
Oh...

27:12.517 --> 27:14.341
It's not because I dislike you, Seth,

27:14.347 --> 27:16.891
but I don't think that
you really appreciate Summer.

27:16.957 --> 27:18.152
- What?
- No.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.961
Look, Dr. Roberts, with all due respect,

27:23.007 --> 27:28.200
uh, you have a lot of grounds with which
to object to this admittedly harebrained idea,

27:28.237 --> 27:31.371
but if there's one thing
that is undeniable,

27:31.406 --> 27:32.801
it's that I appreciate your daughter.

27:32.805 --> 27:34.841
As you made very clear yesterday
when you called her

27:34.846 --> 27:37.262
"kind of cool and easy on the eyes."

27:38.727 --> 27:40.272
You got to do better than that.

27:40.278 --> 27:42.483
Well, she's hilarious, for one,

27:42.528 --> 27:44.700
and my favorite thing
in the world is to make her laugh

27:44.707 --> 27:48.492
because she has a crazy honk of a laugh
I think Nelson from The Simpsons...

27:48.527 --> 27:49.863
She does have a contagious laugh.

27:49.867 --> 27:52.532
Yeah, stop me before I say
that she makes me a better man,

27:52.535 --> 27:56.103
but she makes me more of a man.
Certainly less of a boy.

27:58.186 --> 28:01.320
I love every minute I spend
with your daughter, sir. I really do.

28:01.328 --> 28:02.770
So this wasn't some goof.

28:04.008 --> 28:06.752
You really want to spend
the rest of your life with her?

28:09.255 --> 28:11.570
I do, seriously.

28:18.828 --> 28:23.023
Then come talk to me after you finish college
and you got a chance at supporting her.

28:25.308 --> 28:26.502
Got to go.

28:27.365 --> 28:28.563
Have a safe flight.

28:33.487 --> 28:34.453
So Brent and I were, like,

28:34.457 --> 28:37.752
we don't want to kill any endangered owls
that live under our deck,

28:38.828 --> 28:40.452
but I really want a Jacuzzi.

28:41.058 --> 28:44.690
Oh, girl, you got to get
your hot tub, right, huh?

28:45.348 --> 28:46.340
Owls...

28:50.468 --> 28:52.613
What, are you supposed
to be, my conscience?

28:53.226 --> 28:55.813
Maybe, is this what you really want?

28:56.668 --> 28:57.860
Yes, it is.

28:58.377 --> 29:01.791
Uh-oh, someone's had too much champy.

29:01.828 --> 29:02.842
Summer's talking to herself.

29:02.846 --> 29:05.531
Well, I know exactly
what will snap her out of it.

29:08.195 --> 29:09.411
Oh, my God, your dress!

29:09.417 --> 29:10.413
I know.

29:10.577 --> 29:12.070
I thought you could try it on.

29:12.097 --> 29:14.443
I was really anorexic
when I wore it, not to brag.

29:14.446 --> 29:16.123
- Oh, good for you.
- Here.

29:16.167 --> 29:17.161
Thanks.

29:17.448 --> 29:19.090
You'd better not watch me change.

29:35.485 --> 29:36.043
Hi.

29:36.045 --> 29:37.643
So, you're the friend Mademoiselle Townsend?

29:37.645 --> 29:39.742
Uh, yes, yes.
What's happening?

29:39.787 --> 29:41.983
They started out talking
about The Season For Peaches,

29:41.987 --> 29:45.672
and now somehow, they are
into Existentialism of the 21st century,

29:45.705 --> 29:48.160
the responsibilit
of the post-colonial age,

29:48.208 --> 29:49.830
Johnny Depp. Amazing.

30:00.235 --> 30:02.231
I like it, and I think it looks good.

30:03.047 --> 30:05.140
Well, as far as presents go,
it's very beautiful.

30:05.158 --> 30:07.860
Look, Seth is asking my dad, okay?
This wedding is happening,

30:07.866 --> 30:09.983
so I need to make the best of it.

30:10.626 --> 30:12.672
Will you please stop trying to rescue me?

30:13.178 --> 30:15.992
The only person who can save you,
Summer, is you.

30:16.578 --> 30:17.571
Okay,

30:17.897 --> 30:20.283
A) you look ten times better than Holly;

30:20.318 --> 30:21.812
B) don't tell her that,

30:22.258 --> 30:26.051
and C) we have the most
rocked-out idea for your ringbearer.

30:26.098 --> 30:27.542
Who's my ringbearer?

30:29.397 --> 30:30.932
Cute little bunny.

30:31.927 --> 30:33.040
- Pancakes!
- Check it, Summer.

30:33.047 --> 30:38.890
We just realized that we can totally dye your bunny pink
so that he'll match the bridesmaid's dresses.

30:38.936 --> 30:41.631
Isn't that so adorable,
you just want to kill yourself?

30:41.847 --> 30:45.503
We're just gonna do a test run right now,
aren't we, Rumples?

30:45.547 --> 30:46.583
Yes, we are!

30:46.585 --> 30:47.582
Okay...

30:49.077 --> 30:50.073
Pancakes!

30:51.807 --> 30:53.251
His name is Pancakes.

30:54.276 --> 30:56.450
Bitch, what's wrong?

30:56.685 --> 30:57.881
Everything!

31:15.775 --> 31:16.973
Good night.

31:21.596 --> 31:22.792
You were amazing.

31:23.085 --> 31:24.282
Thank you.

31:24.288 --> 31:25.660
Okay, I'm gonna go say good-bye,
then I'll be right back.

31:25.668 --> 31:27.112
- Okay, all right.
- Okay.

31:27.805 --> 31:29.963
And Ryan, what did you think?

31:29.995 --> 31:32.843
I thought you guys were great,
not that I understood a word of it.

31:32.848 --> 31:34.821
We're going to celebrate
with some Pinot Noir,

31:34.828 --> 31:37.270
and I would love to pick
your brain on David Hume.

31:37.305 --> 31:38.873
Sounds great.
Who's David Hume?

31:39.197 --> 31:40.393
Good question.

31:40.436 --> 31:42.292
I'm sure you ask yourself this every day.

31:42.296 --> 31:45.371
Last night after you left,
Taylor told me of your studies,

31:45.417 --> 31:48.461
the series of articles you wrote
on the origins of skepticism.

31:51.168 --> 31:54.760
For the Vienna Journal? Maybe one day
they will be expounded into a book.

31:56.358 --> 31:58.112
After I heard about your research,

31:58.156 --> 32:01.321
traveling to Humes' personal
archives in Edinburgh,

32:01.248 --> 32:03.031
even I was impressed.

32:05.098 --> 32:06.291
I'm sure you were.

32:06.788 --> 32:07.420
{PUB}

32:07.437 --> 32:08.013
Yeah.

32:08.017 --> 32:09.312
Can I talk to you a second?

32:09.316 --> 32:10.743
Yeah. Excuse me.

32:11.587 --> 32:13.533
Thank you. I couldn't get out of there.

32:14.317 --> 32:16.410
Why did you tell him I was writing a book?

32:17.006 --> 32:18.002
What?

32:18.098 --> 32:21.452
You couldn't tell him the truth,
that I work in a Mexican restaurant?

32:21.458 --> 32:23.722
Okay, Ryan, what did you expect me to do?

32:23.767 --> 32:27.043
Because you said about three words
all night and then you just ran away.

32:27.045 --> 32:28.740
Henri asked me if you were on medication.

32:28.745 --> 32:30.093
Oh, so now you care about his opinion?

32:30.018 --> 32:33.961
Yes. Yes, I do. Because I could see him
sitting there judging you and I hated it.

32:33.967 --> 32:35.910
I just wanted him to know
how smart you were.

32:35.915 --> 32:38.861
And maybe it was the wrong thing to do,
but the story just kind of came spilling out of me.

32:38.866 --> 32:41.531
All right, okay, you lied to make me
look good-- I get that--

32:41.547 --> 32:44.390
but the thing is, I think part
of you wishes it were true.

32:45.287 --> 32:47.452
No, Ryan, please,
I just want you to be yourself.

32:47.455 --> 32:50.391
Taylor... I don't know, I...

32:50.967 --> 32:53.453
I think this is what we've known
from the beginning.

32:53.457 --> 32:55.450
- What? What's that?
- We're different.

32:56.516 --> 32:57.512
So what?

32:57.617 --> 33:00.971
Everyone's different. It's what makes
the world beautiful. Right?

33:02.637 --> 33:04.081
Okay, Ryan, I'm sorry.

33:04.345 --> 33:06.492
What do you want me
to do to make it better?

33:07.715 --> 33:09.163
I think I should go.

33:26.585 --> 33:27.780
Ms. Jacobson?

33:38.268 --> 33:39.262
Hello?

33:40.807 --> 33:41.800
Spencer.

33:42.416 --> 33:46.102
No, I didn't get any of your messages.
My cell phone's been MIA for two days now.

33:46.116 --> 33:47.560
I'm retracing my steps.

33:49.147 --> 33:51.840
What do you mean Mrs. Jacobson
got canceled on? What...

33:52.226 --> 33:53.421
what partner?

33:55.466 --> 33:56.660
Oh, my God.

33:59.306 --> 34:00.502
Good champagne.

34:01.387 --> 34:02.250
Sure you don't want any?

34:02.258 --> 34:03.753
Uh, no, thank you.

34:05.045 --> 34:06.043
Well...

34:06.838 --> 34:08.333
shall we get down to business?

34:08.886 --> 34:12.172
Uh, actually, Ken... I'm new at this.

34:12.216 --> 34:13.931
Could you walk me through it?

34:13.976 --> 34:15.792
Step 1 : you put the money
on night stand.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.253
Step two: we get nasty.

34:17.426 --> 34:19.022
Or nice, depending on your taste.

34:19.027 --> 34:21.141
I thought Julie told you all the rules.

34:22.476 --> 34:23.472
She did.

34:24.947 --> 34:26.143
I just thought...

34:30.697 --> 34:35.032
Would you excuse me?
I, uh... I left some toys in-in-in my car.

34:35.067 --> 34:36.262
I'll be right back.

34:40.315 --> 34:41.312
Toys?

34:43.388 --> 34:44.050
Sweet.

34:44.058 --> 34:45.702
Hey, man, that looks good on you.

34:46.516 --> 34:47.810
I like the red one.

34:48.806 --> 34:50.751
Trust me, that's a woman's coat.

34:58.206 --> 35:00.522
Hey. I just came to clear
a few things up.

35:01.137 --> 35:03.383
Um... I like you, okay?

35:04.648 --> 35:05.262
Okay.

35:05.266 --> 35:07.931
Maybe I messed things up
so you can't like me back.

35:09.286 --> 35:11.032
But I just wanted you to know that.

35:17.735 --> 35:20.241
- You don't.
- No, no, I do, it's just...

35:23.506 --> 35:25.202
Stupid winter clothing drive.

35:25.235 --> 35:28.301
You may not know this, but there are
homeless people that live in Newport.

35:28.308 --> 35:29.861
Really? Hmm.

35:30.485 --> 35:31.853
Hi, Darryl. Hi, Bill.

35:31.856 --> 35:33.352
- Hey, Kaitlin.
- Hey, Kaitlin.

35:37.338 --> 35:40.310
Hey, what you do say I give
you a call when I leave here?

35:40.457 --> 35:41.451
Okay.

35:41.648 --> 35:44.842
Just can't believe this winter clothing
drive is salting my game.

35:59.417 --> 36:00.682
Kirsten, I can explain.

36:00.688 --> 36:03.860
That you've been running a prostitution
ring through our business.

36:03.866 --> 36:04.860
It...

36:05.485 --> 36:06.890
it just... it just happened.

36:06.895 --> 36:08.890
There are dozens of names here.

36:08.925 --> 36:11.633
Hercules, Commander Snake...

36:11.676 --> 36:14.183
Kirsten, I am so sorry, but I promise...

36:14.217 --> 36:16.643
I have known you a long time, Julie.

36:16.676 --> 36:20.092
This isn't just a matter of cloudy
judgment and questionable morals.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.392
It's breaking federal law.

36:21.398 --> 36:22.590
I understand.

36:23.298 --> 36:25.610
I do. And I deeply, deeply regret it,

36:25.648 --> 36:29.282
but if we just quit now,
we can act like it never happened.

36:32.025 --> 36:33.222
I wish I could.

36:38.306 --> 36:39.952
I want you out of here by Monday.

36:41.075 --> 36:42.271
Kirsten, please.

36:42.305 --> 36:44.052
I'm going to do you one more favor.

36:44.638 --> 36:47.830
I'm not going to call the police
and I'm not going to tell Sandy.

36:48.597 --> 36:49.792
You're on your own.

36:58.727 --> 36:59.723
Hello?

36:59.965 --> 37:01.413
Caterpillar, it's me.

37:02.697 --> 37:04.140
You're calling me now?

37:04.807 --> 37:07.452
Look, I already sent them all home.
Isn't that enough?

37:08.667 --> 37:10.113
What are you talking about?

37:10.838 --> 37:12.072
Wait, where are you?

37:12.076 --> 37:13.163
I'm in my dorm room.

37:13.166 --> 37:15.690
Summer, I've been doing
some out-of-body work.

37:15.735 --> 37:19.923
I had a vision of you surrounded
by owls in a white dress,

37:19.968 --> 37:23.533
and Summer, the owls,
they were crying for you.

37:23.946 --> 37:26.703
God, I'm okay now.

37:28.476 --> 37:31.110
I just... kind of got engaged.

37:31.156 --> 37:32.352
That's amazing.

37:32.778 --> 37:34.370
I'll weave you guys something ASAP.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.313
Jay, I'm so confused.

37:37.386 --> 37:38.832
I don't know what I want.

37:39.468 --> 37:40.241
Summer,

37:40.246 --> 37:44.182
in order for two halves to be whole,
each half must be whole on its own.

37:45.247 --> 37:46.692
That is really true.

37:47.026 --> 37:48.541
I'm gonna sing you a song.

37:49.806 --> 37:52.712
Moon, stars are above you...

38:00.655 --> 38:02.831
Oh, man sitting by himself in the dark.

38:03.066 --> 38:04.512
It's not a good sign.

38:05.257 --> 38:06.022
Are you okay?

38:06.026 --> 38:07.220
I've been better.

38:08.077 --> 38:09.073
Yeah.

38:11.406 --> 38:13.753
I don't know what's going on
with me and Taylor.

38:14.545 --> 38:16.471
I think maybe we're just too different.

38:16.476 --> 38:18.272
You said that like it's a bad thing.

38:18.676 --> 38:19.951
Look at Kirsten and me.

38:19.955 --> 38:23.713
Right. Well, you know,
you guys have your own rhythm.

38:23.745 --> 38:26.363
Well, yeah, it took years
to figure that out.

38:26.956 --> 38:30.742
I love Kirsten dearly, and-and...
and still it gets complicated.

38:31.806 --> 38:33.002
So how do you know

38:33.908 --> 38:36.641
you know, whether you're good,
different or just...?

38:36.686 --> 38:37.682
From opposite planets?

38:37.698 --> 38:38.690
Right.

38:40.417 --> 38:41.861
At the end of the day,

38:42.446 --> 38:46.340
you either focus on what separates you
or you focus on what holds you together.

38:47.328 --> 38:48.523
And it's up to you.

39:09.927 --> 39:11.230
Hey, stranger.

39:11.267 --> 39:12.261
Hi.

39:13.278 --> 39:14.870
How was Seattle?

39:15.177 --> 39:16.670
It was good, good.

39:16.716 --> 39:17.612
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:17.627 --> 39:19.321
How was my dad when you asked him?

39:19.388 --> 39:20.853
Cold, warm, lukewarm?

39:23.028 --> 39:27.172
Well, he did not give us permission to get
married, at least for the next few years.

39:27.205 --> 39:28.543
Oh... damn.

39:28.576 --> 39:31.422
Yeah. Okay, well, uh,
here's, here's the deal.

39:37.888 --> 39:41.180
I went up there, knowing your dad would
say no and that I could get out of this,

39:41.185 --> 39:42.181
but

39:42.975 --> 39:45.721
I realized I don't want out.

39:47.346 --> 39:48.682
I want in with you.

39:49.298 --> 39:52.302
forever, you know?
So, I think we should stay engage.

39:52.725 --> 39:54.173
It doesn't have to be

39:54.778 --> 39:55.970
today, but...

39:57.506 --> 39:58.503
someday.

40:07.206 --> 40:08.202
Seth,

40:09.465 --> 40:11.760
I realized something, too,
while you were gone.

40:13.127 --> 40:16.632
It turns out I have no idea who I am.

40:16.666 --> 40:17.832
In the past few months,

40:17.838 --> 40:21.540
I went from being a hard-core environmentalist
to a Newpsie-wed in training.

40:21.555 --> 40:23.620
- You're a Newpsie?
- For 48 hours.

40:24.426 --> 40:29.723
The point is, I don't think that you can be
with someone until you can be with yourself.

40:32.336 --> 40:34.480
I think it's something
I need to figure out.

40:36.775 --> 40:38.882
Oh, that sounds like a...

40:39.295 --> 40:40.502
I guess it's a no.

40:41.308 --> 40:42.503
I'm sorry.

40:43.938 --> 40:44.930
Well, I think I'm gonna...

40:44.947 --> 40:46.791
I'm going to see you tomorrow, okay?

40:47.078 --> 40:48.072
Okay.

40:49.378 --> 40:50.373
Hey...

40:52.947 --> 40:54.391
you should take this...

40:56.645 --> 40:57.643
because

40:58.388 --> 40:59.831
we might need it someday.

41:48.368 --> 41:50.253
Please, don't be sad, Peaches.

41:55.308 --> 41:56.300
Ryan?

42:09.038 --> 42:10.230
Taylor, I'm...

42:26.368 --> 42:27.560
What is it?

42:29.716 --> 42:31.901
Nothing. It's just... thought...

42:34.247 --> 42:35.243
Nothing.

42:36.985 --> 42:39.483
You know, it's getting late,
Henri, so I should go.

42:39.486 --> 42:40.931
Stay a little longer...

42:42.076 --> 42:43.073
please?

42:46.775 --> 42:47.772
Okay.
