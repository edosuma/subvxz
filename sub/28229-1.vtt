walks away from the world of martial arts"

01:00.500 --> 01:02.866
after cheung tin chi was
defeated by ip man,

01:03.292 --> 01:05.328
he took his son cheung fung,

01:05.458 --> 01:07.574
and left the world of martial arts.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.083
I'm done.

01:41.792 --> 01:44.078
I have another job in 2 days for you.

01:44.708 --> 01:46.039
Target's a hoodlum.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.240
Someone who's had enough

01:48.625 --> 01:49.990
wants to teach him a lesson.

01:50.375 --> 01:51.375
I'm out

01:53.583 --> 01:55.539
no children, no women

01:56.167 --> 01:57.327
and no nice guys.

01:57.417 --> 02:00.329
So this guy isn't against your rules.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.161
Look I'll double your pay.

02:03.167 --> 02:04.407
Think it over.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.827
I said I'm done.

02:07.708 --> 02:09.413
All you know is fighting.

02:09.417 --> 02:10.247
Walking away now?

02:10.250 --> 02:11.865
What a pity!

02:12.667 --> 02:14.578
I want a simple life.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.948
Nothing to pity about.

02:21.667 --> 02:22.827
Hold on!

02:25.958 --> 02:27.323
I have a question.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.164
So which is faster?

02:29.792 --> 02:31.202
Your fist or my gun?

02:33.750 --> 02:35.081
Over 7 paces,

02:35.375 --> 02:36.581
gun's faster.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.164
Within 7 paces,

02:40.333 --> 02:41.333
my fist.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.536
We're around 7 paces apart.

02:56.167 --> 02:57.407
Stop!

02:58.417 --> 02:59.372
People pay you.

02:59.417 --> 03:00.702
To solve their problems.

03:01.417 --> 03:03.749
Since even money can't change your mind.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.205
I'll respect your decision.

03:05.375 --> 03:06.375
Go!

03:07.500 --> 03:10.287
Lifting your jacket is
what slowed you down.

03:43.333 --> 03:44.333
Fung!

03:44.708 --> 03:45.708
Fung fung!

03:45.917 --> 03:47.578
Time to get up for school.

03:47.750 --> 03:49.286
Get up.

03:59.458 --> 04:00.538
What's for breakfast?

04:00.792 --> 04:03.625
Plain congee and breadsticks again?

04:03.792 --> 04:05.453
Can we eat something else?

04:06.083 --> 04:07.118
Okay.

04:07.292 --> 04:09.123
I'll get something else tomorrow.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.115
You say that every time.

04:13.417 --> 04:14.623
Liar!

04:29.667 --> 04:30.497
Tin chi!

04:30.583 --> 04:31.618
Morning, auntie luk!

04:32.833 --> 04:33.663
Papal!

04:33.667 --> 04:35.032
Today's a big day.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.703
You have to get off work on time.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.160
Boss,

04:38.167 --> 04:39.828
I just started working.

04:39.833 --> 04:41.073
You want me to get off already?

04:42.125 --> 04:43.285
Don't be lazy.

04:43.333 --> 04:43.867
Okay!

04:43.875 --> 04:45.581
Let's check the delivery list.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.619
Soy sauce, 10 bottles...

04:47.833 --> 04:49.824
Chilli sauce, 6 bottles...

04:50.208 --> 04:51.493
Peanuts, 5 packs.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.500
Give me hand.

04:57.917 --> 04:58.781
Auntie luk

04:58.792 --> 05:00.828
could you watch my store
while I make a delivery

05:00.833 --> 05:02.198

05:02.208 --> 05:03.208
thank you!

05:05.625 --> 05:06.990
Auntie luk I'm going to school!

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Good boy!

05:13.833 --> 05:14.663
Hey!

05:14.667 --> 05:15.667
Hey! Cheung fung

05:16.042 --> 05:17.202
there you go.

05:18.667 --> 05:19.656
Papal!

05:19.667 --> 05:21.282
Remember we have plans tonight.

05:21.292 --> 05:23.123
So be on time okay?

05:23.125 --> 05:25.036
You're the one who needs to
remember to be on time.

05:25.042 --> 05:26.623
Don't get detention.

05:26.625 --> 05:27.239
You hear me?

05:27.250 --> 05:28.250
Don't worry!

05:30.417 --> 05:31.532
The bus is here!

05:35.542 --> 05:36.952
Be careful.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.289
I will! Bye!

05:40.875 --> 05:42.035
Bye!

05:59.625 --> 06:00.625
You...

06:07.583 --> 06:08.789
Hey Nana!

06:10.792 --> 06:13.249
You forgot to pay me.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.327
Fat lung,

06:15.333 --> 06:16.573
same as before.

06:16.583 --> 06:17.823
Put it on my tab.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.164
Hey, your tab is a mile long

06:20.167 --> 06:22.158
you must pay it all today.

06:22.375 --> 06:23.375
Tomorrow.

06:23.708 --> 06:25.619
I'll pay you tomorrow. Promise.

06:26.417 --> 06:27.907
It's not my decision

06:28.042 --> 06:29.748
tell the boss yourself.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.117
Hey boss!

06:32.125 --> 06:33.331
She's broke again.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.125
Hey boss!

06:52.125 --> 06:53.285
Sorry, kit.

07:03.875 --> 07:04.990
Here boss.

07:13.625 --> 07:15.115
Who needs your sympathy?

07:22.042 --> 07:23.077
Make a call.

07:23.917 --> 07:25.282
Get someone to bring money.

07:30.708 --> 07:32.289
If you don't pay up now

07:32.417 --> 07:34.578
I'll sell you to a brothel

07:34.833 --> 07:36.164
in the south pacific.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.250
Excuse me!

07:54.625 --> 07:55.990
Can I see the black bat?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Sure!

08:10.708 --> 08:11.743
I'll take it.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.410
Please wrap it up for me.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.080
Eat!

08:34.707 --> 08:35.743
Julial

08:38.375 --> 08:40.081
well look who's here?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.206
I brought the money.

08:43.582 --> 08:44.583
Let her go!

08:45.875 --> 08:46.875
Count it.

08:51.208 --> 08:52.539
I'm warning you.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.249
Don't sell opium to her again.

08:55.792 --> 08:57.578
But she wants me to.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.616
Talk to her, not me.

09:04.750 --> 09:06.240
You beat her up.

09:06.542 --> 09:07.748
I'm letting that slide.

09:08.167 --> 09:09.577
If you hit her again,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.323
I'll make sure you pay for it.

09:13.583 --> 09:14.583
Hold on!

09:18.542 --> 09:20.078
This is just the principal.

09:20.625 --> 09:21.740
What about interest?

09:22.542 --> 09:24.282
I need 500 more.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.407
You won't get another dime,

09:26.917 --> 09:28.828
Nana's coming with me.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.365
I'd like to see

09:30.667 --> 09:31.873
what you can do about it.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.991
With no more money you're not leaving!

09:34.250 --> 09:35.250
Grab them!

10:15.542 --> 10:17.032
You broke my present.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.083
Get lost!

10:46.583 --> 10:47.583
Go!

10:52.083 --> 10:53.083
Go on!

11:09.292 --> 11:10.077
Police!

11:10.083 --> 11:11.493
What's going on?

11:12.500 --> 11:13.990
Freeze! What are you doing!

11:15.375 --> 11:16.205
Freeze!

11:16.375 --> 11:17.410
Arrest them all!

11:17.417 --> 11:19.499
Stop!

11:19.958 --> 11:21.038
Police business!

11:21.417 --> 11:22.327
What's going on?

11:22.333 --> 11:23.333
Why were you fighting?

11:26.750 --> 11:28.331
- Officer...
- You're coming as well.

11:28.542 --> 11:29.542
Move it!

11:31.917 --> 11:32.781
Sit over there!

11:32.833 --> 11:33.913
Move it!

11:41.333 --> 11:42.573
What's your name?

11:43.500 --> 11:44.114
Cheung tin chi.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.331
Where do you work?

11:45.917 --> 11:47.032
Tin kee store.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.456
Our records show,

11:49.833 --> 11:51.414
cheung tin chi

11:51.417 --> 11:53.203
is active in underground boxing arenas

11:53.208 --> 11:54.573
as a fighter.

11:55.292 --> 12:00.241
You were arrested,
at the west union shipyard

12:00.250 --> 12:01.581
for gang fighting before.
We have it all here.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.073
I was helping someone.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.414
Oh like you did today?

12:04.417 --> 12:05.417
That's right!

12:05.708 --> 12:07.073
He was helping us.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.539
I'm not talking to you.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.448
Listen up,

12:11.458 --> 12:12.994
fighting anywhere in public

12:13.000 --> 12:14.740
is against the law.

12:18.708 --> 12:19.708
You!

12:23.292 --> 12:24.156
Sir?

12:24.167 --> 12:25.623
It's just self-defense

12:25.750 --> 12:26.785
let them all go.

12:26.792 --> 12:27.451
Huh?

12:27.458 --> 12:28.948
This is an order!

12:33.667 --> 12:34.952
No problem sir.

12:40.042 --> 12:41.452
Why'd you get in a fight

12:41.708 --> 12:43.039
let them all go.

12:54.583 --> 12:55.583
Hey!

12:55.833 --> 12:57.949
Why can they leave and we can't go?

13:00.250 --> 13:01.365
Who the hell are you?

13:01.375 --> 13:03.457
I'm chiu kam fu's sister.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.161
That's the guy who owns gold bar.

13:06.167 --> 13:07.498
What a pain!

13:07.500 --> 13:08.831
Yeah you can go!

13:09.500 --> 13:12.742
Thank you... lets go

13:18.292 --> 13:19.292
Officer,

13:20.250 --> 13:21.740
when can I go?

13:24.833 --> 13:26.539
Take a new statement from him.

13:27.042 --> 13:28.623
You can go after that.

13:35.333 --> 13:39.076
It's almost 10 o'clock. Where is he?

13:42.958 --> 13:43.697
Fung!

13:43.875 --> 13:44.739
- Quick hurry!
- You're late!

13:44.750 --> 13:46.490
Give me back my allowance from last month.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.205
Okay!

13:47.208 --> 13:48.914
- I know! I'm changing.
- Take off your pants!

13:48.917 --> 13:49.872
- I'm changing okay?
- Hurry!

13:49.875 --> 13:50.830
I'll help you...

13:50.833 --> 13:52.164
Papa! Hurry!

13:52.167 --> 13:52.952
I'm coming

13:52.958 --> 13:54.869
hey your zipper is down!

13:55.083 --> 13:56.083
Okay!

14:00.208 --> 14:01.197
Here! Come on.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.368
Quick!

14:04.583 --> 14:05.868
Papa! Hurry hurry!

14:05.958 --> 14:06.993
Coming coming!

14:13.542 --> 14:14.577
Hello!

14:16.458 --> 14:18.244
Sorry, we're closed.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.411
Birthday! Birthday me!

14:20.417 --> 14:21.907
Sorry, young man.

14:22.292 --> 14:24.533
All of our chefs have
gone home for the night.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.241
Come back anytime.

14:32.583 --> 14:33.823
Okay? Come back!

14:37.417 --> 14:39.499
It's your fault!

14:50.375 --> 14:51.911
You can't have steak,

14:52.583 --> 14:53.948
but you still have a present.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.116
Wow! It's black bat!

15:13.292 --> 15:14.281
Papal!

15:14.292 --> 15:15.623
There's no music!

15:16.000 --> 15:17.456
How come?

15:20.042 --> 15:20.781
It can't be.

15:20.792 --> 15:23.955
Papa it's alright, it's a gift from you.
I love it

15:29.875 --> 15:31.081
So boss.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.368
Other than steak,

15:32.375 --> 15:33.535
what else do you want to eat?

15:34.458 --> 15:35.743
Braised beef,

15:35.750 --> 15:37.365
fried beef with Kale...

15:37.375 --> 15:38.865
Tomato and beef stew!

15:38.875 --> 15:40.206
Nothing but beef?

15:40.208 --> 15:41.869
You have something against beef?

15:42.167 --> 15:43.167
Very well.

15:43.417 --> 15:44.953
Let's go.

15:44.958 --> 15:46.243
We'll have a beef feast.

15:54.583 --> 15:55.823
Cheung lok

15:55.833 --> 15:57.664
is the number one gang,

15:57.667 --> 15:59.203
not because we have the most members

15:59.208 --> 16:01.540
or the most money.

16:01.542 --> 16:04.784
But because we have trust.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.698
But I just found out

16:06.708 --> 16:09.245
one of our own has been stealing from us.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.999
My father used to say:

16:12.000 --> 16:13.456
Without trust,

16:13.458 --> 16:14.994
a man has nothing.

16:15.958 --> 16:17.994
Remember that uncle hung?

16:18.917 --> 16:19.906
I remember!

16:19.917 --> 16:22.124
Your old man and I started out together.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.783
These scars you see here.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.659
Helped him carve out his
turf and make his name.

16:29.042 --> 16:30.703
So what if I took some money?

16:30.708 --> 16:31.914
What's the problem?

16:32.542 --> 16:33.827
There's no problem.

16:38.292 --> 16:40.032
Even if you're a founding member

16:40.042 --> 16:42.454
doesn't mean you can break the rules.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.365
Take him home.

16:50.375 --> 16:51.410
Today,

16:51.708 --> 16:53.744
I want to discuss something
important with you.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.161
It's about cheung lok's future.

16:56.167 --> 16:57.498
I am planning

16:57.500 --> 16:59.240
to legalize our business

16:59.250 --> 17:00.250
completely.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.322
In 3 years,

17:01.333 --> 17:02.493
I want cheung lok

17:02.500 --> 17:04.080
to be squeaky clean.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.414
Your decision

17:05.458 --> 17:07.618
will have a major impact on business.

17:07.625 --> 17:08.489
That's right!

17:08.500 --> 17:10.365
Been a gangster all my life.

17:10.541 --> 17:11.952
It's the only thing I know.

17:12.708 --> 17:13.867
And trading

17:13.875 --> 17:15.740
isn't as profitable as smuggling.

17:15.750 --> 17:16.829
Listen!

17:17.083 --> 17:18.698
I can't guarantee that

17:18.708 --> 17:21.575
we'll make as much money
as we do in the black market.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.414
But I can promise you

17:23.416 --> 17:25.328
that from now on.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.368
No one will have to go to jail

17:27.375 --> 17:29.411
or get himself killed.

17:29.750 --> 17:30.990
If you ask me,

17:31.208 --> 17:32.618
it's the opposite.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.953
Cheung lok now has clout.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.365
We should capitalize

17:36.375 --> 17:37.410
and we expand!

17:37.417 --> 17:39.157
Consolidate our position.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.452
With enough weight,

17:40.917 --> 17:43.203
neither side of the law
will dare mess with us!

17:44.958 --> 17:46.823
Since we have different opinions,

17:47.125 --> 17:48.911
let us vote to decide.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.369
Those in favor of legalizing cheung lok

17:51.375 --> 17:52.660
raise your hands.

18:09.292 --> 18:10.577
You're the boss,

18:10.917 --> 18:11.747
you call the shots.

18:11.750 --> 18:12.785
Thank you!

18:12.917 --> 18:15.374
From now on,

18:15.375 --> 18:16.455
we should refrain, from using violence.

18:16.458 --> 18:17.789
Let's work together

18:18.125 --> 18:19.786
to transform cheung lok.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.199
Wow black bat is so amazing!

18:29.208 --> 18:31.164
He took out all the bad
guys with 3 punches!

18:31.167 --> 18:32.167
Well...

18:32.417 --> 18:33.702
My dad is more awesome.

18:33.708 --> 18:36.074
He can knock down the
baddies with one punch.

18:36.208 --> 18:38.119
He's the grandmaster of wing chun.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.328
That's a lie, cheung fung!

18:42.167 --> 18:43.953
My father is the grandmaster.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.662
He runs a martial arts
club and he's brilliant.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.953
Papa used to own a club as well.

18:56.958 --> 18:58.414
My dad is the best around!

18:58.417 --> 18:59.281
Used to?!

18:59.292 --> 19:01.032
Now he runs a tiny store.

19:01.042 --> 19:02.282
He's a grocery man.

19:02.667 --> 19:03.827
Grocery man...

19:03.833 --> 19:05.164
Grocery man...

19:05.167 --> 19:06.953
Papa is the grandmaster of wing chun.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.615
He's a grocery man.

19:23.833 --> 19:24.868
Let's eat...

19:28.958 --> 19:29.663
Not hungry?

19:29.667 --> 19:31.328
They call you a grocery man.

19:31.917 --> 19:33.032
And that's what I am.

19:33.042 --> 19:34.282
You're not!

19:45.625 --> 19:46.660
Papa,

19:47.000 --> 19:48.536
I'm sorry... l

19:48.542 --> 19:49.577
forget it.

19:49.917 --> 19:51.077
Let's eat.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.663
Papal!

20:11.500 --> 20:14.082
You won't teach wing chun anymore?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.080
Go sleep.

20:37.625 --> 20:40.116
"Cheung tin chi,
the rising star in martial arts world"

20:43.583 --> 20:45.915
"cheung tin chi, undefeated in wing chun"

21:32.167 --> 21:34.032
Papa, help me!

21:34.375 --> 21:35.615
- Papa!
- Fung!

21:35.625 --> 21:36.614
I'm scared!

21:36.625 --> 21:37.660
Papal!

21:37.792 --> 21:39.123
- Fung!
- It's on fire!

21:40.375 --> 21:41.911
- Papa!
- Come, don't be afraid

21:43.792 --> 21:46.659
- papa I'm scared!
- Don't worry!

21:46.708 --> 21:48.164
Papa is here, don't worry.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.373
Papa hurry up!

22:00.375 --> 22:01.080
Don't worry.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.744
- Almost done!
- I can't breathe! Papal!

22:03.500 --> 22:04.865
Hurry!

22:09.250 --> 22:11.411
Papa hurry!

22:14.375 --> 22:16.115
Come here, fung!

22:20.708 --> 22:21.708
Here use this!

22:55.500 --> 22:56.500
Fung!

22:57.000 --> 22:57.785
Fung!

22:57.833 --> 22:59.118
Papal!

23:00.292 --> 23:02.032
Don't worry...

23:02.125 --> 23:04.081
Here come, sit down.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.243
Don't worry...

23:11.083 --> 23:13.574
Crossing you is the same as crossing me.

23:13.583 --> 23:15.539
I'll kill him for you today.

23:21.625 --> 23:22.614
Oh come on.

23:22.625 --> 23:23.956
He still got out?!

23:25.167 --> 23:26.623
Are you sure you can handle it?

23:31.458 --> 23:32.789
Papa! Papa!

23:33.083 --> 23:35.369
Papal!

23:42.625 --> 23:43.831
Kill him!

23:43.833 --> 23:45.118
Quick!

23:56.125 --> 23:59.083
I got a plan for people like him.

24:10.667 --> 24:12.578
Stop! Stop!

24:19.625 --> 24:21.581
Please watch my son! I beg you!

24:21.833 --> 24:22.913
Thank you!

24:23.667 --> 24:25.328
Papa papa...

26:30.333 --> 26:31.333
Fung!

26:32.375 --> 26:33.375
Fung!

28:27.333 --> 28:29.119
Hey! Your son has fainted!

28:31.625 --> 28:32.625
Fung!

28:35.167 --> 28:36.167
He's got a fever.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.413
Take him to a hospital.

28:37.542 --> 28:38.542
Quick!

28:40.083 --> 28:41.083
Fung!

28:50.417 --> 28:52.954
Miss kwan, kit is causing trouble again.

29:02.292 --> 29:03.953
Papa, it hurts!

29:05.792 --> 29:08.408
Bear with it. You'll be fine soon.

29:10.750 --> 29:14.117
I don't want to be here. I want to go home.

29:18.042 --> 29:19.042
Here...

29:19.167 --> 29:20.953
Why don't you have an apple?

29:21.917 --> 29:23.077
Look!

29:32.583 --> 29:33.583
Thank you!

29:34.667 --> 29:35.667
It's fine.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.073
Move aside.

29:41.833 --> 29:44.415
Here. Ahh!

29:46.833 --> 29:48.073
The boy is seriously hurt.

29:48.083 --> 29:49.573
What kind of parents are you?

30:05.667 --> 30:06.702
Yes, sir!

30:07.583 --> 30:08.823
Understand, sir!

30:19.958 --> 30:21.414
We know what happened.

30:21.417 --> 30:23.373
It was an accident. Let's go.

30:23.375 --> 30:24.375
Officer,

30:24.542 --> 30:25.827
I know who did it.

30:25.833 --> 30:27.039
I told you,

30:27.042 --> 30:28.407
it was an acc-i-dent!

30:28.417 --> 30:29.532
How is that possible?

30:29.542 --> 30:31.703
They burnt his home and tried to kill him.

30:31.708 --> 30:33.039
Why won't you investigate?!

30:33.333 --> 30:35.870
It's a police matter. Don't lecture me!

30:36.625 --> 30:37.740
Let's go!

30:43.000 --> 30:44.035
Papal!

30:45.708 --> 30:48.871
If our house is burnt
down, where will we go?

30:53.708 --> 30:55.073
I can help you.

30:56.292 --> 30:57.998
My brother owns gold bar.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.410
I'll take you to meet him.

30:59.750 --> 31:01.365
I bought you new clothes.

31:01.375 --> 31:02.364
You're meeting the boss,

31:02.375 --> 31:04.081
so you need to look presentable.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.286
Julia. You're early!

31:08.958 --> 31:10.038
Ming, where's my brother?

31:10.042 --> 31:11.327
He's in a meeting.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.365
That's not fair at all!

31:13.750 --> 31:15.365
You stole all of my customers.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.581
I want you to pay for my loss.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.119
You should pay me. I'm losing money too.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.956
I said it first! No you I said you...

31:23.500 --> 31:24.910
You guys are both wrong!

31:24.917 --> 31:26.703
We just want Harmony on bar street.

31:26.708 --> 31:27.788
You two!

31:28.042 --> 31:29.452
Drink what I made you

31:32.750 --> 31:34.160
and stop fighting.

31:34.542 --> 31:35.873
No price war either!

31:36.375 --> 31:37.490
Drink up!

31:41.458 --> 31:42.368
What's wrong?

31:42.375 --> 31:43.455
Is there a problem?

31:43.458 --> 31:44.698
No... no...

31:48.458 --> 31:49.948
It's delicious, fu!

31:49.958 --> 31:51.164
- Nice!
- We should go.

31:51.167 --> 31:52.373
Yeah... bye

31:53.417 --> 31:55.282
fu, Julia is here.

31:58.625 --> 31:59.614
Brother.

31:59.625 --> 32:01.456
This is my friend cheung tin chi.

32:04.875 --> 32:06.285
He's in a bit of a bind.

32:06.875 --> 32:08.035
I want to take them in.

32:08.042 --> 32:09.157
What's that?

32:09.167 --> 32:10.282
No...

32:10.667 --> 32:12.282
Staying with you is a bad idea.

32:12.292 --> 32:13.532
You live with Nana.

32:13.542 --> 32:14.782
Let them live with me.

32:15.208 --> 32:16.744
Hey kid, come here!

32:17.167 --> 32:18.907
You're scaring him!

32:18.917 --> 32:20.748
How can he stay with you?

32:21.458 --> 32:22.698
I'm sorry.

32:22.708 --> 32:23.914
We'll go

32:25.333 --> 32:26.493
no wait.

32:28.833 --> 32:29.913
Fu,

32:29.917 --> 32:31.578
tin chi saved me and Nana.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.160
You taught me that,

32:33.167 --> 32:35.032
friends have a moral
obligation to each other.

32:37.708 --> 32:38.708
Fine fine.

32:42.583 --> 32:44.119
Listen carefully. These two girls

32:45.417 --> 32:47.328
one is my sister,

32:47.375 --> 32:49.331
one is my future wife.

32:49.417 --> 32:50.327
They're off limits.

32:50.333 --> 32:51.493
Don't even think about it.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.456
I can pay rent.

32:54.458 --> 32:55.948
Let me work at the bar.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.410
I'll work in exchange for a place to stay.

32:57.417 --> 32:58.497
Whatever!

32:58.500 --> 33:00.411
Make sure you show up on time tonight.

33:03.458 --> 33:04.698
Come on in!

33:10.125 --> 33:11.865
Just make yourselves at home.

33:11.875 --> 33:13.115
Don't be shy.

33:16.583 --> 33:17.663
Nana!

33:20.667 --> 33:22.373
Stop walking around like that!

33:22.375 --> 33:23.706
You're practically naked!

33:24.875 --> 33:26.456
You usually wear less than me!

33:26.458 --> 33:28.198
When do I wear less than you?

33:29.333 --> 33:31.494
I always dress properly.

33:31.500 --> 33:32.706
Believe me.

33:43.625 --> 33:46.162
Papa, papa. There's a fire!

33:46.167 --> 33:47.167
Papal!

33:47.750 --> 33:48.580
Papal!

33:48.750 --> 33:49.830
Fung!

33:49.833 --> 33:50.833
It's okay.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.240
I'm here.

33:52.750 --> 33:54.991
It's fine...

34:14.250 --> 34:15.250
Who's that?

34:27.292 --> 34:28.327
Where's tso sai kit.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.368
He's not here.

34:32.458 --> 34:33.458
Out!

35:15.958 --> 35:18.665
Dancing with me together, come in!

35:20.000 --> 35:21.490
Buy me one drink.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.535
Buy me one drink.

35:23.833 --> 35:25.198
Come.

35:50.542 --> 35:52.032
No...

35:53.667 --> 35:55.032
Hello.

35:55.917 --> 35:57.202

36:00.625 --> 36:01.740
Let me.

36:03.375 --> 36:04.831
Thank you!

36:06.333 --> 36:07.994
Hey! It's cheung!

36:29.375 --> 36:32.913
"Kiss me, honey, honey, kiss me"

36:33.250 --> 36:36.822
"thrill me, honey, honey, thrill me"

36:37.250 --> 36:40.572
"don't care even if I blow my top"

36:40.583 --> 36:43.746
"but, honey honey, don't stop..."

36:45.583 --> 36:48.825
"I'd like to play a little game with you"

36:49.583 --> 36:52.700
"a little game especially made for two"

36:53.250 --> 36:56.663
"if you come close then
I will show you how"

36:56.958 --> 37:00.496
"closer, closer, now"

37:00.917 --> 37:04.489
"kiss me, honey, honey, kiss me"

37:04.917 --> 37:08.205
"thrill me, honey, honey, thrill me"

37:08.792 --> 37:12.034
"don't care even if I blow my top"

37:12.625 --> 37:15.617
"but, honey honey, don't stop..."

37:21.208 --> 37:22.208
Are you blind?

37:22.875 --> 37:23.875
Pick it up.

37:26.708 --> 37:28.494
You make money from me.

37:30.083 --> 37:32.790
I gave you an order, you follow it.

37:33.792 --> 37:34.827
Pick it up.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Pick

37:38.125 --> 37:39.125
up!

37:53.125 --> 37:54.160
Sorry sorry.

37:54.292 --> 37:55.907
He's new.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.161
Happy happy...

37:58.333 --> 37:59.163
Kam,

37:59.167 --> 38:00.373
take care of him.

38:00.667 --> 38:02.953
My friend, come on, come on.

38:05.833 --> 38:07.824
You! Come here!

38:10.292 --> 38:11.577
"Don't stop..."

38:15.542 --> 38:16.542
Cheung tin chi,

38:16.833 --> 38:17.833
who do you think you are?

38:18.042 --> 38:19.907
Is it humiliating to pick it up?

38:20.625 --> 38:22.616
Pride is not worth a dime here understand?

38:23.042 --> 38:24.042
I picked it up.

38:24.208 --> 38:25.823
There's a rule here on bar street.

38:26.208 --> 38:27.288
Customers are always right.

38:27.542 --> 38:31.114
Don't you ever for... get.

38:44.208 --> 38:45.038
Allow me.

38:45.083 --> 38:46.083
No I can manage.

38:46.625 --> 38:47.990
I'm happy to do it.

38:49.375 --> 38:51.582
Fung, eat your breakfast.

38:57.167 --> 38:58.953
Why is it congee again?

39:02.375 --> 39:04.707
It was just your first day at the bar.

39:05.167 --> 39:07.203
And I know everything is new.

39:07.208 --> 39:08.664
But you'll get used to it.

39:11.542 --> 39:12.542
I mean,

39:13.042 --> 39:14.828
you put up with so much.

39:14.833 --> 39:16.323
How can you bear it?

39:18.083 --> 39:21.075
Our job is to make the customers happy.

39:21.083 --> 39:23.574
Just smile and it'll blow over.

39:23.583 --> 39:24.663
Oh and,

39:24.667 --> 39:26.157
please don't be angry with my brother.

39:26.167 --> 39:28.203
He's worried you'd offend the foreigners.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.498
Sure. It's forgotten.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.615
Papa, does it hurt?

39:38.083 --> 39:39.163
No way!

39:54.750 --> 39:55.910
Who did this?

39:55.917 --> 39:57.032
Cheung tin chi.

39:58.917 --> 40:00.077
Stop!

40:05.625 --> 40:07.115
This is my opium den.

40:07.750 --> 40:08.956
I'll take care of it.

40:08.958 --> 40:10.823
This is cheung lok business.

40:11.292 --> 40:13.283
I made it clear to everyone.

40:13.292 --> 40:14.873
No more trouble.

40:15.417 --> 40:17.282
If you can't handle it,

40:17.292 --> 40:18.623
I'll take over.

40:18.625 --> 40:19.910
The place is burned down.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.282
Just shut it down.

40:22.792 --> 40:24.282
And no vengeance.

40:25.042 --> 40:27.249
Don't compromise cheung lok's reputation.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.740
No vengeance?

40:28.750 --> 40:29.785
What's wrong with vengeance?

40:29.792 --> 40:30.952
If 1 let him go,

40:30.958 --> 40:32.323
that would be wrong!

40:34.958 --> 40:35.947
Brothers!

40:35.958 --> 40:38.244
We're going to kill cheung tin chi!

40:45.500 --> 40:47.582
Take kit home.

40:50.042 --> 40:51.282
Don't forget his medicine.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.203
I don't need sympathy.

40:57.500 --> 40:58.660
Follow him.

41:22.167 --> 41:23.156
Please enjoy!

41:23.167 --> 41:24.907
This drink is for you.

41:29.333 --> 41:30.743
I'm working right now.

41:33.167 --> 41:35.078
It's okay. I'm buying.

41:53.208 --> 41:54.072
Impressive!

41:54.083 --> 41:55.198
Who are you?

41:56.708 --> 41:58.369
My brother burnt down your house.

41:58.375 --> 42:00.206
This is for your house.

42:00.458 --> 42:02.824
I hope we can put all this behind us.

42:04.583 --> 42:06.539
I burnt down his opium den.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.661
This is for his opium den.

42:08.667 --> 42:10.282
Don't bother me again.

42:10.917 --> 42:12.453
Not many people would dare to

42:12.917 --> 42:14.373
use that tone with me.

42:14.375 --> 42:15.375
Miss kwan!

42:16.583 --> 42:18.665
What brings you here?

42:18.667 --> 42:20.578
We have catching up to do.

42:21.125 --> 42:23.582
I also came to meet your new friend.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.115
Tin chi,

42:28.125 --> 42:30.207
miss kwan is my benefactor.

42:30.583 --> 42:31.993
I used to work for her.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.740
Everyone has heard of

42:33.750 --> 42:35.206
cheung lok, and tso ngan kwan.

42:35.833 --> 42:36.993
Fu,

42:37.000 --> 42:38.080
that's enough.

42:38.417 --> 42:40.373
Miss kwan made me what I am today!

42:40.375 --> 42:41.535
I should go.

42:41.583 --> 42:42.572
Cheung tin chi,

42:42.583 --> 42:43.572
you have personality.

42:43.583 --> 42:44.868
I won't force your hand.

42:44.875 --> 42:45.580
From now on,

42:45.583 --> 42:46.618
if you need anything,

42:46.625 --> 42:48.115
just come to me.

42:49.000 --> 42:49.864
Remember.

42:49.875 --> 42:51.411
Put it behind you.

42:51.417 --> 42:52.247
This cheque,

42:52.250 --> 42:53.490
covers my tab.

42:55.083 --> 42:56.038
Miss kwan,

42:56.042 --> 42:57.452
let me buy a round!

43:08.125 --> 43:09.331
Impressive!

43:10.250 --> 43:12.662
Remember we used to play
with water pistols?

43:13.458 --> 43:14.618
Then peashooters

43:14.625 --> 43:15.705
and now real guns.

43:15.708 --> 43:17.164
You're such a sharpshooter.

43:17.167 --> 43:18.327
Impressive!

43:20.167 --> 43:21.407
What is it?

43:21.417 --> 43:23.078
You're the heir of cheung lok.

43:23.083 --> 43:24.414
And your sister has your back.

43:24.417 --> 43:25.281
So what's wrong?

43:25.292 --> 43:26.577
You look down on me now?

43:26.583 --> 43:28.244
Why would you think that?

43:28.250 --> 43:29.911
I'm just telling you the truth.

43:30.458 --> 43:33.291
Every shot must have its purpose.

43:34.125 --> 43:35.490
She's always the boss.

43:35.833 --> 43:38.415
She's just telling me
what I can and can't do.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.490
How can I make it big?

43:41.625 --> 43:43.286
Because you were born too late.

43:43.667 --> 43:44.667
Honestly.

43:47.167 --> 43:48.657
I told you.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.615
You should be independent.

43:51.167 --> 43:52.623
It's not easy.

43:57.917 --> 43:59.123
Is it that hard?

44:00.792 --> 44:02.202
If you don't try it.

44:02.208 --> 44:03.618
You have nothing.

44:04.458 --> 44:06.164
If you dare to dream.

44:06.167 --> 44:07.167
It's all possible.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.706
You seem to be,

44:09.708 --> 44:10.914
doing well.

44:11.917 --> 44:13.202
What have you been up to?

44:13.208 --> 44:14.573
Just small business.

44:14.583 --> 44:15.993
You wouldn't dare do it.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.536
I sell heroin.

44:19.042 --> 44:20.202
What's there to be afraid of?

44:21.042 --> 44:22.373
If we do this,

44:22.375 --> 44:23.865
we can be the biggest game in town.

44:24.542 --> 44:26.102
Wan chai district is under our control.

44:27.583 --> 44:29.289
We can sell on bar street.

44:29.292 --> 44:30.623
The bars are always busy.

44:30.917 --> 44:31.917
Good.

44:32.375 --> 44:33.740
We'll be partners.

44:33.750 --> 44:34.535
Count me in.

44:34.542 --> 44:35.748
Are you out of your mind?

44:35.750 --> 44:37.240
Partners?

44:37.250 --> 44:39.241
If your sister finds out,

44:39.250 --> 44:40.706
she'll chop me up and feed me to the dogs.

44:40.708 --> 44:41.743
Besides,

44:41.750 --> 44:43.615
don't mess with chiu kam fu.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.580
I won't man.

44:46.208 --> 44:47.368
There's no way.

44:48.667 --> 44:49.873
Leave my sister to me.

44:49.875 --> 44:51.081
I'll sort it out.

44:51.667 --> 44:52.452
As for fu,

44:52.458 --> 44:53.573
if you can't.

44:53.583 --> 44:54.698
I will.

44:59.167 --> 45:00.247
Good!

45:01.625 --> 45:02.740
We're brothers.

45:02.750 --> 45:03.705
You got my back

45:03.708 --> 45:04.743
and I have your back.

45:04.750 --> 45:05.739
We're partners now.

45:05.750 --> 45:07.661
We'll make money together!

45:07.667 --> 45:08.907
Here's to us.

45:08.917 --> 45:10.407
Cheers!

45:28.333 --> 45:29.493
Hey!

45:31.292 --> 45:33.078
This is rent for the month.

45:33.083 --> 45:34.914
I told you I would pay.

45:36.458 --> 45:37.948
Keep it and buy some candy for your son.

45:37.958 --> 45:39.243
Buy it yourself.

45:39.958 --> 45:41.619
Always so much pride.

45:43.750 --> 45:44.705
Hey!

45:44.708 --> 45:47.950
I heard you used to practise
orthodox wing chun.

45:47.958 --> 45:50.916
You challenged ip man but
he refused to fight.

45:50.917 --> 45:51.952
That's something.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.824
I want to challenge ip man.

45:57.750 --> 46:00.036
Why did you close your dojo?

46:00.542 --> 46:01.622
I didn't want to teach anymore.

46:01.625 --> 46:03.115
Didn't want to teach?

46:03.542 --> 46:05.498
You were at the top of the game.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.115
Let me see what you got.

46:07.125 --> 46:08.581
Let's have a go.

46:09.125 --> 46:10.285
I don't remember.

46:10.583 --> 46:11.618
Quit playing.

46:13.250 --> 46:14.581
How about...

46:14.583 --> 46:17.199
The loser has to take the money.

46:44.333 --> 46:46.289
Punching from mid air is
such a stupid mistake.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.410
I like somersaults.

46:48.417 --> 46:49.497
What's it to you?

46:57.208 --> 46:58.744
I'm a grown man,

46:58.750 --> 47:00.866
no one has ever slapped me before.

47:00.875 --> 47:01.910
How dare you!

47:01.917 --> 47:03.282
You like to fight.

47:03.292 --> 47:05.172
I'm disciplining you on
behalf of your parents.

47:06.208 --> 47:07.493
Asshole!

47:09.750 --> 47:10.990
Again?

47:11.875 --> 47:12.830
You swore.

47:12.833 --> 47:13.913
You deserved it.

47:14.833 --> 47:16.448
Can you fight me properly?

47:16.458 --> 47:18.039
Don't slap me.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.456
Why don't you use wing chun?

47:53.625 --> 47:55.536
I don't need wing chun now.

48:01.125 --> 48:02.956
Can't you show me some respect?

48:03.458 --> 48:04.914
I'll have you fired!

48:08.042 --> 48:09.248
Money's yours.

48:09.667 --> 48:11.077
Hey! Keep it a secret!

48:11.083 --> 48:12.289
Don't tell anyone.

48:12.292 --> 48:14.374
Don't tell anyone you beat me.

48:40.833 --> 48:42.198
Nothing left.

48:53.250 --> 48:54.456
This is still intact.

48:54.958 --> 48:56.289
The music box.

49:09.667 --> 49:10.667
Julial

49:10.875 --> 49:12.831
that's not how you do it.

49:13.458 --> 49:14.994
Let me show you.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.411
You're pretty good.

49:22.417 --> 49:24.032
Did your father teach you?

49:24.333 --> 49:26.164
He used to teach me wing chun.

49:26.167 --> 49:27.782
But not anymore.

49:28.083 --> 49:28.788
Julia,

49:28.792 --> 49:30.123
I can teach you wing chun.

49:30.167 --> 49:30.826
Really?

49:30.833 --> 49:31.322
Yes.

49:31.333 --> 49:32.743
Well then thank you shifu!

49:33.500 --> 49:35.036
See if this is right.

49:57.667 --> 49:58.372
Sorry!

49:58.375 --> 49:59.375
I'm so sorry!

49:59.833 --> 50:00.868
It's alright.

50:01.542 --> 50:02.702
Sorry...

50:03.292 --> 50:04.702
I'l fix it.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.865
I only use it to hang clothes.

50:12.708 --> 50:13.708
Let's go.

50:19.042 --> 50:22.205
Fung, I used to check out the balcony.

50:22.292 --> 50:23.077
What's out there?

50:23.083 --> 50:24.289
The sunrise.

50:24.750 --> 50:25.830
Sunrise?

50:26.417 --> 50:27.907
More like moon rise.

50:36.292 --> 50:38.078
When the lights come on over bar street,

50:38.083 --> 50:39.573
that's my sunrise.

50:40.375 --> 50:41.740
When the lights come on,

50:41.750 --> 50:44.787
I'm able to forget all the
unhappy things in my life.

50:46.667 --> 50:48.498
You're easy to please.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.706
You can be so...

50:50.708 --> 50:52.244
So simple!

50:54.750 --> 50:56.991
Happiness should be simple.

50:57.458 --> 51:00.370
If I can do the things I like every day,

51:00.375 --> 51:01.865
I'll be very happy.

51:03.208 --> 51:05.995
What do you think I like to do?

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Eat?

51:07.083 --> 51:08.948
That means he thinks you're dumb.

51:09.333 --> 51:10.823
He's talking about you.

51:10.833 --> 51:12.915
Papa, who are you talking about?

51:13.750 --> 51:15.206
You, of course!

51:15.708 --> 51:18.324
Two adults bullying a kid!?

51:22.042 --> 51:23.748
You're not really angry.

51:26.292 --> 51:29.249
What makes me happy.

51:29.250 --> 51:32.572
Is being at gold bar every day,
singing and dancing.

51:32.583 --> 51:35.165
That's how I can show my talent.

51:37.292 --> 51:39.453
When you find the place where you belong,

51:39.958 --> 51:41.573
win or lose,

51:41.583 --> 51:43.289
you won't want to leave.

51:43.792 --> 51:45.578
I don't think that's true.

51:46.083 --> 51:47.744
Whether I come or go,

51:47.750 --> 51:49.331
is a matter of choice.

51:49.875 --> 51:53.618
Well it might be a choice
that you made in a fit of anger.

51:53.625 --> 51:56.332
And when you calm down you'll realize that,

51:57.292 --> 52:00.989
you left that day, so you
could return one day.

52:19.250 --> 52:21.491
Dad, I finally got my steak!

52:22.083 --> 52:24.825
Fung. It's your belated birthday party.

52:24.833 --> 52:26.824
Eat as much as you like.

52:26.833 --> 52:28.164
I'll take you up on that!

52:28.167 --> 52:29.167
Brother.

52:29.417 --> 52:31.999
Just cause he's buying, don't pig out

52:32.708 --> 52:34.414
thanks for inviting us.

52:34.417 --> 52:35.623
It's my pleasure.

52:39.542 --> 52:40.702
Actually,

52:41.125 --> 52:42.956
I should thank all of you.

52:43.875 --> 52:45.490
I barged into your lives.

52:45.500 --> 52:48.082
Yet you all greeted me with open arms.

52:48.750 --> 52:50.365
And took such good care of fung.

52:50.375 --> 52:52.707
I'm very honored to have friends like you.

52:52.708 --> 52:54.573
Here. A toast to you!

52:54.583 --> 52:55.993
Who said we were friends?

52:56.458 --> 52:58.039
On bar street,

52:58.708 --> 53:00.289
we're all family.

53:01.083 --> 53:03.540
Here. Cheers!

53:05.750 --> 53:07.536
Happy birthday!

53:08.042 --> 53:09.452
This is for you.

53:11.500 --> 53:13.616
Wow! It's black bat.

53:14.250 --> 53:16.241
I volunteer at an orphanage.

53:16.250 --> 53:17.911
A child there made that for me.

53:18.542 --> 53:19.907
Mr. Davidson,

53:19.917 --> 53:21.123
thanks for the arrangements,

53:21.125 --> 53:22.490
and the beautiful cake.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.910
You are very welcome.

53:24.125 --> 53:26.207
I have other guests to attend to.

53:26.208 --> 53:28.164
So, excuse me. Have a wonderful time.

53:28.750 --> 53:29.956
- Thank you!
- Bye bye!

53:47.667 --> 53:50.283
Good evening everyone and welcome.

53:50.292 --> 53:52.078
Our humble organization,

53:52.083 --> 53:55.951
strives to stimulate the Hong Kong economy,

53:55.958 --> 53:59.121
but we also want to give
back to the community.

53:59.125 --> 54:02.288
So tonight's proceeds for
our charity auction,

54:02.292 --> 54:07.036
will go towards rebuilding homes destroyed
in the recent typhoons.

54:07.250 --> 54:12.290
There we can show everyone
how big our hearts are

54:12.292 --> 54:16.285
and how deep our pockets are.

54:17.250 --> 54:20.242
And our first item up for bid is this

54:20.417 --> 54:23.614
beautiful antique qing dynasty vase.

54:23.667 --> 54:26.625
The bidding will start at $5,000.

54:27.625 --> 54:29.661
$10,000!

54:30.250 --> 54:30.955
$12,000!

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
$12,000!

54:32.625 --> 54:33.625
$15,000!

54:34.292 --> 54:35.292
$15,000!

54:36.292 --> 54:37.327
$20,000!

54:37.375 --> 54:38.239
$20,000!

54:38.292 --> 54:39.372
$100,000!

54:42.458 --> 54:43.823
That's a lot of money!

54:45.125 --> 54:46.365
$100,000!

54:47.083 --> 54:48.323
Anyone else?

54:49.417 --> 54:50.497
Sold!

54:51.250 --> 54:55.163
To this very generous lady, will you
please come and introduce yourself?

55:03.292 --> 55:07.114
I'd like to thank the merchant association
for this opportunity.

55:08.833 --> 55:11.199
On behalf of cheung lok company,

55:11.208 --> 55:15.577
we extend our Sincere wishes to
the victims of the typhoon

55:15.583 --> 55:19.405
and urge everyone here
tonight to give generously.

55:19.417 --> 55:21.032
Cheung lok's a triad gang!

55:22.375 --> 55:24.366
You're using dirty money for charity.

55:24.875 --> 55:26.536
It'll be a curse for the victims.

55:27.208 --> 55:28.823
Doing business with a gangster?

55:29.375 --> 55:31.115
If we let her in,

55:31.125 --> 55:34.697
we'd be condoning their evildoing.

55:35.958 --> 55:39.530
We cannot accept money
from organized crime.

55:39.542 --> 55:41.373
Yes, absolutely...

55:42.167 --> 55:43.782
You... please leave.

55:43.875 --> 55:45.331
You're not welcome here.

55:46.042 --> 55:47.498
Yes, you're not welcome.

55:47.583 --> 55:48.868
Get out...

55:49.417 --> 55:52.329
Please! Everyone. Please calm down!

55:53.875 --> 55:54.875
Miss,

55:55.625 --> 55:57.240
I must apologize,

55:58.708 --> 56:01.666
but a merchant association
is a collective body,

56:02.125 --> 56:05.242
and I must respect the
wishes of all my members.

56:06.417 --> 56:11.741
Since there is some objection
to your background,

56:12.750 --> 56:15.241
I'm afraid we can only accept
your generosity in spirit.

56:15.708 --> 56:17.118
I do apologize.

56:24.750 --> 56:29.744
I haven't always made an honest living,
I admit that.

56:30.542 --> 56:32.908
But take a good hard look at yourselves.

56:34.833 --> 56:37.540
You are not so different, you lie,

56:37.875 --> 56:40.457
you cheat, you exploit.

56:41.625 --> 56:43.786
Are you willing to admit that?

56:47.000 --> 56:48.661
I didn't think so.

57:01.625 --> 57:02.740
Excuse us.

57:29.333 --> 57:30.448
Where's it from?

57:30.458 --> 57:31.458
It's...

57:33.333 --> 57:34.243
Speak.

57:34.250 --> 57:38.198
The guy who runs his street,
his name is fat lung.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
Go

57:57.250 --> 57:58.285
In the back!

58:04.958 --> 58:06.118
Wow.

58:08.583 --> 58:11.165
Whoa. Look at that!

58:12.375 --> 58:13.375
Wow brother.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.365
We made a killing

58:15.375 --> 58:18.492
on chiu kam fu's turf!

58:18.917 --> 58:20.327
Amazing!

58:20.333 --> 58:21.448
I must hand it to you.

58:21.458 --> 58:22.538
You've got nerve!

58:22.875 --> 58:24.661
Chiu kam fu is nothing.

58:24.958 --> 58:26.914
He's no tiger, just a sick kitty.

58:26.917 --> 58:27.952
Exactly!

58:29.500 --> 58:30.740
Take this!

58:34.542 --> 58:35.873
Unload this!

59:31.792 --> 59:33.373
Tso sai kit is peddling drugs.

59:35.417 --> 59:36.953
You must tell your brother.

59:37.458 --> 59:38.914
This will be tricky.

59:39.458 --> 59:41.540
He's indebted to his sister.

59:41.833 --> 59:44.370
I'm afraid there's nothing he can do.

59:47.708 --> 59:49.039
This is the last one.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.082
Mr. Davidson! Hi!

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:22.289
Here I am!

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:25.035
Mr. Davidson,

01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:26.407
nice to meet you.

01:00:29.333 --> 01:00:31.494
He is my buddy.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.367
Kit is the boss of cheung lok,

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:37.332
a big, big gang in Hong Kong.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:40.825
With him on board, we make money more...

01:00:42.417 --> 01:00:44.248
You take a look!

01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:49.873
Triple!

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:57.872
I only work with the best people.

01:00:59.792 --> 01:01:01.407
There's only one steak.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.740
Who's eating?

01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:08.955
Boss,

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.615
don't play me!

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:14.579
This steak is huge.

01:01:14.958 --> 01:01:17.290
We can... we can share.

01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:22.490
What are you doing?

01:01:24.042 --> 01:01:26.242
You think it's the first time
I've had a gun to my head?

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:28.953
Your bullets are for
target practice, asshole!

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:30.539
Just like you said.

01:01:31.083 --> 01:01:34.041
Every shot must have its purpose.

01:01:34.667 --> 01:01:37.989
This shot is worth everything.

01:01:46.417 --> 01:01:48.578
I guess your sister is right.

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:52.994
You're nothing but a loser.

01:02:01.917 --> 01:02:05.364
If you kill me, it will be your loss.

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:06.535
Really?

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:12.956
So many people could take your place.

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:30.367
I admire you. People like you
are destined for great things.

01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:36.656
I would have worked with you
even if you hadn't killed him.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.741
Sit, eat.

01:03:19.333 --> 01:03:20.493
Cheung tin chi.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.832
What do you think of my calligraphy?

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:27.448
"Martial arts is the righteous path"

01:03:27.583 --> 01:03:29.164
you train your mind with martial arts.

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:31.869
But you're not calm.

01:03:32.833 --> 01:03:34.824
You have not practised in a while.

01:03:36.042 --> 01:03:37.157
Over the years,

01:03:37.167 --> 01:03:39.203
I've looked after the business.

01:03:39.208 --> 01:03:41.745
My hands, held a saber

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:43.081
and they were stained with blood.

01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:45.824
It's been a while since I used a brush.

01:03:46.792 --> 01:03:49.283
And now, that I want to straight.

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:52.204
I realized that doing the right thing
is even more difficult.

01:03:52.208 --> 01:03:55.280
Taking your father's place as a woman

01:03:55.292 --> 01:03:56.702
couldn't have been easy.

01:03:57.458 --> 01:03:59.164
But with determination,

01:03:59.167 --> 01:04:00.748
anything is possible.

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:04.368
I underestimated you by thinking
you're only a good martial artist.

01:04:05.583 --> 01:04:07.539
I'm sure you didn't stop by today

01:04:07.542 --> 01:04:09.578
just to have a chat

01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:15.790
tso sai kit's dealing drugs on bar street.

01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:19.244
What will you do about it?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.206
I want you to stop him.

01:04:23.208 --> 01:04:26.325
It's not that simple. Let me deal with him.

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:28.373
I will need some time.

01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:29.375
Fine.

01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:31.623
I will wait.

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.081
Let me help you.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.865
My old drug addiction.

01:05:09.083 --> 01:05:10.994
Left me with all these problems.

01:05:11.458 --> 01:05:13.915
I know that it wasn't
easy to kick the habit.

01:05:14.292 --> 01:05:15.702
Take it one day at a time.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:20.115
Even though I can stand the cravings,

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.581
I'm afraid someday,

01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:25.787
I'll be tempted by it again.

01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:28.036
We're just like sister.

01:05:28.042 --> 01:05:29.907
Through thick and thin.

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:32.286
You know that we'll manage.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.786
You must have faith in yourself.

01:05:47.125 --> 01:05:48.080
Waiter,

01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:49.368
another?

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:51.373
Make it a double!

01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:52.993
Hey! Excuse me!

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Check please!

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:57.660
Thank you, boss!

01:05:57.667 --> 01:06:00.033
Good... one more...

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:02.539
I can't...

01:06:03.375 --> 01:06:04.785
I really can't.

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:11.536
Good... that's my girl! One more?

01:06:47.458 --> 01:06:49.039
Hey boss! She stole from us!

01:06:49.042 --> 01:06:51.158
Kit I didn't... I didn't steal anything!

01:06:55.083 --> 01:06:57.074
How dare you try and steal from me.

01:06:57.333 --> 01:06:59.198
I didn't... I didn't steal from you

01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:00.288
I didn't steal from you.

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:04.206
What's your hurry?

01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:05.788
You going to report me?

01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:07.623
No! I wouldn't... I wouldn't dare

01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:09.240
I wouldn't dare... I don't know anything

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.956
I don't know...

01:07:12.667 --> 01:07:13.952
Good girl!

01:07:14.917 --> 01:07:16.999
You deserve a nice reward don't you?

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:18.410
Give me a bag.

01:07:41.417 --> 01:07:43.157
Fu will make you pay for this!

01:07:43.167 --> 01:07:45.749
I'm tso sai kit! I'm not
scared of that fool!

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:46.785
Grab her!

01:07:57.375 --> 01:07:59.331
So you mean you haven't
been here in 2 months?

01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:00.118
Yeah, that's right!

01:08:00.125 --> 01:08:02.286
Hey! Where's Nana?

01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.039
Ok, I'll find her.

01:08:21.707 --> 01:08:25.154
Hey! Have a drink lady! Come on!

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:10.779
Nana. Nana!

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:13.743
I didn't take the drugs.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.740
I really...

01:09:17.207 --> 01:09:18.287
I know.

01:09:19.375 --> 01:09:20.865
I know, Nana.

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:23.368
Nana...

01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:24.993
Anyone there?!

01:09:25.875 --> 01:09:27.411
Please help me!

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:40.620
That is the wrong move.

01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:46.287
No sis. It was the right move.

01:09:48.792 --> 01:09:50.372
Each time you screwed up,

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:53.242
father made you kneel right in here
in this room all night,

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:54.740
to reflect.

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:58.288
Every time, I'd sneak in here
and played Chinese checkers with you.

01:09:58.292 --> 01:09:59.748
To keep you company.

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.115
Remember that?

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:03.456
Sure I do.

01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:05.452
Actually,

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:07.832
I really hate Chinese checkers.

01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:12.411
Because they remind me,

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:14.999
of my mistakes and punishment.

01:10:15.583 --> 01:10:16.583
So?

01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:18.740
Did you ask me here

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:20.661
to punish me again?

01:10:22.167 --> 01:10:24.408
Everything I do is for your own good.

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:27.411
You used to listen to me.

01:10:27.792 --> 01:10:29.578
Why have we drifted apart so much?

01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:31.494
Because I listened to you!

01:10:31.917 --> 01:10:33.578
So everyone looked down on me.

01:10:34.792 --> 01:10:35.907
To them,

01:10:35.917 --> 01:10:37.202
I'm just your kid brother.

01:10:37.208 --> 01:10:38.744
They don't even know my name

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.661
is tso sai kit.

01:10:42.083 --> 01:10:43.118
But,

01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:44.740
starting today,

01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:47.289
I don't need you.

01:10:48.667 --> 01:10:49.702
Get in here!

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:10.452
Sai kit,

01:11:10.792 --> 01:11:13.499
drugs are out of your league.
You can't handle it.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.535
Give it up!

01:11:14.958 --> 01:11:16.289
But this path.

01:11:16.708 --> 01:11:18.824
Is what I have chosen.

01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:30.456
Tso sai kit!

01:11:30.458 --> 01:11:31.243
Come out!

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:32.365
Kill him!

01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:28.702
You get him!

01:12:48.125 --> 01:12:49.125
Leave!

01:13:19.083 --> 01:13:20.448
You promised to give me time.

01:13:20.458 --> 01:13:21.573
It's too late.

01:13:21.792 --> 01:13:24.329
Drugs are already killing
people on bar street.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.080
Step aside sister!

01:15:37.625 --> 01:15:38.239
Sai kit!

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:39.250
Come on!

01:15:40.458 --> 01:15:41.664
Your kung fu is useless!

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:43.248
Fight my gun with your fist!

01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:46.414
Come get me!

01:16:09.083 --> 01:16:10.163
His arm

01:16:10.625 --> 01:16:12.832
is a peace offering.

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:16.667
Miss kwan!

01:16:16.958 --> 01:16:18.368
An arm can't make up for a life!

01:16:18.375 --> 01:16:19.535
If you don't drop the matter.

01:16:19.917 --> 01:16:22.283
I'll raze bar street to the ground.

01:16:24.292 --> 01:16:25.532
We won't take his life.

01:16:25.958 --> 01:16:27.414
But what about the drugs?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.331
We must settle this.

01:16:30.792 --> 01:16:32.783
Where are the drugs hidden?

01:16:47.625 --> 01:16:49.581
There's no going back after this.

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.330
Any regrets?

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.491
I gave up martial arts to open a bar.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.741
So I could live a quiet life.

01:17:03.542 --> 01:17:05.658
I always remind myself,

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:08.989
to exercise restraint.

01:17:13.792 --> 01:17:15.623
But after all these years,

01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:18.162
trouble still comes knocking.

01:17:18.792 --> 01:17:20.407
I once thought that

01:17:21.458 --> 01:17:24.040
my martial arts could make me famous.

01:17:25.375 --> 01:17:28.037
I even used it to make a living
as a fighter for hire.

01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:30.328
But I really just wanted a simple life.

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:33.909
I thought I could put
martial arts behind me.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:38.740
But deep down,

01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:41.573
I know I never could.

01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:46.331
Those of us who fight

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.867
never understood the true
meaning of martial arts.

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:53.786
You challenged ip man.

01:17:53.792 --> 01:17:55.953
You sure know the true
meaning of martial arts.

01:17:55.958 --> 01:17:57.243
Cheung tin chi,

01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:58.535
I think you're pretty good.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.457
I fought ip man. Behind closed doors.

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:08.573
I lost.

01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:12.365
How'd you lose?

01:18:13.417 --> 01:18:14.577
By just one move.

01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:17.120
By one move? And you gave it all up?

01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:19.118
Do you realize

01:18:19.125 --> 01:18:21.537
that martial arts, isn't about winning?

01:18:21.542 --> 01:18:23.533
Then why did you make
me fight you last time?

01:18:23.542 --> 01:18:25.203
Because I needed to teach you manners.

01:18:25.417 --> 01:18:27.408
I wanted to punch you for ages!

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.207
All of Hong Kong have heard about this now.

01:18:36.875 --> 01:18:39.082
I've been ordered to
clamp down on narcotics.

01:18:40.208 --> 01:18:41.948
I can't protect you anymore.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.331
For the time being,

01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:46.119
take your merchandise elsewhere.

01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:47.535
Lay low for a bit.

01:18:47.542 --> 01:18:50.830
Hong Kong is ruled by the British empire.

01:18:51.917 --> 01:18:56.456
Can't have a Chinese hero running around.

01:18:58.125 --> 01:19:00.286
Today is one person, tomorrow...

01:19:00.292 --> 01:19:02.203
An entire uprising.

01:19:03.042 --> 01:19:04.998
How will you keep order?

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.206
How will I do business?

01:19:08.958 --> 01:19:12.450
Now, anyone who raises a fuss,

01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:14.198
you do what I pay you for.

01:19:16.292 --> 01:19:17.292
Cheers!

01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:32.786
Quick! Move it!

01:19:32.792 --> 01:19:35.158
Get in! Police check!

01:19:35.167 --> 01:19:35.952
Turn off the music.

01:19:35.958 --> 01:19:37.494
Men on one side, women on the other.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.831
Over there!

01:19:40.667 --> 01:19:41.998
You, move it!

01:19:43.167 --> 01:19:44.828
Over there, quick!

01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:47.493
Over there!

01:19:53.333 --> 01:19:54.994
We received a tip.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.456
Someone here is dealing drugs.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.868
We need to search the bar.

01:19:57.875 --> 01:19:58.875
Quiet!

01:20:00.125 --> 01:20:01.410
Quiet!

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:05.333
Fai sir,

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:07.411
I run a legitimate business.

01:20:07.417 --> 01:20:08.998
Is this necessary?

01:20:10.208 --> 01:20:11.869
The gweilo's in charge.

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:12.990
This isn't a joke.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.490
Just cooperate.

01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:35.457
Sir, heroin!

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:40.164
Asshole!

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:42.035
You set me up!

01:20:42.042 --> 01:20:44.454
He's been implicated in
the dealing of narcotics.

01:20:44.583 --> 01:20:45.663
Arrest him.

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:47.365
Take him away.

01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:51.824
He said you're dealing drugs.
And to arrest you.

01:20:51.875 --> 01:20:52.875
Take him away!

01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:55.160
Stay where you are.

01:20:55.167 --> 01:20:56.657
Fu...

01:20:56.667 --> 01:20:57.622
Don't move!

01:20:57.625 --> 01:21:00.367
If you give us trouble!
We'll arrest everyone!

01:21:06.625 --> 01:21:08.240
God damn police!

01:21:12.792 --> 01:21:13.702
Tin chi...

01:21:13.708 --> 01:21:14.788
Don't move!

01:21:18.458 --> 01:21:19.743
Police?

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:21.542
Right?

01:21:23.583 --> 01:21:25.790
You called arson an accident.

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:28.241
Someone was murdered in gold bar.
You did nothing.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.786
You let the real drug dealers go free

01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:31.077
and planted evidence to
frame an innocent man.

01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:32.789
What kind of police is that?

01:21:32.917 --> 01:21:34.578
I don't know anything about a set up.

01:21:35.083 --> 01:21:36.289
We do our job

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:37.498
and follow orders.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.161
You can't tell right from wrong!

01:21:44.042 --> 01:21:46.328
Where's your conscience?

01:21:50.417 --> 01:21:51.873
I have nothing to hide

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:53.411
and a clear conscience.

01:21:53.833 --> 01:21:55.448
He's caught red-handed,

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:57.289
why can't we arrest him?

01:21:58.792 --> 01:21:59.827
Stop!

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:01.956
I'm the owner of gold bar.

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:03.494
I don't need you to get involved.

01:22:04.417 --> 01:22:05.623
Whatever happens,

01:22:05.625 --> 01:22:06.956
I take responsibility.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:10.914
Don't make trouble.

01:22:15.167 --> 01:22:17.829
Let him go. He wouldn't sell drugs!

01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:18.833
Don't worry.

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:21.579
I'll be home for breakfast.

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.207
Nothing to see. Step back!

01:22:34.208 --> 01:22:35.323
Put him in the car.

01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:38.291
You two, take your teams
and search the other bars.

01:22:41.667 --> 01:22:43.032
Yes, sir!

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:44.202
Yes, sir!

01:22:50.042 --> 01:22:52.784
Nothing to see. Just go back inside.

01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:55.324
Nothing to see! Leave!

01:22:55.333 --> 01:22:56.333
Move!

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.662
Enjoy yourself, I will wait outside.

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:03.285
It was you the generous - philanthropist!

01:24:04.625 --> 01:24:06.991
Let it sit for 5 minutes,

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:10.489
and it will be perfect.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.410
Ready to eat.

01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:17.824
I prefer my fried beef and tomatoes.

01:24:17.833 --> 01:24:19.448
Who wants your bloody steak?

01:24:20.250 --> 01:24:22.241
But you should enjoy your last meal.

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:26.830
And if I want you to eat, you will eat.

01:24:27.417 --> 01:24:29.248
Chinese don't have options.

01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:31.832
Every person has the right to choose.

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.575
I chose to open a bar and
you chose to sell drugs.

01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:35.625
Right?

01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:39.617
And you choose to stick your nose
into others people's business.

01:24:40.083 --> 01:24:41.573
You chose wrong.

01:24:42.292 --> 01:24:44.032
And now you have to die.

01:24:45.542 --> 01:24:46.998
My mistake was

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.572
I just found out that
you're a son of a bitch!

01:26:32.875 --> 01:26:35.457
The steak would have been perfect by now.

01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:37.664
And you wasted it.

01:27:03.208 --> 01:27:04.368
The police said.

01:27:04.583 --> 01:27:07.780
Fu tried to escape from custody

01:27:07.792 --> 01:27:09.953
and was killed when he fell down a cliff.

01:27:12.208 --> 01:27:14.073
I don't believe it...

01:27:55.625 --> 01:27:56.455
Miss kwan,

01:27:56.458 --> 01:27:57.743
the car is ready.

01:28:01.167 --> 01:28:03.203
I have somewhere to go first.

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:23.081
You can't go.

01:28:27.708 --> 01:28:28.948
Get out of my way.

01:28:35.208 --> 01:28:36.664
Nana is dead.

01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:40.039
My brother is dead.

01:28:41.875 --> 01:28:44.036
But that foreigner is alive and well.

01:28:44.792 --> 01:28:46.748
The police know everything

01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:49.991
and yet they did nothing at all!

01:28:52.042 --> 01:28:53.998
They won't do anything!

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.956
You don't need to do anything.

01:29:01.958 --> 01:29:03.698
I will do it for you.

01:29:06.958 --> 01:29:08.038
Papa,

01:29:09.792 --> 01:29:11.657
you have to come back.

01:29:20.042 --> 01:29:21.077
Fung,

01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:23.740
there is something,

01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:26.241
papa has to take care of.

01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:32.740
But I promise,

01:29:34.542 --> 01:29:36.078
I'll come back soon.

01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:39.285
Papa,

01:29:39.292 --> 01:29:41.749
I want congee and fried
breadsticks tomorrow.

01:30:05.875 --> 01:30:07.035
Wait here.

01:31:01.833 --> 01:31:03.619
After we leave Hong Kong,

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:05.411
we'll start over.

01:31:47.667 --> 01:31:48.667
Hey!

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:54.535
Mr. cheung?

01:31:57.208 --> 01:31:58.539
How can I help you?

01:32:00.208 --> 01:32:01.243
You forgot this.

01:32:06.833 --> 01:32:10.746
Don't make crazy accusations,
that's not mine.

01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:12.081
What about this?

01:32:28.583 --> 01:32:32.622
So what now, Mr. cheung?

01:34:08.833 --> 01:34:10.448
I can fix it.

01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:12.991
You Chinese think too highly of yourself.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.161
Always wanting to be the hero.

01:34:17.042 --> 01:34:19.033
Hasn't anyone told you.

01:34:19.042 --> 01:34:20.907
That heroes die quickly?

01:34:28.167 --> 01:34:29.373
I'm sorry!

01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:31.456
Papa is going to be fine.

01:34:31.875 --> 01:34:33.365
Because he's my black bat.

01:34:33.375 --> 01:34:35.115
He'll defeat the bad guys.

01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:37.286
Because he's the best.

01:34:49.667 --> 01:34:51.749
I didn't come here to be a hero.

01:35:06.917 --> 01:35:08.532
I came here to beat you.

01:35:18.792 --> 01:35:19.907
Wing chun,

01:35:20.417 --> 01:35:21.702
cheung tin chi.

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.956
Move! Step aside!

01:37:52.542 --> 01:37:53.542
What's this?

01:37:54.042 --> 01:37:55.452
Who's making a scene?

01:37:55.458 --> 01:37:56.458
Leave!

01:38:01.583 --> 01:38:03.323
Leave! There's nothing more to see

01:38:16.833 --> 01:38:20.030
He has assaulted this person
and damaged his property.

01:38:20.042 --> 01:38:21.122
Arrest him.

01:38:25.083 --> 01:38:27.870
We're charging you for assault

01:38:27.875 --> 01:38:28.990
and damaging property.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.240
You're under arrest.

01:38:34.958 --> 01:38:36.823
He's the head of a drug ring.

01:38:37.708 --> 01:38:39.869
His car is in the back, loaded with drugs.

01:38:40.458 --> 01:38:41.789
He's the one you should arrest,

01:38:42.292 --> 01:38:43.327
not me.

01:38:43.958 --> 01:38:46.870
I only see that you've
intentionally attacked him

01:38:46.875 --> 01:38:48.240
and are trying to frame him.

01:38:48.792 --> 01:38:49.998
He said

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.831
you not only assaulted this person,

01:38:51.833 --> 01:38:53.164
but framed him.

01:38:53.167 --> 01:38:54.282
We must arrest you.

01:38:54.292 --> 01:38:55.292
Cuff him!

01:38:57.125 --> 01:38:58.456
This is outrageous!

01:38:58.958 --> 01:39:01.916
They were both fighting,
why only arrest one?

01:39:02.333 --> 01:39:04.039
Why don't you arrest the drug dealer?

01:39:04.042 --> 01:39:05.657
Did he pay you?

01:39:09.708 --> 01:39:11.869
I don't know what you are talking about.

01:39:11.875 --> 01:39:13.661
I'm just here to keep the peace.

01:39:14.125 --> 01:39:16.491
You're all accused of an illegal assembly

01:39:16.708 --> 01:39:18.539
and disrupting public order.

01:39:18.792 --> 01:39:21.204
Go home now! There's nothing more to see.

01:39:22.042 --> 01:39:23.703
I'll arrest you all.

01:39:23.792 --> 01:39:26.864
You...

01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:29.706
Beat them up!

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.410
Beat those dogs!

01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:10.706
In the car behind the restaurant.

01:40:10.875 --> 01:40:12.115
We found all these drugs!

01:40:12.125 --> 01:40:13.535
We have witnesses and evidence.

01:40:13.542 --> 01:40:15.078
He's a drug dealer!

01:40:16.875 --> 01:40:19.161
What are you doing?

01:40:19.167 --> 01:40:21.032
I'm being a policeman.

01:40:21.042 --> 01:40:22.782
You covered up for him.

01:40:22.792 --> 01:40:24.077
Arrest him!

01:40:28.083 --> 01:40:30.039
Even you want to cover for him?

01:40:35.958 --> 01:40:37.289
Take your hands off of me!

01:40:37.708 --> 01:40:39.073
I'm your commanding officer.

01:40:39.083 --> 01:40:42.575
Good, that's right...

01:40:45.792 --> 01:40:47.532
You haven't got the authority to do this!

01:40:47.542 --> 01:40:48.577
Let go of me!

01:40:48.583 --> 01:40:49.698
Take him! Yes sir!

01:40:49.708 --> 01:40:51.619
I'll speak to the commissioner.

01:40:58.792 --> 01:41:00.908
He's getting away!

01:42:02.250 --> 01:42:03.581
Papa,

01:44:12.125 --> 01:44:14.616
Bullying people again?

01:44:16.792 --> 01:44:18.999
What? You want more?

01:44:34.458 --> 01:44:37.530
I told you my papa is the
master of wing chun.

01:44:38.833 --> 01:44:39.948
We should learn wing chun.

01:44:39.958 --> 01:44:41.494
Yes. Wing chun is awesome.
