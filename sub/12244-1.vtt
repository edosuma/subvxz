WEBVTT

00:05.104 --> 00:06.438
Five continents.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.007
12 countries.

00:08.074 --> 00:09.508
19 cities.

00:09.576 --> 00:10.976
50,000 miles.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.044
Five characters.

00:12.112 --> 00:13.312
One dead terrorist.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.380
We're all over the map.

00:14.876 --> 00:19.345
Jeff Dunham
All Over The Map

00:22.255 --> 00:23.055
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

00:23.073 --> 00:26.058
I just completed the longest
and biggest tour I've ever been on

00:26.126 --> 00:28.427
And I couldn't have done
it without my wife Audrey,

00:28.495 --> 00:31.263
who's travelled everywhere, or
without my friend Jeff Rothpan,

00:31.331 --> 00:34.566
who's never travelled further
than his own mailbox.

00:34.634 --> 00:37.069
Was I little concerned about
doing shows in the Far East,

00:37.137 --> 00:38.804
and Africa, and the Middle East?

00:38.872 --> 00:39.588
No..

00:40.000 --> 00:41.240
I was a lot concerned.

00:41.908 --> 00:46.779
But the adventures
all began in Iceland.

01:00.146 --> 01:01.947
Walter, I'm just impressed
that all these folks

01:02.075 --> 01:03.281
came out for our show tonight?

01:03.349 --> 01:04.149
-Well, don't be?
Why?

01:04.284 --> 01:05.284
-Well, it's Iceland.

01:05.351 --> 01:06.401
It's not you or us.

01:06.419 --> 01:08.153
There's nothing else to do here.

01:08.421 --> 01:10.423
[Laughter]

01:10.623 --> 01:13.023
I know you read up on Iceland
a little bit before we came back

01:13.025 --> 01:13.823
Oh Yeah. Yeah.

01:13.824 --> 01:14.823
What did you read about?

01:14.875 --> 01:16.753
Well, I read...
The volcanoes..

01:16.953 --> 01:19.553
You read about that?
Oh yeah it's great..

01:20.353 --> 01:22.856
Imagine something that
can erupt at any second

01:22.858 --> 01:25.816
and destroy everything in its path

01:26.016 --> 01:26.626
Yup..

01:26.816 --> 01:28.049
I'll be darn
Why?

01:28.050 --> 01:30.199
I married a volcano

01:38.263 --> 01:40.464
-You know that Iceland has
one of the highest life

01:40.532 --> 01:42.866
expectancies in
the entire world?

01:42.934 --> 01:43.867
-I did not know that.

01:43.935 --> 01:44.735
-Especially women.

01:44.803 --> 01:45.269
-Yeah?

01:45.337 --> 01:46.670
-Yeah, here a woman's
average lifespan

01:46.738 --> 01:48.539
is 90 to 100 years.

01:51.810 --> 01:55.544
-Send my wife home immediately.

01:57.248 --> 01:57.981
What is this?

01:58.049 --> 01:58.715
Hell on earth?

02:02.019 --> 02:03.754
All right.
-How do you like the food here?

02:03.822 --> 02:06.590
-Oh, very funny.
What?

02:06.658 --> 02:08.859
I tried some of that--
what do you called that?

02:08.887 --> 02:11.628
Hakharl hacaral hakaral.

02:14.666 --> 02:17.164
You cannot speak Icelandic
without moving your lips,

02:17.171 --> 02:18.134
I'm telling you.

02:21.372 --> 02:22.039
Think of that.

02:22.047 --> 02:25.408
There's no Icelandic
ventriloquist ever.

02:28.346 --> 02:32.116
I will say, though, I think the thieves
uh.. folks of Iceland are geniuses.

02:32.183 --> 02:32.817
-How's that?

02:33.024 --> 02:34.451
-They know how to
keep it from getting

02:34.519 --> 02:36.120
overcrowded with foreigners.

02:36.187 --> 02:37.187
-How's that?

02:37.255 --> 02:38.933
-Simply by naming the place..

02:38.943 --> 02:41.458
Iceland.

02:41.526 --> 02:44.928
It sounds like you'll
freeze your ass off.

02:44.996 --> 02:46.575
Plus it's easier to say than

02:46.600 --> 02:51.768
"The dark long winter land
where the weather is Shit."

02:51.836 --> 02:55.572
We're morons for naming our
country the United States.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.307
Sounds way too welcoming.

02:57.375 --> 02:58.882
We should've called our country:

02:58.892 --> 03:00.082
"Crazy Assholes with guns."

03:00.645 --> 03:02.045
[Laughter]

03:02.113 --> 03:04.581
[Applause]

03:04.649 --> 03:06.617
Did you get a chance
to go to a volcano?

03:06.684 --> 03:07.851
Oh, yes I did.

03:07.919 --> 03:08.685
Did you take your wife?

03:08.753 --> 03:09.486
Yes, I did.

03:09.554 --> 03:10.421
What'd she think?

03:10.488 --> 03:12.556
She kept saying the
same thing over and over.

03:12.624 --> 03:13.357
What?

03:13.424 --> 03:15.092
Stop trying to push me in.

03:18.022 --> 03:21.102
On another subject did you know
that strip clubs are also illegal here?

03:21.122 --> 03:22.442
Really?
Right..

03:22.642 --> 03:24.078
So if I wanna see a naked woman

03:24.080 --> 03:27.278
I'd have to a six hour flight to
Scotland?

03:28.258 --> 03:29.778
Or, There is your wife

03:29.978 --> 03:32.078
Oh that's true. In Iceland its
legal to ...

03:32.092 --> 03:33.178
Whale hunt

03:35.678 --> 03:37.866
That's not nice

03:49.216 --> 03:52.409
So I do an interview with the
Nancy Grace of Iceland

03:52.429 --> 03:54.509
Tough penetrating questions.

03:59.009 --> 04:02.509
How do we face criticism?
We don't care..

04:05.009 --> 04:08.509
Good thing we had to hold our own
microphone. This place is on a budget

04:12.009 --> 04:15.127
Look I don't wanna start a riot
or anything but I want all the..

04:15.137 --> 04:17.084
Hot Icelandic women to know..

04:17.293 --> 04:19.284
I'm easy..

04:21.384 --> 04:22.405
The only problem is

04:22.605 --> 04:24.505
Jeff will have to come along too

04:27.005 --> 04:28.257
I'm.. I'm happily married

04:28.457 --> 04:29.457
Not my problem

04:31.429 --> 04:34.865
-Did you know that every
single city in Iceland

04:34.932 --> 04:37.300
is named after the
sound a cat makes

04:37.368 --> 04:38.602
when throwing up a hair ball?

04:38.669 --> 04:41.972
[Laughter]

04:44.942 --> 04:45.709
I learned that.

04:45.777 --> 04:46.743
-That's not true.

04:46.811 --> 04:47.544
-Oh?

04:47.612 --> 04:49.979
Reygoovableh.

04:50.046 --> 04:52.349
[Laughter]

04:52.416 --> 04:53.083
There it is.

04:56.483 --> 04:59.373
My favourite person in Iceland is a guy
named Half Thor..

04:59.473 --> 05:00.759
He should be called whole Thor..

05:00.789 --> 05:03.379
because he won strongest man
in Iceland and in Europe..

05:03.579 --> 05:05.279
I didn't test him but I believed him

05:05.479 --> 05:07.829
Was little awkward walking
around with the guy because he

05:07.839 --> 05:09.560
Pulls trucks and I...

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
Have Dolls..

05:14.060 --> 05:15.261
Game Of Thrones
Right?

05:15.461 --> 05:17.311
Yes..
So who do you play in Game Of Thrones?

05:17.511 --> 05:19.841
uh.. The Mountain
The Mountain?

05:20.041 --> 05:21.781
In... in the season.. four.

05:21.981 --> 05:23.154
Well that make sense it wouldn't be good

05:23.164 --> 05:25.654
If you were like the stick
So you the Mountain..

05:25.754 --> 05:29.026
And You are a Viking
I'm a ventriloquist so...

05:29.926 --> 05:31.926
We have nothing in common
No not really..

05:33.126 --> 05:34.826
How far can you actually throw me?

05:36.026 --> 05:38.516
Probably throw to water over there
You wanna try?

05:38.520 --> 05:40.216
No. I don't wanna try

05:40.416 --> 05:41.816
What do you think about Iceland?

05:42.016 --> 05:44.076
uh..
Do they have beer?

05:44.276 --> 05:47.276
Yeah..
My favourite place ever

05:48.754 --> 05:50.021
You know.. Even though it's
named Iceland, did you

05:50.088 --> 05:52.590
know the winters here
are actually fairly mild?

05:52.658 --> 05:53.357
-No.

05:53.425 --> 05:54.358
-Mm-hm.

05:54.426 --> 05:56.560
-Oh.

05:56.628 --> 05:59.062
Guess they should
have called it Chile.

05:59.130 --> 06:01.299
[Laughter]

06:05.899 --> 06:08.199
That's a joke Half Thor

06:10.799 --> 06:14.799
If you eat too much will you be
three quarters Thor?

06:19.799 --> 06:22.999
I did a fraction.
That was good..

06:24.934 --> 06:27.236
-Have you seen the colors
of the Icelandic flag?

06:27.304 --> 06:29.071
-Uh, no, I haven't seen it.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.773
-There's red for
the volcanic fires.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.207
-Oh, that's good.

06:32.275 --> 06:33.676
-Blue for the mountains
in the distance.

06:33.743 --> 06:34.476
-Yeah.

06:34.544 --> 06:35.144
-And white--

06:35.211 --> 06:36.011
-For the people.

06:36.079 --> 06:38.182
[Laughter]

06:38.482 --> 06:40.462
So have you enjoyed being here in Iceland?

06:40.662 --> 06:42.754
I hate the Volcanoes

06:42.954 --> 06:43.433
Why?

06:43.453 --> 06:46.933
Things blowing up naturally..

06:47.733 --> 06:51.433
If this gets popular I'll
be out of a job.

06:51.933 --> 06:56.193
If one goes off while I'm here
I'm taking credit for it

06:56.593 --> 06:58.763
See that pile of smoke and ash?

06:58.780 --> 07:00.163
I did that..

07:00.963 --> 07:03.063
Tada...

07:04.963 --> 07:30.263
[Yodelling]

07:32.530 --> 07:35.732
-OK, did you know that they have
the oldest tree in Norway

07:35.800 --> 07:36.933
right here in Bergen.

07:36.991 --> 07:38.367
-Fascinating.

07:41.539 --> 07:44.574
If I want to see some old
wood, I'll take a Viagra.

07:44.841 --> 07:46.543
[Laughter]

07:46.611 --> 07:47.511
Thank you.

07:47.578 --> 07:49.880
Thank you.

07:49.947 --> 07:50.781
Thank you.

07:54.318 --> 07:57.721
-Did you know the first ever
ski jumper was from Norway?

07:57.789 --> 08:00.056
-Let me guess,
married and miserable?

08:03.027 --> 08:04.494
-So you've never
been snow skiing?

08:04.562 --> 08:06.063
-Actually, yes, once.

08:06.130 --> 08:07.164
Broke a leg.

08:07.231 --> 08:09.182
-Oh, I bet that hurt.

08:09.199 --> 08:09.332
-I don't know.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.802
Wasn't my leg.

08:12.302 --> 08:14.988
Norway is all about water

08:15.188 --> 08:16.935
I found a sea captain who agreed to

08:16.945 --> 08:19.435
Help me with the severalties of the language

08:25.535 --> 08:27.876
Can you teach me to say..

08:28.076 --> 08:28.976
Um...

08:29.176 --> 08:30.776
I can't find my room

08:38.275 --> 08:38.976
OK. Forget it

08:39.976 --> 08:43.076
Did you know Norway is a
constitutional Monarchy.

08:43.275 --> 08:44.275
Oh yeah yeah..

08:44.476 --> 08:48.076
It means they have a king..

08:48.276 --> 08:49.276
So its true?

08:49.876 --> 08:51.876
Elvis is alive..

08:53.376 --> 08:54.476
No

08:56.776 --> 09:01.016
Another thing you know you better not
get caught driving drunk

09:01.216 --> 09:02.216
Why?

09:02.416 --> 09:05.216
Well if you caught you have
to spend 30 days in jail

09:06.216 --> 09:08.196
They suspend your license
oh yeah yeah..

09:08.896 --> 09:12.169
And then they fine you 10%
of your annual income..

09:14.019 --> 09:17.869
So that would be 12 dollars..

09:19.069 --> 09:22.639
-Do you know where I can buy
some whiskey around here?

09:22.706 --> 09:24.440
-Well, in Norway you
can only buy liquor

09:24.508 --> 09:27.777
from special stores
called, uh, good god.

09:27.845 --> 09:30.880
[Laughter]

09:30.948 --> 09:35.351
Vin-- how do you say it?

09:35.419 --> 09:36.085
Yeah, that.

09:38.989 --> 09:43.960
-There are none-- nur
none hur dun nur dun.

09:44.260 --> 09:46.640
So do you know about
the midnight sun?

09:46.940 --> 09:51.114
The midnight sun.
Is that Norway's Batman?

09:57.714 --> 09:59.522
No in the summer some parts of Norway

09:59.532 --> 10:01.722
get 24 hours of sunlight..

10:04.622 --> 10:06.232
What?

10:06.992 --> 10:09.364
They have 24 hours of sunlight

10:09.374 --> 10:12.564
Well, That's almost a whole day

10:14.028 --> 10:15.895
-So we've done a lot
of interesting things

10:15.963 --> 10:17.163
while in Norway.

10:17.231 --> 10:19.332
Yeah, This morning I milked a goat.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.733
-Oh?

10:20.801 --> 10:23.536
-Achmed got mad at me.

10:23.604 --> 10:26.571
I think I was
touching his chick.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.513
On another subject I was taking about.

10:31.523 --> 10:34.243
with the Walter that Norwegians
invented skiing.

10:34.245 --> 10:37.643
Oh... really?
Yeah. In Norwegian the word ski

10:37.843 --> 10:40.850
Means piece of wood
Oh..yeah yeah.. piece of wood

10:41.050 --> 10:43.540
Can I speak a Norwegian?
Sure...

10:43.740 --> 10:44.875
Oh Kay.. ummm

10:44.885 --> 10:46.675
That hot lady in the front row

10:46.875 --> 10:49.875
Is giving me a big ski

10:52.075 --> 10:55.958
Heard something else interesting..
Did you know Norway sends Sweden its garbage

10:56.158 --> 10:59.558
To use in its recycling programs

11:01.258 --> 11:04.018
A lot of countries import other
country's garbage..

11:04.918 --> 11:08.108
Canada gave us Justin Beiber.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.579
I was telling one of the other guy

11:15.779 --> 11:17.407
As you know Norway means path to the North

11:17.417 --> 11:19.637
That's interesting cos where we are from

11:19.687 --> 11:23.556
Mexico means:
"Pack your bags and start running north"

11:26.556 --> 11:27.756
All right..

11:33.956 --> 11:35.685
Silence, I kill you..

11:36.425 --> 11:37.725
-So while we're here.

11:37.793 --> 11:39.327
-Wait, I want to
ask you something.

11:39.395 --> 11:40.161
Can we go to Ikea?

11:42.932 --> 11:43.698
-This is Norway.

11:43.766 --> 11:44.732
Ikea is in Sweden.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.067
-Oh, too bad.

11:46.135 --> 11:48.970
I wanted to give Ikea a
new advertising slogan.

11:49.038 --> 11:49.915
-And what's that?

11:49.955 --> 11:52.039
-I-Kea Al-you.

11:52.106 --> 11:55.910
[Laughter]

12:00.950 --> 12:04.018
-So Achmed, did you know the
biathlon is popular here?

12:04.086 --> 12:05.787
-What is this biathlon?

12:05.855 --> 12:07.355
It's where you ski
and shoot a gun.

12:07.423 --> 12:08.922
-Oh! Yes, of course.

12:09.091 --> 12:13.862
But in Los Angeles, you
drive and shoot a gun.

12:13.929 --> 12:15.930
-I also learned today that
the Vikings put their dead

12:15.998 --> 12:17.232
on a boat and sent
them out to sea.

12:17.299 --> 12:18.066
-Yes, of course.

12:18.133 --> 12:20.435
The first Norwegian Cruise Line.

12:20.503 --> 12:23.872
[Laughter]

12:36.572 --> 12:39.269
So we landed in lovely Dublin,
Ireland last night

12:39.289 --> 12:42.069
We landed but none of the baggage did

12:42.269 --> 12:43.969
I got like 29 baggage tags

12:44.009 --> 12:47.929
No clothes, No dummies, No toothbrush,
No Underwear, No nothing

12:48.129 --> 12:52.229
So I'm sure in 8 hours I guess for now
I'm just gonna

12:52.429 --> 12:54.929
walk around and drink Guinness

13:18.290 --> 13:21.192
-So have you learned much about
Ireland since we got here?

13:21.260 --> 13:26.230
Ah I'd say Americans and the
Irish pretty much think alike.

13:26.298 --> 13:27.632
-How's that?

13:27.699 --> 13:31.635
-Most of us think our government
should take flying fucking leap.

13:31.702 --> 13:32.570
[Laughter]

13:32.638 --> 13:36.340
[Applause]

13:39.377 --> 13:42.647
-Well, besides politics, did
you know that Bram Stoker who

13:42.714 --> 13:44.715
wrote ah.. created
Dracula is from Dublin?

13:44.783 --> 13:45.550
-Oh really?

13:45.617 --> 13:48.686
No, I heard..
Dracula , yeah..

13:48.754 --> 13:50.154
Dracula?

13:50.222 --> 13:52.923
You mean the guy who sleeps
all day, goes out every night,

13:53.091 --> 13:54.491
And can't stop drinking?

13:54.559 --> 13:56.227
[Laughter]

13:56.295 --> 13:59.497
[Applause]

14:01.133 --> 14:05.803
Wonder where Stoker
got that idea?

14:05.871 --> 14:08.872
I once picked up an
Irish hitch hiker.

14:08.874 --> 14:09.503
-You did?
-Yeah.

14:09.508 --> 14:10.107
-Where was he going?

14:10.675 --> 14:11.242
-Rehab.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.276
[Laughter]

14:12.344 --> 14:13.412
[Applause]

14:13.512 --> 14:16.092
Have you noticed this is very diverse city?

14:16.392 --> 14:20.492
Yes, Yes.
I saw the black guy.

14:27.922 --> 14:30.392
Good for you

14:32.692 --> 14:35.142
Did you see the O'Connell bridge?
No what's that?

14:35.152 --> 14:38.742
It's the only bridge in Europe that's
as wide as as it is long..

14:38.782 --> 14:39.342
Oh..

14:39.392 --> 14:41.542
I married her

14:47.242 --> 14:49.162
Is it a toll bridge?

14:50.262 --> 14:51.362
No..
Oh..

14:51.562 --> 14:52.862
Well that's another thing my wife

14:52.872 --> 14:54.462
And that bridge have in common

14:54.662 --> 14:55.092
How's that?

14:55.102 --> 14:58.592
No one would ever pay to get on her either

15:02.080 --> 15:04.181
Seems like she is Irish.

15:04.248 --> 15:05.449
[gibberish]

15:05.516 --> 15:09.586
[Laughter]

15:11.589 --> 15:15.460
[gibberish]

15:16.397 --> 15:17.361
-You're not saying anything.

15:17.389 --> 15:19.096
-No, but they can understand me.

15:19.163 --> 15:20.330
[Laughter]

15:20.398 --> 15:24.801
[Applause]

15:24.869 --> 15:26.603
-So what do you think
about Dublin so far?

15:26.671 --> 15:30.507
-Oh, duh, dur, uh, this
is the land of beer.

15:30.575 --> 15:31.508
-That's right.

15:31.576 --> 15:34.011
-I know we're going
to Israel soon,

15:34.078 --> 15:36.313
but while we've
been here in Dublin,

15:36.381 --> 15:39.149
I've seen pubs
everywhere, so I'm

15:39.217 --> 15:41.618
pretty sure this is the Holy Land.

15:41.686 --> 15:43.520
[Laughter]

15:43.588 --> 15:46.790
[Applause]

15:51.262 --> 15:54.464
And this is the biggest
alcoholics anonymous meeting

15:54.532 --> 15:55.665
I've ever been to.

15:59.404 --> 16:00.670
-I have a joke.

16:00.738 --> 16:01.972
-All right.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.474
-What do you call
women in Ireland?

16:04.542 --> 16:05.442
-I don't know.

16:05.510 --> 16:06.877
What do you call
women in Ireland?

16:06.944 --> 16:08.812
-You call them women,
you chauvinist bastard.

16:12.550 --> 16:15.619
-We landed in Belfast the
other day, and I'm like what?

16:15.686 --> 16:16.486
Belfast?

16:16.554 --> 16:18.088

16:18.156 --> 16:20.824
[Laughter]

16:20.892 --> 16:23.794
[Applause]

16:23.861 --> 16:25.996
I love Dublin.

16:26.064 --> 16:29.099
I would never do
anything evil to Dublin.

16:29.167 --> 16:30.033
-Really?

16:30.101 --> 16:32.035
-I'm afraid of the soccer fans.

16:32.103 --> 16:35.539
[Laughter]

16:35.606 --> 16:37.874
But have you looked
at this audience?

16:37.942 --> 16:38.842
-Yes.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.178
-Closely.

16:41.245 --> 16:42.279
When the lights are out?

16:42.346 --> 16:42.747
-Yes.

16:42.814 --> 16:46.283
-I am made entirely
out of bone and teeth,

16:46.350 --> 16:48.318
and my color actually blends in.

16:48.386 --> 16:50.220
[Laughter]

16:50.288 --> 16:54.057
[Applause]

16:54.125 --> 16:56.159
-All right, Achmed, look, as
everybody was coming tonight,

16:56.227 --> 16:58.128
they were given an opportunity
or two to ask you a question.

16:58.196 --> 16:59.463
-Yes.

16:59.530 --> 17:02.079
-And everybody wrote them
down, and before the show

17:02.086 --> 17:04.334
we grabbed a handful, and I
think you should answer them?

17:04.352 --> 17:05.256
-Okie dokie.

17:05.263 --> 17:08.238
-Dear Achmed, does Guinness

17:08.306 --> 17:10.740
[Laughter]

17:10.808 --> 17:11.675

"Dear Achmed, would you help me
propose to my girlfriend?"

18:02.825 --> 18:04.425
No...

18:06.525 --> 18:08.625
Next question?

18:10.085 --> 18:14.475

18:15.275 --> 18:17.175
House lights

18:19.375 --> 18:20.565
Okay..

Okay. All right. Let's hear it

18:43.007 --> 18:44.527
Yeahhh..

18:46.327 --> 18:50.027
This is the saddest thing I've ever seen

18:51.227 --> 18:53.952
I asked your mommy to marry me

18:54.252 --> 18:57.552
Prompted by a dead terrorist.

18:59.952 --> 19:03.952
If you have kids name the first one Achmed

19:32.530 --> 19:36.700
-Isn't England where
Mary Poppins is from.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.001
-It took place in London.

19:38.069 --> 19:38.902
-Oh yeah, OK.

19:38.970 --> 19:39.470
Yeah.

19:39.577 --> 19:40.937
You know, I dated
her for a while.

19:45.743 --> 19:46.877
-You dated Mary Poppins?

19:46.944 --> 19:47.677
-Yes, I did.

19:47.745 --> 19:48.245
-No.

19:48.312 --> 19:48.945
-Yeah, I did.

19:49.013 --> 19:49.779
We were very young.

19:49.847 --> 19:51.848
-Oh really?

19:51.916 --> 19:55.552
-I was the first guy to get
into her chim chim cher-ee.

19:55.620 --> 19:58.955
[Laughter]

20:01.826 --> 20:04.161
Kinda ruined things when
in the moment of passion

20:04.228 --> 20:06.363
she started screaming
some weird word.

20:06.430 --> 20:11.034
It was like super
California refrigerator

20:11.102 --> 20:12.636
x the delicious lotion.

20:12.703 --> 20:15.605
Something like that.

20:16.355 --> 20:18.735
Pretty kinky chick
I tell you that much

20:19.905 --> 20:22.015
We landed in London its afternoon

20:22.115 --> 20:23.876
Its time for a high tea with four

20:23.886 --> 20:26.676
Very proper English ladies.

20:39.276 --> 20:40.676
Walter do you know why are we here today?

20:40.876 --> 20:42.576
Uh.. Tea

20:43.476 --> 20:45.814
How come nobody is drinking it yet?

20:45.824 --> 20:48.272
Well nobody has been told their mother

20:48.472 --> 20:50.459
You do?... What did you call me?

20:51.529 --> 20:54.059
we hardly ever have men at afternoon tea

20:54.159 --> 20:57.199
We'll go out later. Trust me..
We want fun

21:01.599 --> 21:03.256
So Peanut what has impressed you most

21:03.356 --> 21:04.456
Since we been in England?

21:05.073 --> 21:08.276
-Uh, I love this country
because just about everything

21:08.343 --> 21:10.278
is double entendre.

21:10.645 --> 21:11.078
-Like what?

21:11.146 --> 21:12.046
-Oh, come on.
Even the food

21:12.147 --> 21:13.114
Bangers and mash?

21:13.181 --> 21:15.850
Come on!

21:15.917 --> 21:17.652
-That's sausages and potatoes.

21:17.719 --> 21:21.822
-It sounds more like
a male dance team.

21:21.890 --> 21:24.659
Or two guys dating.

21:25.027 --> 21:29.030
I don't want to be
mash, all right?

21:29.130 --> 21:30.797
Have you seen any one famous since
we have been here?

21:30.807 --> 21:33.337
Yes I actually did. I saw..
Victoria Beckham

21:33.347 --> 21:35.337
You did not.
I did too

21:35.437 --> 21:37.357
I Think, She was facing me

21:37.557 --> 21:40.702
And then when she turns sideways
She disappeared

21:46.097 --> 21:48.826
-Did you know that the very
first x-ray was taken right here

21:48.834 --> 21:51.202
in Birmingham, England in 1896?

21:51.269 --> 21:52.270
-Ha!

21:52.337 --> 21:57.074
You call it an x-ray,
I call it a selfie.

21:57.092 --> 21:58.492
-So what did you do today?

21:58.560 --> 22:02.830
-I saw where they keep all
those useless wax figures.

22:02.898 --> 22:04.165
-Ah, Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.

22:04.233 --> 22:04.966

[Laughter]

22:07.169 --> 22:11.505
[Applause]

22:11.573 --> 22:13.107
-With that in mind,
have you learned

22:13.175 --> 22:14.775
anything since we've been here?

22:14.843 --> 22:17.511
-Uh, I've learned that
the folks in Birmingham

22:17.579 --> 22:20.081
like to be called Brumies.

22:20.148 --> 22:22.516
-Right.

22:22.584 --> 22:24.986
-So I took that knowledge forward.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.054
Unfortunately, the folks in Scotland

22:27.122 --> 22:28.556
do not like to be called Scummies.

22:31.293 --> 22:34.996
Oh, they got all pissed off.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.497
I don't know what the
hell they were saying.

22:36.565 --> 22:38.032
You ever try to talk
to an angry Scot?

25:25.123 --> 25:28.459
-Yeah, do Paul and Ringo
ever get back here,

25:28.527 --> 25:32.430
or are they still trying to
avoid running into Pete Best?

25:32.498 --> 25:35.166
[Laughter]

25:38.137 --> 25:40.738
-For those who might be
watching and not be familiar,

25:40.806 --> 25:42.707
Pete Best was the
original drummer

25:42.775 --> 25:44.175
for The Beatles before--

25:44.243 --> 25:46.211
-Before they dumped
his ass and got Ringo.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.112
-That's right.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.247
-That had to suck.

25:50.915 --> 25:52.283
You think he's over it by now?

25:52.351 --> 25:53.951
-I don't know.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.853
You know they named a
street after Pete Best.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.522
-Oh, well, yes, great.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.291
[Laughter]

26:02.998 --> 26:06.363
That's got to make up for the
millions of dollars and pounds,

26:06.371 --> 26:08.433
don't you think?

26:08.900 --> 26:10.287
What the hell's the
name of the street?

26:10.435 --> 26:11.935
You got screwed boulevard?

26:14.035 --> 26:16.545
Shafted Lane.. I don't kn..

26:17.145 --> 26:19.645
It could have been you road.
I don't know..

26:20.145 --> 26:22.265
You guys have all the crazy tourists

26:22.275 --> 26:24.039
Wanting to see where the Beatles are from

26:24.049 --> 26:25.988
You know we in US we have the same thing

26:25.995 --> 26:29.148
With the Elvis Precley Graceland in Memphis

26:29.150 --> 26:31.948
Yeah.. Oh Yeah..

26:36.348 --> 26:38.208
Graceland that's where Elvis fans flock

26:38.210 --> 26:39.878
To see where Elvis lived

26:40.078 --> 26:42.056
And if you are a Michael Jackson fan you

26:42.066 --> 26:44.095
Can come out to L.A and take a walking tour

26:44.105 --> 26:47.095
Of all his plastic surgeon offices

26:49.295 --> 26:50.655
Quite lovely..

26:51.255 --> 26:53.447
The nose was done here

26:53.947 --> 26:56.587
It fell of here and they redid it here

27:03.887 --> 27:04.995
And you know there's hmm..

27:05.195 --> 27:07.095
More to see here than just the Beatles stuff

27:07.115 --> 27:08.225
Oh yeah?
Yeah

27:08.245 --> 27:13.945
There is the uh,
International Slavery Museum

27:16.045 --> 27:17.978
Oh,

27:19.378 --> 27:23.611
What an uplifting afternoon that should be

27:24.072 --> 27:26.474
-Did you know that it was in
Liverpool that scientists first

27:26.541 --> 27:29.909
discovered that malaria
was spread by mosquitoes?

27:34.249 --> 27:37.818
-That's just fascinating, Jeff.

27:37.886 --> 27:39.487
Let's put that on
the welcome signs.

27:39.554 --> 27:41.289
[Laughter]

27:41.356 --> 27:42.490
That'll bring in the tourists.

27:42.557 --> 27:43.291
Come to Liverpool!

27:43.358 --> 27:46.961
We have Beatles and mosquitoes!

27:47.029 --> 27:50.231
And one of them carries
a deadly disease!

27:50.299 --> 27:52.667
Find out which one!

27:53.434 --> 27:54.901
Ringo?

28:07.201 --> 28:09.507
After touring the Beatles museum in Liverpool

28:09.517 --> 28:11.377
This morning we took a long drive

28:11.397 --> 28:12.442
And we have now reached the

28:12.452 --> 28:16.402
Border between England and Scotland
And here it is right here..

28:20.032 --> 28:23.202
We'll be in Scotland in twenty minutes

28:27.002 --> 28:28.650
How the hell did this happen?

28:28.850 --> 28:31.090
I mean I'm on the other side of the planet

28:31.100 --> 28:32.468
And people know who I am

28:32.478 --> 28:33.788
And they are laughing at my jokes

28:33.790 --> 28:35.958
Who'd think that, that dumb little terrorist

28:35.968 --> 28:37.158
would have brought things this far

28:42.498 --> 28:43.565
-I know a little fact.

28:43.632 --> 28:44.933
Did you know that
people in Scotland

28:45.000 --> 28:47.202
buy 40 bottles of
whiskey every second?

28:50.740 --> 28:52.874
This is my favourite country ever.

28:59.648 --> 29:02.117
Do they NASCAR in the uk?

29:02.184 --> 29:03.351
-In the what?

29:03.419 --> 29:04.219
-In the uk?

29:07.690 --> 29:09.758
-The-- oh, UK.

29:09.825 --> 29:11.038
-Oh..

29:12.594 --> 29:14.194
you can spell.

29:15.931 --> 29:18.566
-But Glasgow is, uh-- you told
me it was confusing for you?

29:18.634 --> 29:19.667
-Yeah, it is.

29:19.675 --> 29:20.522
-Why?

29:20.530 --> 29:22.771
-Yesterday at lunch
my waitress asked me

29:22.838 --> 29:25.507
if I wanted some tatties and neeps.

29:25.574 --> 29:27.242
[Laughter]

29:27.309 --> 29:30.178
When I said yes, instead
of taking off her top,

29:30.246 --> 29:31.413
she brought me food.

29:31.480 --> 29:34.916
[Laughter]

29:34.984 --> 29:38.319
[Applause]

29:39.655 --> 29:43.725
It was the worst strip
club I'd ever been to.

29:43.793 --> 29:45.860
Tatties and neeps are
served with haggis.

29:45.928 --> 29:47.796
Well, she didn't
show me that either.

29:51.296 --> 29:53.199
But next week we are in Australia

29:53.200 --> 29:55.990
So that's when I see
Down Under.

29:56.890 --> 29:59.498
Did you know that golf
was invented in Scotland?

30:00.569 --> 30:02.398
Fascinating

30:04.008 --> 30:05.464
You know what else was invented here?

30:05.466 --> 30:09.164
What?
Being in public and yelling, Shit..

30:12.064 --> 30:13.861
Wait, we might use that on a DvD

30:13.871 --> 30:16.231
And they are not gonna let us say shit.

30:16.881 --> 30:19.071
Take two..
Yeah..

30:19.871 --> 30:20.971
You wanna do do the joke again?

30:20.981 --> 30:21.999
Yeah what the hell, why not

30:22.009 --> 30:24.639
It's good joke. They laughed
I don't know...

30:25.566 --> 30:27.839
I can do that. All right here we go..

30:28.839 --> 30:31.207
Take two assholes

30:32.207 --> 30:33.870
You talking about the..you know..

30:34.070 --> 30:35.446
The way they speak?

30:35.450 --> 30:37.183
Ok now look we are in their country
yeah?

30:37.283 --> 30:40.093
They speak normally

30:43.893 --> 30:45.503
I know some Scottish..

30:46.503 --> 30:49.403
Really? oh yeah, I learned it
OK ready I watched the videos

30:49.410 --> 30:50.503
It's like this..

30:50.523 --> 30:53.283
I Can't do it captain

30:58.003 --> 31:00.142
How about the Lockness Monster?
How is that?

31:00.152 --> 31:01.299
Well, Do you believe in a

31:01.300 --> 31:03.714
mysterious creature that lives in
the murky depths and

31:03.720 --> 31:05.153
Breathes fire?

31:05.353 --> 31:08.623
Believe in it, I married its sister.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.433
A lot of famous actors are Scottish

31:12.435 --> 31:12.884
Like who?

31:12.885 --> 31:15.408
Sean Connery, Ewin McGrager, Gerarld Butler

31:15.410 --> 31:17.868
What about Benedict Cumberbatch?

31:19.008 --> 31:21.081
No no.. He is a famous actor
but he is British

31:21.085 --> 31:23.931
I know, I just like saying Cumberbatch

31:24.331 --> 31:25.942
Hey babe, I'll show you my benedict

31:25.950 --> 31:29.004
If you show me your cumberbatch

31:30.766 --> 31:32.066
We've been talking
about Scotland a bit.

31:32.134 --> 31:33.468
Oh yes?

31:33.536 --> 31:36.438
-I read the other day that
Scotland is actually the-- I've

31:36.505 --> 31:38.940
saved this fact for you--
the murder capital of Europe.

31:39.008 --> 31:41.843
[gasp]

31:42.411 --> 31:43.316
-I didn't do it!

31:43.328 --> 31:46.614
I have nothing to
do with this shit!

31:46.982 --> 31:48.883
Did you know that
bagpipes have existed

31:48.951 --> 31:50.885
in Scotland since
the 14th century?

31:50.953 --> 31:51.887
-Oh!

31:51.954 --> 31:55.323
That is probably about the
time the murder rate went up.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.561
[bagpipe noises]

32:03.113 --> 32:05.425
Ha ha ha ha

32:07.403 --> 32:10.347
Did you know that I think
my mother was part Scottish?

32:10.459 --> 32:10.572
-Yeah?

32:10.639 --> 32:11.630
Why do you say that?

32:11.637 --> 32:14.242
-Sometimes she'd want to
put me in Scottish clothing?

32:14.310 --> 32:15.076
-Really?

32:15.144 --> 32:17.312
-Sure, she'd say I kilt you.

32:17.379 --> 32:18.179
[Laughter]

32:18.247 --> 32:19.080
Kilt?

32:19.148 --> 32:19.481
Kilt?

32:19.548 --> 32:20.148
Get it?

32:20.216 --> 32:20.949
Kilt?

32:21.016 --> 32:24.552
I kilt you.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.556
[Applause]

32:27.706 --> 32:29.698
Jackie Dawson, Jackie where are you?

32:29.898 --> 32:30.898
<font color=#00FF00>Here</font> (Male)

32:36.798 --> 32:40.008
Jackie lay off the testosterone

32:41.108 --> 32:43.738

32:44.268 --> 32:47.378

everyone around you

32:50.478 --> 32:53.888
Where is Jackie? (Female Voice)
I'm here (Male Voice)

32:56.208 --> 32:57.681
This is why in my country we

32:57.691 --> 32:59.981
Cover our women

33:08.601 --> 33:12.051
Where are you? Mm Mm Marie?

33:12.251 --> 33:15.551
Right I can't roll my arms

33:22.301 --> 33:24.284
Don't worry I got it.
OK.

33:26.484 --> 33:29.814
Last name Christie, Is she here?
Up there

33:30.154 --> 33:33.394
With the guy that sounds like a chick.

33:34.594 --> 33:38.828
She says: Dear Achmed I have a problem
with strange people touching me.

33:39.028 --> 33:40.608
I would love to tell them

33:40.708 --> 33:42.098
I will Keel them

33:42.298 --> 33:45.308
But that can come across as rude

33:45.508 --> 33:47.331
Any other suggestions?

33:48.231 --> 33:49.363
Put your clothes back on

33:49.365 --> 33:51.763
And get off the pole

33:56.663 --> 33:58.063
Dear Achmed can you please wish

33:58.263 --> 33:59.803
Lisa Lamont a Happy Birthday?

33:59.915 --> 34:01.503
Hay Hay, NO

34:04.003 --> 34:08.203
OK OK Lisa happy freaking birthday, Yay

34:08.603 --> 34:10.083
How old are you?

34:10.882 --> 34:12.783
What? What the hell did she say?

34:14.023 --> 34:15.658
How Old?

34:16.898 --> 34:20.784
Oh, yeah OK she is 30th thirty

34:22.585 --> 34:25.076
I gotta practice. Thirty

34:25.275 --> 34:27.275
I'm thirty you dumb fool

34:31.906 --> 34:35.121
A Scottish Dead Terrorist?

34:41.221 --> 34:45.281
That is something I can work on lad

35:04.681 --> 35:06.451
So in middle of the trip we
come to Abu Dhabi

35:06.456 --> 35:07.731
What have we been looking forward to?

35:07.741 --> 35:09.101
Riding Camels

35:09.201 --> 35:10.263
So we got in the car this morning

35:10.283 --> 35:11.673
to come out here and ride the camels

35:11.773 --> 35:12.943
Why not? You have to

35:13.143 --> 35:14.002
But what are the odds

35:14.012 --> 35:15.282
As we were coming here in the car we

35:15.292 --> 35:16.352
Picked up the newspaper

35:16.355 --> 35:18.045
And the front headline says:

35:18.245 --> 35:23.398
"Avoid close contact with camels
Say the Vet experts"

35:23.798 --> 35:25.914
Why?
Because there is a new virus going around

35:26.014 --> 35:29.214
That people can catch and one third
of the people die

35:30.094 --> 35:31.414
Skip the camels

35:33.004 --> 35:35.461
My question is when you sign a little thing

35:35.465 --> 35:38.441
on airplane: "Have you been to any farms?"

35:38.641 --> 35:41.921
Nope. Have not. been to no farms

35:44.532 --> 35:46.967
-By the time I was done,
I was 104 degrees out,

35:47.034 --> 35:48.935
and I was sweating like a pig.

35:49.003 --> 35:51.442
And..

35:54.542 --> 35:55.642
what happened?

35:55.910 --> 35:57.677
What?

35:57.745 --> 36:00.680
Wait a minute-- oh
I can't say pig?

36:00.748 --> 36:01.481
What?

36:01.549 --> 36:02.282
I don't what to say.

36:02.350 --> 36:03.216
I don't-- forget it.

36:03.284 --> 36:04.751
Just-- I don't know anything.

36:04.819 --> 36:07.521
What the ... are
they talking about?

36:08.118 --> 36:09.789
You.. you ,sir No one else talk

36:09.795 --> 36:10.629
What are they saying?

36:10.639 --> 36:13.829
And please use an accent
I can understand

36:17.188 --> 36:17.921
Don't say pig?

36:17.989 --> 36:19.189
Is that it?

36:19.257 --> 36:22.059
OK, I was sweating like a goat.

36:22.127 --> 36:23.193
[Laughter]

36:23.261 --> 36:23.927
All right.

36:32.103 --> 36:32.769
-Holy crap.

36:43.148 --> 36:47.050
You're not gonna, erm--

36:47.118 --> 36:48.285
-What are you trying to say?

36:48.353 --> 36:51.221
-You're not-- [mumbling].

36:51.289 --> 36:52.022
No Achmed.

36:52.090 --> 36:53.390
No Achmed.

36:53.458 --> 36:55.792
[Laughter]

36:55.860 --> 36:58.629
[Applause]

37:04.636 --> 37:08.105
Can you not fucking
see out there?

37:08.173 --> 37:11.241
-I will talk to Achmed
about this later.

37:11.309 --> 37:13.577
-No, no, no.

37:13.645 --> 37:17.214
Can I, uh, get in the box and
get the fuck out first?

37:17.282 --> 37:18.982
[Laughter]

37:19.050 --> 37:22.786
[Applause]

37:22.854 --> 37:26.523
It's not a good idea.

37:26.591 --> 37:27.391
We're not in Israel.

37:27.458 --> 37:28.158
-I know.

37:32.658 --> 37:34.608
Walter, Are you enjoying Abu Dhabi?

37:34.618 --> 37:37.798

38:21.551 --> 38:22.818
[Laughter]

38:22.885 --> 38:24.619
[Applause]

38:24.687 --> 38:27.122
A frickin tent.

38:27.190 --> 38:27.923
-It's a nice--

38:27.990 --> 38:29.491
-Yeah, a nice tent.

38:29.559 --> 38:32.000
Yay.

38:32.028 --> 38:33.128
It's a frickin circus tent.

38:33.196 --> 38:34.896
[Laughter]

38:34.964 --> 38:38.466
All we're missing is
the midget and music.

38:38.534 --> 38:41.169
Here's Jeff and Walter.

38:41.237 --> 38:43.805
[Laughter]

38:45.608 --> 38:48.310
This sucks.

38:48.377 --> 38:49.444
-It's a fine facility.

38:49.512 --> 38:50.278
-OK, all right.

38:50.346 --> 38:52.180
Yeah, yeah.

38:52.248 --> 38:54.149
I guess we're
actually safe though.

38:54.217 --> 38:54.983
-How's that?

38:55.051 --> 38:56.785
-What moron would bomb a tent?

39:01.557 --> 39:02.657
What do you do?

39:02.725 --> 39:04.426
What do you-- cause
$20 worth of damage?

39:07.297 --> 39:09.631
-I don't know who owns
this, but if it's one guy,

39:09.699 --> 39:10.799
he might be here tonight.

39:10.867 --> 39:12.634
-Oh good, he's gonna
go home to his palace,

39:12.702 --> 39:14.202
and here we are in fucking tent.

39:14.270 --> 39:14.936
-All right!

39:22.036 --> 39:23.811
Did you know that over 70%

39:23.821 --> 39:25.371
Of Abu Dhabi is desert?

39:25.381 --> 39:29.551
Again my wife will fit right in
How is that?

39:29.552 --> 39:30.951
She is also dried out

39:30.953 --> 39:34.151
And hostile to all forms of life

39:34.718 --> 39:36.351
That's not nice..

39:36.843 --> 39:39.022
-So Bubba J, do you know
where we are exactly?

39:39.023 --> 39:40.946
-Oh, no. Sure don't..

39:42.214 --> 39:42.880

39:46.485 --> 39:47.151
-What?

39:49.888 --> 39:51.255
-Abu Dhabi.

39:51.323 --> 39:52.256
-You're drunk.

39:52.324 --> 39:54.225
[Laughter]

[Applause]

39:58.964 --> 39:59.764

-Say that again.

40:01.767 --> 40:02.433
-Abu Dhabi.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.171
-I thought that's
what Fred Flintstone

40:07.239 --> 40:08.773
says when he's excited.

40:08.841 --> 40:11.276
[Laughter]

40:11.343 --> 40:14.513

I really want to love me.

40:59.849 --> 41:01.783
Is it the red cape?
is it?...

41:01.851 --> 41:02.918
Something wrong with that?

41:03.186 --> 41:04.186
Did I say ham?

41:04.254 --> 41:06.755
[Laughter]

41:08.158 --> 41:09.992

41:13.897 --> 41:16.732
[Applause]

41:17.834 --> 41:21.136
Is he coming back?

41:21.204 --> 41:23.371
Did he have to go potty?

41:25.275 --> 41:27.276
Do you pick it up
or pull it down?

41:27.343 --> 41:30.179
[Laughter]

41:30.246 --> 41:33.549
[Applause]

41:39.122 --> 41:40.922
Or is there a little flap?

41:47.122 --> 41:48.715
I have no idea we are offending any body

41:48.725 --> 41:50.315
Just Stop!!!

41:51.015 --> 41:53.515
I don't care. I go home in a suit case

41:57.015 --> 41:58.088
You are right I better watch or

41:58.098 --> 42:01.488
You could be going home in a box too

42:03.688 --> 42:05.368
Oh yeah..

42:09.768 --> 42:11.508
You are back..

42:12.408 --> 42:13.964
I was so worried I thought I have said

42:13.965 --> 42:15.378
Something to offend you and you have said:

42:15.380 --> 42:18.218
"Ha enough of here . Goodbye"

42:20.218 --> 42:21.549
A thing or some fucking shoe is

[Laughter]

42:49.642 --> 42:52.878
[Applause]

42:56.883 --> 42:59.017
What the hell?

42:59.085 --> 43:03.021
What-- I threaten to kill
them, they all go yay.

43:03.689 --> 43:05.858
-I think some of them
actually like you here.

43:06.525 --> 43:07.326
-Really?

43:07.393 --> 43:09.628
[Applause]

43:11.731 --> 43:14.766
You know, since being
here, I've been starting

43:14.834 --> 43:17.903
to rethink the whole
suicide bomber thing.

43:17.971 --> 43:19.271
-How's that?

43:19.339 --> 43:22.341
-I blew myself to get a new
place and a few virgins,

43:22.408 --> 43:24.343
meanwhile eight guys
in the front row

43:24.410 --> 43:26.521
here have five mansions each,

43:27.121 --> 43:28.421
a bunch of hot wives,

43:28.615 --> 43:32.117
and their own skin.

43:32.185 --> 43:35.954
I had no idea these
options were available.

43:39.993 --> 43:42.093
I love you guys. Good Night.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.600
-Welcome to Israel!

43:56.800 --> 43:58.167
We are in the heart of the old city

43:58.177 --> 43:59.167
Of Jerusalem

43:59.187 --> 44:00.585
Where Christian, Jews and Muslims

44:00.590 --> 44:01.785
All live together

44:01.905 --> 44:03.314
But no matter what the differences

44:03.324 --> 44:05.298
They all seem to agree on one thing

44:05.498 --> 44:07.498
Satellite TV

44:32.105 --> 44:35.040
[shouts]

44:35.108 --> 44:36.444
[Applause]

44:37.185 --> 44:38.452
-Where the hell are we?

44:38.520 --> 44:40.922
[Laughter]

44:40.989 --> 44:44.325
[Applause]

44:45.960 --> 44:47.207

Shalom.

44:53.735 --> 44:58.273
[Applause]

44:58.463 --> 45:00.358
You know why they call this the holy land?

45:00.368 --> 45:02.855
Of course, Yeah.. Not far from here

45:03.055 --> 45:06.055
Is the birthplace of Soda Stream

45:11.740 --> 45:16.511
I'm surprised at how many
of men here have facial hair.

45:17.279 --> 45:17.645
Well, that's true.

45:17.713 --> 45:19.314
-Yeah, we went to
the market today,

45:19.381 --> 45:22.116
and it took me 10 minutes to
pick my wife out of the crowd.

45:22.184 --> 45:23.618
[Laughter]

45:23.686 --> 45:26.187
[Applause]

45:31.707 --> 45:33.584
I'm at the Caramel Market in Tel Aviv Israel

45:33.594 --> 45:35.837
One of the most famous markets
in the entire world

45:35.847 --> 45:36.762
You are supposed to buy stuff here

45:36.772 --> 45:38.432
But you are supposed to negotiate and haggle

45:38.442 --> 45:39.632
I'm horrible at that

45:39.832 --> 45:42.269
What if I give you ten?
No..

45:42.279 --> 45:43.948
How about ten shackles?
Na.. No No

45:44.148 --> 45:45.337
Could I have gotten it for 30?

45:46.037 --> 45:47.237
Uh.. You could have

45:47.407 --> 45:48.948
15? No No.

45:48.978 --> 45:50.767
All right You told me it was 28

45:50.777 --> 45:52.566
But now that it is open how about ten?

45:52.766 --> 45:54.629
I told you just for you,
Cos its the Wednesday

45:54.639 --> 45:57.169

45:57.869 --> 45:59.559
See, I suck at this..

46:02.059 --> 46:05.359
A guy asked me today if I was Jewish

46:05.559 --> 46:06.438
What did you say?

46:06.448 --> 46:08.818
I said whaa.. I don't know.

46:09.818 --> 46:10.414
Then what happened?

46:10.624 --> 46:13.513
He asked me if I was circumscribed?

46:14.713 --> 46:17.581
Circumcised. He asked you if
you were circumcised

46:17.590 --> 46:18.781
ay ay.. OK. All right

46:19.481 --> 46:21.327
It's the act of circumcision

46:22.316 --> 46:24.855
Ah.. Well, I have a television..

46:27.292 --> 46:28.948
Do you know what circumcision is?

46:29.148 --> 46:30.848
I don't know.. what is circumcision..

46:44.248 --> 46:46.968
Please put me back in the suit case

46:50.255 --> 46:52.537
-So Achmed, we've been
going all over the place.

46:52.540 --> 46:53.023
-We have.

46:53.091 --> 46:53.700
-You know where we are?

46:53.802 --> 46:56.727

places I have lost track.

46:56.795 --> 47:01.932

47:02.000 --> 47:03.067
What's with all the Jews?

47:07.072 --> 47:08.739

47:08.807 --> 47:09.573

47:19.584 --> 47:21.352
[whimper]

47:23.888 --> 47:26.056
-As in Israeli Army?

47:26.124 --> 47:27.858
[Laughter]

47:27.926 --> 47:30.227
Holy crap.

47:30.295 --> 47:31.996
Well, I'm already dead.

47:32.063 --> 47:34.465
What the hell?

47:34.532 --> 47:38.168
[Applause]

47:38.836 --> 47:39.558
-Achmed, trust me.

47:39.570 --> 47:40.158
You'll be fine.

47:40.168 --> 47:40.938
We're guests.

47:41.006 --> 47:44.408
-So they are friendly Jews?

47:44.476 --> 47:45.276
-Absolutely.

47:45.343 --> 47:46.477
-Do they bite?

47:46.544 --> 47:48.178
[Laughter]

47:48.246 --> 47:49.613
Can I play with one?

47:49.681 --> 47:51.015
[Laughter]

47:51.283 --> 47:54.179
I actually studied about
Israel before we got here.

47:54.188 --> 47:54.485
-Really?

47:54.552 --> 47:55.053
-Yes.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.288
This is where the letter
[guttural noise] comes from.

47:57.355 --> 47:59.690
[Laughter]

47:59.758 --> 48:03.460
[Applause]

48:06.631 --> 48:11.298
A-C-phlegm.

48:11.369 --> 48:14.405
You guys know this stuff.

48:14.472 --> 48:17.308
[Applause]

48:17.375 --> 48:20.110
Why do these folks cheer for me?

48:20.178 --> 48:21.478

Jews run the banks.

48:34.392 --> 48:36.126
Well, I say good.

48:36.194 --> 48:38.428
The Palestinians only
have the West Bank,

48:38.430 --> 48:41.332
and that hasn't gone so well.

48:41.399 --> 48:44.735
[Applause]

48:47.335 --> 48:50.403

-You guys have been awesome!

50:41.840 --> 50:43.207
Thanks for coming out!

51:10.207 --> 51:11.485
Have you learned anything interesting

51:11.495 --> 51:13.133
From visiting our country and

51:13.143 --> 51:15.254
Do you use any of these bits
in your comedy shows?

51:15.264 --> 51:17.136
We did the thing called
"Walking With The Lions"

51:17.146 --> 51:18.390
We went out there and actually

51:18.400 --> 51:20.415
Full grown lions, we are
actually walking with them.

51:20.425 --> 51:21.289
While the guy that works there

51:21.290 --> 51:23.400
Throws them pieces of chicken
to keep them busy

51:23.600 --> 51:25.600
And if he runs out of chicken
You are screwed.

51:26.118 --> 51:30.086
[Applause]

51:30.754 --> 51:34.090

South Africa so far?

51:34.158 --> 51:34.891
-Honestly?

51:34.959 --> 51:35.692
-Yeah.

51:35.759 --> 51:38.294
-Not what I thought it would be.

51:38.362 --> 51:38.695
-How's that?

51:38.863 --> 51:42.298
-Look out there.

51:42.366 --> 51:43.733
We're in Africa, right?

51:46.670 --> 51:48.972
Lot of white folks out there.

51:51.942 --> 51:54.711
[Applause]

51:57.381 --> 51:58.648
-It is South Africa.

51:58.716 --> 52:00.883
-OK.

52:00.951 --> 52:04.821
But it's the continent of Africa.

52:04.888 --> 52:10.293
Well this is not what I
remember from the Tarzan movies.

52:10.361 --> 52:12.395
What is your first name?

52:12.613 --> 52:13.363
David?

52:13.430 --> 52:17.400
And guys named David and Warren.

52:17.468 --> 52:19.435
I don't think those
are African names.

52:19.503 --> 52:22.472
[Laughter]

52:22.539 --> 52:24.674
I was expecting like
[click click whistle].

52:24.742 --> 52:26.943
[Laughter]

52:32.443 --> 52:34.545
Hey David what do you do for living?

52:35.324 --> 52:36.499
Signage?

52:36.599 --> 52:39.089
What do you mean signage?
You put up signs?

52:39.289 --> 52:42.079
That's exciting David

52:44.479 --> 52:46.379
Like, STOP.

52:48.589 --> 52:49.990
Shit there's been an accident here?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.890
Well, where is the fuckin sign?
David..

52:55.290 --> 52:56.521
You not the asshole putting all the

52:56.531 --> 52:58.957
Political signs around town?
Are ya?

52:59.957 --> 53:02.237
This is the guy. Right here

53:08.437 --> 53:09.737
Did you know the one of biggest problems

53:09.747 --> 53:11.811
Of South Africa is poaching of rhinos

53:11.991 --> 53:13.975
Oh, Yes, I have heard this

53:14.375 --> 53:16.567
It is mainly for the rhino horn

53:16.767 --> 53:17.767
That's right.. Yes

53:17.967 --> 53:19.098
Did you know that you really don't get

53:19.100 --> 53:21.014
in trouble here if you kill a poacher?

53:21.024 --> 53:21.914
Really? Right.

53:21.924 --> 53:23.540
So you can kill poachers?

53:23.740 --> 53:24.740
You can hunt them

53:25.440 --> 53:26.100
That's right

53:26.110 --> 53:27.323
Well, that's what I have heard.

53:27.523 --> 53:29.657
OK. But it'll be weird having a trophy

53:29.667 --> 53:30.948
On your wall of a stuffed guy

53:30.950 --> 53:32.148
Named Gary.

53:34.011 --> 53:36.078
-You know, Bubba J,
Jo'burg is a lively city.

53:36.146 --> 53:37.847
-Oh yeah, unless you get shot.

53:40.284 --> 53:41.751
-Did you know that
South Africa has

53:41.768 --> 53:44.120
the largest brewery
in the world?

53:44.187 --> 53:46.088
[gasp]

53:46.156 --> 53:49.058
[Applause]

53:49.126 --> 53:50.826
-The largest brewery?

53:53.897 --> 53:57.066
I'm going to write a letter.

53:57.134 --> 53:59.243
My dearest wife,

54:00.043 --> 54:03.043
For reasons
you will of course understand,

54:03.206 --> 54:04.974
I am never coming home.

54:05.042 --> 54:08.277
[Laughter]

54:08.345 --> 54:11.147
[Applause]

54:12.749 --> 54:16.585
So after you become a
citizen of the South Africa,

54:16.653 --> 54:20.489
how long does it take for
your skin to turn black?

54:20.557 --> 54:23.859
[Laughter]

54:27.931 --> 54:30.933
These guys are early
on too, I think.

54:31.001 --> 54:32.735
[Applause]

54:35.835 --> 54:37.880
Okatol is a place you can see lions

54:38.080 --> 54:43.789
Scary Lions, Bad ass Lions
Very Very close up..

54:45.389 --> 54:48.493
So I'm sitting amongst ten lion cubs

54:48.503 --> 54:49.993
That are just on the verge of

54:50.193 --> 54:51.593
Being unbelievably dangerous

54:51.793 --> 54:53.080
And I been told not to bother them

54:53.090 --> 54:54.188
While they are eating or they will

54:54.198 --> 54:55.958
Turn me into part of the meal

54:57.458 --> 54:58.869
You need to come in here

54:59.069 --> 54:59.817
I'm Good.

55:00.017 --> 55:02.347
Na Come on. Trust me it's fine.

55:03.747 --> 55:05.807
So I hand Rothpan a lion

55:06.007 --> 55:07.837
I literally thought that guy was
gonna pass out

55:07.857 --> 55:09.523
I mean he has never held anything

55:09.533 --> 55:10.823
in his hand except maybe

55:11.023 --> 55:14.061
A sandwich and now he has an unhappy lion.

55:14.261 --> 55:17.600
There you go. let me try and kiss you.
It's fantastic

55:17.700 --> 55:21.830
This is very.. relaxing..
Fine.. You doing well

55:23.430 --> 55:25.907
You are good. You are obviously good
with cats. Yeah..

55:26.107 --> 55:29.107
Very Nice.. that's good all right

55:35.607 --> 55:37.226
I know you went on a uh..

55:37.426 --> 55:40.210
Sight seeing bus tour today.
Yes I did.

55:41.394 --> 55:43.090
Six hour bus ride.

55:44.090 --> 55:44.690
What did you see?

55:44.890 --> 55:46.990
One block..

55:49.690 --> 55:51.838
They say JoBerg is known best for its

55:51.840 --> 55:54.949
Cultural diversity.
No it's not..

55:55.449 --> 55:57.449
It's the fuckin traffic.

56:00.249 --> 56:02.092
Maybe traffic would moved around better

56:02.102 --> 56:04.752
If they put up the right signs..

56:06.503 --> 56:08.303
-All right, you guys
have just been great.

56:08.371 --> 56:09.271
What a crowd.

56:09.339 --> 56:10.439
Thank you so much.

56:11.507 --> 56:13.162
All right, let's turn up
the lights real quick.

56:13.163 --> 56:14.027
Can we do the house lights?

56:14.028 --> 56:15.227
Let's do this real quick?

56:15.244 --> 56:16.545
Let's see what this
is gonna look like?

56:16.613 --> 56:17.513
Oh yeah, this'll be great.

56:18.020 --> 56:19.080
Hold on, let me get Achmed.

56:19.088 --> 56:20.135
Hold on a second.

56:21.082 --> 56:21.583
Can you do it sideways?

56:21.850 --> 56:22.601
Is that good?

56:23.819 --> 56:25.386
This way.

56:25.454 --> 56:26.587
-You dumbass idiot, Jeff.

56:50.046 --> 56:52.614
-Have you seen the size of
the bugs in this country?

56:52.681 --> 56:53.448
[Laughter]

56:53.516 --> 56:54.310
-Yeah, there's some big ones.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.117
-There was a beetle
in our hotel room,

56:56.185 --> 56:57.819
and my wife wanted
me to step on it?

56:57.887 --> 56:58.620
-What did you do?

56:58.687 --> 56:59.021
-Nothing.

56:59.089 --> 57:02.123
The damn thing grabbed my wife's
poodle and flew out the window.

57:02.191 --> 57:03.091
[Laughter]

57:03.159 --> 57:05.892
I love this country.

57:08.092 --> 57:10.092
[Mimicking Puppy's Cry]

57:13.452 --> 57:15.382
Bye.. hah hah hah..

57:17.582 --> 57:19.389
I thought that Irish can throw back a few

57:19.400 --> 57:22.661
But you guys are the drinking
champions of the world..

57:27.001 --> 57:31.393
I'm surprised you don't have dead
sharks with alcohol poisoning

57:31.893 --> 57:34.203
After eating your surfers..

57:35.103 --> 57:36.722
Did you know that even though Australia

57:36.732 --> 57:38.881
Had a bit influx of criminals they now

57:38.891 --> 57:40.359
have you know.. only..

57:40.559 --> 57:41.768
I don't know.. one fifth as many

57:41.778 --> 57:43.533
Murders as we do in the US.

57:43.733 --> 57:44.733
Oh yeah?

57:46.133 --> 57:47.741
Does that surprise you?

57:48.441 --> 57:50.164
It doesn't you?
No

57:50.364 --> 57:52.777
You know how much practice it
takes to kill somebody

57:52.787 --> 57:55.327
With the fricking Boomerang

58:00.527 --> 58:02.951
It's like a thousand to one

58:03.451 --> 58:05.721
I know my wife tried..

58:06.721 --> 58:07.950
That poodle flew out the window

58:07.951 --> 58:10.425
And she is like you son of a bitch

58:11.025 --> 58:13.602
What the f.. what the.. Oh

58:17.202 --> 58:19.530
By the way, Are we getting paid
for this gig?

58:20.230 --> 58:23.630
It's not that aborigine border crap. Is it?

58:25.030 --> 58:26.120
What? we are not gonna get like a

58:26.130 --> 58:29.750
Bag full of Kuala poop or something
like that. Are we?

58:29.850 --> 58:33.360
Some feathers and a long ass horn
that plays one note

58:36.060 --> 58:38.230
Thank you for coming

58:48.000 --> 58:50.480
Shut the fuck up..

58:53.030 --> 58:54.130
-So what are the
differences you've

58:54.198 --> 58:57.033
found between Australia
and the United States?

58:57.101 --> 59:00.336
-Well, I think down here
my marriage goes down

59:00.404 --> 59:03.339
the toilet in the other direction.

59:04.639 --> 59:06.902
So Buba J, Have you enjoyed
Australia so far?

59:07.102 --> 59:09.003
Well, Someone told me that tomorrow

59:09.203 --> 59:11.930
We are gonna go to the Oprah's house

59:17.230 --> 59:18.874
You mean, The Sydney Opera House?

59:18.890 --> 59:20.674
Yeah that's it..

59:21.354 --> 59:23.118
It's not Oprah it's Opera

59:23.318 --> 59:26.618
well, Like you said they
talk different here

59:28.333 --> 59:31.078
So, what are the Austrians
do for fun down here?

59:33.378 --> 59:35.697
Australians.. yeah them too

59:36.797 --> 59:38.850
You know in a couple days we will
be heading to New Zealand

59:39.050 --> 59:42.249
Oww. Yeah. I have heard that they have

59:42.250 --> 59:44.421
More sheep than humans there..

59:46.021 --> 59:48.386
Then I guess the country's slogan  should be:

59:48.586 --> 59:52.526
"New Zealand where baaha means No"

59:56.526 --> 59:57.800
You met any bogens?

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.895
What the hell is a bogen?

01:00:02.905 --> 01:00:04.073
A bogen is what they call someone who

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:07.401
Unsophisticated, Uneducated or
not a lot of class

01:00:07.405 --> 01:00:08.514
Ow.. Yes I have..
Who?

01:00:08.515 --> 01:00:09.714
Jeff faa faa

01:00:13.814 --> 01:00:15.226
What have you learned about this country?

01:00:15.326 --> 01:00:17.926
Ah.. I know the Aussies like to party

01:00:18.126 --> 01:00:20.224
I understand there are pretty much no

01:00:20.239 --> 01:00:22.326
Virgins left here

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:26.606
Except for maybe that guy, right there

01:00:27.007 --> 01:00:28.674
Just guessing.

01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:34.143
-Dear Achmed, my dream
was to see you and Jeff.

01:00:34.181 --> 01:00:36.115
I've been waiting
for seven long years,

01:00:36.283 --> 01:00:38.848
so because I've been waiting
so long, could I please

01:00:38.855 --> 01:00:40.119
have a picture with both of you.

01:00:40.187 --> 01:00:41.921
Thanks, Joanne.

01:00:41.988 --> 01:00:42.821
Joanne, where are you?

01:00:42.859 --> 01:00:43.923
Right there?

01:00:44.191 --> 01:00:45.591
-Hehe, no.

01:00:45.659 --> 01:00:48.061
[Laughter]

01:00:49.008 --> 01:00:51.885
Come on, that's fine.
Come up here.

01:00:54.534 --> 01:00:55.834
-OK, where's your camera?

01:00:56.342 --> 01:00:57.393
<font color=#00FF00>-Um, my friend has it.</font>

01:00:57.394 --> 01:00:58.938
-Well, that doesn't
fucking help.

01:00:59.006 --> 01:01:00.873
[Laughter]

01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:03.009
-OK, well take a
picture of the screen.

01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:05.011
[Laughter]

01:01:05.979 --> 01:01:06.379
-Smile.

01:01:06.447 --> 01:01:08.181
Stop looking at me and
rubbing your tits on my back.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:09.615
[Laughter]

01:01:09.683 --> 01:01:13.920
[Applause]

01:01:14.387 --> 01:01:15.603
Because it's not my back.

01:01:15.629 --> 01:01:16.556
It's his hand.

01:01:16.623 --> 01:01:19.692
[Laughter]

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.003
<font color=#00FF00>-Thank you.</font>

01:01:21.061 --> 01:01:21.885
-Actually do it again.

01:01:22.002 --> 01:01:22.495
-No!

01:01:22.563 --> 01:01:23.463
[Laughter]

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:25.364
-I got your back.
All right..

01:01:26.202 --> 01:01:26.832
And her front.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:27.300
-I got it.

01:01:27.367 --> 01:01:29.502
All right Terribly sorry.

01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:31.036
-Your wife is backstage.
[Laughter]

01:01:31.051 --> 01:01:31.504
-I know.

01:01:32.139 --> 01:01:34.207
-He took a feel
with his knuckles.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:35.141
-No, I didn't!

01:01:38.746 --> 01:01:40.146
-Fun coming up here, isn't it?

01:01:40.214 --> 01:01:41.047
[Laughter]

01:01:41.415 --> 01:01:42.327
-You can get closer.

01:01:42.415 --> 01:01:43.849
Just stand right next to Achmed.

01:01:43.997 --> 01:01:47.019
-And don't rub your hoo hooters.

01:01:47.647 --> 01:01:49.755
Do not rub your
hooters on my scapula.

01:01:49.823 --> 01:01:51.958
[Laughter]

01:01:55.562 --> 01:01:58.865
[Applause]

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:02.465
I took a peek.

01:02:02.472 --> 01:02:03.803
-I know.

01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:05.177
-I see for you.

01:02:05.185 --> 01:02:06.471
-Stop it.

01:02:09.343 --> 01:02:10.443
OK, ready?

01:02:10.511 --> 01:02:12.577
We'll smile, whoever
is taking the picture.

01:02:28.796 --> 01:02:30.997
So Walter, what do you
think of Singapore so far?

01:02:31.064 --> 01:02:33.832
-Uh, it's pretty crowded here.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:34.900
-Oh yeah, that's true.

01:02:34.908 --> 01:02:36.863
It's actually the
second most densely

01:02:36.873 --> 01:02:39.020
populated country in the world.

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:39.904
-Oh.

01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:45.211
Well, don't flatter yourself.

01:02:45.279 --> 01:02:47.263
All these folks aren't
here to see you.

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:50.247
There was just no
room for them outside.

01:02:55.047 --> 01:02:56.887
We came all the way from Hollywood

01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:58.568
California to be here

01:02:58.668 --> 01:03:00.280
And did you now what the first place our

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:02.537
Tour guide recommended for us to visit?

01:03:02.937 --> 01:03:05.737
Universal Freakin Studios

01:03:10.837 --> 01:03:14.313
I was like we have that dumbass

01:03:15.351 --> 01:03:17.085
-What do you like
about Singapore so far?

01:03:17.153 --> 01:03:19.955
Well, they have some tough laws.

01:03:20.022 --> 01:03:21.389
-Oh, you heard about that?

01:03:21.457 --> 01:03:22.524
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:22.592 --> 01:03:24.626
Yeah.

01:03:24.694 --> 01:03:26.461
-Did you know you can
get fined or caned

01:03:26.529 --> 01:03:29.731
for not flushing a toilet after using it?

01:03:29.799 --> 01:03:32.100
[Laughter]

01:03:32.168 --> 01:03:35.470
-And who the hell
checks up on that?

01:03:35.538 --> 01:03:37.205
[Laughter]

01:03:37.273 --> 01:03:38.840
What, do you got the shit police?

01:03:38.908 --> 01:03:41.576
[Laughter]

01:03:41.644 --> 01:03:45.614
It's the SSP, the
Singapore shit police.

01:03:45.681 --> 01:03:47.582
[Laughter]

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:50.418
[Applause]

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.921
I am not kidding.

01:03:52.989 --> 01:03:55.190
How the hell do they know?

01:03:55.258 --> 01:03:56.191
[sniff sniff]

01:03:56.259 --> 01:03:57.692
Ah, that guy.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.929
[Laughter]

01:04:00.997 --> 01:04:04.099
Is it a random check?

01:04:04.166 --> 01:04:07.435
Or do they patrol the potties?

01:04:07.503 --> 01:04:10.372
Shit duty.

01:04:10.439 --> 01:04:12.607
Fred, you investigating
that murder today?

01:04:12.675 --> 01:04:15.943
No, I have a tip that we
have a serial non-flusher.

01:04:15.951 --> 01:04:18.079
[Laughter]

01:04:18.879 --> 01:04:20.153
Did you know Singapore's Airport is

01:04:20.155 --> 01:04:22.508
Considered to be nicest in the world?

01:04:22.708 --> 01:04:24.886
Oh really?

01:04:25.686 --> 01:04:28.510
The nicest airport in the world?
That's right.. Yeah

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:29.919
Do they have many other things

01:04:29.925 --> 01:04:31.983
That they say are nicest in the world?

01:04:32.183 --> 01:04:33.383
I.. ab.. I'm not sure..

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:35.903
So when you drive away
from Singapore Airport

01:04:35.923 --> 01:04:39.103
It's all downhill after that?

01:04:41.403 --> 01:04:42.303
No..

01:04:43.503 --> 01:04:45.626
I found out that every male in Singapore

01:04:45.646 --> 01:04:47.199
who is over 18 has been trained on

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.399
How to use a gun

01:04:48.599 --> 01:04:50.163
Oh..
In other words

01:04:50.363 --> 01:04:53.363
You better be funny asshole

01:04:56.149 --> 01:04:58.417
-I heard you say earlier that
in Singapore if you break

01:04:58.485 --> 01:05:01.378
certain laws they
beat you with a stick.

01:05:03.023 --> 01:05:04.590
Well, maybe while
they're here, Jose

01:05:04.658 --> 01:05:06.258
Can pick up a
little extra work.

01:05:06.326 --> 01:05:09.194
[Laughter]

01:05:09.262 --> 01:05:12.798
-So this has been a
fun tour around the--

01:05:12.866 --> 01:05:14.099
where everywhere--
everywhere we went.

01:05:14.167 --> 01:05:15.200
I love Singapore.

01:05:15.268 --> 01:05:17.303
It's my favourite European city.

01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:20.639
[Laughter]

01:05:20.707 --> 01:05:22.139
Do you know they have save water

01:05:22.141 --> 01:05:23.208
campaign here in Singapore?

01:05:23.276 --> 01:05:24.680
-Oh, well I know.

01:05:24.691 --> 01:05:27.112
So today I drank 18 beers instead.

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.580
[Laughter]

01:05:28.748 --> 01:05:30.348
You're welcome.

01:05:34.187 --> 01:05:37.056
So what's different
here than where we live?

01:05:37.123 --> 01:05:40.626
-Well, I think religiously
there a lot more Buddhists here.

01:05:40.694 --> 01:05:43.028
-Buddhists?

01:05:43.096 --> 01:05:44.962
They all wear boots?

01:05:48.334 --> 01:05:50.469
So what do they do?

01:05:50.537 --> 01:05:53.038
-Well, for one they
believe in reincarnation.

01:05:53.106 --> 01:05:55.206
-Re-incarceration?

01:05:55.274 --> 01:05:57.242
[Laughter]

01:05:59.212 --> 01:06:01.313
You get out and suddenly
you're right back in.

01:06:01.381 --> 01:06:04.149
[Laughter]

01:06:04.217 --> 01:06:05.684
-No, reincarnation.

01:06:05.752 --> 01:06:10.389
That you can have entire past
lives you don't even remember.

01:06:10.457 --> 01:06:11.990
That happened to me yesterday.

01:06:11.998 --> 01:06:14.026
[Laughter]

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:17.746
What's your name?

01:06:17.796 --> 01:06:18.946

01:06:21.546 --> 01:06:24.246
I'm sorry, Say it again slower and louder

01:06:24.446 --> 01:06:25.446
<font color=#00FF00>Raniel</font>

01:06:28.846 --> 01:06:31.815
I think I broke my tongue

01:06:36.015 --> 01:06:39.015
Is there an American version of that name?

01:06:40.075 --> 01:06:42.789
Like, Ralph.

01:06:43.889 --> 01:06:44.822
Let's try one more time.

01:06:44.832 --> 01:06:49.372
Say it again.
You watch closely, cos its not me fuckin up

01:06:55.072 --> 01:06:58.273
OK. Say it again.
<font color=#00FF00>Raniel</font>

01:07:03.324 --> 01:07:04.324

"Can I help you with your problem?"

01:07:31.244 --> 01:07:34.954
So, Rinyal what do you..

01:07:41.054 --> 01:07:43.054
Going down hill isn't it?
Yeah..

01:07:43.454 --> 01:07:44.654
So you are on the phone going

01:07:44.664 --> 01:07:45.864
What's wrong with you phone

01:07:45.874 --> 01:07:48.164
I can fuck you up even more.

01:07:50.864 --> 01:07:52.548
Don't tell anyone I'm trying to get

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:54.748
Porn. Can you help me?

01:07:57.048 --> 01:07:59.948
[whip]
Ah, Never mind

01:08:01.148 --> 01:08:03.649
I just got caned.. I know

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:07.904
You need to make a new Singapore dummy

01:08:07.914 --> 01:08:09.354
mm, What is it?

01:08:09.364 --> 01:08:13.454
I want it to be the caning Singapore dummy

01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:15.474
So that way when you say stupid stuff

01:08:15.484 --> 01:08:17.974
It goes [whip sound] across your legs

01:08:18.474 --> 01:08:20.975
And you go ahh ohhh

01:08:21.175 --> 01:08:22.263
And then when you fall down

01:08:22.273 --> 01:08:24.863
Rinyal goes:
"Hello can I help you?"

01:08:30.662 --> 01:08:32.207
You know Singapore is one
of the only country

01:08:32.216 --> 01:08:34.947
Around here that recognizes Israel.

01:08:35.747 --> 01:08:37.636
What the hell does that mean?

01:08:38.037 --> 01:08:40.238
How could you not recognize it?

01:08:40.438 --> 01:08:42.167
It's like eyy..

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:45.368
What that country with all that
Jews over there?

01:08:46.568 --> 01:08:49.667
I have no idea, I don't recognize it.

01:08:52.468 --> 01:08:54.269
Do do the other countries see Israel at

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:55.921
A party they are like, "No..

01:08:56.022 --> 01:08:57.122
I don't think we have met.."

01:08:59.122 --> 01:09:01.636
And where is Buba J's friend uhuhuhuh

01:09:04.136 --> 01:09:06.267
Can you help me call uhruhrh?

01:09:23.872 --> 01:09:26.140
-We had a great show in
Singapore, we're packing up,

01:09:26.207 --> 01:09:29.377
and Marnel, my tour manager
comes in to deliver some news.

01:09:29.444 --> 01:09:31.345
And he's sweating.

01:09:32.412 --> 01:09:33.046
-Hey, what's up?

01:09:33.055 --> 01:09:33.981
-Come in.

01:09:34.049 --> 01:09:37.718
-I've got some
information on Malaysia.

01:09:37.786 --> 01:09:39.448
They're reviewing several options,

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.057
And option A is not going to be--

01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:45.827
-Option A meaning
I can't use Achmed.

01:09:45.894 --> 01:09:49.430
-It hasn't been defined by
the cultural-- what is it?

01:09:49.497 --> 01:09:50.765
The Cultural sensitivity.

01:09:50.832 --> 01:09:51.999
-Hold it.

01:09:52.067 --> 01:09:54.234
You're saying that these
guys-- who are these guys?

01:09:54.303 --> 01:09:56.337
-It's actually one of
their religious leaders

01:09:56.405 --> 01:09:58.806
that they had to fly to
another city to meet with them.

01:09:58.874 --> 01:10:02.276
-I'm telling you I am the
lamb going to slaughter.

01:10:02.344 --> 01:10:03.768
So they'll start
booing, and they're

01:10:03.773 --> 01:10:05.005
not going to be booing me.

01:10:05.047 --> 01:10:08.416
They're going to be booing the
fact that this is happening.

01:10:08.484 --> 01:10:09.884
-They're probably aware
a lot of this stuff.

01:10:09.952 --> 01:10:11.119
They're probably
used to restrictions.

01:10:11.186 --> 01:10:12.353
-No, they're not.

01:10:12.421 --> 01:10:13.888
-They're probably used to
living with [inaudible].

01:10:13.956 --> 01:10:16.491
-We are promoting the show
with Achmed on the poster.

01:10:18.154 --> 01:10:19.157
It's gonna be a challenge because

01:10:19.168 --> 01:10:20.765
Obviously, I have to..

01:10:20.965 --> 01:10:23.196
Leave out, Any references to anything

01:10:23.906 --> 01:10:25.667
even remotely, relating to religion.

01:10:25.677 --> 01:10:27.381
I can't even say the word virgin

01:10:27.391 --> 01:10:29.817
I can't even say the name Achmed

01:10:31.617 --> 01:10:33.197
I mean I could, Of course i could but

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.561
I wanna go home. I don't wanna
stay here and get caned.

01:10:41.831 --> 01:10:44.699
Well, the main concern for
the Malaysian government

01:10:44.767 --> 01:10:49.304
is that an artist is suitable
for the Malaysian culture.

01:10:49.372 --> 01:10:52.413
Achmed is a little bit sensitive
to the Malaysian public.

01:10:52.441 --> 01:10:56.277
We need to be careful
about what we put on stage.

01:10:56.345 --> 01:10:59.914
The final ruling is that
Achmed the dead terrorist

01:10:59.982 --> 01:11:02.150
is not allowed on stage.

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:08.522
Have you learnt anything constructive

01:11:08.524 --> 01:11:10.325
About Malaysia since we been here?

01:11:10.425 --> 01:11:12.233
I did learn on the radio

01:11:12.333 --> 01:11:14.963
You can not talk about politics
religion or sex.

01:11:14.964 --> 01:11:18.223
That's right.
Well, there goes most of our show

01:11:23.423 --> 01:11:25.063
Did you know that Malaysia has been

01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:28.043
Independent now for 47 years..

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.643
Fascinating.

01:11:33.343 --> 01:11:34.798
And the coincidence..
What's that?

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.636
I lost my independency when I

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.036
got married 47 years ago

01:11:41.736 --> 01:11:42.810
Guess what?

01:11:42.823 --> 01:11:44.695
We don't talk about politics

01:11:45.295 --> 01:11:48.595
I lost my religion and there is no sex

01:11:54.489 --> 01:11:55.876
So I'm in the middle of my show

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.557
I look towards the sides of room and

01:11:57.567 --> 01:11:59.372
There is military guys with rifles

01:11:59.472 --> 01:12:01.172
And they don't look happy

01:12:02.562 --> 01:12:04.507
Please don't get me into the trouble

01:12:06.035 --> 01:12:07.707
I don't care

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.387
Keep looking around

01:12:11.215 --> 01:12:13.287
You are surrounded

01:12:15.395 --> 01:12:17.959
Please let me change the subject..

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:20.740

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:26.922

01:13:46.246 --> 01:13:48.757
And you just don't care.

01:13:52.857 --> 01:13:54.023
You gonna tell your professor:

01:13:54.025 --> 01:13:57.223
"But Sir, I was at a puppet show."

01:14:00.223 --> 01:14:02.621
"With my mom"

01:14:05.001 --> 01:14:07.736

She just gonna fuckin tell you what to do

01:14:23.093 --> 01:14:26.068
-After we booked this
show, we were contacted

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:30.470
by the Malaysian ministry of
arts, and history,

01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:33.670
<font color=#00FF00>Boo
</font>And culture

01:14:34.538 --> 01:14:38.808
And they asked me very
nicely and sternly

01:14:38.876 --> 01:14:41.978
to not bring a certain
character to the show tonight.

01:14:42.045 --> 01:14:46.515
[booing]

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:51.020
They even said please do
not even mention his name,

01:14:51.088 --> 01:14:54.090
but I know that you people are
here because you've seen stuff

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:56.959
On YouTube and you're
expecting to see a certain someone.

01:14:57.027 --> 01:15:01.397
<font color=#00FF00>Yeah!!!</font>
[Applause]

01:15:01.465 --> 01:15:05.835
However, I want to respect the
request because I am a guest

01:15:05.903 --> 01:15:08.604
here, but at the same
time you paid your money

01:15:08.672 --> 01:15:11.774
to see what you thought
you were gonna see.

01:15:11.842 --> 01:15:15.344
That certain person is not here.

01:15:15.412 --> 01:15:16.759
However,

01:15:16.959 --> 01:15:18.959
his brother..

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:23.386
[Applause]

01:15:27.457 --> 01:15:30.126
--is here.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:31.761
He is from France.

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:34.630
[Laughter]

01:15:37.301 --> 01:15:40.670
Please help me welcome
Jacques, the French terrorist.

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:44.040
[Applause]

01:15:57.921 --> 01:16:00.022
-Bonjour American pig.

01:16:00.090 --> 01:16:01.891
[Laughter]

01:16:01.959 --> 01:16:03.025
-So you are French?

01:16:03.093 --> 01:16:04.060
-Oui, oui.

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:05.194

01:16:05.262 --> 01:16:06.095

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:07.997

Je m'appelle Jacques.

01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:14.603
[Laughter]

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:16.439

01:16:17.341 --> 01:16:20.543
[Laughter]

01:16:23.513 --> 01:16:26.415
-What are they laughing at?

01:16:26.483 --> 01:16:28.417
My name is Jacques Merde.

01:16:28.485 --> 01:16:30.419
[Laughter]

01:16:30.487 --> 01:16:33.322
[Applause]

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:37.293
I do not understand what
they are laughing at.

01:16:37.361 --> 01:16:38.594
[Laughter]

01:16:38.662 --> 01:16:42.031
-I think Merde is

01:16:47.237 --> 01:16:49.038
[Laughter]

01:16:49.106 --> 01:16:50.639
-Well, despite your name,
you seem like a nice guy.

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:53.041
-You don't know Jacques Shit.

01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:58.914
Wait, that is not funny!

01:16:58.982 --> 01:16:59.782
[Laughter]

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:00.916
-They're laughing.

01:17:00.984 --> 01:17:04.320
-I kill you!

01:17:04.388 --> 01:17:08.224
[Applause]

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.558
-So you're happy to be here?

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:10.359
-No.

01:17:10.427 --> 01:17:11.160
-Why is that?

01:17:11.228 --> 01:17:14.397
-Where are we exactly?

01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:18.267
Do not spit on my face,
you ugly American.

01:17:18.335 --> 01:17:20.069
Where are we exactly?

01:17:20.137 --> 01:17:20.870
-Kuala Lumpur.

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:21.737
-Oh, oui.

01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:24.407
Kuala Lumpur.

01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:25.207
Malaysia.

01:17:25.275 --> 01:17:27.209

01:17:27.277 --> 01:17:29.145
[Laughter]

01:17:29.212 --> 01:17:31.580
[Applause]

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:34.350

01:17:34.618 --> 01:17:35.785
Morning is up.

01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:37.987
Afternoon and evening is up.

01:17:38.055 --> 01:17:39.722
-I don't think the weather
in France is always hot.

01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:41.624
-Eh, eh, eh, eh.

01:17:41.892 --> 01:17:43.392
Do not question, Jacques.

01:17:48.365 --> 01:17:50.015
It's not always hot in France?

01:17:50.023 --> 01:17:50.366
-No.

01:17:50.434 --> 01:17:51.500

[Applause]

01:17:59.076 --> 01:18:01.510
Let's just say for
the sake of the joke,

01:18:01.578 --> 01:18:03.345
France is always
hot, hot, hot,

01:18:03.413 --> 01:18:06.282
hot, hot, like a desert up.

01:18:06.349 --> 01:18:07.283
[Laughter]

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:08.584
Yes, you didn't
know that before?

01:18:08.652 --> 01:18:10.486
Yes There are pyramids, sand.

01:18:10.554 --> 01:18:12.621
[Laughter]

01:18:15.621 --> 01:18:17.121
Silence

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.141
What was that?
I know French

01:18:23.941 --> 01:18:25.441
So, explain what you do for a living?

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:28.091
I am a France terrorist

01:18:28.391 --> 01:18:29.861
A French terrorist?

01:18:38.156 --> 01:18:40.347
Silence.

01:18:43.645 --> 01:18:44.651
I thought French was known

01:18:44.851 --> 01:18:46.747
As the language of love.
Oui, Oui

01:18:46.947 --> 01:18:49.947
I love to blow up shit

01:18:51.389 --> 01:18:52.590
-Let me get something straight.

01:18:52.738 --> 01:18:54.805
You're the brother
of the other guy

01:18:54.873 --> 01:18:55.706
who was supposed to be here.

01:18:58.777 --> 01:19:03.014
-Do not say his name, or we
are both in giant trouble.

01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:06.817
[Laughter]

01:19:09.421 --> 01:19:10.388
Those guys are here.

01:19:16.228 --> 01:19:18.829
-Dear Achmed, what is your
favourite Malaysian food?

01:19:18.897 --> 01:19:23.100

[Laughter]

01:19:50.462 --> 01:19:52.563
-Dear terrorist--

01:19:52.631 --> 01:19:54.498
-That's not what you
said the first time.

01:19:54.566 --> 01:19:56.834
[Laughter]

01:19:56.902 --> 01:19:59.136
When the show is done, run.

01:19:59.204 --> 01:20:02.006
[Laughter]

01:20:02.074 --> 01:20:05.276
[Applause]

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.280
-Someone named Spring.

01:20:09.348 --> 01:20:10.848
Dear terrorist,
if you were given

01:20:10.916 --> 01:20:13.251
the chance again to
be human, would you?

01:20:13.318 --> 01:20:15.453
[gasp]

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:18.456
-I am not human?

01:20:18.523 --> 01:20:19.257
-Not any more.

01:20:19.324 --> 01:20:20.791
-No?

01:20:20.859 --> 01:20:23.294
-Do you know what
that makes you?

01:20:23.362 --> 01:20:24.428
-A politician?

01:20:24.496 --> 01:20:27.298
[Laughter]

01:20:27.366 --> 01:20:30.601
[Applause]

01:20:32.671 --> 01:20:36.907
But the ministry is a
lovely group of people.

01:20:36.975 --> 01:20:38.476
[Laughter]

01:20:38.543 --> 01:20:40.981
-You guys have
been just awesome.

01:20:41.479 --> 01:20:41.879
Thanks KL.

01:20:41.947 --> 01:20:42.880
We'll see you.

01:20:42.948 --> 01:20:43.814
Good night!

01:20:56.962 --> 01:20:58.462
So we've been all over
the globe and I wanted

01:20:58.530 --> 01:21:01.132
to end this special in the place
that's most important to me.

01:21:01.199 --> 01:21:02.099
How could we not?

01:21:02.167 --> 01:21:03.467
It's not a fancy stage.

01:21:03.535 --> 01:21:05.169
In fact, a lot of the audience
is sitting in the mud.

01:21:05.237 --> 01:21:06.003
It's bee raining.

01:21:06.071 --> 01:21:07.104
They're sitting in the grass.

01:21:07.172 --> 01:21:09.573
But here we are in
the land of the free

01:21:09.641 --> 01:21:11.108
and the home of the brave.

01:21:11.876 --> 01:21:15.746
Here we are at Joint
Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.
