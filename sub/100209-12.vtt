WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.785
LAINEY: Back in the '90s,

00:02.828 --> 00:05.353
we were just beginning
to understand
all the amazing things

00:05.396 --> 00:06.832
the Internet could
bring to our lives.

00:06.876 --> 00:09.400
Luckily, William Penn
was led by a brave pioneer

00:09.444 --> 00:11.924
ready to bring his teachers
into the modern age.

00:11.968 --> 00:16.190
Welcome, fellow educators,
to our first staff meeting
in the future!

00:16.233 --> 00:17.756
Oh!
[LAUGHS]

00:17.800 --> 00:19.062
Ooh!
Love it.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.324
We are getting
William Penn Academy

00:20.368 --> 00:22.544
onto the information
superhighway.

00:22.587 --> 00:25.329
And who better to introduce us
to this new computer age

00:25.373 --> 00:27.766
than our own
Jean Taraborelli!

00:27.810 --> 00:28.593
Take it away, Tabs!

00:28.637 --> 00:29.942
[APPLAUSE]

00:29.986 --> 00:31.727
Thank you, John.
Whoo! [LAUGHS]

00:31.770 --> 00:37.994
Okay. Now, imagine
in your mind's eye
the William Penn website!

00:38.038 --> 00:41.911
Oh, yes. Your lives
are about to get easier
and funner!

00:41.954 --> 00:43.478
Funner...
That's what got me.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.741
Ah, now this
whole cockamamie

00:45.784 --> 00:47.873
computer-surfing thing
makes sense.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.572
It's another one of
Taraborelli's wackadoo
schemes.

00:50.615 --> 00:53.531
I'm sorry, do you have
a question, Gym Teacher Rick?

00:53.575 --> 00:55.446
Yeah. Is this gonna be
a total whiff,

00:55.490 --> 00:57.144
like the time
we had spiders

00:57.187 --> 01:00.364
and you forced everybody
to have potted lavender
on their desks?

01:00.408 --> 01:02.671
Lavender oil is a natural
deterrent to the arachnid.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.325
You know what's
an actual deterrent?

01:04.368 --> 01:05.543
An exterminator.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.589
John? I think we strayed
way off topic here.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.939
Also? Maybe you can get them
to stop fighting relentlessly.

01:09.982 --> 01:11.245
No! Their fiery hatred
of each other

01:11.288 --> 01:12.420
is the best part
of these meetings.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.552
No, they're right.
Let's stay on track.

01:14.596 --> 01:17.164
If this lady can't
get rid of actual spider webs,

01:17.207 --> 01:18.513
you really want her
in charge of a web

01:18.556 --> 01:19.905
that covers
the entire world?

01:19.949 --> 01:21.429
I know what I'm doing!
Do you?

01:21.472 --> 01:22.952
Yes!
Actually, I'm with Mellor
on this one.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.388
Wow.
Really? What?

01:24.432 --> 01:25.824
It's right there
in the movie Hackers.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.043
CB's got a point.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.349
I mean, hackers are sexy
but dangerous.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.438
Is it a documentary?
It's even better.

01:30.481 --> 01:33.005
It's like a techno-thrill ride
starring the Fisher Stevens.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.485
I don't know who...
Got it on laserdisc.

01:34.529 --> 01:35.791
It's that good.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.402
LAINEY: Yep.
The movie Hackers
featured the best

01:38.446 --> 01:39.795
that '90s tech thrillers
had to offer...

01:39.838 --> 01:41.840
Roller-blading,
an insane plot line,

01:41.884 --> 01:43.407
and Fisher Stevens
on a skateboard.

01:43.451 --> 01:46.280
See? Those teenagers
hacked the stock market.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.977
And they made it rain
inside the school.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.283
Is this our future, John?

01:49.326 --> 01:51.850
Angelina Jolie
is better than her father.
It is madness!

01:51.894 --> 01:54.418
Well, leave it
to ol' Terrible-elli

01:54.462 --> 01:56.855
to bring this technological
chaos into our lives.

01:56.899 --> 02:00.642
Really? You're gonna
all listen to Gym Teacher Rick
over me?

02:00.685 --> 02:02.426
The man can't even
turn on a computer!

02:02.470 --> 02:03.645
By choice.

02:03.688 --> 02:06.038
I trust that thing
about as far as
I can throw it.

02:06.082 --> 02:07.997
I give you
10 feet at best.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.520
Have you seen my legs?
I throw from my legs.

02:09.564 --> 02:12.044
I guarantee I could chuck this
thing 30 yards...No!

02:44.425 --> 02:46.340
Yeah, I love singing

02:58.352 --> 03:01.616
And isn't that what makes
the song in itself ironic?

Anna's painfully shy,

03:34.518 --> 03:36.303

to her was unreal.

03:36.346 --> 03:37.739
I'm just doing my job.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.697
Well, modesty's appreciated,
but let's be honest here.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.830
When you first
started teaching,
you had your doubts.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.397
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

03:43.440 --> 03:45.964
you've really come

03:58.455 --> 04:00.283
I have been watching
this little drama unfold

04:00.327 --> 04:02.198
between you and Lainey
all year

04:02.242 --> 04:03.460
like it is my own

04:03.504 --> 04:05.070
I know drama teachers
love drama,

04:05.114 --> 04:07.856
but there's absolutely
nothing going on between
Lainey and me.

04:07.899 --> 04:10.511
Probably for the best,
as you clearly have no shot.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.687
CB absolutely has a shot
with Lainey.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.384
Allow me.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.517
That is Barry Goldberg,
Lainey's high-school
sweetheart.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.432
Was he insanely rich
or something?No.

Wait a minute.
Lainey went out with
that Goldberg kid?

04:29.747 --> 04:31.575
In that case,
you definitely do have a shot.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.969
I don't need a shot,
'cause I don't want a shot.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.285
What are we
doing here, John?

04:45.328 --> 04:46.938
Yeah. I usually use
my free period

04:46.982 --> 04:48.505
to pop off
a thousand chin-ups.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.072
This fighting
has to stop.

Is it Liz Flemming?

It's Liz Flemming.
She complains
about everything.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.993
And also, she's spying
on us right now

04:58.036 --> 04:59.473
as she pretends
to make copies.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.039

make copies.

That's what we do.

to be the giraffe,

and bond without knowing it.

out is working together."

one thing to do. [CHUCKLES]

Oh, the drama escalates.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.371

strategy to find her voice.

of the Internet,

a cheap shot.

a secret, okay?

I cannot discuss his e-mail
