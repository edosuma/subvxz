that bought
the sawing in half set?

20:07.806 --> 20:11.243
Because, uh, if so, we can
settle this out of court!

20:12.477 --> 20:14.012
- I couldn't break the oath.

20:14.079 --> 20:17.716
All I could break...
was our friendship!!

20:17.783 --> 20:21.353
- Ohhhh. A friend.
I see...

20:21.420 --> 20:22.521
- [cooing]

20:22.588 --> 20:25.090
{\an1}- I just wanted to do magic
for people...

20:25.157 --> 20:27.259
But then I lost Dade.

20:27.326 --> 20:30.028
I can't be a magician anymore!

20:30.095 --> 20:32.864
I can't handle this burden!

20:32.931 --> 20:34.766
- Oh! No, no! Don't cry!

20:34.833 --> 20:38.971
{\an3}Because there's a strawberry
mint behind your earless head!

20:39.037 --> 20:43.208
{\an3}Oh, actually
this is my dinner.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.677
{\an3}[sighs] It's a shame
you're giving up on magic.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.413
{\an3}There're so many good things
it has to offer!

20:48.480 --> 20:51.249
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's Constance.

20:51.316 --> 20:54.653
We toured the world together.
We were best friends.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.489
She knew where every knife,
nickel, and hanky was stashed.

20:57.556 --> 21:00.025
There was nothing
we didn't share.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.060
{\an1}- You told her
how to do the magic tricks?

21:02.127 --> 21:03.895
But what about the oath?

21:03.962 --> 21:06.331
- Of course I told her.
We were a team!

21:06.398 --> 21:10.268
But she quit to be a standup
comedian slash hand model.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.870
Sure, I was disappointed.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.339
But friends <i> never</i> give up
on each other!

21:14.406 --> 21:17.442
The only thing greater than
magic is friendship.

21:17.509 --> 21:20.779
And to a lesser extent, love.
Which I've never known.

- Thank you! Now,
before we start the show,

21:35.427 --> 21:38.664
I'd like to introduce you
to my new assistant,

21:38.730 --> 21:41.767
the only other soul
who knows my magical secrets!

21:41.833 --> 21:44.903
Please give a warm welcome
to my dear friend,

21:44.970 --> 21:46.905
the righteous Dade!

21:46.972 --> 21:47.973
- Yeah!
- Wow!
