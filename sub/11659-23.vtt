(theme music playing)

00:53.400 --> 00:56.066
(panting)

00:56.133 --> 00:57.400
Blanche, what are you doing?

00:58.066 --> 01:00.800
I'm panting, Dorothy.

01:01.266 --> 01:05.133
Is the U.P.S. man wearing
his tight overalls again?

01:05.734 --> 01:07.066
-Stop my watch.
-Oh.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.834
What is going on?

01:08.900 --> 01:11.400
Why are you guys
on this sudden exercise kick?

01:11.467 --> 01:13.800
The Harland twins
have asked Rose and me

01:13.867 --> 01:15.567
to spend next weekend with them.

01:15.633 --> 01:17.200
Cruising in the Bahamas.

01:17.266 --> 01:19.834
Oh, so you're trying to lose weight.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.633
Oh, more than lose weight.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.834
We're giving ourselves
a total make-over.

01:23.900 --> 01:26.633
I handle fitness, Blanche handles beauty.

01:26.700 --> 01:31.400
Who handles distracting the twins
while you two have your swimsuits on?

01:32.700 --> 01:34.600
(horn honks)

01:34.667 --> 01:38.166
Ah, there's my ride!
I'm off to Epcot.

01:40.066 --> 01:42.367
Wait! Where's your overnight bag?

01:42.433 --> 01:47.633
Who needs a bag? We play cards,
sleep in a motel, then come back.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.834
You go to Epcot
and never look at the exhibits?

01:51.900 --> 01:57.033
Please. I'm 82 years old. I'm interested
in technology of the year 2000?

01:58.133 --> 01:59.500
<i>Hasta luego!</i>

02:00.900 --> 02:03.967
As long as we're resting,
we might as well take measurements.

02:04.033 --> 02:06.367
Do me first.

02:06.433 --> 02:10.333
One thing I know,
I haven't lost my hourglass figure.

02:10.400 --> 02:15.400
Looks like somebody poured about
90 minutes of extra sand in the glass.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.066
(laughs)

02:17.133 --> 02:19.033
You're just jealous of me.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.500
Rose knows it. Don't you, Rose?

02:21.567 --> 02:25.633
It's neat the way the tape's
a different color at this end.

02:28.433 --> 02:32.734
I haven't had this much off the spool
since I measured the couch for slipcovers.

02:34.033 --> 02:35.567
(doorbell rings)

02:36.500 --> 02:38.734
Ma must have forgotten something.

02:41.066 --> 02:42.367
Hi, Ma! Surprise!

02:42.433 --> 02:45.500
Michael! What are you doing here?

02:45.567 --> 02:47.500
Hello there, Michael.

02:47.567 --> 02:51.066
I was with the band
up in Fort Lauderdale.

02:51.133 --> 02:52.133
I thought I'd swing by.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.300
Oh, you missed Sophia. She just left.

02:55.367 --> 02:59.033
She'll be back tomorrow.
Tell me what is new.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.300
To be honest, a lot.

03:01.367 --> 03:02.767
I'm getting married.

03:05.567 --> 03:07.600
Michael, that's wonderful.

03:07.667 --> 03:12.000
Of course. Of course, Michael.
It's wonderful.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.166
It's just, ooh... kind of sudden.

03:14.233 --> 03:16.033
I know it seems sudden.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.734
Lorraine is her name.
She sings with the band.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.734
We've been dating four months,
but I've never been so sure of anything.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.734
Mom, she's the one.

03:26.266 --> 03:27.867
I'm really happy for you.

03:27.934 --> 03:30.567
When do we get to meet Lorraine?

03:30.633 --> 03:33.700
Tomorrow, if that's okay?
I already invited her.

03:33.767 --> 03:34.767
Oh...

03:34.834 --> 03:36.400
She's staying with her family
in Miami beach.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.834
We'll get the families
together Sunday.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.200
I can't wait to meet her.

03:41.266 --> 03:44.133
Before you do, mom,
there's something you should know.

03:44.200 --> 03:48.133
Lorraine is kind of... black.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.633
"Kind of black".

03:54.700 --> 03:56.000
(laughs)

03:56.066 --> 03:59.200
What does that mean, "kind of black"?

03:59.266 --> 04:02.934
That's like being kind of Spanish.
(laughs)

04:03.000 --> 04:05.500
You know,
either you are or you aren't.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.667
-She is.
-Oh, God!

04:10.000 --> 04:13.166
Emilio Estevez is kind of Spanish,
Dorothy.

04:15.533 --> 04:17.567
Thank you, Rose.

04:17.633 --> 04:20.500
Mom, you're not upset about this, are you?

04:20.567 --> 04:22.700
(stammers)
No, I'm not upset.

04:22.767 --> 04:26.734
It's just that it's an awful lot
to digest at once.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.000
I mean, first you surprise me,
then the engagement,

04:30.066 --> 04:32.900
and then... Lorraine.

04:32.967 --> 04:34.667
I really love her, mom.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.033
(chuckles)
Then that's all that matters.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.066
I mean it.

04:41.133 --> 04:43.100
I'm very happy for you.

04:45.033 --> 04:48.066
Now, come on.
Let's take your things inside.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.266
You know, Dorothy,
I just thought of something.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.834
Lorraine's family's going to be black,
too, aren't they?

04:56.834 --> 04:59.800
Yes, Rose. You could probably
make them feel welcome

04:59.867 --> 05:03.100
if you'd do your version of that dance
the Huxtables do

05:03.166 --> 05:05.934
at the beginning of<i> The Cosby Show.</i>

05:09.734 --> 05:14.233
(soft music playing)

05:14.300 --> 05:17.500
All right how much longer do I have
to have this hot towel on my face?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.133
Now, just be patient, Rose.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.066
When I tell you to remove this towel

05:21.133 --> 05:23.734
you are gonna see
what a dramatic difference

05:23.800 --> 05:26.700
Blanche's miracle beauty
treatment has made already.

05:26.767 --> 05:30.300
Honey, you will be transformed
into a totally new woman.

05:30.367 --> 05:31.033
(Rose giggles)

05:31.100 --> 05:31.967
-You ready?
-(Rose) Mm-hm.

05:32.033 --> 05:35.133
All right, one, two, three.

05:37.166 --> 05:40.500
Oh, my God, I look horrible.

05:40.567 --> 05:42.900
Oh, Dorothy it's you. I...

05:49.166 --> 05:53.867
I'm sorry, Rose, I'm sorry.
I forgot it was a full moon.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.667
Are Michael and Lorraine here yet?

05:56.734 --> 05:58.834
No, but they should be any minute.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.867
-You seem a little nervous.
-Oh, I am.

06:01.934 --> 06:04.667
Are you nervous because you
haven't met Michael's fiancée?

06:04.734 --> 06:05.900
No, Rose.

06:05.967 --> 06:10.467
I'm nervous because if Sonny Bono
gets elected mayor of Palm Springs,

06:10.533 --> 06:15.433
he's gonna make all the postmen wear
leather bell bottoms and a fur vest.

06:19.867 --> 06:22.066
Dorothy, if you're nervous
about meeting Lorraine,

06:22.133 --> 06:24.700
-why just think how nervous she must be.
-Oh, I know. I know.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.100
I'll never forget
when I first met Stan's mother.

06:27.166 --> 06:30.367
Can I ask a dumb question?

06:31.200 --> 06:33.500
Better than anyone I know.

06:35.734 --> 06:39.033
What color is black people's dandruff?

06:43.266 --> 06:45.333
Rose, black people don't have dandruff.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.367
God figures
they've been through enough already.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.700
(doorbell rings)

06:52.400 --> 06:54.200
(sighs)

06:57.900 --> 06:59.867
Hello. You must be Michael's mother.

06:59.934 --> 07:01.700
You must be Lorraine's mother.

07:01.767 --> 07:03.900
We weren't expecting
you until tomorrow.

07:03.967 --> 07:07.200
What do you think, Ma?
Is she beautiful?

07:08.533 --> 07:13.867
Oh, wow! He's really getting along great
with his future mother-in-law.

07:15.834 --> 07:18.100
Rose, that's Lorraine, you idiot.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.266
Lorraine, I'm terribly sorry.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.433
Oh, that's all right.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.033
A lot of people are confused
by the age difference.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.500
I am 44 years old.

07:26.567 --> 07:30.867
Wow! This is great! I was afraid we
wouldn't have anything in common.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.133
We're almost the same age!

07:34.200 --> 07:37.200
Rose! You make her sound
like an old woman.

07:37.266 --> 07:40.734
Actually, she's much closer to my age.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.400
Lorraine, these are my roommates.

07:42.467 --> 07:44.700
That's Blanche Devereaux,
Rose Nylund.

07:44.767 --> 07:48.033
-Michael tells us you're a singer.
-That's right.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.200
-You must know all the oldies!
-Rose.

07:53.467 --> 07:56.233
I'll show you where
to put your things.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.900
-Thank you, Blanche.
-(Blanche) Mm-hm.

08:00.233 --> 08:02.000
Rose, will you excuse us?

08:02.066 --> 08:04.800
-Sure. Where you going?
-Nowhere! Get out!

08:07.767 --> 08:10.600
-Mom, is something wrong?
-No, no. Absolutely nothing,

08:10.667 --> 08:14.600
except you never mentioned
how much older Lorraine is.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.800
-It slipped my mind.
-Slipped your mind?

08:16.867 --> 08:21.600
-Michael, she's twice your age.
-What's the big deal?

08:21.667 --> 08:23.500
You said last night, huh?

08:23.567 --> 08:26.800
What matters in marriage
is if two people love each other.

08:26.867 --> 08:28.767
-This is different.
-What makes it different?

08:28.834 --> 08:32.734
You're my son. I don't want to see
you make a big mistake.

08:33.467 --> 08:36.100
You're saying you think this is a mistake.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.500
I'm not sure.

08:37.567 --> 08:41.533
For someone who's not sure,
you're sure saying a hell of a lot.

08:41.600 --> 08:46.166
Maybe the big mistake
was coming here in the first place.

08:46.834 --> 08:49.500
(gloomy music playing)

08:49.567 --> 08:51.500
(door closes)

08:57.600 --> 09:00.700
-Dorothy, I thought you went to bed.
-I can't sleep.

09:00.767 --> 09:04.066
I'm thinking about Michael and Lorraine.

09:04.133 --> 09:06.066
A word of caution.

09:06.133 --> 09:09.667
I almost lost my Becky
when I interfered in her business.

09:09.734 --> 09:11.533
It's not worth it.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.900
Blanche is right.

09:12.967 --> 09:16.867
The same thing happened to the Vigbotters
back in St. Olaf.

09:17.533 --> 09:20.233
You see,
Gretchen had this thing for Buddy,

09:20.300 --> 09:22.100
but Mr. Vigbotter didn't approve.

09:22.166 --> 09:26.433
He tried to keep them apart,
but one day he came home early,

09:26.500 --> 09:29.633
and he found Gretchen and Buddy in...

09:29.700 --> 09:33.700
how will I say it?
A most indelicate situation.

09:33.767 --> 09:34.967
What did he do?

09:35.033 --> 09:38.066
Well, he yelled at them to stop,
but they wouldn't,

09:38.133 --> 09:40.533
so he turned the hose on them.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.600
He turned the hose on them?

09:44.667 --> 09:47.066
They were in the front yard.

09:47.133 --> 09:50.400
-Ohh!
-Wait a minute, Rose.

09:50.467 --> 09:53.567
Buddy and Gretchen weren't people,
were they?

09:53.633 --> 09:56.867
Of course not. They were dogs.

09:57.467 --> 10:00.367
Gretchen was a Dalmatian,
and Buddy was a Schnauzer.

10:00.433 --> 10:06.834
Mr. Vigbotter wasn't too happy when he
ended up with a litter of Schnalmatians.

10:13.734 --> 10:15.633
You know, Rose...

10:16.367 --> 10:20.200
sometimes I wish somebody
had turned the hose on your parents.

10:23.066 --> 10:26.667
-Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
-Not at all.

10:26.734 --> 10:30.900
We're going see if we fit
into our bathing suits yet.

10:30.967 --> 10:35.166
Blanche says we'd have better luck
if we sprayed our fannies with pam.

10:41.033 --> 10:42.600
(clears throat)

10:42.934 --> 10:46.700
I'd forgotten how cool it gets here
this time of year.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.500
You picked the right time to visit.

10:49.567 --> 10:52.533
Another month, it would be very humid.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.333
You don't know humid till you've been
in St. Louis in mid-August.

10:56.400 --> 11:00.333
I hear it gets very humid there,
especially in mid-August.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.567
Incredibly humid. It's hot, sticky--

11:02.633 --> 11:03.967
Why are you marrying my son?

11:04.033 --> 11:07.433
I'm glad someone finally mentioned that.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.967
Dorothy, I don't blame you
for having your doubts.

11:10.033 --> 11:11.900
I have more than doubts.

11:12.367 --> 11:15.400
The two of you have
so many differences.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.900
He's 23. You are 44.

11:18.967 --> 11:23.633
He's white. You're black.
He is 23. You are 44.

11:23.700 --> 11:24.700
You said that already.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.767
I'm sorry. I just can't get past that one.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.600
(sighs)
Look, Dorothy.

11:29.667 --> 11:32.000
Let me tell you something about myself.

11:32.633 --> 11:36.367
When I was 18,
I was married to the boy next door.

11:36.433 --> 11:39.900
My family and friends
thought we were the perfect couple.

11:40.433 --> 11:45.200
We stayed married for 20 years,
but I don't think we were ever in love.

11:46.133 --> 11:50.934
It just seemed as though we should be,
and I learned something from that.

11:51.567 --> 11:54.834
It doesn't matter what anybody thinks.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.000
It's how you feel about each other.

11:58.934 --> 12:00.900
Am I making any sense?

12:00.967 --> 12:03.133
You're making a lot of sense.

12:03.200 --> 12:07.166
I was married to a boy next door
once myself.

12:07.233 --> 12:08.767
So we have your blessing?

12:08.834 --> 12:11.800
I'd like to say yes, but I can't.

12:11.867 --> 12:13.734
Everything you've said is logical,

12:13.800 --> 12:17.066
but I'm a mother,
and a mother doesn't have to be logical.

12:17.133 --> 12:21.066
I'm awfully sorry. I just don't approve.

12:21.734 --> 12:23.934
I'm sorry you feel that way.

12:25.633 --> 12:29.433
(soft music playing)

12:37.233 --> 12:42.100
Lorraine's mother's not the least
concerned about our age difference.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.467
She's entitled to her opinion.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.667
You are being very small-minded.

12:46.734 --> 12:49.133
A wise philosopher once said,

12:49.200 --> 12:52.767
"There are no small minds,
just big heads."

12:54.166 --> 12:56.000
-What the hell does that mean?
-I'm not sure.

12:57.367 --> 13:00.967
Actually, it wasn't a philosopher.
It was Rose.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.500
You are impossible.

13:07.367 --> 13:08.567
(doorbell rings)

13:13.033 --> 13:16.133
Hello. We're a little early.
I'm Greta Wagner.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.667
These are my sisters Trudy and Libby.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.533
(chuckles)
I'm so sorry. The house is such a mess.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.033
It's neater than our maid ever gets ours.

13:26.100 --> 13:28.500
I'd hire you anytime.

13:31.133 --> 13:33.567
-Mama!
-Baby!

13:33.633 --> 13:36.333
-How are you?
-Oh, fine. How y'all?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.367
-Have you met Dorothy?
-No, actually, they haven't.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.667
You must be Michael's parents.

13:52.734 --> 13:54.166
Mama, put your glasses on.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.033
(both laugh)

13:56.934 --> 13:58.700
Oh, my Lord.

14:00.066 --> 14:03.967
This is mud on our faces.
We're not really black.

14:05.633 --> 14:09.700
Mama, Aunt Trudy, Aunt Libby,
this is Blanche Devereaux.

14:10.233 --> 14:11.800
This is Rose Nylund.

14:11.867 --> 14:14.567
And this is Michael's mother Dorothy.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.767
And this is Michael.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.500
-This is Michael?
-Yes.

14:21.767 --> 14:24.567
-Uh-huh!
-Mama, we've talked about this.

14:24.633 --> 14:25.934
I told you he was younger.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.166
But you sure
didn't tell me he was white.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.767
No daughter of mine
is marrying some skinny white boy.

14:42.600 --> 14:47.266
(soft music playing)

14:47.333 --> 14:51.800
Wait a minute.
Who are you calling a skinny white boy?

14:51.867 --> 14:53.900
I think she meant Michael.

14:57.533 --> 14:58.667
You got that right!

14:58.734 --> 14:59.667
Oh, it was easy.

14:59.734 --> 15:01.367
Oh, shut up, Rose.

15:03.066 --> 15:07.166
I'm not thrilled about my son
marrying your daughter either.

15:07.233 --> 15:10.867
Oh, yeah? Why?
You got something against black people?

15:10.934 --> 15:14.667
Of course not,
and I resent the insinuation.

15:14.734 --> 15:18.100
We firmly believe
all men are created equal.

15:18.166 --> 15:19.500
That's a bunch of baloney.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.166
Rose!

15:21.233 --> 15:24.734
Well, if you don't believe me,
just turn on your television set

15:24.800 --> 15:29.300
and watch a white person dance
on<i> Soul Train.</i>

15:31.033 --> 15:33.367
Race is not even an issue.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.934
Your daughter's twice my son's age.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.567
What can a woman in her 40s
have in common with a boy in his 20s?

15:40.633 --> 15:41.900
Sex.

15:44.433 --> 15:46.667
At 20, a man is at his peak.

15:46.734 --> 15:48.900
A woman in her 40s
is also at her peak.

15:48.967 --> 15:51.734
When they come together, hot damn!

15:55.934 --> 15:59.333
Lorraine,
if you want a young man, fine.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.867
Just make it a young black man.

16:01.934 --> 16:07.333
I could name 10 fine, rich, young
black men off the top of my head.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.834
Wait till I get a pencil.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.467
Mama, I love Michael.

16:16.533 --> 16:18.066
I don't care about his color.

16:18.133 --> 16:21.734
Honey, it's just a phase.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.266
Ever since Diana Ross
started marrying white men,

16:24.333 --> 16:26.633
everyone's got to have one.

16:27.834 --> 16:28.700
(door opens)

16:38.333 --> 16:41.500
What is this,
a revival of<i> Raisin in the Sun?</i>

16:45.633 --> 16:48.066
Grandma,
this is my fiancée Lorraine,

16:48.133 --> 16:50.367
her mother, and her two aunts.

16:50.433 --> 16:53.500
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.900
-This is your fiancée?
-Yeah, that's right.

16:57.967 --> 17:00.100
You couldn't find someone your own age?

17:00.166 --> 17:01.834
What's that mean?

17:01.900 --> 17:05.300
Your daughter looks like
she's been around the block

17:05.367 --> 17:07.734
more times than the good humor man.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.433
Hold my purse.
Those are fighting words.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.166
Stop it! All of you!

17:14.233 --> 17:18.066
What difference does it make
that Lorraine's a little long in the tooth

17:18.133 --> 17:21.266
and Michael's a skinny white boy?

17:21.633 --> 17:23.800
Can't you see they love each other?

17:23.867 --> 17:27.834
We should be celebrating,
not arguing whether it's right.

17:27.900 --> 17:31.533
Now, what do you say
we all join hands

17:31.600 --> 17:35.867
and sing a chorus
of "Abraham, Martin, and John"?

17:37.433 --> 17:43.033
-Is she for real?
-Yes, frightening, isn't it?

17:44.734 --> 17:48.433
Whatever anyone thinks,
we're getting married, and that's final.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.333
Lorraine, you marry him,
you'll regret it the rest of your life.

17:52.967 --> 17:54.467
Come on, girls.

17:54.533 --> 17:58.000
-Michael, you're making a mistake.
-It's my life, mom.

18:01.166 --> 18:03.967
-We can't let them go through with it.
-Dorothy, they're adults.

18:04.033 --> 18:07.200
-Adults can do whatever they want.
-Not necessarily.

18:07.266 --> 18:11.433
Adults can't ride
the little horsy at the A&amp;P.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.333
(soft music playing)

18:19.400 --> 18:21.567
Dorothy, what are you still doing up?

18:21.633 --> 18:25.166
Oh, I couldn't sleep
so I thought I'd watch a little TV

18:25.233 --> 18:28.533
to unwind,
take my mind of my troubles.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.767
-What are you watching?
<i>-Judgment at Nuremberg.</i>

18:34.133 --> 18:36.867
Oh, Rose,
do you think I did the right thing?

18:36.934 --> 18:40.033
Well, sure,
if you don't care how the movie ends?

18:40.100 --> 18:42.567
I meant about Michael and Lorraine.

18:42.633 --> 18:43.300
Oh.

18:43.767 --> 18:44.900
What's gonna on?

18:44.967 --> 18:48.400
Oh, Dorothy's upset
about Michael and Lorraine.

18:48.467 --> 18:49.133
Really?

18:49.200 --> 18:52.734
Oh, how would you feel if your son
were marrying an older woman?

18:52.800 --> 18:57.867
When my son was five years old
he nearly burned down our whole town.

18:57.934 --> 19:01.233
Since then nothing he does upsets me.

19:01.300 --> 19:04.767
Hell, he could marry
Lillian Gish and I wouldn't care.

19:04.834 --> 19:07.166
(doorbell rings)

19:12.567 --> 19:16.500
I hope we didn't wake you.
We couldn't sleep.

19:16.567 --> 19:19.333
We felt terrible about what we said.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.066
We didn't agree on much, did we?

19:22.133 --> 19:25.767
Neither of us
wants this marriage to happen.

19:25.834 --> 19:30.467
Instead of fighting, why don't we sit down
and figure a way out?

19:30.533 --> 19:31.633
Do you like cheesecake?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.166
Can Ella shatter glass?

19:34.233 --> 19:36.834
(all laugh)

19:41.033 --> 19:44.633
(all laughing)

19:44.700 --> 19:48.233
This cheesecake is delicious.

19:48.300 --> 19:52.667
-It's not bad for store-bought.
-I'd love some more coffee.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.834
I'll put on another pot.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.800
What's all the racket?

19:56.867 --> 19:59.533
Oh,
Martha and the Vandellas are back.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.300
Ma!

20:01.367 --> 20:04.767
(laughs) It's okay.
I've got one at home just like her.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.633
You have one at home?

20:06.700 --> 20:09.367
"One at home"?
What am I, a Cocker Spaniel?

20:10.333 --> 20:13.033
Why not give me a sock to chew on?

20:14.033 --> 20:15.734
I'm glad you're here.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.700
There's something important
we didn't discuss,

20:18.767 --> 20:21.667
and I'd like to clear it up first.

20:21.734 --> 20:23.066
What is it?

20:24.800 --> 20:28.533
Is it true what they say
about black men in bed?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.066
Oh, yes. Definitely.

20:39.633 --> 20:44.633
Oh, yes, definitely that is something
I would like to know about too.

20:47.633 --> 20:50.033
Blanche, please. That's a stereotype.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.734
Call it whatever you want.
I'm just grateful it's true.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.500
(all laughing)

20:59.033 --> 21:02.200
Isn't it great how we're getting along?

21:02.266 --> 21:06.100
Michael and Lorraine
didn't have to elope after all.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.233
(laughs)

21:08.300 --> 21:09.500
What did you say, Rose?

21:09.567 --> 21:11.100
"Elope"?

21:11.166 --> 21:13.700
Oh, no. I promised I wouldn't tell.

21:13.767 --> 21:15.133
Rose.

21:15.200 --> 21:19.767
I ran into them
leaving for the all-night wedding chapel.

21:19.834 --> 21:21.266
I know the one.

21:21.333 --> 21:24.166
I'm right behind you. Sisters, come on!

21:26.066 --> 21:30.467
(soft music playing)

21:32.200 --> 21:36.633
Excuse me. Did a white man and a wrinkled,
old black woman just come here?

21:38.033 --> 21:43.467
She meant a regal black woman
and a scuzzy little white boy.

21:43.533 --> 21:45.667
What are you all doing here?

21:45.734 --> 21:49.100
-Stopping you.
-I forbid you to get married.

21:49.166 --> 21:53.000
Same here. He's not good enough.
You can do better.

21:53.066 --> 21:57.633
When's the last time you looked
at the merchandise you're trying to move?

22:00.300 --> 22:04.266
We love you very much.
We also love each other.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.400
Now we're getting married,
and if you can't deal with that,

22:07.467 --> 22:09.033
you don't have to see us.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.800
That means you also won't see
your grandchild.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.033
Say what?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.500
I'm pregnant.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.100
(Greta clears throat)

22:22.166 --> 22:24.200
Oh, Greta, let's talk a moment.

22:24.266 --> 22:26.967
I was going to ask you the same thing.

22:27.867 --> 22:31.100
They'll marry whether we like it or not.
Do you like it?

22:31.166 --> 22:32.633
-No.
-Me, neither.

22:32.700 --> 22:36.100
They're having a baby.

22:36.166 --> 22:37.967
-You want to see it?
-Yes.

22:38.033 --> 22:40.467
Me, too. What'll we do?

22:40.533 --> 22:44.500
Ugh, what mothers have done since
the beginning of time,

22:44.567 --> 22:46.600
pretend that we're happy

22:46.667 --> 22:49.667
and then complain
to anybody who'll listen.

22:51.066 --> 22:54.633
-Michael, congratulations!
-Congratulations, Lorraine.

22:54.700 --> 22:57.367
Is the Zbornak-Wagner party ready?

22:57.433 --> 22:59.233
I think we are.

22:59.300 --> 23:02.800
Wait a minute. Lorraine needs
something old, something new

23:02.867 --> 23:04.934
and something borrowed and something blue.

23:05.533 --> 23:06.533
(chuckles)

23:06.600 --> 23:08.900
Here, this is blue.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.233
These earrings are old.
They were my grandmother's.

23:13.300 --> 23:17.700
Here. I borrowed these knee-high
surgical stockings on the bus.

23:17.767 --> 23:20.934
Ma! Here, Lorraine.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.333
Oh, thank you.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.767
-That's everything but the new.
-Oh, Michael gave me that.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.333
(laughs)

23:27.900 --> 23:29.300
Let's go.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.467
(Michael sighs)

23:31.467 --> 23:34.000
(women) Aww.

23:34.066 --> 23:37.734
-I can't believe it. A grandchild.
-Little Roger.

23:37.800 --> 23:41.967
Roger? What do you want him to be,
a choreographer?

23:42.033 --> 23:46.533
-It's Lamar.
-Lamar Zbornak.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.867
Why not just pin a "kick me" sign on him?
It's Roger.

23:49.934 --> 23:53.667
-(Greta) Lamar.
-(Dorothy) Roger.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.166
Fabulous. I'm looking forward
to Thanksgiving already.

24:04.266 --> 24:08.500
(theme music playing)
