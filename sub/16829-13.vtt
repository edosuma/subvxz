WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.402
<i> Previously on</i> scorpion...
Uh-oh.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.471
Someone you're avoiding
knows you're back in L.A.?

00:05.473 --> 00:06.505
They didn't...

00:06.507 --> 00:08.107
But they will now.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.742
It was made clear to me that

00:09.744 --> 00:11.510
everyone's feelings
should be heard.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.178
Not just mine.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.580
You know this will flame out
when you eventually snap

00:14.582 --> 00:16.281
like a rubber band.
Being genial isn't your nature.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.150
Paige:
<i> I'm trying a new approach,</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:19.518
and best way to help him

00:19.520 --> 00:20.986
is to throw him
into the deep end.

00:20.987 --> 00:22.453
I am running for
the 16th district alderman

00:22.456 --> 00:23.589
of west altadenia

00:23.591 --> 00:25.357
in the local
upcoming election.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.759
I-i answered
everything honestly.

00:26.761 --> 00:29.695
In politics, honesty'll
get you crushed.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.632
Narrator:
Throughout American history,

00:33.634 --> 00:36.168
we, the people, have had
candidates known for strength,

00:36.170 --> 00:37.636
integrity...

00:37.638 --> 00:41.540
Courage...
And then there's this guy.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.046
Can Sylvester dodd
really help west altadenia?

00:47.048 --> 00:50.249
Only if you believe
in magic spells.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.718
Vote patel for alderman.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.521
They edited this
to make me look ridiculous.

00:55.523 --> 00:56.822
Yeah, it was the editing.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.724
Politics is a bar-room brawl.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.560
I wouldn't manage you
if I didn't believe in you, kid.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.763
When I look at you, I see
everything you have to offer.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.598
Thank you, cabe.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.367
But when everyone else
looks at you,

01:08.369 --> 01:10.502
they see a man-child
wearing a cloak.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.838
It's time to ditch
the costumes

01:12.840 --> 01:14.506
and act like an adult.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.574
I have.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.309
Happy told me to be myself.

01:17.311 --> 01:21.246
There's just film of me
role-playing.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.581
In garb.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.484
You will be the first politician
taken down

01:25.486 --> 01:28.320
by a never-had-sex tape.
(Door opens, closes)

01:28.322 --> 01:30.422
This city is
full of incompetents.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.590
Hey, Walt, you okay?

01:33.661 --> 01:35.461
That's a no.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.663
That's a hell of a shiner.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.298
I went to fro-yo-ma.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.433
I was very much looking
forward to my cello shell-o:

01:41.435 --> 01:43.052
Liquid chocolate topping

01:43.053 --> 01:44.670
that dries into a delicious
hard candy shell,

01:44.672 --> 01:46.839
when the intractable clerk

01:46.841 --> 01:49.541
refused to give me two punches
on my loyalty card.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.310
Why would
you get two punches?

01:51.312 --> 01:53.545
Because the loyalty card
clearly states,

01:53.547 --> 01:56.615
"one punch per purchase."
I purchased two cello shell-os.

01:56.617 --> 02:00.185
One for me, one for Ralph.
Two purchases, two punches.

02:00.187 --> 02:02.554
One could argue
that you made one purchase

02:02.556 --> 02:04.756
that included two items.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.459
Yes, such a stupid argument
could be made,

02:07.461 --> 02:10.362
and it was, by the clerk,
and things got... heated.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.897
And you got the extra punch?

02:11.899 --> 02:14.133
Not the one I was looking for.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.436
Morning.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.705
Apparently not for you.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.157
I was assaulted

02:21.158 --> 02:22.608
by a contract-breaching
yogurt vendor.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.842
Okay.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.278
Hey, uh, Paige?

02:26.280 --> 02:28.313
Happy?
Got a sec?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.857
Fro-yo-ma just made the list.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.293
What are you talking about?
It's a yogurt joint.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.895
No, i-i get that, but why
are you writing it down?

02:42.897 --> 02:44.630
To keep track.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.898
I-I'm lost.
Keep track of what?

02:45.900 --> 02:47.599
Let me explain.

02:47.601 --> 02:51.703
Before you joined the team,
Walter's eq was dangerously low.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.772
He often got into disputes
with civilians

02:53.774 --> 02:56.408
he had contact with,
which led him to be banned

02:56.410 --> 02:58.777
from a number
of L.A. establishments:

02:58.779 --> 03:00.179
Restaurants,
hardware stores...

03:00.181 --> 03:01.480
That a dentist?

03:01.482 --> 03:03.382
Yeah, he's not welcome back
at Dr. goldfarb's.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.350
It got so bad we had
to create a system

03:05.352 --> 03:07.819
that measures Walt's eq
to warn of impending danger.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.188
Yeah, it's based on

03:09.189 --> 03:10.556
the defcon
nuclear threat system,

03:10.558 --> 03:11.657
which is apt,

03:11.659 --> 03:12.724
since when
Walter's eq is low,

03:12.726 --> 03:13.959
he is also a radioactive,

03:13.961 --> 03:16.295
destructive peril
to civilization.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.696
Happy:
A five means all is well.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.598
Purely theoretical.
It's never happened.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.800
Paige:
And a one means...

03:21.802 --> 03:22.834
He's gone nuclear.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.269
Since you joined the team

03:24.271 --> 03:25.304
and began helping him,

03:25.306 --> 03:26.789
he's been at a steady four.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.273
Toby: But now that
you have started this

03:28.275 --> 03:30.842
sink-or-swim plan where he's
on his own, he has slipped down

03:30.844 --> 03:32.377
to a three.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.679
Paige, you have to help him

03:33.681 --> 03:34.680
before he gets worse.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.815
No. I am trying to help Walter

03:36.817 --> 03:38.650
become
a fully functioning human.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.818
This is the best
way to do that.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.486
He might stumble, okay?

03:41.488 --> 03:43.288
But eventually, he will learn.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.924
You've had success
with Walter in the past.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.559
If you think this
is the way to go,

03:47.561 --> 03:48.827
we're behind you.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.896
(Door creaks)

03:51.999 --> 03:53.899
Thank you.
Excuse me.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.768
Walter's gonna
be a disaster.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.471
Of biblical proportions.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.775
You okay?

04:03.777 --> 04:05.611
I couldn't sleep last night.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.312
That's what happens when
you realize that the men

04:07.314 --> 04:08.680
who want you dead
know you're back in town.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.716
Not to mention they saw you
with scorpion.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.418
Our address is listed.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.119
Those guys shot at us
twice already.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.820
When they came after us on the
road, they thought I was alone.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.789
They had no idea
i was part of a group

04:17.791 --> 04:19.491
that has government ties.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.393
They know that now,

04:21.394 --> 04:23.294
so they're not just gonna
come barging in here...

04:23.297 --> 04:25.664
But at the same time...

04:25.666 --> 04:27.266
We're a bit in the crosshairs.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.867
I never wanted
to put you all in danger.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.504
I just need my cash,
and then I'll go far away.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.538
Here comes the rub.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.673
That abandoned factory

04:34.675 --> 04:36.842
where we found
the nuclear device?

04:36.844 --> 04:37.976
I buried the money there.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.545
That's why you
jackhammered the floor.

04:40.547 --> 04:43.649
I went back last week
to finish and get my cash,

04:43.651 --> 04:45.751
and the workers showed up,
and I bolted before they saw me,

04:45.753 --> 04:47.853
but now there's security
there full-time,

04:47.855 --> 04:49.554
and I need your help
to get it back.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.790
I don't do cons anymore.
I prefer the straight life--

04:51.792 --> 04:53.992
a stable, honest job,
a secure life.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.727
(Snores)

04:55.729 --> 04:58.530
Oh, I'm so sorry. I fell
asleep for a second there.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.333
Please, honey.
One last con for mommy.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.601
Cabe:
Saddle up, everyone.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.870
Time to leave for Colton.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.872
What's in Colton?
Besides cows.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.874
U.S. army corps of engineers

05:08.876 --> 05:11.410
hired us to help
some sandhog workers

05:11.412 --> 05:13.345
locate a leak
in a municipal waterline.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.080
You can't go.
I need you.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.049
This is it.
One last time.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.650
I promise.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.920
I get my money,
and I can disappear forever.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.756
I never liked helping you
with one of your schemes,

05:24.758 --> 05:26.458
not when I was nine
and certainly not now,

05:26.460 --> 05:28.894
but I... don't want
my friends in danger,

05:28.896 --> 05:30.829
and I really don't
want Ralph in danger,

05:30.831 --> 05:31.897
so I will help you get
the money, but this time,

05:31.899 --> 05:32.898
I'm in charge.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.800
Fantastic.
You have always had

05:34.802 --> 05:35.935
a natural gift
for my line of work.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.069
I cannot wait to see
what you come up with.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.338
Just... get your coat.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.975
Oh, hey.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.812
You don't need me
for a simple engineering job,

05:46.814 --> 05:48.814
so I'm gonna help my mom
out with something.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.382
Well, we're dealing
with civilians.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.917
It's always good to have
you there as a buffer.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.552
You'll be fine.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.787
Besides, it's good eq practice
for Walter, and who knows?

05:55.789 --> 05:58.390
Maybe he'll finally
start acting like a...

05:58.392 --> 06:00.492
Polite, normal human being.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.027
Attention, mole rats!

06:02.896 --> 06:04.930
They're called sandhogs.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.998
I am aware, but the
nickname is illogical.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.501
There is no "sandhog"
in the zoological taxonomy,

06:09.503 --> 06:11.753
and since they work underground,

06:11.754 --> 06:14.004
lack vitamin d, and are prone
to sallow skin like mole rats,

06:14.007 --> 06:16.074
a blind underground rodent
is a fitting moniker.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.009
You must be Walter o'brien.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.413
Heard a lot about you,
apparently all true.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.582
Cabe gallo.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.417
Homeland.

06:25.419 --> 06:30.088
Sorry about him.
He's just, uh...

06:30.090 --> 06:31.923
There's no point in explaining.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.892
Call me chief.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.796
I run this sandhog unit, and i
suggest you use the proper term

06:37.798 --> 06:40.799
or one of my men might
give you a matching set.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.869
I'll, uh, brief you
over here.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.138
This underground pipe
carries water

06:46.140 --> 06:49.174
that cools the adjacent
industrial fertilizer plant.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.609
Now, a few weeks ago,

06:50.611 --> 06:52.411
the pressure readings
started dropping.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.812
Army corps called us.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.914
We found a fissure
that we promptly fixed

06:55.916 --> 06:58.116
with the calcium
hydroxide mortar.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.986
The water pressure improved,
but didn't return to normal.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.854
So, there's a second leak.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.624
Yes. We just can't find it.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.792
Army corps said that

07:06.794 --> 07:07.993
you guys helped save a kid

07:07.995 --> 07:10.996
from a sinkhole at the beach
a few years ago.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.431
Wanted you brought in.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.899
Well, if you and your men

07:13.901 --> 07:15.767
please stay out of our way
while we work,

07:15.769 --> 07:18.703
we should have the situation
rectified very shortly.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.139
All right, how about
before you bench my team,

07:21.141 --> 07:23.175
you tell me how you plan
to find the leak.

07:23.177 --> 07:26.578
Maybe this guy can use, uh,
one of his magic spells?

07:27.481 --> 07:28.647
I'm from west altadenia.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.715
Oh, wonderful.
Can I count on your vote?

07:30.717 --> 07:31.917
No.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.720
We'll use echolocation
to find the leak.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.790
Each of us has
a remote scanner

07:38.792 --> 07:40.192
which emits sound waves.

07:40.194 --> 07:43.195
They'll transmit data
to my tablet,

07:43.197 --> 07:45.153
which will compute it

07:45.154 --> 07:47.110
and pinpoint the source
of the problem.

07:47.111 --> 07:49.067
Okay, but if you need to inspect
other sections of pipe,

07:49.069 --> 07:50.902
you let me know
and I'll accompany you,

07:50.904 --> 07:51.903
'cause it could be dangerous.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.005
What's that for?

07:54.007 --> 07:55.807
Chief:
We installed safety nets

07:55.808 --> 07:57.608
throughout the tunnels,
strong enough to catch someone

07:57.611 --> 07:59.744
even if propelled
by a rush of water.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.746
You take a lot
of precautions.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.114
You said the word
"danger" and "safety"

08:03.116 --> 08:05.150
two times in the
last ten seconds.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.952
You've had recent
experience with accidents?

08:10.123 --> 08:11.756
Hey.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.091
We lost a foreman

08:13.093 --> 08:14.993
in an underground water break
six months ago.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.328
Chief knew him for 20 years,

08:16.329 --> 08:17.662
so how about you give him
a little room, huh?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.731
Oh, we'll give him
all the room he needs.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.032
We can handle it from here.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.104
Toby: Walter has no idea
how insensitive he sounds.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.839
This is great.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.608
Paige's plan is going
like gangbusters so far.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.711
You're the shrink.
Straighten Walt out.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.247
Well, my relationship
with him is complicated.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.015
He's gonna think that
I'm manipulating him,

08:37.017 --> 08:39.684
and he'll resist my help.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.019
It has to be you.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.090
You think I have the emotional
ability to handle Walt?

08:45.092 --> 08:48.660
Oh, absolutely not,
but what choice do we have?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.931
(Indistinct chatter)

08:58.639 --> 09:01.039
This is one quality fake ID,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.642
all with supplies
from the corner copy shop.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.227
I knew you had the gift.

09:05.228 --> 09:06.811
Yeah, well, happy taught me
a few things over the years.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.847
Here. Do as I say.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.949
No questions asked.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.552
So bossy.
I love it.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.254
Paige:
Who's the foreman here?

09:16.256 --> 09:17.622
Who's asking?

09:17.624 --> 09:18.790
Osha.

09:18.792 --> 09:19.958
This is an inspection.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.826
All work stops now.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.828
This place was
red-flagged weeks ago.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.541
The basement pillars
are unstable.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.253
They've already been inspected
and approved for demo.

09:27.254 --> 09:28.965
This is a spot safety check.
Now, stop all work

09:28.969 --> 09:31.303
or this job gets
a new foreman.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.872
Wipe the grin off your face,

09:33.874 --> 09:35.740
and start the inspection

09:35.742 --> 09:38.009
or this guy won't be the only
one looking for a new paycheck.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.717
Happy: I got something
in sly's section.

09:45.719 --> 09:46.985
Yeah, I got a ping,
but I don't see any leaks.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.753
That's because
they're microleaks.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.989
Hundreds of them,
all invisible to the naked eye,

09:50.991 --> 09:53.825
leaking water into the soil
above and around us.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.861
With that many leaks,
the water loss would be massive.

09:56.863 --> 10:00.265
And since this is karst terrain
underlaid by soluble limestone,

10:00.267 --> 10:02.067
that water would create

10:02.069 --> 10:04.269
an enormous,
subterranean reservoir.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.371
Which has dissolved
into the limestone,

10:06.373 --> 10:08.106
weakening the ground
surrounding this pipe.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.908
Ground here is already weak.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.978
You know, we're right above
the San Fernando aquifer,

10:12.980 --> 10:14.279
one of the largest sources

10:14.281 --> 10:16.648
of drinking water
for Southern California.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.700
This is a problem.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.751
Cover subsidence sinkholes
can occur anywhere excess water

10:20.754 --> 10:22.754
dissolves soluble rock
below the surface.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.923
There is a strong likelihood
a sinkhole could open up here.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.726
Like those giant sinkholes
in Florida?

10:27.728 --> 10:31.029
Those things are portals
to hell, only less hospitable.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.931
If we disturb the
soil any further,

10:32.933 --> 10:34.132
we could trigger a cave-in.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.768
Stop the work.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.870
That man didn't hear you.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.305
He's wearing
headphones.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.973
He turns that thing on,

10:41.975 --> 10:43.708
he's gonna shake up the soil.

10:43.710 --> 10:44.709
And then
we have a cave in.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.312
(Motor whirring)

10:47.314 --> 10:49.681
Too late, the
earth's giving way.

10:49.683 --> 10:50.882
Everyone evacuate, now!

10:50.884 --> 10:53.852
Stop the work!
Go, go, go, go, go!

10:54.688 --> 10:56.721
(Rumbling)

11:00.861 --> 11:02.027
(Rumbling continues)

11:02.029 --> 11:03.762
Everyone run as
far as you can!

11:03.764 --> 11:05.163
Here it comes!

11:05.165 --> 11:06.831
(Rumbling)

11:10.671 --> 11:11.736
♪ ♪

11:20.981 --> 11:23.848
Come on, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving!

11:23.850 --> 11:25.183
Come on.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.951
(Rumbling)

11:29.990 --> 11:30.989
That building.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.724
It only houses
machinery.

11:32.726 --> 11:33.825
There's no one inside.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.327
But we're not out
of the woods.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.828
Sinkholes in this type
of soil structure

11:36.830 --> 11:38.997
will continue to grow
after the initial expanse.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.833
This thing's gonna
progressively get worse,

11:41.835 --> 11:42.901
which means we have
a new problem.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.370
That silo stores
toxic chemicals

11:45.372 --> 11:46.905
for the fertilizer
plant.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.807
If this sinkhole
widens much farther,

11:48.809 --> 11:49.841
the silo will fall in.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.176
Which is bad,
'cause we're over

11:51.178 --> 11:52.628
the San Fernando aquifer.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.079
Sylvester: And if the chemicals
get into the sinkhole,

11:54.081 --> 11:55.947
permanently contaminating
the aquifer,

11:55.949 --> 11:57.916
it'll eliminate
potable drinking water

11:57.918 --> 11:59.851
for a swath
of Southern California.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.320
Millions'll lose their homes,
businesses will be shut down,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.122
tens of thousands of acres
of farmland

12:04.124 --> 12:05.290
will be rendered useless.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.892
A fiscal and a
humanitarian disaster.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.360
We got to get those chemicals
out of that silo

12:09.362 --> 12:10.395
before it falls in.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.796
Is there an emergency
pump system?

12:11.798 --> 12:13.565
There is.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.333
In the building that just
got swallowed by the earth.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.401
What about your truck?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.303
Yeah, but it-it flows out,
not in.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.437
I can reverse it.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.372
Joe! Go in that silo

12:21.374 --> 12:23.775
and connect a drainage hose
to the holding vat,

12:23.777 --> 12:24.909
then get out, on the double.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.010
Copy that, chief.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.312
That truck's tank
isn't big enough

12:27.314 --> 12:28.780
to hold whatever's
in a full silo!

12:28.782 --> 12:30.632
Walter:
Yeah, he's right.

12:30.633 --> 12:32.483
We have to pump the chemicals
from the silo to the truck

12:32.486 --> 12:34.486
and then out into
some kind of a giant container.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.221
Yeah, we passed a dairy farm
on the way in.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.322
They got milk trucks.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.323
The silo holds

12:38.325 --> 12:40.258
almost 40,000 gallons.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.894
Happy: A large straight-chassis
truck will hold 10,000.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.896
We'll commandeer four trucks
and fill 'em up one at a time.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.799
Not to be negative or anything,
but this is completely hopeless.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.168
By my calculations,
the sinkhole is spreading

12:50.170 --> 12:51.770
too fast for us
to pump out the chemicals

12:51.772 --> 12:52.871
before the silo falls in.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.072
Then we only have
one choice.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.874
We need to slow
down the sinkhole.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.143
I know you have a god complex,
Walter, but you're talking about

12:58.145 --> 12:59.410
stopping the earth.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.112
Walter: When sinkholes
formed around the dead sea,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.982
scientists designed a canal
to relieve water pressure

13:03.984 --> 13:05.450
and stop it from spreading.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.252
So, if we can
create a relief well

13:07.254 --> 13:10.121
to drain out the excess water
that is pooling underground,

13:10.123 --> 13:11.790
then we can slow it down.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.124
Chief: In the
'20s, this area

13:13.126 --> 13:15.927
was full of Wells
that tapped into the aquifer.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.363
Even those that are a hundred
yards away are strong enough

13:18.365 --> 13:20.231
to draw water from this area,

13:20.233 --> 13:22.967
reducing the saturation
and slowing this collapse.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.003
Those Wells are in sheds
all over this valley.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.171
I could show you where.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.072
Sly, come with me.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.142
Let's get the pumps ready
on my truck.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.811
Okay.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.579
Remember, if Walter and
chief get into it again,

13:34.581 --> 13:35.580
you're Paige.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.365
You have to fix him.

13:37.366 --> 13:39.149
Is jumping in the sinkhole
an option?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.286
I'm almost done turning
your outtake valve

13:41.288 --> 13:43.054
into an intake.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.989
Toby better get here
with that dairy truck.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.425
Joe, update on the hookup!

13:48.995 --> 13:51.496
Hose is on the tank,
but the connectors don't match.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.964
They're loose.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.899
I'll stay here
and keep it secured manually.

13:54.901 --> 13:58.102
Copy that, but this sinkhole
is within 20 feet of the silo.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.872
These scorpion guys
are trying to slow its spread,

14:00.874 --> 14:02.273
but once it closes that gap
by half,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.242
you evacuate immediately.
Understood?

14:04.244 --> 14:05.276
Yes, sir.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.880
You guys finish over here yet?

14:08.882 --> 14:10.482
Outflow hose is ready.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.083
I still don't understand
how you're pulling this off.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.886
If we explained,
you probably wouldn't get it.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.554
He didn't mean it like that.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.922
Really?

14:17.924 --> 14:19.190
Then how did he mean it?

14:20.193 --> 14:22.493
Um...

14:22.495 --> 14:25.396
All he's saying is
he's way smarter than you.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.931
We all are.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.534
Toby:
Moo!

14:30.971 --> 14:34.606
I got the cow juice jitney!

14:34.608 --> 14:37.375
We fill this one up, the farm
will lend us the other three.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.511
I'll make sure there are
no kinks in the line.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.549
Let me guess, helping
Walt didn't go well?

14:44.551 --> 14:45.984
I might have
made it worse.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.018
Might've or did?

14:47.020 --> 14:48.253
I'm kind of busy

14:48.255 --> 14:50.455
trying to save ten
million Californians.

14:50.457 --> 14:53.358
I don't have time to babysit
that emotionally stunted genius.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.959
You're right,
we have a job to do.

14:54.961 --> 14:56.961
Walt's on his own,
just like Paige wanted.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.062
He gets better or he doesn't.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.998
I'm all set here!

15:00.000 --> 15:01.165
Are the mole rats ready?

15:01.167 --> 15:03.268
I'm going with "doesn't."

15:07.173 --> 15:08.506
The line's all good.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.074
Set!

15:10.076 --> 15:12.577
Joe, turn it on now.

15:12.579 --> 15:16.114
(Air hissing)
(Grunts)

15:17.450 --> 15:19.484
Out of the tank
and into the truck.

15:19.486 --> 15:20.518
And out of my connection.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.552
Toby:
And into my tanker!

15:21.554 --> 15:22.687
It's working!

15:22.689 --> 15:24.656
Happy:
Yeah, but slowly.

15:24.658 --> 15:27.058
These hoses weren't
designed for this purpose.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.404
At this rate,

15:28.405 --> 15:29.749
we won't have all
the chemicals out

15:29.750 --> 15:31.094
by the time the sinkhole
reaches the silo

15:31.097 --> 15:32.614
and it falls in.

15:32.615 --> 15:34.132
Sly and cabe better have found
that relief well,

15:34.134 --> 15:36.034
we got to stop the spread
of this earth girth.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.235
(Cabe grunts)

15:37.237 --> 15:38.269
(Gate creaking)

15:38.271 --> 15:39.504
It's heavy.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.289
That generator
is off-line,

15:41.290 --> 15:43.073
but there should be
a release valve at the bottom.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.376
It's too deep to see,
at least 70 feet.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.078
It'll draw in water
quickly,

15:47.080 --> 15:48.379
reducing saturation
in the valley,

15:48.381 --> 15:49.714
and slowing
the sink hole.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.616
So...

15:56.122 --> 15:57.288
Oh, I get it.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.357
Send the old guy.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.659
Yeah.
(Clears throat)

16:01.661 --> 16:04.028
No problem.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.263
Yeah.

16:09.202 --> 16:12.003
Where's your magic wand
when you need it?

16:12.005 --> 16:14.639
We could use one of your,
uh, illumination spells.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.240
(Laughing)

16:16.242 --> 16:18.743
Yes, good one.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.584
Foreman:
Hey!

16:28.555 --> 16:30.722
What'd you put in the briefcase?

16:32.692 --> 16:35.159
Dirt samples, I found something
i need to report.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.394
What?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.463
You know exactly
what she found.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.998
I don't.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.065
Tell me.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.500
Asbestos dust.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.168
We got a call
on our safety hotline

16:44.170 --> 16:45.169
that the gypsum in
the concrete floor

16:45.171 --> 16:46.137
was full of it.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.271
Absolutely.

16:47.273 --> 16:50.074
Totally full of it.

16:50.076 --> 16:53.411
Look, I swear I didn't know
anything about asbestos.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.712
Likely story.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.116
I'll dispose of it properly
on my own, just--

16:58.118 --> 17:00.084
just don't shut down
my job site.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.219
Sorry, we have
to send in the soil

17:01.221 --> 17:02.420
for testing and report it.
Let's go.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.390
You know, we could
look the other way

17:05.392 --> 17:07.225
if you just made it
worth our while.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.459
Like a bribe?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.294
No. No, no. No bribe.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.096
Just clean it up.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.731
Okay.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.234
Okay.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.784
(Squeaking)

17:38.224 --> 17:39.190
Got it open!

17:39.192 --> 17:40.491
Great work!

17:40.493 --> 17:42.260
It should start
slowing the sinkhole!

17:46.199 --> 17:48.299
Chief:
<i> It's getting closer.</i>

17:48.301 --> 17:50.268
How long till I can pull
my man out of that tower?

17:50.270 --> 17:51.702
The chemicals
aren't extricated yet.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.071
Happy?

17:53.073 --> 17:54.205
8,200 gallons down,

17:54.207 --> 17:55.606
31,800 to go.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.275
Joe:
Chief, I secured the connections

17:57.277 --> 17:59.243
to the hose and I've come up
to the top of the silo

17:59.245 --> 18:01.079
to open up
the containment unit vents.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.213
A change in pressure could

18:02.215 --> 18:03.347
get the chemical outflow
moving faster.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.715
Joe, get the hell
off that roof!

18:04.717 --> 18:06.217
I'm not keeping
a man up there.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.185
This is over!

18:07.187 --> 18:09.253
More than you realize! Look!

18:09.255 --> 18:12.256
We must've tapped
the relief well too late.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.257
That silo's
gonna go over!

18:13.259 --> 18:14.792
Get your man
out of there now!

18:14.794 --> 18:16.094
Joe, abort!

18:16.096 --> 18:18.429
Get off now! Abort!

18:18.431 --> 18:19.630
Oh, man.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.200
Chief!
(Metal creaking)

18:25.738 --> 18:29.207
Joe, don't move an inch
or the silo will fall

18:29.209 --> 18:30.875
into that sinkhole
with you in it!

18:30.877 --> 18:32.643
Along with those
chemicals.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.212
Which aren't getting
pumped out anymore,

18:34.214 --> 18:36.280
because the hose is
crimped under the silo.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.415
Not good.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.317
Sylvester:
<i> So...</i>

18:39.319 --> 18:41.419
Would you like to hear
my position

18:41.421 --> 18:43.221
on eminent domain abuse
in our fair city?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.722
No.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.225
Okay.

18:47.227 --> 18:50.728
It's interesting and has to do
with the supreme court case,

18:50.730 --> 18:53.231
<i>kelo v. The city of new London.</i>

18:53.233 --> 18:54.332
Listen, bozo,

18:54.334 --> 18:55.566
you ain't getting my vote.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.136
(Creaking, snapping)

18:59.305 --> 19:00.638
Oh, no.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.906
The rod broke!

19:01.908 --> 19:04.175
The 1920s steel
must have been corroded.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.644
(Grunts)
It's stuck.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.212
What do you mean
it's stuck?

19:08.214 --> 19:10.314
Do I have to define "stuck"
for you? It's oxidized,

19:10.316 --> 19:12.216
galvanized
and now compromised steel

19:12.218 --> 19:14.385
that's been warped
and stuck into place!

19:14.387 --> 19:17.321
(Grunts)

19:17.323 --> 19:20.291
No dice. It won't move.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.259
Cabe:
I'm here.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.527
Open it up.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.828
About that...

19:23.830 --> 19:26.197
(Gate rattles)
Are you kidding me?

19:26.199 --> 19:27.899
I got thousands of
gallons of water

19:27.901 --> 19:29.867
coming up on me fast.
It'll be on me in a minute!

19:29.869 --> 19:32.303
Sly, you got to get me out
of here or I'm gonna drown!

19:37.944 --> 19:40.912
(Grunts)

19:40.914 --> 19:42.580
It's no use.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.282
Cabe: We're running out of time
here, kid.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.683
You got to think
of something else.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.918
We have to cut it open.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.419
There's a power
saw on the truck,

19:48.421 --> 19:49.854
but there's no
electricity in here.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.491
Then we make our own energy.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.591
No time to explain.
Go grab the power saw,

19:54.594 --> 19:57.361
a screwdriver from your toolbox,
some oil and a lug-wrench.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.362
Cabe,

19:58.364 --> 19:59.363
we're gonna cut you out,

19:59.365 --> 20:00.464
but it could take a while.

20:00.466 --> 20:01.599
I don't have a while.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.733
The water's almost at my neck.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.468
I-i can see that.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.704
And by the time we're done
on my end,

20:06.706 --> 20:07.772
it's gonna be over your head.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.640
Wonderful.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.616
Hey.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.218
Everything you asked for.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.820
Okay, great. Do as i
say and do it quickly.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.706
Use the screwdriver

20:24.707 --> 20:26.591
to pry the access panel
off that old generator.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.459
Kid, what's the plan here?

20:28.461 --> 20:29.594
Sylvester:
This old well pump

20:29.596 --> 20:31.362
was retrofitted for electricity,

20:31.364 --> 20:33.631
but originally,
it was man-powered.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.633
Out of my way.
Okay.

20:35.635 --> 20:39.237
This wheel
is where the crank went and

20:39.239 --> 20:41.472
kinetic motion generated
a supply of energy

20:41.474 --> 20:43.741
by spinning a coil
of conductive wire

20:43.743 --> 20:45.509
around a magnet.

20:45.511 --> 20:46.744
Get the lug-wrench.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.579
Frank,

20:48.581 --> 20:50.314
you will be spinning this.

20:50.316 --> 20:51.482
Okay, out of my way.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.553
All right.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.687
Kid?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.389
Hurry up!

20:58.391 --> 20:59.657
Sylvester:
Frank?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.259
Spin the lug wrench
as fast as you can.

21:05.498 --> 21:08.566
Cabe, keep your fingers away
from the edge of the grate.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.739
Chief:
Just-just hold on up there, Joe.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.774
No big moves,
don't rock that boat.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.909
What if I try to reach you
through the silo's interior?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.711
That won't cause enough movement
to make it fall.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.447
Not an option-- the door's
pressed against the ground.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.982
He's got no exit.

21:24.983 --> 21:26.516
Then we need to
drill an escape hatch.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.519
No, the vibrations
will shake it, it'll fall.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.954
Also not an option.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.388
Fertilizer's made
with hydrochloric acid.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.291
There'll be some
inside the plant.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.359
We could use it to dissolve
the steel wall and then

21:35.361 --> 21:36.694
create an exit
without shaking the silo.

21:36.696 --> 21:37.895
Happy:
That'll take time.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.597
We'll have to
stabilize the silo

21:39.599 --> 21:40.998
or it'll fall in
before we're done.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.801
But how?
It's ready to topple right now.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.303
We secure it with cables.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.371
Cables?
Are you crazy?

21:47.373 --> 21:48.973
I'm about as crazy
as the Italian engineers

21:48.975 --> 21:51.842
who secured the leaning
tower of pisa for 645 years.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.312
Is that a good enough
of a test run for you?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.047
Okay-- oh, that was
a great history lesson, Walt.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.481
Italy sounds fun.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.482
Hey, chief,

21:58.484 --> 21:59.934
how about you and your men

21:59.935 --> 22:01.385
gather some cable so
we can secure the silo?

22:01.387 --> 22:03.654
Uh, we'll take care of the
acid in the fertilizer plant

22:03.656 --> 22:05.356
to cut through the
steel and get to Joe,

22:05.358 --> 22:07.525
and I'm gonna have a
quick word with Walter.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.926
(Sirens chirping)

22:11.564 --> 22:12.530
Hey, new rule:

22:12.532 --> 22:14.498
Don't talk to chief.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.535
This is great.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.770
Walt's a mess and the cops
and reporters are here.

22:19.772 --> 22:23.074
I hate to say it,
but we really need the waitress.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.444
(Veronica laughs)

22:26.446 --> 22:29.046
The look on
that guy's face

22:29.048 --> 22:31.015
when you threatened
to write him up was priceless.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.917
(Chuckles)
Almost as priceless as your face

22:32.919 --> 22:34.669
when I yelled at you.

22:34.670 --> 22:36.420
Seemed like your favorite part
of the con.

22:36.422 --> 22:37.421
Yep.

22:37.423 --> 22:38.889
It felt great.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.461
Today wasn't like
the old days.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.829
It was...

22:44.831 --> 22:46.697
Fun?

22:46.699 --> 22:51.001
I was going to say less
traumatic, but also fun.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.405
Now for something less fun.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.573
We're being followed.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.541
Okay, let's review the plan:

22:57.543 --> 23:01.045
After you take me
to union station,

23:01.047 --> 23:03.948
you file a complaint
with the da that I conned you

23:03.950 --> 23:06.717
and scorpion
out of some serious cash.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.920
That way the bad guys will think
you have no idea where I am,

23:09.922 --> 23:12.523
'cause I ripped you off,
and they'll leave you alone.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.158
And you're on a train
and off somewhere,

23:14.160 --> 23:15.993
and I never see you again.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.162
That's the way it's got to be.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.931
I know, i-i just wish
there was a better way.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.970
Constantly looking over your
shoulder isn't much of a life.

23:25.972 --> 23:30.174
Wait, is that genuine concern
for your mother?

23:30.176 --> 23:32.176
No, it's just
an observation.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.013
(Alert chimes)

23:39.085 --> 23:40.651
(Beep)
Read message.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.019
Automated voice:
Toby says,

23:42.021 --> 23:43.854
"Walter is at waltcon 2.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.723
"Dude is a dumpster fire.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.692
"Cops and reporters everywhere.
For more details,

23:48.694 --> 23:51.128
turn on kbx560."
(Beep)

23:51.130 --> 23:53.281
Reporter: ...The situation
at Colton's central

23:53.282 --> 23:55.433
fertilizer plant, where a
massive sinkhole is on the verge

23:55.435 --> 23:57.001
of toppling
a chemical storage silo

23:57.003 --> 23:58.636
with a worker trapped inside.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.070
The pit is deep and unstable.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.739
And if the silo falls,

24:01.741 --> 24:03.741
authorities believe the worker
will be unrecoverable.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.176
Oh, my god,
we got to get there.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.944
Text Toby.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.512
We're on our way.
(Beep)

24:08.514 --> 24:09.980
What about the company
following us?

24:09.982 --> 24:11.882
Let 'em follow.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.753
All right,
we're making some progress.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.955
Just hold on!

24:17.956 --> 24:20.156
I got one last big breath
and I'm under, kid.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.960
I'll have you out of there in
less than a minute. Trust me.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.463
(Gasps)

24:25.465 --> 24:26.897
Faster!

24:32.972 --> 24:34.138
He's losing consciousness!

24:37.143 --> 24:39.109
No, it broke!
Okay.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.780
Come on!

24:42.782 --> 24:44.048
(Both grunt)

24:48.621 --> 24:50.154
(Cabe groaning)
Cabe!

24:50.156 --> 24:53.224
Oh, cabe, all right...

24:54.861 --> 24:56.026
(Panting)
You okay?

24:56.028 --> 24:57.628
You okay, cabe?

24:57.630 --> 24:58.762
I'm all right.

24:58.764 --> 24:59.763
Good work.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.098
Thanks.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.200
(Sylvester panting)

25:03.202 --> 25:05.102
All right.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.270
You got my vote.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.006
(Both chuckle)

25:12.178 --> 25:13.210
It's going over!

25:13.212 --> 25:14.778
It's falling!

25:14.780 --> 25:15.813
Gun it!

25:15.815 --> 25:17.882
(Engine revs)

25:19.886 --> 25:21.018
It's steady at 15 degrees.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.152
Keep the engine running.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.289
It's holding,
but who knows for how long?

25:25.291 --> 25:26.724
What's your eta?

25:26.726 --> 25:27.925
Well, the steel's thicker
than I thought;

25:27.927 --> 25:29.159
might not get through
in time.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.828
See, the more the silo tilts,

25:30.830 --> 25:32.997
the more the pounds per
square inch of pressure

25:32.999 --> 25:34.231
the trucks need
to counterbalance,

25:34.233 --> 25:35.966
and with their horsepower,

25:35.968 --> 25:38.135
if the silo drops even
four degrees more,

25:38.137 --> 25:39.587
it falls.

25:39.588 --> 25:41.038
I won't lose another
one of my guys.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.139
We can't let this happen.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.141
What are you doing?

25:44.143 --> 25:46.577
I don't engage in
futile endeavors.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.679
I'll never get through
the steel in time.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.214
You're not quitting on my guy!

25:50.216 --> 25:51.849
I am trying to
save your guy,

25:51.851 --> 25:53.817
but my best chance is
for you to leave me alone

25:53.819 --> 25:55.019
and let me think.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.121
Chief:
There is no time to think.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.056
If we don't do something soon,

25:59.058 --> 26:01.058
it's the same
as letting him fall!

26:03.029 --> 26:04.828
That's it.

26:04.830 --> 26:05.863
We let him fall.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.348
I am so sorry.

26:07.349 --> 26:08.832
Some of the acid
must've fallen on his head

26:08.834 --> 26:10.384
and it's eating
his brain.

26:10.385 --> 26:11.935
Those safety nets you have,
we tie them together,

26:11.938 --> 26:13.070
we stretch them
across the sinkhole,

26:13.072 --> 26:15.423
we cut the cables,

26:15.424 --> 26:17.775
we let the silo drop onto
the nets and catch it,

26:17.777 --> 26:18.876
and then Joe
gets out to safety.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.078
Those nets are designed
to catch people,

26:21.080 --> 26:22.646
not buildings.

26:22.647 --> 26:24.213
If we tie them with the
right amount of give,

26:24.216 --> 26:26.150
it might flex
just the right amount and hold.

26:26.152 --> 26:27.985
You know what else
they<i> might</i> do?

26:27.987 --> 26:31.922
Break and send the kid
plummeting to his death.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.424
Get out of my way.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.925
This is the only way to save
your worker.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.360
If you had my IQ,
you'd understand,

26:36.362 --> 26:38.729
but I suppose you're okay
with losing another man.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.144
Why does this keep
happening to me?

26:54.146 --> 26:55.879
'Cause you suck
at talking to people.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.283
You got to convince
the chief to do your plan.

26:59.285 --> 27:03.988
Now, Paige gave you some tools
to be a quasi-human.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.289
You just got to use them.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.968
I... I stated facts

27:17.970 --> 27:20.738
when I should have
considered your feelings.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.107
I was unintentionally
insensitive.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.376
I've been insensitive
my whole life.

27:26.946 --> 27:29.813
But I know how you feel

27:29.815 --> 27:33.417
because i-I've lost somebody
who was close to me, too.

27:36.222 --> 27:40.958
I believe in my plan,
but time is short.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.265
How many nets do you need?

27:59.211 --> 28:00.678
Okay, we're ready.

28:00.680 --> 28:01.879
Hold on, Joe.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.280
Ready!

28:03.282 --> 28:05.683
Okay, on three,
cut the cables.

28:05.685 --> 28:06.984
One,

28:06.986 --> 28:08.352
two...

28:08.354 --> 28:10.854
Three!

28:10.856 --> 28:12.456
(Cables snap and whip,
silo creaks)

28:17.730 --> 28:19.129
(Silo creaking)

28:24.303 --> 28:25.402
Nothing but net!

28:25.404 --> 28:28.706
Joe, hurry up and
get out of there.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.741
Joe, come in.

28:30.743 --> 28:31.942
Joe!

28:31.944 --> 28:35.012
I can't... stand.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.980
My leg's broken.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.415
Hold tight!

28:38.417 --> 28:39.883
Help's on the way!

28:39.885 --> 28:42.419
He's hurt, but he's okay.
(Loud creak)

28:42.421 --> 28:44.788
Or not.
Chief:
What the hell was that?

28:44.790 --> 28:47.057
The silo's fracturing. We have
to get him off of there now!

28:49.095 --> 28:50.728
Happy: Adding a couple
hundred pounds to this mess

28:50.730 --> 28:52.396
might not be the best
way to stay alive.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.398
Move fast.
(Car horn honks)

28:56.168 --> 28:57.835
(Vehicle pulls up)

29:01.207 --> 29:03.774
What the hell is going on here?

29:03.776 --> 29:06.877
Silo, man trapped,
Walter on top with sandhog.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.812
Up to speed.

29:08.814 --> 29:09.847
Walter:
I see him!

29:14.019 --> 29:16.787
Okay, here we go.
Chief: No, wait, wait, wait,
wait, he's my man, I'll go.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.188
No, you need to pull him up.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.057
You have more upper
body strength than I do.

29:20.059 --> 29:23.026
Not a lot of square footage on
that box for a clean landing.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.462
(Quietly):
One, two...

29:25.464 --> 29:27.364
(Grunts)

29:27.366 --> 29:29.800
No!
(Walter groans)

29:30.970 --> 29:33.070
Chief: Grab Joe's hand
and pull yourself up.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.840
(Both groan)

29:42.982 --> 29:43.981
Walter:
Okay, here, here.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.466
Grab onto my shoulder.

29:45.467 --> 29:46.950
Push yourself up with
your good leg, yeah, great.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.552
Okay, now turn around.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.220
Yeah, here we are.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.455
Grab hold of him.
You got him?

29:51.457 --> 29:52.890
I got him. Frank?

29:52.892 --> 29:55.826
(Walter grunts)

29:55.828 --> 29:57.895
(People clamoring)

30:01.567 --> 30:03.300
What the hell happened here?

30:03.302 --> 30:06.003
I left Walter in charge.

30:07.907 --> 30:08.939
Let 'em in!

30:08.941 --> 30:10.274
I'm sorry...

30:10.276 --> 30:11.575
Wait.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.979
They won't try to get past
the cops, but they'll be waiting

30:15.981 --> 30:19.216
for me when I leave.
We'll deal with them later.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.422
That silo looks like
it's about to give!

30:25.424 --> 30:27.925
Shake a tail feather, fellas!

30:32.031 --> 30:34.097
Let's go!
Let's go! Get it in gear!

30:36.168 --> 30:38.168
Paige:
What the hell happened?

30:38.170 --> 30:40.370
I thought you guys came in
to fix a leak in a pipe.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.472
Cabe: Nice and easy, chief.
I'm spotting you.

30:42.474 --> 30:44.908
Toby: Easy now, no pressure
on that leg.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.009
Let's get you seated.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.544
Ambulance is on its way.

30:49.415 --> 30:50.914
(Crack and hiss)

30:53.052 --> 30:55.118
That's not
environmentally friendly.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.920
The chemicals are in.

30:56.922 --> 30:58.288
Permeation rates
in this type of geology,

30:58.290 --> 30:59.923
we're talking less than
30 minutes until they reach

30:59.925 --> 31:01.391
the aquifer
and contaminate it.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.961
How do you stop liquid
that's already in a sinkhole?

31:03.963 --> 31:05.529
Trick question, you can't.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.096
We're screwed.
California's screwed.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.001
If you're gonna think
of something,

31:11.003 --> 31:12.035
you better do it fast, Walt.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.403
I'm trying to find a solution.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.538
Pestering doesn't help.

31:14.540 --> 31:15.973
Paige:
Is anyone

31:15.975 --> 31:17.975
gonna fill me in on
that second black eye?

31:18.944 --> 31:21.011
Yeah, Walt had another incident

31:21.013 --> 31:22.780
like the one this morning,
where he got

31:22.781 --> 31:24.548
in a fight over frequent
guest punch cards.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.551
You mean those cards where
you get one punch per visit?

31:27.553 --> 31:31.154
It's one punch per purchase.
And now's not the time...

31:32.925 --> 31:35.192
Wait a minute, yes, it is.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.160
It... it's time
for the cello shell-o!

31:37.162 --> 31:39.296
I love a good fro-yo
as much as the next guy,

31:39.298 --> 31:41.031
but it's kind of bad form
to get dessert

31:41.033 --> 31:42.633
while Southern California's
being poisoned.

31:42.635 --> 31:45.202
No. A-a hardening shell. That's
how we prevent the chemicals

31:45.204 --> 31:47.671
from getting into the aquifer.
The sandhogs were fixing

31:47.673 --> 31:50.107
the leak with mortar made
with calcium hydroxide.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.075
They have bags of it
in the tunnel.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.311
And the fertilizer
chemicals contain fluoride.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.979
Calcium hydroxide plus fluoride

31:55.981 --> 31:57.981
will harden that chemical sludge
like cement.

31:57.983 --> 31:59.416
Or like a cello shell-o.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.074
Happy:
Once it solidifies,

32:01.075 --> 32:02.731
it won't be able to
seep into the aquifer.

32:02.732 --> 32:04.388
Exactly! Now we need something
to mix the solution.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.156
I saw just the thing in the
plant, but I'll need help.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.457
Doc, come on!

32:07.459 --> 32:09.960
We'll get the bags of mortar.

32:09.962 --> 32:13.196
Walter. We have a moment.
You and I need to talk.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.602
Happy:
These turbines will churn up

32:18.604 --> 32:20.971
the solution like a cake mixer,

32:20.972 --> 32:23.339
so the calcium hydroxide will
react faster with the fluoride.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.975
Toby:
Speeding up the hardening

32:24.977 --> 32:27.110
of the cello shell-o
over the aquifer.

32:28.314 --> 32:30.280
All right. That's the last
of the mortar.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.115
Let's mix this cake batter!

32:32.117 --> 32:33.283
(Whirring)

32:35.287 --> 32:37.688
Cabe:
Give 'em some juice!

32:40.192 --> 32:42.592
It's working.
The shell is forming!

32:42.594 --> 32:44.494
It's thickening.
In a few minutes, it'll be

32:44.496 --> 32:47.130
hard as rock, and then a Hazmat
team can come in to remove

32:47.132 --> 32:49.166
the toxic material
piece by piece.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.208
Walter, be careful. Your foot...

32:58.210 --> 32:59.409
(Screams)
(Shouting)
Mom!

33:05.317 --> 33:08.352
Today's sinkhole disaster
turned tragic when Los Angeles

33:08.354 --> 33:10.620
entrepreneur Veronica dineen
fell to her death

33:10.622 --> 33:14.024
into a caustic toxic soup which
was in the process of hardening

33:14.026 --> 33:17.027
to prevent seeping
into a major socal aquifer.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.762
Authorities believe her body
will never be...

33:25.771 --> 33:28.305
I'm worried about her
being alone right now.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.674
We're right here
if she needs us.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.743
She can handle this.

33:59.671 --> 34:03.407
I was surprised
you took my call.

34:03.409 --> 34:06.610
You're harassing me
hours after my mother's death,

34:06.612 --> 34:09.780
so it's clear you...
Aren't going away

34:09.782 --> 34:12.082
until we have it out, so...

34:12.084 --> 34:14.818
What the hell do you want?

34:21.660 --> 34:23.560
My money.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.395
You were there.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.498
You saw her fall into the
sinkhole with her briefcase.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.101
That money got just as eaten up
by the acidic chemicals

34:31.103 --> 34:32.335
as my mother.

34:32.337 --> 34:35.605
Did see that.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.441
But here's the thing.

34:37.443 --> 34:40.277
Her debts are now yours.

34:43.115 --> 34:46.516
Let me tell you my situation.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.119
I'm a single mom who waitressed

34:49.121 --> 34:51.321
up until two
and a half years ago.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.657
I make less
than six figures a year,

34:53.659 --> 34:55.492
I have four grand
in my bank account.

34:55.494 --> 34:58.261
You want to set up
a payment plan? Fine.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.831
You'll be whole by 2094.

35:00.833 --> 35:04.701
And why should I believe you?

35:04.703 --> 35:07.671
You can believe
whatever you like.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.740
But if you don't mind,
I'd like to be left alone now.

35:10.742 --> 35:14.478
Because as much
as I'm nothing like my mom,

35:14.480 --> 35:18.315
because she was selfish
and unreliable,

35:18.317 --> 35:20.150
she was my mother.

35:20.152 --> 35:23.186
And I loved her,
and I'll miss her.

35:23.188 --> 35:24.354
So, please

35:24.356 --> 35:27.591
let me grieve.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.155
Clear!

36:00.459 --> 36:01.925
(Exhales)

36:01.927 --> 36:04.461
Finally. I could smell
his Cologne from in there.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.163
I thought he'd never leave.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.699
Go ahead. Bad guy's gone.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.805
(Gasps)

36:15.807 --> 36:17.841
Ralph! Honey! Oh.

36:18.911 --> 36:20.510
Ah...

36:20.512 --> 36:21.811
I want to know
how you did it.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.513
Happy wouldn't
tell me.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.815
Master plan should come
from the architect.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.185
Actually,
it was your mom's idea.

36:28.187 --> 36:29.553
Well, Ralph,

36:29.555 --> 36:31.922
I didn't want grandma
to be on the run her whole life.

36:31.924 --> 36:34.958
Reporter: The pit is deep and
unstable, and if the silo falls,

36:34.960 --> 36:37.427
authorities believe the worker
will be unrecoverable.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.229
Paige:
<i> That's when I got the idea.</i>

36:39.231 --> 36:41.765
Walter. We have a moment.
You and I need to talk.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.700
Oh. I assume you've heard
I've been misbehaving.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.268
Uh, yeah. We can deal
with that later.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.970
But I need you to
help save my mom?

36:46.972 --> 36:49.940
Can you get any more of
those big sandhog nets?

36:49.942 --> 36:52.242
Paige:<i> We set up the net</i>
<i> in the broken part of the pipe</i>

36:52.244 --> 36:54.377
<i> that went into the sinkhole.</i>

36:54.379 --> 36:56.980
<i> Walter stood</i>
<i> in his predetermined spot,</i>

36:56.982 --> 36:59.683
<i> and once we knew</i>
<i>the chemical mix was hardening,</i>

36:59.685 --> 37:02.285
<i> he slipped his foot</i>
<i> under the extension cord,</i>

37:02.287 --> 37:03.420
Veronica:
<i> I did the rest...</i>

37:03.422 --> 37:05.455
<i> All for the benefit of my pals</i>

37:05.457 --> 37:06.756
<i> who were watching</i>
<i> from close by.</i>

37:06.758 --> 37:08.892
Walter. Be careful. Your foot...

37:08.894 --> 37:10.594
(Screams)
(Shouting)

37:10.596 --> 37:12.262
Son of a bitch.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.296
Our money.

37:22.241 --> 37:25.675
Veronica:<i> Thanks to one hell</i>
<i> of a con by my little girl,</i>

37:25.677 --> 37:27.244
I am now free and clear.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.379
Speaking of which,

37:29.381 --> 37:31.915
I have a new birth certificate,
driver's license

37:31.917 --> 37:33.483
and social security card.

37:33.485 --> 37:36.419
They're real mccoys,
so you won't have any problems.

37:36.421 --> 37:40.290
I... don't know what to say

37:40.292 --> 37:41.391
to all of you.

37:41.393 --> 37:44.027
(Chuckles softly)
Thank you.

37:44.029 --> 37:47.030
It's nothing.
We make fake ids all the time.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.665
No.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.968
Thank you for...

37:51.970 --> 37:54.971
Giving my daughter
something that I couldn't.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.006
A family.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.042
Ralph, honey.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.811
I'm gonna have
to keep a low profile.

38:01.813 --> 38:04.714
Otherwise I'd insist
that you and I stay pen pals.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.883
You don't get off that easily.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.518
I built an encrypted
ID scrambler

38:08.520 --> 38:10.053
so we can e-mail each other.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.022
Of course you did.

38:14.293 --> 38:15.525
And Walter.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.860
What you did today,

38:16.862 --> 38:19.929
with your cello shell-o trick

38:19.931 --> 38:22.599
at the sinkhole,
was very impressive.

38:22.601 --> 38:23.700
Oh. Thank you.

38:23.702 --> 38:26.036
That's the thing
about real chemistry.

38:26.038 --> 38:27.604
If you have
the right ingredients,

38:27.606 --> 38:29.372
you just need to be patient,

38:29.374 --> 38:32.375
and... eventually
everything will work out.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.811
Real subtle.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.582
(Whispers): Keep working
at it, Pinocchio.

38:39.584 --> 38:42.652
Someday you'll be a real boy.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.721
I can feel it.

38:48.794 --> 38:51.027
(Exhaling):
Well.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.997
This is it, so...

38:53.999 --> 38:56.499
All right. We should
all get back to work.

38:56.501 --> 38:57.500
We don't have any work.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.568
Read between the lines.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.503
Beat it so they can talk alone.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.038
Oh.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.381
I heard that nice thing
you said about me.

39:11.383 --> 39:13.550
Oh, to the man who was trying
to kill you? Yeah.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.884
Don't let it go to your head.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.486
They were just for the con.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.054
Well, in order
for a con to work,

39:18.056 --> 39:19.556
you have to believe
what you're saying.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.392
Maybe I believed some of it.

39:22.394 --> 39:24.461
I'll take that as a win.

39:25.831 --> 39:29.366
Just because I can't
seem to change for you,

39:29.368 --> 39:31.067
doesn't mean that Walter can't.

39:31.069 --> 39:34.938
I don't care for him
in that way anymore, mom.

39:35.907 --> 39:39.109
Now you're just conning
yourself.

39:41.413 --> 39:42.946
I'll miss you.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.685
I always miss you.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.492
(Sniffles)

40:02.968 --> 40:04.401
Mom.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.405
My car keys.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.509
I figured homeland
would reimburse you.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.048
Good-bye, mom.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.118
Good-bye, sweetheart.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.854
Oh, and, um,
check your desk drawer.

40:24.856 --> 40:27.557
I left you a little something.
(Chuckles)

40:27.559 --> 40:28.892
Okay.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.538
(Exhales)

40:57.022 --> 40:58.822
"Dear Paige,

40:58.824 --> 41:00.990
"i know you've never taken
any of my ill-gotten gains.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.792
"But this is for Ralph.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.830
"Tell him a con's not over
until grandma says it's over."

41:07.766 --> 41:09.833
Love, mom."

41:23.748 --> 41:26.516
Guys? I'm gonna need help
opening an offshore account.
