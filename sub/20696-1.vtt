See ya at my place at 10.

01:06.938 --> 01:07.905
Hey babe.

01:09.374 --> 01:11.175
I'm heading home now.

01:12.210 --> 01:13.777
Just some friends.

01:16.014 --> 01:18.382
No, not tonight, I'm just gonna head home,

01:18.384 --> 01:21.552
but I'll just see you tomorrow, okay?

01:22.887 --> 01:23.787
You too.

01:33.998 --> 01:34.898
Shit.

01:58.823 --> 02:00.057
Someone there?

02:44.303 --> 02:46.670
Thanks for having me up here.

02:46.672 --> 02:49.006
It's really great to finally meet you.

02:49.008 --> 02:51.775
It's great to have you here,
we'd heard so much about you.

02:51.777 --> 02:53.777
All good things, I hope.

02:53.779 --> 02:55.412
No, all terrible.

03:25.777 --> 03:29.179
So Ryan, Sarah tells us that
you work in the movies.

03:29.181 --> 03:30.414
That's right.

03:30.416 --> 03:31.615
Oh, anything that we may have seen?

03:31.617 --> 03:34.318
I'm just starting out, so,

03:34.320 --> 03:35.219
not yet.

05:08.713 --> 05:09.980
Hey, we're gonna run to the store

05:09.982 --> 05:11.815
and stop at the coffee
shop, you wanna come?

05:11.817 --> 05:13.483
No, we're good.

05:13.485 --> 05:14.785
Do you want us to bring you back anything?

05:14.787 --> 05:17.521
- No thanks.
- Are you sure?

05:17.523 --> 05:18.989
They're fine, honey.

05:18.991 --> 05:20.190
We won't be long.

05:20.192 --> 05:22.125
You sure you don't want anything?

05:22.127 --> 05:23.794
- Yes, mother.
- Just checking.

05:23.796 --> 05:24.895
- Just want to make sure.
- Let's go.

05:24.897 --> 05:27.397
- Do you have the keys?
- Yes, honey.

05:27.399 --> 05:28.298
Bye.

05:54.660 --> 05:55.625
Here we go.

06:00.398 --> 06:01.865
I'll handle this.

06:06.771 --> 06:07.804
Hi, sheriff.

06:10.743 --> 06:14.044
Got the whole family up here with ya?

06:16.781 --> 06:18.949
Up for the holidays, huh?

06:20.084 --> 06:23.387
Come on, Hank, we do this every year.

06:23.389 --> 06:24.621
Nice photo.

06:24.623 --> 06:26.089
There a reason you pulled me over?

06:26.091 --> 06:29.626
Just like to know who's
going through my town.

06:32.897 --> 06:33.797
We done?

06:36.534 --> 06:38.101
Have a nice day.

06:45.843 --> 06:48.011
I can't stand that guy.

07:05.329 --> 07:06.730
Okay.

07:06.732 --> 07:07.697
You coming?

07:07.699 --> 07:10.233
Nope.

07:10.235 --> 07:11.134
Come on.

07:12.136 --> 07:13.370
I'll stay here.

07:13.372 --> 07:14.337
All right, do you want anything?

07:14.339 --> 07:15.572
Surprise me.

07:15.574 --> 07:16.740
Oh, okay, don't set me up for that,

07:16.742 --> 07:19.876
I always know I'm gonna fail.

07:19.878 --> 07:21.678
Miss you already.

07:25.383 --> 07:27.684
See ya in a couple of days.

07:37.295 --> 07:40.430
What am I supposed to do with this?

07:49.006 --> 07:51.041
Oh, you're gonna duct tape it?

07:51.043 --> 07:53.810
You got a better idea?

07:53.812 --> 07:54.911
It's your camera.

07:54.913 --> 07:56.713
Hold it right here.

08:00.251 --> 08:01.485
Perfect.

08:01.487 --> 08:04.387
Steady.

08:14.665 --> 08:16.233
Come on, let's go.

08:21.907 --> 08:22.806
Woo hoo!

08:29.113 --> 08:30.013
Hi!

08:32.049 --> 08:33.450
- Hi.
- Hi, Jane.

08:34.585 --> 08:36.285
I heard you guys were in town.

08:36.288 --> 08:37.754
You did?

08:37.756 --> 08:40.490
Well, you know small
towns, word travels fast.

08:40.491 --> 08:42.859
So how long are you guys up here this year?

08:42.861 --> 08:44.227
Probably just through Christmas.

08:44.229 --> 08:46.329
Sarah's gotta get back to California.

08:46.331 --> 08:48.164
Aw, what a shame.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.599
How is she?

08:49.601 --> 08:51.935
She's good, she brought her boyfriend home.

08:51.937 --> 08:54.571
We'd never met him before this.

08:54.573 --> 08:55.805
Boyfriend?

08:55.807 --> 08:57.374
I didn't know she had a boyfriend.

08:57.376 --> 08:59.876
Yeah, almost a year.

08:59.878 --> 09:02.012
Well that's wonderful.

09:02.014 --> 09:04.848
- How's Tyler?
- Oh, he's great!

09:04.850 --> 09:06.650
He was asking about Sarah the other day,

09:06.652 --> 09:10.253
wanted to know why she hadn't
been up here to visit.

09:10.255 --> 09:12.155
Remember when they were kids?

09:12.157 --> 09:14.391
They were practically joined at the hip.

09:14.393 --> 09:17.360
I know, it's crazy how fast time flies.

09:17.362 --> 09:20.931
Next thing you know, they're on their own.

09:29.740 --> 09:30.907
Stop, stop.

09:34.045 --> 09:34.945
What?

09:42.554 --> 09:44.788
Looks like boot prints.

09:44.790 --> 09:45.922
So it does.

09:47.224 --> 09:48.558
That's weird.

09:49.794 --> 09:50.694
Why?

09:51.495 --> 09:54.798
Because we only just got here.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.035
Well, you know, may be your
dad or something, right?

10:00.671 --> 10:01.571
Sarah?

10:02.907 --> 10:06.142
Come on, you're way over-thinking this.

10:07.345 --> 10:08.178
- Good?
- Mm-hmm.

10:08.180 --> 10:09.079
Okay.

10:13.184 --> 10:14.918
All aboard.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.819
Let's go.

10:19.423 --> 10:21.091
- Ready?
- Yeah.

10:24.196 --> 10:25.862
Oh, perfect.

10:28.667 --> 10:31.601
Hey, Carl.

10:31.603 --> 10:32.902
Merry Christmas.

10:32.904 --> 10:33.803
Hi.

10:36.474 --> 10:39.142
Thanks for plowing our driveway for us.

10:39.144 --> 10:40.944
Happy I could help.

10:42.279 --> 10:44.180
So you have any special
plans for Christmas?

10:44.182 --> 10:47.017
Yeah, I'm not much of a holiday person.

10:47.019 --> 10:50.954
Well, you should stop
by the cabin sometime.

10:50.956 --> 10:53.023
Oh, I don't wanna be a bother.

10:53.025 --> 10:54.691
- Nonsense.
- Okay.

10:56.327 --> 10:57.994
Well, maybe, maybe.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.566
Thanks again for helping.

11:03.568 --> 11:05.001
Hey, don't mention it, Natalie.

11:05.003 --> 11:05.902
Okay.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.840
Hi-ya!

11:15.613 --> 11:16.513
Woo!

11:24.789 --> 11:25.989
Woo!

11:41.605 --> 11:43.873
My dad caught a muskie over
there a few summers ago.

11:43.875 --> 11:44.774
Really?

11:45.676 --> 11:48.078
- It's a fish.
- I knew that.

11:52.650 --> 11:54.684
I just love it out here.

11:54.686 --> 11:56.086
It's gorgeous.

11:58.622 --> 12:01.691
You know, I was really nervous
to meet your parents.

12:01.693 --> 12:03.093
Why?

12:03.095 --> 12:05.195
It's a big step.

12:05.197 --> 12:08.898
I'm really glad you brought
me out here though.

12:08.900 --> 12:09.799
Me too.

12:16.574 --> 12:18.408
What are you doing?

12:18.410 --> 12:20.610
Sarah Marie...
- yes.

12:20.612 --> 12:22.779
- Yes.
- You gotta let me finish.

12:22.781 --> 12:25.482
Okay, I'm sorry, go ahead.

12:25.484 --> 12:26.382
Sarah,

12:27.818 --> 12:29.919
I knew from the first moment that I met you

12:29.921 --> 12:32.922
that I was gonna spend the
rest of my life with you.

12:32.924 --> 12:36.559
Not only are you the smartest, funniest,

12:36.561 --> 12:38.928
most beautiful pain in
the ass I've ever met,

12:41.433 --> 12:44.634
But you're also my best friend.

12:44.636 --> 12:47.470
And I can't think of anything more amazing

12:47.472 --> 12:51.141
than spending the rest of my life with you.

12:53.110 --> 12:54.477
Will you marry me?

12:57.115 --> 12:58.181
Oh my god.

13:00.518 --> 13:01.651
- Oh my god.
- Yes?

13:01.653 --> 13:02.919
Yes,

13:02.921 --> 13:03.920
yes!

13:03.922 --> 13:06.089
- I love you.
- I love you.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.439
Morning, sheriff.
- Two cups of coffee to go

13:23.441 --> 13:25.575
and a blueberry scone.

13:25.577 --> 13:29.145
Now Hank, you shouldn't
be eating that stuff.

13:29.147 --> 13:30.814
It's gonna weigh you down.

13:30.816 --> 13:33.216
You sound like my ex wife.

13:34.819 --> 13:39.088
Well she was right, I'll be right back.

13:48.799 --> 13:52.335
- Keep the change.
- Well thank you.

13:52.337 --> 13:54.404
You two have a good day.

13:58.609 --> 13:59.876
He's such an ass.

13:59.878 --> 14:01.878
I heard he's gonna be retiring soon.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.013
We'll be better for it.

14:21.198 --> 14:22.131
Hey!

14:22.133 --> 14:23.299
We got locked out.

14:23.301 --> 14:25.335
Aw, I hope you weren't waiting long.

14:25.337 --> 14:26.603
No, not long at all.

14:26.605 --> 14:28.972
Here, let's get you in.

14:28.974 --> 14:31.174
Okay, I'll be quick.

14:31.176 --> 14:32.242
There we go.

14:36.714 --> 14:41.384
Hey, did you guys take the spare key?

14:41.386 --> 14:42.819
- Greg?
- Hmm?

14:42.821 --> 14:45.321
Do you have the spare key?

14:45.323 --> 14:46.222
No.

14:47.024 --> 14:49.459
It wasn't in the garage.

14:49.461 --> 14:50.827
I'm sure he has it somewhere.

14:50.829 --> 14:54.230
Can't remember anything anymore.

14:54.232 --> 14:56.232
You guys were gone for a while.

14:56.234 --> 15:00.303
Your mom and a few people
in the coffee shop.

15:00.305 --> 15:02.071
Did you guys eat?

15:02.073 --> 15:04.140
- Not hungry.
- I'm good.

15:06.877 --> 15:09.279
- Hey mom, guess what.
- What?

15:15.619 --> 15:16.519
Oh my god!

15:19.758 --> 15:21.658
Honey, congratulations!

15:21.660 --> 15:23.893
Aw, thanks, mom.

15:25.462 --> 15:27.864
I'm so happy for you both.

15:30.134 --> 15:31.834
Well, we need to celebrate.

15:31.836 --> 15:32.936
I'm gonna make a huge dinner tonight.

15:32.938 --> 15:34.304
Anything you want.

15:34.306 --> 15:35.505
Mom, you don't have to do that.

15:35.507 --> 15:37.507
Oh, nonsense, what are you in the mood for?

15:37.509 --> 15:40.410
Nevermind, I'm gonna surprise you.

15:42.846 --> 15:44.580
Congratulations, honey.

15:44.582 --> 15:46.382
Thanks dad.

15:59.764 --> 16:03.933
I gotta go get the Christmas
tree out of the garage.

16:15.612 --> 16:17.580
- Hi!
- Merry Christmas!

16:17.582 --> 16:19.148
Merry Christmas!

16:20.951 --> 16:22.285
Is it cold enough for ya out there?

16:22.287 --> 16:24.854
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:24.856 --> 16:26.289
- Good to see you.
- You too.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.957
Where's Sarah?
- She's in her room with Ryan.

16:27.959 --> 16:30.026
Sarah, come on out here!

16:34.264 --> 16:35.331
Hi guys.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.799
- Hi!
- Hi.

16:36.801 --> 16:38.768
- How ya doin'?
- Oh, we're just doing great.

16:38.770 --> 16:40.470
- Tyler, how's it going?
- Great.

16:40.472 --> 16:42.105
Oh, long time no see.

16:42.107 --> 16:44.107
Yeah, work's been kinda crazy.

16:44.109 --> 16:46.442
I'm sure it's pretty nonstop over there.

16:46.444 --> 16:47.677
Who's this?

16:47.679 --> 16:49.712
This is Sarah's boyfriend Ryan.

16:49.714 --> 16:52.215
Well, not boyfriend any more.

16:54.251 --> 16:57.820
Oh my goodness.

16:57.822 --> 16:59.922
Congratulations.

16:59.924 --> 17:02.458
- This is such good news.
- Thank you.

17:02.460 --> 17:05.395
Wow, yeah, that's amazing.

17:05.396 --> 17:07.030
Would you guys like to stay for dinner?

17:07.031 --> 17:09.098
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Oh, we'd love to,

17:09.099 --> 17:11.567
but we've already eaten at the cafe.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.569
We really just stopped by to give you this.

17:13.570 --> 17:15.304
Jane, you didn't have to do that.

17:15.306 --> 17:18.074
Stop, it's Christmas.

17:18.076 --> 17:19.474
Thank you.

17:19.477 --> 17:21.711
Well hey, it was great seeing you.

17:21.713 --> 17:23.146
You know what?

17:23.147 --> 17:24.781
I have a show tomorrow night at nine

17:24.782 --> 17:27.116
so you two should come by,
it'll be a good time.

17:27.117 --> 17:29.152
I'm a singer, songwriter.

17:29.154 --> 17:30.319
Course you are.

17:30.321 --> 17:32.655
- Yeah, we'd love to.
- Yeah?

17:32.657 --> 17:36.192
Okay, great, awesome, then
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:36.194 --> 17:38.661
Hey, and congrats again.

17:38.663 --> 17:40.129
- Thank you.
- Yeah, congratulations.

17:40.131 --> 17:42.165
- Thanks guys.
- Merry Christmas.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.834
- Merry Christmas.
- Drive safe.

17:47.538 --> 17:51.007
Well, Tyler won't be calling you anymore.

18:01.351 --> 18:03.786
Aren't you gonna open it?

18:03.788 --> 18:06.189
I feel kinda guilty I
didn't get them anything.

18:06.191 --> 18:09.392
We'll just get them something later.

18:09.394 --> 18:10.460
I suppose.

18:22.005 --> 18:24.740
It's cute.

18:24.742 --> 18:26.309
It is.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.217
They seem nice.

19:09.319 --> 19:10.720
They're great.

19:15.659 --> 19:16.559
So...

19:18.295 --> 19:21.664
What's the deal with you and Tyler?

19:21.666 --> 19:24.300
Tyler and I grew up together.

19:24.302 --> 19:25.368
That's it?

19:29.773 --> 19:32.608
Before I left for California...

19:34.444 --> 19:35.511
We hung out.

19:36.780 --> 19:40.016
One thing just sort of led to another.

19:41.852 --> 19:43.319
Right.

19:43.321 --> 19:46.155
It was just a silly summer
fling, nothing serious.

19:46.157 --> 19:47.056
Sure.

19:49.259 --> 19:50.159
Ryan.

19:51.595 --> 19:54.163
Tyler and I were best friends.

19:55.532 --> 19:57.934
Funny, you never mentioned him.

19:57.936 --> 19:59.302
When did this end?

19:59.304 --> 20:01.871
Technically, no one ended it.

20:01.873 --> 20:03.539
But we both knew that nothing serious

20:03.541 --> 20:06.008
would ever happen between us.

20:09.346 --> 20:10.947
Ryan,

20:10.949 --> 20:11.847
I'm yours.

20:12.983 --> 20:15.952
Okay, nothing can ever change that.

20:18.789 --> 20:22.425
Let's just leave the past where it belongs.

20:23.460 --> 20:24.360
Okay?

20:27.998 --> 20:28.898
I dunno.

20:30.267 --> 20:33.302
I mean, it was kinda convincing.

20:33.304 --> 20:34.937
What do you mean?

20:35.939 --> 20:38.407
Oh my god, shut up.

20:38.409 --> 20:39.308
Oh my god.

20:41.245 --> 20:43.879
Okay, all I'm saying is that they've only

20:43.881 --> 20:46.349
known each other a year and
now they're getting married,

20:46.351 --> 20:48.351
I mean, don't you think
that's a little sudden?

20:48.353 --> 20:52.455
They're in love, honey, that's
what people in love do.

20:52.457 --> 20:53.956
Well, we don't even know this guy.

20:53.958 --> 20:54.991
I mean, how's he gonna support her?

20:54.993 --> 20:57.526
He doesn't even have a real job.

20:57.528 --> 20:59.128
Come on Greg, you and I both know

20:59.130 --> 21:01.464
that doesn't mean anything.

21:01.466 --> 21:05.268
It'll mean something when
they can't pay the rent.

21:05.270 --> 21:07.270
Just try to make an effort.

21:07.272 --> 21:08.170
Please?

21:22.119 --> 21:24.654
You gotta really stir it,
otherwise it's gonna burn.

21:24.656 --> 21:26.589
Beans don't burn.

21:26.591 --> 21:28.257
Mm-hmm.

21:29.159 --> 21:30.359
- What's for dinner?
- Hi.

21:30.361 --> 21:32.061
- Hi.
- Are your hands clean?

21:32.063 --> 21:34.597
- Nope.
- I don't care.

21:34.599 --> 21:36.098
Can I have some, get it on me.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.533
- Catch it.
- I gotta run into town

21:37.535 --> 21:39.468
and gas up the truck.

21:39.470 --> 21:41.671
Supposed to be a major
snow storm headed our way

21:41.673 --> 21:44.073
and the tank's only half full.

21:44.075 --> 21:46.375
Okay honey, drive safe.

21:46.377 --> 21:49.178
Hey dad, Ryan will go with you.

21:56.186 --> 21:57.253
All right.

21:59.723 --> 22:01.390
Have fun.

22:18.342 --> 22:20.576
I'll be right back, you need anything?

22:20.578 --> 22:21.477
Beer?

22:22.713 --> 22:23.612
Beer?

22:26.817 --> 22:27.717
Okay.

23:02.853 --> 23:04.920
Sorry, I didn't see you.

23:06.857 --> 23:09.024
Gonna have a crazy Christmas, huh?

23:09.026 --> 23:10.593
These six beers.

23:12.362 --> 23:13.996
They're for my daughter's fiance.

23:13.998 --> 23:15.398
Fiance, Sarah?

23:17.134 --> 23:19.301
I didn't see that one coming.

23:19.303 --> 23:22.204
Yeah, he's from California.

23:22.206 --> 23:26.075
Well that is a shame, isn't it?

23:26.077 --> 23:27.243
Not really.

23:36.853 --> 23:39.622
Have a good night, David.

23:39.624 --> 23:41.190
Your fly's undone.

23:45.262 --> 23:47.596
You the same, Mr. Thomas.

24:03.613 --> 24:06.515
Serve and protect, my ass.

24:14.724 --> 24:16.559
Hi, can I help you?

24:17.961 --> 24:19.895
So you're Sarah's fiance, huh?

24:19.897 --> 24:20.797
Yeah.

24:22.532 --> 24:24.934
Tell me, is she still a firecracker?

24:24.936 --> 24:28.137
Excuse me?

24:28.139 --> 24:29.438
You heard me.

24:30.474 --> 24:32.308
Is there a problem?

24:34.311 --> 24:36.846
Is there something wrong, deputy?

24:36.848 --> 24:39.114
Just getting better acquainted with,

24:39.116 --> 24:40.950
what's your name?

24:40.952 --> 24:42.184
- Ryan.
- Ryan.

24:43.420 --> 24:45.421
Guys have a good night.

24:55.532 --> 24:58.267
Damn!

25:31.502 --> 25:32.968
You kidding me?

25:50.587 --> 25:51.887
I have no idea what's going on,

25:51.889 --> 25:55.891
but I'm getting a little
bit sick of this shit.

26:09.272 --> 26:10.272
Oh come on.

26:31.027 --> 26:34.263
Unbelievable.

26:44.741 --> 26:47.476
He made a comment about Sarah.

26:48.511 --> 26:50.012
Like what?

26:50.014 --> 26:52.514
Said she was a firecracker.

26:54.651 --> 26:56.218
Oh you know what it's like

26:56.220 --> 26:58.621
when you come back to your hometown.

26:58.623 --> 27:02.391
People remember who you
were and not who you are.

27:02.393 --> 27:03.626
Sarah was a...

27:05.895 --> 27:07.730
Was a bit of a rebel.

27:09.899 --> 27:13.636
That's one of the things I love about her.

27:22.879 --> 27:23.779
Come on.

27:30.020 --> 27:31.720
Greg, is there anything else on?

27:31.722 --> 27:35.591
The kids don't wanna watch
football all night.

27:35.593 --> 27:37.793
- I'm sure Ryan does.
- Oh, I don't mind.

27:39.597 --> 27:41.163
What's your team?

27:41.165 --> 27:42.065
Green bay.

27:43.566 --> 27:45.534
That's good to know, now
I won't get yelled at

27:45.536 --> 27:47.369
every time there's a game on.

27:47.371 --> 27:49.204
Okay, just not now.

27:52.409 --> 27:56.111
I can never figure out how
these stupid things work.

27:56.113 --> 27:58.847
It's the one that says channel, honey.

28:00.451 --> 28:02.718
What would I do without you?

28:02.720 --> 28:04.687
Went missing in the early
hours of the morning

28:04.689 --> 28:07.456
- lat Wednesday.
- Hey, turn it up.

28:09.125 --> 28:11.427
The bar owner and some of their patrons

28:11.429 --> 28:13.529
said they saw her seated at the bar alone

28:13.531 --> 28:16.065
for the majority of the evening.

28:16.067 --> 28:17.833
Police have since canvassed the area

28:17.835 --> 28:20.402
and have come up with nothing.

28:22.572 --> 28:24.773
Authorities are requesting that anybody

28:24.775 --> 28:27.476
with any information
regarding Julia Mahoney

28:27.478 --> 28:31.380
please contact the Lincoln
county sheriff's department.

28:34.585 --> 28:35.484
Wow.

28:37.053 --> 28:38.887
- You think she's dead?
- Hey, Ryan.

28:38.889 --> 28:40.055
What?

28:40.057 --> 28:42.157
Stuff like that doesn't happen up here.

28:42.159 --> 28:44.293
But isn't it the perfect
place to do something?

28:44.295 --> 28:45.661
I mean, we're in the middle of nowhere.

28:45.663 --> 28:47.563
Ryan.

28:47.565 --> 28:48.797
Just sayin'.

28:49.933 --> 28:52.568
Well, people out here
look out for each other.

28:52.570 --> 28:55.137
- Or so you think.
- Not funny!

28:57.874 --> 29:01.577
We're gonna be just fine, Sarah.

29:30.473 --> 29:32.808
Hey Carl,.

29:32.810 --> 29:35.778
Hey, I brought you some firewood.

29:36.679 --> 29:39.214
I figured you could use it.

29:39.216 --> 29:40.682
Well, that's very nice of you, Carl,

29:40.684 --> 29:42.484
but we've got plenty.

29:45.155 --> 29:46.388
Anything else?

29:47.690 --> 29:49.391
Snow's supposed to get pretty
bad the next couple days,

29:49.393 --> 29:51.960
I wouldn't want you to freeze.

29:54.631 --> 29:57.633
As I said, Carl, we're good here.

29:58.701 --> 30:00.869
But thanks for dropping by.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.654
- That guy is a nut job.
- Sarah!

30:18.656 --> 30:21.056
Mom, come on.

30:21.058 --> 30:23.625
Probably just lonely.

30:26.029 --> 30:28.397
I may have asked him to stop by.

30:28.399 --> 30:29.598
Seriously?

30:29.600 --> 30:32.000
Sarah, I didn't know what else to say.

30:32.002 --> 30:34.169
I didn't think he'd actually come.

30:34.171 --> 30:36.038
All right, it's fine, he's gone.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.406
Wash up, it's dinner time.

30:37.408 --> 30:38.874
Ryan, could you do me a favor?

30:38.876 --> 30:40.542
Could you get some more
firewood from outside?

30:40.544 --> 30:42.077
I'm gonna help Natalie in the kitchen.

30:42.079 --> 30:43.212
Yeah, sure.

35:11.747 --> 35:13.648
Yeah, just a second.

35:15.518 --> 35:19.321
Did ask if anyone needed
to use the bathroom.

35:43.546 --> 35:45.947
You doing that on purpose?

35:45.949 --> 35:47.282
What?

35:48.417 --> 35:50.085
Driving me crazy.

36:05.035 --> 36:07.836
<i>Que Pasa</i>, what's this?

36:07.838 --> 36:09.471
- Open it.
- Really?

36:11.674 --> 36:12.574
Okay.

36:14.277 --> 36:16.144
I gotta warn ya, if it's
an engagement ring,

36:16.146 --> 36:20.682
I'm not really ready for
this kinda commitment.

36:29.258 --> 36:30.158
Sarah,

36:31.060 --> 36:32.894
Sarah, it's too much.

36:34.163 --> 36:35.730
Merry Christmas.

36:40.970 --> 36:42.270
It's perfect.

36:43.673 --> 36:46.241
- Come here, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

36:51.180 --> 36:52.147
You know?

36:53.149 --> 36:55.050
I'm kind of in love with you.

36:56.553 --> 36:57.552
Just a little bit.

36:57.554 --> 36:59.521
My parents are still awake.

36:59.523 --> 37:02.190
Well, you are gonna have to be

37:02.192 --> 37:04.826
extra quiet, Mrs. Emerson.

37:37.393 --> 37:38.293
Wow.

37:39.662 --> 37:41.196
Great fort.

37:41.198 --> 37:42.697
It's a duck blind.

37:42.699 --> 37:44.532
- Yeah, I knew that.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:44.534 --> 37:46.268
- Right here?
- Yeah.

37:50.973 --> 37:54.075
- All right, m'lady.
- Thank you, Sir.

37:54.077 --> 37:55.310
Down you go.

37:58.914 --> 38:01.349
Oop.

38:01.351 --> 38:03.118
- Graceful.
- You okay?

38:03.120 --> 38:04.352
Yeah, here, take your gloves.

38:04.354 --> 38:05.420
Thank you.

38:07.823 --> 38:09.824
- Here you go.
- Merci.

38:13.929 --> 38:15.330
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:22.705 --> 38:26.174
Wisconsin wine.

38:27.543 --> 38:32.347
You know, I don't think your
dad likes me very much.

38:32.349 --> 38:34.316
He likes you.

38:34.318 --> 38:37.085
He's just being protective.

38:37.087 --> 38:40.522
- He'll warm up.
- Well, he better.

38:40.524 --> 38:43.058
'Cause I'm not going anywhere.

38:43.060 --> 38:44.559
You better not.

38:55.705 --> 38:57.005
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

38:57.007 --> 39:00.175
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- Such good potatoes.

39:00.177 --> 39:01.643
- You like 'em?
- Yes.

39:01.645 --> 39:03.378
I tried something new with them this time.

39:03.380 --> 39:04.979
- What?
- You want these, dad?

39:04.981 --> 39:06.548
Well, I used a different seasoning.

39:06.550 --> 39:07.982
They're crispy, I like 'em like that.

39:07.984 --> 39:09.517
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

39:09.519 --> 39:11.419
I've found that potatoes are one of the

39:11.421 --> 39:12.754
easiest things for me to make

39:12.756 --> 39:14.956
so I've been eating way too much starch.

39:14.958 --> 39:16.558
One of the few things you don't burn.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.759
True.

39:17.761 --> 39:19.627
I've yet to meet potato I do not like.

39:19.629 --> 39:21.262
Mom, we always eat so early.

39:21.264 --> 39:22.997
It's tradition.

39:22.999 --> 39:24.632
Don't mess with tradition.

39:24.634 --> 39:26.801
And now Ryan gets to be a part of it.

39:26.803 --> 39:29.170
- Well, I love it.
- Aw, you kiss ass.

39:32.676 --> 39:34.008
No, I'm good.

39:35.344 --> 39:36.878
Could you pass me the
butter please, sweetheart?

39:36.880 --> 39:38.680
No, I got it.

39:38.682 --> 39:39.681
Here ya go.

39:44.186 --> 39:46.588
These carrots are fantastic.

39:48.657 --> 39:50.625
Okay, since I'm always the
one to pass out gifts,

39:50.627 --> 39:53.862
I decided dad's gonna do it this year.

39:55.631 --> 39:59.200
What happened to tradition?
- Will you be quiet?

39:59.202 --> 40:00.268
All right.

40:05.241 --> 40:06.141
To Ryan.

40:08.577 --> 40:10.445
From Mr. and Mrs. Thomas.

40:24.693 --> 40:26.795
That was Sarah's grandfather's.

40:26.797 --> 40:28.096
We thought it would be
special for you to have

40:28.098 --> 40:31.032
now that you're part of this family.

40:31.034 --> 40:32.901
Thank you so much.

40:32.903 --> 40:35.403
Thank you, Mr. Thomas.

40:35.405 --> 40:36.905
You're welcome.

40:41.877 --> 40:43.044
To Mr. Thomas

40:44.146 --> 40:45.046
from Ryan.

40:57.660 --> 40:58.560
Cubans.

41:02.232 --> 41:03.131
Wow!

41:05.134 --> 41:07.569
Where'd you get these?

41:07.571 --> 41:10.104
I have a friend south of the border,

41:10.106 --> 41:14.008
Sarah told me how much
you really like cigars.

41:17.413 --> 41:18.313
Cool.

41:19.949 --> 41:20.849
Thank you.

41:21.951 --> 41:23.485
All right, mom, this one's special.

41:23.487 --> 41:25.720
I want you to open it now.

41:44.874 --> 41:45.940
Hey, you ready?

41:45.942 --> 41:46.941
Let's go.

42:09.698 --> 42:11.299
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

42:11.301 --> 42:13.902
give it up for the very talented,

42:13.904 --> 42:16.671
very yummy, Tyler Patterson.

42:22.811 --> 42:25.713
Thank you for that introduction.

42:57.180 --> 42:58.913
He's good, right?

42:58.915 --> 43:00.481
Yeah, he's okay.

43:02.718 --> 43:04.052
- Uh-oh.
- What?

43:04.987 --> 43:07.288
- You jealous?
- No, what?

43:07.290 --> 43:08.389
No.

43:10.493 --> 43:14.562
No, I'm definitely not
jealous of your handsome,

43:14.564 --> 43:16.497
John-Mayer-sounding ex-boyfriend.

43:17.734 --> 43:18.666
Even if he does have a smile that

43:18.668 --> 43:21.736
could melt the polar ice caps.

43:21.738 --> 43:24.072
Well, he doesn't melt me.

43:25.741 --> 43:27.108
No?

43:27.110 --> 43:28.009
No.

43:29.111 --> 43:31.045
There's only one man that can do that to me

43:31.047 --> 43:33.448
and that is my fiance.

43:33.450 --> 43:35.049
Really?

43:35.051 --> 43:37.051
- You're engaged?
- Yeah.

43:37.053 --> 43:37.986
What?

43:37.988 --> 43:39.587
Must be one heck of a guy.

43:39.589 --> 43:40.822
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

43:47.563 --> 43:49.030
You're kinda stuck with me.

43:49.032 --> 43:53.167
That's a good thing 'cause
you're kinda stuck with me too.

44:10.986 --> 44:13.221
Oh my god, Tyler, hi!

44:13.223 --> 44:16.891
You did so great.
- Thank you guys for coming.

44:16.893 --> 44:19.293
- Of course.
- Good job, man.

44:20.963 --> 44:23.297
For a little bar out in
the middle of nowhere.

44:23.299 --> 44:24.732
I'm sure you guys see
plenty of talented people

44:24.734 --> 44:26.968
- out there in California.
- There's a few.

44:26.970 --> 44:28.936
Well I'd love to get out there some day.

44:28.938 --> 44:30.838
Oh you should come visit us.

44:30.840 --> 44:33.708
Thank you, but it's kind
of hard to get away

44:33.710 --> 44:36.110
from my mom right now with
my dad leaving and all.

44:36.112 --> 44:37.779
Okay, well you both will
definitely have to come out

44:37.781 --> 44:40.181
- for the wedding.
- We wouldn't miss it.

44:40.183 --> 44:41.549
Hey, let me get you guys another drink.

44:41.551 --> 44:44.552
- Sure.
- How 'bout you, Ry?

44:44.554 --> 44:46.888
- Why not?
- Yeah, that a boy!

44:46.890 --> 44:49.724
- Three more shots please.
- You got it.

45:20.657 --> 45:22.056
What was that?

45:23.759 --> 45:25.059
I don't know.

45:36.338 --> 45:37.705
- What's going on?
- It's okay, honey,

45:37.707 --> 45:39.040
we just heard something.
- I don't know, someone

45:39.042 --> 45:40.575
was knocking on the front door.

45:42.445 --> 45:43.678
I don't see anything.

45:45.448 --> 45:47.115
- Oh my god.
- Greg.

45:48.117 --> 45:49.317
- Stay there.
- Why would anybody be

45:49.319 --> 45:51.285
- coming here right now?
- I don't know.

45:51.287 --> 45:53.688
Greg, what's going on?

45:53.690 --> 45:56.090
- You see anything?
- Nobody.

45:59.428 --> 46:00.862
What are you doing?

46:00.864 --> 46:02.063
We don't need a gun,
somebody's gonna get hurt.

46:02.065 --> 46:04.265
Dad, what are you doing?

46:04.267 --> 46:07.735
Something is going on right now, Natalie!

46:07.737 --> 46:09.871
I'm calling the police.

46:13.208 --> 46:14.108
It's dead.

46:21.517 --> 46:23.584
It's okay, stay there.

46:27.289 --> 46:28.523
Dad.

46:30.659 --> 46:32.393
- Greg.
- It's okay.

47:05.228 --> 47:06.294
Oh my god!

47:12.768 --> 47:14.268
- No!
- Oh my god!

47:16.238 --> 47:17.405
Run!

47:36.825 --> 47:39.060
What's going on?

47:41.396 --> 47:43.798
What's happening, oh my god.

47:46.235 --> 47:48.769
Hey, where are the flashlights?

47:58.046 --> 47:58.946
Stay here.

48:00.249 --> 48:03.184
My god.

48:07.489 --> 48:09.523
Put these on, we have to make a run for it.

48:09.525 --> 48:10.758
We can't go out there.

48:10.760 --> 48:14.128
Well we can't stay in here either, come on.

48:20.102 --> 48:21.002
Shh.

48:33.016 --> 48:34.448
Run, run!

48:40.789 --> 48:41.689
Sarah!

49:15.324 --> 49:18.292
Come on, come on, come on.

49:18.294 --> 49:20.361
No, no, no, no, damn it!

50:00.469 --> 50:04.739
Sarah!

50:04.741 --> 50:06.374
I got out there and I
just I ran, I'm sorry!

50:06.376 --> 50:08.909
It's okay, it's okay.

50:08.911 --> 50:10.177
Did you see anyone else out there?

50:10.179 --> 50:12.446
I don't know, all I know, one got inside.

50:12.448 --> 50:14.348
Listen, Sarah, listen to me.

50:14.350 --> 50:15.850
We've gotta find your mom,

50:15.852 --> 50:17.051
we've gotta get the key to the truck

50:17.053 --> 50:18.552
and we've gotta get out of here.

50:18.554 --> 50:19.987
I don't want to go out
there, he's out there.

50:19.989 --> 50:21.522
- I don't want to...
- Sarah!

50:21.524 --> 50:23.057
Listen to me, okay?

50:23.059 --> 50:25.559
I'm just as scared as you are.

50:25.561 --> 50:27.028
Okay?

50:27.030 --> 50:28.963
But I need you to keep it
together because if you don't,

50:28.965 --> 50:31.665
we are not gonna make it out of this alive.

50:31.667 --> 50:33.667
Can you do that for me?

50:36.138 --> 50:37.671
- Take this.
- Why?

50:37.673 --> 50:39.040
In case we get separated, you
gonna need more than one.

50:39.042 --> 50:40.274
We can get separated, Ryan.

50:40.276 --> 50:42.743
Yes, Sarah, yes you can, yes you can.

50:42.745 --> 50:45.112
We have to go now, okay?

50:45.114 --> 50:46.013
Let's go.

51:12.207 --> 51:13.574
Carl?

51:13.576 --> 51:15.509
Come on, let's go around back.

52:07.662 --> 52:09.897
- Check the bathroom.
- Okay.

52:29.918 --> 52:31.418
Mom!

52:31.420 --> 52:33.487
Ryan, she's in here!

52:33.489 --> 52:36.891
Oh my god, I had no idea where you were!

52:36.893 --> 52:38.893
We were in a duck blind,
we thought we lost you.

52:38.895 --> 52:42.129
Let's get the keys and get outta here.

52:54.943 --> 52:55.843
Sarah!

52:58.513 --> 52:59.413
Sarah!

53:22.370 --> 53:23.070
Oh my god.

53:26.274 --> 53:27.174
Sarah.

54:00.308 --> 54:03.978
No, no, no, no.

54:08.217 --> 54:10.184
Why are you doing this?

54:19.194 --> 54:20.094
Help me!

54:31.172 --> 54:32.072
Sarah?

54:37.812 --> 54:38.712
Sarah?

54:40.949 --> 54:42.116
Oh god.

54:48.590 --> 54:49.790
Sarah?

54:49.792 --> 54:51.859
Please wake up, wake up.

55:02.404 --> 55:03.304
Okay.

55:07.642 --> 55:10.277
Let's go, we're getting outta here.

55:10.279 --> 55:11.178
Let's go.

55:20.155 --> 55:22.323
All right, baby, come on.

55:24.225 --> 55:25.759
Sarah.

55:25.761 --> 55:27.661
Sarah, Sarah, wake up.

55:28.596 --> 55:29.930
- Oh thank god.
- Where is he?

55:29.932 --> 55:31.365
I don't know, I don't know.
- Where's my mom?

55:31.367 --> 55:34.101
- We gotta get to the car.
- Sarah.

55:36.604 --> 55:38.572
She tried to get away in the truck but

55:38.574 --> 55:41.909
she lost control, crashed in the ditch.

55:41.911 --> 55:43.077
I'm so sorry.

55:44.612 --> 55:47.281
I'm so sorry.

55:47.283 --> 55:50.517
Okay, listen, we gotta get out of here.

55:50.519 --> 55:52.086
I'm not dying here today
and neither are you,

55:52.088 --> 55:53.153
do you understand?

55:53.155 --> 55:54.922
- I love you.
- I love you.

55:54.924 --> 55:56.657
Go, go, go!

56:04.499 --> 56:05.399
Come on!

56:06.301 --> 56:08.702
Ryan, slow down, I can't run!

56:08.704 --> 56:10.037
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know,

56:10.039 --> 56:12.473
just keep going!
- I can't keep up with you!

56:12.475 --> 56:15.275
Sarah, listen to me,
they know where we are.

56:15.277 --> 56:18.979
We can't stop, we have
to find a place to hide.

56:18.981 --> 56:20.214
Okay?

56:20.216 --> 56:21.115
Come on.

56:24.053 --> 56:25.719
- Woah, woah woah, Sarah!
- Tyler!

56:25.721 --> 56:27.121
Tyler, Tyler, you gotta help us, please.

56:27.123 --> 56:28.422
Tyler, they're trying to kill us!

56:28.424 --> 56:31.158
Okay, calm down, who's trying to kill you?

56:31.160 --> 56:34.128
I don't know, we gotta keep moving, now.

56:34.130 --> 56:37.097
Okay, well, let's, follow me.

56:37.099 --> 56:38.365
Wait, what are you doing out here

56:38.367 --> 56:39.566
in the middle of the night, Tyler?

56:39.568 --> 56:41.835
Oh my god, Ryan, he's going to help us.

56:41.837 --> 56:43.303
Answer me!

56:43.305 --> 56:45.639
I heard gunshots coming
from your place, okay?

56:45.641 --> 56:47.808
And with everything that's
been going on lately,

56:47.810 --> 56:49.710
you know, people are kidnapped,
there are break-ins,

56:49.712 --> 56:51.078
I wanted to check on her.

56:51.080 --> 56:52.980
Now, let's go.

56:57.152 --> 56:58.685
Tyler!

56:58.687 --> 57:00.254
Sarah, run, run!

58:39.921 --> 58:41.555
You chicken shit.

58:45.293 --> 58:46.693
Don't even have the fuckin' balls

58:46.695 --> 58:49.162
to show your face to me, huh?

58:51.032 --> 58:53.166
What, got nothin' to say?

58:55.169 --> 58:56.503
Ya cock sucker.

58:59.741 --> 59:00.641
Come on!

59:06.481 --> 59:07.548
Who are you?

59:15.056 --> 59:15.956
Let me go.

59:31.139 --> 59:32.706
You fuckin' pussy!

59:57.398 --> 59:58.298
Please.

01:00:03.571 --> 01:00:05.138
I don't wanna die.

01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:11.745
Let me go, let me go now.

01:00:24.292 --> 01:00:25.926
Please,

01:00:25.928 --> 01:00:26.827
god.

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:29.830
Please.

01:00:56.724 --> 01:01:00.127
Please.

01:01:07.935 --> 01:01:08.835
Please!

01:03:04.819 --> 01:03:06.052
No!

01:03:06.054 --> 01:03:06.953
No, no.

01:03:17.965 --> 01:03:18.865
No!

01:03:21.035 --> 01:03:22.369
No.

01:03:22.371 --> 01:03:23.270
Ryan.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.140
Please.

01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:29.543
Please.

01:03:29.545 --> 01:03:30.744
Please,

01:03:30.746 --> 01:03:31.578
no!

01:03:46.761 --> 01:03:47.661
Ow.

01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:41.574
Hey,

01:05:41.576 --> 01:05:42.475
hey, wait!

01:06:46.774 --> 01:06:47.674
What?

01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:50.810
Surprise.

01:06:51.645 --> 01:06:52.545
What?

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:57.784
I saw you...
- dying?

01:06:59.453 --> 01:07:02.655
Well, I had to take the
attention off me somehow.

01:07:02.657 --> 01:07:06.559
So cliche to have the
jealous ex be the killer.

01:07:06.561 --> 01:07:09.529
We've all seen that before, boring.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.634
You're so gullible.

01:07:14.636 --> 01:07:16.102
It's really cute.

01:07:17.438 --> 01:07:19.506
How could you do this?

01:07:20.541 --> 01:07:22.142
How could you think that's it's okay

01:07:22.144 --> 01:07:24.978
to go off and marry someone else?

01:07:28.682 --> 01:07:31.751
But I do owe you an apology.

01:07:31.753 --> 01:07:34.421
Hey, I'm sorry for hitting you.

01:07:35.189 --> 01:07:36.689
Fuck you.

01:07:36.691 --> 01:07:38.024
Hey, there's no excuse for
that kind of behavior

01:07:38.026 --> 01:07:40.260
and it's not gonna happen again.

01:07:40.262 --> 01:07:41.161
I'm sorry.

01:07:42.596 --> 01:07:46.166
You're just so hard to pin down, you know?

01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:55.041
I always knew there was
something special between us.

01:07:55.043 --> 01:07:56.743
Then we had that magical summer together

01:07:56.745 --> 01:08:00.246
and I knew that I can't live without you.

01:08:00.248 --> 01:08:01.881
What?

01:08:01.883 --> 01:08:03.650
Then you just left.

01:08:06.087 --> 01:08:08.521
I don't understand how you could just,

01:08:08.523 --> 01:08:12.158
just walk away from everything that we had.

01:08:17.865 --> 01:08:18.765
Stop.

01:08:23.104 --> 01:08:25.104
It was supposed to be me.

01:08:25.107 --> 01:08:26.005
No!

01:08:28.042 --> 01:08:30.443
And now it can be.

01:08:41.856 --> 01:08:43.857
I am so proud of you.

01:08:47.495 --> 01:08:49.929
I just knew you two would end up together.

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:51.430
She did, she did, she always used to say,

01:08:51.433 --> 01:08:53.233
"you're gonna marry that girl, Tyler."

01:08:53.234 --> 01:08:55.568
And here we are, it's fate.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.406
- Now.
- Okay.

01:09:23.363 --> 01:09:24.430
I'm sorry.

01:09:26.066 --> 01:09:26.966
I'm sorry.

01:09:30.304 --> 01:09:31.804
Do you like it?

01:09:32.573 --> 01:09:35.140
You people are sick.

01:09:36.344 --> 01:09:37.510
Mom!

01:09:37.511 --> 01:09:40.513
Don't you talk about my son that way.

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:44.716
Mom, what the hell?

01:09:46.554 --> 01:09:47.453
Oh.

01:09:48.988 --> 01:09:49.889
Oh, I,

01:09:51.158 --> 01:09:52.392
I am so sorry.

01:09:54.695 --> 01:09:57.764
I'm just, I'm just a protective mom.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.768
It's okay, it's okay.

01:10:05.139 --> 01:10:06.039
It's okay.

01:10:10.077 --> 01:10:13.580
Mom, can I have a moment with my fiancee?

01:10:15.583 --> 01:10:17.016
Of course.

01:10:17.018 --> 01:10:17.917
Alone.

01:10:19.053 --> 01:10:21.421
Can I have a moment alone, is that okay?

01:10:21.423 --> 01:10:22.322
Alone?

01:10:25.092 --> 01:10:26.059
Well, it's,

01:10:27.895 --> 01:10:29.295
it's your night.

01:10:32.366 --> 01:10:33.233
I will,

01:10:34.935 --> 01:10:36.970
I'll be outside if you need me.

01:10:36.972 --> 01:10:39.372
- Okay?
- Thank you, thank you.

01:11:39.767 --> 01:11:44.003
Hank, I told you those pieces
were gonna weigh you down.

01:11:56.183 --> 01:11:58.751
I tried to move on.

01:11:58.753 --> 01:12:00.153
See other women.

01:12:01.322 --> 01:12:04.190
You met Julia, she was pretty, right?

01:12:08.829 --> 01:12:13.066
I was hoping that she could
fill the hole in my heart.

01:12:17.771 --> 01:12:19.205
But she didn't understand what it meant

01:12:19.207 --> 01:12:22.175
to be with someone so I let her go.

01:12:25.779 --> 01:12:27.113
You did that?

01:12:32.453 --> 01:12:33.953
She wasn't you.

01:12:37.791 --> 01:12:40.026
No one, no one can be you.

01:12:40.028 --> 01:12:42.261
No one can compare to you.

01:12:43.964 --> 01:12:47.066
No one can compare with you.

01:12:47.068 --> 01:12:49.702
Everything's gonna be okay now.

01:12:49.704 --> 01:12:51.037
Stop.

01:12:51.039 --> 01:12:52.839
It's okay now, hey.

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.540
It's okay.

01:12:56.143 --> 01:12:57.310
It's okay, it's just us now...

01:13:14.561 --> 01:13:18.898
Hey, hey, hey, I'm gonna
be right back, okay?

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.967
I'm gonna be right back.

01:13:33.914 --> 01:13:37.083
Mom!

01:13:38.685 --> 01:13:40.186
No,

01:13:40.188 --> 01:13:41.087
no.

01:13:41.089 --> 01:13:42.221
No, mom, mom.

01:13:43.223 --> 01:13:45.291
Mom, mom, mom, no no no.

01:13:58.872 --> 01:14:00.373
Hey, I'm gonna untie you.

01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:01.607
I'm gonna untie you but
you have to promise me

01:14:01.609 --> 01:14:04.110
that you're not gonna run.

01:14:08.315 --> 01:14:11.484
I can't lose two people I love, okay?

01:14:17.157 --> 01:14:18.057
Let's go!

01:14:20.494 --> 01:14:21.394
Ow!

01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:27.533
It's just me and you now.

01:14:27.535 --> 01:14:29.001
Ow, no!

01:14:31.138 --> 01:14:32.038
No!

01:14:33.173 --> 01:14:34.207
No!

01:14:34.209 --> 01:14:36.375
Get in the car!

01:14:43.717 --> 01:14:44.617
No, no!

01:14:46.887 --> 01:14:49.489
Don't touch the fuckin' door.

01:14:49.491 --> 01:14:50.957
Stay right there.

01:14:55.128 --> 01:14:56.028
Oh fuck.

01:14:57.064 --> 01:14:58.631
Ow!

01:14:58.633 --> 01:14:59.799
Where are the keys?

01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:01.334
No, no, no, look for the keys!

01:15:01.336 --> 01:15:03.302
I don't have your fucking keys!

01:15:03.304 --> 01:15:05.371
Fuck, god,

01:15:05.373 --> 01:15:06.272
fuck!

01:15:08.409 --> 01:15:10.309
Stay here, don't move.

01:15:20.187 --> 01:15:21.420
Mom!
