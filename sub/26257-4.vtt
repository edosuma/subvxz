00:06.381 --> 00:09.884
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:11.970 --> 00:15.306
This is Technical Sergeant
Liliko Kinutsugai from Misawa Air Base.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.933
Her TAC name is Jimmy.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.562
Next is Technical Sergeant Mayumi Hitomi
from Iruma Air Base.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.063
Goes by the TAC name Morris.

00:22.939 --> 00:26.317
Lastly, from Tsuiki Air Base is
Senior Master Sergeant El Hoshino.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.153
Her TAC name is Penguin.

00:28.445 --> 00:32.699
These three OTF pilots
will be joining us for training.

00:32.782 --> 00:33.992
Joint training?

00:34.409 --> 00:37.746
The training will also focus
on OTF stress relief.

00:38.079 --> 00:41.166
-We'll hold a realistic mock battle...
-Seriously? Three more?

00:41.291 --> 00:43.209
And Dragon Pilots are all women, too.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.419
Jackpot!

00:44.502 --> 00:47.672
-Harem status!
-What are you so happy about?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.925
Do you know how much we've suffered
from that woman?

00:51.384 --> 00:55.055
I'm informed that all three women
have exceptional piloting skills,

00:55.388 --> 00:58.141
incomparable to our own
Technical Sergeant Hisone Amakasu.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.936
When you phrase it like that,
it's not exactly uplifting...

01:02.145 --> 01:03.938
Dragon Pilots are all the same!

01:04.022 --> 01:05.732
Skilled or not!

01:05.815 --> 01:07.192
Now, now.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.277
If Dragon Pilots come from other bases,

01:09.360 --> 01:12.864
then Technical Sergeant Amakasu
would represent Gifu.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.240
Represent?

01:14.324 --> 01:15.867
Exactly!

01:16.409 --> 01:20.163
Flight Leader Kogure
just mentioned something great!

01:20.288 --> 01:24.334
As the Gifu Air Base representative,
in other words, as the face of Gifu,

01:24.417 --> 01:27.212
-She's talking about the show!
-...to prove Gifu's potential,

01:27.504 --> 01:29.005
I will give it my all!

03:17.030 --> 03:20.033
What's with those names, Jimmy and Morris?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.577
And Penguin sounds so weak.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.955
But even Amakasu has a TAC name...

03:27.207 --> 03:28.917
What the hell!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.002
In my case, I would be...

03:31.544 --> 03:34.005
Sexy...

03:34.088 --> 03:35.256
Jaguar!

03:38.801 --> 03:39.636
Maybe not.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.221
-There it is.
-Huh?

03:41.804 --> 03:43.806
Yeah, yeah. That's right, that's right.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.391
True, true.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.810
-Amakasu.
-Ah! Nao!

03:47.894 --> 03:48.937
What are you doing?

03:49.020 --> 03:52.232
The bathroom is supposed to be
the one inviolable place of privacy!

03:52.315 --> 03:54.776
It's only because you were
muttering nonstop.

03:54.859 --> 03:55.860
What're you reading?

03:56.694 --> 03:57.695
This.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.822
How to be empathetic?

04:00.365 --> 04:03.493
Personal relations are
what I avoid the most!

04:03.910 --> 04:06.037
To fulfill my role as the face of Gifu

04:06.120 --> 04:10.291
and work well with the other pilots,
I should learn from my predecessors!

04:10.750 --> 04:13.753
-By reading this sketchy article?
-Exactly.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.464
For you, who lives
by your beastly intuition,

04:16.547 --> 04:19.717
you might not even need
a TAC name like "Sexy Jaguar."

04:20.301 --> 04:21.261
Ow!

04:21.970 --> 04:24.180
I realized at the air show the other day

04:24.681 --> 04:28.059
that I must possess
the talent to be a Dragon Pilot!

04:28.142 --> 04:28.977
Huh?

04:29.102 --> 04:33.648
Which is even more of a reason
not to let personal relations stop me!

04:34.190 --> 04:35.858
Every word she says pisses me off.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.403
Yup. True, true.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.280
Just like you said, Sexy Jaguar!

04:40.613 --> 04:41.739
Ow! Ouch!

04:41.906 --> 04:44.200
That really hurts, Nao!

04:45.159 --> 04:47.954
You two! Hurry and meet at the apron!

04:48.121 --> 04:48.955
Huh?

04:49.289 --> 04:52.917
It seems all three OTF are arriving
at the same time.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.004
<i>Runway 28, continue approach.</i>

04:56.170 --> 04:58.339
<i>Runway 28, cleared to land.</i>

04:58.423 --> 05:00.508
<i>Wind 140 at 8.</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:01.634
Norell 01.

05:02.051 --> 05:02.885
Roger.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.387
Cleared to land.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.144
This'll be quite the spectacle.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.187
Yeah.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.689
They're about ready to come out.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.116
Sniff, sniff.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.744
Munch. Gulp.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.207
Even the Gifu air tastes good, Futomomo.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.432
Uh, please don't look this way.
Staring triggers my ophthalmophobia.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.393
These are the Dragon Pilots?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.977
They're pretty faint of heart.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.271
And they're not all slimy.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.231
Slimy?

06:38.773 --> 06:41.359
Why doesn't F-2 change into Hotel mode?

06:53.621 --> 06:54.622
Nice to meet you.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.208
I am El Hoshino from Tsuiki Air Base.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.711
I look forward to receiving
your encouragement and guidance.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.505
And this one here...

07:02.588 --> 07:04.090
Is an overachiever.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.384
She's not slimy, either!

07:06.467 --> 07:08.177
A properly trained pilot

07:08.261 --> 07:11.764
does not needlessly
stimluate the OTC's insides.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.350
All right, time to take a run.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.268
Right now?

07:15.560 --> 07:18.271
You're not exempt
just because you arrived now.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.148
This is how we do things at Gifu!

07:20.273 --> 07:21.607
Isn't that right, Amakasu?

07:21.691 --> 07:22.525
Yes, sir!

07:22.608 --> 07:24.402
Time to empathize!

07:26.988 --> 07:29.198
Hey! Pick up the pace!

07:29.282 --> 07:31.492
If you want to be
on the same playing field,

07:31.576 --> 07:33.703
you gotta be twice as tough as the boys!

07:37.415 --> 07:40.960
I can't do it. My body feels so heavy.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.462
Of course, of course!

07:43.296 --> 07:46.841
I really am just a useless human,
dragging my feet.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.051
I see, I see!

07:50.386 --> 07:51.220
Oh?

07:51.554 --> 07:55.016
You're completely missing
the point of empathy.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.769
This is where you will stay.

07:59.395 --> 08:02.440
Ah, a room for six.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.442
What're ya doing?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.486
Ensuring my personal space.

08:06.777 --> 08:07.612
Hey,

08:08.571 --> 08:11.866
-wanna do flight training now?
-What? Right now?

08:12.575 --> 08:14.785
I've received permission
from the commander.

08:15.203 --> 08:19.081
We should do everything we can to learn
about each others' OTF's capabilities.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.958
I'll pass.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.252
I wish not to exert too much energy.

08:23.961 --> 08:28.925
My Futomomo had to fly so far from Iruma.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.886
-I want to give him time to rest--
-Are you being serious?

08:32.386 --> 08:33.221
Oh?

08:33.429 --> 08:36.390
We've taken the maintenance team
away from their normal duties.

08:36.516 --> 08:41.646
Seeing that should make you realize
exactly how vital this joint training is.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.191
We have to bring results to satisfy
their high expectations too.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.068
-We are--
-You're right!

08:47.151 --> 08:48.236
As the face of Gifu--

08:48.945 --> 08:50.112
What's with you suddenly?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.656
Hoshino's remarks...

08:52.240 --> 08:53.866
are true words of empathy!

08:54.492 --> 08:57.286
Pure empathy
without a shred of dishonesty.

08:57.578 --> 08:58.454
So what?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.373
Are you gonna do it or not?

09:00.665 --> 09:02.667
Of course I'm doing it!

09:03.376 --> 09:05.836
Well then. You show promise.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.255
Empathy.

09:12.051 --> 09:16.305
-Looks like they're going on a flight.
-Yeah. They just decided the plan.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.183
But Tsuiki's OTF sure is amazing.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.603
Even when it's off duty,
it maintains Foxtrot mode.

09:22.770 --> 09:27.233
Well, it's been like that ever since
Hoshino became a Dragon Pilot.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.526
What's wrong?

09:28.651 --> 09:30.027
You can relax a little.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.699
Your OTF is just rearing to go,
isn't it, Hoshino?

09:34.782 --> 09:35.616
Amakasu.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.077
Is there something wrong with my F-2?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.746
No, but I wanted to make adjustments
before the flight--

09:40.830 --> 09:41.664
It's unnecessary.

09:41.747 --> 09:46.711
But staying in the fitted equipment
for an extended time can stress the--

09:46.794 --> 09:48.379
My F-2 is a fighter jet.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.632
I don't need you to treat it like a pet.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.176
-Question!
-Yes, Amakasu.

09:54.427 --> 09:59.515
Then will you let the face of Gifu...
no, Masotan and I show you how we fly?

10:00.266 --> 10:01.100
Huh?

10:03.936 --> 10:05.146
<i>Mambo Viking 01.</i>

10:05.605 --> 10:08.316
<i>Wind 080 at 6.</i>

10:08.399 --> 10:09.650
<i>Cleared for takeoff.</i>

10:10.026 --> 10:15.156
Masotan, we're already in league with
tremendous, high-performance elites!

10:15.656 --> 10:17.658
Let's show Hoshino what we're made of!

10:30.338 --> 10:32.298
Yes, I understand.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.549
Bye.

10:36.218 --> 10:39.555
It's rare for him
to personally make a visit here.

10:39.889 --> 10:44.226
Well, this joint training was his idea
in the first place.

10:44.435 --> 10:48.064
In any case,
each woman is very individualistic.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.065
On the surface.

10:49.899 --> 10:55.321
But oddly enough,
the OTF sniffed them out...

11:00.660 --> 11:05.956
by the one thing connecting
all of the chosen women.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.377
-What was that?
-They're all over the place.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.879
Because of people like that...

11:12.046 --> 11:16.592
Hiso Maso!

11:17.968 --> 11:20.179
PLEASE KEEP THE RESTROOM CLEAN

11:23.516 --> 11:24.975
Thanks.

11:25.059 --> 11:29.271
Being shaken in every way possible
would make anyone like this...

11:29.480 --> 11:31.982
Once you recover, wanna go for a drink?

11:32.066 --> 11:35.194
Why would you invite someone
who was puking her guts out for a drink?

11:35.277 --> 11:37.321
Only a real airhead would do that--

11:37.863 --> 11:38.781
Hoshino!

11:39.281 --> 11:42.076
-What'll you do?
-Of course I'll go!

11:42.201 --> 11:45.287
Is that so? I'll go ask the others too.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.210
Amakasu, are you still alive?

11:51.293 --> 11:52.670
Drinkommunication!

11:53.504 --> 11:56.924
With the power of alcohol,
we can close the gap!

12:01.345 --> 12:02.930
So his name is Masotan!

12:03.597 --> 12:06.684
The "Sota" in his name is adorable.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.646
You call your OTF "Futomomo," right?

12:10.855 --> 12:12.273
Yes, I do.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.609
Because his thighs
are his most charming assets.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.029
It makes him so happy
when I pet him there.

12:19.113 --> 12:19.989
I... see...

12:20.072 --> 12:23.826
My TAC name was taken from Futomomo too.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.912
I'm Morris because Futomomo gives me
more and more.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.289
What about your OTF?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.541
My OTF's name is Akemi.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.544
My TAC name is Jimmy
since it's plain and boring like me.

12:33.961 --> 12:37.590
That's not true at all.
Or maybe just a little?

12:37.673 --> 12:40.801
You don't need to sugarcoat it.
In the first place...

12:40.885 --> 12:45.055
<i>Oh my gosh! We're actually</i>
<i>engaging in girl talk!</i>

12:45.347 --> 12:46.307
<i>At this rate,</i>

12:46.390 --> 12:50.603
<i>I might actually make friends</i>
<i>for the first time in my life!</i>

12:51.729 --> 12:52.730
Hoshino.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.316
What's your OTF's name?

12:55.524 --> 12:56.358
F-2.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.069
Oh, I didn't mean the plane equipment--

12:59.487 --> 13:00.613
All of you...

13:00.863 --> 13:02.865
think too little
of your positions as pilots.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.578
This is not a zoo
and we are not zookeepers.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.666
We are pilots and OTF belong to the base.
There's no need for names.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.376
Don't you get that?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.463
B-But Hoshino,

13:17.671 --> 13:19.673
you've got a cute TAC name.

13:21.175 --> 13:25.346
The first fearless penguin in the group
to jump into the ocean.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.473
That's where it came from.

13:28.432 --> 13:32.144
I will become...
the first female fighter pilot.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.104
First penguin.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.442
I don't sense that fighting spirit
in any of you.

13:38.901 --> 13:44.114
Well... since we fly dragons
and not fighter jets...

13:44.615 --> 13:46.617
How should I put it so you understand?

13:47.535 --> 13:50.371
Because you view your OTF as dragons,

13:50.454 --> 13:52.373
you're all no good.

13:52.623 --> 13:53.707
M-Me?

13:53.958 --> 13:55.042
The rest of you too.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.294
Your OTF are slacking off.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.464
Dragon Pilots on the whole
are looked down upon because of you--

14:00.548 --> 14:01.382
Pardon me,

14:01.757 --> 14:04.635
I'm aware that I am no good,

14:04.802 --> 14:08.013
but Futomomo is trying his hardest.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.267
He never slacks off.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.896
So you're a zookeeper?

14:16.188 --> 14:17.022
In that case,

14:17.523 --> 14:20.484
think of how to tame your animal.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.613
Come on, don't say that!

14:25.030 --> 14:29.034
Yeah, but tomorrow's the mock battle.
I don't think we should drink.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.080
Hey! You there!

14:33.747 --> 14:35.749
If I remember correctly...

14:35.916 --> 14:36.750
El, right?

14:36.834 --> 14:37.668
Yeah.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.129
Oh, so you were drinking?

14:40.212 --> 14:42.840
Wanna go back in for another round?

14:42.923 --> 14:45.676
-But--
-We should strengthen our camaraderie.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.888
Especially since I'll be
the aggressor tomorrow.

14:49.597 --> 14:50.431
Huh?

14:51.140 --> 14:54.518
I didn't come to Gifu
to play games and make friends.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.145
If you'll excuse me.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.149
Z-Zaito?

15:00.357 --> 15:04.570
Do you know the strategy...
for capturing prideful women?

15:04.862 --> 15:05.696
What?

15:06.238 --> 15:08.157
Once you've pierced a hole in their armor,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.951
just keep beating through
till you wear them down!

15:11.952 --> 15:14.246
It's settled!
This is no time for drinking.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.539
I'm gonna hit the gym.

15:15.706 --> 15:16.540
See ya!

15:16.832 --> 15:17.750
Woo hoo!

15:17.833 --> 15:19.960
He's frightening in more ways than one...

15:23.047 --> 15:25.049
I will now begin the briefing.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.093
Amakasu! Explain the conditions
for training completion.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.178
Y-Yes, sir!

15:29.345 --> 15:35.392
Hitomi's transport and Kinutsugai's AWACS
aircraft are to avoid being shot down,

15:35.476 --> 15:39.939
while Hoshino and my fighter jets
will escort them to ensure safe passage.

15:40.105 --> 15:44.193
Good! HAVCAP must make instant decisions,
so cooperation is vital!

15:44.735 --> 15:46.695
Zaito and Onaga will be the aggressors!

15:47.112 --> 15:49.615
Sorry, but I'm not gonna hold back.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.701
If you don't,
the mock battle would be obsolete.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.913
Wahoo! I'm getting all fired up dammit!

15:55.996 --> 15:56.914
Shut the hell up!

16:11.762 --> 16:12.596
Listen up.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.391
Maintain formation
and proceed slowly as planned.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.850
Yes, sir.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.228
I should stay out of Hoshino's way.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.691
I'm not Hitomi, but I don't want someone
badmouthing Masotan either.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.405
<i>Are you ready, Long?</i>

16:29.822 --> 16:32.700
<i>Attack on sight. No holding back!</i>

16:32.783 --> 16:33.659
<i>You got it!</i>

16:35.285 --> 16:37.705
Contact. Compass 320.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.206
Distance at 26 miles.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.459
Elevation at 30,000.
Eagle, two aircraft. Hostile.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.211
Already?

16:44.294 --> 16:46.088
<i>Shall we change course?</i>

16:46.171 --> 16:47.798
What should we do, Hoshino?

16:49.008 --> 16:49.842
<i>What?</i>

16:53.721 --> 16:55.014
I'll draw the enemy away.

16:55.097 --> 16:55.931
<i>What?</i>

16:56.015 --> 16:58.559
<i>You three maintain formation</i>
<i>and proceed as normal!</i>

16:58.767 --> 16:59.768
Hoshino!

17:00.269 --> 17:02.062
Taking off on her own...

17:02.146 --> 17:04.314
Let's just see what happens
for the time being.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.693
-What are you--
-The main purpose of this mock battle

17:08.068 --> 17:11.989
is to let the Dragon Pilots take action
to achieve their goal.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.991
Tally-ho!

17:14.450 --> 17:16.243
They're coming to greet us?

17:16.368 --> 17:18.662
They're really making it fun for us.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.373
<i>Are you really going to beat through them?</i>

17:21.457 --> 17:22.583
Of course!

17:22.708 --> 17:24.501
<i>I'll tear their pride to shreds,</i>

17:24.877 --> 17:28.505
<i>and when they compromise,</i>
<i>that's when it's fever time!</i>

17:53.072 --> 17:55.240
<i>Let's distance ourselves</i>
<i>from them while we can.</i>

17:55.324 --> 17:56.158
<i>Okay!</i>

18:24.103 --> 18:26.146
I will not lose.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.149
<i>From other Dragon Pilots</i>
<i>or any other pilot!</i>

18:29.483 --> 18:32.986
And I will show you all...
that I will become...

18:33.570 --> 18:34.738
the first penguin!

18:37.074 --> 18:38.325
-What?
-Huh?

18:39.743 --> 18:41.662
-What's wrong, Hoshino?
-<i>I'm fine!</i>

18:41.745 --> 18:43.163
Fine, my ass!

18:43.288 --> 18:44.790
Tell me what's happening!

18:44.873 --> 18:46.875
<i>I said I'm fine!</i>

18:46.959 --> 18:48.836
-Hey, Hoshino!
-Flight Leader Maezawa!

18:49.169 --> 18:51.839
Senior Master Sergeant Hoshino's
OTF's tail is exposed!

18:52.047 --> 18:52.965
What?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.967
<i>Hoshino, return to base immediately!</i>

18:55.050 --> 18:57.553
-No!
-<i>You're entering a golf course air field!</i>

18:57.636 --> 19:00.097
-<i>If a civilian sees you--</i>
-I'll figure it out!

19:00.180 --> 19:01.348
<i>You idiot!</i>

19:01.431 --> 19:02.683
<i>That's an order!</i>

19:02.933 --> 19:03.892
<i>Hoshino!</i>

19:03.976 --> 19:05.686
-<i>Are you listening to me?</i>
<i>-</i>No...

19:06.395 --> 19:07.229
No!

19:07.646 --> 19:09.189
Not here... not now...

19:09.314 --> 19:10.524
<i>Hoshino!</i>

19:11.150 --> 19:13.193
No!!

19:45.142 --> 19:47.519
I understand what she wanted.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.520
But...

19:49.605 --> 19:51.857
to think she'd have to go this far...

19:52.441 --> 19:53.734
Why didn't you stop her?

19:53.859 --> 19:55.277
M-Maezawa, please...

19:55.360 --> 19:56.486
You knew...

19:56.570 --> 19:58.572
that Hoshino's F-2 had a problem!

19:58.947 --> 20:01.491
And you still let her do
the joint training!

20:05.120 --> 20:05.954
Um...

20:06.371 --> 20:07.372
The worst...

20:07.456 --> 20:08.290
What?

20:08.373 --> 20:09.499
This is the worst!

20:11.793 --> 20:13.795
It was just an animal after all.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.883
It ignored my orders
and transformed on its own!

20:18.967 --> 20:20.385
I am a pilot!

20:20.761 --> 20:22.638
-I'm not a zookeeper!
-W-Wait...

20:23.013 --> 20:25.891
I don't need a piece of junk like that!

20:28.060 --> 20:29.603
Oh, um...

20:29.728 --> 20:31.730
How should I put this...

20:34.066 --> 20:35.692
Well...

20:36.652 --> 20:39.613
Dragons... are not things.

20:42.866 --> 20:43.909
Wipe, wipe.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.579
Grab, grab. Hurry, hurry.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.626
W-What... What's with her?

20:53.669 --> 20:56.004
It's true that they shouldn't be treated
as things.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.172
Huh?

20:57.256 --> 21:00.926
Besides, the shortcomings of an F-2
lies with the Dragon Pilot.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.513
If you call F-2 a piece of junk,
then you're a piece of junk too!

21:05.430 --> 21:08.058
I understand well the desire
to turn away from reality,

21:08.141 --> 21:11.019
But that only delays
facing the real problem--

21:13.438 --> 21:14.898
I was just joking!

21:14.982 --> 21:15.983
Uh...

21:16.066 --> 21:18.402
You had a valid point too.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.737
You're mocking me, aren't you?

21:20.821 --> 21:21.863
True, true.

21:26.910 --> 21:27.995
Wait!

21:32.207 --> 21:34.042
And then, there was no one.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.585
Kinutsugai?

21:35.669 --> 21:39.631
I will be gone in a minute as well.
I want to use the bathroom.

21:40.507 --> 21:43.260
By the way, that was pretty bad.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.054
What you said to Hoshino

21:46.179 --> 21:49.474
would be enough to make me want to die.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.768
I was just trying to get along
with every--

21:51.852 --> 21:54.354
Oh. I'm 20 seconds overdue.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.566
I would certainly die
if I peed myself here.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.734
Farewell.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.158
I... I...

22:07.284 --> 22:08.118
I am...

22:08.869 --> 22:11.580
the absolute worst!!

22:14.374 --> 22:15.542
This is the best.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.672
I can say it's actually
a better development.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.633
Vice-Minister Iiboshi, in that case--

22:23.759 --> 22:27.929
Yes. We cannot let
such a good opportunity slip away.

22:28.680 --> 22:33.602
We must turn our attention to the future
government and get to the bottom of it.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.481
Τhe true connection between OTF and pilot.

22:38.523 --> 22:42.652
The OTF acknowledge only one point
of commonality in those girls.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.907
White Lover.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.993
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.876 --> 24:24.796
-Nothing, nothing, there's nothing here.
-What are you doing!

24:24.880 --> 24:26.923
Bam bada bam bada bam bam...

24:27.007 --> 24:28.300
Fever, fever!

24:28.383 --> 24:30.302
Everyone is mocking me.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.095
They're trying to cheer you up!

24:32.179 --> 24:33.472
That's a lie.
