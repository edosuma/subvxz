<i>Hello.</i>

00:19.177 --> 00:20.780
<i>My name is Dylan.</i>

00:21.513 --> 00:24.116
<i>Um...</i>

00:24.149 --> 00:28.855
<i>So, I've been following this
wolf group for about...</i>

00:28.888 --> 00:30.757
<i>Three months.</i>

00:30.790 --> 00:32.759
<i>Really enjoying the community.</i>

00:32.792 --> 00:33.860
<i>And the content.</i>

00:35.929 --> 00:38.631
<i>I've wanted to become
an official member of the group</i>

00:38.665 --> 00:42.501
<i>for quite some time,
so tomorrow,</i>

00:42.535 --> 00:45.170
<i>I will begin the hunt.</i>

00:46.706 --> 00:47.740
<i>This girl.</i>

00:49.042 --> 00:50.108
<i>Heather.</i>

00:50.910 --> 00:52.444
<i>And her two friends.</i>

00:53.913 --> 00:56.950
<i>Her handle is @theheatherlife.</i>

00:56.983 --> 00:59.986
<i>She's a lifestyle influencer.</i>

01:00.019 --> 01:02.855
<i>She's already got
17,000 followers</i>

01:02.889 --> 01:04.156
<i>and is growing steadily,</i>

01:04.189 --> 01:06.391
<i>so you can go follow her, too.</i>

01:08.193 --> 01:09.729
<i>I've been following her...</i>

01:10.530 --> 01:12.464
<i>Online...</i>

01:12.497 --> 01:14.934
<i>And in person for a while.</i>

01:17.369 --> 01:20.773
<i>And I think that she will be
the perfect prey.</i>

01:30.315 --> 01:32.517
Hey, sorry,
I can't find my, uh...

01:33.485 --> 01:34.988
Yeah, I'll be there in one sec.

01:35.287 --> 01:38.323
No, I told you I don't have to
go back until Friday.

01:38.357 --> 01:39.424
I got the day off.

01:40.693 --> 01:42.127
Okay, I'll be there one sec.

01:43.563 --> 01:45.698
<i>As always,
any wolves in the area</i>

01:45.732 --> 01:48.067
<i>are more than welcome
to participate.</i>

01:52.538 --> 01:54.907
Have you see anything about
that pipeline in new Mexico?

01:56.208 --> 01:59.144
Um, not really.
What's happening?

02:00.178 --> 02:01.681
There she is.

02:02.782 --> 02:05.350
Lookin' fine as always.

02:06.953 --> 02:08.988
<i>I think this can be a...</i>

02:09.022 --> 02:10.990
<i>Really big moment</i>

02:11.024 --> 02:12.257
<i>for our brand...</i>

02:13.726 --> 02:16.629
<i>For... our movement.</i>

02:19.532 --> 02:21.134
<i>And for our community.</i>

03:30.636 --> 03:33.973
<i>Last road trip
with my number ones.</i>

03:37.777 --> 03:39.545
<i>Friggin' leaving me,</i>

03:39.579 --> 03:41.914
<i>so I need to hear a "whoo"
on three.</i>

03:41.948 --> 03:45.151
<i>- One, two, three.
- Whoo!</i>

03:49.387 --> 03:52.324
<i>- One, two, three.
- Whoo!</i>

03:55.595 --> 03:57.362
<i>What do you think?</i>

03:57.395 --> 03:59.132
<i>Think of what?</i>

03:59.165 --> 04:00.933
<i>The yearly retreat.</i>

04:02.400 --> 04:03.502
Let's go, Heather.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.508
- This is disgusting.
- What?

04:09.542 --> 04:12.011
The protest in new Mexico.
We should go there right now.

04:12.945 --> 04:14.747
Um, I don't think that Heather's
gonna be into

04:14.781 --> 04:17.016
another two hour drive to
new Mexico.

04:18.084 --> 04:19.752
God, this is beyond fucked.

04:20.953 --> 04:22.633
I shouldn't be here.
I should be with them.

04:22.955 --> 04:24.657
Didn't you get maced last year?

04:24.991 --> 04:27.059
Yeah. Cops were
fucking assholes.

04:27.693 --> 04:29.896
And weren't you in the hospital
for, like, two days?

04:30.730 --> 04:32.297
Yeah, I was. Why?

04:33.032 --> 04:34.901
Maybe you oughta...

04:36.569 --> 04:38.037
What?

04:38.070 --> 04:40.273
I don't know, maybe you don't
want to put yourself...

04:40.773 --> 04:42.141
Say it. What do you mean?

04:43.475 --> 04:44.644
Nothing.

04:44.677 --> 04:46.646
No, Sam. Put myself where?

04:47.146 --> 04:48.281
Nothing.

04:54.153 --> 04:56.556
That's the first passerby
in ten minutes.

05:10.069 --> 05:11.469
What the fuck is he doing?

05:13.906 --> 05:15.407
Sorry, guys.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.375
Shitty bladder.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.023
Is he watching us?

05:33.491 --> 05:35.127
Heather.

05:35.427 --> 05:38.965
Relax. It's not like we've never
seen creeps on this trip before.

05:41.499 --> 05:43.169
Maybe we should just go.

05:44.971 --> 05:46.806
Riley. Let's go.

05:58.351 --> 06:00.385
Sick fucking truck, dude.

06:01.854 --> 06:05.658
Guess we've had our annual
redneck, small dick creep drive by.

06:08.928 --> 06:10.395
So fucked up.

06:11.898 --> 06:13.766
Well, then,
stop watching it, Riley.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.769
Okay, I'm gonna get
some supplies.

06:49.802 --> 06:51.170
Okay. I'll come with.

07:35.014 --> 07:36.382
Riley, don't.

07:37.016 --> 07:38.918
- Riley.
- What's that for?

07:38.951 --> 07:40.586
I'm just curious.

07:40.619 --> 07:43.189
How could you possibly justify
having that poster on your wall?

07:43.222 --> 07:44.757
Riley, can we please just go?

07:55.001 --> 07:57.236
- Riley, let's go.
- You get the fuck out of my store!

07:57.269 --> 07:59.550
- Fuck you and fuck your store!
- Get the fuck outta here!

08:01.574 --> 08:03.175
- What?
- You didn't have to do that.

08:03.209 --> 08:05.144
Oh, come on. You were thinking
the same thing.

08:05.177 --> 08:06.846
He shouldn't have that up
in his store.

08:07.113 --> 08:08.590
Well, you didn't have to
make a scene.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.716
Well, Sam, maybe we should
make a scene!

08:12.284 --> 08:14.720
- What?
- Nothing. Just forget it.

08:17.957 --> 08:19.291
What happened to you guys?

08:19.325 --> 08:20.626
Nothing, let's just go.

08:22.228 --> 08:23.896
Did you guys hear that
Jamie rennick died?

08:24.363 --> 08:25.765
- Jamie?
- Who?

08:26.932 --> 08:29.568
Uh, she was on me and Heather's
dorm floor freshman yeah.

08:29.935 --> 08:31.695
I feel like I should
post something about it.

08:32.204 --> 08:33.773
You never even liked her.

08:34.106 --> 08:36.675
She used to set the fire alarm
off 'cause she smoked so much.

08:36.709 --> 08:38.944
Yeah, she was annoying
but we were friends.

08:40.012 --> 08:41.547
Did you say she was murdered?

08:41.580 --> 08:42.615
Yeah.

08:44.450 --> 08:45.618
Poor Jamie.

08:45.651 --> 08:46.886
Do they know who did it?

08:47.386 --> 08:49.655
No, but it's probably one of
those assholes she dates.

08:50.156 --> 08:52.000
She dated two consecutive
psychos freshman year.

08:52.024 --> 08:53.584
She had to call the cops
on one of them.

08:53.893 --> 08:54.960
Does it say?

08:55.194 --> 08:56.796
No, but I bet
that's what it was.

08:57.531 --> 08:58.597
Fuck.

08:59.732 --> 09:02.435
I mean, at some point,
you kind of expect it.

09:03.869 --> 09:04.970
What?

09:05.704 --> 09:07.773
I mean, like,
she would always go to bars

09:07.807 --> 09:09.575
and look for
the biggest psycho there

09:09.608 --> 09:11.444
and hook up with him
just for attention.

09:12.111 --> 09:14.146
- So you're saying she deserved it?
- No!

09:15.014 --> 09:16.215
No, I'm just sayin'.

09:16.248 --> 09:18.484
Can we just not talk about this?

09:18.517 --> 09:19.553
Yeah, good idea.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.524
Let's enjoy this a/c
while we have it.

10:05.931 --> 10:07.800
We're here. Woo!

10:09.536 --> 10:11.571
Drive was fuckin' long.

10:14.974 --> 10:17.476
It is so fuckin' hot.

10:17.676 --> 10:19.678
It's August. What do you expect?

10:21.514 --> 10:23.282
But is it always this hot?

10:23.649 --> 10:25.384
Oh,
please don't complain the whole time.

10:27.486 --> 10:29.455
Sunscreen.
Does anyone need sunscreen?

10:29.488 --> 10:32.592
Yes, please.
Frickin' fried last year.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.694
Sam, please tell me
you brought your inhaler.

10:36.162 --> 10:37.229
Got it, mom.

10:39.165 --> 10:40.232
Okay.

10:40.266 --> 10:41.901
Let's go.

10:45.704 --> 10:47.006
At least this is better than

10:47.039 --> 10:49.341
when you dragged us to Star Trek
freshman year.

10:49.543 --> 10:51.510
Yes.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.412
Okay, cool.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.649
Come on. That was rough.

10:55.681 --> 10:57.816
- You know that was rough.
- That's embarrassing.

11:18.771 --> 11:21.207
Hello!
We're out here in the wilderness,

11:21.240 --> 11:23.008
it is very hot,

11:23.042 --> 11:25.744
and we're about half a mile in
and having lots of fun.

11:25.778 --> 11:27.112
- Right guys?
- Mm.

11:27.746 --> 11:29.215
Are you gonna do that
the whole time?

11:29.348 --> 11:31.651
- Do what?
- Make those videos.

11:32.151 --> 11:33.553
Not the whole time, but, yeah.

11:34.453 --> 11:36.590
You're so into this influencer stuff
now, aren't you?

11:36.623 --> 11:38.658
Okay, hey, it pays the bills.

11:38.692 --> 11:41.360
There's a skincare product line
that literally pays me $100

11:41.393 --> 11:44.029
- just to use their stuff.
- Oh, high roller!

11:44.430 --> 11:46.398
Do you even like the products
you're promoting?

11:46.432 --> 11:48.467
Sometimes, but, hey,

11:48.500 --> 11:50.836
it's better than that weed store
you work at.

11:50.936 --> 11:53.239
It was a medical marijuana
dispensary.

11:54.608 --> 11:56.909
- Speaking of which...
- Oh, no. No, no no, not for me.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.679
- Should we repeat last year's adventure?
- Oh, god.

12:00.012 --> 12:01.548
- Sam!
- No.

12:02.414 --> 12:03.916
Wait. I don't want to
do it alone.

12:03.949 --> 12:06.151
Nope. That shit
makes me feel weird.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.020
Sammy?

12:09.188 --> 12:10.489
Maybe later.

12:11.357 --> 12:13.225
Okay. Fine.

12:13.727 --> 12:15.160
I'm just gonna take one.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.563
I thought you were quitting?

12:17.496 --> 12:19.164
No. Definitely not.

12:19.198 --> 12:20.667
They're gonna let
your stoner ass

12:20.700 --> 12:21.967
bring that shit to Senegal?

12:22.535 --> 12:24.169
Probably not.

12:24.203 --> 12:25.804
Gotta make the most of it.

12:26.972 --> 12:28.812
What about you, Sam,
do you still smoke at all?

12:29.208 --> 12:30.843
Sometimes,
but it makes me paranoid.

12:31.143 --> 12:32.311
Oh, my god.

12:33.178 --> 12:35.447
I remember when
I gave you two edibles,

12:35.682 --> 12:38.551
and you locked yourself in the
bathroom for, like, three hours.

12:38.585 --> 12:40.352
It was not three hours.

12:40.386 --> 12:42.955
- Oh, my god.
- Yes, it was. We were all worried.

12:42.988 --> 12:44.790
But Sam's always been
a scaredy-cat.

12:44.823 --> 12:47.423
That's probably why she took all
those fighting classes last year.

12:47.527 --> 12:49.629
Uh, no.
That was because of Ralph.

12:53.533 --> 12:55.968
Um, have you heard from him
recently?

12:56.569 --> 12:59.271
No, the restraining order
shut him up, funnily enough.

13:01.373 --> 13:03.142
- He was a nightmare.
- Yep.

13:04.644 --> 13:06.011
Is he still in that apartment?

13:07.647 --> 13:10.282
His parents made him move.

13:10.684 --> 13:12.851
And then he started seeing
a therapist or something

13:12.885 --> 13:15.220
and now he's in Denver,
at least that's what I heard.

13:15.354 --> 13:17.724
Well, at least he's
not bothering you anymore.

13:18.324 --> 13:19.391
Yep.

13:21.661 --> 13:23.797
Have I mentioned
how fucking hot it is?

13:23.829 --> 13:26.465
Oh, my god! This is why
we called you "heat."

13:27.399 --> 13:29.168
No. No, no, no, no, no.

13:29.201 --> 13:30.936
They... you guys called me heat

13:30.969 --> 13:34.273
because those boys freshman year
thought I was a "smoke show."

13:34.306 --> 13:36.442
Oh, my god, no!

13:36.576 --> 13:38.444
They called you heat because
you used to

13:38.477 --> 13:40.412
sweat through your shirt
at every party.

13:40.446 --> 13:42.047
Bullshit!

13:42.081 --> 13:44.083
No, that's definitely
what is was. Right, Sam?

13:44.116 --> 13:45.484
I don't remember.

13:45.517 --> 13:47.119
No, that... that's it.

13:47.152 --> 13:48.220
Yeah.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.975
You guys.

15:17.242 --> 15:18.377
Let's stop for a sec.

15:21.915 --> 15:24.016
I think this place
gets hotter every year.

15:25.384 --> 15:26.920
Fucking global warming.

15:26.952 --> 15:28.454
I bet you that guy at
the gas station

15:28.487 --> 15:29.656
doesn't even believe in it.

15:31.023 --> 15:33.025
Do either of you guys have
a portable charger?

15:33.325 --> 15:34.627
Yeah. I got you.

15:40.567 --> 15:41.634
Thanks.

15:42.769 --> 15:45.170
Damn. You get really good
reception out here.

15:51.611 --> 15:53.880
- That's weird.
- What?

15:54.346 --> 15:56.482
Just got a dm, "I see you."

15:56.649 --> 15:57.784
From who?

15:59.184 --> 16:00.854
That can't be the first time.

16:00.954 --> 16:03.656
Don't you have, like,
15,000 followers now?

16:03.890 --> 16:06.860
17,000, and yeah,
I get weirdos all the time.

16:08.026 --> 16:10.964
- He sent a pic, too.
- Ew. Delete it.

16:10.996 --> 16:13.031
No, no, no,
just one of the woods.

16:16.769 --> 16:17.937
Where is that?

16:18.571 --> 16:20.272
I don't know. Looks like here.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.610
That's weird. Did he say
anything else?

16:24.076 --> 16:25.310
Nope.

16:25.812 --> 16:27.346
Fuck off, creep.

16:27.814 --> 16:29.281
It's probably just some weirdo.

16:29.314 --> 16:31.951
I get weird messages from
creepy dudes all the time.

16:32.685 --> 16:34.186
Well, at least it wasn't
a dick pic.

16:34.219 --> 16:36.154
Oh, I can make
a coffee table book

16:36.188 --> 16:38.156
- with all those that I've gotten.
- Oh, my god.

16:39.157 --> 16:41.561
- Do you guys think...
- What?

16:42.729 --> 16:45.097
No, it's probably just some
weirdo that saw my story.

16:45.598 --> 16:47.567
- But how would they...
- What?

16:47.600 --> 16:49.268
No. Fuck that.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.203
We're not gonna let some creep
ruin our trip.

16:51.236 --> 16:53.006
That's the fuckin' spirit.

16:58.510 --> 16:59.812
Just gets heavier and heavier.

16:59.846 --> 17:02.281
Hotter and hotter.

17:04.984 --> 17:06.553
Okay, it's time.

17:10.023 --> 17:11.256
Oh, god.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.425
Hello!

17:21.935 --> 17:23.603
<i>We've broken a sweat.</i>

17:23.636 --> 17:26.606
<i>I'm here with Riley.
Say hi, Riley.</i>

17:26.639 --> 17:27.907
<i>Hi, Riley.</i>

17:27.941 --> 17:30.275
<i>And my other best, Sam.</i>

17:31.443 --> 17:33.111
<i>Hi.</i>

17:33.145 --> 17:34.847
<i>They're really happy,
you just can't tell.</i>

17:36.683 --> 17:39.251
<i>Okay, mile four,</i>

17:39.284 --> 17:41.688
<i>and we're really starting
to feel the heat.</i>

17:41.721 --> 17:43.590
<i>How are you doing, Riley?</i>

17:43.623 --> 17:45.090
<i>My sports bra...</i>

17:45.123 --> 17:47.961
<i>Mile five down.</i>

17:47.994 --> 17:50.530
<i>My girl slam
lookin' fine as always.</i>

17:52.097 --> 17:55.400
<i>Mile six and we're takin'
a little break.</i>

17:55.434 --> 17:57.235
<i>Sam is havin' a little nap.</i>

17:57.269 --> 17:58.738
<i>- Fuck off.
- Ooh!</i>

18:00.006 --> 18:03.241
<i>- How is that?
- This apple?</i>

18:03.275 --> 18:04.687
<i>The best apple
I think I've ever had.</i>

18:04.711 --> 18:06.144
<i>- Ever had?
- Mm-hm.</i>

18:06.178 --> 18:07.379
<i>Okay.</i>

18:30.135 --> 18:32.105
<i>You all good?</i>

18:32.137 --> 18:33.640
<i>Been havin' radio trouble
all day.</i>

18:35.942 --> 18:37.442
Hey, uh,

18:37.476 --> 18:39.679
how many hunting licenses
did we give out this season?

18:40.780 --> 18:42.849
<i>Uh, 20, I think.</i>

18:44.617 --> 18:47.486
We give out any, uh, like,
crossbow hunting licenses?

18:48.821 --> 18:50.522
<i>Bow hunting?</i>

18:50.556 --> 18:52.592
<i>No, not that I know of. Why?</i>

18:53.826 --> 18:55.460
Yeah, you might want to call
the county.

18:55.494 --> 18:58.131
We could have
a poaching situation.

18:58.163 --> 19:00.033
<i>Is he hunting
or just target practice?</i>

19:04.037 --> 19:06.806
Yeah, it might just be
target practice.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.608
But I'll ask him.

19:10.242 --> 19:11.811
<i>All right. Find out
and let me know.</i>

19:28.728 --> 19:29.762
<i>Jake?</i>

19:30.663 --> 19:31.698
<i>Jake, you still there?</i>

19:33.533 --> 19:35.367
<i>Jake?</i>

19:36.736 --> 19:38.004
<i>Jake, you still there?</i>

20:28.187 --> 20:30.422
- What the hell?
- Where's the fucking lake?

20:30.823 --> 20:33.358
- Fuck.
- This is the spot, right?

20:33.391 --> 20:34.894
Yeah, this is it.

20:35.393 --> 20:37.230
Why is it so dry?

20:37.997 --> 20:39.766
Climate change, that's why.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.467
Less snowfall means less water.

20:43.301 --> 20:44.570
Fucking bullshit.

20:49.407 --> 20:51.110
Fuck it. I'm going in.

20:51.811 --> 20:54.547
- What? In that?
- Yeah, it's hot.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.051
- Come on.
- Fuck that.

21:01.187 --> 21:03.321
Sammy. Come on.

21:08.828 --> 21:10.530
It's so hot.

21:11.864 --> 21:13.199
Get in the lake, then.

21:21.941 --> 21:23.576
Whoo!

21:32.350 --> 21:34.020
Whoo!

21:56.576 --> 21:57.877
Someone's watching us.

22:00.813 --> 22:02.048
That's weird.

22:06.552 --> 22:07.753
Whoo!

22:09.155 --> 22:10.556
Someone's watching us.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.268
That's weird.

22:22.735 --> 22:24.103
What was that?

22:24.904 --> 22:26.639
Oh, that's fucking weird.

22:27.974 --> 22:30.475
Did you see his face?
It looked like he's wearing a mask.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.712
A mask? Looks like a hat.

22:32.945 --> 22:34.647
He's fucking creepy.

22:35.314 --> 22:37.434
Hey, my phone's on low.
Do you have the phone charger?

22:37.984 --> 22:40.219
I gave that to Riley.

22:41.187 --> 22:42.255
Oh, my god.

22:42.889 --> 22:45.358
Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

22:45.390 --> 22:46.959
Yeah, you go in the puddle
with it.

22:46.993 --> 22:48.493
Oh, great.

22:48.527 --> 22:50.005
- So this means we can't charge?
- Nope.

22:50.029 --> 22:52.365
- I was only at 25 percent.
- I'm at 35.

22:56.202 --> 22:57.737
Heather.

22:57.770 --> 22:59.681
Maybe you shouldn't do that.
Isn't your phone gonna die?

22:59.705 --> 23:01.007
I'm gonna use this for stories.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.507
We can use Sam's
for emergencies.

23:05.443 --> 23:08.981
Hello, here we are
at mile... seven?

23:09.015 --> 23:10.917
- Seven and a half.
- Seven and a half,

23:10.950 --> 23:13.953
and we've made it to this once
beautiful, beautiful oasis

23:13.986 --> 23:16.589
that is now
a giant pit of despair.

23:16.622 --> 23:18.767
But it's okay, 'cause I'm still
with my gorgeous friends.

23:18.791 --> 23:20.559
- Say hi, Sam.
- Can you not right now?

23:20.593 --> 23:21.861
Okay, well...

23:22.261 --> 23:23.428
You just ruined it.

23:26.498 --> 23:29.001
Hello! Here we are
at mile seven and a half,

23:29.035 --> 23:30.703
and we're at what used to be

23:30.736 --> 23:32.772
the most gorgeous,
gorgeous oasis,

23:32.805 --> 23:34.774
that is now
a giant pit of despair.

23:34.807 --> 23:36.609
But I'm with
my gorgeous friends,

23:36.642 --> 23:38.978
and Riley just ruined
my phone charger,

23:39.011 --> 23:40.980
so I'm a little bit upset
about that,

23:41.013 --> 23:42.548
and might be off the grid later.

23:42.682 --> 23:45.918
But, good news is,
we're only about three...

23:45.952 --> 23:47.620
- Three miles.
- Three miles

23:47.653 --> 23:50.156
until we get to our
favorite spot to camp

23:50.189 --> 23:51.857
where someday, people will build

23:51.891 --> 23:53.726
a giant statue of
the three of us,

23:53.759 --> 23:56.929
and it will be bronze
and it will be beautiful.

24:00.066 --> 24:01.133
Okay, let's go.

24:10.242 --> 24:12.311
Okay, I don't care
if the lake is dry,

24:12.345 --> 24:14.714
we are still getting
a fucking picture.

24:15.414 --> 24:17.049
Oh, Heather is serious.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.617
She's brining out the tripod.

24:18.651 --> 24:20.853
How else are we gonna get
a picture of the three of us?

24:21.620 --> 24:23.589
Is that what this is all for,
the picture?

24:24.457 --> 24:25.925
No.

24:26.392 --> 24:27.893
No, Sam.

24:27.927 --> 24:29.462
It's for the stories, too.

24:29.662 --> 24:31.673
It's gonna take three.
It's gonna take in five seconds.

24:31.697 --> 24:32.898
Hurry up, guys.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.201
Come on, come on, come on.

24:44.944 --> 24:46.645
Perfect. Let's see.

24:52.885 --> 24:55.821
Oh, my god, yes. One of these
is definitely post-able.

25:02.895 --> 25:04.030
Shall we?

25:05.398 --> 25:06.866
Tripod.

25:06.932 --> 25:08.200
Oh!

25:33.759 --> 25:35.961
- No.
- Come on, Riley.

25:35.995 --> 25:37.296
You know you want to.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.865
I am not singing
that fucking song.

25:40.266 --> 25:43.002

26:11.497 --> 26:12.932
you guys remember that song.

26:13.666 --> 26:15.835
Didn't we make it up
at that freshman year...

26:15.868 --> 26:17.571
We were at that frat house?

26:17.603 --> 26:20.106
Oh, yeah, you were
super ill in the bathroom.

26:20.139 --> 26:22.741
We were just trying to cheer you up,

26:23.109 --> 26:25.277
made up that stupid song,

26:25.845 --> 26:28.247
and the next thing we know,
the whole house is singing it.

26:29.815 --> 26:31.217
We should all get a tattoo.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.818
On our asses.

26:32.852 --> 26:34.186
That's the last thing
we should do

26:34.220 --> 26:35.321
before you guys leave.

26:36.188 --> 26:37.389
When do you leave, Sam?

26:37.523 --> 26:39.425
Uh, my flight
is booked for the 28th.

26:40.693 --> 26:42.061
What about you, Riley?

26:43.095 --> 26:44.196
Twenty-ninth.

26:44.864 --> 26:45.931
Fuck.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.834
Yeah. End of an era.

26:48.968 --> 26:50.136
Yep.

26:51.237 --> 26:53.105
You guys gotta visit me, though.
Both of you.

26:54.273 --> 26:55.341
Me, too.

26:55.374 --> 26:58.545
Well, Boston sounds cool, but...

26:58.578 --> 26:59.979
Senegal?

27:00.079 --> 27:02.848
No. I mean,
they give us time off.

27:03.249 --> 27:06.152
We could, like, meet up in...

27:06.185 --> 27:07.621
Germany?

27:07.653 --> 27:09.955
Oh, fuck yeah, Germany.

27:09.989 --> 27:12.491
So, what kind of stuff are you
gonna be doing in Senegal?

27:13.159 --> 27:14.960
Lots of building.

27:14.994 --> 27:17.429
Uh, creating fresh,
clean water sources.

27:17.763 --> 27:20.032
We're gonna be working with
schools and hospitals.

27:21.767 --> 27:23.102
Guys.

27:23.537 --> 27:24.670
He's back.

27:28.274 --> 27:30.009
Oh, come on. This guy again!

27:31.310 --> 27:33.710
Heather, you should probably flash him.
That's what he wants.

27:34.013 --> 27:35.481
Hey, asshole!

27:35.514 --> 27:38.150
You think you're real cute
with your creeper camo act?

27:38.350 --> 27:40.620
I want you to know that
my girl, Sam, here

27:40.654 --> 27:42.321
is a kickboxing badass,

27:42.354 --> 27:45.324
and she has her black belt in
beating up creeps like you.

27:45.357 --> 27:47.059
So if you come any closer,

27:47.092 --> 27:49.461
you're leading yourself into
a world of pain.

27:58.938 --> 28:00.574
Kickboxing badass?

28:00.773 --> 28:02.074
It's all about perception.

28:07.179 --> 28:10.416
Oh, that's real cute!
Yeah, we're so scared.

28:10.449 --> 28:13.185
Lotta balls on a guy
to message a girl anonymously.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.154
That's fucking creepy.

28:16.188 --> 28:17.691
Blocked.

28:17.723 --> 28:20.726
And that's how you deal with
a creeper asshole, ladies.

28:20.759 --> 28:22.828
You should have filmed that.

28:22.861 --> 28:25.040
That was the most interesting
thing you've done all day.

28:25.064 --> 28:26.398
Shit! You're right.

28:26.432 --> 28:27.866
You think he'll do it again?

28:32.938 --> 28:34.807
What the fuck!
That could have hit us.

28:35.874 --> 28:38.277
Hey, motherfucker,
that wasn't fucking funny!

28:38.310 --> 28:39.979
Heather!

28:40.012 --> 28:41.957
- Come back here, you asshole prick!
- Heather, wait.

28:41.981 --> 28:44.116
Swear to god,
I'll kill you if I see you again,

28:44.149 --> 28:46.720
- you tiny dick fuck!
- Heather, we shouldn't split up.

29:14.780 --> 29:15.814
Heather.

29:15.848 --> 29:17.550
That was fucking bullshit,
Riley.

29:17.584 --> 29:19.451
- You're right.
- No, that could have hit us.

29:19.485 --> 29:21.053
It was two feet from Sam's head.

29:21.453 --> 29:23.355
But you scared him off.
He's gone now.

29:23.389 --> 29:24.890
We have to go back to Sam.

29:25.692 --> 29:26.859
Come on.

29:30.229 --> 29:32.331
Okay, I think
we need to head back.

29:32.364 --> 29:35.200
What? Head back just because of
this asshole creep?

29:35.735 --> 29:37.336
He shot an arrow at us.

29:37.369 --> 29:39.104
Well, it wasn't at us.

29:39.138 --> 29:40.973
Are you kidding me?
It was right there.

29:45.811 --> 29:47.846
It's gonna get dark soon.
We should head back.

29:48.514 --> 29:50.883
I don't think we're gonna
make it to the car before dark.

29:51.751 --> 29:53.185
Can we call a cop or something?

29:53.485 --> 29:55.555
Fuck the cops,
they're not gonna come out here.

29:55.954 --> 29:57.823
We should just call
the forest service,

29:57.856 --> 30:00.627
and tell them there's a guy
that's shooting arrows at hikers.

30:02.027 --> 30:03.062
Okay.

30:04.029 --> 30:05.230
I'm at ten percent.

30:05.264 --> 30:06.700
I'm at 14. I can call.

30:15.642 --> 30:17.109
Della county forest.

30:17.142 --> 30:20.312
Hi, um, me and two of my friends
have been hiking on...

30:20.346 --> 30:22.257
- The Bennet trail for a while.
- On the Bennet trail,

30:22.281 --> 30:25.042
and we would... we would like to
report that somebody just shot at us.

30:25.184 --> 30:26.653
You were shot at?

30:26.686 --> 30:28.420
<i>Yes. We think you should
send a ranger.</i>

30:29.288 --> 30:30.757
Wait. Someone shot at you
with a gun?

30:31.390 --> 30:34.159
No, um, with an arrow.

30:34.193 --> 30:35.361
<i>An arrow? Is anyone hurt?</i>

30:36.161 --> 30:38.364
No, he missed us.
He... he wasn't aiming at us.

30:38.397 --> 30:40.734
But can you please
just send a ranger?

30:40.767 --> 30:41.801
<i>So wait.</i>

30:42.368 --> 30:44.002
Nobody was hurt.

30:44.036 --> 30:46.171
<i>No, but...</i>

30:46.205 --> 30:47.540
<i>He was trying to hurt us.</i>

30:47.574 --> 30:48.974
Is he still trying to hurt you?

30:49.208 --> 30:50.810
No, he disappeared.

30:50.976 --> 30:52.444
Can you please just send
a ranger?

30:53.011 --> 30:54.581
<i>Listen,</i>

30:54.614 --> 30:56.257
based on what you told me,
it sounds like you might have

30:56.281 --> 30:58.685
stumbled across somebody
doing target practice.

30:58.718 --> 31:00.352
<i>We advise that anyone
out in federal land</i>

31:00.386 --> 31:01.831
<i>let their presence be known
at all times</i>

31:01.855 --> 31:03.288
<i>to avoid any accidents.</i>

31:03.322 --> 31:05.124
This was not a fucking accident.

31:05.157 --> 31:06.593
<i>Someone shot at us!</i>

31:06.626 --> 31:08.227
Look, I understand you're upset.

31:08.260 --> 31:09.980
I'm just trying to get
accurate information.

31:10.162 --> 31:13.065
Look, he's gone now,
but could you please just sent a ranger?

31:13.533 --> 31:15.043
One of our rangers is
already out there,

31:15.067 --> 31:16.836
but I think his comm's
out of range.

31:16.870 --> 31:18.772
Once he gets back in range,

31:19.471 --> 31:20.939
I'll have him head your way.

31:20.973 --> 31:22.773
- You said you're off the Bennet trail?
- <i>Yes.</i>

31:23.142 --> 31:24.878
Okay. Thank you.

31:24.910 --> 31:26.746
<i>Once again,
there's a lot of hunters</i>

31:26.780 --> 31:28.490
<i>and a lot of people doing
target practice out there.</i>

31:28.514 --> 31:30.784
Just make sure your presence
is known at all times,

31:30.817 --> 31:31.950
and be safe.

31:32.484 --> 31:33.653
Okay. Thank you.

31:34.486 --> 31:35.555
Assholes!

31:36.288 --> 31:37.489
So, can we head back now?

31:38.023 --> 31:40.463
Yeah, but we're not gonna make
it back to the car before dark.

31:41.927 --> 31:43.730
Redneck motherfuckers!

31:44.831 --> 31:46.298
They're sending someone
to get us.

31:46.331 --> 31:48.100
Fucking assholes.

32:03.850 --> 32:06.553
Heather, don't.
You're battery's gonna die.

32:07.386 --> 32:10.022
Hello,
my nice respectful followers.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.691
Here with my friends,
Sam and Riley,

32:11.724 --> 32:14.293
and something not that cool
just happened.

32:14.326 --> 32:16.462
Basically, some random
asshole creeper,

32:16.495 --> 32:19.398
who I'm pretty sure has been
anonymously dming me all day,

32:19.431 --> 32:22.000
just shot a fucking arrow at us.

32:22.034 --> 32:23.435
Now why, may you ask,

32:23.469 --> 32:25.939
would someone shoot an arrow at
a group of people?

32:25.971 --> 32:28.340
I have a few theories.
Basically, I'm pretty sure

32:28.373 --> 32:30.375
he's some basement-dwelling
social reject

32:30.409 --> 32:31.921
who couldn't get a girl
to save his life.

32:31.945 --> 32:33.412
He's probably
sitting around moping

32:33.445 --> 32:34.890
wondering why he
doesn't get the respect

32:34.914 --> 32:36.850
he so feels entitled to.

32:37.082 --> 32:38.562
Well, I have
a little message for him.

32:38.685 --> 32:41.353
Fuck. You.
I know you're watching.

32:41.386 --> 32:43.989
I know you love to creep
and watch me share my life.

32:44.289 --> 32:47.059
Fuck off! If I ever figure out
who the fuck you are,

32:47.092 --> 32:49.394
I'm plastering your face
all over my account

32:49.428 --> 32:50.663
so that every girl...

32:50.697 --> 32:53.165
No, every person within
a 100 mile radius

32:53.198 --> 32:55.735
knows that you're a stupid
creeper asshole fuck.

32:58.972 --> 33:00.740
We can't let this ruin the trip.

33:00.773 --> 33:02.642
I know.
That's exactly what he wants.

33:05.678 --> 33:07.279
Why the fuck did you grab that?

33:07.312 --> 33:08.848
Uh, I don't know.

33:09.248 --> 33:11.651
Good. Keep it. You can
shove it up his ass later.

33:11.684 --> 33:13.553
Huh. Not a bad idea.

33:14.554 --> 33:16.121
We should really make camp soon.

33:16.154 --> 33:18.223
There's a good spot in,
like, half a mile.

33:20.292 --> 33:22.261
Maybe Heather will get
poison oak again.

33:23.262 --> 33:24.797
I forgot about that.
Wasn't that, like,

33:24.831 --> 33:26.533
the first year,
it was all over your leg?

33:28.233 --> 33:29.401
Heather?

33:31.571 --> 33:33.105
Heather, I'm pissed, too.

33:33.606 --> 33:35.440
That was a shitty,
shitty thing to do.

33:35.975 --> 33:38.043
But you're just giving him
what he wants.

33:38.845 --> 33:41.085
He's just trying to freak us out
and ruin the whole trip.

33:41.814 --> 33:43.016
Yeah.

33:45.552 --> 33:48.588
He's probably already back in
his mom's basement by now.

33:49.889 --> 33:51.290
Probably jerking off to some.

33:51.323 --> 33:53.458
<i>Transformers</i> Megan fox poster.

33:53.492 --> 33:54.694
Oh, my god.

33:55.327 --> 33:57.262
I did not need that image
back in my head.

33:58.263 --> 33:59.766
What? Explain.

34:00.198 --> 34:03.603
Remember Jeremy Stanton?
Lived below me sophomore year.

34:03.636 --> 34:05.203
- Yeah.
- Oh, my god.

34:05.237 --> 34:09.943
So, that fucker would like,
never, ever leave his room.

34:10.442 --> 34:12.745
And one day,
I get locked out of my place

34:12.779 --> 34:14.914
so I need to go through
his fire escape

34:14.948 --> 34:16.415
so I can get back up.

34:16.448 --> 34:18.283
And I knock on his door,

34:18.517 --> 34:22.154
and it's just
floor to ceiling pictures

34:22.187 --> 34:23.990
of Megan fox from <i>transfomers.</i>

34:24.122 --> 34:25.357
That's fucking bizarre.

34:25.390 --> 34:28.962
Oh, god, no, it was like
this 20 year old man

34:28.995 --> 34:33.032
with this creepy
"14 year old in 2007" obsession

34:33.066 --> 34:34.466
with Megan fox.

34:34.499 --> 34:36.836
It's so true.
I didn't believe Riley at first,

34:36.869 --> 34:39.072
so I went myself,
said I was lost,

34:39.438 --> 34:42.942
it was actually top five
creepiest things I've ever seen.

35:12.538 --> 35:14.107
It's getting colder.

35:14.741 --> 35:16.308
Yeah, always does.

35:17.977 --> 35:20.445
Hello, hello,
my beautiful followers.

35:20.479 --> 35:23.650
We have finally made it here
after a very long hike

35:23.683 --> 35:25.685
and a very shitty incident

35:25.718 --> 35:27.920
involving a very shitty person.

35:27.954 --> 35:30.489
But it's okay, because we're
here and I'm with my friends.

35:30.522 --> 35:32.491
And this is our...

35:38.531 --> 35:42.068
And because they can fit
in really small spaces,

35:42.101 --> 35:44.436
and...

35:47.740 --> 35:49.108
I'd be a dragon.

35:49.142 --> 35:52.444
Okay, I didn't know
we could do... it's not...

35:52.477 --> 35:54.814
Real animals.

35:54.847 --> 35:57.717
I would have chosen, like,
a centaur or something.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.351
Centaurs are half human.

36:37.857 --> 36:40.059
I wish I knew more about it.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.028
I'm a gemini.

36:43.261 --> 36:44.630
Wait.

36:44.664 --> 36:46.699
Do you think that, like...

36:46.733 --> 36:49.168
Millions of miles away...

36:49.202 --> 36:51.104
- No. No.
- Yeah. What?

36:51.137 --> 36:53.305
I can't. I'm too high. I can't.

36:53.973 --> 36:56.241
- What?
- I'm too high for that.

36:56.642 --> 36:58.945
But that's, like,
the best time to talk about it.

36:58.978 --> 37:02.280
No, I'm not ready for,
like, existential...

37:02.314 --> 37:04.984
We're all just like
little specks of dust

37:05.017 --> 37:07.352
in the universe.

37:07.486 --> 37:08.855
Whatever.

37:11.557 --> 37:13.192
Ralph used to talk about that.

37:15.995 --> 37:17.630
Whenever I was...

37:18.698 --> 37:19.899
Thinking he was lying

37:19.932 --> 37:22.168
or trying to convince me
I was crazy,

37:22.201 --> 37:25.337
he'd just bring up
the galaxies thing.

37:27.740 --> 37:28.975
About how...

37:29.474 --> 37:32.845
How small my fears and...

37:34.513 --> 37:36.149
Everything were when...

37:37.150 --> 37:39.752
You know, there were all these
fucking planets so far away

37:39.786 --> 37:42.021
and there could be
other life and...

37:43.556 --> 37:45.758
How he'd say
he was convinced that

37:45.792 --> 37:47.693
I didn't understand
my place in the universe,

37:47.727 --> 37:50.897
so how did I have
any right to think

37:50.930 --> 37:52.565
that I was sane...

37:55.535 --> 37:58.403
When all that mattered was...

37:58.436 --> 38:00.206
What I was...

38:00.239 --> 38:02.175
In the grand scheme of things...

38:04.844 --> 38:06.012
Which was nothing.

38:12.350 --> 38:13.853
He'd say that a lot.

38:21.326 --> 38:22.962
- Sam.
- What?

38:23.996 --> 38:27.033
Sam, you don't blame yourself
for that, right?

38:31.070 --> 38:33.139
- Sam.
- No. No.

38:36.609 --> 38:38.945
I'm sorry, guys, I'm just...

38:41.314 --> 38:42.480
I'm just tired.

38:44.116 --> 38:45.350
I'm gonna go to sleep.

38:52.158 --> 38:54.060
Fuck! I'm at two percent.

38:55.995 --> 38:57.563
Well...

38:57.597 --> 38:59.232
No more stories
for your followers.

39:00.766 --> 39:02.034
Whatever.

39:02.367 --> 39:06.105
He'd probably just be
messaging me stupid shit anyway.

39:07.940 --> 39:10.009
I have a car charger
for when we get back.

39:19.018 --> 39:21.419
<i>Terry, you find anything?</i>

39:23.956 --> 39:25.057
Nothing yet.

39:26.826 --> 39:28.194
<i>Jake knows these woods.</i>

39:28.227 --> 39:30.395
<i>If he's injured or something,
he's tough.</i>

39:33.398 --> 39:34.634
Yeah, I know.

39:34.667 --> 39:36.102
I got a call about
a couple of girls

39:36.135 --> 39:37.803
who might have had
a hunting accident.

39:38.070 --> 39:39.739
I'm looking for them, too.

39:41.207 --> 39:42.808
<i>Hunting accident?</i>

39:43.242 --> 39:44.786
They might have
stumbled across a hunter,

39:44.810 --> 39:46.579
I don't really know, but...

39:46.612 --> 39:47.923
They sounded pretty shook up
on the phone,

39:47.947 --> 39:49.715
so I told 'em I'd check it out.

39:51.483 --> 39:53.518
<i>Radio back if you see anything.</i>

39:54.787 --> 39:56.022
Roger.

40:16.909 --> 40:18.010
Jake!

40:19.477 --> 40:20.646
Jake!

40:25.450 --> 40:26.819
Jake, you out there?

40:32.391 --> 40:34.492
Cheryl, I found his helmet.

40:34.526 --> 40:36.461
- <i>His helmet?</i>
- Yeah, he's not here.

40:37.363 --> 40:38.463
<i>Where are you?</i>

40:39.065 --> 40:40.866
I'm about two clicks off
Bennet trail.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.868
I'm gonna keep searching
but call the county,

40:42.902 --> 40:44.770
tell 'em to send
two more trucks.

40:44.804 --> 40:45.938
<i>You got it.</i>

40:47.873 --> 40:49.108
Jake!

42:26.272 --> 42:27.440
Oh, fuck.

42:28.741 --> 42:30.109
They left the light on.

44:53.553 --> 44:55.521
Well, well, well...

44:57.189 --> 44:59.758
If it isn't the little piggy
with the house made of straw.

45:03.362 --> 45:05.599
I'm the big bad wolf that's
gonna blow your house down.

45:12.037 --> 45:13.405
Oh, come on.

45:14.406 --> 45:16.075
If you can't laugh...

45:17.677 --> 45:18.978
What's the point?

45:34.026 --> 45:35.928
Look into the camera and smile.

45:36.663 --> 45:38.998
You're being broadcast live.

45:39.031 --> 45:42.401
To all your loyal,
loving followers.

45:47.273 --> 45:48.953
What do you think
I should do to her, boys?

45:53.647 --> 45:56.949
Ah. I'm loving the interactions.

46:01.186 --> 46:03.556
Oh, this one seems to be
a little grim, even for me.

46:07.059 --> 46:09.529
Slitting her throat seems to be
the most popular idea.

46:14.166 --> 46:15.234
What?

46:15.968 --> 46:18.003
What?

46:22.374 --> 46:24.343
<i>No.</i>

46:26.111 --> 46:27.681
We're gonna draw this out.

46:34.887 --> 46:36.422
You know...

46:36.455 --> 46:37.823
You're pretty popular.

46:42.861 --> 46:44.063
You know what's funny?

46:45.732 --> 46:48.400
If you and I met in real life...

46:49.935 --> 46:51.003
You'd ignore me.

46:54.541 --> 46:56.075
Maybe you wouldn't ignore me.

46:56.776 --> 46:57.876
Maybe you'd smile.

46:58.977 --> 47:00.379
Maybe we'd even be friends.

47:02.981 --> 47:05.317
But we wouldn't really
be friends.

47:06.985 --> 47:08.387
You'd just be using me.

47:10.022 --> 47:12.491
Stringing me along.

47:13.727 --> 47:16.195
Always there as a shoulder
for you to cry on.

47:18.497 --> 47:20.065
I would always be there for you.

47:23.536 --> 47:25.337
Would someone like you
ever be there for me?

47:25.705 --> 47:27.741
Would someone like you
ever give me attention?

47:32.311 --> 47:35.682
Now, I've got your
strict attention.

47:36.148 --> 47:37.383
Now...

47:38.618 --> 47:39.885
I'm in control.

47:41.153 --> 47:45.491
Now, you can't infect my brain
with your body.

47:48.026 --> 47:50.062
And manipulate me...

47:50.597 --> 47:52.565
Into bending to your will.

48:10.182 --> 48:11.283
Riley?

48:18.357 --> 48:19.425
Riley?

48:25.865 --> 48:27.065
Riley?

48:30.436 --> 48:31.571
Riley?

48:33.907 --> 48:35.073
Heather, wake up.

48:35.107 --> 48:36.843
- What?
- Riley's gone.

48:37.009 --> 48:38.377
What?

48:38.812 --> 48:40.212
Riley is gone.

48:40.946 --> 48:43.550
- Riley! Riley?
- Fuck. I'm at one percent.

48:44.249 --> 48:45.317
Riley!

48:48.187 --> 48:50.022
She wouldn't just leave us.

48:50.989 --> 48:52.991
- Riley!
- Riley!

49:05.971 --> 49:07.272
What the fuck?

49:09.709 --> 49:11.109
What the fuck is that?

49:16.950 --> 49:18.116
It's a trail.

49:19.886 --> 49:21.086
Riley!

49:21.220 --> 49:22.521
Riley!

49:23.188 --> 49:25.190
- Riley!
- Riley!

49:25.991 --> 49:28.060
Are you okay?

49:29.261 --> 49:30.964
Okay, I'm gonna get
your inhaler.

49:41.774 --> 49:42.942
It's not here!

49:49.248 --> 49:50.550
I couldn't find it.

49:56.789 --> 49:58.090
Oh, my god.

49:58.658 --> 50:00.693
Oh, my god. Riley!

50:00.994 --> 50:02.929
- What? What?
- He has her.

50:03.395 --> 50:05.865
Heather, we don't know
what he wants.

50:05.899 --> 50:07.700
- Riley, we're coming!
- Heather!

50:15.975 --> 50:18.277
- Sam!
- I'm here.

50:18.912 --> 50:20.145
Sam!

50:21.981 --> 50:24.182
Oh, my god. Sam, get it off.

50:25.785 --> 50:27.687
- I can't.
- Sam, it hurts. Get it off.

50:28.220 --> 50:29.689
Calm.

50:29.856 --> 50:31.256
What are we gonna do? It hurts.

50:45.370 --> 50:46.906
What are we gonna do?

50:48.473 --> 50:50.175
Oh, my god.

50:51.310 --> 50:53.613
- I don't know if I can move.
- You've got to.

50:55.314 --> 50:57.316
Ready? One, two...
Don't put your weight on it.

50:57.349 --> 50:59.052
Don't put your weight on it.

50:59.451 --> 51:01.219
- I can't move any further.
- I got you.

51:04.289 --> 51:05.925
Put your weight on me.

51:06.525 --> 51:08.126
Oh, my god, I can't go.

51:10.262 --> 51:12.197
- Sam, I can't go any further.
- I know.

51:12.699 --> 51:14.634
- Here.
- I can't.

51:15.702 --> 51:17.269
Oh, my god.

51:17.302 --> 51:20.439
Okay, calm. Breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.

51:23.610 --> 51:26.111
- Okay, I have to go find Riley.
- No, don't leave me.

51:26.144 --> 51:29.181
Okay, okay.
I'm coming back for you, okay?

51:30.349 --> 51:32.051
We are going to
come back for you.

51:32.885 --> 51:34.252
Okay? Okay.

51:34.486 --> 51:37.023
Just try and stay calm. Okay?

53:21.594 --> 53:23.129
Riley. Riley.

53:23.162 --> 53:24.997
Hey, hey. No, hey, hey. It's me.

53:25.031 --> 53:27.100
It's me. It's me.
Okay, okay, okay.

53:27.700 --> 53:30.402
Sam. Sam. He's recording us.

53:41.446 --> 53:43.616
Help! Help!

53:45.517 --> 53:47.385
Get the fuck away from her!

53:47.653 --> 53:49.055
Sam!

53:49.321 --> 53:50.990
Help! Help!

53:51.023 --> 53:52.825
Somebody fucking help us!

53:53.458 --> 53:56.361
You motherfucker!
Get the fuck away from her!

53:56.394 --> 53:58.698
- I'm gonna kill your friend.
- Sam! Sam!

53:59.031 --> 54:02.101
- The blonde one, too.
- Fuck! Get the fuck away from her!

54:03.903 --> 54:05.303
Sam!

54:07.640 --> 54:09.508
You motherfucker!

54:09.542 --> 54:11.811
Sam! Sam!

54:11.844 --> 54:13.813
Are you okay?

54:27.660 --> 54:29.128
Sam!

55:00.827 --> 55:02.195
Okay.

55:08.568 --> 55:10.502
Sam! Sam.

55:11.436 --> 55:14.173
Oh, my god. Sam, what happened?

55:15.608 --> 55:16.943
Where's Heather?

55:17.743 --> 55:20.313
She, uh...
She got caught in a trap.

55:20.345 --> 55:22.815
She's... she's alive,
but she's hurt.

55:22.849 --> 55:24.516
Oh, my god.

55:25.117 --> 55:27.019
- Is he dead?
- I think so.

55:30.857 --> 55:33.092
Okay. Okay.

55:36.929 --> 55:38.698
I need you to
cut that out of me.

55:40.432 --> 55:41.934
Jesus Christ.

55:50.442 --> 55:52.011
What are you doing?

56:13.232 --> 56:15.433
I can't go any further.

56:15.968 --> 56:18.170
- I can't go any further.
- Okay, okay, okay.

56:20.606 --> 56:22.407
Okay, okay.

56:25.011 --> 56:27.046
Oh, my god, it hurts so much.

56:27.146 --> 56:28.648
Okay.

56:31.017 --> 56:33.719
- Oh, my god.
- Okay. Easy.

56:33.853 --> 56:35.453
Oh, my god.

56:35.487 --> 56:37.123
- I'm just cutting it open.
- Okay, okay.

56:37.156 --> 56:40.259
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

56:40.293 --> 56:41.894
Okay, okay.

56:55.408 --> 56:57.043
We need to get you to
the hospital.

56:58.510 --> 57:00.146
Who's doing this to us?

57:00.179 --> 57:02.114
Some fucking psychopath.

57:02.148 --> 57:04.350
He was filming it
and he put it all online.

57:04.550 --> 57:06.719
- What?
- Yeah.

57:06.953 --> 57:08.621
Is that what
the fuckin' laptop was for?

57:08.654 --> 57:09.989
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57:10.022 --> 57:11.924
I think he's been watching us
for a while.

57:13.292 --> 57:15.828
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, I think so.

57:15.861 --> 57:18.064
Sam shoved an arrow
through his stomach.

57:21.267 --> 57:22.935
Sam, is your leg okay?

57:22.969 --> 57:24.469
It's fine.

57:29.909 --> 57:32.311
That's a truck. Look, a truck.

57:36.749 --> 57:38.918
Hey! Hey!

57:40.152 --> 57:42.021
Help! Help!

57:42.288 --> 57:43.865
- You have to help us.
- What happened? What happened?

57:43.889 --> 57:46.659
There's a guy after us.
He's been shooting arrows at us.

57:46.692 --> 57:48.861
- What?
- Please. Help.

57:49.562 --> 57:51.998
Cheryl, it's Terry.
I'm gonna need an airlift.

57:52.031 --> 57:53.566
<i>What's the situation?</i>

57:53.866 --> 57:57.236
I got a female hiker, early 20s,
with a possible compound fracture.

57:57.269 --> 57:59.338
<i>I'll send search and rescue
your way.</i>

57:59.905 --> 58:02.675
Roger. All right, just breathe.
What happened?

58:03.242 --> 58:04.744
Some kind of bear trap.

58:04.777 --> 58:06.254
Jesus Christ.
All right, you know what?

58:06.278 --> 58:07.723
This is gonna be easier
if I take you in the truck.

58:07.747 --> 58:09.348
Okay. Come on.

58:27.933 --> 58:29.301
Get back here!

58:32.138 --> 58:33.906
You think anyone's
coming to save you?

58:37.343 --> 58:38.677
Nobody's coming.

58:51.657 --> 58:52.992
Oh, my god!

59:02.902 --> 59:04.136
I'm sorry.

59:17.883 --> 59:19.085
Oh, my god.
