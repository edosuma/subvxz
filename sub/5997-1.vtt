"Let's make a bet, between you
and me, for the soul of a man."

down on Job, a devout man, religious,

15:15.000 --> 15:16.911
and the Devil said,
"I can change his mind

15:17.000 --> 15:18.399
"and make him
curse your name."

15:18.520 --> 15:21.319

and you will only fail."

15:21.800 --> 15:23.598
So the Devil begins.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.713
He kills Job's herds
and takes his fields.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.918
He plagues him with boils
and throws him on the ash heap.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.231

remains unchanged.

an accomplice in a getaway car?

33:53.960 --> 33:55.155
Your dad called.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.595
You know him.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.352
He likes to talk things
through before he goes to bed.

about this seminar.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.635
You remember, hon. It's next
weekend. Constance is taking me.

Lifespring. Everybody's
doing it. Oh, yeah.

35:19.120 --> 35:22.670
I really think this course is gonna
help me actualize, you know, fully.

you know, as a person.

35:38.520 --> 35:39.840

Yeah.

35:41.840 --> 35:48.075
Well, Bud asked again if I was interested
in maybe taking over the butcher shop.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.595
Mmm.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.560
Said he's thinking
of retiring end of the year.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.950
Just had the end
of the year, huh?

35:55.040 --> 35:57.395
Yeah, I guess
he means this year,

35:58.440 --> 36:00.192
but wouldn't that
be great?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.070

36:03.160 --> 36:05.515
And maybe you take
over the salon one day,

whole litter of kids by then.

in 1931 by Dieter Gerhardt.

Now deceased, and taken
over in 1950 by his son, Otto.

their shot at the throne.
