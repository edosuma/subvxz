of candidates we have here,

08:59.919 --> 09:03.501
she's probably the only one
that already worships the devil.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.321
She's hardly
a challenge, Stefan.

09:05.415 --> 09:06.915
You want a challenge, huh?

09:06.948 --> 09:08.349
Yeah. Hmm.

09:10.157 --> 09:11.764
Let's go with that woman,
right there.

09:11.789 --> 09:14.077
The old woman? Spilling
stuff everywhere?

09:14.148 --> 09:16.507
- What are we doing, mercy killings?
- No.

09:16.609 --> 09:18.429
The doctor helping her.

09:23.976 --> 09:26.078
(Clinking)

09:32.799 --> 09:36.260
Well, how do you know she's
a doctor and not some orderly?

09:36.369 --> 09:38.322
Manicured nails...
Means she doesn't

09:38.369 --> 09:40.729
work with her hands. Medical
pager means she's on call.

09:40.799 --> 09:42.807
Only in her 20s
and already a doctor?

09:42.877 --> 09:44.197
Huh. Must have graduated early.

09:44.229 --> 09:46.369
Really thrown herself
into her work.

09:46.463 --> 09:48.854
- Why do you think that is, Damon?
- I don't know, Stefan.

09:48.947 --> 09:51.088
Maybe she had a brother that
bored the crap out of her?

09:51.112 --> 09:54.057
Or maybe, she's driven
by something dark.

09:54.299 --> 09:56.479
Some sort of pain in her past.

09:56.504 --> 09:58.760
Not everybody's a big ball
of angst like you.

09:58.846 --> 10:01.080
Maybe she's driven
by something good.

10:01.113 --> 10:04.065
Those sound like some bettin'
words to me, Damon. Oh, really?

10:04.182 --> 10:06.213
Sounds like
some winnin' words to me.

10:06.238 --> 10:07.329
Well...

10:07.354 --> 10:09.471
Only one way to find out, right?

10:09.521 --> 10:12.135
(Damon grunts)

10:13.080 --> 10:14.883
- Shh.
- (Groans)

10:15.190 --> 10:17.784
Oh, my God.
Is there a doctor here?

10:22.993 --> 10:24.361
(Scraping)

10:24.425 --> 10:26.194
(Damon groans)

10:27.517 --> 10:29.352
Vervain? Come on, man.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.386
Don't you trust me
to play along with your attempt

10:31.410 --> 10:33.152
to corrupt the good doctor?

10:33.183 --> 10:34.555
Well, I got to sell
your hospital stay

10:34.579 --> 10:36.269
with a little bit of
actual weakness, right?

10:36.293 --> 10:37.980
I did some Internet stalking.

10:38.066 --> 10:40.519
So, it turns out that
Tara's mom and dad

10:40.552 --> 10:42.933
were both killed
in a car accident ten years ago.

10:43.022 --> 10:44.160
It was a hit-and-run.

10:44.222 --> 10:45.941
They never found the driver.

10:46.090 --> 10:48.308
I told you she was
driven by something dark.

10:48.427 --> 10:51.430
All I've heard is sad, Stefan.

10:51.566 --> 10:53.668
I haven't heard dark.

10:53.855 --> 10:56.683
Maybe your spidey-sense
is wrong about her, pal.

10:56.746 --> 10:59.199
Oh, my spidey-sense
is doing just fine, thank you.

10:59.338 --> 11:00.605
Listen to this.

11:00.683 --> 11:02.754
Her parents were both
organ donors

11:02.808 --> 11:05.558
and their untimely passing
saved other people's lives.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.068
That's why Tara
went into medicine.

11:07.109 --> 11:08.667
- Really?
- She even volunteers her time

11:08.691 --> 11:10.597
at an organ-transplant
support group.

11:10.722 --> 11:12.818
That's a little morbid,
if you ask me.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.090
Although actually, it's, uh...

11:18.332 --> 11:20.136
It's perfect.

11:22.879 --> 11:24.519
I can't believe Ric agreed
to let her go.

11:24.590 --> 11:25.643
And you guys haven't seen her

11:25.667 --> 11:27.004
- since Christmas?
- Matt: No.

11:27.069 --> 11:28.397
Yeah, I was out of town.

11:28.452 --> 11:30.163
That's his specialty.

11:30.328 --> 11:32.330
Dorian: Here's another artifact
that could help.

11:32.425 --> 11:35.202
Mr. skeleton Maxwell
was a metalsmith, Circa 1790.

11:35.340 --> 11:36.952
In his journal,
he made sketches of something

11:36.976 --> 11:38.242
that he smithyed-up
before he died.

11:38.266 --> 11:39.882
Now, according
to Dalton St. John,

11:39.937 --> 11:40.967
the surviving Maxwells

11:41.014 --> 11:42.530
made a family heirloom out of it.

11:44.209 --> 11:46.054
That look familiar?

11:46.758 --> 11:48.210
No, not really.

11:48.288 --> 11:50.127
But it could have been
inside the family storage box

11:50.151 --> 11:51.889
that Damon came looking for.

11:52.491 --> 11:53.905
Yeah. Meanwhile,

11:53.944 --> 11:54.911
the rest of Dalton's writings

11:54.936 --> 11:56.350
from 1883 were about seline.

11:56.375 --> 11:57.349
"What seline wants."

11:57.374 --> 11:59.038
He lists
precise measurements from neck,

11:59.079 --> 12:01.048
shoulder, lip, tongue...

12:01.116 --> 12:02.422
Yeah, I'd say he was
obsessed with her.

12:02.446 --> 12:04.304
He even measured her
for a crown.

12:04.970 --> 12:06.218
Wait, hang on.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.034
Let me see that list.

12:10.796 --> 12:13.398
These are all parts of a bell.

12:13.663 --> 12:15.347
Neck, shoulder, lip, crown...

12:15.380 --> 12:16.648
They're metalworking terms.

12:16.681 --> 12:18.350
The measurements make sense.

12:18.383 --> 12:19.835
- Dorian: Really?
- Yeah.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.229
The Maxwells used to be
in the business

12:21.253 --> 12:22.521
of making church bells.

12:22.554 --> 12:23.989
That's how our family metalworks

12:24.023 --> 12:25.224
started, back in the day.

12:25.264 --> 12:26.593
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

12:26.643 --> 12:28.764
You got a really low bar
for "cool."

12:38.762 --> 12:41.030
Well, no diagnosis yet.

12:41.307 --> 12:44.171
His blood work came back
completely normal.

12:45.397 --> 12:46.522
Well, I guess I always knew

12:46.591 --> 12:48.233
something like this
would happen.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.914
Why do you say that?

12:49.960 --> 12:51.383
Stefan: It's just Karma.

12:51.416 --> 12:54.210
He's made a lot of
dark choices in his life.

12:54.701 --> 12:57.131
Hurt a lot of people
along the way.

12:57.530 --> 12:59.632
I don't think you should be
telling me this.

12:59.694 --> 13:00.890
You know, I can't
help but think that

13:00.914 --> 13:02.819
maybe this is all
happening for a reason.

13:02.873 --> 13:04.702
I was on an organ donor
web site today,

13:04.756 --> 13:06.858
and I saw a list of
all these people... these really

13:06.883 --> 13:09.520
deserving people... just waiting
in line for a transplant.

13:09.592 --> 13:11.911
Mm. And your brother
is an organ donor.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.950
Yes, I saw that
on his intake form.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.008
Look, it doesn't do any good
to speculate.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.042
Why not?

13:17.122 --> 13:18.575
I mean, I-I saw this one girl,

13:18.677 --> 13:20.279
she's all the way
at the top of the list.

13:20.312 --> 13:21.413
Her name is kassie Fowler.

13:21.446 --> 13:22.414
Yeah, I know her.

13:22.447 --> 13:23.715
She's a patient of mine.

13:23.748 --> 13:25.318
She's a really good kid.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.279
Her profile says she wants to
go to developing countries

13:27.303 --> 13:30.622
and-and build Wells
and get clean water.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.036
- Mm.
- It's not her fault

13:32.061 --> 13:33.974
that her kidneys are
failing. So, what,

13:34.037 --> 13:36.380
Damon gets to waste his life

13:36.646 --> 13:38.224
and she's not able to live hers?

13:38.291 --> 13:40.919
I can't think like that, sadly.

13:41.044 --> 13:44.164
As a doctor, every life has to
be as important as the next.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.740
Hmm.

13:46.582 --> 13:49.318
Even after everything
that he's done?

13:49.374 --> 13:51.583
Well, whatever you feel
about your brother's past...

13:51.643 --> 13:54.622
What if I told you that
he caused your parents' death?

13:55.231 --> 13:56.505
What?

13:58.005 --> 14:01.053
My parents were killed
by a drunk driver.

14:01.086 --> 14:02.454
Why would you say that?

14:02.487 --> 14:03.588
Because you...

14:03.622 --> 14:05.057
Need an opportunity.

14:05.090 --> 14:06.491
Here's what you believe.

14:06.525 --> 14:09.685
Damon is a drunk driver.

14:09.800 --> 14:13.193
Damon is the one
who killed your parents.

14:18.803 --> 14:20.239
(Door opening)

14:24.392 --> 14:26.302
Stack the deck, why don't you?

14:26.511 --> 14:28.997
Cade never said
I couldn't take a shortcut.

14:29.076 --> 14:31.249
I told you
she'd be a challenge. Hmm.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.617
What are you so pleased about?

14:32.684 --> 14:34.046
You're supposed to be on task.

14:34.253 --> 14:35.354
All I'm saying is maybe

14:35.413 --> 14:37.222
some people can't be corrupted.

14:37.305 --> 14:39.835
Maybe she's just plain good.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.783
Mm. No one is just plain good.

14:43.471 --> 14:44.739
You'll see.

14:45.398 --> 14:47.327
Hey, what are you doing?

14:47.452 --> 14:49.534
Oh, just upping
your vervain intake.

14:49.568 --> 14:50.601
What? No.

14:50.648 --> 14:52.249
I need to create
a medical emergency

14:52.278 --> 14:54.114
in order for the rest
of the game to play out.

14:54.171 --> 14:56.460
Can you stop cheating
for just one second?

14:56.485 --> 14:57.427
Damon,

14:57.452 --> 14:59.554
I work for the devil.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.273
I don't have to play fair.

15:02.447 --> 15:04.383
Mmm...
(Grumbling)

15:04.439 --> 15:07.442
(Monitor beeping rapidly)

15:08.236 --> 15:10.095
Who can tell me
when Mystic Falls

15:10.142 --> 15:11.916
officially became a town?

15:13.431 --> 15:14.713
Caroline?

15:14.815 --> 15:16.270
Do you remember anything
you learned

15:16.295 --> 15:17.538
in this incredibly
ugly building,

15:17.562 --> 15:18.830
all those years ago?

15:18.863 --> 15:21.222
Mystic Falls was founded in 1860

15:21.292 --> 15:22.933
when a lockwood, a Forbes,

15:23.013 --> 15:25.175
a fell, a Gilbert
and a Salvatore

15:25.281 --> 15:27.183
gathered to sign
the township charter.

15:27.306 --> 15:29.425
Name-dropper. And... wrong.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.792
- (Students laughing)
- Those are the founding families.

15:31.878 --> 15:33.854
Your ancestors took credit, yes.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.253
But long before they
picked up Turkey feathers

15:36.278 --> 15:37.949
to write that silly charter,

15:37.988 --> 15:39.551
there were other people here.

15:39.584 --> 15:41.586
A group of men and women
who were different.

15:41.620 --> 15:43.574
Misunderstood. Ultimately,

15:43.644 --> 15:45.894
they burned to death
because of who they were.

15:45.964 --> 15:47.435
Are you talking about
the hundred witches

15:47.459 --> 15:48.827
who were burned
at the stake here?

15:48.860 --> 15:51.201
1790.
(Exhales)

15:51.226 --> 15:53.232
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

15:53.295 --> 15:55.864
It was the most delicious smell.

15:56.311 --> 15:58.437
The smoke lasted for hours.
(Chuckles)

15:58.470 --> 16:00.705
How could you know that?

16:01.772 --> 16:03.873
Who wants to go on a field trip?

16:04.014 --> 16:05.310
Me, too.

16:05.469 --> 16:07.203
The bus is outside.

16:09.334 --> 16:10.951
And Miss Forbes,

16:11.154 --> 16:13.623
you can sit with me.

16:14.091 --> 16:15.977
I don't think so.

16:19.116 --> 16:20.647
Oh, look at that,

16:20.709 --> 16:23.116
I've perfected my
long-distance technique.

16:23.159 --> 16:24.289
Your blood isn't gonna save him,

16:24.313 --> 16:26.365
I've told his mind to shut down.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.679
(Sighs)

16:28.835 --> 16:30.602
If anyone dies here, your little

16:30.635 --> 16:32.337
"apple for the teacher" act
gets blown.

16:32.371 --> 16:33.994
It might be worth it.

16:34.226 --> 16:36.353
But for now, get up.

16:42.447 --> 16:45.290
Consider that a warning.

16:45.548 --> 16:47.786
Any deaths today
will be your fault,

16:47.819 --> 16:49.788
and will go on your
scorecard for hell.

16:54.732 --> 16:56.334
Coming?

17:02.502 --> 17:05.673
Sybil: This place has gone
downhill since 1790.

17:05.767 --> 17:08.673
Caroline: I always forget you're so much
older than you look. (Sybil chuckles)

17:08.696 --> 17:10.212
Talk to me in a
couple thousand years,

17:10.243 --> 17:11.796
we'll see how you're holding up.

17:11.882 --> 17:13.811
Do I want to know why
your last visit to this field

17:13.836 --> 17:15.006
was around the same time

17:15.063 --> 17:16.412
a hundred witches
burned to death?

17:16.571 --> 17:17.998
Hi. I had been traveling the region

17:18.049 --> 17:21.170
with my sister, looking for
tasty souls to feed to Cade,

17:21.279 --> 17:22.678
and the witches took exception.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.755
Are you saying it's your fault
the witches were burned

17:24.779 --> 17:26.553
- at the stake?
- Clearly, you don't know

17:26.615 --> 17:29.545
the full story. How the hundred
witches really died.

17:29.618 --> 17:31.825
(Sighs) Why do I feel like
you're about to break into song?

17:31.849 --> 17:33.289
Don't tempt me.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.990
The witches gave
some magical help

17:35.023 --> 17:38.142
to a local metalsmith who was
making a church bell for them.

17:38.289 --> 17:40.219
This bell had a special purpose.

17:40.273 --> 17:43.226
But what no one realized was
that seline and I had befriended

17:43.282 --> 17:45.301
this metalsmith.
(Chuckles softly)

17:45.334 --> 17:47.202
We threw a little
wrinkle into his plan.

17:52.608 --> 17:54.491
Wait... what are they doing?

17:54.983 --> 17:57.694
Call it extra credit.

17:58.474 --> 18:00.491
I found some descriptions
of an antique church bell

18:00.577 --> 18:01.484
in your family estate records.

18:01.517 --> 18:03.719
Wait, we have an estate?

18:03.865 --> 18:06.693
Oh, we did. Most of it was sold
to the town of Mystic Falls,

18:06.740 --> 18:08.092
to try to pay off
our family debt.

18:08.169 --> 18:09.365
Grandma, she...

18:09.451 --> 18:10.726
She liked the ponies.

18:10.759 --> 18:12.076
One more thing to be proud of.

18:12.232 --> 18:13.996
Dorian: Anyway,
according to this,

18:14.029 --> 18:15.598
the bell measurements
are an exact match

18:15.631 --> 18:17.100
to what Dalton St.
John wrote about.

18:17.186 --> 18:19.537
That's what seline
was looking for in 1883.

18:19.615 --> 18:21.412
Why would she care
about our church bell?

18:21.537 --> 18:22.738
Sybil: Peter Maxwell

18:22.771 --> 18:25.012
was the last one to have his
hands on that witches' bell.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.343
Right up until
he threw it off a bridge,

18:27.376 --> 18:28.748
some 20-odd years ago.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.879
I looked into his mind
and I saw the whole thing.

18:30.975 --> 18:33.482
Some kind of a parade,
a bell hanging on a float.

18:33.516 --> 18:35.050
The founder's day parade.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.052
They ring the charter
bell every year.

18:37.085 --> 18:38.487
It's a replica.

18:38.521 --> 18:40.241
The real one went over something

18:40.288 --> 18:42.533
called wickery bridge in 1992.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.048
Anyway, I have spent

18:44.073 --> 18:45.361
the last three weeks

18:45.394 --> 18:46.546
sending people into that river

18:46.570 --> 18:47.938
to look for that bell,

18:48.009 --> 18:49.798
and they haven't found
a thing... but I know

18:49.832 --> 18:53.013
it still exists,
because it can't be destroyed.

18:53.302 --> 18:54.810
That's not ominous.

18:54.944 --> 18:56.044
Blame the witches.

18:56.124 --> 18:58.393
No wonder people found them
so annoying.

18:59.316 --> 19:01.185
Now, please.

19:09.576 --> 19:10.866
No.

19:14.102 --> 19:16.204
(Sighs, squeals happily)

19:16.251 --> 19:17.759
No, you can't be serious.

19:17.865 --> 19:22.571
Use the whole can, children.
Thoroughness is important.

19:25.519 --> 19:26.997
Violet, stop.

19:27.077 --> 19:28.678
Violet!

19:30.839 --> 19:33.372
- No, everybody stop!
- Uh, hello?

19:33.427 --> 19:34.433
They're sirened. Oh,

19:34.458 --> 19:37.183
you brought the lighter.
Of course you did. Good girl.

19:39.254 --> 19:40.441
Ooh.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.423
- Let them go.
- Any other useless demands?

19:47.590 --> 19:50.826
I'm not gonna release them
until you bring me that bell.

19:50.859 --> 19:52.461
What do you even want
this bell for?

19:52.495 --> 19:53.962
I'm sentimental. I want it.

19:53.996 --> 19:55.464
And I need your help to find it.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.832
Or everyone dies, is that it?

19:56.865 --> 19:58.567
(Sighs)
Well, you can't save them all.

19:58.601 --> 20:00.952
I mean, torches,
lighter fluid... poof.

20:00.977 --> 20:03.403
Yeah, I know how fire works.

20:03.739 --> 20:05.265
(Sighs)

20:05.429 --> 20:07.843
How exactly am I supposed
to find this bell anyway?

20:07.890 --> 20:10.593
I didn't expect
it would be easy.

20:11.569 --> 20:14.783
That's why I've given you
an incentive. Hmm?

20:22.249 --> 20:24.460
His blood pressure's
bottoming out.

20:24.843 --> 20:26.495
He barely has a heartbeat.

20:26.733 --> 20:28.671
(Weakly): Tara,
listen to me.

20:28.796 --> 20:31.085
- Please don't talk.
- Please.

20:31.199 --> 20:32.601
Come closer.

20:32.741 --> 20:34.503
Please.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.505
Look at me.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.474
I was never...

20:38.710 --> 20:40.882
A drunk driver.

20:43.911 --> 20:45.379
Oh.

20:46.632 --> 20:48.343
Sorry, Damon.

20:49.518 --> 20:51.538
You're too weak
to convince her otherwise.

20:51.671 --> 20:53.421
Mm.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.912
Tara.

20:56.077 --> 20:58.452
Show him I'm right about you.

20:58.671 --> 21:01.069
Give me a chance
to redeem myself.

21:01.196 --> 21:04.069
No matter what you do,
her parents will still be gone.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.460
Your mistakes can
never be undone.

21:06.546 --> 21:08.843
My life is worth something.

21:09.163 --> 21:10.639
So is your death.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.424
Think about
how much good you would do

21:12.480 --> 21:14.963
for the people who
actually deserve to live.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.645
Uh...

21:16.679 --> 21:18.814
(Mutters indistinctly)

21:23.509 --> 21:25.845
(Monitor beeps rapidly)

21:26.096 --> 21:27.892
I-I think you
shouldn't be in here.

21:27.955 --> 21:30.127
His heart's already failing.

21:31.275 --> 21:33.650
Maybe we should
just wait it out.

21:34.017 --> 21:36.565
I took an oath to help people.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.281
I understand, I do.

21:38.414 --> 21:40.320
But here's what I can't
stop thinking about.

21:40.438 --> 21:41.804
You fix Damon's heart,

21:41.837 --> 21:43.806
you get him back
up on his feet again.

21:44.008 --> 21:45.586
Then he goes back to drinking.

21:45.645 --> 21:47.688
Then one night
he gets behind the wheel,

21:47.844 --> 21:49.978
causes another accident.

21:50.336 --> 21:52.222
Someone else's parents die.

21:52.425 --> 21:55.191
Or maybe this time
it's a couple of kids.

21:55.292 --> 21:57.085
We can't predict the future.

21:57.119 --> 22:00.488
I know, but we can
judge the past.

22:00.964 --> 22:03.826
How many times does Damon have
to show us who he really is

22:03.859 --> 22:06.222
before we actually believe him?

22:06.456 --> 22:08.621
I understand your
struggle, I really do.

22:08.714 --> 22:11.128
Trying to be perfect
for everyone

22:11.300 --> 22:13.519
when all you want to do is
make a choice for yourself.

22:13.730 --> 22:15.237
This is not about me.

22:15.278 --> 22:18.472
Yes, it is, because
you are in charge.

22:19.299 --> 22:20.976
So follow your instincts,

22:21.721 --> 22:24.456
and do what you think is right.

22:25.489 --> 22:27.152
(Damon mutters indistinctly)

22:33.622 --> 22:35.758
I-I think you should leave.

22:38.416 --> 22:40.451
Now.

22:50.114 --> 22:52.153
Tara...

22:52.313 --> 22:54.182
I'm sorry.

22:55.824 --> 22:57.145
Did you hear me?

22:59.458 --> 23:01.528
I...

23:01.731 --> 23:03.051
Tara...

23:03.270 --> 23:06.895
It's... I...

23:07.055 --> 23:09.723
I'm sorry for what I did.

23:14.963 --> 23:17.880
I appreciate you saying that...

23:18.895 --> 23:20.880
But it's just not enough.

23:21.069 --> 23:23.305
Uh... no...

23:23.583 --> 23:25.908
Damon: I wish I could
go back and change it,

23:25.941 --> 23:27.419
but I can't.

23:27.599 --> 23:31.505
I'm so sorry
for all that I've done.

23:31.965 --> 23:33.916
No, listen to me.

23:34.044 --> 23:36.997
Killing me won't
change the past.

23:37.219 --> 23:40.823
No, but it'll change
your future.

23:44.811 --> 23:46.946
Oh...

23:48.858 --> 23:51.022
(Weakly): No.

23:51.819 --> 23:53.869
Don't do it, Tara.

That figures.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.677
Matt, when's the last time you saw
your dad?

25:16.701 --> 25:17.972
I'm with him right now.

25:17.997 --> 25:19.575
You sound stressed. You okay?

25:19.645 --> 25:22.086
I'm fine. I just need
to get Sybil the antique bell

25:22.141 --> 25:23.632
that your dad threw off
Wickery Bridge.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.945
Wait, slow down, you lost me
after "I'm fine."

25:26.008 --> 25:27.969
(Sighs) When your dad lived
in Mystic Falls,

25:28.008 --> 25:29.711
he took our charter bell
to Wickery Bridge,

25:29.758 --> 25:31.914
and then threw it
off the railing.

25:31.985 --> 25:33.360
And now Sybil wants it back.

25:33.385 --> 25:36.130
She says it's got
sentimental value, or something.

25:36.203 --> 25:38.385
- Wait, when was this?
- 1992,

25:38.418 --> 25:40.420
according to the head-dive
Sybil did on your dad.

25:40.454 --> 25:41.875
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Caroline: Why?

25:41.899 --> 25:43.320
Wickery Bridge is where
Elena's parents

25:43.344 --> 25:44.424
drove the car off the road.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.227
When the sheriffs
dredged out the car,

25:46.313 --> 25:47.500
they found something else...

25:47.555 --> 25:49.016
The old charter bell.

25:49.070 --> 25:50.422
It was broken,
but they saved it.

25:50.492 --> 25:52.308
Well, let's hope they
didn't sell it on ebay.

25:52.332 --> 25:53.836
No, your mom had it in storage.

25:53.945 --> 25:55.618
I only know this because
I cleaned out her office

25:55.642 --> 25:56.536
after the funeral.

25:56.570 --> 25:58.040
All those boxes
you brought over to the house,

25:58.064 --> 26:00.899
- they're still in the garage.
- Take me there. Now.

26:01.175 --> 26:02.309
Caroline, don't do it.

26:02.342 --> 26:03.468
You need to get away from her.

26:03.492 --> 26:04.554
I don't have a choice, Matt.

26:04.578 --> 26:05.905
These kids are gonna
kill each other.

26:05.929 --> 26:07.164
What kids? Where are you?

26:07.314 --> 26:09.242
Matt, hey, if you try
to stop her

26:09.292 --> 26:11.261
from helping me,
I send a psychic command,

26:11.320 --> 26:12.805
and my students die anyway.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.046
If you come over to her house,

26:14.070 --> 26:15.180
my students will die.

26:15.205 --> 26:16.602
If I find out that anyone

26:16.627 --> 26:18.750
- is trying to interfere...
- Ugh! God, we get it.

26:18.775 --> 26:20.160
(Phone beeps)

26:20.194 --> 26:21.969
You really should
have been a teacher.

26:22.062 --> 26:24.564
Hmm. Maybe that'll be
my second career,

26:24.672 --> 26:26.610
after you get me that bell.

26:31.375 --> 26:33.610
Hey, maybe you should have
told the sheriff's department

26:33.649 --> 26:35.086
what's really going on.

26:35.209 --> 26:36.523
They know it's urgent.
They'll call as soon

26:36.547 --> 26:37.587
as they hear
from the bus company.

26:37.610 --> 26:38.635
Besides, we know
Sybil's field trip

26:38.659 --> 26:40.128
was headed near Mystic Falls.

26:40.153 --> 26:41.121
We're going
in the right direction.

26:41.146 --> 26:43.078
All because she wants a bell.

26:43.164 --> 26:45.508
I've never heard
of anything so insane.

26:45.664 --> 26:48.222
Says the guy who
threw it off the bridge.

26:48.586 --> 26:50.190
I mean, what were you
thinking, anyway?

26:50.224 --> 26:52.750
- I was thinking about the parade.
- What?

26:53.008 --> 26:54.656
The founders day parade.

26:54.794 --> 26:56.207
You know, the one where
they put the charter bell

26:56.231 --> 26:57.976
on a float,
and some rich guy rings it

26:58.000 --> 27:00.016
while two dumbasses stand
on either side of him

27:00.047 --> 27:01.977
wearing moldy
civil war uniforms?

27:02.048 --> 27:03.711
I was one of the dumbasses
in the parade.

27:03.770 --> 27:05.505
Well, at least
I was supposed to be.

27:05.539 --> 27:08.208
So you wanted to get
the parade cancelled?

27:08.492 --> 27:10.664
- Classy.
- No, Matt, it's not just that.

27:10.703 --> 27:13.380
Our family made that bell.
The Maxwell family.

27:13.413 --> 27:15.102
The very first family
with a skilled trade

27:15.149 --> 27:16.358
that brought people
to this area.

27:16.382 --> 27:17.851
It's because of us
that there was ever

27:17.875 --> 27:19.281
even a town at all.

27:20.641 --> 27:21.974
But the people who
took over the town,

27:21.998 --> 27:23.532
they had money, lots of it.

27:23.823 --> 27:25.422
They called themselves
the "founders,"

27:25.492 --> 27:26.765
they made themselves the elite.

27:26.820 --> 27:28.563
And they treated
the Maxwell family like...

27:28.664 --> 27:29.969
Like an embarrassment.

27:30.188 --> 27:33.133
And, eventually, we became one.

27:34.344 --> 27:36.320
That bell was a symbol

27:36.406 --> 27:38.711
of everything they took from us.

27:39.539 --> 27:42.809
So the bell met the river.

27:43.219 --> 27:45.945
And I got in my car
and I never looked back

27:46.016 --> 27:48.367
until now.

27:52.942 --> 27:54.516
(Cell phone chimes)

27:54.594 --> 27:55.703
Sheriff Department.

27:55.765 --> 27:57.750
They said only one bus
went out on a field trip today.

27:57.774 --> 27:59.578
There's a GPS link to that address.

27:59.633 --> 28:01.695
Here. Go, go!

28:10.884 --> 28:12.321
Hi.

28:12.548 --> 28:14.290
I just wanted to say good-bye.

28:14.384 --> 28:16.071
I know you tried
to help my brother.

28:16.176 --> 28:18.352
- Sorry for your loss.
- Oh, don't be.

28:18.493 --> 28:20.155
Joke's on you.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.032
Okay, I know
you must be in shock.

28:23.106 --> 28:24.340
What if I'm not?

28:24.584 --> 28:26.320
What if it was all a game,

28:26.477 --> 28:28.274
and I was just giving you
a morality test?

28:28.438 --> 28:30.399
That would be insane.

28:30.556 --> 28:32.454
And... cruel.

28:32.515 --> 28:34.790
Either way, my brother's still dead.

28:35.611 --> 28:36.845
Oh, God.

28:36.939 --> 28:39.551
But he died from
natural causes, right?

28:39.673 --> 28:40.953
You called me in after the fact,

28:40.985 --> 28:44.306
so nobody knows what
you did on your own.

28:44.595 --> 28:46.329
You wanted him dead.

28:47.540 --> 28:49.509
- You tricked me.
- No, no, no.

28:49.579 --> 28:51.445
I just wanted to see
what you would do

28:51.494 --> 28:53.415
if I gave you the opportunity.

28:53.587 --> 28:55.720
And you lived up
to your potential.

28:55.882 --> 28:58.290
Oh, Stefan...

28:58.712 --> 29:00.009
You're... dead.

29:00.079 --> 29:01.665
Technically, you're not wrong.

29:01.725 --> 29:04.087
Thought you'd be sleeping off
a vervain hangover, Damon.

29:04.189 --> 29:05.868
Oh, fortunately, I got
a little pick-me-up

29:05.892 --> 29:08.509
from an orderly that came
to get my body.

29:10.267 --> 29:12.423
Thanks for nothing, by the way.

29:12.720 --> 29:15.040
You were in on it?

29:15.470 --> 29:17.283
Be quiet.
Don't try to escape.

29:17.441 --> 29:18.658
You already failed the test.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.615
You really think Cade's
gonna want her, man?

29:21.658 --> 29:22.679
She's not even evil.

29:22.704 --> 29:23.829
She's done evil things.

29:23.902 --> 29:26.771
Maybe she deserves
a second chance.

29:28.515 --> 29:30.750
(Sighs)
You know, I gotta say,

29:31.210 --> 29:32.663
I'm disappointed.

29:32.698 --> 29:34.968
Well, that's your
resting state, Stefan, so what?

29:35.038 --> 29:37.554
Now, I can see why
you were confused.

29:44.096 --> 29:45.541
Missing something?

29:45.814 --> 29:47.501
I found this in your pocket.

29:47.752 --> 29:49.088
You've been carrying it around

29:49.135 --> 29:50.642
for weeks, haven't you?

29:50.775 --> 29:53.447
So what? It's a re-gift
from Caroline.

29:53.580 --> 29:55.542
- I forgot I even had it.
- You sure about that?

29:55.603 --> 29:57.317
Ever since we hit the road,
something's been off.

29:57.341 --> 29:59.330
- Yeah, my emotions.
- No, no, no.

29:59.413 --> 30:00.877
Your sense of fun.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.908
Why do you think
I picked Tara over here

30:03.002 --> 30:04.784
for our little game, hmm?

30:04.818 --> 30:06.553
She remind you of someone?

30:06.586 --> 30:08.103
Interest in medicine.

30:08.228 --> 30:10.064
Brown eyes, brown hair.

30:10.189 --> 30:11.971
Orphaned by tragedy.

30:12.236 --> 30:13.827
She reminds you of Elena.

30:13.971 --> 30:15.529
And so does this necklace.

30:15.705 --> 30:17.174
It triggers your conscience.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.420
It's holding you back, Damon.

30:18.473 --> 30:20.635
- No, it's not.
- Well...

30:22.150 --> 30:23.937
If that's true, then...

30:24.033 --> 30:26.213
I think she's ready
to meet the boss.

30:34.448 --> 30:36.557
Matt, I figured something out.

30:36.650 --> 30:38.549
- About the sirens?
- Dorian: No, not exactly.

30:38.611 --> 30:41.174
About their toys. I figured it
out from Dalton's measurements.

30:41.252 --> 30:42.856
The Maxwell heirloom
and the tuning fork,

30:42.881 --> 30:45.806
those things fit together
to make a clapper,

30:45.908 --> 30:47.549
the hammer that swings
inside a bell.

30:47.580 --> 30:48.986
So those three missing things,

30:49.057 --> 30:50.924
they're all a part of one bell.

30:51.025 --> 30:53.072
When properly assembled,
this bell becomes,

30:53.135 --> 30:56.642
like, a mystical,
witchified super-bell.

30:56.861 --> 30:58.892
I mean, it makes you wonder
what happens when you ring it.

30:58.916 --> 31:00.986
If the sound of the tuning fork
hurts the sirens,

31:01.127 --> 31:04.533
imagine that magnified
by a thousand.

31:04.721 --> 31:07.267
Oh, wow, that's cool, right?

31:07.439 --> 31:09.494
Matt? Matt, you there?

31:09.674 --> 31:11.351
Yeah, I gotta call you back.

31:13.385 --> 31:15.580
Hey...

31:16.205 --> 31:17.991
Hey, hey, listen. Look...

31:18.024 --> 31:19.627
You need to back away, okay?

31:19.705 --> 31:21.461
Hey. Hey!

31:21.548 --> 31:23.032
She's not gonna listen to you.

31:23.142 --> 31:24.680
None of them will.
Sybil's controlling them.

31:24.704 --> 31:26.766
Help me untie 'em, now.

31:35.517 --> 31:37.899
Not seeing anything bell-shaped.

31:38.048 --> 31:39.094
Looks like you haven't even

31:39.118 --> 31:41.689
bothered to open half these boxes.

31:42.595 --> 31:44.484
I didn't have the heart to,

31:44.618 --> 31:46.338
but you wouldn't understand
that, would you?

31:46.384 --> 31:47.887
No, I wouldn't.

31:48.437 --> 31:50.205
Never had a garage.

31:59.682 --> 32:01.057
Hang on.

32:04.719 --> 32:06.190
What does it say?

32:08.080 --> 32:09.510
(Chuckles)

32:09.838 --> 32:10.910
"Hey, sissy.

32:10.944 --> 32:12.573
"Looking for something?

32:12.712 --> 32:14.041
Seline."

32:16.119 --> 32:19.419
Now I know why she kept
organizing my house.

32:23.236 --> 32:24.627
(Exhales)

32:25.091 --> 32:27.307
(Sighs)

32:30.198 --> 32:33.479
I'm suddenly feeling
the need to vent.

32:51.607 --> 32:52.874
(Grunts)

33:07.244 --> 33:08.311
(Grunts)

33:08.586 --> 33:10.188
Here, go.

33:11.910 --> 33:13.322
Matt, look out!

33:20.019 --> 33:21.590
Go, go, go, go!

33:31.867 --> 33:33.008
It's okay.

33:33.101 --> 33:35.078
You finished your assignment.

33:35.973 --> 33:37.875
Sybil's done with all of you now.

33:47.187 --> 33:49.189
I think I figured it out.

33:49.242 --> 33:51.797
It's not that you're trying
to screw things up.

33:51.992 --> 33:53.648
- Thanks.
- It's more submerged.

33:53.703 --> 33:55.115
It's more subconscious
than that.

33:55.172 --> 33:56.453
What are you talking about?

33:56.516 --> 33:58.554
Despite your best efforts,
your humanity keeps

33:58.609 --> 33:59.990
flickering through

34:00.047 --> 34:01.763
because of this...

34:01.820 --> 34:03.490
Little reminder.

34:03.851 --> 34:05.656
Reminders cause problems.

34:05.695 --> 34:07.976
I told you it doesn't mean anything to me.
And I don't believe you.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.351
- Why not?
- You seem troubled.

34:09.422 --> 34:10.922
You're not enjoying our work.

34:10.976 --> 34:13.359
Oh, my God, you are
so full of crap.

34:13.460 --> 34:15.820
Fine, then prove me wrong.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.804
Prove that the past is behind us.

34:17.906 --> 34:19.760
Prove to me that you

34:19.853 --> 34:21.690
don't care.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.567
I don't.

34:42.596 --> 34:44.360

- (car alarm beeps)
- Matt: A bus just picked the kids up.

35:22.850 --> 35:24.374
They didn't remember a thing.

35:24.468 --> 35:26.257
I told them there was
a carbon monoxide leak

35:26.353 --> 35:28.055
on their way here
and that their old bus

35:28.096 --> 35:29.731
was getting towed.

35:29.834 --> 35:32.038
That's good, very thorough.

35:33.227 --> 35:35.858
Yeah, I know a lot
about making excuses.

35:36.194 --> 35:37.663
Matt.

35:37.819 --> 35:39.124
Hey!

35:39.225 --> 35:40.805
Hey, listen, what you,
what you heard from me today,

35:40.829 --> 35:43.465
and over the last few weeks,
those aren't excuses.

35:44.140 --> 35:48.242
They're details about the worst
mistake of my life.

35:49.855 --> 35:52.291
Don't make the same
mistake I did, son.

35:53.647 --> 35:55.077
Don't walk away
from your family.

35:55.186 --> 35:57.046
You know what?
Growing up,

35:57.071 --> 35:59.028
out of all my friends,
I was the only one whose family

35:59.052 --> 36:00.888
didn't have a legacy in Mystic Falls,

36:00.921 --> 36:03.397
so I felt like an outsider
in my own town.

36:03.601 --> 36:06.304
And then I find out our family
has a history, after all.

36:06.390 --> 36:07.563
That could've changed

36:07.588 --> 36:09.366
everything for me...

36:09.686 --> 36:12.232
But you never gave me a chance
to know about it.

36:17.938 --> 36:19.862
(Clears throat)

36:20.055 --> 36:22.057
(Car engine revs)

36:29.288 --> 36:31.290
(Door opens and closes)

36:32.284 --> 36:34.140
(Screams)

36:34.234 --> 36:35.366
(Shouts)

36:36.296 --> 36:37.663
Let me guess.

36:37.825 --> 36:39.546
That was Matt telling you
he managed to save

36:39.574 --> 36:41.499
my history students
from burning.

36:41.662 --> 36:43.664
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
before you get any of my blood

36:43.745 --> 36:44.749
on those stupid, little,

36:44.784 --> 36:45.827
pointy-toe boots,

36:45.894 --> 36:47.733
you'd better be 1,000% sure

36:47.788 --> 36:48.871
that I'm not still linked

36:48.896 --> 36:50.663
to your children.

36:51.342 --> 36:52.577
What do you mean?

36:52.682 --> 36:54.194
We spent a lot of time together

36:54.219 --> 36:55.380
on that little road trip we took.

36:55.404 --> 36:57.206
It was plenty of time
for me to plant

36:57.279 --> 36:58.814
an off switch in their brain

36:58.878 --> 37:01.655
and I can drop them at any second,

37:01.874 --> 37:03.684
so you better not piss me off.

37:03.717 --> 37:04.749
Yeah, you're lying.

37:04.780 --> 37:06.772
Stefan made sure
my kids would be safe.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.186
Are you certain that he thought

37:08.211 --> 37:10.296
of every possible loophole

37:10.333 --> 37:13.155
when he was bargaining
his soul away?

37:13.460 --> 37:15.117
I mean, the only way
you'll really find out

37:15.141 --> 37:17.118
is if you try to hurt me
and roll the dice.

37:17.374 --> 37:18.854
Is that what you want
to do, Caroline?

37:18.927 --> 37:20.997
You want to gamble
with your children's lives?

37:21.134 --> 37:22.836
Hmm, you know, you seem

37:22.870 --> 37:26.153
so rational when it comes
to your daughters' safety,

37:26.217 --> 37:29.200
except you still plan
on marrying a ripper.

37:29.340 --> 37:31.676
How do you not see that as
putting their lives in danger?

37:31.723 --> 37:33.192
By the time I marry Stefan,

37:33.262 --> 37:35.762
he will be the man
that I have always loved.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.567
He's gotten
through ripper sprees before.

37:37.642 --> 37:38.944
Yet every single time,

37:39.016 --> 37:40.965
he manages to find a way
to fall off

37:41.043 --> 37:41.911
the wagon...

37:41.980 --> 37:44.770
Every... Single... time.

37:45.184 --> 37:47.695
Do you know what the definition
of insanity is?

37:47.728 --> 37:49.317
It's doing the same thing

37:49.386 --> 37:52.622
over and over again and
expecting a different result.

37:52.866 --> 37:54.926
(Chuckles) (Inhales)

38:00.100 --> 38:03.411
I just hope that the next time
he goes ripper,

38:03.801 --> 38:06.013
your kids aren't in the house.

38:06.317 --> 38:09.016
(Exhales)

38:12.940 --> 38:14.512
(Sighs)

38:22.453 --> 38:24.007
Damon: Psst.

38:26.828 --> 38:28.265
Uh, if you got any questions,

38:28.292 --> 38:30.039
the C.O. can show you our permit.

38:30.107 --> 38:31.976
You find anything valuable
around here?

38:32.072 --> 38:34.508
Candy wrappers
and fast-food bags.

38:34.617 --> 38:37.382
Well, that doesn't help
my existential crisis.

38:37.484 --> 38:38.489
I was driving through here

38:38.513 --> 38:39.937
last night with my brother.

38:40.047 --> 38:41.625
We got into a heated moment

38:41.689 --> 38:43.312
and threw something
out the window.

38:43.439 --> 38:44.981
Maybe he should help you
look for it, then.

38:45.005 --> 38:47.374
Oh, he took the morning off
from work.

38:52.058 --> 38:55.194
Damon: Besides, he doesn't want
me to have this thing, anyway.

38:55.829 --> 38:58.632
Honestly, I don't even know
why I want it.

38:58.828 --> 39:01.593
'Cause whenever I have
it, I just feel...

39:02.320 --> 39:03.771
Better.

39:03.859 --> 39:04.992
In that case, it sounds like

39:05.033 --> 39:07.531
- your brother's kind of a jerk.
- He can be.

39:07.651 --> 39:09.109

39:09.414 --> 39:10.906
Only child.
