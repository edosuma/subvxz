12:21.160 --> 12:22.730
Afternoon, Detective.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.687
Oh. Hey, Allen.

12:26.880 --> 12:31.169
Hey. So, I told Captain Mendez you were
canvasing for the Jefferson case again.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.407
Breath mint?

12:32.640 --> 12:36.645
What... Why are you talking to Captain
about me?

12:37.160 --> 12:40.687
Oh, well, you're just a little late again.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.050
That's my business, not yours.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.725
I was just trying to help you out.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.882
Am I wearing a sign that says "help me"?

12:48.120 --> 12:49.360
You might as well be.

12:49.560 --> 12:53.531
Look, like they say in the movies,
we're not partners and we're not friends.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.609
You don't know me, you don't know my life.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.201
So, why the sudden interest
in me keeping my lousy job?

12:58.400 --> 13:01.290
And what the hell
makes me so interesting to you, Mr. Allen?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.084

-What?

13:16.440 --> 13:18.886
No. I do not approve.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.642
- Hi, Barry.
-Hey.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.888
- Dad.
-lris.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.528
You think it's a good idea
dating somebody I work with?

13:29.520 --> 13:30.760
It's just a lunch.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.122
And, truthfully,
I wasn't even sure you still worked here.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.689
- You ready?
-Yeah, let's do it.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.081
Okay.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.085
- This way?
-Yeah, I just got to grab my jacket.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.566
I'm sorry about that mini-scene

13:49.800 --> 13:51.404
-with my dad earlier.
-Oh, yeah.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.765
Don't worry about it.
I just feel bad for him and you.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.165
You barely even know us.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.686
Feels like I do.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.287
Is that weird?
Is that a weird thing to say?

14:06.960 --> 14:11.522
No. No, I mean, strangely,
I know what you mean.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.046
I never say yes to guys
asking me out like that,

14:16.240 --> 14:17.844
yet I said yes to you.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.611
Why did I do that?

14:22.240 --> 14:23.287
I don't know.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.484
Some people are just
meant to be in your life, I guess.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.403
So, tell me about you.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.051
- Yeah.
-Mom and Dad?

14:33.120 --> 14:34.804
Uh, alive and well.

-Mmm-hmm.

We are, yeah, very.
I couldn't imagine life without them.

14:42.680 --> 14:46.002
They're, like, stupid in love.
I hope I have what they have some day.

is that it?

14:51.520 --> 14:55.002
That's the thing about the right girl.
She's out there, waiting.

come walking through that door.

the same thing.

when I was fighting The Rival,

16:59.240 --> 17:00.287
and he already knew who I was.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.006
Is that why you asked me out?
Because my brother is The Flash?

17:03.320 --> 17:06.085
(CHUCKLES)
No, no, this is a complete coincidence.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.521
Okay, how'd you know
who I was under the mask?

Uh, I'm CSI, you know?
So, I just put it together.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.040
So, what I don't know is
how you got your speed.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.971
Oh, okay, so before I went on
the straight and narrow,

17:19.160 --> 17:21.925
- I used to drive illegal cars.
-Uh-huh.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.642
I was messing around with a new nitro
formula to get my engine revving faster.

17:25.839 --> 17:28.047
Then, one night,
I'm racing in a thunderstorm,

17:28.240 --> 17:29.651
my car gets struck by lightning!

17:30.160 --> 17:33.528
And, then, it must have mixed
with the formula, because, boom!

17:33.720 --> 17:35.484

Reverse Flash from killing my mom.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.247

I created an alternate timeline,

-Kid Flash.

out there where I'm not rich?

Hey... (SNAPS FINGERS) We got something.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.925
Turns out kiddie eye doc here
actually had a good idea.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.329
I have always wondered why no one
turned the speed cameras in the city

27:19.520 --> 27:21.363
to register near-sonic velocities.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.801

27:24.000 --> 27:25.570

Listen to him, Wally. He's The Flash.

27:37.480 --> 27:40.643
You know, you would be
an excellent candidate for Lasik.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.211

Is that like a thing, "flanking"?

27:57.160 --> 27:59.162
What're you talking about, flanking--
Yes, flanking's a thing.

27:59.440 --> 28:03.365

38:56.800 --> 38:59.963
You're safe. You're safe now.

39:01.080 --> 39:04.448
Actually, she's not.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.602
(GASPS)

39:13.120 --> 39:14.167
Please don't hurt me.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.364
No. No!

39:23.280 --> 39:24.281
No!

39:30.600 --> 39:31.681
(BARRY PANTING)

39:31.880 --> 39:35.885
EOBARD: There we go.
Things are back to how they should be.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.804
Well, for me, anyway. For you...

39:41.480 --> 39:42.527
(CHUCKLES)

39:43.120 --> 39:46.806
Well, I guess
you'll just have to wait and find out.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.963
What? What does that mean?

39:50.480 --> 39:52.164
See you sometime soon, Flash.

40:02.720 --> 40:03.801
(DOOR OPENS)

40:10.560 --> 40:11.641
What's this for?

40:11.920 --> 40:13.410
Just glad you're here.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.207
Are you okay?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.001
Whoa...

40:20.200 --> 40:22.043
Yeah, I am now. Yeah.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.845
You just lost your father, Barry,
you don't have to be okay.

40:28.680 --> 40:32.207
Actually, I feel closer to my parents
than I ever have.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.245
VVeH,good,son.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.131
- To your pops.
-To Henry.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.691
To my dad.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.041
Where's Iris?

40:46.720 --> 40:47.767
That ain't funny.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.286
I'm gonna chalk that up to grief.
I'll see you both in the morning.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.201
What was that about?

40:58.600 --> 41:01.046
Are you kidding me?
You know Iris isn't here.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.201
What?

41:02.400 --> 41:05.131
They don't talk, Barry. You know that.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.122
Oh, God, What did I do?

41:26.000 --> 41:31.404
- MALE VOICE: Clariss. Clariss!
-(GRUNTS)

41:32.600 --> 41:34.090
