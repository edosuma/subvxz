00:10.488 --> 00:11.968
- Let me go.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.100
- Silence.

00:13.143 --> 00:16.059
Let me enjoy
this moment.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.846
- Kal!
- Vordo, get down!

00:20.890 --> 00:23.327
- He'll never let
you have his ship.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.329
- Let her go, Vordo!

00:25.373 --> 00:27.070
[Vordo laughing evilly]

00:27.114 --> 00:29.072
- Oh, my dear Galanica.

00:29.116 --> 00:32.380
I'm not talking about his ship.
I'm talking about you.

00:32.423 --> 00:35.122
- [Tess]:
I'm not his possession!

00:35.165 --> 00:38.081
- You're right.
Now you're mine.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.388
[Vordo laughing]

00:40.431 --> 00:42.085
- You'd be smart
to let me go!

00:42.129 --> 00:43.652
- It is pointless to resist.

00:43.695 --> 00:44.696
- Nice try, Vordo!

00:44.740 --> 00:46.568
- What?

00:46.611 --> 00:48.091
[Groaning]

00:48.135 --> 00:51.268
- I never doubted you, Kal.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.096
- [Man 1]: And cut!

00:53.140 --> 00:55.098
- [Director]:
OK, that's it for Scene 14.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.708
[Crew talking simultaneously]

00:56.752 --> 00:58.710
Back for Scene 22
in 40 minutes.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.147
- Thanks. Vordo!

01:00.190 --> 01:02.671
- [Man 2 on radio]:
OK, that's it for Scene 14.

01:02.714 --> 01:03.976
[Grunting]

01:04.019 --> 01:05.239
- Thanks, bro.
- No probs.

01:05.282 --> 01:06.762
- [Woman on radio]:
Copy that.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.590
- [Director]:
We need hair and makeup.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.461
- See what I did there
with my blaster?

01:10.505 --> 01:11.984
- What?

01:12.028 --> 01:14.639
- I drew it across my body
with my left hand and shot.

01:14.683 --> 01:17.425
- [Director]: Boom was
borderline in the last shot.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.296
- OK!
- Character's right-handed!

01:19.340 --> 01:20.645
- Wow!

01:20.689 --> 01:22.082
- You might not
be impressed,

01:22.125 --> 01:24.171
but the message boards
are gonna go crazy.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.042
You'll see.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.306
- Aren't you worried that people
will think you made a mistake?

01:29.350 --> 01:32.266
- Or they'll think that Kal
had that experimental surgery

01:32.309 --> 01:33.789
we alluded to
3 episodes ago.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.792
- I think maybe you had
that experimental surgery.

01:36.835 --> 01:40.274
- Hey, during our summer hiatus,
let's go to the cottage.

01:40.317 --> 01:41.797
- What cottage?

01:41.840 --> 01:43.190
- Our cottage.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.191
[Laughing]

01:44.234 --> 01:47.063
- Yeah? Where is
this cottage?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.065
- Hmm, Martha's Vineyard.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.980
- I don't know!
Sounds expensive!

01:51.023 --> 01:53.069
- Look around.
We're big TV stars.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.637
- No, honey,
we are cable-TV stars.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.118
Martha's Vineyard is
for network-TV stars.

01:58.161 --> 02:01.077
- All right, well, how about
Marty's Vineyard, then?

02:01.121 --> 02:03.166
- How about we just
go to a vineyard?

02:03.210 --> 02:04.602
I think that sounds nice.

02:04.646 --> 02:05.995
- Well, I want a cottage!

02:06.038 --> 02:07.039
- Hi, guys!

02:07.083 --> 02:08.389
- Hey, Nikki!
- Hi!

02:08.431 --> 02:11.783
- So, I have the
season finale script...

02:11.827 --> 02:12.784
- Oh, great!

02:12.828 --> 02:14.177
- ...hot off the press.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.832
Um, also, I just wanted
to let you guys know

02:16.875 --> 02:18.355
I have everything arranged

02:18.399 --> 02:20.749
for the sci-fi
convention this weekend.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.142
The suite you asked for

02:22.185 --> 02:24.144
is under the name
Jacques Strap?

02:24.187 --> 02:25.188
[Chuckling]

02:25.232 --> 02:26.885
They're going to
have your yoga ball,

02:26.929 --> 02:29.279
and they're also gonna have
the mini-fridge stocked

02:29.323 --> 02:31.194
with the sports drink
that Hunter likes.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.457
Uh, oh yes, and the
prescription you asked for

02:33.501 --> 02:34.458
is in your trailer.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.807
- You're a lifesaver.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.201
Really, I don't know
what we'd do without you.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.376
- Nikki, there you are!

02:39.420 --> 02:41.465
Come on, the rest
of the cast are asking

02:41.509 --> 02:43.424
where their scripts
are for the finale.

02:43.467 --> 02:44.903
- Oh yeah--

02:44.947 --> 02:47.384
- That's me, James.
I had Nikki doing stuff.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.430
- OK, whatever.
Just get it done, OK?

02:49.473 --> 02:51.910
- OK. Thank you.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.477
- OK.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.043
- [Nikki]: So?

03:38.087 --> 03:39.262
- It was so good.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.308
- What about that twist?
I mean...

03:41.351 --> 03:42.352
[All giggling]

03:42.396 --> 03:44.485
- I didn't see it
coming at all!

03:44.528 --> 03:47.357
Thanks for letting us read it.
- Yeah, thanks.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.098
- Oh my God!
I love Kal so much!

03:49.141 --> 03:50.665
- OK, guys, remember,

03:50.708 --> 03:53.494
you cannot post or tweet or
say anything about this, OK?

03:53.537 --> 03:55.235
- Yeah, you already
told us that.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.932
- I'm just saying

03:56.975 --> 03:59.239
if any spoilers get out,
it'll hurt the show,

03:59.282 --> 04:02.329
and then there won't be any
more of these advanced readings,

04:02.372 --> 04:04.331
and you'll be out of the club!

04:04.374 --> 04:05.767
- I started this club.

04:05.810 --> 04:06.768
- Doesn't matter.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.160
If you hurt the show,

04:08.204 --> 04:10.989
you don't deserve
to be part of the club.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.166
- [Nasal]: If you
hurt the show,

04:14.210 --> 04:16.343
you don't deserve to
be part of the club.

04:16.386 --> 04:17.822
- Come on,
we gotta zip it.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.694
[Hunter grunting]

04:20.695 --> 04:21.957
[Tess groaning]

04:22.000 --> 04:23.263
- That bad, huh?

04:23.306 --> 04:24.786
[Grunting]

04:24.829 --> 04:27.919
- In a nutshell, Galanica
does something stupid

04:27.963 --> 04:30.618
and, spoiler alert,
you have to rescue me.

04:30.661 --> 04:34.404
So, wait for me to put all
that fight training to good use.

04:34.448 --> 04:37.755
It's basically the same thing
that happens every episode,

04:37.799 --> 04:41.324
except in this episode, I'm
half-naked for the entire thing.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.413
- Well, I like
the sound of that!

04:43.457 --> 04:45.110
- Come on! I'm serious.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.677
- Hey!

04:46.721 --> 04:50.246
I'm just happy they still wanna
see us naked at this age, huh?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.727
- You're part of the problem!

04:52.770 --> 04:54.206
- What's the problem?

04:54.250 --> 04:56.296
We're actors!
We play characters.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.645
- Yeah?

04:57.688 --> 04:59.995
You play an alien
bimbo for 7 years

05:00.038 --> 05:02.519
and tell me you don't
get sick of it.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.478
- I get that
you're frustrated,

05:04.521 --> 05:06.436
but I also remember
auditioning

05:06.480 --> 05:08.656
for one line
in some crappy movie.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.876
I guess what I'm saying is
I just appreciate what I have.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.661
- I appreciate it too.

05:13.704 --> 05:16.011
It's just, it's
different for women.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.795
We have a best-before date,

05:17.839 --> 05:19.928
and I don't want
to waste my time

05:19.971 --> 05:22.800
playing some character
that I'm not proud of.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.454
- Is this about
that article?

05:24.498 --> 05:25.803
[Scoffing]

05:25.847 --> 05:28.371
Who cares what the press
says about your character?

05:28.415 --> 05:31.374
Think about the millions of fans
all over the world

05:31.418 --> 05:32.636
who love Galanica.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.378
- What about my
opinion of her?

05:35.422 --> 05:38.599
- Well, I mean,
if you feel that strongly,

05:38.642 --> 05:40.427
better talk to James.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.562
- [James]: Yeah.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.695
What?

05:47.738 --> 05:50.741
No! Oh, come on!

05:50.785 --> 05:52.090
Come-- Dan!

05:52.134 --> 05:53.788
No, no, no!

05:53.831 --> 05:56.486
She has--she has 4 scenes
to shoot today.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.270
Four! Yeah!

06:00.229 --> 06:02.057
I don't need excuses, Dan.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.626
I need my stuff to stop
walking off the lot!

06:05.669 --> 06:07.715
- What's missing now?

06:07.758 --> 06:08.759
- Your costume.

06:08.803 --> 06:09.760
- Uh, found it!

06:09.804 --> 06:11.240
- That's your backup.
- Oh!

06:11.283 --> 06:13.851
OK, so that's why you wrote in
a new wardrobe for me

06:13.895 --> 06:14.939
for the finale.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.941
- You don't like
the space bikini?

06:16.985 --> 06:18.421
- Not so much!

06:18.465 --> 06:21.337
- A bikini did wonders for
another famous sci-fi heroine.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.427
- Yeah, in the '80s. I feel
like we're going backwards.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.821
- You know this has
already been negotiated

06:26.864 --> 06:28.257
into your
contract, right?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.041
- Listen. It's not
just the bikini.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.739
It's that every week,

06:31.782 --> 06:34.176
Kal is the hero and he has
to rescue Galanica.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.353
- Is this about the article?
'Cause I don't see it that way.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.573
Besides, she has a
kick-ass fighting staff.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.313
- Yeah, a kick-ass
fighting staff

06:41.357 --> 06:43.533
that she uses as a
glorified walking stick.

06:43.577 --> 06:46.406
- Because she knows that
violence is never the answer.

06:46.449 --> 06:49.626
- Listen, I'm not asking you
to change my character.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.063
I'm just saying
maybe to keep it fresh,

06:52.107 --> 06:53.369
we do an episode

06:53.413 --> 06:55.806
where Galanica's the hero
and she saves Kal.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.417
- Gentilians are a servant race.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.158
The females get strength
from how they help the males.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.639
It's actually a source of
strength, not weakness.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.598
- OK, have you seen
the message boards?

07:04.641 --> 07:07.383
Because I'm not sure that
everybody sees it that way.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.863
- Have you seen our ratings?

07:08.906 --> 07:09.994
[Cell ringing]

07:10.038 --> 07:11.866
Yeah, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it!

07:11.909 --> 07:14.129

something good!

07:14.172 --> 07:15.609

07:15.652 --> 07:16.653
- He's a dickhead!

07:16.697 --> 07:18.002
- Well, tomato, to-mah-to.

07:18.046 --> 07:20.483
At least you got
to say your piece.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.311
- Yeah, a lot of
good it did me.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.400
Why don't you do
a little indie film,

07:24.444 --> 07:27.621
remind yourself what it's
like to be a starving artist?

07:27.664 --> 07:31.189
- Or I could go to Times Square
and be one of those people

07:31.233 --> 07:33.583
that poses with tourists
for photographs.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.542
- Hmm! You could
play Galanica.

07:35.585 --> 07:36.891
- I already have
a costume!

07:36.934 --> 07:38.806
- You could charge
money for pictures.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.155
- Yeah, like $15
a picture!

07:40.198 --> 07:41.765

are you Tess Daniels?

you as Masha

the Carling years ago.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.470

07:50.513 --> 07:53.560
Um, that's not one
that I hear a lot.

transcendent.

- I'm sorry?

08:01.655 --> 08:04.484
- Well, how did you
get from doing that

08:04.527 --> 08:07.661
to some soap opera in space?

08:07.704 --> 08:09.097
It's a shame.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.535

watching the show.

You're right.

08:22.589 --> 08:23.720
You're right.

08:23.764 --> 08:27.158
Galanica is a
misogynistic archetype,

08:27.202 --> 08:30.901
and she is a terrible
role model for girls, so...

- Um, I was just dropping off
the revised schedules.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.995
- No, you're not.

09:21.038 --> 09:24.912
Because I have a script revision
I need you to distribute,

09:24.955 --> 09:26.174
but only to Tess.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.175

20:57.473 --> 20:59.083
- I know, I know.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.738
I just, I really wanna
sleep in my own bed.

21:03.131 --> 21:06.265
- OK. Give me an hour.
I can be ready.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.745
- No, you--you should stay.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.359
- Is that a real offer?

21:13.402 --> 21:15.796
- As opposed to what?

21:15.839 --> 21:18.059
- One of those where
I'm supposed to know

21:18.102 --> 21:20.279
that the real answer
is something like:

21:20.322 --> 21:21.976
"No, I'll come
back with you."

21:22.019 --> 21:23.369
[Laughing]

21:23.412 --> 21:25.109
- No!

21:25.153 --> 21:27.460
No, you--you have a
late call tomorrow,

21:27.503 --> 21:30.201
and you should stay,
have a good time.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.812
- You can trust me.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.466
- I know. I do.

21:33.509 --> 21:36.382
- I'll see you
on set tomorrow.

21:36.425 --> 21:37.383
- OK.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.427
Mmm!

21:39.428 --> 21:40.473
- I love you.

21:40.516 --> 21:41.952
- I love you too.

21:44.215 --> 21:46.305
[Sighing]

22:20.991 --> 22:22.645
[Giggling]

22:22.689 --> 22:25.169
- This is a little
bit embarrassing,

22:25.213 --> 22:28.172
but I've locked myself out.

22:28.216 --> 22:29.348
[Giggling]

23:04.948 --> 23:06.602
[Sniffing]

23:13.653 --> 23:16.525
[Sighing]

23:58.001 --> 23:59.220
- Hey!- Hey!

23:59.263 --> 24:00.569
- Where are
your friends?

24:00.613 --> 24:03.050
- They're at the "build your
own costume" seminar.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.747
- Hmm!
- You're done for the day.

24:04.791 --> 24:05.879
- Yeah, that's a wrap.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.881
- Do you have any
plans for the night?

24:07.924 --> 24:08.969
- Nothing major.

24:09.012 --> 24:10.927
Maybe just a quick
workout in the room,

24:10.971 --> 24:12.538
maybe hit the
tables for a bit.

24:12.581 --> 24:13.930
- Cool!
- [Woman]: Kal!

24:13.974 --> 24:15.105
[Footsteps approaching]

24:15.149 --> 24:16.890
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

24:16.933 --> 24:17.934
- You found me.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.545
- Can we take a photo
for my Insta?

24:19.588 --> 24:20.546
- Definitely.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.069
- Do you mind?
- Sure.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.244
[Woman chuckling]

24:24.767 --> 24:26.377
[Camera clicking]

24:26.421 --> 24:27.378
Got it!

24:27.422 --> 24:28.858
- OK, just
one more?

24:28.902 --> 24:30.207
- Yep!

24:33.907 --> 24:34.864
OK!

24:34.908 --> 24:36.083
- Thanks.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.693
Um, I'm in Room 408,

24:37.737 --> 24:42.089
if you wanna stop by for
a drink later or something.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.616
- [Nikki]: Yikes!

24:47.660 --> 24:48.617
[Hunter chuckling]

24:48.661 --> 24:50.967
- Uh, I'll see
you tomorrow?

24:51.011 --> 24:53.317
- Yeah, I will
see you tomorrow.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.318
- OK.
- OK.

24:54.362 --> 24:55.624
- Bye!
- Bye!

25:00.150 --> 25:01.500
[Shower running]

25:01.543 --> 25:03.110
[Knocking on door]

25:07.462 --> 25:08.419
[Chuckling]

25:08.463 --> 25:09.551
- Yes?

25:09.595 --> 25:11.292
- I have a message for you.

25:11.335 --> 25:12.815
- From Hunter?

25:12.859 --> 25:13.947
- No, from me.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.645
Just stay the hell
away from him,

25:16.689 --> 25:18.908
and don't mess
with my show.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.606
- Your show?

25:22.303 --> 25:25.132
- You heard me, bitch.
- Get lost, freak!

25:25.175 --> 25:27.656
[Grunting]

25:28.744 --> 25:30.224
[Screaming]

25:33.183 --> 25:35.838
[Woman whimpering]

25:35.882 --> 25:37.710
[Panting]

25:37.753 --> 25:40.539
- He is married!

25:40.582 --> 25:44.281
If you even look at him again,
I will kill you!

25:44.325 --> 25:47.284
[Grunting, panting]

25:47.328 --> 25:48.634
[Groaning]

25:48.677 --> 25:50.723
Do you hear me, slut?

25:50.766 --> 25:52.899
[Panting]

25:59.601 --> 26:02.909
[Giggling, sighing]

26:18.185 --> 26:20.535
- [Marlyn]: I have my share
of interesting fans,

26:20.579 --> 26:23.494
but I'm sure it's nothing compared to what you're used to.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.453
- They're harmless,
and they mean well.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.934
It's just, it's crazy to me
when there's someone

26:27.977 --> 26:30.414
who knows more about
your character than you do.

26:30.458 --> 26:34.375
OK, I'm just putting
my cards on the table.

26:34.418 --> 26:39.380
So, speaking of character,
I love, love your play.

26:39.423 --> 26:41.121
- Thank you!

26:41.164 --> 26:43.558
- Please tell me that
you haven't set the lead yet.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.038
- No!

26:45.081 --> 26:47.518
- I wanna read for this.

26:47.562 --> 26:51.000
I haven't had anything speak
to me like this in a long time,

26:51.044 --> 26:54.917
and I know that
I may have typecast myself

26:54.961 --> 26:57.311
the last couple of years,

26:57.354 --> 26:59.792
but I--I can do this role.

26:59.835 --> 27:03.578
- It's just that the producers
are insisting on casting someone

27:03.622 --> 27:06.973
who'd be available if the run
were extended into the fall.

27:07.016 --> 27:08.409
- Oh.

27:08.452 --> 27:11.281
- And I realize you'll
be back on the show,

27:11.325 --> 27:13.632
and that's not
an option for you.

27:15.764 --> 27:18.158
- What if it was an option?

27:41.398 --> 27:43.270
- Hunter?

28:20.960 --> 28:23.789
[Sighing]

28:44.418 --> 28:46.420
[Grunting]

28:48.901 --> 28:50.903
[Cell phone buzzing]

29:01.696 --> 29:05.569
- Hey, I just wanted
to call and say good night.

29:05.613 --> 29:08.790
I hope you're having fun.
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:28.244 --> 29:30.507
[Camera beeping slowly]

29:32.858 --> 29:34.990
[Camera beeping rapidly]

29:35.034 --> 29:37.558
[Camera clicking]

29:37.601 --> 29:40.169
[Camera beeping and clicking]

29:52.138 --> 29:54.923
- Still think I'm lying?

29:54.967 --> 29:56.664
[Nikki chuckling]

29:56.707 --> 29:58.448
- Why are you wearing the wig?

29:58.492 --> 30:00.450
- OK, sometimes,
we do this thing

30:00.494 --> 30:02.539
where he keeps on
his Kal costume,

30:02.583 --> 30:04.498
and I dress up
like Galanica.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.240
Well?

30:07.283 --> 30:10.547
- How are we supposed to know
this isn't photoshopped?

30:10.591 --> 30:12.549
- Seriously?

30:12.593 --> 30:15.117
What do I have to do,
film us doing it?

30:15.161 --> 30:16.292
- That would help.

30:16.336 --> 30:18.729
- OK, OK, OK.
Just take another look.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.862
I mean, look where
his hands are!

30:20.906 --> 30:23.473
I mean, do you think
I could fake that?

30:24.518 --> 30:27.216
- I don't know. Maybe.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.350
[Chuckling]

30:30.393 --> 30:32.743
- I mean,
you believe me, right?

30:32.787 --> 30:34.006
- Yes.

30:34.049 --> 30:35.746
[Sighing]

30:36.747 --> 30:38.140
- What?

30:38.184 --> 30:39.968
- Don't you feel guilty?

30:40.012 --> 30:43.102
- No! I mean, him and Tess
have an understanding.

30:43.145 --> 30:45.234
- I mean, using him
for his body.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.976
- He gets something
from it too, you know.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.677
Jeez, what is with you guys?

30:53.721 --> 30:56.419
I thought you'd
be happy for me.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.168
[Door opening]

31:07.604 --> 31:09.258
- Hey, babe!

31:09.302 --> 31:12.131
- Hey! Late night?

31:12.174 --> 31:13.784
- Yeah.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.657
I overstayed my welcome
at the blackjack table.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.529
- Well, I hope you
ordered enough free drinks

31:19.573 --> 31:20.748
to cover your loss.

31:20.791 --> 31:21.749
- Yeah.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.229
[Hunter clearing throat]

31:23.272 --> 31:25.013
You seem like you're
in a good mood.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.232
- I am!

31:26.275 --> 31:27.494
- Any particular reason?

31:27.537 --> 31:28.669
- I don't know.

31:28.712 --> 31:31.193
I just got a good
night's sleep.

31:31.237 --> 31:34.805
Um, I called you last night
around 11:00 or so.

31:34.849 --> 31:38.070
- Yeah, sorry, I accidentally
left the phone up in the room.

31:38.113 --> 31:40.072
Uh, by the time
I got your message,

31:40.115 --> 31:42.770
I just figured it was
too late to call, so...

31:42.813 --> 31:46.121
- All right, no worries.
OK, I'm gonna go get dressed.

31:46.165 --> 31:47.427
- OK, see you out there.

31:47.470 --> 31:48.689
- Yep!

31:53.737 --> 31:57.176
- Um, so, you remember
that thing yesterday

31:57.219 --> 32:00.875
with my friend saying
that I was a producer?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.486
I have no idea where
she got that idea.

32:03.530 --> 32:06.359
- I'm sure it was
a misunderstanding.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.013
- All right,
good to go!

32:08.056 --> 32:09.884
- All right, back to it.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.027
- What you reading?

32:22.070 --> 32:24.290
- Oh, it's a play I might do.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.421
- When?

32:25.465 --> 32:27.902
- Um, hiatus.
It'd just be a short run.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.687
- [James on radio]:
Nikki, we need Tess on Set 5.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.341
- Yeah, I'm flying
her in now.

32:32.385 --> 32:35.431
- Hey, don't mention that
to anybody, even Hunter, OK?

32:35.475 --> 32:37.303
- Well, he doesn't
know about it?

32:37.346 --> 32:40.088
- I just haven't found
a right time to tell him.

32:40.132 --> 32:41.785
Um, do you have plans later?

32:41.829 --> 32:42.786
- No.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.353
- I know it's short notice,

32:44.397 --> 32:46.660
but you think maybe
you could come over

32:46.703 --> 32:48.401
and help me
run lines tonight?

32:48.444 --> 32:50.142
- Yeah! No, I'd
love to, sure.

32:50.185 --> 32:53.232
- You are such
a lifesaver, Nikki!

33:01.762 --> 33:05.505
- You have a decision to make.
Are you or aren't you a traitor?

33:05.548 --> 33:07.550
- But what do
you want me to do?

33:07.594 --> 33:09.857
- Decide if you're
gonna help me or not.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.337
- Help you do what?

33:11.380 --> 33:13.295
- Get what is
rightfully ours.

33:14.296 --> 33:15.254
- That was great.

33:15.297 --> 33:16.255
- Ugh!

33:16.298 --> 33:17.778
- Do you wanna
run it again?

33:17.821 --> 33:19.214
- No, I feel
good about it.

33:19.258 --> 33:20.607
- [Whispering]: OK.

33:22.957 --> 33:25.525
- Hey, do you want
a glass of wine?

33:26.569 --> 33:28.180
- Yeah, sure!

[Chuckling]

33:35.230 --> 33:37.232
[Glasses clinking]

33:39.800 --> 33:41.715
- You're a
good actor, Nikki!

33:41.758 --> 33:42.716
- Really?

33:42.759 --> 33:43.804
[Cork popping]

33:43.847 --> 33:44.805
Thanks!

33:44.848 --> 33:46.154
[Giggling]

33:51.420 --> 33:53.118
I've never seen that.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.946
Um, it's, like,
a 100-episode commemorative,

33:55.990 --> 33:57.078
uh, crystal thing.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.253
What is that?

33:58.297 --> 34:00.168
- Yeah, the network
made that for us,

34:00.212 --> 34:02.562
for the executive
producers and the cast.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.042
100 episodes.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.217
- It's beautiful.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.306
- Hmm! It's so funny.

34:07.349 --> 34:11.179
When I was first offered
Galanica, I didn't wanna do it.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.399
And my manager
talked me into it

34:13.442 --> 34:16.576
and swore that the
show would only go

34:16.619 --> 34:19.100
one season, two, tops.

34:19.143 --> 34:22.712
And then I met Hunter,
and we fell in love,

34:22.755 --> 34:25.280
and here we are,
7 years later.

34:25.324 --> 34:29.110
- Well, I am really glad
your manager did not know

34:29.154 --> 34:31.112
what he was talking about.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.809
- Yeah, me too.

34:33.897 --> 34:35.507
- To 7 more years.

34:35.551 --> 34:36.552
[Chuckling]

34:40.034 --> 34:41.340
- Hmm...

34:41.382 --> 34:44.255
So, have you watched
the show from the beginning?

34:44.299 --> 34:45.648
- Yep! First episode.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.911
- And sci-fi
is your thing.

34:47.955 --> 34:50.217
- Absolutely my thing.

34:50.262 --> 34:53.612
Um, I was actually sick
a lot as a child,

34:53.656 --> 34:56.181
and I didn't have
very many friends.

34:56.224 --> 35:00.010
Um, my brother, though, he had
these little action figures

35:00.054 --> 35:02.100
from the sci-fi
movies and stuff,

35:02.143 --> 35:05.277
and I would make these worlds
for them to live in.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.669
It was...

35:06.713 --> 35:10.020
It was kind of like
a dollhouse for...

35:10.064 --> 35:11.152
for aliens.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.414
[Chuckling]

35:12.458 --> 35:14.416
Um, a psychiatrist
actually once said

35:14.460 --> 35:17.071
that it was--it was me
looking to gain control

35:17.115 --> 35:19.639
where I didn't have
any in my real life.

35:19.682 --> 35:22.163
And, um, yeah,
then I grew up,

35:22.207 --> 35:25.079
and I discovered
the shows myself,

35:25.123 --> 35:28.430
and, uh, found these
fan communities

35:28.474 --> 35:30.519
of people who are
just like me.

needed a night alone

to think about her options.

I didn't cheat on her.

I believe you.

- Really? Because you
might be the only one.

told her that you messed up

that maybe...

most important thing

- Oh yeah!
- It's really nepotism.

and that's what I'm doing!

- Nikki, come on!
Let me out!

are you doing?

be losing it a little.

to hear me out,

and--and you'll
understand everything.

explain anything.

You just need
to let her go.

- Well, I can't
do that right now.

I am calling the police.

to fix things!

to commit a felony!

- No, I have a plan.
You just don't understand yet.

to be mad at you.

She is going to thank you.
- Why?

01:10:03.721 --> 01:10:05.288

going to realize

that we stopped her
from making a huge mistake!

knew you were weird.

you were delusional.

leaked that photo of us...

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:00.958
Da.OK.

01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:03.090
- Were you just
speaking Gentilian?

01:14:03.134 --> 01:14:05.005
- Yeah, sometimes
it's just easier.

01:14:05.049 --> 01:14:06.311
- Than what, English?

01:14:06.354 --> 01:14:09.009
- This is all gonna make
sense in just a minute.

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:18.236
- Tess!

01:14:18.279 --> 01:14:20.499
Tess!

01:14:28.289 --> 01:14:30.291
[Panting]

01:14:30.335 --> 01:14:32.859
You OK?
- Yeah, yeah, no.

01:14:32.903 --> 01:14:34.165
No, no.
She's fine.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.775
- [Hunter]:
What are you doing?

01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:38.299
- I know you're freaked out,
and I understand.

01:14:38.343 --> 01:14:40.345
But you just gotta trust me, OK?

01:14:40.388 --> 01:14:43.391
I'm actually gonna need you
to get in that box.

01:14:43.435 --> 01:14:44.741
Um, and...

01:14:44.784 --> 01:14:46.133
[Giggling]

01:14:46.177 --> 01:14:47.874
Put this on.

01:14:50.529 --> 01:14:52.400
- [Tess]:
Come on, Hunter.

01:14:52.444 --> 01:14:55.534
Hunter, come in. OK?

01:14:56.796 --> 01:14:58.189
- [Whispering]: Go.

01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:03.890
- It's OK.
- Get in.

01:15:03.934 --> 01:15:05.762
- It's OK, Dana.
It's OK.

01:15:08.678 --> 01:15:10.462
- Dana?

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:14.553
- It's OK. You don't
really wanna hurt me, OK?

01:15:14.597 --> 01:15:16.076
[Breathing heavily]

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.252
It's OK.
Everybody's OK.

01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:19.776
Just...

01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:22.909
OK, don't do anything.

01:15:23.954 --> 01:15:25.390
- Go!

01:15:25.433 --> 01:15:27.218
- Nikki!

01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:30.003
- Come on, Nikki!
Come on!

01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:31.918
[Panting, laughing]

01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:36.096
- You're fired!

01:15:39.622 --> 01:15:40.884
- Hi, Hunter.

01:15:40.927 --> 01:15:43.539
Do you remember me
from the convention?

01:15:43.582 --> 01:15:44.931
- No!

01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:47.630
- We met.

01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:49.066
I took a selfie with you,

01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:51.503
and I use it for the
wallpaper on my phone.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.287
- OK, Dana, that's enough.

01:15:53.331 --> 01:15:55.289
Can you get changed, please?

01:15:58.641 --> 01:16:00.338
- Just do it.

01:16:01.382 --> 01:16:02.732
- What do you want, Nikki?

01:16:02.775 --> 01:16:04.734
- I don't want
anything from you.

01:16:04.777 --> 01:16:06.387
I'm doing this for you.

01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:07.867
- What?

01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:10.957
- You don't want Tess to do
the play, either, right?

01:16:11.001 --> 01:16:12.698
- What?

01:16:12.742 --> 01:16:14.265
- When that photo
was leaked,

01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:16.659
she said she was gonna
leave you and the show.

01:16:16.702 --> 01:16:19.357
I mean, she was
acting impulsive,

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.577
so I--I just thought
I would keep her here

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.057
so she didn't do
anything she regretted.

01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:26.843
- So, this is your psychotic
version of a time-out?

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:28.496
- No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.412
This is me risking everything,
putting everything on the line

01:16:31.456 --> 01:16:33.763
for the sake of the show
and your relationship.

01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:35.765
[Nikki chuckling]

01:16:35.808 --> 01:16:38.768
- Nikki just wants
what's best. Me too.

01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:40.421
- OK.

01:16:40.465 --> 01:16:43.381
Hey, I know
what you're doing.

01:16:44.556 --> 01:16:46.297
You did this for us.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.473
- Yeah, I did.

01:16:48.516 --> 01:16:50.344
[Sighing]

01:16:50.388 --> 01:16:53.086
- Thank you.
Would you let us out now?

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:55.219
- That's not gonna work.
- No.

01:16:55.262 --> 01:16:57.221
No, not yet, not until
you work this out.

01:16:57.264 --> 01:16:59.440
But now that you're together,
you can do that.

01:16:59.484 --> 01:17:00.964
- Nikki, please!

01:17:01.007 --> 01:17:03.270
- You know what?
I--I know your chemistry.

01:17:03.314 --> 01:17:05.664
I know the way that
you look at each other,

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:08.406
so don't try to fake
anything, 'cause I'll know.

01:17:10.843 --> 01:17:12.584
Come on, Dana.

01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:18.503
Dana? Come on.

01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:26.729
- How did Nikki
get you in here?

01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:30.689
- She hit me on the head.
It still hurts.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.825
- That's the same
way James died.

01:17:42.483 --> 01:17:45.399
- [Dana]: Why are you trying
to get them back together?

01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:48.228
- Because it's what I have
to do to save the show.

01:17:48.272 --> 01:17:50.535
- But I thought you wanted
to be with Hunter.

01:17:50.578 --> 01:17:51.928
- No, that was
just a fling!

01:17:51.971 --> 01:17:53.669
What's important
is the show!

01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:57.020
- He didn't seem to look
at you weird or anything.

01:17:58.064 --> 01:17:59.457
- Weird?

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.373
- You know, the way you do
when you like somebody.

01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:04.854
- What are you getting at?

01:18:04.897 --> 01:18:06.856
- I don't know.

01:18:06.899 --> 01:18:10.337
I mean, did you
really have an affair?

01:18:10.381 --> 01:18:14.733
- I took the oath, didn't I?
What more do you want me to say?

01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:17.562
- OK. Fine.

01:18:43.588 --> 01:18:46.330
- [Hunter]: What do you think
she wants from us?

01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:50.943
- I don't know. It's hard
to say with a crazy person.

01:18:50.987 --> 01:18:53.293
My guess is she doesn't
want Mommy and Daddy

01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:54.425
to get a divorce.

01:18:54.468 --> 01:18:56.644
- Well, I don't
want that, either.

01:18:56.688 --> 01:18:57.863
- Yeah, well...

01:18:59.299 --> 01:19:01.649
- Seriously? You're
gonna stay mad at me?

01:19:03.216 --> 01:19:06.045
- Do you really think because
some fanatic abducted us,

01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:09.527
I'm just gonna forget that
you screwed around on me twice?

01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:11.268
- Tess, I didn't
cheat on you!

01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:12.835
- Explain the photo!

01:19:12.878 --> 01:19:14.140
- I can't!

01:19:14.184 --> 01:19:15.620
- Exactly!

01:19:15.663 --> 01:19:18.144
- But I'm not going to admit
to something I didn't do.

01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:19.798
If anyone cheated
here, it was you!

01:19:19.842 --> 01:19:21.191
- Excuse me?

01:19:21.234 --> 01:19:23.759
- You didn't tell me you were
gonna leave the show.

01:19:23.802 --> 01:19:25.238
- I was just
thinking about it!

01:19:25.282 --> 01:19:26.457
- Come on!

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.850
- No, OK,

01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:30.461
the only reason that
I even contemplated staying

01:19:30.504 --> 01:19:31.810
was because of you,

01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:34.944
and that is the same reason
that I have stayed

01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:36.467
for the last 7 years.

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:38.295
- There it is.

01:19:38.338 --> 01:19:40.688
You resent me
for making you stay

01:19:40.732 --> 01:19:43.474
at a job where
they pay you 7 figures,

01:19:43.517 --> 01:19:45.737
where everyone kisses your ass.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:47.870
I'm so sorry, Tess.

01:19:47.913 --> 01:19:49.480
- No, no, no. No.

01:19:49.523 --> 01:19:51.525
No, I'm sorry.

01:19:51.569 --> 01:19:53.266
I'm sorry that, yes,

01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:57.357
I want to be an actor instead
of a TV star like you.

01:19:57.401 --> 01:20:01.100
I'm sorry that I wanna play
a role that challenges me

01:20:01.144 --> 01:20:03.059
and do work that excites me.

01:20:03.102 --> 01:20:08.107
And I am sorry that our industry
is filled with sexism and ageism

01:20:08.151 --> 01:20:11.763
and I am typecast
more by the day.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:15.680
And I am so sorry
that I want this to end!

01:20:15.723 --> 01:20:17.334
[Slaps thigh]

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:22.948
- The show or us.

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:28.736
- [Whispering]: Both.

01:20:44.317 --> 01:20:47.059
[Siren wailing in distance]

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.584
[Cell phone buzzing]

01:21:02.074 --> 01:21:04.207
[Approaching footsteps]

01:21:20.788 --> 01:21:22.225
[Sighing]

01:21:22.268 --> 01:21:25.054
- So, I guess you guys didn't
work it out yet, huh?

01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:27.186
- You can't just
lock us up in here

01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:30.450
and expect us to forget
everything that's happened.

01:21:30.494 --> 01:21:32.931
It doesn't work
like that, Nikki.

01:21:35.107 --> 01:21:36.543
- OK, well, um,

01:21:36.587 --> 01:21:39.503
I might have some information
that will help, then.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:44.682
Tess, Hunter isn't lying

01:21:44.725 --> 01:21:48.294
when he said that
he wasn't cheating on you.

01:21:48.338 --> 01:21:50.731
- How do you know that?

01:21:52.995 --> 01:21:54.997
- It was me in the photo.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.086
- What?

01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:04.658
- You drugged me?

01:22:04.702 --> 01:22:06.965
- I gave you some of
Tess's sleeping pills,

01:22:07.009 --> 01:22:09.054
and then I snuck in
and took the photo.

01:22:09.098 --> 01:22:10.055
That's all it was.

01:22:10.099 --> 01:22:12.362
- Why would you do that?

01:22:12.405 --> 01:22:15.104
- I was trying to prove
something to my friends,

01:22:15.147 --> 01:22:17.280
and I told them that
we had an affair.

01:22:17.323 --> 01:22:20.109
And I didn't mean for it
to get out of control.

01:22:20.152 --> 01:22:23.373
I didn't mean for anyone
to see the photo, I promise.

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:26.637
But Charmaine must've just
leaked it to humiliate me.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.334
[Sniffling]

01:22:29.509 --> 01:22:31.468
I am so sorry.

01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:36.125
And I'm telling you now so
you guys can go back to the show

01:22:36.168 --> 01:22:38.823
even though it means
that I can't.

01:22:39.824 --> 01:22:41.869
[Crying]

01:22:41.913 --> 01:22:44.524
The show means everything to me.

01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:48.267
And I just need Kal
and Galanica back together.

01:22:48.311 --> 01:22:51.618
So, please, you guys
can be mad at me.

01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:56.188
Just please don't be mad
at each other anymore, OK?

01:22:56.232 --> 01:22:57.973
[Sighing]

01:22:59.191 --> 01:23:01.193
- [Whispering]:
I'm sorry.

01:23:01.237 --> 01:23:03.065
- [Whispering]:
It's OK.

01:23:03.108 --> 01:23:05.023
- [Whispering]:
So sorry.

01:23:05.067 --> 01:23:06.982
[Breathing shallowly]

01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:11.116
- [Dana]:
You're a liar!

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.988
You're a liar!

01:23:14.772 --> 01:23:16.034
- [Nikki]: Dana?

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:18.558
- You--you broke the oath?

01:23:18.602 --> 01:23:22.606
- No, no. Charmaine had me
backed into a corner.

01:23:22.649 --> 01:23:25.261
- Where is she?
- What?

01:23:25.304 --> 01:23:28.177
- The restaurant called,
and she didn't show up to open.

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.743
What did you
do to her, Nikki?

01:23:29.787 --> 01:23:30.744
- Nothing.

01:23:30.788 --> 01:23:31.832
[Scoffing]

01:23:31.876 --> 01:23:34.313
- How can I believe
anything you say?

01:23:34.357 --> 01:23:35.706
- Dana...

01:23:35.749 --> 01:23:36.794
- No! You're a liar.

01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:38.709
And I am so glad
you weren't really

01:23:38.752 --> 01:23:40.276
having an affair with Hunter,

01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:42.756
because he deserves
so much better than you.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.933
- Who? You?

01:23:45.977 --> 01:23:47.631
[Scoffing]

01:23:51.635 --> 01:23:53.767
[Doorbell buzzing]

01:23:55.117 --> 01:23:56.857
We'll work this out, OK?

01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:02.037
[Sighing]

01:24:08.608 --> 01:24:10.045
- Dana?
- Dana! Dana!

01:24:10.088 --> 01:24:11.307
[Pounding on door]

01:24:16.877 --> 01:24:18.531
- Yes?

01:24:18.575 --> 01:24:20.272
- Nikki Myers?
- Yeah.

01:24:20.316 --> 01:24:22.535
- Detective Paulson, NYPD.

01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:25.190
I was wondering if you
could answer a few questions

01:24:25.234 --> 01:24:26.670
about Tess Daniels.

01:24:26.713 --> 01:24:27.975
- Yeah! No, sure!

01:24:28.019 --> 01:24:31.153
- Well, do you think
we could chat inside?

01:24:31.196 --> 01:24:34.591
- Yes! Of course!
After you!

01:24:36.158 --> 01:24:37.550
- Dana, Nikki lied to you!

01:24:37.594 --> 01:24:40.162
Listen, I hear the way
that she bosses you around!

01:24:40.205 --> 01:24:41.815
She dragged you into this!

01:24:41.859 --> 01:24:44.035
- I don't want you to go
to jail for something

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:45.167
that's not your fault.

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:46.168
- No!

01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:47.517
- Why would I go to jail?

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.127
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:24:49.171 --> 01:24:51.216
- Not if you
let us out!

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.396
You know, we're gonna need
a new assistant on the show.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.268
- You mean me?

01:24:59.311 --> 01:25:01.792
- Yeah! I--I mean,
if you want the job.

01:25:01.835 --> 01:25:04.751
- I don't wanna be
your dumb assistant.

01:25:06.275 --> 01:25:08.799
- OK, well, maybe
something else, then.

01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:11.367
- So, when was the last time
you saw Tess?

01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:14.500
- Um, a couple of days ago.
I drove her home from set.

01:25:14.544 --> 01:25:16.937
- Mm-hmm. Drop her off
at her apartment?

01:25:16.981 --> 01:25:18.243
- Yeah! Yeah.

01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:20.767
- You haven't seen
or heard from her since?

01:25:20.811 --> 01:25:22.204
[Sighing]

01:25:22.247 --> 01:25:24.815
- No, sorry.
I wish I could be more help.

01:25:24.858 --> 01:25:26.425
- That's funny,

01:25:26.469 --> 01:25:29.602
'cause it went out on the news
that we were looking for her.

01:25:29.646 --> 01:25:31.691
Motel clerk called in
a tip this morning,

01:25:31.735 --> 01:25:33.258
said that she
was staying there,

01:25:33.302 --> 01:25:36.043
and, well, it was your credit
card that checked her in.

01:25:36.087 --> 01:25:38.307
- I was going to drop her
off at her apartment,

01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:40.483
but there was too many
photographers outside,

01:25:40.526 --> 01:25:41.919
so I drove her to the motel.

01:25:41.962 --> 01:25:43.834
- And that's the
last time you saw her.

01:25:43.877 --> 01:25:44.835
- Yes.

01:25:44.878 --> 01:25:46.532
[Laughing]

01:25:46.576 --> 01:25:49.056
- Well, we're also trying
to track down Dana Romley.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:50.232
- What for?

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:52.843
- Well, she uploaded
a photo to the Internet

01:25:52.886 --> 01:25:55.759
that, well, could have
something to do with this.

01:25:55.802 --> 01:25:58.544
We just had a few questions
for her, that's all.

01:25:58.588 --> 01:26:02.287
- No, sorry.
I--I haven't seen Dana, either.

01:26:02.331 --> 01:26:06.030
- I thought you were supposed
to be quitting the show.

01:26:06.073 --> 01:26:07.684
- I--I changed my mind.

01:26:07.727 --> 01:26:10.861
Nikki convinced me that
that was a mistake.

01:26:10.904 --> 01:26:12.950
- I don't think
that it is.

01:26:12.993 --> 01:26:14.778
I think you should quit.

01:26:21.654 --> 01:26:24.440
And I think you should go.

01:26:26.311 --> 01:26:28.357
- Is there anything else?

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.880
- No.

01:26:29.923 --> 01:26:31.925
No, you know what?
That's it.

01:26:31.969 --> 01:26:33.579
- OK!

01:26:33.623 --> 01:26:36.103
- Thank you very much
for your time. Thank you.

01:26:36.147 --> 01:26:38.062
- Oh no! No problem at all.

01:26:38.105 --> 01:26:40.107
[Sighing]

01:26:40.151 --> 01:26:43.241
Let me know if
you hear anything.

01:26:43.285 --> 01:26:45.461
- Yeah, we will.

01:26:58.387 --> 01:27:00.998
- I think you
should leave too.

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:02.521
- What?

01:27:02.565 --> 01:27:04.088
- Yeah.

01:27:04.131 --> 01:27:05.916
It's not gonna work
out between us.

01:27:05.959 --> 01:27:07.874
It's clear you
don't love me anymore.

01:27:07.918 --> 01:27:08.875
- Oh!

01:27:08.919 --> 01:27:11.487
I guess if that's
how you feel,

01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:13.489
then I guess you're right.

01:27:13.532 --> 01:27:15.360
Yeah, I should probably go.

01:27:20.365 --> 01:27:22.280
- Dana? What are you doing?

01:27:22.324 --> 01:27:24.021
- She wants to go,
she should go.

01:27:24.064 --> 01:27:26.284
- No, no, no!
Don't you dare!

01:27:26.328 --> 01:27:28.504
- I am done taking
orders from you.

01:27:28.547 --> 01:27:30.723
- I trusted you.

01:27:30.767 --> 01:27:33.422
I trusted you
with that photo.

01:27:33.465 --> 01:27:36.207
I know it was you and
not Charmaine who leaked it.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:38.253
- Whatever, she needs
to leave now.

01:27:41.821 --> 01:27:44.389
- [Hunter]: Watch it!
- Oh!

01:27:44.433 --> 01:27:46.086
[Screaming]

01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:58.403
- Hunter! Oh!

01:27:58.447 --> 01:28:00.231
[Hunter groaning]

01:28:06.716 --> 01:28:08.587
Hey! Look at me!

01:28:08.631 --> 01:28:12.112
Look at me. Hey!
You're OK! You're OK.

01:28:12.156 --> 01:28:13.810
Why did you do that?

01:28:13.853 --> 01:28:16.508
[Tess talking indistinctly]

01:28:16.552 --> 01:28:18.728
OK, just stay there.
Just stay there!

01:28:18.771 --> 01:28:20.643
No! No, don't!
Don't close your eyes!

01:28:20.686 --> 01:28:21.905
Don't! No!

01:28:21.948 --> 01:28:25.169
- I was-- I was gonna
let you go.

01:28:26.518 --> 01:28:28.128
[Tess sobbing]

01:28:28.172 --> 01:28:31.480
None of this would've happened
if you'd just listened to me.

01:28:37.399 --> 01:28:40.402
I've-- I've sacrificed
everything for you guys, and...

01:28:40.445 --> 01:28:42.317
[Sobbing]

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.537
...no one seems to care!

01:28:45.581 --> 01:28:47.017
- OK, Nikki, listen.

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:48.758
It's not too late.

01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:52.892
We have to get Hunter
to a doctor, OK?

01:28:54.372 --> 01:28:55.721
Nikki!

01:28:55.765 --> 01:28:58.550
- No.

01:28:58.594 --> 01:29:01.640
If you want the show to end...

01:29:02.728 --> 01:29:03.816
let's do it.

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.123
Let's end it right here.

01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:08.386
- What are you doing?

01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:10.910
- Giving Galanica
the end she deserves.

01:29:19.789 --> 01:29:21.660
[Both grunting]

01:29:30.843 --> 01:29:33.455
[Screaming, grunting]

01:29:53.736 --> 01:29:55.346
[Grunting]

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:58.218
- Are you with me, Kal?

01:29:58.262 --> 01:30:02.222
- For about 20 more seconds,

01:30:02.266 --> 01:30:05.704
unless he gets
what's in this vial.

01:30:05.748 --> 01:30:07.576
- What is that?

01:30:07.619 --> 01:30:11.014
- It is my
insurance policy,

01:30:11.057 --> 01:30:14.539
otherwise known as
a cellular antidote

01:30:14.583 --> 01:30:16.759
to the clone virus

01:30:16.802 --> 01:30:18.717
I put into him.

01:30:18.761 --> 01:30:21.372
- What's preventing me
from slicing your throat

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:23.374
and taking it right now?

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:27.291
- See, that's where
the cellular part comes in.

01:30:27.334 --> 01:30:29.772
It's cloned to my tissue.

01:30:29.815 --> 01:30:31.164
[Inmate giggling]

01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:34.037
So, if I die,
so does the antidote.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.821
[Inmates laughing]

01:30:36.822 --> 01:30:38.258
[Chuckling]

01:30:38.302 --> 01:30:40.043
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:30:40.086 --> 01:30:42.654
This show wouldn't even be on
if wasn't for me, OK?

01:30:42.698 --> 01:30:45.048
- So, you got
a decision to make.

01:30:45.091 --> 01:30:49.139
Kill me or save your boyfriend.

01:30:49.182 --> 01:30:51.489
[Vordo breathing heavily]

01:30:51.533 --> 01:30:53.360
[Sighing]

01:31:08.245 --> 01:31:09.899
[Knocking on door]

01:31:09.942 --> 01:31:11.117
- Come in.

01:31:11.161 --> 01:31:13.032
- Hey, what's up?

01:31:13.076 --> 01:31:15.557
- Have you seen
the wardrobe they put me in

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.993
for the slave scene?

01:31:17.036 --> 01:31:18.603
- No, what is it?

01:31:21.867 --> 01:31:23.739
[Chuckling]

01:31:29.266 --> 01:31:31.529
Wow!

01:31:31.573 --> 01:31:33.009
Yeah.

01:31:33.052 --> 01:31:35.098
Yeah, I'm gonna just...

01:31:35.141 --> 01:31:36.099
[Lock clicking]

01:31:36.142 --> 01:31:38.101
Hang on a second.

01:31:38.144 --> 01:31:41.365
I think that you
should be proud

01:31:41.408 --> 01:31:44.586
that they still wanna
see us naked at our age.

01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:45.761
- Ha, ha.

01:31:45.804 --> 01:31:48.546
- And I think
that we look good.

01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:51.941
I think we look
really, really good.

01:31:51.984 --> 01:31:53.899
- I gotta go back to set.

01:31:53.943 --> 01:31:57.250
- No, we have
a few minutes.
