00:01.012 --> 00:02.056
Previously...

00:02.421 --> 00:05.381
As if you know what's been going on.

00:05.401 --> 00:07.437
You haven't been home.
I don't know why.

00:08.357 --> 00:11.413
Dad refused to pay my Academy fees.
He hoped I'd run home.

00:11.429 --> 00:13.421
I failed all of them.

00:13.441 --> 00:17.425
You could retake your exams, but not
until we sort out your financials.

00:17.445 --> 00:20.365
This is about Grace launching herself
at me?

00:20.385 --> 00:23.401
She wasn't the one
doing the launching, Ethan.

00:23.417 --> 00:25.357
Someone's playing games.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.421
It seemed you were out to get Kat.

00:27.437 --> 00:29.385
You've done a lot worse.

00:29.405 --> 00:32.397
Everything's a lot easier when
you're around..

00:46.765 --> 00:49.802
Every Sunday, I used to play chess
with Grandpa Morrie.

00:49.822 --> 00:53.781
Between moves,
he'd tell me how he escaped Russia

00:53.798 --> 00:56.731
before World War II broke out.

00:57.757 --> 01:03.792
It does my head in that he was my
age when he left his family behind.

01:04.709 --> 01:08.725
To go out to another country
by himself,

01:08.744 --> 01:12.720
where he knew no-one,
for the chance to live.

01:14.695 --> 01:15.777
Sammy, don't worry.

01:16.696 --> 01:19.769
You're claiming independence
so you can receive Youth Allowance.

01:20.687 --> 01:22.706
That's not how
they're going to see it.

01:22.722 --> 01:24.730
It's like I'm divorcing my family.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.737
Sorry.

01:28.728 --> 01:30.741
Mum, where are you?

01:31.660 --> 01:35.710
Yeah, well,
we have a meeting with Miss Raine.

01:35.725 --> 01:37.674
When?

01:37.690 --> 01:39.673
So, Stepmum Volume 5 is pregnant.

01:39.694 --> 01:43.661
I'm pushing Violence as a baby name.
Has a nice ring to it.

01:43.677 --> 01:45.676
That bad, huh?

01:45.697 --> 01:49.616
Where's your dad?
I'll talk to him myself.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.396
No, the meeting didn't happen.

01:52.685 --> 01:55.622
My Grandpa Morrie died.

01:55.638 --> 01:58.632
Oh, Sammy. I'm so sorry.

02:00.655 --> 02:04.639
I have to go home. It's been
seven months since I've done that.

02:04.659 --> 02:07.588
Let us know if we can help.
Thanks.

02:17.623 --> 02:20.631
I come bearing Golden Steps Four.

02:21.546 --> 02:23.538
Seen it.

02:23.554 --> 02:25.565
Something you want?

02:25.585 --> 02:28.562
This is not still about
the other night?

02:28.578 --> 02:31.556
I was injecting the fun for you.

02:31.576 --> 02:36.569
For me?
You despise Kat and Tara, don't you?

02:36.589 --> 02:41.562
You should have told me if you
wanted to be part of their gang.

02:41.577 --> 02:43.550
Sorry, guys. Mishap.

02:43.570 --> 02:47.493
Everybody's on holiday except us
Prix de Fonteyn slaves.

02:47.513 --> 02:49.553
We've got class work today,
coaching tomorrow.

02:49.573 --> 02:52.490
Tara,
I've made an executive decision.

02:52.511 --> 02:55.503
You'll do Prelude, Les Sylphides,
not The Red Shoes.

02:55.523 --> 03:00.457
We've got the Academy's reputation
to think about.

03:01.494 --> 03:04.524
There I was,
tapping my little heart out,

03:04.540 --> 03:07.461
driving the customers inside,

03:07.482 --> 03:10.503
then this little kid
started kicking me in the shins.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.452
Did you kick him back?
Yes.

03:13.472 --> 03:16.494
Right. Well,
moving on from promotional work,

03:16.514 --> 03:19.487
I have an audition for you
which you're wrong for.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.435
You're too short, too inexperienced.

03:21.455 --> 03:24.492
But what do we say about rejection?
It's character-building.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.455
Yes.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.400
The Moulin Rouge!

03:28.419 --> 03:31.409
They audition in Sydney.
We grow longer legs here.

03:31.429 --> 03:35.432
I can't live in Paris.
My friends are here. You're right.

03:35.447 --> 03:38.426
What a horrific concept.

03:57.416 --> 04:01.412
I said, no running in the house.
Stop! Time out.

04:02.330 --> 04:04.377
Oh.
Hi, Aunty Sara.

04:04.397 --> 04:08.344
Time out.
Uncle David will get upset with you.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.330
If you want to run, go outside.

04:42.274 --> 04:46.237
Mum won't stop cooking.

04:46.257 --> 04:49.275
Sorry we didn't get to
see your teacher.

04:49.295 --> 04:54.208
We were on our way.
Mum, it's fine.

04:54.223 --> 04:55.261
How did it happen?

04:55.281 --> 04:59.253
He came home from his chess game
and fell asleep in his chair.

04:59.273 --> 05:02.287
And Dad's...
With the rabbi.

05:03.205 --> 05:08.253
Are you going to stay tonight?
He wants you to.

05:09.255 --> 05:11.195
Yeah.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.644
I always knew she was competitive.

05:18.164 --> 05:20.211
I just didn't think it would affect
our friendship.

05:20.231 --> 05:25.172
She's been better lately,
almost chilled...

05:25.188 --> 05:27.211
for Abigail.

05:27.231 --> 05:30.182
She was.
But with the Prix coming up...

05:30.202 --> 05:35.210
Makes me sound paranoid,
but it's like she's out to get me.

05:36.129 --> 05:39.118
Grace!
Come grace us with your presence.

05:44.139 --> 05:49.104
Hey, the other night was fun.
We should do it again soon.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.107
You, me, Grace.

05:53.083 --> 05:56.161
Grace plays with voodoo dolls
and you sleep with a teddy bear.

05:57.079 --> 06:00.124
I wouldn't be swapping
friendship bracelets.

06:00.144 --> 06:07.104
You don't have to be jealous of
her dancing. You've moved past that.

06:16.082 --> 06:19.067
Hey.
Hi.

06:19.082 --> 06:22.100
Hey, Kitty Kat. Sell many nuggets?

06:23.018 --> 06:25.089
I'm starting to think croissants
are more my thing.

06:28.074 --> 06:31.012
Daddy, it's me, calling to say

06:31.032 --> 06:35.016
congrats on the latest evil spawn
gestating in womb 5.

06:35.036 --> 06:37.079
I'm totally buying you guys
a present

06:37.997 --> 06:43.976
just as soon as you increase my
credit limit like we talked about.

06:43.992 --> 06:46.039
A girl's got expenses.

06:59.952 --> 07:03.949
Dad, I'm so sorry.
What was the meeting about today?

07:03.968 --> 07:07.939
It was nothing important.
I had some problems with my exams.

07:07.956 --> 07:09.001
Meaning?

07:10.989 --> 07:13.934
I failed them.

07:13.954 --> 07:16.916
I can't find
your grandfather's siddur.

07:16.936 --> 07:20.947
He brought it out with him
from Russia.

07:28.962 --> 07:33.898
Weird. I thought
these had more life in them.

07:33.915 --> 07:37.870
You get them free at the Royal.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.933
Nice little shoemaker.
Looks like a wizard.

07:40.852 --> 07:47.853
These are broken as well and I've
just sewn the ribbons on. Mine too.

07:49.904 --> 07:53.819
I guess Abigail's are OK.

07:58.809 --> 07:59.850
Mes filles!

07:59.866 --> 08:01.894
I'm April.

08:02.812 --> 08:06.826
Head shots and bios, excellent,
on the table.

08:06.846 --> 08:10.814
And pin these, I don't know,
somewhere.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.806
Could I possibly go later?

08:19.822 --> 08:23.838
Let me think. No.

08:24.751 --> 08:26.810
Just tell her they're broken.

08:37.811 --> 08:40.808
Guys, don't fall asleep
on the sidelines.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.761
What are you taking from this?

08:43.782 --> 08:46.751
Best port de bras
since Darcey Bussell?

08:46.767 --> 08:48.751
Abigail?

08:50.691 --> 08:52.754
It's supposed to be en pointe.
Yeah.

08:52.774 --> 08:56.734
Kind of glaring, isn't it?
Stop being lazy, Tara.

08:56.754 --> 09:02.741
If you've got blisters, you need to
lift that body weight off your feet.

09:07.662 --> 09:09.702
Sweetie, some people might tell you

09:09.721 --> 09:13.657
your feet are amazing,
but they're not that strong.

09:13.676 --> 09:16.224
If you dance in broken shoes,
you'll injure yourself.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.671
I don't know what happened. It's
your responsibility to be prepared.

09:19.687 --> 09:22.693
Kristen, you're up.

09:41.644 --> 09:44.609
Ladies! Your sole purpose in life

09:44.629 --> 09:47.643
is to get those legs up
as quickly as possible,

09:47.658 --> 09:50.568
then down as quickly as possible.

09:50.584 --> 09:52.588
Ow!

09:52.603 --> 09:54.631
Points for flexibility, though.

09:57.612 --> 10:03.567
You, Shorty.
Down the front so I can see you.

10:28.541 --> 10:30.553
Well, this is grim.

10:31.470 --> 10:36.508
Sammy, tell us your exciting news.
How is ballet school going?

10:36.523 --> 10:38.467
Fine, Aunty Sara.

10:38.487 --> 10:43.456
That's interesting. I don't call
failing your exams fine.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.509
You failed your exams?
They think I can resit them.

10:46.529 --> 10:49.476
You never failed
before you went to that place.

10:49.495 --> 10:52.500
Working 30 hours to pay
my own tuition probably does that.

10:52.520 --> 10:56.512
If you can't manage,
it's probably time to come home.

10:57.430 --> 10:59.505
I was going to bring this up
in our meeting.

11:00.423 --> 11:03.436
If I can claim
Independent Student status,

11:03.457 --> 11:05.412
I'll be eligible for
Youth Allowance.

11:05.432 --> 11:09.428
We can talk about this after the
funeral. No, I want to hear this.

11:09.443 --> 11:11.447
If what, Samuel?

11:14.445 --> 11:17.446
If a social worker decides
we have irreconcilable differences,

11:17.466 --> 11:21.425
I can pay my own way
and not ask you for anything.

11:21.446 --> 11:24.410
You don't want to be
part of the family.

11:24.427 --> 11:26.370
No, that's not it.

11:32.393 --> 11:35.411
Yeah, I can make them last
a little longer.

11:36.329 --> 11:41.398
I know. It's a lot of money.
Sorry for asking. Bye.

11:44.391 --> 11:46.350
Why are you sitting here?

11:46.367 --> 11:49.332
We were going to hang out.

11:49.353 --> 11:53.344
All of my pointe shoes are broken.
All of Grace's are broken.

11:53.363 --> 11:56.317
I want to believe you've changed,
but...

11:56.337 --> 12:00.293
Why would I have broken
your pointe shoes?

12:00.313 --> 12:04.307
Because I'm deeply threatened by
that bland solo you're doing?

12:04.328 --> 12:08.263
I can't believe how much of your crap
I put up with.

12:08.283 --> 12:11.256
What sort of a pathetic freak
are you?

12:11.276 --> 12:15.288
Grace was your only friend,
now you've pushed her away.

12:15.303 --> 12:17.287
I didn't touch them.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.286
Who else would?

12:19.302 --> 12:22.229
Grace would.

12:22.244 --> 12:24.228
You wouldn't believe me, would you?

12:24.248 --> 12:26.240
Grace is the least competitive person
here,

12:26.260 --> 12:28.311
and she's hardly going to
break her own shoes.

12:29.225 --> 12:31.288
So no, I don't believe you.

12:56.218 --> 12:58.189
Who wants to go again?

12:58.205 --> 13:01.171
Yep!

13:01.188 --> 13:05.182
Oh! You were joking. Got it, got it.

13:05.202 --> 13:11.185
OK. Get ready for some
happy-slash-sad news.

13:11.205 --> 13:16.151
If I call your number, please
come back tomorrow for an interview.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.148
The rest of you,
you're probably really lovely,

13:19.168 --> 13:22.169
but you will not come to Paris
with us.

13:22.185 --> 13:25.115
Number 12.

13:25.130 --> 13:27.127
Number 6.

13:27.143 --> 13:29.099
Legs 11.

13:30.124 --> 13:32.075
And...

13:32.091 --> 13:34.099
Shorty 14.

13:34.116 --> 13:36.099
Yes!

13:36.115 --> 13:39.084
Sorry.

13:39.101 --> 13:41.088
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

13:52.031 --> 13:56.035
Cheese, gherkin and strawberry jam,
if I recall.

13:56.052 --> 13:59.017
I haven't had that in ages.

14:01.013 --> 14:02.102
Why the suit?

14:03.020 --> 14:08.030
I'm going to the funeral home
to sit Shemira with Dad.

14:08.045 --> 14:10.025
Can I come?

14:38.930 --> 14:42.996
With the Academy,
I'm rejecting medicine, not you.

14:45.008 --> 14:48.971
Medicine is the secure option.

14:48.988 --> 14:52.940
You take being secure for granted.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.970
I know.

15:02.949 --> 15:07.866
The night you were born,
I didn't sleep at all.

15:07.886 --> 15:11.882
I stayed awake making lists
of all the things I needed to do.

15:11.902 --> 15:17.904
New car with airbags,
health insurance, a bigger house,

15:17.919 --> 15:19.912
because there was you.

15:25.847 --> 15:29.822
It's my job to protect you, Sammy.

15:40.874 --> 15:45.848
That's me one and you nil,
and I'm still only in second gear.

15:45.867 --> 15:51.795
Let's hug it out and make up.
I miss you.

15:51.810 --> 15:54.803
Grace, you're whack.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.835
I'm rising above.

15:56.851 --> 15:58.847
Enjoy round two.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.785
Hey, what are you doing here?

16:04.805 --> 16:08.789
Did you know that the cancan started
as a party dance

16:08.808 --> 16:10.800
popular among
the French working class?

16:10.816 --> 16:12.816
You're researching.

16:13.731 --> 16:15.797
You must really want this, huh?

16:15.814 --> 16:18.780
Ethan, it's awful.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.793
I've got this personality test/
interview.

16:22.710 --> 16:26.770
Is this where I tell you
to be yourself? No. Myself is bad.

16:26.790 --> 16:33.754
That's where they find out I'm
a serial failure and a dance fraud.

17:01.174 --> 17:05.121
That was fantastic.
You even wore appropriate footwear.

17:05.136 --> 17:07.145
Abigail, may I speak with you?

17:08.151 --> 17:11.127
Outside?

17:11.146 --> 17:15.179
I need you to explain
why you felt the need

17:16.097 --> 17:20.167
to target and victimise
two of your fellow students.

17:21.087 --> 17:24.136
You should talk to your goddaughter
about that, Miss Raine.

17:24.155 --> 17:28.151
You already did. Grace is worried
about you, and I have to agree.

17:28.769 --> 17:31.092
I've booked an appointment
with your therapist again.

17:31.112 --> 17:34.074
I thought you'd moved on
from first year,

17:34.094 --> 17:37.127
but this jealousy is an issue
that needs to be resolved.

17:38.045 --> 17:42.037
I want you to apologise to Grace
and Tara. Do I have a choice?

17:42.056 --> 17:44.112
Apologise
and compete in the Prix de Fonteyn

17:45.026 --> 17:47.086
or don't apologise and don't compete.

17:53.013 --> 17:59.074
At the Moulin, you do two shows a
night, nearly every day of the year.

17:59.994 --> 18:03.074
It's tough.
It's not as glamorous as you think.

18:03.992 --> 18:06.053
Why do you think
you would want to move

18:06.072 --> 18:09.061
to the other side of the world
to do that?

18:09.979 --> 18:15.017
Well, last week, I kissed
my best friend's ex-boyfriend,

18:15.036 --> 18:23.006
so it kind of seems like
the right time to get away.

18:23.027 --> 18:30.016
But when I read about
the Moulin Rouge,

18:30.929 --> 18:31.998
it felt like me.

18:32.015 --> 18:34.997
It's cheeky and fun,

18:35.914 --> 18:39.943
and for 100 years,
people have been going there

18:39.962 --> 18:45.953
to lose themselves,
to be someone else for a night.

18:45.973 --> 18:49.964
And I think that
I can be good at this.

18:49.980 --> 18:53.963
I kind of never really think that.

20:25.048 --> 20:27.192
You know your grandfather loved you.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.180
I loved him too.

20:47.147 --> 20:51.134
I've been told I have to apologise.

20:51.154 --> 20:56.107
Actually, I AM sorry,
for hiding your costume last year

20:56.127 --> 21:00.106
and for the way I acted
when we first met.

21:00.126 --> 21:04.141
Hey, roomie. I arrive eager
and ready to carry your boxes.

21:04.161 --> 21:11.154
It doesn't matter anymore. I don't
think we were meant to be roommates.

21:14.110 --> 21:17.071
So, where's my apology?

21:18.092 --> 21:20.089
She'll work you out.

21:25.110 --> 21:28.115
Hey. You're back.

21:28.135 --> 21:33.073
How was the rest of it?
It was OK.

21:33.088 --> 21:36.109
I can't get Youth Allowance.

21:37.028 --> 21:41.094
I can get it, I just don't want to
not be part of my family.

21:42.013 --> 21:46.036
Right on cue, here's Miss Raine
to talk about my fees.

21:46.056 --> 21:50.047
Congratulations, Samuel. It's
a sad day, but that must be a relief.

21:50.067 --> 21:53.021
Sorry?
Your father didn't tell you?

21:53.041 --> 21:59.004
He was just in my office handing over
a cheque for next semester.

22:00.987 --> 22:04.056
Don't worry, I'm just visiting.
So, I have news.

22:04.975 --> 22:10.961
I am moving to Paris to be a dancer
in the Moulin Rouge.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.040
Wow. That's...
Amazing?

22:12.953 --> 22:14.011
I guess.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.945
Dad!

22:37.978 --> 22:40.891
I'll always remember Grandpa Morrie
saying

22:40.912 --> 22:44.963
that the only reward for a good life
is a good life.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.910
That it's your duty to work hard,
give back,

22:48.929 --> 22:52.602
right whatever wrongs you can

22:52.603 --> 22:55.894
and then, make it count.

22:56.305 --> 23:02.678
