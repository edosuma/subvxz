00:01.030 --> 00:03.590
I want to show you
where Jesse Wells is buried.

00:03.750 --> 00:05.150
Danny, this is a little girl.

00:05.310 --> 00:08.070
You are as useless as your father.

00:08.230 --> 00:09.510
Ray has to go.

00:11.110 --> 00:14.310
<i>Stuart took Nico to the States.</i>

00:14.470 --> 00:15.790
<i>I love Mark.</i>

00:15.950 --> 00:17.830
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
And get clean.

00:17.990 --> 00:19.150
Hey!

00:19.310 --> 00:21.510
It's the burglar my dad
described right down

00:21.670 --> 00:23.990
<i>to the backpack he was
wearing with the smiley face on it.</i>

00:24.150 --> 00:26.510
- I still think I saw him.
- You think Jesse's still alive?

00:26.670 --> 00:29.870
Or this is a massive hoax?
I think Jakob Marosi's behind this.

00:30.030 --> 00:30.870
Three acts.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.510
Act one: target.
Act two: pain. Act three: kill.

- Hey.
- Hey.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.990
Where are you up to?

03:36.230 --> 03:38.310
<i>Er... four down, one to go.</i>

03:41.510 --> 03:42.710
Jesse's?

03:48.630 --> 03:49.590
Yeah.

03:55.150 --> 03:57.230
Do you want me to come in with you?

03:59.990 --> 04:01.670
Yeah, OK. Sure.

04:32.190 --> 04:34.430
- Is that...?
- That's Jesse.

04:45.590 --> 04:48.670
Danny, if this is what we think it is...

04:51.950 --> 04:53.950
There are three tapes for him.

04:54.110 --> 04:57.150
Then Jesse's dead and Marosi
was telling the truth all along.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.190
And if that is the case,

05:02.350 --> 05:04.910
then how do we explain
his DNA turning up?

05:05.070 --> 05:07.990
We can't. There's no explanation.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.550
A hoax? Someone screwing with us?

05:12.350 --> 05:14.790
These tapes were dropped off
anonymously.

05:14.950 --> 05:16.070
This is...

05:19.950 --> 05:21.550
It makes no sense.

05:22.710 --> 05:24.790
And where's Jesse's body?

05:24.950 --> 05:26.270
Huh?

05:26.430 --> 05:28.790
Maybe the next two tapes will tell us.

06:18.150 --> 06:19.470
Try the last one.

06:47.430 --> 06:48.990
He didn't kill him.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.190
He was going to.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.310
But he didn't get him.

07:00.070 --> 07:01.510
He didn't get him.

07:04.710 --> 07:07.590
So, what can I do for you?

07:08.430 --> 07:09.790
We found your tapes.

07:12.870 --> 07:15.270
We watched them,
for the children you murdered.

07:16.630 --> 07:18.710
- Did you enjoy them?
- There's a final one.

07:19.550 --> 07:22.950
It starts with Jesse. He's a target,
you filmed him in the park.

07:23.670 --> 07:26.870
But the next two tapes,
"pain" and "kill"...

07:27.630 --> 07:28.670
they're blank.

07:31.710 --> 07:34.110
The timecode on the first tape
proves that you were there

07:34.270 --> 07:35.630
the day that Jesse went missing.

07:35.790 --> 07:38.430
But the tapes, that meticulous ritual

07:38.590 --> 07:40.590
that you developed
for the other murders,

07:40.750 --> 07:42.510
suggests that you didn't kill him.

07:48.590 --> 07:49.710
OK.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.670
I'll tell you who else was there,

07:53.350 --> 07:55.150
under one condition.

07:58.510 --> 08:02.510
I want to watch the tape...
the Jesse tape.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.390
- No fucking way!
- We have to.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.310
It's sick. He's toying with us!

08:07.470 --> 08:08.470
Danny, think clearly.

08:08.630 --> 08:11.270
It's one tape
of Jesse in the park, that's it.

08:11.430 --> 08:13.830
We show him that,
he'll talk, tell us something vital.

08:13.990 --> 08:16.310
Oh, really?
And then what happens if he doesn't?

08:16.470 --> 08:18.950
We show it to him, we give him
something to wank over,

08:19.110 --> 08:21.830
then he smiles his sick
little... smile and says,

08:21.990 --> 08:23.830
"Oh, yeah. Thanks, thanks for that."

08:23.990 --> 08:26.510
- It's a risk we have to take.
- Screw him. Screw him, Ally.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.750
I'm not doing it.

08:28.910 --> 08:32.350
Then we've got nothing.
We're no further forward than we were.

08:38.390 --> 08:41.110
Fine, show it to him.
Give the sick bastard what he wants.

09:07.390 --> 09:09.390
The one that got away.

09:12.830 --> 09:16.190
The one film I never finished.

09:21.790 --> 09:23.670
So what happened, Marosi?

09:27.390 --> 09:28.870
Come on, you've seen your video.

09:29.030 --> 09:31.310
Tell us what you know about that day.

09:34.990 --> 09:37.750
He would have been the next one.

09:38.830 --> 09:41.190
He would, without question.

09:41.950 --> 09:46.750
I liked him. I wanted him.
And he was a target.

09:48.270 --> 09:51.750
But then...
when I went to lure him in...

09:55.790 --> 09:57.350
someone arrived.

09:59.110 --> 10:00.470
Someone he knew.

10:01.550 --> 10:02.950
And that was that.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.430
As far as I know,

10:06.070 --> 10:10.950
that person was the last person
who "see" Jesse alive.

10:12.830 --> 10:14.830
Who was that person?

10:18.670 --> 10:19.910
His father.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.550
Herbal, very good.

10:31.510 --> 10:32.870
Oh, hello.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.550
Table for two?

10:36.070 --> 10:38.430
Actually, Alan,
can we have a word in private?

10:38.590 --> 10:41.030
Yeah, sure. Why, what is it?
What's happened?

10:41.190 --> 10:43.670
We just need you to come
to the station with us.

10:43.830 --> 10:44.910
Why?

10:47.030 --> 10:48.950
It concerns the disappearance of Jesse.

10:49.110 --> 10:50.990
We just need to ask you
some questions.

10:51.870 --> 10:53.990
What questions? What's this, Danny?

10:56.710 --> 10:58.190
In the light of new information,

10:58.350 --> 11:00.790
we'd like to question you
about the disappearance of your son.

11:00.950 --> 11:02.830
- New information?
- From Jakob Marosi.

11:10.990 --> 11:14.390
Oh, you're arresting me?
Like father, like son!

11:14.550 --> 11:16.110
We're not arresting you, Alan.

11:16.270 --> 11:19.470
What new information
after all these years?

11:19.630 --> 11:22.070
Hm? Ah, Jesus...

11:22.230 --> 11:26.190
I'm... I'm not coming in.
Sorry, no. I'm not doing it.

11:26.350 --> 11:28.910
- Mr Wells, we just want to...
- Excuse me!

11:29.070 --> 11:31.430
I'm not doing it. All right?

11:31.590 --> 11:33.750
But you arrest me, go on.
You do it.

11:34.630 --> 11:36.470
Because that's the only way I'm coming in

11:36.630 --> 11:39.430
to discuss the disappearance of my son

11:39.590 --> 11:42.910
based on the information
of Jakob bloody Marosi!

11:43.070 --> 11:44.230
- Alan...
- Come on, come on!

11:44.390 --> 11:46.710
- Alan...
- You arrest me. Come on!

11:47.390 --> 11:48.510
Arrest me!

11:51.710 --> 11:53.190
Alan Wells, I am arresting you

11:53.350 --> 11:56.070
on suspicion
of the murder of Jesse Wells.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.870
Can you open your mouth,
please, sir?

12:26.030 --> 12:27.230
Thank you.

12:29.190 --> 12:30.310
That's fine.

12:56.990 --> 12:59.070
- <i>Mummy!</i>
- Hey!

12:59.230 --> 13:02.150
- <i>Are you OK?</i>
- Good. How are you?

13:02.310 --> 13:05.110
- <i>Are you working?</i>
- No, I'm not at work.

13:05.270 --> 13:07.990
I'm... helping a friend.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.030
<i>So as you know,</i>

13:12.350 --> 13:14.310
I can't account for myself.

13:14.470 --> 13:18.270
I have no alibi, no corroboration.

13:19.790 --> 13:23.910
I was at home in my garden,
my own garden, enjoying myself.

13:27.310 --> 13:30.670
The last moments of pleasure
before everything was ripped away.

13:33.390 --> 13:37.430
And... the boys were out playing

13:37.590 --> 13:41.030
and I didn't want Jesse to go with Mark.

13:41.750 --> 13:45.710
I wanted him to stay home,
but he wanted to go.

13:47.750 --> 13:51.230
And then...
Julie went out to the shops...

13:52.310 --> 13:54.470
and... she went with her friend

13:54.630 --> 13:57.150
and I stayed at home
in my own garden,

13:57.310 --> 14:01.030
and I just cut the hedges and I dug up
a bit and I tidied the borders.

14:01.190 --> 14:03.790
And at no time did you leave
the house or the garden?

14:03.950 --> 14:08.030
No, because...
because what would be the motive?

14:08.710 --> 14:11.510
Danny,
have you ever asked yourself that?

14:12.070 --> 14:14.870
Why would I?
What would be the logic?

14:17.150 --> 14:20.110
Why would I go out and have...

14:20.790 --> 14:23.950
Let's face it,
I would kill the son I love?

14:28.590 --> 14:29.710
Would you?

14:29.870 --> 14:33.550
No, and neither would most
people because most normal people...

14:33.710 --> 14:37.030
And sadly, that's what I am.
I'm normal, an unexceptional man.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.590
Would not kill the child they loved.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.710
In fact, the only thing
that makes me exceptional

14:43.870 --> 14:46.030
is having their child abducted.

14:47.230 --> 14:50.350
People used to point at me,
they used to pity me.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.590
And they said, "Look, that's him.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.990
That's... That's the bloke
that had his kid taken.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.270
Do you think he was involved?"

15:04.590 --> 15:08.630
And then your dad dragged me in,
and it was just fuel to the flames.

15:09.990 --> 15:13.830
"It has to be the father.
Well, it's always the father."

15:19.790 --> 15:23.470
Have you seriously asked yourself
the question, why?

15:26.070 --> 15:27.630
Why would I?

15:34.150 --> 15:35.230
Dad.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.110
Dad. What have they done?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.270
- Got nothing to say.
- What were they asking you?

15:40.430 --> 15:42.390
- Speak to your friend.
- What were they asking you?

15:42.550 --> 15:44.790
- It's all crap! I'm going home.
- Let me drive you.

15:44.950 --> 15:46.150
- No, I need a walk.
- Dad, please.

15:46.310 --> 15:48.390
You know what? Maybe it is my fault.

15:48.550 --> 15:50.430
I should never have left you
in charge of him.

15:52.230 --> 15:54.030
Why didn't I just keep him home?

15:58.110 --> 15:59.550
Mark!

16:06.790 --> 16:08.430
- I tried...
- This is bullshit.

16:08.590 --> 16:10.310
- No...
- Jakob Marosi.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.270
Marosi didn't kill him.
I'm more sure of that.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.830
- You think my dad did?
- Maybe nobody did. That's what...

16:14.990 --> 16:17.710
You should have waited for me
before you interviewed him.

16:17.870 --> 16:20.110
Why didn't you wait?
Danny, you should have waited for me!

16:22.470 --> 16:26.630
Look, the Marosi tapes indicate
that Jesse is still alive.

16:27.790 --> 16:29.350
I'm trying to find him for you.

16:30.350 --> 16:31.470
All right.

16:36.910 --> 16:40.070
<i>Danny, I can't handle it. He's naked.</i>

16:40.230 --> 16:42.030
<i>He's got an erection!</i>

16:47.390 --> 16:48.310
Take me back.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.070
- Take me...
- What are you doing? Stop that!

16:54.230 --> 16:55.510
She doesn't want you!

16:55.670 --> 16:57.830
You get that? She doesn't want you!

17:02.510 --> 17:04.069
I don't want you.

17:05.710 --> 17:06.910
Too bad.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.230
I'm all you've got.

17:14.150 --> 17:15.950
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:20.950 --> 17:22.109
You told him yet?

17:23.829 --> 17:24.829
Mark?

17:26.630 --> 17:29.030
- You know, the love thing?
- Sorry.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.910
- No, not yet.
- Hm.

17:35.710 --> 17:37.430
You think I should do it like the films

17:37.590 --> 17:39.870
and run through the streets
and declare it there and then?

17:40.030 --> 17:42.190
If only life was like the movies.

17:42.350 --> 17:43.430
Yours is.

17:44.550 --> 17:46.950
Yeah, I know. That's true.

17:47.110 --> 17:48.590
Cool soundtrack, too.

17:49.230 --> 17:50.310
See ya.

18:03.830 --> 18:04.710
Hi.

18:06.310 --> 18:07.510
Just visiting?

18:09.350 --> 18:12.790
She's had him for no time at all
and she can't cope?

18:12.950 --> 18:14.070
Jen...

18:14.230 --> 18:16.910
Danny,
we were just getting to a good place.

18:18.070 --> 18:21.230
I just walked through the door
with a smile on my face.

18:21.390 --> 18:22.510
Sun shining...

18:23.430 --> 18:25.710
I wanted to take us
all out for dinner.

18:26.710 --> 18:29.430
This is how I want our lives to be.

18:31.070 --> 18:32.550
We've had him for years.

18:33.230 --> 18:36.550
I'm sorry
if that makes me sound like a bitch.

18:39.350 --> 18:40.790
I can't do this anymore.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.110
Jen... Jen, listen to me.

19:08.910 --> 19:10.550
Yeah, Ken?

19:10.710 --> 19:12.670
Yeah, bit of a strange one.

19:12.830 --> 19:15.350
- The lab spotted an anomaly.
- <i>OK.</i>

19:15.510 --> 19:18.390
Yeah, and it's...
well, it's pretty significant.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.150
Significant like...

19:20.310 --> 19:22.990
<i>Well, I did a cross-match between Alan</i>

19:23.150 --> 19:26.230
and Jesse Wells' DNA
and they don't match.

19:27.110 --> 19:28.550
They don't match? As in...

19:28.710 --> 19:30.870
Alan Wells is not Jesse's father.

19:33.150 --> 19:34.670
Is he my father?

19:38.350 --> 19:41.110
Let's just get a DNA test done on that.

19:41.270 --> 19:43.790
I'm going to erm... make some calls,

19:43.950 --> 19:45.710
see if we can get you in
a bit quicker.

19:48.150 --> 19:49.550
I don't get it.

19:55.190 --> 19:57.190
I mean, if he isn't my dad's...

20:02.070 --> 20:03.590
This could be a fuck-up.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.470
Hm...

20:06.870 --> 20:11.030
Maybe the DNA sample
isn't actually Jesse.

20:11.190 --> 20:13.030
Yeah, I... I thought that, too.

20:13.190 --> 20:16.870
But I've been round the streets
on this one. I just...

20:19.950 --> 20:21.390
Mark, you know as well as I do

20:22.270 --> 20:26.310
the simplest explanation
is just usually the right one.

20:32.670 --> 20:33.990
Let's go talk to your mum.

20:34.910 --> 20:37.550
- You gonna drag her in?
- No, come on.

20:37.710 --> 20:39.670
Just me and you,
or just you if you like.

20:39.830 --> 20:44.230
We'll just go to her,
talk with her, tell her what we know.

20:46.350 --> 20:47.630
Ask her.

20:50.230 --> 20:51.830
Danny, you don't think...

20:55.630 --> 20:58.390
my dad knew and he did something stupid?

21:00.470 --> 21:02.630
Let's just go and talk to your mum.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.310
- Hi, Mum.
- Hey.

21:19.230 --> 21:21.230
<i>Well, there's no point
in my denying it, is there?</i>

21:21.790 --> 21:24.390
If the science says he's not Alan's,
then he's not Alan's.

21:24.550 --> 21:25.910
Did you know?

21:27.630 --> 21:30.710
They say a woman knows.
I didn't. Not for definite.

21:30.870 --> 21:33.310
- Mum, am I his? Am I Dad's?
- Yes.

21:33.470 --> 21:36.870
- Am I? Cause I can take a test.
- Yes!

21:37.030 --> 21:39.070
God, this all happened
long after you were born.

21:39.230 --> 21:40.190
Who was it?

21:44.190 --> 21:47.070
- A friend.
- More specifically, Mum.

21:48.710 --> 21:50.510
You might remember him.

21:51.390 --> 21:54.550
He used to drive you to school
with his two little girls before they...

21:56.630 --> 21:59.350
They died in a car crash.
His name was Frank Lipton.

22:02.270 --> 22:03.870
He lived on my street.

22:04.630 --> 22:07.110
Frank Lipton. How long did it last?

22:07.270 --> 22:10.670
No time.
It was... after his girls died,

22:10.830 --> 22:13.230
it was compassion that spilled...

22:13.390 --> 22:14.750
Where's Frank now?

22:14.910 --> 22:16.230
No idea. He moved away.

22:16.390 --> 22:18.310
After Jesse went missing?

22:18.470 --> 22:19.870
No, much later.

22:20.230 --> 22:23.790
- When?
- A year, maybe... two.

22:23.950 --> 22:26.950
But he was there in the weeks after.
He helped with the search.

22:27.110 --> 22:28.470
Why did he leave?

22:29.150 --> 22:31.270
New job, new town.

22:32.470 --> 22:35.350
- Did you stay in contact with him?
- No. We were long over.

22:35.510 --> 22:37.750
He was just an old friend
who'd moved away.

22:39.110 --> 22:41.270
I made a decision.

22:41.430 --> 22:44.350
Your dad was Jesse's dad
and that was the way I wanted it.

22:44.510 --> 22:46.270
He deserves to know. Dad.

22:46.430 --> 22:49.030
Why does he?
So you can break his heart?

22:49.430 --> 22:51.910
What is a dad, anyway, hm?

22:52.070 --> 22:54.630
He is the man who is there every day,
the one that loves you,

22:54.790 --> 22:56.230
and that was Alan.

23:00.270 --> 23:01.910
We need to find Frank Lipton.

23:29.510 --> 23:31.710
That's my friend just there. Thanks.

23:32.710 --> 23:33.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:34.150 --> 23:36.270
- How are you?
- Yeah, OK.

23:36.430 --> 23:38.710
Great. I'm starving.

23:39.470 --> 23:40.790
I could eat a scabby dog.

23:41.510 --> 23:43.590
Is it a dog or is it a horse?
Scabby horse?

23:43.750 --> 23:45.390
I don't know the expression.

23:48.230 --> 23:49.950
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

23:56.110 --> 23:57.390
I love you.

23:58.310 --> 23:59.990
I've always loved you.

24:02.110 --> 24:04.310
And I know I should probably
just keep my mouth shut

24:04.470 --> 24:06.630
and let things be,
but I can't do that.

24:07.510 --> 24:11.190
I can't do that because I really
feel like we're meant to be.

24:12.030 --> 24:14.750
You know, because we were brought
together again

24:14.910 --> 24:16.430
with all this Jesse stuff.

24:16.590 --> 24:18.590
It's brought us back together.

24:19.590 --> 24:21.430
And I've never forgotten you.

24:22.390 --> 24:25.630
And I know we were kids, but...

24:27.950 --> 24:29.990
a feeling is a feeling and...

24:30.670 --> 24:33.670
I'm not a kid
and I still have that feeling.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.870
And I know it's a mess because...

24:38.110 --> 24:41.510
I'm married
and I don't love him and I've got Nico,

24:41.670 --> 24:44.990
but that doesn't mean
we can't sort the mess

24:45.390 --> 24:47.190
and make it so that we're happy.

24:49.550 --> 24:52.110
We could be really happy, I think.

24:53.430 --> 24:54.270
Yeah.

24:55.070 --> 24:57.990
I'm so sorry, I've got an itchy nose
and it's the worst time.

25:04.630 --> 25:07.070
So... so... so... go on.

25:07.230 --> 25:10.350
This is when you... just...
tell me you feel the same

25:10.510 --> 25:13.510
and strings play
and we kiss and credits roll.

25:18.590 --> 25:19.750
Whoa.

25:22.670 --> 25:23.750
"Whoa."

25:23.910 --> 25:27.390
Well, it's not awful.
I mean, it's not... it's not rejection.

25:32.790 --> 25:36.230
Mark, please don't answer that.
Please. We're having a moment...

25:36.390 --> 25:40.190
Pru, it's Danny. I...

25:40.350 --> 25:42.630
I think we're really close to something.

25:42.790 --> 25:44.830
I'm really... I've got to take this.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.630
Hey, Danny.
I'm just in the middle of something.

25:54.790 --> 25:55.870
Can I call you back?

25:56.030 --> 25:58.790
<i>No. You need to meet me at the station.
Quick as you can.</i>

25:59.590 --> 26:02.150
- It's important.
- OK, OK.

26:05.270 --> 26:06.230
That was quick.

26:06.390 --> 26:09.310
Erm... I need to go and meet Danny.

26:09.990 --> 26:10.870
Mark...

26:13.150 --> 26:14.190
Pru...

26:17.030 --> 26:22.030
I really want to talk about this.
I want to talk about it properly.

26:22.510 --> 26:23.590
But?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.190
You said it with a "but",

26:28.350 --> 26:31.270
with caveats,
and I'm just so sick of caveats.

26:33.790 --> 26:37.590
I need clarity.
I've got to feel something real.

26:40.750 --> 26:43.550
- But go if you have to.
- Pru, I'm so sorry.

26:52.430 --> 26:56.390
Two years after Jesse goes missing
Frank Lipton falls off the radar.

26:56.550 --> 26:59.350
No tax records,
no National Insurance, <i>nada.</i>

26:59.510 --> 27:00.910
I mean complete disappearing act.

27:01.070 --> 27:03.270
So I'm, like, "All right,
so he's left the country."

27:03.430 --> 27:05.070
But then I found this.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.710
When he sold his house he gave
his solicitor a forwarding address.

27:08.870 --> 27:10.870
It's a cottage his mother left him.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.430
- A cottage? Where is it?
- Middle of nowhere.

27:15.310 --> 27:18.390
Farming country.
It's a little town called Fellington,

27:18.550 --> 27:19.830
60 miles from here.

27:20.390 --> 27:24.230
So he moves to a remote house,
he tries to make himself invisible.

27:24.390 --> 27:25.670
Mm-hm.

27:26.430 --> 27:28.470
Why would he do that?

27:28.630 --> 27:30.270
Fancy some country air?

27:38.030 --> 27:40.830
I don't know
what department he's in, erm...

27:41.950 --> 27:42.910
Sorry, one sec.

27:43.750 --> 27:46.110
Hi. Ally, is it?

27:46.270 --> 27:49.430
- Yeah.
- Hi. I'm Pru, friend of Danny's.

27:49.590 --> 27:52.630
- Yes. Are you here to...
- I'm looking for Mark.

27:53.910 --> 27:56.390
- He's come to see Danny.
- OK, cool. I'll take you up.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.510
Er... sorry, just a second. Yes?

28:03.670 --> 28:06.550
I've been thinking.
You know, about the night we...

28:08.150 --> 28:09.310
Yes?

28:10.110 --> 28:12.590
Well, it was all a bit
"cut to the chase", you know?

28:12.750 --> 28:16.670
And I'd love to take you out,
talk, have dinner.

28:16.830 --> 28:18.590
- Karl, this really isn't...
- Let me tell you,

28:18.750 --> 28:21.470
that smile you've got, it's like
the best smile in the whole world.

28:22.430 --> 28:23.830
Yeah, that one.

28:23.990 --> 28:25.350
And there it is again.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.910
- Can we talk about this later?
- I tell you what,

28:29.070 --> 28:31.710
I'll text you a time and a venue.

28:31.870 --> 28:34.390
- You just reply yes or no.
- OK.

28:34.550 --> 28:36.550
- Sorry.
- An admirer?

28:36.710 --> 28:38.070
It's just Karl.

28:50.190 --> 28:51.390
I'm so, so sorry.

28:51.550 --> 28:53.270
I tried calling, but you must have left.

28:53.430 --> 28:56.350
It's Mark, he's been up all night.
Temperature and vomiting.

28:56.510 --> 28:59.390
- We're going to keep him home today.
- All right. I'm sorry.

28:59.550 --> 29:02.430
Oh, he'll be fine. I just don't like
sending him in in this kind of state.

29:02.590 --> 29:03.550
Sure, sure.

29:03.710 --> 29:05.670
- Hope Mark's feeling better.
- Have a good day, Frank.

29:09.990 --> 29:11.190
You OK?

29:25.950 --> 29:27.590
Let me see that.

29:29.070 --> 29:30.150
This is the house.

29:44.110 --> 29:47.030
It seems they've left.
Mickey said they left in a hurry.

29:47.190 --> 29:49.190
I tried to call them,
but there's no reply.

29:49.910 --> 29:51.310
Oh, OK.

29:52.990 --> 29:54.590
What's with this plaster?

29:54.750 --> 29:56.550
That's evidence.
We probably shouldn't...

29:56.710 --> 29:58.550
There's flecks of cotton attached.

29:58.710 --> 30:02.110
Is that how they found Jesse's DNA,
from that plaster?

30:03.310 --> 30:06.390
Did you investigate the reasons
why he might have been wearing it?

30:07.430 --> 30:08.790
We spoke to the manufacturer.

30:08.950 --> 30:10.950
It's one of the most common
plasters on the market.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.830
But not in homes,
in hospitals, immunisation clinics.

30:14.870 --> 30:17.590
There's a place less than a mile
away from the murder site

30:17.750 --> 30:20.550
that does flu shots, holiday jabs.

30:20.710 --> 30:24.270
We checked their records,
viewed their CCTV. Drew a blank.

30:25.710 --> 30:29.110
- What about blood donation?
- Checked. All the major centres.

30:29.270 --> 30:30.670
- Nothing.
- Travelling ones?

30:32.470 --> 30:35.830
Well, the Blood Service do
a sort of roaming collection.

30:37.350 --> 30:40.990
Town halls and hotels
and sports centres, that kind of thing.

30:41.150 --> 30:43.590
Right. I'd have to check.

30:44.270 --> 30:46.790
Don't blood donations
use a massive cotton swab?

30:46.950 --> 30:48.790
You have to hold them down,
apply pressure?

30:48.950 --> 30:51.270
On the arm,
but not on a thumb prick.

30:51.430 --> 30:54.270
And there could be cotton
from where it's wiped.

30:54.430 --> 30:56.550
What do I know?
You're the detective.

30:56.710 --> 30:58.550
But speaking as a doctor,

30:58.710 --> 31:02.470
I don't think a flu shot
would leave that much blood.

31:04.670 --> 31:05.710
Right.

31:16.470 --> 31:19.430
It's remote. Right?
No one can see anything.

31:21.630 --> 31:24.910
- You can feel it, can't you?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

31:30.470 --> 31:32.870
Well, there's furniture,
but nothing much else.

31:35.870 --> 31:38.030
Come on. Let's go and look inside.

32:00.870 --> 32:01.830
It's open.

32:33.950 --> 32:35.670
Who just leaves a house behind?

32:35.830 --> 32:37.830
Someone leaving in a hurry.

32:40.190 --> 32:43.390
We've got food wrappers, drinks cartons.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.510
These are recent.

32:46.390 --> 32:49.070
Yeah? How can you tell?

32:49.870 --> 32:51.190
I'm a detective.

32:52.590 --> 32:54.510
They also have a use-by date.

32:54.670 --> 32:56.070
I'll get them tested.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.990
But someone was here.

33:15.550 --> 33:17.550
- Did you hear that?
- Uh-huh.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.230
There's someone in the house.

34:06.790 --> 34:08.150
Hiya.

34:08.870 --> 34:10.710
Yeah. Uh-huh.

34:11.350 --> 34:14.110
Great.
Thank you, Phillipa, this is a great help.

34:14.270 --> 34:15.989
Thank you. Bye.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.389
The Ferry Hotel.

34:20.230 --> 34:23.230
They only had one mobile donor
service on the day of the murder.

34:23.389 --> 34:25.469
- What about the day before?
- Nothing the day before.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.710
And no one really
wears a plaster that long.

34:27.870 --> 34:30.469
We need to find out who gave
blood that day. What's their system?

34:30.630 --> 34:34.389
There's confidential reports on all
the patients and all blood donors

34:34.550 --> 34:36.670
have to register with
the National Blood Service.

34:36.830 --> 34:37.909
OK.

34:38.070 --> 34:41.750
But she did say that the tendency
was to choose locations

34:41.909 --> 34:45.550
with pre-existing security systems
for the safety of the staff.

34:46.190 --> 34:47.030
CCTV.

34:49.630 --> 34:50.790
Come on, then.

34:53.230 --> 34:55.510
Look, I...
I know what this looks like, but...

34:55.670 --> 34:57.790
Well, no one's been here for years
and I...

34:58.270 --> 34:59.990
I kind of look after the place.

35:00.150 --> 35:02.790
- Look after it?
- Yeah. For free.

35:03.430 --> 35:06.390
I do him a favour, you know.
Not that he knows it.

35:07.830 --> 35:11.270
I chase away the vandals
and I make the place look nice.

35:13.550 --> 35:15.950
I live next door. Down the hill.

35:17.550 --> 35:20.310
Look, I only come here to escape the wife.

35:20.470 --> 35:24.270
I've got three kids at home
and a crazy mother-in-law.

35:25.430 --> 35:26.870
She's a nightmare, I tell you.

35:27.030 --> 35:29.590
Cause a man needs space, doesn't he?

35:29.750 --> 35:31.350
This is kind of my man-cave.

35:31.510 --> 35:34.110
Do you know anything about
the people that used to live here?

35:34.270 --> 35:37.550
A family used to come up here
for the holidays, you know?

35:37.710 --> 35:40.270
- In the Easter, summer.
- Can you remember them?

35:40.430 --> 35:44.190
Was it a man? A wife? Kids? What?

35:44.350 --> 35:46.670
Well, there was a man and woman

35:46.830 --> 35:49.230
and er...
they had a little lad with them.

35:49.870 --> 35:51.830
Might have been their son,
I don't know.

35:52.990 --> 35:54.630
Do you remember any names?

35:55.630 --> 35:56.630
Erm...

35:57.710 --> 35:59.150
Frank Lipton?

35:59.310 --> 36:02.390
No, no. It was... Ron something.

36:02.550 --> 36:07.950
And I think his wife was called
erm... Bev, was it? Bev?

36:08.670 --> 36:10.790
I'm sorry, it was a long time ago.

36:11.550 --> 36:14.550
Get down! Leave him alone
or I'll blow your brains out!

36:15.550 --> 36:17.510
- What, with an air rifle?
- Carol!

36:17.670 --> 36:20.270
- They're the bloody police!
- Thank you, GI Jane.

36:21.910 --> 36:23.190
- The police?
- Yeah.

36:23.350 --> 36:26.310
How many times have I told you
to stay out of this house?

36:27.230 --> 36:29.150
He thinks I'm stupid.

36:29.310 --> 36:32.390
He comes here with his baby oil
and his wank mags.

36:32.550 --> 36:35.110
- Oh, drinking again?
- Drinking, yes.

36:35.270 --> 36:36.830
Wanking, no!

36:38.310 --> 36:41.110
I come up here to have a drink
so I can get away from you,

36:41.270 --> 36:42.350
you bloody woman!

36:42.510 --> 36:46.670
I hate to interrupt this beautiful
moment of... marital bliss,

36:46.830 --> 36:50.750
but do you happen to know the names
of the people that owned this place?

36:51.350 --> 36:53.190
Harkett? Hackett?

36:53.710 --> 36:55.510
Something beginning with 'H'.

36:56.430 --> 37:00.230
It's in my filofax. I send them
a Christmas card every Christmas.

37:00.390 --> 37:03.510
You do?
So... you've got their current address?

37:03.670 --> 37:05.790
Yeah.

37:05.950 --> 37:08.350
Oh, sorry. It's Jen. I'll just...

37:09.110 --> 37:11.710
- Yeah?
- You'll have to come to the house.

37:11.870 --> 37:14.150
Hey, Jen. Listen,
I can't really talk right now.

37:14.310 --> 37:17.750
<i>Dad, there's a fire!
The house is on fire!</i>

37:17.910 --> 37:20.390
- What? Where's your mum?
- <i>Inside, trying to get Granddad out.</i>

37:20.550 --> 37:22.590
<i>He won't come out. I'm scared!</i>

37:22.750 --> 37:25.790
OK, listen to me.
Call 999... Meg? Meg?

37:26.390 --> 37:29.110
Hey, Danny,
she's got the address at their house.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.550
Danny! Danny, what's going on?

37:31.710 --> 37:33.950
There's an emergency.
I'm gonna send someone!

37:43.990 --> 37:45.270
You've time for a brew, then.

38:02.790 --> 38:03.950
Police?

38:04.750 --> 38:07.030
I'm the manager, Steve Simmons.
How can I help you?

38:07.190 --> 38:09.470
There was a mobile blood session
at this location

38:09.630 --> 38:11.270
on Wednesday 15th April.

38:11.430 --> 38:14.670
As part of an ongoing investigation
we'd like to check your CCTV footage

38:14.830 --> 38:16.270
for that day.

38:16.430 --> 38:18.150
15th April? That's gonna be tricky.

38:18.310 --> 38:20.550
See, we erase
the discs every seven days.

38:20.710 --> 38:22.550
It's a file space issue.

38:24.070 --> 38:25.550
I'm really sorry.

38:30.510 --> 38:33.510
- You OK?
- Do you see what I see?

38:36.790 --> 38:38.270
That camera outside that pub.

38:39.110 --> 38:40.870
Let's see if they delete
after a week.

38:43.310 --> 38:44.390
Jen!

38:45.110 --> 38:46.310
We're out. We're fine.

38:46.470 --> 38:48.070
<i>The fire brigade
are in the house now.</i>

38:48.230 --> 38:50.110
- What happened?
- He set fire to the house.

38:50.270 --> 38:52.350
<i>He could have killed us all.</i>

38:59.510 --> 39:01.230
You can't go back in yet.
It's too dangerous.

39:06.790 --> 39:07.750
Ray, listen to me.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.390
You can't go back in the house yet.

39:09.550 --> 39:10.390
Ray!

39:18.390 --> 39:20.830
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Huh?

39:22.110 --> 39:22.990
Huh?

39:27.230 --> 39:28.430
Hit me!

39:29.390 --> 39:30.630
Hit me!

39:32.310 --> 39:34.470
Hit me! Hit me!

40:07.830 --> 40:10.870
Are you OK?
You're OK, you're safe.

40:11.990 --> 40:13.070
I'm sorry.

40:41.910 --> 40:43.910
I don't want to be like him, Jen.

40:46.510 --> 40:48.670
I love him,
but I don't want to be like him.

40:48.830 --> 40:53.110
Just angry and always working
and never there for his kids. I just...

40:57.790 --> 41:00.510
Can you help me? Just...

41:08.390 --> 41:10.270
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Slade.

41:10.430 --> 41:12.910
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.

41:13.070 --> 41:15.350
Danny's just left me at this farmhouse.

41:16.070 --> 41:17.750
<i>We've got a new lead.</i>

41:23.510 --> 41:26.230
I
think we might be wasting our time.

41:26.390 --> 41:28.150
I mean, there's hours of this stuff.

41:29.550 --> 41:31.510
I'm not even sure
what we're looking for.

41:31.670 --> 41:32.870
Jesse.

41:33.110 --> 41:35.310
Right, but how will we know
if we see him?

42:06.030 --> 42:10.310
Hi, excuse me.
We're looking for Ronald Hatchett.

42:10.470 --> 42:12.510
- First door on your right.
- Thank you.

42:24.150 --> 42:26.270
Ally. Ally.

42:26.430 --> 42:28.030
- What?
- You have to see this.

42:32.830 --> 42:34.230
Oh, my God.

43:07.430 --> 43:08.470
Mark.

43:09.310 --> 43:10.430
Frank.

43:13.550 --> 43:15.350
It's a smiley face backpack.

43:15.510 --> 43:18.270
Mark said the man
he was chasing was wearing one.

43:19.710 --> 43:20.910
It's Karl.
