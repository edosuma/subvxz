[man giving lecture]

02:28.208 --> 02:30.875
[lecturer] So who wants to read?
Come on, it's like the...

02:30.958 --> 02:34.083
What is it? The fourth week now?
Let's hear someone else.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.291
Do you, um...

02:40.625 --> 02:41.458
Lisa.

02:41.791 --> 02:43.166
Lisa, do you mind sharing?

02:43.666 --> 02:45.458
No. [takes deep breath]

03:04.500 --> 03:06.250
So what did you write this week?

03:08.958 --> 03:10.583
A short one. A haiku.

03:11.541 --> 03:12.541
Oh, really?

03:12.916 --> 03:14.333
I didn't see you work on it.

03:15.583 --> 03:16.791
I did it on the ferry.

03:20.208 --> 03:21.041
Read it to me?

03:45.083 --> 03:46.875
A dream garden blooms

03:48.250 --> 03:51.625

04:00.458 --> 04:01.666
It's good, Lis.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.166
They didn't like it.

04:08.958 --> 04:12.708
[takes deep breath]
Someone said it was derivative.

04:15.041 --> 04:16.666
But they always say that, right?

04:17.875 --> 04:20.333
They say it if it's good,
they say it if it's bad.

04:24.375 --> 04:27.416
My teacher said I need to put
more of myself in my work.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.291

04:38.833 --> 04:39.916
What is it, like,

04:43.250 --> 04:44.708
the flowers out by the pool?

04:47.916 --> 04:48.750
Yeah.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.125
More or less.

04:58.708 --> 05:00.333
I'm going to go cut some paper.

05:43.958 --> 05:45.708
[Lisa] Okay, let's move on to "S."

05:46.875 --> 05:49.291
Do you guys see the "S"
at the top of your paper?

05:49.416 --> 05:52.791
And do you see
how there's a piece of an "S"?

05:53.291 --> 05:56.250
Can you see if you can finish that "S"?

05:57.625 --> 05:59.083
That's really good, Derek.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.958
So, when you think of an "S,"
think about...

06:01.041 --> 06:05.791
the curve of a slithering
[imitating snake hiss] sss...

06:06.041 --> 06:07.125
-What?
-Snake.

06:07.250 --> 06:11.041
[Lisa] Snake. That's right.
Actually, everybody think of a snake.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.791
Think of the way a snake moves

06:13.916 --> 06:16.166
when it sort of slithers on the ground,
right?

06:16.250 --> 06:19.166
Ssss, right?

06:19.875 --> 06:20.750
Good job.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.583
Okay. How are you guys doing over here?

06:23.666 --> 06:25.875
-[girl] My hand hurts.
-Yeah.

06:25.958 --> 06:28.666
We've been doing this for a long time,
haven't we?

06:29.708 --> 06:33.041
Okay. We're going to do song circle
after one more letter.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.750
You guys got one more letter in you?

06:35.000 --> 06:39.291
Yeah. One more letter. Does anybody have
any idea what the next letter is?

06:39.375 --> 06:40.333
[children] "T"!

06:40.416 --> 06:43.833
"T" is the letter that comes after "S"
in the alphabet.

06:43.916 --> 06:48.666
Very good! "T" is a tall, tough letter,
like a hard tooth!

06:49.083 --> 06:51.041
-Or like a...
-[girl] Tusk.

06:51.125 --> 06:54.125
[Lisa] Like a tusk. Yes. Very good.

07:02.375 --> 07:03.208
Hey.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.541
Can I see a beautiful "T"?

07:09.000 --> 07:09.833
Thank you.

07:13.750 --> 07:14.583
You know what?

07:14.666 --> 07:18.791
Finish up the letter you're working on
and let's do song circle.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.250
Okay, give your papers to Meghan.

I don't know.

08:52.166 --> 08:53.166
Was that a poem?

08:54.125 --> 08:57.250
That was a poem. It's remarkable.

08:58.833 --> 09:01.166
I think we should write it down. Right?

09:01.875 --> 09:02.875

Becca, would you do me a favor?

09:41.333 --> 09:43.833
If he does this again, will you promise
you write it down for me?

09:44.416 --> 09:45.833
Yeah, I can do that for you.

09:45.916 --> 09:46.833

09:49.250 --> 09:50.666

Yeah. It was fine.

-[Brittany] That he likes me

10:44.500 --> 10:47.583

he had to have a talk with Katrina.

-Five and a half.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.750
It's extraordinary.

12:07.125 --> 12:10.458

lots of words at that age, but...

12:10.541 --> 12:12.541
[takes deep breath]

12:14.625 --> 12:16.333
...it conjures a feeling.

12:17.958 --> 12:19.166
So specific.

12:21.041 --> 12:21.916
Is he religious?

12:23.541 --> 12:24.916
No, I don't think so.

12:27.333 --> 12:30.291
It's just weird that someone so young
would write about God.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.083
It's... It's disturbing, slightly.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.500
Why do you say that?

12:47.916 --> 12:49.833
Why do you use the word "disturbing?"

12:51.500 --> 12:52.708
I don't know.

12:56.125 --> 13:00.500
It's not disturbing, I suppose.
It's more like...

13:01.666 --> 13:02.750
peculiar.

13:03.541 --> 13:06.250
The whole God thing. I don't know.

What do you guys think?

13:37.416 --> 13:39.333
[class chattering]

13:39.458 --> 13:42.166
[Justin] I love that line,
"Beautiful enough for me."

13:42.875 --> 13:45.458
It suggests so many things. Like...

13:45.541 --> 13:48.166
you don't deserve much,
or you don't prioritize beauty.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.291
But then the word "beautiful" is repeated,

13:52.541 --> 13:56.375
so I feel like you do in fact value it
in some deep way,

13:56.458 --> 13:58.541
and that you really find Anna beautiful.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.750
Yeah! I think it was really good.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.000
Really good, because...

14:03.416 --> 14:06.791
with so few elements
you make something very...

14:07.208 --> 14:08.208
very complex.

14:09.250 --> 14:12.958
It's as if it was said by someone
that has seen a lot of beauty,

14:14.500 --> 14:17.083
but now, you know,
makes do with very little.

14:18.916 --> 14:22.250
Okay, so for next week,
I would like you all to focus...

14:23.166 --> 14:24.541
on the boring things.

14:25.083 --> 14:26.708
The banal, the mundane. Just,

14:27.333 --> 14:30.166
you know, try it and see
if the act of writing about something

14:30.250 --> 14:32.083
can transform it into something new.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.083
Let's see.

No. That is an awful word.
All of you guys.

14:56.375 --> 14:59.666
That's a very powerful word
and you guys are just little kids,

14:59.750 --> 15:01.500
and there's no place for that here.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.250
I know you guys are better than that.

I'm sorry, Jimmy,
but I have to give you a timeout.

tell me about your poem.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.375
Who is Anna?

15:37.791 --> 15:39.125
Is she someone you know?

15:47.541 --> 15:48.708
How about your mommy?

15:50.333 --> 15:51.416
Is her name Anna?

15:53.750 --> 15:55.166
My mom is dead.

[children shouting at the yard]

16:11.625 --> 16:13.541
Remember when we planted these?

16:14.791 --> 16:16.750
They were just tiny little seeds.

16:17.416 --> 16:18.916
What does this one smell like?

16:19.333 --> 16:20.208
Smell.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.833
-[Jimmy] Tomato.
-Yeah. Tomato.

I'm sorry I had to give you a timeout.

17:26.333 --> 17:27.541
I don't like doing that.

17:29.666 --> 17:32.500
I know you can be steady
and use beautiful words.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.166
"Ho" is a boring word.

It's a word boring kids say.

Hey...

17:44.375 --> 17:46.000
Let's look at the kindergarten.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.750
These toys, we play with them everyday.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.083
Or the sunflower.

17:53.958 --> 17:56.125
I see the sunflower every single day.

17:57.666 --> 17:59.208
And our butterfly?

17:59.958 --> 18:02.708
Right? They're part of
our everyday routine.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.208
Maybe, if we try...

18:09.125 --> 18:10.750
we can see something new.

18:16.416 --> 18:17.541
Do you feel anything?

18:19.833 --> 18:20.666
[Jimmy] No.

18:24.791 --> 18:26.791
-[opens sink]
-[washing cups]

18:36.250 --> 18:38.500
-[sighs] Hi.
-[Lisa] Hi.

18:38.583 --> 18:39.416
Sorry.

18:39.583 --> 18:40.500
-That's okay.
-Hey.

18:43.541 --> 18:46.333
Meghan, can you take Jimmy
to get his clay sculpture?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.541
-I think it's still drying outside.
-Sure, I'll get it.

18:48.625 --> 18:51.291
-Do you mind if we chat for a minute?
-Yeah.

18:52.916 --> 18:57.208
Um... I just felt like Jimmy was acting
a little strange today.

18:57.958 --> 19:00.916
He was energetic at recess
and then he was...

19:02.125 --> 19:05.000
very quiet. He hardly said a word
for the rest of the day.

19:05.416 --> 19:07.875
Yeah. He does get quiet like that.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.000
That's true. I mean he's a weirdo.

19:11.791 --> 19:14.583
But how often does he compose poems?

19:15.458 --> 19:18.458
Mmm... I don't know, like once a week.

19:18.541 --> 19:21.583
-Maybe like every few days.
-Really?

19:22.083 --> 19:23.458
Yeah. He'll just, like...

19:23.875 --> 19:26.875
pop up. Start walking back and forth
like a zombie, like,

19:27.041 --> 19:28.500
mumbling to himself.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.041
Yeah. I hadn't seen him do it ever
before Monday.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.083
I got to say, they're really cool.

19:33.625 --> 19:36.000
-I like them.
-And what does his family think?

19:36.250 --> 19:38.500
Oh! Nobody knows he does it, but me.
[laughs]

19:39.541 --> 19:41.500
His dad's like a really busy guy.

19:41.958 --> 19:45.125
He owns that big night club in Bayonne.
Ultra Lounge?

19:45.666 --> 19:49.541
His mom is doing her thing in Miami.
She's not around.

19:49.708 --> 19:50.583
Okay.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.166
And Jimmy said she was dead.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.125
-No.
-Yeah.

19:55.208 --> 19:57.625
I didn't think so. Usually,
I'm informed of that kind of thing.

19:57.958 --> 20:00.166
It was a really nasty custody battle.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.833
And are you close with his dad?

20:03.666 --> 20:04.916
Yeah, we work together.

20:06.791 --> 20:07.625
So I know him.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.250
I did coat check at Ultra Lounge
for a year,

20:12.458 --> 20:14.666
and then I quit to pursue acting.

20:15.416 --> 20:17.375
But then he said he needed a nanny.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.875
So, I was, like,
this is a perfect part-time.

20:20.666 --> 20:22.541
-[chuckles] Good.
-But you know what?

20:22.708 --> 20:25.041
His uncle, Sanjay, does come by the house,

20:25.750 --> 20:29.041
and Jimmy tells me they read poems,
works on a newspaper.

20:29.166 --> 20:31.625
That's good to know.
I'm glad there's some support...

20:31.750 --> 20:32.666
in the house.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.666
And you like acting?

20:36.708 --> 20:37.541
Yeah.

20:38.458 --> 20:39.291
I do.

20:40.791 --> 20:43.041
-Well, good luck with that.
-Thank you.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.791
Oh! I almost forgot.

20:46.708 --> 20:47.958
There was one yesterday.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.500
You want to see it?
I wrote it down like you said.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.916
Yes, sure. I'd love to take a look at it.

21:04.958 --> 21:07.666
"The bull stood alone in the backyard.

21:08.750 --> 21:09.583
So dark.

21:11.625 --> 21:13.625
I opened the door and stepped out.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.416
Wind in the branches.

21:16.291 --> 21:17.416
He watched me,

21:18.291 --> 21:19.291
Blue eyes.

21:20.291 --> 21:22.791
He kept breathing to stay alive.

21:24.125 --> 21:25.208
I didn't want him.

21:25.583 --> 21:26.833
I was just a boy.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.166
Say yes,

21:31.666 --> 21:33.083
Say yes, anyway."

21:37.083 --> 21:37.916
Wow.

21:38.583 --> 21:39.708
[chairs moving]

21:39.833 --> 21:41.875
I like the "breathing to stay alive".

21:42.625 --> 21:43.875
What do you guys think?

21:44.791 --> 21:47.000
[Justin]
I was trying to understand the assignment.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.958
I thought everything was supposed
to be observational,

21:50.083 --> 21:52.041
and about things that we see everyday.

21:52.458 --> 21:56.208
I mean it is great, but this seems
like an exercise in surrealism.

21:56.291 --> 21:58.916
[Simon] You don't have to be literal
with my assignments, you know?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.750
These are just exercises
that spark your creativity.

22:01.833 --> 22:04.833
[Marianne] You know, it might have been
helpful to know that beforehand.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.375
[Simon]
Okay. Well, I'm sorry. I apologize.

22:08.083 --> 22:11.708
But I find it really interesting
that you just went your own way. Really.

22:12.541 --> 22:16.083
You know, sometimes poets, like bulls,
they should be stubborn.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.375
[Michael] I like the poem a lot.

22:18.750 --> 22:21.875
I'm just wondering why you wrote it
from a boy's point of view.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.208
[class murmurs]

22:25.375 --> 22:26.208
I don't know.

22:26.791 --> 22:30.166
Because she can.
That's what's interesting.

22:30.333 --> 22:33.458
You know, it's interesting to see things
from a new vantage point.

22:36.541 --> 22:38.875
Well, guys, we have to leave, but...

22:39.000 --> 22:42.166
this week,
try using another point of view. Okay?

22:42.625 --> 22:45.125
Let's see what happens. All right?
And, please,

22:45.208 --> 22:48.375
just really, don't try to please me.
That's not the point.

22:49.083 --> 22:52.500
Okay? All right. Thank you. Bye-bye.

22:52.875 --> 22:54.208
[door unlocks and grinds]

22:55.416 --> 22:57.041
Hey. How was class?

22:57.291 --> 22:58.291
It was good.

23:00.125 --> 23:01.125
Yeah, it was better.

23:03.375 --> 23:05.708
-Are the kids upstairs?
-I think so.

23:07.958 --> 23:08.791
Hey.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.833
Hi.

23:13.666 --> 23:15.666
Did you just get back
from your poetry class?

23:15.750 --> 23:16.583
Yeah.

23:16.916 --> 23:18.500
Your hair looks nice like that.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.625
-[typing on mobile phone]
-[TV on]

23:21.541 --> 23:22.500
Where's Josh?

23:23.333 --> 23:24.166
Tutoring.

23:25.250 --> 23:26.083
Good.

23:28.458 --> 23:30.125
Are there any college kids there?

23:30.625 --> 23:32.291
-Where?
-In your class.

23:32.791 --> 23:33.625
No.

23:34.125 --> 23:36.875
It's all adults.
It's a continuing education class.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.291
Oh.

23:40.791 --> 23:42.375
Hey, don't you have work to do?

23:43.041 --> 23:44.791
Yeah. I finished it in study hall.

23:46.166 --> 23:49.375
[takes deep breath]
I was thinking about...

23:50.708 --> 23:53.291
how great you were
at photography last year.

23:53.916 --> 23:55.875
Why don't you take Dad's old camera,

23:55.958 --> 23:58.541
and lenses, and take a walk
around the neighborhood?

23:58.958 --> 24:01.125
I post cool stuff on Instagram
all the time.

24:01.250 --> 24:04.000
Yeah. But developing in a dark room
is totally different

24:04.458 --> 24:07.375
It just stinks in there,
with all the chemicals and stuff.

24:09.041 --> 24:09.875
Okay.

24:12.708 --> 24:14.916
Just something I noticed
you were good at.

24:16.250 --> 24:20.500
Hi, Mr. Roy.
This is Lisa Spinelli calling.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.375
I'm Jimmy's kindergarten teacher.

24:22.916 --> 24:24.416
And I was just calling

24:24.500 --> 24:28.166
because I would like to talk to you
about your son when you have a moment.

24:29.291 --> 24:32.333
I left a message on Tuesday
with all my information,

24:32.416 --> 24:35.250
so, please, give me a call
when you get a chance.

24:35.375 --> 24:36.541
Thanks a lot. Bye.

24:40.208 --> 24:41.375
[sighs]

24:46.291 --> 24:48.250
[Lisa] I'm really curious
what's gonna happen

24:48.333 --> 24:49.875
when you have no white on the paper.

24:49.958 --> 24:53.208
-I don't have any white on my paper.
-Yeah. Let's see, here it is.

24:53.833 --> 24:56.083
Oh, you need a little more room
on the paper.

24:56.916 --> 24:58.541
Here you go.

24:58.958 --> 25:00.958
[children chattering]

25:01.291 --> 25:02.916
Do you need something, Abby?

25:03.416 --> 25:04.291
What do you need?

25:05.041 --> 25:07.916
[Lisa] Now, do you think you guys can make
a chrome yellow?

25:08.333 --> 25:10.791
Like in Van Gough's "Wheat Fields"?

25:10.875 --> 25:13.541
Remember how beautiful that color was?

25:18.250 --> 25:21.083
Is this the volcano here,
and the lava coming out?

25:25.458 --> 25:29.208
[paint brushing]

25:30.166 --> 25:32.166
[birds chirping]

26:12.375 --> 26:13.541
[Lisa whispering] Hey, Jimmy.

26:17.916 --> 26:18.875
Jimmy.

26:22.458 --> 26:23.291
Hey, Jimmy.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.250
Will you come with me?

26:30.916 --> 26:32.583
[whispering] Where are we going?

26:33.083 --> 26:34.041
Come here.

26:51.166 --> 26:54.083
-Why are we in the bathroom?
-[door grinds and closes]

26:56.125 --> 26:59.625
[whispering] Because I want to talk to you
about something. Hey.

27:01.458 --> 27:05.416
I want to talk to you about something
that I think is very important for a poet.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.125
It's called your point of view.

27:09.875 --> 27:12.291
So, here we are. We're in a bathroom.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.416
But there's not just one bathroom.

27:17.125 --> 27:19.833
-[whispers] There's many bathrooms?
-[Lisa] Yes.

27:20.125 --> 27:22.541
There's many bathrooms, because, look,

27:23.166 --> 27:24.250
If you're a grown-up,

27:25.916 --> 27:27.375
the bathroom looks like this.

27:28.375 --> 27:30.083
Yeah, you're a big grown-up Jimmy.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.125
What do you think? Look around.

27:35.416 --> 27:38.458
I bet there's all sorts of things
you didn't notice before.

27:38.583 --> 27:40.583
[children playing in the yard]

27:42.750 --> 27:44.166
What else do you want to be?

27:45.083 --> 27:46.250
You want to be a giant?

27:46.791 --> 27:48.208
Okay. Turn around.

27:49.958 --> 27:51.708
What do you see from up there?

27:53.666 --> 27:54.875
What's it like up there?

27:56.416 --> 27:59.041
-The bathroom is so tiny.
-Do you like it?

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
-Yes.
-What else? A cat!

28:02.791 --> 28:04.791
Let's be a cat down here. Look, down here.

28:04.875 --> 28:05.833
I'm a cat.

28:06.458 --> 28:10.666
[Jimmy and Lisa meowing]

28:11.000 --> 28:13.791
So if you stay open,

28:14.541 --> 28:16.541
and if you stay curious,

28:16.875 --> 28:19.291
then you can see the world
however you want.

28:19.583 --> 28:21.791
You can see the world
like a little tiny bug.

28:22.250 --> 28:23.458
Or like a bad guy.

28:25.708 --> 28:26.958
You know what I mean?

28:28.250 --> 28:30.708
Can I go back to nap time now?

28:32.291 --> 28:33.958
Will you think about what I said?

28:35.250 --> 28:36.458
Will you think about it?

28:37.333 --> 28:38.166
All right.

28:52.666 --> 28:54.000
[Lisa whispering] Jimmy.

28:56.875 --> 28:58.125
Jimmy, one more thing.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.416
[washing cups]

29:35.166 --> 29:37.041
[Jimmy recites a poem]

29:37.166 --> 29:38.291
It gets so dark

29:38.916 --> 29:40.666
It stays dark,

29:41.083 --> 29:43.375
Even when I turn on the light.

29:45.375 --> 29:46.625
It gets so bright,

29:47.375 --> 29:49.583
The flowers bow to the sun.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.541
Do you remember the lion?

29:53.916 --> 29:56.291
So quick and so strong.

29:56.916 --> 29:59.458
He has no master
when his master is sleeping.

29:59.916 --> 30:02.125
And all his master does is sleep.

30:08.500 --> 30:12.083
[Lisa laughs and sighs]

30:13.250 --> 30:14.416
That was a poem.

30:17.291 --> 30:19.875
Can you say it for me again,
so I can write it down?

30:25.750 --> 30:28.791
Meghan, did you catch what he was saying?
Did you get the beginning?

30:28.875 --> 30:30.166
Sorry. I had the water running.

30:30.500 --> 30:33.625
I think he was singing a song.
He seems to be doing that a lot.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.791
They aren't songs. They're poems.

30:38.833 --> 30:40.750
It was about a dead lion.

30:42.583 --> 30:43.583
You see?

30:51.750 --> 30:53.458
What am I going to do with you?

30:55.000 --> 30:57.083
-[footsteps]
-[Becca] Hey.

30:57.458 --> 31:00.291
-Becca, we have a little bit of a problem.
-What's wrong?

31:01.541 --> 31:05.000
[Lisa huffs] Poems are disappearing.
It happened just now. He was...

31:05.208 --> 31:07.958
pacing back and forth.
I rushed to get to him

31:08.041 --> 31:11.125
and by the time I got there
he was almost finished. All I got was...

31:11.625 --> 31:14.958
"He has no master
When his master is sleeping.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.916
And all his master does is sleep."

31:23.166 --> 31:25.708
It's from the point of view
of a hunted lion.

31:28.625 --> 31:29.458
I see.

31:30.291 --> 31:32.958
[Lisa] I mean, how often
are we missing these moments?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.250
It's hard to say really, I mean,

31:36.166 --> 31:37.583
I try my best, but--

31:37.666 --> 31:41.375
Out of curiosity, who tucks him
into bed at night? Is it you or...

31:41.458 --> 31:42.333
is it somebody else?

31:42.416 --> 31:43.666
It's mostly me.

31:44.083 --> 31:47.791
I think that's a time to pay attention to.
I mean, imagine how much...

31:48.541 --> 31:50.791
incredible poetry is written in that...

31:51.750 --> 31:55.041
not quite conscious moment
just before the lights go out.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.000
Hey.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.083
You're such a good teacher. You know that?
You have a big heart.

32:01.541 --> 32:03.541
[zips bag] Listen, baby doll.

32:04.125 --> 32:07.083
When you come up with your poems, just
let us know, okay? So we can help you.

32:07.166 --> 32:09.625
Yeah, because we don't want
to miss anything, okay?

32:09.750 --> 32:10.833
Do you have kids?

32:11.083 --> 32:11.916
I do.

32:12.333 --> 32:14.583
-Big? Small?
-They're big. They're in high school.

32:14.666 --> 32:15.500
Oh, wow.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.791
Well, they're really lucky to have you.
You're... very attentive.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.166
Alright, let's go baby.

32:22.458 --> 32:26.041
Okay, so let's just work together to make
sure that all of his work gets heard.

32:26.125 --> 32:27.291
I'll do what I can do.

32:27.833 --> 32:28.708
Bye.

32:34.166 --> 32:36.166
[traffic noises]

32:49.041 --> 32:51.041
[people chattering]

32:56.458 --> 32:57.291
Hi.

32:57.416 --> 32:58.416
Hi, I am Lisa.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.625
We spoke on the phone.

32:59.708 --> 33:00.541
-Yes.
-Hi.

33:00.625 --> 33:02.625
-Hi, Lisa.
-Is now still an okay time?

33:02.708 --> 33:03.791
Yes, of course.

33:04.375 --> 33:06.708
We memorize a few poems, just for fun.

33:07.708 --> 33:09.250
Well, he composes, too.

33:09.791 --> 33:12.083
-Really? I didn't realize.
-Yes, and I...

33:12.291 --> 33:14.291
I wanted to speak to you because...

33:15.833 --> 33:18.625
I imagine, maybe,
you can appreciate how rare

33:18.875 --> 33:20.250
that gift is.

33:20.958 --> 33:22.000
I mean, I've been...

33:22.291 --> 33:25.666
a kindergarten teacher for almost 20 years
and I've never seen anything like it.

33:25.750 --> 33:29.583
And I just want to support it, and I want
to protect it as much as I possibly can.

33:29.666 --> 33:30.500
Absolutely.

33:30.583 --> 33:31.500
Talent is so...

33:33.000 --> 33:34.958
fragile and so rare.

33:35.125 --> 33:37.375
And our culture does everything
to crush it.

33:37.458 --> 33:39.750
I mean even at four or five,
they're coming into school

33:39.833 --> 33:43.166
attached to their phones, talking only
about TV shows and video games.

33:43.250 --> 33:44.958
It's a materialistic culture,

33:45.041 --> 33:47.500
and it doesn't support art, or language,

33:49.000 --> 33:50.250
or observation.

33:51.625 --> 33:54.666
Even my own children, who are great,
they don't read.

33:56.083 --> 33:57.291
You know, you think...

33:57.708 --> 33:59.375
maybe it's just a phase.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.500
But I worry that it's something larger.

34:07.166 --> 34:08.833
A lack of curiosity.

34:10.166 --> 34:11.541
A lack of reflection.

34:11.958 --> 34:13.958
No one has space for poetry.

34:14.791 --> 34:15.708
Maybe that's true.

34:17.250 --> 34:20.750
Really, what I want is to speak
with his father.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.041
His father?

34:22.125 --> 34:25.666
I wonder if he would allow me
to oversee his progress.

34:28.333 --> 34:31.333
[sighs] Well, he is a busy man and frankly

34:31.416 --> 34:33.583
I don't know
how much you'll get out of him.

34:34.875 --> 34:35.791
Have you met him?

34:35.875 --> 34:36.708
No.

34:36.833 --> 34:39.291
He doesn't actually
even return my phone calls.

34:41.500 --> 34:42.916
Maybe the babysitter can help?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.583
-Becca?
-Yes, Becca.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.166
Well, between you and me,

34:46.250 --> 34:48.833
I think Becca is a problematic element
in this too.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.583
I mean she doesn't understand
the depth of his talent.

34:53.416 --> 34:55.416
[phone ringing]

34:56.166 --> 35:00.291
Listen, I apologize,
but I should get back to work soon.

35:00.375 --> 35:01.208
I'm sorry.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.333
Okay.

35:02.416 --> 35:05.041
I'll... speak to my brother soon.

35:06.750 --> 35:09.958
-I'll see if I can catch him this week.
-That would be wonderful.

35:11.625 --> 35:13.625
[sighs]

35:15.458 --> 35:17.875
I should...
I really have a deadline, so...

35:17.958 --> 35:18.791
Okay.

35:19.375 --> 35:20.833
-You know your way out.
-I do.

35:42.750 --> 35:45.916
[whispering] Hey Jimmy. Will you come
with me to the playground?

35:46.041 --> 35:48.208
I want to talk to you about something.

35:48.291 --> 35:49.291
Come on. Let's play.

36:00.083 --> 36:01.500
They have five more minutes.

36:01.583 --> 36:02.416
-Okay.
-Okay.

36:13.083 --> 36:16.041
Jimmy, I want to talk to you
about something very important.

36:16.250 --> 36:18.000
When you have a poem in your head,

36:19.041 --> 36:20.458
and when your poem is ready,

36:20.958 --> 36:22.666
-[crow croaks]
-...will you come to me?

36:23.416 --> 36:26.500
Even if you see I'm busy
or I'm talking to somebody else,

36:26.750 --> 36:30.166
or if you're mad at me that day,
or if you think I'm mad at you,

36:32.500 --> 36:33.875
will you please come to me?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
[birds chirping]

36:37.333 --> 36:39.875
If it happens when you're not at school,
it's okay.

36:40.791 --> 36:42.250
You can call me on the phone.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.500
You don't have to recite your poem
to Becca.

36:45.875 --> 36:47.708
It's better if you call me,
you understand?

36:47.791 --> 36:49.166
I'll write it down for you.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.541
And don't let her call you silly names
like puppy dog and...

36:54.166 --> 36:57.041
bunny rabbit. It's belittling.
It means she's treating you like a baby.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.458
So, look. I took your cell phone
from your backpack.

37:01.541 --> 37:02.375
Hope that's okay.

37:03.833 --> 37:06.958
And I'd like to put my number in it,
so you have it if you need it.

37:07.833 --> 37:09.958
I'm not going to put it in
under Mrs. Spinelli

37:10.041 --> 37:12.000
because that is too long.

37:13.125 --> 37:15.291
I'm going to type in the letter L.

37:15.583 --> 37:16.416
See?

37:17.500 --> 37:18.333
"L..."

37:18.666 --> 37:19.500
is...

37:20.375 --> 37:21.208
for Lisa.

37:22.833 --> 37:23.666
That's my name.

37:26.291 --> 37:29.208
So just find "L" when you want to call me.
Okay?

37:30.166 --> 37:31.000
Okay.

37:33.958 --> 37:35.958
[footsteps]

37:36.250 --> 37:37.083
Hello?

37:37.625 --> 37:38.458
Hi.

37:39.041 --> 37:39.875
Hi.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.125
[forks and knives clinking]

37:44.416 --> 37:45.583
[Grant] Where are you headed?

37:46.125 --> 37:47.291
I have practice.

37:47.791 --> 37:51.125
-No you don't. You had it yesterday.
-We have an extra one this week.

37:52.458 --> 37:53.791
Josh, where are you going?

37:54.625 --> 37:55.791
I have a meeting.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.500
[Lisa] Is this Marine stuff?

37:58.833 --> 38:00.833
[Josh humming]

38:01.708 --> 38:02.875
Josh, come in here.

38:07.208 --> 38:10.416
[Grant] We just don't get it.
You worked so hard to get into that school

38:10.583 --> 38:12.750
and you busted your butt,
and you pulled up your grades,

38:12.833 --> 38:14.791
and we're proud of you.
That's all we're saying.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.291
It's not even a good school.

38:16.750 --> 38:19.833
Josh, it's stupid to put yourself
in harm's way.

38:20.250 --> 38:23.500
People get their fucking limbs blown off.

38:23.583 --> 38:25.125
I'm just sick of school, okay?

38:26.541 --> 38:28.125
Plus, I think service is more important

38:28.208 --> 38:30.541
than whatever notion of achievement
you have in your head.

38:30.625 --> 38:34.208
No, if you want to go fight for oil
in the desert, that's fine,

38:34.291 --> 38:35.708
but don't kid yourself.

38:36.125 --> 38:37.375
[door opens]

38:38.458 --> 38:40.458
-[traffic noises]
-[slams door]

38:43.708 --> 38:45.541
[opens sink]

38:48.291 --> 38:51.250
-[drinks water]
-[slams glass in sink]

38:52.125 --> 38:54.125
[Grant sighs]

38:54.875 --> 38:56.875
[moves chair]

38:58.833 --> 39:01.041
Don't worry. He always lands on his feet.

39:01.166 --> 39:02.000
Does he?

39:10.333 --> 39:12.000
-[both sigh]
-[Lisa] I don't know.

39:17.333 --> 39:18.625
Are we finally alone?

39:19.083 --> 39:21.416
[Lisa chuckles]

39:22.000 --> 39:24.041
Can I lock the fucking front door?

39:24.125 --> 39:25.500
-No!
-And make sure...

39:25.875 --> 39:26.750
that no one...

39:27.041 --> 39:29.166
comes back in this house...

39:29.250 --> 39:30.333
ever again?

39:30.416 --> 39:32.416
-[Lisa chuckles]
-[both moaning]

39:41.875 --> 39:43.875
-[phone rings]
-[both moaning]

39:47.541 --> 39:48.833
[Grant] Really?

39:50.083 --> 39:52.083
[phone ringing]

39:55.166 --> 39:56.000
Hello?

39:56.125 --> 39:57.375
Mrs. Spinelli?

39:57.458 --> 39:58.500
Hi, Jimmy.

39:58.791 --> 39:59.916
I have a poem.

40:00.375 --> 40:02.375
[searching for pen and paper]

40:07.666 --> 40:10.625
Wait! Okay. I'm ready to write it down.

40:11.791 --> 40:12.625
Go ahead.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.666
The gold rusts,

40:14.750 --> 40:16.500
The warmth breaks

40:16.625 --> 40:18.583
And the light comes at morning,

40:19.416 --> 40:22.208
The police start their way
to the dining hall,

40:26.041 --> 40:29.166
And the sound of World War Three
is out there.

40:32.291 --> 40:33.500
Dust is out.

40:33.958 --> 40:36.375
And pray God,
The wedding is coming.

40:38.416 --> 40:40.375
And the reciting poem is here.

40:53.208 --> 40:54.458
-[Jimmy winces]
-[Lisa] Shh!

40:56.583 --> 40:58.583
I loved your poem last night.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
[children laughing and playing]

41:11.625 --> 41:13.541
Do you want to hear a poem from me?

41:14.791 --> 41:15.666
Okay.

41:29.708 --> 41:31.708
Mesmerize Me, Butterfly.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.208
Forcing wings open-shut

41:40.291 --> 41:43.166
Thrust with purpose not known to me

41:44.125 --> 41:46.208
Not expert, in your grasses.

41:47.541 --> 41:48.750
In poison

41:49.583 --> 41:52.875
Mushrooms camouflage deliverance

41:54.791 --> 41:58.375
Today the garden teems with wood sprites

41:58.458 --> 41:59.583
Flashing blue

42:00.625 --> 42:01.708
Now white

42:04.291 --> 42:06.000
At the edge of seeing.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.291
[children laughing and playing]

42:12.000 --> 42:13.708
Is that a poem you wrote?

42:16.916 --> 42:17.750
Yeah.

42:28.250 --> 42:30.250
[packs first aid]

42:30.375 --> 42:32.166
You can just forget you heard it.

42:32.833 --> 42:34.791
I don't want to spoil your talent.

42:36.916 --> 42:38.916
-[music playing]
-[people chattering]

43:16.416 --> 43:17.958
Amy, what are you doing?

43:18.458 --> 43:20.541
What's the big deal?
It's been decriminalized.

43:21.083 --> 43:22.166
Can I have it?

43:22.875 --> 43:26.333
You and dad always act like artsy,
progressive hippies!

43:26.416 --> 43:27.416
Okay, you know what?

43:28.916 --> 43:31.583
Smoke it, if you want to.
Maybe it'll open you up.

43:32.375 --> 43:33.750
-You--
-What's going on?

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
...could have such an incredible mind.

43:37.208 --> 43:38.541
Incredible mind?

43:38.791 --> 43:41.375
What's up with you?
You're acting so weird!

43:41.500 --> 43:43.291
We got all our work done.

43:43.375 --> 43:46.291
I wish there was
a little bit more curiosity,

43:46.375 --> 43:49.083
vibrancy, intellectualism in this house.

43:49.166 --> 43:51.916
Ever since you started taking
those dumb-ass poetry classes

43:52.000 --> 43:53.333
you've been acting like you're...

43:53.416 --> 43:55.958
the cultural ambassador
to the UN or something.

43:56.041 --> 43:59.208
Okay, if you want to go back to college
and get your stupid degree,

43:59.291 --> 44:00.416
then you can go ahead.

44:00.500 --> 44:04.208
Okay, I actually get straight A's
without having to work very hard

44:04.583 --> 44:06.166
and you never acknowledge that.

44:06.666 --> 44:09.250
You worked your ass off
and look where you are.

44:09.666 --> 44:11.666
-[teenagers chattering]
-[music playing]

44:23.666 --> 44:24.500
[Grant] Hey.

44:24.708 --> 44:26.041
What the hell is going on?

44:26.125 --> 44:27.041
It's nothing.

44:27.125 --> 44:30.125
She's just being provocative. I'm fine.
I'm going to get some air.

44:48.375 --> 44:50.375
[scrapes lighter]

45:01.833 --> 45:03.833
[airplane passing by]

45:11.750 --> 45:14.083
"Cultural ambassador to the UN."

45:16.125 --> 45:18.125
[birds chirping]

45:34.416 --> 45:36.416
[line ringing]

45:37.416 --> 45:38.291
Hello?

45:38.541 --> 45:39.500
Jimmy, hi.

45:40.750 --> 45:41.708
It's Mrs. Spinelli.

45:42.541 --> 45:43.375
It's Lisa.

45:43.916 --> 45:45.166
Why are you calling me?

45:45.583 --> 45:49.625
It's okay. Kindergarten teachers
are allowed to call their students.

45:50.458 --> 45:52.458
Becca's going to read me a book.

45:52.541 --> 45:54.791
Okay. I know, it must be getting
close to bedtime.

45:54.875 --> 45:56.250
I just wanted to say hi.

45:56.666 --> 45:57.625
Okay.

46:08.833 --> 46:11.166
[Simon]
A home transformed by the lightning,

46:11.958 --> 46:15.875
The balanced alcoves smother
This insatiable earth of a planet,

46:16.208 --> 46:17.166
Earth.

46:17.958 --> 46:22.875
They attacked it with their mechanical
horns because they love you.

46:23.291 --> 46:24.125
Hello?

46:24.250 --> 46:26.250
Hey Lisa, how's it going?
Come, sit down.

46:26.666 --> 46:28.833
I was reading this poem that...

46:29.416 --> 46:30.666
that a computer wrote.

46:31.333 --> 46:32.833
You know, with some algorithm.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.166
It even passed the Turing Test.

46:35.833 --> 46:37.416
In the end, we're all machines.

46:38.708 --> 46:40.958
Well, Justin, thank you,
and good luck with the sonnet.

46:41.041 --> 46:41.916
Yeah, I'll crack it.

46:42.125 --> 46:44.166
[Simon]
Don't make Watson do it. [chuckles]

46:44.375 --> 46:46.875
Cool, man. I'll see you at the reading
on Thursday, then.

46:46.958 --> 46:48.333
-[Justin] Great. Bye.
-Bye.

46:51.041 --> 46:54.708
[door closes] You know,
it is very funny when you have, like,

46:54.833 --> 46:58.041
this amount of books,
and I've only read one-tenth of them.

46:59.916 --> 47:02.833
So, Justin was telling me
that half of the class is going to stay

47:02.916 --> 47:04.916
for the next semester.
Would you like to stay?

47:06.041 --> 47:08.166
-Yes, I would.
-That would be great, right?

47:08.416 --> 47:09.375
-Yeah.
-Good.

47:09.875 --> 47:13.333
So tell me about you. I don't know
anything about you. What do you do?

47:13.583 --> 47:14.458
I teach.

47:14.958 --> 47:15.791
You teach?

47:16.250 --> 47:18.791
I want to thank you for inviting me.

47:18.875 --> 47:21.625
I can't tell you how flattered I was
when I received your email.

47:21.708 --> 47:23.583
Oh, please. No. I mean...

47:24.541 --> 47:25.916
You know your work has been...

47:26.041 --> 47:28.333
progressing a lot,
and it was a no-brainer.

47:28.416 --> 47:29.875
I mean you have to come.

47:31.500 --> 47:32.583
So what do you teach?

47:33.166 --> 47:34.291
I teach kindergarten.

47:35.416 --> 47:37.291
That's such a delicate thing, right?

47:39.250 --> 47:41.833
I mean, you give the kids something
and then they...

47:43.125 --> 47:44.250
they have it forever.

47:45.458 --> 47:46.583
-Yeah.
-It's incredible.

47:46.666 --> 47:47.500
That's true.

47:49.125 --> 47:50.833
So... Um...

47:51.500 --> 47:52.541
on Thursday night...

47:53.625 --> 47:54.500
at the Bowery...

47:55.625 --> 47:57.583
we're doing this reading where...

47:57.916 --> 48:00.208
you know, a bunch of poets come in.

48:00.458 --> 48:02.791
It's very eclectic. Young and old.

48:03.166 --> 48:06.875
And there's reviewers, publishers as well,
there might be.

48:07.291 --> 48:10.583
And everyone that goes on stage
reads two poems.

48:10.708 --> 48:12.916
So you have to prepare two poems
that you like.

48:13.000 --> 48:13.958
-Okay.
-Alright?

48:14.750 --> 48:17.166
I really want to thank you
for this opportunity.

48:18.791 --> 48:19.666
Of course.

48:21.041 --> 48:22.375
There's dancing afterwards...

48:22.500 --> 48:23.333
with poets.

48:23.541 --> 48:26.666
You know, there's going to be a party
with drinks and stuff, but...

48:26.750 --> 48:28.125
I don't know, maybe you...

48:29.416 --> 48:31.375
you will be like a center of attention.

48:33.125 --> 48:35.125
[Lisa laughs]

48:45.125 --> 48:49.125
I am sorry. I'm sorry.
[grunts] My God, I'm sorry.

48:49.375 --> 48:50.916
I'm very sorry.

48:51.708 --> 48:52.708
I'm sorry. I just...

48:53.541 --> 48:55.083
It's presumptuous of me...

48:56.541 --> 48:57.416
I'm sorry.

49:00.708 --> 49:01.583
Forget about it.

49:04.916 --> 49:06.333
Can I read you a poem?

49:08.083 --> 49:08.916
Yeah.

49:12.541 --> 49:14.333
I wrote it sort of quickly.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.625
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

49:19.833 --> 49:20.666
Okay.

49:20.791 --> 49:22.791
[police siren]

49:29.000 --> 49:31.083
Mesmerize Me, Butterfly.

49:32.250 --> 49:35.083
Forcing wings open-shut

49:36.125 --> 49:39.375
Thrust with purpose not known to me

49:39.791 --> 49:42.250
Not expert in your grasses

49:43.250 --> 49:44.291
In poison

49:45.250 --> 49:48.083
Mushrooms camouflage deliverance

49:49.375 --> 49:52.375
Today the garden teems with wood sprites

49:52.458 --> 49:53.500
Flashing blue

49:53.750 --> 49:54.750
Now white

49:55.250 --> 49:56.791
At the edge of seeing.

50:02.458 --> 50:03.291
It's good.

50:03.958 --> 50:04.791
Yeah?

50:04.916 --> 50:06.166
Yeah, that was very cool.

50:06.750 --> 50:09.583
It's not my favorite, that you've written,
but it's nice.

50:14.083 --> 50:15.666
You know, at the beginning,

50:16.708 --> 50:19.625
when you came into the class,
I didn't notice you at first.

50:20.166 --> 50:22.166
There's so many people, you know, and...

50:22.666 --> 50:24.291
Also, you were very quiet for a while.

50:24.625 --> 50:26.625
Then you started to present your work.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.333
But, I mean, I must say,
don't take this wrong,

50:29.416 --> 50:32.333
but at the beginning,
your work was very typical, you know?

50:32.416 --> 50:33.250
Like, all the...

50:34.083 --> 50:35.625
all the metaphors were very...

50:36.250 --> 50:38.291
kind of commonplace,
which is normal because you're...

50:38.375 --> 50:41.291
just experimenting with the nature
of all of this.

50:41.708 --> 50:43.958
But when you read your poem about Anna.

50:45.083 --> 50:47.625
Then, I thought,
okay, there is a poet here.

50:50.125 --> 50:51.708
And from then on, I was just...

50:53.250 --> 50:54.083
I don't know.

50:56.833 --> 50:57.666
I wonder what...

50:58.333 --> 50:59.583
what's going on with you.

51:02.416 --> 51:03.541
[Lisa chuckles]

51:08.541 --> 51:10.083
Are you going out with Anna?

51:14.416 --> 51:15.250
No.

51:19.333 --> 51:20.291
Do you like women?

51:22.875 --> 51:23.750
Occasionally.

51:37.541 --> 51:39.541
[both moaning]

52:17.958 --> 52:19.958
[children playing]

52:39.625 --> 52:40.500
Hey.

52:41.083 --> 52:41.916
Come with me.

52:46.750 --> 52:47.708
[teacher] Is he okay?

52:48.125 --> 52:49.166
Yeah. Of course.

52:55.958 --> 52:57.125
Yeah, let's go in here.

53:10.041 --> 53:11.791
So, on Thursday,

53:13.166 --> 53:14.666
we've been invited to a place

53:14.750 --> 53:17.666
where poets read their poems
on stage, like this,

53:19.083 --> 53:20.291
in front of an audience.

53:21.833 --> 53:24.000
Some of them will probably be
pretty mediocre, but...

53:25.250 --> 53:28.083
I was wondering if you might want to read
a few of yours.

53:32.208 --> 53:33.125
What do you think?

53:36.833 --> 53:37.791
Yeah, I'd like to.

53:41.125 --> 53:43.125
I think it would be a great opportunity.

53:44.416 --> 53:46.416
[takes deep breath]

53:49.250 --> 53:51.166
Actually, why don't you stand up here.

53:55.833 --> 53:56.666
Yeah.

53:57.291 --> 53:58.250
Like a stage.

54:00.625 --> 54:03.083
Can you show me how you say
one of your poems?

54:05.375 --> 54:06.333
Maybe "Anna"?

54:09.916 --> 54:11.916
Anna's beautiful

54:12.291 --> 54:13.875
Beautiful enough for me

54:21.541 --> 54:22.791
You know what's in there?

54:23.875 --> 54:24.708
What?

54:24.833 --> 54:25.708
Your heart.

54:27.125 --> 54:29.041
Can you try saying it more from there?

54:29.958 --> 54:30.833
From your heart?

54:33.666 --> 54:34.541
Anna's

54:34.916 --> 54:35.750
beautiful

54:36.125 --> 54:37.583
Beautiful enough for me.

54:38.333 --> 54:41.291
The sun hits her yellow house.

54:41.625 --> 54:43.958
It's almost like a sign from God.

54:49.625 --> 54:50.458
Okay, good.

54:52.708 --> 54:55.875
So, on Thursday we'll do "Anna" and...

54:56.083 --> 54:57.166
how about "The Bull"?

54:57.333 --> 54:58.166
Yeah.

54:58.250 --> 55:00.833
And we'll practice
both of them a little bit every day.

55:01.250 --> 55:02.083
Okay.

55:03.625 --> 55:05.625
[takes deep breath]

55:07.166 --> 55:09.166
-[police siren]
-[traffic noises]

55:11.583 --> 55:13.583
[music pumping loud]

55:36.750 --> 55:37.708
Mr. Roy.

55:39.000 --> 55:39.833
Yes.

55:40.916 --> 55:42.541
[pouring ice in a glass]

55:42.666 --> 55:43.500
So...

55:44.958 --> 55:46.583
I've got a kid with a good head.

55:47.000 --> 55:47.833
I'm happy.

55:48.041 --> 55:49.291
Well it's more than that.

55:50.500 --> 55:52.291
I think we have a young Mozart.

55:53.125 --> 55:54.000
He's gifted,

55:54.666 --> 55:55.500
Mr. Roy.

55:56.791 --> 55:59.291
He writes poetry on a level that is far...

55:59.916 --> 56:01.583
beyond his age.

56:01.708 --> 56:03.708
[music playing]

56:04.833 --> 56:06.208
Have you talked to Sanjay?

56:06.916 --> 56:07.916
Sanjay who?

56:08.250 --> 56:09.666
Your brother, the writer.

56:10.375 --> 56:14.333
[laughs] The writer?
Haven't talked to him in a month.

56:14.958 --> 56:16.875
I see. He was supposed to call you.

56:17.541 --> 56:18.958
What can I do for you, Lisa?

56:19.291 --> 56:20.583
Mozart...

56:21.208 --> 56:23.791
was nurtured by Kings and Queens.

56:24.916 --> 56:28.583
They massaged his tired hands.
They fed him candy...

56:29.250 --> 56:30.625
while he played the piano.

56:31.833 --> 56:33.166
And Jimmy doesn't have that.

56:33.416 --> 56:36.500
I'm not saying he should be spoiled,
but he does need support.

56:37.583 --> 56:38.583
And Becca,

56:40.125 --> 56:41.000
she's nice.

56:42.541 --> 56:44.541
But she's not a good influence on him.

56:45.708 --> 56:46.750
[Father of Jimmy] Why?

56:47.250 --> 56:50.458
Well, I think she treats him
like any stupid child.

56:51.083 --> 56:52.833
She talks to him like a puppy dog.

56:53.625 --> 56:57.416
And I should tell you she's often late
picking him up and dropping him off.

56:57.791 --> 56:58.625
Is that true?

56:59.125 --> 57:00.041
Yes.

57:01.416 --> 57:04.541
Last week, she was an hour late
because she was at an audition.

57:06.041 --> 57:08.500
I know. I see you're very busy and...

57:08.958 --> 57:12.041
that you're a very successful man,
and that you don't have a lot of time.

57:12.125 --> 57:14.125
And I know
that Jimmy's mother isn't around.

57:14.208 --> 57:17.583
I want to help my son.
Especially if he enjoys doing this.

57:17.875 --> 57:19.875
But, I don't want him
to be like my brother.

57:20.333 --> 57:21.375
You met him, right?

57:21.875 --> 57:25.625
Forty two years old. Makes 50 grand a year
because he wanted to be an intellectual.

57:26.666 --> 57:27.500
Now?

57:27.750 --> 57:29.958
Corrects spelling mistakes
for the newspaper.

57:30.333 --> 57:33.583
I want my son to do good in school.
I want him to be smart, but...

57:34.125 --> 57:36.041
it's also good to have a normal life.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.250
Make money, be practical.

57:39.833 --> 57:42.916
But you know I don't like this Becca
forgetting to pick him up.

57:43.916 --> 57:45.541
I'm going to ask her to leave.

57:45.916 --> 57:47.750
I knew it wasn't going to work,
but, you know,

57:47.833 --> 57:50.375
whenever this happens,
it's a real problem for me because...

57:50.458 --> 57:51.291
who watches him?

57:51.583 --> 57:52.583
I'm happy to.

57:53.333 --> 57:54.458
It's not hard for me.

57:54.541 --> 57:56.708
Especially if it's a few hours
after school.

57:57.416 --> 57:58.250
Yeah.

57:59.041 --> 58:00.791
-That would help me very much.
-Okay.

58:00.875 --> 58:03.541
At least until 5 or 6. Then I could get
a girl to come to the house.

58:03.625 --> 58:04.500
Yes, I can do that.

58:05.458 --> 58:06.291
And...

58:06.583 --> 58:09.458
I don't know if Jimmy mentioned it
to you, but I've asked him to recite

58:09.541 --> 58:14.166
a few of his poems in Manhattan
on Thursday night at a poetry reading.

58:14.875 --> 58:15.708
See now,

58:15.791 --> 58:18.791
on Thursday he has baseball practice
with his friend. They go together.

58:19.208 --> 58:21.625
So, forget it. It's too complicated.

58:23.083 --> 58:23.958
I see.

58:25.916 --> 58:27.916
Do you need me to bring him to baseball?

58:28.708 --> 58:32.125
Oh, no. They've got it arranged.
The father of the kid takes him.

58:35.333 --> 58:36.250
It's a shame...

58:37.416 --> 58:39.291
that he won't be able to go
to the reading.

58:39.375 --> 58:40.666
Don't overthink it.

58:40.750 --> 58:42.625
They need things simple at this age.

58:43.083 --> 58:45.083
[piano playing]

59:04.833 --> 59:06.250
[cell phone buzzes]

59:06.875 --> 59:08.041
You know what?

59:08.125 --> 59:09.541
Let's turn our phones off.

59:10.208 --> 59:11.375
And then we can just...

59:11.916 --> 59:13.041
look at the art,

59:13.333 --> 59:15.333
not worry about anything else.

59:48.833 --> 59:49.666
Hi.

59:51.291 --> 59:53.166
[woman] I tried to call three times.

59:54.750 --> 59:56.083
Come on, honey. Let's go.

1:00:02.708 --> 1:00:03.666
[closes car door]

1:00:11.958 --> 1:00:13.916
Anna is beautiful

1:00:14.625 --> 1:00:16.583
Beautiful enough for me.

1:00:17.583 --> 1:00:20.041
The sun hits her yellow house

1:00:20.541 --> 1:00:23.583
It's almost like a sign from God.

1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:26.833
That was great, Jimmy.

1:00:27.875 --> 1:00:29.750
Do it just like that tonight, okay?

1:00:30.875 --> 1:00:32.000
Okay. Now...

1:00:33.208 --> 1:00:34.958
I'm going to be somebody in the audience,

1:00:35.041 --> 1:00:37.041
and I'm going to pretend
to ask you a question, okay?

1:00:37.125 --> 1:00:38.166
I'm going to raise my hand.

1:00:39.041 --> 1:00:40.833
Mr. Jimmy Roy.

1:00:42.833 --> 1:00:43.666
Who is Anna?

1:00:45.291 --> 1:00:46.750
And then you have to answer.

1:00:48.375 --> 1:00:50.041
So, you can say...

1:00:52.958 --> 1:00:55.916
You can say
Anna is a little tweeting bird.

1:00:56.875 --> 1:00:58.125
Or you can say

1:00:58.208 --> 1:01:00.291
she's one of the little girls
in our kindergarten.

1:01:00.375 --> 1:01:01.916
Or you can say she's the moon,

1:01:02.125 --> 1:01:03.666
or a star or...

1:01:05.083 --> 1:01:06.791
you can say whatever you want.

1:01:14.666 --> 1:01:15.708
[Lisa] Hi, Richard.

1:01:15.791 --> 1:01:16.625
[Richard] Hey.

1:01:17.041 --> 1:01:18.833
-[Lisa] Can I talk to you for a sec?
-Sure.

1:01:18.916 --> 1:01:19.833
[Lisa] Okay, great.

1:01:21.208 --> 1:01:22.041
So...

1:01:22.250 --> 1:01:24.250
Jimmy was really not feeling well today.

1:01:24.333 --> 1:01:26.833
I think maybe it's best
if he skips baseball.

1:01:27.541 --> 1:01:28.791
[Richard] That's fine with me.

1:01:28.875 --> 1:01:30.541
Better he's not running around
in the heat.

1:01:30.916 --> 1:01:33.166
Does Nikhil need me to take him
to the doctor?

1:01:33.833 --> 1:01:35.625
You know, I just spoke to him.

1:01:35.958 --> 1:01:37.708
I'm happy to keep Jimmy tonight.

1:01:37.791 --> 1:01:41.166
I was just concerned because I know
you've got two other babes in the house.

1:01:41.250 --> 1:01:43.750
And I wouldn't want him
to get everyone else sick.

1:01:43.833 --> 1:01:45.875
[Richard]
Alright. As long as Nikhil's fine with it.

1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:47.875
[Lisa]
He agreed it would probably be better.

1:01:47.958 --> 1:01:50.458
-Thanks, Lisa.
-Okay. Alright, see you tomorrow.

1:01:53.875 --> 1:01:55.875
[people chattering]

1:02:13.166 --> 1:02:15.208
[woman recites poem]
Who you think you're talking to?

1:02:15.416 --> 1:02:18.916
Don't you know I'm the reason why you
can't shut any wet part of your face?

1:02:19.041 --> 1:02:21.500
While all the badass hurricanes struck
a woman's fame,

1:02:21.583 --> 1:02:23.458
I put God in my hands, snapped.

1:02:23.791 --> 1:02:24.875
Watched it rain.

1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.375
Skid my teeth across the thin skin
of my full lip

1:02:27.458 --> 1:02:29.375
Just to usher the sun in, so yeah.

1:02:29.458 --> 1:02:30.916
I make you dog pant.

1:02:31.041 --> 1:02:33.916
Make you beg big. But I'm also
the reason you hallelujah.

1:02:34.125 --> 1:02:37.166
Just as much life I've given you,
I can take it away.

1:02:37.250 --> 1:02:38.250
Calling me bitch?

1:02:38.333 --> 1:02:42.166
Only sharpens my blade, only makes me want
to watch you gargle your own tongue.

1:02:42.250 --> 1:02:43.083
I've been a killer.

1:02:43.166 --> 1:02:45.291
Baby, I keep caskets warm,

1:02:45.375 --> 1:02:47.666
God in business.
I parade into rooms

1:02:47.791 --> 1:02:50.291
And the wallpaper don't even
stand up no more.

1:02:50.375 --> 1:02:52.625
My pussy be hurricane season
so the next time

1:02:52.750 --> 1:02:54.375
You see me walk in a room,

1:02:54.541 --> 1:02:58.083
Out a room, up the block.
Shit, down the block, just say Amen.

1:02:58.541 --> 1:03:00.250
Like I'm the answer to the sky.

1:03:02.458 --> 1:03:04.750
[audience applaudes and cheers]

1:03:21.041 --> 1:03:23.125
Hi, this is Jimmy Roy

1:03:23.208 --> 1:03:26.666
and he'll be reciting two poems
for you tonight.

1:03:35.875 --> 1:03:37.875
[Jimmy starts reciting]

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.666
Anna is beautiful.

1:03:40.791 --> 1:03:42.375
Beautiful enough for me.

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.875
The sun hits her yellow house

1:03:46.583 --> 1:03:49.791
It's almost like a sign from God.

1:03:55.291 --> 1:03:56.250
The Bull.

1:03:57.541 --> 1:04:00.333
The bull stood alone in the backyard.

1:04:01.083 --> 1:04:05.250
So dark.
I opened the door and stepped out.

1:04:05.583 --> 1:04:07.708
Wind in the branches.

1:04:08.083 --> 1:04:09.041
He watch me.

1:04:09.416 --> 1:04:10.583
Blue eyes.

1:04:11.041 --> 1:04:13.541
He kept breathing to stay alive.

1:04:13.750 --> 1:04:16.583
I didn't want him.
I was just a boy.

1:04:17.458 --> 1:04:18.666
Say yes.

1:04:19.666 --> 1:04:22.041
Say yes, anyway.

1:04:23.541 --> 1:04:25.541
[audience applauding and murmuring]

1:04:30.583 --> 1:04:33.750
[man] I'm sorry to ask
such a basic question, but...

1:04:34.041 --> 1:04:36.375
are these your poems, and if so,

1:04:36.458 --> 1:04:40.125
are you using him
as a sort of poetic medium?

1:04:44.083 --> 1:04:45.916
No, these are his poems.

1:04:46.625 --> 1:04:47.458
He wrote them.

1:04:48.208 --> 1:04:51.541
-[audience applauding]
-[man] Bravo!

1:04:55.333 --> 1:04:57.500
[man] For the... young man.

1:04:57.916 --> 1:04:59.875
How long have you been writing poetry?

1:05:01.041 --> 1:05:03.291
I started when I was five.

1:05:03.416 --> 1:05:05.416
[audience laughing]

1:05:06.041 --> 1:05:06.916
Jimmy?

1:05:07.208 --> 1:05:10.333
I was wondering who is this Anna
that you write about.

1:05:12.166 --> 1:05:14.166
Anna could be...

1:05:14.500 --> 1:05:15.625
anyone you love.

1:05:17.250 --> 1:05:20.708
For me, she's my kindergarten teacher's
helper, Meghan.

1:05:20.875 --> 1:05:22.875
[audience murmuring]

1:05:23.125 --> 1:05:25.125
[audience applauding and cheering]

1:05:39.833 --> 1:05:41.833
Jacket's tight on my arms.

1:05:42.500 --> 1:05:43.708
I want to take it off.

1:05:46.875 --> 1:05:49.791
[Lisa sniffles and sighs]

1:05:52.625 --> 1:05:54.208
Why are you upset?

1:05:57.500 --> 1:05:58.333
I'm not.

1:06:00.166 --> 1:06:01.833
Just emotional because...

1:06:02.166 --> 1:06:04.875
I'm so proud of you.
You did such a beautiful job.

1:06:06.708 --> 1:06:08.041
They clapped for me.

1:06:11.750 --> 1:06:13.208
[whimpers]

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:20.250
[sniffles] They loved it.

1:06:24.333 --> 1:06:27.583
[sniffles] Jimmy can you wait outside
for me for a minute?

1:06:30.125 --> 1:06:32.625
[whimpers] Just wait right there,
right outside the door.

1:06:37.125 --> 1:06:39.125
[starts crying]

1:06:43.291 --> 1:06:46.083
[sniffles and sighs]

1:06:47.500 --> 1:06:49.500
-[people chattering]
-[music playing]

1:06:54.250 --> 1:06:55.125
Jimmy?

1:07:13.666 --> 1:07:14.541
Hi, Jimmy.

1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:24.000
He's incredible, isn't he?

1:07:26.500 --> 1:07:28.583
I think you should leave the class, Lisa.

1:07:30.250 --> 1:07:31.500
I'm uncomfortable with the fact

1:07:31.583 --> 1:07:33.666
that you're presenting work
that is not your own.

1:07:35.416 --> 1:07:36.250
Okay.

1:07:38.291 --> 1:07:40.916
All artists take from each other.
But what you're doing,

1:07:41.833 --> 1:07:42.958
I don't know.

1:07:43.208 --> 1:07:44.458
It's something different.

1:07:45.541 --> 1:07:47.000
You're leeching off a child.

1:07:48.583 --> 1:07:51.083
I'm so sorry that you see it that way.

1:07:51.708 --> 1:07:54.541
You break the whole trust
that goes into a classroom.

1:07:54.625 --> 1:07:55.583
The whole ethic.

1:07:56.833 --> 1:07:59.791
I don't see what's the point?
I was excited about you, Lisa.

1:08:01.166 --> 1:08:02.625
Well, this is about him.

1:08:03.125 --> 1:08:05.125
No, it is very unclear what you're doing.

1:08:07.958 --> 1:08:09.791
What's clear is that you're not an artist.

1:08:11.416 --> 1:08:13.791
You're just an art appreciator.

1:08:14.083 --> 1:08:15.000
A dilettante.

1:08:17.958 --> 1:08:19.833
It's very different. Don't you think?

1:09:14.750 --> 1:09:16.750
[high-heels dropping on floor]

1:09:37.583 --> 1:09:39.708
-[Lisa sighs]
-Where have you been?

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.791
[Lisa whispers] The reading went late.

1:09:51.041 --> 1:09:53.041
[Grant sighs]

1:09:56.541 --> 1:09:57.541
It went okay?

1:09:57.791 --> 1:09:58.708
Yeah.

1:10:05.833 --> 1:10:07.833
[Lisa sighs]

1:10:09.333 --> 1:10:11.041
Are you proud of the kids, Lis?

1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:18.083
What do you mean? Our kids?

1:10:22.541 --> 1:10:24.250
Josh said the other day that...

1:10:27.625 --> 1:10:30.125
he thought
you seemed disappointed in them.

1:10:38.458 --> 1:10:39.500
[Lisa huffs]

1:10:41.583 --> 1:10:42.458
No.

1:10:43.791 --> 1:10:44.625
Of course not.

1:10:51.416 --> 1:10:53.416
-[Grant] Okay.
-[Lisa sighs]

1:11:05.666 --> 1:11:07.416
X-ing X's.

1:11:09.208 --> 1:11:10.958
X-ing X.

1:11:15.083 --> 1:11:15.916
Jimmy,

1:11:16.083 --> 1:11:17.833
it's Lisa, where are you?

1:11:18.541 --> 1:11:19.708
Are you sick?

1:11:19.875 --> 1:11:20.708
I hope not.

1:11:20.875 --> 1:11:24.708
I don't even know if I need to
take care of you this afternoon.

1:11:26.375 --> 1:11:27.750
So can you please call me?

1:11:28.458 --> 1:11:29.875
Let me know what's going on?

1:11:30.041 --> 1:11:32.041
[chattering]

1:11:32.208 --> 1:11:33.041
Okay, bye.

1:11:35.166 --> 1:11:37.166
[children chattering]

1:11:46.583 --> 1:11:48.583
[cell phone buzzes]

1:11:50.916 --> 1:11:51.750
Hi, Jimmy.

1:11:56.083 --> 1:11:58.250
Mr. Roy. Let me just...

1:11:58.375 --> 1:12:00.500
Let me just find a place
where we can talk.

1:12:03.791 --> 1:12:04.750
Nikhil.

1:12:04.875 --> 1:12:06.541
Nikhil, listen to me.

1:12:06.666 --> 1:12:09.250
Listen for a second.
Nobody's fighting with you.

1:12:09.833 --> 1:12:13.041
I did it in the name of his talent.

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:18.500
No. It wasn't a bar. It was a poetry club.

1:12:22.125 --> 1:12:22.958
Okay.

1:12:23.416 --> 1:12:24.416
Okay. Yes.

1:12:26.375 --> 1:12:27.375
I do under--

1:12:27.458 --> 1:12:30.416
I do. I thought it was very late,

1:12:31.125 --> 1:12:33.916
and that it made much more sense
for him to spend the night.

1:12:37.166 --> 1:12:38.000
Well, I--

1:12:40.458 --> 1:12:42.458
I think you're reacting very strongly,

1:12:42.958 --> 1:12:45.208
but of course you're entitled
to your opinion.

1:12:51.708 --> 1:12:54.708
Yes, I should have asked
for your permission and I'm sorry.

1:13:03.875 --> 1:13:04.708
Meghan.

1:13:05.833 --> 1:13:06.833
Is everything okay?

1:13:07.750 --> 1:13:09.291
Yeah, that was Jimmy's dad.

1:13:10.916 --> 1:13:13.791
He's leaving us. He's going to go
to another kindergarten.

1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.291
That's too bad.

1:13:19.125 --> 1:13:20.166
Sorry to hear that.

1:13:20.375 --> 1:13:22.000
Okay, everybody,

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.625
let's have some snacks.

1:13:25.708 --> 1:13:27.708
[children talking]

1:13:30.333 --> 1:13:31.166
[girl] Me too.

1:13:32.166 --> 1:13:33.791
[boy] Gluten-free.

1:13:33.875 --> 1:13:35.875
[other kids talking]

1:13:36.083 --> 1:13:37.541
[girl] I need a big one.

1:13:37.625 --> 1:13:39.625
[Lisa starts whimpering]

1:13:49.500 --> 1:13:50.333
Hi.

1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:51.333
Hey.

1:13:51.500 --> 1:13:52.333
Who's here?

1:13:52.708 --> 1:13:54.416
-We're all here.
-Good.

1:13:56.291 --> 1:13:57.333
I was thinking...

1:13:57.791 --> 1:13:59.875
I would cook a big dinner tonight
for everyone.

1:13:59.958 --> 1:14:02.166
I went to the market.
I got some great stuff.

1:14:03.333 --> 1:14:04.333
Mwah!

1:14:04.416 --> 1:14:05.916
Honey, you're sweaty.

1:14:07.541 --> 1:14:08.708
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:14:15.166 --> 1:14:16.000
Josh?

1:14:17.333 --> 1:14:18.208
Okay.

1:14:21.208 --> 1:14:22.041
Lainey?

1:14:24.708 --> 1:14:25.541
Hey.

1:14:25.958 --> 1:14:27.250
I got some great food.

1:14:27.333 --> 1:14:29.541
I was hoping we could have dinner
together tonight.

1:14:29.666 --> 1:14:32.875
I sort of can't. I'm supposed to go
to Kelly's to study for Bio.

1:14:33.250 --> 1:14:34.458
Well, can you go after?

1:14:37.583 --> 1:14:41.000
Hey, I would really appreciate it if we
could sit down and have a meal together,

1:14:41.083 --> 1:14:42.750
just once like a normal family.

1:14:43.625 --> 1:14:44.958
It's been a long time.

1:14:46.541 --> 1:14:47.375
Okay.

1:14:47.458 --> 1:14:48.291
I'll tell Josh.

1:14:49.500 --> 1:14:50.833
But can I leave at 7:30?

1:14:52.166 --> 1:14:53.000
Yeah.

1:14:56.125 --> 1:14:56.958
Mom?

1:14:58.958 --> 1:15:00.916
Sorry I got so upset with you
the other night.

1:15:01.875 --> 1:15:04.166
Probably could have worded that
a little bit better.

1:15:04.458 --> 1:15:05.666
Came off kind of bitchy.

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:10.833
It's okay.

1:15:16.833 --> 1:15:18.291
[Lisa] How was your meeting?

1:15:18.916 --> 1:15:19.916
[Josh] It was fine.

1:15:20.833 --> 1:15:23.291
There are actually
so many benefits to joining up.

1:15:23.375 --> 1:15:25.625
They'll even pay for a year of my college.

1:15:26.166 --> 1:15:28.166
[placing plates]

1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:29.833
Okay.

1:15:32.041 --> 1:15:33.000
[Josh] You don't mind?

1:15:42.416 --> 1:15:44.416
[birds chirping]

1:16:06.416 --> 1:16:07.583
[sighs]

1:16:15.833 --> 1:16:18.208

1:16:18.875 --> 1:16:20.875
[takes deep breath]

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000
[starts moaning]

1:16:25.291 --> 1:16:28.375
-[Grant breathes heavily]
-[Lisa continues to kiss him]

1:16:40.208 --> 1:16:41.416
Have a good day.

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.000
[music playing]

1:17:59.666 --> 1:18:01.666
[children playing]

1:18:27.916 --> 1:18:28.791
Hey, Jimmy.

1:18:42.208 --> 1:18:43.041
Hi.

1:18:43.500 --> 1:18:44.333
Hi.

1:18:46.041 --> 1:18:48.208
It's so hot today.
I thought maybe we could go swimming.

1:18:48.291 --> 1:18:49.208
You know how to swim?

1:18:49.625 --> 1:18:50.458
Yes.

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:52.875
Turn that.

1:18:53.250 --> 1:18:54.500
Push it to the left.

1:18:59.208 --> 1:19:01.208
[gate grinds]

1:19:05.458 --> 1:19:06.708
I missed you.

1:19:45.416 --> 1:19:48.791
Where we're driving, up North,
is so beautiful.

1:19:49.208 --> 1:19:50.833
Big mountains.

1:19:51.750 --> 1:19:54.583
A lake you can swim in.
Have you ever done that before?

1:19:55.708 --> 1:19:58.125
No. I've only been in a pool.

1:20:01.166 --> 1:20:02.625
But I like to swim.

1:20:07.916 --> 1:20:10.166
[Jimmy]
How long are we going swimming for?

1:20:12.583 --> 1:20:14.166
[Lisa] As long as we want.

1:20:29.208 --> 1:20:31.208
[sea hitting the shore]

1:20:31.500 --> 1:20:33.500
-[squelching]
-[kids laughing]

1:20:33.833 --> 1:20:35.833
[Lisa moans]

1:20:43.541 --> 1:20:45.541
[birds tweeting]

1:20:59.708 --> 1:21:01.833
You want to swim like the other kids?

1:21:02.750 --> 1:21:04.083
Come on. I'll go with you.

1:21:12.083 --> 1:21:13.000
Alright.

1:21:35.375 --> 1:21:36.833
[Jimmy laughs]

1:21:48.708 --> 1:21:50.708
[Jimmy spatters]

1:21:59.083 --> 1:22:01.083
-[coughs]
-You want to make a wish?

1:22:01.250 --> 1:22:03.250
[Jimmy blows]

1:22:10.416 --> 1:22:11.875
I have a poem.

1:22:15.500 --> 1:22:16.458
[Lisa pants] Okay.

1:22:17.041 --> 1:22:18.750
Come. Let's move in a little.

1:22:24.833 --> 1:22:26.541
Anna, get up.

1:22:27.458 --> 1:22:28.333
Remember

1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.875
Loneliness is still time spent

1:22:32.041 --> 1:22:33.166
With the world.

1:22:36.666 --> 1:22:39.166
Here's the room with everyone in it.

1:22:40.416 --> 1:22:42.875
Your dead friends passing through you

1:22:43.666 --> 1:22:46.000
Like wind
Through a wind chime.

1:22:47.333 --> 1:22:49.166
Don't be afraid, Anna.

1:22:50.208 --> 1:22:52.625
The end of the road is so far ahead

1:22:53.750 --> 1:22:55.000
It is already

1:22:56.041 --> 1:22:57.458
Behind us.

1:22:58.333 --> 1:23:00.333
[Jimmy squelches]

1:23:04.291 --> 1:23:05.833
[sobs] Oh, Jimmy.

1:23:18.791 --> 1:23:20.791
[door closes]

1:23:25.083 --> 1:23:27.083
[thunders crashing]

1:23:40.791 --> 1:23:42.458
[Lisa] It's beautiful, isn't it?

1:23:44.333 --> 1:23:45.916
So different from home.

1:23:46.666 --> 1:23:48.208
[Jimmy] It's beautiful...

1:23:48.666 --> 1:23:50.500
and sad-looking too.

1:23:52.041 --> 1:23:52.875
[Lisa] Yeah.

1:23:53.833 --> 1:23:55.333
Sadness never ends.

1:23:57.583 --> 1:23:59.458
Van Gough said that before he died.

1:24:00.041 --> 1:24:02.041
[rain pattering]

1:24:08.125 --> 1:24:08.958
[Lisa] Okay.

1:24:09.541 --> 1:24:10.916
Go get cleaned up, alright?

1:24:11.416 --> 1:24:13.208
You're covered in sand and dirt.

1:24:15.625 --> 1:24:17.625
[unzips suitcase]

1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:20.833
Go ahead.

1:24:25.375 --> 1:24:27.625
[opens and closes bathroom door]

1:24:28.958 --> 1:24:30.958
[squeaks]

1:24:31.166 --> 1:24:33.166
[shower pouring]

1:24:38.583 --> 1:24:39.458
Hey, Jimmy.

1:24:40.625 --> 1:24:42.250
Are you okay with the hot water?

1:24:59.083 --> 1:25:01.083
-[thunder crashes]
-[rain pours]

1:25:06.708 --> 1:25:08.708
[door opens]

1:25:18.166 --> 1:25:19.875
I'm going to go get washed up too.

1:25:25.875 --> 1:25:27.125
[closes door]

1:25:36.375 --> 1:25:38.375
[shower pouring]

1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000
[Lisa sighs]

1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.333
[door locks]

1:25:57.708 --> 1:25:58.541
Jimmy?

1:26:04.458 --> 1:26:05.291
Jimmy?

1:26:12.833 --> 1:26:14.583
Hey, Jimmy, did you lock the door?

1:26:15.166 --> 1:26:16.000
Yes.

1:26:17.875 --> 1:26:18.750
On purpose?

1:26:19.916 --> 1:26:20.750
Yes.

1:26:23.875 --> 1:26:25.791
Hey, Jimmy, sweetie. Open the door.

1:26:26.833 --> 1:26:29.750
You know how much I care about you.
I love you so much.

1:26:29.833 --> 1:26:31.750
This whole trip was planned for you.

1:26:34.333 --> 1:26:35.416
Open the door, baby.

1:26:39.583 --> 1:26:40.416
Jimmy.

1:26:42.750 --> 1:26:43.958
Listen, tomorrow...

1:26:44.041 --> 1:26:47.416
we're going to go back to the lake
and we're going to get ice cream.

1:26:48.500 --> 1:26:49.541
And then,

1:26:51.416 --> 1:26:53.500
we're going to drive across the border...

1:26:54.375 --> 1:26:56.458
and you're going to recite your poems...

1:26:57.041 --> 1:26:58.541
and I'm going to write them down.

1:26:58.625 --> 1:27:01.583
And we're going to publish a book
that has your name on it.

1:27:02.583 --> 1:27:03.916
Just think about that.

1:27:09.500 --> 1:27:12.083
Hello, I've been kidnapped.
Can you help me?

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000
[sniffles]

1:27:18.375 --> 1:27:21.250
Hey, Jimmy,
if you want to call the police,

1:27:21.416 --> 1:27:24.708
you have to dial 9-1-1.

1:27:26.750 --> 1:27:28.750
[dialing]

1:27:28.958 --> 1:27:30.666
[line beeping]

1:27:30.791 --> 1:27:33.041
-[operator] 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-You know, Jimmy,

1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:36.500
this world is going to erase you.

1:27:39.291 --> 1:27:41.500
There's not a place in this world for you.

1:27:42.958 --> 1:27:45.000
For people like you, [sniffles]

1:27:45.291 --> 1:27:47.625
...couple of years, you were gonna be...

1:27:48.083 --> 1:27:50.500
just a shadow, just like me.

1:27:53.541 --> 1:27:54.791
[starts crying] Shit.

1:27:56.708 --> 1:27:57.708
[sniffles]

1:27:59.916 --> 1:28:01.750
No, she's in the shower.

1:28:02.250 --> 1:28:04.791
[operator] Okay. Where are you?
Have you come here before?

1:28:05.541 --> 1:28:06.750
[Lisa crying]

1:28:06.875 --> 1:28:07.916
[operator] Jimmy?

1:28:08.666 --> 1:28:11.333
I'm in a place with lots of beach trees.

1:28:11.583 --> 1:28:13.375
[operator] Okay. Can you...

1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000
[Jimmy] Yes, I'm near Canada.

1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:25.791
Jimmy, tell them you're
at Placid Oaks Motel, Room 114.

1:28:27.416 --> 1:28:29.625
And tell them I don't have a weapon.

1:28:30.583 --> 1:28:34.958
[Jimmy]
I'm in Placid Oaks Motel, Room 114...

1:28:36.041 --> 1:28:38.125
and she doesn't have a weapon.

1:28:42.416 --> 1:28:43.833
[Lisa] What did they say?

1:28:45.791 --> 1:28:48.958
[Jimmy] They said to hang tight
and they'll be here soon.

1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:56.208
[sniffles]

1:28:57.250 --> 1:28:58.750
[starts crying]

1:28:59.291 --> 1:29:00.333
Hey, Jimmy.

1:29:01.583 --> 1:29:03.625
Can you open the door, please?

1:29:04.541 --> 1:29:06.333
I'd like to get my clothes on...

1:29:07.083 --> 1:29:09.291
before the policemen come. [sniffles]

1:29:11.875 --> 1:29:13.875
[Jimmy unlocks door]

1:29:31.333 --> 1:29:33.333
[music playing]

1:29:54.125 --> 1:29:56.125
[Lisa continues sniffling]

1:30:05.583 --> 1:30:06.791
[sniffles]

1:30:10.375 --> 1:30:12.375
[sighs]

1:30:35.333 --> 1:30:37.333
[birds tweeting]

1:31:07.666 --> 1:31:08.875
[door bangs open]

1:31:08.958 --> 1:31:10.958
[police speaking through radio]

1:31:18.291 --> 1:31:21.375
We'll get you an ice cream
in just one second.

1:31:35.875 --> 1:31:37.166
I have a poem.

1:31:43.708 --> 1:31:44.833
[Jimmy] I have a poem.

1:31:45.083 --> 1:31:46.666
[police speaking through radio]

1:31:46.750 --> 1:31:48.166
[beeps off]
