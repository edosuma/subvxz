Two choices - let him run
while we keep on building

00:23.858 --> 00:25.778
a brief strong enough
to put him away,

00:25.778 --> 00:27.978
or pick him up on an unrelated
charge, put him on hold.

00:30.478 --> 00:32.098
Let the dog off. Muzz!

Yeah?

Federal Organised Crime Authority.

00:43.358 --> 00:45.058
You're holding a summons.

00:45.058 --> 00:48.638
We cannot over-emphasise
the importance of our Informant X.

00:48.638 --> 00:50.178
That's Frank O'Rourke?

00:50.178 --> 00:52.498
We can't afford Perish to know
he's given us a statement.

00:52.498 --> 00:55.278
Do you know a man named
Frank Xavier O'Rourke?

00:55.278 --> 00:56.898
Don't think so, no.

00:58.078 --> 00:59.578
Jesus F...

00:59.578 --> 01:02.358
You wanna do a life sentence
on account of Terry Falconer?

01:02.358 --> 01:04.178
Tink's gotta go, mate,

01:04.178 --> 01:06.538
'cause without him,
Tuno's got nothing.

01:06.538 --> 01:09.378
Tuno's not exactly...
it's not exactly dead.

01:09.378 --> 01:11.598
Brownie'll take carriage
of the Falconer matter

01:11.598 --> 01:13.138
while he's...he's doing other stuff.

01:13.138 --> 01:16.118
That's the other news.
I'm rotating you out of Homicide.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.898

MAN: You know,
I'm not supposed to do this,

02:04.498 --> 02:08.277
but I have brand-new floor mats
in my office,

02:08.277 --> 02:09.958
still in the packet, OK?

02:09.958 --> 02:11.838
So, what if I throw those in

02:11.838 --> 02:13.698
with the three years free car wash?

02:13.698 --> 02:16.178
Then would you be happy
to close the deal?

02:16.178 --> 02:17.818
OK, yeah.
Congratulations.

02:17.818 --> 02:20.338
Thank you so much.
Hey, um, just head inside.

02:20.338 --> 02:21.938
And I'll be right in
with the paperwork.

02:21.938 --> 02:24.298
Lovely. Thank you so much.
No problem.

02:25.438 --> 02:26.938
G'day, mate.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.038
Seen something you like
or just taking a look?

02:29.038 --> 02:31.258
This one been in an accident?

02:31.258 --> 02:33.498
Uh, well, there's
no chassis damage, mate.

02:33.498 --> 02:35.498
There's definitely been
a repaint on that panel,

02:35.498 --> 02:38.498
but that could just be
from the car being keyed.

02:38.498 --> 02:40.738
You looking for yourself,
for someone else?

02:40.738 --> 02:43.058
What are you asking
for the Merc in the corner?

02:43.058 --> 02:45.838
Uh...do you wanna take a look?
It's a beautiful car.

02:45.838 --> 02:47.978
Nah, I said, "What's it going for?"

02:49.318 --> 02:51.678
OK, well, it's a 1980 convertible,

02:51.678 --> 02:53.158
pristine condition.

02:53.158 --> 02:55.558
Couldn't let it go for less than 20.

02:55.558 --> 02:57.338
Yeah, alright.

02:58.558 --> 03:00.058
Done.

03:00.058 --> 03:03.298
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
I'm Ben Dokic.

03:03.298 --> 03:04.838
I'm the owner here.
Steve Wilson.

03:04.838 --> 03:05.898
Congratulations, Steve.

03:05.898 --> 03:07.898
You know, you and I,
we just set a record

03:07.898 --> 03:09.698

fastest car deal.

03:09.698 --> 03:11.778
Oh, is that right?
That is right, yeah.

03:11.778 --> 03:13.738
Hey, you wanna come inside?
We can sort out the deposit.

03:13.738 --> 03:17.058
You want a cup of tea? Coffee?
Would you like a beer, Steve?

03:17.058 --> 03:18.778
No, I'll have to take
a raincheck on the beer, mate.

03:18.778 --> 03:20.538
There you go.
Is that gonna work for you?

03:23.058 --> 03:26.418

Alright.

03:29.698 --> 03:31.138

NARRATOR: Despite his 1992
drug charges being withdrawn,

03:38.498 --> 03:41.618
Anthony Perish was
still feeling the heat.

03:41.618 --> 03:45.178
He didn't know Strike Force Tuno
had been put on hold.

03:45.178 --> 03:47.758
He was convinced
he was their prime suspect

03:47.758 --> 03:49.758
for the murder of Terry Falconer.

03:49.758 --> 03:51.238
Buying a Saab?

03:51.238 --> 03:52.738
Nuh.

03:52.738 --> 03:56.518
And if someone as staunch as biker
Frank O'Rourke had talked to Tuno,

03:56.518 --> 03:58.478
what was stopping others?

03:58.478 --> 03:59.978
Just because you're paranoid,

03:59.978 --> 04:02.818
it doesn't mean
they're not after you.

04:07.178 --> 04:10.018
G'day, mate.
Mate.

04:10.018 --> 04:13.218
Meet us at the pub around the corner.
OK. Cool.

04:14.918 --> 04:17.498
I need you to pull in Decker.

04:17.498 --> 04:20.418
Find out if those ballbags
at FOCA have summonsed him as well.

04:20.418 --> 04:22.638
MUZZ: You reckon
it might be a problem?

04:22.638 --> 04:24.378
Well, if Frank can turn...

04:25.838 --> 04:28.058
G'day. Ben Dokic.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.098
Hey, you know, if you guys
had given me your address,

04:31.098 --> 04:32.658
I could have dropped it off
at your house.

04:34.418 --> 04:37.198
Well, if I'd given you me address,
I would have had to fuckin' kill ya.

04:37.198 --> 04:38.678
(CHUCKLES) OK.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.738
I'll, uh...I'll get us a round.

04:43.758 --> 04:45.958
He's a clown.

04:45.958 --> 04:48.458
He doesn't dress like one, but.

04:48.458 --> 04:50.878
Oi, Decker's the one
I'm worried about.

04:50.878 --> 04:52.338
And he took me gun.

04:53.878 --> 04:55.918
Where you goin'?

04:55.918 --> 04:57.778
I saved you a seat.

04:57.778 --> 04:59.538
Do I know you?
No.

04:59.538 --> 05:01.878
But, uh, I can show you
the time of your life,

05:01.878 --> 05:03.638
so what does it matter, eh?

05:03.638 --> 05:05.478
(BURPS LOUDLY)

05:05.478 --> 05:07.478
Gotta get back to work.

05:07.478 --> 05:09.118
(BURPS)

05:09.118 --> 05:11.338
You fucking cockblocker.

05:14.078 --> 05:17.158
She is very friendly.

05:17.158 --> 05:19.358
Here we go, guys. Oh, almost forgot.

05:19.358 --> 05:20.858
Your new car.

05:20.858 --> 05:22.698
She's a glamour.
Oh, sweet.

05:25.278 --> 05:27.338
I'll go find Decker, will I?

05:29.838 --> 05:32.138
For the car.

05:36.378 --> 05:39.538
You like speed?
Yeah.

05:39.538 --> 05:43.018
NARRATOR: Anthony had just
found himself a new playmate.

05:43.018 --> 05:45.758
I guess that's what bored, rich,
mischievous gangsters do

05:45.758 --> 05:47.518
to fill in their days.

05:47.518 --> 05:48.998
What do you feel like?

05:48.998 --> 05:50.958
Feel like a red or a white?

05:50.958 --> 05:52.658
Yeah, maybe a white.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.878
Just, uh, pick a nice one, babe.

05:57.878 --> 06:00.658
Just gotta make a quick call.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.558
You look like
a stick of spearmint gum.

06:07.558 --> 06:09.098
What are you doing here?

06:09.098 --> 06:11.318
Our mate wants to see ya.
What for?

06:11.318 --> 06:13.178
I didn't ask.

06:13.178 --> 06:17.398
Look, I just can't disappear again.
I've got a new life now. I...

06:17.398 --> 06:18.998
I hereby quit the company.

06:18.998 --> 06:21.198
(SCOFFS)

06:21.198 --> 06:22.938
Well, you can quit when you're dead.

06:25.558 --> 06:27.178
Oh, and he wants his gun back.

06:28.898 --> 06:31.838
NARRATOR: The rules of
the underworld may seem strange

06:31.838 --> 06:33.538
to the honest citizen.

06:33.538 --> 06:36.738
If you know a man
is up to serious badness

06:36.738 --> 06:39.538
and you choose
to distance yourself from him,

06:39.538 --> 06:41.998
he'll naturally assume
you've turned informant -

06:41.998 --> 06:44.078
you're 'dogging' him -

06:44.078 --> 06:45.938
and he'll come after you.

06:49.278 --> 06:52.358
Mate! Long time no see.

06:52.358 --> 06:53.778
New wheels.

07:09.038 --> 07:10.658
Where's me gun?

07:20.718 --> 07:22.178
Is it loaded?

07:23.278 --> 07:24.478
No.

07:24.478 --> 07:27.838
Stop looking so worried, then.

07:27.838 --> 07:31.498
Now, about the money you owe me.

07:31.498 --> 07:35.358
Oh, mate, happy to pay it back
any way I can.

07:35.358 --> 07:37.878
(GUN CLICKS)

07:37.878 --> 07:40.098
That's what I like to hear.

07:42.938 --> 07:46.178
Come on, mate.
You look like you need a drink.

07:50.338 --> 07:53.178
See, the trick is
to isolate their objections.

07:53.178 --> 07:56.518
So, if they say to you, "Oh,
you know, it's only got one key"

07:56.518 --> 07:58.218
or "The tyres are a bit bald,"

07:58.218 --> 08:00.738
you say, "OK, so, apart from
the bald tyres and the one key,

08:00.738 --> 08:03.698
"is there anything else stopping us
doing business today?"

08:03.698 --> 08:06.578
You know, car salesmen, notoriously
good at picking up chicks.

08:06.578 --> 08:08.258
It's having the gift
of the gab, mate.

08:08.258 --> 08:09.938
Is that right, eh?
Yeah.

08:13.018 --> 08:16.058
100 bucks says
you can't get 'em over here.

08:18.918 --> 08:20.858
Done.

08:25.998 --> 08:28.318
So, someone's been talking, mate...

08:28.318 --> 08:30.018
..about Falconer.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.258
Mate, you know
me and my boys are staunch.

08:33.258 --> 08:35.398
No, it's not just the cops.
It's FOCA.

08:35.398 --> 08:36.898
What's FOCA?

08:37.918 --> 08:40.217
They're like cops, with more power.

08:40.217 --> 08:43.258
Spook people into talking
with a two-year jail term.

08:43.258 --> 08:46.438
Shit. So, what, someone's
given 'em a statement?

08:46.438 --> 08:48.138
Yeah, Frank O'Rourke.

08:48.138 --> 08:50.258
He's a bloody lunatic,
so it's not much.

08:50.258 --> 08:53.658
But the last thing I need
is someone filling in the gaps, eh?

08:53.658 --> 08:56.478
If there's anyone who could
put me away for a long time,

08:56.478 --> 08:57.938
it's you, mate.

09:00.358 --> 09:03.378
Just remember. It was your car.

09:03.378 --> 09:06.578
You were the last one
seen with Falconer alive.

09:10.098 --> 09:13.598
BEN: Hey, I hope you guys don't mind
if Shannon, Kate and Lisa join us.

09:13.598 --> 09:15.738
No, course not. G'day, ladies.

09:15.738 --> 09:17.598
Hi.
Hello.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.098
So, maybe we should take this party

09:19.098 --> 09:21.378
somewhere, uh,
a little more private?

09:21.378 --> 09:23.678
Yeah, youse girls got any plans
for the weekend?

09:23.678 --> 09:26.238
No, not really.

09:26.238 --> 09:28.618
Good. Are youse three sisters?

10:01.618 --> 10:03.738
BEN: You got a problem
with the clubs in Sydney?

10:03.738 --> 10:06.138
What - you got a problem with
the clubs on the Gold Coast?

10:09.578 --> 10:10.958
How are ya, mate?
All good?

10:10.958 --> 10:12.458
All good, yeah.

10:12.458 --> 10:15.258
Hey, he knows the owner?
He IS the owner.

10:15.258 --> 10:18.218
NARRATOR: Anthony Perish laundered
his massive drug profits

10:18.218 --> 10:22.018
through clubs and pubs up and down
the Queensland coast.

11:02.038 --> 11:04.378
BEN: So, what is it you do again?

11:05.598 --> 11:07.578
You could say I fix problems.

11:07.578 --> 11:10.538
OK. Could you be
a little more specific?

11:11.598 --> 11:13.258
I work in security.

11:13.258 --> 11:15.858
So you're a bouncer?
No.

11:15.858 --> 11:17.598
Man, you must have to deal with
a lot of shitheads

11:17.598 --> 11:19.098
in your line of work.

11:19.098 --> 11:23.478
Look, when Rooster
has a problem, I fix it.

11:23.478 --> 11:25.438
Rooster!

11:25.438 --> 11:26.998
Rooster...?

11:26.998 --> 11:28.638
Anthony.

11:28.638 --> 11:29.978
Anthony...?

11:31.198 --> 11:32.778
Our mate.

11:32.778 --> 11:35.378
What, you mean Steve?
Yeah.

11:36.978 --> 11:38.878
Oh, mate, your ears must be burning.
Oh, yeah?

11:38.878 --> 11:40.378
We were just talkin' about

11:40.378 --> 11:43.918
how Decker takes care of
all your problems.

11:43.918 --> 11:45.138
Rooster!

12:03.157 --> 12:05.817
Boy, am I gonna be
in the doghouse when I get home.

12:05.817 --> 12:08.557
No, Jodes and I take turns.

12:08.557 --> 12:11.197
You know, she stays home with Blakey
and I get the nights off,

12:11.197 --> 12:14.037
and then I look after Blake,
she has a girls' night out.

12:14.037 --> 12:17.457
You ever go out together?
Not if I wanna have fun.

12:17.457 --> 12:19.897
Fair call.

12:19.897 --> 12:22.017
Oh, ho, ho!

12:22.017 --> 12:24.377
Missy Higgins! (LAUGHS)

12:24.377 --> 12:25.897
It's my fiancee's.

12:25.897 --> 12:27.597
(CHUCKLES) It's your fiancee's.

12:29.637 --> 12:32.977
You have no idea
who you're talking to, mate.

12:32.977 --> 12:34.557
Alright, Tarzan.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.917
And watch what you say
around our mate.

12:37.917 --> 12:41.197
Last person who crossed him
ended up in pieces.

12:41.197 --> 12:45.077
What?
I kidnapped the bloke. Saw it happen.

12:46.177 --> 12:48.237
Well, what do you mean, pieces?

12:48.237 --> 12:51.937
I mean they had to
fish him out of the river

12:51.937 --> 12:53.397
in seven different bags.

12:56.717 --> 12:59.837
Look, I just tell you this
as a warning, alright?

12:59.837 --> 13:04.277
You get in too deep with him,
you'll never get out.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.037
You mad at me?

13:18.037 --> 13:20.377
Oh, babe, it was only supposed
to be a night out.

13:20.377 --> 13:22.117
It's a really important client...

13:22.117 --> 13:23.937
You've been gone all weekend
with your phone off.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.857
Yeah, I sent you a text.

13:25.857 --> 13:28.077
So?

13:28.077 --> 13:30.797
What do you have to tell me?
What do you mean?

13:30.797 --> 13:32.837
If you messing around with
some cheap skank, tell me now,

13:32.837 --> 13:34.917
not in six months time,
when you're feeling all depressed

13:34.917 --> 13:36.517
and expect me
to make you feel better.

13:36.517 --> 13:38.637
When are you gonna let that go?
When you stop making it an issue.

13:39.997 --> 13:43.097
Hi, Dad.
Hey, look at you, Blakey.

13:43.097 --> 13:45.037
How'd you get so dirty?

13:45.037 --> 13:47.077
Playing in the mud.
Oh, yeah?

13:47.077 --> 13:49.317
What's that you got?
A Ferrari.

13:49.317 --> 13:50.997
Yeah? Reckon we've got
some of those at work?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.557
Yes.
Yeah, do ya?

13:52.557 --> 13:55.277
Yep.
We'll try to. Should we clean you up?

13:55.277 --> 13:56.757
Should we clean you up?
Yes.

13:56.757 --> 13:58.757
Should we clean you up?
Yes.

14:29.517 --> 14:31.657
Oi, someone's poisoned me dog.
What?

14:31.657 --> 14:33.477
Yeah, she's eating like a horse,

14:33.477 --> 14:35.477
dragging her arse
all over the carpet.

14:35.477 --> 14:37.077
Someone's been in me house
and poisoned her.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.437
Maybe she's got worms.
Oh, you reckon?

14:39.437 --> 14:41.697
Well, who's gonna break into
your house and poison your dog?

14:41.697 --> 14:43.177
I mean, did they take anything?

14:43.177 --> 14:45.477
Well...

14:45.477 --> 14:47.697
..get me some
bloody anti-wormer, then.

See ya.

15:06.257 --> 15:07.717
See ya.

15:16.897 --> 15:18.357
G'day, mate.

15:19.397 --> 15:22.237
Oh, Steve, mate.
What are you doing here?

15:22.237 --> 15:25.517
You, uh, always close up on your own?
Yeah, mainly.

15:25.517 --> 15:26.997
Yeah?
Yeah.

15:26.997 --> 15:29.017
What were you and Decker
talking about the other night?

15:29.017 --> 15:30.897
When?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.597
Hey, hey, hey.

15:32.597 --> 15:35.957
He tell you anything memorable?
Hey, no. Hey, mate, what's happened?

15:41.737 --> 15:43.157
Nah, nothin'. It's all good.

15:45.417 --> 15:47.937
Let's go to the pub, eh?

15:47.937 --> 15:50.657
Come on, mate. You're me wingman.

15:50.657 --> 15:52.157
How's work? Is it all good?

15:52.157 --> 15:53.517
Yeah.
Yeah?

15:53.517 --> 15:55.277
Yeah, you could open
more nightclubs.

15:55.277 --> 15:57.397
But maybe there's
another market to exploit.

15:57.397 --> 15:59.397
You could buy a restaurant
or a winery.

15:59.397 --> 16:01.797
You know, diversify.
Yeah, a winery sounds good.

16:01.797 --> 16:04.197
Well, I spent last Easter
up at Mudgee.

16:04.197 --> 16:07.037
Really good cab sav and shiraz.
You like red?

16:08.117 --> 16:11.137
Did you say Mudgee?
Yeah, not too far from Sydney.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.917
Why Mudgee?

16:12.917 --> 16:15.597
It's nice.
No, no, why really?

16:15.597 --> 16:18.157
I don't know. 'Cause I've
been there. Just came to me.

16:18.157 --> 16:19.977
How'd you know
I got a property up at Mudgee?

16:19.977 --> 16:21.677
I didn't.

16:21.677 --> 16:24.997
You been in me house, have ya?
Looked through me stuff?

16:24.997 --> 16:27.077
How else would ya fuckin' know?
Look, mate.

16:27.077 --> 16:30.277
I don't know what you're talking
about. It's just a coincidence.

16:31.637 --> 16:33.757
You're not playing with
a full deck, are ya, mate?

16:34.857 --> 16:36.517
You know I'm not.

16:38.517 --> 16:43.177
(LAUGHS) Oh, mate, you are
too much fuckin' fun.

16:43.177 --> 16:45.817

17:02.697 --> 17:04.557
Where's he holed up now?

17:04.557 --> 17:07.497
We don't know. He's a master
of anti-surveillance.

17:07.497 --> 17:10.357
This bloke, Ben Dokic -

17:10.357 --> 17:12.656
used-car salesman
with no criminal record,

17:12.656 --> 17:14.477
no links to drugs, bikies.

17:14.477 --> 17:17.017
What's he doing with Perish
if he's a cleanskin?

17:17.017 --> 17:18.517
He seems pretty subservient.

17:18.517 --> 17:21.017
Maybe he was one of
the Falconer kidnappers.

17:21.017 --> 17:23.037
Bit of a long shot.

17:23.037 --> 17:25.777
Well, we're bringing him in
for a chat, so that's something.

17:25.777 --> 17:27.797
Meanwhile, what have you guys got?

17:27.797 --> 17:29.497
How about I serve the summons,
suss the guy out?

17:29.497 --> 17:31.637
Fine. Less work for us.

17:31.637 --> 17:34.177
And I'm bringing Inspector
Jubelin to the hearing.

17:34.177 --> 17:36.237
Oh, angriest man alive.

17:38.937 --> 17:40.437
Terrence Falconer?

17:40.437 --> 17:43.737
Look, I've never even heard of
a Terrence Falconer, Mr, uh...

17:43.737 --> 17:46.597
Browne. Detective Sergeant Browne.

17:46.597 --> 17:49.677
Mr Dokic, I wouldn't be here unless
I thought you could help in some way.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.997
What would I know?
I'm just a car salesman.

17:51.997 --> 17:53.637
Well, if you think
there's someone else

17:53.637 --> 17:55.437
we should be talking to,
I'm all ears.

17:56.457 --> 17:58.357
No.

18:48.317 --> 18:51.077
Mwah! Got just about everything
on the list, though.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.117
Hey, what's wrong?

18:55.457 --> 18:57.477
Nothin' at all.

19:06.218 --> 19:08.018
until you guys
summonsed me here.

19:08.018 --> 19:10.978
You never had cause
to talk with Anthony Perish

19:10.978 --> 19:14.278
about the abduction
of Terry Falconer, his murder

19:14.278 --> 19:15.978
and the disposal of his remains?

19:15.978 --> 19:17.718
He told me his name
was Steve Wilson.

19:17.718 --> 19:19.738
An alias?

19:19.738 --> 19:24.238
But doesn't the fact that Mr Wilson
paid up-front, in cash,

19:24.238 --> 19:26.058
for a $20,000 vehicle

19:26.058 --> 19:28.878
suggest a certain level
of criminality to you?

19:28.878 --> 19:31.138
I sold him a car. We had a beer.

19:31.138 --> 19:33.658
Whatever he's done, he didn't
tell me anything about it.

19:33.658 --> 19:36.878
He's shittin' himself.
He knows something.

19:36.878 --> 19:39.098
Reckon we can bounce him?

19:39.098 --> 19:41.538
Let's see what happens
after this first.

19:47.138 --> 19:49.598
If we ever find one,
we'll kill ya.

19:49.598 --> 19:52.218
So, they didn't ask about Decker?

19:52.218 --> 19:54.638
No, they just kept asking
about Falconer -

19:54.638 --> 19:56.138
who killed him, what I knew.

19:56.138 --> 19:58.978
Well, what do you know?
Just what I've read online.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.038
He was kidnapped
by three men from his work.

20:03.038 --> 20:04.658
They found his body in a river.

20:04.658 --> 20:07.798
And?
And that he'd been dismembered.

20:07.798 --> 20:10.138
Yeah, we sawed him to pieces.

20:10.138 --> 20:13.078
So, they were asking you
who did it, like they didn't know?

20:13.078 --> 20:14.818
Yeah.

20:14.818 --> 20:18.038
Look, mate, having cops come round
work, it's bad for business.

20:18.038 --> 20:19.578
What'd you tell 'em about me?

20:19.578 --> 20:22.618
That I knew you as Steve Wilson.
That I sold you a car.

20:22.618 --> 20:25.018
That we had beers together.
That's all.

20:28.578 --> 20:31.478
Yeah, alright.
Go on, get outta here.

20:31.478 --> 20:33.778
Go on, piss off.

How should I know?

You haven't the faintest idea?
No, sorry.

He's not protecting him
out of loyalty.

and he's genuinely packing shit.

about police protection?

Right, we'll give him a deadline.

he's not connected,

to Tink and to Decker.

down in the academy these days?

I don't think he twigged.
We were so embarrassed.

it was a dirty weekend.

till he left and we followed him.

the other way and waved him down.

a property out here somewhere.

42:08.916 --> 42:11.876

a concrete slab and an excavator.

42:11.876 --> 42:14.236
We're thinking there's
a cavity underneath the slab.

42:14.236 --> 42:16.196
When the concreter backed his
truck up, it started sinking

42:16.196 --> 42:18.076
and Perish yelled at him
to move forward.

42:18.076 --> 42:19.676

a water tank under there.

42:19.676 --> 42:21.556

he's up to, it's early days.

corroborates O'Rourke's,

44:30.838 --> 44:32.338
but it's all circumstantial.

44:32.338 --> 44:35.138
You need to ID this Decker guy.
Then you can make arrests.

44:41.238 --> 44:42.738
Thank you.

44:42.738 --> 44:44.218
NARRATOR: Gary Jubelin
had finally got

44:44.218 --> 44:48.138
his long-awaited transfer out of
Chatswood and back to Major Crime,

44:48.138 --> 44:52.018
where he and Tim Browne were both
assigned to the Gangs Squad.

44:52.018 --> 44:54.398
They promised themselves that
some day soon,

44:54.398 --> 44:56.658
they would relaunch Strike Force Tuno

44:56.658 --> 45:00.498
and bring Anthony John Michael Perish
to justice.

45:00.498 --> 45:03.758
But first, they had
to identify and locate

45:03.758 --> 45:06.078
Anthony's lethal accomplice -

45:06.078 --> 45:08.558
the man known as Decker.

45:08.558 --> 45:12.338
