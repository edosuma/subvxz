Because he's a failure!

18:48.060 --> 18:50.562
- You want to know what I've
been doing with my life, Dad?!

18:50.629 --> 18:52.631
I'll tell you
what I've been doing!

18:52.698 --> 18:54.533
Saving this town!

18:54.600 --> 18:58.103
That's right -- I'm Kid Danger!

18:58.170 --> 19:00.305
[ Jake and Kris gasp ]

19:00.372 --> 19:01.773
- So our son's a liar now, too.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.409
- What?
Why would I lie?

19:04.476 --> 19:06.044
I'm not lying.
- Stop it, Henry.

19:06.111 --> 19:10.082
- I really am Kid Danger!
Here, I'll prove it to you.

19:10.148 --> 19:13.252
Okay, look I don't have my
gum balls because I just quit.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.419
But if I didn't just quit--

19:14.486 --> 19:15.988
- So you're a quitter now, too?!

19:16.054 --> 19:19.424
- No!
Well, technically yes.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.261
But I didn't know
that I was gonna--

19:22.327 --> 19:23.929
KRIS: Ahhhh!
- Grrrrr!

19:23.996 --> 19:26.632
- Ahhhhhhhhh!!!

19:29.935 --> 19:31.203
- If you're looking for
Kid Danger,

19:31.270 --> 19:33.639
I actually just quit.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.775
- Ahhh! Ahhhh!

19:41.480 --> 19:44.349
- Okay... I'm almost done
wiping everyone's memories.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.652
- Yeah yeah yeah.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.220
- Just wanted to say --
you did a great job

19:48.287 --> 19:50.088
of wiping everyone else's
memories!

19:50.155 --> 19:52.024
- Oh, thank you.

19:52.090 --> 19:55.160
- But maybe this time you could
find it in your heart to just...

19:55.227 --> 19:58.363
let me go.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.065
- Aww. Get outta here!

20:00.132 --> 20:01.767
- Bless you, sir.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.305
Weeeeeeee...!

20:08.407 --> 20:10.609
- What a cutie!

20:13.045 --> 20:15.647
- Whatcha doin'?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.382
- Buying a school.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.651
- School of fish?
Good idea.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.954
You gonna ride 'em
or race 'em?

20:22.020 --> 20:24.289
- No, it's a school for people.

20:24.356 --> 20:28.260
- Good idea. You gonna ride 'em
or race 'em?

20:28.327 --> 20:31.563
- What? No, I'm buying
a fake school

20:31.630 --> 20:34.099
so that when Henry
comes crawling back in,

20:34.166 --> 20:35.334
begging me for his job--

20:35.400 --> 20:37.102
- Okay, one last memory to wipe.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.972
- Won't take long. Not a whole
lot goin' on in the old...

20:40.038 --> 20:43.241
um...

20:43.308 --> 20:45.177
- Brain?

20:45.243 --> 20:48.213
- Nooo...

20:48.280 --> 20:49.314
- Head?

20:49.381 --> 20:53.619
- Nooo...
what was the first one?

20:53.685 --> 20:55.520
- Brain?

20:55.587 --> 20:57.889
- Nooo...

20:57.956 --> 21:00.926
CAPTAIN MAN: Wait, wait.
Hang on, hang on...

21:00.993 --> 21:02.561
if I'm gonna get my statue,
I gotta return this kid

21:02.628 --> 21:04.463
like I found him.
- Sitting down.

21:04.529 --> 21:07.165
On it.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.935
- Schwoz, how hard would it be
to alter the memory wiper

21:10.002 --> 21:11.670
so it only erases
specific memories?

21:11.737 --> 21:13.572
Like, only memories
that involve me,

21:13.639 --> 21:15.140
or things
that I've said or done.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.242
- Yeah, there's a setting
right here.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.980
- I'm sorry, what?

21:22.047 --> 21:24.349
- It's easy!
I can adjust this setting

21:24.416 --> 21:28.553
and it will only wipe
the memories of you.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.190
- Then why haven't we been doing
that this whole time Schwoz?

21:32.257 --> 21:35.394
- Because it's so funny!

21:35.460 --> 21:37.829
{\an8}"Ohhh noooo I don't know
who I am!

21:37.896 --> 21:39.498
{\an8}"I've lost all knowledge
of my life

21:39.564 --> 21:42.334
{\an8}and the people who love me?!"

21:42.401 --> 21:44.736
{\an8}- That's true.
- So funny.

21:44.803 --> 21:49.007
{\an8}- But in his case, maybe just
wipe his memories of me.

21:49.074 --> 21:50.909
{\an8}- Got it.

21:54.279 --> 21:55.881
{\an8}SCHWOZ: Aieeee!

22:00.385 --> 22:02.821
{\an8}- Remember me?

22:08.894 --> 22:14.266
