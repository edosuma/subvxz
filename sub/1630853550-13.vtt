11:57.629 --> 11:59.196

with the universe.

Once our scientists realized
that our bodies were made up

12:01.242 --> 12:02.809

that came from stars

12:02.852 --> 12:04.462
and that everything
is vibrating,

12:04.506 --> 12:06.464
they-they explored
that interconnectedness.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.379
Similar to how birds
use Earth's polarity

12:08.423 --> 12:10.033
to know which direction
to fly south for the winter.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.253
Exactly.
The-the star map was formed

12:12.296 --> 12:14.255
by a group of Oasian rebels
who had the same strong

12:14.298 --> 12:17.171
frequency abilities for
tracking and guidance as Rosa.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.216
They selflessly
sacrificed their lives

12:19.260 --> 12:20.870
to transfer their power
into the first map

12:20.914 --> 12:22.611
upon which each following one
was made.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.179
I-It provided a means to locate
planets across the galaxy.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.572
And now that the map is broken,
Clyde needs someone

12:27.616 --> 12:29.313
with those same abilities
to help him repair it.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.751
Wait, wait. Okay.
So, if-if Clyde uses Rosa

12:31.794 --> 12:34.014
to repair the map, then...

12:34.057 --> 12:35.537
then she could die
