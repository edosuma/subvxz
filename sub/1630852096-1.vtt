00:07.050 --> 00:09.487
Last season on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:09.531 --> 00:11.489
BURNHAM:
700 years after we left,

00:11.533 --> 00:13.491
dilithium supplies dried up.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.798
The Federation tried
alternative warp drive designs,

00:15.841 --> 00:17.887
but none proved reliable.
Then came the Burn.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.977
No one knows how
or why it happened,

00:21.021 --> 00:23.936
but in an instant,
all dilithium went inert.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.330
Any ship with an active
warp core detonated.

00:26.374 --> 00:29.333
The Federation as we know it
disappeared overnight.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.596
This is where the Burn started.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.295
I'm reading that there is
dilithium dispersed throughout

00:34.338 --> 00:35.992
this entire planet.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.342
Federation could use that kind
of news right about now.

00:38.386 --> 00:41.084
There's a signal coming
from the center of the nebula.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.130
The message is over
100 years old.

00:43.173 --> 00:46.263
This is Dr. Issa
of the KSFKh'ieth.

00:46.307 --> 00:50.093
Those spots on Dr. Issa's head.
she was pregnant.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.140
SARU:
We have come
to rescue the child.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.751
Su'kal. That is his name.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.796
[screaming]

00:58.754 --> 01:01.365
I think we may have just found
the source of the Burn.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.759
SARU:
You are no longer alone.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.239
BURNHAM:
Saru has asked for time

01:05.282 --> 01:06.240
to consider his next steps.

01:06.283 --> 01:09.112
He'll return to Kaminar

01:09.156 --> 01:11.201
to help Su'kal build a new life.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.942
This is home now.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.291
BOOK:
No, Kwejian is home.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.467
I really liked seeing Kwejian.

01:16.511 --> 01:18.513
I really liked
being there with you.

01:18.556 --> 01:19.731
Have you spoken with Saru?

01:19.775 --> 01:21.820
Yes, sir, I have, but...

01:21.864 --> 01:24.388
He wants you to captain
Discovery.I do, too.

01:24.432 --> 01:27.391
So many worlds have been
struggling since the Burn.

01:27.435 --> 01:30.394
You found a way to mine
that dilithium on that planet.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.396
You and your crew
can bring it to them.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.833
You can bring them hope,
Commander Burnham.

01:34.877 --> 01:39.055
They have waited long enough,
and I think so have you.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.970
Everybody ready?

01:41.013 --> 01:42.885
ALL:
Yes, Captain.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.974
Let's fly.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.136
â™ª

02:33.805 --> 02:36.504
[high-pitched chittering]

02:41.161 --> 02:43.119
BURNHAM:
It is an honor
to be the first visitors

02:43.163 --> 02:45.469
your planet has received
since the Burn.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.863
On behalf of the
United Federation of Planets,

02:47.906 --> 02:49.473
we thank you.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.693
We've been sent
to convey their desire

02:51.736 --> 02:54.565
to reconnect with
your great civilization,

02:54.609 --> 02:57.220
and to raise the possibility
of sharing resources

02:57.264 --> 02:59.222
and technology in the future.

02:59.266 --> 03:04.096
It's tradition to give a gift as
a means of establishing trust,

03:04.140 --> 03:06.142
so, as gesture of goodwill,

03:06.186 --> 03:08.231
we've brought dilithium
on our ship,

03:08.275 --> 03:10.277
and we'd be pleased
to offer it to you,

03:10.320 --> 03:12.801
as we've done
with many other worlds.

03:12.844 --> 03:15.238
No strings attached.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.634
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.244
Uh, that's an idiom,
a non-literal ex...

03:21.288 --> 03:23.072
We're familiar.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.596
Perhaps we should speak plainly,

03:25.640 --> 03:28.077
forego the niceties
of politics.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.731
Oh, I believe
there's been a misunderstanding.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.298
No misunderstanding.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.778
You brought something
you think we need,

03:33.822 --> 03:36.390
along with the tantalizing
offer to help yourselves

03:36.433 --> 03:38.392
to our technological bounty,

03:38.435 --> 03:41.830
all for the low, low price of...

03:41.873 --> 03:43.484
no strings attached.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.703
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
she said the words "possibility"

03:45.747 --> 03:48.663
and "share,"
but other than that...

03:48.706 --> 03:50.186
Book.

03:52.188 --> 03:56.410
I am aware that in the decades
leading up to the Burn,

03:56.453 --> 03:59.108
your relationship with
the Federation was strained.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.675
But you've changed,

04:00.718 --> 04:03.199
things are different now,
we can trust you.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.598
We scanned your ship.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.122
You brought a third life-form
to our planet.

04:13.165 --> 04:16.256
-Yeah, that's Grudge.
-Grudge?

04:16.299 --> 04:18.954
Felis catus,
a domestic species

04:18.997 --> 04:21.739
of small carnivorous mammal.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.306
You claim
to understand our culture,

04:23.350 --> 04:25.090
yet you bring a carnivore
to our world?

04:25.134 --> 04:27.049
Domestic. I said domestic.

04:27.092 --> 04:30.139
She's... my pet.
She lives on my ship.

04:30.182 --> 04:34.056
I feed her, love her,
give her cat treats.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.144
Is she grateful?

04:35.187 --> 04:38.147
No. No.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.627
-In no way.
-It's bad attitude.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.106
Yet you expect us to be.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.108
-No. Oh, no, no, no.
-[laughs]

04:43.152 --> 04:44.762
-Have you come
to make pets of us?
-BURNHAM: We haven't come

04:44.806 --> 04:46.329
-to make you anything.
-You've got the wrong idea.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.678
-D...
-Let me explain.

04:47.722 --> 04:48.679
-Uh, she's a queen.
-She's a queen.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.163
You hold a Monarch captive?

04:54.206 --> 04:55.686
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.253
-Oh, Emperor Lee'U...
-No, it is not like that.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.341
-...we have the utmost respect.
-I don't...

04:58.385 --> 04:59.821
We have the utmost respect

04:59.864 --> 05:01.344
-for-for you, for...
-Absolutely. For sure.

05:04.521 --> 05:07.002
This is bad. This is really bad.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.351
Okay, so do your empathy thing.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.005
-My what?
-Your...

05:10.048 --> 05:11.659
your empathy thing,
right-right now.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.095
I brought you here
to connect with them.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.053
I don't think
they want to connect.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.361
You will take us to your ship.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.407
We will free the queen.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.757
-Oh...
-Yup. Time to go.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.066
[weapons firing]

05:31.548 --> 05:33.724
BURNHAM:
They're not gonna be happy
when they see

05:33.768 --> 05:35.291
-a massive starship.
-BOOK: They're not going to.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.858
-What?
-It wouldn't fit
through the trees.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.121
I'm sending the little guy.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.776
-And it'll be here in time?
-We're about to find out.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.082
BURNHAM:
Oh, why is there
always a cliff?

05:46.258 --> 05:47.608
[both groan]

05:47.651 --> 05:49.523
[Book whoops]

05:49.566 --> 05:51.525
BOOK:
Why did you say "carnivore"
to the butterfly people?

05:51.568 --> 05:53.309
BURNHAM:
They are not butterfly people.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.919
Why do you even have a pet?

05:54.963 --> 05:56.704
Why don't you just have
a hologram goldfish?

05:56.747 --> 05:58.488
BOOK:
I had one. Grudge ate it.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.751
BURNHAM:
Who eats a hologram?

06:00.795 --> 06:03.319
The butterflies are shooting
at us. Bring up weapons system.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.409
No. No, do not fire back.
This is a diplomatic mission.

06:06.453 --> 06:07.758
Then I'm beaming us out of here.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.934
No, we have
to give them dilithium.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.719
They don't want it!

06:11.762 --> 06:14.286
If we leave now, they will never
trust the Federation again.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.071
Or we'll come back
when they're in a better mood.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.942
-Why haven't they hit us?
-What?

06:17.986 --> 06:20.641
The Alshain. At this range,
they should have hit us by now.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.556
-And that's a problem?
-RHYS: Captain,

06:22.599 --> 06:24.775
sensors have you moving
erratically. Everything okay?

06:24.819 --> 06:27.343
-Yup. Just negotiating.
-Uh, about to hit a tree.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.214
-Hang on! [groans]
-[groans]

06:32.130 --> 06:34.785
[Burnham yells]

06:34.829 --> 06:38.310

06:38.354 --> 06:40.965
-"Don't fire back," she says.
-[loud panting]

06:41.009 --> 06:42.402

06:42.445 --> 06:44.099
They're having trouble
navigating.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.188
BOOK:
Still able to shoot at us.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.108
-BOOK: Here.
-Yeah.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.895
Great.
Maybe we'll live long enough

06:57.939 --> 06:58.896
for me to pet my hostage again.

06:58.940 --> 07:00.768
That's it.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.687
-It's their satellites.
-You're not explaining, are you?

07:06.730 --> 07:07.905
Rhys, we could use some help.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.341
Want me to send a team down?

07:09.385 --> 07:11.082
No. It's a science problem.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.737
Is this a chase? Are you
in the middle of a chase?

07:13.781 --> 07:15.478
The Alshain can't stay
on course in flight.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.480
I think we need to get
their satellites working again.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.440
Aye, Captain.
We'll figure it out.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.180
-Uh, Commander Stamets?
-STAMETS: Unless the Alshain

07:22.224 --> 07:24.052
have been hitting the
Romulan whiskey, which I doubt,

07:24.095 --> 07:26.968
-the problem has to be...
-Oh, the planet's
magnetic poles.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.970
They started shifting
300 years ago.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.059
They're now 14 degrees west
of where they'd been

07:31.102 --> 07:32.887
for hundreds
of thousands of years.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.716
Alshain use the magnetic fields
to navigate during flight.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.848
-Like birds?
-Oh, did you know birds are born

07:37.892 --> 07:39.937
with a mineral substance called
magnetite that helps them

07:39.981 --> 07:41.896
determine the magnetic field
so they can find true north?

07:41.939 --> 07:43.550
They'd have developed technology

07:43.593 --> 07:45.334
to help compensate
for the shift.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.684
-Captain was right.
-The dead satellites. They're...

07:47.728 --> 07:49.512
ALL:
Geomagnetic compensators.

07:49.556 --> 07:52.254
TILLY:
Nice work, both of you.

07:52.297 --> 07:55.518
Jovar Tal loved birds. So...

07:55.562 --> 07:57.825
RHYS:
All right, team, what's up
with the compensators?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.479
Why aren't they working?

07:59.522 --> 08:01.350
They use dilithium
to stabilize the power supply.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.221
And I'm not getting dilithium
signatures from any of them.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.658
-They're out of juice.
-RHYS: Captain Burnham?

08:04.701 --> 08:07.356
Got it.
Send DOTs with enough dilithium

08:07.399 --> 08:09.010
to restart the array.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.707
That is a monumentally
shitty idea.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.622
You want to make it easier
for them to catch us?

08:12.666 --> 08:14.929
-We have to earn their trust.
-RHYS: More Alshain coming.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.321
If we give you
some covering fire...

08:16.365 --> 08:17.801
Do not fire! We've got this!

08:17.845 --> 08:19.368
No, Michael, we do not.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.607
-We're done.
I'm beaming us out.
-We can't.

Not every moment is a victory.

Captain.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.227
-You were saying?
-Congratulations.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.795
Now they can shoot
right at us. Can we go now?

08:56.057 --> 08:57.928
You tell me.

09:00.888 --> 09:01.976
Yes.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.295
Hmm. Thank you,
Lieutenant Christopher.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.384
Put him through.

10:04.691 --> 10:09.086
You did not experience a
pleasant visit, Captain Burnham.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.436
-That's one way of putting it.
-Then may I inquire,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.700
Why still give us
your dilithium?

10:13.743 --> 10:15.179
Because we're the Federation.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.617
It's what we do.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.751
And if you need anything else,
we're here.

10:23.927 --> 10:26.277
No strings attached.

10:34.068 --> 10:37.332
[sighs] Well, that was
a hell of a thing.

12:44.111 --> 12:49.377
Great Elder, you have yet
to share your own perspective.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.466
We would value your words
immensely.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.215
Su'Kal is correct.

13:01.258 --> 13:04.131
There is no danger
of another Burn.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.785
Science is clear in that regard.

13:05.828 --> 13:10.964
I have marveled
these five months on Kaminar.

13:11.007 --> 13:14.924
Past generations of our species
lived in fear

13:14.968 --> 13:17.144
and hatred.

13:17.187 --> 13:21.365
We live now, together,
in communion.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.846
And while at times
we may struggle,

13:23.890 --> 13:27.894
I believe there is much we can
share with other worlds.

13:27.937 --> 13:31.549
Our-our duty is to our home,
is it not?

13:31.593 --> 13:34.596
If you define Kaminar,
alone, as "home,"

13:34.639 --> 13:36.163
it is, of course.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.818
But consider this.

13:41.298 --> 13:45.607
Here, we live, love,

13:45.650 --> 13:48.044
grow food
in the light of our sun.

13:48.088 --> 13:51.613
Uh, however...

13:51.656 --> 13:55.660
it is not... our sun.

13:55.704 --> 13:59.012
We share it with six other
planets in our solar system.

13:59.055 --> 14:02.885
A system which is one
of many in...

14:02.929 --> 14:05.018
a shared galaxy,

14:05.061 --> 14:07.281
Beyond our galaxy...

14:07.324 --> 14:10.501
space.

14:10.545 --> 14:14.418
In truth,
we are on an island together.

14:14.462 --> 14:18.031
We must ask ourselves,

14:18.074 --> 14:20.903
do we honor
our interconnection,

14:20.947 --> 14:23.950
or do we curl inward

14:23.993 --> 14:27.388
like a leaf pulled
from its tree?

14:27.431 --> 14:30.565
After the Burn,
that is what many chose.

14:30.608 --> 14:34.221
But this is a new era.

14:34.264 --> 14:37.050
Is it not?

14:37.093 --> 14:40.183
If you tell me you made a dress
uniform for Grudge, I'll stay.

14:40.227 --> 14:43.708
-Almost, all right? Almost stay.
-[laughs]

14:43.752 --> 14:47.625
No, you shouldn't miss your
nephew's Ikhu Zhen ceremony.

14:47.669 --> 14:50.063
A boy only becomes a man once.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.065
But this is a big deal, right?

14:52.108 --> 14:56.112
Starfleet Academy reopening
after 125 years.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.723
You introducing the president.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.900
Which you're not excited about.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.772
-Why would you think that?
-You got your growly face on.

15:03.815 --> 15:06.383
-I don't have a growly face.
-Yes, you do.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.908
You get that 11
between your eyebrows.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.911
BURNHAM:
Mm.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.738
[trilling]

15:13.782 --> 15:14.826
Oh.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.265
President Rillak is using
this moment,

15:18.308 --> 15:20.267
which should be
about the cadets

15:20.310 --> 15:22.922
and the people that fought to
bring the Academy back to life.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.706
She's doing what politicians do.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.490
Don't punch her in the head.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.884
I will do my best.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.194
I'm sorry
Saru's not here to see it.

15:34.237 --> 15:37.240
Yeah, me, too.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.677
It's okay.
He'll come back when he's ready.

15:39.721 --> 15:43.159
-Mm.
-And I will join you
on Kwejian soon.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.944
You know you got lucky today.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.642
-Luck is being ready.
-Oh, come on. We weren't ready.

15:47.685 --> 15:50.514
Are you seriously
complimenting yourself

15:50.558 --> 15:52.952
-for nearly getting us killed?
-It worked, didn't it?

15:52.995 --> 15:54.344
-Kind of.
-Mm.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.912
-See you soon.
-Okay.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.132
Be safe.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.919
Captain.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.542
BURNHAM:
Last year at this time,

16:18.586 --> 16:20.501
Federation Headquarters
was cloaked.

16:20.544 --> 16:23.025
The Federation itself
had 38 member worlds.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.245
Now, we have 59.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.943
And the cloaking shield
is nearly gone.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.163
There's no more need to hide.

16:30.206 --> 16:33.166
Today we reopen
Starfleet Academy

16:33.209 --> 16:36.038
for the first time
since the Burn.

16:36.082 --> 16:41.000
And in this moment, I feel like
anything is possible.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.480
You are tomorrow's ensigns,

16:43.524 --> 16:46.005
lieutenants, commanders

16:46.048 --> 16:48.268
and captains.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.313
And in this new world,

16:50.357 --> 16:52.924
all of you will go
where no one has gone before.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.101
And you will make the path
by traveling it.

16:55.144 --> 16:58.191
And from what I see,

16:58.234 --> 17:01.324
from what I see,

17:01.368 --> 17:04.066
I am honored
to be in your company.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.763
[applause, whooping]

17:05.807 --> 17:08.853
[whooping, whistling]

17:20.517 --> 17:23.999
And now, please allow me
to introduce our special guest,

17:24.043 --> 17:27.872
the new president of
the Federation, Laira Rillak.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.397
[applause]

17:36.968 --> 17:38.840
Thank you, Captain Burnham.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.757
Let me begin by acknowledging

17:42.800 --> 17:45.368
that today would not be possible

17:45.412 --> 17:47.631
without the USS Discovery

17:47.675 --> 17:52.114
and... your crew.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.551
Thanks to your efforts,

17:54.595 --> 17:57.467
we now have a vast supply
of dilithium

17:57.511 --> 18:00.340
we can distribute
to distant worlds,

18:00.383 --> 18:04.474
and we have reestablished
peaceful relations with planets

18:04.518 --> 18:07.086
that-- well, they were
antagonizing our members

18:07.129 --> 18:08.826
only five months ago.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.787
It's a lot to live up to.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.832
No pressure.

18:14.876 --> 18:15.920
[laughter]

18:15.964 --> 18:18.619
We are learning

18:18.662 --> 18:21.535
from the mistakes of the past,

18:21.578 --> 18:23.493
developing new technologies

18:23.537 --> 18:26.496
to reduce our collective
dependence on dilithium

18:26.540 --> 18:31.545
and continuing to rebuild
the Federation and Starfleet.

18:34.678 --> 18:38.813
Not that any of you
need the reminder, but

18:38.856 --> 18:41.468
one of Starfleet's
original missions

18:41.511 --> 18:44.123
was scientific exploration.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.560
And now that we are able,

18:46.603 --> 18:50.346
we are embracing that mission
once again.

18:50.390 --> 18:54.089
Cadets, if I may turn
your attention

18:54.133 --> 18:57.788
to the newly-constructed
Archer Space Dock.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.964
[gasping]

19:07.711 --> 19:11.193
Here, our existing fleet
will be upgraded,

19:11.237 --> 19:15.458
and the next generation of
Starfleet vessels constructed.

19:15.502 --> 19:19.201
Vessels that will once again
take us to new worlds,

19:19.245 --> 19:21.377
new civilizations,

19:21.421 --> 19:25.207
places you can't even begin
to imagine right now.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.520
Look up there.

19:33.563 --> 19:36.044
-Yeah.
-Whoa!
-Yeah.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.394
Heard you guys had some fun
with the Alshains.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.962
Yeah. Might have to cover
your shifts more often.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.094
Ah. Don't get too cozy.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.358
I'm only consulting on the Curry
for another two days.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.837
It is a privilege
to be here.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.926
I wish I could
properly thank you all

19:48.970 --> 19:50.841
for everything you left behind.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.365
DETMER:
We appreciate that.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.105
Well, it was our duty,
Madam President.

19:54.149 --> 19:57.239
But still, 930 years
is a long way from home.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.720
From this perspective, can't
really get a sense of the scale.

19:59.763 --> 20:03.027
But later on...

20:03.071 --> 20:06.074
Hmm?

20:06.117 --> 20:08.555
Those cadets-- that feels like

20:08.598 --> 20:10.034
one thousand years ago.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.949
-Oh.
-And yesterday.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.734
Which is was, simultaneously.

20:13.777 --> 20:16.127
Did you know
there are people out there

20:16.171 --> 20:18.217
that don't have to put up
with space-time shenanigans?

20:18.260 --> 20:19.696
I bet they sleep great.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.569
-Mm. Good for them.
-[laughs]

20:22.612 --> 20:25.572
[Tilly laughs]

20:25.615 --> 20:28.836
"Lieutenant" used
to feel so far away.

20:28.879 --> 20:31.142
Is this about Osyraa?

20:31.186 --> 20:33.144
'Cause you deserve
that promotion, Tilly.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.234
-You all do.
-Oh, I know.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.192
I think, I...

20:37.236 --> 20:40.804
Captain, the admiral needs you.
It's urgent.

20:43.024 --> 20:46.201
NALAS:
This is Commander Nalas
from Deep-Space

20:46.245 --> 20:49.117
Repair Beta Six,
sending a request for help

20:49.160 --> 20:51.424
from any Starfleet vessel
that might hear us.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.077
I'm not sure what happened,

20:53.121 --> 20:55.297
but we just lost
reactor-control thrusters.

20:55.341 --> 20:58.605
Gravitational stability
is also compromised, and...

20:58.648 --> 21:00.215
That's all we got.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.435
-How long ago did this happen?
-Two hours.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.437
Whatever affected the station
also knocked out

21:04.480 --> 21:07.483
-the subspace relays
in the sector.
-Solar flare?

21:07.527 --> 21:09.877
Electromagnetic pulse could
have taken all systems offline.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.922
Haven't gotten any reports
of an EMP,

21:11.966 --> 21:14.708
but we'll check it out.
Kwejian is the nearest system.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.101
-I'll check and see
if they know anything.
-Can Kwejian help?

21:17.145 --> 21:18.668
VANCE:
We can't allow them to wait

21:18.712 --> 21:20.322
for a rescue vessel
to reach them at warp.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.845
Discoverywill go right away.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.326
Your mission is to repair
the station systems

21:24.370 --> 21:26.285
and to report back as soon
as you figure out what happened.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.721
Yes, sir.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.331
I'd like to join.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.812
See that spore drive of yours
in action.

21:31.855 --> 21:34.467
Madam President,
safety protocols.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.251
We can't put you at risk, ma'am.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.950
Well, thank you for your
concern, but I can't ask anyone

21:39.994 --> 21:42.344
for a sacrifice I'm not willing
to make myself.

21:42.388 --> 21:45.478
Ma'am, having you aboard
Discoveryheightens the danger.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.917
To my crew.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.833
I appreciate your passion,
Captain.

21:52.876 --> 21:55.096
I'll see you on board.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.968
[footsteps retreating]

22:03.147 --> 22:05.019
I know that look well enough.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.021
Admiral, she's trying
to prove herself.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.849
She wants to say
she's seen action.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.547
I think
she's ticking off a box.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.636
Captain,
this is a delicate time.

22:15.290 --> 22:18.598
We're all still learning what we
need as we grow the Federation.

22:18.641 --> 22:21.383
I'm pretty sure we don't need
politics as usual.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.342
Well, you may not like
to hear it,

22:23.385 --> 22:25.996
but an adept politician can be
a very powerful tool

22:26.040 --> 22:27.824
when the world feels
upside down.

22:27.868 --> 22:31.741
And the president doesn't need
your permission

22:31.785 --> 22:33.308
to board Discovery.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.399
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm...
I'm late for dinner.

22:37.443 --> 22:38.792
Sir?

22:40.054 --> 22:42.578
I'm so glad you were able
to bring your family home.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.368
See you when you get back.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.935
And give Mr. Booker my best.

22:54.373 --> 22:58.899
BURNHAM:
President Rillak
will be joining us.

22:58.942 --> 23:02.119
Standard protocols apply.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.340
Commander Detmer, take us
to safe range for the jump.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.081
-Black alert.
-Aye, Captain.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.911
Madam President,
you may want to brace yourself.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.608
The first one can be
disorienting.

23:12.652 --> 23:14.131
I'll be fine.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.656
Flew cargo ships
for my father back in the day.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.397
Okay.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.051
Jump.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.456
Owosekun, do we have

23:34.500 --> 23:36.502
-the station?
-I'm locked onto it,
but something's wrong.

23:36.545 --> 23:37.633
Onscreen.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.682
What the hell?

23:44.988 --> 23:46.512
What could have done that?

23:46.555 --> 23:48.905
-Definitely not a solar flare.
-Whatever it was,

23:48.949 --> 23:50.298
the station can't take
that kind of stress much longer.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.604
Neither can its crew.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.954
Yellow Alert. Let's get into it.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.491
[birds cawing]

24:09.535 --> 24:11.667
BOOK:
Wow.

24:11.711 --> 24:13.974
Kyheem.

24:14.017 --> 24:16.716
So much more beautiful
than I remember.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.805
[chuckles]

24:20.415 --> 24:22.417
Can you feel it?

24:28.379 --> 24:30.730
Oh, yeah.

24:30.773 --> 24:33.341
Hello, old friend.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.517
When was the last time
you saw it?

24:35.561 --> 24:38.999
Not since I became
a member of the pack myself.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.443
You do the honors.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.853
The World Root.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.158
Put your hand on it.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.638
The warmth you feel

25:09.682 --> 25:12.467
is a chain of a million hands.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.035
We do this to remember.

25:15.078 --> 25:17.820
We do this because
the universe is unknowable,

25:17.864 --> 25:20.301
but we can know this.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.870
You're now part of a chain
that goes back,

25:23.913 --> 25:25.915
unbroken.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.483
This root system
that reaches all the way

25:28.527 --> 25:30.180
around Kwejian,

25:30.224 --> 25:32.618
it is our heart.

25:32.661 --> 25:35.708
And its sap is in that amulet
your father wears.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.754
Today you'll get your own.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.714
It's something
you never take off.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.978
Why aren't you wearing
yours, Uncle Book?

25:46.066 --> 25:48.677
-It's a story
for another day, Leto.
-Okay.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.858
The sap of the root...

25:57.686 --> 25:59.601
...and the blood of your family.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.865
Wear this...

26:02.909 --> 26:04.388
carry us

26:04.432 --> 26:06.347
and Kwejian with you...

26:06.390 --> 26:07.957
always.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.663
[chanting in Kwejian]

26:24.408 --> 26:26.802
I'm proud of you, Leto.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.499
-Thanks.
-You're very welcome.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.589
Go show your friends, go.

26:30.632 --> 26:31.938
Okay.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.470
[shouts in Kwejian]

26:42.513 --> 26:44.777
[Kyheem chuckles]

26:44.820 --> 26:47.301
I'm happy you're here.

26:49.390 --> 26:52.045
Thank you for asking me
to be a part of it

26:54.700 --> 26:56.702
[birds squawking]

27:10.454 --> 27:13.980
TILLY:
Scans show the station moving
at 720 kilometers per second

27:14.023 --> 27:16.809
with a radial velocity
of 22 degrees per second.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.768
Shields are down with a slight
magnetization of the hull.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.552
Something must've hit them.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.859
-Still no response yet, Captain.
-Keep hailing the station.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.905
Let me know when you have them.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.515
Commander Owosekun,
pull up the distress call.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.082
Aye, Captain.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.127
This is Commander Nalas
from Deep-Space

27:31.171 --> 27:32.694
-Repair Beta Six--
-Stop.

27:35.436 --> 27:38.178
Beside him, the window--
magnify that.

27:40.615 --> 27:43.836
Oh... it's extreme lensing.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.968
Two-pi steradian solid angle.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.666
In Federation Standard, please?

27:47.709 --> 27:49.929
Gravitational distortion.
Hit the side of the station,

27:49.972 --> 27:52.279
must've taken out the relay,
as well. Commander Rhys?

27:52.322 --> 27:54.020
I don't see anything
that could've created

27:54.063 --> 27:55.151
a distortion that large.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.718
Keep looking and follow up

27:56.762 --> 27:58.459
with Kwejian,
see if they have anything yet.

27:58.502 --> 28:01.680
-Aye, Captain.
-Captain,
I have Commander Nalas.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.989
Commander Nalas, I'm Captain
Burnham of the U.S.S. Discovery.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.774
President Rillak is here
with us as well.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.427
Ma'am. It's an honor.

28:10.471 --> 28:12.081
Captain, thank you for coming.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.561
What's your status?

28:13.604 --> 28:15.737
We were hit by something.
I don't know what.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.565
We've got all ten of us
in the main control room.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.741
Life support seems to be gone
everywhere else.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.874
Inertial dampeners are
fluctuating,

28:21.917 --> 28:23.571
artificial gravity is a mess

28:23.614 --> 28:25.486
and our sensors are unreliable.

28:25.529 --> 28:27.488
One of my engineers called it
a "shit-show."

28:27.531 --> 28:29.620
Which is Earth for "bad,"

28:29.664 --> 28:32.406
-I'm told.
-It is, indeed. How can we help?

28:32.449 --> 28:34.451
Well, I can fix thrusters,
that'll stop the spin.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.758
But our Q-nodes are squiddled

28:36.802 --> 28:38.934
and they need to be replaced.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.893
If you can send engineers

28:40.936 --> 28:43.243
with programmable matter,
we can get on it.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.984
Will do, stand by.

28:46.637 --> 28:47.726
"Squiddled?"

28:47.769 --> 28:48.944
Akoszonam expression.

28:48.988 --> 28:50.685
It means
"destroyed beyond repair."

28:50.729 --> 28:52.861
Tilly, what do you know
about replacing Q-nodes?

28:52.905 --> 28:54.558
I can do it,
but if you want it fast,

28:54.602 --> 28:56.430
Adira grew up using this tech.

28:56.473 --> 28:58.301
Have them come up,
and I want you with them.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.260
Owosekun, can you get
a lock on the station's

29:00.303 --> 29:01.870
control room for transport?

29:01.914 --> 29:03.524
I can get coordinates within
an acceptable margin

29:03.567 --> 29:05.569
of error if Keyla can match
speed and rotation.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.484
What do you mean, "if"?

29:07.528 --> 29:08.834
On your mark.

29:08.877 --> 29:11.227
Aye, Captain.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.200
DETMER:
We're at 20...

29:27.243 --> 29:29.202
First away mission.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.725
Are you nervous?

29:30.769 --> 29:33.423
Um... no.

29:33.467 --> 29:36.165
Fine, maybe.

29:36.209 --> 29:39.821
I just, I mean,
she made me an ensign.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.084
So she has faith in me.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.869
I...

29:43.912 --> 29:45.958
just want to show her
she made the right choice.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.481
You're gonna be great.

29:47.524 --> 29:49.744
And when I incorporate--

29:49.788 --> 29:52.312
-How about "get a body"?
-Get a body.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.923
And I start kicking ass
doing my own stuff,

29:54.967 --> 29:56.620
I'd expect you to say
the same thing to me.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.753
Yeah, you won't need it.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.842
You're, like, the most
confident person I know.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.236
Besides the captain, maybe.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.151
We are now
in a synchronous orbit, Captain.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.413
Owo should be good to go.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.069
Ensign Tal, are you ready?

30:10.112 --> 30:11.722
Yes. Absolutely.

30:11.766 --> 30:13.855
Yeah, um...
uh, locked and loaded.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.902
You know, signed,
sealed, delivered.

30:16.945 --> 30:18.338
Ready to...

30:18.381 --> 30:19.861
stop talking now.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.428
[chuckles]
Good luck.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.343
Both of you.

30:30.872 --> 30:33.614
[indistinct chatter]

30:33.657 --> 30:35.921
Welcome
to our gravity nightmare.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.313
Q-nodes are in there.

30:37.357 --> 30:40.099
Uh, I have
the programmable matter.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.318
Oh, hey, whoa!
Please do not touch that!

30:42.362 --> 30:44.146
Sir, we're here at your request.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.845
Right, but it's my station,
my responsibility.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.890
Okay, but, uh, polyhedronic

30:48.934 --> 30:51.458
-quantum-data
memory devices are kind of--
-Insanely tricky.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.895
And yes, I know what happens
when they're not properly

30:53.939 --> 30:55.810
linked to the multi-phasic
processing unit.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.595
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be rude.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.467
I'm just trying
to protect my crew.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.599
Okay, let's let,
uh, Commander Nalas

31:02.643 --> 31:04.645
take the lead here
since we're his guests.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.908
Thanks, we got to get
thrusters working first.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.389
I'm working on the primary
processing unit.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.434
You two take the secondary unit.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.523
And-and thank you.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.319
â™ª

31:45.120 --> 31:47.122
TILLY:
Commander Nalas,
I think we got it.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.819
Initiating full thrusters

31:48.863 --> 31:51.692
in three, two, one.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.958
Captain, can you confirm
that all the thrusters

31:57.002 --> 31:58.873
-are currently working?
-I can.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.571
Radial velocity's decreased
by 38% and counting.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.965
Nice job. How are life support
and sensors coming?

32:04.009 --> 32:06.663
-Just getting started now.
-How much longer do you need?

32:06.707 --> 32:09.449
-45 minutes, maybe?
-You got it.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.451
-[alert blipping]
-Captain, we've got incoming.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.670
Debris of some kind.

32:13.714 --> 32:16.238
[grunting]

32:16.282 --> 32:17.674
BURNHAM:
Commander Owosekun, analysis.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.415
It's frozen methane.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.330
-Shields up. Red alert.
-[alarm sounding]

32:21.374 --> 32:23.115
Can we extend shields
over the station?

32:23.158 --> 32:24.812
I think so, but it will drain
a lot of power.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.248
Do it. We'll figure it out.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.519
Uh, Captain, what's happening?

32:36.563 --> 32:38.782
The edge of an Oort Cloud--
methane ice.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.697
It must've been carried in
by the gravitational distortion.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.525
Hang tight. How big is it?

32:42.569 --> 32:44.223
Still trying to calculate.

32:44.266 --> 32:45.485
RHYS:
Small stuff was just the front.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.400
The rest is about to hit--
hold on.

32:51.534 --> 32:53.058
BURNHAM:
How long will shields hold?

32:53.101 --> 32:54.624
OWOSEKUN:
15 minutes, if we're lucky.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.104
Lieutenant Tilly,
this is now a rescue mission.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.063
Prepare to beam back
with Adira and the crew.

32:58.106 --> 33:00.282
It's not gonna work from here.
There's too much interference.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.544
Owosekun?

33:03.068 --> 33:05.070
I can't, either, the transport
array isn't responding.

33:05.113 --> 33:06.506
Commander Stamets!

33:08.160 --> 33:10.814
-Commander Stamets!
-Uh... the impacts caused

33:10.858 --> 33:12.686
a power surge

33:12.729 --> 33:14.949
that, uh, blew out
the Heisenberg compensator.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.864
How long to fix it?

33:16.907 --> 33:18.170
Three hours, minimum.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.562
We don't have that kind of time.

33:19.606 --> 33:22.043
What happened anyway?
Is-is Adira okay?

33:22.087 --> 33:23.914
And Tilly and everyone?

33:23.958 --> 33:26.308
Everyone's fine for now.
Skip the compensator.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.006
Pull whatever power you can
to the shields.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.485
We need time to evacuate them.

33:29.529 --> 33:30.660
On it.

33:30.704 --> 33:31.966
Tilly, can you get everyone

33:32.010 --> 33:34.055
to the station's shuttle bay?

33:34.099 --> 33:36.188
That's on Deck One and-and...

33:36.231 --> 33:38.059
we don't have
EV suits up here.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.670
What about an escape vessel?
Every deck should have one.

33:40.714 --> 33:42.324
They're only meant
for one-way trips.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.544
I can just reprogram it
to return.

33:44.587 --> 33:46.372
So just trust me with this.

33:46.415 --> 33:47.590
Please. I got it.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.637
Make it fast, Ensign.

33:51.725 --> 33:54.380
It's this way.

33:59.602 --> 34:01.822
TILLY:
The-the door is jammed

34:01.865 --> 34:03.171
from the outside.
We can't separate

34:03.215 --> 34:04.651
the vessel from the station.

34:04.694 --> 34:07.306
Okay, then we need
to climb to another deck.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.047
There's no life support.

34:09.873 --> 34:12.050
Sensors are malfunctioning.

34:12.093 --> 34:13.312
Commander Nalas,
I understand that that

34:13.355 --> 34:15.270
seems like an option right now--

34:15.314 --> 34:16.967
It is an option.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.882
It's the only option.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.841
ADIRA:
Uh, Captain, we...

34:20.884 --> 34:22.451
we have a problem.

34:22.495 --> 34:25.106
Uh, two, actually--
the de-coupler is jammed

34:25.150 --> 34:27.761
-and-and Nalas is
kind of losing it.
-BURNHAM: Tilly can handle him.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.590
We'll get you all out. Bring
the escape vessel onscreen.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.202
Shield down to 30%.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.769
Commander Nilsson,
how long will it take

34:35.812 --> 34:37.858
our DOTs to remove that debris?

34:37.901 --> 34:39.512
Longer than we have!

34:39.555 --> 34:41.514
Can we get close enough
for a spacewalk?

34:41.557 --> 34:43.124
No, but I-I could take
a worker bee.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.170
That's way too dangerous.
If we lose shields...

34:45.213 --> 34:47.824
Detmer's right, that's our best
shot, but I'll do it.

34:47.868 --> 34:50.784
-Rhys, you have the conn.
-Are you sure you should be
leaving the ship

34:50.827 --> 34:52.220
during a red alert?

34:52.264 --> 34:54.135
There's no margin for error.

34:54.179 --> 34:57.225
I've logged more advanced EVA
hours than anyone else on board.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.488
That makes me the safest
and the most logical choice.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.664
Does it?

35:01.708 --> 35:04.276
Madam President, are you
questioning my decision?

35:04.319 --> 35:07.061
A question doesn't imply
questioning, Captain.

35:10.369 --> 35:13.807
Whatever happens,
keep those shields up.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.156
OWOSEKAN:
Aye, Captain.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.297
â™ª

35:35.263 --> 35:39.180
You're thinking of Discovery
again, of your friends.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.487
Michael.

35:41.530 --> 35:43.924
I am.

35:43.967 --> 35:47.057
And it does not mean
that I am unhappy here.

35:47.101 --> 35:49.712
It is hard to be away.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.976
As it was hard to leave Kaminar

35:53.020 --> 35:54.674
all those years ago.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.504
One cannot have

35:58.547 --> 36:01.202
all the lives one desires.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.465
A choice

36:03.509 --> 36:05.728
is always necessary.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.600
Then, perhaps.

36:07.643 --> 36:10.603
Kaminar was very different
in your time.

36:10.646 --> 36:12.561
Now...

36:12.605 --> 36:14.694
you can serve the Federation

36:14.737 --> 36:17.349
and remain close to the council.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.612
To me.

36:19.655 --> 36:22.441
I made a promise to you.

36:22.484 --> 36:25.226
And it is my joy
to keep that promise.

36:25.270 --> 36:28.098
I appreciate all you have done.

36:29.317 --> 36:31.798
You're the father I never knew.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.235
And my first

36:34.279 --> 36:36.150
true friend.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.239
But I have other friends now.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.806
Family.

36:39.849 --> 36:41.851
If you...

36:41.895 --> 36:44.245
are staying for me,

36:44.289 --> 36:46.595
you need not.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.860
What of those
who still turn away from you?

36:50.904 --> 36:54.386
Who see you
and think only of the Burn?

36:54.429 --> 36:57.345
There will always be those

36:57.389 --> 36:59.826
who fear what they do not
understand.

36:59.869 --> 37:03.133
But they are fewer now.

37:04.874 --> 37:07.573
Thanks to you.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.923
I'm safe.

37:09.966 --> 37:12.012
I'm loved.

37:12.055 --> 37:15.015
I'm happy.

37:16.582 --> 37:19.324
My heart is here,
but yours can be here

37:19.367 --> 37:21.848
and... out there.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.156
Balance...

37:26.200 --> 37:27.984
is possible.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.769
Is it not?

37:29.812 --> 37:31.858
[chuckles]

37:37.037 --> 37:39.082
â™ª

37:56.317 --> 37:58.711
How long is this going to take?

37:58.754 --> 38:00.234
We just can't keep waiting.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.802
Okay, she's here!

38:14.379 --> 38:17.251
Rhys, you have eyes on that?

38:17.295 --> 38:18.774
We do, Captain.

38:18.818 --> 38:20.341
It's clear of the vessel's
launch trajectory.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.777
BURNHAM:
Great.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.084
Two pieces left,
grabbing them now.

38:30.917 --> 38:34.529
[high-pitched ringing]

38:34.573 --> 38:36.618
[heartbeat]

38:47.325 --> 38:49.327
[no sound]

38:56.856 --> 38:58.901
[crashing and shattering]

39:01.817 --> 39:03.471
RHYS:
Captain, do you read?

39:03.515 --> 39:05.821
BURNHAM:
I'm okay, I'm okay.

39:05.865 --> 39:07.693
Patch me through to engineering.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.912
-Stamets, how we doing
on shields?
-Um...

39:09.956 --> 39:12.567
-holding at 25%.
-Yes, I love 25%.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.961
Yeah, well... [chuckles]
...don't celebrate just yet.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.442
I've pulled all the power I can
from the EPS grid.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.531
And, uh, we're maxed out.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.315
No more help is coming.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.969
You saw what happened.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.840
Your captain can't save us.
Now move!

39:24.884 --> 39:26.712
Commander Nalas, no!

39:26.755 --> 39:29.410
I can't allow you take your
crew on a suicide mission.

39:30.498 --> 39:32.413
-Okay, please!
-Adira, Adira, stay on task.

39:32.457 --> 39:35.285
It's my crew.

39:35.329 --> 39:37.331
And you're leading them
to a very dark place.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.116
Put down the phaser.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.990
Nalas. It's President Rillak.

39:44.033 --> 39:46.906
I know this is a lot,

39:46.949 --> 39:49.430
all of it,
but I am asking you to give

39:49.474 --> 39:51.389
Captain Burnham
a few more minutes.

39:51.432 --> 39:53.391
I am confident
she'll get you out.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.088
All of us want you to see

39:55.131 --> 39:57.830
your beautiful world again,
i-its...

39:57.873 --> 39:59.832
freshwater oceans,
the Fissure of Jorat.

39:59.875 --> 40:02.443
How do you...?

40:02.487 --> 40:05.577
Most Akoszonam don't
even know the Fissure.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.492
RILLAK:
Oh, shame.

40:07.535 --> 40:10.973
It's breathtaking, isn't it?
The way the steam explodes

40:11.017 --> 40:14.020
straight out, condensing
into that iridescent mist.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.109
There's nothing else like it
in the cosmos.

40:16.152 --> 40:20.026
I know you want to go home,
Nalas.

40:20.069 --> 40:21.680
All of you do.

40:21.723 --> 40:23.290
Please.

40:32.212 --> 40:33.648
Yes.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.824
[grunting]

40:35.868 --> 40:38.436
Almost there!

40:38.479 --> 40:40.089
Got it! You're clear, Tilly!

40:40.133 --> 40:42.483
Go! We all won't fit
in one trip.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.572
I'll wait with them.

41:00.632 --> 41:03.156
BURNHAM:
Lieutenant Christopher, open
a channel to the president.

41:03.199 --> 41:05.506
Channel's open, Captain.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.334
Captain Burnham.

41:07.377 --> 41:08.466
BURNHAM:
Thank you for the assist.

41:08.509 --> 41:10.511
Always happy to be of service.

41:10.555 --> 41:13.035
Out of curiosity, were you
reading his file earlier?

41:13.079 --> 41:14.602
Or have you really been
to the Fissure of Jorat?

41:14.646 --> 41:16.212
It's not curiosity, Captain.

41:16.256 --> 41:18.519
You're wondering
if I lied to him.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.608
Did you?

41:20.652 --> 41:22.523
Does it matter?

41:27.572 --> 41:29.138
Station crew is safely on board.

41:29.182 --> 41:30.662
The escape vessel

41:30.705 --> 41:32.533
is leaving Discovery
for its second run.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.187
-Should be back in five minutes.
-How much time do we have left?

41:34.230 --> 41:36.145
After that last hit,
four minutes if we're lucky.

41:36.189 --> 41:37.495
[grunts]

41:37.538 --> 41:38.539
DETMER:
When the shields are down,

41:38.583 --> 41:40.106
we'll be exposed.

41:40.149 --> 41:41.368
We could be destroyed.

41:42.282 --> 41:43.501
Captain.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.111
We're not going anywhere.

41:45.154 --> 41:46.852
RILLAK:
That was an inspiring speech
you gave

41:46.895 --> 41:48.854
at the Academy,
but everything is not possible.

41:48.897 --> 41:51.247
You cannot defeat
the mathematics of loss.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.553
-We have before.
-RILLAK: Oh,

41:52.597 --> 41:54.294
so therefore
you're immune to failure?

41:59.081 --> 42:01.736
Are you pulling me
from the chair?

42:02.607 --> 42:04.304
Madam President?

42:05.261 --> 42:07.525
Because if not,
I have a job to do.

42:08.569 --> 42:11.398
You're the captain.

42:12.791 --> 42:14.532
[crew members grunting]

42:24.585 --> 42:26.631
KYHEEM:
Have you found
what spooked the birds?

42:26.674 --> 42:28.284
I've searched the entire forest.

42:28.328 --> 42:30.112
Nothing out of the ordinary.

42:30.156 --> 42:32.550
Maybe they sensed an earthquake.

42:32.593 --> 42:34.639
Too small for us to feel?

42:34.682 --> 42:36.249
I don't know, Kyheem.

42:36.292 --> 42:38.381
Well, you've been up there
for a while.

42:38.425 --> 42:41.254
Come on back.
It's time for dinner.

42:42.255 --> 42:44.300
-[alarm chiming]
-These birds.

42:46.215 --> 42:48.174
Take Leto
and get someplace safe.

42:48.217 --> 42:50.698
-What is it?
-Just do it! Now!

42:50.742 --> 42:53.092
I need to find out
what's happening.

43:02.231 --> 43:05.017
SHIP COMPUTER:
Warning. Proximity alert.
Warning.

43:05.060 --> 43:07.410
Proximity alert.

43:07.454 --> 43:10.718
Kyheem! [grunts]

43:23.688 --> 43:26.865
The nanosecond this is over,
I'm on the first ship home.

43:26.908 --> 43:29.084
-When's the last time
you were back?
-Too long.

43:30.825 --> 43:32.261
Living on autopilot, you know?

43:35.047 --> 43:37.876
What about you two? What's next?

43:37.919 --> 43:40.487
Oh, you know. Sleep. Tea.

43:40.530 --> 43:42.054
Bubble bath.

43:43.925 --> 43:45.405
Lieutenant?

43:45.448 --> 43:48.147
Oh, uh...

43:49.235 --> 43:52.891
[chuckles softly]
I don't know, to be honest.

43:52.934 --> 43:54.066
[all scream]

43:57.286 --> 43:59.506
-COMPUTER: Shuttle has arrived.
-Let's go.

43:59.549 --> 44:01.073
-[Adira exhales]
-Let's go.

44:14.913 --> 44:17.045
-[alarm blaring]
-We've lost shields.

44:18.481 --> 44:20.745
Is the escape vessel okay?

44:20.788 --> 44:21.920
Aye, Captain.

44:21.963 --> 44:23.748
BURNHAM:
How much longer?

44:23.791 --> 44:25.750
-We'll have the vessel
in five. Four.
-Black alert.

44:25.793 --> 44:27.577
-Three.
-NILSSON: Structure breach
on Deck Eight.

44:27.621 --> 44:30.319
-RHYS: Two. One.
-Rerouting DOTs for repair.

44:30.363 --> 44:32.670
-They're clear. They're clear!
-Jump!

All medical and emergency
personnel to shuttle bay.

44:47.772 --> 44:50.600
-Adira? Tilly?
-TILLY: We're here! We're here!

44:50.644 --> 44:52.733
-We're safe. We're good.
-CULBER: Let me do a scan
for injuries.

44:52.777 --> 44:54.343
Nalas?

44:54.387 --> 44:55.823
Commander Nalas?

44:55.867 --> 44:57.042
ADIRA:
I don't understand. We...

44:57.085 --> 44:59.087
made it.
We were... We were safe.

44:59.131 --> 45:01.089
Hugh! Hugh!

45:01.133 --> 45:03.309
Help me!

45:03.352 --> 45:05.093
-CULBER: Hold on! Hold on.
-I can't...

45:05.137 --> 45:06.704
We almost got you.

[grunts]

45:15.713 --> 45:18.367
FEMALE [echoes]:
Over here! Over here!

45:29.857 --> 45:31.729
BURNHAM:
Culber, what's happening?

45:32.686 --> 45:34.862
Is everyone okay?

45:51.705 --> 45:53.794
[door chimes]

45:53.838 --> 45:55.317
Come.

46:05.850 --> 46:09.375
Three dead. Four wounded.

46:09.418 --> 46:11.681
And nine who get to go home.

46:14.641 --> 46:16.251
Never gets easier.

46:17.209 --> 46:20.516
Kobayashi Maru.

46:21.517 --> 46:23.693
You're Starfleet?

46:24.694 --> 46:26.653
No.

46:26.696 --> 46:30.570
Just flew cargo for my dad
all over the sector.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.488
Taught me the value
in meeting people

46:35.531 --> 46:39.187
or circumstances where they are.

46:39.231 --> 46:42.756
The test is rigged, you know.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.236
Kobayashi Maru.

46:45.628 --> 46:47.587
They don't tell you that
up front.

46:50.503 --> 46:52.287
So when you fail,

46:52.331 --> 46:54.376
you go back to your quarters,
and all you can think about

46:54.420 --> 46:56.074
is how you want to retake it.

46:56.117 --> 46:58.859
How you can be the one
to beat it.

46:58.903 --> 47:01.644
Then you realize you never will.

47:01.688 --> 47:03.298
Yeah, hence the lesson.

47:03.342 --> 47:07.041
Acceptance. There are things
beyond your control.

47:07.085 --> 47:09.391
As captain, you mitigate that
as much as possible,

47:09.435 --> 47:12.786
-but...
-I can't mitigate
life and death.

47:14.266 --> 47:16.094
I lead to bring everyone home.

47:16.137 --> 47:19.793
Leadership is about balance.

47:19.837 --> 47:23.797
Knowing what weight
is yours to carry and...

47:23.841 --> 47:26.626
what isn't.

47:26.669 --> 47:29.498
You just don't see that yet.

47:36.114 --> 47:39.073
You didn't come on my ship
to tick a box,

47:39.117 --> 47:40.640
did you?

47:43.295 --> 47:44.862
Well, as you know,
we are developing

47:44.905 --> 47:46.385
some new technologies.

47:46.428 --> 47:49.867
A next-generation spore drive
is among them.

47:49.910 --> 47:52.391
There are still
quite a few hurdles to overcome,

47:52.434 --> 47:53.783
but other technologies,

47:53.827 --> 47:55.785
like the pathway drive
prototype,

47:55.829 --> 47:59.224
have been moving forward nicely.

47:59.267 --> 48:02.618
Plans are to install it
in Voyagerfor testing,

48:02.662 --> 48:07.058
and I am evaluating
my short list for the captaincy.

48:08.059 --> 48:11.018
I suppose I'm no longer on it.

48:12.019 --> 48:14.108
No.

48:14.152 --> 48:16.415
You're not ready.

48:17.416 --> 48:19.461
Define "ready."

48:19.505 --> 48:20.854
Don't misunderstand me, Captain.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.248
You are eminently qualified...

48:23.291 --> 48:26.773
Untested technology's
a different beast, I-I get that.

48:26.816 --> 48:29.515
But please,

48:29.558 --> 48:32.431
define "ready."

48:32.474 --> 48:34.389
The willingness to accept

48:34.433 --> 48:37.566
all potential outcomes
of a command decision

48:37.610 --> 48:41.048
and an ability to make
the hard call regardless.

48:41.092 --> 48:43.790
It's a matter of experience,
really.

48:43.833 --> 48:47.925
Respectfully, ma'am,
Discoveryis my home,

48:47.968 --> 48:50.928
so I wouldn't have accepted
even if you'd offered.

48:50.971 --> 48:53.060
That said,

48:53.104 --> 48:54.975
I don't think I'm out of line

48:55.019 --> 48:56.803
in pointing out
that my experiences

48:56.846 --> 48:59.632
have prepared me
for any kind of captaincy.

48:59.675 --> 49:01.199
Yeah, well, you saved us.

49:01.242 --> 49:03.114
You led your crew to the future.

49:03.157 --> 49:04.680
You deciphered the Burn.

49:04.724 --> 49:07.335
Yes. I did.

49:07.379 --> 49:10.817
Your acts of bravery
are irrefutable.

49:10.860 --> 49:14.995
They are also huge swings
of the pendulum.

49:15.039 --> 49:18.564
And in a time of rebuilding,
there is a very fine line

49:18.607 --> 49:20.783
between a pendulum

49:20.827 --> 49:23.612
and a wrecking ball.

49:24.613 --> 49:27.573
That is quite a strong opinion

49:27.616 --> 49:29.444
for someone who's just met me.

49:30.445 --> 49:32.012
I read the debrief
of your arrival

49:32.056 --> 49:33.405
at Federation Headquarters.

49:33.448 --> 49:35.189
Would you like to know
what it says?

49:35.233 --> 49:37.844
I take it
that's a rhetorical question.

49:37.887 --> 49:40.064
It says a tremendous loss
in your formative years

49:40.107 --> 49:42.457
has left you
with an almost pathological need

49:42.501 --> 49:44.198
to save everyone you can.

49:44.242 --> 49:46.722
I fail to see the negative
in that.

49:46.766 --> 49:49.421
Commanding
from a place of personal need

49:49.464 --> 49:51.118
places others in harm's way.

49:51.162 --> 49:53.120
Today, you were prepared
to sacrifice the many

49:53.164 --> 49:55.993
to save the few.
Everyone could have died.

49:56.036 --> 49:59.039
-But they didn't.
-One day, they might.

50:01.215 --> 50:03.957
That is precisely
the kind of Pyrrhic victory

50:04.001 --> 50:06.916
Kobayashi Maru
trains you to avoid.

50:06.960 --> 50:09.397
-[comm chimes]
-BRYCE: Captain,

50:09.441 --> 50:12.487
Mr. Booker's here.
His ship arrived via autopilot.

50:12.531 --> 50:14.315
Something's wrong.

50:15.316 --> 50:17.057
BOOK:
Pull up Kwejian
on the deep-space array.

50:17.101 --> 50:18.493
BURNHAM:
What happened?

50:18.537 --> 50:20.495
My ship was hit by something.

50:20.539 --> 50:23.498
The stars.
Everything was warped.

50:23.542 --> 50:25.326
The gravitational distortion.

50:25.370 --> 50:26.806
But Kwejian is light-years away

50:26.849 --> 50:27.676
-from that station.
-OWOSEKUN: Captain?

50:28.895 --> 50:31.854
I inputted
Kwejian's coordinates, but...

50:31.898 --> 50:33.030
What?

50:33.073 --> 50:34.422
Nothing's there.

50:35.684 --> 50:37.556
You must've done it wrong.

50:37.599 --> 50:38.992
No.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.646
These are the coordinates.

50:40.689 --> 50:42.561
Widen the search radius.

50:44.780 --> 50:46.217
I see something,

50:46.260 --> 50:47.261
but it's hundreds
of thousands of kilometers away.

50:47.305 --> 50:48.697
Pull it up.

50:50.656 --> 50:51.874
[Burnham gasps]

51:13.809 --> 51:15.855
They're gone.

51:20.860 --> 51:22.862
[voice breaking]:
They're all gone.
