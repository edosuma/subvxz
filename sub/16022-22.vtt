WEBVTT

00:06.506 --> 00:08.507
Do you guys ever think
maybe we should

00:08.509 --> 00:09.608
Fix up the shack a little?

00:09.610 --> 00:11.543
Why fix it?
Yeah.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.078
I don't know,
in case we ever bring

00:13.080 --> 00:14.613
Girls here or something.
(both laugh)

00:14.615 --> 00:15.714
Scotty, what girls

00:15.716 --> 00:17.082
Are we gonna bring
besides your mom

00:17.084 --> 00:18.350
Or your sister?

00:18.352 --> 00:20.786
You know what?
Fine. Never mind.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.054
Yo, guys.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.655
The shack door's open.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.399
Is that blood?

00:33.401 --> 00:36.135
Oh, man, we should go. Come on!

00:43.043 --> 00:46.678
Is he dead?

00:46.680 --> 00:49.381
He's not moving.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.417
That's a lot of blood.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.119
Looks like he got
shot or something.

00:54.121 --> 00:55.087
Scotty:
Whoa.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.424
Smooth move, ex-lax!

01:00.226 --> 01:01.660
You guys,

01:01.662 --> 01:03.562
Money.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.731
And a lot of it.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.834
Holy crap.
We need to go call the cops.

01:08.836 --> 01:09.835
What?

01:09.837 --> 01:11.837
(coughing)

01:11.839 --> 01:13.205
(boys gasp)

01:13.207 --> 01:14.273
(gun cocks)

01:20.146 --> 01:22.114
Well, it doesn't look
like he's gonna be making

01:22.116 --> 01:24.750
That 3:10 to yuma,
eh, super dave?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.251
I'd say he's caught
his last ride.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.454
Name is

01:28.456 --> 01:32.124
Roger mathers, according
to his texas driver's license.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.692
Single bullet wound
to the chest.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.862
Stokes: Nice powder ring
around the entry wound.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.198
Looks like he was
hiking in the desert,

01:39.200 --> 01:42.267
Judging from all the dirt
and burrs in his socks.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.269
Yeah, well, there's no shortage
of that around here.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.571
No.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.340
Hey, uh, give me a second,
will you?

01:48.342 --> 01:49.408
Yeah.

01:52.579 --> 01:54.713
This is, uh, csi nick stokes.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.715
This is sheriff combs.
He's the local law.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.150
Stokes.
How's it going?

01:58.152 --> 01:59.718
Sheriff was telling me
he knew the victim.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.520
But he's from texas.
How'd you know him?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.555
Well, he might've been
living in texas now,

02:03.557 --> 02:05.124
But roger mathers was
born and raised

02:05.126 --> 02:06.892
Right here in
ellis springs.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.494
I knew him as a kid.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.661
Brass: The sheriff
was telling me

02:09.663 --> 02:11.163
That the victim had
a moment of fame,

02:11.165 --> 02:13.432
Or infamy, depending
upon how you look at it.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.733
Yeah, back when
they were kids,

02:14.735 --> 02:16.802
He and a couple of buddies--
they had the bad luck

02:16.804 --> 02:18.770
To run across an
armed robbery.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.472
One of the kids
got killed.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.407
Shook up the
town pretty bad.
(cell phone ringing)

02:22.409 --> 02:24.910
Excuse me, I got to take this.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.145
Yeah, go for brass.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.446
So, sheriff,
what do you think

02:27.448 --> 02:28.747
Roger might've been doing
back in town?

02:28.749 --> 02:31.216
And what the hell
was he doing way out here?

02:31.218 --> 02:33.652
Well, he wouldn't be the
first guy to come out here

02:33.654 --> 02:35.721
Chasing a payday,
mr. Stokes.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.724
Loot from the robbery
was never recovered.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.160
There's a million-dollar
treasure out here

02:41.162 --> 02:45.831
Local lore-- they say it's
still out here somewhere.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.599
(chuckles):
Huh.

02:49.936 --> 02:51.470
What is it, jim?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.305
That was about my daughter.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.439
What's wrong?

02:54.441 --> 02:58.477
She, uh, just tried
to kill herself.

03:05.285 --> 03:08.287
♪ who... Are you?

03:08.289 --> 03:11.190
♪ who, who, who, who?

03:11.192 --> 03:14.393

03:33.947 --> 03:34.947
We've got an o.D.
Female, late 20s.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.615
Attempted suicide.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.883
Cocktail of clozapine,
olanzapine.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.785
Breathing steady,
but shallow.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.253
Bp: 85/40.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.955
Get her into three
and throw up

03:42.957 --> 03:44.389
Another bag of ringers, stat.
Yes, doctor.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.524
I'm sorry, sir.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.892
I'm captain jim brass.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.262
As soon as she's stable,
I'll find you.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.767
(sighs)

03:57.704 --> 03:59.504
We just heard. So sorry.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.606
How you doing?

04:00.608 --> 04:03.008
I don't know.

04:03.010 --> 04:06.278
D.A. Said ellie was here
for a preliminary hearing.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.546
She was in a holding cell.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.847
She's obviously, uh,
stockpiling her meds.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.016
I mean, I don't think
she wanted to kill herself.

04:11.018 --> 04:14.386
You know, her attorney is,
uh, filing an insanity plea.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.655
It might be some screwed-up way
of strengthening their case.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.490
Whatever's going on,
this is where you need to be.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.925
And don't even think about
the ellis springs case.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.894
You just take care
of things here.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.596
Thanks.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.665
(camera clicking,
indistinct police radio chatter)

04:28.601 --> 04:31.536
Hey, sara, find anything in
the treasure hunter's car?

04:31.538 --> 04:34.539
Well, he wasn't a health
food nut, that's for sure.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.643
Looks like he ran a solar
business down in plano.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.945
His name's on the back
as the company owner.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.580
Are you kidding me?

04:41.582 --> 04:42.981
Selling solar in texas?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.883
What? Texas
doesn't have sun?

04:44.885 --> 04:45.917
(laughs)

04:45.919 --> 04:47.719
Texas has oil.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.621
When I was growing up, you
mention something like this,

04:49.623 --> 04:51.356
It was blasphemy.

04:51.358 --> 04:52.624
Well, these might put
your mind at ease.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.059
Gasoline receipts.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.361
Looking at the where
and the whens of his fill-ups,

04:56.363 --> 04:57.796
I would say
that he drove straight through

04:57.798 --> 04:59.364
From texas to get here.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.732
Well, why was he
in such a hurry?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.301
I don't know.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.869
And what is that?
Piece of a photo.

05:03.871 --> 05:04.903
I found it on the ground
near the car.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.073
Can't find
the rest of it.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.475
Well, it kind of looks
like an aerial photo.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.777
Don't you think?

05:11.779 --> 05:12.978
Maybe the lore is true.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.479
Aerial photo of the area--

05:14.481 --> 05:15.647
Could've been
the victim's treasure map.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.090
So, I called on down
to texas,

05:25.092 --> 05:26.925
And I spoke with someone
at the victim's company.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.794
Did they say why he
came racing up here?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.962
You know, my guess is
he was racing away from there.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.631
Turns out, he had
serious money troubles.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.665
His company is

05:33.667 --> 05:35.667
Going under.
Got to say,

05:35.669 --> 05:37.836
If I found a buried
treasure, I'd spend it

05:37.838 --> 05:40.605
On something far more exciting
than saving my failing company.

05:40.607 --> 05:44.676
Like a crazy trip
or a sexy sports car.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.545
Something like that.
Uh-huh.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.480
So, there are
definitely prints

05:48.482 --> 05:50.482
On that piece of photo
you brought in, but

05:50.484 --> 05:51.917
Pretty much all of them
belong to the victim.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.385
"pretty much all of them"?

05:53.387 --> 05:54.619
Well, there is
one partial print

05:54.621 --> 05:56.955
That's not his, but
it's not enough to run.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.757
It's interesting though;
it looks like

05:58.759 --> 06:00.659
A tented arch pattern.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.127
Which is really rare.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.629
I mean, only, what, five percent
of the population has that.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.565
(cell phone chimes)

06:06.567 --> 06:09.601
Well, nick just got
the phone records of our victim.

06:09.603 --> 06:12.037
He made five calls
on his drive from texas to here.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.572
All of them to tyson briggs.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.073
Who's tyson briggs?

06:15.075 --> 06:16.575
He's one of the other two kids

06:16.577 --> 06:18.710
That got tangled
in the heist 25 years ago.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.814
So, were you and
roger still close?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.549
You guys still talk?

06:24.551 --> 06:25.817
No, not really.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.552
Everything changed
after that day.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.554
That's why it was so weird,

06:29.556 --> 06:31.490
Him calling
out of the blue like that.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.758
What'd he want?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.126
Wanted to get together.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.594
And did you?
Yeah.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.662
I thought it'd be good
to see him, you know?

06:37.664 --> 06:38.697
Get caught up.

06:41.033 --> 06:44.603
But all roger could
talk about was money.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.605
He was kind of frantic.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.573
Panicked even.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.175
He must've been
in a pretty deep hole.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.544
Was he talking about
looking for buried treasure?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.713
You know, the money
from the '89 heist?

06:54.715 --> 06:57.449
That was why he was here;
that's why he came back.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.552
<i>That money was gonna be</i>
<i>the answer to all his problems.</i>

07:00.554 --> 07:01.953
Stokes:
<i>Hmm.</i>

07:01.955 --> 07:04.823
Well, how would he know
where to look for it?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.758
Well, he didn't say.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.728
And tell you the truth, man,
I really wasn't that interested.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.599
Look, man, I'm not trying
to talk bad about the guy now.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.034
No, that's all right.
I understand. Go ahead.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.869
The whole time me and roger
were together,

07:17.871 --> 07:19.938
He didn't once mention scotty.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.673
He just kept going on
about the money

07:21.675 --> 07:23.809
And the treasure
and how bad he needed it, man.

07:23.811 --> 07:27.112
He didn't... Man, he didn't
have one single thought

07:27.114 --> 07:28.713
About scotty.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.550
And, scotty, that's the...
The boy who was killed?

07:31.552 --> 07:34.653
Yeah, we lost
our best friend that day.

07:35.721 --> 07:38.557
Please, mister,
don't shoot us!

07:38.559 --> 07:39.791
We won't tell anyone.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.193
(gunshot)

07:42.762 --> 07:44.796
Man:
Ben!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.798
What the hell?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.500
What are you guys doing?

07:48.502 --> 07:50.602
We just came here to
hang out, mister, I...

07:50.604 --> 07:51.870
Shut up!

07:54.540 --> 07:55.574
Hey, bro.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.476
It's the best
I could do.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.777
I couldn't go
back to town.

08:00.246 --> 08:02.647
Hey, hey.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.748
Ben!

08:03.750 --> 08:05.917
No! Damn it!

08:08.988 --> 08:10.655
You.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.657
Grab the bags.
You're coming with me.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.725
Get over there!
No. No, please!

08:13.727 --> 08:14.893
I don't want to go!
(grunts)

08:16.729 --> 08:19.764
Pick up the money now!

08:19.766 --> 08:21.800
You two are gonna stay here.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.102
Be quiet
or your friend here dies.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.103
You get it?

08:25.105 --> 08:26.571
(crying):
Guys!

08:26.573 --> 08:28.173
Shut up.
Pick up the money!

08:28.175 --> 08:30.542
Pick it up!
(whimpering)

08:30.544 --> 08:32.844
Guys! Guys!

08:32.846 --> 08:34.813
Guys! Guys!

08:34.815 --> 08:36.815
Guys, help!

08:36.817 --> 08:39.651
We ran as fast as we could
back to town

08:39.653 --> 08:41.019
To get the sheriff.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.588
By that time,
it was too late.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.857
We never saw scotty again.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.294
I grew up with
two great friends, man.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.229
You know, the kind
you never forget.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.533
Now they're both gone.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.835
Well, I'm sorry for
your loss, mr. Briggs.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.237
Yeah, yeah.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.210
Sidle:
<i>I just heard about ellie.</i>

09:05.212 --> 09:07.312
How is she?

09:07.314 --> 09:08.880
She's in

09:08.882 --> 09:09.781
An induced coma.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.183
She's stable, so...

09:12.185 --> 09:13.919
How are you holding up?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.253
After all that's happened,

09:15.255 --> 09:17.656
I don't even know
what the hell I'm doing here.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.692
There's a part of me that wishes
she would just not wake up.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.227
I mean,

09:22.229 --> 09:25.730
I know how horrible
that sounds, but, uh...

09:25.732 --> 09:29.301
She's put you
through a lot, jim.

09:29.303 --> 09:32.671
You know she's here
for a court hearing, right?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.306
She's gonna
testify in a court

09:34.308 --> 09:36.875
That I drove her to madness.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.777
To murder.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.112
You are not responsible
for what she did.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.848
Or what she's
done to herself.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.817
I'm not so sure.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.088
So, what do we got
on our murdered treasure hunter?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.957
Well, we are working
on that right now.

09:51.959 --> 09:55.594
We just pulled all the files
from the original '89 case.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.096
These were
our suspects involved.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.698
A pair of local brothers.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.199
Paul and ben o'malley.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.235
They robbed the house of

10:04.237 --> 10:05.737
A mid-level mob boss

10:05.739 --> 10:07.172
Named michael scarno,

10:07.174 --> 10:10.775
And in the process,
one of them was shot.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.711
According to the police report,
they made off

10:12.713 --> 10:14.846
With close to a hundred grand
and some valuables.

10:14.848 --> 10:19.284
Nick talked like there was
this big treasure involved.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.987
Well, the cash and
watches are part

10:21.989 --> 10:23.955
Of the official
theft report.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.791
But I remember
when I was writing

10:26.793 --> 10:29.160
My vegas mob book,
I heard about

10:29.162 --> 10:31.262
This michael scarno.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.131
He was an art theft guy,

10:33.133 --> 10:37.002
And he had acquired a
particular piece of sculpture.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.370
A persian-stone lion.

10:39.739 --> 10:42.140
Wow, that's over
2,000 years old.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.009
And it was just one of a pair.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.910
The other one just sold
at a british auction

10:45.912 --> 10:48.079
For close to $10 million.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.216
Finlay: Well, that could
explain the "why now" of it all.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.385
Could be that our victim
heard about the auction

10:53.387 --> 10:55.687
And then went looking
for the remaining statue.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.922
How do the three local kids
fit into the original story?

10:57.924 --> 11:00.158
Wrong place at the wrong time.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.695
The older o'malley found them
in a railroad shack.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.030
Brother was dead.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.698
O'malley then tried
to make a getaway

11:06.700 --> 11:09.067
And took one of
the younger kids with him.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.402
Scotty gates.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.303
Sanders: O'malley was caught
two hours later

11:12.305 --> 11:15.106
Out near hoover dam,
but by then,

11:15.108 --> 11:17.275
The boy and the
cash were gone.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.910
Now, the sheriff
has always contended

11:18.912 --> 11:21.379
That the kid ended up at
the bottom of lake mead.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.314
The body was never found?

11:23.316 --> 11:25.350
O'malley didn't say
what he did with the kid?

11:25.352 --> 11:26.885
He never got a chance to.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.287
He was found dead in
his jail cell the next morning.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.357
No body. No money. No trial.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.726
Seems a little bit more
than sketchy, don't you think?

11:34.728 --> 11:36.995
Case of small-town
justice, maybe?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.730
Or small-town corruption.

11:38.732 --> 11:41.066
Maybe the local cops knew
what kind of stash

11:41.068 --> 11:42.400
Scarno was sitting on.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.336
Finlay: So this is
what's left of scotty gates.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.337
An entire kid's
existence

11:46.339 --> 11:49.941
Comes down to a baseball hat

11:49.943 --> 11:51.943
And a pair of glasses.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.411
Oh, I can't even imagine

11:53.413 --> 11:55.146
What his parents
must've been going through.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.449
Wait a minute.

11:57.451 --> 12:00.385
Looks like a partial print.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.720
It could be a tented arch.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.954
Sara said

12:02.956 --> 12:04.289
She found a tented arch

12:04.291 --> 12:06.091
At the roger mathers
murder scene.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.158
Sidle:
I got your text.

12:07.160 --> 12:11.296
I was looking through
the evidence from the '89 case,

12:11.298 --> 12:13.231
And I found
a fingerprint.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.400
It's only a partial--
not enough to run.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.335
Don't tell me
it has a tented arch.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.037
It does.

12:19.039 --> 12:22.907
Is from the torn photo that
you guys found this morning,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.843
And the one
on the right

12:24.845 --> 12:26.878
Is from scotty
gates' glasses,

12:26.880 --> 12:28.146
25 years ago.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.414
Could they really be the same?

12:30.316 --> 12:32.417
It's a match.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.988
Finlay: The fingerprint belongs
to a man named sam bishop.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.456
He is a security
guard now,

12:38.458 --> 12:40.358
But back in '89, he was a deputy

12:40.360 --> 12:42.494
In ellis springs
under sheriff combs.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.763
And get this--
he left the department

12:44.765 --> 12:48.399
Two weeks after the whole thing
with scotty gates and the heist.

12:48.401 --> 12:52.370
Goes a long way to support
our theory of a crooked cop.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.406
We have his fingerprints
at both murder scenes.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.442
Russell:
Could be our killer, I guess,

12:57.444 --> 12:59.511
Covering up his crimes
of the past.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.447
Akers:
Let's take the back.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.917
Can I help you with something?

13:05.919 --> 13:07.385
Uh, lvpd. Who are you?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.254
Karen bishop. I live here.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.421
Sanders:
We're looking for

13:10.423 --> 13:11.489
Sam bishop.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.524
We'd like to have
a word with him.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.859
Um... Yeah.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.294
I'll let him know you're here.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.429
No, no. You know what?
That's fine.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.065
Karen: Excuse me,
you can't go in there.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.133
Akers:
Ma'am.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.303
Stokes:
Sam bishop?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.338
Lvpd. We need to talk.

13:30.109 --> 13:33.111
Let me guess--
about scotty gates' murder?

13:33.113 --> 13:36.347
I've been waiting 25 years
for you to come.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.556
You boys are arresting me?

13:44.558 --> 13:46.424
You got to be
kidding me.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.393
We've got your prints at
two murder scenes, mr. Bishop.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.996
Roger mathers' last night and
scotty gates' 25 years ago.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.565
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:53.567 --> 13:54.566
My father

13:54.568 --> 14:00.371
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing, do you?

14:01.207 --> 14:03.608
Get him out of here.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.477
You're making a huge mistake.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.012
My father is a good man.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.850
Well, we'll have a look
around, see for ourselves.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.597
The gun that was used

14:25.599 --> 14:28.032
To kill roger mathers
was a nine-mil,
right?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.601
Yeah, but if it's
hidden down here,

14:29.603 --> 14:31.870
We got our work
cut out for us.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.020
Sanders:
Am I the only one getting

14:49.022 --> 14:50.955
A mad scientist vibe in here?

14:50.957 --> 14:53.391
Thought this guy
was a former cop.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.530
Ooh, have a
look at this.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.506
These are the boys
from the '89 case.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.475
Stokes:
Old rabbit's foot.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.978
Like a kid
would have.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.581
Could be a trophy the killer
kept from scotty gates.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.918
Well, it's got
an evidence tag on it.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.556
And these are all
old case files.

15:25.558 --> 15:29.160
Just who the hell
is this guy?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.528
Assuming your people
didn't find

15:30.530 --> 15:32.363
Any murder weapon
in my house.

15:32.365 --> 15:36.601
But what they did find
was-was very interesting.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.004
You're one of us,
a criminalist.

15:40.006 --> 15:43.141
You were working for ellis
springs sheriff department

15:43.143 --> 15:45.176
Back in 1989.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.644
They called me a "hobbyist,"
actually.

15:46.646 --> 15:50.315
Heavy responsibility
for a young deputy.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.716
How'd that land
on your back?

15:51.718 --> 15:53.051
I volunteered.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.686
I had a knack for science.

15:54.688 --> 15:58.523
Into a murder that
took place last night.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.693
Your fingerprint was
on a torn photograph

16:01.695 --> 16:03.428
Recovered at the scene.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.963
Can you explain that?

16:04.965 --> 16:06.531
I retired years ago.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.733
Maybe you should
figure that one out.

16:08.735 --> 16:09.667
Russell:
You didn't retire.

16:09.669 --> 16:10.668
You were fired.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.736
You were let go right after

16:11.738 --> 16:13.705
The 1989 heist,

16:13.707 --> 16:16.040
Says here in your file,
for insubordination.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.308
There was no
insubordination.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.110
I found evidence

16:19.112 --> 16:22.246
That was, uh...
Inconvenient for sheriff combs.

16:22.248 --> 16:23.314
Quickest way

16:23.316 --> 16:25.383
To bury my evidence
was to bury me.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.285
Why was the evidence
"inconvenient" for the sheriff?

16:27.287 --> 16:28.753
Most charitable scenario?

16:28.755 --> 16:31.622
Local kid was gone,
presumed dead,

16:31.624 --> 16:34.325
Along with
the two men responsible.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.060
Sheriff just wanted
the case closed.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.562
Least charitable scenario?

16:37.564 --> 16:38.663
Sheriff was dirty.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.331
In on the heist.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.700
I suppose you have
some evidence to back that up?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.769
Ben and paul o'malley.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.005
Two brothers that ripped off
michael scarno's house.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.639
Bishop: They were local
troublemakers back then.

16:48.641 --> 16:52.210
Got arrested half a dozen times.

16:52.212 --> 16:56.014
More than once, sheriff combs
arranged for them

16:56.016 --> 16:57.615
To serve their time
working on his house.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.517
So you're saying
that he knew them well.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.353
Well enough he could've hired
them to pull off the robbery.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.755
Ecklie:
<i>Let's be careful</i>

17:03.757 --> 17:06.357
About allegations that
sheriff combs is dirty.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.626
Guy has over 30 years
under his belt.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.661
Yeah, well, 30 years
doesn't take away his guilt

17:10.663 --> 17:12.797
If he was involved in the
original robbery and murder.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.298
But we don't know that.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.602
Come here.
Come here.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.270
Let's say I play along.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.205
Let's say sheriff combs
was involved

17:21.207 --> 17:23.808
In the original robbery, which
ties him to the kid's death.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.744
Why would he kill roger mathers
25 years after the fact?

17:26.746 --> 17:28.413
Maybe roger and the kids

17:28.415 --> 17:30.415
Saw more that day
than we realized.

17:30.417 --> 17:34.252
Now, roger has come back,
he's desperate for money.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.720
Maybe his next move

17:35.722 --> 17:37.755
Is to try
to blackmail the sheriff.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.358
That's two "maybes"
in three sentences.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.793
It does give him motive.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.528
Look, I'm not
in the man's corner.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.129
I'm just saying,
proceed with caution.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.769
This guy, sam bishop--

17:51.771 --> 17:53.471
I'm looking at
the forensics he was doing.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.472
It's crazy.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.074
I mean,
he was way, way

17:56.076 --> 17:57.075
Ahead of his time.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.676
Polymorphic protein analysis,

17:58.678 --> 18:00.411
Analyzing gunshot residue.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.314
He has his own formulas here
for amino acid stains.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.515
Wow.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.851
I found all of these

18:06.853 --> 18:08.853
Aerial photos in bishop's box.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.555
They look a lot like the piece

18:10.557 --> 18:12.090
You found by
the victim's car,

18:12.092 --> 18:14.625
But, I mean, there's not one
that's a perfect match.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.661
There's not one with
a... With a tear on it

18:16.663 --> 18:18.529
Or anything like
that, which means

18:18.531 --> 18:20.731
Roger mathers had the only copy.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.567
He had the only treasure map.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.769
Explains why sam bishop's
fingerprint was on it.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.537
It was one of his photos.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.538
Question is:

18:27.540 --> 18:29.807
How did roger mathers get it?

18:29.809 --> 18:31.876
Russell:
Sam, these were your photos.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.779
That's why your fingerprint's
on the fragment that we found

18:34.781 --> 18:36.681
Near roger mathers' car.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.783
Did you give him
this photograph?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.752
No. And I have no idea
how he got it.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.521
These are all
original case photos.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.857
Been sitting in the same
evidence box for 25 years.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.692
They're very
impressive, actually.

18:47.694 --> 18:51.162
It's the kind of mapping
we do with drones nowadays.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.865
But you didn't have a
drone back then, did you?

18:53.867 --> 18:55.199
No.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.535
But I had this.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.837
<i>I mounted a camera</i>
<i>from a suspension rig</i>

18:59.839 --> 19:02.740
<i>Slung beneath</i>
<i>a weather balloon.</i>

19:02.742 --> 19:04.742
<i>The camera's self-timer</i>
<i>was modified</i>

19:04.744 --> 19:08.246
<i>To fire off an entire roll</i>
<i>of film, automatically.</i>

19:08.248 --> 19:09.780
<i>Took about a week</i>
<i>to map the region.</i>

19:09.782 --> 19:12.850
<i>There was no better way to</i>
<i>search for scotty gates' body.</i>

19:12.852 --> 19:15.820
Yeah, I'm-I'm gonna
stop you right there, sam.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.889
See, I had a conversation
with michael scarno's attorney.

19:17.891 --> 19:20.558
Discovered an
interesting connection

19:20.560 --> 19:22.827
Between you and
the old crime boss.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.663
He paid you
for those photos, sam,

19:25.665 --> 19:27.465
And that was
after you got fired

19:27.467 --> 19:28.933
By sheriff combs.
Hold on a minute.

19:28.935 --> 19:29.934
You weren't looking

19:29.936 --> 19:31.435
For the kid's body.

19:31.437 --> 19:34.539
Scarno hired you
to find his missing loot,

19:34.541 --> 19:36.307
His treasure.
No, you don't understand...

19:36.309 --> 19:38.209
Are you going to deny
that you were

19:38.211 --> 19:40.545
On scarno's payroll?

19:40.547 --> 19:41.746
No, I'm not.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.516
Yes, I took the old man's money.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.553
I'd just been fired,
I had a little girl to raise.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.820
But I never
gave a damn

19:49.822 --> 19:52.256
About any missing loot,
any treasure.

19:52.258 --> 19:55.359
It was a chance to find scotty.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.231
Sam, we need the photo
that roger mathers

20:00.233 --> 20:01.432
Had last night.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.601
Where are the negatives?

20:04.503 --> 20:06.337
Brody:
There it is.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.838
The photograph that
roger mathers was carrying

20:07.840 --> 20:09.807
The night he was murdered.
Hodges:
The question is:

20:09.809 --> 20:12.643
What's so damn special about it
that got him killed?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.879
Sam bishop must have
scoured these photos

20:14.881 --> 20:16.414
Back when he took them.

20:16.416 --> 20:20.351
Yeah, but he was working
with 1989 technology.

20:26.358 --> 20:27.358
Hodges:
Whoa.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.359
Hold it.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.527
Do you see that?

20:29.529 --> 20:31.629
There's an irregular
pattern in the ground.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.564
Looks like the dirt
had been recently turned over.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.566
I can run this
against a current

20:35.568 --> 20:37.435
Satellite photo,

20:37.437 --> 20:38.569
Get the gps
coordinates.

20:49.481 --> 20:51.616
Sanders:
Well, we got to be close.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.985
Coordinates we have
put us just about

20:53.987 --> 20:56.520
On top of it.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.723
Yeah. I think we're there.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.696
Sanders:
This is recent.

21:07.699 --> 21:09.567
Yeah. This hole
looks fresh.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.902
Look at the impression
in the dirt here.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.904
Could be from the lion statue.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.740
Someone beat us to the treasure.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.278
Greg.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.617
Looks like a tennis shoe.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.452
Or it was, a long time ago.

21:30.322 --> 21:31.789
Sanders:
That's a bone.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.624
Wasn't just the treasure
that's buried here.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.661
No.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.297
This is scotty gates' grave.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.537
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

21:50.676 --> 21:52.677
Here's the cast
I pulled from the hole

21:52.679 --> 21:56.781
Sure looks like a match
for the lion statue to me.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.916
Sidle: Yeah, we found
a shovel, too.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.618
So scotty gates
and the statue

22:00.620 --> 22:02.586
Were buried right here
all this time.

22:02.588 --> 22:05.723
The kid ended up
on the bottom of lake mead.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.858
Well, that's what
sheriff combs has always said.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.394
Then again, I mean,
you heard sam bishop's theory.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.096
The sheriff was in on the heist.

22:13.732 --> 22:14.899
Speak of the devil.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.675
So I have to hear
through radio traffic

22:24.677 --> 22:26.544
That you discovered
a grave.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.512
We're still in
the early stages.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.682
If the remains you're digging up
there are scotty gates,

22:31.684 --> 22:34.685
I am still the lead detective
on that case.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.921
Sheriff, right now, this is
part of our investigation

22:36.923 --> 22:38.456
Into the murder of

22:38.458 --> 22:39.557
Roger mathers.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.660
That would indicate
this is part of my case?

22:42.662 --> 22:44.929
You mean like
a million-dollar statue?

22:46.365 --> 22:47.598
Everything here
is going back to our lab.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.799
We'll let you know what we find.

22:54.439 --> 22:57.742
Bishop: All these years, he was
just a half-mile from town.

22:57.744 --> 23:01.078
I should have found him.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.418
Scotty's parents were devastated
by his disappearance.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.519
Whole town was.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.687
But his mother--

23:09.689 --> 23:13.090
It just pushed her
over the edge.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.558
For weeks and months,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.394
She posted his picture
all over town.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.429
She never stopped
looking for him,

23:18.431 --> 23:22.833
Even though, in her heart,
I think she knew he was dead.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.403
Russell:
Hard to grieve without knowing

23:25.405 --> 23:26.404
What happened.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.671
I promised her
I'd find scotty.

23:27.673 --> 23:30.975
Did everything I could,
but in the end...

23:30.977 --> 23:32.943
I let her down.

23:32.945 --> 23:36.447
Sam, I want to apologize to you

23:36.449 --> 23:38.516
For the assumptions
I made earlier.

23:39.818 --> 23:41.652
(door opens)
robbins:
Gentlemen.

23:41.654 --> 23:42.787
Doc.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.156
I spoke with
the forensic odontologist.

23:45.158 --> 23:47.491
Dental records
confirm the remains

23:47.493 --> 23:49.727
Are definitely those
of scotty gates.

23:49.729 --> 23:50.795
Russell:
Okay, thanks.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.163
Anything else
you can tell us?

23:52.165 --> 23:53.764
Well, obviously, my observations

23:53.766 --> 23:55.666
Are limited by
the advanced decomposition.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.768
Cause of death out
of the question?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.103
Not necessarily.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.806
I noticed some
fracturing here

24:01.808 --> 24:03.641
And an indentation.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.109
First, I thought
it was the result

24:05.111 --> 24:06.911
Of the body being buried
for 25 years.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.913
But on closer look,

24:08.915 --> 24:11.015
There seems to be
some impact compression.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.616
Someone struck him in the head.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.685
Or he fell and hit his head;
it's hard to say which.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.620
Do you mind?

24:16.622 --> 24:18.989
No.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.959
So this jagged mark here,
that's the line of impact?

24:21.961 --> 24:23.527
Robbins:
Yeah.

24:23.529 --> 24:24.862
You can see the
compression I mentioned.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.797
What do you think?

24:26.799 --> 24:28.199
It matches the base
of the statue.

24:28.201 --> 24:31.001
Scotty was killed
with the stone lion.

24:31.003 --> 24:35.105
Whoever buried that
was not hiding treasure.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.908
They were ditching
their murder weapon.

24:40.712 --> 24:42.713
(monitor beeping steadily)

24:42.715 --> 24:44.982
Brass:
Ellie.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.551
How did we get here, huh?

24:47.553 --> 24:51.555
How did we get here
to this place?

24:55.594 --> 24:58.896
Was it because, uh, I
wasn't your real father?

24:58.898 --> 25:00.197
I mean, we never
told you--

25:00.199 --> 25:01.899
We didn't think
it was a big deal.

25:01.901 --> 25:04.602
But maybe you
instinctively knew

25:04.604 --> 25:06.103
And you held
it against me.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.805
Is that it?

25:07.807 --> 25:10.608
Is...

25:10.610 --> 25:14.578
I mean, the natural connection
between a father and daughter,

25:14.580 --> 25:16.647
The bond-- we never had that.

25:19.618 --> 25:21.685
Was it because
we didn't love each other?

25:25.257 --> 25:26.657
I mean,

25:26.659 --> 25:27.858
I thought I loved you.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.261
I mean, every time
you were in trouble,

25:30.263 --> 25:31.996
I was there.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.764
I came.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.799
Tried to save you, help you.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.068
I mean, if that's not love...

25:38.070 --> 25:39.937
I-I don't know
what love is, then.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.675
But you kept pushing me away
and pushing me away.

25:45.644 --> 25:47.711
And now we're here.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.017
I can't go on like this, ellie.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.794
I think
I've discovered a secret

26:03.796 --> 26:05.329
About the most beautiful
woman in history.

26:05.331 --> 26:06.330
Kate upton?

26:06.332 --> 26:07.932
In history, henry.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.833
I was talking about cleopatra.

26:09.835 --> 26:12.336
Oh. Fascinating,
but I am busy.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.805
I just came to tell you
that I had no luck

26:14.807 --> 26:15.906
Isolating dna
from the shovel

26:15.908 --> 26:17.174
Greg and sara
found by the hole.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.710
Something in the sample

26:19.712 --> 26:21.879
Screwed up your extraction,
didn't it? Mm-hmm.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.081
Just as cleopatra
and I expected.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.249
(sighs)

26:25.251 --> 26:28.919
What does my screwed-up sample
have to do with cleopatra?

26:28.921 --> 26:31.221
Minerals from
the dead sea.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.824
13 of them-- not found in water
anywhere else in the world.

26:33.826 --> 26:36.126
As usual, I'm not
following you.

26:36.128 --> 26:39.063
There was lotion
on the shovel handle.

26:39.065 --> 26:42.066
The sample contained
a particular proportion

26:42.068 --> 26:45.869
Of magnesium, bromide,
bitumen, calcium and potassium.

26:45.871 --> 26:48.939
Would explain why
my extraction failed.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.076
Only one vendor sells a version
with the precise

26:52.078 --> 26:54.011
Mineral proportions
that I've identified,

26:54.013 --> 26:55.279
And they only
offer it online.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.780
I'm waiting

26:56.782 --> 26:59.316
For a list of
local customers as we speak.

27:01.252 --> 27:05.089
We found a shovel this morning,

27:05.091 --> 27:07.691
Out in the desert.

27:07.693 --> 27:11.128
It had lotion on the handle,
a very specific lotion.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.865
You know the stuff I'm talking
about, don't you, karen?

27:14.867 --> 27:16.634
Huh?

27:16.636 --> 27:18.002
You were out there.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.737
I think you went out there

27:19.739 --> 27:21.939
And dug up scotty gates' grave
to get to that treasure.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.774
Wait, what do you mean,
"scotty's grave"?

27:24.876 --> 27:27.845
We were just looking
for the statue.

27:27.847 --> 27:28.979
We?

27:28.981 --> 27:31.115
Who'd you go out there with,
karen?

27:32.217 --> 27:33.817
Roger.
Roger?

27:33.819 --> 27:36.020
Roger mathers?

27:36.022 --> 27:38.989
How'd you end up out
in the desert with him?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.324
I caught roger
breaking into

27:40.326 --> 27:41.859
My father's workshop
two nights ago.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.927
He was desperate to get
his hands on some photographs.

27:43.929 --> 27:45.696
Your dad's aerial photos.

27:45.698 --> 27:47.998
Well, why didn't you
just call the cops?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.134
I was about to,
but then roger started

27:50.136 --> 27:51.769
Talking about the treasure.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.238
The stone lion,
you know?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.006
He said it wasn't just lore,

27:56.008 --> 27:59.276
That it was really
worth something.

27:59.278 --> 28:02.079
He thought that with my dad's
photos, he could find it.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.248
And he offered to cut you
in on the deal.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.784
That's why you
decided to help him, hmm?

28:06.786 --> 28:08.986
I figured, why not?

28:08.988 --> 28:11.088
If anybody deserves
a piece of that treasure,

28:11.090 --> 28:12.756
It's me and my father.

28:12.758 --> 28:15.993
That case
ruined our lives.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.796
So the two of you went out
there to dig it up, huh?

28:18.798 --> 28:19.797
That was the plan.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.765
But it didn't happen.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.734
<i>We were able to find the spot,</i>

28:23.736 --> 28:24.968
<i>Pretty much,</i>
<i>using the aerial photo.</i>

28:24.970 --> 28:26.036
It's got to be close.

28:27.372 --> 28:30.307
These look like the pipes
that are in the picture.

28:33.978 --> 28:35.779
No. No, no.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.414
No!

28:37.416 --> 28:39.149
Somebody beat us to it.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.484
I need the money.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.286
God, I need the statue!

28:42.288 --> 28:44.121
Hey...
No!

28:44.123 --> 28:45.289
Just get away from me.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.857
Go!

28:46.859 --> 28:48.025
Karen:
<i>I walked away.</i>

28:48.027 --> 28:49.960
<i>That was the last time</i>
<i>I saw him--</i>

28:49.962 --> 28:51.862
<i>On his knees, crying.</i>

28:51.864 --> 28:55.365
I've known roger
since we were kids.

28:55.367 --> 28:59.236
I would never hurt him.

29:01.372 --> 29:03.507
(drill whirring)

29:13.318 --> 29:16.120
Come here to tell me
you talked to karen?

29:16.122 --> 29:18.422
Your daughter was the one who
raided your old case files, sam.

29:20.125 --> 29:23.060
She gave the aerial photos
to roger mathers.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.294
I can't say
I'm surprised.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.130
Her whole life,
she had to put up with

29:26.132 --> 29:28.065
My obsession
with the case.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.333
Makes sense she'd feel entitled.

29:29.335 --> 29:34.004
Went out to the desert
and they were digging around.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.506
They didn't find anything.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.309
But looks like you did.

29:39.311 --> 29:42.112
(chuckles)

29:42.114 --> 29:44.915
The real stone lion is
almost 2,000 years old.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.850
This one isn't
even finished yet.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.288
Cement?

29:51.290 --> 29:53.323
Exact size and weight
as the original.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.125
It's a perfect copy
of the murder weapon.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.161
Come here, I want to show you
something. Look at this.

29:59.197 --> 30:02.199
This is a mock-up of the boy's
skull, complete with injuries.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.500
So what's your plan?

30:03.502 --> 30:05.569
Well, I am going
to re-enact the murder,

30:05.571 --> 30:07.938
Try and duplicate the blow
that killed scotty,

30:07.940 --> 30:09.106
Prove it's consistent
with a killer

30:09.108 --> 30:11.041
The same size and frame
as sheriff combs.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.876
You really think he did it?

30:12.878 --> 30:15.546
Well, that's what
I want to find out.

30:17.282 --> 30:18.916
Not a bad idea.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.485
Is that your way of telling me
it's a good idea?

30:21.487 --> 30:23.120
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
(chuckles)

30:23.122 --> 30:25.222
I do think my
guys could, uh,

30:25.224 --> 30:26.490
Offer a few improvements,

30:26.492 --> 30:28.458
If you don't mind
joining forces.

30:34.065 --> 30:36.867
So this is
just like yours,

30:36.869 --> 30:39.203
Only we took it
a little bit further.

30:39.205 --> 30:43.273
Well, it's for practical reasons
more than anything else.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.108
If you were to do
the experiment,

30:45.110 --> 30:47.377
You'd probably have to destroy
about a dozen skulls.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.979
Sanders:
But our head here

30:48.981 --> 30:50.981
Can sustain
numerous blows,

30:50.983 --> 30:53.984
And the resulting trauma will be
simulated by that computer.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.152
Bishop:
And I assume that,

30:55.154 --> 30:57.087
Since we know
the extent of the trauma,

30:57.089 --> 31:00.891
For the exact force
and angle of the impact.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.626
Yes. And that computer
will let us know

31:02.628 --> 31:04.094
When we perfectly
recreate the blow

31:04.096 --> 31:05.229
That killed scotty gates.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.097
Very cool.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.067
What are we waiting for?

31:10.069 --> 31:12.069
♪

31:37.595 --> 31:39.296
(computer beeping)

31:41.399 --> 31:42.633
The injuries
just aren't consistent

31:42.635 --> 31:44.601
With the sheriff's
height and build.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.104
There's no way the sheriff
could've killed scotty.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.673
Well, according to this,
the killer was smaller,

31:49.675 --> 31:52.109
Barely five-feet tall
and left-handed.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.214
Back when I was a deputy, I used
to coach some youth baseball.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.582
There was this one kid,

31:58.584 --> 32:01.585
A pitcher,

32:01.587 --> 32:03.453
<i>A mean southpaw.</i>

32:05.957 --> 32:07.591
Mr. Briggs?

32:07.593 --> 32:09.693
Think we need to
have another talk.

32:09.695 --> 32:12.062
I already told you everything
I know about roger.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.297
Yeah, but now you're
gonna tell me everything

32:13.299 --> 32:16.033
You know about
scotty gates.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.235
That's where the killing
all started 25 years ago.

32:24.175 --> 32:25.242
Roger:
Please, mister, don't shoot us.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.376
We won't tell anyone.

32:27.578 --> 32:30.480
(boys panting)

32:30.482 --> 32:32.950
I think he's dead.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.018
That's what you said before.

32:36.554 --> 32:37.721
Come on, grab the bags.

32:37.723 --> 32:38.956
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

32:38.958 --> 32:40.023
What are you doing?

32:40.025 --> 32:41.158
We-we can't.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.592
He's dead.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.127
He's not gonna use it.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.263
Yeah, but it's not ours.
We have to call the police.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.364
We're not
calling anybody.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.533
Now, shut up and
grab the bags!

32:49.535 --> 32:50.567
No.

32:50.569 --> 32:53.003
No, this is stupid. We can't!

32:54.172 --> 32:56.273
(groans)
don't be a baby!

32:56.275 --> 32:57.975
This is our hideout, and
whatever's in it is ours.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.143
Now, shut up...

33:01.446 --> 33:03.046
...And grab the bags.

33:04.582 --> 33:06.083
Idiot, you didn't have
to break my glasses.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.084
My dad's gonna kill me!

33:07.086 --> 33:08.151
(groans)

33:08.153 --> 33:10.053
Here, now you can
buy new glasses.

33:10.055 --> 33:11.421
Quit it, roger.
It's not our money.

33:11.423 --> 33:12.723
The cops aren't
gonna let us keep it.

33:12.725 --> 33:14.257
We're not telling
the cops, stupid.

33:14.259 --> 33:15.392
We're not telling anybody.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.526
I told you.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.028
We have to.
God, scotty,

33:18.030 --> 33:20.030
Stop being such a wuss!

33:20.032 --> 33:21.999
I'm not being a wuss.
I'm being smart.

33:22.001 --> 33:24.101
I'm being... Normal.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.203
There's a dead guy back there.

33:26.205 --> 33:28.672
I'm going home,
and I'm calling the cops!

33:28.674 --> 33:29.706
Scotty, I'm warning you.

33:29.708 --> 33:30.707
Screw you.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.743
You're not the
boss of me!

33:35.446 --> 33:37.214
I didn't mean to hurt him.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.282
I just...

33:41.552 --> 33:44.287
I just...

33:44.289 --> 33:47.090
I just snapped.

33:47.092 --> 33:49.593
Yeah, just those...
Those bags of cash--

33:49.595 --> 33:52.763
It just seemed like
all the money in the world.

33:54.699 --> 33:57.100
I just didn't want
nobody to take it.

33:57.102 --> 33:59.069
So you killed your best friend.

33:59.071 --> 34:02.105
No. I didn't kill him.

34:02.107 --> 34:03.540
I mean,

34:03.542 --> 34:05.542
I hit him.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.777
But he wasn't dead.

34:06.779 --> 34:08.512
Oh, come on, tyson.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.480
He had a fractured skull.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.082
Stop playing
these games with me.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.550
Tell me what happened out there.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.754
Somebody... Somebody else
was out there that day.

34:19.157 --> 34:20.524
We didn't know
we'd been followed.

34:20.526 --> 34:21.525
Girl:
<i>Hey, guys!</i>

34:21.527 --> 34:22.659
(groans)

34:22.661 --> 34:24.094
You guys better
shut him up.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.663
Damn it, karen. Why do you
always have to follow us?

34:26.665 --> 34:28.131
Didn't you hear what I said?

34:28.133 --> 34:30.267
There's a car coming.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.078
(groaning)

34:41.080 --> 34:43.180
Shh.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.718
(muffled groaning)

34:48.720 --> 34:50.487
Damn it!

34:58.496 --> 34:59.563
No!

35:09.807 --> 35:13.110
Stokes:
<i>So, you smothered him?</i>

35:13.112 --> 35:16.480
Look, I felt bad.

35:16.482 --> 35:20.717
But in the moment,
it was him or all of us.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.288
So, the three of
you buried scotty

35:25.290 --> 35:28.158
Out in the desert
along with that statue?

35:28.160 --> 35:30.127
We were worried
someone would find him.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.229
But right away,
the focus shifted to lake mead,

35:32.231 --> 35:34.164
So no one ever did.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.133
What happened to all
that money? The cash?

35:36.135 --> 35:38.435
We hid it under the porch
at roger's house.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.403
Couple of months later,
his grandmother fell asleep

35:40.405 --> 35:42.506
On the couch
with a cigarette in her hand.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.241
Burned the house to the ground.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.610
So, scotty died
for nothing.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.512
We were just kids.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.280
Stupid kids.

35:50.282 --> 35:54.184
Yeah, well, you're not
a kid anymore, karen.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.386
Know what you are?

35:56.388 --> 36:01.224
I think you lied to us the
last time you came in here.

36:01.226 --> 36:03.493
Think that you and roger
found that stone lion

36:03.495 --> 36:04.928
The other night, the two of you.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.696
You know what
else I think?

36:06.698 --> 36:10.267
I think when you got
to the cars...

36:12.470 --> 36:14.237
...Something went wrong.

36:14.239 --> 36:16.907
That wasn't the deal, roger.
You said we'd split it 50/50.

36:16.909 --> 36:19.576
I said we'd split it;
I didn't say how.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.211
You didn't even know
the statue was

36:21.213 --> 36:22.279
Worth anything until I told you.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.346
And you never
would've found it

36:23.348 --> 36:25.916
Without my
father's photos.

36:25.918 --> 36:28.652
I'll cut you in
for a finder's fee.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.221
Come on, karen.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.923
What are you gonna do?

36:34.458 --> 36:35.892
You gonna kill me?

36:35.894 --> 36:37.627
Like you killed scotty?

36:40.565 --> 36:42.966
Not a bad theory.

36:44.268 --> 36:48.205
Problem is,
you don't have any evidence.

36:49.240 --> 36:53.910
My father always taught me:
No evidence, no case.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.445
Finlay:
<i>There is no way</i>

36:55.447 --> 36:57.681
That we can get her
for scotty gates' murder.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.282
She was 11 at the time,

36:59.284 --> 37:01.451
And we can't even conclude
a cause of death.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.520
We have to get her for
killing roger mathers.

37:03.522 --> 37:04.988
I know, but we don't
have the evidence.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.324
And by the time we do,
she will have

37:07.326 --> 37:08.725
Covered her tracks.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.927
Sam? You
looking for me?

37:15.566 --> 37:17.367
When karen was a teenager,

37:17.369 --> 37:19.836
She used to go down to
the creek bed behind our house.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.339
She had this little hiding place
down there where she'd

37:22.341 --> 37:26.376
Stash her cigarettes,
thinking I-I didn't know.

37:27.445 --> 37:30.480
I took a look
down there tonight.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.787
If this is what
I think it is,

37:37.789 --> 37:41.791
Your daughter can go
to prison for a long time.

37:51.803 --> 37:55.272
Same caliber
that killed roger mathers.

37:55.274 --> 37:56.773
All for this.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.410
Bishop: You know,
for years, I wondered

38:00.412 --> 38:01.745
If that thing really existed.

38:01.747 --> 38:04.848
Now, more than ever,
I wish it hadn't.

38:07.551 --> 38:11.288
I thought I knew my little girl.

38:11.290 --> 38:12.822
I thought we had no secrets.

38:14.525 --> 38:17.494
For 25 years, she'd been
hiding the truth from me.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.765
I don't understand it.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.300
I just...

38:23.302 --> 38:25.702
I'm sorry. I really am.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.570
You do everything
you can for your kid.

38:27.572 --> 38:30.073
You-you give them everything.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.842
Everything.

38:32.844 --> 38:36.446
Including the power
to break your heart.

38:49.026 --> 38:51.061
Captain, you wanted
to know if there was news.

38:51.063 --> 38:52.595
Yeah.

38:52.597 --> 38:54.764
The swelling in ellie's brain
has subsided enough

38:54.766 --> 38:56.766
That we've reduced
the medication.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.068
She is responsive now.

38:58.070 --> 38:59.736
She's awake?
Yes.

38:59.738 --> 39:01.404
But still in recovery.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.540
I understand.
Thank you, doctor.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.853
They told me you were hovering.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.121
Yeah.

39:18.123 --> 39:21.591
I just want to, uh, make
sure that you were...

39:24.495 --> 39:27.530
We both know that
that's not really possible.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.533
Why'd you even come?

39:30.535 --> 39:34.003
I guess I'm...

39:34.005 --> 39:36.873
Just not ready to...

39:36.875 --> 39:38.708
Give up on you, ellie.

39:41.612 --> 39:44.781
This is not your fault.

39:44.783 --> 39:47.784
There's always been
something wrong with me.

39:47.786 --> 39:50.387
No, that-that's not true.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.556
You should just let me go.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.825
I've tried.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.460
Believe me.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.530
But I can't.

40:00.532 --> 40:03.166
I mean...

40:03.168 --> 40:05.668
You're all I have left.

40:08.973 --> 40:11.107
Look, I'm going to, uh...

40:11.109 --> 40:13.910
I'm gonna let you rest,
let you sleep, okay?

40:18.149 --> 40:20.417
No. Stay.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.821
Please, dad?

40:31.061 --> 40:32.162
Hey, jim.

40:32.164 --> 40:33.730
Hmm.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.598
D.B., come in. Sit down.

40:40.938 --> 40:43.440
I hear ellie's
out of the woods.

40:43.442 --> 40:44.874
Yeah.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.477
Two of you able to talk?

40:48.879 --> 40:50.213
Yeah, we did.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.649
For a while.

40:52.651 --> 40:53.783
You all right?

40:53.785 --> 40:54.851
I am, actually.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.719
Can I buy you a drink?

40:56.721 --> 40:58.221
Yeah.

41:02.927 --> 41:05.495
Here you go.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.196
Happy days.

41:06.198 --> 41:08.498
Happy day.

41:08.500 --> 41:12.135
You're a little calmer
than I thought you might be.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.703
You sure you're all right?

41:13.705 --> 41:16.539
Yeah, I just had
a four-hour conversation

41:16.541 --> 41:18.107
With my daughter.

41:18.109 --> 41:21.144
That's something that hasn't
happened to me in 15 years.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.747
We realize
that we need each other.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.549
Even more now.

41:29.553 --> 41:31.521
I-I would be a little...

41:31.523 --> 41:33.590
Little bit cautious
if I were you.

41:33.592 --> 41:37.727
You think she's trying
to manipulate me-- is that it?

41:39.530 --> 41:41.764
I love her, d.B.

41:41.766 --> 41:43.032
I have to trust her.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.902
She's all I got.

41:45.904 --> 41:49.205
And I want to be there for her,
I mean, really be there.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.575
Help her out,
the way any father would.

41:52.577 --> 41:54.110
Good for you.

41:54.112 --> 41:56.279
And I hope it works out.
I really do.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.715
Well, you and me both.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.617
And with a little luck,
who knows?

42:00.619 --> 42:02.218
Okay.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.587
I think I'm gonna
hit the road.

42:04.589 --> 42:06.089
Okay.

42:06.091 --> 42:08.157
Yeah.

42:11.161 --> 42:12.729
Want to walk out with me?

42:12.731 --> 42:15.598
No, I think I'm gonna
hang out here for a while.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.101
I got to figure some things out.

42:18.103 --> 42:20.169
Okay.

42:24.642 --> 42:32.649
