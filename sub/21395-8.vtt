Saraline?

08:57.436 --> 08:58.704
- --babysitter.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.406
- JULIA: We're doing
a fashion show.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.341
- I'm busy!

gone dither.

it better.

09:26.032 --> 09:30.136

it's extremely powerful,

09:33.239 --> 09:35.908
and we've seen it used
in a variety of ways.

09:35.975 --> 09:39.512
But how does it figure into
the spy's master plan?

camping, huh?

09:51.757 --> 09:52.825
'Cause it seems like
we're sitting in

09:52.892 --> 09:55.728

like a race car.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.530
- Olly, why are
we sitting here?

09:57.596 --> 09:59.732
- To summon
Moe Strummer's ghost.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.734
I figured it would help.
He is a driving ghost.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.436
- Can't we just have
a normal camp out

10:03.502 --> 10:04.904

10:04.971 --> 10:05.838

You take the day-old

10:07.406 --> 10:08.774
I'll take the half-

for obvious reasons,

10:10.509 --> 10:11.610

need, Saraline?

10:23.222 --> 10:24.523
You want us to stay here?

10:24.590 --> 10:26.292
Not summoning ghosts
in the not dark?

10:26.359 --> 10:27.693
- I want my rainbow gas.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.028
I know you
have it, Olly.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.496
- I do...

10:30.563 --> 10:31.664
not.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.866
Search me.
- Oh, I will.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.634
- Not that! Not that!

10:35.701 --> 10:37.803
Top end! Top end!

10:37.870 --> 10:39.605
All right, all right,
I took it.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.340
But it was for
your own good.

10:41.407 --> 10:42.308
and you're not
getting it back

10:42.375 --> 10:44.176

the gas is in a safe place.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.450
I hope you can see
I'm only trying to--

10:51.517 --> 10:53.185

10:58.858 --> 11:00.693

wanted to--whoa!

11:00.760 --> 11:02.928
Looks like glitter
threw up in here.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.898
And what it threw up
was more glitter.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.833
- If you're here
to drag me out

11:07.900 --> 11:09.769

I'm not interested.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.303

child genius to another,

11:14.140 --> 11:15.341
[clears throat]

11:15.408 --> 11:18.544
distinctly less charismatic,
not genius, but...

11:18.611 --> 11:20.713
you're bright.
We'll go with bright.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.281
- Your point being?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.950
- I know and you know
we don't need babysitters.

11:25.017 --> 11:29.088
But it's actually more
fun than you'd imagine.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.824

- And Julia's good people.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.493
Trust me, you do
not want to miss--

11:34.560 --> 11:35.861

we saved for thee.

No, that's the one

above them.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.221
It's spotted its prey.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.223

12:04.290 --> 12:06.025
What? It's a race car.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.731
It's not stupid.
Well, it is stupid.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.466
But it's not a legend.
Well, it is a legend.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.001
But it's real!

13:22.067 --> 13:24.703

I seriously doubt it.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.408
That is one boring
ghost story, man.

manage to summon it,

it's supposed
to be harmless.
