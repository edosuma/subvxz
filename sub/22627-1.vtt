00:29.583 --> 00:31.249
This is Hoffman's Head.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.415
Hey, Headlights,

00:32.417 --> 00:34.958
I'm gonna open up your Fanmail.

00:34.959 --> 00:37.083
"To Garrett Hoffman."
Well, that's me!

00:38.458 --> 00:40.249
Oh!

00:40.250 --> 00:42.124
And the note says, "Garrett,

00:42.125 --> 00:44.124
"My pet earthworm had babies,

00:44.125 --> 00:47.666
and I'm giving them
to you to raise."

00:47.667 --> 00:48.667
From Tony.

00:48.668 --> 00:51.958
Alright, I'm just going
fucking crazy!

00:51.959 --> 00:55.749
I can't control
this fucking car!

00:55.750 --> 00:57.624
What's the first word
that comes to your mind

00:57.625 --> 00:59.124
when you think of air?

00:59.125 --> 01:00.666
It's lightweight, see.

01:00.667 --> 01:01.792
What is it?

01:02.834 --> 01:03.959
What is it?!

01:06.458 --> 01:10.624
In our laboratories, we did
scientific side-by-side tests.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.416
Breathing air
versus breathing...

01:12.417 --> 01:13.791
Chicken broth.

01:13.792 --> 01:15.958
Air is better.

01:15.959 --> 01:17.666
You literally brought
a cane to a gunfight.

01:17.667 --> 01:19.708
Why don't you just
derail the train, Garrett?

01:19.709 --> 01:21.624
Some things shall be easy.

01:21.625 --> 01:23.582
It's "Assassins Creed."
It must be a dance.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.708
Babe, who's... ah!
Who's winning?

01:25.709 --> 01:26.874
So... so he's good.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.457
Oh!

01:30.959 --> 01:33.499
Oh my God! They're on my face.
They're on my face.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.624
You know, I have no idea why,

01:34.625 --> 01:36.165
but the first thing
that comes to my mind

01:36.166 --> 01:37.499
when I think of the word "air"

01:37.500 --> 01:39.666
is "airy."

01:39.667 --> 01:40.708
Talcum powder.

01:42.875 --> 01:43.958
Air is better.

01:43.959 --> 01:45.916
Hey, thanks for letting us
into your devices.

01:45.917 --> 01:47.874
Next time on
"Cooking with Serial Killers"

01:47.875 --> 01:51.499
Jeffrey Dahmer is back
with tips on summer grilling.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.708
It's gonna be great.

01:52.709 --> 01:54.666

Okay!
Rolling!

02:10.458 --> 02:11.708
We hit two million!

02:11.709 --> 02:14.749
The antimatter hyperdrive
can't take those numbers!

02:14.750 --> 02:18.249
For the love of God, man,
tell them to stop subscribing.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.207
Wait, what?
How many?

02:20.208 --> 02:22.541
Two million!

02:22.542 --> 02:24.582
Yes! Two million
of you insaniacs

02:24.583 --> 02:26.416
have volunteered to get my head

02:26.417 --> 02:28.332
delivered to your heads
on a daily basis.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.874
So, I just wanna say thank you,

02:29.875 --> 02:32.332
gracias, Merci, danke, arigato.

02:32.333 --> 02:33.874
And while this is
Hoffman's Head,

02:33.875 --> 02:37.332
it would not be possible
without Kiki Lee

02:37.333 --> 02:39.207
and the incurable Lyle Burris.

02:39.208 --> 02:41.499
Give 'em some love. Whoo!

02:41.500 --> 02:43.207
But of course, Oh.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.374
The real people I couldn't
have done this without...

02:45.375 --> 02:46.416
is you guys.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.249
My Headlights.
The Hoffman-heads.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.958
I mean it. I-I really can't
believe you're all out there

02:50.959 --> 02:52.457
carrying my head
around in your pockets,

02:52.458 --> 02:54.249
and checking in with my head
at your desks.

02:54.250 --> 02:55.916
It's... it's crazy.

02:55.917 --> 02:56.999
But you have changed my life,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.749
and you have made
my dreams come true.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.582
And I love you guys.

03:01.583 --> 03:04.708
I really do!
I really do.

03:04.709 --> 03:06.249
Like a lot.

03:09.959 --> 03:11.249
That's gross.

03:24.083 --> 03:25.125
Hello.

03:26.375 --> 03:27.582
Hi.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.374
Hi.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.499
Uh, Box 1754, please.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.624
Oh.

03:34.625 --> 03:36.332
Yeah, I've been trying
to figure you out.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.834
Oh, don't do that.

03:39.917 --> 03:42.958
I really couldn't resist.

03:42.959 --> 03:45.458
So, what did you come up with?

03:48.458 --> 03:49.749
Well, I...

03:49.750 --> 03:52.708
I thought you might run
a mental hospital for teenagers.

03:52.709 --> 03:53.959
Kind of, yeah.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.666
Uh, I'm on YouTube.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.708
Well, what are you?
A LOLcat?

03:58.709 --> 04:01.207
What, you don't think I could
be a LOLcat?

04:01.208 --> 04:02.332
I can haz cheeseburger.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.624
Oh, really?
Yeah.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.791
This is America, and you
can be whatever you dream.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.625
Thank you.
Yeah, rock on.

04:12.083 --> 04:13.499
I'm Garrett.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.332
Shell.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.666
"Shell"?

04:17.666 --> 04:19.458
I'm Michelle, but...

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Uh...

04:23.333 --> 04:25.165
Hydrology.

04:25.166 --> 04:26.708
Your... your book.

04:26.709 --> 04:28.582
You like fluid mechanics?

04:28.583 --> 04:29.999
You... yeah!

04:30.000 --> 04:31.290
Yes! It's great. I love it.

04:31.291 --> 04:33.125
What is your favorite
thing about it?

04:35.291 --> 04:36.250
One thing.

04:36.251 --> 04:37.332
One thing.
One thing.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.040
Um...

04:39.041 --> 04:41.375
My favorite thing about
fluid mechanics... Yes?

04:42.417 --> 04:44.124
Is?
Is

04:44.125 --> 04:46.005
the mechanics of it all.
The mechanics.

04:48.291 --> 04:49.416
Hoffman's Head? That's you?

04:49.417 --> 04:51.499
Mm-hmm. That's my head.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.124
I will check it out.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.666
And if I like it, I'll put
kissy lips on a postcard

04:55.667 --> 04:57.083
and... and leave it in your box.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.417
Okay.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.542
Okay!

05:11.083 --> 05:12.709
Can I borrow that?

05:14.375 --> 05:17.249
Um, this is my number.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.332
You know, just in case.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.000
Something happens?

05:23.667 --> 05:26.249
Uh, that's private, okay?

05:26.250 --> 05:27.875
Sure.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.208
Okay.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.916
So what happens
after all of this ends?

05:36.917 --> 05:38.457
Because you know, spoiler alert!

05:38.458 --> 05:41.582
Okay. You know, what if
YouTube isn't just some fad?

05:41.583 --> 05:42.583
What if it's like...

05:42.584 --> 05:44.708
It's the invention
of the printing press?

05:44.709 --> 05:45.958
And I'm in on it.

05:45.959 --> 05:48.582
Well, then, that makes me
a monk in a monastery

05:48.583 --> 05:50.999
illuminating manuscripts.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.082
Please just promise me

05:52.083 --> 05:54.833
you'll consider
a teaching degree.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.290
I just think you should have
something to fall back on.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.792
Would you just stop
for a minute, Dad?

06:02.083 --> 06:03.374
Try the sandwich.

06:03.375 --> 06:04.916
I'll have it for dinner.

06:04.917 --> 06:07.290
It's your favorite
from Arthur's.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.541
Can you please just look at it?

06:11.542 --> 06:13.291
Look at the sandwich?
Yeah.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.750
What is this?
Open it.

06:34.125 --> 06:35.582
Huh!

06:35.583 --> 06:37.291
I told you things
were going really well.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.207
I can't take this, Garrett.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.290
You put it away.
No!

06:43.291 --> 06:44.624
Put it away for yourself.
No, no, no.

06:44.625 --> 06:46.499
I'm fine. I'm investing...

06:46.500 --> 06:47.792
in your store.

06:51.458 --> 06:54.625
Whoever's giving you
financial advice is a moron.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.541
Look, I know you don't get it,

06:57.542 --> 06:59.708
but all my life...

06:59.709 --> 07:02.499
everybody's been worried about how I
was gonna survive in the real world.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.457
Right? Including me.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.791
Now all of a sudden, all that stuff
everyone told me to quit doing,

07:07.792 --> 07:09.666
like clowning around,
playing video games,

07:09.667 --> 07:12.542
that's like... that's a
real thing that people do.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.290
I'm good at this.
I'm really good at this.

07:17.291 --> 07:19.208
Have you seen any of my videos?

07:20.250 --> 07:21.999
A lot of people like them.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.166
A lot of people
like a lot of things.

07:31.375 --> 07:32.833
Thanks for the sandwich.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.667
You're welcome.

07:44.041 --> 07:46.040
Come on, little goblins!

07:46.041 --> 07:47.499
Good job, man. Good.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.624
How did you just do that?

07:48.625 --> 07:51.124
Unlocked the goblin outrage.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.416
Yes. Fuck you. Fuck you.

07:54.417 --> 07:55.709
And I'm large!

07:57.000 --> 07:59.040
But why is he dead?

07:59.041 --> 08:01.249
I won, but the guy's like...

08:01.250 --> 08:03.457
on the floor, dead.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.000
Okay.

08:06.542 --> 08:07.749
Alright.

08:07.750 --> 08:11.374
Okay, so we got about 4,000
people on the stream right now.

08:11.375 --> 08:13.541
Live here in Hoffman's Head.

08:13.542 --> 08:16.040
Streaming from 9:00 p.m. until
"I just can't take it anymore"

08:16.041 --> 08:17.874
every Friday night.

08:17.875 --> 08:21.666
So, I've been trying
to cope with some existential issues.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.207
I'm just gonna throw
that out to you guys.

08:23.208 --> 08:26.374
You night birds and mysterians
out there in the webisphere.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.958
Um, the topic is my life.

08:29.959 --> 08:31.582
What do I do with it?

08:31.583 --> 08:33.082
After YouTube? Chime in.

08:33.082 --> 08:36.582
Dude, you're, like,
living the dream, okay?

08:36.582 --> 08:38.416
I am. I am.

08:38.417 --> 08:41.916
But sometimes people
in your life can be...

08:41.917 --> 08:43.249
human alarm clocks.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.290
Are we talking about girlfriends,
Garrett, or relatives?

08:46.291 --> 08:48.165
Relatives, yes, exactly!

08:48.166 --> 08:49.416
Emotional kryptonite.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.916
They... they come from
the same distant planet as you,

08:51.917 --> 08:53.749
so they can just take away
your powers.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.958
Garrett, you can always
come live with us.

08:55.959 --> 08:57.416
Can I?

08:57.417 --> 08:59.499
And who is "us" exactly?

08:59.500 --> 09:02.916
Me, my mother,
my father, my brother.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.207
Okay.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.040
That sounds awful, thank you.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.958
Oh, hey, it's FanGirl!

09:07.959 --> 09:09.499
Just what you need.
Hey, FanGirl.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.374
Hey, Garrett.
I'm in your head again.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.040
Yes, you are.

09:14.041 --> 09:15.374
Been a while.
Where have you been?

09:15.375 --> 09:17.499
Making some moves.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.082
But I'm back.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.958
I'm here for you, Garrett,
just say the word,

09:20.959 --> 09:23.374
and I am at your door.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.708
As always, FanGirl,
you're turning me on,

09:25.709 --> 09:28.624
and creeping me out in equal measure.
It's a gift.

09:28.625 --> 09:31.207
Yo, she's probably
like 50 years old and ugly.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.332
Only one way to find out.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.249
You do know I have a rule,
right, FanGirl?

09:35.250 --> 09:37.791
Well, rules
are made to be broken.

09:37.792 --> 09:39.082
Thing is, FanGirl,

09:39.083 --> 09:41.082
I made up the rule
for your benefit.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.708
It protects you from the
inevitable disappointment,

09:43.709 --> 09:45.332
because you guys already
get the best of me.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.749
What's left in the day
is just, like,

09:46.750 --> 09:48.666
14 hours swinging the mouse.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.833
I am not...
I'm not interesting.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.791
Well, I could give
you a back rub as you work.

09:53.792 --> 09:56.165
Or I could get on my knees...

09:56.166 --> 09:58.708
in front of your chair
and use my...

09:58.709 --> 10:00.249
Okay, okay!

10:00.250 --> 10:01.999
As delightful
as that would be...

10:02.000 --> 10:04.332
Oh, now...
Now Raveon's jealous.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.332
See, this is why
we have the rule.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.999
I love you all equally.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.082
I can't pick one Headlight
over another.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.249
Just can't.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.207
But there's no
one else like me, Garrett.

10:13.208 --> 10:15.458
And deep down, you know it.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.791
You know, I honestly don't know

10:18.792 --> 10:20.542
what I know anymore, FanGirl.

10:21.834 --> 10:24.040
Except that you're
all out there.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.542
And that makes me feel
like I'm home.

10:29.375 --> 10:33.582
Okay, imagine,
like, living in this world.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.457
And having to actually, like,

10:35.458 --> 10:37.374
fight these goblins.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.082
Just on a daily basis.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.208
It's really good.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.207
It's the worst date food
ever, right?

11:07.208 --> 11:08.916
I didn't want to say anything,

11:08.917 --> 11:10.749
but it is!
Oh! What was I thinking?

11:10.750 --> 11:13.833
Gosh! No, no, no. It's
really delicious.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.040
I know.
Really good.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.250
I love it.
That's why I come here, but...

11:18.333 --> 11:19.457
I'm an idiot.

11:19.458 --> 11:20.749
Yeah.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.250
But the good kind.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.499
Okay, so, what the fuck
is hydrology?

11:28.500 --> 11:30.332
Um, it is the, uh...

11:30.333 --> 11:33.124
the part of fluid mechanics
that tries to make sense

11:33.125 --> 11:37.291
of how liquids, gasses and
plasmas react to applied forces.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.791
You say "plasmas" so casually.

11:40.792 --> 11:43.249
Most people I know
use plasmas to blast aliens.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.375
Well, you say "aliens"
so casually.

11:46.917 --> 11:48.040
True.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.625
Are you with anyone?

11:57.083 --> 11:59.417
Lately it kind of feels
like I'm with everyone.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.165
If that makes any sense.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.582
Yeah.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.290
Just haven't found
the one yet, huh?

12:05.291 --> 12:07.999
I don't even know
if there is a one.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.124
I mean, yes, of course,
to control the Matrix.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.791
Mm-hmm.
You know, but...

12:11.792 --> 12:14.874
Yeah, but, you... you don't think
there's such a thing as true love?

12:14.875 --> 12:17.625
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.582
But is it forever?

12:20.583 --> 12:24.249
I don't know.
Do you only get one?

12:24.250 --> 12:26.250
Well, more than one
would be complicated.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.500
Sorry. Excuse me, I...

12:36.083 --> 12:38.624
And what are you doing?
Texting Number Two?

12:38.625 --> 12:41.916
No, you... you gave me
an idea for a bit.

12:41.917 --> 12:43.499
So, we all have this mythology

12:43.500 --> 12:45.666
that there's, like, one perfect
person out there for us.

12:45.667 --> 12:48.040
Mm-hmm. But what if
there's, like, five?

12:48.041 --> 12:49.290
Five?
Yes.

12:49.291 --> 12:51.499
So you could have, like, four...
Four perfect girlfriends,

12:51.500 --> 12:53.125
but you still need
a number five!

12:55.625 --> 12:57.500
Sorry, hang on.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.542
So this... this is where
it all happens.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.624
So... the "Rule."

13:26.625 --> 13:27.833
Is that real?

13:27.834 --> 13:31.624
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's real.

13:31.625 --> 13:34.457
You wouldn't go out
with one of those girls?

13:34.458 --> 13:36.541
It just...
It doesn't feel right,

13:36.542 --> 13:39.165
like it would be taking
advantage somehow.

13:39.166 --> 13:42.250
That girl, who sent you
her panties every week?

13:43.250 --> 13:45.040
And um...

13:45.041 --> 13:46.791
FanGirl on the livestream?

13:46.792 --> 13:49.124
Y-you're not tempted?

13:49.125 --> 13:51.207
I don't know what they want.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.165
Maybe just to make you happy.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.791
They don't even know me!

13:54.792 --> 13:56.375
What don't they know?

14:00.709 --> 14:01.749
Well...

14:01.750 --> 14:04.041
not that much, actually.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.165
You okay with all this?

14:07.166 --> 14:08.499
What do you mean?

14:08.500 --> 14:10.416
You know, if you get
involved with me,

14:10.417 --> 14:12.958
you get involved in all this.

14:12.959 --> 14:16.332
My whole life,
it gets likes and comments.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.792
So you think
we are getting involved.

14:21.583 --> 14:22.875
I like you.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.250
Yeah?

14:26.834 --> 14:28.875
Yeah, you seem real.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.709
I am real.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.125
Good morning.

15:45.667 --> 15:48.165
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

15:48.166 --> 15:49.542
I knew it would be.

15:52.208 --> 15:54.834
I told you rules
were made to be broken.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.374
What do you mean?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.375
Oh, come on. You're telling
me you didn't know?

16:03.750 --> 16:05.249
Know what?

16:08.500 --> 16:12.709
Hey, Garrett. I'm in your head again...
and in your bed.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.040
What the hell are you doing?

16:15.041 --> 16:16.709
Being me.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.541
I'm sorry, um...

16:23.542 --> 16:25.416
I'm kinda freaking out here.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.374
You really didn't know?
No!

16:27.375 --> 16:30.708
Jesus, no! FanGirl lives
in... in Chicago!

16:30.709 --> 16:32.791
Not anymore. I moved here.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.749
I quit school, and I moved
here, and I took that job

16:35.750 --> 16:37.666
so we could do this
with no rules.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.708
You... you what? I'm sorry?

16:39.709 --> 16:41.207
You can't tell me
it wasn't good.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.750
No, that... that was fucked up.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.374
Is you name even
really Michelle?

16:45.375 --> 16:46.582
Of course it is.

16:46.583 --> 16:47.791
I didn't lie to you.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.416
I-I just told you some truths
you didn't know yet.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.749
What?

16:52.750 --> 16:55.416
Listen, y-you gotta go. Sorry.

16:55.417 --> 16:57.040
Are you kidding me?

16:57.041 --> 16:59.499
No, seriously. You gotta
get the fuck outta here.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.124
Why? Because you
fucking stalked me.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.332
No. I met you.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.207
How else was I supposed
to meet you, Garrett?

17:06.208 --> 17:08.582
I don't know. Honestly?
How?

17:08.583 --> 17:09.541
You had a rule,

17:09.542 --> 17:10.999
and if... if I didn't
do something,

17:11.000 --> 17:12.415
we would never
have had last night.

17:12.416 --> 17:14.249
Last night was bullshit.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.165
You know that's not true.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.958
You felt something.
I know you did.

17:17.959 --> 17:20.207
Actually, I don't know
what the fuck I felt.

17:20.208 --> 17:21.208
Okay?

17:21.209 --> 17:23.165
Then why don't we figure it out?

17:23.165 --> 17:25.790
Sometimes people
just click, Garrett.

17:25.791 --> 17:27.625
And you can't make
rules for that.

17:28.750 --> 17:29.791
Knock, knock!

17:29.792 --> 17:31.959
Dude, you're not up?
We brought coffee!

17:36.625 --> 17:38.791
What happened to the clock?

17:38.792 --> 17:40.792
This was our special
time together.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.916
Nice almost meeting you.

18:01.917 --> 18:03.916
You, too.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.125
Take care.

18:20.375 --> 18:21.333
You know, sometime soon,

18:21.334 --> 18:23.041
you're going
to regret this, Garrett.

18:24.542 --> 18:27.375
And when that happens,
just know that I'm waiting.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.625
Okay?

18:31.667 --> 18:33.333
Goodbye, Michelle.

18:35.792 --> 18:36.792
Yeah.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.708
I don't know, bro.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.709
I mean...

18:48.710 --> 18:50.124
what'd she do wrong exactly?

18:50.125 --> 18:53.165
So you met online. How's that
any different than Tinder?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.374
Because only one
of us signed up.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.749
Love that doesn't listen.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.708
You like her.

18:59.709 --> 19:03.833
I mean, you guys have been
talking for, what, a year?

19:03.834 --> 19:05.249
You texted.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.833
She... sexted you.

19:07.834 --> 19:09.375
What's your point, Lyle?

19:10.375 --> 19:12.375
Did you ever tell her to stop?

19:16.625 --> 19:18.290
Can we just get to work?

19:18.291 --> 19:20.000
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

19:21.041 --> 19:22.582
Yeah.

19:24.375 --> 19:27.457
Hey, it's Garrett.
Do what you gotta do.

19:27.458 --> 19:28.917
Garrett, listen.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.833
I'm in the top two percentile.

19:33.834 --> 19:35.583
Me and all of my friends.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.208
And we're all so fucked up.

19:41.250 --> 19:45.208
And nobody cares, just as long as
you're perfect on the outside.

19:49.041 --> 19:50.959
I was going
to kill myself, Garrett.

19:51.917 --> 19:54.332
I went to this guy
who sold pills,

19:54.333 --> 19:56.374
and when I got there...

19:56.375 --> 19:58.041
he was watching
your live stream.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.124
And you were just...

20:01.125 --> 20:03.417
connecting with all
of these people.

20:04.792 --> 20:06.374
You didn't give a fuck
what anyone thought.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.749
You were just... connecting.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.416
It didn't matter what
grade you got or...

20:11.417 --> 20:13.458
Or who was going
to stop loving you.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.874
So instead of taking the pills,

20:18.875 --> 20:21.250
I started coming
on the stream as FanGirl.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.749
And then last month,
I decided we had to meet.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.291
We had to see
what it would be like.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.834
Because you saved
my life, Garrett.

20:33.125 --> 20:34.249
I know you have a rule,

20:34.250 --> 20:36.250
but I also know
that I'm in love with you.

20:38.166 --> 20:40.624
And last night,
I think you let yourself

20:40.625 --> 20:42.625
be in love with me, too.

20:45.291 --> 20:46.458
Just a little.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.999
And last
night, I think you let yourself

20:52.000 --> 20:53.500
be in love with me, too.

20:56.667 --> 20:57.792
Just a little.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.208
Call me. Okay?

21:13.583 --> 21:16.708
Do I have a raging
marionette doll fetish?

21:16.709 --> 21:17.667
Yes, I do.

21:17.668 --> 21:19.208
Am I in therapy for it?
Yes, I am.

21:20.333 --> 21:21.374
My therapist recommends having

21:21.375 --> 21:23.124
as many one-night stands
as possible

21:23.125 --> 21:24.958
to help cure me
of my puppet perversion,

21:24.959 --> 21:26.290
but I can't, I won't. I just...

21:26.291 --> 21:28.332
I could never be with a
girl, no strings attached.

22:30.041 --> 22:34.082
Hey, hold up. I'm not exactly
a bathroom kinda guy.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.082
I am so drunk.

22:38.083 --> 22:39.666
Really?

22:40.668 --> 22:44.582
I'll, uh...
I'll take you home.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.374
Whoa! Come on.

23:53.166 --> 23:56.124
Fucking man-eaters
everywhere I turn.

23:56.125 --> 23:58.667
Eat me! You're not gonna
eat me today!

24:00.041 --> 24:01.791
Everywhere.

24:01.792 --> 24:03.833
Okay, please, God.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.040
Zombies.

24:07.041 --> 24:08.499
All up in it.

24:09.959 --> 24:12.458
Alright, where are we now?

24:14.834 --> 24:17.040
It's dark. I can't...

24:17.041 --> 24:19.208
really see anything
in this hallway.

24:25.709 --> 24:26.709
Okay.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.709
I see some sort of light.

24:31.333 --> 24:33.040
It's like a...

24:33.041 --> 24:34.916
A doorway.

24:34.917 --> 24:37.207
Boo!

24:37.208 --> 24:39.207
Oh, what the fuck?

24:39.208 --> 24:40.666
I said "hello" like ten times.

24:40.667 --> 24:42.207
I didn't...
I didn't hear you.

24:42.208 --> 24:43.833
Anyways, brought
your drive back.

24:43.834 --> 24:45.999
Thanks.
Whatcha playing?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.290
"Dead Rising." Fuck!

24:48.291 --> 24:50.082
You fucking scared me.

24:50.083 --> 24:51.250
Sorry, dude.

25:14.625 --> 25:16.040
Garrett Hoffman?

25:16.041 --> 25:18.040
Yeah.
Police.

25:18.041 --> 25:19.958
Detective Yarden.

25:19.959 --> 25:21.958
And then...

25:21.959 --> 25:23.625
after she threw up?

25:24.709 --> 25:25.749
I left.

25:25.750 --> 25:27.082
I was home before midnight.

25:27.083 --> 25:30.290
Don't suppose there's anyone
who can confirm that for us?

25:30.291 --> 25:33.040
Yeah. Uh, the girl
that was here before.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.624
She was over late.

25:34.625 --> 25:36.666
Pink hair?
Yeah, we work together.

25:36.667 --> 25:38.249
Editing till around 2:00.

25:38.250 --> 25:40.749
She can testify to that.
We... we have edit logs,

25:40.750 --> 25:44.249
and you can see when we uploaded.
Alright.

25:44.250 --> 25:45.917
Write down her name and number.

25:48.792 --> 25:50.959
Looks like this was
just a botched robbery.

25:52.166 --> 25:53.457
But you were the last person

25:53.458 --> 25:55.749
seen with the victim
at the club.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.040
I... I didn't even know
her last name.

25:58.041 --> 25:59.207
Well, I hate to say it,

25:59.208 --> 26:01.749
but in this case,
that's a good thing.

26:01.750 --> 26:05.833
First person we look for
is someone who knew the victim.

26:05.834 --> 26:08.791
Yeah, it doesn't really feel
like a good thing.

26:08.792 --> 26:11.374
That's because
you're not an asshole,

26:11.375 --> 26:13.458
which is the second thing
that we look for.

26:20.792 --> 26:23.624
How many people
watch your, uh, show?

26:23.625 --> 26:25.374
Two million.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.165
That's about a million girls.

26:27.166 --> 26:29.499
No, I don't do that.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.542
Not with fans.

26:31.834 --> 26:33.333
Why the hell not?

27:23.542 --> 27:25.917
Hi, this is, um...

27:27.750 --> 27:29.708
FanGirl.

27:29.709 --> 27:31.541
Found it.

27:31.542 --> 27:34.999
- Got it. Found the lock.
- Great job.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.709
One second,
one second. Hold on.

27:40.208 --> 27:41.624
Um...

27:41.625 --> 27:44.749
welcome to the casa de Lyle.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.541
Uh...

27:46.542 --> 27:48.874
One second, one second.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:55.250 --> 27:56.999
Mmm. Hey!

27:57.000 --> 27:58.917
Where's that, uh, killer scotch?

28:00.083 --> 28:01.417
Right!

28:05.750 --> 28:07.208
So...

28:08.917 --> 28:10.417
about Garrett.

28:11.417 --> 28:12.583
Well, fuck him.

28:14.417 --> 28:16.291
I thought the idea was fuck me.

28:17.625 --> 28:18.875
Same thing.

28:20.291 --> 28:21.625
Yes, it is.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.290
Is your bathroom clean?
Absolutely.

28:25.291 --> 28:26.416
Mm-hmm.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.416
I'm not going to, uh...
To run into anything

28:28.417 --> 28:30.416
we're both going
to regret, am I?

28:30.417 --> 28:32.499
No.
Oh.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.125
But hang on.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.207
Oh!

29:20.208 --> 29:21.916
Oh! No!

29:21.917 --> 29:23.833
No, Moose, no!

29:23.834 --> 29:25.499
Get off me! Get off!

29:25.500 --> 29:26.833
Oh!

29:26.834 --> 29:29.000
Die!

29:34.375 --> 29:37.416
Okay! Thank you for letting
us into your devices.

29:47.291 --> 29:48.291
Got it!

29:48.292 --> 29:49.708
That is a wrap.

29:51.208 --> 29:52.499
Catch, much?

29:52.500 --> 29:55.249
I... I had a rough night.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.874
You okay?

29:56.875 --> 29:59.249
Yeah, it's just... allergies.

29:59.250 --> 30:00.582
I'll be fine.

30:02.834 --> 30:03.958
You okay?

30:03.959 --> 30:06.000
Yeah, um...

30:07.667 --> 30:10.666
I'm just trying to figure out
if I screwed something up.

30:10.667 --> 30:12.874
Well, don't be a wuss.

30:12.875 --> 30:15.667
I mean, don't be an asshole,
but don't be a wuss.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.082
That's not really helping.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.208
Not really my job.

30:39.834 --> 30:43.165
Hey, this is Garrett Hoffman.

30:43.166 --> 30:45.083
Hey, this is Garrett Hoffman.

30:46.250 --> 30:48.208
Hey, this is Garrett Hoffman.

30:49.250 --> 30:51.291
Hey, this is Garrett Hoffman.

30:52.333 --> 30:53.583
Hey, this is...

30:59.125 --> 31:00.291
Hey there, you.

31:01.417 --> 31:03.290
Hey.

31:03.291 --> 31:05.416
Uh, your text yesterday.

31:05.417 --> 31:08.165
I'm sorry. There was
some stuff going on.

31:08.166 --> 31:10.290
Are you okay?

31:10.291 --> 31:11.582
Yeah.

31:11.583 --> 31:13.082
No, it's just...

31:13.083 --> 31:14.874
What is it?

31:14.875 --> 31:18.290
I met this girl, and...

31:18.291 --> 31:21.500
And she died. Uh, she was
killed in, like, a robbery.

31:26.458 --> 31:27.666
Were you close?

31:27.667 --> 31:29.499
No, I was just
at this club for Lyle,

31:29.500 --> 31:31.499
and she was drunk,
so I took her home,

31:31.500 --> 31:33.874
you know, because
she couldn't drive.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.125
And then...

31:36.458 --> 31:38.624
It's just so insane.
It's like being on the corner

31:38.625 --> 31:39.958
and seeing somebody
get hit by a bus.

31:39.959 --> 31:42.416
It was just this random...

31:42.417 --> 31:44.416
I'm so sorry.

31:44.417 --> 31:46.207
No, it's... it's okay.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.457
It was like
a wake-up call.

31:48.458 --> 31:49.458
You know?

31:49.459 --> 31:50.958
I just wanted to call you
and let you know

31:50.959 --> 31:53.416
that I wasn't blowing you off.

31:53.417 --> 31:55.792
Uh, I have been thinking
about what happened with us.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.249
Me too.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.499
I was really freaked out.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.499
And maybe I overreacted,

32:01.500 --> 32:03.375
or I'm not being fair.

32:04.375 --> 32:06.000
I don't know. I just...

32:07.166 --> 32:08.667
So, what do we do?

32:09.625 --> 32:11.375
Maybe we try again.

32:12.959 --> 32:14.291
And take it slow.

32:15.583 --> 32:16.709
I'd like that.

32:24.166 --> 32:27.749
Uh, listen, I gotta go,
but I'll call you later, okay?

32:27.750 --> 32:29.208
I'm here.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.249
Hi.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.791
We love your videos.
We love your videos.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.791
Thank you. Thanks.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.499
You wanna do...

32:59.625 --> 33:01.083
I'm here.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.456
This is Garrett Hoffman.

34:38.458 --> 34:41.291
This is Garrett Hoffman.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.417
This is Garrett Hoffman.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.833
This is Garrett Hoffman.

34:48.833 --> 34:50.375
This is Garrett Hoffman.

34:51.833 --> 34:53.458
This is Garrett Hoffman.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.625
This is Garrett Hoffman.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.709
This is Garrett Hoffman.

35:00.875 --> 35:02.542
This is Garrett Hoffman.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.667
This is Garrett Hoffman.

35:07.041 --> 35:08.792
This is Garrett Hoffman.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.709
This is Garrett Hoffman.

35:12.917 --> 35:14.667
This is Garrett Hoffman.

35:15.834 --> 35:17.625
This is Garrett Hoffman.

35:29.375 --> 35:31.083
I let it go to voicemail.

35:33.041 --> 35:34.583
I'm wet.

35:40.375 --> 35:41.750
Garrett?

35:55.333 --> 35:56.375
What the fuck?

35:57.667 --> 35:59.207
Shh, it's okay.

35:59.208 --> 36:00.499
No, no, no. It's not okay!

36:00.500 --> 36:01.874
Hey.

36:01.875 --> 36:03.499
You called me.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.040
What?

36:05.041 --> 36:07.708
You called me. You said
you wanted to try again.

36:07.709 --> 36:10.332
I... yeah! Like coffee.

36:10.333 --> 36:12.625
Come on, Garrett.
We're way beyond coff...

36:14.917 --> 36:16.709
How the hell did you
even get in here?

36:17.750 --> 36:20.874
Okay, fine. Forget it!

36:20.875 --> 36:22.541
Wait, what? You're mad?

36:22.542 --> 36:24.749
I am giving you everything,

36:24.750 --> 36:26.916
and you are giving me nothing.

36:26.917 --> 36:28.958
You're playing fucking
mind games, Garrett!

36:28.959 --> 36:30.124
You know what? Fuck you!

36:30.125 --> 36:31.541
I deserve better.
Nuh-uh.

36:31.542 --> 36:33.332
I'm not playing
mind games, Michelle.

36:33.333 --> 36:34.499
Shell!
Shell. Fuck.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.582
I'm fucking confused.
No shit.

36:37.583 --> 36:38.624
Could you just wait a second?

36:38.625 --> 36:41.124
No, fuck you!
You're a fucking sociopath!

36:41.125 --> 36:44.082
Y-y-you're selfish,
and you... you use people!

36:44.083 --> 36:45.958
You use everybody!

36:45.959 --> 36:47.917
I gave up everything for you!

36:49.250 --> 36:50.416
Who asked you to?

36:50.417 --> 36:52.040
Oh my God!

36:52.041 --> 36:53.290
Whoa. Whoa!

36:56.792 --> 36:57.999
Oh my...

36:58.000 --> 37:00.165
Jesus, Garrett.
I didn't do that.

37:00.166 --> 37:02.124
God!
I swear I did not do that.

37:02.125 --> 37:03.958
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay, it's okay.

37:03.959 --> 37:05.749
Let me see, let me see.
I'm sorry.

37:05.750 --> 37:07.416
Sorry.
Shit.

37:11.291 --> 37:13.082
I'm getting blood on everything.

37:13.083 --> 37:14.958
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

37:14.959 --> 37:17.499
Yeah, I think we need
to get you to a doctor though.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.708
No, no. We can just
wrap it up. It's fine.

37:19.709 --> 37:21.624
You're gonna need stitches.
It's fine.

37:21.625 --> 37:24.207
Shell...
I can't.

37:24.208 --> 37:26.916
They'll ask me how it happened
and who did this to me,

37:26.917 --> 37:29.667
and I am bad at lying, Garrett.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.500
Just help me get home.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.666
I feel so stupid.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.833
No, it was an accident.

38:05.834 --> 38:07.874
The... no, the whole thing...

38:07.875 --> 38:10.499
Moving here, finding you.

38:10.500 --> 38:14.457
You need help going back?
Like, expenses or anything?

38:14.458 --> 38:16.333
No, thank you.

38:18.458 --> 38:19.875
I love you.

38:21.250 --> 38:22.374
Okay.

38:22.375 --> 38:23.499
I... I mean, I get it.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.499
I wasn't talking about
anything happening.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.875
I was just, you know...

38:27.917 --> 38:29.542
expressing a feeling.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.041
You're a good guy, and...

38:34.917 --> 38:36.417
I'm gonna be okay.

38:37.542 --> 38:39.083
Yeah.

38:43.125 --> 38:44.542
Do you know what I need?

38:46.375 --> 38:47.875
An ice cream soda.

38:49.458 --> 38:50.542
Do you want one?

38:52.417 --> 38:54.667
Just a parting ice cream soda.

38:57.417 --> 38:59.083
Yeah. Yeah, sounds good.

39:47.625 --> 39:50.040
You slept with a girl
that you met on the Internet.

39:50.041 --> 39:52.833
You don't want to sleep with
her anymore, so she's pissed.

39:52.834 --> 39:55.165
No, no, no.
This is like a stalker.

39:55.166 --> 39:57.207
Okay? I'm famous.

39:57.208 --> 39:59.207
Has she threatened you?

39:59.208 --> 40:01.959
Yeah. Yeah, she told me
she'll never stop loving me.

40:02.959 --> 40:05.791
Has she threatened you
with anything bad?

40:05.792 --> 40:07.958
No.
Alright, look.

40:07.959 --> 40:11.791
Son, with all due
respect to your fame,

40:11.792 --> 40:14.040
this is more or less
a domestic situation.

40:14.041 --> 40:16.541
Okay, yes, but...
Well, we hate those.

40:16.542 --> 40:17.624
It's all he-said, she-said,

40:17.625 --> 40:19.874
and then someone
recants in the next day.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.082
Alright, well if she drugged
me, is that not a crime?

40:22.083 --> 40:23.749
Absolutely.
Then do a blood test.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.374
It only proves that
you took a drug,

40:25.375 --> 40:26.457
not that she gave it to you.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.290
Well, then, what about
a restraining order?

40:28.291 --> 40:30.165
On what grounds?

40:30.166 --> 40:31.791
Well, she broke into my house.

40:31.792 --> 40:33.332
He said.

40:33.333 --> 40:35.374
She said,
"He invited me in."

40:35.375 --> 40:36.875
Oh, God.

40:38.709 --> 40:39.958
We had this girl,

40:39.959 --> 40:41.999
very bright,

40:42.000 --> 40:43.457
putting herself
through medical school

40:43.458 --> 40:45.374
working at a lap dance joint.

40:45.375 --> 40:46.708
She gets this customer

40:46.709 --> 40:50.124
who has a bad sense
of boundaries.

40:50.125 --> 40:51.374
This is a very determined girl,

40:51.375 --> 40:54.499
and she's not gonna let
some loser derail her dreams.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.791
So, one night when
she sees him in the parking lot

40:57.792 --> 40:59.499
waiting for her after work,

40:59.500 --> 41:03.040
I'll bet that the last thing
that went through her head...

41:03.041 --> 41:04.874
I mean before the bullet...

41:04.875 --> 41:07.750
Was "No, I have
a restraining order."

41:08.834 --> 41:10.250
Don't fuel the fire.

41:11.208 --> 41:13.165
Don't communicate.

41:13.166 --> 41:16.207
Don't go where you might
run into each other.

41:16.208 --> 41:18.582
We run into each other
on the Internet.

41:18.583 --> 41:22.249
Well, maybe you should take
a couple months off of that.

41:22.250 --> 41:24.917
A couple of months? It'll
be there when you get back.

43:28.834 --> 43:30.582
Man, just got trashed.

43:30.583 --> 43:31.791
Uh, I'm in a lake of ooze here.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.207
Is somebody gonna
come heal me please?

43:33.208 --> 43:34.624
What was that?

43:34.625 --> 43:36.582
That was like a giant worm at
the end of the tunnel. Mom!

43:36.583 --> 43:38.708
- I'm playing a game!
- The game can wait.

43:38.709 --> 43:40.165
Please tell Jerry
to take out the trash.

43:40.166 --> 43:41.166
Jerry did it yesterday.

43:41.167 --> 43:43.499
Fine, fine, fine. Sorry, guys.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.082
I'm out. I'm out.

43:45.083 --> 43:47.165
Bye, Brute.
Later, Brute.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.833
Welcome RealGirl.
Maybe we can cheer you up.

43:49.834 --> 43:52.541
Petunia's in some trouble
on her quest over by the...

43:52.542 --> 43:55.290
Garrett, you can't keep
shutting me out.

43:55.291 --> 43:57.457
We made love, and...
And you were inside me,

43:57.458 --> 43:59.000
and I know you felt it too.

43:59.959 --> 44:01.499
What the fuck was that?

44:01.500 --> 44:03.332
That was sudden.

44:03.333 --> 44:05.207
You okay, Garrett?

44:05.208 --> 44:07.207
Uh...

44:07.208 --> 44:08.499
I'm sorry. I, uh...

44:08.500 --> 44:10.749
I gotta cut it short tonight,
Headlights. I gotta go.

44:17.083 --> 44:18.500
Fuck!

44:20.250 --> 44:22.040
Um...

44:22.041 --> 44:23.582
this is a public video

44:23.583 --> 44:25.041
for Garrett Hoffman.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.583
I didn't want to do this, but...

44:30.583 --> 44:32.417
you won't talk to me.

44:34.458 --> 44:38.250
It feels like my heart
has been ripped out of my body.

44:42.417 --> 44:45.542
We both made mistakes,
so please, please...

44:47.000 --> 44:48.624
I'm sorry I upset you.

44:48.625 --> 44:51.582
I'm begging you,
let's just try again.

44:54.333 --> 44:55.749
I'm begging you...

44:55.750 --> 44:57.874
let's just try again.

44:57.875 --> 45:00.582
My heart has
been ripped right out of my body.

45:00.583 --> 45:02.916
Oh God! oh!

45:02.917 --> 45:04.416
It has!

45:04.417 --> 45:06.666
It causes friction between
me and my girlfriend.

45:06.667 --> 45:08.791
Then she gets involved
in a... "Friction."

45:08.792 --> 45:11.374
Then she gets involved in a
threesome with my girl and I.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.958
Why haven't you stalked me?

45:13.959 --> 45:15.541
Why, Shell? What?

45:15.542 --> 45:16.999
Watching this video

45:17.000 --> 45:18.290
was just cringe-worthy.

45:18.291 --> 45:20.249
No wonder this guy's
not calling you back, girl.

45:20.250 --> 45:21.499
You be crazy.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.582
I didn't want to do this,
but you won't talk to me.

45:23.583 --> 45:24.958
Oh my God, oh my God.

45:24.959 --> 45:27.874
It feels like my heart
has been ripped out of my body.

45:27.875 --> 45:30.833
Sword. Sword is not working.
Axe! Axe is not working.

45:30.834 --> 45:33.082
We both made mistakes.
I'm sorry I upset you.

45:33.083 --> 45:34.791
Okay, just gonna get
the big ol' bazooka.

45:34.792 --> 45:37.124
Let's just try again.
Ah! I'm out of ammo!

45:37.125 --> 45:38.749
This game is torture.

45:38.750 --> 45:41.207
Maybe we just have
more feelings than other people.

45:41.208 --> 45:42.624
You know,
I've always been like that.

45:42.625 --> 45:44.124
Everything is...
Is more intense.

45:44.125 --> 45:46.666
I understand.

45:46.667 --> 45:48.708
You can have...

45:48.709 --> 45:51.624
anybody you want, and...
And why give that up?

45:51.625 --> 45:55.416
Because having everything
is like having nothing, Garrett.

45:55.417 --> 45:57.207
What defines you?

45:57.208 --> 45:58.332
Your choices.

45:58.333 --> 45:59.958
Who are you, Garrett?

45:59.959 --> 46:03.582
There's this Garrett that people
see, and that's not you, is it?

46:03.583 --> 46:06.999
You know how hard it is
to see you here every day?

46:07.000 --> 46:10.040
I... I can't move on,

46:10.041 --> 46:12.499
because you won't
let me, Garrett.

46:12.500 --> 46:13.624
You said like you.

46:13.625 --> 46:15.916
You said to share
and follow you.

46:15.917 --> 46:17.457
You fucking lied.

46:23.125 --> 46:24.332
Look, Miss.

46:24.333 --> 46:26.124
What you need
to understand is that

46:26.125 --> 46:28.040
he does not see what happened

46:28.041 --> 46:29.958
in the same way that you do.

46:29.959 --> 46:31.625
But he told me to move here.

46:33.125 --> 46:34.207
I beg your pardon?

46:34.208 --> 46:37.165
Well, he, like, practically
begged me for months.

46:37.166 --> 46:41.250
Look, what you may have misinterpreted
as his... No, no, look for yourself.

46:49.792 --> 46:51.457
These are your emails, correct?

46:51.458 --> 46:52.791
That you sent?

46:52.792 --> 46:55.290
Six months ago?
Eight months ago?

46:55.291 --> 46:57.749
Asking her to move here
because you love her.

46:57.750 --> 46:58.999
No, no, no.
She messed with it.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.541
I... I did not write these.

47:00.542 --> 47:02.165
She was here, I told you that.

47:02.166 --> 47:03.791
Kid, you remember
when I told you

47:03.792 --> 47:06.332
about why we hate
domestic situations?

47:06.333 --> 47:08.708
I swear to God, this is
not "he said, she said."

47:08.709 --> 47:09.791
This... this is "he said,"

47:09.792 --> 47:11.457
and then "she broke
into his fucking house

47:11.458 --> 47:14.374
and is fucking with his life because
she's a fucking psychotic stalker."

47:14.375 --> 47:15.833
You expect me to believe that

47:15.834 --> 47:17.165
she got into your email account

47:17.166 --> 47:18.207
somehow and wrote all these?

47:18.208 --> 47:20.374
She backdated your emails?

47:20.375 --> 47:21.582
Come on!

47:21.583 --> 47:23.416
I'll take a lie detector test.

47:23.417 --> 47:25.416
There's gotta be some
kinda forensic way

47:25.417 --> 47:26.582
that you can check when these

47:26.583 --> 47:28.041
were actually written, right?

47:29.709 --> 47:31.874
Alright, I will look into it.

47:31.875 --> 47:35.750
In the meantime,
stay away from this girl.

47:37.458 --> 47:38.999
Okay.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.791
But you do understand
the irony of that, right?

47:41.792 --> 47:43.250
Fuck your irony.

47:44.375 --> 47:45.833
Stay put.

47:55.333 --> 47:57.291
He loves me.

47:59.083 --> 48:00.291
We're lovers.

48:01.458 --> 48:02.959
Jesus.

48:12.458 --> 48:13.833
It's gone viral.

48:13.834 --> 48:15.791
Every time I get it
taken down in one place,

48:15.792 --> 48:17.333
it pops up in five more.

48:18.792 --> 48:20.749
We got fan art already.

48:20.750 --> 48:21.999
And remixes.

48:25.875 --> 48:28.040
Channel views way up,

48:28.041 --> 48:30.417
likes way up, subscribes...

48:32.458 --> 48:33.916
Garrett.

48:33.917 --> 48:36.374
It's just this thing you do.

48:36.375 --> 48:37.625
You can walk away.

48:40.500 --> 48:42.625
I connected with
two million people.

48:43.834 --> 48:45.875
I can't just let one
of them destroy that.

48:46.917 --> 48:48.332
No.

48:48.333 --> 48:50.374
Then I'm out.

48:50.375 --> 48:51.500
I can't enable this.

48:52.542 --> 48:53.999
Overreact much?

48:54.000 --> 48:55.333
Shut up, Lyle!

48:57.667 --> 49:00.333
You have to do
what you have to do.

49:14.083 --> 49:16.333
This is so fucked up.

49:17.375 --> 49:19.040
Lyle, can you give me
some space?

49:19.041 --> 49:20.792
Please?

49:23.542 --> 49:24.917
Can you go?
Okay.

49:38.166 --> 49:39.666
Hey.

49:39.667 --> 49:41.040
This is Garrett Hoffman.

49:41.041 --> 49:42.874
As I think you all know by now,

49:42.875 --> 49:44.499
I hooked up with FanGirl,

49:44.500 --> 49:47.207
and it went really badly.

49:47.208 --> 49:48.541
You know, my first instinct is

49:48.542 --> 49:50.958
that this is none of
anybody's fucking business.

49:50.959 --> 49:52.708
Except it is.

49:52.709 --> 49:54.666
You know, I put my life online,

49:54.667 --> 49:56.249
I ask you guys to share.

49:56.250 --> 49:59.332
So, I'm not gonna give up
on what we're doing here,

49:59.333 --> 50:02.916
and I really hope that
you guys don't give up on me.

50:02.917 --> 50:07.249
But I am asking you
to stop making fun of FanGirl.

50:07.250 --> 50:09.916
I believe that this girl
is mentally ill.

50:09.917 --> 50:12.374
This is a damaged person,
and she needs medication,

50:12.375 --> 50:14.708
and I do not mean
that, like, funny.

50:14.709 --> 50:16.082
It's real.

50:16.083 --> 50:17.582
She needs help.

50:17.583 --> 50:20.750
So please...
please lay off.

50:22.041 --> 50:24.833
I believe that this girl
is mentally ill.

50:24.834 --> 50:26.914
This is a damaged person and
she...

50:28.000 --> 50:30.958
I believe that this girl
is mentally ill.

50:30.959 --> 50:32.541
This is a damaged person,
and she...

50:34.000 --> 50:36.249
I believe that this girl
is mentally ill.

52:49.667 --> 52:50.750
Hello?

52:54.583 --> 52:55.833
Jesus.

53:22.417 --> 53:24.458
I might cash that check now.

53:26.625 --> 53:28.083
I'm so sorry.

53:29.458 --> 53:32.333
I didn't... I didn't think
that this could get to you.

53:34.500 --> 53:35.959
What are you talking about?

53:39.792 --> 53:41.582
I'm having a thing...

53:41.583 --> 53:42.959
with a fan. She's...

53:44.083 --> 53:45.750
She's disturbed.

53:47.417 --> 53:51.374
And you think this fan, she...

53:51.375 --> 53:54.332
Wait, wait. How would
she even know that

53:54.333 --> 53:56.290
you father owns a bookstore?

53:56.291 --> 53:57.791
They know everything about me.

53:57.792 --> 53:59.625
Brave new world, Dad.

54:06.583 --> 54:08.834
You know where that's from?

54:10.000 --> 54:11.417
"The Tempest."

54:12.667 --> 54:16.000
"A brave new world
that has such people in it."

54:19.166 --> 54:21.125
I'll take care of this.
I'll stop it.

54:54.208 --> 54:55.667
Shell.

54:57.959 --> 54:59.208
Shell, open up!

55:03.709 --> 55:05.417
Shell, open the fucking door!

55:50.959 --> 55:52.625
You posted the ad?

56:51.458 --> 56:52.458
Hey!

56:54.041 --> 56:55.333
You're dead.

56:56.750 --> 56:59.040
You scared the shit out of me.
Yeah, that was the idea.

56:59.041 --> 57:01.165
Did you get my messages?
Have you been getting mine?

57:01.166 --> 57:02.833
She's gone.
I went to her place.

57:02.834 --> 57:04.457
You broke into her motel room.

57:04.458 --> 57:07.290
Are you serious? She burns down my
father's store and I'm in trouble?

57:07.291 --> 57:09.124
Yeah, you are in trouble.

57:09.125 --> 57:10.332
Are you ready to listen?

57:10.333 --> 57:12.290
Because I've been looking
into your girlfriend

57:12.291 --> 57:13.416
as best I could.

57:13.417 --> 57:15.290
She was a minor,
so the records are sealed.

57:15.291 --> 57:19.290
But there was a fire at the home
of a girl that she didn't like,

57:19.291 --> 57:22.457
and a hit and run against
a boy who broke up with her.

57:22.458 --> 57:23.666
No proof.

57:23.667 --> 57:26.249
Parents put her into a private
psych ward for a while.

57:26.250 --> 57:28.708
Everybody looked the other way.

57:28.709 --> 57:30.124
But that girl at the bar?

57:31.959 --> 57:33.375
The one we thought
was a robbery?

57:38.792 --> 57:40.290
Jesus.
Mm-hmm.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.916
Or the mailbox shop
where you met her.

57:42.917 --> 57:44.958
A woman works there six years,

57:44.959 --> 57:46.749
never misses a day,
then all of a sudden,

57:46.750 --> 57:48.709
she vanishes and a job opens up.

57:50.125 --> 57:52.290
You see this?
You can go online.

57:52.291 --> 57:56.082
Find instructions on how to make
one of these out of a coat hanger.

57:56.083 --> 57:58.207
If that girl really is gone,

57:58.208 --> 57:59.624
count yourself lucky.

57:59.625 --> 58:01.999
And if she comes back, run.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.624
Grow a beard, change your name.

58:04.625 --> 58:05.666
She is bright.

58:05.667 --> 58:08.208
You will not see it coming.

58:25.083 --> 58:27.249
I... I need help.
Somebody's been shot.

58:27.250 --> 58:28.457
A police officer!

58:28.458 --> 58:31.416
He was sh...
Shot with an arrow.

58:31.417 --> 58:32.999
Yes, yes! An arrow.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
It was a crossbow.

58:34.001 --> 58:35.917
It was set up...
in the door.

58:37.458 --> 58:39.958
Please hurry.

58:53.083 --> 58:54.959
Hey, Garrett. How
are you holding up?

59:01.166 --> 59:03.416
Got some things
you need to sign.

59:03.417 --> 59:06.999
That's an evidence inventory
for your computers...

59:07.000 --> 59:08.874
and the damages waiver.

59:08.875 --> 59:10.457
You keep the pink one.

59:10.458 --> 59:15.207
And here is a list of places
that do crime scene clean up

59:15.208 --> 59:16.333
and some counseling.

59:17.375 --> 59:19.541
You should talk to someone...

59:19.542 --> 59:21.291
even if you think you're fine.

59:23.250 --> 59:24.458
I don't think I'm fine.

59:26.083 --> 59:29.082
Uh-huh. Good. Okay.

59:29.083 --> 59:31.749
Now you're sure
that nobody knows

59:31.750 --> 59:33.290
that you go to this place?

59:33.291 --> 59:35.124
I don't go there.

59:35.125 --> 59:37.165
It's, um... it's my
friend's uncle's place.

59:37.166 --> 59:38.416
We went there once to visit

59:38.417 --> 59:40.416
in the 10th grade
with their family.

59:40.417 --> 59:41.958
The road's barely on a map.

59:41.959 --> 59:43.834
It's out in the middle
of nowhere.

59:44.917 --> 59:47.333
He's... he's an artist.

59:48.500 --> 59:50.332
Alright, even still.

59:50.333 --> 59:52.040
Keep your head down.

59:52.041 --> 59:53.207
She won't last long.

59:53.208 --> 59:55.332
She messed up.
She has nowhere to go.

59:55.333 --> 59:58.499
We got a reward out, a tip line.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.833
And the media
cluster-fuck on this

01:00:00.834 --> 01:00:02.124
is actually gonna help.

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:04.624
We will find her.

01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:06.791
And we'll get you
your life back.

01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:08.000
Hmm?

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:12.375
Keep it.

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:30.333
Hey.

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:32.917
Hey.

01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:35.416
Are you sure about this?

01:00:35.417 --> 01:00:37.791
I... I can't go home.

01:00:37.792 --> 01:00:39.457
Come stay with us.

01:00:39.458 --> 01:00:41.165
Raylene won't mind.

01:00:41.166 --> 01:00:42.709
Puts you in danger.

01:00:54.542 --> 01:00:55.916
You know what I love about you?

01:00:55.917 --> 01:00:57.749
Don't fuck our shit up now.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.333
You haven't said,
"I told you so."

01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:02.750
No fun if I say it.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:07.207
Go.

01:01:29.709 --> 01:01:31.749
How much for a room?

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.417
Uh, $63.97.

01:01:35.417 --> 01:01:36.874
Um, can I see your license?

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:38.417
Oh.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:42.249
Oh my God, I left it in the car.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:43.582
Oh, no.

01:01:43.583 --> 01:01:45.374
Yeah.

01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:47.958
Can I show it to you later?

01:01:47.959 --> 01:01:49.749
Yeah, yeah. Sure. Sure.

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:50.750
Thank you.

01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:52.541
Yeah.
Thank you so much.

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:25.124
A national manhunt is underway

01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:28.624
prompted by the murder of a
police detective here in Fresno.

01:02:28.625 --> 01:02:30.791
It seems to have started
with viral videos,

01:02:30.792 --> 01:02:34.791
but has blown up into tragic,
real world consequences.

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:35.833
Detect...

01:04:04.083 --> 01:04:06.249
Okay, so...

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.374
no one knows we're here.

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:08.917
No one can hear us scream.

01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:12.750
Okay, great. Thank you.

01:04:23.959 --> 01:04:25.583
Oh. Yes.

01:04:26.667 --> 01:04:27.874
Security system.

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:02.291
Okay, go!

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:06.124
Yes!

01:05:08.417 --> 01:05:11.082
I mean it. I really can't
believe you're all out there

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:12.624
carrying my head
around in your pockets,

01:05:12.625 --> 01:05:14.541
and checking in
with my head in your desks.

01:05:14.542 --> 01:05:15.958
It's... it's crazy.

01:05:15.959 --> 01:05:17.290
But you have changed my life,

01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:18.959
and you have made
my dreams come true.

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:21.791
And I love you guys.

01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:24.999
I really do.
I really do.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.332
Like a lot.

01:05:56.834 --> 01:05:58.958
Hey, so Uncle Ray's
cable account.

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:00.666
It's his ISP.

01:06:00.667 --> 01:06:02.541
We don't have to log in
to anything.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.541
No one'll know it's us.

01:06:04.542 --> 01:06:07.791
We could just be on
the Internet as civilians.

01:06:07.792 --> 01:06:10.124
This isn't just about
hiding out, Lyle.

01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:12.999
You know, I...
I have to figure out who I am.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.582
Offline.

01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:17.541
Every day, every day,
this is all I've done.

01:06:17.542 --> 01:06:21.332
I just need some kind of time...

01:06:21.333 --> 01:06:22.750
to myself.

01:06:27.709 --> 01:06:29.041
Okay.

01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:33.499
If we're gonna do this
whole self-reflective,

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.791
cleansing sweat lodge thing...

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:39.750
there's something
I have not entirely told you.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:44.875
I went out with her.

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:48.083
With who?

01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:55.582
She called me,

01:06:55.583 --> 01:06:57.165
and, um...

01:06:57.166 --> 01:07:00.291
we got together.
I think.

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:02.666
It's all kind of fuzzy.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:04.250
There was a lot
of drinking involved.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:07.250
Oh.

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:11.709
Thing is, I think that's
how she got your keys.

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:16.124
Okay.

01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:17.583
That's not your fault.

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:20.416
No.

01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:21.917
No, it's not.

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:29.791
But I was jealous.

01:07:29.792 --> 01:07:31.541
Ever since we were
nine years old,

01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:32.959
we were a team.

01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:37.083
In it together,
and now we're not.

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:42.749
So what was I supposed to do?

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:43.791
Stop?

01:07:43.792 --> 01:07:45.125
No.

01:07:46.333 --> 01:07:48.124
No, it's all good.

01:07:48.125 --> 01:07:49.792
That's what I'm trying to say.

01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:55.125
I am so glad
I'm not you right now.

01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:07.040
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa.

01:08:12.625 --> 01:08:15.165
This is my
recipe for macaroni and cheese.

01:08:15.166 --> 01:08:17.165
You get the macaroni,
you cook the macaroni.

01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:19.457
You might think gravity's
just for the birds, Rocko,

01:08:19.457 --> 01:08:21.791
but it's the law, and it goes
the same for everybody.

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:23.457
Oh, yeah?
I'm gonna stick...

01:08:23.457 --> 01:08:26.374
Okay, I'm genuinely trying now.

01:08:26.375 --> 01:08:28.249
I'm actually putting
in some effort,

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:29.582
and I'm... oh! It's dead!

01:08:29.582 --> 01:08:31.582
I can grow out of it if I
want, but I probably won't,

01:08:31.582 --> 01:08:35.499
so this is my head...
currently.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.332
Zombie apocalypse, guys.
What would you do?

01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:39.707
What would you
do in a zombie apocalypse?

01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:41.667
Wait, but who's... ah! Who's winning?

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:46.499
Ah.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.207
Point. Looting.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:50.541
I... you know, zombies
start walking the Earth?

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:53.791
I'll be the first at the mall
with a sledgehammer.

01:08:53.792 --> 01:08:56.165
What are you gonna do
in the zombie apocalypse?

01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:59.040
Uncle Ray's.
Half a point.

01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:00.541
What?!
What? No!

01:09:00.542 --> 01:09:02.040
Really?
No, say it ain't so.

01:09:02.041 --> 01:09:03.666
Oh my God.
So, Kiki has this...

01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:06.207
This uncle lives up
in a cabin by...

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:07.416
Lake Frontier.

01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:08.624
Lake Frontier, yes.

01:09:08.625 --> 01:09:09.874
The guy was crazy.

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:11.165
No, he's an artist.

01:09:11.166 --> 01:09:12.374
He is a little weird.

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:13.874
Yeah, he's
completely off the grid.

01:09:13.875 --> 01:09:15.374
We had to, like,
take this unmarked road

01:09:15.375 --> 01:09:17.749
- past the fire... past the
fire county dump. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:20.249
Anyway, that's where I
would go for the zombie apocalypse.

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:21.999
Really? Yes.
Uncle Ray's.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.541
You know when you can't...

01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:30.000
That's where I would
go for the zombie apocalypse.

01:09:33.082 --> 01:09:34.749
Lives up in a cabin by...

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:35.832
Lake Frontier.

01:09:35.834 --> 01:09:37.082
Lake Frontier, yes.
Point.

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:44.582
We had to, like,
take this unmarked road

01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:47.082
past the fire... the fire county dump.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.290
So, I've been out here a week,

01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:49.791
and they still can't find her,

01:10:49.792 --> 01:10:53.874
so I gotta figure out what
I'm gonna do from now on.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.709
Cannot live without YouTube.

01:10:58.291 --> 01:10:59.333
Yeah, I can't.

01:11:00.375 --> 01:11:01.833
I can't.

01:11:01.834 --> 01:11:03.165
It was fine.

01:11:03.166 --> 01:11:05.207
I don't want to live
without YouTube.

01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:07.499
I don't think that
we're too... connected.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.165
I don't think that
we share too much.

01:11:09.166 --> 01:11:10.166
I think that this...

01:11:10.167 --> 01:11:11.582
This technology
we have in the world

01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:13.165
is bringing us
all closer together.

01:11:13.166 --> 01:11:16.374
And yeah, that's...
That's... it's dangerous,

01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:18.749
and it's a risk
to open yourself up,

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.958
and to trust. I get that.

01:11:20.959 --> 01:11:22.041
Um...

01:11:23.917 --> 01:11:26.207
I may never get
to go home again,

01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:29.249
I may never be able
to use my real name again

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.833
in the world,

01:11:30.834 --> 01:11:33.165
and my life could suck.

01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:36.290
As long as this is real,
what... what we're doing here,

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:38.332
as long as this is good,

01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:39.874
then I'm good.

01:11:39.875 --> 01:11:41.500
So if I have to choose...

01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:44.958
I choose to live online.

01:11:44.959 --> 01:11:47.708
Hoffman Heads, you may
never know where I am,

01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:49.374
you may not know who I am,

01:11:49.375 --> 01:11:50.916
but I'm still gonna be here,

01:11:50.917 --> 01:11:52.958
every day, with you.

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:54.708
So I'm gonna post this video,

01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:57.040
What the fuck, man?
Holy fuck!

01:11:57.041 --> 01:11:59.041
What are you doing?
Where did you go?

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:01.708
I was making a video.

01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:03.541
You... oh. Okay, great.

01:12:03.542 --> 01:12:05.207
I thought you died.

01:12:05.208 --> 01:12:07.290
I almost pissed my pants, man.

01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:09.040
That's disgusting.
Yeah.

01:12:09.041 --> 01:12:10.082
I need a beer.
Yeah, me too.

01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:14.124
And with that deeply
philosophical conclusion

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:16.749
to my meditation
on man and nature,

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:19.624
Headlights, it's alive!

01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:21.416
Yes!

01:12:21.417 --> 01:12:23.749
Neither sleet nor snow,
nor dark of night,

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:26.207
Hoffman's Head is broadcasting
to you guys

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:27.833
live from an
undisclosed location.

01:12:27.834 --> 01:12:30.124
Nothing stops the livestream!

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.916
Nothing!

01:12:31.917 --> 01:12:32.999
Yes!

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.082
Glad you're back, dude.
Oh! Yes!

01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:38.374
Where are you guys?
It looks kinda freaky.

01:12:38.375 --> 01:12:40.082
Dude, did you just
seriously just ask me

01:12:40.083 --> 01:12:42.708
to disclose
the undisclosed location?

01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:44.290
And I almost did it as well,

01:12:44.291 --> 01:12:46.207
like a knee-jerk reaction.

01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:47.624
Are you guys okay?

01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:49.290
We heard FanGirl killed a cop.

01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:50.582
I bet it's a scam.

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:51.791
It was on the news.

01:12:51.792 --> 01:12:53.457
He's gonna end up
just like LonelyGirl.

01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:55.708
What, are you... you trying
to get more views, Hoffman?

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:58.749
Um, a good man lost his life

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.082
trying to protect and serve,

01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:01.332
and when...

01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:03.165
I know how to process that

01:13:03.166 --> 01:13:04.332
the right way...

01:13:04.333 --> 01:13:06.499
we can talk about it, okay?

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.917
We love you, Garrett.

01:13:09.625 --> 01:13:10.999
You know,
let's just try and have

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.207
some really stupid fun
tonight, yes?

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:15.082
Let's blow some shit up.
Okay.

01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:16.541
Let's blow some shit up.

01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:20.958
Can't stay covered like that.

01:13:20.959 --> 01:13:22.165
10-9, 40.

01:13:22.166 --> 01:13:25.207
We got a... got a clear path
to the blow-up zone.

01:13:25.208 --> 01:13:26.666
Clear path to the blow-up zone.

01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:28.207
Okay, clear a path.
Alright, little girl.

01:13:28.208 --> 01:13:30.457
Three, two, one.

01:13:47.375 --> 01:13:48.499
Hey, Garrett.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.791
Have you seen this?

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:51.999
Holy shit.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.375
FanGirl uploaded a new video.

01:14:06.166 --> 01:14:07.709
Garrett...

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:11.166
I think I know where you are.

01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:14.291
But...

01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:16.874
I don't think
we'll get to talk much

01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:18.959
when we see each other again.

01:14:20.625 --> 01:14:22.749
So I'm saying this here,

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.041
because I want you
to understand.

01:14:26.375 --> 01:14:28.500
My life is over.

01:14:30.208 --> 01:14:32.667
And I'm...
I'm so ready.

01:14:34.125 --> 01:14:36.375
But I keep thinking about you...

01:14:37.458 --> 01:14:38.583
forgetting me...

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:44.000
and that makes me
unbearably lonely.

01:14:48.542 --> 01:14:50.000
So...

01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:54.041
If we can't be united in life...

01:14:56.542 --> 01:14:58.542
we will be united in death.

01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:08.125
No way.

01:15:10.583 --> 01:15:12.082
Be right back.

01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:14.833
- What was that?
- What's going on?

01:15:14.834 --> 01:15:16.666
It's nothing. There's
nothing out there.

01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:19.791
It's the... it's the woods. It's the wind.
Garrett, it's probably...

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.416
It's squirrels in the wind.

01:15:24.417 --> 01:15:26.082
The fuck's going on here?

01:15:26.083 --> 01:15:27.249
Nothing.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:29.999
Garrett just thought he heard
something out there,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.416
but there's nothing out there.

01:15:31.417 --> 01:15:33.249
I'm pretty sure,
but not exactly sure.

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:34.749
- You guys okay?
- We're good.

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:36.583
We're safe. You see anything?
I bet you don't.

01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:42.749
Fuck. She's out there.

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:44.582
What?
She's out there.

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:46.249
Oh, God. Mom, I love you.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.917
If you're watching,
I love you so much.

01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:54.082
Everybody, listen.
FanGirl is here.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.708
We need you guys to call 911.

01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:57.124
We don't have any service.

01:15:57.125 --> 01:15:59.457
Lyle, where are we? Lyle:
County access road just outside

01:15:59.458 --> 01:16:01.207
Country access road...

01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:03.083
outside of Lake Frontier.
Off the 168.

01:16:08.792 --> 01:16:10.082
Off 168.

01:16:10.083 --> 01:16:11.923
You gotta go past the
quarry and then the dump.

01:16:13.959 --> 01:16:15.499
Off the 168. Past the
quarry and the dump,

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.624
off the 168, alright?

01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:17.833
There's no fucking address,

01:16:17.834 --> 01:16:19.291
because Uncle Ray is a fucknut!

01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:24.958
This is fucking hysterical.

01:16:24.959 --> 01:16:28.666
Is this some horror sketch livestream?

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:29.875
We're in actual danger!

01:16:35.667 --> 01:16:37.166
Oh, fuck.

01:16:40.667 --> 01:16:42.124
What the...?

01:16:42.125 --> 01:16:43.375
Hello?

01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:58.124
Oh, fuck. We're fucked.

01:16:58.125 --> 01:16:59.582
Fuck. Shit. Fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:02.333
Goddamn son
of a bitch, fucking...

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.999
Oh, fuck. Goddammit.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.207
Fuck.

01:17:06.208 --> 01:17:07.624
Shit.

01:17:07.625 --> 01:17:10.041
Ow. Fuck.

01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:17.375
Shit. Motherfucker.

01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:25.875
Garrett?

01:17:27.208 --> 01:17:30.082
Garrett. Shh. Come
here for a second.

01:17:30.083 --> 01:17:31.624
Don't fucking do that.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:33.583
Shh, then don't fucking yell.

01:17:42.583 --> 01:17:43.875
This is insane.

01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:46.750
We should make
a run for the car.

01:17:48.041 --> 01:17:49.207
No.

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:50.374
No, you don't leave the castle.

01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:52.040
You stay inside the walls.

01:17:52.041 --> 01:17:54.040
What fucking castle?

01:17:54.041 --> 01:17:56.457
If we go outside,

01:17:56.458 --> 01:17:57.959
she's gonna kill us.

01:17:59.417 --> 01:18:01.582
If she has to come in here,

01:18:01.583 --> 01:18:02.875
we kill her.

01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:10.749
I have a plan.

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:12.290
It's a little outside the box,

01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:15.958
but what if you stay here

01:18:15.959 --> 01:18:17.666
and... and...

01:18:17.667 --> 01:18:20.207
And make her think
that she's got us trapped?

01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:22.792
I'll slip out, and, uh...
And I'll go for help.

01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:27.125
Your plan is to leave
me here and run away?

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.625
But she's not in love with me.

01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:07.291
Son of a bitch. Okay.

01:19:39.083 --> 01:19:41.291
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:00.417
Shit.

01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:31.290
Shell!

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:36.834
Why couldn't you just love me?

01:22:37.792 --> 01:22:39.709
Why couldn't you just let me go?

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:50.375
That's not love.

01:24:39.917 --> 01:24:41.083
Hello?

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.709
Hello?

01:24:58.834 --> 01:25:00.749
Oh my God.

01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:03.291
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
I've been driving all night.

01:25:04.834 --> 01:25:06.666
It's me. It's Petunia.

01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:07.958
Petunia4ever.

01:25:07.959 --> 01:25:09.166
Can you move? Are...

01:25:10.333 --> 01:25:12.374
We have to get you...
We have to get you out of here.

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:13.582
Come on, okay?

01:25:13.583 --> 01:25:15.708
You just...
Alright. We're gonna go.

01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:16.833
It's okay.

01:25:16.834 --> 01:25:18.208
It's okay.

01:25:19.583 --> 01:25:21.792
Okay. Come on.

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:39.999
Keep talking to me, okay?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.040
Um, just don't... don't, like,
go into the light or anything.

01:25:43.041 --> 01:25:44.082
Okay?

01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:46.040
Alright? We'll just talk.

01:25:46.041 --> 01:25:47.791
Um, I'm gonna take care of you.

01:25:47.792 --> 01:25:49.374
I'm gonna get you some fluids,

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:51.582
some, like, electrolytes.

01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:54.208
Just as soon as I
get you home safe.

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:58.166
Hospital.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.416
I once took care
of a dog with a broken leg,

01:26:02.417 --> 01:26:04.332
and I...

01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:06.874
I rescued it, and I found
all these videos on YouTube

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:09.874
about how to take care
of a dog with a broken leg.

01:26:09.875 --> 01:26:10.999
And I did it,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.582
and... and it lived with me,

01:26:12.583 --> 01:26:15.290
and I... I took care of it
for six months.

01:26:25.375 --> 01:26:28.582
I can't believe
you're here, Garrett,

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.416
in my car with me.

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:32.708
Oh, I wanna show you
some of my drawings.

01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:35.125
I think you're gonna...
Really gonna like them.

01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:41.542
I am gonna take
such good care of you.
