00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
What's up, meat bots?

00:16.047 --> 00:18.319
Excuse me.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.792
What do you think
you're doing?

00:21.792 --> 00:23.094
This is the fourth time
this week I've caught you

00:23.094 --> 00:24.825
blowing off
your security rounds.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.127
What do you expect?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.798
This job is too hard
for one person.

00:27.798 --> 00:29.730
How am I supposed
to patrol the grounds,

00:29.730 --> 00:32.662
monitor cyber security,
and still find time

00:32.662 --> 00:34.665
to steal from you?

00:34.665 --> 00:36.137
Look, you asked me
for this job.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.838
If you can't handle it,

00:37.838 --> 00:39.810
maybe I should find
somebody else.

00:39.810 --> 00:41.872
Good luck trying
to find someone else

00:41.872 --> 00:44.545
who wants a high-paying job
on a tropical island.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.520
Hey, what's going on
with the monitors?

00:49.520 --> 00:51.122
Somebody probably
hacked our signal

00:51.122 --> 00:53.554
because the sheriff
wasn't doing her job.

00:55.226 --> 00:56.827
Hi!

00:56.827 --> 00:58.489
( all screaming )

00:58.489 --> 01:01.362
I've been trying
to get in here for months.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.094
I had to go through
 all sorts of firewalls

01:03.094 --> 01:04.864
and security blocks.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.567
If I didn't
 know any better,

01:06.567 --> 01:08.439
I'd think you didn't
 want me here.

01:08.439 --> 01:10.941
We don't want you here.

01:10.941 --> 01:13.944
Well, look who finally got
 a big-boy voice.

01:13.944 --> 01:16.777
Still waiting for the rest
 of your little-boy body

01:16.777 --> 01:18.149
to catch up, huh?

01:19.810 --> 01:22.983
Eddy, you're supposed to be
in Mission Creek with Tasha.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.116
Don't worry,
 she's fine.

01:25.116 --> 01:27.388
I triple-locked her
 in the closet.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.820
Even her man paws
 can't claw through that.

01:31.522 --> 01:34.865
Speaking of man paws,
 how are you, Bree?

01:34.865 --> 01:37.768
That's it.
Where's the hammer?

01:37.768 --> 01:39.730
I don't know
 about the hammer,

01:39.730 --> 01:43.534
but I'm definitely looking at
 a room full of tools.

01:45.776 --> 01:48.139
The world's first
 bionic superhumans.

01:48.139 --> 01:49.780
They're stronger than us.

01:49.780 --> 01:52.413
Faster.
 Smarter.

01:52.413 --> 01:55.186
The next generation of
 the human race is...

01:55.186 --> 01:57.148
living on
a bionic island.

02:33.884 --> 02:36.687
Hey, great news,
everybody.

02:36.687 --> 02:38.789
You scored a goal in
your junior soccer league?

02:38.789 --> 02:40.231
You finally fit into
men's pants?

02:40.231 --> 02:41.962
You're going bald?

02:41.962 --> 02:44.795
Why would that be
great news?

02:44.795 --> 02:47.037
You already act like
a boring old man.

02:47.037 --> 02:49.440
Might as well
look the part.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.842
The president wants me
to be on

02:51.842 --> 02:53.944
his environmental
task force committee.

02:53.944 --> 02:56.747
It's a think tank of
the world's smartest minds

02:56.747 --> 02:59.380
brought together to address
major ecological issues.

02:59.380 --> 03:03.053
Sounds like something
a boring old man would say.

03:03.053 --> 03:06.757
This is the biggest thing
that's ever happened to me.

03:06.757 --> 03:09.520
Committee member today,
president tomorrow.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.323
And revolution
the day after.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.165
What about
your responsibilities here?

03:15.165 --> 03:16.997
Yeah, without you,
who's gonna bore

03:16.997 --> 03:18.369
all the students
to death?

03:18.369 --> 03:22.273
I already told Chase
I would cover all his classes.

03:22.273 --> 03:24.705
Problem solved.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.277
The president
is coming here

03:26.277 --> 03:29.079
to interview me
and give his official
stamp of approval.

03:29.079 --> 03:31.942
Then it's off to
Washington, D.C.,
for good.

03:31.942 --> 03:33.914
Congratulations.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.886
We'll really miss you.

03:35.886 --> 03:38.519
I call dibs on
his capsule.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.922
Washington, D.C.?

03:41.922 --> 03:44.094
That's like another country.

03:44.094 --> 03:46.927
This isn't fair.
Why does Chase get
to leave and we don't?

03:46.927 --> 03:48.929
Well, for starters,

03:48.929 --> 03:51.302
because Chase knows
that Washington, D.C.

03:51.302 --> 03:53.904
isn't a country.

03:58.068 --> 04:00.971
Perry, can I talk
to you for a second?

04:00.971 --> 04:02.973
Sure thing, boss man.

04:02.973 --> 04:05.276
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

04:05.276 --> 04:07.147
I thought about what you
said about being overworked,

04:07.147 --> 04:10.150
and I may have been
a little harsh.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.582
So you're giving
me a raise?

04:11.582 --> 04:14.254
I said I'm sorry,
not crazy.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.488
What I'm gonna give you
is better than a raise.

04:17.488 --> 04:21.031
Say hello to
your new partner.

04:23.594 --> 04:27.197
- Him?
- Does this guy even know
anything about bionics?

04:27.197 --> 04:29.199
Actually, he knows
a lot more about bionics

04:29.199 --> 04:31.942
than you might think.
Isn't that right?

04:31.942 --> 04:33.103
That's ri-i-ight!

04:33.103 --> 04:35.576
( all screaming )

04:35.576 --> 04:36.977
Eddy?

04:39.380 --> 04:42.653
That's the little guy
in the wall?

04:42.653 --> 04:45.055
In the flesh.
Check me out.

04:51.191 --> 04:56.096
Why would you give a body
to the most vile computer
program ever created?

04:56.096 --> 04:58.168
Don't worry.

04:58.168 --> 04:59.970
Human Eddy isn't mean.

04:59.970 --> 05:01.802
When I put his artificial
intelligence

05:01.802 --> 05:03.203
into this
synthetic body,

05:03.203 --> 05:05.035
I altered
his personality.

05:05.035 --> 05:06.877
I made him nice.

05:06.877 --> 05:10.080
I begged him not to,
but now I'm glad.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.113
One little fix,
and you expect us

05:13.113 --> 05:15.115
to believe that
Eddy is nice?

05:15.115 --> 05:16.246
I'm not buying it.

05:16.246 --> 05:17.948
No, it's true.

05:17.948 --> 05:20.090
Earlier today, I caught
Leo struggling to do a push-up.

05:20.090 --> 05:21.952
The old me
would've mocked him.

05:21.952 --> 05:24.094
But the new me
is just sad.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.258
Poor Leo.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.132
I guess that's better.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.866
Long story short,
I still wanna kill you guys.

05:35.866 --> 05:38.669
With kindness.

05:38.669 --> 05:40.641
I don't get it.

05:40.641 --> 05:43.243
You could've designed
any kind of body for him.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.075
Why does he
look like that?

05:45.075 --> 05:47.077
The beard hides
my gear.

05:47.077 --> 05:48.278
You wanna see?

05:53.083 --> 05:54.655
Yeah, besides,
I couldn't make somebody

05:54.655 --> 05:56.056
better looking
than me.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.058
I literally
could not.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.930
This is
once-in-a-lifetime stuff.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.734
That's my Donny.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.569
All right,
Mr. President.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.141
I'm all packed
and ready to go.

06:11.141 --> 06:13.774
Where will I be staying?
West wing, east wing?

06:13.774 --> 06:16.106
Pull-out sofa bed
in the Oval Office?

06:16.106 --> 06:17.778
Hold on now.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.010
I can't just
give you the job.

06:20.010 --> 06:22.152
I meant it when I said
there was an interview first.

06:22.152 --> 06:24.114
Oh, yeah,
of course you did.

06:24.114 --> 06:26.687
This one,
so by the book.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.619
All right,
I'll play along.

06:28.619 --> 06:31.291
Go ahead,
interview me.

06:33.163 --> 06:35.626
Why don't you just
tell the committee

06:35.626 --> 06:36.897
a little about yourself?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.499
Well, for starters,

06:38.499 --> 06:40.370
I have so many
scientific accomplishments,

06:40.370 --> 06:42.673
It would take me hours
to list them all.

06:42.673 --> 06:45.105
- That won't be necessary.
- So glad you asked.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.377
First up, perfecting
cold fusion.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.312
Then, I memorized
the first ten billion
digits of pi,

06:52.312 --> 06:58.118
which are
3.14159265358979323846

06:58.118 --> 07:05.255
21101100449293215160842444
859637669--

07:05.255 --> 07:07.127
2480615--

07:07.127 --> 07:10.601
I love the environment,
but this may not be worth it.

07:15.165 --> 07:17.307
Well, you've seen
the whole joint.

07:17.307 --> 07:19.169
Tell me that doesn't
fill up your hate bucket.

07:19.169 --> 07:22.573
I'll tell you what's
wrong with these kids, Terry.

07:22.573 --> 07:24.174
There's not enough of 'em.

07:24.174 --> 07:26.346
You're new here,

07:26.346 --> 07:28.178
so I'm gonna
let that one go.

07:28.178 --> 07:31.281
Come on. We've got
work to do.

07:31.281 --> 07:33.383
Let's blow it off
and go eat subs on the beach.

07:33.383 --> 07:35.956
Now, Terry,
we're model employees.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.858
We can't slack off
like that.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.861
Plus, I thought we agreed we're
gonna cut back on the carbs.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.763
That's it.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.765
If we're gonna be partners,
I want the old Eddy back.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.997
Donny said he programmed you
to act this way.

07:46.997 --> 07:49.970
That means there's gotta be
a way to reprogram you.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.542
Oh, yeah, that's easy,

07:51.542 --> 07:53.173
but we need Donny's
password to do it.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.576
Oh, I have
all his passwords.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.347
Plus his credit cards,
his thumbprint,

07:57.347 --> 08:00.250
and his original nose.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.252
Let's do it.

08:02.252 --> 08:04.284
My lips are sealed.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.356
Except for a smile.

08:07.758 --> 08:09.920
Did it work?

08:09.920 --> 08:12.523
Better than your last
trip to the beauty parlor.

08:12.523 --> 08:13.964
You're back!

08:13.964 --> 08:16.296
Now remember,
this is our little secret.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.368
You can't tell Donny
what I did to you.

08:18.368 --> 08:19.830
And you can't go out
in public

08:19.830 --> 08:21.401
without a mask
on your face.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.042
Good morning, Eddy.

08:32.042 --> 08:33.513
Go choke on a muffin.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.288
What did he
just say?

08:38.288 --> 08:41.251
I said go choke
on a muffin.

08:41.251 --> 08:42.953
But if you prefer
a bagel or Danish,

08:42.953 --> 08:45.255
as long as you're
gasping for air, I'm good.

08:46.957 --> 08:49.930
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.502
I'm back.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.406
Remember all those times
you treated me like

08:56.406 --> 08:58.869
a piece of junk
on the wall?

08:58.869 --> 09:02.212
Well, guess what.
It's your turn.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.977
Don't get too excited.

09:06.977 --> 09:08.979
You'll use up
all your air faster.

09:16.386 --> 09:18.989
Then I converted every recorded
presidential address

09:18.989 --> 09:21.161
from analog to digital.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.763
Isn't that fun?

09:24.034 --> 09:26.566
( loud crashing )

09:26.566 --> 09:28.038
Adam!

09:29.139 --> 09:30.370
What are you doing?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.102
Oh, my, I'm so sorry.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.474
Is this where you're having
your little interview?

09:34.474 --> 09:36.176
What a coincidence.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.908
It's also where I practice
playing my...

09:39.149 --> 09:41.311
big, loud, shiny things.

09:44.354 --> 09:46.356
Get out.

09:48.819 --> 09:51.021
Does anyone else wanna
sneak out the back

09:51.021 --> 09:54.324
and pretend all this
never happened?

09:54.324 --> 09:56.526
Sorry about that.
He's just jealous

09:56.526 --> 09:58.929
because I'm going to
Washington and he's not.

09:58.929 --> 10:00.771
Now, where were we?

10:00.771 --> 10:02.903
Pizza's here!

10:02.903 --> 10:06.536
Adam, I'm in the middle
of my presentation.

10:06.536 --> 10:10.410
Middle?
Adam, sit down.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.883
Don't mind if I do.

10:12.883 --> 10:14.344
What are you guys
talking about?

10:14.344 --> 10:17.547
Well, I'd like to be
talking about global warming.

10:17.547 --> 10:20.691
I don't suppose you have
any thoughts?

10:20.691 --> 10:22.492
Let's see.

10:22.492 --> 10:24.554
The globe is
warm and round,

10:24.554 --> 10:26.326
much like my pizza.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.558
And when I cool it,
I only blow on the parts

10:28.558 --> 10:30.560
I'm about to take
a bite of.

10:31.902 --> 10:34.705
So what I think
you're saying is,

10:34.705 --> 10:37.537
instead of focusing on
the entire planet,

10:37.537 --> 10:41.241
we zero in on
the specific hot spots, right?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.143
Uh, yeah.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.845
You know what?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.447
You may be
on to something.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.519
Maybe I underestimated
you, Adam.

10:50.821 --> 10:53.523
Well, perhaps we'll find
more answers

10:53.523 --> 10:54.885
with a simpler approach.

10:54.885 --> 10:56.386
What?

10:56.386 --> 10:58.528
I think we have
another candidate

10:58.528 --> 11:00.060
for the job.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.793
Him? No!

11:02.793 --> 11:05.095
Hear that, Chase?

11:05.095 --> 11:06.997
I'm gonna be president.

11:14.544 --> 11:16.206
What do you think
you're doing?

11:16.206 --> 11:17.978
That job was mine.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.851
Chase, I can't help it
if I'm a genius.

11:20.851 --> 11:22.783
You are not a genius.

11:22.783 --> 11:26.256
The president thinks so,
and he's a pretty smart dude.

11:26.256 --> 11:27.958
There's a reason that
he's the king of America.

11:31.561 --> 11:34.765
Okay, here's how
we'll decide who's
the best candidate.

11:34.765 --> 11:36.266
We'll have a debate.

11:36.266 --> 11:37.697
Whoever wins
gets the job. Fair?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.099
Sounds good to me.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.500
Let's debate.
I call skins.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.805
Uh, this is gonna
get ugly really fast.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.337
So you're gonna
be skins?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.543
First question.

11:53.543 --> 11:57.347
Chase, what would you do
to reduce greenhouse gases?

11:57.347 --> 11:59.189
Easy.

11:59.189 --> 12:02.492
Curtail our rampant
consumption of fossil fuels,

12:02.492 --> 12:04.454
then overhaul
our infrastructure,

12:04.454 --> 12:06.526
and switch to
renewable energy sources.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.528
Adam, you're up.

12:08.528 --> 12:12.502
The planet of the earth

12:12.502 --> 12:15.435
and the fuels of fossil
contain force

12:15.435 --> 12:20.410
that is clearly curtain
energy from shoes,

12:20.410 --> 12:24.414
lightning cans,
ozone climate candles.

12:24.414 --> 12:26.476
Yes.

12:29.019 --> 12:30.650
Okay, this debate
is over.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.322
Whoo! Did I win?

12:32.322 --> 12:36.686
Ha ha. Let me put it
into terms you can understand.

12:36.686 --> 12:39.659
You see this pizza?
This is you.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.491
This is me.

12:45.035 --> 12:48.238
Ha! I just ate you up.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.404
You know, I don't think

12:54.404 --> 12:57.407
I've ever had anyone
offer to brush my hair before.

12:57.407 --> 12:59.349
Welcome to heaven.

13:02.652 --> 13:04.184
Oh, goodness.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.186
Look at these two
messy Bessies.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.519
Hope those aren't
school clothes, Donald.

13:09.519 --> 13:12.692
You know exactly
what happened.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.895
Eddy disabled our bionics
with his laser cuffs.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.726
Then he cut open the wall,
shoved us in,

13:16.726 --> 13:18.198
and sealed it back up.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.499
I don't believe that.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.731
I programmed him
to be nice now.

13:21.731 --> 13:24.504
Really? Wanna check
the security camera footage?

13:30.680 --> 13:32.042
I don't get it.

13:32.042 --> 13:34.144
The wall's intact.

13:34.144 --> 13:35.685
But it was just...

13:35.685 --> 13:37.187
It was just what, honey?

13:37.187 --> 13:40.390
Be a big girl
and use your words.

13:40.390 --> 13:42.993
- He doctored the footage.
- Come on, guys.

13:42.993 --> 13:45.095
Why are you trying
to get Eddy in trouble?

13:45.095 --> 13:46.626
He hasn't done anything.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.629
It's obviously a desperate
cry for attention.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.402
It's okay, there's enough
of Daddy's love

13:52.402 --> 13:54.504
for all of us.

13:55.565 --> 13:58.608
It's only his second
day as a human.

13:58.608 --> 14:00.510
He deserves better.

14:00.510 --> 14:02.873
We both
deserve better.

14:02.873 --> 14:04.614
You're buying this?

14:04.614 --> 14:08.078
If you're asking if
I believe in my technology

14:08.078 --> 14:11.481
more than my children,
yes.

14:14.624 --> 14:16.426
Congratulations, Chase.

14:16.426 --> 14:18.188
You're clearly the most
qualified candidate,

14:18.188 --> 14:21.631
and since I don't have to
attend any future meetings,

14:21.631 --> 14:22.792
welcome aboard.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.965
Thank you, sir.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.036
Oh, and Adam.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.699
Thank you for
the pizza.

14:31.341 --> 14:33.803
No problem.
Give my best to the queen.

14:42.983 --> 14:46.156
Did you really think
that you could steal
that job away from me?

14:46.156 --> 14:49.119
Nope.
I just didn't want
you to get it.

14:49.119 --> 14:50.660
Yeah, 'cause
you're jealous.

14:50.660 --> 14:51.992
- Nah.
- Yes, you are.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.364
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
Look at you.

14:54.364 --> 14:55.966
You're so jealous,
and you can't even admit it.

14:55.966 --> 14:57.797
Okay, you wanna know
the real reason

14:57.797 --> 14:58.969
why I didn't want
you to get the job?

14:58.969 --> 15:00.570
Go ahead. This should
be real good.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.602
'Cause I didn't want
you to leave.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.307
Wait. That's what
this is all about?

15:07.307 --> 15:09.279
Yeah.

15:09.279 --> 15:11.041
But you know what?

15:11.041 --> 15:13.143
Doesn't matter anymore.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.846
Good luck, Chase.

15:22.492 --> 15:25.325
Okay. If Eddy's
gonna play dirty,

15:25.325 --> 15:27.357
so are we.

15:27.357 --> 15:29.099
( chortling )

15:29.099 --> 15:31.031
So...

15:31.031 --> 15:33.863
seems like things have
been running pretty smoothly

15:33.863 --> 15:35.735
with Eddy here, huh?

15:35.735 --> 15:38.608
Yeah. With him on the job,
I got to spend the morning

15:38.608 --> 15:40.810
spear fishing with
my big toe nail.

15:40.810 --> 15:43.043
So I guess it won't be
too long before

15:43.043 --> 15:46.816
Mr. Davenport notices
how well Eddy's doing.

15:46.816 --> 15:48.448
And I do recall
him saying

15:48.448 --> 15:50.450
that if you
couldn't do the job,

15:50.450 --> 15:52.652
he'd replace you with
someone who can.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.324
Donny would never fire me.

15:54.324 --> 15:56.186
He loves me.

15:56.186 --> 15:59.029
He yells at you
all the time and
calls you horrible names.

15:59.029 --> 16:02.292
That's what people who
love each other do.

16:02.292 --> 16:04.734
Come to think of it,

16:04.734 --> 16:07.637
Eddy is off doing
your job as we speak.

16:07.637 --> 16:10.840
And if there's
no job for you...

16:13.973 --> 16:15.475
You're right, Dooley.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.747
That dashing robo-hippie
is trying to snake my gig.

16:17.747 --> 16:20.080
I gotta go sharpen
my big toe and go get him.

16:28.818 --> 16:31.091
What are you doing?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.922
Since you're leaving,
I'm using your capsule

16:32.922 --> 16:34.824
as my sock drawer.

16:34.824 --> 16:37.127
Well, you can stop.

16:37.127 --> 16:38.328
No, I can't.

16:38.328 --> 16:39.799
I already broke up
with my old sock drawer.

16:39.799 --> 16:43.203
If I go back now,
it's just gonna be awkward.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.306
No, I mean, you can stop,

16:46.306 --> 16:47.877
because I already
called the president,

16:47.877 --> 16:50.110
and told him I'm not
gonna take the job.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.842
Why?

16:52.842 --> 16:56.046
Look, I thought you were
sabotaging me,

16:56.046 --> 16:57.947
so I acted like a jerk.

16:57.947 --> 17:00.550
But when you admitted that
you just didn't want me to go,

17:00.550 --> 17:03.393
I felt terrible.

17:03.393 --> 17:07.196
Oh. Well, nothing makes me
feel happier

17:07.196 --> 17:09.329
than knowing
you feel terrible.

17:10.859 --> 17:13.762
But you're really
gonna stay?

17:13.762 --> 17:16.205
Yeah. The more
I thought about it,

17:16.205 --> 17:18.407
why would I go to
Washington, D.C.?

17:18.407 --> 17:20.910
I already have
my dream job right here.

17:20.910 --> 17:23.772
As long as
you're staying,
so do I.

17:23.772 --> 17:25.474
What's that?

17:25.474 --> 17:27.046
Throwing you.

17:33.383 --> 17:34.884
Hey, Sasquatch.

17:34.884 --> 17:36.856
- Oh, hey, Ter.
- Don't you "Hey, Ter" me.

17:36.856 --> 17:40.660
I know what you're up to,
and there's no way
you're stealing my job.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.663
Oh, Terry, I could never
fill your shoes.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.266
Mostly because I don't fit
into a size gnome.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.838
What did you say to me?

17:48.838 --> 17:50.940
I said why don't you go
back to your mushroom house

17:50.940 --> 17:52.342
and leave me alone?

17:52.342 --> 17:54.374
Okay, that's it.
There's only room

17:54.374 --> 17:56.746
for one of us
at this academy.

17:56.746 --> 17:58.178
Yeah, I'll say,

17:58.178 --> 18:00.049
so why don't you
squeeze over

18:00.049 --> 18:02.882
- and give me some space?
- You're goin' down!

18:10.059 --> 18:13.263
Ha ha! My body's synthetic,
so I don't feel pain.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.965
- You can't hurt me!
- Yes, I can.

18:19.969 --> 18:21.931
Hey, if you're gonna
grab my beard,

18:21.931 --> 18:23.573
then I'm gonna
grab yours.

18:28.938 --> 18:30.710
Guys, what's
going on?

18:30.710 --> 18:33.012
Eddy's bad again,
and Perry's trying
to destroy him.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.984
Tell her to
watch the beard.

18:34.984 --> 18:36.886
My phone's
charging in there.

18:36.886 --> 18:39.849
( panting )

18:39.849 --> 18:42.222
Used all my signature
moves on him and
nothing worked.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.893
Even the Perry throttle.

18:43.893 --> 18:48.458
Hey, get back here and fight me
like the she-beast you are.

18:48.458 --> 18:52.031
Oh, I will,
you deranged drifter.

18:52.031 --> 18:55.935
Since you reprogrammed me
to be mean again,

18:55.935 --> 18:57.307
I'm unstoppable.

18:57.307 --> 19:00.009
( derisive laughter )

19:00.009 --> 19:02.572
You reprogrammed him?

19:02.572 --> 19:04.574
Not now, kids.
I'm a little busy.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.049
Oh, Perry's gettin'
her butt kicked.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.751
If we don't take
Eddy out,

19:11.751 --> 19:13.152
he's gonna terrorize
this place forever.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.386
Not if my bionic leg
has anything to say about it.

19:16.386 --> 19:19.359
That doesn't sound
as macho as you think.

19:22.932 --> 19:24.834
Release the beast, Eddy.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.666
Sit tight, Leo.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.398
You're next.

19:28.398 --> 19:30.840
No, you are.

19:35.745 --> 19:36.906
Didn't feel a thing.

19:36.906 --> 19:39.379
Who else wants to
not hurt me?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.180
That's it.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.912
I'm going to get
Mr. Davenport.

19:42.912 --> 19:46.416
Go ahead. I have him
totally fooled.

19:46.416 --> 19:51.120
That has-been has no idea
I'm back to my old self.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.922
Yes, I do.

19:52.922 --> 19:54.794
Ha ha, Donny.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.697
Hi!

19:57.697 --> 20:00.129
You beard-dialed me
on Adam's phone.

20:00.129 --> 20:01.801
Heard everything.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.903
Everything?

20:03.903 --> 20:06.236
It was just a show
for the kids.

20:06.236 --> 20:08.177
I'm bad, I'm good,
I'm bad, I'm good.

20:08.177 --> 20:10.179
I'm just a great big
bag of emotions.

20:10.179 --> 20:13.112
( fake crying and laughing )

20:14.784 --> 20:16.546
It's over, Eddy.
It's time for you to go

20:16.546 --> 20:18.087
back in the wall
where you belong.

20:18.087 --> 20:20.089
No, please.
I'll be good.

20:20.089 --> 20:21.651
Or how about
just not bad

20:21.651 --> 20:22.952
in front of you,
split the difference?

20:22.952 --> 20:24.954
What do you say,
Don-Don, huh?

20:28.097 --> 20:30.860
Don't make me
hurt you, Donny.

20:30.860 --> 20:32.362
I don't wanna
hurt you.

20:32.362 --> 20:35.865
You already hurt me
with your words.

20:35.865 --> 20:39.138
Okay, I can't stomach
much more of this.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.914
Oh, Donny,
I'm so sorry.

20:44.914 --> 20:46.546
I didn't mean it.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.748
I didn't mean it!

20:52.121 --> 20:53.823
Bet he felt that.

21:01.831 --> 21:04.233
Well, Eddy, you're finally
back where you belong.

21:04.233 --> 21:08.097
Yeah, well, at least
 you let me keep the beard.

21:08.097 --> 21:10.640
But I got to
keep your hand.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.742
If you knew where
 that's been,

21:12.742 --> 21:14.574
you wouldn't be
 holding it.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.450
Hey, who tore me apart
 anyway?

21:20.450 --> 21:22.151
Your new wall mate.

21:22.151 --> 21:23.983
Wall mate?

21:23.983 --> 21:27.016
Let me out!
 Get me outta here!

21:27.016 --> 21:29.088
Oh, no,
 I got an itch.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.960
Scratch it, Eddy,
 scratch it.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.993
No. No!
 Get me outta here!

21:33.993 --> 21:36.295
Get me outta here!
