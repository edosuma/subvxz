00:03.959 --> 00:07.333
Honey, you are going to love
my Halloween costume this year.

00:07.417 --> 00:09.959
But not as much
as you are gonna love mine.

00:10.041 --> 00:12.500
No, you're gonna love mine more.

00:12.583 --> 00:14.667
- No, you're gonna love mine more--
- Guys!

00:15.709 --> 00:17.917
Save the creepiness for tonight.

00:20.583 --> 00:23.083
By the way, I can't take Charlie
trick-or-treating this year.

00:23.333 --> 00:26.291
I've got plans.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.375
Ivy and I can take her.

00:29.458 --> 00:31.250
We're going to a party,
but that's not until later.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.917
You wanna know what my plans are?

00:36.417 --> 00:37.750
Okay, you forced it out of me.

00:39.458 --> 00:40.750
I am going out...

00:41.667 --> 00:42.667
with a girl.

00:43.750 --> 00:45.834
So is Emmett going as Beyonce again?

00:46.834 --> 00:49.875
Her name is Zoey,
and I met her while delivering chicken--

00:50.917 --> 00:53.709
Two piece, dark meat, gravy on the side.

00:55.709 --> 00:57.792
- Wow, she sounds great.
- I know.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.000
She's a lot of fun. You're gonna love her.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.125
Love her already.

01:02.208 --> 01:04.083
Stop that.

01:04.166 --> 01:05.959
Well, I for one am glad to hear

01:06.041 --> 01:08.709
that PJ Has gotten over Skyler
and has found a new girl.

01:09.041 --> 01:11.834
Hey, so long as I don't have to look
at Beyonce Emmett, I'm happy.

- Happy Halloween, Mrs. Dabney.
- What do you want?

02:18.375 --> 02:20.959
I see you put on the witch costume
early this year.

02:23.041 --> 02:26.500
And I see you're going
as an evil monster devil child again.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.917
Oh, you added the word "evil"
this year. Nice touch.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.667
I like to keep it fresh.

02:34.709 --> 02:38.166
Anyhoo, I'm here to talk about the trouble
that you always have on Halloween.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.250
You mean the trouble
that started 11 years ago

02:41.333 --> 02:43.250
about the same time you learned to walk?

02:46.166 --> 02:49.834
Every year, your trees get toilet-papered
and your house gets egged.

02:49.917 --> 02:52.417
For just 50 dollars,
I can make sure that stops.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.875
So you're offering me protection...

02:55.667 --> 02:56.875
from you.

02:59.458 --> 03:01.083
From an unnamed hooligan.

03:01.333 --> 03:02.834
Named Gabe.

03:05.917 --> 03:08.166
Who hurt you so bad that you can't trust?

03:10.291 --> 03:13.542
All right, fine. I guess I have no choice.

03:14.125 --> 03:16.625
- You've got a deal.
- All right.

03:16.834 --> 03:19.166
I'll just take that 50
and we'll move on with our lives.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.917
Uh, I don't have that kind of money
just sitting around.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.083
I'm gonna need a little time.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.291
All right.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.333
You better hurry.

03:30.792 --> 03:33.208
It gets dark very early this time of year.

03:34.709 --> 03:38.208
I love Halloween.

03:40.625 --> 03:42.166
So do I.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.750
Well, Charlie, as you can probably see,

03:50.834 --> 03:56.041
uh, us Duncan's
take Halloween very seriously.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.250
I'm home.

03:58.333 --> 04:02.250
Oh, I wonder who that could be.
Why, it's Dad!

04:03.625 --> 04:07.208
Hi, I'm Bob, of Bob's Bugs Be Gone.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.250
How's your vermin?

04:12.583 --> 04:14.041
I'm home!

04:14.125 --> 04:17.834
Well, if it isn't... Ashley Tisdale?

04:19.709 --> 04:20.875
I'm Mom,

04:21.583 --> 04:24.959
and I'm a star. Ba-bam!

04:26.041 --> 04:28.875
Yeah? Well, well, I'm not an exterminator.

04:28.959 --> 04:31.208
I'm a pest control specialist.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.250
Did I ever tell you about the time

04:33.333 --> 04:35.917
I went to Southwest Denver
Community College?

04:37.375 --> 04:39.333
Me want donut. Me want donut.

04:40.417 --> 04:43.208
Well, things are getting a little ugly.
We'll see you at Thanksgiving.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.750
Hey, Gabe. You gonna put on your costume?

04:51.750 --> 04:52.834
Hey, everybody.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.792
- What are you supposed to be?
- I'm a goth wearing a mustache.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.834
Well, that's kind of a weird costume.

05:03.083 --> 05:04.750
Not as weird as little Bo peep.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.875
Well, actually, the little Bo peep costume
wasn't appropriate--

05:08.959 --> 05:11.375
there was not enough Bo,
a little too much peep.

05:12.250 --> 05:14.500
- Hmm.
- No, I'm Mary

05:14.583 --> 05:15.834
from "Mary had a little lamb."

05:15.917 --> 05:18.917
Oh! But I seem to be missing something.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.750
Oh, little lamb.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.500
- Go ahead, Charlie, say it.
- Baa.

05:31.166 --> 05:33.250
Carrots? Where's the candy?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.625
Oh, we're not giving out candy this year.

05:35.709 --> 05:38.875
I thought it would be fun to hand out
healthy snacks instead.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.375
We're gonna be that house?

05:46.083 --> 05:48.083
Oh, our first trick-or-treater.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.917
Carrots? You're that house?

05:58.250 --> 06:01.333
Ivy, we're going to a costume party.
Where is your costume?

06:01.417 --> 06:03.875
Oh, I've got a costume.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.291
That is so real.

06:13.333 --> 06:17.375
I was gonna put the cleaver on my head,
but I didn't wanna compete with all this.

06:22.834 --> 06:25.250
- Trick or treat!
- Oh, my gosh, a Teddy bear.

06:25.375 --> 06:28.750
That is so adorable.
You know, my name is Teddy.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.834
Trick or treat!

06:33.500 --> 06:34.792
Here you go, Teddy bear.

06:35.667 --> 06:38.083
Carrots. You're kidding, right?

06:40.417 --> 06:42.208
Teddy bear's got a little 'tude.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.917
- Happy Halloween.
- Thanks.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.667
Don't bother.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.375
Mrs. Dabney?

07:02.458 --> 07:05.333
Mrs. Dabney: Go away! This is a recording!

07:06.250 --> 07:07.917
It's Gabe!

07:10.542 --> 07:11.917
Huh! Ironic,

07:12.208 --> 07:14.917
considering all the times
I've thought about removing your head.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.125
I'm here for my 50 bucks.

07:19.208 --> 07:20.458
First sign this.

07:20.542 --> 07:22.583
- What is it?
- A contract,

07:22.667 --> 07:25.375
guaranteeing that nothing's gonna happen
to my house tonight.

07:29.667 --> 07:32.834
Now go away
before you attract the treat-or-trickers.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.917
You mean the trick-or-treaters?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.875
Whatever. I hate this holiday.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.125
I've got it.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.333
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:51.417 --> 07:54.208
Zoey, I'd like you to meet my Mom--
I mean my Dad--

07:54.250 --> 07:56.542
Guys, your costumes are too good.

07:58.208 --> 07:59.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.333
- Hey.
- And your costume is blowing my mind.

08:02.417 --> 08:04.208
- Right?
- Well, I guess.

08:04.375 --> 08:06.625
Um, who exactly are you supposed to be?

08:06.709 --> 08:08.959
My sister. She looks like this.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.959
Wow. Now I get it.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.041
My parents are dressed as each other.

08:15.125 --> 08:17.709
- Yeah.
- You remind me a lot of my parents.

08:17.792 --> 08:21.667
- Do they like to have fun too?
- No, I meant that there are two of them.

08:27.458 --> 08:28.792
Well, we should get going.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.542
- Have fun.
- Yeah. Bye.

08:34.583 --> 08:37.000
Wow, she's a spark plug.

08:38.208 --> 08:40.458
Hey, Beyonce Emmett's
looking better and better.

08:43.166 --> 08:46.083
Hey, kiddo, that your second costume?
It's kinda lame.

08:46.166 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, who cares?
Second time around is all about volume.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.125
- What do you want?
- I want to show you something.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.333
What? I didn't do this.

09:01.417 --> 09:05.917
Someone did, and I paid you 50 dollars
to protect my house.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.041
But it wasn't me.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.250
But it will be you cleaning it up.

09:11.041 --> 09:13.041
Huh! I don't-- I don't think so.

09:13.125 --> 09:16.125
Let's take a closer look
at the contract you signed.

09:17.583 --> 09:18.709
Right there.

09:19.917 --> 09:22.834
"If provider, Gabe Duncan,
fails to protect said residence,

09:22.917 --> 09:25.500
the provider, Gabe Duncan,
agrees to work for Mrs. Dabney

09:25.583 --> 09:28.750
for one full day--"
Work for you doing what?

09:28.834 --> 09:29.875
Keep reading.

09:30.709 --> 09:32.792
"Doing whatever Mrs. Dabney tells him to."

09:34.083 --> 09:36.625
- You tricked me.
- And that's my treat.

09:48.875 --> 09:49.875
Ooh.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.333
Go ahead, Charlie.
Go get a piece of candy.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.208
- Charlie!
- I'll get her.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.542
That was hilarious!

10:03.625 --> 10:05.667
No, it wasn't. What is wrong with you?

10:05.750 --> 10:07.375
What's wrong with you? It's Halloween.

10:07.458 --> 10:10.208
Yeah, but scaring a two-year-old
isn't funny. It's mean.

10:10.291 --> 10:12.166
She's only two?

10:12.250 --> 10:14.083
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.917
- Here, take some extra candy.
- Thank you.

10:23.583 --> 10:26.709
Oh! What?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.458
Aaah!

10:30.125 --> 10:32.709
Karl, one. Trick-or-treaters, zero.

10:32.792 --> 10:35.834
Oh, what is that horrible smell?

10:35.917 --> 10:38.000
I added some rotten eggs
to the fake blood.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.500
It's kind of my secret sauce.

10:39.583 --> 10:43.250
Ugh! I can't go to a party
smelling like this.

10:43.333 --> 10:46.375
A party? I'm sorry. I didn't know.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.417
Reach into the cauldron.
There's some perfume in there.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.792
Oh, reach into your own cauldron,
you clump nugget!

10:57.667 --> 11:00.291
I hate that Karl kid!

11:00.792 --> 11:03.083
I mean, no one would even talk to me
at the party.

11:03.166 --> 11:06.000
Can you blame them?
Mary had a little smell.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.083
We need to teach Karl a lesson.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.250
Well, can you teach it from over there?
You've still got a little stink on.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.667
Ivy,

11:18.500 --> 11:19.875
I want revenge.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.750
Okay, so what's your plan?

11:24.333 --> 11:25.375
How about this?

11:25.917 --> 11:28.083
I get a library card in Karl's name,

11:28.583 --> 11:30.458
I check out a lot of books

11:30.542 --> 11:34.375
and I keep them well past their due dates.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.792
Okay, I'm no good at this. Help me.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.500
Okay, fasten your seat belt.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.166
Ivy's gonna introduce you to...

11:46.750 --> 11:48.041
the dark side.

11:54.875 --> 11:57.333
I hate November 1st.

11:58.208 --> 12:00.959
Yeah, that's the problem
with malted milk balls--

12:01.041 --> 12:03.542
One's too many and 1,000 aren't enough.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.041
No more candy ever again.

12:09.166 --> 12:12.166
- Right after this piece.
- Nuh-uh. That's it.

12:12.583 --> 12:13.583
I'm throwing the rest out.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.417
Ooh, caramel.

12:15.959 --> 12:16.834
Hey, everybody.

12:19.250 --> 12:23.083
Uh, you do know Halloween's over.
Why are you still wearing your costume?

12:23.166 --> 12:25.583
This isn't my costume.
This is my new look.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.959
So you weren't in costume last night?

12:29.041 --> 12:31.917
Well, sure I was. Hello, fake mustache?

12:34.458 --> 12:36.583
- PJ, you're a goth now?
- That's right,

12:36.667 --> 12:39.000
and because I'm the total opposite
of what I used to be,

12:39.083 --> 12:41.041
from now on call me JP.

12:43.709 --> 12:46.542
If you're the total opposite,
shouldn't we call you Albert Einstein?

12:48.500 --> 12:49.333
Albert who?

12:50.375 --> 12:53.542
P.J., I don't understand.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.709
- Why are you doing this?
- Zoey.

12:57.917 --> 13:00.250
Oh! That's why.

13:01.291 --> 13:02.291
Hi.

13:03.208 --> 13:04.291
Hi.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.542
I think I like the sister better.

13:17.875 --> 13:20.250
Okay.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.083
All the egg's gone.
Can I take a break now?

13:23.166 --> 13:25.542
Hold on, let me check the contract.

13:26.917 --> 13:27.792
Nope.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.083
All right, what's next?

13:33.041 --> 13:34.834
I need you to give Kaboodle a bath.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.208
I'm not giving your cat a bath!

13:37.291 --> 13:40.583
- What else you got?
- Shave Mr. Dabney's back.

13:42.291 --> 13:44.208
Here, kitty kitty.

13:50.959 --> 13:53.291
That cat of yours
does not like taking baths.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.333
I know. That's why I had you do it.

13:59.375 --> 14:01.583
All right, what, what's next?

14:03.458 --> 14:05.208
You need to give Kaboodle his vitamin.

14:10.041 --> 14:11.625
Is he supposed to swallow this?

14:11.709 --> 14:14.250
Oh no, that goes in the other end.

14:16.625 --> 14:20.166
And if you thought
he didn't like baths? Ooh!

14:31.458 --> 14:33.417
Hey, Zoey and I are going out now.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.458
Don't wait up. We'll be back kinda late.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.875
- Where are you kids off to?
- Well, I suggested minigolf,

14:39.291 --> 14:40.875
but Zoey wanted to go to the cemetery.

14:41.208 --> 14:43.583
So we compromised--
We're going to the cemetery.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.667
- Who are you?
- I'm PJ

14:49.166 --> 14:50.417
No.

14:51.917 --> 14:54.083
Thank you for reminding me. I'm JP Now.

14:55.166 --> 14:59.250
Okay, well, whoever you are,
are you sure about this goth thing?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.709
Mom, Dad, don't worry.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.000
I'm still the same guy you know and love.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.625
Oh, Mom, by the way, I ran out of eyeliner
and I had to borrow some of yours.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.208
Bob, what are we gonna do about this?

15:13.291 --> 15:16.125
- Nothing.
- Doing nothing isn't my thing.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.375
Trust me, PJ Is gonna be just fine.

15:21.458 --> 15:22.625
Forgot my nail Polish.

15:24.667 --> 15:25.667
And if he isn't,

15:25.750 --> 15:27.959
then we've got all these other kids
we can pin our hopes on.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.875
All right, I've done everything
you've asked.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.417
Can I go now?

15:36.792 --> 15:38.458
Well,

15:40.041 --> 15:43.083
I hate to see a beautiful day end,

15:44.959 --> 15:48.667
but you can go
after you take out that trash.

15:48.834 --> 15:49.834
All right.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.333
What's all this?

15:56.083 --> 15:58.417
Egg cartons, toilet paper rolls.

15:58.709 --> 16:01.208
You set me up.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.083
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.542
You egged and T.P.'d your own house.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.208
Who hurt you so bad that you can't trust?

16:17.542 --> 16:18.959
Well played, Mrs. D.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.208
You are a worthy adversary.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.000
As are you.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.000
- Until next year?
- I'll be here.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.667
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, Karl, come on in.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.875
Come on. Look, have a seat.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.667
Listen, I've got to warn you
about my friend Teddy.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.291
You ticked off the wrong person.

16:44.375 --> 16:46.458
So what, I'm supposed
to be afraid of her now?

16:46.542 --> 16:48.208
Very afraid.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.125
She has problems...

16:50.375 --> 16:52.792
anger problems.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.959
Mary had a little lamb has anger problems?

16:57.041 --> 17:00.250
Yes, and when you messed
with her little lamb,

17:00.375 --> 17:02.959
scary is where Mary is sure to go.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.291
Teddy: Ivy, I'm back.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.834
Oh no. Okay, this isn't good.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.959
Stay here. I'll deal with this.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.959
Ivy: Don't get mad. Karl's here.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.542
Teddy: What? What, he's here?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.959
Who brought him into this house?

17:26.041 --> 17:27.625
Ivy: I just wanted to make peace.

17:27.709 --> 17:29.875
Teddy: I told you not to get involved!

17:29.959 --> 17:31.667
Ivy: What are you doing?

17:32.250 --> 17:34.375
Put that down! No!

17:35.041 --> 17:37.709
No!

17:42.875 --> 17:44.333
Save yourself.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.250
She's not right.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.250
Hello, Karl.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.333
Don't hurt me.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.333
Oh, don't worry.

18:06.583 --> 18:10.375
In a minute, you won't feel anything.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.875
Ha!

18:11.959 --> 18:13.667
Please, I'm sorry!

18:14.625 --> 18:17.208
Let me go!

18:17.583 --> 18:20.750
No!

18:20.834 --> 18:22.834
Yeah, you keep running, Karl!

18:22.917 --> 18:24.500
And don't come back!

18:24.583 --> 18:27.041
That was awesome.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.667
You were awesome.

18:29.166 --> 18:30.959
Great plan, smart plan.

18:31.041 --> 18:32.875
You know, you're a genius.

18:32.959 --> 18:36.750
Oh, you're a genius.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.458
- Locked out?
- Locked out.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.250
"But the fact is I was napping,

18:47.333 --> 18:49.750
and so gently you came rapping,

18:50.250 --> 18:52.333
Man: and so faintly you came tapping,

18:52.667 --> 18:55.083
tapping at my chamber door,

18:55.834 --> 18:57.583
Man: that I scarce was sure I heard you--

18:57.959 --> 18:59.875
here I opened wide the door,

18:59.959 --> 19:01.834
- darkness there..."
- Be right back.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.709
Man: "Deep into the darkness peering,

19:04.792 --> 19:07.041
long I stood there wondering, fearing,

19:07.291 --> 19:10.917
- doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal..."
- Mom.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.417
Hi, sweetie.

19:15.291 --> 19:16.458
What are you doing here?

19:16.875 --> 19:18.083
Oh, just...

19:19.250 --> 19:20.667
paying my respects.

19:22.125 --> 19:22.959
To who?

19:24.875 --> 19:27.000
Ezekiel Fitchhorn.

19:29.583 --> 19:31.000
He died in 1928.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.250
Time does not heal all wounds.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.583
Really, Mom, what are you doing here?

19:36.667 --> 19:39.041
- Oh, PJ, come here.
- What?

19:40.333 --> 19:42.667
- Honey, I'm worried about you.
- Stop worrying.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.500
This is who I am now.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.166
It just doesn't seem like you.

19:48.667 --> 19:51.375
Honey, you're in the middle of a cemetery
at 11:00 at night

19:51.458 --> 19:53.875
when you could be at home in bed.

19:54.417 --> 19:57.250
- I do like to go to bed early.
- I know,

19:57.333 --> 19:59.333
because you're not a nighttime person.

19:59.417 --> 20:01.417
I know. I'm a daytime person.

20:02.291 --> 20:06.000
Aw. And look at you, all in black.

20:06.083 --> 20:09.125
- Black isn't me. I like pastels.
- Right.

20:10.208 --> 20:13.625
Sweetie,
when you're with the right person,

20:13.709 --> 20:15.792
you don't have to change who you are.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.333
Then why are you always trying
to change Dad?

20:18.417 --> 20:20.333
Because that's who I am.

20:20.917 --> 20:22.041
Oh.

20:22.125 --> 20:25.208
Honey, you are such a great guy,

20:26.250 --> 20:29.458
and somewhere out there
is a very lucky girl

20:29.542 --> 20:31.709
who will find that out. I promise.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.417
- Come here.
- Thanks, Mom.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.834
- So, are you gonna talk to Zoey?
- Yeah.

20:39.917 --> 20:43.208
I've just gotta be honest with her,
you know, tell her it's not working.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.083
"So that now, to the still
beating of my heart..."

20:47.166 --> 20:48.458
The police are here! Run!

20:52.375 --> 20:53.709
What was that?

20:54.583 --> 20:56.166
I don't like to hurt people.

20:56.917 --> 20:58.000
That's who I am.

21:04.417 --> 21:07.458
Well, Charlie, my trip to the dark side
went very well.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.000
- I showed her the way.
- Yeah.

21:11.125 --> 21:12.750
Turns out I like scaring people,

21:13.417 --> 21:15.000
And I'm good at it.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.625
Really good at it.

21:21.041 --> 21:23.291
Scarily good at it.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.208
Give it a rest, Mary.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.375
Good luck, Charlie.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.417
Well, hello, hello, hello.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.417
Do I know you?

21:47.500 --> 21:50.041
I am the ghost of Ezekiel Fitchhorn.

21:50.125 --> 21:53.458
You paid me a visit the other night.
I'm here to return the favor.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.667
- Come on in.
- Why thank you.

22:01.166 --> 22:05.333
Say, has anyone ever told you
you're the bee's knees?

22:05.875 --> 22:08.291
Uh, my great-grandfather.

22:10.250 --> 22:12.667
How would you like to make time
with a ghost?

22:13.041 --> 22:15.500
Oh, Zeke, that's really flattering,

22:15.583 --> 22:17.542
and if I were 90 years older and dead,

22:17.625 --> 22:19.667
I'd be all over that.

22:19.750 --> 22:23.250
Since I'm not...

22:24.375 --> 22:27.875
Ezekiel: Next time, a simple
"no thank you" will suffice.
