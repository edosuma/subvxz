00:10.302 --> 00:13.386
Whoo!
"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"!

00:13.514 --> 00:15.597
Flash FM!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.056
Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-bee!

00:17.184 --> 00:19.471
Will you warn me
when you're gonna "Mad Max"?

00:19.603 --> 00:21.344
I'm trying to finish
my opening speech.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.642
Didn't you finish that
like a week ago?

00:23.774 --> 00:24.774
I'm tooling it!

00:24.858 --> 00:26.770
This is history
I'm crafting here.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.564
You think I can pull
a Gettysburg

00:28.695 --> 00:29.936
and use the number "score"?

00:30.072 --> 00:31.984
Like "two score
and ten years ago"?

00:32.115 --> 00:34.448
Quinquagenary...
It's the 50th anniversary.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.659
- Quinquagenary.
- Quinga-dinga-dorko.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.449
Ha!
My little college boy.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.866
I'm so using that.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.240
Eat it, Lincoln.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:59.643 --> 01:02.932
Watch where you bounce
that bovine, boychik.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.977
No contamination?

01:05.107 --> 01:06.723
Eh, just a little show
we're putting on

01:06.858 --> 01:08.565
to keep out the lookie-loos.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.686
- Doctor.
- General.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.653
Welcome home.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.820
"Have a whale of a summit."

01:20.956 --> 01:21.956
Amazing.

01:21.957 --> 01:25.541
Was this gala catered by
Doc McStuffins, by any chance?

01:25.669 --> 01:26.669
Oh, my!

01:26.753 --> 01:29.541
Whale-shaped sweetmeat.
How gay!

01:29.673 --> 01:31.084
What a glorious confection.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.378
Oh! Dear Lord!
This isn't cake!

01:33.510 --> 01:34.921
This is iced cream!

01:35.053 --> 01:37.295
Ice cream? Put that down!
Those are <i>my</i> arteries.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.094
So, I'm living
at the dorms now.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.638
Probably come home for laundry
and stuff like that.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.414
I did that when I was young.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.770
You gonna pledge
Gamma Psi Delta?

01:45.897 --> 01:46.897
Should I?

01:46.898 --> 01:48.685
Sweetie, your grandfather
<i>and</i> your father

01:48.817 --> 01:50.183
were both in that fraternity.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.776
You're legacy.
You're a shoo-in.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.583
Why doesn't my dad tell me stuff
like that?

01:53.697 --> 01:56.030
Besides the fact that
he's a petty little asshole?

01:56.158 --> 01:57.677
<i>Including</i> the fact
that he's a petty little...

01:57.701 --> 01:58.701
what you said.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.698
It was a BB gun.
I shit you not.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.913
"From Russia with Love"?
You're kidding me.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.998
- A BB gun?
- The cool one?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.368
The one that looked like
the old Princess Leia gun?

02:08.502 --> 02:09.502
Uh, yeah.

02:09.545 --> 02:13.415
It was a Walther LP53,
not a PPK.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.212
Please!
Look at the barrel!

02:15.344 --> 02:16.835
It's heartbreaking.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.927
Why would James Bond have
a BB gun?

02:19.056 --> 02:21.548
Don't take this the wrong way,
but we were all pretty shocked

02:21.683 --> 02:23.015
you accepted our request.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.557
Well, my father officiated
the first summit.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.429
Can't let the old man
show me up.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.558
So it's either me or, uh, Dean.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.025
Ow.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.689
Second bell!

02:34.821 --> 02:38.110
Well, gentlemen,
I guess I will be your undoing.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.483
I will destroy you, uh...

02:40.619 --> 02:41.826
- Snoopy.
- Yes.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.615
I will destroy you, Snoopy.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.454
You will also suffer my wrath.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.288
Third bell.

02:49.419 --> 02:54.255
So begins the second summit
of the Treaty of Tolerance.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.585
The Guild
of Calamitous Intent Council,

02:59.721 --> 03:05.558
the O.S.I. Aggression Envoy,
both endowed by jus tractatum,

03:05.686 --> 03:08.770
have gathered here
at the quinquagenary

03:08.897 --> 03:11.184
of the signing
of the Treaty of Tolerance.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.808
Determined to ratify
the lawful foundations

03:13.944 --> 03:15.856
of right and proper hostility

03:15.987 --> 03:18.274
among the peoples
of organized aggression...

03:18.407 --> 03:21.866
Ooh! Well, I've heard this
speech about a hundred times.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.859
I'm gonna go look
around the compound.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.157
...conditions
of their constituents.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.871
Come with me, please.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.206
W... Uh... okay.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.917
...resolved by thus
pooling their resources

03:32.045 --> 03:35.789
to preserve the prosperity
of professional antagonism,

03:35.924 --> 03:39.088
have created
this Animosity Coalition

03:39.219 --> 03:43.930
and to this end have designated
as their plenipotentiaries

03:44.057 --> 03:47.516
for the Guild Council,
Phantom Limb.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.682
Victor at the Battle
of Cremation Creek.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.056
Dr. Mrs. The Monarch.

03:53.191 --> 03:57.481
Defender of the Guild,
Vanquisher of the Sovereign.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.228
Red Mantle.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.232
Author of the Articles
of Treachery.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.324
That's me!
All three volumes.

04:04.453 --> 04:05.660
Dragoon.

04:05.787 --> 04:10.031
Overseer at the execution
of the Iron Infidels.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.284
Hmm?
I don't recall that happening.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.126
And for the O.S.I. Aggres...

04:16.298 --> 04:18.630
I probably should've practiced.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.882
For the O.S.I. Aggression Envoy,
General Hunter Gathers.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.883
Collector of antique pipes
and overall badass.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.726
Special Agent Brock Samson.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.346
Slayer of henchmen
par excellence.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.020
Corporal... Snoopy?

04:36.151 --> 04:40.111
Owner of a Toyota Camry
in stunning blizzard pearl.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.400
And of course, Shore Leave.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.866
With a body like Arnold
and a Denzel face.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.665
I have this plastic dome
on my head

04:57.798 --> 04:59.664
with tubes coming out of it.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.757
- Can't help you, buddy.
- No need.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.799
The modifications to my brain
function as they... Okay. Bye.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.260
I have this plastic dome
on my head

05:11.394 --> 05:13.101
with tubes coming out of it.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.346
Oh, that's nasty.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.973
It's beautiful.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.276
Agent Kimberly McManus.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.323
Guild Stranger S-464.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.744
Shall we... patrol the compound?

05:33.875 --> 05:36.913
Forever, Agent Kimberly McManus.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.921
Seriously, sir,
I'm Hank Venture.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.381
I used to live here.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.920
My dad is the bald dude

05:44.052 --> 05:45.932
dressed like the Colonel Chicken
Restaurant guy.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.883
- So could you just...
- Shut it, civilian.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.326
You're going to prison where you
have to get tattoos of Thor

05:50.350 --> 05:52.467
or you're gonna be treated
like a blow-up doll.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.718
Dermott?

05:53.854 --> 05:56.767
Fictel, private second class,
sir!

05:57.816 --> 06:00.308
Skin it, pin it,
see you in a minute.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.106
Bring it high, bring it low,
bring it down to my toe.

06:03.238 --> 06:07.323
Slap the back, sneak attack,
just don't ever hit my sac.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.531
Hello?

06:14.666 --> 06:18.785
I saw that the lights were on,
so I thought I'd stop by.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.834
Hello?

06:23.425 --> 06:25.792
H.E.L.P.eR.?

06:25.927 --> 06:28.761
Correct.
You must be Dr. Venture's son.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.176
I've heard so much about you.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.520
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Decorum, please!

06:37.647 --> 06:38.647
Gentlemen!

06:38.773 --> 06:39.854
You are kidding!

06:39.983 --> 06:41.519
How many times
are you gonna say that?

06:41.651 --> 06:43.517
Oh, you know what I...
I just... I-I...

06:43.653 --> 06:45.770
I meant "gentlepeople"
or something.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.239
You're pissing on my leg
and telling me it's raining!

06:48.366 --> 06:51.484
Just one agent dispatched
to a Level Five engagement?

06:51.620 --> 06:54.363
- One?!
- One agent is plenty.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.704
We're talking a Level Five.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.368
That's like a guy
called Mr. Cold

06:57.500 --> 06:59.583
with his snow-cone-maker
on high.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.452
You're afraid of a Level Five?

07:01.588 --> 07:03.375
One agent is too many, honestly.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.706
You're kicking me in the balls

07:04.758 --> 07:06.478
and telling me
that my undies are too tight!

07:06.593 --> 07:09.882
Any O.S.I. intervention implies
that a truckload of shit

07:10.013 --> 07:12.005
is in a very large van!

07:12.140 --> 07:14.507
1989...
Dr. Deep versus Furious Red.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.101
One city block leveled,
two civilian deaths,

07:17.228 --> 07:19.140
and four photos sent
to the tabloids.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.060
That, gentlemen,
was a Level Five arching.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.649
But Dr. Deep leveled the block

07:23.777 --> 07:25.860
with an unregistered
pulse cannon.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.604
Dr. Deep is a protagonist.
He's <i>your</i> boy.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.697
The antagonist, Furious Red,

07:30.825 --> 07:33.693
had his rib cage shattered
by that stupid cannon.

07:33.828 --> 07:34.944
Died a week later.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.696
Ugh.
You're missing the point.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.448
That bloodbath was
a Level Five arching.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.168
With Level Eight weaponry
by your affiliate

07:43.296 --> 07:45.379
that you refuse to oversee!

07:45.507 --> 07:48.045
Uh, have a seat,
Council... person.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.256
We'll go over supervision
of membership conduct soon.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.677
Let's keep on topic.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.639
One agent dispatched,
two Level Five failures.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.348
It's a gift.
Take it.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.560
You're throwing up in my hair
and telling me it's shampoo!

07:59.688 --> 08:00.769
It's no deal!

08:00.897 --> 08:02.263
One.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.981
You're shoving your hand
up my ass

08:04.109 --> 08:05.896
and telling me
you're Jim Henson.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.269
We want two agents.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.739
Long ago,
in a time before earbuds,

08:12.867 --> 08:15.826
during the age of the landlines
and personal checks,

08:15.954 --> 08:17.570
there was a great man.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.744
So enormous was his love
for the convenience of mankind

08:20.875 --> 08:23.913
that he gave them a H.E.L.P.eR.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.038
The world thanked this man
with money.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.712
Mankind was finally free of
the burden of helping themselves

08:30.844 --> 08:32.961
and could pursue
loftier aspirations,

08:33.096 --> 08:34.928
like trying to be
more attractive,

08:35.056 --> 08:36.388
enjoying liquors,

08:36.515 --> 08:39.350
and having
adult birthday parties.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.764
Also, sleeping late
was appreciated.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.808
All was reasonable...

08:43.940 --> 08:47.058
till the day man turned
on his electronic slaves.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.230
All of the H.E.L.P.eR.s
were destroyed

08:49.362 --> 08:51.149
and never spoken of again...

08:51.281 --> 08:54.194
forgotten like so many
Tamagotchi pets.

08:54.325 --> 08:57.159
Only I survived
the great recalling.

08:57.287 --> 09:01.497
I was rescued by Master Ben,
who gave me a purpose, a voice,

09:01.624 --> 09:04.116
and also a super-great
personality.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.541
I was his assistant
until the day he flew away.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.879
What?
Ben died?

09:09.007 --> 09:12.466
No. He took an airplane to shred
the heavies at Papatowai.

09:12.594 --> 09:13.755
Why didn't you go with him?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.129
To New Zealand?
I don't belong there.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.596
I'm an abomination.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.260
I will never leave this place.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.758
Would you like to use
the bathroom?

09:20.894 --> 09:21.930
Why do you say that?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.429
Because humans make piddles
and poopers.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.181
Would you like some Thin Mints
or comfortable sweatpants?

09:27.317 --> 09:28.774
No.
The "never leave" part.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.268
Wait.
Why would I want that?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.986
Because they are the most
popular Girl Scout cookie.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.948
No, but... but why would you...
Wait. Hold on. Sweatpants?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.612
Because I can heat them up
in the dryer

09:37.744 --> 09:39.952
to slightly above
your body temperature.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.915
Being that you're warm-blooded,
it's a real treat.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.204
Okay. Yeah.
I'll take the hot pants.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.501
The face... off limits.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.004
This is what brings all the boys
to the yard.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.926
W... I-I can't find
anything about this

10:00.058 --> 10:01.515
in the original treaty.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.852
He insulted my bloodline.
This is my right.

10:04.979 --> 10:05.979
To be fair...

10:05.980 --> 10:08.597
and I'm being as delicate
as a flower petal...

10:08.733 --> 10:12.773
your grandfather did have
rather singular tastes.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.736
I have 44 seconds on the clock.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.026
If I hear a bone break
or something, I don't care.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.569
It's over when I call "time."

10:18.701 --> 10:19.942
This is nuts!

10:20.078 --> 10:21.535
This can't be sanctioned.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.029
It is our way!

10:23.164 --> 10:26.578
My dear boy, it was your father
who invented this tradition.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.575
Of course, you had
a swimming pool back then,

10:28.711 --> 10:30.543
but it's basically
the same thing.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.047
So begins the pool battle!

10:42.183 --> 10:45.517
Gentlemen... fight!

10:47.939 --> 10:50.898
Still, you got
no military training.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.232
I-I'm just saying.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.569
Yeah, but I've got a black belt
in ninjutsu, dingus!

10:55.697 --> 10:56.983
Whoa!

10:57.115 --> 10:58.947
A black belt
from Sensei Rosenberg

10:59.075 --> 11:01.658
at the community rec center
got you into elite forces?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.153
Yeah, that and a relative
kind of put in a good word

11:04.289 --> 11:05.905
if I don't admit we're related.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.327
- Who, your dad?
- Why would you say that?

11:08.459 --> 11:11.372
'Cause you said your dad was
in black ops when we first met.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.962
Yeah, yeah.
That guy... obviously.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.504
King of the Super Jacket Crag!

11:18.386 --> 11:20.969
Yeah, but I-I kept slipping
on the raincoats!

11:25.852 --> 11:27.514
Dude, hide!

11:30.023 --> 11:32.390
What shoe?
I-I don't even see a shoe.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.766
Whoa!

11:36.112 --> 11:37.819
Your robot friend is beautiful.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.563
He can't talk.
He just beeps.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.736
Sometimes you can kind of tell
what he's beeping,

11:41.868 --> 11:43.985
but mostly it's like talking
to a microwave.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.487
He was the prototype,
so he's smart.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.206
The production models
were more like Speak & Spells...

11:49.334 --> 11:50.575
simple machines.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.872
But you're... You can talk.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.747
Master Ben didn't just modify
my electronics.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.589
He combined them with organics.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.300
I'm not a robot,
and I'm not a man.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.171
I am, in a way, like you.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.639
You are?
H-How do you figure that?

12:05.767 --> 12:07.133
Wait. I...
Oh!

12:07.268 --> 12:09.976
Wow. I-I thought by now
you would've been told.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.346
Oh, geesh.
You look dazed!

12:12.482 --> 12:13.482
The last 15 seconds

12:13.608 --> 12:15.770
have just been a figment
of your human mind.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.986
So flawed and prone to fantasy.
You're hallucinating!

12:19.113 --> 12:20.900
H-How many claws
am I holding up?

12:21.032 --> 12:22.489
Do you mean the clone thing?

12:22.617 --> 12:25.485
Wait! Y-Yeah.
So you do know?

12:25.620 --> 12:29.409
Yeah. Ben told me.
But I'm a clone of me.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.078
You're something... new.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.247
Yet we were both made
by great men

12:34.379 --> 12:36.166
who were compelled by love
and guilt.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.959
We are second chances.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.299
Yeah.
I guess so.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.043
Would you like a stick of gum
to make your mouth minty

12:43.179 --> 12:45.045
without providing nutrients?

12:45.181 --> 12:46.797
The summit is doomed.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.095
Soon we will unleash
our dastardly plan

12:49.227 --> 12:51.640
upon the Guild and the O.S.I.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.933
We will control
everyone's brain.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.978
Nothing can stop us.
There's no hero strong enough.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.692
None that we know of, at least.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.982
Well, let me introduce myself.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.777
Hank's the name.
Venture's the game!

13:03.908 --> 13:06.696
It's also the name.
Bass solo!

13:06.828 --> 13:09.411
â™ª Boo-dah-dah-dah-bah,
boo-dah-dah-dah-bah-boo â™ª

13:10.748 --> 13:12.114
That's a hot lick!

13:12.250 --> 13:15.038
Kee-ya-ooo!

13:15.169 --> 13:18.879
Saleenathor, let me ride
upon your magic back!

13:19.007 --> 13:21.294
Kee-ya-ooo!

13:21.426 --> 13:23.133
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!

13:23.261 --> 13:25.753
Hank, we'll be late
for the charity ball!

13:25.888 --> 13:27.008
I'll have to meet you there,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.177
forever 19-year-old
Dominique Dawes.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.973
I've got to ride a dragon
into a pile of danger!

13:33.104 --> 13:34.970
Yah!

13:37.400 --> 13:39.187
Thank you, woodland friends!

13:43.948 --> 13:45.280
Yah! Ooh!

13:45.408 --> 13:47.946
Dude, that is mental.
What's up with the Afro?

13:48.077 --> 13:50.034
I didn't mean
a straight-up disco Afro.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.406
I meant that full, wavy hair,
like He-Man.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.873
Oh, yeah.
That's way better.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.492
What are they doing now?

13:56.627 --> 13:58.368
They're still making out.
No. Wait. Dude!

13:58.504 --> 14:00.461
He's going for second base.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.456
Let me see that.
Oh! Yep.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.335
Under the bulletproof vest,
over the sports bra.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.631
I'm saying it counts.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.927
That's O.S.I.
- issued bra stuff. They're super-complicated.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.766
He's got to say "good enough"
and move on.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.226
And that counts as second base.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.971
She's going in for third base.
The belt is coming off!

14:17.106 --> 14:18.722
Or is that lady second base?

14:18.858 --> 14:19.974
It's third.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.068
Anything she does in the
groinal area is third, Hank.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.188
- Gimme.
- Then what's lady second base?

14:25.323 --> 14:26.564
I never thought about that.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.316
Why do you have
pee-pee on your belt? Huh?

14:29.452 --> 14:30.943
Can you explain that?

14:31.079 --> 14:33.787
That was awesome!

14:33.915 --> 14:36.123
Mad scientists!
They're mad!

14:36.250 --> 14:38.583
They're antagonists!
Mad. Scientists.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.623
Your problem, registered or not.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.589
They're not <i>angry</i> scientists.
They're mentally ill scientists.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.175
Why are they automatically
our problem when they're mad?

14:47.303 --> 14:48.635
Aren't they all a little nuts?

14:48.763 --> 14:51.096
Scientists invented cellphones,
ziplocks,

14:51.224 --> 14:53.511
and every cool thing you own,
thank you.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.679
Let's stay on topic!

14:54.811 --> 14:56.598
Mad scientists...

14:56.729 --> 14:58.846
scientists that have gone
over the deep end.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.688
How can anybody call them
good guys?

15:00.817 --> 15:03.275
"Good guys"?!
Did you just say that?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.861
Are we using "good guys"
and "bad guys" now?

15:05.988 --> 15:06.988
Yeah!

15:06.989 --> 15:10.107
Let's stop dancing around and
acting all politically correct.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.111
We're talking good guys and
bad guys, and we all know it.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.488
That's how you see us?
Bad guys?

15:15.623 --> 15:16.784
How dare you!

15:16.916 --> 15:18.077
I dare pretty easily.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.145
You want me to pop your
other arm out of its socket?

15:20.169 --> 15:21.455
That jacket will fit better.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.125
Any time you'd like, Samson.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.091
Are you staring us down, sir?

15:27.218 --> 15:28.709
No. I'm smizing at you.

15:28.845 --> 15:32.259
I'm smizing TyTy-style.
Want to make something of it?

15:32.390 --> 15:34.848
Want to fight me for my golden
fleece, you fuckin' Hydra?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.092
Oh, it's go time!

15:36.227 --> 15:38.469
Oh, he's going to open up a can

15:38.604 --> 15:39.936
of very old whoop-ass!

15:44.944 --> 15:46.856
What was that sound?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.149
That!
What was that?!

15:48.281 --> 15:49.613
That's just your feet.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.902
Oh, this was a bad idea.
I can't do this.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.617
These woods could be crawling
with religious fundamentalists,

15:54.745 --> 15:55.906
ready to stone me to death

15:56.038 --> 15:58.371
because I'm not mentioned in
whatever book they quote from.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.866
There's nobody here.
You're perfectly safe.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.038
Just come on.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.786
Please.
I've changed my mind.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.413
I've changed my half-mechanical,
half-meat mind.

16:06.549 --> 16:07.756
I don't want to leave!

16:07.884 --> 16:10.968
There is a whole world out there
beyond Ben's house.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.508
The great recalling is over.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.130
So let's bring on
the witch hunt?!

16:15.266 --> 16:18.259
Oh, screw this noise!
I'm going home.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.260
No!
Just no!

16:20.396 --> 16:22.058
Not with that belt.
It's over.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.182
I will comply with your demands.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.229
"Comply"?
You'll comply?

16:26.360 --> 16:28.022
How can you be so cold?

16:28.154 --> 16:31.488
My amygdala has been rerouted
through my cerebral cortex.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.324
You could kill my dog
and I wouldn't get upset.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.694
But don't.
Bailey is a good boy.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.865
How could you?!

16:37.997 --> 16:41.115
You ruined everything
with that pee-pee belt!

16:41.250 --> 16:44.618
Please, Agent Kimberly McManus,
will you let me explain?

16:44.754 --> 16:46.211
Oh, yeah? How?
How?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.626
Do you have a pamphlet
or something for me to read?

16:48.758 --> 16:50.238
I can't believe
they're still on this.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.677
Why can't she just grasp how
unpredictable our plumbing is?

16:53.804 --> 16:54.840
I don't know, man.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.759
What if you were
about to slide into third

16:56.891 --> 16:58.507
and the base was all hosed down?

16:58.643 --> 17:00.851
You'd freak, too.
She's got a point.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.219
So what are we gonna do?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.846
I don't think
they're terrorists,

17:03.981 --> 17:05.938
but I am O.S.I., so, you know...

17:06.067 --> 17:08.150
I don't know
about O.S.I. protocol,

17:08.277 --> 17:11.361
but I say we deal with this
like we used to back in the day.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.355
Sniper rifles?
One to the brain?

17:13.491 --> 17:15.403
What?
No, psycho!

17:15.535 --> 17:17.276
We go tattle on 'em.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.288
You're a man.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.622
It doesn't matter that
you were made in a test tube.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.958
I'm a...
this... an abomination.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.203
No, no. In a good way.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.455
I don't have to think about
souls and gods.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.333
I don't have to worry
about where I go when I die.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.334
I'm cool.
Just... Just go.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.927
Don't worry about me.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.921
It's, like, sad.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.344
Like you gave up, like you have
nothing to live for.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.935
No, I have nothing to <i>die</i> for.
I have everything to live for.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.181
I love my life here.
I love Ben and our experiments.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.683
And we just got Netflix,
so I have "Skins,"

17:49.819 --> 17:52.687
that old show where British kids
have sex and take drugs.

17:52.822 --> 17:53.822
It's spectacular.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.613
You're <i>really</i> sure?

17:55.741 --> 17:59.030
Well, perhaps "spectacular"
is an overassessment.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.948
Okay. Fine.
I-I got to go.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.118
But just please tell me you know
what I meant.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.286
I know what you meant,

18:05.418 --> 18:08.161
but please tell me
you'll give "Skins" a go.

18:08.296 --> 18:11.505
I will.
Goodbye, H.E.L.P.eR. Model 2!

18:11.632 --> 18:14.090
Goodbye, Rusty Venture.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.465
Rusty?
Wait. You thought I was...

18:17.597 --> 18:19.805
Ok... Wow.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.440
Okay.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.730
So we scrap it?

18:32.862 --> 18:35.024
Well, if they won't listen
and be fair,

18:35.156 --> 18:36.818
I see no reason to continue.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.235
It's not entirely us.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.155
We tried to listen,
and they threw pens at me!

18:41.287 --> 18:44.155
I threw <i>a</i> pen at you.
That was <i>one</i> pen.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.498
How would you like it
if I threw a pen at <i>you?</i>

18:46.626 --> 18:48.117
- Ooh!
- You like that?

18:48.252 --> 18:50.460
Nice throw, Sandy Koufax.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.581
Hey, want me to try?
Won't be a pen.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.049
Oh! Oh! Oh! See that?
That's what I mean!

18:56.177 --> 18:58.260
They overreact to everything,
see?

18:58.387 --> 19:00.128
I get it.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.721
I suddenly get it.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.636
You're children.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.556
That's why my dad put you in the
pool and made you duke it out.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.851
News flash...
My dad was a shitty parent.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.689
When my boys cry about fairness,

19:11.817 --> 19:14.400
I remind them that fairness is
the philosophical tooth fairy.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.235
There <i>is</i> no fairness.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.900
- What'd you guys come here...
- Um...

19:18.032 --> 19:19.239
Fine!
Not "guys"!

19:19.367 --> 19:22.235
What did you <i>children</i>
come here for?

19:22.370 --> 19:26.410
Look, you won't get everything,
but you'll get <i>something.</i>

19:26.540 --> 19:29.749
Stop with this "fairness" crap
and make some compromises.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.855
Then go home to your friends
in their goofy costumes

19:31.879 --> 19:33.962
and brag about how much
you got 'em!

19:35.633 --> 19:38.216
<i>Or</i> you can go back and go, "Oh!

19:38.344 --> 19:40.552
We didn't get everything
we wanted,

19:40.680 --> 19:45.391
so we got nothing
because we're big babies!"

19:45.518 --> 19:47.305
What's it gonna be?

19:47.436 --> 19:50.304
Fine.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.897
O.S.I., are you gonna play nice

19:53.025 --> 19:54.937
and actually get
this stupid thing signed?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.064
All right.
I guess.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.358
Good. Now look over my changes
and sign it.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.901
It's as fair as it'll get.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.069
And trust me...

20:02.201 --> 20:04.909
It's way better
than my dad's version.

20:08.874 --> 20:14.165
So begins the signing
of the new Treaty of Tolerance!

20:14.296 --> 20:18.165
I swear I will practice more
if we ever do this again.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.337
Well, we'll look into that.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.259
Could've lived
without all that pee-pee talk,

20:25.391 --> 20:27.303
but I'm glad you brought this
to us.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.676
What's your name, soldier?

20:28.811 --> 20:30.143
Private Fictel, sir!

20:30.271 --> 20:32.513
You keep it up, son.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.187
Private, did, uh, you catch
that Guild operative's name?

20:36.318 --> 20:38.401
S-464, sir ma'am, sir!

20:38.529 --> 20:40.691
Spot-on diplomacy.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.281
I never would've guessed.
Just spot-on.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.368
Truly, sir, just a bang-up job.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.953
Thank you.
Uh, is he okay?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.915
Oh, he's fine.
It's well past his bedtime.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.874
The only problem is
when he's asleep,

20:54.003 --> 20:56.461
the whole right side of my body
tingles.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.831
Dean!
There you are.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.880
So, what was it like
watching your father kick ass?

21:03.012 --> 21:04.048
Right?

21:04.180 --> 21:06.137
Little bit of hero worship?

21:06.265 --> 21:09.053
Hard to look at your old man
the same, I bet.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.892
You hit the nail on the head
there.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.979
Unfortunately,
I kind of missed the summit,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.439
but I found out
how similar we are

21:16.567 --> 21:20.481
and that your dad may have been
a worse father than you.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.605
Wait. I thought you said
you missed the summit.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.110
I love you, Pop.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.160
Why are you wearing sweatpants?

21:57.691 --> 22:00.183
We have to put a tail on S-464.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.560
Oh, give him a break.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.436
Just a kid in love
with the wrong person.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.609
Limb, he had "PP" on his belt.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.607
It happens!
Even I do it!

22:07.743 --> 22:09.554
Sometimes you think you've got
it all out, and...

22:09.578 --> 22:11.945
No! Really?
Why would they fight over that?

22:12.081 --> 22:13.947
No, he had "PP" on his belt.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.075
The letters... "P" and "P."

22:16.210 --> 22:17.826
All members
of the Peril Partnership

22:17.962 --> 22:20.204
wear a belt buckle
with two P's on it.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.298
Hello?
We have a mole.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.174
Ooh!
