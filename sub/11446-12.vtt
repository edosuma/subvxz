WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:02.953
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.045 --> 00:04.456
May I introduce Alexander Randall,

00:04.546 --> 00:07.163
the younger brother
of Captain Jonathan Randall.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.669
Didn't I see you talking
to Mary Hawkins earlier?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.501
<i>You know her? Enchanting girl.</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:12.960
<i>You are unwell, Alex.</i>

00:13.096 --> 00:15.428
It's not the future that Mary
has envisioned for herself.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.132
You should set aside your feelings.

00:17.226 --> 00:20.344
<i>Mary Hawkins and Jonathan Randall
were to have a child together.</i>

00:20.771 --> 00:23.763
<i>Alex and Mary simply could not be.
For Frank's sake.</i>

00:23.941 --> 00:25.352
If we do not send men to fight,

00:25.484 --> 00:27.691
this rebellion will melt away.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.852
Dougal! Colum change his mind then?

00:29.947 --> 00:32.314
Colum's mind is his own.
It's no concern of mine.

00:32.406 --> 00:34.523
We sailed from France to fight a war.

00:34.618 --> 00:35.733
Let us fight.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.864
<i>Turns out you were right
about Prestonpans.</i>

00:37.955 --> 00:41.619
That means I'm also right about
the disaster awaiting us at Culloden.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.533
My Laird, is it true?
Are we turning back?

00:43.627 --> 00:45.493
Aye, we're going back
across the border.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.668
Home.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.307
- Aye, aye.
- Yea h .

02:34.738 --> 02:36.228
Where are we?

02:37.574 --> 02:39.360
Just outside lnverness.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.612
Is that good?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.864
We can rest here at least.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.863
Very well.
You look as if you need to sleep.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.582
Adam! Smiths!

03:07.270 --> 03:09.932
<i>It was hard to believe
that these were the same</i>

03:10.023 --> 03:13.516
<i>brave Highland warriors
who had beaten the British army</i>

03:13.610 --> 03:16.648
<i>at Prestonpans and Falkirk,</i>

03:16.738 --> 03:20.356
<i>who had marched triumphantly
into England.</i>

03:20.450 --> 03:24.159
<i>Five months of retreat with
not enough food and brutal weather</i>

03:24.246 --> 03:26.658
<i>had left them broken and demoralized.</i>

03:27.290 --> 03:30.123
<i>Our worst nightmare was coming true</i>

03:32.462 --> 03:35.671
<i>and I felt completely helpless
in the face of it.</i>

03:40.887 --> 03:43.299
Hey, take yer filthy hands off me.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.844
I'll say this for ye, Rupert,

03:46.935 --> 03:49.927
losing an eye hasna improved
yer disposition any.

03:53.442 --> 03:56.810
Well, what good is a rebellion
that runs from a fight?

03:57.404 --> 03:59.145
Ken what poor Angus would say?

04:00.824 --> 04:02.815
The same as poor Kincaid, I expect.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.194
"It's time we turned
and showed them our faces."

04:25.432 --> 04:26.672
Dougal...

04:28.518 --> 04:30.259
I ken yer men crave sleep,

04:30.353 --> 04:32.435
but I need you to take a patrol out,

04:32.522 --> 04:33.762
locate the enemy.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.439
Find out how close behind us
they are.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.516
The horses'll need feeding
afore we set out.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.352
Aye. Take whatever we have left,

04:39.446 --> 04:41.437
but find the British army for us.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.565
See that there's food here
when we return.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.367
The men's strength
is dwindling on a bannock a day.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.336
Murtagh, Lord George will be

04:58.715 --> 05:00.956
calling a war council shortly.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.634
I need ye to ride to lnverness,
fetch the prince.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.300
Ye'll find him at Thunderton
House, Batchen Lane.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.630
A war council, eh?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.802
I think we three ken
where that will lead.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.639
Culloden Moor lies but
a few miles east of here.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.146
The 16th of April, ye said.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.070
That's when history
records the battle.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.071
Three days from now.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.208
All that work,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.336
all that plotting,

05:45.095 --> 05:47.086
how the bloody hell
did we end up here?

05:50.100 --> 05:51.932
As ye say, Sassenach,

05:52.936 --> 05:54.597
it wasna from lack of trying.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.189
But dinna wave
the white flag just yet.

05:59.276 --> 06:02.439
There's still time
to avoid the fight we canna win,

06:03.947 --> 06:05.733
if I can make Charles see reason.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.526
I must see to the welfare of the men.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.282
Hopefully there's something to eat
in this Godforsaken place.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.957
I'll need to go into lnverness,

06:18.628 --> 06:21.370
see if I can replenish
my medical supplies.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.748
I won't be long.

06:43.570 --> 06:47.564
Ginger, chamomile, and arsenic.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.399
Will there be anything else, Miss?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.279
A bottle of laudanum.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.074
That's the second bottle
this week, Miss.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.781
It's a very strong medicine.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.158
A bottle of laudanum. Please.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.285
Mary?

07:04.007 --> 07:05.168
Claire.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.090
What on earth are you doing here?

07:08.011 --> 07:10.719
I assume you've come
with the Jacobite army.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.512
Everyone seems to think
there'll be fighting soon.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.098
Yes, that may be true.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.475
Why are you here?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.936
We sent you home after
what happened with the duke.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.104
Yes.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.440
And then Alex contacted me.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.150
You heard me correctly,

07:26.279 --> 07:28.816
I am here with Alex Randall.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.439
He got a position
assisting the overseer

07:30.533 --> 07:32.900
of a large English estate
near lnverness.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.280
And I decided to join him.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.783
Alex and I are to be married.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.036
That's wonderful.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.872
Is it?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.128
You pretended to be my friend.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.671
I am your friend.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.040
Alex told me how you convinced him

07:48.134 --> 07:50.216
that leaving me in Paris
was in my best interest.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.299
He was in very poor health.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.006
And he had no prospects
for employment, I...

07:56.142 --> 07:57.803
Here's your laudanum, Miss.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.976
Thank you.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.731
MEW-

08:05.568 --> 08:06.979
I'm sorry

08:07.737 --> 08:10.274
for any pain that I caused
you or Alex.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.696
I shouldn't have interfered.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.031
The situation, it was...

08:14.327 --> 08:15.533
It was complicated.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.075
Is Alex all right?

08:20.709 --> 08:22.825
He's going to be fine.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.159
I'm taking care of him now.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.044
Our landlady has a sickly child,

08:26.172 --> 08:28.163
and she's been advising me
on proper medicines.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.086
I see.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.923
Perhaps I could stop by?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.381
To see Alex and to apologise.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.011
If you wish.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.269
We've taken a room
at McGilvrey's boarding house.

09:02.083 --> 09:06.543
Gentlemen, I have studied
our situation carefully,

09:06.629 --> 09:08.461
and our choice is clear,

09:08.548 --> 09:11.381
the best spot
to join battle with the enemy

09:11.468 --> 09:13.550
is mere miles
from where we now stand.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.882
Culloden Moor.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.922
- Are we agreed?
- Aye.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.638
That is the perfect spot

09:23.480 --> 09:24.641
for the British.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.597
With that, I do agree.

09:27.776 --> 09:31.895
Culloden Moor is flat,
plain ground, sir.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.150
Without sufficient cavalry
and artillery,

09:34.240 --> 09:35.947
our lines will be smashed to pieces

09:36.076 --> 09:37.862
before our troops
can even engage the enemy.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.738
Aye, Clan Fraser, perhaps.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.820
But the MacDonalds
will get the job done.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.909
Aye, and the Camerons.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.331
With all due respect,

09:46.127 --> 09:47.743
why fight at all?

09:52.175 --> 09:54.837
I implore you, Your Royal Highness,

09:56.304 --> 09:57.760
walk the camp.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.212
See for yourself

09:59.307 --> 10:01.423
the poor state of your army.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.137
The men are too exhausted
to fight a major battle.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.105
I refuse to listen to any more
of this coward's talk!

10:09.192 --> 10:10.432
Enough.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.813
There is still the matter
of the French gold.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.949
A large shipment, you may recall,

10:21.287 --> 10:24.200
supposedly sailed from the continent.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.954
With such funds,
we can secure food and weapons.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.998
While we wait for its arrival,

10:31.131 --> 10:33.418
we split the army into smaller units,

10:33.508 --> 10:36.045
making it more difficult
for the British to follow.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.752
Then, when our men are well rested

10:38.847 --> 10:40.554
and have the supplies they need,

10:40.640 --> 10:44.053
we choose the better ground

10:45.145 --> 10:47.056
to fight upon

10:47.147 --> 10:49.684
and defeat our enemy
once and for all.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.152
James...

11:00.827 --> 11:03.239
You are my most
loyal companion and friend.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.171
But I am not some frightened hare

11:16.009 --> 11:18.501
to be run down
by a pack of British hounds.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.052
I am a man.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.513
And I am a soldier.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.266
And I shall comport myself as one.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.348
I'm weary of retreat.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.866
The men will rest,

11:43.953 --> 11:45.864
and then we shall march to Culloden.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.205
Gentlemen,

11:50.793 --> 11:52.750
God will provide for us.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.791
We do His bidding.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.466
May He have mercy on us all.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.781
I've dissolved some
more arsenic in this tea.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.167
Mary, arsenic will bring colour
to his cheeks,

12:34.254 --> 12:35.585
but it won't help his cough.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.253
Madame Fraser.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.513
How good it is to see you.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.475
And you, Alex.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.185
Save your breath.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.179
She's right.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.270
I'll prepare a poultice

12:58.486 --> 13:00.443
to ease the muscles
on your chest and back.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.785
Johnny.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.949
You remember Madame Fraser.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.461
You said nothing about another visit
in your last letter.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.839
And where is your uniform?

13:26.556 --> 13:28.638
I was granted leave to see you.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.720
I didn't want to attract attention.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.186
So good to see you, Johnny.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.400
You're not leaving, are you?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.909
I don't know what would have
become of us without John.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.536
What do you mean?

13:55.877 --> 13:57.914
Alex has been unable
to work for weeks.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.502
We would be completely destitute

13:59.589 --> 14:01.079
if it wasn't for John
paying our bills.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.424
When do you think he'll be
able to get back to work again?

14:07.430 --> 14:08.670
Mary---...

14:10.433 --> 14:12.299
I think you need to start

14:12.393 --> 14:14.509
making reparations with your family

14:15.688 --> 14:17.053
so you have somewhere
to go when Alex...

14:17.190 --> 14:18.680
When Alex what?

14:21.110 --> 14:22.726
He won't be going back to work.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.108
He can't be cured. I'm sorry.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.566
But he must be cured.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.583
Oh, God, Mary,

14:39.295 --> 14:40.626
are you pregnant?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.714
Does Alex know?

14:45.385 --> 14:46.466
Yes.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.718
- And John.
- Mary.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.643
Alex is asking for you.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.319
Madame Fraser.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.493
Claire.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.794
Do not take your animus for me
out on my brother.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.165
Alex has not drawn
an easy breath in weeks.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.172
His youth and vigour are
drowning in blood and phlegm.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.090
Cure him.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.217
As I've explained to Mary,

15:33.307 --> 15:34.968
I cannot help him.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.013
What are you saying?

15:38.855 --> 15:40.596
Alex can't be cured.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.356
But you can ease his pain.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.785
I do not ask for myself.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.364
I ask for my brother and Mary

15:59.125 --> 16:00.536
and their unborn child.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.293
If I am to attend your brother,

16:09.510 --> 16:11.296
then I want something in exchange.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.806
You will tell me
where Cumberland's army is.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.679
My.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.894
You would barter over
an innocent man's suffering?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.191
Madame Fraser,

16:27.320 --> 16:28.651
you impress me.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.488
The woman I am now
is not the woman I once was,

16:31.866 --> 16:33.322
Captain Randall.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.198
We'll never rid
ourselves of that man.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.413
But perhaps this time,
his presence in our life

16:40.500 --> 16:42.366
-will be good for us.
- Nairn.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.375
Are you sure
that's what Randall said?

16:44.504 --> 16:47.121
That Cumberland's army
is encamped at Nairn?

16:47.215 --> 16:48.250
Yes.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.752
That's only 12 miles from here.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.678
And he said that two nights from now,

16:55.765 --> 16:58.097
there'll be a celebration
for Cumberland's birthday there.

17:03.231 --> 17:07.190
Well, that's very interesting
information indeed, Sassenach,

17:08.444 --> 17:09.809
if it's true.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.690
I actually believe him.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.898
Normally, I wouldn't,
but he seemed desperate.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.025
And we could confirm it, couldn't we?

17:17.118 --> 17:18.200
Aye.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.286
Aye.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.867
I want to go back and tend to Alex.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.167
I know it's a small act

17:27.255 --> 17:28.871
in light of everything
we're facing here,

17:28.965 --> 17:30.330
but I believe I owe Mary that much.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.131
And what if Alex dies in your care?

17:33.970 --> 17:36.462
What's to stop that evil
bastard brother of his

17:36.556 --> 17:38.422
sending you into
the next world after him?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.048
Murtagh could go with me.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.422
- Here, on yer feet, ye lazy swine.
- What?

18:12.508 --> 18:13.839
Would ye be so kind as to tell me

18:13.926 --> 18:15.166
what the MacKenzie's doing here?

18:17.346 --> 18:19.087
If I knew, I would.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.004
It's good to see some familiar faces.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.349
I was sorry to hear
about Angus' death.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.228
I always thought
when that wee bastard fell,

19:09.315 --> 19:11.477
that you would fall with him.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.726
So did I.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.453
Well, how long am I to stand here

19:29.543 --> 19:31.409
on these rickety sticks of mine?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.664
Find me a bed to rest in.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.005
Bring me my brother and my nephew.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.060
Ye're wasting yer time

19:58.197 --> 20:00.780
with all this prodding and poking.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.659
The healer who took
your place at Leoch,

20:05.746 --> 20:09.034
he's been looking more and more dour
these past few weeks.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.207
With good reason, I'm afraid.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.123
I've been dying for years.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.081
It's a wearisome process.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.876
I welcome its conclusion.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.090
Is that why ye travelled
all this way,

20:27.226 --> 20:29.263
in yer weakened condition?

20:32.481 --> 20:34.313
To hurry your death along?

20:35.443 --> 20:39.061
It would appear my brother
still gets satisfaction

20:39.155 --> 20:40.771
from keeping me waiting.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.147
Dougal isna in camp at present.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.487
He's leading a scout.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.998
I always said ye were a smart lad.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.753
Give my brother enough authority

20:57.840 --> 20:59.626
to keep him content,

21:01.135 --> 21:02.751
but not enough to allow him

21:02.845 --> 21:04.461
to grab for more.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.681
It's as if ye read my mind.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.183
While we await his return,

21:18.778 --> 21:21.691
I shall speak with Claire in private.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.111
I'll be close by,

21:30.331 --> 21:31.662
if needed.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.379
Here.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.798
My good lad.

21:48.682 --> 21:52.550
I commend ye on such
an admirable marriage, Claire.

21:55.898 --> 21:59.562
I remember a time when you
found our union less agreeable.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.813
I was wrong.

22:04.073 --> 22:07.191
That's one of the pleasures of dying.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.576
I can finally admit my mistakes.

22:12.748 --> 22:13.988
It also makes it easier

22:14.083 --> 22:15.744
to ask for favours.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.828
And I need one from you, Claire.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.166
My pain,

22:26.262 --> 22:29.345
it grows more tedious by the day.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.762
I'm sorry.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.389
I'll get you some laudanum.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.551
Laudanum, no, no.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.771
Laudanum just dulls the senses.

22:41.235 --> 22:44.023
I would prefer something more final.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.424
Suicide's a sin.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.924
What's one more sin to a sinner?

23:14.935 --> 23:17.973
Geillis Duncan gave
her husband a quick death.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.223
I would welcome the same.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.810
It may have been quick,

23:27.239 --> 23:29.822
but death by cyanide poisoning

23:31.410 --> 23:34.368
is an agonising way
to end one's life.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.571
I leave the details to you.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.913
I trust that you will give me
a kinder death

23:41.587 --> 23:43.248
than that bitch gave poor Arthur.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.754
Do not speak ill
of my friend Geillis.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.427
Memories...

23:54.308 --> 23:57.517
They remain raw
even longer than wounds.

24:00.648 --> 24:03.015
But I have a piece of news
to ease yer mind.

24:05.527 --> 24:07.359
Geillis' bairn lives.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.819
How?

24:12.952 --> 24:15.785
Geillis wasna burnt until after
the bairn was born.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.037
A boy-

24:24.213 --> 24:25.578
Where is he now?

24:25.673 --> 24:28.290
He's with William MacKenzie
and Sarah.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.549
They have no children of their own.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.054
Does Dougal know?

24:36.684 --> 24:38.425
I've never heard him
mention the child.

24:38.519 --> 24:41.637
The boy is but one more mistake

24:41.730 --> 24:43.892
my brother has to live with.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.266
This is yellow jasmine.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.270
It will be like drifting off
into a deep sleep.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.438
For when you're ready.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.199
For what it's worth,

25:45.544 --> 25:48.457
you have my deepest gratitude.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.257
Breathe.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.549
What are you doing?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.555
Mary, light a taper.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.895
Alex.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.982
He can't smoke that.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.025
It's a mixture of coltsfoot
and thornapple.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.403
- It will help open his airway.
- He can barely breathe.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.155
This will help him breathe.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.407
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.664
- Mary, I need you to hold this.
- No. No, no.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.911
Please.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.166
Hold this up to his face.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.838
Cover both his nose and his mouth.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.836
That's it.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.923
Okay, breathe it in. Breathe it in.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.474
Breathe deeply.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.265
That's it. One more time.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.099
Slowly, Alex.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.614
- Inhale.
- Breathe it deeply.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.110
- Okay.
- Deep and slow.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.366
Deep and slow.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.001
That's it.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.722
It's all right.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.311
MEW-

27:36.321 --> 27:37.732
You're okay.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.487
Here you go.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.486
There.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.994
There, there.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.574
Madame Fraser.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.750
It's all right.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.835
He's in pain.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.593
Yes, I know.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.849
Perhaps a bit more arsenic.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.051
No more arsenic.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.053
It won't do any good.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.939
Laudanum if he needs to sleep.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.936
But there's nothing more I can do.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.363
I'm sorry.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.031
Sorry? We had an agreement.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.532
You said you would help him.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.205
I am helping to ease his pain,

28:30.042 --> 28:31.373
but I can't cure him.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.417
If ye need to vent yer frustration,

28:33.545 --> 28:34.956
then I'll happily oblige ye.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.038
Stop it, both of you.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.290
Johnny.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.132
Johnny.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.894
Alex, what is it?

28:57.903 --> 29:00.895
I must ask you
to do something for me,

29:00.989 --> 29:02.320
for us.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.071
Anything.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.449
Know that I do not ask this lightly,

29:10.749 --> 29:12.911
but for the sake
of your love for me...

29:14.920 --> 29:18.504
Alex, I won't let
Mary or the child want for anything.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.080
You know that.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.791
Thank you.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.968
I've sent for the minister.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.633
The minister?

29:32.104 --> 29:34.436
No, not for last rites,

29:35.107 --> 29:36.643
not just yet.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.438
For your wedding.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.113
My wedding?

29:47.828 --> 29:50.115
You and Mary, dear brother.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.958
I need you to look after her, Johnny.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.049
We want

30:04.970 --> 30:07.462
our child to have the Randall name.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.382
Alex, you can do that
by marrying her yourself.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.968
Of course, I will see
that she is taken care of.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.803
As her husband,

30:15.897 --> 30:18.389
you can give Mary and our child

30:18.483 --> 30:21.396
some position in the world,

30:22.487 --> 30:23.977
so much more than I could.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.653
I commend the well being

30:33.415 --> 30:35.497
of those most precious to me

30:37.336 --> 30:39.748
to the one I have loved the longest.

30:59.441 --> 31:03.059
You think I am unaware of
the density of the dark wall

31:03.195 --> 31:05.607
you have built to protect
your better self

31:05.697 --> 31:07.187
from the world?

31:09.034 --> 31:11.275
But I have borne witness
to your tenderness,

31:12.954 --> 31:15.867
been the beneficiary
of your generous soul.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.996
That inner man is the one

31:20.087 --> 31:22.454
whom I entrust my love

31:24.549 --> 31:25.789
and my child.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.762
I'm sorry.

31:35.477 --> 31:36.763
I'm sorry.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.643
Captain Randall.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.141
Where the hell are ye going?

31:40.232 --> 31:41.438
Claire, please!

31:42.067 --> 31:43.523
Go after him.
I need to speak with him.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.645
Please.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.897
Coming.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.402
Hold it up to his face again.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.818
One more time, breathe.

31:57.749 --> 31:58.910
Dougal, what news?

32:01.128 --> 32:03.119
The British are camped at Nairn.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.625
- So I've been told.
- Oh, have ye?

32:06.007 --> 32:07.338
I wish ye could have been told

32:07.426 --> 32:08.916
before I did all that hard riding.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.672
I understand the British
are planning to throw a party

32:11.763 --> 32:14.130
in celebration
of Cumberland's 25th birthday.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.885
Well, we saw no such preparations.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.216
Where did ye get the information?

32:17.310 --> 32:19.517
Given to Claire by a British officer.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.934
Jonathan Wolverton Randall.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.516
Black Jack Randall?

32:25.652 --> 32:28.269
Well, there's a tale behind
that meeting, to be sure.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.604
And we're not giving
that bastard's word credence?

32:30.699 --> 32:32.690
No, not on its own.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.651
I've sent scouts to lnverness.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.449
It seems British commissary
officers have been seen

32:38.540 --> 32:40.451
purchasing wine and sweet meats.

32:40.542 --> 32:41.873
Food and drink is all
I've been thinking about

32:41.960 --> 32:43.621
on the ride back.

32:47.174 --> 32:48.380
What's this?

32:48.467 --> 32:50.799
There's little sustenance here,
I'm afraid.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.960
You'll have to postpone
partaking even in that.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.089
Why?

32:54.181 --> 32:55.797
My belly's crying out to be fed.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.803
Colum has arrived.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.477
I canna believe
yer encouraging this madness,

33:06.568 --> 33:08.809
all to save goddamned Frank Randall.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.815
Hasn't enough suffering been had

33:10.989 --> 33:13.230
in the name of saving
that mythical prick?

33:13.408 --> 33:16.241
Frank is neither a myth nor a prick.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.485
Oh, well, by all means, then,

33:18.580 --> 33:21.618
let us hand over the lamb
to be a plaything

33:21.708 --> 33:23.324
for that twisted, black-hearted wolf.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.785
Look, I realise it may seem
like I've made a deal

33:25.879 --> 33:27.495
with the devil himself,

33:27.589 --> 33:29.751
but Mary Hawkins needs a husband.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.003
Otherwise she and the child
will be starving on the streets

33:32.093 --> 33:33.583
and destitute.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.053
Then I will marry her.

33:44.940 --> 33:48.399
She's not the sort of woman
I'd ever imagine fer myself,

33:48.527 --> 33:50.939
not that I spend much time
doing that, mind ye.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.026
And I'm hardly the kind she fancies,

33:55.116 --> 33:58.199
if that soft lump Alex Randall
is any indication.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.947
But we could learn to get along.

34:04.876 --> 34:05.957
People do.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.208
I've never been a father,

34:10.297 --> 34:13.005
but Jamie's parents,

34:13.092 --> 34:14.958
they chose me to be his godfather,

34:16.304 --> 34:18.215
and I've watched over him.

34:19.599 --> 34:20.964
He didn't turn out too badly.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.141
You've been a wonderful
godfather to him.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.143
Mary and the baby
would be lucky to have you.

34:30.902 --> 34:31.937
But?

34:32.821 --> 34:34.277
We're at war.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.565
You could end up dead
tomorrow or the next day,

34:39.411 --> 34:40.822
and then where would they be?

34:42.621 --> 34:45.739
Captain Randall could share
the same fate, God willing.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.166
Yes, but as Randall's widow,

34:48.295 --> 34:49.376
she'd be entitled to his property

34:49.462 --> 34:50.998
and his officer's pension.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.580
Plus he has a
family pedigree and a station

34:53.675 --> 34:55.507
that her father might find
acceptable enough

34:55.635 --> 34:57.592
to let her come home.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.761
More acceptable than
a broken down Highlander

34:59.848 --> 35:02.465
with no home and no two sticks
to rub together, eh?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.264
I'm sorry to say, but yes.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.353
Aye.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.353
This is the place.

35:14.154 --> 35:15.235
Well, wait here.

35:15.322 --> 35:16.858
I feel it might go better
if I went alone.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.028
What kind of God creates a world

36:02.160 --> 36:03.992
where monsters thrive,

36:05.914 --> 36:07.404
beauty and purity is rewarded

36:07.499 --> 36:09.831
with poverty and death?

36:12.253 --> 36:16.417
The same God that also offers
an opportunity for redemption.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.211
You have to help me

36:23.348 --> 36:24.838
persuade him to give this up.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.680
Alex must marry the girl himself,

36:29.771 --> 36:32.058
give the child a father and a name.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.514
I will see that she
is taken care of, but I...

36:34.609 --> 36:37.943
What happens to Mary
when you're not alive to do that?

36:45.954 --> 36:47.240
Your curse.

36:49.541 --> 36:53.956
April 16th, 1746.

36:54.796 --> 36:55.877
Yes.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.289
The date of your death.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.962
Merely days away.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.843
And as your sister-in-law,
Mary is entitled to nothing,

37:06.933 --> 37:08.219
but as your widow...

37:08.351 --> 37:10.012
What if your curse proves untrue

37:11.187 --> 37:13.849
and the world continues
as it always has?

37:13.940 --> 37:17.183
The pure of heart choking
to death on their own blood,

37:17.277 --> 37:19.689
helped there, perhaps,

37:22.282 --> 37:24.444
by the monsters that walk among them.

37:26.619 --> 37:28.155
Have you ever harmed your brother?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.407
Never.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.166
Perhaps that immunity
will also extend

37:34.252 --> 37:35.788
to those he holds most dear.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.285
Perhaps.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.874
Is that good enough for you?

37:44.262 --> 37:45.969
Sometimes that's all we get.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.896
Did he never tell you

37:58.610 --> 38:00.567
the things I did to him in that room?

38:08.620 --> 38:09.735
Yes.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.116
I know the sound he makes
at the last,

38:16.252 --> 38:18.243
when he has lost himself.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.924
And I regret none of it.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.592
The pain,

38:29.682 --> 38:31.138
fear,

38:34.103 --> 38:35.593
I revel in it.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.768
Do you really want Mary in my bed?

38:43.613 --> 38:44.944
Help me.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.525
Persuade my brother to give this up.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.623
Alex will not listen to me.

39:02.382 --> 39:05.124
But you are sending your brother

39:05.218 --> 39:07.300
to his grave with a broken heart.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.342
If you love Alex,

39:11.474 --> 39:13.681
then I trust that that love is enough

39:14.978 --> 39:17.219
to stay your impulses with Mary.

39:31.494 --> 39:34.407
It grieves me
to see you so ill, brother.

39:34.539 --> 39:38.533
Congratulations on yer ability
to hide it so well.

39:38.668 --> 39:41.877
If so, it is because I also feel joy
at yer change of heart.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.205
What change would that be?

39:45.675 --> 39:47.131
Joining the MacKenzies of Leoch

39:47.218 --> 39:49.050
with our righteous rebellion,

39:49.178 --> 39:52.216
restoring the king across
the water to his throne.

39:54.851 --> 39:56.592
You think I've turned Jacobite?

39:58.021 --> 40:00.558
That I'm going to lead
the MacKenzies over the cliff,

40:00.690 --> 40:01.930
with you lot?

40:03.192 --> 40:05.559
Well, I may be dying,

40:06.738 --> 40:08.695
but I have not turned simple.

40:09.782 --> 40:13.070
If you didn't come to aid us,
then why come at all?

40:13.202 --> 40:15.614
There are matters, clan matters,

40:16.623 --> 40:19.866
that must be resolved
while I can still draw breath.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.218
I have declared my wish

40:33.389 --> 40:35.005
that my son Hamish

40:35.099 --> 40:37.090
be the next chief of Clan MacKenzie.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.223
Hamish is but a lad.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.681
Who will guide the clan
till he comes of age,

40:44.776 --> 40:47.484
teach him what it means to be chief?

40:47.612 --> 40:50.149
Ned Gowan can instruct him
in clan law.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.531
And I have chosen a guardian,

40:53.618 --> 40:56.952
somebody I believe
the clan will follow

40:57.080 --> 40:59.117
until Hamish comes of age,

41:00.083 --> 41:02.245
a man whose task it will be

41:02.335 --> 41:04.667
to guide the boy into manhood...

41:07.507 --> 41:10.465
To see that he learns

41:10.593 --> 41:12.925
how to choose what's best

41:13.012 --> 41:15.424
for the future of the clan

41:16.599 --> 41:19.933
and to thus demonstrate
his worthiness to be chief.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.648
James Fraser,

41:28.444 --> 41:30.606
I offer you this guardianship.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.487
You choose a Fraser
over a MacKenzie to lead the clan?

41:36.285 --> 41:38.117
Over your own brother?

41:39.956 --> 41:42.664
Deny me the boy's guardianship,
when by rights,

41:42.792 --> 41:44.703
you should be proposing
me as successor?

41:44.836 --> 41:46.167
Jamie is our sister's son.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.376
Ach, away.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.997
He shares our blood, and you know it.

41:50.133 --> 41:54.001
Besides, I am sceptical
that my support

41:54.137 --> 41:57.175
would be enough to convince the clan

41:57.306 --> 42:00.173
to choose you as their chief.

42:00.309 --> 42:02.641
Do ye not think the MacKenzies
would follow my leadership?

42:04.981 --> 42:08.599
Brother, if you were half as popular

42:08.693 --> 42:10.855
as you believe yerself to be,

42:12.238 --> 42:15.230
then there would be
more men here today

42:15.992 --> 42:17.858
in this army of yours.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.994
Has that thought
ever crossed your mind?

42:21.080 --> 42:22.991
Christ's bloody cross!

42:24.417 --> 42:26.203
I love Hamish,

42:26.335 --> 42:28.201
and he is considerably fond of me.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.577
He barely even knows Jamie.

42:29.714 --> 42:33.673
He's your spawn,
as you are very fond of reminding me,

42:34.052 --> 42:36.885
and I ken the deep affection
ye hold fer the boy.

42:37.013 --> 42:38.720
And I ken the real reason

42:38.848 --> 42:40.680
behind this loathsome
decision of yours.

42:42.018 --> 42:43.508
It's your last chance to punish me

42:43.603 --> 42:45.890
for fathering the son
that you never could.

42:47.899 --> 42:50.561
I do not have the strength
to pick at old wounds.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.899
It is the future of the clan

42:56.032 --> 42:57.898
that holds sway over my thoughts,

42:59.410 --> 43:03.244
and I will do all I can
to ensure that future.

43:03.372 --> 43:04.908
And what future would that be?

43:06.626 --> 43:08.913
Do you honestly think

43:09.045 --> 43:11.707
that Jamie will do anything
different from me?

43:13.132 --> 43:15.590
When you close yer eyes
for the final time,

43:15.718 --> 43:18.130
he will rally the MacKenzies
to our cause,

43:18.262 --> 43:20.924
and they will fight and die fer it.

43:22.308 --> 43:24.094
And damn your wishes.

43:27.772 --> 43:29.262
I'm honoured

43:30.399 --> 43:32.606
to be entrusted with
the care of yer son.

43:38.074 --> 43:39.610
But Dougal speaks true.

43:40.993 --> 43:43.826
I will use every option in my power

43:43.955 --> 43:46.117
to defeat the British,

43:46.249 --> 43:48.957
and that includes raising
the MacKenzie banner.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.460
I do not doubt yer fighting spirit,

43:56.592 --> 43:59.960
but I know that you will not

44:00.096 --> 44:02.804
sacrifice your men needlessly.

44:03.933 --> 44:05.298
If the cause is lost,

44:08.187 --> 44:12.101
then you will put the lives
of yer men above all else.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.656
You tell me that
you would do the same.

44:30.334 --> 44:31.620
Say the words,

44:32.837 --> 44:34.327
meaning them,

44:34.463 --> 44:37.330
in yer head and in yer heart,

44:37.466 --> 44:39.173
and the guardianship is yers.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.316
My poor brother.

45:01.908 --> 45:04.650
I have lived my life
crippled in body,

45:06.204 --> 45:09.492
and he has lived his
crippled in mind.

45:12.710 --> 45:15.168
In sickness and in health,

45:15.254 --> 45:17.040
forsaking all others,
be faithful unto her

45:17.173 --> 45:18.538
as long as you both shall live?

45:30.061 --> 45:31.267
I will.

45:32.355 --> 45:33.891
Miryam, will you take this man

45:34.023 --> 45:35.229
to be your husband,

45:36.108 --> 45:39.226
to live together forever
in the covenant of marriage?

45:39.403 --> 45:41.735
Will you love him, comfort him,
honour, and keep him

45:42.031 --> 45:44.238
in sickness and in health,
forsaking all others,

45:44.367 --> 45:46.779
be faithful unto him
as long as you both shall live?

45:53.376 --> 45:54.866
It's all right.

46:01.425 --> 46:02.631
I will.

46:09.433 --> 46:11.674
Will those of you
witnessing these promises

46:11.769 --> 46:14.386
do all in your power to uphold
the marriage of these two people?

46:18.067 --> 46:19.273
We Will.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.102
Aye, I Will. Get on with it.

46:25.741 --> 46:27.448
O gracious and everlasting God,

46:28.619 --> 46:31.452
look mercifully upon
this man and this woman,

46:31.539 --> 46:33.780
who come to you
seeking your blessing...

46:37.962 --> 46:39.623
A surprise attack?

46:42.258 --> 46:44.590
During Cumberland's
birthday festivities?

46:45.553 --> 46:47.043
I guarantee

46:47.138 --> 46:49.379
it will prove a birthday
he'll not soon forget.

46:50.725 --> 46:52.887
A birthday and a burial

46:53.394 --> 46:54.805
on the very same day.

46:54.937 --> 46:57.053
That will be worth celebrating.

46:57.148 --> 46:58.889
It doesn't sound very gentlemanly.

46:58.983 --> 47:01.816
I think we've all learnt
there's nothing gentlemanly

47:01.944 --> 47:03.275
about waging war.

47:04.155 --> 47:07.318
It would mean
a 12-mile march by night.

47:07.450 --> 47:10.659
And are the men capable
of such strenuous endeavour?

47:10.745 --> 47:12.486
They've not let us down yet.

47:13.414 --> 47:15.746
Lord George will lead one column,

47:16.334 --> 47:17.495
I the other.

47:18.794 --> 47:21.161
Together we will trap
the British between us.

47:31.015 --> 47:32.130
John?

47:32.808 --> 47:34.515
John, I look to you, as always.

47:38.606 --> 47:40.813
The plan has some merit, I'll admit.

47:42.485 --> 47:44.192
I will agree to it

47:44.320 --> 47:46.357
on one condition.

47:46.489 --> 47:49.948
Fraser, you and the general
shall ride together.

47:50.034 --> 47:51.866
The prince and I shall command
the second column.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.200
I'm not sure that's very wise.

47:53.329 --> 47:54.819
We accept your conditions.

47:59.377 --> 48:02.119
Well, then, gentlemen, it's decided.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.544
Mark me...

48:07.218 --> 48:09.550
I shall bring
my finest bottle of wine

48:10.971 --> 48:12.962
as a gift for Cumberland,

48:13.891 --> 48:16.724
and I shall present it to him
when he's my prisoner.

48:20.022 --> 48:22.229
It will be most amusing
to see his reaction.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.856
Very good, sir.

48:43.212 --> 48:45.078
Brought ye a wee drink.

48:49.844 --> 48:51.710
Will ye not leave me in peace?

48:53.389 --> 48:55.221
Ye reek of sour wine.

48:56.851 --> 48:58.182
Aye, I do.

49:00.020 --> 49:01.226
It's all that I could find.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.398
I've drunk enough
to muddle a stallion,

49:08.362 --> 49:10.569
and yet I remain as sober as a bairn.

49:20.624 --> 49:23.742
Oh, well, it appears
there is none left to share.

49:25.629 --> 49:26.915
Oh, Well.

49:28.090 --> 49:30.127
Perhaps it's for the best.

49:31.135 --> 49:33.467
God knows I have no wish
for you to think

49:33.554 --> 49:35.716
I would hasten
your leaving of this world.

49:39.143 --> 49:42.135
I am beyond any injury

49:43.105 --> 49:44.812
you could do to me.

49:45.649 --> 49:47.310
Nflqjury I youu?

49:56.952 --> 49:58.818
What about all the pain
you've put me through

49:58.954 --> 50:01.070
in this bitch of a life we've shared?

50:10.633 --> 50:12.465
Your life is your own.

50:14.803 --> 50:16.669
I take no blame for it.

50:18.265 --> 50:20.506
I still remember the day.

50:20.601 --> 50:22.183
You know, the...

50:23.521 --> 50:26.604
The day they brought ye back after
you'd been thrown by that horse.

50:28.776 --> 50:30.687
Was a stallion, I think.

50:32.112 --> 50:34.194
Too wild for a 10-year-old to ride.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.992
You were sorely injured, but...

50:42.164 --> 50:43.996
I knew you'd recover.

50:46.544 --> 50:48.000
You're my big brother.

50:48.128 --> 50:49.789
Nothing hurts you.

50:53.384 --> 50:55.000
Or so I believed.

50:59.390 --> 51:01.381
But you betrayed me, hmm?

51:04.687 --> 51:06.394
Instead of mending, ye got worse.

51:08.649 --> 51:11.391
And I watched ye every day,

51:12.736 --> 51:15.353
yer limbs getting
more and more twisted.

51:17.700 --> 51:19.532
I watched you shrink.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.160
And I hated ye for it.

51:28.002 --> 51:29.709
And with that hate,

51:31.505 --> 51:32.711
I wept.

51:36.552 --> 51:39.214
I wept more than I ever have
before or since.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.219
The world was never the same again.

51:50.566 --> 51:52.182
You destroyed it.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.235
No response?

52:10.586 --> 52:12.452
Damn yer soul, answer me.

52:14.632 --> 52:15.963
Answer me.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.466
Brother?

52:21.639 --> 52:22.925
Brother?

52:53.003 --> 52:54.414
Oh, brother.

52:57.007 --> 53:00.090
So ye turn yer back on me
one final time, eh?

53:04.014 --> 53:06.255
And ye leave me alone in the dark.

53:08.310 --> 53:10.301
The darkness of the world.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.855
And all I hoped to say to you...

53:18.654 --> 53:20.691
It remains trapped in here.

53:27.538 --> 53:28.869
Right here.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.036
Unsaid.

53:34.878 --> 53:36.164
Forever.

53:51.478 --> 53:54.721
All because you couldn't keep
yer arse on a bloody horse.

55:47.803 --> 55:51.216
I can't believe you encouraged
that wee slip of a girl to...

55:52.307 --> 55:53.638
To become his wife.

55:53.892 --> 55:56.133
I encouraged her to become his widow.

55:57.563 --> 56:00.225
Black Jack will die tomorrow

56:00.315 --> 56:01.555
at the Battle of Culloden.

56:01.650 --> 56:04.438
But if we succeed tonight,
there will be no battle.

56:04.528 --> 56:06.895
Then perhaps his death
will come about by some other means.

56:06.989 --> 56:08.104
And if it doesn't?

56:08.240 --> 56:09.947
Then I am prepared to keep my promise

56:10.033 --> 56:12.149
that I made to you in Paris.

56:14.663 --> 56:16.153
To help me

56:17.374 --> 56:18.705
bleed him.

56:22.254 --> 56:25.246
Remind me not to get
on your bad side, Sassenach.

56:34.182 --> 56:35.297
You be careful.

57:19.061 --> 57:21.974
Well, where in God's name
is that imbecile Charles?

57:22.731 --> 57:24.062
Was supposed to be here hours ago.

57:25.901 --> 57:27.016
Our army is spent.

57:28.695 --> 57:31.437
I fear we put too much faith
in starving men.

57:31.531 --> 57:32.737
I'd take a starving Highlander

57:32.824 --> 57:34.690
over a drunken British
soldier any day.

57:34.785 --> 57:35.991
Aye.

57:36.078 --> 57:37.489
We could attack it now

57:37.829 --> 57:39.820
and hope the prince's men
turn up in time.

57:39.957 --> 57:41.743
We have more chance here
than with what awaits us

57:41.875 --> 57:43.161
on Culloden Moor tomorrow.

57:48.715 --> 57:51.082
The prince and his men,
they turned back.

57:51.885 --> 57:53.626
They lost their way in the darkness.

57:53.762 --> 57:55.969
His troops are scattered
from here to kingdom come.

57:56.098 --> 57:58.180
Let me give the signal to attack.

57:58.266 --> 57:59.506
We're here.

57:59.601 --> 58:02.138
Oh, with only a portion
of our force, it would be madness.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.470
And with the dawn,
we'll lose the element of surprise.

58:04.564 --> 58:06.020
- No.
- I have no choice

58:07.109 --> 58:08.599
but to call off the attack.

58:09.820 --> 58:12.107
We march the army back to lnverness.

58:13.949 --> 58:15.030
General!

58:17.369 --> 58:19.736
Tomorrow the prince
will have his battle...

58:22.791 --> 58:24.407
On Culloden Moor.
