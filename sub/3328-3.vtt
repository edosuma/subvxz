"We Are Everyone"
Closed captioned

00:03.330 --> 00:05.560
MAN:
It's weird to think
that everyone on this street,

00:05.600 --> 00:07.761
everyone in this city,

00:07.800 --> 00:09.700
soon they're
going to want to know:

00:09.740 --> 00:12.334
Who is Ezra Kleinfelter?

00:12.380 --> 00:15.178
What kind of man puts his
country's secrets out there

00:15.210 --> 00:17.041
for anybody to read?

00:17.080 --> 00:18.502
Buddy?

00:18.550 --> 00:19.642
We're here.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.045
Sorry.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.115
Got distracted.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.185
Uh-huh.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.085
(beeping)

00:29.160 --> 00:30.184
(tires screeching)
Sorry, sir.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.583
Your card is
being declined.

00:31.630 --> 00:34.497
(tires screeching)

00:37.630 --> 00:39.131
My God.

00:39.170 --> 00:40.762
They froze my accounts.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.507
They know.

00:45.110 --> 00:47.078
You got another card?

00:47.110 --> 00:48.304
Cash?

00:51.550 --> 00:52.619
Hey.

00:52.650 --> 00:54.515
Hey, hey, get over here.

00:54.550 --> 00:55.778
Hey!

00:55.820 --> 00:57.344
Hey, over here!

00:57.390 --> 00:59.585
(horn honking)
Over here! He went that way!

01:00.790 --> 01:02.553
EMILY:
Devon!

01:02.590 --> 01:04.228
Devon, give that ball back.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.421
That's not your ball.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.792
Okay.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.821
That's good running.
(laughing)

01:10.870 --> 01:13.259
I don't know why you
volunteer to come here.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.268
It's like Lord
of the Flies.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.564
(phone chiming)
All right, let me just make sure
everything is cool.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.168
Jewel heist?

01:19.210 --> 01:20.768
Mad bomber
on the loose?

01:20.810 --> 01:22.243
No, there's no crime.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.349
Sherlock quizzes me sometimes.

01:23.380 --> 01:24.608
It's part of the work.

01:24.650 --> 01:26.709
Quizzes you about what?

01:26.750 --> 01:29.116
Dollhouse.

01:29.150 --> 01:30.447
Cute.
Yeah, Sherlock builds it.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.458
Is that doll supposed
to be dead?

01:32.490 --> 01:36.119
(laughs)
It's a way to practice
flash analysis of crime scenes.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.151
Suicide
by prescription meds?

01:38.190 --> 01:40.249
Ha. Who knew?

01:40.300 --> 01:42.165
So, are you getting
any "real world" time?

01:42.200 --> 01:44.191
Uh, this is...
this is pretty much it.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.391
You know, as
cool as it is,

01:46.440 --> 01:49.307
you spend your time chasing
thieves and murderers.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.137
You live with your
business partner.

01:51.170 --> 01:53.707
It might be a good idea to
carve out some time for...

01:53.740 --> 01:55.605
you know, regular stuff.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.902
Keep your options open.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.271
(phone chiming)

01:59.320 --> 02:01.914
Wow.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.542
That's a whole family
of dead dolls.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.911
Yeah. It's ghastly.

02:05.950 --> 02:08.180
"No foul play."

02:08.220 --> 02:10.154
Uh, keep my options open?

02:10.190 --> 02:12.158
What is that,
what, about dating?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.691
Okay, no, put that down.

02:14.730 --> 02:17.699
I know it's not your birthday
for a while, but...

02:17.730 --> 02:19.266
happy birthday.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.437
What is this?

02:20.470 --> 02:21.869
TrueRomantix.
What?

02:21.900 --> 02:23.162
It's a horrible name.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.302
It's a great site,

02:24.340 --> 02:25.466
from what I hear.

02:25.510 --> 02:27.171
Got you a six-month
membership.

02:27.210 --> 02:29.405
Oh, my God.
I even filled out
the profile for you.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.849
Use it, don't use it--
up to you.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.609
But, you know, use it.

02:32.650 --> 02:33.878
I meet people, you know.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.444
My life is not that weird.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.686
(phone chiming)

02:36.720 --> 02:38.915
Oh, my God.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.724
Staged suicide, obviously.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.422
No one sticks their head
In the oven anymore.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.293
Shut up. Please.

02:49.330 --> 02:52.231
If you're going to interrupt
my coffee time,

02:52.270 --> 02:55.831
you could at least make
the questions more challenging.

02:55.870 --> 02:59.601
(accented English):
You must tell me
how he became so skilled.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.733
Do you train with him?

03:01.780 --> 03:05.876
Train? I didn't even realize
we had a backgammon board.

03:05.910 --> 03:07.969
One can't bend the dice
to one's will.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.840
Ah, good. Watson.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.517
I see you've met
Mr. Mueller

03:11.550 --> 03:13.552
of Brussels.
Sort of.

03:13.590 --> 03:16.354
Mr. Mueller arrived
shortly after you left

03:16.390 --> 03:18.881
and has refused to state his
business until all parties

03:18.930 --> 03:20.795
were present.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.866
So...

03:22.900 --> 03:25.221
state your business.

03:25.270 --> 03:27.431
You're no doubt aware
that four days ago

03:27.470 --> 03:31.930
a civil contractor by the name
of Ezra Kleinfelter

03:31.970 --> 03:36.248
leaked a dossier
of national secrets

03:36.280 --> 03:37.440
to the media.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.845
It is believed
that he is sitting

03:38.880 --> 03:41.872
on more such
Information.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.758
Yes, I vaguely recall
the incessant

03:46.790 --> 03:48.883
media coverage.

03:48.920 --> 03:52.492
I represent a consortium
of like-minded citizens

03:52.530 --> 03:55.988
and we are concerned
about Mr. Kleinfelter's safety.

03:56.030 --> 03:58.828
We think that
certain other parties

03:58.870 --> 04:02.658
that are pursuing him
have something other

04:02.710 --> 04:04.598
than a fair trial
In mind.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.801
You're worried someone's going
to kill him?

04:06.840 --> 04:09.377
Your work comes
highly recommended

04:09.410 --> 04:11.549
by the Damery Corporation.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.468
Hmm.
We would like you to join

04:13.520 --> 04:15.647
in the pursuit
of Mr. Kleinfelter.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.944
If and when you find him,

04:17.990 --> 04:19.878
we would like you
to deliver him to us,

04:19.920 --> 04:23.048
_ and_we will in turn
bring him to an embassy

04:23.090 --> 04:24.819
that has promised
to provide

04:24.860 --> 04:28.057
safe haven until trial.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.068
Now, I under that
Mr. Kleinfelter's actions

04:30.100 --> 04:31.829
are controversial.

04:31.870 --> 04:34.691
So if you'd like a small
window of time to research

04:34.740 --> 04:35.968
the group
that I represent...

04:36.000 --> 04:37.365
No, that won't be necessary.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.559
We'll take the case.

04:38.610 --> 04:40.635
If you'll excuse us,
Mr. Mueller.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.443
My associate, she
gets rather grumpy

04:42.480 --> 04:44.903
if she doesn't take
her mid-morning nap.

04:44.950 --> 04:46.838
We will be in touch

04:46.880 --> 04:50.088
when we have secured
Mr. Kleinfelter.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.815
Thank you both
very much.

04:51.850 --> 04:53.852
Thank you.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.312
(door closes)

04:55.360 --> 04:56.827
Yes? Really?

04:56.860 --> 04:58.919
Sounds like aiding and
abetting a fugitive.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.598
Hmm. Excellent.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.052
I took that while
you distracted him.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.658
Good enough likeness,
don't you think?

05:03.700 --> 05:05.725
What are you going to
do with that picture?

05:05.770 --> 05:07.658
I once helped a Lebanese
agoraphobe retain copyright

05:07.700 --> 05:10.464
on a piece of facial
recognition software.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.068
I'm not saying the young lady
owes me billions of pounds,

05:12.110 --> 05:13.998
but I do think she can
analyze my portrait for me.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.406
I took the case because
I want to put Mr. Mueller,

05:16.450 --> 05:18.600
or whatever his name is,
at ease.

05:18.650 --> 05:22.381
We are going to follow him
and divine his nefarious plans,

05:22.420 --> 05:24.012
so we don't want his hackles up.

05:24.050 --> 05:25.483
Mueller's not
his real name?

05:25.520 --> 05:27.818
No Belgian is that bad
at backgammon.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.361
Of course Mueller has nefarious
plans for Kleinfelter.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.968
Why else the ruse?

05:44.010 --> 05:46.433
I'm not arguing
that he's a good guy.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.902
Can you just stop saying
"nefarious"?

05:47.940 --> 05:49.498
(phone chimes)

05:49.550 --> 05:51.677
That's like 15 times
in the last ten minutes.

05:51.710 --> 05:54.577
My agoraphobe responds.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.783
Yep, there are no
recent photos of anyone

05:57.820 --> 06:01.085
matching our man
on public record.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.453
But the orbital
ridge doesn't lie.

06:04.490 --> 06:07.425
I give you
Elliot Honeycutt,

06:07.460 --> 06:08.825
as he looked when
he entered

06:08.860 --> 06:11.920
Officers' Candidate
School in 1975.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.063
He entered the Q course
for Special Forces Training

06:14.100 --> 06:15.658
right after he graduated.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.804
He was discharged in '88,

06:17.840 --> 06:19.705
and he went to work
as a systems analyst

06:19.740 --> 06:21.435
for Everwood Communications.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.677
Since exposed by
The Sentinel as a CIA front.

06:24.710 --> 06:27.611
Currently VP of Corporate
Counterintelligence

06:27.650 --> 06:29.914
at...
Redding Enterprises.

06:29.950 --> 06:32.089
The same contractor
that, until recently,

06:32.120 --> 06:34.714
employed Ezra Kleinfelter.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.853
How did you know that?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.191
Redding.

06:42.230 --> 06:43.766
That man is not looking

06:43.800 --> 06:45.961
to bring Ezra Kleinfelter
to justice.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.036
He's looking to
eliminate him.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.533
WATSON: "Kleinfeltarianism."
Catchy name.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.003
Turns out that most of Ezra's
thoughts on a broken world

07:29.040 --> 07:31.975
have to do with how he can't
get a date with his neighbor.

07:32.010 --> 07:34.240
That, and a bunch of
Ayn Rand quotes.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.545
Philosopher-in-chief to the
intellectually bankrupt.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.218
Hey, we never talked about what
we're going to do with him.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.888
We are going
to gather data on him,

07:42.930 --> 07:44.124
and then we're going
to use that data

07:44.160 --> 07:46.697
to extrapolate
his current whereabouts.

07:46.730 --> 07:48.220
No, I'm talking
about after that.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.990
I mean, Ezra exposed some
pretty terrible stuff.

07:51.030 --> 07:53.134
Some people think he's a hero.

07:53.170 --> 07:56.833
Yet some would like to see him
hung from the nearest yardarm.

07:56.870 --> 07:59.031
You're asking
where I stand?

07:59.070 --> 08:02.005
I'm fairly certain that he
doesn't deserve to be stalked

08:02.040 --> 08:06.249
and possibly executed
by his former employers.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.976
It's funny. Most leakers,
they tend to release

08:09.020 --> 08:11.944
their information to multiple
sources at the same time.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.959
It's the best way to insure
that it is disseminated.

08:14.990 --> 08:18.255
But Kleinfelter dealt _
exclu5ively With one journalist,

08:18.290 --> 08:20.793
Celia Carroll
of the Dispatch.

08:20.830 --> 08:22.991
I wonder why.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.291
Oh.

08:26.330 --> 08:28.560
Well, she looks like that.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.307
Could have something
to do with it.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.830
I've already talked
to everybody in this city

08:32.880 --> 08:34.108
who carries a badge.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.607
Who are you guys again?

08:35.640 --> 08:36.902
Sherlock Holmes.
Joan Watson.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.577
We are consultants
with the NYPD,

08:38.610 --> 08:40.646
although our interest
in this matter is private.

08:40.680 --> 08:43.740
Okay. Well, I'll tell you
what I told everyone else.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.611
But I'm doing an on-camera soon,
so this has to be quick.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.685
(sighs)
I haven't heard from Ezra.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.927
I've no idea where he is.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.120
Before your
story came out,

08:52.160 --> 08:53.696
did he tell you
what his plans were?

08:53.730 --> 08:55.049
Well, sure, he planned
to leave the country

08:55.100 --> 08:57.125
before I published,
but that got scotched

08:57.170 --> 08:58.626
when Redding figured out

08:58.670 --> 09:00.831
he'd been downloading
classified material.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.805
Everything got pushed up,
Ezra had to go into hiding.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.809
Do you think he has a
romantic interest in you?

09:06.840 --> 09:08.808
Judging by his writings,
you're exactly his type.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.148
You're bespectacled,
you're lean

09:10.180 --> 09:12.273
and yet possessed of
an alluring curve of flank.

09:12.310 --> 09:14.346
CELIA:
Possessed of...?

09:14.380 --> 09:16.075
Look, you know what,
never mind.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.213
The couple of times we met
face-to-face, it never came up.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.786
So you no longer consider
him your source?

09:19.820 --> 09:21.082
You have no
reason to believe

09:21.120 --> 09:22.678
he's going to get
in touch with you?

09:22.730 --> 09:24.686
I already told you:
I don't know where he is.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.357
I'm not looking to help
anybody find Ezra,

09:26.390 --> 09:28.290
but even if I were,

09:28.330 --> 09:30.218
I'd be the last person
he'd get in touch with.

09:35.140 --> 09:37.358
You'd think someone
that ambitious

09:37.410 --> 09:38.968
would be a better liar.

09:39.010 --> 09:40.807
Hmm.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.070
You made _sure to ask her
where Ezra is a second time.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.839
She leaned back,
crossed her arms.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.371
When_ someone who's not used
to lying is forced to repeat it,

09:47.420 --> 09:50.116
they resort to
defensive posture.

09:50.150 --> 09:52.038
Ms. Carroll has been in touch
with Ezra Kleinfelter,

09:52.090 --> 09:54.115
but she's done it in
a way which has eluded

09:54.160 --> 09:55.855
the attention of
those obserVIng her.

09:55.890 --> 09:57.824
We're going to have to
analyze her movements.

09:57.860 --> 10:00.727
Determine how they're
communicating.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.888
We're about to sit around
for a very long time, aren't we?

10:06.100 --> 10:07.362
(sighs)

10:07.400 --> 10:08.958
HOLMES:
Ms. Carroll, it seems,

10:09.000 --> 10:10.865
will give an interview
to anyone with a camera.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.630
This is her fifth one today,
no sign of fatigue.

10:16.440 --> 10:20.911
Do you think we're cut off
from the world?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.145
You know,
neither of us dates,

10:24.190 --> 10:26.408
neither of us really
goes out much.

10:26.450 --> 10:28.953
At all, actually.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.958
We're not cut off
from the world.

10:30.990 --> 10:34.153
We're engaged in creating one
that's actually worth living in.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.862
One that addresses
our needs entirely,

10:36.900 --> 10:38.822
and_ eliminates
everything extraneous.

10:38.870 --> 10:42.294
Well, my friend signed me up
for this dating Web site,

10:42.340 --> 10:45.036
and I think I'm gonna
put my profile up.

10:45.070 --> 10:48.972
You know, so be nice,
ifI bring anyone around, okay?

10:49.010 --> 10:51.308
Won't be an issue.

10:51.350 --> 10:54.239
Oh.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.919
Our journalist tears herself
away from her adoring public.

10:56.950 --> 10:59.180
Why won't it be an issue?

10:59.220 --> 11:02.257
Because you won't actually
bring anyone around.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.827
I've lived most of my life

11:04.860 --> 11:08.921
with the firm conviction that
romantic love is a delusion.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.963
It's a futile hedge against
the existential terror

11:12.000 --> 11:13.968
that is our_ own
Singularity.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.867
Then I met someone who
calls herself Irene Adler,

11:16.910 --> 11:20.073
and_that forced me_ to
reexamine those conVIctions.

11:20.110 --> 11:22.806
She, of course, turned out
to be a criminal.

11:22.850 --> 11:27.275
Never really discussed
how that made you feel.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.118
Ifeel...

11:30.150 --> 11:32.141
liberated.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.956
I am, now and forever,
post-love.

11:36.990 --> 11:40.289
And, as such, I'm free to
pursue a life of meaning.

11:50.170 --> 11:52.809
HOLMES:
Oh, how very droll.

11:54.410 --> 11:58.107
So the security guard
is her conduit to Ezra.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.369
HOLMES:
We need to learn
how he's connected.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.741
Look through his phone
should do the trick.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.042
Yeah, think he's just gonna
give us his phone?

12:06.090 --> 12:08.149
No, of course not.
I'm going to pickpocket it.

12:08.190 --> 12:10.249
Of course, because you know
how to pick pockets.

12:10.290 --> 12:12.053
It's a fascinating art.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.456
It's all to do with establishing
trust and eye contact.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.060
Oh, I'll just have
to take your word for it.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.421
Good. And you'll
need this back.

12:22.810 --> 12:26.405
(hissing and buzzing)

12:26.440 --> 12:29.034
You just stole that phone.
Why are you nuking it?

12:29.080 --> 12:30.843
HOLMES:
Because it couldn't
be more dangerous

12:30.880 --> 12:32.973
if it was fashioned
from liquid Ebola.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.976
Hector, the security guard,
it seems,

12:35.020 --> 12:36.840
is a man of hidden enthusiasms.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.450
In his spare time, he
frequents a Web site called

12:39.490 --> 12:41.151
"Jamaica Quay."

12:41.190 --> 12:43.420
It's a gathering place
for identity thieves,

12:43.460 --> 12:46.850
intellectual property pirates,
other cyber-highwaymen.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.119
And judging by his posts
and his private messages,

12:50.170 --> 12:52.195
Hector is affiliated
with the collective

12:52.230 --> 12:54.266
that calls itself
"Everyone."

12:54.300 --> 12:56.461
Oh, yeah, the hackers
from the news.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.809
Well, they prefer to
describe themselves

12:58.840 --> 13:01.400
as "cyber activists,"
but yes.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.908
It seems that Hector
and his associates

13:03.950 --> 13:06.544
have taken up the banner
of Mr. Kleinfelter.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.468
They're committed
to getting him to safety.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.408
Hector has received

13:10.450 --> 13:13.010
a number of communiqus
from someone who calls himself

13:13.060 --> 13:14.357
"Defenestrator."

13:14.390 --> 13:15.880
They're speaking in code,

13:15.920 --> 13:18.457
but I am quite certain
that "Defenestrator"

13:18.490 --> 13:21.027
is harboring
Ezra Kleinfelter.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.961
Oh. So, what are we
supposed to do?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.228
Just look up
"Defenestrator"

13:25.270 --> 13:27.158
in the phone book
and we're good to go?

13:27.200 --> 13:28.497
Well, you are closer

13:28.540 --> 13:30.906
to a productive thought
than you realize.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.498
Jamaica Quay is anonymous.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.576
So you can't simply trace
the user name Defenestrator

13:34.610 --> 13:36.498
to an actual person.
You need to wait for them

13:36.540 --> 13:38.508
to reveal themselves.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.211
In other words,
you plan on arguing

13:40.250 --> 13:41.615
on the Internet all night?

13:41.650 --> 13:44.118
Yes.
I think I'm just
gonna take this upstairs.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.386
(rustling)

13:54.130 --> 13:55.859
(gasps)

13:57.030 --> 13:59.498
HOLMES:
I put Clyde in your bed

13:59.530 --> 14:01.634
in an effort to be a more
considerate flat mate.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.638
I've decided not
to wake you at dawn

14:03.670 --> 14:05.331
unless absolutely necessary.

14:05.370 --> 14:07.031
So you used
your pet turtle

14:07.080 --> 14:08.399
as an alarm clock?

14:08.440 --> 14:10.271
And circumstances
have dictated that

14:10.310 --> 14:12.039
I violate the spirit
of my resolution.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.638
It's been an eventful night.

14:13.680 --> 14:17.013
Defenestrator has proved to be
a canny piece of quarry.

14:20.020 --> 14:22.614
During the course of the debate,

14:22.660 --> 14:24.082
she revealed
that she lives

14:24.130 --> 14:25.984
within a three-block radius

14:26.030 --> 14:28.294
of the building that used
to house Ruben's Delicatessen.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.662
She?
That was around 2:00 am.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.588
I spent the rest of the night

14:32.630 --> 14:34.359
coaxing an employee
of Saturnware Computers

14:34.400 --> 14:36.095
into trying
to reveal

14:36.140 --> 14:38.529
who within that radius
recently purchased

14:38.570 --> 14:40.674
high-end equipment
suitable enough for hacking.

14:40.710 --> 14:44.407
My search yielded one
name-- Vanessa Hiskie.

14:44.450 --> 14:47.977
That's who's hiding
Ezra Kleinfelter.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.908
(knocking)
WATSON:
Vanessa?

14:52.620 --> 14:55.111
Vanessa Hiskie?

15:05.670 --> 15:08.298
Before you throw the last
tumbler, you might want to pause

15:08.340 --> 15:10.706
to consider the
beauty of this moment.

15:10.740 --> 15:13.004
We're about to succeed
where the combined wits

15:13.040 --> 15:16.703
of a dozen or so federal
agenCIes have failed.

15:16.740 --> 15:19.948
Remind me again what cloistered,
shriveled things our lives are.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.921
Ezra Kleinfelter?

15:50.310 --> 15:52.642
Sherlock.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.994
There are skin fragments
beneath her fingernails.

16:09.030 --> 16:11.624
I'm confident those will
yield the attacker's DNA.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.137
So, argument gone bad.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.637
And according to you,

16:14.670 --> 16:17.639
Ezra Kleinfelter's
been hiding out here?

16:17.670 --> 16:19.160
We haven't found
any concrete eVIdence

16:19.210 --> 16:21.303
that she had a guest, but yes.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.103
Which, considering
this place wasn't broken into,

16:23.150 --> 16:24.640
would have
to make him a suspect.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.773
I mean, I
don't get it.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.448
The whole world's looking
for this guy,

16:28.480 --> 16:30.311
she's willing to put him up
and he kills her?

16:30.350 --> 16:32.113
He didn't set
out to kill her.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.311
No, something went
wrong between them.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.023
Most likely a spurned
romantic overture, yes.

16:38.060 --> 16:41.291
Kleinfelter grew insistent,
Ms. Hiskie resisted...

16:41.330 --> 16:42.592
But we needn't have
a Socratic dialogue,

16:42.630 --> 16:43.790
Captain, 'cause we have DNA.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.661
Well, actually,
we don't.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.531
Kleinfelter doesn't
have any priors.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.299
I just double-checked
with VICAP.

16:49.340 --> 16:52.207
He was fingerprinted for
his security clearance,

16:52.240 --> 16:54.299
but he doesn't have
a DNA sample on file.

16:54.340 --> 16:57.707
So, in the messages that she
passed on to that reporter,

16:57.750 --> 16:59.308
Vanessa Hiskie, did...
she never referred

16:59.350 --> 17:01.318
to Kleinfelter by name?

17:01.350 --> 17:05.081
Excuse me. Did you find
that book in this box?
Yeah.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.519
It was in the closet. Why?

17:06.550 --> 17:08.711
Ezra Kleinfelter's
favorite author.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.728
Half the college kids in
the country have that book.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.125
Yes, but Vanessa's bookshelf

17:12.160 --> 17:13.422
is in her bedroom.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.348
Why would she leave
this one book out

17:15.400 --> 17:17.595
in this box
along with, uh,

17:17.630 --> 17:21.361
a map of New York,
a travel guide to Venezuela,

17:21.400 --> 17:23.231
a compass
and an unopened box

17:23.270 --> 17:24.567
of crackers?

17:24.610 --> 17:26.566
Ezra didn't hook up
with Everyone

17:26.610 --> 17:28.305
until a couple
of days

17:28.340 --> 17:29.739
after he was on the run,

17:29.780 --> 17:31.805
so he had to be hiding somewhere
during that time.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.444
I think he brought this box
with him when he came here.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.742
Let's get word out
that Kleinfelter

17:35.780 --> 17:38.214
is a person of interest
in a homicide.

17:45.430 --> 17:48.399
Please. I need a moment
free from the Internet.

17:48.430 --> 17:49.749
I'm trying to
drag myself away,

17:49.800 --> 17:51.358
but the people I'm
in conflict with

17:51.400 --> 17:52.594
are too infuriating
to ignore.

17:52.630 --> 17:55.133
Oh, you're still
fighting with people?

17:55.170 --> 17:56.467
I've been monitoring
"Jamaica Quay."

17:56.500 --> 17:57.660
It's frequented by
members of Everyone,

17:57.710 --> 17:59.200
so there's at least a chance

17:59.240 --> 18:00.707
one of them knows
where Ezra is hiding.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.674
But I have, of course,
been drawn into a debate

18:02.710 --> 18:04.268
as to whether Mr. Kleinfelter,
murder suspect,

18:04.310 --> 18:06.403
is the victim of a
government frame-up.

18:06.450 --> 18:07.678
Are governments
capable of evil?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.244
Yes, of course they are.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.542
A|| institutions are.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.387
But they're more capable
of incompetence.

18:12.420 --> 18:14.479
That's good.
I should post that.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.421
(sighs)

18:17.460 --> 18:19.325
What are you doing?

18:20.460 --> 18:21.791
I'm looking at profiles

18:21.830 --> 18:23.889
of guys who winked at me
on TrueRomantix.

18:23.930 --> 18:27.366
I weep for the whole
desperate lot of you.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.697
(phone ringing)

18:28.740 --> 18:30.367
Hello.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.503
MAN:
Hi. I'm calling
about your Web ad.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.508
Uh, I think
you have the wrong number.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.405
You don't have
a model train set?

18:36.440 --> 18:38.408
What? No.

18:40.180 --> 18:42.171
Well, I happen to think that

18:42.220 --> 18:44.279
_ Jeff Heinz _
of Washington Heights is cute.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.140
I'm gonna wink back.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.680
How's that for post-love?

18:47.720 --> 18:50.280
(phone ringing)

18:50.330 --> 18:51.729
Hello.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.194
MAN 2:
Hey, I can be there
in 20 minutes.

18:54.230 --> 18:55.697
Are the trains set up?

18:55.730 --> 18:58.164
Excuse me? Um, what is
this thing about the trains?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.168
Oh, you said
we can take our clothes off

19:00.200 --> 19:01.428
and play with the trains
together?

19:01.470 --> 19:04.337
What?!
(static)

19:04.370 --> 19:06.258
What is happening
with my computer?

19:06.310 --> 19:07.675
(doorbell ringing)

19:15.420 --> 19:17.638
Hey. Got your pies.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.352
Uh, we didn't order pizza.

19:20.390 --> 19:21.687
Um, yeah, you did.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.859
I-I got, like, 20 more larges
with pineapple

19:23.890 --> 19:25.653
in my trunk.
I'm afraid
you've been duped.

19:25.690 --> 19:27.396
This is for your trouble.

19:27.430 --> 19:29.352
Please see those pizzas find
a good home. Thank you.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.220
What is happening?

19:35.340 --> 19:36.637
Hmm.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.228
They most likely traced
the phone here

19:38.270 --> 19:39.498
before the microwave
destroyed it.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.975
Who-who traced the phone here?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.874
Hector the security guard
realized

19:49.920 --> 19:51.342
his phone had been stolen,

19:51.390 --> 19:52.948
and then tracked it
to this address

19:52.990 --> 19:55.709
before I realized he was
a member and destroyed it.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.455
He and his compatriots
have reasoned

19:57.490 --> 20:00.254
that the enemies
of Ezra Kleinfelter reside here,

20:00.300 --> 20:02.427
and now they plan to subject us
to a life-ruin.

20:02.460 --> 20:03.927
(phone rings)

20:03.970 --> 20:07.337
Have you changed your online
banking password recently?

20:07.370 --> 20:10.237
In the last couple
of weeks. Why?

20:10.270 --> 20:11.999
They can just get
into our computers like that?

20:12.040 --> 20:13.576
Well, amongst other places,

20:13.610 --> 20:15.407
but you should be all right
on that front.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.771
Your e-mail, social media sites,

20:16.810 --> 20:18.539
those passwords are not derived
from the names

20:18.580 --> 20:20.878
of family members,
are they?
Why?

20:20.920 --> 20:23.411
I don't think
there's any need to panic.

20:23.450 --> 20:26.510
Heartfelt apology still works
miracles, I've found.

20:26.550 --> 20:29.348
What am I apologizing for?
Where are you going?

20:29.390 --> 20:32.257
We're not going to get
any work done here.

20:36.030 --> 20:38.294
All right, thanks.

20:38.330 --> 20:41.299
Hey, did you guys know
your phones are disconnected?

20:41.340 --> 20:42.568
Yes.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.409
Any word on the
box that we found

20:44.440 --> 20:45.509
in Vanessa Hiskie's
apartment?

20:45.540 --> 20:47.804
We pulled some partial prints,

20:47.840 --> 20:49.899
but nothing matches
Kleinfelter.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.647
I need to examine
the contents of that box.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.011
I told you
it was a bust.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.574
Forensically, yes,
But Kleinfelter's on

20:55.620 --> 20:57.019
the front page of every
bloody newspaper.

20:57.050 --> 20:58.881
He doesn't exactly have
the run of the city.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.956
He had to go somewhere after
he murdered Vanessa Hiskie.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.059
He couldn't
reach out

21:02.090 --> 21:03.557
to everyone straightaway,

21:03.590 --> 21:05.421
not after murdering
one of their own.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.394
We also know that he wasn't
under their protection

21:07.430 --> 21:09.398
until two days after
he became a fugitive.

21:09.430 --> 21:10.567
You think he went back

21:10.600 --> 21:11.965
to the first place
he was hiding.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.434
Okay. So...

21:15.470 --> 21:19.304
Looks like he's somewhere...
in New York.

21:19.340 --> 21:22.503
Or Venezuela.

21:22.540 --> 21:25.407
And doesn't have anything
to spread his cheese on.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.073
This paper's... it's brittle.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.610
It's ready to crack.

21:34.820 --> 21:35.957
(spits)

21:35.990 --> 21:38.458
They went stale...
a long time ago.

21:38.490 --> 21:42.449
So why would Kleinfelter carry
around a bunch of old crackers?

21:47.770 --> 21:49.431
"O.C.D."

21:49.470 --> 21:50.937
The Office of Civil Defense.

21:50.970 --> 21:53.109
It's a Cold War-era bureaucracy.

21:53.140 --> 21:55.870
Amongst other things, they
maintained emergency bunkers

21:55.910 --> 21:57.548
for_officials to
use in case of...

21:57.580 --> 22:00.003
nuclear holocaust. _
They were stocked With supplies,

22:00.050 --> 22:02.610
food.
Ezra's hiding
in one of those bunkers.

22:02.650 --> 22:05.915
He took that box with him
when he went to Vanessa's.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.918
So how many
of these bunkers were there?
I don't know.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.655
Dozens. Maybe hundreds.
It's difficult to say.

22:09.690 --> 22:11.419
The Office of Civil Defense
closed down years ago.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.496
You can use the desk line.

22:14.530 --> 22:16.953
Mmm. He hardly ever
answers the phone anyway.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.094
Going to have to
pay him a visit.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.791
(birds chirping)

22:21.840 --> 22:24.809
You're telling me that one guy
lives in this building.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.435
Milton Van Kirk inherited
the estate from his parents.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.368
The man has spent
his entire adult life

22:30.410 --> 22:33.379
writing a biography
of Robert Moses,

22:33.420 --> 22:36.776
the builder who shaped much
of this city.

22:36.820 --> 22:38.515
Van Kirk just turned 75,

22:38.550 --> 22:40.086
and he has yet to
finish the manuscript.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.917
He's been writing
the same thing his whole life?

22:41.960 --> 22:42.949
His research has made him

22:42.990 --> 22:44.548
the world's foremost expert

22:44.590 --> 22:46.387
in the geography
of New York City.

22:46.430 --> 22:47.795
We've had
a delightful correspondence

22:47.830 --> 22:50.799
about the Delaware Aqueduct.
(buzzing)

22:50.830 --> 22:52.695
I have, however,
learned not to ask him

22:52.730 --> 22:54.061
about the progress
of his book.

22:54.100 --> 22:56.796
I recommend you
do the same.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.003
VAN KIRK:
The Office of Civil Defense
maintained...

23:00.040 --> 23:03.009
Let's see.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.076
Forty-one

23:05.110 --> 23:07.613
emergency bunkers
in New York City

23:07.650 --> 23:09.538
during the Cold War.

23:09.580 --> 23:11.548
But they were
all decommissioned

23:11.590 --> 23:13.558
by the time Clinton
took office.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.956
I don't know how your man
got hold of a box

23:15.990 --> 23:18.982
with a O.C.D. stencil.

23:19.030 --> 23:22.625
But those bunkers just
aren't there anymore.

23:22.660 --> 23:24.196
Can I...
can I look at those?

23:24.230 --> 23:25.959
Yeah.
Thanks...

23:26.000 --> 23:28.537
Milton.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.040
Look... two lists.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.638
Commissions, decommissions.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.875
The list of commissions
is 41 entries long.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.785
The list of decommissions 40.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.742
There is one
bunker situated

23:46.790 --> 23:48.849
in a caisson in the
Brooklyn Bridge,

23:48.890 --> 23:51.051
which was built but
never decommi55ioned.

23:51.090 --> 23:53.627
They must have just simply
just lost track of it.

23:53.660 --> 23:56.197
Ezra had access to government
records for his job.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.027
Maybe he noticed
the same thing

23:58.070 --> 23:59.628
that you did.

23:59.670 --> 24:00.659
Thank you, Milton.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.793
Wait.

24:05.140 --> 24:09.179
Can you help me?

24:09.210 --> 24:11.747
How did I end up agreeing

24:11.780 --> 24:14.010
to reading
a 5,000-page manuscript?

24:14.050 --> 24:15.745
Well, you won't be
wasting as much time

24:15.780 --> 24:17.486
on the Internet
now, Will you?

24:17.520 --> 24:19.613
So you're gonna need something
to fill up the hours

24:19.650 --> 24:21.618
you've spent selling
yourself to strangers.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.116
(man chatting
indistinctly nearby)

24:23.160 --> 24:25.253
Excuse me, might I
borrow your phone?

24:25.290 --> 24:26.757
It's police business.
I'm just...

24:26.790 --> 24:28.121
As soon as we pick up
Kleinfelter,

24:28.160 --> 24:29.718
we're gonna figure out
how to get

24:29.760 --> 24:30.920
these people
off our backs, okay?

24:30.970 --> 24:31.925
Excuse me.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.632
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

24:34.670 --> 24:38.128
I have to get a message to
Captain Gregson in Major Cases.

24:38.170 --> 24:40.536
Kleinfelter hiding.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.504
Brooklyn Bridge,
east caisson.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.903
On the way, all right?

24:44.950 --> 24:46.201
It's of paramount importance.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.808
Okay.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.545
So, you might consider
this something of a lesson.

24:51.590 --> 24:54.218
If you keep a discreet
digital footprint as I do,

24:54.260 --> 24:55.909
you're less vulnerable
to the harassment

24:55.960 --> 24:58.622
which is Everyone's
stock-in-trade.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.958
(blows whistle)

25:05.170 --> 25:06.296
Hey.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.195
Can you pop the trunk?

25:08.240 --> 25:09.696
(sirens Whooping)

25:09.740 --> 25:11.503
US. Secret Service!
Hands in the air!

25:13.170 --> 25:14.034
What's this about?

25:14.080 --> 25:16.173
You seriously think
we can't trace a blog

25:16.210 --> 25:18.144
back to an IP address?

25:18.180 --> 25:21.172
"44mustdie.com"--
sound familiar?

25:21.220 --> 25:23.586
It should,
because you posted it yesterday.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.110
And it's got the details
of four different plans

25:25.150 --> 25:28.051
to assassinate
the pre5ident of this country.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.955
That's a class-D felony.
Please, he didn't
put that up.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.719
We're being harassed.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.894
Once again, I have no designs
on the life of your president.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.999
I have no designs on the life
of any president.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.861
Although I suppose if I lived
in the age of Millard Fillmore,

25:46.910 --> 25:48.639
I might consider drastic action.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.002
We're talking about the
leader of the free world.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.347
This isn't a joke.

25:53.380 --> 25:55.848
Isn't it?
Because While we sit here

25:55.880 --> 25:57.689
and engage
in beef-witted debate,

25:57.720 --> 26:00.917
my pursuit of an actual enemy
of your state lies dormant.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.313
I've told you,

26:02.360 --> 26:04.282
call Captain Thomas Gregson
of the NYPD.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.979
We'll get to that.
You're in pursuit

26:06.030 --> 26:07.998
of the author of a series
of hate pamphlets

26:08.030 --> 26:11.067
who calls himself "Skrewdriver,"
are you not?

26:11.100 --> 26:13.318
I saw your bulletin board while
you had me waiting at the desk.

26:13.370 --> 26:15.338
You want to know
if he's a credible threat.

26:15.370 --> 26:18.134
If you make the call,
I Will tell you his identity.

26:18.170 --> 26:20.263
You couldn't know that.

26:20.310 --> 26:22.005
Couldn't I?

26:22.040 --> 26:24.201
I know that you, Agent Polk,
are in the latest stages

26:24.250 --> 26:26.275
of a divorce, and have recently
starting shaving your chest

26:26.310 --> 26:28.039
in anticipation of dating again.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.685
And if you won't find
alternative sources of protein,

26:30.720 --> 26:33.041
then you really need
to resume eating meat.

26:33.090 --> 26:36.218
Veganism is not a choice
to be made flippantly.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.798
I just spent three hours
answering questions

26:49.840 --> 26:52.968
on Whether or not I plan
to assassinate the president.

26:53.010 --> 26:55.035
I just heard from
Captain Gregson.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.844
By the time the police got
to the bunker, it was empty.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.098
This was all they found.

27:00.150 --> 27:03.244
Everyone is helping
Kleinfelter again.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.111
Gregson believes they were
monitoring the police band.

27:05.150 --> 27:07.755
Told him when the
officers were on the way.

27:07.790 --> 27:09.280
How did you get your phone
to start working again?

27:09.320 --> 27:10.309
Oh, it's not mine.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.987
I liberated it
from Agent Polk.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.179
(blows whistle)

27:20.770 --> 27:23.238
(doorbell ringing)

27:26.040 --> 27:27.871
Uh, hi.

27:27.910 --> 27:29.138
Hi.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.148
Uh, you're Joan,
you're Joan Watson?

27:31.180 --> 27:32.807
Y-Yes, and you are...?

27:32.850 --> 27:34.738
Oh, Jeff... Heinz.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.146
Uh, the guy from TrueRomantix.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.683
Okay.

27:39.720 --> 27:43.053
It's just that, you know,
we exchanged some nice messages.

27:43.090 --> 27:46.287
And then I got some
really weird stuff from you.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.025
Oh, no.

27:48.060 --> 27:49.357
They-they all had
your home address,

27:49.400 --> 27:50.822
which I thought was
a little weird.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.360
It's on your profile now, too...

27:52.400 --> 27:55.892
along With some... interesting
thoughts on same-sex marriage.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.430
Oh, my God, you know What?

27:57.470 --> 27:59.028
I-I know those things
are probably on my profile,

27:59.070 --> 28:00.469
but I did not write
any of those things.

28:00.510 --> 28:01.909
Yeah, I mean, I ki...
I kind of figured that.

28:01.940 --> 28:03.771
I'm no computer expert,

28:03.810 --> 28:05.744
_ but it seems _
like somebody's messmg

28:05.780 --> 28:07.077
with you pretty badly.

28:07.110 --> 28:10.011
So, um, I just wanted

28:10.050 --> 28:12.712
to make sure you're okay.

28:12.750 --> 28:15.059
Oh.

28:15.090 --> 28:16.955
Oh, hey, I-I hope
that's not too strange.

28:16.990 --> 28:18.787
No, it's-it's nice.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.422
HOLMES:
Right, hack this!

28:20.460 --> 28:21.996
Oh, God, that is my roommate.

28:22.030 --> 28:23.258
He's kind of a long story.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.426
You know what?
I-I would love

28:24.470 --> 28:25.994
to explain
all of this to you.

28:26.030 --> 28:27.759
Um, could I just have
a couple of days

28:27.800 --> 28:29.495
to sort some things out and
get things under control?

28:29.540 --> 28:31.064
Yeah.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.509
But, you know,
big picture, I am fine.

28:32.540 --> 28:34.735
Seriously.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.771
Thank you so much
for checking in on me.

28:36.810 --> 28:38.141
Yeah, of course.

28:38.180 --> 28:40.102
I-I hope to see you soon.

28:40.150 --> 28:41.344
Yeah.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.814
Good night.

28:43.850 --> 28:46.182
Good night.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.328
Everyone may have had
our power turned off,

28:51.360 --> 28:53.385
but they can't hack
our generator.

28:53.430 --> 28:55.796
The generator
powers the laptop,

28:55.830 --> 28:57.764
which_ is connected to
the neighbor's Wireless.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.529
I've opened a chat
on Jamaica Quay,

28:59.570 --> 29:01.959
so I can appeal
directly to Everyone.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.365
I've written them
a heartfelt plea

29:03.400 --> 29:05.834
for them to end their
campaign against us.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.839
Oh, because they're known
for compassion.

29:08.880 --> 29:11.269
Well, I'm expecting
nothing but mockery.

29:11.310 --> 29:14.347
But if I can engage them at all,
it might prove fruitful.

29:14.380 --> 29:17.269
At least some of them are
working with Kleinfelter.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.810
Perhaps I can goad them

29:18.850 --> 29:21.159
into revealing something
of their plans.

29:23.160 --> 29:26.288
Um, I asked you
about Irene yesterday.

29:26.330 --> 29:29.356
Her name is Moriarty.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.288
Sure, Moriarty.

29:31.330 --> 29:34.265
What she put you through
was cruel.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.528
And-and I don't think

29:35.570 --> 29:37.037
you've really dealt
with it yet.

29:37.070 --> 29:39.504
I submitted to one
recovery at your behest.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.007
There won't be a second.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.179
I...
(computer dings)

29:43.210 --> 29:45.872
"Shoe on head."

29:45.910 --> 29:48.140
They want me to upload
a photograph of myself

29:48.180 --> 29:50.375
with a shoe on my head
as it is a ritual

29:50.420 --> 29:52.047
of humiliation
for the tribe.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.081
Fine.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.552
Oh.
(sighs)

29:58.590 --> 30:00.285
Very well.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.491
Um...
(computer dings)

30:04.370 --> 30:05.928
(scoffs) No.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.938
I remind you we are
investigating a murder.

30:07.970 --> 30:08.937
No!

30:08.970 --> 30:10.437
(computer dings)

30:33.260 --> 30:37.151
They all just... left.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.963
Everyone is a collective.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.934
They don't take orders.

30:40.970 --> 30:42.938
Why would they just fall silent

30:42.970 --> 30:46.963
just because
"Jormungandr" says to?

30:52.510 --> 30:55.217
It's 9:00.
You didn't wake me.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.615
I didn't need to.

30:56.650 --> 30:59.483
We're quite free until
4:22 this afternoon.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.250
I thought a leisurely
breakfast might be nice.

31:02.290 --> 31:03.951
Mmm.

31:03.990 --> 31:05.981
And What is
happening at 4:22?

31:06.030 --> 31:07.486
Well, after you went
to bed last night,

31:07.530 --> 31:08.895
I spent some time reviewing

31:08.930 --> 31:11.262
Ezra Kleinfelter's options.

31:11.300 --> 31:14.963
He could try to survive as a
fugitive here in the States.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.230
That's a difficult life.
It's highly rislq.

31:17.270 --> 31:20.307
He could present himself
to a sympathetic embassy.

31:20.340 --> 31:24.003
His best option,
by far, is the third.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.439
Make his way to foreign
soil, gain asylum,

31:26.480 --> 31:28.016
live out his days.

31:28.050 --> 31:29.142
Wait, first of all,

31:29.180 --> 31:30.408
there's only
a handful of places

31:30.450 --> 31:32.042
that will take right now.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.513
I mean, everyone in the
country's looking for him.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.051
Public_ travel's out of the
question, I agree. Yeah.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.225
But private air travel
is far less regulated.

31:40.260 --> 31:42.148
The security measures
are minimal.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.088
What, so he needs
his own private plane?

31:44.130 --> 31:47.224
No, he needs an ally
with a plane.

31:47.270 --> 31:48.965
And a few days to make

31:49.000 --> 31:51.059
the necessary
arrangements.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.362
Jormungandr.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.100
The name of the member
of Everyone

31:58.150 --> 32:00.175
who got his compatriots
to toe the line.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.940
The name, of course,
refers to the third child

32:02.980 --> 32:04.140
of Loki and Angrboda

32:04.190 --> 32:06.545
in Norse mythology.

32:06.590 --> 32:08.387
Oh, of course,
because everyone knows that.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.012
He was a serpent
who grew so large

32:10.060 --> 32:11.220
he could encircle
the earth

32:11.260 --> 32:12.625
and swallow
his own tail.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.491
It's quite a
striking image.

32:14.530 --> 32:16.657
And it led me to the
man behind the alias.

32:19.130 --> 32:22.429
15 years ago, an Irishman
named Darragh O'Connor

32:22.470 --> 32:25.303
sold a nifty bit of software
that he'd written himself.

32:25.340 --> 32:28.173
It was his first and only foray
into the business world,

32:28.210 --> 32:29.575
but it netted him nearly
a billion dollars.

32:29.610 --> 32:31.305
Since then,

32:31.350 --> 32:32.977
he's spent his time primarily

32:33.010 --> 32:36.116
as an advocate _
for freedom of information.

32:36.150 --> 32:38.584
That's Everyone's pet cause.

32:38.620 --> 32:42.317
The name of the program
he wrote: Ouroboros.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.555
A snake eating his own tail.

32:44.590 --> 32:48.048
So Darragh O'Connor
is Jormungandr.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.591
Well, according to the FAA,
his private plane is scheduled

32:50.630 --> 32:53.463
to touch down here in New York
later this afternoon

32:53.500 --> 32:56.389
and take off for Venezuela
shortly thereafter.

32:56.440 --> 33:00.103
I'll wager he'll be
taking on a passenger.

33:06.510 --> 33:08.978
GREGSON:
4:22 on the nose.

33:19.660 --> 33:21.491
HOLMES:
The driver.

33:21.530 --> 33:23.748
Kleinfelter's
the driver.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.165
We want the driver!

33:25.200 --> 33:26.394
Move in.

33:27.730 --> 33:29.732
(siren wails)

33:37.140 --> 33:38.778
GREGSON:
Ezra Kleinfelter.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.300
You're under arrest.

33:40.350 --> 33:42.443
You're facing federal charges,

33:42.480 --> 33:44.289
and you're a person of suspicion

33:44.320 --> 33:46.117
in the murder of Vanessa Hiskie.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.459
You people are persistent,
I'll give you that.

33:48.490 --> 33:50.378
_But I'm _still
getting on this plane,

33:50.420 --> 33:51.580
and I'm flying
to Caracas.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.382
(chuckles)
I can tell you two things

33:53.430 --> 33:54.692
wrong with
that sentence.

33:54.730 --> 33:57.119
Arrest me, and 14
innocent men and women

33:57.160 --> 33:58.320
will lose their lives.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.792
One of you,
reach into my bag there.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.694
There's an envelope.

34:14.650 --> 34:16.777
It's a dossier

34:16.820 --> 34:18.845
concerning a man
named Farouq Hassad.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.243
Yeah?

34:20.290 --> 34:21.780
What about him?

34:21.820 --> 34:24.687
He's an intelligence asset
of ours in Morocco.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.686
Call that phone number
on the Post-It.

34:26.730 --> 34:30.154
See how fast the section chief
asks how you kneW that.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.690
That's just one to prove
that I'm not bluffing.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.288
There are 13 more,

34:33.330 --> 34:35.298
and if you arrest me,
their names go public.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.796
Now...

34:36.840 --> 34:38.808
some of them might get
to protection in time.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.502
But most of them?

34:41.540 --> 34:45.146
Well, there's a reason
why they call it "deep cover."

34:51.450 --> 34:52.644
We gotta let him go.

34:54.590 --> 34:55.784
Let him go.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.665
It doesn't matter Where you go.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.224
We know you killed
Vanessa Hiskie.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.498
We'll prove it.

35:29.290 --> 35:30.450
WATSON:
If there's evidence

35:30.490 --> 35:32.287
that ties Ezra to the murder,

35:32.330 --> 35:34.298
do you think that Venezuela
will still grant him asylum?

35:34.330 --> 35:35.729
Why?

35:35.760 --> 35:36.749
Um...

35:36.800 --> 35:38.620
Well, I stole his watch.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.435
You...

35:43.470 --> 35:44.630
That's why
you grabbed him?

35:46.370 --> 35:48.304
We-we didn't cover
sleight of hand yet.

35:48.340 --> 35:49.876
Well, I dug into
it on my own.

35:49.910 --> 35:51.241
You were right.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.645
I mean, all it is
is eye contact

35:52.680 --> 35:54.773
and controlling
the point of focus.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.242
Our power's out,

35:56.280 --> 35:57.770
so What else am I
gonna do but read?

35:57.820 --> 36:00.618
Well, if we can scrape together
enough skin cells

36:00.650 --> 36:02.709
to get a viable
epithelial DNA sample,

36:02.760 --> 36:04.921
and we get creative
about how we came into

36:04.960 --> 36:06.780
possession of
the watch, then...

36:06.830 --> 36:08.422
we can prove
he killed Vanessa Hiskie.

36:08.460 --> 36:12.521
Okay, but even if we do
get Kleinfelter back,

36:12.570 --> 36:13.798
isn't he just gonna
release those names?

36:13.830 --> 36:15.263
Oh, undoubtedly.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.336
But, uh... we just have
to try and make sure

36:17.370 --> 36:19.759
that all 14 of those people
are safe before he does.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.505
Yeah, but we don't
know Who they are.

36:21.540 --> 36:22.768
Not yet.

36:22.810 --> 36:25.449
But it's a nine-hour
flight to Caracas.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.742
I need a backgammon board.

36:26.780 --> 36:28.816
Time to give our client
a status update.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.628
HOLMES:
Good evening,
Elliot Honeycutt.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.524
Holmes.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.561
How did you
get in here?

36:49.740 --> 36:51.469
Have a seat.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.364
We can sharpen your
backgammon skills while we talk.

37:06.550 --> 37:10.418
Things are going rather poorly,
I'm afraid.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.826
Ezra Kleinfelter, as we speak,

37:12.860 --> 37:15.249
is on his way to Venezuela.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.360
It seems he will
escape justice...

37:18.400 --> 37:22.336
and whatever fate
you had in mind for him.

37:23.940 --> 37:26.534
We can tie him to
the murder of Vanessa Hiskie,

37:26.570 --> 37:28.299
but if we do,

37:28.340 --> 37:31.798
he Will release the contents
of several stolen files.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.841
They contain
the names

37:33.880 --> 37:36.678
of 14 clandestine
operatives.

37:39.690 --> 37:40.839
That's not really
surprising

37:40.890 --> 37:42.915
to you, though, is it?

37:42.960 --> 37:44.780
Did you tell
your employers

37:44.830 --> 37:45.979
that he has
the names

37:46.030 --> 37:48.351
of more than a dozen key assets?

37:50.700 --> 37:52.588
No.

37:52.630 --> 37:55.793
The board decided
to pursue a strategy

37:55.840 --> 37:57.330
of containment.

37:57.370 --> 37:58.860
Didn't work,
though, did it?

37:58.910 --> 38:01.629
But now you have a choice.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.342
Release those names
to the government,

38:05.380 --> 38:07.371
and they can get
those people to safety

38:07.410 --> 38:09.617
before Kleinfelter
posts their identities.

38:09.650 --> 38:12.346
That's suicide
for the company.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.539
The board will
never agree.

38:13.590 --> 38:15.285
I'm not talking about the board.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.524
Can you access the stolen files?

38:22.060 --> 38:24.767
I can access anything
at this company.

38:24.800 --> 38:28.691
You're a former operative
yourself.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.038
Does it sit well with you?

38:31.070 --> 38:33.038
Your board playing
fast and loose

38:33.070 --> 38:34.674
with the lives of people
in service?

38:34.710 --> 38:37.031
I have_
no intention

38:37.080 --> 38:39.708
of letting Ezra Kleinfelter

38:39.750 --> 38:42.548
get away With murder.

38:42.580 --> 38:45.583
You've done your research on me.

38:45.620 --> 38:47.508
You know I get my man.

38:47.550 --> 38:50.849
_ Even if it means _
letting those operatives die?

38:50.890 --> 38:54.519
I don't believe
it will mean that.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.653
'Cause when I leave here,

38:56.700 --> 38:59.794
you're going to release
those names to the government,

38:59.830 --> 39:02.094
regardless of What it means
to this company.

39:03.470 --> 39:05.131
Why would I do that?

39:05.170 --> 39:07.900
Because you know
what it means to serve.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.498
You won't leave

39:09.540 --> 39:11.747
those men and women
to their fates.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.671
You're bluffing.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.681
Well, I've told you
what needs to happen.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.980
Those souls won't be
on my conSCIence.

39:28.030 --> 39:29.895
Your turn, Mr. Honeycutt.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.662
REPORTER:
This was the scene

39:33.700 --> 39:35.588
at Miami International Airport,
as federal agents

39:35.640 --> 39:38.507
_ took Ezra Klein_felter _
into custody early this morning.

39:38.540 --> 39:41.634
Federal sources say
that Kleinfelter confessed

39:41.680 --> 39:43.079
to the murder of Vanessa Hiskie

39:43.110 --> 39:45.078
in exchange for a guarantee
that he won't

39:45.110 --> 39:48.147
face capital punishment
for espionage.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.772
Hmm. The power's on.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.038
So you got
confirmation

39:52.090 --> 39:54.115
that the agents
are all okay?

39:54.150 --> 39:56.015
After Honeycutt
turned over the names,

39:56.060 --> 39:59.848
they were in safe houses
within the hour, apparently.

39:59.890 --> 40:01.187
Kleinfelter's
confessmn

40:01.230 --> 40:03.152
has dampened Everyone's
enthusiasm for him.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.691
They've moved on
to other pursuits.

40:05.730 --> 40:07.027
I might have sent them
a photograph

40:07.070 --> 40:08.560
of myself with
a shoe on my head

40:08.600 --> 40:10.033
to hasten
the reconciliation.

40:10.070 --> 40:11.435
(phone dings)

40:11.470 --> 40:12.630
Oh.

40:12.670 --> 40:14.706
My phone's back on.

40:14.740 --> 40:17.004
We are free_
to resume our lives.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.644
You might want to check
all your voice mails.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.977
The landline as well.

40:20.010 --> 40:21.648
Potential clients
may have reached out.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.739
No more detective
work for me today.

40:23.780 --> 40:25.042
I need to figure out

40:25.090 --> 40:27.081
how many people Everyone
managed to offend

40:27.120 --> 40:29.008
when they hacked
into my accounts.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.051
Have you considered
letting the matter lie?

40:31.090 --> 40:32.978
Might be a chance
to pare back on

40:33.030 --> 40:34.691
unnecessary social
entanglements.

40:36.230 --> 40:38.494
And I'm going out tonight.

40:38.530 --> 40:40.964
I need a little
"real world" time.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.935
(sighs)

40:47.970 --> 40:50.768
HOLMES:
"For a long While now,

40:50.810 --> 40:53.699
"I've suspected that connection
with another person,

40:53.750 --> 40:55.115
"real connection,

40:55.150 --> 40:57.914
"simply isn't possible.

40:57.950 --> 41:00.839
"I'm curious if you disagree,

41:00.890 --> 41:04.519
"although I suspect
you feel as I do in this,

41:04.560 --> 41:07.552
as you do in
so many other things..."

41:12.670 --> 41:13.898
Oh, hey.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.898
I'm assuming
the evening went well,

41:15.940 --> 41:18.192
or you wouldn't have ended it
with a good-night kiss.

41:21.070 --> 41:22.799
It wasn't bad.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.808
I mean, I don't know
if there were any sparks.

41:24.850 --> 41:25.999
It was fun.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.113
I think it's sad
that you've given up.

41:34.290 --> 41:36.485
I think you have a lot to share,
if you cared to.

41:38.990 --> 41:41.595
I shouldn't be the only one
who knows you.

41:44.160 --> 41:47.266
*

41:49.970 --> 41:52.837
HOLMES:
"So tell me:

41:52.870 --> 41:55.236
"Is it possible to truly know
another person?

42:00.980 --> 42:03.710
"Is it even
a worthwhile pursuit?

42:11.790 --> 42:15.248
HOLMES and WOMAN:
"Yours is the only opinion
I'll trust,

42:15.300 --> 42:17.791
"the only point of view

42:17.830 --> 42:21.698
"that holds even
the faintest interest.

42:21.740 --> 42:25.562
"I find my diversions,
as I always do,

42:25.610 --> 42:29.569
"but the days are long
in this gray place.

42:29.610 --> 42:33.671
WOMAN:
"I clearly hope
you'll write soon.

42:33.710 --> 42:35.871
"Ever yours,

42:35.920 --> 42:37.911
Jamie Moriarty."
