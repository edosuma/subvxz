[foreboding music playing]

00:24.608 --> 00:26.819
[shallow breathing]

00:35.911 --> 00:37.078
[Owain, muffled]
Arthur...

00:38.622 --> 00:39.582
[in normal voice] Arthur...

00:41.333 --> 00:43.084
The Saxons are regrouping.

00:43.169 --> 00:44.295
We need to go.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.007
We need to take him home
to your father.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.635
Now, Arthur.

00:53.179 --> 00:54.179
Come on!

00:59.852 --> 01:01.145
We need to retreat.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.608
[effort grunting]

01:08.861 --> 01:10.237
-[man] Now.
-[all grunting]

01:18.579 --> 01:19.705
[Owain] Steady.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.144
[horse whinnies]

01:59.620 --> 02:01.539
[dramatic music playing]

02:11.340 --> 02:13.634

02:16.762 --> 02:18.389

02:19.598 --> 02:21.267

[fire crackling]

03:15.111 --> 03:16.947
[horse whinnies]

03:31.295 --> 03:32.254
Take him down.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.548
Gently.

03:34.632 --> 03:35.674
[horse nickering]

03:36.717 --> 03:38.260
[Owain] Hey, hey,
wait, wait, wait.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.682
Listen...

03:45.225 --> 03:46.185
Arthur.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.314
We need to talk.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.823
Look, perhaps, er...

04:01.325 --> 04:03.619
Perhaps it'd be better
if the rest of us...

04:03.702 --> 04:05.162
You know, why don't you let us?

04:09.208 --> 04:10.250
Hey.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.837
Hey, listen to me.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.298
Arthur, stop!

04:19.927 --> 04:22.805
Let us take the prince
to your father.

04:31.647 --> 04:32.690
I will do it.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.859
[intense music playing]

04:40.322 --> 04:41.824
He won't welcome you for this.

04:55.421 --> 04:56.630
[music ends]

05:11.854 --> 05:14.440
Sorry for the loss
of your son, High-King.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.656
Sorry for the loss
of my brother.

05:22.740 --> 05:23.866
Rise.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.748
[somber music playing]

05:34.710 --> 05:36.003
[Arthur] The prince died a hero,

05:37.463 --> 05:41.967
felling Saxon by the dozen.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.093
You were ambushed?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.846
Yes, Father.

05:45.929 --> 05:46.972
Where?

05:48.390 --> 05:49.850
White Horse Plain.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.102
Who led you there?

05:54.480 --> 05:55.522
Oh...

05:56.690 --> 05:59.818
tell me it wasn't the prince.

06:01.779 --> 06:02.821
Tell me...

06:04.948 --> 06:06.742
that that's not his legacy.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.663
[shouting] Answer me!

06:11.747 --> 06:14.041
If I may, great King,
Arthur held the ground

06:14.124 --> 06:16.043
at the river, had he not
done that, we almost certainly

06:16.126 --> 06:19.129
-would have been overwhelmed...
-One more word.

06:24.968 --> 06:25.928
[huffs]

06:27.888 --> 06:30.182
You think holding your tongue
makes you loyal?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.351
Noble?

06:33.811 --> 06:35.187
Worthy of my blood?

06:37.147 --> 06:39.608
Let us retire, High-King.

06:39.691 --> 06:43.320
[Arthur] The Saxons
outflanked us south and west.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.322
We were forced into open ground.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.412
The plain was our only path.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.706
A land without an heir
is a cursed one,

06:54.790 --> 06:57.960
but you are still young,
my king.

06:58.043 --> 07:01.255
More than able to sire an heir
if the Lord our God wills it.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.008
But the fate of the kingdom...

07:06.051 --> 07:07.636
is only as secure...

07:09.221 --> 07:12.307
...as the guard
that is placed on their child.

07:15.144 --> 07:16.520
And when the time comes...

07:20.774 --> 07:24.361
...Father,
I will lead that guard.

07:35.956 --> 07:36.999
If it pleases you.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.501
[scoffs]

07:42.963 --> 07:44.464
If it pleases me?

07:48.343 --> 07:50.137
You...

07:50.220 --> 07:51.763
You truly are...

07:53.432 --> 07:55.309
my bastard.

07:58.395 --> 08:02.107
You not only failed
in your first task

08:02.191 --> 08:04.902
to protect the prince,
but now you offer yourself up

08:04.985 --> 08:06.320
as a defender of the land?

08:06.403 --> 08:08.155
The protector of the people?

08:15.204 --> 08:18.457
I offer myself as your servant.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.960
You are the son of a whore.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.922
Coveting is all you know.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.840
Coveting, begging and conniving,

08:26.924 --> 08:28.592
just like your mother!

08:34.223 --> 08:36.099
You dishonor her
and yourself.

08:38.727 --> 08:39.728
[impact grunts]

08:44.066 --> 08:45.817
[Uther breathing heavily]

09:01.500 --> 09:03.001
[grunts]

09:22.396 --> 09:24.189
[Uther] Give me your sword.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.204
Father!

09:40.372 --> 09:41.581
Please.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.552
[impact grunts]

09:55.095 --> 09:57.055
[Uther grunts in frustration]

10:02.185 --> 10:04.021
[shouts]

10:04.104 --> 10:09.526
If this pleases me!
If this pleases me!

10:09.609 --> 10:13.030
[panting frantically]

10:13.113 --> 10:15.699
[slow instrumental
music playing]

10:33.717 --> 10:35.218
[groans]

10:46.396 --> 10:47.606
The Saxon...

10:49.733 --> 10:50.901
patient...

10:52.027 --> 10:55.238
ever vigilant,
he caught us sleeping.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.451
He stole across the land like...

10:59.534 --> 11:02.079
Like night itself
and they glutted the ground...

11:03.288 --> 11:04.623
with our blood.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.545
You'd think we'd know by now.
You'd think we'd be ready.

11:13.048 --> 11:16.551
Year upon year they weaken us
like louse in a beam.

11:16.635 --> 11:20.597
And now, the beam is cracking.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.391
It's breaking.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.767
I can...

11:26.603 --> 11:27.938
I can hear it.

11:31.983 --> 11:36.154
And here you all are.

11:36.238 --> 11:40.242
The tribal kings and queens
of this great isle.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.994
Thank you for coming
so far and fast.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.832
Every tribal king,
bar Gorfydd and Gundleus,

11:46.915 --> 11:49.584
but I don't expect miracles.
Gorfydd is too proud

11:49.668 --> 11:51.461
and Gundleus,
like all Silurians,

11:51.545 --> 11:54.172
too drunk on murder
and pillage to be much missed.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.716
Not when I have friends

11:56.800 --> 11:57.968
like this.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.515
Truly, Bishop,

12:03.598 --> 12:05.892
I am blessed.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.982
And I'm a little
surprised... too.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.946
When the Saxon
first darkened our shores,

12:18.029 --> 12:20.740
I, as ruler
and high-king of this isle,

12:20.824 --> 12:22.033
sought your aid.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.162
I begged for it.

12:27.122 --> 12:30.041
Did you answer my call...

12:30.125 --> 12:31.376
King Tewdric?

12:33.336 --> 12:35.922
-No, High-King.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.175
You sat that one out.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.260
You let Dumnonia fight for you.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.137
Die for you!

12:42.220 --> 12:43.722
[chuckles scornfully]

12:46.183 --> 12:48.685
Oh, King Cadwys.
[continues chuckling]

12:49.853 --> 12:52.564
Did you fight
at Dumnonia's side?

12:52.647 --> 12:54.900
-No, my king.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:54.983 --> 12:59.070
Because your daughter
was getting married

12:59.154 --> 13:03.366
and the preparations
were... vexatious?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.118
How can I earn
your forgiveness?

13:07.954 --> 13:10.582
[Uther] None of you are
Dumnonia's friend.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.083
You resent us.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.919
The reach of Dumnonia's realm.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.379
You resent our crops,
our minerals, our men...

13:16.463 --> 13:17.797
You resent us!

13:19.758 --> 13:22.594
You hate us.

13:23.678 --> 13:29.809
But surely, surely,
you hate the Saxon more.

13:31.228 --> 13:34.314
I've felt more fealty
from my dog.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.983
-From my bastard!
-[Arthur groans]

13:39.194 --> 13:40.529
[exhales]

13:43.031 --> 13:46.284
[Uther] And now
you show your faces.

13:46.368 --> 13:49.371
When it's too late
and my son is dead,

13:49.454 --> 13:51.498
and when it matters not.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.419
[continues groaning]

13:58.088 --> 14:01.967
But the next time
I call upon you...

14:02.050 --> 14:03.760
you remember this day.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.972
You remember

14:08.139 --> 14:09.683
your high-king.

14:09.766 --> 14:10.850
[Merlin] Banish him!

14:12.394 --> 14:13.728
[breathing heavily]

14:17.774 --> 14:19.859
From Dumnonia
and all of Britain.

14:21.778 --> 14:25.824
And be warned the fool
who gives him aid or shelter.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.496
You have lost one son today.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.126
The Gods would not
see you lose another.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.046
The Gods, Merlin...

14:41.464 --> 14:42.882
or you?

14:42.966 --> 14:45.343
Let me bear Mordred to Avalon.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.888
There he will be
nearer to the gods

14:48.972 --> 14:50.849
when I convey him
to their care.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.153
[groans]

15:05.947 --> 15:07.490
[Owain] Arthur!
Wait, wait, wait!

15:07.574 --> 15:09.492
-Hold up, hold up, hold up.
-[guard] No, sir.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.244
-You know you can't.
-Give me a minute, please!

15:11.328 --> 15:12.662
Just to say goodbye. Please.

15:12.746 --> 15:13.997
Please.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.252
[effort grunts]

15:20.754 --> 15:22.881
Let me say goodbye
to my friend.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.007
Come.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.138
Dumnonia...

15:30.221 --> 15:32.223
[Owain] Huh?

15:32.307 --> 15:34.809
[breathing heavily]
Dumnonia...

15:34.893 --> 15:36.353
still dominates the isle,

15:36.436 --> 15:38.271
but my father is complacent.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.523
-He is blind.
-Shh, shh, shh.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.694
You will win
my father's ear, Owain.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.530
Make him see
the error of his ways.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.658
Me? I'm not going to be able
to win his ear...

15:49.741 --> 15:52.577
My father ignores
half the Tribe Kings.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.622
He must unite them.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.416
Even Siluria and Powys

15:58.500 --> 16:01.503
cement their support
for the coming war.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.836
[wheezing]

16:04.005 --> 16:05.340
[Owain] I don't understand,
what do you mean?

16:05.422 --> 16:06.966
[guard] Let's go.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.384
-Come on, let's go!
-One minute, please!

16:08.468 --> 16:09.469
One minute!

16:09.552 --> 16:11.388
So help me! One minute!

16:15.975 --> 16:19.228
How exactly are we meant
to defeat the Saxons?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.690
First you contain them,

16:21.773 --> 16:24.484
then you hold
the line... here.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.862
I mean, how are we supposed
to defeat the Saxons

16:27.946 --> 16:29.739
without you?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.825
[shallow breathing]

16:34.577 --> 16:35.912
Hmm?

16:38.540 --> 16:40.458
If one Saxon sets foot
west of Calleva,

16:40.542 --> 16:41.710
then we are doomed.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.503
Dumnonia and all the tribes.

16:46.548 --> 16:49.092
[guard] Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.677
Calleva.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.062
Calleva.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.571

17:34.304 --> 17:35.805
[horse whinnying]

17:36.931 --> 17:38.349
Who's here?

17:38.433 --> 17:39.476
Anyone?

[child groaning]

19:33.965 --> 19:35.425
[continues groaning]

19:35.508 --> 19:36.551
[Arthur] Hold on. I'm coming.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.178
Stay still, stay still.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.813
[continues groaning]

19:48.897 --> 19:50.440
This won't hurt.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.816
You're going to make it.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.067
You are a warrior.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.362
On the count of three.

19:58.406 --> 19:59.365
One...

20:00.450 --> 20:01.951
-[grunts]
-[flesh squelching]

20:02.035 --> 20:03.953

20:22.388 --> 20:24.307
[shallow breathing]

20:49.999 --> 20:51.459
[indistinct chatter]

20:54.253 --> 20:55.213
[Arthur] Merlin!

21:00.593 --> 21:01.719
Merlin!

21:06.349 --> 21:07.767
Merlin!

21:15.441 --> 21:17.944
Think I was joking
when I told him to banish you?

21:19.070 --> 21:20.113
[Arthur groans in pain]

21:21.531 --> 21:22.615
Thank you, Hywel.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.369
Okay.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.037
[effort grunts]

21:31.332 --> 21:34.669
His wounds are deep, Merlin.

21:34.752 --> 21:37.088
So what possessed you
to bring him here?

21:37.171 --> 21:38.673
[Arthur] He's dying.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.427
You told me once...

21:44.470 --> 21:47.598
"Avalon is home
to those who do not fit

21:47.682 --> 21:49.559
and have no wish to belong."

21:56.065 --> 21:57.275
[boy moaning]

21:59.652 --> 22:01.029
His wounds.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.948
[Merlin] What do you
see in him, Nimue?

22:05.575 --> 22:06.826
The stakes of a death pit.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.662
The only survivor

22:09.746 --> 22:11.706
of a raid to the north.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.416
Where to the north?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.877
[Arthur] Fishing village
near the border.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.546
[scoffs] Silurians.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.631
We saved the isle
from the Saxon

22:20.715 --> 22:22.884
and they thank us
with endless raids and plunder.

22:28.389 --> 22:29.640
[boy moaning]

22:33.936 --> 22:36.856
[boy screaming]

22:45.198 --> 22:47.492
Hywel, take him inside.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.708
[continues moaning]

22:59.170 --> 23:00.171
Nimue...

23:02.965 --> 23:04.217
...look after him.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.309
[animal sounds]

23:13.392 --> 23:16.104
[Merlin] Well, your timing
was reliably terrible.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.355
[sighs]

23:18.564 --> 23:20.817
What was I supposed to do?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.902
In grief and guilt,
he lashed out.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.612
You gave him a target.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.531
Guilt?

23:26.614 --> 23:28.574
Sending Mordred
to quell a border skirmish

23:28.658 --> 23:30.618
would be foolish enough.
Sending him to fight

23:30.701 --> 23:32.537
-the Saxons in open battle...
-Don't speak ill of my brother.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.080
-He spoke ill of you often...
-Merlin...

23:34.163 --> 23:36.582
...and he had
none of your gifts.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.459
Not even the quick mouth.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.462
You see what must be done,

23:41.546 --> 23:43.714
today, tomorrow.

23:43.798 --> 23:46.592
You make others
feel slow, sluggish.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.639
Nothing fosters enemies
like envy.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.599
Banishment
will suit you, Arthur.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.727
Shape you.

23:56.811 --> 23:59.564
Mold you into the man
the gods would have you be.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.191
Don't squander it.

24:03.693 --> 24:04.735
Embrace it.

24:06.571 --> 24:08.364
Come.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.866
Banishment's not
to be undertaken

24:09.949 --> 24:11.617
on an empty stomach.

24:11.701 --> 24:14.328
I need to take care
of your wounds.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.038
I must leave Dumnonia.

24:18.374 --> 24:19.417
Today.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.088
No one will begrudge you
one last meal.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.715
Ointment on those bruises.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.094
My king has commanded it.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.434
[Merlin] Very well.

24:36.517 --> 24:39.395
-Try not to get yourself killed.
-[Arthur scoffs]

24:39.478 --> 24:42.148
When you offer counsel
of that caliber,

24:42.231 --> 24:43.441
I listen.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.067
[snickers]

24:45.151 --> 24:46.819
[Arthur] Steady.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.237
[effort grunts]

24:51.365 --> 24:52.700
Merlin...

24:55.745 --> 24:56.996
...nurture him...

24:57.997 --> 24:59.290
as you did me.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.835
Until I see you again.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.048
Come.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.636
[dramatic music rises]

25:21.187 --> 25:23.439
Muder. Muder.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.026
He's Saxon.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.656
[boy groans]

25:31.739 --> 25:33.824
[Nimue] But he's from
one of our settlements.

25:33.908 --> 25:35.701
[Hywel] So he must be a slave.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.412
Him and his mother,
wherever she may be.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.249
Your mother's gone.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.751
Our tongue will be your tongue.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.086
We'll call you Derfel.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.756
It means strong.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.729
Will he live?

26:30.965 --> 26:31.924
[both laughing]

26:43.728 --> 26:47.189
Do you think
Arthur might come this year?

26:48.357 --> 26:50.192
They say he's gone
as far as Gaul.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.113
And his punishment still stands.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.492
You're bound together
wherever Arthur may be.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.372
Merlin says there'll be
betrothals tonight.

27:04.498 --> 27:06.208
-Ralla and Culwyn.
-Hmm.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.338
-I pity her.
-Hmm?

27:10.421 --> 27:14.425
He has a body of a dumpling
and the mind of a child.

27:14.508 --> 27:16.385
She has a brain.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.013
So he will love
and cherish her

27:19.096 --> 27:22.183
and... she can make
all the decisions.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.392
[indistinct chattering]

27:23.476 --> 27:24.643
[horse neighing]

27:26.520 --> 27:28.564
-[Derfel] What's that?
-[Nimue] Merchants and hawkers

27:28.647 --> 27:30.107
coming for the festival.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.613
[children laughing]

27:41.369 --> 27:42.828
[Derfel and Nimue laughing]

27:49.710 --> 27:50.669
[Morgan] Nimue.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.506
[Nimue] Lady Morgan.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.591
Merlin is waiting.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.259
There are preparations
for tonight.

28:08.729 --> 28:11.899
[Derfel] My lady,
you're here for the festival?

28:14.568 --> 28:17.405
There are other girls
in Avalon, Derfel.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.366
Girls who can be truly yours.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.728
[Hywel] Derfel.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.063
Got a minute?

28:54.984 --> 28:56.068
Which?

28:56.152 --> 28:57.945
That one.

28:58.028 --> 28:59.780
Oh.

28:59.864 --> 29:01.657
[chuckles]

29:01.740 --> 29:03.909
Almost time to hoist the bull.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.995
You make it sound
so much fun, Father.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.080
[chuckles] And so easy.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.332
I'm not doing it this year.
I'm not.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.209
Hmm, you said that last year.

29:14.879 --> 29:16.589
Is this what you're wearing?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.800
Ah, I'll fetch you something.

29:23.387 --> 29:24.430
You wanted to speak to me?

29:27.558 --> 29:28.517
[Morgan] Be careful.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.810
Steady now.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.398
Careful.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.820
[Hywel] When Lady Morgan visits,
she gets everyone working.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.657
Derfel, I want
to ask you something.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.621
I have no son.

29:48.704 --> 29:49.663
No heir.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.542
I'm not getting any younger.

29:56.879 --> 30:00.090
What would you feel about,
er, taking on the farm?

30:00.174 --> 30:02.176
One day?

30:02.259 --> 30:05.012
Hywel, I'm not sure yet

30:05.095 --> 30:06.388
what my path is.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.517
You'd need some time
to think about it.

30:12.603 --> 30:15.314
All I ask is
you don't throw me out.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.401
No.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.696
How about a stint manning
the vats and dyeing some wool?

30:22.780 --> 30:24.949
I did that at your age.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.201
With all respect to Merlin,

30:27.284 --> 30:29.745
that's where Avalon's heart
truly beats.

30:31.121 --> 30:32.831
[dramatic music playing]

30:49.515 --> 30:51.725
[Merlin] On my travels,
people ask me,

30:53.811 --> 30:55.145
"What is Avalon?"

30:57.731 --> 30:59.650
We are not richer,

30:59.733 --> 31:00.651
mightier...

31:02.278 --> 31:03.487
cleverer.

31:04.780 --> 31:08.117
We are merely closer
to the gods.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.535
[WOMAN] Yes.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.537
The heavens!

31:11.620 --> 31:12.580
The Fates!

31:13.831 --> 31:15.207
To the life beyond.

31:16.917 --> 31:19.628
In that we are blessed.
[chuckles]

31:19.712 --> 31:21.755
[crowd cheering and applauding]

31:38.939 --> 31:41.859
[folk music playing]

32:07.509 --> 32:09.094
[music ends]

32:21.982 --> 32:24.401
[crowd cheering and applauding]

32:28.030 --> 32:29.740
Whoo!

32:40.501 --> 32:43.045
-[drums beating]
-[indistinct chatter]

32:44.338 --> 32:47.216
[Culwyn]
Come on, Ralla. Come on.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.717
Come on. It's our wedding day.

32:54.348 --> 32:55.683
[Nimue] Mmm.

33:08.112 --> 33:10.197
[Derfel] Next solstice
we should bind hands.

33:11.657 --> 33:12.616
Nimue...

33:22.543 --> 33:24.086
[low growling]

33:31.468 --> 33:33.429
[gasps]

33:33.512 --> 33:35.389
[Derfel] What, Nimue?

33:35.472 --> 33:36.765
-Nimue?
-[breathing heavily]

33:36.849 --> 33:37.974
[muffled barks]

33:42.688 --> 33:44.231
[Derfel] What?
What can you see?

33:45.023 --> 33:46.108
Tell me, Nimue.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.570
-[exhales]
-[continues barking]

33:49.653 --> 33:51.195
[howling]

33:51.280 --> 33:53.157
[foreboding music playing]

33:57.619 --> 33:59.747
[wolf barking in distance]

33:59.830 --> 34:01.457
[breathing heavily]

34:04.334 --> 34:05.335
[Nimue] Can you see?

34:06.462 --> 34:07.880
What is it? What is it?

34:07.963 --> 34:08.964
The Gods...

34:10.382 --> 34:12.468
they want me to choose.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.219
Choose between you or them.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.305
[Merlin] Yes.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.307
And they won't wait
for an answer.

34:19.767 --> 34:21.059
Away!

34:27.399 --> 34:29.401
Nimue, listen to me
very carefully.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.031
In time, you will be
the most powerful druid

34:34.114 --> 34:36.200
Dumnonia has ever known.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.201
That is certain.

34:38.243 --> 34:41.288
And with Britain so divided,

34:41.371 --> 34:43.832
you will be needed
in the dark times ahead.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.961
But the road there
will be hard.

34:49.213 --> 34:50.172
Long.

34:51.131 --> 34:52.966
Lonely.

34:53.050 --> 34:55.010
Your gift is sacred
to the gods.

34:56.470 --> 34:59.556
Your life must be
a solitary one, without...

35:00.891 --> 35:04.061
union and without child, or...

35:05.896 --> 35:07.231
Or you will lose your gifts.

35:07.314 --> 35:08.357
[sniffles]

35:11.735 --> 35:13.070
What if I refuse?

35:14.696 --> 35:16.657
Then the gods
won't speak to you again.

35:18.992 --> 35:19.952
Ever.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.873
[inhales deeply]

35:31.088 --> 35:32.256
Derfel...

35:34.091 --> 35:35.634
How can I deny who I am?

35:38.095 --> 35:39.721
How can I deny my path?

35:43.433 --> 35:45.310
[indistinct chattering]

35:48.897 --> 35:50.524
[tapping]

36:05.581 --> 36:07.708
This mark of Siluria,

36:07.791 --> 36:09.126
why do you wear it?

36:11.920 --> 36:14.047
I was their slave.

36:14.131 --> 36:17.134
[Young Derfel] Muder! Muder!

36:17.217 --> 36:18.427
[whooping]

36:18.510 --> 36:20.470
-No, Muder!
-I'm coming, son!

36:20.554 --> 36:22.764
[grunting] Muder!

36:22.848 --> 36:25.851
-[Derfel's mother shrieks]
-[whooping]

36:25.934 --> 36:28.186
[pensive music playing]

36:49.458 --> 36:50.792
[fire blazing]

36:55.130 --> 36:56.632
[Derfel's mother shouting]

36:56.715 --> 36:58.133
[pensive music playing]

36:58.216 --> 36:59.343
[Young Derfel shouting]

37:01.637 --> 37:03.847
[grunting]

37:03.931 --> 37:05.849
[Lunete] Derfel?

37:05.933 --> 37:07.142
Are you drunk?

37:07.225 --> 37:08.352
[Derfel grunts]

37:08.435 --> 37:09.937
[breathing unsteadily]

37:11.313 --> 37:12.940
I just want to be alone.

37:15.776 --> 37:17.110
[intense music playing]

37:17.194 --> 37:18.320
[effort grunts]

37:20.781 --> 37:23.200
Come on. Come on.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.618
Come on!

37:28.413 --> 37:30.290
[music intensifies]

37:33.460 --> 37:34.586
[Derfel's mother screaming]

37:42.010 --> 37:43.845
[horse neighing]

37:55.941 --> 37:57.484
[horse nickers]

38:05.117 --> 38:06.743
[Arthur] Hold on.
I'm coming.

38:06.827 --> 38:08.453
[horse neighing]

38:11.456 --> 38:12.749
I'm coming.

38:16.712 --> 38:19.131
Stay still, stay still.
You're safe now.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.716
You're safe now.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.468
You're going to make it.

38:25.387 --> 38:26.471
You're a fighter.

38:28.015 --> 38:29.182
You're a warrior.

38:31.184 --> 38:32.310
-[screams]
-[flesh squelching]

38:32.394 --> 38:33.603
[coughs]

38:44.614 --> 38:45.991
You're a warrior.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.664
[birds chirping]

38:57.169 --> 38:58.920
[pensive music playing]

39:07.929 --> 39:08.930
[Nimue] Derfel?

39:11.516 --> 39:13.810
Where have you been?

39:13.894 --> 39:15.312
Why did you rush off?

39:16.521 --> 39:17.731
[Derfel] It doesn't matter.

39:19.566 --> 39:20.525
I'm sorry.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.905
-What's going on?
-Queen Norwenna is in labor.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.239
You'll ride with us, Derfel.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.325
We could do with the extra help.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.216
[screams]

39:45.217 --> 39:46.885
[monk praying]

39:48.512 --> 39:50.806
[Merlin] Morgan, take the cross
from Queen Norwenna.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.475
Get out! Get out!

39:53.558 --> 39:55.393
-[Norwenna grunts]
-[Merlin] Go!

39:55.477 --> 39:57.979
[Norwenna] How dare you!
Leave him be!

39:58.063 --> 39:59.356
-Give it to me.
-[grunting]

39:59.439 --> 40:01.024
[Morgan] Give it to me!

40:01.108 --> 40:02.651
[Norwenna shrieks]

40:02.734 --> 40:04.444
The fires, Derfel.
Help them set the fires.

40:04.528 --> 40:05.654
Yes.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.030
[Norwenna continues screaming]

40:10.951 --> 40:13.662
-Hold her.
-[Norwenna groaning in pain]

40:15.163 --> 40:17.124
[screaming]

40:20.252 --> 40:22.420
-[straining]
-[baby crying]

40:22.504 --> 40:23.964
[crying]

40:31.763 --> 40:34.432
[baby crying]

40:47.571 --> 40:50.073
[foreboding music playing]

41:03.837 --> 41:05.630
[woman screaming]

41:11.094 --> 41:12.345
[gasps]

41:24.566 --> 41:25.609
[indistinct chattering]

41:25.692 --> 41:26.985
[bell tolling]

41:32.949 --> 41:34.409
-[dog barking]
-[man] Let's go.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.623
Can I help?

41:39.706 --> 41:41.082
Yes. Grab some logs.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.337
[bell continues tolling]

41:46.796 --> 41:48.924
[Derfel] What are you doing?

41:49.007 --> 41:50.383
[guard] When Caer Cadarn
lights its fires,

41:50.467 --> 41:52.052
all Britain takes heed.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.806
[bell continues tolling]

41:58.225 --> 41:59.601
[guard] Come on.
There's more to do.

42:13.490 --> 42:14.616
Is it a boy?

42:17.786 --> 42:18.745
It is.

42:40.267 --> 42:41.393
But he's crippled.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.189
His foot twisted.

42:46.273 --> 42:47.274
He will never run.

42:48.441 --> 42:50.902
Well, kings don't run, Merlin.

42:50.986 --> 42:52.946
They walk. They ride.

42:55.532 --> 42:57.284
-They rule.
-It's not his foot

42:57.367 --> 42:58.618
that concerns me.

43:00.161 --> 43:01.288
It's his nature.

43:02.330 --> 43:04.582
There is evil in him.

43:04.666 --> 43:07.377
It will grow and fester
with every passing year.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.796
He will bring death
and ruin to the kingdom,

43:09.879 --> 43:11.673
and the Saxon
will take the isle.

43:16.136 --> 43:17.595
When I held him,

43:18.805 --> 43:21.349
I saw a man
who butchers his own people.

43:22.726 --> 43:25.145
I saw the end of Dumnonia

43:25.228 --> 43:27.272
and the whole of Britain.

43:27.355 --> 43:28.940
[Bedwin] My high-king.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.253
[baby cooing]

43:52.547 --> 43:54.299
He has my father's eyes.

44:00.347 --> 44:01.306
The poison...

44:02.807 --> 44:04.934
isn't in the child, Merlin.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.563
It's in you.

44:08.646 --> 44:09.939
You have another son.

44:11.399 --> 44:13.943
A bastard, yes, but a man
other men will follow.

44:14.027 --> 44:15.445
You dare mention his name?

44:15.528 --> 44:17.697
Seek Arthur out.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.617
The isle has known
nothing but peril

44:20.700 --> 44:22.035
since you banished him.

44:23.870 --> 44:26.873
Seek him out
and beg his forgiveness.

44:29.501 --> 44:30.710
[Uther] No.

44:30.794 --> 44:32.295
You will take the newborn

44:32.379 --> 44:33.546
to your Avalon.

44:34.839 --> 44:36.966
He is different after all.
He is special.

44:38.051 --> 44:40.470
He'll thrive there
and be out of harm's way.

44:42.514 --> 44:45.183
And you will
see to it personally.

44:47.769 --> 44:51.231
If you're too proud to send
for Arthur, I'll go myself.

44:51.314 --> 44:53.066
You walk away now...

44:54.401 --> 44:56.194
and you're never coming back.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.157
So be it.

45:02.784 --> 45:04.369
Someone must bring Arthur home.

45:06.162 --> 45:07.997
[intense music playing]

45:12.252 --> 45:14.421
Far and wide...

45:14.504 --> 45:16.297
spread the word.

45:17.549 --> 45:19.384
Dumnonia,

45:19.467 --> 45:22.137
the Kingdom of Kingdoms,
has a new heir.

45:27.308 --> 45:28.643
Prince Mordred.

45:30.061 --> 45:33.356
[Nimue] Merlin!
Merlin, what did you see?

45:34.732 --> 45:36.443
What did you see?

45:36.526 --> 45:37.694
[Merlin sighs]

45:37.777 --> 45:40.655
I saw fire, slaughter, ruin.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.449
A land enslaved by a tyrant.

45:43.575 --> 45:45.577
I saw the death of Britain.

45:45.660 --> 45:48.288
That child will do
the Saxons' bidding.

45:48.371 --> 45:49.747
Only Arthur can stop him.

45:49.831 --> 45:50.957
I should have brought him
home sooner.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.625
Why? Why, Arthur?

45:52.709 --> 45:54.419
He is of the blood.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.629
A true Pendragon.
He alone has the vision,

45:56.713 --> 45:58.256
the authority
to bind the tribes

45:58.339 --> 46:00.717
and vanquish our foes.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.302
You must take my place, Nimue.

46:02.385 --> 46:04.929
Protect the pagan,
thwart the Christian

46:05.013 --> 46:06.764
and defend Avalon
at all costs.

46:08.057 --> 46:10.435
But I'm not ready,
nowhere near.

46:12.145 --> 46:15.690
Fate has forced our hand
but you are more than ready.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.026
You will speak to
and for the gods.

46:18.109 --> 46:20.278
Be their vessel
and their voice.

46:20.361 --> 46:23.406
But the price of this power
is your solitude.

46:23.490 --> 46:25.408
Remember that.

46:25.492 --> 46:26.659
Merlin...

46:36.503 --> 46:38.213
[music rises]

46:41.633 --> 46:43.801
[indistinct chattering]

46:43.885 --> 46:45.261
[baby crying]

47:01.027 --> 47:02.987
[Nimue] The prince
and Queen Norwenna.

47:03.071 --> 47:05.240
-Thank you.
-Uther's sending them to Avalon.

47:07.367 --> 47:10.119
But what's Avalon
without Merlin?

47:10.203 --> 47:11.746
Has he really gone for Arthur?

47:11.829 --> 47:13.164
What Merlin says
and what he does

47:13.248 --> 47:15.083
are not always the same.

47:15.166 --> 47:16.543
But he has gone.

47:17.877 --> 47:19.003
Leaving now,

47:19.087 --> 47:20.338
if you please.

47:21.756 --> 47:23.675
Ligessac, head of
the King's Guard.

47:25.260 --> 47:27.345
They'll be watching over
the prince and the queen.

47:29.556 --> 47:31.224
Hey.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.393
I, er...

47:33.476 --> 47:34.602
I can't go.

47:36.062 --> 47:38.147
I found work here.

47:38.231 --> 47:39.691
Doing what?

47:41.609 --> 47:43.069
Tending the horses.

47:43.152 --> 47:44.195
[Nimue] Really?

47:46.990 --> 47:49.450
How did you get
this position anyway?

47:49.534 --> 47:51.703
You don't know anyone here.

47:51.786 --> 47:52.829
I'm going to stay here.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.456
Learn to fight.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.125
Become a warrior like Arthur.

47:58.209 --> 48:00.211
-Why?
-[Morgan] Nimue,

48:00.295 --> 48:02.297
-We need to go.
-[baby crying]

48:02.380 --> 48:03.673
[horse nickers]

48:06.718 --> 48:09.721
Well, when your work
brings you to Avalon,

48:09.804 --> 48:11.180
I expect a visit.

48:14.601 --> 48:15.643
Derfel.

48:24.777 --> 48:25.737
[sighs]

48:48.259 --> 48:50.094
-[dramatic music playing]
-[laughter]

48:53.139 --> 48:55.308
[indistinct chattering]

48:55.391 --> 48:57.060
[man] Come on!

49:04.984 --> 49:06.569
[exhaling]

49:30.343 --> 49:31.719
[sword rasping]

49:36.724 --> 49:39.102
[music intensifies]

49:49.237 --> 49:52.407
[grunting loudly]

49:59.288 --> 50:01.249
[screams]

50:02.792 --> 50:04.460
[music intensifies]

50:06.379 --> 50:07.672
-[music ends]
-[swords clanging]

50:10.550 --> 50:11.884
[Derfel exclaims in horror]

50:13.052 --> 50:14.637
[grunts]

50:20.643 --> 50:22.729
You know, there are
very strict rules about who can

50:22.812 --> 50:24.397
and can't come in here.
Do you know that?

50:26.941 --> 50:28.609
[scoffs]

50:28.693 --> 50:29.652
Just kidding.

50:32.280 --> 50:35.074
Go on then. Tell me.
How many times?

50:35.158 --> 50:36.409
Just tonight.

50:38.369 --> 50:42.081
Tonight and every night
for the past two months.

50:42.165 --> 50:45.001
Aye, except last Sunday,
when the bishop said...

50:45.084 --> 50:47.086
-[objects shattering]
-[grunts]

50:52.550 --> 50:54.927
See, your cuts aren't bad,
but you're way too close.

50:55.011 --> 50:56.554
You're never gonna
thrust like that.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.267
Do you know who I am?

51:02.477 --> 51:03.770
You're Lord Owain, sir.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.230
-Arthur's friend.
-That's right.

51:08.316 --> 51:11.277
How about you tend to my horses
every now and again?

51:11.360 --> 51:13.738
Perhaps one day I'll teach you
how to use that thing properly.

51:17.325 --> 51:18.576
Sound good?

51:19.869 --> 51:20.828
Yes, sir.

51:24.040 --> 51:24.999
Go on then.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.756
[intense music playing]

51:36.886 --> 51:38.262
[effort grunting]

51:45.061 --> 51:46.729
Riders!

51:46.813 --> 51:48.272
[horses whinnying]

51:52.485 --> 51:54.028
[guard] State your business.

51:58.449 --> 52:00.034
We're men of God,

52:00.117 --> 52:02.078
come to pay our respects
to the high-king.

52:03.746 --> 52:04.705
Oh, aye?

52:06.958 --> 52:09.460
Well, unless
I'm very much mistaken,

52:09.544 --> 52:11.170
you lot are Silurians.

52:12.505 --> 52:16.467
Well, we bring
only ourselves...

52:17.468 --> 52:19.053
and our good intentions.

52:20.763 --> 52:21.973
That's a yes then.

52:23.766 --> 52:25.434
I'm surprised you lot
dared to come.

52:47.456 --> 52:49.292
King Gundleus of Siluria.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.590
[Morgan]
Can I speak, my high-king?

53:01.596 --> 53:04.432
The rapes,
the raiding parties,

53:04.515 --> 53:07.310
the burned-out villages
and broken pledges...

53:07.393 --> 53:10.730
He and Siluria deserve nothing
but the fiercest retribution.

53:10.813 --> 53:13.399
Let's slit his throat
when we have the chance.

53:13.482 --> 53:15.693
If Arthur deserved
banishment and exile,

53:15.776 --> 53:18.696
then he deserves a fate
100 times worse.

53:18.779 --> 53:20.156
[Uther] Enough.

53:21.157 --> 53:24.368
We keep our enemies close.

53:24.452 --> 53:25.578
Right?

53:31.834 --> 53:32.919
Approach.

53:35.046 --> 53:37.256
[Gundleus] I've come to pledge
my allegiance, High-King.

53:38.424 --> 53:40.384
I come to make peace.

53:40.468 --> 53:41.844
-[Uther] Peace?
-[Gundleus] Hmm.

53:41.928 --> 53:44.096
You have blood on your hands,

53:44.180 --> 53:46.015
the blood of our women
and children.

53:47.183 --> 53:50.436
By the mercy of our Lord...

53:53.356 --> 53:55.441
my hands are clean.

53:55.524 --> 53:57.276
You think Siluria's treachery

53:57.360 --> 53:59.278
can be forgotten
with empty gestures?

54:03.115 --> 54:05.117
-Kill him.
-Blood for blood.

54:06.410 --> 54:07.870
Set me a challenge.

54:07.954 --> 54:10.665
A test worthy of my crimes

54:10.748 --> 54:12.625
and my debt to you.

54:12.708 --> 54:14.085
Anything.

54:19.131 --> 54:20.174
Anything?

54:22.093 --> 54:23.344
Anything.

54:25.638 --> 54:28.557
Your uncle, Gorfydd...

54:28.641 --> 54:30.685
has been plundering
our borders for months.

54:32.478 --> 54:34.647
And you will see to it
that he never does it again.

54:36.399 --> 54:38.317
I will win your trust

54:38.401 --> 54:42.321
as I won the Lord's forgiveness,
by word and deed.

54:42.405 --> 54:46.867
[Uther] Do you think your cross
and conversion interests me,

54:46.951 --> 54:48.119
or convinces me?

54:49.829 --> 54:52.164
It's your brutality I prize.

54:53.582 --> 54:54.625
Your violence...

54:56.502 --> 54:59.130
and your resemblance
to a starving rat.

54:59.213 --> 55:01.382
-[snickers]
-[Uther] Now that's the Gundleus

55:01.465 --> 55:04.176
I'll be sending to Powys.

55:04.260 --> 55:06.512
-Understood?
-Understood.

55:15.980 --> 55:18.858
[Gundleus] You honor me,
and all of Siluria.

55:20.484 --> 55:21.777
More than that...

55:23.529 --> 55:26.282
you humble me with your grace
and forgiveness.

55:35.541 --> 55:37.877
[Uther] Do that, Gundleus,

55:37.960 --> 55:41.297
and Dumnonia will forgive you
all your past sins.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.008
[Derfel's mother] Wulfric!

55:45.009 --> 55:47.136
Wulfric!

55:47.219 --> 55:49.847
[flames roaring]

55:49.930 --> 55:52.183
-[screams]
-Wulfric!

55:53.309 --> 55:55.186
Muder! Muder!

55:55.269 --> 55:57.146
[shrieks]

55:57.229 --> 55:58.481
[screams]

55:58.564 --> 56:01.525
[howls]

56:01.609 --> 56:03.652
[horse neighing]

56:03.736 --> 56:05.654
-[Derfel's mother] Wulfric!
-[screams]

56:07.406 --> 56:08.949
[howling]

56:18.125 --> 56:20.169
[faint chattering]

56:52.159 --> 56:53.410
[Merlin] Where is your lord?

56:54.662 --> 56:55.871
[Sagramor] And who are you?

56:57.540 --> 57:00.292
-[Merlin] An old friend.
-[Sagramor] Come with me.

57:03.629 --> 57:06.507
He took a spear cut
to his cheek today.

57:06.590 --> 57:08.300
He can't see properly
in a helmet.

57:08.384 --> 57:09.844
That's what he says.

57:09.927 --> 57:11.720
If the Frank had thrust
an inch higher...

57:13.055 --> 57:14.306
There's no telling him.

57:15.349 --> 57:16.392
[Merlin] There never was.

57:17.560 --> 57:19.562
Seems you know him well.

57:19.645 --> 57:22.273
We fought together
since he led his first war party

57:22.356 --> 57:24.275
for King Ban.

57:24.358 --> 57:27.611
He kills like no man
I've ever seen.

57:30.072 --> 57:31.907
But he likes to be clean after.

57:32.992 --> 57:34.410
[Merlin chuckles]

58:03.647 --> 58:06.108
-Merlin!
-Arthur.

58:21.665 --> 58:23.626
[Merlin laughs]

58:28.088 --> 58:29.798
It's good to see you, Arthur.

58:33.260 --> 58:34.637
You too, my friend.

58:37.014 --> 58:38.390
Come home, Arthur.

58:40.351 --> 58:42.228
Only you can save the isle.

58:43.312 --> 58:44.521
Come home.

58:50.945 --> 58:52.905
