WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:06.208
found in six bags
in the Hastings River at Wauchope

00:06.209 --> 00:09.088
as those of missing prisoner
Terry Falconer.

00:09.089 --> 00:11.528
You're the dog who murdered
my grandparents.

00:11.529 --> 00:14.548
Take a look at this. These are
the ones who killed Terry Falconer.

00:14.638 --> 00:16.157
That's Anthony Perish.

00:16.158 --> 00:19.437
My old man used to say, "You gotta
do the right thing," you know?

00:19.438 --> 00:21.677
"Even if it hurts.

00:21.678 --> 00:23.797
"The more it hurts,
the righter it is."

00:23.798 --> 00:25.396
Mate, are you sure
this informant of yours

00:25.397 --> 00:27.038
isn't just leading you by the nose?

00:27.039 --> 00:29.117
He's not a bad suspect
for Falconer himself.

00:29.118 --> 00:30.717
This guy is as sound...

00:30.718 --> 00:32.357
and as reliable as they get.

00:32.357 --> 00:34.117
Gary Jubelin.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.038
You dropped me in it,
didn't ya, hey?

00:36.039 --> 00:38.037
You told Perish I was doggin' him.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.316
Anthony Perish hasn't ever
had an account with Telstra

00:40.317 --> 00:42.238
or any of the private
phone companies.

00:42.239 --> 00:45.037
He's not registered with the
Housing Commission, Medicare

00:45.038 --> 00:46.518
or any private health fund.

00:46.519 --> 00:48.757
No super fund has any record of him.

00:48.758 --> 00:50.917
He's got no outstanding fines,

00:50.918 --> 00:53.677
no traffic infringements,
he's not on the electoral roll,

00:53.678 --> 00:56.237
got no tax-file number,
no credit history.

00:56.238 --> 00:59.277
Only someone with
serious badness to hide

00:59.278 --> 01:02.278
would go to this much effort
to cover their tracks.

01:54.598 --> 01:56.117
Gary Jubelin?

01:56.118 --> 01:57.438
Pam Young?

01:59.398 --> 02:01.198
Mm-hm.

02:04.398 --> 02:05.878
Nuh.

02:07.998 --> 02:13.398
Nuh. No, Sandro, I can drive myself.

02:14.958 --> 02:16.637
Mm-hm.

02:16.638 --> 02:18.598
OK, I'll see you down there.

02:23.078 --> 02:24.757
There's a murder in Wollongong.

02:24.758 --> 02:26.758
Sounds like a gay bashing.

02:27.918 --> 02:30.437
Sometimes I wonder what it's like...

02:30.438 --> 02:32.637
a normal life.

02:32.638 --> 02:34.158
No, you don't.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.958
See you when I see you, Jubelin.
Good luck catching your ghost.

02:45.718 --> 02:47.197
Be careful.

02:47.198 --> 02:49.957
Almost a year into the
Terry Falconer murder investigation,

02:49.958 --> 02:53.837
Gary Jubelin was no closer to
finding his elusive prime suspect,

02:53.838 --> 02:58.397
Anthony John Michael Perish,
the ghost.

02:58.398 --> 02:59.957
What Gary didn't know,

02:59.958 --> 03:05.997
the ghost was studying him and his
illustrious career just as closely.

03:05.998 --> 03:08.238
Know your enemy.

03:10.038 --> 03:11.638
You're a star, mate.

03:19.838 --> 03:21.238
Cop star.

03:22.878 --> 03:24.837
For more than a decade,

03:24.838 --> 03:27.837
Anthony Perish had managed to
fly under the radar,

03:27.838 --> 03:29.918
invisible to police eyes.

03:32.958 --> 03:34.877
Unlike most criminals,

03:34.878 --> 03:37.718
he went to great trouble to leave
no trace of his passing.

03:39.118 --> 03:42.878
He had never put a foot wrong
until Terry Falconer came along.

03:54.878 --> 03:58.318
Clear?
Don't rush me, OK?

04:00.758 --> 04:05.077
For fuck's sake, Frank, I'm bustin'
for the loo. Are we clear?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.157
We're clear. Go on.
Go on, get in, get in.

04:07.158 --> 04:09.157
You, sometimes, I swear...
Shut the door.

04:09.158 --> 04:10.918
OK.
Alright?

04:32.838 --> 04:34.878
Pippa! Come here!

04:37.518 --> 04:38.998
What?!

04:39.998 --> 04:41.597
Fucking hell!

04:41.598 --> 04:43.757
What?!
Look.

04:43.758 --> 04:46.957
Yeah, looks like a Jatz cracker.

04:46.958 --> 04:48.477
It's a sign.

04:48.478 --> 04:49.998
It's a biscuit.

04:52.158 --> 04:54.397
Rooster and Undies
have been here, eh?

04:54.398 --> 04:56.358
More likely that little kid
from next door.

04:56.359 --> 04:59.637
No, it's a warning, OK?
Now, get inside.

04:59.638 --> 05:01.838
Did you lock the front door?
Jeepers, you... you're scaring me.

05:01.839 --> 05:04.837
You ought to be scared, eh?
No, you! YOU'RE scaring me.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.718
Hey, inside. Go. Move it. Let's go.

05:06.719 --> 05:08.597
Fucking hell.
Get inside. Inside.

05:08.598 --> 05:10.557
Gary Jubelin's
second major focus

05:10.558 --> 05:14.477
was the man codenamed 'Informant X'.

05:14.478 --> 05:17.957
He knew Francis Xavier O'Rourke's
evidence would be crucial

05:17.958 --> 05:22.358
if he ever got the chance to put
Anthony Perish on trial for murder.

05:24.718 --> 05:26.838
You tipped off Rooster, eh?

05:28.398 --> 05:30.758
And why would I do that?
Well, you're in his pocket.

05:30.759 --> 05:33.557
You're up to your fuckin' eyeballs
in Falconer's murder.

05:33.558 --> 05:35.077
You, Rooster, Undies.

05:35.078 --> 05:37.077
And now you're trying to
stitch me up over it.

05:37.078 --> 05:38.718
That's a load of
paranoid bullshit, Frank.

05:38.719 --> 05:40.398
Correct.

05:41.438 --> 05:44.597
And I'm just crazy enough
to pull that trigger, huh?

05:44.598 --> 05:47.198
Oh, shit!
What?

05:54.198 --> 05:57.877
Now, you agreed
to come alone, right?

05:57.878 --> 05:59.718
Sorry, Frank, it's procedure.

06:01.958 --> 06:04.317
Listen to me. Listen.

06:04.318 --> 06:06.037
If I wanted to fit you up,

06:06.038 --> 06:09.317
I would have planted
Terry Falconer's DNA in your house.

06:09.318 --> 06:13.597
Well, maybe you did, huh?
Maybe I just haven't found it yet.

06:13.598 --> 06:15.358
Well, why am I tellin' you?

06:17.958 --> 06:19.438
Yeah.

06:21.558 --> 06:23.038
Good point.

06:34.598 --> 06:36.717
You know the best way
to lock this guy up?

06:36.718 --> 06:38.517
Rooster?

06:38.518 --> 06:40.477
Rooster.

06:40.478 --> 06:43.437
Get him bragging about it -
who did what,

06:43.438 --> 06:46.358
all the fuckin' gruesome details.

06:48.078 --> 06:49.558
Then you record it.

06:50.958 --> 06:54.478
You know who the best
person to do that is?

07:00.678 --> 07:03.317
You want me to wear a wire, huh?

07:03.318 --> 07:05.678
Against Anthony Perish?

07:06.958 --> 07:09.997
Oh, shit, was I wrong!

07:09.998 --> 07:11.556
Nah, you're not trying to
stitch me up.

07:11.557 --> 07:13.076
You wanna get me killed.
No, Frank...

07:13.077 --> 07:15.476
Yeah, that's what this is about,
you lyin' bloody squarehead, huh?

07:15.477 --> 07:17.918
I get blamed for Falconer, you
and Rooster go on your merry way,

07:17.919 --> 07:20.637
like a couple of bloody schoolyard
lovers, ya fuckin' idiot!

07:20.638 --> 07:23.037
Jesus Christ, eh?
Fuckin' dreaming.

07:23.038 --> 07:25.077
You like your little boys, do ya?

07:25.078 --> 07:26.798
You get you fuckin' head read, mate.

07:26.799 --> 07:28.877
Gary, you can't hang
an entire murder brief

07:28.878 --> 07:30.397
on one tattooed lunatic.

07:30.398 --> 07:31.876
He'll come around.
Bullshit.

07:31.877 --> 07:33.516
It's not bullshit.
He's turned his life around.

07:33.517 --> 07:35.118
Just have some faith
in human nature, will you?

07:35.119 --> 07:36.677
I got a tonne of faith, mate.

07:36.678 --> 07:40.037
I just don't have unlimited bucks
to back it up. My strong advice?

07:40.038 --> 07:43.237
Concentrate on catching
Anthony John Michael Perish

07:43.238 --> 07:46.278
while you've still got
a strike force to do it.

07:48.918 --> 07:50.238
Dickhead alert.

08:00.838 --> 08:02.318
Permission to come aboard.

08:04.078 --> 08:06.597
Oh, shit, is this necessary?

08:06.598 --> 08:08.317
Can't stay here now, can I?

08:08.318 --> 08:11.278
Not secure anymore -
all thanks to you.

08:12.318 --> 08:13.798
Can I have a private word?

08:17.878 --> 08:20.758
I've been thinking.
Yeah, well, don't.

08:21.838 --> 08:26.437
You know the best means of defence
is attack, right?

08:26.438 --> 08:28.717
The last thing the Living Deads
will expect

08:28.718 --> 08:30.957
is a direct assault
on their clubhouse.

08:30.958 --> 08:33.077
Yeah?

08:33.078 --> 08:36.918
Nah, listen. We firebomb the pricks.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.677
They come runnin' outside,
we put a few rounds into 'em.

08:40.678 --> 08:43.477
Not to kill, just to panic 'em,

08:43.477 --> 08:46.077
teach 'em who they're messing with.

08:46.078 --> 08:50.077
I got all the men lined up,
all the hardware.

08:50.078 --> 08:52.397
All I need is my orders.

08:52.398 --> 08:55.397
It'd start a bloody war, mate,
not finish it.

08:55.398 --> 08:57.198
And get the Gang Squad up our arse.

08:57.199 --> 08:58.477
No.

08:58.478 --> 09:00.438
And how am I supposed to
do business with 'em

09:00.439 --> 09:02.358
after a stunt like that, eh?

09:04.038 --> 09:05.518
Well, you got a better plan?

09:05.519 --> 09:07.717
Yeah, I do.

09:07.718 --> 09:09.597
Peace summit.

09:09.598 --> 09:12.077
A peace summit... with the Deads?

09:12.078 --> 09:14.478
Better work on your apology, mate.

09:20.078 --> 09:22.677
The keystone of
a successful informant relationship

09:22.678 --> 09:24.397
is trust, yeah?

09:24.398 --> 09:26.318
You have to believe
what he tells you,

09:26.319 --> 09:28.757
he has to believe
he's safe in your hands.

09:28.758 --> 09:30.238
The trouble with your Mr X

09:30.239 --> 09:33.877
is after a lifetime's bad
experiences with authority figures,

09:33.878 --> 09:36.277
he naturally assumes
you're going to betray him

09:36.278 --> 09:40.197
and, therefore, he'll never
let himself trust you

09:40.198 --> 09:43.117
unless he knows you trust him.

09:43.118 --> 09:45.398
So, how do we handle him, Sonya?

09:58.118 --> 10:01.518
You're late.
Were you organising back-up?

10:02.798 --> 10:04.917
I'm on me own, Frank.
I give you my word.

10:04.918 --> 10:07.357
What do you want, huh?

10:07.358 --> 10:10.117
I've already told you
everything I'm gonna tell you.

10:10.118 --> 10:12.238
Then why are you here?

10:14.278 --> 10:17.477
Aren't you gonna pat me down, huh?
No, I'm not.

10:17.478 --> 10:21.437
If we're gonna work together,
I've got to learn to trust you.

10:21.438 --> 10:22.917
And vice-versa.

10:22.918 --> 10:24.998
Sit down, Frank.

10:31.078 --> 10:33.318
Who says we're
working together, hmm?

10:35.638 --> 10:37.357
Here's what I reckon.

10:37.358 --> 10:39.236
I reckon you got two voices
in your head

10:39.237 --> 10:40.878
telling you
two very different things.

10:40.879 --> 10:44.038
Just two? Happy days.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.077
One of 'em's saying
"Never trust a cop,"

10:48.078 --> 10:52.157
and the other one's saying, "He's
telling you to do the right thing."

10:52.158 --> 10:54.797
And I reckon
that's your old man, Frank.

10:54.798 --> 10:57.878
And I reckon that's why you're here.

10:59.278 --> 11:01.477
I'm already a dead man,
talking to you.

11:01.478 --> 11:03.438
Why would I stick my neck out
even further?

11:03.439 --> 11:05.677
Well, what have you got to lose?

11:05.678 --> 11:07.158
They can't kill you twice.

11:08.358 --> 11:11.197
And you told me you didn't
want to go back to that life.

11:11.198 --> 11:13.757
It doesn't mean
I want to be a dog either.

11:13.758 --> 11:17.197
But you do want to be a better man.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.198
Don't ya?

11:21.158 --> 11:22.638
Is that what you want, Frank?

11:25.838 --> 11:27.518
Think about your old man, mate.

11:29.158 --> 11:30.677
Oh, every day, I do.

11:30.678 --> 11:33.118
And what was he like?

11:35.718 --> 11:37.678
He was an army man, drill sergeant.

11:39.078 --> 11:41.477
Was all spit and polish.

11:41.478 --> 11:43.997
He hated bikies, eh?
Thought they were all crims.

11:43.998 --> 11:46.477
Said if he ever caught me
on a Harley,

11:46.478 --> 11:48.758
he'd put a bullet in me head.

11:50.158 --> 11:53.598
I joined me first club
before I had me first naughty.

12:19.758 --> 12:21.277
You good?

12:21.278 --> 12:23.077
You know how it is.
Mm-hm.

12:23.078 --> 12:25.798
How are the kids?
Yeah, they're good.

12:29.638 --> 12:33.198
You OK?
Yeah, I'm good. Thanks for asking.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.838
I know it's you, Frank.

12:58.638 --> 13:00.958
Babe, what's wrong?

13:03.558 --> 13:05.238
I'll do it.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.318
Well, you're doing
the right thing, mate.

13:13.758 --> 13:15.638
Come here, beautiful.

13:24.518 --> 13:29.238
First, this maniac
beats my godson to a pulp.

13:30.278 --> 13:32.557
The kid'll be lucky to walk again.

13:32.558 --> 13:36.357
Then he comes after me
with a pair of frickin' six guns!

13:36.358 --> 13:39.437
Yeah, and the reason we're all
sitting here, freezing our tits off,

13:39.438 --> 13:42.038
the man wants to
apologise, Jasper, alright?

13:44.438 --> 13:47.717
Look, I had no idea
he was connected.

13:47.718 --> 13:50.797
What can I say?
The kid never said anything.

13:50.798 --> 13:53.957
So... it's at least 50% his fault.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.597
Why didn't he speak up?

13:55.598 --> 13:58.278
It's 'cause you were kicking seven
shades of fuckin' shit out of him.

13:59.678 --> 14:01.797
Put it down to collateral damage.

14:01.798 --> 14:04.918
You're a deadset cockhead, mate.

14:06.558 --> 14:09.797
We want compensation.
I'll give YOU 50 cents to fuck off!

14:09.798 --> 14:11.597
Stuff you, you...
Piss off!

14:11.598 --> 14:15.397
Hey, hey, hey, hey, not in me car!
A little decorum, for Christ's sake.

14:15.398 --> 14:17.077
Hey!
Get off!

14:17.078 --> 14:18.477
Settle down, you idiots.

14:18.478 --> 14:20.478
Get stuffed!

14:21.638 --> 14:22.798
Christ!

14:27.438 --> 14:31.237
Look, you got the moral high ground
here, Jasper. No argument.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.918
How much we talking?

14:35.238 --> 14:37.278
A million - cash.

14:38.358 --> 14:40.917
Plus 20 kilos of pills.

14:40.918 --> 14:43.598
Might have to dock
your wages there, digger.

14:44.918 --> 14:50.038
And I heard you supplied the Bloods
with grenade launchers.

14:51.678 --> 14:54.837
We might be able to
rustle up a few more.

14:54.838 --> 14:58.398
Will you take a deposit?
Say, uh, 20 grand?

14:59.838 --> 15:01.878
You wouldn't be thinking of
stiffing us, would ya?

15:01.879 --> 15:03.717
Jasper, mate.

15:03.718 --> 15:06.277
How long have you and I
been doing business for, eh?

15:06.278 --> 15:08.318
Come on. Forever.

15:19.158 --> 15:20.358
Fuck.

15:22.238 --> 15:24.758
Looks like the Living Dead are in
the market for a new president, eh?

15:26.478 --> 15:28.597
Any thoughts there, Kenny?

15:28.598 --> 15:32.237
Congratulations, mate.
Couldn't have picked a better man.

15:32.238 --> 15:35.357
Thanks, mate.
Yeah, congratulations, Mr President.

15:35.358 --> 15:37.397
Now, piss off.

15:37.398 --> 15:39.478
And don't forget
who done you this good turn.

15:49.358 --> 15:52.917
Man, right in the heart.
No blood, no mess.

15:52.918 --> 15:54.598
Beautiful!

16:02.278 --> 16:03.958
I owe you, Rooster.

16:05.758 --> 16:07.518
Yeah? You think?

16:28.287 --> 16:30.286
Mate, I got a boombox
smaller than that thing.

16:30.287 --> 16:33.606
I'm gettin' a beer, drown me
sorrows, you bloody amateurs.

16:33.607 --> 16:36.366
I'm going straight back to
the tech department after this,

16:36.367 --> 16:39.327
find the boss, rip his head off
and shit down his neck.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.526
You got my word
we'll do better, Frank.

16:43.527 --> 16:46.006
Say you do, right?

16:46.007 --> 16:48.207
Then what's me excuse
for lobbing on Rooster's doorstep?

16:48.208 --> 16:51.046
Well, the thing is we can't tell
you what to say. That's entrapment.

16:51.047 --> 16:55.047
Just gets
fuckin' better, doesn't it, eh?

16:56.847 --> 16:58.966
Frank, have you
been summonsed to appear

16:58.967 --> 17:01.326
at the new inquest
into the Perish grandparents?

17:01.327 --> 17:02.887
Me? No.

17:04.166 --> 17:08.166
Bit of an oversight.
Yeah. Could work.

17:21.247 --> 17:23.165
Cops.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.767
Had to be.

17:26.007 --> 17:30.166
Tink'd never tell. It's not
in his... whatcha-me-call-it, DNA.

17:30.167 --> 17:34.086
Besides, he knows what would
happen to him if he did.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.527
I don't know.

17:36.927 --> 17:39.046
Have you told Rooster?
Nuh.

17:39.047 --> 17:40.646
Don't.

17:40.647 --> 17:42.807
No need upsetting him
for no good reason.

17:44.247 --> 17:45.027
Yeah, and what if he finds out
we knew but never said nothin'?

17:49.287 --> 17:50.807
The main LD's in the bum bag.

17:52.727 --> 17:54.647
What if Undies asks
what's in it, eh?

17:54.648 --> 17:57.046
Well, just tell him... bums.

17:57.047 --> 18:01.046
That's funny, eh? Dark horse.
Funny. Hey?

18:01.047 --> 18:02.927
First back-up's in your phone.
Battery compartment.

18:02.928 --> 18:04.966
For fuck's sake, don't drop it.
First back-up?

18:04.967 --> 18:07.367
Second back-up's in your smokes,
behind the foil, see?

18:07.368 --> 18:08.446
Right.

18:08.447 --> 18:10.047
Don't forget
and chuck the pack away.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.686
Righto.
That's it.

18:11.687 --> 18:14.766
What if he gets onto me?
Where's MY back-up, huh?

18:14.767 --> 18:18.006
There isn't any, Frank.
You're on your own.

18:18.007 --> 18:19.966
Oh... right.

18:19.967 --> 18:22.407
You really know how to make a bloke
feel appreciated, Jubes, hey?

18:22.408 --> 18:25.927
Mr Positive. Hey?
We all set?

18:27.047 --> 18:28.047
Recording.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.886
Right, this is
Detective Sergeant Gary Jubelin

18:31.887 --> 18:33.327
and Francis Xavier O'Rourke.

18:33.328 --> 18:35.566
The time is 3:19pm,

18:35.567 --> 18:37.806
the date 30/11/02.

18:37.807 --> 18:41.206
This is the commencement of
an operation for Strike Force Tuno.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.206
In a short time,
you will be speaking to people

18:43.207 --> 18:45.886
who may be involved in
criminal activities.

18:45.887 --> 18:49.806
You may be asked questions, you may
need to give appropriate responses.

18:49.807 --> 18:53.686
I've also been authorised to provide
you with the following inducement...

18:53.687 --> 18:55.206
nothing you say or do

18:55.207 --> 18:57.687
can be used against you
in any court in this State.

18:57.688 --> 19:00.407
Do you understand that, Frank?

19:02.807 --> 19:06.246
I heard a whisper that
you'd been talking.

19:06.247 --> 19:07.927
To Tuno.

19:09.207 --> 19:11.446
Talking to tuna? What are you...?

19:11.447 --> 19:13.966
It's the task force that's
looking after the Falconer thing.

19:13.967 --> 19:16.286
Now, is that true, Tink?

19:16.287 --> 19:19.366
Yeah. Yeah, you bet
I've been talkin' to cops, eh?

19:19.367 --> 19:22.926
Check this out.
Yeah, I've been summonsed.

19:22.927 --> 19:26.686
The new inquest,
your grandpa's murder.

19:26.687 --> 19:29.646
I mean, shit, why do they
want to hear from me, huh?

19:29.647 --> 19:31.366
So, where's Rooster? He around?

19:31.367 --> 19:36.246
So, this... this is why the cops came
round? Serving you with a summons?

19:36.247 --> 19:39.006
Yeah. That's why
I need to see him, mate.

19:39.007 --> 19:41.085
I want to know how to play it
and what to do, right?

19:41.086 --> 19:42.567
Call him, will ya?
Yeah.

19:42.568 --> 19:45.086
Go on, call him now!
Yeah, I'll fucking call him!

19:45.087 --> 19:48.366
Good.

19:48.367 --> 19:51.606
See them photo-fits in the paper?
It looks like Rooster and me.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.206
I never read papers.
There's too much news, eh?

19:55.207 --> 19:58.446
Someone's been talking.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.646
What - are you sayin' I dogged?

20:00.647 --> 20:03.926
When have I ever dogged,
you paranoid fuck, hey?

20:03.927 --> 20:06.086
Fuckin' hell...
I'll call him later.

20:06.087 --> 20:08.926
Oh, now you're pulling my dick. Ring
the right fuckin' number, dude, hey?

20:08.927 --> 20:12.647
Hey, darl, have you got
the code for star pickets?

20:16.247 --> 20:18.487
I'll be back in a sec. Take that.

20:30.087 --> 20:32.086
O4...

20:32.087 --> 20:35.327
Don't take the fucking code sheet
off the fuckin' wall.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.846
OK. Um...

20:39.847 --> 20:41.406
I'll talk to him, OK?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.646
Hmm?

20:42.647 --> 20:45.886
Righto. Make sure you do, eh?

20:45.887 --> 20:48.206
Take it easy, Undies, eh?
Have a good day, mate.

20:48.207 --> 20:49.687
Yeah.

20:52.607 --> 20:56.446
0491 570...something,
something, something.

20:56.447 --> 20:58.046
I didn't get it, eh?

20:58.047 --> 20:59.525
This is Anthony's number, yeah?
Yeah.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.405
Didn't get the last three digits?
Well, slap my wrist.

21:01.406 --> 21:03.165
Stick a finger up me arse
if you want.

21:03.166 --> 21:05.327
I did get the make and model of
the dog and bone though, yeah?

21:05.328 --> 21:07.846
Smart piece of work, mate.
Well done.

21:07.847 --> 21:09.166
Thanks, Gary.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.326
Am I happy?

21:10.327 --> 21:14.006
Well, a Nokia 3315, plus the first
seven digits of the number.

21:14.007 --> 21:16.126
I'm optimistic you'll be happy.

21:16.127 --> 21:19.366
So, we need warrants for local phone
tower dumps for that period, yeah?

21:19.367 --> 21:21.486
Say, an hour either way.

21:21.487 --> 21:24.526
You realise a single tower dump
could cost $1,000 or more?

21:24.527 --> 21:26.007
Alright, well, get it done.

21:40.527 --> 21:42.007
You can't hide forever, pal.

22:25.909 --> 22:28.148
Want me to help?
It's a job for experts.

22:28.149 --> 22:30.427
You see, every mobile phone has
its own electronic signature.

22:30.428 --> 22:32.267
It's just a matter
of cross-checking...

22:32.268 --> 22:33.467
I know, Kevin, I know.

22:33.468 --> 22:35.149
The right make and model
with the partial number.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.868
When you find it,
can you call Gary Jubelin asap?

22:37.869 --> 22:39.389
Only if you give me his number.

22:49.149 --> 22:50.388
Camille?

22:50.389 --> 22:53.028
Kevin? You ID'd the number?

22:53.029 --> 22:55.228
Of course I did.
Am I not a professional?

22:55.229 --> 22:58.068
Now all you have to do
is get a warrant to pull it off.

22:58.069 --> 22:59.829
I'll call Gary J immediately.

23:26.909 --> 23:28.428
Wasn't expecting you this week.

23:28.429 --> 23:31.309
Just making sure
you're putting in the work.

23:32.309 --> 23:34.669
Look, how long do I have to stay
in this bloody dump?

23:34.670 --> 23:36.349
Long as I say so, hey?

23:37.349 --> 23:38.628
Hello?

23:38.629 --> 23:41.028
Sergeant Jubelin? Technical branch.

23:41.029 --> 23:42.549
We've identified the number.

23:44.549 --> 23:46.709
Anthony Perish's mobile number?

24:07.469 --> 24:08.989
Fuck!

24:21.629 --> 24:23.268
What's this in aid of?

24:23.269 --> 24:25.348
It's a carrot cake.

24:25.349 --> 24:28.388
And we're all just stopping work
to have cake now, are we?

24:28.389 --> 24:29.829
It's for your birthday, Jubelin.

24:29.830 --> 24:32.069
Happy birthday, Gaz.

24:37.269 --> 24:39.108
Yes, Kevin?

24:39.109 --> 24:41.269
There's been a slight mix-up, mate.

24:42.429 --> 24:43.909
Fuck!

24:44.949 --> 24:47.748
Have you got any idea how hard
everyone's been working to do this?

24:47.749 --> 24:50.749
You had one job to do. One job!

24:53.389 --> 24:55.708
Get out of here before I...

24:55.709 --> 24:57.549
It would be over a year
before Gary Jubelin

24:57.550 --> 25:00.349
got another chance
to bring down his prey.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.309
You are too cranky.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.988
I'm not cranky.
You are.

25:12.989 --> 25:15.149
You're too cranky.

25:17.189 --> 25:20.589
I'm not. Really, I'm not.

25:21.669 --> 25:23.749
Gary...

25:24.789 --> 25:28.629
Alright. I'm very bloody cranky.

25:31.589 --> 25:33.509
My fat aunt could have
figured out his number

25:33.510 --> 25:35.388
from what I told ya, eh?

25:35.389 --> 25:37.908
Yeah, it's a little more complex
than that, the whole warrant thing.

25:37.909 --> 25:40.548
The Listening Devices Act's a prick.

25:40.549 --> 25:42.549
What are you driving at?

25:45.829 --> 25:47.389
I need you to put the wire back on.

25:57.429 --> 25:59.268
Fuck me, Gary!

25:59.269 --> 26:02.468
Every time I front them dudes,
I risk me life. Don't you get that?

26:02.469 --> 26:05.708
Or you just don't give a fuck?
Huh? Huh?

26:05.709 --> 26:08.308
Hey, I know what they're
capable of, alright?

26:08.309 --> 26:10.829
I saw Terry Falconer's body parts.

26:12.269 --> 26:15.349
That's why it's imperative
we put him away.

26:16.389 --> 26:18.027
And your role in this
is vital, Frank.

26:18.028 --> 26:19.509
You're the only one who can do it.

26:23.269 --> 26:26.429
It's the right thing to do.
You know it.

26:41.189 --> 26:44.789
You mention my old man again,
I'll fuckin' chop YOU up.

26:47.229 --> 26:50.229
It's 'cause you left the pen
lid off - it's not working anymore.

26:51.789 --> 26:54.068
I haven't had a chance
to call him yet.

26:54.069 --> 26:56.828
Bullshit, Undies. Lazy cowboy.

26:56.829 --> 26:58.509
Give us his number, I'll call him.

26:59.509 --> 27:02.549
If I gave you his number,
he wouldn't be happy.

27:03.669 --> 27:05.948
Leave the summons with me
and I'll call him, OK?

27:05.949 --> 27:09.228
Just leave me to
fuckin' eat my hummus in peace.

27:09.229 --> 27:10.708
There's another thing.

27:10.709 --> 27:12.628
You know that money for me boat?

27:12.629 --> 27:14.508
I wanna pay him back.

27:14.509 --> 27:16.669
It's only a couple of grand.
Don't stress out about it.

27:16.670 --> 27:18.708
Oh, I know the way he works, right?

27:18.709 --> 27:20.109
I want to pay him back every cent.

27:20.110 --> 27:22.188
You tell him that, OK?
OK.

27:22.189 --> 27:24.028
So, one more thing.

27:24.029 --> 27:25.669
You're giving me
a fuckin' headache, Tink.

27:25.670 --> 27:27.229
Mate, it's important, right?

27:28.509 --> 27:29.628
What?

27:29.629 --> 27:31.428
Now, you know that document?

27:31.429 --> 27:34.188
What document - this one?

27:34.189 --> 27:37.308
No. The document you and Rooster
came round and showed me, right?

27:37.309 --> 27:39.789
The one that said Falconer
had been dogging to the jacks.

27:41.189 --> 27:43.748
I just remembered something.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.828
What?!
I handled it.

27:46.829 --> 27:49.588
You know what I'm sayin'?

27:49.589 --> 27:51.748
It's got me fingerprints on it.

27:51.749 --> 27:53.828
Tink, there's probably
100 fingerprints

27:53.829 --> 27:55.307
on that fuckin' document.

27:55.308 --> 27:56.747
What if these Tuna dudes decide

27:56.748 --> 27:59.069
I'm suspect number one 'cause of me
record, and link me to you?

27:59.070 --> 28:00.068
Tink...

28:00.069 --> 28:02.229
That's why I gotta talk to Rooster.
I gotta bloody clear this up!

28:02.230 --> 28:04.789
Shut up, alright?
You just need to relax.

28:07.469 --> 28:10.828
I will... I will call him
and set up a meeting, alright?

28:10.829 --> 28:14.068
But you just need to relax, alright?
'Cause nobody knows that we did it.

28:14.069 --> 28:17.349
Nobody knows it was us
who killed the prick.

28:24.909 --> 28:28.308
"Nobody knows it was us
who killed the prick."

28:28.309 --> 28:31.148
Yeah?

28:31.149 --> 28:33.988
You sure that's what he said?
Yeah. What do you say, boys? Huh?

28:33.989 --> 28:35.588
Huh?! Hey?

28:35.589 --> 28:37.388
Sensational.
Eh? Eh?

28:37.389 --> 28:39.708
Gold star, mate. Gold, gold!

28:39.709 --> 28:41.508
I fuckin'... I deserve a beer, eh?

28:41.509 --> 28:44.989
Six bloody beers! 100 bloody beers!
Bring 'em on!

28:49.949 --> 28:52.069
It's a forklift or something.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.667
We sent it off-site
to get it enhanced,

28:55.668 --> 28:57.469
they've sent it on to
some experts in London, but...

28:57.470 --> 28:59.988
What about the back-ups?

28:59.989 --> 29:01.788
Same, only worse.

29:01.789 --> 29:03.989
Better luck next time.

29:05.789 --> 29:08.229
We can't take a fucking trick.

29:10.029 --> 29:12.109
Who's gonna tell Francis Xavier?

29:14.469 --> 29:15.709
Fuck!

29:18.629 --> 29:20.748
So, what - you want me to go back?

29:20.749 --> 29:23.149
Try again, huh?

29:24.629 --> 29:26.909
That'd be good.
Fuck!

29:31.709 --> 29:33.949
We'd also like you
to make a full statement, Frank.

29:35.469 --> 29:38.228
Put down on paper
everything you've told us...

29:38.229 --> 29:41.028
names, dates, details.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.548
Your full criminal history.

29:42.549 --> 29:44.028
What? No! No way!

29:44.029 --> 29:45.507
It's just a way of formalising...

29:45.508 --> 29:47.749
I make a statement, the whole world
knows I've dogged me mates.

29:47.750 --> 29:50.868
Right? No.
They're not your mates.

29:50.869 --> 29:54.308
You fuckin' idiots don't understand
a thing, right? Now get out!

29:54.309 --> 29:56.628
Go on, get out!

29:56.629 --> 29:59.268
Wait up, idiot. Fuckin'...

29:59.269 --> 30:01.908
Take this bastard, right?

30:01.909 --> 30:03.869
I was gonna give it to you anyway.

30:05.029 --> 30:06.509
What the fuck is this, Frank?

30:06.510 --> 30:08.748
Haven't you ever seen
a pipe bomb before, hmm?

30:08.749 --> 30:10.828
Had it rigged
to protect me front door, yeah?

30:10.829 --> 30:13.548
They usually make 'em
out of galvanised pipe

30:13.549 --> 30:15.389
but this one's PVC,
so don't bump it.

30:15.390 --> 30:17.668
Now get out of my face,
you bloody idiots,

30:17.669 --> 30:19.389
and take that piece of junk
with you.

30:19.390 --> 30:20.589
Go on. Get!

30:22.389 --> 30:23.949
Watch your step.

30:25.869 --> 30:27.829
I'll call the Bomb Squad.

30:28.909 --> 30:30.667
We can't risk bringing them here
and exposing Frank.

30:30.668 --> 30:32.149
Tell 'em we'll meet them in a park.

30:32.150 --> 30:34.508
Hey! Youse blokes want a Coke?

30:34.509 --> 30:36.748
No thanks.
No?

30:36.749 --> 30:38.829
We get the bomb there how?

30:40.429 --> 30:43.989
Stick it in the boot
and drive very fucking carefully.

30:48.469 --> 30:51.869
Mum wanted me to be a dentist.
Brownie...

30:54.829 --> 30:57.109
Sorry, Pippa.

31:05.069 --> 31:08.028
Transporting an IED
in the boot of a car?

31:08.029 --> 31:11.269
Didn't you idiots
do any explosives training?

32:00.791 --> 32:04.030
Anthony Perish
had a habit of using people.

32:04.031 --> 32:06.510
Buy them, bully them,
manipulate them.

32:06.511 --> 32:10.031
As long as they did exactly
what he wanted, nobody got hurt.

32:11.751 --> 32:13.310
Decker was handy.

32:13.311 --> 32:15.910
He had his uses,
but he was accident-prone

32:15.911 --> 32:18.670
and he had to be punished
for past mistakes.

32:18.671 --> 32:20.190
That's one reason

32:20.191 --> 32:23.510
Anthony kept him a virtual prisoner
at his Girvan property

32:23.511 --> 32:25.630
for three lonely months.

32:25.631 --> 32:27.871
And since he was sitting up there,
cooling his heels,

32:27.872 --> 32:31.190
Anthony put him to work
installing a defence system.

32:31.191 --> 32:34.470
After all, there was
a lot to protect.

32:34.471 --> 32:37.110
A single cook-up
from this one drug lab

32:37.111 --> 32:40.471
could produce several million
dollars worth of amphetamines.

33:02.111 --> 33:03.870
Eat up, champ.
It'll get cold.

33:03.871 --> 33:07.510
Well, why are you all eating pizza
and I'm not?

33:07.511 --> 33:10.670
I brung you a special treat,
that's why. Don't you like it?

33:10.671 --> 33:13.470
It smells funny.

33:13.471 --> 33:15.630
What are you talkin' about?

33:15.631 --> 33:18.150
It's the best chicken and chips
on the coast.

33:18.151 --> 33:20.511
It was lovely the other night
when we had it, wasn't it, Muzzy?

33:20.512 --> 33:23.950
Yeah. Uh, Monday?
It was scrumptious.

33:23.951 --> 33:27.911
Monday? That's a...
that's a week ago.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.590
Fair enough.

33:40.591 --> 33:42.510
Cheers.

33:42.511 --> 33:46.431
Whoo! Look out teeth,
look out gums, eh?

33:49.831 --> 33:51.311
Oh, come on. Where are you goin'?

33:55.751 --> 33:57.830
By the way, cops have
posted a reward

33:57.831 --> 33:59.711
for that little shoot-up
of yours at JB's.

33:59.712 --> 34:01.150
100 grand.

34:01.151 --> 34:04.751
Hope you haven't been big-noting
yourself to your bogan mates.

34:09.710 --> 34:11.909
Security's my middle name, Rooster.

34:11.911 --> 34:14.469
Glad to hear it.

34:14.471 --> 34:18.351
Eat up. It's rude
to leave food on your plate.

34:48.710 --> 34:51.230
There's a story going around

34:51.231 --> 34:53.429
that when Anthony Perish
was a teenager,

34:53.431 --> 34:56.429
he shot 200 cats.

34:56.431 --> 34:58.670
It's probably apocryphal.

34:58.671 --> 35:00.990
I mean, who was counting?

35:00.991 --> 35:03.511
But where there's smoke...

35:08.071 --> 35:10.431
Did the Gillespies say
why they were getting rid of it?

35:10.432 --> 35:13.350
Well, see, they're going
back to England, and Mum's allergic.

35:13.351 --> 35:14.911
You're my last resort.

35:15.991 --> 35:17.510
And what about the RSPCA?

35:17.511 --> 35:19.990
I can't believe you said that.

35:19.991 --> 35:21.590
Hello?

35:21.591 --> 35:23.511
Sweetie, if I wanted a dog,
I would have got a proper dog.

35:23.512 --> 35:26.430
Alright? Not a white,
fluffy dog. Who is it?

35:26.431 --> 35:29.311
Some guy called Frank.
Says his life's in danger.

35:30.631 --> 35:32.590
What's the matter?

35:32.591 --> 35:34.710
Is that your son just now?

35:34.711 --> 35:36.270
No.

35:36.271 --> 35:37.751
It's the guy who cleans my guns.

35:39.711 --> 35:41.230
He sounds alright, eh?

35:41.231 --> 35:43.031
What do you want, Frank?

35:44.511 --> 35:47.070
This'd be what you cops call
an induced statement, yeah?

35:47.071 --> 35:49.750
We'd never use it
to bring charges against you.

35:49.751 --> 35:51.910
Unless, of course, you lie to me.

35:51.911 --> 35:53.991
Then they'd want to
throw the book at you.

35:55.071 --> 35:59.830
Let's be clear, Gary.
I'm not signing it, alright?

35:59.831 --> 36:01.550
It'd just be for you.

36:01.551 --> 36:04.431
I can't risk word getting back to
our mate. You know what I'm saying?

36:05.511 --> 36:09.071
And I need my bloody head read,
that's for sure. Later.

36:17.311 --> 36:18.951
Oh, my giddy aunt.

36:21.671 --> 36:22.950
Hey?

36:22.951 --> 36:25.310
Hey, Rooster, you fucker!

36:25.311 --> 36:26.790
Hey?

36:26.791 --> 36:30.510
How'd you know where I was,
you fuckin' bastard?!

36:30.511 --> 36:33.791
Come on, come and get me,
you bastard!

36:39.871 --> 36:42.151
Hey? You fucker!

36:43.591 --> 36:47.391
Hey! Come on Rooster,
I'm not afraid of you!

37:01.529 --> 37:03.249
I nearly got a part
in 'Muriel's Wedding.

37:03.250 --> 37:05.608
Except they said I was too tall.

37:05.609 --> 37:08.569
I mean, go figure that out.

37:09.569 --> 37:12.728
He was here a minute ago.

37:12.729 --> 37:14.449
What have you done with him?

37:19.209 --> 37:21.449
Frank, you're not well.
Come back to the hospital.

37:21.450 --> 37:22.968
Fuck off.

37:22.969 --> 37:25.008
Babe, don't do this to me.

37:25.009 --> 37:28.208
Frankie!
You need blood. You need surgery.

37:28.209 --> 37:30.689
You need antibiotics.
We can protect you from Rooster.

37:30.690 --> 37:33.928
No-one can protect me
from the Rooster.

37:33.929 --> 37:36.008
He's everywhere.

37:36.009 --> 37:40.089
It was an accident.
Rooster had nothing to do with it.

37:42.649 --> 37:44.408
Frank, get in the fuckin' car.

37:44.409 --> 37:45.928
- Frankie!
- Soldier!

37:45.929 --> 37:48.488
Get in the car, mate.

37:48.489 --> 37:50.328
Brownie, grab his arm.

37:50.329 --> 37:53.248
Gary decided
a remote, secluded beach house

37:53.249 --> 37:55.728
was the best place
to debrief Frank O'Rourke...

37:55.729 --> 37:58.888
far away from girls, booze, dope...

37:58.889 --> 38:00.688
and helicopters.

38:00.689 --> 38:03.928
So, Undies picked you up and took
you to a restaurant in Newtown.

38:03.929 --> 38:06.728
That's where you met Anthony Perish?

38:06.729 --> 38:09.008
Yeah, well, it sounds right, yeah.

38:09.009 --> 38:10.569
What - it sounds right
or is it right?

38:10.570 --> 38:13.648
Righty-right, Captain, eh?

38:13.649 --> 38:16.808
Was this October 16th or 17th?

38:16.809 --> 38:19.208
Uh...

38:19.209 --> 38:21.608
I give up, eh? I can't remember.

38:21.609 --> 38:23.049
Well, what day of the week was it?

38:24.329 --> 38:29.288
Uh... Pippa wasn't
working that night.

38:29.289 --> 38:31.769
Could have been a Wednesday, eh?
Yeah, Wednesday.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.608
Wednesday was the 17th.

38:33.609 --> 38:35.049
What was the name of the restaurant?

38:36.369 --> 38:39.168
How am I supposed to remember that?
Well, try concentrating.

38:39.169 --> 38:42.168
Where was it? Was it King Street?
Oh, shit.

38:42.169 --> 38:44.488
Look, we've been over this
before, Frank.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.207
Alright, what sort of
cuisine was it?

38:46.208 --> 38:48.167
Was it Asian, was it Italian,
was it Martian?

38:48.168 --> 38:50.169
Did you like it? Could you eat it?
Did you enjoy it?

38:50.170 --> 38:51.808
Gary, how would I know, mate? Hey?

38:51.809 --> 38:54.289
All I remember is I didn't want to
be there and I was shittin' bricks.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.928
What does it matter?
It matters, Frank! Alright?

38:56.929 --> 38:59.207
We have to dot every i,
get every detail correct,

38:59.208 --> 39:00.809
or the defence
is going to rip us apart.

39:00.810 --> 39:03.488
That's assuming we get to court.
Court?

39:03.489 --> 39:05.408
I never agreed to no court!

39:05.409 --> 39:07.369
I'm not goin' nowhere near
no fuckin' bloody court!

39:07.370 --> 39:09.488
Alright, alright, relax.
Alright, just think.

39:09.489 --> 39:13.448
Was the restaurant... was it flash,
was it downmarket?

39:13.449 --> 39:14.929
Think, Frank.

39:15.929 --> 39:17.648
It was flash.

39:17.649 --> 39:19.128
Flash, yeah.

39:19.129 --> 39:21.008
OK, I've got Newtown restaurants.

39:21.009 --> 39:24.208
Jesus, there are hundreds,
so get comfy.

39:24.209 --> 39:26.248
This could take a while.
From the top.

39:26.249 --> 39:29.489
Alberto's Pizzeria?
Does it ring any bells, Frank?

39:30.489 --> 39:32.609
Anise.
Booze.

39:44.969 --> 39:46.768
Rooster.

39:46.769 --> 39:49.408
Making good progress, champion.

39:49.409 --> 39:51.849
You'll be asking for a pay rise.

39:54.009 --> 39:56.168
Any wage at all would be a bonus.

39:56.169 --> 39:58.969
Yeah, nah, I'm gonna miss ya.

40:04.049 --> 40:05.649
What do you mean?

40:06.649 --> 40:11.169
You can't hang around up here,
enjoying yourself forever, hey?

40:16.449 --> 40:19.408
So, you're cool if I just leave?

40:19.409 --> 40:21.409
Yeah, you done a good job, mate.

41:39.449 --> 41:43.488
Useless till he signs it,
if he signs it.

41:43.489 --> 41:46.368
Well, you can use it
as a scribble pad if he doesn't.

41:46.369 --> 41:49.448
Having said that,
it's quite an achievement.

41:49.449 --> 41:54.048
Well done him, and you, Gary.
He will sign, yes?

41:54.049 --> 41:56.409
Well, it's his better nature
fighting his criminal instinct.

41:56.410 --> 41:58.088
But, yeah, I think he will.

41:58.089 --> 42:01.888
I'm afraid there's not very much
in the budget to resettle him.

42:01.889 --> 42:04.128
Well, how much is not very much?

42:04.129 --> 42:07.488
Two grand? Pull the other one.
That is a disgrace.

42:07.489 --> 42:09.288
We can't go back to him with that.

42:09.289 --> 42:11.529
Don't have much choice, do we?
Short of robbing a bank.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.249
What if we chipped in ourselves?

42:29.325 --> 42:32.284
If you don't sign,
you don't get relocated.

42:32.285 --> 42:35.485
You're dead anyway.
Mm.

42:36.805 --> 42:39.405
Only closer to home.

42:41.125 --> 42:45.365
What about the relocation money?
Just another lie, was it, huh?

42:50.765 --> 42:55.284
It's a bank statement.
Account's in your name.

42:55.285 --> 42:57.245
Your new name.

42:59.405 --> 43:02.764
This six grand? For me?

43:02.765 --> 43:05.245
It's not a lot, mate.
It's all we could do.

43:12.245 --> 43:15.165
I can't believe
you're for real sometimes.

43:21.405 --> 43:24.084
But you've got to sign and date
every page of that.

43:24.085 --> 43:26.085
And you gotta stand by it.

43:27.445 --> 43:29.045
Which means what?

43:31.245 --> 43:33.724
You know what it means, Frank.

43:33.725 --> 43:35.845
It means you gotta look Rooster
in the eye in court one day

43:35.846 --> 43:37.964
and you gotta tell the jury
what happened.

43:37.965 --> 43:40.365
That's what it means.

43:48.205 --> 43:52.725
Might like to learn a trade, eh?
Something with me hands.

43:54.645 --> 43:57.564
You any good with your hands? Hey?

43:57.565 --> 44:00.245
No, I'm not, Frank.
Yeah, I wouldn't think so.

44:03.925 --> 44:05.405
Give me that pen.

44:13.845 --> 44:18.604
Francis Xavier O'Rourke
is a fictional name.

44:18.605 --> 44:20.764
The man himself is real,

44:20.765 --> 44:25.484
but his true identity cannot be
revealed by order of the court.

44:25.485 --> 44:28.324
He was relocated,
instructed to keep his head down

44:28.325 --> 44:31.204
and wait for the day Tuno officers
would call on him

44:31.205 --> 44:36.005
to testify against
Anthony John Michael Perish.

44:41.525 --> 44:43.365
You are not so cranky today.

44:44.405 --> 44:46.044
How can you tell?

44:46.045 --> 44:48.445
I cannot hear your teeth grinding.

44:51.765 --> 44:53.685
Things going better at work?

44:54.845 --> 44:57.525
Yep.
And at home?

45:00.045 --> 45:01.964
Got a dog.

45:01.965 --> 45:04.205
He likes cheese.

45:05.405 --> 45:09.485
Cheese is good, in moderation.

45:11.685 --> 45:16.445
Now, fei chang fang, monkey style.
