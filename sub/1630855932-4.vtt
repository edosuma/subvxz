WEBVTT

00:06.715 --> 00:09.718
["YKI" playing]

00:21.855 --> 00:23.273
[vehicle approaching]

00:27.485 --> 00:30.447
[men] Do it! Do it! Do it!

00:30.447 --> 00:32.282
He shoots it off every 40 minutes.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.035
[Ness] And that is considered art?

00:35.618 --> 00:38.455
Come on. This is Art Basel.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.041
The greatest artists in the world
come here.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.334
You really have to
embrace the weird, okay?

00:43.334 --> 00:45.128
Last year, I paid to be in a room

00:45.128 --> 00:48.423
with an Australian man folding laundry
for 16 hours straight.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.675
- [laughs]
- [Felix] Oh, love it here.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.719
[Santi] I'm so inspired right now.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.389
Ness, can we go to Michaels after this
to get arts and crafts and stuff?

00:56.389 --> 00:58.600
Uh, okay, <i>cálmate.</i>
You're still a musician.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.561
You can make weird art nobody likes
after you make it big.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.354
Oh, my God, Zale Bonus is here.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.273
Is that a person or a jewelry store?

01:05.273 --> 01:07.525
He's the biggest name
in digital art investing!

01:07.525 --> 01:10.070
His podcast, <i>We Was Cryptos,</i>
is fucking genius.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.530
[sarcastically] Wow.
Sounds like an amazing guy.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.617
Holy shit, he's having a panel.
We have to go.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.036
Miss a once-in-a-lifetime
collection of artists

01:18.036 --> 01:21.247
to listen to a tech bro you get off to
in the shower? Uh-uh.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.083
[scoffs] I don't get off to him.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.959
I'm sorry. Keep at it, champ.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.628
[sighs] Let's put it to a vote.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.922
All in favor of going
to the Zale Bonus talk?

01:31.174 --> 01:32.050
[chuckles]

01:33.301 --> 01:34.844
Oh, this is a y'all conversation.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.346
- [gunshot]
- [crowd cheering]

01:36.346 --> 01:38.181
Ugh! Missed it.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.855
There's so much
to love about artists, y'all.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.024
They bring beauty into our world.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.110
They push our culture forward.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.029
And, honestly, they usually got
the best fucking drugs.

01:53.029 --> 01:55.365
[audience laughing]

01:55.365 --> 01:57.617
I ain't promoting, that's just the data.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.911
All right, let's get serious, though.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.956
Who gets to be an artist in today's world?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.666
People like you and me, my sister?

02:05.667 --> 02:07.502
No. I want our artists

02:08.419 --> 02:11.756
to succeed and thrive,
but that's not what happens, is it?

02:11.756 --> 02:14.342
Nope. They get priced
out of they own cities.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.595
Can't even live there,
can't even paint there.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.639
On top of that, you do get poppin',

02:19.639 --> 02:21.599
and you get gouged by art dealers.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.853
Don't we wanna create a world
where everybody can be an artist?

02:24.853 --> 02:26.521
- [audience] Yeah!
- Right?

02:26.521 --> 02:29.149
Not just white people,
you know what I'm saying?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.025
Black folks, brown folks.

02:31.025 --> 02:33.111
Latina girls, Asian motherfuckers,

02:33.111 --> 02:35.405
everybody can make art

02:35.405 --> 02:36.823
and not be placed

02:37.740 --> 02:38.992
- in a box.
- [Ness] Right.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.494
- Yep.
- And that's why

02:41.494 --> 02:43.746
I'm so excited to announce

02:43.746 --> 02:46.332
- our newest initiative, y'all.
- [man whooping]

02:46.332 --> 02:48.710
An artist incubator,

02:48.710 --> 02:50.587
built specifically to help fund

02:51.421 --> 02:52.547
GOC,

02:52.547 --> 02:56.593
aka Geniuses of Color.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.970
- All right. Let's go.
- [audience cheering]

03:01.014 --> 03:02.640
Let me hear you say GOC!

03:02.640 --> 03:03.892
- [audience] GOC!
- GOC!

03:03.892 --> 03:04.934
GOC!

03:04.934 --> 03:07.687
Wait, you think
this guy would, like, fund me?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.856
Or is he only talking
paint and paper artists?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.566
- Paint and paper?
- [Ness] No, no.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.359
I mean, you are a Genius of Color.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.069
- Been saying it for years.
- Wait.

03:15.069 --> 03:18.031
I'm gonna make this happen
because this guy's loaded.

03:18.031 --> 03:22.744
He wants to blow it on art
and maybe he could blow it on me.

03:23.328 --> 03:27.373
Uh, okay, but wouldn't it be weird
to be backed by, like, a non-label, Mia?

03:27.373 --> 03:29.375
Oh, no, I think it's a great idea.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.337
New musicians get weird funding
in this town all the time.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.172
- All right.
- I bet he'd be into you.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.591
Look at him,
he has incredible fucking instincts.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.676
Ahhh!

03:38.676 --> 03:40.762
[audience cheering]

03:47.977 --> 03:49.979
[funky music playing]

03:52.106 --> 03:54.817
Why'd you tell Santi
this benefactor was a good idea?

03:54.817 --> 03:57.779
Aren't you supposed to be
pretending you're gonna sign us?

03:57.779 --> 04:01.699
Getting funding from outside doesn't
prevent me from signing him, Felix.

04:01.699 --> 04:02.951
If anything, it helps.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.744
How?

04:04.744 --> 04:08.456
A patron provides capital
for you guys to record new music,

04:08.456 --> 04:11.376
you get some good radio play,
make another video.

04:11.376 --> 04:15.171
It's just gonna make it easier to bring
him to the label at the perfect time.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.715
Aren't you worried he's gonna become

04:17.715 --> 04:21.302
this trusted advisor to Santi
and help him build his career so much

04:21.302 --> 04:24.555
he realizes he doesn't need you
or the label to sign him?

04:24.555 --> 04:27.016
The dude who was on stage
using a dick cannon?

04:28.142 --> 04:29.435
I think we'll be fine.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.900
Hey, you remember that time
I ate your finger?

04:36.526 --> 04:38.444
- That was cool, right?
- Shut up, Felix.

04:38.987 --> 04:39.821
[chuckles]

04:44.784 --> 04:47.578
[Ness] There he is.
Okay, there's gotta be 20 other artists

04:47.578 --> 04:49.247
waiting to chat him up. None are white.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.541
- We don't even have that going for us.
- [Santi] Ness.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.543
Please breathe.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.504
[both breathing deeply]

04:56.504 --> 04:58.673
- Okay.
- I got this.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.593
Excuse me. There he is. Look at you!

05:02.593 --> 05:05.346
This is-- Oh, my God, dude.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.765
This shirt is crazy.

05:07.765 --> 05:11.394
You look like you're in a hurricane
or something, with the blue hair.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.813
Yo. I know who you are.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.398
- Yeah?
- You're the dude that

05:15.398 --> 05:17.233
- remixed that "Eduardo" song.
- [Santi] Yes!

05:17.233 --> 05:19.694
- [Zale] That's some good content.
- Thank you.

05:19.694 --> 05:23.364
I'm glad you enjoyed it. You know,
my team, we worked so hard on it.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.450

- Vanessa Peguero.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.330
- Hi.
- People call me Ness.

05:30.330 --> 05:34.125
It's a privilege, pleasure and honor
to be meeting you, sir, and my God!

05:34.125 --> 05:35.793
Your hand is incredibly soft.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.504
You gotta tell me
what kind of lotion you use, right?

05:38.629 --> 05:41.841
I must say, not to fangirl,
but I listen to your podcast religiously.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.510
Your innovation knows no bounds,
and we are tickled

05:44.510 --> 05:46.137
that you enjoyed the campaign

05:46.137 --> 05:48.848
that I conceptualized, produced
and brought in under budget.

05:48.848 --> 05:53.061
Yo, no misogyny or nothing,
but you gotta chill a little bit,

05:53.061 --> 05:54.979
- you know? You're good, though.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.481
Grocery store homie, your name?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.483
- Santi.
- Santi.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.611
My financially obligated time
to be here is officially over,

06:01.611 --> 06:03.780
so I gotta bounce. It's real dry in here.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.698
But let me get your phone real quick.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.783
Oh, yeah.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.036
[Zale] So, this is where we 'bout to be.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.706
Come through with your team
and we'll chop it up a little bit more.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.459
All right, my boy.
Let's get out of here. All right.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.419
All right, yo, I'll see you later.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.963
- You're gonna leave me hanging?
- [Zale] Yeah.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.383
- I'mma catch you next time.
- [Zale] All right.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.677
[grunts] Let's go!

06:43.403 --> 06:44.237
Hey, Ramon.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.989
- Hey, Mia.
- Well, I have Santi and his team here.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.035
Not seeing Santi on the list, Mia.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.454
Oh, well, look.

06:53.454 --> 06:56.165
The label and I were really trying
to woo Santi,

06:56.165 --> 06:58.835
and I feel like Oscar
would be really upset

06:58.835 --> 07:02.130
if he didn't go
to his first paid brand campaign,

07:02.130 --> 07:04.799
if it was because your dyslexia
was acting up again.

07:07.927 --> 07:08.761
All right, Mia.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.681
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, Ramon.

["Get Money Get Money" playing]

07:25.778 --> 07:28.030
Felix, let's go find Zale,

07:28.030 --> 07:30.199
I'll get cool with him,
he'll wanna fund us,

07:30.199 --> 07:33.327
and then Ness, you come in
with all the business-y stuff like...

07:33.327 --> 07:36.622
Like interest rates and shit. Come on.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.460
[both chuckle]

07:43.588 --> 07:45.339
Hey, uh, how do you do that?

07:45.339 --> 07:46.883
- Ramon?
- Yeah.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.968
- Oh, we go way back.
- [chuckles]

07:50.219 --> 07:53.848
No, I... I mean, like, um,
how do you, like, you know, just

07:53.848 --> 07:54.974
get shit done?

07:56.100 --> 07:59.854
Well, look, it's about making people
feel like they're in power,

07:59.854 --> 08:03.107
when actually you're the one
pulling the strings. [chuckles]

08:03.107 --> 08:06.194
I won't make myself smaller
to make people feel more comfortable.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.863
Ness, that's literally the job.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.782
If you wanna manage Santi,
you have to become

08:11.782 --> 08:14.202
a million versions of yourself
to get what you want.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.120
It's not about making yourself smaller,

08:16.120 --> 08:18.873
it's about tricking people
into thinking they're bigger.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.501
Right.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.046
I think I'm gonna go work the room

08:25.046 --> 08:28.049
and trick some people
into thinking they're in charge.

I really want you to meet.

- He's, like, savant level.

- Okay.
- Javier Luna.

A pleasure, my brother.

on Twitter, bruv.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.587
You called him "Internet famous."

09:48.170 --> 09:52.466
I'm so sorry, my bro. I was really
going through it a few months ago.

- Oh, damn.

09:57.096 --> 09:57.930
I'm so sorry.

09:58.514 --> 10:01.684
I've been trying to get Zale
to back me up for my real talent

10:01.684 --> 10:04.395
but my label says I'm crazy.
They don't know shit.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.523
So, what's your, uh, real talent?
If this is like...

10:07.523 --> 10:09.025
Magic.

[Santi laughing]

10:16.157 --> 10:17.241

10:17.241 --> 10:18.451
Why are you laughing?

10:19.076 --> 10:20.036
I mean, I was just...

10:21.203 --> 10:22.496
Fucking magic, dude.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.666
Well, like, the thing about magic
is it's always, like,

10:25.666 --> 10:27.209
"Oh, my God, how did you do that?"

10:27.209 --> 10:29.211
[Javier laughs] Right?

10:29.211 --> 10:31.339
Thanks. I tried to tell my manager that,

10:31.339 --> 10:33.174
and they look at me like I'm crazy.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.842
Yeah, well, that's suits for you.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.469

- Please.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.685
- Wanna see a trick?
- [Santi] I'm good.

10:44.685 --> 10:47.355
- I'm still working on it, but...
- [Santi] Oh.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.065
- Oh, shit!
- [Zale] What the fuck?

10:49.065 --> 10:52.401
- [Javier exhales] I mean...
- Crazy. [laughing]

10:52.401 --> 10:54.028
["Guaya" playing]

11:00.451 --> 11:01.744
Hi, I'm Ness.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.371
Terrence, with a T.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.289
- [chuckling] Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

11:05.289 --> 11:08.668
So, uh, what brings you
to Art Basel, Ness?

11:09.168 --> 11:12.004
Uh, I rep an artist
in the Urbano music space.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.923
- Do you?
- I do.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.634
Well, I actually happen to work
in music PR myself.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.886
- Do you, now?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.221
[laughing] Okay.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.597
Maybe we could, you know,

11:21.597 --> 11:24.100
have a few drinks,
talk about business sometimes?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.143
- What do you think?
- You're absolutely right.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.979
We should talk about you
helping my client in the PR space.

11:28.979 --> 11:32.108
No. [clears throat]
That's not how I phrased it at all.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.693
Oh, no, no. You definitely did

11:33.693 --> 11:36.153
and it was a great call
on your part. [laughing]

11:36.153 --> 11:39.198
- I remember 'cause you just said it.
- [chuckling]

11:39.198 --> 11:41.117
Look, I gotta go meet some friends.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.786
Nice seeing you.
Maybe we'll see each other again.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.996
Hey, remember, it was your idea!

11:45.996 --> 11:47.707
You're the one in control!

11:47.707 --> 11:50.042
Okay, came on a bit strong there, champ.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.627
You told me to come on strong.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.087
You're right.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.631
He's just probably intimidated.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.384
Okay, game plan. On the next one,

11:58.384 --> 12:01.137
I should, uh...
I should play it a little cooler

12:01.137 --> 12:03.889
- and, like, coddle his ego, right?
- Up to you.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.227
You are a master manipulator. [scoffing]

12:09.270 --> 12:11.772
A woman is good at her job
and she's a manipulator?

12:11.772 --> 12:14.400
No, I... No, I didn't mean that you were--

12:14.400 --> 12:17.903
- You... Fuck. You are good at this.
- Yes, I am. Keep up, Ness.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.447
["Guaya" playing]

12:22.783 --> 12:25.244
Okay, wait, so, you, like,
push it in? Not out?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.204
- In, not out.
- Cool.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.957
- Oh, shit. Uh...
- You almost got it.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.625
- Try one more time.
- [Felix] Oh.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.712
Yo, I can't believe
how much of a weirdo Javier Luna is.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.629
[both laughing]

12:35.629 --> 12:37.715
I don't know. He seems normal to me.

12:37.715 --> 12:38.924
Get rid of him for me.

12:39.842 --> 12:40.968
What, like...

12:41.761 --> 12:44.847
No! Just bring him over there
so I can talk to Zale.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.432
[exhales] Yes, I can do that.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.018
I would kill for you
under the right circumstances.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.603
Yo, pick a card. Pick a card.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.271
- Pick a card.
- [Santi] Any card?

12:52.271 --> 12:54.607
Yo, Javi. There's this VR exhibit.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.693
You can experience what it's like
to be awake during surgery.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.905
- I am in.
- Let's check it out.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.826
- [Santi] Zale.
- What's up?

13:05.826 --> 13:07.787
- How you doin'? [laughs]
- What's up?

13:07.787 --> 13:10.539
- All right, all right.
- Yo, listen, man. Um...

13:10.539 --> 13:15.336
I really connected with all the stuff
that you were saying earlier and...

13:15.336 --> 13:18.798
- Mmm. Mmm.
- And I feel like... Like I can be the one.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.009
Because I do know that
you got a lot of other potential artists

13:22.009 --> 13:25.221
that are interested,
but I bring something that's different,

13:25.221 --> 13:28.390
and I feel we would just be
the perfect match to be working--

13:28.390 --> 13:29.642
I'm down.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.728
Wait, wait. Like... Like, really?

13:32.728 --> 13:34.897
Yeah. I'mma hit you with some funds, bro.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.024
- Stop, bro! No way.
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.985
I thought I was gonna have to sell you
on my career goals,

13:39.985 --> 13:42.530
on... On like, my team, on my whole vision,

13:42.530 --> 13:44.365
- and you just saying, "Yeah?"
- Nah.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.742
- I don't give a fuck about that.
- [sighs]

13:46.742 --> 13:48.661
All these artists I kicked it with,

13:48.661 --> 13:51.205
- you're the only one that's just chill.
- [exhales]

13:51.205 --> 13:52.498
Like, you just get me.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.250
Motherfuckers talking about what?

13:54.250 --> 13:55.960
- All this David Blaine shit.
- [scoffs]

13:55.960 --> 13:58.546
This one dude like, "This is my destiny."

13:58.546 --> 14:00.714
"I was born to do it." Shut the fuck up.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.050
- That's not me.
- Exactly. Me and you,

14:03.050 --> 14:05.261
- we're on the same wavelength.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.430
- Same frequency. Same exact frequency.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.807
You just wanna make music--

14:09.807 --> 14:11.267
- Make music. Mmm.
- Party.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.518
- Fuck bitches.
- Yep.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.519
And that's it.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.438
Right. I mean,
I definitely do love those things,

14:16.438 --> 14:18.524
but, you know, it's also about the art.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.609
Nah, not really.

14:20.609 --> 14:24.488
What about, like, the Geniuses of Color
stuff that you were talking about?

14:25.114 --> 14:28.492
Well, my PR team, they made me do that

14:28.492 --> 14:30.494
'cause I was getting some heat online.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.955
They say I work with
too many white people,

14:32.955 --> 14:34.164
but it ain't my fault.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.624
They got all the money.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.877
What you want me to do? I want the money.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.838
[chuckles] So, wait.
Oh, you don't care about the art?

14:41.422 --> 14:43.841
I mean, come on, bro. Look at this shit.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.176
This is silly. This is all fake.

14:46.176 --> 14:49.388
Art is just some weird shit
motherfuckers make up.

14:49.388 --> 14:50.848
It's just commerce.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.183
You better learn that, buddy. Hey, yo!

14:53.183 --> 14:56.937
Bitch with the big ole booty. Yeah,
butterfly. Can a nigga get a dance?

14:58.147 --> 14:59.148
[Javier] You know what?

14:59.148 --> 15:02.401
I've always wanted
to do magic in a music video.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.111
Oh, my God, you should. Wait.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.321
- Uh, uh...
- Right?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.617
- What if you sawed yourself in half?
- Uh-huh.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.368
Classic magician's trick.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.787
And your torso is singing.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.415
And we follow both your torso
and your legs

15:16.415 --> 15:19.752
as they lead separate
but completely depressing lives.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.211
That is the kind of shit

15:21.211 --> 15:23.172
- I was talking about, bro.
- [chuckles]

15:23.172 --> 15:24.882
We should definitely do that.

15:24.882 --> 15:25.883
Oh, wow.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.135
I'd love to,

15:28.135 --> 15:30.971
but, uh, I can't cheat on Santi like that.

15:30.971 --> 15:34.600
You don't art direct for anybody else?
For real, for real?

15:35.184 --> 15:39.271
For real, for reals.
It's, uh, monogamy vibes for us.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.942
Respect, but if you ever change your mind,

15:43.817 --> 15:45.778
a magician always needs an assistant.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.863
- [chuckles]
- And you know what I mean.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.239
I think I do.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.616
But I should probably

15:50.616 --> 15:52.868
- find my current magician.
- Mmm.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.454
- Peace, my brother.
- Peace, my brother. [chuckles]

15:55.454 --> 15:58.207
What the fuck! Oh, my God. Sorry. I...

15:58.207 --> 16:00.459
Very scary. Good job. Oh, my God.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.551
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.889
Fuck it, I can't do this.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.976
You are so clearly
the most boring man on the planet, so...

16:21.021 --> 16:21.981

16:22.731 --> 16:23.941
I think you seem nice.

16:37.871 --> 16:38.706
Hmm.

16:46.922 --> 16:47.923
I love that.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.175
Your look.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.262
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.432
- It's vintage.
- Cool.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.018
This your first Art Basel?

16:59.018 --> 17:02.021
Yeah. Yeah, um, we just moved here.

17:02.980 --> 17:03.897
We?

17:05.315 --> 17:09.653
My, uh, client and I
just moved here from Fort Myers.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.821
What do you do?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.115
I'm...

17:14.450 --> 17:15.826
a music manager.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.038
[laughs] At least, I am trying to be
a music manager.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.331
You have a client, right?

17:21.331 --> 17:22.708
Yeah.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.295
Then you're a fucking music manager.

Uh, a new reggaeton artist.
His name's Santi.

pressed for time, but...

18:10.464 --> 18:12.883
I'd love to figure out
how we can work together.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.135
If you're interested.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.723
Absolutely. Uh, yeah.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.810
Are you, like, a producer? Do you, um...

18:22.810 --> 18:24.895
Do you finance artists, or...

18:24.895 --> 18:26.605
I'm a little bit of everything.

18:27.689 --> 18:31.318
- Right. [chuckles]
- I can explain more at my place.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.195
I'll have a car pick you up in 15.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.781
We can head over there and discuss.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.743
Yeah. Discuss at your place. Cool. Cool.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.328

- She?

- Why you so out of breath?
- Doesn't matter.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.053
Tell me you didn't sign with Zale Bonus.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.097
No, that guy fucking sucks.

The guy with the Crypto podcast?

19:03.475 --> 19:04.726
- You were right.
- [Mia chuckles]

19:04.726 --> 19:09.606
Well, this woman is super rich,
she's a huge fan of yours.

She's super hot,
her hair's, like, really shiny.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.154
- How is that relevant?
- 'Cause she's fucking hot.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.532
Now get your shit together,
we are going to her house tonight.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.744
You guys have fun. I'm gonna stay here.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.496
Gotta talk to people from the label.

Okay. You're missing out though
because she is sending us a car.

- She got money!
- Yeah, she got money.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.232
This is quite the place that you have.

I actually have a couple of these.
They're good investments.

You would be more than welcome

20:38.153 --> 20:40.489

You will not be the exception.

Let me give you some cash.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.908
Say... [inhales sharply]

21:24.908 --> 21:26.410
[exhales]

21:26.410 --> 21:27.327
three...

21:29.621 --> 21:30.664
Four hundred grand?

21:30.664 --> 21:33.875
I'll hook you up
with my studio connections, producer,

21:34.543 --> 21:39.256
you'll lay down some great tracks
and we will all get very rich together.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.215
[all chuckling]

21:40.215 --> 21:43.593
I know it sounds crazy,
but look around you.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.805
It really is that simple
when you're with me.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.809
What do you say? You in?

21:54.688 --> 21:56.565
- Fuck it. Uh, I just...
- [Ness chuckles]

21:56.565 --> 21:59.318
I think that everything feels right
right now,

21:59.901 --> 22:03.655
and I think the universe
is just telling me to say yes!

22:03.655 --> 22:06.033
- [Ness] Yes!
- We're in! Yes!

22:06.033 --> 22:07.326
Fantastic.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.330
We'll set up the paperwork in my office,
all very standard.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.708
Okay, so, uh, do we come in Monday
to, like, sign, or...

22:14.708 --> 22:16.543
[laughs] No!

22:16.543 --> 22:18.962
We'll do it now.
It's all very straightforward.

22:18.962 --> 22:21.006
Don't sign anything
if you're not comfortable.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.799
Oh, okay. Uh, wow.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.801
- [man] They're waiting for you.
- Okay.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.346
Guys, this is Gabriel,
he's my business partner.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.638
He'll set everything up.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.682
I have to take care of some business,

22:30.682 --> 22:33.268
but then we will pop the champagne!

22:33.268 --> 22:35.062
I love how much you say business.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.898
- Business.
- [Ness chuckling]

22:42.652 --> 22:43.570
Stay here.

22:47.074 --> 22:47.908
[door opens]

22:49.743 --> 22:50.577
[door closes]

22:52.037 --> 22:54.539
- [imitates Gabriel] Stay here.
- [all laughing]

22:54.539 --> 22:58.126
- [in normal voice] Guy's fucking weird.
- [Santi] She has a waterfall?

23:00.629 --> 23:03.965
Ooh, goddamn! Santi, check out this shit.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.051
- [Ness] What the fuck are you doing?
- Ooh!

23:06.051 --> 23:08.470
Going through her shit.
What do you think I'm doing?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.055
That's really weird, man. Stop!

23:10.055 --> 23:12.391
[Santi] Yo, she is rich!

23:12.391 --> 23:13.683
[Felix] Whoa.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.937
Guys, this is weird, right?

23:16.937 --> 23:18.563
[Ness] That could be anything.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.649
That could be, like, a wrapped book,

23:20.649 --> 23:21.983
or first edition book.

23:21.983 --> 23:25.195
She must, like,
really like wrapping books.

23:26.029 --> 23:29.074
Okay, it's a brick of cocaine.
She said she likes to have parties.

23:29.074 --> 23:33.036
It's Miami. Is it really that weird
to have a couple bricks at a party?

23:33.036 --> 23:34.538
- Party animals!
- [Ness] Exactly.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.705
Guys, she has a gun.

23:35.705 --> 23:36.915
[Santi and Ness] Whoa!

23:36.915 --> 23:38.667
- [Santi] Whoa.
- Put that shit down!

23:38.667 --> 23:39.835
Stop opening drawers!

23:41.253 --> 23:44.714
[whispering] Oh, shit.
There's so many guns in that drawer.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.757
[Ness] What?

23:46.341 --> 23:48.051
Who the fuck are we dealing with?

23:48.051 --> 23:51.012
[spluttering] A business lady, I don't--

23:51.012 --> 23:53.557
Fuck, I should have known.
Look at this waterfall.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.016
She's a <i>James Bond</i> villain.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.727
She's clearly a fucking <i>bichota.</i>

23:57.727 --> 24:00.230
What's that mean?
Like, <i>James Bond</i> in Spanish?

24:00.230 --> 24:02.732
Coke dealer, drug dealer, big shot.

24:02.732 --> 24:05.068
We haven't signed anything yet, right?

24:05.068 --> 24:08.280
So, we can just say that
we had a change of heart,

24:08.280 --> 24:10.866
and that we are looking
to stay independent. Done.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.367
Yeah, great idea,

24:12.367 --> 24:14.494
because international drug traffickers

24:14.494 --> 24:16.955
- are famously reasonable.
- [woman] What's going on?

24:16.955 --> 24:18.123
Hey!

24:18.123 --> 24:21.001
- Girl! Hey, you!
- Hey.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.920
- [in high-pitched voice] Hey, girl.
- [Ness laughs]

24:23.920 --> 24:26.381
- [Santi] What's up?
- You just call me a drug trafficker?

24:26.381 --> 24:27.924
Uh...

24:27.924 --> 24:31.011
[woman] Why is there a gun
and bricks of cocaine on my desk?

24:31.595 --> 24:33.263
- Is that what that is?
- Hmm, yeah.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.267
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.768
[woman laughing maniacally]

24:40.353 --> 24:41.438
Oh, fuck.

24:42.355 --> 24:43.482
Please.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.567
I wish you guys could see yourselves.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.195
- [imitates gunshot]
- [Felix whimpers]

24:48.195 --> 24:49.488
I mean...

24:50.864 --> 24:52.073
It'd be weird if I just...

24:53.158 --> 24:55.243
went all <i>Scarface</i> on you, right? Like...

24:55.243 --> 24:56.661
- [imitates gunshots]
- [whimpers]

24:56.661 --> 24:57.829
[laughs maniacally]

24:58.622 --> 25:00.749
Oh, you okay?

25:00.749 --> 25:04.169
Guys, I'm just fucking with you.
Come on, chill. [laughs]

25:04.169 --> 25:05.962
It's really not what you think.

25:05.962 --> 25:07.672
- Relax.
- Okay.

25:08.715 --> 25:09.883
You're not a drug dealer?

25:09.883 --> 25:11.635
You need to stop using that word.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.137
He's so stupid!
He says the stupidest shit all the time!

25:14.137 --> 25:15.597
Don't listen to him. Right?

25:15.597 --> 25:17.933
Stupid, stupid, random, awkward, crazy!

25:17.933 --> 25:20.393
[all laughing]

25:25.732 --> 25:26.900
Okay.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.735
Are we ready to sign this contract?

25:29.444 --> 25:30.278
Huh?

25:31.363 --> 25:33.573
[laughs] Aw.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.117
Do you not wanna sign?

25:36.785 --> 25:38.119
Uh...

25:38.119 --> 25:39.913
It's not that I don't want to.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.249
You don't need to, if you don't want to.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.417
- We don't?
- No. I know

25:44.417 --> 25:46.795
what we agreed to
and I always stick to my word.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.004
The question is...

25:50.715 --> 25:51.716
do you?

25:55.345 --> 25:56.179
Yeah.

25:56.179 --> 25:58.557
- I feel great about this.
- [woman] Great.

25:58.557 --> 26:03.061
Excellent. Now that we're all
in business together, let's fucking party.

26:03.937 --> 26:04.980
[Ness chuckles]

26:04.980 --> 26:08.275
Anyone know where we can get
some good cocaine?

26:11.778 --> 26:13.280
[chuckles nervously]

26:14.573 --> 26:16.783
Guys, I don't actually
feel great about this.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.787
