00:11.953 --> 00:13.949
There's this creature thing.

00:13.951 --> 00:16.384
People worship it.

00:16.386 --> 00:18.450
It's sucking the life out of me.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.312
Intense pressure.

00:20.314 --> 00:21.578
It was so cold,

00:21.580 --> 00:23.973
and I just wanted it to go away.

00:23.975 --> 00:26.671
It's causing sickness.

00:26.673 --> 00:29.999
My dad is so sick,
and no one can figure out why.

00:30.001 --> 00:34.526
They just get tortured
by this [Bleep] thing.

00:34.528 --> 00:37.261
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:37.263 --> 00:40.457
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.459 --> 00:41.682
What's happening?

00:41.982 --> 00:43.080
I see dead people.

00:43.082 --> 00:45.512
It seems like a devil.

00:45.514 --> 00:48.147
I speak to dead people.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.145
He's pissed off.

00:49.147 --> 00:50.309
And they speak to me.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.443
I felt real fear.

00:52.445 --> 00:55.412
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:55.414 --> 00:57.419
I think she's being murdered.

00:57.421 --> 00:59.023
I rely on my partner.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.288
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:00.290 --> 01:02.286
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:02.288 --> 01:04.384
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:04.385 --> 01:07.584
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.586 --> 01:08.783
Nobody believes me.

01:08.785 --> 01:10.246
It's my job to reveal them.

01:10.248 --> 01:12.511
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:12.513 --> 01:14.244
But Steve and I never speak...

01:14.246 --> 01:16.278
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.479
...until the very end.

01:17.481 --> 01:19.245
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.445
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:21.447 --> 01:23.512
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:23.514 --> 01:24.779
Or time to get out.

01:24.781 --> 01:27.882
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074

01:45.142 --> 01:47.005
I'm in Abilene, Texas.

01:47.007 --> 01:49.535
It's a small city about
two hours west of Dallas.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.300
Amy and I were called in

01:53.302 --> 01:55.432
by a retired Air Force veteran named Sean.

01:55.434 --> 01:58.700
Sean knows danger when he sees it,

01:58.702 --> 02:00.336
but he says that whatever's in this house

02:00.338 --> 02:01.468
is trying to kill him.

02:01.470 --> 02:04.869
I really hope we can help this veteran out.

02:08.472 --> 02:09.836
Before Amy arrives,

02:09.839 --> 02:11.804
I look for any leading information.

02:14.005 --> 02:15.939
Family photos and religious icons

02:15.941 --> 02:17.638
can influence her findings.

02:20.239 --> 02:22.273
So it's important that I
cover or remove them all

02:22.275 --> 02:24.475
before she begins her walk.

02:40.904 --> 02:44.534
I saw this church,

02:44.536 --> 02:48.032
and it was filled with
people and it was all good,

02:48.034 --> 02:50.700
but the church fell apart,
and the roof fell in.

02:50.702 --> 02:56.436
Then there's, like, this...creature thing.

02:59.942 --> 03:04.614
It creates paranoia and anger

03:04.616 --> 03:08.752
and fear and negativity
and obsessive thoughts.

03:08.754 --> 03:15.027
And it told me that it
can only take the souls

03:15.029 --> 03:17.993
of those who damn themselves.

03:17.995 --> 03:21.999
But it'll take on any
form to help them do that.

03:30.239 --> 03:31.739
Well, Sean, I'm glad I'm here now

03:31.741 --> 03:33.607
'cause I'm a fellow vet like yourself,

03:33.609 --> 03:37.275
and when we spoke on the phone,
you sounded pretty upset.

03:37.277 --> 03:39.410
So why don't you tell me what's going on?

03:39.412 --> 03:41.612
We have apparitions.

03:41.614 --> 03:43.715
There's banging on the wall.

03:43.717 --> 03:47.087
Touching people, objects moving.

03:47.089 --> 03:49.525
I've been in some pretty rough situations,

03:49.527 --> 03:51.961
and what I've seen in Afghanistan and Iraq

03:51.963 --> 03:55.065
doesn't compare to what
I've seen in this house.

03:56.436 --> 03:59.102
Are you sure it's not post-traumatic stress,

03:59.104 --> 04:00.906
- anything like that?
- No.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.709
What makes you so sure?

04:02.711 --> 04:05.209
I've gone through counseling, evaluations.

04:05.211 --> 04:08.414
You name it, I've had it,
and nobody can explain it.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.117
Now, who lives here with you?

04:10.119 --> 04:12.688
We have eight family members in my house.

04:12.690 --> 04:14.587
- There's my mom...
- Okay.

04:14.589 --> 04:17.357
...and myself and my wife, Elizabeth;

04:17.358 --> 04:19.361
my oldest daughter is Tracy;

04:19.363 --> 04:22.096
my oldest son, Sean Jr.;

04:22.099 --> 04:24.033
my middle daughter, Rebecca;

04:24.035 --> 04:26.934
and then my middle son, Derek;

04:26.936 --> 04:29.069
and my youngest son, Nicholas.

04:29.071 --> 04:30.504
Now, let me ask you something...

04:30.506 --> 04:32.207
do you know any history
about the house at all?

04:32.209 --> 04:34.506
I know that the land, originally, way back,

04:34.508 --> 04:36.809
was Native American land.

04:36.811 --> 04:39.747
Okay, so how long are you living here?

04:39.749 --> 04:42.381
We've lived here since June of 2006.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.815
Okay, so why are you calling us in now?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.151
When we first moved here, things were minor.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.286
And over the last couple of years,

04:48.288 --> 04:52.024
things began just getting
a lot more extreme.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.993
Shortly after that happened,

04:53.995 --> 04:55.525
my health started to deteriorate.

04:55.527 --> 04:57.224
What kind of health issues
are we talking about here?

04:57.226 --> 04:58.658
I've had a stroke.

04:58.660 --> 05:01.729
I've had major embolisms with blood clots.

05:01.731 --> 05:04.835
I've got problems with my heart,
with my liver, with my lungs.

05:04.837 --> 05:08.104
I've gone to every type
of doctor you can name,

05:08.106 --> 05:10.073
and they don't have answers.

05:10.075 --> 05:11.642
Okay, how old are you?

05:11.644 --> 05:13.678
- 38 years old.
- You're 38.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.013
This is stuff 75-years-old go through.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.379
Here I have some pictures.

05:17.381 --> 05:20.914
As you can see, I was a fit person.

05:20.916 --> 05:22.380
I look much different.

05:22.382 --> 05:24.748
My life has gone on a complete turn

05:24.750 --> 05:26.246
since everything started.

05:26.248 --> 05:29.317
- You feel whatever's here is trying
to physically harm you. - Correct.

05:29.319 --> 05:31.454
I believe it's sucking the life out of me.

05:44.407 --> 05:46.877
I'm seeing this creature thing.

05:53.419 --> 05:58.922
It's causing a lot of
sickness for living people.

05:58.924 --> 06:01.659
They can't breathe.

06:01.661 --> 06:06.794
Intense pressure on their chest,
their stomach.

06:06.796 --> 06:10.333
To me, it's weird that the thing is in Texas

06:10.335 --> 06:13.569
and in a neighborhood like this.

06:13.571 --> 06:17.238
I think I know what this creature is,

06:17.240 --> 06:18.773
but I'm not sure because

06:18.775 --> 06:21.476
it's something usually seen
in other parts of the world.

06:21.478 --> 06:25.748
Whatever it is,
I know it's capable of causing major damage.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.684
People here...

06:27.686 --> 06:31.488
they just get [Bleep] tortured
by this [Bleep] thing.

06:38.269 --> 06:41.137
This room is very active for me.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.074
I was sleeping in bed with my wife.

06:43.076 --> 06:44.945
It was about 3:00 in the morning.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.582
My son Nicholas woke up screaming.

06:46.584 --> 06:49.749
I get up to pick up my son,
and he's pointing.

06:49.751 --> 06:53.489
And I look over here towards the closet,

06:53.491 --> 06:55.490
and both doors are wide open.

06:55.492 --> 06:58.094
I know when I went to bed,
the doors were closed.

06:58.096 --> 07:00.098
Did they open by themselves

07:00.100 --> 07:01.732
'cause they were off-kilter or something?

07:01.734 --> 07:03.833
No, they have a device in the top of them

07:03.835 --> 07:05.203
that clicks in place.

07:05.205 --> 07:06.938
- So you remember shutting it.
- Correct.

07:10.841 --> 07:14.045
I see what you're saying. So it locks in.

07:14.047 --> 07:15.515
Anything else in this room?

07:15.517 --> 07:17.116
So one morning, I wake up,

07:17.118 --> 07:18.752
I walk across the hallway right there,

07:18.754 --> 07:21.021
and as I step up into the laundry
room to go into the kitchen,

07:21.023 --> 07:24.491
I feel this just ice-cold
hand grab the back of my neck

07:24.493 --> 07:26.027
and squeeze my neck.

07:26.029 --> 07:29.162
At the same time,
I'm kind of looking to see who's behind me.

07:29.164 --> 07:32.467
There's nothing there.

07:35.569 --> 07:38.270
This creature thing is, like,

07:38.272 --> 07:41.374
putting its hands on their shoulders.

07:41.376 --> 07:43.742
And it almost feels like
if you took your finger

07:43.744 --> 07:46.110
and, like, pushed all the way back.

07:46.112 --> 07:50.047
It's like this intense, sharp pressure.

07:52.151 --> 07:54.353
So, anything else?

07:55.889 --> 07:57.956
I had woken up, opened my eyes,

07:57.958 --> 08:02.257
and I see a figure... completely black.

08:02.259 --> 08:03.727
It was very lanky, tall.

08:03.729 --> 08:05.360
He scuttled across the ceiling,

08:05.362 --> 08:06.760
and then its head turned,

08:06.762 --> 08:08.861
and it just real fast looked at me.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.931
It was human-somewhat-looking,

08:11.933 --> 08:13.800
but it had large eyes that were sunken in.

08:13.802 --> 08:15.903
It didn't really have a distinct mouth,

08:15.905 --> 08:17.771
but it looked angry.

08:17.773 --> 08:19.739
So it wasn't anything like a shadow

08:19.741 --> 08:22.173
- coming from outside that
could have made that? - No.

08:22.175 --> 08:24.843
- Cat walking by, anything crazy?
- No, no, no.

08:24.845 --> 08:26.715
The feeling that I get from this thing

08:26.717 --> 08:28.718
is that it's looking for me.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.285
It's after me.

08:30.287 --> 08:33.258
- You think it wants to get you out
of the picture here? - I think so.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.025
And my fear is that once it does,

08:35.028 --> 08:37.092
it's just gonna move on to my family.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.704
This creature thing...

08:47.706 --> 08:49.205
I see it on the ceiling.

08:49.207 --> 08:51.172
So that's interesting.

08:53.106 --> 08:57.413
It's just, like, hanging there and,
like, looking down.

08:57.415 --> 09:02.579
Its arms and its legs are,
like, stretched thin.

09:02.581 --> 09:07.282
It turns its head all the way
around to face the person.

09:09.152 --> 09:13.253
It's almost like an image of a human face.

09:13.255 --> 09:15.556
And I hear someone say, "Oh, my God.

09:15.558 --> 09:17.292
"We're gonna die, aren't we?

09:17.294 --> 09:19.228
This is going to kill us."

09:40.385 --> 09:42.518
So, Beth,
I was talking to your husband, Sean.

09:42.520 --> 09:43.986
He was telling me
everything that's happening.

09:43.988 --> 09:46.490
That's got to be tough on you. I mean...
- Absolutely.

09:46.492 --> 09:49.792
I mean, he believes that it's attacking him

09:49.794 --> 09:52.396
and that it could actually kill him.

09:52.398 --> 09:54.165
I know there's something there,
but I just can't see it.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.632
Now, what about yourself?

09:55.634 --> 09:57.668
Have you ever experienced
anything in the house?

09:57.670 --> 10:00.638
Yeah, one time,
I was getting ready to go in the shower,

10:00.640 --> 10:02.643
and all of a sudden, I hear the door,

10:02.645 --> 10:04.646
and it's, like, shaking.

10:04.648 --> 10:06.649
So I open the door,
and there's nobody there.

10:06.651 --> 10:09.252
So I yell. I'm like, "Sean!"

10:09.254 --> 10:11.387
So he's like, "What, what? What's going on?"

10:11.389 --> 10:13.790
I'm like, "Watch. Don't touch the door."

10:13.792 --> 10:16.060
And we waited, and then all of a sudden,

10:16.062 --> 10:18.098
the door just started shaking
all again all by itself.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.666
- In front of the both of you?
- Yeah.

10:19.668 --> 10:21.969
- Okay, it wasn't a heavy truck going
by down the road that... - Nope. No.

10:21.971 --> 10:24.943
- ...caused that?
- No. It was scary.

10:24.945 --> 10:27.112
Up until now,
I thought whatever's going on here

10:27.114 --> 10:29.413
was brought on by Sean's stress.

10:29.415 --> 10:30.780
But speaking with his wife,

10:30.782 --> 10:33.613
I get the feeling the activity
here isn't in his head.

10:33.615 --> 10:36.248
So psychologically,
that's got to be taking a toll on yourself.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.649
Mm-hmm.

10:37.651 --> 10:40.318
I try to keep it together, but it's hard.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.453
It's very stressful on the family.

10:42.455 --> 10:43.654
How are you dealing with it?

10:43.656 --> 10:45.823
We try, but the tension in the house

10:45.825 --> 10:48.127
sometimes gets really crazy.

10:54.298 --> 10:58.106
I think this thing...

10:58.108 --> 11:02.878
it creates a very hostile
and negative environment.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.851
Whatever's going on within this family

11:08.853 --> 11:13.857
is a direct result of its influence.

11:13.859 --> 11:17.792
They're just always, all of them,

11:17.794 --> 11:21.064
functioning out of anger or fear,

11:21.066 --> 11:24.305
hating on each other, basically.

11:24.307 --> 11:28.739
It's also making them do things...

11:28.741 --> 11:30.775
that they normally wouldn't do.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.677
Divide and conquer.

11:32.679 --> 11:35.678
That's kind of, I think,
what it's doing here.

11:41.286 --> 11:44.654
Rebecca, I was talking to Mom, Dad.

11:44.656 --> 11:47.121
There seems to be a lot of
stuff going on in the house.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.454
Let me ask you a question...
How old are you?

11:49.456 --> 11:51.890
- 13.
- Are you afraid to be here?

11:51.892 --> 11:55.394
Yeah, there's noises,
knocking, stuff like that.

11:55.396 --> 11:56.995
Explain it to me. What are you hearing?

11:56.997 --> 11:58.063
I'll wake up, and I'll feel like

11:58.065 --> 11:59.733
someone's standing in the doorway,

11:59.735 --> 12:01.700
and they're just staring at me, like...

12:01.702 --> 12:03.801
I'll run to my grandma's room sometimes.

12:03.803 --> 12:05.872
- You will?
- Yeah.

12:05.874 --> 12:07.573
- Are you close with your parents?
- Not really.

12:07.575 --> 12:10.509
Yeah.

12:10.511 --> 12:11.509
Okay.

12:11.511 --> 12:13.777
What bothers you?

12:13.779 --> 12:15.612
Why are you crying? Tell me.

12:15.614 --> 12:18.614
'Cause it just
annoys me how my dad is so sick,

12:18.616 --> 12:20.149
and no one can figure out why.

12:20.151 --> 12:22.818
It seems like this is bothering you

12:22.820 --> 12:25.887
- a lot more than you're telling people, right?
- Yes.

12:25.889 --> 12:28.356
I will never stay here alone.

12:33.532 --> 12:36.634
There's this kid.

12:36.636 --> 12:40.442
She's got long, brown hair, brown eyes.

12:40.444 --> 12:42.477
Maybe a teenager.

12:42.479 --> 12:43.779
She's very angry.

12:43.781 --> 12:47.648
I'm seeing a direct
interaction with a child...

12:47.650 --> 12:49.483
a female child...

12:49.485 --> 12:52.486
and this...thing.

12:55.256 --> 13:00.629
They're telling her what
they can do to her parents.

13:00.631 --> 13:02.997
And then this thing can come, and it says,

13:02.999 --> 13:05.196
"Hey.

13:05.198 --> 13:07.427
You want me to take care of them for you?"

13:07.429 --> 13:09.663
It's saying,

13:09.665 --> 13:13.866
"I take the souls of the
ones who damn themselves."

13:19.704 --> 13:21.705
So, Wilma, I was talking to your son,

13:21.707 --> 13:24.609
and he's going through a lot here.

13:24.611 --> 13:27.776
Oh, really a lot. We almost lost him.

13:27.778 --> 13:30.013
Every part of his body is being attacked,

13:30.015 --> 13:31.948
and nobody knows why.

13:31.950 --> 13:34.918
It's that...

13:34.920 --> 13:37.424
- It's hard to talk about, huh?
- Yeah.

13:37.426 --> 13:39.458
I'm so glad you're here.

13:39.460 --> 13:43.698
Yesterday, the house was very quiet.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.134
They were all out, except me,

13:46.136 --> 13:49.406
and I got up and I walked around.

13:49.408 --> 13:52.207
You know how you can feel
someone staring at you

13:52.209 --> 13:54.878
but there's no one there?

13:54.880 --> 13:57.014
And I challenged it, and I told him.

13:57.016 --> 14:00.182
I said, "I'm old,
but I'll do whatever you want me to do,

14:00.184 --> 14:02.051
but leave my son alone."

14:02.053 --> 14:05.987
And I said, "We believe in God,
and I'm not afraid of you."

14:05.989 --> 14:08.923
And when you say "him,"
what are we talking about?

14:08.925 --> 14:10.124
I think it's a man.

14:10.126 --> 14:11.726
And it's very evil.

14:11.728 --> 14:14.793
- I have seen it.
- What do you see?

14:14.795 --> 14:18.261
I told Sean
and he drew a picture.

14:18.263 --> 14:20.030
And I have it here. Let me see.

14:22.865 --> 14:24.733
Sean drew this.

14:24.735 --> 14:27.303
Okay, but have you seen this thing?

14:27.305 --> 14:29.643
I believe that is the shadow figure

14:29.645 --> 14:31.313
that came down the hallway.

14:31.315 --> 14:33.515
I had gone to bed,

14:33.517 --> 14:35.584
and I saw a shadow,

14:35.586 --> 14:38.355
and I'm saying, "Oh, please go away.
Please go away."

14:38.357 --> 14:44.126
And then I could hear

14:44.128 --> 14:46.560
And the air was coming on my neck.

14:46.562 --> 14:48.762
It was so cold.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.065
And I
just wanted it to go away.

14:51.067 --> 14:54.032
I said, "Please,"
'cause little Derek was next to me.

14:54.034 --> 14:56.898
And I was saying,
"Please don't hurt the baby."

14:56.900 --> 15:00.370
- I'm sorry.
- No.

15:00.372 --> 15:03.970
Here. Take that.

15:06.711 --> 15:09.777
Now, have you ever seen
any other apparitions?

15:09.779 --> 15:12.146
I see children in this room.

15:12.148 --> 15:14.047
How many kids are you seeing?

15:14.049 --> 15:15.449
- Three.
- Three.

15:15.451 --> 15:18.152
The girl and the boy and the older one.

15:18.154 --> 15:19.553
Okay.

15:19.555 --> 15:23.587
You can hear walking and
whispering and giggling.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.891
I don't let the kids go far from me.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.194
I don't even know...
could they take them or not?

15:32.264 --> 15:34.834
Like, I just see dirt,

15:34.836 --> 15:38.404
blood, dead bodies.

15:38.406 --> 15:40.875
These are the damned.
These are the lost ones.

15:40.877 --> 15:44.013
There is a lot of them.

15:44.015 --> 15:47.519
They make a lot of noise.

15:47.521 --> 15:49.989
And I feel like...

15:52.393 --> 15:55.930
...people around see them.

16:00.003 --> 16:02.270
I just see a bunch of dead people,

16:02.272 --> 16:05.975
like, coming in through the wall

16:05.977 --> 16:12.381
and just... being in this area.

16:12.383 --> 16:15.750
And there's, like,

16:15.752 --> 16:20.489
something inside of the bed in the mattress

16:20.491 --> 16:23.324
kind of scaring people.

16:23.326 --> 16:26.558
They just follow this thing.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.727
He...has them.

16:31.930 --> 16:37.932
I believe that this thing
caused their downfalls.

16:37.934 --> 16:39.500
What does it want with the living?

16:39.502 --> 16:41.770
For them to run their lives into the ground,

16:41.772 --> 16:45.475
to do bad things to
themselves and other people,

16:45.477 --> 16:47.178
to damn themselves.

17:00.697 --> 17:02.333
Sean told me he thought

17:02.335 --> 17:04.203
his property was once Native American land.

17:04.204 --> 17:07.538
Now, when clients tell
me this kind of stuff,

17:07.540 --> 17:09.008
I take it with a grain of salt.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.811
But I called a local author,
and he said Sean's right

17:11.814 --> 17:14.113
and that he has information
that might help my case.

17:21.489 --> 17:24.126
Well, Dr. Frazier,
thanks for meeting with me.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.759
- I appreciate that.
- Gladly.

17:25.761 --> 17:27.660
So you mentioned on the
phone my client was right.

17:27.662 --> 17:30.363
He thought that his property
was once Native American land.

17:30.365 --> 17:31.532
Absolutely.

17:31.534 --> 17:33.533
I mean, this place was a transit point

17:33.535 --> 17:35.437
for a lot of different
tribes over the years,

17:35.439 --> 17:37.308
- not just one.
- Okay.

17:37.310 --> 17:39.377
But the Jumanos occupied this land

17:39.379 --> 17:41.212
when the Spanish first show up.

17:41.214 --> 17:45.250
So they were here until
probably about the early 1700s.

17:45.252 --> 17:48.352
Early 1700s, Plains Apaches then come in

17:48.354 --> 17:52.892
- and displace the largely pedestrian Jumanos.
- Wow.

17:52.894 --> 17:54.792
I've never heard of Indians
displacing each other.

17:54.794 --> 17:56.325
This was a blood feud.

17:56.327 --> 17:58.760
So how bloody of a battle
are we talking about?

17:58.762 --> 18:00.930
If you're a fallen warrior,

18:00.932 --> 18:03.062
you can expect to have
your corpse mutilated.

18:03.064 --> 18:06.133
They'd cut off hands, cut off fingers.

18:06.135 --> 18:07.701
- Really?
- Very brutal.

18:07.703 --> 18:11.071
And then, the Apaches are
driven out by the Comanches.

18:11.073 --> 18:12.106
Goes for 100 years.

18:12.108 --> 18:14.609
So we're talking from the mid 1700s?

18:14.611 --> 18:16.645
Yeah, all the way into
the early 19th century.

18:16.647 --> 18:20.448
I mean, they fought the
Apaches hammer and tongs.

18:20.450 --> 18:22.654
I mean, they never gave
up fighting the Apaches

18:22.656 --> 18:24.889
- until the very, very end.
- Geez.

18:24.891 --> 18:28.193
They scalped people.
They'd eat livers sometimes.

18:28.195 --> 18:31.330
If they could make you
scream or beg for mercy,

18:31.332 --> 18:33.599
that's the ultimate power.

18:33.601 --> 18:34.832
These guys sound like

18:34.834 --> 18:36.465
- not somebody you want to mess with.
- Right.

18:36.467 --> 18:38.095
How do the white settlers
wind up dealing with it?

18:38.097 --> 18:40.431
Well, the settlers were on the losing end

18:40.433 --> 18:41.900
for several decades.

18:41.902 --> 18:44.533
I mean, really,
the Comanches ruled the roost out here

18:44.535 --> 18:48.074
from about 1770 to about 1870.

18:48.076 --> 18:53.611
There is a lot of anonymous
dying in this part of the world.

18:57.953 --> 19:00.589
There's a lot of panic.

19:00.591 --> 19:03.862
This old dude is talking.

19:03.864 --> 19:08.395
He's, like, saying,
"There's all of these wars that happened."

19:08.397 --> 19:12.735
And he's talking about the Native Americans.

19:12.737 --> 19:14.336
Well, like, with the Native Amer...

19:14.338 --> 19:17.339
I just see them, like, fighting.

19:17.341 --> 19:20.707
And then I just see them dead.

19:20.709 --> 19:22.875
I see their blood on the ground.

19:25.211 --> 19:27.179
There's other people later.

19:27.181 --> 19:28.649
So I keep seeing, like,

19:28.651 --> 19:30.418
different groups of people over time,

19:30.420 --> 19:32.354
and they're just dead on the ground,
bleeding.

19:32.356 --> 19:36.056
So what I'm thinking

19:36.058 --> 19:38.658
is that this thing...

19:38.660 --> 19:43.662
is causing... causing it.

19:43.664 --> 19:45.497
It's, like, instigating and fueling it.

19:45.499 --> 19:47.728
Yes. Yes.

19:47.730 --> 19:49.662
Now, Dr. Frazier, do you have any idea

19:49.664 --> 19:51.397
who the original white settler was

19:51.399 --> 19:52.864
on the property I'm investigating?

19:52.866 --> 19:56.501
John Hunter Herndon.
This is a picture of him.

19:56.503 --> 19:59.406
- Where's he from?
- He's a Kentuckian.

19:59.408 --> 20:03.774
And he's like so many Southerners.

20:03.776 --> 20:06.878
He's looking to establish some
sort of agricultural empire

20:06.880 --> 20:10.346
in Texas in the 1830s, '40s, and '50s.

20:10.348 --> 20:12.749
And he comes to Texas to make his fortune.

20:12.751 --> 20:14.150
He's carrying some bank with him.

20:14.152 --> 20:17.254
- He's coming for money, hunting for money.
- Okay.

20:17.256 --> 20:19.657
His main businesses were
down on the Texas coast.

20:19.659 --> 20:21.626
That's where his plantations were.

20:21.628 --> 20:23.295
That's where his slaves were.

20:23.297 --> 20:25.599
That's where his entire
economic enterprise was.

20:25.601 --> 20:27.900
So when we...
how many slaves did this guy have?

20:27.902 --> 20:29.903
- Do we have any idea?
- Yeah, low hundreds.

20:29.905 --> 20:31.138
Hundreds?

20:31.140 --> 20:33.474
And everything is really
on the climb for him,

20:33.476 --> 20:37.944
- but he bets big on the Confederacy.
- Oh.

20:37.946 --> 20:42.015
And, as you know,
the Confederates came in 2nd.

20:42.017 --> 20:43.517
So his money was all in Confederate money,
I guess.

20:43.519 --> 20:44.918
Correct. Correct.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.989
His slaves were emancipated,
and so at the end of his life...

20:47.991 --> 20:49.592
I mean, here's his obituary.

20:49.594 --> 20:53.127
At the end of his life,
he ends up essentially getting ruined.

20:53.129 --> 20:54.630
He gambled and lost.

20:54.632 --> 20:56.966
So, do we know what he died of?

20:56.968 --> 20:59.970
Probably died of a broken heart,
if you ask me.

21:03.340 --> 21:07.710
There's one thing that controls all.

21:07.712 --> 21:11.214
It already took down those people outside.

21:11.216 --> 21:13.348
I just keep hearing bad decisions.

21:13.350 --> 21:15.583
The thing that caused the issues here...

21:15.585 --> 21:20.287
this main nasty thing... makes people crazy.

21:34.507 --> 21:36.710
Now that I know my client's property

21:36.712 --> 21:38.713
was the site of a brutal Native American war

21:38.715 --> 21:40.947
and owned by a wealthy plantation owner,

21:40.949 --> 21:43.284
I need to see if there's anything else.

21:46.523 --> 21:48.289
Searching through the archives,

21:48.291 --> 21:50.288
I find a man named Otto Steffens,

21:50.290 --> 21:51.957
who lived on Sean's land.

21:51.959 --> 21:55.462
Turns out he was one of
Abilene's first millionaires.

22:01.506 --> 22:05.274
I actually managed to track
down one of his descendants.

22:05.276 --> 22:06.578
He tells me the second

22:06.580 --> 22:09.014
Otto Steffens landed on
my client's property,

22:09.016 --> 22:10.981
his life spiraled out of control.

22:18.656 --> 22:20.989
Clinton, thanks for meeting with me.
I appreciate that.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.257
Now, I understand the
property I'm investigating...

22:23.259 --> 22:25.596
your great grandfather owned
that property at one point.

22:25.598 --> 22:27.965
- Right.
- Okay, now, what do you know about him?

22:27.967 --> 22:31.703
He moved to Texas with
his folks around 1851.

22:31.705 --> 22:33.770
- Okay, from where?
- Germany.

22:33.772 --> 22:36.171
He was the epitome of the American dream.

22:36.173 --> 22:38.739
So how does he wind up coming to Abilene?

22:38.741 --> 22:42.645
He buys a bank from a man named Louding.

22:42.647 --> 22:43.814
Okay.

22:43.816 --> 22:46.922
- And do we know when that was?
- 1883.

22:46.924 --> 22:48.992
Then he moves to Abilene.

22:48.994 --> 22:50.895
In fact, this is pretty close

22:50.897 --> 22:53.364
to what he would have
looked like about that time.

22:53.366 --> 22:57.268
That's Otto Steffens.

22:57.270 --> 22:59.505
He buys a parcel of land.

22:59.507 --> 23:03.446
This is the parcel of
land in blue right here.

23:03.448 --> 23:06.749
Do you know where my client's
property would be right now?

23:06.751 --> 23:10.321
Your client's property is right here.

23:10.323 --> 23:11.956
- Where this dot is?
- Where the dot is.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.724
You mentioned on the phone
that things went bad for him.

23:13.726 --> 23:14.993
What did you mean by that?

23:14.995 --> 23:17.934
He became president of the
Abilene Fire Department,

23:17.936 --> 23:22.938
and the first fire they
went to was his house.

23:22.940 --> 23:27.410
They set up a pumper truck,
and it failed to work.

23:27.412 --> 23:28.945
And so the house burned down.

23:30.481 --> 23:32.648
So you weren't kidding
about his luck changing.

23:32.650 --> 23:36.584
No, it went from there even to worse
'cause in 1905,

23:36.586 --> 23:39.253
there was a failure with the bank.

23:39.255 --> 23:41.322
The federal government came in

23:41.324 --> 23:43.857
and pressed charges against
him for embezzlement.

23:43.859 --> 23:48.229
He was convicted on three charges.

23:48.231 --> 23:51.698
Louding was convicted on 18 charges.

23:51.700 --> 23:54.771
Now, during the appeals,

23:54.773 --> 23:58.844
Walter, his son, committed suicide...

23:58.846 --> 24:01.416
shot himself.

24:01.418 --> 24:05.186
So now the son commits suicide.
He's under indictment.

24:05.188 --> 24:06.888
What happens with him?

24:06.890 --> 24:10.889
Otto, with the stress of the trials,

24:10.891 --> 24:12.860
had a heart attack and died.

24:12.862 --> 24:14.863
And how old was he when he died?

24:14.865 --> 24:17.564
- He was 56.
- He was a young man.

24:17.566 --> 24:20.237
He was a pillar of the
community as an empire builder.

24:20.239 --> 24:24.308
And all of a sudden,
everything just went down the tubes.

24:28.082 --> 24:31.516
Do you know what this thing is?

24:31.518 --> 24:33.386
I know what it's not,

24:33.388 --> 24:35.655
and it's not a devil and it's not a demon.

24:35.657 --> 24:37.158
Was it ever a human?

24:37.160 --> 24:39.061
I don't think so.

24:42.397 --> 24:47.570
I can't talk about what it is right now.

24:47.572 --> 24:49.004
Why?

24:49.006 --> 24:50.771
'Cause I'm trying to protect myself.

24:50.773 --> 24:52.873
People worship it.

24:52.875 --> 24:57.679
If you use its name, it's like a summoning.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.519
During my research,
I noticed something strange.

25:04.521 --> 25:06.921
There seemed to be an
unusual amount of murders

25:06.923 --> 25:08.490
surrounding my client's property.

25:08.492 --> 25:10.392
Now, it's a small town, so it seems odd.

25:10.394 --> 25:13.463
I'm heading over to meet
with a local police sergeant

25:13.465 --> 25:15.797
who actually worked on
a couple of those cases.

25:22.096 --> 25:24.196
You mentioned on the
phone you actually worked

25:24.198 --> 25:27.298
- on a couple of the cases that I came across.
- I did.

25:27.300 --> 25:29.401
What can you tell me about the first one?

25:29.403 --> 25:31.771
The first one was the
murder of Geneva Jackson.

25:31.773 --> 25:33.073
Happened in '73.

25:33.075 --> 25:37.645
She was a schoolteacher for
the Abilene School District.

25:37.647 --> 25:40.514
Her body was found the 15th of December

25:40.516 --> 25:42.215
about 3/10 of a mile

25:42.217 --> 25:44.114
from the location that
y'all are investigating.

25:44.116 --> 25:47.221
I did come across that.
It's in one of my articles here.

25:47.223 --> 25:49.291
Okay, what happened with this case?

25:49.293 --> 25:51.626
Some friends found her in her bathtub.

25:51.628 --> 25:53.228
She'd actually drowned,

25:53.230 --> 25:55.066
but she'd also been stabbed multiple times.

25:55.068 --> 25:56.700
And is that an open case?

25:56.702 --> 25:58.633
- It's still open, yes.
- What else did you find?

25:58.635 --> 26:01.201
There was another one about
a little over a mile away

26:01.203 --> 26:03.006
that was a murder-suicide that happened

26:03.008 --> 26:04.873
where a married couple

26:04.875 --> 26:07.908
had had a domestic disturbance
at a local restaurant

26:07.910 --> 26:09.310
over some marital issues.

26:09.312 --> 26:11.181
Then when she returned home

26:11.183 --> 26:13.454
after getting off her
shift at the restaurant,

26:13.456 --> 26:15.122
he was waiting for her.

26:15.124 --> 26:18.623
Shot her eight times
and then killed himself.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.193
Any kids in the house, anything like that?

26:20.195 --> 26:22.698
They did have children
arriving home from school

26:22.700 --> 26:24.266
- about the time that this happened.
- Oh, geez.

26:24.268 --> 26:26.770
Okay, so now we've got an unsolved murder

26:26.772 --> 26:28.272
and then a murder-suicide

26:28.274 --> 26:29.941
real close to the property
I'm investigating.

26:29.943 --> 26:32.377
And there's a third one I think
might be of interest to you...

26:32.379 --> 26:34.546
a suicide from just about a block away.

26:34.548 --> 26:36.281
- A block away.
- Right.

26:36.283 --> 26:39.416
36-year-old woman in 1975

26:39.418 --> 26:42.422
committed suicide with a.22 rifle.

26:42.424 --> 26:44.821
Left behind four kids in that case.

26:44.823 --> 26:46.688
Was there any reason why?

26:46.690 --> 26:48.689
- Was there a note left? Anything like that?
- No.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.802
I saw several entities during my walk,

27:00.804 --> 27:03.604
but one is responsible for most
of the trouble in my house,

27:03.606 --> 27:06.006
and I got a good look at
it in one of the bedrooms.

27:06.008 --> 27:09.343
The child was in a bed.

27:09.345 --> 27:13.649
There was an entity that
was above the child.

27:13.651 --> 27:16.652
It's, like, hanging from the ceiling,

27:16.654 --> 27:20.288
and it has, like,
human eyes and a human mouth.

27:20.290 --> 27:23.026
This entity... is
he rather transparent?

27:23.028 --> 27:25.496
No, he's black.

27:25.498 --> 27:28.230
Is this what you saw?

27:28.232 --> 27:29.830
Yes.

27:51.208 --> 27:54.044
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:54.046 --> 27:56.144
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

27:56.146 --> 27:58.814
and our clients for the first time.

27:58.816 --> 28:00.547
Amy, I'd like you to meet Sean,

28:00.549 --> 28:03.746
his wife, Beth, and this is his mom, Wilma.

28:03.748 --> 28:05.918
They all live here in this house

28:05.920 --> 28:09.854
with Sean and Beth's five kids.

28:09.856 --> 28:13.124
- They range from 18 to 21/2?
- Correct.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.025
Sean's an Air Force veteran.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.726
He's done tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

28:16.728 --> 28:19.495
So this guy knows what danger's all about.

28:19.497 --> 28:21.531
When he called me and he said
this house was killing him,

28:21.533 --> 28:24.767
I knew we had to come and help
out and see what was going on.

28:24.769 --> 28:26.501
Now that Amy knows

28:26.503 --> 28:28.638
a little bit about what
this situation is here,

28:28.640 --> 28:30.441
I'm gonna ask her to tell us about her walk.

28:33.544 --> 28:37.449
When I got here,
there was this little, old man,

28:37.451 --> 28:40.654
and he was telling me

28:40.656 --> 28:43.524
there was a lot of fighting here, or wars.

28:43.526 --> 28:46.695
There were several different
ones over many years.

28:46.697 --> 28:50.702
It seemed, to me,
to start with the Native American issue,

28:50.704 --> 28:54.107
and there were all of these bodies.

28:54.109 --> 28:59.210
And these were all of the people
who had died over the years.

28:59.212 --> 29:01.377
Now...

29:01.379 --> 29:03.212
you had thought this was Native
American land at one point.

29:03.214 --> 29:05.346
- Correct.
- You were 100% right.

29:05.348 --> 29:08.081
The original Native Americans
here were called the Jumanos.

29:08.083 --> 29:10.250
And this is going back to the 1700s.

29:10.252 --> 29:13.721
But the Apaches decided that
they wanted to live here,

29:13.723 --> 29:15.389
and they attacked.

29:15.391 --> 29:17.391
And after the Apaches settled here,

29:17.393 --> 29:19.122
the Comanches decided they wanted this area.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.360
- Oh, man.
- So they came in,

29:21.362 --> 29:25.968
and the warring was going
on for over 100 years.

29:25.970 --> 29:27.769
They were pretty brutal.

29:27.771 --> 29:29.372
These guys were scalping each other.

29:29.374 --> 29:32.042
Then they'd eat their livers on some of them

29:32.044 --> 29:34.046
and dismembered them.

29:34.048 --> 29:37.016
A lot of people got killed on this property.

29:41.124 --> 29:45.295
I saw a lot of the dead
people outside the house,

29:45.297 --> 29:49.266
and I saw a lot of dead
people inside the house.

29:49.268 --> 29:52.403
Specifically,
I saw them in the master bedroom.

29:52.405 --> 29:54.840
I saw them coming through that wall.

29:54.842 --> 29:56.775
And some of them, actually,

29:56.777 --> 30:01.642
would get inside of the
mattress and be in the bed.

30:01.644 --> 30:03.979
These people were the damned.

30:03.981 --> 30:05.647
You can hear them.

30:05.649 --> 30:08.950
You know, like,
I can hear them outside in the front yard.

30:08.952 --> 30:11.152
You go look. There's nobody there.

30:11.154 --> 30:12.888
You hear them in here,
like there's people here.

30:12.890 --> 30:14.523
Nobody here.

30:14.525 --> 30:17.193
So this is, like, the kind of stuff they do.

30:17.195 --> 30:19.494
There are a lot of times

30:19.496 --> 30:22.796
that I'll go in that master bedroom,
and I'm there

30:22.798 --> 30:26.197
and you just feel like your
life is being sucked from you.

30:26.199 --> 30:29.799
And I feel like there's people
just standing around me.

30:29.801 --> 30:31.198
Like, they're just standing there.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.599
Well, they are.

30:37.472 --> 30:41.542
Everything that's been going on,
everything that's here,

30:41.544 --> 30:44.247
all of the people still being here

30:44.249 --> 30:46.615
from these wars and fights

30:46.617 --> 30:49.816
goes back to a single entity.

30:49.818 --> 30:52.753
And I'm referring to it as "The Dark One."

30:55.358 --> 30:57.256
What it does is it pushes people

30:57.258 --> 30:59.926
into basically damning themselves.

30:59.928 --> 31:03.294
This, to me,
is definitely the biggest issue.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.631
This Dark One affects you in many ways.

31:05.633 --> 31:07.735
One way is psychological.

31:07.737 --> 31:12.740
I got that it creates obsessive thoughts,

31:12.742 --> 31:14.410
promotes negativity,

31:14.412 --> 31:16.246
a lot of tension, a lot of fighting.

31:16.248 --> 31:18.316
It feeds off of that.

31:18.318 --> 31:21.787
In the master bedroom,
I heard, "Divide and conquer,"

31:21.789 --> 31:23.723
and that's what it's
trying to do to the family.

31:23.725 --> 31:26.160
You're being manipulated,

31:26.162 --> 31:27.929
and you're being influenced

31:27.931 --> 31:30.464
to create, you know, bad decisions.

31:34.094 --> 31:36.127
You guys have been fighting,
right, a little bit?

31:36.129 --> 31:37.860
A lot.

31:37.862 --> 31:40.493
Like, you just hit the nail on the head.

31:40.495 --> 31:44.596
I mean, every member in our family fights.

31:46.031 --> 31:49.267
It's just completely tense.

31:49.269 --> 31:52.270
Also, we make a decision,
and then we find out,

31:52.272 --> 31:53.905
like, "What were we thinking?"

31:53.907 --> 31:55.940
Mm-hmm.

31:55.942 --> 31:57.409
It's funny you say that because

31:57.411 --> 32:00.645
this land has had a history of that.

32:00.647 --> 32:02.547
People that wouldn't
normally make bad decisions

32:02.549 --> 32:04.050
making bad decisions.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.921
One of the original settlers
that bought your track of land

32:06.923 --> 32:09.421
was this guy Otto Steffens.

32:09.423 --> 32:11.421
You see what I have highlighted in blue?

32:11.423 --> 32:13.724
This is the track of land that he bought.

32:13.726 --> 32:16.163
That dot's your house.

32:16.165 --> 32:17.898
This is him here.

32:17.900 --> 32:21.098
He's a self-made guy, successful.

32:21.100 --> 32:25.240
Now, Otto was doing really
well till he came to Abilene

32:25.242 --> 32:28.676
and hooked up with this guy, Louding.

32:28.678 --> 32:30.179
And they opened up a bank together.

32:30.181 --> 32:33.052
Things started going downhill from there.

32:33.054 --> 32:35.186
His home burned down to the ground.

32:35.188 --> 32:37.388
1905... the bank failed,

32:37.390 --> 32:38.724
and then the federal government came in

32:38.726 --> 32:40.426
and they investigated him.

32:40.428 --> 32:42.263
He got hit up with embezzlement charges

32:42.265 --> 32:44.699
and all kind of bank fraud.

32:44.701 --> 32:46.267
So they went to trial.

32:46.269 --> 32:48.569
And after the first conviction,

32:48.571 --> 32:51.737
this guy's son went to Fort
Worth and killed himself.

32:51.739 --> 32:55.540
Two more trials later,

32:55.542 --> 32:58.709
appeal after appeal,
he winds up having a heart attack.

32:58.711 --> 33:00.911
He was only 56 when he died.

33:00.913 --> 33:03.079
Now, another guy that made a bad decision

33:03.081 --> 33:04.681
was this guy John Herndon,

33:04.683 --> 33:06.949
who was actually here before Steffens.

33:06.951 --> 33:08.951
This is him right here.

33:08.953 --> 33:12.988
He's a land speculator,
basically, in this area.

33:12.990 --> 33:15.856
Well-to-do guy from Kentucky,
came from money,

33:15.858 --> 33:17.725
made great business decisions.

33:17.727 --> 33:20.261
But the bad decision this guy made was

33:20.263 --> 33:22.628
he put everything he had
into the Confederacy.

33:22.630 --> 33:24.496
Well, he lost everything.

33:24.498 --> 33:27.165
He wound up dying broke and alone.

33:29.402 --> 33:32.472
How are you guys like as far
as the bad decision making?

33:32.474 --> 33:34.207
We have a lot of debt.

33:34.209 --> 33:35.743
Right.

33:35.745 --> 33:38.146
And then with the obsessive thoughts?

33:38.148 --> 33:40.682
- That's a big one for me.
- Yeah?

33:40.684 --> 33:43.518
I am OCD crazy with a lot of things.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.388
Not <i> you.</i>

33:46.390 --> 33:49.259
You're being influenced by outside forces.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.868
How else is this thing affecting them?

33:55.870 --> 33:57.971
It's also physical.

33:57.973 --> 33:59.307
When I was in the office,

33:59.309 --> 34:02.279
I actually saw a female sitting there.

34:02.281 --> 34:05.183
She could feel sharp pain in her neck,

34:05.185 --> 34:07.418
like all in this area.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.654
Wilma, tell them about the
thing with your neck.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.791
I was laying on my side in my bed.

34:11.793 --> 34:13.658
I happened to get a glance.

34:13.659 --> 34:15.761
It was a black figure.

34:15.763 --> 34:18.900
And I came down the hallway,

34:18.902 --> 34:23.172
and I could tell that it was bad.

34:23.175 --> 34:26.106
He touched my neck.

34:26.108 --> 34:28.274
It was so cold.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.810
- Yeah.
- So cold.

34:29.812 --> 34:32.782
And then he started breathing.

34:35.219 --> 34:38.324
And the air was so, so cold

34:38.326 --> 34:41.891
that my whole shoulder and
my neck was just frozen.

34:41.893 --> 34:44.230
When I woke up in the morning,

34:44.232 --> 34:46.768
here on this side and here was red.

34:46.770 --> 34:49.168
Well, this thing is completely capable

34:49.170 --> 34:51.068
of doing this, you know.

34:53.873 --> 34:55.976
And did you get anything
else from this thing?

34:55.978 --> 35:00.280
It does cause illnesses, muscular problems,

35:00.282 --> 35:01.749
stomach issues,

35:01.751 --> 35:05.951
breathing issues, and chest issues.

35:05.953 --> 35:11.393
Well, that's the main reason we're here.

35:11.395 --> 35:14.392
Now, Sean's 38 years old, okay?

35:14.394 --> 35:16.862
This is what he looked like
only a couple of years ago.

35:18.167 --> 35:20.904
What? What happened?

35:20.906 --> 35:22.771
I had a stroke,

35:22.773 --> 35:25.907
and then I had a massive pulmonary
embolism with multiple clots.

35:25.909 --> 35:28.811
And then from then, I have diabetes,

35:28.813 --> 35:31.583
heart problems, liver problems.

35:31.585 --> 35:34.222
I've gone to doctors.

35:34.224 --> 35:36.060
Nobody can tell me why.

35:36.062 --> 35:37.731
Oh, my gosh.

35:37.733 --> 35:39.668
And that's why he thinks that
this house is killing him.

35:43.638 --> 35:47.544
Unfortunately, one of the things that I saw

35:47.546 --> 35:50.511
is that it specifically is interacting

35:50.513 --> 35:55.750
with a child between the age of 9 and 12.

35:57.317 --> 35:59.752
She did have her hair back.

35:59.754 --> 36:02.721
It was brown, like, in a ponytail, long-ish.

36:02.723 --> 36:05.989
Her and this thing have bonded,

36:05.991 --> 36:08.326
so it's manipulated her

36:08.328 --> 36:11.795
into thinking that it's friendly.

36:11.797 --> 36:14.297
She's able to hear it.

36:14.299 --> 36:16.232
She's able to see it.

36:16.234 --> 36:20.138
Whenever she gets into fights
or she gets in trouble,

36:20.140 --> 36:22.709
this thing is like,

36:22.711 --> 36:27.048
"I'll take care of it. I'll punish them."

36:27.050 --> 36:28.850
The only one that sounds like is Rebecca.

36:31.417 --> 36:33.921
I think she has abilities.

36:36.826 --> 36:40.995
Becca and I... we clash a lot.

36:40.997 --> 36:43.566
I'm stunned. Just...

36:43.568 --> 36:46.002
I did do a sketch of The Dark One

36:46.004 --> 36:49.572
when I saw it in the child's room.

36:53.246 --> 36:54.479
What the [Bleep]

37:01.192 --> 37:02.760
Wow.

37:17.046 --> 37:19.482
I did do a sketch of The Dark One

37:19.484 --> 37:22.916
when I saw it in the child's room.

37:26.356 --> 37:27.889
What the [Bleep]

37:34.631 --> 37:35.730
Wow.

37:40.239 --> 37:43.240
Is it okay if I show her what you gave me?

37:43.242 --> 37:44.808
Mm-hmm.

37:44.810 --> 37:47.847
This is a sketch he did for what he saw.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.382
Okay.

37:56.492 --> 38:00.428
Oh, yeah.

38:00.430 --> 38:01.999
Mm-hmm.

38:02.001 --> 38:04.103
What is it, and what does it want?

38:04.105 --> 38:06.705
This is where it gets <i>really</i> strange.

38:06.707 --> 38:10.209
I knew it wasn't a devil
and it wasn't a demon.

38:10.211 --> 38:15.475
I am calling it "The Dark One"
because I can't say its name

38:15.477 --> 38:18.443
because that could put me in danger.

38:18.445 --> 38:24.374
This particular being is native to Africa.

38:24.376 --> 38:27.008
It's utilized in the voodoo tradition.

38:27.010 --> 38:33.576
Usually, how this entity comes into being

38:33.578 --> 38:37.513
is that a voodoo practitioner
will do a summoning.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.579
And the entity

38:39.581 --> 38:43.284
will then form a direct
attachment to the summoner.

38:43.286 --> 38:46.453
It will always be with that person,

38:46.455 --> 38:49.358
okay, for their entire life.

38:49.360 --> 38:54.131
And the family, then,
can inherit this entity.

38:54.133 --> 38:57.838
You have to honor it and respect it,

38:57.840 --> 38:59.439
and if you don't,

38:59.441 --> 39:02.943
it becomes very volatile, very destructive.

39:02.945 --> 39:05.881
So I'm very confused

39:05.883 --> 39:11.620
because this one seems to have gone rogue.

39:11.622 --> 39:12.988
And that was one of my questions...

39:12.990 --> 39:14.856
you know,
were there slaves ever in the area?

39:14.858 --> 39:16.124
Well, this guy John Herndon

39:16.126 --> 39:17.991
owned the property here at one time,

39:17.993 --> 39:20.093
- and he had over 100 slaves.
- Yeah, I think this thing...

39:20.095 --> 39:23.029
it had to have been more...

39:23.031 --> 39:27.827
I think directly, you know, somehow here.

39:27.829 --> 39:32.332
So how it got here I think
is gonna remain a mystery,

39:32.334 --> 39:35.699
but I know what I saw,
and I know what it is.

39:35.701 --> 39:38.734
And I know what it's doing. It terrified me.

39:38.736 --> 39:41.637
I knew, you know,
that things were happening,

39:41.639 --> 39:43.097
and I knew it was bad.

39:44.808 --> 39:48.745
I told him, "I'm old," you know,
"to leave my family alone."

39:48.747 --> 39:51.549
So what does it want to do to our client?

39:51.551 --> 39:54.585
It wants to cause destruction and mayhem

39:54.587 --> 39:58.156
and cause them to, you know,
destroy themselves.

40:00.525 --> 40:04.731
Well, Sean,
you served your country in two wars.

40:04.733 --> 40:06.666
You came home to another war.

40:06.668 --> 40:11.338
My question is is this a war
or a battle that you can win,

40:11.340 --> 40:15.907
and can your family live here
safely and normally once again?

40:15.909 --> 40:18.878
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.514
I'm extremely, extremely worried.

40:22.516 --> 40:25.117
I want you to bring in a voodoo priest.

40:25.119 --> 40:31.292
I want the entire family to
go through a ritual with him

40:31.294 --> 40:32.827
where he can protect you

40:32.829 --> 40:37.099
and remove any attachments that may exist.

40:37.101 --> 40:42.340
Now, you'll be protected
from this thing forever.

40:42.342 --> 40:45.675
The problem is anyone who's not there

40:45.677 --> 40:48.677
having this ritual done

40:48.679 --> 40:53.612
is going to be subjected to this entity.

40:53.614 --> 40:57.716
Any friends you have over,
any family you have over,

40:57.718 --> 41:01.320
this thing's gonna be
gunning for them big time.

41:01.322 --> 41:04.986
There's no way we can get rid of it?

41:04.988 --> 41:07.353
You might be able to knock
it out and take care of it.

41:07.355 --> 41:09.220
We can have hope.

41:09.222 --> 41:12.954
But if he doesn't,
you're gonna have to move.

41:12.956 --> 41:17.394
So when the voodoo priest does this ritual,

41:17.396 --> 41:19.360
will it help the dead people that are here?

41:19.362 --> 41:21.165
Yes.

41:21.167 --> 41:23.436
They're attached to The Dark One.

41:23.438 --> 41:25.604
When it's gone, will they just go?

41:25.606 --> 41:27.574
Oh, yes, they're gonna be set free.

41:27.576 --> 41:30.112
I believe it's intelligent.

41:30.114 --> 41:31.611
I mean, it knows what's going on.

41:31.613 --> 41:33.615
It knows what we're doing.

41:33.617 --> 41:36.452
It's preparing for... war.

41:36.454 --> 41:40.220
So here's the million-dollar question...

41:40.222 --> 41:42.189
are you gonna be vigilant
and do this or what?

41:42.191 --> 41:43.757
- Definitely.
- Mm-hmm.

41:43.759 --> 41:45.724
Well, I feel a little bit better

41:45.726 --> 41:48.861
that there's some hope
at the end of the tunnel.

41:48.863 --> 41:49.862
Right.

41:49.864 --> 41:51.429
Wilma, are you on board?

41:53.030 --> 41:55.533
It's life or death.
I mean, that's what I think.

41:57.734 --> 41:58.566
Sean and his family

41:58.666 --> 42:01.132
have an extremely difficult
fight ahead of them.

42:01.134 --> 42:04.070
Contacting the voodoo
priest is their only chance

42:04.072 --> 42:06.005
of ridding themselves of The Dark One,

42:06.007 --> 42:08.875
whose sights are set on destroying them.
