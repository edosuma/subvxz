00:06.106 --> 00:08.734
Gentlemen, behold.

00:09.142 --> 00:12.077
I have made love to this machine.

00:12.512 --> 00:15.345
And now, upon retrospect...

00:15.648 --> 00:17.377
I ask why.

00:17.450 --> 00:20.510
I'm sure someone thinks
that's pretty neat.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.815
- So you do that for science or...
- No, it was free!

00:23.890 --> 00:24.982
And she was drunk.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.549
She didn't know what she was doing.

00:27.727 --> 00:29.217
My metal boy.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

01:12.272 --> 01:14.866
Boy, sure is nice not having Shake around.

01:14.941 --> 01:18.570
Yeah, it is odd that he'd go down
to Guatemala and be a missionary.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.405
In fact, it's not true.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.846
Look here, he could be down there
on a prom date...

01:22.916 --> 01:25.282
with Santa Claus on the moon,
for all I care.

01:25.351 --> 01:28.286
The point is,
I can do whatever I want with my toys.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.618
- Put up your toys.
- Shut up.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.124
- Hello. Guess who's back?
- Oh, hell.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.093
That's good. How was your mission trip?

01:35.161 --> 01:37.186
- And where did you get that nose?
- What nose?

01:37.263 --> 01:40.323
- The one sticking out of your face.
- You mean the growth spurt?

01:40.400 --> 01:42.459
Yeah, it's common with kids my age.

01:42.535 --> 01:45.595
When you're a little older,
you reach something called "maturity".

01:45.672 --> 01:46.696
Look it up, wussy.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.264
It also goes by the name of "rhinoplasty,"
doesn't it?

01:49.342 --> 01:53.210
Yes, during my mission trip,
I had a small procedure done...

01:53.279 --> 01:55.645
so I can breathe better,
and hit the high notes.

01:55.715 --> 01:58.684
- And when do you sing?
- Don't be jealous 'cause I'm attractive.

01:58.751 --> 02:00.582
Why don't you
go back to your ugly room...

02:00.653 --> 02:03.121
and chat with the girl
you're afraid to meet in person.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.247
Leave her out of this.

02:04.324 --> 02:07.851
By the way, did you tell her
that you're a box of frigging... Thank you.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.725
Bonus! You got a goatee.
Yeah, that's in style.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.823
- All right. Fine.
- Like you got a dead rat on your face.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.494
You let me know
if those coconuts work out for you.

02:16.569 --> 02:18.935
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:19.272 --> 02:20.671
Can you tell these are coconuts?

02:20.740 --> 02:23.436
'Cause they spray-painted them
and they looked good when...

02:23.510 --> 02:26.536
No, you looking good, boy.
Them professional nostrils.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.137
Something about you.
I can't put my meat on it...

02:29.215 --> 02:33.151
- but you seem smaller in the nose area.
- Thank you. I am.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.052
Yeah, it would be great, too,
if you had some cheekbones.

02:36.122 --> 02:39.091
- You know, complete the set.
- What's that supposed to mean?

02:39.159 --> 02:43.255
Don't pin me down.
Your face just seems a little front-heavy.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.797
But you work
with what God gave you, right?

02:45.865 --> 02:49.392
I mean, nobody says anything about it,
but they are thinking it.

02:49.469 --> 02:52.165
Nobody says anything about me?
But why not?

02:52.238 --> 02:54.399
All right. Number 1:
Your cheeks are hollow.

02:54.474 --> 02:57.341
Number 2: You ain't got
no masculine cut to your jaw.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.878
I mean, you could be a man or a woman.
What are you?

02:59.946 --> 03:04.280
I gotta go back down to Guatemala
for some more cheap... Mission trip.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.046
- Lot of kids. Big trouble.
- When will you be back?

03:07.120 --> 03:10.419
That's really up to God now, isn't it?
He works through me.

03:10.557 --> 03:14.357
No one touches any of my stuff.
I am a man, damn it.

03:14.761 --> 03:18.060
- What did you say to him?
- Listen. Do you hear that?

03:18.598 --> 03:22.159
That's the sound of him not being here.
All right, you thank me later.

03:22.835 --> 03:24.632
Dear 69-So-Fine...

03:24.704 --> 03:26.729
sorry it took me so long to write you back.

03:26.806 --> 03:29.798
I had to pull some people
out of a burning building this morning.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.640
- I am back.
- You've got to see this.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.680
Get off the computer. Come in here.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.215
Come in here
and shake a man's hand, baby.

03:37.283 --> 03:40.946
- Damn, son. That looks horrific.
- Don't be jealous.

03:41.020 --> 03:44.080
I'll send a couple skanks
I don't want your way, don't worry.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.387
What's that on the side? That ain't right.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.893
Are you serious?
Just hold on a second, all right?

03:48.962 --> 03:51.829
- You better take care of that.
- That's what I'm talking about.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.991
- How's that look?
- What's pumping into your jaw?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.898
Natural spring saline.

03:55.969 --> 03:59.769
I woke up one morning and realized
I was going through the change.

03:59.839 --> 04:02.706
You should take sex ed.
Then you'd know all about this stuff.

04:02.775 --> 04:05.209
All I'm saying is
it just looks really infected.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.143
I'm not used to gravity feed system.

04:07.213 --> 04:09.044
You know how dumb I'd look
in a magazine...

04:09.115 --> 04:11.140
laying on a couch
with half-zippered jeans...

04:11.217 --> 04:14.914
and a chick holding a freaking saline
bucket over my head to feed my jaw?

04:14.988 --> 04:17.889
All right. I don't want to ruin your career.

04:18.156 --> 04:21.558
I just want to say that some antibiotics
might not be such a bad idea.

04:21.628 --> 04:24.495
Antibiotics? In Guatemala? Forget it.

04:24.564 --> 04:27.397
They give you a rat turd
with a little seasoned salt.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.868
No, I'll do the surgery there,
the painkillers here.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.164
If I did surgery, which I didn't.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.401
You're looking like a man's man now, boy.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.808
You gonna chop down a tree
and build a log cabin...

04:38.878 --> 04:41.176
so you can live off the land,
and wrestle bears?

04:41.247 --> 04:42.305
I'm thinking about it.

04:42.382 --> 04:45.749
I don't know how you'll see bears
with that fat sagging over your eyes.

04:45.818 --> 04:49.151
- Meatwad, don't.
- If he's our friend, we need to be honest.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.314
Here's a test. Now look at me, Shake.

04:51.391 --> 04:54.360
Can you see me through all the fat
drooping over your eyes?

04:54.427 --> 04:57.260
- Now that you mention it, I don't know.
- You can't.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.197
- Look here, you want your blue jean ad?
- More than anything.

05:00.266 --> 05:01.665
A blue jean ad?

05:01.734 --> 05:04.862
Look, Shake, a lot of times
the media tries to present an image...

05:04.937 --> 05:06.802
that isn't exactly true to life.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.398
- You understand what I'm saying, right?
- No, I do.

05:09.475 --> 05:13.571
I understand that some people,
Meatwad, don't look good...

05:13.680 --> 05:16.672
and that they should hide
from the cameras at all costs.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.343
It's the beautiful people
that are the smart ones...

05:19.419 --> 05:22.855
and it's that very same smartness
that makes them rich.

05:22.922 --> 05:27.222
People are different. It's not how you look
on the outside, it's the inside that counts.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.591
Thank you, Dad. I get the message.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.789
Is that what
you're trying to tell 69-So-Fine?

05:31.864 --> 05:35.231
- You read my e-mail?
- You think she gets you're a fireman yet?

05:35.301 --> 05:36.666
Screw you.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.202
Good one. Never heard that one before.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.967
Boy, do I feel burned.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.305
Look, you don't listen to him.
He ain't vain like you are.

05:44.377 --> 05:45.969
That's right. He doesn't know.

05:46.045 --> 05:48.570
What you need, boy, is to lose the eye fat.

05:48.648 --> 05:52.982
Get yourself some soft pillowy lips,
rock-hard abs...

05:54.120 --> 05:56.953
- and how about a giant brain horn?
- I know.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.151
I couldn't find a guy with the expertise.
I mean, look at me.

06:00.226 --> 06:02.558
This is my meal ticket,
you know what I'm saying?

06:02.628 --> 06:04.027
I only have one face.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.998
And that is another issue
that I wasn't gonna bring up...

06:07.066 --> 06:08.499
but I think you forced me to.

06:08.568 --> 06:11.537
You need a second little one
so you can do toy ads.

06:11.604 --> 06:14.971
You're right,
but I can't afford to go back to Guatemala.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.475
It's all fish bladders
and coconuts down there.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.535
We need someone who wears shoes
and washes their hands.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.979
Don't you worry, now. I know me a guy.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.041
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, yourself.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.451
Who's your friend over there?
He smells like Almond Joys.

06:28.521 --> 06:29.613
It's me. Shake.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.816
Did you get that done
in Guatemala or something?

06:31.891 --> 06:34.291
- Get what done?
- Yeah, he did.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.486
We're calling in the pros now.
Is your buddy out of prison yet?

06:37.563 --> 06:40.157
- Which one? 'Cause there's three.
- You know which one.

06:40.233 --> 06:44.101
The guy that was in the hotel
with the people and the welding.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.468
Terry. Yeah, he's out.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.702
But part of his parole
is he's not supposed to...

06:49.776 --> 06:51.801
you know, do what he was doing...

06:51.878 --> 06:53.345
- to flesh.
- We need him.

06:53.413 --> 06:57.406
Otherwise people are gonna look at me
and wonder what could have been.

06:57.483 --> 07:00.543
All right, whatever.
We'll meet at the docks at midnight.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.987
I get a 10%%% finder's fee. You never saw me.

07:04.056 --> 07:07.184
Fine, but I'll need a receipt,
'cause this is a business expense.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.990
All right, he wants you to drink all that
before you go in there.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.394
Easily done, my friend.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.059
Now you're talking my language.
What's this thing for?

07:15.134 --> 07:18.228
Yeah, that you'll bite down on,
so you don't swallow your tongue.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.999
- Now?
- You'll know when.

07:20.072 --> 07:23.098
- I feel pretty sure of that.
- All right. Hello, Hollywood.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.235
Let the games begin, baby.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.341
Listen to that. Goodness.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.883
- Boy, he's doing some work, isn't he?
- Yeah.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.477
I want that higher.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.956
Yeah, he builds hot rods, mostly.
Sometimes faces.

07:39.025 --> 07:42.290
We just thank you, Carl.
You've been real good to us.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.656
Just shut up. I need my money now.

07:45.264 --> 07:47.289
He's quick and relatively clean.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.731
You know,
this beats the jungle surgery any day.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.770
Snakes everywhere,
you can't get rid of them.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.966
I see he sold you
on the Tijuana Supremo package.

07:55.041 --> 07:59.171
You know, initially I was skeptical,
but once I saw them in the showroom...

07:59.245 --> 08:01.145
Come on. You'd be a fool not to get it.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.581
Let's go. How about you shut that off
before the cops see us, okay?

08:04.650 --> 08:06.515
Hang on. I'm still plugged in here.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.045
Frylock, get in here.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.578
I'm about to unwrap my present
to the jean-wearing populace.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.455
Are you sure that's wise?
It's only been a couple of days...

08:14.527 --> 08:18.520
- Right. I'm not waiting six weeks.
- As long as you know what you're doing.

08:22.535 --> 08:25.299
Oh, my God.

08:25.671 --> 08:29.129
I want you to contact Jordache...

08:29.208 --> 08:32.200
and tell them I'm on my way.

08:32.278 --> 08:36.145
What happened to your butt?
This is like a little shelter down here.

08:36.215 --> 08:38.547
If you add somewhere, stupid...

08:38.618 --> 08:41.086
you obviously have to subtract
from somewhere.

08:41.153 --> 08:44.054
So then they took your butt,
and put it on your face.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.250
- They did what?
- See this butt. It's flat.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.156
Actually, it's concave, isn't it?

08:48.227 --> 08:50.252
You got an ass-face, boy. Am I right?

08:50.329 --> 08:52.092
- You are right.
- I ain't talking to you.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.928
I'm talking to ass-face over here.
What you think, ass-face?

08:55.001 --> 08:57.265
How will I fill the jeans
if I don't have an ass?

08:57.336 --> 09:00.567
You ain't. You need to get yourself a job
making horror movies.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.801
<i>- Return of the Deadly Ass-Face.
- Fine.</i>

09:02.875 --> 09:04.536
<i>Never Go Back to Ass-Face Lake.</i>

09:04.610 --> 09:06.908
Fine. I won't do jean ads. That's simple.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.140
<i>Deadly Ass-Face Lake Camp.</i>

09:09.382 --> 09:13.011
- Need to work on that one.
- But I could do underwear, right?

09:13.085 --> 09:15.781
Flip over, shovel-ass.
You can do a hospital ad.

09:15.855 --> 09:19.086
- They won't have to use makeup.
- No! This isn't happening!

09:19.325 --> 09:21.122
- You're a sucker.
- No.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.394
What am I gonna... Frylock.

09:23.462 --> 09:27.057
You're into that science crap.
You can straighten this all out for me.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.226
I thought I was inferior.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.396
I don't know. Is the unwashed
allowed to touch the golden?

09:32.471 --> 09:34.598
Maybe this one time I could let it pass.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.507
- I won't tell anyone.
- Listen, it's one or the other, okay?

09:37.577 --> 09:40.307
Either you get your ass back
or you keep that face.

09:40.379 --> 09:41.744
I choose...

09:42.081 --> 09:43.378
the ass.

09:43.449 --> 09:46.316
You all thought
Michael Jackson was creepy.

09:48.788 --> 09:52.155
- Has he eaten yet?
- No. You can tell he's still depressed.

09:52.224 --> 09:54.658
Really? Is he out of my room yet?

09:55.695 --> 09:58.721
- What? I need my space.
- I can hear you out there.

09:58.898 --> 10:02.095
Maybe I'll get a Benetton ad
where they look for freaks.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.001
- Shake, you're not a freak, okay?
- Come look at this freak...

10:05.071 --> 10:08.370
I mean, yes, you have a pair
of large nostrils going down your back...

10:08.441 --> 10:10.602
- and they're running...
- My God. Look at that.

10:10.676 --> 10:13.144
- Fryman, what are you doing?
- Was he talking about me?

10:13.212 --> 10:16.306
- No, of course not.
- You missed it. It's a huge milkshake.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.713
- Yeah, he's like...
- I gotta go.

10:17.783 --> 10:21.719
- Please. Let me handle this, okay?
- Good, 'cause I gotta get out of here.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.948
Did you change something?
You look different.

10:24.023 --> 10:27.459
No, I'm the same.
How does this coat look?

10:27.827 --> 10:29.886
- Pretty cool?
- I'd loosen that belt.

10:29.962 --> 10:33.921
She'll think you ain't got nothing
down there but a spine or a snake bottom.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.197
She? Man, I'm just gonna
go run a few errands, you know.

10:37.269 --> 10:39.032
Yeah, right. Here.

10:39.105 --> 10:42.871
Say something about how bad the fire was
and you got your face burned up.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.705
- Play the pity card.
- Hello?

10:44.777 --> 10:47.712
- It's your only hope.
- Hello? Me?

10:47.813 --> 10:50.304
You better eat that soup.
It'll help you feel better.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.476
All right. If you think so.

10:53.085 --> 10:56.248
Little piggy, show a little self-control.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.780
Nothing grosses me out
more than fat people like you.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.487
- I'm fat?
- As hell. Have you seen yourself?

11:02.561 --> 11:04.461
I would not eat any more...

11:04.530 --> 11:06.691
unless you get rid of it,
you know what I mean?

11:06.766 --> 11:09.633
- What do you mean?
- I ain't talking about digestion.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.329
I'm talking about this.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.362
Meatwad, no.

11:14.305 --> 11:20.897
