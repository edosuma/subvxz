00:13.335 --> 00:15.435
Hey, we're going in 152...

00:15.460 --> 00:16.921
- On the right.
- Got it.

00:23.594 --> 00:25.209
Okay, Craig, you take over bagging.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.460
Got it.

00:26.664 --> 00:29.832
Lacerated forehead,
possible crushed airway.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.850
Jeff, dispatch said mass casualty.

00:31.875 --> 00:33.310
Only been on site a few minutes,

00:33.335 --> 00:35.297
but it's at least a dozen vehicles...
maybe more.

00:35.389 --> 00:37.889
We need help over here!

00:37.914 --> 00:39.523
Sir...

00:39.723 --> 00:41.179
Come here, come here.

00:41.204 --> 00:43.359
- I've lost my teeth!
- Gauze!

00:43.687 --> 00:45.031
Here you go.

00:45.056 --> 00:47.172
Okay, bite down, bite down.
Hold the pressure.

00:47.197 --> 00:49.571
All right, here. Let's move over here.

00:50.439 --> 00:52.106
There you go. Lay down.

00:52.155 --> 00:54.488
Casey has just radioed in.

00:54.701 --> 00:56.635
They're popping the
windshield on a minivan...

00:56.660 --> 00:58.007
Need medical on site.

00:58.032 --> 01:00.366
Red, thirty yards in, eye of the pileup.

01:00.391 --> 01:01.523
- We're on it.
- Go.

01:01.548 --> 01:02.523
- Jeff.
- I'm with ya.

01:02.548 --> 01:05.444
- Go back that strip in, got it?
- Got it.

01:05.704 --> 01:09.109
Choi, got a family of
four trapped inside.

01:09.318 --> 01:11.484
Lot of intrusion on the vehicle.

01:11.509 --> 01:12.975
All polytrauma.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.437
All right, we're on it. Adam...

01:14.462 --> 01:16.295
Got it.

01:17.542 --> 01:20.617
My son... save him. My son.

01:20.642 --> 01:21.976
We're gonna get you all out of here,
all right?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.656
Help the boys. Please.

01:23.681 --> 01:25.375
- Help them please.
- Bleeding head lac...

01:25.399 --> 01:26.842
Transected his temporal artery.

01:26.867 --> 01:28.370
Give me two hemostats.
I've gotta clamp it off.

01:28.394 --> 01:30.938
Copy.

01:34.211 --> 01:35.721
All right, I'm on the boys.

01:36.915 --> 01:38.664
Hang in there, guys.

01:41.043 --> 01:43.756
Almost there, guys.

01:43.781 --> 01:47.242
Help my... my boys, please.
Help... help my...

01:47.267 --> 01:51.594
Hey, Adam, need a C-collar.
You're gonna be okay.

01:51.619 --> 01:54.180
- Jeff, what do you got?
- I got some serious leg damage,

01:54.205 --> 01:56.673
- possible abdominal injuries.
- Let's give them some morphine.

01:56.697 --> 01:58.078
Can you get a read on body weight?

01:58.103 --> 02:00.000
I don't know... 60, 65 pounds each.

02:00.025 --> 02:01.867
- Push 4 milligrams IM.
- I got it.

02:01.892 --> 02:03.937
All right, take it easy.

02:03.962 --> 02:06.220
Just take it easy. Just take it easy.

02:06.245 --> 02:07.707
It's okay.

02:07.732 --> 02:09.835
Bleeding's under control.
Let's get him out of here.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.392
Okay, you hang in there, guys.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.937
I'm gonna give you something to
make you feel better, all right?

02:14.742 --> 02:16.535
Place two 16-gauges on the right,

02:16.560 --> 02:17.913
and let them know he's red-tagged.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.937
Jeff, stay with the kids.

02:26.591 --> 02:28.499
I got you!

02:34.280 --> 02:37.992
- Clear! Clear!
- Back up!

02:38.017 --> 02:40.183
All right.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.582
He needs oxygen!

02:43.607 --> 02:45.099
Need a backboard!

02:45.124 --> 02:47.024
All right, sir,
we're gonna get you out of here.

02:47.049 --> 02:49.904
Sir, can you hear me?
Try to stay calm, okay?

02:50.852 --> 02:53.286
Two, three...

02:53.311 --> 02:56.412
Pick him up.

03:30.355 --> 03:32.455
God.

03:38.391 --> 03:40.546
Hey! I need a little help over here!

03:40.571 --> 03:41.770
Pregnant woman!

03:41.986 --> 03:44.975
Hey, you there?

03:45.881 --> 03:47.739
Hey! A little help over here!

03:47.764 --> 03:49.097
Hey!

04:00.862 --> 04:02.416
Okay, everyone, listen up.

04:02.441 --> 04:04.322
- Glad you made it in.
- It wasn't easy.

04:04.347 --> 04:08.082
We've got a predawn pileup...
Multiple traumas en route.

04:08.106 --> 04:11.454
White-out conditions...
Staff snowed in at home...

04:11.479 --> 04:13.056
No supplies coming in.

04:13.081 --> 04:16.926
We need to make do with who
and what we've got on hand.

04:16.951 --> 04:19.017
All right, Dr. Manning and Halstead,

04:19.043 --> 04:20.418
let's decompress the ED.

04:20.444 --> 04:22.632
Anybody who's stable kicks
back into the waiting area.

04:22.657 --> 04:23.268
Copy.

04:23.293 --> 04:25.039
- Dr. Wheeler, be ready to glove up.
- Got it.

04:25.063 --> 04:26.946
April, we need every room we've got.

04:26.971 --> 04:28.671
Let's clear the hallways, supply room...

04:28.696 --> 04:30.350
Anywhere we can fit a
bed. Let's go, people.

04:30.374 --> 04:31.010
On it.

04:31.035 --> 04:33.344
Doris, put out a hospital-wide alert,

04:33.369 --> 04:36.314
- and page the triage team.
- Okay.

04:36.421 --> 04:39.217
Back to the waiting room?
I've already waited an hour.

04:39.242 --> 04:40.641
I apologize, Mr. Kellogg,

04:40.666 --> 04:42.766
but we'll get to you as soon as we can,
all right?

04:47.928 --> 04:50.261
What is the only indication for AVR

04:50.286 --> 04:52.797
in an asymptomatic patient
with severe stenosis?

04:52.822 --> 04:55.275
Left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.233
Correct, Dr. Bardovi.

05:00.677 --> 05:03.179
This patient is stable.
Close his incision.

05:03.383 --> 05:04.515
Why?

05:04.540 --> 05:06.693
We are expecting an
influx of trauma patients.

05:06.718 --> 05:07.616
Per emergency protocol,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.327
you and I will be in charge of triage.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.332
We need to ensure that
operating rooms are available

05:11.356 --> 05:14.023
to the most critical patients.
This man is not one of them.

05:14.566 --> 05:16.942
- Close him up.
- Yes, Doctor.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.140
All right, look alive.

05:20.165 --> 05:21.843
Here we go. Incoming.

05:21.868 --> 05:24.111
38-year-old male pulled
from his minivan.

05:24.136 --> 05:25.820
Mom and two kids are on the way.

05:25.845 --> 05:27.447
Here's the triage team.

05:27.472 --> 05:29.516
GCS 12, hypotensive.

05:29.541 --> 05:31.654
Clamped his temporal artery...
Belly's distended.

05:31.679 --> 05:32.671
All right, he's surgical.

05:32.696 --> 05:34.291
Stabilize him, and
get him up to the O.R.

05:34.315 --> 05:35.406
- Dr. Manning?
- Got it.

05:35.431 --> 05:37.493
All right. Dr. Choi...

05:37.526 --> 05:39.201
40-year-old male... GCS 15...

05:39.226 --> 05:40.704
Satting 90% on a face mask.

05:40.729 --> 05:41.805
- Dr. Halstead?
- Got it.

05:41.830 --> 05:42.875
No, I got this one.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.975
Severe burn...
make him warm, comfortable, and move on.

05:44.999 --> 05:46.468
There's nothing more you can do.

05:46.712 --> 05:48.945
- Naima?
- 63-year-old female...

05:48.970 --> 05:50.055
Went through the windshield.

05:50.079 --> 05:51.613
Triple zeros... Down
for nearly 20 minutes.

05:51.637 --> 05:52.515
Stand down.

05:52.540 --> 05:54.211
Thrown from a vehicle with
a high deceleration injury.

05:54.235 --> 05:56.546
- Most likely a torn aorta.
- We can't be sure.

05:56.571 --> 05:58.287
Regardless, asystole for 20 minutes.

05:58.312 --> 06:00.071
This is not a survivable injury.
Hold compressions.

06:00.095 --> 06:01.797
- Wait, let's warm her up first.
- Dr. Rhodes,

06:01.821 --> 06:03.727
understand that today we
need to focus our efforts

06:03.751 --> 06:05.918
on patients with the
best chance of survival.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.555
Please.

06:28.661 --> 06:32.641
I need Helene, my wife.

06:32.666 --> 06:34.466
Mr. Winter, we'll find her.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.060
Just try to relax.

06:42.432 --> 06:45.099
He needs an IO.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.604
Mr. Winter,
I'm gonna have trouble finding a vein.

06:47.629 --> 06:50.664
I need to put an IV in your leg.
It'll only take a second.

07:00.585 --> 07:02.885
- Dr. Choi, what are you doing?
- Putting in an IO.

07:02.910 --> 07:05.260
- Can I speak with you?
- Hang on, one second.

07:05.285 --> 07:07.052
- Almost...
- Now.

07:07.604 --> 07:10.534
I'm in. He's 95% TBSA.

07:10.559 --> 07:11.909
Calculate his fluid based on Parkland,

07:11.933 --> 07:13.115
and run everything through the warmer.

07:13.139 --> 07:14.434
Copy.

07:15.296 --> 07:17.628
I thought I told you to make
him comfortable and move on.

07:17.653 --> 07:19.320
Dr. Latham, standing
by while a patient dies

07:19.344 --> 07:20.598
is not in my job description.

07:20.623 --> 07:22.391
He has full thickness
burns over 90% of his body.

07:22.415 --> 07:23.855
There's no chance of recovery.

07:23.879 --> 07:25.884
He's awake, talking,
lucid, not in any pain.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.393
As you well know, he's not in pain

07:27.418 --> 07:29.684
because his cutaneous nerves
have been destroyed by the burn.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.608
Very soon,
his organs will began to shut down.

07:31.633 --> 07:32.832
He is going to die.

07:32.857 --> 07:35.424
And treating him will
only take resources away

07:35.449 --> 07:38.762
from patients who have
a chance of survival.

07:48.783 --> 07:50.701
- Maggie!
- Jeffrey.

07:50.726 --> 07:53.336
26-year-old female found
passed out in the snow.

07:53.361 --> 07:55.204
35 weeks pregnant... Vitals stable.

07:55.229 --> 07:56.629
Dr. Wheeler, you're
going to Treatment 2.

07:56.653 --> 07:58.770
- Got it.
- Stop.

07:58.808 --> 08:00.595
Green is not the proper designation.

08:00.620 --> 08:02.252
An expectant mother
always takes priority.

08:02.276 --> 08:04.553
- Is my baby gonna be okay?
- Don't worry.

08:04.578 --> 08:06.618
We're gonna make sure both
of you are taken care of.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.691
I'll get some blankets.

08:14.716 --> 08:17.748
On my count, one, two, three.

08:18.559 --> 08:20.897
They said you lost consciousness.

08:20.922 --> 08:22.779
- Do you know what happened?
- I don't remember.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.803
It all happened so fast.

08:24.828 --> 08:27.295
I saw a cut on my arm,
and I went for help.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.587
Next thing I know,
they're bringing me here.

08:29.612 --> 08:31.479
Well, your vitals look good.

08:31.504 --> 08:34.597
- What about my baby?
- I'm checking now.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.994
- Baby's heartbeat is strong.
- Dr. Wheeler...

08:38.019 --> 08:39.586
Traumas are coming in
hot. You done here?

08:39.610 --> 08:41.745
Let's get her undressed,
and put her on a fetal monitor.

08:41.769 --> 08:43.735
Everything looks good.
I'll be back soon.

08:46.119 --> 08:48.094
Pulled from the
minivan... This is mom...

08:48.119 --> 08:50.205
Susan, 38 years old, GCS 15.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.598
Right arm fracture...
Complaining of back pain.

08:52.623 --> 08:54.400
Son and nephew are coming in behind us.

08:54.425 --> 08:56.669
My husband, Blake... How is he?

08:56.694 --> 08:58.478
We've sent him up to the O.R. already.

08:58.503 --> 08:59.502
Belly's clear.

08:59.527 --> 09:01.399
Get her CT for head and TLS spine.

09:01.424 --> 09:02.893
Make sure there are no
vertebral fractures.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.877
- Take care of the boys.
- We will.

09:04.902 --> 09:08.236
9-year-old nephew, Josh...
GCS 15... vitals stable.

09:08.261 --> 09:09.394
Got pinned in the backseat.

09:09.495 --> 09:12.095
Bilateral femoral fractures... One open.

09:12.192 --> 09:13.494
His parents are traveling abroad.

09:13.518 --> 09:14.690
He's been staying with
his aunt and uncle.

09:14.714 --> 09:16.046
- All right, Dr. Manning?
- Yep.

09:16.071 --> 09:17.370
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

09:17.395 --> 09:18.916
I'm gonna take good care of you, okay?

09:18.941 --> 09:20.099
I'm gonna give her a hand.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.144
All right, you're going to Treatment 5.

09:21.168 --> 09:22.534
- Yep.
- Talk to me.

09:22.559 --> 09:25.212
Benjamin... 10-year-old son... GCS 15.

09:25.237 --> 09:26.361
Abdominal pain...

09:26.386 --> 09:28.248
Mildly hypotensive from
possible blood loss.

09:28.273 --> 09:29.744
Systolic 100 over palp.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.402
Dr. Halstead, red tag.

09:31.614 --> 09:34.541
- April.
- You're going to Treatment 4.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.556
My hips! My hips!

09:36.581 --> 09:39.037
Hang in there, champ.
We're gonna get you fixed up.

09:40.217 --> 09:42.918
4, here.

09:42.943 --> 09:44.135
Okay.

09:44.899 --> 09:47.901
Okay, on my count, one, two, three.

09:49.728 --> 09:51.461
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Yep.

09:56.802 --> 09:58.712
Breath sounds clear and
present bilaterally.

09:58.737 --> 10:00.268
Hang another liter of
saline on the level one.

10:00.292 --> 10:01.448
Yep.

10:01.936 --> 10:04.062
How'd you get to be so strong?

10:05.191 --> 10:07.159
You're doing great.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.189
Chest and belly clear.

10:09.214 --> 10:10.651
Okay, honey.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.424
BP 86 over 47. Heart rate 135.

10:14.506 --> 10:16.305
I know, I know, I know.

10:16.330 --> 10:17.708
Okay, okay, that's it, just breathe.

10:17.732 --> 10:19.314
Unstable pelvis and hypotensive.

10:19.339 --> 10:20.717
Close it down to stop the bleeding?

10:20.741 --> 10:22.853
Yeah, grab a sheet.
I need some help in here!

10:22.878 --> 10:24.447
What do you need?

10:24.472 --> 10:26.549
This might hurt.
Give him 25 mics of Fentanyl.

10:26.574 --> 10:27.799
Copy.

10:27.913 --> 10:29.799
Okay, honey. Okay.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.465
All right, all right.

10:34.665 --> 10:37.553
Okay, make sure it's tight.

10:39.365 --> 10:41.268
Heart rate's coming down.

10:42.453 --> 10:43.963
Bleeding's temporized for now.

10:43.988 --> 10:45.228
Let's get X-rays... Chest and pelvis.

10:45.252 --> 10:46.487
Let me know the second
there's an opening

10:46.511 --> 10:47.930
in interventional radiology.

10:47.955 --> 10:48.705
We need to embolize the bleeding.

10:48.730 --> 10:49.863
Got it.

10:51.713 --> 10:53.513
Chest and abdomen are clear.

10:57.516 --> 10:59.683
Cold foot...
I can't get a pulse on this leg.

10:59.708 --> 11:01.445
Fractures probably kinking
the femoral artery.

11:01.469 --> 11:03.603
- We've gotta reduce this now.
- Let's push two milligrams

11:03.627 --> 11:05.557
of versed and 25 mics of Fentanyl.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.383
Okay, Josh, we're gonna have
to do something right now,

11:07.407 --> 11:09.376
and I need you to be so brave for me.

11:09.401 --> 11:10.567
- Can you do that?
- Okay.

11:10.592 --> 11:12.393
Yeah? Yeah? Are you ready?

11:12.737 --> 11:14.537
All right, one, two, three.

11:14.562 --> 11:16.938
It's all done. That's it.

11:16.963 --> 11:18.963
It's over. Great job.

11:18.988 --> 11:21.174
All right, get a
post-mold splint on him.

11:21.317 --> 11:22.643
Page ortho. He's gonna need surgery

11:22.667 --> 11:24.446
to wash out and ex-fix that fracture

11:24.471 --> 11:26.236
as soon as we can get an O.R.

11:26.261 --> 11:28.305
Are you all right?

11:28.330 --> 11:29.550
Okay, can you keep
being brave like that?

11:29.574 --> 11:30.909
Dr. Rhodes...

11:30.934 --> 11:34.581
You are so brave... So brave.

11:35.588 --> 11:38.282
- What happened?
- I... I... I don't know.

11:38.307 --> 11:40.118
She was alert and talking
a few minutes ago.

11:40.714 --> 11:42.775
- No pulse.
- All right, Clarke, intubator.

11:42.800 --> 11:46.010
April, a milligram of epi.
Wheeler, get on her chest now.

11:48.519 --> 11:50.775
- She's hemorrhaging.
- Abruption from the trauma?

11:50.800 --> 11:53.138
That might explain just a vaginal bleed,
but not this.

11:53.163 --> 11:55.010
She's bleeding around her IV.

11:55.035 --> 11:56.971
Dr. Rhodes...

11:56.996 --> 11:59.497
All right,
likely an amniotic fluid embolism.

11:59.525 --> 12:01.993
Impact from the accident
forced amniotic fluid

12:02.018 --> 12:04.285
into her bloodstream...
Disrupted her clotting factors.

12:04.310 --> 12:05.674
Trigger the MTP.

12:05.699 --> 12:07.254
We need to get this baby out now.

12:07.279 --> 12:08.868
- Page OB?
- No, there's no time.

12:08.893 --> 12:10.275
We've got about four minutes to deliver,

12:10.299 --> 12:11.730
or we're gonna lose her and the baby.

12:11.754 --> 12:13.441
- Tubes in.
- Take over bagging.

12:14.340 --> 12:17.446
Okay, splash prep her abdomen.
Give me the knife.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.378
Clarke, pull.

12:37.416 --> 12:39.593
There we go.

12:41.483 --> 12:43.616
It's a girl. April, cut the cord.

12:43.641 --> 12:45.066
Clarke, start packing her abdomen.

12:45.092 --> 12:46.987
On it.

12:47.573 --> 12:48.971
There we go.

12:48.996 --> 12:51.771
Okay. The baby looks good.

12:51.955 --> 12:54.070
April, let's get her up to the NICU.

12:54.094 --> 12:56.081
- On my way.
- Okay.

12:56.614 --> 12:58.681
All right, Wheeler, hold compressions.

12:58.816 --> 13:00.456
She's in v-fib.

13:00.481 --> 13:02.548
Paddles.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.835
- Charge to 200.
- Charge.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.378
- No.
- Charge again.

13:14.816 --> 13:17.506
- Charge.
- Clear.

13:20.003 --> 13:22.993
Sinus tach. BP 70 over 33,

13:23.018 --> 13:25.026
heart rate 130, oxygen rate 95%.

13:25.051 --> 13:26.451
All right, set up a
Neo drip at a 100 mics.

13:26.475 --> 13:27.844
100 mics.

13:27.869 --> 13:29.432
She looks like she's
lost about three liters.

13:29.456 --> 13:30.675
How much have we given her?

13:30.700 --> 13:33.867
Two packed red blood cells,
one FFP, two cryo.

13:33.892 --> 13:36.032
Second patch is on its way
with more blood and cryo.

13:36.057 --> 13:37.323
All right. She's still bleeding.

13:37.347 --> 13:39.180
Tell the blood bank to
keep sending us O-Neg.

13:39.205 --> 13:40.448
We'll finish packing her here,

13:40.473 --> 13:41.894
and then we'll send her up to OB,
so they can close her.

13:41.918 --> 13:43.697
Right.

13:55.588 --> 13:59.690
Hey, Mr. Winter. How are you feeling?

14:01.902 --> 14:03.426
Cold.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.977
That's to be expected.

14:06.002 --> 14:08.166
The damage to your skin
caused you to lose heat.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.792
We have another warmer
coming in for you.

14:18.114 --> 14:19.847
Mr. Winter...

14:22.352 --> 14:24.406
You're in burn shock.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.118
Your organs are gonna shut down soon.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.453
I'm...

14:31.099 --> 14:33.002
I'm dying?

14:34.230 --> 14:36.330
Yes.

14:38.511 --> 14:42.215
Keep me alive till my wife gets here.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.646
I wanna say goodbye.

14:50.173 --> 14:52.173
We'll do everything we can.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.492
Mr. Winter,
your airways are starting to swell.

14:59.517 --> 15:01.527
We need to intubate you,
and put you on a ventilator.

15:01.551 --> 15:05.322
But I won't be able...

15:06.138 --> 15:07.917
to talk.

15:08.092 --> 15:10.181
When your wife gets here,
I'll remove the tube,

15:10.206 --> 15:12.120
and you'll be ab...

15:12.208 --> 15:14.475
And you'll be able to say goodbye.

15:22.384 --> 15:25.216
20 of etomidate and 15 rocuronium.

15:55.011 --> 15:57.878
All right, now for waiting room drama.

15:57.903 --> 16:00.012
His name is Jack Kellogg.

16:00.295 --> 16:02.061
Came in for a Xanax refill.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.755
How long you have to wait around here?

16:03.780 --> 16:05.563
Got bumped from his treatment room.

16:05.588 --> 16:07.269
Doesn't seem like an emergency to me.

16:07.294 --> 16:08.787
- Might just be hunting for drugs.
- He's fine, he's fine...

16:08.811 --> 16:10.496
But if you think differently,
I'll send him upstairs.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.318
Did he threaten to hurt
anybody or himself?

16:12.343 --> 16:14.610
No. He's just a pain in the ass.

16:14.742 --> 16:17.185
- I'll talk to him.
- All right.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.400
Mr. Kellogg?

16:19.558 --> 16:20.757
I'm Dr. Charles.

16:20.782 --> 16:22.434
I've been waiting for over two hours.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.286
Nobody cares. I'm just a number.

16:24.319 --> 16:26.183
I'm very sorry. We have a major pileup

16:26.208 --> 16:27.920
on the highway,
and we're in a triage situation...

16:27.944 --> 16:29.030
It's not my problem.

16:29.227 --> 16:31.886
Okay, well, what seems
to be the trouble?

16:31.911 --> 16:33.591
Cut the crap, all
right? Blah, blah, blah.

16:33.616 --> 16:35.513
- I'm out of my meds.
- Did you call your doctor?

16:35.537 --> 16:37.838
He's out. Why else would I be here?

16:37.884 --> 16:39.848
How hard is it for you to
write me a prescription?

16:39.886 --> 16:41.537
Well, we wanna make sure you
get the right medication,

16:41.561 --> 16:43.443
- the proper dosage.
- Dr. Charles...

16:43.468 --> 16:45.355
- Could you hold on a second?
- I'm sorry,

16:45.380 --> 16:47.153
but there's an emergency
in the psych ward.

16:47.178 --> 16:48.818
A patient attacked a
nurse. They need you.

16:49.224 --> 16:51.027
Mr. Kellogg, I'm very sorry.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.819
We are gonna take excellent care of you,

16:52.844 --> 16:54.522
but you're gonna have to
wait a little bit longer.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.589
- For God's sake.
- I will be right back,

16:56.592 --> 16:58.835
and I'm gonna make you one
of our first priorities.

16:58.860 --> 17:01.311
First priority. Yeah, sure.

17:01.336 --> 17:04.103
Look at me! I'm a human being.

17:04.127 --> 17:06.122
I'm a human being!

17:06.612 --> 17:07.743
A human being!

17:07.769 --> 17:09.046
Should we put him on a psych hold?

17:09.069 --> 17:11.505
No, he's not dangerous, just pissed off.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.740
Daniel?

17:12.765 --> 17:14.733
We're slammed and short personnel.

17:14.758 --> 17:16.625
I need to pull Dr.
Reese off your service,

17:16.650 --> 17:17.817
and put her to work here.

17:17.842 --> 17:19.329
Go to it.

17:19.631 --> 17:21.809
- Reese, with me.
- Okay.

17:31.347 --> 17:33.729
Heart rate's 150. BP 70 over 40.

17:33.754 --> 17:34.819
What are his injuries?

17:34.844 --> 17:36.622
Femoral fractures in both legs...

17:36.647 --> 17:38.993
Lots of soft tissue injuries.

17:39.018 --> 17:41.447
Looks like bilateral thigh hematomas.

17:41.472 --> 17:43.297
So blood's accumulating in his legs.

17:43.322 --> 17:44.573
We need to transfuse him.

17:44.598 --> 17:48.173
Yes, but first let's get a
liter of lactated ringers...

17:48.198 --> 17:49.722
Dopamine at 10...

17:49.747 --> 17:52.280
Titrate to systolic BP of 90.

17:57.149 --> 17:58.995
Maggie, need some help in here!

17:59.020 --> 18:01.120
Coming!

18:04.817 --> 18:08.185
Blood pressure's coming
up... 80 over 50.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.893
- 90 over 60.
- He's stable for now.

18:11.032 --> 18:12.269
Call up to the blood bank,

18:12.293 --> 18:14.467
and tell him we need two units
of O-Negative for this boy.

18:14.491 --> 18:16.088
I need the same for his
cousin in the next room.

18:16.112 --> 18:17.260
Okay, hold on.

18:17.285 --> 18:19.849
You're both gonna have to talk
to Ms. Goodwin about this.

18:21.814 --> 18:23.868
Because of emergency surgeries,

18:23.893 --> 18:26.889
and a pregnant mother's
serious bleeding disorder,

18:26.914 --> 18:29.681
we have used almost
all of our O-Negative.

18:29.706 --> 18:33.643
We can either treat Benjamin or Josh,
but not both.

18:33.668 --> 18:35.330
Benjamin needs an angio embolization

18:35.355 --> 18:37.042
more urgently than Josh needs surgery.

18:37.067 --> 18:39.235
How can you say that?
Josh isn't compensating

18:39.260 --> 18:41.619
for his blood loss as well.
He's in worst shape.

18:41.644 --> 18:43.151
I understand you're trying
to protect your patient,

18:43.175 --> 18:44.359
but you're being emotional.

18:44.384 --> 18:45.651
"Emotional"?

18:45.757 --> 18:46.923
And what are you being?

18:46.948 --> 18:49.002
Our recommendation needs to be based

18:49.027 --> 18:51.460
solely on clinical criteria.

18:51.485 --> 18:54.383
So I'm handing it over
to the triage team.

18:54.408 --> 18:56.608
Dr. Rhodes, your opinion?

18:56.755 --> 18:58.255
I have to agree with Dr. Halstead

18:58.280 --> 19:00.113
that Benjamin needs angio embolization

19:00.138 --> 19:01.904
more urgently than Josh needs surgery.

19:01.962 --> 19:03.648
Not the issue. We're here to decide

19:03.672 --> 19:06.032
who has the best chance
of survival, so...

19:14.242 --> 19:17.691
Unfortunately,
even if Benjamin gets the embolization,

19:17.716 --> 19:19.816
there's only a 15% chance

19:19.841 --> 19:21.608
that the bleeding in
his pelvis will stop.

19:21.633 --> 19:22.732
Exactly.

19:22.757 --> 19:24.024
Whereas with Dr. Manning's patient,

19:24.048 --> 19:25.771
as the pressure in his thighs builds,

19:25.796 --> 19:27.610
the bleeding will eventually slow.

19:27.728 --> 19:30.482
Worst case, Josh loses a leg,
but there is no question

19:30.507 --> 19:32.547
he has the best chance of survival.

19:38.865 --> 19:41.145
- I don't understand.
- We're very sorry,

19:41.170 --> 19:42.724
but it's up to you to decide

19:42.749 --> 19:44.517
which of the boys gets the blood.

19:44.610 --> 19:46.977
Decide who gets the blood?

19:47.135 --> 19:48.902
The doctors have their opinion,

19:48.935 --> 19:52.780
but it is a decision you and
your husband should make,

19:52.805 --> 19:54.560
and he's still in surgery.

19:54.585 --> 19:57.162
But, without blood,

19:57.288 --> 19:58.786
is one of them gonna die?

19:58.811 --> 20:00.396
It is a possibility,

20:00.545 --> 20:04.092
but we are gonna do whatever
we can to prevent that.

20:04.117 --> 20:08.416
And you want me to decide
between my son and my sister's?

20:09.165 --> 20:10.531
But how?

20:10.556 --> 20:14.035
Our recommendation is to give
the blood to your nephew, Josh.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.472
Josh? Why?

20:15.497 --> 20:17.496
Because he has the greater
chance of survival.

20:17.521 --> 20:19.880
- That means Ben...
- We are gonna do our best

20:19.905 --> 20:22.201
to keep him alive until
we have more blood.

20:22.226 --> 20:25.183
How can you make me do this?

20:25.208 --> 20:26.943
I can't.

20:27.441 --> 20:29.542
- I can't.
- If you'd prefer,

20:29.567 --> 20:32.768
we can make the decision on your behalf.

20:33.794 --> 20:36.507
Mrs. Porter, I assure you,

20:36.532 --> 20:39.155
we will do what's medically
and ethically correct.

20:52.523 --> 20:55.897
You'll be all right.
No, no, just stay still...

20:55.992 --> 20:58.381
Dr. Rhodes,
I hear we're running out of O-Neg.

20:58.406 --> 20:59.694
No, we have run out of O-Neg.

20:59.719 --> 21:00.843
Wait...

21:01.620 --> 21:02.732
Is this because of the woman

21:02.756 --> 21:04.210
with the amniotic fluid embolism?

21:04.235 --> 21:06.358
- Partly, yes.
- Dr. Rhodes!

21:06.383 --> 21:08.008
She didn't present with
any of the symptoms...

21:08.032 --> 21:09.633
No hypotension,
shortness of breath, chills...

21:09.657 --> 21:12.024
Wheeler, nobody's blaming you.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.775
I understand. We're
going to do all we can.

21:20.076 --> 21:22.718
Leah, there was a fella
out here before...

21:22.743 --> 21:25.410
- A Mr. Kellogg?
- That guy...

21:25.639 --> 21:28.204
Yeah, did you see what happened to him?

21:28.388 --> 21:31.555
Stormed out... Said he
was tired of waiting.

21:31.580 --> 21:32.833
You should've heard the language.

21:32.857 --> 21:35.024
I don't appreciate being
talked to like that.

21:36.594 --> 21:38.695
Yeah.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.600
His color's already improving.

21:45.625 --> 21:49.226
Heart rate's down to 119.
BP's up, 118 over 84.

22:12.110 --> 22:13.809
Albumin and platelets
aren't gonna cut it.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.201
- That kid needs blood.
- I know.

22:25.982 --> 22:27.715
Hey.

22:27.740 --> 22:29.747
We've contacted Mr. Winter's wife.

22:29.772 --> 22:31.848
She's doing her best to get here.

22:32.354 --> 22:34.544
Mr. Winter, did you hear that?

22:38.596 --> 22:41.030
BP's down to 80 over 40.

22:41.344 --> 22:44.184
Hey. Hey.

22:44.209 --> 22:46.154
Hang in there.

22:52.843 --> 22:54.676
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:54.701 --> 22:56.200
How's Mr. Winter?

22:59.596 --> 23:01.531
I'm sorry.

23:01.634 --> 23:02.900
Yeah.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.140
And I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

23:09.165 --> 23:11.594
but we're out of ventilators.

23:12.274 --> 23:14.235
- No.
- We've got emergency cases,

23:14.260 --> 23:15.852
who are coming out of
surgery, who need 'em.

23:15.876 --> 23:17.843
The... the only choice we've got

23:17.868 --> 23:19.992
is to take 'em from
our terminal patients.

23:20.017 --> 23:21.818
I can't.

23:23.064 --> 23:25.064
That ventilator's not
gonna save his life, Ethan.

23:25.089 --> 23:25.953
You know that.

23:25.978 --> 23:27.593
All he wants is to
stay alive long enough

23:27.618 --> 23:29.485
to say goodbye to his wife.
She's trying to get here.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.306
- Man, I understand...
- Look, in the field,

23:31.331 --> 23:34.336
so many times, a wounded soldier
will call out for a loved one...

23:34.361 --> 23:36.361
A mother, a wife.

23:36.386 --> 23:38.167
There's nothing I can do.

23:39.415 --> 23:41.212
Come on, man.

23:42.012 --> 23:44.212
Let's give this man his dying wish.

23:49.939 --> 23:51.972
I'm sorry, man.

23:57.078 --> 23:58.708
I can do it for you.

23:58.733 --> 24:01.232
I can take him off
the ventilator myself.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.580
No...

24:05.912 --> 24:08.012
He's my patient.

24:09.255 --> 24:11.088
I will.

24:31.033 --> 24:33.133
Mr. Winter...

24:35.081 --> 24:37.114
As you know,

24:37.139 --> 24:40.374
your condition is going to
continue to deteriorate.

24:43.294 --> 24:46.295
I'm sorry, but the hospital
is in an emergency situation,

24:46.320 --> 24:48.376
and I've just been informed
that I need to disconnect you

24:48.400 --> 24:50.100
from this ventilator.

24:51.789 --> 24:53.363
It's needed for other patients

24:53.388 --> 24:55.536
who have a better chance of surviving.

25:01.524 --> 25:03.583
I know.

25:11.475 --> 25:13.888
Here's what I can do.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.182
I can help you breathe manually,

25:16.207 --> 25:18.893
until your wife gets here, all right?

25:20.013 --> 25:22.373
April, pull the ventilator.

25:22.398 --> 25:24.031
I'll bag him myself.

25:42.295 --> 25:44.102
Thank you, Doris.

25:46.688 --> 25:49.622
I just told Dr. Choi to take
his patient off the ventilator.

25:49.647 --> 25:51.246
Right.

25:55.478 --> 25:58.358
Dr. Latham, don't you feel anything?

25:59.488 --> 26:02.923
Do you mean, am I empathetic?
Do I feel what others feel?

26:05.637 --> 26:07.545
Dr. Rhodes, one can lack empathy,

26:07.570 --> 26:09.624
but still feel compassion.

26:27.001 --> 26:28.300
Sarah...

26:30.027 --> 26:31.526
You liking psychiatry?

26:31.756 --> 26:32.855
Parts of it.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.347
Yeah, I'm thinking about psychiatry.

26:35.372 --> 26:38.515
I'm not sure the E.D. is the best fit.

26:38.793 --> 26:41.017
Let me ask you something.

26:41.618 --> 26:43.484
Day's got me a little stressed.

26:43.509 --> 26:47.111
Could you write me a
prescription for Klonopin?

26:47.136 --> 26:48.732
Um...

26:49.701 --> 26:52.342
don't you have your own doctor?

26:52.367 --> 26:55.725
Actually, no. I... I
never felt the need.

26:55.863 --> 26:59.410
I only want a few pills...
You know, take the edge off.

27:00.048 --> 27:04.016
Jason, I'm sorry,
but I'd have to ask Dr. Charles.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.722
Really?

27:07.784 --> 27:10.284
Hey, you know what, never mind.

27:10.309 --> 27:11.643
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

27:11.667 --> 27:13.100
It's no big deal.

27:13.125 --> 27:14.892
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

27:14.917 --> 27:16.384
Forget I asked.

27:24.307 --> 27:27.750
Wait,
do you wanna talk to his resident?

27:28.305 --> 27:29.971
Wait, he's right here.

27:30.090 --> 27:32.245
Dr. Charles,
the brother of that patient that you saw

27:32.270 --> 27:33.936
in the waiting room... The one who left.

27:33.961 --> 27:36.626
Jack Kellogg, great.

27:37.043 --> 27:38.454
This is Dr. Charles.

27:38.479 --> 27:41.047
Please tell your brother that I'm...

27:43.960 --> 27:45.711
What?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.540
I'm...

27:52.264 --> 27:55.098
I'm so, very s...

27:55.295 --> 28:00.096
I-is there anything that we can...

28:00.631 --> 28:02.731
Hello?

28:09.911 --> 28:12.599
Jack Kellogg shot himself. He's dead.

28:21.526 --> 28:23.369
Dr. Charles?

28:29.368 --> 28:31.672
I changed lanes.

28:31.928 --> 28:34.375
Next thing I know, we were hit.

28:35.703 --> 28:37.336
Truck came out of nowhere.

28:37.361 --> 28:39.828
I'm just glad you're okay.

28:42.937 --> 28:45.015
What about the boys?

28:50.412 --> 28:53.670
They're both at the hospital
and receiving treatment.

28:53.998 --> 28:55.732
Thank God.

28:55.757 --> 28:57.153
Josh broke his legs,

28:57.178 --> 29:00.443
and Benjamin suffered a pelvic fracture.

29:01.510 --> 29:03.444
Pelvis?

29:03.469 --> 29:05.302
You can fix that, right?

29:05.564 --> 29:06.963
I'm afraid it's a bit more

29:06.988 --> 29:08.896
complicated than that, Mr. Porter.

29:09.024 --> 29:12.044
Both boys lost a lot of blood,

29:12.069 --> 29:14.202
and both needed transfusions.

29:14.227 --> 29:16.327
However, the accident,

29:16.362 --> 29:19.732
combined with the storm
created a shortage.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.935
We only had enough for one.

29:22.709 --> 29:24.141
For one?

29:24.166 --> 29:26.567
Honey, please, it was
an impossible choice.

29:26.592 --> 29:29.426
I don't understand. What are you saying?

29:31.863 --> 29:33.696
You gave the blood to Josh?

29:33.721 --> 29:35.700
She didn't. We did.

29:36.241 --> 29:39.221
We decided that Josh had
the best chance of survival.

29:39.246 --> 29:40.979
Survival?

29:41.004 --> 29:42.604
What... what about Benny?

29:42.629 --> 29:44.729
We are doing everything that we can,

29:44.753 --> 29:47.169
- but he needs blood.
- Okay, I'll donate.

29:47.195 --> 29:50.463
I'm sorry, sir, but neither
you nor your wife are a match.

29:53.763 --> 29:56.068
- You must've approved this.
- I...

29:56.093 --> 29:57.444
I can't believe it.

29:57.469 --> 29:59.603
You should've made them
give the blood to Ben.

29:59.700 --> 30:02.739
Josh, he's my sister's son.
How could I just...

30:02.764 --> 30:05.365
So you're okay with
letting our own son die?

30:08.554 --> 30:10.254
What kind of mother are you?

30:10.319 --> 30:12.252
I cannot imagine the difficulty

30:12.277 --> 30:13.763
this must be for the two of you,

30:13.788 --> 30:16.255
but again,
we are doing everything that we can.

30:18.088 --> 30:20.287
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

30:20.697 --> 30:23.700
Sixteen critical, 24 stable,
seven treated and released.

30:23.725 --> 30:25.366
All remaining have been
accounted for and assigned

30:25.390 --> 30:28.014
- their proper designation.
- Thank you, Dr. Latham.

30:28.576 --> 30:31.579
Ms. Goodwin,
if Benjamin doesn't get blood soon,

30:31.604 --> 30:32.764
he's not gonna make it.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.193
Dr. Manning, we discussed this.

30:34.218 --> 30:36.085
I know, but I have an idea.

30:38.450 --> 30:41.118
So let's adjust her Ativan to Q2-hours,

30:41.143 --> 30:43.453
and with Q4-hour vitals.

30:43.478 --> 30:45.210
- See if that doesn't calm her down.
- Yes Doctor.

30:45.234 --> 30:47.034
Dr. Charles...

30:47.242 --> 30:51.028
um, about what happened
with that patient...

30:51.053 --> 30:53.101
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

30:53.277 --> 30:55.878
No, what I mean, um,

30:56.029 --> 30:58.569
is there was no way you could've known.

30:58.594 --> 31:00.567
It's emergency medicine, Dr. Reese.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.382
We make these evaluations very quickly,

31:02.407 --> 31:04.613
and these kind of things happen.

31:05.064 --> 31:08.129
Of course. I...

31:08.901 --> 31:12.135
I was just concerned,
because of your history.

31:13.742 --> 31:15.814
Look,
I have lost patients to suicide before,

31:15.839 --> 31:17.798
and I undoubtedly will again.

31:18.037 --> 31:19.970
I... I appreciate your concern,

31:19.995 --> 31:23.158
but it's just the...
It's the cost of doing business.

31:29.267 --> 31:31.367
Okay.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.103
Okay.

31:48.128 --> 31:50.229
Thank you.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.819
Good.

31:53.844 --> 31:55.610
Okay.

31:55.635 --> 31:56.971
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:56.995 --> 31:58.393
Came as soon as I could.

31:58.418 --> 31:59.930
Yeah. Replenishing the bank,

31:59.955 --> 32:02.129
and hoping to find a
match for your patient.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.230
Dr. Halstead jumps to
the front of the line.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.479
- Done.
- Thank you.

32:05.511 --> 32:08.050
- Thank you, Maggie.
- Don't thank me.

32:08.075 --> 32:11.263
Thank her. It was her idea.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.129
Paramedics just brought in a hemothorax.

32:32.154 --> 32:33.964
Dr. Rhodes needs you
to put in a chest tube.

32:33.989 --> 32:35.782
What about his wife?
Have we heard anything?

32:35.807 --> 32:38.102
She's stuck in the storm...
Still trying to get here.

32:38.127 --> 32:39.226
Then ask Dr. Rhodes to have

32:39.251 --> 32:40.688
one of the other residents do it.

32:40.773 --> 32:41.839
Dr. Choi...

32:41.864 --> 32:43.597
He just needs a little more time.

33:29.804 --> 33:32.648
I'm so sorry.

33:47.133 --> 33:49.366
Time of death, 15:37.

34:15.192 --> 34:17.327
BP's down. Heart rate's up to 152.

34:17.351 --> 34:19.830
- We can add another pressor.
- He's peri-arrest.

34:19.855 --> 34:21.636
His heart's working to compensate.

34:21.661 --> 34:23.132
We've tried every stopgap we have.

34:23.158 --> 34:25.847
Without oxygen-rich-red-blood-cells...

34:26.824 --> 34:29.159
I'm afraid there's nothing
more we can do for him.

34:29.255 --> 34:31.143
Ms. Goodwin, we typed
a few universal donors

34:31.168 --> 34:33.355
in the doctors' lounge.
What is taking so long?

34:33.380 --> 34:35.152
Everything has to go through the lab.

34:35.177 --> 34:37.547
If we transfuse blood
that hasn't been screened

34:37.572 --> 34:39.097
for HIV and hepatitis,

34:39.121 --> 34:41.965
we are in direct violation
of FDA guidelines.

34:41.989 --> 34:43.465
We'll just have to wait.

34:43.489 --> 34:45.105
Now hold on, I'm O-Negative.

34:45.130 --> 34:46.909
I'm screened routinely by the Navy.

34:46.935 --> 34:48.668
I don't know if military testing

34:48.693 --> 34:50.152
meets our standards.

34:50.177 --> 34:53.509
Please. If this could save my boy...

34:53.534 --> 34:55.878
- Heart rate's up to 160.
- Connect me to a bag now.

34:55.902 --> 34:59.013
We can push whole blood directly
through the rapid transfuser.

34:59.049 --> 35:01.016
Ms. Goodwin...

35:04.530 --> 35:07.541
Okay, do it.

35:13.238 --> 35:14.985
I put him in room PCHEN.

35:15.010 --> 35:17.087
Earl, I got your text.
What's the emergency?

35:17.112 --> 35:19.690
I found this guy holed
up in a patient room...

35:19.715 --> 35:21.688
Not even registered. Had his feet up,

35:21.713 --> 35:23.880
watching TV like he owns the place.

35:23.905 --> 35:26.272
Said he was Dr. Charles' patient,

35:26.288 --> 35:28.255
so I brought him here.

35:31.661 --> 35:33.406
But your brother called and said...

35:33.431 --> 35:36.343
It wasn't my brother. It was me.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.303
Dr. Charles thought you were dead.

35:39.328 --> 35:41.459
Well, maybe I finally
got through to him.

35:41.484 --> 35:43.740
Think he'll see me now?

35:43.937 --> 35:45.770
Mr. Kellogg...

35:45.802 --> 35:49.132
I am so grateful that
you're still alive,

35:50.240 --> 35:51.839
and that I get to treat you.

35:51.864 --> 35:54.475
- I just want my meds.
- Yeah.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.366
It doesn't really work that way.

35:56.391 --> 35:58.404
You see, your behavior indicates

35:58.429 --> 36:00.929
a pretty profound personality disorder.

36:00.954 --> 36:03.567
Off the cuff, among other things,

36:03.592 --> 36:05.483
I'd say you're probably
a malignant narcissist

36:05.508 --> 36:06.780
with overt sadistic impulses.

36:06.805 --> 36:07.972
You've got no right to talk to me...

36:07.996 --> 36:10.029
- Shut your mouth.
- Dr. Charles...

36:13.766 --> 36:16.100
- Maybe I should just go.
- No, no, no, no.

36:16.125 --> 36:17.752
I'm so sorry, but I gotta put you on

36:17.777 --> 36:20.736
a 72-hour psychiatric hold...
For your own good.

36:20.761 --> 36:21.847
What? Seventy-two hours?

36:21.872 --> 36:24.474
You wanted my attention,
and now you have it.

37:04.993 --> 37:07.476
BP's coming up. Heart rate's going down.

37:09.570 --> 37:11.823
Thank you, Ethan.

37:12.291 --> 37:14.050
Of course.

37:18.969 --> 37:21.336
Good news,
we should be able to get him up to

37:21.361 --> 37:22.843
interventional radiology soon.

37:33.654 --> 37:35.962
Susan?

37:36.896 --> 37:40.676
His father was right.
I was willing to let him die.

37:41.066 --> 37:42.489
No.

37:42.514 --> 37:45.724
No, we made the decision
to give Josh the blood,

37:45.749 --> 37:48.607
but that doesn't mean we
ever gave up on your son.

37:48.667 --> 37:52.154
I'm his mother. I
should've fought for him.

37:52.179 --> 37:55.440
What will he think when he finds out?

38:10.449 --> 38:12.409
Hi, I'm looking for my husband.

38:12.434 --> 38:14.267
They said he was burned in the accident.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.836
His name is Rod Winter.

38:15.861 --> 38:18.204
His doctor is not
available right now,

38:18.229 --> 38:19.895
but if you can wait
in the waiting room...

38:19.920 --> 38:21.652
Mrs. Winter,

38:21.993 --> 38:23.710
hi, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.848
I can speak with
you about your husband.

38:25.873 --> 38:28.181
Please.

38:38.060 --> 38:39.827
Blood finally arrived.

38:39.852 --> 38:41.987
Good.

38:44.361 --> 38:47.660
Hey, I'm sorry for calling you
"emotional" earlier.

38:47.685 --> 38:50.686
You know, you spend a lot
of time apologizing to me.

38:51.904 --> 38:56.381
Well... there are very few
people I care more about.

39:04.594 --> 39:06.928
Good night, Will.

39:06.953 --> 39:09.053
Night, Natalie.

39:28.002 --> 39:29.935
Snow's letting up.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.953
Supplies coming in finally.

39:32.383 --> 39:34.400
Rough day.

39:35.979 --> 39:38.525
I was glad to be back in the E.D.

39:40.813 --> 39:44.424
You can fix peoples' bodies,
but their minds...

39:44.801 --> 39:47.595
Whoo.

41:18.668 --> 41:21.122
I envied you today...

41:21.179 --> 41:25.982
Making those decisions clinically,

41:26.007 --> 41:29.154
not letting your emotions interfere.

41:30.071 --> 41:33.673
Dr. Rhodes,
are you saying you envy my autism?

41:37.112 --> 41:39.812
A little bit, yeah.
