01:40.800 --> 01:44.000
...in the bottom of the eighth,
a very tight game.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.700
- A hot day...
- It sure is today.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.600
It certainly is, Roger.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.400
Mets tying it up two to two in the sixth.

01:51.435 --> 01:52.965
Man on second...

01:53.000 --> 01:55.100
Want another super-nacho?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.800
No, they been sittin' too long.
The cheese is sweaty.

01:58.835 --> 02:01.700
This guy in the joint, crazy Rasta fuck,

02:01.800 --> 02:04.000
made grilled cheese on the radiator.

02:04.100 --> 02:07.100
He'd put the bread
between two sheets of paper.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.465
Had a whole system.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.865
What'd you do to your foot?

02:10.900 --> 02:13.200
The other night in fuckin' Irvington

02:13.300 --> 02:15.700
two black guys jumped me outside a bar.

02:15.800 --> 02:20.800
With half of them locked up grilling cheese,
you'd think there wouldn't be so many around.

02:20.900 --> 02:25.100
- Should I melt another batch?
- Nah. I'm good. I got dinner in the city.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.865
So, Finn,
you got any plans for the summer?

02:34.900 --> 02:38.200
Goin' back to Mission Viejo
to surf or whatever?

02:38.235 --> 02:40.465
I'm hopin' to stay here in the city.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.665
- How's summer school going?
- It sucks.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.200
I did summer school once.
You can still have fun.

02:45.300 --> 02:48.200
Casa Carmela?
He's looking at maximum security summer.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.100
Excuse me a minute.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.965
Why don't you cut your mother a break?

02:56.000 --> 03:00.500
She's holdin' this family together
during this current situation and all.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.500
- Can we get the check?
- The young man took care of it.

03:14.900 --> 03:18.900
- You paid the check?
- I figured since you're always so generous,

03:18.935 --> 03:20.100
I should reciprocate.

03:21.600 --> 03:25.100
Lucky you don't get your head handed to you.
Let's get this straight.

03:25.135 --> 03:28.365
- You eat, I pay.
- Mr Soprano...

03:28.400 --> 03:30.900
No, when you have your own family, you pay.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.800
Let's go.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.500
Just take the money.

03:58.900 --> 04:02.900
- I didn't mean to bite your head off in there.
- I didn't mean to overstep.

04:02.935 --> 04:05.400
I just wanted to say thank you.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.900
You're a good guy. I respect you trying.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.100
And then he fell asleep right after.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.800
He did call me late the next morning.

04:20.834 --> 04:22.865
And he sent flowers.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.900
But other than that
I haven't heard from him all week.

04:25.935 --> 04:28.300
- What'd he say?
- That it was nice, you know.

04:28.335 --> 04:30.400
And it was nice. He was very sweet.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.400
You think what happened at the party

04:32.500 --> 04:35.100
is an overture
Tony wants to get back together?

04:35.135 --> 04:37.300
I don't know, maybe.

04:38.100 --> 04:40.100
He's droppin' AJ off later.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.900
This is the last thing I need to get into now.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.000
Please, he never had it so good.

04:47.500 --> 04:51.100
- That's him.
- You two should talk. Let me just pee.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.500
So, was your father in a rush now
or something?

05:17.535 --> 05:19.300
No, says he was tired.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.600
And to give you this
and a kiss on the cheek.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.900
Thank God.
The last thing I needed was to talk to him.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.500
Know who loved golf? It was Joey Peeps.

05:48.535 --> 05:50.465
May he rest in peace.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.900
- It's sad when they go young like that.
- When they go?

05:55.500 --> 05:57.465
Come on.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.365
It was Little Carmine behind it.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.200
Payback for that whore of his...
Lorraine Calluzzo.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.200
You don't know that for sure, John.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.900
Little Carmine knew
how fond I was of this kid, Tony.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.917
I picked him out of the chorus.

06:10.952 --> 06:12.900
Schooled him when he was my driver.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.265
Anything from your cop?

06:17.300 --> 06:19.500
Some homeless fuck saw a guy limpin' away.

06:19.535 --> 06:21.500
Then he wasn't sure.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.900
I'll tell ya, I don't know how
I'm gonna get through Joey's funeral.

06:44.935 --> 06:47.065
And forget about Ginny.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.500
Every Christmas Joey'd send her

06:49.600 --> 06:52.700
a Grandma's of Maine coffee cake.

06:52.735 --> 06:54.417
What's wrong? You all right?

06:54.452 --> 06:56.065
- Is it his heart?
- No.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.600
It's this fucking weather, sudden changes.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.600
Fucks up your respiratory system.
Come on.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.100
- I got you.
- Get some electrolytes in him.

07:04.135 --> 07:06.965
We got you. That's it.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.800
Sit down. Good, good. That's it.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.800
You're all right. You're all right.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.800
The point I'm trying to illustrate is that

07:17.900 --> 07:20.965
of course no one wants all-out conflict.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.500
But historically, historical changes
have come out of war.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.865
As far as I'm concerned it's a new day.

07:27.900 --> 07:30.900
Old treaties and ways of doing things
are null and void.

07:30.935 --> 07:33.700
- Exactly.
- And the Joe Peeps thing?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.865
Where does that leave us?

07:35.900 --> 07:38.500
When you've had a quadruple bypass
like I did,

07:38.535 --> 07:41.165
it gives you a lot of time to think.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.365
The only thing Johnny understands is force.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.100
But the fact is, though,
we pissed on a bees' nest.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.300
What's the other option? Roll over?

07:53.900 --> 07:56.150
We could've had a sit-down.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.365
The other captains, maybe.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.900
This isn't the UN, Angelo. I won't let
what happened to my father happen to me.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.400
God forgive me, but you may be
a stronger man than your dad was.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.465
The fundamental question is

08:09.500 --> 08:12.000
will I be as effective as a boss
like my dad was?

08:12.100 --> 08:14.165
And I will be.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.365
Even more so, but until I am,

08:16.400 --> 08:19.300
it'll be hard to verify
that I think I'll be more effective.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.665
I just talked to my parents.

08:22.700 --> 08:25.600
They offered me a ticket home.
No economic relief.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.700
What'd the lady at student placement say?

08:27.800 --> 08:30.365
- I never went down there.
- Why didn't you?

08:30.400 --> 08:34.500
This economy, hello? I mean,
even the crappiest McJobs aren't there.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.600
I wouldn't want to take away a job
a minority could have.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.600
Just... It doesn't cool anything anyway.
Leave it.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.800
Don't open the window, the garbage reeks.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.200
Why do we want to be
in New York anyway?

08:49.235 --> 08:51.365
It was supposed to be fun, remember?

08:51.400 --> 08:54.100
Summer before the big push of grad school?

08:54.135 --> 08:56.800
You could go out to Jersey, sleep in comfort.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.100
Is that what you want?

08:59.135 --> 09:00.600
No.

09:01.700 --> 09:05.300
All I know is, I cannot go home
and live with my parents.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.800
I graduated.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.200
I mean maybe I should go back out.

09:17.235 --> 09:19.000
I can work as a PA for Josh's dad.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.100
At least I'd earn some cash.
You could come out for a week.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.965
Wait, wait, wait. What?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.400
He's a photographer.
I told you, he does major magazine ads...

09:27.500 --> 09:29.900
BMW, it's pretty cool stuff.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.200
- Is that what you want?
- No.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.600
- But at least I'd have money.
- Your thing with models.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.100
- There's no models.
- What?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.765
It's interesting work.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.300
As a career, actually, I mean...

09:44.400 --> 09:47.000
Josh's dad saw my shots
that won a prize in school.

09:47.035 --> 09:49.300
Said they were "solidly unsentimental".

09:49.400 --> 09:51.600
What are you talking about?

09:51.635 --> 09:53.800
Just blow off dental school?

09:53.900 --> 09:56.800
You haven't taken one photograph
in a year.

09:56.835 --> 09:59.100
You bitch every time I ask you

09:59.200 --> 10:02.000
- to take a snap of me and my friends.
- I'm just saying...

10:02.035 --> 10:04.300
I gave up junior year abroad to be with you.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.100
I know, and I wanna stay here.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.000
I could come out West with you.

10:10.100 --> 10:13.800
- But I have to blow off the law centre.
- Is that what you want to do?

10:13.835 --> 10:16.317
I don't know.
Do you want me to come out?

10:16.352 --> 10:18.800
- If you want to.
- No, you need to say.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.900
Maybe we should stay out there.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.200
You could transfer to UCLA.

10:27.700 --> 10:29.700
Fuck it.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.765
It's roasting in here.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.800
It's 10:30. We can go to a movie.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.000
- What do you want to see?
- I don't know, you say.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.300
No, you.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.365
Hello?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.900
Mrs Soprano. Lee Nieman returning.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.600
Oh, hi, great, thank you.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.700
I gave your secretary the broad strokes.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.000
You're in the middle of a separation,
the attorney retired.

11:02.035 --> 11:03.465
Right, Bob Greenberg.

11:03.500 --> 11:08.200
At any rate, I'm thinking it's time I move forward
with the divorce proceedings.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.965
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you short.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.900
- As far as handling it, I have to recuse myself.
- What do you mean?

11:18.100 --> 11:22.000
Actually, your husband had been in to see me
for a consultation last year.

11:22.035 --> 11:23.600
My husband hired you?

11:23.700 --> 11:27.800
No, but based on a prior meeting,
the code of professional responsibility

11:27.835 --> 11:31.300
precludes me from representing you
because of that consultation.

11:31.335 --> 11:34.000
He met with Greenberg,
and he wanted to represent me.

11:34.100 --> 11:38.500
Mr Greenberg would've found himself
in a bit of ethical soup had he moved forward.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.265
I don't understand this.
Why is my husband so picky?

11:41.300 --> 11:44.300
He talked to several
top divorce attorneys in New Jersey.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.500
You can probably
figure that manoeuvre out for yourself.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.965
Jesus Christ.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.500
I understand your frustration.
I can recommend a colleague.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.900
Someone your husband
hasn't contaminated.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.800
Well, yeah, OK.

12:05.300 --> 12:09.200
Accordin' to Johnny Sack,
the kid's brains were splattered over the seat.

12:09.235 --> 12:11.165
Joe Peeps?

12:11.200 --> 12:13.700
Couldn't have been too much to clean up.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.800
I heard the hooker
he was with got it in the chest.

12:17.835 --> 12:20.200
Must have been silicone everywhere, too.

12:20.235 --> 12:22.200
Why you always try and top me?

12:22.300 --> 12:25.000
You took the air outta my fuckin' punch line.

12:25.100 --> 12:28.800
Anyway, Joey Peeps' mom's a widow,

12:28.835 --> 12:31.300
she's in a wheelchair.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.400
Johnny's takin' care of the interment,
that shit there.

12:34.435 --> 12:37.400
So I'm thinkin' we should
pick up the headstone.

12:37.500 --> 12:41.000
- Jason, get into it.
- I'll call the marble guy.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.700
- What's up, guys?
- Frank.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.600
- Frankie.
- Talk to you outside?

12:53.100 --> 12:54.600
Gimme two.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.865
What's up?

13:08.900 --> 13:12.700
Turns out somebody got a look
at the guy that did Joe Peeps.

13:13.700 --> 13:16.200
All they got so far is he's got a bad limp.

13:16.235 --> 13:18.500
Long John Silver, maybe.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.700
Where the fuck do you get the balls?

13:21.800 --> 13:26.900
I am bendin' over backwards tryin'
to stay neutral, payin' for fuckin' car seats.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.200
And you're out there
actin' like a fuckin' free agent!

13:32.400 --> 13:34.400
Don't look at me like I'm a jerkoff.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.800
I'm sick of you leanin' on this cousin thing
and that bad hijack,

13:37.835 --> 13:40.200
like you can do
whatever the fuck it is you want

13:40.235 --> 13:42.600
cos you went away that night and I didn't!

13:43.200 --> 13:45.500
You keep bringin' that up. I'm fine with it.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.500
First of all, I had nothin' to do with this.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.000
- Don't fuckin' lie to me!
- If I was, would you really wanna know?

14:02.400 --> 14:05.900
That'd just be another problem
for you with Johnny, right?

14:12.000 --> 14:16.700
I know you're not earning what you expected.
And you got the twins, and Nancy.

14:16.735 --> 14:18.700
You're a capable guy.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.300
Your mother let it slip one time.
You got an IQ of 158.

14:24.335 --> 14:26.700
- She told you that?
- The week you got tested.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.700
All the nuns were raving about it.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.700
Lot of good it did me.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.800
I had high hopes when you got out.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.300
Yeah?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.900
Look, a guy like you... brains, balls...

14:39.000 --> 14:42.200
if you'd fucking be straight with me
I could use all that.

14:42.235 --> 14:44.400
Put me in, coach.

14:53.300 --> 14:58.300
All right, we got the casino on
Bloomfield Avenue above the hardware store.

14:58.335 --> 15:02.000
Carlo's guy was running it,
but he just got diagnosed with Hodgkin's.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.600
- That's mine?
- Yeah.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.665
A lot of fucking money there.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.800
I'll see what I can do
about getting you straightened out,

15:11.900 --> 15:14.000
opening up the books for you.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.300
It's long overdue.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.300
So I solved a major problem business-wise.

15:27.400 --> 15:30.400
Put a very good piece of manpower to work.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.265
My cousin Tony.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.400
You mentioned how close you two are.

15:34.500 --> 15:38.400
When we were kids they called me
Tony Uncle Johnny and him Tony Uncle Al.

15:38.435 --> 15:40.900
Right, yes. You told me all that.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.400
Anyway, a very smart guy.
He's got an IQ of 158.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.100
Do you put a lot of stock into that number?

15:47.135 --> 15:49.700
Why, are you gonna tell me it's bullshit?

15:51.500 --> 15:54.300
Cos I took that test and somebody gets a 158,

15:54.335 --> 15:56.300
well, they know a few things.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.400
So we can assume you think
he's smarter than you.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.500
Honestly, I think he's smarter than you

16:01.600 --> 16:04.065
the way you keep shitting on the test.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.700
But I'm no gabadotz myself.
This was a good move.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.300
Carmela and I slept together.

16:17.100 --> 16:20.700
- What was that like?
- It was nice.

16:20.735 --> 16:23.700
It was very... erotic.

16:25.700 --> 16:29.400
She was wearing that perfume that she wears.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.800
Poor thing was starved for it, honestly.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.500
I'm the only man she's ever been with.

16:39.535 --> 16:41.100
Did you discuss it?

16:42.300 --> 16:44.700
Nah, I left before she woke up.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.400
How come?

16:48.400 --> 16:52.000
If she woke up and I was there
it would send mixed signals, you know.

16:52.035 --> 16:55.300
I'm not sure that's the best...

16:59.000 --> 17:00.200
Yeah.

17:02.200 --> 17:05.565
No. Tell him I got fax machines
coming out of my ass.

17:05.599 --> 17:11.300
And would you characterise
the separation thus far as amicable?

17:11.400 --> 17:13.665
It's barely civil.

17:13.700 --> 17:18.000
Yeah, there are moments
when old habits kick in. And feelings.

17:18.099 --> 17:22.099
But he is not the person
I want to spend the rest of my life with.

17:22.135 --> 17:24.865
Fair enough. As for the assets...

17:24.900 --> 17:27.599
you've given me your tax returns
and investments?

17:27.700 --> 17:30.600
The house is in my name. Not the boat.

17:30.700 --> 17:34.065
- That's the Stugots, is it?
- Yes.

17:34.100 --> 17:37.500
I'm a little concerned that the returns
don't reflect everything.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.900
There is other income, there's a lot more.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.765
- Unreported income?
- Yes.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.600
And this other income,
is it from an illegal stream?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.800
No, of course not.

17:49.900 --> 17:53.900
But he does deal in cash, my husband.
The carting business.

17:53.935 --> 17:56.900
- I see.
- Is that a problem?

17:57.000 --> 18:02.700
I handled a case once
where the husband owned vending machines.

18:02.800 --> 18:07.100
I used a forensic accountant
to reconstruct his finances.

18:07.200 --> 18:13.000
In less than a week,
he outlined 11 years of income.

18:13.035 --> 18:15.000
And we're talking coins.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.600
Hey, you. Busy day?

18:22.100 --> 18:26.000
I dropped off an application
at the Cineplex on Broadway.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.800
Stopped by my dad's.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.300
He got you a job working construction.

18:30.335 --> 18:33.065
Construction? That's awesome.

18:33.100 --> 18:36.300
It's in Jersey, though.
You'll have to take the PATH train.

18:36.335 --> 18:38.465
Fine, no problem.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.265
But the most I ever did, though,
is help my dad paint.

18:42.300 --> 18:46.000
He said you don't need experience.
You'll be a labourer or something.

18:46.035 --> 18:50.100
- Pays like 20 bucks an hour.
- Holy shit.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.200
How is that even possible?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.365
You believe these fucking Blue Jays?

19:04.400 --> 19:07.600
Last inning I screamed so loud
my wife thought I had a heart attack.

19:07.635 --> 19:09.165
Why, what happened?

19:09.200 --> 19:11.950
Burrell got shelled. It was beautiful.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.542
- What are you, a Met fan?
- Padres.

19:14.577 --> 19:16.738
- Padres?
- I'm from California.

19:16.773 --> 19:18.865
I gotta go make my collections.

19:18.900 --> 19:22.300
Stick with the Angels.
The Pads haven't had a team in 20 years.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.900
What do you mean?
They were in the Series in '98.

19:24.935 --> 19:27.100
Yanks in four, I was there.

19:32.500 --> 19:36.700
Hey, Shaggy, grab a bucket
and some Lysol. Scrub off my tyres.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.950
There's fuckin' dogshit by the entrance.

19:38.985 --> 19:41.100
I'm supposed to be picking up scrap.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.800
You'll be pickin' up your teeth
in another second.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.300
DeTrolio, you need somethin' to do?

19:46.400 --> 19:48.100
Get fuckin' lost!

19:48.135 --> 19:49.800
Come on, guys.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.300
Go! Before it sets in the treads!

19:57.700 --> 19:59.900
My checks come in yet?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.965
I don't know. I didn't see the girl.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.700
If she ain't got them, send Meadow's friend
when he's done with your car.

20:05.735 --> 20:08.267
Who Meadow? What are you talking about?

20:08.302 --> 20:10.800
Meadow Soprano. That's her boyfriend.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.600
There he is.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.565
I can't find any Lysol.

20:17.600 --> 20:21.300
Don't worry about it. Why didn't you
tell me you were datin' my niece?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.900
Here.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.300
You take her someplace nice.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.500
Tell her it's from Uncle Paulie.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.700
Thank you, I... That's really nice.

20:33.735 --> 20:36.667
Here. Gimme that shit.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.600
Paulie! Come here.

20:39.635 --> 20:41.600
Get the hose.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.400
Sorry I'm late.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.200
- You been waiting long?
- Not really.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.465
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

21:00.500 --> 21:03.565
Well, I don't know
if you're gonna see it that way.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.700
I have asked you to lunch
to tell you I'm filing for divorce.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.600
I hope you brought your appetite.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.400
Why don't you give us a minute?

21:21.800 --> 21:24.200
That's nice.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.000
Invite me to a...

21:27.100 --> 21:30.300
public place so you could ambush me.

21:31.200 --> 21:35.500
- Do you think I won't make a scene?
- Spare me your outrage, Tony.

21:35.535 --> 21:37.800
Accept that I am moving on with my life.

21:37.835 --> 21:40.100
Moving on?

21:40.200 --> 21:42.565
That's what you were doing after the party?

21:42.600 --> 21:45.200
You and I both know that didn't change
anything.

21:45.235 --> 21:47.800
We're Italian, we don't believe in divorce.

21:47.900 --> 21:50.500
We believe in the nuclear family.

21:50.535 --> 21:52.100
Will you listen to yourself?

21:54.700 --> 21:57.600
And despite your best efforts,

21:58.500 --> 22:03.100
I have an attorney who is going to aggressively
pursue my custody of AJ

22:03.135 --> 22:06.200
and also an equitable distribution
of our assets.

22:06.235 --> 22:07.765
Our assets?

22:07.800 --> 22:11.600
I am through trying to get you to provide
beyond the minimum I need to live.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.365
So it's fucking money. That's all this is to you?

22:14.400 --> 22:17.800
After all we've been through,
is it so hard to own up to anything

22:17.835 --> 22:19.800
beyond that bullshit tax return?

22:23.600 --> 22:26.300
Go stand over there.
I'll call you when I'm ready.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.465
You want money?

22:31.500 --> 22:33.765
My 40 grand you stole out of the bird feeder?

22:33.800 --> 22:36.550
It should be plenty.
You're an investment genius.

22:36.585 --> 22:39.300
You want this to get ugly?
These guys live for that.

22:39.335 --> 22:41.200
You think I don't?

22:48.100 --> 22:51.150
The only reason you have anything
is because of my sweat.

22:51.185 --> 22:54.200
And you knew every step of the way
exactly how it works.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.500
But you walk around that fucking mansion

22:56.600 --> 22:59.165
in your $500 shoes and your diamond rings

22:59.200 --> 23:02.000
and you act
like butter wouldn't melt in your mouth.

23:02.100 --> 23:05.200
And you don't want it to get ugly? Too late.

23:05.235 --> 23:07.700
I want what I am entitled to.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.000
You're entitled to shit.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.500
She's ready to order.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.265
I guess we get along.

23:23.300 --> 23:24.965
We're just different, you know.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.965
She zigs, I zag. That kind of thing.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.400
- What's her dad like? He's always flirting.
- He's OK. A little intense sometimes.

23:39.900 --> 23:43.100
The main thing's that he's a good person.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.400
- So, you guys gonna get married or what?
- Living together's the same thing.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.665
I lived with a guy once and trust me,

23:52.700 --> 23:55.000
it's not even close to being the same thing.

23:55.035 --> 23:57.265
- What do you mean? Why?
- Cos.

23:57.300 --> 24:00.600
You could just pack up and leave
whenever the shit hits the fan.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.065
Talk to married people.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.565
That ring, believe it or not,

24:05.600 --> 24:08.400
it's got this kind of, like, weird power.

24:08.435 --> 24:11.200
So, what happened with you and this guy?

24:11.235 --> 24:14.000
- Phineas, my boy!
- Hey.

24:14.100 --> 24:15.965
It's actually just Finn.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.200
So, the Cubbies gave
your boys a shellacking last night.

24:19.235 --> 24:21.565
- It's still early.
- That's true.

24:21.600 --> 24:25.000
You know who he looks like?
That guy from Aerosmith, Joe Perry.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.600
- Your boss inside?
- Yeah.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.600
All right. I'll see youse around.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.700
All right.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.300
He seems like a nice guy.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.900
Yeah. They all are, pretty much.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.200
So you dating anybody now?

24:52.200 --> 24:54.100
It's cute.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.365
It's a lot of money for not much shirt.

24:56.400 --> 24:59.965
- Relax, I'll put it on my own card.
- Damn right you will.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Ask your father. He stopped paying my bills.

25:04.035 --> 25:07.600
Daddy? You guys looked pretty chummy
in the pool that night.

25:07.635 --> 25:10.700
He went home with Artie.
They helped me clean up.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.800
I have decided to move ahead with the divorce.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.200
- What are you gonna do?
- About what?

25:24.235 --> 25:26.765
- Life, I don't know.
- What can I do?

25:26.800 --> 25:29.700
Haven't you thought
beyond being dependent on a man?

25:29.800 --> 25:31.565
It's so simple for you.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.800
Simple for people who don't expect things
to be handed to them.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.500
Even Finn got a job working construction.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.565
Good for Finn, then.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.365
There are options in life.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.750
Isn't that what you always told me?

25:43.785 --> 25:46.100
You have options. I have a lawyer.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.165
Phineas!

25:59.200 --> 26:02.100
He was just asking. How come a dentist?

26:02.135 --> 26:04.667
What's wrong with being a regular doctor?

26:04.702 --> 26:07.200
I saw this thing on shark teeth as a kid.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.465
Hey, Phil.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.000
Glad you're not exerting yourself in the heat.

26:12.035 --> 26:14.265
Course. Now he comes.

26:14.300 --> 26:18.500
Soon as the Jersey tomatoes are in season,
you can't keep these New York guys away.

26:18.600 --> 26:22.300
Fuck the tomatoes, I'll take the escarole.
You know my brother Billy?

26:22.335 --> 26:25.000
- Yeah, what do you say, Bill?
- How you doing?

26:25.035 --> 26:26.865
- Hey, Felicia?
- What?

26:26.900 --> 26:30.300
- Those cases of toner come in yet?
- Yeah, it's in the trailer.

26:30.335 --> 26:33.000
I'm gonna gas up. I'll be right back.

26:34.300 --> 26:37.900
Toner cartridges now?
They're not skimming enough from this job?

26:37.935 --> 26:40.000
Brother sells them out of his trunk.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.665
- Jesus.
- So, Patsy, the necklace.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.300
- How'd it go with the goomah?
- Beautiful.

26:45.335 --> 26:47.865
With the little emeralds? She fucking loved it.

26:47.900 --> 26:50.900
First he gave her the emeralds,
then he gave her the pearls.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.900
I got Ebel watches, too.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.750
Earrings, whatever you need.

26:55.785 --> 26:57.500
My girl's birthday's coming up.

26:57.600 --> 27:01.900
- Some rack on that girl.
- Yeah, if you can get past the sideburns.

27:03.100 --> 27:05.465
You should talk.
That skank I saw you with?

27:05.500 --> 27:09.300
This girl's fucking moustache...
must've been like kissing a fireman.

27:09.335 --> 27:11.800
Well, you ought to know, sweetie.

27:13.900 --> 27:19.100
- What'd you say?
- Nothing, what? We're just breaking balls.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.565
Finn, what time's that game tonight?

27:22.600 --> 27:26.300
- 8:00, I think.
- I'm gonna take a piss.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.600
Do me a favour. Hold this.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.150
I knew that was coming!

27:35.185 --> 27:36.565
- My eye!
- Your eye?

27:36.600 --> 27:39.800
I'm sorry.
I meant to hit you in the fucking mouth!

27:41.000 --> 27:42.600
Gene, Gene, relax.

27:42.700 --> 27:44.900
- You OK?
- All right.

27:44.935 --> 27:47.200
Come on.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.400
You made your point.

27:50.500 --> 27:54.400
- Felicia, call an ambulance.
- Use your own phone, I'm busy.

27:54.435 --> 27:56.465
You been sick all day. Take the day off.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.800
What about him?
One of these civilians calls the cops?

27:59.835 --> 28:03.100
What? I think I seen
a couple of niggers running that way.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.865
Yeah, those two guys.

28:04.900 --> 28:08.300
Need to rest?
You want some water? You sure?

28:08.335 --> 28:10.800
Eugene Pontecorvo?

28:10.900 --> 28:12.500
He's so sweet.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.900
Sweet? He was like an animal.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.465
Are you gonna eat?

28:20.500 --> 28:22.600
I'm not hungry. It's too hot anyway.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.600
I told you I was making dinner tonight.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.400
It's really good chilli.

28:39.100 --> 28:40.865
You should've seen these guys.

28:40.900 --> 28:43.465
They were laughing. It was fucking sick.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.700
- Is this what you grew up with?
- What are you talking about?

28:46.800 --> 28:51.400
- These people, your dad's friends.
- I never saw one bit of violence growing up.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.465
What about your dad's road rage?

28:53.500 --> 28:57.100
Didn't you tell me you had a boyfriend
who was killed? Shot to death?

28:57.200 --> 28:59.865
First of all, he was killed by drug dealers.

28:59.900 --> 29:02.600
African-Americans,
if that makes you feel better.

29:06.600 --> 29:10.500
You know you talk about these guys
like it's an anthropology class.

29:10.535 --> 29:13.800
But they bring certain modes
of conflict resolution

29:13.900 --> 29:15.900
from all the way back in the old country.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.750
From the poverty of the Mezzogiorno,

29:18.785 --> 29:21.500
where all higher authority was corrupt.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.500
For the Lord Jesus Christ
will change our mortal bodies

29:26.535 --> 29:29.300
to be like his in glory. For he is risen.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.765
The first-born from the dead.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.900
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection

29:34.935 --> 29:38.067
unto eternal life
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

29:38.102 --> 29:41.200
we commend to Almighty God
our brother Joseph,

29:41.300 --> 29:43.700
and we commit his body to its resting place.

29:43.800 --> 29:47.500
"Peeps"? It's a fucking nickname.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.800
Family name is Peparelli.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.465
They're gonna redo it.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.950
Fucking Jason... he's dyslexic.

29:57.985 --> 30:01.400
What's that got to do with it?

30:02.800 --> 30:06.100
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

30:06.200 --> 30:08.700
the Lord bless him and keep him.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.165
The Lord make his face to shine upon him.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.900
The Lord lift up his countenance upon him
and give him peace.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.500
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.700
- Amen.
- Amen.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.400
Amen.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.900
John.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.900
I'm sorry about the stone.
It was a mistake. We'll fix it.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.665
You remember Micky Farrell?

30:51.700 --> 30:53.765
Dock worker, used to run Port Newark?

30:53.800 --> 30:56.600
Guess who he saw on
the Upper West Side the other night.

30:56.700 --> 30:59.200
- Your cousin Tony.
- So what does that mean?

30:59.700 --> 31:03.100
- The night Joey bought it?
- You flip your Maserati, hit your head?

31:03.135 --> 31:06.800
- You two-faced fuck!
- Take it easy.

31:06.900 --> 31:10.500
You want to yell at somebody,
the man you should be talking to is there.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.300
That fucking cocksucker.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.600
I should fucking kill him and his fucking wife

31:18.700 --> 31:20.665
and your cousin next.

31:20.700 --> 31:24.700
Come on, let's take a walk.
Calm down, come on.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.400
The fucking gall on that man!

31:42.500 --> 31:44.600
His father must be spinning.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.600
You want my advice?

31:47.700 --> 31:49.850
You go out there, you shake his hand

31:49.885 --> 31:52.000
and you put this fucking shit to bed.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.600
Shake his hand?

31:53.700 --> 31:57.600
- And he kisses the kid's mother?
- That's the way it works, you know that.

31:57.635 --> 31:59.665
Sure, that's why your cousin's here!

31:59.700 --> 32:03.300
You are sincerely mistaken
if you think me or my cousin

32:03.335 --> 32:05.200
had anything to do with this shit.

32:05.300 --> 32:08.465
- He was spotted three blocks away.
- By Micky Farrell!

32:08.500 --> 32:12.100
You're gonna believe
some drunken Irish fuckin' prick over me?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.165
Have a drink.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.400
- I don't want a fuckin' drink.
- Have one anyway.

32:25.100 --> 32:28.000
So how's your daughter doing?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.800
Good.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.200
All right, maybe I'm wrong,

32:46.300 --> 32:49.500
but you haven't been yourself
since the old man died.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.000
Lorraine Calluzzo.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.400
Then you sink this idiot's boat.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.065
That's not the Johnny Sack I know.

33:01.100 --> 33:04.200
I'm waiting for your explanation, Tony.

33:06.400 --> 33:10.200
My cousin could not have been in the city
that night cos he was with me.

33:12.100 --> 33:14.700
We were looking for his daughter, John.

33:14.735 --> 33:17.600
Cos she fuckin' disappeared.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.000
We were Upstate, Monticello.

33:22.100 --> 33:26.400
We'd heard Kelly had been living
with some fucking crackhead up there.

33:26.500 --> 33:30.300
Matter of fact,
we were gonna reach out to you,

33:31.400 --> 33:33.800
see if you could get some of your people on it.

33:34.700 --> 33:38.200
I swear on my mother, Tony,
if I find out you're lying...

33:41.700 --> 33:45.000
I'm sitting here humbling myself
out of friendship to you.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.600
There he is...
"Three out of four dentists surveyed. "

34:34.635 --> 34:37.300
- How you doing?
- Where you going? Come here.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.764
OK, settle this...

34:45.800 --> 34:48.400
If they fought today, both in their prime,

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
Ali or Tyson?

34:50.600 --> 34:53.100
If you were laying a bet.

34:53.135 --> 34:55.364
Jeez...

34:55.400 --> 34:58.000
I really don't know.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.200
He don't know. It's an opinion.

35:03.900 --> 35:07.500
Honestly, after the other day,
I don't wanna say the wrong thing.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.365
You see? This kid's all right.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.900
I should get back. Ramos'll be on my ass.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
Would you forget about Ramos,
for Christ's sakes? I talked to him.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Have a seat.
We got the good doughnuts today.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.400
I'm exhausted. I hardly slept at all last night.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.900
So take a nap. What are you worried about?

35:55.500 --> 35:58.400
You got any idea the money in that casino?

35:58.435 --> 36:00.365
And to give it to Tony B?

36:00.400 --> 36:04.600
Guy's back on the street two minutes,
gets a fucking promotion.

36:04.635 --> 36:06.365
Did you even go to the store?

36:06.400 --> 36:08.400
They're in the freezer like you like.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.965
- Now he's talking about getting a maid.
- Really?

36:15.000 --> 36:18.100
Guy gets out of jail,
suddenly I'm dogshit in Tony's eye.

36:18.135 --> 36:19.700
- Chrissy...
- It's true!

36:19.800 --> 36:22.300
Ever since I cleaned up,
no matter what he says,

36:22.335 --> 36:24.400
Tony don't believe a person can change.

36:24.435 --> 36:26.065
This asshole went to a shrink.

36:26.100 --> 36:30.100
Maybe he thinks you're working too hard.
North Carolina plus other stuff.

36:30.135 --> 36:34.200
I can multitask, Adriana.
I'm not a fucking retard.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.200
It's always some shit with him.

36:36.300 --> 36:38.250
Side deals, secret promises.

36:38.285 --> 36:40.165
He's always got an agenda.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.800
What happened to not sweating
the small stuff?

36:42.835 --> 36:45.400
All I know is I used to be number one cousin.

36:45.435 --> 36:47.400
Now I'm being eased aside.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.500
Your whole attitude in general.

36:55.100 --> 36:57.300
And while we're at it, remember what we said

36:57.400 --> 37:00.400
about interrupting while I'm on the telephone.

37:00.435 --> 37:03.000
OK, Mom.

37:03.100 --> 37:05.300
- Hello?
- It's me.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.200
Hi, what's up?

37:15.800 --> 37:18.600
Dale just told us he figured out
the rest of his life.

37:18.635 --> 37:21.000
- You still thinking CIA?
- Yeah, fight terror.

37:21.100 --> 37:23.400
Nah, I'm gonna go to film school.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.400
Me too.

37:36.700 --> 37:40.100
- I got to motor.
- You don't have to work for like three hours.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.300
He has to sleep a little.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.800
I'll get a ride with Alex.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.000
At this point it doesn't pay to go home.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.400
Maybe I'll just crash at work.

37:50.500 --> 37:53.100
Felicia told me
where there's a key to the trailer.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.300
Felicia told him.

37:57.500 --> 38:01.300
- Be careful driving.
- All right. I'll see you tonight.

38:03.300 --> 38:05.500
- Later.
- Bye.

39:12.900 --> 39:15.500
You sound like a racehorse pissing in there.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.400
How's it going?

39:24.000 --> 39:27.100
- I never asked you what your last name is.
- It's DeTrolio.

39:27.135 --> 39:30.900
Finn DeTrolio, my arch-nemesis.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.500
- You enjoying yourself here?
- It's all right.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.200
I keep telling you you shouldn't work so hard.

39:39.235 --> 39:42.200
Long hours. This fucking heat.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.400
Plus you came in so early today.

39:45.900 --> 39:48.400
I just do what the job is.

39:48.435 --> 39:50.265
Good.

39:50.300 --> 39:53.100
You're strong. That helps.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.000
You know you can call me Vito?

39:58.100 --> 40:01.000
Yeah, I know.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.600
So say it.

40:03.700 --> 40:07.200
Let me hear you say, "What's up, Vito?"

40:09.200 --> 40:11.850
- What's up, Vito?
- Not much, Finn.

40:11.885 --> 40:14.500
Except I got a little surprise for you.

40:14.600 --> 40:18.300
Two tickets to see your Padres
take a beating from the Yanks tonight.

40:19.700 --> 40:23.900
- Shit.
- Third baseline. Plus, it's bat night.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.800
That's really nice, Vito, but I...

40:27.900 --> 40:31.700
- I'm... don't know if I can...
- Don't pull that "aw shucks" shit with me.

40:31.735 --> 40:33.700
You're fuckin' going.

40:40.700 --> 40:43.700
I'll see you under the bat tonight. Seven sharp.

40:43.800 --> 40:46.600
And I don't like to miss the national anthem.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.365
So you're just not gonna show up?

41:05.400 --> 41:07.800
You love baseball. What is wrong with you?

41:07.835 --> 41:10.300
I don't like the guy, all right?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.265
Right. I get it.

41:13.300 --> 41:16.500
Dr DeTrolio can't hang with the common folk.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.665
He came on to me, all right?

41:20.700 --> 41:23.900
- Either that or he wants to kill me.
- What?

41:24.800 --> 41:27.800
I saw him blowing some security guard
in the parking lot.

41:27.900 --> 41:32.200
- When? What are you talking about?
- This morning I showed up early.

41:32.235 --> 41:36.500
I didn't wanna say anything but...
I'm really afraid of this guy.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.900
Vito Spatafore is a married man, Finn.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.350
I seriously doubt he wants to kill you.

41:43.385 --> 41:45.700
Maybe he wants to fuck me and then kill me.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.300
Wait. Is that why you got out the suitcase?

41:52.800 --> 41:55.065
I am not going back to the site.

41:55.100 --> 41:57.900
Do you have any idea
the strings my father pulled

41:58.000 --> 42:00.300
to get you that job? And you just fucking quit?

42:00.400 --> 42:02.300
I'm gonna hear so much bullshit!

42:02.335 --> 42:04.200
So it's all about you, right?

42:04.300 --> 42:09.000
Is that all you can say
whenever it's anything to do with my feelings?

42:10.400 --> 42:13.300
- You're going back to Mission Viejo?
- I didn't say that.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.200
Why don't you just admit it?

42:15.300 --> 42:18.100
This whole thing... the fight, the stuff with Vito,

42:18.135 --> 42:20.217
it's about you not wanting to commit.

42:20.252 --> 42:22.265
I'm here! We fucking live together!

42:22.300 --> 42:25.600
- But you got out a suitcase!
- It's my process, OK?

42:25.635 --> 42:27.400
Look, you never can tell.

42:27.435 --> 42:28.865
Your process?

42:28.900 --> 42:32.300
About anything, the future.
I was thinking out loud.

42:32.400 --> 42:37.600
Well, not out loud, but in the action
of getting out the suitcase I was thinking.

42:37.700 --> 42:39.100
Thinking of leaving!

42:39.135 --> 42:41.565
No. Well, yes.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.900
But, I'm still here. I didn't go.

42:43.935 --> 42:45.500
Fuck you!

42:45.600 --> 42:47.300
Right, great. Fuck me.

42:47.400 --> 42:51.300
There was no abundant intentionality
in me getting out the suitcase.

42:51.400 --> 42:54.500
I can leave too, you know.
My friend Hunter's in Montreal.

42:54.535 --> 42:56.867
Do I know? With the French roommate guy

42:56.902 --> 42:59.165
who was all over your ass when we visited.

42:59.200 --> 43:03.000
You don't think you keep mentioning him
every 24 hours at a minimum?

43:05.600 --> 43:09.000
Because he's thinking
of becoming an oral surgeon.

43:09.035 --> 43:10.965
And you might have had a new friend

43:11.000 --> 43:13.700
if you hadn't been
so obnoxious to him at the club!

43:16.000 --> 43:17.950
Can we just stop fighting?

43:17.985 --> 43:19.892
You got out a suitcase!

43:19.927 --> 43:21.800
I'll put it back, OK?

43:39.200 --> 43:43.000
Now batting for the Padres...

43:51.200 --> 43:52.800
So it's not about us,

43:52.900 --> 43:55.300
but suddenly you're talking about options.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.565
Don't paraphrase what I said.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.900
I said this point in our lives
is a transition period

44:00.935 --> 44:04.100
forced on us by external events.

44:04.135 --> 44:06.167
School is over for me.

44:06.202 --> 44:08.200
And next year for you.

44:08.300 --> 44:13.100
These are difficult choices. You'd rather not
have choices? Thank God for choices.

44:13.135 --> 44:16.665
Stop your bullshit! It's really simple.

44:16.700 --> 44:19.500
- Are we going to stay together or not?
- If you want.

44:19.600 --> 44:22.000
- That's not what I asked!
- I said I did.

44:22.035 --> 44:24.365
You said,
how are we going to keep it together

44:24.400 --> 44:28.000
through four years of dental school for you
and med school for me?

44:28.035 --> 44:30.000
Well, it's a good question.

44:30.100 --> 44:33.200
But why ask it now? Tonight of all times?

44:41.600 --> 44:44.165
- Are you asleep?
- No.

44:44.200 --> 44:48.300
You were! And now you were gonna lie
like you did about the suitcase.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.100
I did not lie about the suitcase.

44:50.135 --> 44:52.267
Then what do you call it?

44:52.302 --> 44:54.400
I don't know, I explained it.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.200
You should quit the law centre.

44:56.300 --> 44:59.100
You're like a prosecutor at four am.
I can't think.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.300
How can you sleep in the middle of this?

45:01.400 --> 45:03.165
In the middle of what?

45:03.200 --> 45:05.465
I said I didn't wanna go back to the job site

45:05.500 --> 45:08.800
and maybe I should go home
until this thing with Vito blows over.

45:08.900 --> 45:10.765
But you didn't ask me to come!

45:10.800 --> 45:13.400
You went to the closet
and got out your suitcase!

45:13.500 --> 45:14.900
Jesus Christ!

45:45.900 --> 45:48.900
Look, just stop crying, OK?

46:30.800 --> 46:34.200
Why don't we just get married?

46:34.235 --> 46:36.165
Married?

46:36.200 --> 46:38.800
Let's get engaged.

46:39.900 --> 46:41.465
Really?

46:41.500 --> 46:43.500
Why are you saying that now?

46:45.800 --> 46:50.100
I can't think, it's too late.
It's just something I feel very strongly.

46:51.800 --> 46:55.200
I was wondering when I'd hear from you.
I never got your statement.

46:55.235 --> 46:58.000
Well, actually that's why I called.

46:58.100 --> 47:01.000
- We hit a bit of a snag.
- What kind of snag?

47:01.100 --> 47:05.300
Well, I put a call in to Phil Canter
a few days ago, the forensic accountant.

47:05.335 --> 47:08.400
- The one with the vending machines.
- I didn't hear from him.

47:08.500 --> 47:11.200
Suddenly he called
and said he wasn't interested.

47:11.235 --> 47:13.000
So I called another accountant.

47:13.100 --> 47:14.600
And?

47:14.700 --> 47:19.300
Frankly, when he heard your husband
was the defendant, he demurred as well.

47:19.400 --> 47:21.800
What does this mean?
You don't want the case?

47:21.835 --> 47:23.900
Well, as my partners reminded me,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I do have a full caseload already.

47:26.035 --> 47:28.000
I probably should have mentioned...

47:44.500 --> 47:46.800
And you were feeling so positive.

47:46.900 --> 47:51.500
I woke up this morning,
the depression just washed over me.

47:51.535 --> 47:54.367
You are dissolving a 20-year marriage.

47:54.402 --> 47:57.200
It's not my fuckin' goddamn marriage, OK?

48:01.400 --> 48:03.800
I had another panic attack.

48:05.100 --> 48:07.000
And I thought I had this shit beat!

48:07.100 --> 48:08.365
What happened?

48:08.400 --> 48:11.200
Playing golf with a friend of mine and he was...

48:13.000 --> 48:16.100
talking about this young guy he knew
who passed away.

48:17.600 --> 48:20.250
I guess I became overcome with emotion

48:20.285 --> 48:22.900
cos they had to help me off the tee.

48:27.500 --> 48:32.000
It's not the first time it's happened recently.

48:32.035 --> 48:33.565
I wish you had told me.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.800
Yeah, well, I wish you'd cured it.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.900
When the attacks first reappeared,

48:41.935 --> 48:44.165
what was going on in your life?

48:44.200 --> 48:46.900
You had just rebuffed my affections.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.100
When you passed out
were you thinking about me, or...

48:53.135 --> 48:56.667
I walked into my house and the cleaning girl

48:56.702 --> 49:00.165
was crying on the phone about her cousin

49:00.200 --> 49:03.800
who went off the road
in a Mexican bus wreck or something.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.465
And I remember just feeling inside

49:07.500 --> 49:11.000
like I wanted to choke her
cos it was always something with her.

49:13.300 --> 49:15.450
Next thing I know, boom!

49:15.485 --> 49:17.600
When did it next happen?

49:20.300 --> 49:22.765
My cousin Tony was up at the house.

49:22.800 --> 49:27.800
He wanted to borrow some tools
and they weren't there.

49:27.835 --> 49:29.565
I was inside talking to Carmela

49:29.600 --> 49:36.200
and started to feel that... you know.
And it passed.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.400
Your cousin was at your house?

49:39.435 --> 49:40.700
Yeah.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.000
Tony Uncle whatever.

49:43.035 --> 49:44.365
Uncle Al.

49:44.400 --> 49:47.500
And your maid was crying about her cousin.

49:49.700 --> 49:51.900
And the other day at the golf course...

49:53.400 --> 49:55.500
my cousin entered into that, too.

49:55.600 --> 49:58.565
- In what way?
- He hurt his foot.

49:58.600 --> 50:02.100
You were so concerned
about your cousin's foot

50:02.135 --> 50:04.500
you collapsed on the golf course?

50:04.535 --> 50:07.000
I worry about him.

50:07.100 --> 50:08.600
He's a grown man, isn't he?

50:10.900 --> 50:12.965
Is he in danger of losing the foot, or...

50:13.000 --> 50:16.600
Fuck his foot! It's not his foot! Forget the foot!

50:19.500 --> 50:22.200
I worry about him. He's...

50:22.300 --> 50:25.400
right out of fucking jail, OK?

50:32.900 --> 50:34.500
All right, look.

50:35.100 --> 50:37.900
The reason he went to prison

50:38.000 --> 50:42.700
is he got pinched
hijacking a truckload of Betamaxes in '86.

50:42.735 --> 50:46.100
They hooked him up on a RICO
and he got 17 years.

50:48.400 --> 50:51.100
I was supposed to be there
the night of the jacking.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.600
- I see.
- You see.

51:00.500 --> 51:02.265
Why didn't you go?

51:02.300 --> 51:04.465
I was jumped by a bunch of moolinyans.

51:04.500 --> 51:09.300
They were trying to take my shoes. I fought
them off, but they cut my fuckin' head open,

51:09.335 --> 51:11.900
the jigaboo cocksucking motherfuckers.

51:11.935 --> 51:14.065
OK, forget that.

51:14.100 --> 51:16.065
Your cousin went to prison.

51:16.100 --> 51:18.700
That's tremendous guilt to carry.

51:18.735 --> 51:20.900
He went to Nam, I was 4F.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.100
And that's the way our friends look at it.

51:24.900 --> 51:27.200
And that's why you favour Tony Uncle Al...

51:27.300 --> 51:30.850
And those 17 years, I did so good.

51:30.885 --> 51:34.400
He lost his wife, his daughter.

51:35.400 --> 51:38.100
No wonder you're having anxiety attacks.

51:38.200 --> 51:40.000
Yeah.

51:40.100 --> 51:42.400
Maybe if you came clean with him?

51:46.900 --> 51:49.100
Yeah, well... yeah.

51:51.700 --> 51:54.600
- You OK?
- Yeah.

51:56.100 --> 52:00.000
Go on... go on...
go on with what you were saying.

52:00.035 --> 52:02.100
- Are you having an attack now?
- No.

52:02.200 --> 52:05.000
I had a huge lunch, that's all. It's gas.

52:05.100 --> 52:07.300
What is it, Anthony?

52:10.500 --> 52:13.400
The night he got pinched
I had a fuckin' panic attack.

52:13.500 --> 52:15.600
From my mother, goddamn it!

52:15.700 --> 52:18.600
- I didn't even know what it was then!
- Just relax.

52:18.635 --> 52:20.565
Focus on your breathing.

52:20.600 --> 52:23.650
- Slowly.
- It's not that, I just...

52:23.685 --> 52:26.700
I just need some Beano or something.

52:26.735 --> 52:29.300
No, just please, focus.

52:30.300 --> 52:33.600
I've got my medical bag in case.

52:37.100 --> 52:40.300
Black guys, my ass.

52:43.800 --> 52:46.900
I had a fight with my mother
and I had a fuckin' panic attack!

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
OK, forget that for now.

52:51.700 --> 52:54.600
Carmela was supposed to come over
with some fuckin' yarn

52:54.700 --> 52:58.000
for some bootees
my mother was making Meadow.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.265
She was late.

53:02.300 --> 53:04.100
What the fuck. Why go into it?

53:04.135 --> 53:06.265
Close your eyes.

53:06.300 --> 53:08.400
Focus on your breathing.

53:14.900 --> 53:18.200
- You want some water?
- She was carrying on.

53:24.200 --> 53:26.765
I said to her... I said, "Carmela loves you.

53:26.800 --> 53:29.900
"You gotta understand it,
she's got a three-month-old. "

53:32.600 --> 53:35.300
But she kept fucking... she kept going

53:35.335 --> 53:37.217
and I started screaming at her.

53:37.252 --> 53:39.065
So I left. I walked out the door.

53:39.100 --> 53:41.500
I went over to the car,
I opened the door, boom!

53:41.600 --> 53:43.165
Cut my fucking head open.

53:43.200 --> 53:47.800
- And your cousin doesn't know this?
- No, I lied! What am I gonna tell him?

53:47.835 --> 53:49.700
What am I gonna tell all of them?

53:51.800 --> 53:54.100
I had a fight with my mother and I fainted?

53:54.135 --> 53:55.700
That's why I missed the job.

54:02.900 --> 54:04.900
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

54:07.800 --> 54:10.100
That's a lot to get off your chest.

54:12.500 --> 54:16.200
I thought I was smart and that's why I bumped
him up and protect him.

54:18.100 --> 54:23.600
Turns out I'm just a fuckin' robot
to my own pussy-ass weakness.

54:23.635 --> 54:26.400
He's also a capable person.

54:29.500 --> 54:30.900
You OK?

54:34.800 --> 54:37.600
Sometimes what happens in here
is like taking a shit.

54:37.700 --> 54:39.700
Yes, OK.

54:39.800 --> 54:45.200
Although I prefer to think of it
more like childbirth.

54:45.235 --> 54:49.500
Trust me. It's like taking a shit.

55:53.200 --> 55:56.700
- Hello?
- Mom? I'm engaged.

55:56.800 --> 55:58.665
- What?
- Finn proposed.

55:58.700 --> 56:02.165
- We're getting married.
- Are you sure?

56:02.200 --> 56:05.300
That's wonderful, honey.
I'm just so surprised!

56:05.400 --> 56:08.400
I... He's gonna finish
dental school, though, right?

56:08.500 --> 56:12.200
We're both finishing school.
We won't marry till we have our degrees.

56:12.300 --> 56:13.965
This is so exciting.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.100
I can't wait for you to meet his parents.

56:16.135 --> 56:17.665
We'll have to have a party.

56:17.700 --> 56:20.700
He's using his graduation present
to buy me a ring.

56:21.700 --> 56:23.900
That is so sweet.

56:24.900 --> 56:26.800
I told him he shouldn't.

56:29.300 --> 56:32.200
- God, I'm gonna cry.
- Yeah.
