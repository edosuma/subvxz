WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:01.829
Previously on "The Americans"...

00:01.854 --> 00:03.520
Burov is back in Moscow.

00:03.556 --> 00:05.389
This is obviously a
good opportunity for us.

00:05.414 --> 00:06.739
We can go with the tape you made of him

00:06.763 --> 00:09.006
admitting their defector
was actually KGB.

00:09.031 --> 00:11.035
You're going to get him killed.

00:11.060 --> 00:13.195
Burov gave us the tip of the century

00:13.220 --> 00:16.120
and then went home to live his life.

00:16.209 --> 00:18.543
I am a consultant for your
Department of Agriculture.

00:18.578 --> 00:21.882
Half our grain comes from
America and its allies.

00:21.907 --> 00:23.514
If they're doing something to it,

00:23.550 --> 00:25.449
people will starve.

00:25.485 --> 00:28.243
Does Morozov know about bugs?

00:28.268 --> 00:29.648
I don't know.

00:29.673 --> 00:31.556
He's an agricultural expert.

00:31.591 --> 00:32.671
Paige, listen...

00:32.697 --> 00:34.236
I'll just be alone for
the rest of my life.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.734
Would that make you feel better?

00:35.759 --> 00:37.562
There's something we can show you.

00:37.597 --> 00:41.415
If you can learn this
thing, really master it,

00:41.763 --> 00:43.704
you can keep seeing him.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.690 --> 00:59.283
- No!
- Aw.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.228
Oh, you will do better, Pashenka.

01:01.588 --> 01:03.845
Don't sweat it, man.

01:04.257 --> 01:06.490
The first time I bowled,
I threw the ball so hard

01:06.526 --> 01:08.225
it went into the lane next to me

01:08.261 --> 01:10.723
and knocked down some other guy's pins.

01:11.595 --> 01:14.123
Start at least four
steps from the foul line.

01:14.148 --> 01:15.914
Bend at the knees...

01:15.939 --> 01:18.102
and aim for the arrows in the lane.

01:26.379 --> 01:29.016
Blind leading blind.

01:29.805 --> 01:32.483
In Russia, we have bowling
alley in Gorky Park.

01:32.518 --> 01:34.552
Pasha was little, hard to push ball,

01:34.587 --> 01:37.653
so I stand behind him
and help give ball push.

01:37.678 --> 01:41.653
One time he go down...
down lane with ball.

01:41.678 --> 01:43.327
You remember?

01:43.363 --> 01:45.496
Another time, ball don't move.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.299
Very popular in Russia.

01:48.334 --> 01:49.334
Very popular.

01:49.369 --> 01:51.076
And then place went to shit.

01:51.101 --> 01:52.403
Again with this.

01:52.438 --> 01:55.406
Wood cracks, ball chip.

01:55.431 --> 01:58.376
Russians can't keep something
simple as a bowling alley, okay.

01:58.411 --> 01:59.610
- Your turn, Dad.
- Oh.

01:59.646 --> 02:01.545
People don't have any
power to make better.

02:01.581 --> 02:04.897
System destroy everybody
who tries to make change.

02:24.586 --> 02:26.780
You see Pasha is unhappy.

02:28.508 --> 02:31.116
Tuan is a friend now. He will be okay.

02:31.141 --> 02:32.616
Where did he go?

02:33.379 --> 02:34.600
Uh...

02:38.506 --> 02:41.068
We have different time growing up.

02:41.093 --> 02:43.960
Evgheniya view and my view
on Soviet Union is different.

02:43.985 --> 02:45.284
When I was 14,

02:45.309 --> 02:47.904
they drag my father
out of our apartment...

02:48.215 --> 02:49.537
in night,

02:49.562 --> 02:52.264
no talking, no explaining.

02:52.289 --> 02:55.500
Six months later, letter
come, tell us he's in camp.

02:55.535 --> 02:58.502
So my mother and I, we
ride train to see him.

02:58.538 --> 03:00.891
Take us nine days to get there.

03:00.916 --> 03:03.241
And it's horrible. Just horrible.

03:03.283 --> 03:06.517
Prisoners outside for
everybody to see, with lice,

03:06.542 --> 03:09.602
starving to death, not human.

03:09.907 --> 03:11.515
We wait in the room for two days.

03:11.551 --> 03:13.384
And the guard comes and tell us

03:13.419 --> 03:16.477
my father is not allowed any visitors.

03:16.502 --> 03:18.456
He die 15 years later.

03:18.491 --> 03:20.180
They never let us see him.

03:20.205 --> 03:24.461
That... is the Soviet Union I know.

03:46.038 --> 03:50.366
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

03:52.632 --> 03:54.155
Sounds like Evgheniya and Pasha

03:54.180 --> 03:56.534
didn't know Alexei
was planning to defect.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.139
What do you mean?

03:58.164 --> 03:59.997
She was angry at him
about not telling them

04:00.044 --> 04:01.840
they were coming here.

04:02.113 --> 04:05.479
He must've just put
them in a car one day,

04:05.504 --> 04:08.050
and it was the CIA taking
them out of the country.

04:08.086 --> 04:10.052
How could somebody do
something like that?

04:10.088 --> 04:13.520
That man really hates his country.

04:15.126 --> 04:18.461
One day the U.S. will destroy the USSR,

04:18.778 --> 04:21.168
just like they did Vietnam.

04:21.754 --> 04:24.066
I'd like to see what Alexei has to say

04:24.102 --> 04:26.235
when everyone and everything
he ever knew in Russia

04:26.270 --> 04:28.043
is wiped out.

04:29.407 --> 04:33.175
Well, hopefully, we'll
prevent that from happening.

04:33.211 --> 04:35.244
Yes. Of course.

04:35.279 --> 04:37.317
I just meant...

04:38.116 --> 04:39.895
he's a traitor.

04:45.256 --> 04:47.189
Okay if I drop you at the house?

04:47.225 --> 04:48.524
Yes.

05:02.206 --> 05:04.340
I was just thinking how
we would have done it

05:04.375 --> 05:06.664
if we had to go back.

05:07.211 --> 05:09.562
Tell them first or when we got there?

05:11.836 --> 05:13.115
It's different.

05:13.151 --> 05:15.217
Alexei didn't have to run.

05:15.445 --> 05:17.773
He wanted to come
here and be a big shot.

05:17.798 --> 05:20.055
He didn't give a shit
what his family thought.

05:20.091 --> 05:22.136
He gets them here, buys
them big meals at Bennigan's,

05:22.160 --> 05:24.180
and he's starting a famine back home.

05:26.322 --> 05:27.521
Tuan's right.

05:27.546 --> 05:29.279
He should be shot.

05:35.836 --> 05:39.141
That was smart, him
throwing the gutter balls

05:39.177 --> 05:40.774
to make Pasha feel better.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.532
He's got great instincts.

05:51.906 --> 05:54.281
Did Paige say anything about Matthew?

05:55.092 --> 05:56.458
Mnh-mnh.

05:56.851 --> 05:58.867
She can't handle this.

05:59.363 --> 06:01.000
Any of it.

06:16.803 --> 06:19.470
What if we tell her
about this operation?

06:21.728 --> 06:24.153
It's a good thing. She'll get it.

06:24.188 --> 06:25.719
I don't know...

06:25.744 --> 06:27.541
Compared to this,

06:27.566 --> 06:30.127
Matthew Beeman won't seem so important.

06:38.169 --> 06:40.236
Just as I suspected. A closet general.

06:40.271 --> 06:42.391
Step right this way, sir.

06:43.140 --> 06:45.204
Crap. Check outside.

06:48.312 --> 06:49.780
Hi, honey.

06:49.805 --> 06:51.430
- Hi.
- All clear.

06:51.985 --> 06:53.696
Where are you taking him?

06:54.852 --> 06:57.286
- Henry here?
- Nope.

07:03.060 --> 07:04.566
What?

07:09.300 --> 07:10.683
Oh.

07:12.303 --> 07:14.303
All we need is for
somebody to salute him.

07:14.338 --> 07:16.878
You're gonna be
returning it as a reflex.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.660
Okay.

07:23.603 --> 07:26.015
We think the U.S. government

07:26.050 --> 07:29.947
is planning to attack the
Soviet Union's grain supply.

07:32.564 --> 07:33.612
What?

07:33.637 --> 07:35.735
We found a greenhouse they've got...

07:35.760 --> 07:37.126
where they're testing pests

07:37.161 --> 07:40.392
that can destroy entire wheat crops.

07:42.478 --> 07:45.134
I know it's a shocking thing to hear.

07:45.169 --> 07:48.470
But... that's something that they do.

07:48.861 --> 07:50.784
They go after us any way they can,

07:50.809 --> 07:54.090
including the food people eat.

07:55.246 --> 07:56.784
We're not a rich country.

07:56.809 --> 08:01.276
So nuclear weapons aren't bad enough?

08:01.301 --> 08:03.018
If we stop this,

08:03.054 --> 08:05.660
then a lot of people
won't have to suffer.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.716
Can you stop them?

08:17.677 --> 08:20.084
- Uh, we're trying.
- How?

08:20.732 --> 08:22.444
Last year, the, uh,

08:22.469 --> 08:25.879
the CIA snuck an agricultural expert

08:25.904 --> 08:27.623
out of the Soviet Union.

08:27.670 --> 08:29.770
And he's advising them on
all of their grain stuff.

08:29.795 --> 08:31.380
And we found him.

08:31.670 --> 08:35.317
And now we're developing
a relationship with him.

08:35.352 --> 08:37.256
In secret.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.020
He's... he's a source?

08:42.561 --> 08:45.462
Yeah. Yeah. Something like that.

08:53.390 --> 08:56.271
How can you trust what he tells you?

08:56.307 --> 09:00.275
Well, we don't necessarily
trust what anyone tells us.

09:00.562 --> 09:02.834
But we can get a sense from people,

09:02.859 --> 09:06.415
and sometimes we can
check their information.

09:06.793 --> 09:08.381
But...

09:09.259 --> 09:11.967
aren't you afraid that people
will call the police on you

09:11.992 --> 09:14.023
or tell somebody or something?

09:14.065 --> 09:16.032
We take precautions.

09:16.060 --> 09:19.265
- Like what?
- We don't tell them our real names.

09:22.844 --> 09:26.547
So they just think you're, like...

09:26.823 --> 09:28.711
other people?

09:32.309 --> 09:36.078
So who does the Russian
guy think you are?

09:37.174 --> 09:38.475
A pilot...

09:38.500 --> 09:40.969
and his wife, who's a stewardess.

09:46.090 --> 09:50.192
Are you... pretending to be his friend?

09:50.227 --> 09:52.720
Sometimes we do that, yes.

09:52.745 --> 09:55.290
To get the information that we need.

10:01.853 --> 10:05.119
Is it hard, pretending
to be other people?

10:05.473 --> 10:06.814
Yeah.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.302
Sometimes it's really hard.

15:28.474 --> 15:30.770
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, last week.

15:30.795 --> 15:34.089
Saturday, Monday,
Thursday, week before last.

15:34.114 --> 15:36.253
So far this week, it's been
Tuesday and Wednesday...

15:36.278 --> 15:39.325
so no regular shifts that I see.

15:40.434 --> 15:43.602
It would be easier if
I had a dog to walk.

15:43.841 --> 15:46.642
How's, um... how's Pasha?

15:46.677 --> 15:50.433
He wants me to tell him how
to be cool... how to dress.

15:50.458 --> 15:53.549
Like changing his shirt is
gonna make anybody like him.

15:53.584 --> 15:56.023
He should try learning a
few more words in English

15:56.048 --> 15:58.615
and quit talking about
how much he hates his dad.

15:59.690 --> 16:01.665
He's lucky he has a dad.

16:03.728 --> 16:05.561
He's always picking at his food,

16:05.596 --> 16:07.563
while his mother is
telling him what to eat,

16:07.598 --> 16:09.292
like a baby.

16:10.042 --> 16:12.992
Back home, I ate garbage
off the street most days.

16:13.017 --> 16:15.089
Other days, I never ate at all.

16:17.808 --> 16:20.265
My father died when I was six.

16:20.290 --> 16:21.530
In the war?

16:22.155 --> 16:23.296
No, after.

16:23.321 --> 16:25.414
But before...

16:25.449 --> 16:27.583
before he died, there
wasn't enough food.

16:27.608 --> 16:29.882
Not as bad as you, but...

16:29.907 --> 16:31.741
we went hungry a lot.

16:49.707 --> 16:51.335
Here you go.

16:55.646 --> 16:57.349
Hello, Anatoli.

16:58.639 --> 17:01.466
We're from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

17:01.491 --> 17:04.019
In case you can't tell from our suits.

17:04.044 --> 17:05.497
We're sorry to disturb your lunch.

17:05.521 --> 17:08.262
We only want to talk to you
for two or three minutes.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.119
We know you work for Aeroflot.

17:10.145 --> 17:12.594
This is an organization
that's very interesting to us.

17:12.630 --> 17:14.508
We were hoping you'd be
willing to get together with us

17:14.531 --> 17:17.288
at some other time, in some other place,

17:17.313 --> 17:19.468
and maybe, y...

17:31.878 --> 17:33.811
What? He didn't touch it.

17:36.854 --> 17:40.743
Our entomologists tell
us the bug we sent them

17:40.768 --> 17:44.693
was a cryptic species,
previously unidentified,

17:44.728 --> 17:47.157
related to a kind of midge

17:47.182 --> 17:49.731
that's never been seen out of Australia.

17:49.767 --> 17:52.768
Not only can this midge decimate grain,

17:52.803 --> 17:56.471
it can carry spores that
can do even further damage.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.069
Don't we inspect the grain they send us?

18:02.094 --> 18:03.445
Oh, the bug's larvae

18:03.480 --> 18:05.681
are apparently too small for detection.

18:05.716 --> 18:09.718
And this pest, released
in our grain supply,

18:09.753 --> 18:11.844
could destroy us.

18:12.942 --> 18:15.724
The rezidentura in Canberra

18:15.769 --> 18:18.871
came across some customs documents.

18:18.896 --> 18:21.563
A shipment of midges
was sent six weeks ago

18:21.599 --> 18:24.041
to a business address in Oklahoma.

18:26.236 --> 18:28.604
Aren't we going to stop
the grain shipments?

18:28.639 --> 18:31.088
We don't know what
we're talking about yet.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.843
Maybe they're infecting
the grain shipments.

18:34.879 --> 18:37.546
And maybe the bugs
are intended to attack

18:37.581 --> 18:39.252
our own harvests.

18:39.277 --> 18:42.690
They could send them over
in a million different ways.

18:43.359 --> 18:45.852
We'll get to Oklahoma as soon as we can.

18:55.451 --> 18:57.541
We told Paige a little bit

18:57.566 --> 18:59.908
about what we're doing here.

19:02.877 --> 19:04.414
How did that go?

19:04.439 --> 19:07.676
Looks like she's, uh,
rethinking a lot of things.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.439
Including us.

19:11.605 --> 19:14.142
She doesn't like people being starved.

19:16.215 --> 19:18.353
She feels closer to you.

19:19.197 --> 19:22.491
In that case, I think
it was a good idea.

19:28.284 --> 19:31.090
So my dad started dating
this woman he met at the gym.

19:31.351 --> 19:32.712
They've only been out
like a couple times,

19:32.736 --> 19:35.531
but, uh, he keeps going
on and on about her.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.673
It bothers you?

19:37.708 --> 19:40.107
I don't know. It's just weird, you know?

19:40.132 --> 19:42.544
Yeah. When my parents
separated that time,

19:42.579 --> 19:46.851
I was always scared they would
start dating other people.

19:48.124 --> 19:49.618
Are you okay?

19:49.653 --> 19:51.359
You seem sad.

19:52.296 --> 19:54.790
The world just seems so messy right now.

19:54.825 --> 19:58.562
It's hard to figure
out what to do about it.

19:58.617 --> 20:01.052
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it.

20:01.077 --> 20:02.781
You really think so?

20:03.271 --> 20:04.663
Yeah.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.395
Is everything okay at home?

20:09.420 --> 20:12.403
- Are your parents fighting?
- No. Nothing like that.

20:13.811 --> 20:15.711
What is it?

20:15.746 --> 20:17.546
Okay. You can tell me.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.593
I'm... I'm fine. I just, uh...

20:28.770 --> 20:32.375
I'm totally behind on this
Napoleon paper I have for history.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.453
And, uh, it's making me tense.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.328
Is that it?

20:38.353 --> 20:39.846
Well, yeah. I got a B on my last paper,

20:39.870 --> 20:42.328
so I got to pull my grade up.

20:42.552 --> 20:45.000
Okay. I can help you with that.

20:46.281 --> 20:48.664
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:51.434 --> 20:52.859
Mom?

21:08.331 --> 21:09.951
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:11.602 --> 21:13.389
What are you doing?

21:13.704 --> 21:15.006
Work.

21:15.490 --> 21:18.747
It's, um... quiet and private down here.

21:18.772 --> 21:21.912
It's a good place to get things done.

21:22.459 --> 21:24.679
Are you working on that grain thing?

21:24.715 --> 21:26.106
Yeah.

21:26.131 --> 21:27.436
How's it going?

21:27.461 --> 21:31.301
Are you... closer to stopping it?

21:31.326 --> 21:34.153
Uh, we're gathering information.

21:34.178 --> 21:37.759
We're actually going
to Oklahoma tomorrow.

21:37.795 --> 21:39.482
Follow a few leads.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.864
It could be nothing, but
it always takes so much time

21:42.900 --> 21:45.943
and work to figure anything out.

21:47.209 --> 21:50.662
I had an awful
conversation with Matthew.

21:52.022 --> 21:53.623
What happened?

21:54.279 --> 21:55.744
I don't know. He was just asking

21:55.779 --> 21:57.944
about you guys and...

21:57.969 --> 21:59.959
how things are at home...

22:02.189 --> 22:03.652
And what did you say?

22:03.687 --> 22:05.487
I don't know. Uh...

22:09.769 --> 22:11.728
Nothing. I...

22:14.755 --> 22:17.632
Did you use the technique we showed you?

22:17.668 --> 22:19.634
I looked him right in the face

22:19.670 --> 22:23.943
and I lied... about why I was so tense.

22:25.709 --> 22:28.043
It was... easy.

22:28.068 --> 22:29.700
He had no idea.

22:31.682 --> 22:34.935
It felt... gross.

22:38.689 --> 22:42.891
Do you think it would have
been fair to tell him the truth?

22:43.027 --> 22:45.452
To put that burden on him?

22:48.832 --> 22:50.585
So that's how it's gonna be?

22:50.610 --> 22:52.634
Just for the rest of my life,

22:52.669 --> 22:54.669
I have to be fake with my boyfriends?

22:54.705 --> 22:56.053
Paige, wait.

22:56.131 --> 22:57.585
It's not being fake.

22:58.066 --> 22:59.686
It's...

23:00.544 --> 23:02.870
being in a relationship is complicated.

23:03.206 --> 23:05.214
You don't share everything.

23:05.239 --> 23:07.406
You hold back what you need to.

23:07.684 --> 23:09.551
Everybody does.

27:38.956 --> 27:41.705
Marilyn said they'll meet us at 10:00.

27:42.056 --> 27:44.319

Mr. Pirogov.

30:37.471 --> 30:40.364
We're with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

30:40.568 --> 30:44.012
We wanted to talk with you
about your work with Amtorg.

30:44.335 --> 30:45.716
If you'd be willing to talk with us

30:45.740 --> 30:48.908
and help us figure out
certain things we need to know,

30:49.064 --> 30:51.131
we can offer you help.

31:29.380 --> 31:31.119
You missed the meeting.

31:31.144 --> 31:33.096
Stay away from me.

31:33.468 --> 31:35.158
I'm sorry.

32:44.209 --> 32:46.335
An order came in from the Centre.

32:47.342 --> 32:49.239
No assassinations without the approval

32:49.264 --> 32:50.616
of all departments at the Centre

32:50.641 --> 32:52.600
and the local rezidents.

32:54.074 --> 32:56.357
She got a message to them.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.740
It can't be a coincidence.

33:00.102 --> 33:02.553
She's working for us.

36:33.853 --> 36:35.765
These could be them.

36:44.081 --> 36:45.425
Maybe.

38:12.444 --> 38:14.344
Oh, Je...

38:20.318 --> 38:22.949
Th-there's no money in here, but...

38:24.066 --> 38:25.543
here.

38:27.225 --> 38:29.890
Y-you can take my car, too.

38:33.026 --> 38:35.026
What is this place?

38:35.051 --> 38:36.817
It's... a lab.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.202
And what kind of work do you do here?

38:39.227 --> 38:40.303
I-I don't know.

38:40.338 --> 38:42.500
I'm... I'm just a lab technician.

38:45.243 --> 38:48.244
Randy Chilton, Deputy Director,

38:48.279 --> 38:51.016
Smith-Poole Research Laboratory.

38:51.641 --> 38:53.416
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm
not allowed to talk

38:53.451 --> 38:54.867
about the work that we do here.

38:54.892 --> 38:56.539
Who do you work for?

39:00.992 --> 39:04.310
You really should tell us, Randy.

39:04.335 --> 39:06.599
I'm sorry, but I can't.

39:09.869 --> 39:14.669
What kind of bugs are these, huh?

39:16.141 --> 39:17.560
What do they do?

39:27.322 --> 39:28.851
Randy?

39:32.898 --> 39:34.424
We don't... it doesn't have a name.

39:34.467 --> 39:37.368
W-we derived it from
Sitodiplosis mosellana.

39:37.395 --> 39:40.741
- What does it do?
- It's a pest. It eats crops.

39:40.766 --> 39:43.289
- What kind of crops?
- Wheat.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.601
It's... it's a wheat-eater.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.977
- Who do you work for?
- The lab has a contract...

39:50.002 --> 39:52.400
- with a-a company called AgriCorp.
- And who's your contact there?

39:52.424 --> 39:54.444
We just get phone calls
from different people.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.012
Jim, Mary, I-I don't...

39:56.047 --> 39:58.530
- I don't know their last names.
- What department are they in?

39:58.555 --> 40:00.328
I don't know. They
don't tell us anything.

40:00.353 --> 40:03.828
They just contracted us to breed
Sitodiplosis mosellana for them.

40:03.853 --> 40:06.033
How many pests have
been delivered so far?

40:06.783 --> 40:09.016
We don't send the bugs.
We... we send eggs.

40:09.041 --> 40:10.226
How many eggs?

40:10.261 --> 40:12.158
30,000 to 40,000.

40:14.103 --> 40:17.333
It's-It's not that many.
It's... it's complicated.

40:17.368 --> 40:20.330
- Do you know anything about bugs?
- Where are you sending them?

40:20.846 --> 40:22.305
I-I ca... I can tell you.

40:22.340 --> 40:23.869
It's... it's in... in my Rolodex.

40:23.894 --> 40:26.291
Can I go to my desk, please?

40:35.553 --> 40:37.169
Here.

40:42.393 --> 40:44.834
- When does the next shipment go out?
- Two weeks.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.420
What are they using them for?

40:48.466 --> 40:49.741
W-we don't ask those questions.

40:49.766 --> 40:52.499
We just breed the bugs they tell us.

41:01.723 --> 41:03.379
You should have asked.

41:03.414 --> 41:05.380
Please, I...

41:05.857 --> 41:07.982
Stop, please!

42:31.502 --> 42:33.143
You okay?

42:34.138 --> 42:35.534
Yes.

43:02.583 --> 43:05.078
Should we tell Paige about this?

43:06.305 --> 43:12.560
