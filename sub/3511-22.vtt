00:33.900 --> 00:36.769
You got in late last night.
Catch a case?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.040
Yeah.

00:40.470 --> 00:42.690
Actually, it was this one.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.439
Someone blew up an
apartment downtown.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.400
Seriously?
And you didn't call me?

00:50.010 --> 00:51.720
Castle, you said you
had a chapter due.

00:51.721 --> 00:54.759
Yes, which is writer speak for
"all procrastination's welcome."

00:54.760 --> 00:57.670
So what was it, a
terrorist plot, a meth lab?

00:58.690 --> 01:01.339
The canvass turned up a
description of a guy

01:01.340 --> 01:03.849
fleeing the scene in
a silver hatchback.

01:03.850 --> 01:06.329
And we called in for
traffic cam footage.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.620
Which is probably already
in, so I gotta get going.

01:08.621 --> 01:11.079
Or... you could have
Esposito check that out.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.160
He's very good at it.
I feel like I haven't seen you in days.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.170
You know, I really do
have to get going, but--

01:18.171 --> 01:21.619
But you're powerless to resist me.
You always have been.

01:21.620 --> 01:22.849
Really?

01:22.850 --> 01:25.839
Do you remember when we first met?
I kinda thought you were an ass.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.150
Oh, I know you pretended
you thought that. But come on.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.660
We're together now.
You can admit it.

01:30.661 --> 01:33.009
You fell for me the first
moment you saw me.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.493
- No, I didn't.
- Please. You did.

01:36.633 --> 01:38.890
- You believe that, don't you?
- It's true.

01:40.020 --> 01:41.120
Oh, hold on.

01:41.420 --> 01:44.010
Beckett.

01:44.530 --> 01:46.450
Okay. I'll be right there.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.840
Traffic cam footage turned
up a match to the plates.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.180
- We got him.
- Nice.

01:54.770 --> 01:56.850
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.369
- Did you see the hearts?
- Let's go, Castle.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.200
Took me, like... six minutes.

02:04.670 --> 02:07.519
The car's license plate was
registered to Archibald Fosse.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.479
He lives alone in a
fourth-floor apartment.

02:09.481 --> 02:11.389
This isn't his first
rodeo, either.

02:11.390 --> 02:12.750
He got in trouble
playing the ponies

02:12.751 --> 02:15.949
so he took out his bookie with
a car bomb six years ago.

02:15.950 --> 02:17.330
Six years and he's already out?

02:17.331 --> 02:19.328
Well, he was supposed
to do 20 years to life.

02:19.329 --> 02:21.678
But his case got overturned
on appeal three months ago.

02:21.679 --> 02:23.630
Any idea about the motivation
for last night's bombing?

02:23.631 --> 02:25.709
No, we just ID'ed him
20 minutes ago.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.250
There's a lot we have
to learn about him yet.

02:27.251 --> 02:29.609
Yo, Beckett.
This is Diego Jiminez.

02:29.610 --> 02:32.589
Uniforms intercepted him on his
way up to pay Mr. Fosse a visit.

02:32.590 --> 02:33.400
How do you know him?

02:33.401 --> 02:35.689
I don't, really.
I've never even met him.

02:35.690 --> 02:37.800
We connected on-line.
I'm a collector.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.949
He said he had some baseball cards
from the '30s he wanted to sell.

02:40.950 --> 02:41.588
That's all.

02:41.589 --> 02:42.420
Well, we know this much.

02:42.421 --> 02:45.480
If Diego had an appointment,
Fosse's probably in there.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.629
Police! Move! Move! Go! Go! Go!

02:48.630 --> 02:50.090
NYPD!

03:11.510 --> 03:13.630
Ryan, Espo, he's
coming your way.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.800
Freeze! NYPD!

03:21.300 --> 03:23.110
Let me see your hands.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.520
Drop it! Drop it now!

03:27.840 --> 03:30.480
What is that?
Why is it flashing?

03:31.420 --> 03:34.640
Answer me! Answer me!

03:45.080 --> 03:46.899
Baseball cards,
just like he said.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.568
Beckett, Castle, get
outta there now.

03:48.569 --> 03:50.218
The suspect had some kind
of device in his pocket.

03:50.219 --> 03:51.430
I think he armed something.

03:51.431 --> 03:55.170
Copy that. Everyone out now.
Let's go. You guys, out.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.619
What was that?

04:04.620 --> 04:07.430
Castle...

04:07.610 --> 04:09.600
I think I'm standing on a bomb.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.390
how long do you think
we'll have to stand here?

04:31.920 --> 04:34.259
Once Bomb Disposal
finishes their sweep,

04:34.260 --> 04:36.118
we'll know if there are any
other bombs you could step on,

04:36.119 --> 04:37.680
or if I'm standing
on the only one.

04:37.681 --> 04:40.330
We don't know that you're standing on a bomb.
It could be nothing.

04:40.650 --> 04:44.320
It didn't feel like nothing.
Something gave way under my feet.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.880
It felt like a trigger plate.

04:45.881 --> 04:47.869
Could be a wonky floorboard.

04:47.870 --> 04:48.980
With a metallic click?

04:48.981 --> 04:51.739
Loose nail.
That's how floorboards get wonky.

04:51.740 --> 04:52.690
Well, I hope you're right.

04:52.691 --> 04:55.449
I'm right.
I mean, think about it.

04:55.450 --> 04:59.379
Who puts a live bomb in
their own apartment?

04:59.380 --> 05:01.000
It makes no sense.

05:02.690 --> 05:04.330
You hungry?

05:05.020 --> 05:05.929
Why?

05:05.930 --> 05:08.288
Because any minute, someone's
gonna come through that door

05:08.289 --> 05:09.240
and give us the all clear.

05:09.241 --> 05:12.329
And there is an amazing diner
not three blocks from here.

05:12.330 --> 05:13.950
Yeah? Well, I did miss my
breakfast this morning.

05:13.951 --> 05:14.919
Yeah.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.689
They make these incredible,
foamy lattes--

05:17.690 --> 05:19.519
cups as big as your head--

05:19.520 --> 05:22.639
and a goat cheese
omelet to die for.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.109
Which would be a
poor choice of words

05:25.110 --> 05:27.249
if you were standing on
a bomb, but guess what.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.150
You're not.

05:29.610 --> 05:32.040
You know, if I have
to be, uh, stuck...

05:32.200 --> 05:35.849
not standing on a bomb, then
I'm glad I'm stuck with you.

05:35.850 --> 05:36.699
I know.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.448
Captain Mahoney,
Bomb Disposal Unit.

05:38.449 --> 05:39.908
Which one of you is
Detective Beckett?

05:39.909 --> 05:41.750
I'm Detective Beckett.
This is Castle.

05:41.751 --> 05:43.129
Castle, you can relax.

05:43.130 --> 05:45.220
We've X-rayed the entire
apartment from the floor below.

05:45.221 --> 05:47.869
There are no other explosives.

05:47.870 --> 05:49.719
No other explosives? So...

05:49.720 --> 05:51.939
Detective, I'm afraid
you've stepped on

05:51.940 --> 05:54.239
a sensor plate wired
to a detonator.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.979
Depressing that plate was sort of
like cocking the hammer of a gun.

05:57.980 --> 06:01.459
You take your weight off there,
it's like pulling the trigger.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.980
So it's very important
that you don't move

06:04.520 --> 06:06.920
until we figure out
how to disarm it.

06:12.090 --> 06:13.789
BDU just confirmed it.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.459
Beckett's standing on a bomb.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.239
Trace detection estimates
10 kilograms of RDX.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.950
Enough to take out
the whole building.

06:19.951 --> 06:21.390
So what's the plan?

06:21.680 --> 06:23.279
Sir, tell me there's a plan.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.338
They're working on it.
What do we have on that bomber?

06:25.339 --> 06:26.778
Looks like his
motive was revenge.

06:26.779 --> 06:28.668
Kelly Runther, the woman
he blew up last night,

06:28.669 --> 06:30.980
testified against him at his
arson trial six years ago.

06:30.981 --> 06:33.009
Then why would he booby-trap
his own apartment?

06:33.010 --> 06:35.069
The defense at his trial
centered on allegations

06:35.070 --> 06:36.700
of evidence tampering
by police, so...

06:36.701 --> 06:38.299
He's got a vendetta
against cops.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.039
Yes, Sir.
He wanted this to happen.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.929
Well, we're not gonna let it.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.210
You get him in the box.

06:43.211 --> 06:45.610
I want to know how to
deactivate that bomb.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.719
What makes you think
it can be deactivated?

06:49.720 --> 06:52.249
You better pray that it can,
because the person standing on it,

06:52.250 --> 06:53.750
she's a friend of mine.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.519
Not for long.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.748
That's where you're wrong.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.230
See, you're gonna help us.
You know how the bomb is made.

06:59.231 --> 07:01.859
The detonator, the fuse, all
the other little parts--

07:01.860 --> 07:04.529
if they can stop any one of those
parts from working, the bomb fails.

07:04.530 --> 07:06.999
It's not gonna fail.
I'm not done yet.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.218
None of this is over.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.188
Well, then you're going
back to jail a cop killer,

07:10.189 --> 07:11.180
and there's not a prison
around that's gonna--

07:11.181 --> 07:14.140
You want to save your friend?
I want a lawyer.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.730
Now.

07:19.880 --> 07:25.750
We're estimating the trigger
plate is about 3 feet by 3 feet.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.789
So no one crosses this line.

07:28.790 --> 07:31.050
And the disarming process, how
long does that usually take?

07:31.051 --> 07:32.689
Well, that depends on the bomb.

07:32.690 --> 07:35.419
We still don't know what kind
of device we're dealing with.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.419
So what are we supposed
to do in the meantime,

07:37.420 --> 07:39.709
just--you can't have
her just stand there.

07:39.710 --> 07:40.930
I'm okay, Castle.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.930
No, you're not okay.
You're standing...

07:45.150 --> 07:47.570
Look, you said, uh, stepping on the
plate was like cocking the hammer.

07:47.571 --> 07:49.869
Stepping off the plate
was pulling the trigger.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.509
What if we replaced Beckett
with something of equal weight?

07:53.510 --> 07:56.869
You know, just the old Indiana Jones
bag of sand/golden idol trick.

07:56.870 --> 07:58.600
Remember how that turned out?

07:59.010 --> 08:00.690
Look, the plate she's
standing on can sense

08:00.691 --> 08:03.049
even minor fluctuations
in pressure.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.719
You try to transfer the weight,
you'll set off the bomb.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.958
Put any kind of protective gear
on her, you'll set off the bomb.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.580
She shifts too quickly from
one foot to the other--

08:09.581 --> 08:12.819
Set off the bomb. I-I get it.
Thank you. I'm sorry I asked.

08:12.820 --> 08:15.279
So what are we supposed
to do, just stand here?

08:15.280 --> 08:16.659
Not you, Mr. Castle.

08:16.660 --> 08:19.009
All nonessential
personnel must evacuate.

08:19.010 --> 08:21.239
Oh, no.
I am essential personnel.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.690
Castle, it's okay.

08:24.370 --> 08:25.800
We'll take good care of her.

08:25.801 --> 08:28.689
I got guys downstairs right
now figuring this out.

08:28.690 --> 08:31.780
Meantime, Detective, sit tight.
I'll check back with you soon.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.950
I appreciate it. I'm staying.

08:36.429 --> 08:38.768
Castle, please. There is no
reason to put yourself in danger.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.590
There's nothing that
you can do here.

08:40.591 --> 08:44.470
Nothing? Excuse me.
Who's gonna be your bomb buddy?

08:44.890 --> 08:45.728
My bomb buddy?

08:45.729 --> 08:46.800
You heard what he said.

08:46.801 --> 08:49.419
You're gonna be standing
here, maybe for hours.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.689
If I don't stay, who's gonna
keep your spirits up?

08:51.690 --> 08:54.119
Who's gonna take your mind
off of getting tired?

08:54.120 --> 08:56.379
Castle, I'm gonna be fine.
I feel fine.

08:56.380 --> 08:59.989
That would be great if you were a
reliable judge of your own feelings,

08:59.990 --> 09:01.730
which clearly, you're not.

09:01.860 --> 09:02.700
What does that mean?

09:02.701 --> 09:04.959
I'm sorry.
Exhibit "A"-- according to you,

09:04.960 --> 09:07.039
you felt nothing for
me when we first met,

09:07.040 --> 09:10.559
- which we both know.. 
- Are you act--oh, I get it.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.398
- I know what you're doing.
- What?

09:12.399 --> 09:13.448
You know what, Castle?
Forget it.

09:13.449 --> 09:15.910
I'm not going down that path.
You can just go now.

09:15.911 --> 09:18.499
Fine, I'll leave
if you admit to me

09:18.500 --> 09:21.250
you had feelings for
me when we first met.

09:22.310 --> 09:25.990
Fine. I did have feelings
for you when we first met.

09:26.110 --> 09:27.499
I couldn't stand you.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.209
Do you even remember what you
were like in the beginning?

09:30.210 --> 09:31.780
Well, apparently, I
was irresistible.

09:31.781 --> 09:34.520
Irresistible? Are you joking?

09:36.490 --> 09:41.159
Richard Castle, you are under
arrest for obstruction of justice.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.570
You forgot making you look bad.

09:42.571 --> 09:44.289
- Cuff him.
- Come on.

09:44.290 --> 09:46.789
Bondage.
My safe word is "apples."

09:46.790 --> 09:48.620
Do I look like
a killer to you?

09:48.740 --> 09:50.289
Yes, you kill my patience.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.259
Guess who's got a date
with a prostitute?

09:53.260 --> 09:56.319
So many lonely women approached me
thinking I was their Tom Hanks.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.619
- I got la--
- Castle.

09:57.620 --> 09:58.590
Don't make me shoot you.

09:58.591 --> 10:00.669
I really am ruggedly
handsome, aren't I?

10:00.670 --> 10:02.039
I am gonna kill you.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.265
Do I have to wait for him to
sign or can I shoot him now?

10:04.266 --> 10:06.509
- How shallow are you?
- Very.

10:06.510 --> 10:08.900
Call me a muse again, and I
will break both your legs.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.229
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:10.230 --> 10:10.948
In your dreams.

10:10.949 --> 10:12.330
Actually, in my dreams,
you're never jealous.

10:12.331 --> 10:14.420
In my dreams, you
just join in--ooh.

10:16.110 --> 10:19.489
Okay. If you couldn't stand me
when we first met, tell me this.

10:19.490 --> 10:22.270
Why couldn't you keep
your hands off me?

10:22.660 --> 10:25.029
What are you even talking about?

10:25.030 --> 10:28.200
Oh, you know what
I'm talking about.

10:29.540 --> 10:34.480
Okay. Of course. Sure.
I'll be right there.

10:39.190 --> 10:40.610
Apples. Apples. Apples.

10:43.390 --> 10:44.960
Hold my hand.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.679
That? Castle, that
was called survival.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.749
We were just
huddling for warmth.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.139
- Cuddling?
- Huddling.

10:56.140 --> 10:59.740
Or one could see it as a small
part of a larger pattern--

11:00.060 --> 11:01.588
unwanted touching
in the workplace.

11:01.589 --> 11:03.518
Oh, so you're being harassed?
Is that it?

11:03.519 --> 11:04.330
You know, you're very lucky.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.000
A less understanding man would
press charges with all the...

11:08.040 --> 11:09.930
inappropriate things
you've said to me.

11:09.931 --> 11:11.560
Really? Like what?

11:12.680 --> 11:15.379
Oh, jeez. How do you even
get in that position?

11:15.380 --> 11:17.000
Right? It's not even possible.

11:17.690 --> 11:19.099
Oh, it's possible.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.920
Okay, gauntlet your right
fist in your left palm.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.379
Shot too soon.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.609
You know, we could always
just cuddle, Castle.

11:26.610 --> 11:28.200
Did you just use the
word "veritable"?

11:28.201 --> 11:29.819
- Yes, I did.
- Sexy.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.050
You should hear me
say "fallacious."

11:31.051 --> 11:33.069
The closest I ever came
to taking an art class

11:33.070 --> 11:35.119
was posing for one as a model.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.769
Wait. Posing in?

11:36.770 --> 11:37.919
Not a stitch.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.110
What's the matter, Castle?
You afraid of a little role play?

11:42.640 --> 11:44.230
That's it? That's all you got?

11:44.390 --> 11:45.939
There's more, but
on thinking back,

11:45.940 --> 11:47.010
I was momentarily distracted

11:47.011 --> 11:50.249
by your dizzying array of
hairstyles over the years.

11:50.250 --> 11:50.770
Anyway...

11:50.771 --> 11:55.039
Oh, Castle, me in a swimsuit under the hot...
blistering sun?

11:55.040 --> 11:56.308
I'd be happy to rub
lotion on you.

11:56.309 --> 11:57.408
You think this is crazy,

11:57.409 --> 11:59.308
you should see some of
the clubs I've been to.

11:59.309 --> 12:00.200
You know any good tricks?

12:00.201 --> 12:02.880
I do this one thing
with ice cubes.

12:03.790 --> 12:07.699
There is one hot... wild...

12:07.700 --> 12:10.140
kinky thing that
I do like doing.

12:11.140 --> 12:14.000
Putting killers behind bars.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.990
Please, let's just stick it
in and get this over with.

12:19.370 --> 12:20.660
That's not how I meant it.

12:20.661 --> 12:23.859
I can't help it if you get off
by putting things in my mouth.

12:23.860 --> 12:26.729
See? Like that.
I can't even-- it's uncanny.

12:26.730 --> 12:29.039
Oh, like you've never
been inappropriate.

12:29.040 --> 12:29.970
Me?

12:30.730 --> 12:32.580
I've never been anything
but a perfect gentleman.

12:32.581 --> 12:33.699
Really?

12:33.700 --> 12:36.839
You ever have any fun?
Let your hair down? Drop your top?

12:36.840 --> 12:38.340
A little "Cops Gone Wild"?

12:38.430 --> 12:40.269
You do know I'm wearing a gun?

12:40.270 --> 12:42.050
Yes, please.
Beat my pants off if you dare.

12:42.051 --> 12:44.310
- Sex?
- I'll explain how that works later.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.268
Slutty nurse.

12:45.269 --> 12:47.070
You're very good at
bossing men around.

12:47.071 --> 12:48.469
I find that hot.

12:48.470 --> 12:50.070
Let me tell you something
about crazy people--

12:50.071 --> 12:52.919
the sex is unbelievable.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.660
Did you call to tell
me a bedtime story?

12:54.661 --> 12:56.969
I would be happy to
let you spank me.

12:56.970 --> 12:58.660
We're handcuffed.

12:59.010 --> 13:00.889
Kinky. Strangely arousing.

13:00.890 --> 13:02.328
You better not be
enjoying this, Castle.

13:02.329 --> 13:03.110
I'll let you know in a minute.

13:03.111 --> 13:05.629
If you are not comfortable in a
swimsuit, you can just skinny-dip.

13:05.630 --> 13:07.979
So I wear boxers.
What do you wear?

13:07.980 --> 13:11.620
Thong? Cheekies? Bloomers?

13:11.740 --> 13:14.840
Granny panties? Commando?

13:15.530 --> 13:18.399
And talk about
unwanted touching?

13:18.400 --> 13:19.580
- Ready?
- Yep.

13:23.550 --> 13:26.829
Okay. I'm gonna go up. Ready?

13:26.830 --> 13:28.370
Grab my legs.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.229
Castle, I said "legs," okay?

13:31.230 --> 13:33.569
Oh, legs. Sorry.

13:33.570 --> 13:36.749
Yeah, but that's simply because
your legs are so close to your...

13:36.750 --> 13:37.410
other bits.

13:37.411 --> 13:40.200
Oh, yeah.
Keep telling yourself that, Castle.

13:47.070 --> 13:48.920
- It's gonna be okay, right?
- Yeah.

13:48.921 --> 13:53.300
Those guys downstairs, they've
done this thousands of times.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.279
Captain Mahoney.
Tactical wants an update.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.319
Well, lack of access is
limiting our options.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.208
What'd you find out about
that handheld remote he had?

14:08.209 --> 14:09.538
It definitely
activated the bomb.

14:09.539 --> 14:11.990
Good news? Tech thinks it
could deactivate it as well.

14:11.991 --> 14:13.990
But we need the
right 5-digit code.

14:14.590 --> 14:16.230
That's, what, a hundred
thousand combinations?

14:16.231 --> 14:18.429
Yeah, and it's tamper proof.

14:18.430 --> 14:20.440
Enter the wrong code, and...

14:24.520 --> 14:25.545
My client says that he's

14:25.546 --> 14:27.340
willing to give you the
disarm code, but...

14:27.341 --> 14:29.660
he has some demands.

14:31.130 --> 14:33.929
Full amnesty?
You gotta be kidding me, right?

14:33.930 --> 14:35.360
This guy killed
someone last night.

14:35.361 --> 14:37.080
Uh, allegedly killed.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.550
Look, I know. I-I told him
that you wouldn't go for it,

14:39.551 --> 14:42.099
but if you haven't noticed,
he's got a screw loose.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.128
I can work on these
other things--

14:43.129 --> 14:45.128
food, clothes, even the phone
isn't impossible, but--

14:45.129 --> 14:46.740
He said he won't go back to prison.
Okay?

14:46.741 --> 14:49.100
He walks or he won't help her.

14:50.050 --> 14:51.689
- Boyer, right?
- Yeah.

14:51.690 --> 14:54.630
You been out of law school,
what, two, three years?

14:54.880 --> 14:57.539
- Ten months.
- Ten months?

14:57.540 --> 14:59.130
- Yeah.
- Okay, listen to me.

14:59.290 --> 15:03.240
That detective standing on that bomb,
she needs to get through this.

15:03.690 --> 15:04.890
You understand me?

15:05.400 --> 15:07.378
Look, I-I swear.
I'm--I'm doing what I can.

15:07.379 --> 15:09.330
All right.
I'll take this list to the DA,

15:09.331 --> 15:11.820
but we're gonna need a plan "B."

15:16.820 --> 15:19.719
The DA's not going for it,
nor should he.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.949
Turning this madman loose on
society to save a single life,

15:22.950 --> 15:26.339
even hers, is against
everything we stand for.

15:26.340 --> 15:29.179
Beckett--she'd be the
first to agree with that.

15:29.180 --> 15:30.188
I'll go back to the lawyer.

15:30.189 --> 15:31.580
See if he can get
through to Fosse.

15:37.740 --> 15:38.841
So I told him that there

15:38.842 --> 15:40.859
was a deal to be had,
just not for amnesty--

15:40.860 --> 15:43.289
- And?
- And he's still insisting he walk.

15:43.290 --> 15:46.240
I figured I'd give him a few
minutes to think and try again.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.269
Detective, I swear, I'm
doing everything I can.

15:49.270 --> 15:50.650
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

15:51.830 --> 15:53.360
Yo, do me a favor?

15:53.480 --> 15:56.249
Why don't you keep Junior over
there busy for me, will you?

15:56.250 --> 15:58.020
I'm gonna go see our
boy in holding.

15:59.080 --> 15:59.850
Why?

15:59.851 --> 16:01.560
You want that code, right?

16:01.870 --> 16:04.320
- Javi, what are you gonna do?
- That's up to him.

16:16.460 --> 16:19.630
Medic!
I need a medic in holding now!

16:31.630 --> 16:33.258
How in the hell did
he get that pen?

16:33.259 --> 16:34.600
That friggin' lawyer
gave it to him.

16:34.601 --> 16:37.189
He was trying to encourage Fosse to
come up with some alternate demands.

16:37.190 --> 16:40.719
And instead he just cost us any
hope of getting that disarm code.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.638
The guy just got out of prison
a couple of months ago.

16:42.639 --> 16:44.748
Why would he start killing people,
and why would he take his own life?

16:44.749 --> 16:46.140
I think I can answer that.

16:46.141 --> 16:48.879
Turns out...
Fosse had stage IV brain cancer.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.059
Found out last month.
He was gonna die anyway.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.450
So if he was dying, why not
take his enemies with him?

16:53.451 --> 16:55.519
Exactly, and his enemies
weren't limited to cops

16:55.520 --> 16:57.169
and last night's bombing victim.

16:57.170 --> 17:00.389
There was another bombing
last week in Connecticut.

17:00.390 --> 17:01.798
That victim worked for the ADA

17:01.799 --> 17:03.720
that put Fosse in
jail six years ago.

17:03.721 --> 17:06.079
Hey, Fosse said,
"I'm not done yet."

17:07.579 --> 17:10.378
Make a list of everyone involved
with the prosecution at his trial.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.869
We need to warn them.
There may be other bombs out there.

17:12.871 --> 17:14.949
And get all the information
on any fragments

17:14.950 --> 17:16.578
that were recovered
from both bombings.

17:16.579 --> 17:18.849
If those bombs were made
with any common components,

17:18.851 --> 17:21.849
it could help BDU deactivate
the device that Beckett's on.

17:27.430 --> 17:30.499
Without the disarm code, we're gonna
need to get eyes on the device.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.469
We use a fiber-optic scope...
go in through the ceiling downstairs.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.568
Is that dangerous?

17:34.569 --> 17:36.690
Well, we'll do everything we
can to minimize the risk.

17:36.691 --> 17:39.029
We'll start across the room,
snake the cable over.

17:39.030 --> 17:41.319
Still, there'll be
some vibrations.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.780
- So there's always a chance that...
- Just do it.

17:44.050 --> 17:45.480
I can't keep standing
here forever.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.540
All right. We'll go as quick as
we can but as slow as we have to.

17:49.170 --> 17:50.070
Thank you.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.430
- Castle, listen to me...
- I'm not leaving.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.570
Look, I know, but depending
on what happens,

17:56.571 --> 17:58.570
there's something that
I need you to do--

17:59.130 --> 18:01.200
something that I
can't do myself.

18:01.470 --> 18:03.638
You need me to hide your porn stash
so your dad doesn't find it?

18:03.639 --> 18:05.020
Could you just be serious
for a second, please?

18:05.021 --> 18:07.120
Okay. What?
What do you need me to do?

18:11.330 --> 18:13.989
Not now, okay?
Just promise me you'll do it.

18:13.990 --> 18:15.208
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

18:15.209 --> 18:16.838
But look, you don't need
to be thinking like this.

18:16.839 --> 18:18.500
I'm just--I'm trying to
be realistic, Castle.

18:18.501 --> 18:20.519
I've been standing
here for hours.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.250
And I'm feeling the
fatigue set in.

18:22.251 --> 18:23.579
Don't think about it.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.399
Beating fatigue is just, um...

18:25.400 --> 18:27.199
it's mind over body.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.629
Escaped POWs have
walked hundreds of miles

18:30.630 --> 18:32.059
to gain their freedom.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.579
Polar explorer Ernest Shackleton

18:34.580 --> 18:37.379
rode in a lifeboat 800
miles to save his crew,

18:37.380 --> 18:38.560
all because of...

18:39.720 --> 18:42.159
You can convince yourself
of almost anything.

18:42.160 --> 18:46.530
Much like you convinced yourself
you weren't crazy about me.

18:47.480 --> 18:48.808
Castle, I know what
you're trying to do.

18:48.809 --> 18:50.210
You're trying to take
my mind off of it.

18:50.211 --> 18:52.529
And I appreciate that, but
do we really have to--

18:52.530 --> 18:56.019
And by the way, you may have
convinced yourself, but...

18:56.020 --> 18:58.229
you weren't fooling
anyone else--

18:58.230 --> 19:00.299
Not me, and certainly
not your friends.

19:00.300 --> 19:03.440
Really? 'Cause no one
ever said anything to me.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.069
Girl, I'm-a smack you.

19:06.070 --> 19:08.509
You work side by side every day.

19:08.510 --> 19:10.468
He writes a sex scene
in his book about you

19:10.469 --> 19:12.430
that had me reaching
for ice water.

19:12.431 --> 19:14.099
Now little Miss Bride shows up.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.850
Don't tell me you're not
the least bit jealous.

19:15.851 --> 19:19.289
Oh, please. You have been
inhaling too many autopsy fluids.

19:19.290 --> 19:22.119
Honey, just because you
can't see what's going on

19:22.120 --> 19:24.969
doesn't mean everyone else
doesn't see what's going on!

19:24.970 --> 19:26.509
Shut up!

19:26.510 --> 19:28.079
He's into you,

19:28.080 --> 19:29.818
but you're determined not to
give in to these feelings

19:29.819 --> 19:31.270
that you clearly have for him.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.889
So he fantasizes about
you through his writing.

19:33.890 --> 19:36.079
It's literally...
verbal masturbation.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.849
No, no, no, no, no. I get it.

19:37.850 --> 19:39.679
You're hot for Castle.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.899
You want to make
little Castle babies.

19:41.900 --> 19:45.320
Despite your little act,
you're crazy about him.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.690
Oh, what? Was that supposed
to be some big secret?

19:49.050 --> 19:50.540
Yes.

19:52.590 --> 19:53.700
No.

19:55.350 --> 19:56.610
Do you think he knows?

20:01.310 --> 20:03.230
He's all yours.

20:15.271 --> 20:16.397
Okay, okay.

20:16.404 --> 20:17.798
They might have said
something, but--

20:18.189 --> 20:20.493
but they were completely
misreading the situation.

20:20.494 --> 20:23.239
Oh. Much like I must have
been misreading the situation

20:23.240 --> 20:26.382
all those times you dressed
up in revealing outfits

20:26.383 --> 20:28.339
to try and, uh, turn my head.

20:34.411 --> 20:35.790
"No one"...

20:51.365 --> 20:53.641
Undercover? I like it.

20:53.642 --> 20:55.618
You might want to pop one
more button, just in case.

21:18.651 --> 21:19.954
Is it just my imagination,

21:19.955 --> 21:20.949
or did you change?

21:20.950 --> 21:23.236
Castle, could you get
some backup, please?

21:23.253 --> 21:23.775
Yeah.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.313
The only reason that
I was dressed up

21:26.314 --> 21:27.744
was to go undercover.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.043
Oh, I guess it was just
a coincidence that...

21:30.301 --> 21:32.844
each time, I just so
happened to be there.

21:32.845 --> 21:34.447
No, it wasn't a coincidence,

21:34.448 --> 21:36.633
because you were always
following me around.

21:36.741 --> 21:38.962
Why? 'Cause you were into me.

21:38.963 --> 21:40.453
- Me into you?
- Yeah.

21:40.454 --> 21:43.988
Mm. I-I admit, I found
you not unattractive

21:43.989 --> 21:45.375
and occasionally...

21:45.389 --> 21:46.571
fun to be around.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.269
But into you? No-mm...

21:49.576 --> 21:51.274
No. Definitely not.

21:51.705 --> 21:53.980
Okay, fine. Then why were
you following me around?

21:53.981 --> 21:55.558
And don't say that
it was research,

21:55.559 --> 21:57.836
because no one believed
that for a second.

21:57.897 --> 21:59.152
You really want to know?

22:00.801 --> 22:02.290
It was because I was...

22:03.733 --> 22:06.297
having so much fun playing cop.

22:13.787 --> 22:15.661
Oh! God! Ohh.

22:21.094 --> 22:23.524
Dead body? Yes!

22:23.525 --> 22:24.706
Drop the gun, dirtbag!

22:24.707 --> 22:26.777
- What did you call me?
- D-dirt-dirtbag.

22:26.778 --> 22:27.718
Boo-yah.

22:27.719 --> 22:29.826
Is there a police code
for zombie on the loose?

22:29.827 --> 22:31.319
I love this case.

22:34.295 --> 22:35.991
Secrets, murder, and gambling--

22:36.406 --> 22:38.099
three of my favorite pastimes.

22:38.234 --> 22:39.167
I got him!

22:39.614 --> 22:40.596
I got him!

22:40.597 --> 22:42.413
Bam!
So you admit that it was you

22:42.414 --> 22:44.518
- who vandalized Wilder's apartment?
- Castle.

22:44.519 --> 22:46.538
I sometimes forget I'm
not actually a cop.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.715
Want me to bust out Jake
and the Fatman again?

22:50.921 --> 22:52.739
I've always wanted to do that!

22:57.470 --> 22:59.755
Drop the gun or I
swear to God, I'll--

23:01.748 --> 23:03.079
Tell me you saw that!

23:03.476 --> 23:04.316
Sorry!

23:10.637 --> 23:11.538
Little help?

23:11.539 --> 23:12.581
That was awesome.

23:12.657 --> 23:14.662
I mean, well, obviously,
it was horrible, but--

23:14.663 --> 23:15.897
I hate this case.

23:15.898 --> 23:17.550
I know. Isn't it great?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.169
Put your hands in the air

23:23.170 --> 23:24.993
and get on your knees
while you're at it!

23:25.793 --> 23:28.115
Gentlemen, if I've
learned one thing,

23:28.116 --> 23:30.421
it's to not let a little
thing like murder

23:30.422 --> 23:32.462
get in the way of
having a good time.

23:33.259 --> 23:34.979
That's not why you were
following me around.

23:34.980 --> 23:35.941
It is, too.

23:35.942 --> 23:38.129
And anything else you
come up with is...

23:38.227 --> 23:40.183
strictly a product
of your imagination.

23:40.184 --> 23:41.380
Well, it's obvious
that you and I

23:41.381 --> 23:42.787
are not gonna resolve this.

23:43.914 --> 23:45.028
So you concede?

23:46.252 --> 23:47.281
Seriously?

23:47.340 --> 23:49.261
- Who liked who first?
- That's right.

23:49.262 --> 23:52.357
- Who was into whom first, me or Castle?
- You do realize

23:52.358 --> 23:54.195
that I'm busy trying
to save your life?

23:54.196 --> 23:55.257
Just answer the question,

23:55.258 --> 23:57.341
Espo, and don't be afraid
to hurt his feelings.

23:57.342 --> 23:59.662
And don't forget about
how jealous she got

23:59.663 --> 24:02.161
that time we worked that case
at my ex-girlfriend's wedding.

24:02.162 --> 24:04.949
Or how jealous he got
when I was with Demming.

24:04.950 --> 24:06.674
Or before that, how
jealous she got about me

24:06.675 --> 24:08.381
- and my ex-wife.
- Who are you talking to?

24:08.382 --> 24:10.165
Or how about when you
wrote that sex scene...

24:10.166 --> 24:11.169
- It's Castle and Beckett.
- In Nikki Heat?

24:11.170 --> 24:13.089
I think they're starting to crack.
Check it out.

24:13.090 --> 24:15.849
Or, uh, jealous about
me and Serena Kaye,

24:15.850 --> 24:17.393
or Sophia from the CIA,

24:17.394 --> 24:19.200
or Agent Shaw from the FBI.

24:19.201 --> 24:21.607
Yeah, wow. Totally losing it.

24:21.712 --> 24:23.378
Listen, I ran down
the bomb fragments

24:23.379 --> 24:24.709
from Fosse's previous attacks.

24:24.710 --> 24:26.760
The components he used
were completely different.

24:26.761 --> 24:27.631
They're not gonna be any help

24:27.632 --> 24:29.231
in determining what this
third bomb is like.

24:29.232 --> 24:31.362
- So it's up to BDU now.
- Yeah.

24:59.097 --> 25:00.406
Oh, God.

25:01.728 --> 25:03.251
There's a timer, too.

25:13.705 --> 25:15.205
Seems like the timer
was activated

25:15.206 --> 25:17.328
when she stepped on
that triggering plate.

25:17.329 --> 25:19.754
Okay.
Well, how much time is left?

25:19.755 --> 25:22.147
30 minutes and 47 seconds.

25:25.266 --> 25:26.535
All right. Um...

25:27.474 --> 25:28.504
Well...

25:28.505 --> 25:30.128
Can we deactivate it by then?

25:30.129 --> 25:31.148
We'll try.

25:31.235 --> 25:32.766
Trouble is, our usual targets--

25:32.767 --> 25:34.791
the fuse, the detonator,
the timing pin--

25:34.792 --> 25:36.608
they're all shielded
by a steel plate.

25:36.609 --> 25:38.167
Well, there's gotta be
something we can do.

25:38.168 --> 25:40.387
We could line the
floor with armor.

25:40.388 --> 25:42.358
I could just put on one of
those "Hurt Locker" suits.

25:42.359 --> 25:43.900
I could tackle her
right off of it.

25:43.901 --> 25:45.879
Castle, if that thing goes off,

25:45.880 --> 25:47.142
the whole building's
going with it.

25:47.143 --> 25:48.732
There's not a suit in the
world that's gonna--

25:48.733 --> 25:50.326
Hey, Castle. What's going on?

25:51.270 --> 25:52.756
Uh, be right there.

25:53.663 --> 25:55.624
I promise we'll do
all that we can.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.147
But I urge you to be realistic--

25:57.148 --> 25:59.006
Okay, thank you.
Captain, thank you.

26:03.425 --> 26:04.511
What did he say?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.400
Good news.
They've isolated the bomb.

26:06.401 --> 26:08.475
And they're deploying their
bomb disposal robot.

26:08.476 --> 26:10.861
It's a new prototype
model with advanced AI.

26:10.862 --> 26:13.330
They've had a lot of success
in field simulations. It's...

26:14.587 --> 26:15.439
What?

26:15.440 --> 26:16.932
A prototype robot?

26:18.474 --> 26:19.934
I can tell when
you're lying, Castle.

26:19.935 --> 26:20.850
You know that.

26:20.851 --> 26:22.378
Like when you said
that you were...

26:22.605 --> 26:24.245
following me just to play cop.

26:24.246 --> 26:25.612
Now what did he actually say?

26:28.225 --> 26:29.483
There's a timer on the bomb.

26:32.183 --> 26:33.268
How long?

26:34.111 --> 26:35.347
About 30 minutes.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.305
Yeah, well, it's
probably just as well.

26:42.306 --> 26:43.856
I can't keep standing
here anyway.

26:43.857 --> 26:45.618
Hey, we will get
you out of this.

26:45.650 --> 26:47.097
And what makes you so sure?

26:47.322 --> 26:49.627
We've been in bad
situations before.

26:50.577 --> 26:51.918
Now here's what's gonna happen.

26:52.362 --> 26:55.252
We're just gonna stroll
on over to the elevator,

26:55.253 --> 26:56.319
together.

26:56.628 --> 27:00.255
You make a sound, and I'll put
a round in this man's liver,

27:00.256 --> 27:01.992
and he will die slowly.

27:03.350 --> 27:07.631
How close to death
do you want to get?

27:12.023 --> 27:13.133
Castle!

27:13.134 --> 27:14.335
Are you watching?

27:14.381 --> 27:15.796
I got your girl!

27:28.810 --> 27:30.519
I feel, in situations like this,

27:30.520 --> 27:32.051
it's important to have faith.

27:32.642 --> 27:33.800
Help!

27:34.010 --> 27:35.372
Castle!

27:37.520 --> 27:38.645
Castle,

27:39.257 --> 27:40.521
thank you...

27:41.568 --> 27:42.918
for being there.

27:46.145 --> 27:47.268
Always.

27:49.765 --> 27:51.089
Yeah, there is
something about us

27:51.090 --> 27:53.208
- that seems to draw in trouble.
- Mm-hmm.

27:53.319 --> 27:55.751
But you're forgetting the
scariest one of them all.

27:58.646 --> 28:00.401
Richard, I'm home!

28:00.402 --> 28:01.876
- Oh, my God.
- Aah!

28:03.054 --> 28:05.218
Darling, we need to talk.

28:05.336 --> 28:06.189
Hide.

28:06.396 --> 28:07.672
- What?
- Hide.

28:07.743 --> 28:09.185
- Are you serious?
- Get in the closet.

28:09.186 --> 28:10.415
No, I'm not going in the closet.

28:10.416 --> 28:11.661
- Get in the closet.
- Ooh!

28:13.189 --> 28:13.862
What's going on?

28:13.863 --> 28:14.992
I'm just...

28:15.236 --> 28:16.514
making the bed.

28:16.599 --> 28:17.539
Oh.

28:18.913 --> 28:20.640
That was terrifying.

28:20.966 --> 28:22.163
But still,

28:22.164 --> 28:24.875
as bad as the situation gets,
we always find a way out.

28:25.034 --> 28:25.761
Okay, fine.

28:25.762 --> 28:27.599
So how are we gonna find
our way out of this one?

28:27.600 --> 28:30.729
I keep thinking the answer
is in Fosse's story.

28:30.730 --> 28:34.115
I mean, something must have set him off.
But what?

28:34.116 --> 28:35.987
Castle, why does
his story matter?

28:35.988 --> 28:36.984
The story always matters.

28:36.985 --> 28:39.696
That's actually why we
make such a great team.

28:39.699 --> 28:40.788
You find the evidence,

28:40.789 --> 28:42.563
evidence helps me build a story,

28:42.564 --> 28:45.301
the story points us
to the solution.

28:46.390 --> 28:47.493
The key card.

28:48.068 --> 28:49.094
Mike's key card!

28:49.095 --> 28:50.010
Scarlett gave it to him

28:50.011 --> 28:51.992
so that the two of them could
go into business together.

28:51.993 --> 28:53.880
Making for one
angry blackmailer.

28:53.881 --> 28:55.664
And as long as he's alive,
he's a threat to Dahl.

28:55.665 --> 28:57.133
She was in on it from the start.

28:57.134 --> 28:58.653
Yes. How did you know?

28:58.654 --> 29:00.272
I was thinking the
exact same thing.

29:00.273 --> 29:02.453
I think I figured out who
Zalman was paid to kill.

29:02.454 --> 29:04.643
Billionaire philanthropist
Christian Dahl?

29:04.644 --> 29:06.377
It's like we could be twins.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.083
I think I know who
the killer is.

29:08.084 --> 29:09.467
- Him.
- What?

29:09.468 --> 29:10.721
He lied?

29:10.722 --> 29:12.358
The con is still on!

29:12.397 --> 29:13.308
There!

29:13.576 --> 29:14.953
I know who the killer is!

29:14.954 --> 29:17.392
Do you two practice this
when we're not around?

29:19.050 --> 29:20.582
See? The story--

29:20.912 --> 29:22.290
it's our secret ingredient.

29:22.291 --> 29:24.312
Except when your
storytelling devolves

29:24.313 --> 29:25.762
into wild speculation.

29:25.763 --> 29:27.120
Then it's just maddening.

29:27.121 --> 29:29.741
Hey, that wild speculation

29:29.752 --> 29:32.142
almost always points
us to our killer.

29:32.601 --> 29:35.236
You know what I don't get, is
who would steal a dead body?

29:35.237 --> 29:36.516
Organ harvesters.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.207
Cadaverless med students.

29:38.249 --> 29:39.200
Satanists.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.736
Mad scientists looking to
create their own monster.

29:41.968 --> 29:43.741
The bullet was made of ice.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.584
Gun-toting viking,
that's your theory?

29:45.585 --> 29:47.880
Or he's a vampire.
Recently fired postal workers.

29:47.881 --> 29:49.539
Here I am, looking for evidence,

29:49.540 --> 29:51.871
and all I had to do was
just make something up.

29:51.872 --> 29:53.556
The clock was commissioned
by a secret society

29:53.557 --> 29:55.220
to countdown the end of days--

29:55.221 --> 29:58.078
a secret society of Santas,

29:58.103 --> 29:59.680
who are the guardians of time.

29:59.681 --> 30:01.943
Oh-ho! Oh, that's good.

30:01.964 --> 30:03.084
Don't say spy.

30:03.679 --> 30:04.898
Or mob hit.

30:05.215 --> 30:06.406
Mob hit of a spy?

30:06.953 --> 30:07.985
Ninja assassin.

30:07.986 --> 30:09.756
Mad doctors and B-movie Nazis.

30:09.757 --> 30:10.802
Time-traveling killer.

30:10.803 --> 30:11.766
Maybe...

30:14.493 --> 30:15.416
No, I got nothing.

30:15.417 --> 30:16.995
A mummy himself has
risen from the grave

30:16.996 --> 30:18.662
and is roaming New York
seeking vengeance.

30:18.663 --> 30:21.422
Ooh. That'd be cool, if
it was actually a ghost.

30:21.423 --> 30:24.021
Don't ruin my story
with your logic.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.187
The actual DVD will not
kill me, Esposito.

30:26.188 --> 30:28.863
It will be the spirit
inside the DVD,

30:28.864 --> 30:30.229
just like in "The Ring."

30:30.230 --> 30:32.286
Yeah, that's the stupidest
thing you said yet.

30:32.287 --> 30:34.595
So a killer cyborg
sent from the future,

30:34.596 --> 30:36.392
resistance fighters
intercept his coordinates,

30:36.393 --> 30:38.920
redirect him into a pizza
oven, saving humanity.

30:41.902 --> 30:44.226
Who needs proof?
What a great story.

30:44.769 --> 30:45.623
Men In Black.

30:46.122 --> 30:48.530
The psychic predicted
her own murder?

30:48.876 --> 30:50.043
The killer's a zombie.

30:51.381 --> 30:52.812
I said "almost always."

30:52.813 --> 30:54.672
But in this case, we're not
trying to catch our killer.

30:54.673 --> 30:55.846
Fosse's already dead.

30:56.848 --> 30:58.009
You know what bugs me?

30:58.498 --> 31:00.295
Why would a guy on
a bombing spree

31:00.296 --> 31:02.666
be worried about selling his
baseball card collection?

31:02.752 --> 31:03.691
He wouldn't.

31:04.896 --> 31:05.623
Do you think that Fosse

31:05.624 --> 31:07.039
was trying to lure
the collector here?

31:07.040 --> 31:09.334
Yeah, I'd say so, seeing
as how this receipt says

31:09.335 --> 31:11.930
he just bought this
collection a week ago.

31:11.969 --> 31:13.545
That card collector was
going down to the station

31:13.546 --> 31:14.557
to make a statement, right?

31:14.558 --> 31:16.949
Yes, yes. If he's still there,
maybe Ryan and Esposito

31:16.950 --> 31:19.333
- can figure out what Fosse wanted with him.
- Already on it.

31:19.334 --> 31:20.575
You're sure you never
met him before?

31:20.576 --> 31:21.960
- No previous interactions?
- No.

31:21.961 --> 31:23.632
He friended me on
Facebook a few weeks ago,

31:23.633 --> 31:25.064
saw me posting about
some trading cards,

31:25.065 --> 31:26.722
said he has some old ones
for me to take a look at.

31:26.723 --> 31:28.628
How about any connection to
his trial, even indirectly?

31:28.629 --> 31:30.519
Maybe your job's related to
the legal field somehow.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.742
I'm an administrator for
NYSED up in Albany.

31:32.743 --> 31:33.414
This is the first time

31:33.415 --> 31:34.809
I've even been to
the city in years.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.075
Okay, what about his victims,
Jeffrey Sklar, Kelly Runther?

31:37.076 --> 31:38.266
Any connection to them?

31:38.326 --> 31:39.955
Sorry.
I've never seen them before.

31:39.956 --> 31:42.511
What about this list of names
connected to the Fosse trial?

31:42.512 --> 31:44.485
Do any of those names
look familiar?

31:44.634 --> 31:46.451
Look again.
We're running out of time.

31:46.821 --> 31:49.430
I want to help. I do.
But I don't know anything.

31:50.750 --> 31:53.370
Yeah. No, I under--I understand.
Thank you, Esposito.

31:55.312 --> 31:56.466
Detective Beckett.

31:58.652 --> 32:00.022
Ten minutes. I know.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.439
It's okay, Captain.
You did everything you could.

32:08.503 --> 32:09.651
We are not giving up.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.241
There'll be guys down
there working on this

32:11.242 --> 32:12.997
till the last possible moment.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.146
But I have to withdraw
everybody else,

32:17.104 --> 32:19.349
- and that includes you, Castle.
- Could I just...

32:19.866 --> 32:21.848
Could I have a moment
alone with him, please?

32:22.402 --> 32:23.509
Of course.

32:31.182 --> 32:32.546
It's time to say good-bye.

32:33.651 --> 32:34.863
I'm not leaving.

32:34.955 --> 32:37.481
Castle, you promised that you
would help me with something

32:37.482 --> 32:38.659
when the time came.

32:40.169 --> 32:41.196
This is it.

32:41.684 --> 32:43.831
- Beckett, no.
- Please, Castle.

32:43.832 --> 32:46.460
Please don't make this any
harder than it needs to be.

32:50.609 --> 32:52.208
I-I wish I could...

32:53.067 --> 32:53.932
kiss you.

32:53.933 --> 32:54.985
I wish...

32:57.296 --> 32:58.486
so many things.

32:58.707 --> 32:59.679
No.

32:59.774 --> 33:01.157
There's no regrets.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.590
All in all, I think
we've had a great run.

33:12.689 --> 33:13.912
You should go.

33:21.295 --> 33:22.366
Rick.

33:26.782 --> 33:27.986
I love you.

33:31.164 --> 33:32.311
I love you, too.

34:15.891 --> 34:17.647
You've reached the voice
mail of Jim Beckett.

34:17.648 --> 34:18.809
Please leave a message.

34:20.080 --> 34:20.976
Hey, dad, it's me.

34:20.978 --> 34:23.293
I just wanted to hear
your voice and...

34:25.049 --> 34:26.882
I wanted to tell you
that I love you.

34:30.404 --> 34:31.596
Okay, that's all.

34:32.695 --> 34:33.844
Bye.

34:44.342 --> 34:45.628
We speak for the dead.

34:47.036 --> 34:48.152
That's the job.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.507
We are all they've got

34:50.509 --> 34:53.138
once the wicked rob
them of their voices.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.199
We owe them that.

34:56.940 --> 34:58.595
But we don't owe 'em our lives.

35:00.614 --> 35:02.544
Your mother always
said that life

35:03.134 --> 35:05.557
never delivers anything
that we can't handle.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.104
Let me take you someplace, Kate.

35:08.991 --> 35:10.586
Someplace you'll be safe.

35:11.097 --> 35:12.621
I'll never be safe.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.725
There are no victories.

35:15.817 --> 35:17.419
There's only the battle.

35:17.420 --> 35:18.586
And the best that
you could hope for

35:18.587 --> 35:22.349
is that you find someplace
where you can make your stand.

35:22.567 --> 35:24.609
I wish that I had someone

35:24.610 --> 35:27.414
who would be there for me, and
I could be there for him,

35:27.415 --> 35:29.775
and we could just dive
into it together.

35:30.018 --> 35:31.260
Even on the worst days,

35:31.261 --> 35:33.373
there's a possibility for joy.

35:36.859 --> 35:37.993
Kate!

35:40.067 --> 35:41.376
I almost died,

35:42.182 --> 35:44.223
and all I could think
about was you.

35:45.347 --> 35:46.743
I just want you.

35:54.135 --> 35:55.415
Don't die on me!

35:59.326 --> 35:59.920
Come on!

35:59.921 --> 36:01.107
Switch. We got this.

36:04.688 --> 36:06.740
- Pulse ox... 
- Set up for intubation.

36:10.899 --> 36:12.112
Kate.

36:12.407 --> 36:13.503
I love you.

36:14.666 --> 36:15.955
I love you, Kate.

36:20.117 --> 36:21.544
Hey. What are you doing?

36:21.545 --> 36:23.406
Napping?
'Cause I can come back later.

36:24.329 --> 36:25.339
Castle, what are you doing here?

36:25.340 --> 36:26.413
You promised.

36:26.414 --> 36:27.451
Yeah, I promised I'd leave,

36:27.452 --> 36:29.259
but I didn't promise I
wouldn't come back.

36:29.330 --> 36:31.174
I got coffee--later-- for
when you're off that thing.

36:31.175 --> 36:33.085
No, Castle, please.
You have to leave now.

36:33.086 --> 36:34.785
There's no reason for
both of us to die.

36:34.786 --> 36:37.347
Oh, I didn't come here to die.
I came here to defuse the bomb.

36:37.348 --> 36:38.127
There's still a chance.

36:38.128 --> 36:41.207
- Yes, a 1 in 100,000 chance.
- Great.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.095
While there's still a
chance, I'm not giving up.

36:43.096 --> 36:44.497
Castle, listen to me.

36:44.642 --> 36:46.178
I've already come
to peace with this,

36:46.179 --> 36:48.114
and that doesn't include
Alexis losing her father

36:48.115 --> 36:49.222
or Martha her son.

36:49.223 --> 36:51.236
Come on. What am I supposed
to do, walk out the door

36:51.237 --> 36:53.145
while you're standing all the
way over there by yourself?

36:53.146 --> 36:54.908
Yes. Yes, that's exactly--

36:54.909 --> 36:55.980
Wait a second.

36:57.332 --> 36:59.221
Why are you standing all
the way over there?

37:00.047 --> 37:02.396
If Fosse set the bomb
for the cops, why not--

37:03.054 --> 37:05.983
why not set it by the door so
they'd hit is as they came in?

37:05.984 --> 37:07.623
Unless-- this wasn't for cops.

37:08.117 --> 37:09.138
Then who was it for?

37:09.139 --> 37:11.152
The card collector kid--
what was his name?

37:11.153 --> 37:12.535
Diego.
He was on his way up here.

37:12.536 --> 37:14.442
Maybe Fosse was trying to
leverage him for information.

37:14.443 --> 37:15.377
Okay, great.

37:15.378 --> 37:17.934
So, uh, what's near
where you're standing?

37:17.935 --> 37:19.646
The island, cards,

37:19.887 --> 37:20.504
computer.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.225
Castle, I think I can reach
that computer from here.

37:22.226 --> 37:24.123
You stay there.
I'll--I'll check it.

37:25.398 --> 37:26.585
Do you think Fosse wanted Diego

37:26.586 --> 37:27.446
to look something up?

37:27.447 --> 37:28.631
Maybe, but what?

37:28.782 --> 37:30.401
Checking the browser
history--porn...

37:30.674 --> 37:31.640
more porn,

37:32.230 --> 37:33.825
web sites for a couple of PIs,

37:33.826 --> 37:35.332
peopletracker.pro.

37:36.304 --> 37:37.225
He's looking for someone.

37:37.226 --> 37:37.909
Maybe it was someone else

37:37.910 --> 37:39.963
that he held responsible
for putting him in prison.

37:39.964 --> 37:42.089
You can find practically anyone
with the click of a mouse.

37:42.090 --> 37:43.933
Why hire a private investigator?

37:44.740 --> 37:46.080
I think I might have
an answer for you.

37:46.081 --> 37:47.056
I went through the
list of all the people

37:47.057 --> 37:48.388
involved in Fosse's trial.

37:48.389 --> 37:51.442
One woman's been completely
scrubbed from the system.

37:51.443 --> 37:52.429
Driver's license,

37:52.430 --> 37:54.205
social security
number-- all gone.

37:54.206 --> 37:55.175
Who was that?

37:55.711 --> 37:57.138
Dorothy Novak.

37:57.139 --> 37:58.789
The prosecution's main witness,

37:58.790 --> 38:00.223
and Fosse's girlfriend
at the time.

38:00.224 --> 38:01.902
The DA just confirmed,
his office set her up

38:01.903 --> 38:04.603
with a new identity when Fosse
got out three months ago.

38:04.604 --> 38:06.357
She was afraid Fosse
would come after her.

38:06.358 --> 38:07.638
Looks like she was right.

38:07.826 --> 38:10.125
Okay, but how is
this Diego Jiminez

38:10.126 --> 38:11.897
- supposed to help find her?
- Don't know.

38:11.898 --> 38:13.897
He worked at the NYSED.

38:14.091 --> 38:15.898
New York State
Education Department.

38:16.914 --> 38:17.447
Wait.

38:17.448 --> 38:19.595
Were the first two victims
related to Fosse's girlfriend?

38:19.596 --> 38:21.006
Yeah, the woman he
killed last night

38:21.007 --> 38:22.099
was the girlfriend's cousin.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.122
And the first victim worked
for the DA's office.

38:24.123 --> 38:26.090
- They helped relocate her.
- Fosse didn't want revenge.

38:26.091 --> 38:27.989
He was looking for
information from them.

38:27.990 --> 38:29.954
He wanted to find out his
girlfriend's new identity.

38:29.955 --> 38:31.404
He was desperate to find them.

38:31.405 --> 38:32.141
Castle.

38:32.142 --> 38:33.820
Right there with you.
Does she have a kid?

38:33.821 --> 38:36.369
Yeah. She gave birth eight
months after the trial.

38:36.370 --> 38:37.267
How did you know?

38:37.268 --> 38:39.644
It's his. He didn't find out
about it until he got out.

38:39.645 --> 38:41.408
And that's why he
lured Diego here.

38:41.409 --> 38:43.554
Diego had access to
state school records.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.986
He was trying to find his kid.
It was all about fi--

38:47.267 --> 38:48.342
That's the code.

38:48.909 --> 38:49.924
It has to be.

38:49.925 --> 38:51.579
Ryan, see if you can
find the kid's name.

38:51.580 --> 38:52.290
Working on it.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.955
Okay, work fast, buddy.
We got two minutes.

38:55.490 --> 38:56.899
It's a story that makes sense.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.930
Fosse was desperate
to see his kid

38:58.931 --> 39:00.293
just once before he dies,

39:00.294 --> 39:01.453
but the mother has
hidden the child away.

39:01.454 --> 39:02.797
So Fosse lashed out,

39:02.798 --> 39:04.984
doing whatever it took
to track them down.

39:05.268 --> 39:06.508
Told you we'd figure this out.

39:06.509 --> 39:07.972
Castle, there's
barely a minute left.

39:07.973 --> 39:09.309
- You've gotta go.
- Not yet.

39:09.310 --> 39:11.906
Please. If he finds the name,
I'll type it in myself.

39:11.907 --> 39:14.073
- If not--
- He'll come through.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.400
He has to.

39:29.908 --> 39:30.588
William.

39:30.589 --> 39:31.811
The kid's name is William.

39:32.233 --> 39:33.359
Seven letters.

39:35.178 --> 39:36.216
Billy.

39:36.217 --> 39:37.573
Or Willy.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.870
What kind of mother is
gonna call her kid Willy

39:39.871 --> 39:41.950
unless she wants his ass kicked
every day at the playground?

39:41.951 --> 39:44.269
Guys, 15 seconds.

39:44.592 --> 39:46.036
Your call, Beckett.

39:46.037 --> 39:46.932
Billy. Go.

39:46.933 --> 39:48.755
B-i-l-l...

40:04.595 --> 40:05.692
Oh, God.

40:05.859 --> 40:06.682
She's off.

40:06.683 --> 40:08.374
- She's off.
- Yes.

40:20.128 --> 40:21.796
Wait, Castle. Listen...

40:22.846 --> 40:24.640
Thank you for staying with me.

40:25.076 --> 40:26.055
Always.

40:37.507 --> 40:38.568
Perfect timing.

40:39.154 --> 40:39.767
You good?

40:39.768 --> 40:41.042
- Yeah. Did she see?
- No.

40:41.043 --> 40:44.287
Glad to see you, Detective.
Even you, Mr. Castle.

40:44.288 --> 40:45.320
I have to say,

40:45.321 --> 40:48.217
I don't know too many men who
would've done what you did.

40:48.220 --> 40:49.244
Neither do I.

40:52.881 --> 40:54.707
Oh, for heaven's
sake, Detective.

40:54.708 --> 40:56.547
Just kiss the man.

40:58.840 --> 40:59.849
Sir, you know?

41:00.406 --> 41:01.343
What...

41:01.344 --> 41:02.832
Do you think I'm an idiot?

41:03.535 --> 41:06.247
I needed to maintain
plausible deniability,

41:06.248 --> 41:07.786
which I can continue

41:07.847 --> 41:10.639
as long as you two both act
professionally at the precinct.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.915
I know I can.

41:11.916 --> 41:13.382
But, Captain, she
has a long history

41:13.383 --> 41:14.468
of coming on to me at work--

41:14.469 --> 41:15.916
I don't think it'll
be a problem, Sir.

41:15.917 --> 41:16.641
Good.

41:16.642 --> 41:19.161
Meanwhile, as long as we're
on neutral ground here,

41:19.162 --> 41:22.179
I'd say, uh, he deserves it.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.102
Wouldn't you?

41:23.285 --> 41:24.547
Yes, Sir, I would.

41:28.989 --> 41:31.253
You know, Castle, when I
was standing up there,

41:31.254 --> 41:33.775
I kept thinking about all
the times we've kissed.

41:34.572 --> 41:36.634
And I was trying to
decide on the best one.

41:39.257 --> 41:40.440
And what do you think?

42:15.686 --> 42:17.596
