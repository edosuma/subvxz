WEBVTT

00:08.039 --> 00:09.883
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.960 --> 00:11.564
Peg, you work
at the phone company.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.130
You know how busy
the office keeps me.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.608
Agent Carter, cover the phones.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.204
As of this moment,
Howard Stark is a fugitive from justice.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.362
I have a vault.
Somebody cleaned me out.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.329
<i>My technology
in the hands of some nut.</i>

00:23.400 --> 00:25.129
<i>You have no idea
how bad that could be.</i>

00:27.520 --> 00:29.602
Edwin Jarvis.
He'll help you in any way he can.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.128
<i>Leviathan is coming.</i>

00:33.080 --> 00:34.081
Where are you?

00:34.160 --> 00:35.161
Keep driving!

00:49.040 --> 00:50.644
And now it's time for

00:50.720 --> 00:53.291
<i>The Captain America
Adventure Program,</i>

00:53.360 --> 00:55.681
brought to you by Roxxon Motor Oil.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.326
Tonight's thrilling tale

00:57.400 --> 01:00.244
takes us deep into the heart
of the Ardennes forest,

01:00.320 --> 01:04.405
where Hitler's Nazi guard
have ambushed the 107th Infantry

01:04.480 --> 01:06.084
and taken Betty Carver,

01:06.160 --> 01:07.969
the battalion's beautiful triage nurse...

01:08.440 --> 01:10.568
-...as their hostage.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.401
You lousy krauts are in big trouble

01:13.480 --> 01:16.006
once Captain America gets here.

01:16.480 --> 01:17.811
When I'm through with you, Hitler,

01:17.880 --> 01:21.168
you're gonna be seeing stars
and stripes!

01:23.040 --> 01:26.522
Nein! <i>You will bow down to the</i> FÃ¼hrer!

01:27.000 --> 01:28.331
Here.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.761
- Angie, would you mind changing that?
- Oh, you bet.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.491
Arlene French beat me out for that part.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.447
"You lousy krauts are in big trouble
once Captain America gets here."

01:38.520 --> 01:39.851
It's better, right?

01:39.920 --> 01:41.126
Thrillingly realistic.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.250
You moving?

01:46.320 --> 01:47.970
I, uh, lost my roommate.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.010
My first place,
I lived with this girl from Queens.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.286
It was okay for maybe six months,

01:52.360 --> 01:54.408
and then... Bam!
One day, she's engaged.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.608
Next day,
she's married and living in Armonk.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.529
You think you know people.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.240
"Cozy studio apartment."
That means it's a broom closet.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.845
"Convenient to public transportation..."

02:03.920 --> 02:05.570
You'll be living under
the Third Avenue El.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.880
What would you suggest?

02:07.240 --> 02:08.479
Girl down the hall from me
just moved out.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.526
Couldn't hack it, I guess.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.409
She was always crying
to her mother on the hall phone.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.960
- Oh, poor thing.
- Yeah, maybe the first couple times.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.804
Anyway, it's over on 63rd.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.644
It's real safe, lots of great girls.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.007
Plus, I'd be your neighbor,
so that's not nothing.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.401
Oh, it's a lovely idea,
but I'd hate for you to grow tired of me.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.571
You don't strike me as the
"crying on the hall phone" type, English.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.522
I appreciate it, truly, but, um...

02:34.600 --> 02:36.284
I'm actually on my way
to see an apartment now.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.771
At this hour?

02:37.840 --> 02:39.968
You sure you're reading
the right kind of want-ads?

02:40.040 --> 02:41.405
It comes recommended
through a friend.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.686
If you say so.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.691
You presumably
already noticed

02:48.760 --> 02:50.762
the North German
Renaissance influences,

02:50.840 --> 02:53.525
but the layout is decidedly French.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.170
Fresh fruit and scones
served every morning.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.287
Ooh!

02:56.360 --> 02:58.283
The chef likes a challenge,
so you may order anything you like.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.601
- I can't stay.
- Mr. Stark insisted.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.967
He also wants me to clear his name
on multiple charges of treason.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.611
If anyone finds out I'm living in his
house, I'll be fitted for the noose.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.364
Well, if it puts you at your ease,

03:07.440 --> 03:10.011
this isn't one of his primary residences.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.323
Mr. Stark uses this more for
private entertaining.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.964
It's too risky.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.691
Well, if you're certain you wouldn't like
to see the master bedroom...

03:23.720 --> 03:24.767
Oh!

03:27.640 --> 03:30.246
- Russian sable, custom-made.
- Oh.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.971
- Perhaps one night.
- Splendid.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.887
Regarding our other matter,
I checked through Mr. Stark's files

03:35.960 --> 03:37.530
but found no mention of Leviathan.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.768
I couldn't find anything
at the SSR, either.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.129
What about the two gentlemen
with the unusual...

03:42.240 --> 03:44.720
New York hospitals have no
record of laryngotomy patients

03:44.800 --> 03:47.724
fitting those descriptions
within the last three years.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.450
I think those quiet men
are from out of town.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.286
Hmm.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.730
So, I've got two foreign agents
with no voice boxes

03:54.800 --> 03:57.849
fighting over a milk truck
full of experimental implosives.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.925
Just another day at the office.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.411
Oh, I wish.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.244
The Daisy Clover Dairy opens at 5:00.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.084
We need to find that milk truck.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.242
I'll be standing by with a car at 10 to.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.004
You've nearly been killed once,
Mr. Jarvis.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.605
Others have been less fortunate.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.170
I think it's best I should carry on alone.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.321
Oh.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.801
On occasion, Mr. Stark enjoys

04:19.880 --> 04:22.326
adding a theatrical element
to his romantic endeavors.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.004
Is that what he calls it?

04:24.080 --> 04:26.082
Oh! Yes, this could prove useful.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.684
Oh, don't be lewd.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.647
The maid arrives at 10:00,
the florist usually by noon.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.085
Cancel them both.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.730
And I shall cancel them both.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.251
- Good night, Mr. Jarvis.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.009
I do wish you'd change your mind
and allow me to accompany you.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.286
I can be your second pair of eyes.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.203
I can't imagine there being
much danger at the dairy hub.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.611
I'm only going to hunt a truck.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.001
Whoever drove that truck is a man
that needs questioning. Good night.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.684
And how do you plan to find it?

05:36.760 --> 05:38.842
I held on to the Vita-Ray
detector from Project Rebirth.

05:38.920 --> 05:39.921
It should still pick up a reading

05:40.000 --> 05:41.923
from whatever truck was used
to transport the Nitramene.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.566
What?

05:45.240 --> 05:47.481
It seems a tad conspicuous
to walk into Daisy Clover

05:47.560 --> 05:49.767
and halt business to inspect
for vita-radiation.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.411
I can assure you, I have far more tact
than you give me credit...

05:52.480 --> 05:54.687
Oh. You've popped a button.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.091
No.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.360
Good night, Mr. Jarvis.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.289
Well, what's the worst that can happen?

06:20.960 --> 06:23.201
Please! I'll tell you
anything you want to know!

06:27.600 --> 06:29.204
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.851
I swear to God,
I don't know no Leet Brannis!

06:38.960 --> 06:40.689
Is it a person or a place?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.602
Oh, no. No, no, no.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.411
I told Spider I didn't want
anything to do with that stuff.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.925
It's too hot, too pricy.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.890
I told him Gino DeLucia
out in Bensonhurst.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.849
He'd buy it.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.969
- Y'all done there?
- Yeah.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.405
Ready to go!

07:56.480 --> 07:58.528
Excuse me! Are you the foreman?

07:58.600 --> 07:59.681
Who's askin'?

07:59.760 --> 08:01.489
Ruth Barton,
City of New York Health Department.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.891
- You heard of that?
- Yes.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.525
Well, you have not been acting like it.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.490
I've had 15 complaints that
you are under direct violation

08:07.560 --> 08:09.847
of city health provision 42, article 23,

08:09.920 --> 08:12.002
i.e., the care and transport
of all milkstuffs.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.844
- Complaints from who?
- Right now, me.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.729
I have a court order
to inspect all delivery trucks

08:15.800 --> 08:17.006
in this distribution hub.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.242
Let's hope I don't find cheese
where the milk's supposed to be.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.731
Now, you gonna help me or hinder me?

08:21.320 --> 08:22.685
- Help?
- Good answer.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.206
There's a truck missing.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.731
Well, we got a guy out sick
the past two days.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.131
He uses his truck to commute.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.163
Has he never heard of a bus?
Name and address.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.810
Sheldon McFee,
but I don't got an address.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.090
Leave that to me.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.088
And put some air in that tire!

09:26.760 --> 09:29.047
Well, here's what's left of Roxxon.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.282
Makes even less sense
in the light of day.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.488
An entire chemical refinery
squashed into that.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.605
I never seen anything like it.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.848
This is scary stuff, gentlemen...

09:37.920 --> 09:40.924
The kind of technology that could give
the A-bomb a run for its money.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.650
We need to find it fast.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.524
You think it's magnets?

09:46.080 --> 09:47.161
What?

09:47.960 --> 09:50.884
You got steel fused with wood
fused with iron fused with concrete.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.645
Last time I checked, stone and wood
don't carry a magnetic charge.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.644
Well, excuse me, Sir Isaac Newton.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.927
That's gravity, you dumb ape.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.365
Well, what do you think did it?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.291
I think Howard Stark did it.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.406
Come on. We're going to Roxxon.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.165
Nobody burns down your house
by accident.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.124
Not you, Krzeminski.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.727
I got a special detail for a man
with your skills.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.408
Grab a crowbar. Pull that thing apart.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.970
Find me some evidence.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.168
Aw. You got to be kidding me.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.802
I see. Perfect.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.451
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.604
Whitby's Prospect, third race.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.886
You sure?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.002
Not at all.
That's why they call it gambling.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.285
I need to pop out for a minute,
personal matters.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.368
- Cover for me?
- Sure thing, but you owe me one.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.885
Got that film developed for you.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.769
Hey, thanks a bunch.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.005
Photographer from the society pages
was at Spider Raymond's club.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.650
Says he may have got
a shot of the blonde

11:07.720 --> 11:09.245
who was with Spider
before he got killed.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.608
Well, that would be a big break.
Can I help you look?

11:17.960 --> 11:19.291
I thought you were leaving.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.689
Sousa! Need you in the basement.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.761
I'm busy.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.365
Well, now you're extra busy.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.205
I got a 10-ton ball of Roxxon garbage
with your name on it.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.408
All right, all right, give me a minute.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.086
Carter, finish up those transpo reports
and file them for me.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.166
Carter!

11:44.280 --> 11:46.647
Transpo reports. Get wiggling.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.730
Looks like I'm gonna miss that race.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.048
It's probably for the best.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.564
Yeah, uh, we just got the briefing.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.291
Yeah, not just, like, 10 minutes ago.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.806
- We got two agents...

12:19.640 --> 12:20.846
Jarvis residence.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.371
I don't have long,
so listen very carefully.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.010
I need you to dispose of Howard's car.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.011
I beg your pardon?

12:26.080 --> 12:28.208
The SSR are looking into Roxxon
at this very moment.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.169
That car sustained damage at the site

12:30.240 --> 12:32.402
and is likely to be teeming
with vita-radiation.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.521
Make it disappear.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.450
Very well.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.931
Let's see.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.365
The linens come out of the wash
in 30 minutes...

12:40.600 --> 12:41.681
Now.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.691
Fine. I shall forego the linens.

12:45.760 --> 12:46.921
Did you locate the dairy truck?

12:47.240 --> 12:48.969
Not yet, but I did locate the driver.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.411
Sheldon McFee uses the truck

12:50.480 --> 12:52.050
to commute from Cedar Grove,
New Jersey.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.646
Shall we leave straightaway?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.486
No.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.211
There's something I need
to take care of here first.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.446
You know, we used to be friends,
Howard and I.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.487
Lunch at the club,

13:06.560 --> 13:09.040
Christmas parties, charity functions.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.121
To your very good health, gentlemen.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.805
It's 10:45 in the morning.

13:15.880 --> 13:16.881
Ah.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.883
So, what came between you and Stark?

13:40.720 --> 13:41.926
My wife.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.480
Bit of a jump to go from that
to industrial sabotage.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.848
Not the way he does it, from what I hear.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.251
So it's personal, this attack?

13:48.320 --> 13:50.322
It's all the same with Howard,

13:50.400 --> 13:52.084
as long as he's amused
and making money.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.321
He attempted to purchase that refinery
as recently as January,

13:56.400 --> 13:57.811
but I refused.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.971
Now it's a smoking crater...

14:01.040 --> 14:02.883
Not to mention a federal crime scene.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.281
You tell me... Who benefits?

14:05.360 --> 14:08.364
Any idea what Stark may have used
to cause this kind of damage?

14:10.400 --> 14:14.530
What is your interest regarding
minor legal transgressions

14:14.600 --> 14:16.967
not related to the Red Hook Refinery?

14:17.640 --> 14:18.687
Low.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.683
We're not hunting you,
Mr. Jones.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.807
I have sources working
in Stark Industries,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.685
and they told me that
Howard is working on a formula

14:26.800 --> 14:29.087
for molecular Nitramene.

14:29.400 --> 14:33.405
Now, theoretically,
it could result in a concussive blast

14:33.480 --> 14:35.687
followed by a vacuum implosion.

14:36.520 --> 14:40.127
Supposedly, it has its roots
in his work with vita-radiation.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.687
All right, time out.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.484
Vita-radiation?

15:46.680 --> 15:48.011
Oh! Bloody hell.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.885
Hello?

16:02.560 --> 16:03.561
Sousa.

16:06.680 --> 16:07.681
Uh...

16:07.880 --> 16:09.564
No, I don't see her.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.291
Okay, okay.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.566
Well, I'll keep an eye out...

16:17.000 --> 16:19.128
Here she is. She's right,
she's right here.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.686
Chief wants a word.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.649
Chief Dooley? Just stepped away.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.127
Uh, vita-radiation?
Yes, I think we have something for that

16:37.200 --> 16:40.090
in the Project Rebirth file.
I'll see if I can find it.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.842
- What was that about?
- Oh, just another errand.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.970
- Carter. About time.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.011
Well. I didn't know our government had
such good taste in secretaries.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.320
What's your name, darling?

16:56.960 --> 16:58.121
"Agent."

16:58.440 --> 17:00.124
That has a lovely ring to it.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.444
As requested.
I'll meet you back at the office.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.761
What's the rush? Yeah, stick around.
We could use your help.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.760
It wouldn't be for filing, would it?

17:06.839 --> 17:08.762
Turns out,
anyone near the Nitramene blast

17:08.880 --> 17:10.405
was exposed to vita-radiation,

17:10.480 --> 17:13.006
which is probably still
some whereabouts on their person.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.367
So we're scanning everyone
on the Roxxon's staff.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.089
There's a chance this is an inside job.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.288
Yeah, there's a chance I take
Rita Hayworth home tonight,

17:19.359 --> 17:21.282
but it's unlikely, if you catch my drift.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.282
If you got some of Stark's guys
in your pocket,

17:23.359 --> 17:25.124
there's a chance he's got
some of your guys in his.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.361
And how am I to help?

17:26.800 --> 17:28.404
How comfortable are you with this?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.289
You'll be dealing with the ladies.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.890
I volunteered,

17:32.360 --> 17:34.488
but Chief said it wouldn't be appropriate.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.641
Oh.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.329
Sorry, Nana.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.725
You're clear.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.644
Clear. Thank you.

18:53.720 --> 18:54.801
Next.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.411
Carter?

19:02.400 --> 19:03.606
Ahhh!

19:06.560 --> 19:07.800
- Carter!

19:26.600 --> 19:28.045
You're clear.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.482
Wait. Uh, hold on a moment, sir.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.925
Excuse me. Sir?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.526
Mr. Jones, I notice these men
are wearing company-issued uniforms.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.090
Do they change their clothes onsite?

19:36.160 --> 19:37.446
Well, we have a locker room

19:37.520 --> 19:40.091
for all the technicians
who handle hazardous materials.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.207
What's your point, Carter?

19:41.280 --> 19:42.691
Well, low-level vita-radiation

19:42.760 --> 19:44.922
would barely saturate the top
layer of a person's skin.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.604
A hot shower
would wash it out straightaway.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.161
But clothing would
remain tainted for longer...

19:49.240 --> 19:50.810
Trousers, shoes, even a wristwatch.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.962
I suggest we check the clothes
the men wore to work this morning.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.084
Not a bad idea. We can...

19:55.200 --> 19:57.168
- Hey!
- Hey! Stop!

19:59.120 --> 20:00.360
Where does that lead?

20:00.440 --> 20:01.771
Down to the front lobby.

20:01.840 --> 20:02.921
Stairwell?

20:08.680 --> 20:09.841
May I?

20:11.360 --> 20:12.850
I said stop!

20:18.040 --> 20:19.610
Can I be of any further assistance?

20:35.560 --> 20:38.484
I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're in a bad spot.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.250
We have physical evidence linking you

20:42.320 --> 20:45.403
to an act of industrial sabotage
and probably treason.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.963
With the type of charges
being tossed around here,

20:48.040 --> 20:51.010
I can't see you winding up anywhere
besides the electric chair.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.971
Of course...

20:53.960 --> 20:57.760
You still do have the opportunity
to switch seats with someone else.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.241
You see, fighting crime

21:00.360 --> 21:02.124
is a lot like fishing with your buddies.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.850
Biggest fish wins.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.241
No offense,
but you're not the biggest fish.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.451
Doesn't mean
you're not plenty big enough

21:08.520 --> 21:10.284
for me to feed my bosses,

21:10.360 --> 21:12.408
but if you were to help me
catch a bigger fish...

21:12.480 --> 21:14.801
Say, a grouper or a shark...

21:15.440 --> 21:17.522
I could see myself
letting you off the line.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.451
I don't believe you.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.966
Well, you should.
I'm in law enforcement.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.002
Thing is, Mr. Van Ert,

21:27.480 --> 21:30.370
we're under a bit of
an accelerated time frame here.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.088
Lot of pressure to get this case sewn up.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.329
So this deal that I'm offering
you will expire...

21:37.280 --> 21:38.486
As soon as I leave the room.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.369
All you have to do

21:41.440 --> 21:43.841
is point us in the direction
of your employer.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.003
Just give me a name.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.689
Just give me a name.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.289
Don't say I didn't try
to do this the easy way.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.928
You can threaten me all you want,
but I'm not talking.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.527
I'm not here to make you talk, Miles.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.680
I'm here to make you sing.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.090
You're gonna want to bite down.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.681
Hate to see what would've happened
if you'd left the carrot.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.524
Carter, take off for the night.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.611
A lady shouldn't be seeing this.

22:49.720 --> 22:50.960
You boys play nice.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.086
<i>Talk.</i>

22:59.000 --> 23:00.047
Taxi!

23:00.120 --> 23:01.406
Oh, come on, Mr. Jarvis.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.482
A penguin could get here faster.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.721
- I found one!
- I'm late for my appointment!

23:07.800 --> 23:09.564
It has its own bathroom.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.802
I've no idea what you're saying.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.364
Don't make me come out there.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.561
- Angie, I really must...
- "Women only.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.086
"A safe community
for modern female professionals.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.323
"Apartment for rent.
550 square feet, furnished, full bath,

23:26.400 --> 23:28.402
"high floors, quiet building,
security assured.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.482
"Close proximity
to the Lexington Avenue Local.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.324
"Continental breakfast upon request."

23:32.400 --> 23:34.767
- Paradise or what?
- That sounds perfect.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.126
That's because it is.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.169
The only thing that could
possibly make it better

23:38.240 --> 23:39.366
is if you lived next to me.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.606
Oops! You would.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.762
3C if you need a cup of sugar.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.365
I really shouldn't, Angie.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.490
Am I missing something here?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.801
You need a place, this one is great, so...

23:48.880 --> 23:50.291
I'm thinking maybe it's me.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.202
I'm afraid I wouldn't make
a very good neighbor.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.731
Oh. That's my ride. I'll see you later.

24:03.480 --> 24:04.811
Too late!

24:12.720 --> 24:14.290
- Miss Carter.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.771
Mr. Jarvis.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.123
Meanwhile, in the snowy
mountains of the Eastern Alps,

24:22.200 --> 24:24.931
battalion triage nurse
Betty Carver tidies up

24:25.000 --> 24:26.809
while the men defend their country.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.891
What a beautiful day
to mend these pants.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.691
And my new Singer Featherweight
221 sewing machine

24:32.760 --> 24:34.683
makes stitching so easy.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.443
<i>Oh, no. Nazis! Again!</i>

24:39.520 --> 24:41.204
<i>They've got me all tied up!</i>

24:41.280 --> 24:44.443
<i>If only Captain America
were here to rescue me.</i>

24:44.520 --> 24:46.204
- Who writes this rubbish?

24:46.280 --> 24:48.408
I rather enjoy it, actually.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.768
Although, the... The real thing
is considerably more impressive.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.565
Are you trying to butter me up,
Mr. Jarvis?

24:53.640 --> 24:55.961
Merely pleased to receive your call.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.122
Well, you are faster than a train.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.685
How flattering.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.125
It's very nice.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.645
You did dispose of the old car?

25:02.720 --> 25:04.324
I left it in Hoboken
with the keys in the ignition.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.851
I don't imagine it's still there.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.524
It did seem a terrible waste, though.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.125
It was used
in the commission of a crime.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.004
One doesn't park
that sort of thing in a garage.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.164
Cedar Grove.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.486
Aptly named.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.164
You might hurry.
We don't have much time.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.402
I'm afraid Agent Thompson
can be rather persuasive.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.771
We're gonna need a new stick.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.848
Immigration has no record
of a "Leet Brannis"

25:25.960 --> 25:27.246
ever entering the country.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.560
Could be an alias.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.041
If it is,
our friend in there doesn't know it.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.360
He wasn't holding anything back.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.805
We get anything
on the milk-truck driver?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.370
I'm on hold with Daisy Clover payroll.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.647
He didn't sound like he was the brains
of the operation, anyway.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.768
More like the Krzeminski
of the operation.

25:39.840 --> 25:42.320
Joke's on you, peg leg.
I don't even know how to drive a truck.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.483
Driver may be a lead,
but this guy Brannis is the key.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.562
Sorry, Chief.
I pressed Van Ert pretty hard

25:47.640 --> 25:49.802
in there on Howard Stark.
I don't think he ever met him.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.086
Doesn't mean anything.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.401
Stark could have go-betweens
between his go-betweens.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.847
If this guy Brannis is
calling the shots on this deal,

25:55.920 --> 25:58.890
I'm telling you,
he's our direct link to Stark.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.405
I got the milk-truck driver.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.131
Sheldon McFee, 4 Springhill Road,
Cedar Grove, New Jersey.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.804
Hot damn. Let's go, boys.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.407
Down the road.
Pull up by the side.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.884
And here we are again.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.246
Fewer guards than Roxxon, at least.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.846
Shall I leave the engine running
in case you trigger another implosion?

27:00.920 --> 27:02.251
Mr. Jarvis, go home to your wife.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.322
If you leave now, you may even
catch the end of <i>Benny Goodman.</i>

27:04.400 --> 27:06.289
Miss Carter, when you called me,

27:06.360 --> 27:09.284
I assumed it was because
you needed more than a cab.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.283
I thought I proved rather useful last time.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.971
I agree, but on this occasion...

27:14.040 --> 27:16.088
I've got my own ride home.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.847
<i>We now return to</i>
The Captain America Adventure Program,

27:34.920 --> 27:36.604
<i>in which our hero's
defenseless sweetheart</i>

27:36.680 --> 27:39.081
<i>finds herself in the clutches of evil.</i>

27:40.040 --> 27:42.168
<i>American women are so weak!</i>

27:42.240 --> 27:44.004
<i>You are coming with us!</i>

27:44.080 --> 27:45.445
<i>If only Captain America</i>

27:45.520 --> 27:46.965
were here to rescue me.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.485
<i>Miss Carver isn't going</i>

27:49.560 --> 27:51.164
<i>anywhere with you, Nazi scum.</i>

27:51.240 --> 27:52.651
<i>Seize him!</i>

27:52.720 --> 27:54.245
<i>Unhand her!</i>

27:56.240 --> 27:58.208
- Hit him again, Cap!

27:59.840 --> 28:01.763
- Had enough yet?

28:09.400 --> 28:11.050
<i>Are you all right, Miss Carter?</i>

28:11.120 --> 28:12.645
Is that all you've got?

28:12.720 --> 28:14.210
Hello?

28:14.280 --> 28:15.361
Mr. McFee?

28:15.440 --> 28:16.885
<i>Captain America,</i>

28:16.960 --> 28:19.281
<i>what would I ever do without you?</i>

28:19.360 --> 28:20.964
Why does this keep happening?

28:21.440 --> 28:24.444
It's so hard getting straight answers
out of people nowadays.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.045
Whatever happened to a nice cup of tea

28:26.120 --> 28:27.690
and a civilized interrogation?

28:34.040 --> 28:35.280
Get out.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.125
Car trouble?

28:42.120 --> 28:43.770
Nothing that can't be fixed.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.724
What the hell are you doing here?

28:45.800 --> 28:48.644
Mr. Stark asked me to help you,
and so I have.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.087
- I sabotaged the motor.
- Move, and I shoot.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.650
I thought you'd be more impressed.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.722
Well, I'm not.
I told you I don't need your help.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.041
An ideal butler provides service
without being asked.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.361
Put it back.
I need to drive this thing out of here.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.010
Won't be a moment.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.004
Where are Stark's inventions?

29:12.000 --> 29:12.967
<i>I want protection.</i>

29:13.040 --> 29:14.929
The SSR will take you in,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.924
provided that you say something
interesting right bloody now.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.166
Psst!

29:20.800 --> 29:22.131
Ask him about Leviathan.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.364
Who is Leviathan?

29:25.440 --> 29:26.805
<i>Not who. What.</i>

29:27.200 --> 29:29.441
- Your employers?
<i>- Not anymore.</i>

29:29.520 --> 29:32.285
So Leviathan sent you
to rob Howard Stark's vault?

29:32.880 --> 29:34.882
And you double-crossed them?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.162
Well, that seems incredibly
brave or incredibly stupid.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.530
<i>Leviathan only wanted one thing
from Howard Stark.</i>

29:43.760 --> 29:44.966
All finished.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.122
Well, fetch Mr. McFee.
I need to take him in, too.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.527
What was the one thing?
What was Leviathan after?

29:51.360 --> 29:54.045
<i>I want protection.</i>

29:54.360 --> 29:55.885
Then start talking.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.645
Uh, bit of a snag, actually.

30:01.720 --> 30:04.087
I'm afraid Mr. McFee's left the premises.

30:04.560 --> 30:05.766
I did find this.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.446
Mmm. Don't shoot yourself in the face.
Get in the truck.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.324
Comfortable back there,
Mr. Jarvis?

30:15.400 --> 30:17.004
Perfectly, thank you.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.445
These racks of explosives

30:18.520 --> 30:20.010
have distracted me
from the smell of stale milk.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.321
Oh, good.
You did say you wanted to help.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.449
Take the Lincoln Tunnel
back to Manhattan.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.488
And stop fidgeting.
Nothing's going to happen.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.006
Did either of you hear that?

30:34.920 --> 30:36.046
Well, I definitely heard that!

30:40.880 --> 30:42.211
Shake him loose!

30:47.360 --> 30:48.600
Shoot up!

30:55.120 --> 30:56.281
Chief.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.250
Well, that's suspicious.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.121
Evenin'.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.480
Pull over!

31:31.560 --> 31:33.289
If you do not pull over this instant,

31:33.360 --> 31:36.091
I will have no choice but to shoot you!

31:39.800 --> 31:42.167
For God's sake, will you please
stop shooting things?

31:58.360 --> 32:00.488
Do I even need to ask?

32:00.560 --> 32:01.846
Ask what?

32:03.560 --> 32:05.244
Yeah, I guess you're right.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.724
I used to strap a chair to my ass

32:07.800 --> 32:10.007
and take long walks
around the neighborhood, too.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.408
We know who you are, Mr. McFee.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.925
We were on our way to pay you a visit.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.968
So, who did this to you?

32:17.080 --> 32:18.844
Was it Leet Brannis?

32:19.360 --> 32:21.761
We know he paid you off
to use the truck.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.610
You're in deep water.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.887
I'd take that life preserver, if I was you.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.483
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.008
We'll keep an open mind.

32:35.560 --> 32:37.085
- Miss Carter!

32:37.160 --> 32:38.491
I hear it!

32:40.880 --> 32:42.803
Get Brannis! Jump clear!

32:42.880 --> 32:43.881
What?

32:56.360 --> 32:57.805
This is where I get off.

32:59.720 --> 33:00.721
Going to roll...

33:23.840 --> 33:24.966
What the hell is that?

33:25.040 --> 33:27.247
Thompson, step on it.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.840
Are you all right?

33:42.920 --> 33:44.843
I'm fine. You?

33:44.960 --> 33:46.200
Yes, I...

33:47.280 --> 33:49.601
I'm afraid Mr. Brannis broke my fall.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.329
The rest of the weapons
that you stole from Howard...

33:57.440 --> 33:59.647
I need to find out where you hid them.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.049
You're the only one who knows.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.009
I need to find those weapons before...

34:09.040 --> 34:10.485
Leviathan is coming.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.851
Help me stop them.

34:26.520 --> 34:28.045
What is that?

34:28.120 --> 34:29.610
Mr. Brannis, what is that? A heart?

34:37.840 --> 34:39.763
Mr. Brannis...

34:43.320 --> 34:44.606
Where is the car?

34:47.280 --> 34:48.690
It's that way.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.524
I think we should retrieve it immediately.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.364
Miss Carter, please.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.605
Allow me.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.930
I used to come skinny-dipping
here as a kid.

35:17.760 --> 35:18.921
That's a sight.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.003
Somebody knows what we know
before we know it,

35:22.080 --> 35:23.684
and it's really starting to chap my ass.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.444
We can pick up
some baby powder for you

35:25.560 --> 35:27.050
on the way back. Maybe that'll help.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.202
We got footprints. A woman's.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.366
She was with him till he died.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.004
Or up until she popped him herself.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.048
Got to be the broad who cuffed fatty
to his chair.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.321
Could be that blonde at the nightclub.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.367
We ever get a look at her?

35:38.440 --> 35:40.329
Pictures were Sousa's detail.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.845
What the hell is he doing?

35:41.920 --> 35:44.241
Sousa! What the hell are you doing?

35:58.480 --> 35:59.766
You're quite good at that.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.770
Yes, Mr. Stark's zippers
are under considerable strain.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.571
You're very fortunate, you know?

36:07.640 --> 36:08.687
He missed the bone by 3 inches.

36:08.760 --> 36:09.921
That's not what I meant.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.411
Then look me in the eye
and say what you meant.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.762
You're very fortunate that
I ignored your instructions.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.330
Oh, you're so right.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.801
How I managed to stay alive
before I met you, I have no idea.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.690
I can't tell if you're being
arrogant or ignorant.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.323
Both, I imagine.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.001
Your line of work requires support.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.650
People who care about your well-being,

36:31.720 --> 36:33.324
who'll be there to stitch up your wounds.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.200
If I allow people to get close to me,
I'm putting them in danger.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.727
So your solution is to remove yourself
from the world you wish to protect?

36:39.840 --> 36:41.285
Where's the sense in that?

36:48.080 --> 36:49.969
There is not a man or woman,

36:50.040 --> 36:52.042
no matter how fit he or she may be,
who is capable

36:52.120 --> 36:54.487
of carrying the entire world
on their shoulders.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.883
Steve was.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.564
From what Mr. Stark has told me,

36:59.640 --> 37:02.530
Captain Rogers relied heavily on you...

37:03.320 --> 37:05.800
For courage, strategy,
and moral guidance.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.642
You were his support.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.291
Your desire to help others is noble.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.769
But I doubt you'll find much success
unless you allow others to help you.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.646
As you were.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.090
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.685
That's Mary. She's a legal secretary

37:38.760 --> 37:40.603
at Goodman, Kurtzberg, and Holliway.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.091
- Evelyn.
- Hey, Angie.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.367
Evelyn is a lounge singer
at a club in Midtown.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.408
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.445
That's Sarah. She's a slut.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.649
I am so happy you changed your mind.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.131
You're gonna love living here.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.247
Assuming I'm accepted.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.561
I've never rented a flat
that required an interview.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.450
It's just a formality. You'll ace it.
Miriam's a total pussycat.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.128
Your references are impeccable.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.441
Senator Palmer
is especially complimentary.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.124
He and my father were dear friends.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.963
Were you limping as you came in?

38:15.040 --> 38:16.565
Caught my heel on a cobblestone.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.244
You know how the West Village is.

38:19.040 --> 38:22.328
I never travel below 23rd Street,
so no, I do not.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.567
How long do you see yourself
working for the telephone company?

38:31.960 --> 38:33.610
Only until I'm married, Miss Fry.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.801
In a city filled with temptation,
debauchery, and mischief,

38:39.920 --> 38:43.641
The Griffith Hotel is a haven
for proper young ladies.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.124
Our code of conduct is indisputable.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.521
Attire should be demure and elegant.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.922
Curfew is 10:00. No drinking.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.606
No men above the first floor.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.449
No exceptions.

38:58.520 --> 38:59.885
Is that clear, Miss Carter?

38:59.960 --> 39:01.291
Perfectly.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.482
That is it.
Show him, Sousa. Right there.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.681
Yeah, we're right. Show that other photo.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.125
- Not even close.
- No.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.645
That right there.
That's the angle.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.449
Don't back off, okay? I'm telling you.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.088
Carter, come here for a second.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.124
- Come here, come here, come here.

39:25.320 --> 39:27.129
Settle a bet for us.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.365
Is that Joe DiMaggio?

39:34.600 --> 39:35.806
I don't follow boxing.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.525
- Aw!

39:38.000 --> 39:40.128
I told you she wouldn't
know who DiMaggio was.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.531
I still say it's him.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.931
Believe me,
I think I'd know

39:43.000 --> 39:44.047
if I was in the same room
as Joe DiMaggio.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.201
How do you figure?

39:45.320 --> 39:46.970
I would sense his presence.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.804
Ah, get outta here.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.571
You bet against me?
How could you be sure?

39:52.920 --> 39:55.161
I wasn't.
That's why they call it gambling.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.609
Did you, um, spot anyone else?

39:59.080 --> 40:02.402
Nothing definitive,
but we got a couple shots of the blonde.

40:02.480 --> 40:03.925
She really knows how to duck a camera.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.923
Not one clear shot of her face.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.811
Tough break.

40:08.760 --> 40:11.081
Nobody's lucky forever. I'll find her.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.407
Mmm.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.847
Once again, the powers of
freedom and democracy prevail.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.843
I'm so lucky to have a man

40:19.920 --> 40:22.651
as brave and strong as Captain America.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.241
<i>Not so fast, Captain America.</i>

40:25.360 --> 40:27.840
<i>I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.</i>

40:27.960 --> 40:30.770
<i>You'll never be able
to defeat my secret weapon.</i>

40:30.840 --> 40:32.808
<i>What on earth could that be?</i>

40:32.880 --> 40:35.121
<i>And that concludes
tonight's episode of</i>

40:35.200 --> 40:37.407
The Captain America
Adventure Program!

40:37.480 --> 40:40.563
<i>Be sure to tune in next week
for another thrilling tale...</i>

40:40.640 --> 40:43.211
You find something, Krzeminski?

40:43.280 --> 40:46.363
Yeah. Think I found something big.
