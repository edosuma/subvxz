00:16.517 --> 00:21.522
[chains rattling]
[Kelly panting]

00:28.796 --> 00:30.431
- Hey guys, it's Kelly.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.133
Hey guys, it's Kelly.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.801
Hey guys, it's Kelly.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.503
Hey guys, it's Kelly.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.138
Hey guys, it's Kelly.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.806
Hey guys, it's Kelly.

00:38.806 --> 00:43.777
[chattering continues]
[tense music continues]

00:47.581 --> 00:48.549
Help!

00:48.549 --> 00:50.384
Someone get me out of here!

00:50.384 --> 00:51.185
Help!

00:53.121 --> 00:55.022
Stop!

00:55.956 --> 00:57.325
Stop, stop!

01:00.394 --> 01:01.895
Help!

01:01.895 --> 01:02.730
Help!

01:05.366 --> 01:06.934
Someone get me out of here!

01:06.934 --> 01:08.536
Help! Help!

01:08.536 --> 01:10.003
Stop!

01:21.482 --> 01:22.483
- You must be Kelly.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.486
- No, no.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.320
Help!

01:27.488 --> 01:30.624
Help, someone get me out
of here, please help.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.026
- You must be Kelly.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.398
- What do you want?

01:37.398 --> 01:40.801
[Charles laughs]
- You must be Kelly.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.303
You must be Kelly.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.206
- What do you want, you freak?

01:45.206 --> 01:48.309
- You must be Kelly.
You must be Kelly.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.711
- Listen to me, you
fucking asshole-

01:53.447 --> 01:56.417
- You must be Kelly!

01:56.417 --> 01:58.586
- You must-
- Yes, yes!

01:58.586 --> 01:59.387
Yes.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.323
Yeah.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.957
I'm Kelly.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.792
- Kelly.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.796
Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure to
meet you, I'm Charles.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.601
- Pleased to meet
you too, Charles.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.004
Pleased to meet you too.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.373
- Do you know what that was?

02:19.373 --> 02:21.275
- No, I don't.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.876
- We were being
polite to each other.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.214
It's a courtesy, Kelly.

02:26.214 --> 02:29.483
We made one positive
presumptive notion

02:29.483 --> 02:31.819
that it was nice to meet
each other even when we don't

02:31.819 --> 02:33.287
know each other.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.689
Do you know what
somebody my age has to do

02:35.689 --> 02:37.291
to get some undivided
attention from you?

02:37.291 --> 02:39.827
I got to tie you up.
I got to kidnap you.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.531
That's how I make you focus.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.465
- What do you want?

02:47.235 --> 02:49.837
- I want to release
you from this prison.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.008
- I politely request you to
tell me what it is you want

02:55.008 --> 02:55.809
from me.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.548
- All right, I'll
cut to the chase;

03:00.548 --> 03:01.949
you're an influencer, right?

03:03.951 --> 03:05.319
- Yeah, I guess.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.087
- You guess?

03:07.087 --> 03:08.722
You guess?

03:08.722 --> 03:13.126
You have 467,493,
followers right now.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.262
You're an influencer or not?

03:14.262 --> 03:15.363
- Yeah, yeah.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.196
- Yeah.

03:17.598 --> 03:20.033
And I would like you to think
of me as a de-influencer.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.271
- That's why you're
wearing a mask?

03:23.271 --> 03:24.705
- That's for your protection.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.007
- That ugly, huh?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.910
- Start listening!

03:29.910 --> 03:32.413
Start listening like your
life depends on it, Kelly,

03:32.413 --> 03:33.581
cause it does!

03:34.815 --> 03:37.685
- You're going to
kill me anyways.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.952
- Am I?

03:38.952 --> 03:39.920
- Yeah.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.854
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.089
- And how do you know that?

03:42.089 --> 03:43.391
- Because no one
would go that far

03:43.391 --> 03:45.993
just to release them after.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.529
- Oh, I didn't say you wouldn't
have to earn your freedom,

03:48.529 --> 03:50.564
Kelly, you do.

03:50.564 --> 03:54.435
But your freedom is possible.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.537
Unharmed, I promise.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.471
- How?

03:58.539 --> 03:59.907
- Well, just be yourself.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.175
- I am myself.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.478
- No, the real you. This you.

04:05.779 --> 04:06.747
- What?

04:08.316 --> 04:09.149
- Who's that?

04:12.386 --> 04:13.954
- It's me.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.657
- Don't be stupid,
Kelly, who's that?

04:16.657 --> 04:17.725
Who is it?

04:17.725 --> 04:18.559
- It's me.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.795
- No, but it's it's
not, is it? Look at it.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.764
It's a more airbrushed,

04:24.898 --> 04:27.568
filtered, like romantic
soft version of you.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.036
It's not the real you.

04:30.438 --> 04:33.341
You that manipulates
little girls

04:33.341 --> 04:35.576
into thinking that they
need to look this beautiful

04:35.576 --> 04:38.145
on the outside with
nothing on the inside.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.282
I wish those little
girls could see you now.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.353
Not so soft. Look at that
hard look in your eyes.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.488
Looking at that weapon on the
floor, wondering if you could

04:47.488 --> 04:50.057
get to that pipe, maybe
beat me to death with it.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.893
Maybe escape out of here.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.397
You think those lies,
about how soft you are,

04:56.397 --> 04:58.432
are better than the
cold hard truth?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.033
They're not.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.101
It's not soft.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.838
So why do you project that lie

05:04.838 --> 05:07.207
when the truth is
much more interesting?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.448
- Pretty please with a
fucking cherry on top.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.484
What the fuck do you want?

05:18.085 --> 05:20.654
- Kelly, I just want to
collaborate with you.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.025
[dramatic music]

05:25.025 --> 05:28.195
[driving tense music]

06:43.704 --> 06:46.540

06:56.784 --> 06:57.951
[light clicks]

06:58.819 --> 07:02.422
[buzzer beeping]

07:09.797 --> 07:11.364
[Kelly banging]
- Help!

07:11.364 --> 07:13.567
Please, I'm in here!

07:13.567 --> 07:14.902
[door banging]

07:14.902 --> 07:15.736
Fuck!

07:18.105 --> 07:19.740
Help!

07:19.740 --> 07:20.574
Shit.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.678
[tense music]

07:35.823 --> 07:37.357
Please!

07:37.357 --> 07:38.191
Please!

07:39.593 --> 07:40.427
Shit.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.654
- Do not attempt
to escape, Kelly;

08:06.654 --> 08:09.890
if you do expect nothing less
than a bullet in your head.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.293
[pipe clatters]

08:16.463 --> 08:18.966
[eerie music]

08:33.413 --> 08:35.015
[camera clicks]

08:39.587 --> 08:40.754
[camera clicks]

09:03.243 --> 09:05.913
You're wasting
precious time, Kelly.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.660
- Take the fucking picture.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.996
- No, Kelly. We're not
looking for a proof of life.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.065
This isn't some ransom request.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.266
- What?

09:26.266 --> 09:27.868
- Take one of your
normal photos.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.569
Something worth 1,000 likes.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.304
Come on, play the game.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.472
- No.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.774
No, no.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.344
I've just been kidnapped,
I'm not going to post just

09:37.344 --> 09:38.846
a casual selfie.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.848
- What are you so worried about?

09:40.848 --> 09:43.316
The number of followers you
have has jumped by thousands.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.952
It's going to make
taking this kind of photo

09:44.952 --> 09:46.286
easier and easier.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.321
- You're messing
with people's mind.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.591
Acting all normal.
Who does that?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.961
- Messing with people's
minds, isn't that what you do

09:53.961 --> 09:55.863
on social media all day long?

09:58.866 --> 10:00.267
- This is messed up.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.270
- Play the game. Something
worth 1,000 likes.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.805
- You know what?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.073
Fuck this shit.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.845
- This is disappointing.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.782
Now I'm going to have
to escalate things.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.352
[gas hissing]

10:19.352 --> 10:22.522
- No!
[Kelly coughing]

10:34.367 --> 10:36.837
Hey, what the fuck did you do?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.440
Answer me, what did you do?

10:43.143 --> 10:46.880
- A lesson. I
taught you a lesson.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.515
- What?

10:48.515 --> 10:50.984
- I need you to
engage with your task.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.586
- My task?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.824
- 1,000 likes in an hour.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.794
Christ, Kelly, you have
half a million followers,

11:00.794 --> 11:03.563
have you any idea how easy
a thousand likes from that

11:03.563 --> 11:04.698
would be?

11:04.698 --> 11:06.133
But what did you do?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.268
Hey, what did you do?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.102
Nothing.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.874
- So what?

11:13.874 --> 11:15.375
- So I took a toe.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.311
- You did what?

11:18.311 --> 11:20.781
- You can live a perfectly
normal life with nine toes.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.582
I'm sure lots of people do it.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.184
- What did you do
that? What do you need?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.019
Do you need followers?
What do you need?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.723
- Not followers;
listen, Kelly, likes.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.659
I need likes from your account.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.828
This is your audience.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.430
I need you to show me

11:37.430 --> 11:39.666
that you can get a
message out there

11:39.666 --> 11:41.735
and they will react to it.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.772
- Look, I get it, as you may
be all new to this, granddad,

11:44.772 --> 11:47.540
but I shouldn't be
judged on how many likes,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.777
I should be judged on
how many followers I get.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.578
This is what you
need from me, right?

11:52.780 --> 11:54.848
- Not followers, you're
not listening, Kelly.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.950
Likes. And I don't need
them, you need them.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.285
These are likes
from your account.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.887
We're going to post
from your account.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.489
This is your audience, you
should be cherishing them.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.125
They're the most important
thing in the world to you.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.396
- I don't give a
shit about followers.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.935
My followers are the
most important thing

12:14.935 --> 12:16.203
in the world to me.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.806
My followers are the
most important thing

12:18.806 --> 12:19.807
in the world to me.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.709
All right, stop!

12:24.477 --> 12:25.578
Jesus Christ.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.948
- Do you understand me now?

12:27.948 --> 12:30.117
- I understand that you're
fucking sick in the head

12:30.117 --> 12:33.053
and now you're got to
fucking kill me, so fuck off!

12:33.053 --> 12:34.587
- Easy, easy.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.823
You're straining yourself.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.425
You're going to rip the
stitches in your foot.

12:39.659 --> 12:42.029
- Good. Then hopefully
I'll bleed out.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.766
- You can't escape this.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.836
- You're a liar.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.938
- I will never lie to you. Ever.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.307
- You're going to kill me.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.110
What you're doing right now
is just you playing with your

12:57.110 --> 13:00.047
food, having fun, that's
what you're doing.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.548
- That's not true.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.583
- How's that?

13:03.583 --> 13:05.218
- Because I'm still
wearing my mask.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.521
- That's just cause
you're fucking ugly.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.126
[Kelly whimpers]

13:13.126 --> 13:15.528
- Stop, okay?

13:15.528 --> 13:16.363
Stop.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.067
Stop, Kelly.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.370
Your little bitchy words,
they have real life

13:23.370 --> 13:25.105
consequences here.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.374
You're not bitching at some
little teen behind the safety

13:27.374 --> 13:28.808
of a keyboard.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.677
No, here your words
mean something.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.179
Here, my words mean something.

13:32.179 --> 13:35.315
And today what I'm telling you
is I'm keeping this mask on

13:35.315 --> 13:37.484
because I believe you
can get out of here.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.619
And the reason I'm doing
it is because you won't

13:39.619 --> 13:40.687
ID me later.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.323
- ID you?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.027
- To the authorities for
Christ's sake, Kelly.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.129
Aren't you going to make a
9-1-1 call and talk about

13:49.129 --> 13:50.630
the man that held you captive?

13:50.630 --> 13:53.266
And when you do that, I
need to give you as little

13:53.266 --> 13:55.435
information as possible.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.538
You already know my voice.
You already know my name.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.740
- Look, I promise that
if you let me out,

14:00.740 --> 14:01.774
I won't say anything.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.545
- I'm afraid that time
has been and gone.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.816
In order to gain your freedom
now you need to do the tasks

14:09.816 --> 14:11.018
I set you.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.320
If you hit the goal,
I'll let you go.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.554
It's that simple.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.090
- So what?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.591
You're just going to keep
playing with me till you

14:18.591 --> 14:20.760
get enough likes, is that
what you're going to do?

14:22.162 --> 14:24.731
- These are your likes. We're
posting from your account.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.467
It's your followers,
therefore, you.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.568
- No!
- Yes.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.237
Yes you will.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.007
And if you don't, Kelly,

14:34.007 --> 14:36.176
I will take you piece at a time

14:37.210 --> 14:39.046
until there's nothing left.

14:39.046 --> 14:39.879
- Oh yeah?

14:40.948 --> 14:41.915
Then do so.

14:43.383 --> 14:47.087
I'm not begging for my life,
I have more pride than that.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.022
- I can see that.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.058
Kelly isn't going
to beg for her life.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.828
Maybe you'll beg
for someone else's.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.764
Maybe you'll beg for hers.

14:57.764 --> 14:58.698
- What?

14:58.698 --> 14:59.666
- You'll see.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.101
- Wait, no.

15:01.101 --> 15:01.935
No.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.470
Come back here!

15:03.470 --> 15:04.304
Hey!

15:23.991 --> 15:24.824
Oh my god.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.629
- Don't! Hey!
- Hey!

15:29.629 --> 15:31.598
It's okay, it's
okay, I'm not him.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.066
- I was running,
there was a van.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.534
- I'm not the guy that
took you, he took me too.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.303
- Who?
- I don't know.

15:39.739 --> 15:40.673
- Where are we?

15:42.742 --> 15:44.544
- I'm not sure. I don't know.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.513
- Who are you?
- I'm Kelly.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.547
- Weaver?

15:48.615 --> 15:50.083
- Yeah. How do you know?

15:50.083 --> 15:53.353
- Your picture, it's all over
the news, you're missing.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.854
- Okay, see? They're
looking for us.

15:54.854 --> 15:55.855
We're going to be okay.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.390
- What does he want?

15:57.390 --> 15:58.225
- I'm not sure.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.096
Do you remember anything?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.132
How did you get there? How
far you traveled? Anything?

16:05.132 --> 16:07.467
- Nothing, just this voice.

16:10.903 --> 16:11.804
- What did he say?

16:14.407 --> 16:17.510
- That I was here to help you
get you out of your prison.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.915
What does that mean?

16:26.886 --> 16:29.089
- Wait, wait, it's
going to be okay.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.291
- What happened?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.726
- Nothing, nothing.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.595
- Did he do that?
- No.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.696
- Why lie, Kelly?

16:38.298 --> 16:39.699
- Is that him?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.234
- Yeah.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.436
- Why lie about what?

16:43.436 --> 16:45.838
- That bandage you see, Sabrina,

16:45.838 --> 16:49.142
I took a toe because she
didn't do as I asked.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.710
She's lucky that's all I took.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.680
Who knows what I'm
going to take next?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.182
Maybe a finger.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.317
Might be something
more important to her.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.352
Something on that
pretty face of hers.

17:00.787 --> 17:05.225
An ear, an eye, my, I have
so much to choose from.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.260
I really do have my
work cut out for me.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.165
- Oh my god, oh my god.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.633
We're going to die.
- No.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.901
- We're those girls.
- No, no!

17:14.901 --> 17:16.436
- He's going to
rape and kill us.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.338
- We're not going to die, no
one is getting raped, okay?

17:18.338 --> 17:21.208
- I want to go home.
He's going to kill us.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.275
I can't die.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.145
- My favorite
girls in the world!

17:25.145 --> 17:27.747
Oh my god, I want
to live forever!

17:27.747 --> 17:29.082
What is that?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.517
- [Charles] Well,
that's you, Sabrina.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.018
- Make it stop!

17:32.018 --> 17:33.853
- Telling everybody that
you want to live forever.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.088
- Why is he doing this?

17:35.088 --> 17:36.889
- He's trying to
get into your head.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.158
- Well, it's working.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.260
- All right, all right.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.062
I'll do what you want.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.798
[buzzer beeping]

18:02.182 --> 18:03.783
[camera clicking]

18:07.887 --> 18:10.390
- Kelly. Kelly, there's a phone.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.833
- Caption for the photo.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.001
- What?

18:22.001 --> 18:23.636
- [Charles] Caption
for the photo.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.410
- I'm lonely. Anyone
wants to talk to me?

18:30.410 --> 18:32.078
- Is there anything else?

18:32.078 --> 18:33.180
- Post it.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.281
- [Charles] It's live.

18:35.682 --> 18:36.516
- What now?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.051
- We wait.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.387
- For what?

18:40.387 --> 18:42.054
- For people to like it.

18:46.526 --> 18:51.531
[timer beeping]
[melancholy piano music]

18:57.069 --> 18:58.671
I can't watch this.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.274
- You're a cheerleader,
aren't you?

19:02.342 --> 19:03.543
- Yeah.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.444
For the Devils.

19:06.078 --> 19:06.913
- That's cool.

19:08.715 --> 19:09.549
- I guess.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.187
What about you?

19:15.755 --> 19:16.823
- No.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.691
Not slutty enough.

19:18.691 --> 19:22.395
I dunno know, something
about it feels wrong.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.096
I mean, it's only
for boys, right?

19:25.632 --> 19:26.833
Well, I guess you
wouldn't think that,

19:26.833 --> 19:28.568
otherwise you
wouldn't be doing it.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.439
Sorry. Don't know
why I said that.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.841
- No. It's fine.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.008
You're right, honestly.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.211
- Then why do it?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.381
- My boyfriend is
the quarterback.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.285
- So you really are that girl.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.085
- Yep.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.154
Very popular.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.857
For all the good it does to me.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.061
- What happens if it
doesn't hit 1,000?

19:56.796 --> 19:58.365
- I don't know.

19:58.365 --> 20:03.370
[timer beeping]
[tense music]

20:27.394 --> 20:29.696
[descending ringing]

20:31.197 --> 20:33.065
- [Charles] And
you're out of time.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.066
Show's over.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.003
- What's happening?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.838
- No, no, no, no, no! Please!

20:38.838 --> 20:40.473
No, no, no, please, please.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.942
I swear to god, I tried my
best, just needed more time.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.143
Please, please!

20:44.143 --> 20:46.946
[Kelly screaming]

21:14.273 --> 21:15.508
- Are you okay?

21:21.648 --> 21:23.583
Sabrina, what happened?

21:26.152 --> 21:27.720
- He made me watch.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.758
- Made you watch what?

21:33.860 --> 21:36.929
- I'm sorry, I tried to
get you, I couldn't move.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.799
- Sabrina, what are
you talking about?

21:41.434 --> 21:42.902
Sabrina, what happened?

21:42.902 --> 21:43.903
- I'm so sorry.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.040
I did everything I could.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.914
- I took one of your kidneys.

21:59.752 --> 22:00.753
- You did what?

22:01.988 --> 22:03.390
- This was difficult for me.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.027
You didn't hit the target,
but god, you tried.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.295
And it was a valiant effort.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.598
I mean, look at this picture.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.033
999 likes.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.603
If I was on social media, I
would've liked this picture.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.673
But I'm not, so you missed it.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.544
And the target is a target.

22:24.544 --> 22:27.213
And missing it
has a cost, Kelly.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.484
- You took my fucking kidney.

22:33.853 --> 22:34.687
- Just the one.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.323
You still have the other one.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.025
- I'm sorry.

22:39.025 --> 22:39.859
- Hey, don't be.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.161
This wasn't your fight.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.464
But the next one might be.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.668
Do you know what
this reminds me of?

22:48.668 --> 22:49.469
Theseus.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.138
Any of you ladies
heard the story?

22:53.239 --> 22:55.241
- No idea what
you're talking about.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.309
- In ancient Greece, there
was a man called Theseus

22:57.309 --> 22:58.911
who had a ship,

22:58.911 --> 23:02.281
and over a course of time
his ship would need repairs;

23:02.281 --> 23:04.484
the wood would rot, so
we'd have to replace it

23:04.484 --> 23:05.652
plank by plank.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.155
So eventually, seven years
later, the entire ship

23:09.155 --> 23:10.256
had been replaced.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.894
- Okay, so?

23:14.894 --> 23:17.129
- Well, so if the entire
ship has been replaced

23:17.129 --> 23:20.399
from its original raw materials,
is it still the same ship?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.136
- Yeah, I guess.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.173
- I agree with you.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.407
But not everybody does.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.343
Interesting though, isn't it?

23:33.746 --> 23:35.615
- Does this have a point?

23:35.615 --> 23:37.216
- Kelly, I'm glad you asked.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.851
There is.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.787
Because what's happening
to you here and now

23:40.787 --> 23:42.522
is changing you.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.757
You lose a toe, it changes you.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.559
You lose a kidney,
it changes you.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.028
Forever.

23:49.028 --> 23:52.465
But maybe it's a piece of
you that needed replacing.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.366
Maybe you needed to
change in order to grow,

23:54.366 --> 23:56.769
in order to see the
world a different way.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.439
Maybe you're not the same
person you were a week ago.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.245
And maybe that's a good thing.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.915
[alarm beeping]

24:10.817 --> 24:12.619
I'll leave you
with that thought.

24:14.787 --> 24:15.955
And good luck.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.591
You're going to need it.

24:25.131 --> 24:25.965
- Kelly.

24:29.401 --> 24:30.670
- Let me think.

24:36.142 --> 24:36.976
- Don't.

24:38.511 --> 24:41.080
Don't. I'm a med student.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.416
I saw what he did to you,
there was a lot of blood.

24:44.416 --> 24:46.285
If you put pressure on
it, it should clot it,

24:46.285 --> 24:48.588
but you cannot
remove that bandage.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.421
- Okay.

24:50.389 --> 24:51.223
Okay.

24:54.994 --> 24:55.828
- 5,000.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.197
That's too many.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.432
- No, no, I can do it.

25:00.432 --> 25:01.701
- How?

25:01.701 --> 25:02.535
- Sex.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.337
Sex sells.

[camera clicks]

25:33.833 --> 25:34.801
Fuck.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.468
I can do better than that.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.906
- [Charles] Are
you ready to post?

25:39.906 --> 25:41.808
- No, take another one.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.723
Take the fucking picture.

[water pouring]

26:04.697 --> 26:06.398
[camera clicks]

26:10.837 --> 26:13.572
- Okay, I need to
say something sexy.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.608
- [Charles] Are
you ready to post?

26:15.608 --> 26:17.209
- Yeah, hold on.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.711
- [Charles] What is the caption?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.381
- I love the rain.

26:22.381 --> 26:23.616
- No.

26:23.616 --> 26:24.450
No, that's not.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.721
Nothing better in this world
than a hot, wet cheerleader.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.889
- That's good.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.123
- Boys are stupid, right?

26:33.893 --> 26:35.194
- You heard her.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.528
Post it.

26:36.528 --> 26:39.565
- I'm afraid I didn't
hear what Sabrina said.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.100
What was the caption?

26:41.100 --> 26:44.370
- Nothing better in this world
than a hot, wet cheerleader.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.539
- [Charles] It's live.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.576
- Boys are stupid.

26:50.576 --> 26:51.811
It'll work.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.212
- Yeah, but will it
work in two hours?

26:56.315 --> 26:58.084
Is that what I think it is?

26:58.084 --> 26:59.719
- A watch?

26:59.719 --> 27:01.453
- A smart watch?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.656
- Yeah, there's not
exactly wifi in here.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.391
- Okay, but he has our phone.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.592
I saw it.

27:06.592 --> 27:07.860
He has mine.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.361
- Okay, and?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.297
- Well, so when he comes in,
the Bluetooth can turn in

27:11.297 --> 27:13.766
and the messages that have
been pending can send out.

27:13.766 --> 27:14.801
We can get the word out.

27:14.801 --> 27:15.735
- And say what?

27:15.735 --> 27:17.203
- That we've been kidnapped.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.304
- Well, they probably
already know we're missing

27:18.304 --> 27:20.306
and we don't know where we are.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.841
- It's worth a try.

27:21.841 --> 27:22.675
- Okay.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.245
- Be careful, he's watching.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.749
- I figure he's always watching.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.017
- No.

27:31.017 --> 27:31.951
No.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.485
I haven't seen anyone else.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.687
- So?

27:34.687 --> 27:36.622
- And he has to sleep sometimes.

27:36.622 --> 27:37.824
- What should I tell them?

27:37.824 --> 27:39.859
- That we're alive, but
trapped in something

27:39.859 --> 27:42.394
that looked like an
abandoned boiler room,

27:42.394 --> 27:45.231
and there's one guy
with an English accent.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.900
That's all we know.
- Okay.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.902
I'll send a voice message
to one of my friends.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.237
- Why not the police?

27:51.237 --> 27:54.040
- Well, you can't
exactly text 9-1-1 and

27:54.040 --> 27:56.242
we don't even know where we are.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.510
- Okay, but they can
locate our phones.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.412
- Yeah, but what
if he finds out?

28:00.412 --> 28:01.781
He'll move us

28:01.781 --> 28:03.249
or worse.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.283
- Yeah, you're right.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.389
- Do you have something to
share with the class, ladies?

28:11.858 --> 28:14.260
There's a lot of
whispering down there.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.828
- Yeah.

28:15.828 --> 28:16.996
We need tampons.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.298
You hear me?

28:21.333 --> 28:22.935
- [Charles] It will be arranged.

28:24.070 --> 28:24.904
- Tampons?

28:26.338 --> 28:28.540
- You ever see a guy who wants
to know more about periods?

28:29.842 --> 28:30.743
- Boys are stupid.

28:31.610 --> 28:32.678
- Boys are stupid.

28:33.780 --> 28:38.785
[timer ticking]
[tense music]

28:49.028 --> 28:52.064
[bright jingling]

28:52.064 --> 28:55.367
[Charles clapping]

28:55.367 --> 28:56.903
- Wonderful.

28:56.903 --> 29:00.272
You see, it is possible for
you, Kelly, to hit a target.

29:00.272 --> 29:03.175
All you needed was
the right motivation.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.444
- Yeah. Piece of cake.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.413
Give us something
harder next time.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.848
[Charles chuckles]

29:08.848 --> 29:09.882
You got our supplies?

29:10.850 --> 29:12.384
- Of course. Apologies.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.525
I believe I told you
what I wanted, Kelly.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.028
Well done. Good night.

29:23.629 --> 29:26.632
- I got your likes. Let us go.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.567
- No, you two are in
this together now.

29:29.501 --> 29:30.937
But I will make you a deal:

29:32.371 --> 29:36.308
if you hit the next target,
Kelly, I'll let one of you go.

29:36.308 --> 29:38.244
I'll let you guys pick who.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.012
But for now,

29:40.012 --> 29:41.680
how about we get your
friend out of her chains?

29:41.680 --> 29:43.682
Not her handcuffs.

29:43.682 --> 29:46.618
And eight hours sleep and
maybe some food and water.

29:47.753 --> 29:48.855
That sound good?

29:50.256 --> 29:51.290
Good night, ladies.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.360
- Hey, question.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.929
Where the fuck are we supposed
to go to the bathroom?

30:02.401 --> 30:03.735
Are you fucking kidding me?

30:05.171 --> 30:07.874
And you got to record us,
you fucking twisted asshole?

30:07.874 --> 30:10.142
- I'm sorry it's not
the Four Seasons, Kelly.

30:11.743 --> 30:14.847
But you may think me a
psychopath, that's the only area

30:14.847 --> 30:16.916
of this room my
cameras cannot see.

30:16.916 --> 30:20.452
So I assure you, your
dignity will remain intact.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.422
You won't be violated like that.

30:24.756 --> 30:25.791
Goodnight, ladies.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.429
- I'm going to
record more messages.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.831
- No.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.201
We should wait to see what's
going to come back first.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.738
- But we can't send anything
until he is in the room.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.740
We need to prerecord something.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.509
- We don't have
anything new though.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.013
- It's not just that.

30:47.013 --> 30:47.813
- What?

30:50.049 --> 30:50.849
- My battery.

30:51.817 --> 30:52.818
- On your watch?

30:52.818 --> 30:54.820
- No, the watch is fine for now.

30:54.820 --> 30:55.654
It's on my phone.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.890
- Oh.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.258
Does he have your passcode?

30:59.258 --> 31:00.459
- No.
- Then you'll be good.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.328
If you don't use a
phone, it won't drain.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.097
- That's true I hope.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.201
- What's wrong?

31:14.073 --> 31:17.576
- I'm going to record something
for my family just in case.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.645
- You don't have to do that,

31:19.645 --> 31:21.613
because we will beat
this fucker, okay?

31:23.015 --> 31:24.583
- You should probably
do the same thing.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.685
- No. No.

31:26.685 --> 31:27.853
I won't.

31:27.853 --> 31:28.720
And you know why?

31:29.922 --> 31:31.523
- Cause we're going
to beat this fucker.

31:32.458 --> 31:33.292
- Exactly.

31:35.761 --> 31:38.564
I found a spot near the
bathroom to hide the watch,

31:38.564 --> 31:40.799
just in case anything
happens to me.

31:40.799 --> 31:41.633
- Okay.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.137
- Keep your messages
short, it'll send faster.

31:57.816 --> 32:00.552
Hey, mom, hey, dad.

32:03.122 --> 32:06.158
Just want to send this message
and tell you I love you.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.330
[buzzer beeping]

32:23.709 --> 32:24.710
How many?

32:24.710 --> 32:26.045
- Let me think.

32:26.045 --> 32:26.945
- How many?

32:26.945 --> 32:28.047
- [Kelly] Hold on.

32:28.047 --> 32:28.880
- Kelly!

32:30.816 --> 32:32.051
- 10,000.

32:32.051 --> 32:32.884
- 10,000?!

32:34.353 --> 32:36.222
Are you fucking kidding me?
- It's okay, we can do this.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.223
- In how long?

32:37.223 --> 32:38.957
- Two hours.
- Two hours?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.259
That's not enough time.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.428
- I've done it
before, we can do it.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.596
- It's not enough fucking time.

32:44.596 --> 32:45.664
- Help me.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.499
- Well, strip tease.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.734
- Come on.

32:48.734 --> 32:49.868
- You're wearing half
of nothing already,

32:49.868 --> 32:51.137
what fucking difference
does it make?

32:51.137 --> 32:52.404
Post a bunch of photos.

32:52.404 --> 32:55.074
- Okay, yeah. Strip
tease. Different post.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.675
I'll spread them out.
- What?

32:56.675 --> 32:58.377
- I'll post every three
minutes then hopefully

32:58.377 --> 32:59.478
it'll fill out this timeline.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.946
- Well, is that going to work?

33:00.946 --> 33:02.681
- It's worth a try. Start
thinking of captions.

33:02.681 --> 33:03.482
- Kelly.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.018
- What?

33:07.586 --> 33:09.121
- We're smart girls, right?

33:09.121 --> 33:11.223
- Yeah. It's the
boys that are stupid.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.027
- It's not that it's just,

33:15.027 --> 33:16.562
we're jumping through hoops.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.197
We're playing a game
of cat and mouse

33:18.197 --> 33:20.766
and you know the only
way to get out of that.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.168
- How?

33:22.168 --> 33:23.635
- Stop being the mouse.

33:23.635 --> 33:24.970
- I have to play his game.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.472
- Why?

33:26.472 --> 33:27.739
- Because next time he will
be more than a fucking toe

33:27.739 --> 33:28.807
he will take from me.

33:30.276 --> 33:31.643
- Or a kidney.

33:31.643 --> 33:32.911
- Yeah.

33:32.911 --> 33:34.980
I'm trying not to
think about that.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.916
But if we win, he
will let you go.

33:37.916 --> 33:39.951
- He said either one of us.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.054
- That's a fight
we will have later.

33:42.054 --> 33:42.888
Okay?

33:44.723 --> 33:45.724
When we win.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.661
- You really think we can win?

33:56.902 --> 33:58.737
- I want a series of pictures.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.972
- [Charles] Standing by
on your command, Kelly.

34:04.943 --> 34:05.777
- Go.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.480
[camera clicks]

34:23.862 --> 34:25.030
[camera clicks]

34:31.470 --> 34:32.838
[camera clicks]

34:41.947 --> 34:43.315
Spread these out.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.583
- [Charles] Over how long?

34:44.583 --> 34:45.417
- Three minutes.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.887
- Caption for the first image?

34:50.256 --> 34:53.459
- Whoever gets me to 10,000
gets a spicy surprise.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.494
- [Charles] Well, that's
inspiring, miss Weaver.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.062
- Post it.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.830
- [Charles] Is
there anything else?

34:58.830 --> 34:59.731
- No.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.533
Yes, yes, hashtags.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.470
Hashtag hot,

35:04.470 --> 35:06.272
hashtag cheerleader,

35:06.272 --> 35:08.140
hashtag escort,

35:08.140 --> 35:09.275
hashtag call girl,

35:09.275 --> 35:10.342
hashtag,

35:12.544 --> 35:13.379
just post it.

35:20.051 --> 35:25.056
[counter beeping]
[tense music]

35:30.929 --> 35:33.031
We're not going to
make it in time.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.633
- Shit.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.934
- Wait.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.503
Wait, I have an idea.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.373
We're going to record
one more message.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.874
- Saying what?

35:42.874 --> 35:44.910
- That whoever can,
to find me on social.

35:46.044 --> 35:46.878
- Okay, then what?

35:46.878 --> 35:48.214
- Then buy us followers.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.916
Buy us followers to
get us across the line.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.385
- I can't send a message
unless he's in the room.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.520
- I'll get him in here.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.656
Just get your messages ready.

35:57.656 --> 35:58.490
- Okay.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.198
- Hey, dickhead.

36:07.132 --> 36:08.567
I need something.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.970
- Miss Weaver, do you remember
where rudeness gets you?

36:11.970 --> 36:12.904
- Yeah, sorry.

36:15.641 --> 36:16.808
I need props.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.578
- We've completed the posting.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.313
- No.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.050
You never told me how many
posts I was allowed to do.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.754
- What is it you require.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.057
- Whipped cream.

36:32.057 --> 36:33.292
- [Charles] I see.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.093
Sadly, I don't have any on hand.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.498
- Well, I need it to
get across the line.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.134
- Very well. I'll
need 10 minutes.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.039
- Then put 10 minutes
back on the clock then.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.275
- No.

36:49.275 --> 36:51.343
No, you have a time limit.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.578
- Then hurry the fuck up!

36:54.446 --> 36:55.281
Fuck.

36:57.783 --> 37:02.721
[timer beeping]
[tense music]

37:03.955 --> 37:06.258
- I don't think we're
going to make it.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.993
- We're going to
make it. Trust me.

37:10.796 --> 37:11.963
- He's coming.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.104
- The supplies you requested.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.507
- Only one can?

37:22.674 --> 37:24.310
- Don't play with
me, little girl.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.012
You'll get burned.

37:29.348 --> 37:30.181
- Hey.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.185
- You've been told my name.

37:35.621 --> 37:36.455
- Charlie.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.625
- Excuse me?
- Charles, sorry.

37:39.625 --> 37:40.459
Charles.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.562
- Yes, miss Weaver?

37:46.898 --> 37:48.367
- What am I allowed to post?

37:49.435 --> 37:50.336
- Anything at all.

37:52.137 --> 37:52.971
- Anything?

37:59.978 --> 38:00.746
- No.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.614
Not that.

38:04.249 --> 38:07.218
I'm afraid I don't control
social media censorship.

38:10.322 --> 38:11.790
- Censorship?

38:14.393 --> 38:15.761
- I'm sure you
know, miss Weaver,

38:15.761 --> 38:18.664
nobody can post any
nudity on social media.

38:18.664 --> 38:21.166
It would be reported
and flagged and removed

38:21.166 --> 38:23.369
for inappropriate content.

38:23.369 --> 38:24.470
I'm sure you know that.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.104
- And if I had whipped cream?

38:27.272 --> 38:28.640
- Then I'm sure you're fine

38:30.609 --> 38:31.577
- Funny world, huh?

38:33.345 --> 38:34.179
- Indeed.

38:35.547 --> 38:38.450
Social media just masquerading
at having a conscience,

38:38.450 --> 38:41.019
whilst all the time trying
to sexualize everything.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.157
Good luck.

38:48.293 --> 38:49.895
- I want that extra 10 minutes.

38:53.932 --> 38:56.134
- You really think
it's going to help you?

38:56.134 --> 38:56.968
- I do.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.038
- Fine. Extra 10 minutes.

39:05.411 --> 39:06.678
- Did it go through?

39:06.678 --> 39:07.713
- Yes.

39:07.713 --> 39:08.980
- Oh my god. Okay.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.015
- You got a voice note reply.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.016
- I want to see.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.350
- He'll see.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.520
- No, no, I'll be
careful, trust me.

39:19.458 --> 39:22.293
- Hello, Sabrina and Kelly,
this is Detective Langley.

39:22.293 --> 39:24.963
We received your messages
and understand the situation.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.433
If you could help us out by
describing your environment;

39:27.433 --> 39:28.700
what the walls are made out of,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.502
what the floor is like,

39:30.502 --> 39:32.871
if there's any traffic
noises from outside,

39:32.871 --> 39:34.506
anything that you can tell
us that might help us lead us

39:34.506 --> 39:35.774
to you.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.308
We have many people
searching right now.

39:37.308 --> 39:41.179
I know your posts are forced
and you're not really safe.

39:41.179 --> 39:43.482
I appreciate the need for
discretion with your messages.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.316
Let's communicate
short and frequent.

39:46.284 --> 39:47.786
We will find you.

39:47.786 --> 39:48.620
I promise.

39:51.356 --> 39:52.691
- Hello.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.560
It's Kelly Weaver.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.561
We're in some,

39:56.762 --> 39:58.697
industrial building
out of the city.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.901
There's some big,
large, narrow windows.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.503
I can't see really through them.

40:05.937 --> 40:09.174
The wall is made from red brick.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.077
One more thing.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.546
The guy is British.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.548
He's telling me his
name is Charles,

40:16.548 --> 40:18.249
but it's probably bullshit.

40:20.285 --> 40:22.320
Actually, I don't
know, cause he's crazy.

40:23.722 --> 40:26.892
He has been setting me some
social media challenges.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.394
Just me, not Sabrina,
and he's saying that

40:29.394 --> 40:32.363
if I don't do
them, he will kill.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.433
Just find us, okay?

40:37.302 --> 40:38.103
- Kelly.

40:42.541 --> 40:46.712
[timer beeping]
[tense music]

40:46.712 --> 40:48.714
- Hope they got the message.

40:48.714 --> 40:52.017
[tense music continues]

40:54.586 --> 40:55.386
- Come on.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.060
This is it.

41:04.530 --> 41:05.463
Come on.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.297
Come on.

41:09.501 --> 41:12.270
[bright chiming]

41:18.577 --> 41:19.410
- Whoa.

41:22.981 --> 41:23.815
Holy shit.

41:25.717 --> 41:26.718
- No.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.186
Fuck, they need to stop.

41:29.354 --> 41:30.188
Shit.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.224
- It's too many.

41:38.797 --> 41:40.899
- It's too many, he's going
to know something's up.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.044
- I did it.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.417
- Is that a victory statement
or some admission of guilt?

42:00.285 --> 42:01.186
- What?

42:01.186 --> 42:02.954
- "I did it."
- Yeah.

42:02.954 --> 42:03.889
- Yeah what?

42:03.889 --> 42:05.223
- I completed your task.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.725
- No you didn't, you cheated.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.595
Cause the last thousand likes
that you got are from bots.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.366
- What do you want
me to tell you?

42:15.366 --> 42:16.835
Probably some guy was
trying to see my tits

42:16.835 --> 42:18.036
and get me to 10,000.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.038
I don't know.
- No!

42:20.038 --> 42:22.774
You cheated. The
only question is how.

42:22.774 --> 42:23.909
- I didn't.

42:27.846 --> 42:30.949
- Kelly, do you remember
I don't like lies?

42:30.949 --> 42:31.950
- You never said that.

42:31.950 --> 42:32.818
- Really?

42:33.752 --> 42:35.654
- You know what you said though?

42:35.654 --> 42:37.689
You said that you
would never lie to me.

42:37.689 --> 42:40.759
You said that if we hit the
target, you'd let one of us go.

42:40.759 --> 42:42.327
So let her go.
- [Sabrina] No!

42:42.327 --> 42:45.063
- Prove to me you're not
a liar and release her.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.331
- No.
- Yes, release her.

42:46.331 --> 42:47.165
- No.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.035
- Wow.

42:50.035 --> 42:51.970
Now this is getting
interesting, huh?

42:51.970 --> 42:54.172
So you cheat at my game,

42:54.172 --> 42:56.041
but you're starting to act
like a human being, Kelly

42:56.041 --> 42:58.276
to release your friend
rather than yourself?

42:58.276 --> 42:59.477
What's that feel like?

43:01.647 --> 43:04.482
- You're a liar if
you don't let her go.

43:04.482 --> 43:06.051
- Tell me how you cheated.

43:07.318 --> 43:08.253
- I didn't.

43:10.155 --> 43:13.491
- If you tell me how
I'll spare your life.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.194
- For what?

43:17.595 --> 43:19.097
To play another one of your
fucking games tomorrow?

43:19.097 --> 43:21.132
No, fuck that. Release her!

43:27.038 --> 43:27.873
- All right.

43:29.675 --> 43:31.877
- No. Wait.
- Five,

43:33.278 --> 43:34.112
four,

43:37.182 --> 43:38.750
three,

43:38.750 --> 43:39.584
two.

43:39.584 --> 43:41.186
- Stop! I did it.

43:41.186 --> 43:42.187
It was me.

43:42.187 --> 43:43.221
- No she didn't.
- Yes, I did it!

43:43.221 --> 43:44.289
I cheated!
- She didn't, it was me.

43:44.289 --> 43:46.291
Yes I did, I cheated.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.125
- You did?

43:47.125 --> 43:48.226
- Yes.
- No she didn't.

43:48.226 --> 43:49.494
- Yes I did!

43:49.494 --> 43:50.428
I didn't want you
to know about it.

43:50.428 --> 43:52.097
I reprogrammed the phone.

43:52.097 --> 43:54.733
I bought us followers, I
know my dad's credit card.

43:54.733 --> 43:57.368
- You. You've got this
sort of skill set?

43:57.368 --> 43:58.303
- No, no.
- Yes.

43:58.303 --> 43:59.470
Yes, yes, I didn't.

43:59.470 --> 44:00.706
Yes I did. It's the truth.

44:00.706 --> 44:02.473
- No she didn't.
- Yes, yes I did.

44:02.473 --> 44:04.810
But she would've done it
anyways, she was almost there,

44:04.810 --> 44:06.111
it was just a backup plan.

44:08.079 --> 44:08.980
- So you did this?

44:08.980 --> 44:09.815
- Yes.
- Alone?

44:09.815 --> 44:11.349
- Yes.

44:11.349 --> 44:12.583
- Kelly, I didn't want you
to know anything about it.

44:12.583 --> 44:13.785
I did it all by
myself, I promise.

44:13.785 --> 44:15.186
I promise, I'm
telling the truth.

44:17.923 --> 44:18.757
- Show me.

44:21.960 --> 44:22.794
So do it again.

44:23.829 --> 44:24.662
Show me.

44:26.231 --> 44:28.066
- [Sabrina stammering]

44:28.066 --> 44:30.035
Don't tell me about it, show me!

44:30.035 --> 44:31.336
Do it again!

44:33.671 --> 44:35.240
Do it again.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.574
Do it again.

44:36.574 --> 44:38.676
Do it again. Do it again!

44:42.714 --> 44:44.182
Do it again.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.451
You can't, can you?

44:49.387 --> 44:52.290
You can't do it because you
never did it in the first place.

44:52.290 --> 44:55.060
You're lying. That's
the first thing I know.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.062
And if you didn't then she did.

44:57.062 --> 44:57.896
Right?

45:03.568 --> 45:05.737
And let me tell you
the last thing I know.

45:07.172 --> 45:08.673
Nobody here's on their period.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.409
The box is full.

45:13.078 --> 45:14.579
- There's been a lot going on.

45:15.781 --> 45:18.016
- Let me tell you what's
going on here, Sabrina,

45:18.016 --> 45:21.219
Kelly isn't taking this
game very seriously.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.454
This game that's
playing with your life,

45:24.455 --> 45:26.657
but we can correct that.
[gun slicks]

45:26.657 --> 45:27.492
- No! No!

45:28.860 --> 45:31.863
[Sabrina screaming]

45:34.265 --> 45:35.100
No.

45:37.468 --> 45:39.404
I'll play your game, I swear.

45:40.638 --> 45:43.842
No, I'll play your
game, I swear.

45:46.377 --> 45:49.447
No, I'll play your
game, I swear. No.

45:51.316 --> 45:53.885
[gun bangs]
[blood splatters]

46:04.762 --> 46:05.696
It's Kelly.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.603
Sabrina has been murdered.

46:15.206 --> 46:16.307
He shot her.

46:19.177 --> 46:20.912
He shot her because I cheated.

46:27.819 --> 46:29.654
He fucking killed her.

46:33.024 --> 46:35.793
He wants me to learn a
lesson about all this, but

46:40.431 --> 46:41.266
what lesson?

46:47.105 --> 46:48.273
I tried to protect her

46:52.410 --> 46:53.244
and

46:55.013 --> 46:56.714
she died trying to protect me.

47:21.772 --> 47:22.974
You killed her.

47:25.043 --> 47:27.345
- [Charles] No, you did.

47:28.813 --> 47:30.916
The minute you decided
not to play fair.

47:32.783 --> 47:34.152
But it's okay.

47:35.020 --> 47:36.321
We'll play again tomorrow.

47:37.655 --> 47:38.656
Would you like that?

47:39.757 --> 47:40.591
- No.

47:45.096 --> 47:46.864
- You can still
make it out, Kelly.

47:48.366 --> 47:49.634
- I know.

47:51.202 --> 47:52.904
Cause you're still
wearing a mask.

47:53.804 --> 47:54.639
- That's right.

47:56.908 --> 47:58.709
- But I'm not going to.

48:00.078 --> 48:01.746
- You're not going
to make it out?

48:01.746 --> 48:02.680
- No.

48:04.215 --> 48:05.984
I'm not going to play your game.

48:07.785 --> 48:09.220
Just kill me already.

48:11.056 --> 48:12.757
- But why, Kelly?

48:12.757 --> 48:14.759
I don't intend on killing you.

48:17.828 --> 48:19.164
- But you did with Sabrina.

48:20.098 --> 48:21.866
- Sabrina was part of my plan.

48:24.269 --> 48:25.070
- What was she?

48:26.071 --> 48:27.872
- She was collateral damage.

48:31.142 --> 48:32.643
- And what am I?

48:32.643 --> 48:36.814
- Oh no, you're something
much, much more special.

48:38.249 --> 48:41.152
I never intended to test any
of Sabrina's capabilities

48:41.152 --> 48:42.520
like I do yours.

48:44.122 --> 48:46.024
I want to set you free.

48:50.561 --> 48:51.729
- Then let me out.

48:52.964 --> 48:55.967
[Charles chuckles]

48:55.967 --> 48:57.335
- Aren't you missing the
bit where you promised

48:57.335 --> 48:59.004
not to tell the police about me?

49:15.553 --> 49:16.554
- We're passed that.

49:19.890 --> 49:20.758
Listen to me.

49:22.260 --> 49:25.363
If I ever get out of here,

49:25.363 --> 49:28.933
I'll be dedicating every
fucking second of my life

49:28.933 --> 49:32.737
to help them track you
and bring you to justice.

49:32.737 --> 49:34.172
- Is that right?

49:34.172 --> 49:35.006
- Yeah.

49:36.441 --> 49:37.842
But you won't let me out.

49:40.645 --> 49:41.979
I heard your voice.

49:43.914 --> 49:44.949
I know your name.

49:47.018 --> 49:48.719
I saw what you did to Sabrina.

49:50.355 --> 49:51.589
You can't let me out.

49:53.858 --> 49:56.494
- You know for somebody
with such a smart mind,

49:56.494 --> 49:59.730
capable of the long
game, it's amazing

49:59.730 --> 50:04.001
that you gravitated to a short
term, instant gratification.

50:07.372 --> 50:08.539
- It's not a long game.

50:10.608 --> 50:11.576
It's a short one.

50:13.111 --> 50:14.712
And in 24 hours,

50:17.048 --> 50:17.882
I'll be dead.

50:20.218 --> 50:23.088
The choice is still yours.

50:27.992 --> 50:29.360
- But I don't want to play.

50:34.865 --> 50:37.768
- The ship is still
yours, Theseus.

50:42.573 --> 50:45.476
Kelly, some pieces
of wood are rotten,

50:45.476 --> 50:48.913
they need to be
replaced, that's all.

50:50.248 --> 50:51.048
- So what?

50:52.550 --> 50:54.419
You're going to cut
another defenseless girl

50:54.419 --> 50:55.553
or murder another woman?

50:55.553 --> 50:57.455
Is that what you're going to do?

50:57.455 --> 51:00.625
- What happened with
Sabrina was a tragedy

51:00.625 --> 51:02.693
and it's changed
you, maybe forever.

51:03.861 --> 51:08.699
But maybe, just maybe
it's a piece of you

51:09.434 --> 51:10.801
that needed to change.

51:12.737 --> 51:15.906
Otherwise, how will you
ever see something new?

51:18.843 --> 51:21.846
So play my game.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.522
- I'm not going to
play your fucking game.

51:38.028 --> 51:39.029
- All right.

51:40.198 --> 51:41.999
Kelly won't play my game.

51:44.034 --> 51:48.406
So I will stimulate you
the only way I know how.

51:50.641 --> 51:53.278
You're going to play
for someone else.

51:53.278 --> 51:54.845
- No, no, don't.

51:56.481 --> 52:00.117
- You give me no choice.
- No, please don't do that.

52:00.117 --> 52:00.985
Please.

52:17.202 --> 52:18.035
- Hey.

52:23.974 --> 52:24.809
Hey!

52:26.311 --> 52:27.278
What's going on?

52:32.417 --> 52:34.185
- What the fuck?

52:34.185 --> 52:35.019
- Hey, what's going on?

52:35.019 --> 52:36.654
- No, no, no, no.

52:36.654 --> 52:39.023
Shut up. Get her
out of here, please!

52:39.023 --> 52:41.459
Okay, I'll play your game,
but for myself, not for her.

52:41.459 --> 52:42.727
- Who are you talking to?

52:42.727 --> 52:44.462
- Shut up.

52:45.396 --> 52:47.198
- Did you put me here?

52:47.198 --> 52:48.666
- Shit.
- Talk to me.

52:50.134 --> 52:51.969
You've got the wrong girl,
my name is Jill and I didn't-

52:51.969 --> 52:53.738
- Shut up.

52:53.738 --> 52:56.441
I don't want to know anything
about you, is that clear?

52:57.608 --> 52:58.409
- Okay.

52:59.610 --> 53:01.045
- You hear me? Get
her out of here.

53:01.045 --> 53:02.413
I'll play your game, I swear.

53:03.681 --> 53:04.515
- Got it.

53:08.085 --> 53:09.019
[buzzer beeping]
What?

53:11.322 --> 53:12.390
What is that?

53:15.393 --> 53:17.194
- Did someone sign me up
for one of those extreme

53:17.194 --> 53:19.664
escape room experiences?

53:19.664 --> 53:21.131
- What?

53:21.131 --> 53:23.067
- Shouldn't I have been given
a safe word or something?

53:23.067 --> 53:25.370
Turkey baster or-
- This isn't that.

53:28.673 --> 53:29.507
- You mean,

53:32.009 --> 53:33.010
this is real?

53:33.010 --> 53:34.111
- Yeah.

53:34.111 --> 53:35.112
Yeah, this is real.

53:40.651 --> 53:42.152
- Don't leave.

53:42.152 --> 53:42.987
- I can't.

53:45.423 --> 53:46.257
Neither can you.

53:47.325 --> 53:48.926
- Should at least try something.

53:56.534 --> 53:58.369
- [Langley] Kelly,
we got your message.

53:58.369 --> 54:00.004
We are going to get
you out of there.

54:00.004 --> 54:01.939
Tonight, we'll try to
pin your location down.

54:01.939 --> 54:04.609
We'll be launching
single fireworks across
various locations

54:04.609 --> 54:06.076
that match your description.

54:06.076 --> 54:09.213
When you hear it, note the exact
time and send us a message.

54:09.213 --> 54:11.749
If you hear more than
one, try to note each time

54:11.749 --> 54:13.384
and which sounded closer.

54:13.384 --> 54:15.820
One other thing; if you
can get him to go out

54:15.820 --> 54:19.557
and buy something unique,
something not so common,

54:19.557 --> 54:21.592
we can track purchases
if we know what it was

54:21.592 --> 54:24.128
and what time roughly
it was bought.

54:24.128 --> 54:26.531
Sit tight, Kelly, we
are getting closer.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.168
- Hi, detective.

54:31.168 --> 54:32.703
Sabrina has been murdered.

54:34.138 --> 54:37.074
He got another girl in, I
don't know her name yet.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.311
Yesterday I got him
out of the building,

54:40.311 --> 54:44.549
I made him buy whipped
cream around 9:00, 10:00 PM,

54:44.549 --> 54:45.416
I don't remember.

54:46.751 --> 54:49.387
And okay, I will listen
to the fireworks.

54:49.387 --> 54:50.287
Thank you so much.

54:57.928 --> 54:58.763
- Hey!

55:00.164 --> 55:01.165
Are you okay?

55:02.967 --> 55:07.104
- Kelly, I've decided that
this will be a two player game.

55:11.075 --> 55:12.577
Good luck, ladies.

55:18.349 --> 55:20.818
- Who are you? What are
you bringing to the table?

55:23.888 --> 55:25.255
- Okay.

55:25.255 --> 55:26.724
I'm Jill.

55:26.724 --> 55:28.192
- I don't care about your
name, what can you do?

55:29.560 --> 55:30.595
- I'm funny.

55:31.762 --> 55:33.163
Like pranks,

55:33.163 --> 55:35.065
bit of stand up,
sometimes skits.

55:36.233 --> 55:37.635
- Not sure funny
is going to help.

55:39.003 --> 55:39.904
- Yeah, maybe not.

55:40.771 --> 55:41.606
What works?

55:43.307 --> 55:45.643
- Sex. Sex sells
100% of the time.

55:47.111 --> 55:49.747
- I mean, not really in
the mood right now, but

55:49.747 --> 55:50.748
we've got handcuffs.

55:51.916 --> 55:52.717
- You're funny.

55:54.519 --> 55:56.987
- Yeah, that was
definitely a joke.

55:58.222 --> 55:59.690
- Focus.

55:59.690 --> 56:00.858
- Okay.

56:00.858 --> 56:03.494
Don't cheerleaders
just post sexy pictures

56:03.494 --> 56:05.129
and tease the boys?

56:05.129 --> 56:07.665
- No, I feel this is
all I've been doing.

56:07.665 --> 56:09.867
- I mean, I'm sure it's
more than just that.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.370
All the boys are
going to love it.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.405
- Not my boyfriend.

56:15.339 --> 56:16.173
- Right.

56:17.341 --> 56:18.776
I'm sure that's drama.

56:19.677 --> 56:21.145
- What?

56:21.145 --> 56:23.981
- I'm sure it causes a
lot of relationship drama.

56:23.981 --> 56:24.849
- Yeah, it does.

56:25.983 --> 56:27.785
- Not sure that'll
make for a good post.

56:31.489 --> 56:32.389
- No, no, wait.

56:32.389 --> 56:33.624
Yeah.

56:33.624 --> 56:34.759
It will.

56:34.759 --> 56:36.126
People love drama, right?

56:36.961 --> 56:38.729
- Yeah. They do?

56:38.729 --> 56:39.564
- Yeah.

56:44.234 --> 56:46.537
I need a video for this
one. Can you do that?

56:47.705 --> 56:48.706
- As you wish.

56:51.842 --> 56:52.677
- Take it off.

56:53.944 --> 56:55.880
You need to follow
my leave here, okay?

56:58.148 --> 56:59.517
Okay, put your hands on me.

57:00.785 --> 57:02.186
Start recording.

57:02.186 --> 57:03.287
- [Charles] Recording.

57:14.732 --> 57:16.233
- Hi, Ryan.

57:16.233 --> 57:18.703
I just wanted to
tell you, it's over.

57:18.703 --> 57:20.004
I break up with you.

57:20.004 --> 57:21.038
We're done.

57:21.038 --> 57:23.073
You see her? That's Jill.

57:23.073 --> 57:25.476
She's my new squeeze,
my new girlfriend.

57:25.476 --> 57:26.811
When I send her a
picture in my underwear,

57:26.811 --> 57:28.012
she's there in five minutes.

57:28.012 --> 57:29.580
She picks up my call,
she's there for me

57:29.580 --> 57:31.882
and let me tell you, she
rocked my world in the bedroom

57:31.882 --> 57:33.884
more than you ever did.

57:33.884 --> 57:36.020
Oh, say hi to your dog for me.

57:47.698 --> 57:48.533
Cut.

57:57.307 --> 57:58.242
Give me tags.

57:58.242 --> 57:59.744
- Tags?
- Hashtags.

57:59.744 --> 58:00.678
- Yeah, right.

58:01.546 --> 58:03.548
Cheating, hashtag dumped,

58:03.548 --> 58:04.381
over you,

58:05.816 --> 58:07.618
hashtag-
- Hashtag sex,

58:07.618 --> 58:09.286
hashtag girl, hashtag lesbian,

58:09.286 --> 58:11.221
hashtag hot,
hashtag cheerleader,

58:11.221 --> 58:13.190
hashtag horny, hashtag cosplay,

58:13.190 --> 58:14.424
hashtag daddy issues,

58:14.424 --> 58:16.460
hashtag hot, hashtag very hot.

58:18.563 --> 58:19.396
Is that good?

58:20.531 --> 58:22.166
- Yeah. I think
you got it covered.

58:25.636 --> 58:26.904
- Post it.

58:26.904 --> 58:28.639
- [Charles] It's been posted.

58:28.639 --> 58:31.308
[timer beeping]

58:34.378 --> 58:36.614
- That performance back there

58:36.614 --> 58:37.882
came all too easy.

58:39.116 --> 58:40.651
- Please.

58:40.651 --> 58:42.587
You had the chance to make
out with a hot cheerleader

58:42.587 --> 58:43.621
and for free.

58:45.055 --> 58:47.792
You'll probably get millions
of new followers anyways.

58:49.760 --> 58:50.861
- I have a girlfriend.

58:52.162 --> 58:56.133
- Oh, shit, I'm sorry,
I didn't know that.

58:56.133 --> 58:58.803
- Don't worry about it. We
have bigger things on our mind.

58:58.803 --> 59:01.271
- Yeah, and you know what,
maybe this will help us

59:01.271 --> 59:03.608
to reach the target and we
can go home and everything

59:03.608 --> 59:04.842
will be fine.

59:04.842 --> 59:07.044
- Yeah, okay, I get it,
but where's the limit?

59:07.044 --> 59:09.847
- I mean, we're not allowed
to post anything too sexual.

59:09.847 --> 59:11.415
It just wouldn't post.

59:12.482 --> 59:13.818
- I know, want a shame.

59:15.285 --> 59:16.553
Cause if there's no limit,
then you can just fuck me

59:16.553 --> 59:18.355
for views and then
we can go around,

59:18.355 --> 59:20.591
find a homeless guy and
hunt him down for sport.

59:20.591 --> 59:22.860
Go around town, finding
every handicap kid

59:22.860 --> 59:24.561
and calling them
a bunch of cunts.

59:25.429 --> 59:26.897
- Would you relax?

59:26.897 --> 59:29.033
- Would you just take a
minute and be a human being?

59:29.033 --> 59:30.567
- For what?

59:30.567 --> 59:32.937
Do you think being a human
being is going to save us?

59:32.937 --> 59:36.040
- Being whatever you are
being isn't worth saving.

59:36.040 --> 59:36.874
- What?

59:38.042 --> 59:40.711
- Just would you
try and be decent?

59:40.711 --> 59:41.879
- I am.

59:41.879 --> 59:43.213
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

59:45.215 --> 59:46.050
- What's my name?

59:48.452 --> 59:51.321
- Um, it's, Jennifer.

59:53.390 --> 59:54.224
- Jill.

59:55.492 --> 59:56.293
- Close enough.

59:59.697 --> 1:00:00.530
- Will it work?

1:00:03.133 --> 1:00:04.368
- It should.

1:00:04.368 --> 1:00:06.270
Ryan has over 200,000 followers.

1:00:06.270 --> 1:00:07.171
We should be good.

1:00:08.973 --> 1:00:10.775
- I'd really like
another take at that.

1:00:10.775 --> 1:00:12.843
I could have helped if I
knew what was going on.

1:00:12.843 --> 1:00:13.778
- Relax.

1:00:14.779 --> 1:00:15.946
It's not our only hope.

1:00:17.147 --> 1:00:18.015
- What?

1:00:18.015 --> 1:00:19.516
- Sabrina.

1:00:19.516 --> 1:00:21.886
The girl that was there before
you, she left a smart watch

1:00:21.886 --> 1:00:23.821
and I've been in
communication with the police.

1:00:23.821 --> 1:00:25.222
They're trying to track us.

1:00:26.423 --> 1:00:27.758
- Smart.

1:00:27.758 --> 1:00:29.994
- Maybe. Maybe not.

1:00:29.994 --> 1:00:31.428
- Why say that?

1:00:31.428 --> 1:00:33.898
- Well, the Bluetooth connects
every time he comes in

1:00:33.898 --> 1:00:36.967
on Sabrina's phone, which
helped the messages to send.

1:00:37.868 --> 1:00:38.836
- So?

1:00:38.836 --> 1:00:40.671
- And so Sabrina is dead.

1:00:40.671 --> 1:00:44.041
Maybe he got rid of her phone
or whatever, we don't know.

1:00:46.643 --> 1:00:48.879
- What exactly
happened to Sabrina?

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:52.449
- Let's not talk
about that, okay?

1:00:55.085 --> 1:00:56.687
- Well, there's two
of us and one of him.

1:00:56.687 --> 1:00:58.288
- He has a gun

1:00:58.288 --> 1:01:00.758
and he's fast and he's strong.

1:01:00.758 --> 1:01:02.526
- For one person.

1:01:02.526 --> 1:01:04.461
If one of us can get past
him, we can get to the door

1:01:04.461 --> 1:01:06.030
when he comes through.

1:01:06.030 --> 1:01:08.065
- We don't know
what's out there.

1:01:08.065 --> 1:01:09.366
- Better off than in here.

1:01:09.366 --> 1:01:10.868
- We could split his focus.

1:01:10.868 --> 1:01:12.136
- Okay.

1:01:12.136 --> 1:01:14.104
I'll attack him, you
run for the door.

1:01:14.104 --> 1:01:15.605
- Okay, and what about you?

1:01:15.605 --> 1:01:17.141
- Get help once you're outside.

1:01:17.141 --> 1:01:19.009
- Maybe we're in the
middle of nowhere.

1:01:19.009 --> 1:01:21.611
- Again, a chance
I'm willing to take.

1:01:21.611 --> 1:01:23.113
- But he could kill you.

1:01:23.113 --> 1:01:25.950
- Haven't you been here long
enough already? I know I have.

1:01:25.950 --> 1:01:28.485
I just, I want to go home.

1:01:29.553 --> 1:01:31.421
[firework pops]

1:01:31.421 --> 1:01:32.923
- What time is it?

1:01:32.923 --> 1:01:34.224
- What was that?

1:01:34.224 --> 1:01:35.425
- A single firework.

1:01:36.293 --> 1:01:37.194
- You sure?

1:01:37.194 --> 1:01:38.729
- Do you have the time?

1:01:38.729 --> 1:01:39.563
- No.

1:01:39.563 --> 1:01:40.397
- Okay, stay here.

1:01:46.270 --> 1:01:48.038
It's 11:15.

1:01:48.038 --> 1:01:49.639
I heard a firework.

1:01:49.639 --> 1:01:51.475
I'm keeping it short.
Battery is low.

1:01:54.244 --> 1:01:55.512
We need to get him in here.

1:01:55.512 --> 1:01:57.081
- Why?

1:01:57.081 --> 1:02:00.084
- Because the message needs
to send and it's very low.

1:02:01.085 --> 1:02:03.320
- Okay, how much
time do we have?

1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:04.922
- Minutes.

1:02:04.922 --> 1:02:05.756
- Okay.

1:02:12.562 --> 1:02:14.564
Quit treating me like the enemy!

1:02:14.564 --> 1:02:15.499
- What are you doing?

1:02:15.499 --> 1:02:17.301
- You heard me, you bitch!

1:02:17.301 --> 1:02:19.870
I'm not going to let
you walk all over me.

1:02:19.870 --> 1:02:21.705
If she's going to choose
someone, it's going to be me.

1:02:21.705 --> 1:02:23.207
Sure as hell not
going to be you.

1:02:23.207 --> 1:02:24.641
I've got so much to live for.

1:02:24.641 --> 1:02:26.410
You've got shit, girl!

1:02:26.410 --> 1:02:27.444
- Stop!

1:02:27.444 --> 1:02:28.512
Stop fighting!

1:02:29.713 --> 1:02:30.614
- Oh, fuck off.

1:02:30.614 --> 1:02:31.782
- Hey, fuck you!

1:02:32.682 --> 1:02:33.517
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1:02:33.517 --> 1:02:34.351
- Yeah?

1:02:35.786 --> 1:02:38.088
Make it really easy for him
to choose who to set free.

1:02:38.088 --> 1:02:39.356
Kelly, watch out!

1:02:39.356 --> 1:02:40.457
[loud thud]

1:02:46.463 --> 1:02:47.297
- No.

1:02:49.099 --> 1:02:49.934
No, no.

1:02:52.436 --> 1:02:54.404
No, I'll play your game.

1:02:55.505 --> 1:02:56.606
No.

1:02:56.606 --> 1:02:57.942
No.

1:02:57.942 --> 1:02:59.343
I'll play your game.

1:03:04.281 --> 1:03:07.284
[Sabrina screaming]

1:03:15.625 --> 1:03:17.694
[blood splatters]

1:03:17.694 --> 1:03:20.197
[tense music]

1:03:27.504 --> 1:03:30.240
[buzzer beeping]

1:03:43.687 --> 1:03:45.489
- Five likes?

1:03:45.489 --> 1:03:48.458
- I thought I'd make
this a little easier.

1:03:48.458 --> 1:03:51.128
You've had such a
traumatic couple of days,

1:03:51.128 --> 1:03:54.932
and after all, it's quality,
not quantity we're after.

1:03:54.932 --> 1:03:56.000
Right?

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:57.567
- I don't get it.

1:03:57.567 --> 1:03:59.703
- The last video is going
to be a live streamed one.

1:03:59.703 --> 1:04:02.006
You can say whatever you want.

1:04:02.006 --> 1:04:04.074
Think about what you
want your legacy to be

1:04:04.074 --> 1:04:06.410
because at the end
of that live stream,

1:04:08.212 --> 1:04:10.347
I'm going to kill you, Kelly.

1:04:10.347 --> 1:04:12.216
I promise I'll make it painless.

1:04:13.683 --> 1:04:15.485
And you've got 59 minutes
to think about what it is

1:04:15.485 --> 1:04:16.553
you want to say.

1:04:16.553 --> 1:04:17.955
- Yeah, you know what?

1:04:17.955 --> 1:04:18.989
I think I'll pass.

1:04:19.856 --> 1:04:21.625
- You will perform.

1:04:21.625 --> 1:04:24.561
Your followers and
me demand a show,

1:04:24.561 --> 1:04:26.430
so you are going to give us one.

1:04:26.430 --> 1:04:28.832
After all, it's your final one.

1:04:32.702 --> 1:04:33.904
- No.
- [Charles] Kelly.

1:04:33.904 --> 1:04:35.405
- No!

1:04:35.405 --> 1:04:37.441
- [Charles] Saying no only
forces me to find some other

1:04:37.441 --> 1:04:39.709
sacrificial lamb to
put in there with you.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:41.311
- And what's the upside for me?

1:04:41.311 --> 1:04:42.612
- Well, you'll save a life.

1:04:42.612 --> 1:04:43.813
- Of someone I don't know?

1:04:43.813 --> 1:04:45.983
- And does that make
that life less valuable?

1:04:45.983 --> 1:04:47.184
- No.

1:04:47.184 --> 1:04:49.453
But I think I'll
focus on myself now.

1:04:49.453 --> 1:04:52.389
- Kelly, you can use
this time, this platform,

1:04:52.389 --> 1:04:55.892
this huge audience you've
amassed to say whatever it is

1:04:55.892 --> 1:04:59.896
you think is fitting as a
final message for Kelly Weaver.

1:04:59.896 --> 1:05:02.933
It's live stream, so they
won't be able to cut you off.

1:05:02.933 --> 1:05:05.369
And I promise you have
your two minutes to say

1:05:05.369 --> 1:05:06.703
whatever it is you want.

1:05:09.439 --> 1:05:10.941
- Okay, fine.

1:05:10.941 --> 1:05:12.309
Fine, I'll do it.

1:05:12.309 --> 1:05:14.611
They want a performance,
I'll give it to them.

1:05:16.813 --> 1:05:19.049
I just need a few things.

1:05:19.049 --> 1:05:21.285
- What do you need? Is
it more whipped cream?

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:24.454
- No.

1:05:24.454 --> 1:05:25.289
I just want food.

1:05:26.423 --> 1:05:27.724
- [Charles] A last supper.

1:05:28.625 --> 1:05:29.859
Fine.

1:05:29.859 --> 1:05:31.962
I'll have something for
you in a few moments.

1:05:33.797 --> 1:05:34.631
- Take your time.

1:05:36.033 --> 1:05:37.401
There's no tomorrow for me.

1:05:47.611 --> 1:05:48.678
Fuck.

1:05:48.678 --> 1:05:50.180
No, no, no, no, no. Please.

1:05:50.180 --> 1:05:51.015
Fuck.

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:54.851
Fuck!

1:05:54.851 --> 1:05:57.354
[tense music]

1:06:02.759 --> 1:06:05.929
[objects clattering]

1:06:20.777 --> 1:06:22.412
- Bring it on, bitch.

1:06:26.850 --> 1:06:29.186
[TV cracks]

1:06:36.193 --> 1:06:38.695
[TV shatters]

1:06:41.065 --> 1:06:44.634
[driving electronic music]

1:06:48.338 --> 1:06:50.674
[TV cracks]

1:06:52.242 --> 1:06:56.680
[driving electronic
music continues]

1:07:07.491 --> 1:07:12.462
[distant thumping]
[door creaks]

1:07:14.731 --> 1:07:17.234
[tense music]

1:07:50.667 --> 1:07:52.569
- [Charles] You shouldn't
have done that, Kelly.

1:07:54.871 --> 1:07:56.406
Now we have to escalate things.

1:07:59.409 --> 1:08:02.011
[door creaking]

1:08:03.012 --> 1:08:04.848
[door slams]

1:08:18.195 --> 1:08:19.496
- You didn't have to kill her.

1:08:20.430 --> 1:08:21.265
- Which one?

1:08:23.633 --> 1:08:24.901
- Both of them.

1:08:24.901 --> 1:08:26.736
- You see, I felt they
gave me little choice.

1:08:28.372 --> 1:08:29.206
- Why is that?

1:08:30.540 --> 1:08:32.876
- Well, one cheated and
one attacked me, Kelly.

1:08:34.278 --> 1:08:35.979
- And don't you think killing
them was a bit excessive,

1:08:35.979 --> 1:08:37.214
you fucking monster?

1:08:38.382 --> 1:08:40.284
- Wow. Now I've
heard everything.

1:08:40.284 --> 1:08:43.187
A social media influencer
calling me excessive?

1:08:45.555 --> 1:08:46.390
- Fuck you.

1:08:48.525 --> 1:08:51.461
If I ever get out of
here, I will find you

1:08:52.696 --> 1:08:55.098
and make you pay
for what you did.

1:08:55.098 --> 1:08:58.635
- Well, maybe, maybe you can
make a web series out of it.

1:08:58.635 --> 1:08:59.903
- Yeah.

1:08:59.903 --> 1:09:01.438
- Some more content
for your followers.

1:09:01.438 --> 1:09:03.740
- I'll go to prison every day
just to take a picture of you

1:09:03.740 --> 1:09:06.410
to show them how fucking
pathetic of a guy you are.

1:09:07.277 --> 1:09:08.111
Trust me.

1:09:09.646 --> 1:09:11.114
- Is that right?

1:09:11.114 --> 1:09:12.549
- Yeah.

1:09:12.549 --> 1:09:14.751
- Well, let me help you out.

1:09:19.155 --> 1:09:20.690
Well, you already know my name.

1:09:22.359 --> 1:09:24.861
- But let me help
you a little more.

1:09:28.632 --> 1:09:30.400
Now you know what I look like.

1:09:31.535 --> 1:09:35.038
I hope this makes my
intentions clear, Kelly.

1:09:37.073 --> 1:09:38.975
- You're uglier
without the mask.

1:09:40.377 --> 1:09:42.412
- And you're a little
raw without your filters.

1:09:46.015 --> 1:09:47.851
- Fuck you.

1:09:47.851 --> 1:09:49.519
- So that's it?

1:09:49.519 --> 1:09:51.721
You're just going to bust
me up for your followers,

1:09:51.721 --> 1:09:52.689
that's the plan?

1:09:52.689 --> 1:09:53.523
- Yeah.

1:09:55.992 --> 1:09:58.595
- And that's the most
important thing to you?

1:09:58.595 --> 1:10:00.897
Virtual vengeance
for your masses?

1:10:00.897 --> 1:10:02.366
- Oh yeah, it is.

1:10:02.366 --> 1:10:05.269
And just for you, I'll make
sure it goes viral too.

1:10:05.269 --> 1:10:08.238
- Then you haven't
learned a goddamn thing.

1:10:09.739 --> 1:10:11.741
- I forgot that I needed
to learn something.

1:10:11.741 --> 1:10:13.510
What is it called?

1:10:13.510 --> 1:10:14.878
Thesis ship?

1:10:15.812 --> 1:10:16.746
- Theseus.

1:10:18.181 --> 1:10:20.884
- What happened here, you
really think it changed me?

1:10:20.884 --> 1:10:21.918
You really think that?

1:10:21.918 --> 1:10:22.919
- No, no.

1:10:22.919 --> 1:10:24.388
I don't think that at all.

1:10:24.388 --> 1:10:27.857
They didn't change you,
you've been there all along,

1:10:27.857 --> 1:10:31.361
I just swept away a couple
of things, discarded things.

1:10:31.361 --> 1:10:34.063
But that bitch inside
that killer instinct,

1:10:34.063 --> 1:10:35.565
I just brought her out.

1:10:35.565 --> 1:10:38.134
But that was always
there, Kelly.

1:10:38.134 --> 1:10:39.102
Just hidden away.

1:10:43.072 --> 1:10:46.576
You know, the funny thing
about Theseus' ship,

1:10:46.576 --> 1:10:48.445
it isn't just about
the bits that changed,

1:10:48.445 --> 1:10:51.114
the discarded things
that happened to you.

1:10:51.114 --> 1:10:53.116
- Oh no?
- No.

1:10:53.116 --> 1:10:56.786
It was about what if I
could collect all the pieces

1:10:56.786 --> 1:11:00.223
that have been discarded, all
the changes that had been made

1:11:00.223 --> 1:11:03.092
and make a whole new
ship; a whole new Kelly.

1:11:04.628 --> 1:11:06.596
Imagine I could do that.

1:11:06.596 --> 1:11:08.398
Would you recognize each other?

1:11:08.398 --> 1:11:12.536
More importantly, Kelly, would
you be afraid of each other?

1:11:12.536 --> 1:11:15.605
Would one Kelly fear what
the other Kelly had become?

1:11:18.174 --> 1:11:19.476
- And whose fault is that?

1:11:20.377 --> 1:11:21.778
- Why, social media's.

1:11:23.212 --> 1:11:25.849
- Social media didn't kill
Sabrina and suffocated Jill.

1:11:25.849 --> 1:11:30.119
- Oh my god, you are still
defending social media.

1:11:30.119 --> 1:11:31.388
Haven't you learned anything?

1:11:31.388 --> 1:11:33.757
This is why you were
rotten to your core.

1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:37.561
- I don't know.

1:11:37.561 --> 1:11:39.329
Is social media
worse than a murder?

1:11:39.329 --> 1:11:41.431
Actually, no, don't answer.

1:11:41.431 --> 1:11:42.632
Keep that for court.

1:11:44.334 --> 1:11:46.302
Even if you kill
me, they find you!

1:11:46.302 --> 1:11:48.271
- I hope so!

1:11:48.271 --> 1:11:51.240
I hope so, you fucking idiot!

1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:52.709
- You do?
- Yeah!

1:11:52.709 --> 1:11:55.812
Your trial would be the
trial of the century.

1:11:57.814 --> 1:11:59.449
- Oh.

1:11:59.449 --> 1:12:01.951
You're the one that
wants to be famous now?

1:12:01.951 --> 1:12:03.520
- Fame?

1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:05.021
You think I want to be famous?

1:12:06.222 --> 1:12:08.124
You think that's why
I'm doing all this?

1:12:08.124 --> 1:12:08.992
Don't you get it?

1:12:10.026 --> 1:12:10.860
Imagine it;

1:12:12.228 --> 1:12:15.499
I get put on trial for murdering
you through social media.

1:12:15.499 --> 1:12:19.002
Some prosecutor is adept enough
to prove that social media

1:12:19.002 --> 1:12:22.939
is dangerous in anybody's
hands; my hands, your hands,

1:12:22.939 --> 1:12:25.709
but more importantly,
children's hands.

1:12:25.709 --> 1:12:26.910
Look what it can do to them.

1:12:26.910 --> 1:12:29.078
Imagine they prove that.
Imagine I'm guilty.

1:12:30.213 --> 1:12:32.649
Well, the ramifications
are pretty exciting.

1:12:32.649 --> 1:12:35.952
Parents start to see what
I've been seeing all along.

1:12:36.886 --> 1:12:37.821
This isn't right.

1:12:39.222 --> 1:12:42.158
These social media giants,
they shouldn't be doing this.

1:12:42.158 --> 1:12:43.593
They're unchecked.

1:12:43.593 --> 1:12:46.029
They have no moral code.

1:12:46.029 --> 1:12:47.230
They're raising our young.

1:12:47.230 --> 1:12:50.199
They're the hand the
rocks the cradle, Kelly!

1:12:51.468 --> 1:12:52.602
And we're letting them.

1:12:54.003 --> 1:12:56.873
They're giving one sided
trial by social media stories.

1:12:56.873 --> 1:12:59.476
They're over sexualizing
children before they've had

1:12:59.476 --> 1:13:00.710
their first kiss.

1:13:00.710 --> 1:13:01.778
Worse still, you know
what they're doing?

1:13:01.778 --> 1:13:04.481
They're allowing cyber bullying

1:13:04.481 --> 1:13:08.184
so that some cunt like you
can tell a six year old girl

1:13:08.184 --> 1:13:10.219
that she isn't pretty
enough to be like her,

1:13:10.219 --> 1:13:12.589
because even if she's
spent a million years

1:13:12.589 --> 1:13:16.125
editing all her photos,
she will never be you.

1:13:16.125 --> 1:13:18.094
So don't message
me again, bitch!

1:13:18.094 --> 1:13:21.431
Sorry, did I get all
of that quote right?

1:13:21.431 --> 1:13:22.932
Was that what you said to her?

1:13:25.401 --> 1:13:27.203
And the next day
she killed herself.

1:13:29.172 --> 1:13:30.306
Did you know that?

1:13:33.777 --> 1:13:35.344
- I don't know what
you talking about?

1:13:35.344 --> 1:13:36.179
- No.

1:13:37.947 --> 1:13:39.616
Don't lie to me.

1:13:39.616 --> 1:13:41.317
I despise lies.

1:13:41.317 --> 1:13:42.786
Don't lie.

1:13:42.786 --> 1:13:45.989
- Everyone knows that
social media is bullshit.

1:13:45.989 --> 1:13:48.357
Everyone knows that.
- Not Children!

1:13:48.357 --> 1:13:49.926
Children don't know, Kelly.

1:13:51.060 --> 1:13:53.129
Children aren't suspicious.

1:13:53.129 --> 1:13:56.032
And I want to live in a world
where they don't have to be.

1:13:57.233 --> 1:13:58.835
I just want them to be children.

1:14:01.304 --> 1:14:02.138
- Look,

1:14:03.673 --> 1:14:05.942
if I really did
what you just said,

1:14:07.310 --> 1:14:09.946
which does sound like me,

1:14:11.414 --> 1:14:12.882
at least the old me,

1:14:14.484 --> 1:14:16.019
then just kill me, please.

1:14:17.453 --> 1:14:18.555
Just get it over with.

1:14:19.856 --> 1:14:20.690
- No.

1:14:22.091 --> 1:14:26.696
No, Kelly, because I need
you for one last job.

1:14:28.097 --> 1:14:31.568
I need a star, Kelly, a star.

1:14:31.568 --> 1:14:33.870
Someone that can appeal to
the masses cause no one gives

1:14:33.870 --> 1:14:36.840
a shit about a little
six year old girl.

1:14:38.041 --> 1:14:39.976
But killer social
media influencer,

1:14:41.177 --> 1:14:43.279
and the whole place
is going to go nuts.

1:14:43.279 --> 1:14:46.115
So I need your star power.

1:14:46.115 --> 1:14:48.451
So tell me the only thing
I want to know right now,

1:14:48.451 --> 1:14:49.886
one more question;

1:14:51.287 --> 1:14:52.822
are you ready for your closeup?

1:14:56.059 --> 1:14:56.893
Are you ready?

1:14:57.794 --> 1:14:59.428
- I'm not doing this, no.

1:14:59.428 --> 1:15:00.797
- Don't say it.
- No.

1:15:00.797 --> 1:15:02.298
- Don't say it.
- No, I'm not doing this.

1:15:02.298 --> 1:15:04.233
- Don't say it, don't
say it, don't say it.

1:15:04.233 --> 1:15:05.602
Don't say it.

1:15:05.602 --> 1:15:06.636
Don't say it.

1:15:09.005 --> 1:15:11.174
- You can't take
anything from me anymore.

1:15:11.174 --> 1:15:12.408
You took everything.

1:15:15.444 --> 1:15:16.445
- No, Kelly.

1:15:17.413 --> 1:15:18.915
No, Kelly.

1:15:18.915 --> 1:15:21.585
I'm the one with
nothing to lose.

1:15:21.585 --> 1:15:23.152
I've got nothing left.

1:15:23.152 --> 1:15:25.855
I don't have the six
year old anymore.

1:15:25.855 --> 1:15:28.024
So you don't want to
be in a fight with me.

1:15:31.728 --> 1:15:34.430
You, you're young,
you've got a family.

1:15:34.430 --> 1:15:36.866
You've plenty of
chips on the table

1:15:36.866 --> 1:15:39.969
and you are forcing
me to hurt them.

1:15:41.204 --> 1:15:42.438
- I'm not doing it.

1:15:47.744 --> 1:15:48.845
- Really, Kelly?

1:15:50.847 --> 1:15:53.016
I swore I was going
to have to use this.

1:15:54.918 --> 1:15:57.120
Would you look at that?

1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:59.589
My, my.

1:15:59.589 --> 1:16:01.190
What a beautiful little girl.

1:16:02.759 --> 1:16:05.161
I bet she wants to be
just like her big sister.

1:16:08.197 --> 1:16:10.066
You know, I heard she
recently got her first

1:16:10.066 --> 1:16:11.367
social media account.

1:16:12.535 --> 1:16:13.369
What a milestone.

1:16:14.638 --> 1:16:17.406
- Don't fucking touch my
sister, I swear to God.

1:16:17.406 --> 1:16:19.743
- Oh, I haven't yet.

1:16:21.110 --> 1:16:21.945
But I might.

1:16:23.379 --> 1:16:26.082
- If you touch one hair of her
I will make sure to find you

1:16:26.082 --> 1:16:27.651
and fucking kill you.

1:16:27.651 --> 1:16:28.785
You don't touch her.

1:16:30.253 --> 1:16:32.021
- I bet she wants
to be just like you.

1:16:32.021 --> 1:16:35.191
400,000 friends,
virtual of course,

1:16:35.191 --> 1:16:36.793
none that can actually help her.

1:16:38.862 --> 1:16:41.397
I wonder how easy
it'll be to get to her.

1:16:41.397 --> 1:16:42.565
I know where you live.

1:16:43.767 --> 1:16:45.835
Her bedroom's second
door on the left, right?

1:16:45.835 --> 1:16:47.536
- Promise me you
won't touch her.

1:16:49.639 --> 1:16:50.940
- What's my promise worth?

1:16:52.275 --> 1:16:54.343
- Because you said
you'd never lie to me.

1:16:56.079 --> 1:16:57.480
- And I never have.

1:16:58.648 --> 1:17:01.050
- Then promise me
you won't touch her.

1:17:01.050 --> 1:17:02.385
- Are you going to play my game?

1:17:05.655 --> 1:17:08.291
Second door on the left.
Upstairs is her bedroom.

1:17:08.291 --> 1:17:09.926
She's got a pink unicorn
in there, hasn't she?

1:17:09.926 --> 1:17:10.927
- Okay, stop it.

1:17:12.561 --> 1:17:13.396
I'll do it.

1:17:15.498 --> 1:17:16.700
- You'll play my game?

1:17:16.700 --> 1:17:17.801
- I'll play your game.

1:17:22.839 --> 1:17:26.175
- Well, all right,
then I promise you,
she won't be touched.

1:17:27.643 --> 1:17:29.679
Are you going to mention
me in the live stream?

1:17:31.815 --> 1:17:34.517
- Well, isn't that
what you want?

1:17:34.517 --> 1:17:35.351
- No.

1:17:36.219 --> 1:17:38.087
No, this isn't about what I want

1:17:38.087 --> 1:17:40.189
and it won't affect the
promise I just made to you

1:17:40.189 --> 1:17:43.827
for your sister; this is
about what Kelly's going to do

1:17:43.827 --> 1:17:45.895
with the last two
minutes of her life.

1:17:47.330 --> 1:17:48.965
You're lucky.

1:17:48.965 --> 1:17:51.801
How many people get to know
that it's the last two minutes

1:17:51.801 --> 1:17:53.202
of their life, it just
creeps up on them,

1:17:53.202 --> 1:17:55.471
but you will be
dead in two minutes.

1:17:57.573 --> 1:17:58.407
Are you ready?

1:18:00.143 --> 1:18:00.944
- Okay.

1:18:02.746 --> 1:18:04.714
I know what I want to say.

1:18:04.714 --> 1:18:06.649
- It's just one minute.

1:18:09.485 --> 1:18:10.920
[sirens whirring]
- Oh my god.

1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:12.756
Oh my god! Help me in here!

1:18:12.756 --> 1:18:13.957
Help me!

1:18:13.957 --> 1:18:16.025
I'm in here, please!

1:18:16.025 --> 1:18:17.393
Please!

1:18:17.393 --> 1:18:18.227
Please!

1:18:20.196 --> 1:18:23.266
Help me, help me, help me!

1:18:26.702 --> 1:18:28.972
[Charles laughing]

1:18:28.972 --> 1:18:31.640
- I'm sorry, that was cruel,
but it was fun to watch.

1:18:34.710 --> 1:18:37.080
There's no one coming, Kelly.

1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:39.215
No police are
anywhere near here.

1:18:40.183 --> 1:18:42.151
God, it's just a light gag.

1:18:42.151 --> 1:18:44.687
I can turn it off and
on anytime I want.

1:18:44.687 --> 1:18:47.323
But there's no one coming.

1:18:48.524 --> 1:18:49.458
I set that up.

1:18:50.593 --> 1:18:52.161
It was a little bit
of hope for you.

1:18:53.029 --> 1:18:53.963
But it's all just make believe.

1:18:53.963 --> 1:18:54.798
Look, watch.

1:18:56.465 --> 1:18:57.466
[sirens whirring]
There we go.

1:18:57.466 --> 1:18:58.802
Hear the sirens?

1:19:00.937 --> 1:19:02.105
And watch them go away.

1:19:07.043 --> 1:19:10.746
Oh, you think they're
looking for you, don't you?

1:19:10.746 --> 1:19:13.116
The firework, that was me.

1:19:13.116 --> 1:19:15.151
I've been Detective
Langley this whole time

1:19:15.151 --> 1:19:17.253
with a voice changer,
of course, but

1:19:17.253 --> 1:19:18.554
you're just talking to me.

1:19:23.526 --> 1:19:24.994
Oh no.

1:19:24.994 --> 1:19:27.196
I just took away the last
bit of hope, didn't I?

1:19:28.397 --> 1:19:30.666
You were holding onto
that thread that maybe

1:19:30.666 --> 1:19:33.369
some white knight in shining
armor is going to come in

1:19:33.369 --> 1:19:34.971
and rescue you at
the last minute.

1:19:37.173 --> 1:19:37.974
He's not.

1:19:39.442 --> 1:19:42.278
All that's left, Kelly, is a
crushing defeat I'm afraid.

1:19:46.115 --> 1:19:46.950
You ready?

1:19:48.151 --> 1:19:49.618
Come on, let's get
you out of these.

1:19:51.754 --> 1:19:52.856
There you go.

1:19:54.123 --> 1:19:54.958
There.

1:20:01.697 --> 1:20:02.966
You look great.

1:20:06.169 --> 1:20:07.403
We're going to be late.

1:20:08.604 --> 1:20:11.908
That's okay, I'm sure
people waited for you.

1:20:11.908 --> 1:20:13.843
And here we go.

1:20:13.843 --> 1:20:17.113
In five, four, three.

1:20:25.688 --> 1:20:27.857
- A lot of you might
think you know me.

1:20:30.026 --> 1:20:31.227
A lot of you might think

1:20:32.428 --> 1:20:34.363
that you know what
my life is like,

1:20:35.899 --> 1:20:37.366
or about, but you don't.

1:20:39.668 --> 1:20:40.703
You don't know me.

1:20:42.771 --> 1:20:44.307
Actually, just a few does.

1:20:46.742 --> 1:20:47.543
My mom,

1:20:50.246 --> 1:20:51.047
my dad,

1:20:52.615 --> 1:20:54.350
my brother and my sister.

1:20:54.350 --> 1:20:55.151
You guys know.

1:20:57.620 --> 1:21:00.156
You're actually the only
one that actually knows me.

1:21:04.393 --> 1:21:06.495
If I could go back in time,

1:21:08.331 --> 1:21:11.100
I would've never
started social media.

1:21:14.403 --> 1:21:15.238
I mean,

1:21:18.241 --> 1:21:20.043
I wish I'd never
have to say goodbye,

1:21:20.043 --> 1:21:21.144
but if I had to,

1:21:23.980 --> 1:21:25.814
I didn't want it to be on here.

1:21:28.151 --> 1:21:29.185
On social media.

1:21:31.354 --> 1:21:32.688
Cause it's the most

1:21:34.123 --> 1:21:37.726
entire social thing ever
and such a waste of time.

1:21:43.967 --> 1:21:44.867
But to you,

1:21:46.936 --> 1:21:48.938
my family, I love you.

1:21:48.938 --> 1:21:51.640
And Lily, listen to me, baby,

1:21:52.841 --> 1:21:54.110
I don't want you
to do this, okay?

1:21:54.110 --> 1:21:56.579
I want you to live
a proper life.

1:21:56.579 --> 1:21:57.580
A real life.

1:21:59.015 --> 1:22:00.116
Not a virtual one.

1:22:02.285 --> 1:22:04.020
And to all my followers;

1:22:05.354 --> 1:22:07.690
you don't know me, okay?

1:22:07.690 --> 1:22:10.359
You don't know me.
You never knew me.

1:22:10.359 --> 1:22:11.594
We're not friends.

1:22:13.096 --> 1:22:14.363
We're not friends.

1:22:14.363 --> 1:22:15.898
You don't know me until
you got a drink with me

1:22:15.898 --> 1:22:17.967
or you don't know me if you
don't know my brother name,

1:22:17.967 --> 1:22:19.668
we don't know each other.

1:22:21.470 --> 1:22:24.273
It takes flesh and blood
for connections like that.

1:22:31.814 --> 1:22:34.717
And it's taken me to get to
the last two minutes of my life

1:22:34.717 --> 1:22:36.019
to realize that.

1:22:38.554 --> 1:22:40.089
And I would do anything

1:22:42.191 --> 1:22:45.061
to have those two last
minutes with my family.

1:22:45.061 --> 1:22:46.395
- [Charles] All right,
let's leave it there.

1:22:46.395 --> 1:22:47.863
- Please, let call
my baby sister.

1:22:47.863 --> 1:22:50.666
I just want to talk to
her one last time, please.

1:22:50.666 --> 1:22:52.668
I'm begging you, please.

1:22:52.668 --> 1:22:55.904
[Kelly crying]
Please.

1:22:58.374 --> 1:22:59.908
- It's over, Kelly.

1:23:01.377 --> 1:23:03.279
It's just time for
the inevitable now.

1:23:07.016 --> 1:23:07.850
Okay?

1:23:15.458 --> 1:23:18.727
I'm very proud of the
breakthrough you just made.

1:23:18.727 --> 1:23:20.129
Well done, Kelly.

1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:26.669
- He's not going to kill you.

1:23:26.669 --> 1:23:27.636
- He never was.

1:23:35.511 --> 1:23:36.679
- What's happening?

1:23:39.682 --> 1:23:41.384
- He wanted to kill the old you.

1:23:41.384 --> 1:23:42.851
The fake you.

1:23:46.155 --> 1:23:46.989
- What?

1:23:52.561 --> 1:23:54.863
- What do we always
say about social media?

1:23:57.032 --> 1:24:00.035
- That nothing you
see is real, right?

1:24:00.035 --> 1:24:03.572
[Sabrina screaming]

1:24:03.572 --> 1:24:04.973
[gun bangs]

1:24:08.977 --> 1:24:11.714
[Jill groaning]

1:24:15.218 --> 1:24:16.119
- It's sad.

1:24:18.287 --> 1:24:19.955
Nobody even knows
you're missing.

1:24:21.157 --> 1:24:23.292
We've been texting your
friends and family.

1:24:24.427 --> 1:24:26.729
You never spend time with them.

1:24:26.729 --> 1:24:27.596
Call them.

1:24:30.133 --> 1:24:32.668
And you've been posting.

1:24:37.072 --> 1:24:39.508
Nobody even knows
you've been kidnapped.

1:24:39.508 --> 1:24:41.410
- Is that really how
you want to live?

1:24:43.045 --> 1:24:47.116
Someone as popular as you, yet
invisible to the naked eye.

1:24:50.085 --> 1:24:53.789
- And he did that for-

1:24:53.789 --> 1:24:56.091
- For you, Kelly.

1:24:56.091 --> 1:24:58.394
This has all been for you.

1:24:59.862 --> 1:25:01.597
And you made a
miraculous breakthrough.

1:25:01.597 --> 1:25:04.400
You said it yourself;
this is all bullshit.

1:25:06.469 --> 1:25:08.504
All those friends,
those virtual friends,

1:25:09.372 --> 1:25:10.739
what were you doing it for?

1:25:12.107 --> 1:25:13.276
They couldn't help you.

1:25:15.678 --> 1:25:18.614
Kelly, this is your chance.

1:25:18.614 --> 1:25:20.115
Help us.

1:25:20.115 --> 1:25:21.717
We want to collaborate with you.

1:25:25.654 --> 1:25:26.555
Join us.

1:25:27.990 --> 1:25:31.026
Help reeducate the world and
what they should be doing

1:25:31.026 --> 1:25:31.960
with their time.

1:25:33.362 --> 1:25:36.599
I'm building an army of
social media de-influencers

1:25:36.599 --> 1:25:40.068
and I want you by my side.

1:25:40.068 --> 1:25:42.638
It's your second chance, Kelly.

1:25:42.638 --> 1:25:47.643
You don't have to take it,
but I really hope you do.

1:25:51.714 --> 1:25:53.982
- This can't be real.
This is not happening.

1:25:53.982 --> 1:25:56.385
This is not happening.

1:25:56.385 --> 1:25:57.553
- This is real, Kelly.

1:25:57.553 --> 1:26:00.189
Everything that's
happening here is real.

1:26:00.189 --> 1:26:03.058
Everything you did
before now wasn't.

1:26:06.862 --> 1:26:08.497
- It's all right.

1:26:08.497 --> 1:26:09.732
It's all right.

1:26:13.001 --> 1:26:16.705
9-1-1 I need a police car
and an ambulance, I guess.

1:26:16.705 --> 1:26:21.009
I found a young girl passed
out in a factory floor.

1:26:21.009 --> 1:26:21.844
Please hurry.

1:26:25.113 --> 1:26:25.948
- Hey.

1:26:26.882 --> 1:26:27.716
Hey.

1:26:29.385 --> 1:26:31.787
Hey, hey, you're okay,
you're fine, you're safe.

1:26:31.787 --> 1:26:32.688
What's your name?

1:26:35.758 --> 1:26:36.959
- Are they gone?

1:26:36.959 --> 1:26:37.793
- Who?

1:26:41.430 --> 1:26:42.898
- I want to talk to my family.

1:26:42.898 --> 1:26:44.700
- Just a minute.
What's your name?

1:26:46.435 --> 1:26:47.403
- Kelly.

1:26:47.403 --> 1:26:48.671
- Okay. Are you hurt?

1:26:50.673 --> 1:26:51.507
- No.

1:26:52.808 --> 1:26:56.111
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
they took my kidney.

1:26:56.111 --> 1:26:57.446
- Okay, let me take a look.

1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:07.290
- No, you're okay. No
one took your kidney.

1:27:09.224 --> 1:27:11.159
- But there's a
bandage and blood and-

1:27:11.159 --> 1:27:12.595
- Yeah, it's just a scratch.

1:27:15.431 --> 1:27:17.232
Have you taken any
drugs or alcohol?

1:27:19.468 --> 1:27:20.303
- And my toe.

1:27:23.205 --> 1:27:25.608
- Yes, I can see that.
May we take a look?

1:27:29.678 --> 1:27:33.015
- Ma'am, ma'am, did
someone attack you?

1:27:37.085 --> 1:27:38.253
- What?

1:27:38.253 --> 1:27:39.688
- Did someone do this to you?

1:27:40.823 --> 1:27:42.891
We need to know if
there was a crime here.

1:27:42.891 --> 1:27:43.692
We'll find them.

1:27:46.128 --> 1:27:47.430
- No.

1:27:47.430 --> 1:27:48.397
No crime committed.

1:27:49.365 --> 1:27:50.599
- Look, you can trust us.

1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:53.135
- I'm okay.

1:27:57.306 --> 1:27:58.807
- You're an influencer, right?

1:28:01.710 --> 1:28:02.945
- What?

1:28:02.945 --> 1:28:06.582
- I want you to think of
me as a de-influencer.

1:28:06.582 --> 1:28:07.483
Good luck, ladies.

1:28:10.619 --> 1:28:11.887
You are going to need it.

1:28:23.265 --> 1:28:24.933
Hey, hey, wake up.

1:28:24.933 --> 1:28:26.569
Come on.

1:28:26.569 --> 1:28:27.603
We're going to get
out of this, okay?

1:28:27.603 --> 1:28:28.771
- What's happening?

1:28:29.772 --> 1:28:30.606
- We were kidnapped.

1:28:30.606 --> 1:28:31.474
Do you remember?

1:28:33.676 --> 1:28:36.645
He told me I needed to help
you to get out of this prison.

1:28:36.645 --> 1:28:39.081
- It's okay, we're going
to escape together, okay?

1:28:39.081 --> 1:28:40.683
I'm going to get us out of here.

1:28:42.317 --> 1:28:43.185
Okay.

1:28:43.185 --> 1:28:44.353
Almost there, okay?

1:28:49.758 --> 1:28:53.829
