interesting way to be able to

43:48.147 --> 43:50.018
get into the interior life
of Claudia.

43:50.149 --> 43:52.325
That was the quickest, easiest,
dirtiest way.

43:52.455 --> 43:55.894
Claudia:
I closed my eyes and waited for
the fire to take me too.

43:56.024 --> 43:58.897
That's when
the Black angel came.

43:59.027 --> 44:01.073
I think the room
was very, very excited

44:01.203 --> 44:02.944
to try to switch point of views

44:03.075 --> 44:06.034
and really be the story of the
young girl and let her own it,

44:06.165 --> 44:08.950
so the voice-over changes,
and the perspective changes.

44:09.081 --> 44:11.257
All these half-hour comedies
have a great way of doing it.

44:11.387 --> 44:13.259
They have these fake
documentaries where they can

44:13.389 --> 44:15.522
turn to the camera and tell you
exactly how you're feeling.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.480
That's our equivalent here.

44:17.611 --> 44:19.134
And then I tasted it,

44:19.265 --> 44:22.616
and right away I felt strong
as a streetcar.

44:22.747 --> 44:24.270
[Gasping]

44:24.400 --> 44:26.794
Enough!

44:26.925 --> 44:28.361
I think she's just trying to
figure it out.

44:28.491 --> 44:31.190
"I can leap and I can kill
and I got power."

44:31.320 --> 44:33.583
No! Don't!

44:33.714 --> 44:35.977
Jones: In the novel,
she is without a doubt

44:36.108 --> 44:38.414
the most vampire
out of both of them.

44:38.545 --> 44:40.155
She's a pretty dark killer.

44:40.286 --> 44:42.854
What would it be like to be
trapped in the chemical stew

44:42.984 --> 44:45.857
of puberty
for your entire existence?

44:45.987 --> 44:47.510
Must every night
end like this?

44:47.641 --> 44:49.338
Y'all get tired
'fore I do.

44:49.469 --> 44:51.166
Why does she talk
to the book?

44:51.297 --> 44:52.994
"I got desires,
and I'm a little out of control,

44:53.125 --> 44:55.388
and I love
writing in my journal."

44:55.518 --> 44:58.130
In our Claudia, I think there's
something precocious about her,

44:58.260 --> 45:00.436
but there's also something
that has been sheltered.

45:00.567 --> 45:03.091
There is a lack of wisdom
and world experience

45:03.222 --> 45:06.181
that goes there that makes it
a very toxic and volcanic

45:06.312 --> 45:09.184
and potentially explosive little
suitcase bomb of a vampire.

45:09.315 --> 45:10.751
You gonna stand there watching,
little girl?

45:11.883 --> 45:13.406
[Screams]

45:13.536 --> 45:16.801
We are looking at the portrait
of the troubled teen.

45:16.931 --> 45:19.629
The idea of a sexual awakening
in the midst of this,

45:19.760 --> 45:22.110
unfortunately, in the confines
of our story,

45:22.241 --> 45:24.547
your first date
becomes your first homicide.

45:24.678 --> 45:25.810
Here comes Charlie.

45:25.940 --> 45:27.681
Think about your first love,
everybody.

45:27.812 --> 45:29.204
And then you ate
that person.

45:29.335 --> 45:30.771
You're an angel.

45:32.730 --> 45:33.948
It's pretty -- pretty rough.

45:36.081 --> 45:37.604
Charlie?

45:37.735 --> 45:40.912
Yeah, that would screw you up
going forward a little bit.

45:41.042 --> 45:42.914
She cannot process
what has happened,

45:43.044 --> 45:44.480
and, like any teen,

45:44.611 --> 45:49.355
just grabs onto all of the grand
operatic drama of it all.

45:49.485 --> 45:50.617
Turn him.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.924
I can't.

45:53.054 --> 45:54.403
You can't?

45:54.534 --> 45:56.231
She's about to act out
like every teen gone wild,

45:56.362 --> 45:58.451
and is gonna
start by harming herself

45:58.581 --> 46:01.933
in a very particular way
only a young vampire could do.
