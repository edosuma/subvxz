WEBVTT

00:02.063 --> 00:07.033
Okay, boys, we've got a really large
group today, so please stay together.

00:07.034 --> 00:08.568
Oh, Steve, thank goodness.

00:08.570 --> 00:11.071
I need you to help me lead these
kids down The Rock Eagle Trail.

00:11.072 --> 00:13.139
I'm having a hard time
keeping up with them myself.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.008
I wish that I could, but I'm busy.

00:15.009 --> 00:16.042
Doing what?

00:16.043 --> 00:17.777
Updating my status.

00:17.778 --> 00:19.646
"Had a hot dog for lunch.

00:19.647 --> 00:22.416
Any spicy mustard fans out there?"

00:22.417 --> 00:25.057
Uh... Lucas, no!

00:25.420 --> 00:27.787
Stay with the group.

00:27.788 --> 00:30.224
Come on, Steve, I really
need some help here.

00:30.225 --> 00:31.658
This light is perfect.

00:31.659 --> 00:33.594
And, I need a new profile photo.

00:33.595 --> 00:34.628
Here, take it for me.

00:34.629 --> 00:36.849
[Rattling]

00:37.565 --> 00:38.573
[Exhales heavily]

00:38.574 --> 00:40.267
Please stay with the group.

00:40.268 --> 00:41.152
[Camera clicks]

00:41.153 --> 00:42.603
Loving my hair today.

00:42.604 --> 00:45.805
Ugh. Steve, do you ever think
about anybody but yourself?

00:45.806 --> 00:48.074
You are the most self-centered
man on the planet.

00:48.075 --> 00:51.811
Go on. What else about Steve
do you find fascinating?

00:51.812 --> 00:54.615
Ugh. Not only do I not
find you fascinating,

00:54.616 --> 00:57.016
but I doubt there is a single
woman alive that would.

00:57.017 --> 01:01.388
For your information, Denzel and I
are doing speed dating tonight.

01:01.389 --> 01:04.090
- I bet I'll score.
- There is no way that you're...

01:04.090 --> 01:05.191
Oh, God!

01:05.191 --> 01:07.994
Come on, kids. Up into the ferris wheel.

01:07.995 --> 01:10.398
There's room for everybody.

01:10.399 --> 01:14.100
Hey! It happened to me, and
I turned out all right.

01:14.101 --> 01:15.201
[Honks bicycle horn]

01:15.202 --> 01:17.722
[Jaunty music]

01:18.876 --> 01:19.873
[Screams]

01:19.874 --> 01:25.397
<i>Brickleberry...</i>

01:26.648 --> 01:29.750
So the North Koreans grabbed me,
and smuggled me across the border.

01:29.751 --> 01:31.885
I had to spend nine months
in a hard labor camp,

01:31.886 --> 01:33.587
while former President
Carter negotiated my...

01:33.588 --> 01:34.621
I'm sorry, did you say something?

01:34.622 --> 01:37.291
I was just making a list of people
who could play me in a movie.

01:41.862 --> 01:43.563
So...

01:43.564 --> 01:46.266
Are we gonna get it on, or what?

01:46.267 --> 01:48.635
[Whispering] Denzel.
What's with these women?

01:48.636 --> 01:51.171
Man, you the problem.
You don't listen to 'em.

01:51.172 --> 01:54.073
Now, you know me.
I like my women like spoiled milk...

01:54.074 --> 01:55.875
White, and past the expiration date.

01:55.876 --> 01:57.210
Watch and learn.

01:57.211 --> 02:00.980
So he calls and he says,
"grandma, I got accepted."

02:00.981 --> 02:03.450
Oh, my goodness, you're
telling me your grandson

02:03.451 --> 02:05.852
got into Tulane on a full scholarship?

02:05.853 --> 02:07.053
Mazel tov.

02:07.054 --> 02:09.889
Now, how about we go back to your place
and knock the dust off that poontang?

02:09.889 --> 02:12.693
Ooh! Thought you'd never ask.

02:12.694 --> 02:14.328
It's just like Shakespeare said...

02:14.329 --> 02:16.930
"If you yak about you,
your sack will turn blue.

02:16.931 --> 02:19.833
But if you watch and listen,
her crotch will glisten."

02:19.834 --> 02:22.092
- William Shakespeare said that?
- Who?

02:22.093 --> 02:23.888
Nah. My boy Jamarcus Shakespeare.

02:23.889 --> 02:25.205
Ran a chop shop in Detroit.

02:25.206 --> 02:28.775
Brother pulled more hos
than a Fire Department.

02:28.776 --> 02:31.177
Ethel and Denzel don't know
what they're talking about.

02:31.178 --> 02:33.714
I'm not self-centered. Am I?

02:33.715 --> 02:35.782
No. Don't even say that.

02:35.783 --> 02:37.114
You're amazing!

02:37.115 --> 02:41.187
Thank you. Finally, someone who
makes a little sense around here.

02:41.188 --> 02:43.790
I appreciate how amazing you are.

02:43.791 --> 02:47.293
Why don't you tell me everything
there is to know about you?

02:47.294 --> 02:49.763
Me? My favorite subject.

02:49.764 --> 02:54.874
My earliest memory was being the
fastest sperm in the balls.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.604
Mmm. Nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum.

02:57.605 --> 02:59.673
Mmm, nyum, yum, yum, yum.

02:59.674 --> 03:01.742
Well, if it ain't the house bear.

03:01.743 --> 03:03.844
Where you going, you spoiled little pussy?

03:03.845 --> 03:05.379
Inside, where I live.

03:05.380 --> 03:07.591
You guys have fun digging
through the garbage, though.

03:07.592 --> 03:10.350
Ooh, I forgot, we put rocks on the lids.
Tough break, guys.

03:10.351 --> 03:13.620
- Yo, gimme those.
- Hey, those are mine!

03:13.621 --> 03:15.841
[Grunting]

03:15.890 --> 03:17.524
Okay, okay, you win.

03:17.525 --> 03:18.658
Tell you what.

03:18.659 --> 03:23.196
I'll bring you some food from
inside, just wait right here.

03:23.197 --> 03:25.499
Malloy, what are you doing?

03:25.500 --> 03:26.736
Getting a gun.

03:26.737 --> 03:28.952
What have I told you about guns?

03:28.953 --> 03:31.671
To scratch the serial number
off before you murder someone.

03:31.672 --> 03:32.734
No.

03:32.735 --> 03:35.963
Only rangers can carry guns
inside of a National Park.

03:35.964 --> 03:37.258
That rule sucks.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.401
I just need to command a
little respect around here.

03:40.402 --> 03:42.982
Trust me, I don't need
a gun to get respect.

03:42.983 --> 03:44.512
What's up, you fat old mother...

03:44.513 --> 03:46.018
Handsome, strong...

03:46.019 --> 03:47.768
Stupid, ignorant-ass...

03:47.769 --> 03:49.002
All-around nice guy.

03:49.003 --> 03:52.505
All right, maybe you've got a point.

03:52.506 --> 03:54.575
So then, we get to her place
and start going at it.

03:54.576 --> 03:56.643
Everything is getting hot and heavy.

03:56.644 --> 03:59.505
She smells like menthol
rubs and female excitement,

03:59.506 --> 04:01.915
when all of a sudden the parlor door opens.

04:01.916 --> 04:03.784
- [Exasperated] Mom...
- You got a mom?

04:03.785 --> 04:06.787
You go to your room at once, young lady!

04:06.788 --> 04:09.422
Cock blocked by a 90-year-old.
Ain't that some shit?

04:09.423 --> 04:11.524
I am really sorry I asked about that.

04:11.525 --> 04:12.564
[Laughs triumphantly]

04:12.565 --> 04:13.580
Yeah!

04:13.581 --> 04:16.196
I will have you know that
my self-centered ass

04:16.197 --> 04:21.067
just scored with the hottest,
sexiest woman in the whole world!

04:21.069 --> 04:22.170
I don't believe it.

04:22.171 --> 04:24.304
And, she only wanted to talk about me.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.573
She didn't waste my time talking about her.

04:26.574 --> 04:29.442
Oh, yeah, and we had the
wildest sex you could imagine.

04:29.443 --> 04:33.647
It wasn't until it was all over that she
finally asked for something for herself.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.949
- What was that?
- Five hundred dollars.

04:35.950 --> 04:37.450
I'm assuming it was for cab fare.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.886
And I'm assuming the cab had to
take her to a different state.

04:39.887 --> 04:41.187
I'm assuming, Mexico.

04:41.188 --> 04:43.570
Steve, I think that woman was a...

04:43.571 --> 04:44.658
How should I put this?

04:44.659 --> 04:45.926
That bitch was a ho!

04:45.927 --> 04:48.095
Don't talk about Lady Tanqueray like that!

04:48.096 --> 04:53.690
Besides, if she was a prostitute,
why didn't I wear a condom?

04:53.691 --> 04:55.671
Right?

04:56.870 --> 05:00.841
Steve, how many times have I warned you
about taking part in high-risk behaviors?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.042
Oh, my God.

05:02.043 --> 05:03.910
Someone just left this laying here?

05:03.911 --> 05:06.713
Well, it is cold and flu season.

05:06.714 --> 05:08.181
Is that corned beef?

05:08.182 --> 05:10.183
I'll give you three bucks
for a bite of that.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.653
Who wants to become blood brothers?

05:12.654 --> 05:14.554
All of you? Okay!

05:14.555 --> 05:17.858
Frankly, it's a statistical miracle
that you haven't gotten sick yet...

05:17.859 --> 05:18.892
See?

05:18.893 --> 05:20.557
- Until now.
- What?

05:20.558 --> 05:25.265
Steve, medicine doesn't have words to
describe how horrific your illness is.

05:25.266 --> 05:27.067
I've never seen it before, but...

05:27.068 --> 05:31.350
Well, try to imagine if syphilis did it
with cancer and got full-blown aids.

05:31.351 --> 05:33.577
Can-a-syphil-aids?

05:33.578 --> 05:35.842
Yes, can-a-syphil-aids.

05:35.843 --> 05:37.510
That has a nice ring to it, Steve.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.445
The good news is, you'll
only be sick for two weeks.

05:39.446 --> 05:40.494
Yes!

05:40.495 --> 05:43.784
Because after that you'll be dead.

05:43.785 --> 05:45.719
Oh, my God, Steve.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.420
This is horrible news.

05:47.421 --> 05:50.223
Feels like someone's ripped my
heart straight out of my chest.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.154
Don't worry, Woody. It'll be okay.

05:52.155 --> 05:53.226
No, it won't!

05:53.227 --> 05:57.597
Do you know how much of a hassle it is to
hire a new ranger, you stupid dying idiot?

05:57.598 --> 05:59.132
Malloy, what are you doing?

05:59.133 --> 06:04.171
Just practicing the jig I'm
going to do on Steve's grave.

06:04.172 --> 06:06.506
Can you believe my luck?
That moron's dying.

06:06.507 --> 06:09.142
Now make me the new ranger
and give me my gun.

06:09.143 --> 06:11.244
[Laughs loudly]

06:11.245 --> 06:13.880
A bear ranger? What's next?

06:13.881 --> 06:15.515
Forgiving your dad for making you wear

06:15.516 --> 06:18.585
panties and a padded bra just
because he missed his dead wife?

06:18.586 --> 06:20.120
I'm not mom, dad!

06:20.121 --> 06:22.521
She's gone!

06:30.497 --> 06:32.999
Steve, I can't believe that you're dying.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.568
Yeah, Steve. I'm sad.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.204
Don't be so sad, guys.

06:37.205 --> 06:39.405
In two weeks, I'll be in heaven.

06:39.406 --> 06:41.626
[Laughter]

06:43.814 --> 06:46.079
What? You guys don't think
I'm going to heaven?

06:46.080 --> 06:48.180
Uh, no.

06:50.885 --> 06:56.422
My son, in order to get to heaven you need
to accept Jesus Christ into your heart

06:56.423 --> 06:58.526
as your personal Lord and savior.

06:58.527 --> 07:00.426
Done. I [Bleeping] Love him. What else?

07:00.427 --> 07:02.229
You need to do nice things for people.

07:02.230 --> 07:04.296
On it. I just bought myself an iPad 3

07:04.297 --> 07:06.767
and an all-access pass to a
website called PubeTube...

07:06.768 --> 07:09.502
Steven, I mean good deeds for other people.

07:09.503 --> 07:10.771
Oh.

07:10.772 --> 07:15.075
Uh, hypothetically, what if I've
never helped another person... Ever?

07:15.076 --> 07:18.145
Then you'll burn in hell for all eternity.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.932
I can't spend nine months in hell!

07:19.933 --> 07:21.748
That's maternity, Steven.

07:21.749 --> 07:22.949
Eternity is forever.

07:22.950 --> 07:25.451
Oh, no! You gotta get me out of this!

07:25.452 --> 07:26.486
Please!

07:26.487 --> 07:27.888
There's still time, son.

07:27.889 --> 07:29.689
Just go out there and help others.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.691
Ethel. She does good stuff.

07:31.692 --> 07:33.660
She even started a camp for blind kids.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.295
Good! Do what she does.

07:35.296 --> 07:37.130
Oh, she'll help you get into heaven.

07:37.131 --> 07:40.600
Wait. Wouldn't it be better if I just
followed you around? You're a priest.

07:40.601 --> 07:42.435
Too busy, Steven. I've got this other gig

07:42.436 --> 07:47.356
where I dress as a clown.
[Honks bicycle horn]

07:49.510 --> 07:51.278
I need to ask you something important.

07:51.279 --> 07:53.980
Steve, I told you, the juice
boxes are for the campers.

07:53.981 --> 07:55.849
I wanted to ask for your forgiveness.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.352
I'm sorry for being so self-centered,
and I want to help you do good deeds.

07:59.353 --> 08:03.256
I'm a brand-new Steve, who just
wants to help other people.

08:03.257 --> 08:05.091
Like this one.

08:05.092 --> 08:08.286
You shouldn't be playing with sticks.
You could put your eye out.

08:08.287 --> 08:09.296
[Thud!]

08:09.297 --> 08:11.898
Steve, if you want, you
can read to the kids.

08:11.899 --> 08:14.201
Come on, kids. Story time!

08:14.202 --> 08:15.768
[Telephone rings]

08:15.769 --> 08:16.837
Hello?

08:16.838 --> 08:18.905
Hello, this is Dr. Kuzniak.

08:18.906 --> 08:21.107
I have some very important
information for Steve.

08:21.108 --> 08:22.843
Can you tell him that he's not dying?

08:22.844 --> 08:26.012
It turns out I accidentally mixed up his
blood sample with another patient's.

08:26.013 --> 08:31.913
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the holy... [Gasps, wheezes]

08:36.924 --> 08:40.025
Steve, the doctor called!
He has important news for you!

08:40.027 --> 08:43.796
Page 43. We're into the
lace corset section.

08:43.797 --> 08:47.700
It's the same chick from page 12,
but you can see her jugs better.

08:47.701 --> 08:50.703
Oh, Steve. It's like you've
helped the blind to see.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.339
Now, what was that doctor's big news?

08:52.340 --> 08:56.076
Um... Just that you're still dying.

08:56.077 --> 09:01.977
So I'm supposed to believe that he called
me, just to tell me I'm still dying?

09:03.490 --> 09:04.484
Oh.

09:04.485 --> 09:06.659
Man, that doctor's a [Bleeping] asshole.

09:06.660 --> 09:09.995
Kids, this is the last day
being blind is going to

09:09.996 --> 09:13.298
prevent you from doing anything you want.

09:13.299 --> 09:14.766
Draw...

09:14.767 --> 09:16.867
Release!

09:21.207 --> 09:23.727
How'd we do?

09:24.777 --> 09:27.513
Ethel. I've spent the whole
day showing blind kids

09:27.514 --> 09:30.549
that they can do anything
non-crippled kids can.

09:30.550 --> 09:32.584
That's wonderful, Steve.

09:32.585 --> 09:36.875
Wow. It's amazing how much this
dying thing has changed Steve.

09:36.876 --> 09:40.225
I know, right? He's actually
kind of pleasant to be around.

09:40.226 --> 09:42.961
Which is why I...
Connie, can I tell you something?

09:42.962 --> 09:44.630
Steve isn't really dying.

09:44.631 --> 09:47.599
The doctor called.
It turns out he isn't even sick at all.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.068
That's great news! Let's tell him.

09:50.069 --> 09:52.937
Would it be horrible if
we hold off telling him?

09:52.938 --> 09:55.676
You know, maybe ride the "nice
Steve" wave a little bit longer?

09:55.677 --> 09:58.287
Ethel, that's really selfish of you.

09:58.288 --> 10:01.213
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way,
but it's for the good of the kids.

10:01.214 --> 10:02.082

[Kids cheering]

10:07.769 --> 10:08.995
What's going on in here?

10:08.996 --> 10:10.755
Oh, I'm interviewing for our next ranger.

10:10.756 --> 10:13.659
Just hire me, and let's be done with this.

10:13.660 --> 10:16.928
Daddy's busy, honey.
Why don't you go outside and play?

10:16.929 --> 10:20.165
- No, I'm good.
- Suit yourself. Next!

10:20.166 --> 10:21.509
Good afternoon. Welcome...

10:21.510 --> 10:23.892
Eh! I'm gonna stop you right there.

10:23.893 --> 10:25.837
What's the company policy on angel dust?

10:25.838 --> 10:28.740
It's illegal in the park, and in
these United States of America.

10:28.741 --> 10:31.577
Well, shit! I'm back in the States?
Since when?

10:31.578 --> 10:33.978
Man, you know what can really
make you forget where you are?

10:33.979 --> 10:35.247
Angel dust.

10:35.248 --> 10:37.676
By the way, can you advance me 20
bucks to score some angel dust?

10:37.677 --> 10:39.677
- Next!
- Man, I love angel dust.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.656
- Next!
- I can only ejaculate

10:41.657 --> 10:43.755
- by setting things on fire.
- Next!

10:43.756 --> 10:45.591
- I like lollipops.
- Next!

10:45.592 --> 10:48.026
I want this job because I like animals.

10:48.027 --> 10:49.761
No, I love animals.

10:49.762 --> 10:52.974
Some people say I love animals too
much, you know what I'm saying?

10:52.975 --> 10:53.987
Next!

10:53.988 --> 10:55.634
And, I'm a certified lifeguard.

10:55.635 --> 10:57.236
Well, I'm impressed.

10:57.237 --> 10:58.503
Well, everything looks good.

10:58.504 --> 10:59.804
- He's Canadian.
- What?!

10:59.805 --> 11:02.565
Get out of my office, you disgusting freak!

11:02.566 --> 11:05.644
That is what you get when you
put an ad in a newspaper.

11:05.645 --> 11:07.613
Stupid dying medium.

11:07.614 --> 11:09.914
Malloy, can you help me
post an ad on the Internet

11:09.915 --> 11:12.384
that doesn't attract a
bunch of wacko nut jobs?

11:12.385 --> 11:16.705
Oh, I think I can help you with that.

11:17.257 --> 11:19.391
[Line ringing]

11:19.392 --> 11:21.627
- Hello?
- It's Denzel.

11:21.628 --> 11:24.296
Oh, right. The colored kid.

11:24.297 --> 11:26.498
Oh, well, Myrtle isn't here right now...

11:26.499 --> 11:28.333
Oh, I didn't call to talk to Myrtle.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.168
I called to talk to you, baby.

11:30.169 --> 11:32.170
Oh, I see.

11:32.171 --> 11:35.168
Agnes, I think you fine as hell.
I like mature women.

11:35.169 --> 11:37.409
Myrtle's just too young and naive for me.

11:37.410 --> 11:39.177
Oh, Denzel, stop it.

11:39.178 --> 11:40.746
You're embarrassing me.

11:40.747 --> 11:43.014
So, uh, what are you wearing right now?

11:43.015 --> 11:46.217
A polyester housecoat and gown. Why?

11:46.218 --> 11:47.852
No, I mean under that.

11:47.853 --> 11:51.993
Oh... Well, a brassiere and a girdle.

11:52.024 --> 11:55.624
No, baby. I mean under that.

11:56.929 --> 11:58.029
A diaper.

11:58.030 --> 12:00.910
Now, that's nasty.

12:01.401 --> 12:04.336
Thanks for the best week of my life, Steve.

12:04.337 --> 12:07.473
Don't cry, Frankie.
We'll see each other soon.

12:07.474 --> 12:10.008
Well, I'll see you soon.
Oh, wait. I'll be dead.

12:10.009 --> 12:12.529
[Cries loudly]

12:15.348 --> 12:17.582
Steve, you have been so amazing.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.618
And... Look, I'll be honest.

12:19.619 --> 12:22.454
You always disgusted me.
I found you repulsive.

12:22.455 --> 12:25.256
You know, like when fat people kiss.
But you've changed.

12:25.257 --> 12:27.025
You now seem so...

12:27.026 --> 12:29.461
Sweet and compassionate.

12:29.462 --> 12:30.929
And now that we're alone...

12:30.930 --> 12:35.066
Ethel, as much as I'd love to dip
my diseased donk in your bonk,

12:35.067 --> 12:40.104
I need to find some more good deeds
to do or I'm gonna burn in hell!

12:40.105 --> 12:43.041
Please stop dragging me across the street.

12:43.042 --> 12:44.609
Three more times and I'll let you go.

12:44.610 --> 12:46.911
At least let me use my wheelchair.

12:46.912 --> 12:49.072
No time!

13:06.666 --> 13:08.166
Okay, first things first.

13:08.167 --> 13:12.237
You don't want to hire a child, so
click on the "adults only" section.

13:12.238 --> 13:13.942
"Adults only." Good thinking.

13:13.943 --> 13:16.975
Now we don't need another
female ranger, right?

13:16.976 --> 13:19.310
- Hell, no!
- And you're a man, of course.

13:19.311 --> 13:22.981
So go ahead and click "men seeking men."

13:22.982 --> 13:25.250
Wow, this is easier than I thought.

13:25.251 --> 13:27.419
Hey, Steve. What are you doing?

13:27.420 --> 13:29.413
I'm doing good deeds for the rangers.

13:29.414 --> 13:32.634
The ones I tried to do in town didn't work
out so well, and I'm running out of time.

13:32.635 --> 13:34.618
- Can we talk for a second?
- Not now.

13:34.619 --> 13:37.195
Denzel asked me to swallow these
condoms and drive to Mexico.

13:37.196 --> 13:39.421
But first, I promised Connie a spa day.

13:39.422 --> 13:42.467
Steve! I need another mimosa.

13:42.468 --> 13:46.461
Listen, Connie.
What you said before about telling Steve?

13:46.462 --> 13:49.728
I agree with you now.
It's time I told him the truth.

13:49.729 --> 13:52.444
No way. This is great.

13:52.445 --> 13:54.546
I've never been so pampered in my life.

13:54.547 --> 13:57.181
You are taking advantage of him.
It's not right.

13:57.182 --> 13:58.608
I'm gonna tell him right... Oh!

13:58.609 --> 14:02.749
If you ruin this, I will break you.

14:03.389 --> 14:07.135
Your ad said you need a man who is
willing to submit to your authority?

14:07.136 --> 14:10.435
Yes, Sir. And I'm gonna
work you long and hard.

14:10.436 --> 14:12.631
I'm willing to get down
on my hands and knees

14:12.632 --> 14:14.966
and do whatever it takes to satisfy you.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.830
See, Malloy?
That's what you call commitment.

14:16.831 --> 14:18.192
If you say so.

14:18.193 --> 14:21.454
I want you to shove your fist up
my ass and work me like a puppet.

14:21.455 --> 14:27.355
Well, if that's code for having a good
work ethic, let me go get the paperwork.

14:28.881 --> 14:32.061
Whoa! What the [Bleep]?

14:36.476 --> 14:39.505
So, Steve, I was thinking.
You're about to die a horrible death.

14:39.506 --> 14:44.286
Condolences. Anyhow, I was wondering
if you could do me a small favor.

14:44.287 --> 14:45.630
Sure, I'll help you.

14:45.631 --> 14:48.507
Hear that, God? I'm helping an animal.

14:48.508 --> 14:51.624

wish is for me to have your job.

14:51.625 --> 14:52.792
[Laughs]

14:52.793 --> 14:55.795
God put three types of animals on Earth.

One type to eat, one type
to ride, and whales.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.234
So sayeth the Lord.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.636
Would you stop it with all this God crap?

15:03.637 --> 15:05.251
You blasphemer!

15:05.252 --> 15:08.408
Steve, I know that you're dumb,
but try to listen closely.

15:08.409 --> 15:10.864
- There is no God.
- What?

15:10.865 --> 15:14.663
If there were a God, how do you
explain hunger, suffering, and war?

15:14.664 --> 15:15.868
You know, Africa.

15:15.869 --> 15:18.151
I'll ask God next week when I'm in heaven.

15:18.152 --> 15:22.621
Now if you'll excuse me, I need
to give Connie a Brazilian.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.280
What's the difference?

15:47.281 --> 15:49.551
The difference is you're not dying.

15:49.552 --> 15:51.284
[Sighing] The doctor called
last week and told me.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.619
I just didn't tell you because I...
I really...

I really like the new Steve.

15:55.122 --> 15:59.817

so I don't blow Bambi's brains out.

to spend your last few days?

a dialysis appointment.

didn't tell him that he's not dying.

20:02.138 --> 20:06.775
That is good news. Because your so-called
replacement over here just quit!

20:06.776 --> 20:09.778
I knew you weren't responsible
enough to respect a gun.

20:09.779 --> 20:11.579
These things aren't toys, Malloy!

20:11.580 --> 20:16.318
"Look at me, I've got a big gun!
Doe, tee-doe, tee-doe, tee-doe!"

20:16.319 --> 20:17.686
Whoopsie.

20:17.687 --> 20:21.824
As if I didn't have enough bullshit,
now I've got blood on my wall!

20:21.825 --> 20:24.293
Congratulations, Steven.

20:24.294 --> 20:27.462
I'm glad to tell you you
just squeaked into heaven.

20:27.463 --> 20:28.496
Who the hell are you?

20:28.497 --> 20:30.632
I am God, my son.

20:30.633 --> 20:32.667
Welcome to my glorious kingdom.

20:32.668 --> 20:34.820
This man is a fraud!

20:34.821 --> 20:37.673
Everyone knows God is black!

20:37.674 --> 20:39.647
You goddamn God impostor!

20:39.648 --> 20:40.848
[Grunts]

20:40.849 --> 20:46.749
That does it. You just bought
yourself a one-way ticket to hell.

20:47.483 --> 20:50.243
Yup. Makes sense.
