All-new Wednesday at 10:00
on FXX.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.972
And next day, FX on Hulu.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.112
NADJA: So, yes,
it has been quite a summer.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.940
-We finally got a new familiar.-Yeah.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.726
-But he had an accident
and died.
-Yeah.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.815
-Left a bit. Left a bit more.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.643
It's not even.

00:36.427 --> 00:39.300
Ooh. Shit.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.910
So we found another one
and she had an accident

00:40.953 --> 00:43.304
and she died.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.740
-Oh, fuck.

00:47.482 --> 00:52.008
I had what is known
as a summer of self-discovery.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.011
I was being a vapor

00:55.055 --> 00:59.885
and I got sucked
into an air purifier.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.366
But apart from that,

01:02.410 --> 01:04.238
pretty slow summer.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.370
And then the same thing
happened with the next one.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.505
I spent so much time at the DMV

01:10.548 --> 01:12.942
they finally just
gave me a license.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.901
I did what any young,
handsome man would do,

01:15.945 --> 01:18.904
I went and bought
a classic convertible,

01:18.948 --> 01:23.387
put the top down,
blasted some tunes and, uh,

01:23.431 --> 01:26.347
I blocked the entrance
to the Lincoln Tunnel.

01:26.390 --> 01:29.698
-This is gonna ruin
my day, too, you know.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.308
-And then the next one.
-Yep.

01:33.615 --> 01:38.359
NADJA:  We've been through about six--  no, seven familiars this year.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.361
-Seven?
-Yeah, remember Joey?

01:40.404 --> 01:42.537
No, my dear,
I'm not that familiar.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.280
No, don't you remember?

01:46.323 --> 01:48.499
His intestines came
straight out of his bum.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.588
-Oh, Joey. Yeah, yeah.
-Mm.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.460
Not much new with me.
I've been spending

01:52.503 --> 01:54.418
a lot more time
in the upstairs bathroom.

01:54.462 --> 01:57.508
But besides that, my summer's
been pretty mellow and-- Ooh.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.467
-There's this little guy.

01:59.510 --> 02:02.296
Here. I've been trying to make
friends with him all summer.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.341
Don't be afraid. Come on in.

02:13.437 --> 02:14.395
Oh, sh...

02:16.919 --> 02:19.530
That's the tenth vampire
I killed this month.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.489
These vampire assassins
keep trying to kill

02:21.532 --> 02:22.968
Nandor, Nadja and Laszlo

02:23.012 --> 02:26.015
ever since they escaped
from the Vampiric Council.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.451
I'm doing it
to protect my master.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.584
But I can't tell him
I'm a vampire killer,

02:29.627 --> 02:32.021
because then he'd have
to kill me.

02:32.064 --> 02:34.023
Guillermo, what are you doing?

02:34.066 --> 02:35.981
-Dusting.
-Well, can you dust
more quietly please?

02:36.025 --> 02:39.333
-I'm trying to sleep.
-Okay.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.770
GUILLERMO:
I haven't slept in 72 hours.
I've been eating

02:41.813 --> 02:42.945
these chocolate-covered
espresso beans.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.338
They give you enough pep
just to keep going

02:44.381 --> 02:45.600
and just keep going, going,
going and pretend...

02:45.643 --> 02:47.297
-Ah!
-NANDOR: Guillermo?

02:47.341 --> 02:49.430
Someone's in here!
Please don't open the door.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.562
NANDOR:
Did you make
a messy toilet again?

02:51.606 --> 02:54.261
GUILLERMO:
I-I did. I-I had an accident.
Whoopsie.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.915
-Well, actually,
I just wanted to...
-No, Master, don't open...

02:56.959 --> 02:59.527
Oh, Guillermo.

02:59.570 --> 03:02.138
You should really
drink more water.

Anyway, that is all in the past,

03:42.874 --> 03:45.442
because we have finally
found us a good one.

03:45.486 --> 03:48.358
Topher, come in here!

03:48.402 --> 03:50.404
-Look at this.
-Tophie!

03:50.447 --> 03:53.102
Your skull polish, madam.

03:53.145 --> 03:54.973
-I'll be right outside.
-There he goes.

03:55.017 --> 03:58.063
Take care of business. Ooh.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.065
NADJA:
Topher is an absolutely

04:00.109 --> 04:03.068
"Bob's your money"
spectacular familiar.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.374
And his résumé

04:04.418 --> 04:06.071
is impeccable.

04:06.115 --> 04:08.596
LASZLO:
It is. He is proficient
in Excel.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.162
And went to Lehigh.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.643
Now, my wife and I
have not a whore's notion

04:12.687 --> 04:14.819
what any of that means.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.517
-But we like it.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.909
Need any help with that,
G-Money?

04:17.953 --> 04:19.694
Nah, I got it.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.913
It's like my father used to say.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.742
"Never accept a towel
from an Italian."

04:24.786 --> 04:27.528
-: Yeah. Topher.
-Very true, darling.

04:27.571 --> 04:28.703
-Master.
-Watching you stretch

04:28.746 --> 04:30.922
your young body
across that fireplace,

04:30.966 --> 04:33.098
-you know who you remind me of?-Who, Master?

04:33.142 --> 04:34.970
-Me.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.363
-Bring it in.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.060
-You're the best.

04:38.103 --> 04:40.845
-NANDOR: Guillermo! Guillermo!
-Y-Yes, Master?

04:40.889 --> 04:43.065
Yes?

04:43.108 --> 04:45.676
I dragged my cape through
a street doo-doo again.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.026
I dragged it for three blocks
before I noticed

04:48.070 --> 04:49.854
and I'm embarrassed to say
I dragged it

04:49.898 --> 04:51.682
for another eight blocks
after that.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.598
-Why did you do that, Master?-Well, I thought it would help,

04:54.642 --> 04:56.644
you know, drag the doo-doo off.

04:56.687 --> 04:59.124
-Anyway, take care of it please.
-TOPHER: Hey, uh,

04:59.168 --> 05:00.909
-you want me to fly in
with the assist?
-NANDOR: No!

05:00.952 --> 05:02.606
TOPHER:
That actually
is a-a lot of shit on it.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.043
This is a good solo job
for Guillermo.

05:05.087 --> 05:08.133
But thank you for the hustle,
Topherino!

05:08.177 --> 05:09.134
-TOPHER: Look out.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.006
-Hustle...?
-I don't think so.

05:12.529 --> 05:15.402
-NANDOR:
It looks fantastic in here.
-LASZLO: Doesn't it?

05:15.445 --> 05:17.491
-I could watch him clean
all day.
-NANDOR: Yes.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.144
TOPHER:
All right, I'm glad
to hear you say that.

05:19.188 --> 05:20.624
Uh-huh.

05:20.668 --> 05:21.625
All right.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.627
All right! Bye, Bobby.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.716
It's my little side hustle.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.719
I'm a 0.5 percent owner in thisdope new line of hard ciders.

05:28.763 --> 05:32.723
-It's called Doze Apples
Hard Cider.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.596
That's clever, 'cause it--
they're made with apples.

05:35.639 --> 05:36.553
Apple flavoring,

05:36.597 --> 05:38.163
-we have to say.
-Do Laszlo and Nadja

05:38.207 --> 05:39.774
-know about this?
-Eh.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.166
What they don't know
can't hurt them.

05:41.210 --> 05:43.604
-Am I right? High five.
-I...

05:43.647 --> 05:45.170
-Come on, dawg.
Don't leave me hanging.
-I don't know. Just...

05:45.214 --> 05:46.737
-With our job...
-Dawg. Don't leave me
hanging, dawg.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.610
-And we're just...
-Dawg. Don't leave me hang...

05:49.653 --> 05:51.176
-I just think that...-No, give me a better one, dawg.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.395
-I just think...
-Again, high five!

05:52.439 --> 05:54.571
Oh, yeah. High five.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.094
I feel like there's a way

05:56.138 --> 05:58.532
to be cool-- which you are,
you're very cool...

05:58.575 --> 06:00.534
-Thank you.
-...and also, respectful,
you know?

06:00.577 --> 06:02.449
You need to let them know

06:02.492 --> 06:05.190
that you are worthy of being
turned into a vampire someday.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.844
-Which is why we're here.
-To be honest,

06:06.888 --> 06:08.585
I don't really care
about being a vampire.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.022
I'm sorry, what?

06:11.066 --> 06:13.111
Yeah, yeah,
I was very surprised

06:13.155 --> 06:15.636
that Topher does not
want to be a vampire.

06:15.679 --> 06:16.985
Who doesn't
want to be a vampire?

06:17.028 --> 06:20.249
What are you doing
if you don't...

06:20.292 --> 06:22.033
-What-what do you want to be?
-TOPHER: I don't know.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.557
Maybe a warlock.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.036
-That'd be cool.
-That would be cool.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.821
That's, like, above vampire.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.692
Alla-kazoom!

06:28.736 --> 06:31.042
And it would explode
or something.

06:31.086 --> 06:34.742
GUILLERMO:
He's still learning.
He's still finding himself.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.091
He'll get there.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.267
So, these are like money.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.748
You go to any store that sells
Doze Apples Hard Cider,

06:40.791 --> 06:43.228
pay for the cider
with real money, but then,

06:43.272 --> 06:45.579
you mail in this card to
the address there on the back.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.582
And I can explain
this whole process

06:48.625 --> 06:50.671
as I'm handing these out?

06:50.714 --> 06:52.673
Oh, yeah.
Sometimes more than once.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.240
-You know, if you want,
you can drain me right now.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.025
I'm, like, firing on all
four cylinders, you know?

06:57.068 --> 06:59.070
You can crunch up as much as youwant. I can make some more.

06:59.114 --> 07:00.942
I-- Yeah, I want to, Topher,

07:00.985 --> 07:04.032
but I'm having a pickle
of a time draining you.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.642
I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson.

07:05.686 --> 07:08.036
-Like, I know
you're trying to bore me--

07:08.079 --> 07:10.212
-Hang on.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.519
Come on in.

07:14.738 --> 07:17.262
The stuff that you tell me
is just so interesting.

07:17.306 --> 07:18.655
You know?

07:18.699 --> 07:20.701
Sue me.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.833
-Who was at the door?
-I don't know.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.706
Unbelievable. Topher?

07:25.749 --> 07:28.056
Topher, did you happen to let
two vampires into the house?

07:28.099 --> 07:30.101
-Hey, hang on, dawg.
-Look, there's a couple rules
you need to follow.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.842
-I know you're new, okay, but...-Sorry, just, uh,

07:31.886 --> 07:33.714
conferencing with this guy
I used to intern for,

07:33.757 --> 07:35.585
this dope werewolf--
You might know him, actually.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.979
First of all, werewolves are notdope, so I wouldn't know him.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.763
-Uh, this guy's pretty dope.
-No.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.635
Look, I don't mean to be hard
on you, but it's important

07:41.678 --> 07:43.854
you follow the rules
for everyone's safety.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.639
Do me a favor and stay away
from the koi pond.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.815
I think there's an electrical
short from the heater, so just

07:47.858 --> 07:49.817
-stay away from it...
-Have you tried turning it
off and back on again?

07:49.860 --> 07:51.645
No, just don't touch it,
Topher, okay?

07:51.688 --> 07:53.734
-The electric guy's
gonna be here on Monday.
-Always works for me.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.083
So just leave it alone...

07:57.781 --> 08:00.871
GUILLERMO: Yeah. I'm sad that Topher died.

08:00.915 --> 08:03.744
Another familiar dead, you know?

08:03.787 --> 08:06.660
But... that's the business.

08:06.703 --> 08:09.271
I'm used to it.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.142
That's bad, right?

08:15.756 --> 08:17.714
Death comes for us all.

08:17.758 --> 08:20.717
It comes for the bees.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.719
It comes for the trees.

08:22.763 --> 08:27.681
It comes for, uh, basically
anyone from zero on up,

08:27.724 --> 08:29.900
so... one...

08:29.944 --> 08:31.119
LASZLO:
Are you kidding?

08:31.162 --> 08:33.295
...two, three, four.

08:33.338 --> 08:34.949
Put a cork in it,
Colin Robinson.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.386
-We're weak enough as it is.
-NANDOR: Perhaps there is

08:37.429 --> 08:40.389
-a familiar killer on the loose?-NADJA: What?

08:40.432 --> 08:42.173
Well, I was just thinking,
you know,

08:42.217 --> 08:43.740
if there are vampire killers,

08:43.784 --> 08:46.787
then why not
familiar killers, also?

08:46.830 --> 08:48.832
There's no such thing asvampire killers, you knob lord.

08:48.876 --> 08:51.356
-Well...
-What was that, Guillermo?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.923
I'm just saying
that it wouldn't hurt

08:52.967 --> 08:54.882
to be more cautious and alert.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.318
NADJA:
Enough of this!

08:56.361 --> 08:58.102
This is horse piss.
We are vampires.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.148
We can do better
than this for our Topher.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.889
Guillermo, dig him up.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.064
Yes.

09:03.107 --> 09:05.370
Please be respectful of his mud.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.198
A necromancer is someone

09:07.242 --> 09:09.113
who can reanimate the dead.

09:09.157 --> 09:12.029
It's a truly fantastical part
of the dark arts.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.815
And I happen to have
a very good old pal

09:14.858 --> 09:16.817
-Wallace...

09:16.860 --> 09:20.734
...who is excellently proficientin the art of necromancy.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.867
No, he's excellent, at the darkart of ripping you off.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.739
-These people are shysters.

09:25.782 --> 09:28.176
They're obsessed
with the upsell.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.744
I'm sure his hut
is around here somewhere.

09:30.787 --> 09:33.181
It's a classic necromancer scam.

09:33.224 --> 09:36.271
"Meet me at my hut."
What bloody hut?

09:37.359 --> 09:39.840
There it is. I'm certain of it.

09:39.883 --> 09:42.190
Look at all those pale,
desperate wretches

09:42.233 --> 09:43.974
scurrying around
in the moonlight.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.933
It's a performing arts school.

09:45.976 --> 09:49.110
COLIN:
Hey, a high school production
of Thornton Wilder's

09:49.153 --> 09:51.808
Our Townwith a Q and A
afterwards.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.550
-Don't mind if I do. Yum, yum.
-WALLACE: You seek

09:54.594 --> 09:56.421
the necromancer?

09:56.465 --> 09:58.206
LASZLO:
What the...?

09:58.249 --> 10:00.208
I am they.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.426
Hello, Wallace!

10:03.037 --> 10:04.995
NADJA:
Come on, everyone!

10:05.039 --> 10:08.477
-WALLACE: I've got a lovely potof stew if anyone's hungry.
-LASZLO: No.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.959
-I see you admiring my wares.
Anything tickle your fancy?
-No.

10:12.002 --> 10:15.310
-NADJA: Hush.
-These bracelets
ward off the evil eye.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.747
-NADJA: Ooh. Ooh.-This one attracts the evil eye.

10:17.791 --> 10:21.795
-And this one increases
sexual stamina. Yeah.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.971
You could do with a leg up.

10:24.014 --> 10:27.757
-And these are key chains
that look like license plates.
-NADJA: Uh-huh.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.324
LASZLO:
Look, mister,
we are not interested

10:29.367 --> 10:31.892
in your tricks and trinkets.

10:31.935 --> 10:34.851
This one would make a cute giftfor a man named Steve.

10:34.895 --> 10:37.898
NADJA:
Yes, yes, yes, but, Wallace,
what we are here for

10:37.941 --> 10:39.029
is we were hoping
you could reanimate

10:39.073 --> 10:40.465
our beloved familiar Topher.

10:40.509 --> 10:43.207
Yes, uh, how long
has he been dead?

10:43.251 --> 10:45.906
-Huh?
-Oh, that is Guillermo.

10:45.949 --> 10:48.473
He is not dead, although
sometimes we wish he was.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.477
Just a little joke there,
Guillermo,

10:52.521 --> 10:54.044
I got it.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.872
All right, so, uh,
where's the carcass?

10:55.916 --> 10:59.223
Yes. Guillermo,
fetch the carcass.

10:59.267 --> 11:02.183
-The what?
-The carcass.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.838
-The cadaver, man.
-I'll go get the body.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.970
NANDOR:
What was that?

11:07.014 --> 11:08.929
I'll go get the carcass.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.060
NANDOR:
Better.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.852
And did you bring a personalitem belonging to the deceased?

11:18.895 --> 11:21.289
Uh, yes, uh, his mini-fridge.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.291
Uh, Guillermo, you did
bring the mini-fridge, yeah?

11:23.334 --> 11:26.990
He absolutely loved
this cold, white little box.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.949
And the foot of a deranged cat,

11:28.992 --> 11:31.603
the night-thistle,
the parcel of wolf's-bane

11:31.647 --> 11:34.084
and the $350 cash?

11:34.128 --> 11:35.825
-Thank you.
-It's all there,

11:35.869 --> 11:37.087
razzle-dazzle man.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.481
Good, good.
I can't stress enough

11:39.524 --> 11:41.570
the $350 cash.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.355
-Yeah, I'll bet you can't.
-Otherwise,
the spells don't work.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.314
Wallace,do you think we are going to get

11:46.357 --> 11:49.534
-our beloved Topher back?-Well, he seems well preserved.

11:49.578 --> 11:52.537
Everything seems to want to...
seems to be intact.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.539
He hasn't had that, uh,

11:54.583 --> 11:56.280
intestines out of the asshole,
has he?

11:56.324 --> 11:57.368
-No, no.
-Good,

11:57.412 --> 11:59.327
'cause that really yucks me out.

11:59.370 --> 12:02.112
Right, then, here we go.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.645
It's true.
I've got to admit,

13:40.689 --> 13:42.952
Wallace, as contemptible
a man as he is,

13:42.996 --> 13:47.087
-actually came up trumps.
-: Told you so.

13:47.130 --> 13:50.220
You fucking didn't.

13:50.264 --> 13:53.093
Don't tell Guillermo, but...

13:53.136 --> 13:55.399
I'm so happy Topher is back.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.621
All right,
let us begin with the minutes.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.231
I am here.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.451
Guillermo, you are there.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.105
And, um...

14:05.148 --> 14:06.889
TOPHER :
To-pher!

14:06.933 --> 14:08.369
NADJA :
Oh, Tophie!

14:08.412 --> 14:09.457
And there is Topher.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.588
Wonderful.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.286
We are all here.
We can begin.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.201
Firstly--
and I'm not naming names--

14:14.244 --> 14:17.291
but I have recently noticed
that the house reeks

14:17.334 --> 14:20.076
of decaying flesh, and there aredead birds everywhere.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.686
TOPHER:
Topher!

14:21.730 --> 14:23.514
As I say, I'm not naming names.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.473
But if we do have an issue,

14:25.516 --> 14:27.475
then it's important
that we all work together

14:27.518 --> 14:30.304
to let Guillermo know,
so that he can fix it.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.262
TOPHER:
Doze Apples!

14:35.526 --> 14:36.788
LASZLO:
Off he goes.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.529
That chap's tireless, isn't he?

14:38.573 --> 14:41.576
You could learn something
from Topher, no, Guillermo?

14:41.619 --> 14:43.491
I actually have an orderof business I'd like to discuss.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.058
-Oh...
-NANDOR: Okay.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.277
-The floor is yours.
-I'm a little bit concerned

14:47.321 --> 14:48.452
about Topher.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.280
I think there might be
something

14:50.324 --> 14:52.282
-really wrong with him.

14:52.326 --> 14:55.024
-Topher! Aah!

14:55.068 --> 14:58.288
-He waits under my bed  and tries to bite me, for one. -NANDOR: Yes.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.029
He eats live birds and insects.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.162
I think, I think
he might be a zombie.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.427
That, my boy,
sounds like slander.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.169
Nandor, what are you going to doabout the state of the muck

15:09.212 --> 15:10.474
-pouring out of his mouth?
-Guillermo,

15:10.518 --> 15:12.302
do you have any proof
of this wild accusation?

15:12.346 --> 15:14.348
-Aah!

15:17.786 --> 15:18.830
Well, do you?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.571
He's not well!

15:20.615 --> 15:22.312
-He's freaking out.
-Yes!

15:22.356 --> 15:24.314
He's gonna eat me!
Dios mío!

15:24.358 --> 15:25.707
LASZLO:
Well, now he's
speaking in tongues.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.274
That is awful of you
to call Topher

15:27.317 --> 15:28.405
those things you just did.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.193
Exactly.

15:33.236 --> 15:36.196
Guillermo, have you
been getting enough sleep?

15:36.239 --> 15:37.980
: No. No,
I am not getting any sleep!

15:38.024 --> 15:40.287
I haven't slept
in the last two weeks,

15:40.330 --> 15:43.203
because I have to keep one eye
open to protect you guys!

15:43.246 --> 15:45.553
-Protect us from what?

15:49.339 --> 15:50.732
Nothing.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.560
I just wish you guys knew
how hard I work for you,

15:52.603 --> 15:55.215
and you don't, so that's okay,
never mind, forget it.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.304
Did you see that?

15:57.347 --> 15:59.654
-He was eating
his own dry poops.

16:05.312 --> 16:07.227
The vampire assassins
usually come at night,

16:07.270 --> 16:08.750
so I have to constantly survey
the perimeter.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.598
Topher!

16:30.641 --> 16:33.166
Topher? No, no, no, no, no, no!

16:33.209 --> 16:34.950
I don't wanna die, I don't
wanna die, I don't wanna...

16:40.651 --> 16:42.305
Sorry. Sorry.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.177
Why...?

16:44.220 --> 16:47.876
Sorry, buddy,but you were trying to kill me.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.358
High five.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.229
I don't know, bud.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.666
-Come on!
-Okay. All right.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.451
-Aw, shit.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.366
-Why?!
-Sorry, Toph.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.281
See, that's why
I didn't want to do that.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.413
-Toph.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.633
No, buddy, I don't think it's
gonna go back on there, bud.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.331
High five!

17:08.375 --> 17:09.724
No, I'm not gonna
high-five you anymore.

17:09.767 --> 17:10.855
High five!

17:10.899 --> 17:12.814
Ow, Toph! That really hurt!

17:12.857 --> 17:14.598
-High five!
-Stop it, you...

17:14.642 --> 17:16.470
You're being really rude
right now!

17:16.513 --> 17:18.124
-Stop it! Stop it!

17:19.429 --> 17:21.388
Stop it, Topher.
Stop it, Topher!

17:21.431 --> 17:24.086
-Stop it, Topher!

17:24.130 --> 17:25.914
Aw, fuck no!

17:25.957 --> 17:28.438
No one bites Guillermo!

17:31.311 --> 17:33.313
It was an accident.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.708
All right, dudes,
I'm headed out.

17:37.752 --> 17:40.450
Going up to Albany to catch
a community theater production

17:40.494 --> 17:41.886
of Pippin.

17:44.889 --> 17:48.328
What's going on with,
uh, Toph-Dawg?

17:48.371 --> 17:50.330
I think he's a zombie.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.635
Yeah, could be.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.420
-See you guys later.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.683
You goofballs.

18:08.435 --> 18:09.523
GUILLERMO:
No!

18:09.566 --> 18:12.308
Why won't you die?!

18:15.398 --> 18:17.139
Stop it! Stop it!

18:17.183 --> 18:18.227
Ow!

18:19.968 --> 18:22.405
Jesus fucking...!

18:22.449 --> 18:25.060
Topher!

18:30.370 --> 18:32.894
Guillermo!

18:34.374 --> 18:36.289
GUILLERMO:
Master...

18:36.332 --> 18:38.204
you saved me.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.683
Thank you.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.512
Your screaming disturbed me
from my slumber.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.384
You shouldn't be putting
your head in there.

18:44.427 --> 18:45.254
It's not hygienic.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.951
If you want to wash yourself,
do it in...

18:46.995 --> 18:48.562
Will you stop that!

18:48.605 --> 18:50.781
-I've had enough of this.

18:54.568 --> 18:58.311
He was a good familiar
and a fine fellow.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.530
-But what is done is done.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.316
This fuckin' guy.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.326
He was a good familiar
and a fine fellow.

19:13.369 --> 19:14.762
But what is done is done.

19:16.459 --> 19:19.245
Are you kidding me with this
right now?

19:19.288 --> 19:22.422
Just give him a few jolts.
I'll be fine.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.511
He was a good familiar
and a fine fellow.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.428
Kind of tickles.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.519
You conned us,
you slippery bastard!

19:32.562 --> 19:34.564
Wallace,
how could you do this to us?

19:34.608 --> 19:37.001
Yeah, plus, he was crawling
on the ceiling, which is odd.

19:37.045 --> 19:39.482
-Well, he didn't do that before?-NADJA: Of course not!

19:39.526 --> 19:41.789
Well, okay, I must have used
the wrong incantation spell.

19:41.832 --> 19:44.487
But you know what?
No extra charge.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.141
-Bullshit! You made it up
as you were going along.
-No, no, no, no,

19:46.185 --> 19:48.448
that was word-for-word verbatim.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.537
No. You were bloody texting
on your phone the whole time!

19:50.580 --> 19:52.582
It was an Amber Alert.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.236
Well, I did think
it was important.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.021
He is damaged goods,
and we demand satisfaction!

19:57.065 --> 20:00.503
-Not cool, Wallace, not cool.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.331
-Fine. Let me have him.
-What, do you think

20:02.375 --> 20:04.464
I'm gonna let him go?
You must be out of your mind.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.076
Come here, boy.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.556
Come on, come on.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.777
That'll do, pig, that'll do.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.388
-Wow.
-All right,

20:15.431 --> 20:17.172
I don't normally do refunds,

20:17.216 --> 20:19.000
but I'll take him
off your hands for you.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.393
And for your trouble,

20:20.436 --> 20:23.657
each of you can grab
a license plate key chain.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.615
For free?

20:25.659 --> 20:27.182
Free. Gratis.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.749
Okay.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.533
Come on!

20:30.577 --> 20:33.493
-Oh. "Ingrid." Oh.
-NANDOR: I got...

20:33.536 --> 20:34.624
"Steve."

20:34.668 --> 20:38.585
So if you're watching, Steve...

20:38.628 --> 20:40.543
waiting for you.

20:40.587 --> 20:41.849
Ah.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.633
NADJA:
I got "Nadia," uh,

20:43.677 --> 20:46.506
which is my name,
but with a less exciting "J."

20:46.549 --> 20:48.508
Completely free.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.031
You don't have "Colin."

20:50.074 --> 20:52.512
We haven't sold any
since 1979, mate.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.514
But you have "Condom."

20:54.557 --> 20:56.603
Very, very popular.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.431
-Can I take one?
-Go for it.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.084
GUILLERMO:
So I got...

21:00.128 --> 21:01.434
"Gigi."

21:01.477 --> 21:03.914
I guess that's better
than "Gizmo."

21:07.396 --> 21:10.312
Being a familiar
isn't for everyone.

21:10.356 --> 21:14.055
You're not always thanked
or praised.

21:14.098 --> 21:17.145
But after my master
saved my life,

21:17.188 --> 21:20.104
he proved to me that...
he really does care about me

21:20.148 --> 21:22.455
and all the things I do for him.

21:22.498 --> 21:26.285
And if one day
he doesn't, well...

21:44.520 --> 21:47.567
Here you go. Down there.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.569
That be slippy there, hang on.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.919
Here you go.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.399
Topher!

21:53.442 --> 21:54.922
Yep.

21:54.965 --> 21:57.316
Just uh, copy what they do,
you'll be fine.

21:58.534 --> 21:59.796
Doze Apples!

21:59.840 --> 22:01.494
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very good.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.713
Be back to check on you
next year.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.976
Doze Apples.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.543
WALLACE:
Yes, yes.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.765
FEMALE ZOMBIE:
Gigi.

22:11.808 --> 22:14.594
MALE ZOMBIE:

-VOCALIST: Hey!

23:10.214 --> 23:11.564
-Mom.
-Yes?

23:11.694 --> 23:13.827
-Okay. I want
a big party this year.
-Serious?

23:13.870 --> 23:16.177
-I want a quinceañera.
-Quinceañera?

23:16.220 --> 23:19.398
We can't do that.
We're too white for that.
We're not allowed.

23:28.711 --> 23:31.671
Do me a favor?Never look me in the eye again.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.674
Okay? 'Cause your stare
is way too intense.

23:34.717 --> 23:36.502
It's starting to make
my hair fall out.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.465
I'm good at reading and writing.

23:43.596 --> 23:46.468
Yes, you are. You know,
I wanted to be a writer
when I was a kid.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.557
Or an artist, you know?

23:48.601 --> 23:50.646
Cartoonist, maybe.
Combine the two.

23:50.690 --> 23:51.691
Why didn't you?

23:53.519 --> 23:55.216
-Wake up!

23:55.259 --> 23:56.913
-You two came along.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.698
-Bing, bing, bing!
-Oh!

23:58.741 --> 24:00.656
-Life gets in the way, don't it?--

24:01.265 --> 24:02.484
Oh. Ow!

24:02.528 --> 24:03.703
You drift.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.052
-Ahh.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.489
I'm not blaming you.
Just... you did ask.
Right.

24:12.929 --> 24:14.888
I would like to explore the idea

24:14.931 --> 24:16.585
of tokenism
in the workplace,

24:16.629 --> 24:19.109
where one minority is propped up

24:19.153 --> 24:21.677
to cover the experience
of the entire population.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.244
WOMAN: That's interesting.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.289
Wait. Sorry. You're not sayingyou feel that way here?

24:34.429 --> 24:37.040
Cause precedes effect.

24:37.084 --> 24:38.694
Effect leads to cause.

24:39.826 --> 24:43.177
The future is fixed
in exactly the same way
as the past.
