00:54.654 --> 00:56.463
Thank you.

00:56.489 --> 00:57.797
Thank you.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.612
Is something wrong?

01:09.836 --> 01:11.907
Nothing new, I'm afraid.

01:11.938 --> 01:15.818
Must we have this discussion
each and every week?

01:16.976 --> 01:20.150
At 30 years of age, your time
to discuss has nearly run out.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.717
Thank you, Dean.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.127
You certainly know how to charm a lady.

01:26.853 --> 01:29.800
I'm sorry you're so discontented.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.770
Wanting to try for a son is hardly a crime.

01:36.796 --> 01:40.676
Let's get you into bed.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.476
Come on, turn around. Let's go.

01:50.710 --> 01:54.089
Is Father angry with me?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.752
Not at all.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.693
He's simply tired.

01:57.717 --> 02:00.357
Lie back.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.889
Go to sleep, Veronica.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.978
Veronica, time to get up.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.350
Veronica, get up, sleepy.

02:37.690 --> 02:40.068
Veronica?

02:44.831 --> 02:46.333
Dean!

02:47.667 --> 02:48.839
Dean!

02:48.868 --> 02:50.814
It doesn't make any sense, Detective.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.339
Why would someone abduct our daughter

02:52.372 --> 02:54.716
and leave behind a doll in her place?

02:54.741 --> 02:57.244
Could she have left of her own accord?

02:57.277 --> 02:59.655
Was she unhappy in any way?

02:59.679 --> 03:01.522
Had she been scolded recently?

03:01.548 --> 03:04.256
No.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.321
That doll does not belong to Veronica.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.423
Someone deliberately left it in her bed.

03:08.454 --> 03:10.695
Do either of you know of anyone

03:10.723 --> 03:13.101
who would want to target
your daughter for abduction?

03:13.126 --> 03:15.333
Target? No, not at all.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.432
You mean for the purposes of extortion?

03:17.463 --> 03:18.703
It is a possibility.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.176
No, stop talking.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.443
Please, stop talking, and find her.

03:30.643 --> 03:33.021
Looks to be fine craftsmanship.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.458
Barely out of its package, I would say.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.017
What's that?

03:37.050 --> 03:39.291
It's a version of Edison's talking doll.

03:39.319 --> 03:41.959
There's a recorded cylinder inside.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.260
Hello, Detective Murdoch.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.134
Will you play with me?

03:52.799 --> 03:54.642
Hello, Detective Murdoch.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.442
Will you play with me?

03:56.469 --> 03:58.813
Why would you be named
personally in this matter?

03:58.838 --> 04:01.409
Have you in some way put
our daughter in jeopardy?

04:01.441 --> 04:04.251
Certainly not on purpose.

04:04.277 --> 04:07.383
I admit, I'm as baffled as you are

04:07.413 --> 04:10.121
that the kidnapper has
mentioned me by name.

04:10.149 --> 04:11.560
So who did this?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.757
I have no idea.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.163
There's no sign of forced entry,

04:15.188 --> 04:17.600
no finger marks on the
doors or windowsills,

04:17.624 --> 04:18.829
not even the girl's.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.269
Her name is Veronica.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.839
Yes, of course.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.172
MY apologies.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.008
Yes.

04:28.034 --> 04:31.607
Mr. and Mrs. Bowden,

04:31.638 --> 04:35.142
this was a professional operation.

04:35.174 --> 04:39.281
The kidnapper was careful,
and they took their time.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.918
How did the kidnapper get
Veronica out of the house

04:41.948 --> 04:43.518
without her making a noise?

04:43.549 --> 04:46.120
Surely we would have heard something.

04:47.553 --> 04:50.090
Perhaps she knew her abductor,

04:50.123 --> 04:52.330
someone in the neighborhood.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.668
Whereabouts do you live, Mr. Carson?

04:54.694 --> 04:56.833
In the rooming house across the street,

04:56.863 --> 04:58.706
second floor.

04:58.731 --> 05:01.177
When did you last see Veronica?

05:01.200 --> 05:04.204
Yesterday, in the park.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.717
There was a boy about her age.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.218
He often wanted to play with her,

05:08.241 --> 05:10.687
but she was too shy.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.314
It was rather sweet, actually.

05:12.345 --> 05:13.551
Hmm.

05:13.579 --> 05:15.820
Did you see anyone loitering about,

05:15.848 --> 05:17.452
anything suspicious?

05:17.483 --> 05:19.087
No, I didn't.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.232
Thank you for your time.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.895
If you see Veronica or anything unusual,

05:24.924 --> 05:27.165
please contact me directly.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.002
Of course.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.132
Anything, George?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.403
Sir, various sightings

05:31.431 --> 05:33.570
but none more recent than yesterday.

05:33.599 --> 05:35.840
Ms. Balfour here, this spinster,

05:35.868 --> 05:37.848
hadn't seen the girl in days.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.749
But Ms. James, this
blonde lady, a seamstress,

05:40.773 --> 05:43.253
saw her last night
walking with her parents.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.755
This young lad, Gregory,

05:44.777 --> 05:46.484
used to play hide-and-seek
with Veronica.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.755
And then Ms. Rosevear, the
lady I was just speaking with,

05:49.782 --> 05:52.319
used to mind Veronica from time to time.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.697
So Veronica would be familiar with her,

05:55.722 --> 05:57.668
and she would know the layout of the house.

05:57.690 --> 06:01.035
Exactly, and she just asked
me if you were William Murdoch.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.368
Oh'?

06:08.267 --> 06:09.439
Ms. Rosevear?

06:09.469 --> 06:11.608
Yes.

06:11.637 --> 06:14.083
I understand you minded
Veronica from time to time?

06:14.107 --> 06:15.279
Oh, I did.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.413
She was like a younger sister to me.

06:17.443 --> 06:19.445
Hmm.

06:19.479 --> 06:22.085
Are you going on a trip?

06:22.115 --> 06:24.095
Oh, I just returned from Winnipeg.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.926
Visiting relatives.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.898
I see.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.093
How is it you know who I am?

06:30.123 --> 06:34.037
Doesn't everyone know who you are, sir?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.199
Ah, I doubt that.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.230
Well, I do.

06:37.263 --> 06:40.472
I follow all of your cases in the Gazette.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.642
You are an extremely accomplished man.

06:47.740 --> 06:52.314
Do you have any idea who could
have taken young Veronica?

06:52.345 --> 06:54.621
Uh... no.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.821
Do you know of anyone who may
have wished the family harm?

06:57.850 --> 06:59.852
No one at all.

07:02.321 --> 07:03.322
Thank you.

07:12.298 --> 07:14.801
George, verify her alibi.

07:14.834 --> 07:15.835
Sir.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.113
I know it's supposed to be adorable,

07:21.140 --> 07:23.086
but to me, it just looks bloody creepy.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.315
I have to agree,

07:24.343 --> 07:26.584
especially considering the circumstances.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.819
There's still no word
on any ransom demands?

07:28.848 --> 07:31.260
None, which may rule out financial motive

07:31.284 --> 07:32.695
for the girl's abduction.

07:32.718 --> 07:35.198
Well, judging from what
the doll has to say,

07:35.221 --> 07:37.861
we know there's at
least one personal angle.

07:37.890 --> 07:40.200
Any idea who'd bother
taunting you like this?

07:40.226 --> 07:41.830
No.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.169
And what's the connection

07:43.196 --> 07:45.267
between myself and the missing girl

07:45.298 --> 07:46.709
or her family?

07:46.732 --> 07:49.110
Seems to me there's one
clue staring you in the face.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.876
There were no finger marks on the doll

07:50.903 --> 07:53.315
or the internal recording cylinder.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.444
Do we know where it came from, who made it?

07:55.475 --> 07:59.150
It was manufactured in
France, at no small cost.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.283
Someone with means, then.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.124
Sirs, I looked into Ms. Rosevear's alibi.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.190
At least three people
confirmed she was in Winnipeg.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.197
I see.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.757
I think it's time you two
went and did a bit of shopping.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.809
Sir!

08:20.833 --> 08:23.006
Sir, I spoke with the people

08:23.035 --> 08:26.346
at the gifts and novelty shop
down on the corner, and they-

08:27.340 --> 08:28.318
Excuse me, sir.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.820
They have these miniature tractors,

08:29.842 --> 08:32.049
cast iron, all with movable parts.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.490
I feel like I was born too soon, sir.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.015
Talking dolls, George.

08:36.048 --> 08:37.686
Did they sell any dolls?

08:37.717 --> 08:39.321
One and only one
- it was bought and shipped

08:39.352 --> 08:40.729
to Montreal about two months ago.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.732
Right, we'll have to follow up on that.

08:42.755 --> 08:43.995
As for this shop,

08:44.023 --> 08:46.367
the owner recalls selling two talking dolls

08:46.392 --> 08:48.167
but doesn't remember the customers' names.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.571
Society women, apparently.

08:49.595 --> 08:50.767
Hmm.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.400
So where does that leave us?

08:52.431 --> 08:53.501
On the trail of the dolls.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.705
We have to go to the source,

08:54.734 --> 08:56.543
and I've obtained the
name of the distributor.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.446
Oh, excellent.

09:23.162 --> 09:27.201
Toronto Constabulary.
A moment of your time?

09:27.233 --> 09:29.144
Hello again, Detective.

09:29.168 --> 09:30.272
Mr. Carson.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.577
What brings you here?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.315
Veronica Bowden was abducted from her home.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.788
You knew her, knew where she lived.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.155
A talking doll was left on her bed.

09:41.180 --> 09:43.285
A doll that was distributed
from this warehouse.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.795
No, no, no, no, just a minute.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.956
I had nothing to do with
that girl's disappearance.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.796
And I'm not the
distributor. I'm a stock boy.

09:49.822 --> 09:51.096
We have dozens of imports.

09:51.123 --> 09:52.659
The talking doll is just one of them.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.228
I'd like to see your records,

09:54.260 --> 09:56.672
especially those pertaining
to the talking dolls.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.767
Certainly.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.682
As you can see, the dolls
are a specialty item.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.845
Only a handful of shops have carried them,

10:08.874 --> 10:10.581
two or three orders at most.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.453
What about this one,

10:12.478 --> 10:15.982
an order for five of the talking dolls

10:16.015 --> 10:17.085
three weeks ago?

10:17.116 --> 10:18.356
That's right.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.295
Can you describe the customer?

10:20.319 --> 10:21.627
From what I remember,

10:21.654 --> 10:23.759
it was a rather tall blonde woman

10:23.789 --> 10:26.599
in her 20s, maybe 30s.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.333
She wore too much rouge for my liking.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.705
Hmm. And that's it?

10:30.730 --> 10:33.336
She walked out of here carrying five dolls?

10:33.366 --> 10:34.970
No, no, delivery was arranged.

10:35.001 --> 10:36.878
Oh, where to?

10:36.902 --> 10:38.040
Uh...

10:39.338 --> 10:41.011
Here we are.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.542
A hotel in the East End,

10:42.575 --> 10:45.078
the Empire, room 214.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.900
Veronica?

10:59.925 --> 11:01.029
Are you all right?

11:01.060 --> 11:03.666
Yes.

11:03.696 --> 11:06.074
You're safe now. We've
come to take you home.

11:06.098 --> 11:08.578
Your mother and father
have been worried about you.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.376
Why?

11:10.403 --> 11:12.508
I had cake.

11:12.538 --> 11:13.846
Who are you?

11:13.873 --> 11:16.046
My name is George. I'm a policeman.

11:16.075 --> 11:19.522
And my name is William,
Detective William Murdoch.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.547
Oh.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.420
This is for you.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.669
Help me, Detective Murdoch!

11:34.694 --> 11:36.196
I've lost my head!

11:36.228 --> 11:38.208
Can you help me find it?

11:45.771 --> 11:50.220
Veronica, who took you
from your bed last night?

11:52.945 --> 11:55.721
Was it a man or a woman?

11:55.748 --> 11:57.785
A man.

11:57.817 --> 12:01.094
A man. Did you know him?

12:01.120 --> 12:03.726
No.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.861
What did the man look like?

12:05.891 --> 12:11.102
Was he a tall man, or was he a small man?

12:11.130 --> 12:12.939
Do you remember what he was wearing?

12:12.965 --> 12:15.969
I never saw him. I was sleeping.

12:17.603 --> 12:21.210
Veronica, did this man hurt you in any way?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.810
No, he was nice.

12:22.842 --> 12:25.652
He said we were
playing hide-and-seek.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.318
Hmm.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.452
Did he say who you were hiding from?

12:30.483 --> 12:33.487
You. But you found me.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.363
Yes. Yes, I did.

12:38.357 --> 12:42.430
Veronica, did the man ever
make a voice like this?

12:43.529 --> 12:45.236
Help me, Detective Murdoch!

12:45.264 --> 12:46.743
I've lost my head!

12:46.766 --> 12:48.939
Can you help me find it?

12:51.370 --> 12:53.247
No.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.809
No.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.843
Well, thank you.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.289
But he said you were a bad person

13:00.312 --> 13:03.191
and that you aren't very clever.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.694
What sort of deranged
person decapitates a doll?

13:10.723 --> 13:13.101
I once sawed the head
off my late sister's doll.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.866
Whatever for?

13:14.894 --> 13:17.500
No particular reason that I recall.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.635
Well, whoever did this, I suspect,

13:19.665 --> 13:21.975
had a very specific reason for doing so.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.207
A threat, perhaps.

13:23.235 --> 13:24.839
To cut off the detective's head?

13:24.870 --> 13:26.315
No, I don't think so, George.

13:26.338 --> 13:27.510
Listen.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.281
Help me, Detective Murdoch!

13:29.308 --> 13:30.946
I've lost my head!

13:30.976 --> 13:33.320
Can you help me find it?

13:33.345 --> 13:35.382
You see, the doll is
speaking in the first person

13:35.414 --> 13:37.052
and referring to me in the second person.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.358
You think he's referring to his own head?

13:39.385 --> 13:41.365
As in a metaphor?

13:41.387 --> 13:43.196
As in he's off his bloody nut.

13:43.222 --> 13:45.168
I don't know, but what is clear

13:45.191 --> 13:47.000
is that he's gone to elaborate lengths

13:47.026 --> 13:49.506
to capture my attention.

13:49.528 --> 13:51.667
Perhaps the kidnapping of Veronica Bowden.

13:51.697 --> 13:55.167
Was just an opening gambit in
some kind of elaborate game.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.511
Be careful how you play it, Murdoch.

13:57.536 --> 13:59.709
This boy means you harm, serious harm.

13:59.738 --> 14:00.716
I don't doubt it.

14:00.739 --> 14:01.979
Sir, that voice-

14:02.007 --> 14:03.748
do you think that's his own, disguised?

14:03.776 --> 14:04.754
I suspect so.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.552
Or maybe it's the woman
who bought the dolls,

14:06.579 --> 14:07.922
a couple, working together.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.756
Or maybe it's simply another element

14:09.782 --> 14:11.853
designed to disconcert me.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.728
Julia.

14:15.754 --> 14:19.566
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.698
I was in the area and thought I'd stop by.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.366
Doctor, your practice is in the West End.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.672
Yes. Nevertheless, I-

14:26.699 --> 14:28.269
We must be on our way,

14:28.300 --> 14:30.780
although it was certainly nice
to see you again, Dr. Ogden.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.544
Come on, Crabtree.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.448
Likewise, Inspector. Constable.

14:34.473 --> 14:35.747
Doctor.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.388
Something amiss?

14:47.419 --> 14:51.265
No, everything is exactly
as I remembered it.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.096
Except for this.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.902
Ah, yes, that's evidence in my latest case.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.136
Yes, I heard what happened, William.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.075
How insidious,

15:01.100 --> 15:03.205
abducting a child and
implicating you in some way.

15:03.235 --> 15:07.615
Veronica Bowden's mother
is a patient of mine.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.916
I was relieved to hear
that the girl was unharmed,

15:09.942 --> 15:11.785
but I wanted to see how you were faring.

15:11.810 --> 15:15.314
Oh, I'm fine.

15:15.347 --> 15:18.385
That's very kind of you to ask.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.761
Yes, well...

15:22.087 --> 15:23.395
It was good to see you.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.333
Yes.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.331
Actually, Julia,

15:30.362 --> 15:31.932
if you could spare the time,

15:31.964 --> 15:34.706
I'd very much like your input on something.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.919
- Crabtree.
- Sir?

15:41.941 --> 15:44.251
How do you think Murdoch's
handling all this?

15:44.276 --> 15:46.517
Well, he seems his usual self, sir.

15:46.545 --> 15:49.185
Perhaps a bit more on edge than usual.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.592
I think, sir, it helps that
Dr. Ogden's been around.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.961
Mm.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.523
- Speaking of which...
- Go on.

15:56.555 --> 15:58.296
Well, sir, I know it's
not my place to say so,

15:58.324 --> 16:00.361
but it's always puzzled me

16:00.392 --> 16:02.099
as to why Detective Murdoch and Dr. Ogden

16:02.127 --> 16:03.868
have never been able to...

16:03.896 --> 16:07.275
I mean, here are two people;
They're both so learned,

16:07.299 --> 16:09.370
both so perfectly suited for each other.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.711
I'm sure this Dr. Garland is a fine chap,

16:11.737 --> 16:15.014
but-l don't know- it
just breaks my heart, sir.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.280
Matters of the heart are
not always simple, Crabtree.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.018
But this one seems
simple enough to me, sir.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.992
I'm sure Dr. Ogden left
her post here at our morgue

16:23.015 --> 16:24.016
because of it all.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.290
People make choices.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.161
They've made the wrong choice.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.632
Perhaps you should stop fretting

16:29.655 --> 16:31.328
about Murdoch's lost love life, Crabtree,

16:31.357 --> 16:34.092
and concentrate on solving this case.

16:34.093 --> 16:37.973
What kind of person would use
a children's toy to taunt you?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.341
It's an unsettling tactic, I must admit.

16:40.366 --> 16:41.640
And to what end?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.547
No threats have been
directed at you, have they?

16:43.569 --> 16:45.742
Not as yet.

16:45.771 --> 16:49.184
Let's face it, William, you are a target.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.846
Throughout our career together,

16:50.876 --> 16:54.323
you sent many men and
a few women to prison,

16:54.346 --> 16:56.690
some to the end of a rope.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.695
A simple act of revenge.

16:58.717 --> 17:02.028
I suppose it's possible,
but the question is who.

17:02.054 --> 17:04.829
Can you think of any case
that would inspire someone

17:04.857 --> 17:07.666
to seek this kind of retribution?

17:07.693 --> 17:10.002
Not off the top of my head, I'm afraid.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.066
But I'll certainly give it some thought.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.771
Hello, William.

17:21.906 --> 17:23.511
William, are you all right?

17:23.541 --> 17:25.078
Yes, I'm fine.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.214
Whoever's playing this game with you,

17:27.246 --> 17:30.227
the attack is psychological.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.923
Whatever I can do to help,
please know I'm here for you.

17:32.951 --> 17:36.023
Thank you, Julia. That's very kind.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.764
I must say, you have been missed.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.969
I take it you and Darcy are well?

17:44.997 --> 17:47.273
Yes, we...

17:52.271 --> 17:54.615
Do take care of yourself, William.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.151
Sir, you have over 90 cases,

18:05.184 --> 18:07.721
and that number simply
pertains to the perpetrators,

18:07.753 --> 18:10.165
to say nothing of
accomplices, family members,

18:10.189 --> 18:12.135
anybody else who might
have a grudge against you,

18:12.157 --> 18:13.727
and the list goes on, I'm sure.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.760
No doubt.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.637
However, we know the suspect to be male,

18:17.663 --> 18:19.609
based on what Veronica Bowden told me,

18:19.631 --> 18:20.974
so perhaps for the time being,

18:20.999 --> 18:23.070
we can eliminate females from the equation.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.342
Sir, I'm not so sure that we can.

18:24.369 --> 18:25.609
Five talking dolls

18:25.637 --> 18:27.480
were purchased by this unknown blonde lady

18:27.506 --> 18:29.008
and delivered to her hotel.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.486
Good point.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.352
Either way, George,

18:32.377 --> 18:35.449
most of the people on this list
are either dead or in prison.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.121
Exactly, sir, which brings us
back to the civilian population

18:38.150 --> 18:40.289
and the idea that our
suspect might be working

18:40.319 --> 18:42.492
on behalf of somebody
that you've incarcerated.

18:44.189 --> 18:48.137
I'm sorry, George, but this isn't helping.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.574
Help me, Detective Murdoch!

19:26.598 --> 19:28.134
I've lost my head!

19:28.167 --> 19:30.204
Can you help me find it?

19:30.235 --> 19:31.646
Help me, Detective Murdoch!

19:31.670 --> 19:33.231
Right, Murdoch, I'm off for the night.

19:33.238 --> 19:36.412
Sir, have a listen to this.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.887
Pay attention to the
sounds in the background.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.748
Help me, Detective Murdoch!

19:42.781 --> 19:44.419
I've lost my head!

19:44.449 --> 19:45.860
Can you help me find it?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.666
- You hear that?
- I hear church bells.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.100
Yes, yes, there are seven chimes,

19:52.124 --> 19:55.003
but beyond the bells,
there's another sound.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.172
Help me, Detective Murdoch!

19:58.197 --> 19:59.267
I've lost my head!

20:00.299 --> 20:01.710
Can you help me find it?

20:01.733 --> 20:02.905
Help me, Detective Murdoch!

20:03.936 --> 20:06.576
- Train whistle.
- Yes.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.516
Definitely a train whistle.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.611
Yes, so what church in Toronto

20:10.642 --> 20:14.647
has a train going by at
7:00 a.m. or 7:00 p.m.?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.427
We have a train to Markham

20:19.451 --> 20:21.761
leaving Union Station at 6:55 p.m.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.199
Right, so a train, once up to speed,

20:24.223 --> 20:26.794
travels approximately 40 miles per hour.

20:26.825 --> 20:31.205
So that's 2/3 of a mile for every minute.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.610
6:55, 6:56, 6:57,

20:35.634 --> 20:40.606
6:58, 6:59, 7:00.

20:40.639 --> 20:42.983
He was blowing his
whistle for this crossing.

20:43.008 --> 20:46.217
St. Jude's church overlooks
the valley right there.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.889
What did the rector say?

20:53.919 --> 20:56.229
He always keeps it
locked, unless he's here.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.791
Any signs of a break-in?

20:57.823 --> 20:59.769
No, but that's not to say

20:59.791 --> 21:01.134
that he didn't make the recording

21:01.159 --> 21:02.433
without his knowledge.

21:03.528 --> 21:04.802
There goes the train.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.570
Sir, it occurs to me

21:09.601 --> 21:11.979
that if we were inside right now,

21:12.004 --> 21:14.450
we wouldn't hear the train.

21:14.473 --> 21:17.579
You think he made the recording outside.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.453
Well, no, that would
have required electricity.

21:21.613 --> 21:25.026
Oh, bloody hell.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.927
What the bloody hell is that, Murdoch?

21:26.952 --> 21:29.762
Automatic sprinklers, sir, a new invention.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.632
Huh, well, I don't think that'll catch on.

21:34.226 --> 21:38.834
Sir, these sprinklers would need a pump.

21:38.864 --> 21:41.504
And a pump requires electricity.

21:55.847 --> 21:57.485
It's unlocked, sir.

22:08.226 --> 22:10.433
It's like a bloody tomb down here.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.010
Oh, my God.

22:37.789 --> 22:40.201
You found me, Detective Murdoch.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.227
But who am I?

22:49.534 --> 22:51.536
Oh. m'!-

22:51.570 --> 22:53.675
A resident of Sleepy Hollow?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.446
Ichabod Crane, perhaps.

22:55.474 --> 22:57.613
At any rate, our first priority

22:57.642 --> 23:00.282
will be to find any identifying features.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.918
Aren't you curious to
know how the victim died?

23:02.948 --> 23:05.087
I can hazard a guess.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.620
But by all means, Doctor, continue.

23:07.652 --> 23:10.292
Note the blood spatter on the shoes.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.098
That suggests arterial spray.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.968
His heart was still beating?

23:14.993 --> 23:19.100
The victim's head was removed
while he was still alive,

23:19.131 --> 23:20.633
from the right side,

23:20.665 --> 23:23.976
with what looks to have
been a fine-tooth saw.

23:24.002 --> 23:26.608
Clearly there was anger at work here.

23:26.638 --> 23:29.448
- A revenge killing?
- Possibly.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.389
No rings.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.120
His hands look young, well-manicured.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.559
And he's finely dressed.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.653
He was
well-to-do.

23:39.684 --> 23:41.891
I will know more after the post-mortem.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.764
Thank you. I have to take finger marks.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.831
I hate finger-mark duty.

23:50.862 --> 23:53.308
Detective work isn't always
about investigating, Henry.

23:53.331 --> 23:56.437
Sometimes it involves mind-numbing tedium.

23:56.468 --> 23:59.847
I wouldn't mind so much
if it wasn't so futile.

23:59.871 --> 24:00.849
Futile?

24:00.872 --> 24:02.977
Henry, these finger marks
could identify our victim,

24:03.008 --> 24:04.851
which puts us one step
closer to identifying

24:04.876 --> 24:07.152
whoever's been tormenting
Detective Murdoch.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.989
But who's to say the victim's
finger marks are even on file?

24:10.015 --> 24:12.359
I mean, most people
aren't criminals, George.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.488
True.

24:13.518 --> 24:16.522
However, those most likely
to get their heads sawed off

24:16.555 --> 24:17.932
are probably in league

24:17.956 --> 24:19.867
with those inclined to do the sawing,

24:19.891 --> 24:22.303
who are, ipso facto, criminals.

24:22.327 --> 24:24.603
I can't think of one instance

24:24.629 --> 24:26.302
that we've discovered someone's identity

24:26.331 --> 24:27.491
by going through these files.

24:27.499 --> 24:29.672
- We do it all the time.
- Do we?

24:29.701 --> 24:31.442
Because it's my recollection

24:31.470 --> 24:33.507
that we do this until our eyes fall out,

24:33.538 --> 24:35.540
and then Detective Murdoch
comes Waltzing in here

24:35.574 --> 24:37.451
and says, "Check
on so-and-so,"

24:37.476 --> 24:39.114
and, lo and behold, he's our man.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.215
Detective Murdoch doesn't waltz, Henry.

24:41.246 --> 24:44.148
Believe me, I've seen him try.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.492
Sawed his head off, did he?

24:45.517 --> 24:47.463
Bloody hell, this boy plays rough.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.399
Yes, "plays" seems to be
the operative word, sir.

24:50.422 --> 24:53.460
The dolls, the childlike voice recordings-

24:53.492 --> 24:55.563
he's trying to get under my skin.

24:55.594 --> 24:56.595
Is it working?

24:58.196 --> 24:59.470
File this please, Irving.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.535
- Detective.
- Dr. Grace.

25:01.566 --> 25:03.876
The headless victim has no birthmarks,

25:03.902 --> 25:05.643
no deformities, no scars.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.480
Any identifying features not
accompanied by the word "no"?

25:08.507 --> 25:09.508
No.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.211
What can you tell me about him?

25:12.244 --> 25:14.246
His musculature was underdeveloped,

25:14.279 --> 25:17.226
which suggests youth and
freedom from physical labor.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.819
A young toff.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.761
So how come we've not heard about it, then?

25:20.785 --> 25:22.196
One of theirs goes missing,

25:22.220 --> 25:24.826
we generally find out about it soon enough.

25:24.856 --> 25:25.926
Thank you, Doctor.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.333
Sir, this latest doll,

25:31.363 --> 25:33.172
it's different from the other two.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.370
Different how?

25:34.399 --> 25:38.575
The voice is higher-pitched
and seems more rushed.

25:38.603 --> 25:40.105
See for yourself, sir.

25:40.138 --> 25:42.209
Listen.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.379
Hello, Detective Murdoch.

25:44.409 --> 25:47.686
Will you play with me?

25:47.712 --> 25:51.057
The recording is different
than the other dolls.

25:51.082 --> 25:52.288
Listen.

25:52.317 --> 25:54.627
You found me, Detective Murdoch.

25:54.653 --> 25:57.361
But who am I?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.062
So you think it's someone else?

25:59.090 --> 26:03.903
No, the voice is the same,
but the tone is different,

26:03.929 --> 26:06.933
and the cadence is off somehow.

26:06.965 --> 26:08.603
The words are clipped,

26:08.633 --> 26:11.409
as if it was recorded at a slower speed

26:11.436 --> 26:14.440
and then sped up somehow.

26:14.472 --> 26:17.282
You found me, Detective Murdoch.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.755
But who am I?

26:24.349 --> 26:27.796
You found me, Detective Murdoch.

26:29.087 --> 26:32.000
What is it?

26:32.023 --> 26:33.502
I've heard that voice.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.004
When? Where?

26:35.026 --> 26:38.303
But who am I?

26:41.700 --> 26:43.680
L
- I can't place it.

26:43.702 --> 26:45.682
Take a break for a bit. It'll come to you.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.945
It's like when someone's name
is on the tip of your tongue.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.078
No, sir, it's not that sort of thing.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.247
It's not a voice I'm familiar with

26:52.277 --> 26:53.312
and can't recall.

26:53.345 --> 26:56.656
It's... it's more distant than that.

26:56.681 --> 26:59.457
- A voice from your past?
- Yes.

26:59.484 --> 27:01.964
- From your childhood?
- No.

27:01.987 --> 27:06.333
No, more recent
- years, not decades.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.962
You know what you need, Murdoch?

27:07.993 --> 27:10.997
A nice quiet sit-down with
your favorite head doctor.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.339
Dr. Roberts?

27:13.365 --> 27:16.369
As we know, he has a unique
way of unlocking the mind.

27:17.902 --> 27:20.143
You are floating,

27:20.171 --> 27:22.708
free from every constraint,

27:22.741 --> 27:27.190
released from the bounds of time and space.

27:27.212 --> 27:30.216
You have no body.

27:30.248 --> 27:34.458
Can you feel the chair beneath you?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.056
No.

27:36.087 --> 27:38.658
You are going to hear a voice.

27:38.690 --> 27:42.467
You found me, Detective Murdoch.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.340
But who am I?

27:46.364 --> 27:48.674
This man is talking to you.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.373
Do you know him?

27:52.704 --> 27:54.547
No.

27:54.572 --> 27:56.779
Who is it? Do you know?

28:01.046 --> 28:03.026
Where are you?

28:03.048 --> 28:05.153
Where are you when you hear the voice?

28:05.183 --> 28:06.355
What do you see?

28:06.384 --> 28:09.524
You found me, Detective Murdoch.

28:09.554 --> 28:11.693
- Trees.
- But who am I?

28:11.723 --> 28:14.203
Grass.

28:14.225 --> 28:15.863
Are you in the park?

28:18.229 --> 28:21.369
No. No, there are buildings.

28:21.399 --> 28:24.937
Who do you see?

28:24.969 --> 28:26.880
Young people.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.584
They're hurrying,

28:30.608 --> 28:32.349
carrying books.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.220
You're at school.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.593
Not my school.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.599
You found me, Detective Murdoch.

28:48.626 --> 28:51.664
But who am I?

28:53.898 --> 28:56.105
Turn around, Detective.

28:56.134 --> 28:57.704
Look around.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.273
Who do you see?

29:05.276 --> 29:08.485
- Detective, James Gillies.
- Robert Perry.

29:08.513 --> 29:10.618
We were students of Professor Bennett's.

29:10.648 --> 29:13.390
- It wasn't my idea.
- Shut up, you fool.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.159
You tried to kill me.

29:15.186 --> 29:16.665
No, I didn't.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.759
Whatever they said, it was a trick.

29:18.790 --> 29:22.602
Who is it, Detective?

29:22.627 --> 29:25.801
James Gillies.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.104
Good.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.375
Very good.

29:37.609 --> 29:40.283
I've got it. Higgins, I've got it.

29:40.311 --> 29:42.655
I've identified our
victim. It's Robert Perry.

29:42.680 --> 29:43.784
Do you remember this?

29:43.815 --> 29:44.953
He and an associate of his

29:44.983 --> 29:46.758
killed a university professor a while back.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.763
I do remember it.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.767
- George.
- Sir, our headless victim...

29:50.789 --> 29:53.668
I believe it's the body of Robert Perry.

29:53.691 --> 29:54.669
Oh, and, George,

29:54.692 --> 29:57.104
please look into the
status of James Gillies

29:57.128 --> 29:58.607
at Kingston Penitentiary.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.973
- Sir.
- Thank you.

29:59.998 --> 30:01.636
Surprised, George?

30:01.666 --> 30:03.839
No, I suppose not.

30:03.868 --> 30:05.814
I remember this arrogant little bastard

30:05.837 --> 30:08.613
and his pal Robert Perry.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.642
Perry made a nice deal, I seem to recall.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.211
Yes, only two years in prison

30:12.243 --> 30:14.849
in exchange for testimony
against James Gillies.

30:14.879 --> 30:16.950
Gillies was sentenced
to be hanged, was he not?

30:16.981 --> 30:18.619
- Yes.
- So how's he doing this, then?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.960
He would have to be near the church

30:20.985 --> 30:22.191
to make the recordings,

30:22.220 --> 30:23.665
and yet he's in prison.

30:23.688 --> 30:25.969
Unless he has an accomplice
carrying out his dirty work.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.060
Seems to be his pattern.

30:27.091 --> 30:28.536
What have you, George?

30:28.560 --> 30:30.801
I was just on the telephone
with Kingston Penitentiary.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.503
Apparently James Gillies
was executed three weeks ago.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.670
- Executed?
- Hanged by the neck until dead.

30:35.700 --> 30:36.821
And according to his family,

30:36.835 --> 30:38.396
he was buried here in Toronto last week.

30:38.403 --> 30:40.076
Well, he didn't rise from the grave.

30:40.104 --> 30:42.673
Let's make sure of that.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.528
We're there, sir.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.467
Already?

31:10.268 --> 31:12.441
It's a miniature casket.

31:12.470 --> 31:16.077
I don't remember James
Gillies being dwarfish.

31:16.107 --> 31:17.381
Bring it up.

31:32.457 --> 31:35.233
There's something else.

31:35.260 --> 31:36.466
Keep digging-

31:50.742 --> 31:52.744
Is that James Gillies?

31:52.777 --> 31:54.085
I don't know, George.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.582
He was clean-shaven last time I saw him.

31:57.615 --> 31:58.958
Let's get his body to the morgue.

31:58.983 --> 32:00.428
Sir.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.172
George?

32:23.308 --> 32:25.618
Please stop. No, don't!

32:25.643 --> 32:27.816
William, please help me!

32:27.845 --> 32:29.449
That's Julia.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.484
George, he has Julia.

32:38.156 --> 32:40.636
Please stop. No, don't!

32:40.658 --> 32:42.001
William, please help me!

32:42.026 --> 32:44.165
Dr. Ogden didn't show up
to her clinic this morning,

32:44.195 --> 32:45.799
and no one's seen her since last night.

32:45.830 --> 32:47.036
Where's her husband?

32:47.065 --> 32:49.477
Dr. Garland's on his way back
from a conference in Montreal.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.207
He'll be home in a couple of hours.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.374
I'll deal with informing
him of the situation.

32:53.404 --> 32:55.281
The body we pulled out of the casket

32:55.306 --> 32:56.979
was not that of James Gillies.

32:57.008 --> 32:59.852
So who was it, then?

32:59.877 --> 33:00.855
And how did he end up

33:00.878 --> 33:02.398
at the end of a rope meant for Gillies?

33:02.413 --> 33:05.792
Please stop. No, don't!

33:05.817 --> 33:06.989
William, please help me!

33:07.018 --> 33:08.379
I don't think you'll get anything

33:08.386 --> 33:09.524
off this recording, Murdoch.

33:09.554 --> 33:10.624
It's too noisy.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.965
Yes, there appears to
be the sound of a motor

33:12.991 --> 33:14.493
in the distant background.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.971
But beyond that, there's another sound.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.976
It occurs at the beginning
and repeats twice.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.309
Please stop. No, don't!

33:23.334 --> 33:25.075
William, please help me!

33:25.103 --> 33:26.673
I can barely hear anything.

33:26.704 --> 33:27.705
I can.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.912
There's a clue here somewhere.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.545
Gillies has left nothing to chance.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.180
But what is it about this recording

33:33.211 --> 33:34.747
he wants me to find?

33:34.779 --> 33:37.419
I think you're wasting your time, Murdoch.

33:37.448 --> 33:40.588
Sir, sounds seldom repeat themselves.

33:40.618 --> 33:43.827
Now, if I can eliminate
the foreground noise,

33:43.855 --> 33:46.028
then perhaps I can identify it.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.697
Is that possible?

33:48.726 --> 33:53.835
Sir, a motor turns at
a fixed rate of speed.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.538
That means the whine of the motor

33:55.566 --> 33:59.173
will oscillate at a fixed frequency.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.843
Now, if I can create a standing wave

34:01.873 --> 34:08.255
180 degrees out of phase with that wave,

34:08.279 --> 34:10.589
then the two waves will
cancel each other out,

34:10.614 --> 34:13.027
and the net amplitude of
that frequency will be zero.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.964
In plain English, Murdoch,
what would all that get us?

34:15.987 --> 34:16.987
A clean recording!

34:19.257 --> 34:22.397
And possibly a clue as to
Dr. Ogden's whereabouts.

34:24.462 --> 34:25.940
Constable Worsley,

34:25.963 --> 34:28.534
Alexander Graham Bell is
staying at the Queen's Hotel.

34:28.565 --> 34:29.636
I need him to come here

34:29.667 --> 34:31.112
and to bring his audiograph with him.

34:31.135 --> 34:32.909
Please hurry. It's an emergency.

34:32.937 --> 34:34.712
'Sir?

34:34.739 --> 34:37.150
Dr. Grace is here to see you.
And when you have a moment-

34:37.175 --> 34:38.882
- I'll be right with you, George.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.889
Dr. Grace, do you have an update?

34:40.911 --> 34:42.585
Yes, the man in the casket

34:42.612 --> 34:44.922
had an advanced brain tumor
in the left temporal lobe.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.621
But from what I can determine so far,

34:46.650 --> 34:48.722
the tumor was not lethal
in its current stage.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.164
But he was dying from it, yes?

34:50.188 --> 34:52.134
Yes, a painful, slow way to go.

34:52.156 --> 34:53.998
Thank you, Doctor. What
do you have, George?

34:54.025 --> 34:56.301
Sir, I spoke to the warden
at Kingston Penitentiary.

34:56.327 --> 34:58.432
He's surprised that James
Gillies escaped the noose,

34:58.463 --> 34:59.601
but he thinks he knows how.

34:59.630 --> 35:00.631
How?

35:00.665 --> 35:02.235
In the months prior to Gillies' death,

35:02.266 --> 35:04.177
he grew a beard, much like
one of the guards there,

35:04.202 --> 35:05.408
a Robert Shoucair.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.279
Apparently the two looked almost identical.

35:07.305 --> 35:08.283
Where is this guard?

35:08.306 --> 35:10.081
Well, he resigned due to health problems.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.850
- When was he discharged?
- October 4th.

35:12.877 --> 35:13.912
The very same day

35:13.945 --> 35:15.652
that James Gillies was supposedly hanged.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.819
Now, he has a widow that
lives just up on Dundas Street.

35:17.849 --> 35:18.850
I'd like to speak with her.

35:18.883 --> 35:20.419
Sir, I've asked someone to fetch her.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.657
Very good, George. Thank you.

35:21.686 --> 35:22.960
Good work, Crabtree.

35:24.355 --> 35:26.164
We didn't know what to do.

35:26.190 --> 35:28.500
I was-l am with child,

35:28.526 --> 35:31.996
and the doctor told Bobby he
had less than a year to live.

35:32.029 --> 35:36.102
He was hurting, and it
was only getting worse.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.047
So your husband made a deal.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.310
Yes.

35:40.338 --> 35:43.717
I didn't like it, but we
knew he was going to die.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.350
How much money did Mr. Gillies give you?

35:49.046 --> 35:50.491
$3,000 in cash.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.721
You're not gonna take it, are you?

35:53.751 --> 35:55.230
My husband died for that money.

35:55.253 --> 35:57.961
I'm not going to confiscate
your money, Mrs. Shoucair.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.731
I just need to know how you received it.

36:00.758 --> 36:02.032
Did you meet Mr. Gillies?

36:02.059 --> 36:04.505
No.

36:04.529 --> 36:07.135
His wife brought it to me in a suitcase.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.202
His wife?

36:09.233 --> 36:10.507
Yes, is that strange?

36:10.535 --> 36:13.573
Insofar as Mr. Gillies never married.

36:13.604 --> 36:16.346
What did this woman look like?

36:16.374 --> 36:19.753
Tall, not very attractive.

36:19.777 --> 36:21.882
Done up like a doxy, if you ask me.

36:23.848 --> 36:24.918
Hello, William.

36:24.949 --> 36:26.587
She had blonde hair.

36:29.887 --> 36:32.424
George, you interviewed a woman earlier-

36:32.456 --> 36:34.333
blonde hair, heavily rouged,

36:34.358 --> 36:35.996
lives near Veronica Bowden's home.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.200
- Ms. James.
- Yes, what's her address?

36:40.865 --> 36:43.869
It's right here, sir, Ms. Gillian James.

36:43.901 --> 36:46.006
Gillian James?

36:46.037 --> 36:48.347
James Gillies.

36:48.372 --> 36:51.046
399 Berkeley Street.

36:51.075 --> 36:54.284
It's the Empire Hotel, where
we found the little girl.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.419
I'm going in.

37:01.452 --> 37:03.295
Sir, you should wait.
There are more men on the-

37:03.321 --> 37:04.766
He has Julia.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.467
Detective Murdoch, please come in.

37:11.495 --> 37:12.473
Where is she?

37:12.496 --> 37:13.975
You thought I was gonna tell you?

37:13.998 --> 37:17.605
Oh, Detective, you are
wasting such precious time.

37:17.635 --> 37:20.138
You should have tried to find her, not me.

37:20.171 --> 37:26.417
I'm afraid Dr. Ogden only
has less than an hour to live.

37:26.444 --> 37:29.084
- Where is she?
- Sir!

37:29.113 --> 37:30.956
Do you really think you'd be here

37:30.982 --> 37:33.087
if I hadn't led you here?

37:33.117 --> 37:35.063
Think, Detective.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.929
I wanted you to find me.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.456
Why?

37:38.489 --> 37:40.093
So I could watch

37:40.124 --> 37:43.264
as you lost the thing you
love most in this world.

37:43.294 --> 37:45.331
Don't deny it.

37:51.535 --> 37:54.414
You really are wasting time, Detective.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.179
How much time do I have?

37:56.207 --> 37:58.244
37 minutes by my calculations,

37:58.276 --> 38:00.950
less if she loses faith
you'll find her in time.

38:00.978 --> 38:02.787
You mean if she panics.

38:02.813 --> 38:04.315
You've rigged some sort of device

38:04.348 --> 38:05.850
to be triggered by her heart rate.

38:05.883 --> 38:07.260
Oh, I like that.

38:07.285 --> 38:11.131
I almost wish I had done it, but no.

38:11.155 --> 38:12.259
You know what's funny?

38:12.290 --> 38:14.133
Well, I guess you won't
find it that amusing,

38:14.158 --> 38:16.604
but you will appreciate the
irony when you discover it.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.800
Discover what?

38:18.829 --> 38:21.207
That it was you who killed her.

38:21.232 --> 38:23.178
You were so hell-bent on finding me,

38:23.200 --> 38:24.838
you sealed her fate.

38:24.869 --> 38:26.149
Of course, I knew you'd do that.

38:26.170 --> 38:31.051
You're so predictable.
It's really not fair.

38:31.075 --> 38:33.055
Tell you what, Detective. Here's a hint.

38:33.077 --> 38:36.718
You already have all the
clues you need to find her.

38:36.747 --> 38:38.283
The question is,

38:38.316 --> 38:40.922
are you smart enough to
figure it out in time?

38:42.186 --> 38:45.463
- Where is she?
- This is fun.

38:45.489 --> 38:48.333
Whoa, Murdoch. Hey, leave him.

38:48.359 --> 38:51.306
Your friend Alexander Graham Bell is here.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.603
Go.

38:57.201 --> 39:01.377
Now, then, laughing boy,

39:01.405 --> 39:04.682
let's see if we can't fix
that smile of yours, eh?

39:08.512 --> 39:09.752
- Mr. Bell.
- Ah.

39:09.780 --> 39:10.918
Thank you.

39:10.948 --> 39:12.552
Yes, I came as quick as I could, Murdoch.

39:12.583 --> 39:13.823
How can I help?

39:13.851 --> 39:17.060
Have a listen to this.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.728
Please stop. No, don't!

39:19.757 --> 39:22.567
William, please help me!

39:22.593 --> 39:25.005
- My goodness.
- Yes.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.009
There's a sound that
repeats in the background,

39:27.031 --> 39:29.272
but it's obscured by the
sound of a motor running.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.370
Yes.

39:30.401 --> 39:32.608
I want to eliminate the sound of the motor.

39:32.636 --> 39:35.446
Then we need to determine
the motor's audio frequency.

39:35.473 --> 39:36.543
Exactly.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.451
Well, let's get to work, shall we?

39:38.476 --> 39:40.786
Is this still fun?

39:40.811 --> 39:43.348
Or maybe you'd rather talk.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.383
Tell me where Dr. Ogden is.

39:45.416 --> 39:48.022
I believe I have a right to a barrister.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.700
I have a right too.

39:51.722 --> 39:52.894
And a left.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.537
Please stop. No, don't!

40:05.569 --> 40:07.708
William, please help me!

40:07.738 --> 40:09.115
Yes, yes.

40:09.140 --> 40:10.949
The frequency of the foreground noise

40:10.975 --> 40:14.479
appears to be at 2,000
oscillations per second.

40:14.512 --> 40:17.721
Make a minor adjustment.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.324
- William, please
help me! - Ah, mm-hmm.

40:22.353 --> 40:24.333
Right, and we know that sound travels

40:24.355 --> 40:26.392
at 1,125 feet per second.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.233
Yes.

40:28.259 --> 40:35.143
So if we take 1,125 into 2,000..

40:35.166 --> 40:38.010
625...

40:38.035 --> 40:42.279
6.75 times 1...

40:42.306 --> 40:43.478
1.5...

40:43.507 --> 40:46.317
Equals...75...

40:46.343 --> 40:49.847
10.125 inches.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.417
Let's calibrate the reflectors.

40:59.657 --> 41:01.466
A little more.

41:07.231 --> 41:08.471
No, no, too much.

41:08.499 --> 41:10.376
Go back.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.013
Back, back, back.

41:15.039 --> 41:16.040
Stop!

41:17.508 --> 41:20.114
Hmm.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.215
That's as good as we're gonna get it.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.124
Please stop. No, don't!

41:30.354 --> 41:31.662
William, please help me!

41:33.557 --> 41:35.537
I've heard that sound before.

41:35.559 --> 41:36.970
Where?

41:43.033 --> 41:44.512
The cemetery.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.845
37 minutes by my calculations,

41:46.871 --> 41:49.545
less if she loses faith
you'll find her in time.

41:49.573 --> 41:52.315
There were two fresh graves.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.947
Help!

41:57.014 --> 41:59.324
He's buried her alive.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.235
You already have all the
clues you need to find her.

42:08.259 --> 42:11.172
Help!

42:11.195 --> 42:13.539
William, help! Help!

42:13.564 --> 42:15.237
You were so hell-bent on finding me,

42:15.266 --> 42:16.939
you sealed her fate.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.050
Here! Start digging!

42:28.646 --> 42:30.751
William, help!

42:34.418 --> 42:36.762
' Quickly!

42:36.787 --> 42:38.926
She's running out of air.

42:55.172 --> 42:58.619
Julia. God, please.

42:58.642 --> 42:59.950
William.

42:59.977 --> 43:02.321
It's all right. You're with me now.

43:04.181 --> 43:05.990
I'm so sorry.

43:06.016 --> 43:09.554
What took you so long?

43:21.265 --> 43:24.178
Mr. Gillies.

43:24.201 --> 43:26.681
Nicely played, Detective Murdoch.

43:26.704 --> 43:28.581
Looks like you win again.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.916
I'm going to watch you
hang in person this time,

43:30.941 --> 43:31.942
Mr. Gillies.

43:31.976 --> 43:33.546
I'm flattered.

43:34.878 --> 43:36.653
Why do this?

43:36.680 --> 43:39.183
You could have walked away a free man.

43:39.216 --> 43:41.025
I don't like to be bested.

43:41.051 --> 43:44.032
You beat me the first
time. I wanted a rematch.

43:44.054 --> 43:46.864
Well, the game is good and over now.

43:46.890 --> 43:50.929
But I am curious
- why Veronica Bowden?

43:50.961 --> 43:53.771
Of all the girls in the
city, why kidnap her?

43:53.797 --> 43:56.607
Her house is where I grew up.
They never changed the locks.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.511
If you'd have simply checked the records,

43:58.535 --> 43:59.843
you'd have figured that out,

43:59.870 --> 44:03.010
but I knew you'd over think it all.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.042
Your genius will be your undoing.

44:05.075 --> 44:06.611
Yours as well, Mr. Gillies,

44:06.644 --> 44:09.716
perhaps sooner than you might like.

44:12.383 --> 44:13.657
Driver.

44:27.598 --> 44:29.635
I'm completely fine, William.

44:29.667 --> 44:33.012
You almost died because of me.

44:33.037 --> 44:35.039
You can't blame yourself

44:35.072 --> 44:37.177
for the actions of a deranged criminal.

44:37.207 --> 44:38.208
And Darcy?

44:38.242 --> 44:41.018
He must find me at fault to some degree.

44:43.414 --> 44:45.223
He's admittedly curious to know

44:45.249 --> 44:47.024
why someone would seek their revenge on you

44:47.051 --> 44:48.997
by endangering me.

44:49.019 --> 44:54.765
And if I may ask, what did you tell him?

44:54.792 --> 44:56.271
The truth:

44:56.293 --> 44:59.240
That somehow Mr. Gillies knew

44:59.263 --> 45:03.268
how much we meant to one another-

45:03.300 --> 45:06.042
our history, working together,

45:06.070 --> 45:07.549
and our friendship.

45:07.571 --> 45:11.280
And I apologize for putting that at risk.

45:12.910 --> 45:16.551
Never again do I want
to feel such desperation.

45:18.716 --> 45:22.926
Do you know how I survived?

45:22.953 --> 45:26.059
I knew you'd come, William.

45:26.090 --> 45:29.435
Even if you had to move
heaven and Earth to do it,

45:29.460 --> 45:32.100
I knew you'd find me.

45:45.843 --> 45:49.620
Detective? This arrived for you.

45:49.646 --> 45:52.149
It was mailed yesterday, no return address.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.960
A final gift from James Gillies.

46:01.992 --> 46:04.268
So it would seem.

46:04.294 --> 46:05.568
Murdoch.

46:05.596 --> 46:08.475
Just had word from the
Durham County Police.

46:08.499 --> 46:10.979
Apparently the jail wagon
transporting James Gillies

46:11.001 --> 46:13.311
overturned on the Rouge River Bridge.

46:13.337 --> 46:15.749
The whole wagon plunged
into the river below.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.184
Guard and driver were both killed.

46:17.207 --> 46:19.983
And James Gillies?

46:20.010 --> 46:21.853
They haven't been able to find his body.

46:28.018 --> 46:31.761
Detective Murdoch, I hope
you enjoyed our reunion,

46:31.789 --> 46:34.770
but I do wonder when we'll meet again.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.466
Until the next time.

46:37.494 --> 46:38.802
So he's alive?

46:40.964 --> 46:43.877
I think it's safe to assume that he's...

46:46.737 --> 46:48.307
I don't know.
