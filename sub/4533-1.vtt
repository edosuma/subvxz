ANGEL 
Review by Angel.

01:13.660 --> 01:18.660
<i>"She is brave. They say
is within the city".</i>

01:18.792 --> 01:23.485
<i>"Close doors and windows before
she to get in."</i>

01:36.429 --> 01:41.424
<i>"She is out there
in the shadows."</i>

01:41.908 --> 01:46.473
<i>"You can sleep. Do not care
about anything good."</i>

01:50.608 --> 01:54.376
<i>"It comes with a candle
look at her in bed."</i>

01:54.719 --> 01:58.605
<i>"Come with scissors
to cut your head."</i>

02:21.594 --> 02:23.594
<i>Nobody can open the door.</i>

02:27.374 --> 02:30.061
Okay. Right. I will.
For the God's sake.

02:34.971 --> 02:37.194
Can I play with Jenny? Please.

02:37.769 --> 02:39.644
She...

02:40.299 --> 02:41.977
She cannot. Dear.

02:42.301 --> 02:45.630
- Jenny is not longer here.
- Yes. She is.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.079
I am sorry. Honey.

02:48.690 --> 02:52.485
- Jenny went to heaven.
- No. She was not. She is dead.

02:53.345 --> 02:55.988
Can I come in?
To look at your body.

02:56.295 --> 02:58.477
I want to play with it.

03:19.796 --> 03:21.196
Iris?

03:23.796 --> 03:25.196
Iris?

03:27.944 --> 03:30.418
Can we talk about Little Angel?

03:30.420 --> 03:32.713
Frankly. I heard the
neighbors talking...

03:56.695 --> 04:00.100

05:21.866 --> 05:24.553
BASED ON THE BOOK "CORE OF EVIL"
OF NIGEL MCCREY

05:32.840 --> 05:35.891
15 YEARS LATER

05:58.448 --> 06:01.951
What a pity!
It is a wonderful day!

06:49.983 --> 06:51.539
I am home.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.366
<i>I thought you had lost.</i>

07:02.590 --> 07:05.040
I bought some food
packed for lunch.

07:05.064 --> 07:07.172
Just put in the microwave oven.

07:07.174 --> 07:08.925
Before forget.

07:09.555 --> 07:12.447
They charged the board.
I paid the bill.

07:12.449 --> 07:13.837
I signed.

07:13.839 --> 07:16.503
I took $ 20 for
pay the gas bill.

07:16.505 --> 07:17.920
Thank you. Honey.

07:18.484 --> 07:21.134
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- I would kill for a cup.

07:22.938 --> 07:25.984
<i>- How is your leg? Violet</i>
- Something is wrong.

07:26.282 --> 07:28.622
<i>I will trade the bonds later
If you want.</i>

07:28.624 --> 07:30.296
It would be wonderful. Honey.

07:30.298 --> 07:32.695
I do not know what I would
do without you.

07:35.218 --> 07:37.524
I want to show you
something special.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.356
Who is she?

07:43.021 --> 07:44.532
<i>It is my mother.</i>

07:46.884 --> 07:48.679
She is wonderful!

07:49.823 --> 07:53.235
Do you have mentioned it before?
What is your name?

07:54.227 --> 07:55.627
Rebecca.

07:57.413 --> 07:59.704
She used to be a singer in
meetings.

08:00.446 --> 08:02.413
She might be famous.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.455
However, she died
when I was little.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.149
What is wrong? Honey.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.284
I am very happy. It is all.

08:17.231 --> 08:22.231
Since mom died.
I never had a family.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.133
A true home.

08:25.869 --> 08:28.158
My dear!

08:28.160 --> 08:31.208
Now you have me. As a family.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.200
I want you to think of me
as your grandmother.

08:34.928 --> 08:37.147
Only you and me.

08:55.566 --> 08:57.207
Sir. We can talk.

09:00.214 --> 09:02.114
Let us for five minutes. Please!

09:10.045 --> 09:13.012
Blunt. We have a problem.

09:18.733 --> 09:21.007
<i>A pattern emerged.</i>

09:21.009 --> 09:23.326
<i>This is the third murder.</i>

09:23.790 --> 09:25.858
<i>It is a little girl. David.</i>

09:29.691 --> 09:32.369
- Are you sure of it?
- DNA confirmed.

09:33.784 --> 09:35.985
I thought we settled this.

09:36.823 --> 09:38.594
Of course not.

09:39.617 --> 09:43.729
This is what I believed for a
time. For God's sake.

09:43.731 --> 09:48.469
Understand that it is extremely
sensitive complicated scenario.

09:48.471 --> 09:49.871
Really?

09:51.929 --> 09:54.375
It is very serious, David.

09:55.492 --> 09:56.973
That demanded more resources.

09:56.975 --> 09:59.460
Means appeal to old favors.

10:00.452 --> 10:03.936
And you have to use agents
from outside.

10:09.510 --> 10:11.483
You do what must have done.

10:12.031 --> 10:13.431
Make it disappear.

10:16.379 --> 10:19.032
<i>Colima lost contact
with Al-Qaeda.</i>

10:19.738 --> 10:21.988
He took the money and not
delivered the goods.

10:22.012 --> 10:24.881
- So. What is the new?
- They want his dead.

10:25.762 --> 10:27.162
He did not give the minimum.

10:27.482 --> 10:30.332
Therefore, it is just a matter
of time until they capture.

10:30.356 --> 10:32.107
We need to keep him alive.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.440
Bring him in for questioning.

10:42.363 --> 10:44.367
They are serious people. Colima.

10:45.230 --> 10:46.930
You do not want to
mess with them.

10:48.284 --> 10:51.139
Listen!
We do not want an accident.

10:55.417 --> 10:57.067
<i>Why were you sent to us.</i>

10:57.069 --> 10:59.940
I mean. You are a friendly
person. Who are you?

11:01.409 --> 11:03.290
Specializing in Nazi.

11:03.292 --> 11:07.993
10 years as a sniper. 5 years
In the Analysis System 13.

11:07.995 --> 11:12.251
Joint operations.
Delta Force. Triple Special.

11:12.253 --> 11:13.253
Secret operations.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.105
Just the same thing. Truly.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.009
Only with another leaders.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.586
<i>Target in sight.
All in position.</i>

11:20.588 --> 11:22.393
Brilliant!

11:25.075 --> 11:28.292
You should not trust in
English. British blessed.

11:28.294 --> 11:32.085
I neither like the British.
They are cursed.

11:41.281 --> 11:43.251
Rahat. Is Junior.

11:43.253 --> 11:45.112
He should not be here.

11:50.821 --> 11:53.303
- Junior. What the hell?
- They forced me to come.

11:53.305 --> 11:55.071
Stay close to me.

12:02.940 --> 12:04.622
Okay. I want to check.

12:05.043 --> 12:06.443
Of course!

12:07.296 --> 12:09.124
First. You show me the money.

12:09.126 --> 12:12.494
- I will give you to check.
- Stay there!

12:13.872 --> 12:15.804
- You bring it here.
- What?

12:15.806 --> 12:18.613
No. No way.
It is not part of the deal.

12:18.615 --> 12:20.415
Junior. Everything
will be all right.

12:20.439 --> 12:21.839
Okay.

12:22.115 --> 12:24.298
Just bring the money.
It is all right.

12:34.137 --> 12:35.537
You should go back.

12:42.802 --> 12:45.386
- Junior. Go back to the car.
- He stays here.

12:46.004 --> 12:48.605
- I told: Junior back to the car!
- He stays.

12:48.607 --> 12:50.049
Damn!

12:51.856 --> 12:55.237
All that will do is pick up
ammunition and leave. Right?

12:55.891 --> 12:57.606
I want to check the plastic.

12:59.970 --> 13:01.370
All right?

13:04.534 --> 13:05.934
It is good.

13:05.936 --> 13:06.936
- Put down!
- Go! Go!

13:06.938 --> 13:08.338
Go to hell!

13:27.209 --> 13:29.214
I am sorry about
your friend black.

13:32.907 --> 13:34.601
I am sorry for your teeth.

13:53.926 --> 13:55.515
Violet. I came back.

13:57.033 --> 14:00.283
Brought some beautiful...
Flowers.

14:00.285 --> 14:03.243
Angel. Violet told me
about you.

14:11.774 --> 14:13.289
You are a good girl. Angel.

14:13.291 --> 14:15.879
The next week I will drop by.
See you later!

14:26.527 --> 14:28.898
Old bitch!

14:29.806 --> 14:32.737
You had sex now. You are pig!

14:33.033 --> 14:35.030
What it is wrong?

14:35.133 --> 14:37.030
What it is wrong?

14:37.586 --> 14:40.256
I gave you shit hugs.

14:54.942 --> 14:56.527
Well!

14:56.529 --> 14:59.501
What you do child.

14:59.979 --> 15:02.304
Sorry. Grandma.

15:02.484 --> 15:07.484
If you persist in this way. I
will bury you under the ground.

15:08.198 --> 15:13.133
In the garden. Looking
at your sister.

15:14.216 --> 15:15.616
<i>Now.</i>

15:15.701 --> 15:19.640
I want you out of the tub
Get dressed quickly.

15:19.642 --> 15:24.367
Why does your uncle Tommy
is underway.

15:24.369 --> 15:28.068
With his friends to a party.

15:34.191 --> 15:38.205
- What it is wrong with her?
<i>- She do not want to do anymore.</i>

15:38.207 --> 15:40.833
<i>Told not felt good.</i>

15:42.932 --> 15:45.639
- Very well. Grandma!
- Yes. Tommy.

15:45.641 --> 15:49.797
She became a slut naughty.
Angel.

15:49.799 --> 15:54.799
You think are too good
to the party.

16:00.343 --> 16:01.941
What is the problem with Angel?

16:03.513 --> 16:06.428
A tear the most for her sister.

16:07.822 --> 16:09.411
She was very naughty.

16:10.356 --> 16:12.559
She did what you
have told to do.

16:13.789 --> 16:15.973
Threatened to bring us down.

16:16.530 --> 16:19.920
Angel. You know what happens
to those who accuse Path. No?

16:23.133 --> 16:26.389
You know what happens to
people who accuse Path? Angel.

16:26.391 --> 16:28.360
People who threaten us.

16:29.317 --> 16:32.006
We will cut back
on bloody pieces.

16:33.991 --> 16:37.504
Go inside and make
what needs to be done.

16:37.506 --> 16:42.194
Or we will buried you in
the garden with your sister.

16:56.542 --> 17:01.542
I spoke that wicked priest
all about Angel.

17:04.309 --> 17:07.009
Do you know what happens with
people who accuse us?

17:07.811 --> 17:09.278
Do you know?

17:10.269 --> 17:13.986
We cut your skin
in bloody pieces.

17:31.956 --> 17:35.367
This happens when
messes with the Analysis System.

17:36.198 --> 17:37.598
Screw it.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.683
You are the one who ruined.
Colima.

17:41.348 --> 17:45.978
Murder. Conspiracy.
Selling weapons to terrorists.

17:45.980 --> 17:47.530
We have recorded conversations.

17:47.554 --> 17:49.921
From microphones placed in
their homes and cars.

17:49.923 --> 17:52.182
And really caught
good conversations.

17:54.637 --> 17:56.468
This left here. You know it.

17:57.245 --> 18:00.275
I recommended this for
at least 30 years.

18:01.292 --> 18:02.990
<i>We will do a deal.</i>

18:03.709 --> 18:06.591
I know what people would do
in exchange for what is here.

18:06.593 --> 18:08.686
<i>I know. We will
make an agreement.</i>

18:09.362 --> 18:11.224
Depends on it.

18:11.785 --> 18:14.074
They will be able to
reduce the sentence.

18:14.076 --> 18:17.818
A request for extradition to the
US and who knows else.

18:17.820 --> 18:20.670
<i>Actually. Already has an agreement
with the higher courts.</i>

18:22.306 --> 18:24.661
Can I put you on a ship?
In five minutes.

18:25.869 --> 18:28.913
Screw it. I will
get extradition.

18:32.366 --> 18:34.747
You will be on a plane tonight.

18:34.749 --> 18:38.340
No one will know I put you
a flight. We will not mind.

18:39.291 --> 18:43.089
You have no idea that
is driving him crazy.

18:43.935 --> 18:45.335
Now.

18:48.304 --> 18:50.613
<i>I want you to look at this.</i>

18:51.172 --> 18:56.098
If you want an agreement. I want
you to confess these murders.

19:01.257 --> 19:04.682
I need you to be a good girl.

19:05.098 --> 19:07.589
Keep your mouth shut.

19:08.083 --> 19:10.597
We cannot tell you now.

19:15.193 --> 19:16.745
That is better.

19:19.890 --> 19:21.800
Stay well heated.

19:26.638 --> 19:29.375
That horrible night.
It is not Violet.

19:30.856 --> 19:32.306
Are you all right back there?

19:34.760 --> 19:37.573
This will be a
party so much fun.

19:38.617 --> 19:40.251
It will not be long and slow.

19:41.858 --> 19:44.172
I cannot wait for my guests.

20:02.751 --> 20:04.151
Shit!

20:51.843 --> 20:53.761
Deserter.

20:54.161 --> 20:56.148
Do not be afraid.

20:56.929 --> 20:58.896
You can enjoy the party now.

21:12.593 --> 21:14.493
- Give it a sharp blow.
- Come on!

21:22.969 --> 21:24.369
<i>Slowly.</i>

21:27.281 --> 21:28.681
Bradbury?

21:32.394 --> 21:33.836
The boss wants to see you.

21:35.416 --> 21:36.816
<i>Brave. Bradbury.</i>

21:36.818 --> 21:38.062
Want your greetings.

21:38.064 --> 21:43.009
Bradbury! Seems that the Russian
Stevens has connected to you.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.411
<i>Since we get along
with the high authorities.</i>

21:45.435 --> 21:46.835
<i>Do you want a mission?</i>

21:55.600 --> 21:58.200
15 years. A girl of 10
years called Angel Poel.

21:58.224 --> 22:00.596
She has convicted
of double murder.

22:04.530 --> 22:07.030
It was a huge event that
time. I remember this.

22:07.054 --> 22:10.154
The whole country was horrified
by the ferocity of the attacks.

22:11.107 --> 22:13.941
People did not conform.
A girl of 10 years.

22:13.965 --> 22:16.015
How she mutilated face
of her grandmother.

22:16.039 --> 22:18.324
Cut her best friend apart.

22:19.054 --> 22:23.329
The evil girl was to stay
imprisoned indefinitely.

22:23.331 --> 22:25.296
And never to see
the light of day again.

22:25.725 --> 22:27.554
It is not just that only.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.040
While her in prison.

22:30.042 --> 22:33.135
She befriended a member of
parliament and obnoxious.

22:33.137 --> 22:36.725
What has seen as philanthropic?
Knight in shining armor.

22:37.631 --> 22:40.424
He was a brilliant political
with strong connections.

22:40.426 --> 22:43.067
And made an internal campaign
for her release.

22:44.053 --> 22:46.656
All this in silence. Secret.

22:47.558 --> 22:49.903
Angel Poel died in
prison two years ago.

22:49.905 --> 22:51.843
I remember I read about it.

22:52.057 --> 22:55.389
- So. What?
- She did not die in prison.

22:55.740 --> 22:58.490
We forget her death.
We gave her a new identity.

22:58.514 --> 23:00.214
We let her free in society.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.708
They did this for Bulger,
Myra and Hindley.

23:04.376 --> 23:06.726
Anyway. It worked well
in the first year.

23:06.728 --> 23:08.490
She had the best supervision.

23:08.492 --> 23:11.284
She would ensure
integrated back into society.

23:11.308 --> 23:14.921
<i>But things took a
unexpected way and ugly.</i>

23:15.146 --> 23:17.584
Angel Poel disappeared
without a trace.

23:18.899 --> 23:20.503
Even that!

23:26.554 --> 23:28.936
<i>She was responsible
for these deaths.</i>

23:28.938 --> 23:31.527
<i>Fingerprints confirmed.</i>

23:31.529 --> 23:33.977
<i>I had concern to hide evidence.</i>

23:33.979 --> 23:36.929
<i>How do I explain the media?
That the victims were massacred.</i>

23:36.953 --> 23:38.130
<i>For a convict.</i>

23:38.132 --> 23:40.532
<i>Who died two years ago
in an institution.</i>

23:40.556 --> 23:42.462
My God! Colima.

23:45.886 --> 23:48.936
I was in court when he confessed
these murders.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.813
<i>I do not understand.</i>

23:51.276 --> 23:53.178
Escaped.

23:53.904 --> 23:55.304
Why am I here?

23:55.306 --> 23:57.535
If they find that we
released Angel Poel.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.614
She committed the murders.
Overthrow the government.

24:00.791 --> 24:02.191
How so?

24:02.193 --> 24:04.243
Look. This young and
brilliant political.

24:04.267 --> 24:06.534
That likes so much Angel Poel.

24:08.639 --> 24:11.832
He has so much chance of being
the next prime minister.

24:50.585 --> 24:52.072
How are you? Friend.

24:52.261 --> 24:54.249
I will order the usual. Please.

25:11.447 --> 25:12.847
If I join are you mind?

25:14.019 --> 25:16.175
God! It is cold outside!

25:17.455 --> 25:18.876
I am George.

25:19.759 --> 25:22.409
I have not seen you around
before. I know all in here.

25:22.759 --> 25:24.355
Are you are new around here?

25:28.100 --> 25:29.774
Why are you silent?

25:30.374 --> 25:33.174
What is your name? Honey.
It is all right. I do not bite.

25:43.909 --> 25:45.309
<i>Angel.</i>

26:02.245 --> 26:03.645
What is your name? Honey.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.280
Angel.

26:06.516 --> 26:08.632
Nice name.

26:09.459 --> 26:11.595
What will bring you here?

26:12.602 --> 26:14.286
I am looking for someone.

26:15.395 --> 26:17.950
- A relative.
- Any luck.

26:18.882 --> 26:20.282
I am close.

26:20.284 --> 26:23.634
Would be able to help you if you
want . I know everyone.

26:24.939 --> 26:26.981
This is not a good start.

26:28.779 --> 26:30.329
It is okay. Really.

26:30.527 --> 26:32.121
I think traced something.

26:32.977 --> 26:34.397
It was not easy to get.

26:35.531 --> 26:39.070
I thought of visiting.
Make it a surprise one day.

26:39.610 --> 26:41.010
It would be nice.

26:41.962 --> 26:43.998
Come on!
Tell me more about you.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.950
I bet you are more interesting
than these people over there.

26:51.395 --> 26:52.795
<i>View.</i>

26:52.797 --> 26:55.886
I think I was very civilized
with you. It is all right.

26:56.593 --> 26:59.744
However, honestly I am
beginning to lose my patience.

27:00.004 --> 27:02.492
<i>You prevented me
from doing my job.</i>

27:02.494 --> 27:05.185
<i>This is a crime scene.
I am a cop.</i>

27:05.187 --> 27:06.587
<i>What happens? Mark!</i>

27:06.825 --> 27:10.131
- It seems scene Doctor Who.
- What is it?

27:10.285 --> 27:12.835
This strange! He will not let
me go to the crime scene.

27:12.837 --> 27:14.192
He spoke that is military issue.

27:14.194 --> 27:15.925
Calm down. I look for Bradbury.

27:23.739 --> 27:25.992
<i>Detective Bradbury.
Chief Inspector Lapslie.</i>

27:25.994 --> 27:28.401
These people will not let me go.
You would talk to them.

27:28.403 --> 27:29.367
I want to see the crime scene.

27:29.369 --> 27:31.069
Before you, dear, step on it.

27:32.369 --> 27:33.769
Well!

27:37.734 --> 27:39.791
Let go of the area
around the body.

27:39.943 --> 27:42.745
Signs or no remained
tires traits. All clear.

27:43.493 --> 27:45.453
I have been here for a few days.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.741
I think it is an elderly woman.

27:47.743 --> 27:50.693
However, I am not sure until
collecting samples for testing.

27:50.717 --> 27:52.117
Why?

27:54.312 --> 27:56.705
- Only this?
- I am afraid so. Mr.

27:57.046 --> 27:58.446
Damn!

27:59.400 --> 28:00.800
Where is the rest of it?

28:12.335 --> 28:15.227
I cannot believe people
can do that today.

28:15.229 --> 28:16.629
I do not.

28:16.893 --> 28:19.043
They just told: Get out.
So simply?

28:19.130 --> 28:20.757
They gave me two weeks.

28:20.759 --> 28:23.186
I was not in the testament
of my grandmother.

28:23.188 --> 28:27.546
When she died, they told me that
I have a family as a shelter.

28:27.548 --> 28:28.858
That is it.

28:28.860 --> 28:30.260
What?

28:30.560 --> 28:31.960
Now where do you live?

28:32.256 --> 28:35.280
In none at the moment, but
I will meet somewhere.

28:35.282 --> 28:38.232
- Do you have a job?
- No. However...

28:38.234 --> 28:40.834
I have an aunt who has a pension
near of the cliff.

28:40.858 --> 28:44.047
There is not many people now.
She needs someone to clean up.

28:44.048 --> 28:46.798
- I will talk about you.
- I do not know...

28:46.822 --> 28:48.846
There really is no problem.
I promise.

28:48.848 --> 28:51.698
I am sure it will.
Let us make a deal.

28:51.722 --> 28:54.417
Frankly, she would have
company. She is good.

28:54.419 --> 28:55.819
You will like it.

28:58.315 --> 29:00.915
I got a call in the middle
of the night Top Barasti.

29:00.980 --> 29:02.530
Speaking to work with the army.

29:02.554 --> 29:05.225
Equal to my assistant.
Which is quite witty?

29:05.227 --> 29:06.614
Cooperate fully.

29:06.616 --> 29:09.176
And under no circumstances
do not ask questions.

29:10.391 --> 29:14.429
- And?
- What is going on?

29:15.081 --> 29:16.481
Detective...

29:16.489 --> 29:19.239
Do not give me that: "It is
a fucking military issue."

29:19.263 --> 29:23.603
You want my cooperation.
Tell me. What is going on?

29:24.457 --> 29:27.402
I would say about its position.

29:27.797 --> 29:30.334
If you need information.
You will have it.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.086
But if you keep talking to me
like a piece of shit.

29:33.110 --> 29:36.310
I will retire your "balls". You
will have them in your throat.

29:39.167 --> 29:40.811
Do you want another drink?

29:43.682 --> 29:45.633
- Of course!
- It is all right.

29:52.098 --> 29:54.678
You sound like a good girl.
Angel.

29:54.680 --> 29:57.780
I will hire you for a month.
To see how you will do.

29:58.711 --> 30:00.643
<i>I cannot pay you so much.</i>

30:00.645 --> 30:01.654
<i>But you will eat here.</i>

30:01.656 --> 30:04.156
<i>You have a room until
make ends meet.</i>

30:04.276 --> 30:05.676
Thank you.

30:05.692 --> 30:09.214
<i>George show where
is the master suite for Angel.</i>

30:09.216 --> 30:10.240
Yes. Aunt.

30:10.445 --> 30:13.977
<i>You must be tired.
Then you will begin tomorrow.</i>

30:15.491 --> 30:17.591
<i>Where is the rest of
your luggage? Angel.</i>

30:18.983 --> 30:20.433
It is just this.

30:20.435 --> 30:22.980
You cannot even put
your shoes in there.

30:24.869 --> 30:26.669
Where is the rest of your stuff?

30:27.482 --> 30:28.882
Stolen.

30:28.898 --> 30:30.298
Stolen.

30:31.261 --> 30:32.661
<i>Where.</i>

30:33.371 --> 30:34.771
I am not sure.

30:36.549 --> 30:37.949
Are you not sure?

30:38.099 --> 30:39.855
Well! It was on the train.

30:39.857 --> 30:43.990
I fell asleep and wake up my
luggage was gone. Disappeared.

30:43.992 --> 30:46.169
Do you report to the police?
Honey.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.078
Not!

30:48.080 --> 30:49.799
Why did you not report?

30:49.801 --> 30:51.892
Because I thought it
was not worth it.

30:51.894 --> 30:54.803
I mean. They never do anything.
Anyway.

30:59.492 --> 31:01.869
I will give an advance to
you tomorrow morning.

31:01.971 --> 31:04.246
You can buy things
some clothes.

31:04.270 --> 31:06.670
<i>There are many shops of clothes
on the boardwalk.</i>

31:07.864 --> 31:10.414
I will make a report to the
police tomorrow morning.

31:10.438 --> 31:12.056
Why not!

31:15.824 --> 31:17.224
So...

31:17.514 --> 31:18.914
What do you think?

31:22.236 --> 31:26.228
If you need anything.
Just tell me.

31:26.230 --> 31:27.930
My room is upstairs.

31:29.474 --> 31:32.528
I propose something. Why you
not go where I work tomorrow.

31:32.530 --> 31:35.939
I work on the pier. You can
eat a snack and a drink.

31:35.941 --> 31:37.341
If you want.

31:37.810 --> 31:39.481
Yes. This would be good.

31:44.534 --> 31:46.079
I have not left her alone.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.100
<i>Angel.</i>

32:21.259 --> 32:23.613
- Screw it.
- I know.

32:24.272 --> 32:26.866
Are amazing things? But.

32:27.065 --> 32:28.902
I do not see fear.

32:28.904 --> 32:30.654
These things happen
all the time.

32:30.678 --> 32:33.451
People do shit and we have
to clean up the their mess.

32:34.224 --> 32:36.974
<i>We need to find Angel
and bring it back to us.</i>

32:37.244 --> 32:38.940
It will not be easy.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.592
The cover-up started it.

32:40.594 --> 32:43.760
Therefore, you find doors closed
dead ends.

32:45.535 --> 32:47.270
Supposedly, we should do things.

32:48.155 --> 32:49.839
How to keep it a secret?

32:49.841 --> 32:52.541
I signed a cloistered secrecy,
It depends where she is.

32:52.565 --> 32:55.242
Takes her to a secret
military wing. I guess.

32:55.423 --> 32:58.695
<i>No one ever sees
or hear about her again.</i>

33:03.363 --> 33:04.883
Breakfast. Honey.

33:04.885 --> 33:06.854
I am not hungry. Thanks.

33:07.798 --> 33:10.266
What for you are looking?
I can help you find.

33:10.268 --> 33:12.979
It is all right. I found it.

33:12.981 --> 33:17.650
- Transport Police.
- It is just an old bag. Leave.

33:17.992 --> 33:22.340
- Hello? I want to report a theft.
- I told you to leave.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.569
I need take a shower.

33:42.256 --> 33:43.756
Be my special guest.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.656
I am dying.

33:57.691 --> 33:59.091
Come on!

34:00.552 --> 34:02.055
I think I will take my car.

34:03.519 --> 34:04.919
Yes. Where you are.

34:04.921 --> 34:08.109
Take it easy. I am
feel bad today.

34:08.110 --> 34:09.510
Okay.

34:12.739 --> 34:14.998
Where do we go?
View the chief minister.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.621
Maybe.

34:18.628 --> 34:21.547
- Do you mind if I put a song.
- Yes. I do.

34:22.956 --> 34:24.357
Okay.

34:25.956 --> 34:29.502
What are you doing? We return.
Will you stop this crap?

34:29.504 --> 34:32.271
Jesus! For God's sake!

34:33.472 --> 34:36.016
Okay. Look at that car!

34:54.949 --> 34:56.393
<i>Answer the phone.</i>

34:57.109 --> 34:58.509
Bradbury.

34:58.892 --> 35:01.164
<i>Sorry to bother you.
Is my boss there?</i>

35:03.223 --> 35:04.623
Yes. What happen? Mark.

35:04.625 --> 35:05.901
<i>They called you again.</i>

35:05.903 --> 35:07.953
<i>I tried to contact you
all morning.</i>

35:08.110 --> 35:10.910
<i>The Bradbury kitchen is good.
It is not. Beautiful marble</i>

35:10.934 --> 35:13.306
Mark. We just... We...

35:14.497 --> 35:15.897
Hands free.

35:16.216 --> 35:18.202
- Contact.
<i>- We got a clue.</i>

35:18.204 --> 35:22.424
<i>It reported an elderly vanished.
They found blood in the house.</i>

35:22.919 --> 35:24.319
Yes. Where is it?

35:26.018 --> 35:28.368
<i>I want to transfer
to a better prison.</i>

35:29.354 --> 35:30.754
What?

35:31.248 --> 35:34.327
- You called me to ask this.
- No.

35:35.739 --> 35:38.422
I talked to some
friends in here.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.192
They told you have harmed to me.

35:42.381 --> 35:45.152
There are many people
very smart in here.

35:45.154 --> 35:47.300
They said...

35:47.994 --> 35:50.704
If I go to the press.

35:50.706 --> 35:53.766
I earn a lot of money if
I tell them my story.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.238
<i>Did you hear what I said boss?</i>

35:58.963 --> 36:03.314
If you think that can blackmail me.
It is another thing you will have.

36:03.806 --> 36:06.190
I not blackmail you. Boss.

36:06.944 --> 36:08.833
It is a fact.

36:10.734 --> 36:12.842
Is a category in prison? Man.

36:13.549 --> 36:16.142
<i>We are locked 23 hours a day.</i>

36:16.535 --> 36:18.635
<i>The lights are on all night.</i>

36:19.788 --> 36:21.388
All I want to be transfer.

36:22.202 --> 36:23.602
Is it easy? Right?

36:24.964 --> 36:27.275
It is no big deal.

36:30.901 --> 36:32.470
I will think about it.

36:36.982 --> 36:38.887
Okay. Big boss.

36:38.889 --> 36:40.868
You will think about it.

36:58.203 --> 36:59.603
Okay.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.890
I think. I understand
acts as a bitch.

37:02.680 --> 37:05.230
<i>Right. We can find out
exactly what happened.</i>

37:05.429 --> 37:08.279
We will not be Sherlock Holmes
to realize how it works.

37:08.303 --> 37:11.603
She hit a old woman with a vase.
She dragged her to the bathroom.

37:11.627 --> 37:12.808
Why bring her to the bathroom?

37:12.810 --> 37:15.387
- It makes no sense.
<i>- It makes sense to her.</i>

37:15.638 --> 37:17.488
Do you saw the profile
of a prisoner?

37:17.617 --> 37:20.917
Among other things. A grandmother
placed she in the tub with ice.

37:20.919 --> 37:22.221
<i>In the dark, as punishment.</i>

37:22.223 --> 37:23.623
For hours.

37:23.981 --> 37:26.081
A 10 year old. Can you
imagine it?

37:26.082 --> 37:27.782
Classically people
who has abused.

37:27.806 --> 37:29.806
Tend to believe that
are guilty for this.

37:29.808 --> 37:32.558
I think Angel tries find a
surrogate to her grandmother.

37:32.582 --> 37:35.148
Even the priest said the girl
seemed very happy.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.504
Therefore, I think
you are wrong.

37:37.528 --> 37:39.084
It is not that simple.

37:39.252 --> 37:42.948
How many abuse victims?
Has an irrational belief.

37:42.950 --> 37:47.624
<i>There abusers who have seen
everything. They were omniscient.</i>

37:47.981 --> 37:49.781
I do not understand
the second word.

37:49.805 --> 37:51.295
Omniscient. This is how God.

37:51.297 --> 37:53.747
<i>You can read thoughts.
You can view the movements.</i>

37:53.771 --> 37:56.937
It is possible because of this.
Without anyone, say anything.

37:57.281 --> 37:59.331
It was after placed
her in the corner.

37:59.355 --> 38:01.771
She can do what we call:
"Ignore the rule."

38:01.773 --> 38:05.522
Investigate the profile of
grandmother, not naughty Angel.

38:06.175 --> 38:07.575
How are she prompted?

38:07.577 --> 38:11.322
<i>Can be a click, a look, a word
that influenced.</i>

38:11.324 --> 38:12.491
She will not stop.

38:12.493 --> 38:14.382
What will make she
more dangerous?

38:14.384 --> 38:17.808
We deal with two different
very dangerous personalities.

38:19.055 --> 38:21.653
- Two killers.
- It is a way of saying.

38:21.813 --> 38:24.918
Angel. Grandmother, and...

38:26.505 --> 38:28.180
I do not know whom else.

38:58.590 --> 39:00.277
You look wonderful.

39:01.832 --> 39:03.987
Thank you. George.

39:05.296 --> 39:06.894
Wait two minutes. Yes.

39:18.999 --> 39:20.399
Wait.

39:39.453 --> 39:41.661
<i>Did you it again?</i>

39:41.663 --> 39:44.116
You kill the bitch aunt.

39:44.118 --> 39:47.291
<i>You became a whore,
equal to your sister.</i>

39:47.293 --> 39:49.970
They will come to you.
Say this now.

39:49.999 --> 39:51.970
Will you capture it?

39:52.535 --> 39:56.225
You know what happens with
people who accuse us?

39:57.148 --> 40:00.172
We cut their skin
in bloody pieces!

40:05.148 --> 40:06.548
Angel?

40:07.199 --> 40:08.599
Angel?

40:11.199 --> 40:16.199
PIER WALDRON

40:18.029 --> 40:19.429
What is wrong?

40:19.431 --> 40:21.618
Sorry. I am sorry. George.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.542
Do you apologize for what?

40:23.544 --> 40:25.565
I just got scared. It is all.

40:25.567 --> 40:27.167
You have nothing to worry.

40:27.191 --> 40:29.841
Many people find something
that leaves them fearful.

40:30.184 --> 40:32.834
They let us see them
night with the lights on.

40:32.858 --> 40:35.358
It will be like being in
an old horror movie.

40:37.251 --> 40:38.651
Yes. You will see.

40:38.662 --> 40:40.339
Come on!

40:44.462 --> 40:48.103
I cannot believe
you chose onion pickles.

40:48.105 --> 40:49.805
You will regret for
choosing this.

40:52.041 --> 40:54.750
I told you the best
"Chips" in the world.

40:56.440 --> 40:59.524
- Want a drink.
- Yes. Please.

41:02.848 --> 41:05.450
I just stole.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.190
So. I kept it.

41:07.583 --> 41:10.360
I think it will take a year and
I will move to London.

41:10.370 --> 41:12.637
Here is nice but very boring.

41:13.338 --> 41:14.778
It was always.

41:15.465 --> 41:18.949
- You have been here before.
- Yes. Years ago.

41:19.620 --> 41:21.443
In another life. Time.

41:23.605 --> 41:25.644
You can come with
me if you want.

41:26.998 --> 41:28.398
Where?

41:28.495 --> 41:29.973
To London!

41:31.226 --> 41:32.626
I like it!

41:33.325 --> 41:34.911
Do you really want to go?

41:42.140 --> 41:43.912
I think I like being here.

41:44.328 --> 41:46.162
Yes. You know.

41:46.172 --> 41:49.522
The next time we come. We will
drink and I put under the table.

41:49.546 --> 41:51.109
You purchase then...

41:51.441 --> 41:53.477
Hoping I can get drunk.

41:53.487 --> 41:55.637
You have your way with me.

41:56.659 --> 41:59.009
I get it.
Not even crossed my mind!

42:01.197 --> 42:02.597
Are you happy?

42:03.902 --> 42:06.376
I have never been so happy.
George.

42:09.714 --> 42:11.610
It is late. We must return.

42:12.337 --> 42:14.425
Do not yet.

42:16.336 --> 42:18.047
Do not want to go back?

42:19.215 --> 42:22.267
I want to stay here. With you.

42:22.652 --> 42:24.231
I am flattered.

42:25.358 --> 42:29.021
Do you want another drink?
What do you want?

42:30.619 --> 42:32.180
I want to have sex.

42:32.490 --> 42:35.088
- What?
- I want to have sex.

42:36.389 --> 42:37.789
You and me.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.793
I want to make love with you.

43:50.639 --> 43:54.086
Why let an arm
severed without the body.

43:54.096 --> 43:57.233
I mean upload
body is very difficult.

43:58.206 --> 44:01.335
Why will take it for a
distant and old house?

44:02.330 --> 44:05.891
She trying to create a scenario
in which felt to be in control.

44:05.901 --> 44:07.548
Happens in many cases.

44:07.558 --> 44:11.971
Kellows. Lek. Bundy. Dennis.
They not kept the body for sex.

44:11.981 --> 44:13.931
They held it only for company.

44:14.541 --> 44:16.941
There is a reason that leads
to keep the victims.

44:18.223 --> 44:19.623
Like what?

44:22.127 --> 44:25.027
All murderers in series leave
something at the scene crime.

44:25.051 --> 44:27.008
It is like a cry for help.

44:27.018 --> 44:29.868
As if, it wanted to be
captured and needed that.

44:29.892 --> 44:30.940
Who knows?

44:31.160 --> 44:32.560
Find the...

44:33.340 --> 44:34.740
Screw it!

44:34.750 --> 44:37.416
I wish to be with someone else.

44:38.809 --> 44:40.222
<i>Are you all right?</i>

44:42.204 --> 44:43.823
<i>This was very calm.</i>

44:45.458 --> 44:47.377
<i>You were very kind to me.</i>

44:48.324 --> 44:49.923
<i>Very affectionate.</i>

44:51.974 --> 44:54.617
I could stay with you
the rest of my life.

44:57.049 --> 44:59.268
You would love London.

44:59.278 --> 45:01.264
Despite what they say.

45:02.539 --> 45:05.243
We could go now.

45:05.892 --> 45:08.398
You do not play with something.

45:09.211 --> 45:11.034
I am not. George.

45:11.909 --> 45:15.761
We would catch the train now.
Just you and me.

45:16.776 --> 45:20.661
No one ever would know
Would not care.

45:20.671 --> 45:23.098
We had a great time.
It was amazing.

45:23.108 --> 45:25.649
It was just one night.
Why are you in a hurry?

45:28.550 --> 45:31.200
See what time it is!
I am already late for work.

45:39.367 --> 45:41.001
<i>How the way is it?</i>

45:41.766 --> 45:44.356
- With what?
<i>- With Aunt.</i>

45:45.100 --> 45:46.592
Okay.

45:47.310 --> 45:49.310
She would not mind if I left.

45:49.503 --> 45:51.063
She would be happy.

45:52.362 --> 45:54.948
Believe me.
I would not be happy.

45:57.041 --> 45:58.937
<i>Your bitch.</i>

45:59.642 --> 46:01.849
<i>You are now finished! Bitch.</i>

46:02.394 --> 46:04.210
<i>Just do before falling.</i>

46:04.574 --> 46:05.974
No!

46:06.351 --> 46:07.927
No! Go away!

46:09.031 --> 46:10.892
What happened? Honey.

46:11.378 --> 46:12.778
<i>Are you okay Angel?</i>

46:13.272 --> 46:14.672
Yes.

46:15.550 --> 46:17.441
I just was talking to myself.

46:22.288 --> 46:24.014
You go to work.

46:24.024 --> 46:26.382
I need help aunt cleaning.

46:26.840 --> 46:29.183
Okay. I finish at six.

46:29.193 --> 46:32.572
- I will be back here. Yes.
- Do not run after work.

46:34.522 --> 46:36.216
I love you. George.

46:37.637 --> 46:39.757
I will never allow
someone hurt you.

46:40.835 --> 46:42.322
Anyone.

47:07.758 --> 47:10.007
Shit! Damn!

47:10.601 --> 47:12.451
- I did not mean to scare you.
- Shit!

47:12.461 --> 47:14.831
- I am sorry.
- I told you.

47:14.841 --> 47:17.320
Do what you have to do.
I do not want to know.

47:17.330 --> 47:20.726
Do not bury your head in the
sand pretend it never happened.

47:20.736 --> 47:23.589
- You agreed to this.
- This is in the other hands.

47:23.599 --> 47:25.599
This imminent thing they do.

47:26.473 --> 47:29.323
- And what do you want from me?
- I need your approval.

47:29.347 --> 47:31.402
Okay. Do you want my consent?

47:31.842 --> 47:34.057
Do not try to dissect
me like I am...

47:34.067 --> 47:37.775
A small beetle sick.
You are piece of shit!

47:37.785 --> 47:41.674
People are in line to leave.

47:42.453 --> 47:44.438
If we need to take
drastic measures.

47:44.448 --> 47:47.148
I want to make sure that
you know the consequences.

47:47.202 --> 47:48.602
I am sorry. Jim.

47:48.612 --> 47:51.461
I feel the same
the fucking Dyke!

47:51.471 --> 47:53.821
Every time there is a
plague, someone appears.

47:53.845 --> 47:55.344
Cause and effect.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.608
Well is how the world.

47:58.704 --> 48:02.796
- You want me to proceed.
- What the hell?

48:03.552 --> 48:05.618
Anyway, we are close.

48:09.288 --> 48:10.762
Indeed!

48:20.840 --> 48:23.021
<i>Forget what it is.</i>

48:23.462 --> 48:26.889
<i>All right. Man.</i>

48:39.793 --> 48:41.555
- Hello!
- Hello!

49:08.732 --> 49:11.546
Chief do you has a cigarette?

49:43.973 --> 49:46.984
- Get down!
- Away! Out!

49:46.994 --> 49:49.192
What is wrong? What is going on?

49:50.348 --> 49:51.829
I know him.

49:52.188 --> 49:54.277
I know you. Man!

50:16.842 --> 50:18.299
Let us make a toast.

50:19.107 --> 50:21.654
- To faith!
- To faith!

50:28.262 --> 50:31.188
- Do you believe in love?
- Absolutely! 100%!

50:31.198 --> 50:32.598
- Really?
- Yes.

50:32.961 --> 50:34.361
Why?

50:34.371 --> 50:36.701
I see many people who do not.

50:37.564 --> 50:38.964
Like what?

50:40.201 --> 50:43.143
I believe in fate.

50:43.153 --> 50:47.635
I think of how many variables
it takes to be dead.

50:47.645 --> 50:50.368
- Right?
- I was just trying to talk.

50:50.378 --> 50:53.056
- I am sorry.
- I think about it.

50:53.066 --> 50:55.665
Infinite circumstances
sequence of events.

50:55.675 --> 50:59.088
What does the serial killer?
To chose the victim.

50:59.098 --> 51:01.713
The right person in
the wrong place.

51:02.381 --> 51:03.781
- What?
- Hello!

51:03.791 --> 51:04.991
I am a police officer!

51:05.001 --> 51:08.357
- Return for it!
- Get off!

51:12.274 --> 51:13.674
Come on!

51:14.562 --> 51:15.962
Thank you.

51:23.725 --> 51:26.275
I lived here all my life,
did not learn to swim.

51:26.299 --> 51:28.492
What madness! It is not normal.

51:28.502 --> 51:30.029
Of course it is.

51:30.039 --> 51:34.123
It is like living in London and
never go to Buckingham Palace.

51:34.433 --> 51:36.421
Yes. When you put this way.

51:38.850 --> 51:40.250
George.

51:41.718 --> 51:43.773
I will be leaving soon.

51:45.850 --> 51:47.827
I want you to come with me.

51:48.605 --> 51:50.383
We can go to London.

51:50.393 --> 51:53.173
Can we go Timbuktu?
If you want, but...

51:54.176 --> 51:56.037
I want us to be together.

51:56.894 --> 51:58.369
It is not that easy.

51:58.953 --> 52:00.353
Why?

52:00.363 --> 52:01.870
Why...

52:03.224 --> 52:04.759
Why should we go now?

52:04.769 --> 52:06.819
Why not wait by the
end of summer?

52:06.843 --> 52:09.203
We know it is better
to us have some time.

52:10.262 --> 52:11.808
The time is up.

52:12.865 --> 52:14.424
What do you mean?

52:14.434 --> 52:15.834
<i>Hello. Angel.</i>

52:18.025 --> 52:20.221
<i>Hello. Angel.</i>

52:22.009 --> 52:24.059
What do you mean with:
"Time is up"?

52:24.524 --> 52:25.924
Nothing.

52:26.379 --> 52:27.779
Nothing!

52:36.825 --> 52:38.620
What are you doing George?

52:39.134 --> 52:41.750
- I called her aunt to talk.
- What you tell to her.

52:41.760 --> 52:44.987
- That we be late.
- You ruined it now!

52:44.997 --> 52:48.421
You ruined everything! Bastard!

53:22.581 --> 53:24.029
Answer the phone!

53:24.701 --> 53:27.135
- Bradbury.
<i>- We got a clue.</i>

53:27.145 --> 53:30.106
<i>One body have dragged
to the shore near the pier.</i>

53:30.116 --> 53:31.370
<i>You guess what.</i>

53:31.380 --> 53:35.184
<i>When you go at home. We found the
dismembered body of an woman old.</i>

53:37.040 --> 53:38.531
It is a lucky man.

53:39.116 --> 53:42.578
I do not know if he is even luck.
Your aunt did not recognize him.

53:44.411 --> 53:45.811
What do you think?

53:46.173 --> 53:48.173
I think this is a big mess.

53:48.197 --> 53:50.632
These are the final stages of
an emotional mess.

53:50.642 --> 53:53.925
Check out the video surveillance
camera and take pictures.

53:53.935 --> 53:56.185
We need to know how
she looks like now.

53:56.195 --> 53:59.217
Search on database
through the interceptions.

53:59.427 --> 54:00.827
Done. Boss.

54:02.853 --> 54:05.276
Who has intercepted?

54:07.673 --> 54:10.492
Calm child! Otherwise bursts!

54:10.841 --> 54:12.341
One for you, young man.

54:12.616 --> 54:14.016
Thank you.

54:24.910 --> 54:28.077
You know what happened
with Path. Angel?

54:28.883 --> 54:30.746
What he said...

54:30.756 --> 54:33.808
We cut them in damn pieces!

55:07.992 --> 55:09.479
Who is it?

55:12.996 --> 55:14.479
Who is it?

55:35.778 --> 55:37.482
Are you Tommy Paul?

55:39.569 --> 55:41.083
<i>Who are ask?</i>

55:41.993 --> 55:43.892
I am a friend of his niece.

55:44.254 --> 55:45.809
Angel.

55:49.326 --> 55:51.340
Then enter.

56:00.496 --> 56:01.976
So?

56:03.244 --> 56:05.580
Sit down here.

56:09.908 --> 56:12.012
Whatever with me?

56:31.467 --> 56:33.075
Where did you get this?

56:45.224 --> 56:46.676
This happened...

56:50.571 --> 56:52.826
Long time ago.

56:55.659 --> 56:59.921
I tell you.
I am more a man of this...

56:59.931 --> 57:01.564
Photos.

57:03.212 --> 57:05.865
There is a big difference now.

57:06.890 --> 57:10.177
Do you attempt to blackmail me?

57:11.183 --> 57:13.682
Do you want to destroy my life?

57:14.927 --> 57:17.255
You cannot. Girl!

57:19.496 --> 57:22.304
I have very important friends.

57:26.039 --> 57:28.150
Do you want some money?

57:28.160 --> 57:32.336
I have some savings to
buy the photos.

57:35.568 --> 57:37.708
I will give you all the photos.

57:38.850 --> 57:41.024
I will give all the
rolls of film.

57:42.640 --> 57:44.983
However, I want to do something.

57:46.367 --> 57:49.937
In memory of Angel.

57:50.769 --> 57:52.169
What?

57:54.737 --> 57:56.777
What does this mean?

57:57.998 --> 58:00.136
I have some friends.

58:01.327 --> 58:04.843
Some young friends.

58:05.810 --> 58:07.391
I want you to...

58:09.479 --> 58:11.372
Come to a party.

58:16.465 --> 58:19.078
I found in some old records.

58:19.288 --> 58:21.388
The image of the suspicion
in hospital of the prison.

58:21.398 --> 58:23.798
Therefore, I have included
some photos randomly.

58:23.799 --> 58:26.695
Some clues provided
by witnesses.

58:26.705 --> 58:28.901
Turned it into digital data.

58:28.911 --> 58:30.661
And the insert this
in the program.

58:30.671 --> 58:33.909
What we analyzed the information
Turned them into meta-data.

58:33.919 --> 58:37.045
The program found online
on the system surveillance.

58:37.055 --> 58:39.755
In areas where
related crimes occurred.

58:39.765 --> 58:41.542
Look what I found.

58:41.552 --> 58:45.315
She used credit cards of
victims to buy clothes.

58:45.325 --> 58:47.675
She withdrew money
from several ATM's.

58:47.684 --> 58:51.485
All cameras has hidden, so...

58:52.080 --> 58:53.512
I found!

58:54.108 --> 58:57.765
Ladies and gentlemen.
Angel. How she looks like now.

58:57.775 --> 58:59.433
Are you sure?

58:59.701 --> 59:03.301
- May have changed identity.
- It has taken a few hours ago.

59:03.325 --> 59:05.910
Well now has 94 min. Indeed.

59:06.361 --> 59:08.729
This is your last
known location.

59:13.386 --> 59:15.899
What for people return here.

59:16.864 --> 59:18.552
Is a ballroom.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.526
Do you remember?

59:21.821 --> 59:23.309
Come on!

59:32.342 --> 59:33.769
Come!

59:45.341 --> 59:46.742
After you.

59:53.542 --> 59:57.071
- Where do we go? Honey.
- At the ballroom.

59:57.784 --> 59:59.243
You know the way.

01:00:05.332 --> 01:00:06.732
Come on.

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:19.245
Here is Angel.
Do not be afraid. Honey.

01:00:19.255 --> 01:00:23.125
Uncle Tommy does not want
to do any harm to you.

01:00:55.322 --> 01:01:00.091
<i>If you do not look at the screen.
I will take more fingers of you.</i>

01:01:01.452 --> 01:01:03.008
<i>Look at the screen.</i>

01:01:03.874 --> 01:01:07.842
Look at the screen!

01:01:10.272 --> 01:01:12.780
What did you do with the
body in the garden?

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:15.032
The police did not find it.

01:01:15.909 --> 01:01:17.983
<i>Where is the sister of Angel?</i>

01:01:17.993 --> 01:01:22.023
Angel after the death of his
mother. Your sister ran away.

01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:26.671
We told you that
she had buried in there.

01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:29.645
Iris had the idea.

01:01:30.611 --> 01:01:32.123
She told us...

01:01:33.803 --> 01:01:38.803
She told us that you
entertain at parties.

01:01:40.354 --> 01:01:42.343
By God!

01:01:43.086 --> 01:01:45.360
It was Iris.

01:01:49.356 --> 01:01:51.120
Is it so?

01:01:54.632 --> 01:01:57.271
Tom did you tell all to
your grandmother?

01:01:58.607 --> 01:02:01.159
<i>Do you see who
is talking now? Tom.</i>

01:02:03.157 --> 01:02:06.631
<i>Do you know what happens
to people in hell?</i>

01:02:08.045 --> 01:02:13.045
You are the first. Then
I will meet the bitch Angel.

01:02:14.656 --> 01:02:19.656
Then it will be a great
damn happy family!

01:02:27.517 --> 01:02:29.768
Excuse me sir.
Have you seen this woman?

01:02:30.489 --> 01:02:33.690
- No. I have not seen.
- Stay with the photo.

01:02:37.716 --> 01:02:39.116
Excuse me sir.

01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:40.998
Have you seen this woman?

01:02:44.215 --> 01:02:46.981
Try with Tommy.
At the park, my friend.

01:02:46.991 --> 01:02:48.177
- Over there?
- Yes. Over there.

01:02:48.187 --> 01:02:49.544
- Keep the photo. Right?
- Yes.

01:02:49.554 --> 01:02:51.404
- Giving to others.
- It is all right.

01:02:54.128 --> 01:02:55.586
Hello?

01:03:46.854 --> 01:03:48.382
<i>There it is.</i>

01:03:49.501 --> 01:03:50.901
<i>There it is.</i>

01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:54.073
<i>Bring the bitch Angel
to enjoy the party.</i>

01:04:01.136 --> 01:04:03.987
I checked the checks.
You better read this.

01:04:03.997 --> 01:04:05.080
Okay.

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:09.888
<i>I began to search for kidnapping
in the park of a girl 10 years.</i>

01:04:09.898 --> 01:04:11.762
This is not a coincidence.

01:04:12.335 --> 01:04:13.830
Definitely is she.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.373
- She took the girl.
- She did very well.

01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:19.222
Have fingerprints
confirmed in the pictures?

01:04:19.232 --> 01:04:21.472
- From Angel.
- Nobody can hide anything.

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:24.782
- Neither the "Majesty" government.
- Absolutely. What you did.

01:04:24.792 --> 01:04:27.792
I insert the pictures of the
house in comparison program.

01:04:29.226 --> 01:04:32.080
<i>- "House of Horrors"</i>
- What?

01:04:32.226 --> 01:04:34.080
KUCA UZASA

01:04:34.558 --> 01:04:38.494
This is in Croatian and means:
"House of Horrors".

01:04:39.034 --> 01:04:41.130
The story of house
has a location.

01:04:42.002 --> 01:04:44.452
- I will meet the address.
- Yes. Let us to go!

01:04:44.476 --> 01:04:45.876
Just give me a minute!

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:48.239
I spotted!

01:04:48.263 --> 01:04:50.624
Send in the car! Good job!

01:04:52.797 --> 01:04:54.267
Read this.

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:00.963
We need to talk.

01:05:01.654 --> 01:05:03.109
You should be honest with me.

01:05:03.119 --> 01:05:05.854
Mark found some photos
in her uncle's house.

01:05:05.864 --> 01:05:08.614
In some photos.
Has no mask. There is a face.

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.154
Why did not you tell me?

01:05:10.178 --> 01:05:12.884
Because we were,
busy and scared.

01:05:12.894 --> 01:05:15.318
Afraid of what?

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.729
This is the question.
We do not know.

01:05:18.785 --> 01:05:21.935
Mark did not recognize the face.
Therefore, I did some research.

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:25.540
Died in mysterious circumstances
years ago.

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:29.049
<i>Is a relative of a
prominent chief of staff.</i>

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:31.926
<i>- He is brother of David Blunt.
- What?</i>

01:05:31.936 --> 01:05:34.777
This is very serious.
What is going on?

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:39.279
I did not know.
They never told me.

01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:41.693
Who? Who ever told you?

01:05:43.794 --> 01:05:45.299
I do not want it. A bad thing.

01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:48.737
- I don't want to find out pedophiles!
- I neither!

01:05:48.747 --> 01:05:52.250
- We are in this together!
- Are you?

01:05:53.019 --> 01:05:57.104
- We are on the same side!
- You have never been on the same side!

01:05:57.114 --> 01:06:01.403
I bring criminal to justice!
You find them and kill!

01:06:01.413 --> 01:06:05.321
- Look! Now!
- You not cheat on me now!

01:06:06.814 --> 01:06:10.004
Look into my eyes and tell me
the truth. When we find Angel.

01:06:12.192 --> 01:06:14.119
What will happen to Mark and me?

01:06:15.515 --> 01:06:18.515
We had found dead under
mysterious circumstances.

01:06:18.539 --> 01:06:21.491
In some forest, as David Kelly.

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:27.730
See! I do not know exactly
what happens, but trust me.

01:06:29.445 --> 01:06:33.350
I will do as the highest
priority protect both.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.931
Now there is a little girl
who needs our help.

01:06:51.542 --> 01:06:53.658
You must be kidding me!

01:06:58.672 --> 01:07:01.272
Okay. I will go by the party
behind for recognition.

01:07:01.282 --> 01:07:02.846
You will not leave without me.

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:07.210
This is what I do.
You do not worry.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.291
If I need you. I will call.

01:09:08.962 --> 01:09:10.435
My God!

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:12.996
Anita. It is all right.
Do not worry.

01:09:21.644 --> 01:09:25.144
I would you leave it in mouth
until we get out of this house.

01:09:29.642 --> 01:09:31.189
Bradbury?

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:37.828
Bradbury?

01:09:44.904 --> 01:09:46.305
Bradbury?

01:09:56.678 --> 01:09:58.078
Bradbury?

01:10:17.789 --> 01:10:19.189
Anita?

01:10:19.199 --> 01:10:21.050
It is okay. I am a cop.

01:10:30.007 --> 01:10:32.263
Angel is a bad girl.

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:36.898
- Time to hunt in the garden.
<i>- Anita.</i>

01:10:38.054 --> 01:10:40.401
Stay away from her. Bitch!

01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:23.869
Where they will take him?

01:11:24.558 --> 01:11:25.958
Relocation.

01:11:25.968 --> 01:11:29.695
We should not waste time
with these people.

01:11:32.169 --> 01:11:33.666
Good job. Bradbury!

01:11:36.095 --> 01:11:37.615
Come on!

01:11:45.784 --> 01:11:49.338
<i>Anita Penny still missing
after 9 days.</i>

01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:52.659
<i>The police have no clues
about where she is.</i>

01:12:00.464 --> 01:12:01.864
Yes.

01:12:01.874 --> 01:12:03.304
<i>It is been over a week.</i>

01:12:03.314 --> 01:12:04.714
What is going on?

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.554
<i>Tell me.</i>

01:12:06.744 --> 01:12:08.463
This is very strange.

01:12:08.473 --> 01:12:11.866
<i>- I have no idea about anything.</i>
- The police.

01:12:12.176 --> 01:12:15.846
Not a word. I am scared.

01:12:15.856 --> 01:12:19.677
I am paranoid. I do not think
that I will remain silent.

01:12:19.687 --> 01:12:22.281
- Should I say something to someone?
- Mark!

01:12:22.958 --> 01:12:25.270
I need that you get
out of your home.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.588
<i>Listen to me. This
is very important.</i>

01:12:27.598 --> 01:12:29.522
<i>Do not tell anyone.</i>

01:12:29.532 --> 01:12:32.593
<i>Get out of your house until
solving the situation. Okay.</i>

01:12:32.603 --> 01:12:34.003
Okay.

01:12:37.139 --> 01:12:38.539
Mark?

01:12:38.807 --> 01:12:40.207
Get in!

01:12:43.579 --> 01:12:45.193
Bradbury wants to see you.

01:12:46.088 --> 01:12:47.713
I am happy to see her.

01:13:06.471 --> 01:13:07.871
Jesus!

01:13:08.345 --> 01:13:09.745
How did you get here?

01:13:10.064 --> 01:13:11.464
You lied to me!

01:13:12.064 --> 01:13:13.464
<i>Where is the girl?</i>

01:13:13.469 --> 01:13:16.300
Save in your house now.

01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:19.556
Pick up the phone and prove. Or
you fly through the damn window!

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:29.098
- Where is she now?
- Over there!

01:13:35.215 --> 01:13:36.615
Where?

01:13:36.625 --> 01:13:38.025
Next the trees.

01:13:38.761 --> 01:13:40.824
Go on. Mark! It is all right!

01:13:41.071 --> 01:13:42.471
Go on!

01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:48.651
What happened?

01:13:48.871 --> 01:13:51.352
I am telling you
all will be all right.

01:13:52.464 --> 01:13:53.864
I will go with you.

01:13:54.136 --> 01:13:55.536
Go!

01:13:59.483 --> 01:14:00.883
Bradbury?

01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:03.717
Are you there?

01:14:09.456 --> 01:14:10.856
You will do.

01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:16.732
I am sorry. Mark.

01:14:19.065 --> 01:14:20.465
Please.

01:14:21.873 --> 01:14:23.567
Please. We are friends!

01:14:25.146 --> 01:14:27.235
You should not do this!

01:14:29.706 --> 01:14:31.490
I did not do anything wrong.

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:36.490
Please.

01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:40.238
Please. I am begging you!
Please.

01:14:45.585 --> 01:14:49.589
This is my wife.
You just buy a house.

01:14:50.843 --> 01:14:52.939
For God's sake! Please. God!

01:14:53.907 --> 01:14:55.568
No. Mark!

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.146
Be a man!

01:14:58.668 --> 01:15:00.125
Be a man!

01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:04.931
Please.

01:15:18.286 --> 01:15:21.336
<i>You know how hard it will be to
the country if it is reveal.</i>

01:15:22.313 --> 01:15:24.601
The repercussions would
be catastrophic.

01:15:24.611 --> 01:15:27.761
The brother of a member the
government involved with pedophilia.

01:15:29.431 --> 01:15:32.891
The circle consists of people
important high society.

01:15:32.901 --> 01:15:37.163
We should suppress a precaution.
All of you are expendable.

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:41.312
Blunt approved the death
of his own brother. God!

01:15:41.322 --> 01:15:43.622
So. Why was not paid
to free Angel.

01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:47.739
Is it because Blunt became
a nobleman damned.

01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:49.598
Guilty!

01:15:50.185 --> 01:15:53.554
He found a man to pay for the
damages to the little girl.

01:15:54.461 --> 01:15:58.308
I was sure that could
be introduced in the society.

01:15:58.318 --> 01:15:59.805
He knew of the agreement.

01:15:59.815 --> 01:16:02.365
Go and be quiet.
Start a new life.

01:16:02.389 --> 01:16:05.802
- With everything closed.
- Good. Kill Angel.

01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:07.765
Why did your uncle live?

01:16:07.775 --> 01:16:09.425
This would put us in difficulty.

01:16:10.062 --> 01:16:13.212
She hid evidence at all places.
We could not risk on it.

01:16:14.467 --> 01:16:16.542
For God's sake! Bradbury!

01:16:16.552 --> 01:16:19.925
An innocent girl of 10
years in a family of civilians!

01:16:19.935 --> 01:16:24.029
She would rehabilitate before
to be returned to the system.

01:16:24.039 --> 01:16:25.837
Do you expect me?
To believe on it.

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:29.353
No matter what
believes. Bradbury!

01:16:29.363 --> 01:16:33.753
You did your job.
Got your promotion and move on!

01:16:33.763 --> 01:16:37.347
So. I must go quietly and
pretend that nothing happened.

01:16:37.357 --> 01:16:39.057
You know how the things work.

01:16:39.813 --> 01:16:42.895
She is collateral damage.
Is part of what we do?

01:16:42.905 --> 01:16:44.805
Have you seen this?
On the battlefield.

01:16:44.829 --> 01:16:47.132
In Iraq, Afghanistan.
It is all the same.

01:16:47.142 --> 01:16:50.276
It is not the same thing!
Is she dead?

01:16:50.926 --> 01:16:53.597
You made she disappear
like Lapslie and Angel.

01:16:53.607 --> 01:16:55.506
- See.
- Is she dead?

01:16:55.516 --> 01:16:57.165
- No!
- Prove!

01:17:20.058 --> 01:17:21.594
Can you see this?

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:23.772
I want you to remember that.

01:17:23.782 --> 01:17:26.721
- This is your fucking nightmare!
- I do not understand.

01:17:26.931 --> 01:17:28.737
Contains the video
of my testimony.

01:17:28.747 --> 01:17:32.290
All the pieces of information,
I found about this case.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:35.347
Secret documents and
espionage recordings.

01:17:35.957 --> 01:17:37.357
Photos.

01:17:40.142 --> 01:17:42.972
Now. Get out!

01:17:44.644 --> 01:17:47.783
If you run. I will spread
all over your brain.

01:18:02.653 --> 01:18:04.245

01:18:04.786 --> 01:18:06.186
Come on. Baby!

01:18:08.951 --> 01:18:11.526

<i>"Lord hall."</i>

01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:39.104
<i>I know that when you receive
this message to hear.</i>

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:42.105
<i>Along with its
obedient comrades.</i>

01:18:42.115 --> 01:18:44.367
<i>I know all about
what they were doing.</i>

01:18:44.377 --> 01:18:48.933
<i>Likely it must be distorted by
immoral and corrupt government.</i>

01:18:48.943 --> 01:18:51.168
<i>Regarded as an act of treason.</i>

01:18:52.136 --> 01:18:54.951
Look how she moves.
What arrogance of shit!

01:18:55.566 --> 01:18:57.733
She knows. She have traced
We watch her!

<i>Will I be the next

<i>People like you is a cancer.</i>

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:12.452
<i>They should not allow to conduct
the country. Locked you in a cage.</i>

01:19:12.476 --> 01:19:14.914
Come on! That is it.
Take her off!

01:19:15.077 --> 01:19:17.335
Take the target in the
cross hairs and shoot!

01:19:20.168 --> 01:19:24.250
<i>I gladly sacrificed my life
to defend the kingdom.</i>

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:28.375
<i>But I was removed when asked
to cover pedophiles.</i>

01:19:28.385 --> 01:19:31.382
<i>The most despicable forms
of life on the planet.</i>

01:19:31.914 --> 01:19:35.137
<i>So. Dear old friends.
The game over.</i>

01:19:35.147 --> 01:19:37.288
<i>I am guilty for revealing all.</i>
