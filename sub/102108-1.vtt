WEBVTT

01:14.378 --> 01:17.555
Anybody you meet

01:17.599 --> 01:20.384
Of their own

01:22.560 --> 01:26.564
To be lonely or sad

01:29.741 --> 01:34.703
You battle on

01:34.746 --> 01:37.097
You're livin' on

01:43.842 --> 01:49.544
Just a matter of time

02:03.862 --> 02:08.998
Near or far we are

02:16.832 --> 02:19.617
To be sorry for

02:20.096 --> 02:24.927
In a million eyes

02:52.520 --> 02:53.738
Good morning, Yoyo.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.349
Morning, Gene.
Has it started?

02:55.392 --> 02:57.525
They're waiting for you,sir. You better get changed.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.526
Okey-dokey.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.056
Would anyone like a drink
before we get started?

03:53.450 --> 03:54.495
No, thank you.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.801
Well, I'm going to make myself..

03:58.281 --> 03:59.630
a "suicide."

04:09.597 --> 04:12.556
Just a little bit of root beer,
traditional cola,

04:12.991 --> 04:14.341
just a touch
of lemon-lime spritz,

04:15.211 --> 04:18.301
orange up, and my
secret ingredient...

04:19.955 --> 04:22.218
just a dash of lemon-infused
iced tea.

04:24.351 --> 04:25.917
I like the extra bite.

04:32.359 --> 04:33.621
It's perfect.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.581
Is it ready?

04:37.625 --> 04:39.017
Finally, yes.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.411
After years of work,
I have developed

04:41.455 --> 04:43.718
genetically modified mosquitos

04:43.761 --> 04:45.807
and a way to control them.

04:49.463 --> 04:52.944
This remote here, activates
that receiver under the cow,

04:52.988 --> 04:55.556
releasing a signal attracting
the mosquitos.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.688
These are not just
itchy mosquito bites.

04:58.210 --> 05:01.039
One sting will kill
a large animal within minutes.

05:02.258 --> 05:05.217
So, hypothetically speaking,

05:05.261 --> 05:07.655
if the receiver was placed, say,

05:07.698 --> 05:10.919
in the middle of a small town,

05:10.962 --> 05:13.008
the mosquitoes
would then fly towards it

05:13.704 --> 05:16.446
stinging and killing everyone
in the town?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.363
-Hypothetically.
-Well,

05:20.407 --> 05:23.323
given that we have
thousands of mosquitos,

05:23.366 --> 05:25.499
we could kill
thousands of people

05:25.542 --> 05:27.588
but we don't
wanna do that, right?

05:29.024 --> 05:32.201
We're using these to kill
animals with rabies, right?

05:32.244 --> 05:33.898
In South Africa?

05:33.942 --> 05:37.337
There was a problem with rabid
herds of animals? You said?

05:39.382 --> 05:41.253
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

05:41.297 --> 05:44.605
You cannot get away with this!
My house is full of evidence!

05:45.562 --> 05:46.737
Yoyo.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.570
-Goodbye, Dr. Bradley.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.719
Now, no one can stop me.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.938
No one.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.818
Whenever
I watch those movies

06:23.861 --> 06:25.428
-where they're in the 1800s...
- Oh.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.387
I can't stop thinking,

06:27.430 --> 06:29.954
did everybody just--
Gosh, I don't wanna be rude--

06:30.215 --> 06:31.434
-Stink?
-Yes.

06:31.478 --> 06:32.870
Yes, I know.
I think about it all the time.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.350
-They didn't have deodorant!
-No.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.004
They didn't have toilets,
didn't brush their teeth!

06:36.047 --> 06:37.048
-Everyone had yellow teeth.
-Yeah.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.659
Yellow teeth was just
the regular color.

06:38.702 --> 06:39.921
-It was the norm.
-The regular color.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.575
-Yes, everyone had it.
-

06:41.618 --> 06:45.579
Make no conditions

06:48.712 --> 06:49.626
I had a dream

06:50.148 --> 06:51.759
that I made love with that man
on the Pringles can.

06:51.802 --> 06:54.065
-What flavor of Pringles was it?
-Plain. I like everything plain.

06:54.544 --> 06:55.763
-Plain Pringles are the best.
-Just plain.

06:55.806 --> 06:56.764
-Yeah.
-You know who I always

06:57.199 --> 06:59.288
-had a crush on? Mr. Peanut.
-Who? Oh, my gosh.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.029
-Something about him.
-But he's so smart.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.770
-He had that little monocle.
-And a top hat.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.989
-Love a man with a top hat.
-Me too.

07:05.816 --> 07:08.732
Go totally crazy...

07:08.776 --> 07:11.169
God, it's so funny to think
all the raccoons in the world

07:11.213 --> 07:12.388
-are sleeping right now.
-What?

07:12.867 --> 07:14.782
Listen, I don't really know more
than what I've already said.

07:14.825 --> 07:17.175
And some of what I said I'm not
even sure I actually know.

07:17.219 --> 07:19.003
Excuse me.
- Hi.

07:19.656 --> 07:22.224
-Do you work here?
- Yes. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.966
Great! 'Cause we're interested
in this couch you're sitting on.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.882
-Hmm, good. Okay.
-Um...

07:30.319 --> 07:31.799
-Okay...
-Here's the thing.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.757
-Um, okay.
-

07:34.628 --> 07:38.109
This couch is the floor model.
And it's the only one left.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.546
-I'm so sorry.
-So, I'm sorry.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.330
-It's soiled up pretty badly.
-Is there a discount

07:41.373 --> 07:42.984
-since it's the floor model?
-Oh.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.639
I'm sorry would you excuse us
just for one minute?

07:46.117 --> 07:47.423
Just a quick second.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.167
-Star.
-Barb, what are we gonna do?

07:52.210 --> 07:53.777
-This is our couch.
-We've told each other

07:53.821 --> 07:56.040
so many things on this couch.
Remember when you told me

07:56.084 --> 07:57.825
you were afraid
you were addicted to caramel?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.783
-Right here on this couch.
-Caramel squares.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.916
God, I'm glad that's over.
And it was on this couch

08:01.959 --> 08:03.483
you told me my husband
was having an affair

08:03.526 --> 08:05.746
-with Dina Rankusio.
-That was so hard for me.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.922
You're a good friend
for telling me. Some wouldn't.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.054
Well, I couldn't keep that in.
I would never lie to you.

08:10.098 --> 08:12.535
-I would never lie to you.
-Star.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.189
Excuse me, uh, ladies?

08:15.669 --> 08:17.366
Listen, the reason why
we're acting a little funny

08:17.409 --> 08:20.630
about this couch is because
well, we love it.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.806
It's the truth.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.547
We sit on it every day.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.680
It's, um, it's our talking
couch, you know?

08:27.158 --> 08:31.162
So, um, you're telling us not
to buy the couch

08:31.206 --> 08:34.818
because you wanna sit on it?
At work?

08:34.862 --> 08:37.473
-That's it. You get it. Yes.
-Yes. She gets it. Exactly.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.866
-That's exactly it.
-Thank you.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.695
Thank you for helping us.
That was very helpful.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.348
Thank you so much.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.046
-That's so nice of you.
-Oh, my gosh.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.178
-Okay. Look, that was close.
-That was the couch.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.572
-We should do something.
- We have to rip a hole...

08:49.616 --> 08:51.226
-Why don't we fart on it?
-Oh, yes. Let's fart.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.184
-Let's fart right now.
-

08:53.228 --> 08:54.925
Hi.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.231
I called you both

08:56.274 --> 08:58.407
in here today because...

08:59.451 --> 09:02.280
Wait, Star are you even
supposed to be working today?

09:02.716 --> 09:04.718
Oh, I always come in
when Barb works.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.068
She does the same. Don't worry,
you're not paying us double.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.417
Wait. I thought you were
working today.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.027
No! I thought
you were the one working.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.160
-Gosh, that's so funny.
-

09:12.726 --> 09:13.901
-It's not the first time...
-That this happened.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.206
Sometimes one of us
is on the schedule,

09:15.250 --> 09:16.643
-we both come in.
-We just come in.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.036
Alright. Look. This is very
difficult for me to do.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.344
But I need to tell you
that we're closing the store.

09:23.258 --> 09:24.912
-What?
-Oh, I think he means

09:24.955 --> 09:26.304
for renovations.
Oh my gosh.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.306
-Are we getting a juke box?
-Please tell me

09:28.350 --> 09:29.612
we're getting that jukebox.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.745
No, please stop asking me
about that.

09:32.484 --> 09:33.660
The store is closing for good.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.966
Apparently,
Jennifer Convertibles

09:36.010 --> 09:37.707
as a national chain

09:37.751 --> 09:42.799
closed about seven months ago
and nobody bothered to tell us.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.671
-So, what does that mean?
-What does that mean?

09:44.714 --> 09:46.760
I'm sorry,
I know you love it here.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.718
But the good news is that
the company

09:48.762 --> 09:50.415
-is giving you severance.
-No. Severance?

09:50.459 --> 09:52.374
-We don't wanna be severanced.
-No! Please!

09:52.417 --> 09:54.637
This job is our lives.
It's our purpose.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.247
Where are we
gonna host Thanksgiving?

09:56.291 --> 09:57.509
Well, you can--

09:58.206 --> 10:01.470
Wait, you come in here
when the store is closed

10:01.513 --> 10:03.472
and host
your Thanksgiving dinners?

10:08.216 --> 10:09.304
No.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.220
God I'm really upset.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.265
I can't believe we're not
gonna work here anymore.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.659
I'm grieving. I think...
I think I'm really grieving.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.269
Me too, but you know what?

10:18.313 --> 10:20.576
We'll find another job.
This small town's full of places

10:20.620 --> 10:22.622
looking to hire women
in their 40s.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.754
Yeah. That's the attitude!

10:25.581 --> 10:27.235
-We'll find something better.
-Yeah.

10:27.278 --> 10:30.238
I mean, we both
have high school degrees.

10:30.281 --> 10:31.805
-Well, you do.
-Well, I don't.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.763
-I thought you did.
-Well, I don't.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.594
-Well, what can we do?
- Ladies!

10:38.638 --> 10:39.856
Hi!

10:40.378 --> 10:42.119
Mickey.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.735
-You look amazing.
-You look great.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.388
-Wow.
-Miguel and I just got back

10:50.432 --> 10:51.781
from vacation.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.392
My dermatologist
is not gonna be happy with me.

10:54.436 --> 10:57.700
I soaked up some mega rays.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.789
Gosh, you can see it.
You look glowing.

10:59.833 --> 11:00.834
You look really dark.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.227
Girls, I might just pack up
and moved there.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.968
-What? Where?
- Where did you go?

11:05.403 --> 11:07.971
It's this tiny little oasis
on the coast of Florida.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.843
It's people like us.
Mid-lifers

11:09.886 --> 11:12.976
who still like to strut past
the pool and stop the party

11:13.020 --> 11:16.110
dead in its tracks with a tube
top and full jewelry.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.286
-Oh. Yeah.
- I'm not kidding.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.853
I feel like I got a soul-douche.

11:20.244 --> 11:22.203
-A soul-douche? Well...
-

11:22.246 --> 11:23.813
And not that I was looking,

11:23.857 --> 11:26.511
but there are so many
gorgeous men there.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.035
We're talking Tommy Bahama

11:28.078 --> 11:29.384
from head to toe.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.516
Tommy Bahama.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.562
Put that with a 24-hour CVS

11:33.605 --> 11:35.433
and you got yourself a party.

11:35.477 --> 11:38.785
I mean best week of my life.
You girls have got to go.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.874
-Well, not the best--
-Oh, yeah, no.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.266
-We're not--
-Time right now.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.354
We're not in a place

11:43.877 --> 11:45.008
-to really go anywhere.
-We can't really leave.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.357
I'll drop off a brochure later.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.969
-Oh, wow. Thank you.
-Oh, yeah.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.535
-That won't be necessary.
-I mean, yeah.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.233
It'd be nice to see
what it looks like.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.538
What's the name
of the place again?

11:53.582 --> 11:55.236
Vista Del Mar!

11:56.890 --> 12:00.023
-View of the swordfish.
-View of the mar.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.507
Before we begin
I just wanna thank

12:05.550 --> 12:08.597
Barb and Star for hosting
tonight's talking club

12:08.640 --> 12:10.599
and for making their famous,

12:11.208 --> 12:14.385
usual hot dog soup. Again.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.344
-You're welcome.
-It's a simple recipe.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.259
-Simple.
-Oh, Gail's not here,

12:18.302 --> 12:21.697
but it's 6:00 on the dot.
So, it's time to lock the door.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.267
- I'm here.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.095
You're late Gail, buh-bye.

12:30.575 --> 12:33.840
Well, Talking Club
is officially in session.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.973
I was really hoping to talk
this week about horses.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.106
Specifically my horse,

12:39.149 --> 12:41.021
and the spectacular time
we had--

12:41.064 --> 12:43.023
You know the rules, Delores.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.242
We only share about the topic

12:45.286 --> 12:47.244
that we pick out
of the talking jar.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.377
Give me your soup.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.606
Today's topic is...

13:03.652 --> 13:04.609
jobs.

13:06.307 --> 13:09.963
I wanted to talk about
my job at the Christmas store.

13:10.006 --> 13:13.053
I know everyone thinks
it's not busy right now,

13:13.096 --> 13:16.056
but we are... all year round.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.494
-I believe you.
-Thank you.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.888
Well, I love my job
at the pharmacy.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.542
I get to play with the pills,

13:24.586 --> 13:27.589
and sometimes I shake them
along to the music.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.418
Star, we can't tell the ladies
what happened today.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.507
What? You mean lie? We can't.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.901
Oh, we just lost our job
at the hottest place in town.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.554
-What will they think of us?
- Oh,

13:36.598 --> 13:37.991
and I love my uniform.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.427
It's all white,

13:39.470 --> 13:42.604
so I get to set myself apart
with character socks.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.085
-Those look fun.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.957
These have coffee cups
and coffee beans on them.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.568
I wish you dress me.
-I don't have time.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.875
Barb and Star?
What about you guys?

13:52.919 --> 13:55.095
I mean, you guys work at the
hottest place in town!

13:55.138 --> 13:57.010
Maybe socks
would be a good topic.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.186
Oh, yes. I love the socks
without ankle.

13:59.229 --> 14:02.102
Barb, Star, the topic is jobs.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.106
Tell us about your jobs.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.369
-Oh. Well...
-Oh.

14:09.109 --> 14:13.417
Uh... Today was...
-Uh, it was busy.

14:13.461 --> 14:14.375
-It was busy.
-Yeah.

14:14.766 --> 14:17.465
So, we had a lot of--
Big delivery.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.641
One big delivery.
-With furniture.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.164
-And sofa.
-Tables.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.600
There was a guy.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.428
He was delivering,
- He was tall.

14:24.689 --> 14:27.388
The other was shorter.
- Not as tall.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.520
We filled out paperwork.
-Inventory.

14:29.564 --> 14:30.652
Did everything.

14:31.261 --> 14:33.176
-Then we had to load it all in.
- To look at the samples.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.396
-...brought the samples.
- ...clipboard.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.789
Made some tea.
-We signed up.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.140
And then
we got a promotion.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.184
-Oh!
-What?

14:41.750 --> 14:43.447
-Wow!
-Congrats.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.232
Congratulations you guys!

14:45.275 --> 14:47.887
-Go home, Gail.
- We're so proud of you.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.410
We should do a toast.

14:52.108 --> 14:55.285
What? That's how
I cheers with my horse.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.510
Barb and I lost our jobs.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.557
Sorry. The store closed.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.082
And the story we just told you
about the delivery,

15:09.125 --> 15:11.127
the men coming,
the trucks, the nightstands,

15:11.171 --> 15:12.563
the fabric samples, the couches,

15:12.607 --> 15:15.131
the tall guy and the shorter guy
that wasn't as tall?

15:15.175 --> 15:16.959
-

15:17.003 --> 15:18.091
Oh, damn.

15:18.961 --> 15:23.139
We all know there are only three
major rules in Talking Club.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.229
Rule number one, no sneakers.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.972
Rule number two, no swearing
except for the "F" word.

15:30.755 --> 15:34.281
Rule number three, no lying.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.370
You two are banned
from the club.

15:36.413 --> 15:37.458
-What?
-What?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.764
Ladies, grab your
purses, and pocket books.

15:39.808 --> 15:42.332
No, Debbie, please.
-Isn't there like

15:42.376 --> 15:43.986
a three-strike rule
or something?

15:44.030 --> 15:46.380
Please, we won't do it again.
This is all we have left.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.077
-Can we have one more chance?
- One more chance.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.644
Please.
- It was just one lie.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.994
Give us a chance.
-We don't know what to say.

15:58.914 --> 16:02.222
Barb, are you upset with me?
I'm sorry I blurted it out.

16:02.265 --> 16:05.312
Star, no.
I can never be upset with you.

16:05.834 --> 16:09.359
It's okay, we lied.
We deserved it.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.929
Do you know
they make denim culottes?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.453
They're for our weather.

16:16.497 --> 16:18.238
Do you think
Jennifer Convertibles closing

16:18.281 --> 16:19.282
was a sign?

16:19.891 --> 16:21.719
And getting kicked out
of Talking Club?

16:22.459 --> 16:23.765
A sign?

16:24.809 --> 16:27.073
Okay. You know those days
when you see me

16:27.116 --> 16:29.118
-just staring at the carpet?
-Yes.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.946
Sometimes I daydream.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.427
About life
outside of this place.

16:34.950 --> 16:37.648
Maybe something is telling us
to do something different.

16:37.692 --> 16:40.347
-Oh, my gosh. Yes.
-Yes? Oh!

16:40.390 --> 16:42.827
Should we try those socks
with individual toes?

16:42.871 --> 16:44.133
-Yeah.
-What do they feel like?

16:44.177 --> 16:45.091
I've always wondered.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.050
I wonder how my toes will react.
They've always been together.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.312
I think they'll like it.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.445
-What if it's something bigger?
-Like what?

16:52.228 --> 16:54.839
-Like this.
-

16:54.883 --> 16:56.189
-A trip?
-Yes.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.799
-Star--
-No, look,

16:57.842 --> 17:00.019
look at these two people.
Look how happy they are.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.282
Imagine that's you and me
riding on that banana boat.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.979
Just bouncing around

17:04.023 --> 17:06.112
with our arms and legs
spread wide open

17:06.155 --> 17:08.940
with water and air
going all inside of us.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.464
This is dangerous.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.031
Things happen to people
on trips.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.510
What if we get lost,
or poisoned,

17:13.554 --> 17:15.556
or we get a rash?
What if they put us in jail

17:15.599 --> 17:17.210
'cause they think
we put drugs in our butts?

17:17.253 --> 17:18.515
What if we fall out of a car?

17:18.559 --> 17:20.648
Have you heard
of traveler's diarrhea, Star?

17:21.736 --> 17:25.783
Your stomach doesn't care where
you are, it just releases.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.785
Haven't you ever wondered
if the real ocean

17:27.829 --> 17:29.178
sounds like our noise machine?

17:29.222 --> 17:31.093
The real ocean
has strong currents.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.878
And people get swept out,
and they sink and they drown.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.099
Okay.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.711
I know things changed for you
after Ron died.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.713
They certainly did for me
after Carmine Left.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.889
But we used to have fun.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.675
Remember that one time
we went on a haunted hay ride?

17:47.718 --> 17:49.677
-And we got chased by that man

17:49.720 --> 17:51.505
with a Jack-o'-lantern head
and a chainsaw.

17:51.548 --> 17:52.854
And then we heard later

17:53.202 --> 17:55.378
he wasn't an actor, he just
escaped from the local prison.

17:55.422 --> 17:56.945
He was a real killer.
-Killer.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.816
-He was trying to kill us.
- Oh.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.341
Remember the 4th of July when
we roller skated through town

18:01.384 --> 18:02.907
in our sequined leotards?

18:02.951 --> 18:04.822
And my sparkler
caught your hair on fire?

18:04.866 --> 18:06.737
And then my hair
caught your hair on fire.

18:06.781 --> 18:09.697
We caught
each other's hair on fire.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.394
Oh.

18:13.918 --> 18:19.707
Barb, I feel like...
we lost our... shimmer.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.450
Isn't that just what happens
when you get older?

18:23.493 --> 18:25.582
No. I mean, it doesn't have to.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.976
We still have a chance
to be those people again.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.457
I mean,
look all of our stories.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.111
They're-- they're from the past.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.374
We don't
have any stories from now.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.379
I feel like we're fading away.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.121
I don't wanna fade away.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.384
Hey, look, I know you're afraid
something is gonna go wrong,

18:44.427 --> 18:46.734
but what if it doesn't?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.997
What if we go there
and have a time of our lives?

18:49.040 --> 18:51.042
We lay on the beach
and we feel the sun

18:51.086 --> 18:52.740
and we have breakfast
and have muffins

18:52.783 --> 18:54.481
and croissants
with all kinds of jelly--

18:54.524 --> 18:56.091
-Let's do it.
-What?

18:56.961 --> 18:59.703
I can't believe I'm saying this.
Let's throw caution to the wind

18:59.747 --> 19:01.314
like a couple
of rock and rollers!

19:01.357 --> 19:02.663
Really?
-Yes.

19:03.316 --> 19:04.665
-Barb.
-Star.

19:06.101 --> 19:08.190
Let's go to Vista Del Mar.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.064
I'm gonna bring those
culottes I bought at Kaboom.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.762
Culottes?
- My fringe shorts.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.242
Tangerine pants.
- Oh, my curlers.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.418
I don't want anything
to happen to my curlers.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.290
-Anyway--
- Cheese pizza.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.510
Gosh, let me
just get mushroom. Well.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.729
Traveler's checks.
Leftover from my wedding.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.644
For the shower.
Safety first.

19:27.688 --> 19:30.212
Always good to bring
a little piece of art

19:30.256 --> 19:32.083
-from home.
- We're gonna buy a lot

19:32.127 --> 19:33.346
-of Florida cookies.
- Some rope.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.782
This is gonna be
for the cheese pizza.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.131
My curlers.

19:36.827 --> 19:39.221
This is a toilet
scrubber and a back scrubber.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.832
Maybe it's time
to put the curlers in.

19:41.876 --> 19:44.052
Vista Del Mar...
- Here we come.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.279
What's on your mind?

19:53.583 --> 19:55.150
I'm just nervous
something is going to go wrong.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.196
I even tried
to distract myself today

19:57.239 --> 19:59.633
by training some of the mice
from the lab.

19:59.676 --> 20:02.462
Everything is going to be
fine. I promise.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.115
I want you to get there early.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.465
Get the lay of the land.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.118
Here's the microchip.

20:07.162 --> 20:09.904
The receiver cannot
be activated without it.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.298
Be very careful with it.
It's fragile.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.865
There's a compartment for it
in your belt.

20:15.344 --> 20:16.824
Yoyo designed it.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.869
God, I love that little boy...

20:19.827 --> 20:21.132
And most importantly...

20:22.003 --> 20:23.222
the antidote.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.397
You might get stung.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.703
This will make you
immune to the poison.

20:26.747 --> 20:30.359
-I won't let you down, my love.
-No, you won't.

20:32.970 --> 20:36.583
I've been working on this plan
my entire life.

20:37.888 --> 20:41.675
And now, it's finally time.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.807
I can't wait for all
of this to be over.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.853
After what those people
did to you,

20:45.896 --> 20:47.028
and for you to be happy,

20:48.072 --> 20:49.944
and for us to be
an official couple.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.124
Um...

20:59.910 --> 21:01.521
Mm-hmm. Yes.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.350
You do wanna be together, right?

21:05.394 --> 21:07.701
-Be an official couple?
-Mm-hmm.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.095
Yes, of course I do.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.575
I'm just, um,

21:12.619 --> 21:15.491
it's hard for me relax.
You know, until this is over.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.972
-You understand.
-Yeah.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.234
So...

21:20.627 --> 21:22.672
don't screw it up.

21:26.807 --> 21:28.374
Strings, you're still off.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.419
-

21:30.463 --> 21:31.551
The rest can have cheese.

21:37.426 --> 21:41.169
Woo! Well, I was not
prepared for that take off.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.257
Me neither.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.564
Ma'am, I apologize for screaming
at the top of my lungs.

21:44.607 --> 21:45.608
Mm.

21:46.479 --> 21:49.395
-What?

21:49.438 --> 21:51.658
I have got to read
this interview with Don Cheadle.

21:52.006 --> 21:54.443
Oh, I love him.
You know that reminds me,

21:54.487 --> 21:56.358
the other day
I said to myself...

21:56.402 --> 21:58.621
I cannot think of a famous
actress named Trish.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.102
You're kidding.
That's my favorite name.

22:01.145 --> 22:04.192
What? Mine too! How did we
never talk about this?

22:04.235 --> 22:08.631
To me, a woman named Trish
is a woman you can count on.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.547
Really has her act together.
Athletic, natural.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.984
Just real natural.
And loves the holidays.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.509
Trish? At Christmas? Forget it.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.075
She gets everybody a gift.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.773
-What about Halloween?
-Oh.

22:19.816 --> 22:22.253
Trish leaves a big pot
of candy for the kids.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.212
-Yeah.
- Because she trusts.

22:24.255 --> 22:25.561
- She'd be out

22:25.605 --> 22:27.041
-with her girlfriends.
- Country-dancing.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.695
She has a natural
sense of rhythm.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.349
She'd have one ear
double-pierced.

22:30.392 --> 22:31.915
-And the other...
-Just single.

22:33.003 --> 22:34.701
Once when I was applying
for a job at Talbots,

22:34.744 --> 22:36.964
-I told them my name was Trish.
-What?

22:37.007 --> 22:39.314
Well, remember when
I was in that hit and run

22:39.358 --> 22:40.663
-and that lady passed?
-Uh-huh.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.099
-Her name was Trish. Yeah.
-Really?

22:42.143 --> 22:44.101
Trish loses one of her
ears in a twister,

22:44.145 --> 22:46.277
-but not her hearing.
-She's a storm chaser.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.931
Her mom doesn't want her to be.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.716
-Their relationship is tough.
-Hmm.

22:49.759 --> 22:52.022
Trish always wanted to be
a portrait photographer.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.416
She loves people.
She would always say,

22:54.460 --> 22:56.679
"A person's face says
a lot about how they look."

22:56.723 --> 22:58.159
-Oh, that's beautiful.
-Yeah.

22:58.202 --> 22:59.378
Okay.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.901
-Trish's favorite number?
- Four.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.642
-Her favorite animal?
- Hen!

23:02.685 --> 23:04.426
-Trish's favorite movie?
-Oh.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.775
-Short Circuit.
-The Ring.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.476
And then she said,
"You know what, skin cancer?

23:11.302 --> 23:12.739
"You are not gonna take me.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.872
"Because I'm gonna take
my own life."

23:16.786 --> 23:17.744
And she did.

23:19.136 --> 23:22.226
She jumped off that cliff
near her house on the Cape.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.706
Dove right into the water,

23:24.446 --> 23:27.449
hitting every rock on the way.

23:27.493 --> 23:31.061
And now there's a beautiful
spirit out there in the ocean.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.847
And you know what her name is?

23:37.851 --> 23:39.287
It's Trish.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.464
Trish.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.749
I'm here.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.451
Oh, the air
feels different here.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.365
Oh, my God, you're right.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.455
Smells like Red Lobster.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.154
Look, it's the shuttle
for our hotel!

24:20.807 --> 24:22.286
Oh, my God.

24:47.181 --> 24:51.925
-Oh, my Star.
-Oh, my Barb.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.274
Let me take your bags, ma'am.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.058
-Check in's over there.

24:55.319 --> 24:56.538
Hope you had a nice flight.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.550
Come true here

25:08.594 --> 25:10.726
Is served with ice

25:13.076 --> 25:14.991
To please every member

25:23.739 --> 25:25.959
You can eat buffet

25:26.002 --> 25:27.874
With passion

25:36.883 --> 25:40.277
My turn will come around

25:41.191 --> 25:45.369
To win his sweetheart

25:45.413 --> 25:49.243
In this town

25:53.900 --> 25:55.815
From my divorce here

26:05.520 --> 26:10.960
Your freaking bell

26:11.004 --> 26:14.268
For your soul-douche

26:14.311 --> 26:17.445
Soul-douche
-

26:22.711 --> 26:25.714
The Palm...

26:29.892 --> 26:32.329
Stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

26:34.418 --> 26:37.247
Did you say Palm Vista Motel?

26:37.291 --> 26:38.466
Uh, yeah.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.338
No, Jerry! No.
You're late again.

26:41.382 --> 26:42.513
And the song is over.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.604
Ma'ams, I am so sorry,

26:45.647 --> 26:49.651
but this is the Palm Vista Hotel
Spa and Salon.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.741
You are clearly staying
at the Palm Vista Motel

26:52.785 --> 26:54.395
which is right outside the doors

26:54.438 --> 26:57.267
two football fields away
across the hot parking lot.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.399
So, have a good day.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.792
Can we stay here?

26:59.835 --> 27:01.489
You have any rooms?
We really like it here.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.491
Ladies, you can flirt with me
all you want,

27:03.534 --> 27:05.101
but it's not
gonna change my mind.

27:05.145 --> 27:07.234
There is absolutely
no vacancies.

27:07.582 --> 27:09.192
We are completely booked up

27:09.236 --> 27:11.760
because of this weekend's
Seafood Jam.

27:11.804 --> 27:12.848
Have a great day.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.199
Oh, brother.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.823
We'll, this looks nice too.

27:31.432 --> 27:34.087
Oh, look at that. Painting.

27:35.349 --> 27:37.873
Oh, hi. Hi.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.266
-Hi.
-Hi.

27:39.309 --> 27:41.747
We have a reservation
under Barb and Star.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.140
Okay, six nights?

27:44.184 --> 27:45.576
-Yup.
-Yup. Mm-hmm.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.230
Yeah. Do you want towels?

27:47.753 --> 27:49.929
-Yes, uh, yeah, uh-huh.
-Yeah I think so.

27:50.538 --> 27:51.800
Do you need sheets?

27:53.584 --> 27:56.413
-Probably.
-Yeah, for the bed.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.112
No pillows though, okay?

28:05.379 --> 28:06.728
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.558
-Gosh.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.126
This is peaceful.

28:14.562 --> 28:16.695
I like how the stains
everywhere look like designs.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.305
Oh, yeah.

28:18.348 --> 28:19.741
I am warm though.

28:19.785 --> 28:20.786
-Me too.
-Yeah.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.178
-I'm really warm.
-Yeah.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.225
I have an idea.
What if we go check out the pool

28:25.268 --> 28:27.053
-over at the nice hotel?
-Star.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.316
-Is that even legal?
-I honestly don't know.

28:31.057 --> 28:33.015
- Come.

28:34.495 --> 28:35.931
Oh. Woo.
- Whoa, gosh.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.628
Better get some water.
- My eyes--

28:37.672 --> 28:38.978
I don't see anything.

28:39.021 --> 28:41.458
Tomorrow

28:41.502 --> 28:44.592
That tomorrow

28:47.464 --> 28:50.119
tomorrow

28:50.163 --> 28:52.948
And the sorrow

28:58.127 --> 29:01.217
I just stick out my chin

29:10.357 --> 29:13.012
Mickey was right.
Everyone here is so friendly!

29:13.055 --> 29:15.101
I know.
Star?

29:15.144 --> 29:16.537
-What?
-That guy is waving at you.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.887
I think he likes you.
You should take a lover

29:18.931 --> 29:20.106
-on this trip.
-Barb,

29:20.584 --> 29:22.848
men are not attracted to me,
okay? The guy's just being nice.

29:22.891 --> 29:25.328
And Carmine was proof of that
when he left me for Dina!

29:25.372 --> 29:26.634
That is not true.

29:26.677 --> 29:28.897
Men find me disgusting,
and I'm okay with it.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.943
Star, if I said it once,
I said it a million times,

29:30.986 --> 29:32.335
you could model
for effin' Chico's,

29:32.379 --> 29:34.250
-and I'm not just saying that.
-Chico's?

29:34.294 --> 29:37.079
-Come on. I wish.
-Or Costco.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.733
I'm talking
the Kirkland brand.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.388
Kirkland? Oh, my God.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.085
Oh, my God.
-

29:43.912 --> 29:45.914
I think I'm gonna try
the frog's legs.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.307
What? Oh, gosh, I couldn't.

29:47.350 --> 29:48.874
Every time I think of frog legs

29:48.917 --> 29:50.353
I think of Kermit
riding his bicycle

29:50.397 --> 29:52.268
and how much he used his legs.
He really needed them.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.793
He did. Oh, I feel bad now.

29:54.836 --> 29:57.099
Okay. I'm gonna do
the veal-stuffed manatee.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.494
Ooh. I'm gonna try

30:00.537 --> 30:02.148
the fried bald eagle babies.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.454
-Oh, yum.
-Excuse me, ladies?

30:04.498 --> 30:05.542
Hi.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.936
Can I see you
out of the pool, please?

30:09.329 --> 30:10.417
We're so sorry.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.027
-Please. You're right.
-I knew this was gonna happen.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.943
-She said we'd go to jail.
-The other motel, it was so hot.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.379
-Stop!

30:16.423 --> 30:17.598
Ladies listen.

30:18.077 --> 30:21.080
There's been a cancellation
and we have a room available.

30:21.123 --> 30:22.081
-What? Here?
-What?

30:22.342 --> 30:23.996
It's not really a cancellation.

30:25.127 --> 30:26.825
The family that was in the room
is missing.

30:26.868 --> 30:27.826
Oh!

30:27.869 --> 30:29.349
It's probably the husband.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.786
It's always the husband.
He reported them missing,

30:31.830 --> 30:34.180
the next thing you know,
they're stuffed up in a chimney.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.791
Anyway, the room is yours,
if you'd like it.

30:41.187 --> 30:43.276
Yes. Yes, yes.

30:43.319 --> 30:44.930
Ooh, your voices
are really high.

30:59.814 --> 31:00.902
Oh, my God.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.686
-Look at this room!
- Woo.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.211
Star, did you see
that restaurant?

31:05.254 --> 31:06.516
-Oh, yeah.
-I'm so excited

31:06.560 --> 31:07.822
it's almost time for dinner!

31:07.866 --> 31:09.258
And time for a cocktail?

31:09.519 --> 31:11.173
-Star!
-Okay. You go in the bathroom,

31:11.217 --> 31:12.653
I'll lay out our bottoms
and tops!

31:12.696 --> 31:13.872
You know what
should wear tonight?

31:14.220 --> 31:15.917
Our evening culottes!

31:18.485 --> 31:20.966
Everything's going
according to plan, my love.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.663
I'm also missing you.

31:22.706 --> 31:25.579
There are lots of people here,
lots of official couples.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.233
Do you miss me?

31:28.451 --> 31:33.108
Oh, well, you're usually here.
And now you're not.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.849
And I know you're gone.

31:34.893 --> 31:38.331
And when you return,
you'll be back.

31:38.374 --> 31:39.593
Is that what you mean?

31:40.463 --> 31:42.117
-Never-mind.
-Oh, Edgar,

31:42.161 --> 31:43.902
I feel like I'm sensing
some 'tude.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.947
-No, no.
- I really must run.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.427
Yoyo and I have been playing
hide and seek

31:47.470 --> 31:49.472
and I haven't seen him
since last night.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.091
Good evening,
ladies and gentleman,

31:59.134 --> 32:00.527
I'm Richard Cheese.

32:03.443 --> 32:06.141
Around this place

32:19.198 --> 32:22.505
And chimichangas

32:26.466 --> 32:29.643
Up shirt potatoes

32:32.124 --> 32:33.168
Thank you.

32:33.212 --> 32:34.778
Oh, my, these are comfortable.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.476
Put another whiskey, please?

32:37.390 --> 32:40.393
-Room number again, please, sir?
-Six-eleven.

32:40.436 --> 32:44.353
Oh, 611? Oh, my-- Barb.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.442
Oh, my gosh! He's 611.

32:46.486 --> 32:48.879
Six-eleven? We're in 124!

32:51.317 --> 32:53.188
-We're in room 124.
-And you're...

32:54.233 --> 32:55.495
Wow.

32:56.191 --> 32:59.716
I'm Barb and this is Star,
and you are...

33:01.370 --> 33:02.806
Edgar.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.417
-Oh. Edgar.
-Nice.

33:07.550 --> 33:10.684
I'm sorry, I'm having a bad day.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.599
Oh, no.
Are you not going?

33:13.469 --> 33:14.905
That's what's happening with us.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.603
Traveling really stops you up.

33:16.646 --> 33:18.170
I mean, my stomach it's like

33:18.692 --> 33:20.999
just a bunch
of rolled up sacks in there.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.784
All in line trying to get out,
it's like a traffic jam.

33:23.827 --> 33:26.004
No, uh, work stuff.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.094
Oh, my gosh.
We have work stuff too!

33:29.137 --> 33:31.009
-We just lost our dream jobs.
- Yeah.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.488
It's been really hard.

33:33.054 --> 33:36.449
Star, why don't you cheer him up
with one of your greeting card

33:36.492 --> 33:38.059
-poems?
-Oh, Barb. Don't listen to her.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.930
-No. I'm so rusty, no.
-Come on.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.062
-Stop it.
-Come on.

33:41.106 --> 33:43.238
-Barb?
-Sorry, what is this?

33:43.282 --> 33:44.979
Star has a gift,
you should share it.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.807
Oh, it's nothing,
it's just a silly hobby I have.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.722
I like to make my own
greeting cards, specifically

33:48.765 --> 33:51.768
for the middle aged, you know,
because we go through stuff.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.857
-Don't be shy, come on.
-Barb, please.

33:53.901 --> 33:55.511
Do it, just do it.
Help this man.

33:55.555 --> 33:59.863
Just do one. Gosh.

33:59.907 --> 34:01.343
-You're gonna love this.
-Okay,

34:01.387 --> 34:03.345
-I'm gonna make it up.
- She's gonna make it up.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.086
-Okay.
- Nothing planned.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.610
She's thinking.
She's preparing.

34:07.654 --> 34:08.916
We can't force it.

34:09.569 --> 34:13.529
Sometimes life's umbrella
has holes in it,

34:15.662 --> 34:19.187
and the water just pours
all over your shoulders

34:19.231 --> 34:22.060
-and your hair.
-All right.

34:22.712 --> 34:25.324
But don't worry,
because the rain will end.

34:26.455 --> 34:29.371
But you should also get
a replacement umbrella

34:29.415 --> 34:30.720
for the next time.

34:32.635 --> 34:35.551
Was that okay?
I was so nervous!

34:35.595 --> 34:37.858
I don't know how she does it.
Words just...

34:37.901 --> 34:40.295
fall out of her,
like, air comes out of a...

34:41.557 --> 34:42.993
-See, I can't do it.
-Anyway,

34:43.037 --> 34:44.647
I hope it helped a little.

34:44.691 --> 34:47.259
Yeah, it did actually, yeah.
Thank you.

34:47.302 --> 34:48.303
See?

34:49.217 --> 34:51.089
-See?
-All right.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.875
Thank you so much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.398
I'll be right back, thank you.

34:57.051 --> 34:58.879
Okay. I'm back.
Thank you.

35:01.273 --> 35:03.275
-My turn to pick the drink.
-Okay.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.581
Okay. Ooh, George,
what's this drink

35:05.625 --> 35:07.192
with the skull
and crossbones over it?

35:07.235 --> 35:09.019
Can we get one of those?

35:13.937 --> 35:15.374
It's called The Buried Treasure.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.550
Yo-ho-ho.
-No one's ever finished

35:17.593 --> 35:18.551
the whole thing.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.075
But if you get to the bottom,

35:21.119 --> 35:22.337
there's a real treasure.

35:24.774 --> 35:26.776
You sure you guys wanna do this?

35:26.820 --> 35:28.126
-Yeah.
- Yes.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.518
-Okay.
- I love treasures.

35:29.562 --> 35:31.172
Yes.
-Yeah.

35:33.174 --> 35:36.134
My carnivorous habit

35:40.399 --> 35:41.748
You finished that already?

35:41.791 --> 35:42.836
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Yeah.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.838
Just for the record,
we never found the treasure.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.274
You found the chest
at the bottom

35:46.796 --> 35:48.102
-with the syrupy liquid?
- Yeah.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.538
-We licked it up.
-All the syrup.

35:49.582 --> 35:50.626
-Let's go.
-You open up

35:51.018 --> 35:52.237
the scuba diver's mask
and found the three pills?

35:52.280 --> 35:53.499
-Uh-hmm.
-I took a pill.

35:53.542 --> 35:54.848
-I had one.
-I had a pill.

35:54.891 --> 35:59.635
Oh, well, that's you...
treasure.

36:04.771 --> 36:09.732
With an onion slice

36:10.864 --> 36:15.434
Not too precise

36:41.634 --> 36:44.550
I like looking at wicker,
but I don't like sitting at it.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.161
Hmm.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.476
Hello, it's me.
Of course, you didn't answer.

36:57.519 --> 36:59.739
I'm getting sick of these...

37:00.566 --> 37:04.700
mixed messages,
so I've met two young--

37:05.832 --> 37:08.530
two middle-aged lady friends.

37:08.574 --> 37:11.664
If you don't start giving me
this respect thing soon...

37:11.707 --> 37:15.145
And the mission is off.

37:49.397 --> 37:50.790
-

37:54.663 --> 37:56.099
-Did we all--
-Yes.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.188
A lot of times.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.626
I just got
your message, my darling.

38:00.669 --> 38:03.324
Let's not talk such nonsense
about completing the mission.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.413
You know it's hard for me
to show it,

38:05.457 --> 38:07.894
but I love you deeply.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.200
I know I rode you guys
like a couple of horses.

38:10.244 --> 38:12.551
-Oh. That's why...
-There up and down the hallway.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.030
-...my back's a little sore.
-Yeah.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.336
-That's why my back--
-It might be sore

38:15.380 --> 38:17.164
from all you did
against the table.

38:17.207 --> 38:19.209
-It was two against one there.
-Well, that's true.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.299
Miss you.
Kiss with tongues.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.431
We really used the room
today and our bodies.

38:23.475 --> 38:26.956
Bye, guys. Thanks very much
for the, um, great time.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.784
-Oh, Edgar. Goodbye.
-Hey, come on.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.264
-Come on.
-Goodbye to you.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.483
Have a great day.
- Bye.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.485
-Bye.
- Goodbye.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.791
-Oh, great.
-

38:35.835 --> 38:37.445
-Oh.
-Well, okay.

38:38.011 --> 38:41.580
Oh, gosh I have to admit
I do feel kind of funny.

38:41.623 --> 38:43.059
Was it because
I spanked your bottom?

38:43.103 --> 38:44.800
I think it's because
he's the first man

38:44.844 --> 38:46.672
I've been with,
you know, since Carmine left.

38:46.715 --> 38:49.239
-Oh, I know how you feel.
-Yeah.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.198
I haven't been with anyone
since Ron.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.547
-You know that.
-Yeah.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.289
-Oh.
-Edgar was nice though.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.508
-I mean--
-Oh, my gosh.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.640
What a nice man.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.251
-Was such a nice man.

39:08.824 --> 39:11.349
My God! The shop--
- The shopping here.

39:11.392 --> 39:14.047
I love that magnet I got
that says "Flip Flop Zone"

39:14.090 --> 39:15.701
in wacky letters?
I wanna look at it.

39:15.744 --> 39:17.616
That ones in the bag that says
Pookie McNally's Trinket Hut.

39:17.659 --> 39:19.182
-It's the yellow one.
-Oh, yes.

39:19.226 --> 39:20.706
That's where I got
my new phone case.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.925
I love it.
-It's like I'm listening

39:22.969 --> 39:24.318
-to the ocean.
- I love it.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.799
-We don't have cell phones.
-Oh, no, I'm gonna take it home

39:26.842 --> 39:28.670
-and glue it to our land line.
-That's clever.

39:28.714 --> 39:31.194
-I can't believe we found this.
- That's going on our car.

39:31.238 --> 39:33.327
Do you know what
my favorite thing is?

39:33.371 --> 39:34.981
Friendship bracelets?
-Yes.

39:35.024 --> 39:36.765
I can't believe
these were only three dollars.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.680
It's a keepsake,
it's a keepsake for life.

39:40.465 --> 39:41.596
-It's a little sharp though.
-They are sharp.

39:41.988 --> 39:43.598
-They're a little sharp.
-Getting my skin a little bit.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.208
We'll break it in.
It'll wear down over time.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.732
Yeah.
-Star.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.299
A glass bottom boat?

39:49.343 --> 39:51.084
-Let's see what time it leaves.
-Let's go fast.

39:51.432 --> 39:53.129
We gotta hurry. Oh, God!
- Okay.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.696
Sea shells!
- What? Gosh.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.611
It's a freakin' clam
with googly eyes.

40:08.710 --> 40:09.842
Ready to party?

40:26.336 --> 40:27.555
You imbecile!

40:27.599 --> 40:28.861
I can fix this, I can.

40:28.904 --> 40:30.906
-Fiddlesticks.
-Please, just let me try.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.560
I won't mess up again.
Please don't worry.

40:32.604 --> 40:33.779
Oh, I won't.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.738
I know if I need
to count on someone,

40:36.782 --> 40:39.393
there's another man
I could call.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.308
What?
What man?

40:41.351 --> 40:43.353
Let's just say
when it comes to spies,

40:43.397 --> 40:45.225
I know he won't let me down.

40:45.268 --> 40:47.575
Now, you listen to me
and you listen good.

40:47.619 --> 40:50.143
You work for me,
do you get that?

40:50.186 --> 40:52.450
You are my employee
and nothing more

40:52.493 --> 40:55.017
until this gets done.
Now, if you'll excuse me

40:55.061 --> 40:56.932
I have a long distance
phone call to make.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.630
No, wait, wait. No!

40:58.673 --> 41:00.501
Wait, wait! No!
Hello?

41:09.292 --> 41:13.296
In a pan on a stove

41:13.340 --> 41:16.169
To the max

41:16.212 --> 41:19.955
As just fast as I can

41:23.916 --> 41:27.572
To kick up the sand

41:29.617 --> 41:34.100
That's raging inside me

41:34.143 --> 41:37.843
Can you hear my prayer

41:37.886 --> 41:41.673
But I'm getting nowhere

41:41.716 --> 41:45.633
Under her spell

41:45.677 --> 41:50.029
Or am I in hell

41:51.596 --> 41:54.816
From my heart

41:54.860 --> 41:58.603
My legs spread apart

41:58.646 --> 42:02.563
Like a baby ballerina

42:02.824 --> 42:06.306
With the force of his feet

42:08.134 --> 42:12.355
Like a cat up a palm tree

42:12.399 --> 42:16.708
To go up a palm tree

42:16.751 --> 42:20.407
Can you hear my prayer

42:20.450 --> 42:24.280
But I'm getting nowhere

42:24.324 --> 42:28.241
Under her spell

42:28.284 --> 42:34.290
Or am I in hell

42:56.922 --> 43:03.711
Ooh
-

43:07.019 --> 43:10.631
Can you hear my prayer

43:10.675 --> 43:14.504
But I'm getting nowhere

43:14.548 --> 43:18.421
Under her spell

43:18.465 --> 43:22.991
I know

43:34.133 --> 43:36.962
Phew! Well, I gotta be honest,

43:37.484 --> 43:39.399
I don't think I can do
another night like last night.

43:39.442 --> 43:41.401
Oh.
-

43:41.444 --> 43:42.968
Me neither. My gosh.

43:43.577 --> 43:45.623
Although, you know,
Edgar was so nice.

43:45.666 --> 43:46.798
Who?

43:47.276 --> 43:50.192
Oh, um-- Oh, was it Edgar?
What was his-- that man's name?

43:50.453 --> 43:52.542
-Oh, I don't know.
-Hmm.

43:52.586 --> 43:54.196
-Oh, right. Edgar.
- Yeah.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.415
From last night.

43:55.458 --> 43:57.504
Oh, I wasn't thinking
about him anymore.

43:57.547 --> 43:58.984
I forgot him.

43:59.027 --> 44:01.726
Me too. Yeah, I should forget
all about him.

44:02.944 --> 44:04.554
I think I just
wanna stay in tonight.

44:04.598 --> 44:07.035
Sit on the patio
and practice my calligraphy.

44:07.079 --> 44:08.384
Maybe write a poem.

44:08.428 --> 44:10.691
And just have a couple
of wheat thins,

44:10.735 --> 44:12.606
-and just cool it.
- Oh, that's a nice idea.

44:12.954 --> 44:13.999
And I'm gonna take a bath.

44:14.521 --> 44:16.610
-Oh. I won't disturb you.
-And I will not disturb you.

44:17.742 --> 44:19.482
-Okay.
- I'm gonna get my stuff.

44:19.526 --> 44:20.701
Oh, here's my pen.

44:36.064 --> 44:37.544
Okay, I'm in the tub now.

44:41.417 --> 44:44.116
Dearest Edgar,
I hope you remember me.

44:44.159 --> 44:45.987
I'm the disgusting woman
from last night.

44:46.031 --> 44:47.423
Oh, gosh.

44:47.467 --> 44:50.035
Barb says I shouldn't
describe myself that way.

44:50.078 --> 44:53.168
You should know that
I've been hurt in the past.

44:53.212 --> 44:55.301
I'm a broken woman.

44:56.781 --> 44:58.652
I haven't written
my feelings down in so long,

44:58.696 --> 45:00.436
but, gosh,
you lit a fire in me

45:00.480 --> 45:02.569
and I am raging with passion
right now.

45:04.614 --> 45:06.486
Okay? Where do I begin?
Um...

45:07.356 --> 45:11.317
I was born in a hospital...

45:16.104 --> 45:17.758
Ah. I get it.

45:21.806 --> 45:23.677
-Hello?
- Edgar Paget?

45:24.417 --> 45:27.289
-Uh, who is this?
- Never mind you.

45:28.247 --> 45:29.683
-Uh, what?
- For the purpose

45:29.727 --> 45:32.120
of our relationship,
I shall remain anonymous.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.470
I'm an associate
of you know who.

45:34.514 --> 45:37.778
Oh. Um...
hello.

45:37.822 --> 45:39.954
I understand
you lost the microchip.

45:39.998 --> 45:42.000
You are in a bit of a conundrum.

45:42.043 --> 45:44.785
Fortunately, I'm the man
with the means to replace it.

45:44.829 --> 45:47.875
Don't ask me what they are.
That's private.

45:48.876 --> 45:50.573
-Okay.
- You'll hear from me.

45:50.617 --> 45:52.662
Wait for my call
from this private number

45:52.706 --> 45:55.056
I'm calling you from
right now privately.

45:55.883 --> 45:57.493
Actually, you know what,
you came--

45:57.537 --> 45:58.756
you came up on my--
on my phone.

45:59.147 --> 46:00.975
I'm sorry. What?
- Your number actually

46:01.019 --> 46:02.542
came up on my phone.

46:03.412 --> 46:06.633
Well, don't look at it again.

46:06.676 --> 46:08.766
-I won't?
- Don't call it.

46:08.809 --> 46:10.202
I'm very private.

46:10.245 --> 46:12.291
-And don't give to anyone.
-Who will I give it to?

46:12.334 --> 46:14.380
Listen, um,
when the number comes up,

46:14.423 --> 46:16.556
does it happen to say
the name Darlie Bunkle?

46:17.339 --> 46:19.472
Uh, no. Is that your name?

46:19.515 --> 46:21.039
Damn it!

46:22.388 --> 46:23.389
What was that noise?

46:23.911 --> 46:25.870
Don't tell him it's me
on the phone. Darlie Bunkle.

46:25.913 --> 46:28.524
-Capital D-A-
-Oh, listen, I have to go.

46:28.568 --> 46:29.656
No, I have to go.

46:35.618 --> 46:36.619
Shit.

46:42.887 --> 46:43.844
Hey.

46:44.976 --> 46:46.020
Hi.

46:48.675 --> 46:51.286
I've been thinking about you
ever since this morning.

46:57.727 --> 46:59.904
-Shall I come in?
-Uh... no, no, no.

46:59.947 --> 47:01.383
-Wait. Sorry. Um...
-Oh

47:01.427 --> 47:03.168
I got like work stuff
everywhere. It's a real mess.

47:03.211 --> 47:05.387
That's okay. I only have
a few minutes anyways.

47:05.431 --> 47:07.259
-Star thinks I'm in the tub.
-No, no. Wait, wait.

47:07.302 --> 47:09.261
Um, not here. Not here.
Let's not do it here.

47:09.304 --> 47:11.654
Let's, um... Let's go for a walk

47:11.698 --> 47:13.656
-What?

47:13.700 --> 47:15.049
-Okay.
- Okay.

47:16.094 --> 47:18.531
There's probably a lot
you wanna know about me.

47:18.574 --> 47:20.968
My husband's name
was Ron Quicksilver.

47:21.012 --> 47:22.317
He was a rodeo star.

47:23.101 --> 47:26.147
He was so manly, there were
rumors he was chemically off.

47:26.191 --> 47:27.888
He was the love of my life.

47:29.194 --> 47:32.023
All I'm grateful for
is he died a quick death.

47:32.632 --> 47:33.851
He was trampled.

47:34.764 --> 47:37.071
-Oh, no. By a bull?
-No.

47:37.115 --> 47:39.639
It was a bunch of shoppers at
the Stereo Hut on Black Friday.

47:39.682 --> 47:41.641
They had 50-inch flat screens
for $199.

47:42.903 --> 47:44.470
I did get one.

47:46.994 --> 47:49.692
I realized
your worst fears can come true.

47:50.476 --> 47:54.132
And I think maybe when Ron died,
I stopped living too. I mean,

47:54.175 --> 47:55.742
-I didn't really stop living.
-

47:55.785 --> 47:57.439
I'm not dead.
I'm not a ghost.

47:57.483 --> 47:58.963
But after
that wild night with you,

47:59.006 --> 48:00.703
something shifted in me,
you know?

48:01.443 --> 48:03.358
Something's changing. I...

48:03.402 --> 48:05.534
I wanna look at life
for the first time again

48:05.578 --> 48:06.666
like a baby.

48:07.101 --> 48:11.105
Gosh, I wanna be a baby again.
I was so flexible then.

48:11.149 --> 48:12.759
Star went as a baby
for Halloween once.

48:12.802 --> 48:14.979
She wore a diaper.
Only a diaper.

48:15.022 --> 48:16.937
She won best costume.

48:18.112 --> 48:21.072
Oh, my gosh.
Star, she thinks I'm in the tub.

48:22.203 --> 48:24.597
I lied to her
and I've never done that before.

48:25.554 --> 48:29.558
God, I'm a terrible friend.
I wasted all that water.

48:31.343 --> 48:35.390
Edgar, I'm sorry.
This can't happen.

48:37.131 --> 48:38.524
We weren't mean to be.

48:39.177 --> 48:41.919
You've set me free,
and that's all this was.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.226
Thank you, Edgar.
Thank you!

48:46.140 --> 48:47.402
You're welcome?

48:47.446 --> 48:49.927
Everything is possible!

48:54.975 --> 48:56.759
Oh, look at her.
She's asleep.

48:59.980 --> 49:00.938
Star!

49:02.722 --> 49:03.723
Star!

49:05.333 --> 49:08.075
Okay. You're probably exhausted
from writing.

49:09.207 --> 49:12.079
Anyway, sweet dreams.
Good night, Star.

49:15.865 --> 49:17.171
I'm just so grateful for you!

49:17.215 --> 49:18.607
Gosh darn it,
you're a good friend.

49:18.651 --> 49:20.958
That's all.
Good night, Star!

49:30.141 --> 49:31.142
Hi.

49:32.491 --> 49:33.492
Hi.

49:39.498 --> 49:41.282
I started writing you a letter,
but then,

49:41.326 --> 49:43.023
my gosh, I was thinking
about you so much,

49:43.067 --> 49:45.460
my brain just
got all squirrelly.

49:45.504 --> 49:47.419
I just...
wanted to come over and...

49:48.637 --> 49:50.726
talked to you inside
where your sheets are.

49:55.079 --> 49:56.776
His name is Carmine Testaviglio.

49:56.819 --> 49:59.213
I should've known he was
having an affair with Dina.

49:59.257 --> 50:01.085
I didn't stand a chance.

50:01.128 --> 50:04.566
Carmine had a foot fetish,
and Dina has huge toes.

50:05.219 --> 50:07.091
My toes stopped growing
after I was three months old.

50:07.134 --> 50:09.745
They're like little pieces
of rice. I'm not kidding.

50:10.659 --> 50:12.661
-Oh, God, don't look.
-I wasn't.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.233
Now, when someone
leaves you, you just think,

50:19.277 --> 50:20.974
"So there must be
something wrong with me."

50:21.018 --> 50:22.932
So I just figured
I'm disgusting.

50:22.976 --> 50:25.761
But that night with you
was the first time since Carmine

50:25.805 --> 50:27.763
I felt non-disgusting.

50:28.590 --> 50:30.592
I mean, you saw
my folds and holes

50:30.636 --> 50:32.594
-and you didn't run away.
-

50:32.986 --> 50:34.640
Now, I'm just starting
to realize that maybe

50:34.683 --> 50:36.816
having meaningless flings
is the way to go.

50:37.338 --> 50:39.427
No one gets hurt.
No strings attached.

50:40.602 --> 50:43.562
It's just you shouldn't have
to try to make someone love you.

50:43.605 --> 50:45.433
That's all.
I don't know.

50:47.740 --> 50:49.046
I know what you mean.

50:50.003 --> 50:51.004
You do?

50:54.051 --> 50:56.923
Plus, you put all your faith
in someone and, poof,

50:57.619 --> 50:59.621
they turn out
to be someone else.

50:59.665 --> 51:01.493
I once heard this story
about a woman

51:01.536 --> 51:03.712
who married a doctor,
turns out

51:03.756 --> 51:05.453
he was Bruce Springsteen.

51:05.497 --> 51:07.412
I guess he just wanted
to be a regular person

51:07.455 --> 51:09.066
for a little while or something.

51:09.631 --> 51:11.416
I remember one year
for Halloween,

51:11.459 --> 51:13.200
Barb went as Bruce Springsteen.

51:14.027 --> 51:16.073
Oh, my God. Barb.

51:17.030 --> 51:19.467
What am I doing?
She thinks I'm sleeping.

51:19.511 --> 51:22.427
I lied to her, and I think
she might have feelings for you.

51:22.470 --> 51:25.082
-Oh, no. I don't think she--
-I've been a terrible friend.

51:25.125 --> 51:26.779
And I ruined that pillow.

51:27.823 --> 51:30.174
Oh, Edgar...
I should go.

51:30.739 --> 51:32.524
Which means
we don't have a lot of time.

51:32.567 --> 51:34.003
Gosh, I need you inside me.

51:34.047 --> 51:36.615
Let's go make love against
those hard wooden stairs.

51:42.490 --> 51:45.841
Edgar. Oh, thanks for letting me
talk through this

51:45.885 --> 51:47.495
and letting me
ride you like that.

51:47.539 --> 51:50.107
Now, I get meaningless sex.

51:50.150 --> 51:52.413
It feels good physically,
and that's all.

51:52.457 --> 51:53.849
Star that was...

51:56.678 --> 51:57.897
that was amazing.

52:00.160 --> 52:02.162
I mean, it was really,
really different.

52:02.206 --> 52:04.208
-Did I bounce too much?
-No.

52:04.251 --> 52:05.252
Oh, good.

52:06.210 --> 52:07.515
That was so lovely.

52:08.560 --> 52:09.996
Listen, I really
have to get back.

52:10.039 --> 52:11.911
Barb, can never know about this.

52:11.954 --> 52:13.434
Gosh, gotta go.

52:16.394 --> 52:18.874
-Let's do it one more time.
-Oh, yup. Yup. Please.

52:39.765 --> 52:42.855
-

52:50.341 --> 52:51.690
What are you doing?

52:53.344 --> 52:54.954
Oh, I was just playing
with this lamp.

52:54.997 --> 52:57.043
- I got a little reflux.

52:57.086 --> 52:58.218
And I tried to wake you,

52:58.262 --> 53:00.089
but I saw you put a pillow
in the bed.

53:00.133 --> 53:03.223
Was that just a funny joke?
I laughed but then I wondered.

53:03.571 --> 53:05.921
Oh, um, I just didn't wanna
make you up.

53:06.705 --> 53:10.274
You know, I didn't know
how long I was gonna be out.

53:10.317 --> 53:11.579
Oh, thank God.

53:12.014 --> 53:14.321
I thought maybe you went down
to the ocean and got swept away.

53:14.365 --> 53:16.018
Where did you go?

53:16.062 --> 53:17.672
I just went out
to clear my head.

53:17.716 --> 53:20.936
You know, get some of that
salty breeze in my lungs.

53:20.980 --> 53:23.243
-Okay.
-And went for a walk with...

53:25.854 --> 53:27.029
a turtle.

53:28.248 --> 53:29.597
-A turtle?
-You know, I just

53:29.902 --> 53:33.732
wanna make sure he was safe,
so I-I-- made sure he got home.

53:34.254 --> 53:36.778
You went to a turtle's house?

53:36.822 --> 53:38.389
I went to a turtle's house.

53:38.432 --> 53:40.347
Where do they
live around here?

53:40.391 --> 53:43.002
How was your bath?

53:43.611 --> 53:44.656
Oh.

53:45.961 --> 53:48.050
-It was good. Good tub.
-Good.

53:48.573 --> 53:51.445
I just stayed in there,
the whole time.

53:51.489 --> 53:52.881
Well, good for you.

53:52.925 --> 53:57.146
Well, I was really relaxed,
and the water was warm.

53:57.190 --> 53:59.714
And I...

54:01.020 --> 54:02.500
saw a turtle.

54:02.543 --> 54:04.415
In the tub?

54:04.458 --> 54:05.764
Yup. A baby one.

54:05.807 --> 54:07.679
He just floated up
out of the drain,

54:07.722 --> 54:10.029
and he swam around,
and he splashed me.

54:10.072 --> 54:11.291
And I tried to pet him,

54:11.335 --> 54:13.250
-but he got scared.
-'Cause your big?

54:13.293 --> 54:15.817
So much bigger than him.
He went back down.

54:15.861 --> 54:19.038
And, uh, anyway, that's why
you can't see him right now.

54:19.952 --> 54:21.649
-Wow.
-

54:23.085 --> 54:24.391
We should probably hit the hay.

54:24.435 --> 54:26.175
Yes. Let's go to bed.
I'm tired.

54:29.309 --> 54:32.312
Anyway, I'm so happy
to be here with you.

54:32.356 --> 54:34.488
Well, I'm so happy
to be here with you.

54:35.533 --> 54:37.665
-Good night.
-Good night, Star.

55:04.431 --> 55:05.737
Yoyo.

55:06.607 --> 55:08.174
-I love it.
-

55:08.217 --> 55:10.132
I'm so happy I built you
that craft room.

55:10.916 --> 55:13.353
Now, let's go over the plan
one last time.

55:13.397 --> 55:15.137
-Are you ready?
-Why does this plan

55:15.181 --> 55:16.617
mean so much to you, huh?

55:16.661 --> 55:18.924
Oh, Yoyo.

55:20.882 --> 55:22.231
Bring me my chair.

55:22.928 --> 55:24.103
Where shall I begin?

55:25.409 --> 55:27.019
I was born here in Taylorsville.

55:27.933 --> 55:31.023
I was also born with a skin
condition the doctors called

55:31.066 --> 55:35.157
pigmentatia-degenera-hysterica- whiteskinika.

55:35.201 --> 55:36.985
Is it serious?

55:37.029 --> 55:39.597
It is serious. You have
to take care of yourself.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.250
You have to stay
out of the sunlight.

55:41.294 --> 55:43.862
Leaving me
forever allergic to the sun.

55:43.905 --> 55:46.995
When I was seven years old,
my father got a job

55:47.039 --> 55:48.780
that would change our lives.

55:48.823 --> 55:50.738
We packed up and moved
to a small town

55:50.782 --> 55:52.305
in Florida called...

55:53.654 --> 55:55.221
Vista Del Mar.

55:56.091 --> 55:58.572
At my new school,
everyone made fun of me

55:58.616 --> 56:00.182
because of the way
that I looked.

56:00.226 --> 56:01.532
They would call me names like...

56:01.575 --> 56:02.707
-pale girl...
-Pale girl.

56:03.011 --> 56:04.796
...white devil...
-White devil.

56:04.839 --> 56:06.537
...and asshole.
-Asshole.

56:07.146 --> 56:09.366
I finally made one friend.

56:09.409 --> 56:11.716
Her name was Maria Margolis.

56:12.978 --> 56:14.936
She would stay inside with me.

56:14.980 --> 56:17.461
We would read
and create inventions,

56:17.504 --> 56:18.897
cook food from her culture.

56:19.506 --> 56:21.943
Then one day as we were walking to hercasa,

56:21.987 --> 56:23.554
through the Vista Del Mar
swamps,

56:25.556 --> 56:28.385
an alligator jumped out
of the water and ate Maria

56:28.428 --> 56:30.822
-right in front of me.
-

56:30.865 --> 56:32.389
Really gobbled her up.

56:34.826 --> 56:36.741
She was my last friend.

56:37.655 --> 56:39.787
Years later,
my father convinced me

56:39.831 --> 56:43.835
to go to Vista Del Mar's
annual Seafood Jam.

56:44.444 --> 56:46.577
I remember looking up
on the stage

56:46.620 --> 56:48.405
at the four young pretty girls.

56:48.927 --> 56:51.582
One of them about to be crowned
the new Shrimp Queen.

56:53.018 --> 56:54.454
And then all of a sudden...

56:55.194 --> 56:56.761
a group of popular girls

56:56.804 --> 56:58.763
from my school
pushed me on to the stage...

57:00.286 --> 57:03.507
...ripping my hat off, replacing it with a fake crown.

57:03.550 --> 57:05.073
-No. No.
- Father was trying

57:05.117 --> 57:07.075
to get to the front,
but he couldn't

57:07.119 --> 57:08.773
before the elderly mayor
mistook me

57:08.816 --> 57:11.602
for the actual Shrimp Queen and proceeded with the tradition.

57:12.341 --> 57:14.431
He shoved me
into the human cannon.

57:15.301 --> 57:20.306
Then one of the girls turned the dial all the way up.

57:20.349 --> 57:22.090
I was shot out into the ocean.

57:24.179 --> 57:25.659
As I rocketed
through the air,

57:25.703 --> 57:28.227
the force of the wind
ripped off all of my clothes.

57:28.836 --> 57:30.621
And I landed in the water...

57:30.664 --> 57:32.013
of a pool...

57:33.014 --> 57:35.321
-of a Disney Cruise Ship.
-

57:35.364 --> 57:38.019
And there I was,
a laughing stock.

57:38.063 --> 57:41.762
Bobbing in the water like
a ball of fresh mozzarella.

57:43.285 --> 57:45.331
From all the guilt
and the stress,

57:45.374 --> 57:47.507
my poor father
suffered a heart attack.

57:48.073 --> 57:50.205
And my mother abandoned me
to reinvent herself

57:50.249 --> 57:53.295
in Palm Springs.
And after all that,

57:53.339 --> 57:55.080
I knew someday,

57:56.211 --> 57:58.866
I would get revenge
on that small town.

57:59.476 --> 58:02.130
And everyone
that chose to live in it.

58:03.305 --> 58:08.441
That dreadful town
that ruined my life

58:09.703 --> 58:13.141
and cost me everything.

58:15.230 --> 58:17.929
I think your feelings are valid
and this is the only answer.

58:17.972 --> 58:19.060
Thank you, Yoyo.

58:19.365 --> 58:21.323
But we have to get another
microchip to Edgar.

58:21.367 --> 58:22.629
We're running out of time.

58:22.673 --> 58:24.631
Oh, don't worry about that.

58:25.458 --> 58:28.548
Plan B is in already in motion.

58:44.869 --> 58:46.348
Here you go.
-Thank you.

58:46.392 --> 58:48.481
It's me. We spoke on the phone.

58:49.613 --> 58:50.701
Darlie Bunkle?

58:50.744 --> 58:52.964
Shoot!
I forgot you knew my name.

58:53.007 --> 58:55.575
Yeah, it's me, Darlie Bunkle.
205 Pagoda Drive.

58:56.315 --> 58:57.577
Is that your address?

58:57.621 --> 59:00.101
Damn it!
That was private.

59:00.145 --> 59:02.321
So, any idea when you think
the microchip will be ready?

59:02.364 --> 59:04.932
-It's ready. I have a plan.
- Good.

59:05.367 --> 59:07.369
A piece of paper
will be slipped under your door

59:07.413 --> 59:09.937
naming the time and the place
for the drop off.

59:09.981 --> 59:12.853
It will lined notebook paper
with frayed edges.

59:12.897 --> 59:15.552
Letters will be small
because the message is private.

59:16.640 --> 59:19.120
Why don't you
just tell it to me now

59:19.164 --> 59:21.383
instead of having
to come back here later on?

59:26.563 --> 59:29.348
Listen, Edgar, I've been
thinking about your idea.

59:30.001 --> 59:32.046
You know, the one where I just
tell you where we're meeting

59:32.481 --> 59:34.396
instead of me driving
a piece of paper to you

59:34.440 --> 59:35.484
-wherever you are later.
-Yeah.

59:35.746 --> 59:37.965
And I like it. I like it.

59:39.227 --> 59:41.186
I'll meet you outside
your hotel room

59:41.229 --> 59:42.753
probably at sundown.

59:42.796 --> 59:44.668
When you see me next,
I'll be wearing a large

59:45.146 --> 59:47.932
purple Zorro-style fedora
and the rest I don't know yet

59:47.975 --> 59:50.630
but I love colors, all of them.

59:50.674 --> 59:52.197
All right. I mean,
you're the expert. Okay.

59:52.240 --> 59:55.156
Thank you. I am. Yeah,
I'm gonna sneak out subtly,

59:55.200 --> 59:56.636
show you how it's done.

1:00:04.557 --> 1:00:05.732
Damn it!

1:00:07.604 --> 1:00:09.736
Bard, look. A banana boat.

1:00:09.780 --> 1:00:11.433
I can't wait for us
to go on that together.

1:00:11.477 --> 1:00:12.609
Yeah.

1:00:12.652 --> 1:00:14.741
Ladies, I know
I've said this a lot,

1:00:14.785 --> 1:00:16.308
but it's really hard
to draw your faces

1:00:16.351 --> 1:00:17.396
when you keep talking.

1:00:17.962 --> 1:00:19.703
-Sorry. Enough said. Yes.
-I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

1:00:19.746 --> 1:00:22.575
Apologize.
What is she drawing?

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:23.924
-I don't know.
-You just did it.

1:00:23.968 --> 1:00:25.056
-You moved your head again.
-I'm a caricature.

1:00:25.099 --> 1:00:26.187
The suspense is killing me.

1:00:26.231 --> 1:00:27.319
I hope she
gives me bigger teeth.

1:00:27.362 --> 1:00:28.799
-Love big teeth.
-She loves big teeth.

1:00:28.842 --> 1:00:29.930
-Good to know.
- I just like how

1:00:30.235 --> 1:00:32.846
everything is accentuated
in the caricatures.

1:00:32.890 --> 1:00:35.588
So, feel free to make my teeth
as big as you want.

1:00:35.632 --> 1:00:38.112
Like just real big. Like,
even if it's just two eyes

1:00:38.156 --> 1:00:39.766
and a bunch of teeth,
that would be--

1:00:39.810 --> 1:00:41.681
Barb. Um, uh...

1:00:41.725 --> 1:00:44.249
Gosh! All of a sudden, I'm...
I'm not feeling so good.

1:00:44.728 --> 1:00:46.904
Oh. Oh, no. Are you--
are you okay?

1:00:46.947 --> 1:00:49.123
I don't know. No.
I think I have the flu.

1:00:49.167 --> 1:00:51.473
I think I should go lay down
in the room or something.

1:00:51.517 --> 1:00:53.214
Oh, Star. Do you want me
to come with you?

1:00:53.258 --> 1:00:54.738
No. I don't wanna ruin your day.

1:00:54.781 --> 1:00:55.956
Just, uh, go snorkeling?

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.915
Snorkeling? In the ocean
with the currents?

1:00:57.958 --> 1:00:59.525
-Oh, I couldn't do that.
-Oh.

1:00:59.568 --> 1:01:01.309
Plus, we said we were
gonna do these things together.

1:01:01.570 --> 1:01:03.311
I'll just wait for you
to get better.

1:01:03.355 --> 1:01:05.400
Probably a few hours or so.
I'm feeling very faint.

1:01:05.444 --> 1:01:07.098
But, um, I'll see you--
I'll see you then.

1:01:07.141 --> 1:01:09.491
All right. I'm done.
-Star.

1:01:09.535 --> 1:01:11.450
And there you go. Enjoy.

1:01:12.625 --> 1:01:14.714
I can see where the talking
was problematic.

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.325
Uh-hmm.
That's what your face was doing.

1:01:30.861 --> 1:01:31.818
You want in?

1:01:31.862 --> 1:01:34.168
Oh, no. No, thanks.

1:02:03.589 --> 1:02:06.897
There's a current, everyone!
There's a current!

1:02:07.462 --> 1:02:08.637
Oh, my God. Waves.

1:02:13.860 --> 1:02:16.689
Pineapple princess all day

1:02:16.733 --> 1:02:21.694
On the hill above the bay

1:02:26.655 --> 1:02:30.311
On a crocodile

1:02:34.663 --> 1:02:38.232
Forevermore

1:02:40.539 --> 1:02:43.324
Pineapple princess all day

1:02:43.368 --> 1:02:47.459
On the hill above the bay

1:02:47.807 --> 1:02:50.157
I love you

1:02:50.201 --> 1:02:52.420
I've seen

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:56.773
My pineapple queen

1:03:01.342 --> 1:03:02.474
Oh.

1:03:09.437 --> 1:03:11.135
- Oh, no!

1:03:11.178 --> 1:03:13.833
How are you feeling?
Let me check.

1:03:14.834 --> 1:03:17.532
Oh. Yup. It's fever.
A hundred and thirty-seven.

1:03:17.837 --> 1:03:19.970
-Oh.
-You better rest.

1:03:20.622 --> 1:03:23.147
Look at you. Looks like
you're getting a little tan.

1:03:23.408 --> 1:03:24.801
Oh.

1:03:27.194 --> 1:03:28.805
There's a skylight
in the business center.

1:03:28.848 --> 1:03:29.849
Oh.

1:03:29.893 --> 1:03:31.329
I've been
in the business center.

1:03:31.372 --> 1:03:32.809
-Okay. Well, I better-- Gosh!
-I don't wanna give you

1:03:32.852 --> 1:03:34.245
-what I have.
-I'm gonna let you get you rest.

1:03:34.288 --> 1:03:35.942
-Contagious. I'm so sick.
-Yeah.

1:03:35.986 --> 1:03:37.683
Yeah, I'll check in
with you later.

1:03:37.726 --> 1:03:41.165
From banana trees

1:03:41.208 --> 1:03:45.430
On his water skis

1:03:45.473 --> 1:03:49.826
And beneath the blue

1:03:49.869 --> 1:03:53.307
His ukulele too

1:03:53.917 --> 1:03:56.397
I love you

1:03:56.441 --> 1:03:58.835
I've seen

1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:02.882
My pineapple queen

1:04:02.926 --> 1:04:06.146
Woo!
This is living!

1:04:07.191 --> 1:04:08.235
Woo!

1:04:13.153 --> 1:04:15.286
Mm.

1:04:17.070 --> 1:04:18.376
These just arrived.

1:04:23.990 --> 1:04:27.951
Well, looks like Edgar
is distracting himself.

1:04:28.777 --> 1:04:29.778
Hmm.

1:04:31.563 --> 1:04:33.478
Well, she is beautiful.

1:04:34.392 --> 1:04:36.307
You want me
to take care of them?

1:04:37.134 --> 1:04:40.485
No, Yoyo.
I'll handle this.

1:04:50.103 --> 1:04:52.714
Ow! Oh, my-- Ow!

1:04:53.715 --> 1:04:56.501
-Here!
-Oh, my.

1:04:56.544 --> 1:04:57.850
Take my calloused hand.

1:05:00.244 --> 1:05:02.594
Oh.
That's very calloused.

1:05:02.637 --> 1:05:04.944
Wow! Feels like barnacles.

1:05:04.988 --> 1:05:07.120
Oh, yeah. I fell on my elbow.

1:05:07.164 --> 1:05:09.122
It's all right.
It'll be fine.

1:05:09.166 --> 1:05:12.299
What is such a beautiful woman
doing all alone out here?

1:05:13.126 --> 1:05:14.432
in the sticks?

1:05:15.041 --> 1:05:18.088
Oh. I'm just changing
into my regular clothes.

1:05:18.131 --> 1:05:20.568
I-- I'm sorry.
I thought it was private here.

1:05:20.612 --> 1:05:21.743
Give me your arm.

1:05:21.787 --> 1:05:23.049
-What?
- Your arm.

1:05:23.093 --> 1:05:23.963
Oh.

1:05:25.747 --> 1:05:26.748
Thank you.

1:05:27.924 --> 1:05:29.751
What do you mean
regular clothes?

1:05:29.795 --> 1:05:31.492
It's a long story.
I'm on vacation,

1:05:31.536 --> 1:05:33.059
and my friend is sick,

1:05:33.103 --> 1:05:34.974
and I've been pretending
that I'm doing nothing,

1:05:35.018 --> 1:05:36.889
but I've been doing everything.

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:38.238
Anyway, I feel bad.

1:05:38.543 --> 1:05:40.937
But I have to admit, I also
have never felt more alive.

1:05:40.980 --> 1:05:42.112
Am I a bad friend?

1:05:42.677 --> 1:05:43.983
You could only be a friend

1:05:44.027 --> 1:05:45.942
if you're a friend
to yourself first.

1:05:45.985 --> 1:05:47.682
That is where you find
your truth.

1:05:47.987 --> 1:05:49.554
What if I don't know my truth?

1:05:49.597 --> 1:05:51.730
What if you do?
-Oh.

1:05:51.773 --> 1:05:53.950
You are finding
your courage, your voice.

1:05:54.733 --> 1:05:56.996
-You're being delivered.
-I am?

1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:59.085
It is time to mount the wind
and ride it

1:05:59.129 --> 1:06:02.045
with the fierceness
of a hippopotamus.

1:06:03.437 --> 1:06:04.438
Okay.

1:06:05.091 --> 1:06:06.440
-Ha-hoya!
-Oh.

1:06:07.789 --> 1:06:10.531
-You are rising.
- Oh, my God.

1:06:10.575 --> 1:06:14.013
Your truth is
that you are a phoenix.

1:06:15.406 --> 1:06:17.408
Dumbledore's bird.

1:06:18.061 --> 1:06:20.628
Who?
-Dumbledore.

1:06:21.368 --> 1:06:24.981
I must leave now...
to finish my swamp walk.

1:06:26.243 --> 1:06:29.986
Remember, your shimmer
is on the horizon.

1:06:31.900 --> 1:06:34.512
My shimmer?
How did you know that?

1:06:35.208 --> 1:06:36.470
It's what I do.

1:06:38.255 --> 1:06:40.866
Wait. Sir, I'm sorry,
what was your name.

1:06:41.736 --> 1:06:42.999
The name is Tommy.

1:06:44.522 --> 1:06:45.697
Tommy Bahama.

1:06:53.661 --> 1:06:55.054
What the fu...

1:06:55.098 --> 1:06:56.708
-Bless you.

1:06:56.751 --> 1:06:57.883
Thank you.

1:06:59.363 --> 1:07:02.627
Edgar, what are we gonna do
when this trip is over?

1:07:02.670 --> 1:07:04.585
Let's not talk about the future.

1:07:04.629 --> 1:07:06.326
I just wanna spend
every moment we have

1:07:06.370 --> 1:07:09.199
discovering different levels
of specialness in you.

1:07:09.242 --> 1:07:11.288
Oh, you're so amazing.

1:07:11.331 --> 1:07:13.507
I have so many feelings
in my heart.

1:07:13.551 --> 1:07:15.031
Just incredible and amazing.

1:07:15.074 --> 1:07:16.423
I have those feelings too.

1:07:22.647 --> 1:07:24.736
You've been pleasuring me
a lot lately.

1:07:24.779 --> 1:07:27.217
In that last position,
your dong went really deep.

1:07:28.218 --> 1:07:30.611
I think your dong
went all the way up and...

1:07:32.048 --> 1:07:33.310
touched my heart.

1:07:34.485 --> 1:07:35.790
So, what do we do now?

1:07:35.834 --> 1:07:37.314
I mean, do you still just want

1:07:37.357 --> 1:07:39.490
meaningless flings
or something more...

1:07:39.533 --> 1:07:40.404
Official?

1:07:42.014 --> 1:07:43.015
What?

1:07:44.364 --> 1:07:45.583
Oh, Star!

1:07:54.244 --> 1:07:57.290
Oh, I have to go. I have...
I have a business meeting.

1:07:57.334 --> 1:07:59.118
Oh, business meeting.

1:07:59.162 --> 1:08:01.816
Oh, no. I wish I could tell you
more about my job,

1:08:01.860 --> 1:08:03.253
-but--
-No. No. Come on.

1:08:03.296 --> 1:08:05.907
What else is there to know?
You're a clam inspector,

1:08:05.951 --> 1:08:07.561
and you're in town
on top business.

1:08:14.655 --> 1:08:15.961
Okay.

1:08:27.277 --> 1:08:30.106
Gosh, he smells so good.

1:08:31.716 --> 1:08:32.847
Is this right?

1:08:33.587 --> 1:08:35.633
What about Barb?

1:08:37.939 --> 1:08:39.811
I'm in a big pickle,
little crab.

1:08:41.769 --> 1:08:43.075
What am I gonna do?

1:08:44.859 --> 1:08:48.515
Go with your heart.
Love is rare.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:50.822
True friends forgive.

1:08:51.953 --> 1:08:54.304
Oh. Well, that makes me
feel better.

1:08:54.347 --> 1:08:56.001
-I--
-To a point.

1:08:56.044 --> 1:08:59.570
Well, it depends what you do
and how long your lie lasts.

1:08:59.918 --> 1:09:02.007
Now, if you really
"F" her over,

1:09:02.050 --> 1:09:04.357
she is not gonna talk
to you again.

1:09:04.705 --> 1:09:08.187
Oh. Well, thanks a lot.

1:09:09.623 --> 1:09:11.930
Shoot!
I should probably get going.

1:09:11.973 --> 1:09:12.974
The name's Morgan.

1:09:13.453 --> 1:09:15.934
Morgan Freemond, with a "D."

1:09:16.630 --> 1:09:18.980
Okay.
Well, maybe I'll see you around.

1:09:19.024 --> 1:09:21.287
You won't.

1:09:21.940 --> 1:09:24.769
I am going
into the ocean tonight

1:09:24.812 --> 1:09:26.771
and I shall never return.

1:09:27.511 --> 1:09:29.991
Oh, I have lived a full life.

1:09:30.035 --> 1:09:33.865
Bathed in the sun.
Slept in the sand.

1:09:33.908 --> 1:09:37.912
I was in jail.
Even drove an old lady around,

1:09:37.956 --> 1:09:41.220
and taught her about tolerance
and true friendship.

1:09:41.264 --> 1:09:43.570
But that kid is long gone.

1:09:44.180 --> 1:09:47.139
This old crab
is all that's left.

1:09:50.055 --> 1:09:52.492
Goodbye, me.

1:10:03.938 --> 1:10:06.289
Psst! Get me tonight.
I'm having a yard sale.

1:10:06.332 --> 1:10:07.986
And it's going better
than I thought.

1:10:08.029 --> 1:10:11.555
So, the microchip is inside.
Keep it private.

1:10:11.598 --> 1:10:14.906
Darlie Bunkle. Age, 41.
Weight, 179. Damn it!

1:10:18.736 --> 1:10:20.477
Oh, my gosh.

1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:22.218
I love this place.

1:10:22.261 --> 1:10:23.958
I love this bar.
I love the food.

1:10:24.002 --> 1:10:27.614
I love the way Richard's music
always lift my spirits. Oh!

1:10:27.658 --> 1:10:29.834
From high school

1:10:33.577 --> 1:10:36.232
All dead...

1:10:37.450 --> 1:10:39.974
That one's a little dark,
but I love it here.

1:10:40.018 --> 1:10:41.280
We love having you, Barb.

1:10:41.324 --> 1:10:42.847
Aw, that's so sweet.

1:10:42.890 --> 1:10:43.935
Hey, Barb.

1:10:43.978 --> 1:10:45.676
-Jeff.
-Ready for the banana boat?

1:10:45.719 --> 1:10:47.025
-Oh, yes.
-All right.

1:10:47.068 --> 1:10:48.461
Gosh! I forgot
we were doing this.

1:10:48.505 --> 1:10:49.897
-Put this on.
-Is it okay

1:10:49.941 --> 1:10:51.638
if I just wear my culottes?
I forgot.

1:10:51.682 --> 1:10:53.161
-Yeah.
-Great.

1:10:53.205 --> 1:10:54.772
Just helping you ready
'cause you're in

1:10:54.815 --> 1:10:56.034
for a real tit flapper.

1:10:56.077 --> 1:10:57.818
Jeff, really?

1:10:57.862 --> 1:10:59.298
It's what it does.

1:10:59.342 --> 1:11:01.300
Your skin jiggles,
your tits start flapping.

1:11:01.344 --> 1:11:04.260
-Anyway, after you.
-Oh, okay.

1:11:04.303 --> 1:11:05.696
Oh, I'm so excited.

1:11:05.739 --> 1:11:07.306
I'm, you know,
feeling a little guilty.

1:11:07.350 --> 1:11:09.656
I supposed to be doing this
with Star.

1:11:10.527 --> 1:11:11.484
You know what?

1:11:11.789 --> 1:11:14.052
I'm gonna wait
till she's feeling better,

1:11:14.095 --> 1:11:15.488
'cause this the one thing

1:11:15.532 --> 1:11:18.448
that we really, really,
really wanted to do together.

1:11:21.102 --> 1:11:21.973
Star?

1:11:25.672 --> 1:11:26.804
Ya-ya-yow!

1:11:29.807 --> 1:11:30.895
That's hot.

1:11:36.204 --> 1:11:37.902
Look, Star, I...

1:11:39.033 --> 1:11:40.121
I really like you.

1:11:40.165 --> 1:11:42.602
Oh, my God.
Yes, I will.

1:11:43.473 --> 1:11:44.865
-What?
-Hmm?

1:11:45.910 --> 1:11:49.870
Oh. Oh. Nothing. Never mind.
I thought you were-- It wasn't.

1:11:50.262 --> 1:11:52.699
It's not. It's okay.
Never mind.

1:11:52.743 --> 1:11:55.136
-My head is just a little...
-

1:11:57.748 --> 1:11:58.879
That's my cell phone.

1:11:58.923 --> 1:12:00.664
-Oh. Phew!
-Yeah.

1:12:02.230 --> 1:12:05.233
It's work.
I should probably take this.

1:12:05.277 --> 1:12:06.278
Okay.

1:12:06.670 --> 1:12:07.758
See each other soon?

1:12:08.193 --> 1:12:09.281
-Okay.
-Star.

1:12:09.325 --> 1:12:10.761
Yeah?

1:12:10.804 --> 1:12:12.110
I've never been this happy.

1:12:12.458 --> 1:12:13.459
Really?

1:12:14.242 --> 1:12:15.243
Oh.

1:12:15.679 --> 1:12:17.245
Musical.
-What?

1:12:17.637 --> 1:12:22.338
Uh-uh. I've gonna be...

1:12:22.381 --> 1:12:23.948
-I didn't get it.
-

1:12:23.991 --> 1:12:25.950
I'm gonna be-- Yeah.

1:12:26.690 --> 1:12:29.475
Okay.

1:12:30.128 --> 1:12:31.303
Hmm?

1:12:39.746 --> 1:12:41.661
-

1:12:44.882 --> 1:12:45.883
Star.

1:12:48.015 --> 1:12:50.670
Well, I don't know
how much clearer I can be.

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:55.632
I've changed my mind.

1:12:55.675 --> 1:12:57.155
I see now, you've been using me.

1:12:57.198 --> 1:12:59.462
Edgar, don't be silly.

1:12:59.505 --> 1:13:00.898
We're almost at
the finish line.

1:13:00.941 --> 1:13:04.075
And you and I can be official.

1:13:04.336 --> 1:13:05.598
Don't even try.

1:13:05.642 --> 1:13:07.600
You know,
I've figured it all out.

1:13:07.644 --> 1:13:09.602
You pretended to loved me.

1:13:09.646 --> 1:13:11.169
You made me a bunch of promises

1:13:11.212 --> 1:13:12.562
so that I would come down here

1:13:12.605 --> 1:13:14.564
and place the receiver
on the stage,

1:13:14.607 --> 1:13:16.522
in the middle
of the Seafood Jam party,

1:13:16.566 --> 1:13:18.437
that will attract
thousands of deadly mosquitoes

1:13:18.481 --> 1:13:20.439
that are gonna kill
thousands of people.

1:13:20.483 --> 1:13:22.049
Excuse me.

1:13:22.093 --> 1:13:25.618
Did you get that leaf and pearl
necklace down by the boardwalk?

1:13:25.662 --> 1:13:29.230
Oh, yes.
I got it at Baleafy Ornate.

1:13:29.274 --> 1:13:30.580
I'm sorry. What?

1:13:30.623 --> 1:13:33.017
-Baleafy Ornate.
-What?

1:13:33.060 --> 1:13:35.454
And not that you care,
but I have met someone.

1:13:35.498 --> 1:13:38.544
And unlike you, I know-- I know
what real love feels like,

1:13:38.588 --> 1:13:40.677
and it is not
how you've treated me.

1:13:41.417 --> 1:13:44.898
-It feels amazing and special.
- Oh, Edgar,

1:13:44.942 --> 1:13:47.248
I really hate to be the one
to tell you this.

1:13:47.292 --> 1:13:48.815
You know, you-- your girlfriend

1:13:48.859 --> 1:13:51.209
and her little partner,
the ones with the fluffy hair

1:13:51.252 --> 1:13:53.864
-and the culottes.
-How do you know about them?

1:13:53.907 --> 1:13:57.476
Their spies, Edgar. They're not
who they say they are

1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:59.435
and they've been playing you
all along.

1:14:00.610 --> 1:14:02.481
-You're lying.
- I wish I was.

1:14:02.525 --> 1:14:03.439
Luckily,

1:14:03.787 --> 1:14:06.224
I have some inside sources
at their agency.

1:14:06.267 --> 1:14:07.747
What agency?
Who do they work for?

1:14:08.052 --> 1:14:12.404
-The H...P... V.

1:14:13.623 --> 1:14:15.625
-Sounds familiar.
- Check your emails.

1:14:15.668 --> 1:14:17.975
We've intercepted some
of the photos they've sent back

1:14:18.018 --> 1:14:19.585
to headquarters.
I think you'll find

1:14:19.629 --> 1:14:21.544
there are some interesting ones.

1:14:24.503 --> 1:14:27.027
It all looks very fun.

1:14:27.071 --> 1:14:29.203
-Star, no.
-Oh,

1:14:29.247 --> 1:14:30.422
I know, Edgar,

1:14:30.770 --> 1:14:33.643
this must hurt that she
lied to you about loving you.

1:14:34.121 --> 1:14:35.514
And I don't blame you

1:14:35.558 --> 1:14:37.429
about running into the arms
of another woman.

1:14:37.473 --> 1:14:39.649
I hadn't been there for you,
and I'm so sorry.

1:14:39.692 --> 1:14:43.696
Let's get away after this,
find a little place in Portugal

1:14:43.740 --> 1:14:45.742
where we can be official.

1:14:45.785 --> 1:14:48.571
I got the necklace
at Baleafy Ornate.

1:14:48.614 --> 1:14:51.138
-I cannot hear you. What?
-Baleafy Ornate.

1:14:51.182 --> 1:14:52.139
It's called Baleafy Ornate!

1:14:52.575 --> 1:14:54.402
It sells everything bay leaf!

1:14:54.446 --> 1:14:57.275
It's a play on words!
My God, lady!

1:14:57.318 --> 1:14:58.319
Okay.

1:15:00.321 --> 1:15:01.627
-Oh.
-

1:15:04.717 --> 1:15:05.892
Sorry I yelled.

1:15:06.414 --> 1:15:07.285
-Sorry.
-Shit!

1:15:07.764 --> 1:15:08.852
What shit?

1:15:09.156 --> 1:15:10.984
It was Barb, the other one.
She was listening

1:15:11.028 --> 1:15:12.725
at the door.
Damn, they're good...

1:15:12.769 --> 1:15:14.901
spies.
I can't believe this.

1:15:15.423 --> 1:15:18.601
Edgar, you listen to me
and you listen to me good.

1:15:27.392 --> 1:15:29.263
-Edgar?
-I'm listening.

1:15:29.307 --> 1:15:31.222
Okay. I just wanted to make
sure you could still hear me.

1:15:31.265 --> 1:15:33.093
Sometimes
the connection in here...

1:15:33.137 --> 1:15:34.051
Anyway,

1:15:34.442 --> 1:15:37.968
I need you to find those two.
And kill them.

1:15:41.406 --> 1:15:42.407
Star.

1:15:43.756 --> 1:15:44.757
Star!

1:15:47.934 --> 1:15:50.110
Oh, don't bother
pretending to be sick anymore.

1:15:50.154 --> 1:15:51.938
I know all
about your little lies.

1:15:51.982 --> 1:15:54.027
And I know all
about you and Edgar.

1:15:54.071 --> 1:15:56.116
And guess what?
He's a bad man!

1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:57.465
And he's gonna do
something terrible!

1:15:57.857 --> 1:15:59.076
-What?
-He's following orders

1:15:59.511 --> 1:16:00.817
from someone. I overheard him
on the phone with his boss.

1:16:00.860 --> 1:16:01.818
His boss from Clamco?

1:16:02.122 --> 1:16:04.342
No, Star! He lied to you!
He's a killer!

1:16:04.385 --> 1:16:05.430
A killer?

1:16:06.213 --> 1:16:09.652
But, Barb, what you're saying
is ridiculous.

1:16:09.695 --> 1:16:11.523
There's nothing ridiculous
about what I'm saying.

1:16:11.567 --> 1:16:13.438
Edgar put a receiver
in the middle of the Seafood Jam

1:16:13.481 --> 1:16:15.614
that'll trigger deadly mosquitos
that'll fly into the crowd

1:16:15.658 --> 1:16:17.616
and sting everybody
with their killer tails!

1:16:18.530 --> 1:16:20.924
Why are you doing this?

1:16:22.882 --> 1:16:25.189
-You're making this all up!
-Oh, come on.

1:16:25.232 --> 1:16:26.364
I cannot believe you.

1:16:26.407 --> 1:16:29.149
You're mad
because Edgar picked me!

1:16:29.193 --> 1:16:31.282
Get me a break.
I am not mad about that.

1:16:31.325 --> 1:16:33.153
And I am not making it up.

1:16:33.806 --> 1:16:35.939
-I'm calling the police.
- Fine.

1:16:37.984 --> 1:16:39.725
Jeff's Banana Boats?

1:16:40.639 --> 1:16:41.814
I didn't go through with it.

1:16:41.858 --> 1:16:43.686
While I was lying here
in my deathbed?

1:16:43.729 --> 1:16:45.339
-You weren't sick.
-You didn't know that?

1:16:45.383 --> 1:16:47.472
-Because you lied.
-So did you.

1:16:51.345 --> 1:16:52.956
I should have gone
on that banana boat.

1:16:52.999 --> 1:16:54.566
-I wish I did.
-Oh.

1:16:54.610 --> 1:16:57.700
I hear it's a real
tit flapper.

1:17:01.268 --> 1:17:02.922
911, what's your emergency?

1:17:02.966 --> 1:17:04.315
Uh, never mind.

1:17:04.358 --> 1:17:08.885
I thought I saw a burglar
but it was a... turtle.

1:17:21.724 --> 1:17:23.377
Yoyo, where are you?

1:17:23.421 --> 1:17:24.988
The mosquitoes are almost there.

1:17:25.423 --> 1:17:26.337
Goodie.

1:17:27.033 --> 1:17:29.819
And, remember, don't keep
the steering wheel too straight.

1:17:29.862 --> 1:17:32.256
Lots of tiny movements,
left to right.

1:17:34.954 --> 1:17:37.087
I wish we wouldn't
have had these ropes.

1:17:37.130 --> 1:17:38.784
-Stop squirming.

1:17:39.350 --> 1:17:41.831
Believe me this is better.
I'm supposed to kill you guys.

1:17:41.874 --> 1:17:44.660
What? Who said to kill us?
Edgar, what is happening?

1:17:44.703 --> 1:17:47.358
-Ow! Our bracelets are sharp.
-These bracelets really hurt.

1:17:47.401 --> 1:17:49.403
-They're sharp. I know.
-They're sharp, be careful

1:17:51.710 --> 1:17:54.278
Edgar, you lied to me!

1:17:54.321 --> 1:17:57.368
You should talk.
I know all about the HPV.

1:17:58.761 --> 1:18:00.545
Okay. Look, I was gonna
tell you about that.

1:18:00.588 --> 1:18:03.026
A lot of people have it.
I mean, you probably have it.

1:18:03.069 --> 1:18:05.332
What?
Stop trying to confuse me.

1:18:06.029 --> 1:18:08.466
Star, I thought
you we're different.

1:18:08.509 --> 1:18:09.728
Edgar.

1:18:09.772 --> 1:18:11.295
Don't let him
bamboozled you, Star.

1:18:11.338 --> 1:18:12.949
He's a murderer.
Tell her.

1:18:12.992 --> 1:18:15.734
-You're not who you say you are.
-You're not who you say you are.

1:18:15.778 --> 1:18:18.345
We are who we are.
We're Barb and Star.

1:18:18.389 --> 1:18:21.479
Unlike you, Edgar,
you big effin' liar.

1:18:21.522 --> 1:18:22.523
Huh?

1:18:22.567 --> 1:18:24.395
God, I knew this wasn't real.

1:18:24.438 --> 1:18:26.397
And no one could ever
love me again.

1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:28.573
God, I'm in so much grief
right now.

1:18:28.616 --> 1:18:31.271
-Goodbye, ladies.
- Edgar, please wait.

1:18:31.315 --> 1:18:32.969
A lot of innocent people
will die.

1:18:33.012 --> 1:18:34.753
At least tell us why?

1:18:34.797 --> 1:18:37.451
Why you would ever be involved
with such an awful thing?

1:18:40.759 --> 1:18:44.154
Fine.
I'll tell you.

1:18:46.460 --> 1:18:49.942
-Oh, he pulled up a chair.
-It's gonna be a long story.

1:18:49.986 --> 1:18:52.118
When I was seven years old
my father

1:18:52.162 --> 1:18:53.859
left my mom,
my eleven sisters, and me.

1:18:53.903 --> 1:18:56.296
Use your bracelet.
- I was the oldest,

1:18:56.340 --> 1:18:57.820
so I had to support us.

1:18:58.821 --> 1:19:00.213
We had no money.

1:19:01.519 --> 1:19:04.348
I did odd jobs.
I built lawnmowers for Honda.

1:19:04.391 --> 1:19:06.219
I even tried to sell my poop
to farmers

1:19:06.263 --> 1:19:08.004
saying that it was fertilizer.

1:19:09.179 --> 1:19:10.571
It was never enough.

1:19:11.181 --> 1:19:13.618
One day,
a woman wearing a cape

1:19:13.661 --> 1:19:16.752
and bag over her head
put $50 in my cup.

1:19:18.492 --> 1:19:20.407
-Oh. Hmm.
-Oh. Mm-hmm.

1:19:22.670 --> 1:19:23.846
She started to seduce me

1:19:23.889 --> 1:19:25.456
as the errands
became more criminal.

1:19:25.499 --> 1:19:27.458
-I fell under her spell.

1:19:28.111 --> 1:19:29.460
I thought it was love.

1:19:32.332 --> 1:19:33.943
I would do anything for her.

1:19:33.986 --> 1:19:36.249
We'd always talk
about this particular plan.

1:19:36.293 --> 1:19:37.424
Her life's work.

1:19:38.295 --> 1:19:39.818
When it came time to help her,
I said, Yes.

1:19:40.166 --> 1:19:41.777
Of course,
I had my reservations,

1:19:41.820 --> 1:19:42.821
but...

1:19:43.866 --> 1:19:47.391
But she said when it was over,
we could be an official couple.

1:19:47.434 --> 1:19:50.481
That's all I wanted at the time.
That's all I've ever wanted.

1:19:51.699 --> 1:19:53.310
People do crazy things for love.

1:19:54.398 --> 1:19:56.530
Yeah, but, I mean,
killing people, that's...

1:19:56.574 --> 1:19:57.793
that's a lot.

1:19:58.228 --> 1:20:00.839
Yeah, it's a lot of people.
That's... that's a little crazy.

1:20:00.883 --> 1:20:03.320
Is it? Wouldn't you
have done it for Carmine?

1:20:05.322 --> 1:20:06.627
And you for Ron?

1:20:09.021 --> 1:20:10.588
Wait.

1:20:10.631 --> 1:20:12.851
How do you know about Barb's
dead husband, Ron Quicksilver?

1:20:12.895 --> 1:20:14.592
-Wait.
-She told me

1:20:14.635 --> 1:20:16.072
-when she came to see me.
-Oh.

1:20:16.115 --> 1:20:17.900
That night on the foot bridge
right before you did.

1:20:17.943 --> 1:20:20.076
Well, you weren't supposed
to say that.

1:20:20.598 --> 1:20:23.601
Goodbye, Barb and Star.
Whoever you are.

1:20:27.039 --> 1:20:30.086
Okay. We can talk about it.
Let's just talk about it.

1:20:30.129 --> 1:20:32.436
It's-- It was a long time ago.
A long time.

1:20:33.132 --> 1:20:35.134
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

1:20:35.178 --> 1:20:37.920
to the 49th Annual Seafood Jam,

1:20:38.616 --> 1:20:40.270
where the clams are hot

1:20:40.313 --> 1:20:42.881
and the crowd
is on the older side.

1:20:46.102 --> 1:20:47.407
People are gonna die!

1:20:47.451 --> 1:20:49.061
-We have to find Edgar!
-You're right,

1:20:49.105 --> 1:20:51.368
but by me agreeing with you
about having to stop Edgar,

1:20:51.411 --> 1:20:53.239
I don't agree about
stopping being mad at you.

1:20:53.283 --> 1:20:55.198
We agree to go.
But I want you to know

1:20:55.241 --> 1:20:56.895
that I'm frustrated and hurt

1:20:56.939 --> 1:20:58.549
and I'm really
freaking pissed off.

1:20:58.592 --> 1:21:00.856
I'm freaking pissed off too.
It's not that I'm copying you

1:21:00.899 --> 1:21:01.987
-It's because I am.
-Fine.

1:21:06.470 --> 1:21:07.688
Hello.

1:21:07.732 --> 1:21:08.776
Hi.

1:21:26.794 --> 1:21:28.927
Oh, hello.
-

1:21:29.406 --> 1:21:31.321
Enjoying your vacation?

1:21:32.496 --> 1:21:33.932
-Well, um...
-Oh, um...

1:21:33.976 --> 1:21:36.326
-It started out fine.
-...supposed to be a friend trip

1:21:36.369 --> 1:21:37.980
-We got here and we were...
-And we got here.

1:21:38.023 --> 1:21:39.546
-No, I didn't--
-

1:21:39.590 --> 1:21:41.940
The first night, we went out
to loosen up a little bit.

1:21:41.984 --> 1:21:44.595
That's when we meet Edgar,
which was not a good idea.

1:21:44.638 --> 1:21:47.076
Edgar and I started hanging out,
and I was lying to Barb,

1:21:47.119 --> 1:21:49.034
-which I shouldn't have done...
-I met Tommy Bahama.

1:21:49.078 --> 1:21:50.993
-You met Tommy Bahama? Anyway...
-Then we discovered--

1:21:51.036 --> 1:21:52.081
Enough!

1:21:52.516 --> 1:21:56.302
I have set up one last excursion
for the two of you.

1:21:56.346 --> 1:21:58.652
It's more of a game, really.

1:21:58.696 --> 1:22:04.006
The rules are
you get to choose how you die.

1:22:04.049 --> 1:22:05.181
-What?
-What?

1:22:05.616 --> 1:22:07.400
You can either
jump off that cliff behind you

1:22:07.444 --> 1:22:09.707
hitting every sharp rock
on the way down,

1:22:09.750 --> 1:22:11.535
ripping your skin
at every bounce

1:22:11.578 --> 1:22:14.581
or you can stay here
and have dinner

1:22:15.452 --> 1:22:18.846
with, um... my new friends.

1:22:18.890 --> 1:22:20.370
-There are two

1:22:20.674 --> 1:22:24.330
very hungry hot alligators
in those crates.

1:22:24.374 --> 1:22:25.592
Alligators?

1:22:25.636 --> 1:22:27.159
-Oh, please. No, no...
-No, no, no...

1:22:27.203 --> 1:22:30.641
That's what you get
for getting in my way.

1:22:31.685 --> 1:22:36.125
Now, you can kiss your
middle-aged, flat, wide asses...

1:22:39.519 --> 1:22:40.694
...goodbye.

1:22:40.738 --> 1:22:41.869
-Please wait!
-Oh, my gosh!

1:22:42.131 --> 1:22:44.046
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:22:46.744 --> 1:22:48.964
Thanks a lot, Star, for making
me come on this trip.

1:22:49.007 --> 1:22:50.704
Now, we're gonna die
just like I predicted.

1:22:50.748 --> 1:22:52.706
Oh, will you just stop
your complaining for once?

1:22:52.750 --> 1:22:54.056
Seems to me like you've been
having the time

1:22:54.099 --> 1:22:55.927
-of your life here.
-Oh, I sure have.

1:22:55.971 --> 1:22:58.886
-

1:23:10.594 --> 1:23:12.726
When we get to heaven, we're not
living with each other,

1:23:12.770 --> 1:23:14.511
and we're not running around
playing harps

1:23:14.554 --> 1:23:15.512
in our halos and wings!

1:23:16.165 --> 1:23:18.471
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not even
gonna look for you up there!

1:23:18.515 --> 1:23:20.517
I'm gonna find the farthest
cloud away from you.

1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:22.214
And I'm gonna find Betsy Ross!

1:23:22.258 --> 1:23:24.129
And I'm gonna be
best friends with her.

1:23:24.173 --> 1:23:26.349
And we're gonna ignore you
at all the parties.

1:23:31.136 --> 1:23:33.138
I guess we're gonna die
on bad terms.

1:23:33.182 --> 1:23:34.487
I guess you're right.

1:23:54.377 --> 1:23:56.553
-Our culottes!
-They're natural parachutes.

1:24:13.613 --> 1:24:15.267
I'm so sorry. Oh!

1:24:15.311 --> 1:24:17.226
So sorry. Lying to you
was the hardest thing

1:24:17.269 --> 1:24:18.444
I've ever had to do.

1:24:18.488 --> 1:24:20.229
-I'm sorry too.
-No. This is all my fault.

1:24:20.272 --> 1:24:21.926
None of this will be happening
if I hadn't suggested

1:24:21.969 --> 1:24:23.580
coming on this trip
in the first place.

1:24:23.623 --> 1:24:25.973
Are you kidding? I've had
the time of my life here.

1:24:26.017 --> 1:24:27.714
I've done things
I never thought I would do.

1:24:27.758 --> 1:24:29.716
-I went in the ocean, Star.
-

1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:31.936
-And I got my labia pierced.
-What?

1:24:31.979 --> 1:24:34.112
I took it out.
Immediately took it out.

1:24:34.156 --> 1:24:36.201
I should never have spent
all that time with Edgar

1:24:36.245 --> 1:24:38.073
behind your back.
I should've told you.

1:24:38.116 --> 1:24:40.597
I know you're only
trying to protect my feelings.

1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:42.294
And I'm so happy you found love.

1:24:45.036 --> 1:24:47.473
I mean, it's unfortunate that
he turned out to be a conman

1:24:47.517 --> 1:24:50.128
-and a mass murderer.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1:24:51.347 --> 1:24:52.435
-Oh, my God.
- Edgar.

1:24:52.478 --> 1:24:54.176
We have to stop him.
-Go!

1:24:55.307 --> 1:24:58.223
The Seafood Jam
just keeps on jamming!

1:24:58.832 --> 1:25:00.051
Nice view.

1:25:02.836 --> 1:25:04.360
-What are you doing here?

1:25:05.491 --> 1:25:07.014
Cleaning up your mess.

1:25:07.058 --> 1:25:08.581
Seems like
you can't follow through

1:25:08.625 --> 1:25:10.627
with anything these days.
For example,

1:25:10.670 --> 1:25:12.716
getting rid
of your little friends.

1:25:14.326 --> 1:25:17.503
-I did. I-I mean, I--
-Oh, it's okay, Edgar.

1:25:17.547 --> 1:25:20.115
I took care of them myself.

1:25:20.158 --> 1:25:21.028
What?

1:25:21.638 --> 1:25:23.596
-What did you do?
-Let's just say

1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:25.946
there are a couple
of alligators out there

1:25:25.990 --> 1:25:29.298
with bellies full of... them.

1:25:30.299 --> 1:25:33.345
Oh, don't be so sad, Edgar.

1:25:33.389 --> 1:25:36.566
Those two were just a couple
of pathetic Stellas

1:25:36.609 --> 1:25:38.394
trying to get their groove back.

1:25:39.003 --> 1:25:40.439
But they were spies, right?

1:25:41.397 --> 1:25:43.964
I mean, you told me
that they were spies.

1:25:44.008 --> 1:25:46.532
Sorry. I just said that
to get what I want.

1:25:47.185 --> 1:25:48.665
Sometimes I do that,

1:25:48.708 --> 1:25:52.234
but I'll work on it
on our relationship, I promise.

1:25:52.712 --> 1:25:55.193
That is still what you want,
isn't it, Edgar?

1:25:55.759 --> 1:25:56.803
To be official?

1:25:58.327 --> 1:26:01.939
And, um, the receiver
is in position?

1:26:01.982 --> 1:26:03.767
It's on the stage.

1:26:03.810 --> 1:26:05.943
-The microchip is inside.
-Good.

1:26:11.905 --> 1:26:13.037
This is it.

1:26:13.690 --> 1:26:15.257
My moment of glory.

1:26:16.867 --> 1:26:21.611
Goodbye, Vista Del Mar.
You stupid place

1:26:21.654 --> 1:26:23.003
full of dummies.

1:26:30.663 --> 1:26:32.448
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:26:33.144 --> 1:26:34.450
Shit.

1:26:43.110 --> 1:26:44.590
-Shit.
- Of course, shrimp

1:26:44.634 --> 1:26:47.289
is the most popular fish
in America.

1:26:47.332 --> 1:26:48.855
Let's introduce our finalists.

1:26:49.726 --> 1:26:50.814
Star?

1:26:50.857 --> 1:26:52.294
Sorry.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

1:26:52.337 --> 1:26:54.165
Oh, my God.
Where?

1:26:54.209 --> 1:26:56.036
He said it was on the stage.

1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:58.430
-

1:26:59.301 --> 1:27:01.128
Star.
-Yes?

1:27:01.172 --> 1:27:02.782
Oh, my gosh. That's it.

1:27:03.479 --> 1:27:05.481
Star, it's bleeping.

1:27:05.524 --> 1:27:06.786
Go, go, go, go.

1:27:10.573 --> 1:27:12.488
-We need to get it in the water!
-Okay!

1:27:12.531 --> 1:27:14.098
Run, run!
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.

1:27:14.141 --> 1:27:15.447
-Look, look, look.
- Yeah?

1:27:15.491 --> 1:27:17.928
-Oh, Lord, shells?
- Everything's shells.

1:27:17.971 --> 1:27:20.060
What kind of bird is this?
It's all made out of shells.

1:27:20.104 --> 1:27:22.498
Star!
- He's coming. Run!

1:27:22.541 --> 1:27:23.760
Star. Guys, please stop!

1:27:23.803 --> 1:27:25.544
Please wait!
Hey, I'm trying to stop this!

1:27:25.588 --> 1:27:27.242
No! We won't let you do this.

1:27:27.285 --> 1:27:29.156
We'll throw it on the ocean
and destroy it.

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:30.375
No. That won't destroy it.

1:27:30.419 --> 1:27:31.855
-Just-- just give it to me.
-No.

1:27:31.898 --> 1:27:32.943
Look, I'm sorry.

1:27:33.465 --> 1:27:35.728
She told me you were spies.
That's why I tied you up.

1:27:35.772 --> 1:27:38.775
She's manipulated me
this whole time.

1:27:38.818 --> 1:27:40.603
-Why should we believe you?
-Because...

1:27:42.692 --> 1:27:44.737
-I love you, Star.
-

1:27:45.434 --> 1:27:46.565
Oh.

1:27:46.957 --> 1:27:49.481
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever met,

1:27:50.569 --> 1:27:52.179
especially on the inside.

1:27:53.050 --> 1:27:56.009
Edgar, please.
Not in front of Barb.

1:27:56.053 --> 1:27:58.795
-No. Not that inside.
-Oh.

1:27:58.838 --> 1:28:00.753
-Your heart.
-Oh.

1:28:00.797 --> 1:28:02.973
Listen, I need you guys
to get in the cab

1:28:03.016 --> 1:28:05.018
and drive inland
as fast as you can, okay?

1:28:05.062 --> 1:28:07.020
I'm gonna get in the boat
and dump the receiver

1:28:07.064 --> 1:28:08.370
far out in the ocean, okay?

1:28:08.413 --> 1:28:09.675
You don't have
to worry about me.

1:28:09.719 --> 1:28:11.677
Look, I have the antidote.

1:28:16.378 --> 1:28:17.248
What's the matter?

1:28:18.249 --> 1:28:19.511
Lemon infused ice tea?

1:28:20.817 --> 1:28:23.298
She was setting me up
to die this whole time.

1:28:23.341 --> 1:28:25.648
-Oh. That's not nice.
-Oh. Oh, no.

1:28:26.257 --> 1:28:27.258
It doesn't matter.

1:28:27.867 --> 1:28:30.261
The plan is the same.
I have to go through with it.

1:28:30.305 --> 1:28:32.002
I got us into this mess.
I'm gonna fix it.

1:28:32.045 --> 1:28:33.525
-No, Edgar. No, you can't.
-Star...

1:28:35.266 --> 1:28:36.659
I'm sorry
for getting you into this.

1:28:38.051 --> 1:28:39.444
-Goodbye, Star.
-No.

1:28:39.488 --> 1:28:41.359
You mean hello...
-

1:28:41.403 --> 1:28:42.447
...to me.

1:28:42.969 --> 1:28:43.883
It's me, fools,

1:28:44.406 --> 1:28:47.887
Now, do you recognize me?

1:28:47.931 --> 1:28:49.802
-I was wearing disguise glasses.

1:28:50.281 --> 1:28:51.500
And this disguise shirt,

1:28:51.543 --> 1:28:52.849
-and this disguise--
- Run!

1:28:52.892 --> 1:28:54.938
-

1:28:59.290 --> 1:29:01.945
Hey. Sir. Sir, can we please
borrow your Jet Ski?

1:29:01.988 --> 1:29:03.033
It's really important.

1:29:03.338 --> 1:29:04.904
Don't explain.
I need no further information.

1:29:04.948 --> 1:29:07.603
-Take it. We trust you. Come on.
-I'll drive. Come on.

1:29:07.646 --> 1:29:08.647
Okay.

1:29:09.692 --> 1:29:11.520
Uh, it's beeping faster.

1:29:14.827 --> 1:29:17.047
Okie-dokey.
Time to surface.

1:29:21.443 --> 1:29:23.445
-

1:29:24.010 --> 1:29:25.577
- We're sorry,

1:29:25.621 --> 1:29:28.275
you have reached a number
that's no longer in service.

1:29:28.319 --> 1:29:30.277
-

1:29:30.321 --> 1:29:32.845
-

1:29:55.128 --> 1:29:57.348
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:29:58.915 --> 1:30:01.787
...who will be
this year's

1:30:01.831 --> 1:30:06.792
Seafood Jam Shrimp Queen?

1:30:27.552 --> 1:30:28.945
Releasing the mosquitoes.

1:30:39.303 --> 1:30:41.697
- What's happening?

1:30:41.740 --> 1:30:43.307
We're gonna die this time!

1:30:47.442 --> 1:30:49.313
Okay. My turn.

1:30:50.270 --> 1:30:52.577
My favorite facial expression
goes like this.

1:31:01.325 --> 1:31:03.370
Lord, we're coming
to see you now!

1:31:03.414 --> 1:31:05.721
Open the gate!
- The pearly one!

1:31:05.764 --> 1:31:07.505
Make sure
it's the pearly one!

1:31:08.114 --> 1:31:09.594
And the winner is...

1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:11.378
Sydney Hobart!

1:31:15.252 --> 1:31:19.474
Or is she real?

1:31:20.257 --> 1:31:24.043
For her and the...

1:31:24.566 --> 1:31:27.699
Just stop!
-

1:31:27.743 --> 1:31:29.005
Fine.

1:31:30.572 --> 1:31:33.357
I'll give you your break.
You need it.

1:31:33.400 --> 1:31:36.795
Star. What have I done?
I should be right there.

1:31:40.756 --> 1:31:42.322
Barb,
I gotta get something

1:31:42.366 --> 1:31:44.237
really big off my chest.
The biggest lie of them all.

1:31:44.281 --> 1:31:45.891
-I gotta tell you.
- What?

1:31:46.544 --> 1:31:48.154
I never went
to a turtle's house.

1:31:48.198 --> 1:31:50.113
Oh, Star, that's okay.

1:31:50.156 --> 1:31:52.811
I never splashed and played
with a baby turtle in the tub.

1:31:52.855 --> 1:31:54.770
I never even got in the tub.

1:31:54.813 --> 1:31:56.423
And I still have my
labia pierced.

1:31:56.467 --> 1:31:57.903
-What?
-God, it's so uncomfortable

1:31:57.947 --> 1:32:00.340
sitting on this thing.
I don't think it's healed yet.

1:32:00.384 --> 1:32:01.516
-Barb?
-

1:32:03.126 --> 1:32:04.997
-Barb!
-

1:32:10.873 --> 1:32:13.005
-Give it to me!
-It's too late. It's over.

1:32:19.403 --> 1:32:21.492
Give it to me, or she drowns!

1:32:21.536 --> 1:32:24.539
Star, no!
Star, no!

1:32:27.759 --> 1:32:28.760
Really?

1:32:33.939 --> 1:32:35.158
Eureka!

1:32:43.558 --> 1:32:44.733
Looking for this?

1:32:45.603 --> 1:32:47.083
Yes, I was actually.

1:32:48.388 --> 1:32:50.260
You're really gonna sacrifice
your own lives

1:32:50.303 --> 1:32:52.044
for those fools on the beach?

1:32:52.871 --> 1:32:54.220
Give me the keys!

1:32:55.265 --> 1:32:56.875
-Barb?
-Star?

1:32:57.659 --> 1:32:59.008
No, no, no, no.

1:33:04.448 --> 1:33:07.930
No! No!

1:34:19.088 --> 1:34:20.567
Sorry about that, man.

1:34:21.656 --> 1:34:23.919
Let me know if you wanna get
some food later.

1:34:30.186 --> 1:34:31.709
Barb and Star,

1:34:31.753 --> 1:34:34.756
they... they saved us all.
Now they're gone.

1:34:54.689 --> 1:34:57.648
In your life-lee-low

1:34:57.996 --> 1:35:01.086
Kiss his wife-wee-woe...

1:35:01.130 --> 1:35:02.697
What the fuck?

1:35:04.307 --> 1:35:07.266
About above the water?

1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:11.531
You're alive?

1:35:15.100 --> 1:35:17.189
What just happened?
What was that?

1:35:21.324 --> 1:35:22.717
It was Trish.

1:35:31.421 --> 1:35:33.292
Oh, Star, I'm so sorry

1:35:33.336 --> 1:35:35.904
I was ever involved in such
a horrible plan. I mean,

1:35:36.818 --> 1:35:38.123
I'm so ashamed.

1:35:38.167 --> 1:35:40.560
No, Edgar, I believe you.

1:35:41.474 --> 1:35:44.303
And I do wanna be
an official couple with you.

1:35:45.478 --> 1:35:47.002
Because I love you.

1:35:47.524 --> 1:35:49.744
I love you with all
my fart-- heart.

1:35:49.787 --> 1:35:52.181
Oh, God. What a terrible time
to flub my words.

1:35:53.356 --> 1:35:54.531
-Whoo.
-Yeah.

1:35:54.574 --> 1:35:55.662
-All right.
-Wow!

1:35:55.706 --> 1:35:57.403
- I just wanna say,

1:35:58.056 --> 1:36:01.233
I believe you too, Edgar,
so we're cool.

1:36:01.756 --> 1:36:03.148
Everything's cool.

1:36:03.801 --> 1:36:05.803
I do wonder where we're all
gonna live though?

1:36:05.847 --> 1:36:07.544
Well, isn't this sweet?

1:36:11.156 --> 1:36:13.115
Surprised to see me?

1:36:13.158 --> 1:36:15.987
Well, I'm not surprise.
You took the real antidote?

1:36:16.031 --> 1:36:18.685
Of course, I did!
You traitor!

1:36:18.729 --> 1:36:21.340
And as for you,
I should've push you two

1:36:21.384 --> 1:36:23.212
off the cliff
when I had the chance!

1:36:23.952 --> 1:36:25.867
But it's not too late for me

1:36:25.910 --> 1:36:28.173
to shut your blabbing trap.

1:36:28.217 --> 1:36:30.567
No. You shut your
blabbing trap.

1:36:30.610 --> 1:36:31.655
You're a nobody.

1:36:32.177 --> 1:36:33.048
-

1:36:33.091 --> 1:36:34.789
-Not anymore!

1:36:35.877 --> 1:36:39.402
I am Barb freakin' Quicksilver,
and I have been delivered.

1:36:39.445 --> 1:36:41.099
-I used to be afraid

1:36:41.143 --> 1:36:43.101
of a lot of stuff,
including people like you.

1:36:43.145 --> 1:36:44.407
But I'm not afraid anymore!

1:36:44.842 --> 1:36:46.801
And I know my truth.
I'm a phoenix.

1:36:46.844 --> 1:36:48.933
-Now, my friend,

1:36:48.977 --> 1:36:51.457
Star is really good with words,
and she is gonna speak now!

1:36:51.501 --> 1:36:52.676
You won't be rude through it.

1:36:52.719 --> 1:36:54.199
You won't be rude,
you rude lady!

1:36:55.026 --> 1:36:57.115
-Ha-hoya!
-

1:36:57.724 --> 1:37:00.249
Star, the beach is yours.

1:37:02.077 --> 1:37:03.600
You can do this, Star.

1:37:08.344 --> 1:37:09.345
Hi.

1:37:10.085 --> 1:37:11.826
I know you have a lot of pain.

1:37:12.739 --> 1:37:15.264
You're just trying to hurt
all these people because...

1:37:16.047 --> 1:37:17.832
you're hurting inside yourself.

1:37:18.876 --> 1:37:20.530
But you're not alone.

1:37:21.444 --> 1:37:23.533
I've always been alone.

1:37:24.316 --> 1:37:27.102
Well, that's terrible.
No friends?

1:37:27.929 --> 1:37:29.234
I hate that word.

1:37:30.366 --> 1:37:32.411
Friend is the best word of all.

1:37:32.455 --> 1:37:34.849
I mean, they're there
when you're sad.

1:37:34.892 --> 1:37:37.721
They jump up and down with you
when something good happens.

1:37:37.764 --> 1:37:39.723
Yeah. And you'll spend
your birthdays together

1:37:39.766 --> 1:37:42.421
and stay up late giggling
about boobs and butts and stuff.

1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:46.861
No one ever wants to be...
my friend.

1:37:49.951 --> 1:37:51.343
I'll be your friend.

1:37:51.387 --> 1:37:52.388
What?

1:37:53.955 --> 1:37:54.956
So will I.

1:37:56.305 --> 1:37:57.959
Me too.
I'll be your friend.

1:37:58.002 --> 1:37:59.221
-Me too.
-Me too.

1:37:59.264 --> 1:38:00.309
-Me too.
-Me too.

1:38:00.613 --> 1:38:02.137
I'd very much like
being your friend,

1:38:02.180 --> 1:38:03.486
if you'll take me.

1:38:07.446 --> 1:38:08.404
Edgar?

1:38:09.231 --> 1:38:14.279
Uh... I mean, it's kind of weird
but I guess.

1:38:14.323 --> 1:38:16.107
After everything I've done?

1:38:19.284 --> 1:38:20.503
I'm not going to...

1:38:21.286 --> 1:38:22.940
I'm not gonna get emotional.

1:38:22.984 --> 1:38:24.594
No. No!

1:38:25.551 --> 1:38:27.902
I'm not going to cry. No.

1:38:28.467 --> 1:38:31.035
They're trying to come up,
but no.

1:38:31.079 --> 1:38:32.863
No! No!

1:38:32.907 --> 1:38:35.300
They're coming.
My feelings are coming!

1:38:37.999 --> 1:38:39.130
Yes!

1:38:39.174 --> 1:38:42.220
I'm ready to have friends!

1:38:43.700 --> 1:38:45.963
And now I'm gonna
rush out into the crowd.

1:38:46.007 --> 1:38:47.922
I mean, all of you,
we could giggle

1:38:47.965 --> 1:38:50.489
about boobs and butts.
Who wants to be my first friend?

1:38:50.925 --> 1:38:51.926
We did it.

1:38:56.800 --> 1:38:59.194
Barb, there something
on your chest.

1:39:00.412 --> 1:39:02.719
-It's like you're glowing.
-So are you. On your chest.

1:39:04.286 --> 1:39:05.330
What is...

1:39:07.158 --> 1:39:08.812
It's our shimmer.

1:39:16.951 --> 1:39:18.169
-Edgar.
-That's great.

1:39:18.213 --> 1:39:20.215
-We got our shimmer. I saw hers.
-She saw mine.

1:39:20.258 --> 1:39:21.564
What do you say
we go celebrate

1:39:22.043 --> 1:39:23.087
if I get another
buried treasure.

1:39:23.131 --> 1:39:25.176
-Ooh. That sounds fun.
-Yeah.

1:39:25.220 --> 1:39:27.570
Really fun!
-But actually, um...

1:39:27.613 --> 1:39:29.876
Barb and I have something
we have to do first.

1:39:31.661 --> 1:39:33.532
We found it.
- I can't believe it.

1:39:33.576 --> 1:39:36.100
Well, looks like
Barb and Star

1:39:36.144 --> 1:39:37.797
found some adventure after all.

1:39:38.537 --> 1:39:40.452
I mean, ain't that
what we all want?

1:39:41.105 --> 1:39:43.542
A little love, friendship,
and adventure?

1:39:44.152 --> 1:39:46.763
Well, I hope you learned
something here today.

1:39:46.806 --> 1:39:48.156
I know I did.

1:39:48.199 --> 1:39:50.854
Sometimes you gotta step out
of your box a little

1:39:50.897 --> 1:39:53.465
then you'll know what life
is really about.

1:39:53.509 --> 1:39:55.424
But then again, what do I know?

1:39:55.467 --> 1:39:58.949
I'm just a fun-loving
water spirit named Trish.

1:39:59.602 --> 1:40:01.082
Bye-bye now.

1:40:32.548 --> 1:40:34.506
Hey, middle-aged people.

1:40:34.550 --> 1:40:36.160
You thought this was over?

1:40:37.596 --> 1:40:39.294
You are wrong.

1:40:41.818 --> 1:40:43.428
It's time to boogie!

1:40:43.472 --> 1:40:45.430
What's happenin'?

1:40:45.474 --> 1:40:47.389
This thing crackin'

1:40:49.217 --> 1:40:51.175
And you make it wind

1:40:51.219 --> 1:40:53.221
Shake your body on mine

1:40:53.264 --> 1:40:54.787
Ba-dong-ba-da-bong-bong

1:40:54.831 --> 1:40:57.660
-We keep going? A little more.
-Yeah. Just a little more.

1:40:58.748 --> 1:41:00.880
Shake your body on mine

1:41:00.924 --> 1:41:02.708
Ba-dong-ba-dong-bong

1:41:02.752 --> 1:41:04.667
Shake your body on mine

1:41:04.710 --> 1:41:06.712
Ba-dong-ba-da-bong-bong...

1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:23.381
Shake it left and right
-

1:41:23.425 --> 1:41:26.863
Right into my ride

1:41:26.906 --> 1:41:29.039
Without a doubt

1:41:29.083 --> 1:41:30.997
That they yell about

1:41:31.041 --> 1:41:33.304
Where the women all real...

1:41:33.348 --> 1:41:34.740
It's getting hard to breath
a little bit,

1:41:34.784 --> 1:41:36.046
but I'm gonna keep going.

1:41:36.612 --> 1:41:38.440
Is off the chain

1:41:40.006 --> 1:41:42.008
Dammit, man

1:41:42.574 --> 1:41:44.359
For Sean Paul

1:41:44.402 --> 1:41:46.143
For T-Pain

1:41:46.187 --> 1:41:48.189
Like chitty-chitty bang-bang

1:41:49.929 --> 1:41:51.583
What's happenin'?

1:41:51.627 --> 1:41:53.324
This thing crackin'

1:41:55.196 --> 1:41:57.111
And you make it wind

1:41:57.154 --> 1:41:59.113
Shake your body on mine

1:41:59.156 --> 1:42:00.679
Ba-dong-ba-dong-bong

1:42:00.723 --> 1:42:02.681
Shake your body on mine

1:42:02.725 --> 1:42:04.509
Ba-dong-ba-dong-bong...

1:42:04.553 --> 1:42:06.468
I don't have any sand
in my mouth yet--

1:42:06.511 --> 1:42:07.686
You don't?
- Not yet.

1:42:07.730 --> 1:42:09.210
I can feel a little
granules, like,

1:42:09.253 --> 1:42:11.168
-in between my teeth, like--
- Your teeth? Oh!

1:42:11.212 --> 1:42:12.909
-I just got some. There you go.
- Oh, there you go.

1:42:12.952 --> 1:42:14.693
Ba-dong-ba-dong-bong

1:42:52.992 --> 1:42:55.908
Ah. Can we talk about
horses now?

1:42:56.474 --> 1:42:57.562
Give it to me.

1:44:19.949 --> 1:44:21.124
Woo-hoo.

1:44:33.397 --> 1:44:34.659
My bad.

1:46:36.215 --> 1:46:38.392
There are good ships.
And wood ships.

1:46:38.435 --> 1:46:40.045
And ships that sail the sea.

1:46:40.089 --> 1:46:42.004
But the best ships
are friendships.

1:46:42.047 --> 1:46:43.875
And may they always be.

1:46:45.268 --> 1:46:46.748
I agree.
