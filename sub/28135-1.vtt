(upbeat music)

00:48.618 --> 00:49.451
(woman whimpers)

00:49.451 --> 00:50.284
- Not yet.

00:51.170 --> 00:53.779
Not yet.
(woman gasps)

00:53.779 --> 00:54.612
Shh.

01:07.739 --> 01:09.989
(groaning)

01:17.127 --> 01:19.960
(Vincent sighing)

01:25.721 --> 01:27.888
(snoring)

(mysterious music)

01:53.041 --> 01:55.958
(woman vocalizing)

02:21.170 --> 02:22.240
- I didn't make you cum?

02:22.240 --> 02:23.180
So you're blaming me.

02:23.180 --> 02:24.370
- No, I just...

02:25.290 --> 02:28.200
You know I can't cum
from penetration alone.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.240
- But you were moaning.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.580
You were--
'Cause it's sex.

02:30.580 --> 02:31.830
It felt good.

02:31.830 --> 02:34.090
It just wasn't an orgasm.

02:34.090 --> 02:36.700
- Like I don't know what
an orgasm sounds like?

02:36.700 --> 02:38.190
- No, I know you do.

02:38.190 --> 02:39.420
- Ask anyone I've ever been with.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.360
They've all cum.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.193
- I'm sure.

02:42.193 --> 02:43.220
- Ever since you've gotten laid off,

02:43.220 --> 02:45.350
every goddamn thing has been an issue.

02:45.350 --> 02:46.730
- That is so not true.

02:46.730 --> 02:47.910
- Oh, okay.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.930
- Our sex life has been a
problem for a while now,

02:49.930 --> 02:51.127
and you know that.

02:51.127 --> 02:54.150
- I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were so unsatisfied.

02:54.150 --> 02:55.610
- Oh, because all the bottles of lube

02:55.610 --> 02:57.000
on standby weren't a clue?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.590
- Maybe you just have a dry vagina.

02:58.590 --> 03:01.470
- Maybe you just don't understand
that women need foreplay!

03:01.470 --> 03:05.243
- If you're so unhappy with
this relationship, just say it.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.903
- I'm unhappy.

03:09.075 --> 03:12.242
(gentle guitar music)

03:13.660 --> 03:15.943
I just have to find another place to live.

03:15.943 --> 03:17.590
- [Jules] Dude, come stay with me.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.450
- [Ashley] Jules, I have to find a job.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.950
- [Jules] You'll find a job here.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.470
Ivy may be a small town, but it's dope.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.483
There's cute shops,
great food, cool people.

03:27.590 --> 03:28.710
This is your fresh start.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.402
What do you have to lose?

03:30.402 --> 03:33.402
(upbeat rock music)

03:37.955 --> 03:40.025
(screams)

03:40.025 --> 03:41.100
- [Ashley] Oh.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.360
- Dude, you look so good.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.740
- Well, there's nothing like
getting out a bad relationship

03:45.740 --> 03:47.440
to make a girl look her very best.

03:48.910 --> 03:51.120
This house is awesome.

03:51.120 --> 03:51.953
- I know!

03:51.953 --> 03:53.300
My mom worked her whole life

03:53.300 --> 03:54.590
just so she could afford her own place

03:54.590 --> 03:56.850
and never even got to enjoy it.

03:56.850 --> 03:58.400
- I'm really sorry about your mom.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.957
- I'm not, I mean, how rad is this house?

04:01.957 --> 04:02.940
Come on.

04:02.940 --> 04:04.043
Let me show you around!

04:04.043 --> 04:04.876
- Okay.

04:07.620 --> 04:08.990
I love it.
(Jules squeals)

04:08.990 --> 04:11.700
But I will only be here for a few months.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.620
I have to figure out what I'm doing.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.680
- No, don't figure it out.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.720
Just stay here.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.553
I want you here.

04:16.553 --> 04:17.399
I need you here.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.220
It's not like you can go back
to that shitty relationship.

04:20.220 --> 04:23.010
- I faked it for an entire year.

04:23.010 --> 04:26.177
- Faking it only reinforces bad technique.

04:26.177 --> 04:29.097
"Oh, yes, baby, keep ignoring my clit.

04:29.097 --> 04:30.917
"That's right, keep ignoring it!

04:30.917 --> 04:34.347
"Oh, that finger jabbing's
gonna make me cum so hard."

04:35.610 --> 04:38.310
For future reference, you can
gauge whether someone can fuck

04:38.310 --> 04:40.930
within the first five
seconds of meeting them.

04:40.930 --> 04:42.110
- No, you can't.

04:42.110 --> 04:42.943
- Yeah.

04:42.943 --> 04:45.250
All good fucks have aural fixations.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.120
- Oral.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.570
- Aural.

04:47.570 --> 04:48.540
A person that can fuck

04:48.540 --> 04:50.810
does a lot of ear shit when they talk.

04:50.810 --> 04:52.670
- Okay.
- I'm serious!

04:52.670 --> 04:54.220
What does an earlobe look like?

04:55.770 --> 04:56.860
A clit.

04:56.860 --> 04:59.570
Aural people subconsciously
always have sex on the brain.

04:59.570 --> 05:01.080
- Jules.
- I'm serious.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.760
I'm gonna find you a guy
that'll make you cum.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.160
- By what, asking if he
has an aural fixation?

05:06.160 --> 05:07.500
- Worked for me.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.113
I'm having killer sex right now.

05:10.860 --> 05:12.250
- You're in a relationship?

05:12.250 --> 05:14.230
- No, no, not a relationship.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.820
- Why not?

05:15.820 --> 05:16.920
- Married.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.270
- Oh, God.

05:18.270 --> 05:20.300
- And I work for both of them.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.120
- Jules.
- I know, I know,

05:22.120 --> 05:24.820
I'm going to hell, but at
least I'll see my mom again.

05:26.010 --> 05:27.460
- Where's the bathroom?

05:27.460 --> 05:29.630
Why do you always go after
the people you can't have?

05:29.630 --> 05:32.924
- Why do you always settle
for the ones you don't want?

05:32.924 --> 05:35.507
(gentle music)

05:36.350 --> 05:38.400
- I don't always settle.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.550
- Mm, maybe not.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.450
But remember, safe is easy,

05:42.450 --> 05:44.473
and easy does not make people cum.

05:47.140 --> 05:47.973
Nipple clamps.

05:49.630 --> 05:50.890
For sex.

05:50.890 --> 05:52.820
They're Dylan's, not mine.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.790
- These go on a guy?

05:53.790 --> 05:56.903
- No, no, no, Dylan, the
other roommate, a chick.

05:56.903 --> 05:57.910
- Oh.

05:57.910 --> 05:58.743
- Yeah, but she's chill.

05:58.743 --> 06:01.070
I mean, she's into some,
like, weird kinky shit,

06:01.070 --> 06:02.750
but you'll like her.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.240
- Okay.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.247
- All right, I've got some work
crap I have to take care of

06:06.247 --> 06:08.283
and try not to shoot myself.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.240
There's beer and leftover
tacos in the fridge.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.970
Actually, don't eat the tacos

06:18.970 --> 06:20.076
because I can't remember
when I bought them

06:20.076 --> 06:23.815
and they probably have food poisoning.

06:23.815 --> 06:26.749
(chuckles)

06:26.749 --> 06:29.749
(upbeat rock music)

06:35.426 --> 06:38.426
(door bells jingle)

06:53.629 --> 06:55.133
(woman moaning)
- Oh, yeah!

06:55.133 --> 06:56.315
What, whoa!

06:56.315 --> 06:57.784
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:57.784 --> 06:58.617
Whoa!

06:58.617 --> 06:59.540
Hey!

06:59.540 --> 07:00.480
Hey, hold up a sec!

07:00.480 --> 07:01.460
- No, no, I'll come back later.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.140
- No, no, no. No, no, no, wait.

07:03.140 --> 07:04.640
Wait. Hey.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.500
I am so sorry.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.910
I did not hear you come in.

07:07.910 --> 07:08.743
- I figured.

07:08.743 --> 07:12.190
Yeah, let me grab you a cup of coffee.

07:12.190 --> 07:13.420
On the house.

07:13.420 --> 07:14.380
- You know, I'm fine.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.230
- No, no, no. Please, please.

07:16.230 --> 07:18.170
Our beans come from Kona.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.440
They're really great.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.460
Trust me, they're delicious.

07:20.460 --> 07:21.750
I'll even give you a bag to take home.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.530
Just give me one second.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.313
- Later.
- Yeah, bye.

07:28.310 --> 07:32.523
See, I even washed my hands
before going back to work.

07:33.525 --> 07:34.358
Okay.

07:34.358 --> 07:35.525
- [Ashley] Mm.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.272
- Yeah.

07:40.272 --> 07:41.970
There you go.

07:41.970 --> 07:43.480
Just have a little taste

07:43.480 --> 07:46.033
and tell me that that is not incredible.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.250
(zips)

07:49.250 --> 07:50.083
- It's great.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.831
When will your manager be back in?

07:52.831 --> 07:53.690
(chuckles)

07:53.690 --> 07:54.960
- Why, are you gonna report me?

07:54.960 --> 07:57.053
- No, I was wondering about the job.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.650
- The barista job.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.307
- I guess, there's a sign on your door.

08:01.307 --> 08:02.140
- Yeah, yeah.

08:02.140 --> 08:02.973
Done. Yours.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.160
- You're the manager?

08:05.160 --> 08:06.208
- Owner, actually.

08:06.208 --> 08:07.500
Raif Sterling.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.440
- You're kidding.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.540
- No.

08:09.540 --> 08:11.070
You can start tomorrow.

08:11.070 --> 08:12.770
- Don't you want to interview me?

08:12.770 --> 08:16.270
- You'll make coffee, you'll
grind beans, you'll do fine.

08:16.270 --> 08:17.960
And, you know, don't worry.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.850
I promise I'm much more professional

08:19.850 --> 08:22.000
when there's actually
customers here, so...

08:39.913 --> 08:42.751
(phone clicking)

08:42.751 --> 08:45.334
(phone chimes)

08:46.972 --> 08:47.805
- [Dylan] In the back, you know,

08:47.805 --> 08:49.013
like his dick is in me, right?

08:49.013 --> 08:52.310
And then this fucking chick just shows up

08:52.310 --> 08:53.757
and is staring at us,

08:53.757 --> 08:57.001
like, hardcore.
- Oh, my God, who does that?!

08:57.001 --> 08:58.418
- [Dylan] I know!

08:59.580 --> 09:01.302
- [Jules] Has she never
have had sex before?

09:01.302 --> 09:03.264
- [Dylan] I know, maybe
she was like a virgin

09:03.264 --> 09:05.453
who'd never seen...

09:05.453 --> 09:07.370
- I thought you stopped banging Raif.

09:07.370 --> 09:09.130
- I needed to get laid.

09:09.130 --> 09:12.580
- She was just sitting
there watching you guys?

09:12.580 --> 09:13.500
- Yep.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.570
She couldn't take her eyes off of us.

09:15.570 --> 09:17.644
Total creeper.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.200
(chuckles)

09:19.200 --> 09:20.350
Oh, my God. That's her.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.823
- That's Ashley.

09:24.270 --> 09:26.190
- Talk about a small world.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.960
- I guess a formal
introduction isn't needed,

09:27.960 --> 09:30.690
since you've already seen her vagina.

09:30.690 --> 09:31.680
- Jules.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.513
- I'm Dylan.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.950
- [Ashley] Ashley.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.800
- Welcome to the family.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.483
- So, did you enjoy the
show this morning, Ashley?

09:40.840 --> 09:42.970
- I'm really sorry about that.

09:42.970 --> 09:43.803
- Don't be sorry.

09:43.803 --> 09:46.730
You got a sneak peek at
the world's most epic dick.

09:46.730 --> 09:49.523
- It is perfection, isn't it?

09:51.890 --> 09:53.460
- I didn't really notice.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.830
- It was sculpted by the gods.

09:55.830 --> 09:56.663
- You've seen it?

09:56.663 --> 09:58.520
- I've heard about it.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.890
- It's so thick, you can't
quite fit your fingers

10:01.890 --> 10:03.230
all the way around it.

10:03.230 --> 10:04.950
And it's just the perfect length

10:04.950 --> 10:07.550
that he can totally
plow the shit out of you

10:07.550 --> 10:09.895
and you can still walk
home the next morning.

10:09.895 --> 10:11.922
(Dylan chuckles)

10:11.922 --> 10:13.528
(cell phone ringing)

10:13.528 --> 10:15.530
- God, where can a person find a job

10:15.530 --> 10:17.403
that doesn't require that they work?

10:20.669 --> 10:21.719
Hey, how's Thailand?!

10:24.800 --> 10:25.633
Yeah.

10:26.581 --> 10:27.470
I was over there earlier.

10:27.470 --> 10:28.303
They're fine.

10:29.818 --> 10:31.318
Who told you that?

10:32.428 --> 10:33.928
Well, she's wrong.

10:35.034 --> 10:36.934
They're not dying.
- Lay out with us.

10:38.870 --> 10:41.180
- Oh, I would, but I don't
know where I packed my bikini.

10:41.180 --> 10:43.053
- Are you wearing a bra and panties?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.450
- Yeah.

10:45.450 --> 10:46.550
- There's your bikini.

11:31.526 --> 11:34.026
(ominous hum)

11:40.490 --> 11:41.593
- [Elliott] You're late.

11:42.770 --> 11:43.820
- I'm sorry.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.713
I know your text said eight o'clock.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.433
- Look at me.

11:49.670 --> 11:50.513
Eight sharp.

11:52.710 --> 11:53.910
Did you find a girl yet?

11:55.290 --> 11:56.820
- Not yet.

11:56.820 --> 11:58.020
I'm still working on it.

11:59.630 --> 12:00.480
- That's a shame.

12:04.058 --> 12:06.808
(ethereal music)

12:14.089 --> 12:17.270
- [Ashley Voiceover] My name
is Maura, and I was his slave,

12:17.270 --> 12:19.780
a plain faced girl in a maid uniform

12:19.780 --> 12:21.210
that floated around his house,

12:21.210 --> 12:23.723
taking care of every corner and crevice.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.933
For years, he watched me from a distance.

12:31.770 --> 12:34.720
I wondered if he ever fantasized about me

12:34.720 --> 12:36.183
the way I had of him.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.140
But after a year of waiting,

12:40.140 --> 12:43.223
he finally made the move
I'd been yearning for.

12:48.270 --> 12:50.540
I was distracted by a smudge on the window

12:51.940 --> 12:54.713
when his hand found
the inside of my thigh.

12:59.350 --> 13:03.313
I tensed to his touch, but
my breath came in an exhale.

13:06.980 --> 13:09.164
He ripped my underwear from my body.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.664
(Maura gasps)

13:13.710 --> 13:15.693
I was already wet with excitement.

13:26.296 --> 13:29.220
(man sighs)

13:29.220 --> 13:30.053
- Turn around.

13:51.863 --> 13:53.090
- [Ashley Voiceover]
Should these ropes he used

13:53.090 --> 13:57.853
to tie me down suddenly
break, I would not have moved.

13:59.150 --> 14:00.553
I was enslaved to him,

14:01.560 --> 14:06.020
and it was neither rope or cuff
or belt that kept me there.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.350
- [Man] Where are your eyes?

14:07.350 --> 14:08.760
- [Ashley Voiceover] It
was my unwavering need

14:08.760 --> 14:11.103
to feel his breath against my bare skin.

14:12.020 --> 14:14.780
I waited for the pain
that I knew would come,

14:14.780 --> 14:15.913
not from the flame,

14:17.070 --> 14:19.120
but from the inevitable waning of emotion

14:19.120 --> 14:20.670
that seemed to take hold of every--

14:20.670 --> 14:22.040
- [Dylan] Good morning.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.190
- Oh, my God. You scared me.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.380
- That's my book.

14:25.380 --> 14:28.360
- I'm sorry, I was just
skimming through it.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.653
- You were drooling.

14:30.880 --> 14:31.713
- No, I wasn't.

14:31.713 --> 14:34.330
I don't really like books like this.

14:34.330 --> 14:35.163
- Okay.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.720
But if you change your mind,

14:39.720 --> 14:41.570
I'm having some girls
over on Thursday night

14:41.570 --> 14:42.850
to talk about it.

14:42.850 --> 14:44.500
Book club thing.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.460
- You know what?

14:45.460 --> 14:46.960
That actually sounds like fun.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.630
- Okay.

14:49.630 --> 14:50.833
You can have my copy.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.210
It looks like you wore out
the pages a little bit anyway.

15:03.717 --> 15:06.884
(gentle guitar music)

15:08.410 --> 15:10.810
- Nolan Keats paints a provocative picture

15:10.810 --> 15:12.035
of the BDSM underworld.

15:12.035 --> 15:12.868
- Give me that.

15:12.868 --> 15:13.760
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.030
- I never took you as a closet freak.

15:16.030 --> 15:18.450
- I'm not, and didn't you promise

15:18.450 --> 15:19.830
to be more professional from now on?

15:19.830 --> 15:21.640
- Oh, I lied.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.820
- Of course you did.

15:22.820 --> 15:23.980
- So, what is this?

15:23.980 --> 15:27.170
You don't strike me as a
girl who likes to read smut.

15:27.170 --> 15:29.980
- It's for Dylan's book
club, and it's not smut.

15:29.980 --> 15:31.130
- Oh, okay.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.230
His penis throbbed.

15:33.230 --> 15:35.170
- Okay, you can stop embarrassing me.

15:35.170 --> 15:39.650
- I want to come to the book club.

15:39.650 --> 15:40.530
- Well, you can't.

15:40.530 --> 15:41.910
It's for women only.

15:41.910 --> 15:42.940
- Oh, too bad.

15:42.940 --> 15:44.430
Love to find out why sex books

15:44.430 --> 15:46.390
have suddenly become hip with chicks.

15:46.390 --> 15:47.660
- [Ashley] It's gospel.

15:47.660 --> 15:49.090
- It's a poorly written smut story.

15:49.090 --> 15:50.730
- Oh, just because the writer

15:50.730 --> 15:52.323
has a better understanding of women?

15:52.323 --> 15:54.250
- I have plenty understanding of women.

15:54.250 --> 15:57.120
- Okay, then explain Dylan to me.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.150
- The chick's crazy.

15:58.150 --> 16:00.270
- Yet you slept with her.

16:00.270 --> 16:02.000
- Guys don't have a problem banging crazy

16:02.000 --> 16:03.610
if crazy is hot enough.

16:03.610 --> 16:04.910
- Oh, no, she's not crazy.

16:05.870 --> 16:08.000
- Three months ago, she
fucked a complete stranger

16:08.000 --> 16:09.840
in that bathroom over there.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.003
I'd say that's crazy.

16:11.884 --> 16:12.720
- What?

16:12.720 --> 16:13.920
- Yeah, some guy's girlfriend.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.630
Never even spoken to her before.

16:15.630 --> 16:16.490
- Wow.

16:16.490 --> 16:17.490
- Don't get me wrong.

16:17.490 --> 16:18.920
There's nothing wrong with casual sex.

16:18.920 --> 16:22.040
Casual sex is fucking
great, but Dylan's weird.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.230
- Why, because she's as
emotionally unavailable as you are?

16:25.230 --> 16:26.230
- Pretty much, yeah.

16:26.230 --> 16:27.930
- I don't know, I think it's kind of cool

16:27.930 --> 16:30.290
that a woman can be that spontaneous.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.540
- Oh, well, maybe you
should try it sometime.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.420
- Who wouldn't want to
get nailed like that?

16:42.420 --> 16:43.600
- [Tina] I wouldn't.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.110
It was textbook abuse.

16:45.110 --> 16:46.220
- It was not.

16:46.220 --> 16:48.770
- Maura was clearly a victim
of Stockholm syndrome.

16:48.770 --> 16:50.210
- Oh, okay, that's extreme.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.480
- It was full on coercion.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.420
He was in a position of power.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.920
- Who cares if it was a position of power?

16:54.920 --> 16:57.440
- Kim, he used a riding crop on Olivia

16:57.440 --> 16:59.129
like she was some kind of animal.

16:59.129 --> 17:01.420
(riding crop cracks)
(Olivia yelps)

17:01.420 --> 17:03.540
- Okay, so it's kinky--

17:03.540 --> 17:05.890
- And he yanked that other
one around with a leash.

17:05.890 --> 17:07.520
- [Man] Suck it.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.410
- [Kim] Calm down.

17:08.410 --> 17:09.839
It was just role-play.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.240
- [Tina] It was not just role-play.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.599
He forced them into actual slavery.

17:14.599 --> 17:18.363
- And yet they couldn't
stop fantasizing about him.

17:19.430 --> 17:23.000
- Of course they couldn't,
because it was written by a man.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.640
- So they say.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.109
- Please don't tell me
you are buying into that

17:27.109 --> 17:29.690
it was written by a woman bullshit.

17:29.690 --> 17:31.340
- Well, maybe it was.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.490
- So if a woman wrote it,

17:33.490 --> 17:36.590
then we should be completely
okay with misogyny, right?

17:36.590 --> 17:38.680
- No, that has nothing to do with it.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.340
- That has everything to do with it.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.880
Society wants us to believe

17:41.880 --> 17:44.400
that women are like these
pathetic little creatures

17:44.400 --> 17:47.250
that live and die by a man's happiness.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.230
- Why is it pathetic if a
woman wants to submit to a man?

17:50.230 --> 17:51.440
- Are you serious?

17:51.440 --> 17:55.063
- It isn't pathetic, and more
women should give it a try.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.429
(phone clicking)

17:59.429 --> 18:02.012
(phone chimes)

18:06.794 --> 18:08.794
(sighs)

18:17.252 --> 18:18.085
- Okay.

18:19.730 --> 18:23.230
The current identity of
Nolan Keats is unknown.

18:23.230 --> 18:25.980
Many have suspected that the
writer is actually a woman

18:26.910 --> 18:28.650
working under a pen name.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.710
Keats's literary agent recently announced

18:30.710 --> 18:33.970
that there will be no book tour for Slave,

18:33.970 --> 18:37.293
further fueling suspicions
about his or her identity.

18:45.230 --> 18:48.063
(car alarm beeps)

18:53.313 --> 18:55.896
(gentle music)

19:16.430 --> 19:17.930
- I'm rolling around in your bed right now

19:17.930 --> 19:19.233
so I can smell you.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.430
That's how bad it's gotten.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.053
So have you had the conversation yet?

19:29.630 --> 19:30.663
Okay, then when?

19:32.319 --> 19:33.530
(sighs)

19:33.530 --> 19:35.950
Do you know how hard it
is to be here in your bed

19:35.950 --> 19:38.627
when you're motocrossing
all the way in Fuckit?

19:40.040 --> 19:41.490
Who get, whatever.

19:41.490 --> 19:43.450
How am I supposed to know
how to pronounce a place

19:43.450 --> 19:45.603
halfway across the world?
(phone buzzing)

19:45.603 --> 19:46.850
Oh, shit, that's my roommate.

19:46.850 --> 19:47.683
Hang on.

19:50.420 --> 19:51.253
What up?

19:51.253 --> 19:53.550
- Dylan just put Chelsea in her car,

19:53.550 --> 19:56.110
handcuffed and blindfolded.

19:56.110 --> 19:56.943
- Okay.

19:58.190 --> 19:59.023
- Okay?

19:59.023 --> 20:01.220
So you don't think
that's a little bizarre?

20:01.220 --> 20:02.110
- Dude, it's Dylan.

20:02.110 --> 20:04.120
I told you, she's into some freaky shit.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.820
- But what was she doing?

20:06.820 --> 20:07.970
- Who knows? Who cares?

20:07.970 --> 20:10.600
I'm dealing with an
actual crisis right now.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.650
- Why? What happened?

20:13.690 --> 20:14.523
Jules.

20:19.528 --> 20:21.361
- Are you still there?

20:22.830 --> 20:24.140
Of course you have to go.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.200
You always have to go.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.920
And I'm just here, alone,
smelling your sheets,

20:29.920 --> 20:31.603
impaled by a bunch of swords.

20:33.820 --> 20:34.773
It's a metaphor.

20:36.340 --> 20:40.000
So, when you get back,
you have to have the talk.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.333
I'm slowly dying here without you.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.720
- Oh, my God, I am so glad you're here.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.010
- Yeah, well, told you she was crazy.

20:55.010 --> 20:58.330
- Give me one logical reason
why somebody would do that?

20:58.330 --> 21:00.920
- Dylan's not a logical
person, so I can't.

21:02.550 --> 21:04.950
- But, I mean, that girl's
gonna be okay, right?

21:05.940 --> 21:07.093
- Yeah, of course.

21:08.140 --> 21:09.958
Do you realize how crazy you sound?

21:09.958 --> 21:10.791
(chuckles)

21:10.791 --> 21:12.410
- No.

21:12.410 --> 21:14.803
- Okay, you need another beer.

21:17.020 --> 21:19.840
- Okay, you can make
fun of me all you want,

21:19.840 --> 21:24.780
but Keats writes men

21:24.780 --> 21:26.450
that women actually want.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.920
- Mm-hm.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.603
- It's like aggression
is this lost art form.

21:32.640 --> 21:36.973
Men have become these
like passive little boys.

21:37.863 --> 21:38.900
- Oh, have they?

21:38.900 --> 21:40.960
- Yes.
- All right.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.330
- Women just want a guy
who can, you know, like,

21:43.330 --> 21:46.633
throw down and get dirty, you know?

21:51.810 --> 21:52.915
- Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

21:52.915 --> 21:54.043
- Oh, what--
- Raif, no.

21:54.043 --> 21:55.010
- What?

21:55.010 --> 21:56.120
- We are not doing this.

21:56.120 --> 21:56.953
- Why not?

21:56.953 --> 21:59.150
- Because I'm drunk.

21:59.150 --> 22:02.390
- Mm-hm.
- And you're kind of drunk.

22:02.390 --> 22:03.985
- Yeah.
- No.

22:03.985 --> 22:05.227
No.

22:05.227 --> 22:07.810
(upbeat music)

22:15.582 --> 22:16.415
(Raif grunts)

22:16.415 --> 22:18.915
(Raif laughs)

22:24.750 --> 22:26.171
- [Raif] Wait, where are you going?

22:26.171 --> 22:27.004
- Jeez.

22:32.172 --> 22:34.755
(gentle music)

22:53.451 --> 22:54.330
Oh.

22:54.330 --> 22:55.600
- Last night was fun.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.500
- Yeah, okay, Raif, there's customers.

23:00.080 --> 23:03.520
- There's one customer,
and we can go in the back.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.120
- [Ashley] Stop.

23:05.120 --> 23:05.980
- What's wrong?

23:05.980 --> 23:08.860
- I don't want to talk
about this stuff at work.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.983
- We could talk about
it at my place later.

23:12.830 --> 23:14.776
I'll be right back.

23:14.776 --> 23:16.776
(sighs)

23:26.110 --> 23:27.440
- Good morning.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.420
- Oh, yes, it is.

23:30.420 --> 23:31.670
- Why? What happened?

23:31.670 --> 23:32.870
- Raif was pulling out of the driveway

23:32.870 --> 23:34.400
when I got home this morning.

23:34.400 --> 23:37.720
- Looks like the good
girl had a bad girl night.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.380
- It's not what you think.

23:39.380 --> 23:42.462
- It's exactly what we think.

23:42.462 --> 23:43.629
- Was it epic?

23:44.610 --> 23:47.850
- It was fine.

23:47.850 --> 23:48.870
- Fine?

23:48.870 --> 23:51.280
- Yeah, it was just fine.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.580
- Fine is shit!

23:52.580 --> 23:55.060
Fine is not what you need right now.

23:55.060 --> 23:59.270
I want every horrific detail,
but first I gotta go pee.

23:59.270 --> 24:00.103
Get me a coffee?

24:07.020 --> 24:08.623
- You didn't tell her, did you?

24:10.460 --> 24:11.293
- About what?

24:12.860 --> 24:15.030
- The surprise party.

24:15.030 --> 24:17.080
- Oh, no, I wouldn't do that.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.010
- Because she was asking
if the three of us

24:19.010 --> 24:20.290
wanted to hang on Saturday,

24:20.290 --> 24:22.690
so I thought maybe she
suspected something.

24:22.690 --> 24:23.640
- No, I would never do that.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.210
I know how to keep a secret.

24:25.210 --> 24:26.060
- Good to know.

24:26.060 --> 24:27.593
Too bad Raif doesn't.

24:28.572 --> 24:33.572
(upbeat music)
(people chattering)

24:50.623 --> 24:52.796
(Jules squealing)

24:52.796 --> 24:55.594
- [Jules] Hi!

24:55.594 --> 24:56.920
- How are you?

24:56.920 --> 24:57.753
- Thank you.

24:58.674 --> 24:59.507
Ash.

25:00.518 --> 25:01.560
- Excuse me for a second.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.477
- Oh, sure.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.160
- Hi.
- Ash, these are my bosses,

25:07.160 --> 25:08.420
Scarlet and Tomas.

25:08.420 --> 25:09.770
- Oh, it's very nice to meet you.

25:09.770 --> 25:10.603
- Our pleasure.

25:10.603 --> 25:12.110
- I've heard wonderful things.

25:12.110 --> 25:13.310
- Not from Jules, I'm sure.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.580
- Shut up, you know I love you.

25:15.580 --> 25:16.750
- Cranberry vodka?

25:16.750 --> 25:17.583
- Please.

25:20.510 --> 25:22.993
Birthday girl, show me where the bar is.

25:24.380 --> 25:27.493
- Better watch out, I'm gonna
steal your husband away.

25:30.850 --> 25:33.016
- Jules just adores you.

25:33.016 --> 25:34.543
- Well, she is the best.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.420
- I will scold her for not
telling me how beautiful you are.

25:38.420 --> 25:41.610
- Oh, that's very nice of you to say.

25:41.610 --> 25:42.683
- And very honest.

25:43.570 --> 25:45.320
I'd love to photograph you sometime.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.330
Do you model?
- Oh, I used to a little bit

25:47.330 --> 25:49.623
in high school, but not anymore.

25:50.733 --> 25:53.048
- Would you take your clothes off?

25:53.048 --> 25:56.137
- So, how was Fuckit?

25:57.987 --> 25:59.053
- Do you even care?

26:01.240 --> 26:03.130
- Not particularly.

26:03.130 --> 26:04.623
- So why would you ask?

26:06.290 --> 26:08.510
- Because pretending like I care

26:08.510 --> 26:10.533
gets me further with you than honesty.

26:13.140 --> 26:14.437
- You're drunk.

26:14.437 --> 26:16.100
- Not drunk enough.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.660
- It's not nudity in
the exploitative sense.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.603
It's erotic art.

26:20.860 --> 26:23.240
- Either way, I don't take off my clothes

26:23.240 --> 26:25.220
in front of cameras.

26:25.220 --> 26:26.270
- Think about it.

26:26.270 --> 26:27.600
It's liberating.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.833
And I won't even keep
the digital pictures.

26:30.870 --> 26:32.950
And you can pose with Jules.

26:32.950 --> 26:34.700
She's been begging me to shoot her.

26:35.807 --> 26:38.150
I think she likes the idea of her pictures

26:38.150 --> 26:39.790
hanging in our living room.

26:39.790 --> 26:41.653
- I bet she does.

26:45.082 --> 26:46.772
Could you excuse me for just one second?

26:46.772 --> 26:47.772
- Of course.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.210
- No more hiding from Raif.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.830
- I wasn't.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.993
- Dude, I am not blind.

27:14.870 --> 27:15.970
- I can't help it.

27:15.970 --> 27:18.640
It's just that work has been so awkward.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.400
It's like a nightmare.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.390
- You're making it a nightmare.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.680
What's the worst that could happen?

27:23.680 --> 27:28.680
He fucks you again, and then
maybe this time you like it.

27:29.140 --> 27:30.110
Boom.

27:30.110 --> 27:31.840
- Yeah, or just makes it more awkward

27:31.840 --> 27:34.350
because I don't know how I feel about him.

27:34.350 --> 27:35.420
- Don't overthink it.

27:35.420 --> 27:36.900
Just play it cool,

27:36.900 --> 27:40.680
especially if there's
a chance you like him.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.670
- Maybe you should play it cool.

27:42.670 --> 27:43.777
- What?

27:43.777 --> 27:46.680
- "Better watch out, I might
steal your husband away."

27:46.680 --> 27:48.024
Really, Jules?

27:48.024 --> 27:48.857
- What?

27:48.857 --> 27:51.150
- You're parading him around
right in front of her.

27:51.150 --> 27:53.230
- Ashley.
- And she is so sweet

27:53.230 --> 27:55.113
and she really likes you.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.930
- [Dylan] What are your hard nos?

27:57.930 --> 27:59.440
- Hard nos are a cop out.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.250
- I totally agree.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.140
- Beg for the pain,
don't shy away from it.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.580
- Exactly.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.540
- Can I get you another shot?

28:06.540 --> 28:09.040
- You know all the right
things to say, don't you?

28:15.096 --> 28:17.679
(gentle music)

28:36.140 --> 28:37.483
This is a party.

28:38.670 --> 28:40.193
No more maid service.

29:00.060 --> 29:01.650
- Mm-mm.
- Mm.

29:01.650 --> 29:03.587
- You are so fucking sexy.

29:03.587 --> 29:04.847
- I wasn't trying to be.

29:04.847 --> 29:07.283
- I think that is the best part.

29:11.420 --> 29:14.193
- Happy birthday to the
baddest bitch I know.

29:18.410 --> 29:19.793
- Halfway to 50.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.900
- And you've got a whole lifetime

29:22.900 --> 29:24.850
of amazing sex ahead of you.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.490
- [Tina] She's got to find someone first.

29:26.490 --> 29:27.500
- [Kim] She'll find someone.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.050
- Well, I haven't found someone.

29:29.050 --> 29:30.370
- Yeah, but there are
a whole slew of reasons

29:30.370 --> 29:31.255
you're still single.

29:31.255 --> 29:32.360
(chuckles)

29:32.360 --> 29:33.460
- You're such a bitch.

29:34.580 --> 29:36.850
- Can I talk to you privately?

29:36.850 --> 29:39.410
- No more shots without me, ladies.

29:39.410 --> 29:40.243
- Never.

29:42.470 --> 29:43.863
- Somebody's in trouble.

29:45.003 --> 29:46.660
- Uh-huh.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.960
- I've got a girl for you.

29:48.864 --> 29:49.697
- Is it her?

29:50.560 --> 29:51.710
- Ashley?

29:51.710 --> 29:52.800
No, she's--

29:52.800 --> 29:53.633
- Dangerous.

29:54.810 --> 29:56.403
- In a relationship.

29:56.403 --> 29:58.505
(chuckles)

29:58.505 --> 30:00.055
- That never stopped us before.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.623
- She's also off limits.

30:03.955 --> 30:06.827
- I decide who's off limits.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.893
- So, you're stealing my
husband away, are you?

30:20.020 --> 30:22.363
- You know I'd never do that.

30:24.060 --> 30:26.127
I might steal you away, though.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.670
- I'm down for anything.

30:35.670 --> 30:36.503
You decide.

30:36.503 --> 30:37.770
The dirtier the better.

30:37.770 --> 30:39.483
- Nothing's off limits.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.220
- You set the rules.

30:42.220 --> 30:43.173
I obey them.

30:50.490 --> 30:52.340
- If you'll excuse me for one moment.

30:55.597 --> 30:56.810
- I'm sorry.

30:56.810 --> 30:59.560
Elliott's version of foreplay
is leaving women hanging.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.293
- Hey, why are you being like this?

31:09.293 --> 31:11.020
- Because I'm not in the mood.

31:11.020 --> 31:11.853
- Stop being so shy.

31:11.853 --> 31:13.350
You weren't shy the other night.

31:13.350 --> 31:14.253
- No. No, Raif.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.000
- Weren't you the one that said aggression

31:17.000 --> 31:18.540
was a lost art form?

31:18.540 --> 31:20.220
- This is not what I meant by that.

31:20.220 --> 31:21.270
- Hey!

31:21.270 --> 31:22.103
Let her go.

31:24.580 --> 31:25.413
- Who the fuck are you?

31:25.413 --> 31:26.380
There's hall monitors?

31:26.380 --> 31:28.800
This party's got a hall monitor?

31:28.800 --> 31:31.020
- I'll stand here all night,

31:31.020 --> 31:32.970
but I'm not leaving her alone with you.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.640
- You're way too fucking sober.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.903
I'm grabbing you a beer.

31:55.991 --> 31:58.750
(knocking)

31:58.750 --> 31:59.583
- You okay?

32:01.290 --> 32:02.123
- Yeah.

32:03.030 --> 32:05.450
He's usually a pretty nice guy.

32:05.450 --> 32:06.400
He's just--

32:06.400 --> 32:07.233
- Drunk.

32:10.620 --> 32:11.963
I'm Elliott, by the way.

32:14.850 --> 32:15.683
- Ashley.

32:19.630 --> 32:20.630
- Is this your room?

32:22.200 --> 32:23.490
- Yeah.

32:23.490 --> 32:24.533
Kind of a mess.

32:25.810 --> 32:26.993
- I don't mind a mess.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.953
That's quite an interesting
book you've got over there.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.783
- [Ashley] It was for a book club.

32:39.783 --> 32:40.616
- Ah.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.370
Who is your favorite character?

32:45.770 --> 32:46.633
- You've read it?

32:50.159 --> 32:51.760
- I have.

32:51.760 --> 32:52.860
- I don't believe you.

32:53.980 --> 32:54.813
- It's true.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.400
- Well, what did you think?

32:57.400 --> 32:59.113
Most men think it's just smut.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.733
- What's wrong with smut?

33:03.960 --> 33:04.793
- Exactly.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.513
Um.

33:11.070 --> 33:11.963
Uh, Maura.

33:12.970 --> 33:15.590
Maura was my favorite character.

33:15.590 --> 33:17.680
- She was quite the contradiction.

33:17.680 --> 33:22.263
She was demure, but very powerful.

33:23.150 --> 33:25.283
- She had no idea how powerful.

33:31.060 --> 33:33.460
You know, most men just make fun of it,

33:33.460 --> 33:36.760
but, you know, Keats really understands

33:36.760 --> 33:39.773
the complexities of female sexuality.

33:40.650 --> 33:44.269
And I can't believe I just said
that to a complete stranger.

33:44.269 --> 33:45.230
- Why?

33:45.230 --> 33:46.780
- You know, I read online somewhere

33:46.780 --> 33:50.020
that Keats is probably a woman,

33:50.020 --> 33:51.067
which is heartbreaking because--

33:51.067 --> 33:52.647
- He's very much a man.

33:55.330 --> 33:56.540
- How do you know that?

33:56.540 --> 34:00.027
- Because I'm him.

34:00.027 --> 34:01.960
(chuckles)

34:01.960 --> 34:04.850
- Ah, you're Nolan Keats?

34:04.850 --> 34:06.400
- Yes.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.343
It's my pen name.

34:08.330 --> 34:09.592
- I don't believe you.

34:11.870 --> 34:12.920
- Give me your phone.

34:20.730 --> 34:21.889
- [Ashley] Why?

34:21.889 --> 34:22.983
- Just trust me.

34:26.982 --> 34:27.815
(phone ringing)

34:27.815 --> 34:29.732
Let it go to voicemail.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.989
- [Woman] You've reached the
voicemail of Nolan Keats.

34:35.989 --> 34:37.183
Please leave a message.

34:38.340 --> 34:39.690
- How'd you get his number?

34:40.650 --> 34:41.699
- You still don't believe me.

34:41.699 --> 34:42.639
- No.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.870
Nobody knows who he is.

34:44.870 --> 34:48.043
- A few do, and now you're one of them.

34:50.719 --> 34:51.553
- Why would you tell me?

34:51.553 --> 34:52.620
You don't even know me.

34:53.550 --> 34:56.300
- I'm a pretty good judge of character.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.050
I'm fairly certain I can trust you.

34:59.340 --> 35:01.727
If you still need proof,
I can give it to you.

35:02.569 --> 35:03.402
- How?

35:05.970 --> 35:09.060
- Well, you two look like
you're up to no good.

35:09.060 --> 35:11.930
- I was just heading to the bathroom.

35:11.930 --> 35:14.180
- Well, it's not in Ashley's bedroom.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.130
It's down the hall.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.550
- It was nice meeting you.

35:21.390 --> 35:23.430
- Jules is looking for you.

35:23.430 --> 35:24.610
- Okay.

35:24.610 --> 35:26.973
- And your boyfriend
puked on the front lawn.

35:28.670 --> 35:30.320
- [Ashley] He's not my boyfriend.

36:23.980 --> 36:24.813
Jules.

36:24.813 --> 36:26.520
- But it's complicated.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.090
There's all these entanglements,

36:28.090 --> 36:30.690
the fucking photography business,

36:30.690 --> 36:33.713
a condo with these exotic plants.

36:34.850 --> 36:37.190
It's like you can't get married anymore

36:37.190 --> 36:39.310
without having all these commitments.

36:39.310 --> 36:42.730
- Well, that's what marriage
is, Jules: commitments.

36:42.730 --> 36:45.303
- I didn't set out to break up a marriage.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.490
I didn't even make the first move.

36:52.490 --> 36:55.490
I was just driving us to
this photography place,

36:55.490 --> 36:57.420
and the next thing I know,

36:57.420 --> 37:00.882
she's feeling me up at a
stoplight and I have no idea--

37:00.882 --> 37:01.715
- Uh.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.390
She?

37:04.390 --> 37:05.323
- Scarlet.

37:06.410 --> 37:08.973
- I thought you were having
an affair with Tomas.

37:10.548 --> 37:12.631
(laughs)

37:13.490 --> 37:16.400
- Dude, are you fucking kidding?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.700
The guy's a total douche.

37:18.700 --> 37:19.890
- Well, how was I supposed to know?

37:19.890 --> 37:21.800
You're hanging on him all night and...

37:23.950 --> 37:24.783
Wait a minute.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.820
Does this mean you're gay?

37:28.800 --> 37:29.900
- I don't like labels.

37:32.869 --> 37:35.452
(gentle music)

37:39.830 --> 37:41.983
- It's not a perfect fit.

37:46.650 --> 37:47.483
- Come here.

37:50.750 --> 37:51.707
Turn around.

37:57.070 --> 37:58.283
Looks good to me.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.160
Put your foot here.

38:07.940 --> 38:10.200
Tonight is all about role-play.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.150
- I like role-play.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.593
- I want you to be a
virgin, an innocent girl.

38:45.357 --> 38:46.190
- Mail.

39:14.658 --> 39:17.325
(phone ringing)

39:21.440 --> 39:22.600
- Hello.

39:22.600 --> 39:23.713
- Did you get my gift?

39:25.730 --> 39:27.550
- I did.

39:27.550 --> 39:28.820
Thank you.

39:28.820 --> 39:30.640
- [Elliott] So now do you believe me?

39:30.640 --> 39:32.660
- I'm sorry I didn't before.

39:32.660 --> 39:34.080
- I don't blame you.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.630
It's good to be skeptical of strangers.

39:36.630 --> 39:38.100
- [Ashley] So is this the new book

39:38.100 --> 39:40.240
you have coming out in the fall?

39:40.240 --> 39:41.073
- Yes.

39:42.090 --> 39:42.923
- Wow.

39:45.380 --> 39:46.213
- [Elliott] What?

39:47.050 --> 39:48.160
- Oh.

39:48.160 --> 39:51.720
Okay, so when I heard there
was a second book coming out,

39:51.720 --> 39:54.450
I freaked, I got so excited.

39:54.450 --> 39:56.960
- Well, I hope this one
doesn't disappoint, then.

39:56.960 --> 39:57.990
- Oh, it won't.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.423
You're brilliant.

40:01.220 --> 40:06.220
In fact, I've been trying to
figure out a way to contact you

40:06.500 --> 40:09.800
ever since I read Slave
so I could tell you that.

40:09.800 --> 40:10.633
- Really?

40:10.633 --> 40:12.060
- I think, more than anything,

40:12.060 --> 40:14.443
I just wanted to say thank you.

40:15.410 --> 40:16.423
- [Elliott] For what?

40:17.520 --> 40:21.270
- That book completely
changed my entire perspective

40:21.270 --> 40:26.000
on sex and love, and it opened
up this part of me that--

40:26.000 --> 40:28.810
- Dude, Tomas wants them to
renew their wedding vows!

40:28.810 --> 40:30.130
- Okay. We'll talk about it later.

40:30.130 --> 40:31.670
- She hasn't told him she's leaving him!

40:31.670 --> 40:33.277
What the fuck?!

40:42.270 --> 40:43.103
- Hello?

40:44.720 --> 40:45.650
- I'm still here.

40:45.650 --> 40:46.483
- Oh, sorry.

40:46.483 --> 40:48.033
My roommate was having a crisis.

40:49.250 --> 40:50.220
What was I saying?

40:50.220 --> 40:52.960
- How my book changed
your perspective on sex.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.263
- Oh, right.

40:55.840 --> 40:59.650
Yeah, it flipped on this switch inside me,

40:59.650 --> 41:02.523
and I haven't been the same since.

41:03.670 --> 41:04.503
- Elaborate.

41:06.130 --> 41:06.963
- Um.

41:09.980 --> 41:14.253
I had the most intense orgasm
of my life reading your book.

41:20.010 --> 41:20.843
Hello?

41:22.490 --> 41:23.833
- [Elliott] I'll call you tomorrow.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.500
(gentle music)

41:31.780 --> 41:32.920
- No more games.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.520
- Jules, he's on his way back.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.340
- You have to tell him about us.

41:36.340 --> 41:37.770
- I will.

41:37.770 --> 41:38.860
- This is masochism,

41:38.860 --> 41:40.950
asking me to help plan a second wedding?

41:40.950 --> 41:42.000
- I didn't ask you.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.870
- No, he did, because you haven't told him

41:43.870 --> 41:45.030
you're leaving him.

41:45.030 --> 41:45.863
Why?

41:47.080 --> 41:48.260
- I'm waiting for the right time.

41:48.260 --> 41:49.510
- This is the right time.

41:52.337 --> 41:53.823
End it or I'm done.

42:00.190 --> 42:02.823
- I'm getting really tired
of you telling me no.

42:04.979 --> 42:06.810
- Well, if you're such
a fan of giving orders,

42:06.810 --> 42:08.760
why don't you find your own submissive?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.280
- I prefer being on my knees,

42:12.280 --> 42:14.770
begging you to give me what I want.

42:14.770 --> 42:15.603
- What is that?

42:17.260 --> 42:18.753
- I want to fuck you.

42:22.130 --> 42:23.230
It's been a while.

42:23.230 --> 42:24.763
You're frustrating me.

42:26.920 --> 42:27.770
- I've been busy.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.370
- What if I find us someone--

42:34.370 --> 42:35.600
- Dylan.
- Someone we can both

42:35.600 --> 42:36.910
have fun with?

42:36.910 --> 42:39.600
You know that I know what you like.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.700
- I'll think about it.

42:41.550 --> 42:43.930
- Why are you doing this to me?

42:43.930 --> 42:47.100
- Because any good submissive
should learn restraint,

42:47.100 --> 42:49.150
and for whatever reason, you haven't yet.

42:52.180 --> 42:53.253
- God, I hate you.

42:59.730 --> 43:01.043
- You wish you hated me.

43:09.202 --> 43:10.360
(sighs)

43:10.360 --> 43:12.240
- And the thing is, she just
keeps giving me the runaround,

43:12.240 --> 43:14.120
making me believe that I'm her soulmate,

43:14.120 --> 43:15.830
when really, I'm just, like,

43:15.830 --> 43:17.000
her lesbo mistress.
(phone ringing)

43:17.000 --> 43:19.270
And I've read so many
stories about mistresses,

43:19.270 --> 43:21.090
and they, like, never come out on top,

43:21.090 --> 43:22.210
like, ever.
- Hello?

43:22.210 --> 43:23.390
- What I need is--

43:23.390 --> 43:24.860
- [Elliott] Go somewhere private.

43:24.860 --> 43:27.317
- Evidence that proves that she's, like--

43:27.317 --> 43:28.360
- I--
- I don't know,

43:28.360 --> 43:29.500
really cares about me.

43:29.500 --> 43:30.713
- I've got to take this.

43:31.930 --> 43:33.630
- Okay, but hurry the fuck up,

43:33.630 --> 43:34.463
because we've got to figure this out!

43:34.463 --> 43:35.393
- Okay. Okay.

43:41.892 --> 43:42.725
(sighs)

43:42.725 --> 43:46.890
- I want you to turn two
chapter two of Owned.

43:46.890 --> 43:47.793
- Okay.

43:49.150 --> 43:49.983
Why?

43:49.983 --> 43:51.873
- I want you to read it out loud to me.

43:53.328 --> 43:56.178
Want to hear how my words
sound coming out of your mouth.

43:57.470 --> 43:58.882
- Okay, but I--

43:58.882 --> 44:00.382
- [Elliott] Do it.

44:14.740 --> 44:17.313
- I was wet before he even touched me,

44:18.400 --> 44:21.603
aching for him to open me
up and to crawl inside.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.053
No tenderness.

44:27.800 --> 44:30.113
My knees weakened to his touch.

44:31.460 --> 44:36.200
I'd just met him and yet my
body was no longer my own.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.100
And--
- Finish the rest of the book

44:38.100 --> 44:39.100
by tomorrow morning.

44:40.960 --> 44:41.840
- No problem.

44:43.028 --> 44:45.500
- [Elliott] But you have
to promise me one thing.

44:45.500 --> 44:46.560
- Okay.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.850
- No masturbating until I say so.

44:48.850 --> 44:50.030
- What?

44:50.030 --> 44:51.873
- I'll tell you when to cum.

44:53.460 --> 44:54.580
- You're kidding.

44:54.580 --> 44:57.550
- If you think my books excite you,

44:57.550 --> 44:59.750
imagine how intense the
real thing could be.

45:06.621 --> 45:07.560
(door rumbles)

45:07.560 --> 45:09.410
- I know how we can get the evidence!

45:12.450 --> 45:14.180
Dude, it's genius.

45:14.180 --> 45:15.640
- It's messed up.

45:15.640 --> 45:17.380
- Hell, Scarlet asked
you to model for her.

45:17.380 --> 45:19.150
You're just doing what she wants.

45:19.150 --> 45:21.920
- Yeah, but I don't want to do it.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.080
- She won't suspect anything.

45:23.080 --> 45:25.380
Just get her to start talking to you.

45:25.380 --> 45:26.650
Tell her how much you dig her artwork,

45:26.650 --> 45:28.030
how creative and talented she is,

45:28.030 --> 45:30.390
and then, boom, ask her if
she's leaving her husband.

45:30.390 --> 45:32.300
- Okay, this is so not subtle.

45:32.300 --> 45:34.160
- Well, then, figure out
what you're gonna say,

45:34.160 --> 45:36.300
because I booked you an
appointment on Thursday.

45:36.300 --> 45:37.343
- You're kidding me.

45:39.080 --> 45:39.913
- Nope.

45:42.563 --> 45:45.730
(gentle guitar music)

45:52.290 --> 45:54.590
- [Elliott] Dear Ashley,
I'd like to invite you

45:54.590 --> 45:56.640
a little deeper into my world.

45:56.640 --> 45:59.010
How would you feel about a
real-life submissive experience

45:59.010 --> 46:00.970
with me as your guide?

46:00.970 --> 46:02.720
If this piques your interest,

46:02.720 --> 46:05.893
enclosed you'll find a sealed
envelope with your first task.

46:09.220 --> 46:12.750
Don't open it unless you're
willing to venture down a dark

46:12.750 --> 46:14.463
and twisted rabbit hole with me.

46:26.586 --> 46:28.750
- [Ashley] Here you go.

46:28.750 --> 46:30.154
- Oh.

46:30.154 --> 46:31.112
Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

46:31.112 --> 46:32.212
- Thank you very much.

46:35.030 --> 46:37.340
- Hey, no more refills for that guy.

46:37.340 --> 46:39.210
- I thought it was unlimited refills.

46:39.210 --> 46:41.603
- He's pouring it in the fucking plant.

46:44.040 --> 46:45.100
- Why would he do that?

46:45.100 --> 46:48.900
- So he can keep coming back
up here to stare at your tits.

46:48.900 --> 46:51.290
What were you thinking
not wearing a bra today?

46:51.290 --> 46:53.420
Go in the back, put on my flannel.

46:53.420 --> 46:54.660
- I can't.

46:54.660 --> 46:55.493
- Do it.

46:56.570 --> 46:58.087
- My boss sent me home.

46:58.087 --> 47:00.080
- [Elliott] But your
first task was successful.

47:00.080 --> 47:01.890
- I'm totally humiliated.

47:01.890 --> 47:03.200
- [Elliot] The point is to push you

47:03.200 --> 47:04.450
beyond your comfort zone.

47:05.418 --> 47:06.519
Enjoy it.

47:06.519 --> 47:09.686
(elegant piano music)

47:16.500 --> 47:18.240
- Now, where's that shy girl

47:18.240 --> 47:20.590
who didn't want to pose
for me the other night?

47:23.090 --> 47:25.110
- She's trying to be a little bolder.

47:25.110 --> 47:27.770
- Well, there's nothing
to be nervous about.

47:27.770 --> 47:31.020
All right, so keep the robe on,

47:31.020 --> 47:35.033
but let it drape off your
shoulder a little bit.

47:39.210 --> 47:40.460
You should be proud of yourself

47:40.460 --> 47:42.971
for embracing an adventurous spirit.

47:42.971 --> 47:45.554
(camera snaps)

47:48.389 --> 47:51.123
We've all become so scared
to take any risks anymore.

47:52.350 --> 47:54.629
Become slaves to our own boring lives.

47:54.629 --> 47:56.570
(camera snaps)

47:56.570 --> 48:01.570
All of us, slaves to our
jobs, our bank accounts.

48:03.950 --> 48:05.810
I love my husband.

48:05.810 --> 48:08.430
Well, he's done a lot
for me professionally,

48:08.430 --> 48:10.700
and there's a part of me
that's very protective

48:10.700 --> 48:12.300
of our marriage because of that.

48:13.165 --> 48:14.860
(camera snaps)

48:14.860 --> 48:16.513
So the question becomes:

48:17.400 --> 48:18.743
Do I love him for him,

48:19.860 --> 48:22.445
or do I love him because of
what he's done for my career?

48:22.445 --> 48:24.753
(camera snaps)
The lines get blurred.

48:27.799 --> 48:30.382
(camera snaps)

48:32.140 --> 48:34.940
You see that picture hanging over there?

48:34.940 --> 48:37.280
I love that photograph.

48:37.280 --> 48:40.740
It sort of embodies the very struggle

48:40.740 --> 48:42.435
that I'm talking about.

48:42.435 --> 48:44.140
(camera snaps)
Who are they?

48:44.140 --> 48:48.193
- These two women I shot many years ago.

48:50.340 --> 48:51.874
They were slaves to their marriages.

48:51.874 --> 48:54.840
(camera snaps)

48:54.840 --> 48:57.460
I've never seen a connection
quite like theirs.

48:57.460 --> 48:59.091
- Did they end up together?

48:59.091 --> 49:01.674
(camera snaps)

49:02.880 --> 49:04.310
- No.

49:04.310 --> 49:05.163
Of course not.

49:06.310 --> 49:08.655
They stayed with their husbands.

49:08.655 --> 49:11.238
(camera snaps)

49:13.280 --> 49:14.363
- That's tragic.

49:15.270 --> 49:17.843
- Not every love story
ends like a romance novel.

49:20.415 --> 49:22.357
(camera snaps)

49:22.357 --> 49:23.960
(camera snaps)

49:23.960 --> 49:26.243
- Jules is very vulnerable, Scarlet.

49:29.270 --> 49:30.103
- I know that.

49:31.430 --> 49:32.930
- She wants the romance novel.

49:36.085 --> 49:37.913
- Well, then she's reading the wrong book.

49:40.303 --> 49:42.886
(camera snaps)

49:53.040 --> 49:54.560
- Hey, is everything okay?

49:54.560 --> 49:56.050
- When I call, you pick up.

49:56.050 --> 49:58.040
That's how this works.

49:58.040 --> 49:59.587
- I'm sorry, I was doing
this thing for Jules and--

49:59.587 --> 50:02.730
- You can't just disappear
whenever you want.

50:02.730 --> 50:04.550
- I'm sorry. I didn't.

50:04.550 --> 50:07.540
- [Elliott] This is not a
typical relationship, Ashley.

50:07.540 --> 50:08.373
- I know.

50:08.373 --> 50:09.710
- And if you're not cut out for it--

50:09.710 --> 50:10.730
- No, no, I am.

50:10.730 --> 50:14.220
I'm still just trying to
figure everything out.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.073
- It's simple.

50:16.210 --> 50:17.483
Just give up control.

50:19.380 --> 50:21.424
- I know. I'm trying.

50:21.424 --> 50:23.507
- [Elliott] You'll learn.

50:25.440 --> 50:27.103
- Are you mad at me?

50:27.103 --> 50:28.080
- No.

50:28.080 --> 50:28.913
- Okay, good.

50:29.915 --> 50:31.515
- But I will have to punish you.

50:33.590 --> 50:34.790
- What's the punishment?

50:36.290 --> 50:37.950
- You want me to what?!

50:37.950 --> 50:39.860
- Spank me, five times.

50:39.860 --> 50:41.140
- Why?

50:41.140 --> 50:44.330
- It's this whole new age
psychological practice

50:44.330 --> 50:47.870
where adults benefit
from childhood punishment

50:47.870 --> 50:50.270
as a way of changing their behaviors.

50:50.270 --> 50:51.870
You should really read about it.

50:51.870 --> 50:52.734
- I don't need to read about it.

50:52.734 --> 50:53.567
I'll do whatever you want.

50:53.567 --> 50:54.400
Just give me your ass,

50:54.400 --> 50:56.183
and tell me what happened with Scarlet.

50:59.370 --> 51:00.203
Start talking.

51:01.073 --> 51:01.906
- Okay.

51:01.906 --> 51:04.470
So she cares about you a lot.

51:04.470 --> 51:05.453
- I know that.

51:06.410 --> 51:09.440
- But I think she's torn.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.453
- Really? How?

51:11.430 --> 51:12.263
- Spank me.

51:13.202 --> 51:14.540
(soft slap)

51:14.540 --> 51:15.510
One.

51:15.510 --> 51:17.980
She's really committed to her career.

51:17.980 --> 51:20.260
I mean, she loves her job.

51:20.260 --> 51:22.060
- This isn't news.

51:22.060 --> 51:26.850
- But it's, like, her top
priority, even more than love.

51:26.850 --> 51:29.090
- She says she loves her job more than me.

51:29.090 --> 51:30.572
- No, but--

51:30.572 --> 51:31.405
(loud slap)

51:31.405 --> 51:33.050
Two.

51:33.050 --> 51:34.950
Love does come at a price.

51:34.950 --> 51:36.350
- What does that mean?

51:36.350 --> 51:39.130
- I don't know, it's just, she--

51:39.130 --> 51:40.390
- Tell me!
(loud slap)

51:40.390 --> 51:41.500
- Three.

51:41.500 --> 51:43.150
She doesn't want to sacrifice her marriage

51:43.150 --> 51:45.510
for what it's done for her career.

51:45.510 --> 51:47.470
- What it's done for her career?

51:47.470 --> 51:49.325
Tomas has done shit for her career.

51:49.325 --> 51:50.158
(loud slap)
- Four.

51:50.158 --> 51:52.122
- All he does is hang
around like a fucking leech!

51:52.122 --> 51:52.955
(loud slap)
- Five.

51:52.955 --> 51:54.576
- Sucking every ounce
of happiness from her.

51:54.576 --> 51:55.409
(loud slap)
- Six.

51:55.409 --> 51:56.242
- Taking her money.
(loud slap)

51:56.242 --> 51:57.210
- Seven.
- Taking credit

51:57.210 --> 51:58.530
for all of her talent!

51:58.530 --> 51:59.363
(loud slap)
- Eight.

51:59.363 --> 52:00.829
- As if she can't be
successful without him!

52:00.829 --> 52:02.620
(loud slap)
- Nine, Jules, stop!

52:02.620 --> 52:05.480
- He's a lying, manipulative prick

52:05.480 --> 52:07.510
who does everything he
can to keep her down!

52:07.510 --> 52:08.988
I fucking hate him!

52:08.988 --> 52:10.410
(loud slap)

52:10.410 --> 52:12.893
- You were supposed to stop at five.

52:13.890 --> 52:17.940
- Sorry, but your ass
is here and I'm pissed!

52:17.940 --> 52:19.470
- [Ashley] So did you get the picture?

52:19.470 --> 52:21.520
- [Elliott] Red and swollen, my favorite.

52:23.300 --> 52:25.310
I wish that had been my hand.

52:25.310 --> 52:28.563
- Yeah, well, she went crazy
and spanked me, like, 10 times.

52:29.750 --> 52:31.780
- I told you only five.

52:31.780 --> 52:33.030
- Well, what was I supposed to do?

52:33.030 --> 52:34.850
She just wouldn't stop.

52:34.850 --> 52:36.183
- Follow my instructions.

52:37.350 --> 52:39.053
You can't disobey me, Ashley.

52:40.220 --> 52:41.940
I'm going to have to punish you again.

52:41.940 --> 52:43.270
- Are you serious?

52:43.270 --> 52:44.103
- [Elliott] Yes.

52:45.270 --> 52:48.020
- Well, then you're just
gonna have to do it in person.

52:48.970 --> 52:51.180
- Are you giving me orders?

52:51.180 --> 52:52.013
- Maybe.

52:54.490 --> 52:57.340
- I'm gonna have to keep you
on a tight leash, aren't I?

52:57.340 --> 52:58.420
- Probably.

52:58.420 --> 53:00.220
- I'll text you my address in a bit.

53:01.070 --> 53:01.903
9:00 p.m.

53:02.770 --> 53:03.670
Not a minute late.

53:10.894 --> 53:13.644
(ethereal music)

53:23.422 --> 53:25.440
What the hell are you doing here?!

53:25.440 --> 53:27.360
- Oh, I'm not leaving until we fuck.

53:27.360 --> 53:29.650
- You can't show up at my house like this!

53:29.650 --> 53:31.510
- You never had a problem with it before.

53:31.510 --> 53:33.000
- Well, yeah, I'm drawing the line now.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.023
- Well, that's no fun.

53:36.180 --> 53:37.580
- Where'd you park the car?

53:37.580 --> 53:38.413
- The garage.

53:41.170 --> 53:42.270
What's wrong with you?

53:43.575 --> 53:45.112
(Dylan gasps)

53:45.112 --> 53:46.950
- I don't want you here.

53:46.950 --> 53:50.230
- Well, too bad.
(handcuffs clicking)

53:50.230 --> 53:51.878
- Very funny, very funny.

53:51.878 --> 53:53.493
(Dylan chuckles)
Where's the key?

53:54.770 --> 53:56.800
Where's the fucking key, Dylan?

53:56.800 --> 53:58.520
- Inside of me.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.355
- You are unbelievable!

54:00.355 --> 54:01.188
- You love it.

54:01.188 --> 54:02.640
(laughs)

54:02.640 --> 54:04.060
- Uncuff me.

54:04.060 --> 54:05.805
- You know where the key is.

54:05.805 --> 54:07.260
Uncuff yourself.

54:07.260 --> 54:08.393
- I mean it, now.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.813
Goddammit, Dylan!

54:11.813 --> 54:13.813
(moans)

54:14.673 --> 54:16.923
(chuckles)

54:18.589 --> 54:20.532
Give me your other hand.

54:20.532 --> 54:22.115
(key jingles)

54:22.115 --> 54:25.198
(handcuffs clicking)

54:31.640 --> 54:34.363
When I get back, you won't
be able to sit for a week.

54:36.355 --> 54:38.580
- Ooh, I must be in trouble.

54:44.747 --> 54:45.580
- Hello.

54:59.299 --> 55:02.299
(upbeat rock music)

55:29.770 --> 55:31.230
- Hi.

55:31.230 --> 55:32.063
- Hi.

55:34.020 --> 55:36.070
- The blindfold stays on the entire time.

55:37.470 --> 55:39.143
- But I want to see your face.

55:40.520 --> 55:42.320
- This is your punishment, remember?

55:43.420 --> 55:45.023
- Well, when do I get a reward?

55:49.270 --> 55:51.483
- When you start doing exactly as I say.

55:58.853 --> 56:01.020
(panting)

56:08.021 --> 56:09.560
- Hi.

56:09.560 --> 56:10.393
- Hi.

56:12.170 --> 56:17.170
- That might have been my
most favorite punishment yet.

56:20.080 --> 56:21.581
- Well, I went a little easy on you

56:21.581 --> 56:23.893
given you haven't done this before.

56:25.682 --> 56:26.515
- Mm.

56:30.640 --> 56:33.307
(elegant music)

56:46.000 --> 56:46.833
Hi.

56:48.040 --> 56:48.873
- Right on time.

56:50.310 --> 56:53.174
Come in.

56:53.174 --> 56:56.380
Welcome to my home away from home.

56:58.264 --> 56:59.264
Look around.

57:06.731 --> 57:07.564
- Wow.

57:20.040 --> 57:22.828
I've never seen anything like this before.

57:22.828 --> 57:24.060
- You nervous?

57:24.060 --> 57:24.893
- No.

57:26.988 --> 57:28.288
I'm just taking it all in.

57:38.340 --> 57:39.253
Saran wrap?

57:41.420 --> 57:45.540
- It's for sensory deprivation,
specifically mummification.

57:47.436 --> 57:48.769
- Mummification?

57:50.940 --> 57:52.493
You wrap someone in this?

57:53.740 --> 57:54.880
- Yes.

57:54.880 --> 57:57.210
- As what, some sort of punishment?

57:57.210 --> 57:58.043
- Sometimes.

58:00.580 --> 58:02.693
I like to do it as an exercise in trust.

58:05.320 --> 58:07.073
- Okay, now I'm nervous.

58:09.280 --> 58:10.113
- Why?

58:12.530 --> 58:14.780
- We're not gonna do that, are we?

58:14.780 --> 58:16.780
Because I'm really claustrophobic

58:16.780 --> 58:18.970
and I don't think I could...

58:20.030 --> 58:24.853
- My goal is to open you
up, not to shut you down.

58:26.830 --> 58:31.200
You will never have to do
anything you don't want to do.

58:37.660 --> 58:39.460
So how do you feel about restraints?

58:53.920 --> 58:56.673
If you feel uncomfortable
in any way, just tell me.

58:58.720 --> 58:59.553
- Okay.

59:02.310 --> 59:04.580
- We should establish a safe word

59:04.580 --> 59:06.610
before things get too intense.

59:07.970 --> 59:09.303
- It's already intense.

59:11.920 --> 59:14.243
- We haven't even touched
the tip of the iceberg.

59:19.775 --> 59:23.025
(tassel whip cracking)

59:24.875 --> 59:25.967
(groans)

59:25.967 --> 59:29.800
(tassel whip cracks)
- Cactus.

59:31.740 --> 59:32.573
Our safe word.

59:33.650 --> 59:34.483
Cactus.

59:36.390 --> 59:37.223
- Okay.

59:39.410 --> 59:40.243
Why cactus?

59:42.930 --> 59:44.723
- Because it's beautiful and--

59:46.506 --> 59:48.979
- You think cactus are beautiful?

59:48.979 --> 59:49.812
- Yes.

59:52.124 --> 59:57.124
It's beautiful and it has the
ability to cause great pain.

01:00:01.967 --> 01:00:05.323
I think that's very fitting
for this scenario, no?

01:00:08.977 --> 01:00:09.810
What?

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.093
- Okay, cactus it is.

01:00:14.091 --> 01:00:15.683
But don't be afraid of pain.

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:19.447
Pain can be fun sometimes.

01:00:24.258 --> 01:00:27.341
(tassel whip cracks)

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:36.480
(tassel whip cracks)

01:00:40.567 --> 01:00:41.484
Impressive.

01:00:42.703 --> 01:00:44.560
(sighs)

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.560
- Well, I aim to please.

01:00:49.161 --> 01:00:49.994
- You do.

01:01:08.262 --> 01:01:11.012
(Ashley moaning)

01:01:21.324 --> 01:01:23.870
- What are you doing?

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:25.543
- [Elliott] I'm heading out for a bit.

01:01:27.531 --> 01:01:28.581
- Are you kidding me?

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.257
- What's the fun of
giving you what you want

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.603
exactly when you want it?

01:01:43.483 --> 01:01:45.650
(panting)

01:01:51.944 --> 01:01:54.611
(playful music)

01:02:04.434 --> 01:02:07.190
- So, what would you guys say

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:11.040
if I told you I was going to
start practicing polyfidelity?

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.540
- Is that a religion?

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.420
- No, it's like polyamory,
but with monogamy.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.253
- Wait.

01:02:16.253 --> 01:02:18.250
What's polyamory?

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:20.110
- Okay, so it's like this:

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:21.690
I'm in love with a married woman,

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:22.910
and for the last eight months,

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:24.730
I've been nagging her to
define her relationship

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:28.310
by conventional standards when
I fucking hate convention.

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:29.810
- Convention's overrated.

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:30.690
- Exactly!

01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:33.150
Vanilla relationships equal vanilla sex.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:35.340
You probably know this
better than anybody.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.573
- Well, I'm working on changing that.

01:02:37.573 --> 01:02:40.130
- With who?
- Dude, don't get sidetracked.

01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:41.600
- It's nobody you know.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.013
- Wait, so there is somebody?

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.423
- No, there's nobody.

01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:49.810
I just mean I'm opening
myself up a bit more.

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:51.820
- Oh, like with the spanking thing.

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.720
- Jules.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.203
- She made me spank her.

01:02:55.103 --> 01:02:57.003
- How unconventional.

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.440
- But getting back to
the whole Scarlet thing,

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.270
what I've come to realize
over the last few days

01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:05.750
is that there is a way for
our relationship to work,

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.630
and that way is polyfidelity.

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:09.160
- You still haven't told us what that is.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.173
- Why don't you just find
someone who's actually available?

01:03:13.365 --> 01:03:16.290
- That's the thing, Scarlet is available.

01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:18.980
- Yeah, to her husband, not you.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:22.160
- Yeah, but she can be available to me

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.400
when I come to accept and embrace

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.800
the choices that she's made.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.469
- And by "accept the choices,"
you mean accept the marriage.

01:03:30.469 --> 01:03:32.058
- Yeah.

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.730
And by embrace the choices,

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:38.290
I mean I'm going to start
fucking both of them!

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:47.755
(gleeful music)

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.883
- So what's his name?

01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:59.138
- What?

01:03:59.138 --> 01:04:01.070
- You've been smiling
since you walked in today,

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:03.870
and I know it's not from
the Kona beans, so...

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:05.050
- Maybe I'm just happy.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.330
Why does it have to be about a guy?

01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:09.243
- Delivery for Ashley Pendleton.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.353
- Thank you.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.690
- Pain is beautiful

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:20.540
and so are you.
- Hey, give me that!

01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:24.250
- You know, no self-respecting guy

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:25.830
would ever say that to a chick.

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:27.100
- Yeah, well, no self-respecting guy

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.903
would ever call a woman a chick.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.033
What?

01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:36.730
- I just think it's a
little too early in the game

01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:38.580
to be sending each other gifts.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.680
- It's not a game.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.310
- Oh, sweetie, it's a game.

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:43.830
He's playing you.

01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:45.430
Hard.

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:46.630
- Don't call me sweetie.

01:04:51.572 --> 01:04:52.810
- You know, you really need to start

01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:55.300
cleaning up after your whores.

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.020
- Where'd you find those?

01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:58.563
- On the floor of the cellar.

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:01.270
- [Elliott] Give them to me.

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:02.533
- Whose are they?
- Now.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.090
- So, this is why you've been acting

01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:14.310
like such a little bitch lately?

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.320
You've been carrying on
with a secret affair?

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.990
- What I do outside of our arrangement

01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:20.460
is none of your business.

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:23.883
- Who you fuck around
with is our arrangement.

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:25.933
What's her name?

01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:28.233
Tell me.

01:05:28.233 --> 01:05:29.400
(sighs)

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.260
- God, you're exhausting.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.310
- Why, 'cause I call you on your bullshit?

01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.503
- No, because you never stop pushing!

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.710
- Strong women are
intimidating, aren't they?

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.380
- You're not strong.

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.383
You're pathetic.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.850
You want everyone to think
that you're this tough girl,

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:50.148
but you reek of desperation.

01:05:50.148 --> 01:05:51.090
- Do I?

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:54.450
- You want to know why I'm
having this secret affair?

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.850
It's because I need someone
to hold my interest.

01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:00.130
You bore me.

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:02.810
My eyes glaze over whenever you talk

01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:04.870
because I know what you're going to say

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:06.743
before you even open your mouth.

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:10.373
I pay you, remember?

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:12.803
To find me women,

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:17.100
to do my errands,

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.793
to do the dirty work.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.520
But you're not worth the hassle anymore.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.593
So, leave me the keys and
get the fuck outta here.

01:06:36.889 --> 01:06:37.722
- Mail.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.010
- What made you change your mind?

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:05.610
- [Ashley] What you said.

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:07.170
- About?

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:09.003
- I need you to know that I'm yours.

01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:12.210
- Ashley, we've--

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:14.453
- You've been so patient with me.

01:07:16.590 --> 01:07:20.563
I want to prove how committed
I am to this and to you.

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:23.080
- You already have.

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:24.883
- Fine.

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.160
Then let me prove it to myself.

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.597
- Take off your clothes.

01:08:03.842 --> 01:08:06.032
- I'll still be able to talk, right?

01:08:06.032 --> 01:08:06.865
- Of course.

01:08:08.381 --> 01:08:11.687
- And you're not gonna
blindfold me again, are you?

01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:15.620
- You took the blindfold, remember?

01:08:17.029 --> 01:08:17.863
- Right.

01:08:20.113 --> 01:08:23.010
- I want you to keep your eyes
locked on me the whole time.

01:08:24.054 --> 01:08:24.886
- Okay.

01:08:32.104 --> 01:08:35.805
- [Elliott] And if you feel
afraid at any moment, you can--

01:08:35.805 --> 01:08:37.388
- Use my safe word?

01:08:44.885 --> 01:08:45.752
(sobs)

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:47.109
- Fuck!

01:08:47.109 --> 01:08:49.277
(sobbing)

01:09:14.634 --> 01:09:16.562
(sighs)

01:09:16.562 --> 01:09:17.395
Okay.

01:09:22.562 --> 01:09:23.892
- [Elliot] You ready for this?

01:09:23.892 --> 01:09:25.444
- I don't think--
(touchpad clicking)

01:09:25.444 --> 01:09:28.111
(woman moaning)

01:09:30.658 --> 01:09:34.826
- It's gonna get really
warm in just a little bit.

01:09:37.283 --> 01:09:39.270
Relax your mind.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:40.103
Stay present.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.252
Don't let your imagination
tell you how to feel.

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:46.703
Just feel.

01:09:47.703 --> 01:09:48.536
- Fuck.

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.090
She was a fun girl.

01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:04.630
The nondisclosure was a nice touch.

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:05.463
Jackpot.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.430
- He had full possession over me,

01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:21.730
and I had become a
slave to his every need.

01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:23.823
I lived to be dominated by him.

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.603
Are your books based on real life?

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.243
- Sometimes.

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:36.790
- Do you think you'll ever write about us?

01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:39.770
- I'd rather keep that sacred.

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:45.850
- This is my favorite part.

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:48.810
I crave those moments
where he would look at me,

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:51.973
down on my knees, and
know he'd put me there,

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.920
taught me that, enslaved me to him.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.200
- [Dylan] Nondisclosure was a nice touch.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.343
- [Elliott] Sells the story.

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.540
- I was an insatiable demon

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:05.110
willing to stop at nothing to please him.

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.990
We had reached the point of no return,

01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:09.233
and now all I wanted was--
- I have to go.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.193
- Why?

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:15.270
- Something came up at work.

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.103
A deadline.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.800
- [Dylan] I bet you didn't
see that one coming, did you?

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.570
- Stop being such a cunt.

01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:42.800
- You better be careful.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.210
I'll send it to her.

01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:45.710
I'm sure she would love to know

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:49.000
what a manipulative little
prick you really are.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.010
- What do you want?

01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:51.843
- Sit down.

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:02.684
(sighs)

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.350
(Elliott groans)

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.520
Why did you go after her
when I told you not to?

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.703
- Because I don't take orders from anyone.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.233
(Elliott groans)

01:12:20.233 --> 01:12:22.163
- You do now.

01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:28.270
Give me one good reason

01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:31.230
why I shouldn't just tell her everything?

01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.130
- Because she doesn't deserve it.

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:35.100
- Neither did any of the other girls.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.870
- Yeah, well, she's different.

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:38.847
- How?!

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.380
How is she so different, Elliott?!

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.243
- She just is.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.790
- You don't want to talk, fine.

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:52.853
I'll send the email.

01:12:53.796 --> 01:12:54.750
- Don't you dare.

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:57.163
- Then start talking.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.633
- I didn't expect it to go this far.

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:05.100
I was going to end it after
the first night, but--

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:05.933
- But what?!

01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:09.193
- I got caught up in it, okay?

01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:11.790
She was sweet and--

01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:15.430
- She was a fangirl sucked in by a name.

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:16.383
- That's not true.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.210
She could be anybody else,

01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:22.280
and I wouldn't care

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.010
what you would tell them about me, but--

01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.843
- But what?!

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:38.070
You're in love with her.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.483
- What do you want?

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.363
I'll do anything.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.087
I'll give you money.

01:13:48.087 --> 01:13:50.316
- I don't want your money.

01:13:50.316 --> 01:13:51.863
- Then what do you want?

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:57.123
- Her.

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:00.963
- What?

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.023
- Loan her to me.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.550
Eight o'clock tomorrow
night, bring her here.

01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:14.370
She doesn't show or leaves
early, I tell her everything.

01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:16.983
- You're fucking nuts.

01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:19.760
- [Dylan] And you're terrified.

01:14:24.832 --> 01:14:27.415
(gentle music)

01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:39.610
- It's funny you bring this up.

01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:42.040
Tomorrow night, I'm going to lend you out

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.083
to another dominant.

01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:47.450
It might give you the
perspective that you need.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.040
- What do you mean "loan me out"?

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:51.940
- Let me finish.

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.720
- No.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.900
No.

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.760
I don't want to be with anybody else.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.560
- Me having you submit
to someone else is--

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.480
- Is a no.

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.250
- Ashley--
- No!

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:02.083
No other people.

01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:03.340
Absolutely not.

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.603
- Listen to me!

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.440
I need you to explore this world

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.780
as much as you possibly can.

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.783
- I am.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.673
- How can you if you're
not willing to take risks?

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:19.053
I need to know what you
do and do not want--

01:15:19.053 --> 01:15:20.460
- I don't want this.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:22.773
- Well, I need you to want this.

01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:26.363
It's not all about you.

01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:30.893
It's about me and what I need
for this relationship to work.

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.183
Trust is an ongoing thing, Ashley.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.633
- Okay.

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:46.573
- Okay?

01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:51.029
- I'll do it.

01:15:51.029 --> 01:15:53.779
(dramatic music)

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.850
- Couldn't convince
her to come, could you?

01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:05.700
- She'll be here.

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.877
I'm not sure why I need to be here.

01:16:16.263 --> 01:16:18.930
(ominous music)

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:52.973
- You're late.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.220
- What are you doing here?

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.530
- Elliott didn't tell you?

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:00.423
- He didn't tell me it would be you.

01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:04.720
- Don't look so scared.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.553
- I'm not.

01:17:06.734 --> 01:17:08.370
I just...

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:10.560
I don't understand what's going on.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.350
- I'm training to be a dominant,

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:15.100
and since I don't have my own submissive,

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:18.143
Elliott was kind enough
to let me borrow you.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.163
Stand here.

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:26.890
Are you deaf?

01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:28.043
Stand here.

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:41.210
When I give you an instruction,

01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:43.650
you follow it the first time I ask.

01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:44.483
Understood?

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.153
- Yes.

01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:51.283
- Tonight, I'm not your roommate.

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.513
I'm the bitch you answer to.

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:58.533
Clear?

01:18:00.285 --> 01:18:01.495
- Clear.

01:18:01.495 --> 01:18:04.078
(gentle music)

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.720
- Why didn't you tell me it was her?

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.840
- Would it have mattered?

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.673
- It might have.

01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:20.185
What exactly is your
relationship with her?

01:18:20.185 --> 01:18:21.653
- There is no relationship.

01:18:26.799 --> 01:18:29.132
- Have you had sex with her?

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:33.593
- Yes.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.143
- Are you still?

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:39.922
- No.

01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:42.663
Of course not.

01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:46.433
She worked for me.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.333
I hired her to find me submissives,

01:18:52.449 --> 01:18:56.610
and, occasionally, I would
allow her to join in on the fun.

01:18:57.690 --> 01:18:59.767
But I tired of her very quickly.

01:19:06.435 --> 01:19:11.350
- I don't want to do anything
like that ever again.

01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:12.350
- You won't have to.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.063
I know you're mine now.

01:19:19.396 --> 01:19:21.146
- I was always yours.

01:19:35.530 --> 01:19:36.603
What are you doing?

01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:38.533
- Moving out.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:40.593
- Why?

01:19:43.561 --> 01:19:44.394
(sighs)

01:19:44.394 --> 01:19:47.520
- I only planned on being
here for a few months.

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.560
It's been almost a year.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.573
Time to move on.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:56.190
- This doesn't have anything
to do with last night, does it?

01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:57.090
- Why would it be?

01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:58.973
- I don't know.

01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:02.940
- Look, you're the one that
should be all fucked up,

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.670
knowing your boyfriend pimped
you out to somebody else.

01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:06.730
- He didn't.

01:20:06.730 --> 01:20:07.563
- Okay.

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:12.900
- You know, no offense, Dylan,

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.313
but you know nothing
about our relationship.

01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:21.293
- No, but I know quite
a bit about Elliott.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.400
- Not as much as I do.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.440
- You've known him for a month.

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:29.870
I've spent nearly every day
with him for the past year.

01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:32.913
- Running his errands
and getting him women.

01:20:32.913 --> 01:20:35.010
- Is that all he told you?

01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:36.390
- I know you two slept together,

01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:38.560
if that's what you're smiling about.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:43.150
And I also know you got needy
and that's why he ended it.

01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:44.170
- I wasn't needy.

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:45.720
I was frustrated.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.170
- Because he didn't love you.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:51.640
He told me everything, Dylan.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.493
- Even about Nolan Keats?

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:55.273
- Yes.

01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:59.053
I've known he's Nolan
since the day I met him.

01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:03.940
- Let me show you something.

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.500
- I have to go to work.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.363
- I'll be quick.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.510
- What is this?

01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:18.643
- Just wait.

01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:26.200
Just watch.
- That was delightful.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.930
- She was a fun girl.

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.860
The nondisclosure was a nice touch.

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.590
- [Elliott] Sells the story.

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:32.700
- [Dylan] You're good, I'll give you that.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:33.533
- I know.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:35.880
- Hey, is Nolan Keats

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.227
aware you're using that name to get women?

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.797
- Nolan is well-aware.

01:21:39.797 --> 01:21:42.214
(both laugh)

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.203
- I'm guessing by your reaction
he never told you that.

01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:51.710
I thought you knew everything.

01:21:54.353 --> 01:21:55.340
- No.

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.960
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.980
He's Nolan Keats!

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:01.030
He told me he was, plus he
gave me a copy of his new book

01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.863
that's coming out in the fall.

01:22:01.863 --> 01:22:02.960
How would he have that?!

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.880
- Elliott is Nolan Keats's
copy editor, Ashley.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.823
He's been working with
Nolan's publisher for years.

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:14.800
Nolan Keats introduced me to Elliott

01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:17.860
and doesn't even live in Ivy.

01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:19.560
Nolan doesn't do interviews

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.193
and would never talk to a little fangirl.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.493
Elliott is not Nolan Keats.

01:22:30.757 --> 01:22:33.424
(phone ringing)

01:22:57.107 --> 01:22:58.130
(sighs)

01:22:58.130 --> 01:23:00.290
- [Woman] You've reached the
voicemail of Nolan Keats.

01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:01.453
Please leave a message.

01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:08.770
- [Dylan] Hey, Elliott, it's Dylan.

01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.120
Listen, I just wanted
to call really quickly

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.080
and thank you for last night.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.500
I know now that I'm definitely not cut out

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.140
to be a submissive.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:21.700
But Ashley, on the other
hand, she most certainly is.

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:24.840
Unfortunately, I don't think
that after this morning

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.110
she'll be submitting to you anymore

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:30.920
because I told her everything.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.090
I guess, in a weird way,

01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:35.340
keeping the little Nolan
Keats thing a secret

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:38.000
felt almost like an act of submission,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.610
and as you know quite well,
I'm really bad at submission.

01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:44.670
I make a far better dominant.

01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:47.120
So, I showed her the video

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.470
and explained to her who
Nolan Keats really is,

01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:52.800
not because it was the right thing to do,

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.830
but because it was the
ultimate act of domination,

01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:59.593
not just over her, but over you.

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:06.143
- I did it!

01:24:06.143 --> 01:24:07.726
I fucking ended it!

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:11.443
Where the fuck is everybody?

01:24:12.471 --> 01:24:13.304
Dylan!

01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:16.463
Dylan!

01:24:17.551 --> 01:24:18.593
Holy shit.

01:24:23.668 --> 01:24:25.690
- There you go. That'll be $10.

01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:26.733
- Brewed coffee.

01:24:27.901 --> 01:24:28.909
10 bucks.

01:24:28.909 --> 01:24:29.747
Man.

01:24:29.747 --> 01:24:30.580
- Is Dylan here?

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:32.050
- Excuse me!
- No, nobody's here.

01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:33.580
Dylan's not here. Nobody's here.

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:34.510
- Where's Ashley?

01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:36.590
- Ashley called out
sick, Dylan's a no-show,

01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:39.490
and I have no employees here
today, so please get in line.

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:41.170
- Wait.

01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:42.620
Does this mean you're hiring?

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.013
- Ashley.

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.350
- What are you doing here?

01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:56.060
- Please.
- Get out of here.

01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:57.140
- Let me explain.

01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.253
- Don't come near me.

01:24:59.450 --> 01:25:02.230
- Please.
- You're a sociopath!

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.030
- Just--
- I don't want to listen

01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:05.810
to anything you have to say!

01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:08.110
- Just let me tell you my side.

01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:09.310
Please!

01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:10.630
- You played me!

01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:12.250
- No.
- Just like you played

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:13.520
everyone else!

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.570
- You were different.

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.843
- Why?

01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:20.800
Because you didn't videotape us fucking?!

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.353
- Ashley--
- You should be locked up.

01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:25.400
- I was gonna tell you.

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:28.380
- When?

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:30.250
- I was waiting for the right time, okay?

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:33.340
- Oh, yeah, 'cause there is
no right time to tell someone

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.170
that their entire relationship
is based on a lie!

01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:37.010
- You know that's not true.

01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:38.320
- How is that not true?!

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.523
You've been lying to me since day one!

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.227
You sent me his fucking book as proof!

01:25:44.227 --> 01:25:46.609
- And you ate up every word of it.

01:25:46.609 --> 01:25:48.050
- Excuse me?

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:50.020
- You wanted to believe I was him!

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.357
- I had no reason not to!

01:25:51.357 --> 01:25:52.610
- You just loved the fact

01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:54.402
that you were dating some sex writer.

01:25:54.402 --> 01:25:56.735
(loud slap)

01:26:00.737 --> 01:26:01.570
Ashley.

01:26:09.506 --> 01:26:12.673
(gentle guitar music)

01:27:11.491 --> 01:27:13.741
(knocking)

01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.833
- Hi, Nolan.

01:27:20.771 --> 01:27:23.354
(upbeat music)

01:28:05.342 --> 01:28:08.092
(dramatic music)
