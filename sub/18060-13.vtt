That's it, <i>Maman.</i>

00:10.469 --> 00:11.470
That's it.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.056
I'm sorry, <i>Maman.</i>
Forgive me.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.309
To defeat Jafar...

00:17.392 --> 00:20.103
(BOTH) We need to return the stolen water
to the Well of Wonders.

JAFAR: <i>What if I told you there was a way</i>

00:23.649 --> 00:25.150
to bring back Anastasia?

00:25.234 --> 00:27.653
Cyrus says you hold
great importance to Jafar,

00:27.736 --> 00:29.363
and if I freed you, you'd help us.

Please, can you help him?

01:11.154 --> 01:13.490
-Oh, my son.
-CYRUS: Of course she can.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.952
Amara and I are now the two
most powerful sorcerers in the world.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.580
There's just one problem.

-AMARA: Let's go.
-The way to show true power

01:32.217 --> 01:33.510
is with mercy.

Like the mercy you showed the boy

01:36.054 --> 01:38.182
who came to you
looking for his father's love?

01:40.517 --> 01:42.853
Love was not something

01:42.936 --> 01:45.272
that I could just give to you, Jafar.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.482
You had to earn it.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.070
I think I've grown tired
of this argument, Father.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.657
Lucky for me,
I won't be having it ever again.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.286
I'm no longer bound
by the laws of magic.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.414
I can have whatever I want.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.916
And what is that?

02:04.541 --> 02:08.045
The same thing I've been wanting
since I was 10 years old.

all that I've wanted from you.

-Nonsense.

you didn't return my staff as we agreed,

-It is.

to the well of wonders.

10:23.207 --> 10:26.293

I'll take the Rabbit,

rescue the Knave and your brothers.

30:16.149 --> 30:18.694
I told you it wasn't me
who is going to defeat you.

30:19.444 --> 30:21.655
Because you didn't steal
that water from me.

30:22.614 --> 30:24.658
