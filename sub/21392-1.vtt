11:51.001 --> 11:52.207
and all?

11:52.208 --> 11:54.457
Oh, I don't think I'll forget.

11:54.458 --> 11:55.896
Must be nice being rewarded

11:55.897 --> 11:57.333
for somebody else's hard work.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.667
Is that how you really want

12:00.668 --> 12:02.124
this to be this summer?

12:02.125 --> 12:03.290
I'm sorry.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.479
I've been working really hard

12:04.480 --> 12:05.665
on being nice this year.

12:05.666 --> 12:07.208
- Back at college, they make us
- live with these...

12:07.211 --> 12:09.124
Low-income scholarship students.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.332
Ugh.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.165
Stacy.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.791
I'm very excited to be

12:13.792 --> 12:15.415
working with you this summer...

12:15.416 --> 12:16.708
and I hope we can be better

12:16.709 --> 12:18.000
friends.

12:19.625 --> 12:20.833
That sounded rehearsed,

12:20.834 --> 12:22.041
but I will take it.

12:24.166 --> 12:28.249
Hello, counselors!

12:28.250 --> 12:30.457
So happy to see you two!

12:30.458 --> 12:32.458
- You're gonna make such great
- counselors.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.874
Thank you, Miss Jessica.

12:33.875 --> 12:34.957
No, no, no.

12:34.958 --> 12:37.062
You're staff now.

12:37.063 --> 12:39.165
I'm just plain Jessica.

12:39.166 --> 12:41.999
Okay, Just Plain Jessica.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.249
Same old Lisa.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.583
- Come on, we better get you
- settled...

12:45.586 --> 12:47.040
Into the counselors' cabin!

12:47.041 --> 12:48.146
We have just enough time

12:48.147 --> 12:49.249
for you to unpack...

12:49.250 --> 12:51.207
before the staff meeting.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.437
It's gonna be such

12:52.438 --> 12:53.666
a great summer!

13:00.541 --> 13:02.812
And remember, ladies, Mrs. D

13:02.813 --> 13:05.082
built Black River as a safe...

13:05.083 --> 13:07.292
and supportive place for young

13:07.293 --> 13:09.499
girls from all walks of life.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.229
All I ask is that you honor her

13:11.230 --> 13:12.957
memory by treating each...

13:12.958 --> 13:14.312
and every girl that walks

13:14.313 --> 13:15.665
through that gate...

13:15.666 --> 13:17.021
with the kindness and respect

13:17.022 --> 13:18.374
they deserve.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.479
And give them a summer

13:19.480 --> 13:20.582
that they'll never forget.

13:20.583 --> 13:21.707
Can you do that?

13:21.708 --> 13:23.332
Yes.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.249
I can't hear you.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.624
Yes!

13:26.625 --> 13:29.957
All right, then. Any questions?

13:29.958 --> 13:32.542
No offense, but why is

13:32.543 --> 13:35.125
everything so dirty and icky?

13:37.583 --> 13:38.896
That brings us to the

13:38.897 --> 13:40.207
last item on our agenda...

13:40.208 --> 13:42.146
which is everything's so dirty

13:42.147 --> 13:44.082
and icky...

13:44.083 --> 13:45.896
because you've always been a

13:45.897 --> 13:47.707
camper, and didn't know that...

13:47.708 --> 13:49.146
the counselors spend a week

13:49.147 --> 13:50.582
before the ranch opens...

13:50.583 --> 13:52.291
cleaning everything.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.750
Can't you, like, hire

13:54.751 --> 13:56.165
someone to do that?

13:56.166 --> 13:57.958
Pretty sure I already

13:57.959 --> 13:59.750
have, you all.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.166
- Don't worry, guys. It will be
- over before we know it.

14:04.169 --> 14:05.415
Right, Miss Jessica?

14:05.416 --> 14:07.499
Absolutely. You'll see.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.271
Oh, and remember, call me

14:09.272 --> 14:11.040
Jessica.

14:11.041 --> 14:13.040
I'm not your counselor.

14:13.041 --> 14:14.541
And when the campers get here,

14:14.542 --> 14:16.040
you'll become Miss Lisa.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.458
It's got a certain, nice ring

14:17.459 --> 14:18.874
to it.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.915
After you, Miss Stacy.

14:20.916 --> 14:22.583
No, no, I insist.

14:22.584 --> 14:24.249
After you, Miss Lisa.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.040

14:49.064 --> 14:50.749
'em yet.

sooner or later.

No need to burden 'em

15:08.417 --> 15:09.540
with the truth just yet.

- There'll be plenty of time
- for that later.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.791

Ooh.

15:39.875 --> 15:41.707
This is disgusting.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.332
It's not that bad.

- Yes!

34:47.375 --> 34:48.750
SAM (V.O.) Hi, Gram!

34:48.751 --> 34:50.123
It's me, Sam.

34:50.125 --> 34:51.542
I bet you never thought I'd

34:51.543 --> 34:52.956
write you a real letter, huh?

34:52.958 --> 34:54.248
Say hi to Mom for me.

34:54.250 --> 34:55.791
- Everything's been going
- so great...

34:55.793 --> 34:57.540
This past week here at camp.

34:57.541 --> 35:00.625

35:05.666 --> 35:07.083
Hey, Samantha, do you want

35:07.084 --> 35:08.500
a turn?

35:12.750 --> 35:14.708
- SAM (V.O.) I've made a ton
- of new friends.

35:14.711 --> 35:16.624
You wouldn't believe it.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.104
The counselors are real

35:18.105 --> 35:19.582
understanding and nice.

35:19.583 --> 35:21.583
One of them, Miss Jessica, got

35:21.584 --> 35:23.582
engaged right here at camp.

35:23.583 --> 35:24.707
Crazy, huh?

35:24.708 --> 35:26.999
So what can I do you for?

35:27.000 --> 35:28.875
- Well, uh, Mr. C, here's
- the thing.

35:28.878 --> 35:31.082
Dave, call me Mike, please.

35:31.083 --> 35:32.812
Of course. Uh, Mike, uh,

35:32.813 --> 35:34.540
here's the thing.

35:34.541 --> 35:35.916
Um, Jessica and I were

35:35.917 --> 35:37.290
wondering if...

35:37.291 --> 35:38.583
We'd like to have our

35:38.584 --> 35:39.874
wedding here. Please?

35:39.875 --> 35:42.000
Please, please, please, say yes.

35:42.001 --> 35:44.124
This camp means so much to me.

35:44.125 --> 35:45.583
I... of course, we can wait

35:45.584 --> 35:47.040
until next summer...

35:47.041 --> 35:48.958
and the foliage, and the end

35:48.959 --> 35:50.874
of spring is so beautiful.

35:50.875 --> 35:52.667
I just can't imagine

35:52.668 --> 35:54.457
having it anywhere else.

35:54.458 --> 35:57.332
This is a... a surprise.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.958
- Well, uh, of course, you
- know, we would pay.

35:58.961 --> 36:00.250
- And we would also provide
- our own crew...

36:00.253 --> 36:01.624
For cleanup and for teardown.

36:01.625 --> 36:03.125
- Oh, no, no. I wouldn't
- think of charging.

36:03.128 --> 36:04.625
Jessica's like family. It would

36:04.626 --> 36:06.124
be an honor and a privilege.

36:06.125 --> 36:09.124
It's just...

36:09.125 --> 36:11.958
Give me a little time to think

36:11.959 --> 36:14.790
about it, okay?

36:14.791 --> 36:15.875
But...

36:15.876 --> 36:16.957
Uh, of course, of course.

36:40.459 --> 36:42.665
fun? What's going on?

36:42.666 --> 36:43.979
Coco said that we had to do

36:43.980 --> 36:45.290
a skit about flowers...

36:45.291 --> 36:46.915

Wait, girls. Girls, girls.

36:52.541 --> 36:53.750
I think you guys are

36:53.751 --> 36:54.957
forgetting...

36:54.958 --> 36:56.979
what the talent show is all

36:56.980 --> 36:58.999
about... teamwork.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.625
How well can you cooperate

37:00.626 --> 37:02.249
and work together?

37:02.250 --> 37:04.188
I mean that's what BR's

37:04.189 --> 37:06.124
all about, right?

37:06.125 --> 37:07.707
Right?

37:07.708 --> 37:09.249
Yeah.

37:09.250 --> 37:10.563
I know you guys will come up

37:10.564 --> 37:11.874
with an amazing skit.

37:11.875 --> 37:13.854
Now there's an afternoon of fun

37:13.855 --> 37:15.832
waiting for you outside.

37:15.833 --> 37:16.896
Are you guys ready?

37:16.897 --> 37:17.957
Yeah! Yeah!

- Let's go! Come on,
- let's go and get it.

37:26.584 --> 37:28.165

They're more beautiful

37:29.230 --> 37:30.290
than I imagined.

They each have their own

37:31.376 --> 37:32.457

37:33.709 --> 37:34.957

Well, gotta go.

It's almost time for flag,

37:37.980 --> 37:39.124
and I can't miss that.

37:39.125 --> 37:41.250
Trust me. Love you, Grams.

37:41.251 --> 37:43.374
I'll write you again soon.

37:43.375 --> 37:45.229
P.S... sorry about the goat

37:45.230 --> 37:47.082
bites.

37:47.083 --> 37:48.562
I had a little friend helping

37:48.563 --> 37:50.041
me write this letter.

38:20.875 --> 38:24.040
Hello, George, it's Mike.

38:24.041 --> 38:26.416
Yeah, it's been a while.

38:26.417 --> 38:28.791
That long, eh?

38:30.208 --> 38:31.979
Yeah, I guess I was a little

38:31.980 --> 38:33.749
abrupt.

38:33.750 --> 38:35.646
Look, uh, that's what

38:35.647 --> 38:37.540
I'm callin' about.

38:37.541 --> 38:39.625
Um, I figured I owed you at

38:39.626 --> 38:41.707
least an advanced notice.

38:41.708 --> 38:43.999
After this camp season...

38:44.000 --> 38:45.792
I'm putting Black River Ranch

38:45.793 --> 38:47.583
up for sale.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.563

38:52.564 --> 38:54.124
what do you think about maybe...

38:54.125 --> 38:55.542
you could keep it open

38:55.543 --> 38:56.957
for a few more seasons?

38:56.958 --> 38:59.604
I could, uh, either run it for

38:59.605 --> 39:02.249
you, or I could train somebody.

39:02.250 --> 39:05.313

39:05.314 --> 39:08.374
we haven't had privates here...

39:08.375 --> 39:09.957

39:29.480 --> 39:30.999
any younger.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.625

39:32.626 --> 39:34.249
a little while to...

but, when Miss Lisa wakes up...

51:02.416 --> 51:04.021
the first thing she likes

51:04.022 --> 51:05.625
to do is dance.

51:15.125 --> 51:16.542
After that, Miss Lisa has

51:16.543 --> 51:17.958
to brush her teeth.

51:45.041 --> 51:46.583
Now Miss Lisa likes to

51:46.584 --> 51:48.125

54:50.791 --> 54:53.083
Team Awesome Sauce!

55:14.750 --> 55:16.458
Sage, there you are. I've been

55:16.459 --> 55:18.165
looking all over for you.

55:18.166 --> 55:20.332
Mind if I sit with you?

55:20.333 --> 55:21.707
Yeah.

55:21.708 --> 55:23.333
Okay.

55:31.208 --> 55:32.437
So I should probably tell you

55:32.438 --> 55:33.665
about my cousin.

55:33.666 --> 55:35.250
She's older than me, like

55:35.251 --> 55:36.832
15 years or so.

55:36.833 --> 55:39.812
But, uh, you know, she's got a

55:39.813 --> 55:42.790
family, she's got a career.

55:42.791 --> 55:44.979
She's actually a surgeon,

55:44.980 --> 55:47.165
so she's super smart, right?

55:47.166 --> 55:49.583
You want to know something else

55:49.584 --> 55:52.000
about my cousin?

55:53.625 --> 55:55.438
She's had a speech impediment

55:55.439 --> 55:57.249
her entire life.

55:57.250 --> 55:59.375
She said that she used to cry

55:59.376 --> 56:01.499
when she'd have to stand up...

56:01.500 --> 56:02.938
in front of all the other kids

56:02.939 --> 56:04.374
at school and talk...

56:04.375 --> 56:05.854
and I know she doesn't even like

56:05.855 --> 56:07.332
to do it to this day.

56:07.333 --> 56:09.750
And that's okay, because that's

56:09.751 --> 56:12.165
just not her thing...

56:12.166 --> 56:13.666
just like my thing is

56:13.667 --> 56:15.165
I don't dance.

56:15.166 --> 56:16.500
Have you seen me dance?

56:18.041 --> 56:19.457
It's not even called dancing...

56:19.458 --> 56:21.312
it's called tripping and falling

56:21.313 --> 56:23.165
and stumbling.

56:23.166 --> 56:25.291
But that's okay.

- friend...

56:33.522 --> 56:36.707

56:36.708 --> 56:40.790
the best part of who we are.

56:40.791 --> 56:42.999
Everyone has their weaknesses...

56:43.000 --> 56:46.438
but also we have a special

56:46.439 --> 56:49.874
talent inside...

56:49.875 --> 56:51.125
that could make the world a

56:51.126 --> 56:52.374
better place if we shared it.

56:52.375 --> 56:54.999
Do you understand?

56:55.000 --> 56:57.458
I got something for you.

56:59.750 --> 57:01.646
After our show, I ran to the

57:01.647 --> 57:03.541
cabins and I grabbed it.

57:04.750 --> 57:07.417
Kathy gave me this, because she

57:07.418 --> 57:10.082
saw something in me...

57:10.083 --> 57:12.874
that I didn't know was there.

57:12.875 --> 57:14.979
I thought it was very courageous

57:14.980 --> 57:17.082
of you tonight...

57:17.083 --> 57:18.771
to get on that stage in front

57:18.772 --> 57:20.457

57:27.958 --> 57:31.707
There is one condition, though.

57:31.708 --> 57:33.875
Don't worry, it's not pots and

57:33.876 --> 57:36.040
pans or anything like that.

57:36.041 --> 57:39.000
I want you to use that courage

57:39.001 --> 57:41.957
and try to find...

57:41.958 --> 57:45.021
that one talent, that one

57:45.022 --> 57:48.082
special thing...

57:48.083 --> 57:49.792
that will make the world

57:49.793 --> 57:51.499
a better place.

57:51.500 --> 57:53.166
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah.

57:53.169 --> 57:56.416
Okay. Okay, c'mere.

57:58.833 --> 58:01.271
Why don't we go join the others

58:01.272 --> 58:03.707
and celebrate our win...

58:03.708 --> 58:05.041
- with eating some ice cream,
- okay?

58:05.044 --> 58:06.249
Yeah!

58:06.250 --> 58:08.458
Let's go. C'mere.

58:13.750 --> 58:15.792
I'm not sure I much see the

58:15.793 --> 58:17.832
point of tellin"em right now.

58:17.833 --> 58:19.125
- What they don't know
- won't hurt 'em...

58:19.128 --> 58:20.832
I guess is what I'm thinkin'.

58:20.833 --> 58:21.937
Could be that's the way

58:21.938 --> 58:23.040
to handle it, sure.

58:23.041 --> 58:24.915
But?

58:24.916 --> 58:26.583
I ever tell you about my

58:26.584 --> 58:28.249
cousin Dan?

58:28.250 --> 58:30.208
One summer, when we was about,

58:30.209 --> 58:32.165
oh, ten or so...

58:32.166 --> 58:34.250
my uncle told him to go pick up

58:34.251 --> 58:36.332
a bag of horse feed...

58:36.333 --> 58:38.083
down at the supply store down

58:38.084 --> 58:39.832
the road a ways.

58:39.833 --> 58:41.229
Now Dan, he didn't weigh much

58:41.230 --> 58:42.624
more...

58:42.625 --> 58:44.500
- than that 50-pound bag
- of food did.

58:44.503 --> 58:45.729
And when he got there

58:45.730 --> 58:46.957
and he saw how heavy it was...

58:46.958 --> 58:48.708
he decided that he would drag it

58:48.709 --> 58:50.457
all the way home...

58:50.458 --> 58:51.979
was about three miles or so,

58:51.980 --> 58:53.499
I think it was.

58:53.500 --> 58:54.749
Well, did he make it?

58:54.750 --> 58:56.999
Yeah, eventually.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.042
He was always a stubborn kid.

58:59.043 --> 59:01.082
Took him half the day.

59:01.083 --> 59:02.604
And he was pretty rung out,

59:02.605 --> 59:04.124
sore for days afterward.

59:04.125 --> 59:05.500
Lost a big chunk of the food,

59:05.501 --> 59:06.874
too, on account of the hole...

59:06.875 --> 59:09.125
- he wore in the bag by draggin'
- it like that.

59:09.128 --> 59:11.750
Funny thing is, I remember

59:11.751 --> 59:14.374
riding my bike down to check...

59:14.375 --> 59:15.708
on him a couple of times and I

59:15.709 --> 59:17.040
asked him if he needed any help.

59:17.041 --> 59:18.666
He just kept saying, "No, I can

59:18.667 --> 59:20.291
do it. I can do it."

59:22.416 --> 59:23.916
- Just, you know, I always
- wondered why he wouldn't...

59:23.919 --> 59:25.562
Let anyone share the burden,

59:25.563 --> 59:27.207
so to speak.

59:27.208 --> 59:28.500
Save him a lot of extra trouble

59:28.501 --> 59:29.790
I would think, don't you?

59:29.791 --> 59:30.958
You know a way to help me,

59:30.959 --> 59:32.124
Jerry?

59:32.125 --> 59:35.082
Me? No... wish I did.

59:35.083 --> 59:36.812
But you know somebody who

59:36.813 --> 59:38.540
might be able to?

59:38.541 --> 59:40.790
I really don't.

59:40.791 --> 59:43.396
But the thing is, we won't

59:43.397 --> 59:46.000
know unless we ask.

59:52.333 --> 59:55.666
( MUSIC PLAYING )

01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:13.957
What's up?

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:15.625
So that vaulting thing you

01:00:15.626 --> 01:00:17.290
were telling me about?

01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:18.499
Can I still do that?

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:19.938
Yeah! But what changed

01:00:19.939 --> 01:00:21.374
your mind?

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:22.771
Well, when I was practicing

01:00:22.772 --> 01:00:24.165
for the talent show...

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:25.875
- the whole time I was just
- thinking...

01:00:25.878 --> 01:00:27.938
How amazing would it be to do

01:00:27.939 --> 01:00:29.999
that on a horse.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.104
Absolutely... but there's just

01:00:33.105 --> 01:00:36.207
one condition...

01:00:36.208 --> 01:00:38.208
and you're not gonna like it.

01:00:43.541 --> 01:00:46.707
No. Unh-unh. No way.

01:00:46.708 --> 01:00:49.540
Worst idea ever!

01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:52.957
Yes way, and best idea ever!

01:00:52.958 --> 01:00:54.625
With Sam's gymnastic ability,

01:00:54.626 --> 01:00:56.290
she could be a great vaulter...

01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:57.854
and you know it... just needs

01:00:57.855 --> 01:00:59.415
to learn from the best...

01:00:59.416 --> 01:01:01.291
and that's you.

01:01:04.458 --> 01:01:06.792
Fine, but only if she listens

01:01:06.793 --> 01:01:09.124
to every single thing I say.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.563
Fine, but only if you don't

01:01:10.564 --> 01:01:11.999
give me your pointers...

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.082
when I'm trying to concentrate.

01:01:15.083 --> 01:01:16.207
Fine.

01:01:16.208 --> 01:01:17.375
Great! You guys wanna shake

01:01:17.376 --> 01:01:18.541
hands?

01:01:26.166 --> 01:01:27.916
All right.

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:34.415
Sam? This letter came for you.

01:01:34.416 --> 01:01:35.750
Thanks!

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:46.000
- GRAM (V.O.) I had a feeling
- you'd thrive there...

01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:47.707
At camp, honey bear.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:49.167
It makes me so happy to know

01:01:49.168 --> 01:01:50.624
you're making friends...

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.500
and I want to hear all

01:01:52.501 --> 01:01:54.374
about them.

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:55.583
It sounds like you'll have

01:01:55.584 --> 01:01:56.790
a wonderful experience...

01:01:56.791 --> 01:01:58.021
to share with them

01:01:58.022 --> 01:01:59.249
for the rest of your life.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:00.938
Keep making the most

01:02:00.939 --> 01:02:02.624
of your time there.

01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:04.188
I can't wait to see you

01:02:04.189 --> 01:02:05.749
in the final show...

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:07.040
at the end of summer.

01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:08.625
- It'll be here
- before you know it.

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:14.583
Love you, Gram.

01:02:31.708 --> 01:02:33.750
- Listen up, ladies.
- I have a brief announcement.

01:02:33.753 --> 01:02:35.332
This will only take a minute.

01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:39.999
Uh...

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.646
this is gonna be a little

01:02:41.647 --> 01:02:43.291
more difficult than I thought.

01:02:44.833 --> 01:02:46.208
You know that attendance here

01:02:46.209 --> 01:02:47.582
at Black River Ranch...

01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:49.104
for the last few years

01:02:49.105 --> 01:02:50.624
has been dropping off.

01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:52.771
The ranch has been losing money

01:02:52.772 --> 01:02:54.915
for several years...

01:02:54.916 --> 01:02:57.666
a lot of money.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.542
Things just can't keep going

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.207
the way they're going.

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:03.937
What are you talking about,

01:03:03.938 --> 01:03:05.665
Mr. C?

01:03:05.666 --> 01:03:06.875
I'm saying that this

01:03:06.876 --> 01:03:08.082
is the last season...

01:03:08.083 --> 01:03:09.146

01:03:09.147 --> 01:03:10.208

01:03:11.125 --> 01:03:12.957
No! Oh no, no.

01:03:12.958 --> 01:03:14.833
- At the end of the season,
- we're dismantling the camp...

01:03:14.836 --> 01:03:16.125
And putting the property up

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.415
for sale.

01:03:17.416 --> 01:03:19.500
I, uh, I thought you deserved

01:03:19.501 --> 01:03:21.582
to know.

01:03:21.583 --> 01:03:24.271
Uh, I know this is bitter news

01:03:24.272 --> 01:03:26.957
to swallow...

01:03:26.958 --> 01:03:28.937
but, uh, the summer's

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.915
only half over...

01:03:30.916 --> 01:03:32.958

- girls out there...

of their lives.

So let's make sure they get

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:37.375
that, all right?

01:03:38.583 --> 01:03:40.708
All right, let's get back at it.

01:03:40.709 --> 01:03:42.833
All right, back at it.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.665
I am so sorry, Jessica.

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:00.791
- I would have done anything to
- arrange for you...

To have your wedding here but I,

01:04:02.167 --> 01:04:03.541
I just couldn't swing it.

- Do you even know
- what a team is?

No, I'm talking to the horse.

Yes, you.

I did.

Please?

Hey, is this some kind of

01:06:34.063 --> 01:06:35.332
joke, Stacy?

01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:36.790
Of... of course not.

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:38.333
- It's just that Black River
- really...

01:06:38.336 --> 01:06:39.749
Well, it sure sounds like one.

01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:40.938
After all of the money I have

01:06:40.939 --> 01:06:42.124
dumped into that camp...

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:43.458
over the years, they've got to

01:06:43.459 --> 01:06:44.790
be out of their minds...

01:06:44.791 --> 01:06:46.833
- if they think I'm going to throw
- away good money...

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.540
On some charity case.

01:06:48.541 --> 01:06:50.771
It's not a charity case.

01:06:50.772 --> 01:06:52.999
They just need a little help.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.688
It's not my fault if they don't

01:06:54.689 --> 01:06:56.374
know how to run a business.

01:06:56.375 --> 01:06:57.708

company from nothing...

01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:01.207

01:07:06.166 --> 01:07:07.291
I said they know how to run

01:07:07.292 --> 01:07:08.415
a business. It's just...

01:07:08.416 --> 01:07:09.915
Well, obviously they don't.

01:07:09.916 --> 01:07:11.125
- And if you can't tell the
- difference...

01:07:11.128 --> 01:07:13.125
- I'm starting to wonder why
- I'm spending all this money...

01:07:21.272 --> 01:07:22.500
to get to.

01:07:38.458 --> 01:07:39.957
So what did he say?

01:07:39.958 --> 01:07:41.833
I said he would, didn't I?

01:07:57.333 --> 01:07:59.707
And the arbor will go there.

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.833
- And the guests, they'll sit
- over there.

01:08:01.836 --> 01:08:03.625
And the band, oh, the band

01:08:03.626 --> 01:08:05.415

No, the incredibly beautiful

Get a room?

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:38.417

Yeah, Sam!

01:09:21.416 --> 01:09:22.604
How did she get so good

so fast?

01:09:23.791 --> 01:09:25.416
That was pathetic. Why did I

01:09:25.417 --> 01:09:27.040
even agree to train you?

01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:29.041
You obviously have no talent

talk, or to lunge while I teach?

would probably go...
