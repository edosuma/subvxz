WEBVTT

00:10.923 --> 00:13.796
I'm leaving, Sandra.
I'm going to America.

00:13.926 --> 00:16.407
I really hope you have
a very happy life.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.281
Come on, you know me

00:20.411 --> 00:21.717
-better than that.
-I thought I did,

00:21.847 --> 00:23.414
and then you fucked my wife.

00:34.643 --> 00:35.861
Off we go, then.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.341
What is it?

00:37.472 --> 00:38.603
I can't go.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.475
<i>This is my home.</i>

00:40.605 --> 00:42.825
If that's not worth
fighting for,

00:42.955 --> 00:44.522
then what is worth fighting for?

00:44.653 --> 00:47.003
So, um, are the two of you
back together?

00:47.134 --> 00:48.309
-We were never together.
-Oh, please.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.311
<i>You're dying to fuck each other.</i>

00:50.441 --> 00:51.616
No, you're way off base.

00:51.747 --> 00:52.748
You won't need your condom.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.142
Mm, why's that?

00:55.272 --> 00:57.883
Because you didn't use it last
time and I'm already pregnant.

00:58.014 --> 01:01.496
This is John Salt's fancy woman.

01:01.626 --> 01:04.368
-Oh, my poor hero. <i>
So we'll see how</i>

01:04.499 --> 01:06.544
her fella likes having
a loved one torn from his bosom.

01:06.675 --> 01:09.112
We have an agent
inside the Raven Union.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.418
They could kill
the entire population of London

01:10.548 --> 01:11.593
with a device

01:11.723 --> 01:13.421
<i>the size of a cigarette lighter.</i>

01:13.551 --> 01:16.424
Secret meetings
with the prime minister

01:16.554 --> 01:18.687
of the English League.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.428
I went to speak to him
on your behalf.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.430
I thought you'd approve.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.736
Do you speak for Harwood
and the Union or for yourself?

01:24.867 --> 01:26.912
I speak for the good
of the English people.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.610
<i>God help you if Stormcloud
is ever deployed.</i>

01:30.002 --> 01:32.266
<i>God help all of us.</i>

01:34.006 --> 01:35.095
<i>Girls.
We've come
to get you out.</i>

01:35.225 --> 01:37.184
We've got a car and a driver
down the road.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.534
How do you propose to do that?
That's the British Army outside.

01:39.664 --> 01:40.883
The house is surrounded.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.754
<i>I ask you to surrender yourself.</i>

01:42.885 --> 01:45.583
I'll surrender tomorrow,
and only to Colonel Salt.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.455
We can have
a-a splendid evening together.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.065
Lovely.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.372
Soldiers of the Raven Union,

01:51.502 --> 01:53.591
I order you
to lay down your arms.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.681
-Onward!
-No!

02:00.032 --> 02:02.687
Lord Harwood's sad demise
has given us pause.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.472
<i>This war has gone on
long enough.</i>

02:04.602 --> 02:07.344
We could hold talks
in the spirit of new beginnings.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.172
We invited you here
in good faith.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.348
What remains of League forces,
and both of you personally,

02:11.479 --> 02:12.958
must surrender unconditionally.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.352
If you fail to do so,
we will deploy

02:15.483 --> 02:17.876
a Stormcloud device over London.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.661
The Raven Union Council
won't sanction...

02:19.791 --> 02:20.836
The Council will do what I say!

02:20.966 --> 02:22.707
-Yes.
-Yes.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.494
I say yes.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.313
Don't you dare move.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.837
Mum.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.325
Oh, it's you, is it?

03:17.501 --> 03:19.808
Hello, Alfred.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.506
-Good morning, Mr. Pennyworth.
-Jesus.

03:22.637 --> 03:25.030
-What happened to you?
-Not as bad as it looks.

03:25.161 --> 03:27.468
I know they're up to no good,
but they're your friends,

03:27.598 --> 03:29.992
so I can't
very well extricate them.

03:30.122 --> 03:31.907
If you lot upset him
and his stitches come out,

03:32.037 --> 03:33.604
I'll have your guts for garters.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.217
Who wants tea?

03:39.741 --> 03:42.091
Lucius is the one who's
actually seen this at work.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.007
Yeah, and it's not
pretty. That stuff is violent.

03:45.137 --> 03:47.401
-And we've got 48...
Oi!

03:47.531 --> 03:48.706
No whispering.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.578
48 hours.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.493
48 hours?

03:52.623 --> 03:53.842
-Fuck.
From yesterday.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.496
We have till 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.846
-Fuck.
Language.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.109
-You say "fuck."
-Not in company.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.024
Just so you don't accuse me
of hiding things from you,

04:02.154 --> 04:03.852
this lot is saying that

04:03.982 --> 04:05.767
the Raven Union's gonna drop
that terror bomb

04:05.897 --> 04:07.812
unless the League surrenders
by tomorrow afternoon.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.205
You said they wouldn't do that.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.989
You said the war was
practically over.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.904
I was wrong.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.079
We haven't been
beaten yet. We have a plan.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.951
Oh, here it comes.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.779
Don't you listen to them, Alfie.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.650
The entire stock of Stormcloud

04:19.781 --> 04:21.913
is in a laboratory at Raven HQ
in a bottle this size.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.046
In a fortress this size.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.788
I'm still officially
CIA station chief.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.094
An important ally of the Ravens.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.879
I show up unannounced,
bringing them back

04:31.009 --> 04:32.576
-their missing scientist...
-Then what?

04:32.707 --> 04:33.925
Then we steal Stormcloud
from them.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.753
-How?
-I don't know.

04:35.884 --> 04:36.928
We'll improvise, I guess.

04:37.059 --> 04:37.973
That's your plan?

04:40.192 --> 04:41.803
No chance.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.979
It's a suicide mission.

04:44.109 --> 04:45.633
Not if we have an expert
in such things with us.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.635
Exactly.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.768
And who's gonna bell the cat?

04:53.075 --> 04:54.555
Oh, I know.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.078
Alfie.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.122
I'm sorry, Mrs. Pennyworth.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.950
It's desperate times.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.604
Do you think I don't know that?

05:00.735 --> 05:02.432
I'd steal the wicked stuff
myself if I could.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.684
Why is it
my boy has to risk his neck?

05:36.814 --> 05:38.860
He's not well.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.818
A couple of aspirin

05:40.949 --> 05:42.472
and some of your egg soldiers,
I'll be fine.

05:42.603 --> 05:43.691
-You'll do it?

05:43.821 --> 05:45.823
Nothing good on the telly.

05:45.954 --> 05:46.998
Thank you, Alfie. Thank you.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.173
Don't you dare thank him.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.958
He's not doing anything for you.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.177
You can't, son.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.136
You said yourself,

05:54.266 --> 05:55.964
"It's a suicide mission.
No chance."

05:56.094 --> 05:58.749
No, I meant no chance
without me along.

05:58.880 --> 05:59.837
You stay where you are.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.186
I'm not going anywhere yet.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.840
Just need to stretch.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.712
See?

06:04.842 --> 06:06.017
Match fit.

06:08.933 --> 06:11.371
Tea.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.851
Just the ticket.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.418
Oh, you fucker.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.421
All right?

06:19.857 --> 06:21.685
You wouldn't happen to have

06:21.816 --> 06:23.339
any of that nice shortbread,
Mrs. P., eh?

06:23.470 --> 06:25.646
Oh, you had it all yesterday,
you greedy sod!

06:27.865 --> 06:30.520
I had, what, two fingers, maybe?

06:30.651 --> 06:33.088
Why's she's so angry?

06:33.218 --> 06:35.699
These lot have come up
with another mad job for us.

06:40.138 --> 06:43.011
Oh, you bastards.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.795
Fuck's sake.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.282
Hey, come here.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.938
It's just another job, Mum.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.070
Do you think I'm bloody stupid?

07:00.289 --> 07:01.856
You're gonna leave me
all alone in the world.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.553
Nah.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.207
Come here.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.430
I'll be back
before you know I'm gone.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.477
It's cake, Mum.

07:14.608 --> 07:15.783
Cake.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.044
What the fuck?
It's nearly midnight.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.262
Sorry, Sid. Wrong window.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.177
Yanks barred you, did they?

08:46.308 --> 08:48.528
-Moral turpitude, I suppose.
-Sandra!

08:53.968 --> 08:56.318
Why don't you fuck off?
-Go away, Dad.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.538
You're onto better things, girl.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.017
Don't waste your time
with that tosspot.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.150
Go away, Dad.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.283
Give us a shout if you need me.

09:10.854 --> 09:11.986
Hello, Sandra.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.857
Not gone, then?

09:15.337 --> 09:17.078
Changed me mind.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.952
What's happened to Mrs. Troy?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.565
Gone to America.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.090
That's very ironic, isn't it?

09:29.220 --> 09:31.222
You still got the hump with me?

09:31.353 --> 09:33.224
Can't believe
you're so unforgiving.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.052
You're mugging me off,
aren't you?

09:35.183 --> 09:36.880
Yeah.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.188
I like to see you get angry.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.277
Puts a glow on you.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.714
Why are you here, Alfie,
if not to say sorry?

09:44.845 --> 09:47.108
Say sorry?

09:47.238 --> 09:49.197
I hadn't thought of that one.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.373
I will if it'll help.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.157
Help what?

09:55.333 --> 09:57.858
I'm off on a lairy job tomorrow.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.034
Might not come back
sort of business.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.994
I'm scared, Sand.
Don't want to be alone.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.519
Oh, give over, Alfie.

10:07.650 --> 10:08.956
How many times have you tried
that line on me?

10:09.086 --> 10:11.001
It's a good line.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.655
And this time, it's true.

10:15.832 --> 10:16.877
It's not enough.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.357
No, I know.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.143
I'm sorry, Sandra.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.016
I am.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.020
What would you be sorry for?

10:32.544 --> 10:34.024
I'm sorry that
I love you too much

10:34.155 --> 10:36.157
to pretend I won't let you down.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.945
Say that again-- slowly.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.166
We could get married
and have kids and all that,

10:45.296 --> 10:46.646
and I know I'd be very happy.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.171
But one day,
I'd up and leave you.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.305
I'd break your heart.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.307
Then I'd be ashamed
for the rest of me life.

10:58.527 --> 10:59.963
That's what I'm sorry for.

11:07.101 --> 11:08.319
You bastard.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.154
Tell him to fuck off home.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.721
Shut up, Dad.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.382
You beauty.

11:29.776 --> 11:33.040
I'm very glad to have your
company, gentlemen, but, um,

11:33.170 --> 11:35.433
is there nobody you want to see
before your mission?

11:35.564 --> 11:37.348
No loved ones?

11:39.437 --> 11:41.222
Very far away.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.964
Very far.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.487
Uh...

11:45.617 --> 11:48.577
Me? No.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.058
Most people I know are dead.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.450
Well, then.

11:55.410 --> 11:56.846
Here's to new friends.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.241
-To new friends.
-To new friends.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.246
Ah.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.217
Go away.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.872
Martha, will you
marry me, please?

12:25.657 --> 12:27.442
No.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.055
Why not?
I asked nicely this time.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.796
You're only asking
because I'm pregnant.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.580
Not true. I'm asking you now
because you're pregnant.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.408
I-I would be asking you anyhow.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.541
-Just at a later date, probably.
-Why?

12:39.671 --> 12:41.891
Because I love you, damn it.
Why else?

12:43.414 --> 12:44.764
Well...

12:46.504 --> 12:48.332
Okay.

12:48.463 --> 12:49.769
Good answer.

12:51.466 --> 12:55.035
I...

12:55.165 --> 12:57.428
-I guess I love you, too.
-You guess?

12:57.559 --> 12:59.126
Well, I kind of thought
that being in love might be

12:59.256 --> 13:01.258
more, you know, fun.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.043
Yeah, me, too.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.174
It's kind of irritating,
actually.

13:04.305 --> 13:05.219
-Isn't it?
Yeah.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.047
Yeah, it is.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.660
Excellent.
Well, um, job done.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.183
Feelings thoroughly discussed.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.663
Can we agree to get married now?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.447
No. It's not that simple.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.754
Let me make it simple.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.538
I have to go
on a perilous mission,

13:20.669 --> 13:22.584
and we're having
a baby together.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.804
If I die,
don't you want to be able

13:24.934 --> 13:27.241
to say something nice
about me to our kid?

13:27.371 --> 13:29.634
Or do you want to tell them
that I asked you to marry me

13:29.765 --> 13:32.072
and you said "meh"?

13:34.117 --> 13:35.466
You have a point.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.468
It's a morbid one,
but it's a point.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.341
Is that a yes?
It sounds like a yes.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.038
It's not a no,
but it's also not...

13:42.169 --> 13:43.997
It's progress. Say no more.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.476
No, I didn't say w...

14:25.560 --> 14:28.345
-Mmm.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.523
Salt.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.397
Put her through,
then get off the line.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.054
Vikki, my dove.
What a nice surprise.

14:43.317 --> 14:45.580
Mm, I wish I could be there,
but I'm going to be

14:45.710 --> 14:47.887
very busy this week,
what with one thing and another.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.239
That would be
an even nicer surprise.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.328
But really, I can't get away.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.506
Tell him you're all wet
thinking about him.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.638
-Sorry?
-Fuck's sake!

15:00.769 --> 15:02.162
Tell him you're all wet
thinking about him.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.559
I'm all wet...

15:08.690 --> 15:10.344
-thinking about you. <i>
Ah.</i>

15:10.474 --> 15:13.260
I see. That's...

15:13.390 --> 15:15.392
That's gratifying.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.394
Indeed. Well, um...

15:17.525 --> 15:18.700
<i>you must come here to me.</i>

15:18.830 --> 15:21.355
Yes. Yes.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.487
<i>-Thank you. Lovely.
-I'll send a car.</i>

15:23.618 --> 15:25.272
<i>I have a window
in my schedule tomorrow.</i>

15:25.402 --> 15:27.056
Can't wait to see you.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.671
We'll see who's wet
tomorrow, eh?

15:33.802 --> 15:35.499
I'll show him the window
in his fucking schedule.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.450
You are going to get yourself
killed, aren't you?

16:19.674 --> 16:21.284
Sooner or later.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.726
Not if you kill me first
with your animal lust.

16:53.621 --> 16:54.752
Please come back.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.682
Course I will.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.692
If I don't,
we had a good old bunk-up

17:21.823 --> 17:23.433
before I left, didn't we?

17:28.960 --> 17:30.614
Hmm.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.618
Why'd you have to
call it a bunk-up?

17:38.579 --> 17:40.189
Why can't you say we made love?

17:46.804 --> 17:47.805
You're right.

17:50.330 --> 17:51.331
We did.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.424
We made love.

You should go
for a Japanese vehicle.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.622
Much more reliable
and efficient.

20:32.753 --> 20:35.799
America, he says.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.888
We'll be dead
before the end of the day.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.674
America, indeed.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.719
Who dares wins, eh?
-Get to fuck.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.678
-You get to fuck.
-Guys.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.651
U.S. government business.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.786
Tell your bosses
CIA Station Chief Thomas Wayne

21:05.916 --> 21:08.919
is here with their missing
scientist, Dr. Lucius Fox.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.574
And I don't like
to be kept waiting.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.402
Got that, soldier?

21:14.838 --> 21:16.753
Yes, sir.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.111
Says he's CIA.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.333
The CIA station chief.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.684
And Lucius Fox.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.904
-At the gate?
-That's what they say.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.645
Huh.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.603
Strange.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.039
Send them up.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.694
I should be in Gotham City,

21:44.825 --> 21:48.219
scoffing a beefsteak, but no.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.744
Fuck's sake. How many times
do I have to say sorry?

21:55.052 --> 21:55.879
Bingo.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.929
Right into the dragon's mouth.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.510
For honor and for England,

22:17.640 --> 22:20.077
<i>the future is in your hands.</i>

22:20.208 --> 22:22.732
<i>Final victory is on the horizon.</i>

22:22.863 --> 22:25.213
<i>The battle is almost won.</i>

22:25.344 --> 22:27.998
<i>Strength, tradition and honor.</i>

23:12.260 --> 23:14.654
You are entering
a restricted area.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.656
<i>No unauthorized personnel
beyond this point.</i>

23:22.009 --> 23:23.097
- [soldier #1] Oi!
- [soldier #2] What the fuck?

23:29.103 --> 23:30.626
Excuse me. Um...

23:30.757 --> 23:31.975
Dr. Fox, you're back.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.021
Evidently.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.675
Don't fucking move.

23:38.242 --> 23:40.027
-How you all doing?
-Good. Um...

23:42.377 --> 23:46.163
I'm sorry, but you had to know
this stuff is wrong.

23:46.294 --> 23:49.079
-What are you doing?
-We're scientists, not killers.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.081
Science is supposed to be
a noble calling.

23:51.212 --> 23:52.996
Lucius, we need
to keep this moving.

23:53.127 --> 23:54.563
Right.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.062
Miss Dixon.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.846
Hmm?

24:16.977 --> 24:17.978
I'll go and greet them.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.110
Come on.

24:54.797 --> 24:56.930
If this breaks,

24:57.060 --> 24:59.280
everyone in
a five-mile radius dies.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.325
Nice.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.893
You should be fucking ashamed
of yourselves.

25:09.377 --> 25:10.726
Is that all there is?

25:10.857 --> 25:11.858
-Yes.
-No extra batch?

25:11.988 --> 25:13.773
No.

25:13.903 --> 25:15.688
You sure?
-Yes, sir.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.385
She's telling the truth.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.256
They could only cook up
enough for one bomb.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.128
Let's be off, then, eh?
Come on.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.481
Just for the record,
my actions today were in no way

25:26.612 --> 25:28.135
sanctioned by
the U.S. government.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.180
They are entirely
my own responsibility.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.661
You done? Want to sign
a receipt or something?

25:32.792 --> 25:34.184
Come on.

26:04.519 --> 26:05.825
Come on.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.954
Drop your weapons.

27:32.085 --> 27:33.869
-Hands up.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.044
-Fuck.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.350
Stay where you are.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.830
-Put the guns down.
-Easy, now.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.310
Steady on, boys.

27:41.572 --> 27:42.965
Don't shoot.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.447
Now, you see this?

27:46.577 --> 27:47.927
This is Stormcloud in here.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.104
So drop your guns

27:51.234 --> 27:54.020
and get out of our way,
or I'll drop this...

27:54.150 --> 27:55.238
and everyone in here will die.

27:58.372 --> 27:59.678
Drop your guns!

28:02.245 --> 28:03.986
Can't do that.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.553
Course you can.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.163
Keep your guns up, lads.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.819
Gentlemen, Mr. Pennyworth.

28:10.950 --> 28:11.951
Pleased to meet you again.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.214
Oh, fudge.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.695
I'm afraid
we can't let you leave.

28:18.435 --> 28:19.872
You heard me.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.917
I'll drop this.

28:22.048 --> 28:24.354
You're the man in control here.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.400
That will be your choice.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.576
Uh, do please bear in mind

28:28.707 --> 28:30.752
the many thousands
of good people who live nearby.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.190
You'll be the most successful
mass murderer

28:34.321 --> 28:35.322
in English history.

28:35.452 --> 28:37.411
Fuck.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.326
I fucking told you.

28:39.456 --> 28:40.893
Not now.

28:51.512 --> 28:54.384
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

28:54.515 --> 28:58.127
Give them a good drubbing,
then take them to the basement.

29:05.265 --> 29:08.224
Will you please sit still?

29:08.355 --> 29:10.009
Have a drink with me.

29:10.139 --> 29:11.271
I'm good.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.757
You need to relax.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.457
You're testing me, right?

29:23.587 --> 29:25.285
Sorry, I don't follow you.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.375
You want to know
if I'm pregnant.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.072
Do I?

29:31.421 --> 29:33.119
The answer is yes.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.337
-Are you?
-Mm-hmm.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.992
That's wonderful.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.560
My dear woman, congratulations.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.780
Well, that's very liberal
of you.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.564
I think most people
would try to hide dismay.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.609
At a child out of wedlock?

29:45.740 --> 29:49.091
Well, now of all times,
we must celebrate new life.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.789
Cheers.

29:52.181 --> 29:53.574
Mmm.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.271
Ah.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.451
We're nobbled, Mr. Aziz.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.410
All four of us are okay,
as of now.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.066
This dosser Salt wants a word.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.070
-Hello. <i>
Hello, old chap.</i>

30:15.335 --> 30:17.467
Dear me, what childish antics.

30:17.598 --> 30:19.687
But no harm done.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.037
<i>My generous offer still stands.</i>

30:23.299 --> 30:25.911
<i>I won't press you
for an answer now,</i>

30:26.041 --> 30:28.435
<i>but I expect to hear from you
before the 4:00 deadline,</i>

30:28.565 --> 30:30.089
<i>as agreed.</i>

30:38.749 --> 30:41.404
What did you call me?

30:43.276 --> 30:45.408
Dosser.

30:45.539 --> 30:47.671
That's just the sort
of filthy vulgarity

30:47.802 --> 30:49.978
we shall stamp out
in the very near future.

30:51.850 --> 30:52.981
-For God's sake, stop that!
-He has rights.

30:53.112 --> 30:54.940
And I'm violating them!

30:55.984 --> 30:57.464
What are you gonna do
about that?

30:57.594 --> 30:59.118
We're American citizens.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.467
There'll be
consequences for this.

31:00.597 --> 31:03.818
You're renegades, desperadoes.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.428
Shouldn't think they'll make
too much of a fuss

31:05.559 --> 31:07.474
if you disappear, do you?

31:07.604 --> 31:08.518
This is what
you're fighting for, is it?

31:08.649 --> 31:11.130
Sadism and barbarity?

31:13.393 --> 31:15.264
Cruelty and strength,
I'd call it.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.745
But yes...

31:17.876 --> 31:19.878
that's what we're fighting for.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.403
Do you know why, gentlemen?

31:24.665 --> 31:26.623
Because it works.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.368
Where are you...
where are you taking him?

31:36.720 --> 31:37.678
Did he say anything
about Thomas?

31:37.808 --> 31:39.767
Just what I said he said.

31:39.898 --> 31:40.899
All four of them are okay.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.295
What now?

31:49.603 --> 31:52.519
-We'll start burning records.
-Mm-hmm.

31:52.649 --> 31:54.651
We'll try to get the queen
out of the country.

31:59.526 --> 32:02.616
And then I think, um,

32:02.746 --> 32:06.228
a lamb curry
and an ice-cold Chablis.

32:06.359 --> 32:08.622
A nice nap.

32:08.752 --> 32:11.233
Then, um, surrender.

32:13.844 --> 32:15.455
Couldn't you try
the Americans again?

32:15.585 --> 32:17.805
I already have, twice.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.503
They were extremely nice about
it, but, um, they want us gone.

32:35.475 --> 32:38.478
When we first met, I took you
for the mercenary type.

32:38.608 --> 32:40.959
But here you are,

32:41.089 --> 32:42.612
throwing your life away
for a hopeless cause.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.095
You're a man of honor.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.753
This country needs men like you
alive and hard at work.

32:52.883 --> 32:55.060
Here we go.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.713
Save your breath.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.367
The answer's no.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.631
Of course.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.024
A man of honor.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.853
Just misguided.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.550
I'd like to put you right.

33:31.357 --> 33:32.532
Dad?

33:33.750 --> 33:35.274
Hello, son.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.542
Oh.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.500
This is another bloody dream.

33:46.328 --> 33:47.503
Do you think so?

33:51.681 --> 33:53.205
I'm real, you idiot.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.598
This isn't a dream.

34:02.953 --> 34:04.564
See?

34:11.397 --> 34:12.789
Modern science, son.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.359
Anything's possible.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.451
I'm very pleased
to see you, Dad.

34:26.499 --> 34:29.545
But Mum goes to your grave
every Sunday.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.549
Don't see why.

34:35.595 --> 34:37.075
She knows there's nobody in it.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.392
She thought you were ashes.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.484
She's been grieving ever since.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.227
Broken, she was.

35:00.446 --> 35:02.883
Close to topping herself.

35:03.013 --> 35:04.885
And all the while, you were

35:05.015 --> 35:06.756
rolling round up here,
happy as a tea trolley.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.804
I miss her terribly.

35:13.372 --> 35:15.504
But...

35:15.635 --> 35:17.550
I didn't want her
to see me like this.

35:20.030 --> 35:22.381
Like what?

35:22.511 --> 35:23.730
Alive?

35:26.080 --> 35:28.735
Would you want your wife
to see you like this?

35:34.044 --> 35:35.524
No.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.660
I'd hope she'd want
to see me, though.

35:43.184 --> 35:47.319
Like Mum would want to see you,
despite all you've done.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.147
Would she, do you think?

35:51.497 --> 35:53.629
Would she forgive me?

35:53.760 --> 35:55.196
I doubt it.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.417
Oh, she would.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.594
Too bloody kind.

36:04.901 --> 36:06.425
You know they're gonna drop
a terror bomb on her?

36:07.817 --> 36:10.472
Did you know that?

36:10.603 --> 36:13.040
If I'm willing to see
other men's loved ones

36:13.171 --> 36:15.260
die for the struggle...

36:20.134 --> 36:23.833
...I have to be willing to see
my own loved ones die, too.

36:23.964 --> 36:26.532
It's only right.

36:26.662 --> 36:30.536
You always were an arrogant,
narrow-minded old fool.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.799
Now you've gone fucking mad.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.583
Not mad, son.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.847
Determined.

36:40.807 --> 36:43.375
Join me, Alfie.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.507
The war's near won.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.857
A bright dawn is coming
for this country.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.946
Fuck this fucking country!

36:50.077 --> 36:51.992
How can you be so selfish?!

36:52.122 --> 36:56.475
Great change requires
great sacrifice.

36:57.954 --> 37:00.348
-Join me, son.
-Join you?

37:02.132 --> 37:04.483
If my hands were untied,
I'd strangle you

37:04.613 --> 37:06.702
and pretend this was all
a fucking dream.

37:08.617 --> 37:12.404
Please,
think about this a while.

37:13.666 --> 37:14.623
Bollocks.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.498
It's you that should
do the thinking.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.587
Think about
what you've done to Mum!

37:21.717 --> 37:23.719
Think about her!

37:37.733 --> 37:39.605
Your dad?

37:39.735 --> 37:41.694
As alive as you are.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.565
Wanted me to join him
and the Ravens.

37:43.696 --> 37:44.871
Told him to sling his hook,
of course.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.699
That's mental.

37:48.657 --> 37:50.485
Your head must be
fucking fucked, eh?

37:50.616 --> 37:52.661
Bit of a shocker, yeah.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.926
I wonder why he met with you.

37:59.146 --> 38:01.279
Told you-- wanted me to join up.

38:02.976 --> 38:04.673
Surely, your father knows
his own son.

38:05.979 --> 38:07.459
He knows you'd refuse.

38:07.589 --> 38:10.462
Yeah. He knows.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.464
So why meet with you?

38:12.594 --> 38:14.335
Hmm.

38:14.466 --> 38:16.990
To be precise, why did Salt
let him meet with you?

38:19.079 --> 38:20.950
Salt doesn't do things
for sentimental reasons.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.824
He has some plan in mind.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.086
What's he need a plan for?

38:26.216 --> 38:28.088
We're fucked already.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.786
You're a fucking
broken record, you are.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.008
I'm sorry.

38:36.879 --> 38:39.099
I tried my best.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.623
Well, it was a long shot anyway.

38:41.754 --> 38:42.842
Worth a try.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.324
Plan B, then.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.766
Anything bad happens,

38:53.896 --> 38:55.550
and you're dead.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.726
So best be good, eh?

39:05.604 --> 39:06.474
Hello, Miss DuFrench.

39:14.177 --> 39:15.570
Miss DuFrench.

39:15.701 --> 39:18.225
How nice to see you again.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.750
They're a special request...

39:23.709 --> 39:25.754
...from the high chancellor.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.234
Mm.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.627
Are they on a movement order?

39:28.757 --> 39:31.020
I'm not meant to issue passes

39:31.151 --> 39:33.327
without a written
movement order.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.763
The kind of movement
he's ordered,

39:34.894 --> 39:36.199
you'd not want in writing, love.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.345
-Hello.
-Hello.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.826
This the, uh,
women's wing, is it?
-It is.

39:53.956 --> 39:56.002
-Which one's Gaunt?
-Who are you?

39:56.132 --> 39:58.831
I'm Peg.
That's my sister Bet.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.660
That's our friend Vikki.
We have got passes.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.019
Get a hold of yourself, woman.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.979
Cell seven.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.111
Come on.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.160
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

40:26.989 --> 40:29.383
Where Alph,
the sacred river, ran

40:29.514 --> 40:31.559
Through caverns
measureless to man

40:31.690 --> 40:33.431
In Xanadu did Kubla...

40:34.693 --> 40:36.782
Bloody hell.

40:36.912 --> 40:40.089
State of you.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.961
Don't worry, love.
We're here to help.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.226
What are you doing here?

40:46.356 --> 40:48.402
Well, His Lordship said
to send you his deepest love,

40:48.533 --> 40:51.231
and he's very sorry
for wronging you so cruelly.

40:51.361 --> 40:53.712
"Fondest love,"
not "deepest love."

40:53.842 --> 40:56.062
Whatever.
Fondest love, then.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.281
Memory like an elephant,
that one.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.458
Anyway, come on, love.

41:00.588 --> 41:03.069
-Where are we going?
-Don't worry, duck.

41:03.199 --> 41:04.723
We're getting you out of here.

41:04.853 --> 41:05.985
Now, put this on.

41:09.118 --> 41:10.859
And keep your head down.

41:13.079 --> 41:15.647
Oh, that's Vikki.

41:15.777 --> 41:16.735
She's our hostage.

41:16.865 --> 41:18.084
Hello.

41:18.214 --> 41:19.128
Hello, Vikki.

41:19.259 --> 41:21.000
Come on.

41:29.878 --> 41:31.184
Bet, this way.

41:42.456 --> 41:43.762
Come on.

41:43.892 --> 41:45.633
In here.

41:52.422 --> 41:53.641
Bet?

41:53.772 --> 41:54.816
Shh!

42:05.087 --> 42:06.785
I remember you.

42:08.961 --> 42:11.703
You're Esme's bloke.

42:11.833 --> 42:13.356
-What's his name?
Alfie.

42:13.487 --> 42:15.228
Alfie. That's right.

42:16.490 --> 42:18.318
And the whole gang.

42:18.448 --> 42:20.799
Jock.

42:20.929 --> 42:22.583
Fit Yank.

42:23.845 --> 42:25.891
Hello. I don't know you.

42:26.021 --> 42:27.762
Um, hi.

42:27.893 --> 42:29.372
How you all keeping? All right?

42:29.503 --> 42:31.331
Yeah, mustn't grumble.

42:31.461 --> 42:33.202
Peg, you remember Esme's
young man and his friends.

42:33.333 --> 42:34.943
How do?

42:35.074 --> 42:38.164
Not good enough for her,
mind, but...

42:38.294 --> 42:40.253
-nice enough chap.
-Dr. Gaunt.

42:40.383 --> 42:43.082
-Long time.
-Indeed.

42:43.212 --> 42:44.736
Hey, Doc. You did some
gallus needlework, by the way.

42:44.866 --> 42:46.172
Held up nicely.

42:46.302 --> 42:47.434
-Thank you.
-Oh, very kind.

42:47.565 --> 42:48.914
Well, this is all wonderful.

42:49.044 --> 42:50.829
Can we get some help here?

42:50.959 --> 42:52.700
There's a key right there
on that hook.

42:52.831 --> 42:54.572
Oh, right. Will do.

43:06.322 --> 43:07.933
"Thank you" would be nice.

43:08.063 --> 43:10.457
Thank you, ma'am.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.155
They've gone. Let's go.

43:13.286 --> 43:16.463
-Nice to see you again, Alfie.
-You, too.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.857
-Don't tell anyone you saw us.
-Hey, wait a minute.

43:18.987 --> 43:20.293
You've got weapons.
You could help us.

43:20.423 --> 43:22.077
Already did, didn't we?

43:22.208 --> 43:23.339
Well, can we at least have
one of your guns?

43:23.470 --> 43:25.254
Uh, not on your nelly.
We'll need these.

43:25.385 --> 43:27.430
Ladies, we are trying to stop
a terrible war crime.

43:27.561 --> 43:29.519
Good lads.

43:29.650 --> 43:31.391
-Best of luck.
Hang on.

43:31.521 --> 43:33.698
-A-Are you talking
about Stormcloud?
-Yeah.

43:33.828 --> 43:35.743
-Yeah, ladies, perhaps we...
-Never mind what they're doing.

43:35.874 --> 43:36.875
We're busy.

43:37.005 --> 43:39.268
Bet.

43:39.399 --> 43:40.748
What would Esme say
if she was here?

43:44.534 --> 43:47.015
So, how you been keeping,
anyway?

43:47.146 --> 43:49.278
Oh, on top of the world, me.

43:52.717 --> 43:55.633
I was that bereft
when Esme died, but...

43:57.417 --> 43:58.984
I found true love again.

43:59.114 --> 44:00.986
Nice.

44:01.116 --> 44:02.596
Wish I could say the same thing.

44:02.727 --> 44:04.859
You'll be all right.

44:04.990 --> 44:06.208
You've got height.

44:06.339 --> 44:08.036
Good head of hair.

44:17.393 --> 44:18.351
Now you've got a gun.

44:19.961 --> 44:21.049
-Thanks.

44:21.180 --> 44:23.138
No bother.

44:23.269 --> 44:24.923
Good luck.

44:25.053 --> 44:26.359
You, too.

44:28.187 --> 44:30.276
Come here. Give us a hug.

44:45.334 --> 44:47.162
Nice lad, that Alfie.

44:47.293 --> 44:50.078
For a squaddie.

44:52.080 --> 44:53.473
Hello, ladies.

44:53.603 --> 44:56.041
Oh, thank goodness you found us.

44:56.171 --> 44:57.477
-We're ever so lost.
-Yeah, it looks like.

44:57.607 --> 44:59.609
Who are you?

44:59.740 --> 45:02.134
Visitors. We have passes.

45:02.264 --> 45:04.092
Not for this section, you don't.

45:04.223 --> 45:06.138
Nobody does.

45:06.268 --> 45:07.269
Mm-hmm.
-I'm sorry, Miss DuFrench.

45:07.400 --> 45:08.227
I didn't see you there.

45:08.357 --> 45:09.968
Hello.

45:10.098 --> 45:11.360
Uh, looking for the penthouse,
I expect.

45:11.491 --> 45:13.319
-Yes. Penthouse.
-Yes.

45:13.449 --> 45:14.581
Could you show us?

45:14.712 --> 45:16.452
Oh. Right this way, ladies.

45:39.998 --> 45:41.869
Fuck.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.132
Oh, for fuck's sake.

45:46.221 --> 45:47.309
Such power.

45:48.528 --> 45:50.443
Such beauty.

45:56.841 --> 45:59.017
We live in an age of miracles,
Mr. Pennyworth.

46:00.975 --> 46:02.629
I dare say, sir.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.762
Powerful, useful miracles.

46:08.548 --> 46:10.332
And there's more to come.

46:12.465 --> 46:14.423
Science will grant us
amazing powers.

46:16.643 --> 46:19.080
Powers we cannot even imagine.

46:21.213 --> 46:23.955
A bright future awaits us,
Mr. Pennyworth.

46:24.085 --> 46:25.913
Indeed.

46:28.568 --> 46:30.962
Are you ready to do
what needs to be done?

46:31.092 --> 46:32.441
I must be sure.

46:38.534 --> 46:41.015
I don't like deception, sir,

46:41.146 --> 46:43.061
but what needs doing...

46:44.497 --> 46:45.846
...must be done.

46:49.328 --> 46:52.200
You're a good man
and a fine patriot.

46:52.331 --> 46:54.550
Miss Dixon,
have the League prisoners

46:54.681 --> 46:56.422
brought up here immediately.

47:08.086 --> 47:10.175
Th-Thank you, Riley.

47:10.305 --> 47:12.003
Uh, we'll tell his nibs
you were most helpful.

47:12.133 --> 47:13.091
You're very welcome.

47:19.184 --> 47:21.012
Well done, pet.

47:21.142 --> 47:22.448
You live another day.

47:29.107 --> 47:31.022
Commendable.

47:31.152 --> 47:34.329
You chaps keep trying.

47:34.460 --> 47:37.115
I'll take a man with grit
over a smart-ass every time.

47:37.245 --> 47:38.159
Isn't that right,
Mr. Pennyworth?

47:38.290 --> 47:39.726
It is, sir.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.120
Uh, how you doing, Mr. P.?

47:42.250 --> 47:43.904
-Keeping well, eh?
-Well enough.

47:44.035 --> 47:46.080
For fuck's sake, Dad,
can't you see this man's a twat?

47:46.211 --> 47:47.516
Show some respect!

47:49.257 --> 47:52.521
We're not in one
of your squaddie pubs.

47:52.652 --> 47:55.133
He's a twat, and this whole
Raven Union bollocks is a joke.

47:56.569 --> 47:58.092
Fuck do you want?

47:58.223 --> 48:01.182
-Fuck off.

48:03.489 --> 48:04.882
Now, gentlemen...

48:07.319 --> 48:09.016
...there's a bright side
to your situation.

48:10.539 --> 48:12.367
You all have something to offer.

48:12.498 --> 48:14.065
Dr. Fox...

48:16.458 --> 48:19.461
...you might choose to go
back to work in the lab for us.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.683
There'd be restrictions
on your freedom, of course,

48:23.813 --> 48:25.554
but you'd be comfortable.

48:25.685 --> 48:27.861
And if I don't choose
to go back?

48:27.992 --> 48:29.907
The world will move on
without you.

48:31.647 --> 48:33.736
Mr. Wayne...

48:33.867 --> 48:35.869
you could be
an excellent bargaining chip.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.525
You might make
a recorded statement,

48:39.655 --> 48:42.006
detailing your work
as an American spy.

48:42.136 --> 48:43.224
My answer is no.

48:45.183 --> 48:46.488
As you like.

48:50.057 --> 48:54.192
Mr. MacDougal,
I think I know your answer.

48:54.322 --> 48:56.411
You've not told me
what I'd be useful for yet.

48:56.542 --> 48:58.587
Mm. Soldiering, naturally.

48:58.718 --> 49:01.329
Ah, no, no, thanks.

49:01.460 --> 49:03.114
If it was pissing
on your mother,

49:03.244 --> 49:04.724
I'd be up for that.

49:10.556 --> 49:11.600
Very well.

49:11.731 --> 49:13.124
-Sir.
-Hmm?

49:15.082 --> 49:18.520
May I have a few words
in private with my son?

49:18.651 --> 49:21.523
Perhaps I can yet
persuade him to see sense.

49:21.654 --> 49:23.090
-Don't bother.
-Please.

49:25.310 --> 49:27.442
Of course, my friend.

49:27.573 --> 49:29.140
As long as you like.

49:30.924 --> 49:33.622
I'm rather peckish.

49:33.753 --> 49:37.409
I shall have a snack while you
make one last push, eh?

49:41.543 --> 49:43.676
Gentlemen.

49:45.808 --> 49:48.115
Back off!

49:52.380 --> 49:53.773
Don't waste
your fucking batteries.

49:53.903 --> 49:55.514
Son.

49:56.732 --> 49:58.038
Look at me.

50:02.956 --> 50:05.306
Do you really think
your mother would forgive me

50:05.437 --> 50:06.525
if she saw me again?

50:08.483 --> 50:09.615
Who gives a toss?

50:09.745 --> 50:11.312
I do.

50:13.923 --> 50:16.187
I want to see her again
before I die.

50:18.580 --> 50:19.668
I love her.

50:22.584 --> 50:23.629
I love you, son.

50:26.936 --> 50:28.895
Hard cheese for you, then.

50:29.026 --> 50:30.636
We'll both be dead by tonight.

50:35.293 --> 50:37.034
Come closer.

50:44.780 --> 50:46.434
There's a gun in my left pocket.

50:49.568 --> 50:51.570
Don't just stare at me, boy.

51:02.581 --> 51:04.800
If you've got a volume knob,

51:04.931 --> 51:06.585
turn it down.

51:14.506 --> 51:17.900
Well, I suppose this is
goodbye, Prime Minister.

51:18.031 --> 51:19.554
Yes, Your Majesty.

51:26.518 --> 51:28.085
You know...

51:30.913 --> 51:32.219
...if things were different...

51:33.612 --> 51:35.222
I know.

51:56.025 --> 51:57.853
I'll call you
when I get to Paris.

52:35.978 --> 52:37.763
Excuse me, sir.

52:37.893 --> 52:39.547
Line two.

52:43.072 --> 52:44.639
Hello?

52:44.770 --> 52:46.511
Hello, Mr. Aziz.

52:48.165 --> 52:49.862
You're never gonna guess what.

53:56.929 --> 53:59.540
