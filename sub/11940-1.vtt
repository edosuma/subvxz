we can express ourselves.

that are amusing

35:50.066 --> 35:52.444
as a sort of a light entertainment,

35:52.527 --> 35:57.032

in scope and feeling

go, uh, hit some night spots?

39:46.678 --> 39:49.013
Well... <i>Melorra,</i>

39:50.265 --> 39:52.475
I'll be right back. I'm gonna get a beer.

39:52.559 --> 39:54.894
No, Enid, wait.

39:54.978 --> 39:56.813
Hey, that's all right.

40:01.025 --> 40:04.237
It has a large center hole
and a hair crack.

40:04.320 --> 40:07.699
But the crack is so tight,
it's completely inaudible.

40:07.782 --> 40:11.411
But a tight hair crack
is just that ‒ a crack.

40:11.494 --> 40:13.913
I don't collect cracked records.

40:13.997 --> 40:17.500
I only pay premium on mint records.

40:17.584 --> 40:20.795
Seymour, you know that. Please.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.966
(clears throat)

40:25.049 --> 40:28.511
So what was all that about
enlarged holes and tight cracks?

40:30.430 --> 40:34.058
I ‒ (chuckles) I didn't think you would
have any interest in this get-together.

40:34.142 --> 40:37.186
If you would have told me you were coming,
I would have warned you.

40:37.270 --> 40:39.272
It's not like a real party or anything.

40:39.355 --> 40:41.482
Yeah, you're right about that.

40:41.566 --> 40:43.860
So, is this your record collection?

40:43.943 --> 40:46.863
Oh, God, no.
This is just junk I have for sale.

40:46.946 --> 40:50.116
- The record room is off-limits.
- Really?

40:50.199 --> 40:52.744
♪♪ (jazz continues)

40:53.828 --> 40:55.455
Here.

41:01.044 --> 41:03.004
Are all these records?

41:03.087 --> 41:06.883
Yeah, I've got about,
uh 1,500 78s at this point.

41:06.966 --> 41:09.969
I've tried to pare down my collection
to just the essential.

41:15.558 --> 41:17.310
Look at this room.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.898
This is like my dream room.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.943
Look at all this stuff.

41:29.405 --> 41:31.491
You are like the luckiest guy
in the world.

41:32.575 --> 41:34.619
I would kill to have stuff like this.

41:34.702 --> 41:37.121
Please. Go ahead and kill me.

41:37.205 --> 41:39.874
Oh, come on. What are you talking about?

41:39.957 --> 41:43.002
Well, do you think it's healthy
to obsessively collect things?

41:44.379 --> 41:47.256
You can't connect with other people,
so you fill your life with stuff.

41:47.340 --> 41:51.010
I'm just like all the rest of
these pathetic collector losers.

41:51.969 --> 41:54.889
No, you're not.
You're a cool guy, Seymour.

41:54.972 --> 41:58.643
If I'm so cool, how come I haven't
had a girlfriend in four years?

41:59.560 --> 42:01.854
I can't even remember
the last time a girl talked to me.

42:01.938 --> 42:03.564
I'm talking to you.

42:03.648 --> 42:06.484
I'd bet there are tons of women
who'd go out with you in a minute.

42:06.567 --> 42:09.779
- I know I could get you a date in two seconds.
- Good luck.

42:09.862 --> 42:11.906
I mean it. You leave everything to me.

42:11.989 --> 42:13.991
I'm gonna be your own
personal dating service.

42:14.075 --> 42:15.660
Yeah, well, we should get back.

42:15.743 --> 42:18.621
By the end of the summer,
you're gonna be up to your neck in pussy.

42:19.497 --> 42:20.581
Jesus!

42:21.457 --> 42:24.210
ENID: What about her?
Would you go out with her?

42:24.293 --> 42:26.170
What kind of a question is that?

42:26.254 --> 42:30.842
It's totally irrelevant because a girl like that
would never be caught dead with me.

42:30.925 --> 42:33.845
Yeah, but put that aside for now.
Would <i>you</i> go out with her?

42:33.928 --> 42:37.098
- I really didn't get a good look at her.
- Yes, you did.

42:37.181 --> 42:39.100
Whoa. What about her?

42:39.183 --> 42:40.893
Are you into girls with big tits?

42:40.977 --> 42:42.478
SEYMOUR: Jesus!

42:43.980 --> 42:46.649
I mean, as long as she's not
a complete imbecile

42:46.733 --> 42:49.610
and she's even remotely attractive...

42:50.528 --> 42:52.029
Hey, look, there's Norman.

42:52.113 --> 42:53.531
Hi, Norman.

42:55.825 --> 42:59.829
We need to find a place where you can go
to meet women who share your interests.

42:59.912 --> 43:02.749
Well, maybe I don't want to meet
someone who shares my interests.

43:02.832 --> 43:04.375
I hate my interests.

43:04.459 --> 43:08.463
Yeah. Just list your five main interests
in order of importance.

43:08.546 --> 43:11.549
(sighs) I'd have to put traditional jazz,

43:11.632 --> 43:13.926
blues, uh, and then ragtime
at the top of the list.

43:14.010 --> 43:17.972
Right, so let's just say music.
That way we only use up one.

43:18.973 --> 43:20.683
All right. Um ‒

43:20.767 --> 43:23.728
Can we go in here for a second?
Just ‒ Just for a second.

43:23.811 --> 43:25.813
(door bell chimes)

43:26.731 --> 43:28.941
- ENID: Hi, Josh.
- Hi.

43:29.942 --> 43:32.111
Just stopping by to say hi.

43:33.154 --> 43:34.280
Yeah?

43:34.363 --> 43:36.741
This is my friend, Seymour.

43:38.493 --> 43:40.995
(girl crying)

43:41.078 --> 43:43.664
Okay. Well, we'll see you later, Josh.

43:43.748 --> 43:47.001
OWNER: Josh, what you goddamn doing?
Clean up that fucking mess!

43:47.084 --> 43:49.045
- Jesus!
- (crying continues)

43:49.128 --> 43:51.798
So... was that ‒ was that your boyfriend?

43:51.881 --> 43:53.800
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend.

43:53.883 --> 43:56.594
He's just this guy
that Becky and I like to torture.

43:56.677 --> 43:58.596
But do you ‒ Are you ‒ Are you going ‒

43:58.679 --> 44:02.391
Oh, my God, we have to go in here.
Come on.

44:02.475 --> 44:03.893
Yeah, sure, very funny.

44:03.976 --> 44:05.436
Come on. Please?

44:05.520 --> 44:08.898
Becky and I have been dying to go in here,
but we can never find any boys to take us.

44:08.981 --> 44:11.275
- I would really rather not.
- Come on. Please?

44:11.359 --> 44:13.903
- Just for a minute. It'll be a riot.
- I don't think so.

44:13.986 --> 44:15.988
Please. Please.

44:29.669 --> 44:32.213
Oh, my God. Look at all these creeps.

44:32.296 --> 44:33.673
Hey, hey. Shh.

44:35.925 --> 44:37.802
- Okay, can we go?
- (laughing)

44:39.220 --> 44:41.472
This place is a total riot.

44:49.188 --> 44:51.732
- What are you doing? Hey ‒
- (laughing continues)

44:51.816 --> 44:54.193
Oh, my God!

44:54.277 --> 44:56.571
Who... Who would actually
have sex with this thing?

44:56.654 --> 44:58.072
Come on, put it...

45:00.157 --> 45:02.702
Oh. <i>Corporate Slut</i>. Sophisticated.

45:02.785 --> 45:04.579
(laughing)

45:04.662 --> 45:06.664
Come on. Can we go? Let's go.

45:07.665 --> 45:10.835
Seymour! You have to lend me
the money to buy this!

45:13.379 --> 45:15.506
I don't really have a lot of money
on me right now.

45:15.590 --> 45:17.174
Come on, Seymour, please.

45:17.258 --> 45:19.594
I don't want this showing up
on a credit card statement.

45:19.677 --> 45:22.263
- I'll get put on some weird mailing list.
- It's not that much. Please.

45:22.346 --> 45:23.556
That's not the point.

45:23.639 --> 45:25.850
Give me all your money, bitch!

45:25.933 --> 45:28.853
- Where did you get that?
- You'll never believe it.

45:28.936 --> 45:31.272
- Guess.
- Um...

45:31.355 --> 45:32.648
Where?

45:32.732 --> 45:34.942
Anthony's.

45:35.026 --> 45:37.778
- No way! When?
- Just now. I went with Seymour.

45:37.862 --> 45:39.614
- You cunt.
- (laughing)

45:39.697 --> 45:41.657
Excuse me.

45:41.741 --> 45:44.243
I can't read the trivia question.

45:47.747 --> 45:50.750
"Where on the human body
is the Douglas Pouch located?"

45:50.833 --> 45:52.043
(chuckles)

45:55.755 --> 45:57.465
Oh, God.

45:59.634 --> 46:02.345
(coffee pouring)

46:02.428 --> 46:03.429
(beeps)

46:03.512 --> 46:06.307
Slightly below the uterus...

46:06.933 --> 46:09.268
on a female.

46:17.234 --> 46:19.820
- Wow.
- He does that every single day.

46:19.904 --> 46:23.115
(clears throat)
I'll have a decaf mocha to go.

46:23.199 --> 46:25.117
Mm-hmm. One decaf mocha.

46:25.201 --> 46:26.786
- MAN: Decaf mocha.
- Can I get you a ‒

46:26.869 --> 46:28.871
No, I do not want a biscotti with that.

46:28.955 --> 46:32.041
- (steamed milk hissing)
- (register clicking)

46:32.124 --> 46:35.878
God. How can you stand all these assholes?

46:35.962 --> 46:40.007
Some people are okay. But mostly
I feel like poisoning everybody.

46:40.758 --> 46:42.802
At least the wheelchair guy
is entertaining.

46:42.885 --> 46:45.972
He doesn't even need that wheelchair.
He's just totally lazy.

46:46.055 --> 46:47.682
(laughs) That rules.

46:47.765 --> 46:50.142
No, it really doesn't.

46:50.226 --> 46:55.231
You'll see. You get totally sick of
all the creeps and losers and weirdos.

46:55.314 --> 46:57.024
But those are our people.

46:57.108 --> 46:58.317
Yeah, well...

47:01.612 --> 47:03.614
So when are you gonna get a job?

47:06.492 --> 47:09.870
I'm working on it.
Got a few leads. You know.

47:09.954 --> 47:12.540
Don't worry about it.
I'll get a job next week.

47:13.165 --> 47:15.418
God, I can't believe
you went to Anthony's without me.

47:20.297 --> 47:24.176
Oh, uh, sweetie? H-Honey.
Would you come in here for a minute?

47:27.096 --> 47:29.682
Sweetie, um, you remember Ma ‒ Maxine.

47:31.976 --> 47:34.812
Mmm. Hi, Enid.

47:34.895 --> 47:36.230
Hi.

47:38.232 --> 47:40.151
I'm gonna go to bed. I'm really tired.

47:40.234 --> 47:43.029
Well, honey, I made spaghetti.
You don't want some?

47:43.112 --> 47:45.573
No, I have to get up early
for class tomorrow.

47:45.656 --> 47:48.617
It's really quite something
to see you all grown up like this, Enid.

47:51.829 --> 47:54.373
I'd love to know what you're doing now.

47:54.457 --> 47:58.002
I can't help but feel I had some
small part in how you turned out.

48:01.213 --> 48:03.132
What are you studying?

48:03.215 --> 48:05.801
You were always such a smart little girl.

48:07.887 --> 48:11.098
I'm taking a remedial high school art class
for fuck-ups and retards.

48:11.182 --> 48:12.433
(sighs)

48:12.516 --> 48:13.893
(uncomfortable chuckle)

48:14.602 --> 48:16.896
Who is this? Enid?

48:17.855 --> 48:20.399
- It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
- (class chuckles)

48:20.483 --> 48:23.986
And what was your reason for
choosing him as your subject?

48:25.654 --> 48:28.240
I don't know. I just like Don Knotts.

48:28.324 --> 48:29.658
(girl scoffs)

48:29.742 --> 48:31.327
Interesting.

48:32.578 --> 48:34.830
Well, what do we have here, Margaret?

48:34.914 --> 48:37.374
- It's a tampon in a teacup.
- (class giggles)

48:37.458 --> 48:39.376
I can see that.

48:39.460 --> 48:43.756
Now, what can you tell us about it?
First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?

48:43.839 --> 48:46.050
It's a found object.

48:46.133 --> 48:48.135
That's where an artist
takes an ordinary object

48:48.219 --> 48:51.222
and places it in an artistic context,
and thus it becomes art.

48:52.014 --> 48:55.976
But what can you tell us about it
in regard to your artistic intent?

48:57.019 --> 49:00.397
Well, I guess I see the teacup

49:00.481 --> 49:02.191
as a symbol for womanhood,

49:02.274 --> 49:04.693
such as tea parties in the olden days.

49:04.777 --> 49:09.031
But instead of tea, I was trying
to confront people with this, like ‒

49:09.115 --> 49:12.952
This shocking image
of repressed femininity.

49:13.035 --> 49:14.954
Right! Exactly.

49:15.037 --> 49:18.666
Well, I think it's a really wonderful piece,

49:18.749 --> 49:21.043
and it illustrates perfectly
what I was saying

49:21.127 --> 49:26.006
about not being afraid
to use controversial imagery.

49:27.091 --> 49:28.759
Oh! (chuckles)

49:28.843 --> 49:32.138
- Well, this looks like the work of Phillip.
- (class laughs)

49:36.809 --> 49:38.561
Do you see that guy over there?

49:40.020 --> 49:43.357
- Which one?
- The blond guy over there.

49:46.026 --> 49:48.279
He gives me, like, a total boner.

49:48.362 --> 49:50.656
He's, like, the biggest idiot of all time.

49:50.739 --> 49:52.741
BOY: You guys up
for some reggae tonight?

49:54.368 --> 49:56.036
Okay, you're right.

49:58.414 --> 50:01.625
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
from sexual frustration.

50:01.709 --> 50:04.879
(laughs) Then you haven't heard of
the miracle of masturbation.

50:10.342 --> 50:11.844
Heads up.

50:13.220 --> 50:14.763
Hey.

50:14.847 --> 50:17.558
My band's playing here on Friday night.

50:17.641 --> 50:20.394
There's gonna be a bunch
of cool bands playing and stuff.

50:20.477 --> 50:24.064
And you don't have to pay...
if you show them this flyer at the door.

50:24.815 --> 50:26.817
You should come check it out.

50:30.154 --> 50:31.488
Which band is yours?

50:31.572 --> 50:33.782
It's Alien Autopsy.

50:33.866 --> 50:36.118
Oh. Bitchin'.

50:37.036 --> 50:40.080
Yeah, well, maybe I'll see you there.

50:40.956 --> 50:42.333
Yeah, thanks.

50:45.669 --> 50:48.130
- God, what a dork.
- You're just jealous.

50:48.214 --> 50:49.757
(scoffs) Trust me.

50:49.840 --> 50:53.010
At this point, I'm past the fact that every
single guy likes you better than me.

50:53.093 --> 50:56.013
Oh, face it. You just hate every
single guy on the face of the earth.

50:56.096 --> 50:58.015
That's not true.

50:58.098 --> 51:03.354
I just hate all these extroverted,
obnoxious, pseudo-Bohemian losers.

I brought it so he can autograph it.

51:38.180 --> 51:41.809
He's gonna be amazed to see it.
It's one of only two known copies.

51:42.726 --> 51:45.729

can get you a job at Computer Station.

You know, if ‒ if ‒ if ‒

01:16:55.905 --> 01:16:57.907
If that's ‒ Mm-hmm.

01:17:04.121 --> 01:17:06.332
(chattering)

01:17:10.085 --> 01:17:12.713
- WOMAN: Well, yes.
- WOMAN #2: I don't see...

01:17:12.797 --> 01:17:15.382
(chattering continues)

01:17:15.466 --> 01:17:17.384
WOMAN #3: Awful! Just awful.

01:17:17.468 --> 01:17:20.513
I will take care of it, I promise you.
I will handle it.

01:17:20.596 --> 01:17:22.807
- This is not ‒
- Kept thinking of a nuclear power plant.

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:24.892
- Excuse me.
- It's called <i>Wasteland.</i>

01:17:24.975 --> 01:17:27.603
I'm sorry. I need to speak
with her for a second.

01:17:27.686 --> 01:17:29.313
- Well, enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:31.065
Yes, what is it, Phyllis?

01:17:31.148 --> 01:17:34.026
I am sorry, but you are simply going
to have to remove that painting.

01:17:34.109 --> 01:17:36.028
Several of the parents
have complained about it already.

01:17:36.111 --> 01:17:38.197
Well, I will do no such thing.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.116
Then I guess I'm going to go over there
and take it down myself.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.870
I think we should give the artist
a chance to talk with the parents

01:17:44.954 --> 01:17:47.122
about her intentions with this piece.

01:17:47.206 --> 01:17:51.669
We should be promoting discussion
as a solution instead of censorship.

01:17:51.752 --> 01:17:53.295
- Censorship?
- Yes.

01:17:53.379 --> 01:17:57.758
Oh, that is such a big word for you,
Roberta. Excuse me.

01:17:57.842 --> 01:18:00.427
- Do not touch that piece.
- Okay, I have a solution.

01:18:00.511 --> 01:18:03.305
- Thank you, everyone, for your patience.
- Enid?

01:18:03.389 --> 01:18:05.933
- I am going to take it down.
- Margaret?

01:18:06.016 --> 01:18:08.561
- Have you seen Enid?
- I don't think she's even here.

01:18:08.644 --> 01:18:10.563
- You're kidding.
- (camera shutter clicks)

01:18:11.939 --> 01:18:14.108
- All right. There we go.
- MAN: Thank you very much.

01:18:14.191 --> 01:18:15.192
WOMAN: Bravo.

01:18:15.276 --> 01:18:17.236
MAN: Just take it away. Excellent.

01:18:25.452 --> 01:18:26.620
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. What's up?

01:18:26.704 --> 01:18:28.956
So, um... Excuse me.

01:18:29.707 --> 01:18:33.335
So there's this stupid art show I'm going
to tonight, and I want you to be my date.

01:18:33.419 --> 01:18:36.088
- There's something I want to show you.
- Uh, yeah.

01:18:36.171 --> 01:18:38.465
- I don't think I should.
- Of course you should.

01:18:38.549 --> 01:18:40.968
I'm already a million hours late. Come on.

01:18:41.051 --> 01:18:43.053
I better not.

01:18:44.221 --> 01:18:47.641
Okay. Well, forget the art show.
Let's do something else then.

01:18:47.725 --> 01:18:50.269
I really wish I could, Enid,

01:18:50.352 --> 01:18:55.190
but... you know, Dana just
got out of a really bad relationship,

01:18:55.274 --> 01:18:57.860
and I don't want her
to have the wrong idea, you know?

01:18:57.943 --> 01:18:59.945
Hey. What's happening?

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:05.576
Where'd you get those pants?

01:19:07.578 --> 01:19:09.288
They were a present from Dana.

01:19:09.788 --> 01:19:11.624
You like them? They a good fit?

01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:16.462
Yeah, whatever.
I mean, what do I know about clothes?

01:19:16.545 --> 01:19:19.089
It's nice to have somebody
do all the work for me.

01:19:24.637 --> 01:19:26.305
JOE: I'll just be in my room.

01:19:28.974 --> 01:19:33.354
What's her deal anyway? Did she actually
tell you that you can't see me anymore?

01:19:33.437 --> 01:19:37.775
No. No, I mean... not exactly.

01:19:37.858 --> 01:19:40.069
I mean, she just, uh...

01:19:42.738 --> 01:19:45.991
She just doesn't understand
how I would know someone like you.

01:19:46.075 --> 01:19:48.285
What does that mean? Someone like me?

01:19:48.369 --> 01:19:51.455
Just someone so young.

01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:59.588
Don't worry. I won't bother you anymore.

01:20:48.804 --> 01:20:51.098
Hi.

01:20:51.181 --> 01:20:52.683
Hello.

01:20:54.101 --> 01:20:55.978
Do you remember me?

01:20:57.855 --> 01:20:59.857
Sure. Sure.

01:21:05.696 --> 01:21:09.575
You know, you're like the only person
in this world that I can count on.

01:21:10.617 --> 01:21:14.246
Because, no matter what,
I know you'll always be here.

01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:20.502
Well, that's what you think.

01:21:22.463 --> 01:21:24.381
I'm leaving town.

01:21:29.928 --> 01:21:32.306
ENID: Where are we?
This is such a weird neighborhood.

01:21:32.389 --> 01:21:34.767
REBECCA: This is a totally normal,
average neighborhood.

01:21:35.559 --> 01:21:39.813
- 3128. Must be it.
- Great.

01:21:41.607 --> 01:21:44.985
What? What's wrong with it?
It looks totally normal.

01:21:45.069 --> 01:21:48.155
- What? I said "great."
- Yeah, I can tell you really love it.

01:21:48.238 --> 01:21:50.074
(scoffs) What am I supposed to say?

01:21:50.157 --> 01:21:53.869
"Gee, I can't wait to live in some depressing
shithole out in the middle of nowhere"?

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:55.954
You hate every single place
that we look at.

01:21:56.038 --> 01:22:00.209
I mean, why don't you just tell me that
you don't want to live with me anymore?

01:22:02.377 --> 01:22:06.381
Because you'll totally freak out
and act like a psycho about it.

01:22:06.465 --> 01:22:09.510
What? You're the psycho.

01:22:09.593 --> 01:22:12.638
I mean, you've totally ignored me
ever since high school ended.

01:22:13.639 --> 01:22:16.683
You're the one who's still living out
some stupid seventh-grade fantasy.

01:22:16.767 --> 01:22:19.478
- Your own apartment.
- Fuck you.

01:22:19.561 --> 01:22:22.648
Have fun living with your dad
for the rest of your life.

01:22:23.649 --> 01:22:25.484
(crying)

01:22:28.821 --> 01:22:31.323
God. Fuck you too.

01:22:32.658 --> 01:22:34.451
(knocking)

01:22:34.535 --> 01:22:36.161
- Pumpkin?
- (knocking)

01:22:36.954 --> 01:22:38.789
Pump ‒ Pumpkin?

01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:43.085
Honey?

01:22:43.168 --> 01:22:45.129
What's wrong?

01:22:49.091 --> 01:22:50.092
Nothing.

01:22:50.175 --> 01:22:54.596
Because, honey, if something's wrong,
I'd love it if we could talk about it.

01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:59.643
It's nothing. It's just some hormonal thing.
Don't worry about it.

01:22:59.726 --> 01:23:03.689
Okay, because, you know,
I have some very, very important news,

01:23:03.772 --> 01:23:07.609
uh, to talk about and, you know,
if you're not feeling well,

01:23:07.693 --> 01:23:10.195
we could just do this some other time.

01:23:12.406 --> 01:23:13.949
What?

01:23:15.784 --> 01:23:18.787
Well, Maxine and I have been seeing
a lot of each other.

01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:22.708
And we were thinking
it might be really best for all of us

01:23:22.791 --> 01:23:25.169
if, at the end of the summer,

01:23:25.252 --> 01:23:27.045
she came here to live with us.

01:23:27.129 --> 01:23:30.215
And, you know, we could really
just see how we got along together

01:23:30.299 --> 01:23:32.134
and see if this is...

01:23:32.217 --> 01:23:34.344
(sobbing)

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.566
ROBERTA: Is this your first death mask?

01:23:47.649 --> 01:23:49.484
(man laughing)

01:23:49.568 --> 01:23:52.571
- All artists have to suffer.
- Um, hi.

01:23:52.654 --> 01:23:54.907
Oh, just a minute.

01:23:55.824 --> 01:23:59.578
I, uh ‒ I brought the application
for the Art Academy.

01:23:59.661 --> 01:24:01.914
I just hope it's not too late.

01:24:03.332 --> 01:24:06.210
I am so sorry about what happened, Enid.

01:24:07.461 --> 01:24:08.712
What do you mean?

01:24:08.795 --> 01:24:11.882
Well, the whole business
with the art show and the newspaper.

01:24:11.965 --> 01:24:14.509
- It's just absolutely...
- Hmm?

01:24:14.593 --> 01:24:19.223
Well, they're forcing me to give you
a non-passing grade in the class.

01:24:21.058 --> 01:24:23.894
Can't I still get a scholarship
to the Art Academy?

01:24:23.977 --> 01:24:25.520
Well, I'm sorry, Enid.

01:24:25.604 --> 01:24:29.566
- Can you help me out here?
- I ‒ I can't breathe under this mask.

01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:32.527
That's fine, that's fine.
You just have to breathe. Don't worry about it.

01:24:32.611 --> 01:24:34.112
MAN: Okay.

01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:40.160
(knocking slowly)

01:24:51.713 --> 01:24:54.132
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:24:54.216 --> 01:24:56.260
I needed to see you.

01:24:56.343 --> 01:24:58.470
What's up?

01:24:58.553 --> 01:25:00.973
Can you at least let me in?

01:25:01.056 --> 01:25:03.058
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

01:25:04.309 --> 01:25:07.145
Look, I just need someone
to be nice to me for, like, five minutes,

01:25:07.229 --> 01:25:09.523
and then I swear
I'll leave you alone, okay?

01:25:10.148 --> 01:25:11.650
What's the matter?

01:25:13.652 --> 01:25:15.237
Do you have anything to drink?

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.906
Yeah. Well, there might be
some root beer in there.

01:25:19.491 --> 01:25:21.743
- What's this?
- That's Dana's.

01:25:21.827 --> 01:25:24.538
We're supposed to be saving it
for our two-month anniversary.

01:25:24.621 --> 01:25:27.833
You better not...

01:25:27.916 --> 01:25:29.584
(cork bouncing on floor)

01:25:30.252 --> 01:25:31.253
(sighs)

01:25:31.336 --> 01:25:33.255
♪♪ (instrumental)

01:25:33.338 --> 01:25:37.509
I mean, you like me, right, Seymour?

01:25:37.592 --> 01:25:39.469
- We're good friends, right?
- Yeah.

01:25:39.553 --> 01:25:41.263
Sure. Of course.

01:25:54.443 --> 01:25:56.111
What is this?

01:25:56.194 --> 01:26:00.365
Dana got it
when we went shopping for antiques.

01:26:01.491 --> 01:26:05.329
She said it didn't go with her stuff,
so she gave it to me.

01:26:05.412 --> 01:26:09.624
Said it would go better
with my old-time thingamajigs.

01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:15.130
Jesus. How can you stand her?

01:26:18.216 --> 01:26:22.804
How come in all that time I was trying to
get you a date, you never asked me out?

01:26:24.181 --> 01:26:25.682
You're a beautiful young girl.

01:26:25.766 --> 01:26:27.976
I couldn't imagine
you'd have any interest in me

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:31.813
except as an amusingly cranky
eccentric curiosity.

01:26:31.897 --> 01:26:34.775
At least you're not like
every other stupid guy in the world.

01:26:34.858 --> 01:26:37.861
All they care about is guitars or sports.

01:26:38.653 --> 01:26:40.155
I hate sports.

01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:48.538
Maybe I should just move in with you.

01:26:48.622 --> 01:26:53.543
You know, I could do the cooking
and dust your old records until I get a job.

01:26:59.758 --> 01:27:02.386
You know what
my number-one fantasy used to be?

01:27:04.221 --> 01:27:05.263
What?

01:27:06.264 --> 01:27:10.310
I used to think about, one day ‒
just not telling anyone

01:27:10.394 --> 01:27:12.562
and going off to some random place.

01:27:13.563 --> 01:27:15.273
And I'd just...

01:27:17.359 --> 01:27:18.860
disappear.

01:27:19.736 --> 01:27:22.030
And they'd never see me again.

01:27:22.114 --> 01:27:24.533
Do you ever think about stuff like that?

01:27:25.867 --> 01:27:28.286
I guess I probably did
when I was your age.

01:27:30.497 --> 01:27:33.125
You know what we should do?

01:27:33.208 --> 01:27:36.711
We should just get in your car right now
and just drive off,

01:27:36.795 --> 01:27:40.424
just find some totally new place
and start a whole new life.

01:27:41.174 --> 01:27:42.676
Fuck everybody.

01:27:43.927 --> 01:27:47.931
I'm, uh ‒ I'm not
in any good condition to drive.

01:27:48.765 --> 01:27:50.267
I'm serious.

01:27:51.268 --> 01:27:53.061
I'm just so sick of everybody.

01:27:53.603 --> 01:27:56.231
Why can't I just do what I want?

01:27:56.314 --> 01:27:58.275
What do you want?

01:28:00.444 --> 01:28:02.154
What do you want?

01:28:06.283 --> 01:28:07.909
Don't you like me?

01:28:26.261 --> 01:28:29.222
SEYMOUR: Boy, I never expected
anything like this to happen.

01:28:32.559 --> 01:28:35.353
Yeah, well, me neither.

01:28:35.437 --> 01:28:37.814
You must... You must know I always...

01:28:40.275 --> 01:28:43.445
Did you mean all that stuff
about moving in with me?

01:28:48.033 --> 01:28:50.160
I was just thinking out loud.

01:28:52.078 --> 01:28:56.541
I mean, you know,
you've got this thing with Dana,

01:28:56.625 --> 01:28:58.627
and I'm not gonna let you fuck that up.

01:28:58.710 --> 01:29:01.922
Yeah, but, I don't know. I just ‒

01:29:02.005 --> 01:29:03.507
Shh.

01:29:06.051 --> 01:29:08.261
I really need to get some sleep.

01:29:09.554 --> 01:29:11.056
Okay.

01:29:12.516 --> 01:29:14.017
Good night.

01:29:16.311 --> 01:29:17.812
(kisses)

01:29:25.862 --> 01:29:28.490
(traffic passing)

01:29:32.786 --> 01:29:34.287
Enid?

01:29:46.007 --> 01:29:48.426
Right. Oh, one second.

01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:50.887
- Seymour. Hi.
- Hi. Sorry.

01:29:50.971 --> 01:29:53.014
- Go ahead.
- We're almost done.

01:29:53.723 --> 01:29:57.894
Hi. Yeah. No, it's excluded.
They've already paid the earnest money.

01:29:59.229 --> 01:30:03.483
Well, let's see if they bring it up
if they notice it on the final walk-through.

01:30:03.567 --> 01:30:05.902
Right.

01:30:05.986 --> 01:30:08.405
Great. Sounds good.

01:30:09.614 --> 01:30:11.449
- (laughing) Yes!
- (laughing)

01:30:11.533 --> 01:30:13.159
- We did it.
- Great job.

01:30:13.243 --> 01:30:15.787
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of you.

01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:18.707
Well, I'll catch you guys later.
I'm gonna start the paperwork.

01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:19.916
Okay.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.501
- Hi!
- Hey.

01:30:23.211 --> 01:30:25.422
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Have a seat.

01:30:28.842 --> 01:30:30.343
So...

01:30:31.136 --> 01:30:33.096
What brings you down here?

01:30:33.179 --> 01:30:35.223
Um ‒ (clears throat)

01:30:35.307 --> 01:30:36.975
I just, uh,

01:30:37.058 --> 01:30:41.605
really feel like I, uh ‒
I need to say something to you.

01:30:41.688 --> 01:30:43.189
Um...

01:30:44.065 --> 01:30:46.234
I've never said this to anyone before.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:51.573
Believe me, I've stayed
in horrible relationships for years

01:30:51.656 --> 01:30:54.117
just so I wouldn't have to do this.

01:30:55.368 --> 01:30:57.704
What are you trying to say?

01:30:59.873 --> 01:31:04.002
I think maybe it's not such a good idea
that we keep going out.

01:31:05.045 --> 01:31:07.547
(phone rings)

01:31:11.176 --> 01:31:13.595

<i>Uh, Seymour here.</i>

01:31:19.601 --> 01:31:22.771
<i>Um... I really want to talk to you.</i>

01:31:23.688 --> 01:31:27.442
<i>I've been thinking about what you said
about moving in here, and, um</i> ‒

01:31:28.401 --> 01:31:31.363
<i>Um... Yeah, so just, uh...</i>

01:31:32.614 --> 01:31:35.784
<i>Um, give me a call when you get a chance.
Okay. Thanks. Bye.</i>

01:31:44.542 --> 01:31:45.669

01:31:46.336 --> 01:31:48.421
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other day.

01:31:48.505 --> 01:31:52.175
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I really do want to move in with you.

01:31:53.134 --> 01:31:54.928
Look, I don't know.

01:31:56.304 --> 01:31:59.849
I mean, I was thinking maybe
I should just live alone, you know?

01:31:59.933 --> 01:32:02.811
I've decided to rent that place
that we looked at.

01:32:03.812 --> 01:32:07.399
And, um, I start moving in next week.

01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:11.027
Please let me come with you. Please.

01:32:11.111 --> 01:32:14.030
Look, I don't know.
I don't think it's such a good idea.

01:32:14.114 --> 01:32:16.616
Of course it's a good idea. It's our plan.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.119
Yeah, but how are you gonna
pay rent and everything?

01:32:19.202 --> 01:32:23.623
- You know? You don't even have a job.
- I'll get a job tomorrow. I promise.

01:32:23.707 --> 01:32:26.668
Maxine said she could give me a job
at Computer Station.

01:32:27.502 --> 01:32:29.254
Please, Rebecca.

01:32:46.271 --> 01:32:48.106
Well, here's where the fun never stops.

01:32:48.189 --> 01:32:50.900
She could at least have the decency
to call me back.

01:32:50.984 --> 01:32:54.821
Wasted time trying to logically
figure out the female brain.

01:32:54.904 --> 01:32:57.073
That's for sure.

01:32:57.157 --> 01:32:59.826
- Maybe she got another boyfriend.
- (farts)

01:33:02.287 --> 01:33:04.122
Yeah, well, thanks for cheering me up.

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.325
Hey, look at it this way.

01:33:41.618 --> 01:33:43.286
At least things can't get any worse.

01:33:51.586 --> 01:33:53.087
Seymour.

01:33:53.171 --> 01:33:56.591
Just the man I want to see.
Step in here for a minute.

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.846
Have a seat.

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.059
What can you tell me about this, Seymour?

01:34:16.694 --> 01:34:18.321
So, what do you think?

01:34:20.532 --> 01:34:22.033
It's fine.

01:34:24.202 --> 01:34:25.912

01:34:25.995 --> 01:34:27.497
There.

That's all you're bringing?

01:34:33.586 --> 01:34:37.215
No, I'm gonna pack up the rest tonight.
I'll bring it over sometime tomorrow.

01:34:37.298 --> 01:34:38.800
What time?

01:34:39.634 --> 01:34:41.469
I don't know. Noon.

01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:44.973
All right, cool.
Just make sure you're here by then

01:34:45.056 --> 01:34:47.600
'cause we got a lot of stuff to do.

Oh, wait.

01:34:49.561 --> 01:34:52.272

Are you sure she wasn't there?

01:37:03.194 --> 01:37:05.613
I mean, maybe she was just hiding
from you or something.

01:37:05.697 --> 01:37:08.074
Why would she be hiding from me?

01:37:09.033 --> 01:37:11.869
I don't know. I mean, where is she then?

01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:16.874

that she was hiding from me?

Did she say anything to you about me?

01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:31.305
Yeah. She thinks you're a dork.

01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:33.474

how really, really sorry I am

about everything.

01:40:02.748 --> 01:40:05.585

I just quit my job this morning

01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:20.641
and then I had a fight with Becky 'cause
I told her I wasn't gonna move in with her,

01:40:20.725 --> 01:40:24.312
and she really just wants to kill me.

01:40:24.937 --> 01:40:29.108
And there is just no way
to explain how I feel.

01:40:29.192 --> 01:40:31.194
And I don't...

01:40:33.029 --> 01:40:35.448
I guess
I'll just have to figure myself out.

Enid, I'm not mad at you.

are really starting to look up for me

01:44:29.890 --> 01:44:31.851
since my life turned to shit.

01:44:32.476 --> 01:44:35.062
