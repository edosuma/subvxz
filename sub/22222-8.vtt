WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:04.790
( electricity crackling )

00:04.881 --> 00:08.419
Hey, fellas, knock it off.
I'm trying to work here.

00:09.093 --> 00:11.049
( crackling )

00:11.137 --> 00:12.752
Knock it off!

00:12.847 --> 00:14.428
That's enough.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.509
Crais! Where is it?

00:21.314 --> 00:22.975
Crais!

00:23.065 --> 00:24.316
Yo, Captain.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.435
( knocking )

00:25.526 --> 00:27.187
(whines)

00:27.278 --> 00:28.893
Where is it?

00:35.453 --> 00:37.739
What have you done?

00:37.830 --> 00:42.164
I've taken propulsion off-line
to optimize the energy
transfer rate.

00:42.251 --> 00:47.041
I'm hoping that it will
ease his pain and speed
the recovery process.

00:47.131 --> 00:48.962
Very elegant.

00:49.050 --> 00:52.133
You seem to have an intuitive
grasp of Talyn's subsystems.

00:52.220 --> 00:55.428
Well, it just felt right.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.470
It is more than right.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.935
I can sense his easing.

01:05.942 --> 01:10.276
Have you given any thought
to my previous proposal?

01:18.704 --> 01:20.240
(door control beeps)

01:22.500 --> 01:24.582
Talyn, open the door!

01:26.254 --> 01:27.744
( control beeps )

01:29.006 --> 01:30.792
Crais! I know you're in there!

01:30.883 --> 01:33.795
Playtime is over.
Open the damn door!

01:33.886 --> 01:35.422
(thump)

01:35.513 --> 01:38.550
Meet me later in my quarters.
There is much more for
us to discuss.

01:38.641 --> 01:40.927
Talyn, open the door.

01:41.018 --> 01:44.226
Hey, you wanna mess with me?

01:44.313 --> 01:45.553
What seems to be the problem?

01:45.648 --> 01:49.436
Keeping the DRDs over my head
working 24-7, so I can't sleep.

01:49.527 --> 01:50.607
Repairs to Talyn.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.151
All the doors, locked.

01:52.238 --> 01:54.650
The shower ice-cold, so I'm
freezing the boys off.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.150
John, what are you
talking about?

01:56.242 --> 01:59.780
It's not really a problem but
you do not mess with my stuff.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.371
Where's Wynonna?
-What?

02:01.455 --> 02:03.491
Wy... non... na.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.243
Aeryn:
His pulse pistol.
-My gun.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.949
Well, maybe Rygel came...

02:07.044 --> 02:09.251
Rygel and Stark have been on
recon for more than a day.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.202
John...

02:10.298 --> 02:12.209
Don't call me John!

02:12.300 --> 02:13.710
Crichton, then.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.541
Are you accusing me of theft?

02:15.636 --> 02:19.675
Talyn, you've seen them both
naked. Perhaps you can
tell us who's bigger.

02:22.852 --> 02:25.093
Talyn...
( clears throat)

02:25.187 --> 02:27.314
In addition to their
current duties,

02:27.398 --> 02:31.311
please have the DRDs keep an
eye out for Mr. Crichton's
pulse weapon.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.063
He seems to have mislaid it.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.269
Will there be anything else?

02:34.363 --> 02:37.196
Yeah. Hang a left before
we hit that moon.

02:37.283 --> 02:40.195
What moon?
-Sma|| one, dead ahead.

02:41.746 --> 02:45.079
Aeryn:
Our orbital plan is well clear
of this planet's moons.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.201
How could we miss it?

02:46.292 --> 02:47.532
Might have been below
the ring plane.

02:47.626 --> 02:50.538
Talyn, get a fix on
all orbital objects.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.371
lt's changing course and speed.
Accelerating.

02:53.466 --> 02:54.751
(Talyn beeps )

02:56.886 --> 02:58.296
Crais:
Talyn, remain calm.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.888
Main cannon is arming.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.587
Aeryn, bring propulsion
back on line.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.263
Working on it. 20 microts.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.512
Crais:
Talyn, focus on propulsion.

03:06.145 --> 03:07.180
That's no moon.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.138
Crais:
Talyn, focus on propulsion!

03:10.232 --> 03:11.768
That's a budong!

03:22.078 --> 03:24.444
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.247
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

03:28.334 --> 03:29.915
I'm trying to stay alive...

03:30.002 --> 03:31.913
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

03:32.004 --> 03:34.711
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

03:34.799 --> 03:36.255
If you can hear me...
Beware.

03:36.342 --> 03:38.333
If I make it back...
Will they follow?

03:38.427 --> 03:41.134
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

03:41.222 --> 03:45.716
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.142
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

03:48.229 --> 03:50.686
Not show them...
You exist...

03:50.773 --> 03:54.482
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.638
Crais:
Aeryn, propulsion!

04:26.725 --> 04:28.135
Should be on line!

04:28.227 --> 04:29.387
It's totally black out there.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.469
This big guppyjust
locked us in.

04:31.564 --> 04:33.395
Crais:
Talyn, cease fire!

04:33.482 --> 04:34.597
Officer Sun.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.774
Try and override the weapons.

04:37.445 --> 04:40.357
Talyn, you will desist.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.564
It's not working.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.738
(groaning)

04:43.826 --> 04:46.158
Obviously, we hit something.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.080
The main cannon is out.
It's damaged.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.907
And maneuvering jets
are firing.

04:53.002 --> 04:55.459
No, Talyn! No, do not panic!

04:55.546 --> 04:57.912
You're costing us vital time!

04:58.883 --> 05:00.498
Talyn, listen to me.

05:00.593 --> 05:03.300
Focus on a single point
with your senses.

05:03.387 --> 05:06.800
Align yourself with that point
and block out all other
distractions.

05:06.891 --> 05:08.631
(garbled grunting )

05:10.352 --> 05:11.558
Well done, Talyn.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.727
What do we know about budongs?
-Next to nothing.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.645
Live ones are exceedingly rare.

05:15.733 --> 05:18.019
We're still moving.
We're caught in some sort of

05:18.110 --> 05:19.975
electromagnetic current,
and we're moving...

05:20.070 --> 05:22.812
Down. We're going down.
We're being swallowed.
We're moving down.

05:22.907 --> 05:24.818
Talyn, set a course
against the current.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.274
Officer Sun, options?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.744
We are incapable of Starburst.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.159
Can we shoot our way out?

05:29.246 --> 05:32.113
No. The main cannon is dead.
We are flying in the dark,

05:32.208 --> 05:34.119
and we are still losing ground
to this current.

05:34.210 --> 05:36.326
Down. Do we wanna be going down?

05:36.420 --> 05:38.581
We have no notion of which way
is up or which way is down.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.754
Yo, Jonah, we have been
swallowed!

05:40.841 --> 05:44.049
That is down, and |, for one,
do not want to be budong chow.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.171
You will limit your remarks to
something useful or I will...

05:45.262 --> 05:46.513
Aeryn:
No, Crais!
-Or what?!

05:46.597 --> 05:48.883
He's right. John is right.

05:51.727 --> 05:52.762
Drop anchor.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.968
Anchor?
-Yes, anchor!

05:54.063 --> 05:56.224
(growling gurgle)
No, Talyn.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.226
But only slightly stupid.
It might buy us time.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.104
Officer Sun, take Crichton
get suited for space.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.311
In the armory you'll find
a case of Taks.
-Taks?

06:03.405 --> 06:04.861
Use the hamman side
Access Chamber.

06:04.949 --> 06:07.110
Mooring points are located
on the hull...
-Outside.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.533
Yes sir, I have it.
Dropping anchor.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.709
Aeryn:
Tak-five torpedoes. Handheld.

06:19.797 --> 06:23.915
Fusion-bonded rhenium claws.
Stick, never let go.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.715
Cables attach to the rear.

06:25.803 --> 06:28.715
So we're going to use this
high-grade hardware like a
mooring harpoon?

06:28.806 --> 06:30.137
Unless you have a better idea.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.260
It was my idea.
But will it work?

06:32.351 --> 06:34.342
Well, the cables are
iridium alloy.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.347
As long as we hit bone,
we should hold fast.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.474
Good. I must be smarter
than I look.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.181
That would be easy.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.187
All right.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.368
You know, I'd be happy
to swap jobs,

06:53.455 --> 06:55.787
come back in there and work
the mooring control panel.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.126
Forget about it, you can't even
operate door controls.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.667
There's a reason for that.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.039
Do it.

07:03.632 --> 07:04.792
Damn!

07:04.883 --> 07:07.044
Your twin got the brains?

07:07.136 --> 07:10.219
No, Crais.
He's trying to make a point.

07:10.306 --> 07:11.796
Crais:
If I may interrupt...

07:11.890 --> 07:13.346
Damn. Open channel.

07:13.434 --> 07:18.349
Officer Sun this current
is pulling us at
1.2 metras a microt.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.474
Aeryn:
Almost there.

07:19.565 --> 07:20.896
You ready?

07:20.983 --> 07:21.688
Do it.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.185
(metallic clang )

07:23.277 --> 07:27.236
(growling gurgle)
Do... not... argue.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.941
All right, we don't
have visual yet.

07:32.036 --> 07:33.901
Wall range is closing.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.237
Zero-point-five metras.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.577
I can't see anything yet.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.158
I need visual. I need to be
able to see the ribs.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.244
Point one...

07:43.339 --> 07:45.375
Still nothing. Pitch black.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.548
Coulda woulda shoulda
brought a flashlight.

07:48.052 --> 07:49.758
Whoa!

07:49.845 --> 07:53.713
Navigating against this
current is proving to be
somewhat difficult.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.726
Aeryn:
Don't know yet.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.480
Soft flesh! We missed the bone!

08:00.564 --> 08:02.646
Not gonna hold!

08:02.733 --> 08:04.724
Crais:
Talyn, reverse jets.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.319
Release the cable.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.235
Too late! Get down!

08:12.368 --> 08:13.278
Reload.

08:13.369 --> 08:14.233
Got it!

08:14.328 --> 08:17.115
Crais, I'm going to go
for a second shot.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.037
Talyn, back to the wall!

08:19.500 --> 08:20.831
(grunts)

08:20.918 --> 08:23.204
Set!
-Still no visual.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.911
Talyn, slower.

08:28.092 --> 08:29.252
There it is.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.218
Go, go, go.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.430
Come on!

08:40.938 --> 08:43.520
Crais, stabilize the
frelling ship!

08:43.607 --> 08:44.847
We're holding.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.728
Swinging towards the wall.

08:48.821 --> 08:51.312
What are you doing?
That one held.

08:51.407 --> 08:53.238
Making sure.

08:54.410 --> 08:55.365
Door!

08:56.370 --> 08:58.361
Crais, third Tak away!

08:59.665 --> 09:02.202
Whose stupid idea was
this, anyway?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.452
Yours.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.250
What do you mean,
they're not here?

09:09.341 --> 09:11.957
How can you frell up
a simple rendezvous?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.588
They're just not here.

09:13.679 --> 09:17.297
Not one of you deficients can
properly read a chart.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.803
Right. Let's call the frelniks.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.101
Remember Aeryn's mother?
Aeryn's mother,
Retrieval Squad?!

09:23.188 --> 09:26.430
Yes, well, she's out there,
and she's looking for us.

09:26.525 --> 09:30.313
Radio silence keeps us
hidden and alive.

09:30.404 --> 09:35.649
If those toeskas have left us,
after all I've done for them...

09:39.413 --> 09:41.153
It can't be.
-What?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.660
What the yotz are you
looking at?

09:43.751 --> 09:45.662
That lump?

09:45.753 --> 09:48.745
That lump is a budong!

09:48.839 --> 09:49.749
What are you doing?!

09:49.840 --> 09:51.705
Shutting everything down!

09:51.800 --> 09:53.256
Stop being a welnitz!

09:53.343 --> 09:55.254
We can just fly around it.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.176
Budongs are harmless,
aren't they?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.845
They're a frelling
shipping hazard!

09:58.932 --> 10:03.221
Our ship's energy fields make
us electromagnetic candy.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.098
I've never heard anyone
say that.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.725
That's because they're
all dead!

10:06.815 --> 10:08.806
Dead?! We're flying out
of here.

10:08.901 --> 10:12.564
No! No, the power stays off!
Off! Off! Off! Off! Off!

10:12.654 --> 10:15.145
Rygel:
I am the eater not the eatee!

10:20.370 --> 10:22.361
(gasping)

10:37.888 --> 10:39.753
(flatulence)

10:41.225 --> 10:44.888
( high-pitched voice ):
Can we please restart
the Pod now?

10:52.069 --> 10:53.104
Cables are holding.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.436
Yes. Good.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.691
It was well done.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.068
By everyone.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.195
It's warm in here.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.446
Aeryn, uh, there's something
we need to discuss.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.247
How to get out of this animal.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.040
Indeed.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.583
Crichton will be
up here shortly.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.959
What we have to discuss
does not concern him.

11:14.049 --> 11:17.587
I have engaged privacy mode and
I wish to speak solely
with you.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.301
(door control beeps)

11:21.640 --> 11:24.222
Crais (statically):
Crichton, meet... my quarters.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.016
Crais, your comms are
fritzing. Where?

11:27.104 --> 11:29.015
Meet me in my quarters.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.687
Quarters.

11:35.237 --> 11:40.903
Because of what has passed
between us, I wanted to wait...

11:40.993 --> 11:45.703
for you to make up your own
mind in your own time, but...

11:45.789 --> 11:48.371
events have led us to
a new situation.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.200
Crais!

11:51.295 --> 11:53.081
No, of course, not here.

11:53.171 --> 11:59.212
Tell me he's got some pumps in
the closet, or inflatable
Scorvian or Wynonna.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.885
(pulsating whine)

12:02.514 --> 12:04.550
PK vid chip.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.430
Home movies?

12:10.814 --> 12:13.305
Oh, I really shouldn't.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.146
Well, you can have anything
you want. Anything.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.152
Crais:
Aeryn Sun.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.484
Are you offering yourself?

12:27.497 --> 12:30.864
Take what you want, Crais,
and I won't stop you.

12:33.295 --> 12:36.162
Listen, Crais, I'm not prepared
to remain onboard Talyn...

12:36.256 --> 12:38.497
under these circum...
-Let me finish.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.211
Perhaps it would be
best for, uh...

12:47.100 --> 12:52.015
Perhaps it would be best for
you to see me as I am.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.527
Sorry I'm late.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.074
What did I miss?

13:48.161 --> 13:53.155
We were just discussing how best
to resolve our... predicament.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.244
Really?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.166
Aeryn: Mm-hmm.
Crais: Yes.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.872
Yes, Talyn has completed
his scan of the budong.

14:03.051 --> 14:07.010
Right. Have him whip up
a hologram.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.587
Not necessary.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.139
l have a direct link.

14:11.226 --> 14:14.059
We're moored in the passageway,
above the stomach.

14:14.146 --> 14:19.061
The budong has too much mass to
scan its length successfully.

14:19.151 --> 14:21.688
But I believe we can navigate
the digestive tract.

14:21.778 --> 14:26.863
And what about gizzards, stomach
acids, bowel obstructions?

14:26.950 --> 14:28.861
Budong's are very
large structures.

14:28.952 --> 14:33.241
And Talyn is designed
for intense combat.
We should pass through.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.947
You know what, I may have
swallowed a quarter
once or twice,

14:36.043 --> 14:38.455
but this seems to me to be
a little bit different.

14:38.545 --> 14:42.379
Can we not find an alternative,
use an alternative orifice?

14:42.466 --> 14:45.082
Blowhole or something?

14:45.177 --> 14:47.008
Not according to our scan.

14:47.095 --> 14:53.136
So, according to your scan,
assuming this budong is
not constipated,

14:53.226 --> 14:55.638
you... (laughs)

14:55.729 --> 14:57.936
you want to fly out the ass?

14:58.023 --> 14:59.854
And-and Talyn can do that?

14:59.941 --> 15:03.069
He's lik- he's like, he's not
gonna freak on that plan?

15:03.153 --> 15:04.393
Not with help.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.399
What help?

15:13.371 --> 15:17.159
l have decided to take the
neural interface with Talyn.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.122
The Hand of Friendship?

15:24.466 --> 15:26.172
I see.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.843
I thought Talyn was designed
for one captain only.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.843
We have devised a modified
transponder for insertion.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.225
Yes, I bet you have.

15:37.312 --> 15:41.225
So, you, uh two...

15:41.316 --> 15:44.683
three, you three are,
uh, gonna be one.

15:46.071 --> 15:49.734
And, uh, anything I can
do to help?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.653
At the moment, no, nothing.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.074
Exactly.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.871
It's a good plan.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.412
Where are you going?

16:01.503 --> 16:03.744
You heard the man.
Nothing for me to do.

16:03.839 --> 16:04.828
John, wait.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.288
Aeryn, you do not
want me there.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.964
l-l do want you there.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.666
Why? To throw rice?
Forget about it.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.138
I've seen my share of hardware
insertion. I'm not watching.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.257
It's been modified.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.463
Yeah, I heard that.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.344
Less invasive; it's-it's safer.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.141
Yes, it's new. It's improved.
It's the Finger of Friendship.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.390
$19.95. But wait, kids,
there's more!

16:21.481 --> 16:22.641
What's the matter with you?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.347
This is the right thing to do.
-For who?

16:24.442 --> 16:28.276
For all of us. He needs my help
to control Talyn to get us out.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.611
Aeryn...

16:30.699 --> 16:32.860
do what you have to do.
-I will.

16:32.951 --> 16:36.068
Fine, but do not sugarcoat
it for me.
"Right thing to do," my ass.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.323
And what's that supposed
to mean?

16:37.414 --> 16:40.872
It means that you do things
the way you want to,

16:40.959 --> 16:43.996
when you want to, with who
you want to do them.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.588
It's got nothing to do
with what I want.

16:45.672 --> 16:49.005
It's always about what
you want!

16:49.092 --> 16:53.176
So yes, walk back in there and
let Crais stick a spike in the
back of your neck.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.299
Listen to me!
-It'll be a brave new
universe, Aeryn.

16:55.390 --> 16:59.759
You and Crais. You can finally
rejoin that Peacekeeper family
you've been pining for

16:59.853 --> 17:01.263
from the moment we met!

17:01.354 --> 17:02.605
You have got this so...

17:02.689 --> 17:06.557
Just don't pretend to me that it
wasn't what you always wanted!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.193
You finished?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.823
You're right.

17:15.911 --> 17:17.947
I don't want you there.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.998
I know you think I'm
overreacting, but I'm not.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.296
I'm keeping us alive.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.796
A budong is a killing machine,
death incarnate.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.629
Five cycles I spent on a
budong mining operation.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.465
Thousands went in;
none came out.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.926
And those budongs were dead.
This one's very much alive.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.353
(mumbling)

17:45.440 --> 17:46.270
What's that?

17:46.358 --> 17:48.394
(muttering gibberish )

17:48.485 --> 17:50.976
My mother sucks what?!

17:52.530 --> 17:53.736
You heard me.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.109
What have you eaten?!
Oh-oh-uh-oh...

17:56.201 --> 17:58.112
Oh-oh, I think I'm going to...

17:58.203 --> 17:59.659
Waste funnel's in the back.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.407
(whimpering)

18:02.290 --> 18:04.201
I love that trick.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.203
(vomiting )

18:18.890 --> 18:21.381
(door swooshes open )

18:24.104 --> 18:26.390
(door shutting)

18:28.233 --> 18:30.770
( control beeps )
Talyn, open the door.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.191
Please.

18:33.863 --> 18:38.357
Talyn, open the door. Please.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.666
Damn... idiot.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.842
Crais:
There will be pain.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.386
It will pass.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.343
Try not to control Talyn's
systems too quickly.

19:08.606 --> 19:11.598
His will and his ways are
much stronger now.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.607
Accept him for what he is,
and he will welcome you.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.940
This is a moment we have
long waited for, Aeryn.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.532
(hissing)

19:28.501 --> 19:30.332
Are you certain?

19:36.426 --> 19:38.337
( screams )

19:38.428 --> 19:41.261
( groans )

19:59.324 --> 20:02.908
He is beyond beautiful.

20:05.372 --> 20:10.662
Welcome to our world,
Officer Sun.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.165
(whirring )

20:30.480 --> 20:32.345
Reach out with his senses.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.810
What do you see?

20:35.985 --> 20:38.067
Passageways.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.939
Now, focus on a specific object.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.075
A door.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.374
Good.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.331
Now open it.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.167
(chuckling)

21:03.263 --> 21:04.423
Very good.
-Oh...

21:04.514 --> 21:05.799
You learn fast.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.551
I'm tempted to say you've had
enough for one day,

21:07.642 --> 21:10.179
but circumstances being
what they are...

21:11.896 --> 21:16.060
Imagine you wish to speak with
someone. Someone far away.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.687
( beeping, static)

21:18.778 --> 21:21.736
Rygel (statically):
For yotz sake, answer if
you can hear, fekkiks!

21:21.823 --> 21:23.029
I did that?

21:23.116 --> 21:24.947
You aligned your comms
with long-range scan.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.161
As I said, you learn very fast.

21:27.245 --> 21:29.076
Rygel:
Hello, out there, anyone!

21:29.164 --> 21:30.745
Come and get me off this
stinking Pod!

21:30.832 --> 21:32.117
Dominar, you're back
from recon.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.621
Well, of course I'm back.
Where the yotz are you?

21:35.712 --> 21:40.046
We're somewhat inconveniently
tethered inside a budong.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.168
Inconvenient?!

21:41.259 --> 21:42.999
Kiss my mivonks!

21:43.094 --> 21:44.675
Stark, get out here.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.754
Stark thinks he's some kind
of budong expert.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.464
What? Oh, you're loose!

21:49.559 --> 21:52.141
Not half as loose as Chiana.
Now, listen.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.843
I've got Talyn on the comms.

21:53.938 --> 21:56.099
They're stuck inside
the budong.

21:56.191 --> 21:58.182
Inside?! No.

21:58.276 --> 22:01.268
Not for long. We hope
to pass through the
digestive track shortly.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.023
No! No, no, no, no, no!

22:03.114 --> 22:04.729
You-you can't!

22:04.824 --> 22:08.112
Its stomach is an inferno!
Nothing ever comes out
of a budong alive!

22:08.203 --> 22:09.363
Talyn...

22:09.454 --> 22:11.911
Its stomach burns at
5,000 klances.

22:11.998 --> 22:15.661
Anything that goes in,
comes out liquid ore!
-Shut up! Shut up!

22:15.752 --> 22:16.912
Talyn!
-Calm yourself.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.210
No, Talyn...
-Talyn, do not panic!

22:19.297 --> 22:20.628
You're dead!

22:20.715 --> 22:22.296
You're dead already!

22:22.383 --> 22:24.339
Crais:
Stark, do not panic!

22:25.637 --> 22:27.252
We've lost the Pod signal.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.838
Talyn, calm down now!

22:29.933 --> 22:31.298
Aeryn...
-Yes.

22:31.392 --> 22:33.883
ls manual override in place
for the moorings?

22:33.978 --> 22:35.229
Yes.
-Stay at that control.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.269
Do not let Talyn release...

22:37.357 --> 22:39.564
( high-pitched whine)
( screaming )

22:39.651 --> 22:41.642
Crais? Talyn, what are you...

22:41.736 --> 22:43.101
What have you done to him?

22:43.196 --> 22:45.278
John, get up here now!

22:45.990 --> 22:47.321
(groaning)

22:51.246 --> 22:53.032
What went wrong?
What happened?

22:53.122 --> 22:55.579
Aeryn:
I'm not sure. Talyn was
screaming to be released,

22:55.667 --> 22:58.500
and then Crais was trying to
reason with him, and he...

23:00.838 --> 23:02.123
Where's Crais?

23:02.215 --> 23:03.295
I thought he was with you.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.840
Talyn, where's Captain Crais?
He was.

23:05.927 --> 23:07.758
Talyn, listen to me.
-You didn't see him leave?

23:07.845 --> 23:11.804
Oh, I was busy. Talyn?
He's not responding.

23:11.891 --> 23:15.258
Houston, we have a problem.
Didn't you take the transponder?

23:15.812 --> 23:17.268
Then use it!

23:31.869 --> 23:34.246
Aeryn:
I see him. Access Chamber.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.831
He's trying to release
the cables.

23:35.915 --> 23:36.995
What? Why?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.414
I don't know.

23:38.501 --> 23:39.786
Well, can you stop him?

23:39.877 --> 23:43.290
Wait, I... Yes, I can keep the
cables secure, but I...

23:43.381 --> 23:45.292
I can't leave this
override panel.

23:45.383 --> 23:46.964
It's the only advantage
I've got.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.302
Fine. I'll go, you give
me your gun.

23:48.386 --> 23:50.251
You hold him off.
-Listen...

23:50.346 --> 23:51.847
Aeryn, your gun!

23:54.434 --> 23:55.469
Listen, he's...

24:00.815 --> 24:03.306
Aeryn, get ready to open the
Access Chamber door.

24:03.401 --> 24:04.937
I'll try.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.236
Aeryn (over comms ):
Crais has released a cable.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.315
One more, and we're
budong manure.

24:11.409 --> 24:14.242
I can't stop him, and Talyn
is resisting.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.160
Aeryn, the door!

24:16.247 --> 24:17.657
I'll try.

24:28.426 --> 24:30.166
Crais!

24:30.261 --> 24:34.254
Get your fat, hairy ass away
from the mooring controls.

24:34.349 --> 24:36.681
I see you found a weapon.

24:37.769 --> 24:40.010
What do you intend
to do with it?

24:40.104 --> 24:41.139
Shoot me?

24:41.230 --> 24:42.356
That's one option.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.600
Of course, it is.

24:43.691 --> 24:47.104
We've come full circle,
John Crichton.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.731
Now you want to kill me.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.357
And then don't make my day.

24:50.448 --> 24:53.155
Crichton:
Step away from the panel.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.402
I can't.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.576
Talyn won't let me.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.494
He doesn't believe the Banik.

24:58.581 --> 25:00.617
He wants to fly free.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.448
You'll have to shoot me.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.622
( screams )

25:09.676 --> 25:11.917
You see, Crais?

25:12.011 --> 25:13.626
I don't have to kill you.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.632
I wish you had!

25:15.723 --> 25:16.428
Talyn!

25:16.516 --> 25:19.178
(sustained screaming )

25:20.645 --> 25:21.680
( screaming )

25:21.771 --> 25:23.011
( groans )

25:23.106 --> 25:25.267
Talyn, stop it now!

25:25.358 --> 25:27.314
Kill me!

25:27.402 --> 25:28.892
(screams continue)

25:30.655 --> 25:32.566
Aeryn, what the hell
is going on?

25:32.657 --> 25:34.397
( screaming )

25:37.537 --> 25:38.902
(grunting)

25:40.081 --> 25:42.242
Talyn, please.

25:42.333 --> 25:43.709
( clicks )

25:55.221 --> 25:57.257
Crichton:
Wake up, Bialar.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.759
Talyn?

26:04.147 --> 26:06.012
Aeryn knocked him cold.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.939
Where is she?

26:09.026 --> 26:11.984
She's on the bridge, patching
up systems. She'll be here
in a little bit.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.279
But before she gets here,
or Talyn wakes up,

26:15.366 --> 26:17.106
you and l are going to have
a little Q and A.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.611
Put that weapon away.

26:18.703 --> 26:20.409
Now, you may be right.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.612
I might want to kill you.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.168
Ask your questions.

26:26.252 --> 26:30.291
You and Talyn. What the
hell is going on?

26:30.381 --> 26:32.793
Cybernetic bleed-back.

26:32.884 --> 26:36.752
My sores and lesions are
physical symptoms.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.586
You want to expand on that?

26:38.681 --> 26:41.263
Talyn did that?

26:41.350 --> 26:48.142
In times of stress, our
emotions, our desires,
can merge.

26:48.232 --> 26:52.601
And Talyn can gain a degree
of control over me.

26:52.695 --> 26:56.062
Resistance causes pain.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.240
Clarification?

27:00.453 --> 27:02.694
Talyn controls you?

27:04.040 --> 27:05.905
(sighs)

27:06.000 --> 27:07.991
Crais...

27:08.085 --> 27:11.293
you just set up Aeryn for the
same problems you're having.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.587
No. Her transponder is limited.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.926
She will not be harmed
by Talyn.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.921
You cockroach!

27:18.012 --> 27:21.596
The choice was Aeryn's.
Are we finished?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.347
No.

27:24.977 --> 27:29.095
I keep hearing that
you've changed.

27:30.399 --> 27:35.519
I think, weather changes.

27:36.823 --> 27:40.532
And we just keep making
the same mistake.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.371
Remember why you're alive.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.248
Aeryn:
Crais.

27:54.674 --> 27:55.914
You all right?

27:56.008 --> 27:57.293
I'm alive.

27:57.385 --> 27:58.670
How's Talyn?

27:58.761 --> 28:00.467
I, uh, overloaded his
beta channel.

28:00.555 --> 28:02.170
Knocked him into sleep mode.

28:02.265 --> 28:05.723
He may have a mild headache when
he comes around in a few arns.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.641
You surpass yourself,
Officer Sun.

28:07.728 --> 28:11.061
I wouldn't try it again.
I don't think he knew what
I was doing this time.

28:11.148 --> 28:14.185
Well, we must wake him.
The sooner we...

28:14.277 --> 28:17.440
Whoa, whoa, hang on. Don't we
want to figure out what we're
going to do first?

28:17.530 --> 28:19.566
You're no use to us dead.
You rest.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.443
I think...
-No, rest!

28:21.534 --> 28:24.116
You're not going to make it
out the door in your
current condition.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.409
I must get to... bridge!

28:25.496 --> 28:27.953
( groans )

28:28.040 --> 28:29.871
Why doesn't anyone ever
listen to me?

28:31.294 --> 28:33.660
I'm gonna check the cables.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.370
Don't shoot him unless
you have to.

28:39.927 --> 28:42.634
Rygel:
Is the budong far enough away?

28:42.722 --> 28:43.757
Yes.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.338
Is it watching us?

28:45.433 --> 28:47.344
Mm-mm-mm... no.

28:47.435 --> 28:50.927
Then let's power up and
escape while we can.

28:51.022 --> 28:52.102
( snickers )

28:52.189 --> 28:54.054
That's it!

28:54.150 --> 28:55.811
That's vomit.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.314
No, that's it.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.111
Aeryn! Crichton! Crais!

29:01.198 --> 29:03.063
I see it. A plan.

29:03.159 --> 29:04.899
Aeryn! Crichton! Crais!

29:04.994 --> 29:06.279
Why don't they answer?

29:06.370 --> 29:07.826
'Cause they're dead.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.495
Give it to me.
-What?

29:09.582 --> 29:11.197
You pulled the comms relay
circuit.

29:11.292 --> 29:12.623
Give it to me.
-Get back.

29:12.710 --> 29:15.372
They are dead, and we are
leaving.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.332
Ah...

29:17.423 --> 29:19.880
(QUIPS)
(gasps )

29:19.967 --> 29:25.007
-Now be a good little Banik and
help me power up this Pod.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.507
Hmm?

29:26.599 --> 29:28.681
(yelling)

29:28.768 --> 29:30.304
(groaning)

29:44.075 --> 29:46.987
Cable's fine. Mooring control
is totally buggered

29:47.078 --> 29:49.319
but we should be able to
cut loose if we have to.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.949
What's your problem?

29:52.041 --> 29:53.076
Shouldn't you be with Crais?

29:53.167 --> 29:55.453
He's sleeping.
Answer the question.

29:55.544 --> 30:00.880
Aeryn, I am doing everything I
can to get us out of this
absurdly large space monster.

30:00.967 --> 30:04.334
I'm doing the good little
soldier bit. What else do
you want from me?

30:04.428 --> 30:06.259
I want you to stop acting
like a drannit.

30:06.347 --> 30:08.212
You know what?
I have no idea what a
drannit is.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.140
No, don't play dumb with me.
That hasn't worked for over two
cycles, John.

30:11.227 --> 30:13.218
Aeryn, I am dumb.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.600
I don't understand you half the
time and I have no idea what
a drannit is!

30:16.691 --> 30:18.227
Fine, forget the drannit.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.228
Fine, screw the drannit!

30:22.780 --> 30:25.362
What?

30:25.449 --> 30:29.362
You really have no idea what
a drannit is, do you?

30:31.288 --> 30:32.744
What's a drannit?

30:32.832 --> 30:34.288
( beeping )

30:34.375 --> 30:37.208
Stark ( over comms ):
Vomit. Come in, please. Vomit!

30:37.294 --> 30:39.080
Stark, you're still here.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.662
Oh, wonderful. They're alive.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.749
Now you can torture them with
your inane dribblings.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.551
I know how we're gonna
get you out of there.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.511
Vomit.

30:51.225 --> 30:52.260
Vomit?
-Vomit?

30:52.351 --> 30:54.433
Rygel and I are going to
feed the budong.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.636
Overfeed the budong. Ice.

30:56.731 --> 30:59.313
From the planet's rings.
-lce? That's beautiful, Stark.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.265
They can now die laughing.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.566
Wait, wait, wait. There's more.

31:02.653 --> 31:05.395
You're gonna have to dump
some of your cesium fuel.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.070
Our fuel?

31:07.158 --> 31:08.398
Yes.

31:08.492 --> 31:12.986
Dude, cesium and water, and ice
is water make exploding water?

31:13.080 --> 31:16.368
Yes, the explosion should
make the budong vomit.

31:16.459 --> 31:19.792
And you can ride out on
the wave of the vomit.
In front of the vomit.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.961
Stark, give us a moment.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.585
They're going to say yes.

31:24.675 --> 31:27.337
Rygel:
No, Sebaceans are ugly,
not stupid.

31:27.428 --> 31:32.388
They know that cesium fuel and
water do not react without an
ignition source.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.217
They'll say no.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.348
( comms static crackles )
Here it comes.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.521
Aeryn:
Stark, we're going to
have to say no.

31:40.608 --> 31:44.100
See?
-You can light the cesium
with-with Talyn's cannon.

31:44.195 --> 31:46.151
Talyn's cannon is
out of commission.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.605
But w-w-we have to ha-have
a really big explosion.

31:49.700 --> 31:53.067
You must have some kind o-o-of
something that explodes
or something?

31:53.162 --> 31:56.450
No. The main cannon is out,
and I've launched all that...

31:57.374 --> 31:59.035
Oh.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.118
Oh...

32:02.213 --> 32:04.044
They had warheads?

32:04.131 --> 32:06.122
Oh, I disarmed them.

32:06.217 --> 32:07.878
You really should tell me
these things.

32:07.968 --> 32:10.254
How big?
-Big enough.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.633
Stark?

32:16.268 --> 32:18.759
We have an ignition source.

32:29.198 --> 32:30.608
Crais!

32:31.200 --> 32:32.906
Crais, wake up!

32:33.744 --> 32:34.984
The budong eats.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.410
You guys dump the cesium.

32:36.497 --> 32:40.115
I set the bomb and free the
cable. We all fly out.

32:40.209 --> 32:43.326
I'll talk you through the
procedure to arm the warhead
and release the cables.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.546
Crichton:
Then we're on the clock?

32:44.630 --> 32:47.747
Yes. You can delay the
detonation by 500 microts

32:47.842 --> 32:49.958
but if you are outside the ship
when it goes off...

32:50.052 --> 32:51.462
I'm toast.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.465
Aeryn:
Stark, we're waiting on you.

32:53.556 --> 32:54.841
Yes!

32:54.932 --> 32:56.172
Aah!

32:58.394 --> 33:01.431
Electromagnetic candy!

33:12.199 --> 33:13.655
You flew across its eye?

33:13.742 --> 33:15.278
I had to be sure it
would follow.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.109
Well, it is, and it's gaining!

33:17.204 --> 33:19.160
This Pod could never
outrun a budong.

33:19.248 --> 33:22.081
We just want it to eat
'cause we're candy!

33:22.168 --> 33:24.625
Candy? You'll kill us all,
you trankass!

33:24.712 --> 33:28.045
Mother always said I'd die
from incompetence.

33:28.132 --> 33:29.668
I finally know what she meant.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.716
That's why we keep people like
you chained in the first place.

33:32.803 --> 33:34.339
Your entire race...

33:34.889 --> 33:36.345
Shut up!

33:36.432 --> 33:38.263
We're candy!

33:39.393 --> 33:41.884
Okay, I'm there.

33:41.979 --> 33:45.517
Man, you guys should see
this ugly, sticky flesh.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.815
Kind of like my Aunt Ruth's
special Jell-O.

33:47.902 --> 33:49.438
Aeryn:
Can you access the panel?

33:49.528 --> 33:52.361
Ah, yeah. Give me a second.

33:53.407 --> 33:54.567
Yeah, got it.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.273
Right. Don't press the
green button yet.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.483
That arms the warhead.

33:57.578 --> 33:59.569
The blue key is the
cable release.

33:59.663 --> 34:03.247
Crichton, you ready for the
sequence? Don't frell this up.

34:03.334 --> 34:05.040
Areyn, give me some slack.

34:05.127 --> 34:08.039
I'm on maneuvering jets.
Crais, can you start
waking Talyn up?

34:11.175 --> 34:12.665
Talyn is already awake.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.216
What? John?

34:14.303 --> 34:18.546
Hey, Stark, you're ready yet?
I'm stuck out here
in spam land.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.802
Yes. Oh, no!

34:20.893 --> 34:22.224
Yes. Sort of...

34:22.311 --> 34:24.176
Oh, no, no...

34:24.271 --> 34:25.135
Come on.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.220
No, no, wait!

34:26.315 --> 34:28.101
Areyn:
Why isn't he communicating?

34:28.192 --> 34:30.103
John, I need you to put a
hold what you're doing.

34:30.194 --> 34:31.775
I need you to wait.

34:31.862 --> 34:33.693
His comm's on.

34:33.781 --> 34:36.773
(Stark whimpering )
-Ah, give me a break.

34:36.867 --> 34:40.325
Oh, yes, now. Do it now!
Do it now!

34:40.412 --> 34:43.620
Man, gotta love that
boy's confidence.

34:43.707 --> 34:46.824
Warhead armed.
500 microts and counting.

34:46.919 --> 34:48.500
(loud rumble)

34:48.587 --> 34:50.248
We're moving.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.125
Talyn?
-John, answer me.

34:52.216 --> 34:55.049
Releasing cable... now.

34:55.886 --> 34:57.262
( cries out )

34:58.389 --> 35:01.881
The cable, Areyn!

35:04.270 --> 35:05.601
Stark:
Aeryn...

35:05.688 --> 35:08.270
Areyn, we can't outrun the
budong much longer.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.222
You should have dumped
enough fuel.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.477
Not now, Stark!

35:11.568 --> 35:14.025
Talyn, Crichton is
outside the ship.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.274
He already knows.
He's been awake for some time.

35:16.365 --> 35:18.651
And moving into position
for the fuel dump.

35:18.742 --> 35:19.606
He's doing what?

35:19.702 --> 35:20.737
He's leaving Crichton behind.

35:20.828 --> 35:22.318
He... he can't!

35:22.413 --> 35:25.155
He correctly fears being
too close to the point
of detonation.

35:34.550 --> 35:37.007
Talyn just spaced John!

35:37.803 --> 35:39.384
(gasps )

35:39.471 --> 35:42.133
( panting )
Aeryn, can you read me?

35:42.224 --> 35:44.055
Can you read me?

35:44.143 --> 35:47.101
Okay. I'm at the hatch.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.222
Coming in.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.100
(door swooshing )

35:50.190 --> 35:54.308
( screaming )

35:54.403 --> 35:56.519
Open the door!

35:57.239 --> 35:59.855
I never thought...

35:59.950 --> 36:01.611
I tried to warn...

36:02.911 --> 36:05.323
Talyn never trusted Crichton.

36:05.414 --> 36:06.779
What are you talking about?

36:06.874 --> 36:08.410
Crichton is not a Peacekeeper.
He's not a Sebacean.

36:08.500 --> 36:12.163
So?
-So he finds him offensive.
Perceives him as a threat.

36:12.254 --> 36:13.243
To whom?!

36:13.339 --> 36:15.955
You. He wants to protect you.

36:17.259 --> 36:19.716
John is only dangerous
to himself.

36:19.803 --> 36:22.761
I tried to persuade Talyn that
he was wrong about Crichton.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.430
Well then persuade him now
to go back and get him.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.678
He cannot be coerced.
He will do as he wants.

36:27.770 --> 36:29.135
I can do nothing.

36:29.229 --> 36:30.969
Don't you lie to me, Crais.

36:31.065 --> 36:32.726
This is not about
what Talyn wants.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.932
You have taught him
everything he knows.

36:35.027 --> 36:37.268
This is about you, me and John.

36:37.363 --> 36:42.073
Hey, Talyn, I've been
reviewing this situation.

36:42.159 --> 36:45.196
Aeryn's pretty pissed at me,
but she kinda likes me.

36:45.287 --> 36:47.869
Talyn, prepare to dump
70% of our cesium.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.662
No, Talyn...
-Aeryn.

36:49.750 --> 36:53.083
Crais, well he hates me,
but he's not stupid.

36:53.170 --> 36:55.081
He knows if he kills me,
that Aeryn would do the math

36:55.172 --> 36:58.130
and his shot at domestic bliss
would be cutoff, along
with his balls.

36:58.217 --> 37:01.300
I regret losing
Commander Crichton.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.002
He was an honorable man.

37:03.097 --> 37:04.553
But we need you here, now.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.222
That leaves one suspect.

37:07.309 --> 37:11.769
Open the door, you soulless,
tin-headed, adolescent pig!

37:11.855 --> 37:14.847
Crichton is gone.
You've seen it.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.243
Aeryn:
Talyn, show me.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.911
The truth.

37:34.253 --> 37:36.585
( screaming )

37:40.092 --> 37:42.674
Peacekeeper lies.

37:42.761 --> 37:43.716
I'm...

37:43.804 --> 37:45.920
So you should be.
-Aeryn!

37:46.890 --> 37:48.346
Stark:
Aeryn!

37:48.434 --> 37:50.174
You have to do it now!

37:50.269 --> 37:52.180
You have to dump the fuel now!

37:52.271 --> 37:54.978
Yes, Stark. 200 microts
are left, I concur.

37:55.065 --> 37:58.228
Crais:
Talyn, initiate the
fuel dump now.

38:03.407 --> 38:06.570
( pounding )
Aeryn:
Open the frelling door!

38:07.536 --> 38:08.901
( beeps )

38:12.541 --> 38:14.532
(swooshing)

38:16.086 --> 38:19.453
Talyn, I recommend you do
as Officer Sun requests.

38:19.548 --> 38:22.130
(swooshing)

38:35.397 --> 38:37.934
Talyn...

38:38.025 --> 38:40.562
I want you to share
something with me.

38:41.445 --> 38:44.653
Before he dies.

38:44.740 --> 38:48.153
You can taste something that is
denied to Peacekeepers.

38:48.243 --> 38:51.201
Something that you
will never know.

38:59.046 --> 39:00.911
Areyn...

39:04.510 --> 39:07.001
Can you feel that?

39:08.388 --> 39:10.049
Good.

39:11.141 --> 39:13.598
Talyn...

39:13.685 --> 39:18.179
that is what it is
to need someone.

39:19.191 --> 39:21.432
You don't need me.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.522
You never will.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.478
Aeryn? No!

39:28.242 --> 39:29.778
(loud rumbling)

39:30.410 --> 39:32.321
(groaning)

39:33.288 --> 39:35.370
Ten microts.

39:43.799 --> 39:46.165
( low-pitched whine )

39:46.260 --> 39:48.091
Crais:
Five, four...

39:48.178 --> 39:50.169
three, two...

39:50.264 --> 39:51.629
one!

39:51.723 --> 39:53.554
Detonation!

40:05.195 --> 40:06.401
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

40:06.488 --> 40:07.989
(kissing sounds)

40:08.073 --> 40:10.985
Yes.
-I knew it would work.

40:13.287 --> 40:17.280
Talyn? Docking Web. On the Pod.

40:19.710 --> 40:23.544
Crais:
And set a course
away from here.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.127
Crais:
I wish you would reconsider.

40:32.222 --> 40:36.261
Aeryn:
My life has been filled
with doing what others think is right.

40:36.351 --> 40:39.764
For me. For now.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.639
This is right.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.022
Before you go,

40:48.113 --> 40:50.946
This contains various
surveillance logs.

40:51.033 --> 40:54.525
I believe Talyn showed
them to Crichton.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.281
Have you seen them?

40:56.371 --> 40:58.282
No.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.159
Perhaps you should.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.788
Some of the entries are
very... creative.

41:14.598 --> 41:16.338
I see you found Wynonna.

41:17.267 --> 41:18.928
DRD had it.

41:23.315 --> 41:25.601
Have you seen...

41:25.692 --> 41:27.023
this?

41:29.863 --> 41:31.603
Yeah.

41:31.698 --> 41:33.108
When did you see it?

41:33.200 --> 41:35.065
Aeryn, I'm not your boyfriend.
I'm not your husband.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.025
I'm not your anything.
You can do what you want.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.496
(clinks)

41:38.580 --> 41:40.195
(sighs)

41:42.292 --> 41:43.577
It's not real.

41:43.669 --> 41:46.160
You know that, don't you?

41:46.254 --> 41:51.544
The, uh... the last part.
Talyn altered the image.

41:51.635 --> 41:56.049
I never... recreated with
Crais.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.267
Not that it should matter.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.470
It does.

42:07.401 --> 42:09.266
It never did before.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.101
You see,

42:13.115 --> 42:15.106
I had this life.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.317
I liked it. It had rules.

42:18.412 --> 42:23.031
I followed the rules.
And that made everything right.

42:24.876 --> 42:28.289
And then you come along and
you frell everything up.

42:28.380 --> 42:31.338
S-strange human with...

42:31.425 --> 42:32.289
(sighs)

42:32.384 --> 42:34.625
arrogance, stubbornness...

42:34.720 --> 42:37.211
Dumb.
-Let me finish.

42:37.305 --> 42:42.220
You saw the recording and
you didn't say a word.

42:42.310 --> 42:46.929
You are like a plague,
John Crichton, and you
have ruined my life.

42:48.567 --> 42:51.024
And yet I just...

42:51.111 --> 42:52.942
keep coming back.

42:53.029 --> 42:54.769
(sighs)

42:58.243 --> 43:00.199
You could talk now.

43:00.287 --> 43:02.323
(sighs)

43:05.208 --> 43:07.665
Lemme show you something.

43:07.753 --> 43:09.618
(sighs)

43:09.713 --> 43:12.955
Come here. I'm not gonna bite.

43:25.896 --> 43:27.352
This is a star chart.

43:27.439 --> 43:30.522
These are the names
I gave the stars.

43:30.609 --> 43:32.224
They've already got names.

43:32.319 --> 43:36.562
Yeah, I know but Mintaka Three
sounds boring to me, anyway.

43:36.656 --> 43:40.490
That's Huey, Louie, Dewey.

43:41.536 --> 43:43.242
You see that one?

43:43.330 --> 43:45.321
There's that star right there.

43:45.415 --> 43:47.406
The bright one.

43:47.501 --> 43:50.117
That's my point of reference.

43:51.254 --> 43:53.290
My guide.

43:53.381 --> 43:57.215
And it always becomes the
center of my chart.

43:58.512 --> 44:01.345
I always name it Aeryn.

44:05.310 --> 44:07.892
You say it's your guide?

44:09.773 --> 44:12.765
It's my one constant.

44:21.284 --> 44:24.526
Would you like to
name some stars?

44:25.831 --> 44:28.038
There's a lot of them.

44:30.168 --> 44:32.545
Then we could take our time.
