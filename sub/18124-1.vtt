High school.
(SCOFFS)

01:04.257 --> 01:05.300
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

01:05.333 --> 01:07.411
Look familiar? Yeah.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.551
Being a teenager,
it can be rough,

01:11.618 --> 01:13.320
I'm not gonna
lie to you.

01:13.388 --> 01:16.973
But if you're a teenager,
and the world doesn't fit you,

01:17.041 --> 01:18.175
you're totally hosed!

01:18.242 --> 01:19.342
(MR. PITIFUL PLAYING)

01:19.410 --> 01:21.111
# Oh, Mr. Pit...
Oh, Mr. Pit...

01:21.179 --> 01:22.562
# Mr. Pitiful

01:22.864 --> 01:24.748
# Who let you down?

01:25.650 --> 01:27.283
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

01:27.351 --> 01:29.203
# Who let you down?
Who let you down?

01:29.270 --> 01:31.188
And the harder
you try to fit in,

01:31.255 --> 01:32.990
the more awkward it gets.

01:33.057 --> 01:34.974
# Oh, Mr. Pit...
Oh, Mr. Pit...

01:35.043 --> 01:36.760
# Mr. Pitiful

01:36.828 --> 01:38.094
# Who let you down?

01:38.162 --> 01:39.696
Look at this poor guy.

01:39.764 --> 01:41.297
Brutal!

01:41.365 --> 01:44.167
# Who let you down?
Who let you down? #

01:44.235 --> 01:46.369
But if you think
being a big, awkward teenager

01:46.437 --> 01:48.838
is about the worst thing
that can happen to you,

01:48.906 --> 01:51.741
try being
a 200-pound teenage dog

01:51.809 --> 01:54.160
with a radar dish
wrapped around your neck!

01:54.228 --> 01:56.814
Oh, yeah, that'll make me
real popular.

01:56.881 --> 02:00.316
Luckily, they're easy
to take off. Watch this.

02:00.384 --> 02:02.202
Marmaduke!
(GRUNTS) Told you!

02:02.269 --> 02:03.303
Where are you?

02:03.371 --> 02:05.072
Hold your horses.

02:05.139 --> 02:08.007
I'm Marmaduke, by the way.
I get yelled at a lot.

02:08.076 --> 02:10.210
Come on, let's meet the fam.
The two-leggers.

02:10.277 --> 02:11.545
You're gonna love them.

02:11.612 --> 02:13.280
Here I come!

02:15.282 --> 02:18.384
This little Padawan here
is Brian.

02:18.452 --> 02:21.438
Like most kids his age,
he loves to hang out with me.

02:21.506 --> 02:24.374
Come on, buddy.
I can't see!

02:24.442 --> 02:27.711
Yeah, I'm pretty busy myself.
I'll catch you later.

02:27.778 --> 02:30.214
And this social
butterfly here is Barbara.

02:30.281 --> 02:31.949
She loves to
play ball with me.

02:32.016 --> 02:34.334
Okay, Barb,
you throw and I catch.

02:34.402 --> 02:35.885
(CHUCKLES)
He can be like that.

02:35.953 --> 02:36.887
Not like that.

02:36.954 --> 02:38.121
Is somebody cooking?

02:38.622 --> 02:40.139
Food!

02:40.207 --> 02:42.876
Debbie's pretty cool,
and my main food hook-up.

02:42.944 --> 02:46.263
She slips me a steak here,
some turkey there.

02:46.330 --> 02:50.166
Which is why I think she doesn't
even care when I help myself.

02:50.434 --> 02:52.469
Come to daddy.

02:52.537 --> 02:54.988
Ahhh! Hot cheese!
Oh, hot cheese!

02:56.524 --> 02:57.890
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

02:57.958 --> 02:59.259
Marmaduke!

02:59.326 --> 03:01.461
(LAUGHING)

03:01.529 --> 03:02.979
The little one's Sarah.

03:03.047 --> 03:06.182
How cute is she?
And she's my biggest fan.

03:06.251 --> 03:08.618
You know, it's important for
them to get exercise at this age,

03:08.686 --> 03:10.753
so I try to take her
for a walk every day.

03:10.821 --> 03:11.654
(LAUGHING)

03:11.723 --> 03:14.341
She's got a great laugh,
doesn't she?

03:14.408 --> 03:15.859
Then there's
my owner, Phil.

03:15.894 --> 03:18.462
He's a marketing guy for
a local pet food company.

03:18.529 --> 03:20.096
I call him
Doctor No sometimes,

03:20.164 --> 03:22.132
'cause it's nothing
but rules with him.

03:22.199 --> 03:23.500
No slobbering.

03:23.568 --> 03:26.270
No barking.
No tackling the mailman.

03:26.337 --> 03:29.088
Here, let's see if he says no
to this awesome hole I'm digging.

03:29.156 --> 03:30.656
Marmaduke, no!

03:30.724 --> 03:34.327
See? Doctor No
in the house.

03:34.362 --> 03:36.212
Why don't you just
give it a chance?

03:36.280 --> 03:37.347
(SIGHS)

03:37.415 --> 03:39.932
I will find China!

03:40.000 --> 03:44.437
(EXCLAIMS) What you're doing
is cruel and unusual.

03:44.505 --> 03:46.272
I hate water.
Come on. Sit.

03:46.340 --> 03:47.741
Look, everybody's got a weakness. Sit.

03:47.808 --> 03:50.109
Mine's water. It's my kryptonite. Sit.

03:50.177 --> 03:53.212
Not sitting in this tub.
Sit, sit, sit.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.215
Sit, Marmaduke!

03:55.283 --> 03:57.551
What can I say? I'm
a sucker for the kid.

03:57.751 --> 03:59.002
Bye-bye.

03:59.070 --> 04:00.971
Phil hates that.

04:01.038 --> 04:02.305
Hey, Sarah,
where you going?

04:02.373 --> 04:03.873
Stay.

04:03.941 --> 04:08.311
There's nothing good about
getting a bath, except for this!

04:08.379 --> 04:10.030
Come on, Phil!
Not again.

04:10.097 --> 04:11.364
Marmaduke!

04:11.399 --> 04:12.733
Let's go! (WHOOPS)

04:12.800 --> 04:14.117
Marmaduke!

04:14.185 --> 04:16.002
I like to give Phil
a little exercise, too.

04:16.036 --> 04:19.454
He's cooped up in the office
all day. Come on, Phil.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.158
That's the spirit!
Get back here!

04:21.225 --> 04:22.342
Over here!

04:22.410 --> 04:25.395
Come here, through here,
Phil! I'm over here!

04:25.462 --> 04:26.963
Yeah, come on!

04:28.065 --> 04:30.283
Not this time...

04:30.351 --> 04:32.035
You don't grab a tiger
by the tail!

04:32.103 --> 04:33.369
(SCREAMING)

04:35.156 --> 04:36.206
Marmaduke!

04:36.274 --> 04:38.508
Someone call the ASPCA!

04:38.575 --> 04:40.860
We got a crazy dog
on the loose!

04:40.928 --> 04:42.529
Freedom!

04:42.597 --> 04:43.814
(GROANS)

04:43.881 --> 04:45.215
(SIGHS)

04:46.484 --> 04:48.418
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing?

04:50.154 --> 04:53.373
(GROANING) Would it kill them
to install a new dog door?

04:53.440 --> 04:56.142
I was two months old
when they got this.

04:56.210 --> 05:00.113
I guess I had more pull before
the growth spurt. Cue flashback.

05:00.180 --> 05:01.415
Oh, he's so cute!

05:01.482 --> 05:04.550
(CHUCKLES)
See? Insanely cute.

05:04.618 --> 05:06.786
Look at that lovable
little Marma-pup.

05:06.788 --> 05:08.989
Come here, you!

05:09.156 --> 05:12.959
But when you grow up into
this, I get it. Not pretty.

05:13.027 --> 05:14.661
I'd ignore me, too.
Get back here!

05:14.729 --> 05:16.730
Hey, I'm talking here!

05:18.549 --> 05:21.318
Anyway, I try not to
hold things against Phil.

05:21.386 --> 05:23.120
After all,
he's only human.

05:23.187 --> 05:27.491
That's why I make it a point
to never go to bed hungry.

05:27.526 --> 05:28.942
Let's see
what we've got.

05:29.010 --> 05:30.811
Sausage from
last week's barbecue,

05:30.878 --> 05:32.896
gonna need to let that
breathe a few days.

05:32.963 --> 05:36.966
This is our shot.
California, the big leagues.

05:37.034 --> 05:40.303
In the big leagues, they take
steroids and cheat with supermodels.

05:40.338 --> 05:42.972
It's a marketing job with
an organic pet food company.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.840
I think we'll be okay.

05:44.908 --> 05:47.260
(SNIFFING)
Pepperoni pizza.

05:47.327 --> 05:49.696
Phil's loafer? No, I'll
save it for dessert.

05:49.764 --> 05:52.565
And that, I have no idea what that is.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.617
Aren't we okay
in Kansas?

05:54.685 --> 05:58.221
Is that what we wanna be? Just okay?

05:58.289 --> 05:59.656
Coming in for a landing.

05:59.724 --> 06:01.758
I wanna give you and the
kids the life you deserve.

06:02.910 --> 06:04.310
I want a bigger house

06:04.378 --> 06:06.262
with a bedroom that doesn't
smell like a meat-locker.

06:06.330 --> 06:07.864
(LAUGHS)

06:08.633 --> 06:11.017
This is our shot.

06:11.084 --> 06:14.453
Well, if this is our shot,
then we should take it.

06:14.522 --> 06:16.823
But you have to
tell the kids.

06:16.891 --> 06:17.907
Done.

06:17.975 --> 06:19.125
(CHOMPING)

06:19.193 --> 06:20.226
Give me that.

06:20.294 --> 06:21.911
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:21.946 --> 06:23.463
Hey, I wasn't done
with that!

06:23.530 --> 06:26.950
You don't have to worry, I've
got my supermodel right here.

06:27.018 --> 06:28.935
Wow!

06:29.003 --> 06:32.005
Wait for it...
Wait for it...

06:32.072 --> 06:33.206
(MARMADUKE FARTS LOUDLY)

06:33.273 --> 06:34.741
Marmaduke!
Marmaduke!

06:34.809 --> 06:36.560
What did you eat?
(GROANS)

06:37.427 --> 06:38.845
(CHUCKLING)

06:38.913 --> 06:42.048
I know it's juvenile,
but it's all I've got.

06:42.115 --> 06:43.315
So, there you have it.

06:43.383 --> 06:45.518
Day in the life of
old Marmaduke, here.

06:45.586 --> 06:46.820
It's really bad!

06:46.887 --> 06:47.987
Guys, I am sorry.

06:48.022 --> 06:50.640
That was a little much,
even for me.

06:50.707 --> 06:51.907
Bad Marmaduke.

06:51.975 --> 06:54.244
All right, enough.
Lights out.

06:58.849 --> 07:02.068
(CHANTING) Waffles, waffles,
waffles, waffles, waffles!

07:02.503 --> 07:04.003
Yes!

07:04.071 --> 07:06.323
Saturday morning waffles!
Got to love the Debster!

07:06.390 --> 07:07.890
(WITH SPANISH ACCENT)
Take it easy, man!

07:07.959 --> 07:10.659
A waffle is to be
savored, not inhaled!

07:10.694 --> 07:12.562
Hey, this is my step-bro,
Carlos, by the way.

07:12.630 --> 07:14.297
Say hey, Carlos.
Hey, Carlos.

07:14.364 --> 07:16.282
He's pretty cool
for a cat, which helps,

07:16.349 --> 07:19.285
since he's basically
my only friend.

07:19.370 --> 07:20.871
You ready for
a bombshell?

07:20.938 --> 07:21.854
Lay it on me.

07:21.922 --> 07:24.508
Phil just told everybody
he got a new job.

07:24.575 --> 07:26.176
We're moving
to the O.C.!

07:26.243 --> 07:28.144
Shut up! Really?

07:28.179 --> 07:31.864
No lie! I was so shocked,
I hacked that thing up.

07:31.933 --> 07:34.351
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)
Carlos, that's gross!

07:34.418 --> 07:36.052
I know it's gonna take
time to adjust, honey,

07:36.119 --> 07:38.621
but you'll make so many
new friends there.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.707
I think it sounds
kind of cool.

07:40.775 --> 07:42.876
What do you care? All you
do is play video games.

07:42.944 --> 07:44.243
This is so unfair!

07:44.311 --> 07:45.912
I got to say,
I'm with Barbara on this one.

07:45.980 --> 07:48.414
You know how many bones
I buried in the backyard?

07:48.482 --> 07:51.268
Guys, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

07:51.335 --> 07:54.386
We'll have a big new house
with a pool and a company car.

07:57.742 --> 07:59.609
(SIGHS)

07:59.677 --> 08:02.011
Pets are always
the last to find out!

08:02.079 --> 08:04.614
I don't even know
where the O.C.'s at!

08:04.682 --> 08:07.133
(CALIFORNIA PLAYING)

08:07.200 --> 08:09.168
Okay, what's the deal?
Is it something I said?

08:09.169 --> 08:11.938
Something you weren't
supposed to say.

08:12.005 --> 08:14.407
Does anyone even own
a pet in this place?

08:14.474 --> 08:17.010
I haven't seen
a single dog so far.

08:17.077 --> 08:18.794
It's kind of hard to forgive
you if you don't mean it...

08:18.862 --> 08:20.513
Oh! She's fine.

08:20.580 --> 08:23.616
Okay, so far, all I've
learned about The O.C. is that

08:23.684 --> 08:27.219
no one has a pet and Seth,
here, is a total drama queen.

08:27.287 --> 08:29.455
You're the biggest
drama queen, amigo.

08:29.523 --> 08:31.557
(SCOFFS) Me?
That's you, Carlos.

08:31.625 --> 08:34.894
You're, like, 200 pounds
of drama, with a red collar!

08:34.962 --> 08:37.596
Oh, really?
This conversation is over.

08:37.664 --> 08:38.698
No, no, no!

08:38.765 --> 08:40.533
(CARLOS SCREECHING)

08:40.601 --> 08:42.836
Ejector seat.
Never fails.

08:44.572 --> 08:47.173
And so,
moving day arrived.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.942
And there was
a feeling of hope

08:49.009 --> 08:51.077
and excitement for
the whole family.

08:51.144 --> 08:53.780
Even Barbara was trying
to lend a hand.

08:53.848 --> 08:55.348
That's mine...

08:55.415 --> 08:56.732
Carlos and I would
have pitched in, too,

08:56.767 --> 09:00.737
(ANGRILY) but we were being
shipped air freight and on lockdown!

09:00.804 --> 09:02.955
Hey, let me out of here.
I'm not an animal!

09:04.658 --> 09:05.758
Oh, yeah, I am.

09:05.826 --> 09:09.746
Look what I got.
Debbie's meatballs!

09:09.814 --> 09:11.230
That's my man, Phil!

09:11.298 --> 09:12.782
There you go.

09:12.849 --> 09:15.351
Looking out
for his own.

09:15.419 --> 09:18.154
I don't know, Carlos.
Something's fishy here.

09:18.222 --> 09:20.673
(MUFFLED) It's Debbie's
meatballs, man. Don't question it!

09:20.708 --> 09:23.592
Oh! I know I shouldn't eat
it, but I can't help it.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.462
Good boy! Good boy!

09:27.665 --> 09:29.532
(MUFFLED)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

09:35.022 --> 09:37.556
I feel a little funny.

09:37.624 --> 09:39.575
This is
a horrible mistake.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.527
I requested
executive class!

09:41.595 --> 09:44.697
I think Phil put something
in our meatballs!

09:44.765 --> 09:47.734
Have you ever
looked at your paws?

09:47.801 --> 09:50.469
I mean,
really looked at them?

09:50.537 --> 09:53.439
Yeah, yeah. I followed
you on many adventures.

09:53.507 --> 09:57.744
But into the great unknown
mystery, I will go first, amigo.

check out that doggie door?

It fits! It fits!
Oh! Look at this.

10:47.645 --> 10:50.913
It's got an ocean view!

a little privacy, please.

that'll bring out my eyes.

11:06.897 --> 11:09.399
Is that weird that your boss
wants to meet you at the dog park?

That's how
they roll in Cali.

28:40.133 --> 28:42.600
I'd be a bone-illionaire!

28:42.668 --> 28:46.638
Just once in my life, I'd
like to fit in, you know?

28:46.705 --> 28:50.759
Look, I know what it's
like to be an outsider.

28:50.827 --> 28:54.395
Okay? I was a rescue dog.
Nobody wanted me.

28:54.464 --> 28:57.699
But you're better than any of
those guys, and I can prove it.

28:57.767 --> 29:00.736
I can make you into
the dog you wanna be.

29:00.803 --> 29:04.055
Really? Why would
you do that for me?

29:04.123 --> 29:05.957
Because you're my friend.

Wait, what time is it?

29:09.679 --> 29:11.830
Oh, man, Phil's gonna
get up soon. I got to go!

29:11.897 --> 29:13.665
I'll see you later!

29:32.451 --> 29:33.919
I just made it.

29:39.559 --> 29:42.494
(SIGHS) I am beat.
I am so tired.

29:44.163 --> 29:45.797
I'm exhausted.

Oh! Phil,
hit the snooze!

Time for work,

you're killing me.

29:58.677 --> 30:01.646
I need that new campaign and I need
it yesterday. So what do you got?

30:01.713 --> 30:03.765
Yeah. I got some
great ideas percolating,

30:03.833 --> 30:05.533
I just need a little
time to flesh them out.

30:05.601 --> 30:06.934
See, you got nothing.

30:07.002 --> 30:10.639
No, you can count on me.
It's gonna be a home run.

30:10.990 --> 30:11.689
It better be.

30:11.757 --> 30:12.957
Yeah, bye.

Get back.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.203
Bee! Bee!
He's gonna sting us!

I am?

30:42.321 --> 30:44.305

for dogs?

friend surfing towards shore,

30:47.360 --> 30:49.594
throngs of owners
cheering them on.

30:49.662 --> 30:52.247
How's that gonna sell organic
dog food to the heartland?

30:52.315 --> 30:53.815
Eleven o'clock, Phil.

30:53.883 --> 30:57.219

to be myself?

one shot with PETCO.

trust me on this.

Yes!

have dental hygienists, all right?

So garbage breath
is not gonna cut it.

eat more mint-based items.

more mint.

38:30.339 --> 38:31.856
Sure, I'd love to.

38:33.792 --> 38:36.260
Competition's starting.
Beat it, Hasselhoff.

38:37.412 --> 38:39.446
(WHISPERS) Dad,
what are you doing?

38:39.514 --> 38:42.049
You're way too young, and I'm way
too busy to talk about this right now.

38:42.051 --> 38:43.551
(SCOFFS)

38:43.619 --> 38:45.670
And, just put
some clothes on.

38:45.738 --> 38:47.371
Can I get you
anything, Deb?

38:51.410 --> 38:52.910
He's cute!

38:55.447 --> 38:58.248
Hey, Marmaduke,
can you keep a secret?

38:59.117 --> 39:00.601
Probably.

39:01.904 --> 39:05.940
I've been telling Dad
I'm going to soccer practice,

39:06.008 --> 39:08.776
but I've actually been
hanging out at the skate park.

39:08.844 --> 39:10.778
I think that
sounds cool, Brian.

39:10.846 --> 39:12.647
But you got to
tell your dad.

39:12.714 --> 39:15.783
I don't even
like soccer.

39:15.851 --> 39:18.686
I guess I just don't know
how to tell him the truth.

39:18.753 --> 39:21.789
I hear you, bro,
but just hang in there.

39:22.525 --> 39:25.342
I wish you could talk.

39:25.410 --> 39:28.412
And I wish you could
understand me.

39:28.714 --> 39:30.265
Come on, Marmaduke!

39:30.332 --> 39:32.383
Hey, Brian, you okay?
Yeah.

39:32.451 --> 39:35.403
What do you say we kick
that ball around later?

39:35.471 --> 39:37.421
No, I'm good.

39:37.489 --> 39:38.672
Come on, buddy.
Wait! Phil! Phil!

39:38.740 --> 39:42.076
Hold on, Phil. Brian's
got something to tell you.

39:45.297 --> 39:49.984
It is a beautiful day here in
Southern California for dog surfing.

39:50.052 --> 39:53.855
Please, put your paws together
for our canine competitors!

39:53.922 --> 39:56.674
Aha! And here's our marketing
director, Phil Winslow.

39:56.741 --> 39:59.843
Phil, this is David King,
Jessica Colestat from PETCO.

39:59.911 --> 40:01.462
Pleased to meet you.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.732
I hope you're ready for a
mind-blowing canine surf experience.

40:04.800 --> 40:08.035
(LAUGHS) Wow! Can't wait to see
this big guy out on the waves!

40:08.103 --> 40:09.470
No, no, no.

40:09.538 --> 40:12.023
Phil and Marmaduke are one
month removed from Kansas.

40:12.091 --> 40:13.758
I don't think they're ready to hang 10.

40:13.826 --> 40:16.076
Well, that's too bad. That
would've been hysterical.

40:16.145 --> 40:17.845
Yeah!

40:17.846 --> 40:22.016
(STAMMERS) No, you're right!
That would be hysterical! Phil?

40:22.083 --> 40:25.086
Phil, come on, they're
just kidding. Say no!

40:26.722 --> 40:28.556
Marmaduke's dying
to hang 20.

40:28.624 --> 40:29.824
Dying to.

40:29.891 --> 40:31.809
Oh! We're dead!

40:31.877 --> 40:33.027

No. Way too big and
too wet! Cold, cold!

a chance, Shamu.

Nothing bad's gonna happen.

Phil. Payback's gonna hurt.

a look, on the horizon,

you doing? Phil, help me.

anything, Bosco!

the park should be.

claim this spot for all the dogs

I am for the way I've been acting.

I thought I was fired.

01:20:26.451 --> 01:20:28.151
Don't be so sensitive.

01:20:28.219 --> 01:20:30.387
Any man that chooses
his dog over his career

01:20:30.455 --> 01:20:32.872
is a man I want
working for me.

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:36.476
Besides, have you seen the video of
you rescuing Marmaduke on YouTube?

01:20:36.544 --> 01:20:37.811
Nah.

01:20:37.879 --> 01:20:40.313
Six hundred and eighty-two
thousand hits so far.

01:20:40.381 --> 01:20:41.298
We got PETCO!

01:20:41.365 --> 01:20:43.400
Are you serious?
Totally!

01:20:43.467 --> 01:20:44.385
(LAUGHS)

01:20:44.452 --> 01:20:45.919
We're gonna sell
a lot of dog food!

01:20:45.987 --> 01:20:47.037
Wow!

01:20:47.105 --> 01:20:48.805
Come on, walk with me.
We got work to do.

01:20:48.873 --> 01:20:49.940
I can't.

01:20:50.007 --> 01:20:51.241
Why?

01:20:51.309 --> 01:20:52.943
'Cause I made plans
with my family.

01:20:53.011 --> 01:20:57.414
Who? Oh. All right.
All right, tomorrow.

01:20:57.966 --> 01:20:59.333
Monday.

01:21:00.752 --> 01:21:02.719
Monday. Deal.

01:21:03.088 --> 01:21:04.021
Deal.

01:21:05.172 --> 01:21:07.474
Don't push it, okay?

01:21:08.326 --> 01:21:10.528
Okay, I'm just
spit-balling here

01:21:10.595 --> 01:21:13.631
but what if the dogs
could talk to each other?

01:21:14.666 --> 01:21:15.966
I don't really buy it.

01:21:17.636 --> 01:21:19.637
What if they
could dance?

01:21:19.704 --> 01:21:22.139

01:22:24.636 --> 01:22:26.102
It's still pretty
rough. What do you think?

01:22:26.170 --> 01:22:28.037
I love it!
Great job.

01:22:28.105 --> 01:22:29.539
Thanks, Deb.

01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:39.599
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

01:22:40.635 --> 01:22:41.935
(FARTS LOUDLY)

01:22:42.003 --> 01:22:44.646
Oh! Marmaduke!
What did you eat?

01:22:44.681 --> 01:22:47.290
Man, you got
a serious problem.

01:22:47.358 --> 01:22:49.159
(LAUGHS)
It never gets old!
