00:01.349 --> 00:03.462
It's quite common for mortals to react

00:03.538 --> 00:06.886
in a negative way
when they discover
that their beloved is a witch.

00:06.911 --> 00:09.002
Eh, Sheala, why don't you share

00:09.003 --> 00:10.414
your experience with the group?

00:10.515 --> 00:12.006
David's madly in love with me

00:12.007 --> 00:13.638
until he found out I was two-faced.

00:16.262 --> 00:17.766
How about you, Sabrina?

00:17.794 --> 00:19.237
You've spent all summer trying to get over

00:19.238 --> 00:21.178
your break-up with Harvey?
How do you feel?

00:21.590 --> 00:23.607
I just feel so confused!

00:23.608 --> 00:25.222
There's like a game of emotional

00:25.223 --> 00:26.623
ping-pong going on in my head.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.620
Can't believe Harvey is so dumb
just to break up because I'm a witch.

00:29.662 --> 00:32.403
He is a selfish, manipulative egomaniac.

00:32.430 --> 00:35.550
No, he wasn't.
He was a sweet puppy dog
that would've followed you anywhere.

00:35.658 --> 00:37.060
And he didn't shed.

00:37.161 --> 00:39.548
You're right. I guess you call him.

00:39.609 --> 00:40.998
Don't bother. It's over.

00:41.099 --> 00:42.449
You're dead to him.

00:43.662 --> 00:45.142
Nice shot.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.172
You're bound to be conflicted.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.434
Wounds of a heart take time to heal.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.299
Tell me about it.

00:53.444 --> 00:56.300
Harvey was my best friend, my soulmate.

00:56.358 --> 00:58.602
Yet to him, you were nothing but a cat.

01:02.322 --> 01:05.470
Doctor Witchfield, how am I supposed to start college and get up my life

01:05.506 --> 01:06.882
if I can't stop thinking of Harvey?

01:07.331 --> 01:08.681
The truth is that you made a lot of progress

01:08.716 --> 01:10.953
over the summer
- Yeah, guess I have.

01:11.401 --> 01:13.463
Maybe, all I need now is some closure.

01:13.608 --> 01:15.904
Words, empty words.

01:16.446 --> 01:18.230
All you need now is some shock therapy.

01:18.715 --> 01:20.079
- Yeah?
- You're ready for closure.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.900
All is left you to do
is to go throug the final screen.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.837
See, if you can watch Harvey

01:25.838 --> 01:27.957
without having your heart aches.

01:27.958 --> 01:29.564
One last chance to be in his arms.

01:31.853 --> 01:34.019
We were fine. Nothing is aching.

01:34.020 --> 01:35.802
Although, suddenly I'm in the mood

01:35.803 --> 01:37.153
for a barn raising.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.808
Uh, sorry, that's the wrong video.
Ah, here. Try this one.

01:44.144 --> 01:47.273
Oh, not as easy. He was a good kisser.

01:49.058 --> 01:52.403
- Hey, you know what? I'm okay.
- Congratulations, Sabrina!

01:52.405 --> 01:53.848
You passed the test.

01:54.028 --> 01:55.515
What a relief! I made it!

01:55.616 --> 01:57.576
I'm finally really ready to let him go.

01:57.649 --> 01:59.752
Don't leave me, Harvey! Noo!

02:01.625 --> 02:03.410
Somebody, catch me!

02:03.411 --> 02:04.761
Don't go, Harvey...

02:10.132 --> 02:13.261
Sabrina, the Teenage Witch
S05E01 - Every Witch Way but Loose

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

02:43.066 --> 02:45.353
Eight and a half feet.
Eh, eight...

02:45.874 --> 02:47.767
Zelda, what are you doing?

02:48.320 --> 02:50.105
- Nothing.
- You jumped.

02:50.106 --> 02:52.206
For joy when I saw you.

02:54.732 --> 02:56.224
You were measuring behind my back.

02:56.325 --> 02:57.764
You were going to redecorate

02:57.865 --> 02:59.310
Sabrina's room without me.

02:59.698 --> 03:01.048
I didn't think you'd mind.

03:01.275 --> 03:02.931
- Why not?
- Because you are a kind

03:02.932 --> 03:05.018
and giving person.
And you have

03:05.019 --> 03:07.135
no taste.
- I have empathical taste.

03:07.405 --> 03:09.404
As the way you've decorated your bedroom:

03:09.843 --> 03:11.853
south-western Mr. Fo chinese.

03:11.854 --> 03:14.597
I call it "Cassadei Feng Shui".

03:15.547 --> 03:17.914
Hilda, Sabrina is going to college now.

03:17.915 --> 03:19.753
She needs a room

03:19.754 --> 03:21.576
where she can do a serious study.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.717
And what project did you have in mind?

03:27.658 --> 03:29.463
Oh, I see. You'd like Sabrina to spent

03:29.464 --> 03:31.215
her college years living in a mortuary.

03:31.924 --> 03:33.935
I'm not done yet. I'm getting her

03:33.912 --> 03:37.790
a beautiful inkwell.
- Inkwell? Uuh,

03:37.815 --> 03:41.015
how awkward? I personally think

03:41.050 --> 03:42.543
that Sabrina would be more comfortable living in a room

03:42.578 --> 03:44.850
like the one I had during my academic years.

03:44.889 --> 03:46.457
You went to a clown college.

03:46.458 --> 03:47.808
University!

03:49.806 --> 03:51.746
Graduated magnicum self-eter.

03:54.298 --> 03:56.035
Back in the box, chuckles!

03:57.367 --> 03:59.960
There's no use arguing.
Sabrina's room. We should let her decide

04:00.017 --> 04:02.552
how she wants to decorate.
- Fine.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.454
I'm confident that Sabrina is mature enough

04:06.455 --> 04:07.805
to make the right choice.

04:08.394 --> 04:09.744
I heard that.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.948
You're all a bunch of whiny psychos!

04:13.507 --> 04:16.140
Uhh, I could not take those nutcases anymore!

04:16.141 --> 04:17.752
- They kicked him out?
- Yep, they

04:17.767 --> 04:20.964
though his obsession with Harvey
was border on psychotic.
And they caught him

04:20.988 --> 04:22.838
 stealing sweet love.
- You'll thank me

04:22.958 --> 04:24.392
at breakfast.

04:24.493 --> 04:26.159
More importantly, how are you doing?

04:26.651 --> 04:28.202
Okay, I think I'm finally

04:28.235 --> 04:30.175
over Harvey.
- Really? After all he ment to you?

04:30.267 --> 04:31.682
You two were so close

04:31.775 --> 04:33.125
for so many... too many years

04:33.234 --> 04:34.877
I'm exhausted.

04:34.912 --> 04:36.586
I just wanna go lie down and take a nap

04:36.621 --> 04:37.993
in my nice cousy room.

04:41.519 --> 04:42.982
Okay, here is what I can use as a Plan B.

04:43.189 --> 04:45.155
We each wanna to redecorate your room.

04:45.738 --> 04:47.786
So, just tell us which half you like best.

04:47.813 --> 04:49.398
Dark, taint and dreary

04:49.399 --> 04:51.973
or the greatest room on Earth?

04:51.974 --> 04:54.608
- Neither.
- Oh, honey, I know you love

04:54.633 --> 04:56.003
your old room but now

04:56.080 --> 04:57.670
you are starting college. Maybe,

04:57.692 --> 05:00.341
it's time for a change?
- I agree.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.795
And I've been thinking about it a lot.
And... I wanna move out.

05:04.154 --> 05:05.585
- What?
- Where?

05:05.686 --> 05:07.870
- I wanna live at college like a normal freshman.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.947
Our own crib on campus?

05:10.377 --> 05:11.727
Keg party!

05:12.772 --> 05:14.999
Sabrina, this is very sad.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.906
You never mentioned moving out before.

05:16.989 --> 05:18.837
Well, I didn't know how to tell you. And I knew

05:18.838 --> 05:22.609
you'd be upset and beg me not to go.
So, go ahead let's get it over with.

05:22.634 --> 05:24.791
Sabrina, I'm only gonna say this once.

05:25.272 --> 05:26.622
A younger unleashes her freedom

05:26.695 --> 05:28.125
and I need a room for kickboxing.

05:28.257 --> 05:29.659
How soon does the school start?

05:29.729 --> 05:32.475
- Hilda!
- Oh, c'mon, you remember us at Sabrina's age?

05:32.510 --> 05:33.860
Yeah, you must've been young once.

05:34.537 --> 05:37.088
Was that before or after
they invented fire?

05:37.743 --> 05:40.025
- I hope you're happy.
- Of course, I'm happy.

05:40.060 --> 05:42.447
I won the last 3 games.
King man.

05:42.448 --> 05:44.893
I'm talking about Sabrina living on her own

05:44.870 --> 05:47.316
in a mortal realm.
Remember how painful

05:47.341 --> 05:49.000
that transition was.

05:49.025 --> 05:51.083
I give you painful?
Haven't listen to you two

05:51.094 --> 05:53.349
empty belly ackles all day.

05:53.350 --> 05:56.032
I think this sweater is too snug.

05:56.132 --> 05:57.488
It could be a little tigher around your neck.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.184
Look, Sabrina is going to college across the town.

06:01.185 --> 06:03.039
She can come and visit whenever she wants.

06:04.020 --> 06:05.370
What if she doesn't want to?

06:06.895 --> 06:10.590
Well, I'm sure she'll call whenever she has time.
She won't have any time.

06:10.632 --> 06:12.446
'cause she will be in college.
All the way

06:12.474 --> 06:14.679
across the town.
Zelda, what have you done?

06:14.680 --> 06:16.091
Ew?

06:17.459 --> 06:20.284
Oh, Hilda, we just have to hope that Sabrina will come

06:20.319 --> 06:22.676
to reconciliation realized

06:22.677 --> 06:24.509
that she will miss us as much
as we will miss her

06:24.510 --> 06:26.200
Ain't gonna happen, sister.

06:26.201 --> 06:28.198
She's grown up, moving out

06:28.694 --> 06:30.782
and I'm riding shotgun on contenders.

06:34.344 --> 06:37.000
Oh, I don't know,
it depends how Sabrina's feeling.

06:37.025 --> 06:39.270
If she seems receptive
I will ask her or else.

06:39.309 --> 06:42.234
You rock, coffee boy.

06:43.557 --> 06:45.960
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Hey, Josh.

06:45.961 --> 06:47.836
- How are you doing?
- Ah, never better.

06:47.878 --> 06:49.824
Decided to make a life change.

06:49.912 --> 06:52.256
Clean break and start fresh.

06:52.257 --> 06:55.862
That's fantastic.
Exactly what I was hoping for.

06:55.897 --> 06:57.790
So, you've got any plans for the weekend?

06:57.825 --> 06:59.870
Yes, I do. I'm gonna pack all my stuff
and moving

06:59.890 --> 07:02.252
to my new dorm.
- How sweet.

07:02.253 --> 07:03.914
- Which one did you get into?
- I don't know

07:03.901 --> 07:06.521
I haven't signed up yet.
- Sabrina, your school starts

07:06.546 --> 07:08.294
next Tuesday.
These dorms are

07:08.335 --> 07:09.685
 filled months in advance.
- Really?

07:09.851 --> 07:13.195
I wonder where all packages from the Housing Office I want to fetch.

07:13.762 --> 07:16.064
Probably, you'll have to get
on a waiting list to get on a waiting list.

07:16.075 --> 07:18.079
Or maybe they just let
the really cool people in?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.172
I guess this doesn't
help me either.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.917
Well, you never know,
a room could open up.

07:22.918 --> 07:25.269
I mean, some incoming freshman
can be hit by a bus.

07:26.519 --> 07:28.650
He won't be dead or anything.
He just starts school

07:28.651 --> 07:30.001
next year.

07:30.606 --> 07:31.956
Sabrina, I don't mean to sound negative,

07:32.135 --> 07:34.173
but your chances of getting a room
are slim to none.

07:34.198 --> 07:36.531
Less than zero.
No way, nohow.

07:36.532 --> 07:38.962
Thank you very much, Josh.
But you know what? I came here totally jazzed

07:38.963 --> 07:41.080
now spiralling into a
black hole.

07:41.081 --> 07:44.455
Oh, no, no, no,
don't go there. If you are in a black hole

07:44.490 --> 07:46.456
than you won't be in the mood
to go out on a date.

07:46.457 --> 07:47.857
What are you talking about?
I barely over

07:47.966 --> 07:49.751
Harvey. What kind of loser
wanna date a woman

07:49.778 --> 07:51.352
on a rebound?

07:51.387 --> 07:52.737
No one I know.

07:57.005 --> 07:58.388
Where do you think you are going with that?

07:58.497 --> 07:59.897
A college guy needs his toast.

07:59.990 --> 08:01.395
- And how are we supposed

08:01.496 --> 08:03.150
 to get our mail from the other realm?

08:03.177 --> 08:05.392
Can I use a
"Not my problem."?

08:05.427 --> 08:07.904
No, but I can say,
"Not your toaster.".

08:09.379 --> 08:11.662
Kit's been trying to steel our appliances

08:11.687 --> 08:13.981
and take them off to college.
- No doubt

08:13.982 --> 08:15.987
the same slug has packed my hair rollers

08:15.965 --> 08:17.371
in his duffle bag.

08:17.396 --> 08:20.936
I like to pet them on the floor.
For excercise.

08:22.406 --> 08:24.871
That's my story.
And I'm sticking to it.

08:24.872 --> 08:28.107
- Hi.
- Sabrina, what's wrong?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.923
There is no room
at the dorm.

08:29.924 --> 08:32.730
So, all student housing can do
is to put my name on the waiting list.

08:32.759 --> 08:35.059
Sabrina, that's fant... terrible.

08:35.061 --> 08:37.996
Oh, honey.
I know you must be terribly disappointed.

08:39.004 --> 08:41.275
Her? I've got a mover coming in a minute

08:41.311 --> 08:44.044
to pick up an ottoman.
- Well, the good news is

08:44.044 --> 08:45.534
you still have a place to stay.

08:45.569 --> 08:47.226
And if a room becomes available

08:47.245 --> 08:51.219
you can move into the dorm next year.
- Or the year after that. Or the year after that.

08:51.244 --> 08:53.836
By than you will be sucked into the tangled web.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.912
Your precious freedom

08:55.913 --> 08:57.824
a distant dream.
- I have a dream,

08:57.825 --> 08:59.504
and in it you are a zippo's lining.

08:59.564 --> 09:02.464
Sounds right.
If I wanna live on my own,

09:02.499 --> 09:03.849
it's up to me to make it happen.

09:04.684 --> 09:06.084
I'll just have to go out
and find an appartment.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.790
So, what if the only appartments available

09:07.767 --> 09:11.143
are in dangerous neighborhood?
- The only way to find out

09:11.168 --> 09:12.616
is to get out there and look.

09:12.693 --> 09:14.980
Discover every classified, knock on every door.

09:15.005 --> 09:18.158
Lucky for you,
you are looking at couple of great knockers.

09:20.061 --> 09:21.839
There's a small studio appartment

09:21.840 --> 09:25.224
in that building over there.
Looks like a nice neighborhood.

09:25.225 --> 09:28.012
But there is trash. All over the street.

09:28.047 --> 09:31.235
- There's one gum wrapper.
- Don't take the wrapper

09:31.270 --> 09:33.011
but look for inns.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.343
They say it's a very bad luck

09:37.444 --> 09:38.947
to take the first place's ad.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.592
But look at it, 20 bucks for that...

09:41.899 --> 09:43.764
"Shmolex"?

09:43.810 --> 09:45.818
That last place that we looked

09:45.819 --> 09:47.338
was exactly not in the best location.

09:47.795 --> 09:50.439
As soon as the light in here?

09:52.699 --> 09:55.091
Light doesn't really work for me
because I'm nocturnal.

10:03.725 --> 10:06.757
What it doesn't have is a roof around the sky light.

10:09.830 --> 10:12.417
Hey, this is cute.
And look, there is a

10:13.418 --> 10:14.768
tub in the kitchen.

10:15.588 --> 10:18.908
And it is full of cockroaches!
Wait a minute.

10:19.773 --> 10:21.437
I think their virtue is at spelling of the word "hi".

10:21.462 --> 10:24.080
I can't believe it is as hard

10:24.091 --> 10:25.857
to find an appartment. I mean each one is worse

10:25.892 --> 10:27.692
than the next.
Like someone's

10:27.787 --> 10:29.235
flatting against me.
- Who would do that?

10:29.236 --> 10:31.536
Why would you think that?
Huh? Huh? Huh?

10:31.537 --> 10:33.746
- Aunt Hilda!
- It was her idea!

10:33.813 --> 10:35.218
- Aunt Zelda!
- We have the right

10:35.219 --> 10:36.569
to remain silent.

10:39.257 --> 10:42.177
Hey, trying to order some school supplies here.

10:43.169 --> 10:44.753
I'll take a case of number 2 pencils

10:44.786 --> 10:46.849
and a bottle of perming cream.

10:47.717 --> 10:49.573
Honey, I know you are angry.

10:50.173 --> 10:51.978
But we acted out of love.
- You were

10:51.979 --> 10:53.638
sneaky and dishonest.

10:53.639 --> 10:55.223
In a loving nurturing way.

10:55.993 --> 10:58.573
Sabrina, we just hated the part of your leaving.

10:58.794 --> 11:00.426
Hold on,
get another call coming in.

11:01.903 --> 11:03.440
It's Dean's Housing Office.
Will she

11:03.520 --> 11:05.730
 have to get back to you?
- Give me that.
- Hello

11:05.770 --> 11:07.120
This is Sabrina Spellman.

11:07.578 --> 11:09.800
Really? Something open up on campus?

11:09.835 --> 11:11.777
Does it have four walls and a ceiling?

11:11.812 --> 11:13.527
Nobody got hit by a bus

11:13.562 --> 11:16.383
today?
Great, I'll take it.

11:22.887 --> 11:25.303
Look, the house is owned by the school.

11:25.328 --> 11:27.740
It's two blocks from campus.
You can't possibly object.

11:27.811 --> 11:29.313
You can drop me off and have your place stuff

11:29.314 --> 11:31.729
but I don't wanna point or pin
out of either of you.

11:31.830 --> 11:33.230
Face it, aunties.

11:33.331 --> 11:36.134
It's time to let us live our own lives.
- Salem,

11:36.169 --> 11:37.867
along those lines,
most of the students

11:38.024 --> 11:39.374
don't go to college with the talking cat.

11:39.375 --> 11:41.873
Giving you the clear advantage?

11:41.874 --> 11:43.883
I'm sorry. You can't come with me.

11:43.908 --> 11:46.308
Oh, please, please, please, don't leave me
with these rigid...

11:47.930 --> 11:49.508
Goddesses.

11:49.519 --> 11:52.565
Okay, well, thanks for you help.
I'll cal

11:52.590 --> 11:54.180
 once I get setteled.
- You are sure

11:54.181 --> 11:55.742
you don't want us to come in

11:55.777 --> 11:57.127
and take a look around?

11:58.078 --> 11:59.428
I'll take it as a "no".

12:00.809 --> 12:03.420
Hi, you must be the new girl Sabrina.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.731
And you must be her aunts,
Hilda and Zelda?

12:06.759 --> 12:08.441
And you must be a clairvoyant?

12:08.753 --> 12:10.913
No, I'm
Morgan Cavanaugh, RA.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.062
It's my job to know

12:13.087 --> 12:15.371
the backgrounds of the students that I look after.

12:15.372 --> 12:17.730
- Come on in.
- She invited us.

12:22.452 --> 12:24.973
- This is so cool!
- I live upstairs

12:25.023 --> 12:26.456
and Sabrina will be sharing the room

12:26.565 --> 12:29.011
down here with a wonderful girl named Roxie.
- OK,

12:29.038 --> 12:31.289
sounds great!
OK, bye guys!

12:32.124 --> 12:34.939
More. This is our niece's first time

12:34.940 --> 12:37.428
living on her own.
- You have nothing to worry about.

12:37.429 --> 12:40.865
I put in a full 24 hours. I look after these students

12:40.866 --> 12:42.792
as a favor of my own family.

12:42.827 --> 12:46.170
See? No worries. She is just as serious of curfew as you are.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.575
I make sure they get plenty of rest,

12:48.576 --> 12:51.200
they eat right and study, study, study.

12:51.201 --> 12:53.404
- Can I live here?
- Can she?

12:54.140 --> 12:56.502
- Hey, bye aunt Hilda, bye aunt Zelda.

12:57.463 --> 12:59.449
Don't you worry. I'll take good care of her.

13:02.822 --> 13:04.726
Gotta roll.
Have a date.

13:05.169 --> 13:06.658
- It's 10:30 in the morning.
- I know,

13:06.993 --> 13:09.954
I'm 30 minutes late
thank to your hawk-eye aunts.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.728
Sweet, before you go I have a good quesiton.

13:11.828 --> 13:13.231
Uh, I don't have time for questions.

13:13.332 --> 13:15.384
Wait, by far you said you are here for 24 hours.

13:15.745 --> 13:17.095
Not on the same day!

13:19.852 --> 13:25.652
My place, my chair, my...

13:26.470 --> 13:29.880
alright, it's not my CD player.
But it's in my living room.

13:40.897 --> 13:42.946
Stay right there. I'll call 911.

13:43.658 --> 13:45.145
Oh, I'm sorry. This was really strange.

13:46.097 --> 13:47.977
And I was ego psycho but it's your call.

13:48.012 --> 13:49.970
You must be Roxie, I'm Sabrina.
Your new rommate.

13:49.993 --> 13:52.013
Oh, I'm sorry. That was your CD player.

13:52.014 --> 13:54.221
I was so excited so I couldn't stand still.

13:54.222 --> 13:56.372
This place is so cool.
I never lived on my own

13:56.407 --> 13:57.793
before and I just know college

13:57.894 --> 13:59.659
is gonna be the best experience in my life.

14:01.121 --> 14:02.859
Okay, maybe second place.

14:05.079 --> 14:08.702
- Hello. Was that something I said?
- Look,

14:08.703 --> 14:10.445
you seem very nice.
- Thanks.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.469
I have no room in my life for people like that.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.059
- You're kidding, right?
- I never kid,

14:15.084 --> 14:17.865
I never giggle,
and I never dance like a bull legged chicken.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.250
C'mon you must be kidding at least once.

14:20.299 --> 14:21.764
Or not.

14:21.865 --> 14:24.972
Oh, I get it. You must be a deceptively rough type you've talked of

14:25.007 --> 14:27.056
but deep down you've got a heart of gold.

14:27.091 --> 14:28.889
I'm taking the bedroom.
You get the coach.

14:28.924 --> 14:32.134
And I'd appreciate that if you lose those perky things.

14:37.383 --> 14:40.924
- Hey, cool. We're getting a cable.
- I'm not the cable guy.

14:40.925 --> 14:42.826
I'm Miles,
I live in the bedroom across the hall.

14:42.861 --> 14:45.418
Never go in there.
- Okay.

14:45.453 --> 14:47.210
I'm Sabrina
I just moved in.

14:47.245 --> 14:49.051
So, what's all the equipment for?

14:49.086 --> 14:52.243
Oh, I work part-time for the electric company.

14:52.278 --> 14:55.442
- Doing what?
- Ahh, electric stuff.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.162
Unplugging things, plugging things in.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.002
I love plugs.

15:00.924 --> 15:03.460
Ok, I'm monitoring the Alpha Quadrant for presence of an intelligent life.

15:03.490 --> 15:06.440
The Alpha Quadrant?
Those water breezers are many light years

15:06.475 --> 15:08.528
 behind us.
- You can make fun.

15:08.529 --> 15:09.879
I know you never believe this.

15:09.886 --> 15:12.092
But our Universe is inhabitted by

15:12.117 --> 15:17.079
other forces and other beings.
- Oh, you mean like witches?

15:17.104 --> 15:20.149
Witches?
C'mon, they are better real than Easter Bunny

15:20.170 --> 15:21.585
 in the long gumming theory.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.571
Wait, wait.
Ah, Morgan

15:23.603 --> 15:25.743
said I'd share room with Roxie. But Roxie said

15:25.771 --> 15:27.537
I just sleep on a coach.
Isn't that ridiculous?

15:27.572 --> 15:29.793
Watch out for the loose spring in the last cushion.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.178
It's an eye-opener.

15:38.368 --> 15:40.479
I caught you again.
What were you doing this time?

15:41.742 --> 15:44.353
Wallowing in the misery of life without Sabrina.

15:44.398 --> 15:46.298
Wallowing?
Without me?

15:46.323 --> 15:49.359
It never fails to amaze me of the depth of your selfishness.

15:49.394 --> 15:50.824
I apologize.

15:50.867 --> 15:55.928
- You. You fall apart first.
- Thank you.

16:02.642 --> 16:05.817
Wow, so they did saved Hitler's brain.

16:05.842 --> 16:08.763
- What are you doing here?
- I came to party.

16:08.774 --> 16:11.683
But I see no signs of bubbly outrageous college lads.

16:11.733 --> 16:13.112
No offense.

16:13.198 --> 16:15.371
You have no clue of what college life is like today.

16:15.406 --> 16:18.229
I've come to learn.
Teach me the ways

16:18.264 --> 16:21.901
of your animal house.
- Well, for one thing

16:21.936 --> 16:23.895
they don't let you stay in your own bedroom.

16:23.930 --> 16:26.620
My rommate hates me and accesses me to sleep on a coach.

16:26.657 --> 16:28.462
I tried to talk to her but she doesn't even open the door.

16:28.497 --> 16:30.647
Let's see what to do...

16:30.682 --> 16:32.999
If only you were a witch...

16:33.034 --> 16:35.742
Forget it.
I'm gonna going to school in the mortal

16:35.777 --> 16:37.959
realm. I can't use the magic to solve every little problem.

16:37.994 --> 16:39.679
No wonder you are miserable,

16:39.714 --> 16:41.910
you are letting these mortals to walk all over you.

16:41.945 --> 16:43.950
Are you saying because you care or

16:43.985 --> 16:45.887
because you wanna party?
- Six of one.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.959
But point is
you've got the gift of magic.

16:48.001 --> 16:49.821
Use it or lose it.

16:49.849 --> 16:52.775
Well, I guess there is something really annoying me.

16:55.919 --> 16:59.727
- Salem?
- Uhm, what a flight?

17:06.800 --> 17:09.069
No way, I'm not of stupid Salem's level.

17:09.799 --> 17:11.148
Yet.

17:20.433 --> 17:22.608
- Hi, what's up?
- I have a little problem.

17:22.643 --> 17:24.616
So do I.
I'm on my way to a party

17:24.651 --> 17:26.472
and I can't decide which shoes to wear.

17:26.473 --> 17:30.541
- I like those red ones.
- Me too. Thanks a lot.

17:30.576 --> 17:34.253
Now about me...
Enough about me.

17:34.758 --> 17:36.749
Sabrina's first levitation.

17:36.784 --> 17:39.633
- Ah, the girl had lift!
- What girl?

17:39.668 --> 17:43.424
- Just looking the old pictures of Sabrina.
- Without me?

17:43.459 --> 17:46.850
Do you think you're more upset about her leaving than I am?

17:46.876 --> 17:49.608
Oh, how pathetic. I sound like you.

17:49.643 --> 17:51.848
I just can't go to sleep until I know she's OK.

17:51.890 --> 17:53.416
I'm sure she's fine.

17:53.444 --> 17:55.550
But then why does Salem say that she's sleeping on a coach.

17:55.582 --> 17:57.459
We should go over there and check on her.

17:57.484 --> 18:00.746
If we barge in on her she will never forgive us.

18:00.781 --> 18:02.625
You're right.
Driving over there is

18:02.660 --> 18:04.626
not the answer.

18:04.722 --> 18:06.641
We should calm down, make some tea.

18:06.642 --> 18:09.925
Exactly. And perhaps a waffle.

18:19.472 --> 18:22.300
Salem was right.
She's sleeping on the coach.

18:24.189 --> 18:25.539
Hard floor.

18:26.499 --> 18:29.653
It's no use.
I need help.

18:36.398 --> 18:39.742
The machine?
Aunt Hilda, aunt Zelda!

18:39.777 --> 18:42.223
- Where are you?
- Right where you need us, honey.

18:42.258 --> 18:43.608
- Tea.
- Waffle.

18:45.397 --> 18:47.415
You guys have been spying on me?

18:47.450 --> 18:51.343
Lucky thing. You obviously needed our help.

18:51.385 --> 18:52.942
I needed your advice on a problem,

18:53.035 --> 18:55.730
but how can I take an advice from the people I can't trust?

18:55.763 --> 18:57.930
Uh, you can trust us. We were just trying to help

18:57.962 --> 19:00.070
in our own appliance-oriented way.

19:00.071 --> 19:01.822
Salem told us what's been going on.

19:01.865 --> 19:04.518
You said you're letting your rommate to take advantage of you.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.076
Not true.
I was just about to go in

19:06.111 --> 19:08.300
and tell her I'm moving in my stuff.

19:08.335 --> 19:10.397
- Go ahead.
- I'm going.

19:11.997 --> 19:13.646
Maybe, you just need a little push.

19:21.405 --> 19:23.421
- Hey, sleeping in here. Too bad

19:23.456 --> 19:24.806
I'm coming in.

19:26.294 --> 19:27.829
I thought you were sleeping.

19:27.871 --> 19:29.652
And I thought the door was locked.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.053
What do you want?

19:32.088 --> 19:34.285
What's rightfully mine one half of this room.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.503
Oh, I thought you didn't giggle.

19:36.538 --> 19:38.405
That wasn't a giggle.
That was a

19:38.440 --> 19:39.790
"don't make me laugh".

19:40.355 --> 19:42.509
I've no idea why you don't like me.

19:42.550 --> 19:44.876
- You don't even know me.
- I know you.

19:44.901 --> 19:47.340
You were the top of your class in the high school,
had a cute boyfriend

19:47.356 --> 19:49.595
and actually enjoyed the extracurricular activities.

19:49.630 --> 19:53.537
Maybe. But I bet you can't handle which ones.

19:53.572 --> 19:57.266
Can, don't wanna.
Trust me, I know your type.

19:57.311 --> 20:00.755
- My type?
- Perfect, well-adjusted.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.794
You probably don't have a weird bone in your body.

20:02.829 --> 20:04.614
That's not true. I have many weird bones.

20:04.930 --> 20:07.253
Capitol double-joint thing going on.

20:10.071 --> 20:12.429
Wow, you're a freak!

20:12.464 --> 20:14.845
You don't know even half of it.
I haven't seen my mother

20:14.880 --> 20:16.230
in years, my father lives

20:16.241 --> 20:19.070
in the other realm, and as for well-adjusted,
well, I've got two aunts

20:19.105 --> 20:21.023
who are total witches.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.960
I see your ex and raise you

20:22.995 --> 20:24.815
my clinically drainaged stepmother.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.687
I double down my uncle...

20:26.722 --> 20:29.304
Look, I don't have to justify myself to you, Okay?

20:29.339 --> 20:31.304
Whether you think I'm weird or normal,

20:31.339 --> 20:33.600
it doesn't matter.
This room is half mine

20:33.635 --> 20:35.074
and I'm moving in.
Got it?

20:35.182 --> 20:38.702
Okay, you don't have to get nasty about it.

20:38.730 --> 20:40.623
I thought it would be a welcome change for "perky".

20:40.668 --> 20:43.810
As a start, I suppose you want me

20:43.835 --> 20:46.864
to help you with your bags?
- That'd be nice.

20:46.899 --> 20:48.511
I'll do it anyway.

20:48.546 --> 20:52.672
- Yes!
- We're in!

20:52.707 --> 20:55.200
- You go, girl!
- Thanks.

20:55.235 --> 20:56.585
You go too.

21:01.591 --> 21:02.966
We're really should get to sleep.

21:03.001 --> 21:04.902
If Sabrina calls, we'll hear the phone.

21:04.937 --> 21:07.048
She's nog gonna call.
After what we did

21:07.083 --> 21:08.443
she'll probably never talk to us

21:08.544 --> 21:10.455
again.
- I wouldn't say that.

21:10.490 --> 21:14.700
- Sabrina?
- I'm glad you gave that little push I needed.
I'm certain it worked things out with Roxie.

21:14.722 --> 21:16.182
Oh, that's great, honey.

21:16.225 --> 21:18.111
You know the only reason we drive you crazy

21:18.138 --> 21:19.992
is because we love you.

21:20.027 --> 21:23.232
I know. I love you guys, too.
Gotta go.

21:26.014 --> 21:28.255
Nice to see she's finally blending.

21:29.305 --> 21:35.469
