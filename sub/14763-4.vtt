05:03.404 --> 05:06.638

12:11.530 --> 12:13.698
[beeps]

12:13.700 --> 12:14.899
[grunts]

12:14.901 --> 12:17.001
[laughs]
Uh-oh.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.437
Going somewhere?
[whirring]

12:23.375 --> 12:25.643
[grunting]

12:28.114 --> 12:30.615
Gotcha!

12:36.756 --> 12:40.058
[radio beeps]
Baron, the Avengers are back!

12:40.060 --> 12:42.060
Ugh! So soon.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.696
Fixer, activate the last
of your protocols,

12:44.698 --> 12:46.464
and lock all exterior doors.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.571
[grunting]

12:53.573 --> 12:55.306
[beeping]

12:55.308 --> 12:57.308
My card's locked out?

12:57.310 --> 12:59.944
[Iron Man]
Nobody locks me out.
[beeping]

12:59.946 --> 13:01.446
Usually.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.481
Guys, we're gonna need
to use your keys.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.887
[thudding, clattering]
[both]
Huh?

13:08.889 --> 13:11.623
We're out of time.
Take as much as you can carry.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.726
Then we meet
back at the safe house.
Stop! Stop, all of you!

13:14.728 --> 13:16.327
You have nothing to fear.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.897
I will not allow you
to underestimate yourselves.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.965
You will not run.
<i>They</i> will run.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.968
You are the Masters of Evil.

13:23.970 --> 13:28.740
Remember, Zemo is always
several moves ahead.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.443
No Friday, no comm, no access.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.146
No way the Masters of Evil
could do all this.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.649
Whoever it was
left that note in the jungle.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.984
Masters of Evil or maybe Hydra.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.686
But Hawkeye stayed behind.

13:41.688 --> 13:45.423
If anyone compromised the Tower,
he would've stopped them.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.866
Yep. And it's a trap.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.177
[growls]

14:06.179 --> 14:07.912
[cries out]

14:11.951 --> 14:14.819
[grunts]
Our own training bots.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.055
<i>Except I've never seen them</i>
<i>move this fast.</i>

14:19.291 --> 14:22.393
They've gotten
some kind of upgrade.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.995
Stand fast, friends.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.397
I will free you.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.067
Wanna bet, blondie?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.135
[grunts]
[yells]

14:31.137 --> 14:32.804
[groans]

14:32.806 --> 14:34.806
[Goliath]
Whoa!

14:34.808 --> 14:38.042
Look what we can do
when we're inspired.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.011
[supersonic scream]

14:40.013 --> 14:41.546
[grunting]

14:43.682 --> 14:46.484
Aahh!

14:50.723 --> 14:53.157
[Fixer]
We've always been
a joke to you heroes,

14:53.159 --> 14:56.761
but you won't
be laughing now,
or ever again!

14:56.763 --> 14:59.097
[grunts]
[supersonic scream]

14:59.099 --> 15:02.166
[crying out]

15:03.869 --> 15:06.638
[grunts]
Off, you jackals!

15:07.706 --> 15:09.107
[grunts]

15:17.716 --> 15:18.950
Aahh!

15:20.419 --> 15:22.487
Huh.

15:25.524 --> 15:28.893
[grunting]

15:28.895 --> 15:30.595
Aahh!

15:30.597 --> 15:33.064
Having trouble
with these lightweights?

15:33.066 --> 15:36.367
The Masters of Evil
are no longer
mere lightweights.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.170
The jesters
have become warriors.
[sonic scream]

15:40.572 --> 15:44.609
[crying out]
What's the matter, Hulk?

15:44.611 --> 15:47.045
Can't handle
a few million volts?

15:47.047 --> 15:49.547
[continues crying out]

15:50.549 --> 15:52.016
[grunting]

15:53.619 --> 15:55.987
[grunting]

15:55.989 --> 15:57.655
[grunts]

16:17.309 --> 16:19.978
[panting]

16:19.980 --> 16:21.045
[grunts]

16:24.016 --> 16:26.184
[grunting]

16:26.186 --> 16:27.852
What is this?

16:27.854 --> 16:30.188
Just a little
plasma-core netting.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.623
I whipped it up
from the stuff I took
from your Tower.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.192
So thanks, chumps.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.193
Aah!

16:35.195 --> 16:36.260
[groans]

16:41.333 --> 16:42.667
[panting]

16:42.669 --> 16:44.702
[grunts]

16:47.439 --> 16:48.473
[grunts]

16:48.475 --> 16:50.008
[supersonic scream]

16:50.010 --> 16:51.776
[grunting]

16:51.778 --> 16:55.279
Since when did
the Masters of Evil
get so organized?

16:55.281 --> 16:58.416
[grunting]

17:00.552 --> 17:04.321
Going somewhere, Hawkeye?

17:04.324 --> 17:08.826
Yeah, but you don't wanna
come with. Boring.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.962
[grunting]

17:12.464 --> 17:15.333
Take that!

17:15.335 --> 17:19.237
[grunting]

17:19.239 --> 17:22.339
You still struggle,
despite your obvious
lack of power.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.742
It's not really
about power, Baron.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.345
It's more about confidence.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.480
[grunting]

17:31.183 --> 17:32.116
Not good.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.753
[grunting]

17:37.089 --> 17:39.090
[yells]

17:39.092 --> 17:41.259
[grunts]

17:41.261 --> 17:42.427
Ooh.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.562
[grunting]

17:47.933 --> 17:51.803
[both grunting]

17:53.772 --> 17:55.840
You can't win, Falcon.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.243
I got a long reach.
[laughing]

17:59.245 --> 18:02.346
Need a little help
on the 42nd floor, please!

18:03.415 --> 18:04.749
[roars]

18:04.751 --> 18:08.419
This is my kind of fight--
a beat down!

18:08.421 --> 18:11.456
[grunting]

18:13.425 --> 18:16.527
You can't stop me.
I'm Goliath!

18:16.529 --> 18:19.630
[growls]

18:21.867 --> 18:24.469
[groans, grunts]

18:24.471 --> 18:28.306
I built this while working
for you, Mr. Stark,

18:28.308 --> 18:30.441
and you thanked me
by firing me.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.277
Just 'cause I have
trouble with my temper?

18:33.279 --> 18:36.214
Yeah. Wonder where
I got that idea.

18:40.385 --> 18:42.553
Wha-- Aahh!

18:46.391 --> 18:51.295
And for the record,
I fired you for babbling
about my secrets.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.431
I see
you haven't changed.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.433
[grunts]

18:55.435 --> 18:58.302
[grunts]

18:58.304 --> 19:00.671
[laughing]

19:02.741 --> 19:06.310
Hate to do this to you,
but I have to scatter
your atoms.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.312
Hope you can
forgive me someday.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.347
No!

19:09.349 --> 19:11.916
[both grunt]

19:11.918 --> 19:14.485
[supersonic scream]
[grunts]

19:14.487 --> 19:16.854
Your shield ain't
gonna stop this!
[supersonic scream]

19:18.323 --> 19:19.423
[normal scream]

19:19.425 --> 19:21.492
[grunts]

19:21.494 --> 19:23.661
That's funny,
'cause it just did.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.597
[grunting]

19:29.768 --> 19:31.335
[groaning]

19:33.438 --> 19:35.439
[grunting]

19:35.441 --> 19:39.310
Without a weapon, you are
the Avengers' weakest link.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.811
Only fit to run and hide.

19:40.813 --> 19:44.348
Pop quiz, Baron.
What do you think
I keep in this room?

19:44.350 --> 19:45.449
[grunts]

19:46.552 --> 19:48.019
Take a guess.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.621
[grunts]

19:53.458 --> 19:55.359
Baron Zemo?

19:55.361 --> 19:58.629
[yells, groans]
Never expected
to see you alive.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.532
Or leading
a bunch of second-stringers
like the Masters of Evil.

20:01.534 --> 20:05.670
Hah. My blood screams
for vengeance upon you, Captain,

20:05.672 --> 20:07.638
but not now.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.607
Not today!

20:11.643 --> 20:14.078
And stay out!

20:16.715 --> 20:21.485
That atom-scrambling device
you pulled on me--
what was that thing anyway?

20:21.487 --> 20:22.653
Cartridge pen.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.423
It writes in blue,
red, and black.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.525
Should've known.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.694
Defense systems coming online.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.496
Friday.
<i>What hit me?</i>

20:32.498 --> 20:34.665
<i>It wasn't the end</i>
<i>of the world, was it?</i>

20:34.667 --> 20:36.834
I took an inventory
of your vault, Tony.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.537
The only missing item
was some kind of stabilizer.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.706
My vault has really
dangerous things in it,

20:41.708 --> 20:44.375
and all Zemo took
was my old Inversion Stabilizer?

20:44.377 --> 20:46.377
[Hulk]
What's this
stable thing do?

20:46.379 --> 20:48.713
Just something I cooked up
over lunch one day.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.716
It's supposed to fool facial
and voice recognition.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.584
Not even sure it works.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.587
If Zemo wants it,
then nothing good
can come of it.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.556
Zemo's coming back
for us.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.058
He's always several moves
ahead of everybody.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.594
[chuckles]
Yeah, including you.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.563
[sighs]
[muffled]
No!

21:05.565 --> 21:08.566
He can't build us up like this
and just leave!

21:08.568 --> 21:12.536
You wanna know the real
reason why I switched
to being a hero, Mimi?

21:12.538 --> 21:14.739
My side never runs out
on each other.

21:14.741 --> 21:17.008
Just think about it.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.445
So, you think
you reached her?

21:21.447 --> 21:23.648
Hey, we have to try, right?

21:23.650 --> 21:24.815
[scoffs]
What a mess.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.817
We'll never be able
to clean this place up.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.653
Well, we have to try, right?

21:28.655 --> 21:30.655
Oh, I see
what you did there.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.657
Mm-hmm.
