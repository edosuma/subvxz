WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.601
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...

00:02.603 --> 00:04.403
ELIZABETH:<i> Mary, Queen of Scots</i>
<i> will soon seek</i>

00:04.405 --> 00:05.738
<i> a marriage alliance.</i>
<i> Spain's Prince Don Carlos</i>

00:05.740 --> 00:09.141
would raise her
international standing.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.276
And how do you suggest
I gain Mary's trust?

00:11.278 --> 00:13.245
Make Mary fall in love with you.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.646
Are you England's
new ambassador?

00:14.648 --> 00:16.148
Gideon Blackburn,
at your service.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.182
We can't do this.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.184
Then tell me how to stop.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.588
We're back because
she is our queen.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.589
I think it's for the best
if we don't

00:23.591 --> 00:25.024
discuss Elizabeth anymore.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.158
DON CARLOS:
The device is for me.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.393
My partner need only to whip me.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.661
It may seem odd
to you, but to me,

00:29.663 --> 00:31.663
pain equals pleasure.
MARY:
<i> You've been a very bad man,</i>

00:31.665 --> 00:33.532
Prince Carlos.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.667
Now you must face
your punishment.

00:35.669 --> 00:36.668
(groans)

00:36.670 --> 00:38.470
(screams)

00:38.472 --> 00:40.572
<i> The damage to his brain</i>
<i> is too much.</i>

00:40.574 --> 00:41.540
He's been impaired.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.675
Spain will see your acceptance

00:43.677 --> 00:45.577
of his condition as a win.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.046
DUKE OF ALBA:
<i> To the crown prince of Spain</i>

00:47.048 --> 00:48.213
and his future bride,

00:48.215 --> 00:49.681
Her Majesty, Mary Stuart.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.252
(cheering)

01:00.094 --> 01:01.560
Your Majesty,

01:01.562 --> 01:03.796
a gift from my family's shop.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.664
It is so lovely.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.232
Thank you.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.467
WILLIAM: You're not
the first monarch to walk

01:08.469 --> 01:10.436
among the people,
but you're decidedly

01:10.438 --> 01:12.738
the best at it.
Well, the people should know
their queen.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.840
And love you, even
if the nobles don't.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.543
I'm commending your
performance and your plan.

01:17.545 --> 01:21.380
I'm glad to see your attention's
back on the job at hand,

01:21.382 --> 01:24.216
now that Dudley's
away from court.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.085
Is there any more
court business to discuss,

01:26.087 --> 01:27.820
or shall I be on my way?

01:27.822 --> 01:29.588
News from France.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.490
Mary of Scots' closest friend,
her lady Lola,

01:31.492 --> 01:33.092
has agreed to be your hostage

01:33.094 --> 01:34.460
in exchange
for her family's release.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.662
She's on a boat headed
for our shores.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.464
I'm very pleased she accepted
my invitation.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.499
Thank you, William,

01:40.501 --> 01:42.167
for always being so thorough.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.636
If it wasn't for you,
we may never have known

01:44.638 --> 01:46.839
we captured such highborn Scots
in the border skirmish.

01:46.841 --> 01:49.274
(cheering)

01:49.276 --> 01:50.843
DRIVER:
Hyah!

01:50.845 --> 01:52.578
(horses whinny)

01:52.580 --> 01:55.180
WOMAN:
Long live the queen!

01:56.817 --> 01:58.884
(retching)

02:14.768 --> 02:16.335
It's all right, Don Carlos.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.203
Remember, there is
a grain shortage in Scotland.

02:18.205 --> 02:20.672
My people are very hungry.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.609
If you sign this,
Spain will send more relief.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.210
Mary,

02:25.212 --> 02:27.546
are you...

02:27.548 --> 02:30.149
my friend?

02:31.252 --> 02:32.684
Of course I am.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.520
And soon,
I will be your wife.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.755
Now, we must help each other,
mustn't we?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.897
(footsteps approaching)

02:44.899 --> 02:46.565
NARCISSE:
Don Carlos,

02:46.567 --> 02:48.233
our favorite prince.

02:48.235 --> 02:50.903
If I may add this
to the agenda?

02:50.905 --> 02:53.338
The prince requires a reader.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.408
This is promising Spanish gold

02:56.410 --> 02:58.377
to France<i> and</i> the regent.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.412
Call it a bonus.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.614
This marriage of yours
was sanctioned

03:02.616 --> 03:04.216
and arranged on French soil.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.385
What happens in France
should benefit France.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.889
I am trying to save

03:10.891 --> 03:13.325
my starving countrymen.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.460
You are using the prince
as your own personal bank

03:15.462 --> 03:17.296
while France is in debt
to her soldiers

03:17.298 --> 03:18.964
who fought on Scotland's behalf.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.800
Those Frenchmen will be
returning within a fortnight.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.603
How am I supposed to pay them
for their sacrifice?

03:25.673 --> 03:27.573
It feels immoral

03:27.575 --> 03:28.907
to feed off the prince's...

03:30.611 --> 03:32.244
...generosity.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.879
You will be feeding
off his generosity

03:33.881 --> 03:35.981
for the rest of your life
once you marry,

03:35.983 --> 03:37.849
but I only have the
prince in France

03:37.851 --> 03:39.284
for a short while,

03:39.286 --> 03:40.686
and I intend

03:40.688 --> 03:42.521
to enjoy the feast.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.657
Don Carlos.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.359
Just there.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.536
(sighs)

04:02.943 --> 04:05.010
(door opens)

04:09.483 --> 04:11.550
(sighs)
Ambassador Blackburn.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.585
Your Highness.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.753
Call me Gideon, please.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.288
Did I startle you?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.456
Just a little.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.757
My apologies.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.360
I imagine when you
were queen of France,

04:21.362 --> 04:22.728
you had a private balcony
all to yourself.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.330
No such surprises
as another restless soul.

04:25.332 --> 04:28.900
You'll be back to a life of
luxury and privacy soon enough,

04:28.902 --> 04:30.902
once you wed the
prince of Spain.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.038
Will I be invited
to the lavish celebration?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.373
There won't be any.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.308
It would be in poor taste,

04:36.310 --> 04:38.644
as I am recently a widow.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.045
Is it your conscience

04:40.047 --> 04:41.780
that's brought you
out here tonight?

04:41.782 --> 04:46.518
Knowing you're marrying
a compromised prince?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.787
I'm told Don Carlos can't
remember the accident,

04:48.789 --> 04:51.356
but since his fall,
he rarely talks.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.392
Half his body seems damaged.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.926
I have cared
for an ailing husband before.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.895
I will care for Don Carlos
just the same.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.063
Well, you loved King Francis.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.998
This marriage is mercenary
at best.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.402
You know nothing of Francis
or my heart.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.704
I need Spain.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.406
I have a country to protect,

05:07.408 --> 05:09.474
and I have lost more
than you could fathom.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.813
Oh, I know loss, Mary.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.548
I was married once,

05:16.550 --> 05:18.750
to girl I loved so deeply.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.018
She died in childbirth.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.753
I'm sorry.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.955
Love like that
can be a curse,

05:23.957 --> 05:25.824
not just because one grieves,

05:25.826 --> 05:27.726
but because it will be hard
to love again,

05:27.728 --> 05:29.861
to settle for anything less.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.097
And the man you will marry
offers far less.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.633
Spain is the most powerful
nation in the world.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.568
And with Scotland tilting
to the Protestants

05:36.570 --> 05:38.337
more and more each day,

05:38.339 --> 05:41.106
I cannot return home
without Catholic protection.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.841
And what does Spain offer you
as a woman?

05:42.843 --> 05:44.976
Are you really prepared

05:44.978 --> 05:46.445
to spend the rest of your life
with someone

05:46.447 --> 05:47.579
you know you will never love?

05:47.581 --> 05:50.115
You are turning the conversation

05:50.117 --> 05:51.983
because you are Elizabeth's spy.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.453
You want to manipulate me
into calling off the wedding,

05:54.455 --> 05:56.855
destroying the alliance
with Spain.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.057
You probably never
even had a wife.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.760
It's just another lie you tell.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.628
I never said I
was a good man,

06:03.630 --> 06:06.098
but one can receive good advice
from a bad person.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.633
And I promise,
you marry that prince,

06:08.635 --> 06:10.068
you'll regret it forever.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.940
¶ ¶

06:14.942 --> 06:16.908
We won't be disturbed here.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.777
No one visits this room
except the servants,

06:18.779 --> 06:20.612
and I've claimed it
for the hour.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.383
A whole hour, you say?

06:24.385 --> 06:27.018
I think we're safer
in my chambers.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.859
I thought you might like
a change of venue.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.594
You've been tense

06:35.596 --> 06:38.463
ever since Lord Narcisse
became regent.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.732
I have something different

06:40.734 --> 06:42.901
to take your mind
off your aggravations.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.170
(chuckles)

06:46.540 --> 06:47.939
The servants tell me
it belonged

06:47.941 --> 06:49.708
to Prince Don Carlos.

06:49.710 --> 06:53.478
It was found in his room
after some sort of accident.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.148
It would be kindling in a fire,
had I not retrieved it.

06:56.150 --> 06:58.683
Why do you want to
use that thing?

06:58.685 --> 07:00.919
To keep things
interesting.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.788
I can tie you to it.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.090
Christophe, a man nearly died
on that device.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.759
I'm not comfortable using it
in our sex play.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.960
(gasps)

07:08.962 --> 07:10.962
There is still blood on it.
Look.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.564
I'll fetch a rag.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.665
Do you not hear me?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.000
I said a man nearly died.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.636
You're right.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.504
That is sad.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.206
Why don't we go back
to our usual game?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.541
No.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.009
I'm no longer in the mood.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.679
(sighs)

07:27.681 --> 07:29.047
After the wedding,

07:29.049 --> 07:30.816
the prince and I will travel
to Spain.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.851
(door opens)
And will there be
a wedding tour?

07:32.853 --> 07:34.586
I thought it might be...
Please, excuse my interruption,

07:34.588 --> 07:37.088
but I have an urgent message
from England.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.824
For Spain.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.959
Queen Elizabeth has reconsidered
Don Carlos as a husband.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.663
A formal marriage proposal
will arrive in two days' time.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.964
Well, that's outrageous.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.699
Queen Elizabeth
personally rejected

07:47.701 --> 07:49.100
Don Carlos months ago.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.535
That was then.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.237
The prince's current condition

07:52.239 --> 07:54.473
has changed her perspective.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.875
In many ways, he's become
the ideal husband for her.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.710
Impaired,

07:58.712 --> 08:00.846
but a more gentle spirit,
who'll make a gentle king.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.981
Unbelievable.
DUKE OF ALBA:
The prince's fall

08:02.983 --> 08:04.583
was common knowledge.

08:04.585 --> 08:05.817
However, his mental state...
Is best kept quiet.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.985
Yes, I agree.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.653
Appearances matter.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.222
And England will ensure
the world never learns

08:10.224 --> 08:12.624
of his challenges.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.226
Give us a moment.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.631
Out of respect
for our English neighbors,

08:19.633 --> 08:21.533
we move to delay
the marriage

08:21.535 --> 08:22.834
between Don Carlos
and Queen Mary

08:22.836 --> 08:24.503
until Queen Elizabeth's
offer arrives.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.937
You're considering her offer?

08:25.939 --> 08:27.272
Yes, we must.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.676
It's a marvelous
bluff, Gideon.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.645
Well, it's barely a bluff,
with little risk.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.681
If Elizabeth rejects the idea,
I'll say she changed her mind

08:36.683 --> 08:38.583
and blame
her mercurial nature.

08:38.585 --> 08:39.951
At least I've delayed
the wedding

08:39.953 --> 08:41.620
until we can formulate
another plan of attack.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.722
Or this docile prince

08:43.724 --> 08:46.758
might just be the king our
Elizabeth's been waiting for.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.860
(bell tolling)

08:51.064 --> 08:52.230
(knocking)

08:52.232 --> 08:53.632
(door opens)

08:56.270 --> 08:58.837
I left Cornwall as soon
as I got your letter.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.573
Is everything all right?

09:01.575 --> 09:03.141
You said there was
an emergency.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.777
I'm pregnant.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.646
With your child.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.980
Are you certain?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.315
I'm quite late,
I'm queasy.

09:10.317 --> 09:14.152
The sickness only confirming
what I feared.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.887
Which can't be.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.657
You're an unmarried queen.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.125
A pregnancy would ruin me.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.760
Could you?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.662
End the pregnancy?

09:23.664 --> 09:26.932
Such a procedure is
dangerous in many ways.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.600
I'm a sovereign queen.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.902
I cannot put my life
and my country

09:30.904 --> 09:32.604
at such risk.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.676
We must marry.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.611
I am married, Elizabeth.
Then get a divorce.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.046
We've talked about this option
so many times.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.814
It's almost impossible.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.817
I could push it
through parliament

09:45.819 --> 09:47.218
with all my might.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.887
And they would know your actions
were self-serving,

09:48.889 --> 09:50.822
especially once we married
immediately after.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.892
We would be judged
and scorned.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.794
Half of England
doesn't even recognize divorce.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.062
Even if we were to wed,

09:57.064 --> 09:59.164
our child would be
considered illegitimate.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.232
As many consider me,

10:01.234 --> 10:02.834
and yet I am queen.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.036
I would be abandoning
a dying wife.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.705
Is Amy dying?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.707
You left to aid in her recovery.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.809
She's weak and frail
with no sign of improvement.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.243
If only we could wait.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.713
Elizabeth.
Then what is your solution,

10:14.715 --> 10:15.981
Robert?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.215
I am pregnant.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.750
We did this together.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.253
You could marry another.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.855
There isn't time.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.358
Is that what you want?

10:26.360 --> 10:27.325
No.

10:28.662 --> 10:31.129
You are the man I love,

10:31.131 --> 10:33.331
and this is our child.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.333
There has to be some way.

10:35.335 --> 10:39.004
All I ever hear is that England
needs a king and an heir.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.806
And I can give them both.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.078
I will marry you.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.816
I'll divorce my wife,
and I'll marry you.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.754
And I will pray for our souls.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.690
And for our child's.

10:58.692 --> 11:03.428
Because if England, your nobles
and your people, see this babe

11:03.430 --> 11:07.932
not as a blessing but
as evidence of my ambition

11:07.934 --> 11:09.934
and of your wickedness...

11:09.936 --> 11:11.870
It will be the end of us all.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.346
You're planning to marry him,
and now he's going to divorce?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.348
How can you possibly think
this is a good idea?

11:23.350 --> 11:24.949
'Cause I love him.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.685
And he loves me.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.687
Does he care about
your future as a queen?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.689
Does he consider how this
will look to your subjects?

11:30.691 --> 11:32.691
Many of your people are
vehemently opposed to divorce.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.693
They'll have
to get used to it.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.061
This is my choice.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.062
It's a rash decision.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.363
And what's the hurry?

11:38.365 --> 11:41.232
You said yourself his
wife is gravely ill.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.267
She might die.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.334
Why not wait and see?

11:43.336 --> 11:45.336
I can't.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.471
I won't.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.006
I hear things,
you know.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.008
People whisper
about Robert and me.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.476
Wouldn't it
be better

11:51.478 --> 11:54.345
if we married and started
down the honorable path

11:54.347 --> 11:55.947
sooner rather than later?

11:55.949 --> 11:58.349
If you love
your queen, William,

11:58.351 --> 11:59.851
you will support me.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.419
Help you steal a husband?

12:01.421 --> 12:05.156
The people will call you
temptress, harlot or worse.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.858
You're creating
a terrible mess, Elizabeth.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.860
Then clean it up.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.328
That is your job.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.131
And my decision is final.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.335
MAN: I am humbly aware
of the many Frenchmen

12:17.337 --> 12:19.137
vying to court you,
Princess Claude,

12:19.139 --> 12:22.741
but I would be so honored
if you might accept... this.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.409
(yawns)

12:24.411 --> 12:26.411
Oh, my apologies.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.946
It's lovely.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.114
Thank you.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.815
Might I?

12:30.817 --> 12:33.284
My dear mother wore it
upon her bosom.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.987
She was a, uh, larger woman.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.358
Princess Claude.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.428
Excuse me, you have
a Latin lesson to attend.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.429
Latin!

12:44.431 --> 12:45.864
Is that today?

12:45.866 --> 12:49.200
Well, this is a terrible
inconvenience.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.402
I was having such
a wonderful time with...

12:51.404 --> 12:53.037
Archduke Forlay.
Yes, of course.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.373
I'm very displeased by this.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.276
Thank you for the gift.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.012
I shall think of your mother
whenever I wear it.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.554
I do so love my Latin lessons.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.123
I always told myself that
if I had a daughter or a wife,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.559
I'd teach them how to defend
themselves. Yes, all right.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.128
So if a man comes at you,
hit him in the throat.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.563
You take away his breath, and
he'll go right to his knees.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.132
You just have to put
your whole body into it.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.403
Claude, I want
you to be safe.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.406
Even when I'm not here
to protect you.
Are you going somewhere?

13:28.408 --> 13:29.908
You said yourself,
we're never getting married,

13:29.910 --> 13:32.577
so one day we'll both
have to move on.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.579
But until then,

13:34.581 --> 13:37.916
I got the, uh, precautions.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.151
I went to the village
this morning.

13:42.556 --> 13:46.591
Wait, where exactly
did you get them?

13:46.593 --> 13:48.359
I went to the merchant
you specified,

13:48.361 --> 13:50.361
and I asked for sheepskin,
as you specified.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.231
I never said sheepskin.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.201
All right,
no matter.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.069
Claude, are you nervous?
We don't have to have sex.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.604
Why would I be nervous?
I don't know.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.306
It isn't exactly the first time
for either of us.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.841
What does<i> that</i> mean?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.375
Have you honestly forgotten?
I delivered you

14:04.377 --> 14:06.211
to a baron and had to wait
outside the room while...

14:06.213 --> 14:09.113
You think that because I'm not
a virgin I'll sleep with anyone?

14:09.115 --> 14:11.482
Now I'm "anyone" because
I'm not a baron or a duke?

14:11.484 --> 14:12.584
You just don't understand.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.619
I'm a princess.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.989
I can't just throw my fate
to the wind for someone...

14:17.991 --> 14:19.057
Beneath you?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.963
I didn't make up the rules.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.332
(clears throat)

14:35.342 --> 14:37.342
Delphine.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.244
Have you been outside today?

14:39.246 --> 14:40.979
I don't think I'm ready.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.016
You haven't left
this room in days.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.254
Not that I mind having
someone to come home to.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.122
But I'm worried about you.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.458
I know you're scared, ever since
the night in Greer's tavern,

14:53.460 --> 14:55.059
when you were in the same
room with the killer,

14:55.061 --> 14:56.361
but you're safe now.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.296
(knocking on door)

14:58.298 --> 15:00.431
Sir, an unsigned letter
just arrived.

15:02.002 --> 15:05.003
It concerns the murders.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.537
(door closes)

15:06.539 --> 15:09.007
"To the king's deputy
and his healer.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.542
"By the time you read this,
I will be long gone,

15:11.544 --> 15:13.378
"but you should know
the healer's touch changed me.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.681
"The desire to kill left me
for the first time in my life.

15:16.683 --> 15:20.285
I will claim no more hearts,
and may God forgive my sins."

15:20.287 --> 15:22.353
Does he think this will slow
my search, stop it?

15:22.355 --> 15:24.422
I'm sure that's
his hope.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.291
But, Bash, it is possible
that he is healed.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.425
He spared me
that night.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.093
After he touched me.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.096
I felt his urges transfer to me.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.098
And there have been
no murders since.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.700
No. He knows we're close.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.403
This message is a desperate bid
to throw us off.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.005
The sickness that drives
this man cannot be stopped.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.073
We must continue our search.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.042
Delphine,

15:44.044 --> 15:45.243
what are you so afraid of?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.011
You know I will protect you.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.681
Come with me to the village--
we'll retrace your steps.

15:49.683 --> 15:52.183
Maybe reawaken your abilities.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.253
I can't do this without you.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.691
(music playing)
(laughing)

15:59.693 --> 16:02.060
(indistinct conversations)

16:04.331 --> 16:06.097
I don't trust anyone
from Elizabeth's court.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.199
Least of all
her new ambassador.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.134
Can you intercept
Gideon's correspondence?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.070
What am I looking for?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.472
I wonder if this
marriage proposal

16:14.474 --> 16:16.341
from Elizabeth
is even real.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.377
It could just be a fabrication
meant to delay the wedding,

16:19.379 --> 16:21.479
disrupt the alliance.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.615
If it's false, you'll need
to prove it to Spain.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.417
I'll see what I can find.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.087
Can you imagine, Greer?
I'm going to marry him.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.289
After all that's happened
I'm going to be his wife.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.692
I had real love
in my marriage with Francis.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.663
I do wonder
if I can live without it.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.531
And watch closely.
The trick of the game

16:40.533 --> 16:41.632
is to strike the top

16:41.634 --> 16:43.701
and keep it spinning.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.579
(grunts)

17:01.287 --> 17:02.620
Ten.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.655
Don Carlos, are you all right?

17:04.657 --> 17:07.392
Very... tired.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.461
Can I l-lie down?

17:10.463 --> 17:12.196
Of course.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.242
Did the prince enjoy the games
in the courtyard?

17:24.244 --> 17:28.212
Why are you talking to me
as if I'm a child?

17:28.214 --> 17:30.581
Your speech.
Have you recovered? I should get

17:30.583 --> 17:32.083
the physicians
and tell the Scottish queen.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.453
No. For the last few days

17:35.455 --> 17:38.656
I've been feeling
my senses... return.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.692
Words, phrases, my arm.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.661
But I hid it.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.797
Somehow I knew
I wasn't safe here.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.732
I didn't know why
until today.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.700
I remembered
my accident.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.469
Mary was there.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.337
She deceived me.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.739
Betrayed my trust.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.308
Because of her
I nearly lost everything.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.078
What do you want me to do
about Mary?
You?

18:00.080 --> 18:01.846
I've been listening
to you, too, Federico.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.581
Mocking my secrets.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.184
Even as a prince, I have to hide
my desires from the world.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.752
Why, when I can
live as I please?

18:07.754 --> 18:10.755
Be who I am.
There is a way. Finally.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.091
Mary's been using me.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.359
And now I'm going to use her.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.230
It's time I did as
I liked in a country

18:19.232 --> 18:22.233
of my own.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.836
I think I'll take Scotland.

18:30.343 --> 18:33.244
Spain is willing to reject Queen
Elizabeth's offer of marriage.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.379
if Queen Mary
agrees to grant

18:35.381 --> 18:37.181
her husband the
Crown Matrimonial.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.653
That is a very
large request.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.356
If I were to die childless,
the Crown Matrimonial

18:45.358 --> 18:48.893
guarantees that Don Carlos
remains king of Scotland.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.528
CATHERINE:
Where is this coming from?

18:50.530 --> 18:52.497
This seems rather
uncharacteristic

18:52.499 --> 18:54.265
for the gentle prince.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.235
From his father,
King Philip of Spain.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.470
He makes the request most
respectfully, as Spain

18:59.472 --> 19:01.472
is offering you
so much in return.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.274
We will retire
and await your response.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.643
This way,
Your Highness.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.417
It's not ideal,
but any man

19:13.419 --> 19:15.353
of royal lineage
would seek the same

19:15.355 --> 19:17.855
to guarantee himself a crown.
It's still a risk,

19:17.857 --> 19:21.292
for any queen--
naming a man as my successor.
Well, consider

19:21.294 --> 19:23.461
the man you're dealing with.
It's very unlikely

19:23.463 --> 19:25.596
he'll exercise any power at all.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.199
His brain is damaged.
But if you want him,

19:28.201 --> 19:30.334
you will have to edge out
Elizabeth.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.472
(laughing, music playing)

19:34.474 --> 19:36.207
(indistinct conversations)

19:36.209 --> 19:39.644
Excuse me.

19:39.646 --> 19:43.381
Is there a reason
you've been staring at me?

19:43.383 --> 19:45.783
Just admiring your technique.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.186
Men seem to fall at your feet.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.421
If you mean the men here, I'm
simply arranging transactions

19:50.423 --> 19:52.957
for my courtesans.
Besides, I'm still married--

19:52.959 --> 19:54.425
I'm no real option for anyone.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.828
Might your sudden
interest in me

19:57.830 --> 20:00.298
have anything to do
with Leith, perhaps?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.899
Claude,
you needn't worry,

20:01.901 --> 20:03.668
there's nothing
between us anymore.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.570
But he did love you.

20:05.572 --> 20:08.639
You were his great
love, after all.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.508
His forever love.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.611
No such love exists unless
we make it so, and we did not.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.946
Last time I spoke
to Leith, he seemed

20:14.948 --> 20:17.348
quite smitten with you.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.550
Well, he hates me now.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.852
It all seemed to
be going well.

20:21.854 --> 20:25.256
And we were about to...

20:25.258 --> 20:26.757
you know.
I do know.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.759
Easy on the wine.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.362
But I just felt angry
all of a sudden.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.598
Like I needed to
protect myself.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.266
Well, if you're
protecting yourself,

20:35.268 --> 20:36.701
it sounds like
you're afraid of something.

20:36.703 --> 20:37.969
Of course
I'm afraid.

20:37.971 --> 20:40.304
I convinced
him it could be casual,

20:40.306 --> 20:42.873
that I wouldn't break his heart
like you did.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.710
But what about my heart?

20:45.712 --> 20:47.011
You're falling in love with him

20:47.013 --> 20:49.780
and you're afraid
it will end.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.816
Claude,
I recently had a dalliance

20:51.818 --> 20:53.751
with a man that I didn't
love at all

20:53.753 --> 20:55.686
and I told myself
that I was risking less,

20:55.688 --> 20:57.321
but I was wrong.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.956
There is always risk.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.858
At least when
you love someone,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.693
it's worth taking.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.698
(indistinct chatter)

21:07.700 --> 21:10.434
Are you all right?
Do you feel anything?

21:10.436 --> 21:12.370
(horse neighs)

21:12.372 --> 21:15.573
(overlapping whispering voices)

21:21.347 --> 21:23.714
(panting)

21:23.716 --> 21:26.384
What is it? Do you
sense the killer?

21:26.386 --> 21:28.486
It's not the killer.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.321
Though I still feel his rage.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.056
I hoped it was
only temporary,

21:32.058 --> 21:34.725
but it's been with me since
the night at Greer's Tavern.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.795
The people passing
in the street,

21:37.797 --> 21:39.463
I want to hurt them.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.931
Is this why
you haven't left my chambers?

21:40.933 --> 21:42.400
Maybe what the killer wrote
is true.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.402
Maybe he really is healed

21:44.404 --> 21:47.471
and the hatred he carried
has been transferred into me.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.041
I'm sorry.

21:50.043 --> 21:53.044
I've pushed you too hard.

21:53.046 --> 21:56.781
There's another path back to the
castle, away from these crowds.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.516
I'll get you there safely.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.985
And you will heal. I promise.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.962
Gentlemen.
Majesty.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.731
After much thought,
I have decided to grant

22:13.733 --> 22:15.966
Don Carlos
the Crown Matrimonial,

22:15.968 --> 22:18.436
under one condition:
that the wedding take place

22:18.438 --> 22:19.737
tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

22:19.739 --> 22:22.006
Before Elizabeth's
counterproposal arrives.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.641
I won't make my offer again.

22:25.745 --> 22:26.644
(murmuring)

22:29.882 --> 22:31.115
Queen Mary,
we accept

22:31.117 --> 22:32.850
your offer on behalf
of the prince.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.051
Tomorrow you
will be wed

22:34.053 --> 22:36.454
and begin your lives
as husband and wife.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.664
(birds calling)

22:49.068 --> 22:51.135
Amy.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.773
Why aren't you in Cornwall?

22:55.775 --> 22:58.142
Elizabeth called you back
to court.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.511
Did you think
I would ignore that?

23:00.513 --> 23:02.913
So what is it now?

23:02.915 --> 23:07.918
Am I faltering in our queen's
post as Keeper of the Swans?

23:07.920 --> 23:09.787
Given the fact I
can barely stand.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.789
I'm seeking a divorce.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.491
Now?

23:13.493 --> 23:14.558
I'm dying, Robert.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.559
Elizabeth and I
love each other.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.894
We're going to marry.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.162
I'll continue to provide you
with the best care

23:18.164 --> 23:20.097
and the finest treatment.
You know you can run

23:20.099 --> 23:21.999
to Elizabeth as soon
as I'm dead. Why can't you wait?

23:22.001 --> 23:23.834
We can't wait. We won't.

23:23.836 --> 23:24.702
Why?

23:27.907 --> 23:28.506
Why?

23:28.507 --> 23:29.106
That emergency
in Elizabeth's message,

23:29.108 --> 23:30.674
what was it? What
makes you want

23:30.676 --> 23:31.876
to rush to the altar so quickly?

23:31.878 --> 23:32.910
To divorce me now?

23:32.912 --> 23:34.512
(sighs)

23:35.548 --> 23:38.883
She's pregnant, isn't she?

23:38.885 --> 23:41.085
Don't be ridiculous.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.087
Go on. Deny it.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.123
But this child you think
will determine your fate,
bind your love,

23:46.125 --> 23:48.793
will ruin you. And you
will never leave me.
I'm warning you. Don't do this.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.162
If you try to divorce me,
I will tell the world that
Elizabeth is with child.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.464
She will lose her throne.
I bet they'll find a way

23:53.466 --> 23:55.533
to take her head.
Just like her mother.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.768
If you try, I will kill you
myself. I swear.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.470
(gasping)

24:00.640 --> 24:02.706
Wh-What are you doing?

24:02.708 --> 24:04.809
I'm locking you up.
I'll dismiss the servants.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.678
You'll have an audience
with no one until I return.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.714
I won't be condemned
to a life of shame!
No, you'll live out your days

24:10.716 --> 24:12.583
in comfort. I'll send you
far away, but you'll want

24:12.585 --> 24:14.218
for nothing.
I won't be locked
away again!

24:14.220 --> 24:17.087
My parents used to lock me up!
I won't let you hide me!

24:17.089 --> 24:18.689
Stop it now!

24:18.691 --> 24:20.658
(shouts, panting)

24:20.660 --> 24:22.927
I won't be locked away
like a crazed animal

24:22.929 --> 24:24.995
when I'm not crazy! I'm not!

24:24.997 --> 24:27.998
Elizabeth will never have you! I
swear, she will never have you!

24:28.000 --> 24:29.467
Ever!

24:34.707 --> 24:36.540
Are you sure
Don Carlos moved his bad arm?

24:36.542 --> 24:38.709
It happened so fast.
But perhaps I'm wrong.

24:38.711 --> 24:41.712
But I can't stop thinking...

24:41.714 --> 24:44.582
Could he be pretending

24:44.584 --> 24:47.251
to be in worse condition
than he is?

24:47.253 --> 24:48.853
Why would he hide his recovery?

24:48.855 --> 24:51.489
You wanted to marry him
before his accident.

24:51.491 --> 24:52.690
Mary, it's normal
for a bride

24:52.692 --> 24:54.492
to get cold feet
before her wedding.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.693
Is that what's happening to me?

24:55.695 --> 24:59.163
I feel so far from normal.

24:59.165 --> 25:04.502
I am a queen about to marry
a broken prince for power.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.036
You're also a widow

25:06.038 --> 25:08.639
grieving the man
you truly loved.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.809
Mary, if you're
looking for an excuse

25:11.811 --> 25:14.678
not to go through with
the wedding, as a Scot,

25:14.680 --> 25:17.047
it's hard for me
to offer one.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.183
The Spanish alliance
would empower you

25:19.185 --> 25:21.118
and our nation
against Elizabeth.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.588
Spain would allow you to bring
Lola and her family home alive.

25:24.590 --> 25:27.625
All you have to do
is walk down that aisle.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.263
It'll be fun.

25:32.265 --> 25:34.765
If the royals use it
to entertain themselves,

25:34.767 --> 25:38.168
then why
shouldn't we?
(chuckles)

25:38.170 --> 25:39.169
(gasps)

25:39.171 --> 25:41.071
Excuse me, Queen Mother.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.239
I...

25:42.241 --> 25:43.541
wandered in by accident.

25:43.543 --> 25:44.708
Of course you did.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.079
You're still at it.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.848
The girl wanted
to try it.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.116
Why are you here?

25:52.118 --> 25:54.151
I had you followed.
I am the queen mother.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.186
I need to be careful
who I draw close,

25:56.188 --> 25:57.855
to see if you can be trusted.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.790
To do what? Service only you?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.592
Is that what you're asking?
No, it
really isn't.

26:01.594 --> 26:03.060
But I must admit
that seeing you

26:03.062 --> 26:05.930
with someone your own age,
it does make me wonder:

26:05.932 --> 26:08.933
what do you hope to gain
from being my lover?

26:08.935 --> 26:10.935
And be honest
this time.

26:10.937 --> 26:14.338
Well, I won't lie to you.
Poverty takes its toll.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.807
Mmm. So it's money
that you want.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.209
I want to earn it. And I don't
want to tend fireplaces

26:19.211 --> 26:20.778
for the rest of my life.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.047
I'll get you a job
with the stable master.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.082
I slept with his daughter.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.951
How 'bout a position
in the kitchen?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.786
The baker's wife.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.655
Really, Christophe,
is there anywhere in the castle

26:31.657 --> 26:33.891
you have not spilled your seed?
I...

26:33.893 --> 26:36.026
What about the kingsguard?

26:36.028 --> 26:39.363
There's good coin in that,
and the job demands respect.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.899
I've no combat experience, but
I'm a quick study.

26:41.901 --> 26:45.169
I bet you are. I like that we
understand each other better.

26:45.171 --> 26:49.039
And I suppose, if I'm
gonna take the regency,

26:49.041 --> 26:52.910
it would help me to have
someone loyal in the kingsguard.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.345
I am loyal to you.

26:54.347 --> 26:57.047
Let me show you.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.383
Not here.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.318
My chambers.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.824
(insects trilling)

27:08.761 --> 27:12.129
Queen Mary, you sent for me?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.664
Yes.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.399
I need some good advice
from a bad person.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.267
I'm concerned
the Spanish prince

27:17.269 --> 27:19.003
is lying to me
about his condition,

27:19.005 --> 27:20.804
that he's recovered more
than he's letting on.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.673
Why would he do that?
I don't know.

27:22.675 --> 27:23.874
But if he's deceiving me,

27:23.876 --> 27:25.275
he's also deceiving your queen

27:25.277 --> 27:27.678
and is therefore unsuitable
for both of us.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.013
Certainly you haven't come to me
out of concern

27:29.015 --> 27:30.648
for your English cousin.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.816
I came to you because
everyone in this castle

27:32.818 --> 27:36.353
wants me to go forward with
this marriage, except you.

27:36.355 --> 27:37.955
I know you want to stop
this alliance at any cost,

27:37.957 --> 27:39.156
so I'm giving you

27:39.158 --> 27:41.659
a chance to find the truth
for me.

27:41.661 --> 27:45.062
If Don Carlos is lying, then
he must have an ulterior motive.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.231
I need proof
before the wedding happens.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.932
That's tomorrow.
Yes.

27:48.934 --> 27:51.435
So you'd better get to it then.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.107
She threatened
to expose my pregnancy?

27:57.109 --> 28:01.111
I will send Amy to the Tower
and have her hanged for treason.

28:01.113 --> 28:04.081
You can't have Amy hanged.
She threatened a queen.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.949
If Amy is killed and you look
responsible in any way,

28:05.951 --> 28:07.718
then we can never be together.
Then what

28:07.720 --> 28:09.753
do you suggest we do?
I think I
know a way.

28:09.755 --> 28:12.056
I believe
that Amy is truly insane.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.924
Finally you see her
for what she really is.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.893
They locked her away
when she was young.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.861
She can be put away again.
In an asylum.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.396
Then she'll be
declared mentally unfit,

28:19.398 --> 28:20.798
I'll be granted
my divorce,

28:20.800 --> 28:22.700
and you and I can wed.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.436
The only part of this

28:25.438 --> 28:27.938
that I feel good about
is being with you.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.807
I know.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.777
I love you.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.715
AMY:
You loved me. You lied.

28:37.717 --> 28:40.751
You can't do this to me.
You won't.

28:44.423 --> 28:47.324
(panting)

28:56.969 --> 28:58.502
(grunting)
(clanging)

29:00.506 --> 29:03.440
Rot in hell,
you and your virgin queen!

29:07.379 --> 29:09.146
(thud)

29:19.892 --> 29:22.292
What is it?

29:22.294 --> 29:24.762
Amy Dudley
is dead.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.997
A servant at the Dudley's
country house found her body

29:26.999 --> 29:28.999
this morning. She was
at the bottom of the stairs

29:29.001 --> 29:30.300
with a broken neck.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.369
How?
There are signs of a struggle.

29:32.371 --> 29:35.272
The Dudleys were heard
arguing that same day,
before Robert dismissed

29:35.274 --> 29:38.008
all of the servants. And now
rumors are already spreading

29:38.010 --> 29:39.977
that Dudley murdered his wife.

29:39.979 --> 29:43.147
He didn't do this, William.
He couldn't have done this.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.149
How can you be sure?
I am.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.851
Stay away from him.
None of this will matter
once he's absolved.

29:47.853 --> 29:52.055
The scandal will recede,
and we will be married.
You and Dudley will never marry.

29:52.057 --> 29:54.324
He might hang
as a murderer. Do you want
to be accused as well?

29:54.326 --> 29:56.326
Your affair is motive,
Elizabeth.

29:56.328 --> 29:59.196
You need to save yourself,
or you could lose your kingdom.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.931
And your life.

30:09.875 --> 30:11.408
You're leaving?

30:11.410 --> 30:13.911
There's news of an avalanche
in the mountains.

30:13.913 --> 30:16.446
Many died,
even more were injured.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.583
The survivors will need help.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.451
Who's going to help you?

30:21.453 --> 30:24.021
If I start healing others again,

30:24.023 --> 30:27.024
maybe I'll heal myself.

30:27.026 --> 30:30.227
I was never meant to chase
a monster. Besides,

30:30.229 --> 30:33.197
he's probably far away by now.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.965
Bash, I have to leave.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.333
I'm a danger here,

30:36.335 --> 30:37.534
even to you.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.938
I won't try to stop
you this time,

30:40.940 --> 30:42.940
but I will wait for you.
I want you to know

30:42.942 --> 30:45.509
you'll always have someone
to come home to.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.050
Do you like it, Princess?
It's quite

30:53.052 --> 30:55.485
something.
Yes. I stuffed it
myself.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.988
Notice the plumage.
Leith!

30:57.990 --> 31:00.858
Princess.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.926
Leith,
don't I have

31:02.928 --> 31:04.394
a Latin lesson today?

31:04.396 --> 31:07.631
No. Not today.
You're mistaken.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.968
I'm quite sure...
I'm quite sure

31:10.970 --> 31:14.938
that you tired of Latin.
You found it... beneath you.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.975
Leith! I've had quite a bit of
time to think, and I didn't mean

31:17.977 --> 31:19.576
what I said about Latin.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.246
It's not in any way beneath me.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.547
In fact,

31:23.549 --> 31:25.148
I adore Latin.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.350
Then why would you say
all those things?

31:26.352 --> 31:27.584
Because it's
frightening,

31:27.586 --> 31:31.321
the idea of devoting myself
to Latin

31:31.323 --> 31:32.956
when I might
possibly lose...

31:32.958 --> 31:34.291
Latin.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.993
I know I seem
strong, but

31:35.995 --> 31:38.195
that would utterly destroy me.

31:38.197 --> 31:40.230
MAN:
Well, I am fluent in Latin,

31:40.232 --> 31:41.932
so...
Oh, do shut up!

31:41.934 --> 31:44.201
Please, and I'd appreciate
if you might leave,

31:44.203 --> 31:46.603
as well?
(scoffs)

31:48.207 --> 31:51.041
But I stuffed it myself.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.115
Are you sure?
Our future...
Nothing...

31:58.117 --> 32:00.317
is certain but my
feelings for you.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.953
Yes, I'm sure.

32:02.955 --> 32:06.089
¶ ¶

32:15.701 --> 32:18.702
Whatever it is,
just say it.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.304
I love you.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.139
I love you, too.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.508
(laughs)

32:26.178 --> 32:29.379
(indistinct chatter)

32:30.516 --> 32:32.449
(sighs)

32:32.451 --> 32:35.052
My apologies. I...

32:35.054 --> 32:38.021
I know it's bad luck to see
the bride before her wedding.

32:38.023 --> 32:39.456
Only if you're the groom.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.525
The Spanish have hired a team

32:41.527 --> 32:43.527
of mercenaries for
your journey to Spain.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.063
A group with a particular
talent for assassination.

32:46.065 --> 32:49.032
Queen Mary, is there any reason
the prince would wish you harm?

32:49.034 --> 32:51.268
I've made some choices
that I regret.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.203
Choices that betrayed
his trust.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.272
I didn't mean
to hurt him, but...

32:55.274 --> 32:57.074
The Crown Matrimonial.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.309
I agreed to grant it
to him. I thought

32:59.311 --> 33:02.612
that he would never
be a threat to me.
Mary, if he has recovered,

33:02.614 --> 33:04.348
and he's deceiving you,
then once you're married...

33:04.350 --> 33:05.749
He could have me killed

33:05.751 --> 33:07.751
and still be
the king of Scotland.

33:07.753 --> 33:10.120
And what prince wouldn't want
his own country to rule?

33:10.122 --> 33:11.621
Do you have any evidence?

33:11.623 --> 33:14.224
No. No, mercenaries are
paid well for their silence.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.259
I could confront him.
Oh, he may claim

33:16.261 --> 33:18.028
he's hired these men
for your protection.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.430
I can't back out
of a marriage without cause.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.165
Spain would retaliate.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.501
If I can't prove
that he means to kill me,

33:24.503 --> 33:27.437
perhaps I can prove something
else-- that he's a liar.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.107
Trying to deceive a queen
into marriage.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.441
Your ceremony's in two hours.

33:31.443 --> 33:32.776
How do you expect to prove this?

33:32.778 --> 33:34.378
With a trick.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.346
One my mother taught me.

33:44.556 --> 33:48.725
Don Carlos, are you sure
you want to marry me?

33:48.727 --> 33:52.796
Yes. I... love
you, Mary.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.197
DUKE OF ALBA:
Spain has reviewed

33:54.199 --> 33:55.265
and approved the contracts.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.501
So have I.

33:59.671 --> 34:02.639
Now you sign your name
on each page.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.053
What is it, my prince?

34:16.055 --> 34:17.654
Is something the matter?

34:17.656 --> 34:20.490
Where is the Crown Matrimonial?

34:20.492 --> 34:22.759
Don Carlos,
your hand.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.228
Where is it?!

34:25.230 --> 34:27.097
Prince Don Carlos.
It seems I've been misled.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.632
Or is this
a miraculous recovery?

34:28.634 --> 34:30.434
You switched the contracts,
you Jezebel!

34:30.436 --> 34:32.569
It was a test,
one that you failed.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.438
The prince has
lied to us all

34:34.440 --> 34:37.174
to gain Scotland
under false pretenses.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.609
He was planning to have me
killed en route to Spain.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.111
That is a lie!

34:41.113 --> 34:43.480
I bribed his mercenaries.

34:43.482 --> 34:47.350
This man would murder me
to steal my country!

34:47.352 --> 34:48.852
I deserve a country of my own!

34:48.854 --> 34:50.320
A prince answers
to his father.

34:50.322 --> 34:51.755
A king answers to no one!

34:51.757 --> 34:54.291
(people gasping,
and murmuring)

34:54.293 --> 34:56.093
Go back to Spain.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.362
Federico, these are not
the terms

34:59.364 --> 35:01.231
we agreed upon.
Aren't you going
to say something?

35:01.233 --> 35:02.732
NARCISSE:
No, I'd rather not.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.201
I haven't the faintest idea
what is going on.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.103
But I do know
that now is not

35:06.105 --> 35:08.238
the time for France to
lose Spain's support.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.873
CATHERINE:
This is still my home,
and if the regent

35:09.875 --> 35:13.877
is too cowardly to speak
for France, then I will.

35:13.879 --> 35:15.579
...France empty-handed.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.614
Don Carlos, I hereby
banish you from France.

35:17.616 --> 35:21.218
And if you try to turn King
Phillip against us with lies,

35:21.220 --> 35:24.721
if you attack my country
or Mary in any way, I will not

35:24.723 --> 35:27.124
hesitate to share
with your father

35:27.126 --> 35:29.359
the ghastly details
of your visit.

35:29.361 --> 35:32.395
Take your toy
and your men with you.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.601
(Don Carlos scoffs)

35:49.414 --> 35:51.414
Yes, Your Excellency,

35:51.416 --> 35:53.416
what is it?

35:53.418 --> 35:55.652
NARCISSE:
I'm afraid that I
have some bad news.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.522
France has crippling
military debt.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.790
Had Mary and Don Carlos wed,

36:00.792 --> 36:03.660
then France would have received
a stimulus of Spanish gold,

36:03.662 --> 36:06.663
but since the wedding is
canceled, the debts remains.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.432
Sounds like
a regency problem.
Yes.

36:09.434 --> 36:13.270
And ironically, you will
provide the solution.

36:13.272 --> 36:16.273
I'm marrying you off
to Duke Boinel,

36:16.275 --> 36:18.408
a wealthy noble who will supply
France with the gold

36:18.410 --> 36:21.645
she so desperately needs
in return for your hand.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.947
Absolutely not.
I will not be sold.

36:23.949 --> 36:26.816
Whatever deal you had with
Catherine is now moot.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.518
I am the regent,
and I have decided.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.921
The duke arrives tomorrow.

36:30.923 --> 36:33.690
The wedding will happen quickly,
pending a meeting.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.193
A meeting? I'll gladly take it,

36:36.195 --> 36:37.794
and I will send
this duke running

36:37.796 --> 36:39.629
for the hills, I promise you!

36:39.631 --> 36:41.298
You will not be meeting
with the duke.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.732
King Charles will be.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.402
And once he realizes
just how rich

36:45.404 --> 36:47.971
and decent Duke Boinel is,
I'm confident

36:47.973 --> 36:50.607
that your brother will agree
to this wedding.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.642
This<i> is</i> happening

36:52.644 --> 36:54.411
for the good of France.

36:56.949 --> 37:00.750
Be grateful for
the fun you had.

37:00.752 --> 37:03.386
You must have known
your time would come.

37:10.963 --> 37:13.863
Did anyone see you?
No.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.799
What did you do?

37:15.801 --> 37:18.535
You said Amy was
to be locked away in an asylum!

37:18.537 --> 37:21.471
Lower your voice.
I didn't kill her.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.006
It was you who wanted
her hanged for treason.

37:23.008 --> 37:25.575
Maybe you grew impatient,
silenced her once and for all.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.478
I would never jeopardize
our chance to marry.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.313
I knew that if she died

37:30.315 --> 37:31.748
and we looked
any way responsible,

37:31.750 --> 37:33.650
we could never be together.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.955
Oh, my lord.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.558
Amy.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.995
She knew that, too.

37:44.997 --> 37:48.031
She knew it was the one way
she could keep us apart.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.433
(sighs)

37:50.435 --> 37:52.002
Would she go so far
as to do this?

37:52.004 --> 37:54.771
Frame me for her murder?
How will I prove my innocence?

37:54.773 --> 37:56.339
I sent the servants away,
Elizabeth.

37:56.341 --> 37:58.508
You have to help me
to evade the gallows.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.909
I will do all I can.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.444
We cannot be seen together.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.446
I have my kingdom
and the future

38:03.448 --> 38:05.048
of my reign to consider.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.816
And our child. Wha...?

38:06.818 --> 38:08.652
What of our child?

38:12.591 --> 38:15.525
Elizabeth, that child
gives us motive.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.661
We could both go to the
gallows for Amy's death.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.330
But this child was
to be our greatest blessing,

38:20.332 --> 38:22.299
and what do I do about it?

38:22.301 --> 38:24.334
Robert, what do I do?!

38:26.538 --> 38:28.672
(breath quivering)

38:28.674 --> 38:31.808
(crickets chirping,
bird calling)

38:33.979 --> 38:39.015
So, how does it feel to
be unattached once again?

38:40.585 --> 38:44.321
I feel relieved, I suppose.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.822
Although, today was
hardly a victory.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.857
Scotland needed that alliance.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.360
You did manage to procure
us some much-needed grain

38:50.362 --> 38:53.563
for your country, if
it's any consolation.

38:53.565 --> 38:56.366
It is.

38:56.368 --> 38:58.902
You were right, you know.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.570
I do want love in my life.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.006
Truthfully,
who doesn't want that?

39:03.008 --> 39:05.575
But for me...

39:05.577 --> 39:09.112
as a queen...

39:09.114 --> 39:11.848
oh, I was lucky to have it once.

39:11.850 --> 39:16.486
I need to accept
that, for me,

39:16.488 --> 39:19.556
marriage is likely
a different subject altogether.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.424
Why did you warn me

39:21.426 --> 39:23.560
about the Spanish mercenaries?

39:23.562 --> 39:24.961
I know Elizabeth doesn't want

39:24.963 --> 39:26.830
to take responsibility
for my death,

39:26.832 --> 39:28.998
but she's quite happy
to let someone else do it.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.835
Why save my life?

39:31.837 --> 39:34.738
I assure you my decision
was purely diplomatic.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.374
Elizabeth wouldn't want
Don Carlos ruling Scotland.

39:37.376 --> 39:39.642
A king she distrusts looming
at England's borders?

39:39.644 --> 39:41.111
Perhaps.

39:41.113 --> 39:44.581
Or maybe your loyalty to
Elizabeth is less than absolute?

39:50.122 --> 39:52.822
It's from your daughter
Agatha. I've been

39:52.824 --> 39:55.859
intercepting some of your
correspondence from England.

39:55.861 --> 39:58.895
I didn't believe you when you
told me about your wife before.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.632
But my own spies have confirmed
what happened to her.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.801
And now Elizabeth has
your little girl, doesn't she?

40:04.803 --> 40:07.904
She's using your daughter

40:07.906 --> 40:10.173
to ensure
that you sabotage my alliances.

40:10.175 --> 40:13.576
To have your child taken
from you. I'm so sorry.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.979
I don't want your pity.

40:18.483 --> 40:21.818
Tell your queen
that you single-handedly

40:21.820 --> 40:24.521
sabotaged the alliance
with Spain.

40:24.523 --> 40:26.489
Take the credit, Gideon,
and hopefully,

40:26.491 --> 40:30.660
as a reward, she'll let you
see your child soon.

40:30.662 --> 40:33.430
Mary, there's something
you need to know.

40:33.432 --> 40:35.565
Sooner rather
than later.

40:35.567 --> 40:38.201
There's news of the
Reformation in Scotland,

40:38.203 --> 40:39.769
independent
of Elizabeth.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.638
It's become a Protestant nation.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.840
I know you planned to
go back to Scotland,

40:43.842 --> 40:45.875
but as a Catholic,
if you return now,

40:45.877 --> 40:48.144
you'll be an outsider
in your own country.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.713
They may not welcome you back.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.550
What will you do?

40:53.552 --> 40:56.219
I don't know.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.721
I can't stay in France forever.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.792
But I don't want
your pity, either.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.797
(horse neighs and sputters)
Wear this.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.600
It's a cold night.
Hmm.

41:10.602 --> 41:13.236
Funny. I feel so warm,

41:13.238 --> 41:16.706
as if I were seated
before a roaring fire.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.008
(breathing loudly)

41:19.010 --> 41:21.110
(footsteps approaching)

41:21.112 --> 41:23.746
(breathing loudly)

41:24.850 --> 41:26.716
Are you cold, lover?

41:26.718 --> 41:29.752
Your breath is like frost,
like you're out in winter's air.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.154
But how could you...?

41:31.156 --> 41:33.122
(gasping)

41:33.124 --> 41:35.091
(groaning and whimpering)
