- Boo!
- Amber also boo!

00:36.411 --> 00:38.330
Wish there was another way
to say it, but boo!

00:38.413 --> 00:40.624
Okay, guys, try to understand.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.876
I only wanna add more defenses

00:42.960 --> 00:45.462
so I can keep you all safe
from the Broods.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.756
But we don't like the defenses
you've already added.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.509
I'm always falling into those traps you...

00:50.592 --> 00:54.846
And Amber hate alarm Grug put up.
It keep going off for no reason.

00:54.930 --> 00:58.976
Alert! Broods approaching!
Alert! Broods approaching!

00:59.768 --> 01:01.311
Wait, it's just a log.

Log approaching!
Alert! Log approaching!

01:05.857 --> 01:10.404
I, for one, am sick of having to use
your buddy system.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.697
[panting]

01:11.780 --> 01:15.033
I'm also pretty upset
that no one else would be my buddy.

01:15.117 --> 01:19.329
We no need defenses, Grug.
Broods no attack in long time.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.582
- I concur.
- Hear, hear.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.084
Look, the Broods are clearly
up to something.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.170
They've been sneaking in at night
and leaving those weird symbols.

01:27.254 --> 01:31.550
- Those could be anyone's symbols.
- Down with Grug's defenses!

01:47.107 --> 01:49.151
I need to convince them
the Broods are a threat

01:49.234 --> 01:50.944
so they will put the defenses back up.

01:51.028 --> 01:55.699
But how? I know! With a plan!
But what plan?

01:55.782 --> 01:57.409
I need my stress rock.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.036
[growls]

01:59.119 --> 02:00.329

02:19.473 --> 02:21.808
All right. You win, Sandy.

02:21.892 --> 02:27.147
You can keep your diaper, but what if you
get visited by the diaper monster?

02:27.981 --> 02:31.276
You know, that vicious winged bear owl

02:31.360 --> 02:34.237

Scare tactics?
Just some old schemes of mine.

They're great for tricking babies

for the <i>Ahhh! Valley News.</i>

03:13.610 --> 03:17.614

[puffs]

03:30.252 --> 03:32.796
Much better.
Yes, the Broods have been quiet,

03:32.879 --> 03:37.259
but what if they're just biding time
to do something really awful,

03:37.342 --> 03:40.053
like invent extra-deadly weapons?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.347
[all gasp]

03:45.350 --> 03:48.645
- What an unsettling thought.
- Or worse.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.481
What if they had magic beans
that give them the power

03:51.565 --> 03:52.941
to take any form they please?

03:53.024 --> 03:55.485
Ah! They could be those fruits!

- You got that right. And you first.

04:07.831 --> 04:12.544
Unless we build up our defenses
like our handsome leader Grug wanted.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.713
Quick, dig more traps.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.547
[all grunting]

04:18.091 --> 04:22.512

04:25.557 --> 04:28.977
Hey, don't mind me. I'm just reminding
everybody what the Broods look like.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.188
You know, in case they sneak
into town again.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.940
Amber no remember Broods that big.

and stand back-to-back for rest of life?!

04:46.411 --> 04:47.788
[chuckles]

04:48.580 --> 04:53.001
Okay, class, it's time to recite
the pledge thingy I made for the valley.

04:53.084 --> 04:58.048
We pledge our lives to Ahhh! Valley
and to protect it from the Broods.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.009
[class] We pledge our lives
to Ahhh! Valley

05:01.092 --> 05:03.386
and to protect it from the Broods.

05:03.470 --> 05:07.140
Knowing that if we fail,
they will tear us limb from limb.

05:07.224 --> 05:11.561
[class] Knowing that if we fail,
they will tear us limb from limb.

05:11.645 --> 05:15.106
- [Grug] <i>And tickle us endlessly.</i>
- [class] <i>And tickle us endlessly.</i>

05:15.190 --> 05:17.776

own butts, over and over, for all time.

05:32.332 --> 05:36.586
Great! Now, on to part two.
The Broods shoot venom from their fangs.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.672
[all] The Broods shoot venom
from their fangs.

05:38.755 --> 05:43.343
- Grow horns out of their heads.
- [all] Grow horns out of their heads.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.680
You think you know the enemy,
and then they go and insult you.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.475
I mean, horns on our heads?
That was just Blurg's acne.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.477
Mother, please!

05:52.561 --> 05:58.441
And sure, Frump has fangs, but they're
belly button fangs, not mouth fangs.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.777
Why does my belly button have teeth?

06:00.861 --> 06:01.945
[snaps]

06:02.028 --> 06:04.447
Something's terribly wrong with you.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.576
But that's no reason for Grug
to spread lies, is it?

06:07.659 --> 06:11.288
[growls] This calls for revenge,
doesn't it?

06:12.873 --> 06:16.126
Frump, stop drawing those weird symbols.
They'll know it was us.

06:40.942 --> 06:44.321
Wow, Dad. All these scare tactics
really turned things around, huh?

06:44.404 --> 06:48.158
Yep. We'll all be safe now,
thanks to wonderful fear.

06:48.241 --> 06:53.622

longer to be sure. Still deciding!

don't you dare soil that diaper,

07:16.478 --> 07:20.440
Okay, fine. I will protect you.

07:20.523 --> 07:24.486
- We will double the valley's defenses.
- Only double? Why not triple?

07:24.569 --> 07:27.822
Uh. Well, I don't think
we need to go that far.

07:27.906 --> 07:32.369
- Hey, you some sort of Brood spy?
- What? No!

07:32.452 --> 07:36.623
Huh! That exactly what Brood spy say!

07:36.706 --> 07:38.249
Whoa, whoa!

07:38.333 --> 07:41.503
Easy, guys. Let's not point fingers
at each other now.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.546
But the Broods can change form.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.350
They could be any one of us,
right, brother?

07:45.382 --> 07:47.217
Indeed. Even you, brother.

07:48.301 --> 07:52.305
[both] Not a step closer, brother.
You're no brother of mine, brother.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.390
[all yelling]

07:56.226 --> 08:01.022
- They've lost their minds.
- That's scare tactics for ya.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.733
Fear's good for trickin' people
to take action,

08:03.817 --> 08:06.319
but it gets outta hand real fast.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.155
Surprised I didn't bother to mention that.
Hah!

08:09.239 --> 08:11.116
[moans]

08:11.658 --> 08:16.037
Guys, come on. Pull it together.
None of you are the Broods.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.540
That's right. We are!

08:18.623 --> 08:22.335
You're gonna get it
for truthfully saying I have fangs.

08:22.419 --> 08:26.339
Yep, and for mentioning
Blurg's pimple problem.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.507
Mom!

08:28.633 --> 08:34.347
Hate to disappoint you, Broods,
but you're sorta way outnumbered, so...

08:34.431 --> 08:36.140
Let 'em have it, guys!

08:36.224 --> 08:40.437
- [man] Please. We're no match for you.
- [man 2] Don't spit your venom at us.

08:40.520 --> 08:45.734
Please don't use weird mind powers
to make us cut off our luscious body hair.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.446
Oop, it's just a fear of mine, I guess.

08:49.529 --> 08:54.242
- No, guys, don't be afraid. Get up!
- That's right, sillies.

08:54.325 --> 08:58.705
You don't have to be afraid of us...
if you destroy them.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.636
Ow!

09:13.720 --> 09:15.472
I'm done tricking people to do things.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.848
Ow, ow!

09:16.931 --> 09:18.933
A good leader shouldn't use scare tactics.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.853
He should... ow! He should... ow!

09:21.936 --> 09:25.106
He should... ugh... use brave tactics.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.441
[yelling continues]

09:26.733 --> 09:28.193
Wait, wait!

09:29.402 --> 09:32.238
Before you do us in,
cave ladies and gentle cavemen,

09:32.322 --> 09:34.157
join me for the new...

09:34.240 --> 09:36.034
Ahhh! Valley pledge thingy.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.202
Ahem.

09:37.285 --> 09:41.831
We pledge our lives to Ahhh! Valley,
and to protect it from the Broods,

09:41.915 --> 09:46.711
knowing that if we fail,
we will have the courage to try again.

09:46.795 --> 09:51.591
'Cause no matter how scary our enemy is,
we're strong enough to stand up to 'em.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.718
Like Amber. She's so strong,

09:53.802 --> 09:56.638
she caught a mosquitoad
with her bare hands once, remember?

09:56.721 --> 09:58.014
[onlookers] Ooh!

09:58.098 --> 10:02.435
And Baitsy. One time, he survived
being eaten by three predators.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.856
And I've seen Bud lift one-third
his own weight.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.191
[grunts]

10:10.860 --> 10:11.945
[clapping]

10:12.028 --> 10:14.280
- Ooh! Do me!
- Look, I'm not gonna do everyone.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.133
I can't even remember
all your names right now.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.744
The point is,
we all want to defend our home.

10:19.828 --> 10:24.415
One valley, under sky,
that's got a nice watering hole,

10:24.499 --> 10:27.919
and more reasons for all!

10:28.002 --> 10:29.546

10:32.006 --> 10:34.634
For Ahhh! Valley!

10:35.885 --> 10:36.885
[cheering stops]

10:38.429 --> 10:42.016
You win this time,
but we'll always come back,

10:42.100 --> 10:45.270
just like Blurg's acne problem.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.437
[squeals] Mom!

10:47.856 --> 10:54.237
Fee-fi-fo-fuffer,
now it's time for you to suff...

10:54.320 --> 10:55.989
Wait, what are you doing?

10:56.072 --> 10:57.073
[grunting]

10:57.157 --> 10:59.409
Wait. Don't burst the dam all at once.

[grunts] Fee-fi-fo, I'm out.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.128
[man] Yeah! All right!

11:10.295 --> 11:13.172
Hey, now that the town knows
the Broods are still a threat,

11:13.256 --> 11:14.937
you'll get all the defenses you want, Dad.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.426
Yeah, but you know what, son?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.469
[yelps] Get off!

11:18.553 --> 11:22.223
Anyway, I was saying, I think bravery
is the best defense of all.

11:22.307 --> 11:29.147
Oh, really? Well, you're gonna need
a lot of it, 'cause you're on diaper duty!

[music playing]

11:41.868 --> 11:44.412
And watch, and watch.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.125
And... watch.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.169
[yawning]

11:51.252 --> 11:53.296
- [moans]
- [snores]

11:55.089 --> 11:57.508
And that's how you watch mud dry.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.678
- Now who's ready to try ramu wrangling?
- [shrieks]

12:00.762 --> 12:04.974
I am so ready! Bring on the thing
that can trample me!

12:05.058 --> 12:10.271
Then let's get ready to wrangle!
But first, more from me.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.815
Agh! Let's get to the wrangling already.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.150
[grunts]

12:14.233 --> 12:17.070
Or not. I'll listen to him all day
if it means avoiding that guy.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.030
[gasps]

12:20.073 --> 12:23.326
Now, the ramu's nose is very sensitive.

12:23.409 --> 12:27.288
It can even smell fear,
which I assume smells delicious.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.124
Fortunately, the scent
of some of these berries

12:30.208 --> 12:32.877
will relax the otherwise irritable beast.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.129
Got it. Berries good. Let's do this!

12:35.213 --> 12:37.507
Nighty-night, pea brain!

12:37.590 --> 12:40.927
- [ramu screeches]
- You're getting very relaxed.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.472
- [screeching]
- Why isn't he relaxing?

12:44.555 --> 12:47.642
Because I was referring
to the green berries.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.560
The red ones just make him enraged.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.105
[yells]

12:53.690 --> 12:55.984
Let this be two lessons, students.

12:56.067 --> 13:01.155
Never steal my spotlight
and never jump to conclusions.

13:01.239 --> 13:04.325
Instead, think before you act.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.160
[sniffs]

13:06.786 --> 13:09.414
See? Calm ramu.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.749
Ugh!

13:14.377 --> 13:15.294
[sniffs]

13:15.378 --> 13:16.713
[shrieks]

13:16.796 --> 13:18.464
Angry ramu.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.341
[yells]

13:20.425 --> 13:21.718
[moans]

13:24.887 --> 13:27.640
Now, stay put. One wrong move
and your foot could fall right off.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.768
And if it does, we are not getting you
another one, young lady.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.229
You get two feet in this family
and that is it.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.231
Okay, bye, sweetie.

13:35.314 --> 13:39.694
What am I supposed to do all day?
A girl could die from boredom, too.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.697
Don't worry, Eep. Mom and Dad said
I could stay home with you today

13:42.780 --> 13:46.325
because I'm not really learning
much in school anyway.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.618
[chuckles]

13:47.702 --> 13:51.414
Now, how about a shadow puppet show?

13:51.497 --> 13:55.293
This one's called <i>Croods In Space!</i>

13:55.376 --> 13:57.962
Let's see what tiny spaces
the Croods crawl into this time.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.964
[groans]

14:00.923 --> 14:04.927
[Thunk] The first log was too big.
The second one was too small.

14:05.011 --> 14:08.306
The third was just right
for Thunk to get stuck.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.642
I'm stuck!
This is not part of the act! Help!

14:11.726 --> 14:15.063
[Amber] Secret in Snoot cave
better be good.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.647
Amber got huntin' to do.

14:16.731 --> 14:20.860
Trust me. You will die when you see this.

14:20.943 --> 14:21.819
[chuckles]

14:21.903 --> 14:23.613
[grunts] Ah!

14:24.989 --> 14:26.491
[grunts]

14:31.788 --> 14:33.247
[Amber screams]

14:33.331 --> 14:34.165
[gasps]

14:34.248 --> 14:37.418
- That doesn't sound fun!
- Eep, you're missing my story.

14:38.836 --> 14:39.836
[Eep grunts]

14:39.879 --> 14:43.925
But I think it was... murder.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.886
Or kidnapping. Or... Okay, okay.

14:46.969 --> 14:52.517
I don't know exactly what happened,
but Amber screamed, so it must be bad.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.644
We need to rescue her from Snoot!

14:54.727 --> 14:55.645
Huh.

14:55.728 --> 15:00.233
Amber wasn't at the hunt today.
But kidnapped? By Snoot?

15:00.316 --> 15:01.901
[laughs]

15:01.984 --> 15:04.487
Sorry, it's just, kidnapped by...

15:04.570 --> 15:06.656
[laughs]

15:07.365 --> 15:10.410
Eep, Amber is the toughest
cave person we know,

15:10.493 --> 15:14.831
and Snoot is... well, he once fainted
at the sight of a hangnail.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.250
I don't think you've thought this through.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.876
No, you've gotta listen to me.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.921
Who knows what he's been up to?
Like, what if...

15:22.004 --> 15:23.297
- [slaps]
- [Amber groans]

15:24.382 --> 15:26.426
Now that you're my captive,

15:26.509 --> 15:31.389
I'm going to force-feed you rotten eggs
because... I'm evil.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.890
[cackles]

15:32.974 --> 15:34.559
[moans]

15:35.143 --> 15:39.313
Oh, I don't buy it.
Who doesn't enjoy eating rotten eggs?

15:40.565 --> 15:41.399
[belches]

15:41.482 --> 15:45.194
Listen, Eep, I know it's hard
sitting at home all day,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.488
but that is no reason to make up stories.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.950
And if you're gonna make 'em up,
pick someone more interesting than Snoot.

15:51.033 --> 15:51.868
[Croods yawn]

15:51.951 --> 15:57.039
- Even his name puts me to sleep.
- Fine. I'll get proof.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.499
[sighs]

15:58.583 --> 15:59.583
[grunts]

16:02.295 --> 16:04.130
[grunting]

16:11.679 --> 16:12.680
[groaning]

16:15.016 --> 16:16.142
[yawns]

16:16.225 --> 16:17.059
[moans]

16:17.143 --> 16:19.479
Stay open, eyes!

16:19.562 --> 16:22.732
Don't make me ask Gran to show us
what's under her wrinkles again.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.486
Hah. That's what I thought.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.156
[snores]

16:33.659 --> 16:36.996
Thank you for coming in the middle
of the night without telling anyone.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.749
Now, enter into the cave of Snoot!

16:39.832 --> 16:41.018
- [Snoot's voice echoes]
- [Eep yelps]

16:41.042 --> 16:43.920
Snoot? Did I miss it? I warned you, eyes!

16:44.003 --> 16:46.589
Now, you're definitely
gonna look at... Gran?!

16:46.672 --> 16:51.093
- Gran Crood? I didn't invite you.
- No one ever does.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.846
That's why I invented party crashing,

16:53.930 --> 16:56.641
and I'm not afraid
to use my crashing rock!

16:56.724 --> 16:57.558
[wails]

16:57.642 --> 17:01.604
Now, no need to crash.
The more, the merrier.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.439
[snickers]

17:08.444 --> 17:09.654
[voices screaming within]

17:09.737 --> 17:10.655
[gasps]

17:10.738 --> 17:12.114
Not Gran!

17:12.198 --> 17:13.991
No time to wake the family.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.493
I've got one good foot.
I'll save them myself.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.663
[grunts]

17:18.746 --> 17:19.664
[screams]

17:19.747 --> 17:22.083
Make that no good feet.
But I've still got arms.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.794
Yeah, so I will blindly charge forward.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.378
[screams] Ow!

17:26.462 --> 17:29.966
Oh, come on. We still got a chin.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.177
Just... hang... on... Gran.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.846
I'm on my way.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.808
[slithering]

17:40.059 --> 17:41.310
Or not.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.438
[Eep] Mom, Dad, listen to me.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.650
Snoot captured more people
last night, including Gran.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.153
Huh. I guess she is gone.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.322
- Nice.
- [thumps]

17:53.406 --> 17:56.617
Honey, you are jumping
to conclusions again.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.910
Gran's like a teenager.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.870
She's always sneaking out at night,

17:59.954 --> 18:02.331
she never wants to be seen
in public with me,

18:02.415 --> 18:05.793
and she has a lot of backne.

18:05.876 --> 18:06.711
Ugh!

18:06.794 --> 18:10.006
No. Snoot's got her in his cave,
doing who knows what.

18:10.089 --> 18:14.343
Gah! What have you done?

18:14.427 --> 18:17.888
You're right.
I've made a horrible mistake.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.098
This one's crooked.

18:20.975 --> 18:21.809
[laughs]

18:21.892 --> 18:23.227
[gasping]

18:23.311 --> 18:26.731
[screams] Please! We gotta do something!

18:26.814 --> 18:31.277
Fine. We'll go see what Snoot's up to
once you stop choking us.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.445
And just to be clear,

18:32.528 --> 18:36.282
no one would choose to look at Gran's face
every day, on a wall or otherwise.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.080
Please don't be wall heads.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.045
Mom says everything is okay.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.128
[gasps]

18:51.047 --> 18:52.715
Oh, no. Snoot's coming.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.320
- Come look at what's in my cave.
- Sure, that doesn't sound threatening.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.930
No. No, no, no, no, no, no!
Do not go in the cave!

19:01.724 --> 19:03.017
[voices screaming within]

19:03.100 --> 19:06.354
Why are they screaming, Eep?
Why? You were right.

19:06.437 --> 19:10.733
Now you got me thinking about the horrible
things Snoot might be doing, like...

19:10.816 --> 19:12.068
Tickle torture!

19:12.818 --> 19:14.111
[Croods laughing]

19:15.279 --> 19:18.282
What? No. It's probably way worse.

19:18.366 --> 19:22.036
- You don't mean...?
- Extreme tickle torture!

19:22.119 --> 19:23.579
[laughing]

19:24.455 --> 19:25.455
[whimpering]

19:25.498 --> 19:26.791
There's only one thing to do.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.543
We must stop Snoot,
but I can't, due to my foot.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.463
And you can't, due to... other reasons,

19:32.546 --> 19:35.716
and Snoot has Mom and Dad
and Gran and Amber.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.094
So we need something strong to stop him.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.553
Something like, um...

19:39.637 --> 19:42.014
[gasps] a battering ramu.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.517
Uh, isn't there a safer idea?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.977
Probably, but there's no time to think.
Only time to smash.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.312
- [vine cracks]
- [Thunk yells]

19:49.730 --> 19:53.734
- [Thunk] This is not Thunk work.
- We're almost there.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.337
I'll keep the ramu and green berries here

19:55.361 --> 19:57.005
while you go smash
the red berries on Snoot.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.156
Then, whammo! I mean, rammo!

19:59.240 --> 20:00.533
[man screaming]

20:00.616 --> 20:01.867
[both gasp]

20:01.951 --> 20:02.951
[Thunk sighs]

20:03.869 --> 20:06.205
Run, Thunk! Run like the wind!

20:06.288 --> 20:07.707
[panting]

20:08.165 --> 20:10.209
Or at least like a light breeze.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.293
[panting]

20:12.503 --> 20:13.503
[smashes]

20:15.423 --> 20:16.757
[sniffs]

20:16.966 --> 20:20.052
Hurry! It's starting to catch
the foul scent!

20:20.136 --> 20:25.516
Well, I did roll on an extra layer
of mold today. Thanks for noticing.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.685
Gran? But Snoot put your head on a wall.

20:27.768 --> 20:32.606
What? No. Oh, I ain't nobody's trophy.

20:32.690 --> 20:35.818
<i>Snoot just invited me to the cool
new space under his cave.</i>

20:35.901 --> 20:38.571
<i>He calls it a "wreck room,"</i>

20:38.654 --> 20:40.906
<i>'cause it wrecks your ability
to do anything else.</i>

20:40.990 --> 20:42.575
Half the valley's down there.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.993
Oh.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.413
So... nobody was kidnapped
into a cave of horrors?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.206
Kidnapped? By Snoot?

20:49.290 --> 20:50.624
[laughs]

20:51.584 --> 20:52.877
What were you thinking?

20:52.960 --> 20:56.297
I wasn't thinking. [gasps] Thunk, stop!

20:56.380 --> 20:58.048
Hmm? Uh-oh!

20:58.132 --> 20:59.508
- [gasps]
- [gasps]

21:01.761 --> 21:03.304
[sniffs]

21:04.388 --> 21:05.431
[shrieks]

21:07.600 --> 21:08.600
[snaps]

21:08.893 --> 21:10.186
[screeches]

21:11.187 --> 21:12.688
[Thunk screams]

21:13.814 --> 21:15.055
- [Thunk yelps]
- [ramu shrieks]

21:15.399 --> 21:16.400
[screams]

21:17.193 --> 21:19.862
Thunk, hold on! I'll calm it down!

21:19.945 --> 21:20.988
[screaming continues]

21:21.071 --> 21:22.281
[groans]

21:24.533 --> 21:25.534
[screaming continues]

21:28.204 --> 21:29.038
[gasps]

21:29.121 --> 21:32.833
No, no, this is my last berry.
I need to think before I act.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.795
Whoa. Did I just learn something?

21:35.878 --> 21:38.255
[gasps] Did a student
just learn something?

21:40.299 --> 21:41.634
[screaming]

21:45.638 --> 21:46.972
Got it!

21:54.271 --> 21:55.271
[snaps]

21:56.941 --> 21:57.941
[trumpets]

21:58.484 --> 21:59.485
[screaming]

22:00.319 --> 22:01.195
[grunts, gasps]

22:01.278 --> 22:02.988
[ramu screeching]

22:06.742 --> 22:07.827
[sniffs]

22:07.910 --> 22:09.119
[Thunk whimpers]

22:09.203 --> 22:10.203
[ramu coos]

22:10.663 --> 22:12.706
[gasps] Huh?

22:12.790 --> 22:13.833
[sighs]

22:13.916 --> 22:15.835
[chuckles] You're cute.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.379
- No tickling.
- What are you Croods doing?

22:18.462 --> 22:22.508
We... just wanted to check out
your wreck room.

22:22.591 --> 22:27.596
Sure. We'll have such a killer time,
I promise, you'll never leave.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.266
Yeah, you really need
to stop talking like that.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.810
You can move your hands now.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.771
[people cheering, laughing]

22:35.854 --> 22:37.523
[Eep, Thunk scream]

22:39.108 --> 22:41.902
Yes, it tends to get that reaction.
