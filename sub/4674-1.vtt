00:24.922 --> 00:30.338
<i>I start with something fairly simple,
something you've seen countless times.</i>

00:30.463 --> 00:32.880
<i>A tree, for instance.</i>

00:34.963 --> 00:37.755
<i>An oak.</i>

00:37.880 --> 00:40.713
<i>On a field or something.</i>

00:46.297 --> 00:48.630
<i>The bark.</i>

00:48.755 --> 00:55.380
<i>The cracks in the bark, the knots
or whatever you call them.</i>

00:57.047 --> 01:01.213
<i>Smaller things are easier to visualise.
A dog, a...</i>

01:03.213 --> 01:05.463
<i>A German Shepherd.</i>

01:09.838 --> 01:16.755
<i>Places are harder. It helps if I knew
them well before it happened.</i>

01:16.880 --> 01:21.755
<i>The apartment we used to live in,
our favourite restaurant, -</i>

01:21.880 --> 01:27.255
<i>- my husband's office or
that shopping centre downtown.</i>

01:28.838 --> 01:33.505
<i>You have to use your memories.
Take care not to be derailed.</i>

01:33.630 --> 01:36.088
<i>And start to associate.</i>

01:37.338 --> 01:39.547
<i>They're not really memories.</i>

01:39.672 --> 01:44.338
<i>Nobody can remember a whole building.
Not every single detail.</i>

01:50.713 --> 01:54.797
<i>They say that my ability
to visualise will fade away.</i>

01:54.922 --> 01:59.130
<i>That the optic nerves wither
without new impressions.</i>

01:59.255 --> 02:04.922
<i>But I can slow it down. If I work
on it every day, I can maintain it.</i>

02:06.755 --> 02:10.130
<i>I used to ask my husband
if I'd got it right.</i>

02:10.255 --> 02:13.713
<i>If that shopping centre
was blue or white.</i>

02:13.838 --> 02:18.130
<i>He'd check it on Google Earth
or something.</i>

02:18.255 --> 02:23.255
<i>But it's not important what's real
as long as I can visualise it clearly.</i>

02:55.963 --> 02:58.047
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

05:26.088 --> 05:28.505
Is that you?

05:32.755 --> 05:35.172
Are you there?

06:38.755 --> 06:41.797
<i>..."t" often becomes "d", for instance.</i>

06:41.922 --> 06:46.005
<i>Many words, I would think
most of the vocabulary, -</i>

06:46.130 --> 06:52.088
<i>- is the same in German and Norwegian.
For instance the numbers.</i>

06:52.213 --> 06:55.088
<i>- They're alike.
- What else?</i>

07:22.588 --> 07:27.047
<i>It came and went. He streamed
and downloaded vast amounts, -</i>

07:27.172 --> 07:31.005
<i>- watched it, masturbated,
saw more, did it again.</i>

07:31.130 --> 07:35.797
<i>Maybe as often as four or five times
a day, at least once or twice.</i>

07:35.922 --> 07:39.172
<i>Then, loathing himself,
he erased it all.</i>

07:39.297 --> 07:44.880
<i>Only to start downloading again,
masturbate, delete everything etc.</i>

07:45.005 --> 07:49.172
<i>It was there waiting for him.
Everything was accessible.</i>

07:49.297 --> 07:52.588
<i>Nothing seemed to have been left out.</i>

07:58.047 --> 08:04.088
<i>The artificial dialogue bothered him.
The awkward attempts at being sexy.</i>

08:04.213 --> 08:07.047
<i>But the sex was real enough.</i>

08:21.297 --> 08:26.380
<i>Einar didn't know why, but he
got kicks from specific things.</i>

08:26.505 --> 08:29.005
<i>He had actual fetishes.</i>

08:37.755 --> 08:40.797
<i>He found uncharted
waters within himself</i>

08:40.922 --> 08:44.005
<i>Weird perversions
he thought were unique.</i>

08:44.130 --> 08:47.797
<i>But even they had been
categorised long ago, -</i>

08:47.922 --> 08:50.547
<i>- made searchable for everyone.</i>

08:53.297 --> 08:57.922
<i>He envied girls. No matter how
they looked, what they lacked -</i>

08:58.047 --> 09:02.713
<i>- in terms of the ideal,
there were men who wanted them, -</i>

09:02.838 --> 09:08.213
<i>- who celebrated them on websites
and file sharing networks.</i>

09:11.213 --> 09:15.755
<i>Not everything appealed
that much to him.</i>

09:15.880 --> 09:21.047
<i>But who was he to judge?
Some things he never grew tired of</i>

09:21.588 --> 09:26.797
<i>High heels. The urge to watch naked
men surrounded by clothed women.</i>

09:26.922 --> 09:30.172
<i>And long hair in every variety.</i>

09:31.922 --> 09:37.297
<i>But eventually the most
hard-core porn lost its attraction.</i>

09:37.422 --> 09:42.088
<i>He needed something mundane
in the girls he masturbated to.</i>

09:56.463 --> 10:00.463
<i>He loved stilettos, but women's legs
seemed more real -</i>

10:00.588 --> 10:03.380
<i>- when they ended up in slippers.</i>

10:16.380 --> 10:21.005
<i>He still watched rougher stuff.
It had its uses.</i>

10:21.130 --> 10:23.463
<i>But it wasn't really him.</i>

10:23.588 --> 10:27.880
<i>Being close to a warm, breathing
woman was something else.</i>

10:55.172 --> 10:58.588
<i>The female body held
no secrets for Einar.</i>

10:58.713 --> 11:03.963
<i>He could instantly distinguish and
categorise the bodies passing by.</i>

11:04.088 --> 11:10.213
<i>But the Internet couldn't tell him how
it would feel to touch these bodies.</i>

11:10.338 --> 11:14.880
<i>Or if they touched him.
Two soft breasts against your back.</i>

11:15.005 --> 11:17.797
<i>Fingers gently stroking your neck.</i>

11:42.255 --> 11:44.338
Hello?

11:45.755 --> 11:48.922
I got your message,
but I was already...

11:49.047 --> 11:52.630
<i>He'll start telling me
how his day has been.</i>

11:52.755 --> 11:55.130
<i>Then, almost casually, -</i>

11:55.255 --> 11:58.130
<i>- ask me what I've done today.</i>

11:59.130 --> 12:04.922
<i>He's trying to say that I should start
going out again, not just stay in here.</i>

14:12.213 --> 14:14.880
<i>With supernatural abilities?</i>

14:15.005 --> 14:17.588
<i>No, but almost.</i>

14:17.713 --> 14:23.255
<i>Does he have a sense of taste besides
sweet, salt, sour, umami and bitter?</i>

14:23.380 --> 14:27.005
<i>- An obstacle?
- A potential obstacle?</i>

14:27.130 --> 14:30.630
<i>- Can he lick his way through?
- That's not it.</i>

14:30.755 --> 14:35.797
<i>But people win the lottery.
Maybe it's nothing but luck?</i>

14:35.922 --> 14:42.380
<i>Let's discuss the eternal question:
What's worse, being blind or deaf?</i>

14:42.505 --> 14:47.797
<i>As a musician of sorts,
I'd really hate being deaf</i>

14:47.922 --> 14:51.672
<i>But at the same time,
I really love porn, so...</i>

14:51.797 --> 14:55.880
<i>It wouldn't be so hot if you’re
just left with the mood.</i>

15:01.630 --> 15:05.547
<i>Elin moved to Oslo from Sweden
over ten years ago -</i>

15:05.672 --> 15:08.463
<i>- to study and work part-time.</i>

15:08.588 --> 15:12.422
<i>A newly divorced mother
with a ten-year-old child.</i>

15:12.547 --> 15:17.505
<i>She took the consequence
of their dysfunctional relationship.</i>

15:17.630 --> 15:20.463
<i>Having nothing in common but their son.</i>

15:20.588 --> 15:24.297
<i>He'd ignored it,
escaping into his work.</i>

15:24.422 --> 15:28.588
<i>Elin invited their friends
to dinner in her new apartment.</i>

15:28.713 --> 15:33.838
<i>To the movies. For drinks.
They came. It was like old times.</i>

15:33.963 --> 15:39.297
<i>But they never invited her in return.
Never contacted her.</i>

15:40.755 --> 15:46.713
<i>She finally got the message. They'd
originally been her husband's friends.</i>

15:46.838 --> 15:49.172
<i>They still were.</i>

15:49.297 --> 15:52.130
<i>Her friends in Sweden were far away.</i>

15:52.255 --> 15:57.172
<i>Updates on Facebook from lives
she'd lost touch with long ago.</i>

16:00.838 --> 16:03.213
<i>Elin met people at work.</i>

16:03.338 --> 16:08.047
<i>Weekends and holidays when
she didn't have her son, were worst.</i>

16:09.130 --> 16:15.130
<i>The spare time, all she'd loved about
being a teacher, turned against her.</i>

16:21.213 --> 16:27.755
<i>What would she have done without him?
He was the one who made it worthwhile.</i>

16:27.880 --> 16:32.630
<i>But she began to notice that
it was always just the two of them, -</i>

16:32.755 --> 16:38.713
<i>- going to the movies, for walks
in the park or to the beach.</i>

16:39.505 --> 16:44.130
<i>She regretted not knowing
other couples with children.</i>

16:44.255 --> 16:48.672
<i>She'd been a shy, lonely child,
just like Kim was.</i>

16:48.797 --> 16:51.547
<i>She didn't want to make it worse.</i>

16:53.422 --> 16:56.630
<i>But it was forgotten
before the weekend.</i>

16:56.755 --> 17:00.713
<i>It was Friday. Her ex-husband
would come by with him.</i>

17:00.838 --> 17:04.213
<i>Uh... Her.</i>

17:14.880 --> 17:18.797
- You there already?
<i>- I know it's your weekend, but...</i>

17:18.922 --> 17:22.797
<i>Kim's made friends with
Hanne's friend's daughter.</i>

17:22.922 --> 17:26.338
<i>She lives nearby, and...</i>

17:26.463 --> 17:30.463
- Yes, and...?
<i>- Well, there's like...</i>

17:30.588 --> 17:35.130
<i>They've got something on this evening,
and she'd like to...</i>

17:36.172 --> 17:39.797
<i>Kim? Can you have a word with mom?</i>

17:39.922 --> 17:42.213
<i>- Hi, mom.</i>
- Hi, darling.

17:42.338 --> 17:47.005
<i>- Mom? You know Kristine?</i>
- The one who dances?

17:47.130 --> 17:52.088
<i>No, that's Tiril.
But she'll be there as well.</i>

17:52.213 --> 17:57.713
And you want to be with them?
Well, I think you should.

17:57.838 --> 18:01.505
But you'll have to stay
with dad this weekend.

18:01.630 --> 18:04.338
Is that okay? Good.

18:04.463 --> 18:08.422
We'll find something
extra fun to do on Monday.

18:09.672 --> 18:13.547
<i>But mom...
What are you going to do?</i>

18:16.088 --> 18:22.005
Well, actually it's alright by me.
Some old friends of mine are in town.

18:22.130 --> 18:25.630
I can meet them this evening.

18:25.755 --> 18:29.422
<i>But who are they?</i>

18:29.547 --> 18:34.922
Just some old friends, girls I got
to know when I was a waitress.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.338
<i>Okay.</i>

18:37.463 --> 18:40.130
<i>But what are they called?</i>

18:41.963 --> 18:43.963
Turid and Kristine.

18:44.088 --> 18:47.755
<i>- Is her name Kristine as well?</i>
- Yeah.

18:48.422 --> 18:51.255
But darling, we...

18:51.380 --> 18:55.547
- Enjoy yourself. We'll talk soon.
<i>- Kisses.</i>

18:55.672 --> 18:57.838
- Kisses.
<i>- Bye.</i>

20:15.297 --> 20:20.797
<i>- It can sense things at...
- At a distance?</i>

20:28.588 --> 20:31.838
<i>I can still see in my dreams.</i>

20:31.963 --> 20:36.380
<i>I wake up. After a few seconds
I remember that I can't see.</i>

20:38.630 --> 20:44.213
<i>I was out dancing. Suddenly I noticed
a spot on my contact lens.</i>

20:44.338 --> 20:48.213
<i>I rinsed it, danced more.
It was still there, -</i>

20:48.338 --> 20:50.922
<i>- but I ignored it.</i>

20:51.047 --> 20:55.463
<i>It was still there the next day,
even without lenses.</i>

20:55.588 --> 21:00.797
<i>Before I could see a specialist,
it appeared on the other eye too.</i>

21:00.922 --> 21:03.797
<i>It usually affects night vision first.</i>

21:03.922 --> 21:08.255
<i>Then it deteriorates quickly
or slowly. It depends.</i>

21:17.463 --> 21:22.713
<i>Sometimes I get the feeling there's
something about the acoustics.</i>

21:22.838 --> 21:27.047
<i>It doesn't feel like the ceiling is
as tall as he says.</i>

21:28.130 --> 21:32.713
<i>I don't know how the apartment looks.
I just picture something.</i>

21:32.838 --> 21:38.047
<i>He says it's light and airy,
high up, so nobody can see inside.</i>

21:43.172 --> 21:47.588
<i>Maybe he thought, when I said
I wanted to move, and came along -</i>

21:47.713 --> 21:52.797
<i>- to see the new apartment, I'd decided
to start going outside again.</i>

21:55.047 --> 21:58.922
<i>He doesn't say so,
but he must be disappointed.</i>

22:28.380 --> 22:33.172
Excuse me? What...
What are you listening to?

22:33.297 --> 22:37.547
- Isn't that Stockholms Negrer?
- Yeah. The first album.

22:37.672 --> 22:39.797
You recognised it?

22:39.922 --> 22:44.505
- I didn't know they had fans in Norway.
- Not that many, no.

23:12.422 --> 23:14.505
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

23:46.297 --> 23:50.088
<i>- Done. The door is open.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

23:52.588 --> 23:54.838
<i>The door is closed.</i>

25:20.713 --> 25:23.922
<i>Sometimes I get
the feeling he's here.</i>

25:24.047 --> 25:29.505
<i>That he's still in the apartment.
I don't say anything.</i>

25:29.630 --> 25:34.213
<i>He’d just tell me to stop sitting
around here imagining stuff.</i>

25:36.338 --> 25:39.338
<i>He'd never do anything like that.</i>

25:42.463 --> 25:45.922
<i>But the floor in the hall
doesn't creak much.</i>

25:46.047 --> 25:51.130
<i>One long step into the living room,
and he'd reach the thick carpet.</i>

25:51.255 --> 25:55.880
<i>And then he could just sit down
and watch me.</i>

25:56.005 --> 25:58.088
<i>Pink grey.</i>

26:01.297 --> 26:04.588
<i>Dark... Dark grey violet.</i>

26:13.588 --> 26:17.088
<i>Dark green. Deep green.</i>

26:19.880 --> 26:24.422
<i>Pale pink. Pale salmon pink.</i>

26:25.672 --> 26:30.005
<i>Dark violet. Deep violet.</i>

26:39.880 --> 26:42.422
<i>White. White.</i>

26:47.880 --> 26:50.755
<i>White. White.</i>

26:55.255 --> 26:59.547
- What?
- Get up. Come on, get up.

27:06.130 --> 27:08.922
<i>Baby pink. Baby pink.</i>

27:57.505 --> 27:59.630
Morten?

28:01.797 --> 28:04.005
Oh, hi. Wow.

28:05.297 --> 28:08.338
- It's been a while.
- Hello.

28:08.463 --> 28:13.380
So how are you?
Have you got kids and so on?

28:14.547 --> 28:18.588
Remember that girl
I used to deal with when...

28:18.713 --> 28:22.047
The pretty one studying Norwegian?
Yeah.

28:22.172 --> 28:25.963
- She'd flash her tits when drunk.
- That's right.

28:26.088 --> 28:28.172
- Look.
- Wow.

28:28.297 --> 28:31.797
Married? Whoa.

28:31.922 --> 28:34.422
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.338
What's she doing now?

28:37.463 --> 28:40.755
She worked as a teacher
for years, but...

28:40.880 --> 28:43.463
Not right now.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.630
So what are you doing now?

28:49.422 --> 28:52.838
It sort of ground to a halt
after the university.

28:52.963 --> 28:56.255
Okay.
It's been known to happen.

29:00.255 --> 29:05.130
I had to say I was going to the gym.
Working out is approved alone time.

29:05.255 --> 29:09.505
- But going to the movies...
- That won't wash.

29:13.422 --> 29:18.588
<i>At the student film club, Einar had
once suggested a Star Trek evening.</i>

29:18.713 --> 29:23.672
<i>He wasn't a fan, but thought it would
attract people. Morten opposed it.</i>

29:23.797 --> 29:29.963
<i>For a long time, Einar thought Morten
had mistaken him for a trekkie.</i>

29:33.713 --> 29:38.005
<i>And the film they’d just seen
was a sort of sci-fi.</i>

29:38.130 --> 29:43.297
<i>Maybe Morten thought that was why he
was there, that he was a sci-fi buff.</i>

29:44.672 --> 29:48.338
You know, that Star Trek thing?

29:48.463 --> 29:51.838
I'm really not a big fan.

29:51.963 --> 29:55.797
Oh no? Okay.

29:58.755 --> 30:02.922
You know that Leonard Nimoy's
a decent photographer?

30:03.047 --> 30:06.672
No, I didn't know that.
The guy with the ears?

30:06.797 --> 30:09.130
Right.

30:09.255 --> 30:12.047
- Black-and-white.
- Okay.

30:12.172 --> 30:14.130
Good stuff.

30:14.838 --> 30:18.047
- You still watch a lot of movies?
- Yeah.

30:18.172 --> 30:21.630
- I haven't seen you here before.
- No.

30:21.755 --> 30:25.672
No, I get tired of
going alone all the time.

30:26.755 --> 30:30.630
- Is it that bad?
- No, I just...

30:30.755 --> 30:36.588
You know, I had like... anxiety issues.
Couldn't take the exams, and...

30:36.713 --> 30:42.755
So it basically ended with me
and the PC, staying at home.

30:44.213 --> 30:47.547
Well, that's a bummer.

30:48.547 --> 30:54.422
<i>Maybe it was the Waldorf school. Or his
parents' divorce when his sister was six.</i>

30:54.547 --> 31:01.172
<i>But a large part of Morten's self-image
was about being there for others.</i>

31:05.463 --> 31:10.213
<i>A colleague of Morten had
mentioned all the casual sex -</i>

31:10.338 --> 31:14.922
<i>- on offer on Internet dating sites.</i>

31:15.047 --> 31:18.963
<i>Morten had spent a lot of time
thinking about it afterwards.</i>

31:19.088 --> 31:23.755
Have you... I know it sounds stupid,
but they say it works.

31:23.880 --> 31:27.755
Have you tried online dating?

31:27.880 --> 31:30.047
Yeah.

31:30.172 --> 31:33.880
- I've actually tried it.
- And?

31:34.005 --> 31:39.255
Nobody wants to be with someone
who has issues. Not in the long run.

31:41.255 --> 31:43.588
But you're a great guy.

31:43.713 --> 31:47.172
I've always thought of you
as really funny.

31:47.297 --> 31:49.713
- You mean it?
- Of course.

31:49.838 --> 31:53.755
- You wrote for the student revue.
- One sketch.

31:53.880 --> 32:00.172
But it was good. Really funny.
Many people are into that stuff.

32:00.297 --> 32:05.422
I've thought about it
from time to time. That it might be -

32:05.547 --> 32:11.422
- something I could do professionally.
Writing for TV. Comedy.

32:11.547 --> 32:13.713
You should.

32:14.713 --> 32:17.630
I get these ideas, like.

32:17.755 --> 32:22.505
But they're really over the top.
People would be shocked.

32:22.630 --> 32:25.130
Shocked is good.

32:25.255 --> 32:28.213
- You mean it?
- I certainly do.

32:28.338 --> 32:30.755
Maybe I will.

32:38.963 --> 32:41.505
Well, I have to go.

32:41.630 --> 32:44.463
I can't stay in the gym forever.

32:47.463 --> 32:52.338
Are there any movies coming up
that are worth watching?

32:52.463 --> 32:55.088
The director's cut of "Mask".

32:55.213 --> 32:58.630
On Wednesday?
They say it's much better.

32:58.755 --> 33:03.255
Would it be alright by you
if I turned up on Wednesday?

33:03.380 --> 33:06.380
Of course. Cool.
I'll see you there.

33:06.505 --> 33:09.422
- Good luck writing. Bye.
- Bye.

33:10.505 --> 33:12.963
<i>What a mess.</i>

33:52.922 --> 33:59.213
<i>It gets messy when I write what comes
to mind. I should think things through.</i>

33:59.338 --> 34:02.047
<i>Wait until I can see it clearly.</i>

37:11.297 --> 37:14.463
<i>I don't say
I'll never go outside again.</i>

37:14.588 --> 37:18.255
<i>I just say the apartment
is enough for now.</i>

37:18.380 --> 37:22.588
<i>Then they can think I'll change
my mind at some point.</i>

37:26.588 --> 37:29.088
<i>But he probably knows.</i>

37:29.213 --> 37:33.547
<i>There's something different
about him now.</i>

37:33.672 --> 37:36.255
<i>As if he's made up his mind.</i>

38:42.797 --> 38:47.297
Ove-Kenneth had it made for the party.
That's the office section.

38:47.422 --> 38:52.422
The elevator shaft. It's more detailed
than the model for the contest.

38:52.547 --> 38:57.880
It's got a great view of the fjord.
Eleven stories tall at the most.

38:58.005 --> 39:02.630
That's the old office building.
We couldn't tear it down.

39:02.755 --> 39:05.588
Now it's completely integrated.

39:07.505 --> 39:10.797
It slopes down.

39:10.922 --> 39:17.172
If you go further down,
you can feel the portal.

39:17.297 --> 39:22.255
It lifts it. We wanted to minimise
the area occupied by the building.

39:22.380 --> 39:26.547
- No, that's just trees.
- I can't visualise it.

39:26.672 --> 39:31.172
- Sorry. I'm useless.
- No, I should explain it better.

39:31.297 --> 39:34.213
No, that's not it.

39:36.172 --> 39:42.588
At least you know something about
what people will be admiring on Friday.

40:13.963 --> 40:17.130
Has my hair turned greyer lately?

40:17.255 --> 40:20.838
No, I don't think so.
You look great.

40:23.005 --> 40:25.088
You sure?

40:59.922 --> 41:02.088
Are you working?

41:06.880 --> 41:11.380
- What is it?
- Just some mails.

41:11.505 --> 41:17.463
Ove-Kenneth forgot some invitations.
I have to gloss over the short notice.

41:19.047 --> 41:22.422
- Are many people coming?
- Quite a few.

41:22.547 --> 41:25.672
Good. Then nobody will miss me.

41:49.588 --> 41:51.672
Can we talk?

41:56.422 --> 41:58.505
What are you doing?

42:03.672 --> 42:05.088
Is your cock hard?

42:12.588 --> 42:14.672
Yes.

42:17.047 --> 42:21.922
I want to feel it in my throat.
Fuck my mouth, hard.

42:24.463 --> 42:26.547
Yeah.

42:26.672 --> 42:28.880
Pretty hard.

42:32.547 --> 42:34.588
I'm gagging! Don't stop!

42:36.922 --> 42:39.130
Can you breathe?

42:41.172 --> 42:43.255
What is it?

42:44.255 --> 42:46.588
Nothing.

42:46.713 --> 42:48.672
<i>No, he'd never dare.</i>

42:58.172 --> 43:00.547
Is she there?

43:00.672 --> 43:03.338
Yeah. I have to go.

43:08.588 --> 43:12.755
You're so kind.
That's why I like you so much.

43:15.005 --> 43:18.213
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

43:18.338 --> 43:22.838
- I just had to stretch out. I'm sorry.
- What was that about?

43:22.963 --> 43:25.047
You meant it.

43:36.422 --> 43:39.963
I'm squeezing your balls!
Come down my throat!

43:45.338 --> 43:47.422
Are you tired?

43:48.547 --> 43:50.630
Yeah, a bit.

44:00.005 --> 44:02.922
Are you smiling?

44:03.047 --> 44:05.338
Why do you ask?

44:05.463 --> 44:07.963
It's just weird not to know.

44:11.422 --> 44:14.088
Still just stretching out?

44:14.213 --> 44:19.213
When I smile at you,
I don't know if you see it.

44:19.338 --> 44:22.338
We'll have to say so.

44:22.463 --> 44:25.630
- Tell each other we're smiling?
- Yeah.

44:29.713 --> 44:32.380
Are you looking at me now?

44:32.505 --> 44:34.588
Yeah.

45:10.672 --> 45:13.338
Hey...

45:14.630 --> 45:17.755
- What is it?
- Nothing.

45:34.297 --> 45:37.880
<i>I no longer know how I look.
I have a memory of it.</i>

45:38.005 --> 45:40.922
<i>But I guess I've let myself go.</i>

45:43.172 --> 45:48.380
<i>It must feel weird to get a blowjob
from a blind woman, even your wife.</i>

45:48.505 --> 45:53.547
<i>It probably makes him feel guilty,
as if he's exploiting me or something.</i>

45:53.672 --> 46:00.005
<i>The poor guy probably feels obliged to
give the handicapped woman a sex life.</i>

46:00.713 --> 46:02.797
Do you have kids?

46:06.297 --> 46:09.838
We tried for a long time,
but now it's...

46:11.588 --> 46:13.672
No.

46:25.463 --> 46:30.130
- Why don't you just leave?
- I want to. But I can't. Not now.

46:39.588 --> 46:43.047
- What's wrong with her?
- It's complicated.

46:50.172 --> 46:52.838
It must be hard. For you.

46:54.755 --> 46:56.797
Thanks.

46:58.255 --> 47:00.088
Will you meet me?

47:08.588 --> 47:12.005
Yes. Love to.

47:56.630 --> 47:59.172
Hello? Are you there?

48:00.547 --> 48:03.213
Sorry.

48:03.338 --> 48:07.380
The lights went out for a moment.

51:16.380 --> 51:18.255
Hi.

51:51.963 --> 51:55.172
<i>Einar started to think back
once more, -</i>

51:55.297 --> 51:58.797
<i>- to the last time he'd felt happy.</i>

52:05.380 --> 52:10.422
<i>It was the day after. He was heading
to town to check out the damage, -</i>

52:10.547 --> 52:14.755
<i>- when he realised the full extent
of what had happened.</i>

52:17.963 --> 52:22.172
<i>This was his town.
And that jerk had just...</i>

52:26.630 --> 52:29.797
<i>It was different now.
People noticed him.</i>

52:29.922 --> 52:33.547
<i>They saw him.
They were together in this.</i>

52:33.672 --> 52:38.380
<i>It was like a promise.
We wouldn't let that guy get to us.</i>

52:38.505 --> 52:44.213
<i>We'd come through this together,
with greater solidarity, more love.</i>

52:44.338 --> 52:47.047
<i>It was just so beautiful.</i>

52:54.588 --> 52:59.630
<i>Going home, he stopped by the cordon
outside the government complex.</i>

52:59.755 --> 53:03.505
<i>Amid the broken glass
and roses, he thought:</i>

53:03.630 --> 53:08.172
<i>"I feel good now. Now I'm happy."</i>

53:12.963 --> 53:17.838
<i>But people soon lost sight of it.
Everyday life returned.</i>

53:19.838 --> 53:24.422
<i>Einar felt he had to remind people
of how serious it was.</i>

53:38.505 --> 53:44.130
<i>There was increasing distrust of
loners, specially men. He could tell.</i>

53:47.588 --> 53:50.338
<i>He still thought about the quote:</i>

53:50.463 --> 53:54.463
<i>"How one man's hate could
unite us all in love."</i>

53:54.588 --> 53:57.588
<i>But what about Einar's love?</i>

54:04.547 --> 54:06.630
Elin?

54:08.380 --> 54:10.463
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:11.713 --> 54:13.755
Hi.

54:14.755 --> 54:17.838
- Well, are you okay?
- Absolutely.

54:17.963 --> 54:21.297
- Have I kept you waiting?
- No, not at all.

54:21.422 --> 54:24.838
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

54:24.963 --> 54:27.838
You look just like your profile shot.

54:27.963 --> 54:30.713
- Only prettier.
- Thank you.

54:31.588 --> 54:35.880
- Maybe I shouldn't ask, but...
- No, please don't.

54:36.005 --> 54:38.922
No? Okay. But...

54:40.005 --> 54:44.463
- How's your wife doing?
- Oh, please don't ask.

54:45.630 --> 54:49.380
It's... It's not that... No.

54:49.505 --> 54:52.338
Can I ask why you don't have kids?

54:52.463 --> 54:55.505
No, it's... It's a bit...

54:55.630 --> 54:58.505
A bit difficult, because...

54:58.630 --> 55:04.463
The way things are with her right now,
I don't think it's possible.

55:04.588 --> 55:07.838
But you want children, right?

55:07.963 --> 55:10.963
I can't think about myself right now.

55:11.088 --> 55:13.797
But I wonder...

55:13.922 --> 55:17.338
If that's how it is, maybe you must?

55:17.463 --> 55:19.922
Or what?

55:23.047 --> 55:26.672
Elin? Elin!

55:30.255 --> 55:32.838
- Are you okay?
- What am I doing?

55:32.963 --> 55:37.588
- What happened?
- Sorry. I just have to fix this.

55:37.713 --> 55:40.630
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

55:54.797 --> 55:58.505
- Did the lights just go out?
- No. You need help?

55:58.630 --> 56:02.713
No thanks. I'll be okay, but...
Maybe a little help.

56:05.005 --> 56:08.338
- Hi.
- That wine went to my head.

56:08.463 --> 56:12.672
- I'm cheap that way.
- Did you manage to save the dress?

56:12.797 --> 56:15.130
Yes, it went fine.

56:21.755 --> 56:27.755
So what have you told your wife
you're doing this evening?

56:31.005 --> 56:34.255
Well, I said I'm going to the gym.

56:34.380 --> 56:38.755
- Hi! Anything for dessert?
- Yes, that sounds wonderful.

56:45.922 --> 56:48.005
Right.

56:50.380 --> 56:52.463
Thanks.

56:56.005 --> 57:00.630
I saw earlier you had apple tart
on the menu. I'll have that.

57:02.755 --> 57:05.422
Thanks. Right.

57:05.547 --> 57:08.338
What are you having?

57:08.463 --> 57:10.463
Uh...

57:10.588 --> 57:14.547
Yeah, I'll have apple tart as well.

57:24.005 --> 57:28.297
Elin?
Your eyesight isn't too good, is it?

57:29.463 --> 57:32.047
You can hardly see anything.

57:32.172 --> 57:35.588
- Maybe nothing at all?
- No. Oh dear.

57:35.713 --> 57:40.630
Boy, do I feel stupid now! Jeez.
No, I can't see anything.

57:40.755 --> 57:46.463
And I should have said so right away,
but we were having such a nice time.

57:47.422 --> 57:50.047
Nobody's pulling my leg?

57:50.172 --> 57:52.255
What do you mean?

58:01.630 --> 58:03.630
What?

58:03.755 --> 58:06.172
No, forget about it.

58:10.422 --> 58:15.380
Have you had problems
with your eyesight for long?

58:15.505 --> 58:18.797
No, it's happened once before, when...

58:18.922 --> 58:22.713
When... When... When...

58:34.880 --> 58:39.755
-"No, not that long..."
- Not that long. Just a couple of years.

58:41.838 --> 58:45.672
May I ask how... how it happened?

58:47.213 --> 58:49.213
Yes, of course.

58:49.338 --> 58:53.672
It was when... I was... I mean...

59:28.338 --> 59:33.255
It was a couple of years ago.
I got hit by ice falling from a roof.

59:33.380 --> 59:37.338
How can they let the sidewalks
be that dangerous in winter?

59:37.463 --> 59:41.463
They force us to be healthy.
Limit smoking and drinking.

59:41.588 --> 59:47.588
Then you go for a walk, non-smoking,
sober, and get hit by a chunk of ice.

59:49.422 --> 59:52.338
Yeah, that's...

59:53.505 --> 59:56.297
What happened to the apple tart?

1:00:09.047 --> 1:00:12.172
- You can't even see this?
- What?

1:00:12.297 --> 1:00:14.713
- The light?
- No.

1:00:21.297 --> 1:00:23.380
Is the light off or on?

1:00:23.505 --> 1:00:25.922
Is it off or on?

1:00:26.047 --> 1:00:28.130
It's off.

1:00:30.672 --> 1:00:33.297
Wait.

1:00:33.422 --> 1:00:37.713
You wouldn't do this if
it didn't mean anything to you?

1:02:25.338 --> 1:02:27.422
<i>I should delete it.</i>

1:02:27.547 --> 1:02:29.838
<i>He'd be shocked.</i>

1:02:34.713 --> 1:02:37.963
<i>Or maybe he'd think
it should be published.</i>

1:02:38.088 --> 1:02:41.547
<i>No matter how incoherent
and filthy it is.</i>

1:02:42.755 --> 1:02:48.380
<i>A blind author. That would
make everything okay again.</i>

1:02:48.505 --> 1:02:54.213
<i>Like the poor Frenchman who had
to blink an entire book to reclaim -</i>

1:02:54.338 --> 1:02:58.797
<i>- the status he'd had
as a fashion editor.</i>

1:03:20.005 --> 1:03:23.588
Here. I'll put it on the nightstand.

1:03:23.713 --> 1:03:26.130
Here's a glass of water.

1:03:27.713 --> 1:03:31.797
Sorry I was late last night.
So much to do before tonight.

1:03:31.922 --> 1:03:35.255
I'll never badmouth party fixers again.

1:03:37.338 --> 1:03:40.588
Have you made that playlist?

1:03:40.713 --> 1:03:42.672
Hey?

1:03:43.672 --> 1:03:45.755
Come here.

1:03:49.047 --> 1:03:51.130
What is it?

1:03:56.047 --> 1:04:00.630
I'm sure there's lots of people
you'll have to talk to tonight.

1:04:00.755 --> 1:04:02.922
I should just stay here.

1:04:07.130 --> 1:04:09.547
So many people, and I...

1:04:16.088 --> 1:04:18.172
I'm not ready yet.

1:04:21.338 --> 1:04:26.005
We'll go there together, like we said.
It'll be okay.

1:04:30.547 --> 1:04:33.505
You don't have to stay long.

1:05:19.588 --> 1:05:22.005
Ouch! Oh...

1:05:33.380 --> 1:05:37.630
Sorry. I was just checking the mail.

1:05:37.755 --> 1:05:41.088
So you've gone blind?

1:05:41.213 --> 1:05:43.672
Yeah, I guess so.

1:05:43.797 --> 1:05:47.838
It happened quite suddenly, I...

1:05:47.963 --> 1:05:51.755
- A chunk of ice fell from a roof.
- Right, but...

1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:54.172
- It happens.
- Yeah.

1:05:58.505 --> 1:06:01.172
- Have we met before?
- No.

1:06:01.297 --> 1:06:05.255
No, not really.
I live here as well.

1:06:06.588 --> 1:06:10.963
- I have to get going. Excuse me.
- Sure. See you.

1:06:11.088 --> 1:06:13.172
Bye.

1:07:15.963 --> 1:07:18.297
Kim? Kim?

1:07:18.422 --> 1:07:20.505
Kim!

1:07:33.797 --> 1:07:38.172
<i>One unread message.
Text message from Morten.</i>

1:07:39.255 --> 1:07:42.755
<i>I can't talk.
The big party tonight.</i>

1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:45.797
<i>Way too much to do.
I'll be in touch.</i>

1:07:47.630 --> 1:07:51.838
<i>Answer via text message to Morten.</i>

1:07:51.963 --> 1:07:55.505
<i>It's important.</i>

1:07:56.213 --> 1:08:00.255
<i>Something's happened.</i>

1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:03.922
<i>Send. Message sent.</i>

1:08:12.255 --> 1:08:16.213
<i>One unread message.
Text message from Morten.</i>

1:08:16.338 --> 1:08:19.963
<i>Please stop nagging.
Take a hint.</i>

1:08:20.088 --> 1:08:23.505
<i>It was good to know you.
Have a nice life.</i>

1:08:24.588 --> 1:08:28.297
<i>Reply via text message to Morten.</i>

1:08:28.422 --> 1:08:31.172
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1:08:31.297 --> 1:08:34.172
<i>You idiot.</i>

1:08:34.297 --> 1:08:38.463
<i>Coming to the party.</i>

1:08:39.713 --> 1:08:41.797
<i>Send.</i>

1:08:44.172 --> 1:08:46.255
<i>Cancel.</i>

1:08:47.380 --> 1:08:49.463
<i>Delete message.</i>

1:08:49.588 --> 1:08:51.588
<i>Deleted.</i>

1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:04.880
- Oh. Wow!
- Is it nice?

1:09:05.005 --> 1:09:08.713
- He'll think you're beautiful.
- Not too short?

1:09:08.838 --> 1:09:11.130
No, it's really nice, mom.

1:09:11.255 --> 1:09:16.088
It's really nice. It's really you.
Your mom looks great.

1:09:21.297 --> 1:09:26.255
- You're not putting on too much?
- No, it's like you wanted.

1:09:27.005 --> 1:09:29.088
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:34.005
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi.

1:09:54.213 --> 1:09:56.213
Hello!

1:09:56.338 --> 1:09:58.422
Are you ready?

1:10:11.130 --> 1:10:14.797
Hey? I don't think I can...

1:10:14.922 --> 1:10:19.338
I bumped into the doorframe.
My face must be bruised.

1:10:19.463 --> 1:10:23.380
- Are you okay?
- Does it look bad?

1:10:23.505 --> 1:10:26.838
No, I can't see anything.

1:10:31.380 --> 1:10:34.630
We only have about twenty minutes.

1:10:36.047 --> 1:10:38.297
I won't have time.

1:10:39.547 --> 1:10:45.755
- Okay. How much time do you need?
- No, I don't have anything to wear.

1:10:58.047 --> 1:11:00.838
- What's that?
- A new dress.

1:11:07.297 --> 1:11:09.963
Well, try it on.

1:11:13.797 --> 1:11:16.255
How does it look?

1:11:16.380 --> 1:11:18.588
Stunning.

1:11:18.713 --> 1:11:22.505
- Yes, but how?
- You look sexy.

1:11:22.630 --> 1:11:26.797
- But in a decent way, you know?
- No.

1:11:27.630 --> 1:11:30.838
The salesperson called it a classic.

1:11:30.963 --> 1:11:34.172
So the girl who sold it
to you liked it?

1:11:34.297 --> 1:11:37.172
You look great. Stunning.

1:11:49.963 --> 1:11:52.047
What size is it?

1:11:54.713 --> 1:11:57.547
-36.
- Then it's too small.

1:11:57.672 --> 1:12:01.172
- No.
- You have to tell me if it's too tight.

1:12:01.297 --> 1:12:03.713
I could feel it immediately.

1:12:03.838 --> 1:12:08.172
Okay, take the green one.
You used to wear it all the time.

1:12:08.297 --> 1:12:11.755
It's too small as well.
I've gained weight.

1:12:13.172 --> 1:12:16.755
- Try it on. We'll see.
- There's no point.

1:12:19.755 --> 1:12:23.588
For my sake. You know
how important this is for me.

1:12:25.297 --> 1:12:27.463
Why?

1:12:30.338 --> 1:12:33.130
Can't you just let me stay here?

1:12:35.755 --> 1:12:39.130
- You said you'd go.
- No, I said I'd try.

1:12:44.213 --> 1:12:46.713
- And now you've tried?
- Yeah.

1:13:03.672 --> 1:13:06.880
I know this is difficult for you, but...

1:13:07.005 --> 1:13:10.797
You know you can't go on like this.

1:13:12.338 --> 1:13:15.672
Just staying in here.

1:13:15.797 --> 1:13:19.672
If you're not even going to try, -

1:13:19.797 --> 1:13:22.922
- I don't know if
I can take it anymore.

1:13:25.838 --> 1:13:28.630
I thought you were in a hurry.

1:13:58.505 --> 1:14:01.255
<i>Watching TV is much like before.</i>

1:14:01.380 --> 1:14:06.797
<i>It's easy to imagine what's happening.
How unnecessary the pictures are.</i>

1:14:13.797 --> 1:14:17.255
<i>A sharp increase in theft in Oslo...</i>

1:15:03.422 --> 1:15:05.588
Hi! You must be Ingrid.

1:15:05.713 --> 1:15:09.297
I'm Bente.
Morten said you weren't coming.

1:15:09.422 --> 1:15:14.130
- Is Morten here?
- Yes, he's around here somewhere.

1:15:14.255 --> 1:15:16.338
Let me take your coat.

1:15:31.505 --> 1:15:33.547
I think I can see him.

1:15:33.672 --> 1:15:37.213
- Just wait here a moment.
- But...

1:15:51.963 --> 1:15:56.255
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
a pregnant blind woman.</i>

1:15:56.380 --> 1:15:59.588
<i>Blind mothers have to
pull their pram, -</i>

1:15:59.713 --> 1:16:05.047
<i>- to avoid pushing it into the unknown.
You'd remember seeing that.</i>

1:16:05.172 --> 1:16:10.297
<i>A blind mother dragging a baby carriage
behind her, white cane in hand.</i>

1:16:16.588 --> 1:16:21.172
<i>A colleague of Morten once asked
provocatively if we'd ever seen -</i>

1:16:21.297 --> 1:16:24.130
<i>- a black man cycling?
We couldn't remember.</i>

1:16:24.255 --> 1:16:29.422
<i>Everyone laughed. Ove-Kenneth had seen
Samuel I. Jackson cycling in a movie.</i>

1:16:29.547 --> 1:16:34.880
<i>Morten exclaimed, "Special effects!"
And we all laughed even more.</i>

1:16:35.005 --> 1:16:39.130
<i>I like it when he's cheeky.
He's so cautious now.</i>

1:16:39.255 --> 1:16:42.380
<i>Maybe because I've joined a minority, -</i>

1:16:42.505 --> 1:16:46.255
<i>- he treats minorities
with exaggerated respect.</i>

1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:58.172
Here's the old office building.
We let it stand so that...

1:16:58.297 --> 1:17:02.797
Morten? Morten?

1:17:02.922 --> 1:17:07.088
- Are you Ingrid?
- Do you know where Morten is?

1:17:07.213 --> 1:17:12.630
Ove-Kenneth has a room up here
he uses when he has to work overtime.

1:17:12.755 --> 1:17:16.297
- Shall I accompany you?
- No, I'm okay.

1:17:16.422 --> 1:17:20.130
It's the first door to the left
at the top.

1:17:20.255 --> 1:17:22.880
Oops.

1:17:23.005 --> 1:17:26.463
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm okay. Thanks.

1:17:44.797 --> 1:17:46.880
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:17:51.130 --> 1:17:53.588
What are you doing here?

1:17:53.713 --> 1:17:58.797
- There's something I have to tell you.
- Right.

1:18:01.297 --> 1:18:05.505
- It's important.
- I see. Okay.

1:18:08.297 --> 1:18:10.380
I'm pregnant.

1:18:15.463 --> 1:18:20.338
Are... Are you sure?
Have you taken a test?

1:18:20.463 --> 1:18:24.797
I can't see,
so I went to the doctor.

1:18:24.922 --> 1:18:29.047
- What did he say?
-"Congratulations."

1:18:29.172 --> 1:18:32.088
Careful. There.

1:18:48.338 --> 1:18:53.547
Sit down. Have you thought
about what you want to do?

1:18:55.713 --> 1:18:59.422
- I don't know.
- It's a bit of a shock for me.

1:18:59.547 --> 1:19:02.463
Obviously.

1:19:02.588 --> 1:19:07.338
But I'm there for you,
no matter what you decide.

1:19:07.463 --> 1:19:11.338
I'm glad to hear. Thank you.

1:19:11.463 --> 1:19:13.547
You've had children.

1:19:14.922 --> 1:19:18.255
They can be a handful,
even if you can see.

1:19:18.380 --> 1:19:20.797
What if something happens?

1:19:20.922 --> 1:19:27.088
It's a hereditary disease. You want
your child to risk going through this?

1:19:28.463 --> 1:19:32.047
Hereditary?
A chunk of ice fell on my head.

1:19:32.172 --> 1:19:34.463
No, I mean...

1:19:34.588 --> 1:19:39.380
Have you thought it through?
You'll never see what it looks like.

1:19:39.505 --> 1:19:42.463
Never see it grow.
Never see it smile.

1:19:42.588 --> 1:19:45.172
Have you thought about that?

1:19:53.088 --> 1:19:55.297
Hey...

1:19:55.422 --> 1:19:58.213
It's just me. No, wait.

1:19:58.338 --> 1:20:00.380
Hey, wait.

1:20:00.505 --> 1:20:03.047
- Please...
- Oh!

1:20:03.172 --> 1:20:06.213
You think I want your child?
You bore me!

1:20:06.338 --> 1:20:10.463
Why did I marry you anyway?
Why did I do it?

1:20:11.713 --> 1:20:14.338
What is all this?

1:20:14.463 --> 1:20:17.505
Do you think I'm into this crap?

1:20:17.630 --> 1:20:20.630
- No, you're too boring.
- Boring?

1:20:20.755 --> 1:20:25.963
Is it boring not to snort coke
and have sex with...

1:20:27.047 --> 1:20:29.922
- With...
- With what?

1:20:30.047 --> 1:20:33.255
Damned if I know.
<i>You</i> made it up.

1:20:33.380 --> 1:20:36.297
What sort of immature crap is this?

1:20:40.505 --> 1:20:45.922
Why must everything be so over the top?
Sexualised? Is this who you are?

1:20:50.047 --> 1:20:53.297
And why are you so mean to her?

1:21:00.630 --> 1:21:05.255
Excuse me.
Seems you two have a lot to talk about.

1:21:05.380 --> 1:21:11.588
Why do you have to drag us into this?
Ove-Kenneth is the world's nicest guy.

1:21:11.713 --> 1:21:15.880
And why would I ruin everything
for Elin and... and...?

1:21:17.297 --> 1:21:19.005
Einar.

1:21:20.963 --> 1:21:25.838
- Why not just let them get together?
- That guy? With her?

1:21:25.963 --> 1:21:30.338
Why not? Good things can also
happen to people, you know.

1:21:30.463 --> 1:21:34.213
- Let them get together.
- I'm just having fun.

1:21:34.338 --> 1:21:38.755
Is it fun imagining that I date
other women? Is that it?

1:21:39.547 --> 1:21:44.213
You want me to find a nice girl
like Elin? Is that what you want?

1:21:44.338 --> 1:21:47.838
- Is that what <i>you</i> want?
- No.

1:21:49.713 --> 1:21:55.338
Nobody wants to be with someone
who has issues. Not in the long run.

1:21:55.797 --> 1:21:59.047
Come and sit down.

1:22:02.463 --> 1:22:06.463
Do you really think
I'd bring anyone else here?

1:22:11.338 --> 1:22:13.838
I love you. You know that?

1:22:16.005 --> 1:22:18.422
But look at yourself.

1:22:35.047 --> 1:22:40.380
- Why haven't you bought more wine?
- You mustn't drink if you're pregnant.

1:22:46.130 --> 1:22:48.505
Why won't you tell me?

1:22:51.797 --> 1:22:53.463
I'm not sure I'm...

1:22:55.630 --> 1:22:57.630
You want me to be?

1:22:59.797 --> 1:23:02.963
You can't go on like this, you know.

1:23:06.630 --> 1:23:10.088
Is that what you're going
to tell people?

1:23:10.213 --> 1:23:15.797
That it wasn't because I went blind,
that's not why it didn't work out?

1:23:25.463 --> 1:23:27.630
Morten?

1:23:30.755 --> 1:23:33.005
Morten?

1:23:36.505 --> 1:23:38.922
Morten!

1:24:08.672 --> 1:24:12.380
Are you okay? Let me help you.

1:24:21.047 --> 1:24:23.422
Mind the steps.

1:25:29.380 --> 1:25:32.505
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

1:25:32.630 --> 1:25:36.297
Do you know if there's
a pharmacy nearby?

1:25:36.422 --> 1:25:40.922
Sure, there's one...
If you go down there to the left...

1:25:41.047 --> 1:25:45.547
I mean...
In the direction you were heading.

1:25:45.672 --> 1:25:50.130
There's a curb along there.
Just follow it down the footpath.

1:25:50.255 --> 1:25:54.463
You'll reach a road,
then it's to the right.

1:25:54.588 --> 1:25:57.797
- Okay? You got it?
- Yes. Thank you.

1:25:58.338 --> 1:26:00.297
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:27:45.297 --> 1:27:47.713
Are you looking at it?

1:27:50.005 --> 1:27:52.088
Yeah.

1:27:53.213 --> 1:27:55.422
What does it say?

1:27:58.755 --> 1:28:03.297
- I don't understand.
- It's not that difficult.

1:28:03.422 --> 1:28:05.755
Are there two red lines?

1:28:07.922 --> 1:28:12.297
- Or not?
- Well, there are, but...

1:28:14.630 --> 1:28:16.713
- There are?
- Yeah.

1:28:19.672 --> 1:28:24.047
Does that mean that...
you're pregnant?

1:28:24.130 --> 1:28:26.213
Yeah.

1:28:27.630 --> 1:28:29.713
It does.

1:28:36.588 --> 1:28:39.130
So what do you think?

1:28:58.922 --> 1:29:02.880
Mommy? Someone's staring at us.

1:29:03.630 --> 1:29:06.213
What does he look like?

1:29:06.338 --> 1:29:10.630
He... He's ugly, and has a ponytail.

1:29:11.922 --> 1:29:15.713
Don't be afraid. He's nice.
He helps me sometimes.

1:29:17.463 --> 1:29:20.797
Am I looking at him now?

1:29:20.922 --> 1:29:23.005
A bit up.

1:29:24.922 --> 1:29:28.088
- What's he doing?
- He's waving back.

1:29:30.088 --> 1:29:32.713
He looks really shy.

1:29:43.963 --> 1:29:46.422
<i>He'll probably try again.</i>

1:29:46.547 --> 1:29:51.005
<i>Slip inside.
Sit down and watch.</i>

1:29:51.130 --> 1:29:55.838
<i>Specially now, when I'm not
the only one to worry about.</i>

1:29:55.963 --> 1:30:00.005
<i>Now that we're expecting
a child and everything.</i>

1:30:00.130 --> 1:30:03.047
<i>I'll just have to sit still.</i>

1:30:03.172 --> 1:30:06.047
<i>Wait until he feels safe.</i>

1:30:06.172 --> 1:30:10.338
<i>Then I'll get up and walk,
not straight toward him, -</i>

1:30:10.463 --> 1:30:13.380
<i>- but toward his part of the room.</i>

1:30:16.088 --> 1:30:21.672
<i>As soon as I feel the carpet
beneath my feet, I'll just lie down.</i>

1:30:21.797 --> 1:30:24.630
<i>Right in front of him.</i>

1:30:54.380 --> 1:30:57.088
<i>We'll make it work.</i>

1:30:57.213 --> 1:31:00.463
<i>He just has to stop
being so damn boring.</i>
