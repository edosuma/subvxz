WEBVTT

01:15.200 --> 01:17.202
Hey, we doing this together?

01:18.036 --> 01:21.540
I'll shout if I need you.
Just enjoy your breakfast.

01:22.124 --> 01:24.960
I'll tell you hands down
the best thing about this country.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.671
Whoever invented chocolate buttons
deserves a knighthood.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.631
Glad you found something to approve of.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.093
Can you at least tell me
how you're planning to approach him?

01:33.719 --> 01:36.305
I thought I might ask him
to tell the truth.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.973
Big word.

01:38.056 --> 01:42.269
Too big for Katherine Newman obviously.
"Tell the truth" is everywhere.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.855
People are starting to wonder
why she hasn't commented.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.191
Only people who don't know
it's standard procedure for us

01:47.274 --> 01:49.735
to advise a family of a hostage
not to say anything.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.653
I don't believe
she takes advice from anyone.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.948
Actually, in my experience,
the smartest people usually do.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.825
You still think this is
about the ambassadorship?

01:57.367 --> 01:58.785
Well, it makes sense.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.412
Look, in America,
people take it for granted

02:00.495 --> 02:02.247
that powerful people buy
presidential favor

02:02.331 --> 02:03.790
and get rewarded with top jobs.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.586
I guess plenty of other people
consider that corruption.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.169
But you don't think it is.

02:09.252 --> 02:10.964
You don't think the same happens here?

02:11.673 --> 02:14.426
You guys just had more time
to practice hiding things.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.642
-I'll be watching.
-Yep. I don't doubt it.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.701
Special Agent Neilssen hasn't called you?

03:20.784 --> 03:22.744
No. Is this about
the new guy they arrested?

03:22.828 --> 03:24.788
A student at Oxford. Eddie Walker?

03:26.582 --> 03:30.377
I only visited Leo in Oxford once.
Were they, like, friends?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.546
I was hoping you would be able to tell me.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.341
To be honest,
Leo never really talked about Oxford.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.510
No, I don't recognize him.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.971
-Matty?
-Sorry.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.433
He was at a bar near here
the night Leo was taken.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.727
Do you think he could have
met up with him after he left you?

03:46.810 --> 03:48.937
By the time we split, Leo was already--

03:49.021 --> 03:51.773
He was pretty lit.
I told him to take a cab, but--

03:51.857 --> 03:53.775
If he was planning on
meeting someone else,

03:53.859 --> 03:55.777
I'm pretty sure
he would've told one of us.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.322
If any of these people look
even vaguely familiar,

03:58.405 --> 04:01.033
there must be some link to Leo somewhere.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.829
You been online today?

04:05.913 --> 04:10.292
No. God knows who's monitoring
my Internet searches. Why?

04:11.043 --> 04:12.377
There's been another arrest.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.379
They announced it?

04:14.463 --> 04:17.298
No, but everyone on here is saying
he's a student at uni.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.136
-Ours?
-Eddie Walker?

04:22.304 --> 04:23.805
Do you know anyone who knows him?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.891
-Nope.
-Would you ask around?

04:26.892 --> 04:27.893
Here we are.

04:28.644 --> 04:29.853
Where exactly?

04:35.776 --> 04:36.944
What's going on?

04:38.987 --> 04:39.988
What are you up to?

04:40.656 --> 04:42.115
-You ready?
-Yeah.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.120
-Take those. Here you go.
-Thanks.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.627
-Okay?
-Feels good to be doing something.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.587
These things are everywhere online.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.674
The more pressure
we put Katherine Newman under,

04:59.174 --> 05:01.260
the faster she'll have to tell the truth.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.346
Then Leo will get released.
Your name will be in the clear.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.193
When you were approached
at the bar, you asked--

05:18.277 --> 05:21.488
I wouldn't say I was approached.
I'd say I was assaulted.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.949
You asked if it was about Leo Newman.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.410
-Why did you say that?
-Because I was there.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.036
Same place, same night.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.540
And it is about him,
so I've got nothing to hide.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.626
You were also
at the same university as Leo.

05:34.710 --> 05:35.794
That's quite a coincidence.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.713
I know. Freaky.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.174
Why were you in New York?

05:40.257 --> 05:44.386
Because I love it there.
I go as much as I can.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.554
Where did you stay?

05:46.471 --> 05:47.514
Nowhere.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.142
I didn't actually book anything.
I just know people.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.269
-Like Leo Newman.
-Nope.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.523
Why aren't you more frightened, Eddie?

05:56.607 --> 05:59.109
You've been arrested
in connection with a major crime,

05:59.193 --> 06:01.028
held in a cell overnight.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.654
Don't seem remotely fazed.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.908
Like I told you, I've got nothing to hide.
Why would I be fazed? But…

06:08.535 --> 06:09.995
for the record,

06:10.078 --> 06:11.914
I am pretty sweaty.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.667
Did you meet Leo at Oxford?

06:15.751 --> 06:17.961
No, I've never met Leo anywhere.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.466
Do you always hire a car in New York?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.259
No, actually, this was my first time.

06:24.343 --> 06:26.845
I was thinking about traveling.
Wanted to go to the coast.

06:27.679 --> 06:28.680
Why didn't you?

06:28.764 --> 06:30.432
-Honestly?
-Please, yeah.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.727
I really hated it.
Everyone was really rude,

06:33.810 --> 06:35.896
and they drive
on the wrong side of the road.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.814
And it's a miracle I got to Midtown.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.942
Yeah, I lost that thing
as soon as I could.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.445
Why an SUV?
Were you planning on having passengers?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.489
No, just thought it'd look cool.

06:47.658 --> 06:50.369
Did you visit a bar
near the Park Madison Hotel?

06:50.452 --> 06:51.662
Maybe.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.705
Your debit card was used there.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.124
So, what did you do after that?

06:56.208 --> 06:57.626
-After the bar?
-Yeah.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.920
I had sex.

07:00.629 --> 07:01.713
You had sex?

07:01.797 --> 07:02.798
Where?

07:03.882 --> 07:06.468
Against a wall, then in the bed,

07:06.552 --> 07:11.265
then a bit in the bathroom,
but by that point…

07:14.393 --> 07:15.894
Okay, I don't know.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.730
We met on the street,
somewhere around 50th and Broadway.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.607
Shared a, you know, smoke.

07:20.691 --> 07:21.984
Can you give me her name, please?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.068
No.

07:23.652 --> 07:27.614
Because it wasn't a "her,"
and also it never came up.

07:27.698 --> 07:28.699
Convenient.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.783
Not really,

07:30.409 --> 07:33.078
since it means I can't prove
that what I'm saying is true.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.832
I also can't remember
where this apartment was. Sorry.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.333
And you left there at what time?

07:38.417 --> 07:39.418
Early morning.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.297
Then you dropped the SUV
back at the airport rental garage

07:43.380 --> 07:44.882
9:30 Tuesday morning.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.593
I was pretty fucked. Slept the day at JFK.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.429
Caught an earlier flight back.
Flying visit.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.599
You don't seriously think
I've got anything to do with all of this?

07:54.349 --> 07:58.770
I'm actually thinking about
doing your job, when I grow up.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.399
Where are your parents
at the moment, Eddie?

08:05.360 --> 08:07.654
Mum's in France,
and Dad's in LA with his wife. Why?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.116
Just need to verify a few things.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.786
I'm over 18. It's up to me
who I tell about this, right?

08:16.788 --> 08:18.290
What are you going to tell them?

08:23.045 --> 08:24.046
What's gonna happen?

08:24.129 --> 08:27.674
We're going to let him go,
exactly the same as with the others.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.551
You're not serious.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.221
I've been here for three days.
All I've seen you do is release people.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.514
There's no point in holding him.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.307
The kid was just getting rattled.

08:35.933 --> 08:39.811
Sometimes you have to push a little.
Like, what is with you people?

08:39.895 --> 08:43.857
Is it, like, bad manners to hold suspects
for more than five minutes?

08:43.941 --> 08:45.317
He'll be kept under surveillance.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.486
Yeah.
What has surveillance gotten us so far?

08:48.111 --> 08:49.571
A chance to arrest Sean Tilson today.

08:52.157 --> 08:56.203
Assuming he's not working with Thompson
and we're not getting taken for a ride.

08:57.496 --> 09:00.707
If it's Tilson, he has no idea she's here,
and he wants that money.

09:01.291 --> 09:05.254
We could have the key to the whole case
in the building by the end of the day.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.547
Let's focus on that.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.182
Mon.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.727
Hey.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.355
Mon, I know you can hear me.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.692
Come on, Monique, please. Look at me.

09:31.405 --> 09:36.326
Monique. Please.
I know you're angry with me. Mon.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.768
How much is it?

10:02.728 --> 10:04.521
I take from you. Yeah.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.287
Aadesh Chopra.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.457
No.

11:09.545 --> 11:11.255
Yes, it is.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.342
How did you find me?

11:15.425 --> 11:18.887
It's all over social media.
Someone filmed the police searching your--

11:18.971 --> 11:20.180
Have you been sleeping in here?

11:20.264 --> 11:21.265
No.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.976
You're not a very good liar, are you?

11:25.269 --> 11:26.270
Are you a journalist?

11:26.353 --> 11:29.857
No, dude, look at me. What happened?
Did you get kicked out of the house?

11:29.940 --> 11:30.941
Just leave me alone.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.569
No. Wait. Dude. I'm on your side.
Same thing happened to me.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.696
My name's Eddie Walker. Look.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.575
I'm that guy. That's me.

11:40.576 --> 11:45.455
That could be anyone. It's all pixelly.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.624
"Pixelly" is not a word.

11:47.708 --> 11:51.545
That is me. Look, same clothes.
Got arrested yesterday, questioned today.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.883
Wait. By who? American guy?

11:56.592 --> 11:59.011
Kept making noises like--

12:00.929 --> 12:03.223
No, it was a woman.
But it didn't make any sense.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.684
One minute it was the Spanish Inquisition,
the next they just let me go.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.895
-But she took my passport, my phone.
-Yeah. Yeah.

12:10.189 --> 12:11.398
Walker's with Chopra.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.697
Another coincidence, right?

12:19.781 --> 12:21.408
Surveillance gives us nothing, right?

12:22.534 --> 12:24.494
I'm on my last warning. No more allowance.

12:24.578 --> 12:25.787
My dad will have me working

12:25.871 --> 12:27.998
in one of his leisurewear stores
in Cali-fuckin-fornia.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.499
It's not a good look for me.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.298
So you didn't do it?

12:36.381 --> 12:38.634
No. Did you?

12:38.717 --> 12:39.718
No, man.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.512
Okay, just hear me out.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.475
All right, here's the thing, Aadesh.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.685
I don't know why,
but somebody's trying to set me up.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.396
-You too, maybe.
-Not maybe.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.233
Okay. Either way,
the police aren't just gonna let us go.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.110
So what can we do about it?

12:58.028 --> 12:59.238
Okay, so here's the thing.

12:59.321 --> 13:02.824
If we forget about the psycho dude
whose face is everywhere at the moment,

13:02.908 --> 13:05.410
which, on balance,
I think we probably should,

13:05.494 --> 13:07.162
then there's four of us, right?

13:07.663 --> 13:12.084
I say you and I find the other two,
and we go public together.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.962
We get our story out on every front page.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.256
Yeah, but what if
the other two did it though?

13:19.258 --> 13:21.760
I don't know.
But what I do know for certain is

13:21.844 --> 13:24.304
my parents are not gonna
take my word for it.

13:24.388 --> 13:26.723
And the only way
that you get back over there,

13:27.266 --> 13:30.269
back in that house,
is by proving your innocence.

13:32.729 --> 13:33.897
That and having a shower.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.570
Listen. That was a joke. That was a joke.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.970
You get him to the location.
We'll do the rest.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.310
He'll know it was me who set him up.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.770
He knows where I live.
He knows where my mum lives.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.189
But he'll be in custody.

14:15.272 --> 14:16.273
Forever?

14:16.356 --> 14:19.943
Excuse me. It seems
we're all forgetting something here.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.154
We have enough evidence

14:22.237 --> 14:25.282
to charge you with embezzlement,
fraud, money laundering--

14:25.365 --> 14:27.951
I had not forgotten,
but thank you for reminding me.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.329
Which means you're looking at jail time,

14:30.412 --> 14:34.082
a huge fine,
all of your assets being seized…

14:34.166 --> 14:36.084
Yes. That was sarcasm. I get it.

14:36.168 --> 14:39.796
…unless, Natalie, you're smart.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.926
Help us now,
and some of those charges just go away.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.553
So the question is,

14:46.637 --> 14:49.431
how badly do you really want
to protect your family?

15:14.790 --> 15:15.791
Ask him where.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.226
I need to update New York.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.069
They let Walker go too?

15:45.237 --> 15:47.698
Do we think the Brits have
any idea what they're doing?

15:48.198 --> 15:50.409
He also said
they're bringing in Tilson today.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.785
-Are they sure it's him?
-No.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.495
They're setting up an operation right now.

15:53.579 --> 15:55.330
Okay, good. What are legal saying?

15:55.414 --> 15:59.918
Same as the FBI. Say nothing.
The whole world is talking about it.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.130
And the narrative's being shaped
by whoever took Leo,

16:03.213 --> 16:05.507
and we're just watching it happen.

16:06.425 --> 16:08.510
If we were clients,
it's the advice we'd give.

16:08.594 --> 16:12.556
Play it long.
Stay quiet until there's no other option.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.016
First page in the playbook.

16:14.099 --> 16:18.937
Right. Except I don't remember the chapter
on kidnap of your only child.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.530
You should go home today.

16:29.740 --> 16:30.991
See Angie and the kids.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.160
I'm not leaving here until you do.

16:36.872 --> 16:38.916
Let's just hope they get Tilson, huh?

16:44.004 --> 16:47.007
Sean Tilson, military-trained,

16:47.090 --> 16:50.511
knows about firearms and explosives
and will kill without hesitation.

16:50.594 --> 16:53.388
He'll also smell a trap from a mile away.

16:53.472 --> 16:56.308
Our advance surveillance team are
on their way to cover the area.

16:56.391 --> 17:00.646
We have operatives embedded
in the surrounding area, and snipers here,

17:01.396 --> 17:03.148
here and here.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.778
Anyone got any questions so far? Okay.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.451
You sure about sending Thompson
out there alone?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.287
There'll be an armed MAST team
behind the surveillance team.

17:17.371 --> 17:20.123
As soon as we get a positive ID on Tilson,
they move in.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.541
-Contingency?
-We need him alive, sir.

17:23.252 --> 17:25.963
But obviously our priority's
making sure Natalie's safe.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.006
If we need to take critical action,
we will.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.593
-Very good.
-Okay.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.011
Thank you, sir.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.025
You'll be fitted
with an earpiece and a hidden mic,

17:47.109 --> 17:49.278
so you'll be able
to talk to us throughout.

17:50.279 --> 17:51.572
And what do I say to him?

17:51.655 --> 17:55.576
Nothing. You get out of the car.
You hand over the money. That's our cue.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.084
And what if something goes wrong?

18:04.168 --> 18:06.378
Do exactly as we tell you,
and you'll be fine.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.055
I'm telling you, man,
when they bring us in,

18:17.139 --> 18:19.766
it won't be for questioning.
They're gonna put us on a flight.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.143
You're being paranoid.

18:21.226 --> 18:22.811
That's kidnapping, mate.
We're British citizens.

18:22.895 --> 18:24.855
Do you know who Leo Newman's mum is?

18:25.439 --> 18:27.900
People like that,
they do whatever the fuck they want.

18:27.983 --> 18:31.320
And I wouldn't want to be
your shade of white in America,

18:31.987 --> 18:36.491
or as pretty as I am in one of
their jails. I'm not gonna be a patsy.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.744
-A what?
-It doesn't matter.

18:38.827 --> 18:39.828
Why aren't we driving?

18:39.912 --> 18:42.539
Because it makes it easier for them
to follow us. I've seen it on TV.

18:42.623 --> 18:45.125
Don't know what I'm more scared of,
the police or you.

18:45.209 --> 18:46.293
Me?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.963
Twenty meters behind us is
a guy in a white T-shirt.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.048
Don't look.

18:51.715 --> 18:54.092
-What about him?
-He's been following us since we left.

18:55.844 --> 18:56.845
Yeah.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.353
Get down.

19:15.364 --> 19:16.365
Is he gone?

19:17.366 --> 19:18.992
-Yeah.
-Yeah, but they're not stupid.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.995
They'll switch now.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.249
Come on. Let's go.

19:34.550 --> 19:35.551
You okay?

19:37.344 --> 19:38.345
Really?

19:45.727 --> 19:46.812
Was it worth it?

19:48.188 --> 19:50.023
-What?
-Taking all that money?

19:52.067 --> 19:54.027
I told you. It wasn't for me.

19:57.406 --> 19:58.407
What?

19:58.949 --> 20:01.827
Monique's college cost
a lot less than what you stole.

20:05.497 --> 20:08.917
So it meant I could help Mum
if she needed it.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.753
And plan the wedding I always wanted.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.424
What I did is nothing

20:15.507 --> 20:19.344
compared to what people with real money
get away with every single day.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.973
Yeah, I get that.

20:25.184 --> 20:28.604
And I get how frustrating it is
watching more privileged people succeed

20:28.687 --> 20:32.858
even though they're less capable
than people like Monique, or you.

20:33.358 --> 20:34.359
Or you.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.868
I think maybe part of what you did was
just a massive "fuck you."

20:46.997 --> 20:48.373
Maybe.

20:54.004 --> 20:56.340
Maybe kidnapping Leo Newman is too.

21:04.598 --> 21:05.766
Thank you.

21:14.316 --> 21:18.237
Okay. Follow the road
for two miles in that direction.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.657
I'll be talking to you the whole time.
Red one's yours.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.117
Can I get one of these?

21:25.994 --> 21:27.412
We'll be right behind you.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.208
Incoming from Tilson.

21:37.381 --> 21:39.049
He's changed location.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.133
To where?

21:40.717 --> 21:42.010
Three miles east.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.513
Sending it through now.

21:45.931 --> 21:47.099
Do we push back?

21:47.182 --> 21:48.684
No way. He'll smell it.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.018
There's no time to move the team.

21:50.102 --> 21:52.938
Look, as long as we get
a couple of snipers in place-- Look.

21:53.021 --> 21:55.858
There's water all along here.
He'll be trapped.

21:57.109 --> 21:58.610
She'll also be a sitting target.

22:00.571 --> 22:01.572
What are they saying?

22:04.157 --> 22:06.368
-I'll go with her.
-What?

22:06.451 --> 22:08.370
You okay to take over as lead, sir?

22:09.454 --> 22:11.540
Fine. But first sign you're compromised,

22:11.623 --> 22:12.791
I call this off.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.459
What's happening?

22:15.294 --> 22:16.295
Let's go.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.759
-I need a firearm.
-Yes, ma'am.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.516
You okay?

22:30.726 --> 22:32.853
Never been better. You?

22:33.729 --> 22:34.730
Same.

22:36.190 --> 22:38.525
From Gold, all stinger units to redeploy

22:38.609 --> 22:40.527
to new plot 2 outer quarter coordinates.

22:40.611 --> 22:41.612
Good.

23:05.594 --> 23:06.887
Are you ready to do this?

23:09.181 --> 23:10.557
I just want it to be over.

23:11.892 --> 23:12.893
You'll be okay.

23:26.114 --> 23:27.991
I think we should be there.

23:49.388 --> 23:52.975
This is Bravo One. Are units in position?

23:54.226 --> 23:56.770
Stand by. Moving into position now.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.818
Video transmission activated.

24:06.321 --> 24:07.322
We have visual.

24:09.825 --> 24:12.536
-What do I do? Do I get out?
-Not until I say.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.871
Stop talking now.

24:27.384 --> 24:30.220
-He's not coming, is he?
-I said no more talking.

24:37.561 --> 24:39.646
Motorcyclist riding towards Charlie One.

24:40.606 --> 24:41.773
Shit.

24:44.860 --> 24:46.486
Son of a bitch is on a bike.

24:47.946 --> 24:50.699
-If anything happens to me--
-I said stop talking.

24:55.370 --> 24:59.291
OP One, subject rider is at stop,
stop, stop adjacent Charlie One.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.210
No change, no change.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.587
Can you identify it is Tango One?

25:03.670 --> 25:06.673
OP One, no, no. Zero visual due to helmet.

25:08.967 --> 25:11.053
All units in position. Go.

25:11.136 --> 25:12.888
Okay, Natalie. Go.

25:13.472 --> 25:16.183
Control to all units. We are go on…

25:18.393 --> 25:19.561
Come on.

25:19.645 --> 25:25.025
Natalie, all you have to do is
get out of the car, give him the envelope,

25:25.108 --> 25:26.652
and then it's over.

25:26.735 --> 25:29.196
No change, no change.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.198
Do it, Natalie. Do it now.

25:32.157 --> 25:34.117
I have no visual yet.

25:37.579 --> 25:41.458
From OP One, Victor One is out,
out, out of the vehicle with package.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.877
Still no confirmation ID
of subject motorcyclist.

25:43.961 --> 25:47.130
I repeat, no confirmation of ID. Over.

25:47.214 --> 25:50.133
OP One,
Victor One is approaching motorcyclist.

25:50.217 --> 25:54.179
Five mike. Four, three, two, one.

25:54.763 --> 25:56.890
OP One, I have
no clear visual of the subject.

25:56.974 --> 26:00.811
Victor One is blocking my shot.
I repeat, Victor One is blocking my shot.

26:02.688 --> 26:04.606
From Gold, OP One, you are amber.

26:04.690 --> 26:07.985
I repeat, amber.
Lethal force not authorized.

26:11.154 --> 26:13.657
-Victor One is down.
-From Gold, strike, strike.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.826
Lethal force is authorized.

26:29.715 --> 26:32.009
Natalie. Natalie.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.607
We've lost eyes on Tilson.

26:46.690 --> 26:49.651
All units, you are free to engage.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.091
Shit. The tracker's burned.

27:37.366 --> 27:38.909
Go! Go! Go!

28:07.980 --> 28:09.523
Lost, lost, lost.

28:09.606 --> 28:10.774
Fuck!

28:27.457 --> 28:29.793
You're all right. You're okay.

28:29.877 --> 28:31.795
You're okay.
You're winded, but you're okay.

28:32.421 --> 28:37.050
All right. You're okay. Okay.

28:39.178 --> 28:40.262
Did you get him?

28:43.432 --> 28:45.058
-Come on, miss.
-Got her?

28:45.809 --> 28:48.896
Natalie, take it easy.
You feel good. Just relax now.

28:50.314 --> 28:51.899
Take it easy. Take it easy.

28:54.902 --> 28:56.111
I--

28:58.822 --> 29:00.157
I don't know what to say.

29:03.410 --> 29:04.411
I'm sorry.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.623
You lost him. That's all there is to say.

29:10.918 --> 29:12.002
We'll find him.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.463
We both know you've said that before.

29:33.357 --> 29:36.443
Alice. Hi.
Did we have a meeting scheduled?

29:36.527 --> 29:38.111
The board asked me to stop by.

29:38.195 --> 29:39.696
It seems there's some concern.

29:39.780 --> 29:41.615
About Leo or the stock price?

29:42.324 --> 29:46.328
Katherine, you asked me to join this board
to offer strategic advice.

29:46.411 --> 29:49.206
Is that what I said? What I thought was,

29:49.289 --> 29:52.835
as a former CIA agent
and national security adviser,

29:52.918 --> 29:55.796
your network would be useful in a crisis.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.464
And you're right on time.

29:57.548 --> 30:00.259
The UK police just lost Sean Tilson.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.973
I'm still making inquiries.

30:06.056 --> 30:08.934
These guys aren't behaving
like a typical terrorist organization.

30:09.017 --> 30:12.145
Aren't they? You look pretty terrified.

30:12.229 --> 30:14.606
Have you looked online
since they dropped that logo?

30:14.690 --> 30:17.276
Terrorist groups are using
more sophisticated messaging

30:17.359 --> 30:18.986
than the best comms agencies.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.070
This is my point.

30:20.153 --> 30:23.615
We need to consider the possibility
that this is only the start.

30:23.699 --> 30:27.077
No, this ends today.

30:28.287 --> 30:30.789
The FBI had their play. Now it's up to us.

30:31.748 --> 30:32.916
What are you thinking?

30:33.000 --> 30:36.587
We put out a statement, live from here.

30:36.670 --> 30:38.547
Saying what exactly?

30:44.636 --> 30:45.637
We have to talk.

30:46.597 --> 30:49.099
Natalie will be fine.
She's in shock but otherwise unhurt.

30:49.183 --> 30:51.560
This thing has had
no direction from the beginning.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.897
-I'm fine too. Thank you for your concern.
-I have kept my mouth shut so far.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.273
Have you?

30:56.356 --> 30:57.941
But Tilson will be trying
to leave the country.

30:58.025 --> 31:00.611
And if he makes it, we lose him for good.

31:00.694 --> 31:01.737
And maybe Leo too.

31:02.988 --> 31:05.032
Look, you need
to pull the surveillance off of the others

31:05.115 --> 31:06.825
and put everything you have on Tilson.

31:06.909 --> 31:07.910
No.

31:09.369 --> 31:12.164
He knows that Thompson is with us now.
He has no reason to stick around.

31:12.247 --> 31:13.832
What about Chopra and Walker?
They're together.

31:13.916 --> 31:16.376
So you think we can't bring them in
in a heartbeat if we need to?

31:16.460 --> 31:17.461
And Natalie?

31:18.253 --> 31:20.297
You just said she's fine.
Charge her with fraud.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.257
Put her out on bail. I don't care.

31:22.341 --> 31:25.302
Tilson just tried to kill her.
What if he tries again?

31:25.969 --> 31:27.346
There is nothing in it for him.

31:28.472 --> 31:32.643
We failed her today.
I won't do that again. The answer is no.

32:03.966 --> 32:06.593
Look up. There.

32:31.326 --> 32:33.912
-Sorry.
-For the climb?

32:33.996 --> 32:36.915
The call. I had no choice.

32:37.708 --> 32:38.792
That's not true.

32:39.376 --> 32:43.046
You were told to leave,
not chase around looking for money.

32:43.130 --> 32:46.133
-You know we don't like surprises.
-I don't love them much myself.

32:46.884 --> 32:51.305
But as you know, in my line of work,
your face on TV spells retirement.

32:51.889 --> 32:53.056
Yeah.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.600
New lives are expensive.

32:55.767 --> 32:57.227
But I've never let you down.

33:03.108 --> 33:04.193
So, what's in there?

33:04.276 --> 33:06.904
Everything you need to disappear forever.

35:02.853 --> 35:04.146
You know what this will mean?

35:04.229 --> 35:05.939
That I get Leo back, I hope.

35:07.816 --> 35:09.735
You want to deliver this thing yourself?

35:09.818 --> 35:11.570
No, but I'll write it.

35:12.738 --> 35:16.867
Wait. If you're serious about this
in terms of public sympathy,

35:16.950 --> 35:19.703
as Leo's mother,
you have to be the one to--

35:19.786 --> 35:22.456
Nobody buys me as a mother, Alice.

35:22.539 --> 35:25.501
Nobody buys
that I arranged 22 birthday parties

35:25.584 --> 35:27.753
and worried that no one would show up
to a single one.

35:27.836 --> 35:29.880
I know how my image plays.

35:29.963 --> 35:34.635
I'll always be a CEO first
and a mother second, if at all.

35:34.718 --> 35:37.721
Okay. So, we need a spokesperson.

35:38.514 --> 35:39.515
Somebody maternal.

35:40.891 --> 35:44.728
Yeah. Yeah, it's called--

35:45.771 --> 35:48.148
Barbara, senior comms.

35:48.732 --> 35:51.735
Yeah, if you could just have a look at
these two accounts for me--

35:51.818 --> 35:54.029
I've gotta go. Okay.
Call you back. Thanks. Bye.

35:54.821 --> 35:55.822
Morning.

35:56.365 --> 35:57.491
Barbara,

35:58.075 --> 36:01.453
I hate that I don't already know this,
but do you have children?

36:01.537 --> 36:02.829
No.

36:04.957 --> 36:06.959
Doesn't matter.

36:07.042 --> 36:09.044
Less makeup, new glasses.

36:11.380 --> 36:12.381
It'll work.

36:13.674 --> 36:15.300
I hope to God you're right.

36:45.873 --> 36:47.708
This one's fine.

36:53.422 --> 36:55.716
Better. She okay?

36:55.799 --> 36:58.010
-She look okay?
-She looks petrified.

36:58.093 --> 36:59.761
We have a little time
to rehearse with her.

36:59.845 --> 37:02.389
No, petrified is good. How's Alice?

37:02.472 --> 37:03.891
Also petrified.

37:03.974 --> 37:05.601
The truth does that to people.

37:06.310 --> 37:07.352
You sure about this?

37:08.937 --> 37:10.189
Thank you.

37:16.069 --> 37:19.781
I'm outside the Park Madison Hotel
in the heart of Midtown Manhattan,

37:19.865 --> 37:24.119
where the media is beginning to gather
to hear a statement from Katherine Newman,

37:24.203 --> 37:28.790
mother of kidnap victim Leo Newman,
and CEO of PR giant Cooper Newman.

37:28.874 --> 37:30.918
There is continued speculation

37:31.001 --> 37:33.420
about exactly what that statement
may reveal.

37:33.504 --> 37:38.050
Again, Miss Newman was instructed
to tell the truth by her son's kidnappers.

37:38.133 --> 37:41.553
But about what exactly?
We may be about to find out.

37:42.638 --> 37:44.014
-Hey.
-Sir.

37:44.097 --> 37:45.432
-Something happening?
-About to.

38:00.656 --> 38:04.576
I intend to read a short statement
on behalf of Katherine Newman

38:04.660 --> 38:05.994
and Cooper Newman PR.

38:06.078 --> 38:07.871
Why the hell didn't we know about this?

38:10.791 --> 38:13.877
"As you know, five days ago,

38:13.961 --> 38:18.799
my only child Leo was taken by force
from this hotel.

38:19.508 --> 38:24.221
And yesterday, his kidnappers demanded
that I tell the truth

38:24.304 --> 38:26.473
in order to secure his release.

38:27.182 --> 38:31.186
There has been speculation
about why I was the president's choice

38:31.270 --> 38:36.108
to represent the United States in the UK
as an official ambassador.

38:36.984 --> 38:40.821
I can confirm that my fundraising
on behalf of the president

38:40.904 --> 38:43.907
played a large part
in my securing the role.

38:45.033 --> 38:47.870
I've always been transparent about that.

38:48.704 --> 38:54.626
However, the time has come to disclose
the source of some of those funds.

38:56.587 --> 39:01.675
A significant part of my donation came
from the sale of a property in London.

39:02.384 --> 39:06.722
At the time, I didn't know
that the buyer had connections

39:06.805 --> 39:10.267
to the government of a country
under economic sanctions

39:10.350 --> 39:11.977
from the US Treasury Department.

39:13.812 --> 39:16.982
When that information did eventually come
to my attention,

39:17.065 --> 39:20.903
I should have informed
the relevant authorities immediately.

39:22.029 --> 39:23.655
I failed to do so.

39:24.615 --> 39:29.578
I can confirm, therefore,
that I have written to the president today

39:29.661 --> 39:34.374
to withdraw my name from consideration
for the ambassador's position.

39:35.083 --> 39:38.587
I relished the opportunity
to serve the country I love.

39:40.172 --> 39:45.344
However, the loss of Leo hurts far more

39:45.427 --> 39:48.055
than the loss of any job ever could.

39:49.181 --> 39:50.807
In the last few days,

39:50.891 --> 39:53.769
I've suffered as only a mother can.

39:55.395 --> 39:59.316
I've done what I was asked.
I've told the truth.

40:00.859 --> 40:04.279
Now, please, send Leo home to me.

40:05.697 --> 40:07.032
Thank you."

40:11.036 --> 40:14.665
Well, seems she's not smart enough
to take advice after all.

40:15.332 --> 40:16.542
Why would she?

40:17.125 --> 40:20.629
She's who we let down today.
Not Natalie fucking Thompson.

40:21.213 --> 40:23.841
There will be no questions
or further comment.

40:25.759 --> 40:28.345
Still not the truth, Katherine.

40:29.304 --> 40:32.724
Tell the truth
about what Eric Cresswell knows,

40:32.808 --> 40:36.311
or your son dies with the world watching.

40:37.271 --> 40:39.147
Tell the truth.

40:39.731 --> 40:44.361
Tell the truth, Katherine.
Time is running out.

40:46.405 --> 40:49.032
Tell the truth.

40:52.536 --> 40:54.621
Get that down now. Where's Martin?

40:54.705 --> 40:55.706
Shut it all down.

40:55.789 --> 40:57.207
-We're trying.
-Don't try. Do it.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.459
And warn the clients to do the same.

41:00.961 --> 41:02.254
Too late.

41:03.839 --> 41:06.049
Does anyone know who this guy is?

41:07.259 --> 41:10.512
-Who is he? Where is he from?
-Calling for Eric Cresswell.

41:13.182 --> 41:14.308
It's been an hour

41:14.391 --> 41:18.061
since Katherine Newman's statement
was intercepted by the group.

41:18.145 --> 41:19.688
As yet there's been no word

41:19.771 --> 41:23.650
from the police in the UK or the US
about any further contact

41:23.734 --> 41:26.361
with those responsible
for Leo Newman's kidnap.

41:26.445 --> 41:28.947
As for any link between Katherine Newman

41:29.031 --> 41:32.868
and the man identified by the kidnappers
as Eric Cresswell…

41:37.039 --> 41:38.540
-Hi.
-Hi. Sorry to bother you.

41:38.624 --> 41:39.875
We come in peace.

41:39.958 --> 41:41.084
You can't be here.

41:41.168 --> 41:43.003
-I'm Aadesh. This is Eddie.
-Eddie.

41:43.086 --> 41:46.340
I know who you are, and you can't be here.
How did you find me?

41:46.423 --> 41:49.760
This guy, you give him the Internet,
and he can do anything.

41:49.843 --> 41:52.262
Apart from kidnap people obviously.

41:53.931 --> 41:55.182
We think we're being set up.

41:56.600 --> 42:00.354
I mean, unless-- Did you do it?

42:00.896 --> 42:02.523
Leave now or I'll call the police.

42:02.606 --> 42:03.649
Please, Tara, just one minute.

42:03.732 --> 42:06.902
Yeah, we can't let them
turn us into bloody--

42:07.986 --> 42:09.279
-Patsies.
-Patsies.

42:09.363 --> 42:10.572
Go away.

42:11.532 --> 42:12.533
Tara!

42:24.169 --> 42:25.212
Thank you.

42:28.882 --> 42:30.092
Your flat's that way.

42:31.176 --> 42:34.513
I don't think
Joe's going to want to see me, do you?

42:36.098 --> 42:37.724
It's all right. You can have the bed.

42:40.018 --> 42:42.229
You really think
things can just go back to normal?

42:43.772 --> 42:47.693
Actually, Mon,
after being arrested on my wedding day,

42:47.776 --> 42:49.027
shot by a psychopath

42:49.111 --> 42:51.738
and bailed to appear
in court tomorrow, no.

42:52.531 --> 42:54.783
I don't think
anything's very normal right now.

42:58.203 --> 43:00.038
Fine. Then I'll go to a hotel.

43:02.749 --> 43:05.377
Monique. Monique, come on.

43:06.253 --> 43:07.254
Monique.

43:08.338 --> 43:09.882
Monique, please.

43:11.133 --> 43:12.342
Mon, can you just stop?

43:12.426 --> 43:13.427
What?

43:17.806 --> 43:21.768
I know you're angry,
but I'm not leaving you, okay?

43:21.852 --> 43:24.855
Whether you talk to me or not, I won't.

43:26.523 --> 43:28.025
Not while he's still out there.

43:31.028 --> 43:32.404
Come on. Let's go home.

43:34.698 --> 43:35.866
Yeah.

43:48.378 --> 43:50.422
Hey, you got any change? I'm five p short.

43:50.506 --> 43:51.882
You went behind my back.

43:52.382 --> 43:54.843
Over your head, actually,
and I tried to talk to you about it.

43:54.927 --> 43:57.387
And I listened,
but it's my job to make decisions.

43:57.471 --> 44:01.725
Or it was, till you ran to my boss.
Got your own way.

44:01.808 --> 44:04.937
He told you to put everything on Tilson,
keep him from leaving the country?

44:05.020 --> 44:06.355
He'd already done it.

44:06.438 --> 44:07.856
And had the Thompsons released.

44:07.940 --> 44:11.527
You had no right to do that.
You have no jurisdiction here.

44:11.610 --> 44:13.946
Yeah, but I do have
a responsibility, okay?

44:14.029 --> 44:17.074
And I can't stand by anymore
while you waste time watching those guys.

44:17.157 --> 44:19.243
And what exactly
would you have done differently, Scott?

44:20.410 --> 44:22.412
For a start, I would've
squeezed them hard enough

44:22.496 --> 44:25.666
so we would know
exactly how good they are at lying by now.

44:32.172 --> 44:34.007
We should've started
with Natalie Thompson.

44:34.675 --> 44:35.676
I told you.

44:35.759 --> 44:37.553
The police,
they took her from work. It's online.

44:37.636 --> 44:39.179
Then why haven't they picked us up?

44:40.013 --> 44:42.808
I'm gonna try one more time. Stay here.

44:46.353 --> 44:47.437
Shit--

44:48.981 --> 44:50.232
God, mate, I'm so sorry.

44:50.315 --> 44:52.609
-I told you to go away!
-Yeah, I know. I'm so sorry.

44:52.693 --> 44:54.278
Were you gonna break into my car?

44:54.361 --> 44:56.905
-Wait. What is this?
-No, no!

44:56.989 --> 44:59.199
Oh, my God. No! No!

45:01.869 --> 45:03.370
Get off me! No!

45:03.954 --> 45:05.372
Okay.Okay.

45:06.623 --> 45:07.875
-No!
-Hey!

45:07.958 --> 45:09.710
Okay. Take it easy.

45:09.793 --> 45:10.794
Oh, no!

45:11.879 --> 45:12.880
Jesus.

45:13.964 --> 45:15.257
No, no, no.

45:29.813 --> 45:31.523
I can't believe they're kidnapping us.

45:32.357 --> 45:34.318
-Who is?
-I don't know.

45:35.444 --> 45:38.280
If any of you know anything,
please just tell them.

45:38.363 --> 45:40.866
-I've got a daughter.
-We all have family.

45:44.912 --> 45:46.205
I think we're on the motorway.

45:48.790 --> 45:50.334
Why take us out of the city?

46:22.824 --> 46:23.825
Move!

46:25.118 --> 46:26.370
Get up!

46:27.829 --> 46:28.997
Let's go. Move!

46:29.081 --> 46:31.041
-Okay.
-On your knees.

46:31.124 --> 46:32.251
Don't touch her.

46:35.796 --> 46:36.797
Fuck.

46:38.507 --> 46:39.591
Who are you?

46:39.675 --> 46:41.426
Where is Leo Newman?

46:41.510 --> 46:44.972
You either talk and get on that plane,
or you die right here.

46:45.722 --> 46:47.891
Which is it? Where is he?

46:47.975 --> 46:50.018
Eyes forward. Where's Leo?

46:50.102 --> 46:52.354
I don't know, man. I don't know!

46:52.437 --> 46:55.816
Choose! Where's Leo? Start talking!

46:55.899 --> 46:57.317
Where's Leo Newman?

46:57.401 --> 46:59.403
None of us know.

47:00.904 --> 47:02.072
No.

47:02.155 --> 47:03.615
Where is he?

47:03.699 --> 47:05.576
You. Where's Leo Newman?

47:08.871 --> 47:11.373
You can either get on that plane,
or you die right here.

47:11.456 --> 47:12.791
You've got the wrong people.

47:31.935 --> 47:33.020
Get down!

47:43.614 --> 47:44.698
No!

47:48.619 --> 47:51.079
Hey! Get in the car!

47:52.915 --> 47:54.082
Quickly!

47:55.709 --> 47:56.752
Mon?

47:57.294 --> 47:58.504
Come on.

48:00.547 --> 48:05.177
Mon.

48:06.053 --> 48:08.722
Please get up. Get up.

48:10.891 --> 48:12.726
Please get up.

48:20.859 --> 48:23.529
There's more on the plane.
Get in the fucking car now!

48:24.238 --> 48:25.489
Come on. Get up.

48:25.572 --> 48:27.491
-There's more on the plane.
-Get up.

48:27.574 --> 48:30.702
Oh, my God. There's more of them.

48:31.411 --> 48:32.412
Get up!

48:32.496 --> 48:33.872
-We gotta go.
-Get up, please!

48:33.956 --> 48:35.874
-Come on.
-There's more coming.

48:35.958 --> 48:37.793
No, I can't leave her! No!

48:37.876 --> 48:40.170
Natalie! Natalie!

48:43.715 --> 48:45.926
We're in. Drive! Go!
