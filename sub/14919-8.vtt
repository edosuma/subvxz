WEBVTT

00:10.063 --> 00:11.391
What? Hello. There's...

00:11.907 --> 00:14.354
Don't you worry. It's only me.

00:18.256 --> 00:21.922
There is no such thing
as only you, Kimberly.

00:21.923 --> 00:22.726
Mm?

00:22.727 --> 00:25.851
Boy, this is bizarre.
It's not my birthday.

00:25.852 --> 00:27.618
Mnh-mnh. You're not
holding a cake.

00:31.454 --> 00:32.017
Mm.

00:32.018 --> 00:33.074
You lock the door?

00:33.518 --> 00:34.384
No.

00:36.463 --> 00:37.230
Oh!

00:37.534 --> 00:40.111
Oh, gosh. Oh. Oh. I am so sorry.

00:40.182 --> 00:45.214
I'm so sorry! Justin,
is the bar set up for the lunch rush?

00:45.215 --> 00:46.886
Uh, you know, not yet.

00:46.887 --> 00:49.607
I was looking for olives,
but we're out,

00:49.667 --> 00:51.365
uh, so I was just
trying to get some.

00:51.366 --> 00:54.529
Well, you know, time's wastin',
so chop chop.

00:54.530 --> 00:56.723
Yep. Be right there. All right.

00:59.455 --> 01:00.288
Oh!

01:08.146 --> 01:11.570
That ignorant, small-minded,
friggin' Neanderthal!

01:11.799 --> 01:12.694
Well, technically,

01:12.695 --> 01:14.743
it's pronounced "neander-tall."

01:16.550 --> 01:17.699
And you must have finally met

01:17.700 --> 01:20.243
our very own Giddrick Reischel.

01:20.415 --> 01:22.015
Huh. Yeah.

01:22.927 --> 01:25.081
I-I-I foolishly listened

01:25.082 --> 01:27.693
to his stupid, right-wing,
call-in show

01:27.694 --> 01:28.950
last night on the
way home from work,

01:28.951 --> 01:31.923
and it was filled with l...
I mean filled with lies...

01:31.963 --> 01:34.706
lies about global warming,
lies about immigration,

01:34.707 --> 01:35.734
lies about health care.

01:35.735 --> 01:37.982
And so right now in the hallway,
I-I-I ran into him,

01:37.983 --> 01:39.012
and I thought I would set

01:39.013 --> 01:41.249
him straight about a
few facts. Oh, Nora.

01:41.250 --> 01:44.206
You can't believe the
vile things he said to me.

01:44.207 --> 01:45.525
Well, you can't
take it personally.

01:45.526 --> 01:46.893
He's like that with everybody.

01:46.894 --> 01:48.777
How can I not
take it personally?

01:48.778 --> 01:51.067
He called my show "ask madam Mao."

01:52.060 --> 01:54.345
Ooh! Would you care
for some coffee?

01:54.346 --> 01:57.098
No. No, thank you.
Um, look, sit down.

02:03.799 --> 02:04.729
Take a breath.

02:06.281 --> 02:07.750
Now do you know who

02:07.751 --> 02:10.375
the two biggest advertisers
are on his show?

02:10.467 --> 02:11.373
Haven't a clue.

02:11.374 --> 02:13.377
Laser beam home security systems

02:13.378 --> 02:16.401
and herbal-firm male
potency pills. Ah.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.553
Now as a trained psychotherapist,

02:18.554 --> 02:21.563
that tells me two things
about him and his audience...

02:21.818 --> 02:23.609
Paranoid personality type

02:23.610 --> 02:27.482
with accompanying morbid
insecurity disorder.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.698
Talking to you always
makes me feel better.

02:33.083 --> 02:35.978
Oh. That's what friends
are for, right?

02:36.971 --> 02:37.920
Right.

02:40.918 --> 02:41.878
Okay.

02:44.375 --> 02:46.225
You know, I was just
reading here in the paper,

02:46.226 --> 02:49.354
there's a-a documentary
about Leonard Bernstein

02:49.355 --> 02:51.323
on public television tonight.

02:51.607 --> 02:55.111
Oh, my God. I have been in
love with him since I was 20.

02:55.247 --> 02:57.390
Well, would you like to come
over and watch it with me?

02:58.203 --> 02:59.161
At your house?

02:59.162 --> 03:02.523
Yeah. I-I just got this, uh,
this big screen television.

03:02.954 --> 03:05.787
I mean, we'll be able to
see the entire orchestra.

03:06.335 --> 03:08.254
Well, how could I say no?

03:08.994 --> 03:09.762
What time?

03:10.058 --> 03:13.691
Well, it starts at 10:00,
so, uh, 9:45?

03:15.223 --> 03:16.151
Perfect.

03:17.607 --> 03:18.582
Perfect.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.594
He invited you at 9:45
for a 10:00 TV show?

03:22.595 --> 03:23.506
Well, he's a shrink.

03:23.507 --> 03:26.349
Maybe he's only comfortable
in 45-minute increments.

03:26.350 --> 03:28.072
I know you wanna take
this to the next level.

03:28.073 --> 03:29.850
I don't think that
even counts as a level.

03:29.851 --> 03:33.897
That's like the elevator stalled
between floors. We did agree

03:33.898 --> 03:35.649
to be friends early on. Mom,

03:35.650 --> 03:37.706
you love your job.
You enjoy Karl's company.

03:37.707 --> 03:39.257
If you get into a
romantic relationship,

03:39.258 --> 03:41.218
and one of you gets hurt,
then you've lost a friend

03:41.219 --> 03:42.754
and screwed up your
work situation.

03:42.755 --> 03:45.006
What if he is actually
the man of my dreams,

03:45.007 --> 03:47.557
and... and I miss my chance?
You know what?

03:47.558 --> 03:48.901
I'm in over my head.
Why don't you ask Sarah?

03:48.902 --> 03:51.305
Well, I can't ask Sarah.
If this deal goes through,

03:51.306 --> 03:53.574
then she'll be my boss.
She'll be his boss.

03:53.575 --> 03:55.509
Mom, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
I'm hosting lunch,

03:55.510 --> 03:58.727
and I've accidentally overbooked
the reservations. Where's Saul?

03:59.085 --> 04:00.506
Wine convention, Napa.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.857
And since this is Justin's first
double shift behind the bar,

04:02.858 --> 04:04.535
and I clearly have no
idea what I'm doing,

04:04.962 --> 04:06.577
Scotty's a little
freaked out. Honey,

04:06.578 --> 04:08.734
well, just pretend you
have people skills.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.800
Uh, I-I gotta go.

04:10.888 --> 04:12.529
Talk to you later. Bye, mom.

04:12.530 --> 04:15.486
Um, Angie, have you met my brother Kevin?
Uh, nice to meet you.

04:15.487 --> 04:18.510
Nice to meet you. My God,
your hands are cold. You okay?

04:18.511 --> 04:21.646
We were in the walk-in
cooler for a while.

04:22.801 --> 04:24.854
Getting beer. Yeah.
It can take a while.

04:24.855 --> 04:25.781
You don't want to startle the beer

04:25.782 --> 04:28.868
by moving it too fast.
I should get back to the kitchen.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.000
I'll come with you.
Talk to you later.

04:31.105 --> 04:31.746
Bye, sweetie.

04:31.747 --> 04:32.531
Talk to you later.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:44.371 --> 04:45.958
Luc, um... hey.

04:46.051 --> 04:47.217
I couldn't find a number

04:47.218 --> 04:50.218
of the notary that we used
for the Maris media proffer,

04:50.219 --> 04:52.719
so I was scrolling down
the calls from last week,

04:52.720 --> 04:55.839
and I came across
"Gabriela Laurent."

04:58.175 --> 05:00.447
Why didn't you tell me
that your mother called?

05:00.627 --> 05:01.844
It slipped my mind.

05:03.063 --> 05:05.498
O-okay. Uh, uh, what did she say?

05:05.499 --> 05:08.043
She wants to come for a visit.
What did you tell her?

05:08.099 --> 05:11.277
The truth. It's not a good time for me.
You told her not to come?

05:11.278 --> 05:13.989
I gotta finish my sketches for
the Shanghai mural by next week.

05:13.990 --> 05:15.681
Okay? I-I thought you were
almost done with those.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.330
They're really great, by the way.

05:18.374 --> 05:19.879
Look, she's not a part of my life.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.631
I've set it up that way.
That's the way I like it. No, I-I know.

05:23.827 --> 05:26.354
It's just, Luc,
what if I want to meet her?

05:26.527 --> 05:27.823
Can we talk about this later?

05:27.905 --> 05:30.105
I wish you would tell me
why you feel so strongly.

05:30.106 --> 05:31.146
I'm completely...

05:31.831 --> 05:34.374
Sarah, there's nothing more to
talk about. Answer the phone.

05:36.710 --> 05:39.063
Hey, mom. Just, uh, wait a sec.

05:41.385 --> 05:43.309
Sarah, did you listen
to my show this morning?

05:43.310 --> 05:45.274
Because I think I really
hit it out of the park.

05:45.275 --> 05:47.476
Did you hear the call
from the guy from Oxnard

05:47.477 --> 05:50.486
who doesn't get on with his mother?
No, I didn't.

05:50.595 --> 05:53.459
Five minutes in, and he's
bawling like a baby. Bawling.

05:53.639 --> 05:55.386
What did you say? Sarah, honey,

05:55.387 --> 05:56.906
if you're planning on
buying the station,

05:56.907 --> 05:57.910
I really think you should

05:57.911 --> 06:00.806
take an interest in it.
Mom, I'm interested.

06:00.807 --> 06:03.690
I'm asking you, what did you
say to the guy to make him cry?

06:03.691 --> 06:06.850
Well, I can't describe it to you.
You had to be there.

06:06.851 --> 06:10.118
I gotta come in later to meet
the station manager... Norbert.

06:10.138 --> 06:12.346
I'll listen to it then,
okay? Um...

06:13.886 --> 06:15.741
You know what, honey?
Would you mind asking him

06:15.742 --> 06:17.365
if the company happens to have

06:17.366 --> 06:20.198
a policy about workplace
relationships?

06:20.487 --> 06:24.734
Why? Is somebody screwing somebody? No,
no. Nothing like that.

06:24.735 --> 06:26.940
Just a-a girl in
accounting was wondering.

06:26.941 --> 06:28.560
Why don't you ask him yourself?

06:28.823 --> 06:30.126
Well, I-I, um...

06:30.127 --> 06:32.789
Oh, mom, I gotta go.
I got a notary here.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.181
Sarah. Sarah, never mind.

06:34.182 --> 06:37.542
Don't ask about the policy thing.
So just forget about it. Okay.

06:40.594 --> 06:42.114
Ah. Hello. Come in.

06:42.395 --> 06:43.148
Sarah?

06:43.665 --> 06:44.275
Yeah.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.102
It's me... Gabriela.

06:50.354 --> 06:51.970
You must call me maman.

06:53.739 --> 06:55.150
Oh. Wow.

06:55.151 --> 06:56.159
Wow!

06:57.074 --> 06:58.326
Oh. Oh.

06:58.327 --> 06:59.910
That... you... Wow. Oh.

07:00.207 --> 07:01.582
Oh, my... oh!

07:02.758 --> 07:04.295
Wow. Oh!

07:23.525 --> 07:26.742
Gabriela, Luc... uh,
s'il vous plait? Â¿Por favor?

07:30.411 --> 07:34.734
Shh. Sarah, as a mother,
I'm sure you understand

07:34.735 --> 07:37.157
that sometimes you miss
your children so much...

07:37.158 --> 07:39.285
You just cannot
stay away from them.

07:39.286 --> 07:40.214
Oh, totally.

07:40.215 --> 07:45.047
And when I heard from his cousin
Albert he was getting married,

07:45.191 --> 07:48.022
my only desire was come
here and meet Sarah.

07:48.078 --> 07:50.498
Oh! Oh, that... that's so sweet.

07:50.499 --> 07:53.935
Well, I've been dying to meet you,
too. Oh. Merci.

07:54.659 --> 07:57.123
Luc told me how busy he is,

07:57.183 --> 08:00.735
so I went ahead and
booked a hotel room.

08:01.075 --> 08:01.990
***

08:01.991 --> 08:04.093
oh, no, no, no, no. You don't
have to do that. You know what?

08:04.094 --> 08:04.554
Yes, we have to do that.

08:04.555 --> 08:06.293
My kids are staying with
their dad this week,

08:06.294 --> 08:08.854
so you can take my
daughter's room. Sarah, no.

08:09.002 --> 08:13.106
No, no, no, no.
Sarah, I would rather die

08:13.107 --> 08:16.047
before I distract my
genius son from his work.

08:16.833 --> 08:20.194
Well, let me at least take you.
It's the least I can do.

08:20.362 --> 08:23.262
I've just got a couple of small
business errands I've gotta run.

08:23.263 --> 08:25.830
Actually, you should come with me.

08:25.831 --> 08:27.396
You could meet my mother.

08:27.397 --> 08:29.251
What? You're so lovely.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.694
Thank you. Ah.

08:31.695 --> 08:34.225
Oh, I'm so glad I came, Sarah.

08:34.226 --> 08:35.890
We're gonna have a great time.

08:37.135 --> 08:38.191
Ohh!

08:45.203 --> 08:46.509
I just sat my first two patrons.

08:46.510 --> 08:48.466
Yeah, I saw that. You put them
at a 4-top instead of a deuce.

08:48.467 --> 08:50.694
You can't do that
when we're overbooked.

08:50.810 --> 08:54.120
You only put 2 people at a 4-top
when there are no empty deuces.

08:54.261 --> 08:55.962
Oh, and I need you to tell
everybody on the floor

08:55.963 --> 08:57.597
we're eighty-six on
the Dover sole. Okay,

08:57.598 --> 08:59.095
I have no idea what you're
talking about right now,

08:59.096 --> 09:00.562
but I'm incredibly turned on.

09:00.563 --> 09:02.157
Well, apparently,
both of you Walker boys

09:02.158 --> 09:05.803
find restaurant work arousing.
You know about Justin?

09:05.804 --> 09:08.274
Yeah, I caught him making out in
the storage room this morning.

09:08.275 --> 09:10.498
Oh, my God. He's dedicated. Yeah.

09:10.499 --> 09:12.595
He finished up his hanky-panky
in the walk-in cooler.

09:13.098 --> 09:14.138
I just hope he knows
what he's doing.

09:14.139 --> 09:16.289
That Kimberly girl
is a little wacky.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.779
I thought her name was Angie.

09:17.780 --> 09:19.363
Angie... my sous-chef?

09:20.611 --> 09:21.927
No wonder she keeps disappearing.

09:21.928 --> 09:25.209
Who's Kimberly? Kimberly's the
waitress with the southern accent

09:25.210 --> 09:27.497
and the gun collection.
Are you serious?

09:27.498 --> 09:29.571
Yeah. You need to talk to him.
Tell him to knock it off.

09:29.572 --> 09:32.244
I can't have him two-timing
my staff. How many guns?

09:32.327 --> 09:35.106
I don't know.
She's from Texas. Kevin,

09:35.147 --> 09:37.018
you gotta get out there.
Okay, wish me luck.

09:37.019 --> 09:39.342
If you see Angie, tell her I
need her in the kitchen now.

09:39.343 --> 09:41.034
All right. You might
wanna hide the knives.

09:43.872 --> 09:44.694
Portugal... yeah.

09:44.695 --> 09:46.317
I've always wanted to go there.

09:46.318 --> 09:48.783
I lived in Paris most of my life,

09:48.862 --> 09:52.353
but I still have the strong
bond to my home country.

09:52.354 --> 09:55.017
You know, Luc never mentioned
he's half-Portuguese.

09:55.018 --> 09:57.233
I'd be surprised to
hear that he mentions

09:57.234 --> 09:59.059
anything about me at all.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.124
I'm sorry.

10:01.126 --> 10:04.519
Luc doesn't approve
the life I've led.

10:04.951 --> 10:06.167
That's why I'm here...

10:06.270 --> 10:09.823
to see if I can repair
what's broken with us,

10:10.458 --> 10:11.706
to meet Sarah...

10:12.218 --> 10:14.186
And to give them my blessing.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.994
But he just pushes me away.

10:17.362 --> 10:19.215
Oh, God. I know how
painful that is.

10:19.216 --> 10:23.086
Look, my son Tommy and I went
through a very rough patch.

10:23.191 --> 10:25.586
But listen, with a little patience

10:25.587 --> 10:28.163
and a big nudge from Sarah and me,

10:28.439 --> 10:30.758
maybe we can help you
and Luc work this out.

10:31.704 --> 10:33.461
That'll make me so happy.

10:33.462 --> 10:34.369
Let's go find Sarah.

10:34.370 --> 10:36.563
I'm sure she's out of
her meeting by now.

10:36.799 --> 10:38.629
I used up too much
of your time already.

10:38.630 --> 10:40.434
Look, I'll get my luggage

10:40.435 --> 10:44.029
and take a taxi back
to the hotel. Hotel?

10:44.030 --> 10:47.482
Yeah, Luc doesn't want
me interrupting his work.

10:47.483 --> 10:49.257
That's okay. It's better that way,

10:49.258 --> 10:52.041
that I give him some air.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:52.042 --> 10:55.002
There will be no hotels and
there will be no taxis.

10:55.003 --> 10:57.450
I really want you to be
a guest at my house...

10:57.451 --> 11:00.825
I have plenty of room...
and for as long as you like.

11:01.059 --> 11:03.018
Oh, you are so kind.

11:03.019 --> 11:05.638
I do have one little
engagement this evening,

11:05.639 --> 11:08.006
but that'll give you time
to get unpacked and settled.

11:08.007 --> 11:11.046
And who is that adorable man?

11:12.871 --> 11:13.734
Karl.

11:14.443 --> 11:15.801
That's... Karl.

11:15.802 --> 11:18.491
Dr. Karl west.
He's a psychotherapist.

11:18.522 --> 11:19.162
Ooh.

11:19.163 --> 11:22.730
I always fall in love
with my analysts.

11:22.913 --> 11:26.082
There is just something
about them, you know?

11:26.083 --> 11:27.178
Uh, you know, the...

11:27.179 --> 11:30.746
The engagement I have
this evening is with Karl.

11:30.831 --> 11:32.676
Oh, you're lovers!

11:32.677 --> 11:33.909
No. No?

11:33.989 --> 11:35.386
Not exactly. Not exactly?

11:35.387 --> 11:36.497
Maybe. Maybe?

11:36.498 --> 11:38.466
I'm not sure. I am sure.

11:38.611 --> 11:41.987
You cannot let the handsome
doctor get away. Come on.

11:49.415 --> 11:51.368
Don't be silly.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.125
Women are friends with women,

11:54.126 --> 11:55.501
men are friends with men,

11:55.502 --> 11:58.125
and gay persons are
friends with everybody.

11:58.126 --> 12:00.345
Well, I don't know if I think
that's completely true,

12:00.346 --> 12:04.043
but there is the bigger issue,
that Karl and I work together.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.658
I don't understand what you mean.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.907
Well, mixing business with
pleasure is frowned upon.

12:11.125 --> 12:12.596
Only Americans

12:12.597 --> 12:14.862
find an excuse to
frown on pleasure.

12:14.863 --> 12:16.239
It's crazy.

12:16.413 --> 12:18.597
All right, let me be
completely honest with you.

12:18.598 --> 12:20.770
Look, you've had three marriages

12:20.771 --> 12:22.310
and lots of lovers.

12:22.311 --> 12:24.985
Mm. I-I just don't think you've
experienced much rejection

12:24.986 --> 12:27.606
in your life, and once
you reach a certain age,

12:27.607 --> 12:31.050
it's scary to stick your wrinkly
old neck out there again.

12:31.227 --> 12:35.946
If it scares you,
then you should probably do it.

12:35.947 --> 12:36.734
Ah.

12:36.735 --> 12:40.399
And I have experienced in my life

12:40.402 --> 12:44.498
very painful rejection
from my only son.

12:44.906 --> 12:46.710
So I do know it.

12:46.711 --> 12:49.174
Oh, Gabriela, I'm so sorry.

12:50.058 --> 12:52.346
I've had three husbands.

12:52.635 --> 12:54.858
You've had five children.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.823
So please help me.

12:57.013 --> 12:59.013
Give me an advice.

12:59.014 --> 13:01.121
Okay, first of all,

13:01.122 --> 13:02.998
you and Luc aren't
gonna solve anything

13:03.038 --> 13:05.871
until you can spend some
time together and talk.

13:07.914 --> 13:10.859
Let's invite Luc and Sarah
over for dinner tonight.

13:11.033 --> 13:13.538
Tonight? Yes, tonight.
The sooner, the better.

13:13.539 --> 13:16.045
Here... neutral territory.
I'll help you cook,

13:16.046 --> 13:19.060
and then I'll slip
away and go see Karl,

13:19.061 --> 13:22.450
and the three of you can have
some serious time together.

13:22.538 --> 13:24.858
But what if he won't come?

13:24.963 --> 13:26.958
He will come. I'll talk to Sarah.

13:26.959 --> 13:29.150
Now when Luc was small,

13:29.151 --> 13:31.265
what was the one dish
you would cook for him

13:31.266 --> 13:33.234
that was his absolute favorite?

13:34.527 --> 13:36.319
Moroccan. Yeah.

13:36.869 --> 13:38.836
He loved Moroccan food.

13:39.081 --> 13:41.375
And I used to cook for him
all the time morn food.

13:41.434 --> 13:46.251
He was very little, 7 or 8,
but he used to love it.

13:46.371 --> 13:47.698
Then Moroccan it is.

13:47.699 --> 13:49.667
Yes! Okay, tell me what we need.

13:50.962 --> 13:52.931
And someone named Jennifer called,

13:53.158 --> 13:54.988
twice, on the reservation line.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.615
Jennifer? Mm.

13:56.858 --> 13:57.946
You have a last name?

13:58.363 --> 14:02.042
Uh, no. Why, is there
more than one Jennifer?

14:02.077 --> 14:04.494
There can never be
enough Jennifers.

14:07.687 --> 14:09.065
Okay, you know what?
You're actually

14:09.066 --> 14:11.185
now out of control.
You are multi-tonguing

14:11.186 --> 14:13.518
two different women behind every
closed door in this restaurant.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.190
Now you have Jennifers
coming out of your ears.

14:15.191 --> 14:16.122
You wanna tell
me what's going on?

14:16.123 --> 14:16.929
I don't know what's going on.

14:16.930 --> 14:18.230
I'm not doing anything different.

14:18.231 --> 14:19.972
It feels like I'm in a
"Girls Gone Wild" video.

14:19.973 --> 14:20.686
Oh, come on.

14:20.687 --> 14:22.650
No, I'm serious. I'm not
even hitting on these girls.

14:22.731 --> 14:23.875
They're just coming on to me.

14:23.903 --> 14:25.290
It's like I'm
giving off, like...

14:25.578 --> 14:27.146
like a musk or something...

14:27.147 --> 14:29.227
Or the army did some
breeding experiment on me.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.915
It's awesome. Would you
listen to yourself?

14:31.962 --> 14:34.317
Kevin, there's something going on.
I don't know what it is,

14:34.318 --> 14:36.005
but I'm certainly
not gonna stop it.

14:36.006 --> 14:38.202
You have to stop,
okay? Because you've had your fun.

14:38.203 --> 14:41.066
No. Okay? I haven't had my fun.

14:41.387 --> 14:45.318
Look, Captain happy
is finally remembering

14:45.319 --> 14:46.437
What it's like to be single.

14:46.438 --> 14:48.718
You named your
penis Captain Happy?

14:48.719 --> 14:50.313
Will the straight
clichÃ©s ever end?

14:50.314 --> 14:53.258
Oh, I don't know.
Why don't you ask little big man?

14:57.703 --> 14:59.017
I can't believe I told you that.

14:59.018 --> 15:00.090
You didn't tell me.

15:00.138 --> 15:02.105
You told Tommy,
and then Tommy told me.

15:03.909 --> 15:05.497
Here's the thing...
Scotty is freaking out

15:05.498 --> 15:07.293
there's gonna be some kind
of catfight in the dish room,

15:07.294 --> 15:08.953
okay? Tell him not to
be nervous. All right?

15:08.954 --> 15:10.753
I have this figured out.
Angie works lunches,

15:10.754 --> 15:12.298
and Kimberly now works
the dinner shift.

15:12.299 --> 15:13.353
They're never gonna cross paths.

15:13.354 --> 15:15.053
Is it too much to ask you
schedule your hookups

15:15.054 --> 15:17.663
on your own time? Oh, Kev...
No, that's fine. That's fair.

15:17.722 --> 15:20.970
Thank you. I forget.
What was Tommy's?

15:20.971 --> 15:23.738
The magnificent seven.
Yeah, right. He wishes.

15:23.809 --> 15:26.657
I just bought a
7-pound leg of lamb

15:26.658 --> 15:28.321
because Gabriela told me to,

15:28.322 --> 15:31.922
and three boxes of couscous.
She is going to make

15:31.923 --> 15:34.086
Luc's favorite Moroccan
dinner tonight.

15:34.087 --> 15:35.799
Oh, mom, that is a great idea.

15:35.858 --> 15:38.536
Have you ever asked him why
he's so resentful of her?

15:38.537 --> 15:40.235
Oh, he's so vague about it.

15:40.634 --> 15:43.502
"She is self-centered,
she's overly dramatic."

15:43.503 --> 15:45.598
It's nothing we all
haven't been through.

15:46.682 --> 15:47.579
Excuse me?

15:47.922 --> 15:49.587
That came out wrong. Yeah.

15:49.994 --> 15:52.586
Do you think you can get
him to come? Absolutely.

15:52.631 --> 15:54.846
Mom, it's a serious
red flag for me

15:54.847 --> 15:56.465
when a man doesn't get
along with his mother.

15:56.466 --> 15:59.610
It is not a healthy sign.
Honey, you know Dr. Karl,

15:59.611 --> 16:02.417
at the station? Oh, yeah.
I met him this afternoon. Nice guy.

16:02.418 --> 16:06.575
He wrote this really wonderful,
wonderful article about how men

16:06.590 --> 16:09.709
often seek to recreate their
maternal relationships

16:09.710 --> 16:11.742
by the women they choose to marry.

16:11.803 --> 16:14.537
It's so interesting.
You gotta get me that.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.921
I will. So 7:30 tonight, okay?

16:16.965 --> 16:18.838
Okay. Okay, mom.
We'll see you then.

16:21.375 --> 16:22.239
Who are we seeing?

16:23.170 --> 16:23.906
Mom.

16:24.322 --> 16:25.843
She invited us to dinner tonight.

16:26.231 --> 16:29.383
And who is "us"? You and me...
And your mother.

16:29.843 --> 16:31.971
Unh-unh. No.
I'm way too busy tonight.

16:31.972 --> 16:34.426
Oh, come on, Luc.
She's traveled so far to see us,

16:34.438 --> 16:37.414
and she's making your
favorite Moroccan dinner.

16:37.678 --> 16:38.393
You've gotta go.

16:38.394 --> 16:41.226
Oh, this is typical.
I don't like Moroccan food.

16:41.263 --> 16:44.014
She likes Moroccan food.
She doesn't even cook, Sarah.

16:45.507 --> 16:47.678
Luc, you're gonna have to
talk to her sooner or later.

16:47.679 --> 16:48.766
Let's just go over there tonight...

16:48.767 --> 16:51.151
If I'm done with all my work,
then I'll go. Okay?

16:51.998 --> 16:54.354
Okay. Okay. We don't have
to be there right at 7:30.

16:54.355 --> 16:57.154
We... we... we could go later.

16:59.391 --> 17:00.542
Gabriela?

17:02.951 --> 17:04.916
Gabriela? I'm back.

17:04.917 --> 17:06.134
In here!

17:06.442 --> 17:09.261
Well, I thought you were gonna
start chopping the onions,

17:09.262 --> 17:10.840
at least preheat the oven.

17:10.842 --> 17:13.755
We have a huge,
big lamb roast to cook.

17:19.273 --> 17:20.779
Wow. Look at this.

17:20.827 --> 17:23.709
I borrowed some little
things from outside,

17:23.710 --> 17:25.795
some little things from upstairs,

17:25.962 --> 17:27.888
and voilÃ ! What do you think?

17:27.890 --> 17:29.812
It looks like a Bedouin tent.

17:29.813 --> 17:35.046
Yes. I wanted to make it
as romantic as possible.

17:36.007 --> 17:37.334
For Luc and Sarah?

17:37.575 --> 17:40.390
No! I have a surprise for you.

17:40.594 --> 17:44.183
Karl called. His television
cable went kaput,

17:44.383 --> 17:47.519
so he was asking if
he could come here

17:47.601 --> 17:49.347
to watch your television,

17:49.431 --> 17:52.029
and I told him yes, of course.

17:52.030 --> 17:55.303
Isn't that perfect?
It's gonna be a party!

17:55.304 --> 17:57.553
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Look, it isn't a party.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.142
No, this is serious.

17:59.143 --> 18:03.818
Oh, nothing is so serious
that you cannot enjoy yourself

18:03.819 --> 18:06.741
while you're doing it.

18:06.742 --> 18:09.521
Well, you can't mix
Leonard Bernstein

18:09.522 --> 18:11.827
and the... and the
queen of the gypsies.

18:11.898 --> 18:14.955
Hey. What are you
so mad at me for?

18:14.974 --> 18:16.745
I didn't kaput his television.

18:16.746 --> 18:18.682
Well, you should not
have told him to come

18:18.683 --> 18:20.738
without talking to me first.
Oh, fine.

18:20.739 --> 18:23.917
Good. Okay. You call him.
You tell him not to come.

18:23.918 --> 18:25.306
That would be rude.

18:25.307 --> 18:27.946
Yeah, and also be stupid,

18:28.271 --> 18:30.095
because you love him.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.554
Oh.

18:40.180 --> 18:41.465
This roast is gonna take

18:41.466 --> 18:43.218
at least two and a
half hours to cook.

18:43.219 --> 18:45.501
That means we won't be
eating till almost 10:00,

18:45.502 --> 18:48.654
and the only appetizers
we have are olives and dates.

18:48.655 --> 18:49.554
No candles.

18:49.555 --> 18:51.233
Oh, well, try the pantry,

18:51.234 --> 18:54.274
right over there.
Oh, oh, 10:00 is perfect.

18:54.535 --> 18:57.698
Oh, look, Gabriela, this...
this whole thing has gone haywire.

18:57.699 --> 19:00.163
I-I think we have to go
back to the original plan.

19:00.164 --> 19:03.570
The whole point of this was
so you can Luc could sit down,

19:03.578 --> 19:06.635
spend some time together,
and sort things out,

19:06.843 --> 19:10.301
and Karl and I could have a nice,
quiet evening together.

19:10.302 --> 19:12.454
Yeah, of course, but, look,

19:12.455 --> 19:14.999
we cannot just jump
into the heavy talk.

19:15.030 --> 19:18.775
We should keep things
light at first. Ahh!

19:19.118 --> 19:20.014
What?

19:20.795 --> 19:22.810
You have absinthe.

19:22.859 --> 19:26.997
Oh, my God. That thing
must be 10 or 15 years old.

19:26.998 --> 19:28.466
I forgot it was even in there.

19:28.467 --> 19:33.075
Do you know, Nora, I'm gonna
make my famous absinthe tea.

19:33.267 --> 19:36.113
And do you know the
secret of my absinthe tea?

19:36.838 --> 19:37.474
No.

19:37.475 --> 19:39.234
There is no tea in it!

19:41.970 --> 19:44.819
W-when did you tell
Karl to get here?

19:45.204 --> 19:46.602
00.

19:46.603 --> 19:49.062
Oh, no! I haven't
had time to change.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.582
I smell like lamb fat,
for God sakes!

19:51.583 --> 19:54.047
No, you look great.
You're a natural beauty.

19:54.127 --> 19:56.702
You're fantastic. VoilÃ .

19:57.262 --> 19:59.567
Let's go. Let's go and meet your man.
Come on. Come on.

20:02.942 --> 20:03.806
It's good.

20:07.715 --> 20:08.178
Hi.

20:08.179 --> 20:10.659
Hi. Come on in.

20:10.660 --> 20:11.909
Thank you. It's a beautiful house.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.609
This is... this is for you.
Thank you.

20:13.610 --> 20:14.399
Sure.

20:15.372 --> 20:17.385
Um, Karl, um... mm-hmm.

20:17.559 --> 20:20.996
I would like you to meet my friend,
Gabriela Laurent.

20:20.997 --> 20:21.919
Hi.

20:21.999 --> 20:22.875
Enchante.

20:22.876 --> 20:26.551
I am so... speechless.

20:27.710 --> 20:31.760
Gabriela Laurent... uh,
"la Rhapsodie de la chair"...

20:31.761 --> 20:33.778
Is one of my favorite films.

20:33.779 --> 20:36.384
I can't believe you know my film.

20:36.385 --> 20:38.974
Well, I'm a bit of a
francophile and a cinephile,

20:38.975 --> 20:41.308
so I've seen all of
the French new wave.

20:41.309 --> 20:43.400
I can't believe I'm
actually standing here,

20:43.587 --> 20:46.174
talking to the
Gabriela Laurent. Oh.

20:46.822 --> 20:50.522
You were in a film? Yeah,
when I was very young.

20:50.696 --> 20:52.508
A director discovered me

20:52.509 --> 20:55.046
at a little cafÃ©
on Saint-Germain.

20:55.759 --> 20:57.116
What's the name of the film?

20:57.117 --> 20:59.583
"La Rhapsodie de la chair"...

21:00.158 --> 21:01.696
"the rhapsody of the flesh."

21:01.697 --> 21:03.431
Yeah. Oh.

21:05.468 --> 21:07.180
So let's all get in,

21:07.181 --> 21:10.405
and I'll make you both a drink.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.493
What a wonderful surprise.

21:15.613 --> 21:17.250
Wonderful surprise!

21:21.764 --> 21:22.889
Angie! Hey.

21:22.890 --> 21:25.600
Hi. I didn't... I didn't know you

21:25.601 --> 21:27.650
were working tonight.
Yeah, I'm covering for Nick.

21:27.651 --> 21:30.101
Yeah, I... I brought you some
hot tea for your throat.

21:30.102 --> 21:33.368
I put honey and... and lemon in it.
Uh, for... for my throat?

21:33.369 --> 21:33.988
Yeah. Kevin said you were

21:33.989 --> 21:37.813
coming down with the flu.
Oh, he did? No, no, no.

21:37.814 --> 21:40.292
He totally has me confused
with someone else.

21:40.293 --> 21:41.943
So you're not getting a cold sore?

21:42.194 --> 21:44.773
A cold... No! I'm not
getting a cold sore. No.

21:44.774 --> 21:46.699
My lips are totally fine.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.993
Oh! Okay. That's a relief. Yeah.

21:51.538 --> 21:53.032
You know, a hundred years ago,

21:53.033 --> 21:56.809
people believed that...
that absinthe could drive you insane.

21:56.810 --> 22:00.143
Well, if that's true,
then you're here to cure us. Mm.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.600
Well, don't worry about me.

22:03.087 --> 22:06.236
I think people should go a
little crazy now and then.

22:06.802 --> 22:07.777
Hello?

22:08.189 --> 22:10.326
Oh. Hi. Hello.

22:11.576 --> 22:13.889
Wow. This... this is nice.

22:14.389 --> 22:15.639
Sarah, where's Luc?

22:15.826 --> 22:18.065
Oh. Uh, Luc had a lot of work.

22:18.066 --> 22:19.737
He's really sorry
he couldn't make it.

22:19.738 --> 22:23.008
No, Gabriela. Gabriela,
we can do this again tomorrow night.

22:23.009 --> 22:26.402
He just can't stand to be
in the same room with me.

22:26.403 --> 22:28.756
Oh, no. No, no.
That... that... that's not true.

22:28.757 --> 22:30.342
Wh-what have I done

22:30.911 --> 22:33.472
for him to despise me so much?

22:33.473 --> 22:36.570
He doesn't. He does not despise you.
He's gonna come around.

22:36.571 --> 22:38.571
He's gonna come around.
Mom's right.

22:38.710 --> 22:40.758
He... he... he's gonna come around.
You'll see.

22:41.108 --> 22:42.659
Gabriela, listen.

22:42.660 --> 22:45.070
I want you to take a
deep breath, okay?

22:46.833 --> 22:48.843
Now you're amongst friends, okay?

22:48.844 --> 22:52.169
If there's anything we can do
to help you, you just say so.

22:53.844 --> 22:54.656
There you go.

22:57.306 --> 22:58.256
Better?

23:02.593 --> 23:04.392
What did you say to them?!
Nothing.

23:04.393 --> 23:06.238
Kevin, I'm doing my job.
I'm being friendly.

23:06.239 --> 23:09.092
What happened? I had a party of
four women waiting for a table.

23:09.093 --> 23:10.404
When I go to seat them,
all of a sudden,

23:10.405 --> 23:11.208
they're no longer hungry.

23:11.209 --> 23:12.832
They wanna eat peanuts
at the bar. Okay.

23:12.833 --> 23:15.236
So now I'm losing customers.
Justin, this has to stop. Yeah.

23:15.237 --> 23:18.325
You guys act like I can
control this. Justin?

23:19.887 --> 23:21.151
Hey. Are you okay?

23:21.152 --> 23:23.783
Yeah. Do you have a fever? Oh,
let me feel your forehead,

23:23.784 --> 23:25.826
you poor baby.
Kimberly, I'm fine. Thank you.

23:25.827 --> 23:27.703
I don't know. You feel
a little warm to me.

23:27.704 --> 23:30.536
Then again, I think you
always run a little hot.

23:31.643 --> 23:32.573
Ooh! Uh, Kimberly,
you know what? Table seven...

23:32.574 --> 23:33.215
Uh, Angie, would you mind
going to the storeroom...

23:33.216 --> 23:34.342
Needs, uh, more water right now.

23:34.343 --> 23:35.430
Thank you. Getting me
some lentils? Thanks.

23:35.705 --> 23:39.779
Great. Go home.

23:39.834 --> 23:41.491
What? You heard me. Out of here.

23:41.492 --> 23:43.627
Look, that fever thing is Kevin's fault.
Take over the bar.

23:43.628 --> 23:44.538
What?! Justin, leave through

23:44.539 --> 23:45.932
the back door and
don't speak to anyone.

23:45.933 --> 23:47.572
Scotty, you're acting
like this is my fault. Go!

23:47.573 --> 23:49.069
Okay. Way to go, Captain Happy.

23:49.070 --> 23:49.907
Now!

23:51.389 --> 23:53.389
Mom, why is Dr. Karl here?

23:53.651 --> 23:55.201
It's a long story.

23:55.489 --> 23:58.272
Well, I'm glad he came.
He put Gabriela back in a party mood,

23:58.273 --> 24:00.683
though this absinthe
probably didn't hurt.

24:00.684 --> 24:03.150
Why are you cooking?
I thought she was making dinner.

24:03.151 --> 24:06.563
She was in charge
of the couscous. Ew.

24:06.564 --> 24:10.099
I rest my case. I may not
be a French film star,

24:10.100 --> 24:11.535
but I guess I'm
good for something.

24:11.536 --> 24:13.978
Luc, never mentioned
anything to me about a film.

24:13.979 --> 24:16.711
If Dr. Karl hadn't have brought it up,
I would never have known.

24:17.399 --> 24:19.161
I think he's attracted to her.

24:20.132 --> 24:20.970
Oh.

24:21.432 --> 24:22.845
It's just my luck.

24:24.069 --> 24:26.428
I finally find a man
I'm interested in,

24:26.429 --> 24:29.233
and "the rhapsody of
the flesh" shows up.

24:29.234 --> 24:33.297
You're interested in Dr.
Karl? Mom, why didn't you tell me?

24:33.298 --> 24:36.697
Well, I didn't wanna put you
in an awkward situation.

24:36.698 --> 24:38.402
You're practically my boss.

24:38.403 --> 24:40.706
Oh, for God sake, mom,
don't worry about that.

24:40.707 --> 24:43.136
Have you told him how you feel?

24:43.137 --> 24:46.780
No. No. Well, not in so many words.
Has he told you?

24:47.542 --> 24:49.925
He invited me to watch
a television program

24:49.926 --> 24:52.176
with him tonight, but it doesn't
look like that's gonna happen.

24:52.177 --> 24:57.094
No, mom, get out there. Stake your claim.
I have a lamb to baste

24:57.095 --> 24:58.879
and a pot of couscous to make.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.322
Mom, I will baste,

25:01.323 --> 25:05.052
and I will couscous. Go on.
You go out and have fun.

25:07.309 --> 25:08.696
You might want to hurry up.

25:24.293 --> 25:26.755
Oh, Nora!

25:27.318 --> 25:31.229
I am feeling so much better.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.816
You know, your friend, Dr. Karl...

25:33.979 --> 25:36.003
Helping me a lot.

25:38.166 --> 25:39.627
I'm so glad.

25:39.628 --> 25:42.758
Yeah. So now you come and
dance with me. Come on.

25:42.759 --> 25:44.094
Oh, no.

25:44.205 --> 25:46.797
No. You're... you're
really welcome to join us

25:46.798 --> 25:49.198
as we watch the Leonard
Bernstein program...

25:49.199 --> 25:51.705
With us. It's... it's...
it's almost ready to start.

25:51.706 --> 25:53.805
Is it that time already? Oh,
my goodness.

25:53.806 --> 25:55.521
Well, I-I, you know,
I feel... I feel terrible.

25:55.522 --> 25:57.531
I don't wanna break up
this wonderful party

25:57.532 --> 26:01.010
for my... my t-television show.
But maybe you and I could watch,

26:01.011 --> 26:03.754
uh, Leonard Bernstein
together some other time?

26:04.229 --> 26:07.454
Of course. Of course.

26:07.716 --> 26:09.878
I was hoping you'd say that.

26:10.929 --> 26:11.922
Nora? Yeah?

26:11.923 --> 26:15.436
Now you and I will dance for Karl.

26:15.437 --> 26:19.308
Oh, boy, that sounds like fun. No.

26:19.309 --> 26:21.143
Nora, Nora, please.
Please. No, no,

26:21.144 --> 26:22.535
no. Nora, Nora, no, no, no.
Please, please. Come on.

26:22.536 --> 26:24.226
Come on. Come on. I'll dance, Nora.
I'll dance if you will.

26:24.227 --> 26:26.642
Please. I have a lamb to look at.

26:28.229 --> 26:30.842
Nora! I'll teach you!

26:32.791 --> 26:33.479
Oh.

26:34.704 --> 26:35.554
I quit.

26:35.593 --> 26:38.068
She wins. I can't
compete with that.

26:38.255 --> 26:40.685
I'm not exotic or
sexy or European.

26:40.686 --> 26:44.346
Mom, don't give up. Just go out there and...
and... and you be you.

26:44.347 --> 26:46.113
Mm. It's fine. It's fine.

26:46.114 --> 26:48.368
I'll just stay in here
and baste and stir

26:48.369 --> 26:50.513
and hope that Karl notices
me for my cooking.

26:50.514 --> 26:53.671
Mom, you listen to me.
This is what's gonna happen...

26:53.672 --> 26:55.095
I am gonna go out there,

26:55.096 --> 26:59.020
I am gonna lure Gabriela
away from Dr. Karl...

26:59.021 --> 27:02.010
Yeah. Then you come in
and you make your move.

27:02.466 --> 27:04.166
I have no move.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.353
Buck up!

27:06.261 --> 27:09.058
Where is Nora?
She's missing all the fun.

27:09.059 --> 27:12.074
I don't understand her
and all this rules about

27:12.075 --> 27:14.811
how you can't mix
business and pleasures

27:14.812 --> 27:18.249
and you can only be friends
with a man you work with.

27:18.801 --> 27:19.498
She said that?

27:19.499 --> 27:22.223
Mm-hmm. Isn't that crazy?

27:22.511 --> 27:26.551
Well... Hey, Sarah! Come.
Dance with us.

27:26.552 --> 27:28.392
Oh, you know, I would love to,
but we've run out

27:28.393 --> 27:31.139
of your fabulous absinthe tea,
so I was hoping that you could

27:31.140 --> 27:33.693
come back and mix up
another batch. Oh,

27:33.694 --> 27:36.240
no. We're not out. We have
the whole pitcher right here.

27:36.241 --> 27:39.696
Where's Nora? Yes.
Tell her to come and dance with us.

27:39.697 --> 27:42.972
I'll see if I can find her. Sarah.

27:44.135 --> 27:45.506
What the hell is going on here?

27:45.507 --> 27:47.731
What are you doing here?
I came to pick up my phone charger,

27:47.732 --> 27:50.097
and I-I figured mom would be asleep,
but she's in the kitchen

27:50.098 --> 27:52.259
half-sloshed,
looking like someone died.

27:52.509 --> 27:55.135
And don't look now,
but who is the woman

27:55.136 --> 27:57.496
doing the dance of the seven
veils on our coffee table?

27:57.497 --> 27:58.964
Okay. Listen to me.
I need your help.

27:58.965 --> 28:01.138
I know this sounds weird,
but I need you to go in there

28:01.139 --> 28:03.171
and get her away from him, okay?

28:03.172 --> 28:04.863
Just distract her.
What do you mean, distract her?

28:04.864 --> 28:07.333
Just go with it! Okay, Sarah,
what are you talk... s...

28:13.265 --> 28:15.530
Mom. W-what are you doing?

28:15.531 --> 28:18.268
A little lamb died
for no good reason.

28:18.269 --> 28:19.701
Mom, you gotta pull
yourself together.

28:19.702 --> 28:22.177
You-you're gonna go out there,
and you tell him how you feel.

28:22.178 --> 28:25.565
I feel... like an idiot.

28:25.814 --> 28:29.651
Mom, he has come over
here to see you, okay?

28:29.652 --> 28:31.876
So you go out there
and you talk to him.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.910
He's by himself.
The coast is clear.

28:33.911 --> 28:38.301
Nora? Sorry. Um, there's someone
at the front door, Nora.

28:38.302 --> 28:39.276
I'll get it.

28:43.625 --> 28:44.561
Are you okay?

28:44.563 --> 28:46.363
You... you... you disappeared.

28:47.188 --> 28:48.599
Just doing some cooking.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.674
Oh, I-I feel terrible.

28:49.675 --> 28:51.649
I mean, you've been
in here slaving away,

28:51.650 --> 28:52.974
and we've been out there,
you know,

28:52.975 --> 28:56.474
kicking up our heels.
You're just doing your job,

28:56.475 --> 28:58.674
helping a woman in distress.

28:58.675 --> 29:01.679
Well, I'm here to
help you now. Okay?

29:01.937 --> 29:04.013
So let's put this on.

29:04.474 --> 29:07.674
You tell me... what I can...

29:09.187 --> 29:11.049
I think this, uh, absinthe

29:11.261 --> 29:13.274
interferes with motor...

29:14.437 --> 29:15.486
Functions.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.340
Oh. Okay.

29:18.952 --> 29:19.727
Thank you.

29:34.678 --> 29:38.430
Oh, no! No. No. No.
I-I-I di... I didn't see that coming.

29:38.431 --> 29:39.104
Oh, my God. It's just

29:39.105 --> 29:40.748
that I thought you just
wanted to be friends.

29:40.749 --> 29:43.427
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. No.

29:48.433 --> 29:49.408
Justin!

29:51.582 --> 29:52.246
Justin?

29:52.247 --> 29:54.677
Justin, what the hell are you doing?!
You told me to go with it.

29:54.678 --> 29:57.934
This is Luc's mother.
What?! Why didn't you tell me it's...

29:59.301 --> 30:00.239
Luc...

30:02.938 --> 30:05.476
Sarah and Nora asked me
to come and talk to you.

30:05.490 --> 30:08.729
I didn't want to, but I thought
I would try one more time.

30:08.730 --> 30:11.867
And here you are. You could
not give me a real family

30:11.868 --> 30:14.621
when I was growing up,
and now that I finally found one,

30:14.622 --> 30:16.139
you come here and
you tear it apart.

30:16.140 --> 30:20.682
Luc, I came here to
be with your family,

30:20.683 --> 30:21.944
not tear it apart.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.972
You have no idea how
to be in a family!

30:23.973 --> 30:25.596
You can't be part of anything

30:25.597 --> 30:27.352
that is not completely about you!

30:27.511 --> 30:30.811
I don't want you in
this family! Luc...

30:52.176 --> 30:54.426
Hey, mom. It's, uh, it's Justin.

30:54.688 --> 30:57.079
And I just wanna let you know

30:57.080 --> 30:59.410
that I put everyone's
keys in the breakfast nook

30:59.411 --> 31:01.125
'cause I didn't
want anyone driving.

31:01.126 --> 31:04.922
And I hope you're all
feeling better this morning.

31:04.923 --> 31:09.453
And again, I'm really,
really sorry about last night.

31:09.765 --> 31:11.429
All right. Love you, mom. Bye.

31:12.566 --> 31:13.162
Hey.

31:13.163 --> 31:16.738
Kevin told me, uh, things got
pretty wild at your mom's.

31:16.739 --> 31:17.700
Yeah.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.865
Apparently, Sarah's pretty pissed.

31:19.866 --> 31:21.548
I know. Aw, man.

31:23.173 --> 31:24.385
Justin, um,

31:25.223 --> 31:26.585
is everything okay?

31:28.222 --> 31:29.251
Yeah.

31:29.252 --> 31:31.001
God, look, it's just, I...

31:32.161 --> 31:33.869
I feel like I've been
under such stress

31:33.870 --> 31:36.148
and that I'm finally
able to be myself

31:36.149 --> 31:39.017
and... and relax a little bit for
the first time in a long time.

31:39.018 --> 31:41.672
And, you know, I don't know,
I got a little carried away,

31:41.673 --> 31:44.843
and I didn't stop and think how
it could affect other people,

31:44.844 --> 31:45.719
like you.

31:46.582 --> 31:49.456
So... Scotty, I'm sorry.

31:50.182 --> 31:51.145
I appreciate that.

31:51.856 --> 31:53.923
And not to be a hypocritical boss,

31:53.924 --> 31:56.330
but I am officially
putting a moratorium

31:56.331 --> 31:58.641
on workplace hookups.
I endorse that 100%,

31:58.642 --> 32:00.668
and I will come clean
with Angie and Kimberly.

32:00.912 --> 32:01.686
Good.

32:03.111 --> 32:06.499
You know about, um,
her gun collection, right?

32:07.686 --> 32:08.586
Gun collection?

32:09.183 --> 32:11.471
Kimberly. Gun, like, real?

32:11.472 --> 32:12.855
Real. Wow.

32:22.469 --> 32:24.220
Oh. Oh. Hi. You're awake.

32:24.221 --> 32:25.456
Yeah. Good morning.

32:26.119 --> 32:28.443
I thought maybe you could
use a cup of coffee.

32:28.444 --> 32:30.668
Oh, thank you very much.
Here. I know I sure can.

32:31.205 --> 32:34.576
Uh, here are your car keys.
Oh, great.

32:35.276 --> 32:36.888
Okay. Nora. Nora, please.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.387
I need to explain about...
No,

32:38.388 --> 32:40.640
you don't. You don't
need to explain anything.

32:40.641 --> 32:42.706
Look, I value our
friendship very much,

32:42.707 --> 32:43.838
and I love working with you.

32:43.839 --> 32:45.795
I-I hope you can just forget

32:45.796 --> 32:48.148
about that stupid
move of mine in there.

32:48.149 --> 32:49.293
It was completely inappropriate.

32:49.294 --> 32:51.850
Lis... could you... could you
just sit down, please?

32:53.424 --> 32:55.075
Look, Nora,

32:55.428 --> 32:58.050
I was under the apparently
mistaken impression

32:58.051 --> 33:02.049
that you were committed to our
relationship being platonic.

33:02.261 --> 33:06.183
So when you tried to kiss me,
I was surprised for a moment,

33:06.184 --> 33:09.113
and... and then when I got my
wits about me, y-you'd run away.

33:12.996 --> 33:14.146
What, you...

33:14.147 --> 33:16.341
You don't want to
be just platonic?

33:16.342 --> 33:20.654
No. No, no. I was hoping
that Leonard Bernstein

33:20.655 --> 33:23.220
would give me the courage...
To kiss you.

33:23.825 --> 33:24.414
Really?

33:24.415 --> 33:25.151
Mm-hmm.

33:26.915 --> 33:29.198
Well, then what the heck was
all of that with Gabriela?

33:29.199 --> 33:31.875
I mean, you seemed to be having
a really good time with her.

33:31.876 --> 33:34.889
We were, but she is a
classic narcissist.

33:34.890 --> 33:36.976
I mean, nobody is
more fun at a party,

33:36.977 --> 33:38.281
but, you know, they're incurable.

33:38.282 --> 33:41.349
And you should never,
ever get in a relationship with one.

33:41.350 --> 33:44.475
Well, there you go again,

33:45.028 --> 33:46.425
making me feel better.

33:47.852 --> 33:48.939
Oh, Karl.

33:51.139 --> 33:52.942
This is all very complicated

33:52.943 --> 33:54.578
because we work together,

33:54.579 --> 33:56.949
and I don't want to
lose your friendship,

33:58.273 --> 33:59.873
whatever happens between us.

34:01.215 --> 34:02.140
Nora...

34:04.302 --> 34:06.514
I will always be your friend.

34:13.156 --> 34:13.869
You awake?

34:14.370 --> 34:16.134
Yeah, unfortunately.

34:17.130 --> 34:20.565
When will I learn not to
drink on an empty stomach?

34:21.540 --> 34:23.565
I'm sorry I was so angry
with you last night.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.194
I wanted to apologize
when I got home,

34:26.195 --> 34:27.614
but it was too late to call.

34:28.327 --> 34:31.389
That's okay. I'm sorry I butted in

34:31.389 --> 34:33.339
on your relationship
with your mother.

34:33.456 --> 34:36.592
You were right. I should have
come when you asked me to.

34:36.594 --> 34:38.386
I could have put a
stop to these things

34:38.387 --> 34:40.172
before it got out of hand,
for sure.

34:40.174 --> 34:42.955
No. I think it would have
turned to hell no matter what.

34:45.467 --> 34:46.591
I guess now you understand why

34:46.592 --> 34:47.929
I have all these
problems with her.

34:47.931 --> 34:50.891
Luc, I understand that
you're angry with her,

34:51.080 --> 34:54.379
but I don't understand why you
can't talk to me about it.

34:58.279 --> 34:59.154
What do you want to know?

34:59.829 --> 35:00.380
Everything.

35:00.381 --> 35:05.043
Anything that would help me
understand the two of you.

35:06.355 --> 35:08.355
That will take a very long time.

35:10.618 --> 35:13.592
Why didn't you tell me that
your mother was in a film?

35:14.130 --> 35:16.141
I never saw it.
It was another thing

35:16.142 --> 35:18.810
that was more important
to her than I was.

35:18.811 --> 35:21.373
What else was more
important to her than you?

35:23.336 --> 35:26.323
When I was 6 years old,
she left my father for another man.

35:26.822 --> 35:28.997
She moved away, left us both.

35:30.398 --> 35:32.709
And then, when this
man threw her out,

35:33.251 --> 35:34.409
she came back to us.

35:34.859 --> 35:36.872
It was great for a while...

35:37.310 --> 35:39.910
At least, until she left again...

35:40.985 --> 35:41.860
For another man.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.738
Look, she broke my father's heart,
over and over.

35:46.739 --> 35:48.664
And she broke your heart, too.

35:53.524 --> 35:54.233
Wow. Listen, Luc,

35:54.234 --> 35:56.733
I... I'm not gonna tell
you what you should do,

35:56.835 --> 36:00.435
but maybe you can think
about who she is now.

36:02.110 --> 36:04.191
She's the same woman
she always was.

36:04.192 --> 36:05.190
She will never change.

36:05.191 --> 36:06.791
You're probably right.

36:07.428 --> 36:10.838
She will never be the mother
that she should have been.

36:11.888 --> 36:13.462
It's up to you whether or not

36:13.463 --> 36:15.500
you want the mother you got.

36:19.970 --> 36:20.895
Yeah.

36:37.979 --> 36:41.394
Gabriela, no. No, no, no.
You... you don't have to leave.

36:41.395 --> 36:43.367
I'm not angry, honestly.

36:43.691 --> 36:46.072
I didn't realize he was your son.

36:46.073 --> 36:49.324
Look, it was all just a
huge misunderstanding.

36:49.325 --> 36:51.083
And... and Justin is a grown-up.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.915
He... he's allowed to
kiss whomever he wants.

36:54.290 --> 36:57.866
Yeah. Well, as you said,

36:58.666 --> 37:01.964
last night, things went haywires.

37:01.965 --> 37:05.071
Look, um, I think you and I

37:05.072 --> 37:08.018
were both afraid
of being rejected...

37:08.019 --> 37:10.023
me by Karl, you by Luc...

37:10.024 --> 37:12.801
and so we just slipped back
into our comfort zones.

37:13.114 --> 37:14.876
You danced, and I cooked.

37:14.877 --> 37:18.969
Yeah. And I made my son
furious with me again.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.008
Luc...

37:21.383 --> 37:23.557
He's like all the men in my life.

37:23.983 --> 37:25.465
They love me at first,

37:25.466 --> 37:28.861
but then they get
eventually tired of me,

37:28.862 --> 37:30.283
and they ask me to leave.

37:31.044 --> 37:32.294
Well, why do you think that is?

37:32.295 --> 37:34.682
Because they see through me,

37:35.045 --> 37:37.794
and especially Luc.

37:38.157 --> 37:40.498
He... he's immune to my charms.

37:40.499 --> 37:42.581
Well, Luc is your son.

37:42.582 --> 37:45.956
You can't charm him or dazzle
him with your charisma.

37:45.957 --> 37:48.893
All you can do is present
yourself honestly,

37:49.194 --> 37:51.376
admit your mistakes,
point out your flaws,

37:51.377 --> 37:53.543
and hope for the best.

37:56.305 --> 37:59.392
I think it's just too late for me.

38:04.879 --> 38:06.092
Hey. Hey.

38:06.692 --> 38:10.104
So... I'm here to
apologize to you.

38:10.118 --> 38:11.423
You don't have to apologize to me.

38:11.424 --> 38:14.898
You should talk to Kimberly and
Angie and mom. I did already.

38:14.899 --> 38:16.824
All right? I get it.
I was a jerk. You were right.

38:16.825 --> 38:18.848
Well, I was a little hard on you.

38:18.849 --> 38:20.398
I am slightly
sensitive about people

38:20.399 --> 38:22.714
having workplace dalliances
with the waitstaff.

38:22.715 --> 38:24.748
Yeah, I can understand that.

38:24.749 --> 38:27.167
But you... you and Scotty
are better, right?

38:27.517 --> 38:29.942
We're getting through it... you know,
good days and bad.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.546
Well, look, I mean,

38:32.678 --> 38:34.396
you are very lucky
to have a marriage

38:34.397 --> 38:36.315
where you're both
willing to work on it.

38:37.116 --> 38:39.173
I don't know how lucky
I felt at the time.

38:39.174 --> 38:40.905
Anyway, you're the one
who's turned getting lucky

38:40.906 --> 38:42.093
into an art form.

38:42.806 --> 38:46.312
Yes, but I put Captain
happy on probation.

38:46.313 --> 38:48.521
Yeah. You still working
the lunch shift?

38:48.522 --> 38:51.760
Yes, but this is my final week.
I gave Scotty my notice.

38:51.761 --> 38:53.983
Oh. Funny. I don't think
he's gonna miss me.

38:53.984 --> 38:56.767
Don't take it too bad.
He fired me, so I'm gonna sue him.

38:57.968 --> 38:58.730
All right.

39:01.180 --> 39:01.778
Oh, hey.

39:01.779 --> 39:02.308
Yeah?

39:02.309 --> 39:05.123
What's Luc's mom like? Oh,
she's hot.

39:05.124 --> 39:07.468
Down, boy. Right. Ugh.

39:07.469 --> 39:08.319
Good.

39:08.550 --> 39:10.687
So I want to get my
phone and call the kids.

39:10.688 --> 39:13.060
Oh, here you two are.
Good morning. Good morning.

39:13.061 --> 39:16.616
Karl, I don't think you
officially met Luc. Hi.

39:17.190 --> 39:18.390
Nice to meet you.

39:18.677 --> 39:21.257
Likewise. And I'm sorry about
everything that happened.

39:21.258 --> 39:24.065
No, no, no. Please. Please.
No... no problem, not at all.

39:24.702 --> 39:27.379
Is my mother up yet? Yes.
She's in the kitchen.

39:27.380 --> 39:30.189
She insisted on cleaning up
the mess from last night.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.114
That will take some doing.

39:33.101 --> 39:33.901
Excuse me.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.892
Is that a good sign or a bad sign?

39:38.893 --> 39:41.266
Good, I think. I hope.

39:41.267 --> 39:43.791
Well, at least they're talk.
It's a start.

39:45.377 --> 39:46.364
Uh-oh.

39:46.627 --> 39:48.128
That's definitely not talking.

39:49.602 --> 39:50.561
Oh, boy.

39:50.562 --> 39:53.000
Well... well, maybe she
dropped it accidentally.

39:53.962 --> 39:55.811
No. No, that one was on purpose.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.239
You know what?
I'm just gonna peek in there

39:57.240 --> 39:58.755
and make sure it's
not the good China.

39:58.756 --> 40:00.618
Don't worry.
It's not eavesdropping.

40:00.619 --> 40:02.442
I can't understand a
single word they say.

40:02.443 --> 40:05.185
Mom, I'll pay for
anything that gets broken.

40:05.260 --> 40:06.210
God.

40:06.292 --> 40:09.067
You know, the French
are very expressive.

40:11.579 --> 40:12.922
You know, mom told
me that you believe

40:12.923 --> 40:15.904
that men marry women
like their mother.

40:15.988 --> 40:18.651
Please tell me that that
does not apply here.

40:19.455 --> 40:23.869
Oh, boy. Well, if you're asking
me if you're like Gabriela,

40:23.870 --> 40:25.942
I would say, probably not.

40:26.292 --> 40:28.785
I mean, she's a little insecure,
self-obsessed,

40:28.786 --> 40:30.121
a bit histrionic...
A bit?

40:30.122 --> 40:34.851
Well, on the other hand,
she's also very strong,

40:34.852 --> 40:37.079
single-minded, resourceful.

40:37.104 --> 40:39.798
I'd say that Luc is
a very smart man.

40:39.799 --> 40:43.833
He chose a mate who has all
of his mother's best traits,

40:44.133 --> 40:45.498
who can also give him

40:45.499 --> 40:47.820
the close family
he's always wanted.

40:48.945 --> 40:50.782
You are very good.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.475
I feel like I owe you 100 bucks.

40:53.476 --> 40:54.642
More like $220,
but don't worry about it.

40:54.643 --> 40:55.511
Oh.

40:58.699 --> 40:59.461
Listen.

41:01.773 --> 41:02.757
Oh, God. I hope that doesn't mean

41:02.758 --> 41:04.279
that they're both unconscious.

41:04.754 --> 41:07.383
Sarah, come here.
I want you to look at this. What?

41:07.384 --> 41:08.703
Just go look.
