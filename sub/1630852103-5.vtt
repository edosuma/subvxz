one text message and, like, that's it.

and, like,
I'm not gonna be bullied by him.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.815
[Davina] When I left the Oppenheim Group,
there was a little tension

03:10.899 --> 03:14.277
because of what had happened
with the $75 million listing,

03:14.360 --> 03:15.904
because it didn't sell,

03:15.987 --> 03:17.780
but he wasn't supportive
from the beginning,

03:17.864 --> 03:19.991
and it just didn't start off the best way.

03:20.074 --> 03:22.952
I have built a reputation
of well-priced listings.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.205
I'm a broker too.
Like, it's my reputation.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.790
-It's the Oppenheim Group listing.
-[Davina] But it's me too.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.043
-[Jason] It is.
-I'm putting my face on there.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.836
Yes, and you shouldn't be anymore.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.505

could work together?

03:34.589 --> 03:37.592
I think there's definitely possibility.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.886
He's adding more and more people
to the brokerage,

03:39.969 --> 03:43.723
and I just hope he doesn't say,
"There's no more spots left."

That's the only way I'll figure it out.

Apparently, yes, it was
her first time meeting me.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.860
She blacked out the scene
when she was banging on my doors.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.488
Christine didn't want
to be accountable for her actions.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.199
She wanted to brush it off
like nothing happened,

06:06.282 --> 06:09.410
like she didn't meet me
when she was banging on my window,

06:09.494 --> 06:12.622
screaming bloody murder,
with her friend on the other side.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.249
-Thank you so much.
-[Mary] Thank you.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.086
I mean, that was
a whole playing dumb, whatever.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.129
That's fine. She wants to play that card.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.883
Well, at least she wasn't attacking you,
so… silver lining.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.344
I would've thought that having the baby

06:26.427 --> 06:30.223
would've made her, you know,
grow up a little bit and not be like that,

06:30.306 --> 06:32.517
but then to come in
like, "Nice to meet you,"

06:32.600 --> 06:33.893
give me a hug, stuff--

06:33.976 --> 06:35.478
The games are still going on.

06:35.561 --> 06:39.565
The games are just not ending,

06:42.819 --> 06:44.153

06:44.237 --> 06:48.282
and I am so tired
of all of these stupid games.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.661
I don't know what to do.
The baby's there, everyone's holding it.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.539
Is it bad that I didn't try to?

06:54.622 --> 06:57.083
But then she didn't invite me
to the baby shower,

06:57.166 --> 06:59.419
so I'm not gonna come up
and grab her baby.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.879
-[Emma] No.
-Like, that is so inappropriate.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.799

I'm like, "I don't know what to do."

[Emma] I was sitting there, same thing.
I didn't know what to do.

the time of day and not you

-For being friends with me.
-[Mary] I just always have hope.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.481
Maybe the baby changed her.
Maybe she'll soften.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.360
Maybe she'll, like,
have bigger things going on in her life,

07:24.444 --> 07:26.904
and she'll just be like,
"Oh, my God, I was so dumb."

07:26.988 --> 07:29.157

09:05.419 --> 09:07.421
-Have a look at the kitchen.
-Oh, my God.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.090
Okay, this is my vision.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.425
-Nice work on the kitchen.
-I take full credit.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.969
[Jason] This is gorgeous.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.264
I love these shelves
and the LED lighting underneath it,

09:16.347 --> 09:19.517
and how you matched
the wood over here. I really love it.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.144
So I'd love to discuss
the price with you guys.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.856
Yeah. Usually, when I walk into a house
that someone's done this nicely,

09:25.940 --> 09:28.150
and it's designer,
and it's curated like this--

09:28.234 --> 09:29.360
Around 75 million?

09:29.443 --> 09:32.863
Yeah, the price is usually
a little unrealistic, so…

09:32.947 --> 09:35.616
I would be a very,
very happy woman at 4.2.

09:35.700 --> 09:39.745
-I'm sure you would be happy at 4.2.
-[Amanda] Okay, tell me your feelings.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.415
[Jason] Price per square foot
is gonna, like, break a record

09:42.498 --> 09:44.083
if we get $4 million for this.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.419
Surprisingly, I completely agree with you.

09:46.502 --> 09:47.670
-Wow.
-[Davina] I know.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.922
That is surprising
if you knew our history.

09:50.006 --> 09:54.218
I think 3,995 is more appropriate
for the house and the square footage

09:54.302 --> 09:56.012
and all the details and the comps.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.306
I would feel
like I was selling myself short

09:58.389 --> 09:59.807
based on the time and energy,

09:59.890 --> 10:02.727
the passion, and the literal dollar amount
of the items in here.

10:02.810 --> 10:07.315
You could have spent $600,000
remodeling a piece of shit,

10:07.398 --> 10:08.858
and adding a ton of value.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.861
Instead, you bought a basically new house,
and then remodeled.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.362
I knew that while doing it,

10:13.446 --> 10:16.032
that not everything
would make sense to every person

10:16.115 --> 10:18.492
and wouldn't add value
in the traditional sense,

10:18.576 --> 10:20.578
but we only need one person who gets it.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.914
-Oh, God. I hate that line.
-[Amanda] We only need one buyer.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.542
-[Jason] Oh, God.
-No, listen! I'm gonna go woo.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.295
That's my worst sentence
in real estate right there.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.464
Soul mates and buyers.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.341
-Yeah.
-We only need one sometimes.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.052
She's an adviser, I'm an adviser,
so you got some advice.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.304
-You don't have to follow it.
-I appreciate it.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.515
I'm taking it all to heart.
I'm gonna let you guys look around.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.935
I have some work to do upstairs.
Let me know if you have any questions.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.354
Thanks so much, Amanda.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.773
-[Jason] You wanna go outside?
-Yeah.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.524
[Jason] Look how charming that is.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.277
I do like how private it is.
I mean, that's really nice.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.236
[Davina] I agree.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.988
[Jason]
Even the front yard, super private.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.240
[Davina] So how's the office?
How's everybody there?

10:58.324 --> 11:01.035
All great. Everyone seems
like they're doing really well.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.371
I heard Chrishell bought her own place.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.997
She found an epic house.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.458
It's perfect for her.
It's private, it's gated.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.919
Especially in this market.
Nothing's available!

11:10.002 --> 11:11.504
I don't know how she did it.

11:11.587 --> 11:14.757
I heard you were the agent
representing Chrishell on her purchase.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.676
Of course, I help everyone on their deals,

11:16.759 --> 11:19.970
but super frustrating for her,
you can imagine this proud moment,

11:20.054 --> 11:21.972
and I'm getting credit for what she did.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.141
She's rightfully upset about it.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.185
Chrishell might have a buyer for this.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.562
Well, it is very Oppenheim Group.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.522
Yes, it is.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.066
Don't get me wrong,
this is right up our alley.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.944
You know I left
because of a new development opportunity

11:35.027 --> 11:36.112
at the other brokerage,

11:36.195 --> 11:37.863
but the job is completed.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.615
The consulting is all wrapped up.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.536
And it was a very… corporate environment.

11:43.619 --> 11:46.038
And, while I can easily function there,

11:46.122 --> 11:48.833
I do love the closeness
and the access to you,

11:48.916 --> 11:52.128
and just the camaraderie
you have at the Oppenheim Group.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.087
I miss that

11:53.170 --> 11:55.715
and, I don't know,
I think maybe we should talk

11:55.798 --> 11:56.882
about me coming back.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.429
-Um, I'm open to it.
-[laughs nervously]

12:01.512 --> 12:03.055
I'm open to that discussion.

12:03.139 --> 12:07.935
One of the frustrations before you left
was an overpriced listing.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.896
-That was a frustrating conversation--
-For all of us.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.064
[Jason] On many levels.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.151
-[Davina] He's asking 75 million.
-Oh, my God.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.235
I know, I know.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.028
That's just so overpriced

12:18.112 --> 12:21.198
that we're just going to be
spinning our wheels spending money.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.701
-All we need is one client, you know? One.
-[Jason] No.

12:23.784 --> 12:27.204
That's almost embarrassing
for us to list it that high.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.789
I don't think it's embarrassing.

12:29.790 --> 12:33.461
And I wouldn't want to see us
back in that situation again

12:33.544 --> 12:35.296
on this house or any other.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.631
I don't want to be
in that situation again.

12:37.715 --> 12:41.552
[Jason] Yeah. Listen, it's definitely
something to think about.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.345
I've always liked you.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.432
It's just something
I kind of wanna think through, you know?

12:46.515 --> 12:50.102
It's not like I wanna set a precedent
for somebody leaving, then coming back.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.562
That I understand, yeah.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.315
But it's just…
I gotta run it by the team and everything.

Karan and I previously walked Doheny
during the day, and it was spectacular,

13:33.103 --> 13:36.941
but I wanted him to see the best version
of the house, at night during twilight.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.317
-Look at this.
-[Heather] I know.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.985
-This is spectacular.
-Isn't it insane?

13:40.069 --> 13:42.196
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-[Karan] Yeah.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.616
It actually gets even better
when you get further into the master.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.284
-As you walk down.
-Amazing.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.204
[Heather] Can you envision yourself here?
Anything you'd change?

13:50.287 --> 13:51.664
[Karan] You kidding? 100%.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.582
It's hard to say that, it's so beautiful.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.043
[energetic pop music playing]

13:56.126 --> 13:57.127
Stunning.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.672
So let's take this in.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.090
Now that it's dark inside,

14:01.173 --> 14:03.425
everything's moody and sexy.

14:03.509 --> 14:07.471
This is cool. I mean, it's so cool
how the master's the center of the house.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.390
It is. The center of the house.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.934
-Is there any complaints? Any worries?
-[Karan] No complaints.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.855
Actually, as I was pulling up,
I noticed the house next door is leveled.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.274
-The one right below you?
-[Karan] Yeah, the empty lot.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.526
-[Heather] Yeah.
-[Karan] So are they building?

14:20.609 --> 14:22.486
[Heather] Yes, they are gonna build.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.238
I don't know how high though.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.614
But the good thing is,

14:25.698 --> 14:27.825
in this area, there's a height ordinance,

14:27.908 --> 14:30.703
so I'm pretty sure
it's not gonna block your view.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.372
It might a little bit,
but I'm gonna call Jason

14:33.455 --> 14:36.792
and I'll find out if we can look into it
and find out the height.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.378
That'd be great.
That's definitely a concern.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.715
A big portion of this house is the view.
It's the main feature.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.509
So if it's gonna block the view,
it'll be an issue.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.344
Honestly, like, you… [sighs]

14:47.428 --> 14:49.930
As beautiful as this is,
if it's gonna be blocked,

14:50.014 --> 14:52.141
it's not the house for you,
and I know it's not.

-Irish treats, and I'm obsessed with it.
-Oh, those are good.

Only in Australia, Ireland, UK.

everyone's attention,

15:51.492 --> 15:54.954
um, let's start a team meeting,
hear what everyone's got going on.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.456
-[Chrishell] Team meeting.
-[Mary] Niko's ready.

You guys are so cute
over there, I must say.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.839
[Jason] Awesome.
That's what we're going for.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.383
I know! I figured! [laughs]

16:07.466 --> 16:09.718
Then we can hear
what everyone's got going on.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.345
The market's so hot right now.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.556
I have high expectations.
Chrishell, if you wanna start it off.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.809
Yeah. I'm excited. One of my clients,

16:16.892 --> 16:20.187
his name is Thomas Bryant,
he's a 23-year-old NBA player.

16:20.270 --> 16:24.400
He has all this money,
and he bought a house in Woodland Hills.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.403
This really beautiful kind of family home.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.614
Now that he's been there
for a little while, it's not his vibe.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.324
He wants, like, a bachelor pad,

16:32.408 --> 16:35.369
something sexier in the Hills,
so I'm gonna sell that house.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.205
I think it'll probably be around 3.5,

16:38.288 --> 16:41.375
then I'm gonna look to buy him
something up to four in the Hills.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.877
So you're selling his house,
and buying him a house.

16:43.961 --> 16:44.962
-Yes.
-[Brett] Awesome.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.589
-Amazing!
-That's what I'm working on now, so yay!

16:47.673 --> 16:49.008
Mary, you up.

16:49.091 --> 16:52.928
So for French Montana's house,
we've got so many showings lined up,

16:53.012 --> 16:55.806
um, tons and tons of interest on it,
so that's great.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.850
I actually just received an offer

16:57.933 --> 17:00.227
from a couple
that saw the property yesterday.

17:00.310 --> 17:01.854
-[all exclaim]
-That's amazing.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.565
Mary, when you close that deal,
because you will,

17:04.648 --> 17:08.986
you'll ring that bell
a million times because it's, like, wow!

17:09.069 --> 17:11.280
-I know. Yeah.
-Vanessa, you're up.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.740
I have my pocket in Malibu

17:12.823 --> 17:15.451
that I'm hoping
that it's gonna sell super soon,

17:15.534 --> 17:19.163
now that open houses are back,
and hopefully we'll put it on the market,

17:19.246 --> 17:21.206
so we can do that with that house.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.167
I'm also speaking to a buyer in Mexico.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.334
He's an investor.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.420
He's one of the owners of AT&amp;T.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.590
I sent him the one we went to see,
and he's interested in that one.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.759
Thank you, Vanessa. That's a good start.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.052
-Good job.
-[Vanessa] Thank you.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.220
Emma, this is your first.
What's your update?

17:35.304 --> 17:37.931
So I closed on Alesso's house for 6.3.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.600
-Nice.
-[all cheer]

17:39.683 --> 17:40.601
[Emma] Thank you.

17:40.684 --> 17:44.229
And then I have my client Patrick,
he's a billionaire from Singapore.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.356
-[Brett] I like this guy already.
-Right?

17:46.440 --> 17:50.444
He's flying in, and he actually
bought the house from Harry Styles.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.280
-We're listing that.
-Can I ask the important question?

17:53.363 --> 17:55.365
Did Harry Styles
leave anything in the house?

17:55.866 --> 17:58.118
Or does he ever come back and visit?

17:58.202 --> 18:00.746
-I don't even know. He's a…
-You don't know who that is?

18:00.829 --> 18:02.164
He's a singer or something.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.582
-What?
-[Jason] I've heard of him.

18:03.665 --> 18:06.043
-I just don't know where.
-I've heard the name.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.128
He was in that band One Direction.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.714
-He's, like, huge, big time.
-Huge.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.217
He sings the song "Watermelon,"
I think it's called?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.594
-[Emma laughs]
-[Chrishell] "Watermelon Sugar."

18:15.677 --> 18:18.972
But what is the point of watermelon sugar?
Like, what is that?

18:19.056 --> 18:19.973
I never got it.

18:20.057 --> 18:25.270
No, he's talking about, like,
how much he likes the taste of…

18:25.979 --> 18:28.607
the orchid of a woman. [laughs]

18:28.690 --> 18:31.193
I was wondering,
"What the heck is the watermelon?"

18:31.276 --> 18:33.153
[Amanza] And he likes the sugar?

18:33.237 --> 18:35.322
-Thank you, Chrishell, for explaining.
-I'm sorry.

18:35.405 --> 18:40.244
Anyway, I have a question for you guys,
because Davina has been reaching out.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.538
She has an interest
in rejoining the brokerage.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.791
I wanted to run that by you ladies
and see what you think about that.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.919
Obviously she left for a reason.
Did something happen?

18:49.002 --> 18:50.129
Is she not happy there?

18:50.212 --> 18:53.507
I think she was working
on a project over there that's done.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.967
She misses the brokerage.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.386
She did a lot of showings
for me when I was busy,

18:57.469 --> 18:58.804
and I was down in Newport.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.265
She helped me out,
and she was always professional.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.393
I always liked Davina.
I mean, I think she's… a tough woman.

19:04.476 --> 19:08.105
I think she says things
that maybe isn't the most positive,

19:08.188 --> 19:10.107
but I think she's been working on that.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.734
Her competence and professionality
aren't up for debate.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.736
It's whether you're comfortable with her.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.029
Where's she gonna sit?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.407
It gives me a little bit of nervousness.

19:18.490 --> 19:23.078
I obviously don't want to feel
any kind of, like, competition with me or…

19:23.162 --> 19:25.080
because that's not how I like to work.

19:25.164 --> 19:30.252
I always give people, like, you know,
the opportunity to be who they are.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.505
If they don't do anything to me, great,
but if they do something to me

19:33.589 --> 19:36.216
or someone that I love,
then it's not gonna be okay.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.509
I always got along with her.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.635
I thought she was great,

19:38.719 --> 19:41.889
but sometimes the stuff that came
out her mouth was just like, "Wait."

19:41.972 --> 19:43.473
[Maya] I do it too. I'm very direct.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.391
I ask questions,

19:44.474 --> 19:47.853
people can take it the wrong way,
but I don't mean to hurt them,

19:47.936 --> 19:49.730
so I don't think she realizes that.

19:49.813 --> 19:53.066
She doesn't do it to be vindictive.
She does it because that's who she is.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.526
Well, isn't that worse?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.862
From what I'm hearing,
she just doesn't sound

19:56.945 --> 19:58.447
like a super positive person,

19:58.530 --> 20:00.782
and I genuinely think
all of these girls are,

20:00.866 --> 20:02.534
and that we make a great group,

20:02.618 --> 20:05.787
but I obviously don't know
everything that went down.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.788
-So…
-[Mary] Yeah.

20:06.872 --> 20:13.212
I think the most recent thing,
she was beyond rude to Chrishell.

20:13.295 --> 20:17.174
Chrishell, to be fair,
we don't know any details.

20:17.257 --> 20:20.052
Obviously, Justin has his own side, right?

20:20.135 --> 20:22.262
-Can we stop?
-That's all I'm saying.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.765
He didn't get married
to get divorced, you know?

20:25.390 --> 20:26.808
You know that, right?

20:29.728 --> 20:33.649
Well, I just… Obviously, that night was…
There was a lot of emotions anyways.

20:33.732 --> 20:37.152
I was trying to get through the night,
so I just wasn't ready to even…

20:37.236 --> 20:39.154
And so I was really thrown off guard.

20:39.238 --> 20:44.660
For me, it would've gone a long way
if she'd, like, apologized after that.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.620
-So she never reached out?
-[Chrishell] No.

20:46.703 --> 20:50.290
My relationship with Davina
since Christine's wedding

20:50.374 --> 20:51.583
hasn't really changed.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.168
We haven't spoken or anything,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.337
and to kick someone when they're down

20:55.420 --> 20:57.965
is just something
that you really should never do,

20:58.048 --> 21:01.635
and, obviously,
it was painful at the time.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.012
A lot of time has gone by.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.599
I don't really hold a grudge,
but I do hold people accountable.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.809
There's a difference.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.270
When I was there,
I don't remember it happening

21:11.937 --> 21:13.272
that aggressive, so--

21:13.355 --> 21:14.564
Well, I fucking do.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.692
I don't think she meant it that bad,

21:16.775 --> 21:20.237
but if I would say, "Of course,
nobody gets married to get divorced,"

21:20.320 --> 21:23.573
maybe I sound more gentle than,
"Nobody gets married to get divorced."

21:23.657 --> 21:25.409
[Chrishell] If that's all, it's one thing.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.535
She was taunting me,

21:26.618 --> 21:29.162
trying to get me to talk
when I clearly was shutting down,

21:29.246 --> 21:30.539
trying to get through the night.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.749
So I'm sorry, I have to disagree.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.501
-It was rough.
-It was a huge moment.

21:34.584 --> 21:35.919
I even said something to her.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.589
[Mary] It was a really bad night.
She just had to get up and leave.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.968
Like, "I can't do this anymore."
It was too much.

21:43.051 --> 21:47.264
[Maya] Chrishell, you think you're ready
to put this, obviously, in the past?

21:47.347 --> 21:51.393
-Maybe you guys can talk, hash things out.
-[Chrishell] I would prefer not to.

21:51.476 --> 21:55.314
If she felt like she should've apologized,
she would have already,

21:55.397 --> 21:58.233
so if she does it now,
it'll seem fake, and I don't need that.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.111
You know, she left
so if she wants to come back,

22:01.194 --> 22:03.488
I feel like she has to play by the rules.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.824
She can't make
those snide comments all the time,

22:05.907 --> 22:10.704
and just kind of, you know,
bring her air of negativity.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.831
-Hurtful things.
-[Chrishell] They hurt your feelings.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.916
You they can act like they don't,
but they do.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.294
I think she's a good agent, you know,

22:17.836 --> 22:20.672
but I think she comes
with some baggage in that respect.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.924
We will have more discussions about this.

22:23.008 --> 22:26.636
I'm not gonna make any decision
that would affect this family dynamic

22:26.720 --> 22:29.097
without involving you all, so…

22:29.181 --> 22:31.433
Maybe just… she's not allowed to talk.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.102
-That would work.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.790

27:02.829 --> 27:04.581
It's you. You will do it. [laughs]

27:04.664 --> 27:05.498
Thank you.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.876
Do you know anyone else
that might be interested

27:07.959 --> 27:09.628
in writing an offer on that house?

27:09.711 --> 27:14.716
Um, well, I showed it to my client Lenny,
and he seemed pretty interested.

27:14.799 --> 27:15.925
[Brett] It's a start.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.969
Yeah. You guys happen to know anybody

27:18.053 --> 27:22.349
that might want
a gorgeous Tuscan villa in Calabasas?

27:22.432 --> 27:25.644
Now that I'm thinking about it,
I have a new client, actually,

27:25.727 --> 27:26.811
who's on the Lakers.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.647
He might want it.

27:28.730 --> 27:33.026
Six bedrooms,
um, a guesthouse, super high ceilings.

27:33.109 --> 27:36.321
Good. He's nice and tall.
I don't know the exact height, but tall.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.990
That could be a really good fit.
I'll take him by.

27:39.074 --> 27:42.369
Okay. Yeah, give me his availability,
and I'll get you in right away.

27:42.452 --> 27:45.538
-[Emma] Perfect. I'll text him right now.
-Look at that.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.374
-[Mary] I love it.
-Yeah! [laughs]

27:47.457 --> 27:49.626
-Saved the day, Emma.
-Yes. Fingers crossed.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.170
-She's a real go-getter, that Emma.
-I know, right?

27:52.253 --> 27:53.421
[Emma] Yeah, that newbie.

You are so old.

a birthday party for Niko and Zelda.

Niko's turning 15,
and Zelda's turning four,

28:46.808 --> 28:49.144
and so we are just going to give them

28:49.227 --> 28:52.605
the biggest, best birthday party
that they could ever ask for.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.275
Mmm! Is it your birthday?

28:56.651 --> 28:58.695
-[Brett] You got 'em Tiffany's gifts?
-Yes.

Hi!

29:52.499 --> 29:55.251
Hi! Oh, my God!

29:55.335 --> 29:58.087
-I can make you a mocktail.
-[Maya] I want a mocktail.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.340
-[Tarek] Dude, this view.
-[Brett] Right?

30:00.423 --> 30:01.257
[Tarek] My God.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.301
[Brett] We have this
on the market for 8 million.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.970
-But it's as a teardown.
-[Tarek] Wow, look at that.

30:06.554 --> 30:07.889
Where do we get the drinks?

30:07.972 --> 30:09.974
-Cheers.
-Chrishell made me a mocktail.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.726
-I want one.
-This is the Salty Dog.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.604
This the Niko.
There's also the Zelda, which is rosé.

30:14.687 --> 30:15.730

-Make it a double!
-Okay.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.693
I didn't say a double.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.862
-I gotta behave a little bit.
-All right.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.572
Yeah. Behave, behave.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.241
[Amanza laughs] Oh, my God!

30:26.825 --> 30:29.536
This is a bigger party
than I have for myself!

30:29.619 --> 30:31.412
-Hot mama.
-[Chrishell] Get over here.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.997
-Hi!
-Yeah!

30:34.958 --> 30:35.834
[Mary] Hey, babe.

30:35.917 --> 30:39.254
Are you trying to get up on the table
and get food? Are you hungry?

30:39.921 --> 30:41.631
[Emma] I saw you guys went out last night.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.466
[Maya] Yes. Was me, Davina, and Christine.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.302
[Emma] What do you think of Davina?
I know that, obviously,

30:46.386 --> 30:48.972
everyone kind of said
not the nicest things about her,

30:49.055 --> 30:52.475
from her being there before,
and, obviously, I wasn't there for that.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.018
She's actually really nice.

30:54.102 --> 30:57.814
Yeah, she comments here and there,
and she's obviously very direct,

30:57.897 --> 31:00.441
and maybe almost sometimes too direct,

31:00.525 --> 31:04.654
so I think some of the comments she made
come across, I guess, insensitive.

31:04.737 --> 31:07.949
But, you know, she's not a mean person.

31:08.032 --> 31:11.995
Has she ever had, like, a boyfriend
or, like, a significant other?

31:12.078 --> 31:14.247
Yeah, she had a couple
of serious relationships.

31:14.330 --> 31:18.084
Okay. I just wonder, if you haven't been
in a super serious relationship,

31:18.167 --> 31:20.420
you don't understand
some things are sensitive.

31:20.503 --> 31:23.673
-Who are you talking about? Is it private?
-No! Come in!

31:23.756 --> 31:25.633
So, yesterday, Davina was telling me,

31:25.717 --> 31:28.177
apparently, she was married too,
and she got divorced.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.305
-[Emma] She was?
-She was married, yeah.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.265
After four years, and he cheated on her…

31:32.348 --> 31:35.935
Actually, the woman
showed up in their house, and…

31:36.019 --> 31:37.937
-[Emma] Oh, wow.
-Pretty bad story, yeah.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.691
That must be so nice that it was private,
and no one knew, and no one asked her.

31:41.774 --> 31:44.235
So that must have been nice.

31:44.319 --> 31:47.447
[Chrishell] Never in my life
would I ever speak to somebody

31:47.530 --> 31:48.656
the way that she did.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.409
And to now know
that she also went through a divorce,

31:51.492 --> 31:52.994
it just makes everything worse.

31:53.077 --> 31:57.415
I don't think Jason should have her back,
but that's not my call.

31:57.498 --> 32:01.127
Sometimes, you have to think twice
or three times before you say something.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.795
I have sometimes the same problem.

32:02.879 --> 32:06.090
I think the difference is
your intention comes through,

32:06.174 --> 32:07.842
where hers does not.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.678
It did not come through
that she was coming from a good place.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.181
It came through
like she was getting enjoyment.

32:13.264 --> 32:18.353
There's certain girls that, like, feed off
of something negative happening.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.688
-"Misery likes company" kind of thing?
-Yeah, exactly.

32:20.772 --> 32:21.606
Yeah.

32:21.689 --> 32:26.069
Knowing that she went through
the same thing is a little shocking, but…

32:27.195 --> 32:29.030
[woman] Top step. There you go.

32:29.614 --> 32:33.952
Okay, guys, so I wrote a poem
for Niko and a poem for Zelda.

32:34.035 --> 32:39.874
And also, Niko and Zelda donated $5,000
to the Burbank Animal Shelter today.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.834
-Yay!
-[all applaud]

32:41.918 --> 32:44.629
[Jason] Which is where
Chrishell got little Gracie.

32:44.712 --> 32:47.006
Gracie! Whoo!

32:47.090 --> 32:49.592
-[Jason] Okay, so, to my poem.
-[whispers indistinctly]

32:49.676 --> 32:52.929
Niko, at the age of 15
You're all grown up

32:53.012 --> 32:55.056
Gone are the days of you as a pup

32:55.640 --> 32:58.393
You teach me about life every single day

32:58.476 --> 33:01.270
In the little things you do
To show me the way

33:01.771 --> 33:04.482
You're one of a kind
A dog beyond his years

33:05.066 --> 33:07.652
My love for you
It could bring me to tears

33:07.735 --> 33:10.113
Every day together brings me so much joy

33:10.196 --> 33:12.407
I love you always, Niko, you're my boy

33:12.490 --> 33:14.575
[all] Aw!

33:14.659 --> 33:17.578

33:18.788 --> 33:20.623
[Jason] Now for little Zelly.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.334
Did I really cry at a dog poem?
That's ridiculous.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.170
Zelda, your mom and I, we love you a ton

33:26.671 --> 33:28.965
We want you to play and lounge in the sun

33:29.048 --> 33:29.882
[people chuckle]

33:29.966 --> 33:32.927
But you're a big girl now
You just turned four

33:33.011 --> 33:35.179
So why do we still find poop on the floor?

33:35.263 --> 33:36.723
[all laugh]

33:37.807 --> 33:40.643
It's not that I care
About your poop or your pee

33:40.727 --> 33:43.396
It's that you do it at Mary's
And then she blames me

33:43.479 --> 33:44.939
[all laughing]

33:46.274 --> 33:49.986
So, for now, my lecture is done
I don't want to dampen your fun

33:50.695 --> 33:53.281
Your big ears are so soft to the touch

33:53.364 --> 33:55.491
You're my little girl
And I love you so much

33:55.575 --> 33:56.617

[Emma] Oh, my gosh. So sweet.

34:02.665 --> 34:05.418
-[Jason] I wrote it.
-[Maya] You did? That's awesome.

34:05.501 --> 34:08.796

Zelly and Niko, we love you a lot.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.466

I didn't crash her baby shower.

[Christine] Hey, Mary, Chrishell.
Hey, guys!

34:55.593 --> 34:57.386
-[Heather] Gee, hi.
-Hi, baby girl!

34:57.470 --> 34:59.639
You want me to protect you?
You want to hide?

34:59.722 --> 35:03.267
Are you kidding me?
I have a camel toe the size of Texas.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.521
-You had a baby, uh, two days ago.
-[laughs]

35:06.604 --> 35:09.941
-You look like… Like, I can't.
-Oh, my God.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.235
-I need to give you a hug.
-I'm offended.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.237
I love you, but I'm offended.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.613
[Mary] Who invited her?

35:15.696 --> 35:19.826
I am angry
that Christine ended up showing up.

35:19.909 --> 35:24.205
I don't want this to be about her.
She always makes everything about her.

35:24.288 --> 35:26.290
This is not okay.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.293
I wonder why she's here,
'cause no one invited her.

35:29.877 --> 35:33.506
-Did Jason invite her?
-[Mary] No. I saw the guest list.

35:33.589 --> 35:35.633
I don't want drama.
I knew Emma would be here.

35:35.716 --> 35:40.930
I knew a lot of people don't…
And she didn't want me at her thing, fine.

35:41.013 --> 35:43.141
I don't know why, but things are not good,

35:43.224 --> 35:46.227
and if things are not good,
then I don't want someone here.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.188
This is my dogs' party.
It's not about me. Like, the dogs.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.189
Why is she…

35:50.857 --> 35:52.733
She doesn't get along
with half the people.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.361
-[Vanessa] How's the little boy?
-He's so good.

35:55.444 --> 35:58.739
It was nice to get away.
I'm like, "I get to go to a party."

35:58.823 --> 36:01.200
So Christian's at home.
I'm like, "This is great."

36:01.284 --> 36:03.411
If she's mean to you,
I'll be like, "Sorry,

36:03.494 --> 36:05.705
we were supposed
to take invitations at the door."

36:05.788 --> 36:07.915
-"Can I please see yours?"
-[laughs]

36:07.999 --> 36:11.544
Last thing I need is her coming in
and attacking someone at my party.

36:11.627 --> 36:14.338
-[Heather] How are you doing?
-[Jason] A little buzzed.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.841
[Maya] Jason, the speech
for the dogs was perfect.

36:16.924 --> 36:19.635
-[Heather] So cute, Jason.
-[Maya] It was really cute.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.888
-[Heather] Did you invite Christine?
-[Jason] I did.

36:21.971 --> 36:22.930
[Heather] You did?

36:23.014 --> 36:26.058
-Mary's a little upset, yeah.
-[Emma] Mary said you didn't!

36:26.726 --> 36:27.935
[Romain] Jason invited her.

36:28.019 --> 36:28.853
No, he didn't.

36:28.936 --> 36:31.480
-Yes, I did.
-[Mary] Are you kidding me?

36:31.564 --> 36:35.651
I would never be okay with this,
and I'm not gonna go along with this.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.861
-[Jason] Thank you.
-Okay?

36:37.820 --> 36:40.323
I've had tequila,
so I can finally fucking speak up.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.743
[Jason] Mary! Mary. Mary?

36:45.953 --> 36:47.413
Mary, Mary!

36:48.080 --> 36:49.749
Why does Mary look pissed?

36:50.833 --> 36:53.878
[Jason] This is your kids' birthday party.

36:53.961 --> 36:58.507
[Mary] Yes, which is why I asked
not to have drama here.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.760
-[Christine] Why would Mary be mad?
-I don't know.

37:00.843 --> 37:04.180
-[Vanessa] Do you know what happened?
-I think she was upset at Jason.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.556
This is our dogs' birthday.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.059
We spent a lot of money.
We've put a lot of effort in.

37:08.142 --> 37:10.186
-[Jason] Yeah.
-We don't want the drama here.

37:10.269 --> 37:13.481
-If she wants drama, do it at the office.
-[Jason] She's not gonna start drama.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.611
OMG, OMG.
