(SNORING)

00:13.724 --> 00:15.136
Cyd, wake up.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.100
Cyd, wake up.

00:20.601 --> 00:24.145
Cyd, wake up!

00:25.276 --> 00:26.817
(SNORES)

00:26.817 --> 00:27.818
Really?

00:31.782 --> 00:33.284
(GRUNTS)

00:35.996 --> 00:38.159
Cyd, I think
you fell out of bed.

00:39.580 --> 00:42.293
Shelby, if you woke me up
before the alarm went off...

00:42.293 --> 00:43.294
I didn't.
 (BEEPING)

00:44.215 --> 00:45.216
Okay, I did.

00:46.967 --> 00:48.469
I just couldn't sleep.

00:48.469 --> 00:51.842
I'm so excited
that my best friend
is living with me forever.

00:51.842 --> 00:56.016
Well, just until my parents
get back from their
archeological dig in Peru.

00:56.016 --> 00:59.100
Well, yeah,
but that's gonna be,
like, three years.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.182
Unless they get entombed.
Then it will be forever.

01:01.182 --> 01:02.733
(GASPS) Was it bad
that I said that?

01:04.525 --> 01:06.277
I just love that
you're staying here.

01:06.277 --> 01:08.399
I love it, too.
Which is why
I haven't zipped you

01:08.399 --> 01:10.821
inside my heavy bag
for waking me up
in the morning.

01:10.821 --> 01:11.822
(YELLS)

01:13.614 --> 01:15.326
You say scary
things sometimes.

01:15.326 --> 01:16.827
You love it
when I say scary
things sometimes.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.410
Well, you're just
so good at it.
 I am good at it.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.412
It's pretty cool
your parents are
letting me stay here.

01:21.412 --> 01:24.625
Well, of course, they are.
They love you.
My whole family loves you.

01:24.625 --> 01:26.337
Your brothers
definitely love me.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.879
Did you see this
video they sent me?

01:28.879 --> 01:31.172
These flowers
 are for you, Cyd.

01:31.172 --> 01:32.843
I'm giving her
flowers, Chet.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.715
No, I'm giving
her flowers, Brett.

01:36.427 --> 01:37.678
(GRUNTS)

01:40.351 --> 01:43.854
Well, aside from that,
me and Diesel are
gonna be real happy here.

01:43.854 --> 01:47.148
Yeah, don't you think
Diesel would be happier
living outside?

01:48.108 --> 01:49.320
(GROWLING)

01:53.654 --> 01:55.366
We can't let him
hit the streets.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.867
He'll fall right back
into the thug life.

01:58.539 --> 02:00.501
Hey, I was thinking

02:00.501 --> 02:03.334
maybe we could put up
some of my stuff, you know,

02:03.334 --> 02:06.747
make my side of the room
a little more me.

02:09.419 --> 02:11.962
Wow! Uh, yeah,

02:11.962 --> 02:14.515
maybe we can put
zom-bozo up later.

02:14.515 --> 02:16.517
Or never.

02:16.517 --> 02:19.600
MOM: Girls, time to get
your Monday on!
 Coming, Mom!

02:19.600 --> 02:21.182
Hurry up,
let's get to school.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.973
I'm asking Cameron
to the dance today.

02:22.973 --> 02:26.687
I put together one of my big,
crazy, elaborate plans.

02:26.687 --> 02:28.899
You know how I love to do
things big, right, Cyd?

02:28.899 --> 02:29.900
(SNORES)

02:33.404 --> 02:34.485
Really?

02:37.538 --> 02:40.331
I'm so hungry.
If I don't get some food
in me right now,

02:40.331 --> 02:42.082
my stomach's gonna
take me out back

02:42.082 --> 02:43.454
and beat me
with a phone book.

02:45.336 --> 02:46.787
No, we have to hurry.

02:46.787 --> 02:48.249
If my brothers
hear us they'll...

02:48.249 --> 02:49.250
Ow!

02:50.881 --> 02:52.843
Cyd, because
you're so special...

02:52.843 --> 02:54.134
We wanted to say...

02:55.886 --> 02:58.138
"Yo Rick?" Who's Rick?

02:58.138 --> 02:59.760
Yours was supposed
to say "you."

02:59.760 --> 03:01.932
And yours was
supposed to say "rock."

03:01.932 --> 03:03.183
You ruined it, Chet!

03:03.183 --> 03:04.895
No, you ruined it, Brett!

03:12.863 --> 03:15.025
But I didn't get
to have breakfast.

03:15.025 --> 03:17.077
We have to
stop by Barry's lab
on the way to school.

03:17.077 --> 03:18.819
He's helping me
ask Cameron
to the dance.

03:18.819 --> 03:21.322
I probably should've
mentioned this before
I moved in with you,

03:21.322 --> 03:26.036
but I have this weird
condition where
I need to eat.

03:26.036 --> 03:28.999
No time. Barry,
open up, it's us!

03:30.331 --> 03:31.292
Smell this.

03:32.293 --> 03:33.424
BOTH: Ugh!
 Nasty!

03:33.424 --> 03:35.636
Yes, it is.
Now smell this.

03:35.636 --> 03:37.388
BOTH: Ugh!
 What are you doing?

03:37.388 --> 03:39.390
A behavioral study
to see if people
will continue

03:39.390 --> 03:41.552
to smell things after the
first thing smells terrible.

03:41.552 --> 03:44.765
Here, smell this.
 Ugh, why did I do that?

03:44.765 --> 03:46.186
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.481
Hey, guys!
 BOTH: Hey, Naldo.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.942
Check out our new
chest hair machine!

03:51.942 --> 03:53.814
It's not a chest hair
machine, Renaldo.

03:53.814 --> 03:57.117
It's an experiment
to cure baldness
using accelerated photons

03:57.117 --> 04:00.951
in a quantized
fermion field to stimulate
follicular generation.

04:00.951 --> 04:03.163
I'm sorry to dumb it down,
I'm not trying
to patronize you.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.497
But you said
if I point it
at my chest,

04:06.497 --> 04:07.628
it'll give me
chest hair.

04:07.628 --> 04:09.500
I said, "Don't point it
at your chest,

04:09.500 --> 04:10.671
"or it will give you
chest hair."

04:10.671 --> 04:11.832
But what if I want
chest hair?

04:11.832 --> 04:12.963
Why would you
want chest hair?

04:14.084 --> 04:15.506
So I can shave it.

04:17.047 --> 04:19.339
Barry, I thought you
were working on
my big plan

04:19.339 --> 04:21.552
to ask Cameron
to the dance.
 And I am.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.224
I've rigged everything
so that at exactly 8:46
this morning,

04:24.224 --> 04:25.976
the school's P.A.
system will blast

04:25.976 --> 04:27.097
Cameron's favorite
music...

04:27.097 --> 04:28.349
Fist-pumping-jaw-droppers.

04:31.392 --> 04:33.484
The vents will flood
the hall

04:33.484 --> 04:34.695
with his favorite
smell...

04:34.695 --> 04:36.357
Fist-pumping-jaw-dropper
body spray.

04:40.361 --> 04:43.073
And finally the
Pep Squad's confetti
cannons will go off

04:43.073 --> 04:45.456
as the school's digital
projector poses the query,

04:45.456 --> 04:47.618
"Will you go to
the dance with me?"

04:47.618 --> 04:48.709
All you have to do
is stand in front

04:48.709 --> 04:49.830
of Cameron's locker
when it happens.

04:49.830 --> 04:51.962
My part's feeling
kinda simple.

04:51.962 --> 04:54.124
Yes, well, we scientists
like to limit

04:54.124 --> 04:57.257
the number of
unstable variables,
or what we call "people."

04:58.629 --> 05:00.721
NALDO:
Barry, I think it's working!

05:00.721 --> 05:03.133
(WHIRRING)

05:03.133 --> 05:06.637
That machine is not
supposed to make
your chest emit smoke.

05:06.637 --> 05:08.188
What if I want my chest
to emit smoke?

05:08.188 --> 05:09.810
Why would you want
your chest to emit smoke?

05:11.141 --> 05:12.312
'Cause it looks cool.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.065
Ooh, somebody's
barbecue-ing.

05:17.197 --> 05:18.699
That would be you.

05:20.941 --> 05:22.863
Ugh, I'm starving.

05:22.863 --> 05:25.035
Barry's gotta have
something to eat
around here.

05:25.035 --> 05:27.077
This plan to ask Cameron
is gonna work, right?

05:27.077 --> 05:28.409
I mean, it's gotta work.

05:28.409 --> 05:30.661
It's got everything
a great love story has.

05:30.661 --> 05:33.584
Music, confetti, body spray.

05:36.507 --> 05:38.128
Oh, no. What's that?

05:41.051 --> 05:42.052
(CRACKLING)

05:47.468 --> 05:48.469
(SCREAMING)

05:54.815 --> 05:56.687
What was that?

05:56.687 --> 05:58.529
The Chest Hair
Machine just...

05:58.529 --> 05:59.530
BOTH: Chest hair!

06:00.901 --> 06:01.982
I'm good. You?

06:01.982 --> 06:03.153
No more than
I came in with.

06:04.575 --> 06:05.866
Phew.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.409

maybe that laser
did something to us.

I was so close!

07:37.578 --> 07:39.129
SHELBY: Look!
There's Cameron!

07:39.129 --> 07:41.461
He's so interesting
to talk to.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.503
Probably.
I don't care.

07:43.794 --> 07:45.716
Cyd, I know what
you're thinking.

07:45.716 --> 07:47.508
Chimichangas.
 Wow, I was way off.

07:49.179 --> 07:51.762
Will you instead
accept one of
my best friend speeches?

"that nothing is going
to get in the way
of our friendship."

08:00.731 --> 08:02.102
So if I'm to
understand you correctly,

08:02.102 --> 08:04.404
there is no
chimichangas?

08:06.196 --> 08:07.658

08:11.742 --> 08:13.704
I have to go stand
in front of Cameron's locker
like Barry said.

08:13.704 --> 08:15.536
Hey ya, Shelby!
Got a minute?

08:15.536 --> 08:16.707
Actually it's gonna
take more than a minute.

08:16.707 --> 08:18.959
I have no concept of time.
I'm like a dog that way.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.671
I also sleep at the foot
of my parents' bed,

08:20.671 --> 08:22.793
which is another way
I'm like a dog.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.715
Marci, I don't have
time for this!

08:24.715 --> 08:26.466
I got you. Go.

08:26.466 --> 08:28.218

how I learned

08:28.218 --> 08:30.591
I have a severe

Gosh, your skin is healthy!

08:32.182 --> 08:33.933
I just wanna lick it.

BARRY: Cyd.

08:36.597 --> 08:40.190
When I returned to my lab,
I couldn't help but notice
you destroyed my laser.

08:40.190 --> 08:42.062
Yeah, Shelby said
we should leave
a note.

08:42.062 --> 08:44.354
But I was all,
"He'll know it was us. "

Hey! Confetti, music, a sign.

09:02.372 --> 09:05.215
Solid ask.
I would totally
say yes to that!

09:06.717 --> 09:09.800
No! Cameron! Wait!

09:09.800 --> 09:13.383
Cyd, when that laser
blasted Renaldo,
it was set at two.

09:13.383 --> 09:15.846
You guys were
blasted at 400.

09:17.517 --> 09:18.979
There's no telling
what could've happened.

09:18.979 --> 09:20.851
It could have
sent you to
another dimension

09:20.851 --> 09:23.143
or made you time travel
or rendered you invisible!

09:25.686 --> 09:26.687
You're not invisible.

09:28.899 --> 09:31.822
Everything went wrong.
I didn't even get to ask him.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.153
Aw, Shelby,
that bites.

09:33.694 --> 09:35.656
I'm sorry.

09:35.656 --> 09:37.698
I never should have
gotten out of bed
this morning.

09:41.251 --> 09:42.753

in my bedroom?

Is it this morning again?

No. No, no, no.
That is not possible!

09:55.135 --> 09:57.307
MOM: Girls, time
to get your Monday on!

09:57.307 --> 10:00.100
It is possible.
I think we just
time traveled!

10:01.101 --> 10:02.102
(SCREAMING)

10:10.731 --> 10:12.402
This can't be happening!

10:12.402 --> 10:14.284
It's just some
sort of weird
joint nightmare,

10:14.284 --> 10:15.405
but during the day.

10:15.405 --> 10:16.997
Like a daymare?
 Exactly! A daymare.

10:16.997 --> 10:19.740
There's no such thing
as a daymare!

10:19.740 --> 10:21.501
Well, there has to be!
Because otherwise
that means

10:21.501 --> 10:23.163
we're really back
to this morning!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.958
Wait, Barry said
the laser that
that blasted us

10:27.958 --> 10:29.840
could make us
time travel.
Or invisible.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.885
You're not invisible.
 We time traveled!

10:34.885 --> 10:35.886
Wait.

10:37.307 --> 10:38.558
Let's think about this.

10:38.558 --> 10:40.520
Maybe this is a good thing.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.933
We get to do
today over again.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.975
We can fix everything
that went wrong.

10:44.975 --> 10:47.437
I can re-ask
Cameron to the dance!

10:47.437 --> 10:48.859
I can put on underwear!

10:52.272 --> 10:53.944
Come on, let's get to school!

10:56.987 --> 10:58.949
Ow. Our bodies!

11:00.660 --> 11:02.082
You spelled rock wrong.

11:03.543 --> 11:05.375
How'd she know that?

11:06.086 --> 11:07.627
Who the heck is Rick?

11:09.459 --> 11:11.381
Time travel's the best.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.150
Why did you think
the vending machine

11:30.150 --> 11:31.481
was going to take
your dollar this time?

11:31.481 --> 11:34.274
We can time travel
and that's what's bumping you?

11:36.656 --> 11:38.198
Okay. I'm gonna go
get in position.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.410
I am not messing things up
with Cameron this time.

11:40.410 --> 11:42.032
Hey ya, Shelby!
 Oh, no.

11:43.123 --> 11:44.785
I got you! Go!

11:44.785 --> 11:47.247
So Marci, my girl,

11:47.247 --> 11:48.959
do you have
a flat dollar bill?

11:48.959 --> 11:50.921
I'm talking
vending machine flat.

11:52.252 --> 11:55.425
Sure do.
My grandpappy
gave it to me.

11:55.425 --> 11:57.758
It's the only thing
I have left to
remember him by.

11:57.758 --> 11:58.839
Great, thanks.

11:59.890 --> 12:01.261
(MUSIC PLAYING)

12:01.261 --> 12:02.512
(SCREAMS)

12:02.512 --> 12:04.434
(GRUNTS)
 (SCREAMS)

12:09.689 --> 12:12.062
The dance, huh?
Solid ask.

12:12.062 --> 12:13.403
I'm in.

12:15.565 --> 12:16.947
Well, that's not good.

12:18.909 --> 12:20.861
That was my
"solid ask. I'm in"!

12:20.861 --> 12:23.073
I can't believe this!
 Shelby, calm down.

12:23.073 --> 12:25.455
I mean, this is
kind of funny when
you think about it.

12:25.455 --> 12:28.538
I'm sure some day
in the future...

12:28.538 --> 12:30.871
...we'll look back
at this and laugh.
(LAUGHS)

12:43.383 --> 12:45.225
You said "Some day
in the future"

12:45.225 --> 12:47.387
and I think we're
in the future now!

12:47.387 --> 12:49.149
Hey, maybe
that's how it works.

12:49.149 --> 12:50.941
We think of a time,
and we travel there.

12:50.941 --> 12:52.602
So if we wanna go back,

12:52.602 --> 12:54.194
we just have to think.
Back to before.

12:54.194 --> 12:55.355
Nope.
 Back to before.

12:55.355 --> 12:56.696
Uh-uh.
 Back to before.

12:56.696 --> 12:58.819
Still here.
 Time travel is so hard!

13:00.240 --> 13:01.902
You guys are
talking again?

13:01.902 --> 13:04.034
You haven't talked
to each other
in two years.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.246
It was the same day
I lost my grandpappy's
lucky dollar.

13:06.246 --> 13:09.579
Oh, just take it back.

13:09.579 --> 13:13.583
If we're here,
where's the future us who
hasn't talked in two years?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.011
I think we are future us!

13:21.011 --> 13:23.183
This must be how we
looked to everyone.

13:23.183 --> 13:27.017
When we time travel,
we enter our bodies
from that time.

13:27.017 --> 13:28.598
This is a disaster!

13:28.598 --> 13:30.690
Why didn't you
stop me from
getting bangs?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.434
Because you've hated
each other ever
since the day

13:34.434 --> 13:36.026
Cyd asked Cameron
to the dance.

13:36.026 --> 13:37.988
I didn't ask him!
 Well, he thought
you did!

13:37.988 --> 13:39.569
But I would
never go with him!

13:39.569 --> 13:42.032
Of course not.
'Cause Shelby said
you weren't allowed.

13:42.032 --> 13:43.403
Not allowed?

13:43.403 --> 13:44.945
And then you told Shelby
that she was too controlling.

13:44.945 --> 13:46.867
When have I ever
been controlling?

13:46.867 --> 13:48.328
You dragged me
out of bed,

13:48.328 --> 13:49.870
you wouldn't let me
eat breakfast.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.711
Oh, come on,
you're not mad
about that.

13:51.711 --> 13:53.713
Now you're telling me
what I'm mad about!

13:53.713 --> 13:55.505
Ooh, it's gettin' real.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.959
You won't let me
unpack my stuff!

13:58.959 --> 14:00.840
You won't even let me
hang my poster!

14:00.840 --> 14:04.134
Well, I'm sorry I don't
want Zom-Bozo staring
at me while I sleep!

14:04.134 --> 14:06.056
Well, I find him soothing!

14:06.056 --> 14:08.268
Now it's gettin'
really real.

14:09.639 --> 14:10.891
It's my room!

14:10.891 --> 14:12.352
I thought
it was our room!

14:12.352 --> 14:14.524
I never realized
how selfish you are!

14:14.524 --> 14:17.187
I'm selfish.
Because I don't want
to live with a slob.

14:17.187 --> 14:20.320
Well, maybe this slob
doesn't want to live
with an uptight scrunch!

14:21.982 --> 14:24.194
Yo, I am having
major deja vu here.

14:24.194 --> 14:26.246
This is exactly what
happened two years ago

14:26.246 --> 14:27.908
when you and Cyd
stopped being friends.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.750
You remember,
the day you and I
became best friends

14:30.750 --> 14:32.122
and made up our
secret handshake.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.453
I'm pretty sure
we don't have a...

14:36.416 --> 14:37.707
How do I know this?

14:38.959 --> 14:41.001
And why did we
make it so long?

14:48.138 --> 14:51.011
I can't believe
Cyd and I got into
such a big fight.

14:51.011 --> 14:52.682
We've never
fought like that.

14:52.682 --> 14:54.224
I'm surprised
you're still so mad

14:54.224 --> 14:55.936
she stole Cameron from you.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.018
It's not about Cameron.

14:58.018 --> 15:00.230
I mean, yes,
I wanted to go to
the dance with him

15:00.230 --> 15:02.192
because he's cute
and cares about
the environment

15:02.192 --> 15:03.783
just enough to be
socially conscious

15:03.783 --> 15:05.525
but not so much where
he's annoying about it.

15:07.988 --> 15:10.080
But Cyd didn't mean
to get that date.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.491
It was a total accident.

15:11.491 --> 15:12.912
Then why were
you fighting?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.414
Because I wanted
to do things my way,

15:14.414 --> 15:16.496
and Cyd wanted to
do things her way.

15:16.496 --> 15:18.588
It's been going on
ever since she moved in.

15:18.588 --> 15:20.880
I've always wondered
why you two
were friends anyway.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.212
You're so different.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.753
I mean, Cyd likes
to sleep late.

15:23.753 --> 15:25.545
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, she does.

15:25.545 --> 15:28.098
She'd miss school
if I didn't drag her
out of bed.

15:28.098 --> 15:29.970
I loved the feeling
of her dead weight
in my arms.

15:31.601 --> 15:33.313
She's a crank
when she gets hungry.

15:33.313 --> 15:35.225
It's really
the vending
machine's fault.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.147
I mean, she put
the dollar in.

15:37.147 --> 15:38.518
What else
could she do?

15:39.689 --> 15:41.231
I just don't get it.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.193
The fact that we're so
different has always been

15:43.193 --> 15:45.615
what's made us so
perfect for each other.

15:45.615 --> 15:47.277
You know,
I'm no psychologist

15:47.277 --> 15:49.239
but my sister's cousin is.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.530
A person who's met one.

15:52.122 --> 15:56.206
And she thinks that
you being so different
is why Cyd moved out.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.248
Cyd moved out?
 Of course.

15:58.248 --> 16:01.291
After that fight of yours,
she moved in
with another friend.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.213
Oh, we talked about this
two years ago,

16:03.213 --> 16:05.795
but it sure is fun
reliving good times.

16:07.347 --> 16:09.589
I can't believe
I let things go so far.

16:09.589 --> 16:11.141
I've got to find Cyd.

16:11.141 --> 16:14.014
This was a terrible mistake.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.307
So you're saying
our best friendship
is built on a mistake?

16:18.268 --> 16:19.859
'Cause I can
live with that.

16:24.774 --> 16:27.067
You know what,
I'm better off
without Shelby.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.488
Yes, you are.
 No, I'm not!

16:28.488 --> 16:30.320
Shelby's the best!
I love her!

16:30.320 --> 16:32.112
Yes, Shelby's
the best.

16:32.112 --> 16:35.075
But she drives me crazy!

16:35.075 --> 16:36.616
You're no help at all!

16:36.616 --> 16:38.458
Can't you see
how upset I am?

16:38.458 --> 16:41.461
Actually, no, I'm not
great at interpreting
facial expressions.

16:41.461 --> 16:44.214
Fortunately, I have
these emotion cards

16:44.214 --> 16:47.337
to help me determine
that you are bilious.

16:47.337 --> 16:48.718
Sanguine?

16:48.718 --> 16:50.220
Phlegmatic?

16:50.220 --> 16:52.432
Perhaps I should
update these.
They're from 1870.

16:53.633 --> 16:54.934
Hey, Cyd.

16:54.934 --> 16:57.227
Oh, my gosh,
why the sad face?

16:57.227 --> 16:59.189
Wait, you got
sad from that?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.191
Yeah, look.

17:01.191 --> 17:03.313
She's got the pouty lip
and the squiggly brow.

17:03.313 --> 17:05.315
Oh, I think I see it.

17:05.315 --> 17:08.147
Now she's mad.
Step back! Step back!

17:08.147 --> 17:11.781
Guys, I'm just upset
my best friend and I
aren't friends anymore.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.823
Please, it's been
two years.

17:13.823 --> 17:15.704
Perhaps this will help,

17:15.704 --> 17:16.826
move on.

17:18.157 --> 17:20.369
No, Barry,

17:20.369 --> 17:23.373
if you care about somebody,
you don't just
give up on them.

17:23.373 --> 17:26.336
I can't tell
if you're kidding
or phlegmatic.

17:27.837 --> 17:30.049
Sometimes two things
just belong together.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.262
Like when you
mix this drippy blue
with this jiggly yellow.

17:32.262 --> 17:34.554
I would not mix those.
 Of course you wouldn't.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.476
You're too much in here.

17:36.476 --> 17:38.178
In here,

17:38.178 --> 17:40.810
they come together
to make something beautiful.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.562
We have exactly
20 seconds

17:42.562 --> 17:44.394
to get this
into the blast box.

17:44.394 --> 17:46.065
I love the blast box.

17:50.950 --> 17:53.153
Hey.
 (EXPLOSION)

17:53.153 --> 17:54.654
NALDO: That was awesome!

17:57.867 --> 18:01.201
Cyd, I'm really sorry
I called you a slob.

18:01.201 --> 18:03.253
And I'm sorry
I called you a scrunch.

18:03.253 --> 18:05.205
Which isn't even a word,

18:05.205 --> 18:07.207
and sometimes
I make up words in anger.

18:09.969 --> 18:11.511
So we're friends again?

18:11.511 --> 18:15.265
Shelby, the whole reason
I didn't go to Peru
with my parents

18:15.265 --> 18:18.478
was because I was
afraid we wouldn't be
friends anymore,

18:19.559 --> 18:21.891
but in this future,

18:21.891 --> 18:24.394
we're not friends anyway.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.066
The minute I moved in
with you, it just...

18:27.857 --> 18:28.898
...didn't work.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.992
Maybe we're too different.

18:32.992 --> 18:35.695
Maybe we're not
meant to be friends.

18:37.657 --> 18:41.541
I was saving this
for your wedding day,

18:41.541 --> 18:44.294
but now just feels right.

18:44.294 --> 18:46.456
"Today, we are here
to celebrate the marriage

18:46.456 --> 18:49.008
"of my best friend
Cyd and Channing Tatum.

18:51.251 --> 18:55.134
"Channing Tatum,
sometimes you'll be bothered
by Cyd's slobbiness.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.847
"But you're no
peach either, C.T.

18:59.349 --> 19:01.851
"You can be
pretty controlling,

19:02.642 --> 19:05.475
"and maybe
even a scrunch.

19:05.475 --> 19:07.567
"So maybe you and Cyd
are kinda different.

19:08.478 --> 19:10.320
"But here's the thing,

19:10.320 --> 19:14.113
"you don't love each other
because of what
you have in common.

19:14.113 --> 19:16.866
"What you have in common
is that you love each other."

19:18.488 --> 19:19.869
That was a really
good speech.

19:19.869 --> 19:21.331
You got that I was
Channing Tatum, right?

19:21.331 --> 19:23.453
Yeah, I put that together,
Channing and I
will never fight.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.285
I know, you guys
are perfect for each other.

19:25.285 --> 19:26.996
(CHUCKLES)

19:26.996 --> 19:29.339
But so are we.

19:29.339 --> 19:31.341
Cyd, I don't
want to lose you.

19:31.341 --> 19:33.503
And I don't
want to lose you.

19:33.503 --> 19:36.296
You're the only
best friend I've ever had.

19:36.296 --> 19:39.969
But I can't
live in your room.

19:39.969 --> 19:41.561
It's not my room.

19:42.302 --> 19:44.304
It's our room.

19:44.304 --> 19:46.145
Do you really
mean that?

19:46.145 --> 19:48.608
Cyd, you're the
only best friend
I ever want to have.

19:54.364 --> 19:55.815
We're back.
 Don't...

19:57.447 --> 19:59.369
...drop me.

19:59.369 --> 20:01.241
Sorry!
 (ALARM BEEPING)

20:02.322 --> 20:03.533
(GROWLS)

20:05.375 --> 20:07.327
MOM: Girls, time to get
your Monday on!

20:07.327 --> 20:09.208
I was just thinking
about how I wish

20:09.208 --> 20:10.330
we could start
today over.

20:10.330 --> 20:11.631
And we hugged!

20:11.631 --> 20:13.423
Maybe that's it!
We think about a time

20:13.423 --> 20:15.635
while we're hugging
or touching or something.

20:15.635 --> 20:16.836
That must be
how it works.

20:16.836 --> 20:18.508
Did we just
figure out
time travel?

20:18.508 --> 20:20.099
I think we did.

20:21.601 --> 20:23.263
Well, come on,
we gotta get to school

20:23.263 --> 20:25.224
so you can ask
Cameron to the dance.

20:25.224 --> 20:29.228
You know, suddenly
Cameron doesn't seem
all that important.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.562
Let's stay here
and put up some of your
stuff in our room.

20:32.562 --> 20:34.404
Together.
 Wow, that was cheesy.

20:34.404 --> 20:36.025
You love it
when I'm cheesy.

20:36.025 --> 20:37.567
You're just so
good at it.
 I am good at it.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.158
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

20:39.158 --> 20:41.070
Oh, no.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.492
I just realized
that the projector,
the confetti cannon,

20:42.492 --> 20:43.623
and the
fist-pumping-jaw-dropper

20:43.623 --> 20:44.914
are still set up
at school!

20:46.866 --> 20:49.539
The dance, huh?
Solid ask!

20:49.539 --> 20:50.630
I'm in.

20:53.042 --> 20:55.295
I don't know who you are
or how this happened,

20:55.295 --> 20:56.716
but I'm gonna go with it.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.725
Putting this stuff up
is gonna be a ton of work.

21:05.725 --> 21:09.188
Ooh, let's jump
forward in time
to when it's all done!

21:09.188 --> 21:10.770
How great is time travel?

21:13.443 --> 21:17.487
You know, you can put
clothes in your dresser.

21:17.487 --> 21:19.569
Then where would
Diesel live?

21:19.569 --> 21:21.401
(BARKS AND BURPS)

21:26.826 --> 21:30.119
I'm sure I'll get
used to this
someday in the future.

21:35.124 --> 21:37.006
(BOTH SCREAMING)

21:41.921 --> 21:43.182
Was that the future?

21:43.182 --> 21:44.424
We're gonna need to
figure out what that was

21:44.424 --> 21:46.185
and what it means
and how to avoid it.

21:46.185 --> 21:47.847
We have to talk
to Barry about this.

21:47.847 --> 21:50.269
Cyd, to celebrate
your beauty...

21:50.269 --> 21:52.772
We prepared a little
dance for you.

21:52.772 --> 21:54.524
We're definitely
skipping over this.

21:58.738 --> 22:01.030
(BOTH PANTING)

22:01.030 --> 22:03.703
He's Big Brett!
 He's Big Chet!

22:03.703 --> 22:05.204
BOTH: Goodnight!

22:08.538 --> 22:10.289
We made a mistake.

22:10.289 --> 22:11.411
We need to go back
and see what
the heck that was.
