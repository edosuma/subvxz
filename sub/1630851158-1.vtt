{\an1}Harley, how you want
your wiener?

01:32.591 --> 01:35.294
{\an1}-Vigorously blown.
-What?

01:35.327 --> 01:36.696
I said burn it,

01:36.729 --> 01:39.499
{\an1}like you do every
other goddamned thing.

01:39.532 --> 01:41.567
{\an1}You know, I ain't gotta take
your shit, God damn it.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.603
{\an1}You know I could of married
Jerry Sprinklebum.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.304
{\an1}-He's a doctor, you know.
-Shit.

01:45.337 --> 01:48.474
{\an1}Jerry Sprinklebum
ain't no goddamned doctor.

01:48.507 --> 01:50.910
{\an1}Jerry Sprinklebum's
a goddamned music teacher

01:50.943 --> 01:52.545
who calls himself doctor

01:52.578 --> 01:55.181
{\an1}which probably means
he's a goddamned fruity pants.

01:55.214 --> 01:57.717
{\an1}Jerry Sprinklebum ain't
no goddamned fruity pants.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.785
{\an1}He's married
to Scarlett Jean Hammond.

01:59.818 --> 02:00.652
Let me ask you something.

02:00.686 --> 02:02.421
{\an1}Scarlett Jean Hammond
got any kids?

02:02.454 --> 02:03.589
No!

02:03.622 --> 02:06.192
Scarlett Jean ever tell you
how Jerry's got all them

02:06.225 --> 02:07.527
{\an1}body building magazines
laying around?

02:07.560 --> 02:09.428
He ain't never seen
the inside of a gym

02:09.461 --> 02:12.465
unless it's spelled J-I-M.

02:12.498 --> 02:14.567
{\an1}You know you're a goddamned
dipshit right?

02:14.600 --> 02:16.702
Eh.

02:16.735 --> 02:19.872
(clattering)

02:19.905 --> 02:22.241
{\an1}-Hey, Pa, what's this?
-Hey, where'd you get that?

02:22.274 --> 02:24.443
It was in a box between your
oddly shaped titty magazines

02:24.476 --> 02:26.746
and your hot soapy ass
fucking periodicals.

02:26.779 --> 02:29.315
Well now, hands off it,
don't bend the pages.

02:29.348 --> 02:30.750
Shit.

02:30.783 --> 02:34.253
{\an1}This here's what you might call
a collector's item.

02:34.286 --> 02:36.956
Looky here, issue number 1.

02:36.989 --> 02:39.759
{\an1}The Manson brothers
midnight zombie massacre.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.695
-Who's the Manson brothers?
-Who's the Manson brothers?

02:42.728 --> 02:44.830
They was the baddest ass
motherfucking tag team

02:44.863 --> 02:46.566
in professional wrestling.

02:46.599 --> 02:48.301
That's who they were.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.636
{\an1}You see they'd just begun
to smash their way

02:50.669 --> 02:52.505
{\an1}on to the wrestling scene,
right?

02:52.538 --> 02:53.906
And they had just had

02:53.939 --> 02:58.578
their very first
big match and...

02:58.611 --> 03:03.683
{\an9}♪

03:03.716 --> 03:05.251
Good lord, folks!

03:05.284 --> 03:07.320
{\an1}This is quite frankly
a massacre.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.821
A massacre.

03:08.854 --> 03:11.290
{\an1}In my 20 years
in professional wrestling,

03:11.323 --> 03:13.593
{\an1}I've never witnessed
such brutality.

03:13.626 --> 03:16.629
{\an1}The tag team champions
have just been torn to pieces

03:16.662 --> 03:19.365
{\an1}by the merciless onslaught
of the Manson brothers

03:19.398 --> 03:20.866
out of Chicago, Illinois.

03:20.899 --> 03:22.468
As you can see behind me,

03:22.501 --> 03:25.238
paramedics are tending to
the former tag team champs.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.273
Your tag team champions
are nothing but a couple

03:27.306 --> 03:30.409
{\an1}of low down floor-fudging
sacks of lizard shit!

03:30.442 --> 03:32.912
{\an1}Now listen up, little man,
and listen good!

03:32.945 --> 03:35.281
{\an1}There's nobody, nobody
that's getting in the ring

03:35.314 --> 03:37.516
with the Manson brothers
and going bell to bell!

03:37.549 --> 03:38.784
We don't beat people up!

03:38.817 --> 03:40.820
{\an1}-We beat them off!
-Down, we beat them down.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.488
-Whatever.
-My God!

03:42.521 --> 03:44.357
Stone Manson, a word.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.459
What do you have to say
for yourself, young man?

03:46.492 --> 03:48.461
{\an1}Here's what I got to say
for myself, Bob!

03:48.494 --> 03:50.930
{\an1}Outside of the stench
and all the ugly broads,

03:50.963 --> 03:54.634
{\an1}it's okay to be
in Santa Fe, New Mexico!

03:54.667 --> 03:56.469
{\an1}Hey, Bob,
I got a question for you.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.404
{\an1}-Do you go to church on Sundays?
-Well, of course--

03:58.437 --> 04:00.573
I don't care if you go
to church on Sundays!

04:00.606 --> 04:02.908
{\an1}Because the unholy
reign of terror

04:02.941 --> 04:05.811
{\an1}that we are about to unleash
on New Mexico

04:05.844 --> 04:09.315
{\an1}is going to be biblical
in proportions!

04:09.348 --> 04:12.385
{\an1}Nothing and I mean nothing
but an act of God

04:12.418 --> 04:14.420
can stop the Manson brothers!

04:14.453 --> 04:15.955
Ladies and gentleman!

04:15.988 --> 04:19.425
Welcome to the apocalypse!

04:19.458 --> 04:21.827
(cheering)

04:21.860 --> 04:24.330
{\an9}♪

04:24.363 --> 04:26.732
{\an1}I thought you said this fucking
thing has zombies in it.

04:26.765 --> 04:28.534
Have some patience, God damn it!

04:28.567 --> 04:31.437
{\an1}This is what you call
an origin, right?

04:31.470 --> 04:33.472
{\an1}-And set up.
-Harley, stop feeding him full

04:33.505 --> 04:35.875
{\an1}of that horse shit and teach him
about some real art.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.610
Shirlene, the only art
you know is that kid

04:37.643 --> 04:39.345
{\an1}with a big old wart
on his pecker

04:39.378 --> 04:41.814
you gave a hand job to
in that unisex shit house

04:41.847 --> 04:43.349
in the third grade.

04:43.382 --> 04:44.383
That wasn't a wart.

04:44.416 --> 04:46.552
That was an extra dick.

04:46.585 --> 04:50.323
I felt sorry for that boy,
it was damn near charity.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.425
Listen to me, boy.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.626
This may save your life one day.

04:53.659 --> 04:56.762
Don't you ever, ever,

04:56.795 --> 04:58.731
{\an1}ever marry no woman
who's stupid enough to believe

04:58.764 --> 05:02.101
{\an1}that a big old pulsating wart
is an extra dick.

05:02.134 --> 05:04.003
You promise me now, boy.

05:04.036 --> 05:05.705
Yes, sir, I promise.

05:05.738 --> 05:07.540
Make me proud, son.

05:07.573 --> 05:10.710
But Pa, what happened
to the Manson brothers?

05:10.743 --> 05:13.412
{\an1}Well now,
they began a 20 year rise

05:13.445 --> 05:15.114
{\an1}to the top
of the wrestling scene,

05:15.147 --> 05:19.919
{\an1}capturing the WWO tag team title
record five times.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.520
And this happens
with these guys.

05:21.553 --> 05:23.756
{\an1}Well, they got into
some trouble...

05:23.789 --> 05:25.624
of the po-po kind.

05:25.657 --> 05:27.927
{\an1}Got themselves excommunicated
from the big leagues

05:27.960 --> 05:30.396
and go back on the road
and cut a hard living

05:30.429 --> 05:31.831
on the indie circuit.

05:31.864 --> 05:34.133
{\an1}And that brought them
right back here

05:34.166 --> 05:37.737
{\an1}to present day
in the beginning of our story.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.406
Santa Fe, New Mexico,

05:40.439 --> 05:44.143
some many, many years later.

05:44.176 --> 05:45.644
Hey, hey, hey!

05:45.677 --> 05:47.813
{\an1}We're gonna make
so much money tonight.

05:47.846 --> 05:49.915
{\an1}There he is the world's
number one promoter

05:49.948 --> 05:51.417
of bullshit.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.485
The t-shirts alone!

05:52.518 --> 05:53.853
It's a license to print money.

05:53.886 --> 05:54.887
We are gonna kill it.

05:54.921 --> 05:57.390
{\an1}-Well, I am anyway.
-How do you want it to go?

05:57.423 --> 05:58.424
How do I want it to go?

05:58.457 --> 05:59.859
How do you want it to go?

05:59.892 --> 06:01.927
I'm marketing, you're content.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.865
{\an1}You know what, I want action,
revenge, lust.

06:05.898 --> 06:07.400
Big, it's a big night.

06:07.433 --> 06:08.501
Okay, give me big.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.002
{\an1}Twenty good minutes,
take it home.

06:10.035 --> 06:11.070
You're looking good, Ricky.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.506
I smell money!

06:13.539 --> 06:15.808
{\an1}Boy, some shit never changes,
don't it?

06:15.841 --> 06:18.711
{\an1}Yeah, they're letting this place
go to the shit hole.

06:18.744 --> 06:21.080
-What a toilet.
-Yeah, money!

06:21.113 --> 06:24.150
{\an1}You guys haven't been around
in a while.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.018
Vic's doing the best he can,

06:26.051 --> 06:30.089
but the business just isn't
what it was 25-30 years ago.

06:30.122 --> 06:32.491
Hey, who's going over?

06:32.524 --> 06:34.593
We ain't got that far yet.

06:34.626 --> 06:36.996
How about I go over on Skull
with the scorpion death lock?

06:37.029 --> 06:38.964
Err, not happening, kid.

06:38.997 --> 06:40.165
I ain't a kid, gramps,

06:40.198 --> 06:43.903
{\an1}so you can take your AARP card
and shove it up your ass.

06:43.936 --> 06:45.571
{\an1}Hey, Jackie,
how about a fuck finish?

06:45.604 --> 06:46.972
Yeah, fuck finish
is good with us.

06:47.005 --> 06:50.009
{\an1}-Hang on--
-Rick, it's a fuck finish.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.911
Okay?

06:51.944 --> 06:54.680
{\an1}-How do you want to do it?
-We'll build the heat on Rick.

06:54.713 --> 06:56.916
{\an1}-Set you up with a false tag--
-Wait, wait, wait.

06:56.949 --> 06:57.950
Why do I have to take the heat?

06:57.984 --> 07:01.954
{\an1}-Hey, Rains, who trained you?
-Carson Murdock.

07:01.987 --> 07:05.558
{\an1}-Aces.
-Carson the Crippler Murdock?

07:05.591 --> 07:06.992
The living legend himself?

07:07.025 --> 07:08.594
Yeah, just ask him.

07:08.627 --> 07:09.595
{\an1}You know he tells everybody
he's the last

07:09.628 --> 07:11.964
{\an1}-of the old school hookers.
-'Cause he is.

07:11.997 --> 07:14.867
{\an1}No, Thump's a hooker,
Skull's a hooker.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.902
Carson, not a hooker.

07:16.935 --> 07:19.004
{\an1}Hey, he beat your brother,
the so-called hooker,

07:19.037 --> 07:20.906
in that legit shoot in '92 so--

07:20.939 --> 07:22.775
{\an1}That's a bunch of crap
and you know it.

07:22.808 --> 07:26.011
It happened, can't change
the record books, Stone.

07:26.044 --> 07:28.514
{\an1}Well, much like
the living legend himself,

07:28.547 --> 07:30.816
that's the biggest myth in
professional wrestling, son.

07:30.849 --> 07:32.485
{\an1}Carson the Crippler Murdock,
the only guy

07:32.518 --> 07:34.587
{\an1}to ever beat Skull Manson
in a legit shoot.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.522
{\an1}Carson thinks if he tells
himself enough times,

07:36.555 --> 07:38.757
{\an1}it will actually become real,
just like Pinocchio.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.560
-Pinocchio is real?
-No, it's a fairytale

07:41.593 --> 07:43.729
{\an1}like Jack and the Beanstalk,
leprechauns,

07:43.762 --> 07:46.065
and Carson's career.

07:46.098 --> 07:47.833
{\an1}You wouldn't be laughing
if Carson was here.

07:47.866 --> 07:49.702
{\an1}You're right, I'd be laughing
twice as hard.

07:49.735 --> 07:52.571
{\an1}Carson could tap out you and
you're rocket scientist brother.

07:52.604 --> 07:53.973
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Bring it, Pops.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.040
What are you doing?

07:55.073 --> 07:56.174
{\an1}He called you
a rocket scientist.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.544
{\an1}Well, jokes on him, I don't know
nothing about rockets.

07:58.577 --> 08:01.947
-Jesus.
-Guys, come on.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.849
I'll take the heat, all right?

08:03.882 --> 08:06.519
{\an1}-I'll take it.
-See, kid, that's a pro.

08:06.552 --> 08:07.920
{\an1}Hey, Skull,
what's four plus four?

08:07.953 --> 08:09.288
{\an1}-I don't know, seven probably.
-Keep pushing it.

08:09.321 --> 08:13.158
Can we just work the match?

08:13.191 --> 08:14.727
Stone, lay it out for us.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.095
We'll build the heat on you.

08:16.128 --> 08:17.296
{\an1}When I tell you
we'll go corner to corner

08:17.329 --> 08:19.131
{\an1}for the big clothesline,
you reverse it.

08:19.164 --> 08:20.799
Skull will nail me with it.

08:20.832 --> 08:23.035
{\an1}You tag in Rick, he'll come in
and clean house.

08:23.068 --> 08:25.070
{\an1}We'll bail,
ref will call for the bell.

08:25.103 --> 08:27.606
{\an1}Double DQ, everybody goes home
strong, cool?

08:27.639 --> 08:29.275
{\an1}-Sounds like a plan.
-All right, let's do it.

08:29.308 --> 08:33.044
{\an1}-Why do we gotta get DQ'd, Jack?
-That's your boy.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.113
We're supposed to be the champs.

08:34.145 --> 08:36.249
This is bullshit!

08:37.716 --> 08:39.251
Hey, Rick.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.654
{\an1}You want to be
a professional wrestler, right?

08:41.687 --> 08:43.121
Then be professional.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.924
This is entertainment.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.992
You are an entertainer.

08:47.025 --> 08:51.097
So get ready to entertain.

08:53.932 --> 08:57.136
Oh my God.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.605
{\an1}I swear that kid has an all-day
hard-on for you guys.

08:59.638 --> 09:01.173
Yeah, what else is new?

09:01.206 --> 09:03.809
-Hey, Skull.
-Yeah?

09:03.842 --> 09:06.612
{\an1}Did Carson actually beat you
in '92?

09:06.645 --> 09:08.013
Fair and square.

09:08.046 --> 09:11.116
{\an1}Yeah, well,
he did but he didn't.

09:11.149 --> 09:12.651
How's that?

09:12.684 --> 09:14.653
{\an1}They wanted to give Carson
a push

09:14.686 --> 09:16.355
{\an1}so they set up a match
with Skull

09:16.388 --> 09:17.923
{\an1}who's trained by Thump
who everyone knows

09:17.956 --> 09:20.292
{\an1}is like the baddest motherfucker
on the planet, right?

09:20.325 --> 09:21.994
Nice guy that he is,

09:22.027 --> 09:24.263
{\an1}Skull makes Carson
look like a million bucks.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.298
-'Cause that's what we do.
-'Cause that's what we do.

09:26.331 --> 09:28.167
{\an1}Problem is Mr. Congeniality
over here

09:28.200 --> 09:30.102
{\an1}completely forgets
that there's a time limit

09:30.135 --> 09:31.670
and before he can
reverse Carson,

09:31.703 --> 09:33.939
{\an1}the bell rings,
there's no submission

09:33.972 --> 09:35.608
{\an1}and Carson's in
the superior position.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.643
{\an1}So guess what,
based on the rules,

09:37.676 --> 09:39.745
{\an1}shitty pants over here
loses on points.

09:39.778 --> 09:40.713
Shitty pants?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.147
{\an1}You shit your pants one time
with this guy,

09:42.180 --> 09:43.148
you never live it down.

09:43.181 --> 09:44.950
{\an1}Well, thank you for clearing
that up for me.

09:44.983 --> 09:47.119
{\an1}-Sure thing.
-See you out there.

09:54.826 --> 09:57.696
{\an1}Skull, why don't you take
that jabroni Rains

09:57.729 --> 09:59.398
{\an1}and stretch the living hell
out of him?

09:59.431 --> 10:00.432
Ain't it funny?

10:00.466 --> 10:03.035
{\an1}All the guys Carson trains
are just like he is.

10:03.068 --> 10:05.104
You mean arrogant shit hooks
who believe their own bullshit?

10:05.137 --> 10:07.940
{\an1}Yeah, well the business
is full of rotten jabronies

10:07.973 --> 10:08.841
like that now.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.676
{\an1}It ain't the business
I came up in.

10:10.709 --> 10:13.278
{\an1}You ever think
about retiring, Thump?

10:13.311 --> 10:15.247
I'm too old to retire, son.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.915
Wrestling's all I know.

10:16.948 --> 10:19.685
{\an1}I'll either be carried out
of that ring in a box

10:19.718 --> 10:22.321
or probably go tits up
in some shit bag motel.

10:22.354 --> 10:24.890
Just another forgotten bust out.

10:24.923 --> 10:26.959
Who's gonna forget Thump Hanson?

10:26.992 --> 10:28.861
{\an1}You're the last of
the old school hookers.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.362
{\an1}Not to mention you trained
the Manson Brothers.

10:30.395 --> 10:32.097
You're an icon, Thump.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.699
You got the most
prophylactic career

10:33.732 --> 10:34.967
in professional wrestling.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.201
{\an1}We always telling you,
you gotta have

10:36.234 --> 10:38.003
a more prostitute attitude.

10:38.036 --> 10:39.338
{\an1}Don't be so negative
all the time.

10:39.371 --> 10:41.440
Well, that's why
I love you boys.

10:41.473 --> 10:43.776
{\an1}Now if you'll excuse me,
I'mma go home

10:43.809 --> 10:45.177

{\an1}He says when I get

11:22.981 --> 11:26.018

11:50.275 --> 11:52.244
I had three beers at the RV

11:52.277 --> 11:54.513

11:54.546 --> 11:56.081
{\an1}Skull, honey,
you forgot your aspirin

11:56.114 --> 11:57.750

11:57.783 --> 11:58.917
Too good to me, Luce.

long I will drop to my knees--

12:23.508 --> 12:25.010
{\an1}-And?
-Nothing, I'll just drop

12:25.043 --> 12:26.211

18:37.215 --> 18:41.319
{\an1}Listen, I can promote the fuck
out of a re-match.

18:41.352 --> 18:42.621
Oh!

18:42.654 --> 18:44.656
Do you freaking hear that?

18:44.689 --> 18:47.492
Re-match, baby!

18:47.525 --> 18:49.261
Jack, sorry about your partner.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.829
No, fuck that jabroni man.

18:50.862 --> 18:53.498
{\an1}-Listen to that crowd.
-Re-match, baby.

18:53.531 --> 18:54.432
How we gonna have a re-match

18:54.466 --> 18:55.934
when his partner's
all regurgitating?

18:55.967 --> 18:57.235
No, I got that all figured out.

18:57.268 --> 18:58.503
We do a big mystery partner.

18:58.536 --> 19:00.272
{\an1}-It's gold.
-Marks love that gimmick.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.440
{\an1}Aren't we putting the horse
before the ox?

19:02.473 --> 19:03.307
The cart.

19:03.341 --> 19:04.743
The ox, the horse,
whatever the fuck.

19:04.776 --> 19:08.180
Wait, wait, wait,
listen to this.

19:08.213 --> 19:12.584
{\an1}Next Saturday,
Halloween night at midnight,

19:12.617 --> 19:16.288
{\an1}right here in Santa Fe,
New Mexico

19:16.321 --> 19:20.392
there will be a re-match!

19:20.425 --> 19:21.726
And not just a re-match.

19:21.759 --> 19:23.562
A steel cage re-match,

19:23.595 --> 19:25.964
15-foot tall steel cage.

19:25.997 --> 19:27.399
Did you say cage match?

19:27.432 --> 19:29.501
A Jack cage match, huh, huh?

19:29.534 --> 19:31.870
{\an1}-Love me, love me?
-Love you!

19:31.903 --> 19:33.205
I love you so much.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.806
(laughing)

19:34.839 --> 19:37.309
This Halloween at midnight,

19:37.342 --> 19:41.813
the merciless Manson Brothers
against Jack the Rage Cage

19:41.846 --> 19:43.515
and a mystery partner.

19:43.548 --> 19:44.716
Cage match at midnight?

19:44.749 --> 19:46.785
Come on, you can stay up one
time past midnight, Cinderella.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.353
{\an1}You're not gonna turn
into a pumpkin.

19:48.386 --> 19:49.721
{\an1}Come on, Skull,
I really need this one.

19:49.754 --> 19:51.223
{\an1}-I'll double your payout.
-Done.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.724
{\an1}-Hang on.
-Come on, what do you say?

19:52.757 --> 19:54.559
{\an1}-Come on, Skull.
-It'll be just like old days.

19:54.592 --> 19:56.294
Yeah, Jackie, it'll be aces.

19:56.327 --> 19:58.230
-Yeah!
-Paycheck!

19:58.263 --> 20:00.699
-Jack, come here.
-Come here, you.

20:00.732 --> 20:01.900
{\an1}Don't you think
we need to be, you know,

20:01.933 --> 20:04.336
{\an1}-copathetic like on decisions?
-Copacetic.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.671
Copathetic, copacetic,
copa who gives a shit.

20:06.704 --> 20:07.839
I don't want to do it.

20:07.872 --> 20:09.140
{\an1}I'm in bed every night
at 10 o'clock.

20:09.174 --> 20:12.444
I give Lucy a backrub and we
watch our soaps and that's it.

20:12.477 --> 20:13.545
I got an idea.

20:13.578 --> 20:15.247
{\an1}Why don't you just do
a singles match with Jack?

20:15.280 --> 20:16.448
-How about that?
-No, no, no.

20:16.481 --> 20:17.949
{\an1}I'm no good wrestling
without you ever.

20:17.982 --> 20:19.551
{\an1}Ah, that's a load of crap
and you know it.

20:19.584 --> 20:20.852
{\an1}Now you're just being
stupidicious.

20:20.885 --> 20:22.554
{\an1}No I'm not,
we work as a team, period.

20:22.587 --> 20:24.456
Listen, you, if you think Vic,

20:24.489 --> 20:25.690
{\an1}God bless
his little black heart,

20:25.723 --> 20:27.726
{\an1}is gonna pony up
$1,500 a piece for us

20:27.759 --> 20:29.694
{\an1}you're crazier
than a shit house rat.

20:29.727 --> 20:33.632
He hasn't always been
financially a cannibal.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.367
{\an1}You're giving me
a brain tumor, Carlos.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.003
{\an1}It's financially accountable,
doofus.

20:38.036 --> 20:39.771
A cannibal?

20:39.804 --> 20:42.507
{\an1}Evil Dutch Decker is on the card
and he gets a big payout.

20:42.540 --> 20:43.808
No way Evil Dutch
get's more than us.

20:43.841 --> 20:45.410
I bet you he gets a grand tops.

20:45.443 --> 20:46.578
(scoffing)

20:48.746 --> 20:50.415
Brutal.

20:53.718 --> 20:54.719
The Manson Brothers.

20:54.752 --> 20:55.920
-What's up guys?
-Oh, Dutch.

20:55.953 --> 20:57.489
-Hey, hey.
-Can I bum one?

20:57.522 --> 20:59.357
Of course.

20:59.390 --> 21:00.725
-Thanks, brother.
-You're welcome.

21:00.758 --> 21:02.694
{\an1}Dutch, is it me or have you
gotten a lot bigger

21:02.727 --> 21:04.763
{\an1}since we saw you
in Amarillo last month?

21:04.796 --> 21:06.831
{\an1}I'm trying to get back
to 250 again.

21:06.864 --> 21:09.501
{\an1}You know, Jack Cage got a hold
of this new GH for me

21:09.534 --> 21:10.869
off the Chinese black market.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.704
Dude, it's freaking amazing.

21:12.737 --> 21:15.940
{\an1}It's gonna turn me
into a freaking monster.

21:15.973 --> 21:17.542
{\an1}He's supposed to be meeting
his guy tonight

21:17.575 --> 21:19.444
{\an1}-to get me more of it.
-You better be careful, man.

21:19.477 --> 21:21.746
The Chinese aren't exactly known
for their strict quality control

21:21.779 --> 21:23.481
and sterile work environments.

21:23.514 --> 21:24.449
{\an1}Who knows what
they put in that shit.

21:24.482 --> 21:25.817
It might kill you.

21:25.850 --> 21:28.353
Yeah, but at least I'll die big.

21:28.386 --> 21:29.988
(laughing)

21:30.021 --> 21:31.056
Want some?

21:31.089 --> 21:32.424
My body's a church.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.426
{\an1}-Temple.
-Whatever, Poindexter.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.028
{\an1}Hey, what was that shit show
with Rains?

21:37.061 --> 21:38.963
{\an1}Rains tried to get him
to say uncle.

21:38.996 --> 21:41.433
{\an1}-Skull broke his foot.
-Nice.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.568
{\an1}Yeah, it was kind of like that
but not exactly.

21:43.601 --> 21:44.803
He's parafilating as little bit.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.072
{\an1}Well, he did try
to get you to say uncle.

21:47.105 --> 21:48.606
{\an1}You know where that comes from,
say uncle?

21:48.639 --> 21:49.708
-No.
-You're serious?

21:49.741 --> 21:51.009
{\an1}-You never heard that?
-No.

21:51.042 --> 21:52.811
{\an1}No, all right,
check this out, right?

21:52.844 --> 21:54.713
So this old wrestler
had this parrot, right,

21:54.746 --> 21:57.782
{\an1}and he bets his buddy 100 bucks
that the parrot can talk.

21:57.815 --> 22:01.920
So he tells the parrot,
"Hey, Tippy, say uncle,"

22:01.953 --> 22:03.455
{\an1}but the parrot
just stares at him.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.824
{\an1}So again he looks at the parrot
and this time he goes,

22:05.857 --> 22:09.794
"Hey Tippy, say uncle,"

22:09.827 --> 22:11.029
but the parrot just sits there.

22:11.062 --> 22:13.765
Silent like a statue.

22:13.798 --> 22:15.667
{\an1}Now the old guy's
getting pissed, right,

22:15.700 --> 22:17.736
{\an1}so he grabs the parrot
around his tiny little neck

22:17.769 --> 22:19.938
{\an1}in a choke hold
and he starts screaming,

22:19.971 --> 22:21.606
"Say uncle!

22:21.639 --> 22:23.108
Say uncle!"

22:23.141 --> 22:24.876
He's getting freaking crazy.

22:24.909 --> 22:26.478
-Insane.
-And?

22:26.511 --> 22:28.546
{\an1}-And what?
-Did the bird say it?

22:28.579 --> 22:30.582
No, he freaking killed it,

22:30.615 --> 22:33.518
but that's where it comes from.

22:33.551 --> 22:34.652
Dutch, I got a question for you.

22:34.685 --> 22:35.754
What's your payout next week?

22:35.787 --> 22:36.922
Oh, come on guys.

22:36.955 --> 22:38.823
You know we're not supposed
to talk about that crap.

22:38.856 --> 22:40.825
{\an1}Dutch, we ain't
gonna tell nobody.

22:40.858 --> 22:42.560
All right, all right.

22:42.593 --> 22:45.630
My guarantee is 999 bucks, okay?

22:45.663 --> 22:47.499
{\an1}Am I fucking Nostradamus
or what?

22:47.532 --> 22:49.067
{\an1}That's that deformed half-back
from Notre Dame.

22:49.100 --> 22:50.368
I love that guy.

22:50.402 --> 22:52.971
That's Quasimodo, professor,
and he never played football.

22:53.004 --> 22:55.073
Skull, Stone's right though.

22:55.106 --> 22:58.777
The guys you're talking about,
he played for Michigan State.

22:58.810 --> 22:59.677
All right, Mansons.

22:59.710 --> 23:00.745
See you on Halloween.

23:00.778 --> 23:02.080
-Bye, Dutch.
-Bye, Dutch.

23:02.113 --> 23:04.482
(distant sirens wailing)

23:04.515 --> 23:06.184
{\an1}-Fucker is nuts.
-Speaking of Halloween,

23:06.217 --> 23:07.619
{\an1}you gonna do
the midnight cage match

23:07.652 --> 23:08.787
or you gonna be a wet sandwich?

23:08.820 --> 23:10.588
I'm not a wet sandwich.

23:10.621 --> 23:11.756
{\an1}Table three,
your order's ready.

23:11.789 --> 23:13.191
One wet sandwich.

23:13.224 --> 23:14.626
Hold the fun.

23:14.659 --> 23:15.493
Listen, little brother.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.028
You know damn well
them cage matches

23:17.061 --> 23:18.096
can get out of hand real fast.

23:18.129 --> 23:20.565
{\an1}Nobody needs to pop out an eye
or tear a liniment

23:20.598 --> 23:21.499
or nothing like that.

23:21.533 --> 23:24.068
{\an1}Like Mom used to say,
Carlos, relajate.

23:24.101 --> 23:25.804
{\an1}Yeah, why was she always talking
like that anyway?

23:25.837 --> 23:27.505
Uh, because she's Mexican.

23:27.538 --> 23:28.907
Mom's Mexican?

23:28.940 --> 23:30.442
But that would make us Mexican.

23:30.475 --> 23:32.110
Yes, brother dear,
we are half Mexican.

23:32.143 --> 23:33.044
{\an1}Are you fucking with me
right now?

23:33.078 --> 23:34.779
{\an1}You could knock me over
with a rubber dick.

23:34.812 --> 23:36.047
I had no idea.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.983
So the fact that Mom's name
was Maria Angelina Hernandez,

23:39.016 --> 23:40.485
that didn't register with you?

23:40.518 --> 23:42.187
{\an1}Or that we called
our grandfather abuelo?

23:42.220 --> 23:43.388
No, not even a little.

23:43.421 --> 23:45.757
How about the fact that Mom
spoke with a Spanish accent?

23:45.790 --> 23:47.158
I thought she had
a speech epidemic.

23:47.191 --> 23:48.526
Your name is Carlos.

23:48.559 --> 23:50.028
{\an1}I thought she named me
after abuelo.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.564
I'm done.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.699
Pinche cabron.

23:54.732 --> 23:57.569
{\an1}So did Skull agree to the
midnight Halloween cage match?

23:57.602 --> 24:02.474
{\an1}He surely did and that's when
the shit got weird.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.976
Read on, boy.

24:05.009 --> 24:07.946
{\an1}-Hey, what's up, brother?
-Hey, how long does it take?

24:07.979 --> 24:08.947
That HGH is not doing anything.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.182
Get out of the fucking hall.

24:11.215 --> 24:12.717
Are you kidding me?

24:12.750 --> 24:13.885
How long have you been on?

24:13.918 --> 24:15.119
-A week.
-A week?

24:15.152 --> 24:17.121
{\an1}-Yeah.
-Dude, you gotta be patient.

24:17.154 --> 24:18.857
{\an1}You're gonna be a beast, bro,
I guarantee it.

24:18.890 --> 24:20.892
You're gonna be like you could
take a chunk out of somebody.

24:20.925 --> 24:22.760
{\an1}-Just wait.
-That would be nice.

24:22.793 --> 24:23.795
Yeah.

24:23.828 --> 24:25.163
I think I need some more though.

24:25.196 --> 24:26.531
I want to stay on it longer.

24:26.564 --> 24:27.966
Oh, come on.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.734
All right, take one.

24:29.767 --> 24:31.803
You can owe me.

24:31.836 --> 24:33.037
{\an1}-All right.
-Can I get one more?

24:33.070 --> 24:34.606
No, you're good.

24:34.639 --> 24:35.974
That'll last you the week.

24:36.007 --> 24:37.609
All right, thanks, Big Wang.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.110
Hasta luego.

24:39.143 --> 24:40.111
(door creaking)

24:40.144 --> 24:44.649
{\an9}♪

24:44.682 --> 24:45.917
Ohh.

24:45.950 --> 24:48.753
{\an1}I'm going to be
a killing machine.

24:48.786 --> 24:50.054
Yeah.

24:50.087 --> 25:00.031
{\an9}♪

25:00.998 --> 25:03.568
(groaning)

25:03.601 --> 25:12.844
{\an9}♪

25:12.877 --> 25:15.213
(groaning)

25:19.717 --> 25:20.818
Psst.

25:20.851 --> 25:22.687
Oh, hey.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.988
Get my back for me,
will you, buddy?

25:24.021 --> 25:26.157
Hey, bro.

25:26.190 --> 25:28.192
Hide that.

25:28.225 --> 25:29.961
{\an1}It's too open,
there's too many people here.

25:29.994 --> 25:32.330
Come on.

25:32.363 --> 25:34.132
Too many people?

25:34.165 --> 25:39.971
{\an9}♪

25:40.004 --> 25:42.707
This freaking door has been
busted since Prohibition.

25:42.740 --> 25:45.677
They say a guy got stuck in here
over a holiday weekend one time.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.011
{\an1}Poor fucker
shit all over himself

25:47.044 --> 25:49.247
{\an1}and nearly starved
half to death.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.049
Starved to death, Jesus.

25:51.082 --> 25:53.117
{\an1}I don't think you have anything
to worry about, Big Wang.

25:53.150 --> 25:55.687
{\an1}It doesn't look like
you've ever missed a meal.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.189
Hold this.

25:58.222 --> 26:00.792
(groaning)

26:00.825 --> 26:05.597
{\an9}♪

26:05.630 --> 26:07.999
(thudding)

26:08.032 --> 26:12.036
{\an9}♪

26:12.069 --> 26:14.272
Come on.

26:14.305 --> 26:16.808
(door creaking)

26:18.109 --> 26:21.079
{\an1}Yeah, hey,
this GH is crazy, man.

26:21.112 --> 26:22.947
Listen, I'm eating all the time.

26:22.980 --> 26:25.717
{\an1}Well, who am I kidding,
I ate all the time before.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.885
Oh, oh, ah, God.

26:27.918 --> 26:29.988
{\an1}-You all right, buddy?
-Damn it.

26:30.021 --> 26:33.825
{\an1}Yeah, hey, hey,
I put on 15 pounds

26:33.858 --> 26:35.393
{\an1}-in a week on this shit.
-Serious?

26:35.426 --> 26:37.729
I can't wait to try it, man.

26:37.762 --> 26:38.997
Wait, you didn't start?

26:39.030 --> 26:40.665
{\an1}No, I sold my shit
to Evil Dutch.

26:40.698 --> 26:44.669
{\an1}-That's why I need some more.
-Have no fear.

26:44.702 --> 26:46.404
Big Wang is here.

26:46.437 --> 26:49.841
Oh, well, I do like clowns.

26:49.874 --> 26:52.343
I gave another kick
to The Great Chorizo.

26:52.376 --> 26:54.946
{\an1}Yeah, that kid's got
big aspirations.

26:54.979 --> 26:56.748
(laughing)

26:56.781 --> 26:58.116
Ooh, ooh.

26:58.149 --> 26:59.417
Ah!

26:59.450 --> 27:01.352
(coughing)

27:01.385 --> 27:03.087
Whoa.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.689
You all right, Big Wang?

27:04.722 --> 27:06.190
{\an1}Hey, you don't look so good,
buddy.

27:06.223 --> 27:08.660
You okay?

27:08.693 --> 27:10.194
What the fuck, Wang?

27:10.227 --> 27:12.797
(retching)

27:12.830 --> 27:21.906
{\an9}♪

27:21.939 --> 27:24.308
(snarling)

27:24.341 --> 27:29.113
{\an9}♪

27:29.146 --> 27:31.716

27:31.749 --> 27:37.355

27:37.388 --> 27:39.957

27:39.990 --> 27:44.395

27:44.428 --> 27:46.764
(grunting)

27:46.797 --> 27:49.967
(snarling)

27:50.000 --> 27:53.337
(snapping)

27:53.370 --> 27:56.140
(gasping)

27:56.173 --> 27:58.743
(groaning)

27:58.776 --> 28:08.720
{\an9}♪

28:08.753 --> 28:10.955
I fucking knew it.

28:10.988 --> 28:14.159
{\an9}♪

28:15.893 --> 28:18.429
(whistling)

28:18.462 --> 28:28.406
{\an9}♪

28:32.877 --> 28:36.481
{\an1}This Halloween night,
for the first time anywhere,

28:36.514 --> 28:40.918
The Great Chorizo!

28:40.951 --> 28:41.819
You're kidding, right?

28:41.852 --> 28:43.921
{\an1}No, no, this is your chance
to shine.

28:43.954 --> 28:45.823
Go big or go home, baby.

28:45.856 --> 28:47.825
-But--
-I smell money.

28:47.858 --> 28:49.427
{\an1}-Yip, yip, yip, yip!
-Vic...

28:49.460 --> 28:52.463
{\an9}♪

28:52.496 --> 28:53.865
(sighing)

28:53.898 --> 28:57.135
(distant traffic whirring)

28:57.168 --> 28:59.504
(thunder rumbling)

29:02.907 --> 29:09.280
{\an9}♪

29:09.313 --> 29:11.048
(bell ringing)

29:11.081 --> 29:13.184
{\an9}♪

29:13.217 --> 29:16.954
(cat meowing)

29:16.987 --> 29:18.022
Hello.

29:18.055 --> 29:21.159
I've been waiting for you.

29:21.192 --> 29:24.262
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

29:24.295 --> 29:26.564
{\an1}Looks like you guys have some
really cool shit in here.

29:26.597 --> 29:29.367
Would you like to see
something very special?

29:29.400 --> 29:32.003
{\an1}-You will like it.
-Absolutely.

29:32.036 --> 29:35.540
{\an9}♪

29:35.573 --> 29:38.543
Para usted y su hermano.

29:38.576 --> 29:41.479
For me and my hermano,
my brother, the dick?

29:41.512 --> 29:42.947
Mucho dicko.

29:42.980 --> 29:44.549
Yes, dicko.

29:44.582 --> 29:46.150
Sure, let's see it.

29:46.183 --> 29:48.553
(cat meowing)

29:48.586 --> 29:51.289
{\an9}♪

29:51.322 --> 29:54.025
Los mascaras de luchadores.

29:54.058 --> 29:56.394
Luchador mask.

29:56.427 --> 29:58.996
Bueno suerta y magia.

29:59.029 --> 30:03.534
They are filled with luck
and with a spooky magic.

30:03.567 --> 30:06.003
Pero, if you take them,

30:06.036 --> 30:07.338
they are yours.

30:07.371 --> 30:08.339
Do you understand?

30:08.372 --> 30:10.141
No, but I'll take them anyway.

30:10.174 --> 30:11.542
{\an1}These are perfect
for the Halloween show.

30:11.575 --> 30:14.111
Um...

30:14.144 --> 30:15.513
{\an1}You know what,
I'm a little light on cash.

30:15.546 --> 30:16.614
{\an1}Can I go to the bank
and come back?

30:16.647 --> 30:17.882
No, no.

30:17.915 --> 30:19.317
Gratis.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.886
-For free.
-Sold.

30:21.919 --> 30:24.922
{\an1}You've made some incredible
strides in the last six months.

30:24.955 --> 30:27.191
{\an1}My only concern is you being
on the road so long

30:27.224 --> 30:29.060
and going off the program.

30:29.093 --> 30:30.394
Doc, I am doing great

30:30.427 --> 30:32.396
{\an1}and there's absolutely no reason
to be concerned.

30:32.429 --> 30:36.100
{\an1}Well, I know that there are
a lot of casinos where you are

30:36.133 --> 30:39.003
and I want to make sure that
the temptation isn't too great.

30:39.036 --> 30:41.539
Listen, Doc, my gambling
was destroying my life,

30:41.572 --> 30:43.407
{\an1}not to mention
bringing a ton of pain

30:43.440 --> 30:44.708
to my sweet little Mina.

30:44.742 --> 30:46.878
You and I are six months down
the road and I'm telling you

30:46.911 --> 30:48.980
{\an1}I have never been
more in control in my life.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.982
{\an1}And the anger management tools
we worked on,

30:51.015 --> 30:53.317
{\an1}any outbursts
or irrational behavior?

30:53.350 --> 30:56.220
-Not even once.
-All right.

30:56.253 --> 30:59.891
Just remember no matter
how enraged you get,

30:59.924 --> 31:01.392
smile through your anger.

31:01.425 --> 31:04.095
Smile, it's the key
to your healing.

31:04.128 --> 31:07.198
Good day to you Doc Chu.

31:07.231 --> 31:09.634
Baby, I'm so proud of you.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.036
I know how hard it is
to control your anger

31:12.069 --> 31:15.106
{\an1}and giving up football
and wagering

31:15.139 --> 31:17.074
{\an1}-was impossible too.
-Thanks, babe.

31:17.107 --> 31:19.977
{\an1}I just want you to know
that it doesn't go unnoticed.

31:20.010 --> 31:21.279
Now roll over.

31:21.312 --> 31:23.014
Okay.

31:25.516 --> 31:26.651
(sighing)

31:28.652 --> 31:31.522
Is it tight, my semimembranosus?

31:31.555 --> 31:34.292
Mhm.

31:34.325 --> 31:36.093
Is Skull bringing Lucy?

31:36.126 --> 31:37.295
I mentioned it to her yesterday,

31:37.328 --> 31:39.096
but I wasn't sure
she was going to go

31:39.129 --> 31:40.698
because of the whole
foot-breaking thing.

31:40.731 --> 31:44.435
-Uh, unlike you?
-I love it!

31:44.468 --> 31:46.103
{\an1}You think he's gonna ask
her again?

31:46.136 --> 31:47.171
Who knows with that guy.

31:47.204 --> 31:48.105
He was probably going to

31:48.139 --> 31:49.306
{\an1}and then cartoons came on
or something.

31:49.340 --> 31:51.609
{\an1}Hey, what do you think of
the new Halloween show masks?

31:51.642 --> 31:53.511
-Tres sexy.
-I know, right?

31:53.544 --> 31:55.112
This old gypsy lady
sold them to me.

31:55.145 --> 31:57.048
Said they were filled
with a spooky magic.

31:57.081 --> 32:00.184
{\an1}Well, if spooky magic makes you
not piss on the toilet seat

32:00.217 --> 32:02.153
{\an1}in the middle of the night,
then I'm all for it.

32:02.186 --> 32:05.156
{\an1}The urologist told you
I have an oddly shaped urethra,

32:05.189 --> 32:07.291
you insensitive witch.

32:07.324 --> 32:09.327
Has he seen the new masks yet?

32:09.360 --> 32:11.062
{\an1}I don't think
he's gonna like them.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.196
Are you kidding me?

32:12.229 --> 32:13.698
He's gonna love them.

32:13.731 --> 32:15.032
I hate 'em.

32:15.065 --> 32:17.435
I think you look badass.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.270
{\an1}-You really think so?
-I know so.

32:19.303 --> 32:22.173
{\an1}I think it's badass and it makes
you look like a superhero.

32:22.206 --> 32:24.508
Well, as long as you like it.

32:24.541 --> 32:26.377
{\an1}You don't think it makes me
look goofy, do you?

32:26.410 --> 32:28.546
Babe, you love Goofy.

32:28.579 --> 32:32.717
Yeah, he is my favorite.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.419
{\an1}Look, Luce, thanks for coming
to the match tonight.

32:35.452 --> 32:36.553
I know you didn't want to

32:36.587 --> 32:38.322
{\an1}after I snapped that guy's
foot off and all that.

32:38.355 --> 32:42.460
{\an1}Just do me a favor,
no more bone breaking.

32:42.493 --> 32:44.595
Shouldn't we be getting ready?

32:44.628 --> 32:45.829
Don't want to be late.

32:45.863 --> 32:48.099
Oh, I don't give a flying shit,
I never had to be at a match

32:48.132 --> 32:49.700
{\an1}freakin' four hours
early before.

32:49.733 --> 32:51.369
Why so early?

32:51.402 --> 32:53.504
Vic did this bullshit gimmick

32:53.537 --> 32:56.707
{\an1}where he charged a bunch of fans
up the wazoo for VIP tickets

32:56.740 --> 32:59.076
and they get to come in early
and take pictures in the cage

32:59.109 --> 33:01.379
{\an1}with all the wrestlers
and all that crap.

33:03.147 --> 33:06.083
-Hey, Luce.
-Yeah, babe?

33:06.116 --> 33:07.218
You know I love you right?

33:07.251 --> 33:09.553
{\an1}Yes, honey,
you tell me all the time.

33:09.586 --> 33:12.590
{\an1}Well, I mean, you're not bored
or nothing are you?

33:12.623 --> 33:15.259
Bored?

33:15.292 --> 33:18.095
Okay, what's going on?

33:18.128 --> 33:19.630
{\an1}Well, we been together
a long time

33:19.663 --> 33:22.266
and I just want to make sure
you feel filled up, that's all.

33:22.299 --> 33:24.135
-Fulfilled?
-Yeah, that.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.569
Well, do ya?

33:25.602 --> 33:28.439
{\an9}♪

33:28.472 --> 33:31.442
I'm exactly where I want to be.

33:31.475 --> 33:33.177
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

33:33.210 --> 33:35.713
{\an1}I'm stupidly in love
with a wrestler.

33:35.746 --> 33:37.448
Oh, please tell me
it's not that guy

33:37.481 --> 33:39.150
{\an1}who used to punch his munchkin
in the shitter

33:39.183 --> 33:40.651
before every match.

33:40.684 --> 33:41.752
No, Carlos.

33:41.785 --> 33:43.220
Not the munchkin puncher.

33:43.253 --> 33:44.655
I'm talking about you.

33:44.688 --> 33:47.458
Oh, aces.

33:47.491 --> 33:49.260
Did you really mean it last week

33:49.293 --> 33:52.229
{\an1}when you said that I was
the star in your sky?

33:52.262 --> 33:53.431
Yeah.

33:53.464 --> 33:55.466
{\an1}The one my whole planet
revolves around.

33:55.499 --> 33:57.735
Then don't worry.

33:57.768 --> 33:59.537
We're perfect together.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.505
Like two peas in a bush?

34:01.538 --> 34:03.274
In a pod, sweetheart.

34:03.307 --> 34:04.742
In a pod.

34:04.775 --> 34:08.212
{\an9}♪

34:08.245 --> 34:11.748
{\an1}After significant warning,
this was imminent.

34:11.782 --> 34:13.451
That storm front from the west

34:13.484 --> 34:17.221
{\an1}has finally met that storm front
from the northeast.

34:17.254 --> 34:20.291
{\an1}What we have now
is a monster of a storm,

34:20.324 --> 34:24.328
the likes of which Santa Fe
hasn't seen for decades.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.862
Lock up your trick or treaters.

34:25.896 --> 34:27.797
Batten down the hatches.

34:27.831 --> 34:30.668
The storm of the century
appears to be upon us.

34:30.701 --> 34:31.835
Fake news.

34:31.869 --> 34:34.271
Scott, back to you.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.641
(indistinct remarks)

34:37.774 --> 34:38.641
Thank you.

34:38.675 --> 34:40.511
All right, congratulations.

34:40.543 --> 34:42.146
Thank you.

34:42.179 --> 34:44.815
All right, thank you.

34:44.848 --> 34:47.784
Thank you, thank you.

34:47.818 --> 34:49.253
Happy Halloween.

34:49.286 --> 34:52.223
(thunder rumbling)

34:52.255 --> 34:53.556
{\an1}Thump you want to go through
our match?

34:53.590 --> 34:55.726
In a minute, Eddie.

34:57.694 --> 34:58.562
Ace-Queen.

34:58.595 --> 34:59.697
Blackjack, Thump.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.465
Yeah, I know what
Ace-Queen means.

35:01.498 --> 35:03.401
Deal them again.

35:09.173 --> 35:11.909
{\an9}♪

35:11.942 --> 35:13.911
-Shit, blackjack.
-Gotta love that.

35:13.944 --> 35:15.479
Two in a row, lucky.

35:15.512 --> 35:16.914
{\an1}Too bad you guys aren't playing
for real money.

35:16.947 --> 35:18.115
Yeah, too bad, Eddie.

35:18.148 --> 35:20.851
{\an1}How about you just watch and
spare us the fucking commentary?

35:20.884 --> 35:23.521
Sorry, Thump.

35:23.554 --> 35:24.755
Throw them again.

35:24.788 --> 35:26.290
Odds are in my favor.

35:26.323 --> 35:27.791
Lady luck.

35:27.824 --> 35:33.364
{\an9}♪

35:33.397 --> 35:34.832
It's like supernatural.

35:34.865 --> 35:36.367
{\an1}You stacking the deck,
motherfucker?

35:36.400 --> 35:37.335
Thump, I swear to God,

35:37.368 --> 35:38.869
{\an1}if it makes you feel better
you can deal.

35:38.902 --> 35:41.238
{\an1}Yeah, it will make me
feel better.

35:41.271 --> 35:42.606
Twice is lucky.

35:42.639 --> 35:43.774
A trifecta,

35:43.807 --> 35:46.877
that's a miracle from God
for a schlimazel like you.

35:46.910 --> 35:48.445
Schlimazel?

35:48.478 --> 35:49.680
Unlucky.

35:49.713 --> 35:51.282
I wish I was unlucky like you.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.750
Five-time tag champ.

35:52.783 --> 35:54.652
Smoking hot girlfriend.

35:54.685 --> 35:57.822
{\an1}And beating Thump's ass
at blackjack.

36:16.907 --> 36:18.976
That, that just ain't natural.

36:19.009 --> 36:21.645
Holy shit.

36:21.678 --> 36:24.515
{\an1}That is like
outer space stuff now.

36:24.548 --> 36:26.784
{\an1}I thought I told you
to put a fucking cork in it.

36:26.817 --> 36:30.287
{\an1}I'm sorry, Thump, but you gotta
admit it's pretty cool.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.755
{\an1}Do you want to go over
our match now?

36:31.788 --> 36:35.226
Ask me that again, motherfucker.

36:35.259 --> 36:36.860
{\an1}You know what,
fuck your stupid game.

36:36.893 --> 36:39.530
{\an1}Stoney, you want to play,
do me a favor.

36:39.563 --> 36:40.864
Shuffle those cards real good.

36:40.897 --> 36:43.500
{\an1}Cut them and shove 'em
right up your ass.

36:43.533 --> 36:46.204
Come on, Thump, don't get bent.

36:50.307 --> 36:51.375
(door slamming)

36:51.408 --> 36:53.544
Jesus, he hates to lose.

36:56.980 --> 36:58.449
What?

36:58.482 --> 36:59.450
Nothing.

36:59.483 --> 37:00.884
Just a little odd is all.

37:00.917 --> 37:02.853
It's dumb luck.

37:02.886 --> 37:04.655
If you say so.

37:04.688 --> 37:07.458
{\an1}I've never had dumb luck
like that.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.560
Nope, not old Eddie.

37:09.593 --> 37:10.861
Here we go.

37:10.894 --> 37:13.330
{\an1}The only luck
I've ever had is bad.

37:13.363 --> 37:16.700
B-A-D, shitty.

37:16.733 --> 37:19.403
Glass is half full, my ass.

37:21.004 --> 37:24.541
{\an1}Hey, did somebody hide
my lunchbox again?

37:24.574 --> 37:27.411
Come on, man.

37:27.444 --> 37:29.780
This is bullshit!

37:29.813 --> 37:32.350
(rain pattering)

37:33.483 --> 37:35.253
Chip Abernathy, VIP.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.890
{\an1}-Pretty brutal out there, huh?
-Good.

37:39.923 --> 37:44.061
Can see you got some higher
education behind you, huh?

37:44.094 --> 37:46.630
You confused there, boss?

37:46.663 --> 37:49.700
This is a golden VIP ticket.

37:49.733 --> 37:52.303
{\an1}Once again, your powerful grasp
of the apparent

37:52.336 --> 37:54.672
is just astounding.

37:54.705 --> 37:57.708
{\an1}Yes, this is a golden
VIP ticket.

37:57.741 --> 38:00.444
{\an1}You do know what VIP stands
for don't you?

38:00.477 --> 38:03.681
Yes, it means it's for two seats
but there's three in your party.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.649
And he counts.

38:05.682 --> 38:07.051
{\an1}This guy's worse
than the fucking guy

38:07.084 --> 38:09.420
{\an1}we gave 50 bucks to
at the valet.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.754
We don't have valet.

38:10.787 --> 38:12.589
What's that, chief?

38:12.622 --> 38:14.425
Nothing.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.094
{\an1}Maybe we should hire this guy
at the firm, huh?

38:17.127 --> 38:19.963
{\an1}Yes, there are three of us,
good.

38:19.996 --> 38:24.068
Well, you need another ticket.

38:24.101 --> 38:26.970
{\an1}All right, look, I know
Vic Quickbuck personally, okay?

38:27.003 --> 38:29.406
And unless you want a job
lower on the social ladder

38:29.439 --> 38:33.577
{\an1}than this one here,
then go find our fucking seats.

38:33.610 --> 38:35.346
You still with me, minimum wage?

38:35.379 --> 38:37.481
{\an9}♪

38:37.514 --> 38:39.550
Follow me.

38:39.583 --> 38:40.884
Thank you.

38:40.917 --> 38:47.791
{\an9}♪

38:47.824 --> 38:50.361
(indistinct chatter)

38:59.603 --> 39:00.738
(sighing)

39:04.741 --> 39:07.978
{\an1}Maybe these masks
are full of a spooky magic.

39:11.081 --> 39:12.950
Hey, Shitty, check this out.

39:14.751 --> 39:16.687
Yeah, so?

39:16.720 --> 39:17.821
{\an1}Watch close,
I'm gonna do it again.

39:17.854 --> 39:19.924
{\an1}I'm drawing 21
like 10 times in a row.

39:22.192 --> 39:23.360
Well?

39:23.393 --> 39:25.829
Look we talked about this
gambling thing, didn't we?

39:25.862 --> 39:27.531
{\an1}Do I have to do
a family invention with you?

39:27.564 --> 39:28.665
Intervention.

39:28.699 --> 39:31.668
{\an1}Look, put the damn cards away
and grow up, will ya?

39:31.701 --> 39:32.836
Look, you don't understand.

39:32.869 --> 39:35.839
This is some really trippy shit.

39:35.872 --> 39:37.775
(toilet flushing)

39:37.808 --> 39:39.710
Well, we got a card change.

39:39.743 --> 39:42.846
Jack is out--ahh!

39:42.879 --> 39:45.115
{\an1}Did you eat a dead possum
or a dirty diaper or something?

39:45.148 --> 39:48.051
-Good God.
-Wasabi peas.

39:48.084 --> 39:49.219
I've been trying Jack all week.

39:49.252 --> 39:51.755
{\an1}He hasn't been answering
my calls or calling me back.

39:51.788 --> 39:53.090
-He's a no show.
-No show?

39:53.123 --> 39:54.091
That guy never misses a bout.

39:54.124 --> 39:56.560
He even worked a match
with meningitis once.

39:56.593 --> 39:58.162
{\an1}Hey, was he that guy
with the real stinky feet

39:58.195 --> 39:59.863
{\an1}who wouldn't take his boots off
in the locker room?

39:59.896 --> 40:01.832
{\an1}What in the fuck
are you talking about?

40:01.865 --> 40:03.834
{\an1}The guy when Jack wrestled
with meningitis.

40:03.867 --> 40:05.569
Meningitis is a brain
inflammation, genius.

40:05.602 --> 40:06.637
{\an1}-Not a guy.
-Well, the guy with

40:06.670 --> 40:08.205
{\an1}the real stinky feet
was a shitty worker anyway.

40:08.238 --> 40:13.110
{\an1}This is why we say the card
is subject to change.

40:13.143 --> 40:15.546
We put in Evil Dutch for Jack.

40:15.579 --> 40:18.549
{\an1}The marks love that
psychotic fucker, right?

40:18.582 --> 40:20.651
{\an1}And then it becomes a gimmick
that you guys

40:20.684 --> 40:22.119
{\an1}don't know who
you're wrestling against.

40:22.152 --> 40:23.854
{\an1}Yeah, we can do the whole
"bring on anybody

40:23.887 --> 40:25.589
{\an1}with the balls enough to face
the Manson Brothers."

40:25.622 --> 40:26.790
{\an1}You announce Evil Dutch
and we'll be like,

40:26.823 --> 40:30.160
"Oh no, holy shit, don't do it."

40:30.193 --> 40:32.729
And then when we announce
his partner's going to be

40:32.762 --> 40:34.998
Carson the Crippler Murdock,

40:35.031 --> 40:36.633
the fans will tear the roof off!

40:36.666 --> 40:39.236
{\an1}Yeah, they will go apeshit
when you announce--

40:39.269 --> 40:40.737
wait a minute, Carson?

40:40.770 --> 40:41.971
Did I just fucking
hear you correctly?

40:42.005 --> 40:43.941
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Carson's
gonna be Dutch's partner.

40:43.974 --> 40:46.076
{\an1}-Ooh, aces.
-Hold on, hold on.

40:46.109 --> 40:47.778
Carson's in WWO.

40:47.811 --> 40:49.012
{\an1}How'd you get them
to loan him out

40:49.045 --> 40:50.246
{\an1}and why would
he come here anyway?

40:50.280 --> 40:52.549
Well, I just told him who he
was gonna be wrestling against

40:52.582 --> 40:54.618
{\an1}-and he said he was in.
-Yeah, well, with this storm,

40:54.651 --> 40:57.120
Carson's probably holed up
in Beverly Hills or Bel Air

40:57.153 --> 40:59.223
{\an1}or whatever fucking hoity-toity
town he lives in.

40:59.256 --> 41:00.991
Oh no, he's been here for hours.

41:01.024 --> 41:03.727
He was meditating in his private
dressing room when I got here.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.962
Meditating?

41:04.995 --> 41:06.263
Private dressing room?

41:06.296 --> 41:09.533
He had a rider.

41:09.566 --> 41:11.835
I heard this music,

41:11.868 --> 41:14.972
and I poked my head in...

41:15.005 --> 41:17.274
and he was there.

41:17.307 --> 41:24.882
{\an9}♪

41:24.915 --> 41:27.518
Oh, hey Carson.

41:27.551 --> 41:29.219
Eddie.

41:29.252 --> 41:31.255
Come in.

41:31.288 --> 41:34.992
{\an9}♪

41:35.025 --> 41:36.159
Come.

41:36.192 --> 41:37.861
Sit.

41:37.894 --> 41:44.535
{\an9}♪

41:44.568 --> 41:46.937
Meditate with me.

41:46.970 --> 41:48.171
Let's join souls.

41:48.204 --> 41:50.173
{\an9}♪

41:50.206 --> 41:51.675
Can I?

41:51.708 --> 41:53.877
{\an9}♪

41:53.910 --> 41:56.280
(breathing deeply)

41:56.313 --> 42:01.552
{\an9}♪

42:01.585 --> 42:03.854
Carson, what are we looking for?

42:03.887 --> 42:06.256
Emptiness, Eddie.

42:06.289 --> 42:11.828
Just blissful emptiness.

42:11.861 --> 42:14.131
Oh yeah, emptiness.

42:14.164 --> 42:16.266
Sure.

42:16.299 --> 42:18.902
{\an1}Pretty much my whole life
is empty.

42:18.935 --> 42:23.707
And our souls joined.

42:23.740 --> 42:25.676
(sighing)

42:25.709 --> 42:27.311
And it was beautiful, man.

42:27.344 --> 42:30.581
Did I just cross over into
the fucking twilight zone?

42:30.614 --> 42:32.849
{\an1}And why didn't you tell me
he was here, captain?

42:32.882 --> 42:34.217
Hey, I thought you knew.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.787
{\an1}Vic, you're a real conivorator,
I'll give you that.

42:36.820 --> 42:38.322
Somebody translate that for me.

42:38.355 --> 42:39.990
{\an1}I'll be happy
to translate it for you.

42:40.023 --> 42:41.892
{\an1}He means you're a sneaky
little dog fucker,

42:41.925 --> 42:43.193
you fucking dog fucker.

42:43.226 --> 42:46.029
{\an1}For the last time,
I did not fuck your dog.

42:46.062 --> 42:48.065
{\an1}-Mhm.
-It was a cuddle.

42:48.098 --> 42:49.900
{\an1}You know it's a great matchup,
you know it!

42:49.933 --> 42:50.934
{\an1}Yeah, I know
it's a great matchup

42:50.968 --> 42:52.936
{\an1}but you could have
told us first, right, Skull?

42:52.969 --> 42:54.037
Oh, I don't give a shit.

42:54.070 --> 42:55.973
I swear to God sometimes
you were put on this earth

42:56.006 --> 42:57.941
{\an1}-just to fuck with me.
-Calm down.

42:57.974 --> 42:58.842
It's a good match.

42:58.875 --> 43:00.811
{\an1}Don't tell me to calm down,
Carlos.

43:00.844 --> 43:04.781
{\an1}Evil Dutch Decker
and Carson the Crippler Murdock!

43:04.814 --> 43:06.383
The main event!

43:06.416 --> 43:07.351
I smell money!

43:07.384 --> 43:10.787
{\an1}We're not done with
this conversation, Vic.

43:10.820 --> 43:12.322
Lord Thurman Ruggles.

43:12.355 --> 43:14.324
{\an1}-What?
-Lord Thurman Ruggles.

43:14.357 --> 43:16.360
{\an1}The guy with
the real stinky feet.

43:16.393 --> 43:18.829
{\an1}Lord Thurman--
who gives a dripping shit

43:18.862 --> 43:20.797
about Lord Thurman Ruggles?

43:20.830 --> 43:24.101
{\an1}I heard when
Lord Thurman Ruggles died,

43:24.134 --> 43:26.236
{\an1}the funeral director
made the coroner

43:26.269 --> 43:29.740
{\an1}cut off his feet before
they put him in the casket.

43:29.773 --> 43:31.308
Then they cremated the feet

43:31.341 --> 43:33.076
{\an1}and flushed the ashes
down the toilet.

43:33.109 --> 43:35.779
{\an1}Fucking guy's buried
with no feet.

43:35.812 --> 43:37.781
{\an1}Do you think they're reunited
in heaven?

43:37.814 --> 43:39.850
{\an1}Yeah, of course,
it says so right in the Bible.

43:41.918 --> 43:44.788
{\an1}If I have to hear one more thing
about Lord Thurman Ruggles

43:44.821 --> 43:47.791
{\an1}and his stinky disembodied
motherfucking feet,

43:47.824 --> 43:50.027
I swear to God, I will beat
the shit out of both of you

43:50.060 --> 43:51.762
with a sack full of frozen peas.

43:51.795 --> 43:53.830
Okay, okay!

43:53.863 --> 43:56.900
Sorry, geez-o-pete.

43:56.933 --> 44:01.005
Everybody's coming down
on old Captain Marvelous.

44:02.706 --> 44:04.141
Fuck.

44:04.174 --> 44:06.710
(groaning)

44:08.812 --> 44:11.148
(gurgling)

44:14.350 --> 44:15.852
(whistling)

44:15.885 --> 44:18.221
Hey, class valedictorian,

44:18.254 --> 44:19.423
{\an1}you know where the hell
you're going, man?

44:19.456 --> 44:20.424
We'd like to get to our seats

44:20.457 --> 44:23.760
{\an1}sometime before the second
coming of Christ.

44:23.793 --> 44:26.129
Maybe in this shithole
these are the VIP seats.

44:26.162 --> 44:27.764
(groaning)

44:27.797 --> 44:29.199
Hey chief, you ok down there?

44:29.232 --> 44:30.434
You gotta take a piss?

44:30.467 --> 44:31.735
Your tummy cramping?

44:31.768 --> 44:33.203
You starting your period?

44:33.236 --> 44:35.105
Gotta go poopy?

44:35.138 --> 44:38.408
(gurgling)

44:38.441 --> 44:41.278
He's gonna shit himself.

44:41.311 --> 44:43.880
{\an1}Hey, future fry guy,
just give me the tickets, okay?

44:43.913 --> 44:45.114
We'll find out own seats.

44:45.148 --> 44:49.886
You seem to be dealing with
a lot of business down there.

44:49.919 --> 44:52.222
Hey, hey.

44:52.255 --> 44:54.157
{\an1}I can't believe Vic pulled
that "okey doke" on us

44:54.190 --> 44:55.192
and you didn't even give a shit.

44:55.225 --> 44:56.426
Oh, why should I give a shit?

44:56.459 --> 44:58.128
It was just a stupid match.

44:58.161 --> 44:59.796
God love you, you are simple.

44:59.829 --> 45:00.731
You guys talking
about that thing

45:00.764 --> 45:01.998
when Carson tapped out Skull?

45:02.031 --> 45:03.934
He never tapped him out.

45:03.967 --> 45:05.936
{\an1}For the last fucking time,
he won on points

45:05.969 --> 45:08.071
{\an1}and only because
dingle berry here let him.

45:08.104 --> 45:09.740
Carson's been ringing
his own bell about it

45:09.773 --> 45:12.142
for the last 20 goddamn years.

45:12.175 --> 45:14.845
{\an1}Someone ringing their own bell
in this business?

45:14.878 --> 45:17.981
Good Christmas, what next?

45:18.014 --> 45:21.017
(gurgling)

45:21.050 --> 45:22.886
Are you speaking Pig Latin?

45:22.919 --> 45:25.756
(laughing)

45:25.789 --> 45:28.425
{\an1}What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

45:28.458 --> 45:30.827
-Shit.
-Fuck.

45:30.860 --> 45:32.763
{\an9}♪

45:32.796 --> 45:34.998
(snarling)

46:47.604 --> 46:50.106
We were just talking about
when Carson tapped out Skull

46:50.139 --> 46:51.007
in that shoot match.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.110
{\an1}Now there's someone
I don't miss.

46:54.143 --> 46:56.379
You don't know either?

46:56.412 --> 46:57.480
What don't I now?

46:57.513 --> 46:59.349
Carson is the mystery partner.

46:59.382 --> 47:01.484
{\an1}-Are you yanking my chain?
-I wish he was.

47:01.517 --> 47:03.854
{\an1}Who's his partner
now that Jack's out?

47:03.887 --> 47:05.922
-Dutch.
-Dutch?

47:05.955 --> 47:08.325
Dutch and Carson
against you guys?

47:08.358 --> 47:11.094
{\an1}Damn, that's
pretty good booking.

47:11.127 --> 47:13.363
{\an1}It's great booking,
I just can't stand his whole

47:13.396 --> 47:15.432
"I'm an old-school hooker,
I tapped out Skull Manson"

47:15.465 --> 47:17.000
messianic complex bullshittery.

47:17.033 --> 47:17.934
Yeah, you know that shit

47:17.968 --> 47:20.003
{\an1}about him tapping out Skull
is nonsense.

47:20.036 --> 47:21.071
{\an1}Yeah, well,
I know it's nonsense

47:21.104 --> 47:21.772
and you know it's nonsense,

47:21.805 --> 47:22.839
but trying telling Carson that.

47:22.873 --> 47:25.308
-Try telling Carson what?
-Carson, right on cue,

47:25.341 --> 47:26.977
just like the movies, buddy.

47:27.010 --> 47:28.545
{\an1}We were just talking
about your big match with Skull

47:28.578 --> 47:30.380
back in '92.

47:30.413 --> 47:32.015
Oh, yeah.

47:32.048 --> 47:33.550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one?

47:33.583 --> 47:36.953
{\an1}Yeah, that was just
a classic textbook case

47:36.986 --> 47:38.588
of how superior technique

47:38.621 --> 47:42.025
will always overcome
your brute strength.

47:42.058 --> 47:44.294
{\an1}All comes down
to the proper training, guys.

47:44.327 --> 47:46.529
{\an1}Really should've
trained him better, Thump.

47:46.562 --> 47:47.898
More training.

47:47.931 --> 47:49.432
That's how it was.

47:49.465 --> 47:51.201
Yeah, is that how it was?

47:51.234 --> 47:52.569
{\an1}Maybe you and Skull should do
another round now

47:52.602 --> 47:53.970
and find out for sure.

47:54.003 --> 47:55.906
{\an1}-Ah, relax, Thump.
-Yeah, Thump.

47:55.939 --> 47:57.474
{\an1}Skull doesn't want
to get embarrassed again.

47:57.507 --> 48:00.010
-No, I don't.
-Really?

48:00.043 --> 48:01.478
Well, I mean, I don't.

48:01.511 --> 48:05.015
{\an1}-Jesus, really?
-Who wants to be embarrassed?

48:05.048 --> 48:07.317
{\an1}Just gonna drop off these
new publicity shots for Vic.

48:07.350 --> 48:09.887
(indistinct chatter)

48:11.554 --> 48:14.157
{\an1}Say this much for you,
you certainly come prepared.

48:14.190 --> 48:17.127
{\an1}-Aw. That's for you.
-Thanks.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.128
Those are nice.

48:21.464 --> 48:24.467
Guys, I get it, okay?

48:24.500 --> 48:26.569
You guys are all a little
envious and intimidated

48:26.602 --> 48:28.605
{\an1}by my star power and success
in this industry.

48:28.638 --> 48:29.606
It's only natural.

48:29.639 --> 48:30.707
I mean, I've seen me.

48:30.740 --> 48:34.678
{\an1}And, then, there I am
up in New York at the big show,

48:34.711 --> 48:36.947
{\an1}million-dollar contracts,
endorsement deals,

48:36.980 --> 48:38.648
{\an1}suits that cost
more than your houses,

48:38.681 --> 48:43.320
{\an1}I mean, well, your trailers,
and you guys are here.

48:43.353 --> 48:44.487
I get it, okay?

48:44.520 --> 48:45.555
Oh, you're gonna
fucking get it.

48:45.588 --> 48:48.291
{\an1}-Calm down, Thump.
-Better listen to him, Thump.

48:48.324 --> 48:49.659
Man of your advanced age,

48:49.692 --> 48:51.461
{\an1}wouldn't want you popping
an aneurysm.

48:51.494 --> 48:53.997
You know, the enfeebled are
prone to subdural hematomas,

48:54.030 --> 48:55.966
hip fractures.

48:55.999 --> 48:57.968
{\an1}The other day, we had a guy
that was just like you

48:58.001 --> 48:59.669
{\an1}who also should've been
in a nursing home.

48:59.702 --> 49:01.471
That's it!

49:01.504 --> 49:04.341
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

49:04.374 --> 49:06.609
{\an1}Hey! Maybe you haven't
heard the news,

49:06.642 --> 49:08.578
but I don't sweat you. See?

49:08.611 --> 49:10.113
{\an1}I mean, don't get me wrong,
you used to be great

49:10.146 --> 49:11.481
maybe like a hundred years ago,

49:11.514 --> 49:13.583
{\an1}but now you're just
like every other washed-up,

49:13.616 --> 49:14.617
over-the-hill has-been

49:14.651 --> 49:17.220
{\an1}that should've hung up his boots
two decades ago.

49:17.253 --> 49:18.588
{\an1}Why don't you do us
all a favor?

49:18.621 --> 49:20.523
Go home. Change your diapers,

49:20.556 --> 49:22.192
{\an1}watch The Golden Girls
marathon,

49:22.225 --> 49:24.227
{\an1}and stop embarrassing yourself,
okay?

49:24.260 --> 49:25.362
Save your breath, jabroni.

49:25.395 --> 49:26.596
{\an1}You're gonna need it
to blow around

49:26.629 --> 49:28.565
{\an1}-your fucking wheelchair.
-Come on, guys,

49:28.598 --> 49:30.633
{\an1}we're all still friends here,
right?

49:30.666 --> 49:33.269
Yeah, yeah.

49:33.302 --> 49:34.437
We're all friends here.

49:34.470 --> 49:37.040
{\an1}We're just grab-assing
a little bit, right, Thump?

49:37.073 --> 49:38.408
Maybe next time.

49:38.441 --> 49:41.411
Bet on it, pencil dick.

49:41.444 --> 49:42.645
{\an1}Why don't you do us
all a favor

49:42.678 --> 49:44.147
and shut the fucker's yap?

49:44.180 --> 49:46.049
{\an1}Ah, Thump, I got no beef
with him.

49:46.082 --> 49:48.318
{\an1}Who told you to put up
with shit like that anyway?

49:48.351 --> 49:49.719
You.

49:49.752 --> 49:52.522
Oh, fuck me anyway.
Hey, sweetheart.

49:52.555 --> 49:53.690
{\an1}Thump, can we go through
our match now?

49:53.723 --> 49:55.425
Eddie, stop busting my balls.

49:55.458 --> 49:57.193
You're worse than having a kid.

49:57.226 --> 49:58.228
Luce, you made it.

49:58.261 --> 49:59.629
He convinced me this morning.

49:59.662 --> 50:01.798
{\an1}He can be a bit
of a procrastinator.

50:01.831 --> 50:03.333
Babe, I told you
it was one time.

50:03.366 --> 50:04.267
{\an1}You were out of town
for a whole week

50:04.301 --> 50:06.069
{\an1}and you left
your lingerie magazines out.

50:06.102 --> 50:07.270
You got to tell everybody?

50:07.303 --> 50:08.705
Oh, honey, don't be embarrassed.

50:08.738 --> 50:09.939
Everybody does it.

50:09.973 --> 50:12.275
{\an1}Hey, Lucy, there's always
the Witness Protection Program

50:12.308 --> 50:13.410
-if you need it.
-Yeah,

50:13.443 --> 50:14.477
or you can just go ahead

50:14.510 --> 50:15.712
{\an1}and give it another shot
with me.

50:15.745 --> 50:16.746
I'm still single, you know?

50:16.779 --> 50:19.349
-Shocking.
-I know, right?

50:19.382 --> 50:21.184
{\an1}I mean, hey, babe,
you already blew your shot,

50:21.217 --> 50:24.287
but I could make an exception
if you want to try it again.

50:24.320 --> 50:28.058
{\an1}As appealing as that sounds,
I think I'll pass.

50:28.091 --> 50:30.160
{\an1}-Your loss.
-Mins, any fans out there?

50:30.193 --> 50:31.828
{\an1}The contest winners
are starting to trickle in,

50:31.861 --> 50:33.496
{\an1}but I heard
it's gonna be slammed

50:33.529 --> 50:35.365
-once the doors open.
-We've got a problem.

50:35.398 --> 50:37.167
-Again?
-What's that?

50:37.200 --> 50:39.602
They just issued a warning
for the storm of the century.

50:39.635 --> 50:42.138
They're telling people
to find someplace safe

50:42.171 --> 50:43.540
{\an1}-and hunker down.
-Come on,

50:43.573 --> 50:44.641
where'd you hear that from?

50:44.674 --> 50:46.376
Captain Miserable's boom box.

50:46.409 --> 50:47.710
{\an1}You're sure
it's not just a drizzle then?

50:47.743 --> 50:49.079
Oh, no, it's legit.

50:49.112 --> 50:50.413
I turned on the TV after.

50:50.446 --> 50:51.648
We are so close!

50:51.681 --> 50:53.583
Feel like this is
a bad joke now.

50:53.616 --> 50:54.784
First, Jack goes missing.

50:54.817 --> 50:55.651
Then, Dutch gets sick.

50:55.685 --> 50:57.520
And now the storm
may shut us down!

50:57.553 --> 50:59.556
Wait a minute. Dutch is sick?

50:59.589 --> 51:02.525
Yeah, he felt like a whore's
leaky nose since he got here.

51:02.558 --> 51:03.660
Drinking tons of water.

51:03.693 --> 51:05.495
{\an1}I got to get him
another case right now.

51:05.528 --> 51:06.596
{\an1}Let us know
if you need any help.

51:06.629 --> 51:08.465
Yeah, help, as if.

51:08.498 --> 51:10.100
Captain Miserable?

51:10.133 --> 51:11.401
The guy with the cape?

51:11.434 --> 51:13.236
Our very own Captain Marvelous.

51:13.269 --> 51:15.138
One of those rare individuals
that has the ability to make

51:15.171 --> 51:17.207
{\an1}everybody feel like shit
just by walking in the room.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.475
He's one of them guys.

51:18.508 --> 51:20.143
He walks into your house

51:20.176 --> 51:22.212
and all your fucking plants die.

51:22.245 --> 51:24.481
{\an1}It's true.
Come on, we'll show you.

51:24.514 --> 51:25.648
{\an9}♪

51:25.681 --> 51:27.117
Shh.

51:27.150 --> 51:28.485
{\an9}♪

51:28.518 --> 51:30.787
(groans)

51:30.820 --> 51:32.188
{\an1}I'm starting to understand
why this place

51:32.221 --> 51:35.325
always smells like shit.

51:35.358 --> 51:42.599
{\an9}♪

51:42.632 --> 51:44.134
Hey, Eddie, what are you doing?

51:44.167 --> 51:45.635
Trying to figure out
my match with Thump.

51:45.668 --> 51:47.403
{\an1}He likes to call it
in the ring.

51:47.436 --> 51:49.172
{\an1}Hey, listen,
I heard you won 25 grand

51:49.205 --> 51:50.640
{\an1}on a scratch-off lottery ticket
last month.

51:50.673 --> 51:52.442
That was such bullshit.

51:52.475 --> 51:55.445
{\an1}I missed 30 grand
by one fucking number.

51:55.478 --> 51:58.214
Had to give two grand
to my bitch ex-wife.

51:58.247 --> 52:00.483
Only got 15 grand after taxes.

52:00.516 --> 52:02.519
{\an1}I mean, what the fuck
is the point?

52:02.552 --> 52:04.921
{\an1}Might as well flush the ticket
down the crapper.

52:04.954 --> 52:07.190
Old Eddie getting screwed again.

52:07.223 --> 52:08.458
Oh, come on.

52:08.491 --> 52:10.226
You're still working, right?

52:10.259 --> 52:12.362
This business is such bullshit.

52:12.395 --> 52:15.465
I mean, how do people
believe this crap?

52:15.498 --> 52:17.567
Seriously, it's such bullshit.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.269
It's so fake.

52:20.736 --> 52:22.772
Ah.

52:23.906 --> 52:25.275
The whole thing sucks.

52:25.308 --> 52:27.710
Ew, you didn't wipe.

52:27.743 --> 52:30.313
-I just peed.
-You sit to pee?

52:30.346 --> 52:32.582
Yes, but I don't stand to pooh.

52:32.615 --> 52:34.384
Oh, thank God.

52:39.555 --> 52:42.859
{\an1}I think I'm gonna go have
my picture taken by the cage

52:42.892 --> 52:45.695
{\an1}-with Radiant Bobby.
-He's so hot!

52:45.728 --> 52:47.397
Just don't forget
who you're with.

52:47.430 --> 52:50.867
{\an1}One half the most hated tag team
in professional wrestling,

52:50.900 --> 52:52.602
public enemy number one.

52:52.635 --> 52:54.537
And if you think
after all that

52:54.570 --> 52:57.740
{\an1}any other man can catch my eye,
you're crazy, baby.

52:57.773 --> 52:59.876
{\an1}All right, now you're
laying it on a little thick.

52:59.909 --> 53:01.611
-Go have fun.
-Did I mention

53:01.644 --> 53:03.546
he was smoking hot?

53:03.579 --> 53:06.282
{\an1}-Uh, who's smoking hot?
-Witch.

53:06.315 --> 53:10.620
Ah, you make my balls tickle.

53:10.653 --> 53:12.755
{\an1}What the fuck
is the matter with you?

53:12.788 --> 53:13.957
Oh, yeah, um, you know,

53:13.990 --> 53:15.458
{\an1}there's something wrong
with Dutch.

53:15.491 --> 53:16.726
{\an1}He's like catatonic
or something.

53:16.759 --> 53:18.361
{\an9}♪

53:18.394 --> 53:19.862
Hammer!

53:19.895 --> 53:20.997
Hey, what happened?

53:21.030 --> 53:22.565
Did you cut yourself shaving?

53:22.598 --> 53:24.500
{\an1}Oh, I was showing Evil Dutch
this new move,

53:24.533 --> 53:26.469
then all of a sudden,
the fucker bit me.

53:26.502 --> 53:28.538
Wait. He bit you?

53:28.571 --> 53:30.506
{\an1}Yeah, we were locked up
and, suddenly,

53:30.539 --> 53:32.408
I felt a sting in my ear
and he fucking bit me.

53:32.441 --> 53:34.410
{\an1}I mean, it's no big deal,
just broke the skin,

53:34.443 --> 53:35.612
but what the fuck?

53:35.645 --> 53:36.980
He miss a meal or something?

53:37.013 --> 53:38.348
I don't know, man,
but you might want

53:38.381 --> 53:39.449
to get that taped up.

53:39.482 --> 53:40.550
It's no big thing.

53:40.583 --> 53:41.351
I'll just put some glue on it

53:41.384 --> 53:42.785
{\an1}and take some pics
with the fans.

53:42.818 --> 53:45.655
{\an1}Yeah, I mean,
you got two, right?

53:45.688 --> 53:47.690
{\an1}Stoney, saw your girl
out there.

53:47.723 --> 53:49.425
Shit!

53:49.458 --> 53:50.460
{\an1}As long as you see
with your eyes

53:50.493 --> 53:51.894
and not your hands, Holyfield.

53:51.927 --> 53:54.564
You know me, baby.

53:54.597 --> 53:56.466
Dutch gets hungry.

Evil Dutch?

54:07.610 --> 54:09.312
Hey, Dutch?

54:09.345 --> 54:10.947
I've never seen him
like this before.

54:10.980 --> 54:13.683
Yo, Dutch, you okay, brother?

54:13.716 --> 54:15.985
{\an1}Dutch, did you drink
all this water?

54:16.018 --> 54:17.620
Yeah.

54:17.653 --> 54:19.022
Thirsty.

54:19.055 --> 54:20.690
I need some water.

54:20.723 --> 54:21.958
Dutch, did you take

54:21.991 --> 54:24.527
{\an1}all the Chinese
growth hormone shit?

54:24.560 --> 54:28.965
Yeah, I need to get huge again.

54:28.998 --> 54:30.833
I need some water.

54:30.866 --> 54:32.568
Dutch...

54:32.601 --> 54:33.870
Dutch!

54:33.903 --> 54:35.805
-Dutch!
-Oh.

54:38.774 --> 54:41.911
{\an1}Hey, Carson,
when did you get here?

54:41.944 --> 54:45.848
Uh, right about the time
that I said hello to you

54:45.881 --> 54:47.417
out in the hallway.

54:47.450 --> 54:49.852
Oh, yeah, right.

54:49.885 --> 54:53.089
{\an1}Wow, must be getting punchy
or something.

54:53.122 --> 54:56.759
{\an1}Hey, can I get
another case of water?

54:56.792 --> 54:58.795
{\an1}-I'm so damn thirsty.
-Yeah. Yeah, sure, buddy.

54:58.828 --> 55:00.063
{\an1}I'll get you
all the water you want,

55:00.096 --> 55:02.365
but are you sure you're okay?

55:02.398 --> 55:05.435
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

55:07.103 --> 55:09.939
{\an1}You guys ribbing me

55:17.980 --> 55:20.717
{\an1}Yeah, Roy, lay it on me,
what are you doing?

55:20.750 --> 55:22.719
(door closing)

55:22.752 --> 55:25.655
I know, I know, Roy, no, Roy,
Roy, I heard, I heard that.

55:25.688 --> 55:27.590
{\an1}There's got to be somebody
that we can call

55:27.623 --> 55:28.791
and maybe we can get them to...

55:28.824 --> 55:30.093
Roy, are you there?

55:30.126 --> 55:31.861
Shit!

55:31.894 --> 55:33.663
Well, we have another challenge.

55:33.696 --> 55:35.765
{\an1}That was Roy Stroble
from the Wrestling Commission.

55:35.798 --> 55:38.368
-We are officially shut down.
-What do you mean "shut down"?

55:38.401 --> 55:39.469
The storm has been upgraded.

55:39.502 --> 55:40.803
The streets are impassable.

55:40.836 --> 55:42.138
The power is out everywhere.

55:42.171 --> 55:43.840
The city is locked down.

55:43.873 --> 55:45.908
{\an1}-Oh, aces.
-Seems fine here.

55:45.941 --> 55:47.510
Yeah, I know it looks fine here

55:47.543 --> 55:49.379
{\an1}because this place is built
like a fortress.

55:58.888 --> 56:00.456

Okay, what's that mean for us?

56:01.524 --> 56:02.459
What's this mean for us?

56:02.492 --> 56:05.495
What this means for us
is we are cancelado.

56:05.528 --> 56:07.797
{\an1}Nobody can get in here,
nobody can get out of here.

56:07.830 --> 56:09.399
{\an1}So I hope somebody
brought a deck of cards

56:09.432 --> 56:10.700
{\an1}for the pinochle tournament
we are having

56:10.733 --> 56:12.602
{\an1}-because we are locked in.
-Locked in?

56:12.635 --> 56:15.037
-Locked in.
-Oh, no, no, no.

{\an1}Okay. I can't
be locked in here.

56:21.544 --> 56:22.945
Carson, quit hypervaginating.

56:22.978 --> 56:24.680
{\an1}So we're stuck in here
for a little while.

56:24.713 --> 56:25.681
Who gives a crap?

56:25.714 --> 56:26.783
Fuck that, okay?

56:26.816 --> 56:27.917
{\an1}If we are in fact stuck
in here,

56:27.950 --> 56:29.485
{\an1}I'm about to lose my shit,
all right?

56:29.518 --> 56:30.453
The living legend.

56:30.486 --> 56:32.822
{\an1}Hey, you know what?
Fuck you, Stone, okay?

56:32.855 --> 56:34.490
I'm a little tired of all
the condescending bullshit

56:34.523 --> 56:36.192
-you're throwing at me.
-Oh, really? Are ya?

56:36.225 --> 56:37.026
Put a cork in it, will ya?

56:37.059 --> 56:38.027
We don't got time
for this crap.

56:38.060 --> 56:40.897
Wait, if you're pulling
the plug on the match,

56:40.930 --> 56:42.165
what's that mean
about our money?

56:42.198 --> 56:43.800
{\an1}Do I have to draw you
a diagram?

56:43.833 --> 56:45.201
No match, no payout.

56:45.234 --> 56:46.636
That's horseshit, Vic.

56:46.669 --> 56:48.671
{\an1}You gave us a guarantee
based on presales

56:48.704 --> 56:50.740
and our strong names,
you cheap bastard.

56:50.773 --> 56:54.043
{\an1}Wait a second. The presales
have to be refunded.

56:54.076 --> 56:56.579
I got to protect
my good name, okay?

56:56.612 --> 56:58.181
{\an1}You guys get paid
out of the gate sales.

56:58.214 --> 56:59.982
No gate, no paycheck.

57:00.015 --> 57:01.918
{\an1}Come on, Stoney,
you know how this works.

57:01.951 --> 57:03.686
{\an1}Now unless someone else
wants to do it,

57:03.719 --> 57:07.890
I need to bring water to Dutch,
one of the other competitors.

Where's my four grand?

57:18.067 --> 57:19.702
I want it instamatically.

57:19.735 --> 57:21.704
{\an1}Butch, we're just talking
about your money.

57:21.737 --> 57:23.539
Brother owes money
to the dwarven mafia?

57:23.572 --> 57:24.573
That would seem to be the case.

57:24.607 --> 57:27.176
{\an1}You had me come to Santa Fe,
to this shithole?

57:27.209 --> 57:28.678
Well, here I am, funny guy.

57:28.711 --> 57:29.812
Now where's my money?

57:29.845 --> 57:31.614
{\an1}-Am I missing something?
-No, Skull!

57:31.647 --> 57:34.750
{\an1}I'm missing something,
four grand, plus the juice

57:34.783 --> 57:38.521
that your deadbeat brother
owes me now for two months,

57:38.554 --> 57:39.989
and I want it now.

57:40.022 --> 57:41.991
{\an1}Hey, man, hey,
let's just keep it calm, okay?

57:42.024 --> 57:43.226
Let's calm down a little bit.

57:43.259 --> 57:44.494
Yeah, just pop Stone.

57:44.527 --> 57:45.695
Don't hit no innocent bystander.

You're not helping, Carlos.

57:47.830 --> 57:50.132

57:50.165 --> 57:53.269
{\an1}Now, listen, Julius--
I'm sorry, Butch,

57:53.302 --> 57:55.505
{\an1}come on, man, I told ya
I was gonna get your money.

57:55.538 --> 57:56.706
You just got to help me out

57:56.739 --> 57:57.907
{\an1}and stop being
such a stiff prick

57:57.940 --> 57:59.775
{\an1}with all this Irish mob
bullshit, okay?

57:59.808 --> 58:01.677
I'm sorry, Stoney.

58:01.710 --> 58:05.214
{\an1}It's these guys,
these guys that I'm working for.

58:05.247 --> 58:08.217
{\an1}They treat me like
a little bitch all the time.

58:08.250 --> 58:10.019
{\an1}-And you want to know why?
-Why?

58:10.052 --> 58:11.053
'Cause you're a midget?

58:11.086 --> 58:13.022
What? No.

58:13.055 --> 58:15.758
I'm not a hundred percent Irish,

58:15.791 --> 58:17.627
you insensitive ass.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.962
My mom's Hungarian.

58:19.995 --> 58:21.597
{\an1}How am I supposed to know
the guy's ethics

58:21.630 --> 58:23.099
and nationgalities?

58:23.132 --> 58:25.234
Hey, I understand you, bro.

58:25.267 --> 58:26.936
{\an1}All you want
is a little respect.

58:26.969 --> 58:28.704
Is that too much to ask for?

58:28.737 --> 58:29.972
I think you're entitled.

58:30.005 --> 58:32.041
I'm a good person, Stone.

58:32.074 --> 58:33.709
{\an1}This just really hurts
my feelings.

58:33.742 --> 58:36.012
I know it does, come here.

58:36.045 --> 58:38.080
I love you, man.

58:38.113 --> 58:39.949
{\an1}Those guys just don't
understand you like we do.

58:39.982 --> 58:42.251
-Right, Skull?
-Apparently not.

58:42.284 --> 58:45.254
{\an1}Uh, Butch, since when does
my brother owe you four large?

58:45.287 --> 58:48.291
{\an1}I was gonna tell you
about that.

58:48.324 --> 58:51.060
{\an1}Numbnuts here, he takes a bet
down on the Bears

58:51.093 --> 58:54.597
two months ago and it dumps.

58:54.630 --> 58:56.065
He doubles down on the Jets.

58:56.098 --> 58:58.134
{\an1}I told him
not to lay the bet down,

58:58.167 --> 58:59.936
but if a guy wants
to lose his money

58:59.969 --> 59:02.605
{\an1}down the crapshoot,
who am I to get in the way?

59:02.638 --> 59:04.307
{\an1}I mean, I got to make a living
too, right, Skull?

59:04.340 --> 59:05.975
Yeah, what a maroon.

59:06.008 --> 59:08.144
Listen, uh, my brother
and I got to ejaculate

59:08.177 --> 59:09.312
about some stuff over here.

59:09.345 --> 59:10.980
{\an1}Why don't you go get us
some beer?

59:11.013 --> 59:13.783
Okay, uh...

59:13.816 --> 59:16.919
{\an1}Oh, shit, uh, do you mind
lending me 20 bucks?

59:16.952 --> 59:18.154
The arena is shut down.

59:18.187 --> 59:19.889
{\an1}Just go behind
the concession stand

59:19.922 --> 59:21.691
and pour it yourself,
and get me one too.

59:21.724 --> 59:23.192
-Bring you two?
-Also.

59:23.225 --> 59:25.861
-Bring you two also?
-Bring me one also.

59:25.894 --> 59:26.895
Then why'd you say two?

59:26.929 --> 59:28.598
{\an1}-Just get the fucking beer!
-Okay, all right!

59:28.631 --> 59:30.700
I'll get the fucking beer! Jeez!

I'm the one that owes you money.

of people, you know?

59:36.372 --> 59:38.007
Fear!

59:41.310 --> 59:42.678
Four grand, you fucko.

59:42.711 --> 59:44.714
No wonder you jumped
on that match so fast.

59:44.747 --> 59:46.215
When are you gonna tell me
about your debt to Butch,

59:46.248 --> 59:47.817
formerly Julius?

59:47.850 --> 59:49.719

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:14.930
Fellas, I hate to interrupt,

01:02:14.963 --> 01:02:17.533
{\an1}but can I get
a little help here?

01:02:17.566 --> 01:02:20.302
(grunting)

01:02:20.335 --> 01:02:21.337
You okay?

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:23.740
Oh, yeah. Never better.

01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:27.209
(thunder rumbling)

01:02:27.242 --> 01:02:29.779
{\an1}I guess I don't have to sweat
that four grand anymore.

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.013
Lucky son of a bitch.

01:02:31.046 --> 01:02:32.815
{\an1}Okay, okay,
so what do we do now?

01:02:32.848 --> 01:02:34.550
{\an1}Let's drag the bodies
in the dressing room with Vic.

01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:36.152
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.155
-Do we just...
-Yeah.

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:41.224
Okay, okay.

01:02:50.065 --> 01:02:52.067
Oh, fuck.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.369
Just killed him.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:58.974
{\an9}♪

01:02:59.007 --> 01:03:02.444
I'm telling ya, it's this
black market Chinese shit.

01:03:02.477 --> 01:03:04.380
Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:05.981
Oh, it's okay, baby, I got you.

01:03:06.014 --> 01:03:08.217
{\an1}It's fine. Oh, okay, or that,
that's fine.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:09.418
What did you do?

01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:11.020
{\an1}You guys, you have to come
to the cage.

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:12.354
There's something wrong
with your friend, Hammer.

01:03:12.387 --> 01:03:13.889
Mina went to take
a picture with him,

01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:14.924
{\an1}and then the next thing
we know,

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.592
he just collapsed
on top of her.

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:18.561
-Is she okay?
-She's okay.

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:19.929
She's with the fight doctor.

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:22.064
{\an1}-Dr. Dudembrü?
-He's out of rehab?

01:03:22.097 --> 01:03:24.133
{\an1}Hey, Hammer just dropped out
right--

01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:28.003
Oh, what the fuck is this?

01:03:28.036 --> 01:03:30.039
{\an1}-Are they dead?
-Oh, yeah, they're dead.

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:32.241
{\an1}-Holy shit, they're all dead!
-I just said that.

01:03:32.274 --> 01:03:34.310
{\an1}-What the hell happened?
-Dutch went crazy

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:35.477
and killed Vic and Butch.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:37.279
{\an1}-Who killed Dutch?
-Skull.

01:03:37.312 --> 01:03:39.048
{\an1}-Skull?
-What are you, a parrot?

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:41.483
Guys, please, come to the cage!

01:03:41.516 --> 01:03:43.352
{\an1}Thump, don't let anybody
near the dead bodies.

01:03:43.385 --> 01:03:45.454
If you get a cell signal,
call the police or fire.

01:03:45.487 --> 01:03:46.922
{\an1}-Got it.
-What should I do?

01:03:46.955 --> 01:03:49.024
{\an1}Do what you do best,
bitch and moan!

01:03:49.057 --> 01:03:51.126
Hey!

01:03:51.159 --> 01:03:52.928
Okay, I can do that.

01:03:52.961 --> 01:03:55.331
(cheering)

01:03:55.364 --> 01:04:00.236
{\an9}♪

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:01.137
Mins, are you okay?

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.138
{\an1}Yeah, babe. I'm little,
but I'm tough.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.306
{\an1}-That's my girl.
-What happened to Hammer?

01:04:04.339 --> 01:04:06.008
He just dropped like a rock.

01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:07.209
{\an1}This ear looks really infected,
though.

01:04:07.242 --> 01:04:09.545
Oh, yeah, they reinstitate
your license, huh, professor?

01:04:09.578 --> 01:04:12.147
{\an1}Twenty-eight days clean
to get my rig back.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.583
Nightmare.

01:04:14.616 --> 01:04:16.886
{\an1}I'd like to schedule you
for a full rectal.

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.321
She's up to date, Dudembrü.

01:04:19.354 --> 01:04:21.290
She's hot.

01:04:21.323 --> 01:04:23.592
{\an1}Can I help? I almost graduated
podiatry school.

01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:25.060
{\an1}What are you gonna do,
check for bunions?

01:04:25.093 --> 01:04:26.595
The guy was like 20 feet tall.

01:04:26.628 --> 01:04:28.497
Hey, you don't have to be
a driveling prick about it.

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:30.966
I was just trying to help.
I got feelings too, you know?

01:04:30.999 --> 01:04:31.967
{\an1}We're just fucking
with you, Bob.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.135
Yeah, Bob, I'm sorry.
Can you go take care

01:04:33.168 --> 01:04:35.204
{\an1}of the fans or something,
do your Radiant Bobby thing?

01:04:35.237 --> 01:04:37.306
I'll radiate 'em all right.

01:04:37.339 --> 01:04:38.941
Man, is that guy in shape.

01:04:38.974 --> 01:04:40.910
{\an1}-His six-pack has a six-pack.
-I know, right?

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.344
Hammer say anything
before he crashed?

01:04:42.377 --> 01:04:44.546
{\an1}Just started mumbling
about being thirsty or something

01:04:44.579 --> 01:04:47.216
{\an1}like he was in a trance,
and then he fell on top of me

01:04:47.249 --> 01:04:49.218
{\an1}and I was counting lights
on the ceiling.

01:04:49.251 --> 01:04:50.619
Dutch was sick like that.

01:04:50.652 --> 01:04:52.488
-Dutch is sick?
-Dutch is dead.

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.689
What? How?

01:04:53.722 --> 01:04:55.057
Skull killed him.

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:56.425
Why would you kill Dutch?

01:04:56.458 --> 01:04:58.060
Doc, he, like, went all apeshit.

01:04:58.093 --> 01:04:59.528
{\an1}He killed Vic
and this other friend of ours.

01:04:59.561 --> 01:05:00.395
He was out of control.

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:03.332
{\an1}-It was like he was all rabbit.
-Rabid.

01:05:03.365 --> 01:05:04.166
I don't know, guys.

01:05:04.199 --> 01:05:06.201
{\an1}This ear looks bad.
What happened?

01:05:06.234 --> 01:05:07.970
{\an1}He said he was grab-assing
in the locker room

01:05:08.003 --> 01:05:09.471
earlier with Dutch
and Dutch bit him,

01:05:09.504 --> 01:05:12.241
{\an1}but the ear didn't look
like that before.

01:05:12.274 --> 01:05:14.543
No, no.

01:05:14.576 --> 01:05:16.145
I don't like this at all.

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:18.514
(deep inhale)

01:05:20.515 --> 01:05:21.350

Oh, thank God.

Thank God.

01:12:54.736 --> 01:12:56.138
As you were!

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:57.672
Is everyone all right?

01:12:57.705 --> 01:13:01.009
-Oh, God, I'm hurt!
-Sweetheart, no!

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:02.043
I'm hurt.

01:13:02.076 --> 01:13:02.978
-Doc!
-Yeah?

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:04.079
Is he gonna be okay?

(grunting)

01:13:08.983 --> 01:13:10.986
I'm sorry, son, this is it.

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:12.687
He's not gonna make it.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.589
No!

01:13:14.622 --> 01:13:16.858
Stone, I'm so sorry, man,
it was an accident, bro.

01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:18.593
I swear to God.

01:13:18.626 --> 01:13:20.896

{\an9}♪

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:26.802
{\an1}I got to make a confession
before I pass, okay?

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:28.904
{\an1}Do you remember
on your 25th birthday,

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.472
I got you that hot Asian hooker,

01:13:30.505 --> 01:13:32.574
{\an1}the one that looked
like Tia Carrere, remember?

01:13:32.607 --> 01:13:33.642
{\an1}How could I forget, man?
She gave me

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:34.676
the best blowie of my life.

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:38.513
Yeah, well, it was a guy.

01:13:38.546 --> 01:13:39.948
Why?

01:13:39.981 --> 01:13:42.017
{\an1}I didn't have enough money
for bus fare,

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:46.087
{\an1}and the chick was extra money,
so I went with the dude!

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.590
{\an1}His name was Gordie Chang,
and during the day

01:13:48.623 --> 01:13:51.560
{\an1}he caught and sold pigeons
to Chinese restaurants

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.662
{\an1}for chicken almond ding,
but at night,

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:58.834
he turned tricks
for extra cash!

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.569
Jesus.

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:02.237
Everything is getting dark.

01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:04.706
Wait a minute,
stop the presses.

01:14:04.739 --> 01:14:08.844
{\an1}The bullet entered
the infected body here, right?

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:12.681
The exit wound is here.

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:13.815
You're gonna be all right.

01:14:13.848 --> 01:14:15.517
It missed you.

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:17.219
Skull! Ha-ha!

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:20.055
You're gonna live!

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:22.757
Oh, shit!

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:25.160

They got Thump.

01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:33.201
Sorry, Skull.

01:14:33.234 --> 01:14:35.537
Shit! Thump!

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:37.573
Ah, shit, man.

01:14:39.774 --> 01:14:41.243
A fucking dude?

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:43.044
{\an1}Look, it doesn't mean
you're gay.

01:14:43.077 --> 01:14:45.180
{\an1}-Stop, of course it doesn't.
-I'm just saying

01:14:45.213 --> 01:14:47.148
{\an1}because it's a little bit
of a gray area.

01:14:47.181 --> 01:14:50.051
{\an1}Haven't you said
enough already, Skull?

01:14:50.084 --> 01:14:51.753
{\an1}It's got to be
this Chinese shit.

01:14:51.786 --> 01:14:53.922
{\an1}-Chinese shit?
-Yeah, Dutch was taking

01:14:53.955 --> 01:14:55.891
{\an1}this Chinese black market
growth hormone.

01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:57.826
{\an1}Then everything
went up for grabs.

01:14:57.859 --> 01:15:00.829
{\an1}Well, Dutch got infected
with that hormone

01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:02.797
and there was something in it.

01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:04.866
{\an1}And if the incubation process
is going from infection

01:15:04.899 --> 01:15:06.568
{\an1}to full-blown disease
that quickly,

01:15:06.601 --> 01:15:09.204
we are in serious,
serious trouble.

01:15:09.237 --> 01:15:12.274
{\an1}See, we wouldn't know
who was infected.

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:14.042
It could be anybody.

01:15:15.343 --> 01:15:17.212
Who was touching who?

01:15:17.245 --> 01:15:20.682
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:15:20.715 --> 01:15:22.117
{\an1}That girl scratched me
a little bit

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:23.552
when she was attacking me,

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:26.187
but it's not bleeding
or anything, so...

01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.790

What the fuck?

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:37.832
Carson!

01:15:37.865 --> 01:15:39.634
Why did you do that, Carson?

01:15:39.667 --> 01:15:41.169
{\an1}You fucking murdered her,
you piece of shit!

01:15:41.202 --> 01:15:43.305
{\an1}No, she was infected
just like all these guys.

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.574
-It was a scratch!
-She would've turned.

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:46.441
You don't know that!

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:49.044
{\an1}This magic mask
better fucking work.

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:50.879
Hey, take it easy, brother.

01:15:50.912 --> 01:15:52.247
{\an1}She was infected
and she would've turned

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.148
just like them.

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:55.216
Hey, Skull.

01:15:55.249 --> 01:15:57.118
Don't make me shoot you.

01:15:57.151 --> 01:15:59.721

{\an1}Good, eat that phony
sack of shit!

Me and you ain't done!

01:16:17.171 --> 01:16:18.607
-Doc, you okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

Shit! Eddie!

01:16:24.779 --> 01:16:26.681
Eddie...

01:16:26.714 --> 01:16:29.651
Screwed again.

01:16:29.684 --> 01:16:31.119
{\an1}Guys, we got to keep
our heads on.

01:16:31.152 --> 01:16:33.388
{\an1}Stone, if this virus
really does spread that fast

01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:34.889
{\an1}and it gets outside
the building,

01:16:34.922 --> 01:16:36.858
{\an1}it's gonna be
an all-out pandemic.

01:16:36.891 --> 01:16:39.260
{\an1}If the storm keeps up,
nothing is getting in or out.

01:16:39.293 --> 01:16:41.863

01:16:44.265 --> 01:16:45.967

{\an1}No. It means they're stuck
in here with us.

01:16:49.103 --> 01:16:52.841
{\an1}We're gonna kill
every single fucking one of 'em.

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.275
Please hold.

{\an1}We can't get out in this shit,
but they might be able to.

01:17:03.451 --> 01:17:04.719
{\an1}The only open doors
were this one

01:17:04.752 --> 01:17:06.221
and the main entrance.

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:09.157
That's on the other end
of the marina--arena

01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:10.225
which is that way.

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:11.960
Yeah.

01:17:11.993 --> 01:17:13.728

This ain't gonna
hold 'em forever.

{\an1}Sooner or later,
they're gonna figure out

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:19.394
they can climb over the top.

-Moon!

{\an1}-Let's get this over with.
-Get what over with?

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.502
{\an1}Dammit, Moon.
We thought you were infected.

01:18:27.535 --> 01:18:30.438
{\an1}I am infected with
about a fifth of good bourbon.

01:18:30.471 --> 01:18:32.807
{\an1}I hid under the ring
when the shit hit the fan.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.309
See how I did that?
The shit hit the fan.

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:35.310
Yeah, it's very clever.

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:36.978
If you guys got any idea
how to get out of here,

01:18:37.011 --> 01:18:38.146
I'm willing to listen to it.

01:18:38.179 --> 01:18:40.081
{\an1}-We're gonna let 'em in.
-What?

01:18:40.114 --> 01:18:41.116
Let 'em in?

01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:42.217
Are you out of your gourd?

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.518
No, listen.

01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:45.153
The doc and Moon
hide on the floor

01:18:45.186 --> 01:18:46.955
{\an1}between the ring apron
and the cage.

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:48.423
Then, me and you
open up the gate

01:18:48.456 --> 01:18:50.191
{\an1}and they'll come flying in
right for us.

01:18:50.224 --> 01:18:52.127
{\an1}I'm failing to see
how that's a good idea.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.395
Me and Stone lure 'em
to the opposite corner.

01:18:54.428 --> 01:18:56.131
You and Moon slip out the door,

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:57.465
slam the gate shut,

01:18:57.498 --> 01:18:59.033
locking us in here with them!

01:18:59.066 --> 01:19:00.235
Locking them in with us?

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:02.103
Oh, how silly of me,
I failed to see it.

01:19:02.136 --> 01:19:04.973
{\an1}-What a perfect plan. Dumbass!
-Just listen!

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:07.075
{\an1}It's too tight for us
to get 'em all in here at once.

01:19:07.108 --> 01:19:09.144
{\an1}They'll swarm us,
so we'll go over the top.

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:11.179
By the time they figure out
they can come over the top,

01:19:11.212 --> 01:19:14.048
{\an1}we'll pick 'em off a cappella
as they come down, savvy?

01:19:14.081 --> 01:19:16.818
{\an1}-Skull, you're an idiot.
-That might work.

01:19:16.851 --> 01:19:18.520
{\an1}You think you guys
can handle all of them?

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:19.654
Can we handle 'em?

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:21.456
{\an1}-Can we handle 'em?
-We're the Manson Brothers.

01:19:21.489 --> 01:19:22.357
We can handle it.

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.893
{\an1}-You two take a powder.
-Good luck, boys.

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.561
{\an1}Shitty time for bourbon
to run dry.

01:19:26.594 --> 01:19:28.296
{\an1}Are you sure
this is gonna work?

01:19:28.329 --> 01:19:31.299
{\an1}Doc, you got some nitrous
or anything?

01:19:31.332 --> 01:19:34.336
{\an1}-No.
-You selfish bastard.

01:19:36.971 --> 01:19:38.807
Oh, Lord.

01:19:41.108 --> 01:19:42.977
{\an1}-Put the mask on.
-Yeah, right.

01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:44.412
{\an9}♪

01:19:44.445 --> 01:19:47.115
Let's get ready.

01:19:47.148 --> 01:19:48.283
Ready?

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:49.818
-Yeah.
-Pull it.

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:53.087

01:20:11.105 --> 01:20:12.841
Fuck.

01:20:12.874 --> 01:20:14.042
Well, that was weird.

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:15.143
It's the masks.

01:20:15.176 --> 01:20:16.311
A spooky magic.

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:18.313
A spooky magic!

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:19.547
Oh, boy.

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:20.849
A spooky magic.

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:23.484

Come on, come on, come on!

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:44.372
Hurry up.

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.616
Suerte magia.

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:56.618
{\an1}That's exactly
what the gypsy said.

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:58.620
Uh-oh.

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:01.189
(growling, roaring)

01:21:03.424 --> 01:21:04.459
He's even hot as a zombie.

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.194
Oh, this ain't good.

01:21:06.227 --> 01:21:09.197

01:21:09.230 --> 01:21:11.933
Fundamentals, fundamentals!

01:21:11.966 --> 01:21:14.068
Fundamentals,
fundamentals.

01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:15.603
{\an9}♪

01:21:15.636 --> 01:21:17.238
Good.

01:21:17.271 --> 01:21:20.108
{\an1}-Skull, help!
-Okay, you've got this.

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:21.276
Yeah, he's yours.

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:22.143
Hey, dickhole,

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:23.611
not the best time
to prove a point!

01:21:23.644 --> 01:21:24.646
Good.

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:26.314
Okay, atomic wedgie.

01:21:26.347 --> 01:21:29.617
Atomic wedgie, atomic wedgie.

01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:32.220
(grunting)

01:21:32.253 --> 01:21:33.655
Okay, good.

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:35.223
Now, pressure, pressure.

01:21:35.256 --> 01:21:36.991
Grab your jacket.

01:21:37.024 --> 01:21:39.527
{\an1}Grab your jacket like this,
put him to sleep.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.162
Good, just like that.

01:21:41.195 --> 01:21:42.263
Pressure.

01:21:42.296 --> 01:21:44.365
Pressure. Good.

01:21:44.398 --> 01:21:47.335
Nice. Nice.

01:21:47.368 --> 01:21:51.239
See? Now was that hard?

01:21:51.272 --> 01:21:52.307
You're effective.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:55.543
You're sloppy as shit,
but you're effective.

01:21:55.576 --> 01:21:56.611
Could've got bit.

01:21:56.644 --> 01:21:58.112
Giving me the old

01:21:58.145 --> 01:22:00.081
{\an1}win one for the gipper speech,
Knute Rockne.

01:22:00.114 --> 01:22:02.150
{\an1}Oh, I love the one
where Rockne fights Mr. T.

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:06.721
Little pitchy, boys.

01:22:06.754 --> 01:22:08.489
Listen, I'm gonna go get
my phone out of my bag.

01:22:08.522 --> 01:22:09.624
Maybe we could reach somebody.

01:22:09.657 --> 01:22:11.726
{\an1}-Hold on a minute.
-What?

01:22:11.759 --> 01:22:13.461
It's my semimembranosus.

01:22:13.494 --> 01:22:15.096
Know what you should do?

01:22:15.129 --> 01:22:16.431
Put a little Vagisil on it.

01:22:16.464 --> 01:22:19.033
It's not a crotch itch,
it's a muscle strain.

01:22:19.066 --> 01:22:20.568
It's your vagina.

01:22:20.601 --> 01:22:22.704
{\an1}You stay here with
the Santa Fe zombie boys choir.

01:22:22.737 --> 01:22:23.705
I'll be right back.

01:22:23.738 --> 01:22:25.239
Yeah, right.

01:22:25.272 --> 01:22:27.309
(snarling)

01:22:28.609 --> 01:22:31.179

01:22:42.289 --> 01:22:44.659

01:22:44.692 --> 01:22:51.499
{\an9}♪

01:22:51.532 --> 01:22:54.702
{\an1}Jesus H. Christmas,
something ain't right in there.

{\an9}♪

01:22:57.371 --> 01:22:59.040
Oh!

01:22:59.073 --> 01:23:00.641
{\an9}♪

01:23:00.674 --> 01:23:03.411
{\an1}I guess it's hard to call in
when you're dead.

01:23:03.444 --> 01:23:06.214
Sorry, Jack. Wanger.

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:10.418

01:23:20.394 --> 01:23:30.338

01:23:32.206 --> 01:23:33.608
{\an1}Wow. Well, it looks
like we might

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:36.444
{\an1}actually make it out of here
tonight after all.

01:23:36.477 --> 01:23:38.413
{\an1}-Figured you for dead.
-Me?

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:40.581
No. No, no, no.

01:23:40.614 --> 01:23:43.051
{\an1}Nah, see, I just found me
a nice little place

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:45.086
to bunker down, waited it out.

01:23:45.119 --> 01:23:46.521
Oh, thank God.

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:47.655
{\an1}I mean, you wouldn't want to,
I don't know,

01:23:47.688 --> 01:23:49.424
help or anything, right?

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:51.192
{\an1}I always knew you were
a phony little weasel anyway,

01:23:51.225 --> 01:23:53.394
though, so...

01:23:53.427 --> 01:23:55.663
It's just the two of us now.

01:23:55.696 --> 01:23:58.232
You know what, Stone?

01:23:58.265 --> 01:24:00.234
I never liked you, man.

01:24:00.267 --> 01:24:01.302
No.

01:24:01.335 --> 01:24:03.638
No, so you've spent so long

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:05.440
{\an1}trying to undermine
my reputation

01:24:05.473 --> 01:24:06.741
as a legit hooker.

01:24:06.774 --> 01:24:08.543
'Cause you're not
a legit hooker.

01:24:08.576 --> 01:24:10.278
{\an1}Your entire career
has been built on a lie

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:11.746
{\an1}that you've told yourself
so many times,

01:24:11.779 --> 01:24:13.381
you actually believe it.

01:24:13.414 --> 01:24:14.782
{\an1}And it may not have bothered
my brother,

01:24:14.815 --> 01:24:16.317
{\an1}but it sure as shit
bothered me

01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:18.219
{\an1}listening to you blow yourself
all these years

01:24:18.252 --> 01:24:21.155
{\an1}with that living legend
crock of shit.

01:24:21.188 --> 01:24:24.592
Well, I am the living legend,

01:24:24.625 --> 01:24:26.661
and I'm about to be
even more of a legend

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.596
{\an1}when the whole public,
when they hear

01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:32.200
{\an1}about how I single-handedly
thwarted the greatest pandemic

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:33.201
since the bubonic plague.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:36.271
Would you shut the fuck up?

01:24:37.538 --> 01:24:40.675
Fuck! Ahh!

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:43.744
Anyway, like I was saying,

01:24:43.777 --> 01:24:46.714
{\an1}now all I have to do
is just kill all of those guys

01:24:46.747 --> 01:24:49.350
and then kill you,

01:24:49.383 --> 01:24:52.687
{\an1}and then nobody will be
the wiser.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.489
Carson, I must admit,
I was pretty happy

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:56.290
{\an1}when I thought
you were dead, buddy.

01:24:56.323 --> 01:24:57.892
{\an1}But I gotta tell ya,
I'm ecstatic

01:24:57.925 --> 01:24:58.893
to find out you're alive.

01:24:58.926 --> 01:25:00.528
Aw.

01:25:00.561 --> 01:25:02.597
Thank you. Why is that?

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.198
Well, seeing you find out

01:25:04.231 --> 01:25:06.300
what I've known
all these years,

01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:07.535
it is gonna be a gas.

01:25:07.568 --> 01:25:09.504
{\an1}Don't keep me guessing.
What is it?

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:12.440
{\an1}That on your best day
you couldn't beat my brother

01:25:12.473 --> 01:25:14.375
{\an1}if he was drunk
and wearing roller skates.

01:25:14.408 --> 01:25:16.511
Oh, please, Stone.

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:19.147
Okay, you and I both know
that I would've ripped

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.682
{\an1}your weak-ass brother apart
in five seconds flat.

01:25:21.715 --> 01:25:23.184
{\an1}-Five seconds, huh?
-Yup.

01:25:23.217 --> 01:25:25.820
I'll take that action.

01:25:25.853 --> 01:25:28.389
{\an1}Hey! Skull.
What's going on, buddy?

01:25:28.422 --> 01:25:30.391
{\an1}I thought you were dead, man,
I didn't know you--

01:25:30.424 --> 01:25:31.826
You didn't tell me
he was still alive.

01:25:31.859 --> 01:25:32.760
{\an1}Hey, bro, you're not
gonna need that.

01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:33.928
Toss it over here.

01:25:33.961 --> 01:25:36.297
Hey, Skull, take it easy, man.

01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:38.332
I understand you are
super pissed right now,

01:25:38.365 --> 01:25:40.835
I get it, and we're gonna
get through it, okay, man?

01:25:40.868 --> 01:25:43.704
{\an1}I mean, it's gonna be fi--
oh, come on, Skull.

01:25:43.737 --> 01:25:45.339
You don't want to do that.

01:25:45.372 --> 01:25:46.507
You don't want to get
embarrassed again.

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:49.744
{\an1}I mean, do you really want
to trade blows with the master?

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.412
Do you really want to take on

01:25:51.445 --> 01:25:53.581
{\an1}the fucking
people's champion, huh?

{\an1}You always were
Thump's little bitch.

01:26:28.515 --> 01:26:30.885

{\an1}You know, of all the people
who got killed today,

01:26:50.904 --> 01:26:52.340
I'm glad he's dead the most.

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:53.507
{\an1}You know, his problem
always was

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:54.308
he just never understood

of the art.
