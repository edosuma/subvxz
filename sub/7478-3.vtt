00:20.803 --> 00:22.653
Stingray 6, this is Hawkeye.

00:22.677 --> 00:27.094
Live fire exercise green to go.
Requesting permission to fire.

00:27.310 --> 00:28.424
Permission to fire granted.

00:30.396 --> 00:32.329
That's a roger, Stingray 6.

00:32.353 --> 00:34.373
- BFT has you cleared.
- Target is confirmed.

00:34.397 --> 00:36.785
You have authorisation to fire.
Hauling back.

00:36.809 --> 00:43.653
Hawkeye is fired
in five, four, three, two, one.

00:47.163 --> 00:51.741
Hawkeye, this is Stingray 6.
Confirm missile fired. Over.

00:53.252 --> 00:55.137
- Stand by.
- Hawkeye,

00:55.161 --> 00:57.460
we are getting a misfire alert.

01:00.259 --> 01:04.399
Your drone is veering
off course. Return to previous vector.

01:04.423 --> 01:06.067
What the hell's happening?

01:06.091 --> 01:07.783
Target coordinates are shifting.

01:07.807 --> 01:10.680
Mike, get out of there,
I've now lost control of the drone.

01:13.189 --> 01:16.450
We have radar
confirmation of missile fire. Advise.

01:16.474 --> 01:19.355
Mike, the missile's live.
Get out of there.

01:20.571 --> 01:21.686
Mike.

02:00.820 --> 02:01.827
So?

02:01.851 --> 02:04.236
- So?
- I wanna know.

02:04.740 --> 02:07.445
You want to gossip at my expense.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.673
Come on. How did it go last night?
Date number two.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.342
It didn't. Cancelled.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.841
- He cancelled?
- I cancelled.

02:14.865 --> 02:17.165
It wouldn't have ended well.
It's pretty much over.

02:17.503 --> 02:19.081
I thought the first date went great.

02:19.839 --> 02:22.484
Look, you guys,
I am the best first-date girl in town.

02:22.508 --> 02:26.316
I mean, I bring my A-game.
Funny, flirty, charming,

02:26.340 --> 02:29.181
- spontaneous, tasteful.
- Like me.

02:30.099 --> 02:31.735
- And the second?
- Second date.

02:31.759 --> 02:35.611
Antsy, bored, distant,
impatient, irritable.

02:35.635 --> 02:36.820
Like G.

02:36.844 --> 02:38.541
I decided to save everybody trouble.

02:38.565 --> 02:41.875
End it early
and embrace my skill set.

02:41.899 --> 02:44.002
- The first date's the last date.
- Absolutely.

02:44.026 --> 02:50.839
Few men know how to deal with
a smart, strong, independent woman.

02:50.863 --> 02:54.216
They say they want a soul mate
to share their dreams

02:54.240 --> 02:55.505
and their hopes with,

02:55.529 --> 02:58.305
but all they really want
is a substitute mommy.

02:58.329 --> 03:00.804
As a professional psychologist,
I have to completely...

03:00.828 --> 03:03.792
- Nate, sit down.
- Okay, well, I'm gonna sit.

03:05.342 --> 03:08.818
- Mission briefing?
- Sexual-harassment guidelines.

03:08.842 --> 03:13.141
There's a seminar next week
and it is mandatory.

03:13.601 --> 03:15.843
Even for you, Mr. Callen.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.248
George Hamilton once told me

03:19.272 --> 03:23.390
that what men really love
is a woman who plays hard to get.

03:27.364 --> 03:29.606
Or was it Sinatra?

03:36.373 --> 03:38.366
- Saved by the whistle.
- Yeah.

03:38.959 --> 03:42.020
All right, footage from Camp
Pendleton, tagged, "classified."

03:42.044 --> 03:44.098
- How old is this?
- Approximately 24 hours.

03:44.122 --> 03:45.899
What are we looking at, exactly?

03:45.923 --> 03:49.353
The battlefield through the eyes
of an unmanned aerial vehicle,

03:49.377 --> 03:51.760
commonly referred to as a UAV.

03:52.223 --> 03:53.574
The future of warfare.

03:53.598 --> 03:55.818
Field operatives in Pakistan
call in a target

03:55.842 --> 03:58.474
to a pilot sitting behind a joystick
in California.

03:58.813 --> 04:01.624
The pilot hits a button,
it rains missiles down on the bad guys.

04:01.648 --> 04:03.286
Like a video game, but real.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.165
This feed is from a live-fire
training exercise at Pendleton.

04:06.189 --> 04:08.414
A Marine unit was working in tandem
with the drone.

04:08.438 --> 04:10.547
This one happened to be armed
with two missiles.

04:10.571 --> 04:13.635
- Who changed target coordinates?
- Still trying to figure that out.

04:13.659 --> 04:15.904
Here's the feed
from the missile's warhead camera.

04:16.163 --> 04:17.194
The Marine was killed.

04:21.209 --> 04:22.704
Run it back. There.

04:23.254 --> 04:24.582
Sergeant Michael Hazlett.

04:25.339 --> 04:27.747
Specialised in coordinating UAVs
with the ground teams.

04:28.092 --> 04:30.559
- Married. Three kids.
- Who was flying the drone?

04:30.583 --> 04:34.889
Air Force Captain Mark Holden Briggs.
Says he didn't misfire.

04:35.432 --> 04:37.567
Drone fired itself?

04:37.591 --> 04:39.642
I think we need to take a look
at that drone.

04:40.312 --> 04:42.661
Good luck with that.
It disappeared from radar.

04:42.685 --> 04:45.098
- Crashed?
- They can't find it.

04:46.819 --> 04:49.416
- What killed Sergeant Hazlett?
- Theory one: Pilot error.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.041
- System malfunction.
- Sabotage.

04:53.065 --> 04:55.709
It was a joint op between
the Marine Corps and the Air Force.

04:55.733 --> 04:59.470
So security clearance
could narrow those choices.

04:59.494 --> 05:02.214
Air Force doesn't want us
going through their dirty laundry.

05:02.238 --> 05:05.063
Logging that request means 50 pages
of print and a day's wait.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.803
We're sitting on our hands
while the trail runs cold.

05:07.827 --> 05:09.382
Bureaucracy.

05:13.345 --> 05:14.780
It's all about who you know.

05:14.804 --> 05:16.763
We know anyone?

05:19.894 --> 05:21.851
We know people.

05:22.771 --> 05:24.681
The kind of people
who know people.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.155
- Hetty and Frank Sinatra.
- Don't go there.

05:32.990 --> 05:34.923
He told her men like women
who play hard to get.

05:34.947 --> 05:36.587
- Sam.
- Which suggests

05:36.611 --> 05:39.359
that Hetty was playing hard to get
with Frank Sinatra.

05:39.747 --> 05:41.134
I told you not to go there.

05:41.158 --> 05:42.885
Yeah, you did.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.041
Old blue eyes and Hetty.

05:48.130 --> 05:51.001
- I guess Hetty did it her way.
- Here he comes.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.651
What agency is this guy with?

05:53.675 --> 05:56.192
CIA, NSA, DOD.

05:56.216 --> 05:58.653
Some say he's a black-ops handler
for all three.

05:58.677 --> 06:00.200
But he's our guy.

06:00.224 --> 06:03.062
He's not our guy. He's Hetty's guy.

06:04.271 --> 06:07.557
Gentlemen,
this conversation never happened.

06:08.192 --> 06:09.686
You have 60 seconds.

06:11.362 --> 06:13.081
How secure are these UAVs?

06:13.105 --> 06:16.423
Hackers are testing U.S.A.F.
Security protocols constantly.

06:16.447 --> 06:17.624
Over the past month,

06:17.648 --> 06:20.554
we had four experimental UAVs
breached domestically.

06:20.578 --> 06:22.002
Has this happened before?

06:22.026 --> 06:24.911
Every other time it happened,
drones crashed within ten seconds.

06:25.209 --> 06:26.299
Practise runs.

06:26.323 --> 06:29.372
Hackers are trying to see
if they can get the hang of it.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.084
Your time is up.

06:33.676 --> 06:36.345
Tell Hetty I haven't forgotten
about Nepal,

06:36.804 --> 06:40.255
but as far as I'm concerned,
we're even now.

06:43.435 --> 06:45.724
It didn't seem like 60 seconds to me.

06:46.313 --> 06:47.914
Bad cologne.

06:47.938 --> 06:51.665
A copy of the UAV's video feed just
popped up on sphereguide. Com.

06:51.689 --> 06:54.458
- Which is?
- Like YouTube for hackers.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.125
Can you trace the IP address?

06:56.149 --> 06:58.790
The poster's signal was bounced off
six different servers.

06:58.814 --> 07:01.566
He doesn't wanna be found,
but I'll get him.

07:03.831 --> 07:04.838
Rewind it.

07:04.862 --> 07:06.724
This is the feed
from the drone's camera.

07:06.748 --> 07:08.886
Looks like it landed
in the desert somewhere.

07:08.910 --> 07:12.502
Based on its last coordinates,
it's gotta be local.

07:13.257 --> 07:14.810
So there was no crash.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.562
How many missiles
were on the drone?

07:16.586 --> 07:18.670
Two. It fired one.

07:20.264 --> 07:22.138
And here comes our man.

07:23.058 --> 07:26.392
- What are you up to?
- He powered it down.

07:28.063 --> 07:30.685
He must have loaded
the drone in the back of the truck.

07:38.532 --> 07:40.216
Who is this guy?

07:40.240 --> 07:43.196
Proud new owner
of a Hellfire missile.

07:43.662 --> 07:45.240
And he's somewhere in L.A.

07:58.901 --> 08:00.371
I started a facial-recognition search

08:00.395 --> 08:02.621
- on the driver.
- There's no plates on the truck.

08:02.645 --> 08:05.039
- How are we gonna trace them?
- Kaleidoscope.

08:05.063 --> 08:07.862
The R & D guys over at China Lake
developed the algorithm.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.678
What is it?

08:09.702 --> 08:12.633
It's the Naval Weapons Centre's
brand new visual-query system.

08:12.657 --> 08:14.847
Feed it the description of a person,
place or thing,

08:14.871 --> 08:18.767
it scans live feeds
from traffic cams, ATM cams,

08:18.791 --> 08:20.563
and satellite images for a result.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.603
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- I kid you not.

08:23.627 --> 08:25.057
All right, search terms:

08:25.081 --> 08:27.194
Blue 18-wheel semi,

08:27.218 --> 08:32.179
and Middle Eastern man
in his 20's behind the wheel.

08:32.393 --> 08:33.827
What if he isn't mobile anymore?

08:33.851 --> 08:36.533
Then we wait. He'll have to
move the drone eventually.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.616
What's to stop him
from flying out of country?

08:38.640 --> 08:42.125
The UAV's transponder.
It automatically activates on takeoff.

08:42.149 --> 08:44.941
Once it's online, we can track it,
so he's not gonna risk it.

08:45.239 --> 08:49.071
My guess is if we see it airborne again,
it'll probably be in targeting mode.

08:49.868 --> 08:51.920
Every government and terrorist
in the Middle East

08:51.944 --> 08:53.425
wants a piece of that technology.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.200
He'll have no problem
finding a buyer.

08:55.916 --> 08:57.956
Eric, alert Homeland Security.

08:59.086 --> 09:01.434
We can't let this guy
get it out of the country.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.587
How fast can we get that footage
off the web?

09:03.924 --> 09:07.258
With or without the cooperation of
sphereguide. Com's legal department?

09:09.513 --> 09:11.719
Okay, cutting through legal tape.

09:14.727 --> 09:17.134
I just crashed their entire server.

09:17.438 --> 09:19.477
Idiot hackers!

09:21.650 --> 09:23.643
Sam, I think we're due
in the boathouse.

09:24.903 --> 09:26.398
Walking.

09:28.073 --> 09:30.113
- Eric did it.
- Hey, Hetty.

09:31.493 --> 09:35.419
I was watching that viral video
with the cats and the trampoline.

09:35.443 --> 09:38.540
And the site just froze up
and crashed on me.

09:39.001 --> 09:42.286
Did you have anything to do
with that?

09:49.178 --> 09:51.941
Gentlemen, a tale of the tape.

09:51.965 --> 09:55.033
Captain Mark Holden Briggs,
32 years old,

09:55.057 --> 09:57.775
earned valedictorian honours
from the Air Force Academy

09:57.799 --> 10:01.039
and graduated the top 1 percent of
his class at U.S.A.F. Weapons School.

10:01.063 --> 10:02.488
Smart guy.

10:02.512 --> 10:04.826
Also has a narcissist-egocentric
disorder.

10:04.850 --> 10:08.454
Type of person who believes the world
revolves around him. If he's guilty,

10:08.478 --> 10:12.131
he'll have what he believes to be
perfectly good reasons for his actions.

10:12.155 --> 10:14.129
Joystick jockey with an attitude.

10:14.153 --> 10:16.735
Antagonising him is not a way
to break through him.

10:17.706 --> 10:19.663
Do I look like an antagonist, Nate?

10:30.928 --> 10:32.813
This is by no means
an admission of guilt,

10:32.837 --> 10:35.421
but I want my JAG lawyer present.

10:36.100 --> 10:39.350
Maybe he'll get here eventually,
but traffic's a bitch today.

10:44.441 --> 10:46.268
Mike Hazlett...

10:49.571 --> 10:51.860
Mike Hazlett was a good man.

10:52.449 --> 10:55.960
A friend.
I knew his wife and his kids.

10:55.984 --> 10:58.260
Friends don't always get along.

10:58.284 --> 10:59.736
Check the paperwork.

11:00.082 --> 11:03.427
We ran a full diagnostic.
There was no system failure.

11:03.451 --> 11:06.308
I did not misfire. It's all documented.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.536
Then what happened?

11:10.134 --> 11:12.233
A hacker got into the system.

11:12.257 --> 11:14.385
It's experimental.

11:15.180 --> 11:18.775
It's flawed and I knew it.
Mike knew it.

11:18.799 --> 11:20.150
Maybe you made a mistake.

11:20.174 --> 11:22.926
Maybe that mistake let a hacker
in the system.

11:23.272 --> 11:26.202
I don't programme them, I fly them.

11:26.226 --> 11:27.728
And I don't make mistakes.

11:29.653 --> 11:32.440
Maybe you got paid
to fly it somewhere off the grid.

11:34.533 --> 11:35.992
Paid?

11:36.869 --> 11:37.983
You think I sold out?

11:39.788 --> 11:43.216
I should be flying F-22s
over Afghanistan right now,

11:43.240 --> 11:44.768
but I'm stuck in Riverside,

11:44.792 --> 11:46.680
rotting away in a steel box

11:46.704 --> 11:50.129
next to joystick jockeys raised
on energy drinks and video games.

11:50.424 --> 11:52.666
What happened yesterday
was inevitable.

11:54.011 --> 11:55.778
Drones can get hacked.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.465
Fighter pilots can't.

12:00.726 --> 12:02.884
And now America's about to find
that out the hard way.

12:07.107 --> 12:08.992
Everything that came
out of Brigg's mouth

12:09.016 --> 12:10.711
could be considered motive.

12:10.735 --> 12:13.204
His body language
is indicating something else entirely.

12:13.228 --> 12:15.504
- Which is?
- Well, he's frustrated and angry,

12:15.528 --> 12:18.273
but Briggs is not our guy.

12:20.204 --> 12:22.280
- What do you got, Eric?
- A hit.

12:22.664 --> 12:25.844
- Kaleidoscope?
- No, that's still looking.

12:25.868 --> 12:27.430
We got a lead on our hacker.

12:27.454 --> 12:30.889
He posted the UAV attack footage
from the Rathmore Tech campus.

12:30.913 --> 12:34.269
More specifically, the science
auditorium at 10:23 a.m. Today.

12:34.293 --> 12:37.718
- You got a name?
- We've got 67 names.

12:38.013 --> 12:41.073
So many students were logged
onto the wireless hub at the time,

12:41.097 --> 12:44.446
all of them taking a daylong class
in advanced computer science.

12:44.470 --> 12:47.622
They are on lunch break now.
They reconvene in about 90 minutes.

12:47.646 --> 12:49.499
They're scheduled
to have a guest speaker.

12:49.523 --> 12:51.707
A reformed hacker
who now works for the FBI.

12:51.731 --> 12:53.100
What is the good news?

12:53.570 --> 12:56.037
Well, the only people
that can put an actual face

12:56.061 --> 12:57.983
to the hacker's name
work for the bureau.

12:58.826 --> 13:00.082
So we can improvise.

13:00.106 --> 13:03.547
Eric, find out who posted that video
of the drone landing.

13:03.571 --> 13:05.076
Ho, brah!

13:05.833 --> 13:08.952
- Excuse me?
- It's a surfer thing.

13:10.379 --> 13:11.469
It's a surfer thing?

13:11.493 --> 13:14.269
Yeah, as in a spontaneous expression
of ecstasy

13:14.293 --> 13:16.020
that could accompany
the perfect swell.

13:16.044 --> 13:17.736
The kind that just crests like that.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.980
- Eric? You can hang up now.
- Just riding in it.

13:20.004 --> 13:23.929
Yeah. No, wait. Facial recognition
just ID'd our semi driver.

13:24.393 --> 13:25.591
DMV database.

13:27.062 --> 13:28.319
Yousef Kaleem.

13:28.343 --> 13:31.725
No criminal record.
Home address in Venice, California.

13:36.947 --> 13:38.192
You went soft on him.

13:38.866 --> 13:39.980
Briggs.

13:40.784 --> 13:43.298
Man, I know you're not gonna go here
with me right now.

13:43.322 --> 13:46.472
We're in the middle of chasing
our only lead on our only suspect.

13:46.496 --> 13:49.559
You know your ears wiggle
when you try to avoid a conversation?

13:49.583 --> 13:50.783
It's kind of adorable.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.129
Okay.

13:59.511 --> 14:01.420
For years,
I dreamed of being a SEAL.

14:01.805 --> 14:03.632
I gave up everything else
to get there.

14:04.057 --> 14:05.492
Everything.

14:05.516 --> 14:06.823
If I saw the finish line

14:06.847 --> 14:09.949
and found out that the Navy
was gonna bump me somewhere else,

14:09.973 --> 14:11.641
I'd be angry too.

14:19.239 --> 14:21.481
And my ears don't wiggle.

14:25.746 --> 14:28.806
So, what are we this time?
A couple of salesmen who got lost?

14:28.830 --> 14:31.870
Maybe some guys looking
for an old college friend?

14:32.294 --> 14:35.686
How about we're two armed federal
agents trying to apprehend a terrorist?

14:35.710 --> 14:36.960
Oh, yeah.

14:41.804 --> 14:43.298
Do it.

14:50.479 --> 14:51.759
Clear.

14:52.439 --> 14:53.898
Clear.

15:05.452 --> 15:10.174
"And Allah will rain the fire of the just
down on Zion and America,

15:10.198 --> 15:14.074
the two Satans,
crushing the infidels."

15:14.378 --> 15:16.512
It just needs a little reggae beat.

15:16.536 --> 15:19.465
Islamic discussion boards 24/7.

15:52.499 --> 15:54.622
Get your hand out of the bag.

15:55.919 --> 15:57.330
This is not the way of Allah.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.335
- What do you know about Allah?
- Kaleem.

16:08.473 --> 16:11.225
You quote the Koran in Arabic,
but you still do the work of infidels.

16:11.435 --> 16:13.569
- We just wanna talk.
- Nobody wanted to talk to me.

16:13.593 --> 16:14.861
Well, we do, all right?

16:14.885 --> 16:17.436
- We wanna talk. I promise you.
- Put the satchel down.

16:19.359 --> 16:20.901
Run.

16:36.275 --> 16:37.282
What happened?

16:37.306 --> 16:38.741
- Kaleem's dead.
- How?

16:38.765 --> 16:39.951
- Shot.
- Blown up.

16:39.975 --> 16:41.540
You guys are thorough.

16:41.564 --> 16:43.707
Yeah, what are we doing now?

16:43.731 --> 16:46.125
We focus on the hacker
who posted the UAV footage.

16:46.149 --> 16:48.652
Is that blood, Mr. Hanna?

16:49.872 --> 16:51.390
- Mostly.
- Yours?

16:51.414 --> 16:53.373
Other guy's.

16:53.667 --> 16:56.419
- Can we bill him?
- Not anymore.

16:58.130 --> 17:00.431
You wouldn't happen to have
a pair of pants, would you?

17:00.455 --> 17:01.913
Shirt?

17:04.845 --> 17:06.125
What happened in Nepal?

17:12.185 --> 17:14.855
Excuse me.

17:17.816 --> 17:20.996
I told you to never mention Nepal,
G.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.415
You crazy?

17:22.440 --> 17:25.068
I bet you it involved Sherpas.

17:25.574 --> 17:27.483
Sherpas?

17:31.789 --> 17:36.177
Razor Mantis?
As in the sexually carnivorous insect?

17:36.201 --> 17:38.013
As in the one
that has a mating ritual

17:38.037 --> 17:42.814
which begins with the female
biting off the male's head?

17:42.838 --> 17:45.795
Nate, this is what I get for opening
up to you about my dating life?

17:46.762 --> 17:50.024
The real Razor Mantis was supposed
to speak at the Rathmore Tech class.

17:50.048 --> 17:52.097
And we're improvising.

17:52.518 --> 17:55.329
Right. Fine.
So, what's my background?

17:55.353 --> 17:58.663
FBI arrested you for stealing files
from the Department of Defence.

17:58.687 --> 18:01.870
And you cut a deal to avoid jail time
in exchange for teaching classes

18:01.894 --> 18:04.560
about the perils of cyber crime.

18:04.988 --> 18:07.041
What if one of the students
checks up on my story?

18:07.065 --> 18:09.126
Consider yourself backstopped.

18:09.150 --> 18:11.971
As far as the legal system
is concerned,

18:11.995 --> 18:15.554
you are the Razor Mantis.

18:15.578 --> 18:18.097
Many of the students
are hackers themselves.

18:18.121 --> 18:21.603
Now, they've heard of you,
but they don't know what you look like.

18:21.627 --> 18:24.893
Hackers are feisty so they might try
to challenge your authority.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.396
Which is what we want.

18:26.420 --> 18:28.776
That's right.
You wanna elicit a response.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.901
And I suspect hubris
will be his downfall.

18:31.925 --> 18:33.699
In terms of your computer skills,

18:33.723 --> 18:36.359
you might be out of your league
with these Rathmore Tech kids.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.411
Oh, please. I have proficiencies

18:38.435 --> 18:41.618
in IPsec architecture, Kerberos,
and PlutoPlus with the FBl...

18:41.642 --> 18:44.249
These kids invented that stuff, so...

18:44.273 --> 18:49.581
These guys have spent more time
with their World of Warcraft avatars

18:49.605 --> 18:52.535
than real women
who aren't called Mom.

18:53.662 --> 18:56.829
Ah. Just in case.

18:58.459 --> 19:00.558
Great.
Because there's nothing I love more

19:00.582 --> 19:04.311
than falling back on my sexuality
to get the job done.

19:04.335 --> 19:08.753
Oh, and those shoes
are crocodile stilettos.

19:10.763 --> 19:13.929
You scuff them,
tear them, lose them,

19:15.350 --> 19:17.972
and I'll end you, tootsie.

19:19.438 --> 19:22.331
Checked out Kaleem's house.
Found a weapon stash.

19:22.355 --> 19:26.083
Two handguns, a semiautomatic rifle
and three more grenades.

19:26.107 --> 19:28.496
Nate says he's more of a follower
than a leader.

19:28.520 --> 19:31.425
- What else?
- He used to work for a tech company.

19:31.449 --> 19:33.585
A.J. Concept Solutions.

19:33.609 --> 19:36.928
It was started up just over a year ago
by a man named Arthur Janson.

19:36.952 --> 19:40.123
- I'm gonna need to meet him.
- I'll track him down for you.

19:40.751 --> 19:43.134
Oh, jeez, these jeans are too tight.

19:43.158 --> 19:45.744
I told you not to mention Nepal.

19:49.551 --> 19:52.149
Okay, everyone.
Take your seats, please.

19:52.173 --> 19:55.027
As you might have heard
from Dr. Knorr,

19:55.051 --> 19:58.675
I'm going to be your guest lecturer
for this afternoon's session.

19:59.353 --> 20:01.405
When I was arrested by the FBI,

20:01.429 --> 20:04.559
I was known as the Razor Mantis.

20:05.442 --> 20:07.126
For eight years, I specialised...

20:07.150 --> 20:09.537
Once they've logged on,
you can scan their hard drives?

20:09.561 --> 20:12.466
Yeah. I'll just be throwing up
additional data on the touch screen.

20:12.490 --> 20:14.781
You'll be picking out anyone
that's suspicious.

20:15.702 --> 20:18.216
- That'll be most of them.
- And we're off.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.593
Predictably, each student
just ran a search for the Razor Mantis.

20:21.617 --> 20:22.799
And check this out.

20:22.823 --> 20:24.935
Today,
we'll be discussing the overlap

20:24.959 --> 20:28.414
of our domestic cyber-crime
community with terrorism abroad.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.270
Question.

20:30.294 --> 20:33.278
Do you think the slave-generated
data bots out of Silicon Valley

20:33.302 --> 20:36.257
are vulnerable
to Sigma 7 overrides?

20:37.099 --> 20:39.530
That is an excellent question.

20:39.554 --> 20:41.529
There could be two answers.

20:41.553 --> 20:43.614
There could be two answers
to that question.

20:43.638 --> 20:46.981
Overrides. There could
be two answers to that question.

20:47.776 --> 20:50.955
Yeah. No kidding.
That's why I asked you of your opinion.

20:50.979 --> 20:52.791
What he's asking makes no sense.

20:52.815 --> 20:54.674
That's because it's a trick question.

20:54.698 --> 20:58.342
Sigma 7 overrides are incompatible
with slave-generated data bots

20:58.366 --> 21:01.348
because those bots can't exist
on single-tuned harmonic filters.

21:01.372 --> 21:05.134
Those data bots can't exist
on a single-tuned harmonic filter.

21:05.158 --> 21:08.087
Anyone else wanna try
and stump me with a trick question?

21:08.422 --> 21:10.805
All right. Fifty hard drives scanned
and downloaded.

21:10.829 --> 21:12.857
We're almost there.

21:12.881 --> 21:17.049
What's the difference between string
system code and MVO-6 languages?

21:17.389 --> 21:19.014
Oh, really? You wanna go there?

21:20.642 --> 21:24.177
Kensi, ignore him. Just look down
at your laptop and hit some keys.

21:24.980 --> 21:26.996
Tell him you'll answer
once the guy to his left

21:27.020 --> 21:29.243
stops messaging him
about your bra size.

21:29.267 --> 21:31.411
I will consider
answering your question

21:31.435 --> 21:35.941
once the guy to your left stops
IMing you about my bra size.

21:39.536 --> 21:42.928
This is what we want. Few guys
are getting paranoid and logging off.

21:42.952 --> 21:44.759
That's what you call
eliciting a reaction.

21:44.783 --> 21:47.769
I'm sending you their names
and search results.

21:47.793 --> 21:52.730
Okay, we've got an outlier. Joel Hardy.
On financial aid. Low income family,

21:52.754 --> 21:54.561
but he's made some big purchases
recently.

21:54.585 --> 21:58.816
2009 Ducati.
Let's see, a trip to Vegas.

21:58.840 --> 22:03.118
And $20,000 in computer hardware.

22:03.142 --> 22:04.317
This could be our hacker.

22:04.341 --> 22:06.975
To your left, seventh row up,
end seat.

22:07.731 --> 22:10.412
He's fidgeting.
He doesn't want to make eye contact.

22:10.436 --> 22:12.851
Yeah, he's hiding something.

22:13.195 --> 22:14.499
Trying to play it cool.

22:14.523 --> 22:18.646
Far more serious than those
incurred in corporate espionage jobs.

22:19.368 --> 22:22.571
All right, Kensi.
Here comes your excuse to follow him.

22:24.248 --> 22:28.115
Excuse me. I have to take this call.
Let's take a ten-minute break.

22:30.546 --> 22:33.357
Someone higher up
financed his spending spree.

22:33.381 --> 22:35.541
He can lead us there.

22:37.219 --> 22:39.046
Eric, tell me about this guy.

22:39.429 --> 22:43.533
Old parking tickets, bad habits,
friends, taste in music, anything.

22:43.557 --> 22:46.453
He shut down his laptop
before I could mine anything relevant.

22:46.477 --> 22:49.183
- Gotta go in cold.
- Just act like it's the first date.

22:50.566 --> 22:51.567
Hey. Hi.

22:54.027 --> 22:56.269
- Do you have a minute?
- No.

22:56.613 --> 22:58.606
And shouldn't you be finishing up
your lecture?

22:59.366 --> 23:02.711
- Shouldn't you be staying to hear it?
- I've got a thing.

23:02.735 --> 23:06.078
- A thing?
- Yeah. Somewhere to be.

23:08.041 --> 23:09.121
Oh, I see.

23:09.668 --> 23:12.265
Okay. Well, I'm sorry I bothered you.

23:12.289 --> 23:14.254
Have fun at your thing.

23:16.300 --> 23:19.004
Wait. Wait.

23:19.344 --> 23:22.179
- Hey, what's she doing?
- She's playing hard to get.

23:23.515 --> 23:26.220
Hey. Hey.

23:27.811 --> 23:29.305
What did you wanna ask me?

23:31.732 --> 23:35.836
- I'm stuck in town for the night.
- Bummer.

23:35.860 --> 23:39.373
Do you know
where I could get a drink or five?

23:39.397 --> 23:40.829
Depends.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.147
You want company?

23:46.872 --> 23:49.659
I got it. Arthur Janson?

23:51.084 --> 23:53.267
You must be the gentleman
my secretary mentioned.

23:53.291 --> 23:55.834
- What can I do for you?
- Yousef Kaleem is dead.

23:56.548 --> 23:58.707
He was your employee.

23:59.051 --> 24:02.005
- You mind telling us about him?
- I'm afraid I don't know that much.

24:02.387 --> 24:05.507
No? He worked here for over a year.

24:06.350 --> 24:09.434
Kaleem was a business associate.

24:10.771 --> 24:15.065
- Are you in a rush, Mr. Janson?
- I don't get close to people on the job.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.708
Trust me. You open that door up,

24:18.732 --> 24:21.656
you're asking for a needy,
whiny, slacker of a colleague.

24:21.949 --> 24:23.692
I know exactly what you mean.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.613
Any details will help.

24:27.162 --> 24:30.589
I hired Kaleem because he was skilled
at writing computer code.

24:30.613 --> 24:32.843
Come to think of it,
lately he's been spouting off

24:32.867 --> 24:34.762
about politics and religion,
on the job.

24:34.786 --> 24:37.263
Real crazy,
venomous anti-American stuff.

24:37.287 --> 24:38.662
Why didn't you just fire him?

24:39.091 --> 24:41.190
Equal Opportunity Act
makes it illegal for me

24:41.214 --> 24:43.377
to fire him
based on his religious views.

24:44.096 --> 24:46.148
I was amused
that he hated the country

24:46.172 --> 24:48.115
that kept him gainfully employed.

24:48.139 --> 24:51.736
That's one of my big complaints
with the mujahideen.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.348
No sense of irony.

24:55.524 --> 24:59.059
Unfortunately,
the same could be said for my clients.

25:00.737 --> 25:02.018
If you'll excuse me.

25:08.328 --> 25:12.243
I don't whine, I'm not needy,
and I don't slack.

25:13.709 --> 25:15.666
Two out of three ain't bad.

25:24.886 --> 25:27.104
Any luck with the semi
and finding the drone?

25:27.128 --> 25:29.631
The kaleidoscope is still looking.

25:36.648 --> 25:39.791
Bet you're the guy who thinks pressing
the elevator button over and over

25:39.815 --> 25:42.523
makes it get there more quickly,
aren't you?

25:47.034 --> 25:48.611
Yeah.

25:52.122 --> 25:54.245
I like the way you party.

25:55.042 --> 25:57.793
- It's only money, right?
- Mm-hm.

26:00.505 --> 26:03.709
You very clearly know
how to spend it.

26:04.676 --> 26:07.653
Well, let's just say I know
the right people and leave it at that.

26:07.677 --> 26:10.313
The right people?
I know all about them.

26:10.337 --> 26:12.318
I've done favours for half
of Silicon Valley.

26:12.342 --> 26:14.153
The other half pays me
for protection.

26:14.177 --> 26:15.871
You dig that?

26:15.895 --> 26:19.562
Running network protection schemes
on yuppies chasing stock options?

26:20.317 --> 26:22.475
Well, it beats working for a living,
doesn't it?

26:23.862 --> 26:25.938
Call it money. Don't call it living.

26:27.949 --> 26:29.609
And what's living to a guy like you?

26:31.244 --> 26:33.652
Bypassing military-grade
quantum cryptography.

26:35.332 --> 26:36.992
And?

26:41.380 --> 26:43.502
Guy's gotta save something
for a second date, right?

26:46.051 --> 26:48.043
- I'll be back.
- All right.

26:48.303 --> 26:50.379
Dom, keep an eye on him.

26:59.898 --> 27:02.816
You look like a man on a mission.

27:03.443 --> 27:06.230
- Uh, maybe later.
- Ohh.

27:32.097 --> 27:33.472
Dom, everything okay in there?

27:36.768 --> 27:38.512
Dom, are you there?

27:44.192 --> 27:45.651
Dom?

27:55.585 --> 27:58.052
This is security cam footage
Eric pulled from the bar.

27:58.076 --> 28:02.039
Joel Hardy walked in that
bathroom less than 30 seconds ago.

28:06.221 --> 28:07.276
Rewind it.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.880
Now hold on that guy
that comes out just after Dom goes in.

28:18.191 --> 28:19.365
Walked right past him.

28:19.389 --> 28:22.461
Don't let it bother you. There's no way
you could've known who he was.

28:22.485 --> 28:25.323
Well, the bad news
is our only lead in this case is dead.

28:26.283 --> 28:29.010
The good news is you're off the hook
for date number two.

28:29.034 --> 28:32.951
Sure. Hop on the Kensi abuse train
and while there's still room onboard.

28:34.624 --> 28:35.929
There. That's him.

28:35.953 --> 28:38.664
Run him
through the facial recognition.

29:05.363 --> 29:08.364
You're not responsible for this, Dom.

29:09.534 --> 29:11.574
You did your job.

29:12.203 --> 29:14.362
And when doing my job
isn't enough?

29:15.248 --> 29:18.582
Come and see me
and we talk about it.

29:22.464 --> 29:24.006
Thanks.

29:26.217 --> 29:28.791
I'm ready to go back to work now.

29:37.938 --> 29:39.076
- Thanks, Rose.
- Okay.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.371
- Let me know if anyone does.
- Oh, I will.

29:41.395 --> 29:45.398
- I'll tell Nate you say hi.
- Yeah, he has a thing about coroners.

29:52.285 --> 29:53.566
- News?
- No.

29:53.912 --> 29:58.135
No one has claimed Kaleem's body yet
or what's left of it.

29:58.159 --> 30:02.378
Extremist views tend to estrange
one from one's friends and family.

30:03.338 --> 30:05.710
I hope the 72 virgins were worth it.

30:06.132 --> 30:08.374
How's the team holding up?

30:11.179 --> 30:15.758
Two bodies in one day.
That's a lot for anyone to handle.

30:16.059 --> 30:17.826
It's to be expected.

30:17.850 --> 30:22.480
It's when they stop being affected
that I begin to worry.

30:24.609 --> 30:27.100
Well, they've got a ways to go
before they get to that point.

30:30.532 --> 30:32.655
That's good to know.

30:47.048 --> 30:49.005
Wake up, sweetheart.

30:49.509 --> 30:52.058
I found this
in Joel Hardy's apartment.

30:52.082 --> 30:54.219
Good enough to fly a UAV, Dom?

30:54.514 --> 30:56.483
With the right software and uplinks,
yeah.

30:56.507 --> 30:58.367
It needs to be hooked up
to a computer.

30:58.391 --> 31:01.453
It's with Eric.
He's trying to crack the encryption.

31:01.477 --> 31:03.864
Let's look at connections.

31:03.888 --> 31:05.892
Starting with Yousef Kaleem.

31:06.818 --> 31:09.367
Okay, Kaleem is the perfect fall guy.

31:09.391 --> 31:11.954
Anti-American views,
strong religious beliefs,

31:11.978 --> 31:13.924
and weak enough for someone
to convince him

31:13.948 --> 31:15.256
to take on the high-risk work

31:15.280 --> 31:17.325
of snatching the UAV
from its landing site.

31:17.704 --> 31:19.495
Joel Hardy.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.222
A whiz kid who could beat
the Air Force at their game,

31:22.246 --> 31:23.508
but he was immature.

31:23.532 --> 31:25.180
He spent his money carelessly.

31:25.204 --> 31:26.552
He did drugs,

31:26.576 --> 31:29.459
and he was reckless enough
to post the UAV footage online.

31:30.133 --> 31:32.682
Which is probably
what got him killed.

31:32.706 --> 31:34.486
Which means
he's not the ringleader.

31:34.510 --> 31:36.944
Captain Briggs, our pilot.

31:36.968 --> 31:38.195
Wild card in the deck.

31:38.219 --> 31:40.905
Well, he's got an axe to grind
with the drone programme

31:40.929 --> 31:43.344
and the brain
to pull off a conspiracy like this,

31:43.938 --> 31:46.608
- but he's not acting like a guilty man.
- Ho, brah!

31:46.900 --> 31:48.857
- Scores.
- What was that?

31:49.319 --> 31:51.110
It's Eric. He caught a break.

31:52.030 --> 31:53.749
I just breached Joel Hardy's laptop.

31:53.773 --> 31:57.340
Level seven nokVault software
with the triple encryption code.

31:57.364 --> 31:59.303
Found a programme
that would enable the user

31:59.327 --> 32:02.473
to penetrate the kind of quantum
encryption used by the Air Force.

32:02.497 --> 32:05.619
Joel sent it
to A.J. Concept Solutions.

32:13.301 --> 32:15.649
We got a hit.
Hamzi Khan. An Afghani.

32:15.673 --> 32:18.147
Former beat cop in Kabul.
Retired in '03.

32:18.171 --> 32:20.613
Not the first guy I'd hire for a hit
in L.A.

32:20.637 --> 32:23.572
His wife died in Afghanistan
in 2007.

32:23.596 --> 32:25.015
Rifqua Khan.

32:25.313 --> 32:27.578
She was the victim of a UAV attack.

32:27.602 --> 32:29.908
A missile blew up the school
where she was a teacher.

32:29.932 --> 32:32.067
She and eight children were killed.

32:32.654 --> 32:34.896
Pulling up her photo now.

32:36.491 --> 32:38.673
Well, she's not an ethnic Afghani.

32:38.697 --> 32:41.252
Rifqua is Arabic for Rebecca.

32:41.276 --> 32:43.661
Janson
has a sister named Rebecca.

32:47.502 --> 32:51.523
So a Predator killed Janson's sister,
who happens to be married to Khan.

32:51.547 --> 32:55.083
And now they want to give America
a taste of drone warfare.

32:57.470 --> 32:58.501
Hey, Eric.

33:00.432 --> 33:04.026
Thanks. Kaleidoscope
just picked up our 18-wheeler.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.686
Pulled out of a warehouse
downtown.

33:13.069 --> 33:14.694
He's headed south.

33:15.405 --> 33:17.563
His route lines up
with the Port of L.A.

33:29.586 --> 33:31.222
- Show your hands.
- Show me your hands.

33:31.246 --> 33:32.963
- Put them up.
- Get out of the truck.

33:33.339 --> 33:35.937
- Get out.
- Please, I was just doing my job.

33:35.961 --> 33:38.435
- Face down.
- Get down on the ground.

33:38.459 --> 33:39.988
- Spread them out.
- I got him.

33:40.012 --> 33:42.694
This guy just needs this truck
dropped off at the port.

33:42.718 --> 33:43.970
Don't move.

33:48.021 --> 33:50.322
- This guy?
- Yeah.

33:50.346 --> 33:53.524
- Yeah, that's him.
- Face down.

34:02.202 --> 34:04.051
- We've been had.
- Yeah.

34:04.075 --> 34:06.013
Callen, we've got a situation here.

34:06.037 --> 34:08.507
Janson wasn't trying to move
the drone out of the country.

34:08.531 --> 34:10.592
He wanted it airborne.

34:10.617 --> 34:12.536
The transponder just went online.

34:12.962 --> 34:14.125
Where's it headed?

34:15.715 --> 34:18.253
It's circling Los Angeles.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.952
I tapped into the LAX
air-traffic control system.

34:30.976 --> 34:34.130
It shows an unidentified aircraft
circling Marina del Rey

34:34.155 --> 34:36.541
- at 10,000 feet.
- What are our options?

34:36.565 --> 34:38.592
Crash the Air Force's
satellite drone server.

34:38.616 --> 34:39.877
Sounds like a good idea.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.427
Every UAV around the world
would go haywire.

34:42.451 --> 34:44.342
Dozens of missions
would be compromised.

34:44.367 --> 34:45.681
None of which is as important

34:45.705 --> 34:47.953
as preventing a terrorist attack
on American soil.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.348
It's not gonna work.

34:52.371 --> 34:54.518
Janson installed
his own server overrides.

34:54.543 --> 34:57.400
He knows what he's doing.
Bypassing them will take hours.

34:57.424 --> 34:59.815
How long would it take to scramble
F-22 out of Edwards?

34:59.839 --> 35:02.565
Including flight time,
20 minutes tops.

35:02.589 --> 35:05.723
It's too long. Eric, find Janson.

35:15.031 --> 35:17.759
I told you guys everything I know.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.409
Your UAV is airborne.

35:22.246 --> 35:26.576
- Where?
- Up there, somewhere, circling.

35:27.710 --> 35:30.380
We think the guy who hijacked it
is gonna use it.

35:31.381 --> 35:33.420
Nobody listened to me.

35:33.841 --> 35:35.193
You see?

35:35.217 --> 35:38.136
You see what happens when you
replace men with computer systems?

35:41.474 --> 35:44.451
Eric triangulated the UAV signal
to this location.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.933
Janson's gotta be around here
somewhere.

36:05.665 --> 36:07.539
Joystick, throttle.

36:08.292 --> 36:12.207
This was used to get control
of your UAV.

36:14.173 --> 36:18.385
We're gonna hack into the system
and get it back.

36:20.096 --> 36:22.029
I watched a friend die.

36:22.053 --> 36:25.722
I couldn't help him.
I can't do that again.

36:35.486 --> 36:37.230
Last night,

36:39.282 --> 36:42.982
I watched a kid bleed out
on the floor of a bathroom

36:44.996 --> 36:48.910
because I couldn't get there in time
to save him.

36:52.045 --> 36:54.251
There's nothing I can do to fix that.

36:56.591 --> 36:58.963
I don't get a second chance.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.050
But you do.

37:11.898 --> 37:13.937
Sometimes our best
isn't good enough.

37:15.109 --> 37:16.568
True.

37:18.613 --> 37:21.234
But that's no reason
to give anything less.

37:25.578 --> 37:28.662
All right, I've gone to Janson's network
firewall. I just need to bypass...

37:31.167 --> 37:32.851
Sam, I'm in.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.953
I've got his targeting information.

37:35.797 --> 37:38.751
Holy crap.
William F. Cooley High School.

37:44.097 --> 37:45.816
Eric, get that school evacuated now.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.529
- I'm calling L.A.P.D.
- Not fast enough.

37:48.553 --> 37:50.683
Got it.
Now commencing with fast enough.

37:59.195 --> 38:02.540
I need specifics, Eric.
Anything that might give Janson away.

38:02.564 --> 38:04.376
All right, if he's controlling the drone,

38:04.400 --> 38:07.410
he's gonna need a satellite dish
or antenna array.

38:17.630 --> 38:18.637
Sam, I found it.

38:18.661 --> 38:21.307
- Where?
- Janson is on a yacht called Rebecca.

38:21.331 --> 38:24.000
- Let's go.
- It's docked in Slip 15.

38:27.515 --> 38:29.400
Wow, how you doing?

38:29.424 --> 38:32.696
- Unbelievable. Is this a Lungelli?
- This is a private vessel.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.991
What do you think this is?
Thirty-five metres? Maybe 40?

38:36.015 --> 38:38.516
You know,
I bet you this is actually 40.

38:38.776 --> 38:42.121
Composite hull. This is unbelievable.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.899
- Get back.
- It's beautiful.

38:46.367 --> 38:49.321
- Kensi, hostile down. Slip 15.
- I'm on the way.

38:52.415 --> 38:55.866
This is a long shot.
This gear has all sorts of bugs.

39:03.009 --> 39:06.045
It isn't working. It's not responding.

39:06.762 --> 39:08.530
I'm out of time.
I can't hack the drone.

39:08.554 --> 39:11.926
If you can't hack the drone,
can you hack the missile instead?

39:30.578 --> 39:32.950
Don't do it. Don't do it.

39:37.335 --> 39:39.043
You're too late.

39:42.632 --> 39:44.007
Come on. Come on.

39:46.844 --> 39:47.875
I got it.

39:56.312 --> 39:58.577
You guys got a place
you wanna ditch this missile?

39:58.601 --> 40:00.267
I believe we do.

40:10.952 --> 40:12.743
Hey.

40:15.164 --> 40:16.279
Thanks.

40:28.970 --> 40:30.547
Good night, Hetty.

40:30.888 --> 40:33.344
That Nepal story was crazy.

40:33.808 --> 40:34.887
You told Sam?

40:51.576 --> 40:55.170
- She didn't really tell you, did she?
- Sorry, G. It's classified.

40:55.194 --> 40:59.890
Oh, Chinese takeout and a glass
of red wine never looked so good.

40:59.914 --> 41:01.699
I thought you had a date
with that guy tonight.

41:01.723 --> 41:03.193
- The one who...
- Cancelled on him.

41:04.547 --> 41:05.898
- Kensi.
- Hey, Kensi.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.130
- Is Dom there?
- Yeah, he's here.

41:08.801 --> 41:11.470
It's Nate. Still wanna talk to him?

41:13.389 --> 41:14.848
I'm good.

41:16.684 --> 41:18.262
He's good.
