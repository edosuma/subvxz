MiniBen314
(Liaison Team)

03:22.411 --> 03:23.410
Did you eat?

03:24.246 --> 03:25.996
Well, that's infortunate.

03:29.651 --> 03:30.751
You made it.

03:37.612 --> 03:41.011
I saw you following the taxi
in the station wagon.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.553
I wasn't follow you, Walter.

03:42.678 --> 03:44.265
We were coming to the same place.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.768
You don't trust me.

03:53.445 --> 03:54.420
It's a Chinese merchant ship

03:54.545 --> 03:55.587
Registered in Hong Kong.

03:55.712 --> 03:56.569
Four hours ago,

03:56.737 --> 03:58.786
It ran aground and caught fire.

03:58.911 --> 04:01.453
Strong current, freezing water.

04:01.578 --> 04:03.367
They died attempting to swim ashore.

04:03.535 --> 04:06.019
We pulled out 27 bodies so far.

04:06.144 --> 04:08.220
At first, it appeared
they all died of hypothermia.

04:08.345 --> 04:09.790
And then we found these.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.944
Excuse us, Agent.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.387
Dr. Bishop, have you ever seen
anything like this?

04:23.555 --> 04:26.223
It's similar to a tiny parasite

04:26.391 --> 04:28.545
Found in Livestock.

04:30.678 --> 04:34.478
I've never seen them
this size, or in humans.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.819
I want this creature
transported back to my lab.

04:49.944 --> 04:52.458
It might still be alive.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.011
This woman's still breathing!

05:00.592 --> 05:02.578
Step aside please.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.640
We haven't much time.
If she's also infected,

05:07.808 --> 05:08.891
we've got to get
this organism out her.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.894
Go!

05:52.990 --> 05:54.932
{PUB}My name's Tao Chen.
I'm from the Chinese consulate.

05:55.057 --> 05:56.397
The woman we pulled from the water,

05:56.565 --> 05:57.765
how long has she been awake?

05:57.890 --> 06:00.232
About an hour.
Is she talking?

06:00.357 --> 06:02.366
A little.
Her name's Mai Lin.

06:02.491 --> 06:04.199
She's from outside of Hong Kong.

06:04.324 --> 06:06.032
She happen to mention
how she got a gigantic worm

06:06.157 --> 06:07.399
stuck in her stomach?

06:07.524 --> 06:09.785
Doctor said she just had
a severe case of dehydration.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.857
No worm.
She wasn't infected.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.754
She says they came for work
and a better life.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.065
She asked if we're gonna arrest her.

06:27.190 --> 06:28.399
I told her we're just here to help.

06:28.524 --> 06:29.680
I didn't know you spoke Cantonese.

06:29.848 --> 06:30.931
Get to know me a bit.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.432
She says she doesn't know.

06:35.557 --> 06:36.895
The men on the boat...
they knew.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.065
They gave her medicine
for seasickness.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.818
Everyone got it.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.949
But her father was a fisherman...

06:45.074 --> 06:47.189
So she was used to the sea...
So she didn't take it.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.416
She wants you to help her find
her daughter and husband.

06:59.541 --> 07:01.245
She... She doesn't know
what happened to her family.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.815
Crewmen said they were two days
behind on another boat.

07:06.940 --> 07:07.940
There's another boat?

07:08.136 --> 07:10.004
Yeah, so chances are
they're infected too.

07:10.222 --> 07:13.173
Okay, that gives us
maybe 36 hours before it lands.

07:16.107 --> 07:18.187
Seven pounds and ten ounces.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.249
Walter, this is
our largest worm yet.

07:20.374 --> 07:23.192
Parasitic worm to be precise.

07:23.374 --> 07:26.070
Truly, Agent Farnsworth,
it never ceases to amaze me

07:26.274 --> 07:30.316
the infinite variation
that mother nature gives us.

07:30.441 --> 07:33.316
She truly has quite
a disturbing sense of humor.

07:33.441 --> 07:35.496
Considering your new pet,

07:35.673 --> 07:37.581
I think mother nature's
a real bitch.

07:39.640 --> 07:40.615
How's it going in here?

07:40.740 --> 07:41.994
You mean here at Bishop's live bait?

07:43.807 --> 07:47.382
Actually, I think these things
would scare off the fish, don't you?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.515
We spoke to the woman
we found on the beach

07:49.640 --> 07:51.249
and she said that everyone
on that boat

07:51.374 --> 07:54.098
took some sort of capsule medicine.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.615
Actually, Mai Lin's the only one

07:55.740 --> 07:57.282
who didn't take the capsule
and she's the only one

07:57.407 --> 07:58.227
who didn't get affected.

07:58.407 --> 07:59.481
So do you think it's possible

07:59.606 --> 08:03.015
that that could've been
inside the capsule?

08:03.140 --> 08:04.733
Of course.
It makes perfect sense.

08:04.907 --> 08:06.949
If the time of gestation

08:07.074 --> 08:09.249
is equal to the time of transport,

08:09.374 --> 08:10.989
it would explain
why the creatures need

08:11.174 --> 08:12.407
the host.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.615
These bodies
provide nutrition, warmth,

08:14.740 --> 08:16.182
and protective shelter.

08:16.307 --> 08:19.289
They enable the parasite to grow.

08:19.474 --> 08:20.874
Are you saying that these people

08:21.042 --> 08:22.417
Were used as some sort
of human incubator?

08:22.585 --> 08:23.919
Quite ingenious, really.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.215
And yes to your question.

08:25.340 --> 08:28.215
It is possible
for the larvae of the parasite

08:28.407 --> 08:29.748
To fit into a capsule.

08:29.873 --> 08:30.843
It would allow

08:31.040 --> 08:33.881
The parasite to grow
on the journey here.

08:34.006 --> 08:35.615
Which leaves "why?"

08:35.740 --> 08:37.215
Why would someone
be smuggling these in?

08:39.940 --> 08:41.687
It's Broyles.

08:41.873 --> 08:43.605
The coast guard found a manifest

08:43.773 --> 08:46.275
On the sunken Chinese ship.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.615
They traced it to a local shipyard.

08:47.740 --> 08:49.615
Somebody is in custody now.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.614
Find out everything else you can
on those worms, all right?

08:52.782 --> 08:55.534
Parasitic worms.

09:37.573 --> 09:38.782
We found him at the shipyard

09:38.907 --> 09:40.329
Where the boat was supposed to dock.

09:40.507 --> 09:43.999
He had just finished burning
every document in the place.

09:44.174 --> 09:46.251
We're letting him sweat
before we question him.

09:46.441 --> 09:47.294
He's not gonna talk.

09:47.474 --> 09:48.481
He's a Triad gang member.

09:48.606 --> 09:49.671
They got a strict code of honor.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.841
Triad? You sure?

09:53.009 --> 09:54.384
Yeah, his whole biography's

09:54.573 --> 09:55.615
Written on him in ink.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.215
He's like a decorated soldier.

09:57.340 --> 09:58.416
See the mark on his arm there,

09:58.541 --> 09:59.682
The extra powerful hook?

09:59.807 --> 10:01.099
That means he's killed five people.

10:01.274 --> 10:03.769
He also enjoys broadway shows,
long walks on the beach.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.416
The one on his neck,

10:06.541 --> 10:08.049
It says Sun Hong Triad.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.316
Sun Hong is known

10:09.507 --> 10:11.349
For smuggling heroin
out of the golden triangle,

10:11.474 --> 10:12.819
Not trafficking people.

10:13.007 --> 10:15.648
Then they're expanding
their business.

10:15.773 --> 10:17.982
What if Sun Hong Triad
are still dealing in narcotics?

10:18.107 --> 10:19.326
How's that?

10:19.507 --> 10:20.748
Walter said these people
were implanted

10:20.873 --> 10:21.982
With the worm on purpose.

10:22.107 --> 10:23.580
That seems to imply
that they're valuable, right?

10:23.748 --> 10:25.215
Certain species of parasite
have been known

10:25.340 --> 10:26.615
To naturally secrete opiates.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.502
If someone had figured out
how to harvest those...

10:28.673 --> 10:29.628
you think those worms

10:29.840 --> 10:31.840
Are some kind of new street drug?

10:34.274 --> 10:36.182
He's got a razor blade!

10:36.307 --> 10:38.011
This is Broyles.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.429
We have a code blue
in interview three.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.847
We need security and paramedics
immediately.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.609
{PUB}If only all parasitic worms

10:52.777 --> 10:54.569
Were full of narcotics.

10:54.694 --> 10:57.036
Careful, careful!
Not too deep.

10:57.161 --> 11:00.242
I got it, Walter.
Just... hold still.

11:00.888 --> 11:04.502
Well, given the high cost
of transporting the creature,

11:04.627 --> 11:06.802
It must be quite a high.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.667
You are not smoking this thing.

11:11.326 --> 11:13.797
Now that should do the trick.

11:13.965 --> 11:16.883
Now with some luck, we'll find
the active ingredient.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.335
Wait, wait, wait.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.229
The initial feeling
is quite something.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.669
This thing is feeding on you.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.943
This is... This is... This is
rather pleasant.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.969
I didn't see you there.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.293
Where can I find Agent Dunham?

11:51.461 --> 11:54.835
She's in the back with Peter, sir.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.936
So the question is
if there is a black market

11:59.061 --> 12:00.427
For this drug, then who's buying it?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.569
Sir.

12:04.694 --> 12:05.802
That's everything the bureau has

12:05.927 --> 12:07.768
On the Sun Hong Triad.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.101
There's also information
on the Triad's suspected leader.

12:10.226 --> 12:12.268
He goes by the name of Jon Su.

12:12.393 --> 12:14.036
His present whereabouts are unknown.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.936
These are corporate bank documents.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.702
Shell companies to shield
his criminal activity.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.569
What about the boat carrying
Mai Lin's family?

12:20.694 --> 12:21.635
Any word?

12:21.824 --> 12:22.902
Nothing.

12:23.027 --> 12:24.669
The coast guard has begun
boarding and searching

12:24.794 --> 12:26.168
All vessels coming into new england.

12:26.293 --> 12:29.331
200 ships by the count.
No small task.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.124
More like a needle in a haystack.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.068
So we have about 20 hours
before the worms come out.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.235
There was a wire two weeks ago
from a bank here in Boston.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.669
It looks like a private account
in Beacon Hill transferred

12:40.843 --> 12:42.773
$500,000 paid into...

12:43.189 --> 12:45.180
BeiJing Executive Construction.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.302
Two weeks ago is about the same time

12:46.427 --> 12:47.502
The traffickers left Kalun.

12:47.684 --> 12:48.969
Sounds like someone's

12:49.185 --> 12:49.976
Financing those shipments.

12:59.794 --> 13:00.936
So this is where the other end

13:01.114 --> 13:03.002
Of a Triad bank wire leads.

13:03.127 --> 13:05.127
Not what I pictured either.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.735
Hi. Are your parents home?

13:12.917 --> 13:13.834
Who are you?

13:14.002 --> 13:15.936
We're the FBI.
Who are you?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.535
I'm Matt.

13:18.660 --> 13:20.173
Can I see, like, a badge?

13:24.660 --> 13:27.168
Mom, some FBI people are here!

13:27.348 --> 13:28.598
Come on in.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.802
As my financial advisor
explained it to me,

13:33.927 --> 13:34.869
There was money to be made

13:34.994 --> 13:36.731
In BeiJing Construction projects.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.235
I invested a half a million dollars

13:38.360 --> 13:40.735
With this company.

13:40.860 --> 13:43.363
Did you ever meet a man
named Jon Su?

13:43.531 --> 13:45.532
He was the head
of the company you invested in.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.769
No. Never.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.101
Maybe your husband then.

13:48.286 --> 13:51.368
He passed away
shortly after Matt was born.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.402
I'm sorry.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.468
Did I do something wrong?

13:54.593 --> 13:57.602
We suspect Mr. Su
of running a smuggling ring,

13:57.795 --> 13:59.302
Trafficking Chinese nationals
into the US,

13:59.505 --> 14:02.268
And using these
front corporations to fund it.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.544
I had no idea.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.735
I swear to both of you,

14:08.860 --> 14:10.335
My attorney reviewed
all the documents

14:10.460 --> 14:12.802
And he assured me it was
a sound investment.

14:12.927 --> 14:14.802
These corporations look legitimate

14:14.927 --> 14:16.229
From the outside.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.168
May we have the name
and number of your attorney?

14:18.358 --> 14:21.302
- We'll need to ask him a few questions.
- Of course.

14:21.427 --> 14:24.135
I'm sure he'd be as surprised
by this as I am.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.835
If I can do anything to help...

14:26.032 --> 14:29.367
thank you.
We appreciate it.

14:35.427 --> 14:36.583
What were you doing in there,

14:36.751 --> 14:38.752
Checking for dust?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.268
Not sure yet.

14:40.393 --> 14:41.802
Okay, I want to stop by
the hospital,

14:41.927 --> 14:43.635
Check on Mai Lin.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.569
You drop me at the lab first?

14:46.694 --> 14:47.761
Sure.

14:48.802 --> 14:49.936
What do you think the connection is

14:50.061 --> 14:52.535
Between an excessive compulsive
germaphobe and our worms?

14:52.660 --> 14:54.702
Nice kicks.
Thank you.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.569
That's an excellent question.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.502
I have a theory.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.036
What happened to you?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.635
Your father got bitten

15:02.819 --> 15:05.969
By that thing and he refuses
to get it checked out.

15:06.094 --> 15:08.635
What if you're infected
with one of those worms?

15:08.825 --> 15:10.135
I've tested my blood
and liver function.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.669
I'm fine.

15:11.794 --> 15:14.368
In fact, my white cell count
is through the roof,

15:14.539 --> 15:17.302
I have several new antibodies
in my blood,

15:17.427 --> 15:19.201
And even the gas I had is gone.

15:19.326 --> 15:21.368
And you think it's the worm
that did all that to you?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.669
The creature, Peter,

15:23.881 --> 15:26.435
Is not an illicit narcotic at all.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.569
It's medicine.

15:27.858 --> 15:30.408
Astrid, the picture.
Show Peter, please.

15:31.827 --> 15:33.635
Ancylostoma duodenale.

15:33.760 --> 15:34.869
An intestinal hookworm.

15:34.994 --> 15:37.068
It's about ten millimeters long.

15:37.193 --> 15:38.602
Chinese medicine.

15:38.727 --> 15:40.101
Ancylostoma could be used

15:40.226 --> 15:42.036
For the treatment of chronic asthma.

15:42.161 --> 15:44.802
People are purposefully infected

15:44.927 --> 15:47.969
And walk around
their entire lives with it.

15:48.094 --> 15:51.468
What does that have to
do with our parasites?

15:51.593 --> 15:54.602
Our parasites are a new species.

15:54.727 --> 15:57.268
Bio-engineered from this hookworm.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.602
You mean somebody made these.

15:59.727 --> 16:01.235
Designed them to grow in humans.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.635
In fact, I don't believe

16:03.760 --> 16:06.402
That they could grow anywhere else.

16:06.591 --> 16:09.402
I believe that it's
the parasite's lymph gland

16:09.527 --> 16:10.769
That is the real prize.

16:10.894 --> 16:12.335
It secretes

16:12.513 --> 16:15.669
A remarkable immune-boosting enzyme.

16:15.794 --> 16:17.902
Immune-boosting.

16:18.027 --> 16:19.502
So you might take that
if you had, say,

16:19.627 --> 16:21.396
A severe phobia of germs.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.735
Or if you wanted to treat any number

16:22.860 --> 16:25.108
Of immune deficiency disorders.

16:26.660 --> 16:27.735
Going somewhere, Walter?

16:27.904 --> 16:29.535
I am.

16:29.660 --> 16:33.002
The phone book lists
five herbalists in Chinatown,

16:33.127 --> 16:35.302
Three of which sell
our ancylostoma hookworm

16:35.427 --> 16:37.002
For the treatment of asthma.

16:37.127 --> 16:39.869
I am going to collect samples
for genetic comparison.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.235
Why don't you give me
those addresses?

16:41.360 --> 16:42.802
I'll go check them out.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.135
You don't believe I can do it.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.468
Well, I can.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.883
Don't you dare follow me.

17:01.894 --> 17:04.894
Can I please borrow
some change for the bus fare?

17:06.442 --> 17:08.602
Miss Lin, do you recognize these?

17:16.993 --> 17:20.163
She said the man who put them
on the fishing boat had one.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.902
What does it mean?
It's a gang tattoo.

17:23.027 --> 17:24.959
We think that the gang

17:25.127 --> 17:27.769
might be using people to smuggle
drugs into the country.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.335
She said her husband
and her daughter...

17:37.460 --> 17:38.835
I think I understand.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.684
We will do everything that we can.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.394
{PUB}Where is everybody?

18:34.519 --> 18:36.961
Walter's out self-actualizing again.

18:37.086 --> 18:38.324
Astrid's keeping an eye on him.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.528
What's this?

18:39.653 --> 18:40.910
You remember
at Elizabeth Jarvis' house

18:41.120 --> 18:42.370
You asked me what I was looking at?

18:42.552 --> 18:45.206
Did you see
all those hand sanitizers?

18:45.374 --> 18:46.861
All the windows
were hermetically sealed.

18:46.986 --> 18:48.251
Hepa filters. Oxygen tanks.

18:48.419 --> 18:49.502
You saw oxygen tanks?

18:51.185 --> 18:52.464
But I'm sure they're there
somewhere.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.882
Okay, and if they were?

18:54.053 --> 18:57.494
Walter says that these worms
boost the immune system, right?

18:57.619 --> 18:59.194
If you're buying
hand sanitizer in bulk

18:59.319 --> 19:00.761
And hermetically sealing
all your windows,

19:00.886 --> 19:02.640
You're either Howard Hughes
or you're actually sick.

19:02.808 --> 19:06.352
Let's go pick up Elizabeth Jarvis and
get a warrant to search her house.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.481
Actually, I've got a better idea.

19:11.386 --> 19:13.610
Bend your knees more.

19:13.786 --> 19:14.986
What are you doing here?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.027
We wanted to ask you
a couple questions

19:17.152 --> 19:18.531
About your mother.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.991
Yeah, well,
she's not here right now.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.534
And I know
that I don't have to answer

19:21.702 --> 19:23.953
Any of your questions
without my mom or lawyer here.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.227
Then you can just talk to me.

19:28.352 --> 19:30.168
I'm not actually an FBI Agent.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.337
Just a couple of guys
hanging out on the court.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.964
I'm gonna go make a phone call.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.050
I have to talk to a judge
about a warrant.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.061
There you go.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.604
I know you don't want to talk to us

19:49.786 --> 19:51.895
'Cause you're just trying
to protect your mother, Matt.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.066
She's your only family.

19:55.053 --> 19:56.236
I understand that.
I've been there.

19:56.404 --> 19:57.862
I doubt it.

20:00.753 --> 20:02.803
I was raised by my mother too.

20:03.919 --> 20:04.969
It's scary.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.540
You're worried that if you lose her,

20:08.708 --> 20:10.519
Then you have no one.

20:11.986 --> 20:13.586
But those people that
your mother gave money to,

20:13.754 --> 20:16.261
They're scary people.

20:16.386 --> 20:20.160
We're investigating them
and that's not gonna stop.

20:20.285 --> 20:22.971
They're gonna try
to cover their tracks.

20:23.152 --> 20:24.528
I want to make sure that your mother

20:24.653 --> 20:25.849
Isn't one of those tracks.

20:27.953 --> 20:29.310
You think that could happen?

20:32.219 --> 20:34.119
I need you to tell me, Matt,

20:35.319 --> 20:36.484
Is your mom sick?

20:38.988 --> 20:40.461
What is it?

20:40.586 --> 20:42.574
She has some sort
of immune deficiency disorder?

20:51.285 --> 20:53.918
The treatments are for me.

21:25.653 --> 21:28.119
Walter, what a...
what a coincidence.

21:28.741 --> 21:31.941
It's not a coincidence at all.
You were following me.

21:32.552 --> 21:33.625
Peter had you follow me.

21:33.793 --> 21:37.712
No. I have a...
I have a friend that lives

21:37.886 --> 21:39.261
Right down...

21:39.386 --> 21:40.924
by the...

21:41.092 --> 21:42.800
the Chinese restaurant.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.182
We're worried about you.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.644
Does it occur to you
that perhaps I want to be alone?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.794
That perhaps I want to live my life

21:54.919 --> 21:55.855
With a semblance

21:56.023 --> 21:58.358
Of dignity and self-respect?

21:58.526 --> 22:01.402
If I want to go get
a hot dog, so be it.

22:01.586 --> 22:05.461
I may go grocery shopping.

22:05.586 --> 22:07.367
I may even join a gym.

22:11.753 --> 22:12.705
I'm sorry.

22:18.285 --> 22:21.194
Well, since you're here,
you may as well accompany me

22:21.319 --> 22:22.757
To the next herbalist on my list.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.011
But as a friend, not a supervisor.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.597
Agreed, Walter.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.143
I love Chinatown.

22:34.319 --> 22:37.861
Matt Jarvis suffers from a rare
immune deficiency disorder.

22:37.986 --> 22:40.127
His body doesn't produce
enough white blood cells

22:40.252 --> 22:41.317
To fight off infection.

22:41.486 --> 22:42.694
Yeah, technically speaking,

22:42.819 --> 22:44.528
This kid should be living
in a giant plastic baggie.

22:44.653 --> 22:46.072
But we just shot hoops
with him this afternoon.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.494
So these parasites
are being harvested

22:47.619 --> 22:48.491
To treat his condition.

22:48.659 --> 22:49.794
Well, from what he says,

22:49.919 --> 22:52.127
They insert a medicinal powder
directly into his spleen.

22:52.252 --> 22:53.861
Walter thinks the medicine's
made out of a gland

22:53.986 --> 22:54.914
Inside the worm.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.528
So Matt's usually treated
once a month.

22:57.653 --> 22:59.394
His next surgery is due in two days,

22:59.519 --> 23:01.629
Right on schedule with when
the next boat's due to arrive.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.173
- Does the surgeon have a name?
- Dr. Che.

23:04.352 --> 23:07.552
Ancylostoma duodenale.
Hookworm.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.661
Aren't they magnificent?

23:09.786 --> 23:11.264
At this size maybe.

23:11.452 --> 23:12.432
Quite right.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.761
You haven't seen anything

23:13.886 --> 23:16.144
Till you've seen one of these
four feet long.

23:16.319 --> 23:19.027
What do I owe you?

23:19.152 --> 23:21.274
That'll be $15, please.

23:21.442 --> 23:24.127
I got this.
No, that's okay.

23:24.252 --> 23:27.155
I have just enough money left.

23:29.519 --> 23:31.826
$15.
Thank you.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.152
Good day.

23:46.719 --> 23:49.177
I'm going to enjoy this.

23:49.452 --> 23:50.970
Provided, of course, the beans

23:51.152 --> 23:53.389
Have been properly soaked
to leech toxicity.

23:53.586 --> 23:54.557
For the record,

23:54.753 --> 23:57.386
I wanted ice cream.

24:01.653 --> 24:02.982
Look.

24:03.152 --> 24:05.694
Lacquered cricket boxes.

24:05.819 --> 24:06.944
You want omega-3?

24:07.120 --> 24:08.196
I put in fish head.

24:08.386 --> 24:10.782
No, I will pass.

24:10.953 --> 24:13.701
Thank you.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.996
Here you go.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.361
Given what her kid said,

24:28.486 --> 24:30.427
I want you to lean
to Elizabeth Jarvis.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.720
We're running out of time
before that boat arrives.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.936
So how much rice candy
did Walter eat?

24:40.120 --> 24:41.494
I lost him.

24:41.619 --> 24:44.427
I turned my back for one second
and he wasn't there any more.

24:44.552 --> 24:46.160
I've looked for him
everywhere, Peter.

24:46.285 --> 24:47.652
Did he know that you were
following him?

24:47.853 --> 24:50.394
Yeah, he did at first.
And he was fine with it.

24:50.519 --> 24:52.824
But he lulled me into a false
sense of security.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.075
Just so he could ditch you.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.194
Well, you know how he likes

24:55.319 --> 24:56.369
To prove a point.

24:56.552 --> 24:59.461
He's got plenty
of change for the bus.

24:59.586 --> 25:00.661
He's got his travel kit on him.

25:00.786 --> 25:02.458
All his emergency numbers.
He should be fine.

25:02.653 --> 25:04.728
He's got to learn how to cross
the street by himself sometime.

25:04.853 --> 25:08.394
I'm gonna...
Gonna head back to the lab

25:08.519 --> 25:11.786
And see if he's there, okay?

25:49.290 --> 25:52.758
{PUB}- It's Walter, your father.
- <i>Wrong number.</i>

25:57.681 --> 26:00.132
It's me, Walter, your father.

26:01.756 --> 26:03.790
Excuse me?

26:11.357 --> 26:14.165
I-I-I fear I may have dialed
the wrong number again.

26:14.290 --> 26:17.790
My name is Walter...

27:06.324 --> 27:08.132
The number five bus
hasn't stopped here

27:08.257 --> 27:11.299
For over two hours.

27:11.424 --> 27:13.798
Not that it matters.

27:13.923 --> 27:18.351
I used up all my bus fare
to dial seven wrong numbers.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.101
I can't remember Peter's number.

27:27.336 --> 27:32.032
It's got three 5s, a 1, a 0, two 7s.

27:32.157 --> 27:33.265
But for the life of me,

27:34.418 --> 27:37.009
I can't remember
the correct sequence.

27:50.767 --> 27:51.967
What happened?

27:53.672 --> 27:55.464
I'm gonna call you an ambulance.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.698
No. Don't.
I'm okay, Peter.

27:57.823 --> 27:59.332
I'm okay.
I don't need an ambulance.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.137
Who did this to you?

28:02.591 --> 28:04.332
I don't know.

28:04.457 --> 28:06.392
It was...
two big asian guys

28:06.560 --> 28:07.852
With tattoos.
Triad.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.146
I don't know how they knew
we had the worm.

28:11.723 --> 28:13.832
They must've followed you
back from Chinatown.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.199
It's Walter.
He's down in Chinatown.

28:29.324 --> 28:31.032
Apparently he's fine.

28:31.157 --> 28:33.032
Astrid, you sure you're okay?

28:33.212 --> 28:34.332
I'm going down to pick him up.

28:34.505 --> 28:35.732
I'm going to talk
to Elizabeth Jarvis.

28:35.857 --> 28:37.631
Let's stay in touch.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.425
You got it.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.473
Mrs. Jarvis, we know you're
withholding information.

28:45.641 --> 28:48.466
I already told you everything.

28:48.591 --> 28:50.853
Actually, your son
told us everything.

28:54.623 --> 28:56.484
I can't help you, Agent Dunham.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.832
I've got two dozen
Chinese nationals dead,

28:58.957 --> 29:00.299
A federal Agent assaulted,

29:00.424 --> 29:01.466
And another boat

29:01.591 --> 29:03.732
With God knows how many people
about to die on it.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.765
You don't understand.

29:05.890 --> 29:08.299
This treatment...

29:08.424 --> 29:10.039
Matt won't live long without it.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.199
We rescued a Chinese woman.

29:12.324 --> 29:14.168
He daughter is on that other boat.

29:14.336 --> 29:15.544
She's gonna die too.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.171
Who's been treating your son?

29:50.023 --> 29:51.399
Hello, my son.

29:51.524 --> 29:54.083
Allow me to introduce you.

29:54.251 --> 29:57.044
My hostess's name is Fey.

30:05.801 --> 30:08.722
Walter, the numbers
are in your pocket.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.725
How many times have I told you that?

30:11.893 --> 30:13.853
I put them there.
Don't you remember that?

30:15.637 --> 30:17.440
No. No, I don't.

30:18.994 --> 30:20.265
You... You just...

30:30.203 --> 30:31.203
Are you okay?

30:34.055 --> 30:35.255
Yes, I'm fine.

30:47.190 --> 30:48.990
The noodles are delicious.

30:50.710 --> 30:52.516
You really should try them, Peter.

31:02.625 --> 31:06.614
I hope I didn't cause
Agent Farnsworth too much distress.

31:07.539 --> 31:09.689
She had other things on her mind.

31:10.179 --> 31:12.263
Wouldn't happen to remember
any of the addresses

31:12.388 --> 31:14.498
of those herbalist shops
you visited, would you?

31:14.623 --> 31:17.723
Certainly not, but...
that's why I held on to this.

31:19.572 --> 31:22.032
Astrid only went with...
with me to the...

31:22.157 --> 31:23.752
third one, Ming Che.

31:24.053 --> 31:27.011
They had quite a selection
of hookworms.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.199
Although I confess
I exaggerated a bit

31:29.324 --> 31:31.680
when I told them
that ours was four foot long.

31:33.234 --> 31:35.529
You told someone
we have a four foot worm?

31:35.654 --> 31:37.061
It's not even two feet.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.231
That's how they followed Astrid.
Ming Che on Ping-On street.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.984
What do you mean?
Astrid was followed?

31:45.792 --> 31:48.690
- Is Walter all right?
- He's fine. Where are you?

31:48.815 --> 31:51.909
<i>The boat with Mai Lin's family
on it just docked. Elizabeth Jarvis</i>

31:52.077 --> 31:55.298
gave us a phone number. We tracked
a few shore-to-ship calls off that.

31:55.423 --> 31:57.873
We're just about
to commence the raid.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.918
- I got another lead I'm tracking down.
- I'll call you after.

32:02.796 --> 32:04.856
What do you mean
Astrid was followed?

32:04.981 --> 32:07.981
Just get in the car, Walter.
I'll tell you later.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.840
I want a search bow to stern. Clear
the lower decks. Find these people.

32:33.965 --> 32:35.365
You three with me.

32:44.801 --> 32:46.151
<i>Upper deck clear.</i>

32:48.313 --> 32:49.713
<i>Main deck's clear.</i>

32:50.971 --> 32:52.321
<i>Top deck's clear.</i>

32:52.839 --> 32:53.839
<i>Copy.</i>

33:39.250 --> 33:41.685
There are no trafficked people
on this ship.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.053
But they were.

33:43.419 --> 33:44.919
We're just too late.

33:57.748 --> 33:59.498
{PUB}Why are we stopping here?

34:00.151 --> 34:01.465
Is this the place?

34:01.590 --> 34:04.090
Yes, but I need
to get back to the lab.

34:04.423 --> 34:06.585
I need to check on Agent Farnsworth.

34:09.295 --> 34:10.996
She's all right, Walter.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.313
We had the right vessel
but they were already gone.

34:26.481 --> 34:29.514
I know. They're here. <i>I just saw
them get unloaded through the alley.</i>

34:29.639 --> 34:31.690
- Where are you?
- We're at a Chinese herbalist

34:31.815 --> 34:34.737
shop Ping-On street. Astrid was
followed back to the lab from here.

34:34.976 --> 34:36.326
We're on our way.

34:41.281 --> 34:44.208
I need you to stay here.
Olivia and Broyles are on their way.

34:45.902 --> 34:47.853
This is not a good idea, son.

34:48.456 --> 34:49.755
I'll be careful.

34:55.204 --> 34:56.504
Stay in the car.

36:35.156 --> 36:36.706
Goes to all the shows

36:38.903 --> 36:41.003
Steps right in to the lions' den

36:41.739 --> 36:43.539
And tell them all he knows

36:46.449 --> 36:48.499
Puts his head in the lions' den

37:05.007 --> 37:07.007
Someone must know you're here.

37:08.021 --> 37:09.351
They coming soon?

37:10.940 --> 37:12.790
Nobody else knows I'm here.

37:14.714 --> 37:17.664
- Somehow I don't believe you.
- That's a shame.

37:17.789 --> 37:19.778
Most people find me
very trustworthy.

37:32.093 --> 37:33.623
Open. Open.

37:34.056 --> 37:36.956
Now, if you try to chew this,
it will kill you.

37:47.228 --> 37:48.228
Swallow!

37:56.816 --> 37:59.234
- Hands where I can see them!
- Gun!

38:02.046 --> 38:03.822
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

38:07.069 --> 38:08.219
Are you okay?

38:10.788 --> 38:11.788
I am now.

38:29.372 --> 38:30.757
Thought I lost you.

38:31.094 --> 38:32.768
Don't worry about this place.

38:33.918 --> 38:37.022
I'm gonna clean this up.

38:37.597 --> 38:39.547
Peter said you were followed.

38:51.255 --> 38:52.405
I'm so sorry.

38:54.748 --> 38:55.948
I didn't know.

38:57.977 --> 38:59.477
It's not your fault.

39:15.181 --> 39:17.187
What's the status
of the Chinese nationals?

39:17.355 --> 39:20.349
Well, some are still in surgery.
The rest in the ICU.

39:20.474 --> 39:21.974
Only time will tell.

39:22.099 --> 39:25.828
The doctor says it's a good prognosis
for Mai Lin's daughter and husband.

39:25.953 --> 39:27.853
What's gonna happen to them?

39:27.978 --> 39:31.391
The state department has agreed
to grant them all political asylum.

39:31.594 --> 39:33.857
With all those people
carrying Ming Che's medicine,

39:33.982 --> 39:36.331
he must've been treating
other people like Matt Jarvis.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.646
We turned up more
financial records at his shop

39:38.771 --> 39:41.418
that trace back to six other
patients with immune deficiency.

39:41.543 --> 39:44.453
- They're being questioned now.
- Did we find anything else in his shop

39:44.578 --> 39:47.231
- that could lead us to Jon Su?
- What we found

39:47.356 --> 39:48.927
is that there is no Jon Su.

39:49.350 --> 39:53.348
He's an alias used as a front for
all of Ming Che's financial dealings.

39:53.917 --> 39:55.069
Good work, you two.

39:55.194 --> 39:57.352
There's something I need
to take care of.

39:57.860 --> 39:58.860
Scuse me.

40:41.414 --> 40:43.114
What time is it, Walter?

40:43.239 --> 40:46.710
I want so badly
to be independent again.

40:47.865 --> 40:50.857
To live like a man, not a child.

40:51.874 --> 40:53.583
Not to have my son

40:54.482 --> 40:56.532
watching after me all the time.

40:57.734 --> 41:00.834
Not that I don't appreciate
all that you do for me.

41:02.785 --> 41:04.753
That's not the way
it's supposed to be.

41:05.441 --> 41:06.463
Let me finish.

41:08.542 --> 41:12.270
I've been out of the institution
for a year now.

41:13.397 --> 41:16.149
And I've just begun my journey

41:16.274 --> 41:18.024
back towards being whole.

41:19.410 --> 41:20.410
But...

41:21.370 --> 41:24.420
I fear there are still times
when I will get lost.

41:28.403 --> 41:29.403
So I have

41:30.469 --> 41:32.969
implanted a tracking device
in my neck.

41:33.606 --> 41:34.756
You did what?

41:41.283 --> 41:43.133
And here is the transponder

41:44.644 --> 41:46.094
So you can find me.

41:52.044 --> 41:54.294
I should let you get back to sleep.

42:02.955 --> 42:04.405
Good night, Walter.

42:07.516 --> 42:08.966
Good night, my son.
