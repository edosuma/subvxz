WEBVTT

01:19.204 --> 01:23.958
<i>I made Grace galbitang last night,</i>
<i>but I didn't get to finish it.</i>

01:24.042 --> 01:25.168
Do you need help?

01:25.251 --> 01:28.171
<i>I'm going to serve it to her</i>
<i>for breakfast.</i>

01:28.755 --> 01:30.924
I don't love American breakfast too much.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.260
Although I love
bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches.

01:34.344 --> 01:38.640
I just think that Asian cultures
have better breakfasts, so...

01:40.016 --> 01:41.518
Everyone's like, "Oh, you must cook
for people all the time."

01:41.601 --> 01:43.812
I was like, "No."

01:44.395 --> 01:46.022
You gotta set your bar low.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.235
I mean, if you cook for someone
right off the bat, you're fucked.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.072
Then they expect it all the time.

01:57.742 --> 02:00.203
So, honestly, this is stuff
I grew up eating.

02:01.454 --> 02:06.209
My mom would make bokkeumbap
or fried rice in the morning a lot.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.962
And there was always leftover stew.

02:09.045 --> 02:13.007
Yeah, I was about the same.
A lot of rice. More bantan.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.177
All these small
little Korean dishes.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.806
Eggs... I grew up eating
a lot of egg in my house, actually.

02:20.682 --> 02:24.018
Like, home cooking is this.
I don't need to get another utensil

02:24.561 --> 02:26.396
because I don't want to
fucking wash the dishes.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.066
Oh, hey, Seve.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.277
<i>I used to make Seve's food from scratch.</i>

02:32.360 --> 02:36.781
I used to buy organic beef, liver,
and we wouldn't...

02:36.865 --> 02:39.951
I wouldn't even cook for us,
but I cooked for him.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.162
This fucking asshole would never eat it.

02:44.956 --> 02:49.002
Now that I have a home kitchen
and I cook way more than I ever did,

02:49.085 --> 02:51.462
I tend to gravitate
towards simpler things,

02:51.546 --> 02:55.008
which I think is the normal trajectory
for a chef.

02:55.758 --> 02:59.762
This is literally how we...
She sits down, I stand up.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.267
This is food that I actually make at home

03:04.350 --> 03:07.061
and food that I now want to make
in a restaurant,

03:07.145 --> 03:09.939
which is a strange thing.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.860
<i>This is something that I would never</i>
<i>have served in a restaurant before.</i>

03:13.943 --> 03:14.986
<i>Looks like jail food.</i>

03:15.570 --> 03:18.448
It's pretty, I think.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.455
The biggest influence growing up
was my grandmother,

03:25.538 --> 03:28.041
or my "nan" as we say in England.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.252
I remember her doing
lots of Sunday roasts.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.588
<i>Lots of roasted vegetables, actually.</i>

03:33.671 --> 03:38.134
I kind of joke that my plate
used to look like the scene

03:38.218 --> 03:40.094
<i>from </i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind,

03:40.178 --> 03:43.598
where he used to build the potatoes up
that looked like the mountain.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.353
<i>My mom,</i>
<i>one of her specialties was corned beef</i>

03:48.436 --> 03:52.732
that was brined in the bag
and then boiled for hours.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.192
So that was her thing.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.819
It was like this corned beef,
but that was it.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.615
I didn't really have anyone
that was a stellar cook in my life.

04:01.616 --> 04:05.370
It was a time where three generations
were still living under one roof.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.956
The grandparents, the parents, the kids.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.708
So it was like, 25 people for lunch,
20 for dinner.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.211
<i>It was like a mini restaurant.</i>

04:13.294 --> 04:15.004
<i>My bedroom was right above the kitchen,</i>

04:15.088 --> 04:18.132
so I could smell the cabbage, the pork,
whatever was cooking.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.927
Maybe that's how
I went to the business. I don't know.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.011
When you're a younger cook,

04:22.095 --> 04:26.724
you want to learn ideas that have
nothing to do with what you grew up in.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.728
And I had wanted nothing to do
with Korean food,

04:30.812 --> 04:33.815
I wanted nothing to do
with anything of my upbringing.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.942
And then, things come full circle, right?

04:44.409 --> 04:48.413
<i>We're here at 163 First Avenue.</i>
<i>This was the original Momofuku Noodle Bar.</i>

04:48.496 --> 04:52.208
This is the lease I signed in 2004.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.627
<i>I was 26 years old.</i>

04:55.586 --> 04:57.672
So, the only reason this was successful

04:57.755 --> 04:59.507
was because we were supposed to
go out of business.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.926
So we threw out the rule book
of what was supposed to happen,

05:02.010 --> 05:05.763
<i>what was going to be a noodle bar. </i>
<i>No one knew what a noodle bar was.</i>

05:05.847 --> 05:10.768
And we started to literally cook things
that we were not supposed to cook.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.520
<i>We started to change the idea</i>

05:12.603 --> 05:15.481
<i>of what an authentic noodle bar </i>
<i>was supposed to be. </i>

05:15.565 --> 05:17.400
Next thing you know,
we got reviewed by Peter Meehan.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.111
<i>That was a game changer for us.</i>

05:21.612 --> 05:25.908
<i>I wrote the first review </i>
<i>of Momofuku Noodle Bar.</i>

05:25.992 --> 05:28.828
And... I hated it when it opened,

05:28.911 --> 05:31.914
and then nine months later,
it was great and wrote this review.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.334
And then I started going, like,
every Saturday.

05:34.417 --> 05:38.546
<i>Some months later, we were at the same </i>
<i>concert and he came up to me with a beer. </i>

05:38.629 --> 05:40.840
<i>At that point, I knew </i>
<i>I could choose writing about Dave</i>

05:40.923 --> 05:43.801
<i>or being buddies </i>
<i>with the guy that had the beer.</i>

05:43.885 --> 05:46.471
I took the beer
and we started hanging out.

05:46.554 --> 05:50.516
<i>We wrote a book together, </i>
<i>we started </i>Lucky Peach<i> magazine. </i>

05:50.600 --> 05:52.518
<i>I wanted to do the cookbook with Dave</i>

05:52.602 --> 05:56.105
<i>because I wanted to know how to make</i>
<i>the food that he was serving at the time.</i>

05:56.189 --> 05:58.232
It was just that delicious.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.861
<i>I'm like, "If I could cook that food </i>
<i>at home, I'd be happy."</i>

06:01.944 --> 06:05.490
Now we're just an old married couple,
doesn't talk that much.

06:12.246 --> 06:15.958
-I have no idea.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.669
-My mom is gonna cook the Korean stuff.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.254
Your mom's gonna cook the Korean stuff?

06:20.338 --> 06:21.547
Are you gonna cook the white people stuff?

06:21.631 --> 06:25.384
Yeah. I'll show you white people
how to do it better.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.805
-You're going to reach deep down inside.
-Yeah, yeah.

06:28.888 --> 06:33.518
To that golfing part inside of you
and just pull out the whiteness?

06:33.601 --> 06:37.939
I'm gonna bring out the biggest bitch
of Betty Crocker you've ever fucking seen.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.775
Did you always have
traditionally Thanksgiving?

06:40.858 --> 06:46.823
Growing up, our Thanksgivings were
maybe the highlight of the year.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.033
We would wind up having
this massive spread

06:49.117 --> 06:54.455
of American white food
and very, very authentic Korean food.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.626
When I first started cooking,

06:58.709 --> 07:00.419
I just remember the first couple of years

07:00.503 --> 07:04.173
I would make the most insane
Thanksgiving dinners.

07:05.216 --> 07:10.221
And I would cook for two straight days
and I didn't even think twice about it.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.223
Listen. When you're starting out
as a cook,

07:12.306 --> 07:14.725
you don't have any freedom of expression.
Right?

07:14.809 --> 07:17.061
The only freedom you have is like,
in family meals...

07:17.145 --> 07:18.938
-Right.
-Or like...

07:19.021 --> 07:20.606
You get to make an appetizer... You know, I'm like, working garde-manger.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.986
It's like, "Oh, my God, I get to
roast something that's not..."

07:25.069 --> 07:26.028
You get to touch hot food.

07:26.112 --> 07:31.075
Yeah. So I just make this insane spread.
Of course I brought my knives down.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.162
It was like I was making food
for the king of France or something.

07:34.245 --> 07:39.500
I did a butternut squash,
a black trumpet, capon, chestnut soup...

07:39.584 --> 07:41.335
I did all this crazy shit.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.295
I remember being like,

07:42.378 --> 07:46.132
"Wow. That was unnecessary labor.
Never gonna do that again."

07:46.215 --> 07:51.804
When I opened Momofuku in 2004, there was
like, no more cooking ever again.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.140
-Yeah. Too busy.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.101
For years, I missed Thanksgiving
because of work.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.659
<i>So, the first restaurant I opened up,</i>
<i>the original Noodle Bar, is 27 seats.</i>

08:13.743 --> 08:16.329
<i>This is around 200 plus.</i>

08:17.788 --> 08:20.666
<i>So this is a very big restaurant.</i>

08:24.712 --> 08:26.506
<i>I always admire certain chefs,</i>

08:26.589 --> 08:30.510
<i>chefs that are in Japan and whatnot,</i>
<i>that only have, like, one restaurant.</i>

08:31.886 --> 08:35.181
<i>I don't know, that just never happened.</i>
<i>I got...</i>

08:35.264 --> 08:37.767
I don't know how the hell it all happened.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.437
How you doing, chef?

08:42.980 --> 08:45.983
<i>Home cooking, </i>
<i>or what I call "ugly delicious" food,</i>

08:46.067 --> 08:49.487
<i>has now become the food </i>
<i>that I also wanna make in the restaurant.</i>

08:51.239 --> 08:54.200
<i>There's a way to coax some more</i>
<i>out of a dish.</i>

08:55.743 --> 08:58.621
I'm gonna make this braised cod dish
that we've been screwing around with.

08:58.704 --> 09:03.834
It's vaguely Portuguese, Korean,
but tastes Sichuan style.

09:07.922 --> 09:12.301
I just reached a point
where I'm okay making really ugly food.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.594
This is one of them.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.847
This is basically one of the ugliest
dishes I have ever made.

09:19.976 --> 09:24.272
I think it's a mixture of age and me
sort of coming into my own a little bit.

09:27.275 --> 09:31.946
<i>This is really just a peasant dish</i>
<i>of, like, peppers, potatoes and fish.</i>

09:32.029 --> 09:36.117
<i>If I cooked it with paprika, you could</i>
<i>almost say this is a Portuguese thing.</i>

09:36.200 --> 09:39.787
<i>If I added sausage, it would be</i>
<i>like sausage and peppers, right?</i>

09:39.870 --> 09:42.748
But I didn't, 'cause I think
it's important to have sweetness

09:42.832 --> 09:44.208
when you have something really hot.

09:44.292 --> 09:48.504
We have sweet potatoes in there
and carrots and mung bean noodles.

09:49.672 --> 09:53.426
So it's like,
"What the fuck are you eating?"

09:53.509 --> 09:54.969
You know what I mean?

09:55.553 --> 09:57.680
<i>If you try to respect these cultures,</i>

09:57.763 --> 10:00.683
you can figure out
how to merge them together

10:00.766 --> 10:03.311
without bastardizing any of it.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.063
<i>How do you construct a dish</i>
<i>where you can't see the seams?</i>

10:06.147 --> 10:08.524
<i>Visually, it happens</i>
<i>like in an Escher painting,</i>

10:08.608 --> 10:12.111
<i>where you don't know what's up or down,</i>
<i>where it begins or it ends.</i>

10:12.194 --> 10:14.905
<i>You can hear it in music, Bach's fugues...</i>

10:14.989 --> 10:18.492
<i>If you play it right, you can, </i>
<i>in theory, play it forever.</i>

10:19.619 --> 10:23.164
<i>The dishes that we're making </i>
<i>that have been successful...</i>

10:24.081 --> 10:28.502
<i>they just somehow made sense, right?</i>
<i>Even though they weren't supposed to.</i>

10:28.586 --> 10:29.795
<i>You know it's so delicious,</i>

10:29.879 --> 10:33.341
<i>but it's not the deliciousness</i>
<i>that makes it so memorable, </i>

10:34.133 --> 10:37.511
<i>it's something so delicious </i>
<i>that you associate it with a memory. </i>

10:37.595 --> 10:40.222
<i>That's what moves you </i>
<i>to another time in your life,</i>

10:40.306 --> 10:42.058
which is like that <i>Ratatouille</i> moment.

10:46.312 --> 10:50.608
I can't believe
I'm quoting a cartoon or... Fuck.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.486
But like, they trigger something.

10:53.569 --> 10:56.989
<i>When you eat a dish </i>
<i>that's not even like roast chicken, </i>

10:57.073 --> 11:00.993
but reminds you of a dish
of roast chicken cooked by your mom.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.538
<i>That's where you wanna be at in cooking.</i>

11:08.918 --> 11:10.211
Here's another thing.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.381
At least cooking at my mom's house,
there's no tools.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.841
Did you roll down with anything?
Did you bring knives?

11:15.925 --> 11:18.803
-No. God, no.
-I almost grabbed knives.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.179
I don't even know if the ovens work.

11:20.262 --> 11:24.642
The microwave doesn't work.
It looks relatively janky.

11:24.725 --> 11:28.604
Cool. We will go there tomorrow
and make Thanksgiving dinner.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.606
Yes, like pilgrims.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.983
-Regardless of the circumstances.
-Yes.

11:33.067 --> 11:37.238
Much like pilgrims,
we will get rid of the natural inhabitants

11:37.321 --> 11:38.864
and take it for ourselves.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.177
What do you wanna make for lunch?

12:00.261 --> 12:04.306
I did not think about
lunch. I don't want my son to suffer.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.393
Hey, Mom. Do you want
to put this in the galbi jjim?

12:07.476 --> 12:10.312
You don't put
rice cakes in galbi jjim, son.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.607
We'll see.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.610
-I'm gonna get some of these.
-That's too big.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.279
-Don't worry, Mom.
-I buy this one.

12:18.362 --> 12:19.530
No, Mom. We're good.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.283
-This way.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.373
David Chang, you like this?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.000
I don't. Unless you wanna bring it.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.044
David Chang.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.629
We almost done?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.633
No store likes this
in New York, right?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.511
Not like this.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.936
I'll grab the spoon from over here.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.771
I got it, I got it.

12:52.855 --> 12:53.814
This is crispy.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.566
Hey, Mom, I got it.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.986
I don't understand how come
you so cook very good.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.614
It's true. You never taught me
how to cook one thing.

13:01.697 --> 13:02.907
No. I didn't.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.658
Not one thing.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.203
In my house, he's the king.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.120
Here.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.163
He's the baby king.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.247
The baby king?
-Yeah.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.042
So we not teach you food.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.505
And it's not a pleasant term.
It's like I'm a spoiled brat.

13:19.965 --> 13:24.178
<i>I mean, honestly, all the recipes I make</i>
<i>today that are inspired by you,</i>

13:24.261 --> 13:26.555
<i>it's only 'cause I've seen you do it</i>
<i>a thousand times.</i>

13:26.639 --> 13:28.224
I made my first bindaetteok last year.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.142
Really?
-No recipe.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.270
<i>But I knew how to do it. </i>
<i>I remember all your tricks.</i>

13:33.812 --> 13:36.023
-7Up with a mul-naengmyeon.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.734
-That's right, yeah, that's true.
-Right. Right.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.903
It's a very sparkling taste.

13:41.529 --> 13:46.158
She used to make steaks
in the toaster oven.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.956
You used to put sirloins,
frozen from Giant

13:52.039 --> 13:53.624
and you'd cook 'em frozen.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.752
Frozen in the toaster oven.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.796
Ah, you remember too much.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.174
Okay.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.467
What are you doing
with the lobster?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.427
I was gonna make lunch.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.389
We're gonna go country style?
-Yeah.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.267
<i>-We're gonna have galbi jjim tonight.</i>
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

14:11.350 --> 14:15.896
And you would serve galbi jjim
for like, three weeks after. Right?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.148
<i>Till everything was consumed. </i>

14:18.857 --> 14:21.694
<i>So the first two days,</i>
<i>you could eat it on the bone.</i>

14:22.528 --> 14:24.113
<i>And then 72 hours, </i>

14:24.196 --> 14:27.324
-everything started to turn to mush.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.076
<i>But, all of a sudden,</i>

14:29.159 --> 14:32.913
<i>all the good pieces were gone</i>
<i>and then you'd only have the tendons.</i>

14:32.997 --> 14:36.125
You made me eat all the chewy stuff.

14:36.208 --> 14:40.045
I remember one day,
I had friends over from elementary school.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.590
<i>You had a two-week-old pot of galbi jjim.</i>

14:43.924 --> 14:45.759
-I remember this.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.888
<i>You made a pot of curry</i>
<i>and the curry smell was terrible.</i>

14:48.971 --> 14:50.180
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

14:50.264 --> 14:52.808
<i>I remember </i>
<i>looking at everyone's faces, </i>

14:52.892 --> 14:55.769
<i>-how horrified they were.</i>
<i>-Oh...</i>

14:55.853 --> 14:58.272
The next day,
everyone at school made fun of me.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.440
Really?
-Yeah.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.649
I'm sorry.
-Mom.

15:02.943 --> 15:03.819
Come on.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.404
<i>But you had no idea.</i>

15:05.487 --> 15:08.198
<i>To you, this was like</i>
<i>extraordinarily delicious food.</i>

15:08.282 --> 15:10.117
That was the cultural shock

15:10.200 --> 15:12.077
that was so hard
for you and Dad to understand.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.540
<i>And the funny thing is,</i>
<i>now that food is super cool,</i>

15:16.624 --> 15:18.083
<i>which is so weird.</i>

15:19.543 --> 15:20.794
Wow!

15:24.924 --> 15:29.136
-Wow, this is good lobster.
-Could have cooked the noodles more.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.849
Did he help when he was little?
Was he ever little?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.142
No.
-No.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.520
The person that I saw
cook the most was her mom.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.981
My earliest memories
are on my grandmother's back,

15:41.065 --> 15:44.485
while she's cooking over this...
She would just cook.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.278
And I would always be there.

15:46.362 --> 15:50.741
And I would spend weekends
at their retirement home

15:50.824 --> 15:53.077
and I'd always like spending time there.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.328
Hi.
-Please come in.

15:54.411 --> 15:57.498
Hi, guys.
Hi. Very handsome, yes.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.499
They're big.

15:58.582 --> 15:59.833
Looks delicious.
What's up, man?

15:59.917 --> 16:02.294
How you doing?
-Good.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.295
-Hey.
This is Peter.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.838
Very nice to meet you.
How's it going?

16:04.922 --> 16:06.298
<i>The funny thing for me is</i>

16:06.382 --> 16:08.717
when people think
I'm cooking all the time at home

16:08.801 --> 16:11.762
or that my boyfriend
has the best luck in the world

16:11.845 --> 16:13.806
of eating well every night.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.182
<i>Best case, on any day, </i>

16:15.265 --> 16:17.184
<i>you'll get some scrambled eggs</i>
<i>out of the deal,</i>

16:17.267 --> 16:19.228
or you'll get some late-night food
after work,

16:19.311 --> 16:22.481
but there's not a lot of time for us
to plan a meal

16:22.564 --> 16:24.650
<i>for even the people we love the most.</i>

16:24.733 --> 16:28.112
I used to cook for my husband a lot.
It was a gesture of true love.

16:28.195 --> 16:32.324
I mean, I feel bad that he doesn’t get
as much love anymore

16:32.408 --> 16:36.286
'cause I make stuff for my kids
or I prioritize other things,

16:36.370 --> 16:37.788
sometimes laundry.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.337
René<i> Redzepi is one of</i>
<i>the world's great chefs.</i>

16:45.421 --> 16:47.256
<i>He's one of my closest friends.</i>

16:47.339 --> 16:50.134
He's most well known, obviously,
for being the chef of Noma.

16:50.217 --> 16:53.137
<i>He's someone that's very significant </i>
<i>in the culinary world </i>

16:53.220 --> 16:57.224
<i>because he's the reason why people </i>
<i>eat Nordic food around the world.</i>

16:58.434 --> 17:00.144
<i>The most common thing you hear</i>

17:00.227 --> 17:02.688
<i>if you tell people </i>
<i>that you date a chef is that,</i>

17:02.771 --> 17:05.691
<i>"Oh, my God, </i>
<i>you must eat so well at home."</i>

17:05.774 --> 17:08.610
I mean, we do, but because I cook.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.988
But he's never here
when it's dinner time.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.076
<i>When I was pregnant </i>
<i>with our first daughter,</i>

17:16.160 --> 17:19.788
<i>I started writing down </i>
<i>my favorite recipes</i>

17:19.872 --> 17:24.376
because I always liked the idea
of having this family cookbook.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.046
Some of the recipes that René
would be able to pass down

17:27.129 --> 17:29.590
through the Noma cookbooks,

17:29.673 --> 17:31.425
you can't really make it
in a home kitchen.

17:32.009 --> 17:37.139
<i>So I created an Instagram account </i>
<i>and started posting dinner on there</i>

17:37.222 --> 17:39.391
<i>and was offered a book deal.</i>

17:40.559 --> 17:41.643
<i>It's called </i>Downtime.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.564
<i>It means that we're all gonna sit down</i>
<i>and be together and talk.</i>

17:46.857 --> 17:49.359
It's a big thing for us, dinner.

17:52.071 --> 17:56.492
I mean, I will say,
having René and Dave at once...

17:56.575 --> 18:00.079
And they're gonna be joking a lot.

18:00.162 --> 18:04.458
It's a little bit nerve-racking
but totally fine.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.422
<i>I remember when we had</i>
<i>David Chang over the first time.</i>

18:10.506 --> 18:12.007
<i>He was so happy about it.</i>

18:12.091 --> 18:13.926
He was like,
"We never do this in New York

18:14.009 --> 18:16.011
because nobody has kitchens big enough
to cook in.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.971
You always go out for dinner."

18:18.055 --> 18:20.974
Even though he doesn't cook a lot,

18:21.058 --> 18:24.228
he now enjoys just being able
to cook at home.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.479
-Yeah.
It is nice.

18:25.562 --> 18:29.525
I think increasingly, when people go out,
they want something more home cooking.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.485
Whereas maybe before, it was something...

18:31.568 --> 18:34.154
People wanted something
they don't get at home.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.072
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

18:35.155 --> 18:39.535
I feel like, at least at Noma,
a lot of the guests, deep down inside,

18:39.618 --> 18:42.287
they have a secret wish
that their next dish is a steak

18:42.371 --> 18:44.540
and that dessert is a brownie.
You know?

18:44.623 --> 18:47.459
That reminds me of when
I had my first Noma dinner.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.003
It reminded me of something
my mom used to make.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.715
It brought me back to that moment
and it was so homey

18:53.799 --> 18:55.968
and it was just, like, so unexpected.

18:56.051 --> 19:00.848
And I was like,
"This is bonkers. This is crazy."

19:00.931 --> 19:04.560
I had no idea
I could feel this way about food.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.561
Yeah.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.937
-Oh...
Hey.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.358
-Just sneaking in.
-Sneaking in.

19:11.441 --> 19:12.401
Are you guys gossiping?

19:14.319 --> 19:15.988
-No. She was.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.783
-I know where to get all the answers.
-No, she wasn't.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.243
I just have to talk to you.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.619
<i>We're talking about</i>

19:22.703 --> 19:25.539
<i>the differences between</i>
<i>restaurant cooking and home cooking.</i>

19:25.622 --> 19:26.999
<i>I mean, we talk about this a lot.</i>

19:27.082 --> 19:29.626
I think that so many things
that we do in restaurants

19:29.710 --> 19:32.296
can be replicated
by any other restaurant, right?

19:32.379 --> 19:35.090
<i>The thing that can separate</i>
<i>a restaurant experience</i>

19:35.174 --> 19:38.635
is literally how much someone
cares about making that food.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.181
Here, for home cooking,
Nadine just wants to make us so happy.

19:44.266 --> 19:48.020
It has less to do with perfection than,
I think, with intent.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.689
-Mmm-hmm.
-The intent is more perfect.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.862
<i>Have you ever used</i>
<i>the Noma cookbooks for home cooking?</i>

19:56.945 --> 19:58.989
No.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.742
Well, I mean...

20:01.825 --> 20:05.579
I loved cooking before I met René,
and when I met René, it was incredible.

20:05.662 --> 20:09.833
<i>I would call René and say,</i>
<i>"You know that thing that's on that dish,</i>

20:09.917 --> 20:11.793
can I do that at home"

20:13.212 --> 20:15.714
<i>So, very lucky in that way.</i>

20:25.098 --> 20:27.851
<i>So, this is a dish</i>
<i>from a restaurant.</i>

20:27.935 --> 20:31.980
<i>When my mom wasn't cooking</i>
<i>or if I wasn't playing golf or something,</i>

20:32.064 --> 20:34.733
<i>we'd go to this restaurant</i>
<i>called Wu's Garden.</i>

20:34.816 --> 20:36.068
<i>Family restaurant.</i>

20:36.568 --> 20:37.402
<i>Once a week...</i>

20:37.486 --> 20:41.907
<i>Yeah. So this restaurant,</i>
<i>it was owned by Chinese immigrants</i>

20:41.990 --> 20:44.493
<i>that were cooks</i>
<i>in the Shandong province of China.</i>

20:44.576 --> 20:48.914
<i>So they cooked with</i>
<i>a lot of garlic and scallions,</i>

20:48.997 --> 20:53.210
and most people assumed it was just
sort of a Chinese-American restaurant.

20:53.293 --> 20:57.256
But my dad and the owner were friends
and it looked Chinese-American,

20:57.339 --> 21:01.260
<i>but the dishes that we ordered</i>
<i>were always Shandong style.</i>

21:01.343 --> 21:02.511
One more plate?

21:02.594 --> 21:06.640
We'd always get this braised tofu
which is cooked very similar to this dish

21:06.723 --> 21:08.392
which is braised boneless chicken

21:08.475 --> 21:12.771
which was dark meat that was marinated
in Shaoxing wine and a little soy,

21:12.854 --> 21:16.066
and then they would bread it
and then dip it in egg,

21:16.149 --> 21:18.360
<i>which was a very different thing.</i>

21:18.443 --> 21:22.072
<i>I thought it was the greatest dish,</i>
<i>growing up.</i>

21:22.155 --> 21:26.618
<i>I loved that restaurant so much</i>
<i>and I was very sad when it closed.</i>

21:26.702 --> 21:28.537
<i>We were there for the last day</i>

21:29.329 --> 21:33.125
and, like many Chinese immigrant families
that open up restaurants,

21:33.208 --> 21:36.211
they worked hard so their kids
wouldn't do the restaurant business

21:36.295 --> 21:39.214
and I asked them
for, basically, the recipe

21:39.840 --> 21:42.843
and they gave it to me.
And I was very happy.

21:42.926 --> 21:45.304
Your dad worked hard so you wouldn't
end up in the restaurant business

21:45.387 --> 21:47.389
-Yeah.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.851
Nice job, Pete.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.894
How much japchae
is your mom gonna make?

21:52.978 --> 21:54.771
A lot. You have no idea.

21:54.855 --> 21:58.734
I always make a lot so I can make it
some more food.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.945
Anyway, you the good helper.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.864
How about Dave?
Is he a good helper?

22:03.947 --> 22:07.701
I told you, he's a king!

22:09.202 --> 22:12.080
Mom, you know how many jokes
are gonna be made of me now?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.999
-I mean, it's really--
-Thank you.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.126
I'm just trying to get
as much out of that well as I can.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.089
Mom?
Yes.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.509
Look. Just like Wu's Gardens.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.442
<i>I was pretty adrift</i>
<i>when I moved to New York.</i>

22:40.525 --> 22:43.153
Like, I didn't know
what I was doing with my life.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.866
<i>My wife and I started cooking</i>
<i>and eating more expansively,</i>

22:47.949 --> 22:49.159
<i>and lived above a used bookstore,</i>

22:49.242 --> 22:53.080
and I started buying cookbooks
and just reading them, like...

22:53.163 --> 22:56.124
You know, for $8, go downstairs,
buy another book.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.710
As I watched all of my friends studying

22:58.794 --> 23:01.588
to become doctors and lawyers
and Indian chiefs,

23:01.671 --> 23:03.423
I was like, "I gotta pick a thing."

23:03.507 --> 23:05.258
And I'm like,
"I'm gonna make food my thing."

23:10.806 --> 23:12.516
<i>All these dead people. Jesus!</i>

23:13.767 --> 23:16.478
<i>This guy's got a lot of books</i>
<i>by dead people.</i>

23:16.561 --> 23:19.439
<i>There's more of them</i>
<i>than there are of us.</i>

23:19.523 --> 23:21.441
I used to come up
to this section a lot,

23:21.525 --> 23:25.445
which I imagine you would have
nothing but bad things to say about.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.531
Nothing but scorn for the...

23:27.614 --> 23:30.033
The fancy international
chef community books On the other hand...

23:32.619 --> 23:34.204
Wait, that's you.
-I love this section.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.540
As we pan down
to the Mark Bittman section.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.418
You know, when I was asked
to write <i>How to Cook Everything,</i>

23:40.502 --> 23:42.921
I was asked to write
the new <i>Joy of Cooking.</i>

23:43.004 --> 23:44.464
So I thought, "Okay. I'm gonna write

23:44.548 --> 23:47.217
the most basic cookbook
I know how to write."

23:47.300 --> 23:51.805
The other thing is for 13 years I had
that weekly deadline of "The Minimalist."

23:51.888 --> 23:55.976
<i>And that was supposed</i>
<i>to be short, fast, easy, simple.</i>

23:56.059 --> 23:59.187
<i>I can't do anything complicated now.</i>
<i>I won't.</i>

23:59.271 --> 24:01.982
<i>I feel like I did</i>
<i>that </i>Momofuku<i> book with Dave.</i> <i>I was really into all that shit</i>
<i>like boning a pig's head</i>

24:04.860 --> 24:07.612
<i>and making torchons</i>
<i>and freezing foie gras,</i>

24:07.696 --> 24:09.948
and doing that all at home and then...

24:10.031 --> 24:12.284
Actually a friend, him and his girlfriend
got pregnant,

24:12.367 --> 24:14.202
and he was like,
"I need to know how to fucking cook.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.287
-I don't know how to cook."
-Right.

24:15.370 --> 24:18.790
I bought him Marcella Hazan,
<i>The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking.</i>

24:18.874 --> 24:20.167
<i>I'm like,</i>
<i>"This book will take care of you."</i>

24:20.250 --> 24:25.172
And he kind of became the guy that
I started writing home cooking books for.

24:25.255 --> 24:28.133
And I think that having a person in mind
for it was always good.

24:28.216 --> 24:32.888
<i>But still, you try to test recipes</i>
<i>and you try to make them foolproof</i>

24:32.971 --> 24:36.141
and you cook them a couple of times
and then you send a book to somebody,

24:36.224 --> 24:37.767
and they're like, "This was salty."

24:37.851 --> 24:39.936
And you're like,
"Fuck you! That wasn't salty."

24:40.020 --> 24:42.898
And then you make it
and you're like, "That was salty."

24:42.981 --> 24:46.610
That's why I'll never do a recipe
that doesn't say salt to taste.

24:46.693 --> 24:49.529
<i>It's like the gym teaching</i>
<i>of writing, but it's still writing.</i>

24:49.613 --> 24:53.825
It's like the computer manual of writing.
It's an instruction manual.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.369
One of Jacques Pépin's best lines was,

24:56.453 --> 25:01.333
"Recipes are like rivers, they're never
the same from one moment to the next."

25:01.416 --> 25:03.293
You never cook the same recipe twice.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.217
When I started cooking,

25:10.300 --> 25:13.470
I thought the only food that was
worth exploring and learning

25:13.553 --> 25:18.350
<i>and working hard to be proficient at</i>
<i>was high-end French dining.</i>

25:18.934 --> 25:22.312
<i>And that's sort of where I see food at </i>
<i>right now in food television,</i>

25:22.395 --> 25:26.107
that everything has to be
this super glossy affair.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.694
<i>When in reality, good food is everywhere.</i>

25:29.778 --> 25:31.821
<i>And it's not just</i>
<i>one person's perspective.</i>

25:34.741 --> 25:38.203
Not yet, chef.

25:38.286 --> 25:41.289
-Tired of tasting it, I'll bet.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.876
<i>It's more than cooking, it's...</i>

25:44.960 --> 25:47.879
<i>You care enough where you want</i>
<i>someone to leave the restaurant</i>

25:47.963 --> 25:50.382
feeling that they got value
and they loved it here.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.008
<i>That's so important.</i>

25:52.092 --> 25:55.470
<i>-To me, that is home cooking.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:55.553 --> 25:58.014
<i>And I think why home cooking</i>
<i>is so delicious,</i>

25:58.098 --> 25:59.891
<i>why what Nadine is cooking</i>
<i>is so delicious,</i>

25:59.975 --> 26:04.020
because she cares about it,
even if it doesn't taste great.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.022
-It's still okay.

26:06.106 --> 26:08.233
-It's still great.
Okay, David.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.945
I didn't mean it like that.
I said, "Hypothetically speaking."

26:12.028 --> 26:14.572
I didn't put quotation marks.

26:15.365 --> 26:18.576
<i>I've always felt what made</i>
<i>Noma and you so special</i>

26:18.660 --> 26:21.329
<i>is you get people to buy into caring.</i>

26:22.163 --> 26:23.999
I only have that place.

26:27.252 --> 26:32.007
Imagine you only had Ko and Ssäm Bar.
Just imagine, dude.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.718
I imagine it all the time.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.929
Part of the reason we're growing and part
of the reason you're growing, too,

26:38.013 --> 26:40.432
-is to take care of the people around you.
-Mmm-hmm.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.268
<i>Yeah, that's true.</i>

26:46.271 --> 26:48.023
Isn't that so...

26:48.857 --> 26:51.276
Oh, this looks amazing.

26:53.486 --> 26:56.906
-Well, thank you for all the home cooking.
-Oh, you're so welcome.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.743
Thank you, Ro,
for giving me the stink eye.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.121
When you work in a restaurant,

27:03.204 --> 27:09.294
you kind of end up
having your team be your family,

27:10.670 --> 27:13.214
'cause that's where
you spend so much time.

27:13.298 --> 27:18.887
I don't know what it is. It's become like
work, hobby, private life.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.473
-The place where everyone knows your name.

27:21.556 --> 27:24.225
-It's our pub. It's our local pub.
It really is.

27:24.309 --> 27:28.438
-And the wine's for free.
I know!

27:28.521 --> 27:30.273
That's why I go.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.442
Mmm. That is so good, these ones.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.818
Very good.

27:33.902 --> 27:38.239
When I met René,
he made such a big deal about telling me,

27:38.323 --> 27:40.450
warning me what I was getting into,

27:40.533 --> 27:43.495
at one point, I was like,
"Is he trying to get rid of me

27:44.496 --> 27:48.458
But he'd just seen
several relationships fail.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.001
I actually remember, I said,

27:50.085 --> 27:52.670
"What you're experiencing right now
is the best it's ever gonna get."

27:53.380 --> 27:57.592
-He said something like that to me, too!
We were spending a lot of time.

27:57.675 --> 28:02.097
I didn't have to be on the road.
I could be home by, like, 8 o'clock.

28:02.180 --> 28:07.060
I remember telling her after three months
of dating, "This isn't real."

28:07.143 --> 28:10.230
-Chef, wait till you have kids, too.

28:10.313 --> 28:13.983
Because kids don't care.
They don't care how tired you are.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.694
Or how much you need
to sleep or whatever.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.447
They need to be changed.
They need to wake up.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.615
I don't know
how the hell you did it.

28:20.698 --> 28:24.119
That's, to me, one of
the most amazing achievements.

28:24.202 --> 28:28.873
I don't know how I could have run Noma
and done what I've done

28:28.957 --> 28:32.085
without having the sanity
of a family and kids.

28:33.336 --> 28:36.297
-Yeah, you're three behind, buddy.

28:38.925 --> 28:44.264
Having a child really changed the way
that I cook, shop, and personally eat

28:44.347 --> 28:47.600
because now, you know, it feels like
there's a responsibility

28:47.684 --> 28:49.811
<i>to teach him where food comes from.</i>

28:49.894 --> 28:52.981
<i>It doesn't come from a bag</i>
<i>or a factory or a can.</i>

28:54.315 --> 28:58.987
My son doesn't eat very many foods.
My son likes to eat breakfast bars.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.406
<i>I mean, I've tried to get him</i>
<i>to try stuff.</i>

29:01.489 --> 29:04.993
He'll be in tears and say,
"I don't think I can handle it."

29:05.076 --> 29:08.496
<i>Which is so weird for me,</i>
<i>to embrace food so easily</i>

29:08.580 --> 29:10.582
<i>and then to feel sad for him</i>
<i>to reject it.</i>

29:10.665 --> 29:15.462
He really can't handle it.
And then my daughter loves everything.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.634
You have to do it with chopsticks.

29:21.718 --> 29:22.761
It's okay, Mom.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.345
You have to fry it in frying oil.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.681
I know.
I know what I'm... I'm just...

29:27.474 --> 29:32.187
So this recipe, this is the highlight
of any Chang Thanksgiving.

29:32.270 --> 29:37.776
Oily shrimp rolls, we just minced it
with some ginger, garlic.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.111
Put prune juice, courtesy of our mom.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.529
Don't put in the prune juice.

29:41.613 --> 29:45.158
Onions. Easy, peanut gallery.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.871
It's not gluten free.
It's not MSG free.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.456
Not MSG free.

29:51.539 --> 29:55.084
And I think you should use some
of the farce to seal it, too.

29:55.877 --> 30:00.423
Pete, this is like
the fucking <i>Mona Lisa</i> right here.

30:00.507 --> 30:03.051
This is the most sensible version
of shrimp toast, I think.

30:03.134 --> 30:04.427
That's why the Irish--

30:04.511 --> 30:06.513
It's almost a refined version
of shrimp toast

30:06.596 --> 30:08.223
in the way that something that involves--

30:08.306 --> 30:11.100
That's why your culture
has such great cuisine.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.103
You guys always go the extra mile.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.397
I don't know how you're insulting me,

30:16.481 --> 30:18.483
-but I feel like you're insulting me.
-100%.

30:18.566 --> 30:21.069
The entire country of Ireland
has ruined my thesis

30:21.152 --> 30:24.322
of "tragedy and famine
produces great food."

30:24.906 --> 30:27.200
You know,
an exception proves a rule, right?

30:27.283 --> 30:30.829
No. Look at how fucking nice this is.

30:30.912 --> 30:35.750
That's why I love cooking.
You start out making shit like that.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.796
And progress in five minutes.
It's awesome.

30:40.588 --> 30:43.049
<i>There's something wrong</i>
<i>about serving this in a restaurant.</i>

30:43.132 --> 30:45.218
<i>This is not restaurant food.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

30:45.301 --> 30:47.303
These are not good for you.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.266
I eat the crappiest food.

30:51.349 --> 30:55.061
You know? Like, I'm gonna die of diabetes,
I think, or from...

30:55.144 --> 30:57.605
My weakness is potato chips.

30:57.689 --> 31:01.067
<i>The dirty little secret that you'll find</i>
<i>with a lot of chefs </i>

31:01.150 --> 31:03.069
<i>is that our fridges </i>
<i>don't have a lot in them.</i>

31:03.152 --> 31:08.241
I am making popcorn at least
two to three times a week at home,

31:08.324 --> 31:10.660
and kind of saying that
that is dinner.

31:10.743 --> 31:13.705
I always went to sleep
with a piece of chocolate in my mouth.

31:13.788 --> 31:16.416
I wake up in the morning,
I have sweet dreams. Nice.

31:16.499 --> 31:17.625
55 years later,

31:17.709 --> 31:22.130
I'm still having my piece of chocolate
after I brush my teeth. Every night.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.139
Have you ever made knish dough before?

31:31.222 --> 31:32.807
I have never made a knish before.

31:35.184 --> 31:37.896
Ooh. You have a different technique
than me. That's good technique.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.981
I think yours is better than mine.

31:40.064 --> 31:40.899
Nah.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.944
I can't believe I'm teaching you
how to make something. This is very funny.

31:45.028 --> 31:48.448
Okay. So now we're just gonna stretch.

31:48.531 --> 31:52.827
I love that we're gonna make
cochinita pibil knishes.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.246
This idea could go viral.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.958
Yeah. I wonder what the rabbi
is gonna think about it though.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.339
-Sacrilicious.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.466
Sacrilicious. That's it.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.885
So, first time I made these for my mother,

32:08.968 --> 32:13.389
she's like, "Oh, my God.
It actually looks like a knish."

32:13.473 --> 32:16.643
Did you say something like, "Mom,
I've been a professional chef since..."

32:16.726 --> 32:19.646
No, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

32:20.563 --> 32:23.608
Okay, this is going to be epic.

32:23.691 --> 32:27.278
Don't you think it's hilarious
that we both have really crap kitchens?

32:27.362 --> 32:30.365
You do with the stoves that you're given.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.576
Yeah. And the countertops or lack thereof

32:33.660 --> 32:37.246
and I think the more you know how to cook,
the more adaptable you are.

32:37.330 --> 32:43.002
Probably. I mean, my favorite kitchen ever
was actually smaller than this area here.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.880
Then the oven was, like,
an O'Keefe and Merritt.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.674
My mother kept warning me
that it didn't fit a turkey,

32:47.757 --> 32:50.843
and in fact, it would only fit
a nine-pound turkey.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.972
-Well, this oven here.
-Yeah, there you go.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.516
That was my oven for 20 years.

32:56.599 --> 33:00.103
A Facebook friend I've never met
gave me this oven.

33:00.186 --> 33:03.564
Gave me this stove
because she felt so sorry for me.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.776
Okay, that, Jonathan,

33:07.944 --> 33:10.989
you should get another Pulitzer Prize
just for that.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.241
Those smell better than any knishes

33:13.324 --> 33:16.995
-I've ever smelt before!
-Oh, my God. These smell so good.

33:18.454 --> 33:19.872
So good.

33:19.956 --> 33:20.915
That is so good.

33:26.504 --> 33:30.425
I don't know that we have ever cooked
alongside of each other.

33:31.426 --> 33:34.679
We've cooked together,
but not like this. Extended.

33:34.762 --> 33:36.305
It's a day long.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.517
It's like, I'm very surprised

33:39.600 --> 33:45.314
that you've contained your rage
over messiness, knife skills.

33:45.398 --> 33:48.192
-It is what it is.
-That looks good.

33:48.276 --> 33:51.154
I'm sick and tired
of being sick and tired, Peter.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.407
May I?

34:05.043 --> 34:08.004
<i>I've watched Dave become </i>

34:08.087 --> 34:12.383
<i>nationally and internationally famous </i>
<i>and open tons of businesses.</i>

34:13.718 --> 34:20.058
The amount of private life I think he
even has time for is so small in New York

34:20.141 --> 34:25.146
<i>so it's always funny to see somebody </i>
<i>have to cook in their socks </i>

34:25.229 --> 34:28.566
<i>and take shit from their mom.</i>
<i>You know? Like, I don't know...</i>

34:28.649 --> 34:31.277
That's a fun thing to see.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.200
So much pain.

34:37.283 --> 34:40.745
So much fucking pain
for this stupid fucking dish.

34:41.954 --> 34:46.042
<i>Well, I think the amount</i>
<i>of extra cooking for Thanksgiving </i>

34:46.125 --> 34:51.047
is part cooking to fill the hours
that otherwise could be filled

34:51.130 --> 34:53.091
with emotional connection
with your family members.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.175
What's happening?

34:54.258 --> 34:57.970
-Good, thank you.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.263
So...

35:01.849 --> 35:05.103
He's just got a little PTSD
about these mashed potatoes,

35:05.186 --> 35:07.814
but this too shall pass. Yeah.

35:08.773 --> 35:12.026
<i>To work with somebody for so long, </i>

35:12.110 --> 35:14.445
<i>you start to know </i>
<i>what they're gonna anticipate.</i>

35:14.529 --> 35:16.906
<i>And I can do a lot of that for Dave,</i>

35:16.989 --> 35:20.034
and Dave knows a lot
of what makes me tick.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.037
So it's a, I don't know, it's a...

35:23.121 --> 35:25.957
It's the longest, most intimate
male relationship

35:26.040 --> 35:28.709
I've ever been involved in, so...

35:29.460 --> 35:31.963
These are awesome, Pete.
You did a fucking awesome job.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.422
Thank you.

35:33.506 --> 35:34.799
I think that's the most
genuinely nice thing

35:34.882 --> 35:39.345
you've ever said to me
in our decade of working together.

35:39.428 --> 35:41.556
-I'm gonna take it to heart.
-It's Thanksgiving.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.225
-Don't take it for granted. Get ready. They're here.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.032
<i>When </i>Babette's Feast<i> came out,</i>
<i>I was...</i>

36:00.950 --> 36:03.202
It changed my life, you know?

36:04.620 --> 36:10.793
<i>I loved the idea of Babette </i>
<i>blowing all her money on one night,</i>

36:11.502 --> 36:13.421
<i>and it was profound for me,</i>

36:13.504 --> 36:18.092
<i>'cause, as a refugee, </i>
<i>you're always scrimping and saving and...</i>

36:18.176 --> 36:21.429
And you would never do something
so frivolous, in a way, you know?

36:21.512 --> 36:26.642
So, I saved all my money
and I wanted to have one feast, you know?

36:26.726 --> 36:28.603
And one feast for, like,
a 16-year-old kid.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.521
<i>It was momentous for me. </i>

36:30.605 --> 36:32.398
<i>And I opened up the fridge</i>

36:32.481 --> 36:37.278
and I saw my meringue strawberry thing

36:37.361 --> 36:39.655
just oozing, you know? Like, quivering.

36:39.739 --> 36:41.782
<i>And then just my Grandma </i>
<i>right here, going,</i>

36:41.866 --> 36:45.244
"It looks like dog shit.
I would not serve that."

36:45.328 --> 36:48.206
I was like, "Oh, lady."

36:48.289 --> 36:52.168
<i>So I carry that </i>
<i>every time I put up a new dish.</i>

36:52.251 --> 36:56.047
I would have that experience again, this,

36:56.130 --> 36:58.382
"It just looks like shit.
I just shouldn't do it."

37:08.017 --> 37:10.019
You want herbs?
Yeah, I got it.

37:10.853 --> 37:14.774
<i>One of the differences between </i>
<i>home cooking and restaurant cooking</i>

37:14.857 --> 37:16.943
is in restaurants,

37:17.526 --> 37:22.615
you gotta pick your thyme,
because you can't get the stem.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.534
Home cooking, you just go like this.
Doesn't matter.

37:27.703 --> 37:33.209
What I hate about cooking at home is
that, like, everything's so much dirtier

37:33.292 --> 37:36.504
and I can't yell at everyone
like I would in a professional kitchen.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.256
-I wanna...

37:38.339 --> 37:40.883
I wanna say something to my mom right now,
but I can't.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.304
I wanna be like,
"What are you doing?" But I can't.

37:45.888 --> 37:49.475
I can't say, "Work cleaner!" I can't.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.149
Enough? Two more.
Yeah, two more.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.485
Yeah. I'm slow.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.946
Are you done cleaning the sink?

38:02.029 --> 38:04.865
Yeah, don't worry, Mom.
We'll clean up right now. Don't yell.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.367
No, it's okay. No.

38:06.450 --> 38:09.829
Now that the camera's on,
you're nice. I see how it is.

38:09.912 --> 38:11.998
<i>This is how tough this woman is.</i>

38:12.081 --> 38:16.168
She's had cancer four different times
over 25 years.

38:16.252 --> 38:19.964
The third time she had cancer,
it was in her brain, tumor.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.717
Two days after she was released
from the hospital,

38:22.800 --> 38:27.805
she has a bandage.
It's a chunk of brain here, right here.

38:27.888 --> 38:30.558
She's cooking me...
She's cooking me kimchi-jjigae.

38:32.518 --> 38:36.564
I remember, she was standing right here
and I was like, "Ma, what are you doing?"

38:39.233 --> 38:41.110
-Yes.

38:42.194 --> 38:44.447
Because you're the special. Mmm?

38:44.530 --> 38:46.324
Aw...

38:48.993 --> 38:51.203
Crazy woman.
My mom is a crazy woman.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.080
No, you're the only one crazy.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.623
Two days!

38:56.125 --> 38:58.919
<i>The women in my life </i>
<i>express love through food. </i>

38:59.628 --> 39:03.966
My grandmother was an amazing cook.
My mother is an amazing cook.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.843
-Maybe four.
-Mama.

39:07.386 --> 39:09.597
Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm.

39:10.264 --> 39:13.225
<i>Love was shown as,</i>
<i>"Have you had enough to eat?"</i>

39:13.309 --> 39:16.312
Till this day when I talk to my mom,
the first thing she says is,

39:16.395 --> 39:19.315
"What have you eaten?
Have you had enough to eat?"

39:20.483 --> 39:22.610
<i>The first thing I remember </i>
<i>my grandmother making me all the time</i>

39:22.693 --> 39:25.613
were these roasted potatoes with sugar

39:25.696 --> 39:28.783
and she learned how to make this
Russian soup with ketchup in it,

39:28.866 --> 39:29.742
which was very weird.

39:31.285 --> 39:33.621
<i>And when I associate food and love,</i>

39:33.704 --> 39:36.415
that's the kind of food
that makes me happy.

39:36.499 --> 39:40.086
And I think that maybe one reason
why I'm shying away from

39:40.169 --> 39:42.713
maybe more of
the Euro-centric style of food

39:42.797 --> 39:46.467
is that I associate
a lot of terrible memories with that.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.427
Working in a kitchen, and...

39:48.511 --> 39:49.804
I don't mean this physically,

39:49.887 --> 39:52.598
but mentally getting the shit
kicked out of you, that's hard.

39:52.681 --> 39:56.477
I associate better things with stuff
that I think my mom and grandmother made.

40:02.483 --> 40:03.984
You make this at home?

40:04.068 --> 40:07.029
Yes.
Often. Often.

40:07.113 --> 40:07.947
What?

40:08.030 --> 40:10.533
This is actually
a really good dessert to make at home.

40:10.616 --> 40:13.994
Chef...
Wait till you taste this one.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.622
Pressure's on. Looks beautiful.

40:16.705 --> 40:18.791
That looks so pretty.
Mmm-hmm.

40:18.874 --> 40:21.502
This is from 2015.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.462
I need a little bit of this on there.

40:23.546 --> 40:24.505
That's amazing.

40:24.588 --> 40:29.218
This caramel was like liquid,
and then, after a couple of years,

40:29.301 --> 40:33.347
the sugar from the prunes
have made it thick and it's perfect.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.267
That's home cooking.
-Mmm-hmm.

40:36.350 --> 40:37.518
That's so good.
-That is amazing.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.228
Yeah.
Holy cow!

40:39.854 --> 40:42.314
-Would this--
This is three Michelin Stars.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.194
You really think that cooking,
across the board, is better than ever?

40:47.778 --> 40:48.821
Oh, yeah.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.781
In the way that the world is open today,

40:50.865 --> 40:53.409
in the way that everybody shares
with each other...

40:53.492 --> 40:56.328
That, to me, is a new thing.

40:56.412 --> 40:58.038
<i>The world is open.</i>

40:58.122 --> 41:02.585
<i>People are sharing. People are flicking </i>
<i>on some social media</i>

41:02.668 --> 41:06.338
<i>and you put out the latest thing </i>
<i>you've been working on.</i>

41:06.422 --> 41:08.048
<i>You share everything today.</i>

41:08.132 --> 41:09.508
<i>There's more exchange</i>
<i>of information than ever.</i>

41:09.592 --> 41:10.718
<i>Much more!</i>

41:10.801 --> 41:14.013
What I don't like
about the exchange of information is,

41:14.096 --> 41:16.223
I think that, uh...

41:16.307 --> 41:19.977
the removal of struggle
to get that information

41:20.060 --> 41:21.270
creates bad cooking.

41:21.854 --> 41:24.857
I think cooks today know more
than ever before,

41:24.940 --> 41:29.361
but because it was so easy for them
to obtain, it's not special to them.

41:30.946 --> 41:33.240
I think you're wrong.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.494
You know, people just struggle
in a different way today.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.953
-No, you're right.
-You're just getting old, man.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.039
-Yeah, of course I'm getting old.

41:40.956 --> 41:44.251
I guess the romantic in me
is arguing for the...

41:45.544 --> 41:47.880
The peaks are much shorter now.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.382
One of the reasons
I wanna be in this profession

41:50.466 --> 41:54.094
is to be able to dream
for impossible goals.

41:54.178 --> 41:58.307
<i>And while the mean </i>
<i>is much higher than ever before, </i>

41:58.390 --> 42:00.434
<i>the difference between </i>
<i>the lowest of the low </i>

42:00.518 --> 42:04.313
<i>and the highest of the high</i>
<i>is not that different any more.</i>

42:04.396 --> 42:07.441
<i>And it's harder to find the tightness. </i>

42:07.525 --> 42:10.653
<i>I'm looking for that person </i>
<i>and I'm like, "Fuck!" Right?</i>

42:10.736 --> 42:11.820
Like, how do they do this?

42:11.904 --> 42:13.864
The person that'd get up every morning
and be like...

42:14.448 --> 42:16.659
They are gonna make me
work harder than ever before.

42:16.742 --> 42:18.786
Because I have to get to that level.

42:18.869 --> 42:20.287
Yeah.

42:20.871 --> 42:21.997
<i>They're out there.</i>

42:28.212 --> 42:31.048
Chang Thanksgiving 2016
coming to an end.

42:31.131 --> 42:32.841
Thank God.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.013
<i></i>
<i></i>

42:40.182 --> 42:41.225
Sure.

42:42.268 --> 42:45.396
-Meehan's cutting! Our guest.
Meehan's...

42:45.479 --> 42:47.439
First time a white person has ever cut

42:47.523 --> 42:49.775
a Thanksgiving turkey
in a Chang household.

42:49.858 --> 42:52.111
Come on, it's not about
that kind of day today.

42:52.194 --> 42:53.612
Love you.

43:00.327 --> 43:01.620
<i>Just wanted to thank everyone.</i>

43:01.704 --> 43:03.664
<i>It's been a long time</i>
<i>since we've all been together.</i>

43:05.833 --> 43:09.128
We have Pete Meehan,
who's basically a Chang,

43:09.211 --> 43:11.714
and I'm a Meehan,
because we've been together so long.

43:12.339 --> 43:16.427
Uh, but I always love Thanksgiving
because of this.

43:16.510 --> 43:20.222
We can celebrate over food
and hopefully not bicker too much.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.851
Mom and Dad, we love you very much.

43:23.934 --> 43:28.939
Thank you so much for being patient
and providing for all of us.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.524
-Cheers!
Thank you.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.151
Yeah.

43:32.234 --> 43:34.820
["This Must be the Place
" playing]

43:35.904 --> 43:38.240
Damn.
The cornbread is really good.

43:40.951 --> 43:43.621
<i>Food that I like has a sense of community,</i>

43:44.204 --> 43:47.124
<i>has a sense of a narrative </i>
<i>that's being told,</i>

43:47.207 --> 43:48.459
<i>and, often times, </i>

43:48.542 --> 43:51.712
as cliché as it sounds,
it's food that's made with love.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.967
<i>That's what separates a good meal </i>
<i>versus a tremendous meal.</i>

44:09.146 --> 44:11.273

"Dave, what's your career goals?"

45:25.139 --> 45:28.517
It's like, buying the Redskins
from Dan Snyder.

45:29.101 --> 45:31.145
I'm gonna change the name
to The Chinks.
