¶¶

00:09.643 --> 00:12.444
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.446 --> 00:14.813
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.815 --> 00:17.616
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:20.185
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:20.187 --> 00:22.488
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.490 --> 00:25.190
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.192 --> 00:29.561

is waiting for me ¶

00:29.563 --> 00:32.998

00:45.312 --> 00:50.649

¶¶

01:08.702 --> 01:10.035
Ahh...

01:10.037 --> 01:12.438
Happy birthday, Sofia!

01:12.440 --> 01:15.607
Clover, it's a little bit
early for shouting.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.676
Oh, oh, okay.
Then, tell me,

01:17.678 --> 01:20.679
is it too early for
your birthday breakfast
in bed?

01:20.681 --> 01:22.381
Is that
a propeller plum?

01:22.383 --> 01:23.882
Mm-hmm, your favorite.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.085
Oh, Clover,
I only just woke up

01:26.087 --> 01:28.253
and this birthday
is already ah-mazing.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.755
Yeah, well, you know
what they say.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.723
Everything goes great
on your birthday.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.092
Who says that?

01:33.094 --> 01:36.695
Mm, I said it,
and now I'm gonna sing it.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.064
Ha ha! Where are
my backup birds?

01:39.066 --> 01:40.299
Hit it, Whatnaught.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.539
¶ It's your birthday ¶

01:47.541 --> 01:49.808
¶ It's gonna be great ¶

01:49.810 --> 01:52.644
¶ We got so much
to celebrate ¶

01:52.646 --> 01:55.114
¶ Gonna have a party ¶

01:55.116 --> 01:57.649

01:57.651 --> 02:00.919
¶ Yeah, everything
is gonna be great ¶

02:00.921 --> 02:01.987
Whoo!

02:08.929 --> 02:10.596
¶ All your friends ¶

02:10.598 --> 02:12.965
- ¶ Are coming over ¶
- BIRDS: ¶ Coming over ¶

02:12.967 --> 02:15.601

02:17.905 --> 02:20.739

¶ You'll get all kinds
of fun surprises ¶

02:27.915 --> 02:32.251

02:32.253 --> 02:36.522

02:36.524 --> 02:40.692

the Enchancian ¶

02:40.694 --> 02:42.161
( knocking )

02:42.163 --> 02:45.097
The happiest of birthdays
to you, Princess Sofia.

02:45.099 --> 02:48.767
Behold, a gift from Colette,
the royal dressmaker.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.703
Baileywick, it's beautiful!

02:51.705 --> 02:53.872
It is, isn't it?
Now hurry up.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.775
Your birthday party guests
will be arriving soon.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.112
You're right, Clover.

03:00.114 --> 03:03.248
Everything is gonna go great
on my birthday!

03:07.188 --> 03:09.054
¶ It's your birthday ¶

03:09.056 --> 03:10.822
¶ It's gonna be great ¶

03:10.824 --> 03:12.858
¶ The sun is shining ¶

03:12.860 --> 03:14.826
¶ It's gotta be fate ¶

03:14.828 --> 03:16.461
¶ I love my new dress ¶

03:16.463 --> 03:18.830
¶ It's greater
than great ¶

03:18.832 --> 03:21.867
¶ Yeah, everything
is gonna be great ¶

03:21.869 --> 03:23.302
¶ It's party time ¶

03:23.304 --> 03:25.637
¶ Everything
is gonna be great ¶

03:25.639 --> 03:27.005
¶ Party, party time ¶

03:27.007 --> 03:29.041
- ¶ It's your birthday ¶
- ¶ My birthday ¶

03:29.043 --> 03:31.977
¶ So everything
is gonna be great ¶

03:31.979 --> 03:34.246
¶ It's gonna be great ¶

03:34.248 --> 03:37.716
¶ It's gonna be great ¶

03:39.186 --> 03:41.820
Don't forget
your breakfast.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.690
( whirring, squeaking )

03:44.692 --> 03:45.657
SOFIA: Oh!

03:45.659 --> 03:48.694
Oh, no! My greater-
than-great dress!

03:48.696 --> 03:51.563
Ooh, that's not
so greater-than-great.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.699
Sorry, Sof.
Hey, but don't worry!

03:53.701 --> 03:56.501
We'll scrub that stain
out in a jiffy.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.709
( gasps )

04:03.711 --> 04:05.377
Here, let me do it.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.712
( struggling )

04:06.714 --> 04:08.747
Wait, that's just
making it worse.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.550
- ( ripping )
- ( Sofia exclaims )

04:11.552 --> 04:15.754
- Ohh...
- Well, at least
the stain is gone.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.922
I guess so.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.857
See? Sofia, come on.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.926
Your big day's
gonna be great.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.361
I sure hope so.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.697
BOTH: Happy birthday, Sofia!

04:25.699 --> 04:28.267
Ruby, Jade!
You're here already?

04:28.269 --> 04:30.636
We came early to help
you set up your party.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.037
Now, close your eyes...

04:32.039 --> 04:34.539
So we asked ourselves,

04:34.541 --> 04:37.309
"What do you give
the princess
who has everything?"

04:37.311 --> 04:39.811
Even Tizzy,
my fairy godmother,
was stumped.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.814
Good thing Jade always comes
through with the big ideas.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.717
So, we made,
just for you...

04:45.719 --> 04:46.918
Ta-da!

04:46.920 --> 04:48.153
Wow!

04:48.155 --> 04:49.921
All the balloons
and party hats

04:49.923 --> 04:51.923
have your face
painted on them.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.059
Because you're
our favorite person!

04:54.061 --> 04:55.494
I love it.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.428
Thank you.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.896
Happy birthday, Sofia.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.431
I came early
to help, too.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.499
Me too!

05:00.501 --> 05:03.969
( popping )

05:03.971 --> 05:05.404
Oops.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.306
- Oh, no!
- Our balloons!

05:07.308 --> 05:09.508
Sorry. Crackle
has the hiccoughs,

05:09.510 --> 05:13.312
but at least there's
one balloon left.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.414
Oops!
Oh, sorry, Sofia!

05:15.416 --> 05:18.784
It's okay. We still
have the party hats.

05:18.786 --> 05:22.254
From here on out, I'm sure
everything is going to be--

05:22.256 --> 05:23.922
A tragedy!

05:23.924 --> 05:25.924
Hi, Amber.
What's wrong?

05:25.926 --> 05:27.926
That dress,
for starters.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.595
Were you attacked
by a herd of wild animals?

05:30.597 --> 05:31.697
Sort of.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.798
Don't worry.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.800
It's not as bad
as the real tragedy.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.101
Your birthday cake!

05:36.103 --> 05:37.969
What's the matter
with my birthday cake?

05:37.971 --> 05:40.339
Somebody stuck
his fingers in it!

05:40.341 --> 05:43.375
I couldn't help it, Amber.
It's delicious!

05:43.377 --> 05:45.510
Uh! This is
a birthday party, James,

05:45.512 --> 05:47.713
not feeding time
at the zoo.

05:47.715 --> 05:51.183
Sorry. But wait till you see
what I got you, Sofia.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.285
Happy birthday!

05:54.822 --> 05:56.822
Oh, it's
fantastic, James.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.989
Thanks!

05:57.991 --> 05:59.991
I made it
and Cedric enchanted it,

05:59.993 --> 06:01.360
so it'll fly for hours!

06:01.362 --> 06:03.362
Whoa!

06:03.364 --> 06:06.064
( exclaiming )

06:06.066 --> 06:08.867
( honking )

06:08.869 --> 06:12.871
So... when does it turn
and fly back?

06:12.873 --> 06:16.007
Um... I guess we didn't
think about that.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.509
Rex, fetch!

06:17.511 --> 06:18.844
( barking )

06:18.846 --> 06:21.380
BOTH: Happy birthday,
Sofia!

06:21.382 --> 06:23.248
Are you excited
for your big--

06:23.250 --> 06:25.817
Uh, where is James's
gift flying off to?

06:25.819 --> 06:28.220
And what happened
to your balloons?

06:28.222 --> 06:30.889
Mom, Dad, everything
is going wrong,

06:30.891 --> 06:34.025
even the special dress
Colette the dressmaker
made me.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.862
What's wrong with it?

06:36.864 --> 06:38.864
Oh, I'm sure no one
will even notice.

06:38.866 --> 06:42.000
( exclaims )

06:42.002 --> 06:43.201
Who is that?

06:43.203 --> 06:45.170
That's Colette,
the royal dressmaker.

06:45.172 --> 06:48.073
Oh, you just got off to a bit
of a rocky start, Sofia.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.842
There is still a lot
of fun things coming up.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.611
Games, cake...

06:52.613 --> 06:55.180
Our big
father-daughter dance.

06:55.182 --> 06:58.417
Ah, you'll see, sweetheart.
It's all going to turn around.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.385
You'll have
a great birthday.

07:00.387 --> 07:03.388
Baileywick, let the rest
of Sofia's guests in.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.856
Right away, sire.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.958
Gifts go on the table
to your left,

07:06.960 --> 07:08.760
and games are
to your right.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.430
Whoa! Enjoy.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.802
( bells clanging )

07:19.306 --> 07:20.705
Uhh!

07:22.075 --> 07:24.109
Hey! How's
it going, Sof?

07:24.111 --> 07:27.078
Everything's turning around,
just like Mom and Dad said.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.914
The games are a big hit,

07:28.916 --> 07:30.949
especially Stick the Tail
on the Dragon.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.651
CRACKLE: Hey, watch it!

07:32.653 --> 07:36.254
Okay, the bad news is someone
just stuck a tail on me.

07:36.256 --> 07:39.591
The good news is,
it startled my hiccoughs away!

07:39.593 --> 07:40.759
Crackle, look out!

07:40.761 --> 07:42.260
( barking )

07:42.262 --> 07:43.662
Almost got it, Sofia!

07:43.664 --> 07:45.130
Aah!

07:48.735 --> 07:49.768
BOTH: Our hats!

07:49.770 --> 07:50.769
My toy!

07:50.771 --> 07:51.670
My cake!

07:51.672 --> 07:53.905
SOFIA: My party.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.074
Don't feel bad, Sofia.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.109
You and I can still
show 'em how it's done.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.945
Clear the floor, please.

07:59.947 --> 08:03.882
It's time for the royal
father-daughter birthday dance.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.951
¶¶

08:05.953 --> 08:07.052
( crowd exclaims )

08:09.356 --> 08:11.056
( hiccoughs )

08:12.626 --> 08:14.593
Guess my hiccoughs
came back.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.697
Poof! Hey, there, Ruby!

08:18.699 --> 08:20.432
Oh, did I miss
the whole party?

08:20.434 --> 08:22.300
I got so caught up
in trying to think

08:22.302 --> 08:25.203
of a birthday present for Sofia,
I lost track of time!

08:25.205 --> 08:27.606
Yeah, the party's
pretty much over.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.374
It was
a real disaster.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.609
( honk )

08:30.611 --> 08:32.844
Mm. Anything I can do?

08:32.846 --> 08:37.449
I am your fairy godmother,
but there's no rule
against helping your friends.

08:37.451 --> 08:39.551
Huh. I don't know,
Tizzy.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.554
Well, let me
at least try.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.122
Oh, I'm sorry
your birthday

08:44.124 --> 08:45.957
didn't go the way
you hoped, Sofia.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.960
Thanks, Mom.
It wasn't so bad.

08:48.962 --> 08:52.597
I managed to rescue
one piece of birthday cake.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.333
Why don't you
make a wish?

08:55.335 --> 08:59.170
I wish-- I wish I could have
my birthday all over again,

08:59.172 --> 09:02.173
and this time,
have a happy one.

09:02.175 --> 09:05.143
Now, that's a birthday gift
I can make happen.

09:05.145 --> 09:08.847
I think. I'll just check
the old fairy spellbook.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.148
Poof!

09:10.150 --> 09:11.950
Oh, yes! Here it is.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.923
Just wait
until tomorrow, Sofia!

09:26.500 --> 09:28.400
Happy birthday, Sofia!

09:28.402 --> 09:32.837
Ahh! Clover, I said
no shouting. Please.

09:32.839 --> 09:36.374
Oh, okay. But did you say
no birthday breakfast in bed?

09:36.376 --> 09:37.509
Ta-da!

09:37.511 --> 09:39.611
It's not
my birthday, silly.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.046
That was yesterday.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.782
Yesterday?
( laughs ) Seriously.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.584
Have a birthday
propeller plum!

09:45.586 --> 09:47.085
This is getting strange.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.386
( knocking )

09:48.388 --> 09:51.690
The happiest of birthdays
to you, Princess Sofia.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.259
Baileywick! Oh, I'm
so happy to see you.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.128
( gasps ) Is that
<i> another</i> special dress?

09:57.130 --> 09:59.431
Another one? No.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.634
This is your birthday gift
from Colette
the royal dressmaker.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.770
Isn't it beautiful?
Now, hurry up and put it on.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.305
Your guests
will arrive soon.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.075
What's happening?

10:10.077 --> 10:13.111
Am I living
the same day over again?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.280
Oh, happy birthday, Sofia!

10:15.282 --> 10:16.982
( chitters )

10:27.794 --> 10:32.163
This is the same dress,
with no stain or rip!

10:32.165 --> 10:33.465
Why would there
be a rip?

10:33.467 --> 10:35.166
Because of the propeller plum!

10:35.168 --> 10:36.968
Thank you for reminding me.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.170
Hey, don't forget
your breakfast!

10:39.172 --> 10:41.172
Clover, no!

10:41.174 --> 10:42.607
Aah!

10:42.609 --> 10:44.576
I changed it!

10:44.578 --> 10:46.077
I changed what happened!

10:46.079 --> 10:50.415
I am living the same day over,
but I-- I made it better!

10:50.417 --> 10:54.486
Thanks for your help,
guys, but I think I need
a moment to myself.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.820
Gotcha, princess.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.023
You gotta get ready
for your birthday,

10:58.025 --> 11:00.358
'cause it only happens
once a year.

11:04.665 --> 11:08.299
Yeah. I'm not so sure
about that anymore. Aah!

11:08.301 --> 11:11.770
Hiya, Sofia. Enjoying
your second-chance birthday?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.304
What do you mean?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.674
You made a wish to do
your birthday over again,

11:15.676 --> 11:17.308
and I granted it!

11:17.310 --> 11:20.879
You mean I really get
to do my birthday over again?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.881
Every single minute of it!

11:22.883 --> 11:26.484
But this time it can be
a happy birthday!

11:26.486 --> 11:30.321
Oh, I hope so.
Thank you, Tizzy, thank you!

11:30.323 --> 11:33.625
Second-chance birthday,
here I come.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.494
BOTH: Happy birthday, Sofia!

11:36.496 --> 11:39.297
Ruby, Jade!
You're here already?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.399
We came early to help
you set up your party.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.034
Now, close your eyes...

11:43.036 --> 11:45.303
So we asked ourselves,

11:45.305 --> 11:48.139
"What do you give
the princess
who has everything?"

11:48.141 --> 11:50.642
Even Tizzy,
my fairy godmother,
was stumped.

11:50.644 --> 11:53.845
Good thing Jade always comes
through with the big ideas.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.346
Wait, let me guess.

11:55.348 --> 11:58.249
You painted my face
on all the balloons
and party hats?

11:58.251 --> 12:00.985
Wow. That was
a really good guess.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.354
It just came to me.
Thank you.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.424
Happy birthday, Sofia.
I came early to help, too.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.559
Me too!

12:07.561 --> 12:09.928
( popping )

12:11.898 --> 12:13.565
- Oh, no!
- Our balloons!

12:13.567 --> 12:16.735
Oh, I forgot about Crackle
and the balloons.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.737
Sorry! Crackle
has the hiccoughs,

12:18.739 --> 12:22.373
but at least there's
one balloon left.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.775
( gasps )
The last balloon!

12:23.777 --> 12:25.176
Uhh!

12:25.178 --> 12:27.011
Wow, nice move!

12:27.013 --> 12:28.546
You saved
our last balloon!

12:28.548 --> 12:29.914
You know what they say.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.383
Everything goes great
on your birthday.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.586
Now, if I can just
stay on my toes,

12:34.588 --> 12:36.187
this day will be...

12:36.189 --> 12:37.355
A tragedy!

12:37.357 --> 12:38.723
Amber!

12:38.725 --> 12:40.792
Right. You're
worried about...

12:40.794 --> 12:41.893
Your birthday cake!

12:41.895 --> 12:43.094
Right, because...

12:43.096 --> 12:44.963
Somebody stuck
his fingers in it.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.097
Mm! Mm.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.232
I couldn't help it.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.767
It's delicious!

12:48.769 --> 12:51.035
Oh, missed that one.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.304
( licking )

12:53.306 --> 12:56.141
But wait till you see
what I got you, Sofia.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.309
Uh-oh.
It's fantastic, James,

12:58.311 --> 12:59.911
but I don't think
you should...

12:59.913 --> 13:01.780
I made it
and Cedric enchanted it,

13:01.782 --> 13:03.248
so it'll fly for hours!

13:03.250 --> 13:04.883
Wait! I've got an idea.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.385
I'll, um, put it
under here

13:07.387 --> 13:09.587
so it doesn't,
you know, accidentally

13:09.589 --> 13:11.389
fly into one
of the regatta piñatas

13:11.391 --> 13:12.791
and knock over
Amber's cake!

13:12.793 --> 13:15.393
( laughs ) Like
that'll ever happen!

13:15.395 --> 13:17.328
BOTH: Happy birthday, Sofia!

13:17.330 --> 13:18.963
Hey, nice balloon!

13:18.965 --> 13:21.266
And your dress
looks lovely.

13:21.268 --> 13:24.636
Doesn't it?
I dodged the plum.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.572
So, Baileywick, shall we
let in our guests?

13:27.574 --> 13:30.008
( chuckles ) That's what
I was going to say!

13:30.010 --> 13:32.010
Uhh!

13:32.012 --> 13:33.845
Hey! How's it
going, Sof?

13:33.847 --> 13:35.446
Well, I kept my dress
in one piece,

13:35.448 --> 13:37.282
saved one of Ruby
and Jade's balloons,

13:37.284 --> 13:40.451
and stopped James's carriage
from knocking over the cake
and ruining the dance floor!

13:40.453 --> 13:42.587
I'd say it's going great.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.855
Right.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.424
Sofia, ready
for our dance?

13:46.426 --> 13:47.525
Absolutely.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.431
And now, the royal
father-daughter dance.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.435
¶¶

14:03.276 --> 14:04.475
- ( ripping )
- Oh!

14:04.477 --> 14:06.277
Oh, no, it ripped again!

14:06.279 --> 14:07.478
Aah!

14:07.480 --> 14:09.147
( exclaiming )

14:09.149 --> 14:11.316
Hey, my carriage!

14:11.318 --> 14:12.483
Look at it go!

14:12.485 --> 14:14.652
No! Watch out!

14:14.654 --> 14:16.554
( honking )

14:22.729 --> 14:23.862
Our hats!

14:23.864 --> 14:25.530
- My toy!
- My cake!

14:25.532 --> 14:28.066
My party... again.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.167
( pop )

14:29.169 --> 14:33.238
Oops. Still got
those hiccoughs.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.475
- Poof!
- Oh, hi, Tizzy.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.044
So, how was
birthday number two?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.145
It was okay.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.480
Didn't you have fun?

14:42.482 --> 14:44.148
Sort of. Kind of.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.483
Not really.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.718
Oh, no.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.420
So you had two bad
birthdays in a row?

14:49.422 --> 14:51.923
Aw, I'm sorry,
Sofia.

14:51.925 --> 14:55.493
That's okay. I'm just
kind of glad it's over now.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.329
I'm getting a little tired
of birthdays.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.832
Well, I'm sure tomorrow
will be better.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.834
At least it'll be different.

15:02.836 --> 15:04.569
( sighs drowsily )

15:13.513 --> 15:16.114
Happy birthday, Sofia!

15:16.116 --> 15:18.383
Dah! Clover, please!

15:18.385 --> 15:20.451
Stop doing that!

15:20.453 --> 15:23.454
- But it's your birthday!
- Again?

15:23.456 --> 15:26.457
Now, who wants
a birthday breakfast in bed?

15:26.459 --> 15:30.228
- I don't understand.
- Then I'll sing it.

15:30.230 --> 15:33.298
Clover. Clover, stop.

15:33.300 --> 15:37.402
( muffled ) But don't you want
to hear a song about how great
your birthday's gonna be?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.404
I know I just woke up,
but I already feel

15:39.406 --> 15:42.140
like I've had more
than enough birthdays today.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.541
Can I meet you downstairs?

15:43.543 --> 15:44.375
Sure thing, Sof!

15:44.377 --> 15:47.946
After all, it's
your big--!

15:47.948 --> 15:49.914
Tizzy! Tizzy,
where are you?

15:49.916 --> 15:51.249
( knocking )

15:51.251 --> 15:54.419
Happiest of birthdays,
Princess Sofia. Ohh!

15:54.421 --> 15:56.387
Thanks, Baileywick,
it's a beautiful dress.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.156
Can you tell my guests
I'll be with them soon?

15:58.158 --> 16:01.459
Of course. Oh, birthdays
can be so frantic!

16:02.395 --> 16:04.329
Ugh, you have no idea.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.396
Tizzy!

16:05.398 --> 16:08.099
Poof! Hi, Sofia.
What's happening?

16:08.101 --> 16:12.437
My birthday is happening
for the third time!

16:12.439 --> 16:13.671
That's strange.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.507
I thought your spell would
only give me one do-over.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.109
So did I. Huh.
But to be honest,

16:18.111 --> 16:21.446
I didn't read
the spellbook that closely.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.480
Hmm.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.282
Maybe I should do that now.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.850
Poof!

16:25.852 --> 16:29.020
It says here
you'll magically keep
reliving this day

16:29.022 --> 16:32.490
over and over until you have
a truly happy birthday.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.860
A truly happy birthday?

16:35.862 --> 16:38.463
That's the only way
to break the spell.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.799
Well, yesterday I avoided
most of the problems.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.669
But then everything
fell apart at the end.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.471
Well, that's rough.

16:46.473 --> 16:50.108
I guess I have to avoid
every single problem
if I want to break the spell.

16:50.110 --> 16:54.312
Well, in my experience,
it's hard to avoid
<i> every</i> problem.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.280
Not for me, not today.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.049
Because I've had practice.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.318
I mean, I'll get it over
with a single try,

17:00.320 --> 17:01.886
or even in ten tries.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.956
But in the end, I will stop
everything bad from happening

17:04.958 --> 17:07.558
and have a perfectly
trouble-free birthday.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.659
A<i> happy</i> birthday.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.661
Right, happy.
That's what I said.

17:10.663 --> 17:14.899
But do you really think
you can stop every bad thing
from happening?

17:14.901 --> 17:16.734
Oh, hi, Tizzy.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.569
Hey, Sof, I forgot
to give you

17:18.571 --> 17:20.371
your breakfast
propeller plum.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.739
Catch!

17:23.510 --> 17:25.243
Just watch me.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.621
( hiccoughs )

17:43.363 --> 17:44.328
Gah!

17:54.574 --> 17:55.573
Gah!

18:00.246 --> 18:03.247
( honking )

18:03.249 --> 18:07.285
( barking )

18:12.058 --> 18:13.024
Gah!

18:14.260 --> 18:15.526
( honking )

18:15.528 --> 18:18.696
( barking )

18:23.236 --> 18:24.035
Gah!

18:26.239 --> 18:29.107
( barking )

18:31.811 --> 18:32.977
( applause )

18:41.821 --> 18:43.754
( sighs )

18:43.756 --> 18:45.656
Ah.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.661
Poof! Sofia, how did birthday
number 37 go?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.597
Perfect. Finally.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.732
Kept everything
from going wrong.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.301
Now the spell will end!
For sure.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.605
But did you
have fun? Sofia?

19:00.607 --> 19:01.672
( snoring )

19:06.980 --> 19:08.312
Poof!

19:15.822 --> 19:17.688
Happy birthday, Sofia!

19:17.690 --> 19:20.124
Aah! Clover! No!

19:20.126 --> 19:21.259
Yes!

19:21.261 --> 19:22.460
But why?

19:22.462 --> 19:24.996
I made everything
go right! ( groans )

19:24.998 --> 19:27.798
I'm trapped
in a birthday wish forever!

19:27.800 --> 19:30.001
That sounds awful,
because everything

19:30.003 --> 19:31.802
should go great
on your birthday!

19:31.804 --> 19:33.504
It's impossible, Clover.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.673
According to the spell,
I'll keep reliving

19:35.675 --> 19:37.708
my birthday
until I'm truly happy!

19:37.710 --> 19:40.611
Only how am I supposed
to be truly happy

19:40.613 --> 19:42.680
when everything
always goes wrong?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.882
And even when I work
really, really hard

19:44.884 --> 19:46.817
and make everything
go right,

19:46.819 --> 19:48.619
it still doesn't
reverse the spell!

19:48.621 --> 19:50.655
How happy
do I have to be?

19:50.657 --> 19:53.191
I'm happy, okay?
I'm happy!

19:55.495 --> 19:58.663
If that's what happy looks like,
I'd hate to see sad.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.231
( knocking )

20:00.233 --> 20:03.568
The happiest of birthdays
to you, Princess Sofia.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.803
- ( groans )
- Are you all right?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.672
( muffled )
I'm fine, Baileywick!

20:07.674 --> 20:09.073
I'll be down
in a minute!

20:09.075 --> 20:11.642
I'll let
everyone know.

20:12.845 --> 20:16.814
Hey, Sof, I wish there was
something I could do.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.416
I give up, Clover.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.018
Give up?
Not on my watch.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.689
It's no use, guys.
I tried everything.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.991
Cheer up, Sof.
You have to look
on the bright side.

20:26.993 --> 20:32.163
Like you get
to start your birthday
with a delicious breakfast!

20:33.933 --> 20:36.400
Ugh! Again?

20:36.402 --> 20:37.735
Oops! Sorry?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.704
Huh. Wait a minute.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.039
There may be a bright side
to this, after all!

20:42.041 --> 20:43.341
Get more plums.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.780
Now smush one
on the dress.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.015
Say what now?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.085
See? Now you try.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.787
Hmm. Ha! Okay.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.592
( laughs )

21:01.594 --> 21:03.394
Polkadots!

21:03.396 --> 21:05.630
That doesn't look
half bad.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.565
Let's finish
the other half!

21:07.567 --> 21:10.268
( laughing )

21:10.270 --> 21:13.571
Everyone, I was just
in Princess Sofia's room,

21:13.573 --> 21:16.007
and we may have a problem.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.644
Aah!

21:19.646 --> 21:21.946
What have you done
to my dress?

21:21.948 --> 21:24.148
I had some fun with it.
Do you like it?

21:24.150 --> 21:26.284
Like it? I love it!

21:26.286 --> 21:29.820
Plum polkadots!
A new fashion trend!

21:29.822 --> 21:31.889
<i> C'est magnifique!</i>

21:31.891 --> 21:34.925
Sofia, that is
one fun birthday dress.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.894
Well, it's gonna be
one fun birthday!

21:36.896 --> 21:39.664
Wait till you see
what I got you!

21:39.666 --> 21:42.800
A flying carriage!
Thank you, James.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.735
I made it,
and Cedric enchanted it,

21:44.737 --> 21:47.238
so it'll fly for hours.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.439
- ( honking )
- ( screaming )

21:48.441 --> 21:50.341
It's headed
for the piñata regatta!

21:50.343 --> 21:51.909
Oh, no! Rex, fetch!

21:51.911 --> 21:54.745
( barking )

21:58.651 --> 21:59.917
Our hats!

21:59.919 --> 22:02.119
- My toy!
- My cake!

22:02.121 --> 22:04.322
My party!

22:04.324 --> 22:06.424
You know what?
It's okay.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.793
No matter what happens,
it's going to be

22:08.795 --> 22:12.663
a great birthday because I
have all of you here.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.833
( applause )

22:15.835 --> 22:18.769
( barking )

22:20.940 --> 22:23.207
Happy birthday, Sofia!

22:23.209 --> 22:24.875
Gah! Really?

22:24.877 --> 22:27.144
It's time for birthday
breakfast in b--

22:27.146 --> 22:28.813
( laughs ) I'm just kidding.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.114
You broke the spell. Yay!

22:30.116 --> 22:33.150
Oh, Clover.
Is it really tomorrow?

22:33.152 --> 22:36.654
Look! It is different.
It's raining!

22:36.656 --> 22:40.358
Yeah, bummer. Looks like
we're stuck inside today.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.659
Cheep up, Clover.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.961
All you really need
to have a happy day

22:43.963 --> 22:45.896
is to look
on the bright side.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.579
