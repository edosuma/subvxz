WEBVTT

00:02.156 --> 00:03.658
- Sarah, we're so happy
to have you back.

00:03.758 --> 00:05.259
So the trip was a success?

00:05.359 --> 00:07.141
- Oh, yeah, the Sacramento
Children's Theatre

00:07.241 --> 00:10.704
did a wonderful job
of putting up "Unsung Sheroes,"

00:10.804 --> 00:13.306
and I didn't kill my parents
while I was staying with them.

00:13.406 --> 00:14.667
- Bravo to that.
- Here, here.

00:14.767 --> 00:16.769
- Mm-hmm.
- [clears throat]

00:19.451 --> 00:21.313
- So what did I miss?
What's new with you guys?

00:21.413 --> 00:23.835
- Well, I'm actually
starting my new novel.

00:23.935 --> 00:25.917
It's a bit of a departure.
Let me ask you something.

00:26.017 --> 00:28.879
In a futuristic society where
everyone's assigned a number,

00:28.979 --> 00:31.742
what happens
when you're assigned a letter?

00:34.504 --> 00:37.647
W is about to find out.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.328
- Just to clarify,
we're not in it, right?

00:39.428 --> 00:40.649
- This is not about us?
- No, no.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.171
It's an allegory
for the refugee crisis--

00:42.271 --> 00:43.452
- I don't need to know.
- More than I need to hear.

00:43.552 --> 00:44.733
Okay.

00:44.833 --> 00:48.116
- Something fun
"gong on" with me.

00:50.077 --> 00:52.179
- So, Marina,
how is the design business?

00:52.279 --> 00:53.660
Pretty good.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.862
I have two new projects
with a new contractor,

00:55.962 --> 00:58.264
and no, he is not hot.

00:58.364 --> 01:00.026
- Yeah, total uggo.
It rocks.

01:00.126 --> 01:04.029
- Well, um, today we have
our first IVF appointment.

01:04.129 --> 01:05.631
- Oh, whoa.
- Yes.

01:05.731 --> 01:07.913
So after all of those
month and months

01:08.013 --> 01:09.874
of planning and saving...

01:09.974 --> 01:11.436
- And now that we are
super flush with all of that

01:11.536 --> 01:12.917
- children's theatre money...
- Mm-hmm.

01:13.017 --> 01:13.998
- It's happening!
- [squeals]

01:14.098 --> 01:16.280
- Wow,
that's such exciting news.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.041
Gong-gratulations.

01:18.141 --> 01:19.402
Okay, fine.

01:19.502 --> 01:21.804
Connor, what's up
with the fancy gong?

01:21.904 --> 01:23.806
- It was a gift
from my financial advisor

01:23.906 --> 01:27.129
to motivate my rise
back to the top.

01:27.229 --> 01:30.812
- And how many millions has
this magic gong brought you?

01:30.912 --> 01:32.133
I haven't even hit it yet.

01:32.233 --> 01:33.534
I wanted the first one to be
for all of us.

01:33.634 --> 01:35.336
- both: Aww.
- That's actually sweet.

01:35.436 --> 01:37.698
- So here's
to Marina's new job,

01:37.798 --> 01:39.219
Tom's new book,

01:39.319 --> 01:41.621
Sarah and Denise's
first IVF appointment,

01:41.721 --> 01:43.023
and, most importantly,

01:43.123 --> 01:47.707
my re-crushing
of the business world.

Everybody, stay calm!

01:57.415 --> 01:59.317
Earthquake! Earthquake!

01:59.417 --> 02:01.478
- You two, under the table.
- Okay, okay.

02:01.578 --> 02:03.840
Drop, cover, and hold on.

02:03.940 --> 02:05.242
Protect your head
and your neck,

02:05.342 --> 02:07.844
and do not attempt
to exit the building.

02:07.944 --> 02:09.605
- Honey.
- Earthquake! Earthquake!

02:09.705 --> 02:12.828

02:30.563 --> 02:31.904
They're already back
on their phones.

02:32.004 --> 02:34.026
I told them to save their
batteries, but they ignored me.

02:34.126 --> 02:36.028
So yeah,
totally back to normal.

02:36.128 --> 02:37.629
- I think
I'm probably fine too.

02:37.729 --> 02:39.071
- No, Sarah, take it easy.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

02:39.171 --> 02:40.192
Nope. I'm not fine.
I'm not fine.

02:40.292 --> 02:41.192
- Okay, maybe
we should postpone

02:41.292 --> 02:42.393
our doctor's appointment.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.115
- No.
Dr. Patel is so in demand.

02:44.215 --> 02:45.396
We'll never get
another appointment.

02:45.496 --> 02:47.558
- It's fine. I can just
text them and reschedule.

02:47.658 --> 02:49.279
Yeah, don't be a hero.

02:49.379 --> 02:53.083
- Okay, everyone.
Back up. Give me some space.

02:53.183 --> 02:55.004
Let's get you bandaged up,
little lady.

02:55.104 --> 02:57.286
- Whoa, what's with the hat
and the vest and everything?

02:57.386 --> 02:59.128
- Oh, it's part
of my emergency go bag.

02:59.228 --> 03:02.571
We've got a first aid kit,
hand crank radio,

03:02.671 --> 03:05.573

inflatable tent,

03:05.673 --> 03:08.416

inflatable vest, jerky...

03:08.516 --> 03:09.737
- You had all that
in your trunk?

03:09.837 --> 03:10.978
All right, it's swelling,

03:11.078 --> 03:12.459
but the cut's not too deep.

03:12.559 --> 03:13.740
I'm gonna clean it,

03:13.840 --> 03:15.141
I'm gonna apply
some antibiotic fluid,

03:15.241 --> 03:16.262
and then I'm gonna wrap
your foot up

03:16.362 --> 03:17.383
and continue icing it.

03:17.483 --> 03:18.785
Tom, why don't you sit down

03:18.885 --> 03:20.106
and start cutting
some pieces of adhesive?

03:20.206 --> 03:21.307
You got it.

03:21.407 --> 03:23.268
Okay.
[laughs]

03:23.368 --> 03:25.150
That's a lot of blood.
Ooh, that's a lot of blood.

03:25.250 --> 03:26.471
That's--it's a lot of blood.

03:26.571 --> 03:28.833
- Okay, okay.
This is not helpful.

03:28.933 --> 03:30.194
- It's a lot of blood.
- Honey, honey, why don't you

03:30.294 --> 03:31.676
go and get Sarah
a glass of water?

03:31.776 --> 03:33.197
- Yeah, I'ma get
a glass of water for me too.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.478
- Yeah.
- Whoo.

03:34.578 --> 03:36.600
[chuckles]
The room is kind of moving.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.702
Is that one of the aftershocks?

03:40.583 --> 03:43.286
Man.

03:43.386 --> 03:46.488
Gong almost hit me in the head.

03:46.588 --> 03:48.130
I could've died.

03:48.230 --> 03:49.811
- Yeah, and it did
land on my foot.

03:49.911 --> 03:51.413
- Right, no, of course,
I get that,

03:51.513 --> 03:54.695
but on the way to your foot,
it came so close to my head.

03:54.795 --> 03:58.058
You know, I could feel the air
there like--like, moved.

03:58.158 --> 03:59.700
- Oh, you're the real
victim here.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.821
- Obviously, Marina,
there's multiple victims.

04:01.921 --> 04:04.784
Sarah, imagine what happened to
your foot happening to my head.

04:04.884 --> 04:06.265
Oh, believe me, I am.

04:06.365 --> 04:10.709
- This whole thing
is really making me think.

04:10.809 --> 04:12.811
Is it, though?

04:13.611 --> 04:15.113
- In through the nose.
- [inhales]

04:15.213 --> 04:16.554
- Out through the mouth.
- [exhales]

04:16.654 --> 04:18.155
Where did you get this go bag,

04:18.255 --> 04:20.277
and how'd you know how to deal
with Sarah's foot?

04:20.377 --> 04:24.161
- Oh, um, I took an emergency
prep class a few months ago.

04:24.261 --> 04:25.962
You were deep into
your book publicity

04:26.062 --> 04:27.644
and I didn't want
to bother you with it.

04:27.744 --> 04:29.365
- Oh, I'm glad you did.
Why now?

04:29.465 --> 04:32.288
- Well, remember our sex fire?
- Vividly.

04:32.388 --> 04:35.170
- Well, in that moment with the
flames going up the curtains

04:35.270 --> 04:37.932
and you screaming, "Fire!"
and then pouring

04:38.032 --> 04:40.134
cranberry juice on it and then
tripping on your pants--

04:40.234 --> 04:41.776
- No, I-I said I remembered it.

04:41.876 --> 04:43.697
- Well, I wanted us
to be prepared

04:43.797 --> 04:45.799
if there was a next time.

04:47.641 --> 04:49.903
- Wait, so you took a course
'cause you didn't trust

04:50.003 --> 04:51.824
I would know how to come
through in an emergency?

04:51.924 --> 04:54.507
- No.
Honey, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:54.607 --> 04:57.589
Everyone plays
an important role in a crisis.

04:57.689 --> 04:59.631
Your role is to...
[breathing raggedly]

04:59.731 --> 05:01.513
Like, call attention
to the problem

05:01.613 --> 05:03.274
while others deal with it.

05:03.374 --> 05:06.197
It's a super important role.

05:06.297 --> 05:07.718
All right, I'm gonna do
a second head count

05:07.818 --> 05:09.820
at 1400 hours!

05:15.304 --> 05:17.086

05:17.186 --> 05:19.188
- What?
- Nothing.

05:23.471 --> 05:25.013
[sighs]

05:25.113 --> 05:27.895
- I'm not playing this game.
- It's just this house.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.897
It's got every cool gadget
you can think of,

05:29.997 --> 05:32.819
but with the power off,
it's useless.

05:32.919 --> 05:35.301
- I guess you're going to have
to hand sort your coins.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.263
- I mean,
what if I had died today?

05:37.363 --> 05:39.185
Would this be my legacy?

05:39.285 --> 05:42.988
Just a freaking sweet house
filled with useless stuff?

05:43.088 --> 05:45.670
I was so excited
to bang that gong,

05:45.770 --> 05:47.832
add a few extra zeroes
to my bank account,

05:47.932 --> 05:49.914
but for what?

05:50.014 --> 05:51.916
- These are
important questions.

05:52.016 --> 05:53.037
You know what I think
you should do?

05:53.137 --> 05:54.878
Huh?

05:54.978 --> 05:58.281
Make yourself useful.

05:58.381 --> 06:01.044
- Oh, I see
where you're going with this.

06:01.144 --> 06:02.164
Where I'm going with what?

06:02.264 --> 06:04.286
- Instead of focusing
on myself,

06:04.386 --> 06:05.888
I should be of service
to others.

06:05.988 --> 06:08.130
- Mm.
- Huh.

06:08.230 --> 06:11.012
Helping people.

06:11.112 --> 06:13.214

you're cool enough

to start watching
"Boom Boom Dojo" with me.

- Or we could watch

"Pastry Chef Junior" because
there's, like, cakes and stuff.

06:41.218 --> 06:43.600
- Or we could FaceTime
my friend Xander.

He's got a cute
younger brother.

You know,

07:02.236 --> 07:03.977
actually, a bit relieved.

07:04.077 --> 07:06.179
I thought I was ready
to start IVF,

07:06.279 --> 07:08.581
but for so long,
the actual doing it

07:08.681 --> 07:10.183
was so far in the future,

has arrived,

I would be devastated.

07:18.209 --> 07:19.391
Oh, God,
it's getting me emotional

07:19.491 --> 07:21.152
just talking about it.

07:21.252 --> 07:24.075
- I was just asking
about your foot.

07:24.175 --> 07:26.276
- Oh, my foot.
[chuckles]

07:26.376 --> 07:28.999
Right. Um, it hurts.

07:29.099 --> 07:30.240
Mm.

07:30.340 --> 07:31.761
- You know, wait.
Lupe, sorry.

07:31.861 --> 07:33.403
If we could just--
we could just forget about

07:33.503 --> 07:35.084
all that other stuff.
I mean, what even was that?

07:35.184 --> 07:37.366
That was--it was just
my hurt foot talking.

07:37.466 --> 07:39.468
- I'm really not that invested.
- Okay.

07:41.870 --> 07:43.411
What are you doing?

07:43.511 --> 07:45.893
- Uh, taking inventory
of our food supply.

07:45.993 --> 07:47.335
It's a thing you do
in a crisis.

07:47.435 --> 07:49.857
- Another thing you do
is keep the fridge door shut

07:49.957 --> 07:52.339
when the power is off.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.621
And also, you could just
see through the glass.

07:54.721 --> 07:56.422
- Can't tell if the milk's
expired through glass.

07:56.522 --> 07:58.544
[chuckles]
What are you doing?

07:58.644 --> 08:00.226
- Oh, after the earthquake,
I checked the gas line.

08:00.326 --> 08:01.547
Right. Right.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.108
- To make sure
the shutoff valve tripped.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.309
- Pfft.
Thinking the same thing.

08:04.409 --> 08:06.111
- And what was the result?
- I smelt gas,

08:06.211 --> 08:07.752
so I'm just making sure
there isn't a leak.

08:07.852 --> 08:09.033
- Beat me to it.
[chuckles]

08:09.133 --> 08:10.715
So look, now that I, uh,

08:10.815 --> 08:13.917
took care
of the food supply issue,

08:14.017 --> 08:15.158
- do you need help with anything?
- Sure.

08:15.258 --> 08:17.500
- Could you fill the bathtubs?
- Yes. On it.

08:19.502 --> 08:21.444
Fill them with...

08:21.544 --> 08:22.805
- Water.
- Bubble baths.

08:22.905 --> 08:25.127
Keep the kids calm. Smart.

08:25.227 --> 08:28.490
- No, so that we have water
if the water is shut off.

08:28.590 --> 08:31.092
Right. Water for survival.

08:31.192 --> 08:33.194
Not bub-tubs.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.777
Obviously, I'm upset

08:36.877 --> 08:38.899
that we're missing
our first IVF appointment.

08:38.999 --> 08:41.541
I've been thinking about this
for so long.

08:41.641 --> 08:43.503
- Yup.
- And I want to do it.

08:43.603 --> 08:44.944
I really do.
It's just,

08:45.044 --> 08:47.666
now that we're at the day,
I'm thinking,

08:47.766 --> 08:50.509
what if it works and Sarah
actually gets pregnant

08:50.609 --> 08:52.911
and it's hard for her
and she hates it

08:53.011 --> 08:54.712
and the only reason she's
putting herself through this

08:54.812 --> 08:56.674
is because
I couldn't do it myself?

08:56.774 --> 08:58.155
- You need to talk
to your wife.

08:58.255 --> 09:00.517
- [groans]
If only it was that easy, Lupe.

09:00.617 --> 09:02.159
I don't want Sarah
to all of a sudden think

09:02.259 --> 09:03.720
that I'm ungrateful
or something.

09:03.820 --> 09:05.762
[rumbling]

09:05.862 --> 09:08.324
Did you feel that?
A little aftershock?

09:08.424 --> 09:10.726
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah!

09:10.826 --> 09:13.048
It's shaking me
down the stairs.

09:13.148 --> 09:15.150
- I--I think it's done.

09:16.951 --> 09:18.212
Mommy, it's getting cold.

09:18.312 --> 09:20.094
Yeah, the heat's off.

09:20.194 --> 09:23.217
Um, maybe ask Gretchen to
borrow one of her sweatshirts.

09:23.317 --> 09:24.418
- You cold?
You say you're getting cold?

09:24.518 --> 09:26.499
- What if I built you a fire?
- That'd be cool.

09:26.599 --> 09:27.901
- Yeah--or well, not cool.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.622
Hot 'cause of the fire
that I'm gonna build you.

09:29.722 --> 09:31.464
- One fire coming up.
- Wait, wait, wait.

09:31.564 --> 09:34.226
What? Where? How?
Basically, all the questions.

09:34.326 --> 09:35.787
- Well, Connor's got
a portable,

09:35.887 --> 09:36.948
um--what do you call
those things?

09:37.048 --> 09:38.149
You know what I mean?
You light a...

09:38.249 --> 09:39.711
- Like a portable firepit?
- Yeah.

09:39.811 --> 09:41.392
I'll just set it up
in the courtyard, you know,

09:41.492 --> 09:43.234
it's open air, and then
I'll just get in there and...

09:43.334 --> 09:44.595
do my thing.

09:44.695 --> 09:46.356
- Well, if we're gonna
have a fire,

09:46.456 --> 09:48.078
maybe I should make it.

09:48.178 --> 09:49.639
- Why do you get to--
oh, 'cause...

09:49.739 --> 09:52.602
[chuckles]
It's my fire, so I'ma make it.

09:52.702 --> 09:55.324
- Tom, fires are
not that easy to make.

09:55.424 --> 09:57.206
- You know, I might not
have a green jacket,

09:57.306 --> 10:00.208
like, a cute matching helmet,
but I can do stuff.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.011
- Okay, go.
Make a fire, Tom.

10:03.111 --> 10:04.892
Thanks. I will.

10:04.992 --> 10:07.094
So one fire coming up.
Give me one minute.

10:07.194 --> 10:09.296
Or actually,
maybe a couple minutes.

10:09.396 --> 10:11.398
Make it a half hour.
I'll call you when I'm done.

10:12.679 --> 10:15.121
- Lupe, do we have
a fire extinguisher--

10:20.766 --> 10:23.909
Well, the swelling stopped,
so it looks like you might

10:24.009 --> 10:26.231
be able to go
to your appointment after all.

10:26.331 --> 10:28.753
- Yay.
- Amazing.

10:28.853 --> 10:29.954
I will just text them

10:30.054 --> 10:31.075
and let them know
we're back on.

10:31.175 --> 10:32.836
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait a sec.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.157
With the power out,
the gate won't open.

10:34.257 --> 10:35.438
You can't even
get your car out.

10:35.538 --> 10:37.440
You can't even get out
to get an Uber

10:37.540 --> 10:39.242
because none of the gates
will open.

10:39.342 --> 10:42.524
Everything's connected
in my stupid smart house.

10:42.624 --> 10:44.046
- Oh, shoot.
- Darn it.

10:44.146 --> 10:45.647
Lupe was right.

10:45.747 --> 10:47.889
I mean, making money just
for the sake of making money?

10:47.989 --> 10:49.290
It should be about
helping people.

10:49.390 --> 10:50.611
- Okay.
- And right now, the two people

10:50.711 --> 10:52.093
who need help
are a couple of lesbians

10:52.193 --> 10:53.534
who want to have a baby,

10:53.634 --> 10:55.175
and one of them's got
a wounded foot from a gong

10:55.275 --> 10:56.496
that almost took
her brother's head off.

10:56.596 --> 10:58.058
- What are you--what?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.059
Shh.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.781
I'm opening that gate for you.

11:01.881 --> 11:03.062
- Great.
- Wow.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.663
Yeah.

11:04.763 --> 11:08.267
- And how are you planning
on doing that?

11:08.367 --> 11:10.228
- I'm gonna outsmart
the smart house.

11:10.328 --> 11:14.192
[grunting]

11:14.292 --> 11:16.474
Why doesn't this city
have some kind of

11:16.574 --> 11:18.155
earthquake warning system?

11:18.255 --> 11:20.237
Connor, don't hurt yourself.

11:20.337 --> 11:25.081
- I mean, like, what are we
even paying taxes for?

11:25.181 --> 11:27.163
It's almost enough
to make you want to vote.

11:27.263 --> 11:28.844
Maybe hurt yourself a little.

11:28.944 --> 11:30.606
It's okay if you can't
get the gate open.

11:30.706 --> 11:32.487
Sarah and I, we'll just get
a different appointment.

11:32.587 --> 11:33.888
It's just so frustrating,

11:33.988 --> 11:37.492
and the stupid manual override
is rusted shut.

11:37.592 --> 11:39.593
Stupid fog.

11:42.716 --> 11:43.937
I'm making a fire.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.659
- We have sweaters and stuff
inside if--

11:45.759 --> 11:48.641
- I'm making a fire
to keep us all alive.

11:52.684 --> 11:53.946
- Seriously,
don't break it for us.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.707
It's not just for you.

11:55.807 --> 11:58.710
- Ever since
I was nearly decapitated

11:58.810 --> 12:00.952
by an ancient Chinese
symbol of wealth,

12:01.052 --> 12:04.194
I've been trying to think,
how can I be of, like, service?

12:04.294 --> 12:06.076
- Service?
- Yeah.

12:06.176 --> 12:07.717
What if I think bigger,
you know?

12:07.817 --> 12:09.359
Maybe I set up
a bunch of scholarships

12:09.459 --> 12:13.162
or reinvest my money
into climate activism.

12:13.262 --> 12:15.964
Or maybe I do a raffle

12:16.064 --> 12:18.407
where I send one sick kid a year
down to the bottom of the sea

12:18.507 --> 12:20.248
in their own personal
submarine.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.529
- Probably one
of the first two things.

12:21.629 --> 12:25.292
Whatever I do, it starts now.

12:25.392 --> 12:28.695
The journey of 1,000 miles
begins with a single step.

12:28.795 --> 12:30.177
- Was that on the box
your gong came in?

12:30.277 --> 12:31.498
Hell yeah, it was.

12:31.598 --> 12:33.540
And right now, my single step

12:33.640 --> 12:35.421
is getting you
to that doctor's appointment.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.903
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

12:38.003 --> 12:41.226
- [lighter clicking]
- Catch fire. Catch fire.

12:41.326 --> 12:42.988
- Maybe try putting the wood
in a cone shape.

12:43.088 --> 12:45.310
- Honey, I know what I'm doing.
Thank you.

12:45.410 --> 12:47.071
- Okay, so then you know
that you should use tinder

12:47.171 --> 12:48.592
to get the kindling started.

12:48.692 --> 12:51.275
- I wrote about this
in "Jeremiah's Plan," remember?

12:51.375 --> 12:53.437
When the inmates use
their prison cigarettes

12:53.537 --> 12:55.198
to light a fire
to distract the guards,

12:55.298 --> 12:56.359
so Jeremiah could smuggle

12:56.459 --> 12:57.680
Hickory Bob out
in a laundry cart?

12:57.780 --> 12:59.922
- [chuckles]
- Yes, my favourite part.

13:00.022 --> 13:01.443
- Wait.
Something's happening here.

13:01.543 --> 13:02.885
[blowing]

13:02.985 --> 13:04.366
Oh, it's catching fire.

13:04.466 --> 13:06.808
Fire, baby!
[laughs]

13:06.908 --> 13:08.289
Uh-oh. No, no, no, no, no.
No, come on.

13:08.389 --> 13:09.410
[blows]
What's going on here?

13:09.510 --> 13:10.451
Come on.

13:10.551 --> 13:14.895
[blowing rapidly]

13:14.995 --> 13:17.657
- Don't blow like that.
You're gonna hyperventilate.

13:17.757 --> 13:20.980
- I'm not gonna hyperventilate.
[blowing]

13:21.080 --> 13:23.082
[coughs]
I'm just gonna lie down.

13:26.645 --> 13:29.547
[fire crackling]

13:29.647 --> 13:32.190
Oh, I made that?

13:32.290 --> 13:34.992
Oh, you made that.

13:35.092 --> 13:36.914
Team effort?

13:37.014 --> 13:39.196
- Sorry. I guess I was kind of
acting like a jerk.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.917
No.

13:41.017 --> 13:42.799
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:42.899 --> 13:45.001
I just wanted to be
the protector,

13:45.101 --> 13:47.403
but don't worry,
message received.

13:47.503 --> 13:49.284
- I'm not trying
to send a message.

13:49.384 --> 13:51.967
I'm just doing
what needs to be done.

13:52.067 --> 13:53.928
- Yeah. Exactly.
'Cause I'm totally useless.

13:54.028 --> 13:55.610
Just promise me
when the apocalypse comes,

13:55.710 --> 13:57.051
you won't eat me first.

13:57.151 --> 13:58.452
Tom, come on.

13:58.552 --> 14:00.534
Not much meat
on those bones anyway.

14:00.634 --> 14:02.336
[chuckles]

14:02.436 --> 14:05.138
- Although, soup...
- [laughs]

14:05.238 --> 14:06.619
- So we can all agree,
we're gonna watch

14:06.719 --> 14:08.341
a supercut of animals
riding other animals.

14:08.441 --> 14:10.463
Yes, just play it.

14:10.563 --> 14:12.564
- [voice shaking]
I need it.

14:13.325 --> 14:14.786
Where's my tablet?

14:14.886 --> 14:17.829
<i>[bright music playing]</i>
[all screaming]

14:17.929 --> 14:20.351
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Go, go, go!

14:20.451 --> 14:21.752
It only has 1% left.

14:21.852 --> 14:23.153
- Let's watch
as long as we can.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.635
<i>- Do you suffer</i>
<i>from acid reflux?</i>

14:24.735 --> 14:26.436
Skip it! Skip it!

14:26.536 --> 14:28.638
[groans]

14:28.738 --> 14:30.860
Literally the worst day
of my life.

14:33.062 --> 14:35.724
Here I am, trying to be a...

14:35.824 --> 14:38.727
positive force in the world,
serve my community.

14:38.827 --> 14:41.369
I can't even help you guys
escape my stupid property.

14:41.469 --> 14:42.650
[sighs]

14:42.750 --> 14:45.012
Maybe I'm not the saviour
we all thought.

14:45.112 --> 14:46.894
Did we use the word saviour?

14:46.994 --> 14:48.215
- We were definitely
all thinking it.

14:48.315 --> 14:50.317
- Mm-hmm.
- Damn.

14:51.718 --> 14:53.539
- Mm, sorry we weren't able
to make our appointment.

14:53.639 --> 14:55.661
- Oh, me too.
- Yeah.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.583
- [groans]
- Yeah.

14:57.683 --> 14:59.745
Yeah.

14:59.845 --> 15:01.846
Yup.

15:03.408 --> 15:04.669
- It's a bummer.
- Such a bummer.

15:04.769 --> 15:06.110
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:06.210 --> 15:09.393
Just say it! Both of you!

15:09.493 --> 15:11.915
Say what you need to say
to each other.

15:12.015 --> 15:13.156
But wait until I leave.

15:13.256 --> 15:14.517
I don't want to get
dragged into it.

15:14.617 --> 15:16.119
[both scoff]

15:16.219 --> 15:17.760
- What was that?
- Who knows?

15:17.860 --> 15:19.161
[both laugh]

15:19.261 --> 15:21.563
- That was just, um...
- Weird.

15:21.663 --> 15:23.325
- Okay, don't be upset,
but I was really freaking out

15:23.425 --> 15:25.287
- about our doctor's appointment.
- Oh, me too.

15:25.387 --> 15:27.328
I was like, "Oh, my God,
it's really happening."

15:27.428 --> 15:29.250
And also, oh, my God.

15:29.350 --> 15:31.612
I mean, there are no guarantees
with IVF,

15:31.712 --> 15:34.214
and if it didn't work,
you'd be so disappointed.

15:34.314 --> 15:36.056
- Well, I was worried you were
gonna hate being pregnant

15:36.156 --> 15:37.417
and start resenting me because

15:37.517 --> 15:39.459
I wanted to do this
in the first place.

15:39.559 --> 15:41.821
Oh, Lulu, I love you.

15:41.921 --> 15:43.922
- I love you too.
[both chuckle]

15:45.804 --> 15:48.146
- You know,
maybe this earthquake

15:48.246 --> 15:50.148
was the universe's way
of telling us

15:50.248 --> 15:52.870
that we can just take
a little more time.

15:52.970 --> 15:55.152
- Well, I do believe in signs.
- Mm-hmm.

15:55.252 --> 15:57.594
[sighs] I'm really glad that
we got all this out in the open.

15:57.694 --> 15:59.316
- Me too.
- Yeah.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.317
- Thank you, Lupe!
- Thank you, Lupe!

16:01.417 --> 16:03.399
I'm not here.

16:03.499 --> 16:05.501
- [softly] She loves us.
- Yeah.

16:08.624 --> 16:10.525
- Is this what nights were like
when you were kids?

16:10.625 --> 16:12.847
How old do you think we are?

16:12.947 --> 16:15.329
- It's getting late.
When's the power coming back?

16:15.429 --> 16:17.831
- Soon, kiddo.
- You keep saying that.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.775
- Camila, have I ever told you
about the Keeper of the Flame?

16:21.875 --> 16:24.417
- Who?
- You don't know about Reena?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.619
The Keeper of the Flame?

16:26.719 --> 16:28.821
Well, we all want the power
to come back on,

16:28.921 --> 16:32.264
but thousands and thousands
of years ago,

16:32.364 --> 16:34.426
even before Aunt Denise
was born...

16:34.526 --> 16:35.667
Wow.

16:35.767 --> 16:37.188
- It was fire
that people wanted.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.630
'Cause fire gave them warmth,
it gave them light,

16:39.730 --> 16:41.592
but the gods could see how much
people loved their fire,

16:41.692 --> 16:43.153
and they grew jealous.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.275
So one day, there was
a great trembling of the earth

16:45.375 --> 16:46.636
and the gods stole the fire

16:46.736 --> 16:48.838
and left the people cold
and hungry in the dark.

16:48.938 --> 16:51.681
For no one was brave enough
to go fight for it--

16:51.781 --> 16:55.083
no one, that is,
except for the mighty Reena.

16:55.183 --> 16:56.845
See, Reena had the skills.
She had the confidence.

16:56.945 --> 16:58.847
She had the green pelt,

16:58.947 --> 17:02.890
which was
actually quite flattering.

17:02.990 --> 17:04.692
And even though she was scared

17:04.792 --> 17:07.014
and she knew there was
no guarantee of success,

17:07.114 --> 17:09.015
she ventured out into the dark.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.978
The first thing she saw
was a golden bridge

17:12.078 --> 17:13.980
that served as a gate
between her world

17:14.080 --> 17:15.581
and the new world
of adventure...

17:15.681 --> 17:17.943
And with that, Reena vanquished
the spirit wraith,

17:18.043 --> 17:20.545
thus completing
the seventh of her trials.

17:20.645 --> 17:22.467
And she returned home
with a spark

17:22.567 --> 17:24.589
to light a new fire

17:24.689 --> 17:27.631
along with the friends
that she met along the way.

The Golden Goliath,

and, of course,

17:34.297 --> 17:37.159
the kindly, misunderstood
Bog Hag.

17:37.259 --> 17:39.481
- Who do you think
is the Bog Hag?

17:39.581 --> 17:41.443
- You know, I don't know.
- Yeah.

17:41.543 --> 17:42.684
And to this day,

17:42.784 --> 17:44.326

around a fire,

I hate to say this,

18:01.800 --> 18:04.303
Sometimes when you want
something bad enough,

18:04.403 --> 18:07.345
you just have to do stuff
that scares you.

18:07.445 --> 18:08.947
Right.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.709

to stop thinking and jump in.

18:11.809 --> 18:14.191
Yeah.

18:14.291 --> 18:15.312

18:15.412 --> 18:17.414

In our tribe,
you're the storyteller.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.926
Yeah, I guess I am.

18:32.026 --> 18:34.248

we won't be seen
for another four months."
