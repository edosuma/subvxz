WEBVTT

00:10.135 --> 00:13.262
There, there, Alora.
We're away from trouble now.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.057
A new life awaits us both.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.687
It's the Empire!
They're seizing the ship!

00:20.771 --> 00:21.938
We need to get out of here!

00:37.121 --> 00:38.746
This is a civilian transport.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.623
We were granted clearance for takeoff.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.458
I'm afraid it's been canceled.

00:43.335 --> 00:47.296
As fortune would have it,
you carry a cargo of great interest to us.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.477
No!

01:02.604 --> 01:03.688
No!

01:15.325 --> 01:16.492
Keep away.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.582
Fear not, old one.
We wish to make friends.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.753
But first we have
some business to attend to.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.773
This is unexpected.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.232
Don't get me wrong.
It's always good to see you.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.984
But usually it means there's trouble.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.779
What I have to say is Jedi business.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.405
Then I guess I qualify.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.408
You qualify more than I do.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.084
I've been monitoring
transmissions from Mustafar

02:07.169 --> 02:09.045
to find out more about the Sith Lord.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.171
And?

02:11.048 --> 02:13.132
Information about him eludes me,

02:13.217 --> 02:15.468
but I've learned more
about his Inquisitors.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.262
It seems they have
a secondary mission to make retrievals.

02:18.597 --> 02:21.390
We know they hunt Jedi,
so what else are they after?

02:22.559 --> 02:24.977
At this point, I could only guess.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.438
I managed to decode
two sets of coordinates.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.690
I'm on my way
to investigate the first one.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.400
And you want me
to check out the second.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.485
I'm in.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.237
You should have Ezra join you.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.197
He's already briefed on the mission.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.910
Hey! She did say
this was Jedi business.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.871
Bring Zeb as well.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.666
He proved himself
against the Inquisitors before.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.543
So, where are we going?

03:09.606 --> 03:12.525
Did Ahsoka say exactly
what we were looking for?

03:12.609 --> 03:16.195
No, she just said we have to get
whatever it is before the Inquisitors do.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.614
Chopper, you have those coordinates?

03:22.786 --> 03:24.287
Housing units?

03:24.413 --> 03:26.205
What would Inquisitors want there?

03:26.290 --> 03:27.456
I doubt they're renting.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.751
Zeb, you take a look around
the spaceports for the Inquisitors' ship.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.837
lf they're already here, I'd like to know.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.046
Don't worry.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.382
lf I find any sign of 'em,
you'll hear about it.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.801
Bring Chopper. Stay in touch.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.764
Help.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.475
-I'm here.
-It's okay. You're safe now.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.937
Help me. Help my grandchild.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.021
Your grandchild?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.648
They took her.

04:33.732 --> 04:37.860
The red blades,
they knew that she has it.

04:37.945 --> 04:42.490
Find her. She has it...

04:42.908 --> 04:45.493
Rest. You need to rest.

04:45.577 --> 04:46.827
I will find her.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.830
I'm not following you anymore.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.749
I've lost track of where we've checked.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.459
Hey, where you going?

05:00.384 --> 05:02.718
Okay, yes. You found them.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.011
Congratulations.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.520
I see it. It's one of those lousy probes.

05:20.570 --> 05:24.448
lf I never see one of those things again,
it'll be too soon.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.908
You can come out now.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.955
Let's blast this ship and get outta here.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.552
I really hope
that's not a baby Inquisitor.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.347
No, we can't just leave it here.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.935
We'll blow up the ship
after we get the baby.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.270
What is wrong with you?

06:00.444 --> 06:02.403
No sign of Inquisitors.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.946
That's what worries me.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.126
This is it.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.299
Kanan, I think we're too late.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.514
Over here. She's alive.

06:30.599 --> 06:31.640
What's your name?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.976
Oora.

06:34.478 --> 06:35.978
Save your strength, Oora.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.774
"Pipey"?

06:39.858 --> 06:43.611
Her child.
She thinks they came for her child.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.446
Two red blades.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.658
They didn't get it.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.161
She managed to send her child
away with a droid.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.457
I promise you, Oora.
We'll find your Pipey.

07:00.837 --> 07:05.007
Oora, as soon as you're able to,
get to docking bay 12.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.260
Kanan, what do they
want with her child?

07:09.805 --> 07:11.514
I don't know, Ezra.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.107
You're telling me
there's another baby out there?

07:21.191 --> 07:22.733
And it's headed your way.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.112
When you find the droid,
tell it that the mother, Oora, sent you.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.239
Understood. On my way.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.616
That one's all yours.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.961
Garazeb Orrelios.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.714
Honored soldier,
feared rebel, baby hunter.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.719
At least I'm good at one of those things.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.890
Hey, droid!

07:56.059 --> 07:58.435
Wait, wait, wait. I'm here to help!

07:58.520 --> 08:00.187
Its mother, Oora, sent me.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.818
That's right, Oora.
She sent me for her child.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.993
That's a baby?

08:14.077 --> 08:15.995
I hope I'm holding it right side up.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.498
There, there, baby... Thing.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.668
It's okay, it's okay.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.546
Karabast! Why'd it have to be me?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.840
Kanan, I found the baby.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.050
Already? You're pretty good at this.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.260
Yeah. I know.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.596
-I'm taking it back to the ship.
-Copy that.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.930
We'll meet you there.

08:35.557 --> 08:40.102
No, I'm sorry. You can't come.
You have to act as a decoy.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.363
That's not good.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.041
That's really not good.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.296
Watch out!

09:08.298 --> 09:11.884
Spectre-1, making it back to
The Phantom is not going to happen.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.221
Copy that, Spectre-4. Where are you?

09:15.305 --> 09:17.848
On the move. Ran into your two friends.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.727
We'll be in the tower
at the grid nine intersection.

09:21.811 --> 09:22.895
Hurry.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.157
Wait.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.246
They are inside.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.335
You will be my eyes out here.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.803
This is grid nine.
Tower should be just ahead.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.680
Kanan, stop!

10:01.434 --> 10:02.935
This is definitely the place.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.965
Hey. Over here.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.051
-How's the baby?
-Quiet, for the moment.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.554
-Let's see him.
-I wouldn't if I were you.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.431
It'll just start shrieking again.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.691
I told you not to disturb him.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.901
I was trying to be nice.

10:53.278 --> 10:57.072
Well, try holding him.
You have the talent to connect, use it.

11:06.791 --> 11:07.791
Hey, hey.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.130
What's wrong with it?

11:20.013 --> 11:23.015
Ezra, you have to be calm
to keep him calm.

11:23.099 --> 11:26.101
Don't you think I'm trying?
I don't know what to do with him.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.811
Whatever you're doing, stop it!

11:28.313 --> 11:29.730
You are making it worse!

11:32.108 --> 11:34.109
Zeb! Get back, now!

11:39.866 --> 11:41.867
-Where to now?
-Only one way left.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.285
Hold him!

11:52.837 --> 11:55.089
I've got something they can retrieve.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.931
Move, move!

12:08.478 --> 12:09.895
Come on, Pipey.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.106
lf you keep this up,
we'll never shake them.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.567
Wait! Maybe that can buy us time.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.028
Keep moving,
and keep your comlink on.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.245
They are here.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.496
Are you certain?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.916
You would question me,
Seventh Sister?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.211
Only when you're wrong, Fifth Brother.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.937
Nice plan, but if you hadn't noticed,
we've run out of floors.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.607
They hunt Jedi, right?
Instead of Pipey, let 'em hunt me.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.776
Don't you mean "us"?

12:57.861 --> 12:59.278
You have to get the little one outta here.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.029
And I think I know how.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.699
Use the cooling ducts.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.784
I won't let you face them without me.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.454
Hey, you made a promise
to return this child to his mother.

13:08.538 --> 13:12.374
And the best chance we've got to keep it
is for you to calm him down.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.462
I can't. He's terrified.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.380
Because he senses your fear.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.549
How can he sense my fear?

13:21.968 --> 13:23.886
Because he's strong with the Force.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.345
I should've seen it.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.599
The Inquisitors are after these kids
because they're like you, Ezra.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.143
They're afraid the children
could grow up to become Jedi.

13:32.061 --> 13:36.732
All very illuminating,
but as time is at a bit of a premium...

13:42.280 --> 13:44.281
Don't have too much fun without us.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.826
May the Force be with you.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.040
Look, it's gonna be fine, Pipey.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.292
All we gotta do is find a way down.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.337
Well, hang on, little buddy.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.922
We're gonna go for a ride.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.847
They are close.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.099
Don't waste our time again.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.365
Pipey, quiet.

14:26.449 --> 14:29.535
Calm down. Calm down.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.788
Calm down.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.039
Hey!

14:36.292 --> 14:38.293
Kanan Jarrus.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.797
You've crawled out of hiding at last.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.699
Once I get you back to your mother,

15:08.783 --> 15:10.909
maybe you could come
live with us on Garel.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.661
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

15:16.791 --> 15:18.250
Once I get you back to your mother,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.586
maybe you could come
live with us on Garel.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.260
Time for a new strategy.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.428
Run!

15:39.856 --> 15:42.107
I hope you know what you're doing!

15:48.364 --> 15:49.531
A speeder!

15:49.616 --> 15:52.159
I can't believe it! How'd you know?

15:52.243 --> 15:53.493
I didn't.

15:56.539 --> 16:01.209
Commander, send in reinforcements
and lock down all spaceports.

16:07.342 --> 16:10.135
We gotta take the long way,
buy Ezra some time.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.028
Go faster!

17:00.103 --> 17:02.270
Yeah, you can say that again.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.985
Let me in! Let me in, Chopper!

17:09.070 --> 17:10.237
Paranoid droid.

17:10.321 --> 17:13.198
The door is locked, Kanan!
The door is locked!

17:13.282 --> 17:15.283
I'm a little preoccupied at the moment!

17:45.606 --> 17:47.983
I don't have time to waste on you, child.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.343
Unexpected, but not unwelcome.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.679
Ezra, get the youngling to the ship.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.271
Come on, guys! Guys! Get up!

18:26.355 --> 18:27.981
Get up! We gotta get moving!

18:31.736 --> 18:33.820
-What about Ahsoka?
-She's doing fine.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.202
I know why you want the children.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.079
Well, who doesn't want to be a mother?

18:52.215 --> 18:53.965
We gotta go back for her.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.134
lf we get airborne,
I bet she'll just come to us.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.373
You are beaten.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.588
Move in!

19:36.467 --> 19:39.469
It looks like
you are the one that is beaten.

19:45.393 --> 19:48.603
Your capture will please Lord Vader.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.944
Tell your master he'll have to wait.

20:25.975 --> 20:29.019
That was crazy, but worth it.

20:29.103 --> 20:32.397
They're Force sensitive.
I've seen this before.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.233
A Sith Lord attempted the same
thing back in the Clone Wars,

20:35.318 --> 20:37.027
but the Jedi Order stopped him.

20:37.111 --> 20:40.113
And now there's no Jedi Order
to protect them.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.331
Okay, I guess that task falls to us now.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.649
Once I get you back to your mother,

21:15.733 --> 21:17.901
maybe you could come
live with us on Garel.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.110
You'd like that wouldn't you?

21:19.195 --> 21:20.445
Once I get you back to your mother,

21:20.529 --> 21:22.405
maybe you could come
live with us on Garel.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.657
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

21:23.741 --> 21:27.327
We would love to visit you on Garel.
