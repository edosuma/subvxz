02:07.861 --> 02:10.128
Can I help you?

02:10.131 --> 02:13.899
It's your brother
and his family, they're uh...

02:13.901 --> 02:15.134
What?

04:22.997 --> 04:24.963
Are you done yet?

04:24.965 --> 04:25.998
No, sweetie.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.455
Are you done now?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.724
Soon, I promise.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.400
You said this would be fun.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.634
I know. I know.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.844
You load the fridge downstairs?

05:12.846 --> 05:14.446
Mmmhmm.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.315
Did you?

05:16.317 --> 05:17.349
I said yes.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.721
Three, two, one.

05:46.746 --> 05:47.779
Alright, go!

05:56.789 --> 05:58.690
I'm so glad you two are
working things out.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.425
He's so good with her.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.394
Not too bad on the eyes,
either.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.430
Yeah, he's a rock star when
he's not screwing his clients.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.133
Joke.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.474
Uh oh, almost!

06:16.509 --> 06:17.576
Yay!

06:19.512 --> 06:20.979
Candy!

06:20.981 --> 06:22.714
It's all mine!

06:26.652 --> 06:27.519
Can you take her, honey?

06:27.521 --> 06:28.920
I'm running late.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.389
Come on, we talked about this.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.423
About what?

06:33.693 --> 06:34.760
Rough sakes.

06:36.429 --> 06:37.496
What?

06:37.864 --> 06:39.865
Jane, I got a jobs
at ten and two.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.900
I've got an interview
with the "times".

06:44.637 --> 06:48.707
Fine. I'll take her to school
but you need to pick her up.

06:48.709 --> 06:49.741
Fine.

06:51.477 --> 06:52.544
No doughnuts.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.848
Are you guys getting
a divorce?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.850
No.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.719
Of course not.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.921
Marnie's parents are
getting divorced.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.490
Yeah, sweetie,
you're not marnie.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.993
You guys fight.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.061
Hey, kiddo.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.130
You're passive-aggressive.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.498
Did mom tell you that?

07:13.500 --> 07:14.533
No.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.638
Sweetie, your mother and i
love each other very much.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.540
We always will.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.841
But... sometimes people
make mistakes.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.781
I'm not the easiest
to deal with, alright?

07:31.517 --> 07:32.684
Your work has been centered

07:32.686 --> 07:34.920
on these old houses
for quite some time.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.189
What's the fascination?

07:37.191 --> 07:41.092
My parents died in an accident
when I was quite young.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.127
Uh...

07:42.129 --> 07:43.929
No, that's fine.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.932
I uh, I don't actually remember
a thing about them.

07:46.934 --> 07:51.870
But it feels like forgetting
something you know is important.

07:51.872 --> 07:55.607
You just have no idea
what it was.

07:55.609 --> 07:59.811
I've become fascinated
by these empty vessels

07:59.813 --> 08:02.481
that once housed such life.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.083
I want to go to work
with daddy.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.686
Carpentry is dangerous.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.789
But this is so boring.

08:10.791 --> 08:14.793
<i> The houses are like epitaphs.</i>

08:14.795 --> 08:18.997
<i> They're glimpses</i>
<i> into lives once lived.</i>

08:18.999 --> 08:21.766
<i> Echoes of the people</i>
<i> who once lived there.</i>

08:21.768 --> 08:23.635
Is that it? Nope.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.836
Is that it?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.706
Of course not, stupid.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.574
Who were they?

08:29.576 --> 08:30.809
Where did they go?

08:30.811 --> 08:32.177
Are they still alive?

08:33.578 --> 08:36.248
What did they leave behind?

08:36.250 --> 08:38.283
So what have you left behind?

08:39.150 --> 08:40.217
Uh...

08:57.803 --> 08:59.070
I'll tell you what.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.106
How about we stop at bj's
on the way home?

09:03.609 --> 09:05.677
Wow, turning down ice cream?

09:07.113 --> 09:08.947
This must be serious.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.224
<i> Mom?</i>

09:21.994 --> 09:23.895
<i> Mom, what is it?</i>

09:26.132 --> 09:27.899
<i> Mom, you're scaring me!</i>

10:00.666 --> 10:01.700
Hello?

10:03.869 --> 10:05.270
It's ok, you know.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.238
It is.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.917
Is this yours?

10:18.919 --> 10:20.385
<i> What's your name?</i>

10:25.391 --> 10:26.858
That's my mommy.

10:28.694 --> 10:29.761
No.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.864
No.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.033
I said no!

10:36.102 --> 10:37.268
Alice!

10:41.907 --> 10:43.074
Alice!

10:50.116 --> 10:51.650
Ali!

10:56.689 --> 10:58.356
I was calling for you.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.392
I know. That's why I came.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.161
I still expect to go
for ice cream.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.667
Come on.

11:25.317 --> 11:28.820
<i> Hi, county archives please?</i>

11:28.822 --> 11:30.822
<i> Yeah, I'd uh...</i>

11:30.824 --> 11:34.959
<i> Like to order the property</i>
<i> record for 1268...</i>

11:38.230 --> 11:39.264
Ok.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.014
Five...

13:36.016 --> 13:38.550
Four...

13:38.552 --> 13:41.252
Three...

13:41.254 --> 13:45.423
Two...

13:45.425 --> 13:48.426
Olly
olly oxen free

13:55.535 --> 13:57.302
honey.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.336
You startled me.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.508
What are you doing?

14:03.510 --> 14:06.010
I wet the bed.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.079
Hey, it's ok.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.414
It happens to the best of us.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.983
No it doesn't.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.619
Even daddy does
when he drinks too much.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.256
Come on.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.858
Let's go.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.407
<i> Are you alright?</i>

15:09.409 --> 15:11.142
Oh my gosh.

15:11.144 --> 15:11.142
<i> Jane.</i>

15:11.144 --> 15:13.311
I'm so sorry.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.113
<i> Come on, that's the second</i>
<i> time this week.</i>

15:15.115 --> 15:17.949
I know, I know, I know.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.984
I can be there in
twenty minutes, ok?

15:19.986 --> 15:20.685
<i> You know what? Never mind.</i>

15:20.687 --> 15:21.686
<i> I'll get her.</i>

15:21.688 --> 15:27.058
No. I'll leave right away,
i swear.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.059
<i> Fine.</i>

15:28.061 --> 15:30.161
<i> I'll call the school.</i>

15:30.163 --> 15:31.462
I'm sorry.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.281
Hello?

15:53.253 --> 15:55.019
I'm sorry, who?

15:57.357 --> 16:01.225
Alice, I can't hear you.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.661
I can't hear a word, honey.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.563
She wants you to come back.

16:11.003 --> 16:19.043
Five... four... three... two...

16:20.980 --> 16:22.714
Olly olly oxen free.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.135
<i> You need to come back.</i>

17:19.505 --> 17:20.570
<i> Jane?</i>

17:22.808 --> 17:24.075
Jane?

17:27.346 --> 17:28.378
Jane.

17:33.786 --> 17:34.819
Thank god.

17:39.458 --> 17:40.491
Jane?

17:40.692 --> 17:41.759
Mommy?

17:44.296 --> 17:45.663
There's been a mistake.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.099
You had an accident.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.367
I don't know you.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.435
It's not funny.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.469
Doctor!

17:51.471 --> 17:53.304
I don't know either of you.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.705
Can we get a doctor in here?

17:54.707 --> 17:56.407
What's wrong with her?

17:56.409 --> 17:57.442
Where am I?

17:58.844 --> 18:01.412
Hey, why are you here?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.614
My mom went crazy.

18:03.616 --> 18:08.653
She's not crazy,
she just has a secret.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.621
Although the injuries she
sustained in the accident

18:10.623 --> 18:12.390
were quite minor

18:12.392 --> 18:16.761
they appear to have aggravated a
very severe, but older, injury.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.795
Ok.

18:19.698 --> 18:20.765
Jane?

18:23.168 --> 18:24.235
Yeah.

18:24.237 --> 18:27.572
Doctor Michaels asked me
if I would speak with you.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.673
Ok.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.774
I'm Liam.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.809
I'm the on-call psychiatrist.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.347
I don't need a shrink.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.149
Well, Jane, I can help.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.385
I can help stimulate the
recovery of your memory...

18:41.387 --> 18:42.653
If you let me.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.323
You see these sine lines?

18:45.325 --> 18:47.191
They're remnants
from an old trauma,

18:47.193 --> 18:48.893
twenty years or more.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.562
Your wife's skull was fractured
in seven places.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.832
Scar tissue can impede
long-term memory,

18:54.834 --> 18:57.135
kind of like a splinter
in the brain,

18:57.137 --> 18:59.170
waiting for the body
to push it out.

19:01.173 --> 19:02.240
You're mistaken.

19:02.608 --> 19:03.674
And...?

19:04.877 --> 19:07.879
Her memory could
snap right back.

19:07.881 --> 19:11.349
But I have to warn you,
it could take months.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.885
I once had a patient who had to
re-learn the English language.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.319
It might even explain
your fascination

19:15.321 --> 19:17.488
with photographing old houses,
Mrs. reyer.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.863
I'm tired.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.765
Sure. Yeah.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.233
Another time then.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.905
Maybe spend some time
with your family, Mrs. reyer.

19:33.907 --> 19:35.540
I think it'll do them
as much good as you.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.607
Retten.

19:37.442 --> 19:38.509
I'm sorry.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.712
Reyer was my maiden name.

19:45.217 --> 19:45.216
Yes it was.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.787
Your memory is
improving already.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.902
Look, once she gets back
into familiar surroundings

20:04.904 --> 20:06.737
her condition will
likely improve.

20:43.942 --> 20:44.976
Hey.

21:16.408 --> 21:17.541
Are you alright?

21:23.582 --> 21:24.615
Yeah.

21:25.651 --> 21:26.717
That's good.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.320
Do you remember me now?

21:29.322 --> 21:30.354
Of course.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.925
Some things are still fuzzy
but it's getting better.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.564
As long as you remember
what matters most.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.637
Look, I'm gonna get her home
and uh, fed,

21:46.639 --> 21:48.372
but we'll be back tomorrow,
alright?

21:48.374 --> 21:49.607
Ok.

21:49.609 --> 21:50.641
Love you.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.015
And no doughnuts!

22:02.054 --> 22:03.888
I'm not sure why I said that.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.866
The brain is a remarkable thing.

22:15.868 --> 22:19.670
It can... it can re-wire itself,
repair itself.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.940
Even create false memories
to protect us.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.009
That's why we must treat the
cause, not just the symptom.

22:29.948 --> 22:31.415
Very good.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.983
Is there a heaven?

22:35.487 --> 22:36.787
Uh, I don't know.

22:37.456 --> 22:38.756
I'd like to think so.

22:39.658 --> 22:40.725
Then there's a hell.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.831
Sweetie, I think we live on
in the memories of the people

22:46.833 --> 22:48.966
that loved us.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.434
If we were good
in their life

22:50.436 --> 22:52.470
then their memories of us
will be too.

22:53.972 --> 22:56.407
What if they don't remember you?

22:56.409 --> 22:58.943
What happens then?

22:58.945 --> 23:00.778
Hey, mommy's not gonna
forget you.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.813
I met a girl who said
she would.

23:04.583 --> 23:07.651
Clearly she's a horrible little
person from a broken home.

23:08.954 --> 23:10.020
Doofas.

23:20.732 --> 23:21.799
Come in.

23:25.971 --> 23:27.037
Come in!

23:38.917 --> 23:40.418
I said, come in.

24:24.663 --> 24:25.763
You gonna open it?

24:27.065 --> 24:28.132
Jeez.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.834
I didn't mean to startle you,

24:29.836 --> 24:31.535
you've just been staring
at that box for two minutes.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.171
Oh my god.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.205
<i> Jane?</i>

25:14.813 --> 25:15.846
Ok.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.093
Hello?

26:06.097 --> 26:07.131
Hello?

26:40.932 --> 26:41.966
Oh, shit.

26:56.815 --> 26:58.182
Hey.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.186
Where did you get these?

27:02.188 --> 27:04.221
The county archives
delivered them.

27:07.025 --> 27:08.292
That's not possible.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.394
My foster parents would have
told me.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.629
Jane.

27:11.631 --> 27:16.834
These files just didn't appear
out of the blue.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.402
You ordered them.

27:18.937 --> 27:20.004
When?

27:20.639 --> 27:21.905
You tell me.

27:21.907 --> 27:25.175
I can't remember.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.210
You own that house.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.244
No!

27:29.180 --> 27:31.382
I forget little things,

27:31.384 --> 27:35.753
like appointments,
birthdays, pick-ups.

27:35.755 --> 27:36.787
Not...

27:42.927 --> 27:43.961
I'm sorry.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.198
I'm sorry.

27:52.837 --> 27:53.937
I shouldn't even be here.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.806
I should have picked her up.

27:59.277 --> 28:02.913
The trust fund's been paying
the property tax.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.949
It's managed by a...
Patrick ryer.

28:07.085 --> 28:08.152
I think you have an uncle.

28:10.321 --> 28:13.257
That explains why you keep
trying to photograph the place.

28:18.063 --> 28:19.263
Jane, hey.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.998
Hey.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.733
We'll figure this out.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.270
It's gonna be really positive.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.337
It's an opportunity.

28:29.974 --> 28:32.743
I barely remember
my own family.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.379
Visiting your childhood home

28:35.381 --> 28:38.082
could really stimulate some
repressed memories.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.886
Why don't you at least
call your uncle?

28:42.888 --> 28:45.155
Spend some time
at the house.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.824
It certainly can't hurt.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.762
<i> Hello?</i>

29:27.132 --> 29:28.198
Patrick ryer?

29:30.902 --> 29:32.035
<i> Speaking.</i>

29:36.141 --> 29:36.907
<i> Hello?</i>

29:36.909 --> 29:36.907
<i> Are you still there?</i>

29:36.909 --> 29:40.077
Uh... yeah.

29:40.079 --> 29:40.911
I um...

29:44.783 --> 29:46.150
Are you the brother of-

29:46.152 --> 29:47.184
who's calling, please?

29:48.119 --> 29:49.253
<i> My name's Jane.</i>

29:53.825 --> 29:54.858
Jane?

29:55.493 --> 29:56.560
<i> Yeah.</i>

30:00.064 --> 30:01.298
Wow.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.835
Uh...

30:04.837 --> 30:10.874
Um... are we...

30:10.876 --> 30:12.242
Are you my uncle?

30:15.313 --> 30:23.320
I haven't seen you in a...
Uh... but yeah.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.122
<i> Yeah, I sure am.</i>

30:25.824 --> 30:29.259
Um...

30:30.429 --> 30:34.898
Would it be ok if- if
i came by sometime?

30:34.900 --> 30:34.898
Um...

30:37.101 --> 30:38.936
<i> You're welcome any time.</i>

30:38.938 --> 30:39.970
<i> Of course.</i>

30:41.539 --> 30:42.606
Ok.

31:05.597 --> 31:06.630
Kinda familiar.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.269
Maybe it's just like every
other place I've photographed.

31:14.505 --> 31:16.974
I don't know.

31:30.889 --> 31:31.922
Patrick?

31:33.124 --> 31:35.525
You're the spitting image of
your mother.

31:40.164 --> 31:42.266
We tore down the old barn,

31:42.268 --> 31:45.335
turned your father's fields
there into corn and soy bean,

31:45.337 --> 31:46.370
if you believe.

31:48.339 --> 31:51.108
Your foster parents sold me
the fields

31:51.110 --> 31:54.011
on the condition that you
keepin' the house.

31:56.681 --> 31:59.549
Can't say I much wanted it

31:59.551 --> 32:02.953
on account of the memories
good and bad, you know?

32:08.159 --> 32:09.927
Um, I've gotta get something
off of my chest.

32:09.929 --> 32:13.096
It's been weighing on me.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.132
Um... about you
and foster care.

32:18.303 --> 32:21.405
I just didn't know the first
thing about bringing up a kid.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.639
I thought it'd be best for you.

32:22.641 --> 32:23.674
Still, somehow it...

32:26.144 --> 32:27.344
I don't know.

32:27.346 --> 32:30.414
Didn't sit right with me.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.448
I'm sorry.

32:38.589 --> 32:40.190
Let me know if you need
anything.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.363
What happened to them?

32:47.398 --> 32:49.466
I assumed somebody told you,
janey.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.200
I...

32:53.538 --> 32:56.606
Your parents and your sister
passed on in that house.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.212
I'm sorry.

33:06.517 --> 33:09.319
I'm just the idiot
with my foot in my mouth.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.356
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

33:25.036 --> 33:27.237
So anything familiar?

33:27.239 --> 33:29.673
I have never seen him before.

34:06.244 --> 34:07.778
You guys coming or what?

34:21.159 --> 34:22.192
It doesn't look too bad.

34:25.329 --> 34:25.328
It's hot and it smells.

34:28.632 --> 34:30.734
Tell us what you really feel,
kiddo.

34:30.735 --> 34:30.734
I just did.

34:33.638 --> 34:35.639
It does kinda smell,
doesn't it?

34:35.641 --> 34:37.841
Like old socks.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.143
Like stinky old socks.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.147
What's wrong, mom?

34:51.456 --> 34:52.489
Jane?

34:56.460 --> 34:58.495
You guys check out
the house.

34:59.664 --> 35:02.365
I'll take a look out back.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.469
Come on. I wanna explore.

35:05.471 --> 35:06.336
Alright, monkey.

35:06.338 --> 35:07.571
Be careful.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.106
Watch out for the big coyote!

35:10.742 --> 35:11.641
No!

36:04.495 --> 36:07.597
Looks like your mother's
old room when she was your age.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.370
This one's locked.

36:18.609 --> 36:20.210
See?

36:27.685 --> 36:28.718
We're in luck.

36:41.899 --> 36:42.966
Alice?

37:14.398 --> 37:15.999
Babe, be careful with that.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.234
I will.

37:18.803 --> 37:21.671
Hey, that's not a toy,
honey.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.506
Sweetie, it's vintage.

37:23.508 --> 37:25.508
But it's in a little
girl's room.

37:25.510 --> 37:27.444
Yeah, but when that little girl
played with it,

37:27.446 --> 37:28.979
it wasn't vintage.

37:28.981 --> 37:30.947
I'm gonna stay in your mother's
old room.

37:30.949 --> 37:31.982
Let's go.

37:35.786 --> 37:37.787
Come on, let's find-

37:41.692 --> 37:44.294
it's alright.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.729
<i> Uh oh.</i>

37:45.731 --> 37:48.798
<i> I hope mommy has another key</i>
<i> or else we are in trouble.</i>

37:48.800 --> 37:50.867
<i> You lost it.</i>

39:24.529 --> 39:26.563
You remember me?

39:27.765 --> 39:28.832
Of course.

39:31.836 --> 39:33.903
What about our marriage?

39:35.106 --> 39:36.373
It's fuzzy.

39:37.541 --> 39:38.608
How fuzzy?

39:41.612 --> 39:43.546
What do you want me to say?

39:51.589 --> 39:54.791
We were having some problems,
but who doesn't, right?

40:01.866 --> 40:04.901
You remember that I have a
monster dong though, right?

40:06.871 --> 40:08.571
Do you?

40:15.846 --> 40:17.547
Do you see their eyes?

40:17.549 --> 40:18.615
Look in their eyes.

40:18.617 --> 40:19.682
They're rectangular.

40:24.722 --> 40:25.622
Hey, janey.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.091
Someone needs their sugar fix.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.193
Meet you at the car.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.127
Candy apples!

40:31.129 --> 40:31.895
Yes!

40:31.897 --> 40:32.962
Come on.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.497
I'm gonna eat all
the candy apples.

40:34.499 --> 40:36.633
Mine, mine, mine!

41:31.222 --> 41:33.256
Help you find anything?

41:33.258 --> 41:36.025
I'm ok. Just browsing.

41:36.027 --> 41:37.260
Take your time.

41:49.273 --> 41:50.507
Excuse me.

41:53.544 --> 41:55.211
Can I see that?

41:56.981 --> 41:59.148
It's a shame to hang on to such
a tragedy, I know,

41:59.150 --> 42:02.986
but I never put much stock
in what they print anyway.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.750
Hello?

42:33.752 --> 42:34.784
<i> Jane.</i>

42:35.953 --> 42:37.186
Liam.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.088
<i> We had an appointment.</i>

42:39.623 --> 42:40.723
Did we?

42:40.725 --> 42:44.761
I'm sorry, I uh... I just uh...

42:44.763 --> 42:49.832
I took- I took your advice
and we're uh...

42:49.834 --> 42:52.802
We're at the family farm.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.305
<i> Oh, good.</i>

42:55.307 --> 42:57.774
I'm sorry about the appointment,

42:57.776 --> 42:58.775
I must have just-

42:58.777 --> 42:58.775
I must have just forgot.

42:58.777 --> 43:03.079
<i> That's ok, I'm proud of you</i>
<i> for giving it a chance.</i>

43:03.081 --> 43:05.114
<i> I'm glad you're alright.</i>

43:07.284 --> 43:09.285
Where are you?

43:09.287 --> 43:10.320
<i> At this moment?</i>

43:12.289 --> 43:14.023
I'm in my office, why?

43:20.230 --> 43:21.598
<i> Uh, Jane, I gotta go.</i>

43:21.600 --> 43:23.232
<i> I have a patient, but um...</i>

43:23.234 --> 43:25.001
<i> We'll talk soon, ok?</i>

43:25.003 --> 43:27.870
<i> I'll be seeing you.</i>

43:43.688 --> 43:44.721
Liam!

43:47.992 --> 43:49.025
Liam!

43:55.666 --> 43:56.699
Liam.

45:06.336 --> 45:08.871
Give me a friggin' break.

46:47.237 --> 46:50.406
If you did bad things
but don't remember,

46:50.408 --> 46:53.442
are they still part of
who you are?

46:55.379 --> 46:56.445
What?

46:58.916 --> 46:59.982
Never mind.

47:16.300 --> 47:17.366
Turn it off.

47:20.370 --> 47:21.437
Alan.

47:30.981 --> 47:32.014
Hey.

47:33.917 --> 47:35.151
Hey.

47:35.153 --> 47:36.185
Shh.

47:37.621 --> 47:40.056
They'll hear you.

48:14.558 --> 48:16.292
<i> When you have a bad dream,</i>

48:16.294 --> 48:20.496
<i> write it down on a piece of</i>
<i> paper and put it in a box.</i>

48:20.498 --> 48:23.499
And the butterfly fairies
will change those things

48:23.501 --> 48:25.668
so they're not scary anymore.

48:25.670 --> 48:27.570
<i> The fairies are in the box?</i>

48:27.572 --> 48:29.171
<i> Mmmhmm.</i>

48:29.173 --> 48:30.473
And they're nice?

48:30.475 --> 48:33.142
They are nice but they're
also tricksters.

48:33.144 --> 48:34.577
They tell us riddles.

48:34.579 --> 48:37.113
To understand them you have
to listen carefully

48:37.115 --> 48:39.348
because your eyes
can be easily tricked.

48:39.350 --> 48:41.217
Alice.

48:41.219 --> 48:43.119
Let's go.

48:43.121 --> 48:45.154
Alice isn't here right now.

49:01.104 --> 49:04.006
Alan, get up!

49:04.008 --> 49:06.208
Get up!

49:14.218 --> 49:16.052
You come find us.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.634
What are you doing, mommy?

50:07.204 --> 50:09.271
It's time to get up.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.075
It's 4:30!

50:16.246 --> 50:18.180
Go back to bed.

50:30.193 --> 50:31.627
Five, four, three, two, one.

50:31.629 --> 50:33.362
Five, four, three, two, one.

50:33.364 --> 50:35.064
Five, four, three, two, one.

50:35.066 --> 50:39.201
Five, four, three, two, one.

50:39.203 --> 50:46.709
Five... four... three... two...
One.

51:57.848 --> 52:00.783
My brother was a lot of things.

52:00.785 --> 52:02.318
Drunk.

52:02.320 --> 52:05.855
An asshole at times, sure.

52:05.857 --> 52:08.524
But he... he really loved
your mom.

52:08.526 --> 52:09.592
He loved you kids,

52:09.594 --> 52:14.597
even if he- even if he
didn't show it.

52:14.599 --> 52:18.701
I know it's hard digging up
all this stuff.

52:18.703 --> 52:21.270
I'm not sure if
I'm seeing things.

52:22.539 --> 52:24.140
Remembering things.

52:26.209 --> 52:29.145
Or someone's messing
with my head.

52:33.416 --> 52:36.185
Did I kill them?

52:39.322 --> 52:42.758
The only person who knows
what happened in that house

52:42.760 --> 52:45.227
is you.

52:51.635 --> 52:53.836
How could I forget something
like that?

52:53.838 --> 52:57.673
It was an act of mercy.

52:57.675 --> 53:03.245
I can't remember anything
about any of them.

53:08.585 --> 53:13.389
Well, your pa was
a hell of a dancer.

53:13.391 --> 53:14.423
Hard worker.

53:14.425 --> 53:14.423
He was funny.

53:17.961 --> 53:20.863
He was kind when he wanted
to be.

53:20.865 --> 53:25.935
I mean, he had a temper, sure,
same as anyone.

53:25.937 --> 53:27.970
I don't know what else
to tell you.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.276
Thanks.

53:43.753 --> 53:44.787
Morning, mommy.

53:47.390 --> 53:50.226
You look really tired.

53:50.228 --> 53:51.694
Thanks.

53:51.696 --> 53:54.330
Can we go to the lake
and skip stones?

53:54.332 --> 53:55.864
I don't know, monkey.

53:55.866 --> 53:58.434
Please? Pretty please?

53:58.436 --> 54:00.002
Maybe later, ok?

54:00.004 --> 54:00.002
<i> Fine.</i>

54:00.004 --> 54:04.707
<i> I'm sorry if Suzie kept you</i>
<i> awake last night.</i>

54:06.876 --> 54:08.577
What'd you just say?

54:08.579 --> 54:10.813
<i> Morning.</i>

54:10.815 --> 54:12.548
My two favourite ladies.

54:14.417 --> 54:15.451
How're we feeling?

54:15.453 --> 54:17.019
Great.

54:19.323 --> 54:21.357
Can you take her
to the lake?

54:22.792 --> 54:23.859
You ok?

54:26.596 --> 54:31.000
I wanna head back today.

54:31.002 --> 54:32.968
I'm not feeling so good.

54:32.970 --> 54:35.704
Tell me what's up.

54:35.706 --> 54:38.741
I think this place is making
me worse.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.679
We'll go home after lunch.

54:44.814 --> 54:46.749
Who wants to skip
some stones?

54:46.751 --> 54:47.783
I do!

56:37.794 --> 56:39.795
Are there any bears
in these woods?

56:39.797 --> 56:40.863
No.

56:40.865 --> 56:42.598
They live further north.

56:43.767 --> 56:45.534
What about wolves?

56:46.569 --> 56:48.637
Well, you never know.

56:52.008 --> 56:53.041
Hello?

56:55.712 --> 56:56.779
Suzie?

57:41.991 --> 57:43.559
What about fairies?

57:43.561 --> 57:45.961
Would any fairies live
down here?

57:45.963 --> 57:47.062
I don't know.

57:47.064 --> 57:48.897
Well, you never can tell.

57:48.899 --> 57:51.166
Fairies are tricksters.

57:51.168 --> 57:53.068
Tinkerbell wasn't a trickster.

57:53.070 --> 57:54.903
Yeah, that's different.

57:54.905 --> 57:57.606
She wasn't real.

57:57.608 --> 57:58.807
I see.

57:58.809 --> 58:00.843
So real fairies are tricksters.

58:00.845 --> 58:02.578
Yeah, they're good.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.513
They tell us riddles.

58:04.515 --> 58:05.781
You have to listen carefully

58:05.783 --> 58:08.717
because your eyes
are easily tricked.

58:38.047 --> 58:40.549
<i> Stupid.</i>

58:40.551 --> 58:41.583
Suzie?

58:41.585 --> 58:43.852
<i> You shouldn't be here.</i>

58:56.032 --> 58:57.533
I know it's you.

59:07.577 --> 59:10.045
Please don't hide.

59:10.047 --> 59:11.747
We have to.

59:11.749 --> 59:13.582
The monster's coming.

59:15.586 --> 59:17.252
Hide!

59:18.254 --> 59:19.721
Hide!

59:23.059 --> 59:24.893
Shh!

59:37.341 --> 59:39.641
You have to run!

59:39.643 --> 59:40.809
I can't!

59:40.811 --> 59:41.810
Run!

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:23.151
How do you know so much
about fairies?

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:24.886
I had a dream about it.

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:26.888
This nice lady taught me
a song.

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:27.956
She did?

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.024
Yeah.

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:31.293
She also said mommy's
gonna hurt me.

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:35.130
Honey, why would you say that?

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.002
Did mommy do something?

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:43.338
Mommy's not the real one
to be afraid of.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.707
Then who is?

01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:47.976
The monster in the bedroom.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.691
I'm going to start loading
the car.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:53.408
<i> Alice!</i>

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:55.844
<i> Alice!</i>

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:57.713
<i> Alice.</i>

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:06.922
Alice.

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:09.191
Alice.

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.930
We can't let you leave, janey.

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:16.264
We can't.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:17.833
What are you doing?

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:22.370
Looking for you.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:24.906
But I'm right here.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.374
Were you singing?

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:27.809
The fairy song.

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:29.010
Where'd you hear it?

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:31.213
I don't know.

01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:32.247
This is important.

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.151
Where'd you hear that song?

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:36.852
I don't know.

01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:38.386
Of course you do!

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:40.822
Now you tell me
where you heard it!

01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:41.289
I don't know-

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.124
Alice!

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:43.358
Hey!

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:47.295
Hey, what are you doing?

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:53.502
What the fuck?

01:02:53.504 --> 01:02:54.436
It's nothing.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:56.071
You were hurting her.

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:57.072
It was an accident.

01:02:57.074 --> 01:02:57.906
Don't bullshit me, Jane!

01:02:57.908 --> 01:02:58.507
She was driving me nuts.

01:02:58.509 --> 01:02:59.508
I just want to go!

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:00.976
Listen!

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.383
Come on.

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:09.284
No, no, no.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:10.352
Jane.

01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:11.953
You didn't.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.523
Didn't what, Alan?

01:03:14.525 --> 01:03:16.992
Tell me you didn't.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.168
Of course I didn't.

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:27.169
I swear.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.905
<i> Daddy!</i>

01:03:29.907 --> 01:03:31.573
<i> Daddy!</i>

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.210
Alice!

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:35.877
Alice?

01:03:35.879 --> 01:03:37.913
Alice!

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:38.914
What happened?

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.081
The man was chasing me.

01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:41.049
What man?

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:42.317
We had to hide.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.385
She must have imagined it.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:45.086
What man?

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:46.421
The monster under the bed.

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:47.122
Alright, sweetie.

01:03:47.124 --> 01:03:47.956
Just-

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:52.093
oh god, Ali.

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:53.128
Ali, look.

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:54.095
Let me look.

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:54.596
Ok, relax.

01:03:54.598 --> 01:03:55.497
Relax.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:57.098
Just relax, relax, relax.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.134
She's having an asthma attack.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.204
What do you mean?

01:04:02.206 --> 01:04:04.272
Just like my sister.

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:08.210
We gotta go.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.578
Come on.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.014
Hang on, sweetie. Hang on.

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:17.519
Goddammit.

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.428
It won't open.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:34.202
Jane.

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:38.139
They won't let me leave.

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:45.313
Go.

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:55.190
Jane!

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:58.960
Get her out of here!

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:22.303
Ok.

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:24.606
Let's play.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:22.596
Olly olly oxen free.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.546
I know you.

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:58.393
Psst. Quickly.
You've gotta hide.

01:09:58.395 --> 01:09:59.427
He's coming!

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:03.798
You've gotta hide!

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.633
Hide, janey!

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:23.952
Shhh. It's him.

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:52.680
Shhh.

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:55.617
Pretty girl.

01:10:56.852 --> 01:11:00.355
You shouldn't be here.

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:02.724
Of course I should.

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:06.027
I even brought a present
for you.

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.744
Stay away from me.

01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:42.930
Janey?

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:51.939
I'm not the monster.

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:52.974
He is.

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:00.315
Shhh.

01:12:00.317 --> 01:12:01.416
Pretty girl.

01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:03.084
You shouldn't be here.

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:06.421
Of course I should.

01:12:06.423 --> 01:12:08.823
Just listen to the fairy song
and everything will be alright.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.616
I'm fine.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:41.389
Liam, let's go up.

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:42.423
Liam.

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:44.459
Liam.

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:46.394
Come on, let's go up.

01:12:46.396 --> 01:12:47.628
Mommy?

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:48.663
No, no.

01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:51.466
<i> Mommy!!</i>

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:00.541
Sweetheart, no.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:00.541
No. Shh.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:03.444
I need you to be quiet.
I need you to be quiet.

01:13:03.446 --> 01:13:04.612
It'll be fine, just shhh.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.013
Quiet.

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:07.148
Stop it!

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.383
Stop it!

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:12.019
You get away from her.

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:14.489
Jenny, wait.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:15.656
Liam! Liam!

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:16.691
Wait, Jenny!
No, no, no!

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:17.692
Don't call him!

01:13:17.694 --> 01:13:18.893
Don't call him.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.562
Wait, wait, wait.

01:13:52.462 --> 01:13:54.829
Kiddo.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.630
Christ!

01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:25.059
The brain is a remarkable thing.

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:28.095
It can re-wire itself,
repair itself.

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:30.131
Even create false memories
to protect us.

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:33.200
Very good.

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:37.004
I barely remember
my own family.

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:39.039
I never put much stock
in what they print, anyway.

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.313
Where are you?

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:54.355
Daddy?

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:07.134
You should have
just told me.

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:09.904
Babe, we're trapped here.

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:11.172
I can only guide you
to the truth

01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:13.207
and you can set us free.

01:20:31.961 --> 01:20:32.993
I'm sorry.

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:36.831
Don't be.

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:40.401
Don't be. We love you.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:46.841
Hey. Are you alright?

01:20:46.843 --> 01:20:47.575
Hey.

01:20:47.577 --> 01:20:48.375
Alice.

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:49.443
Alice is fine.

01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:51.545
She calmed down
once we hit the road.

01:20:51.547 --> 01:20:59.620
Alan, I... it's going
to be better now.

01:20:59.622 --> 01:21:03.591
I promise.

01:21:03.593 --> 01:21:06.260
Let's just change that tire
and get out of here.

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:14.134
Where's Alice?

01:21:14.136 --> 01:21:16.904
I dropped her off at Patrick's.

01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:17.938
What?

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.907
Jane!

01:21:19.909 --> 01:21:21.342
Hey, what's going on?!

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:34.355
Yeah, put your hands
on some cookies.

01:21:34.357 --> 01:21:36.390
What's that you got there?

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.096
I didn't know kids still played
with Jacks anymore.

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:48.602
You sure were excited when we
played with those cows.

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:49.637
You wanna do that again?

01:21:49.639 --> 01:21:51.138
Moo cow!

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:51.906
We can do that again.

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:58.479
I might need a favour first,
though.

01:21:58.481 --> 01:22:00.314
Like what?

01:22:00.316 --> 01:22:03.417
Well, it'd have to be
our secret.

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:07.154
Can you keep a secret?

01:22:07.156 --> 01:22:10.224
It's nothing much,
just a game.

01:22:10.226 --> 01:22:12.927
They told me not to play
with you.

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:15.562
Who did?

01:22:15.564 --> 01:22:16.597
No one.

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:23.203
Who would say something
mean like that?

01:22:23.205 --> 01:22:24.238
I don't know.

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:27.074
Yes, you do.

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:32.379
I just want to know what
they've been saying to you.

01:22:41.022 --> 01:22:44.058
Looks like they've said too
much already.

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:48.996
Let's go. Come on.

01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:50.698
Let's go.

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:58.505
Hey!

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:06.113
They're so silly.

01:23:06.115 --> 01:23:07.147
Indeed.

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:10.184
Come on now.

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:12.252
You really need that?

01:23:12.254 --> 01:23:14.088
A lot of foxes, Suzie.

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:15.689
Foxes everywhere.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:18.425
Alice, not Suzie.

01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:19.126
Yeah.

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:20.194
Patrick.

01:23:21.197 --> 01:23:23.263
Hey!

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:23.998
Patrick!

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:24.698
Keep your distance.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:25.766
Patrick, don't shoot!

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:25.766
Please, don't shoot!

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:28.102
Don't shoot.

01:23:28.104 --> 01:23:30.070
I wanna go home!

01:23:30.072 --> 01:23:30.604
Patrick!

01:23:30.606 --> 01:23:31.538
Patrick.

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.107
I wanna go home!

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:36.710
It's ok, sweetie. It's ok.

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:39.413
Everything's gonna be alright.

01:23:39.415 --> 01:23:40.547
Please, Patrick.

01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:42.116
Don't hurt her.

01:23:42.118 --> 01:23:45.519
Please.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.554
Tell me what you want,
Patrick.

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.625
A second chance.

01:23:51.627 --> 01:23:52.659
Daddy!

01:24:33.069 --> 01:24:34.835
<i> Hey. Hey.</i>

01:24:36.771 --> 01:24:37.805
<i> Hey.</i>

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:41.108
<i> Hey.</i>

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:45.479
You can't leave me here.

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:46.246
<i> No, stop!</i>

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:48.082
<i> You can't!</i>

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:52.386
Jane!

01:24:52.388 --> 01:24:54.421
I- I never meant...

01:24:58.159 --> 01:25:00.494
I loved your sister,
i just- we're family.

01:25:00.496 --> 01:25:01.528
It was a mistake.

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:04.465
Tell that to them.

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:09.203
No!

01:25:09.205 --> 01:25:10.537
No!

01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:24.718
<i> Jane!</i>

01:25:30.526 --> 01:25:32.526
<i> I'm sorry!</i>

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:51.578
Jane!

01:26:20.176 --> 01:26:22.609
Are there dead people
in there?

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:24.244
Yes, honey.

01:26:24.246 --> 01:26:25.712
Eww.

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:27.281
Come on, let's go play
by the woods.

01:26:27.283 --> 01:26:28.782
See if there's any bears
in there.

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:30.951
You said they lived
further north!

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.278
