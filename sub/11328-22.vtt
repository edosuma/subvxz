<i>Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.891 --> 00:04.658
- Are you coming back?
- I don't think so.

00:04.693 --> 00:06.226
Leo's got people
looking for you.

00:06.261 --> 00:09.930
No one knows if Ricky left
because I had sex with Ben,

00:09.964 --> 00:12.232
or because he just doesn't want
to be the father of Amy's baby.

00:12.267 --> 00:13.934
I wouldn't mind
having John to myself

00:13.968 --> 00:15.536
and not having
to share him with Ricky.

00:15.570 --> 00:18.005
- You haven't talked to Ricky since
he left? - Why would he talk to me?

00:18.039 --> 00:21.675
You might want to get
closer to your family.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.944
If that means getting to know
Jeff and being nicer to him,

00:23.978 --> 00:26.714
I'm already doing that. It's
called reverse psychology.

00:26.748 --> 00:30.217
- Did your dad find him? - He called his
parents, so wherever he is, he's okay.

00:30.251 --> 00:31.919
Ben had sex with Adrian.

00:31.953 --> 00:34.555
- Do you want to be together
with Ben? - I don't know.

00:34.589 --> 00:36.790
We hope you get married
soon and you're together

00:36.825 --> 00:38.625
and happy for
the rest of your lives.

00:38.660 --> 00:40.427
- How about tonight?
- Tonight?

00:40.462 --> 00:41.562
I need a few more days.

00:41.596 --> 00:43.130
This is my dream too,
you know.

00:43.164 --> 00:45.232
How many dreams
do I have to give up?

00:45.266 --> 00:47.301
If you're tired
of sleeping on the couch,

00:47.335 --> 00:49.636
and you want to sleep
in the bedroom, you can.

00:49.671 --> 00:50.871
Take off the baseball cap.

00:52.807 --> 00:54.041
I know where Ricky is.

00:55.176 --> 00:56.243
I want to move forward.

00:56.277 --> 00:57.745
Move forward or run away?

01:04.285 --> 01:05.953
Hey, there you are.

01:05.987 --> 01:07.821
How are you?

01:07.856 --> 01:11.091
I had my security guys
find you.

01:11.126 --> 01:12.893
I wanted to talk to you.
You mind?

01:12.927 --> 01:14.428
I guess not.

01:15.430 --> 01:17.931
I mean, of course not.

01:17.966 --> 01:19.633
I'm sorry I left
without saying goodbye.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.101
To you, anyway.

01:21.136 --> 01:23.270
I was in a hurry
to get out of there,

01:23.304 --> 01:25.739
and I'm not good at goodbyes.

01:25.774 --> 01:27.975
I know what you're
talking about. Me, neither.

01:28.009 --> 01:30.978
Ever since my wife died,
I've had that problem.

01:31.012 --> 01:34.281
It's just that Amy and John
would be better off without me.

01:34.315 --> 01:36.417
So would Adrian. So would
Ben, for that matter.

01:36.451 --> 01:38.452
Don't you mean you'll be
better off without them?

01:38.486 --> 01:40.954
Who am I to be better off
without anyone?

01:40.989 --> 01:42.923
No. They're better off
without me.

01:42.957 --> 01:43.957
And why's that?

01:43.992 --> 01:45.092
Because I'm me.

01:45.126 --> 01:46.360
And who are you?

01:46.394 --> 01:48.362
That's a good question.

01:48.396 --> 01:49.463
What are you thinking?

01:49.497 --> 01:51.298
That because you come
from this dark past

01:51.332 --> 01:52.966
you had no control over,

01:53.001 --> 01:55.302
that you have no right
to feel angry at anyone,

01:55.336 --> 01:57.671
because everyone
is better than you?

01:57.705 --> 01:59.773
You have a right to feel
however you feel,

01:59.808 --> 02:02.075
but I think you should
let people know how you feel

02:02.110 --> 02:04.812
if they did something or said
something that made you take off.

02:04.846 --> 02:06.780
Then maybe you have a shot
at working it out.

02:06.815 --> 02:09.917
Maybe there's a better solution
than for you to leave.

02:09.951 --> 02:11.351
But I don't know
what your problem is.

02:11.386 --> 02:13.954
The problem is me
and my anger

02:13.988 --> 02:15.522
and what to do
when I'm angry.

02:15.557 --> 02:19.726
I'm trying not to be angry.
I'm just tired of being angry.

02:19.761 --> 02:21.695
If you're angry, you're angry.
Are you angry at Amy?

02:21.729 --> 02:23.931
Yeah, I'm angry at Amy.

02:23.965 --> 02:25.432
I wish I wasn't, but I am.

02:25.467 --> 02:26.533
Well, then say something.

02:26.568 --> 02:29.136
Talk to her. Talk to Adrian.
Talk to Ben.

02:29.170 --> 02:31.805
And say what? You want me
to tell you what to say?

02:31.840 --> 02:33.507
I wish someone
would tell me what to say.

02:33.541 --> 02:35.476
Well, I highly recommend
the truth.

02:35.510 --> 02:38.312
No one really ever
tells the truth, do they?

02:38.346 --> 02:41.849
Yeah, some people do.
Like me, for example.

02:41.883 --> 02:43.717
Go ahead.
All right, I will.

02:43.751 --> 02:46.620
Think about what
you're doing here, Ricky.

02:46.654 --> 02:48.789
Is it best for you to take off
and leave your son?

02:48.823 --> 02:51.291
Is it better for both of you,
you and your son,

02:51.326 --> 02:53.293
if you just stop
fooling around

02:53.328 --> 02:55.295
every time you get
an opportunity

02:55.330 --> 02:56.630
and get serious about yourself

02:56.664 --> 02:58.332
and who you're going to be
in life?

02:58.366 --> 03:01.235
You have a son, so you're
going to have to grow up

03:01.269 --> 03:03.070
if you want to be
a good father.

03:03.104 --> 03:04.538
And you can't be a good father

03:04.572 --> 03:06.406
without being a good person
and an honorable man.

03:06.441 --> 03:09.543
You've come a long way, but
you've got a long way to go.

03:09.577 --> 03:12.913
Think what you want about me
for saying that to you,

03:12.947 --> 03:14.581
but I felt
compelled to say it.

03:14.616 --> 03:16.884
Kids your age and Ben's age,

03:16.918 --> 03:18.919
you don't like anyone getting
in your face like this.

03:18.953 --> 03:22.256
You'd rather spend time
saying useless crap

03:22.290 --> 03:24.892
in text messages
and all that Internet stuff,

03:24.926 --> 03:27.928
where people are
anonymous and irresponsible

03:27.962 --> 03:29.596
and avoid direct confrontation.

03:29.631 --> 03:32.599
Well, that's not my style.
That's not me.

03:32.634 --> 03:36.570
So I'm telling to your face what I
think, in my opinion, what the truth is.

03:36.604 --> 03:41.108
And I'm telling you all this
because I care about you,

03:41.142 --> 03:42.776
and I want you to go home.

03:42.810 --> 03:46.280
Now here, take the keys
to the apartment.

03:46.314 --> 03:50.884
It's there for you whether you come
back tonight or next week or next year.

03:50.919 --> 03:52.786
Because I know you, Ricky.

03:52.820 --> 03:55.289
Sooner or later, you're
going to do the right thing.

03:55.323 --> 03:56.757
I really believe that.

03:58.259 --> 04:00.928
Just try to make it
sooner rather than later, huh?

Who comes to see anyone
at this time the morning?

04:45.974 --> 04:48.976
Good morning. Could you give me
a couple minutes of your time?

04:49.010 --> 04:50.677
What? Are you selling something?

04:51.980 --> 04:53.347
I just want to apologize.

04:53.381 --> 04:54.948
It's 6:30 in the morning.

04:54.983 --> 04:57.618
I know. My dad told me
you came back last night,

04:57.652 --> 04:59.119
but I wasn't sure
if you'd stick around,

04:59.153 --> 05:01.488
so I wanted to make sure I talked
to you. I've been calling you.

05:01.522 --> 05:04.091
Everyone's been calling me.

05:04.125 --> 05:05.626
Please, could I come in?

05:07.161 --> 05:09.896
Thank you.
I really appreciate this.

05:09.931 --> 05:12.232
We don't have to do this.

05:12.266 --> 05:13.400
I have to do this.

05:13.434 --> 05:15.802
Because your dad's
making you do this?

05:15.837 --> 05:18.538
No. Please, just let me do
this. Let me apologize for...

05:18.573 --> 05:21.908
Don't say what you did,
and don't say her name.

05:21.943 --> 05:24.678
If you do, it's going to feel
like you're rubbing it in my face.

05:24.712 --> 05:28.248
Then allow me to say that I
don't feel good about what I did,

05:28.282 --> 05:30.150
and I'm sorry I betrayed
your friendship.

05:30.184 --> 05:31.918
Are you?

05:31.953 --> 05:36.923
Kind of. But we weren't
really friends, were we?

05:36.958 --> 05:39.593
We were just trying
to be friends for John's sake.

05:39.627 --> 05:42.796
And then without Amy,
without John,

05:42.830 --> 05:45.265
I really had no reason
to try to be friends with you,

05:45.299 --> 05:47.034
and I didn't have
a reason not...

05:47.068 --> 05:48.435
Don't say it.

05:48.469 --> 05:50.771
I won't say it, but I will say
that I really resent

05:50.805 --> 05:53.707
your having sex with Amy, and
I've been angry about it all along.

05:53.741 --> 05:55.142
I've been angry with Amy, too,

05:55.176 --> 05:58.645
and I guess all that unaddressed
anger just spilled over into...

05:58.680 --> 05:59.713
Watch it.
...Adrian.

05:59.747 --> 06:02.282
I told you not to say her name.

06:02.316 --> 06:06.253
Yeah, or that we had sex,
but I said it.

06:06.287 --> 06:07.721
So why don't you just hit me?

06:07.755 --> 06:09.589
What are you talking about?

06:09.624 --> 06:14.695
I would feel like justice
has been served if you hit me,

06:14.729 --> 06:16.563
and that would give me
the opportunity to hit you.

06:16.597 --> 06:20.133
It's not my business to
dispense justice or yours,

06:20.168 --> 06:21.368
and for yournformation,

06:21.402 --> 06:22.769
not everyone gets
what they deserve.

06:22.804 --> 06:25.405
You just get what you get,
you and me and everyone else.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.641
Life's not fair.
Get used to it.

06:27.675 --> 06:30.110
I'm not going to hit you, and
you are not going to hit me.

06:30.144 --> 06:32.412
I might. If you hit me,
then I might hit you back,

06:32.447 --> 06:35.148
and if I hit you back, I might just keep
hitting you until you get really hurt.

06:35.183 --> 06:36.683
It hurts to get hit.

06:36.718 --> 06:38.785
It's not like in the movies.
It actually hurts.

06:38.820 --> 06:42.856
Then fine, don't hit me.

06:42.890 --> 06:45.425
I don't really want
to get hurt.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.728
I want you to get hurt.

06:47.762 --> 06:51.331
You've wrecked my whole life,
you know that?

06:51.365 --> 06:54.267
You got the one girl
I really love pregnant,

06:54.302 --> 06:56.403
the girl I wanted to be with
for the rest of my life,

06:56.437 --> 06:57.971
the girl I would've married
and had children with

06:58.005 --> 06:59.439
if it weren't for you.

06:59.474 --> 07:00.507
I want to clobber you.

07:00.541 --> 07:02.375
No one's hitting anyone.
You got that?

07:02.410 --> 07:04.044
No, I really don't got that.

07:04.078 --> 07:05.746
I thought you came here
to apologize.

07:05.780 --> 07:07.280
I did co here to apologize...

07:09.250 --> 07:10.851
but now that I'm here...

07:12.019 --> 07:14.721
I think I broke my hand.

07:14.756 --> 07:16.890
Move your fingers.
Can you move your fingers?

07:16.924 --> 07:18.458
Barely.

07:18.493 --> 07:20.460
Then it's not broken.
Going to get you some ice.

07:20.495 --> 07:22.796
No, don't get me some ice.

07:22.830 --> 07:23.964
I'm trying to hurt you

07:23.998 --> 07:25.499
the way I wish
I had tried to hurt you

07:25.533 --> 07:28.168
instead of doing what I did.

07:28.202 --> 07:30.036
Don't ever hit a guy
who's just told you

07:30.071 --> 07:31.571
he's been hit all his life,
okay?

07:31.606 --> 07:34.708
Don't ever hit anyone.
That includes me.

07:34.742 --> 07:37.611
If you hit me again,
I swear I'm going to hit you.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.317
That really hurt.

07:44.352 --> 07:46.920
Oh, God...
Okay, don't do that again.

07:46.954 --> 07:48.455
You don't need
to prove your point.

07:48.489 --> 07:50.724
That won't be necessary.
I'm not going to do it again.

07:50.758 --> 07:52.726
But you said if you hit me
once, you'd keep hitting me.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.361
Don't keep hitting me.
I thought I would.

07:54.395 --> 07:56.329
But you're not going to?
No, I don't feel like it.

07:56.364 --> 07:57.798
Sit down before you faint
or something.

07:57.832 --> 08:01.735
I'm not going to faint.

08:03.538 --> 08:06.506
But thank you
for not hitting me again,

08:06.541 --> 08:10.310
But you did hit me harder
than I hit you.

08:10.344 --> 08:13.079
Meaning? Meaning you still
owe me a punch or something?

08:13.114 --> 08:16.683
Didn't you learn anything?
Hitting doesn't solve anything.

08:16.717 --> 08:17.951
All right,
so what do we do now?

08:17.985 --> 08:19.019
I don't know
what you're going to do,

08:19.053 --> 08:21.388
but I'm going to go see
John and Amy

08:21.422 --> 08:22.989
and Adrian,
and then I'm leaving.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.158
I want to get away.
I thought you just did that.

08:25.193 --> 08:27.727
I did, but evidently
I didn't do it the right way,

08:27.762 --> 08:30.096
so I've come back to say
what I want to say,

08:30.131 --> 08:31.665
and then I'm taking off.

08:31.699 --> 08:32.999
I don't guess
I could come with you.

08:35.001 --> 08:37.571
Can you come with me?
You just punched me.

08:37.605 --> 08:40.373
Yeah, I know,
but I had to do it.

08:40.408 --> 08:42.741
I just couldn't quit thinking
about it. I just had to do it.

08:42.777 --> 08:44.544
No, you didn't just have
to do it.

08:44.579 --> 08:45.879
And no, you can't come
with me.

08:45.913 --> 08:47.314
You get obsessed
with things, you know?

08:47.348 --> 08:49.082
You're like
a little kid sometimes

08:49.116 --> 08:50.851
when you just gotta gotta
gotta have something,

08:50.885 --> 08:52.252
and you can't quit thinking
about it.

08:52.286 --> 08:53.486
You just want it.

08:53.521 --> 08:54.721
I do that, yes.

08:56.123 --> 08:59.392
I'll get you some ice.

08:59.427 --> 09:01.628
Who you going to talk
to first, Amy or Adrian?

09:01.662 --> 09:03.630
You're going to come here
at 6:30 in the morning

09:03.664 --> 09:06.233
and punch me and then get
into my business?

09:06.267 --> 09:09.269
It's my business, too.
What is this?

09:09.303 --> 09:12.005
It's Boo Boo Man,
something I keep for John.

09:12.039 --> 09:13.340
How is it your business?

09:13.374 --> 09:16.209
Because it involves Amy,
and I still love Amy.

09:16.244 --> 09:17.844
I don't know who I'm going to
talk to first.

09:17.879 --> 09:19.112
I just think
that if you talk...

09:19.146 --> 09:22.215
No, I don't want you to weigh
in on this, all right?

09:22.250 --> 09:25.352
Wait, who would you suggest
I talk to first,

09:25.386 --> 09:27.554
the woman you love
or the woman you were with?

09:27.588 --> 09:31.691
Who do you think it should be, the woman
you love or the woman you were with?

09:31.726 --> 09:33.293
Look, she did this on purpose,

09:33.327 --> 09:36.663
you know, Adrian putting the two
of us in this parallel situation.

09:36.697 --> 09:38.498
That's why she did
what she did with you.

09:38.532 --> 09:39.933
Or she did what she did
with me

09:39.967 --> 09:42.068
because we both wanted
to do what we did.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.937
Which was get back at Amy
and me.

09:43.971 --> 09:45.972
But it just wasn't
that there was ulterior motive.

09:46.007 --> 09:48.808
It wasn't just sex for the sake
of getting back at Amy and you.

09:48.843 --> 09:50.310
Jeez, Ben, yes it was.

09:50.344 --> 09:52.145
You might not have been
thinking that far ahead,

09:52.179 --> 09:53.413
but I'm sure Adrian was.

09:53.447 --> 09:54.648
Come on, you were, too.

09:54.682 --> 09:55.782
All right, all right,

09:55.816 --> 09:58.652
it's just that
I've tried to justify it

09:58.686 --> 09:59.819
a dozen different ways,

09:59.854 --> 10:03.556
and I guess
there is no justification.

10:03.591 --> 10:06.459
That's more like it.
I accept your apology.

10:06.494 --> 10:08.595
No, that wasn't an apology,

10:08.629 --> 10:10.764
and even if it was,
why would you accept it?

10:10.798 --> 10:13.500
Because as lousy as it is,
worse things have happened to me.

10:13.534 --> 10:15.902
I guess they have.
Yeah, they have.

10:15.937 --> 10:17.737
I'm sorry that I hit you,

10:17.772 --> 10:23.677
and I know you've been through
more than most people, including me,

10:23.711 --> 10:26.746
but still, if you wanted
to apologize to me, too...

10:26.781 --> 10:29.849
I don't. I didn't do anything
to intentionally hurt you,

10:29.884 --> 10:32.552
and I didn't do anything to
Amy to intentionally hurt her.

10:32.586 --> 10:34.521
We did what we did
at band camp

10:34.555 --> 10:36.589
without any intention
of hurting anyone else.

10:36.624 --> 10:38.591
Of course in the proce
we did,

10:38.626 --> 10:40.226
but we didn't do it
on purpose.

10:40.261 --> 10:41.561
What about
when you kissed her?

10:41.595 --> 10:44.497
What about when I kissed her?
It was just a kiss.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.768
Okay, it wasn't.

10:48.803 --> 10:49.903
I apologize for the kiss.

10:49.937 --> 10:51.304
Thank you.

10:51.339 --> 10:53.840
Let's just call it even,
all right?

10:53.874 --> 10:55.608
Even?

10:55.643 --> 10:58.445
Unless Adrian has my baby,
we're not even.

10:58.479 --> 11:00.280
Oh, jeez,
why did you have to say that?

11:00.314 --> 11:01.781
Because I was thinking it?

11:03.851 --> 11:06.019
I'm never going to have sex
with Adrian again.

11:06.053 --> 11:07.087
All right.

11:07.121 --> 11:09.556
And you're never going
to have...

11:09.590 --> 11:12.959
I'm going to have sex with
whoever I want to have sex with.

11:12.994 --> 11:14.127
Ben, listen to me.

11:14.161 --> 11:15.695
You and Amy are over,

11:15.730 --> 11:18.865
and that has nothing to do with
me and everything to do with you.

11:18.899 --> 11:21.768
Amy's not going to forgive you
for what happened, you or Adrian.

11:21.802 --> 11:22.902
She's just not.

11:22.937 --> 11:25.205
I know that because
she's never forgiven me

11:25.239 --> 11:26.906
even though she was
a willing participant

11:26.941 --> 11:28.341
and equally responsible.

11:28.376 --> 11:30.944
Never? Never
going to forgive me?

11:30.978 --> 11:32.846
I don't know about that.
Maybe some day.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.648
Never. I'm telling you this as a friend.

11:35.683 --> 11:38.118
You sure you're not telling me this
as someone who wants Amy for himself?

11:38.152 --> 11:40.153
Yeah, I'm sure.

11:41.922 --> 11:43.823
Who is it?

11:43.858 --> 11:44.991
It's your mother.

11:45.026 --> 11:46.926
And your father.
May we come in?

11:46.961 --> 11:49.596
I'll talk to you
after school.

11:49.630 --> 11:50.897
Hi.

11:50.931 --> 11:53.166
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm Ben.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.202
Hi, I'm Margaret.
I'm Ricky's mother,

11:56.237 --> 11:58.238
and this is my husband,
Ricky's father.

11:58.272 --> 11:59.639
He goes by Shaker.

11:59.673 --> 12:02.275
Nice to meet you guys.
Uh, I'll just see you around.

12:04.512 --> 12:06.279
Come in.

12:12.219 --> 12:14.687
Come in, have a seat.
Sorry the place is a mess.

12:14.722 --> 12:17.290
I haven't had time
to straighten up yet.

12:17.324 --> 12:19.359
Have you had a chance
to see John yet?

12:19.393 --> 12:20.860
No, I'll try to do that
tonight,

12:20.895 --> 12:22.695
but I have to talk
to Amy first.

12:22.730 --> 12:27.167
We are so happy you came back.

12:27.201 --> 12:29.669
And we want to make sure
you stay around,

12:29.703 --> 12:31.805
let you have more of a reason
to stay around.

12:31.839 --> 12:33.239
What do you mean?

12:33.274 --> 12:36.676
Well, we haven't been very
involved as grandparents,

12:36.710 --> 12:39.646
and we want to be
more involved.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.615
That way you can be more
involved in your son's life.

12:42.650 --> 12:44.451
What's going on?

12:54.182 --> 12:56.817
When is it going to stop?

12:56.851 --> 12:59.820
When are we going to get
some sleep?

12:59.854 --> 13:02.489
They are driving me crazy.

13:02.524 --> 13:07.595
Can any honeymoon at home
be that much fun?

13:07.629 --> 13:09.897
What?
Where did you get those?

13:09.931 --> 13:12.199
At med camp. If you're
going to be a doctor,

13:12.233 --> 13:13.767
you have to learn
how to get some sleep.

13:13.802 --> 13:15.569
Thanks for sharing.

13:15.604 --> 13:17.071
Morning, guys.

13:17.105 --> 13:18.305
Anybody want some coffee?

13:18.340 --> 13:23.410
We all have coffee.
Someone keep us awake.

13:23.445 --> 13:28.849
Last night, giggling,
laughing, having a good time.

13:28.883 --> 13:30.618
Thank you.
That was your mother.

13:30.652 --> 13:33.354
Oh, the same mother that was
married to our father, that one?

13:33.388 --> 13:34.788
That's the one.

13:37.092 --> 13:39.126
Hey, Tom, can I talk
to Grace alone,

13:39.160 --> 13:40.561
just a couple minutes?

13:40.595 --> 13:42.997
Be my guest.
Bye.

13:45.634 --> 13:48.268
Let's talk.

13:48.303 --> 13:51.071
Kind of get the feeling that we're
getting off to a bad start here,

13:51.106 --> 13:53.140
so the sooner we talk,
the better.

13:53.174 --> 13:55.009
I'm sure you're
kind of uncomfortable

13:55.043 --> 13:56.677
having me in the house,
and to tell you the truth,

13:56.711 --> 13:58.212
I'm a little uncomfortable
myself,

13:58.246 --> 14:01.015
but you don't want to move,
do you?

14:01.049 --> 14:02.883
I mean, not you.
All of us.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.184
You don't think
we should move.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.285
No.

14:05.320 --> 14:08.055
No. I figured you didn't,

14:08.089 --> 14:10.290
so what's going on?

14:10.325 --> 14:12.192
You didn't really want us
to get married, did you?

14:12.227 --> 14:13.927
Not really.

14:13.962 --> 14:15.462
A little reverse psychology,
huh?

14:15.497 --> 14:16.530
Kind of.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.232
Doesn't always work.
No kidding.

14:18.266 --> 14:20.734
Look, your mom's been
through a lot?

14:20.769 --> 14:22.503
Don't you want her to have
some fun in life?

14:22.537 --> 14:25.939
Yeah, I just think it's a little soon
for her to be having this much fun,

14:25.974 --> 14:27.141
and you, too,
for that matter.

14:27.175 --> 14:29.009
And by fun, you mean...
Sex.

14:30.345 --> 14:32.312
Well, we're married.

14:32.347 --> 14:34.314
You do believe that it's okay
for two people to have fun

14:34.349 --> 14:35.349
once they're married, right?

14:35.383 --> 14:36.483
No, not always.

14:36.518 --> 14:38.052
You're not married.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.987
Never even been engaged.
You've had fun.

14:40.021 --> 14:41.622
Yes, but I'm never having
fun again

14:41.656 --> 14:44.792
because I'm not married or
engaged, and it's just wrong.

14:44.826 --> 14:46.126
Even if two people agree
to have fun

14:46.161 --> 14:48.062
and be responsible
and do all the right things

14:48.096 --> 14:50.264
like using birth control
and a condom.

14:50.298 --> 14:51.865
Even if.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.567
Your mom seems to think
that you're flip-flopping

14:53.601 --> 14:55.402
on the issue of having fun
before marriage.

14:55.437 --> 14:59.106
Maybe, but the important thing
now is that I have landed.

14:59.140 --> 15:00.374
I'm being good.

15:00.408 --> 15:01.909
You're not talking
about being good-fun.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.377
You're talking
about being a good girl.

15:03.411 --> 15:04.378
Am I right?
Yes.

15:04.412 --> 15:05.479
Okay, so there's

15:05.513 --> 15:06.780
a lot of good girls
just like you

15:06.815 --> 15:08.048
that have fun in high school

15:08.083 --> 15:09.116
even though they think
they really shouldn't.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.551
Oh, do they?
Yes, they do.

15:10.585 --> 15:13.153
They lack the courage to stand
up for what they believe in

15:13.188 --> 15:14.588
because there might be
opposing viewpoints,

15:14.622 --> 15:15.756
and that leads to conflict,

15:15.790 --> 15:17.491
and good girls
do not like conflict,

15:17.525 --> 15:18.692
so they usually talk themselves

15:18.727 --> 15:19.793
into going along
with the crowd.

15:19.828 --> 15:22.129
Is that so?
That is so.

15:22.163 --> 15:24.965
So that continues on in life,

15:24.999 --> 15:29.336
a good girl's inability to stand
up for what she believes in.

15:29.370 --> 15:30.904
Good girls need
to gain approval

15:30.939 --> 15:33.907
and attention
and avoid conflict,

15:33.942 --> 15:36.176
so as she leaves high school,
goes into college

15:36.211 --> 15:39.680
and into med school she gets less
and less successful every year

15:39.714 --> 15:41.982
because avoiding conflict
in life doesn't work

15:42.016 --> 15:43.250
because there's
always going to be conflict.

15:43.284 --> 15:46.620
What do you know
about being a good girl.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.856
I make it my business
to know, you know?

15:48.890 --> 15:51.692
I'm a doctor for women.

15:51.726 --> 15:54.895
I like women.
I love your mother.

15:54.929 --> 15:57.664
Wow, I actually like
what you had to say.

15:57.699 --> 15:59.800
Thank you.
You're welcome.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.435
It's kind of freeing

16:01.469 --> 16:03.904
to think that I don't
have to be the good girl

16:03.938 --> 16:05.472
because to be honest,

16:05.507 --> 16:07.941
I don't think I was that good at
being a good girl to begin with,

16:07.976 --> 16:10.144
so maybe it's just
for the better.

16:10.178 --> 16:14.081
I'm not saying that you
should go out and have fun.

16:14.115 --> 16:17.084
I mean, fun as we know,
has consequences,

16:17.118 --> 16:19.820
you know, STDs, unplanned
pregnancies, heartbreak.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.622
so, you know,
not all of it's good.

16:21.656 --> 16:22.656
No, I know that,

16:22.690 --> 16:27.227
but now I know
that I can have fun,

16:27.262 --> 16:29.797
and I feel better about that,

16:29.831 --> 16:31.465
much better.

17:01.830 --> 17:04.131
We were both getting cold feet.

17:04.165 --> 17:06.666
Your mother's fine. I don't care
if she works a few more days.

17:06.701 --> 17:10.436
Because you both have cold feet and
it'll give you both more time to back out?

17:10.471 --> 17:14.107
Because my mom sent her a surprise
for the wedding, and it's not here yet.

17:14.142 --> 17:16.643
Wait, your mom knows
you two are getting married?

17:16.678 --> 17:19.413
That you're getting married
for the fourth time?

17:19.446 --> 17:21.481
I'm getting married to the
right woman for the first time,

17:21.516 --> 17:23.483
and that's the way
my mother feels about it, too.

17:23.518 --> 17:25.484
I thought you don't want
your family involved.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.253
You thought they wouldn't like
that you're marrying my mother.

17:27.288 --> 17:31.825
Yeah, and then I decided to not start off
this marriage by hiding it from my family,

17:31.860 --> 17:34.161
and I let them know. And they let
me know that they're very happy

17:34.195 --> 17:35.963
that your mother and I
are getting married.

17:35.997 --> 17:39.333
They're not going to fly here for a
short ceremony in the judge's chambers,

17:39.367 --> 17:41.201
but they're happy
we're getting married.

17:41.236 --> 17:46.006
Oh. So after all these years, your
mother actually harbors no resentment

17:46.040 --> 17:48.308
against my mother getting
pregnant with me. That's right.

17:48.343 --> 17:50.510
Sometimes, the most
difficult conversations

17:50.545 --> 17:52.045
turn out to be
the best conversations.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.648
Which I guess
you're hoping for, too.

17:54.682 --> 17:57.384
Leo called.
I know Ricky's back.

17:57.418 --> 18:00.320
Oh, is he?

18:00.355 --> 18:02.789
You're not dressed like that
for no reason.

18:02.824 --> 18:05.125
Dressed like what?

18:05.159 --> 18:10.464
Adrian, Ricky's really upset with
you and with Amy and with Ben.

18:10.498 --> 18:13.467
Leo says he's come back here
to talk to each of you.

18:13.501 --> 18:16.470
The guy's pretty upset.
And why wouldn't he be?

18:16.504 --> 18:19.139
Whatever. I'm not afraid
to talk to Ricky.

18:19.173 --> 18:21.141
I'm kind of
looking forward to it.

18:21.175 --> 18:24.811
Well, if you need to talk to me
afterwards, just call my office.

18:24.846 --> 18:26.480
They'll get word to me
and I'll call you back.

18:26.514 --> 18:27.814
Why would I need
to talk to you?

18:27.849 --> 18:29.349
You think Ricky's
going to commit a crime?

18:29.384 --> 18:31.818
I don't imagine whatever
conversation you have with Ricky

18:31.853 --> 18:33.186
will be all that pleasant.

18:33.221 --> 18:35.155
Yeah, it might not
start out that way,

18:35.189 --> 18:36.657
but you never know
what will happen.

18:36.691 --> 18:38.058
No, you don't.

18:38.092 --> 18:41.828
So maybe you want to talk to
someone after you talk to him?

18:41.863 --> 18:44.831
Someone like an adult
who cares about you.

18:44.866 --> 18:47.834
At least, I would suggest you start
talking to someone who cares about you,

18:47.869 --> 18:51.505
rather than running off to have sex
with someone who doesn't care about you.

18:51.539 --> 18:54.174
Ben cares about me.
We're friends, okay?

18:54.208 --> 18:55.909
What else do you know?

18:55.944 --> 18:58.845
I know that Ricky
is probably angry and hurt,

18:58.880 --> 19:00.113
and when people
are angry and hurt,

19:00.148 --> 19:01.848
sometimes they say
angry and hurtful things.

19:01.883 --> 19:03.784
Yeah, yeah, sticks and
stones and all that,

19:03.818 --> 19:05.552
but words can never harm me.

19:05.586 --> 19:07.788
Then you're stronger
than most people.

19:07.822 --> 19:10.123
Yes, I am.

19:10.158 --> 19:11.224
At least, than most girls.

19:11.259 --> 19:14.828
How's that?
Well, let's see...

19:14.862 --> 19:17.998
A little girl grows up
without a daddy,

19:18.032 --> 19:20.767
and it becomes apparent that
her mother was never married,

19:20.802 --> 19:24.171
and eventually, she doesn't
care what people think.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.739
She only cares
what she thinks.

19:27.108 --> 19:30.077
And I don't keep anything in.
I act everything out.

19:30.111 --> 19:35.182
Yeah, and not always
in the best way.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.850
You want some advice, Adrian,

19:36.884 --> 19:38.585
coming from a guy who's made
a lot of mistakes

19:38.619 --> 19:40.354
and done a lot
of stupid things in his life?

19:40.388 --> 19:44.524
No. Yeah, well, I'm going
to give it to you anyway.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.160
Listen to whatever Ricky
wants to say without comment.

19:47.195 --> 19:50.197
Not a chance. And say you're
sorry about what happened,

19:50.231 --> 19:51.865
and then let it go.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.368
Take a break. Give him some
time to think about things.

19:54.402 --> 19:57.537
You think about things.
Back up. Say I'm sorry?

19:57.572 --> 20:00.207
I'm not sorry.
He kissed Amy.

20:00.241 --> 20:03.110
He crossed a line, so I slept
with Ben. That's how I roll.

20:03.144 --> 20:06.546
Adrian, I know you're sorry
about what happened with Ben.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.882
Even if you say you're not,
I know you are.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.851
And I think you should
tell Ricky that.

20:10.885 --> 20:12.352
Even if you and Ricky
don't end up together,

20:12.387 --> 20:13.653
don't you want
to end up friends?

20:13.688 --> 20:16.890
So Ricky ends up friends
with me, but Amy's husband?

20:16.924 --> 20:19.559
Never. Never.
I didn't say that.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.228
I don't think that's ever
going to happen.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.696
Do you think that's
ever going to happen?

20:22.730 --> 20:23.964
Not if I can help it.

20:23.998 --> 20:26.566
I have to finish
getting ready.

20:26.601 --> 20:29.236
All right, Adrian. I don't
think you heard a word I said,

20:29.270 --> 20:32.239
but all right.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.907
Listen, if you need me,
just call me.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.444
I know. Call your office
and they'll find you.

20:37.478 --> 20:41.248
I heard every word you said. I
did. I just don't agree with you.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.116
Right.

21:03.151 --> 21:05.119
You know your little friend
Ricky's back, right?

21:05.153 --> 21:06.520
I heard.
Did you.

21:06.555 --> 21:09.657
Yes.
Who'd you hear it from?

21:09.691 --> 21:12.460
He called me. I didn't talk
to him. He left me a message.

21:12.494 --> 21:14.495
He said he'd see me at school.

21:14.529 --> 21:16.964
Oh, really? Am I supposed
to believe that?

21:16.998 --> 21:20.468
Because after you lied to me
about not knowing where he was,

21:20.502 --> 21:23.804
I don't know what to believe.
Yeah, I know. That was wrong of me.

21:23.839 --> 21:25.373
But I didn't know
where his mother was.

21:25.407 --> 21:26.974
I just knew he'd go see her.

21:27.008 --> 21:29.810
He'd been wanting to see her.

21:29.845 --> 21:33.114
And I thought it would make Amy
feel better, knowing he was okay...

21:33.148 --> 21:34.782
That he didn't just
run away from her,

21:34.816 --> 21:37.151
he was going to take care
of some unfinished business.

21:37.185 --> 21:38.285
The point is, you lied.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.121
And you and me,
we don't lie to each other.

21:40.155 --> 21:41.789
That's our thing, honesty.

21:41.823 --> 21:44.725
And in the swirl of insanity
around us, we were clinging to that,

21:44.760 --> 21:46.460
to our honesty
with each other.

21:46.495 --> 21:49.463
I know. I blew it.

21:49.498 --> 21:51.132
But it did make Amy feel better.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.333
She and I had a secret.

21:52.367 --> 21:54.301
And I couldn't trust you
with the information.

21:54.336 --> 21:55.803
I was afraid you'd tell
Mr. Boykevich,

21:55.837 --> 21:57.371
and he'd figure out
where Ricky was.

21:57.406 --> 21:58.372
He figured it out anyway.

21:58.407 --> 21:59.907
Yeah, but not before
Ricky had a chance

21:59.941 --> 22:01.041
to talk to his mother.

22:01.076 --> 22:02.810
All right. From now on,
no more lies.

22:02.844 --> 22:04.445
I promise.

22:04.479 --> 22:07.515
What do you think?

22:07.549 --> 22:09.216
I think you look ridiculous.

22:09.251 --> 22:11.752
That's my girl.
Now here's the hard question...

22:11.787 --> 22:14.288
What's going on with Ricky? What
does he want to talk to Amy about?

22:14.322 --> 22:18.058
I don't know what's going on between the
two of them. That's between Ricky and Amy.

22:18.093 --> 22:22.430
But I don't envy him trying to have
any kind of discussion with her.

22:22.464 --> 22:23.664
She's not easy to talk to.

22:23.698 --> 22:25.666
And you are?
Yeah, I am.

22:25.700 --> 22:28.736
What's Ricky's real interest in you?
Seriously. Don't you think it's sex?

22:28.770 --> 22:31.305
No, I don't.
We're friends.

22:31.339 --> 22:33.607
How come he's friends with you
and not the mother of his baby?

22:33.642 --> 22:35.342
Again, she's not
that easy to talk to.

22:35.377 --> 22:36.744
Come on, she's not that bad.

22:36.778 --> 22:41.315
No, she's not bad at all.
She's good. Too good.

22:42.451 --> 22:45.453
You can't really fight with her.

22:45.487 --> 22:47.621
You say something mean to her
because she drives you crazy,

22:47.656 --> 22:49.457
but then instead of saying
something mean back,

22:49.491 --> 22:51.892
she just says, "Oh, you're so
mean to me," and walks away.

22:51.927 --> 22:53.761
She doesn't get that when
someone throws you a punch,

22:53.795 --> 22:57.465
you throw them one back, and you go
back and forth until the fight's over,

22:57.499 --> 23:00.935
and then the fight's over.
It's never over with her.

23:00.969 --> 23:03.237
And if she ever does
stand up for herself,

23:03.271 --> 23:05.739
she turns around
and apologizes for it later,

23:05.774 --> 23:08.409
or she just feels bad about it.

23:08.443 --> 23:10.411
It's like shadow boxing.

23:10.445 --> 23:11.912
You keep punching
until you're tired,

23:11.947 --> 23:15.449
but then you don't really
accomplish anything.

23:15.484 --> 23:16.917
Come on, Ash.
I think your sister's

23:16.952 --> 23:18.586
gotten a lot stronger
since she had the baby.

23:18.620 --> 23:20.254
She doesn't cry as much
as she used to.

23:20.288 --> 23:21.755
She still cries.

23:21.790 --> 23:23.924
I see her speaking her mind
with a lot more ease

23:23.959 --> 23:25.426
than she ever did before.

23:25.460 --> 23:27.628
She's certainly been speaking
her mind with me and your mother.

23:27.662 --> 23:32.099
Yeah. I admit, she's not
as nice as she used to be.

23:32.133 --> 23:34.768
But having John
hasn't been all bad.

23:34.803 --> 23:36.770
When she starts
her life again in 18 years,

23:36.805 --> 23:40.107
she's probably going to be a lot
stronger person because of him.

23:40.141 --> 23:41.408
A much better person.

23:41.443 --> 23:42.776
I really think that.

23:42.811 --> 23:44.778
You ever say that stuff
to her? The nice stuff.

23:44.813 --> 23:49.950
No, I can't. I've got a lot of bad stuff
I have to say first before I get to it.

23:49.985 --> 23:54.121
Not that I ever mean to say
the bad stuff in a bad way.

23:54.155 --> 23:56.457
It just jumps out
at the wrong time,

23:56.491 --> 23:59.226
when I'm angry with her. Why do you
have to say any of the bad stuff?

23:59.261 --> 24:01.395
Why can't you say the
nice stuff? Don't ask me.

24:01.429 --> 24:05.065
Ask your therapist, and all the
other therapists in the world.

24:05.100 --> 24:08.636
I'm just 15. I have to say what I think
and what I feel, and I get that from you.

24:08.670 --> 24:12.840
Yeah, you do. So you think
the new hair was a mistake?

24:12.874 --> 24:14.108
Definitely.

24:14.142 --> 24:16.677
But it probably worked
for your purposes.

24:16.711 --> 24:19.179
Probably.

24:19.214 --> 24:22.082
How'd you find out?
Mr. Boykevich called Dad.

24:22.117 --> 24:23.651
Oh. And?

24:23.685 --> 24:28.088
And supposedly, Ricky's angry
and has come back to confront me.

24:28.123 --> 24:29.156
And Ben and Adrian.

24:29.190 --> 24:30.391
He's angry with you?

24:30.425 --> 24:33.327
That's what Dad said.

24:33.361 --> 24:34.828
He's angry with you about what?

24:34.863 --> 24:36.363
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

24:36.398 --> 24:39.099
Why not?
Why?

24:39.134 --> 24:40.834
You just want him
to be angry with you

24:40.869 --> 24:42.436
and never tell you why?

24:42.470 --> 24:43.871
That's the opposite
of confrontation.

24:43.905 --> 24:45.773
He doesn't get to be
angry with me.

24:45.807 --> 24:49.510
He doesn't get to confront me unless I
feel like being confronted, and I don't.

24:49.544 --> 24:51.712
Anyone can be angry
with anyone about anything.

24:51.746 --> 24:54.448
Then he can just keep it to
himself. Maybe it's not true.

24:54.482 --> 24:55.683
Maybe he's not
angry with you,

24:55.717 --> 24:57.685
but the only way to find out
is to talk to him.

24:57.719 --> 25:00.287
You're going to have to
talk to him eventually, Amy.

25:00.322 --> 25:02.056
Even if you manage
to avoid him at school,

25:02.090 --> 25:04.058
he's still going
to be over here to see John.

25:04.092 --> 25:06.060
You're still going to have
to see little John's daddy.

25:06.094 --> 25:09.063
There's no way to avoid that. I
know that he's little John's daddy.

25:09.097 --> 25:11.065
And that's why he has
no right to be angry.

25:11.099 --> 25:13.400
I hate that. I hate hearing
that he's angry with me.

25:13.435 --> 25:16.236
He has a right to feel any way
that he feels, and so do you.

25:16.271 --> 25:18.405
But if Ricky's angry with you
about something,

25:18.440 --> 25:19.707
just hear him out,
okay, Amy?

25:19.741 --> 25:24.078
Maybe he just needs to talk.
He just needs to be heard.

25:24.112 --> 25:26.413
Then he can go to a therapist.

25:26.448 --> 25:29.750
Oh, that's right. He's been
going to therapy for years.

25:29.784 --> 25:31.418
Do you want to go, too?

25:31.453 --> 25:33.988
Me? Why would I go to therapy?

25:34.022 --> 25:36.423
It might be a good place
to work things out,

25:36.458 --> 25:37.992
by yourself or with Ricky.

25:38.026 --> 25:40.427
Like he and Adrian did?

25:40.462 --> 25:41.762
That worked out well,
didn't it?

25:41.796 --> 25:43.697
Adrian ended up having sex
with Ricky's friend.

25:43.732 --> 25:46.500
Ricky's friend? Ben.

25:46.534 --> 25:48.435
You can say his name.
I don't want to.

25:48.470 --> 25:51.372
I just want to forget that he
ever existed. Well, he exists.

25:51.406 --> 25:53.440
And it was a lousy thing
that Ben did,

25:53.475 --> 25:55.442
but when enough time
has passed

25:55.477 --> 25:57.111
and you think
you can handle it,

25:57.145 --> 25:58.379
you two need to talk, too.

25:58.413 --> 25:59.847
To a therapist
or to each other?

26:00.982 --> 26:03.117
I told you, we already talked.

26:03.151 --> 26:07.054
That's not talking. Just because you
got over Dad sleeping with Adrian's mom,

26:07.088 --> 26:10.491
do not think that I will ever get over
Ben sleeping with Adrian, because I'm not.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.292
I think that Ricky's
not the only one

26:12.327 --> 26:13.727
that needs to confront
his demons.

26:13.762 --> 26:15.095
I think that you do, too.

26:15.130 --> 26:17.231
What demons?
Ben and Ricky and Adrian?

26:18.533 --> 26:19.733
I can't.

26:19.768 --> 26:20.734
You can if you want.

26:20.769 --> 26:22.102
Why would I put myself
through that?

26:22.137 --> 26:24.171
Haven't I done enough
for John already?

26:26.775 --> 26:29.743
Let me answer that. No.

26:29.778 --> 26:31.145
I can never do enough for him.

26:32.814 --> 26:35.149
I really, really love him, Mom.

26:35.183 --> 26:38.152
Then like Ricky,
do what you have to do.

27:33.046 --> 27:34.514
I had to tell her.

27:34.549 --> 27:35.849
I didn't tell her
where you were,

27:35.883 --> 27:37.517
but you're John's father.

27:37.552 --> 27:39.653
And despite what she said, I
knew she was worried about you.

27:39.687 --> 27:42.889
Ben really hurt her, and...

27:42.924 --> 27:44.858
It's okay, Ash. I didn't say
you couldn't say anything.

27:44.892 --> 27:46.826
I just figured you wouldn't.

27:46.861 --> 27:49.863
Ordinarily, I wouldn't have,
but I can't say I'm sorry,

27:49.897 --> 27:52.065
because I felt it was the
right thing to do at the time.

27:52.099 --> 27:53.633
Then it probably was.

27:53.668 --> 27:55.035
So you're going
to stick around?

27:55.069 --> 27:56.836
I don't know.

27:56.871 --> 27:59.072
I have some options.
I'm considering my options.

27:59.106 --> 28:02.409
Yeah, options. All of which include
doing what's best for your son, I hope.

28:02.443 --> 28:03.810
Of course.

28:03.844 --> 28:05.679
So you can't really
go anywhere.

28:05.713 --> 28:08.481
No, I can. I don't know when,

28:08.516 --> 28:10.250
but I'm definitely going
to get away for a while.

28:10.284 --> 28:12.319
Definitely.

28:12.353 --> 28:13.386
I didn't say you could go.

28:13.421 --> 28:15.555
Oh, hey, Ben.
It's good to see you.

28:15.590 --> 28:18.525
Hey, Ashley.
Oh, watch the shoulder.

28:18.559 --> 28:19.826
I've got a bad shoulder.

28:19.860 --> 28:21.995
So you're still
speaking to me?

28:22.029 --> 28:23.763
What's not speaking to you
going to do for me?

28:23.798 --> 28:25.865
What's not speaking to me
doing for your sister?

28:25.900 --> 28:28.368
Why don't you just
man up and speak to her?

28:30.204 --> 28:32.572
So I guess the two of you
are friends

28:32.607 --> 28:34.074
after everything
was said and done?

28:34.108 --> 28:37.777
Nice way of putting
my idiotic behavior, but yes.

28:37.812 --> 28:39.346
Good. I like both of you.

28:40.615 --> 28:41.881
And so does my nephew.

28:41.916 --> 28:43.650
Wish I could find
some way to see him.

28:43.684 --> 28:44.884
Maybe you can, some day.

28:44.919 --> 28:46.586
Just speak to her.

29:11.812 --> 29:13.246
Hi, Adrian.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.648
Ashley.

29:14.682 --> 29:16.249
Bye.

29:18.686 --> 29:20.086
Hi, Ben.

29:20.121 --> 29:21.721
Hi, Ricky.

29:24.191 --> 29:26.092
I'll let you two talk.

29:26.127 --> 29:30.597
Okay, Ben. Oh, and I'll
talk to you later, okay?

29:35.803 --> 29:37.070
Hey, Ben.

29:37.104 --> 29:38.471
Hey.

29:45.980 --> 29:47.247
Miss me?

29:47.281 --> 29:49.949
Yes, I missed you,

29:49.984 --> 29:52.952
and I'm going to continue
missing you.

29:52.987 --> 29:55.388
I can't do it anymore, Adrian.
I honestly can't.

29:55.423 --> 29:57.957
But we don't have to
talk about it now.

29:57.992 --> 30:00.460
We can talk after school if
you want to talk about it.

30:00.494 --> 30:03.830
We can talk about it now. We've
said all this before. I know.

30:03.864 --> 30:06.833
And then you changed your mind.
Won't you change your mind?

30:06.867 --> 30:08.101
You can't.

30:08.135 --> 30:09.903
Let me try.

30:09.937 --> 30:11.438
No, I'm not playing anymore.

30:11.472 --> 30:13.306
Fine. No more playing.

30:13.340 --> 30:15.075
But you shouldn't
have kissed Amy.

30:15.109 --> 30:17.644
No, I shouldn't have, and you
shouldn't have slept with Ben.

30:17.678 --> 30:19.145
But we were over before then.

30:19.180 --> 30:21.681
Anything we had going was over
the first time I cheated on you.

30:21.716 --> 30:23.216
I don't know a lot about love,

30:23.250 --> 30:25.652
but I'm pretty sure
if a man loves a woman,

30:25.686 --> 30:27.821
really loves her,
he doesn't cheat on her.

30:27.855 --> 30:29.756
But I cheated on you, too.

30:29.790 --> 30:31.825
Yeah, you did,
and I'm pretty sure

30:31.859 --> 30:33.993
when a woman loves a man,
she doesn't cheat on him.

30:34.028 --> 30:37.397
You know what? Let's forget
all that and start over.

30:37.431 --> 30:39.933
I don't want to forget all
that. I don't want to start over.

30:39.967 --> 30:41.534
I'm ending this.

30:42.803 --> 30:44.604
You don't love me, Adrian,

30:44.638 --> 30:45.638
and I don't love you.

30:45.673 --> 30:47.474
Yes, you do.

30:47.508 --> 30:49.242
No, I don't.

30:49.276 --> 30:52.946
Come on, Ricky. I know you
love me, and I love you.

30:52.980 --> 30:54.214
Don't run away from me.

30:54.248 --> 30:56.282
I'm not running away
from anything.

30:56.317 --> 30:58.952
I might be leaving at some
point, but I'm not running away.

30:58.986 --> 31:01.988
I'm just facing the truth,
and the truth is, Adrian,

31:02.022 --> 31:03.957
you and I cannot
trust each other.

31:03.991 --> 31:05.625
You don't make
a good girlfriend.

31:05.659 --> 31:06.960
I don't make
a good boyfriend.

31:06.994 --> 31:09.229
And some day, I want to be a
good husband and good father.

31:09.263 --> 31:13.299
And this, you and me,
this relationship,

31:13.334 --> 31:16.970
that's not the way to become
a good husband or father.

31:17.004 --> 31:18.304
I'll see you around.

31:18.339 --> 31:20.073
Is this about Amy?

31:20.107 --> 31:22.976
No, this is about me.

31:43.464 --> 31:44.430
Amy?

31:44.465 --> 31:46.599
Hey, Ricky.

31:46.634 --> 31:48.968
I'm happy you're back.

31:49.003 --> 31:50.236
I heard
you're upset with me,

31:50.271 --> 31:51.871
but I don't want to talk
at school.

31:51.906 --> 31:54.607
All right.
Could I come over tonight?

31:54.642 --> 31:56.242
I really miss John.

31:56.277 --> 31:59.279
Yeah. He's missed you, too.

31:59.313 --> 32:00.313
We'll talk tonight.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.086
I love you, John.

32:07.121 --> 32:11.124
I really, really love you.

32:14.654 --> 32:16.288
That's what I heard...
They broke up.

32:16.323 --> 32:17.623
They break up all the time.

32:17.657 --> 32:18.958
No, for real this time.

32:18.992 --> 32:20.626
Okay.
I mean it.

32:20.660 --> 32:23.295
I don't care, Madison.
I just don't care.

32:23.330 --> 32:24.630
I bet he goes for Amy.

32:24.664 --> 32:26.298
I don't think so.
I think so.

32:26.333 --> 32:27.800
He just ran away from Amy.

32:27.834 --> 32:29.301
No, from Adrian,

32:29.336 --> 32:30.970
because of what she did
with Ben.

32:31.004 --> 32:34.240
Yeah, all right, he ran away
from Ben and Adrian and Amy.

32:34.274 --> 32:35.741
I don't think he's going
back with Amy.

32:35.775 --> 32:36.909
But she had his baby.

32:36.943 --> 32:38.677
Exactly.

32:38.712 --> 32:40.913
Crying?
Yup, that's what I heard.

32:40.947 --> 32:42.581
She ran out of school crying.

32:42.616 --> 32:44.250
Huh.
I'm not surprised.

32:44.284 --> 32:45.584
I'm not interested.

32:45.619 --> 32:48.254
You know what this means?
That they're broken up.

32:48.288 --> 32:50.556
They're broken up because he's
in love with Amy. Always has been.

32:50.590 --> 32:53.559
Wellokay.
That's all you can say?

32:53.593 --> 32:55.227
Uh, yeah.

32:55.262 --> 32:57.229
This is something
that I'm interested in.

32:57.264 --> 33:00.232
I pretend to be interested when
you talk about your stupid cockatoo,

33:00.267 --> 33:02.568
so you pretend
to be interested in this.

33:02.602 --> 33:05.237
This is way more exciting
than your bird saying "Obama."

33:05.272 --> 33:06.572
This is real life.

33:06.606 --> 33:08.908
My bird saying "Obama"
is real life.

33:08.942 --> 33:10.242
What do you have
against my bird?

33:11.611 --> 33:13.579
Madison.

33:13.613 --> 33:16.248
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

33:16.283 --> 33:18.918
He's coming over
tonight. Ricky.

33:18.952 --> 33:20.619
This is it.

33:22.289 --> 33:24.256
Now we know why Ricky told Ben

33:24.291 --> 33:25.591
that Amy
will never forgive him.

33:25.625 --> 33:26.759
He wants her.

33:26.793 --> 33:27.927
How do we know that?

33:27.961 --> 33:28.928
He broke up with Adrian.

33:28.962 --> 33:30.262
How do we know that?

33:30.297 --> 33:31.597
He broke up with Adrian.

33:31.631 --> 33:33.198
Yeah?

33:33.233 --> 33:35.534
Are you stupid? This ruins
any chance that Ben had.

33:35.568 --> 33:36.869
Not with Grace Bowman.

33:36.903 --> 33:38.203
He doesn't love
Grace Bowman.

33:38.238 --> 33:40.973
He would if Amy
was out of the picture.

33:43.109 --> 33:45.411
I just want to clear the air.

33:45.445 --> 33:47.279
Yeah. Thanks, Grace. I
wanted to talk to you, too.

33:47.314 --> 33:50.716
But of course, your first
concern was to talk to Amy.

33:50.750 --> 33:51.951
And Adrian.

33:51.985 --> 33:55.220
Yeah. Not that Amy's
talking to me, but...

33:55.255 --> 33:57.556
She will, in time.
I'm sure of it.

33:57.590 --> 33:59.925
Hey, I talked to Jack after
Adrian had sex with him.

34:01.394 --> 34:04.229
I guess you and Adrian did
more than Adrian and Jack did,

34:04.264 --> 34:05.898
but still,
eventually I forgave him

34:05.932 --> 34:09.534
and we ended up getting
back together. Unfortunately.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.503
Unfortunately?

34:11.538 --> 34:14.239
Ben, you and I
have something in common.

34:14.274 --> 34:15.908
We both had sex
for the first time

34:15.942 --> 34:17.743
with the wrong person
at the wrong time.

34:17.777 --> 34:20.145
It's just not a good feeling.

34:20.179 --> 34:22.915
I like sex.
You could even say I love sex.

34:22.949 --> 34:25.583
I just didn't love how it
made me feel the next day.

34:25.618 --> 34:28.253
Or the next week,
or the next month.

34:28.288 --> 34:29.420
I'm sorry I ever did it.

34:29.456 --> 34:31.623
Yeah, I know that feeling.

34:31.658 --> 34:35.293
But next time, I want it to be with
the right person at the right time.

34:35.328 --> 34:38.630
It's just so complicated.
How do you know?

34:38.665 --> 34:40.866
Yeah. How can you know?

34:40.900 --> 34:42.668
It was easy when I could
just use my religion

34:42.702 --> 34:44.536
and say "Never,
not until marriage."

34:44.571 --> 34:46.138
But I don't believe that.

34:46.172 --> 34:48.306
And I wish I did,
but I don't.

34:48.341 --> 34:50.208
I don't think I can wait
until I'm married.

34:50.243 --> 34:52.543
I don't know if I want to wait.

34:52.579 --> 34:56.014
But still, next time, I hope it'll
be with the guy I end up marrying.

34:56.049 --> 34:57.883
Yeah, and next time,
I want it to be

34:57.917 --> 34:59.351
with a girl
I end up marrying.

34:59.386 --> 35:01.220
Although I don't know
if I'm going to find

35:01.254 --> 35:02.888
that person in high school.

35:02.922 --> 35:04.857
I guess that could
happen, though.

35:04.891 --> 35:07.259
Yeah. I mean, my mom and dad
met in high school.

35:07.293 --> 35:10.763
So can we still hang out
as friends? You and me.

35:10.797 --> 35:12.831
Of course, Grace.

35:12.866 --> 35:15.968
And could I get a ride
home from school?

35:16.002 --> 35:17.669
Oh, yeah. You bet.

35:28.948 --> 35:30.182
The office told me you called.

35:41.561 --> 35:42.895
Is this about Ricky?

35:47.367 --> 35:50.836
Adrian, I'm sorry.

35:50.870 --> 35:52.004
I'm really sorry.

35:56.876 --> 35:57.943
Want some ice cream?

36:07.053 --> 36:09.822
It'll be okay, Adrian.

36:09.856 --> 36:12.458
Everything will be fine.

36:18.498 --> 36:20.532
I told her. I told her
she's pretty and smart

36:20.567 --> 36:22.367
and she's a wonderful
mother and sister.

36:22.402 --> 36:25.537
Why'd you do that? I'm happy that
you did that, but why did you do that?

36:25.572 --> 36:28.173
I told her if she did that,
Grant could come over.

36:28.208 --> 36:31.543
And I did that. Couldn't you
just do that for no reason?

36:31.578 --> 36:33.445
Just say something nice to your
sister because you love her.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.480
No.

36:34.514 --> 36:35.714
Why not?

36:35.748 --> 36:36.815
Because it's called
self-esteem.

36:36.850 --> 36:39.818
Self. She has to say
nice things to herself.

36:39.853 --> 36:41.820
She has to believe
in herself.

36:41.855 --> 36:43.655
She has to speak up
for herself.

36:43.690 --> 36:47.159
I don't think Amy needed you to say
something to her you didn't mean.

36:47.193 --> 36:48.994
And I think
that Amy's doing fine.

36:49.028 --> 36:51.163
I think she did okay
for herself at school today.

36:51.197 --> 36:53.665
Okay how? She spoke to Ben...
"Hello, Ben." "Hello, Amy."

36:53.700 --> 36:55.501
And she told Ricky
she'd talk to him tonight.

36:55.535 --> 36:58.170
And she's in there right now,
talking to him.

36:58.204 --> 37:00.672
And I'm sure that, boosted by your
comments to her, she'll be strong.

37:00.707 --> 37:01.907
Invincible. She is woman.

37:01.941 --> 37:03.842
And that's why Grant
gets to come over...

37:03.877 --> 37:05.711
Because Sugar Plum
boosted Amy's ego.

37:09.249 --> 37:10.983
You don't have to say
anything to anyone.

37:11.017 --> 37:13.152
We're just going to hang out in
my room. Good night, everyone.

37:13.186 --> 37:14.186
Hi, Mrs. Juergens.

37:14.220 --> 37:15.487
Mr. Juergens.

37:15.522 --> 37:17.422
Thanks for letting me
come over on a school night.

37:17.457 --> 37:19.491
Thanks for letting me
come over any night.

37:19.526 --> 37:20.659
Oh, for crying out loud.

37:20.693 --> 37:23.195
You're welcome.
Just don't stay past 10.

37:23.229 --> 37:26.532
10? I told her she could teach
parenting classes to other teen mothers.

37:26.566 --> 37:27.833
10:30.

37:27.867 --> 37:31.436
Let's go.

37:31.471 --> 37:34.439
I don't think I'm ready for
Ashley to have a boyfriend.

37:34.474 --> 37:38.110
Yeah. Me, neither. What about
you? Ready to have a husband?

37:38.144 --> 37:39.678
George...

37:39.712 --> 37:42.114
I love that you love me,

37:42.148 --> 37:43.282
and that you would do
something crazy

37:43.316 --> 37:44.449
like what you did
to your hair,

37:44.484 --> 37:46.451
but let's see
if the feeling lasts.

37:46.486 --> 37:48.787
Let's see if we're
still in love a year from now

37:48.821 --> 37:50.289
when our anniversary
rolls around,

37:50.323 --> 37:52.724
and if we are, let's get
remarried on our anniversary.

37:52.759 --> 37:54.126
What?

37:54.160 --> 37:56.795
We can live together as two
independent, single people

37:56.829 --> 37:57.896
who just want to be together,

37:57.931 --> 37:59.364
can't we?
No, we can't.

37:59.399 --> 38:00.766
Sure we can.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.368
No, I'm not doing that.
I want to get married now.

38:03.403 --> 38:05.470
I know, but I don't really
want to get married now,

38:05.505 --> 38:07.105
so this would be
a nice compromise.

38:07.140 --> 38:08.874
It's not a compromise, it's
you getting what you want.

38:08.908 --> 38:10.876
Is there something
wrong with that?

38:10.910 --> 38:12.144
Anne, I'll give you
everything you want,

38:12.178 --> 38:13.946
but I don't want to wait
till next year

38:13.980 --> 38:15.714
to think about getting married.
Our anniversary just passed.

38:15.748 --> 38:17.482
It's only a year.

38:17.517 --> 38:18.884
Your hair will be in
by then.

38:20.153 --> 38:21.620
Sorry, I was trying
to lighten the mood.

38:21.654 --> 38:23.155
The mood's not light.

38:23.189 --> 38:25.791
We have a son. I want us
to be his married parents.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.160
I hear that,
but I want to wait.

38:28.194 --> 38:29.261
For what, Anne? For what?

38:29.295 --> 38:30.929
I'm not saying no.

38:30.964 --> 38:33.232
Yeah? Well, I am. Moose.

38:42.809 --> 38:45.777
All right, now that we got
the little guy in bed,

38:45.812 --> 38:47.112
we should talk.

38:47.146 --> 38:48.780
Do we have to?

38:48.815 --> 38:50.682
I'm actually enjoying
having you here.

38:50.717 --> 38:52.618
We have to, Amy.

38:52.652 --> 38:54.253
We have a lot to talk about.

38:54.287 --> 38:56.755
All right. What did I do?

38:56.789 --> 38:58.557
What did you do?
Yeah, what did I do?

38:58.591 --> 39:01.159
Other than have that
beautiful boy in there.

39:01.194 --> 39:03.462
I'm happy you had the baby.

39:03.496 --> 39:07.466
I'm happy I have John in
my life. I love him, Amy.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.501
I know it's been
tough on you,

39:09.535 --> 39:11.470
but it's been tough
on me, too,

39:11.504 --> 39:13.438
and I wasn't handling
everything as well as I could.

39:13.473 --> 39:15.474
I want to apologize
for leaving,

39:15.508 --> 39:19.478
and for not telling you myself
that I wanted to see my mother.

39:19.512 --> 39:23.115
And I feel really badly about
tricking you into kissing me.

39:23.149 --> 39:27.486
But of course,
when I did kiss you,

39:27.520 --> 39:29.087
it became apparent
I wasn't tricking you

39:29.122 --> 39:30.856
into doing something
you didn't want to do.

39:32.091 --> 39:34.893
I just wanted
to kiss you anyway.

39:34.927 --> 39:38.497
But then, unlike
two adults with a baby

39:38.531 --> 39:40.999
who have some privacy
and can do stupid things

39:41.034 --> 39:42.501
without the whole
world knowing,

39:42.535 --> 39:44.036
your sister told your dad,

39:44.070 --> 39:46.538
and your dad said something
to me in front of Ruben,

39:46.572 --> 39:48.507
and then Ruben
said something to Adrian,

39:48.541 --> 39:51.176
and the little world around us
came tumbling down on me.

39:51.210 --> 39:53.512
I shouldn't have kissed you.
I'm sorry.

39:53.546 --> 39:54.980
It's more than that, Amy.

39:55.014 --> 39:57.516
We've both been acting
like kids with a kid.

39:57.550 --> 40:00.852
I don't want to act like a kid.
I want to act like an adult.

40:00.887 --> 40:03.855
I am an adult.
I'm a legal adult.

40:03.890 --> 40:07.626
I have an apartment.
I have a job. I have a son.

40:07.660 --> 40:09.895
So? I have a job, too.
Yeah, you do.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.531
But you live at home,
with your family and our son.

40:12.565 --> 40:15.867
And I can't see our son unless I
come over here and jump through hoops.

40:15.902 --> 40:18.170
You take John
to your place sometimes.

40:18.204 --> 40:20.405
Yes, and I pick him up
from here,

40:20.440 --> 40:21.873
and I bring him back here,

40:21.908 --> 40:23.875
and our business becomes
everyone else's business,

40:23.910 --> 40:25.210
and I'm tired of it.

40:25.244 --> 40:26.912
I don't think it's the
best thing for John.

40:26.946 --> 40:28.547
Okay, so what are you saying?

40:28.581 --> 40:30.882
That I should get my own place?

40:33.853 --> 40:36.188
That we should get
our own place? No, no.

40:38.191 --> 40:40.692
Because I would never
just live with you, not at 16.

40:40.727 --> 40:43.195
I want to take John
on weekends.

40:43.229 --> 40:45.997
I'll pick him up,
and then you pick him up

40:46.032 --> 40:47.599
on Sunday nights
from my apartment.

40:47.633 --> 40:48.867
What?

40:48.901 --> 40:50.168
I have work on Saturday,

40:50.203 --> 40:52.504
but my mom and dad
will watch John for me

40:52.538 --> 40:54.172
during work hours.
They want to do that.

40:54.207 --> 40:55.841
They want to see
more of John, too.

40:55.875 --> 40:57.542
In their house,
at my apartment.

40:57.577 --> 40:59.778
Not over here.
No.

40:59.812 --> 41:01.380
Think about it, Amy.

41:01.414 --> 41:02.814
This way,
you have weekends free.

41:02.849 --> 41:04.916
You can with your new boyfriend.
What's his name? Jimmy?

41:04.951 --> 41:07.085
And what, you and
whatever date you have

41:07.120 --> 41:09.755
can just play house
with my son? No.

41:09.789 --> 41:12.557
First, you run away because you
don't want any responsibilities...

41:12.592 --> 41:15.293
That's not why. It just became
overwhelming, and I ran off.

41:15.328 --> 41:16.728
I'm sorry.

41:16.763 --> 41:19.564
I thought maybe you and John
would be better off without me.

41:19.599 --> 41:22.667
Oh, and now you think
the complete opposite?

41:22.702 --> 41:24.269
What if you get
overwhelmed again?

41:24.303 --> 41:26.071
I'm not going to.
You might.

41:26.105 --> 41:28.507
You might suddenly get the urge
to go see your mother again

41:28.541 --> 41:30.876
or an aunt or an uncle
or something.

41:30.910 --> 41:32.411
Amy. What? You're not taking my son.

41:32.445 --> 41:35.781
Our son. He's not just
your son, he's our son.

41:35.815 --> 41:37.449
And I don't want
to just keep coming over here

41:37.483 --> 41:39.117
and be a part of your family
and their life.

41:39.152 --> 41:41.887
I want John to be part
of my family and my life.

41:41.921 --> 41:44.122
And by the way, if I have
a date, I have a date.

41:44.157 --> 41:46.458
I've never said anything
about Ben being around John,

41:46.492 --> 41:47.559
or Jimmy or anyone else.

41:47.593 --> 41:49.394
That's because
you're not his mother.

41:49.429 --> 41:50.462
What does that mean?

41:50.496 --> 41:52.130
I don't know. I'm his mother.

41:52.165 --> 41:53.398
I get to decide everything.

41:53.433 --> 41:56.435
No, Amy. You don't.
And you're not going to.

41:56.469 --> 41:58.236
You want to take him
on weekends

41:58.271 --> 41:59.638
and I'll take him
during the week?

41:59.672 --> 42:01.673
I'd be willing
to do that, too.

42:01.707 --> 42:04.142
I'm not going to let you take
him for five days of the week.

42:04.177 --> 42:07.145
That's crazy. This is his home.
He's used to this home.

42:07.180 --> 42:08.814
We're used to him.
I love him.

42:08.848 --> 42:10.582
I'm not going to let you
keep him all week.

42:10.616 --> 42:12.417
I'm not even going to let
you keep him all weekend.

42:12.452 --> 42:14.820
He's fine when he stays
over at my place.

42:14.854 --> 42:17.155
We have a good time together.

42:17.190 --> 42:18.156
I love him, Amy.

42:18.191 --> 42:20.158
Yeah? Well, I love him more.

42:20.193 --> 42:22.160
I'm sure you think so,

42:22.195 --> 42:25.831
since I haven't exactly been
doing all that I could be doing.

42:25.865 --> 42:26.965
But that's going to change.

42:28.968 --> 42:30.235
Don't do that, Amy.

42:33.473 --> 42:36.475
Don't cry.
I don't want to hurt you.

42:39.145 --> 42:40.779
But more importantly,

42:40.813 --> 42:43.615
I don't want to hurt my relationship
with my son over a lifetime

42:43.649 --> 42:45.484
by not doing
what I should be doing.

42:49.489 --> 42:51.456
Good night.
