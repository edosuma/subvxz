<i>All
right, 1-10, this is Dispatch.</i>

00:32.954 --> 00:34.657

00:35.391 --> 00:36.890

00:40.996 --> 00:42.429
<i>We're right around
the corner, Marianne.</i>

00:42.431 --> 00:43.698

01:21.636 --> 01:24.038

a white sedan. I repeat.</i>

01:24.040 --> 01:26.607
<i>Suspect is armed
and driving a white sedan.</i>

01:26.609 --> 01:28.576
<i>1-10 en route.</i>

01:34.516 --> 01:36.083

01:38.555 --> 01:40.621
<i>heading toward
the I-35 on-ramp.</i>

01:40.623 --> 01:42.756
<i>We are in pursuit,
requesting backup.</i>

01:42.758 --> 01:44.357
<i>You got a visual?</i>

01:44.359 --> 01:45.559
<i>Adam, four seconds.</i>

01:45.561 --> 01:46.863
<i>We'll catch up with him.</i>

02:10.219 --> 02:13.653
<i>Dispatch, we found
our white sedan, over.</i>

02:13.655 --> 02:15.157
<i>Are you requesting backup?</i>

02:15.958 --> 02:17.690
<i>Uh, no sign of the suspect.</i>

02:17.692 --> 02:19.895
<i>Just in case,
it's a blue car.</i>

02:20.996 --> 02:24.966
<i>All units,
on north I-35 in pursuit.</i>

02:24.968 --> 02:27.135
<i>Suspect now believed

02:27.137 --> 02:28.635
<i>a blue four-door sedan.</i>

02:30.806 --> 02:32.473
<i>State Highway Patrol's
engaged.</i>

02:32.475 --> 02:33.808
<i>10-4. All right.</i>

02:44.320 --> 02:48.022
Hey, excuse me.
Need some help?

02:48.024 --> 02:50.860
No, I'm good. Well...

02:51.627 --> 02:54.327
Damn thing started choking up
about a mile back.

02:54.329 --> 02:55.996
I tried to make it
to the next exit

02:55.998 --> 02:57.297
but it conked out.

02:57.299 --> 02:58.601
Let me take a look.

03:01.036 --> 03:02.903
Think it's the radiator?

03:06.508 --> 03:07.844
It could be.

03:09.578 --> 03:11.046
Is it shot?

03:12.248 --> 03:13.816
I wouldn't be surprised.

03:16.786 --> 03:19.320
You know anything
about cars?

03:19.322 --> 03:21.091
Uh, no, not really.

03:29.298 --> 03:30.800
So, where you headed?

03:31.534 --> 03:33.068
Oh, nowhere, really.

03:34.470 --> 03:37.740
- Just driving, huh?
- Hmm. Just driving.

03:39.275 --> 03:41.708
Hey, I like
that truck of yours.

03:41.710 --> 03:43.579
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Yeah?

03:46.415 --> 03:47.816
I stole it.

03:48.984 --> 03:49.984
Did you?

03:54.423 --> 03:55.791
No.

03:56.692 --> 03:58.391
It was my husband's.

03:58.393 --> 03:59.595
Oh.

04:00.697 --> 04:02.232
Where's he at?

04:03.600 --> 04:05.734
Well, he's...

04:07.068 --> 04:10.239
He's dead. That's...
That's where he's at.

04:11.340 --> 04:12.341
Oh.

04:15.644 --> 04:17.142
Can I ask you your name?

04:17.144 --> 04:18.178
Jewel.

04:18.180 --> 04:19.411
- Jewel?
- Mm-hmm.

04:19.414 --> 04:21.180
- That's your name?
- Yup.

04:21.183 --> 04:22.616
Why? You don't believe me?

04:22.618 --> 04:24.484
No, I believe you.
It's just, uh...

04:24.486 --> 04:25.854
well, it does suit you.

04:26.589 --> 04:27.723
Can say that.

04:28.490 --> 04:30.024
So, what about you?
What's your name,

04:30.026 --> 04:33.294
Mr. All-Dressed-Up
- In-A-Blue Suit?

04:34.363 --> 04:36.099
I'm Bob.
I'm Bob Callahan.

04:36.832 --> 04:38.366
<i>So, where are you headed?</i>

04:38.368 --> 04:39.666
<i>Home.</i>

04:39.668 --> 04:41.135
I've been on the road
for a while.

04:41.137 --> 04:42.036
Doing what?

04:42.038 --> 04:44.404
Oh, this and that.
I'm in sales.

04:44.406 --> 04:45.671
Oh. Selling what?

04:45.673 --> 04:46.907
<i>As I said,
a little of this...</i>

04:46.909 --> 04:48.377
<i>...little of that.</i>

04:49.878 --> 04:51.111
What are you looking for?

04:58.021 --> 05:00.186
- So, you like horses?
- What?

05:00.188 --> 05:03.590
- That thing you're...
- Oh! Yes! Yeah, I do.

05:03.592 --> 05:06.327
So, you're a cowgirl
who likes stealing cars?

05:06.329 --> 05:08.861
- What else am I missing?
- That's pretty much it.

05:08.863 --> 05:10.863
I have three horses.
I live in the country.

05:10.865 --> 05:12.500
- Three horses?
- I love to ride.

05:12.502 --> 05:13.633
- Yeah.
- What are their names?

05:13.635 --> 05:15.501
- The horses?
- Yeah.

05:15.503 --> 05:17.537
Wiley, Clementine,
and Dorothy Jean.

05:17.539 --> 05:19.138
Dorothy Jean?

05:19.140 --> 05:21.442
Sounds like my kinda gal.
Dorothy Jean.

05:21.444 --> 05:22.743
Do you ride?

05:22.745 --> 05:24.911
Me? No.
No, never. Never have.

05:24.913 --> 05:27.582
- But it's on my list.
- What list is that?

05:27.584 --> 05:29.450
Things I want to do
but haven't done yet.

05:29.452 --> 05:30.954
Well, you better hurry up.

05:32.055 --> 05:33.223
Yeah, how come?

05:35.558 --> 05:37.123
Anything else?

05:37.125 --> 05:38.892
- No. No, I think we're good.
- No, thank you.

05:38.894 --> 05:40.193
All right then.
Whenever you're ready.

05:40.195 --> 05:41.495
Thank you. Sure.

05:41.497 --> 05:43.964
No, no! You gave me a lift.
This is the least I can do.

05:43.966 --> 05:47.036
- No, no, don't worry about it.
- Please, I insist.

05:56.212 --> 05:57.380
Thank you.

06:03.952 --> 06:08.087
So, uh, what did you say
you do? Sales?

06:08.089 --> 06:10.558
- Yeah.
- Like door-to-door?

06:10.560 --> 06:12.493
- Uh, no, no, no.
- Bible salesman?

06:12.495 --> 06:14.794
No, definitely not. No.

06:14.796 --> 06:15.830
I'm kidding.

06:15.832 --> 06:18.401
Uh... can I tell you something?

06:20.069 --> 06:22.736
I don't know
the first thing about sales.

06:22.738 --> 06:24.772
- Oh.
- I just made it up.

06:24.774 --> 06:26.907
Well, what do you do then?

06:26.909 --> 06:28.476
Well, that's a secret.

06:29.646 --> 06:31.344
- Oh, is it now?
- Yeah.

06:31.346 --> 06:32.580
And why is that?

06:32.582 --> 06:33.781
Well, because if I told you,

06:33.783 --> 06:35.048
you probably wouldn't want
to see me again.

06:35.050 --> 06:36.750
Who said
I was gonna see you again?

06:36.752 --> 06:38.288
Would you?

07:25.500 --> 07:27.000
This is...

07:27.002 --> 07:29.034
- You're not serious, are you?
- I am.

07:29.036 --> 07:31.203
- This is a joke.
- I'm serious.

07:31.205 --> 07:32.940
- Oh, come on.
- No, joke. No, it's no joke.

07:32.942 --> 07:34.877
Why would you
even tell me, then?

07:35.777 --> 07:37.546
Well, I think
because I trust you.

07:38.815 --> 07:40.115
You just met me.

07:40.849 --> 07:43.118
Well, sometimes
you just know is all.

07:43.918 --> 07:45.488
With me, you know?

07:46.688 --> 07:48.255
Well, you're still
sitting here.

07:48.257 --> 07:50.056
Well, that's because
I don't believe you.

07:50.058 --> 07:52.428
And if I did believe you...

07:53.728 --> 07:55.061
So, what'd be worse?

07:55.063 --> 07:57.399
If I'm lying about this
or telling you the truth?

08:02.771 --> 08:03.703
Prove it.

08:03.705 --> 08:05.238
- Prove it?
- Yeah.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.409
- You want me to prove it?
- Yeah.

08:08.444 --> 08:09.979
What'll you do if I can?

08:10.979 --> 08:12.548
I won't walk out that door.

08:19.822 --> 08:20.955
No, I'm not gonna do it.

08:20.957 --> 08:23.289
I didn't think so.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.459
Not because I can't.

08:25.661 --> 08:27.495
Because it's just
not my style.

08:27.497 --> 08:29.363
- Not your style?
- Mnh-mnh.

08:29.365 --> 08:30.763
- You have style?
- I do.

08:30.765 --> 08:33.668
Well, uh, tell me
what that is then.

08:33.669 --> 08:35.369
- My style?
- Yeah.

08:36.703 --> 08:39.041
Okay, well,
let's take this place.

08:40.075 --> 08:42.976
This place is not my style.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.447
Say it was a bank.

08:45.214 --> 08:46.813
And instead of that counter
up there,

08:46.815 --> 08:48.448
that was really
a teller's window.

08:48.450 --> 08:49.616
And that lady standing there

08:49.618 --> 08:51.519
was the teller
behind the window.

08:51.521 --> 08:53.886
And you just walk in,
real calm,

08:53.888 --> 08:55.255
and you'd find yourself a spot

08:55.257 --> 08:56.255
- and you'd sit down...
- Hold your horses!

08:56.257 --> 08:58.458
...just like we're sitting here.

08:58.460 --> 09:00.360
And you wait and you watch.

09:00.362 --> 09:01.962
And that may take
a couple of hours,

09:01.964 --> 09:03.731
might take
a couple of days, even.

09:03.733 --> 09:05.798
But you wait.
It's gotta feel right.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.168
The timing has to feel right.

09:07.170 --> 09:09.572
And when it does feel right,
you make your move.

09:11.006 --> 09:13.941
So you walk right up,
look her in the eye,

09:13.943 --> 09:17.178
and you say,
"Ma'am, this is a robbery."

09:17.180 --> 09:19.048
And you show her the gun,
like this.

09:19.781 --> 09:20.981
You say, "I want you
to fill that bag

09:20.983 --> 09:22.348
"with money,
hand it over to me.

09:22.350 --> 09:24.320
"And don't do anything stupid
or foolish.

09:25.054 --> 09:27.053
"I wouldn't want you
to get hurt.

09:27.055 --> 09:28.291
"'Cause I like you.

09:29.892 --> 09:30.993
"I like you a lot.

09:31.728 --> 09:35.095
"As a matter of fact, I might
even be falling for you,

09:35.097 --> 09:37.264
so don't go breaking
my heart now, okay."

09:38.367 --> 09:40.000
So, she'd fill up
the bag with money.

09:40.002 --> 09:41.202
She'd hand it over to me.

09:41.204 --> 09:42.903
And I'd go out
just the way I came in,

09:42.905 --> 09:44.638
real casual-like.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.942
And she'd...

09:47.575 --> 09:49.411
You tell me what she'd do?

09:57.752 --> 10:00.520
Hey. I'm just
pulling your leg.

10:34.523 --> 10:37.122
His hands were shaking.
That's what I kept noticing.

10:37.124 --> 10:39.592
His hands were shaking
all over the place.

10:39.594 --> 10:41.061
If he had pulled
that trigger,

10:41.063 --> 10:42.662
I don't even think he could
have pulled the trigger,

10:42.664 --> 10:43.996
he was so jacked up.

10:43.998 --> 10:44.731
But if he had, I...

10:44.733 --> 10:45.765
Nah. Nah. Nah.

10:45.767 --> 10:47.568
You did the right thing.

10:47.570 --> 10:48.637
How you feeling? You okay?

10:49.371 --> 10:51.741
Hey. Hey, John! John!

10:53.276 --> 10:55.042
I don't wanna make it
a big deal or nothing,

10:55.044 --> 10:56.175
but we all pitched in

10:56.177 --> 10:57.679
and got a little something
for you.

10:59.147 --> 11:02.082
Oh, shit.
The big 4-0.

11:02.084 --> 11:03.884
All downhill from here.

11:03.886 --> 11:05.221
Mm-hmm.

11:14.763 --> 11:17.599
We have to put all of
them in because Daddy's here.

11:21.237 --> 11:24.071
Happy birthday!

11:24.073 --> 11:27.274
Oh, man! What is this?

11:27.276 --> 11:29.576
- A surprise!
- Why didn't you tell me?

11:29.578 --> 11:32.612
Because then it wouldn't
have been a surprise!

11:32.614 --> 11:34.614
Cake for breakfast?

11:35.917 --> 11:38.217
Birthday cake for breakfast?

11:38.219 --> 11:40.220
Sweetheart,
whose idea was this?

11:40.222 --> 11:42.458
Oh, it was their idea.

11:48.030 --> 11:50.767
I tried telling them.

11:52.066 --> 11:54.101
Dad's going to be cranky,

11:54.103 --> 11:56.871
and he's not gonna want anyone
bringing up his age.

11:56.873 --> 11:58.105
"Dear Mr. President..."

11:58.107 --> 11:59.639
They said they didn't care.

11:59.641 --> 12:01.308
"...I was sorry to hear
that you got shot,

12:01.310 --> 12:03.943
and I'm happy to hear
that you're feeling better."

12:03.945 --> 12:05.111
What about you?

12:07.583 --> 12:09.084
It's your birthday.

12:10.151 --> 12:11.583
I'm not saying a thing.

12:11.585 --> 12:12.785
"I know
you probably can't tell me

12:12.787 --> 12:14.121
"because it's a secret,

12:14.123 --> 12:16.555
"but I bet there are
lots of them

12:16.557 --> 12:19.425
"and wonder if you play hide
and seek with the visitors.

12:19.427 --> 12:22.996
"I hope to visit some day
and think it would be fun.

12:22.998 --> 12:25.164
"Thank you
for making America safe.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.634
Yours truly, Abilene Hunt."

12:32.474 --> 12:34.377
<i>Car 22, do you copy?</i>

12:35.377 --> 12:37.510
<i>Car 22, this is Dispatch.
Do you copy?</i>

12:37.512 --> 12:41.381
Babe, push that red button
and tell them, "10-4."

12:41.383 --> 12:42.683
10-4.

12:42.685 --> 12:45.119
Say, "10-4, good buddy."

12:45.121 --> 12:48.524
- 10-4, good buddy.
- Hey, I wanna do it!

12:49.992 --> 12:53.125
Dude, tell her...
push the red button...

12:53.127 --> 12:56.996
and say, "Dispatch,
this is Robbery 7."

12:56.998 --> 12:59.131
Dispatch, this is Robbery 7.

12:59.133 --> 13:00.332
<i>Please stop messing around.</i>

13:00.334 --> 13:03.269
Say, "I gotta go...
10-2 real bad."

13:03.271 --> 13:05.440
I gotta go 10-2 real bad.

13:06.174 --> 13:07.677
Wait, what's 10-2?

13:12.047 --> 13:13.380
All right,
you wanna wait in the car

13:13.382 --> 13:14.448
or you wanna come in?

13:14.450 --> 13:15.848
- Come in.
- Wait.

13:15.850 --> 13:17.351
Can I have the keys
so I can listen to the radio?

13:17.353 --> 13:19.419
Yeah. And write
a note to your teacher

13:19.421 --> 13:21.722
because we're all
going to be late.

13:21.724 --> 13:22.757
Got it.

13:23.725 --> 13:24.759
Come on.

13:28.497 --> 13:30.900
Come on, buddy! 10-2.
Let's go!

14:19.247 --> 14:21.217
Who you praying to this time?

14:21.950 --> 14:24.016
Our Lady of, uh...

14:24.018 --> 14:26.886
Rare and Periodic Attendance.

14:30.191 --> 14:32.024
So, it's your choice,
all right?

14:32.026 --> 14:33.025
You gotta choose?

14:33.027 --> 14:34.193
Yeah!

14:34.195 --> 14:36.763
Okay, so then pick
whatever you want.

14:36.765 --> 14:38.531
I mean, you liked baseball,
didn't you?

14:38.533 --> 14:41.002
- Yeah.
- Okay, so pick baseball.

14:41.770 --> 14:44.004
Just pick
whatever you want to pick.

14:44.006 --> 14:45.405
That's... that's the most
important thing.

14:45.407 --> 14:47.140
Do the thing
that you want to do.

14:47.142 --> 14:49.076
But make sure that
you actually like it,

14:49.078 --> 14:50.177
you know what I mean?

14:50.179 --> 14:51.745
'Cause you're stuck with it.

14:51.747 --> 14:53.516
Why are you looking
at me like that?

14:56.384 --> 14:58.117
Do you like your job?

14:58.119 --> 15:00.953
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Can I see the manager?

15:00.955 --> 15:02.222
Well, that would be me.

15:02.224 --> 15:03.789
What can I do for you
this morning?

15:03.791 --> 15:05.725
Well, I'd like to ask
about a business loan.

15:05.727 --> 15:08.361
Well, sure. I bet
we can help you with that.

15:08.363 --> 15:11.334
Uh, what sort of business
are we talking about?

15:12.367 --> 15:14.067
Oh.

15:14.069 --> 15:15.671
This kind.

15:26.348 --> 15:27.683
Sit down.

15:29.718 --> 15:31.286
Dad, I'm bored.

15:32.054 --> 15:33.623
What do you want me to do?

15:39.895 --> 15:41.697
So, how are you feeling today?

15:43.398 --> 15:45.868
Not so good,
since you're asking.

15:47.335 --> 15:48.671
Well, the day's still young.

15:55.544 --> 15:57.313
I'm going
to give this to you.

15:58.347 --> 16:01.851
And what I want you to do
is fill it with money.

16:02.783 --> 16:04.150
You ever hear
about that frog

16:04.152 --> 16:05.619
that went to the bank
right there?

16:05.621 --> 16:06.653
No.

16:06.655 --> 16:08.690
A frog walked
into a bank one day.

16:09.891 --> 16:12.192
And he walks right up to
the teller. "May I speak..."

16:12.194 --> 16:14.026
Here they got a nameplate
and his name,

16:14.028 --> 16:16.261
it says Mr. Paddywhack on it.

16:16.263 --> 16:17.329
He walks up to him
and he says,

16:17.331 --> 16:18.731
"Excuse me, Mr. Paddywhack.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.833
"I'd like to talk to someone
about taking out a loan."

16:20.835 --> 16:23.605
And Mr. Paddywhack looked
at him and he said...

16:24.573 --> 16:26.809
"You can't get a loan.
You're just a frog."

16:27.542 --> 16:29.608
And the frog says,
"That doesn't seem fair.

16:29.610 --> 16:31.577
Would you go please speak
to your manager?"

16:31.579 --> 16:32.912
So Mr. Paddywhack went back

16:32.914 --> 16:35.314
and he talked to the manager
and he said...

16:35.316 --> 16:37.116
"Sir, there's a frog out there

16:37.118 --> 16:39.553
who's asking
about taking out a loan."

16:39.555 --> 16:41.587
And his, uh, manager said,

16:41.589 --> 16:43.591
"Well, does he have
any collateral?"

16:44.526 --> 16:47.659
Collateral is something
you can, uh, get if you're...

16:47.661 --> 16:50.333
hold on to to make sure that
people give their money back.

16:51.366 --> 16:53.766
And he said,
"I don't know. I'll go ask."

16:53.768 --> 16:54.903
And he sat down.

16:56.238 --> 16:58.270
He goes back out to the frog
and he says,

16:58.272 --> 16:59.675
"Do you have any collateral?"

17:01.310 --> 17:05.611
And, uh, the frog took out this
little teeny, tiny glass pear,

17:05.613 --> 17:07.781
and he puts it on the counter
and he said...

17:07.782 --> 17:10.684
"That glass pear is all
I have in the world."

17:10.685 --> 17:12.718
And then Mr. Paddywhack
takes it back

17:12.720 --> 17:14.021
to his manager and he says...

17:14.022 --> 17:16.589
So, we'll switch that
from checking to savings?

17:16.590 --> 17:19.059
"Sir, this is all
the frog has in the world."

17:19.060 --> 17:20.092
Thank you.

17:20.094 --> 17:21.227
The manager
looks at him,

17:21.229 --> 17:22.396
and he looks
at the little glass pear,

17:22.397 --> 17:23.766
and he says...

17:27.768 --> 17:30.269
He says, "It's a knick-knack,
Paddywhack.

17:30.271 --> 17:31.740
Give the frog a loan."

17:33.074 --> 17:35.342
- You get it?
- Yeah.

17:35.344 --> 17:36.746
I'd like to make a deposit.

17:37.746 --> 17:40.147
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:40.149 --> 17:42.015
Please remain calm.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.883
It is my duty to inform you...

17:44.885 --> 17:47.254
that this bank
has just been robbed.

17:50.991 --> 17:51.991
Step on it.

17:58.834 --> 18:01.801
Now, everybody just...
Helen, I can handle this.

18:01.803 --> 18:03.704
- Sir, you cannot leave.
- Sir! My daughter's in the car outside.

18:03.706 --> 18:05.470
- The police are on their way.
- Listen... listen...

18:05.472 --> 18:07.040
Okay. I am the...
I'm with the...

18:07.042 --> 18:08.475
The police
will be here momentarily.

18:08.477 --> 18:09.641
You're not listening
to what I'm telling you!

18:09.643 --> 18:11.778
I'm with
the police department.

18:17.251 --> 18:20.655
John? What the hell
are you doing here?

18:41.509 --> 18:42.876
Did you see anybody funny

18:42.878 --> 18:44.576
or something
that looked out of place?

18:44.578 --> 18:47.246
So, how old exactly?

18:47.248 --> 18:50.182
Oh, I'd say
he was about 50 or 60?

18:50.184 --> 18:52.552
- Closer to 60?
- Yeah.

18:52.554 --> 18:56.859
- Or 50?
- Yeah. Uh, 50 to 60.

18:57.892 --> 18:59.661
Sound about right
to you, John?

19:00.495 --> 19:01.897
Mm-hmm.

19:09.371 --> 19:11.304
So what happened?

19:11.306 --> 19:12.971
Are you guys, okay?

19:12.973 --> 19:15.074
Um...

19:15.076 --> 19:16.376
You said he was armed?

19:16.378 --> 19:18.011
Yes, he had a gun.

19:18.013 --> 19:20.112
- You saw it?
- Yes!

19:20.114 --> 19:22.248
- He pointed it at you?
- Well, I... Well, no!

19:22.250 --> 19:23.816
But he said
he had one! And I...

19:23.818 --> 19:25.686
- You did what he said.
- Yes!

19:25.688 --> 19:29.757
- Because he said he had a gun.
- Yes. And also...

19:31.892 --> 19:34.796
I mean, he was also
sort of a gentleman.

20:17.105 --> 20:19.639
She don't speak
a lick of English.

20:19.641 --> 20:22.774
And I don't know but one
or two words in Spanish,

20:22.776 --> 20:26.278
both of which
I employ liberally and...

20:26.280 --> 20:27.882
We seem to get along
just fine.

20:28.784 --> 20:30.883
<i>Bueno para ti.</i>

20:30.885 --> 20:33.721
What am I supposed
to say to that? <i>Si?</i>

20:34.757 --> 20:37.957
<i>Si. Absolutamente.</i>

20:37.959 --> 20:40.860
Oh, man. I know
when I'm being made fun of,

20:40.862 --> 20:43.330
and I'm okay
with that because

20:43.332 --> 20:46.565
I've got a good sense
of humor about myself, sir.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.534
I've got a good sense
of humor about you, too.

20:48.536 --> 20:51.036
Yeah, right. Get the hell out.

20:51.038 --> 20:54.640
She wants me to take her...

20:54.642 --> 20:56.778
...down to Buenos Aires.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.345
- You ever been down there?
- Nope.

20:59.347 --> 21:02.180
Well, apparently they've got
some really good poetry.

21:02.182 --> 21:04.185
You're thinking of Chile.

21:05.621 --> 21:08.353
What's the difference?

21:08.355 --> 21:10.957
What about St. Louis?
You ever been to St. Louis?

21:10.959 --> 21:12.257
Sure.

21:12.259 --> 21:14.194
I got an idea for
a pretty good score up there.

21:14.196 --> 21:17.697
<i>...19 high school
ROTC cadets from Lubbock.</i>

21:17.699 --> 21:20.534
<i>The man put his charges to bed
at 9:30 on Friday,</i>

21:20.536 --> 21:23.069
<i>put on his snow shoes, and
walked down the mountain to...</i>

21:23.071 --> 21:24.273
Is it on the news?

21:25.305 --> 21:27.774
<i>In local news today... bees!</i>

21:27.776 --> 21:31.279
Nope. Nobody cares.

21:33.448 --> 21:34.783
Well, you care.

21:35.549 --> 21:37.450
- Don't you?
- Trying to.

21:37.452 --> 21:40.920
I can't figure out if I need
to try a whole lot harder

21:40.922 --> 21:43.191
or if I should just quit.

21:44.025 --> 21:46.159
So, you gonna quit
and do what?

21:46.161 --> 21:49.094
I really don't know.
Something useful.

21:49.096 --> 21:50.764
Something where I don't have
to clean up a mess

21:50.766 --> 21:53.102
that keeps on making itself
every time I turn around.

21:54.169 --> 21:56.805
Okay. You can quit.

21:57.872 --> 21:59.741
Or you can try and catch 'em.

22:14.623 --> 22:16.959
I didn't think
you'd ever actually call.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.627
I didn't think you'd pick up.
So we're even.

22:22.229 --> 22:24.497
- So, how's your truck?
- Oh, it's all fixed up.

22:24.499 --> 22:27.167
- Yeah?
- Yeah. How about you?

22:27.169 --> 22:28.700
You've been traveling
a lot, I guess?

22:28.702 --> 22:30.035
Oh, yeah.

22:30.037 --> 22:31.603
Selling a lot of Bibles?

22:31.605 --> 22:32.971
Yeah. A whole lot.

22:32.973 --> 22:34.873
You're looking at one
of the top five salesmen

22:34.875 --> 22:36.409
in the area right here.

22:36.411 --> 22:37.813
- Yeah?
- Yup.

22:39.148 --> 22:41.350
I don't believe
a word you say.

22:42.284 --> 22:43.752
Probably a good idea.

22:46.653 --> 22:48.455
You aren't wearing
your hearing aid.

22:48.457 --> 22:49.855
Hmm?

22:49.857 --> 22:51.757
You're not wearing
your hearing aid!

22:51.759 --> 22:53.092
I'm sorry, I can't hear ya.

22:53.094 --> 22:54.459
You're not wearing your...

22:54.461 --> 22:55.998
God.

22:58.933 --> 23:01.936
Hey. Got something for ya.

23:07.342 --> 23:08.443
John Hunt!

23:09.209 --> 23:12.014
John Hunt, where is he?
There he is.

23:12.847 --> 23:15.081
Looks like your
rainy-day robber is at it again.

23:15.083 --> 23:18.083
Laugh it up, Columbo.
What do you got?

23:18.085 --> 23:21.920
Gene Dentler sent that over.
Said it made him think of you.

23:21.922 --> 23:24.055
That's hilarious.

23:24.057 --> 23:25.358
Don't you worry about it, man.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.963
I've already got the AARP
on the case.

23:32.566 --> 23:33.867
Hello. Gene.

23:33.869 --> 23:35.434
Hey, Gene Dentler.
It's John Hunt here.

23:35.436 --> 23:36.836
<i>Tell me about this robbery.</i>

23:36.838 --> 23:38.571
Oh, you mean the old guy?

23:38.573 --> 23:42.774
Yeah, same story. Small haul.
No prints, no MO, no nothing.

23:42.776 --> 23:44.476
So you got no leads, huh?

23:44.478 --> 23:45.879
What a fucking surprise.

23:45.881 --> 23:48.380
Mainly on account
of nobody giving a shit.

23:48.382 --> 23:50.749
It's just kind
of a funny story.

23:50.751 --> 23:53.285
Yeah. Nothing funnier
than armed robbery.

23:53.287 --> 23:54.920
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:54.922 --> 23:56.555
<i>Oh, you know,
speaking of funny...</i>

23:56.557 --> 23:58.957
here's where
it gets interesting.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.159
I told my wife
about the whole deal.

24:01.161 --> 24:02.829
And I guess
she tells her sister,

24:02.831 --> 24:05.063
'cause the next day,
her sister calls me

24:05.065 --> 24:07.600
and she told me about a thing
she read in the paper

24:07.602 --> 24:09.636
that sounds real similar.

24:09.638 --> 24:11.871
Old guy... with a gun.

24:11.873 --> 24:15.076
Oh, yeah? What's your, uh,
your wife's sister's name?

24:16.478 --> 24:17.643
Hello, Marge.
I'm calling about

24:17.645 --> 24:18.945
this robbery you had
on June 8th.

24:18.947 --> 24:20.880
Is that case still open?

24:22.216 --> 24:24.584
Yes, ma'am. Would you fax it
to me? Thank you.

24:25.353 --> 24:27.555
Now, what do you mean
when you say more than one?

24:28.989 --> 24:29.989
Two?

24:34.062 --> 24:35.794
Excuse me.

24:35.796 --> 24:36.862
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

24:36.864 --> 24:38.296
I'd like to open up
an account.

24:38.298 --> 24:41.766
Oh, great. What type of account
do you have in mind?

24:41.768 --> 24:43.438
This kind.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.108
This kind.

24:47.808 --> 24:49.476
This kind.

24:59.621 --> 25:00.621
This enough for you?

25:01.721 --> 25:03.257
Keep 'em coming,
please, Patty.

25:14.102 --> 25:16.138
God! Can I get some help?

25:17.605 --> 25:19.772
<i>Okay, what we have here
is five states.</i>

25:19.774 --> 25:21.373
- 93 robberies.
- In two years.

25:21.375 --> 25:23.342
And you think
it's all the same guys?

25:23.344 --> 25:24.310
Hundred percent.

25:24.312 --> 25:25.812
So, how do
the same three guys

25:25.814 --> 25:27.179
get away with all that?

25:27.181 --> 25:28.348
<i>Well, they haven't
gotten away with it.</i>

25:28.350 --> 25:30.216
<i>They just haven't
been caught yet.</i>

25:30.218 --> 25:31.551
<i>So, what do you want to do?</i>

25:31.553 --> 25:32.650
- What do we want to do?
- Yeah.

25:32.652 --> 25:33.585
We're going to catch 'em.

25:33.587 --> 25:34.589
We're going to catch 'em.

25:41.129 --> 25:42.164
Hello.

26:07.087 --> 26:10.258
Oh. You crying? Don't cry.

26:10.991 --> 26:12.659
What are you crying for?

26:12.661 --> 26:14.627
This is my first day.

26:14.629 --> 26:15.861
Well, there's always
a first time

26:15.863 --> 26:17.132
for everything, isn't there?

26:19.133 --> 26:20.134
Chin up.

26:22.769 --> 26:24.038
Okay.

26:25.506 --> 26:27.209
You're doing a great job.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.848
<i>And how would you
describe him?</i>

26:35.850 --> 26:38.921
Well, he was, uh...
he was very polite.

26:40.220 --> 26:42.988
He seemed like
a nice enough fella.

26:42.990 --> 26:45.257
- He was...
- Let me guess.

26:45.259 --> 26:48.561
- Uh, he was a gentleman.
- Well, yeah.

26:48.563 --> 26:50.265
But he was more...

26:51.665 --> 26:54.235
- He just seemed happy.
- Happy?

26:55.737 --> 26:57.005
Yeah.

26:57.972 --> 27:00.942
Did he look like either
of these two guys here?

27:02.411 --> 27:04.811
Yeah. Sorta. I gue...

27:04.813 --> 27:08.050
He... he just seemed more...

27:09.750 --> 27:11.085
Happy.

27:34.008 --> 27:35.309
Come on!

27:38.912 --> 27:40.446
It looks terrible now

27:40.448 --> 27:41.947
because I started
stripping the paper off

27:41.949 --> 27:43.181
thinking I'd change it.

27:43.183 --> 27:46.585
But then I found this
on the plaster...

27:46.587 --> 27:49.354
and I couldn't bring myself
to cover it up.

27:49.356 --> 27:52.057
I looked it up. That's the guy
that built this house.

27:52.059 --> 27:54.092
He signed that
about 100 years ago,

27:54.094 --> 27:55.730
and it's still there.

27:58.799 --> 28:01.133
Wiley here,
I've had since he was born

28:01.135 --> 28:03.101
and Clementine...

28:03.103 --> 28:04.469
Clementine belonged
to our neighbors,

28:04.471 --> 28:06.605
but she kept busting
through our fence.

28:06.607 --> 28:07.640
So, we...

28:07.642 --> 28:09.344
We finally just gave up
and bought her.

28:11.246 --> 28:14.813
So... all this
belongs to you, huh?

28:14.815 --> 28:16.549
Yup.

28:16.551 --> 28:18.186
- Wow.
- Me and the bank.

28:20.621 --> 28:21.821
Hmm.

28:21.823 --> 28:23.691
My kids keep telling me
to sell it,

28:24.725 --> 28:25.957
but I love it too much.

28:27.795 --> 28:29.461
They say
it's too expensive

28:29.463 --> 28:32.800
or that it's too much for me
to handle on my own, but...

28:33.901 --> 28:36.267
I say, well, come on out

28:36.269 --> 28:37.805
and give me a hand, then.

28:39.739 --> 28:41.175
I'm not going anywhere.

28:44.746 --> 28:46.148
You're not married, are ya?

28:46.948 --> 28:48.850
No... Me? No.

28:49.616 --> 28:51.819
I was once though.
That was when I was young.

28:53.054 --> 28:54.488
Got any kids?

28:56.356 --> 28:57.792
I hope not.

29:01.328 --> 29:02.995
- 75...
- Yeah.

29:02.997 --> 29:04.229
- ...76...
- Yes.

29:04.231 --> 29:05.296
- ...77...
- Yup.

29:05.298 --> 29:06.533
Can I have a sip of your beer?

29:06.535 --> 29:07.699
No. Go.

29:07.701 --> 29:11.003
78, 79, 80.

29:11.005 --> 29:13.104
80.
Okay, what comes after 80?

29:13.106 --> 29:14.540
- 81.
- 81.

29:14.542 --> 29:16.609
Now that's a trail.
You see a trail?

29:16.611 --> 29:17.543
Yeah.

29:17.545 --> 29:18.910
But where's the trail lead?

29:18.912 --> 29:20.213
The bad guy.

29:20.215 --> 29:21.550
To the bad guy.

29:22.350 --> 29:24.186
Now, where's
that bad guy going?

30:20.240 --> 30:22.610
Can we get two more coffees
over here, please?

30:25.046 --> 30:27.414
- How was the drive?
- Long.

30:28.216 --> 30:30.015
- Long.
- Romantic.

30:30.017 --> 30:32.554
Romantic?

30:34.421 --> 30:36.288
He didn't like
my book-on-tape.

31:19.866 --> 31:20.901
It's big.

31:23.871 --> 31:25.207
Real big.

31:28.442 --> 31:31.645
What I want to know is how
much they got in that truck.

31:38.952 --> 31:40.253
I'd like to talk to somebody

31:40.255 --> 31:41.823
about opening an IRA.

32:06.313 --> 32:08.647
Hi. Can you cash this
for me please?

32:08.649 --> 32:09.916
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

32:09.918 --> 32:11.386
- Will that be all?
- Yeah.

32:26.234 --> 32:27.399
I see all my friends
buying homes

32:27.401 --> 32:28.934
and doing
these grown up things

32:28.936 --> 32:31.773
that shouldn't have seemed
so big to me, but...

32:32.573 --> 32:33.773
when I'd add everything up,

32:33.775 --> 32:35.610
it just didn't make
any sense until...

32:36.844 --> 32:38.611
Oh, until now,

32:38.613 --> 32:40.178
and everything's
settled down...

32:41.315 --> 32:44.016
Sir. Sir, your cash.

32:44.018 --> 32:45.484
Oh. Thank you.

32:45.486 --> 32:47.055
...they're
in their right place.

32:48.956 --> 32:51.792
Oh, I'm a kid. My dad leaves.

32:52.526 --> 32:57.662
And when I turned a teenager,
my, uh, mom remarried.

32:57.664 --> 33:01.365
And she remarried
to a cop, so...

33:01.367 --> 33:04.035
- A cop?
- Christ, I know.

33:04.037 --> 33:07.605
I'm already doing petty crime
and that type of thing.

33:07.607 --> 33:09.507
Anyway, the first thing
he does is

33:09.509 --> 33:12.276
he changes all the locks
on the house.

33:12.278 --> 33:15.880
And, uh, and he writes
a 30-page manifesto

33:15.882 --> 33:20.252
about what's gonna happen
now that he's in charge.

33:20.254 --> 33:24.390
And things that we have to do,
things we can no longer do,

33:24.392 --> 33:25.658
that type of thing.

33:25.660 --> 33:27.226
Well, anyways,
it's Christmastime.

33:27.228 --> 33:29.829
I go out drinking,
I come home late.

33:29.831 --> 33:32.497
The house is locked up
like a federal prison.

33:32.499 --> 33:33.832
I...

33:33.834 --> 33:36.369
The only window available
to me is a high window,

33:36.371 --> 33:38.303
and I get up
into the high window

33:38.305 --> 33:39.737
and I get halfway through

33:39.739 --> 33:41.340
and I start losing my balance

33:41.342 --> 33:43.809
and I'm hanging on
to the Christmas tree.

33:43.811 --> 33:48.013
And the balls are falling
and the tinsels are tinseling.

33:48.015 --> 33:49.581
And I see through the tinsel,

33:49.583 --> 33:53.186
I see my stepfather
in his whitey-tighties

33:53.188 --> 33:55.254
in a combat position

33:55.256 --> 33:57.755
with both hands
on his revolver,

33:57.757 --> 34:00.492
and he's ready to squeeze
one off. And he says...

34:00.494 --> 34:04.763
"Freeze! Freeze, sailor!"

34:04.765 --> 34:07.332
He's never referred to me
as sailor before.

34:07.334 --> 34:09.368
It was a first.

34:09.370 --> 34:14.040
So I... Things got worse
from there and...

34:14.042 --> 34:15.810
And that's why
I hate Christmas.

34:22.449 --> 34:24.216
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey! It's me.

34:24.217 --> 34:25.484
<i>Oh, hello!</i>

34:25.485 --> 34:27.386
Is it too late for me to call?

34:27.388 --> 34:29.524
<i>No, it's...
it's not that late.</i>

34:30.857 --> 34:33.558
- So, what are you doing?
- <i>Just sitting at home,</i>

34:33.560 --> 34:36.428
<i>paying bills, procrastinating.</i>

34:36.429 --> 34:39.697
- Just waiting for me to call?
- <i>Careful, now.</i>

34:39.699 --> 34:41.234
<i>Where are you anyway?</i>

34:41.967 --> 34:45.170
Oh, somewhere in Oklahoma
or Missouri, I don't know.

34:45.172 --> 34:46.875
It all seems the same to me.

34:48.109 --> 34:51.746
So, you wanna come find me?

34:54.348 --> 34:55.947
So, the vault.

34:55.949 --> 34:58.685
- The vault and the truck.
- Hmm.

34:59.585 --> 35:01.620
You really think
we can do it?

35:01.622 --> 35:03.656
Yeah, I think
we can probably do it.

35:03.658 --> 35:05.991
We can probably do
anything we set our minds to.

35:05.993 --> 35:09.462
I'm just saying, it sounds
like we're showing off.

35:09.464 --> 35:11.496
Well, let's show off then.

35:11.498 --> 35:13.431
I'm so tired of doing
the same score

35:13.433 --> 35:15.132
over and over again.

35:15.134 --> 35:17.169
It's penny-ante bullshit.

35:17.171 --> 35:19.304
I'm gonna be 67 years old.

35:19.306 --> 35:20.841
My bones hurt.

35:22.243 --> 35:23.978
Jesus Christ.

35:25.846 --> 35:27.882
I'm gonna start thinking
about my future.

35:28.950 --> 35:30.051
My future.

35:31.852 --> 35:33.752
What are you thinking,
Forrest?

35:33.754 --> 35:35.856
Do you think
we can pull it off?

35:36.658 --> 35:39.093
- Yeah, probably.
- Probably?

35:40.194 --> 35:41.996
Probably?

35:43.163 --> 35:44.899
You forget about Paterson?

35:45.632 --> 35:47.433
Probably didn't get you
very far then.

35:47.435 --> 35:50.138
Yeah, but that was then.
This is now.

35:50.870 --> 35:53.272
And now,
I know what I'm doing.

35:53.274 --> 35:54.438
Yeah, I know, too.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.843
But I also know
what I'm capable of.

35:57.578 --> 36:00.946
And these days, those are
two different things.

36:02.216 --> 36:03.582
I don't have to calm down.

36:03.584 --> 36:04.984
No, don't touch me.

36:05.852 --> 36:07.286
I don't want to be cool.

36:07.288 --> 36:09.587
Just...
Would you be quiet?

36:09.589 --> 36:11.223
What is wrong
with my voice?

36:11.225 --> 36:12.424
What do I need
to be quiet for?

36:12.426 --> 36:15.729
You should take me home.
Your brother is...

36:16.564 --> 36:17.862
He tried to grab my boobs!

36:17.864 --> 36:19.598
What kind of man
lets his brother

36:19.600 --> 36:21.199
try to touch someone's boobs?

36:21.201 --> 36:22.569
He's 13...

36:29.877 --> 36:31.277
<i>...controlled but caused</i>

36:31.279 --> 36:34.112
<i>heavy damage to the building
and its contents.</i>

36:34.114 --> 36:35.446
<i>The arson inspectors say</i>

36:35.448 --> 36:38.650
<i>there were several points
of instigation for the fire,</i>

36:38.652 --> 36:40.622
<i>and foul play
has not been ruled out.</i>

36:41.355 --> 36:42.922
<i>We now go to Dallas, Texas,</i>

36:42.924 --> 36:45.056
<i>where police from
multiple states have traced</i>

36:45.058 --> 36:47.725
<i>a series of dozens
of bank robberies</i>

36:47.727 --> 36:50.495
<i>to a band of
highly skilled robbers.</i>

36:50.497 --> 36:53.065
<i>Making this crime spree
even more unusual?</i>

36:53.067 --> 36:55.500
<i>These suspects are
a little bit older</i>

36:55.502 --> 36:57.236
<i>than your average criminals.</i>

36:57.238 --> 36:58.804
<i>Well,
we figure them to be about</i>

36:58.806 --> 37:00.437
<i>60 to 70 years old.</i>

37:00.439 --> 37:02.775
<i>For that reason, we're calling
them "The Over the Hill Gang."</i>

37:02.777 --> 37:04.676
<i>- Good name.
- Thank you.</i>

37:04.678 --> 37:06.178
<i>We came up with that.</i>

37:06.180 --> 37:07.446
<i>Folks from all around,</i>

37:07.448 --> 37:08.681
<i>some from Albuquerque
and Little Rock</i>

37:08.683 --> 37:09.781
<i>just putting
our heads together</i>

37:09.783 --> 37:11.516
<i>and hoping to nab
these guys.</i>

37:11.518 --> 37:12.984
<i>So, old men robbing banks,</i>

37:12.986 --> 37:14.920
<i>it seems like
they'd be fairly conspicuous.</i>

37:14.922 --> 37:17.589
<i>Any idea how they'd gotten
away with it for so long?</i>

37:17.591 --> 37:19.058
<i>Well, no.</i>

37:19.060 --> 37:20.725
<i>But frankly, they have
a whole lot more experience</i>

37:20.727 --> 37:22.761
<i>robbing banks than we do
catching them.</i>

37:22.763 --> 37:24.228
<i>Think you'll be
the one to catch 'em?</i>

37:24.230 --> 37:26.332
<i>Uh, I think
that any of these fellas here</i>

37:26.334 --> 37:28.766
<i>who put in long hours
and done some real hard work</i>

37:28.768 --> 37:30.301
<i>would like to do the job.</i>

37:30.303 --> 37:31.904
<i>But, yeah, I won't lie.</i>

37:31.906 --> 37:34.007
<i>I'd love to slap the cuffs
on them myself.</i>

37:35.676 --> 37:37.743
<i>I hope that happens.
I hope I get the chance.</i>

37:37.745 --> 37:39.111
<i>Here's hoping time
doesn't catch up with them</i>

37:39.113 --> 37:40.178
<i>before you do.</i>

37:40.180 --> 37:41.913
<i>- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks, Detective.</i>

37:41.915 --> 37:43.951
<i>- Thank you.
- Ted, back to you.</i>

37:50.957 --> 37:52.660
Hey, back already?

37:55.730 --> 37:57.362
You see the news?

37:57.364 --> 37:58.596
No.

37:58.598 --> 37:59.901
How's the weather?

38:01.201 --> 38:02.337
Blue skies.

38:15.082 --> 38:17.819
Hello?

38:25.326 --> 38:26.725
You gotta be kidding me.

38:40.942 --> 38:42.775
So, you can take
a look on the tapes.

38:42.777 --> 38:45.810
They just sweep right in,
lockstep with the guards.

38:45.812 --> 38:47.948
It's like they were escorting
them to the vaults.

38:50.084 --> 38:51.285
Detective?

38:52.719 --> 38:54.488
Detective Hunt?
We're this way.

38:55.455 --> 38:58.522
Um. Yeah, so, most people didn't
even know what was going on.

38:58.524 --> 38:59.924
- Is this John Hunt?
- Yeah.

38:59.926 --> 39:01.960
You're the talk
of the town, Detective.

39:01.962 --> 39:03.295
I gotta get
this straight. Okay.

39:03.297 --> 39:05.998
First, you followed them
into the street, right?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.466
Yes.

39:07.468 --> 39:09.301
And then you fired at them?

39:09.303 --> 39:11.737
Yeah. Like I said, two times.

39:11.739 --> 39:13.170
- Gold?
- Gold.

39:13.172 --> 39:14.406
Uh-huh.

39:14.408 --> 39:16.007
Well, what do you think
they're gonna do with gold?

39:16.009 --> 39:18.143
You tell me. And they'd have
gotten away scot-free

39:18.145 --> 39:20.114
except one of them stopped
to leave this.

39:23.850 --> 39:25.987
That is one hell
of a souvenir.

39:27.154 --> 39:31.125
They took off
one of my love handles.

39:33.227 --> 39:37.429
You know, I never actually
finished medical school.

39:37.431 --> 39:38.763
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

39:38.765 --> 39:40.598
Don't tell me that, boy.

39:49.176 --> 39:50.674
<i>We have some breaking news</i>

39:50.676 --> 39:52.143
<i>to tell you about right now.</i>

39:52.145 --> 39:54.712
<i>Police are looking
for three suspects</i>

39:54.714 --> 39:57.047
<i>who attempted to rob
First Nation's Bank...</i>

39:59.352 --> 40:00.851
How are you doing?

40:00.853 --> 40:02.924
Huh? I'm all right.

40:05.893 --> 40:08.096
We almost did it, didn't we?

40:09.428 --> 40:11.064
No, we did do it.

40:21.341 --> 40:23.009
<i>What are we
looking for here?</i>

40:25.480 --> 40:27.578
Stop right there.
Stop it. Go back.

40:27.580 --> 40:28.781
Wait till the guards go past.

40:28.783 --> 40:29.948
No, no. It's there.
It's there.

40:29.950 --> 40:31.783
You're moving forward.
Go back.

40:31.785 --> 40:33.585
It's slow motion.
It takes a second.

40:33.587 --> 40:35.120
You got to rewind it.

40:35.122 --> 40:36.187
It's rewinding.

40:36.189 --> 40:37.790
- You're going forward.
- There you go, see.

40:37.792 --> 40:38.857
Come on, man. Just push...

40:38.859 --> 40:40.326
You're not even...
you're pushing...

40:40.328 --> 40:42.361
- It's this one. Stop! Stop!
- Go back to where it was.

40:42.363 --> 40:44.730
Don't stop on an empty frame!
Stop on his face.

40:44.732 --> 40:46.434
There! Right there.
Stop right there.

40:48.602 --> 40:49.970
Look at that.

40:52.739 --> 40:54.408
Is he smiling?

40:55.875 --> 40:57.341
Must be thinkin' of you.

40:59.446 --> 41:01.082
- Detective Hunt?
- Yeah.

41:01.814 --> 41:03.150
Those the guys?

41:04.685 --> 41:05.949
Yeah.

41:05.951 --> 41:09.189
Hmm. Well, we're going
to need those tapes.

41:10.424 --> 41:12.089
These tapes are my evidence.

41:12.091 --> 41:14.592
Not any longer they're not.
It's a federal case now.

41:14.594 --> 41:15.995
Thank you very much.

41:16.930 --> 41:18.129
<i>You know,
the Bureau was actually</i>

41:18.131 --> 41:20.297
<i>put together
to catch guys like these.</i>

41:20.299 --> 41:21.165
Mm-hmm.

41:21.167 --> 41:23.234
There was Dillinger. Who else?

41:23.236 --> 41:25.872
Well, Dillinger and a bunch
of other guys like him.

41:26.674 --> 41:28.940
Point is,
you've done your part, John.

41:28.942 --> 41:31.011
You did a good job.

41:32.379 --> 41:33.946
Right.

41:33.948 --> 41:35.647
Hard part's over.

41:35.649 --> 41:37.919
Now's the part where
we bring this home.

41:40.187 --> 41:41.322
Mmm.

41:42.422 --> 41:44.591
Yeah? That could be.

41:45.593 --> 41:47.094
You could bring this home.

41:48.828 --> 41:50.995
Or it could be that
I puzzle things together.

41:50.997 --> 41:52.299
I find that clue.

41:53.234 --> 41:54.368
I crack the case.

41:55.167 --> 41:57.969
And maybe you come
to me and you say,

41:57.971 --> 41:59.536
"Thanks, John.
Let me shake your hand.

41:59.538 --> 42:02.509
"You puzzled things together.
You cracked the case.

42:04.310 --> 42:05.478
That's good work."

42:09.149 --> 42:10.317
You remember something?

42:11.285 --> 42:13.321
Uhh...

42:15.156 --> 42:16.224
No.

42:18.325 --> 42:20.891
But they want
the same thing you want.

42:20.893 --> 42:23.129
Yeah, that's true.

42:24.131 --> 42:26.498
So, why don't they
just let you do it?

42:26.500 --> 42:29.070
They think
that they can do it better.

42:29.904 --> 42:31.105
Can they?

42:32.439 --> 42:33.574
Probably.

42:41.647 --> 42:43.316
Can you get a tire iron, bud?

42:45.018 --> 42:46.884
Maybe it's a good thing.

42:46.886 --> 42:48.754
How's it a good thing?

42:48.756 --> 42:50.522
Because they aren't
as good as you are.

42:50.524 --> 42:51.790
So they won't catch him.

42:51.792 --> 42:53.558
Well, thank you, babe.

42:53.560 --> 42:54.926
And if it was your job,

42:54.928 --> 42:56.364
you would definitely
catch him.

42:57.163 --> 42:59.498
But that's why it's good
that you're not.

42:59.500 --> 43:00.866
Because if you caught him,

43:00.868 --> 43:02.603
you wouldn't get
to chase him anymore.

43:06.172 --> 43:07.941
I like how you think.

43:31.799 --> 43:33.334
That's that, isn't it?

43:35.835 --> 43:37.405
I'll be seeing you boys.

43:38.272 --> 43:39.674
Take care, Teddy.

43:44.812 --> 43:46.547
Say, I...

43:48.147 --> 43:51.419
Somethin' I've been meaning
to ask you and, uh...

43:53.687 --> 43:56.656
You got a place across
the street from a cemetery.

43:59.058 --> 44:00.792
For a reason?

44:00.794 --> 44:02.393
No.

44:02.395 --> 44:03.698
No. Okay.

44:05.565 --> 44:06.634
Okay.

44:07.901 --> 44:09.833
You really
never thought about it?

44:09.835 --> 44:11.339
No, not really.

44:12.872 --> 44:15.008
Okay. All right.

44:17.944 --> 44:19.243
I'll see you next week.

44:19.245 --> 44:23.383
And think
about laying low, okay.

44:24.317 --> 44:27.520
- All right.
- Bye, Forrest.

44:45.806 --> 44:47.041
John?

44:47.975 --> 44:50.578
Come on, John.
Don't look so sad, man.

44:51.911 --> 44:53.111
We don't need
to waste our time

44:53.113 --> 44:55.382
on a bunch
of old folks anyhow.

45:12.366 --> 45:13.366
What's that?

45:17.138 --> 45:18.372
Nothing.

45:34.087 --> 45:35.920
You sure
you don't want to try?

45:35.922 --> 45:37.290
Maybe next time.

45:38.091 --> 45:39.757
Thought this was
on your list?

45:39.759 --> 45:41.227
Oh, it still is.

45:43.062 --> 45:45.365
Come on. Come on.

45:49.136 --> 45:52.036
- So, do you miss him?
- Oh, sure.

45:52.038 --> 45:54.071
But we got married
when we were young.

45:54.073 --> 45:55.373
Like you did.

45:55.375 --> 45:58.079
And then the kids came and...

45:59.145 --> 46:02.115
Oh, you could kind of lose
track of yourself, you know.

46:03.984 --> 46:05.317
At least I do.

46:06.185 --> 46:08.353
And it's so easy to assume
that everything's fine.

46:08.355 --> 46:09.920
That this is fine.
This is the way

46:09.922 --> 46:11.091
things are supposed to be.

46:11.825 --> 46:15.192
And so, you spend so much time
thinking you're happy,

46:15.194 --> 46:16.627
and then one day you wake up
and you realize,

46:16.629 --> 46:19.667
oh, maybe you aren't.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.169
Maybe you never were
in the first place.

46:24.904 --> 46:27.707
Maybe you don't
even know what that means.

46:29.308 --> 46:32.611
Then something happens,
like you lose someone or...

46:33.379 --> 46:35.647
even your kids grow up
and leave home,

46:35.649 --> 46:37.118
and you think...

46:38.352 --> 46:40.120
"What do I have left?"

46:40.853 --> 46:42.687
So, yeah, I miss him.

46:42.689 --> 46:45.522
And there's a part of me
that always will, but...

46:45.524 --> 46:49.629
now I think,
now it's okay to be selfish.

46:51.732 --> 46:53.098
'Cause you think about...

46:53.100 --> 46:54.866
ten years from now,
where will you be?

46:54.868 --> 46:55.969
What'll you be doing?

46:56.703 --> 46:59.337
Now, whenever I close
the door, I think...

46:59.339 --> 47:01.239
"Oh, at least this is
the last time

47:01.241 --> 47:02.973
"I'll ever have
a chance to do

47:02.975 --> 47:04.678
whatever that thing was?"

47:05.444 --> 47:07.446
You know what I do
when the door closes?

47:07.448 --> 47:09.681
- What's that?
- I jump out the window.

47:12.951 --> 47:14.152
And look, if I ever wonder

47:14.154 --> 47:15.420
what I'm doing
or where I'm going,

47:15.422 --> 47:17.288
I just think of myself
as that little kid I was

47:17.290 --> 47:18.790
when I was just about
this tall.

47:18.792 --> 47:20.290
And I say, well...

47:20.292 --> 47:22.262
now would he have been
proud of me?

47:23.296 --> 47:25.029
And if the answer is no,

47:25.031 --> 47:27.265
well, then I just
keep walking on through.

47:27.267 --> 47:30.134
But if the answer is yes,
then I know I'm exactly

47:30.136 --> 47:31.639
where I'm supposed to be.

47:34.707 --> 47:37.544
So, is he proud of ya?
That little boy?

47:39.279 --> 47:41.379
Oh, he's getting closer
every day.

47:41.381 --> 47:44.649
But you're never exactly where
you're supposed to be, are ya?

47:44.651 --> 47:46.784
I mean, 'cause if you are,
you're dead.

47:49.790 --> 47:52.658
And a little 10-year-old you.
He's...

47:52.660 --> 47:55.228
You know, he might have hopes
and dreams, but...

47:57.129 --> 47:58.965
he doesn't understand time...

47:59.899 --> 48:01.401
or the world like you do.

48:03.002 --> 48:04.270
So...

48:06.705 --> 48:09.174
Think you gotta
keep on keeping on.

48:09.176 --> 48:12.909
Just living your life.
Trying new things.

48:12.911 --> 48:16.549
Just gotta...
keep on pushing.

48:35.435 --> 48:36.837
Uh, ma'am, excuse me.

48:37.571 --> 48:39.670
I would like to speak
to the manager.

48:39.672 --> 48:42.008
Yes, that's me.
What can I do for you?

48:43.176 --> 48:46.877
Okay, so you want
to take over the mortgage?

48:46.879 --> 48:49.950
I do. I'd like to pay
for it all upfront.

48:50.718 --> 48:52.417
Well, that can
certainly be done,

48:52.419 --> 48:55.053
but she would need to come in
and sign over the...

48:55.055 --> 48:56.855
Well, I'd like it
to be a surprise.

48:56.857 --> 48:58.190
Oh, I see.

48:58.192 --> 48:59.824
See, I give you the money...

48:59.826 --> 49:02.395
and then she didn't necessarily
have to know about it.

49:03.196 --> 49:05.096
Well, that's a heck
of a Christmas present.

49:06.232 --> 49:07.399
So, you have a few options.

49:07.401 --> 49:10.667
One is you could make
a gift to her.

49:10.669 --> 49:12.703
The other is
she could come in

49:12.705 --> 49:14.138
and sign the property
over to you.

49:14.140 --> 49:16.074
No, no, no.
I don't want to do that.

49:16.076 --> 49:17.641
I just want to pay
for it all

49:17.643 --> 49:19.877
and not have her
necessarily know about it.

49:19.879 --> 49:22.048
Well, she'll know
one way or another.

49:24.216 --> 49:26.319
But what if I had
the money here?

49:27.254 --> 49:28.786
- Right now?
- Yes.

49:28.788 --> 49:31.725
- You have it?
- No, but what if I did?

49:32.625 --> 49:34.125
She'd still need to come in

49:34.127 --> 49:35.592
and sign off
on some paperwork.

49:35.594 --> 49:36.560
I see.

49:36.562 --> 49:37.929
I-It would be very easy.

49:37.931 --> 49:39.230
Just a quick bit of paperwork.

49:39.232 --> 49:41.065
Yeah. Just not
right now though.

49:41.067 --> 49:42.866
No.

49:42.868 --> 49:46.806
Okay, well... thank you.

50:30.750 --> 50:31.919
Thank you.

50:37.658 --> 50:39.223
<i>Is it all right
if I call you Dorothy?</i>

50:39.225 --> 50:40.757
<i>Dot.
You can call me Dot.</i>

50:40.759 --> 50:42.659
<i>All right. I'm going
to record this conversation</i>

50:42.661 --> 50:45.399
<i>- if that's all right with you.
- Okay.</i>

50:46.332 --> 50:48.434
So...

50:49.770 --> 50:51.905
why don't you just tell me
what you remember?

50:53.239 --> 50:55.142
Okay. Um...

50:56.243 --> 50:58.076
Well...

50:58.078 --> 50:59.310
Wait, I'm sorry.
Hang on a second.

50:59.312 --> 51:00.645
It's okay.

51:00.647 --> 51:03.016
I don't usually do the...

51:04.283 --> 51:05.718
You made it worse.

51:10.455 --> 51:12.725
- There we go. All right. Yup.
- It's okay?

51:13.660 --> 51:15.696
Sorry about that. So, uh...

51:16.529 --> 51:18.763
- Should I start again?
- Yeah.

51:18.765 --> 51:23.234
Okay. Um... Gosh.

51:23.236 --> 51:26.904
Well, he and my mom
were only together

51:26.906 --> 51:30.208
for two years, so...

51:30.210 --> 51:33.781
I never met him
that I can recall.

51:35.314 --> 51:37.949
By the time I was born,
he was...

51:37.951 --> 51:39.186
already in prison.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.687
My brother says that he...
he thinks

51:42.689 --> 51:44.355
he can remember him
a little bit,

51:44.357 --> 51:48.025
but I don't know
if he really does...

51:48.027 --> 51:50.763
or if he just thinks
he does 'cause...

51:51.564 --> 51:53.931
You know how it is.
You hear a story and...

51:53.933 --> 51:56.366
you see a picture
and you kind of put

51:56.368 --> 51:57.904
two and two together.

51:58.872 --> 52:01.007
And we heard
all kinds of stories.

52:01.808 --> 52:04.574
She told us all kinds
of stories about him.

52:04.576 --> 52:08.045
And they didn't really
add up,

52:08.047 --> 52:10.882
but we were just kids, so...

52:10.884 --> 52:15.622
He was off sailing
the high seas one year and...

52:16.756 --> 52:18.556
- I think he was off to war...
- Big stories.

52:18.558 --> 52:20.824
- Yeah. Exactly.
- All right. Okay.

52:20.826 --> 52:23.094
Didn't really make
any difference.

52:23.096 --> 52:24.832
He was just dad and...

52:25.564 --> 52:28.200
he was doing stuff and...

52:29.035 --> 52:32.172
someday he was gonna
come back and see us.

52:33.806 --> 52:35.573
And then, um...

52:35.575 --> 52:38.942
...I think I was 15 and, uh...

52:38.944 --> 52:41.712
I guess he was
gonna be paroled, so...

52:41.714 --> 52:45.886
my mom, she sat us down
and told us the truth.

52:47.018 --> 52:50.656
Just in case he came
looking for us, but...

52:52.024 --> 52:53.958
Well, he never did, so...

52:53.960 --> 52:56.393
And so he never called you?
He never wrote?

52:56.395 --> 52:58.228
- Oh, no.
- Mm-hmm.

52:58.230 --> 53:00.066
No. No, he didn't. Uh...

53:00.801 --> 53:03.701
I guess for all I know,
he doesn't know I exist.

53:08.908 --> 53:10.475
And he's a grandpa.

53:10.477 --> 53:12.710
Yeah, I guess he is.

53:12.712 --> 53:14.982
- What's his name?
- Oh, that's Robbie.

53:15.982 --> 53:17.848
Robbie, sweetheart,
you want to say hi?

53:17.850 --> 53:19.085
- No.
- No?

53:19.919 --> 53:22.022
- Sorry.
- No, that's all right.

53:24.457 --> 53:26.223
I got a boy
just about his age.

53:29.529 --> 53:31.698
So, you think
you're gonna catch him?

53:32.632 --> 53:33.931
Well, I hope so.

53:33.933 --> 53:35.768
Well, if you do,
I don't wanna see him.

53:36.701 --> 53:37.835
I don't wanna have to come in

53:37.837 --> 53:39.636
and pick him out of...
what's it...

53:39.638 --> 53:42.239
a lineup
or whatever it's called, okay.

53:42.241 --> 53:43.977
No, that won't be necessary.

53:44.944 --> 53:46.947
You know, I think
he should be locked up.

53:48.915 --> 53:50.750
You know,
my momma told me that...

53:51.651 --> 53:53.217
he always said...

53:53.219 --> 53:55.988
"Oh, I'm a changed man now."

53:57.223 --> 53:58.422
And then he would just get out

53:58.424 --> 54:00.627
and he'd just do it
all over again.

54:01.460 --> 54:03.296
And again and again.

54:05.730 --> 54:07.130
Even after all that, you know,

54:07.132 --> 54:09.770
she loved him
till the day she died.

54:24.317 --> 54:25.585
How about this guy?

54:26.386 --> 54:27.752
That's beautiful.

54:27.754 --> 54:29.520
Oh, it's too much money.

54:29.522 --> 54:31.321
What about something...

54:31.323 --> 54:32.589
How about this one?

54:32.591 --> 54:34.025
I love this piece.

54:37.330 --> 54:39.210
- Would you like to try it on?
- I would.

54:44.036 --> 54:45.272
Oh.

54:47.473 --> 54:49.742
Oh. Take your time.

54:50.609 --> 54:52.078
What do you think?

54:55.614 --> 54:57.250
Let's see it
in the light here.

55:49.935 --> 55:54.638
Oh, I am so embarrassed!
I just walked right off.

55:54.640 --> 55:57.176
I felt so... I'm so sorry!

55:57.944 --> 55:59.375
Would you like me
to help you take it off?

55:59.377 --> 56:01.080
No. Um...

56:02.248 --> 56:03.350
I'll take it.

56:04.984 --> 56:08.989
- How much?
- $249.99 with tax.

56:19.832 --> 56:22.533
Yeah, I held on
to all of this stuff.

56:22.535 --> 56:24.768
Back when I represented him...

56:24.770 --> 56:28.138
I thought maybe I'd write
a book or something like that

56:28.140 --> 56:30.341
or maybe even just tell
my grandkids about it.

56:30.343 --> 56:31.777
It's such a great story.

56:39.051 --> 56:40.786
Is that the man
you're looking for?

56:41.520 --> 56:43.654
Yeah, I do believe it is.

56:43.656 --> 56:44.855
Man, I remember
Forrest Tucker.

56:44.857 --> 56:46.359
He was the real deal.

56:48.160 --> 56:49.462
Holy smokes.

56:50.797 --> 56:52.895
Age 13, bicycle theft.

56:52.897 --> 56:54.300
That's getting an early start.

56:55.067 --> 56:56.902
He spent
his whole life locked up.

56:57.736 --> 57:00.337
Except for the times
that he broke out.

57:00.339 --> 57:03.473
Sixteen successful escapes.

57:03.475 --> 57:04.808
- Sixteen?
- Uh-huh.

57:04.810 --> 57:06.643
That's some kind
of record, right?

57:06.645 --> 57:12.118
A few years back, he broke out
of San Quentin in a boat...

57:12.986 --> 57:15.286
he built out
of scrap wood and tarp

57:15.288 --> 57:17.154
and who knows what else.

57:17.156 --> 57:19.623
Painted the Marin County logo
on the side

57:19.625 --> 57:21.460
and sailed
right on out of there.

57:22.728 --> 57:25.096
You ever meet him,
he'll tell you all about it.

57:25.098 --> 57:28.299
He'll tell you every detail
of every adventure he ever had.

57:28.301 --> 57:29.933
And probably a few
that he didn't.

57:29.935 --> 57:31.034
Maybe somebody
should have told him

57:31.036 --> 57:32.506
to quit while he was ahead.

57:33.239 --> 57:35.408
Well, you find something
you love.

57:36.276 --> 57:39.143
<i>I got put on his case when
he got caught in Montana</i>

57:39.145 --> 57:41.679
<i>a few years back.</i>

57:41.681 --> 57:43.346
There was a chase...

57:43.348 --> 57:47.153
which I learned
was not unusual at all.

57:48.154 --> 57:49.819
Well, when they got
to the showdown,

57:49.821 --> 57:52.457
the cops said
that he fired on them.

57:53.459 --> 57:56.761
But he claimed that, uh,
he didn't even have a gun.

57:56.763 --> 57:59.163
That it was just
his car backfiring.

57:59.165 --> 58:01.301
I expect
that's probably half true.

58:02.602 --> 58:04.067
He did always have
a gun on him,

58:04.069 --> 58:06.971
but if you told me that
he had never fired that thing

58:06.973 --> 58:09.075
once in his life,
I'd believe ya.

58:09.942 --> 58:12.109
I remember
I sat down with him once

58:12.111 --> 58:13.513
and I said, "Forrest...

58:15.448 --> 58:18.016
"surely there's an easier way

58:18.018 --> 58:20.884
for somebody in your position
to make a living."

58:20.886 --> 58:23.254
And he looked at me
and he said, "Brother...

58:23.256 --> 58:25.926
"I'm not talking about
making a living.

58:26.792 --> 58:28.929
I'm just talking
about living."

59:11.437 --> 59:13.939
<i>Keep your
hands where I can see 'em!</i>

59:15.841 --> 59:17.643
<i>Better not be crossed.</i>

01:01:04.049 --> 01:01:05.317
Hi, baby.

01:01:06.319 --> 01:01:07.319
Hi.

01:01:08.853 --> 01:01:10.721
Did you find him?

01:01:10.723 --> 01:01:12.325
Yeah, sorta.

01:01:13.426 --> 01:01:14.627
What's that mean?

01:01:16.562 --> 01:01:17.764
Well...

01:01:18.763 --> 01:01:21.230
I figured out who he is.

01:01:21.232 --> 01:01:22.267
And?

01:01:25.872 --> 01:01:28.672
He's a guy who is old...

01:01:28.674 --> 01:01:30.142
but used to be young.

01:01:32.044 --> 01:01:35.347
And he just loves
robbing banks.

01:01:37.649 --> 01:01:39.285
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:44.254
Just like you're a guy
who's a cop...

01:01:44.256 --> 01:01:45.724
who's gonna catch him.

01:01:53.598 --> 01:01:56.502
Yeah. Something like that.

01:02:01.439 --> 01:02:03.841
It's late.

01:02:04.676 --> 01:02:07.379
- It's not that late, baby.
- The kids are asleep.

01:02:09.547 --> 01:02:11.051
How asleep are they?

01:02:11.783 --> 01:02:14.752
Oh, my goodness.

01:02:14.754 --> 01:02:16.821
- Come on. Let's go out.
- What?

01:02:16.823 --> 01:02:18.288
Let's go out.
Let's get a babysitter.

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:20.089
I have to work in the morning.

01:02:20.091 --> 01:02:21.760
- So what?
- What?

01:02:25.064 --> 01:02:27.297
- What is going on with you?
- I don't know.

01:02:30.368 --> 01:02:32.937
Wait, shouldn't you be
calling somebody?

01:02:32.939 --> 01:02:34.837
But shouldn't... No.
Telling who?

01:02:34.839 --> 01:02:36.105
That you found him?

01:02:36.107 --> 01:02:38.375
Tell who? Tell them?
I'm not telling anybody.

01:02:39.978 --> 01:02:41.647
Tonight he's all mine.

01:03:26.459 --> 01:03:27.493
Hey.

01:03:28.426 --> 01:03:29.560
Yeah.

01:03:29.562 --> 01:03:32.462
You really just
drifted off into outer space.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.900
Yeah. Hey, you wanna
get out of here?

01:03:36.902 --> 01:03:38.234
Oh, we just ordered pie.

01:03:38.236 --> 01:03:39.335
No, I mean
really get out of here.

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:40.739
Like take a trip somewhere.

01:03:42.174 --> 01:03:44.677
- Like a vacation?
- Yeah.

01:03:45.844 --> 01:03:48.411
Oh. I don't know, I...

01:03:48.413 --> 01:03:50.681
You know, I've got the animals
to take care of and...

01:03:50.683 --> 01:03:53.219
Yeah, but say that wasn't
a problem. Would you want to?

01:03:55.453 --> 01:03:56.620
Maybe.

01:03:56.622 --> 01:03:57.623
Okay.

01:04:22.281 --> 01:04:23.682
Hey!

01:04:25.817 --> 01:04:27.586
Didn't I see you on TV?

01:04:34.893 --> 01:04:36.326
- Oh, maybe.
- No, I think so.

01:04:36.328 --> 01:04:37.426
You were involved in that...
What were you call...

01:04:37.428 --> 01:04:38.931
The Over The Hill Gang, right?

01:04:40.065 --> 01:04:41.165
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:04:41.167 --> 01:04:42.435
Did you catch them?

01:04:45.703 --> 01:04:46.837
Not yet.

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:48.875
Hmm. You close?

01:04:49.908 --> 01:04:51.210
Oh, we're getting there.

01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:54.911
Excuse me. I don't want
to be rude here, but...

01:04:54.913 --> 01:04:56.513
straighten this out
a little bit.

01:04:56.515 --> 01:04:59.350
I was forced to learn how
to do this in Catholic school.

01:04:59.352 --> 01:05:01.054
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:05:01.955 --> 01:05:04.824
There you go. Looking sharp.
You got a gal with you?

01:05:05.924 --> 01:05:07.524
I got my wife with me, yeah.

01:05:07.526 --> 01:05:09.326
Oh, this is great.

01:05:09.328 --> 01:05:11.060
It's been my experience
that looking sharp

01:05:11.062 --> 01:05:12.328
will take you a long,
long way.

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.130
Make you look like you know
what you're doing.

01:05:14.933 --> 01:05:16.236
Even if you don't.

01:05:20.772 --> 01:05:21.841
Forrest?

01:05:26.245 --> 01:05:27.680
I know what I'm doing.

01:07:09.281 --> 01:07:10.516
Goodnight.

01:09:56.782 --> 01:09:58.615
<i>Forrest Tucker,
you are under arrest.</i>

01:09:58.617 --> 01:10:00.249
<i>Step away from the car!</i>

01:10:00.251 --> 01:10:03.154
<i>Put your hands up and
step away from the car now!</i>

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:08.092
<i>Don't do it!
Get out of the car!</i>

01:10:57.975 --> 01:11:00.209
<i>Two cars south bound on...</i>

01:11:00.211 --> 01:11:02.848
<i>FS-522 going south bound...</i>

01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:34.613
Please.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:38.184
Please. My boy.

01:11:49.694 --> 01:11:50.694
Okay.

01:11:50.696 --> 01:11:51.928
Pull over here.

01:13:55.953 --> 01:13:57.288
Is he okay?

01:13:59.157 --> 01:14:00.192
Mm-hmm.

01:14:01.493 --> 01:14:02.928
I understand.

01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:07.466
Okay, well.
Hey, thanks for calling.

01:14:10.102 --> 01:14:11.634
All right.

01:14:22.447 --> 01:14:24.948
What happened?

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:26.285
Well, they caught him.

01:14:27.786 --> 01:14:29.421
- They did?
- Yeah.

01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:32.892
- Yup.
- How?

01:14:34.292 --> 01:14:37.897
Oh, somebody talked.

01:14:39.364 --> 01:14:40.866
Hmm.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.135
Now what?

01:14:45.604 --> 01:14:47.006
He'll go to prison.

01:14:47.872 --> 01:14:49.140
Hmm.

01:14:50.408 --> 01:14:51.876
That's too bad.

01:14:53.577 --> 01:14:55.046
Yeah, I guess so.

01:14:59.518 --> 01:15:01.554
I'm sorry
you didn't catch him.

01:15:07.692 --> 01:15:09.060
I'm not.

01:15:25.609 --> 01:15:28.779
<i>The Over
the Hill Gang is no more.</i>

01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:31.147
<i>Last night,
federal agents in Fort Worth</i>

01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:33.016
<i>arrested the leader
of the group,</i>

01:15:33.018 --> 01:15:36.552
<i>74-year-old
Forrest Silver Tucker.</i>

01:15:36.554 --> 01:15:38.286
<i>Tucker, a native of Florida,</i>

01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:41.022
<i>is best remembered in the
Bay area for engineering...</i>

01:15:41.024 --> 01:15:42.491
<i>...one of the most</i>

01:15:42.493 --> 01:15:44.793
<i>innovative prison breaks
in San Quentin history.</i>

01:15:44.795 --> 01:15:47.097
<i>That is just one
of a long list of escapes</i>

01:15:47.099 --> 01:15:49.833
<i>and an even longer list
of crimes.</i>

01:16:11.688 --> 01:16:14.091
<i>But after
a few years on the lam,</i>

01:16:14.093 --> 01:16:16.959
<i>time has officially caught up
with this career criminal.</i>

01:16:16.961 --> 01:16:20.195
<i>Also arrested,
fellow convict Teddy Green</i>

01:16:20.197 --> 01:16:22.266
<i>whom Tucker met
in San Quentin.</i>

01:16:22.268 --> 01:16:25.035
<i>A third member of the gang
is still at large,</i>

01:16:25.037 --> 01:16:27.271
<i>but for the time being,
police say</i>

01:16:27.273 --> 01:16:30.576
<i>The Over the Hill Gang
is officially retired.</i>

01:17:02.072 --> 01:17:04.209
Forrest Tucker,
you got a visitor.

01:17:12.983 --> 01:17:15.254
You lied to me
about your name.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.589
Well, I figured you knew.

01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:23.261
That's what the detectives
asked me, if I knew.

01:17:24.862 --> 01:17:29.400
If I even had
the slightest idea.

01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:33.471
- Hmm, what'd you say?
- Said of course not.

01:17:36.675 --> 01:17:38.607
I'm sorry.

01:17:38.609 --> 01:17:40.679
Well, me too.

01:17:47.051 --> 01:17:49.188
Here. I wrote something
for you.

01:17:57.696 --> 01:17:59.061
What's this?

01:17:59.063 --> 01:18:01.499
These are all the times
I broke out before.

01:19:46.304 --> 01:19:47.469
You coming, Forrest?

01:19:47.471 --> 01:19:48.905
Oh, I'm gonna finish up here.

01:19:48.907 --> 01:19:50.309
I'll be with you in a minute.

01:19:51.608 --> 01:19:52.743
Okay.

01:20:45.796 --> 01:20:46.831
What about this one?

01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:48.934
Well...

01:20:50.167 --> 01:20:52.336
kinda saving
the best for last.

01:20:55.206 --> 01:20:56.440
Well...

01:20:57.774 --> 01:20:58.844
maybe, uh...

01:21:00.077 --> 01:21:02.247
maybe you should
just stay put.

01:22:21.959 --> 01:22:24.962
Mudroom's right across
the hall if you need anything.

01:22:26.797 --> 01:22:27.933
Okay.

01:22:30.469 --> 01:22:32.837
You can stay
as long as you want to.

01:22:35.206 --> 01:22:36.440
Thanks.

01:22:40.444 --> 01:22:42.046
I'm glad you called.

01:22:45.416 --> 01:22:47.019
Well, I'm glad you picked up.

01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:17.549
<i>Then we'll go on.</i>

01:23:19.216 --> 01:23:20.551
<i>Doesn't matter where.</i>

01:23:21.452 --> 01:23:23.322
<i>Maybe we'll run over
to Arizona.</i>

01:23:24.255 --> 01:23:25.589
<i>The roads are straight.</i>

01:23:26.523 --> 01:23:27.892
<i>And we'll build a house.</i>

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:30.962
<i>Yeah, we'll build a house.</i>

01:23:32.529 --> 01:23:34.899
<i>Because if I'm not grounded
pretty soon...</i>

01:23:36.099 --> 01:23:37.669
<i>I'm going to go into orbit.</i>

01:24:36.059 --> 01:24:37.428
Jewel, wake up.

01:24:39.697 --> 01:24:41.797
I need to go out for a bit.
Do you need anything?

01:24:41.799 --> 01:24:46.438
No. How long
you gonna be gone?

01:24:47.304 --> 01:24:48.640
Not long.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.068
Hello?

01:25:18.803 --> 01:25:19.735
Hello?

01:25:19.737 --> 01:25:20.939
<i>Hey, John.</i>

01:25:22.172 --> 01:25:23.675
Yeah, it is.

01:25:26.376 --> 01:25:28.513
- Who's this?
<i>- How's it going?</i>

01:25:30.514 --> 01:25:31.816
Forrest Tucker.

01:25:33.251 --> 01:25:34.883
Is that you?

01:25:34.885 --> 01:25:38.154
- <i>I heard you got out.</i>
- Yeah, I got out all right.

01:25:38.156 --> 01:25:41.490
What happened? Did you
get tired of digging tunnels

01:25:41.492 --> 01:25:43.194
and climbing fences?

01:25:44.394 --> 01:25:46.764
<i>Well, I thought so, but, uh...</i>

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.868
<i>Forrest?</i>

01:25:52.336 --> 01:25:54.337
<i>Forrest, are you all right?</i>

01:25:54.339 --> 01:25:56.675
Yeah, I... I'm about to be.
