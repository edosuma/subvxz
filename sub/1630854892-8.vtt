00:06.006 --> 00:08.384
My name is Regus Patoff,

00:08.384 --> 00:11.679
and I've traveled a very long
way to offer you a gift.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.807
Describe him for me.
How much does he weigh?

00:14.807 --> 00:17.309
You know, you're not at all
like he described you.

00:17.309 --> 00:20.479
If it helps him to see me
as a monster, so be it.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.356
Mother Sang had other
arrangements.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.567
- Where is she staying?
- She didn't say.

00:24.567 --> 00:27.319
Inform marketing that we're
ready to launch.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.572
Why don't we break an elephant
out of the zoo?

00:29.572 --> 00:31.282
I like Elaine's the most.

00:31.282 --> 00:33.409
I may have a job offer for you.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.870
- He wants 30,000.
- The budget is 20.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.663
I guess you don't got yourself
an elephant.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.248
You're not walking away
from this, Patrice.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.168
- When does it have to be done?
- Patti!

00:42.168 --> 00:45.171
I went to Pomona but it's not
what it seems like.

00:45.171 --> 00:47.882
And I shouldn't have lied to
you, I'm really sorry.

Chaos on the
streets of downtown Los Angeles

02:44.832 --> 02:46.208
earlier this morning.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.336
A wild elephant brought
4th Street to a standstill.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.630
We've learned the 35-year-old
female elephant,

02:51.630 --> 02:54.049
named Jumbo, was stolen
late last night

02:54.049 --> 02:56.093
from a traveling circus
in Barstow.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.679
She was later abandoned in
the arts district.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.515
Police and animal control moved
in to subdue the elephant

03:01.515 --> 03:03.726
and remove her before
rush hour began.

03:03.726 --> 03:06.729
Sadly, officials now tell us
that Jumbo died

03:06.729 --> 03:09.189
- while being transported.
- Thanks for watching.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.942
We have a lot more news...

03:32.504 --> 03:34.423
Open the door!

03:40.429 --> 03:43.265
Well, the big fucking
grey lump died.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.852
It was unforeseen
circumstances.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.021
Elaine, they're gonna send
me down for murder.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.482
It's not murder! People
kill elephants all the time

03:51.482 --> 03:54.151
- and post images online.
- You know what? Fuck this.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.862
I'm going to San Pedro
until the heat dies down.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.530
Where is my 10Gs?

04:51.959 --> 04:53.961
Yes?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.758

07:36.331 --> 07:40.043
Hey, I just formally met
Patrice, what a special guy.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.422
He won't leave until
he gets paid.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.382
Yeah, where is
the throat fucker?

07:45.382 --> 07:48.093
He hasn't been in all day
and he's not answering

07:48.093 --> 07:49.928
any of my calls.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.389
Ah, I wrote down a message
for him earlier.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.766
Where did I put it again?

07:54.766 --> 07:56.059
Oh yeah.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.984
We're closing in on a million
users in our first day.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.485
You created a hit game.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.696
You really wanna walk away
from that?

08:07.696 --> 08:09.114
What are you doing?

08:09.114 --> 08:12.743
Are you working during an office
party?

08:12.743 --> 08:15.329
I'm updating my resume.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.623
There's a job coming up
at Koala.

08:17.623 --> 08:20.083
Executive vice president
of development.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.377
Hmm. Don't forget to mention
your experience

08:22.377 --> 08:24.338

wildlife.

I'll see if I can get

08:30.427 --> 08:33.055
No one's gonna hire me again.

08:33.055 --> 08:35.098
You're a talented coder, Craig.

08:35.098 --> 08:38.185
You just gotta start

08:38.185 --> 08:41.730
Hmm. Do you remember the
stalkerware I put on the demo?

08:41.730 --> 08:44.107
- To get Patoff's contacts?
- Yeah.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.276
It never got taken out
of the code.

08:46.276 --> 08:49.571
Our servers now hold data on
almost a million devices.

08:49.571 --> 08:52.950

09:27.192 --> 09:30.112
I had an appointment.

09:30.112 --> 09:33.448
My friend that we hired
to do that little job,

09:33.448 --> 09:35.117
he's here.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.035
He wants the $10,000.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.914
It's spent.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.501
Spent?

09:44.501 --> 09:48.422
The party.
It was a petty cash item.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.883
$700 on jumbo shrimp alone.
Did you try it yet?

09:54.219 --> 09:56.179
Patrice is here to collect.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.516
Well, if I'm to believe
the news,

09:59.516 --> 10:02.185
the elephant died,
did it not?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.229
That's not our fault.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.189
They shot her full of
tranquillizers,

10:06.189 --> 10:09.192
- and her heart gave out.
- Well, nevertheless...

10:13.322 --> 10:16.742
Our contract with Mr. Patrice
is null and void.

10:18.535 --> 10:23.206
Mr. Patoff, I know Patrice,
and he has a very short fuse.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.876
This is definitely going
to light it.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.545
He will become violent?

10:28.545 --> 10:30.047
I can't rule it out.

10:31.673 --> 10:35.844
We have less than a minute
to strategize.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.721
What is the solution?

10:37.721 --> 10:39.264
Uh, I don't know.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.475
Well, he's frightened
and desperate.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.478
- He may accept half.
- We do not have half.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.576
If we cannot pay him
and his temper is volatile,

10:59.576 --> 11:01.370
what option do we have?

11:12.381 --> 11:16.927
We could offer him $15,000
if he waits until morning.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.721
Patrice is greedy enough
to accept.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.808
- It should buy us some time.
- With which to do what?

11:24.643 --> 11:27.479
To give the police a person
of interest,

11:27.479 --> 11:29.773
an anonymous tip.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.901
He's on parole. Then one slip-up
and he's back inside.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.153
Where he cannot collect.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.865
He's tagged. It shouldn't take
them long to find him.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.701
Are we legally implicated
by your actions?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.248
It's his reputation
against ours.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.792
The worst that could
happen to us is...

11:48.792 --> 11:50.627
...more publicity.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.382
These are not comfortable
decisions, Elaine.

11:59.636 --> 12:04.141
Sacrifices are hard...
but effective.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.993
The hunter who felled the beast.

12:22.993 --> 12:27.539
It is a pleasure to be in
business with you, Mr. Patrice.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.834
- Where's my money?
- So direct and to the point.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.546
I like that about you.
But indulge me for one moment.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.965
I am yet to watch
an elephant die.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.676
Do they scream when they go?

12:41.094 --> 12:44.014
I opened the cage
and I got outta there.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.516
When I left, it was still alive.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.101
Casualty of war.

12:53.190 --> 12:56.902
- You ever gonna let go?
- Oh! In business,

12:56.902 --> 13:00.155
a handshake is where
you evaluate your opponent.

13:00.155 --> 13:04.159

13:08.955 --> 13:10.749

Patti?

22:18.337 --> 22:19.881

What about you, Mr. Patoff?

23:55.226 --> 23:58.521
Our friend, the jeweler,
has a fanciful imagination.

23:58.521 --> 24:01.399
He's inhaled too many fumes.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.776

24:05.194 --> 24:07.405

24:07.405 --> 24:10.825
Some people excel under stress.
Some break.

Craig, do we not?

24:13.953 --> 24:18.124
Ah!

24:21.836 --> 24:25.131
Look at me.
You don't work for him.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.384
None of us do.
He's just the consultant.

24:31.762 --> 24:33.264
Where's Craig?

24:34.557 --> 24:37.310
He's here.
He came to rescue you.

24:59.081 --> 25:00.666
Who the fuck are you?

25:02.001 --> 25:06.130
Consultant.
Definition: one who consults.

25:06.130 --> 25:09.926
Providing professional or expert
advice in a particular field

25:09.926 --> 25:13.346

an organization or individual.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.306
Ah!

25:18.935 --> 25:21.103
You don't even know what we do.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.855
It's of no consequence.

25:22.855 --> 25:27.902
My job is to observe,
to streamline, to improve.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.946
My targets were met.

25:29.946 --> 25:32.657
Costs justified.

25:32.657 --> 25:33.991
Costs?

25:38.246 --> 25:41.666
This is the real world, Craig.

25:41.666 --> 25:44.961
People get hurt.
People panic.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.129
People fail.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.317
You're not the hero.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.986
You don't even get the girl.

26:38.222 --> 26:39.640
Oh my God!

28:42.596 --> 28:44.306

- Yes.

28:44.306 --> 28:46.267
We'd like to ask you
some questions

28:46.267 --> 28:48.727
about your relationship
with Patrice Anderson.

28:51.105 --> 28:55.776
Did I pay Patrice $10,000
to steal an elephant?

28:57.778 --> 29:00.948
I'm just the creative liaison.

29:00.948 --> 29:03.701
Recruitment falls under
the jurisdiction of my boss,

29:03.701 --> 29:06.203
Mr. Patoff.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.122
Regus Patoff.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.376
I say "boss."

29:12.376 --> 29:14.462
He's more of a consultant.

29:19.341 --> 29:22.553
He doesn't
have any authority.

29:22.553 --> 29:25.639
He doesn't understand
what we do.

29:28.434 --> 29:31.020
He doesn't take a commission.

29:31.020 --> 29:33.230
He just showed up one day,

29:33.230 --> 29:35.274
and took over.

31:48.365 --> 31:51.201
He elevated us.

31:51.201 --> 31:54.413
He motivated us.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.708
He changed our methods.

31:57.708 --> 32:00.544
He showed us all
what we're capable of.

32:41.627 --> 32:45.047
All I can really tell
you about Regus Patoff...

32:50.469 --> 32:52.304
...he gets results.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.626

33:22.626 --> 33:25.546
The drop comes on the heels
of the apparent suicide

33:25.546 --> 33:28.006

Rebecca Hood.

33:28.006 --> 33:31.468
Hood started Pterodactyl
