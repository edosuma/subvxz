WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.770
<i>Back in the '80s,
high school athletes</i>

00:02.903 --> 00:04.772
<i>were William Penn royalty.</i>

00:04.905 --> 00:07.341
<i>They were celebrated,
they were adored,</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:09.377
<i>and they could do no wrong.</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:11.345
<i>Well, except
in one person's eyes.</i>

00:11.479 --> 00:12.846
Why do we even have
a Senior Night?

00:12.980 --> 00:14.815
To honor the people
like Brea,

00:14.948 --> 00:17.185
who devoted so many hours
to, um...

00:17.318 --> 00:18.619
Volleyball.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.155
Really? That sounds made-up,
but I'll defer to you.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.356
Well, let's get it
over with.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.358
I've got a 12-cheese calzone
in the oven.

00:24.492 --> 00:25.793
That seems like
too many cheeses.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.195
You'd think, but somehow,

00:27.328 --> 00:29.730
more becomes
indecipherably less.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.732
Hey, Brea's mom,
if I give you my keys,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.801
will you run home
and take it out for me?

00:33.934 --> 00:36.570
Yeah, I'm not gonna miss
my daughter's big moment.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.440
Big moment?
She taps a balloon
across a net.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.741
Oh, also

00:41.542 --> 00:42.810
congratulations,
Brea.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.345
Thanks.
Sort of.

00:45.679 --> 00:49.583
And now, let's honor
our senior athletes!

00:49.717 --> 00:52.653
For three years, this gal led
the Lady Quakers in sets

00:52.786 --> 00:55.055
and had more kills
than a Serengeti cheetah.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.424
Brea Bee!

00:56.557 --> 00:57.791
Oh!

00:57.925 --> 00:59.627
Big whoop.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.329
Remember the time
you re-created

01:01.462 --> 01:03.030
Moses leading
his people out of Egypt

01:03.164 --> 01:04.298
with Legos and Kool-Aid?

01:04.432 --> 01:05.766
That was impressive.

01:05.899 --> 01:09.036
I just want to thank my mom
for always supporting me.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.138
I love you with all my heart.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.605
Come out here, Mom.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.009
What am I seeing
right now?

01:16.144 --> 01:18.346
Brian Walls!

01:18.479 --> 01:19.780
This one's for you,
Mama.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.350
What? Another rose
for another mama?

01:22.483 --> 01:24.084
Yeah. All the moms
get thanked
with a rose.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.354
Oh, envious spirit,
I covet thee!

01:26.487 --> 01:28.256
Sorry.
For athletes' moms only.

01:28.389 --> 01:31.058
Brian Corbett!

01:32.660 --> 01:34.195
I'd like to thank
both of my moms.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.431
Hey, uh,
w-where'd the roses go?

01:37.565 --> 01:39.200
Got it. I've got it.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.702
Hello, jocks and sportos.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.372
Um, to use your lingo

01:44.505 --> 01:46.340
we're gonna take a time-out

01:46.474 --> 01:49.310
so that my special player
can honor me.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.745
Adam?
Oh, no.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.282
You came sliding out of me
face-first,

01:54.415 --> 01:55.449
like a baseballer.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.551
Did I die?
Am I dead?

01:57.685 --> 01:59.253
Unfortunately for you, no.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.721
Hey, Adam, why are you just
sitting there?

02:00.854 --> 02:03.157
Bring your taut,
athletic tushie
up here

02:03.291 --> 02:05.559
and give me all
the mother-loving roses.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.796
<i>** I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:08.929 --> 02:12.099
<i>** But nonetheless
I feel the need to say</i>

02:14.568 --> 02:16.136
<i>** I don't know the future</i>

02:16.270 --> 02:19.940
<i>** But the past keeps getting
clearer every day **</i>

02:20.073 --> 02:21.975
<i>It was November 3rd,
1980-something,</i>

02:22.109 --> 02:24.144
<i>and while my sister's
wedding day was a way's off,</i>

02:24.278 --> 02:26.780
<i>the events leading up to it
were in full swing.</i>

02:26.914 --> 02:28.115
<i>At least, for the groom.</i>

02:28.249 --> 02:29.217
Hi, my love.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.584
Can you spare me
Saturday afternoon

02:30.718 --> 02:32.119
from who knows when
to I have no idea?

02:32.253 --> 02:33.654
I'm sure I'll survive
whatever vague

02:33.787 --> 02:35.289
and loosely scheduled thing
you're doing.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.757
It's tux shopping
with the JTP.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.158
I'm gonna look like
Cary Grant

02:38.292 --> 02:39.627
or that guy at the mall
who plays the piano.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.928
What's his story?
How did he end up

02:41.061 --> 02:42.129
in front of
a dead escalator?

02:42.263 --> 02:43.964
I'm okay never knowing.
But look at you.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.666
You're on it
with wedding activities,

02:45.799 --> 02:47.801
tux shopping,
groomsmen softball,

02:47.935 --> 02:49.203
camp friends spa day.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.938
It's actually not me that's
planning all this stuff.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.406
It is I!

02:52.540 --> 02:54.675
Geoffrey's and the world's
best man

02:54.808 --> 02:56.744
and pre-wedding fun captain.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.412
Captain?
It's not
an official rank,

02:58.546 --> 03:00.614
but his body
is fit for service.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.416
We should
really keep that door
locked from now on.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.718
Silence! Just know
that on Saturday,

03:04.852 --> 03:06.320
the man who's
settling for you

03:06.454 --> 03:08.689
will be doing
some high-octane tux shopping,

03:08.822 --> 03:10.558
which may include
a rented penguin

03:10.691 --> 03:12.192
for maximum
photo adorableness.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.361
No way!
Way.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.528
I have many friends
at the zoo.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.629
And enemies.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.130
You know, frankly,
it's touch-and-go.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.199
As much as it pains me to say
anything nice to you,

03:19.333 --> 03:20.534
you're surprisingly
on top of it.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.169
True. For weeks,
he's done nothing

03:22.303 --> 03:23.604
but wedding stuff
and attending to

03:23.737 --> 03:25.038
my intense romantic needs.
Mm-hmm.

03:25.172 --> 03:28.041
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to see about a girl.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.610
A girl penguin.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.345
I know.
Penguins can be girls.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.580
I didn't believe it
either.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.248
Ta!

03:34.382 --> 03:36.183
So, Erica, what's on
your pre-wedding docket?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.618
Well, Lainey's organizing
dress shopping.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.287
Isn't Lainey, like,
lost at sea?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.489
No, she's at sea,
and no one knows where,

03:41.622 --> 03:42.656
and Erica hasn't spoken
to her

03:42.790 --> 03:43.824
in a disconcertingly
long time.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.225
She's just busy singing on
that cruise ship.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.827
Fun fact about cruises,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.696
the longer the cruise,
the more poo

03:48.829 --> 03:50.063
the ship is carrying
back to the port.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.232
I'd say that's more fact
than fun.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.302
But the point is,
Lainey is on top of it.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.437
<i>Or so she thought.</i>

03:56.570 --> 03:58.306
Erica?

03:58.439 --> 03:59.740
I'm sorry.
There's a huge storm
on the way,

03:59.873 --> 04:01.074
so they're coming to
evacuate us.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.376
What's up?

04:02.510 --> 04:03.877
So, she may not be
fully on it.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.413
Here's a kooky idea.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.716
What if I, Joanne,
am your fun captain?

04:08.849 --> 04:10.684
Yes! My sister planning
my fiancee's wedding events.

04:10.818 --> 04:11.785
We solved it.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.186
Did we?

04:13.321 --> 04:15.689
Because as much as I love
Joanne's wild-card energy

04:15.823 --> 04:17.691
I do have a pretty deep bench

04:17.825 --> 04:19.059
of close friends
to pick from.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.630
Well, if you change your mind,
here's my business card.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.398
Tom Wiggins,
Assistant Manager, Kinko's?

04:24.532 --> 04:26.534
Oh, that's right.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.436
I never followed through.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.871
<i>So,
Erica reached out
to her long list of friends,</i>

04:31.004 --> 04:33.073
<i>starting with her old college
pal, Ren.</i>

04:33.206 --> 04:34.642
Hey, Lady!

04:34.775 --> 04:36.109
It's so nice
to hear your voice.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.711
Sorry I've been
so out of touch.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.780
I have been busy planning
a wedding for my friend Jill.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.515
Ugh, it is so much work.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.017
I swear to God,
never again.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.820
So, what's up?
Just saying hey.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.590
<i>So,
she called her next
best choice, Valley Erica.</i>

04:49.723 --> 04:51.859
Erica? Oh, my God.
Like, hey.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.761
Michael,
get down from there!

04:53.894 --> 04:55.629
Glenn, that's not
how you use a mouth.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.065
Dustin,
that's the cat's food!

04:58.198 --> 05:00.300
Word of advice,
do not have triplets.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.570
Triplets? How long has it been
since we spoke?

05:02.703 --> 05:05.072
Not long. Things move quickly
in Scottsdale.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.540
<i>Gotta go.</i>

05:06.674 --> 05:08.376
<i>And then her real
next best choice,</i>

05:08.509 --> 05:09.910
<i>her old high-school friend
Carla.</i>

05:10.043 --> 05:11.645
Hey!
Hey.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.146
I was just wondering
if you might like to plan

05:13.280 --> 05:14.748
some fun wedding stuff
for me.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.250
Ooh, I already have a job
that I'm bad at.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.819
But if you need wings...

05:18.952 --> 05:20.087
I wouldn't get 'em here.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.122
So, I completely
struck out

05:22.255 --> 05:23.724
and have no pre-wedding
fun captain.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.158
You know, my sister's dying
to help.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.327
Yeah, it's just Joanne doesn't
know me very well.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.463
But you know who <i>does</i>
know me well?

05:29.597 --> 05:31.264
Me.
Ooh, is this one
of those logic puzzles,

05:31.399 --> 05:33.266
like where the doctor who
couldn't operate on the boy

05:33.401 --> 05:35.068
turned out to be
his mother?
It's the '80s.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.037
A woman can plan her own
wedding events, can't she?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.939
Not sure that's gonna be
the takeaway from this decade,

05:39.072 --> 05:40.408
but I guess.
Then it's settled.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.009
I will be
my own fun captain.

05:42.142 --> 05:45.112
Yay! My fiancee has a shaky
and unconventional plan.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.114
<i>While Erica had decided
to do it herself,</i>

05:47.247 --> 05:50.150
<i>my mother was still beside
herself about Senior Night.</i>

05:50.283 --> 05:52.486
Do you realize how much better
athletes are treated

05:52.620 --> 05:53.987
at what we were promised

05:54.121 --> 05:56.657
was an exclusive,
elitist private school?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.158
We did have it
pretty good.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.127
What are you talking about?
You're not an athlete,

06:00.260 --> 06:01.929
unless they turned
being a moron
into a sport.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.431
How dare you?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.833
I'm an Olympic-caliber
sportsman

06:05.966 --> 06:07.801
who never got a chance
to prove it

06:07.935 --> 06:10.704
'cause coaches,
teammates, umpires,
and equipment managers

06:10.838 --> 06:12.540
were too intimidated
by my dominance.

06:12.673 --> 06:13.941
We can stop talking now.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.342
Murray, we have to
do something.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.511
Why should the jocks
get special treatment?

06:17.645 --> 06:20.881
Face it, if Barry could hit
a baseball like Mike Schmidt,

06:21.014 --> 06:22.516
wouldn't we
love him more?
No.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.752
I can hit like Schmitty!

06:24.885 --> 06:26.620
Come out back and pitch to me,
old man!

06:26.754 --> 06:28.155
That doesn't
seem like something
that's gonna happen.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.890
Touch my pec.
Go ahead.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.358
Feel its shape
and girthy weight.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.126
I'm not touching
your anything!

06:33.260 --> 06:35.929
Mom! Dad won't recognize
my natural abilities

06:36.063 --> 06:37.531
and physical prowess
by caressing me!

06:37.665 --> 06:39.567
Cup your son's boy-bosom!

06:39.700 --> 06:40.768
Do you hear your words?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.169
Fine. If you're not gonna help

06:42.302 --> 06:43.704
either one of your sons,
then I will.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.740
Very meaty, dear.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.178
In your face.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.585
Earl, are you aware that
the athletes in this school

06:57.718 --> 06:59.553
get treated better
than all the other kids?

06:59.687 --> 07:00.921
I can explain that.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.155
They are better.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.758
Because they're all strong
and coordinated?

07:04.892 --> 07:06.860
Not just that.
There's also a swagger.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.428
Well, this changes now.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.565
I demand that all the kids who
are not as gifted athletically

07:11.699 --> 07:13.200
be treated the same
as the jocks.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.768
But then how will they learn
that they're not as good?

07:14.902 --> 07:17.104
They are as good, Earl.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.239
And they deserve
the rose-kissy thing, too.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.574
The what-zit now?

07:20.708 --> 07:22.209
When all the athletes fawn
all over their mothers

07:22.342 --> 07:24.678
in front of the whole school?
I want that for me.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.880
I mean, you know,
for all the other kids.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.916
But no one cares about
their ho-hum achievements.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.918
Then I'm just gonna have
to invoke Title Nine.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.487
What, the law that prevents
sex discrimination in schools?

07:33.621 --> 07:35.523
Then Title Eight. Or Ten.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.090
Darn my weakness
for vague threats.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.126
What will make this all
go away?

07:39.259 --> 07:42.896
I want the non-athletes to be
celebrated and adored, too.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.898
Feign interest in non-jocks.
Got it.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.500
And the rose-kissy thing.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.035
Yeah, you've mentioned that
twice now.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.904
Okay, you win.
The athlete-worshipping
culture

07:51.038 --> 07:53.607
of this place ends,
starting now.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.543
Yo, Ball-Man,
can I borrow your ride?

07:55.676 --> 07:57.511
Chem lab's boring
and I want to go get
an ice cream cake.

07:57.645 --> 07:58.779
Sure thing, dawg.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.247
And, uh,
when you're done with it,

08:00.380 --> 08:01.915
just park it
wherever you want.
I'll find it.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.019
Okay, starting now.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.822
<i>While my mom was pursuing
her rose celebration,</i>

08:08.956 --> 08:12.092
<i>Erica's wedding run-up was
feeling less than celebratory.</i>

08:12.225 --> 08:14.628
Hi. Erica Goldberg.
I'm here to try on dresses.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.996
Perfect.
Just let me know

08:16.129 --> 08:17.430
when the rest
of your party
gets here.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.633
Actually, it's
just gonna be me today.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.501
No maid of honor?
Again, just me.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.670
Sisters?
Just me.

08:22.803 --> 08:23.804
Cousins?
Nope.

08:23.937 --> 08:24.905
Work friends?
Flying solo.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.006
College friends?
Going it alone.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.107
New friends?
Party of one.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.208
Well, what about
your mother?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.342
Oh, God, no.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.644
She's the best,
but also the worst.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.145
So I'm doing this round,

08:32.279 --> 08:33.146
and then she promised to come
and be awful

08:33.280 --> 08:34.481
when I settle on something.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.683
Would you mind
if we grabbed

08:35.816 --> 08:36.950
some of
these champagne glasses?

08:37.084 --> 08:38.051
Another client brought
way more guests

08:38.185 --> 08:39.252
than we anticipated.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.955
Take 'em all, Beth.
Mine's here all by herself.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.423
Has that ever happened
before?

08:43.557 --> 08:45.292
Not that I can remember, and
I've been here for 15 years.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.227
There's a person here
with ears and everything.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.528
So, is that a yes?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.097
Just take
the friggin' glasses, Beth.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.865
<i>And so
began the loneliest</i>

08:51.999 --> 08:54.067
<i>wedding-dress-trying-on
in history.</i>

08:54.201 --> 08:57.137
<i>There was this fun number,
and a more modest option.</i>

08:57.270 --> 08:59.306
<i>She was a princess
without a court,</i>

08:59.439 --> 09:01.541
<i>a Southern belle whose friends
had gone with the wind,</i>

09:01.675 --> 09:03.611
<i>and whatever this is.</i>

09:03.744 --> 09:05.713
Why do I keep coming out?
There's a mirror in here.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.581
<i>But without any friends
to weigh in,</i>

09:07.715 --> 09:09.683
<i>my sister was feeling stuck,
literally.</i>

09:09.817 --> 09:10.851
Hello? Beth?

09:10.984 --> 09:11.952
Other lady?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.186
Little help?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.487
Oh. Thank God.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.889
I thought you guys
forgot about me.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.691
Sorry, Tiffany!
I found one more!

09:19.492 --> 09:20.728
I hate you, Tiffany!

09:20.861 --> 09:22.529
I've exhausted
all my options,

09:22.663 --> 09:24.898
so you're my fun captain.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.734
Ah! You handpicked me!

09:26.867 --> 09:28.969
<i>As Erica welcomed Joanne
to the team,</i>

09:29.102 --> 09:30.537
<i>the kids
who'd never played on one</i>

09:30.671 --> 09:33.707
<i>were starting to enjoy the
privileges of those who did.</i>

09:33.841 --> 09:35.342
<i>** Dave Kim, he's our man</i>

09:35.475 --> 09:37.144
<i>** If he can't do it,
no one can **</i>

09:37.277 --> 09:39.412
What exactly can no one do
that I maybe can?

09:39.546 --> 09:41.448
Win the Science Fair by
simulating a wind turbine.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.883
Way to go, Davy.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.386
I don't know
what's happening,

09:46.519 --> 09:48.622
but this is farther
than I've gotten in my dreams.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.590
"Congrats Matt Schernecke
on his sly turn

09:50.724 --> 09:52.159
"as Rooster Hannigan
in 'Annie'"?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.094
That performance
was wildly uneven.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.029
Agreed. The choreography
on "Easy Street"

09:56.163 --> 09:57.197
swallowed him whole.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.566
But the bigger question is,
what gives?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.168
<i>Good day, students.</i>

10:01.301 --> 10:03.136
First off, I'd like to give
a verbal high-five

10:03.270 --> 10:04.571
to the kid in the back brace.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.173
He has a name.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.942
I think it's Adnan,
but I'm not positive.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.078
Also, to Adam Goldberg,
for locking up

10:11.211 --> 10:14.347
the AV club's Oscar Award
for his cheeky parody,

10:14.481 --> 10:16.283
"The Second-to-Last
Starfighter."

10:16.416 --> 10:18.085
It definitely put
the original
in its place.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.787
And the rose-kissy thing?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.054
<i>I'm... I'm getting to that.</i>

10:21.188 --> 10:22.522
<i>And you're too close
to the mic.</i>

10:22.656 --> 10:24.257
<i>They can't hear me.
Just say it.
Yeah, okay.</i>

10:24.391 --> 10:27.160
And also remember that
our less-coordinated students

10:27.294 --> 10:28.561
will be honored Friday

10:28.696 --> 10:31.131
at our first annual
Non-Athlete Senior Night.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.333
Invite your mamas.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.602
Non-Athlete
Senior Night?

10:35.736 --> 10:37.070
This is a stretch,
even for you.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.806
Wha?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.640
This attention
isn't real!

10:40.774 --> 10:42.442
Just my mom wants
her own rose ceremony!

10:42.575 --> 10:43.811
A win's a win.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.046
Sydney, I've made a mess.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.420
<i>My sister finally
had a fun captain,</i>

10:53.553 --> 10:55.889
<i>and Joanne's first move
was to call for back-up.</i>

10:56.023 --> 10:57.157
'Sup, fools?
Carla?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.292
I thought you said
you were too busy to help.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.061
That's 'cause I don't like
being in charge,

11:01.194 --> 11:02.662
but I'm happy to be
the getaway driver.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.831
Metaphorically?

11:03.964 --> 11:05.598
Sure. So, what do we got?

11:05.733 --> 11:08.435
I put together a list of
typical bridal activities,

11:08.568 --> 11:10.838
a spa day, brunch, getting
our hair and makeup done.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.205
Ooh, those sound
so normal.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.107
That's why we're doing
none of them.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.811
We're going to
a monster truck rally.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.480
Oh. I went yesterday,
but I'll go again.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.983
I don't know.
That seems really loud.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.617
What if we did
extreme versions

11:24.752 --> 11:25.919
of the stuff
you already crossed off?

11:26.053 --> 11:27.687
Or maybe not extreme at all.

11:27.821 --> 11:28.822
Well, it's your rodeo.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.457
Yes! A prison rodeo!

11:30.590 --> 11:31.859
My cousin's
the head clown.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.260
<i>And with that,</i>

11:33.393 --> 11:35.462
<i>Erica's special day
was gonna be normal.</i>

11:35.595 --> 11:36.629
<i>Kinda.</i>

11:36.764 --> 11:37.865
<i>They hit the spa...</i>

11:37.998 --> 11:39.132
I remove top layer.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.268
Of my skin?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.170
<i>...they
got their makeup done...</i>

11:43.303 --> 11:45.873
Hot damn!
She used every crayon
in the box!

11:46.006 --> 11:47.207
<i>...and finally, brunch.</i>

11:47.340 --> 11:48.942
Here again?
You know it.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.878
They make
a kick-ass potato soup.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.880
It's as hearty and thick
as the men who make it.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.614
More hit?

11:54.748 --> 11:56.516
<i>While Erica's special day
was a bust,</i>

11:56.649 --> 11:59.019
<i>I enlisted some help squashing
my mom's plan</i>

11:59.152 --> 12:01.054
<i>for Non-Athlete Senior Night.</i>

12:01.188 --> 12:02.689
We want you to reverse
the cultural changes

12:02.823 --> 12:04.024
you've made at our school.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.493
Yesterday, I went to
lovingly wedgie a band kid,

12:06.626 --> 12:08.028
but I couldn't because
he was on the shoulders

12:08.161 --> 12:09.562
of five cheerleaders.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.731
Believe me
if it were up to me,
that dweeb's underwear

12:11.865 --> 12:14.734
would be gently
but hilariously
tattered and torn.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.937
And I've gone two days
without someone
decorating my locker.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.471
Have I become a nobody?

12:18.605 --> 12:19.672
You're always somebody
to me.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.074
That means nothing!

12:21.208 --> 12:22.709
None of this makes any sense.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.677
This morning,
that nerd Matt Schernecke

12:24.812 --> 12:26.679
said hi to me
in front of everyone.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.581
So embarrassing!

12:28.715 --> 12:31.118
If Dave Kim's getting
a cupcake from Sydney
the cheerleader,

12:31.251 --> 12:33.020
then my cupcake
doesn't feel special.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.554
I mean, even though
I'm dating Sydney.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.156
Okay, that last argument's
kind of convoluted,

12:36.289 --> 12:37.290
but you get it.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.758
I'm persuaded.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.393
Going back
to the old system.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.362
So, you'll be canceling
Non-Athlete Senior Night?

12:42.495 --> 12:44.764
Oh, that I can't do.
Your mother was very menacing.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.267
And she invoked laws
I'm too lazy to verify.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.902
But nobody wants it!

12:49.036 --> 12:50.370
Guys, help me out here.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.905
We don't care about that.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.706
We just want cheerleaders
to bake us stuff.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.476
I'm sorry, Mr. Goldberg,
fair is fair.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.378
The athletes got
their big night,

12:58.511 --> 13:00.347
the non-athletes get theirs.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.215
<i>Which gave me
a crazy idea,</i>

13:02.349 --> 13:05.218
<i>and that meant there was
only one person to talk to.</i>

13:05.352 --> 13:06.719
I need you to turn me
into an athlete.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.388
Are you talking to me
or God?

13:08.521 --> 13:09.957
'Cause that's a tall order
for either of us.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.658
If I make it onto
a sports team,

13:11.791 --> 13:14.227
I won't have to participate
in Non-Athlete Senior Night.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.997
Fine! Tell me the sport,
I'll make you a legend.

13:17.130 --> 13:17.931
Doesn't matter.
You pick.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.399
Well, I'd rule out anything

13:19.532 --> 13:21.201
that requires a bat,
ball, mitt,

13:21.334 --> 13:23.603
racket, stick, club,
coordination, endurance,
desire,

13:23.736 --> 13:25.172
grit, strategy,
physical contact,

13:25.305 --> 13:26.573
or a commanding voice
for calling signals.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.807
What's left?

13:27.941 --> 13:29.376
Spring track.
In!

13:29.509 --> 13:31.244
What's the minimum
I have to do to make the team?

13:31.378 --> 13:32.512
I only know the maximum.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.780
I don't need the maximum.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.248
I just don't want to go
to this banquet.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.650
Whatever the reason,
you will be transformed

13:37.784 --> 13:39.853
from an undersized sack
of soft garbage

13:39.987 --> 13:41.788
into an explosively
high-performance

13:41.922 --> 13:43.256
muscular super jock.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.791
Why exactly are you embracing
this challenge

13:44.925 --> 13:46.459
with so much intensity?

13:46.593 --> 13:49.196
To prove to Dad that
I am such an elite athlete

13:49.329 --> 13:51.899
that I can even turn
the weakest, scrawniest,

13:52.032 --> 13:55.068
and most pathetic among us
into Dan Marino.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.870
The Isotoner glove model?

13:57.004 --> 13:58.005
I didn't know he did sports.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.806
Your training begins now!

13:59.940 --> 14:01.574
I'm gonna need gravity boots
and a tractor tire.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.176
Let's go!

14:03.310 --> 14:05.512
Here I come,
I guess.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.647
<i>While I'd gotten
Barry's unbridled help,</i>

14:07.780 --> 14:09.516
<i>Erica's bridal shower
was under way.</i>

14:10.217 --> 14:11.284
<i>There was food...</i>

14:11.418 --> 14:12.719
Wait, are you
driving later?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.021
I might be.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.622
I'd stay away from those.

14:15.755 --> 14:16.856
<i>...there were games...</i>

14:16.990 --> 14:20.193
Okay, would Geoff rather
make out in public, or--

14:20.327 --> 14:21.661
Whatever the second thing is.

14:21.794 --> 14:22.862
Correct!

14:22.996 --> 14:24.797
He'd rather die
in a house fire.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.633
<i>...and,
of course, dessert.</i>

14:26.766 --> 14:27.834
Cake time!

14:27.968 --> 14:30.037
Oh, wow, that's big.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.472
Well, it kind of
had to be. You'll see.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.640
Surprise!

14:33.773 --> 14:34.707
Is it time?

14:34.841 --> 14:35.875
It's so dark and scary
in there.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.244
Oh, God.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.012
Erica, you get
the first piece.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.281
Technically the second.
I got pretty hungry
on the van ride over.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.482
That's okay, I'm good.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.851
Why not? Is my boyfriend
not hot enough for you?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.853
That's the thing,
he's too hot.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.956
He's sweating all over
the frosting.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.191
You should be so lucky
as to eat frosting
that touched my man.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.693
Knock, knock!
Groom in the room!

14:53.826 --> 14:55.562
It's okay, Geoff.
There's nothing to see here.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.364
Full disclosure,
it was gonna be me
in the cake,

14:57.497 --> 14:58.698
but with my crippling
claustrophobia,

14:58.831 --> 15:00.067
nobody thought
it was a good idea.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.701
The problem isn't who
was in my cake.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.903
The problem is that
<i>someone</i> was in my cake.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.506
Geez, someone
is hard to please.

15:06.639 --> 15:07.874
Look, it's not your fault
that you planned something

15:08.008 --> 15:09.509
I intensely hate.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.111
You just don't know me at all.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.346
<i>While Erica's shower
had gone off the tracks,</i>

15:13.480 --> 15:16.683
<i>I was still trying to derail
my mom's embarrassing plan.</i>

15:16.816 --> 15:19.552
Schmoop-a-poop, I have
our outfits for our big night.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.555
Wow. So much class
and pizzazz.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.691
It's a shame neither of us
will be wearing those.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.759
As a newly certified
high school athlete,

15:26.893 --> 15:28.028
I will not be attending.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.296
That doesn't make any sense.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.930
You're a think-y,
not a do-y.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.132
I think-y no more.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.933
I'm a badass jock now,

15:34.067 --> 15:35.902
with all the accoutrements
that come with.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.537
Like these incredibly
thin and revealing shorts.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.107
So you joined a sport?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.409
Not just any sport,
track...

15:42.542 --> 15:47.280
A series of athletic contests,
running, jumping... the other.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.349
So, no-can-do
on your big public smooch.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.284
Hmm.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.952
Well, if you put
as much energy
into that

15:53.086 --> 15:55.422
as you did into depriving me
of a moment of thanks,

15:55.555 --> 15:57.390
then you're gonna be
the next Carl Lewis.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.929
Can you believe her?

16:03.063 --> 16:05.232
It's actually <i>you</i>
I can't believe.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.699
What's that
supposed to mean?

16:06.833 --> 16:07.800
Your mom.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.237
She sacrifices everything
for you kids,

16:10.370 --> 16:12.405
her time, her life.
It's all for you.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.374
Still, she made up
an embarrassing event

16:14.507 --> 16:15.775
just so I could give her
a flower.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.610
Because that's how far
she has to go

16:17.744 --> 16:19.412
to get the recognition
she deserves.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.314
I guess.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.949
No one gets through
high school alone.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.918
Everything you did
and you achieved,

16:26.053 --> 16:27.920
she was with you
every step of the way.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.796
<i>In a bitter twist of fate,
my mom had finally gotten</i>

16:36.929 --> 16:38.465
<i>her Non-Athlete Senior Night,</i>

16:38.598 --> 16:41.134
<i>but her favorite non-athlete
was nowhere to be found.</i>

16:41.268 --> 16:43.470
Now I have to pretend to care
about these dorks

16:43.603 --> 16:46.506
who couldn't have gotten off
their butts to play a sport.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.809
And yet you came
and insisted
we sit together.

16:49.942 --> 16:55.682
And now, let's meet
your Non-Athletic Seniors!

16:55.815 --> 16:58.385
This fella guided Yearbook
through three straight years

16:58.518 --> 16:59.852
of deadline-meeting
publication.

16:59.986 --> 17:03.190
Give it up for
Brad Finkelstein!

17:03.323 --> 17:04.624
<i>A funny thing happened
that night.</i>

17:04.757 --> 17:06.093
<i>People realized that</i>

17:06.226 --> 17:09.096
<i>all the things kids
had accomplished off the field</i>

17:09.229 --> 17:10.397
<i>were also pretty cool.</i>

17:10.530 --> 17:13.066
She anchors the math team
and the third chair

17:13.200 --> 17:15.168
in the William Penn orchestra
on the oboe.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.969
O-boe she didn't!

17:17.104 --> 17:19.639
Annie Gerwitz!

17:19.772 --> 17:22.008
<i>Yep,
it was the night my mom
had dreamed of,</i>

17:22.142 --> 17:24.611
<i>but because I wasn't there,
it was just a nightmare.</i>

17:24.744 --> 17:27.414
Next, throughout
his storied career,

17:27.547 --> 17:29.549
this gentleman
put it all out there

17:29.682 --> 17:31.651
on the floor
of the theater!

17:31.784 --> 17:33.086
Adam did theater.

17:33.220 --> 17:36.123
His credits span from "Annie"
to "Xanadu,"

17:36.256 --> 17:37.457
with two others in between.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.691
Adam also did "Annie"

17:38.825 --> 17:40.393
and "Xanadu"
and two others.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.230
He's a two-time president
of the AV club.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.598
Adam was also
two-time president
of the AV club.

17:45.732 --> 17:49.302
And he made our school's
first ever video yearbook.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.470
Adam made
whatever that was!

17:50.603 --> 17:53.640
Everyone, make some noise...

17:53.773 --> 17:59.379
Mr. Movie,
Adam Goldberg!

18:01.381 --> 18:02.415
Yes!

18:03.350 --> 18:06.519
Oh.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.321
<i>Yeah, there was
one more good thing</i>

18:08.455 --> 18:09.656
<i>about being a non-athlete.</i>

18:09.789 --> 18:11.691
He's not here.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.294
<i>I knew how to make
a dramatic entrance.</i>

18:19.532 --> 18:21.501
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.537
But, most of all,
Mom, would you please...

18:25.372 --> 18:27.073
Whoa.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.942
I'd just like to thank
the greatest,

18:30.076 --> 18:32.545
most supportive mom
in the world.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.814
Mom...
Yes.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.184
I've got
a half-inch-deep thorn
in my hand,

18:37.317 --> 18:38.218
and I don't even feel it.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.687
Sorry, Mom.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.290
I realized I didn't
get through high school
all by myself.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.461
My baby cherishes me
and puts me on a pedestal!

18:48.595 --> 18:50.263
Oh!

18:53.433 --> 18:56.603
<i>My mom had finally gotten
the thing she most wanted.</i>

18:56.736 --> 18:59.138
<i>Unfortunately, the same
couldn't be said for Erica.</i>

18:59.272 --> 19:00.273
You okay?

19:00.907 --> 19:01.841
I've been better.

19:01.974 --> 19:02.842
I get it.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.744
I'm lucky.

19:04.877 --> 19:08.948
I've got Barry, the JTP,
all my camp guys.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.050
But your friends aren't around
when you need them.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.151
And that hurts.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.488
You're very good at knowing
how I'm feeling.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.624
That's 'cause I love you.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.492
The worst part is
I was mean to your sister

19:19.626 --> 19:21.160
after she tried so hard.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.396
Then maybe I'm not the one
you should be talking to.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.399
Hey.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.900
Joanne, I'm so, so sorry.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.372
I'm the one
who should be sorry.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.375
I throw myself into things
and try way too hard,

19:35.508 --> 19:38.177
but it's only 'cause I saw
a chance to be closer to you.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.912
Really?
Duh.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.148
What do you think?
I don't want us to be sisters

19:42.282 --> 19:43.783
just because
you're marrying my brother.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.619
I want us to be like
actual sisters.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.655
I always wanted a sister.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.790
Well, then

19:50.923 --> 19:52.292
let me start
with one more thing
I have planned.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.994
Oh, no. I don't need
any more activities.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.796
Are you sure?
'Cause I think I've learned

19:56.929 --> 19:58.130
a little more
about what you like.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.668
<i>In that moment,
Erica realized</i>

20:01.801 --> 20:04.170
<i>that no matter how far apart
your paths may take you,</i>

20:04.304 --> 20:06.573
<i>the most important people
in your life</i>

20:06.706 --> 20:08.741
<i>will always be there for you.</i>

20:08.875 --> 20:10.810
Oh, my God!
What are you guys
doing here?

20:10.943 --> 20:12.645
Joanne reminded us
how important this is.

20:12.779 --> 20:13.646
So we made it happen.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.853
<i>Occasionally,
someone you never expected
steps up</i>

20:20.987 --> 20:23.323
<i>and becomes
one of those people
who means so much.</i>

20:25.157 --> 20:28.661
<i>And sometimes, we realize that
they were there all along.</i>

20:32.799 --> 20:34.000
Oh!

20:34.133 --> 20:35.902
Yes!

20:36.035 --> 20:37.937
<i>But either way,
as long as you've got
your people</i>

20:38.070 --> 20:39.105
<i>by your side...</i>

20:44.777 --> 20:46.879
<i>you'll be a winner
no matter what.</i>

20:50.917 --> 20:54.053
Shopkeep! In addition
to wedding dresses,

20:54.186 --> 20:57.023
does this place sell tuxedos
for both man and penguin?

20:57.156 --> 20:58.658
Oh, no.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.393
Oh. There's my guy.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.861
Hi, Barry.
Hey, Barry.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.263
My current girlfriend,
two former sweethearts,

21:04.397 --> 21:06.599
plus a girl I made out with
at a party once?

21:06.733 --> 21:08.535
In my defense,
I was sober that day.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.203
This is hilarious,
but also...

21:11.338 --> 21:13.272
Oh, my gosh!
Look at how red he's getting.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.507
Let's turn this up
a notch.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.008
Which one of us
is the best kisser?

21:16.142 --> 21:17.877
I-I couldn't possibly...

21:18.010 --> 21:19.078
But I could.

21:20.179 --> 21:22.081
Mama always
wins best kisser,

21:22.214 --> 21:23.249
no contest.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.884
C'mon.
Let's show 'em how.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.619
This day is so much better
than I could have hoped for.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.020
Let me go!
Let me go!

21:28.154 --> 21:29.021
No! No!
