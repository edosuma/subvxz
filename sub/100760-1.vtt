13:07.037 --> 13:09.498
- stat. Any drug
allergies, Nathan?
No.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.124
I'm fine.
I really think I'm fine.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.503
- When's your birthday?
- It's on the brif of Febinary.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.005
Oh, God, you're not okay.
I should have waited for you.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.174
- I should go home.
- Sit down, please.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.467
Okay.

13:20.509 --> 13:21.694
His vitals are dropping.
We're losing him.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.802
We really want to upload,

13:22.844 --> 13:23.988
and I don't want
to miss the window.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.972
- Is the paperwork
all filled out?
- No.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.074
Heaven sales rep to the ER.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.892
- What?
- Can't upload a dead body.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.143
Oh, man.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.770
We got to get a move on now.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.706
-Someone's going to heaven?
-Horizen Lakeview, please?
-No.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.315
I need to start
with the Horizen ID.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.776
Yes, Ingrid Kannerman.
Capital P,

13:37.817 --> 13:40.862
- "panorama," ampersand, 2002.
- No.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.322
I really don't think
we need upload.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.490
I'm feeling pretty chill.

13:43.532 --> 13:45.450
- Vitals are still going down.
- She's wrong.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.118
Baby, don't try
and tough this out, okay?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.246
Now, you could just
old-fashioned die,

13:49.287 --> 13:50.789
or we could

13:50.830 --> 13:53.375
be together forever.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.336
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:56.378 --> 13:59.047
You know that I think

13:59.089 --> 14:00.882
you are so amazing.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.425
- You...
- But...

14:02.467 --> 14:04.469
- But, uh...
- But what?

14:04.511 --> 14:05.929
But forever is just, like,

14:05.971 --> 14:08.640
so long to think about.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.351
Okay, so you would rather die
than be with me?

14:11.393 --> 14:13.478
- Is that what...
Is that what you...
- No. No, no.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.748
- You would rather die
than be with...
- No, no. Don't cry.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.124
- Please don't cry.
Oh, just... Oh.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.441
There's people around.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.610
No, of course
I want to be with you.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.445
- Hit accept.
- What?

14:22.487 --> 14:23.947
What the hell am I accepting?

14:23.989 --> 14:25.282
Our terms of service.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.867
You can't just accept it
without reading them.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.327
Well, you can't use our service

14:29.369 --> 14:31.204
without agreeing
to the terms of service.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.331
Have you never gotten
an app ever?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.959
Fuck.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.961
What are my chances here?

14:38.003 --> 14:39.939
Unless your system rallies,
you're currently dying

14:39.963 --> 14:41.590
of a punctured lung. I'm sorry.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.384
This is insane.
I'm only 27.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.761
What do you want to do?

14:46.803 --> 14:48.680
Upload's that way,
OR's the other way.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.890
Hey.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.727
Just sign the thing, okay?

14:53.768 --> 14:55.312
Don't do it.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.981
- There's still sex, right?
- Uh, yeah.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.900
The VR suits are amazing.
You can change your avatar,

15:00.942 --> 15:03.194
boost levels, stimulation
you wouldn't believe.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.864
Super.
Okay, where's my mom?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.550
- I got to talk to her.
- Mm, that's disgusting.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.783
- Not about that.
- Well...

15:08.825 --> 15:10.994
- Grow up.
- Nathan, please.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.663
We are out of time.
Just do the right thing

15:13.705 --> 15:17.208
and make me
the happiest woman in...

15:17.250 --> 15:18.793
Oh, fine. Fine.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.629
- Whatever. Yeah.
- Oh! Yeah?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.130
Oh, this is gonna be so great.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.882
- Super.
- Heading to UR Two.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.635
This'll be great.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.220
If not, it's only eternity.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.812
Hello, I'm Abel.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.106
I'll be
your scanning technician.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.941
This won't hurt.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.152
So, once the shutters
are up to speed,

15:44.194 --> 15:45.695
scanner will start recording.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.948
I'm jealous, man.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.242
Lakeview is plush.

16:01.336 --> 16:03.546
This thing.

16:03.588 --> 16:07.050
- What's that for?
- It's just for storage.

16:07.092 --> 16:10.053
Have fun.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.520
Can we just hit the pause button
here for a second?

16:18.561 --> 16:20.522
Please look forward at the spot

16:20.563 --> 16:22.107
in front of you.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.653
Oh, thank God. Mom!

16:29.114 --> 16:30.865
Upload complete.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.373
Hello, Nathan.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.709
I'm not expecting you
to answer me yet.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.853
The system is sorting through
a lot of your information,

16:42.877 --> 16:44.963
but I'm going to count to three.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.298
Try to count with me.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.094
One, two, three.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.348
Welcome to upload, Nathan.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.434
You made it to Lakeview,
you lucky duck.

17:00.562 --> 17:03.648
I want you to think of yourself.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.941
The "I" in the sentence,

17:04.983 --> 17:07.902
"I think, therefore I am."

17:09.362 --> 17:10.655
Okay, cool.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.658
Just gonna grab that.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.951
That'll be your password.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.202
Or passthought.

17:16.244 --> 17:18.288
I'll always be able to use that

17:18.329 --> 17:19.622
to recognize you.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.167
Now, remember kindergarten?

17:22.208 --> 17:24.002
The alphabet song?

17:24.043 --> 17:27.172
♪ A-B-C-D-E-F-G. ♪

17:27.213 --> 17:28.882
Think that for me.

17:28.923 --> 17:31.760
Yeah. Good.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.179
Now think of

17:34.220 --> 17:35.346
the color blue.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.600
Light blue like a clear sky.

17:38.641 --> 17:41.311
Dark blue like a mountain lake.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.438
Yellow sunshine.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.106
Forest green.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.941
Brown wood.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.943
Perfect.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.862
I'm feeling pins and needles.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.990
Why do people always set it
for Australian accent?

17:54.032 --> 17:55.950
Say again, please?

17:55.992 --> 17:57.285
Pins and needles.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.287
There we go. That's
a lot better voice for you.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.538
Yours is nice, too.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.248
Yeah, pins and needles

18:02.290 --> 18:04.584
is just the program
finding your nerve endings.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.669
Do you see anything?

18:08.713 --> 18:11.674
Some kind of old-fashioned room.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.635
Looking over a lake.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.386
Beautiful trees.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.847
Whoa, a shark swimming
right towards me.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.283
What? Okay, no,
that's not supposed to happen.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.184
Kidding. Kidding.

18:21.226 --> 18:24.187
Sense of humor. Nice.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.941
Um, so, welcome to

18:27.982 --> 18:30.443
Lakeview by Horizen,

18:30.485 --> 18:31.986
the only digital afterlife
environment

18:32.028 --> 18:34.197
modeled on
the grand Victorian hotels

18:34.239 --> 18:35.782
of the United States and Canada.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.700
Hope it's not too
Ralph Lauren for you.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.285
I mean, it was
never really my thing,

18:39.327 --> 18:41.037
- but it's kind of cool.
- Yeah.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.664
Uplifting views,
healthy pursuits,

18:42.705 --> 18:44.290
timeless Americana.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.292
Are there slaves?

18:46.334 --> 18:48.837
What?
Are... are you serious?

18:48.878 --> 18:51.756
- I just...
- One, this is just
a design scheme.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.883
And two, that's not even
the right period.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.510
Lakeview is open

18:55.552 --> 18:59.138
to all races, religions,
genders... absolutely anybody.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.434
I see you've selected

19:03.476 --> 19:05.895
"nondenominational charismatic

19:05.937 --> 19:07.438
Christian" as your creed.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.815
That means, for you,

19:08.857 --> 19:10.775
the little chapel
east of the hotel

19:10.817 --> 19:12.819
will be a Pentecostal church.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.238
For someone else,
the same building could be

19:15.280 --> 19:17.907
a mosque
or even a bowling alley.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.159
- I'll take the bowling alley.
- I can make

19:20.201 --> 19:21.953
that change.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.872
I'm just gonna need
your Horizen password.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.958
Um... uh, BrunoMelrose18.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.378
Your first dog
and the street you grew up on?

19:30.420 --> 19:32.213
You used your porn name?

19:32.255 --> 19:34.465
Pretty poor security
for a coder.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.925
Excuse me?

19:35.967 --> 19:37.510
Uh, it didn't work.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.721
Your charges are going

19:39.762 --> 19:41.472
to an Ingrid Kannerman.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.474
Oh, yeah.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.934
Well, there's lots

19:44.976 --> 19:46.519
of free activities.
I mean...

19:46.561 --> 19:48.980
Hike up to a gazebo.
Swim in the lake.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.607
Take a class.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.191
Uh-oh.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.610
Nathan?

19:53.651 --> 19:55.945
Nathan, are you okay?

19:55.987 --> 19:58.406
Yeah. Yep.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.327
I don't know.
No. No.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.038
Hey.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.331
Don't be embarrassed.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.957
It can be really hard.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.751
To die, I mean.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.669
Especially when
you're young and hands...

20:11.711 --> 20:13.796
um, healthy.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.465
Unexpected uploads

20:15.506 --> 20:17.842
often have trouble adjusting.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.470
But remember, they froze
your body, so who knows?

20:20.511 --> 20:22.180
You... Maybe one day,
they figure out

20:22.221 --> 20:23.681
how to put you back in.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.683
Yeah, thanks.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.685
What's your name?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.979
Well, you're supposed
to just refer to me

20:30.021 --> 20:32.440
as your angel.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.984
Are you... are you alive
or dead, too?

20:35.026 --> 20:37.111
Or... some AI?

20:37.153 --> 20:39.405
I'm not allowed to say.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.199
Sorry.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.035
But anytime you need me,
I'll be here for you.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.871
Just ask,
and I'll be right in your ear.

20:47.872 --> 20:51.167
Okay. Angel.

20:53.211 --> 20:56.839
All right,
you are all connected now.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.092
Do you look real to yourself?

20:59.133 --> 21:01.844
Ten fingers and toes?

21:01.886 --> 21:04.180
- Pretty seamless.
- Great.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.598
Well, explore.
Enjoy.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.016
You'll meet your fellow uploads.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.894
Just let it sink in
how lucky you are.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.604
This is the first day

21:11.646 --> 21:13.982
of the rest of your afterlife.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.818
Yeah. Yeah.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.945
Cool. Thanks.

21:33.501 --> 21:34.711
Hey.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.254
Oh, hey.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.089
You're still here.
Cool.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.216
This was a big day.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.926
You died and were reborn.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.761
That's a lot to process.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.221
Yeah, it is.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.265
Tomorrow will be better.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.100
You'll see.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.268
Just get some rest.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.477
Yeah, there's no way

21:51.519 --> 21:54.147
I'm gonna be able
to fall asleep.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.279
Aw.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.948
- You think it'll take?
- Don't know.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.826
What's the rejection rate
for the unprepared?

22:06.868 --> 22:08.703
- Mm.
- 40%?

22:08.745 --> 22:11.289
For me, it's 60.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.333
I've been written up
so many times.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.716
♪ ♪

22:36.814 --> 22:38.524
She was right.

22:38.566 --> 22:41.069
Oh, my God, this is fantastic.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.156
Oh.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.533
Oh, yeah.

22:47.575 --> 22:50.078
Yes, water pressure.

22:50.119 --> 22:52.080
Oh, my God.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.377
What the hell is this?

23:22.819 --> 23:24.695
Angel?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.322
- Yes, Nathan?
- Holy...

23:26.364 --> 23:27.782
shit.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.951
Hey, man. How-how
did you get in my room?

23:29.992 --> 23:30.952
All right, don't freak.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.370
- Okay.
- When you call

23:32.411 --> 23:34.038
for an angel, you get an angel.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.708
It's just VR so I can visit you
in person, you know?

23:37.750 --> 23:39.919

35:30.671 --> 35:33.841
Hey, man, um, I've seen ads
for Lakeview for years.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.722
Where is everybody?
I thought this was supposed

35:35.759 --> 35:37.302
to be a super popular spot?

35:37.344 --> 35:38.804
Well, yeah, th-they're all here.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.430
You can only see five floors
at a time.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.057
Like, what's your suite number?

35:42.099 --> 35:43.267
10556.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.018
Okay. Check it out.

35:50.566 --> 35:52.609
You're on floor 10,500.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.903
And we all use the same map.
So, like,

35:54.945 --> 35:57.257
there's a million people down
there on that lake right now.

35:57.281 --> 35:59.533
And you can tell
because the frame rate drops.

35:59.575 --> 36:00.951
Mira, mira, mira.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.160
Oh, yeah.

36:02.202 --> 36:04.288
Eh, it just kind of looks off.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.623
There's something kind of off
about you, too, man.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.542
You wearing a wig or something?

36:08.584 --> 36:09.918
No.
God, no. No.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.378
It's-it's not my normal hair.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.921
They programmed it wrong
or something.

36:12.963 --> 36:14.298
It's driving me nuts.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.258
- Yeah, well, sometimes...
- At home, I use

36:16.300 --> 36:17.861
this natural sculpting cream
and anti-frizz pomade,

36:17.885 --> 36:20.137
but here you're at their mercy,
I guess.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.513
- Right. Well, they...
- Ugh.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.849
A wig.
What?

36:23.891 --> 36:24.892
You are hilarious.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.060
- It's not a wig. It's...
- All right, man.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.354
Oh, no. No, it's this place.

36:29.396 --> 36:31.440
This fucking place!

36:31.481 --> 36:33.609
Mr. Brown.

36:36.612 --> 36:39.323
- Mr. Brown.
- Ugh, come on.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.290
- Piece of gum?
- Ah, no.

36:48.332 --> 36:49.666
No. Thank you.

36:49.708 --> 36:50.751
Keep it together, man.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.711
I'm trying.

36:52.753 --> 36:54.046
Gum.
Orbit gum.

36:54.087 --> 36:55.172
G-G-G-Gum.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.214
G-G-Gum.

36:56.256 --> 36:57.591
- G-Gum. Gum.
- Mr. Brown.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.301
No. No.

36:59.343 --> 37:00.385
Taking the stairs.

37:00.427 --> 37:01.428
Orbit gum.
Gum.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.724
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:05.766 --> 37:07.366
So I got this friend
who's having a party

37:07.392 --> 37:09.686
in a sick loft on Friday night.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.522
He's got, like, a thousand
Dopanols, I've seen 'em.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.025
Yeah.
No, it's not for me.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.319
Hey, you-you should go out
sometime.

37:17.361 --> 37:19.571
You know, get a little
fucked up, have some fun.

37:19.613 --> 37:20.906
I go out plenty.

37:20.948 --> 37:23.617
Just not gonna be tripping
with you in some loft.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.202
- I'm not there yet.
- Oh. No.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.703
Okay, I get it.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.330
I guess a nice guy
can't win with you.

37:28.372 --> 37:30.582
I guess I'm stuck
in the friend zone.

37:30.624 --> 37:32.876
Okay.
Bye, friend.

37:34.962 --> 37:36.672
Be here now.

37:36.713 --> 37:39.800
Be... here...

37:39.841 --> 37:42.678
mm, now. Mm.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.304
It's all good.

37:44.346 --> 37:46.348
Gonna live forever.

37:47.516 --> 37:49.184
Oh, God.

37:49.226 --> 37:50.978
Damn.

37:52.646 --> 37:55.190
Son of a... bitch!

38:00.862 --> 38:03.365
Nora, are you in there?

38:03.407 --> 38:05.200
Your new boy is freaking out.

38:05.242 --> 38:06.970
The hot dude... he's hiking up
near the torrent.

38:06.994 --> 38:08.328
Shit.
Thanks.

38:31.018 --> 38:32.602
Hey!

38:32.644 --> 38:35.022
Shit.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.982
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.582
Hey, Nathan, wait up.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.210
I remember that voice.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.563
So it's your shift now.
You know, you work

38:58.587 --> 39:00.005
for a really fucked-up thing.

39:00.047 --> 39:01.757
This is a bad idea.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.009
The ads make it seem great,
but it is fucking monstrous.

39:04.051 --> 39:06.303
Okay, so maybe not
the best first day.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.739
And, I mean, these rules
that don't make any sense.

39:07.763 --> 39:09.563
I mean, I farted,
which is already, like, why?

39:09.598 --> 39:11.183
Just a weird detail.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.077
And it was like someone spritzed
the room with cologne.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.811
Okay, well,
it's supposed to be heaven.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.104
- How is that heaven?
- Well,

39:16.146 --> 39:17.290
if you're stuck in an elevator

39:17.314 --> 39:18.732
with another guest...

39:18.774 --> 39:20.108
And this is
a small thing, maybe,

39:20.150 --> 39:21.794
but what the hell
is going on with my hair?

39:21.818 --> 39:23.320
How does this even happen?

39:23.361 --> 39:24.780
I swear to God, it's like

39:24.821 --> 39:26.615
someone's fucking with me
on purpose.

39:28.492 --> 39:29.844
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna take a look

39:29.868 --> 39:31.453
over that edge,
maybe I can see home.

39:31.495 --> 39:33.097
Wait. You realize if you jump
in that thing,

39:33.121 --> 39:34.599
you don't go anywhere,
you just disappear,

39:34.623 --> 39:36.017
and there's nothing left
to re-scan.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.601
Maybe that's my tough luck,
but it's how

39:37.626 --> 39:39.312
- it's supposed to go down.
- Oh, so you're super

39:39.336 --> 39:41.439
old-school religious, too.
You agree with Neil Beagly.

39:41.463 --> 39:44.091
- Who's Neil Beagly?
- He was a 16-year-old boy

39:44.132 --> 39:45.777
who died of a fucking UTI
'cause he refused

39:45.801 --> 39:47.028
medical treatment
for religious reasons,

39:47.052 --> 39:48.053
you agree with him?

39:48.095 --> 39:49.554
No, that's fucked up.

39:49.596 --> 39:51.848
- Exactly.
- But I did die.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.143
Okay, what was the first thing
I asked you to think of?

39:56.561 --> 39:57.771
I don't know.

39:57.813 --> 39:58.855
My ABCs?

39:58.897 --> 40:00.357
No.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.067
Yourself.

40:02.109 --> 40:03.860
I think, therefore I am.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.570
Hey, that "I" didn't die.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.292
That's consciousness,
and that's what we're

40:07.322 --> 40:08.990
in the business
of keeping going.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.551
All right, why do you think
it feels weird

40:10.575 --> 40:11.993
and unnatural here?

40:12.035 --> 40:13.870
Because your consciousness

40:13.912 --> 40:16.414
can think and compare
with your memories.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.208
That's still you.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.835
You know, doing what
you always did,

40:19.876 --> 40:21.920
thinking and being alive.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.602
And I'm sure
there are plenty of people...

40:23.630 --> 40:25.733
Including me, for one...
That are glad you're still here.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.551
You don't even know me.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.928
Not yet, but I'd like to.

40:31.138 --> 40:34.224
I get it. You know,
this isn't perfect.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.476
And maybe you were
led to believe it would be,

40:36.518 --> 40:40.438
since the marketing mentions
heaven, like, a dozen times.

40:40.480 --> 40:44.151
But it's kind of better,
isn't it?

40:44.192 --> 40:45.861
I mean, maybe the imperfections

40:45.902 --> 40:48.363
make it more like life,

40:48.405 --> 40:51.116
'cause life isn't perfect.

40:51.158 --> 40:53.952
But life is the most
magical gift there is,

40:53.994 --> 40:57.122
and if there's God,
he's amazing,

40:57.164 --> 40:59.291
because he gave us life
and the gratitude

40:59.332 --> 41:02.836
and creativity to keep it going
as long as we possibly can.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.634
You're good.

41:11.178 --> 41:13.221
Yeah.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.808
You're a living person.

41:16.850 --> 41:18.977
Yeah, AI doesn't talk like that

41:19.019 --> 41:22.522
with pain and passion.
Soul.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.941
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.526
Is this what you look like
for real?

41:26.568 --> 41:28.945
You're not some old woman
or a dude or something?

41:28.987 --> 41:31.823
No, this is me.

41:31.865 --> 41:34.784
I mean, my avatar has makeup on,

41:34.826 --> 41:36.912
my hair's nice and I'm not
in sweatpants,

41:36.953 --> 41:38.455
so a little better than normal

41:38.496 --> 41:39.998
but nothing else is tweaked.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.791
Good for you, then.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.251
You're really pretty.

41:43.293 --> 41:44.794
But I'm not allowed

41:44.836 --> 41:45.921
to know your name.

41:45.962 --> 41:47.339
No.

41:47.380 --> 41:48.840
I could get in trouble.

41:48.882 --> 41:50.300
It's a policy.

41:51.801 --> 41:54.554
Yeah, it's a policy.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.476
My name's Nora.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.852
I live in Ozone Park, Queens.

42:00.894 --> 42:03.104
My apartment's about as big

42:03.146 --> 42:05.315
as your bathroom,
but I'm at work now,

42:05.357 --> 42:08.193
which is in Dumbo, Brooklyn.

42:08.235 --> 42:10.528
It's a really cold day,

42:10.570 --> 42:12.989
and the bitch
a couple of desks down

42:13.031 --> 42:15.200
is taking forever to finish
a tuna sandwich

42:15.242 --> 42:18.245
that I'm seriously considering
chucking out the window.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.624
Nora Antony.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.046
Nice to meet you.

42:28.088 --> 42:29.673
Likewise.

42:31.508 --> 42:32.801
Can we go home now?

42:38.014 --> 42:39.266
Yeah, okay.

42:43.937 --> 42:46.231
So what's your favorite smell?

42:46.273 --> 42:49.150
I don't know.
Fresh-baked cinnamon rolls.

42:51.361 --> 42:52.779
Ew, you weirdo.

42:52.821 --> 42:53.989
Smell it.

42:54.990 --> 42:57.033
Smell it.

42:58.618 --> 42:59.953
Oh.

42:59.995 --> 43:03.581
You sick genius.

43:22.767 --> 43:23.727
It's 6:00 p.m.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.770
Day shift is over.

43:25.812 --> 43:27.188
I'm out.

43:29.107 --> 43:31.985
Hey, you want to grab a taco
from the taco drone?

43:32.027 --> 43:35.113
Nah. I got carne asada
all over my hair last time.

43:35.155 --> 43:37.073
Ooh.
