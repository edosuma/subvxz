WEBVTT

00:01.283 --> 00:04.018
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.086 --> 00:07.021
FRASIER:
Good evening, gentlemen.

00:07.089 --> 00:08.906
What mindless divertissement

00:08.974 --> 00:11.459
occupies your waning
attention span tonight?

00:11.527 --> 00:13.637
It's the, uh,
National Cable Ace Awards...

00:13.696 --> 00:16.731
given for excellence in all
facets of cable programming.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.032
I stand corrected.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.002
Are you watching
for any particular category?

00:21.003 --> 00:22.554
Yes, the most impressive display

00:22.555 --> 00:25.223
of female flesh in the, uh,
tight-fitting dress.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.425
You're watching for cleavage.

00:27.493 --> 00:29.110
Living for cleavage.

00:29.111 --> 00:31.997
Stunning super model Kim Alexis

00:31.998 --> 00:34.099
is listed as
a presenter. Yeah.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.633
Yeah, Kim Alexis.

00:35.701 --> 00:38.636
Boy, how often her lovely form
has graced the pages

00:38.637 --> 00:40.939
of the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Issue, huh? Yeah.

00:40.940 --> 00:44.676
And how often some youngster
slipped underneath the blankets

00:44.677 --> 00:47.079
with a flashlight
and looked at the same issue

00:47.080 --> 00:49.490
while their mother pounds
on the door and says,

00:49.491 --> 00:51.316
"It's past your bedtime,
Clifford!"

00:51.317 --> 00:53.918
(chuckles)

00:57.272 --> 01:00.341
Or whatever the lad's name
happens to be.

01:46.672 --> 01:49.590
Hey, Dr. Crane, you know,
tomorrow's the big day

01:49.658 --> 01:51.993
I'm getting sworn in
in Boston City Council.

01:52.061 --> 01:54.663
Oh, yes, the beginning
of your political career.

01:54.730 --> 01:58.833
It started out as a small joke
and turned into an enormous one.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.819
Yeah, and listen,
I was wondering if

02:00.820 --> 02:03.188
maybe you could help me out
with the speech I'm giving.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.706
Well, of course I'll take
a look at it, Woody.

02:05.775 --> 02:07.041
Where is it?

02:07.042 --> 02:08.658
Well, I, you know,
I was wondering

02:08.660 --> 02:10.350
if maybe you could
write it for me.

02:10.395 --> 02:14.048
All right, I'll be your
speech writer, Woody.

02:14.049 --> 02:16.250
What ideas would you
like to incorporate?

02:16.251 --> 02:21.021
Okay. Looks like I'm gonna
need one more favour.

02:22.008 --> 02:24.859
(chuckling)

02:24.927 --> 02:26.093
Welcome to Cheers.

02:26.161 --> 02:28.797
Can I take your
order, handsome?

02:28.864 --> 02:31.232
Can I be your order, handsome?

02:31.300 --> 02:32.867
Cutty Sark neat, please.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.002
Okay. Would you
like that in a glass

02:35.070 --> 02:38.740
or shall I pour it over myself
and let you lick it off?

02:38.808 --> 02:41.743
Come on, Carla,
this happens to be my guy.

02:41.811 --> 02:44.245
Yeah, well, I can fix
that in ten minutes.

02:44.313 --> 02:46.897
Five- if I use jumper cables
and a wet towel.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.468
Listen to me- "my guy."

02:50.536 --> 02:53.805
That feels good
to say, "my guy."

02:53.873 --> 02:55.172
Hi.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.658
(giggling)

02:56.725 --> 02:58.393
Hi.

02:58.460 --> 03:00.528
Oh, uh, Rebecca, listen.

03:00.529 --> 03:02.530
There's something really
important I've been wanting

03:02.531 --> 03:06.684
to ask you all night, but, uh,
I guess I'm just too nervous.

03:06.752 --> 03:09.520
Uh, well, y-you know,
I'm a plumber

03:09.588 --> 03:12.490
and I'm not very good
with words and, uh...

03:12.557 --> 03:14.125
Oh, why don't we just forget it.

03:14.193 --> 03:15.443
No!
No-no-no-no!

03:15.444 --> 03:17.812
Wait, wh-why don't you just
sit here and relax

03:17.813 --> 03:20.481
and, uh, you think about that
question you want to pop

03:20.482 --> 03:22.617
and, uh, I-I'll get
us some champagne

03:22.685 --> 03:25.119
so that we can celebrate
the answer.

03:26.705 --> 03:28.875
TV ANNOUNCER:
And our next presenters are

03:28.924 --> 03:32.861
Salman Rushdie and Dr. Ruth.
(applause)

03:32.928 --> 03:35.880
(remote clicks)
Sleepy time down South, huh?

03:37.666 --> 03:39.200
Hey, everybody.

03:39.201 --> 03:40.702
REBECCA: Oh.
CLIFF: Hey, Sam.

03:40.703 --> 03:42.704
Sam, come here, you're just
the guy I want to talk to.

03:42.705 --> 03:44.072
Come here.
Where have you been?

03:44.073 --> 03:48.743
Well, the sex compulsion
therapy group thing.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.680
Yeah. We're all real
proud of you with that.

03:51.681 --> 03:52.914
How's that thing going?

03:52.915 --> 03:54.816
Uh, slow but painful.

03:54.884 --> 03:58.419
This week I'm not gonna
think about sex at all

03:58.487 --> 04:02.891
or even hear about or talk
about anything remotely sexual.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.942
Sam, it's about my love life.

04:05.010 --> 04:07.661
Yeah, that should be safe.

04:07.729 --> 04:09.998
Listen, I think

04:09.999 --> 04:12.500
the most important thing in
my life is about to happen.

04:12.501 --> 04:13.902
Don is gonna propose to me.

04:13.969 --> 04:15.469
Oh!
No, shh...!

04:15.470 --> 04:17.721
REBECCA: But he's having a
little bit of a hard time...

04:17.723 --> 04:19.640
he's sort of shy and he
can't really spit it out,

04:19.641 --> 04:22.610
so I'm gonna coax him along by
giving him a little champagne.

04:22.611 --> 04:24.446
Do you think
that's a good idea?

04:24.513 --> 04:26.563
Oh, that's the best idea
I've ever heard.

04:26.598 --> 04:28.900
Listen, uh, let me buy
the champagne...

04:28.901 --> 04:29.917
the best stuff I've got.

04:29.918 --> 04:31.051
Best stuff.

04:31.052 --> 04:32.337
Wh-Wh-Which
is the best stuff?

04:32.338 --> 04:35.173
Uh, it's the bottle with
the Flintstones on it.

04:36.434 --> 04:39.910
Wh-What you watchin' there,
guys?

04:39.911 --> 04:41.479
The Cable Ace Awards, Sammy.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.147
Yeah. We're
breathlessly awaiting

04:43.148 --> 04:45.798
the appearance of stunning
super model, Kim Alexis.

04:45.851 --> 04:47.568
She the one with the great...

04:47.569 --> 04:48.636
Yeah, yeah.

04:48.637 --> 04:49.904
See you.

04:51.373 --> 04:53.107
Aw, poor Sammy.

04:53.174 --> 04:54.575
NORM:
Breaks my heart.

04:54.576 --> 04:57.095
First the man has to give up
drinking and now women.

04:57.096 --> 04:58.929
Yeah. Boy...

04:58.998 --> 05:01.048
there's no way in
hell Clifford C. Clavin

05:01.049 --> 05:02.233
could ever give up babes.

05:02.234 --> 05:05.169
(chuckles) I'd explode.

05:05.237 --> 05:07.722
I know where you're
coming from.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.292
You've got to understand, Don.

05:11.359 --> 05:13.661
I've always been
at a disadvantage.

05:13.729 --> 05:15.263
(sighs)

05:15.331 --> 05:19.867
See, I was born with only
one erogenous zone, and...

05:19.935 --> 05:24.705
unfortunately, it
covers my entire body.

05:24.773 --> 05:27.074
That's why I've had
to work extra hard

05:27.142 --> 05:29.510
to get to where I am today.

05:29.578 --> 05:32.213
Frankly, Carla, uh,

05:32.281 --> 05:34.315
I don't think
I could satisfy you.

05:34.383 --> 05:38.819
I'm not sure the men of Desert
Storm could satisfy you.

05:38.887 --> 05:40.238
Carla, will you excuse us?

05:40.239 --> 05:42.306
Don and I are in the middle of
a very important conversation.

05:42.307 --> 05:43.357
So are we.

05:43.408 --> 05:45.176
Carla, shoo!

05:45.244 --> 05:48.579
Okay, I'll leave
you alone with your handsome plumber.

05:51.867 --> 05:53.300
Don...
Mm.

05:53.368 --> 05:56.471
You, uh, you said
that you had something

05:56.538 --> 05:59.607
that you wanted to ask me?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.227
Well...

06:03.295 --> 06:07.865
Rebecca, we've only known each
other a very short time, and...

06:07.933 --> 06:10.768
but in that time, I've come
to care for you very deeply.

06:10.835 --> 06:12.887
And...

06:12.888 --> 06:14.755
I've been happier with you
than anyone else

06:14.756 --> 06:17.591
and I... I don't want
that happiness to ever end.

06:17.659 --> 06:19.927
Rebecca,

06:19.995 --> 06:23.364
will you m-m-m-marry me?

06:23.431 --> 06:25.833
(gasping):
Oh, Don!

06:25.901 --> 06:27.702
Of course I won't!

06:27.769 --> 06:28.836
Huh?

06:28.904 --> 06:29.954
What?

06:31.773 --> 06:33.541
That was, that was a mistake.

06:33.542 --> 06:34.608
Ask me again.

06:34.609 --> 06:36.443
Will you marry me?

06:36.511 --> 06:37.695
No!

06:37.763 --> 06:39.447
Oh!

06:39.515 --> 06:41.949
What the hell is happening?!

06:41.950 --> 06:43.351
Rebecca, are you okay?
Yeah.

06:43.352 --> 06:45.620
D-D-Don, hold it.
Just sit there one second.

06:45.621 --> 06:48.856
(sotto voce):
"Rebecca will you marry me?"

06:48.857 --> 06:50.558
Oh, I love you so much, Don.

06:50.626 --> 06:51.892
Of course I'll marry you.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.894
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

06:53.962 --> 06:55.647
Okay, Don, ask me quick.

06:57.549 --> 07:00.134
Rebecca, will you marry me?

07:00.202 --> 07:01.302
Never!

07:01.369 --> 07:02.503
Oh!

07:02.571 --> 07:04.538
I don't know what's happening!

07:04.606 --> 07:05.990
Oh, well, I do!

07:06.057 --> 07:08.947
You obviously don't feel about
me the way I feel about you.

07:09.978 --> 07:11.629
See you around, Rebecca.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.631
Nice knowing you.

07:15.801 --> 07:19.269
(sobbing)

07:24.359 --> 07:26.627
Rebecca...

07:26.695 --> 07:28.629
Rebecca, are you all right?

07:28.697 --> 07:30.631
Yes, thank you!

07:30.699 --> 07:32.767
Oh, God!

07:32.834 --> 07:36.938
Oh, I just let the man that I
love walk right out of my life.

07:37.005 --> 07:40.174
Oh, please, Frasier,
go get him.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.576
Oh, okay, of course.

07:41.577 --> 07:42.644
Wait!

07:42.645 --> 07:43.944
Wait a minute.

07:44.012 --> 07:46.197
Maybe I said no because
deep down inside,

07:46.198 --> 07:48.666
I know that we haven't known
each other long enough.

07:48.667 --> 07:51.452
(sighs)
Yet if he walks out now,

07:51.520 --> 07:53.571
I may never see him
for the rest of my life.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.973
Oh, come on, girl.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.841
Take a chance.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.659
All right.
Go, go, go, go!

07:58.727 --> 08:00.628
No! Hold it!

08:00.629 --> 08:02.096
No, I mean, maybe, maybe I know

08:02.097 --> 08:04.815
that this just isn't the right
thing to do, deep down inside.

08:04.816 --> 08:07.034
Wait a minute,
I've got it. I've got it.

08:07.102 --> 08:08.569
I-I'm just gonna do nothing.

08:08.637 --> 08:10.337
Absolutely nothing.

08:10.405 --> 08:12.006
I'm just gonna sit down here

08:12.074 --> 08:15.442
and pretend like the whole thing
was a dream.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.229
(shouting):
Run, Don! Run!

08:19.297 --> 08:20.898
Run like the wind!

08:28.473 --> 08:30.043
Norm, hey, Norm, new category.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.259
This may be the end of
our long, dark night.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.061
TV ANNOUNCER:
And now to present the award

08:34.062 --> 08:36.364
for best writing in a movie
or miniseries,

08:36.431 --> 08:38.198
here are super model, Kim Alexis

08:38.265 --> 08:42.370
and Hall of Fame player
and coach, Mike Ditka.

08:42.437 --> 08:46.573
(hooting) (barking) (barking)

08:46.641 --> 08:47.875
Thank you.

08:47.942 --> 08:49.210
Thank you.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.612
You know, Coach,
I was wondering,

08:51.680 --> 08:56.016
which one of us has had the most
coverage in Sports Illustrated?

08:56.084 --> 08:57.685
No contest, Kim.

08:57.752 --> 08:59.187
That would be me.

08:59.188 --> 09:01.522
Oh, you mean because you've
had so many great years

09:01.523 --> 09:04.124
on the gridiron as being both
a player and a coach, right?

09:04.125 --> 09:06.835
No, I mean because when I've
seen you in the magazine,

09:06.836 --> 09:08.696
you've had very little
coverage at all.

09:08.697 --> 09:10.030
Oh, you.

09:10.098 --> 09:12.900
(hooting) (hooting) (laughing)

09:12.968 --> 09:14.652
You know, I think it's unfair.

09:14.653 --> 09:16.054
I think that they should do

09:16.055 --> 09:18.089
an issue featuring
swimsuits for men.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.424
Great idea.

09:19.491 --> 09:23.561
The only thing is, the ladies
have to model the suits.

09:23.628 --> 09:26.214
(howling) (hooting)

09:26.215 --> 09:27.748
Coach, you're incorrigible.

09:27.749 --> 09:30.017
I don't write it,
I just say it.

09:30.085 --> 09:32.786
Shall we present the nominees

09:32.854 --> 09:35.156
for best writing of
a movie or miniseries?

09:35.224 --> 09:36.490
Why not?
Okay.

09:36.558 --> 09:38.892
The nominees are:

09:38.960 --> 09:41.162
Jerry Burger, Tulsa Farewell.

09:41.229 --> 09:44.998
(applause)

09:45.067 --> 09:47.935
Diane Chambers,
The Heart Held Hostage.

09:48.002 --> 09:50.804
(applause on TV)

09:50.872 --> 09:55.742
Rhonda Kizowski,
A Dream of Gladiolas.

09:55.810 --> 09:56.860
Wait.

09:56.911 --> 09:58.011
Did you hear that?

09:58.080 --> 09:59.346
Did my ears deceive me?

09:59.347 --> 10:00.815
What's the matter, Dr. Crane?

10:00.816 --> 10:02.599
Well, I thought
I heard Diane Chambers' name

10:02.600 --> 10:04.001
in that list of nominees.

10:04.069 --> 10:06.136
Robert Vanderveer
and Kenneth Montoya

10:06.204 --> 10:11.308
for Tris... Tristan and Isolde
Get a Place in Jersey.

10:11.376 --> 10:12.977
And the winner is...

10:13.044 --> 10:17.381
(drum roll)

10:17.449 --> 10:20.618
Diane Chambers,
The Heart Held Hostage.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.336
(applause on TV)

10:22.404 --> 10:24.639
(dramatic music playing)

10:24.706 --> 10:27.074
Can it be?

10:27.142 --> 10:28.609
Is it really her?

10:28.677 --> 10:30.127
Thank you all.

10:30.195 --> 10:34.865
And thank you, cable television,
for allowing those of us...

10:34.933 --> 10:39.170
who eschew the pap and pablum
of commercial television...

10:39.237 --> 10:41.872
to sing, to dance, to write

10:41.940 --> 10:45.409
and to listen
to the whispers of our muses.

10:45.476 --> 10:47.712
Although sometimes the voices of

10:47.779 --> 10:52.282
Calliope, Clio, Erato, Euterpe,

10:52.351 --> 10:58.456
Melpomene, Polyhymia,
Terpsichore, Thalia and Urania

10:58.523 --> 11:01.058
are too soft to be heard.

11:01.125 --> 11:04.161
Forgive me, gals,
if I forgot someone.

11:04.229 --> 11:06.580
God, is it her.

11:06.648 --> 11:09.800
Thanks to my parents for

11:09.868 --> 11:12.052
conceiving and bearing me.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.588
Although both wanted a boy...

11:14.656 --> 11:19.860
locked as were so many of their
generation in masculine primacy.

11:19.928 --> 11:22.430
Anyhow, where to begin?

11:22.431 --> 11:27.201
Guess we, better go tell Sammy
the romance of his life

11:27.202 --> 11:28.669
is on national TV.

11:28.670 --> 11:31.105
Yeah, well, she was once the
romance of my life, too, Norm,

11:31.106 --> 11:32.156
or are you forgetting?

11:32.157 --> 11:35.025
She dropped you
like a bad habit.

11:35.093 --> 11:36.526
Sorry I didn't bring that up.

11:39.514 --> 11:42.600
Thanks to the Amazon Rain Forest

11:42.667 --> 11:45.603
for providing me and you,
ladies and gentlemen,

11:45.670 --> 11:48.406
with 40% of our oxygen.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.408
The devastation must end!

11:50.476 --> 11:53.811
Woody, I want you to look
at the television

11:53.879 --> 11:56.246
and tell me what you see.

11:59.117 --> 12:01.218
Uh, the television
isn't even on.

12:01.286 --> 12:02.970
(sighs)

12:03.038 --> 12:07.007
(chuckling): I just must be
having one of my little spells.

12:07.075 --> 12:09.159
Thanks to you, Sylvia Plath...

12:09.227 --> 12:12.379
Whoa! This is a doozy!

12:14.148 --> 12:15.750
Let me say this,

12:15.817 --> 12:20.620
your tragic story will be
my next project.

12:20.621 --> 12:22.423
Hey Woody, lock up for me,
will you?

12:22.424 --> 12:24.124
I'm gonna take off.

12:24.192 --> 12:29.230
Oh, Lord, I tell you,
that Kim Alexis is hot.

12:29.297 --> 12:33.567
Look to her right.

12:33.635 --> 12:36.454
Thank you, Dr. Wendell Brandt...

12:36.522 --> 12:39.223
Oh, my God.

12:39.291 --> 12:42.809
For believing in and inspiring a gangly...
(orchestra playing)

12:42.877 --> 12:45.412
college freshman
in creative writing.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.932
It was Dr. Wendell Burgoyne

12:48.000 --> 12:51.668
who was my creative
writing teacher...

12:51.669 --> 12:52.970
(orchestra plays
dramatic passage)

12:52.971 --> 12:56.573
My entire script was
written on recycled paper.

12:56.641 --> 13:00.144
You have to be taught to hate.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.765
So, local girl makes good. Hmm.

13:04.833 --> 13:09.103
Ah, well, here's to Diane
and her success.

13:09.104 --> 13:10.788
Well, I'm gonna do
you one better there.

13:10.789 --> 13:14.258
I think I'm gonna send her a
telegram of congratulations.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.960
You know, it's kind of
the classy thing to do.

13:17.028 --> 13:18.663
H-H-Hold it.
Wait a minute.

13:18.730 --> 13:23.033
Why would you be sending a
telegram to my hallucination?

13:23.101 --> 13:25.303
Unless, it's not
a hallucination.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.037
What-what-what are
you talking about? The...

13:27.038 --> 13:28.706
Oh, yeah.

13:28.773 --> 13:31.726
Oh, yes. Yes, it is.

13:31.793 --> 13:35.730
As a matter of fact, this, this
whole thing is part of the hallucination.

13:35.797 --> 13:37.297
(all agreeing)

13:37.365 --> 13:41.335
Wow. I must have been
in a car accident. Mmm.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.936
I'm probably in a hospital

13:43.004 --> 13:46.423
right now, hooked up to a bunch
of machines,

13:46.491 --> 13:48.125
barely clinging to life.

13:48.193 --> 13:50.077
Yes. That's... that's
probably true.

13:50.145 --> 13:51.712
Phew. What a relief.

14:00.388 --> 14:02.740
(phone ringing)

14:06.010 --> 14:07.478
Cheers.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.263
Hello, Sam.

14:09.331 --> 14:13.000
Well, hello there.

14:13.067 --> 14:15.202
Thanks for the lovely telegram.

14:15.270 --> 14:17.171
How did you find me?

14:17.239 --> 14:20.524
Uh, Frasier, uh, you know,

14:20.592 --> 14:25.296
has a colleague who's kind of
a shrink to the stars in L.A.

14:25.363 --> 14:30.016
Oh, well, I'd hardly call
myself a star.

14:30.084 --> 14:32.269
Well, I didn't say you were.

14:32.337 --> 14:35.923
Well, I didn't say you did.

14:35.924 --> 14:38.675
Yeah, anyway, you know, he knew
somebody who knew somebody

14:38.676 --> 14:42.112
who knew somebody
who'd kind of heard of you.

14:42.180 --> 14:45.132
I'm sorry I haven't
been in touch.

14:45.199 --> 14:48.335
I've been terribly busy.

14:48.402 --> 14:51.222
Well, there's
no need to apologize.

14:51.289 --> 14:52.823
Uh, life's been great for you.

14:52.891 --> 14:54.211
It's been great for me, too.

14:54.259 --> 14:56.243
Oh really, Sam?

14:56.311 --> 14:57.978
Is life okay for you?

14:58.045 --> 14:59.846
Okay? You kidding me?

14:59.914 --> 15:01.782
Ah, it couldn't be
better, you know.

15:01.849 --> 15:04.050
Business is great,
family's great.

15:04.118 --> 15:05.952
Hair is thicker than ever.

15:10.325 --> 15:11.458
Family?

15:11.526 --> 15:12.959
You're married?

15:13.027 --> 15:16.463
Well, you didn't think I was
gonna... wait around for you

15:16.531 --> 15:18.231
for the rest of
my life, did you?

15:18.300 --> 15:20.100
I didn't say that.

15:20.168 --> 15:21.735
I didn't say you did.

15:21.803 --> 15:24.037
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Great gal.

15:24.105 --> 15:25.539
Yeah, great kids, too.

15:25.607 --> 15:28.409
You know, they sure
grow up fast, don't they?

15:28.476 --> 15:32.513
What about you, Diane,
you, you got children?

15:32.580 --> 15:34.748
I have three.

15:34.816 --> 15:36.667
Well, we have four.

15:40.054 --> 15:43.791
That's, uh, that's-that's
one more than you, I guess.

15:43.858 --> 15:46.827
Yes.

15:46.828 --> 15:48.295
Well, anyway, he's
a wonderful man.

15:48.296 --> 15:50.063
You'd like Reed.

15:50.131 --> 15:51.799
Well, if you're ever in Boston,

15:51.866 --> 15:54.601
make sure you, uh, you
bring him over to the bar.

15:54.669 --> 15:58.939
Well, you know, actually,
I have been meaning to come back to Boston.

15:59.006 --> 16:02.943
I've been invited to speak at
almost all my alma maters.

16:05.413 --> 16:09.450
I was afraid of running
into... problems.

16:09.517 --> 16:13.787
But maybe we will come back
now that we've been invited.

16:13.788 --> 16:15.622
I'll have to check
Reed's schedule.

16:15.623 --> 16:17.458
Yes. You do that.

16:17.525 --> 16:20.678
Yes, uh, sure hope
you can make it.

16:20.745 --> 16:23.597
Thank you.
I hope so, too.

16:24.766 --> 16:28.235
Well, bye, Diane.

16:28.302 --> 16:29.503
Bye.

16:34.192 --> 16:36.126
Sammy...

16:36.127 --> 16:37.545
Why did you invite her here

16:37.546 --> 16:39.346
when you're lying
about being married?

16:39.347 --> 16:41.782
You kidding me?
She'll never show up here.

16:41.850 --> 16:44.680
Besides, she's the one who's
lying about being married.

16:44.685 --> 16:46.270
How do you know?

16:46.338 --> 16:47.554
Because I know the woman.

16:47.622 --> 16:48.722
I know she's lying.

16:48.723 --> 16:50.224
Fortunately, I also
know that she knows

16:50.225 --> 16:51.591
that I know she's lying,

16:51.659 --> 16:54.394
which is why she'll never dare
show her face in Boston.

16:55.780 --> 16:58.015
She's coming.

17:04.739 --> 17:06.473
How's it going, Cliffie?

17:06.540 --> 17:08.175
Aw, I'm in no mood to talk.

17:08.242 --> 17:11.212
(cheering)

17:11.279 --> 17:15.348
Aw, guys, thanks for cheering
me up with your humour.

17:15.349 --> 17:17.434
Okay, I'll tell you
what's bothering me.

17:17.435 --> 17:18.702
Oh, please, dear God,

17:18.769 --> 17:21.503
Let this be a story
about the post office.

17:21.571 --> 17:25.191
There's this, uh, there's this
guy down at work, Marty Furman.

17:25.259 --> 17:28.028
Don't you people know
from sarcasm?

17:28.029 --> 17:30.864
There's a supervisor's position
going on in my department

17:30.865 --> 17:32.299
and Marty's the guy who, uh,

17:32.366 --> 17:34.176
is in charge
of deciding who gets it.

17:34.177 --> 17:36.403
And wouldn't you know it,
every flunky and his cousin

17:36.404 --> 17:38.438
is kissing up to him like
there's no tomorrow.

17:38.439 --> 17:41.475
Why does this bother
you so much, Cliff?

17:41.476 --> 17:43.193
Oh, because I rightfully
deserve that job,

17:43.194 --> 17:45.244
but I'm not going to
stoop to their level.

17:45.279 --> 17:46.747
No siree, Bob.

17:46.748 --> 17:49.249
Everything I've gotten in my
life I've gotten on merit.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.852
That explains
your meteoric rise.

17:54.105 --> 17:56.823
"I believe I was elected
to the city council

17:56.891 --> 17:58.725
"as an agent of change.

17:58.793 --> 18:02.196
"And I fully intend to
live up to that pledge.

18:02.263 --> 18:04.598
I will make change."

18:06.884 --> 18:09.837
No, change "change"
to "a change."

18:09.904 --> 18:11.422
What?

18:11.489 --> 18:14.291
No, see in here,
you make change.

18:14.359 --> 18:16.793
There, you make a change.

18:16.861 --> 18:18.528
So just make the change.

18:18.529 --> 18:20.230
Change, "make change"
to "make a change."

18:20.231 --> 18:22.132
Oh, just change it!

18:25.737 --> 18:30.907
Well, I think I see why
Dr. Crane never cures anybody.

18:30.975 --> 18:32.476
You know, I couldn't help

18:32.477 --> 18:34.144
but overhear your little
speech there, Wood.

18:34.145 --> 18:36.480
It was very interesting what
you said about cronyism.

18:36.481 --> 18:38.232
You're gonna have
to be strong, though.

18:38.233 --> 18:41.168
A lot of people are gonna put
a lot of pressure on you.

18:41.236 --> 18:43.403
Imagine an old pal
who's been out of work,

18:43.471 --> 18:47.141
a real good friend who
hasn't worked in years.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.643
The guy could be
fully trained as...

18:49.711 --> 18:52.679
I don't know...

18:52.747 --> 18:56.150
let's say, an accountant.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.368
But now?

18:58.436 --> 19:02.223
He spends all his
time in a bar...

19:02.290 --> 19:06.426
running up a tab that he'll
never be able to pay off.

19:06.494 --> 19:09.196
You could probably help
that poor soul, Woody.

19:09.264 --> 19:12.282
Pull a few strings
down at City Hall, get the guy a job.

19:12.350 --> 19:17.237
(sobbing):
But you... you wouldn't do that, would you?

19:17.305 --> 19:21.508
Because you're a man of honour
and principle and integrity.

19:21.576 --> 19:23.660
I'll see what I can
do, Mr. Peterson.

19:23.727 --> 19:28.314
I'll need $500
a week and a car.

19:31.887 --> 19:33.653
Did Don call?

19:33.721 --> 19:35.822
No. I'm sorry, sweetheart.

19:35.890 --> 19:39.310
What a loser I am.

19:39.377 --> 19:42.379
I'm so bad I should
form a club of losers.

19:42.380 --> 19:44.114
You know, that's something
I could win...

19:44.115 --> 19:46.016
president of the losers club.

19:46.083 --> 19:49.836
Sweetheart, you-you look
like you slept in that dress.

19:49.905 --> 19:51.105
I did.

19:51.172 --> 19:53.274
And I may wear it for
the rest of my life.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.375
Who would care?

19:54.376 --> 19:56.643
In a couple of days,
we all will.

19:58.280 --> 20:03.117
This is the dress
that I lost my guy in.

20:05.053 --> 20:08.855
If you hear a scream
and a thud...

20:08.923 --> 20:10.857
just keep drinking.

20:13.895 --> 20:16.663
I don't think I'm getting
any work out of her today.

20:16.731 --> 20:18.999
She doesn't do
anything, anyway.

20:19.067 --> 20:21.969
And she doesn't start
that until noon.

20:26.574 --> 20:28.892
Hello, everyone.

20:28.959 --> 20:31.879
(screaming)

20:37.001 --> 20:39.402
Nice to see you, too, Carla.

20:41.072 --> 20:42.639
Diane...

20:42.707 --> 20:44.074
What are you doing here?

20:44.141 --> 20:45.742
(screaming)

20:47.411 --> 20:50.497
You invited me, remember?

20:50.564 --> 20:51.615
(screaming)

20:54.151 --> 20:56.536
Carla, relax.

20:56.604 --> 20:59.272
We're just here for a visit.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.058
We?

21:01.126 --> 21:02.943
Yes, I'm with my husband, Reed.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.778
He's parking the car.

21:04.779 --> 21:07.413
I wanted to bring the children
but they're in school.

21:07.414 --> 21:09.866
Oh, great.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.602
How-how great that is.

21:11.669 --> 21:15.321
Sam, Reed and I would love
to take you to lunch.

21:15.389 --> 21:17.057
Is your wife about?

21:17.125 --> 21:19.359
Yes. Yes, she's about.

21:20.645 --> 21:25.732
Um, I'll just, uh,
get my wife, Rebecca.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.402
Yes, uh, my wife Rebecca.

21:28.469 --> 21:29.770
Excuse me, a second.

21:29.837 --> 21:31.271
Woody...

21:31.339 --> 21:34.274
One, two...

21:39.047 --> 21:41.115
Oh.

21:41.182 --> 21:44.985
Rebecca, sweetheart,
you have to be my wife.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.254
Okay.

21:47.322 --> 21:53.359
Oh, now sure, I can
say "yes" to you,

21:53.427 --> 21:57.197
because you mean about as much
to me as a rat's patootie.

21:57.198 --> 22:01.068
Listen, honey, I, I want
you to understand,

22:01.069 --> 22:02.736
see, I lied to Diane.

22:02.804 --> 22:04.734
You remember Diane?
Well, she's back.

22:04.735 --> 22:06.406
Anyway, I-I-I told her
that I was married

22:06.407 --> 22:07.808
because I knew she'd
never show up.

22:07.809 --> 22:09.209
But she's here with her husband.

22:09.210 --> 22:11.511
So, please, you got to be
my wife, just for lunch.

22:11.512 --> 22:13.180
No. I don't know, Sam.

22:13.181 --> 22:15.815
Look, please, please,
I'll owe you a big one. Please.

22:15.816 --> 22:17.784
All right.

22:17.852 --> 22:20.804
After losing the only
man I ever loved,

22:20.872 --> 22:23.439
lunch should hit the spot.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.379
Thank you.

22:28.446 --> 22:30.381
Thank you, sweetheart.

22:30.382 --> 22:31.715
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

22:31.716 --> 22:33.150
You're such a friend.

22:33.217 --> 22:34.785
And you're such a mess.

22:34.852 --> 22:38.589
Uh, tell you what, why
don't we fix you up a little

22:38.656 --> 22:42.325
then... ooh, then
we'll fix you up a lot.

22:50.235 --> 22:52.035
I'm sorry, Diane.

22:52.103 --> 22:54.604
I got a little carried
away when I first saw you.

22:54.605 --> 22:55.672
I'm all right now.

22:55.673 --> 22:56.723
Hmm.

22:57.675 --> 22:59.443
Lovely to see you.

23:00.511 --> 23:02.112
Thank you.

23:02.179 --> 23:03.980
When will you be leaving?

23:10.054 --> 23:11.755
Hello, Woody.

23:11.822 --> 23:13.389
Well, hi, Miss Chambers.

23:13.457 --> 23:15.492
What's new in your life?

23:15.560 --> 23:18.595
Oh, well, you know,
I, uh, got married,

23:18.663 --> 23:20.497
and I'm gonna have a kid.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.732
Wonderful!

23:22.800 --> 23:24.501
Yeah. Oh, also I
just got elected

23:24.569 --> 23:26.503
to the Boston City Council.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.575
How nice.

23:31.642 --> 23:35.712
And I'm next in line
for the throne of England.

23:38.683 --> 23:41.693
Really? Well, you know, maybe
we'll work together someday.

23:43.554 --> 23:46.589
You know, hammer out
a treaty or something.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.068
Hello, Diane.

23:59.637 --> 24:02.172
Hello, Frasier.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.330
You're looking well.

24:03.374 --> 24:04.741
I'm feeling well.

24:04.742 --> 24:06.676
I'm happily married
with a bright young son

24:06.677 --> 24:07.777
and a successful practice.

24:07.778 --> 24:09.329
But, you know,
what's most important...

24:09.330 --> 24:10.930
and I just realized it
this moment...

24:10.931 --> 24:13.049
is I'm over you.

24:13.117 --> 24:15.669
I'm glad.

24:15.670 --> 24:17.303
There's absolutely
nothing here anymore.

24:17.304 --> 24:18.505
I'm over you.

24:18.572 --> 24:21.407
You could be a-a total stranger
for all I'm feeling.

24:21.475 --> 24:25.245
You could be ugly and gnarled
and toothless without that

24:25.313 --> 24:28.481
shining hair,
those dancing eyes,

24:28.549 --> 24:31.034
these graceful, supple limbs.

24:31.102 --> 24:33.069
Thank God I'm free.

24:33.137 --> 24:35.772
Frasier, you're hurting me.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.108
Well, you never hurt me,
did you?!

24:41.395 --> 24:44.330
Anyway, good to see you.

24:47.434 --> 24:49.536
DIANE:
Norman, Clifford.

24:49.603 --> 24:52.355
You're exactly the way
I remember you.

24:54.692 --> 24:58.011
Well, uh, looks can be
deceiving there, Diane.

24:58.012 --> 24:59.646
I mean, our-our lives
have changed

24:59.647 --> 25:02.549
in innumerable ways.

25:02.617 --> 25:04.551
How so?

25:12.459 --> 25:14.509
Well, uh, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.600
Uh, Diane.

25:20.668 --> 25:22.302
Come on, come on, come on.

25:22.369 --> 25:25.472
Uh, Diane, I'd like you to, uh,

25:25.540 --> 25:29.476
I'd like you to meet
my wife, Rebecca.

25:29.544 --> 25:30.910
Hello, Rebecca.

25:30.978 --> 25:32.746
Hello.

25:34.815 --> 25:37.584
So...

25:37.652 --> 25:40.370
you're Mrs. Sam Malone.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.188
Uh-huh.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.058
Pretty nice, huh?

25:45.126 --> 25:46.386
And she's a real pig today

25:46.394 --> 25:49.929
compared to what she
usually looks like.

25:49.997 --> 25:52.632
Hi, honey.

25:52.700 --> 25:55.469
Hi.

25:55.536 --> 25:58.771
So, Sam, Rebecca,
this is my Reed.

25:58.839 --> 26:00.307
Reed Manchester.
Hi.

26:00.374 --> 26:01.475
Hi, Sam.

26:01.542 --> 26:02.592
How you doing?

26:02.610 --> 26:05.245
Nice to meet you.

26:06.350 --> 26:10.650
Well, awkward silences
always make me hungry.

26:10.651 --> 26:11.701
(laughs)

26:15.139 --> 26:16.723
Yeah, me, too.

26:16.791 --> 26:18.421
Why don't we, uh,
why don't we go

26:18.426 --> 26:19.993
up to Melville's for lunch?

26:20.060 --> 26:22.095
Oh, Melville's, of course.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.997
That's perfect.

26:24.064 --> 26:26.532
So, uh, Sam, Diane tells me

26:26.600 --> 26:28.835
you used to be a relief pitcher
for the Sox.

26:28.902 --> 26:30.003
Yes, that's right.

26:30.004 --> 26:32.138
So, uh, what was
your best pitch? My best pitch.

26:32.139 --> 26:34.975
Uh, gee, that'd be, uh,
"Say baby, what's your sign?"

26:35.042 --> 26:36.108
(chuckles)

26:38.879 --> 26:42.916
That, uh, Miss Chambers' husband
seemed like a nice guy.

26:42.984 --> 26:44.918
She'll make him pay for it.

26:47.789 --> 26:49.659
If she's left him
a shred of manhood,

26:49.660 --> 26:51.792
it's only because she's
waiting for the right moment

26:51.793 --> 26:55.128
to-to flick it
away like the last

26:55.196 --> 26:58.731
shrivelled pea on her plate.

26:58.800 --> 27:02.402
Thank God I'm over her.

27:02.469 --> 27:03.837
Hit me, Woody!

27:03.905 --> 27:06.306
Four fingers of the
meanest swill you got!

27:10.377 --> 27:14.647
And all my life, I've wanted
to be a documentary film maker.

27:14.715 --> 27:16.649
That certainly is interesting.

27:19.286 --> 27:21.320
So, Rebecca, tell us
about yourself.

27:21.388 --> 27:24.156
Sam never mentioned
what you do.

27:24.224 --> 27:25.925
He didn't?

27:25.993 --> 27:28.961
Well, it never came up.

27:29.029 --> 27:30.763
Well, uh...
(clears throat)

27:30.831 --> 27:34.401
I am a... corporate
attorney...

27:36.754 --> 27:39.923
with the firm Emerson...

27:39.991 --> 27:42.458
Lake and Palmer.

27:45.278 --> 27:46.712
That sounds familiar.

27:46.713 --> 27:48.231
Yeah, they're a
pretty famous group.

27:48.232 --> 27:49.399
Listen, um...

27:51.118 --> 27:53.853
And what I specialize
in there is, uh,

27:53.921 --> 27:56.556
is product liability cases.

27:56.624 --> 27:59.091
That was good.

27:59.159 --> 28:00.426
I mean, is good.

28:00.494 --> 28:02.495
Because, uh,
it's a good job she has.

28:02.563 --> 28:03.696
Oh, yeah.

28:03.764 --> 28:05.815
And you still find time

28:05.883 --> 28:07.984
to raise four small children?

28:08.052 --> 28:11.487
Oh, they're not so small.

28:11.555 --> 28:14.691
Uh, Sam Junior is, uh, five.

28:14.759 --> 28:17.794
And, um, then Darby's four.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.379
And, uh, Newton's three.

28:20.447 --> 28:22.749
And then, uh,

28:22.817 --> 28:26.019
little two-year-old
Chelsea, she's one.

28:30.273 --> 28:33.426
Well, here's to
marriage and children

28:33.494 --> 28:35.695
and the dawn of
a great new friendship.

28:35.763 --> 28:36.829
Aw.

28:36.898 --> 28:37.998
(sobs loudly)

28:38.065 --> 28:40.000
(sobbing):
Don!

28:42.803 --> 28:45.571
Why did you have
to mention Don?

28:45.639 --> 28:46.756
(sobbing)

28:46.824 --> 28:48.942
She-she's, uh,
she's very sentimental.

28:49.010 --> 28:51.611
You see, we, uh,
we-we met at dawn,

28:51.678 --> 28:54.346
and it's her, uh,
favourite time of day.

28:54.414 --> 28:56.316
Come on, sweetheart.

28:56.384 --> 28:58.484
Sit up there
and dry those tears of joy.

28:58.552 --> 28:59.652
(sobbing)

29:01.605 --> 29:03.990
Rebecca.

29:04.058 --> 29:05.458
I got to talk to you.

29:05.525 --> 29:06.726
I've been up

29:06.727 --> 29:08.094
all night thinking about this,

29:08.095 --> 29:10.096
and I'm miserable without you.

29:10.164 --> 29:11.530
You got to marry me!

29:13.350 --> 29:14.400
You got to marry me,

29:14.468 --> 29:16.870
and this time I won't
take no for an answer.

29:16.937 --> 29:17.987
I love you.

29:18.005 --> 29:19.055
Hi, Sam.

29:19.073 --> 29:20.924
How you doing?

29:23.160 --> 29:24.928
Huh?

29:24.995 --> 29:26.095
I will marry you!

29:26.163 --> 29:27.296
(laughing)

29:27.364 --> 29:28.982
(Rebecca shrieks)

29:29.049 --> 29:32.102
I said yes!
I did it!

29:32.169 --> 29:35.238
Oh, Don, thank God
you came back for me!

29:35.305 --> 29:36.806
(moaning)

29:41.729 --> 29:43.359
Oh, Sam,
you don't mind, do you?

29:43.396 --> 29:45.165
No.

29:50.171 --> 29:52.088
Oh, uh, uh,
have a good day, Sam.

29:52.155 --> 29:53.322
SAM:
You, too.

29:56.827 --> 29:58.995
She's interesting.

30:04.417 --> 30:06.119
All right, all right,
I admit it.

30:06.187 --> 30:07.453
I'm not married; I lied.

30:07.454 --> 30:09.722
I don't know why I did it;
It was a stupid thing.

30:09.723 --> 30:11.841
Well, Sam, you'll find
someone eventually.

30:11.842 --> 30:13.042
SAM:
No, don't do that.

30:13.110 --> 30:15.040
Don't-don't-don't feel
sorry for me.

30:15.041 --> 30:16.396
I hate that worse than anything.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.447
REED:
Listen, Sam,

30:17.498 --> 30:20.216
Diane told me
about your past together.

30:20.284 --> 30:23.320
Maybe this...
public humiliation

30:23.321 --> 30:24.854
is the clean break you needed.

30:24.855 --> 30:28.074
Maybe now you can get on
with your life.

30:29.059 --> 30:31.877
Aw, you see why I love him?

30:31.945 --> 30:34.314
Okay, you want to tell me

30:34.315 --> 30:36.182
just what the hell
this is all about?

30:36.183 --> 30:38.802
Who are you?

30:38.869 --> 30:41.805
He's, uh, he's a friend.

30:41.872 --> 30:44.307
Oh, now I'm a friend.

30:44.374 --> 30:45.909
Gee, I'm honoured.

30:45.976 --> 30:47.177
Tell me, friend,

30:47.178 --> 30:49.012
why did you leave our
place in Malibu yesterday

30:49.013 --> 30:50.579
without so much as a
word of explanation?

30:50.580 --> 30:52.282
You made me track you
down across country

30:52.283 --> 30:53.749
just like some
sort of a gumshoe.

30:53.750 --> 30:56.952
After seven years together,
I think I deserve better.

30:59.290 --> 31:02.442
Is he the reason
you left me, Reed?!

31:03.877 --> 31:05.611
(chuckling):
God, no!

31:05.679 --> 31:07.429
Look, I-I'm just,

31:07.497 --> 31:10.166
I'm just doing
a favour for Diane.

31:10.167 --> 31:12.268
Okay, you're very good
at explaining things.

31:12.269 --> 31:13.469
Only this time,

31:13.470 --> 31:15.004
you're not quite
good enough. Well, wait!

31:15.005 --> 31:17.640
Please, Kevin wait!

31:17.641 --> 31:18.741
I was...

31:18.742 --> 31:20.743
I-I'm sorry, Diane.

31:20.811 --> 31:22.912
Muffin, come back!

31:37.177 --> 31:39.011
So then what happened?

31:39.079 --> 31:41.764
So the next thing we know,
Diane turns up here

31:41.832 --> 31:44.767
with her husband
and asks to meet Sam's wife.

31:44.835 --> 31:46.336
Holy moly.
CLIFF: Yeah, yeah.

31:46.337 --> 31:48.371
Then Sam goes back there
and grabs our fair Rebecca,

31:48.372 --> 31:50.106
introduces her
as Mrs. Malone,

31:50.107 --> 31:52.675
then they toddle on up there
to, uh, Melville's for lunch.

31:52.676 --> 31:53.993
Man, oh, man, oh, man.

31:53.994 --> 31:55.495
Which ought to be
very interesting

31:55.496 --> 31:57.129
because Rebecca's been
a total gibbering idiot

31:57.130 --> 31:58.460
ever since Don dumped her.

31:58.465 --> 32:01.434
Damn it all.

32:01.502 --> 32:03.703
Everything neat happens

32:03.771 --> 32:05.354
when I'm not here!

32:05.422 --> 32:08.958
I always miss everything!

32:09.026 --> 32:10.126
Yeah.

32:10.194 --> 32:11.861
Oh, Don!

32:11.929 --> 32:13.963
You put me down,
you big crazy thing!

32:13.964 --> 32:15.699
You're gonna throw out
your big muscular back!

32:15.700 --> 32:18.134
Oh, I'm never letting
you go again, Rebecca.

32:18.202 --> 32:19.252
Oh, Woody,

32:19.269 --> 32:22.171
Rebecca will be gone
the rest of the evening,

32:22.239 --> 32:25.008
and I hope you can do
without her because I can't.

32:25.009 --> 32:27.576
We're going out to make love
in the, uh, swan boats

32:27.577 --> 32:29.012
in the public gardens.

32:29.079 --> 32:31.881
Couldn't you just eat us alive?

32:34.084 --> 32:35.885
REED:
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin!

32:35.952 --> 32:38.154
I was pretending to
be Diane's husband

32:38.222 --> 32:39.552
to fool her old boyfriend.

32:39.553 --> 32:41.757
She's helping me write a
Tales From the Crypt!

32:41.758 --> 32:43.026
It's that simple!

32:43.093 --> 32:44.794
Very imaginative story.

32:44.862 --> 32:46.963
Reed, I put up
with your astronaut,

32:46.964 --> 32:49.331
your anchorman
and your all-pro quarterback!

32:49.332 --> 32:50.833
But this is it.
I'm leaving.

32:50.901 --> 32:54.554
Please! You can just give me
one last chance!

33:02.296 --> 33:03.897
I missed something, didn't I?

33:07.885 --> 33:10.753
We're pathetic.

33:10.821 --> 33:13.823
How so?

33:13.891 --> 33:18.761
Sam, you just spent
the afternoon pretending

33:18.829 --> 33:22.232
to be married to a woman
who's the emotional equivalent

33:22.299 --> 33:26.536
of Mr. Toad's
Wild Ride...

33:26.603 --> 33:29.472
and who's desperately in love
with another man.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.142
Yeah, well at least
I didn't fly across the country

33:32.209 --> 33:34.610
to make an ass out of myself.

33:34.678 --> 33:40.350
Why bother when you do it
so brilliantly right here?

33:40.418 --> 33:43.452
The only reason why I went
through all of this

33:43.520 --> 33:45.621
is so you wouldn't get
the wrong idea.

33:45.689 --> 33:47.340
And what idea was that?

33:47.407 --> 33:48.975
That my life was empty.

33:49.043 --> 33:52.578
That without you I'm lost and
alone with nothing to live for.

33:52.579 --> 33:54.513
I mean, that's why you came
here, right,

33:54.514 --> 33:55.748
to see something like that?

33:55.749 --> 34:00.002
I came back on a quest
for the truth.

34:00.070 --> 34:02.121
Ah. And you just
brought along

34:02.188 --> 34:04.524
your one-man Warren
Commission there, huh?

34:06.827 --> 34:08.327
You want the truth?

34:08.395 --> 34:10.324
You know, I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

34:10.330 --> 34:13.733
My, my life is so full
it's, it's unbelievable.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.484
Well, tell me about it.

34:15.552 --> 34:16.601
Oh, no, no, no, no.

34:16.620 --> 34:17.770
I'm sorry, sister.

34:17.771 --> 34:19.538
You don't walk out of here
for six years

34:19.539 --> 34:22.074
and then waltz back in and
expect to hear my story.

34:22.141 --> 34:24.376
You know, I don't,
I don't tell about

34:24.444 --> 34:27.996
my very rich and-and full life
with just anybody, you know?

34:28.063 --> 34:31.301
That's exactly as I feared.

34:31.302 --> 34:32.969
You're angry at me
for leaving you.

34:32.969 --> 34:35.170
I don't have time
to be angry, honey.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.440
I... too much to do.

34:37.507 --> 34:40.743
When I went away
to finish my novel,

34:40.811 --> 34:43.712
I promised to come back
to you in six months.

34:43.780 --> 34:45.348
And I meant to.

34:45.416 --> 34:50.219
But... well...

34:50.286 --> 34:51.786
once the book was finished,

34:51.855 --> 34:53.956
the publishers didn't want it.

34:54.024 --> 34:57.092
I never figured out
why exactly.

34:57.161 --> 34:59.912
But then my agent

34:59.980 --> 35:03.799
suggested that I trim
a couple of thousand pages...

35:06.170 --> 35:09.922
and make it a screenplay.

35:09.990 --> 35:12.475
Could we hurry
this along, please?

35:12.543 --> 35:14.777
You know, my, my
schedule's a real bear.

35:16.814 --> 35:21.651
I didn't want to come back
until I was successful, Sam.

35:23.904 --> 35:28.374
But six months became a year...

35:28.442 --> 35:32.078
and by then I'd waited too long.

35:37.868 --> 35:40.569
Oh, what are we doing?

35:40.637 --> 35:44.173
This is for the best.

35:44.241 --> 35:47.710
I mean, y-you and I
just don't work together.

35:47.777 --> 35:52.014
Yeah, we had great
sex, you know?

35:52.082 --> 35:54.383
A couple times there, we had

35:54.451 --> 35:57.320
to perform CPR on each other.

35:57.387 --> 35:59.197
But, uh, you know,
other than that,

35:59.223 --> 36:02.725
we're a total mismatch.

36:02.793 --> 36:05.961
I think we proved that
again today, don't you?

36:09.633 --> 36:11.668
I guess we did.

36:13.887 --> 36:17.506
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't have a full life.

36:19.893 --> 36:23.195
I have my career,
some associates,

36:23.263 --> 36:29.234
no family, a few friends,

36:29.302 --> 36:30.970
and of course my muse.

36:33.390 --> 36:35.975
Even Reed is just
my dog groomer.

36:39.296 --> 36:41.598
Sometimes I feel
a little lonely,

36:41.665 --> 36:45.201
but that's the life
I chose for myself.

36:49.172 --> 36:51.674
So...

36:51.742 --> 36:53.175
good-bye, Sam.

36:53.244 --> 36:54.510
Yeah.

36:56.447 --> 36:58.381
Oh, this is silly.

37:02.002 --> 37:03.419
Bye.

37:04.067 --> 37:08.424
Oh, wait-wait-wait,
hold on a second. Listen.

37:08.425 --> 37:10.409
Before you run out of here,

37:10.477 --> 37:13.012
can you do me one
little favour, please?

37:13.080 --> 37:16.632
This isn't what you used
to mean by favour, is it?

37:16.633 --> 37:17.833
Come here. Come on.
Sit down.

37:17.834 --> 37:19.368
Please.

37:19.436 --> 37:23.122
You know, it's just
that they, uh, they have

37:23.123 --> 37:24.390
this great dessert here,

37:24.391 --> 37:28.961
but you have
to order it for two.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.163
What kind of dessert is it?

37:31.231 --> 37:35.701
Well, they start
with ice cream.

37:35.769 --> 37:38.070
I love ice cream.

37:38.138 --> 37:40.356
Oh, no, but this is
the best ice cream.

37:40.423 --> 37:44.226
It's sweet, rich, creamy.

37:46.847 --> 37:49.181
What do they do to it?

37:49.249 --> 37:53.936
Cover it with lots and lots of
thick raspberry sauce all over.

37:55.755 --> 37:57.390
All over?

37:57.458 --> 37:59.808
They can't stop themselves.

38:01.611 --> 38:04.613
Sounds so sinful.

38:04.681 --> 38:07.283
There's more.

38:07.351 --> 38:10.986
More?
What more could they do?

38:11.054 --> 38:14.307
Well, they heat up
the raspberry sauce.

38:14.374 --> 38:18.110
How hot do they get it?

38:18.178 --> 38:21.196
How hot would you like it?

38:21.197 --> 38:22.898
Can I interest
you folks in dessert?

38:22.899 --> 38:24.066
Just the check, please.

38:24.134 --> 38:25.801
Quickly.

38:31.208 --> 38:32.542
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:32.609 --> 38:35.712
our new City Councilman,
Woody Boyd.

38:35.779 --> 38:37.930
(whistles)

38:39.649 --> 38:40.816
Thank you.

38:40.884 --> 38:42.985
You know, I want you all
to know that

38:43.052 --> 38:44.742
at City Hall I may be
councilman,

38:44.788 --> 38:46.906
but around here
I'm just your old pal,

38:46.973 --> 38:49.642
the Honourable Mr. Boyd.

38:49.709 --> 38:51.744
(laughing):
That's very funny, Woody.

38:51.745 --> 38:53.412
Of course, we all know
you're joking.

38:53.413 --> 38:54.614
But the truth be told,

38:54.681 --> 38:56.115
you know we all see you

38:56.183 --> 38:58.083
in a, well,
a different light now.

38:58.084 --> 38:59.585
You've taken on
a certain dignity

38:59.586 --> 39:01.053
and weight with this office,

39:01.054 --> 39:02.838
and you will be
treated accordingly.

39:02.839 --> 39:04.473
Well, thank you, Dr. Crane.
Hey!

39:04.541 --> 39:06.876
Lonesome Cowpie,
I'm dry over here!

39:06.944 --> 39:08.544
Right away, sir.

39:10.113 --> 39:12.764
Well, Kelly, you
must be very proud of your husband.

39:12.832 --> 39:15.367
Oh, yes, I certainly am,
Dr. Crane. Yes.

39:15.368 --> 39:17.703
You know, the city of Boston
has lots of problems.

39:17.704 --> 39:18.704
Oh.

39:18.705 --> 39:20.239
I can't imagine
what they might be,

39:20.240 --> 39:23.175
but I know Woody is the man
to solve them.

39:25.028 --> 39:26.629
I hope you're right.

39:26.697 --> 39:29.515
After all, we have
to make the town a safe place

39:29.583 --> 39:32.218
for little Woody Jr.
To be driven through

39:32.286 --> 39:34.620
on his way to private school.

39:36.122 --> 39:39.559
An inspiring thought.

39:39.626 --> 39:41.226
Yes, sir, I will.

39:41.294 --> 39:42.804
I-I'll see you
in the morning.

39:42.805 --> 39:44.530
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.

39:44.531 --> 39:48.384
Well, everybody,
congratulate me.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.887
I am now employed by
the City of Boston.

39:50.954 --> 39:52.588
ALL:
Hey!

39:52.656 --> 39:54.790
And I have this man
to thank for it.

39:54.858 --> 39:56.759
Oh, hey, no problem,
Mr. Peterson.

39:56.827 --> 39:59.095
I know you're gonna work
very hard.

39:59.163 --> 40:00.362
Yeah, of course, Wood.

40:00.430 --> 40:02.831
Hey, this kind of makes you
my boss, huh?

40:02.899 --> 40:04.133
Oh, yeah, in a way,

40:04.201 --> 40:06.568
but you know, deep down
and above all,

40:06.569 --> 40:08.905
and through everything else,
we're friends.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.106
Oh, of course.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.607
No man ever had a better one.

40:11.675 --> 40:12.875
I feel the same way.

40:12.943 --> 40:15.011
Pals.
Compadres.

40:15.078 --> 40:16.245
I may be late tomorrow.

40:16.313 --> 40:18.431
I wouldn't recommend it,
Peterson.

40:23.687 --> 40:25.254
Hey, everybody, guess what.

40:25.322 --> 40:28.424
We got married!

40:28.492 --> 40:29.775
ALL:
Hey!

40:34.097 --> 40:36.248
We just ran off
to the Justice of the Peace

40:36.316 --> 40:38.550
before we could change
our minds.

40:38.618 --> 40:40.852
We're a little bit crazy,
aren't we?

40:40.921 --> 40:43.488
She's a whole lot crazy,
and I'm not at all.

40:43.556 --> 40:45.690
That averages out
to just a little.

40:45.758 --> 40:48.027
Well done, Don!

40:48.028 --> 40:49.895
You, you grabbed yourself
a real, a really,

40:49.896 --> 40:52.464
a totally... Well,
you got Rebecca!

40:54.684 --> 40:56.218
Say, Don, here, have a seat.

40:56.286 --> 40:57.753
Let me get you a drink, huh?

40:57.821 --> 40:58.988
Thanks, Doc.

40:58.989 --> 41:00.489
Oh, sweetheart, I'll just
be over here.

41:00.490 --> 41:01.524
Okay, hubby.

41:01.525 --> 41:04.326
Don't you stop loving me!

41:06.246 --> 41:09.348
(sobbing):
I married a plumber!

41:17.941 --> 41:19.575
Oh, God!

41:19.643 --> 41:22.611
I'm the wife of a plumber!

41:22.679 --> 41:26.615
We're gonna have a whole bunch
of little plumbers.

41:26.683 --> 41:30.586
And the horrible part of it is
that he's too good for me.

41:31.924 --> 41:34.022
Gee, Miss Howe,

41:34.023 --> 41:36.058
I mean, Mrs. Sandtry,
I, uh...

41:36.125 --> 41:39.161
And my name's
Mrs. Sandtry!

41:43.099 --> 41:46.519
Well, I think Don's gonna make
a great husband.

41:46.586 --> 41:50.889
Well, of course, he is, Woody.

41:50.957 --> 41:53.859
I just have a little case
of the wedding day jitters.

41:53.927 --> 41:57.763
And I know I love Don
with all my heart.

41:57.831 --> 42:01.099
And until he finds out
how screwed up I am and he dumps me,

42:01.167 --> 42:03.536
we are gonna have the most
wonderful marriage.

42:05.522 --> 42:08.758
Hear-hear, huh?

42:08.825 --> 42:11.443
Say good-bye
to the old Cliff Clavin.

42:11.511 --> 42:12.844
ALL:
Good-bye!

42:14.364 --> 42:16.381
Say hello
to the new Cliff Clavin,

42:16.449 --> 42:21.553
the new assistant supervisor
of sub-district A, grid L.

42:21.621 --> 42:23.672
ALL:
Good-bye!

42:25.125 --> 42:27.325
This, I'm here for.

42:32.051 --> 42:36.535
Well, Cliffie, I guess
buying all those gifts

42:36.536 --> 42:37.837
really paid off, huh?

42:37.838 --> 42:40.239
Yeah, yeah, Norm.
You know, I was forced into it.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.050
I mean, everybody else
was doing it.

42:42.051 --> 42:43.509
But there's no shame
in kissing up

42:43.510 --> 42:45.477
as long as it's
a honest display of affection

42:45.478 --> 42:47.613
for those in authority.

42:47.614 --> 42:50.082
You know, I guess the box
of steaks and a ham radio

42:50.083 --> 42:53.152
is really a small price
to pay for this kind of advancement.

42:53.220 --> 42:55.954
Yeah, well, I had to
up the ante a bit.

42:56.023 --> 42:59.058
Yeah, I'm, uh, putting
on a family room on his house.

43:01.828 --> 43:04.296
But I can hold my head up high.

43:04.364 --> 43:06.932
You see, he's got
to furnish it himself.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.736
Yeah, you see, once
that pool table is delivered, I'm out.

43:10.803 --> 43:13.905
Hey, wait a minute,
where's Sammy?

43:13.973 --> 43:16.275
Hey, Woody, was he
at the swearing in?

43:16.342 --> 43:17.459
I didn't see him.

43:17.527 --> 43:20.412
Oh, no!

43:20.480 --> 43:23.782
Has anyone seen Sam since
yesterday

43:23.849 --> 43:27.803
when he was upstairs
with Miss Robin Deadbreast?

43:29.572 --> 43:32.524
Oh, no! Man, I slipped up!

43:32.592 --> 43:35.227
I let down my guard!

43:35.228 --> 43:37.062
Anything that happens now
is my fault.

43:37.063 --> 43:38.297
What was I thinking?!

43:38.364 --> 43:40.432
Well, Carla,
for God's sakes, relax!

43:40.499 --> 43:42.567
I mean, just look around you.

43:42.635 --> 43:44.870
Woody's got a new position.
Norm's got a job.

43:44.938 --> 43:46.271
Cliff's got a promotion.

43:46.339 --> 43:48.774
Rebecca's got a husband!

43:48.842 --> 43:51.492
I mean, this is the best day
in the history of Cheers!

43:51.527 --> 43:52.978
Nothing could go wrong today.

43:53.046 --> 43:54.780
Hey, everybody.

43:56.333 --> 43:59.468
Diane and I are together again.

44:01.621 --> 44:03.456
Did you hear what I said?

44:03.523 --> 44:05.524
I said, we're a,
we're a couple.

44:05.592 --> 44:08.661
As a matter of fact we're,
uh, we're getting married.

44:15.451 --> 44:17.719
Congratulations.

44:26.697 --> 44:29.264
Fellas, I just said
we're getting married.

44:29.399 --> 44:32.767
I think a little reaction's
in order, don't you think?

44:32.836 --> 44:34.302
I knew it.

44:34.370 --> 44:36.238
I knew it the minute-
the second...

44:36.305 --> 44:38.607
I laid eyes on her,
all those years ago,

44:38.675 --> 44:40.842
that it was the worst
moment of my life.

44:40.911 --> 44:44.579
I knew that she was gonna ruin
everything someday!

44:44.647 --> 44:46.214
This is it.

44:46.215 --> 44:48.984
Hey, Carla, don't you think
it's time to give that up?

44:48.985 --> 44:50.419
Never.

44:50.487 --> 44:52.053
Carla...

44:52.089 --> 44:55.523
I wasn't going to tell you this,
but maybe you should hear it.

44:55.591 --> 45:01.563
The screenplay for which I was
so extravagantly honoured

45:01.631 --> 45:04.199
was based on your life.

45:06.336 --> 45:08.971
You were my inspiration.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.206
Really?

45:10.273 --> 45:11.973
Yes.

45:12.042 --> 45:16.979
It's the story of a resilient,
hard working mother,

45:17.047 --> 45:20.148
bucking all odds
to raise her six children.

45:20.217 --> 45:21.751
Six?

45:21.818 --> 45:23.218
I got eight.

45:23.253 --> 45:27.455
Good God!
You breed like a fly!

45:28.825 --> 45:31.793
Well, uh, this movie-
people liked it?

45:31.862 --> 45:33.863
They loved it, Carla.

45:33.930 --> 45:37.066
People were inspired by
the plight of my heroine.

45:37.133 --> 45:38.367
Yeah?

45:38.434 --> 45:39.768
Well, what happens to me?

45:39.836 --> 45:42.371
I mean, you know,
to her, in the end.

45:42.438 --> 45:45.507
Well... out of the despair
and frustration

45:45.575 --> 45:47.142
of her unmanageable life,

45:47.210 --> 45:49.511
she goes berserk...

45:49.546 --> 45:51.714
and...

45:51.781 --> 45:54.082
takes out a few people
with an Uzi.

45:56.186 --> 45:59.287
That cost me
the Humanitas Award.

45:59.355 --> 46:01.056
Diane...

46:01.124 --> 46:04.627
you know, I've said a lot of
horrible and hateful things

46:04.694 --> 46:06.394
to you over the years...

46:06.463 --> 46:10.465
Well, if I said
something nice now,

46:10.533 --> 46:13.134
would you get all yucky?

46:13.203 --> 46:16.171
You have my word I won't.

46:18.375 --> 46:21.576
Well... Diane, I...

46:22.846 --> 46:23.896
Nah.

46:25.849 --> 46:28.050
Life's too short.

46:31.254 --> 46:33.122
FRASIER:
So, Sam, uh,

46:33.190 --> 46:34.957
you and Diane
are back together,

46:35.024 --> 46:38.126
just like that, after
six years of separation.

46:38.194 --> 46:45.668
Six years of growing and
evolving and self-discovery,

46:45.735 --> 46:47.365
deciding what we want from life

46:47.366 --> 46:49.071
and realizing that
we don't have it.

46:49.072 --> 46:50.372
SAM:
Yeah, besides, uh,

46:50.373 --> 46:51.940
last night, we both discovered

46:51.941 --> 46:55.844
we still like...
the same desserts.

46:55.845 --> 46:58.980
Yeah, anyway, what the hell,
you know?

46:58.981 --> 47:00.849
I've always wanted
to live in California.

47:00.850 --> 47:02.885
(murmurs of surprise and shock)

47:02.952 --> 47:05.153
You leaving us, Sam?

47:05.222 --> 47:06.588
Well, yeah, Woody.

47:06.656 --> 47:08.490
Yeah, I am.
You know?

47:08.558 --> 47:10.859
It's time for me
to move on, you know?

47:10.927 --> 47:14.295
Face new challenges and-and
Diane said she'd get me a job

47:14.363 --> 47:16.765
at the juice bar
in her health club.

47:16.766 --> 47:20.702
FRASIER: Well, I had no idea
you had such exciting prospects.

47:20.703 --> 47:22.093
By all means go for it, Sam!

47:22.105 --> 47:23.572
Here's kiwi in your eye!

47:27.277 --> 47:29.645
NORM:
Sammy... California?!

47:29.712 --> 47:32.882
Riots, smog, earthquakes?

47:32.949 --> 47:34.149
Don't make me laugh, now.

47:34.150 --> 47:35.884
There's no earthquakes
in California.

47:35.885 --> 47:38.020
There aren't?
No, there's never been any!

47:38.021 --> 47:40.522
See, what they tell us are
earthquakes are actually

47:40.523 --> 47:43.113
sonic booms caused by
a project that's been funded

47:43.126 --> 47:44.793
by the U.S. government.

47:44.861 --> 47:49.230
You see, what they're doing is
they're creating a huge cavity...

47:49.231 --> 47:51.767
a tunnel, if you will- right
to the centre of the Earth,

47:51.768 --> 47:53.535
where they're gonna
build a giant computer

47:53.536 --> 47:56.204
to control
the planet's rotation.

47:58.541 --> 48:01.677
Can I... can I be the only one
that's heard of this?

48:04.914 --> 48:09.418
You know, Cliff, electro-shock
therapy only sounds scary.

48:10.686 --> 48:12.376
Let me bring in
a colour brochure.

48:12.388 --> 48:14.823
It features Babar.

48:14.891 --> 48:17.025
Uh, can I get one?

48:19.496 --> 48:21.229
I'll bring in a boxful!

48:22.365 --> 48:24.632
Can we just get back
on the subject here?

48:24.700 --> 48:27.803
Sam is leaving us, okay?

48:27.804 --> 48:30.639
WOODY: So, uh, Sam, what are you
gonna do about the bar?

48:30.640 --> 48:33.174
Well, I thought I'd let Rebecca
run it for a while,

48:33.242 --> 48:36.012
then, afterwards, I'll sell
what's left for kindling.

48:36.879 --> 48:38.280
SAM:
Aw, come on, you guys!

48:38.348 --> 48:39.931
Lighten up, man.
That's a joke.

48:39.999 --> 48:42.534
FRASIER:
Sam, can I ask you a question?

48:42.602 --> 48:46.588
And I mean this as a caring,
supportive friend.

48:46.656 --> 48:49.291
Have you lost your
freaking mind?!

48:49.359 --> 48:51.243
What are you talking about?

48:51.244 --> 48:53.612
The two of you had a
relationship whose best moments

48:53.613 --> 48:55.748
were full of anguish
and self-loathing.

48:55.815 --> 48:57.933
After ten hours
with this woman,

48:57.934 --> 48:59.752
you want to give up
your life, your livelihood,

48:59.753 --> 49:02.087
and move with her
to California?!

49:02.154 --> 49:05.207
Hey, you want to get
off my case, fellas?

49:05.274 --> 49:07.309
You know,
I think you're turning on me

49:07.377 --> 49:09.644
'cause I just want to get
my life going here.

49:09.712 --> 49:12.080
I mean, look at me:
What've I got?

49:12.148 --> 49:15.884
No family, no future,
nothing to look forward to.

49:15.951 --> 49:17.686
CARLA:
Sammy...

49:17.687 --> 49:19.287
I can't believe
this is happening.

49:19.288 --> 49:21.089
Yeah, I can't either, Carla.

49:21.090 --> 49:23.792
Yeah, after all the
cheer leading I've done for you guys,

49:23.793 --> 49:26.361
even when I knew you
were making mistakes.

49:26.362 --> 49:28.130
Oh, so you want us
to return the favour?

49:28.131 --> 49:30.082
Yes, yes, I do...

49:30.149 --> 49:31.950
And I'm not making a mistake.

49:32.017 --> 49:33.285
NORM:
Sammy...

49:33.352 --> 49:35.520
what's gonna happen to us?

49:40.893 --> 49:42.628
Come on, you guys.

49:42.695 --> 49:44.062
I mean, all you fellas do

49:44.097 --> 49:46.698
is just sit there
and watch the world go by.

49:46.766 --> 49:48.800
You don't need me for that.

49:48.868 --> 49:51.069
I want to get off the bench,
you know?

49:51.137 --> 49:53.605
I want to get in the game.

49:53.673 --> 49:56.808
So, you just gonna desert us?

49:56.875 --> 49:59.578
You gonna just walk out,
like a traitor?

49:59.646 --> 50:01.913
A traitor?

50:01.981 --> 50:03.314
I need more than this!

50:03.382 --> 50:05.984
You know, you should
need more than this!

50:06.052 --> 50:07.686
I am not your mother!

50:07.754 --> 50:10.388
This is not your home!

50:13.777 --> 50:15.460
This is ridiculous.

50:15.461 --> 50:17.629
Come on, let's just
get out of here, you know?

50:17.630 --> 50:18.997
We got a plane to catch.

50:18.998 --> 50:21.166
Thank you very much for
all your best wishes, fellas,

50:21.167 --> 50:23.652
and for making it clear
that I'm doing the right thing.

50:23.653 --> 50:25.320
Come on, sweetheart.

50:27.039 --> 50:29.107
I'm sorry, everyone.

50:31.444 --> 50:34.346
This is the best for Sam,
believe me.

50:38.284 --> 50:40.168
(door shuts)

50:40.236 --> 50:43.572
I gave that man the
best years of my life.

50:48.795 --> 50:50.662
CLIFF:
Yeah...

50:50.730 --> 50:53.298
We'll get along without him.

50:54.567 --> 50:57.002
Sure...

50:57.069 --> 50:59.104
life goes on.

51:05.111 --> 51:07.746
Oh, Sam, you're not
still thinking about

51:07.747 --> 51:09.982
what those people said
at the bar, are you?

51:09.983 --> 51:12.751
No, don't be silly.
Furthest thing from my mind.

51:12.819 --> 51:14.920
It does bug you,
though, doesn't it?

51:14.921 --> 51:17.238
The way they thought we didn't
know what we were doing?

51:17.239 --> 51:19.274
I mean, we know, right?

51:19.342 --> 51:20.909
Damn right we know!

51:20.910 --> 51:22.543
CAPTAIN (over P.A.):
Evening, folks.

51:22.544 --> 51:23.928
This is Captain McGovern.

51:23.929 --> 51:25.764
I'm gonna ask
the flight attendants

51:25.765 --> 51:28.367
to prepare for departure now,
if they would, please.

51:28.368 --> 51:30.602
And as soon as
we get clearance from the tower,

51:30.603 --> 51:32.070
we'll be taking off.

51:32.137 --> 51:33.672
Oh, Sam...

51:35.241 --> 51:37.342
In a moment,
we'll be off. Mm.

51:37.343 --> 51:39.644
Isn't this the perfect
beginning for our lives together?

51:39.645 --> 51:41.679
Taking flight.

51:41.748 --> 51:44.783
Speeding down the
runway side by side,

51:44.851 --> 51:47.385
until we lift from the ground,

51:47.453 --> 51:51.723
leaving far beneath us
the tedium of ordinary life,

51:51.791 --> 51:55.427
to soar into the bright,
unlimited future.

51:55.494 --> 51:59.897
You ever hear
of the Mile-High Club?

52:02.735 --> 52:05.136
Oh, Sam, naughty-naughty.

52:05.204 --> 52:07.339
They give you
bonus points for it.

52:07.340 --> 52:11.076
CAPTAIN (over P.A.):
Folks, this is your captain again.

52:11.077 --> 52:12.711
Sorry,
but we're gonna be delayed

52:12.712 --> 52:14.746
here on the tarmac for a bit.

52:14.747 --> 52:17.649
We're having a minor problem
with our electrical system,

52:17.650 --> 52:20.485
and we'll need some time
to check it out.

52:20.552 --> 52:24.306
By the way, Sam, you might want
to take advantage of this delay

52:24.373 --> 52:27.309
to reconsider
what you're doing.

52:29.645 --> 52:31.813
Are you really in love
with this woman

52:31.814 --> 52:34.449
or are you trying to love her
because you're afraid

52:34.450 --> 52:35.850
of ending up alone?

52:35.918 --> 52:37.652
Think about it.

52:45.244 --> 52:46.878
Did you just hear that?

52:46.945 --> 52:48.880
What?

52:48.947 --> 52:51.215
What the captain said to me.

52:51.284 --> 52:53.351
To you?!

52:53.419 --> 52:56.954
He said they were
having trouble with the electrical system.

52:57.022 --> 52:59.552
Why do you think he was
talking to you personally?

53:01.394 --> 53:03.561
Oh, boy.

53:03.629 --> 53:05.447
Oh, Sam.

53:05.514 --> 53:08.884
Aw, this is going
to be so great.

53:08.952 --> 53:10.085
Mm.

53:10.152 --> 53:12.320
You're going to
love Los Angeles.

53:12.388 --> 53:17.960
I won't pretend it's a
modern-day Athens but...

53:18.027 --> 53:20.879
at least you'll
feel free there,

53:20.947 --> 53:23.482
feel free to explore
your own...

53:23.483 --> 53:26.284
ATTENDANT (over P.A.): Ladies and
gentlemen, this is your flight attendant.

53:26.285 --> 53:27.986
On behalf of your flight crew,

53:28.053 --> 53:30.522
I'd like to apologize
for this delay.

53:30.590 --> 53:32.390
We'll be coming
around the cabin

53:32.458 --> 53:35.694
to make sure you have
everything you need.

53:35.761 --> 53:37.195
And, for God's sake, Diane,

53:37.262 --> 53:39.230
you're a bright, alluring woman

53:39.298 --> 53:42.366
with a great deal
to offer mankind.

53:42.434 --> 53:44.669
Will this man
stimulate your gift

53:44.737 --> 53:47.172
or be an anchor, pulling you

53:47.239 --> 53:49.674
to the bottom of the sea
of mediocrity?

53:55.414 --> 53:57.699
A fair question.

53:57.767 --> 54:00.418
I'm sorry- what is?

54:00.485 --> 54:03.487
Uh, nothing.

54:03.555 --> 54:06.290
These seats are a little
tight, aren't they?

54:06.358 --> 54:08.193
Yeah... yeah.

54:08.260 --> 54:10.461
Well, you know,
it's been a long time

54:10.529 --> 54:12.097
since I've flown first class.

54:12.164 --> 54:14.966
I guess I remember it
being more comfortable.

54:15.034 --> 54:18.469
Yeah, so do I.

54:18.537 --> 54:22.306
I guess I remember life
being more comfortable.

54:24.777 --> 54:26.995
(jet engines revving)

54:27.062 --> 54:28.997
Ah...

54:28.998 --> 54:30.766
We should've flown
another airline, you know.

54:30.767 --> 54:32.100
(clears throat)

54:32.168 --> 54:34.503
Well, it's too late for that.

54:34.504 --> 54:36.938
It doesn't make any sense
to rethink a decision

54:36.939 --> 54:38.089
that's already made.

54:38.090 --> 54:39.641
Yeah, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

54:39.642 --> 54:40.942
A commitment is a commitment.

54:40.943 --> 54:43.745
We wouldn't want to change
things if we could.

54:43.746 --> 54:45.947
CAPTAIN (over P.A.):
I'm sorry folks, but I'm afraid

54:45.948 --> 54:47.749
we're gonna be returning
to the terminal.

54:47.750 --> 54:49.451
We'll have you disembark

54:49.519 --> 54:52.053
and arrange for you
to take an alternate flight.

54:52.121 --> 54:54.356
Maybe we're being
a little overcautious,

54:54.424 --> 54:56.191
but we don't want
to make a mistake

54:56.258 --> 54:57.948
about something this important.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.361
Sorry.

55:11.974 --> 55:13.041
Hey...

55:15.377 --> 55:16.778
You know...

55:16.846 --> 55:18.780
Yes.

55:22.151 --> 55:24.052
I think we both know.

55:32.795 --> 55:34.612
Good night, ladies.
Thanks again.

55:37.116 --> 55:39.167
Do you believe those three?

55:39.235 --> 55:41.436
In here every night
trying to trap guys.

55:41.504 --> 55:44.171
Yeah, yeah... yeah, you'd
never see any wife of mine

55:44.239 --> 55:46.107
showing her face in some bar.

55:46.108 --> 55:47.141
Yeah.

55:47.142 --> 55:48.952
She'd make more money
in a sideshow.

55:53.950 --> 55:55.583
Sam!

55:55.651 --> 55:56.968
What are you doing here?

55:57.036 --> 55:59.120
Well, we changed our minds.

55:59.188 --> 56:00.922
I'm not going to L.A.

56:00.989 --> 56:02.723
Well, where is Diane?

56:02.791 --> 56:05.226
Probably over Kansas by now.

56:05.294 --> 56:07.729
The important thing is
we came to our senses.

56:07.797 --> 56:09.064
I knew you would, Sam.

56:09.065 --> 56:10.131
Yeah.

56:10.132 --> 56:11.566
Yeah, what do you
got there, Sam?

56:11.567 --> 56:13.434
Something I've been holding onto
for a while, Woody.

56:13.435 --> 56:16.237
Uh, I thought maybe it was time
to open it up.

56:19.041 --> 56:22.343
Oh, my!
A box of fine Cuban cigars.

56:22.411 --> 56:24.028
CLIFF:
Uh, Sammy...

56:24.029 --> 56:26.380
I assume you realize that those
are illegal in this country.

56:26.381 --> 56:28.316
Shut up, Cliff.

56:28.383 --> 56:30.251
Aye, aye.

56:30.319 --> 56:32.789
You know, I was hoping you
guys would, uh, join me

56:32.790 --> 56:34.105
in a smoke session tonight.

56:34.106 --> 56:36.274
You know, kind of a
welcome home party.

56:36.342 --> 56:38.142
Cliffie, what do you say, man?

56:38.143 --> 56:40.761
Buddy, I'd love to stay,
but geez, it's getting late.

56:40.762 --> 56:41.929
I better beg off.

56:41.997 --> 56:44.315
Oh, all right.

56:44.383 --> 56:46.567
How 'bout you, Norm?

56:46.635 --> 56:49.487
Can't, Sammy-
I came to the conclusion

56:49.488 --> 56:51.405
I've wasted too
much time in this bar,

56:51.406 --> 56:53.407
like a couple of decades.

56:53.476 --> 56:55.443
Gonna go home to Vera.

56:55.511 --> 56:56.811
SAM:
Vera?

56:56.879 --> 56:58.346
My wife.

56:58.414 --> 57:00.248
Maybe you remember her?

57:00.316 --> 57:02.216
That is her name, isn't it?

57:03.285 --> 57:04.653
See ya.

57:04.654 --> 57:07.755
Well, Carla,
what do you say, huh?

57:07.756 --> 57:09.290
Nah.
My shift's over.

57:09.358 --> 57:11.493
I've got to get home
to the kids.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.961
Appreciate the thought.
Maybe another time.

57:15.230 --> 57:17.031
Doc, help me out here, man.

57:17.099 --> 57:19.333
You want a fine cigar?

57:19.401 --> 57:20.735
Huh?
I'd love to, Sam,

57:20.803 --> 57:22.403
but Lilith just called

57:22.472 --> 57:25.474
and she wants me
to bring home Chinese tonight.

57:25.541 --> 57:27.442
I...

57:27.510 --> 57:29.210
I hope she meant the food.

57:32.447 --> 57:35.717
She's been really weird lately
and... you know.

57:35.718 --> 57:37.418
W-Woody, wait a minute, man.
What about you?

57:37.419 --> 57:39.754
Aw... can't Sam.
I gotta leave right away.

57:39.755 --> 57:40.822
Why?

57:40.823 --> 57:41.990
Carla's my ride.

57:41.991 --> 57:43.241
Well, I'll give you a lift.

57:43.242 --> 57:44.542
What-What's going on here?

57:44.543 --> 57:45.709
Why's everyone leaving?

57:45.710 --> 57:46.911
Come on, Sam.

57:46.979 --> 57:48.913
It's not like this is our home.

57:58.390 --> 58:00.325
Hmm.

58:03.362 --> 58:05.296
Oh, man.

58:08.136 --> 58:10.134
Gotcha!

58:10.135 --> 58:12.503
(all shouting, laughing)

58:12.504 --> 58:13.738
Pull out those smokes, Sam!

58:13.739 --> 58:14.906
Let's fumigate the place!

58:14.907 --> 58:16.541
Oh, you guys.

58:16.609 --> 58:18.860
Diane called us
with the bad news,

58:18.861 --> 58:20.929
so we thought we'd come
cheer you up, Sam.

58:20.930 --> 58:23.598
Oh, man, I thought it
was something, you know,

58:23.599 --> 58:24.799
I had said earlier
might have upset you.

58:24.800 --> 58:25.867
(Frasier chuckles)

58:25.935 --> 58:27.369
No, Sam, you got to go a lot

58:27.436 --> 58:29.371
farther than that
to insult us, eh?

58:29.871 --> 58:32.741
Besides, we knew that you were

58:32.742 --> 58:34.308
going through
a lot of trouble lately.

58:34.309 --> 58:37.195
We're here for you, Sammy,
as long as you need us.

58:37.262 --> 58:40.092
All except for Peterson, who
has to get up in the morning.

58:42.034 --> 58:44.786
You really know how to sink
a party, don't you, Woody?

58:44.853 --> 58:47.088
Here's your bus schedule.

58:47.939 --> 58:50.391
When are you up for re-election?

58:59.418 --> 59:01.052
(scoffs)

59:01.120 --> 59:02.853
Can you believe it?

59:02.922 --> 59:05.423
I forgot our plane tickets.

59:05.490 --> 59:06.690
Oh, oh, oh.

59:06.691 --> 59:07.992
Sam, I'm glad you're here.

59:07.993 --> 59:09.660
Listen, I wanted to tell you.

59:09.728 --> 59:12.831
I really, really like Diane.

59:12.898 --> 59:15.908
And I know you guys are gonna
have a wonderful life together.

59:17.119 --> 59:18.853
Diane and I are finished, honey.

59:18.921 --> 59:21.505
Ding-dong,
saved by the bell.

59:23.308 --> 59:25.176
Well, I'm off

59:25.243 --> 59:26.344
on my honeymoon.

59:26.412 --> 59:27.912
Good-bye, you guys.

59:27.979 --> 59:31.249
Oh, and, I just want to tell you
that, um, the days that I had

59:31.350 --> 59:34.985
here at Cheers were the, they
were the best days of my life.

59:34.986 --> 59:35.970
Really?

59:35.971 --> 59:37.204
Ew.

59:37.205 --> 59:38.723
SAM:
Wh-what are you saying?

59:38.724 --> 59:40.725
You're not gonna come back
and see us anymore?

59:40.726 --> 59:42.676
No, I will, every now
and then, you know.

59:42.677 --> 59:43.845
But I-I'm married now.

59:43.912 --> 59:46.380
I-I can't just hang out
in a bar all day long.

59:46.448 --> 59:49.016
I mean, I-I have my place
in the community.

59:49.084 --> 59:51.336
Hey, by the way,
did I tell you?

59:51.403 --> 59:55.239
Don got a job offer
with the sewer department.

59:55.308 --> 59:57.241
Keep your fingers
crossed for us.

01:00:00.646 --> 01:00:03.047
Can you believe that?

01:00:03.115 --> 01:00:07.118
I shoot for Donald Trump,
and I end up with Ed Norton.

01:00:09.204 --> 01:00:11.505
But you did good, Rebecca.

01:00:11.573 --> 01:00:14.359
I did, didn't I?

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.827
(gasps)

01:00:16.828 --> 01:00:18.363
(giggles):
Bye.

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:20.231
See you, Trixie.

01:00:25.053 --> 01:00:26.821
You know, Sam.
Hmm?

01:00:26.822 --> 01:00:28.523
You really scared us
there before.

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.557
Hmm.

01:00:29.558 --> 01:00:30.892
When you walked
out of here today,

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.894
I thought it was the last
we'd ever see of you.

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:34.094
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:34.095 --> 01:00:35.797
I'm sorry about
blowing up like that.

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:38.699
I hope you understand
where that was coming from.

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.917
That's all right, Sammy.

01:00:39.918 --> 01:00:41.586
We understand.

01:00:41.654 --> 01:00:44.189
Here you are
a washed-up ballplayer,

01:00:44.256 --> 01:00:46.090
alcohol problem.

01:00:46.158 --> 01:00:47.992
Sex problem.

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.927
Lost your one true love.

01:00:49.928 --> 01:00:50.912
Twice.

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.796
No apology necessary.

01:00:53.932 --> 01:00:56.033
Ah.

01:00:56.101 --> 01:00:58.135
Yeah, who was
I kidding, you know?

01:00:58.203 --> 01:01:01.439
Coming in here and telling
you guys you don't have lives.

01:01:01.507 --> 01:01:05.677
I guess I was really
talking about myself.

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.829
God, the irony.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:08.796
Irony.

01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:10.731
ALL:
Irony.

01:01:14.403 --> 01:01:16.721
One by one, I seem to be losing

01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:19.958
my, uh... thrills

01:01:20.025 --> 01:01:22.961
and, uh, tingles, you know?

01:01:23.028 --> 01:01:24.595
I keep asking myself,

01:01:24.663 --> 01:01:27.465
"What-what is
the point to life?"

01:01:27.532 --> 01:01:30.502
Whoo, that's a tough question.

01:01:30.569 --> 01:01:32.604
Yeah.

01:01:32.671 --> 01:01:34.338
Eh.

01:01:34.407 --> 01:01:36.207
Well, I got the answer.

01:01:36.275 --> 01:01:38.209
Somehow, I knew you would.

01:01:41.146 --> 01:01:44.282
Comfortable shoes.

01:01:44.349 --> 01:01:46.201
Shoes?

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:48.435
Yeah, if you're not
wearing comfortable shoes,

01:01:48.436 --> 01:01:49.970
life is just chaos.

01:01:49.971 --> 01:01:51.889
I mean, the greatest
accomplishments in history

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:55.376
have been made by men
wearing accommodating shoes.

01:01:57.445 --> 01:01:58.913
Uh, Frasier, tell me,

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:01.811
who do you think is the
greatest thinker in all mankind?

01:02:01.816 --> 01:02:04.669
I don't know, uh, Aristotle.

01:02:04.737 --> 01:02:06.237
There you go.

01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:07.438
Sandals.

01:02:07.439 --> 01:02:11.325
Perhaps the most
comfortable shoe there is.

01:02:11.326 --> 01:02:13.494
You hardly even know
you have them on.

01:02:13.562 --> 01:02:17.231
I mean, Confucius, thongs.

01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:19.333
Einstein, loose loafers.

01:02:19.401 --> 01:02:21.419
Wow.

01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:24.555
I'll tell you
what the point of life is:

01:02:24.623 --> 01:02:27.925
Having kids.

01:02:27.993 --> 01:02:30.628
Creating life.

01:02:30.696 --> 01:02:33.798
Sure, it's disappointing
and painful,

01:02:33.866 --> 01:02:36.767
heartbreaking at times.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:39.470
Sure, they can drive you crazy
and make you think

01:02:39.538 --> 01:02:41.528
you just can't get through
another day.

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:46.577
Where was I going with this?

01:02:46.578 --> 01:02:51.616
You know, some would say
that the search for meaning

01:02:51.617 --> 01:02:53.317
is a, a waste of time,

01:02:53.385 --> 01:02:57.054
that all human life
is just a cosmic accident,

01:02:57.122 --> 01:02:59.957
an arbitrary conglomeration of

01:03:00.025 --> 01:03:03.411
molecules evolved by chance

01:03:03.478 --> 01:03:06.314
into an organism
with a brain stem,

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:08.917
condemning it to ponder,
futilely,

01:03:08.984 --> 01:03:10.718
the reason behind it all.

01:03:13.722 --> 01:03:15.232
I know Dr. Crane
is just trying

01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:17.225
to keep the
conversation lively...

01:03:19.334 --> 01:03:23.631
All I know is my life
would have been nothing

01:03:23.632 --> 01:03:25.532
if it weren't for all of you.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.553
You people are as dear to me
as my own family.

01:03:28.621 --> 01:03:29.888
More so, in fact.

01:03:29.955 --> 01:03:31.839
Really, Woody?
Oh, yeah.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.924
Well, for one thing,
none of you call me Huckleberry.

01:03:33.925 --> 01:03:36.126
I hate being called
Huckleberry.

01:03:36.127 --> 01:03:37.528
That's your nickname, Wood?

01:03:37.529 --> 01:03:40.297
No, Woody is.

01:03:49.591 --> 01:03:51.625
Well...

01:03:51.693 --> 01:03:54.261
I hate to get all
mushy, but I got to say

01:03:54.329 --> 01:03:57.231
I feel pretty lucky to
have the friends I do.

01:03:57.299 --> 01:03:58.349
Ah.

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:02.219
You know, no one wants
to be the first to say it,

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.655
but I'm not ashamed to admit

01:04:04.723 --> 01:04:07.224
what I think we're all feeling.

01:04:07.292 --> 01:04:11.095
Time goes by... so fast.

01:04:11.162 --> 01:04:13.698
People move in
and out of your life.

01:04:13.765 --> 01:04:17.301
You must never miss an
opportunity to tell these people

01:04:17.368 --> 01:04:20.571
how much they mean to you.

01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:23.307
Well, I...

01:04:24.209 --> 01:04:26.994
I...

01:04:27.746 --> 01:04:30.565
I...

01:04:30.632 --> 01:04:32.249
I...

01:04:38.006 --> 01:04:41.458
I keep coming back
to that shoe thing.

01:04:43.412 --> 01:04:44.478
(phone rings)

01:04:44.546 --> 01:04:45.612
Ooh, that's Vera.

01:04:45.613 --> 01:04:46.931
That's Lilith.
Probably Kelly.

01:04:46.932 --> 01:04:48.833
Could be Ma.
My kids.

01:04:48.834 --> 01:04:50.201
Say, you know what,
wait, don't answer it.

01:04:50.202 --> 01:04:51.602
Just let whoever it is
think that

01:04:51.603 --> 01:04:53.004
we're on our way.
Which is exactly

01:04:53.005 --> 01:04:54.605
where we should be.

01:04:54.606 --> 01:04:55.806
(phone stops ringing)

01:04:55.807 --> 01:04:57.241
Hey, uh,

01:04:57.242 --> 01:04:58.776
thanks for
the Perfecto, Sammy. Yeah.

01:04:58.777 --> 01:05:00.895
Thanks for staying guys.

01:05:00.962 --> 01:05:02.680
Same to you.

01:05:02.681 --> 01:05:04.665
Wouldn't be the same
without you, Sam.

01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:06.600
CLIFF:
Yep.

01:05:06.668 --> 01:05:09.020
Whatever guy follows you, Sam,

01:05:09.087 --> 01:05:12.123
has some pretty
big shoes to fill.

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:14.391
Did you hear that?

01:05:14.459 --> 01:05:16.393
Thus, it all returns
to footwear.

01:05:19.064 --> 01:05:21.315
Night, you guys.

01:05:21.316 --> 01:05:23.217
You know, I still keep
thinking though, uh,

01:05:23.218 --> 01:05:27.521
you know, I want some kind
of change in my life.

01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:29.440
You know something?

01:05:29.508 --> 01:05:31.675
I hate change.

01:05:31.743 --> 01:05:33.077
I mean, you know,

01:05:33.145 --> 01:05:35.513
every day, you wake up,
something's changed.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.116
Everything's just
changing so fast.

01:05:38.183 --> 01:05:40.684
I like things to stay
the way they are, you know?

01:05:40.752 --> 01:05:42.753
I like things you can count on.

01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:46.090
You know, you just gave me
something to think about, Woody.

01:05:46.158 --> 01:05:47.725
Oh, I'm sorry, Sam.

01:05:47.793 --> 01:05:50.594
I hate it when somebody
does that to me.

01:05:50.662 --> 01:05:52.496
Bye, Woody.

01:05:52.564 --> 01:05:54.432
Night, Sam.

01:06:04.143 --> 01:06:05.410
Sammy,

01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:07.728
I didn't want to say this
in front of the others,

01:06:07.729 --> 01:06:09.229
but you know what I think

01:06:09.297 --> 01:06:12.016
the most important thing
in life is?

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:14.318
It's love.

01:06:14.386 --> 01:06:15.953
You want to know what I love?

01:06:16.021 --> 01:06:18.423
Beer, Norm?

01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:20.858
Yeah, I'll have a quick one.

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:31.101
Know what, Sammy,
I love that stool!

01:06:31.169 --> 01:06:33.187
If there's a heaven,

01:06:33.254 --> 01:06:36.157
I don't want to go there unless
my stool is waiting for me.

01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:38.755
And I'll tell you what,
even God better not be on it.

01:06:38.793 --> 01:06:40.961
He wouldn't...

01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:42.763
he wouldn't dare.

01:06:42.831 --> 01:06:44.165
(sighs)

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:47.034
I don't think it matters
what you love, Sammy.

01:06:47.102 --> 01:06:49.470
Could be a person,
could be a thing.

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:52.506
As long as you love it totally,

01:06:52.574 --> 01:06:55.209
completely, without judgment.

01:06:57.379 --> 01:06:59.646
Know what I think?

01:06:59.714 --> 01:07:01.949
I think you ought to go
home and wake up Vera

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:04.451
with a big
kiss and then (sighs)

01:07:04.519 --> 01:07:06.220
do what comes naturally.

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:10.124
Wake her up so she can watch me
eat a bucket of buffalo wings?

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.035
Yeah, well, maybe not.

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:22.153
(sighs)

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.405
Well, I'm off.

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:27.074
(sighs)

01:07:27.142 --> 01:07:29.743
But, um, Sammy, can I let you in
on a little secret?

01:07:29.811 --> 01:07:31.395
Sure.

01:07:31.463 --> 01:07:33.731
I knew you'd come back.

01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:35.566
You did?

01:07:37.519 --> 01:07:40.454
You can never be unfaithful
to your one true love.

01:07:40.522 --> 01:07:42.423
You always come back to her.

01:07:46.378 --> 01:07:48.312
Who is that?

01:07:50.365 --> 01:07:52.299
Think about it, Sam.

01:08:15.407 --> 01:08:17.341
(chuckles softly)

01:08:20.243 --> 01:08:21.379
Boy, I'll tell you...

01:08:24.483 --> 01:08:27.417
I'm the luckiest
son of a bitch on Earth.

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:40.331
(footsteps approaching)

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:42.550
(knocking)

01:08:46.955 --> 01:08:49.773
Sorry, we're closed.
