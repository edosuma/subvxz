04:13.613 --> 04:14.955
Come on, Colonel.

04:16.302 --> 04:18.603
-Get that jeep out of here.
-Right, Kelly.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.466
We've been here for two hours.

04:23.822 --> 04:26.310
No, that's Map Section 3, not 4.

04:27.566 --> 04:30.948
I don't give a damn what Command says
about anything!

04:32.686 --> 04:35.240
Mulligan, I don't think
I'm getting through to you!

04:35.240 --> 04:37.733
You're dropping your damn barrage
on our position!

04:38.030 --> 04:39.175
Sit and see.

04:39.175 --> 04:41.734
You can't hear me?
The reason you can't hear me...

04:41.999 --> 04:44.683
...is because you're firing your mortar
at your end...

04:44.683 --> 04:47.173
...and they're dropping here at our end!

04:48.270 --> 04:49.831
No, the Krauts are not here!

04:49.831 --> 04:51.079
We're here!

04:52.015 --> 04:54.568
Mulligan, your bombs are coming down
on our heads!

04:54.896 --> 04:56.619
I don't know where the Krauts are!

04:56.619 --> 04:59.533
Just lift your goddamned barrage! Over!

05:04.112 --> 05:07.887
I told you to bring me a good looking kid,
not this fat, sausage-chewing wino!

05:07.887 --> 05:11.878
Well, if you were looking for a young boy,
you should've sent somebody else.

05:19.313 --> 05:20.938
Mulligan, you son of a bitch!

05:22.066 --> 05:23.854
They're trying to push up the canal!

05:23.854 --> 05:26.061
What do you want me to do
about it, Petuko?

05:26.321 --> 05:28.077
The halftrack's been wiped out!

05:28.077 --> 05:29.738
And he's been hit.

05:30.161 --> 05:34.155
Go see what's happening. Grace! Jonesy!
Grab a litter and go with Corporal Job.

05:34.610 --> 05:35.984
On the double!

05:37.106 --> 05:38.350
Mickey Mouse.

05:38.801 --> 05:41.387
-It's Mulligan.
-What the hell does he want?

05:41.387 --> 05:42.866
He says he's sorry.

05:42.866 --> 05:44.458
Sorry. Son of a bitch!

05:46.994 --> 05:50.507
Big Joe's a little upset right now.
I think maybe you should leave town.

05:50.507 --> 05:52.684
Get out of the neighborhood.

05:52.684 --> 05:53.770
Right.

05:54.163 --> 05:55.854
Does he speak English?

05:55.854 --> 05:58.509
Yeah, he's a Colonel in lntelligence.

06:00.883 --> 06:04.877
As a big shot with the German lntelligence
you should be able to tell us about Nancy.

06:04.877 --> 06:07.566
-Under the Geneva Convention you only--
-Sit down!

06:08.148 --> 06:11.214
I'm not interested in defenses,
I'm interested in hotels. Okay?

06:12.180 --> 06:14.123
Are there any still standing?

06:14.453 --> 06:16.721
There are three.
Two are defended by units of--

06:17.236 --> 06:18.763
Which is the most comfortable?

06:19.444 --> 06:20.459
I don't know.

06:21.173 --> 06:24.108
Think of us as tourists.
I don't want any military information.

06:24.108 --> 06:26.002
I just want to know the best hotel.

06:27.412 --> 06:29.136
I think it is called the Majestic.

06:29.136 --> 06:30.252
Who's the owner?

06:31.285 --> 06:32.976
I can't remember his name.

06:33.302 --> 06:36.203
All right. Check the Michelin Guide.

06:36.203 --> 06:37.323
What about women?

06:38.901 --> 06:42.131
I must warn you. The German Army
is preparing a counter attack.

06:42.131 --> 06:43.342
Sit down!

06:43.342 --> 06:46.444
Look, we're not worried
about the German Army.

06:46.444 --> 06:49.682
We've got enough troubles of our own.
To the right, General Patton.

06:49.682 --> 06:53.296
To the left, the British Army.
To the rear, our own goddamned artillery.

06:53.296 --> 06:56.715
Besides all that, it's raining.
And the good thing about the weather is...

06:56.715 --> 06:59.212
...it keeps our Air Corps
from blowing us to hell...

06:59.212 --> 07:01.459
...because it's too lousy to fly. Verstehen?

07:02.359 --> 07:04.530
-Ich verstehe.
-Okay.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.488
What about the broads in Nancy?

07:10.359 --> 07:11.090
Broads?

07:11.352 --> 07:12.300
The women!

07:12.952 --> 07:16.246
Yes, there is a house.
I cannot give you the directions.

07:16.246 --> 07:17.556
I've never been there.

07:18.584 --> 07:20.340
Here it is. "Nancy.

07:20.856 --> 07:22.133
"Principle attractions:

07:22.133 --> 07:25.745
"The church of the Cordeliers tombs.
Woodwork and statues.

07:25.745 --> 07:29.843
"City Hall, 18th century,
with stairway and square reception room.

07:30.168 --> 07:32.340
"Place Stanislas. Impressive gates.

07:32.729 --> 07:35.216
"Porterie, Museum of Lorrain.
Charge to see--"

07:35.216 --> 07:38.420
Will you cut the culture crap
and get to the hotels?

07:39.417 --> 07:42.286
Majestic Hotel, three stars,
a knife and a fork.

07:42.286 --> 07:43.538
Beautiful.

07:44.057 --> 07:47.669
We'll keep this guy until we get to Nancy.
We can use him when we get to town.

07:48.057 --> 07:49.464
What do you want, Barbara?

07:49.689 --> 07:51.217
The Captain wants to see you.

07:52.090 --> 07:53.366
I'll be right with you.

07:53.366 --> 07:55.288
-What should I do?
-Stay on the radio.

07:55.288 --> 07:57.842
I think we ought to send him back
to interrogation.

07:58.202 --> 08:00.723
Nobody's copping out on this.
Do you understand?

08:00.723 --> 08:03.379
He serves a more strategic purpose
by staying with us.

08:03.379 --> 08:05.905
If he needs interrogating,
then you do it right here.

08:05.905 --> 08:07.091
Open the door.

08:12.155 --> 08:14.226
-What do you want?
-Do me a favor, will you?

08:14.226 --> 08:15.859
-What?
-Don't call me Barbara.

08:15.859 --> 08:18.615
-That's your name, isn't it?
-But, my name's Babra.

08:18.615 --> 08:20.920
-Come on, will you?
-But, I only wanted to....

08:38.491 --> 08:39.833
What are these, Colonel?

08:39.833 --> 08:42.649
Just my orders and letters of transport.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.241
Fisher?

08:44.956 --> 08:46.483
What are you transporting?

08:46.483 --> 08:47.571
Files.

08:48.733 --> 08:49.846
What kind of files?

08:50.685 --> 08:51.797
Clerical.

08:54.109 --> 08:56.498
Mind telling me what you were doing
in this area?

08:56.498 --> 08:59.191
I needed petrol for my trucks.
The bombing....

08:59.422 --> 09:01.330
Trucks won't move without petrol.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.166
What do you want?

09:06.166 --> 09:08.180
Interpret these for me, will you?

09:12.189 --> 09:13.237
What are these?

09:14.110 --> 09:15.287
Lead bars.

09:15.287 --> 09:16.318
Lead?

09:17.502 --> 09:20.436
Yes, the bag was supposed
to have been dropped in the water...

09:20.436 --> 09:21.820
...in case of capture.

09:21.820 --> 09:24.252
Unfortunately, you surprised me.

09:24.252 --> 09:28.309
All these papers are about some kind
of convoy from France to Germany.

09:28.511 --> 09:30.398
Code name is Tannenbaum.

09:30.782 --> 09:32.790
Travel reports are a shipment of--

09:32.790 --> 09:34.041
That's enough.

09:35.264 --> 09:36.278
Thanks!

09:39.040 --> 09:40.086
Colonel....

09:42.207 --> 09:43.451
Come here, Colonel.

09:43.451 --> 09:46.333
Oh, Little Joe,
give me that brandy, will you?

09:46.333 --> 09:48.734
-What for?
-Just give me the brandy!

09:48.734 --> 09:53.053
Kelly, what do you want to give away
the good brandy to the Kraut for?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.102
This way, Colonel.

09:56.256 --> 09:57.369
Over here.

09:58.433 --> 10:00.058
Sit down on this bench.

10:07.009 --> 10:08.733
I want you to have a drink.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.281
-Under the Geneva Convention--
-This isn't Geneva, Colonel.

10:12.281 --> 10:15.320
I just want to have a nice sociable talk
with you, that's all.

10:18.210 --> 10:19.158
Go ahead.

10:19.553 --> 10:20.251
Drink!

10:20.251 --> 10:22.777
But I will not divulge
any further information.

10:23.714 --> 10:24.696
Drink!

10:30.818 --> 10:32.378
You idiot! Hold it!

10:33.923 --> 10:35.352
Come on, cover me.

10:46.852 --> 10:48.258
-Mitchell?
-Yeah?

10:48.258 --> 10:49.499
Big Joe.

10:50.723 --> 10:52.665
All right, you stay here.

10:54.628 --> 10:56.221
-Where is he?
-Inside.

11:00.900 --> 11:01.794
Captain?

11:02.020 --> 11:03.449
Yeah, who is it?

11:03.449 --> 11:05.215
It's me, Big Joe. Where are you?

11:05.828 --> 11:06.690
I'm in here.

11:08.324 --> 11:11.172
-What are you doing there, sir?
-I'm checking out the motor.

11:11.172 --> 11:12.643
The motor? What for?

11:13.156 --> 11:16.899
We're pulling out and I want to see if
this boat's worth taking back to the base.

11:16.899 --> 11:18.241
What about Nancy?

11:18.241 --> 11:21.243
Third Army's taking over.
We go into reserve.

11:21.243 --> 11:23.684
When they take Nancy,
we go back in the line.

11:24.710 --> 11:27.327
I don't think you have the welfare
of your men at heart.

11:27.327 --> 11:30.690
This is a big town,
with a lot of passionate broads...

11:30.690 --> 11:33.758
...great restaurants, feather beds
in rooms with hot water....

11:33.758 --> 11:37.953
Look, Captain, we've been rained on,
pushed on, bombed on...

11:37.953 --> 11:41.186
...mortared on by Mulligan all the way
from the Normandy Beachhead.

11:42.054 --> 11:43.909
I'm aware of that problem, Sergeant.

11:43.909 --> 11:48.259
You've been aware of that problem ever
since we got out of the water at Omaha!

11:48.518 --> 11:51.814
Look, why is it that every time
we get to a town like Nancy...

11:51.814 --> 11:54.334
...these guys with the clean uniforms
and the ties...

11:54.334 --> 11:57.156
...get to ride in the trucks into town
and make their pitch?

11:57.156 --> 11:59.678
The General says we pull out,
so we pull out.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.597
Look, Captain! You can't let them do this!

12:03.656 --> 12:06.917
I must get my men near some broads
before they start freaking-out.

12:06.917 --> 12:09.701
I'm aware that,
that situation might be developing.

12:09.701 --> 12:12.005
Think I could get this in the hold of a B-17?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.534
We're point section
to the whole damn Army!

12:14.534 --> 12:16.355
Nancy's our town, Captain!

12:16.936 --> 12:19.303
Babra says there's a company
of Germans pushing up.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.540
I'll be with you in a minute! Captain!

12:21.540 --> 12:23.846
We got it all figured out.
We even got a guide!

12:23.846 --> 12:27.971
-All we have to do is get in there!
-These German divisions say you can't.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.662
So we need a little help!

12:29.662 --> 12:31.876
All I need is to get this yacht out of here.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.815
Get back to the barn.
I'll get the engineers and do it myself.

12:34.815 --> 12:37.191
You're supposed to be
in charge of this outfit!

12:37.545 --> 12:40.360
You're doing such a good job.
Why should I get in your way?

12:43.626 --> 12:44.674
Hey, Cowboy!

12:45.673 --> 12:49.929
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated.

12:52.010 --> 12:56.134
Hold it down there a bit, Willard.
The Corporal's trying to tell us something.

12:56.134 --> 12:58.057
Yes, sir. You're telling me what?

12:58.057 --> 13:02.247
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated!

13:02.539 --> 13:05.408
Now, come on, pal!
Ain't you got any Shermans?

13:05.408 --> 13:07.752
We've been polishing these things
for two days!

13:07.752 --> 13:10.787
If we take them out there in that rain,
they'll rust up on us.

13:10.787 --> 13:12.234
Don't give me a hard time.

13:12.234 --> 13:14.087
Get off your ass, and get out there!

13:14.539 --> 13:16.644
Yes, sir. I didn't mean nothing!

13:16.644 --> 13:20.392
I was just trying to tell you
how we're feeling, ain't that right, Willy?

13:20.683 --> 13:24.327
"Hold the ground at all costs"?
But we're a reconnaissance company!

13:24.327 --> 13:27.298
It's not our job to hold the ground!
That's an infantry's job!

13:27.298 --> 13:29.445
We're supposed to go out
and find someplace...

13:29.445 --> 13:32.419
...look at it and tell you
what the situation is.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.482
I can tell you what the situation is!
It stinks!

13:36.482 --> 13:39.306
It's wet, it's cold,
and we're under heavy fire!

13:40.301 --> 13:41.927
Yes! Yes!

13:43.340 --> 13:45.315
Are they sending anything to support us?

13:45.315 --> 13:48.685
They say they haven't got anything.
We've been ordered to hold.

13:48.685 --> 13:51.335
-Hold! With what?
-That's what I told them!

13:52.910 --> 13:55.910
You think we ought to pull out?

13:57.710 --> 14:00.231
I don't know. Better wait for Big Joe.

14:00.622 --> 14:04.615
Those are not Mulligan's mortars anymore.
Those are German 88s!

14:04.942 --> 14:09.318
As much as I like Big Joe, I don't want
to spend the rest of the war in a camp.

14:09.318 --> 14:13.284
Besides which, I'm first-generation ltalian,
they'd shoot me as a traitor.

14:13.284 --> 14:16.588
The indications are the Germans
are coming and we won't stop them.

14:16.588 --> 14:20.518
With your permission, I'll pull the vehicle
to the other side of the canal.

14:23.247 --> 14:24.108
Yeah, go on.

14:24.847 --> 14:27.182
Penn, Fisher! Get that damn thing
out of here!

14:27.182 --> 14:29.931
Okay, everybody!
We're pulling out on the double!

14:30.736 --> 14:31.914
Move that stretcher!

14:35.440 --> 14:37.066
God damn it, Cowboy!

14:37.456 --> 14:41.613
I don't know what you was talking about!
There ain't three tanks, there's about 20!

14:41.613 --> 14:43.371
-Ain't that right, Willy?
-Right.

14:43.371 --> 14:46.221
Get that thing to the other side
of the canal, you maniac!

14:46.221 --> 14:49.255
Well, that's what we was figuring on doing.

14:54.481 --> 14:55.910
Kelly, come on, we're going.

14:55.910 --> 14:57.643
You're coming, ain't you?

14:57.905 --> 14:58.766
Go on ahead.

14:59.058 --> 15:00.651
All right, good luck!

15:00.651 --> 15:02.476
Okay, Penn, let's go!

15:59.413 --> 16:02.380
How many more bars of gold like this
do you have in that convoy?

16:03.285 --> 16:04.300
Vierzehn.

16:04.533 --> 16:06.159
Come on, speak English, Colonel.

16:07.285 --> 16:09.227
How many bars like this in your trucks?

16:11.381 --> 16:12.329
Fourteen.

16:12.725 --> 16:13.674
Fourteen what?

16:14.069 --> 16:15.018
Thousand.

16:17.782 --> 16:19.211
Fourteen thousand?

16:25.622 --> 16:27.248
Where is your convoy right now?

16:28.343 --> 16:30.131
Where are your trucks?

16:31.286 --> 16:32.301
Clermont.

16:32.301 --> 16:34.284
In Clermont. Clermont?

16:34.551 --> 16:36.624
Is the gold still in the trucks?

16:38.552 --> 16:39.696
Nein!

16:41.494 --> 16:43.502
Whereabouts? Whereabouts is the gold?

16:44.375 --> 16:45.804
In the bank.

16:48.631 --> 16:51.860
Colonel? Wake up, wake up.
What about support units?

16:52.600 --> 16:53.615
Support?

16:53.615 --> 16:54.613
Yeah, tanks.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.749
Come on, tanks. Stuff like that.

16:59.448 --> 17:00.560
Tanks!

17:01.495 --> 17:03.732
Three Tiger tanks.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.491
What about infantry?

17:07.193 --> 17:09.396
What about infantry, Colonel?

17:22.137 --> 17:24.952
-Did you hear from Headquarters?
-We've been ordered to hold.

17:24.952 --> 17:28.083
I'll tell them what to hold!
The Third took over one hour ago!

17:28.083 --> 17:29.877
-We're pulling out of here!
-Great!

17:29.877 --> 17:32.498
-Where's Maitland?
-He's salvaging a yacht.

17:32.498 --> 17:33.683
-A yacht?
-A yacht!

17:34.074 --> 17:36.977
-I'll see you about 10 miles down the road.
-Wait a minute!

17:36.977 --> 17:40.758
-Is everybody across the bridge?
-Kelly's still in the barn with that Colonel.

17:40.758 --> 17:43.729
-Did you tell him we're pulling out?
-We told him. He's crazy!

17:44.443 --> 17:48.217
Tell Mulligan to give me three minutes
and lay all the mortar into that barn.

17:48.217 --> 17:50.038
-Do you understand?
-If you say so.

17:50.038 --> 17:51.154
You wait here.

17:52.059 --> 17:53.172
Mulligan!

17:54.619 --> 17:56.442
Come on, Colonel. Come on.

17:57.755 --> 17:59.730
Get up and sit right here.

18:10.940 --> 18:13.940
Kelly! Halfthe German Army's
coming up the road.

18:14.172 --> 18:17.270
In minutes, Mulligan will drop
10 tons of mortar on this joint!

18:17.270 --> 18:20.023
-What the are you doing?
-I'm looking after the Colonel.

18:20.023 --> 18:22.231
Shoot him and let's get the hell
out of here!

18:22.231 --> 18:24.089
Shoot him, we don't get the gold.

18:24.089 --> 18:25.051
What gold?

18:25.051 --> 18:28.379
The gold that's in a bank 25 miles east
of Nancy, that's what.

18:29.085 --> 18:32.860
Mulligan, I said three minutes!
Come on, let's get out of here!

18:56.766 --> 18:58.522
Kelly? You okay, Kelly?

18:58.846 --> 18:59.992
Yeah, I'm all right.

19:03.616 --> 19:06.266
Come on, you nut!
Let's get the hell out of here!

19:16.159 --> 19:19.225
Fisher! Petuko! Come on,
we're moving out! Move it out!

19:19.743 --> 19:22.711
Move it out! Babra! Come on! Move it!

19:24.033 --> 19:25.439
Get in, we're pulling out!

19:47.713 --> 19:48.695
Kelly, you nut!

19:48.994 --> 19:50.074
Come on!

20:28.004 --> 20:30.371
Wait a minute, will you?
Will you wait a minute?

20:30.371 --> 20:33.370
Listen to me a second.
It's not me, I tell you. It's not me!

20:33.370 --> 20:36.259
I can't tell one shell from another!
They all look alike.

20:36.259 --> 20:37.601
They all look alike.

20:37.601 --> 20:40.221
If it was me....
If I could tell, would I be here?

20:40.221 --> 20:42.877
Would I be here? I wouldn't be here, Kelly!

20:42.877 --> 20:46.724
I'd be in the States checking out the duds.
I'd be out with all those broads!

20:46.724 --> 20:48.796
-I'd be working in a factory.
-Relax.

20:48.796 --> 20:52.098
Wait a minute! We've got to have
a little understanding around here.

20:52.098 --> 20:55.263
How the hell do we ever get
any understanding around here, Kelly?

20:55.263 --> 20:56.315
Relax.

20:58.533 --> 21:00.802
Mulligan, I just want
to make you a proposition.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.377
A proposition?

21:09.702 --> 21:12.068
Well, is it dirty, or just illegal?

21:16.486 --> 21:18.658
I want you to set up a barrage for me.

21:19.847 --> 21:22.148
I want you to lay down a barrage for me.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.898
Grid section 7,
right here at these crossroads.

21:26.503 --> 21:28.772
I got to have a signed order from the C.O.

21:28.772 --> 21:30.498
I need an authorization.

21:30.498 --> 21:34.275
You see, that's just the problem, Mulligan.
We don't have an authorization.

21:34.631 --> 21:36.126
You don't have a....

21:36.487 --> 21:39.237
Kelly, without an authorization,
I can't help you.

21:40.743 --> 21:44.322
I told you I had a proposition, Mulligan.
That's just what I meant.

21:45.128 --> 21:46.502
A proposition.

21:59.529 --> 22:00.357
Why?

22:01.800 --> 22:02.749
Why what?

22:03.401 --> 22:04.481
Why....

22:07.081 --> 22:08.009
Why not?

22:10.089 --> 22:11.845
You won't forget me now, will you?

22:11.845 --> 22:13.823
Why, no. I won't forget, Kelly.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.095
You're a good man, Mulligan.

22:33.771 --> 22:35.462
-Come on!
-Screw you, Mac!

22:35.462 --> 22:36.676
Come on, move it!

22:36.676 --> 22:37.857
Up yours, baby!

22:38.507 --> 22:40.361
Hey, come on, get it out of there!

22:40.779 --> 22:41.640
Come on!

22:41.640 --> 22:43.682
Hey, come on, come on. Move it!

22:44.971 --> 22:47.689
All right, come on, you guys!
Clear it out! Clear it out!

22:47.689 --> 22:51.169
Come on, get the horse out of here!
Get on the side, will you?

22:51.691 --> 22:53.764
Move it out, come on now!
Move it, move it!

22:55.468 --> 22:57.802
Keep it going, boys. Move it through.

22:57.802 --> 22:59.875
All right, keep it going. Let's go.

23:00.076 --> 23:01.702
A message from Captain Maitland.

23:01.702 --> 23:03.113
-Did you read it?
-Yeah.

23:03.113 --> 23:05.701
-What's it say?
-He wanted you to read it, Joe.

23:06.028 --> 23:08.777
Take the underwear off your head.
Enough is enough.

23:11.692 --> 23:13.449
We've been ordered to pull back.

23:13.869 --> 23:15.560
We've been ordered to pull back.

23:15.885 --> 23:17.260
Yeah, I heard.

23:17.549 --> 23:18.476
All right!

23:18.956 --> 23:22.732
We've been ordered back
to map reference 473, so let's move it!

23:22.957 --> 23:25.063
But my hair is still in curlers!

23:25.063 --> 23:26.890
That's telling them, Willard!

23:27.278 --> 23:28.684
Come on, let's move it out.

23:28.684 --> 23:30.539
Joe, what about Nancy?

23:31.150 --> 23:32.644
Pack it up, let's move.

23:34.511 --> 23:36.453
Move them out, will you, Corporal?

23:43.535 --> 23:44.779
Where have you been?

23:45.007 --> 23:47.015
-Checking a few things out.
-Like what?

23:48.047 --> 23:49.672
I'm going after that gold, Joe.

23:50.286 --> 23:51.530
That's what I thought.

23:51.530 --> 23:52.646
Do you want in?

23:52.646 --> 23:53.864
Do I want in?

23:55.183 --> 23:57.866
Let me tell you something,
I'll say it nice and clear.

23:57.866 --> 24:01.448
I got a job to do and that is
to get you guys to Berlin alive.

24:01.448 --> 24:03.941
We've been at the front end
of this war all the way.

24:03.941 --> 24:06.504
If you whisper one word
about the gold to the guys...

24:06.504 --> 24:10.318
...l'll bounce you from this outfit so fast
your feet won't even touch the ground.

24:10.318 --> 24:11.497
Do you understand?

24:12.016 --> 24:13.772
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

24:14.321 --> 24:17.866
You'd better fix up some transfer papers
for me, because I'm going.

24:17.866 --> 24:19.592
With you or without you.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.648
Okay.

24:31.409 --> 24:35.119
-Come on, give me a hand down there.
-What a bunch of shit this is!

24:49.426 --> 24:52.743
Sergeant, everything's secure up here.
I'm coming down now.

25:02.963 --> 25:04.076
Hi, Captain.

25:04.340 --> 25:07.372
Sergeant, do you think I can get this yacht
to Paris by Sunday?

25:07.372 --> 25:10.672
You didn't bring me to this farmhouse
to talk about this boat again?

25:10.672 --> 25:14.285
I made a deal with Headquarters.
I have three days rest for you and the men.

25:14.285 --> 25:15.981
Make sure they have a good time.

25:15.981 --> 25:19.248
I must get this yacht to Paris
and get some things for the General.

25:19.248 --> 25:21.104
And where do we spend this vacation?

25:21.104 --> 25:22.579
Right here, Sergeant.

25:26.420 --> 25:27.468
Are you kidding?

25:27.468 --> 25:30.836
I'm not kidding. With a little imagination,
you can fix this place up.

25:30.836 --> 25:33.683
Lay out a baseball diamond.
Run the water into the house.

25:33.683 --> 25:36.847
Special service is coming by
with some magazines and paperbacks.

25:36.847 --> 25:38.957
We're 10 miles from the nearest town!

25:38.957 --> 25:40.305
There's no action!

25:40.305 --> 25:43.243
That's the beautiful thing
about this location. It's quiet.

25:43.243 --> 25:46.862
Get yourselves a suntan, a little rest.
In three days we're back in the line.

25:48.341 --> 25:51.091
-We're all ready to move out!
-Yeah, I'm coming. Go ahead.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.710
There's no booze, there's no broads,
there's no action!

25:53.710 --> 25:54.959
That's another thing.

25:54.959 --> 25:57.648
Don't fool around with the women,
their husbands carry guns.

25:57.648 --> 25:59.954
Don't forget, the penalty
for looting is death!

26:00.502 --> 26:02.924
Loot what? There's nothing here to loot!

26:03.319 --> 26:05.228
I'll be back in three days.

26:15.062 --> 26:17.812
"Get yourself a suntan and get some rest."

26:18.423 --> 26:20.017
He's got to be out of his mind!

26:20.407 --> 26:23.440
But how does he get away with it?
That's what I'd like to know.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.741
Very simple. The General's his uncle,
that's how.

27:06.618 --> 27:07.600
Crapgame?

27:08.249 --> 27:09.395
What do you want?

27:10.234 --> 27:12.241
I want to talk to you for a few minutes.

27:13.690 --> 27:14.618
What about?

27:16.442 --> 27:19.061
I have this deal I've been working on.

27:19.707 --> 27:23.023
I thought you might be interested
in helping me out.

27:23.803 --> 27:25.396
What kind of deal?

27:25.786 --> 27:27.096
A private deal.

27:27.675 --> 27:29.563
Harry, go get yourself a haircut.

27:32.219 --> 27:35.066
I hear Maitland's got himself a yacht
and taking it to Paris.

27:35.066 --> 27:36.187
That's right.

27:36.187 --> 27:38.968
There's no money in yachts.
What does he want a yacht for?

27:38.968 --> 27:42.035
Who cares, as long as it keeps him
out of our hair for a few days?

27:43.004 --> 27:44.182
Okay, Kelly.

27:45.276 --> 27:46.967
What is it? What is it you want?

27:48.669 --> 27:52.694
Well, I want 15 Thompson's,
two .30 caliber machine guns...

27:52.694 --> 27:54.836
...two bazookas, two field radios...

27:55.548 --> 27:59.804
...and supplies and ammunition to last
a platoon of men in the field for three days.

27:59.804 --> 28:00.944
Is that all?

28:00.944 --> 28:01.979
Nope!

28:03.165 --> 28:07.289
I want the lntelligence report
for this whole sector in the next two hours.

28:08.062 --> 28:10.483
That's nice. What's in it for me?

28:11.485 --> 28:14.235
-A piece of the action.
-What kind of action?

28:15.806 --> 28:17.017
This kind of action.

28:33.279 --> 28:36.061
Hello, Izzy? Yeah, it's me, it's me.

28:36.383 --> 28:39.863
Listen, get me a quotation for gold
on the Paris market.

28:40.830 --> 28:42.871
Yeah, now, and hurry it up!

28:47.776 --> 28:49.531
How much more where this came from?

28:51.231 --> 28:53.086
Fourteen thousand bars.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.111
Fourteen thousand bars?

28:58.752 --> 29:00.214
Fourteen thousand!

29:00.672 --> 29:03.902
Hey, sweetheart, have yourself a bottle
of booze, you're beautiful!

29:03.902 --> 29:05.659
Fourteen thousand bars!

29:06.944 --> 29:09.082
That's beautiful! Where is it?

29:09.665 --> 29:10.842
In a bank.

29:11.489 --> 29:12.569
In a bank?

29:14.561 --> 29:16.667
You're getting pretty ambitious,
aren't you?

29:16.667 --> 29:19.104
To think you can blow a bank
and get away with it?

29:19.393 --> 29:20.800
It's behind enemy lines.

29:22.050 --> 29:23.708
Behind enemy lines.

29:28.129 --> 29:29.951
That could be the perfect crime.

29:36.706 --> 29:38.647
Right. Right, I got you.

29:47.618 --> 29:49.527
$1.6 million.

29:51.362 --> 29:52.704
What else will you need?

29:52.704 --> 29:56.962
-You could probably use some armor.
-What are you doing up there?

29:56.962 --> 29:58.204
I crept in.

29:58.204 --> 29:59.453
Who the hell's that?

29:59.453 --> 30:01.149
His name's Oddball.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.352
I got three Shermans outside.

30:05.124 --> 30:06.073
What outfit?

30:07.268 --> 30:09.788
Right now I don't have any outfit.

30:13.220 --> 30:14.747
Who's your commanding officer?

30:15.012 --> 30:18.208
He got decapitated by an 88
about six weeks ago.

30:18.208 --> 30:19.705
But don't say you're sorry.

30:19.705 --> 30:23.130
He's been trying to get us killed
ever since we landed at Omaha Beach.

30:23.130 --> 30:24.219
It's terrible.

30:24.219 --> 30:27.871
He hasn't reported him dead yet.
You see, I've been collecting his whiskey.

30:27.871 --> 30:31.072
We see our role
as essentially a defensive image.

30:31.072 --> 30:33.313
While our armies are advancing so fast...

30:33.313 --> 30:36.162
...and everyone's knocking themselves out
to be heroes...

30:36.162 --> 30:39.841
...we are holding ourselves in reserve
in case the Krauts mount...

30:39.841 --> 30:44.514
...a counteroffensive which threatens Paris
or maybe even New York.

30:44.514 --> 30:47.132
Then we can move in and stop them.

30:47.686 --> 30:50.337
But for $1.6 million...

30:51.366 --> 30:54.018
...we could become heroes for three days.

30:57.766 --> 31:00.516
A Sherman can give you a very nice edge.

31:02.919 --> 31:04.293
Where are these Shermans?

31:05.287 --> 31:06.595
They're outside.

31:07.335 --> 31:09.245
Come on, I'll show them to you.

31:39.497 --> 31:41.090
These are my boys.

32:13.419 --> 32:15.142
And these are your tanks?

32:20.620 --> 32:22.955
Don't let the dirt and the rust hang you up.

32:22.955 --> 32:25.669
We like to give the impression
that we're out of action.

32:25.669 --> 32:28.706
Badly in need of a period
of rest and reorganization.

32:29.836 --> 32:31.592
That way nobody bugs us.

32:36.300 --> 32:37.991
Come on, look at the engine.

32:44.044 --> 32:47.689
This engine's been modified
by our mechanical genius here, Moriarty.

32:47.916 --> 32:48.899
Right?

32:49.101 --> 32:50.727
Whatever you say, babe.

32:53.805 --> 32:58.443
These tanks are faster than any other tanks
in Europe. Forwards or backwards.

32:59.310 --> 33:03.238
We like to feel that we can get out
of trouble quicker than we got into it.

33:07.598 --> 33:08.973
Any other secret weapons?

33:09.710 --> 33:10.692
Oh, yeah.

33:11.054 --> 33:14.185
All the tanks we come up against
are bigger and better than ours.

33:14.185 --> 33:16.905
So that all we can hope to do
is like scare them away.

33:16.905 --> 33:19.178
This gun is an ordinary 76 millimeter...

33:19.178 --> 33:22.508
...but we added a piece of pipe onto it
and the Krauts think...

33:22.508 --> 33:24.101
...maybe it's a 90 millimeter.

33:24.494 --> 33:26.153
We got our own ammunition.

33:26.153 --> 33:30.533
It's filled with paint.
When we fire it, it makes pretty pictures.

33:30.533 --> 33:32.548
It scares the hell out of people.

33:34.896 --> 33:38.824
We got a loudspeaker. When we go
into battle, we play music very loud.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.483
It kind of...

33:42.031 --> 33:43.308
...calms us down.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.281
Come on inside for a minute.

34:00.369 --> 34:02.921
If I hear any more threats
against Maitland's life...

34:02.921 --> 34:06.440
...or wild talk about going to Headquarters
and killing the General...

34:06.440 --> 34:10.953
...or raping the nurses at the field hospital,
I'll strangle the guy with my bare hands!

34:10.953 --> 34:13.197
All good things come to those who wait!

34:13.969 --> 34:16.839
We're gonna have a lot of fun here!
Aren't we, Cowboy?

34:16.839 --> 34:19.761
-You can bet your boots on that, partner.
-Sergeant, partner!

34:19.761 --> 34:20.969
Right, Sarge.

34:22.290 --> 34:24.199
I think I've got the crabs.

34:25.138 --> 34:28.237
We'll boil our laundry!
We'll set up a little shower area...

34:28.237 --> 34:31.208
...so we can wash our cute little bodies.
Right, Barbara?

34:31.208 --> 34:32.264
Shut up!

34:32.818 --> 34:33.833
Shave!

34:33.833 --> 34:36.973
A little wine, women and song.
A little chiquita for you, Petuko.

34:36.973 --> 34:40.971
It'll take time to get organized, but I want
that farmhouse to look like a nightclub!

34:40.971 --> 34:41.991
Little Joe!

34:41.991 --> 34:43.561
I want you to set up a bar!

34:43.561 --> 34:45.009
We ain't got no booze.

34:45.009 --> 34:48.521
"We ain't got no booze."
Well, we're gonna get some booze!

34:48.788 --> 34:50.641
I'm gonna go down to the Battalion...

34:50.641 --> 34:54.221
...see if I can lay my hands on
some dirty movies and when I come back...

34:54.772 --> 34:58.384
...l want that farmhouse not only clean,
but completely decorated!

34:58.384 --> 34:59.728
Do you understand that?

34:59.728 --> 35:02.577
All right, Corporal, fall them out!
Let's get moving.

35:05.908 --> 35:07.403
$16 million.

35:10.676 --> 35:11.854
$16 million.

35:12.628 --> 35:14.701
Kelly, I think I made a slight mistake.

35:14.701 --> 35:17.905
It's not $1.6 million, it's $16 million!

35:18.197 --> 35:19.211
What a bundle!

35:19.989 --> 35:22.161
We'll need plenty of gasoline on this trip.

35:22.389 --> 35:24.593
Think you can get it through enemy lines?

35:24.593 --> 35:26.636
Just name the place, baby.

35:29.045 --> 35:31.216
Right here. Grid section B.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.813
Tonight at 21:00.

35:32.813 --> 35:35.985
No good, man. The boys have got
something special on tonight.

35:36.215 --> 35:38.931
Are you nuts?
What's more important than $16 million?

35:39.190 --> 35:42.573
You come around tonight, Crapgame,
and we'll show you.

35:43.094 --> 35:44.022
Okay.

35:44.918 --> 35:47.439
Tomorrow night, then.
Along this road, same hour.

35:47.439 --> 35:49.067
We'll be there.

35:49.495 --> 35:53.685
-If you're late, we move out without you.
-If we're late, it's because we're dead.

35:53.685 --> 35:54.897
What about Big Joe?

35:54.897 --> 35:57.204
You handle the supplies,
I'll take care of him.

35:57.204 --> 36:00.086
Not only that, but I'm going along
to protect my investment.

36:00.086 --> 36:01.166
You don't trust me.

36:01.166 --> 36:04.273
A firm financial mind should be behind
an enterprise such as this.

36:04.273 --> 36:07.824
There could be a bonus. Besides,
Switzerland's only 100 miles away.

36:08.215 --> 36:10.517
I don't want anybody getting lost.

36:11.448 --> 36:14.066
I don't want halfthe Army in on this deal.

36:14.066 --> 36:17.748
No friends or friends of friends.
I want to keep it a tight little unit.

36:18.136 --> 36:19.565
Right, Oddball?

36:20.600 --> 36:21.910
Oh, yeah, man.

36:22.969 --> 36:24.114
No sweat, you know?

36:27.320 --> 36:29.688
I'll pick you up in about an hour.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.499
You can hang onto that bar of gold
as a deposit.

36:36.441 --> 36:38.002
Who is that guy, Crapgame?

36:38.457 --> 36:40.596
His name's Kelly. Used to be a lieutenant.

36:40.986 --> 36:43.986
Pretty good one, too,
until was ordered to attack the wrong hill.

36:43.986 --> 36:45.847
Wiped out half a company of G.I.'s.

36:46.106 --> 36:48.789
Somebody had to get the blame,
and he got picked.

36:51.002 --> 36:53.107
Oh, man, I don't like officers.

36:58.363 --> 37:00.305
Neither does he, so relax.

37:05.755 --> 37:07.413
Get me Hogan in lntelligence.

37:12.412 --> 37:15.379
Do you mind if I take this bar of gold
and show it to the boys?

37:15.675 --> 37:19.058
No, not at all, but just remember
where you found it. Bring it back here.

37:20.796 --> 37:22.902
You're a good boy, Crapgame.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.747
Something's wrong with him.

37:26.396 --> 37:28.283
Hello, Hogan? It's Crapgame.

37:29.404 --> 37:31.859
I got you the scotch
and the nylons you wanted.

37:33.981 --> 37:35.322
Do I ever fail you?

37:35.772 --> 37:37.779
You better believe it. Never miss.

37:39.004 --> 37:40.084
Listen...

37:40.797 --> 37:43.253
...l got a little favor to ask of you.

37:45.917 --> 37:48.852
Will you stop crying,
I haven't even asked you yet!

37:49.598 --> 37:51.321
What's the matter with you?

38:10.527 --> 38:12.251
You wait here, Padre.

38:22.592 --> 38:25.275
I warned you, if you started anything,
I'd bust you out.

38:28.096 --> 38:29.951
If you transfer me, Joe...

38:30.304 --> 38:32.671
...you have to transfer every man
in this outfit.

38:32.671 --> 38:34.524
I told you to lay offthese guys!

38:34.524 --> 38:38.487
-Take it easy. He's got it all figured out.
-Who invited you, Hustler?

38:38.977 --> 38:39.992
He did.

38:41.793 --> 38:45.884
It's a snap.
$16 million just waiting to be picked up.

38:46.272 --> 38:48.694
Did he forget to tell you
it's behind enemy lines?

38:48.694 --> 38:49.728
I told them.

38:49.728 --> 38:50.621
Yeah?

38:50.621 --> 38:54.071
Did you tell them how to get through
and cover 30 miles to Clermont?

38:54.071 --> 38:55.770
-I told them.
-Then tell me!

38:55.770 --> 38:59.453
-Kelly's got it figured pretty good.
-Listen, crap! He'll get you all killed!

38:59.453 --> 39:01.791
We're getting killed now, pal,
for $50 a month.

39:01.791 --> 39:02.686
Damn right.

39:02.686 --> 39:04.956
What good is a bonus when you're dead?

39:04.956 --> 39:08.125
The risk is the same one we've been taking
since we hit the beaches.

39:08.125 --> 39:10.430
Only then you didn't have a choice,
now you do!

39:10.430 --> 39:12.919
Three days from now
we're going back into the line.

39:12.919 --> 39:15.228
But this time we're doing it for ourselves.

39:15.938 --> 39:18.394
Kelly's even got us armor support.

39:19.875 --> 39:21.020
What armor?

39:21.020 --> 39:23.553
Three Shermans from the 321st.

39:23.553 --> 39:24.698
Who's in command?

39:24.698 --> 39:27.192
It's a top-line outfit!
I personally recommend them!

39:27.192 --> 39:31.740
You butt out! The only time you come out
of the ground is when you smell a profit.

39:31.740 --> 39:34.331
I'm coming out now
'cause Kelly has the perfect caper!

39:34.331 --> 39:37.720
For you it's a vacation. Six days
out of seven you're behind the lines.

39:37.720 --> 39:40.960
We're at the broken end of a bottle
all the time, so you butt out!

39:44.323 --> 39:45.753
Who's in command?

39:46.436 --> 39:47.582
A guy named Oddball.

39:47.582 --> 39:49.026
Oddball! He's a freak!

39:49.026 --> 39:51.067
He's got three Shermans all ready to go.

39:51.067 --> 39:53.857
What guarantee is that?
He's ready to go? He's a nut.

39:54.084 --> 39:56.473
We're all nuts or we wouldn't be here.

39:58.277 --> 40:01.178
Hey, look. Let me tell you guys something.

40:01.956 --> 40:05.273
There's certain rules and regulations
governing the fighting of a war.

40:05.273 --> 40:09.278
And the first one is that
you never stick your neck out for nobody!

40:09.278 --> 40:11.618
Unless you're some kind of a hero type.

40:11.618 --> 40:14.304
And I haven't seen any hero types
around here lately.

40:14.304 --> 40:16.348
Talking's not gonna do any good, Joe.

40:18.342 --> 40:20.230
These men are all going.

40:22.469 --> 40:23.582
Who will lead them?

40:26.630 --> 40:28.354
If you don't, I will.

40:37.415 --> 40:41.244
Just listen to Kelly for a minute, Joe.
He's got it all sewed, man.

40:41.244 --> 40:44.482
The route, the timing,
the supplies, everything.

40:45.863 --> 40:46.812
Sure.

41:08.777 --> 41:10.183
What do you say, Corporal?

41:12.681 --> 41:14.088
I don't know, Joe.

41:14.633 --> 41:18.376
I figure if I got to go, it might just as well
be this trip as the next one.

41:23.977 --> 41:24.905
Penn?

41:25.546 --> 41:26.790
I'm for it.

41:39.370 --> 41:40.548
How about it, Cowboy?

41:41.066 --> 41:43.816
I reckon I'm gonna have to go along
with it, Joe.

41:46.443 --> 41:47.687
They're all for it.

41:51.883 --> 41:54.305
What happens when Maitland finds out
we're not here?

41:54.828 --> 41:57.381
He'll figure we've been sent back
to the front lines.

41:57.612 --> 41:59.815
Man, he never knows
where we are anyway.

42:14.381 --> 42:16.967
Okay, show me what you've got.

42:27.501 --> 42:31.178
The road's 10 yards beyond those trees.
Let me look at that map, will you?

42:31.178 --> 42:33.253
What ifthey've put up road blocks?

42:33.253 --> 42:36.076
Doesn't matter. All that matters is
Mulligan being on time.

42:36.494 --> 42:39.341
Mulligan is on time!
On time and on target!

42:39.341 --> 42:40.963
He ain't ever been that yet!

42:40.963 --> 42:43.307
Well, there's always a first time.

42:43.307 --> 42:46.667
I figure the town is about
a quarter of a mile straight ahead.

42:46.667 --> 42:50.825
-What happens if it isn't there?
-It better be. I went through it last night.

42:51.054 --> 42:53.608
We've only got a few minutes left,
so let's get moving.

42:53.608 --> 42:56.296
Stick close to me.
I don't want to be waiting on anyone.

42:56.622 --> 42:57.964
We'll be there, Kelly.

42:58.287 --> 43:00.426
All right. Move out, Cowboy.

43:02.575 --> 43:04.550
That nut has got to be nuts.

43:06.894 --> 43:09.480
-Everything all right, Kelly?
-Everything's all right.

43:09.480 --> 43:12.040
You sure you got the time straight
with Mulligan?

43:12.040 --> 43:14.600
Yeah, I got the time straight with Mulligan.

43:14.600 --> 43:18.053
Whether Mulligan can tell time or not
is another question.

44:10.931 --> 44:11.879
Fire!

44:15.410 --> 44:16.359
Fire!

44:18.547 --> 44:19.408
Fire!

45:19.830 --> 45:22.383
That crazy Mulligan's dropping them
all over the place.

46:09.913 --> 46:11.156
You mother!

46:56.444 --> 46:58.200
Shut up, you pain in the ass!

47:41.855 --> 47:44.572
This man is the man I have
on my mind today!

47:44.927 --> 47:48.407
I'll tell you who he is.
This is my opposite number!

47:48.735 --> 47:51.997
General Bogel, commanding
the Second German Armored Division!

47:51.997 --> 47:55.609
When I look at that face,
I can read that character.

47:56.448 --> 47:58.072
This guy's a loser.

47:58.591 --> 48:00.697
Here I am sitting in his headquarters.

48:01.343 --> 48:03.100
I'm drinking his scotch.

48:04.448 --> 48:07.678
I've even got one of his broads
hanging around here somewhere.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.978
The guy's a born loser...

48:11.552 --> 48:14.400
...but you, gentlemen,
have not buried him yet.

48:14.753 --> 48:18.647
-You call yourselves leaders of men?
-They're putting up strong resistance.

48:18.647 --> 48:21.437
Come on, Roach.
I flew over the battlefield this morning.

48:21.437 --> 48:25.596
I could march a divisional dress parade
with band music right through their lines!

48:25.596 --> 48:26.910
What about our flanks?

48:26.910 --> 48:28.406
To hell with your flanks!

48:28.406 --> 48:31.710
How many times I have to tell you?
Forget about your flanks, will you?

48:31.710 --> 48:34.745
There's still a half a Panzer Division
between here and Nancy.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.379
Without gas, gentlemen!

48:36.962 --> 48:39.165
They're getting gas.
It's coming up at night.

48:39.649 --> 48:40.478
How?

48:40.478 --> 48:41.658
By truck.

48:42.370 --> 48:46.265
The Air Force has got my orders
to blow up every bridge in this sector!

48:46.265 --> 48:49.817
They're doing it and the Germans
are rebuilding the bridges every night.

48:49.817 --> 48:52.607
We're supposed to be blowing them up
again in the daytime.

48:52.607 --> 48:54.300
Get me those aerial photographs!

48:54.300 --> 48:55.353
Right, sir.

48:56.866 --> 49:00.215
Last night someone gave orders
to redirect our mortar fire...

49:00.215 --> 49:02.330
...against some damn crossroads.

49:02.330 --> 49:06.396
Listen, Roach. I don't want any excuses
out of you, you hear me?

49:06.787 --> 49:11.043
I want to know why this loser of a general
is keeping me the hell out of Nancy!

49:11.427 --> 49:13.118
Sir, we haven't got the supplies.

49:13.572 --> 49:15.001
It's a matter of logistics.

49:15.001 --> 49:16.319
-Logistics?
-Yes, sir.

49:16.804 --> 49:19.487
We've got logistics coming out of our ears!

49:19.487 --> 49:22.848
What we need is fighting spirit!
The will to win!

49:23.365 --> 49:25.121
Where are those aerial photographs?

49:25.508 --> 49:27.450
I'm sorry. They don't seem to be here.

49:27.716 --> 49:28.862
They don't what?

49:29.348 --> 49:30.722
I can't locate them, sir.

49:34.149 --> 49:36.603
Did you lose my aerial photographs?

49:46.661 --> 49:49.509
It looks to me
like there ain't no bridges still up.

49:50.886 --> 49:52.413
What's this here?

49:54.022 --> 49:55.396
It's a bridge.

49:55.814 --> 49:57.887
It looks like some kind of railroad bridge.

49:57.887 --> 49:58.786
Beautiful.

50:01.702 --> 50:03.525
Even if we make that...

50:03.910 --> 50:07.652
...we've still got a river to cross later on.
Right over there.

50:07.910 --> 50:11.588
Let Kelly worry about that. Our problem is
getting through German lines, right?

50:12.103 --> 50:13.085
Right.

50:13.991 --> 50:14.939
How?

50:15.207 --> 50:17.062
It's a railroad bridge, ain't it?

50:17.062 --> 50:17.890
Yeah.

50:18.119 --> 50:19.231
Then, beautiful.

50:19.231 --> 50:22.620
We swing down onto the railroad tracks
and right over the mother bridge.

50:24.136 --> 50:25.150
Sure!

50:25.799 --> 50:27.490
Suppose the bridge ain't there?

50:33.416 --> 50:36.099
Don't hit me with negative waves
so early in the morning.

50:37.416 --> 50:40.864
Think that bridge will be there
and it will be there.

50:42.441 --> 50:45.986
It's a mother, beautiful bridge
and it's gonna be there.

50:48.937 --> 50:49.864
Okay?

50:51.977 --> 50:52.926
Okay, Chief.

50:56.906 --> 50:57.953
Okay.

51:01.161 --> 51:02.110
Mount up.

51:04.809 --> 51:06.086
How many, Grace?

51:06.794 --> 51:07.776
Eight.

51:11.563 --> 51:12.839
-Penn?
-Seven.

51:19.019 --> 51:20.481
How many, Kelly?

51:22.027 --> 51:23.368
Three's fine.

51:31.371 --> 51:32.299
Cowboy?

51:32.299 --> 51:36.170
About six and I figure about eight loose.

51:37.612 --> 51:39.041
How about you, Willard?

51:39.041 --> 51:40.609
About the same.

51:47.820 --> 51:49.926
How many clips did you use last night?

51:50.317 --> 51:51.779
-About eight.
-Eight!

51:53.549 --> 51:56.484
You're trigger-happy, Gutkowski.
Here's two more.

51:56.844 --> 51:58.121
Take it easy, okay?

52:00.429 --> 52:01.540
Take it easy.

52:02.060 --> 52:03.719
Want some K rations, Crapgame?

52:03.719 --> 52:05.195
No, thanks, kid.

52:05.997 --> 52:08.332
I could use some water.
Do you got any water?

52:10.285 --> 52:12.292
I'm gonna get some water, okay, kid?

52:20.590 --> 52:22.411
Hey, who are you writing to?

52:22.411 --> 52:23.850
Your mother?

52:24.270 --> 52:25.198
Yeah.

52:26.574 --> 52:28.168
Do you write often?

52:28.751 --> 52:29.678
Yeah.

52:31.406 --> 52:32.780
Where are you from?

52:33.134 --> 52:34.476
Indianapolis.

52:37.327 --> 52:38.920
Do you miss your mother?

52:38.920 --> 52:39.919
Yeah.

52:42.639 --> 52:44.549
Good talking to you, kid.

52:56.624 --> 52:59.308
Big Joe wants to see you
over at the command jeep.

53:10.192 --> 53:11.654
Something wrong?

53:12.273 --> 53:14.412
Yeah, just a few little things, Kelly.

53:14.641 --> 53:16.234
According to this map...

53:16.234 --> 53:19.339
...we got a river to cross before we get
into this town of yours.

53:19.339 --> 53:22.508
Yeah, well, there's a bridge right here.
Six miles out.

53:22.508 --> 53:23.690
There was a bridge.

53:23.690 --> 53:26.729
The Air Corps knocked every bridge
out of that river months ago.

53:26.729 --> 53:30.795
The Air Corps knocks them out by day
and the Germans rebuild them by night.

53:31.922 --> 53:36.079
All we have to do is get there tomorrow
at dawn and we've got ourselves a bridge.

53:36.079 --> 53:37.488
How about the German Army?

53:37.488 --> 53:40.074
Do you think they'd mind us
crossing their bridge?

53:42.227 --> 53:43.307
Probably.

53:43.307 --> 53:44.970
Do you know something, Kelly?

53:44.970 --> 53:48.391
I think you're crazy.
Better yet, I think I'm crazy!

53:48.391 --> 53:50.833
How did I ever let you
talk these guys into this?

53:50.833 --> 53:54.128
Push 30 miles behind enemy lines,
take a bridge held by Germans...

53:54.128 --> 53:58.255
...then go into a town that we don't know
how many German soldiers are guarding!

53:59.251 --> 54:02.066
I figure there's between 30 and 40 troops
in that town.

54:02.066 --> 54:04.466
All right. How did you figure that?

54:04.466 --> 54:08.688
Well, it's of no military importance.
It's not big enough for a garrison.

54:08.688 --> 54:11.985
You still didn't answer the question!
How did you figure 30 or 40 men?

54:17.653 --> 54:20.882
Because that's the normal amount
of support for three Tiger tanks.

54:22.164 --> 54:23.310
Tigers?

54:24.085 --> 54:25.678
Where did the Tigers come from?

54:27.317 --> 54:29.804
That's why we have Oddball
and his Shermans.

54:29.804 --> 54:31.404
Does he know about the Tigers?

54:31.404 --> 54:32.426
Not yet.

54:32.426 --> 54:34.258
You bet your sweet ass he doesn't!

54:34.258 --> 54:36.399
Or he'd still be on that funny farm of his!

54:36.399 --> 54:40.146
He may be nuts, but he's not crazy enough
to put Shermans up against Tigers!

54:40.146 --> 54:44.142
Once these things get rolling, they'll blow
that whole town to pieces, including us!

54:44.854 --> 54:47.341
You're too smart to let that happen, Joe.

54:47.341 --> 54:49.845
You'll figure us a way in and out
of that town.

54:49.845 --> 54:51.917
I know you have a good head for tactics.

54:57.046 --> 55:00.429
And I intend to keep it right here
on my shoulders, Kelly.

55:00.429 --> 55:04.147
With these Tigers, this operation goes
above and beyond the call of duty!

55:05.912 --> 55:07.602
That's right, Joe.

55:08.279 --> 55:10.963
$16 million, above and beyond.

55:10.963 --> 55:12.370
Hey, look, Kelly.

55:12.599 --> 55:15.731
You're pressing their luck
and they've only got so much of it left.

55:15.731 --> 55:17.523
It's a long, long way to Berlin.

55:17.523 --> 55:21.105
And they'll need every inch of that luck
before this cockamamie war is over!

55:23.032 --> 55:24.015
Cover!

55:43.290 --> 55:46.672
Come on, on the double!
Let's get the equipment out of the trucks!

55:56.538 --> 55:58.710
On the double, move it out! Here.

56:02.426 --> 56:03.255
Cover!

56:03.578 --> 56:04.506
Take cover!

56:26.556 --> 56:28.116
That idiot's one of ours!

56:28.116 --> 56:29.365
Holy crap!

56:43.932 --> 56:45.045
Our hero.

56:53.438 --> 56:55.674
This is crazy, isn't it, Willard?

56:55.674 --> 56:58.741
-Anybody get the plane's number?
-Why? Who will you complain to?

56:58.741 --> 57:00.374
Move it out, move it out.

57:00.990 --> 57:03.771
-Still think we can make it, wise guy?
-We can still try.

57:03.771 --> 57:06.074
Well, Oddball better show up, Kelly.

57:06.074 --> 57:08.637
That's all I got to say, he'd better show up.

57:10.750 --> 57:11.928
Move it out!

57:15.870 --> 57:17.431
-How is it?
-Shot!

57:18.174 --> 57:21.623
-There's a hole right through the cylinder.
-How about the radio equipment?

57:22.271 --> 57:24.343
The pack radio is okay,
but the rest has had it.

57:24.343 --> 57:26.041
Pick it up and take it with you.

57:26.041 --> 57:27.540
I got your equipment, Joe.

57:27.540 --> 57:28.792
Bring it.

57:30.272 --> 57:32.889
I told you! We should've never gone in
on this deal.

57:33.599 --> 57:35.225
Well, you never told me!

57:35.487 --> 57:36.665
Yes, I did.

57:38.527 --> 57:41.397
Is this why we pay taxes?
To be bombed by our own Air Force?

57:41.397 --> 57:42.616
Damn right!

57:45.152 --> 57:46.396
What do we do now?

57:46.396 --> 57:50.207
Pick up our equipment and get out of here
before a German patrol comes along.

57:51.489 --> 57:52.895
That's great.

57:53.440 --> 57:55.807
Let's move the stuff up to the wall,
on the double!

57:56.129 --> 57:57.820
-Everybody all right?
-I think so.

57:57.820 --> 57:59.099
What happened, Joe?

57:59.745 --> 58:02.297
-Where the hell have you been?
-I had to go.

58:02.297 --> 58:03.645
We all have to go!

58:03.645 --> 58:07.640
Come on! We've got 20 miles to walk
and 9 hours to walk it in, so move it out!

58:07.873 --> 58:08.734
Big Joe?

58:08.734 --> 58:12.827
Must I carry all this equipment, the satchel
and the .30 caliber machine gun?

58:13.730 --> 58:15.519
Give the .30 caliber to the Hustler.

58:15.519 --> 58:17.375
He wants to be a hero.

58:21.410 --> 58:22.937
Here you are, old buddy.

58:24.482 --> 58:26.904
Thanks! Get yourself a bucket of grits!

58:32.738 --> 58:34.877
All right, Corporal, let's go.
Move them out!

58:34.877 --> 58:36.835
Move it out, Penn!

58:36.835 --> 58:38.241
It's a long way.

58:39.203 --> 58:40.381
Move it out!

58:40.381 --> 58:41.793
Kelly, get on the point.

58:43.683 --> 58:45.658
Why did you get me elected to carry this?

58:45.658 --> 58:48.579
You wanted in on this?
Then learn to carry your own load.

58:48.579 --> 58:50.368
Come on, move it out!

58:50.787 --> 58:52.216
Yeah, up yours!

59:26.182 --> 59:29.859
Take it easy, take it easy. Take it easy.
Okay, hold it. Hold it!

59:34.438 --> 59:37.188
It looks like we've got
a military installation up ahead.

59:37.188 --> 59:40.735
So, make it the same deal as before.
We'll go into a triangular formation.

59:40.735 --> 59:43.970
I'll go down the slot.
Moe, you go down the right flank.

59:43.970 --> 59:45.981
Whiskey, down the left. Keep it tight.

59:45.981 --> 59:49.632
Don't break it up until I give you the word.
Okay, button up and let's go.

01:00:27.114 --> 01:00:27.877
Fire!

01:00:51.306 --> 01:00:52.070
Fire!

01:01:01.259 --> 01:01:02.022
Hit it!

01:01:10.411 --> 01:01:12.713
All right, lay four rounds in there heavy!

01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:17.217
Come on, move it! Move it!

01:01:38.509 --> 01:01:39.338
Hit it!

01:01:42.318 --> 01:01:43.081
Fire!

01:01:45.997 --> 01:01:46.925
Fire!

01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:54.412
Bring it around, Howard!

01:02:06.702 --> 01:02:07.466
Hit it!

01:03:15.602 --> 01:03:17.707
-All right, let's go, Petuko.
-Right, Joe.

01:03:17.707 --> 01:03:19.567
Move them out, Corporal.

01:03:19.567 --> 01:03:20.944
Let's go, Babra.

01:03:21.491 --> 01:03:23.345
Wake up, Gutkowski. Let's go.

01:03:26.195 --> 01:03:27.886
All right, Hustler, let's go.

01:03:30.132 --> 01:03:33.928
This was your idea. How come
we don't go back to our own lines?

01:03:34.515 --> 01:03:36.971
It's further back
than it is to where we're going.

01:03:36.971 --> 01:03:39.793
I know what. Let's surrender, I'm hungry.

01:03:41.588 --> 01:03:43.343
All right! I buy it.

01:03:43.343 --> 01:03:45.680
I'll make you $50
if you carry the machine gun.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.860
You got it on you?

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.168
-Don't you trust me?
-No, I don't.

01:03:49.168 --> 01:03:52.139
What do you think I am, a vault?
You think I carry money on me?

01:03:52.139 --> 01:03:54.482
I ask you a favor
and you don't want to help me?

01:03:54.482 --> 01:03:57.746
All I asked you to do is carry
the machine gun. I'll give you $100.

01:03:57.746 --> 01:03:59.755
-Do you have it?
-I don't have it on me!

01:03:59.755 --> 01:04:01.651
Shut up!

01:04:02.325 --> 01:04:04.016
You guys keep quiet.

01:04:11.006 --> 01:04:12.282
It's still up.

01:04:29.312 --> 01:04:30.654
No, it ain't.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.109
You see what sending out
them negative waves did, Moriarty?

01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:39.965
That ain't my fault, Oddball.

01:04:39.965 --> 01:04:43.674
I've had nothing but good thoughts
about that damn bridge ever since we left!

01:04:43.674 --> 01:04:45.272
What happens now?

01:04:46.848 --> 01:04:49.631
It looks like we're gonna find ourselves
another bridge.

01:04:50.049 --> 01:04:52.285
Where are we gonna come up
with another bridge?

01:04:52.285 --> 01:04:56.442
There you go, more negative waves!
Have a little faith, baby.

01:04:57.025 --> 01:04:58.717
Have a little faith.

01:05:01.153 --> 01:05:03.608
Now go on, get down into your hole.

01:05:04.098 --> 01:05:05.210
Move out!

01:05:20.706 --> 01:05:23.903
42nd Engineers. Bridging Unit.
Corporal Roamer speaking.

01:05:26.403 --> 01:05:27.296
Hey, Sarge?

01:05:28.739 --> 01:05:29.916
It's Oddball!

01:05:40.195 --> 01:05:43.294
Don't try to be funny, Oddball!
What do you want?

01:05:44.131 --> 01:05:48.540
I'm calling you from a café
about 10 miles south of Mesurier.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.499
I wondered if you could do me a favor?

01:05:50.755 --> 01:05:51.966
Mesurier?

01:05:52.452 --> 01:05:56.446
I got a map here someplace that says
we haven't even captured that place yet!

01:05:56.446 --> 01:05:59.710
Yeah, so I heard.
Everybody seems very friendly.

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:02.876
Look, baby, I'm kind of hung up.
I need about 60 feet of bridge.

01:06:03.236 --> 01:06:07.099
How am I supposed to get 60 feet of bridge
10 miles behind the German lines?

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:11.163
I'm about to put you onto something good
and you are giving me your problems.

01:06:11.163 --> 01:06:15.230
This sector's so screwed up, nobody knows
where the German lines or our lines are.

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.829
I got through with no problem.

01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:20.698
I've got a bank back here with $16 million
waiting to be picked up. Are you in?

01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:24.128
They haven't got you back
in the nut ward again, have they?

01:06:24.128 --> 01:06:25.725
Bellamy! For crying out loud!

01:06:25.725 --> 01:06:28.449
That is the lousiest, stinking,
most awful, stupid joke!

01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:31.136
You're always pulling
that stinking, awful, stupid joke!

01:06:31.136 --> 01:06:34.622
You don't want in this thing, don't get in!
I cut you out of everything!

01:06:34.622 --> 01:06:38.404
I don't need you. 60 feet of bridge,
I can pick up almost anywhere! Shmuck!

01:06:38.404 --> 01:06:39.899
All right, all right!

01:06:39.899 --> 01:06:44.066
Look, with three tanks, it's easy.
With a 60-foot bridge it's something else!

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:47.932
I need support units, Oddball.
I need at least 100 guys!

01:06:47.932 --> 01:06:50.756
Where do I find 100 men, just like that?

01:07:17.961 --> 01:07:19.685
Eighteen miles to....

01:07:20.969 --> 01:07:21.984
Jerks!

01:07:51.691 --> 01:07:52.639
Shut up!

01:07:55.019 --> 01:07:57.026
We've walked into a minefield.

01:07:59.979 --> 01:08:01.354
All right, who bought it?

01:08:01.354 --> 01:08:02.368
It's Grace!

01:08:06.347 --> 01:08:08.933
There's a road right up here
at the edge of the field.

01:08:09.804 --> 01:08:11.976
Mark that spot and head for the road.

01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:13.833
Everybody!

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.754
Take out your bayonets...

01:08:16.555 --> 01:08:18.018
...and move towards Kelly!

01:08:18.348 --> 01:08:19.296
Corporal!

01:08:19.564 --> 01:08:21.452
Move the men down slowly!

01:08:21.901 --> 01:08:23.242
Mitchell?

01:08:23.469 --> 01:08:26.185
You pick up Grace's B.A.R.
and head this way!

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.554
Jonesy, for Christ's sake stand still!

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.076
Corporal?

01:08:31.469 --> 01:08:35.211
Go see if Grace is still alive.
Jonesy, will you get the hell down?

01:09:34.608 --> 01:09:35.950
Looks all right up here.

01:09:37.712 --> 01:09:40.615
All right, you guys, keep it moving!
Stay careful.

01:09:46.993 --> 01:09:48.138
Hey, I found one!

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:52.136
What kind is it?

01:09:53.265 --> 01:09:56.299
The kind that blows up!
How the hell do I know what kind it is?

01:09:56.299 --> 01:09:58.541
Mark the spot and keep moving, Hustler.

01:09:59.154 --> 01:10:00.496
I'll mark it!

01:10:16.147 --> 01:10:19.562
Gutkowski, get down there on that bend
and keep an eye out.

01:10:38.965 --> 01:10:40.787
Okay, bring the B.A.R.

01:11:19.287 --> 01:11:22.320
Penn, get that .30 caliber set up
the other side of the wall.

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:27.217
I could've been in the States
playing ping-pong, volleyball...

01:11:27.543 --> 01:11:29.103
...plenty of broads.

01:11:30.614 --> 01:11:32.469
Who the hell needs all this?

01:11:32.469 --> 01:11:35.284
I'm gonna get my knife
and get the hell out of here.

01:11:36.471 --> 01:11:37.715
Lousy equipment.

01:11:38.168 --> 01:11:39.923
Now I got to lift up this cannon.

01:11:40.503 --> 01:11:43.439
Carry it all the way
to the front line someplace.

01:11:43.703 --> 01:11:46.606
The damn thing is heavier
than Kelsey's burgers.

01:11:47.608 --> 01:11:50.510
Sure, I'll get a rupture yet
with this damn thing.

01:12:00.536 --> 01:12:01.649
Move it now!

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:04.374
On the double, across the road.

01:12:04.985 --> 01:12:06.895
Stay on Kelly's path all the way!

01:12:06.895 --> 01:12:07.982
On the double!

01:12:09.561 --> 01:12:12.529
Come on, Hustler. Move it, move it.
It's all safe for you, now.

01:12:12.529 --> 01:12:15.471
I hope you have to take the gas pipe!
You creep!

01:12:15.471 --> 01:12:17.455
-All the way, you jerk!
-Go to hell!

01:12:17.978 --> 01:12:19.384
Let's go, Cowboy! Move it!

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:21.552
Come on, Willard. Let's mount up, boy.

01:12:21.552 --> 01:12:23.481
Anything we can do for you, Corporal?

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:25.201
No, thanks. We're all right.

01:12:25.434 --> 01:12:27.823
-Come on, Willard. Hit it, boy.
-I'm ready.

01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:34.618
How did we get talked into this mess?

01:12:34.618 --> 01:12:36.854
It took 10 seconds to talk you into this.

01:12:37.115 --> 01:12:40.944
But we were supposed to ride, not walk.
Nobody said anything about mines...

01:12:40.944 --> 01:12:43.539
...or shlepping this machine gun
all over the country!

01:12:43.539 --> 01:12:47.060
Quit your bitching and just remember
what's at the end of the line.

01:12:48.347 --> 01:12:49.329
Kelly!

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.364
There's a patrol coming in.

01:12:57.364 --> 01:12:59.671
All right! Spread them out
across the road!

01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:01.912
Move it! Your crabs will leave you now!

01:13:02.588 --> 01:13:05.076
Get that gun set up
on the other side of the wall.

01:13:08.956 --> 01:13:09.905
Move!

01:13:11.036 --> 01:13:12.695
Move it, Petuko, move it!

01:13:12.695 --> 01:13:15.512
-Don't forget about the broads!
-You horny bastard!

01:13:27.965 --> 01:13:29.624
Get the hell out of there!

01:13:31.677 --> 01:13:34.492
You'll never make it!
We'll cover you from the road.

01:13:34.492 --> 01:13:37.557
-Don't move unless they spot you.
-Right! Go on.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:42.552
Set up the B.A.R. there.

01:13:55.071 --> 01:13:57.918
All right, stay down and load up.
Stay down, load up!

01:14:02.432 --> 01:14:03.479
Stay down.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.375
Stay down, hold your fire.

01:14:11.936 --> 01:14:13.049
Grenades.

01:14:28.128 --> 01:14:31.063
-Let's get out of here. Let's go back.
-Take it easy.

01:14:31.553 --> 01:14:34.139
It's too late, now.
We're better off here, anyway.

01:14:34.433 --> 01:14:36.058
Get your head down.

01:15:06.722 --> 01:15:08.097
Nice and easy.

01:15:35.013 --> 01:15:36.190
Stay down.

01:16:08.582 --> 01:16:09.662
All right.

01:16:10.503 --> 01:16:11.299
Get ready.

01:16:17.255 --> 01:16:18.204
Hold it.

01:16:19.815 --> 01:16:20.447
Fire!

01:17:05.737 --> 01:17:06.850
Let's go!

01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:28.480
Jam!

01:17:28.779 --> 01:17:29.892
Clear it!

01:19:02.416 --> 01:19:03.910
Let's move it out.

01:19:07.696 --> 01:19:10.184
All right, you heard me!
I said, move it out!

01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:16.521
Maybe they're only wounded.

01:19:16.913 --> 01:19:19.018
They're dead, so forget it. Let's move.

01:20:17.556 --> 01:20:20.240
There's a whole column
of Shermans coming over the hill!

01:20:22.228 --> 01:20:24.946
Take it easy. Go get your packs!
Pick up your equipment!

01:20:35.637 --> 01:20:37.546
Go on down and load up.

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:40.650
Ready!

01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:44.118
Fire!

01:20:52.727 --> 01:20:55.181
I thought you said three Shermans.

01:20:55.181 --> 01:20:57.619
Those nuts have brought halfthe Army
with them!

01:21:05.398 --> 01:21:08.977
Okay, keep a move on.
Let's keep on coming.

01:21:09.335 --> 01:21:11.702
Come on. Okay, move.

01:21:21.912 --> 01:21:23.800
Are you ready for this?

01:21:24.057 --> 01:21:25.965
Split how many ways, stupid?

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.655
Come on, Willard!

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.998
What is this? What is this, a ball game?
Who are these guys?

01:21:38.998 --> 01:21:40.656
They're my friends, Crapgame.

01:21:40.656 --> 01:21:42.387
Friends? Where'd you find them?

01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:44.047
Here and there.

01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:46.639
There's a bunch of refugees over there!

01:21:46.639 --> 01:21:48.022
It's a band.

01:21:48.345 --> 01:21:50.385
A band? What do we need a band for?

01:21:51.194 --> 01:21:54.292
Have a little faith, Crapgame.
They're beautiful people.

01:21:55.673 --> 01:21:59.154
Kid, pull yourselftogether.
We ain't in the middle of Central Park!

01:21:59.154 --> 01:22:00.339
Oddball!

01:22:00.795 --> 01:22:04.689
How do you figure on moving through
enemy terrain with a column a mile long?

01:22:04.689 --> 01:22:07.664
Easy. We can fight. We got an army.

01:22:07.963 --> 01:22:10.930
Those freaks! That ain't an army,
it's a circus!

01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:14.806
Take it easy, Big Joe.

01:22:14.806 --> 01:22:17.589
Some of these people
have got sensitive feelings.

01:22:18.171 --> 01:22:19.513
Who's the guy in charge?

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:20.827
I am.

01:22:20.827 --> 01:22:22.677
What's the deal with the gold?

01:22:23.098 --> 01:22:26.230
Any man who gets to the town
and hits the bank, gets an equal share.

01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:28.885
But don't try to cross us.
There's gonna be trouble.

01:22:28.885 --> 01:22:30.516
Who's gonna make it, boy?

01:22:30.516 --> 01:22:31.351
I am!

01:22:31.351 --> 01:22:32.630
Get out and start it!

01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:34.106
Take it easy, big mouth.

01:22:34.459 --> 01:22:36.947
You get out of here.
Everybody else up on the tanks.

01:22:36.947 --> 01:22:38.002
Let's move out!

01:22:38.002 --> 01:22:39.320
Don't double-cross us!

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.071
-Any double-crossing will be your fat lip!
-Get moving.

01:22:42.071 --> 01:22:43.088
Shut up!

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:45.333
Everybody up on that tank. Let's go!

01:22:51.517 --> 01:22:53.688
We're not going
with those cowboys, are we?

01:22:53.688 --> 01:22:57.620
We've got $16 million up for grabs
and we won't let those clods beat us to it.

01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:59.003
Now, let's get moving.

01:23:21.918 --> 01:23:23.511
I say, Booker?

01:23:25.983 --> 01:23:27.096
Yes, sir?

01:23:27.096 --> 01:23:29.597
The old man was just on the line!

01:23:29.824 --> 01:23:32.856
He says I've broken through
a long and entire front!

01:23:32.856 --> 01:23:34.171
Why wasn't I told?

01:23:34.559 --> 01:23:35.606
I don't know, sir.

01:23:36.031 --> 01:23:38.366
You're the Communications Officer!

01:23:38.366 --> 01:23:40.503
You're supposed to be able
to communicate!

01:23:40.767 --> 01:23:43.353
Who's broken through
and how far have they gone?

01:23:43.353 --> 01:23:44.918
Well, no one has, sir.

01:23:44.918 --> 01:23:47.643
It seems someone's found a hole
in the right flank.

01:23:47.643 --> 01:23:51.192
They're trying to push elements
of the 321st and the 35th into it.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:54.458
"Seems," Booker?
"Elements of the 321st and 35th"?

01:23:54.945 --> 01:23:57.628
Who's pushing them in there,
and where the hell are they?

01:23:58.081 --> 01:23:59.194
I don't know, sir.

01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:01.788
I'm coming down there, Booker!

01:24:01.788 --> 01:24:05.240
What's the use of a communications officer
who can't communicate?

01:24:05.825 --> 01:24:08.443
Communication?
He's more like a damn military censor!

01:24:08.834 --> 01:24:10.906
I'm back from Paris. I got everything.

01:24:10.906 --> 01:24:13.727
All I want is to know
whether we have broken through or not!

01:24:13.727 --> 01:24:16.794
It's hard to say for certain, sir.
Nothing's been confirmed yet.

01:24:17.185 --> 01:24:21.113
We've intercepted some signals
that suggest some action at a bridge...

01:24:21.113 --> 01:24:22.559
...near Clermont.

01:24:22.559 --> 01:24:24.379
Is that Clermont, Booker?

01:24:24.706 --> 01:24:25.470
Yes, sir.

01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:27.480
Then why in the hell didn't you say so?

01:24:27.906 --> 01:24:31.451
That's 30 miles beyond their lines!
You got them on the radio?

01:24:31.451 --> 01:24:32.544
Yes, sir.

01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:35.640
It's hard to pick them up clearly
at this time in the morning.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.406
It has to do with the ionosphere.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:40.409
Get the ionosphere the hell offthe air
and get them on!

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.872
Get out of there, Soldier.
Do something else.

01:24:42.872 --> 01:24:45.500
-What's the frequency?
-300 kc, sir.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:49.597
You won't find them easy to follow.
They're using some kind of code.

01:24:50.339 --> 01:24:51.135
What code?

01:24:51.135 --> 01:24:53.440
Words like "bank heist,
Crapgame, Big Joe...

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.937
"...Little Joe, Oddball--"

01:24:55.268 --> 01:24:57.690
Can anybody get rid of
that machine gun for me.

01:24:57.690 --> 01:25:00.316
-Yes, sir, there! That's it, that's them!
-Where?

01:25:00.316 --> 01:25:02.755
There! Right on 300, sir. Right there.

01:25:04.004 --> 01:25:07.267
There they are, sir. Those are the signals
we've been picking up.

01:25:07.267 --> 01:25:10.529
Will you shut up and let me try and listen
to what they're saying?

01:25:12.453 --> 01:25:14.079
Oddball, this Kelly.

01:25:14.079 --> 01:25:17.051
Kelly, what the hell's going on
out there, man?

01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:20.474
It's cleared ofinfantry. What doyou hear
from those other two tanks?

01:25:20.965 --> 01:25:25.308
No chance, man. They've both had it.
One's in the river, the other's burning.

01:25:26.150 --> 01:25:28.037
Yeah, I can see them from here. Over.

01:25:29.701 --> 01:25:30.748
Where's Big Joe?

01:25:31.046 --> 01:25:34.112
On the other side. Get offthe line,
I'll get in touch with him.

01:25:34.566 --> 01:25:35.515
Fire!

01:25:36.199 --> 01:25:37.343
Okay. Over and out.

01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:41.052
Kelly to Big Joe. Kelly to Big Joe. Over.

01:25:41.415 --> 01:25:43.782
Kelly, it's Crapgame.
What's happening over there?

01:25:44.358 --> 01:25:47.653
They're dropping artillery
all over the place! That's what.

01:25:47.653 --> 01:25:48.928
Where's Big Joe?

01:25:49.383 --> 01:25:51.750
He's not here. He's pinned down
under the bridge.

01:25:52.295 --> 01:25:54.084
Well, get him for me! Over.

01:25:54.663 --> 01:25:57.892
Damn! Are we losing them?
We just had them good a minute ago!

01:25:57.892 --> 01:25:59.650
I'm doing it, Booker!

01:26:00.551 --> 01:26:01.534
Quiet!

01:26:01.534 --> 01:26:03.299
What should I do with this?

01:26:03.299 --> 01:26:06.019
Get the hell out of here!
We've got the game on!

01:26:17.128 --> 01:26:18.437
Kelly, this Big Joe.

01:26:18.952 --> 01:26:21.604
It's pretty clear over here,
except for the artillery.

01:26:21.604 --> 01:26:25.285
The bridge is too far gone for vehicles.
You can bring the men over by foot.

01:26:25.737 --> 01:26:27.460
Get them moving.

01:26:27.752 --> 01:26:30.600
Okay, I'll send them over
in twos and threes. Out.

01:26:30.953 --> 01:26:34.434
Petuko, Willard! Drop your packs
and take the equipment across the bridge.

01:26:36.777 --> 01:26:38.981
Kelly, what did Big Joe say?

01:26:40.105 --> 01:26:41.633
Says he's sending them across.

01:26:41.994 --> 01:26:44.864
Tell him to hurry up.
It's getting hotter than hell in here!

01:26:48.042 --> 01:26:49.952
-What's going on?
-We're crossing over.

01:26:49.952 --> 01:26:53.604
-You're not crossing over without us!
-Then grab your trucks and come on up.

01:26:53.604 --> 01:26:55.364
The bridge is too badly damaged.

01:26:55.364 --> 01:26:56.809
You want to come, fix it.

01:26:56.809 --> 01:26:59.110
Half my equipment's jammed up
in the rear!

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:00.488
Un-jam them!

01:27:00.488 --> 01:27:03.686
We've lost two tanks already!
I won't stick around to lose a third!

01:27:03.686 --> 01:27:05.249
Listen, we made a deal!

01:27:05.249 --> 01:27:07.843
Not with me, you didn't.
Here! You talk to Kelly.

01:27:07.843 --> 01:27:09.344
Cowboy, stay with the truck.

01:27:09.344 --> 01:27:10.248
Ready?

01:27:10.955 --> 01:27:12.777
This is Bellamy for Kelly!

01:27:13.835 --> 01:27:16.769
We can't use the bridge.
We can't ford the river.

01:27:16.769 --> 01:27:17.858
So what do we do?

01:27:17.858 --> 01:27:19.208
Go team go. Go!

01:27:19.208 --> 01:27:21.380
You've got bridging equipment. Over.

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:25.314
That's a five-hour operation.
Can you hold on for five hours? Over.

01:27:25.314 --> 01:27:27.624
No, no! Move! On, on! Move!

01:27:27.916 --> 01:27:31.146
We're not gonna hold on for five minutes.
You can catch up.

01:27:31.405 --> 01:27:34.917
Kelly, we're all in this together.
You can't go it alone! Over!

01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:39.109
We're not gonna wait five hours, either.
If you can't keep up, that's your problem.

01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:41.831
We're pulling out
and we're pushing forward! Over!

01:27:41.831 --> 01:27:43.362
Attack! Attack! Attack!

01:27:43.362 --> 01:27:46.981
That's fighting spirit I was talking about!
Listen to that guy!

01:27:46.981 --> 01:27:48.963
If he was a major, he's a colonel now!

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:53.543
This the Grave Diggers Registration Unit.
We got a stake in this advance, too.

01:27:53.543 --> 01:27:56.231
Did you ever hear enthusiasm like that
in all your life?

01:27:56.231 --> 01:28:00.230
They've even got the damn Grave Diggers!
What the hell am I doing here?

01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:02.954
Bonsor! Get me my uniform!

01:28:03.502 --> 01:28:05.291
-Get on!
-I wonder where Cowboy is?

01:28:05.291 --> 01:28:06.699
Give me that gun!

01:28:07.183 --> 01:28:08.492
Pick up that radio!

01:28:09.039 --> 01:28:10.216
Faster, faster!

01:28:10.927 --> 01:28:13.033
Hurry up you guys!
We haven't got much time!

01:28:13.033 --> 01:28:13.931
Get up!

01:28:13.931 --> 01:28:15.787
Crapgame, do you like the Army?

01:28:16.303 --> 01:28:18.026
Let's go! Let's get out of here!

01:28:19.568 --> 01:28:21.161
All right, let's move them out!

01:28:23.471 --> 01:28:26.854
-This is it, Penn. We're on our way, baby.
-Cowboy, come on! Hurry up!

01:28:27.119 --> 01:28:28.068
Here we go!

01:28:29.327 --> 01:28:32.590
-Come on, Cowboy! This train's leaving.
-Give me your hand.

01:28:32.879 --> 01:28:34.789
Somebody grab that radio.

01:28:35.664 --> 01:28:37.835
There you go! Come on, up, up!

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.390
That a boy, come on!

01:28:41.777 --> 01:28:42.758
That's it.

01:28:48.241 --> 01:28:51.624
Booker, tell General Castle
that I want every man in this Army...

01:28:51.624 --> 01:28:53.290
...on the road within the hour.

01:28:53.809 --> 01:28:55.238
I'm pushing on to the Rhine.

01:28:55.505 --> 01:28:58.091
But, sir, Clermont's 30 miles
behind enemy lines.

01:28:58.353 --> 01:28:59.466
That you, Maitland?

01:29:00.561 --> 01:29:01.902
Just back from Paris, sir.

01:29:01.902 --> 01:29:03.953
Get my vehicle and driver around here.

01:29:03.953 --> 01:29:05.905
You get my box of medals.

01:29:05.905 --> 01:29:09.036
I'll decorate every man in this penetration,
whoever they are.

01:29:09.036 --> 01:29:11.473
They've saved the reputation
of this entire Army.

01:29:11.473 --> 01:29:14.920
You're supposed to fight this battle
and you don't even know where it is!

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:18.344
I'll tell you where it is! It's 30 miles
beyond where you thought it was!

01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:22.159
Come on, let's get this Army of mine
back in the war!

01:29:22.159 --> 01:29:23.437
Will you send that?

01:30:14.006 --> 01:30:16.308
Shouldn't you wait for the Army
to get ahead of you?

01:30:16.308 --> 01:30:17.901
History waits for no man.

01:30:17.901 --> 01:30:20.210
I have an appointment with destiny
in Clermont.

01:30:20.210 --> 01:30:21.739
Take this weapon, Maitland.

01:30:21.739 --> 01:30:23.723
All right, boy! Make this thing fly.

01:30:23.723 --> 01:30:26.034
-General, your medals.
-Good luck, sir.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.487
We're in the bell tower of the church.

01:31:10.905 --> 01:31:13.775
You can see the whole town
from up here almost.

01:31:13.775 --> 01:31:16.238
There's not much happening.
They're still asleep.

01:31:16.761 --> 01:31:20.077
There's three Tigers in the square
right down below us.

01:31:20.857 --> 01:31:23.760
Do you see anything
that looks like it might be a bank?

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.584
It's got to be this building right here
to the right ofus.

01:31:26.584 --> 01:31:28.372
Canyou see it from where you are?

01:31:28.372 --> 01:31:30.995
They've got two machine guns
and guards on the roof.

01:31:32.762 --> 01:31:36.756
I don't think I can see much
of the center of town from up here.

01:31:37.882 --> 01:31:41.744
No, just a lot of roof tops
and bombed out buildings.

01:31:45.019 --> 01:31:48.280
Beside the tanks, can you see anything
that might house support units?

01:31:48.986 --> 01:31:52.532
There's a big brown building
right behind the bank with a jeep...

01:31:52.891 --> 01:31:55.412
...and two guards and about three trucks.

01:31:56.251 --> 01:31:57.330
Hold it!

01:32:02.075 --> 01:32:06.419
There's a German officer walking around
the bank towards the brown building.

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:07.892
What doyou think?

01:32:07.892 --> 01:32:10.485
We shouldn't have trouble
unless it's with the Tigers.

01:32:10.485 --> 01:32:13.174
We can take the machine gunners
on the rooffrom here...

01:32:13.174 --> 01:32:15.284
...ifyou can keep them busy for a while.

01:32:15.284 --> 01:32:17.974
Or maybe we can go down
and get a closer look.

01:32:17.974 --> 01:32:19.735
No, stay there. Keep an eye out.

01:32:19.735 --> 01:32:22.521
See if you can find out
where those troops are housed.

01:32:24.285 --> 01:32:25.977
Well, what do you think, Oddball?

01:32:25.977 --> 01:32:30.006
It's a wasted trip. Nobody said anything
about locking horns with Tigers.

01:32:30.006 --> 01:32:33.820
Look. You just keep those Tigers busy,
and we'll take care of the rest.

01:32:34.078 --> 01:32:37.972
The only way I got to keep the Tigers busy
is to let them shoot holes in me.

01:32:38.717 --> 01:32:41.206
We just want you to keep them interested
for a while.

01:32:41.534 --> 01:32:43.836
Oh, man! You guys are crazy!

01:32:43.836 --> 01:32:47.063
When we was in the bocage country,
we was assaulted by them Tigers!

01:32:47.063 --> 01:32:49.949
You know what I mean by "assaulted"?
Well, I mean assaulted!

01:32:49.949 --> 01:32:52.884
Why don't you knock it off
with them negative waves?

01:32:53.694 --> 01:32:56.596
Why don't you dig
how beautiful it is out here?

01:32:56.927 --> 01:33:01.051
Why don't you say something righteous
and hopeful for a change?

01:33:02.207 --> 01:33:03.135
Crap!

01:33:03.648 --> 01:33:06.778
All right, so it's a beautiful day.
Now, let's get down to cases.

01:33:07.134 --> 01:33:09.022
The Tiger is an open-country tank.

01:33:10.143 --> 01:33:13.624
We happen to have these and a small town
with narrow streets.

01:33:13.624 --> 01:33:15.735
And we do have the element of surprise.

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:21.469
A Tiger has only one weak point.
That's its ass.

01:33:21.469 --> 01:33:24.861
You've got to hit it point blank
and you've got to hit it from behind.

01:33:24.861 --> 01:33:26.815
We don't have the element of surprise.

01:33:26.815 --> 01:33:31.005
They will hear our Detroit motors
long before we even get inside that town.

01:33:33.409 --> 01:33:36.791
What if I can show you a way to get
into that town so they don't hear you?

01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:40.031
Hey, Oddball?

01:33:40.641 --> 01:33:43.576
This is your hour of glory,
and you're chickening out.

01:33:45.153 --> 01:33:48.666
To a New Yorker like you,
a hero is some type of weird sandwich.

01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:51.255
Not some nut who takes on three Tigers!

01:33:52.002 --> 01:33:53.693
Nobody's asking you to be a hero.

01:33:53.693 --> 01:33:54.590
No?

01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:56.673
Then you sit up in that turret, baby.

01:33:56.898 --> 01:33:58.873
No. 'Cause you'll be up there, baby.

01:33:58.873 --> 01:34:01.467
And I'll be right outside
showing you which way to go.

01:34:03.426 --> 01:34:04.287
Yeah?

01:34:04.642 --> 01:34:05.503
Yeah.

01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:11.906
Crazy. I mean, so many positive waves,
maybe we can't lose. You're on.

01:34:20.707 --> 01:34:21.787
You got anything?

01:34:22.596 --> 01:34:23.773
No, not much.

01:34:23.773 --> 01:34:27.356
They just keep coming and going
from the brown building behind the bank.

01:34:28.708 --> 01:34:29.984
-Cowboy?
-Yeah?

01:34:29.984 --> 01:34:32.093
In 20 minutes, start ringing that bell.

01:34:32.093 --> 01:34:34.433
Keep ringing it as long as you can. Got it?

01:34:34.433 --> 01:34:35.514
Right, Kelly.

01:34:35.514 --> 01:34:39.582
Gutkowski, five minutes afterwards,
get the guards on top of the bank.

01:34:39.582 --> 01:34:40.602
Okay, Kelly.

01:34:44.868 --> 01:34:46.362
All right, let's move out.

01:36:39.882 --> 01:36:41.770
-Hold it!
-Hold it!

01:36:51.115 --> 01:36:53.352
Kelly, where in the heck are you, man?

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:56.228
We're just outside of town.
How's it look up there?

01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:59.333
Well, it doesn't look too good from here.

01:36:59.333 --> 01:37:01.738
They've got all those Tigers fired up
down there.

01:37:01.738 --> 01:37:04.554
Looks like they're getting ready
for some heavy duty action.

01:37:04.844 --> 01:37:07.179
I think we ought to pull out ofhere, pal.

01:37:07.179 --> 01:37:08.771
No, stay right there.

01:37:09.836 --> 01:37:10.981
That's just routine.

01:37:10.981 --> 01:37:14.402
The Tigers turn their engines over
for 20 minutes every three, four hours.

01:37:15.405 --> 01:37:17.096
Just routine, Cowboy. Stay put.

01:37:17.581 --> 01:37:19.075
Routine?

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.276
Boy, I sure hope you're right, Kelly.

01:37:22.477 --> 01:37:26.056
'Cause our asses will be hanging out
up here if you ain't. I'm not kidding.

01:37:26.056 --> 01:37:29.517
Nothing's gonna be hanging out.
Now, just relax. Out.

01:37:30.638 --> 01:37:32.493
Sure you're right about those Tigers?

01:37:32.493 --> 01:37:33.702
Sure, I'm right.

01:37:33.702 --> 01:37:37.419
Ifthose engines are turning over,
we can sneak right up the edge of town.

01:37:37.419 --> 01:37:38.663
Nobody would hear us.

01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:40.139
Right.

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:41.701
Shall I move out?

01:37:42.574 --> 01:37:43.305
Good man.

01:37:44.175 --> 01:37:45.288
Move out!

01:38:16.465 --> 01:38:17.446
Babra!

01:39:40.469 --> 01:39:41.549
Come on.

01:39:56.437 --> 01:39:57.485
Hold it!

01:40:02.711 --> 01:40:04.849
Stay here, until I signal you.

01:43:28.738 --> 01:43:30.265
I'm mounting up, partner.

01:43:30.529 --> 01:43:33.399
Don't you get lonely up here
without me now, you hear?

01:45:50.889 --> 01:45:53.257
All right, let's go!
Switch it on and move it out!

01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:46.121
Hold it!

01:46:46.121 --> 01:46:47.399
Hold it!

01:46:59.374 --> 01:47:00.934
Give me that hand radio.

01:47:19.247 --> 01:47:21.702
The bell's making so much noise,
he can't hear us.

01:47:21.702 --> 01:47:23.694
I thought that was what you wanted!

01:47:23.694 --> 01:47:27.304
So the Germans can't hear us.
Now, move them out. Slow.

01:47:28.048 --> 01:47:29.324
Move out! Slow!

01:48:10.642 --> 01:48:11.535
Now!

01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:38.157
Hold it! Hold it!

01:49:20.885 --> 01:49:21.965
Hold it!

01:49:43.638 --> 01:49:46.541
It's a mark six. And we got it by the ass.

01:50:30.137 --> 01:50:30.769
Fire!

01:51:23.132 --> 01:51:24.180
Stay down.

01:51:50.653 --> 01:51:52.180
All right, move out!

01:52:10.687 --> 01:52:11.636
Let's go!

01:52:23.872 --> 01:52:25.365
All right, get out of here.

01:52:25.791 --> 01:52:26.904
Move out!

01:53:33.443 --> 01:53:34.555
Crapgame?

01:54:05.285 --> 01:54:06.398
Over there.

01:54:07.174 --> 01:54:08.384
Come on, you idiot.

01:54:18.278 --> 01:54:20.766
Will you knock it off
with those cockamamie bells?

01:54:20.766 --> 01:54:22.266
Kelly told me to ring them.

01:54:22.266 --> 01:54:25.189
I know, but they know we're here already.
So, knock it off.

01:54:26.119 --> 01:54:27.493
God Almighty!

01:54:29.927 --> 01:54:32.512
You guys smell like you fell
into a dung heap.

01:54:32.774 --> 01:54:34.880
It kind of makes you homesick, don't it?

01:54:37.447 --> 01:54:39.389
It does kind of, doesn't it, old buddy?

01:54:39.389 --> 01:54:40.325
Yeah.

01:54:48.584 --> 01:54:49.664
Pull it.

01:55:18.858 --> 01:55:21.126
-Let's go!
-All right, move out!

01:55:32.714 --> 01:55:34.624
All right, ready to turn right.

01:55:35.370 --> 01:55:36.319
Turn!

01:55:41.418 --> 01:55:42.366
Now.

01:55:42.366 --> 01:55:43.432
Hold it!

01:55:46.699 --> 01:55:47.779
Fire!

01:55:53.035 --> 01:55:54.018
That's paint!

01:55:54.018 --> 01:55:55.019
Load up!

01:56:17.005 --> 01:56:18.411
Okay? Fire!

01:56:51.599 --> 01:56:54.982
We need explosives to get these open.
This place is built like Fort Knox!

01:56:54.982 --> 01:56:57.836
Cowboy, check around and see
ifthere's a back door.

01:57:03.887 --> 01:57:05.578
Can you see anything?

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:08.650
There's a big lump
in the middle of the floor.

01:57:08.650 --> 01:57:11.303
There's a Tiger coming down the street!

01:57:25.649 --> 01:57:27.023
Cowboy, come here!

01:57:32.336 --> 01:57:34.758
Get a hold of his arm. Take it easy, boy.

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:37.386
Easy, easy does it.

01:57:37.386 --> 01:57:40.174
Don't tell me to take it easy.
You take it easy.

01:58:36.628 --> 01:58:37.577
Hi, man.

01:58:38.517 --> 01:58:39.629
What are you doing?

01:58:39.629 --> 01:58:43.498
I'm drinking wine and eating cheese,
and catching some rays. You know?

01:58:44.436 --> 01:58:45.483
What's happening?

01:58:46.356 --> 01:58:49.040
The tank's broken
and they're trying to fix it.

01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:50.800
Then why aren't you helping them?

01:58:52.789 --> 01:58:55.506
I only ride them,
I don't know what makes them work.

01:58:59.286 --> 01:59:00.563
Oh, creeps!

01:59:02.838 --> 01:59:04.725
Definitely an anti-social type.

01:59:08.086 --> 01:59:09.842
That's my other dog imitation.

01:59:19.254 --> 01:59:21.644
-Where did he get it?
-Right here in the leg.

01:59:22.295 --> 01:59:23.243
Anything else?

01:59:23.243 --> 01:59:24.464
What do you mean?

01:59:25.014 --> 01:59:26.356
Ain't that enough for you?

01:59:27.511 --> 01:59:28.558
How do you feel?

01:59:28.951 --> 01:59:32.300
Great. Since when did you give a damn
how I felt?

01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.935
Okay, wise guy, forget it.

01:59:43.544 --> 01:59:44.493
Come here.

01:59:49.305 --> 01:59:50.385
What do you want?

01:59:51.032 --> 01:59:52.820
How things are going with the bank?

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:55.983
Nothing.

01:59:56.281 --> 01:59:59.827
The Sherman's broken down and nobody
can move that Tiger out of the square.

02:00:00.730 --> 02:00:01.939
Then make a deal.

02:00:02.329 --> 02:00:03.507
What kind of a deal?

02:00:03.507 --> 02:00:04.984
A deal deal!

02:00:05.913 --> 02:00:07.539
Maybe the guy's a Republican.

02:00:09.498 --> 02:00:11.025
Business is business.

02:00:12.602 --> 02:00:13.584
Right?

02:00:16.570 --> 02:00:17.879
Okay, big mouth.

02:00:24.698 --> 02:00:28.310
Come on, Jonesy! Get it going, Dave.
Let's go! Get it going!

02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:30.550
Come on, let's go! Get in there! Come on!

02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:32.755
Come on, let's go! Roll it in there!

02:00:33.146 --> 02:00:35.448
Bellamy, come on! We're almost finished!

02:00:35.771 --> 02:00:36.534
What?

02:00:36.534 --> 02:00:37.618
It's ready!

02:00:37.618 --> 02:00:40.147
Right! Okay, let's go!
Let's move it out here!

02:00:40.507 --> 02:00:42.033
Come on, bring them around!

02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:46.834
Where are you from, Sergeant?

02:00:47.035 --> 02:00:48.312
Jersey City.

02:00:50.236 --> 02:00:52.821
Stand up straight
when the General speaks to you.

02:00:53.116 --> 02:00:54.709
Don't you feel bad about it.

02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:57.916
You're a hell of a soldier,
I just want to shake your hand.

02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:00.918
All America's real proud of you today.

02:01:02.236 --> 02:01:03.578
All right, come on.

02:01:04.732 --> 02:01:07.035
I got a medal here in the jeep for you.

02:01:08.061 --> 02:01:09.174
A medal?

02:01:09.885 --> 02:01:12.700
$16 million...shot!

02:01:13.948 --> 02:01:15.159
It's shot, Kelly.

02:01:16.766 --> 02:01:19.187
Maybe we can use the fuel pump
from that Tiger.

02:01:19.187 --> 02:01:21.148
No, it won't work on this motor.

02:01:21.148 --> 02:01:22.555
Mechanical genius.

02:01:22.555 --> 02:01:23.799
Oh, man!

02:01:24.061 --> 02:01:28.317
Oddball, I can't make it work without
the parts no matter how positive I think!

02:01:28.894 --> 02:01:33.302
This guy in the Tiger, the least we could do
is get him on the radio and talk to him.

02:01:33.302 --> 02:01:34.453
Are you crazy?

02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:39.510
He must be a full fanatic freak! Otherwise,
he would've split 20 minutes ago.

02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:42.965
All this guy is doing,
is guarding the bank like he was told.

02:01:44.543 --> 02:01:45.655
Yeah, maybe.

02:01:47.103 --> 02:01:48.989
But I wonder if he knows what's in it.

02:04:44.872 --> 02:04:45.854
Cigarette?

02:04:45.854 --> 02:04:47.073
No smoke.

02:04:47.592 --> 02:04:51.521
The fuel system is rotten.
We have gasoline all over the place.

02:04:53.801 --> 02:04:54.848
Sorry.

02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:57.314
Hey, look, Max....

02:04:57.801 --> 02:05:00.671
You and us, we're just soldiers, right?

02:05:00.970 --> 02:05:03.142
We don't even know
what this war's all about.

02:05:03.142 --> 02:05:05.891
All we do is we fight and we die.
And for what?

02:05:05.891 --> 02:05:07.904
We don't get anything out of it.

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:12.032
In about half an hour, the American Army's
gonna be coming down that road.

02:05:12.032 --> 02:05:16.033
Why don't you do yourself a big fat favor
and get the hell out of here?

02:05:17.195 --> 02:05:18.569
I have orders.

02:05:18.569 --> 02:05:21.482
This bank isn't to fall in the hands
of the American Army.

02:05:21.899 --> 02:05:25.892
This bank's not gonna fall into the hands
of the American Army, but in our hands.

02:05:26.571 --> 02:05:28.993
You see, we're just
a private enterprise operation.

02:05:29.516 --> 02:05:31.425
You the American Army.

02:05:32.459 --> 02:05:34.019
No, baby, we ain't.

02:05:35.147 --> 02:05:37.286
You know what's inside that bank, man?

02:05:39.308 --> 02:05:42.690
There's $16 million worth of gold
in that bank, sweetheart.

02:05:53.484 --> 02:05:57.227
That's about 65 million marks.

02:05:58.221 --> 02:05:59.269
And, Sergeant...

02:06:00.173 --> 02:06:03.434
...all you have to do to have an equal share
of this money...

02:06:03.434 --> 02:06:07.143
...is crank this turret around
and blow a hole in that door.

02:08:14.708 --> 02:08:15.537
I told you!

02:08:22.773 --> 02:08:23.722
No more payments.

02:09:23.513 --> 02:09:25.204
You got it! Hit it!

02:09:26.425 --> 02:09:27.700
Come on, Little Joe!

02:09:28.568 --> 02:09:30.456
What are you gonna do with yours?

02:09:30.456 --> 02:09:33.074
Get me a new Hudson
with an electric shift.

02:09:33.074 --> 02:09:37.520
I'm gonna get me a ranch in Texas,
about 10, 20, 35 women...

02:09:39.129 --> 02:09:40.624
...and let it go.

02:09:43.834 --> 02:09:45.525
I told you it'd work, I told you!

02:09:45.525 --> 02:09:46.968
No, you never told me.

02:09:47.674 --> 02:09:48.721
You never told me.

02:09:48.721 --> 02:09:50.681
Come on, Babra, keep it moving.

02:09:50.681 --> 02:09:52.372
One Cadillac coming up, Willard!

02:09:52.372 --> 02:09:54.231
No, I'm getting a pick-up truck.

02:09:56.729 --> 02:09:58.999
Okay, Crapgame, we got our cut,
I'm moving out.

02:09:59.386 --> 02:10:01.361
Right. Take it easy, kid.

02:10:02.746 --> 02:10:03.761
See you, Big Joe!

02:10:05.211 --> 02:10:06.901
Okay. Stay lucky, you nut!

02:10:08.506 --> 02:10:09.554
See you, babe!

02:10:13.659 --> 02:10:15.001
These are getting heavy.

02:10:15.001 --> 02:10:17.816
-Buy you a lot of broads.
-I'll drink to that.

02:10:18.683 --> 02:10:20.407
Come on, let's go. Move it out!

02:10:21.276 --> 02:10:22.902
Come on, Babra, keep it moving!

02:10:22.902 --> 02:10:24.791
We have small car full.

02:10:25.116 --> 02:10:25.912
We go now.

02:10:28.124 --> 02:10:29.684
You take care of yourself now.

02:10:30.236 --> 02:10:31.251
Thank you.

02:10:42.749 --> 02:10:43.895
Auf Wiedersehen.

02:11:04.413 --> 02:11:05.875
See? What did I tell you?

02:11:06.398 --> 02:11:10.173
Now look, Oddball. The trade
for the uniforms I can understand.

02:11:10.173 --> 02:11:13.021
But to buy this tank, you got to be crazy!

02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:15.765
It's a mother beautiful tank!

02:11:16.318 --> 02:11:17.944
It's a piece of junk.

02:11:17.944 --> 02:11:20.282
The fuel system leaks all over the place!

02:11:20.282 --> 02:11:22.107
It's a piece of junk!

02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:26.900
Always with the negative waves, Moriarty.

02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:29.244
Always with the negative waves!

02:11:29.855 --> 02:11:30.783
Crap!

02:11:59.810 --> 02:12:02.265
The General's on the edge of town.
Right this minute!

02:12:02.265 --> 02:12:04.442
Okay, Gutkowski.
You go help with the gold.

02:12:08.513 --> 02:12:09.593
What do you want?

02:12:10.978 --> 02:12:15.233
After splitting with Oddball and
the Germans we should have 125 boxes.

02:12:15.650 --> 02:12:17.789
At $8,400 a box...

02:12:18.530 --> 02:12:19.807
...that's how much?

02:12:20.963 --> 02:12:22.555
That's $10,500,000.

02:12:24.642 --> 02:12:25.657
Correct!

02:12:25.986 --> 02:12:27.230
Split 12 ways?

02:12:27.618 --> 02:12:29.659
$875,000 each.

02:12:31.459 --> 02:12:33.946
Very good, Fisher. You win a cookie.

02:12:35.138 --> 02:12:36.066
Thanks.

02:12:44.387 --> 02:12:45.532
Thank you very much.

02:12:45.892 --> 02:12:49.689
I just wanted you to know
that we appreciate it very much. All of us.

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:52.921
The General's coming. Eisenhower!

02:12:53.412 --> 02:12:54.689
-De Gaulle?
-Eisenhower.

02:12:54.689 --> 02:12:55.738
That's right.

02:12:57.988 --> 02:13:00.891
You don't understand.
De Gaulle! De Gaulle!

02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:02.398
De Gaulle!

02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:06.140
The General de Gaulle is coming.
Right now! De Gaulle!

02:13:07.172 --> 02:13:09.344
De Gaulle! De Gaulle!

02:13:10.053 --> 02:13:11.710
De Gaulle! De Gaulle!

02:13:13.957 --> 02:13:15.997
Vive de Gaulle!

02:13:25.894 --> 02:13:27.618
All right, keep it moving!

02:13:30.117 --> 02:13:32.573
Come on, move it!
The cavalry's coming down the road!

02:13:32.573 --> 02:13:34.075
Give us a hand.

02:13:39.719 --> 02:13:43.515
-What are they saying, Maitland?
-They seem to think you're de Gaulle.

02:13:43.515 --> 02:13:46.406
De Gaulle? He ain't even in this war.

02:13:49.383 --> 02:13:52.066
Vive les Américains!

02:13:53.095 --> 02:13:54.306
Victory!

02:14:00.935 --> 02:14:01.731
We did it!

02:14:01.731 --> 02:14:03.742
We got it! We did it!

02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:05.477
We did it!
