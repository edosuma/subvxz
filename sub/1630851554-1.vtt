00:10.510 --> 00:15.724
Welcome to the inventive
and delicious world of Baking Impossible.

00:16.599 --> 00:21.271
If you take a dash of baking
and mix it with a sprinkle of engineering,

00:21.354 --> 00:26.276
you get delectable dessert creations
and a brand-new frosted frontier.

00:26.901 --> 00:29.070
The country's best bakers
and smartest engineers

00:29.154 --> 00:31.114
have come together to form nine teams

00:31.197 --> 00:33.616
who will compete for $100,000

00:34.534 --> 00:36.995
and the title of World's Best Bakineers.

00:37.078 --> 00:41.666
They'll bake and build incredible,
engineered mouth-watering marvels

00:41.750 --> 00:44.085
-that will be put to the ultimate test.
-[people cheering]

00:44.669 --> 00:46.004
Boundaries will be broken.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.088
[Joanne] Oh, my gosh.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.090
-[Andrew chuckles] Thought it was the tin!
-Wow.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.801
[Justin] Unimaginable cakes
will be created.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.679
The edible will become incredible.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.475
Science has never tasted so sweet.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.768
[theme music playing]

01:10.445 --> 01:11.738
Oh, my God.

01:11.821 --> 01:12.781
[Hannah chuckles]

01:13.406 --> 01:14.991
-Holy smokes!
-Wow!

01:15.075 --> 01:15.992
[laughs]

01:16.076 --> 01:17.744
-[Edwin] I love it!
-[woman laughs]

01:17.827 --> 01:18.953
Oh, my God.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.371
-[woman] So cool.
-Hi, judges.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.664
-Hello.
-Hey, Justin.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.710
I have scoured the country
to find the best bakers,

01:25.794 --> 01:27.670
the finest, most ingenious engineers,

01:27.754 --> 01:30.590
and I've paired them together
to create some bakineering magic.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.301
-[Steve sighs]
-And they've never met each other before.

01:33.384 --> 01:34.302
[chuckles]

01:34.385 --> 01:35.261
[whispers] Awkward.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.304
[chuckles]

01:37.555 --> 01:39.808
-Hey, how you doing?
-I'm good. I'm Mario.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.810
-Joey. Nice meeting you.
-Nice to meet you.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.604
-I'm from Lima, Peru.
-New York City, born and raised.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.397
-Born and raised in New York.
-Right.

01:46.481 --> 01:49.442
-So, what are those so many and pans for?
-[Joey] Sautéing.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.778
-[Mario] Uh-huh.
-[Joey] I'm very excited to transform

01:51.861 --> 01:53.530
from just a baker into a bakineer.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.116
I love learning new things
because I'm competitive

01:56.199 --> 01:59.244
in anything I put my hands in.
I don't let kids win. I'm sorry.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.038
-Check this out.
-It's so…

02:02.122 --> 02:05.959
-I am Sierra. Um, I'm a cake artist.
-Pleased to meet ya.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.794
Look at all this stuff down here.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.672
I kind of like to think of myself
as just a general artist

02:10.755 --> 02:15.385
who happened to choose cake as a medium.
We're gonna make some good stuff here.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.469
My name's Edwin.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.764
I am a self-described
underwater circuits performer.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.141
I am an engineer.

02:21.224 --> 02:24.352
I've built everything
from a functional manned submarine

02:24.435 --> 02:26.437
to a glow-in-the-dark spirograph.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.149
I've been inventing
pretty much my whole life.

02:29.232 --> 02:33.194
At three years old,
I always had itchy toes.

02:33.278 --> 02:38.116
So, I had taken, like, a toy RC car apart.
I pulled the motors and wheels out of it,

02:38.199 --> 02:40.618
put it on the end of a stick and, boom,

02:40.702 --> 02:43.204
I built myself an automatic toe scratcher.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.206
Who is this person?
Where did y'all find him?

02:45.290 --> 02:46.291
[laughs]

02:46.374 --> 02:47.709
[upbeat music playing]

02:49.043 --> 02:52.005
Well, hello. You guys ready for this?

02:52.088 --> 02:55.175
These bakineers have no idea
what's about to hit 'em.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.597
[female announcer] Mission launch
in three, two…

03:00.680 --> 03:02.891
-Whoa.
-…one. Go.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.393
-All right, let's do it.
-[Jacob] Let's go.

03:05.476 --> 03:06.519
[Edwin] We're ready.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.229
[Taylor] Sailboats?

03:08.771 --> 03:11.399
-We have to build a freakin' boat?
-Sailboat?

03:11.482 --> 03:13.193
[Mario] My God. Must have
at least one sail.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.652
Servo and rudder, that's my thing.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.362
[Brandi] Okay, so cake base,
that's for me.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.406
[Sara] Forty-five seconds
and seven knots. That's--

03:18.489 --> 03:21.284
-[Rodolfo] How fast is that?
-[Sara] It's medium on a home fan.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.619
Are you kidding?

03:22.702 --> 03:23.703
Oh, my goodness.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.290
[Justin] Andrew, you're a true mastermind,

03:27.373 --> 03:30.919
an evil genius at the intersection
of baking and engineering,

03:31.002 --> 03:32.545
the nucleus of this operation.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.715
You are a brilliant,
Cambridge-educated aerospace engineer

03:35.798 --> 03:37.842
with an incredible expertise in baking.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.678
Combining those two worlds
of baking and engineering,

03:40.762 --> 03:43.473
-I came up with "bakineering."
-[Justin] Just like that.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.517
Tell us what these teams
have to bake and build today.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.436
Each team will have nine hours

03:48.519 --> 03:51.064
to create their incredible,
edible sailboat

03:51.147 --> 03:54.901
with a built-in servo and rudder system
that they'll use to help steer it.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.862
-What is a servo and a rudder?
-That lets us control the rudder.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.449
That's what we're gonna use to move it.
Probably means it's remote-controlled.

04:01.532 --> 04:05.036
-So they're gonna need it to steer, right?
-[Sierra] Oh, wow! That's amazing.

04:05.119 --> 04:08.122
[Andrew] Their boats have to be
at least two feet in length

04:08.206 --> 04:11.167
and their boats will have to face
the stress test

04:11.251 --> 04:13.419
that we've designed
specifically for this mission.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.465
They'll have to sail their creations
across nearly 20 feet of water

04:17.548 --> 04:19.259
in under 45 seconds.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.511
-Whew!
-[Andrew] The vessels have to stay afloat

04:21.594 --> 04:22.804
if they wanna go the distance.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.932
This is a tough mission.
Food isn't meant to float.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.393
So, we're demanding incredible ingenuity

04:28.476 --> 04:31.437
to make the impossible
just about possible.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.234
From an engineering standpoint,
basically, whatever we build,

04:36.317 --> 04:38.695
we just have to consider
that we need buoyant force

04:38.778 --> 04:40.071
to be greater than gravity.

04:40.154 --> 04:44.367
And the force of the wind has to be
greater than the friction force

04:44.450 --> 04:46.369
of the water against the boat.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.538
And it needs to be waterproof.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.916
-Yeah, that's a critical detail. [laughs]
-So the water doesn't get into the cake.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.961
I would say you could build
the entire boat out of chocolate.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.671
Okay, why do you say that?

04:56.754 --> 04:59.424
It repels water. It's oil-based.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.093
And as long as the water is cold water,
it won't melt.

05:02.176 --> 05:05.388
So, the only thing
that I can think of that would float…

05:05.471 --> 05:09.726
-Yeah?
-…is Rice Krispie treats with chocolate.

05:09.809 --> 05:13.229
If these boats are gonna survive,
the first thing is recognizing

05:13.313 --> 05:16.274
-that cake is usually not waterproof.
-[chuckles]

05:16.357 --> 05:17.608
A boat must be waterproof.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.738
We've got Dr. O, you're a
Stanford-educated, PhD rocket scientist,

05:21.821 --> 05:25.908
astrophysicist and inventor
with seven patents. Do you sleep?

05:25.992 --> 05:28.036
-Power naps, man. [chuckles]
-[Justin] Okay.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.496
I'm gonna judge it based on engineering.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.790
If it's not well-engineered,
it won't survive.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.709
There's something called dead dough.

05:34.792 --> 05:38.046
In the cake world,
it doesn't have any yeast in it.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.465
It has two types of flour,
but it's so strong.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.092
We've got Chef Joanne Chang,
one of the most accomplished

05:43.176 --> 05:45.386
and celebrated pastry chefs
in the country.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.888
You've won a James Beard Award.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.141
You run nine successful bakeries.
You've written five cookbooks.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.226
You also happen to be Harvard-educated.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.271
I decide
if they pass or fail in the baking.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.523
I'm gonna be judging them on the taste.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.651
I'm so excited to see what they do
with all of those ingredients

06:00.735 --> 06:03.988
that are back in the pastry kitchen.
On top of having to make

06:04.072 --> 06:07.825
a functional boat that's edible,
they also have to incorporate a dessert

06:07.909 --> 06:10.286
into the boat's design
so we have something to taste.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.622
I think what we should focus on is

06:12.705 --> 06:14.957
-what theme we want for our boat to be.
-Okay.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.459
What about…

06:16.542 --> 06:19.379
This is one of my favorite cakes
that I've ever done.

06:19.462 --> 06:23.007
…a Willy Wonka-inspired candy boat?

06:23.091 --> 06:24.926
-Like the candy man?
-Like the candy man.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.720
Instead of the drunk boat theme,
'cause it's so old-school,

06:27.804 --> 06:29.013
why don't we update it?

06:29.097 --> 06:31.849
-Like a party boat? Yes.
-A party boat, since I'm from Miami?

06:31.933 --> 06:36.020
-What about Medieval Renaissance?
-We could totally do it.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.188
How many sails though?

06:37.271 --> 06:39.690
If it has seven knots of wind,
we could do two.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.485
I'll run to the pantry
and grab some of the things I need.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.280
[Hannah] All right. Let's go, let's go.
Pantry, pantry.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.366
-[Mario hums]
-[Randi muttering]

06:49.409 --> 06:51.828
-How many trays of eggs do you need?
-[Steve] Two.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.831
-You definitely can't get these.
-See, this is why we have you.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.624
-This is why we're together.
-Yeah.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.213
[Randi] Measure out
30 ounces of marshmallows.

07:02.296 --> 07:05.007
[Jacob] All right.
Said one tablespoon of butter?

07:05.091 --> 07:07.218
Take one tablespoon.
Don't want too much fat.

07:07.301 --> 07:10.263
For Rice Krispie treats,
it's not always precise.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.765
[Jacob] This is a horrible job.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.058
[Randi chuckles]

07:16.519 --> 07:19.230
So do you think
that this is going to weigh the boat down?

07:19.313 --> 07:23.067
I do, but given the volume of the boat, 
I think this isn't gonna be an issue.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.696
It's how to think of it. If our boat
isn't heavier than water it's displacing…

07:26.779 --> 07:28.322
-[Cindy] I like it.
-[Taylor] We're good.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.451
Perfect. Beautiful.
You're officially a baker now.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.827
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.036
That's all it took.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.205
Taylor and I are making
a butterfly sailboat

07:36.289 --> 07:39.375
made out of dead dough,
coating chocolate and rice paper.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.002
It's very strong.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.505
It doesn't have any yeast
or anything in it, so it's very stable.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.799
What's that smell like? [sniffs]

07:46.883 --> 07:49.051
-Oh. Like dough.
-[chuckles]

07:49.135 --> 07:51.262
I didn't wanna use Rice Krispie treats.

07:51.345 --> 07:55.308
Rice Krispie treats are really finicky
with water and just moisture in general.

07:55.391 --> 07:59.353
[Taylor] This mold is inspired
by if you were doing a carbon fiber layup,

07:59.437 --> 08:03.107
where the foam mold is foil
and the carbon fiber is dead dough.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.525
As an engineering system,

08:04.609 --> 08:08.905
this has to float across the distance
and has to be a certain size.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.032
-I have to get on the table.
-This is awesome.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.783
So, it needs to be strong,

08:12.867 --> 08:15.703
it needs to be heavy,
and it needs to be pliable and workable

08:15.786 --> 08:19.290
so we can get it into the shape we need,
and dead dough checked all the boxes.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.917
Oh, that was smooth.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.961
[Cindy] Dead dough is
so structurally sound.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.254
Careful, don't burn yourself.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.381
You could hurt somebody really bad

08:27.465 --> 08:29.675
-with a really hard piece of dead dough.
-[chuckles]

08:30.510 --> 08:31.886
-Cindy, Taylor.
-Hello.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.179
-What's up?
-What's up?

08:33.262 --> 08:37.058
-[chuckling] Nice to meet you guys.
-We've got some good energy flowing.

08:37.141 --> 08:39.310
Her cake artistry
and my engineering skills

08:39.393 --> 08:41.395
are multiplicative, not summative.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.523
-It's great.
-Tell us a bit about yourselves.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.108
-I'm a little weirdo.
-[all laugh]

08:46.192 --> 08:49.153
I just like quirky designs.
Look, I'm making a butterfly boat.

08:49.237 --> 08:52.114
Fantastic. What type of cake
are you going to make for us?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.367
I am baking a vanilla chiffon cake,

08:54.450 --> 08:57.578
and it's going to have
lavender-infused cream.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.122
And then some fresh blueberries,
cut the sweetness.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.167
We're kind of playing
on the theme of flowers and whimsical.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.627
Since butterflies,
I'm pretty sure,

09:04.710 --> 09:06.045
-like lavender.
-[Andrew chuckles]

09:06.128 --> 09:07.171
That sounds wonderful.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.215
[Cindy] I've been
doing this for over ten years.

09:09.298 --> 09:12.134
My favorite aspect of it
is connecting with my customers

09:12.218 --> 09:14.637
and also the decorating part of it.

09:15.513 --> 09:19.392
I remember, as a little girl,
watching baking competitions.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.645
I was like, "Okay, this is it.
This is for me. I'm good."

09:22.728 --> 09:26.732
But coming from an Asian culture,
you're taught to either be an engineer,

09:26.816 --> 09:29.860
a doctor, um, a lawyer,
something that makes money.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.071
This competition is really important to me

09:32.154 --> 09:34.907
because I do want to inspire
other little girls

09:34.991 --> 09:38.035
and I just want them to know
that they can-- I'm getting emotional!

09:38.119 --> 09:39.912
-Oh!
-I just want them to know

09:39.996 --> 09:41.914
that they can shoot for the stars.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.499
Oh, my God, why am I crying?

09:43.583 --> 09:44.584
Can we restart that?

09:48.879 --> 09:51.090
Taylor?
What's your background as an engineer?

09:51.173 --> 09:53.634
I normally work
on electro-mechanical systems,

09:53.718 --> 09:56.971
but usually I do stuff that I describe
as a creative technologist.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.473
Like how do people feel about
the computer they use

09:59.557 --> 10:02.852
and the shape of the mouse,
or the size of the window.

10:02.935 --> 10:06.856
I'm a mechanical engineer.
I'm originally from Los Angeles.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.150
I knew I had an engineer's mind
when I was little

10:09.233 --> 10:13.195
and I'd do mixing projects in the kitchen
where I'd just take random things

10:13.279 --> 10:15.406
and see what happens
when you put them together.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.284
The thing I like most
that I've built recently is Cheeseborg.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.244
It's a grilled cheese-making robot.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.623
You ask it to make you a grilled cheese
and it assembly-line-style

10:23.706 --> 10:26.459
pops out a grilled cheese,
hot and fresh for you to eat.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.629
Can you tell us about how you're creating
and engineering the boat?

10:29.712 --> 10:33.257
-Yeah. This is dead dough.
-And is it heavy? Is it light?

10:33.341 --> 10:36.427
It is pretty heavy,
but calculations have told us

10:36.510 --> 10:38.804
we have a lot of weight
we can play with with this.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.806
Do you think it's gonna hold?

10:40.890 --> 10:44.143
Um, yeah, I'm not hesitating.
I'm pretty confident with this.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.604
-There was a little hesitation there.
-There was. [chuckles]

10:51.651 --> 10:53.653
So, this is gonna be our hull form.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.906
There's two of these for each hull.
I'll cut these on the laser cutters

10:56.989 --> 10:58.574
and then bake them in that shape,

10:58.658 --> 11:01.285
help us get the Rice Krispies treats
in the right shape.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.121
-What is it made of?
-It's wood, so we can't get it too hot.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.625
Oh, shoot, I didn't know you could
bake wood. That makes sense.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.711
-You can as long as-- Yeah.
-[chuckles] Nothing's gonna catch on fire.

11:10.795 --> 11:14.382
We're going with a catamaran design,
which uses two separate hulls.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.133
We'll have to build two boats.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.969
Twice as much work,
but we think it's gonna be more stable.

The question is,
how do we make this thing stable enough

15:57.957 --> 15:59.917
with the bridge deck
so it'll hold together?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.587
So I'm worried that we put this on here
and then we have another piece on here.

16:03.671 --> 16:07.132
-[Sierra] Yeah. It's just gonna fold up.
-The way they float, it's just not gonna--

16:07.216 --> 16:09.802
That doesn't give me confidence
that it'll hold together.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.553
Our original idea was catamaran.

16:11.637 --> 16:15.265
But I think we can do it with one hull.
If we're making one boat, we have a boat.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.851
-Do we really?
-Yeah. We put a mast in this thing.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.270
We don't have time
to redesign a lot of stuff.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.107
You don't wanna make it a catamaran
'cause these are too big?

16:23.190 --> 16:24.483
-[Edwin] Yes.
-[Sierra] All right.

16:24.566 --> 16:28.737
So then, my next thought is
how to make it look attractive

16:28.821 --> 16:30.698
and where to put the cake.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.784
Forget the catamaran.
We've gotta go with something new.

16:33.867 --> 16:37.371
It's time to pivot.
So, we got to build a monohull.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.747
We're gonna pivot fast.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.168

We only have hours left,

16:43.252 --> 16:46.046
so for Sierra and Edwin
to be doing a redesign at this point

16:46.130 --> 16:47.840
is really concerning.

for some candies,

19:52.566 --> 19:54.693
Look,
you're already beating each other up.

19:54.776 --> 19:57.196
-Bakineer spouses.
-He's my work husband right now.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.989
-Absolutely.
-Wok husband, work wife.

19:59.072 --> 20:01.158
-That's right, you're my first husband.
-Ah! Sure.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.117
[both laughing]

20:02.201 --> 20:04.411
-I have a wife.
-[all laughing]

20:04.494 --> 20:07.080
[Sara] Chantelle is my lovely,
amazing, beautiful wife.

20:07.164 --> 20:10.667
We will have been married ten years
this coming New Year's Eve.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.086
I don't think
I'm the easiest person to be with,

20:13.170 --> 20:17.132
but she manages
to keep up and forgives.

20:17.216 --> 20:21.053
Doesn't maybe always forget, but forgives.
She is the light of my life.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.597
-Can't wait to see what you do.
-Thank you.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.766
-I'll get out of your way.
-[Rodolfo] Thank you, man.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.976
[beatboxing]

20:28.060 --> 20:29.811
Manuka, can you beatbox?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.313
No, but I can dance.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.274
-Try it. Try beatbox.
-No, I don't know how to beatbox.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.652
You should beatbox,
you can work while you do that.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.945
[saw whirring]

20:38.028 --> 20:39.196
Look!

20:40.948 --> 20:42.449
-That's gorgeous.
-[chuckles]

20:43.075 --> 20:44.034
[Cindy] Okay, I like it.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.995
Ooh, cool.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.747
-[timer ticking]
-[Justin] Teams!

20:49.414 --> 20:51.416
-Three hours left!
-[groans]

20:53.919 --> 20:54.878
[Mario mutters]

20:54.962 --> 20:57.547
-[Joey] We're taking on a lot of water.
-[Mario] Let go.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.091
[Joey] It's gonna capsize.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.134
We're too heavy in the front
with the head.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.303
-Gotta add weight to the back.
-[Mario] There's a hole.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.638
[Joey] That's bringing it up?

21:04.721 --> 21:07.599
-'Cause I feel unbalanced.
-It's balanced. She's not unbalanced.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.894
She just has a hole here.
Let me check really quick. Okay.

21:10.978 --> 21:11.937
-Well…
-Alrighty.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.313
There. That's why we test.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.733
It just started to absorb little by--
Like a sponge on the inside.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.444
Now, it's cased in chocolate.
The chocolate looked great,

21:19.528 --> 21:21.321
but on the inside is where damage is.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.866
Almost like, I guess,
termites eating away from the inside out.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.244
[Mario] We have
a major structural problem.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.288
[Joey] This is where it got wet,
from the skewers.

21:29.371 --> 21:33.166
Yeah. It's collapsing on us here too,
Joey. All of this is bad.

21:34.084 --> 21:39.339
We need to restructure the bottom.
Cover it with, uh, more rice cereal.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.220
Okay. All right. It seems like--

21:46.013 --> 21:49.725
But, uh, we need to find
something else for buoyancy.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.894
-'Cause you're gonna wanna put more.
-I wanna put more.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.605
We're noticing that the boat is heavy

21:55.689 --> 21:58.066
without any
of your beautiful decorations on it,

21:58.150 --> 21:59.735
so we'll need some buoyant force.

21:59.818 --> 22:03.697
Do you think they have things
not for baking but, like, cooking?

22:03.780 --> 22:05.157
-Sausage?
-Sausage case?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.451
Yeah, we could blow them up like bladders.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.661
We found some sausage casings

22:09.745 --> 22:12.039
-which you can blow up…
-[Rodolfo chuckles]

22:12.122 --> 22:14.249
…and they have some natural buoyancy.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.375
I'm gonna go for it.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.878
Oh, my God. They're like a giant,
tangled, freakin' knot.

22:17.961 --> 22:19.629
[groans]

22:19.713 --> 22:21.882
So I can get some lift,

22:21.965 --> 22:24.551
and really hoping
that the sausage casings on this side

22:24.634 --> 22:26.887
are the same buoyancy as on this side.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.472
Oh, look at this.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.933
[chuckles] That look gross.
I don't know what this is.

22:32.017 --> 22:32.976
It is gross.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.436
You want me to make you one?

22:34.519 --> 22:36.271
I'm gonna make you a balloon animal.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.981
Ooh!

22:38.565 --> 22:41.360
-[upbeat music playing]
-[timer ticking]

22:41.443 --> 22:44.363
[Justin] Bakineers, time is ticking.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.656
-Two hours left.
-Whoa! That was quick.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.412
Renee, come here.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.456
-Cool spray from the front.
-Here?

22:56.958 --> 23:00.587
Where do you think is the best weight-wise
to put this cake?

23:00.670 --> 23:03.382
Middle is good. If you put it
on the sides, put it on both.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.758
Okay.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.553
-[Edwin] How heavy is that cake?
-[Sierra] Uh…

23:08.637 --> 23:11.264
Maybe four pounds.
Three pounds. Two pounds. I don't know.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.601
All right. Weight on top cancels
weight on bottom. We gotta go with it.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.144
-I think--
-Okay.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.438
There's a decent chance it might tip over,

23:18.522 --> 23:20.524
but we're gonna make it beautiful.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.526
[upbeat music playing]

23:27.864 --> 23:29.616
[Taylor] They may not catch wind,
you know?

23:31.118 --> 23:31.993
[timer ticking]

23:32.077 --> 23:34.496
Teams, only 30 minutes left.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.748
-Wow.
-[Brandi] All right, turn the boat.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.750
-[Renee] Okay.
-[air hissing]

23:38.834 --> 23:40.961
[Sierra] Okay, so now
I'm gonna put the cake back on.

23:41.044 --> 23:43.547
All right, judges, wanna head
to the activation room?

23:43.630 --> 23:45.090
-They seem ready.
-Let's do it.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.591
[dramatic music playing]

23:47.426 --> 23:52.305
Bakineers, our illustrious brain trust
is heading to get things prepared

23:52.389 --> 23:56.101
for the stress test.
Trust me, a storm is a-coming.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.687
Rudder's working. That's perfect.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.064
And how sure are you
that this is gonna float?

24:01.148 --> 24:03.066
After looking at the amount of weight

24:03.150 --> 24:04.943
-that we have on top…
-[Sierra] Uh-huh.

24:05.026 --> 24:06.361
…I give us fifty-fifty.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.821
[dramatic music playing]

24:09.531 --> 24:10.824
[Shanice sighs]

24:12.909 --> 24:17.247
[Sara] Come on, work with me, intestines.
It actually looks like a sea monster.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.958
Now, when this goes up,
will it hold enough weight?

24:21.585 --> 24:23.628
-Wanna heat up some chocolate quickly?
-[Renee] Yeah.

24:24.379 --> 24:25.213
Three minutes.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.298
[Justin exclaims]

24:26.381 --> 24:27.507
-No!
-Three minutes?

24:27.591 --> 24:30.552
-We gotta finish.
-Batten down the hatches.

24:30.635 --> 24:31.845
Here goes.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.889
We have our sail.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.057
[Renee mumbles]

24:36.141 --> 24:37.184
I-- Right.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.019
[Renee gasps]

24:40.687 --> 24:42.939
[Steve] It broke. Lost the pagoda.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.399
Where's our temper chocolate?

24:44.483 --> 24:45.692
Grab the temper chocolate.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.570
Now it's crunch time.
Let's get this thing done.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.113
[dramatic music playing]

24:54.075 --> 24:55.785
-[Mario] Last touches.
-No, the other way.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.621
Last touches. There you go.

25:11.718 --> 25:15.055
The clock is ticking
and the isomalt is melting.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.060
Go grab the batteries.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.146
-[timer ticking]
-Ten. Nine.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.357
-Hurry up.
-[Justin] Eight. Seven.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.401
-Six. Five. Four.
-[Sierra groans]

25:28.485 --> 25:31.821
Three. Two. One.

25:31.905 --> 25:32.989
Gears up.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.700
-Ganache down. Your time is up!
-[all applaud]

25:35.784 --> 25:36.910
[Renee whoops]

25:37.953 --> 25:40.539
-[Sierra] Oh, my gosh.
-I wanna just cry.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.125
I think it looks absolutely gorgeous.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.086
[Justin] Okay, teams.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.462
Follow me.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.797
[dramatic music playing]

25:53.510 --> 25:56.805
Bakineers, are you ready to see
the rough waters you'll have to weather?

25:56.888 --> 25:58.974
-[Joey] Yeah!
-[Justin] Behold.

26:00.892 --> 26:03.103
[all gasping, cheering]

26:03.186 --> 26:05.730
[Edwin chuckling] Look at that!

26:05.814 --> 26:07.899
-[Sierra] Whoa!
-[Taylor] Wow.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.445
[Brandi] Oh, my gosh.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.822
[Jacob] That is so cool.

26:13.905 --> 26:14.990
[Renee chuckles]

26:16.741 --> 26:18.994
[Justin] Ship is about to get real, guys.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.670
Bakineers, welcome to your very first

26:28.753 --> 26:30.714
Baking Impossible stress test,

26:31.464 --> 26:34.092
or as I like to call it, the Sea of Doom.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.220
I thought we were calling it
The Motion of the Ocean?

26:37.304 --> 26:38.638
[all laugh]

26:39.222 --> 26:42.475
Propelled only by the wind
and your hopes and fears,

26:43.268 --> 26:48.064
each of your boats must navigate
all 20 feet and 6,000 pounds of this tank,

26:48.148 --> 26:51.443
from the start to the finish line,
in under 45 seconds.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.154
[Justin] You need to beware
of uneven shoreline,

26:54.237 --> 26:57.032
the islands, the shipwrecks,

26:57.532 --> 26:59.367
-Michael Phelps.
-[all laughing]

27:01.119 --> 27:04.164
So, good luck.
Cindy, Taylor, you guys are up.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.457
[cheery music playing]

27:08.418 --> 27:10.962
We wanted our personality
to shine in what we built.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.840
So, we landed on this sort of enchanted,

27:13.923 --> 27:16.843
whimsical fairy-tale, butterfly dreamboat.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.387
It is literally a hundred percent edible,

27:19.471 --> 27:22.766
except for the electrical components
and the steering mechanism.

27:22.849 --> 27:26.519
We used some novel materials,
like dead dough and rice paper,

27:26.603 --> 27:29.648
then more traditional materials,
like fondant and modeling chocolate

27:29.731 --> 27:31.066
and isomalt also.

27:32.525 --> 27:35.070
It is time to see
if your butterfly dreamboat

27:35.153 --> 27:37.697
will bring good or bad dreams.
Put her in the water.

27:37.781 --> 27:41.368
[Cindy] Taylor is steering the boat.
I can't even steer in a Mario Kart game.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.036
-[all chuckle]
-[Justin] All right.

27:43.119 --> 27:46.956
-My heart is beating so fast.
-Launch the fans in three, two, one.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.917
There she blows.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.210
[dramatic music playing]

27:59.636 --> 28:00.637
Ooh!

28:01.971 --> 28:03.682
Goes. Yeah!

28:03.765 --> 28:04.808
[contestants applauding]

28:10.814 --> 28:12.857
-Whoop!
-Oh! Oh!

28:12.941 --> 28:14.234
[all gasp]

28:19.572 --> 28:21.116
We're steerin'.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.243
Oop!

28:23.952 --> 28:25.453
We're still steering.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.959
[Cindy] Come on.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.629
-You made it!
-[all cheering]

28:38.341 --> 28:39.592
[Hakeem] Oh, man.

28:41.511 --> 28:45.432
So, as I look at your boat,
clearly it performed hydrodynamically.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.517
Who actually designed the shape?

28:48.059 --> 28:49.602
-The engineer?
-[Taylor] Yes.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.895
This was actually cast

28:50.979 --> 28:52.564
-out of a positive mold.
-Mm.

28:52.647 --> 28:57.652
[Taylor] We did our best to get it uniform
and horizontally and vertically symmetric.

28:57.736 --> 29:01.197
I think the way that the rudder performed
showed that it was sufficient.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.783
Where you placed the rudder
was absolutely perfect.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.660
Your boat performed very well.

29:05.744 --> 29:06.786
Let's taste it.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.334
-Thank you. [chuckles]
-[Joanne chuckles]

29:13.418 --> 29:14.669
Thank you so much.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.920
-Thank you.
-Of course.

29:17.505 --> 29:19.632
[Cindy] For our tasting,
we have a vanilla chiffon cake,

29:19.716 --> 29:24.012
light and airy, just like butterflies,
with a lavender-infused cream

29:24.095 --> 29:26.264
and fresh blueberries
to give you some texture.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.683
Did you soak the chiffon with anything?

29:28.767 --> 29:31.186
-Um, a little bit of honey syrup.
-Great.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.231
-Justin finished his.
-[all laughing]

29:37.192 --> 29:38.276
[Joanne] Cindy and Taylor.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.197
I really love
how this cake matches the boat.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.823
When we were talking about

29:43.907 --> 29:47.535
what kind of cake goes
with a butterfly, dreamy, ethereal boat,

29:47.619 --> 29:51.331
we were thinking something light and airy,
and you've done that with this cake.

29:51.414 --> 29:54.751
I think the texture
of the sponge is really delicious

29:54.834 --> 29:57.504
and the blueberry has
a nice little crunch to it

29:57.587 --> 29:59.005
and adds a little bit of acid.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.590
Thank you so much. Thank you.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.258
[Andrew] Cindy and Taylor,

30:02.342 --> 30:04.677
what I'm impressed with
is your use of dead dough.

30:04.761 --> 30:07.222
It was really very stable in the water.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.015
To be honest, I was a bit concerned

30:09.098 --> 30:11.226
that those butterfly sails
might have crumpled.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.729
They might have flown away.
[chuckles] But they stayed stable.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.232
It went along the entire course.
So, very well done.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.358
Thank you.

30:18.441 --> 30:21.069
-Up next, Sara and Rodolfo.
-[all applaud, cheer]

30:21.152 --> 30:22.362
[dramatic music playing]

30:25.824 --> 30:30.912
Judges, today, bakineers turn buccaneers.
We went with a pirate theme.

30:32.288 --> 30:35.291
On this journey,
we are being attacked by a sea creature,

30:35.375 --> 30:37.627
and, hopefully,
it won't drag them to the ground.

30:37.710 --> 30:38.753
[chuckles]

30:38.837 --> 30:42.423
For the sails, we used wax paper
with Flexique.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.718
For the mast,
we have pastas covered in chocolate.

30:46.594 --> 30:48.847
Fondant on the sides
and details in fondant.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.223
[Sara] The base of the boat

30:50.306 --> 30:52.934
is made out of Rice Krispies
with rice rolls as structure

30:53.017 --> 30:56.646
and cross braces out of pretzels,
coated in melting chocolate.

30:56.729 --> 30:59.065
It has a Rice Krispie keel as well.

30:59.148 --> 31:01.734
And there are some sausage casings

31:01.818 --> 31:04.028
that were used as a buoyancy device

31:04.112 --> 31:07.115
and also are going to help
balance out on the sides.

31:07.198 --> 31:10.159
Well, Sara, Rodolfo,
let's release the Kraken.

31:12.453 --> 31:14.873
All right.
Sara, Rodolfo, you have 45 seconds.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.374
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.877
[Justin] Three, two, one.

31:21.004 --> 31:21.880
[Joanne] Oh, boy.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.799
-Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
-[Andrew] Ooh!

31:24.883 --> 31:26.676
[Joanne chuckles]

31:26.759 --> 31:28.177
[contestants gasp]

31:28.803 --> 31:30.013
-[Sara groans]
-[Rodolfo gasps]

31:30.096 --> 31:31.306
-[Brandi] Oh, God!
-Oh!

31:31.389 --> 31:33.349
Oh, no.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.437
-[woman] Good job, guys.
-[all applaud]

31:39.814 --> 31:42.066
I'd like to say,
even though it didn't function,

31:42.150 --> 31:44.152
there was some great engineering.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.321
I loved the shape of your hull.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.365
I loved your sails
and I thought it was really clever

31:49.449 --> 31:52.452
how you added the monster
to add extra buoyancy.

31:52.535 --> 31:56.915
Now, you were aware
that you were top-heavy on your boat.

31:56.998 --> 32:00.335
When you have things
that can lead to catastrophe,

32:00.418 --> 32:02.295
you want to build in a safety margin.

32:02.378 --> 32:05.173
A wider margin
could've been very helpful for you.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.258
But we can still try your cake.

32:07.342 --> 32:10.053
Luckily, we had you save
an extra piece of cake for us,

32:10.136 --> 32:11.179
in case your boat sank.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.263
Thank goodness.

32:13.556 --> 32:15.016
[Rodolfo] For the tasting portion,

32:15.099 --> 32:18.645
we're using a chocolate cake,
a little rum, chocolate mousse,

32:18.728 --> 32:20.980
and a dark ganache with pistachios.

32:21.064 --> 32:25.193
Rodolfo, this is for the chocolate
and the rum lovers out there.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.820
I do love
that you've tied it in with the theme.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.406
You can tell
these are little cannons sat on the deck.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.408
They didn't pop out. They blended in.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.993
-Really well done.
-Thank you.

32:34.077 --> 32:37.205
I was really, really impressed
with all of the level of detail

32:37.288 --> 32:41.125
of the design work. The cake is
everything I want a sponge cake to be.

32:41.209 --> 32:44.629
The chocolate ganache shell
is a little overpowering.

32:46.255 --> 32:51.094
If it had more of the pistachio flavor,
then maybe it would add a nice balance.

32:52.679 --> 32:56.182
But it actually, for me,
it overpowers the overall dessert

32:56.265 --> 32:58.267
because it's so strongly ganache.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.937
-Thank you.
-Steve and Renee.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.901
We came up with the idea
to build an exciting sushi boat

33:06.985 --> 33:09.654
with a very exciting sushi dessert.

33:09.737 --> 33:13.157
This boat is 99.9% chocolate.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.118
Andrew, if you wanna push the edible,

33:15.201 --> 33:17.704
this is about as far as you can go,
minus the lights.

33:17.787 --> 33:20.039
-Okay.
-Now it's time for the fun part.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.041
Let's see what floats this boat.

33:23.584 --> 33:25.420
Bakineers, you have 45 seconds.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.922
Three. Two. One.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.173
Go.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.925
[dramatic music playing]

33:31.009 --> 33:32.468
[Joanne whispers] Go.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.804
-Go.
-[Steve] Yes!

33:34.887 --> 33:35.930
[Renee laughs]

33:36.014 --> 33:37.223
-Stay on the rudder.
-Okay.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.642
[contestants laugh, cheer]

33:39.726 --> 33:41.519
-[Renee] Oh, octopus.
-[Steve] Hit the rudder.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.688
Oh, hit the rudder.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I was--

33:43.771 --> 33:45.231
-[Joanne] Uh-oh. Oh, no!
-No!

33:46.274 --> 33:47.191
[Renee groans]

33:48.067 --> 33:49.610
Oh, no!

33:55.241 --> 33:57.618
I'm sorry, that was my bad.
I wasn't focusing.

33:57.702 --> 33:58.870
[Joanne] Uh-oh!

33:58.953 --> 34:00.371
[squeals]

34:00.455 --> 34:01.497
All right. We're done.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.500
Steve and Renee, time is up.

34:04.584 --> 34:08.463
I'm curious, how did you guys decide
who was gonna, uh, steer the ship?

34:09.464 --> 34:11.966
-My engineer.
-[laughs]

34:12.050 --> 34:13.676
I gave that up to her. I said,

34:13.760 --> 34:18.264
"You got this, Renee. I'll make it float,
you make it go down the stretch."

34:18.347 --> 34:19.724
She goes, "I got it."

34:19.807 --> 34:21.142
[Andrew chuckles]

34:23.102 --> 34:26.189
-But it didn't sink.
-[contestants] Yeah!

34:27.315 --> 34:29.108
It's time to taste that sushi.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.654
Thank you very much. [chuckles]

34:35.281 --> 34:37.408
[Joanne] Tell us about
what you've made us here.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.160
[Steve] Basically, it's a genoise.

34:39.243 --> 34:43.289
It has a white chocolate mousseline
infused with a passion fruit puree.

34:43.372 --> 34:44.499
Yuzu simple syrup,

34:44.582 --> 34:47.418
passion fruit caviar
garnished with strawberries.

34:47.502 --> 34:52.006
Steve and Renee, I think the cake is
really beautiful and very well-balanced.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.509
Really nice job
tying in the tropical with the boat.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.262
I think, for me, I would like
a little bit more textural contrast.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.598
Um, it starts to feel a little bit mushy.

35:00.681 --> 35:04.018
I feel like there could be
another element in there, texture-wise,

35:04.102 --> 35:05.686
that'd bring this to the next level.

35:06.187 --> 35:09.690
Steve and Renee,
I noticed you used a double hull design.

35:09.774 --> 35:12.527
When I look at your hull,
the placement of your rudder,

35:12.610 --> 35:15.238
the shape of your sail, it suggests to me

35:15.321 --> 35:19.033
that perhaps someone on your team
understands something about sailing.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.618
Correct. We both do, actually.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.537
There's a lot of physics with sailing,

35:22.620 --> 35:25.289
so I see
that you understood the physics well.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.167
When you put it in the water,
it floated perfectly,

35:28.251 --> 35:29.710
but it was operator error.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.629
Yeah. I was very excited.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.925
Steve and Renee,
your sail, lovely and large.

35:36.008 --> 35:41.472
Using chocolate is a sensible choice
in this case. Chocolate is waterproof,

35:41.556 --> 35:44.725
so deciding to make your entire boat
out of that was a good call.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.353
It looked like it could've
happily floated for hours.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.398
Thank you, Steve and Renee.
Joey and Mario.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.400
[dramatic music playing]

35:53.192 --> 35:56.487
In front of you, you have
one of the most terrifying sea creatures.

35:56.571 --> 35:59.574
We decided to not make a very tall ship

35:59.657 --> 36:02.618
because we didn't want to compromise
the center of mass.

36:03.119 --> 36:05.663
Let's put this sea beast in the sea.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.335
Fans are firing up in three, two, one.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.006
[Joey] There she goes. Ah, it's over.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.009
[Mario] No.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.596
-[contestants groan]
-[chuckles]

36:22.346 --> 36:25.933
-It also doubles as a submarine.
-It could be the Loch Ness Monster.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.519
-[Vanessa] No.
-[Hakeem] Oh, my God.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.482
Mario, I think
that what happened with your boat

36:33.566 --> 36:34.942
was the weight distribution.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.529
They conspired
to just make that guy just turn instantly.

36:38.613 --> 36:42.283
Ideally, you would weight
the bottom of the boat

36:42.366 --> 36:44.368
and not have
a uniform distribution of weight

36:44.452 --> 36:46.412
'cause that moves
the center of mass higher.

36:46.495 --> 36:48.372
We can control everything but nature.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.458
That wasn't nature.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.459
[both laugh]

36:53.502 --> 36:56.005
[Joey] The dessert is an almond apple cake

36:56.088 --> 36:58.925
nested in a shortbread
cookie dough tart shell,

36:59.008 --> 37:02.386
with a rum glaze,
garnished with apple and sliced almonds.

37:02.470 --> 37:06.224
I do love
all of the different textural elements

37:06.307 --> 37:07.767
of this cake/tart.

37:07.850 --> 37:10.144
-Thank you.
-[Joanne] I love the almond flavor.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.939
I think there's a bit
of a heavy hand with the cinnamon,

37:13.940 --> 37:16.108
and, from a presentation point of view,

37:16.192 --> 37:18.694
it'd be nice to have something
a little more refined.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.947
Joey, Mario,
from a bakineering point of view,

37:21.030 --> 37:23.074
I love your design.
It was kind of majestic.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.159
A lot of great edible portions on there.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.370
I think when it came to your boat,

37:27.453 --> 37:30.498
your hull shape was
probably a little bit on the round side.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.750
So if you imagine people running on a log,

37:32.833 --> 37:34.043
it has a tendency to spin.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.212
It's very sensitive stability-wise.

37:36.295 --> 37:38.839
So, I think you gave yourselves
a tough challenge.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.883
Joey, Mario, thank you very much.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.593
-Brandi, Menuka, you're up.
-[cheering]

37:42.677 --> 37:43.886
[dramatic music playing]

37:44.929 --> 37:46.013
It's a Viking ship.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.849
We decided to construct
out of Rice Krispie

37:48.933 --> 37:50.351
and cover with chocolate

37:50.434 --> 37:52.812
and also try to use
as much cinnamon as I can.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.397
Let's put this ship in the water.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.858
-[all gasp]
-[Brandi] No!

37:57.942 --> 37:59.485
[Andrew] Oh!

38:00.611 --> 38:01.946
[Justin] Nina and Hannah.

38:02.029 --> 38:05.491
This is a Renaissance boat.
Very fabulous, very lovely.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.161
-[all gasp]
-[groans]

38:11.372 --> 38:12.748
[Justin] Randi, Jacob.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.209
And we're off.

38:17.169 --> 38:18.004
[Jacob] No.

38:18.504 --> 38:19.380
[chuckles]

38:19.463 --> 38:21.507
-Come on, come on!
-[Justin] Three.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.968
-Two, one.
-[contestants] Two, one.

38:24.051 --> 38:24.927
[Justin] Time.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.430
[Shanice] Almost! So close!

38:27.513 --> 38:28.723
It was close.

38:28.806 --> 38:29.724
Bit shy.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.351
I mean, come on,
that was really good. [chuckles]

38:32.435 --> 38:36.355
So, if your cake is incredibly delicious,
you still might survive.

38:36.439 --> 38:39.317
Brandi, the cake is really rich.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.320
I love the textural elements
with the pecans,

38:42.403 --> 38:44.238
but it was hard to eat the chocolate.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.448
Okay.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.868
[Andrew] Nina and Hannah, 
it was a little bit on the sweet side.

38:48.951 --> 38:51.662
I think something
maybe a little bit acidic to cut through.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.290
Coming to your boat though,
your hull is stunning.

38:54.373 --> 38:56.917
It does look like a model boat
you'd see in a museum.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.085
Thank you.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.962
Randi, the flavors are delicious.

39:00.546 --> 39:04.091
I feel like the cake could use
a little bit of a soaking syrup.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.968
I'd actually add a little bit more salt

39:06.052 --> 39:09.096
just to really bring out
the mint and the chocolate flavors.

39:09.597 --> 39:10.973
Thank you guys very much.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.808
-Vanessa, Shanice.
-[contestants cheering]

39:14.643 --> 39:19.648
Our sailboat today is actually 99% edible,
so we're pushing the edible with this one.

39:20.566 --> 39:22.068
[Justin] Let's start the party.

39:23.527 --> 39:24.445
[Shanice] Come on.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.280
[all cheering]

39:26.364 --> 39:27.490
[Shanice] Oh, my God.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.449
[Andrew] Yes!

39:29.867 --> 39:31.202
[Shanice] Come on!

39:31.285 --> 39:33.704
-[laughs] Come on!
-[Joanne] Yes!

39:33.788 --> 39:36.248
-Whoo!
-[all cheering]

39:36.332 --> 39:37.583
[Shanice] Come on!

39:38.626 --> 39:39.794
[all cheering]

39:42.380 --> 39:46.467
As far as the hydrodynamics goes
and the engineering, it was flawless.

39:46.550 --> 39:50.137
-Thank you. [laughs]
-Vanessa, we're excited to try the cake.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.723
It's really a lovely cake.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.558
The crumb is so fine.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.727
The filling is a little bit runny.

39:56.811 --> 39:59.105
I actually think taking egg yolk

39:59.188 --> 40:02.400
and making an Anglaise,
instead of using corn syrup,

40:02.483 --> 40:04.193
just gives it a nicer flavor.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.363
From a design perspective,
it looks unfinished.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.950
Overall, in terms of looking realistic,

40:11.033 --> 40:13.160
I think you could
bring it up a notch next time.

40:14.620 --> 40:18.582
Thank you so much.
Up next, Sierra and Edwin.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.626
[upbeat music playing]

40:20.709 --> 40:23.379
Welcome aboard the Good Ship Lollipop.

40:23.462 --> 40:24.797
[Joanne laughs]

40:24.880 --> 40:27.675
[Edwin] It's one of the first songs
Sierra learned from her mother--

40:27.758 --> 40:30.302
-And love so much. [chuckles]
-Aww.

40:30.386 --> 40:33.931
Our boat is made out of
Rice Krispies treats, covered with ganache

40:34.014 --> 40:35.558
and white modeling chocolate,

40:35.641 --> 40:37.977
and is propelled by a golden sail

40:38.060 --> 40:40.479
of seaweed and wafer paper.

40:41.021 --> 40:41.897
Let's go sailing.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.399
-All right.
-[Sierra] It's heavy.

40:43.482 --> 40:44.984
-She's a heavy one.
-[Sierra chuckles]

40:45.568 --> 40:49.697
-All right. So you wanna--
-Fire up the fans in three, two, one.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.412
-[Sierra] Whoa!
-[groans]

41:01.459 --> 41:02.710
[contestants groaning]

41:05.004 --> 41:05.921
[Sierra] Oh!

41:09.925 --> 41:11.260
It's a hard no.

41:11.343 --> 41:12.303
Yeah.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.305
It's like Titanic with a keel.

41:17.308 --> 41:21.687
You know, Sierra and Edwin, I predicted,
when I saw that cake in my head,

41:21.770 --> 41:25.149
that if that cake makes it a foot
in that tank, I'm gonna be surprised.

41:25.232 --> 41:30.237
It hit the laws of physics.
Because you had a solid Rice Krispie hull

41:30.321 --> 41:32.698
and you put a large mass on top,

41:32.781 --> 41:36.243
any movement to the side
would move your center of mass,

41:36.327 --> 41:38.954
which was very high, from over your base.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.624
I think you realized this
as soon as it went in the water,

41:41.707 --> 41:42.833
it was top-heavy.

41:42.917 --> 41:45.711
So, you perhaps
should've thought a bit more about

41:45.794 --> 41:49.381
those bakineering materials.
It really was up against the elements.

41:53.844 --> 41:58.182
It's a vanilla cake.
It's soaked in a coconut rum simple syrup

41:58.265 --> 42:00.226
and then you have a pineapple filling

42:00.309 --> 42:02.895
-and a salted coconut lime buttercream.
-[Joanne] Mmm.

42:02.978 --> 42:06.232
Sierra, this cake is so moist,

42:06.732 --> 42:08.567
really tender, really buttery.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.194
I like the freshness of the lime.

42:10.277 --> 42:12.363
-I wish there was more pineapple.
-[Sierra] Yeah.

42:12.446 --> 42:16.158
I feel like that would've really helped
counterbalance the sweetness.

42:16.242 --> 42:18.327
Using this kind of buttercream,

42:18.410 --> 42:21.121
the downside of it is
it can be a little cloying.

42:21.705 --> 42:24.083
The one thing is,
I didn't see a lot of variety

42:24.166 --> 42:26.877
in terms of pastry technique
across your boat.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.921
I was hoping to see a little bit more

42:29.004 --> 42:32.716
in terms of different types
of chocolate, maybe,

42:32.800 --> 42:34.552
or different types of sugar work.

42:34.635 --> 42:37.179
Something to really showcase
your pastry skill.

42:38.180 --> 42:40.349
-Sierra, Edwin. Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

42:40.432 --> 42:41.475
That was a blast.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.186
[Renee] Good job, guys.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.313
Now, time for you to do your stress test.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.275
So, you go make a decision.
I'll hang with you guys.

42:52.278 --> 42:55.948
I'm really heartbroken because
I'm worried that I let Steve down.

42:56.031 --> 42:58.993
[Steve] You learn from your mistakes.
That's how most people get better.

42:59.076 --> 43:01.662
But this mistake
could have cost us everything,

43:01.745 --> 43:03.581
but, hopefully, it didn't

43:03.664 --> 43:06.041
and we can move forward
in a positive mind.

43:07.042 --> 43:08.002
You have a decision?

43:08.085 --> 43:10.838
-We have a decision.
-Teams, follow me.

43:12.089 --> 43:13.299
[dramatic music playing]

43:20.806 --> 43:25.811
For every team, we scored you with a pass
and a fail in each of our disciplines,

43:26.478 --> 43:29.273
engineering, baking and bakineering.

43:29.815 --> 43:32.484
But there can only be one winning team.

43:35.529 --> 43:38.032
The winning team today
showed us exquisite detail,

43:38.115 --> 43:39.867
a lot of bakineering skills,

43:39.950 --> 43:41.660
and sailed to success.

43:41.744 --> 43:45.789
And that team will be earning
a big advantage in the next mission.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.458
And, unfortunately,

43:47.541 --> 43:51.337
the team that was least successful
in today's mission will be going home.

43:51.837 --> 43:54.465
Just a reminder
that you're all fighting for a chance

43:54.548 --> 43:55.966
to get to our final mission,

43:56.050 --> 43:59.678
and that only one team can win
the $100,000

43:59.762 --> 44:02.931
and the title of World's Best Bakineers.

44:06.352 --> 44:07.895
[Justin] And the winning team

44:07.978 --> 44:09.938
who earns a colossal advantage

44:10.022 --> 44:12.816
in the next mission is

44:13.734 --> 44:17.488
going to be revealed
by our cutting-edge cake-printing device.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.203
The winning team is…

44:24.286 --> 44:25.496
[upbeat music playing]

44:30.209 --> 44:32.378
-[all cheering]
-[Justin] …Cindy and Taylor!

44:33.754 --> 44:35.130
Congratulations.

44:35.631 --> 44:38.467
Cindy and Taylor,
your whimsy won the day.

44:39.635 --> 44:42.429
You engineered your boat
to near-perfection.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.890
The hydrodynamics, the sails,

44:44.973 --> 44:47.685
the rudder design,
you did it like it was easy.

44:47.768 --> 44:49.311
Yay!

44:49.395 --> 44:50.229
Congrats.

44:50.312 --> 44:51.188
Thank you.

44:51.814 --> 44:56.151
Which means, unfortunately, we have
some serious business to attend to.

44:57.444 --> 44:59.571
[Andrew] Sadly, one bakineering duo

44:59.655 --> 45:02.241
from the losing course
will be going home today.

45:02.324 --> 45:03.992
[Justin] It's come down to two teams,

45:04.076 --> 45:07.413
and for our judges
this was actually a very tough decision.

45:07.496 --> 45:08.706
[dramatic music playing]

45:14.044 --> 45:15.504
Sierra and Edwin.

45:16.755 --> 45:18.382
And Joey and Mario.

45:18.966 --> 45:21.719
Sorry to say,
but based on our judges' scoring,

45:22.344 --> 45:24.930
both of your teams
failed the mission today.

45:27.141 --> 45:30.519
The team going home today is…

45:34.898 --> 45:36.358
…Sierra and Edwin.

45:37.693 --> 45:40.279
I'm so sorry. This was your final mission.

45:42.281 --> 45:43.574
You did good. It's okay.

45:43.657 --> 45:44.533
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

45:44.616 --> 45:46.076
[contestants applauding]

45:48.036 --> 45:50.789
It was wonderful
that you were able to pull together

45:50.873 --> 45:52.750
and collaborate to get that final design,

45:52.833 --> 45:56.378
but, sadly, your change of design
meant that your boat was unstable

45:56.462 --> 45:58.797
from the beginning
and you didn't have time to test.

45:58.881 --> 46:01.091
Your boat was just too heavy.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.969
It was doomed to fail
as soon as it hit the water.

46:04.553 --> 46:06.430
-[Sierra] Thank you.
-Thank you so much, guys.

46:06.513 --> 46:07.973
[Sierra] Bye, guys. [chuckles]

46:08.098 --> 46:11.518
It's been an absolute pleasure
and an honor to bakineer with you guys,

46:11.602 --> 46:13.562
and especially with you, Sierra.

46:14.730 --> 46:15.606
Thanks, Eddie.

46:15.689 --> 46:19.067
I'm feeling emotional, but I think
failure is one of our greatest teachers.

46:19.151 --> 46:20.444
[cheering continues]

46:20.527 --> 46:22.404
[Sierra] No one ever wins without failing.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.448
It's just been-- [chuckles]

46:24.531 --> 46:26.492
It's been a great time.
We had so much fun.

46:26.575 --> 46:29.495
I mean,
such a unique opportunity and experience.

46:29.578 --> 46:32.456
I'm not gonna stop bakineering.
I mean, once I've tasted it,

46:32.539 --> 46:33.665
-I'm hooked.
-[Sierra] Yay!

46:38.504 --> 46:40.297
Cindy and Taylor, congratulations.

46:40.380 --> 46:43.801
You earned an advantage for the
next mission, which I will tell you soon.

46:43.884 --> 46:48.347
Guys, we'll see you for the next mission
where someone's gonna be doing the robot.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.765
Show them the robot.

46:50.390 --> 46:51.683
-That's--
-[all laugh]

46:51.767 --> 46:53.602
[Justin] Okay. We're gonna work on it.

46:56.647 --> 46:57.898
And that next mission

46:57.981 --> 47:01.151
is gonna start right now.

47:01.735 --> 47:05.948
[female announcer] Mission launch
in three, two, one.

47:06.031 --> 47:07.241
-Go.
-Go! This is not a trick.

47:07.324 --> 47:08.408
The clock's ticking.

47:09.117 --> 47:10.869
-Oh, my God.
-Where are we going?
