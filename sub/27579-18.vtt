00:36.804 --> 00:39.338

Waking up this early

01:37.765 --> 01:42.668

01:52.947 --> 01:56.182
No, no. This is
about your origins.

Oh, you mean that
I am Gabrielle's corpse

01:58.251 --> 02:00.888

by the living energy
of a dead Mother Box.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.522
Yes, that.

02:03.557 --> 02:07.661
The ramifications
created some concerns.

02:07.694 --> 02:11.764
So, I tested hair follicles
from your hair brush

02:11.799 --> 02:14.699

no easy way to say this.

I can heal myself.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.512
But your cells are not
regenerating as they should.

02:58.544 --> 03:02.382
Every time you use
your Violet aura
to heal a new wound,

03:02.382 --> 03:06.520
it is at the expense
of your overall health.

03:06.551 --> 03:08.889
At your current rate
of deterioration,

03:08.920 --> 03:11.456

a few months left.

-So, it's up to you

03:23.704 --> 03:27.574

03:45.626 --> 03:48.026
The mission is, potentially,
too public for the team,

03:48.062 --> 03:51.698
and neither the U.N. nor Cuba
would allow the Justice League
to intervene.

I said try it, not kill it.

14:16.490 --> 14:20.090
(COUGHING) I don't kill.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.677
I have a boyfriend.

Put it down!

Drop it.

Thank you.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.658
What will you do
with these others?

15:26.692 --> 15:29.394
Those with family in Cuba
can stay, of course.

15:29.427 --> 15:32.700
But many of these kids
were trafficked here
from other countries.

15:32.731 --> 15:35.134
They'll be given
the opportunity to go home

15:35.168 --> 15:37.336
or they can come
to the meta-human youth center

15:37.370 --> 15:39.306
in Taos, New Mexico.

15:39.339 --> 15:42.042
Either way,
we've got them covered.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.644
-Much better catchphrase.
-You Justice Leaguers
should not be here!

15:45.677 --> 15:49.014
Hey, the League's cool,
but we're Outsiders.

15:49.048 --> 15:52.052

to do the right thing
for kids like us.

You can't expect to know
the counter for every attack

16:55.716 --> 16:58.183
Okay, let's try again.

16:58.216 --> 17:00.187
But don't just focus
on my eyes.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.288
That might work against
an untrained fighter,

17:02.322 --> 17:04.490
but not against
an experienced foe.

17:04.525 --> 17:07.461
Be aware of my entire body,
hips included.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.261
You'll learn to see the tells,
to anticipate what's coming.

17:10.297 --> 17:13.164
-I know that.
-Do you?

17:13.200 --> 17:15.634
I mean, I'm sorry.

17:15.669 --> 17:17.836
I appreciate what you're
trying to teach me.

17:20.605 --> 17:25.211
Look, I get it.
You have bad memories
associated with training.

17:25.243 --> 17:26.645
Training? Me?

17:26.680 --> 17:29.481
Before your cage match
with Holocaust,

17:29.516 --> 17:32.751
seemed like someone
had given you a few tips,
if brutally.

17:33.854 --> 17:38.223
Yes, my training
was a bit rough.

17:38.258 --> 17:42.528
I understand. Trust me.
My dad, Sportsmaster,

17:42.563 --> 17:43.762
he was just like that.

17:43.797 --> 17:46.199
Borderline abusive
on good days.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.233
But that's not my style.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.505
So, go again?

17:52.771 --> 17:54.240
Yes.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.577
I appreciate
the call, Bethany.

17:58.612 --> 18:00.211
I'll make sure she gets home.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.615

he wasn't already here.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.795
-And?
-We left a message,

18:14.826 --> 18:17.163
but Harper's staying
in a holding cell

18:17.195 --> 18:22.195
until dear old Dad
comes to get her.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.778

what happened, or why?

Got some newbies for you.
Ramp, please.

-Good work.
-There's one more.

Okay, Bio Ship,
show us the hold.

Uh, the center
is not equipped
for water breathers.

19:56.895 --> 19:59.598
Yeah, in to the Outsiders.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.402
Seriously? You were never
into the whole hero thing.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.002
I know. But the three of us

20:04.038 --> 20:05.771
were talking
after the funeral,

20:05.806 --> 20:09.342
and this is something I need
to do for the kids here.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.309
What part of
"We got you covered"

20:11.344 --> 20:13.747
didn't cover them?
Them especially.

20:13.779 --> 20:17.584
You guys are great,
but Brion's a prince
and Gar's a TV star.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.519
You three are
clearly legacies,

20:19.553 --> 20:21.622
and the kids here
just don't know you.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.490
Great. Thanks.

20:23.521 --> 20:27.626
Sorry, but they need to see
one of their own on the squad.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.596

at "I want in."

20:30.631 --> 20:35.279
-All those in favor.

gonna be okay with this?
