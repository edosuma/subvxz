01:34.281 --> 01:37.515
THE EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN TERMINATED.

01:37.615 --> 01:41.416
- THE NEXUS IS GONE, BUT THE DANGER STILL EXISTS.

01:41.516 --> 01:44.449
IF WE ARE TO RESTORE THE DAMAGE TO THE TIME FLOW,

01:44.549 --> 01:48.550
WE MUST SEND A NEW MISSION.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.719

A LITTLE MORE DEFENSE AND MAYBE WASPINATOR

02:43.893 --> 02:46.160
NOT GET BLOWN UP ALL THE TIME.

02:46.260 --> 02:50.694

03:36.135 --> 03:39.468
TELL ME WHY TARANTULAS TRIED TO DESTROY THE ARK.

03:39.568 --> 03:42.369
- WELL, I--I PLAIN DON'T KNOW.

03:42.469 --> 03:46.870

I APPLAUD YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS,

03:57.105 --> 04:00.139

HEY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU BOTS?

07:48.910 --> 07:50.710
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING!

07:50.811 --> 07:52.744
THAT FLAMING HUNK OF SPACE JUNK

07:52.844 --> 07:55.144
JUST SOLVED ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS.

07:55.244 --> 07:56.244

09:59.032 --> 10:01.065
SO NOW CAN WE PAR-TAY?

10:01.165 --> 10:03.532
- RHINOX, CALL CHEETOR TO THESE COORDINATES,

10:03.632 --> 10:06.300
AND TELL HIM NOT TO ENGAGE UNTIL I GET THERE.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.366
I JUST HOPE I'M IN TIME.

10:08.467 --> 10:09.834

10:12.800 --> 10:16.401
YOU'RE JUMPING IN TO HELP MEGAJERK?

10:16.501 --> 10:19.935

IF HE'S DESTROYED, THERE'LL BE A TIME STORM,

10:22.069 --> 10:24.036
WHICH COULD WIPE OUT CYBERTRON AS WE KNOW IT.

10:28.870 --> 10:32.838
WHERE DO YOU THINK HE'S COMING NEXT?

- JUST WHEN THINGS ARE FINALLY LOOKING UP.

10:36.038 --> 10:38.338
[laughs]

10:38.438 --> 10:40.839
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.

10:44.306 --> 10:48.006
- MEGATRON, I GIVE YOU A FINAL CHANCE.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.740
SURRENDER OR BE TERMINATED.

10:53.074 --> 10:54.974

- AAH! - [laughs]

11:38.648 --> 11:44.649
[both growling]

11:47.916 --> 11:50.584

12:43.059 --> 12:44.726
I MEAN YOU NO HARM.

12:44.826 --> 12:47.960
- THE VOK KNOW YOU WELL, OPTIMUS PRIMAL.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.060
WE'LL SPEAK WHEN MY PRIMARY PROGRAMMING IS COMPLETED.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.127
[gun cocks]

12:52.227 --> 12:54.461
- I CANNOT LET YOU DESTROY MEGATRON.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.361
- HIS DISRUPTION OF TIME AND SPACE MUST END

12:57.461 --> 12:59.962
BEFORE THE DAMAGE GROWS GREATER.

13:00.062 --> 13:02.629
- DESTROY HIM, AND YOU'LL ONLY MAKE THINGS WORSE.

13:02.729 --> 13:06.796
- INTERFERENCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.

13:13.064 --> 13:16.065

15:50.290 --> 15:53.091
THE VOK KNOW YOU ALL TOO WELL!

15:53.191 --> 15:54.557

15:54.657 --> 15:57.992
A SIMPLE NAME FOR SO ARROGANT A RACE.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.791
- [struggling]

16:00.892 --> 16:02.425
- KEEP STRUGGLING IF YOU LIKE!

16:02.526 --> 16:04.292
IN A FEW KLIKS, MY DATATRAX

16:04.392 --> 16:06.659
WILL DESTROY THE ALIEN INFLUENCE WITHIN YOU,

16:06.759 --> 16:09.260

16:47.366 --> 16:49.699
- YOU HAVE LITTLE CHOICE.

16:49.799 --> 16:51.800
AND WHILE YOU DEAL WITH THE MAXIMALS,

16:51.901 --> 16:55.001
I WILL COMPLETE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ARK.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.034
- YOU CAN'T!

16:56.134 --> 16:58.301
THE TIME STORM FROM SUCH AN ACTION

16:58.401 --> 17:00.735
WOULD WIPE OUT YOUR ENTIRE RACE.

17:00.835 --> 17:04.235
- ONLY THOSE DESCENDED FROM AUTOBOT AND DECEPTICON,

17:04.335 --> 17:06.203
BUT I AND THE TRIPREDACUS COUNCIL

17:06.303 --> 17:07.537
HAVE DIFFERENT ORIGINS.

17:07.636 --> 17:12.470
UNDER OUR RULE, CYBERTRON WILL CONQUER THE UNIVERSE
