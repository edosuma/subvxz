WEBVTT

00:01.174 --> 00:02.566
Previously on Halo.

00:02.610 --> 00:04.177
This is where I lived.

00:04.220 --> 00:05.526
Can you show me what
the house used to look like?

00:06.962 --> 00:08.964
I saw you in my house.

00:09.008 --> 00:11.011
-Can it be our secret?
-Why were you here?

00:11.025 --> 00:13.273
You were so young
and overwhelmed with grief.

00:13.316 --> 00:15.362
I took care of you.

00:15.405 --> 00:16.841
Your father spent

00:16.885 --> 00:18.539
everything we had
on the revolution.

00:18.582 --> 00:20.845
And when the money ran out,
so did the people.

00:20.889 --> 00:23.631
He died to save me. I have
to pick up where he left off.

00:23.674 --> 00:26.373
We're about to have Vinsher's
entire army on our ass.

00:26.416 --> 00:28.418
Let's go.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.884
Bad news.
Your ship's scrapped.

00:30.908 --> 00:33.374
If you're looking for
the fastest way off Madrigal,

00:33.417 --> 00:37.819
transport ships take off
200 miles due south.

00:37.862 --> 00:39.516
The hormonal pellet
in your spine

00:39.560 --> 00:41.041
suppresses emotional responses

00:41.064 --> 00:42.527
and protects mission readiness.

00:42.551 --> 00:44.478
It's part of what
makes you a Spartan.

00:44.521 --> 00:47.524
Ch'anggagomo.
Sacred ring.

00:47.568 --> 00:49.249
Do you think that's what
the Covenant are talking about?

00:49.313 --> 00:51.354
Halo?

00:51.398 --> 00:53.791
Where did the Demon
take my keystone?

00:53.835 --> 00:55.358
I will tell you nothing.

01:00.102 --> 01:02.583
The second object is here,
on Eridanus.

01:02.626 --> 01:04.498
And I know where it is.

01:14.943 --> 01:17.250
This way takes us past
the administrative buildings

01:17.293 --> 01:18.947
to what we call
the Elysium Fields.

01:18.990 --> 01:21.341
It's here where
the learning happens.

01:21.384 --> 01:23.995
The focus is on
a nature-based education,

01:24.039 --> 01:26.676
grounding technology
to the soil.

01:26.709 --> 01:28.232
Parisa, Katrina,

01:28.275 --> 01:29.740
-good morning.
-Good morning.

01:29.784 --> 01:31.307
The plantings
look beautiful.

01:32.830 --> 01:34.876
The colonial insurrection
touched everyone,

01:34.919 --> 01:37.444
even here on our little
out-of-the-way planet.

01:37.487 --> 01:40.708
It's made the Reach for Life
mission that much more urgent.

01:40.751 --> 01:42.710
But you must know all that,
or you wouldn't have chosen

01:42.753 --> 01:44.277
to settle your family here.

01:45.887 --> 01:47.758
Did the children find
the transition difficult?

01:47.802 --> 01:48.866
Just the opposite.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.675
They've inherited their parents'
pioneer spirit.

01:51.719 --> 01:54.287
You can see how dedicated
they are to creation of life.

01:55.723 --> 01:57.768
They also like to have fun.

01:57.812 --> 01:59.857
Is that all you got, Roland?

02:01.772 --> 02:03.948
-Stop it!
-What, you scared?

02:03.992 --> 02:07.474
-Aah!

02:07.517 --> 02:09.084
-Oh, look! Over there!
-John!

02:09.128 --> 02:11.391
-Help.

02:12.783 --> 02:13.828
Please!

02:13.871 --> 02:15.090
Pull me up!

02:15.134 --> 02:18.137
John! John! John!

02:18.180 --> 02:19.790
-Pull him up!
-Pull him up!

02:22.750 --> 02:24.447
Are you okay?

02:28.016 --> 02:30.018
That was amazing!

02:33.152 --> 02:35.066
Sometimes too much fun.

02:36.764 --> 02:39.680
Well, what do you think
of our little school?

02:42.310 --> 02:43.684
I think it's wonderful.

02:45.164 --> 02:47.427
How about you, darling?
Wh-what do you think?

02:47.470 --> 02:49.733
Yeah. Yes, seems good. Yeah.

02:49.777 --> 02:51.605
I'll take you back
by way of the aviary.

02:51.648 --> 02:53.172
Our scientists
are introducing all kinds

02:53.215 --> 02:54.901
of bird species to the colony.

02:54.945 --> 02:56.436
Oh, great.

03:13.714 --> 03:15.846
Dr. Keyes.

03:15.890 --> 03:17.805
If there's nothing else
you require,

03:17.848 --> 03:21.455
we've been ordered to rejoin
Master Chief on the ground.

03:21.519 --> 03:22.620
Very well.

03:23.724 --> 03:25.421
Good luck out there, Kai.

03:25.465 --> 03:26.857
You too, ma'am.

03:26.901 --> 03:28.642
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

03:39.566 --> 03:41.655
Welcome to Eridanus.

03:41.698 --> 03:43.613
Just in time.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.094
What's Halsey doing,
setting up her own colony?

03:46.137 --> 03:47.443
Come on, get in.

03:50.751 --> 03:53.536
With all the money she's spent
on this temporary camp,

03:53.580 --> 03:55.538
you'd think Halsey
could figure out

03:55.582 --> 03:58.454
how to get the artifact
out of the rock.

03:58.498 --> 04:01.109
-What's the problem?
-If she knows, she isn't saying.

04:01.152 --> 04:02.763
That's why I called for you.

04:02.806 --> 04:04.895
I hear you're running
your own team now.

04:04.939 --> 04:09.160
I figure it's time to show
everybody what you can do.

04:09.204 --> 04:10.597
Including your mother.

04:13.252 --> 04:14.557
Thanks.

04:18.213 --> 04:19.780
Where is she now?

04:19.823 --> 04:21.477
In the cave,

04:21.521 --> 04:23.262
with her new
prized possession.

04:47.634 --> 04:51.127
Master Chief,
about this artifact.

04:51.181 --> 04:52.682
Analysis of its field physics

04:52.726 --> 04:54.510
suggests the energy
it can produce

04:54.554 --> 04:56.904
is far greater than that
of the Madrigal artifact.

04:56.947 --> 04:59.123
Not surprising,
considering its size.

05:01.254 --> 05:02.518
Chief?

05:02.562 --> 05:05.608
John, did you hear
what Cortana said?

05:05.652 --> 05:08.655
There's a serious safety issue
for you and for others.

05:08.698 --> 05:10.091
Until I've run
some more tests,

05:10.134 --> 05:12.311
I'd like you
to stay away from it.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.834
Understood?

06:25.906 --> 06:27.211
Take my ship

06:27.255 --> 06:29.388
and expect me
to be okay with that.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.390
What, I'm supposed
to buy it back as scrap?

06:31.433 --> 06:34.044
My money and time
I'm puttin' in that girl.

06:34.088 --> 06:35.306
No, sir.

06:39.746 --> 06:41.356
Come on!

06:45.708 --> 06:46.709
Shit.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.630
Oh.
Well, that's just great!

06:54.674 --> 06:57.372
Nice work. Now what?

06:57.416 --> 07:00.680
We'll be back on the Rubble
in the morning.

07:00.723 --> 07:03.378
Really? 'Cause it doesn't look
like we're going anywhere.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.293
Oh, yes, we are.

07:08.949 --> 07:10.820
We are not gonna miss
that transport ship.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.692
-Well, you can go.

07:12.735 --> 07:14.650
I'm not done here.

07:14.694 --> 07:16.435
Hey, I'm going
to free Madrigal

07:16.478 --> 07:18.654
even if I'm the only one
left to fight.

07:18.698 --> 07:22.266
That was beautiful.
Really.

07:22.310 --> 07:24.834
But your freedom-fighter days
are over.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.923
You belong to me now.

07:26.967 --> 07:28.621
Wait, what?

07:28.664 --> 07:30.057
You can't do this.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.711
You owe me!

07:31.754 --> 07:34.191
One ship and a shitload
of deuterium money.

07:34.235 --> 07:36.237
You gon' work off that debt.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.934
Who knows?

07:37.978 --> 07:40.328
Might make a half-decent pirate
out of you.

07:40.371 --> 07:42.069
Where are you going?

07:42.112 --> 07:44.680
To find us another set
of wheels!

07:44.724 --> 07:47.291
Transport ship's over
a hundred miles from here.

07:47.335 --> 07:50.294
And what am I supposed
to do here?

07:50.338 --> 07:52.340
Watch out
for the creepy crawlies!

07:54.124 --> 07:55.299
Asshole!

08:10.967 --> 08:13.403
Congratulations,
you found it.

08:13.447 --> 08:14.971
Yes.

08:15.015 --> 08:17.761
Estimate on how long
it'll take to cut it out?

08:17.785 --> 08:19.367
I don't think
it will take that long.

08:19.410 --> 08:21.717
-Adun, what do you think?
-Not very long, Doctor.

08:21.761 --> 08:23.719
You know, this
crystal substrate is too clear

08:23.763 --> 08:25.155
to be naturally occurring.

08:25.199 --> 08:26.809
I'd love to do
some tests on it.

08:26.853 --> 08:28.724
It could serve a purpose
we're not yet aware of.

08:28.768 --> 08:30.204
-Adun.
-Yes, Doctor.

08:30.247 --> 08:31.835
I'd like to compare
the phases

08:31.859 --> 08:35.053
of the latent energy fields
of both pieces. Look.

08:36.076 --> 08:38.821
I think we'll find
that the nodes

08:38.865 --> 08:40.823
intersect at predictable
intervals.

08:40.867 --> 08:41.868
Yeah.

08:45.219 --> 08:47.504
Once they've got
the artifact out of the rock,

08:47.558 --> 08:50.006
our mission is to get it
on board Pioneer

08:50.050 --> 08:51.747
as quickly as possible,

08:51.791 --> 08:54.184
before the Covenant
figures out we're here.

08:54.228 --> 08:56.687
As soon as the artifact
is on board,

08:56.700 --> 08:58.188
Chief wants it up
into slipspace

08:58.232 --> 09:00.277
and on its way back to Reach.

09:00.321 --> 09:03.403
-Hey. Vannak.
-Hmm?

09:03.446 --> 09:04.760
Do you ever wonder
what they want?

09:04.804 --> 09:06.980
-Who?
-Covenant.

09:07.023 --> 09:09.417
They want
what's in that cave.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.071
Yeah, but what
do they really want?

09:11.114 --> 09:14.422
To kill us,
like we want to kill them.

09:14.465 --> 09:16.206
Do you ever wonder why?

09:16.250 --> 09:17.425
No.

09:17.468 --> 09:19.079
Move out!

09:25.433 --> 09:28.915
Do you ever wonder
why you never wonder why?

09:36.923 --> 09:39.882
I wonder if all that
gun grease in your hair

09:39.926 --> 09:42.015
didn't seep down
into your brain,

09:42.058 --> 09:44.104
asking me dumb-ass
questions like that.

10:21.184 --> 10:22.446
What are you looking at?

10:24.840 --> 10:26.842
Oh, yes.
I noticed that too.

10:26.886 --> 10:28.452
It's a nice color on her.

10:38.985 --> 10:41.335
Negative.

10:41.378 --> 10:44.294
Kai. With me.

10:44.338 --> 10:46.383
And... go. Okay.

10:50.474 --> 10:52.128
Chief, what's up?

10:53.347 --> 10:54.522
Take off your helmet.

10:54.565 --> 10:56.176
Why?

10:57.699 --> 10:59.353
Take it off.

11:01.355 --> 11:04.010
Delta Team,
group for recon in 30 minutes.

11:04.053 --> 11:07.274
Delta Team, group
for recon in 30 minutes.

11:07.317 --> 11:10.448
When did you remove
your pellet?

11:10.501 --> 11:11.996
After I saw you
remove yours.

11:12.059 --> 11:14.542
-Oh, Kai.
-No, I get it now.

11:14.585 --> 11:18.415
Our whole lives, all we've seen
is targets and missions.

11:18.459 --> 11:19.590
But now...

11:21.418 --> 11:23.986
things I'm seeing, John...

11:24.030 --> 11:28.251
and the more they're in me,
the more it makes me want...

11:28.295 --> 11:29.905
I...

11:29.949 --> 11:31.254
I don't know.

11:32.952 --> 11:35.153
Do you have the words for this?

11:35.216 --> 11:37.043
I can't clear you
for combat, Kai.

11:39.045 --> 11:41.047
-Why?
-You're distracted.

11:41.090 --> 11:42.596
-I'm awake.
-You're a danger to yourself

11:42.639 --> 11:43.663
and to others.

11:43.677 --> 11:44.978
Chief, I haven't forgotten
how to fight.

11:45.002 --> 11:47.125
You're grounded, Kai.

11:47.168 --> 11:48.663
Report back
to Dr. Keyes's ship,

11:48.707 --> 11:51.405
and don't step off
until we get back to Reach.

11:51.448 --> 11:53.102
...sure it's
in A-1 order, you got that?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.451
Yes, sir!

11:54.495 --> 11:55.975
What about you?

11:56.018 --> 11:57.405
You removed your pellet.

11:57.448 --> 12:00.196
If I'm so dangerous,
what's that make you?

12:01.328 --> 12:02.590
Alpha Team!

12:08.905 --> 12:10.040
She's right.

12:10.093 --> 12:11.642
Your battle readiness
hasn't been tested

12:11.686 --> 12:13.557
since you removed your pellet.

12:13.601 --> 12:15.168
Can I just say
that I'm proud of Kai

12:15.211 --> 12:16.735
for standing up for herself.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.258
Studies show
a little pushback is healthy

12:18.301 --> 12:19.999
in any working relationship.

12:20.042 --> 12:22.001
-Cortana?
-Yes, Chief.

12:22.044 --> 12:23.567
I need you to do me a favor.

12:23.611 --> 12:27.006
-Anything.
-Stop talking.

12:27.049 --> 12:29.356
Can't hear myself think.

12:29.399 --> 12:32.098
Well, I can,
and you're not missing much.

13:49.175 --> 13:50.476
Come on.

14:05.869 --> 14:07.497
Aah!

14:46.406 --> 14:47.711
Shit!

15:01.464 --> 15:03.463
Dr. Halsey was in my home.

15:04.772 --> 15:06.382
And my parents
were still alive.

15:10.169 --> 15:12.301
You learned this
from the artifact?

15:14.684 --> 15:16.566
The memories are real, sir.

15:18.631 --> 15:19.743
So, what does it all mean?

15:20.962 --> 15:23.356
Not sure yet...

15:23.399 --> 15:25.358
other than the fact
that she's been lying to me.

15:30.239 --> 15:32.721
And you've spoken to her
directly about this?

15:32.745 --> 15:34.758
No, I came to you first.

15:34.802 --> 15:37.718
You're my captain.
You've always been there for me.

15:41.635 --> 15:42.853
I need to know the truth...

15:44.464 --> 15:45.595
sir.

15:48.816 --> 15:51.039
Chief, you and I

15:51.072 --> 15:53.777
have fought alongside
each other for many years.

15:55.649 --> 15:58.130
None of us would even be here
were it not for you.

15:59.435 --> 16:02.134
Your concerns
are my concerns.

16:03.831 --> 16:05.659
Let's get this artifact home.

16:08.444 --> 16:10.533
I will look into this
personally.

16:12.753 --> 16:14.320
I promise you.

16:16.278 --> 16:17.410
Thank you, sir.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.968
So, what are we
going to do about John?

16:32.011 --> 16:34.775
I cannot afford a Spartan
with an identity crisis.

16:34.818 --> 16:37.060
-It's under control.
-No, it's not.

16:37.074 --> 16:39.155
John remembers Catherine
in his house

16:39.189 --> 16:41.584
while his parents
were alive.

16:41.647 --> 16:43.392
You promised the committee

16:43.436 --> 16:45.655
that Cortana would keep 1-1-7
under control,

16:45.699 --> 16:49.485
and yet he continues to have
these dangerous memories.

16:49.529 --> 16:53.315
It's these dangerous memories
that have brought us here.

16:53.359 --> 16:56.014
Margaret, we are so close
to finding this weapon.

16:56.057 --> 16:59.452
Weapon? We don't even know
if it is a weapon.

16:59.495 --> 17:01.628
Personally,
I'm not convinced.

17:01.671 --> 17:03.760
You always have
your own agenda.

17:03.804 --> 17:05.161
You're willing
to tell the committee

17:05.204 --> 17:06.937
anything they need to hear

17:06.981 --> 17:09.592
as long as you get
what you want.

17:09.636 --> 17:11.594
And now you've put
all of us at risk.

17:11.638 --> 17:13.553
I'm cutting you off.

17:15.855 --> 17:19.655
I wonder what Admiral Hood
will have to say about that.

17:19.718 --> 17:22.365
What does Hood
have to do with all this?

17:22.409 --> 17:23.693
Nothing yet.

17:23.737 --> 17:25.520
But if the whole truth
is revealed,

17:25.565 --> 17:27.915
he'll obviously be worried
about his own liability.

17:27.958 --> 17:29.786
He'll be looking
for a scapegoat.

17:29.830 --> 17:33.834
Are you really trying
to blackmail us?

17:33.877 --> 17:36.663
John's memories are incomplete,

17:36.706 --> 17:38.795
and I intend
to keep them that way.

17:38.839 --> 17:40.536
He will operate as designed,

17:40.580 --> 17:45.000
and he will bring us
the weapon that wins this war.

17:45.034 --> 17:48.066
I want Miranda
taken off the entire project.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.242
Her hands are clean.
I want to keep them that way.

17:50.285 --> 17:51.678
Good.

17:51.721 --> 17:55.088
Finally a parenting issue
we can agree upon.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.465
Handle it.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.727
I am.

18:12.438 --> 18:14.483
Kitchen
situation nominal.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.359
Well, watch out, now.

18:24.058 --> 18:25.712
I'm looking
at the vector matrix.

19:12.411 --> 19:13.673
Blessed One.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.496
What was that? Ohh!

20:16.475 --> 20:18.172
My God.

20:19.316 --> 20:21.718
This is incredible.

20:21.741 --> 20:24.004
The noise that came from
the artifact wasn't random, Dad.

20:24.047 --> 20:26.394
-So, what was it?
-It was a signal.

20:27.007 --> 20:29.328
Warning? Keep us away?

20:29.352 --> 20:30.880
Or it was communicating.

20:30.924 --> 20:33.660
-To who?
-Or what?

20:33.703 --> 20:35.145
It's possible that the artifact

20:35.189 --> 20:37.485
isn't two halves
of the same weapon,

20:37.498 --> 20:41.935
but some other kind of device
altogether.

20:41.978 --> 20:44.503
Miranda, you're being
taken off the project.

20:59.169 --> 21:00.910
I hear you're making
great advancements

21:00.954 --> 21:03.217
with linguistic research.

21:03.261 --> 21:05.132
Stick with that.

21:05.175 --> 21:07.047
But the artifact
stays with Halsey.

21:09.486 --> 21:11.704
-I don't understand.
-It's best you don't.

21:16.796 --> 21:19.015
What the hell happened to you
the past few hours?

21:20.147 --> 21:21.540
Meaning?

21:22.802 --> 21:25.400
I get Halsey's games.

21:25.454 --> 21:26.980
No one does it better.
But...

21:28.634 --> 21:29.983
what are you doing?

21:30.026 --> 21:32.812
I am on your side.
Always. You know that.

21:32.855 --> 21:34.814
Then why would you
let her do this to me?

21:34.857 --> 21:36.489
This isn't about you.

21:36.553 --> 21:37.556
No.

21:39.862 --> 21:40.994
No, it's...

21:42.300 --> 21:43.605
it's about you.

21:49.045 --> 21:50.830
What has she got on you?

21:56.096 --> 21:57.837
Doctor...

21:57.880 --> 22:00.013
cease all work on the project,
effective immediately.

22:00.056 --> 22:01.580
That is an order.

22:06.236 --> 22:07.542
Yes, sir.

22:19.685 --> 22:21.077
All right, so,
I want you to get a truck

22:21.121 --> 22:22.992
and get some big, big, thick
straps for it.

22:23.036 --> 22:25.647
-All right? Please.
-Well, thank you.

22:36.658 --> 22:37.833
Cortana.

22:37.877 --> 22:39.618
Still here.

22:39.661 --> 22:42.577
You have access to the entirety
of human knowledge, isn't that right?

22:42.621 --> 22:44.100
With room to spare.

22:44.144 --> 22:46.581
Every piece of data
the UNSC has ever amassed.

22:46.625 --> 22:48.017
Collected, cataloged,

22:48.061 --> 22:49.715
and filed
for instant retrieval.

22:49.758 --> 22:51.414
Great.

22:51.447 --> 22:53.109
Tell me about my adoption.

22:53.153 --> 22:55.634
I told you, all files
from the plague were lost.

22:55.677 --> 22:57.766
I wasn't lost.
I'm right here.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.899
-Where's my file?
-It's fine, all right?

22:59.942 --> 23:02.162
I touched it,
but nothing happened, all right?

23:02.205 --> 23:06.122
I'm sorry, Chief, there's
nothing in the database.

23:06.166 --> 23:07.863
Get that crane over here!

23:07.907 --> 23:09.561
What about the other Spartans?

23:09.604 --> 23:11.127
There are no archives

23:11.171 --> 23:13.042
on the origin
of the Spartan program.

23:13.086 --> 23:15.131
Why not?

23:15.175 --> 23:16.394
I don't know.

23:20.354 --> 23:22.182
You don't know.

23:22.225 --> 23:23.357
Hmm.

23:26.273 --> 23:27.666
Chief, what are you doing?

23:27.709 --> 23:29.058
It's the only one way to know.

23:29.102 --> 23:30.712
The artifact could kill you.

23:32.555 --> 23:33.697
Don't!

23:47.729 --> 23:49.612
I think he's still awake.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.906
Get him out of here.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.745
No!

24:06.182 --> 24:07.793
-Leave me alone!
-It's okay.

24:07.836 --> 24:09.708
Let me go!

24:20.414 --> 24:21.676
John.

24:26.202 --> 24:27.900
You kidnapped me.

24:29.031 --> 24:31.120
You replaced me with something.

24:31.164 --> 24:33.688
You need to listen to me.

24:33.732 --> 24:35.647
I know you have
a lot of questions.

24:37.344 --> 24:40.869
And together,
we will find the answers.

24:42.175 --> 24:43.829
But for now,

24:43.872 --> 24:47.180
we need to get back to Reach
with the artifact,

24:47.223 --> 24:51.227
and I promise I will explain
everything, okay?

25:00.454 --> 25:03.065
-Cortana!

25:03.109 --> 25:05.198
Shutting down neural bridge.

26:12.091 --> 26:13.527
Son of a bitch.

27:10.540 --> 27:11.933
-Chief.

27:11.977 --> 27:13.282
What-- what happened?

27:13.326 --> 27:14.936
I shut you down.

27:14.980 --> 27:16.808
You can do that?

27:16.851 --> 27:18.505
I needed to protect
Dr. Halsey,

27:18.548 --> 27:20.638
and your decision-making
was compromised.

27:20.681 --> 27:23.012
You're lucky to be alive.

27:23.026 --> 27:24.206
Please don't get up.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.121
I need to run
a systems diagnostic.

27:26.165 --> 27:27.470
Where is she?

27:27.514 --> 27:29.342
I can't tell you that.

27:29.385 --> 27:31.605
Cortana, I swear,
if you don't get out of my head,

27:31.649 --> 27:33.476
-I will--
-Slipspace rupture detected.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.179
Incoming.

27:50.972 --> 27:52.931
Ma'am,
get this ship out of here!

27:52.974 --> 27:55.107
No, I'm not going anywhere.
They might need us.

27:55.150 --> 27:57.500
Pioneer's been hit.
We have no air support.

27:57.544 --> 27:59.285
-Then join the fight!
-Yes, ma'am!

28:10.688 --> 28:12.124
Take cover!

28:13.560 --> 28:15.518
Sergeant!
Air cover! Go!

28:15.562 --> 28:16.785
Yes, sir!

28:25.572 --> 28:28.995
No! No!

28:29.058 --> 28:30.403
No, no, no, no, no!

28:35.582 --> 28:37.453
-Pioneer's falling!
-Shit!

28:41.196 --> 28:44.326
Jacob. Pioneer's gone
and the crane is destroyed.

28:44.349 --> 28:47.333
Our ships are too big to get
the artifact out of the canyon.

28:47.376 --> 28:49.204
You're gonna have
to bring it to us.

28:50.553 --> 28:52.686
Miranda's ship
is the closest.

28:52.730 --> 28:54.383
Roger that!

28:54.427 --> 28:56.281
Chief, orders
are to get the artifact

28:56.324 --> 28:57.560
to Dr. Keyes's ship.

28:57.604 --> 29:00.346
Move, move, move!
Let's go!

29:03.305 --> 29:04.611
Chief!

29:04.654 --> 29:06.439
Get all noncombatants
into the cave!

29:06.482 --> 29:07.657
Yes, sir!

29:07.701 --> 29:10.871
Casualties into the cave now!

29:10.914 --> 29:12.575
The artifact
stays with me!

29:12.619 --> 29:14.664
No! The artifact
stays with me!

29:19.104 --> 29:22.303
Chief! It's at least
half a click straightaway

29:22.337 --> 29:23.761
before you can take the turn
up the hill.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.501
You'll be running right at 'em.

29:25.545 --> 29:28.461
Understood.
Riz, Vannak, up front with me.

29:28.504 --> 29:30.071
-Chief!
-Kai...

29:30.115 --> 29:31.464
stay back with the Marines,
keep us covered.

29:31.507 --> 29:32.639
Yes, Chief.

29:37.513 --> 29:38.732
On me!

29:43.128 --> 29:45.347
More Banshees
inbound!

29:45.391 --> 29:47.175
Acknowledged.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.612
Pod doors opening.
Infantry incoming.

29:58.665 --> 30:00.493
Two--
no, three Covenant Lances

30:00.536 --> 30:02.538
in our escape path.

30:02.582 --> 30:05.367
Jackal at two o'clock.
Two more flanking right.

30:08.718 --> 30:10.285
Switch to secondary.

30:10.329 --> 30:13.134
I know how the game
is played, Cortana.

30:13.168 --> 30:14.724
Riz, Vannak, break their lines.

30:14.768 --> 30:16.770
Copy.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.522
Mind if I drive?

30:32.873 --> 30:34.396
Spartans, get in.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.572
Runnin' to you, Chief.

30:36.616 --> 30:37.617
On my way.

30:43.101 --> 30:46.017
Captain, I'm moving
upslope to the landing zone.

30:54.494 --> 30:56.027
C'mon, help me out,
Private!

31:05.863 --> 31:07.777
Miranda!

31:10.606 --> 31:12.043
Attention! Drop ship!

31:21.617 --> 31:23.576
Marines, form up behind me!

31:33.238 --> 31:35.066
-Riz!
-On it!

31:44.902 --> 31:46.338
Drop the ramp.

31:48.557 --> 31:52.213
John, you need to
bring that artifact to me now!

31:52.257 --> 31:53.388
Roger that.

31:55.651 --> 31:56.783
Miranda!

32:04.878 --> 32:07.707
Come on. Come on!

32:41.696 --> 32:43.512
Kai's hurt.
Take the wheel.

32:43.535 --> 32:44.700
Chief, don't do this.

32:44.744 --> 32:46.155
You need
to protect the artifact.

32:46.228 --> 32:48.269
Vannak, get me closer
to the edge.

32:48.313 --> 32:50.141
...three plus four!

32:50.184 --> 32:53.254
Stop this right now!

32:53.328 --> 32:55.233
John!
Stay on mission!

32:55.276 --> 32:56.277
I can't let her die.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.355
Ha!

34:42.818 --> 34:44.255
Hang on, Kai.

35:00.619 --> 35:01.750
Chief!

35:01.794 --> 35:03.883
Chief, stop. Stop.

35:12.372 --> 35:15.424
Chief, the artifact.

35:15.438 --> 35:17.462
Covenant Spirit incoming!

35:41.834 --> 35:44.576
Cortana... I'm gonna
need a weapon.

35:44.619 --> 35:46.024
Not sure it'll help.

36:33.102 --> 36:36.149
-Kai.
-Kai.

36:36.193 --> 36:38.543
Do you copy?

36:38.586 --> 36:40.153
Kai, are you with me?

36:45.811 --> 36:48.683
Chief, I'm reading
a human life form.
