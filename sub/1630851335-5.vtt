00:05.798 --> 00:10.010
"More than 85% of people wish to make
their sexual fantasies come true.

00:10.052 --> 00:12.138
Only 20% actually do it."

00:20.479 --> 00:22.398
Sergio, what are you doing here?

00:23.190 --> 00:24.942
I can't take you out of my mind.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.626
Don't answer your phone.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.213
It's your phone.

00:59.894 --> 01:00.978
Hi, Barbs.

01:01.437 --> 01:02.688
What's up?

01:03.147 --> 01:04.482
Guess where I am?

01:05.441 --> 01:07.359
- Where?
- In my bathtub.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.488
You know how long
it's been since I've had a tub bath?

01:12.156 --> 01:13.407
The nanny...

01:13.657 --> 01:15.701
served them dinner...

01:15.910 --> 01:17.995
bathed them, tucked them in.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.039
This Spanish nanny works miracles.

01:20.498 --> 01:23.417
- Great.
- Hey, am I interrupting?

01:24.210 --> 01:27.213
No. I was just...

01:27.630 --> 01:28.798
taking a shower.

01:29.465 --> 01:33.219
You know? Leo and I played
a role-playing game.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.972
I was a hooker and he was my client.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.558
- Just like you hear it.
- So?

01:40.059 --> 01:42.394
- How was it?
- Amazing.

01:42.728 --> 01:43.938
Pleasant.

01:44.188 --> 01:47.024
I put on heels, tights, makeup.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.360
Bárbara, please. Stop.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.488
Don't say a word.
Lately all I think about is sex.

01:53.072 --> 01:55.783
Me too. You should try it.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.661
Hey. Listen.
On a different subject.

01:59.870 --> 02:03.207
Tomorrow, it's ladies night
for Mica's birthday.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.209
Don't worry.
I'll be at the office.

02:06.043 --> 02:09.672
But just consider it.
You could surprise Óscar.

02:10.673 --> 02:12.049
That's a good idea.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.807
THE GAME OF KEYS

02:20.349 --> 02:22.768
I hate working in an office.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.062
I've been indoors for hours.

02:25.271 --> 02:29.191
Siena, I've been locked up
for hours like cattle.

02:29.275 --> 02:32.278
Clocking in and out.
It really sucks.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.989
I know
how to help you relieve stress.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.908
- A blowjob?
- That too.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.704
- A new session of the Game of Keys.
- Really?

02:42.288 --> 02:46.876
I will invite my friends
and you invite yours.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.379
We'll be more
and it'll get more exciting.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.047
Or what?

02:52.798 --> 02:56.135
Are you giving up
on your school crush?

02:58.137 --> 03:00.389
You are my crush.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.350
But it's okay. Arrange it.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.611
- How's Sergio doing at the office?
- Fine.

03:14.695 --> 03:18.574
I was surprised.
He came up with the motto.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.326
Did he?

03:21.619 --> 03:23.537
Share it with me.

03:24.788 --> 03:28.000
"Lady... Just for you."

03:30.210 --> 03:31.337
I like it.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.380
It sounds nice.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.050
I think it'll work.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.138
I just didn't like that he...

03:41.597 --> 03:43.265
kept on saying...

03:43.933 --> 03:46.143
"Adriana needs new experiences."

03:46.560 --> 03:49.813
"Adriana's needs are not being met."

03:50.356 --> 03:53.150
Like your life is really boring.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.986
Really?

03:57.029 --> 03:59.990
And why were you two talking
about me?

04:00.491 --> 04:03.202
You two talk a lot, too.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.079
Especially about the Game of Keys.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.750
- You want to know what Gaby said?
- Fuck!

04:13.087 --> 04:14.338
What did she say?

04:15.381 --> 04:16.674
Nothing.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.304
I'm joking, honey.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.475
Wouldn't you like to have more fun?

04:27.309 --> 04:30.354
- Wouldn't you like to play?
- I don't want to play again.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.524
- I don't mean the Game of Keys.
- So?

04:35.192 --> 04:38.737
Bárbara told me she and Leo
played a role-playing game.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.032
She dressed up like a prostitute
and he pretended to be her client.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.411
Really?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.747
She said it was very rewarding.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.044
We could try that.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.213
It would be nice...

04:57.172 --> 04:59.883
that we could make
our sexual fantasies true.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.512
Like Cosplay?

05:05.139 --> 05:06.432
Right...

05:06.849 --> 05:08.058
Like that.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.478
I've always wanted to try it.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.191
I can tell you
what character I'll choose.

05:16.275 --> 05:19.111
No. Please, don't tell me.
I don't need to know.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.489
I have an idea.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.451
We can meet at a bar.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.370
In a fancy hotel.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.873
You can book a room.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.876
We pretend we don't know each other.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.130
You approach me...

05:38.338 --> 05:40.841
You flirt with me
with your sexy voice...

05:41.300 --> 05:42.968
You order a martini for me.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.598
Then, we can go to the room
and do whatever you want.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.601
I like that.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.941
When you really want
to learn something,

05:59.526 --> 06:01.653
you can always go back to classics.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.155
Henry Miller.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.366
Marquis of Sade.

06:09.078 --> 06:10.454
The Kama Sutra.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.499
I spent the whole afternoon studying.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.920
Come here,

06:18.212 --> 06:21.882
and prove me your expertise.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.143
Do you feel like some S&M?

06:33.811 --> 06:35.395
We could use handcuffs.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.564
We play master and slave.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.025
Pleasant pain.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.863
Let's try some S&M.

06:48.659 --> 06:49.868
Kids!

06:50.119 --> 06:52.079
- You should be in bed.
- What's S&M?

06:52.538 --> 06:53.664
I want to play!

06:53.747 --> 06:57.793
S&M is a game involving
a puppy and a dragon...

06:57.876 --> 07:00.963
- And goats, lots of goats.
- It's not for kids.

07:02.131 --> 07:04.341
That's enough! Go back to bed!

07:04.466 --> 07:07.344
You need to go back to bed.
You have school tomorrow.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.805
- You are too young.
- "S&M!"

07:09.888 --> 07:12.141
- Go back to bed!
- "S&M!"

07:12.224 --> 07:15.185
Listen. Go back to bed right now,
or I'll call Carmen.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.478
Good night.

07:23.152 --> 07:24.236
Did the trick.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.863
So what, puppy?

07:26.488 --> 07:28.782
Shall I introduce you to my dragon?

07:29.158 --> 07:30.284
Please.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.871
Come with me. He's hungry.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.337
I won't tell anything,
I'm a gentleman.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.423
Really?

07:46.884 --> 07:50.429
Do you know who wasn't
a perfect gentleman to me?

07:51.263 --> 07:52.222
Who?

07:54.349 --> 07:55.434
Óscar.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.478
- He wasn't?
- On the contrary.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.272
He was...

08:01.648 --> 08:02.941
wild.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.152
Outrageously wild.

08:07.696 --> 08:11.575
First... I stared at him.
He was huge!

08:12.993 --> 08:15.120
Then I felt him between my legs.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.624
And inside me.

08:18.832 --> 08:22.336
It's funny. His penis
is kind of leaning to the left.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.046
Like bending?

08:25.047 --> 08:27.174
And that increased the pleasure.

08:29.384 --> 08:33.430
Look. Seems like
someone wants to play.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.350
- Tell me more.
- He shoved it.

08:36.725 --> 08:41.313
He shoved his penis into me
again... and again.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.066
I clung to his ass.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.777
And he had his hands all over me.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.447
And we came together.

08:51.323 --> 08:55.035
It was extremely pleasant.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.940
Tell them to call back on Thursday.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.778
Kids, it's time for breakfast.
Right now.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.113
Help me.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.533
Kids, please.
Do as your mother says.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.953
Eat breakfast now,
or you'll suffer the consequences.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.080
I'm glad you're here, Carmen.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.583
Good morning.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.422
Carmen.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.966
The kids will be vaccinated
at school.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.927
They might run a fever,
watch them.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.971
- I will, madam.
- I hate shots.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.849
I want to stay home
and play "S&M" with Carmen.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.144
- They shouldn't watch TV.
- We don't.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.770
You and Mom were playing last night.

10:03.854 --> 10:04.771
- Kids.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.691
Eat your breakfast
and don't disrespect your parents.

10:07.983 --> 10:11.320
If I hear just another word,
I'll change your Wi-Fi password.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.454
I finished my juice.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.084
Have you been a bad boy?

10:29.755 --> 10:31.548
What are we going to do about it?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.136
Sir?

10:36.595 --> 10:37.804
Would you like more coffee?

10:39.473 --> 10:41.433
- No, thanks.
- Shall we go, darling?

10:41.933 --> 10:42.976
Yes, babe.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.982
- Have you seen my cell phone?
- Yes, honey.

10:53.195 --> 10:54.237
Excuse me.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.324
Behave yourselves.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.660
Let's go.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.287
Let's go.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.165
Give me the keys.
I'll drive, ma'am.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.670
Do as I say,
or you'll suffer the consequences.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.882
- What kind of consequences?
- Sexual.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.717
- Really?
- Fuck!

11:17.260 --> 11:18.387
Get in!

11:18.762 --> 11:22.057
- I like it.
- And you'll like it more, just wait.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.901
- Oh, no! No. I don't want to.
- What's wrong, Mica?

11:32.984 --> 11:34.236
I don't want to.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.531
It's going to be
a great experience.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.825
We are going to have fun.
Come on.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.369
It's my birthday, Mom.
Not yours.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.497
You are right.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.208
But I'll tell you what.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.169
Why don't we go inside?
They'll make us beautiful.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.629
Let's enjoy this moment together.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.091
And then we can go to Comic World
and buy anything you want.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.342
Deal?

11:58.635 --> 12:01.763
- Anything I want?
- Just because it's your birthday.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.730
Why is a woman like you alone
in this place?

12:52.981 --> 12:54.483
It could be dangerous.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.693
I've got a license to kill.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.112
Where do you hide your weapon?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.116
You'd love to find out.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.037
I'm carrying the weapon this time.

13:08.413 --> 13:11.333
You won't run away from me
like you did in Hong Kong.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.460
You think?

13:14.002 --> 13:15.795
Hold me tight then.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.800
Done.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.385
You're ready now.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.306
- I love your look.
- Me too.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.183
You look so beautiful.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.020
You're right sometimes.

13:32.103 --> 13:35.190
I am.
You could listen to me more.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.484
- I know.
- Wait a second.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.198
Mom!
Vanessa and Paola are there.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.618
- Mom?
- Sure, honey.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.913
HI. I AND SIENA ARE THROWING A PARTY.
BRING YOUR KEYS. ARE YOU IN?

13:49.996 --> 13:53.875
I'D LOVE TO.
BUT ÓSCAR WON'T AGREE.

13:54.209 --> 13:59.422
DON'T WORRY. I'LL TAKE CARE OF ÓSCAR.
WE NEED TO PLAY AGAIN

14:02.300 --> 14:04.594
I made some changes to the layout.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.012
I'll be right there.

14:17.691 --> 14:21.695
- Is Martínez your history teacher?
- Yes. And he is so boring.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.447
- I know.
- His voice makes me fall asleep.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.534
Three guys in my classroom
were in a coma.

14:28.285 --> 14:32.038
We needed pallets
to wake one of them up.

14:32.414 --> 14:34.207
Everyone was like, "Clear."

14:38.211 --> 14:41.715
"When Hernán Cortés
arrived in Veracruz..."

14:46.761 --> 14:47.679
Hey?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.849
That look suits you.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.143
- You look... different.
- Thanks.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.272
Hi, there!

14:57.606 --> 15:00.317
Hi, girls. How are you?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.943
- We're fine.
- Hello.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.821
Why don't you introduce me
to this cute boy, Mica?

15:05.905 --> 15:09.242
- This is Claudio, from school, Mom.
- Really?

15:10.076 --> 15:13.079
Nice to meet you, Claudio.
I'm Adriana.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.915
- Nice to meet you, madam.
- Call me Adriana, please.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.961
You look nice together.

15:20.795 --> 15:23.256
I mean it.
You should have a date.

15:23.340 --> 15:26.384
Shut up, Mom.
See you tomorrow at school.

15:26.718 --> 15:30.680
- Bye!
- You're welcome anytime.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.558
- Nice to meet you, Claudio!
- You too, madam.

15:34.976 --> 15:35.935
Mica.

15:36.811 --> 15:37.771
Mica!

15:38.104 --> 15:39.147
Mica, stop!

15:40.190 --> 15:42.192
That was so humiliating, Mom.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.526
You made me look like...

15:43.902 --> 15:46.988
an idiot in front of the coolest guy
in school.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.990
What did I do?

15:49.908 --> 15:52.160
"You should date Mica,
she's desperate."

15:52.285 --> 15:53.745
"You're welcome anytime."

15:53.828 --> 15:56.498
I didn't mean... Wait a second.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.375
Mica. I'm sorry.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.920
- I didn't mean...
- Best birthday ever, Mom.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.052
I can't believe it.

16:15.934 --> 16:18.395
"Lady... Just for you."

16:21.898 --> 16:23.983
It sounds nice. Good job.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.528
Well, then...

16:27.195 --> 16:29.322
Talk to the designers...

16:30.824 --> 16:34.077
and you can submit a sketch...

16:39.541 --> 16:41.876
- on Monday?
- Count on it.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.923
I told you.
Everything's under control.

16:47.465 --> 16:50.135
We did great.
We need to celebrate.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.011
Any suggestions?

16:52.387 --> 16:55.223
Siena and I are planning
a new Game of Keys this weekend.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.268
And she's inviting
her hottest friends.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.480
- Forget it!
- Just give it some thought.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.858
They are influencers.

17:05.275 --> 17:08.319
They spend all day practicing yoga
and eating seeds.

17:08.403 --> 17:12.282
Imagine lustful girls
with perfect bodies

17:12.365 --> 17:14.868
admiring your primal body.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.912
- Wouldn't that be great?
- It would. But I don't think so.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.123
After Adriana's reaction last time...

17:20.206 --> 17:21.583
I texted her. She's cool.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.418
Is she?

17:25.670 --> 17:29.382
Anyway, Adriana and I
need to talk about it.

17:30.884 --> 17:31.926
Listen.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.387
She wants to play again.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.765
And if you don't give her a chance,

17:36.848 --> 17:39.267
she'll never forgive you
for fucking her best friend.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.145
I'm just saying. Think it over.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.868
LOGIN

18:42.330 --> 18:43.915
HANDSOME GUYS

19:34.132 --> 19:36.175
- Hello!
- Hi, babe.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.052
What's that?
Are those for me?

19:38.678 --> 19:41.222
I know you like sunflowers,
and I stopped by the flower stand.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.099
I'm casting a vase.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.352
Were you inspired by Dalí?

19:47.854 --> 19:49.188
You really know me.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.609
- Here.
- Thanks, babe.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.278
- They are beautiful.
- Thanks.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.031
Mary?

19:59.490 --> 20:02.452
Thanks for my tea.
Can you put them in water?

20:02.911 --> 20:04.037
Thanks.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.705
CAN WE MEET AT BRONSON'S?

20:05.788 --> 20:07.040
Shall we have dinner?

20:09.751 --> 20:10.877
I can't.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.880
I'll meet some friends.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.381
What friends?

20:15.840 --> 20:18.760
Guys who want
to support the foundation.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.095
- That's nice!
- It is!

20:21.679 --> 20:23.973
- I hope they give you tons of money.
- I hope so.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.099
Okay.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.061
- Have fun.
- Love you.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.980
Me too.
Tell Mary to feed Chata, please.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.358
I will. Bye, babe.

20:50.541 --> 20:51.376
Hello.

20:53.628 --> 20:54.587
Big Óscar.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.550
Whisky, please.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.458
Thanks.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.520
Martini, please.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.710
I'm Alex.

22:16.753 --> 22:17.837
I'm Valentín.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.007
Valentín?

22:23.009 --> 22:25.053
You look different in your pictures.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.180
That's a stock photo.

22:28.639 --> 22:29.682
I guess...

22:30.892 --> 22:33.436
I'm kind of shy and scared.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.646
It's my first time.

22:36.731 --> 22:37.774
So sweet.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.403
You're safe with me.
I don't bite.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.032
Well...

22:47.575 --> 22:48.743
I do sometimes.

23:20.942 --> 23:24.403
Look at her, man!
I just can't fucking believe my eyes!

23:32.662 --> 23:34.622
You're so beautiful.
Are you alone?

23:34.997 --> 23:36.874
No. I'm waiting for my man.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.752
Would you join us while you wait?

23:39.961 --> 23:42.296
No. I'm fine.

23:42.964 --> 23:45.508
He hates
when strangers mess with his girl.

23:46.384 --> 23:49.804
- I'm so scared now.
- Well, you should.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.264
- Really?
- Yes.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.933
He's excellent with his fists.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.352
If you know what I mean.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.820
She turned me down.

24:11.576 --> 24:12.994
Are you alone?

24:13.161 --> 24:15.288
- Óscar!
- It could be dangerous.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.460
Are you kidding me?

24:22.086 --> 24:24.922
Pay the check, please.
And let's get out of here. Now!

24:28.134 --> 24:29.177
Adriana?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.140
Adriana!

24:39.270 --> 24:40.271
Adriana!

24:41.230 --> 24:42.648
Aren't we going upstairs?

24:43.232 --> 24:44.525
Are you kidding me?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.486
You said it would be like Cosplay.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.240
- Can you see my dress?
- Yes.

24:51.908 --> 24:56.037
I wished you'd look sexy.
That you'd wear a tuxedo.

24:56.287 --> 24:59.373
Or at least a simple suit.

25:00.208 --> 25:04.295
Or something!
But not like a superhero.

25:04.378 --> 25:05.713
I'm Super Python.

25:05.963 --> 25:06.964
What?

25:07.173 --> 25:08.966
- I didn't know!
- It's so embarrassing.

25:09.050 --> 25:12.220
You wanted role-playing, didn't you?
So I bought myself a costume.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.723
- We agreed to meet in the bar.
- Come here!

25:15.806 --> 25:17.350
Come back here!
I'm talking to you!

25:24.148 --> 25:27.610
You are right.
I should've explained myself.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.278
Fine.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.406
Something is wrong with us.
Can't you see?

25:33.199 --> 25:36.118
I mean, nothing is working out.

25:39.872 --> 25:43.125
My cab is 10 minutes away!

25:44.377 --> 25:47.213
Sergio and Siena are planning
another Game of Keys.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.717
If that's important to you...

25:52.260 --> 25:53.386
we can join them.

26:03.813 --> 26:04.814
Okay.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.692
We can go, if you want.

26:12.989 --> 26:15.658
- What did you wear?
- Forget about that.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.576
What did he wear?

26:18.744 --> 26:19.912
A superhero costume.

26:20.121 --> 26:24.250
Really? Who wants to have sex
with a superhero?

26:24.375 --> 26:25.334
I do.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.004
Oh, come on.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.590
I would gladly have sex
with Aquaman and Thor.

26:32.133 --> 26:35.469
- I would, too.
- Well, of course.

26:35.678 --> 26:39.181
But Óscar wore
a Super Python costume!

26:40.391 --> 26:43.311
- What's that?
- I don't know! See?

26:43.769 --> 26:45.980
At least you play.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.190
We do nothing.

26:48.357 --> 26:52.611
I tried to ask Valentín
how it was with you.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.030
And he said nothing.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.657
Did something weird happen?

26:58.284 --> 27:00.453
He ordered some really good oysters.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.663
- He love them.
- Really good.

27:04.248 --> 27:07.043
By the way, did Sergio text you

27:07.376 --> 27:09.962
the invitation
to the next Game of Keys?

27:10.921 --> 27:11.839
He did.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.387
So? Aren't you going?

27:41.077 --> 27:43.037
- Hi.
- Hello.

27:45.247 --> 27:46.916
I'm glad you are here.

27:57.468 --> 27:58.969
We are complete now.
