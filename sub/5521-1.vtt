02:03.430 --> 02:06.307
Um, Dr. Dutten,

02:06.308 --> 02:08.434
- my aunt's in town.
- Mm-hmm.

02:08.435 --> 02:10.603
And she's sick, too.

02:10.604 --> 02:12.897
I'm gonna need you to stay late tonight.

02:12.898 --> 02:14.899
- Oh. You are?
- You know, you should probably

02:14.900 --> 02:16.609
text your Aunt Scotty

02:16.610 --> 02:19.237
and tell him you can't make it
to the baseball game today.

02:19.238 --> 02:20.905
Wait a second.

02:20.906 --> 02:23.241
- Okay, look, Scotty and I, we're not...
- Oh, come on, Becca.

02:23.242 --> 02:25.284
- I mean...
- It's the worse-kept secret in town.

02:25.285 --> 02:27.286
Now, that is saying a lot.

02:27.287 --> 02:29.747
Go on.
Get outta here.

02:29.748 --> 02:31.082
Go have some fun.

02:31.083 --> 02:33.793
Thanks, Dr. Dutten.

02:47.808 --> 02:50.768
Well, I don't care what the calendar says.

02:50.769 --> 02:52.854
Opening day...
That's the first day of spring.

02:52.855 --> 02:55.982
No,no,no.
The sheriff never pays for coffee.

02:55.983 --> 02:57.942
Well, that's kind of you, Ben.

02:57.943 --> 03:00.152
But the principal still has to pay
his parking tickets.

03:01.154 --> 03:02.822
- Start him a tab.
- Yes, sir.

03:10.789 --> 03:12.748
Kid throws fast.

03:12.749 --> 03:14.500
Just like he drives.

03:14.501 --> 03:17.336
Nice pitch, Scotty.

03:17.337 --> 03:20.090
Come on, man! Come on, guys!

03:23.635 --> 03:25.136
Strike two!

03:25.137 --> 03:27.806
Whoo! Yeah!

03:39.902 --> 03:42.529
Center field.

03:44.907 --> 03:47.117
Oh, Jesus Christ.

03:53.540 --> 03:55.541
- Stay there.
- What's he doing?

03:55.542 --> 03:57.168
- Boys, get in the dugout.
- Move it off.

03:57.169 --> 03:58.878
- Get off!
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

03:58.879 --> 04:01.088
Get them off the field.

04:01.089 --> 04:02.673
Get them in the dugout, Principal.

04:02.674 --> 04:05.259
Rory. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:05.260 --> 04:08.262
Hey, Rory, we got
a ballgame going on here.

04:08.263 --> 04:10.598
We're playing ball,
and you come out with a gun?

04:10.599 --> 04:13.684
What the hell are you doing?

04:13.685 --> 04:15.519
Aw, Ror.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.064
You're drunk, that's all.

04:18.065 --> 04:21.276
All right? Let's just lay the gun down.

04:22.945 --> 04:25.905
Rory, lay the gun down.

04:25.906 --> 04:29.033
Hmm? Lay it down.

04:30.994 --> 04:33.371
Hell, Rory, come on.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:33.372 --> 04:34.789
Rory?

04:37.584 --> 04:40.753
Now, you lay that gun down.

04:44.925 --> 04:46.718
Rory?

04:49.972 --> 04:52.390
Oh, my God.

05:26.758 --> 05:29.427
I'll have blood alcohol for you in the morning.

05:31.138 --> 05:33.139
A full tox screen will take about a week.

05:35.434 --> 05:37.936
How are you holding up, David?

05:39.604 --> 05:41.439
Peggy here yet?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.942
She just walked in with her boy.

05:46.319 --> 05:50.406
David, perhaps now is not the best time.

05:51.616 --> 05:54.661
Son, settle down.

05:56.163 --> 05:58.665
Hey, Curt.

05:59.374 --> 06:01.459
Uh...

06:01.460 --> 06:03.836
I'm so sorry.

06:05.714 --> 06:07.590
I liked Rory. I liked him a lot.

06:07.591 --> 06:09.884
What was he doing out there?

06:10.510 --> 06:12.470
He had been drinking, that's all.

06:12.471 --> 06:13.971
Rory quit two years ago.

06:13.972 --> 06:17.141
You know how proud he was of that.

06:17.142 --> 06:20.061
Is that what you're saying,
that he was drunk?

06:20.062 --> 06:22.480
- Is that what you're telling people?
- No.

06:22.481 --> 06:26.401
That you had to do it...
had to shoot the town drunk.

07:59.578 --> 08:02.288
You did the right thing.

08:04.624 --> 08:06.458
I need a new blade for this.

08:06.459 --> 08:09.420
Hey, David.

08:10.589 --> 08:13.925
You did the right thing.

08:26.646 --> 08:28.981
You should be sleeping.

08:38.241 --> 08:40.241
Sheriff's Department.

08:40.243 --> 08:41.910
No, ma'am,
we can't comment on that.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.747
That's an ongoing investigation.

08:44.748 --> 08:47.791
No, ma'am, the sheriff
is not here right now,

08:47.792 --> 08:50.794
but I can see if the deputy will...

08:50.795 --> 08:54.465
Amateur.

08:54.466 --> 08:58.052
Sheriff's Department.
Mm-hmm.

08:58.053 --> 09:02.181
That's the medical examiner on line two.

09:04.809 --> 09:07.311
Morning, Jim.
What have we got?

09:07.312 --> 09:10.314
<i>The toxicology reports are in.
The results are negative.</i>

09:10.315 --> 09:12.024
<i>- Come again?
- There was no alcohol</i>

09:12.025 --> 09:14.485
No, I heard what you said,
Jim, but that's not right.

09:14.486 --> 09:18.113
<i>- Rory was...
- David, we did the test twice.</i>

09:18.114 --> 09:20.866
<i>Rory wasn't drunk.
There was no alcohol in his bloodstream.</i>

09:20.867 --> 09:24.078
<i>We'll get the drug results
back in a couple of days, maybe a week.</i>

09:24.079 --> 09:25.913
Yeah, okay.

09:25.914 --> 09:27.957
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.501
<i>Do you want this car...</i>

09:32.254 --> 09:34.505
<i>Bring it down here.</i>

09:59.322 --> 10:00.823
Ben?

10:02.200 --> 10:03.826
Ben!

10:07.414 --> 10:09.791
Hey.

10:12.460 --> 10:15.588
Hey, Ben. Ben!

10:16.589 --> 10:18.173
Ben!

10:18.174 --> 10:20.760
Hey. You all right?

10:23.888 --> 10:26.557
Don't worry. The, uh...

10:26.558 --> 10:28.642
kids are resilient.

10:28.643 --> 10:30.686
They're gonna be all right.

10:30.687 --> 10:32.688
Yeah.

10:32.689 --> 10:35.191
I'm late. I gotta go.

10:36.735 --> 10:39.111
- Deardra. Bill.
- Hey, Judy.

10:39.112 --> 10:41.780
Little man.
How y'all doing?

10:41.781 --> 10:44.074
Uh, would you mind
taking a look at Bill?

10:44.075 --> 10:46.076
- Sure. What's wrong?
- I don't know.

10:46.077 --> 10:49.830
He's just...
He's not right.

10:53.209 --> 10:55.753
How are you feeling, Bill?

10:55.754 --> 10:58.631
Any pain or discomfort?

10:59.674 --> 11:01.633
Bill?

11:01.634 --> 11:04.553
She worries too much. I'm fine.

11:04.554 --> 11:06.638
Just a little tired.

11:06.639 --> 11:08.891
You got any plans this weekend?

11:10.226 --> 11:13.145
She worries too much. I'm fine.

11:13.146 --> 11:15.814
Just a little tired.

11:15.815 --> 11:18.108
His Vitals are fine.

11:18.109 --> 11:21.779
But, you know, I've gotta see a patient
in Cedar Rapids on Monday.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.947
I wanna take Bill in to get a CT scan.

11:23.948 --> 11:25.324
- Monday?
- Yeah.

11:25.325 --> 11:28.494
Let's just make sure it's nothing serious.

11:28.495 --> 11:29.995
- Okay.
- Okay?

11:29.996 --> 11:31.789
You need me, you call me.

11:31.790 --> 11:33.207
Day or night.

11:33.208 --> 11:34.375
- Okay?
- Thanks, Judy.

11:34.376 --> 11:35.959
See you, Nicholas.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.838
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Bill!

12:16.459 --> 12:19.295
What's Dad doing?

12:20.672 --> 12:23.341
Wait here, Nicholas.

12:56.916 --> 12:59.210
William!

13:04.591 --> 13:06.342
William?

13:13.600 --> 13:16.227
William, what are you doing?

13:43.588 --> 13:45.423
William?

13:51.930 --> 13:53.514
William!

13:53.932 --> 13:56.600
Oh, God.

13:56.601 --> 13:58.853
Nicholas!

14:04.943 --> 14:07.403
Nicholas?

14:13.535 --> 14:16.078
Nicholas.

14:19.415 --> 14:20.916
Nicholas!

14:30.093 --> 14:32.136
- Nicholas, are you okay?
- Shh, shh.

14:35.181 --> 14:37.641
Nicholas, what happened?

14:38.768 --> 14:40.143
It's Dad.

14:40.144 --> 14:42.437
Wh-Where's Dad?

14:42.438 --> 14:44.398
What happened?

14:44.399 --> 14:45.983
Honey, please, talk to me.

14:45.984 --> 14:48.527
Please.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.822
He has a knife.

14:52.657 --> 14:55.117
Oh, my God.

14:59.539 --> 15:01.081
Stay back.

15:01.082 --> 15:02.624
Stay right there.

15:41.122 --> 15:43.541
William!

15:44.375 --> 15:46.043
William!

15:55.762 --> 15:57.972
William!

15:59.182 --> 16:02.810
William, please, don't do this!

16:03.978 --> 16:07.106
William, please let us out!

16:30.296 --> 16:32.214
Hello.

16:32.215 --> 16:34.258
Mmm.

16:35.551 --> 16:38.262
I'm coming.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.098
What is it?

16:42.308 --> 16:44.309
Number 1, take the full pressure.

16:44.310 --> 16:46.603
All right, team.
Get me some power.

16:46.604 --> 16:48.605
- Oh, my God.
- The garage is lit up, too.

16:48.606 --> 16:51.108
- Deardra!
- Tom, they get out?

16:51.109 --> 16:54.152
Not Deardra and Nicholas.
Just Bill.

16:54.153 --> 16:57.030
- I need two men on that Engine 3 quarter, south side.
- On it.

16:57.031 --> 16:59.741
When we got here, there was
an empty gas can just sitting out front.

17:02.704 --> 17:06.205
David, Deardra and Nicholas
were upstairs locked inside a closet.

17:08.459 --> 17:10.335
Bill?

17:10.336 --> 17:12.796
What the hell happened here?

17:15.133 --> 17:16.633
- Oh, my God.
- Judy.

17:16.634 --> 17:17.675
Oh, God.

17:17.676 --> 17:19.469
- Judy, come on.
- No.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.762
- What the fuck have you done?
- Judy, come on.

17:21.763 --> 17:23.807
- Oh! Oh, David!
- Shh.

17:23.808 --> 17:26.351
Oh, God!

17:28.146 --> 17:29.479
Deardra!

17:32.400 --> 17:34.735
Deardra!

18:00.136 --> 18:02.304
What the hell?

18:06.726 --> 18:09.228
What the hell?

18:12.190 --> 18:13.816
What you got?

18:19.739 --> 18:21.156
Shit!

18:21.157 --> 18:23.284
Oh, my God.

18:24.285 --> 18:27.871
Russ, you get in touch
with Sheriff Byrnes in Cedar Rapids?

18:30.374 --> 18:32.375
- Russ?
- Uh, yeah.

18:32.376 --> 18:34.795
State troopers are coming this afternoon
to pick him up for transfer.

18:34.796 --> 18:36.630
How long has he been playing statue?

18:36.631 --> 18:39.091
A couple hours now.

18:40.259 --> 18:42.552
The same look Rory gave me.

18:42.553 --> 18:45.389
The same goddamn look.

18:51.020 --> 18:53.731
Shit.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.027
Sheriff's Department.

18:59.153 --> 19:02.406
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Slow down.

19:08.579 --> 19:11.122
Been there at least a week
by the looks of things.

19:11.123 --> 19:14.251
I'll check to see
if there's any identification.

19:14.252 --> 19:16.419
Yeah.

19:16.420 --> 19:18.881
Do that.

19:20.174 --> 19:23.885
Boys, last I checked,
hunting season ended three months ago.

19:23.886 --> 19:26.096
We was just out taking in a little nature.

19:26.097 --> 19:28.682
- Fresh air is all.
- Guns away till fall.

19:28.683 --> 19:31.059
- Aw, come on, Sheriff.
- What, are you kidding me?

19:31.060 --> 19:33.687
- What's with this guy?
- Well, we got us a pilot.

19:33.688 --> 19:36.147
Where's the plane?

19:36.148 --> 19:38.650
You know, last week,
Travis Quinn was going around

19:38.651 --> 19:41.444
saying he heard something crash
out by Hautman Bog.

19:41.445 --> 19:44.489
- I didn't think nothing of it.
- On account of him being full of shit?

19:44.490 --> 19:46.491
As a general rule.

19:46.492 --> 19:50.454
- Well, maybe there's the exception.
- Maybe.

19:57.461 --> 19:59.963
You said it sounded like a plane, Trav?

19:59.964 --> 20:01.631
Sheriff, about the reward...

20:01.632 --> 20:03.967
Shit. Big plane? Little plane?
What? Come on now.

20:03.968 --> 20:05.969
If you can explain the difference
how those two sound,

20:05.970 --> 20:08.221
- I might be able to figure it out.
- You're full of shit.

20:08.222 --> 20:09.973
He's full of shit.

20:09.974 --> 20:12.642
People only ask for a reward
when there's something to find.

20:12.643 --> 20:14.144
Is it gonna be a big reward, Sheriff?

20:14.145 --> 20:15.645
Travis, you ask about that again,

20:15.646 --> 20:17.480
I'm gonna throw you
out of the fucking boat.

20:17.481 --> 20:19.983
You're not gonna shoot me?

20:21.485 --> 20:22.819
Travis.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.821
Yeah?

20:24.822 --> 20:27.950
Kill the engine.

20:31.037 --> 20:33.663
It was a big plane, Russ.

20:33.664 --> 20:35.332
Why is that?

20:35.333 --> 20:38.085
'Cause we're right on top of it.

21:07.823 --> 21:10.867
Kevin, which way does
the water flow through town?

21:10.868 --> 21:12.661
Nice to see you, too, Dave.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.412
Waste water or drinking?

21:14.413 --> 21:17.166
- Drinking.
- Give me a second.

21:18.459 --> 21:20.460
A plane that size goes down...

21:20.461 --> 21:22.671
nothing in the paper,
nothing in the news.

21:22.672 --> 21:25.590
- Make any sense to you?
- It depends on what the payload is.

21:25.591 --> 21:27.550
Exactly what I'm thinking.

21:27.551 --> 21:29.803
Which is what?

21:29.804 --> 21:32.222
Hautman Bog...
What's that drain into?

21:32.223 --> 21:33.890
- Dwyer Creek.
- Which drains into?

21:33.891 --> 21:36.142
Black Pond. Oh, hey,
you remember monster catfish...

21:36.143 --> 21:39.479
Russell, where do you think
we get our drinking water from?

21:39.480 --> 21:42.691
Treated water comes in from the north,
breaks east-west.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.401
And what house does it get to first?

21:44.402 --> 21:47.070
Uh, let's see.

21:47.071 --> 21:49.490
Rory Hamill.

21:56.414 --> 22:00.625
You wanna shut off
the entire town's water supply on a hunch?

22:00.626 --> 22:04.254
Mayor, I've got three dead bodies
in the morgue in the last 48 hours.

22:04.255 --> 22:06.464
David, take a look around you.

22:06.465 --> 22:08.299
This is a farming community.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.301
It is springtime.
It is planting season.

22:10.302 --> 22:12.262
You turn off the water,
you're gonna kill the crops.

22:12.263 --> 22:15.932
You kill the crops, and you bankrupt
every family in Pierce County.

22:15.933 --> 22:19.060
And that is not based
on some, uh, hunch.

22:19.061 --> 22:21.063
That's a fact.

22:22.314 --> 22:25.400
Water stays on.

22:38.998 --> 22:40.290
Uh, Sheriff,

22:40.291 --> 22:41.958
I'm all for a little civil disobedience,

22:41.959 --> 22:46.129
but, um, I think this one
might cost you your job.

22:48.299 --> 22:50.801
You know what, Russ?

22:53.095 --> 22:56.098
That wouldn't be such a bad thing.

23:07.651 --> 23:10.320
What the fuck?

23:18.662 --> 23:21.832
Shh. Hang on a second.

23:25.002 --> 23:27.337
Well, is he dead?

23:29.465 --> 23:33.093
Well, if he is, he won't mind waiting.

23:36.472 --> 23:39.224
Oh! Jesus Christ!

23:41.477 --> 23:44.938
Did we or did we not request
a transfer for him this morning?

23:44.939 --> 23:46.440
Mm-hmm.

23:49.985 --> 23:52.195
God damn it.

23:56.867 --> 23:59.035
Even better.

24:01.705 --> 24:05.083
- You know what?
- What?

24:06.001 --> 24:08.503
We're in trouble.

24:40.327 --> 24:42.579
Hello?

25:36.717 --> 25:38.885
Jim?

25:52.316 --> 25:54.526
Jim?

26:42.449 --> 26:44.534
Jesus Christ.

26:54.962 --> 26:57.047
Behind you.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.918
Christ Almighty.

28:23.759 --> 28:25.760
David, I'm not gonna do this.

28:25.761 --> 28:27.470
I can't go to my parents.

28:27.471 --> 28:29.597
- You have no idea...
- And neither do you.

28:29.598 --> 28:32.475
Look, whatever it is,
I can't just leave.

28:32.476 --> 28:34.519
- Are you gonna leave?
- I'm the sheriff.

28:34.520 --> 28:35.978
- I'm their doctor.
- Yeah, well,

28:35.979 --> 28:37.814
if it turns out what they need is penicillin,

28:37.815 --> 28:39.982
I'll call you.

28:39.983 --> 28:41.150
David.

28:41.151 --> 28:43.153
What?

28:44.822 --> 28:46.323
What?

28:47.533 --> 28:50.493
There's somebody outside.

29:42.504 --> 29:44.380
David!

29:44.381 --> 29:46.424
David!

29:47.551 --> 29:49.385
Get on the ground!

29:49.386 --> 29:50.887
This is secure.

29:53.265 --> 29:55.933
All right! Let's go, men! Move it!

29:55.934 --> 29:57.935
Come on. Let's go.
Keep it moving.

30:00.397 --> 30:02.398
Sheriff, what's going on?

30:02.399 --> 30:04.650
- I don't know any more than you do.
- Keep moving, sir.

30:04.651 --> 30:05.860
Please take the first open seat.

30:05.861 --> 30:08.738
A funny thing happened
on the way to Cedar Rapids.

30:08.739 --> 30:11.199
Bastards spiked my tires.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.077
Who are these fuckers, man?

30:50.656 --> 30:52.949
Keep moving.
Everyone must exit the bus.

30:52.950 --> 30:54.283
Keep moving, please.

30:54.284 --> 30:56.202
Let's go, let's go!

30:56.203 --> 30:59.121
Stay in line, sir.
Keep up with the group, please.

30:59.122 --> 31:02.291
<i>Please head into the tent.</i>

31:02.292 --> 31:04.669
<i>- There is no need for alarm.
- Inside, please.</i>

31:04.670 --> 31:07.129
Forward, please.

31:07.130 --> 31:09.298
- Please keep moving into the tent.
- Please step forward.

31:09.299 --> 31:11.425
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.

31:11.426 --> 31:13.594
Hey, can one of you guys
tell me what's going on?

31:13.595 --> 31:16.806
- I'm sorry. You're gonna have to keep moving.
- Sir, come with me.

31:16.807 --> 31:17.932
No!

31:17.933 --> 31:19.475
- Russell!
- Don't touch me!

31:19.476 --> 31:21.561
- Coming through!
- The temperature spiked.

31:25.482 --> 31:27.984
- Ma'am...
- What are you people doing?

31:27.985 --> 31:29.735
Judy... Hey, don't touch me.

31:29.736 --> 31:31.696
- Hey!
- Both of you, out!

31:31.697 --> 31:34.240
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.

31:34.241 --> 31:36.701
- Go ahead. This way, please.
- Judy, what does it mean?

31:36.702 --> 31:38.911
- They're checking for elevated temperatures.
- Clear.

31:38.912 --> 31:41.163
Farnum was bleeding from the nose.
So was Rory.

31:41.164 --> 31:42.665
Well, cerebral hemorrhaging...

31:42.666 --> 31:44.500
It's gotta be some kind of virus.

31:44.501 --> 31:46.669
- You gotta wait here.
- Look, I'm a sheriff.

31:46.670 --> 31:48.504
- She's a doctor. We know these people.
- Clear.

31:48.505 --> 31:51.507
Would you just tell us what's going on?
Maybe we can actually help you.

31:54.011 --> 31:55.845
- Take her in there!
- David!

31:57.347 --> 31:58.556
Go, go, go!

31:58.557 --> 32:01.851
David!
Get off me! Stop!

32:01.852 --> 32:05.605
David! Wait! Wait!

32:05.606 --> 32:07.356
Stand back! Now!

32:07.357 --> 32:09.358
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Judy! Judy!

32:09.359 --> 32:11.027
Wait!

32:11.695 --> 32:14.071
David! David!

32:14.072 --> 32:16.032
Judy!

32:17.034 --> 32:21.621
David! David! David!

32:23.040 --> 32:24.415
Please.

32:24.416 --> 32:26.334
Please help me.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.628
Please. Please.

32:37.387 --> 32:40.556
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

32:40.557 --> 32:42.767
We got Trayberg scrubbed and ready.

32:42.768 --> 32:45.228
Let's go, let's go.

32:47.689 --> 32:49.690
Please. Please.

32:49.691 --> 32:52.402
Don't. Please. Don't.

32:53.820 --> 32:55.696
No.

32:55.697 --> 32:57.031
No.

32:57.032 --> 32:58.741
No. Please.

32:58.742 --> 33:01.327
Please. I'm pregnant.

33:01.328 --> 33:03.037
Please! No!

33:29.481 --> 33:30.606
Let's go!

33:30.607 --> 33:33.443
Franklin, open these doors!

33:34.111 --> 33:36.070
Quickly, people.
We're getting you outta here.

33:36.071 --> 33:37.947
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

33:37.948 --> 33:40.325
- Keep moving!
- Come on!

33:45.622 --> 33:47.289
Let's go, let's go.

33:47.290 --> 33:49.875
Extend your right arm,
please, sir. Let's go.

33:49.876 --> 33:52.461
You'll be given a card.
It looks like this.

33:52.462 --> 33:55.297
Do not lose it.

33:58.051 --> 34:00.595
Keep it moving.

34:10.856 --> 34:13.815
<i>We have an inbound vehicle
coming in from the northern perimeter.</i>

34:13.817 --> 34:16.527
<i>Do you have clearance ID? Over.</i>

34:18.905 --> 34:21.991
We have no ID.

34:28.165 --> 34:30.498
<i>We have gunfire!</i>

34:32.168 --> 34:35.755
<i>It's a civilian vehicle!</i>

34:37.674 --> 34:39.675
- Behind you!
- Right there! Right there!

34:57.527 --> 34:58.861
Keep moving.

34:58.862 --> 35:00.905
Kevin, where's Linda?

35:00.906 --> 35:03.699
- They took her. Judy?
- They took her, too.

35:03.700 --> 35:05.409
They took George and Francine

35:05.410 --> 35:06.869
and Winton Simon
and a whole mess of other people.

35:06.870 --> 35:09.580
- Jake!Jake!Jake!
- Mom!

35:09.581 --> 35:11.957
Let's go, people.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

35:11.958 --> 35:14.001
I'm going back.

35:14.002 --> 35:16.045
They got the whole town sealed off.

35:16.046 --> 35:18.005
Roadblocks on every highway.

35:18.006 --> 35:19.757
Tim Mitchell tried to run one.

35:19.758 --> 35:21.592
They shot him dead.
His entire family.

35:21.593 --> 35:23.093
Keep it moving.
Come up ahead.

35:23.094 --> 35:25.304
David, this here
might be your only chance.

35:25.305 --> 35:28.474
Don't lose it running off
on some fool's errand.

35:28.475 --> 35:31.060
Judy's a fool's errand?

35:31.061 --> 35:33.563
You know what I'm saying.

35:35.148 --> 35:37.107
I'll tell you what, Kev.

35:37.108 --> 35:39.193
Don't ask me why I can't leave
without my wife.

35:39.194 --> 35:41.321
I won't ask you why you can.

35:47.661 --> 35:50.996
We got a breach in the yard!
Got a breach in the yard!

35:50.997 --> 35:53.332
Move out! Move out!
Let's go! Evacuate!

35:53.333 --> 35:55.626
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

35:55.627 --> 35:57.753
The crazies have breached
the containment area!

35:57.754 --> 36:00.756
- The military's pulling out!
- We gotta get outta here!

36:04.261 --> 36:05.970
Come on! Go!
Get on board!

36:05.971 --> 36:07.930
- We're outta here!
- Move! Move! Move!

36:07.931 --> 36:11.308
Take 'em out!

36:11.309 --> 36:15.438
On board! On board!

36:55.145 --> 36:56.478
Nice to see you, too, Chief.

36:56.479 --> 36:59.315
Oh, shit.

37:08.033 --> 37:09.408
How'd you get out?

37:09.409 --> 37:10.701
Tom Ellis ran his pickup
through the fence.

37:10.702 --> 37:12.661
Fucking military started shooting.

37:12.662 --> 37:14.330
Townsfolk going nuts.

37:14.331 --> 37:17.333
Before you know it,
people are just running off into the fields.

37:17.334 --> 37:19.668
David, Judy was still inside.

37:19.669 --> 37:21.837
- I'm sorry.
- She's not sick.

37:21.838 --> 37:25.132
She's been running a fever all month.
Russ, she's pregnant.

37:25.133 --> 37:26.383
It's about time.

37:26.384 --> 37:28.427
I'm gonna go get her.

37:28.428 --> 37:31.681
Hoo-fucking-yah.
Let's go to the high school.

37:53.244 --> 37:56.372
Becca? Becca!

37:56.373 --> 37:58.791
Is that you?

37:59.459 --> 38:01.877
Oh, God. Honey...

38:01.878 --> 38:04.713
Honey, are you hurt?

38:04.714 --> 38:06.924
Is this really happening?

38:06.925 --> 38:10.636
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna be okay.

38:10.637 --> 38:13.931
You don't really believe that, do you?

38:30.949 --> 38:33.910
Shh.

40:29.067 --> 40:30.567
Oh. Shh. Shh.

40:30.568 --> 40:33.904
Please, Principal Sandborn, please stop.

40:33.905 --> 40:35.864
Please, let me go.

40:35.865 --> 40:38.659
Please don't do this.

40:38.660 --> 40:40.285
No. Please don't do this.

40:40.286 --> 40:43.622
Please. No, no. Please.

40:43.623 --> 40:46.375
No!

40:55.885 --> 40:57.762
Oh, shit.

41:04.435 --> 41:06.520
What are you doing? Stop!

41:06.521 --> 41:08.564
No. Please. Please.

41:08.565 --> 41:11.567
- No! N...
- Just get out of here, please.

41:11.568 --> 41:14.736
Stop. Please go. Don't.

41:14.737 --> 41:17.156
- Don't hurt her. Please, just go away.
- Please.

41:17.157 --> 41:18.574
Please.

41:18.575 --> 41:21.577
Please stop. Please stop.

41:21.578 --> 41:24.246
Stop. Leave her alone.

41:24.247 --> 41:25.956
Stop.

41:25.957 --> 41:28.959
Please just get out of here. Please.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.752
No.

41:30.753 --> 41:31.962
No.

41:33.506 --> 41:34.506
No!

41:35.842 --> 41:38.719
Oh! Oh!

41:38.720 --> 41:42.055
Oh, God! Oh, David!

41:42.056 --> 41:44.808
David! Oh, God!

41:44.809 --> 41:46.852
Are you okay?

41:46.853 --> 41:50.106
No, not really.

41:51.274 --> 41:55.110
- Uh, Chief?
- We gotta get to Quik Phil's truck stop on 35.

41:55.111 --> 41:58.739
They're putting people on buses,
and they're getting them out of here.

41:59.407 --> 42:02.993
We're gonna go. Come on.

42:04.454 --> 42:08.082
- Did Peter call?
- Shh.

42:09.292 --> 42:12.336
- Did Peter call?
- That's gonna be me.

42:12.337 --> 42:15.505
Russell, we've got enough problems
without you inventing them.

42:15.506 --> 42:17.299
- That's easy for you to say.
- Did Peter call?

42:17.300 --> 42:18.926
You're at the end of the pot mine.

42:18.927 --> 42:20.594
I'm a half mile from the farm.

42:20.595 --> 42:21.678
- Who's the sheriff?
- What?

42:21.679 --> 42:23.680
Who's the sheriff of Pierce County?

42:23.681 --> 42:25.933
- You are.
- I am. Who's the deputy?

42:25.934 --> 42:27.309
- That would be me.
- You are.

42:27.310 --> 42:28.810
Deputy does what the sheriff tells him.

42:28.811 --> 42:32.189
That's the balance of power.
And I'm telling you,

42:32.190 --> 42:35.526
you're not getting sick,
you understand me?

42:36.194 --> 42:38.904
Did Peter call?

42:40.365 --> 42:42.992
Did Peter call?

42:43.493 --> 42:45.452
I hope you're right, Chief.

42:45.453 --> 42:48.914
I'm not world leader, but I had plans.

42:48.915 --> 42:50.457
Did Peter call?

42:50.458 --> 42:52.543
Come on.

43:05.515 --> 43:08.184
Let's go.

43:35.586 --> 43:38.088
I'll check the truck.

43:39.674 --> 43:41.509
Fuck.

43:42.969 --> 43:46.388
Aw, shit!
It's booted.

43:49.392 --> 43:51.894
- They all are.
- I'll check those cars.

44:00.820 --> 44:04.198
It's not booted.

44:07.744 --> 44:10.120
Whoa, whoa.

44:10.621 --> 44:12.748
Russell,

44:12.749 --> 44:14.333
get out of the truck.

44:14.334 --> 44:16.835
Just give me a second.

44:16.836 --> 44:18.420
Oh, Jesus.

44:18.421 --> 44:21.256
Go. Run. Go on.

44:21.257 --> 44:23.300
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

44:23.301 --> 44:25.344
Get down, get down, get down.

44:30.308 --> 44:32.601
Come on, boys.

44:32.602 --> 44:34.770
Come on! Get him!

44:36.272 --> 44:38.648
Come on! Yeah!

44:38.649 --> 44:40.275
Whoo!

44:40.276 --> 44:42.152
Oh, yeah!

44:43.321 --> 44:45.280
- Whoo!
- Run, little man!

44:45.281 --> 44:47.074
Run!

44:47.075 --> 44:48.950
- Get him!
- Whoo!

44:51.120 --> 44:53.538
- Nice shot. Nice shot.
- Oh, yeah!

44:53.539 --> 44:55.290
Huh? Nice shot.

44:55.291 --> 44:57.876
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Nice shot, huh?

44:57.877 --> 45:00.129
Whoo!

45:03.216 --> 45:05.509
Come on. Get him.

45:05.510 --> 45:08.470
Hey, straight through the heart!

45:08.471 --> 45:10.847
- Uh-huh!
- Yeah!

45:10.848 --> 45:12.474
Shit.

45:12.475 --> 45:13.683
- Come on.
- Huh?

45:13.684 --> 45:15.685
Hey, he's gonna dress up real nice.

45:15.686 --> 45:19.315
Come on, boy.

45:21.234 --> 45:23.736
Come on.
Get him up on there.

45:37.959 --> 45:39.668
Good shot, man.

45:39.669 --> 45:42.671
I knew I was okay about that shot.

46:02.859 --> 46:06.111
It's a hell of a walk to Quik Phil's.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.281
I got the old cruiser on blocks.

46:09.282 --> 46:11.366
That piece of shit still works?

46:11.367 --> 46:12.868
Yeah.

46:12.869 --> 46:15.412
I guess you can't boot a car without wheels.

46:15.413 --> 46:17.372
It's seven miles to my place.

46:17.373 --> 46:19.207
It's five if we cut through
the McGregor farm.

46:19.208 --> 46:22.169
Another 20 to Quik Phil's from there.

46:22.712 --> 46:24.588
- I'm fine.
- Good.

46:24.589 --> 46:26.090
Let's go.

46:32.680 --> 46:35.224
They took my blood.

46:37.894 --> 46:41.563
Ran at least one test that I saw.

46:43.065 --> 46:45.901
What if the reason they didn't let me go
is because I have it?

46:45.902 --> 46:48.904
You're pregnant.
That's why you have a fever.

46:48.905 --> 46:52.574
David, you can't know that for sure.

46:52.575 --> 46:55.828
I can, and I do.

46:56.746 --> 46:59.873
If you're sick, I'm sick.
We drank from the same tap.

46:59.874 --> 47:03.377
And I'm not sick.
None of us are.

47:07.673 --> 47:10.092
We are gonna get through this.

47:16.432 --> 47:18.141
What the fuck?

47:18.142 --> 47:20.977
Scotty McGregor.
It's her boyfriend.

47:20.978 --> 47:22.270
Russell, stop her.

47:22.271 --> 47:23.271
- Yeah, I got it.
- David...

47:23.272 --> 47:25.565
We don't have time for this.

47:25.566 --> 47:28.110
You had time for me.

47:33.491 --> 47:35.951
Okay, let's go.

47:38.704 --> 47:41.456
It looks deserted.

47:41.457 --> 47:43.292
Scotty?

47:45.878 --> 47:47.379
- Scotty?
- Get back!

47:47.380 --> 47:50.048
- Drop the fucking gun, Scotty.
- I will blow your head off.

47:50.049 --> 47:52.467
- Scotty, it's me.
- Stay here.

47:52.468 --> 47:56.930
Scotty, don't be an asshole.
We're fine.

47:59.058 --> 48:00.475
Scotty.

48:00.476 --> 48:02.477
Scotty, put the gun down.

48:02.478 --> 48:03.979
Put it down.

48:03.980 --> 48:06.148
Scotty.

48:16.158 --> 48:17.826
Sorry.

48:19.495 --> 48:21.580
Had to be sure.

48:21.581 --> 48:26.210
Yeah, well, that's
a two-way street there, Scotty.

48:28.337 --> 48:31.506
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

48:31.507 --> 48:33.300
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

48:33.301 --> 48:35.385
- Scotty, where's your mom?
- Back at the house.

48:35.386 --> 48:37.429
We were just getting some supplies
before we started walking.

48:37.430 --> 48:40.015
The sheriff's got a car.
You two can come with us.

48:40.016 --> 48:42.767
- Are you okay?
- Better than you guys.

48:42.768 --> 48:45.645
- How's your mom?
- Be quiet.

48:45.646 --> 48:48.899
- Get in the barn.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

49:20.723 --> 49:22.724
Russ.

49:30.249 --> 49:33.193
- We have one civilian coming out.
- What are you doing?

49:33.194 --> 49:35.570
- Ma'am, please.
- Stop! Stop!

49:35.571 --> 49:36.946
We need you downstairs.

49:36.947 --> 49:38.698
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Wait.

49:38.699 --> 49:41.368
- We just need to process you.
- Oh, no.

49:41.369 --> 49:43.161
- Please!
- Okay, I got an adult male.

49:43.162 --> 49:45.038
I just need you...

49:45.039 --> 49:46.665
It'll just take a second, ma'am.

49:46.666 --> 49:48.458
Too late.

49:51.545 --> 49:53.421
Hold it right there!

49:58.469 --> 50:01.179
Scotty!

50:05.601 --> 50:07.978
Okay, light them up.

50:17.780 --> 50:20.115
Okay, let's go! Split it up!

50:20.116 --> 50:22.450
I want a complete sweep of the area!

50:22.451 --> 50:24.285
Take my gun.
Close the back of the barn.

50:24.286 --> 50:27.831
Move, move, move!

50:56.318 --> 50:58.403
Don't kill me, please.
Don't kill me.

50:58.404 --> 50:59.487
Oh, fuck.

50:59.488 --> 51:02.741
How could you do it?
How could you...

51:02.742 --> 51:04.743
- Becca...
- You make a sound louder than this,

51:04.744 --> 51:06.494
and I'll kill you, you understand?

51:06.495 --> 51:08.329
- What the hell was that?
- Orders, sir.

51:08.330 --> 51:10.165
- Who, asshole?
- Whoever gives them... I don't know.

51:10.166 --> 51:12.000
- Bullshit!
- What the fuck is going on here?

51:12.001 --> 51:14.419
All's they said is that there'd been
some sort of accident.

51:14.420 --> 51:17.172
My whole unit got flown in.
We didn't even know what state we was in

51:17.173 --> 51:20.425
till we seen the license plates.

51:25.181 --> 51:29.058
Am I gonna die without my mask on?

51:29.059 --> 51:31.269
Is that what they told you...

51:31.270 --> 51:33.271
If you took your mask off,
you were gonna die?

51:33.272 --> 51:36.942
They just said to keep it on.

51:37.443 --> 51:39.444
Look, um,

51:39.445 --> 51:42.197
I know I don't deserve
any favors from you people,

51:42.198 --> 51:45.283
but if you let me go,
I swear to God I won't say nothing.

51:45.284 --> 51:48.537
I didn't sign up
to shoot unarmed civilians.

51:49.455 --> 51:51.539
- I'll just leave, okay?
- Sit down.

51:51.540 --> 51:53.834
- Put the gun down, Russ.
- Chief...

51:55.628 --> 51:58.046
I'm a sheriff.
That's my deputy.

51:58.047 --> 52:00.840
Look, my wife's a doctor.
She's pregnant.

52:00.841 --> 52:03.259
- Becca here is not even 18.
- When he blabs, they'll find us.

52:03.260 --> 52:05.428
If we don't let him go,
they'll find us for sure.

52:05.429 --> 52:09.057
And besides,
he's not gonna blab.

52:09.809 --> 52:11.935
No, sir.

52:21.153 --> 52:23.238
You gotta give it to him, Russ.

52:23.239 --> 52:24.322
Shit.

52:24.323 --> 52:27.075
I'm sorry about your folks' town.

52:27.076 --> 52:29.536
- Hey, one up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

52:29.537 --> 52:31.913
Any crazies back there, Babcock?

52:34.583 --> 52:36.626
Babcock?

52:37.169 --> 52:38.920
No. We're all clear.

52:38.921 --> 52:41.297
Good. Military's pulling
back to the perimeter.

52:41.298 --> 52:43.759
Let's go. Come on.

52:45.511 --> 52:47.512
Barn's clear!

52:47.513 --> 52:49.764
- We're secure back there!
- All right, then.

52:49.765 --> 52:52.308
Mount up!
We're moving out!

53:11.370 --> 53:14.497
If what that soldier said is true,

53:14.498 --> 53:17.501
this disease has gone airborne.

53:20.129 --> 53:23.382
We just have to keep going.

54:21.857 --> 54:24.317
Uh, we'll go and get
the car up and running.

54:24.318 --> 54:27.028
- Come on.
- Go.

54:29.907 --> 54:32.533
Hey.

54:32.534 --> 54:34.327
Hey, hey, hey.

54:43.587 --> 54:46.089
It's perfect.

54:47.508 --> 54:50.760
It's a perfect, beautiful morning,

54:50.761 --> 54:52.762
and this is our home.

54:52.763 --> 54:54.764
This is where we were
gonna raise our baby.

54:54.765 --> 54:57.016
We can still do all those things.

54:57.017 --> 54:58.852
Hmm?

54:59.770 --> 55:02.355
Everyone we know...

55:02.356 --> 55:04.691
is dead.

55:06.777 --> 55:11.740
This town is dead,
and it's not coming back.

55:12.825 --> 55:15.744
It's never coming back.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.293
Fuck,yeah.

55:24.294 --> 55:26.587
See if you can find a toolbox.

55:26.588 --> 55:28.590
Okay.

56:00.831 --> 56:03.875
This was gonna be your room.

56:51.507 --> 56:53.883
Judy.

56:57.179 --> 56:58.513
Look, I know this is hard,

56:58.514 --> 57:01.808
but we've gotta keep moving.

57:32.923 --> 57:35.175
This is the gun that killed your father.

57:42.432 --> 57:44.976
Baby.

57:44.977 --> 57:47.812
Peggy... Peggy, no. Not Judy.

57:49.231 --> 57:50.898
No. No, no, no.

57:50.899 --> 57:53.067
I shot him.
I did. I shot him.

57:53.068 --> 57:54.735
Yes.

57:54.736 --> 57:56.571
Peggy, I shot him.

57:56.572 --> 57:58.614
Look at me, you crazy bitch!

57:58.615 --> 58:01.826
That's it.
I fucking shot him!

58:01.827 --> 58:03.744
I did it!

58:03.745 --> 58:06.164
He walked on that field
with a loaded shotgun!

58:06.165 --> 58:08.499
And I'm glad I did!

58:08.500 --> 58:10.376
They should give me a fucking medal!

58:10.377 --> 58:13.046
I finally killed the town drunk!

58:45.871 --> 58:47.038
Oh!

59:03.889 --> 59:06.015
- Oh, God.
- We're okay.

59:06.016 --> 59:08.601
- Baby!
- Oh, my God.

59:09.478 --> 59:11.479
Let me see your hand.

59:11.480 --> 59:14.274
Give me the Betadine.

59:17.069 --> 59:19.195
Yep, that's it. Here.

59:19.196 --> 59:20.780
Shit.

59:33.794 --> 59:36.671
Russell. Russell!

59:36.672 --> 59:39.090
Just making sure.

59:54.731 --> 59:57.233
He's sick, David.

59:58.694 --> 01:00:00.695
You don't know that.

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:01.946
- You saw what he did.
- Hey, guys.

01:00:01.947 --> 01:00:04.866
Come on. We gotta go.

01:00:07.327 --> 01:00:09.328
He saved our lives.

01:00:09.329 --> 01:00:11.831
That's what I saw.

01:00:58.754 --> 01:01:00.463
Hey, you feeling okay?

01:01:00.464 --> 01:01:02.882
- She's fine.
- Well, I'm just saying, if she's getting sick,

01:01:02.883 --> 01:01:05.551
- we don't wanna be in the fucking car with her.
- Russell, she's fine.

01:01:05.552 --> 01:01:07.094
I'm not sick.

01:01:07.095 --> 01:01:10.097
You wouldn't know,
'cause that'd be the sickness

01:01:10.098 --> 01:01:12.350
- messing with your mind.
- Okay. Russell, that's enough.

01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:15.102
Don't lose your head.

01:01:15.103 --> 01:01:17.605
What do you mean by that?

01:01:17.606 --> 01:01:19.690
I mean, don't lose your head.

01:01:19.691 --> 01:01:21.317
What do you mean by that, Chief?

01:01:21.318 --> 01:01:23.194
I mean...

01:01:23.195 --> 01:01:25.572
She's fine.

01:01:26.782 --> 01:01:28.616
Now, just...

01:01:31.328 --> 01:01:33.830
Fuck!

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:37.792
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.

01:01:37.793 --> 01:01:41.629
- David, honey...
- Aw, shit.

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:43.422
Guys, it's turning around.

01:01:43.423 --> 01:01:44.632
- It's coming back for us!
- Shit! Let's go!

01:01:44.633 --> 01:01:47.718
We gotta get out of here!

01:01:47.719 --> 01:01:51.014
- Go! Chief, let's go!
- The helicopter's coming!

01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:15.246
- We can't stay on the highway.
- No.

01:02:15.247 --> 01:02:16.914
There's gotta be another road we can take.

01:02:16.915 --> 01:02:19.542
- What road? Tell me?
- I don't know. There's gotta be something.

01:02:19.543 --> 01:02:21.502
- What road can they not see? Tell me.
- What?

01:02:21.503 --> 01:02:23.504
What road can they not see?

01:02:23.505 --> 01:02:25.172
What magic road can they not see?

01:02:25.173 --> 01:02:27.550
Tell me, and I'll fucking go.

01:02:27.551 --> 01:02:31.179
David, I'm just trying to help.

01:02:33.098 --> 01:02:35.891
I'm sorry.

01:02:37.519 --> 01:02:40.062
- I saw someone.
- Move. Where?

01:02:40.063 --> 01:02:43.023
He was back there.
I know I saw someone.

01:02:43.024 --> 01:02:45.025
Uh...

01:02:45.026 --> 01:02:48.863
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit.

01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:51.824
What the fuck?

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.994
David, get us outta here.

01:02:56.204 --> 01:02:59.582
Oh, shit.

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:02.209
Start the car.

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:03.377
Come on, Chief.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.714
Let's go. Come on.
Get us outta here.

01:03:10.886 --> 01:03:12.052
Let's go! Let's go!

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:15.723
Come on!

01:03:22.314 --> 01:03:23.981
Come on!

01:03:23.982 --> 01:03:25.733
- Let's go!
- All right!

01:03:25.734 --> 01:03:27.902
Come on!

01:03:27.903 --> 01:03:30.321
Come on! Let's go!

01:03:30.322 --> 01:03:32.406
- Why aren't we moving?
- Why the fuck aren't we moving, Chief?

01:03:32.407 --> 01:03:35.159
- 'Cause I can't get any fucking traction.
- Go! Go!

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.411
Fuck! Let's go!
Get us outta here! Come on!

01:03:39.581 --> 01:03:41.415
I don't wanna die like this!

01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:43.793
What the fuck was that?

01:03:46.755 --> 01:03:49.298
- There! There! Right there!
- Motherfucker!

01:03:49.299 --> 01:03:50.466
- Russell... Russ...
- There!

01:03:50.467 --> 01:03:51.467
Oh, shit!

01:03:51.468 --> 01:03:52.468
Motherfucker!

01:03:54.471 --> 01:03:55.888
Russell!

01:03:55.889 --> 01:03:58.390
- Oh, fuck!
- Russell!

01:03:58.391 --> 01:03:59.767
I saw movement!

01:03:59.768 --> 01:04:02.854
Everything is fucking moving!

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.562
Go! Come on! Come on!

01:04:54.739 --> 01:04:57.157
- Stop the fucking car!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:04:57.158 --> 01:04:59.076
Stop the car!

01:04:59.077 --> 01:05:01.162
- Stop!
- Judy!

01:05:02.163 --> 01:05:05.207
Shit! David!

01:05:05.208 --> 01:05:07.710
Help me here!
Help me!

01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:11.380
Oh, God, please.
You're okay.

01:05:11.381 --> 01:05:15.843
Becca! Becca! Becca!

01:05:24.019 --> 01:05:26.020
Oh, no.

01:05:31.443 --> 01:05:33.528
Becca.

01:05:38.908 --> 01:05:41.035
No.

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:43.704
Becca.

01:06:40.804 --> 01:06:42.930
That's my truck.

01:06:42.931 --> 01:06:45.766
Fuckers spiked my tires.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.655
Shit.

01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:12.334
God damn it!

01:07:12.335 --> 01:07:15.129
We need water.

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:16.630
I know.

01:07:16.631 --> 01:07:20.134
Guys, car coming!

01:07:29.477 --> 01:07:31.395
Stay here.

01:07:31.396 --> 01:07:33.355
David, what are you doing?

01:07:33.356 --> 01:07:36.108
We're taking this car.

01:07:49.414 --> 01:07:51.832
- Motherfucker!
- Russ!

01:07:51.833 --> 01:07:54.126
What are you... No!

01:07:54.711 --> 01:07:56.879
Whoo!

01:08:19.611 --> 01:08:23.363
Welcome to Pierce County,
friendliest place on earth, asshole.

01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:25.825
Russ, I wanna talk to him.

01:08:26.951 --> 01:08:28.911
Okay.

01:08:28.912 --> 01:08:31.205
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:08:31.206 --> 01:08:34.541
I'm the guy standing between you and a bullet.

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:37.502
Now, what was on that plane?

01:08:37.504 --> 01:08:40.506
What was on that goddamn plane?

01:08:40.506 --> 01:08:42.006
Trixie.

01:08:42.008 --> 01:08:44.426
Rhabdoveridae prototype.

01:08:44.426 --> 01:08:46.553
A... A fucking biological weapon.
- It was headed...

01:08:46.554 --> 01:08:49.389
- to an incinerator in Texas.
- Whoa. What is this?

01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:52.059
You're telling me that you guys
engineered this crap?

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.728
It's designed to destabilize a population.

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:56.897
In this case, the wrong one.

01:08:56.898 --> 01:08:58.524
Look, fella, we lost a plane.

01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:01.152
What do you want me to say?

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:06.240
How about, "Sorry for destroying
your whole goddamn town"?

01:09:06.241 --> 01:09:08.742
- What would you have preferred, a global pandemic?
- Wait. Wait.

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:11.537
Take it up with the pilot.
I came here to help.

01:09:11.537 --> 01:09:13.455
Help who? Help us?

01:09:13.456 --> 01:09:15.582
What... What is the incubation period?

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:17.584
48 hours.

01:09:17.585 --> 01:09:20.087
After that, you're either dead
or you don't have it.

01:09:20.087 --> 01:09:23.298
Fine. It's day three,
and we're still talking.

01:09:23.299 --> 01:09:25.133
So you are gonna help us.

01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:29.179
What the fuck!

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.848
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, my God!

01:09:30.849 --> 01:09:32.808
What the fuck is the matter with you?

01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:35.394
I said that I wanted to talk to him!

01:09:36.437 --> 01:09:38.229
You talked.

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.761
Shit.

01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:15.767
I'm gonna need that back.

01:10:15.768 --> 01:10:17.269
I'll carry it for a while.

01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:19.897
- You've been carrying it the whole time.
- Oh, no. Really.

01:10:19.898 --> 01:10:21.607
I got it.

01:10:21.608 --> 01:10:24.026
You sure?

01:10:24.027 --> 01:10:25.861
Yeah.

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.834
Russell, we're on your side.

01:10:40.835 --> 01:10:43.211
My side? Shit.
I didn't even know there were sides.

01:10:43.212 --> 01:10:45.339
- There's not. I'm just...
- Shut up the fuck up!

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.591
- Tell her to shut up, or I'll kill her, too.
- Russell, no!

01:10:47.592 --> 01:10:49.885
- Judy, stop talking.
- Okay.

01:10:49.886 --> 01:10:51.887
Let him think about what he's doing.

01:10:51.888 --> 01:10:54.181
Uh-huh.

01:10:55.767 --> 01:10:59.770
One, two,

01:10:59.771 --> 01:11:02.064
three.

01:11:03.816 --> 01:11:07.319
That's how many times
I've saved your life.

01:11:08.696 --> 01:11:10.072
Go on.

01:11:10.073 --> 01:11:12.074
Walk out where I can see you.

01:11:12.075 --> 01:11:13.576
Move!

01:11:38.768 --> 01:11:40.644
Fucking heavy.

01:11:46.609 --> 01:11:48.527
Move!

01:11:48.528 --> 01:11:50.529
Move!

01:11:59.747 --> 01:12:03.041
- Fuck it. I'm gonna confront him.
- No, David. Don't. Please.

01:12:03.042 --> 01:12:06.795
If we don't make it to that truck stop,
we're dead anyway.

01:12:06.796 --> 01:12:09.339
- Don't, David. Don't.
- Back off!

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.925
- I wanna talk to you.
- I will fucking shoot you where you stand.

01:12:11.926 --> 01:12:13.844
- I just wanna talk.
- David, stop.

01:12:13.845 --> 01:12:15.595
You better listen to me.

01:12:15.596 --> 01:12:17.097
- David.
- Put the gun down.

01:12:17.098 --> 01:12:19.891
- Final warning, Chief.
- Put it down.

01:12:19.892 --> 01:12:22.978
Please? Just put it down.

01:12:22.979 --> 01:12:25.439
I just wanna talk.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.109
You and me, man to man.

01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:31.278
Come on.

01:12:32.155 --> 01:12:34.072
- Shit.
- Okay.

01:12:34.073 --> 01:12:36.283
Here's the deal.

01:12:36.909 --> 01:12:39.453
Fuck!

01:12:52.008 --> 01:12:53.842
Hey.

01:12:54.969 --> 01:12:58.055
You remember that monster catfish
I caught last summer?

01:12:58.056 --> 01:13:00.516
What'd he weigh, you reckon?

01:13:02.518 --> 01:13:05.812
35, 40 pounds.

01:13:05.813 --> 01:13:07.481
Shit.

01:13:07.482 --> 01:13:10.985
It was a big son of a bitch.

01:13:22.121 --> 01:13:24.582
I'm not right, am I?

01:13:36.344 --> 01:13:38.512
Can I walk with you guys?

01:13:40.014 --> 01:13:43.142
Just a little while longer?

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.021
Please?

01:14:19.887 --> 01:14:22.222
Shit.

01:14:22.223 --> 01:14:25.725
If you cut through there,
you can make it to the highway on the other side.

01:14:25.726 --> 01:14:29.229
- They'll see us.
- Nah, they'll be focusing on me.

01:14:29.897 --> 01:14:32.899
Deputy does what
the sheriff tells him, right?

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.902
You're the sheriff.

01:14:35.903 --> 01:14:38.071
Come on, Chief.

01:14:38.072 --> 01:14:39.739
I'm done.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:42.200
I'm gonna die here no matter what.

01:14:42.201 --> 01:14:44.619
So let it mean something.

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.832
Let it mean that you two made it.
Give me that.

01:15:09.103 --> 01:15:11.522
Hoo-fucking-yah.

01:15:13.024 --> 01:15:15.317
<i>We got an inbound!</i>

01:15:15.318 --> 01:15:17.277
<i>- Hey!
- Attention!</i>

01:15:17.278 --> 01:15:20.447
<i>- You have entered a military operation.
- Hey! Hey!</i>

01:15:20.448 --> 01:15:22.407
<i>Please identify yourself.</i>

01:15:22.408 --> 01:15:24.117
My name's Deputy Russell Crank,

01:15:24.118 --> 01:15:26.119
the Pierce County Sheriff's Department.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.955
<i>- Keep your hands in the air and walk slowly.
- It's okay. I'm not sick.</i>

01:15:28.956 --> 01:15:30.373
<i>Make no sudden movements</i>

01:15:30.374 --> 01:15:32.125
<i>- or you will be fired upon.
- Oh, shit.</i>

01:15:32.126 --> 01:15:34.502
<i>We are a live-fire operation.</i>

01:15:34.503 --> 01:15:36.338
<i>Get out from behind the vehicle.</i>

01:15:36.339 --> 01:15:39.549
<i>You are in breach of
a Level 4 military operation.</i>

01:15:45.932 --> 01:15:49.768
<i>Reveal yourself,
or we will open fire.</i>

01:15:51.854 --> 01:15:54.814
<i>-Proceed slowly with your hands in the air.
- It's okay.</i>

01:15:54.815 --> 01:15:56.524
It's okay.

01:15:56.525 --> 01:15:59.319
<i>Now stop there
and get down on the ground.</i>

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.322
<i>Stop and get down on the ground!</i>

01:16:02.323 --> 01:16:04.741
<i>Get down on the ground now!</i>

01:16:08.246 --> 01:16:11.623
<i>- He's down!
- Man down! Cease fire!</i>

01:16:11.624 --> 01:16:13.792
<i>Fireteam Bravo, move up.</i>

01:16:13.793 --> 01:16:15.669
Alpha Team, stand by!

01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:18.005
Let's go, let's go!

01:16:20.167 --> 01:16:21.591
Approach with caution.

01:16:21.592 --> 01:16:24.010
Movement in tight.
He's still breathing!

01:16:24.011 --> 01:16:26.680
Secure that weapon!

01:16:26.681 --> 01:16:30.017
Stay on him.

01:16:31.269 --> 01:16:34.813
Fuck you for what you did.

01:16:46.409 --> 01:16:50.578
<i>Hey! Get an 18-Wheeler Dog</i>

01:16:50.579 --> 01:16:52.914
<i>only at Quik Phil's.</i>

01:16:52.915 --> 01:16:56.084
<i>Football fans,

01:16:56.085 --> 01:16:59.587
<i>with our University of Iowa
Hawkeyes Snack Pack.</i>

01:16:59.588 --> 01:17:02.757
<i>One jar of hot sauce and one jar of salsa</i>

01:17:02.758 --> 01:17:05.051
<i>in a collectible Iowa Hawkeyes helmet.</i>

01:17:05.052 --> 01:17:07.721
<i>Available while supplies last</i>

01:17:07.722 --> 01:17:10.890
<i>only at Quik Phil's.</i>

01:17:10.891 --> 01:17:13.226
It was Grand Central last night.

01:17:13.227 --> 01:17:17.522
<i>Nothing satisfies hunger
better than a Quik Phil's Mega-burger.</i>

01:17:17.523 --> 01:17:19.524
<i>Take it to go or eat it here</i>

01:17:19.525 --> 01:17:23.529
<i>- in one of our panoramic dining areas.
- Wait here.</i>

01:17:35.583 --> 01:17:38.001
Hello?

01:18:33.224 --> 01:18:35.517
Judy?

01:18:35.518 --> 01:18:39.980
Judy!Judy!

01:18:44.318 --> 01:18:47.446
Judy, you all right?

01:19:05.548 --> 01:19:08.175
Ohh.

01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:25.400
They exterminated everyone,
not just the sick.

01:19:25.401 --> 01:19:27.861
- Look, there's a rig we can take.
- What's the point?

01:19:27.862 --> 01:19:30.447
- If we get out of here, they're gonna kill us, too.
- No.

01:19:30.448 --> 01:19:32.824
- If we get to Cedar Rapids...
- David, can you just stop it?

01:19:32.825 --> 01:19:35.618
- If we get to Cedar Rapids...
- Can you stop pretending

01:19:35.619 --> 01:19:37.954
everything is gonna be okay?

01:19:37.955 --> 01:19:40.040
All right.

01:19:40.624 --> 01:19:42.918
For Christ sakes.

01:19:49.133 --> 01:19:51.885
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:01.687
You wanna give up?

01:20:03.105 --> 01:20:04.731
You wanna sit here and die?

01:20:04.732 --> 01:20:06.232
Tell me,

01:20:06.233 --> 01:20:10.237
and I will sit here and die with you.

01:20:35.054 --> 01:20:37.389
You gonna go get that truck?

01:21:45.541 --> 01:21:47.834
<i>Blackbird 2, this is T.O.C.</i>

01:21:47.835 --> 01:21:51.212
<i>We are approaching T minus ten minutes.
Confirm status.</i>

01:21:51.213 --> 01:21:54.341
<i>This is Blackbird 2...</i>

01:22:13.068 --> 01:22:15.069
<i>Be advised we are at ready status.</i>

01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:17.655
<i>Proceed to countdown.</i>

01:22:17.656 --> 01:22:19.907
<i>Countdown procedure initiated.</i>

01:22:19.908 --> 01:22:22.702
<i>We are at T minus ten minutes.</i>

01:22:22.703 --> 01:22:25.038
<i>All right. Blackbird 2 is in the air...</i>

01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:31.419
Truck!

01:23:53.711 --> 01:23:57.005
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:26:03.465 --> 01:26:04.674
Honey, it's fine.

01:26:04.675 --> 01:26:06.175
It's okay.

01:26:06.176 --> 01:26:08.595
Oh, shit.

01:26:13.267 --> 01:26:14.934
Oh, fuck.

01:26:20.524 --> 01:26:23.943
David, honey,
how's it going there?

01:26:23.944 --> 01:26:25.945
We're gonna get there.

01:26:25.946 --> 01:26:30.909
Oh, shit. Baby, come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:26:31.493 --> 01:26:32.577
David.

01:26:32.578 --> 01:26:35.913
God damn it!

01:26:35.914 --> 01:26:38.040
David, come on.

01:26:38.041 --> 01:26:40.084
- Hurry up.
- God damn it.

01:26:42.296 --> 01:26:44.422
I'm sorry. It's okay.

01:26:44.423 --> 01:26:46.799
They've gotta be in here somewhere,
David. Come on.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.051
- Just keep looking.
- Oh, fuck me. Just...

01:26:49.052 --> 01:26:51.763
Jesus, David.
What are you doing?

01:26:53.765 --> 01:26:55.558
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:26:57.311 --> 01:26:58.519
David!

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:02.023
David! Quick! Come on!

01:27:06.612 --> 01:27:09.322
David!

01:28:42.457 --> 01:28:45.418
Let's get the fuck out of here, huh?

01:29:05.105 --> 01:29:07.773
The smallest, straightest road
