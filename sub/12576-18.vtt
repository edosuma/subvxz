WEBVTT

00:34.242 --> 00:35.368
Good morning, class.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.328
I will be subbing for Mrs. Dorland

00:37.412 --> 00:40.206
who is at home recuperating
from the Hantavirus.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.959
What's the Hantavirus?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.128
Well, Clark, it's a flu-like disease

00:45.128 --> 00:47.380
usually contracted from rodent droppings.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.382
Okay, all right, then.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.177
Now, in preparation for our field trip,

00:52.177 --> 00:53.720
your classmates are going to act out

00:53.720 --> 00:56.473
a little-known episode
of Mexican-American history.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.392
The year is 1847.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.649
I am General Santa Anna.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.486
I led the Mexican army at the Alamo

01:09.486 --> 01:11.529
where we defeated Texas.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.367
We are at the battle of Cerro Gordo,

01:16.451 --> 01:19.079
11 years later, and we are hungry.

01:19.704 --> 01:22.373
Sir, I will hold your artificial leg

01:22.457 --> 01:24.042
while you eat chicken.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.216
Attack.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.759
Look out!

01:32.759 --> 01:35.512
It's the Illinois Volunteer Infantry.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.846
Hop on, General.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.893
I stole your fake leg.

01:44.729 --> 01:45.980
Oh, well, that was beautiful.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.232
That was just inspired.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.068
The General's artificial leg
has been on display

01:50.068 --> 01:52.153
in an Illinois Museum for over a century,

01:52.237 --> 01:56.533
but this year, America decided
to return it to Mexico.

01:56.533 --> 02:00.829
Even as we speak, Santa Anna's
real fake leg is making its way

02:00.829 --> 02:03.915
from museum to museum on its journey home.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.708
I guess you could say

02:05.792 --> 02:08.837
the Arlen Museum is
the last leg of the tour.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.298
Oh, Peggy.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.803
Yeah, see, that was 1976.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.806
In 1977, I did wear shoes.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.227
Boy, that car is going fast.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
Doesn't he know men drink in this alley?

02:26.229 --> 02:29.232
Well, that looks like
your dad's Cadillac car, Hank.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.610
Yeah, man. It looks like dang ol'...
Better hit the dirt, man!

02:35.196 --> 02:36.239
- Uh...

02:37.532 --> 02:38.449
Thanks, fatty.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.617
Don't mind if I do.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.579
Geez, Dad. You almost dented the cooler.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.789
Where's Didi?
I thought, with your eyesight,

02:44.873 --> 02:46.249
she was doing all the driving.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.168
Ah, we had another fight.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.127
I threw her out.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.505
Didi, woman, my toes are cold.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.007
Knit me a blanket!

02:54.007 --> 02:55.550
I don't have time, honey.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.718
I'm late for work.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.890
That's a good one, babycakes!

03:02.390 --> 03:03.933
Now, get your knitting sticks.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.269
You're going to have
to wear socks, Colonel.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.939
Yeah, so I put her out on the street.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.399
Good for you, sir.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.525
I admire the speed

03:12.609 --> 03:14.903
with which you dispatched
the insubordinate.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.321
Shut your clam hole, Gribble.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.656
So, I guess you're here

03:18.740 --> 03:20.325
to cool off for a few days

03:20.325 --> 03:22.076
till you two can patch things up?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.494
Nope! This one's for good.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.788
I'm here to renew my driver's license.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.625
Got the eye chart memorized
down at the Arlen D.M.V.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.752
They ain't changed it since World War II.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.171
Uh, that's the big one, fatty.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.965
Uh, Dad, about you driving.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.343
I'm not sure it's such a good idea.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.011
Excuse me, Hank.

03:40.011 --> 03:43.431
I think a man who gave his shins
to win the Second World War

03:43.431 --> 03:45.892
has earned the right
to drive an automobile.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.397
Hank, Bobby and me

03:51.481 --> 03:54.108
are going to rent an R.V this summer
and drive around the country.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.736
We'll do 50 states in 50 days.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.240
You know, Cotton, you can travel
anywhere in the world in books.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.200
- Uh, Dad...

04:02.200 --> 04:05.411
You don't want to be driving
on a crowded highway in the summertime.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.247
I don't know.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.582
There's nothing like
the feel of the open road.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.668
Oh, you know, Grandpa Hill,

04:11.668 --> 04:14.128
with an R.V, you could
put it on cruise control

04:14.212 --> 04:16.422
and then go in the back and watch TV.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.342
Luanne, please.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.511
Dad, with all due respect,

04:22.053 --> 04:24.389
I don't think
you should be driving anymore.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.517
Don't you tell me what to do!

04:28.017 --> 04:29.852
You ain't my daddy! I'm your daddy!

04:30.603 --> 04:32.188
- I won the war!

04:32.272 --> 04:33.606
I can drive a car!

04:33.982 --> 04:35.984
Even your idiot friend Gribble knows that!

04:35.984 --> 04:38.444
Ah, Dad, Dale's just kissing up to you.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.946
- And so should you, boy!

04:41.072 --> 04:42.991
Uh, Hank, that reminds me.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.451
We need some chaperones
for Bobby's class trip.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.829
What kind of trip you
taking, Bobby? Vegas?

04:47.829 --> 04:50.707
There's a General Santa Anna
exhibit at the museum.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.583
We did a play about him in school,

04:52.667 --> 04:54.627
and I was one of his privates.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.005
Yeah, yeah, I know all about Santy Anny.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.717
We got his walking log under glass
in Illinois I'm glad to say.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.219
Actually, Cotton,
the leg is coming through Arlen.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.596
America is finally
returning the leg to Mexico.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.974
- What?
- Take it easy, Dad.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.894
- Take it easy.
- You see, Bobby?

05:11.978 --> 05:15.189
Your daddy's generation's
giving away everything we fought for.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.026
Pan-y-ma canal, Mexican legs...

05:18.026 --> 05:21.195
You people'd give back
Gandhi's diapers if you had 'em!

05:30.872 --> 05:32.665
Ah! Would you look at that line?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.000
We'll be here all day.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.126
Oh, for god...

05:35.626 --> 05:36.836
Hank, I gutted a man.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.379
He whined less than you.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.132
Why don't you guys get started?
I'll be there in a minute.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.353
All right, clerkie.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.022
Now, take down the first letter
of every word I say.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.732
Some day

05:58.274 --> 05:59.525
Governor Reagan,

06:00.276 --> 06:02.070
will run for president.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.529
I pass. Give me the license.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.324
Wow, I've never seen anyone
miss every single letter.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.284
- You fail.
- What?

06:08.576 --> 06:09.577
Look at it again.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.704
"Some day." That's S-D,

06:11.788 --> 06:13.247
as in "Stupid Dummy."

06:13.331 --> 06:14.791
That's you. Tell him, Hank.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.626
This is an outrage.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.003
We are very dissatisfied customers.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.171
Come on, Dad, let's go.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.760
So, you had the clerk
switch the eye chart.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.931
That's a good plan,
if you silence the clerk.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.724
It was one of the toughest things

06:31.808 --> 06:33.643
I ever had to do, I'll tell you what,

06:33.643 --> 06:36.396
but my dad's getting close
to the end zone now.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.731
I got to start calling some of his plays.

06:38.815 --> 06:39.982
Yeah, I know what you mean.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.944
My dad can't even load
his own hunting rifle anymore.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.862
I mean, I got to put it in his hands,

06:44.946 --> 06:47.198
practically pull the dang trigger for him.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.283
Sad. Very sad.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.870
The DMV changed the damn chart on me.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.038
That's what they did!

06:54.122 --> 06:56.124
Tell you what, man.
That dang ol' DMV, man,

06:56.124 --> 06:58.626
take my picture that ol' hair hooter
that day, man.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.921
Four dang ol' years ago,
looking like Cokie Roberts, man.

07:01.921 --> 07:05.216
There are ways to get around
the license problem, sir.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.510
Dale, this doesn't concern you.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.304
For example, put a sail on your car.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.140
Call it a boat.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.017
Hear that, Hank?
Gribble's got a clever idea.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.227
Go get me a sail!

07:16.227 --> 07:18.104
It's a stupid idea, Dad.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.939
Well, excuse me, Hank.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.400
I guess I'm not as clever as you are.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.569
I mean, I could never think
of a clever idea

07:24.569 --> 07:26.195
like switching the eye charts

07:26.279 --> 07:28.614
so your dad would fail that test.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.658
- Dang it, Dale!
- Ah!

07:30.658 --> 07:33.202
Looks like we got ourselves
a Benedict Arlen!

07:33.286 --> 07:35.580
What do you got to say for yourself, boy?

07:35.580 --> 07:38.583
Look, Dad, I did change that chart.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.251
I did it because I care about you.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.128
You should not be driving!

07:42.128 --> 07:44.255
But he's a war hero, Hank.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.090
A World war hero.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.259
You should let him do whatever he wants.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.552
Shut up, Dale!

07:49.552 --> 07:51.596
I know what's best for my dad.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.181
If you knew what's best for me,

07:53.181 --> 07:56.017
you'd have drowned yourself
two days after you was born!

07:56.434 --> 07:58.102
Goodbye, Hank. I'm leaving.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.989
Gribble! Good news!

08:09.989 --> 08:12.575
I'm staying with you from now on!

08:12.575 --> 08:13.659
You hear that, Hank?

08:14.285 --> 08:16.245
Daddy's staying with me.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.007
Did you sleep okay, Mr. Hill?

08:28.007 --> 08:30.301
Yup. Yup. Just fine.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.594
See, Nancy?

08:31.594 --> 08:34.388
And you wanted to give away Joseph's crib.

08:37.934 --> 08:38.935
There you go, sir.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.479
One perfectly forged driver's license.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.689
Good until the year 3000.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.483
Good boy. Here's a dollar.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.651
Hmm.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.237
Oh, hey, Dad, I need you to sign

08:49.237 --> 08:51.739
my permission slip
for that Santa Anna exhibit.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.325
Joseph, you know I do not sign

08:54.325 --> 08:57.411
any document issued
by a government institution.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.790
- Hey, Hank.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.416
Come on, Joseph. Our ride's here.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.797
Hey, Tokyo Rose,
how does your garden grow?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.632
Don't start with me, Dale.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.051
All right, Dad, you made your point.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.512
Now, come on back,
and we'll talk about this.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.390
I got a whole box
of Megalo-plates you can break.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.725
I'd rather break Gribble's plates,
thank you very much.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.062
No. Thank you very much, sir.

09:23.688 --> 09:27.400
Now I'm done. I'm going down to
the drugstore to pick up my shin salve.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.610
All right, well, let me drive you, and...

09:29.694 --> 09:31.946
I don't need you.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.489
Gribble made me a license.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.912
I've never seen a meter maid
take so long to write a ticket.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.790
All right, sir, please
step out of the vehicle.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.210
Whoo-hoo!

09:46.294 --> 09:48.045
You want to frisk me, Cagney?

09:48.129 --> 09:49.922
Go ahead. Then I can do you.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.094
And when I asked for his license,
he gave me this.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.054
Yeah, I know. It's expired.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.890
I'm real sorry about that.
He shouldn't be driving.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.018
Expired? It's not even real.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.353
It's made out of the back of a cereal box.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.063
Well, you're lucky.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.649
In the most severe cases
of senile dementia,

10:08.858 --> 10:10.735
they can't even remember
their sons' names.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.361
What? He's not senile.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.988
My dad's just a character.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.615
You know, like a cowboy.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.827
Dad, knock it off. Come on.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.997
All right, General Mills.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.459
Now, I'm letting your son
take care of you.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.378
You have to promise to be a good boy.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.048
Do you recognize your son?

10:32.715 --> 10:34.550
Yeah. He's Benedict Arlen.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.680
The point is, Dad,
you've got to calm down.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.432
You're lucky you're not in jail.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.476
Don't you take that tone with me.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.770
I was out buying shin jelly.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.063
You show some respect.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.524
Oh, okay, okay, let's talk
about it over dinner. What do you say?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.985
Go get your bags, and we'll head on home.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.070
Oh, sure.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.696
I'll be right there.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.440
- Uh, hey, Didi.
- Hank.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.235
Listen, I'm here to ask you
for a big favor.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.153
You and my dad got to patch things up

11:36.237 --> 11:37.655
quicker than usual this time.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.032
I'm having trouble
keeping him under control.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.535
Oh, there's no patching things up
this time, Hank.

11:42.993 --> 11:43.994
The passion is gone.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.289
<i>There was magic between us
when we first met.</i>

11:47.998 --> 11:50.626
Yeah, I come in here once a year

11:50.710 --> 11:52.253
to get my shins drained.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.088
I don't take no anesthetic.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.425
Did Lincoln ask for girlie-gas
when they blowed his head off?

11:57.425 --> 11:58.384
Magazines?

11:59.176 --> 12:01.303
Candy? Fruit roll-ups?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.514
Oh, look at you.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.142
Aren't you the cutest
little helpless thing?

12:07.059 --> 12:09.311
Oh, you're like
a little baby in that gown.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.648
Oh, coochie, coochie, coo...

12:12.732 --> 12:14.150
- Oops.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.486
Oh! Sweet lord!

12:18.070 --> 12:19.989
Cling peaches in heavy syrup!

12:20.448 --> 12:23.242
<i>It was like Romeo and, um...</i>

12:23.993 --> 12:24.910
<i>Juliet.</i>

12:25.828 --> 12:27.580
But now the magic's gone.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.249
Cotton said my bottom was too small.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.710
Do you think it's too small?

12:32.710 --> 12:34.295
Ah! No!

12:34.295 --> 12:36.338
Put that away. It... it's fine.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.757
It's very, uh, big.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.885
Look, Hank, Isotoner makes sundresses now.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.388
Uh-oh.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.515
She is not going to take him back, is she?

12:46.599 --> 12:50.144
Nope. I'm going to have
to watch him like a hawk.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.607
Uh... Cigar, Hank?

12:54.607 --> 12:55.566
No, thanks.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.151
Good, 'cause they all been smoked.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.157
Yeah, you got me on that one.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.660
Anyway, the reason I'm here
is to ask you to be a chaperone

13:06.744 --> 13:08.871
on Bobby's museum trip tomorrow.

13:08.871 --> 13:09.914
I'm gonna be one.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.542
Daddy can't go.
He's taking me bumper bowling.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.045
Will you stop calling him daddy?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.714
Come on, Dad,
you'd really be helping us out.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.967
Well, I've been helping you
out of jams your whole life.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.720
Might as well keep the streak alive.
I'll do it.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.557
We'll do it.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.145
And then, you killed the German Corporal?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.940
This is World War II, Connie girl.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.149
He was a "Nazzy."

13:37.233 --> 13:38.818
Yeah, I severed his windpipe

13:38.818 --> 13:42.029
with a two-foot strand of dental floss
I kept in my boot.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.781
And that's why it's always important...

13:44.406 --> 13:45.282
to carry dental floss.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.748
Okay, Tom Landry Middle School,

13:52.832 --> 13:55.000
next stop is the featured exhibit.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.670
General Santy Anny's artificial leg.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.881
Oh, what a beautiful prosthetic.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.092
Those T-shirts do not do it justice.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.219
After its brief stay here,

14:05.219 --> 14:06.595
General Santy Anny's leg

14:06.679 --> 14:09.515
will be returned
to its rightful owner, Mexico.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.684
Rightful? Finders keepers.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.186
Dad, now, take it easy. Relax.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.146
Along with the leg,

14:16.230 --> 14:17.940
Mexico will receive a check

14:17.940 --> 14:22.152
for the original cost
of the leg, 1,300 dollars U.S

14:22.236 --> 14:25.948
and a letter of apology
signed by our commander in chief.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.491
Ah, that draft dodger.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.661
He can't do that.
The Japanese blew my shins off.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.079
When am I going to get them back?

14:32.079 --> 14:33.747
Hank, chaperone.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.040
Chaperone your father.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.043
Dad, I'm not going to tell you again.
Zip it.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.469
Let's settle, people. Okay.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.471
All right, stop the bus!

14:49.930 --> 14:51.348
It's been stolen.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.351
One of these hoodlums
stole Santy Anny's leg.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.562
All right, kids, listen up.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.272
I'm going to close my eyes,

14:58.272 --> 15:00.316
and when I open them,
I want to see that leg.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.525
You understand?

15:24.173 --> 15:25.925
All right, Dad, I'm fed up.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.217
Now, where is the leg?

15:27.301 --> 15:30.679
Well, I don't know if I can speak to that.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.431
I was told to zip it.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.350
The whole country of Mexico

15:34.350 --> 15:37.102
is expecting to get their leg back
on Saturday.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.771
Delightful!

15:38.771 --> 15:40.189
That leg means a lot to them,

15:40.439 --> 15:42.691
and my driver's license means a lot to me.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.945
What does the leg have to do
with your driver's license?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.905
Use your head, boy.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.448
The Mexicans have diplomats.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.576
They'll pull some strings,
get me my license,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.370
then I'll give them back their leg.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.373
Dad, the police
are going to come after you.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.209
That's my offer.
Take it back to your people.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.884
They never look in the most obvious place.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.805
Colonel, shall we retire to the leg room?

16:20.187 --> 16:22.314
Maybe that policewoman was right.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.608
I've never seen dad like this before.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.111
He's not his crazy, old self anymore.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.780
He's acting... crazy.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.116
Well, stick a pin in me, I'm dreaming.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.326
I have been saying that
to you for 22 years.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.621
Aunt Peg, Uncle Hank,
I just heard on the news,

16:37.705 --> 16:39.915
there's a Santa Claus exhibit
at the museum,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.917
and someone stole his leg!

16:42.334 --> 16:43.669
Oh!

16:45.504 --> 16:47.214
Colonel, I just want to say

16:47.214 --> 16:48.882
it's been an honor fighting with you

16:48.966 --> 16:50.509
against Hank and his forces.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.178
You can rest assured
I am with you all the way.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.889
You got any of them
little goldfish crackers?

16:59.268 --> 17:01.437
Uh, he did it!

17:01.437 --> 17:02.813
He took the leg.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.856
It was his idea.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.482
You can have it back.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.860
Oh, no! It's gone!

17:07.985 --> 17:10.487
Where'd you put it, you shinless,
old freak?

17:10.571 --> 17:13.365
What did you...
You're a worse traitor than Hank.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.200
I know how to deal with traitors.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.621
Sir, you're going to want
to give me that leg right now

17:19.705 --> 17:21.665
before you get in any more trouble.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.168
I need that leg for leverage

17:24.168 --> 17:26.795
in my negotiations
with the Mexican government!

17:26.879 --> 17:29.548
They took my shins and put them on display

17:29.548 --> 17:31.008
in the emperor's pagoda.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.218
That's the thanks I get
for flossing them nazis.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.637
You tell the meter maid
I want my car back.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.639
I can drive myself.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.141
They just changed the chart.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.561
Someday, Governor Reagan
will run for president!

17:47.441 --> 17:50.194
And we felt the psychological
evaluation had come to an end

17:50.194 --> 17:53.489
after he claimed Dr. Miyoshi's
stethoscope as a war trophy.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.449
Well, what're you going to do?

17:55.449 --> 17:56.992
Just keep him here forever?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.660
Well, that's up to you.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.746
It's my opinion that
he requires supervision.

18:00.746 --> 18:05.042
Either he stays here, or you and your wife
need to watch him 24 hours a day.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.714
Hey, Dad, how do you like it here?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.593
Find someplace else to stand, fatty!

18:14.593 --> 18:16.637
Oh, see? You know his name.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.806
He's already made a friend.
See? He knows his name.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.016
Look, Peggy, board games.

18:21.100 --> 18:21.934
Oh!

18:21.934 --> 18:23.102
- Checkers...
- I love checkers.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.895
...dominoes, chutes and ladders.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.271
Chutes and ladders.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.315
Why, if I didn't have to work every day,

18:28.315 --> 18:29.358
I'd come here.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.196
Uh... Dad, I know a lot has happened

18:34.196 --> 18:35.614
in the last day or so,

18:35.614 --> 18:38.200
but I need to know where that leg is.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.204
If I give the leg back,
can I get out of here?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.125
We'll see. It's not up to me.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.294
All right. It's in Gribble's golf bag.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.214
I drew a one on it
and signed it Lee Trevino.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.466
All right, then. Dale's golf bag.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.343
Take it easy, Dad.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.264
Uh... don't forget about your old man.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.307
You'll come back for me, right, boy?

19:06.645 --> 19:09.857
Well, it's not so bad in there... really.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.901
Ah, Peggy, come on. That was awful.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.486
My father hates it in there.

19:15.863 --> 19:19.408
But it's not like
I can watch him 24 hours a day.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.285
Oh, no, you cannot.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.454
Just wouldn't be fair
to you or me or Bobby.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.040
Maybe we're being
too picky about this V.A.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.126
You know, consumer reports
gave it a B-minus.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.545
Well, that's above average.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.882
Hank... How you going to break it to him?

20:00.949 --> 20:02.784
So? Uh...

20:03.619 --> 20:06.163
am I going to live with you
and Hank's wife?

20:06.163 --> 20:07.873
No.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.499
But I told you where the leg was!

20:09.583 --> 20:11.752
I know, and I gave it to the police.

20:11.752 --> 20:15.214
Look, Dad, I can't take care
of you all day long,

20:15.214 --> 20:17.299
and you wouldn't really want it that way,

20:17.299 --> 20:19.885
so there's only one other option.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.513
Didi! What's she doing here?

20:23.597 --> 20:25.307
I told you it was over, woman.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.934
I told him the same thing,

20:26.934 --> 20:28.477
but he said I have to sign something

20:28.477 --> 20:30.187
to get the Cadillac car.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.191
<i>-♪ Don't sit under the apple tree♪</i>
- Aah.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.194
<i>♪ With anyone else but me,
anyone else but me ♪</i>

20:37.194 --> 20:40.030
They've got you in a baby gown.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.074
Oh, look at the baby.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.496
Ah! Stop!

20:48.830 --> 20:51.250
- Huh? I'll get those.

20:53.752 --> 20:57.673
Oh, honey. I'm sorry I said
your butt was too small.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.800
If anything, it's too big.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.470
But I likes you for who you is.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.597
Come on, little baby boy.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.391
I'll drive you home.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.778
That is retired Captain Barissimo de Fino.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.947
When he straps on Santa Anna's leg

21:21.947 --> 21:23.907
and walks it from our flag to his,

21:24.074 --> 21:26.743
it will be officially returned
to the Mexican peoples.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.542
Well, the important thing
is they got it back.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.794
Hey, wait a minute.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.547
- That's the leg I made for the play.
- Oh.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.135
Here you are, <i>senor,</i> one driver's license.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.636
Thank you.

21:45.262 --> 21:48.265
And here you are, one Santy Anny's leg.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.193
<i>The story you've just seen
is based on a true event.</i>

22:00.277 --> 22:03.030
<i>At the battle of Cerro Gordo in 1847,</i>

22:03.196 --> 22:06.325
<i>the Illinois Volunteer Infantry
captured the artificial leg</i>

22:06.325 --> 22:09.453
<i>of Mexican General
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna</i>

22:09.453 --> 22:13.290
<i>while the general and his men
feasted on a lunch of roasted chicken.</i>

22:13.290 --> 22:15.125
<i>Unfortunately, Santa Anna's leg</i>

22:15.125 --> 22:17.711
<i>still resides in an Illinois museum.</i>

22:17.711 --> 22:19.379
<i>If you would like to join the movement</i>

22:19.463 --> 22:21.631
<i>to help return the leg
to the Mexican people,</i>

22:22.132 --> 22:24.509
<i>write Illinois senator Richard J. Durbin.</i>

22:25.093 --> 22:26.928
<i>Thank you, and good night.</i>

22:27.012 --> 22:29.598
<i>That's a good one, babycakes.</i>
