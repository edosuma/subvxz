00:36.269 --> 00:39.172
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN CAUSE AND EFFECT ?

00:39.239 --> 00:40.907
DROP A GLASS,
THE GLASS BREAKS,

00:40.974 --> 00:44.010
STRIKE A MATCH
AND A FIRE STARTS.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.311
DO THE THINGS
WE DO IN THIS LIFE

00:45.378 --> 00:47.547
SCREW YOU IN
THE ONE THAT COMES AFTER ?

00:47.614 --> 00:49.349
I THINK SO.

00:49.416 --> 00:51.618
SPAWN'S LEARNING
THAT LITTLE LESSON TOO.

00:51.684 --> 00:53.686
OH, HE'D LIKE TO MAKE IT
ALL GO AWAY SOMEHOW,

00:53.753 --> 00:55.989
PULL OUT, HIDE,
SLEEP IT OFF,

00:56.055 --> 00:58.091
BUT HE MADE HIS DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL,

00:58.158 --> 01:00.827
AND NOW THE DOMINOES
ARE ALREADY CRASHING DOWN.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.663
AND HE'S GOT NOBODY
TO BLAME BUT HIMSELF.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.432
AND ME.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.368
I'M TODD McFARLANE,
AND I CREATED SPAWN.

01:15.341 --> 01:18.745
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT THE GUY
WHO TOOK OUT TONY'S MEN !

01:24.384 --> 01:26.553
OVERKILL,
SON-OF-A-BITCH !

01:26.619 --> 01:27.987
THAT HE WAS.

01:28.054 --> 01:29.489
( reporter )
Asked to possibly re-open

01:29.556 --> 01:31.458
the Kyle Watson
child-killer case,

01:31.524 --> 01:34.494
in light of what was termed a
blatant oversight by the police,

01:34.561 --> 01:36.296
defense attorney
Wanda Blake

01:36.362 --> 01:38.298
is responsible for
this latest revelation.

01:38.364 --> 01:41.668
I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN',
I BEEN A GOOD BOY.

01:41.734 --> 01:44.471
( male )
YOU HAVE ENTERED A
RESTRICTED STORAGE FACILITY.

01:44.537 --> 01:47.941
COME OUT WITH HANDS HIGH
OR WE WILL OPEN FIRE.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.943
FIRE !

01:53.680 --> 01:56.182
WHEN ARE YOU
COMIN' TO BED ?

01:56.249 --> 01:57.884
I LOVE YOU WANDA.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.620
( radio )
Looks like police are gonna
cut child-killer Kyle Watson

02:00.687 --> 02:02.088
loose after all.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.923
Thanks to his attorney
Wanda Blake,

02:03.990 --> 02:05.492
independent investigators
have found that

02:05.558 --> 02:08.228
evidence in the case may
actually have been planted.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.601
AND NOW SPAWN,
SO TURN OFF YOUR LIGHTS.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.910
AHHH !

03:12.425 --> 03:15.395
HE WAITS,
AS THEY ALL DO,

03:15.461 --> 03:18.464
FOR A SIGN,
A WARNING,

03:18.531 --> 03:21.367
SOMETHING TO SET
EVENTS IN MOTION.

03:21.434 --> 03:23.303
FEW WARRIORS REALIZE

03:23.369 --> 03:25.605
THAT THE BATTLE
BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL

03:25.672 --> 03:30.476
IS CONSTANT, ON-GOING,
INCIDENT AFTER INCIDENT.

03:30.543 --> 03:34.247
PART OF AN
UNENDING CHAIN.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.849
"THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE",

03:36.916 --> 03:39.385
THAT'S WHAT
SCIENTISTS CALL IT.

03:39.452 --> 03:42.322
ONE THING HAPPENS
THAT TRIGGERS ANOTHER

03:42.388 --> 03:44.490
AND ANOTHER
AND ANOTHER.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.826
AND IN THE END,

03:46.893 --> 03:48.962
ALL WILL
BE REVEALED,

03:49.028 --> 03:52.966
NO MATTER HOW WONDERFUL
OR HIDEOUS THE RESULT.

04:18.458 --> 04:22.262
MR. TWIST, I JUST WANT TO SAY
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, OKAY ?

04:22.328 --> 04:24.564
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU NEED, YOU GOT.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.933
RIGHT NOW I NEED YOU
TO SHUT UP AND LISTEN.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.102
THIS IS IMPORTANT OKAY,
ARE YOU LISTENING ?

04:29.168 --> 04:30.770
YEAH, MR. TWIST.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.072
YOU'RE ON A FLIGHT
TO ROME IN AN HOUR.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.674
GO STRAIGHT
TO THE MAN.

04:34.741 --> 04:36.042
YOU KNOW WHO
I'M TALKING ABOUT ?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.310
YES, MR. TWIST.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.479
YOU PROSTRATE YOURSELF
BEFORE HIM, UNDERSTAND ?

04:39.545 --> 04:41.714
YOU TELL HIM
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS

04:41.781 --> 04:43.950
THAT WE ARE
VERY, VERY SORRY

04:44.017 --> 04:45.985
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO OVERKILL.

04:46.052 --> 04:48.388
WE SCREWED UP, WE WILL
PAY FOR HIS REPAIR.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.622
YOU GOT THAT ?

04:49.689 --> 04:50.757
YES, MR. TWIST.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.925
YOU'RE SPEAKIN' FOR ME
ON THIS ONE, CONSTELLANO.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.661
YOU BEG HIS
FORGIVENESS.

04:54.727 --> 04:57.397
GET ON YOUR KNEES,
KISS HIS ASS, HIS BALLS,

04:57.463 --> 04:59.499
WHATEVER HE NEEDS FOR
THIS TO BE ALRIGHT.

04:59.565 --> 05:00.833
I UNDERSTAND.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.902
WE GOT OUR TITS IN
A FUCKING RINGER ON THIS !

05:02.969 --> 05:04.637
WE DON'T NEED
TROUBLE FROM ROME.

05:04.704 --> 05:06.773
TELL HIM WE'LL FIX IT
ALL ON OUR END.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.141
DONE DEAL, OKAY.

05:08.207 --> 05:10.410
DON'T WORRY, MR. TWIST,
I GOT IT COVERED.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.011
GET GOING.

06:04.163 --> 06:09.635
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS CRAP'S
BEEN GOING ON WITHOUT ME.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.371
( male )
HEY SWEETIE, DIDN'T
I SEE YOU IN A MAGAZINE ?

06:14.173 --> 06:16.075
GOT A BOYFRIEND,
"BEAVER" TREAT ?

06:16.142 --> 06:19.178
SOMEBODY TO<i> LICK</i>
AWAY YOUR DAY ?

06:19.245 --> 06:20.980
I CAN DO THAT
FOR YOU, BABY.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.417
YOU WANT ME
TO SHOW YOU ?

06:24.484 --> 06:26.252
YEAH, SHOW ME.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.655
IT'S A "BIG CITY GIRL" DAY
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:30.823 --> 06:33.192
YOU A BIG CITY GIRL, BABY ?

06:33.926 --> 06:35.862
GOOD HUNTING'S
WHERE YOU FIND IT.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.730
HUNTING ?

06:37.797 --> 06:40.233
WE GOT OURSELVES SOME
KIND OF SPORTS BABE.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.169
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

06:43.236 --> 06:47.173
OH, DON'T APOLOGIZE BABY,
IT'S ALL OUR FAULT.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.010
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
FUN, FOR US.

06:52.712 --> 06:54.347
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:49.435 --> 07:50.603
LOOK WHO IT IS.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.605
WHAT IS SHE
DOING HERE ?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.775
HEY, YOU CAN'T...

07:55.842 --> 07:58.311
I KNOW SHE'S IN AND
SHE'S GONNA SEE ME.

08:01.113 --> 08:03.850
HOW DARE YOU BURST INTO
MY OFFICE LIKE THIS ?

08:03.916 --> 08:06.052
WHY WASN'T I CALLED
ABOUT THE HELL SPAWN ?

08:06.118 --> 08:08.421
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

08:08.487 --> 08:10.790
YOU'VE HAD ME DELIBERATELY
TAKING OUT OF THE LOOP.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.458
ANGELA, REALLY.

08:12.525 --> 08:14.994
SAVE IT GABRIELLE,
HE'S MINE.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.801
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY HUNTER
IN THE UNIVERSE, ANGELA.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.903
I'VE TAKEN OUT THE
LAST TWO HELL SPAWNS

08:23.970 --> 08:25.938
AND I WANT
THIS ONE !

08:31.244 --> 08:33.212
YOU REALIZE IT'S
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR

08:33.279 --> 08:35.748
THAT MAKES IT
DIFFICULT TO TRUST YOU.

08:40.286 --> 08:42.655
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I DO WELL, IT'S HUNT.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.090
A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE THAT,

08:44.156 --> 08:45.258
INCLUDING YOU,

08:45.324 --> 08:47.159
BUT THAT'S NOT
GONNA STOP ME.

08:47.226 --> 08:49.095
GO THROUGH THE
PROPER CHANNELS.

08:49.161 --> 08:50.663
THOSE CHANNELS
LEAD TO YOU.

08:50.730 --> 08:51.664
I'M RE.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.366
I'M TALKING TO YOU,
AMBASSADOR.

08:53.432 --> 08:54.500
WHAT ABOUT THE PERMIT ?

08:54.567 --> 08:55.835
DENIED.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.637
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA HAVE
IT IN FOR ME, GABBY ?

08:57.703 --> 08:59.372
A CENTURY, TWO ?

08:59.438 --> 09:01.807
FOLLOW APPROPRIATE
PROTOCOL AND<i> MAYBE,</i>

09:01.874 --> 09:03.643
I'LL RECONSIDER.

09:03.709 --> 09:07.914
JUST TRY AND KEEP ME
OUT OF THIS, GABBY.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.049
GOODBYE, ANGELA.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.492
( children laughing )

09:31.103 --> 09:34.273
( Wanda )
HEY, LET THE LITTLE
GUYS HAVE SOME !

09:34.340 --> 09:37.143
ALWAYS PULLING FOR
THE UNDERDOG, EH WANDA ?

09:37.209 --> 09:40.846
YOU KNOW ME...
SO WHAT DO YOU GOT ?

09:50.022 --> 09:51.223
YOU GOT IT ?

09:51.290 --> 09:53.225
TOOK SOME ARM TWISTING
AND GREASING MORE PALMS

09:53.292 --> 09:55.328
THAN YOU'LL FIND IN
A TIMES SQUARE PEEP SHOW,

09:55.394 --> 09:56.963
BUT YEAH,
I GOT IT.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.664
I STILL GOT SOME
FRIENDS ON THE FORCE,

09:58.731 --> 10:00.266
BUT THIS SHIT'S
LIKE EBOLA--

10:00.333 --> 10:02.568
NOBODY WANTS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

10:02.635 --> 10:03.903
NOT HERE.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.538
I DON'T MEAN TO
SOUND PARANOID,

10:05.604 --> 10:07.974
BUT WHAT YOU GOT
THERE IS BIG.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.508
HOW BIG, MAX ?

10:09.575 --> 10:11.243
RAW EVIDENCE FROM
THE LAST KID.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.212
UNCUT, UNEDITED.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.649
AND A LATENT PRINT OFF
THE LITTLE GIRL'S EYEBALL.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.784
CLEAR AS CHRISTMAS.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.453
AN ACTUAL
FINGERPRINT ?

10:20.519 --> 10:22.455
DONE FROM THE LEFT HAND
OF YOUR PERP.

10:22.521 --> 10:23.589
NOT WATSON'S ?

10:23.656 --> 10:26.325
NO, THIS PRINT
BELONGS TO YOUR KILLER.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.694
I WAS RIGHT.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.129
KYLE WATSON
WAS SET UP

10:30.196 --> 10:32.131
TO TAKE THE FALL
FOR THOSE CHILD MURDERS.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.532
THIS PROVES IT.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.501
I THINK YOU WANT TO
SAVE THE CHAMPAGNE.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.337
THIS SON-OF-A-BITCH
WAS PURPOSELY MISFILED,

10:38.404 --> 10:40.039
VAULTED AND BURIED.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.475
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT A CONSPIRACY

10:42.541 --> 10:44.010
INSIDE THE POLICE ?

10:44.076 --> 10:46.012
I THINK MAYBE IT GOES
BEYOND THAT, WANDA.

10:46.078 --> 10:48.614
SOMEONE'S COVERING
THIS SICK BASTARD'S ASS,

10:48.681 --> 10:51.717
SOMEONE WITH
A LOT OF MUSCLE.

10:51.784 --> 10:52.818
WHO ?

10:52.885 --> 10:54.053
HONESTLY, I DON'T
WANT TO KNOW

10:54.120 --> 10:55.321
AND NEITHER
SHOULD YOU.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.689
WATCH YOUR BACK, WANDA.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.290
THANKS MAX,
I OWE YOU.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.159
YOU'LL GET MY
CONSULTATION FEE.

11:00.226 --> 11:02.995
MAX, YOU'RE AMAZING.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.563
WOOF, WOOF !

11:22.915 --> 11:25.451
WHY ARE YOU
FOLLOWING HER ?

11:27.586 --> 11:29.622
I'M TALKING
TO YOU, DIRTBAG.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.829
NOT A HEALTHY IDEA.

11:38.931 --> 11:40.332
AHH !

11:52.578 --> 11:55.381
I WANT ANSWERS NOW !

11:58.984 --> 12:01.587
STARTING WITH
YOUR BOSS' NAME.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.362
( sirens )

12:26.312 --> 12:27.947
( Wynn )
GO ON, I'M LISTENING.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.883
I JUST WANTED TO FIND
THOSE CODE NUMBERS.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.385
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN CODE NUMBERS, TERRY.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.521
WE LOST A RATHER LARGE
NUMBER OF WEAPONS

12:35.588 --> 12:37.389
FROM THAT ORDINANCE
ANNEX A WEEK AGO.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.091
YES I KNOW, BUT WHAT
I'M GETTING AT...

12:39.158 --> 12:42.194
I WANT A SOLID CONCISE
ANALYSIS FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT

12:42.261 --> 12:44.130
TELLING ME WHO
COULD HAVE DONE THIS.

12:52.638 --> 12:54.907
THEY HAD THE
SON-OF-A-BITCH CORNERED

12:54.974 --> 12:56.041
AND SOMEHOW
HE GOT AWAY.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.711
WEAPONS AND ALL,
IMPOSSIBLE !

12:58.777 --> 13:00.613
INCREDIBLE.

13:00.679 --> 13:03.048
I HAVEN'T SEEN A MANEUVER
LIKE THAT SINCE...

13:03.115 --> 13:04.917
AL SIMMONS.

13:04.984 --> 13:06.585
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO EXPLAIN THIS SCREW UP

13:06.652 --> 13:07.887
TO THE PRESIDENT.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.789
IT MAY HAVE BEEN
AN INSIDE JOB, SIR.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.191
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

13:12.258 --> 13:16.729
WELL I'VE BEEN RUNNING SOME
CATALOGING REPORTS ON MY OWN

13:16.795 --> 13:18.531
AND I CAUGHT SOME
CODE DISCREPANCIES

13:18.597 --> 13:19.999
IN OUR WEAPON
STORAGE FILES.

13:20.065 --> 13:21.233
GO ON.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.369
I DID SOME CHECKING
AND CRAZY AS IT SOUNDS

13:23.435 --> 13:25.738
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE MIGHT
BE DIVERTING WEAPON SHIPMENTS

13:25.804 --> 13:27.206
TO OTHER DELIVERY SIGHTS

13:27.273 --> 13:28.774
THEN CHANGING THE INFO
IN THE COMPUTER.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.376
YOU HAVE ANY
PROOF OF THIS ?

13:30.442 --> 13:32.344
IT'S ALL HERE
IN MY REPORT.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.049
WHO ELSE HAVE YOU
TALKED TO ABOUT THIS ?

13:37.116 --> 13:38.250
NO ONE, SIR.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.286
I WANTED TO COME
STRAIGHT TO YOU.

13:40.352 --> 13:41.987
EXCELLENT,
I'M GLAD YOU DID.

13:42.054 --> 13:43.289
AS OF RIGHT NOW TERRY,

13:43.355 --> 13:44.790
YOUR JOB IS
TO TRACK DOWN

13:44.857 --> 13:46.659
EVERY INSTANCE
OF THESE DISCREPANCIES

13:46.725 --> 13:48.194
IN THE WEAPONS
SHIPMENT FILES.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.329
I'LL NEED VERIFICATION
AND DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE

13:50.396 --> 13:52.731
IF I'M GOING TO GET INTO THIS
WITH A FULL SCALE INVESTIGATION.

13:52.798 --> 13:53.799
YES, SIR.

13:53.866 --> 13:55.034
KEEP ME INFORMED.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.970
I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD
AND SAY I HOPE I'M WRONG.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.140
I HOPE THIS IS JUST
SOME HORRIBLE MIX-UP.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.775
I'LL SECOND THAT.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.176
THANK YOU, TERRY.

14:06.245 --> 14:07.813
GODAMN BOY SCOUT !

14:07.880 --> 14:09.782
LAST THING I NEED IS HIM
TURNING A FEW HEADS

14:09.848 --> 14:11.550
BY TALKING
TO SOMEONE.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.552
FORTUNATELY TERRY'S
A LOYAL PUPPET.

14:13.619 --> 14:16.889
ALWAYS WORKS IN THE BEST
INTERESTS OF HIS EMPLOYER.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.191
LET HIM FIND
ALL THE LOOSE ENDS,

14:19.258 --> 14:20.926
WE'LL TIE THEM UP LATER.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.962
RIGHT NOW, I NEED TO
FIND THOSE WEAPONS.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.265
SOMEHOW, KEEP US
ON OUR TIMETABLE.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.168
RECOVERED IMAGES FROM
OVERKILL'S INTERNAL CAMERA.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.738
ROME WILL WANT TONY'S
FAT ASS FOR THIS.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.774
NOTHING LIKE A HOME VIDEO
OF YOUR OWN EVISCERATION.

14:35.841 --> 14:37.309
( Overkill )
I thought you
were dead !

14:37.376 --> 14:38.744
( Spawn )
I am.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.913
You've got some balls
coming here, hero !

14:43.582 --> 14:45.884
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ?

14:47.319 --> 14:49.355
AND WHAT'S IT DOING
WITH MY WEAPONS ?

14:51.056 --> 14:52.791
Who's laughing now ?

15:01.200 --> 15:04.270
( clown )
DARKNESS IS ALL
AROUND YOU SPAWN.

15:04.336 --> 15:08.574
WE BOTH KNOW IT,
WE BOTH FEEL IT.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.543
IT'S CLOSING IN
ON YOU<i> CHAR</i> BOY.

15:11.610 --> 15:15.314
HEAVEN ON ONE SIDE
AND HELL ON THE OTHER.

15:15.381 --> 15:18.384
WE'RE BOTH GUNNIN'
FOR YOUR SCORCHED ASS !

15:18.450 --> 15:22.921
IT'S SO NICE
BEING WET.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.883
DICKHEAD PUTS A GUN
IN HIS MOUTH

15:50.949 --> 15:53.252
AND BLOWS HIS BRAINS
CLEAR ACROSS THE EAST RIVER.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.287
HOMICIDE MY ASS.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.323
ANYTHING ?

15:57.389 --> 15:59.291
SOME VERY TWISTED
INDIVIDUALS

15:59.358 --> 16:01.060
IN OUR NATIONS
CAPITOL, SIR.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.362
WHY THEY'RE WILLING TO
EXPRESS SUCH INTIMATE,

16:03.429 --> 16:06.198
OFTEN SEXUAL THOUGHTS,
OVER A CELL PHONE,

16:06.265 --> 16:07.800
I'LL NEVER KNOW.

16:07.866 --> 16:09.301
I'LL TELL YOU
WHY, TWITCH.

16:09.368 --> 16:11.236
PEOPLE ARE
FREAKING MORONS !

16:11.303 --> 16:12.538
SO HOW MUCH MORE ?

16:12.604 --> 16:15.074
MR. STEVENS HAD A VERY
EXTENSIVE LIBRARY

16:15.140 --> 16:17.009
OF PIRATED
CONVERSATIONS.

16:17.076 --> 16:21.347
THERE'S PERHAPS ANOTHER
40 OR 50 HOURS, AT LEAST.

16:21.413 --> 16:24.483
OH CHRIST, WE AIN'T
GOT THAT KIND OF TIME.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.353
CHIEF'S ALL OVER THIS
ALLEY DEATH-SPREE SHIT !

16:27.419 --> 16:30.522
AT LEAST THERE HAVEN'T BEEN
ANYMORE KILLINGS, SIR.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.858
YEAH... WHAT ?

16:32.925 --> 16:35.060
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER ?

16:35.127 --> 16:37.763
IT'S THE FREAKIN' CALM
BEFORE THE FREAKIN' MONSOON !

16:37.830 --> 16:39.331
QUITE RIGHT, SIR.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.467
THE BUZZ ON THE STREET
HAD OVERKILL IN TOWN,

16:41.533 --> 16:43.268
WHICH SHOULD HAVE MEANT
A BLOODBATH SOMEWHERE,

16:43.335 --> 16:44.870
BUT NOBODY'S
SEEN HIM IN A WEEK

16:44.937 --> 16:46.405
AND NOBODY
SAW HIM LEAVE.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.741
HE'S HARD
TO MISS, SIR.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.579
EXACTLY.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.581
IT'S WEIRD CRAP,
THIS WHOLE STINKIN' BUSINESS.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.750
I'LL TELL YOU TWITCH,
I HATE LOOSE ENDS.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.251
THEY PISS ME OFF.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.755
( reporter )
And on the national front,

17:02.821 --> 17:05.124
outspoken republican senator
Scott McMillan

17:05.190 --> 17:08.026
has unexpectedly thrown his hat
into the presidential ring.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.928
The American people
want someone

17:09.995 --> 17:11.697
to step into
the White House

17:11.764 --> 17:13.532
and put an end
to overinflated,

17:13.599 --> 17:16.068
underachieving,
"tax and spend" government.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.537
Our nation needs
someone on the front lines

17:18.604 --> 17:20.539
who isn't afraid
to give the government

17:20.606 --> 17:22.107
the thorough
house-cleaning

17:22.174 --> 17:24.042
it's needed for
a very long time

17:24.109 --> 17:27.079
and I am
that someone.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.548
TWITCH, YOU SHOULD
SEE THIS GUY,

17:29.615 --> 17:30.849
HE'S GOT 'EM EATING

WASHINGTON D.C. SIR.

17:37.956 --> 17:41.560

WORKED FOR THE POST ?

17:41.627 --> 17:42.861
NO, SIR.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.397
IF YOU TAKE
A LOOK AT LINE 26

17:45.464 --> 17:48.667
UNDER HIS I.D. AND
FINGERPRINT REPORT.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.570
WELL SHIT ON ME
AND CALL ME A SUNDAE !

17:51.637 --> 17:56.074
MR. HUMBLE HERE WORKS FOR
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

HMM...

17:57.609 --> 18:01.113

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.183
WEIRDER AND WEIRDER.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.884
A GUY FALLS
OUT OF A TREE,

18:05.951 --> 18:07.386
BREAKS HIS ARM
IN THREE PLACES,

18:07.453 --> 18:09.154
THEN BLOWS
HIS BRAINS OUT.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.856
FOR WHAT ?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.224
ACTUALLY, THE
REPORT STATES

18:12.291 --> 18:14.259
THAT HUMBLE'S ARM
WAS BROKEN BY ASSAILANT

18:14.326 --> 18:15.861
OR ASSAILANTS
UNKNOWN.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.529
YEAH, YEAH,
WHATEVER.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.632
WHY CAN'T THESE D.C. ASSHOLES
DIE IN THEIR OWN GODAMN TOWN ?

18:22.601 --> 18:24.970
VERY INCONSIDERATE
OF THEM, SIR.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.138
SHUT UP, TWITCH.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.469
( screams )

19:03.242 --> 19:05.577
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THIS !?

19:10.883 --> 19:12.718
NO ONE CAN
KNOW I'M HERE.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.887
YOU DON'T JUST BUST IN
AND FUCK WITH ME.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.054
SHUT UP, TONY.

19:16.121 --> 19:17.789
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE CREATURE

19:17.856 --> 19:19.491
ON THAT VIDEO
YOU SENT ME ?

19:19.558 --> 19:22.828
NOTHING, JUST THAT HE'S
ONE LETHAL SON-OF-A-BITCH.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.163
ANYONE WHO CAN
WHACK OUT OVERKILL.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.533
I NEED IT FOUND.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.535
BUT I CAN'T DO
IT DIRECTLY.

19:29.601 --> 19:30.836
HEY, FORGET IT.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.538
THAT BASTARD TOLD ME
TO STAY OUT OF HIS WAY

19:32.604 --> 19:33.839
AND BELIEVE-YOU-ME,

19:33.906 --> 19:35.741
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.576
THIS ISN'T A REQUEST.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.611
YOU FIND HIM THEN
YOU CONTACT ME,

19:39.678 --> 19:43.482
AND MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU DEAL
WITH YOUR ITALIAN SITUATION.

19:43.549 --> 19:44.750
WHAT'S THIS ?

19:44.816 --> 19:46.718
A PACKAGE
FROM ROME.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.887
MY PEOPLE INTERCEPTED IT
FROM YOUR PEOPLE.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.689
YOU HAVING
MY GUYS FOLLOWED ?

19:50.756 --> 19:52.891
I KEEP TABS
ON ALL MY FRIENDS.

BE HONORED.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.194

20:15.747 --> 20:17.883
AND YOUR OWN SECURITY
CAMERAS VERIFY IT !

20:17.950 --> 20:19.418
KELLY, THE BAD PRESS ALONE

20:19.484 --> 20:20.919

YOU'RE OFFERING !

20:20.986 --> 20:22.821
LOOK KELLY,
I GOTTA GO.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.423

20:24.489 --> 20:27.960
MORE MONEY THAT'S WHAT I
WANT TO CLOSE THIS CASE.

20:28.026 --> 20:30.662
MORE MONEY,
THE LAWYER'S MOTTO.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.231
I PULLED THE CIVIL CASE ON
THE REINHARDT CHEMICAL FIRE

20:33.298 --> 20:34.967
TWO MONTHS AGO, I'M
TRYING TO SETTLE IT.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.602
YEAH, I REMEMBER
THAT ONE.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.270
THE TWO KIDS
IN THE STOREROOM.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.905
WHAT A WAY
TO GO, BRUTAL.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.441
WELL, THE REINHARDT
FAMILY IS POOR.

20:42.507 --> 20:45.210
THEY WANT US TO TAKE THE FIRST
OFFER THROWN ON THE TABLE.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.679
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BITE.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.817
THEY HAD TO USE DENTAL
RECORDS TO IDENTIFY THEM !

20:51.883 --> 20:55.220
YOU KNOW WANDA, MONEY WON'T
BRING THOSE DEAD KIDS BACK.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.189
YEAH, I KNOW.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.890
SO, DID YOU
GET IT ?

20:58.957 --> 21:00.592
YEAH, AND LET ME
TELL YOU

21:00.659 --> 21:02.561
I HAD TO CALL IN
SOME SERIOUS FAVORS.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.663
THESE GOVERNMENT GUYS
PROTECT THIS HIGH TECH SHIT

21:04.730 --> 21:06.431
LIKE IT'S THEIR BALLS.

21:06.498 --> 21:08.567
BUT BEFORE I GIVE
THIS TO YOU,

21:08.634 --> 21:11.837
YOU GOT TO PROMISE ME YOU
WON'T DO SOMETHING STUPID.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.806
I PAY, YOU BRING, THAT'S
ALWAYS BEEN OUR DEAL.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.675
BUT I APPRECIATE
THE CONCERN.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.176
SO WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE ?

21:18.243 --> 21:20.679
WE HAVE SOME HEAVY DUTY
SHIT HERE, THAT'S WHAT.

21:20.746 --> 21:22.614
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, WANDA.

21:22.681 --> 21:24.950
THAT'S SWEET,
BUT I'M A BIG GIRL,

21:25.017 --> 21:26.718
AND I NEED
THAT DISK, PLEASE.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.153
HERE YOU GO.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.821
BUT REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.593
SO WHAT'S
YOUR PLAN ?

21:34.660 --> 21:36.561
I'M GONNA TRY TO ACCESS
THE GOVERNMENT'S DATA BASE

21:36.628 --> 21:37.829
AND BREAK INTO
THEIR SYSTEM

21:37.896 --> 21:39.364
TO FIND OUT
WHO FRAMED WATSON.

21:39.431 --> 21:40.532
DON'T BE CRAZY,

21:40.599 --> 21:42.601
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
MESSING WITH THESE GUYS.

21:42.668 --> 21:45.237
SOMEONE WITH POWER
IS PROTECTING
A CHILD-KILLER.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.538
I NEED TO FIND OUT WHO.

21:46.605 --> 21:48.373
YOU GOT WATSON OFF.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.109
WHY THE HELL DO YOU WANT
TO GO ON SOME HOLY CRUSADE

21:51.176 --> 21:52.577
TO FIND
THIS GUY ?!

21:52.644 --> 21:55.347
BECAUSE MONEY DOESN'T
BRING DEAD KIDS BACK.

21:58.316 --> 22:00.485
WE'LL NEVER
BE APART, NEVER.

22:00.552 --> 22:03.922
WHAT A PERFECT DAY,
YOU MAKE ME SO HAPPY.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.992
I LOVE YOU
SO MUCH, AL.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.861
AL WAS NEVER ENOUGH FOR
A WOMAN LIKE YOU, WANDA.

22:09.928 --> 22:12.631
HIS DEATH WAS THE BEST THING
THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.067
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

22:15.133 --> 22:17.769
( screams )

22:22.107 --> 22:23.108
WANDA !

22:24.843 --> 22:28.480
WANDA, WANDA !

22:46.998 --> 22:48.934
WAIT, WAIT !

22:49.000 --> 22:50.469
IT'S ME,
CRAIG GAREB.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.270
REMEMBER ME, GAREB ?!

22:52.337 --> 22:54.172
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KILL ME, RIGHT ?

22:54.239 --> 22:55.107
GAREB ?

22:55.173 --> 22:56.641
YEAH.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.010
CAN I BREATHE NOW ?

23:01.146 --> 23:03.548
ANOTHER NIGHTMARE, HUH ?

23:03.615 --> 23:06.151
I GET 'EM REAL BAD
SOMETIMES,

23:06.218 --> 23:09.755
REMEMBERING WHEN MY FOLKS
PUT ME IN THE HOSPITAL.

23:09.821 --> 23:13.525
SAID I WAS, YOU KNOW,
<i>TOUCHED</i> IN THE HEAD.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.560
I THOUGHT SOME
DOWN-TIME WOULD HELP,

23:15.627 --> 23:18.864
GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO SORT THINGS OUT.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.332
SEEMS LIKE
THE MORE I THINK,

23:20.398 --> 23:21.967
THE WORSE THE
NIGHTMARES GET.

23:22.033 --> 23:25.370
AND I CAN'T
SHUT IT OFF.

23:25.437 --> 23:26.705
YOU HUNGRY ?

23:26.772 --> 23:29.341
I GOT A GOOD DEAL ON
A HALF LOAF OF BREAD.

23:29.407 --> 23:31.343
ONLY A WEEK OLD.

23:31.409 --> 23:33.745
STILL GOT SOME OF THE
PLASTIC WRAP AROUND IT.

23:33.812 --> 23:35.781
GO AWAY, GAREB.

23:35.847 --> 23:37.849
YOU KNOW,

23:37.916 --> 23:41.253
YOU SHOULDN'T SIT DOWN
HERE ALONE ALL THE TIME.

23:41.319 --> 23:43.622
IT AIN'T HEALTHY.

23:43.688 --> 23:45.791
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT MY HEALTH.

23:45.857 --> 23:48.527
I'VE GOT TO FIGURE
THINGS OUT.

23:53.298 --> 23:55.467
MAYBE YOU NEED TO QUIT
ALL THIS FIGURING

23:55.534 --> 23:57.936
AND JUST DO
SOMETHING.

23:58.003 --> 24:01.306
OF COURSE WHAT
DO I KNOW, RIGHT ?

24:01.373 --> 24:05.477
I'M JUST A BUM WITH A HALF
OF LOAF OF MOLDY BREAD.

24:05.544 --> 24:08.947
NOBODY TO SHARE IT WITH
EXCEPT MY BUDDIES,

24:09.014 --> 24:12.584
JACK DANIELS
AND JIM BEAM.

24:18.690 --> 24:22.093
YOU HAVE A FRIEND THERE,
SPAWN, LISTEN TO HIM.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.363
BEAT IT OLD MAN,
I'M IN NO MOOD.

24:30.936 --> 24:34.706
MOMENTS OF WISDOM ARE FEW
FOR THE NEW WARRIORS.

24:34.773 --> 24:38.810
THEY COME FROM
UNEXPECTED SOURCES.

24:47.118 --> 24:49.020
BUT ALWAYS,

24:49.087 --> 24:52.591
WARRIORS FEEL EVENTS
CHURNING AROUND THEM.

24:52.657 --> 24:56.328
SPIRALING,
CLOSING IN.

24:56.394 --> 24:59.598
SOME SIT AND WAIT
TOO LONG.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.133
OTHERS LISTEN
TO THEIR INSTINCTS

25:02.200 --> 25:04.069
AND PREPARE.
