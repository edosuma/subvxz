WEBVTT

00:07.458 --> 00:11.801
WOMAN: I need to get
this baby out. One, two, three.

00:11.834 --> 00:15.073
(woman screaming)

00:21.252 --> 00:22.589
Dana.

00:24.793 --> 00:26.128
This is too hard.

00:27.599 --> 00:28.701
Do you want a hint?

00:30.270 --> 00:32.809
-Why can't you just read to me?
-I could.

00:32.842 --> 00:34.780
But you need to
learn to read on your own.

00:34.813 --> 00:36.249
Why?

00:36.282 --> 00:37.451
DANA: Because it's important.

00:40.758 --> 00:42.294
Maybe we're going too fast.

00:42.896 --> 00:44.299
Yeah?

00:44.332 --> 00:46.135
-Let's um-- -(faint thud)

00:48.239 --> 00:49.576
Hey.

00:53.316 --> 00:55.153
Do you want to come
closer so you can see?

00:59.295 --> 01:00.564
(water bucket thuds)

01:06.342 --> 01:09.583
You know, if you both learn,

01:09.616 --> 01:11.319
you can write to each other.

01:13.624 --> 01:15.360
Come on.
Show Carrie what you can do.

01:16.329 --> 01:17.397
This is the letter M.

01:17.966 --> 01:19.536
What sound does
the letter M make?

01:21.272 --> 01:23.343
-Mmm.
-Good.

01:24.311 --> 01:25.915
Good. Okay, and the next one?

01:25.948 --> 01:29.789
-Uh-- -WOMAN: Carrie. Carrie.

01:33.798 --> 01:35.400
You must be
crazier than I thought.

01:35.935 --> 01:38.239
Luke asked me to
teach Nigel how to read.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.212
-I thought Carrie might want
to learn-- -Carrie, come here.

01:43.349 --> 01:44.418
Carrie.

01:45.755 --> 01:47.726
You're the only one
who really understands her.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.297
-What happens when you're gone?
-Ever since you've got here

01:50.330 --> 01:52.569
with all your good intentions,
bad things been happening.

01:52.602 --> 01:56.208
Tom starving us out
over Winnie. Celeste dead.

01:57.679 --> 01:59.849
-That wasn't my fault.
-You sure about that?

02:01.687 --> 02:04.258
If this was Luke's idea
and I don't believe for a second

02:04.291 --> 02:06.630
that it was, but if so, then
he ain't in his right mind.

02:06.663 --> 02:09.402
And you know what would happen
if you get caught
doing something like this?

02:09.435 --> 02:11.607
He ain't got no right
to take us all down with him.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.747
But at least Luke
is doing something to give Nigel
a better chance at life.

02:14.780 --> 02:16.683
Luke don't even know
what a better life look like.

02:17.451 --> 02:20.390
Carrie, you are never to be
alone with Miss Dana again,
you hear me?

02:21.727 --> 02:23.296
Now go.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.302
(footsteps receding)

02:28.239 --> 02:29.709
You got any
sense, you run along too.

02:30.310 --> 02:33.417
'Cause you lucky it was me and
not Massa Tom or that evil Jake.

02:33.450 --> 02:35.253
Your father and this
one gonna get you killed.

02:37.492 --> 02:38.560
Or worse.

02:41.365 --> 02:42.835
(footsteps receding)

02:50.918 --> 02:53.891
It's okay, Nigel,
nothing bad is gonna happen.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.494
We'll do more tomorrow.

02:57.297 --> 02:58.433
Okay.

03:21.412 --> 03:23.584
KEVIN: I'm really glad
you're coming to Easton.

03:25.755 --> 03:27.357
He thinks we're friends.

03:28.293 --> 03:30.731
Can't say I'm not excited
to get off this farm, though.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.002
See more of the world.

03:33.571 --> 03:35.741
If you got stuck
here, could be fun to travel.

03:36.510 --> 03:38.847
Sure, sounds
fun if you're white.

03:44.726 --> 03:47.397
Okay. Or we could go home.

03:49.368 --> 03:52.843
I told you, I told Luke
that I'd teach Nigel to read.

03:52.876 --> 03:54.411
KEVIN: Yeah,
but how long will that take?

03:56.984 --> 04:01.527
I just... (sighs) ...I don't
feel like I've done everything
I came here to do.

04:01.560 --> 04:04.700
You were brought here to
save Rufus's life. That's it.

04:04.733 --> 04:07.506
What's gonna happen to
these kids when we leave?

04:07.539 --> 04:09.408
And Carrie,
what's gonna happen to her?

04:09.441 --> 04:12.381
Is it just gonna be Tom
and Celeste all over again?

04:12.414 --> 04:15.286
It can't just be
Rufus, we have to save them all.

04:24.606 --> 04:26.510
I don't know
what will happen, Dana,

04:26.543 --> 04:28.514
but I know that if
we try to save the world,

04:28.547 --> 04:29.983
we will lose our fucking minds.

04:34.559 --> 04:36.630
Oh, Maggie, my sister.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.403
Rufus, come greet your Aunt May.

04:41.773 --> 04:43.409
-Come here.
-(Margaret giggling)

04:45.146 --> 04:47.718
MAY: What a very fine
young man you've become.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.693
Every year he looks
more like our father.

04:53.764 --> 04:55.634
And this is Mr. Franklin.

04:56.503 --> 05:00.077
MAY: Mr. Franklin? Not
the musician?

05:00.110 --> 05:01.378
May.

05:02.414 --> 05:03.917
How do you do?

05:04.451 --> 05:08.761
I seem to recall my sister
making very fond mention
of you in a letter.

05:08.794 --> 05:11.398
How is it you've come to
return after all these years?

05:14.873 --> 05:16.810
Yet to be decided, I see.

05:16.843 --> 05:19.382
-Will you be visiting long?
-MAY: Oh, no.

05:19.415 --> 05:21.687
I'll return to
Baltimore tomorrow.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.960
I'd hate to deprive Rufus
of his bed for too many nights,

05:24.993 --> 05:28.400
seeing as
the guest room is occupied.

05:28.433 --> 05:29.936
TOM: Kevin, Rufus.

05:30.571 --> 05:32.976
May, what a pleasant surprise.

05:33.009 --> 05:36.082
It's not a surprise. We planned
this visit for months.

05:36.115 --> 05:38.654
Yeah, well,
it must've slipped my mind.

05:39.355 --> 05:41.627
Rufus and I will
see you when we return.

05:41.660 --> 05:45.167
Must he go with you? May has
come all this way to see Rufus.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.872
Should I leave my
son to gossip over tea?

05:52.014 --> 05:55.554
Come along, Franklin. Luke
has a horse ready for you.

05:58.761 --> 06:01.031
-MAY: Maggie. Maggie.
-(door slams)

06:01.232 --> 06:02.902
A horse, like, to ride?

06:03.738 --> 06:06.476
MARGARET: You planned this
knowing my sister is to visit.

06:06.510 --> 06:08.714
Do you see how
inconsiderate you are?

06:09.182 --> 06:11.787
TOM: Uh, we'll be meeting
a few other planters in Easton.

06:11.820 --> 06:14.559
Rufus is old enough to
be learning a few things.

06:14.592 --> 06:18.567
-MARGARET: What business must
be done today besides drinking?
-TOM: Hush woman.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.575
A pity. I so hope to spend at
least some of this time with
my nephew.

06:22.608 --> 06:24.679
We'll only be gone half the day.

06:25.313 --> 06:26.816
Your horse, Mr. Franklin.

06:37.137 --> 06:38.541
I got-- Oh, I got it.

06:38.574 --> 06:39.742
(sighs) Okay.

06:40.611 --> 06:41.813
(Franklin clears throat)

06:44.953 --> 06:46.623
Uh, should Dana
ride with me or--

06:46.656 --> 06:50.029
Nonsense, this trip
is for men. Let's go.

06:50.731 --> 06:53.671
DANA: It's just a few hours,
okay? Stay close to Rufus.

06:53.704 --> 06:54.772
TOM: Mr. Franklin!

06:57.678 --> 06:58.747
(horse blows)

07:03.924 --> 07:05.426
(horse grunts)

07:06.228 --> 07:08.967
My sister and
I desire tea in the parlor.

07:09.334 --> 07:11.472
Fetch it for us. Now.

07:11.506 --> 07:15.080
Uh-- Oh-- Uh-- I-- Actually,
I-- I told Mr. Franklin I'd--

07:15.113 --> 07:17.150
You and I both
know that's not true.

07:18.252 --> 07:20.791
Tea. Now.

07:39.696 --> 07:41.599
Miss Margaret and
her sister want tea.

07:43.837 --> 07:45.206
You know where the kettle is.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.228
-(sizzling)
-Fuck.

07:57.799 --> 07:59.134
(sighs)

08:02.742 --> 08:03.944
RUFUS: Where are we?

08:03.977 --> 08:06.950
This is where your father
grew up.

08:08.687 --> 08:11.727
When my daddy first
taught me how to till the soil.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.532
Taught us.
Ain't that right, Luke?

08:15.066 --> 08:17.237
-LUKE: Master William was
a fine planter. -TOM: Mmm-hmm.

08:18.139 --> 08:21.145
I was half your age, son, when
he failed to return from battle.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.990
KEVIN: You two
grew up together here?

08:28.192 --> 08:29.261
TOM: We did.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.267
I was born right after Luke.

08:32.300 --> 08:33.737
We were the only boys here.

08:34.438 --> 08:37.277
Two sisters
before me, one after.

08:37.310 --> 08:41.151
But Luke was the closest
thing I had to a brother.

08:41.653 --> 08:43.323
I had two brothers in my home.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.692
Died of fever.

08:45.293 --> 08:47.030
Can Nigel and I go play?

08:48.867 --> 08:50.002
Yeah, go ahead son.

08:54.779 --> 08:57.651
Owner finally passed and
this land is for sale again.

09:00.156 --> 09:02.928
What say you,
Luke? Should I acquire it?

09:03.964 --> 09:05.233
You know, we could expand.

09:06.670 --> 09:09.008
And this land would
be under your charge.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.647
Go ahead. Grab a handful.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.283
Tell me how
you find its prospects.

09:13.316 --> 09:15.621
I don't need to touch it
to see the lands worthless.

09:17.091 --> 09:20.096
But why should that stop you?
Wouldn't be the first thing
you took for yourself

09:20.129 --> 09:21.900
just for the sake of taking.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.257
I'm ready to move
on. Fetch the boys.

09:39.702 --> 09:40.804
(horse grunts)

09:44.812 --> 09:46.850
You'll have to excuse Luke,
uh...

09:48.452 --> 09:53.797
he had a friendship with
a slave who recently passed.

09:53.830 --> 09:57.271
I thought bringing him
along on this trip might
cheer him up some.

09:57.304 --> 09:59.408
-He's grieving.
-TOM: Yeah, I'm aware.

09:59.441 --> 10:03.684
But there's
nothing more tiresome

10:03.717 --> 10:05.821
than a melancholy slave.

10:13.870 --> 10:18.313
-(May plays on piano)
-MAY: Oh, thank you.

10:18.346 --> 10:22.287
My sister is upstairs
freshening up with the mute.

10:26.161 --> 10:27.698
(cutlery clanking)

10:33.844 --> 10:37.785
You belong to
Mr. Franklin, do you not?

10:37.818 --> 10:41.358
-Yes, ma'am. -He's
giving Margaret piano lessons?

10:42.260 --> 10:44.431
-Yes.
-Funny.

10:44.464 --> 10:47.271
I never knew
Maggie to be very musical,

10:47.304 --> 10:49.441
but if he's lifting
her spirits... (chuckles)

10:53.015 --> 10:57.023
Hi. What a beautiful day.

10:58.059 --> 11:00.697
Won't you give me
a tour of the grounds, Maggie?

11:01.566 --> 11:04.305
And I suppose
I should meet our cousin Jake.

11:04.338 --> 11:07.443
My husband did pay for
his voyage over, after all.

11:08.914 --> 11:10.082
(tea splashes)

11:11.853 --> 11:14.158
-It's cold.
-I'm sorry, I'll go get--

11:14.191 --> 11:15.259
MARGARET: Stay.

11:19.134 --> 11:21.372
You and
Mr. Franklin share a room,

11:21.405 --> 11:24.011
well aware
that it is against my rules.

11:24.044 --> 11:27.084
So which one of you is it
that can't control themselves?

11:27.117 --> 11:28.385
Answer me.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.895
-Margaret.
-Answer me.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.199
(tea splashes)

11:38.874 --> 11:39.942
(cup clanks)

11:41.913 --> 11:43.482
You can fetch me a proper cup.

11:54.939 --> 11:56.141
Hey, Willy.

12:08.800 --> 12:09.869
Come on, son.

12:12.842 --> 12:13.910
That's a boy.

12:15.948 --> 12:17.819
Go along now and fetch
my order at the printer.

12:17.852 --> 12:18.987
NIGEL: Yes, sir.

12:21.091 --> 12:22.160
Hey.

12:23.262 --> 12:24.765
I heard about Celeste.

12:27.404 --> 12:31.411
Wanted to check and see if
you were feeling... all right.

12:33.550 --> 12:34.919
No, I'm not all right.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.060
You worrying about me,
it ain't good for anybody.

12:41.465 --> 12:42.935
TOM: Mr. Franklin.

12:51.285 --> 12:52.353
RUFUS: Where are we, Daddy?

12:52.788 --> 12:54.826
TOM: Oh, it's
a momentous occasion.

12:54.859 --> 12:57.931
You, my son, are
getting your first proper shave.

12:58.833 --> 13:02.007
As are you. I need my
company looking distinguished.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.108
A barber will sort you.

13:03.577 --> 13:06.550
Uh, how much does a barber cost?

13:06.583 --> 13:08.385
I'm short on funds.

13:11.058 --> 13:14.264
Don't worry yourself,
Mr. Franklin. I'm well aware
of your shallow pot.

13:14.297 --> 13:15.967
NIGEL:
Master Weylin. Master Weylin.

13:19.274 --> 13:21.145
I don't got no whiskers.

13:21.178 --> 13:23.884
-What'll they shave?
-Don't worry.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.957
Uh, I think shaving
makes your whiskers grow
sometimes.

13:26.990 --> 13:29.227
I don't know. I read that once.

13:30.029 --> 13:32.167
-TOM: Put them up front with
your father. -NIGEL: Yes, sir.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.536
Meet me at
the barber when you're done.

13:38.479 --> 13:39.548
(bell rings)

13:45.460 --> 13:46.529
(cutlery clanking)

13:48.432 --> 13:49.869
Tea was too cold, huh?

13:55.213 --> 13:56.415
TOM: Benjamin.

13:56.884 --> 13:58.152
BEN: Tommy, my boy.

13:58.654 --> 14:00.457
-Ben, how are you, sir?
-BEN: Ah.

14:00.490 --> 14:03.463
Fine, but what a boon to
find you off the plantation.

14:03.497 --> 14:05.467
May I introduce Mr. Franklin?

14:05.501 --> 14:08.372
He's a musician
and a guest in my home.

14:09.007 --> 14:11.445
-Pleasure to meet you.
-A musician?

14:11.478 --> 14:13.883
Who knew you to be
a patron of the arts?

14:14.484 --> 14:17.224
And who is this fine young man?

14:17.257 --> 14:18.560
TOM: Get up, son.

14:18.593 --> 14:20.063
I'm Rufus Weylin, sir.

14:20.096 --> 14:22.067
-Rufus Weylin?
-(Tom chuckles)

14:22.100 --> 14:25.674
I did not recognize you beneath
all of that shaving cream.

14:25.707 --> 14:28.179
-No school today?
-RUFUS: No more school for me.

14:28.212 --> 14:30.016
Learning the planter business.

14:30.049 --> 14:32.487
-That right, Daddy?
-Indeed, son.

14:32.521 --> 14:34.291
-(Ben chuckles)
-You here for an appointment?

14:34.324 --> 14:35.628
Me? Never.

14:35.661 --> 14:38.298
I have a boy at home
for my grooming.

14:39.100 --> 14:42.073
More convenient. I picked him
up on a trip to South Carolina.

14:42.608 --> 14:45.180
I was just passing by
on the way to fill my belly

14:45.213 --> 14:47.952
and I saw
your slave driver, Luke,

14:47.985 --> 14:49.622
getting a shoe shine.

14:49.989 --> 14:53.196
You are a gracious
master to allow that, Tom.

14:53.229 --> 14:56.368
Though I suppose if any of that
kind deserves it, it's Luke.

14:56.401 --> 14:59.909
He is a fine tiller of the land.

15:00.409 --> 15:02.079
(Ben chuckles)

15:08.627 --> 15:11.666
(birds chirping)

15:11.699 --> 15:14.505
(water gushing)

15:23.590 --> 15:26.161
-I had Nancy take care
of they tea. -(Dana sighs)

15:27.263 --> 15:29.268
Now you can go on and get,

15:29.301 --> 15:31.371
because there ain't no
reason you got to be up in here.

15:38.419 --> 15:41.124
(exhales deeply)

15:50.343 --> 15:52.648
Maybe, uh, Rufus
shouldn't be drinking.

15:52.681 --> 15:55.320
-Why not?
-Because you're 12.

15:55.353 --> 15:58.125
Had my fair share of drink at
his age. Part of the business.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.096
Yeah, it's part of
the business, Kevin.

16:00.129 --> 16:01.666
Mmm-hmm, which part?

16:01.699 --> 16:05.339
Come on, have a drink,
Mr. Franklin. Relax.

16:06.475 --> 16:08.045
You know, I find your temperance

16:08.078 --> 16:10.584
rather feminine in
nature, to be frank.

16:10.617 --> 16:12.788
It's no wonder
you were Broadus's downfall.

16:12.821 --> 16:14.658
(Tom and Rufus laughing)

16:16.094 --> 16:20.035
I jest. I jest,
lighten up. We're celebrating.

16:20.469 --> 16:23.342
-What?
-I just made a great deal
with Benjamin.

16:23.375 --> 16:28.720
-RUFUS: What'd you do?
-Well, I had something he wanted
that I didn't need anymore.

16:32.226 --> 16:33.530
-Uh, no.
-Thank you.

16:34.164 --> 16:35.466
Thank you.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.671
(cutlery clanking)

16:39.474 --> 16:42.046
How about that, Rufus? Handsome,
don't you think?

16:42.480 --> 16:45.554
-I don't know.
-You're not looking, son.

16:47.357 --> 16:48.693
RUFUS: She's all right.

16:49.394 --> 16:53.469
Now, you see a woman like that,
you look, but you don't marry.

16:53.503 --> 16:55.774
-Why not?
-Because she's below you.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.478
RUFUS: I-- I don't
even want to get married.

16:58.846 --> 17:01.217
TOM: All men must find a wife.

17:01.585 --> 17:02.754
Kevin didn't.

17:03.121 --> 17:04.792
TOM: You don't want
to end up like Kevin.

17:04.825 --> 17:07.364
Yes, I do. Kevin has Dana.

17:07.397 --> 17:10.737
-That's not what your dad means,
Rufus. -Dana's a slave, Rufus.

17:11.271 --> 17:14.111
No, she's not. She's special.

17:14.144 --> 17:16.448
Ruf, I think you've
had too much to drink.

17:16.481 --> 17:18.753
I have not.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.628
(Rufus sighs)

17:24.498 --> 17:26.636
Yes, I quite agree.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.243
Nigel will deliver you home.

17:30.276 --> 17:32.548
-Go on, he's outside.
-(Rufus mumbling)

17:32.581 --> 17:35.787
Leave, before
you embarrass me forever.

17:43.570 --> 17:46.776
There's your quality
time between father and son.

17:47.277 --> 17:48.747
I can't say it feels right.

17:48.780 --> 17:50.416
(mug thuds)

17:50.449 --> 17:52.521
He's been coddled
by women his whole life.

17:53.222 --> 17:55.760
Should have taken
him under my wing sooner.

17:57.196 --> 17:58.800
Oh, come, Mr. Franklin.

17:59.869 --> 18:01.806
You won't waste
a drink, will you?

18:01.839 --> 18:03.810
I've been quite
generous with you.

18:06.616 --> 18:09.187
You can't toast
with an empty glass.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.458
Without it, you'll
give us both bad luck.

18:11.492 --> 18:13.863
And I think you've had
enough of that for a lifetime.

18:14.865 --> 18:16.134
Don't you agree?

18:34.471 --> 18:36.609
-(sighs)
-(mug thuds)

18:36.642 --> 18:39.180
Now drink, Mr. Franklin.

18:41.719 --> 18:42.788
(mug thuds)

18:43.890 --> 18:45.527
(Tom laughs)

18:48.767 --> 18:50.302
(mug thuds)

19:15.887 --> 19:17.792
MAY: Oh, Dana.

19:17.825 --> 19:19.227
I've been looking for you.

19:19.829 --> 19:22.968
I'm sorry for my sister.

19:23.001 --> 19:24.872
She was terribly unfair to you.

19:26.475 --> 19:29.916
I hope you find me
less formidable than Maggie.

19:29.949 --> 19:32.855
Prior to
our residence in Baltimore,

19:32.888 --> 19:35.660
my husband and I, he's a doctor,

19:36.361 --> 19:38.699
we spent time
in Boston amongst...

19:39.835 --> 19:41.539
many liberal thinkers.

19:42.107 --> 19:44.845
My sister and
I diverge in that way.

19:46.749 --> 19:49.488
How has she been? My sister?

19:49.522 --> 19:52.627
Is her unhappiness as
apparent to you as it is to me?

19:53.730 --> 19:55.667
She doesn't
really confide in me.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.771
But surely you have eyes.

19:58.239 --> 20:01.846
You can tell me.
Is Tom the source of her misery?

20:06.722 --> 20:07.791
Then tell me this.

20:09.528 --> 20:12.433
Is it true
that Tom starved his slaves

20:12.466 --> 20:14.403
after his concubine escaped?

20:19.748 --> 20:20.950
(sighs)

20:21.752 --> 20:26.428
Scarcely. Maggie
is too humiliated
to tell me such things.

20:26.461 --> 20:28.432
She knows I never liked Tom.

20:28.465 --> 20:29.769
(May chuckles)

20:29.802 --> 20:32.575
That man is
a heathen and a drunkard

20:32.608 --> 20:34.545
who can barely
spell his own name.

20:35.313 --> 20:38.485
NIGEL: Dana, can
you help me with Master Rufus?

20:41.057 --> 20:42.928
Rufus, what-- what happened?

20:42.961 --> 20:45.299
Master Rufus has had
too much whiskey, that's all.

20:46.067 --> 20:48.873
Rufus. Rufus, what's wrong?

20:49.808 --> 20:51.880
-He's drunk.
-Drunk?

20:51.913 --> 20:53.950
-RUFUS: I feel sick.
-MARGARET: Who did this?

20:53.983 --> 20:56.756
-Was it your father?
-MAY: Well, of course it
was his father.

20:56.789 --> 21:00.531
All that louse does is drink
and now your son is old enough
to join him.

21:00.564 --> 21:03.002
Is this what you want, Maggie?
For your child to grow up

21:03.035 --> 21:05.406
-to be just like
his godless father?
-Don't say that.

21:05.439 --> 21:07.745
Well, that is the course
you have put him on, Maggie.

21:07.778 --> 21:09.515
His very soul is at stake.

21:09.548 --> 21:12.487
Stop it, May, stop!
You think I don't know.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.957
MAY: This is too much.

21:13.990 --> 21:18.599
I have duties to
uphold. Obligations.

21:19.067 --> 21:22.373
It rips me in two
to see you like this.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.780
It's misery. Time
has come to do something.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.957
Please leave us
alone for a while.

21:35.567 --> 21:37.804
-RUFUS: Mama.
-Oh, honey.

21:38.840 --> 21:39.908
No.

21:41.111 --> 21:43.449
TOM: I was
thinking just this morning

21:43.482 --> 21:45.821
there's so much
I don't know about you.

21:45.854 --> 21:48.058
Your people,
where are they from?

21:49.093 --> 21:50.563
I told you, I'm from New York.

21:51.699 --> 21:52.901
But your parents?

21:54.905 --> 21:56.542
New Jersey.

21:56.575 --> 21:58.880
And they were musicians?

21:58.913 --> 22:02.955
My dad was a bookkeeper,
an accountant, a bookkeeper.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.925
Yet you have no books to keep.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.106
You know, I-- I was thinking
maybe it's a little early
for Rufus

22:12.139 --> 22:14.879
to start his planting education.

22:14.912 --> 22:17.817
Maybe stay in school a little
bit longer, don't you think?

22:18.686 --> 22:22.761
I stopped around his age. A man
only needs to know his sums.

22:22.794 --> 22:26.034
Right, but might be
good for him to spend some time

22:26.067 --> 22:28.539
around some
other boys at his age.

22:29.073 --> 22:31.111
He says he doesn't
have any friends anymore.

22:31.144 --> 22:32.715
Seems really sad to me.

22:32.748 --> 22:35.620
Well, that's what
you're for, is it not?

22:36.956 --> 22:39.126
Or are you planning on
leaving us sometime soon?

22:40.864 --> 22:43.101
-Oh, no. No, I'm not.
-TOM: You're not?

22:44.605 --> 22:46.709
Well, the show must be starting.

22:46.742 --> 22:48.580
-The show?
-TOM: Yes.

22:48.613 --> 22:50.851
I was going back and
forth as to whether it would be

22:50.884 --> 22:53.088
appropriate for
Rufus or not, but...

22:54.692 --> 22:56.094
I feel you'll enjoy it.

22:56.829 --> 22:57.998
Grab your drink.

23:03.075 --> 23:04.879
(indistinct chatter)

23:04.912 --> 23:07.885
COMMENTATOR:
Gentleman, place your bets.

23:07.918 --> 23:10.891
Place your bets,
we've got three rounds tonight,

23:10.924 --> 23:12.995
starting with the lovely Jane.

23:13.028 --> 23:15.667
-(laughter)
-Oh, Franklin.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.839
(indistinct chatter)

23:27.691 --> 23:29.594
(man coughing)

23:33.569 --> 23:34.738
(laughing)

23:37.677 --> 23:39.013
COMMENTATOR: First up is Jane.

23:39.648 --> 23:42.554
How long would the niggers
last before she is conquered?

23:42.587 --> 23:45.126
(crowd chatters)

23:45.159 --> 23:48.499
(Jane screeches)

23:50.202 --> 23:51.471
JANE: Please.

23:52.206 --> 23:53.710
MAN: Go on, get her.

23:53.743 --> 23:55.613
-(Jane thuds)
-(crowd cheers)

23:56.014 --> 23:58.185
JANE: Please,
stop. Please, stop.

23:58.218 --> 24:03.596
-(Jane pleading)
-(crowd laughing)

24:03.629 --> 24:07.771
-(crowd cheering)
-(Jane yelling)

24:17.924 --> 24:18.959
TOM: Kevin.

24:25.840 --> 24:26.943
Shall we go?

24:26.976 --> 24:29.246
(footsteps crunching)

24:38.265 --> 24:40.937
(horse blows and grunts)

24:43.074 --> 24:44.712
KEVIN: Where's Luke?

24:44.745 --> 24:46.682
TOM: He doesn't
belong to me anymore.

24:47.884 --> 24:49.955
He won't be returning with us.

24:52.994 --> 24:55.566
(muffled chatter)

25:02.012 --> 25:03.983
RUFUS: Can Dana come with us?

25:04.518 --> 25:06.254
-MARGARET: No, Rufus.
-DANA: What's going on?

25:06.287 --> 25:08.559
MARGARET: Come
on. Go back upstairs.

25:12.767 --> 25:13.836
Fuck.

25:15.940 --> 25:17.577
Jake! Jake!

25:18.345 --> 25:20.282
They're running,
they're running,
and they're taking Rufus.

25:20.684 --> 25:24.056
You gotta stop--
you gotta stop them. Come on,
they'll be gone any minute.

25:26.027 --> 25:29.769
Jake, come on. Tom left you
in charge, didn't he?

25:29.802 --> 25:32.841
Someone ought to teach you
to mind your own business.

25:34.645 --> 25:35.880
You're their cousin.

25:37.216 --> 25:39.988
-Right.
-I best get going now.

25:46.334 --> 25:47.871
MARGARET: Rufus, sit up.

25:48.940 --> 25:51.745
(heavy breathing)

25:52.848 --> 25:55.186
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, stop, stop.

25:55.219 --> 25:57.825
Get out of the way.
This is none of your concern.

25:57.858 --> 26:00.162
-You can't take him. -MAY: My
sister can do what she pleases.

26:00.195 --> 26:01.966
-DANA: Margaret.
-Do not think I will save you

26:01.999 --> 26:04.037
from being trampled if
you insist on impeding us.

26:04.070 --> 26:06.241
-DANA: Margaret, he has to
stay here. -Get out of the way.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.045
You cannot take
him. He has to stay here.

26:08.078 --> 26:10.348
And who are
you to determine that?

26:12.419 --> 26:14.792
-Hmm?
-Do you remember
when Rufus was younger

26:14.825 --> 26:16.294
and someone saved him
from being drowned?

26:17.764 --> 26:19.935
And then after that,
when there was a fire,

26:20.369 --> 26:22.640
and somehow
he was brought to safety?

26:25.379 --> 26:28.218
That was me, Margaret,
and I-- I can't explain it
to you right now,

26:28.251 --> 26:31.024
but I can promise you,
I'm here to protect him.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.228
She is raving mad.

26:37.837 --> 26:39.641
I rem-- remember.

26:40.710 --> 26:41.945
I'm here to keep him alive.

26:46.321 --> 26:47.690
And he has to stay here.

26:48.057 --> 26:50.362
The devil came
into my house one night

26:50.395 --> 26:52.099
and no one believed me.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.037
And then again by the river.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.974
How could I not see
that it was you?

26:56.007 --> 26:57.744
-No, no, Margaret.
-You're the devil.

26:57.777 --> 26:59.180
-Devil!
-DANA: I-- I'm not!

26:59.213 --> 27:01.017
-Margaret, I am not the devil.
-Be gone!

27:01.652 --> 27:04.057
-Demon. -Margaret
please, please, please, please!

27:04.090 --> 27:07.362
-You will not take him from me!
-Rufus! Rufus! Rufus!

27:08.298 --> 27:10.269
Rufus! Rufus!

27:10.302 --> 27:12.741
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:12.774 --> 27:13.843
Rufus!

27:17.016 --> 27:19.989
TOM: I wouldn't get
too sentimental about Luke.

27:20.022 --> 27:22.961
He needed to see just
how good he had it with me.

27:26.034 --> 27:28.438
-Mr. Franklin.
-KEVIN: What?

27:28.840 --> 27:31.745
TOM: You seem ill-tempered.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.989
Is it from the drink?

27:37.524 --> 27:38.959
Is this why you abstain?

27:39.460 --> 27:42.734
Or is it the entertainment
that's affecting you?

27:42.767 --> 27:44.738
I thought that you of
all people would appreciate

27:44.771 --> 27:48.177
that sort of spectacle,
considering your taste.

27:50.048 --> 27:51.885
Are you talking about Dana?

27:58.799 --> 28:00.268
So it's just as Rufus said.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.446
I know what
you're talking about.

28:05.479 --> 28:08.084
I fear that you actually are

28:08.418 --> 28:10.155
in love with your chattel.

28:12.092 --> 28:13.896
And if so, you must know

28:13.929 --> 28:16.400
that those feelings
you have, they're unnatural.

28:17.469 --> 28:21.444
-Like you're any different.
-TOM: Do not compare me to you.

28:21.477 --> 28:23.916
I would never feel
love for such creatures.

28:24.851 --> 28:26.789
It'd be a cruelty unto them.

28:26.822 --> 28:29.928
-Ah, wouldn't you?
-Wouldn't I, what?

28:29.961 --> 28:32.066
KEVIN: Seems like
you feel more than you'll admit.

28:32.099 --> 28:33.201
At least about Winnie.

28:40.516 --> 28:43.523
It seems it's time
our arrangement come to an end.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.191
Fine.

28:46.394 --> 28:48.800
Then let us tidy
our books, shall we?

28:48.833 --> 28:50.235
You owe me $10.

28:51.371 --> 28:53.275
-What?
-For the haircut,

28:53.308 --> 28:56.180
the drinks, the entertainment.

28:56.715 --> 28:59.487
-For the very
clothes on your back.
-I don't have any money, Tom.

28:59.521 --> 29:01.257
You know I don't have any money.

29:01.290 --> 29:03.796
Very well. Dismount.

29:04.463 --> 29:05.533
Tom.

29:08.405 --> 29:10.475
I said dismount.

29:18.491 --> 29:19.527
The reins.

29:24.571 --> 29:26.441
Our arrangement
is hereby terminated.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.946
Tom, I've got to
get to Dana, please.

29:29.782 --> 29:32.987
You ever step foot on my land
again and I will shoot you dead.

29:35.493 --> 29:38.832
Believe me when I tell
you I am a man of my word.

29:58.438 --> 30:00.308
-(door slams shut)
-DANA: Where's Kevin?

30:01.177 --> 30:03.849
TOM: Margaret? Where are you?

30:04.450 --> 30:06.955
(grunts) Margaret?

30:08.559 --> 30:11.632
-She's gone.
-TOM: Gone where?

30:11.665 --> 30:13.101
To Baltimore with May.

30:14.538 --> 30:15.940
They took Rufus.

30:18.411 --> 30:19.915
TOM: They did what?

30:19.948 --> 30:21.350
Christ sake.

30:23.087 --> 30:24.257
Where's Kevin?

30:24.290 --> 30:27.430
(knocking on door)

30:27.463 --> 30:30.169
-(door creaks open)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it.

30:30.202 --> 30:32.006
It's me. It's Kevin.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.375
Please tell me Dana's here.

30:33.408 --> 30:36.114
Why would
she be? What's going on?

30:36.147 --> 30:37.482
Dana's in danger.

30:42.961 --> 30:44.296
(door creaks)

30:46.367 --> 30:48.539
She's trapped with
Tom on the plantation

30:48.572 --> 30:50.944
and I can't go back
there or he'll kill me.

30:50.977 --> 30:53.348
-What did you do?
-Not my-- it's not my fault.

30:53.381 --> 30:54.450
It's not-- I'm--

30:56.187 --> 30:58.559
Tom and I got into an argument,
he pulled a gun on me.

30:58.592 --> 31:00.261
Please, someone has
to get her out of there.

31:01.498 --> 31:03.401
I'll find Luke. He'll help.

31:04.470 --> 31:06.440
He can't, Tom sold him.

31:08.111 --> 31:10.248
-He what?
-KEVIN: Earlier today in Easton.

31:17.630 --> 31:19.601
OLIVIA: It's gonna be
hard for me to get Dana.

31:20.335 --> 31:23.375
Tom will know enough
to search for her here.

31:23.408 --> 31:25.044
He's seen us together.

31:25.679 --> 31:27.483
We have no choice but to leave.

31:27.517 --> 31:29.521
Leave and go where?

31:29.554 --> 31:32.092
North. Philadelphia.

31:34.363 --> 31:36.066
Sooner than I planned.

31:36.568 --> 31:38.371
Alice, pack your bag.

31:38.404 --> 31:39.607
We're gonna have to flee.

31:40.676 --> 31:41.945
Okay?

31:47.489 --> 31:50.963
You stay here.
I don't want you getting
into any more trouble.

31:53.569 --> 31:55.072
(door creaks open)

31:55.105 --> 31:56.641
TOM: I don't
care how late it is.

31:57.008 --> 32:00.215
So you get out there and you
find him and you bring him back

32:00.248 --> 32:02.352
right fucking now.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.227
-JAKE: What about Margaret?
-TOM: Leave her.

32:08.666 --> 32:10.637
JAKE: Nosy bitch.

32:10.670 --> 32:12.674
What are
you doing standing there?

32:12.707 --> 32:14.209
It's all right, Jake.

32:16.047 --> 32:17.182
Let her come in here.

32:26.602 --> 32:28.070
(door slams shut)

32:35.051 --> 32:36.688
DANA: Where is Mr. Franklin?

32:38.491 --> 32:40.094
(Tom grunts)

32:40.529 --> 32:43.101
What an odd thing you are.

32:43.134 --> 32:45.372
-How old are you?
-Twenty-six.

32:45.405 --> 32:48.277
You've been with
a child before, yes?

32:56.227 --> 32:59.399
What do you think of
Mr. Franklin as a master?

33:00.301 --> 33:04.745
-Excuse me?
-TOM: Well, you must
tire of his instability.

33:04.778 --> 33:08.719
A master without a home,
that's kind of funny, isn't it?

33:10.523 --> 33:13.562
How would you like
to stay here permanently?

33:14.764 --> 33:18.037
Rufus seems to like you too.

33:18.672 --> 33:22.079
And you would
continue on as his companion.

33:22.112 --> 33:24.551
And you'd live here

33:24.584 --> 33:28.057
instead of being dragged around
the country by a traveling
minstrel.

33:30.796 --> 33:32.332
What say you?

33:33.535 --> 33:34.737
Would you like that?

33:36.808 --> 33:38.210
No, sir.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.852
I belong to Mr. Franklin.

33:41.885 --> 33:43.220
Where is he?

33:44.624 --> 33:46.561
I don't know. Stop asking.

33:48.799 --> 33:50.335
What do you mean,
you don't know?

33:50.368 --> 33:52.339
I mean that I don't know.

33:53.676 --> 33:56.247
-(thud)
-Did you do something to him?

33:56.280 --> 33:59.655
He'll return when he returns.

33:59.688 --> 34:05.198
Or maybe he won't.
And fool you are to expect
anything else from that louse.

34:05.231 --> 34:06.367
(Tom chuckles)

34:08.304 --> 34:09.641
(Tom laughs)

34:16.855 --> 34:19.359
You really are
a loyal breed, aren't you?

34:19.761 --> 34:21.498
Do you even know
what's good for you?

34:22.232 --> 34:23.769
(Tom coughs)

34:24.804 --> 34:26.574
(grunts) Leave my sight.

34:32.152 --> 34:33.220
(door creaks)

34:38.866 --> 34:41.705
-(banging on door)
-WOMAN: Hello.

34:41.738 --> 34:43.407
-(banging on door)
-Don't open that.

34:45.746 --> 34:48.484
(banging on door)

34:54.196 --> 34:56.167
-Mr. Franklin.
-Oh, my God.

34:56.200 --> 34:58.539
-Winnie, you're still here?
-Don't let her out.

34:58.572 --> 35:01.244
I was just hoping

35:01.277 --> 35:03.615
I could stretch my
legs for a little bit.

35:07.222 --> 35:08.290
KEVIN: Yeah.

35:11.363 --> 35:13.869
(Winnie sighs)

35:13.902 --> 35:15.506
Are you-- are you okay?

35:15.940 --> 35:19.146
(exhales deeply)
May I have a glass of water?

35:20.783 --> 35:22.720
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure.

35:35.579 --> 35:36.648
KEVIN: You okay?

35:40.589 --> 35:42.325
Holy shit.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.900
-You have to go get her.
-KEVIN: Shit, shit, shit.

35:45.933 --> 35:47.202
Winnie!

35:50.408 --> 35:52.312
-(door clicks open)
-Kevin.

35:55.619 --> 35:56.888
Sarah.

35:57.657 --> 36:01.732
-What are you doing here?
-Massa Tom wanted me
to bring you some food.

36:01.765 --> 36:04.469
-I'm not hungry. -You really
ought to eat something.

36:05.471 --> 36:08.378
Why are you here? I thought you
never stepped foot in the house.

36:08.411 --> 36:10.215
The reason I never
stepped foot in this house

36:10.248 --> 36:11.885
don't seem to
be a reason no more.

36:13.689 --> 36:15.291
Because of Margaret?

36:21.571 --> 36:25.244
-Where's Luke?
-He didn't come back neither.

36:26.715 --> 36:28.017
Is he with Kevin?

36:28.050 --> 36:30.856
SARAH: No child, he gone.

36:31.992 --> 36:33.227
So...

36:34.096 --> 36:36.433
see Luke never cared
about keeping the peace.

36:36.801 --> 36:38.939
I told you he was always doing

36:38.972 --> 36:41.310
exactly what
he wanted when he wanted.

36:42.445 --> 36:43.515
Serves him right.

36:44.684 --> 36:46.320
I don't know
where your Massa is...

36:47.156 --> 36:50.261
but it sound like he ticked
Marse Tom off something fierce.

36:51.330 --> 36:54.303
Now, I would imagine that he's
gonna be risking his life

36:54.336 --> 36:55.639
to come back
around here for you.

36:56.741 --> 36:58.311
What do you mean by that?

36:58.344 --> 37:00.348
KEVIN: No, no,
no, no, no, Winnie!

37:00.883 --> 37:01.918
Winnie!

37:03.487 --> 37:04.757
Winnie!

37:06.595 --> 37:08.799
Massa Tom own you now.
