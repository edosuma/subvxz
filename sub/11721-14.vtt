01:42.409 --> 01:44.765
Hey.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.170
Morning.

01:47.172 --> 01:48.571
Morning.

01:54.679 --> 01:56.145
Hey,

01:56.147 --> 01:59.315
you know what today is?
No.

02:00.185 --> 02:02.085
Think back, one year ago.

02:03.855 --> 02:06.122
Vancouver.

02:07.292 --> 02:09.792
I found you in that diner.

02:11.796 --> 02:13.429
That feels like a lifetime ago.

02:13.431 --> 02:15.164
You know,
after we got home,

02:15.166 --> 02:17.166
those first few weeks
were an adjustment.

02:17.168 --> 02:20.470
Not having to look
over my shoulder anymore.

02:20.472 --> 02:24.741
But slowly, life got back
to normal, and...

02:24.743 --> 02:27.377
I started thinking
about the future and...

02:27.379 --> 02:29.645
where we'd be in a year.

02:34.018 --> 02:37.720
I thought for certain...
we'd be married.

02:37.722 --> 02:40.390
Um...
Hey, look, I made a promise to you.

02:40.392 --> 02:41.891
I said you
wouldn't lose me,

02:41.893 --> 02:43.526
and you haven't.

02:43.528 --> 02:44.927
Here I am.

02:44.929 --> 02:46.562
Everything is good, so...

02:46.564 --> 02:47.997
what's the problem?

02:47.999 --> 02:50.266
Nothing.
There's no problem.

02:50.268 --> 02:53.403
Everything is just
so good right now.

02:53.405 --> 02:54.737
I don't want it to change.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.973
That's not it.

03:06.518 --> 03:08.751
It's your father's company.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.052
I'm sorry?

03:11.289 --> 03:14.190
Look, I know
you've worked so hard

03:14.192 --> 03:16.392
to clean up the business...

03:16.394 --> 03:18.327
but there are still a few things

03:18.329 --> 03:20.229
about it that I have
a problem with.

03:20.231 --> 03:21.564
Kono, I...

03:21.566 --> 03:22.732
Adam, just...

03:22.734 --> 03:25.601
Look, it still has ties
to the Noshimuri clan,

03:25.603 --> 03:27.937
investors who were once
connected to the Yakuza.

03:27.939 --> 03:29.172
Up until a few months ago,

03:29.174 --> 03:30.907
Wo Fat had a stake
in the company.

03:30.909 --> 03:33.242
I had no knowledge of that.
Look, I know that.

03:33.244 --> 03:35.711
Every day, I fight
to keep our holdings legit,

03:35.713 --> 03:37.409
to make sure the business
doesn't go back to what it was

03:37.433 --> 03:38.437
Okay, but still,

03:38.438 --> 03:41.105
the money that your father
used to build the company,

03:41.107 --> 03:43.307
where that came from...

03:43.309 --> 03:45.543
Adam, no matter what you do,

03:45.545 --> 03:48.446
it's a business that was born
out of corruption.

03:48.448 --> 03:52.583
And as long as you're
tied to it...

03:55.321 --> 03:58.656
You want me to sell the company.

04:01.161 --> 04:05.897
Have I ever asked you
to quit being a cop?

04:05.899 --> 04:07.699
Every second of the day,

04:07.701 --> 04:10.068
I worry about you,
but have I ever asked you

04:10.070 --> 04:11.269
to give up your job?

04:11.271 --> 04:13.037
No.

04:13.039 --> 04:15.273
But now you're asking me
to give up mine.

04:16.209 --> 04:18.076
Kono, I am fighting

04:18.077 --> 04:20.244
to change my family's legacy.

04:20.245 --> 04:23.214
I walk away now,
that will never happen.

04:23.216 --> 04:25.650
And let's say I do sell, okay?
What then?

04:25.652 --> 04:28.086
Wh-What do you expect me
to do with my life?

04:28.088 --> 04:30.455
Look, I don't know, but we
could figure it out.

04:30.457 --> 04:32.557
Yeah... right.
We'll figure it out.

04:32.559 --> 04:34.292
Like it's no big deal.

04:35.462 --> 04:38.896
Maybe you're not in a place
you can hear me right now.

04:43.036 --> 04:45.203
I should go.

04:58.838 --> 05:00.834
So, the doctor says
Dekker's gonna pull through.

05:00.835 --> 05:02.134
Lucky, though.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.969
Close-contact GSW
to the gut.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.072
Not to mention the one he took
trying to hop the fence,

05:07.074 --> 05:08.941
on top of the beating
that he took.

05:08.943 --> 05:10.442
All told, the guy suffered
heavy blood loss,

05:10.444 --> 05:11.977
a little head trauma.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.445
And when did this guy
even get out of prison?

05:13.447 --> 05:14.847
Three days ago.

05:14.849 --> 05:16.982
Apparently, his release
was under a court order.

05:16.984 --> 05:17.950
They kept it very quiet.

05:17.952 --> 05:19.118
All right, thanks.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.619
Okay, so, HPD ran the car
Dekker was driving--

05:20.621 --> 05:22.521
no VIN number,
plates were stolen,

05:22.523 --> 05:24.490
lab's processing it now.
All right, fine.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.192
What about the slug from
the first GSW-- we recover that?

05:27.194 --> 05:29.161
Nothing.
Through-and-through.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.897
All right, I don't get it.
Dekker still had six years left

05:31.899 --> 05:34.566
on his sentence, now, all of
a sudden, he's a free man?

05:34.568 --> 05:36.402
Well, maybe he finally
snitched his way out.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.636
I think
the bigger mystery

05:37.638 --> 05:39.338
is why he was trying
to get back in.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.607
I've heard of cons who
want to go back to prison,

05:41.609 --> 05:43.275
but actually attempting
to break in?

05:43.277 --> 05:44.788
No precedent for that.

05:44.813 --> 05:46.212
I think we're about to get
some answers.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.846
Hey, who is that?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.047
He's with ICE--

05:49.049 --> 05:51.383
he worked a homicide with us
a few years back.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.585
Hey. Commander.
Agent Morrison.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.720
How's he doing?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.054
He'll live.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.589
Has he spoken yet?

05:57.591 --> 05:59.091
No. Maybe
you could tell us

05:59.093 --> 06:00.759
what's going on here.

06:02.897 --> 06:04.263
All right, look,
Dekker's my CI.

06:04.265 --> 06:06.799
We got him out of Halawa to
help us with a major operation.

06:06.801 --> 06:10.202
Lost contact last night, and we've
been looking for him ever since.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.437
What was the op?

06:12.640 --> 06:15.374
We're after a high-value target:
Roman Zednick.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.975
Bulgarian.
He's into everything

06:16.977 --> 06:18.310
from narcotrafficking

06:18.312 --> 06:20.045
and K&R to assassination
and piracy.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.146
Diversified.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.581
This the best
picture you got?

06:22.583 --> 06:23.949
This is the <i> only</i> picture
that we got.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.421
It was taken in Madrid
three weeks ago.

06:25.421 --> 06:27.820
Man obviously knows
how to keep a low profile.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.087
He excels at it.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.489
Hardly anyone has ever

06:30.491 --> 06:32.458
laid eyes on Roman--
up until recently we thought

06:32.460 --> 06:34.593
maybe he was just a myth.
Turns out he's been operating

06:34.595 --> 06:36.528
in the shadows for years,
mainly in Eastern Europe.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.832
He is bold, he is smart,
he is ruthless, and from what

06:39.834 --> 06:42.701
we understand, he wants
to plant his flag in the U.S.

06:42.703 --> 06:43.988
We'll do whatever it takes
to stop him.

06:43.989 --> 06:44.909
How did Dekker fit in?

06:44.933 --> 06:46.933
So, five days ago,
we get Intel that

06:47.074 --> 06:48.941
Roman's on the Island
and he wants to buy weapons.

06:48.943 --> 06:50.203
Soon as we heard that, we
knew we had an opening--

06:50.227 --> 06:51.578
great opportunity to get

06:51.579 --> 06:52.978
someone close to Roman
to I.D. him.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.446
Right, you just need
a weapons broker.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.781
Exactly.
So enter J.C. Dekker.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.350
We move as quickly as we can,
we get him out of Halawa

06:58.352 --> 06:59.852
on a trumped-up
legal technicality,

06:59.854 --> 07:01.186
falsify the court records,

07:01.188 --> 07:03.121
create a paper trail
that goes back for months.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.257
Soon as he's free,
Dekker used his contacts

07:05.259 --> 07:07.292
to set up a one-on-one
with Roman.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.928
We went to the meet last night,
but we lost visual.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.463
We believe that Roman's
people grabbed Dekker

07:11.465 --> 07:14.066
to take him to a second location to
meet the man himself.

07:14.068 --> 07:16.068
I can only assume that,
at some point,

07:16.070 --> 07:18.670
Dekker was compromised
and they tried to take him out.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.572
Excuse me-- Mr. Dekker
has regained consciousness.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.107
I want
to talk to him.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.642
I don't think
that's a good idea.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.110
The patient's a bit hostile
at the moment.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.446
I don't care-- I still
want to speak with him.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.248
Well, the thing is, Mr. Dekker's
insisting on only speaking

07:29.250 --> 07:31.183
to members
of the Five-O task force,

07:31.185 --> 07:32.684
no one else.

07:35.256 --> 07:38.023
Hey, before
you even start in,

07:38.025 --> 07:40.492
straight up,
I don't know what's going on,

07:40.494 --> 07:41.593
but I could tell you

07:41.595 --> 07:43.362
I did <i> not</i> break out of Halawa.

07:43.364 --> 07:44.630
Just relax, all right?

07:44.632 --> 07:45.697
We know all about ICE.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.900
ICE?

07:47.902 --> 07:49.001
What are you talking about?

07:49.003 --> 07:50.936
Look, I don't know
what happened,

07:50.938 --> 07:52.304
but one minute
I'm working laundry,

07:52.306 --> 07:53.438
the next I'm in here,

07:53.440 --> 07:56.008
and they tell me
I got shot outside the prison.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.243
Wait a minute,
the last thing

07:58.245 --> 07:59.978
you remember is working laundry?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.113
Yeah.

08:01.115 --> 08:02.648
So you're saying

08:02.650 --> 08:03.815
that everything
that happened

08:03.817 --> 08:05.350
over the past three days--
Roman,

08:05.352 --> 08:07.219
the guns, the op--

08:07.221 --> 08:08.353
you don't remember
any of that?

08:08.355 --> 08:09.521
Three days?

08:09.523 --> 08:11.423
What the hell
are you talking about?

08:11.425 --> 08:13.358
What op?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.227
Who's Roman?

08:15.229 --> 08:17.296
What the hell's
going on here?

08:27.401 --> 08:29.701
The one guy who can I.D.
our number-one most wanted,

08:29.703 --> 08:32.104
and he says
he can't remember?

08:32.106 --> 08:33.071
Steve, do you believe him?

08:33.073 --> 08:35.140
Well, the doctors
told Chin and I

08:35.142 --> 08:36.341
that based on
the head trauma

08:36.342 --> 08:37.609
Dekker sustained,

08:37.611 --> 08:39.678
this type of amnesia
is possible.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.746
But we're talking
about J.C. Dekker here.

08:41.749 --> 08:44.485
This guy's been lying to the
cops since before he could dress himself.

08:44.486 --> 08:45.751
You're thinking
this is a ploy?

08:45.753 --> 08:46.952
I'm just saying,

08:46.954 --> 08:48.620
how do we know he's
not working an angle?

08:48.622 --> 08:50.555
What if he doesn't want
to say what happened

08:50.557 --> 08:52.858
- because he's afraid of Roman?
- I don't know. I mean,

08:52.860 --> 08:54.126
the last time we
talked to Dekker,

08:54.128 --> 08:55.427
he seemed
like a changed man.

08:55.429 --> 08:56.895
Plus, the amnesia would explain

08:56.897 --> 08:58.597
him trying to break
back into Halawa.

08:58.599 --> 08:59.898
Yeah, he's
confused, disoriented.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.833
He doesn't know
why he's not locked up.

09:01.835 --> 09:03.201
Well, here's the bad news:

09:03.203 --> 09:04.569
There is no test
to determine

09:04.571 --> 09:07.205
if you really have amnesia,
so we got no way of knowing

09:07.207 --> 09:08.540
if the guy's
telling the truth.

09:08.542 --> 09:10.542
- What about a polygraph?
- We could try,

09:10.544 --> 09:12.210
but I'm afraid the meds
in Dekker's system

09:12.212 --> 09:13.278
would skew the results.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.913
However, there
may actually be

09:14.915 --> 09:16.615
another way.

09:23.123 --> 09:25.057
Afternoon.

09:26.126 --> 09:28.293
How we feeling?

09:28.295 --> 09:30.028
I've been shot.

09:30.030 --> 09:31.296
Twice.

09:31.298 --> 09:33.498
How you think I feel?

09:35.436 --> 09:38.103
All right, look right here.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.376
All right, I'm
gonna ask you some questions.

09:44.378 --> 09:46.011
Okay.

09:46.013 --> 09:48.413
What's the last thing you
remember before you were shot?

09:48.415 --> 09:49.648
It's Adam.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.183
Not gonna answer it?

09:51.185 --> 09:52.317
No.

09:52.319 --> 09:54.886
Tell me your name.

09:56.590 --> 09:59.358
You really don't know
who I am, do you?

09:59.360 --> 10:01.360
Aren't you my doctor?

10:18.879 --> 10:21.046
I looked right into his eyes
and he didn't recognize me.

10:21.048 --> 10:22.214
Eight months.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.449
Eight...

10:24.451 --> 10:26.418
months I have
been hunting Roman.

10:26.420 --> 10:28.787
No one has ever gotten this close to him,
and now that I have

10:28.789 --> 10:30.856
he's going back under,
and probably for good.

10:30.858 --> 10:31.923
Maybe there's a chance

10:31.925 --> 10:33.892
to catch him before
that happens, all right?

10:33.894 --> 10:35.894
We work together,
we retrace Dekker's steps,

10:35.896 --> 10:37.162
maybe it leads us
to Roman.

10:37.164 --> 10:39.231
I hate to throw
cold water, but if we're

10:39.233 --> 10:41.333
going after this guy Roman,
we got to move fast.

10:41.335 --> 10:44.069
If Dekker did see Roman, he's
gonna get the hell out of Dodge.

10:44.071 --> 10:45.637
Absolutely.
There's no question that Roman

10:45.639 --> 10:47.606
is already making plans
to get off the Island.

10:47.608 --> 10:49.541
We need to delay him.
Okay. How?

10:49.543 --> 10:50.976
We kill Dekker.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.047
We put a story out there
saying we found Dekker murdered,

10:56.049 --> 10:57.783
no suspects, no leads.

10:57.785 --> 10:59.918
If Roman doesn't think
he's been compromised,

10:59.920 --> 11:01.319
there's no reason for him
to go underground.

11:01.321 --> 11:02.387
He's here to do
business, right?

11:02.389 --> 11:03.722
He'll do his business,
and just get

11:03.724 --> 11:05.557
his guns someplace else.
Right. Then we keep him in play

11:05.559 --> 11:06.958
long enough to find him.
That's right.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.894
All right, I'll have HPD
issue a bulletin on Dekker.

11:08.896 --> 11:10.829
We need to clear
this wing out, as well.

11:10.831 --> 11:12.264
Even though
there's security up here,

11:12.266 --> 11:13.466
there's a lot of foot traffic.

11:13.467 --> 11:14.766
Less people that see
Dekker, the better.

11:14.768 --> 11:16.435
There's another
prison ward

11:16.437 --> 11:17.569
at King's Medical.

11:17.571 --> 11:18.537
We can have the guards
transfer everyone there.

11:18.539 --> 11:19.638
Yeah, I can
get a guy down here

11:19.640 --> 11:21.339
to handle security.
Oh, that's good.

11:21.341 --> 11:22.541
Listen, Kono, I want
you to stay here, too.

11:22.543 --> 11:23.642
Stay with Dekker, all right?
Work with him.

11:23.644 --> 11:25.110
See if you can help him

11:25.112 --> 11:26.611
remember the last 24 hours.
Yeah.

11:26.613 --> 11:28.246
You and me-- we're gonna go
see Dekker's boy-- the one

11:28.248 --> 11:30.215
who he reached out to to put
him in contact with Roman.

11:30.217 --> 11:31.616
That would be a gentleman
by the name of Odell Martin.

11:31.618 --> 11:33.298
All right. You know where to find him?
Yup.

11:33.854 --> 11:36.688
♪ ♪

11:42.396 --> 11:44.229
What's Dekker's
connection to this guy?

11:44.231 --> 11:46.097
They used to surf
dawn patrol together.

11:46.099 --> 11:48.533
Before that, Odell was a
player back in New York.

11:48.535 --> 11:49.968
Bookmaking,
cigarettes, weed.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.070
Comes out here ten
years ago to go legit.

11:52.072 --> 11:54.406
Dekker says he's still got
his ear to the ground,

11:54.408 --> 11:55.907
knows a lot of
underworld types.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.248
Thanks, bro.
Take care.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.083
Odell Martin?
He is me.

12:05.085 --> 12:06.351
Agent Morrison.

12:06.353 --> 12:07.552
I'm with ICE.
Commander McGarrett, Five-O.

12:07.554 --> 12:08.520
We need a word.

12:08.522 --> 12:10.388
It's gonna have
to be a quick one.

12:10.390 --> 12:11.857
Breaks just hit
four feet overhead.

12:11.859 --> 12:14.092
Anything over two,
I close up for the day.

12:14.094 --> 12:15.560
I'm pretty sure

12:15.562 --> 12:17.496
you can spare us
a couple of minutes.

12:17.498 --> 12:18.830
Ocean's not

12:18.832 --> 12:20.098
going anywhere.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.234
What can I do for you two
fine public servants?

12:22.236 --> 12:25.003
We want to ask you
about J.C. Dekker.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.572
J.C. Dekker?
I don't know no J.C. Dekker.

12:34.047 --> 12:35.480
Well, that's a strong reaction
for a guy

12:35.482 --> 12:37.315
you don't know.

12:37.317 --> 12:40.185
Odell, we...

12:40.187 --> 12:42.654
Odell?

12:42.656 --> 12:43.788
What just happened?

12:43.790 --> 12:45.590
I was saying a prayer
to Kanaloa.

12:45.592 --> 12:46.658
God of the ocean.

12:46.660 --> 12:48.727
Ah.
What happened?

12:48.729 --> 12:50.262
That's what we
want to find out.

12:50.264 --> 12:51.630
We think Roman Zednick
is involved.

12:51.632 --> 12:54.065
Yeah, see, we know
that Dekker wanted to sell

12:54.067 --> 12:55.600
Roman some weapons,
and we also know

12:55.602 --> 12:56.601
that you made
an introduction,

12:56.603 --> 12:57.869
so, we're kind of hoping
you can

12:57.871 --> 12:59.204
tell us where he is.

13:00.541 --> 13:02.908
Get in the chair.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.743
Excuse me?
Can't have people

13:04.745 --> 13:06.144
looking in here
thinking I'm a snitch.

13:06.146 --> 13:07.345
You sit in the chair,

13:07.347 --> 13:10.181
you get a trim,
you look like a customer.

13:10.183 --> 13:11.683
Don't worry.
I got lots of experience.

13:11.685 --> 13:14.319
Yeah, I bet.

13:16.323 --> 13:18.189
Hey, don't touch my sideburns.

13:18.191 --> 13:19.291
Of course not.

13:19.293 --> 13:20.392
Okay. I'm serious.

13:20.394 --> 13:21.426
Okay, look,

13:21.428 --> 13:23.028
I don't know how

13:23.030 --> 13:24.262
to get to Roman, all right?

13:24.264 --> 13:26.598
I'm connected, but I
ain't that connected.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.667
And Roman, you know, you
don't reach out to him.

13:28.669 --> 13:30.035
He reaches out to you.

13:30.037 --> 13:31.970
Well, then, how did you put
Dekker in business with him?

13:31.972 --> 13:34.406
You guys know Sidney Ames?
No, I don't.

13:34.408 --> 13:35.574
You know him?
No.

13:35.576 --> 13:37.075
Okay, how do I explain this?

13:37.077 --> 13:39.511
Think of him like a concierge
for criminals, right?

13:39.513 --> 13:41.846
You're a bad guy, you come
to town, Ames can hook you up

13:41.848 --> 13:43.181
with whatever you need--

13:43.183 --> 13:45.850
weapons, muscle,
safe house, body disposal.

13:45.852 --> 13:47.686
Man's got the island wired.

13:47.688 --> 13:50.388
He's the go-to guy for
all your illicit needs.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.324
So, word is,
Roman's using Ames

13:52.326 --> 13:54.726
to help him to do business
while he's on Oahu.

13:54.728 --> 13:57.262
All right, so you tell Ames
you got this guy Dekker

13:57.264 --> 13:58.830
who's looking to move
a little hardware.

13:58.832 --> 14:00.065
Right, and Ames said

14:00.067 --> 14:02.067
he just happened to have
a client who was in the market

14:02.069 --> 14:03.335
for a little firepower,

14:03.337 --> 14:05.403
so I told Ames where to find
Dekks, and that was that.

14:05.405 --> 14:06.405
Where do we find Ames?

14:06.406 --> 14:07.572
Wait a couple of weeks,

14:07.574 --> 14:09.541
he'll be sitting
in this very chair.

14:09.543 --> 14:12.210
Comes in once a month
for a cut and a shave.

14:12.212 --> 14:13.511
Likes the number-four clippers,
a little Brylcreem.

14:14.748 --> 14:16.281
Old school.

14:16.283 --> 14:17.449
What if we don't have
a couple of weeks?

14:17.451 --> 14:19.317
Can't help you out then.

14:19.319 --> 14:22.587
I don't keep no Rolodex,

14:22.589 --> 14:25.256
Ames only pays
with cash, so...

14:25.258 --> 14:26.958
If it's gonna help you

14:26.960 --> 14:29.361
find out who killed Dekks,
I'll ask around.

14:31.698 --> 14:33.732
That'll be ten bucks.
Whoa.

14:33.734 --> 14:38.136
This is a legitimate
transaction.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.571
You understand?

14:39.573 --> 14:41.006
Ten bucks.

14:41.008 --> 14:43.308
Keep up appearances.

14:43.310 --> 14:45.176
Getting fleeced here.

14:45.178 --> 14:46.845
Yeah, should arrest you
for that.

14:46.847 --> 14:49.581
Here you go.
Keep the change, huh?

14:51.585 --> 14:52.717
I just ran Ames.

14:52.719 --> 14:54.352
He's a slippery
son of a bitch.

14:54.354 --> 14:56.955
The guy's been arrested
three times, never charged.

14:56.957 --> 14:57.989
Current whereabouts,
unknown.

14:57.991 --> 14:59.691
Last known address
we had for the guy

14:59.693 --> 15:01.660
turned out
to be a vacant house.

15:01.662 --> 15:03.328
What about financials?
Nothing.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.896
His last known associates--
hopefully,

15:04.898 --> 15:07.365
one of 'em will be able to
tell us where to find this guy.

15:07.367 --> 15:09.601
In the meantime, have Kono
show Dekker a picture of Ames.

15:09.603 --> 15:11.670
All right? Maybe we can
help jog his memory.

15:12.539 --> 15:14.472
You said his name was Ames?

15:14.474 --> 15:15.940
We think he facilitated
your introduction

15:15.942 --> 15:17.575
to Roman.

15:20.881 --> 15:22.147
<i>Inside.</i>

15:26.186 --> 15:29.454
You want to meet
Roman, get in.

15:42.736 --> 15:45.704
I understand you have
some weapons to sell.

15:45.706 --> 15:47.038
<i>Man's voice</i>

15:47.040 --> 15:49.808
was definitely not from around here.
Mainland?

15:49.810 --> 15:52.644
Europe.

15:52.646 --> 15:54.713
Okay. What about his face?

15:54.715 --> 15:58.650
Trying to picture him.

15:58.652 --> 16:00.685
Trying to, but...

16:00.687 --> 16:02.087
it's just bits and pieces.

16:02.089 --> 16:04.889
You think I wouldn't find out?!

16:06.393 --> 16:07.959
You played us!

16:10.697 --> 16:13.098
It's all I remember.

16:13.100 --> 16:16.301
Okay, so, a faceless man
with a foreign accent

16:16.303 --> 16:18.470
in a big house
by the water.

16:18.472 --> 16:20.739
It's a start, right?

16:35.859 --> 16:38.359
<i>So, you said earlier,</i>
<i>you've been after Roman</i>

16:38.361 --> 16:40.328
for the last eight months.
You spend that whole time overseas?

16:40.330 --> 16:41.696
Yeah, most of it.

16:41.698 --> 16:43.531
Can't have been easy.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.934
No. But...

16:45.936 --> 16:47.368
certainly harder on my wife.

16:47.370 --> 16:49.337
Wrangling two kids
by herself.

16:49.339 --> 16:51.039
It was almost like
she was a single parent.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.573
Speaking of single parents,

16:52.575 --> 16:54.642
I haven't seen
Detective Williams at all.

16:54.644 --> 16:55.944
Oh, yeah, Danny's on a plane

16:55.946 --> 16:58.179
to Newark at the moment.
An old case he worked

16:58.181 --> 17:00.715
came up for appeal, he had
to go back and testify.

17:00.717 --> 17:03.251
- Yeah, Chin, what do you got?
- The lab just finished

17:03.253 --> 17:04.953
processing the car
that Dekker was in.

17:04.954 --> 17:06.654
They found fresh dirt
on the tires

17:06.656 --> 17:08.856
with traces of arsenic,
lead and methyl chloride.

17:08.858 --> 17:10.525
And, apparently,
there's only one place

17:10.527 --> 17:12.527
that has those specific toxins
in the soil,

17:12.529 --> 17:15.029
and that's the old municipal
ash dump on Sand Island.

17:15.031 --> 17:17.198
So that was the last place
Dekker was

17:17.200 --> 17:19.467
- before he showed up at Halawa?
- That's right.

17:19.469 --> 17:21.169
Considering how remote
that location is,

17:21.171 --> 17:23.503
there's only one reason
why they'd be out there.

17:23.506 --> 17:25.573
They took him out
there to kill him.

17:25.575 --> 17:26.907
My guys did a grid search.

17:26.910 --> 17:28.576
Turned up a couple
of shell casings,

17:28.578 --> 17:30.378
but this was the
real discovery.

17:30.380 --> 17:33.014
Guess we can stop
looking for Sidney Ames.

17:33.016 --> 17:35.249
All right, so, looks like
he was shot at close range.

17:35.251 --> 17:38.987
Defensive wounds on the hands,
two sets of footprints.

17:38.989 --> 17:41.723
I'm guessing Ames brought Dekker
here to kill him.

17:42.726 --> 17:44.392
<i>Dekker flipped the script,</i>

17:44.394 --> 17:46.461
<i>they struggled.</i>

17:46.463 --> 17:48.930
<i>Still got shot, but he managed</i>
<i>to get the gun away, and then,</i>

17:48.932 --> 17:52.033
<i>Dekker-- he turns around</i>
<i>and kills Ames.</i>

17:52.035 --> 17:53.634
Dekker fell on these rocks.

17:53.636 --> 17:55.036
That would explain
his head trauma.

17:55.038 --> 17:56.971
Listen, Duke, we're gonna
need to keep this quiet,

17:56.973 --> 17:58.106
what happened here.

17:58.108 --> 17:59.607
He's right.
Word gets out

17:59.609 --> 18:01.976
that Ames is dead, Roman's gonna
assume that Dekker got away.

18:01.978 --> 18:03.596
Well, we got another problem
now, though.

18:03.597 --> 18:06.631
This was the only guy
who could lead us to Roman.

18:06.633 --> 18:08.032
Unless...

18:08.034 --> 18:10.001
Here we go. We can have

18:10.003 --> 18:13.605
the service provider pull CSLI
on the phone's location history.

18:13.607 --> 18:15.540
Once we do that,
we can get a fix

18:15.542 --> 18:17.108
on the house where
Dekker met Roman.

18:17.110 --> 18:18.576
We know who lives here?

18:18.578 --> 18:20.111
No one.

18:20.113 --> 18:22.313
It's a rental
that goes for 60K a month.

18:22.315 --> 18:24.682
According to the company who
manages it, the people inside

18:24.684 --> 18:26.718
booked it for a week
and paid cash upfront.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.919
Okay, guys,

18:27.921 --> 18:29.120
we're live.

18:29.122 --> 18:30.855
I count five heat signatures

18:30.857 --> 18:32.757
in the house-- two
on the ground floor.

18:32.759 --> 18:35.193
Looks like we're about
to get a peek at one of them.

18:45.105 --> 18:46.871
All right, let's move.

19:16.770 --> 19:17.936
I got next game.

19:17.938 --> 19:19.037
Keep your hands

19:19.039 --> 19:20.605
where we can see 'em,
get on the floor.

19:20.607 --> 19:22.840
Do it slowly.

19:34.588 --> 19:37.889
Got three tangos down.

19:37.891 --> 19:39.123
Copy.

19:39.125 --> 19:41.392
Find the other two.

20:10.256 --> 20:12.256
Please... help me.

20:15.328 --> 20:16.394
Chin, call EMS.

20:18.632 --> 20:20.064
This is Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly.

20:20.066 --> 20:20.809
I need an ambulance
at 2121 Kahaleo Avenue.

20:20.809 --> 20:22.256
What's your name?
What are you doing here?

20:22.257 --> 20:23.535
Danielle.

20:23.536 --> 20:26.537
Nicolai invited me.

20:26.539 --> 20:28.172
Lindsey, my girlfriend and I--

20:28.174 --> 20:32.110
we met him last night
in Chinatown in a club.

20:32.112 --> 20:33.177
Okay. Where's Lindsey now?

20:33.179 --> 20:35.113
She-she... she left.

20:35.115 --> 20:37.382
She... she had a
plane to catch.

20:38.752 --> 20:40.284
Am I going to be okay?

20:40.286 --> 20:41.653
You're gonna be fine.

20:41.655 --> 20:43.821
You're gonna be...
you're gonna be fine.

20:43.823 --> 20:46.090
Okay.

20:56.770 --> 20:58.936
Your gun and radio.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.274
Uh-uh.

21:03.276 --> 21:04.509
Eyes forward.

21:04.511 --> 21:06.310
There is no way out of here.

21:06.312 --> 21:08.413
Oh, I disagree.

21:08.415 --> 21:11.449
You are going to get me out,
Agent Morrison.

21:11.451 --> 21:12.717
How do you know my name?

21:12.719 --> 21:14.385
You've been after me
for some time.

21:14.387 --> 21:17.755
You think I don't make it a
priority to know who's after me?

21:17.757 --> 21:19.624
Now, here's how this will go.

21:19.626 --> 21:22.126
You're going to get on this
radio and tell your colleagues

21:22.128 --> 21:23.928
that you saw me
running towards the water.

21:23.930 --> 21:25.229
Right.

21:25.231 --> 21:27.398
And that's not gonna happen.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.334
And... if you shoot me,

21:30.336 --> 21:33.204
they are gonna hear it,
and they'll come after you.

21:33.206 --> 21:34.839
It will happen.

21:34.841 --> 21:37.842
Because if you don't
do as I say,

21:37.844 --> 21:41.212
your wife
and two children are dead.

21:41.214 --> 21:42.647
Hey.

21:42.649 --> 21:43.948
Don't believe me?

21:43.950 --> 21:46.718
You live at 2476 Kalawao Street.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.487
At this moment,
I have a man outside your house

21:49.489 --> 21:52.056
with eyes on your family.

21:52.058 --> 21:56.294
Call in the report
and save them.

22:00.233 --> 22:02.033
I have visual

22:02.035 --> 22:03.868
on an armed man
heading to the beach.

22:03.870 --> 22:05.910
- All right, I got this.
- I think it's Roman.

22:08.341 --> 22:11.075
Well done... Agent Morrison.

22:20.905 --> 22:21.701
<i>This is Captain Grover.</i>

22:21.702 --> 22:25.036
I need a full protection unit
at 2476 Kalawao Street.

22:25.038 --> 22:27.738
All notification is to
go through either me

22:27.740 --> 22:28.773
or Commander McGarrett.

22:28.775 --> 22:30.107
Mahalo.

22:30.109 --> 22:33.077
Listen, your wife and your kids
are fine; they're safe.

22:33.079 --> 22:34.378
They weren't even at home.

22:34.380 --> 22:36.280
Roman was bluffing.

22:36.282 --> 22:38.549
Yeah, but we're gonna have
HPD sit on your house

22:38.551 --> 22:40.518
until this thing's over.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.186
Hey...

22:42.188 --> 22:44.589
you played this thing
exactly the way you should've.

22:47.293 --> 22:50.061
Yeah.

22:51.197 --> 22:53.197
Um, that's

22:53.199 --> 22:56.500
Nicolai, Nicolai Krause.
And the other two were

22:56.502 --> 22:57.635
Vicktor and Julian.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.704
But I didn't get
their last names.

22:59.706 --> 23:02.073
All right, what about the fourth guy
in the house, the one who got away?

23:02.075 --> 23:03.474
Gatsby.

23:03.476 --> 23:04.976
Gatsby? That's what
he called himself?

23:04.978 --> 23:06.911
No, that's what
Lindsey called him.

23:06.913 --> 23:08.846
They never told us
his name.

23:08.848 --> 23:11.382
She just called him Gatsby
because he stayed out of sight

23:11.384 --> 23:13.184
while we all partied.
Well, you never

23:13.186 --> 23:14.218
saw him?

23:14.220 --> 23:17.588
No. Uh, except for
a few moments last night.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.056
<i>I went for a quick swim.</i>

23:19.058 --> 23:21.892
<i>And when I got out,</i>

23:21.894 --> 23:23.628
<i>there he was.</i>

23:23.630 --> 23:25.096
Did you see his face?

23:25.732 --> 23:27.798
Yeah, I guess.

23:38.111 --> 23:40.978
We're gonna transfer you to a
secure wing in the hospital,

23:40.980 --> 23:42.613
then I'm gonna set you up
with a sketch artist there.

23:42.615 --> 23:44.615
Is that okay?
All right, good.

23:46.953 --> 23:49.620
We should also have TSA
track down that friend of hers.

23:49.622 --> 23:50.588
Give Kono a heads up.

23:50.590 --> 23:51.922
If Danielle saw

23:51.924 --> 23:53.758
Roman's face, that's motive
for him to go after her.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.925
Yeah.

24:06.372 --> 24:07.972
Aloha.
Good afternoon, sir.

24:07.974 --> 24:10.041
Welcome to the Moana Surfrider,
a Westin Resort and Spa.

24:10.043 --> 24:11.475
Please have
this validated.

24:11.477 --> 24:13.311
Thank you.
Mahalo.

24:16.582 --> 24:18.849
♪ ♪

24:27.393 --> 24:29.460
Hey, Jerry.

24:29.462 --> 24:30.761
Aloha, dude.

24:30.763 --> 24:32.396
Thanks for
meeting me here.

24:32.398 --> 24:33.798
No trubs.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.666
Fortunately, my schedule
was light today.

24:35.668 --> 24:37.335
What's up?

24:37.337 --> 24:39.337
Kono once mentioned
you had a friend who worked

24:39.339 --> 24:40.638
at Leonard's Bakery.
Is that right?

24:40.640 --> 24:43.207
Zak. He's practically
<i>'ohana.</i> Why?

24:43.209 --> 24:46.210
They make this macadamia nut
malasada that Kono loves.

24:46.212 --> 24:48.512
I want to get her a box.
But the thing is

24:48.514 --> 24:49.914
they only make it once a year.

24:49.916 --> 24:52.416
Do you think it's possible
to get your-your friend to...

24:52.418 --> 24:53.418
Do a special order?

24:53.419 --> 24:54.785
Yeah,

24:54.787 --> 24:55.820
I could probably make that
happen.

24:55.822 --> 24:57.521
Mahalo, Jerry.

24:57.523 --> 24:59.824
You okay?

24:59.826 --> 25:03.127
Yeah. You know...

25:03.129 --> 25:06.997
Kono and I had a... pretty big
argument this morning,

25:06.999 --> 25:08.399
and I just...
Peace offering.

25:08.401 --> 25:09.867
Yeah.
Enough said.

25:09.869 --> 25:11.068
But you know
you're getting off easy.

25:11.070 --> 25:12.269
Most women would cost you
a diamond bracelet,

25:12.271 --> 25:14.438
but not Kono.
Yeah, that kind of stuff

25:14.440 --> 25:15.773
doesn't matter to Kono,
you know?

25:15.775 --> 25:19.043
She's... she's all
about the simple things.

25:19.746 --> 25:21.112
That's what I love about her.

25:21.114 --> 25:22.213
No, no, no, no.

25:22.215 --> 25:24.215
Put your money away.
Just let me take that hot

25:24.217 --> 25:25.983
little number
for a spin sometime.

25:26.853 --> 25:29.320
No, not Kono. Your Ferrari.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.023
Of course. Right.

25:33.025 --> 25:35.192
Thanks, man.

25:42.668 --> 25:44.402
He had less hair

25:44.404 --> 25:46.604
than that.

25:51.577 --> 25:55.279
So, Danielle's sketch is now out
to HPD and TSA. This guy Roman

25:55.281 --> 25:57.114
might be smart, but he
ain't gonna be able to hide

25:57.116 --> 25:59.917
in plain sight anymore. Actually,
I might have a way to make him

25:59.919 --> 26:00.885
come to us.

26:00.887 --> 26:02.486
Ames's cell phone
just got a text

26:02.488 --> 26:04.755
from an unidentified caller.

26:04.757 --> 26:05.890
“Five-O raided house.

26:05.892 --> 26:07.658
Need immediate exfil
off the island.”

26:07.660 --> 26:09.293
It's got to be Roman.
He doesn't know

26:09.295 --> 26:11.662
- Ames is dead.
- So why don't we have Ames

26:11.664 --> 26:13.297
text him back, set up a meet.

26:15.134 --> 26:17.101
Look, I'm just saying,
I mean, I don't know

26:17.103 --> 26:19.570
what the drama was all about,
but the guy feels terrible.

26:19.572 --> 26:21.539
And I don't
really know Adam,

26:21.541 --> 26:23.908
but I could tell he's
been beating himself up.

26:23.910 --> 26:26.243
So what do you think?
Could you forgive him?

26:26.245 --> 26:27.945
Well, there's nothing really
to forgive.

26:27.947 --> 26:31.315
I mean, uh, we had an argument.
Couples argue.

26:31.317 --> 26:32.983
Oh. So you guys are cool now?

26:32.985 --> 26:35.252
Well, it's not
that simple.

26:35.254 --> 26:37.888
Okay. Well, whatever it is,
I hope you guys work it out.

26:37.890 --> 26:39.490
I think Adam's a real keeper.

26:39.492 --> 26:42.226
You just said you didn't know
the guy very well.

26:42.228 --> 26:45.596
I know he's got big bucks,
great hair, and an awesome car.

26:45.598 --> 26:47.164
Full disclosure:

26:47.166 --> 26:49.700
I kind of have a little
man crush on the guy.

26:52.104 --> 26:54.505
Ooh. I got to get to work.
Time to spin the sign.

26:54.507 --> 26:55.806
Oh, yeah. Hey,
I heard about your new job.

26:55.808 --> 26:57.741
How's that going?
It's great.

26:57.743 --> 26:59.210
Added a few new moves
to the repertoire.

26:59.212 --> 27:00.911
Sidearm toss. Rowboat.

27:00.913 --> 27:03.547
I'm really crushing this whole
human directional gig.

27:04.650 --> 27:06.016
It's an industry term.

27:06.018 --> 27:08.419
Right. Well, I'm glad
it's going really well for you.

27:08.421 --> 27:09.587
One for the road?

27:09.589 --> 27:10.688
I really shouldn't.

27:10.690 --> 27:12.389
Yeah, you should.

27:12.391 --> 27:13.858
Well...

27:13.860 --> 27:15.726
I do burn some serious calories
doing what I do.

27:15.728 --> 27:17.294
Mahalo.

27:17.296 --> 27:18.729
Hey, nice to meet you, dude.

27:18.731 --> 27:20.030
You look good for a dead man.

27:21.634 --> 27:23.067
That guy works for Five-O?

27:23.069 --> 27:24.368
What is he, your mascot?

27:24.370 --> 27:27.371
He doesn't really have a title.

27:27.373 --> 27:29.006
Well, your
boyfriend sounds

27:29.008 --> 27:31.175
like a decent guy.
How long you been with him?

27:31.177 --> 27:32.243
Three years.

27:32.245 --> 27:34.178
Three years?
And you're not hitched?

27:34.180 --> 27:37.214
We're, um... you know,
we're working things out.

27:37.216 --> 27:39.250
So, three?
What's the holdup?

27:39.252 --> 27:40.451
What, are we girlfriends?

27:40.453 --> 27:42.520
Look, I'm not discussing this
with you.

27:42.522 --> 27:44.855
Ah, well, he sounds
crazy about you,

27:44.857 --> 27:47.358
so... I'm guessing
you're the problem.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.660
You're the one
who can't commit.

27:49.662 --> 27:51.428
What's that all about?

27:53.032 --> 27:55.733
Look, there's
just an issue, okay?

27:55.735 --> 27:57.701
And I'm not sure
I can get past it.

27:57.703 --> 28:00.304
Look, I'm not gonna
cross-examine you.

28:00.306 --> 28:02.907
But can I say one more thing?
No.

28:02.909 --> 28:04.808
Look, what you're doing,
it ain't cool.

28:04.810 --> 28:06.544
If you can't commit by now,

28:06.546 --> 28:09.280
you need to be fair to the guy
and cut him loose.

28:10.116 --> 28:13.250
Don't be
stringing him along.

28:13.252 --> 28:15.286
Okay, look, I'm gonna
go downstairs and get a coffee.

28:15.288 --> 28:16.887
You want one?

28:16.889 --> 28:19.056
No. I'm gonna do another lap.

28:19.058 --> 28:20.925
Okay.
Don't overdo it.

28:20.927 --> 28:22.560
Yes, Doctor.

28:33.406 --> 28:34.905
I don't like this.

28:34.907 --> 28:36.140
There's too many civilians.

28:36.142 --> 28:37.341
Roman chose the spot.

28:37.343 --> 28:39.076
We don't have a choice.

28:41.013 --> 28:42.813
I got something.

28:42.815 --> 28:44.381
East side of the park.
Gray jacket.

28:44.383 --> 28:47.084
- It could be him.
- Yeah, I got him.

28:49.889 --> 28:51.288
It's him.

28:51.791 --> 28:53.958
Move out.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.061
Roman Zednick!
Freeze!

28:57.063 --> 28:58.829
Five-O!
Everybody down!

29:00.166 --> 29:01.765
Move your hands
out of your pockets

29:01.767 --> 29:03.834
nice and slow.
Put 'em behind your head.

29:05.204 --> 29:06.437
Slowly!

30:15.107 --> 30:17.474
All right, so here's the I.D.
we took off Roman.

30:17.476 --> 30:19.710
It looks like he's using
the alias Emil Hossa.

30:19.712 --> 30:21.545
I'm guessing that's one
you haven't heard before.

30:21.547 --> 30:23.514
No, but I'm hoping
once we dig into it,

30:23.516 --> 30:25.215
we'll get some Intel
on Roman's network.

30:25.217 --> 30:26.717
Excuse me, Commander,
but this guy says

30:26.719 --> 30:27.751
he needs
to speak with you.

30:27.753 --> 30:28.986
Yeah. Whoa,
whoa, whoa.

30:28.988 --> 30:30.754
Easy, ea...
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

30:30.756 --> 30:32.056
Down, poochie.

30:32.058 --> 30:33.223
Marcus, what's with the dog?

30:33.225 --> 30:35.192
He's cross-trained
in explosives and narcotics.

30:35.194 --> 30:37.161
And while we didn't find either
on him, I suspect

30:37.163 --> 30:39.029
he may have had some <i> pakalolo</i>
in his pocket at some point.

30:39.031 --> 30:40.631
What?
Relax.

30:40.633 --> 30:41.913
Okay, I got him. Thanks, Marcus.

30:44.737 --> 30:46.670
Five-O Batcave, huh?

30:46.672 --> 30:50.708
Guys, meet, uh,
Odell Martin.

30:50.710 --> 30:51.742
Howzit, fellas?

30:51.744 --> 30:52.943
Hey.

30:52.945 --> 30:54.578
What's going on?
I hear you boys

30:54.580 --> 30:57.881
took down some big target
this afternoon, huh? That right?

30:58.551 --> 30:59.750
Where'd you hear that?

31:00.986 --> 31:02.086
I got my sources.

31:02.088 --> 31:03.954
So... is that true?

31:03.956 --> 31:04.922
You guys bag Roman?

31:04.924 --> 31:06.256
We are confirming,

31:06.258 --> 31:08.192
but, yeah, it looks that way.

31:08.194 --> 31:10.994
And let me guess,
he was using the name...

31:10.996 --> 31:12.129
Emil Hossa.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.697
Okay.
Hey, wait a minute.

31:13.699 --> 31:14.965
Seriously, where are you
getting your information?

31:14.967 --> 31:16.266
That's not important.

31:16.268 --> 31:17.935
What is important
is that you guys know

31:17.937 --> 31:19.570
that there's chatter
going around

31:19.572 --> 31:21.071
that Roman's using a decoy.

31:21.073 --> 31:23.674
And the decoy's
name...

31:23.676 --> 31:25.275
is Emil Hossa.

31:25.277 --> 31:26.977
So you're telling us
the guy we took down

31:26.979 --> 31:28.479
ain't Roman.
That's what

31:28.481 --> 31:29.379
I'm telling you.

31:29.381 --> 31:31.115
So where the hell's

31:31.117 --> 31:32.382
the real Roman?

31:50.336 --> 31:52.636
<i>We got a deal or not?</i>

31:52.638 --> 31:54.705
<i>I said I'll consider it.</i>

31:54.707 --> 31:57.341
I want to talk
to who's in charge.

31:57.343 --> 31:58.122
I'm sorry?

31:58.146 --> 32:00.146
I done enough deals to know
that you're not the one

32:00.179 --> 32:01.179
callin' the shots.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.246
You're not Roman.

32:02.248 --> 32:03.380
You're right, Mr. Dekker.

32:03.382 --> 32:05.082
He's not Roman.

32:05.084 --> 32:06.650
I am.

32:22.835 --> 32:24.434
Afternoon, ma'am.

32:24.436 --> 32:25.636
I'm Agent Corin with ICE.

32:25.638 --> 32:26.637
I'm here to take you home.

32:49.063 --> 32:50.329
She's here!

32:50.331 --> 32:51.684
Roman is here!
What?

32:51.685 --> 32:53.317
She's on this floor!

33:00.393 --> 33:02.693
Get in!

33:10.236 --> 33:12.503
Get back! Get back!

33:21.429 --> 33:23.909
Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.

33:49.809 --> 33:52.043
♪ ♪

34:11.464 --> 34:12.830
Okay.

34:15.034 --> 34:16.333
Hurry.
All right.

34:16.335 --> 34:17.902
You have to come down.
Aah!

34:39.525 --> 34:41.559
She must have crashed
the entire wing.

34:41.561 --> 34:43.761
What?

34:43.763 --> 34:45.496
The hospital's prison section

34:45.498 --> 34:46.563
has its own
security system.

34:46.565 --> 34:47.931
If a lockdown
is triggered,

34:47.934 --> 34:50.101
then all the entrances and
exits automatically lock.

34:50.103 --> 34:51.569
So we're trapped?

34:51.571 --> 34:54.205
Yeah.

34:54.206 --> 34:55.873
And now that we know
who she really is,

34:55.875 --> 34:58.009
Roman's not gonna let
us out of here alive.

35:00.079 --> 35:02.780
Come on. We got
to get moving.

35:02.782 --> 35:05.182
Let's go.

35:18.898 --> 35:20.564
Those were the guys
from the house,

35:20.566 --> 35:22.633
and according to the paper
Interpol has on 'em,

35:22.635 --> 35:25.269
they're all low-level-- neither
one of them could be Roman.

35:25.271 --> 35:26.637
Okay, thanks.

35:26.639 --> 35:29.874
That was strange.
Just got off the phone with TSA.

35:29.876 --> 35:31.175
Danielle's friend
Lindsey--

35:31.177 --> 35:32.476
turns out no one
with that name

35:32.478 --> 35:33.678
boarded any plane today.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.179
<i>Where's Lindsey now?</i>

35:35.181 --> 35:37.682
<i> She left.</i>
<i>She had a plane to catch.</i>

35:37.684 --> 35:39.016
Why would Danielle lie to us?

35:39.018 --> 35:41.118
Because this whole thing
was an act.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.620
She wasn't
an innocent bystander,

35:42.622 --> 35:44.288
she <i> is</i> Roman.

35:44.290 --> 35:46.490
Think about it--
a bullet comes through

35:46.492 --> 35:49.064
the wall, she gets hurt, she
knows she's not going anywhere.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.861
So she pretends
to be some party girl.

35:50.863 --> 35:53.164
Kono's not picking up her phone.

35:53.166 --> 35:55.366
The agent we sent over there
isn't responding either.

36:04.077 --> 36:05.876
Okay.

36:05.878 --> 36:08.079
Come on.

36:14.454 --> 36:16.454
Okay, here... here...

36:16.456 --> 36:19.190
There.

36:19.192 --> 36:21.392
Oh, God.

36:33.206 --> 36:34.705
Okay, look,

36:34.707 --> 36:36.574
I'm gonna need
to leave you here,

36:36.576 --> 36:37.808
try to get word to the outside.

36:37.810 --> 36:39.777
Phones are dead.

36:39.779 --> 36:41.345
Your cell's useless.

36:41.347 --> 36:43.714
What's your plan--
smoke signals?

36:43.716 --> 36:45.549
If there's an O.R.
on this floor,

36:45.551 --> 36:48.085
it should have its own generator
and a videoconferencing system.

36:48.087 --> 36:49.887
Hey, come on.

36:49.889 --> 36:52.223
Look, it's on the other side,
but I think I can do it.
