Will someone please explain
what's happening?

19:13.124 --> 19:15.792
More like, <i>who's</i> happening,
right, guys?

19:21.216 --> 19:23.283
Guys, I'm sorry I got
carried away

19:23.318 --> 19:25.051
with the slow cooker,

19:25.086 --> 19:27.086
but my pursuit of perfection
was not totally in vain,

19:27.122 --> 19:28.755
'cause like the pork,

19:28.757 --> 19:30.924
our friendship has been
simmered to perfection.

19:30.976 --> 19:32.592
Let's eat!

19:32.627 --> 19:34.928
Mmm. Mmm.

19:34.930 --> 19:36.179
Divine.

19:38.733 --> 19:41.768
Yet it leaves something behind.

19:41.820 --> 19:43.269
Metallic, maybe?

19:43.321 --> 19:46.606
Furry.
Almost moving?

19:46.658 --> 19:49.909
With perhaps maggoty undertones?

19:52.781 --> 19:54.113
Who gave you the stupid idea

19:54.165 --> 19:56.916
you could eat
12-day-old pork?

19:56.952 --> 19:58.418
He did!

I gotta restrain this one.

20:08.096 --> 20:10.797
He's on to us.

20:10.849 --> 20:12.799
This isn't an ambulance!

It's a goddamn hambulance!

Thanks for looking out
for me, Jeff.

I'm glad to be back
to my old self,

is gone for good.

It's all right, babe.
I love you no matter what.

- Hey, you wanna grab a bite
before the PETA protest? - Sure.

20:40.049 --> 20:43.416
For some reason, I could go
for a scoop of mint chip.

20:43.536 --> 20:47.779
Hey, you're smiling babe.
That's one for the scrap book.

20:50.942 --> 20:53.019
