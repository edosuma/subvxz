00:02.753 --> 00:03.977
<i>Previously on</i> KC Undercover...

00:04.012 --> 00:06.605
Hi. Is this
the Cooper residence?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.331
I'm actually here
for Kira Cooper.

00:08.366 --> 00:09.365
I think she might be
my mother's sister.

00:09.401 --> 00:12.219
Say she is my niece; If she's
anything like her mother,

00:12.254 --> 00:13.945
that girl is no good.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.964
I don't want anyone
from this family

00:15.999 --> 00:17.807
to have any contact
whatsoever with that Abby girl.

00:17.843 --> 00:21.036
I'm sorry, I didn't get to
properly introduce myself before.

00:21.071 --> 00:24.731
I'm KC Cooper,
and I'm your cousin.

00:24.767 --> 00:26.433
Come on in.

00:31.398 --> 00:32.864
I'm so glad we got to hang.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.600
The thought of having a cousin

00:34.635 --> 00:35.984
is just blowing my mind.

00:36.020 --> 00:38.045
Now we can say, "What up, cuz?"

00:38.080 --> 00:40.272
and not sound dumb.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.065
No, it still sounds dumb.

00:42.101 --> 00:44.935
Any chance you can sneak
away again some time soon?

00:44.970 --> 00:46.745
What my mom doesn't know
won't hurt her, right?

00:46.780 --> 00:48.696
Right. It's not like
she's some super spy

00:48.732 --> 00:49.623
who knows what you're
doing every second.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.817
( Forced laugh )

00:51.852 --> 00:54.027
My mom, a spy?
That is hysterical.

00:54.062 --> 00:55.979
'Cause my mom
is not a spy at all.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.839
In any way.

00:57.875 --> 01:00.050
She's a spy. What? I should go.

01:04.215 --> 01:05.922
Judy, what are you doing here?

01:05.957 --> 01:07.582
I have a better question.

01:07.617 --> 01:09.309
What are you doing here?

01:09.345 --> 01:13.739
I, uh... am sleepwalking,

01:13.816 --> 01:15.640
and you should not
wake me 'cause it is dangerous.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.568
What's dangerous is going
against your mother's orders.

01:18.603 --> 01:20.211
- Judy, please...
- Don't "Judy please" me.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.681
I have to tell Agent Kira.

01:22.716 --> 01:25.442
Why can't we just keep a
secret between us sisters?

01:25.477 --> 01:27.711
The last time you kept a secret,

01:27.788 --> 01:29.948
you got everyone kicked out
of the Organization.

01:29.982 --> 01:32.207
Okay, can we please stop
living in the past?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.835
Look, I'm begging you.

01:35.870 --> 01:36.995
Can you please just
keep this between us?

01:37.030 --> 01:39.189
Well, when you put it like that,

01:39.224 --> 01:40.982
all I can say is...

01:41.018 --> 01:42.967
She went against your wishes,

01:43.003 --> 01:44.261
lied to you, then threatened me

01:44.296 --> 01:46.946
if I told you.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.682
I think that about
covers everything.

01:48.717 --> 01:49.850
Night, everyone.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.114
Good work, Judy. Good work.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.666
See, I was testing her
surveillance and reporting skills.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.477
She passed with flying colors.

02:00.512 --> 02:03.188
That's my girl.

02:03.223 --> 02:05.663
I'll show myself to my room now.

02:07.010 --> 02:10.312
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

02:10.347 --> 02:13.507
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

02:13.584 --> 02:16.426
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

02:16.461 --> 02:21.522
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

02:21.558 --> 02:25.226
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

02:25.261 --> 02:27.320
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

02:27.356 --> 02:31.433
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:31.468 --> 02:35.328
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:35.364 --> 02:37.397
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:37.432 --> 02:39.674
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:39.709 --> 02:42.110
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:42.146 --> 02:44.220
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:44.255 --> 02:46.106
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:46.141 --> 02:48.058
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:48.093 --> 02:50.944
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:50.979 --> 02:52.045
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:52.080 --> 02:54.406
I keep it undercover.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.041
I keep it undercover.

03:03.233 --> 03:05.091
All right, the laptop
we're assigned to retrieve

03:05.126 --> 03:06.301
is on the 15th floor,
so once we get there,

03:06.336 --> 03:08.294
we gotta break through
the window, grab it,

03:08.330 --> 03:10.789
- and then rappel down. Sound good?
- Why ask me?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.282
You're just gonna do
what you wanna do anyway.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.861
Why do I have a feeling we're not
talking about the mission anymore?

03:15.896 --> 03:17.404
I specifically told you
not to see Abby,

03:17.439 --> 03:19.397
and you did it anyway.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.525
Really? We're gonna
talk about this now?

03:21.560 --> 03:23.877
This can't wait till we're not
dangling 40 stories in the air

03:23.912 --> 03:27.447
dodging pigeon poop?

03:27.482 --> 03:28.915
You could be putting us
all in danger with that girl.

03:28.950 --> 03:30.625
That girl is your niece.

03:30.661 --> 03:33.520
So she says.

03:33.555 --> 03:35.915
For someone so smart, you're
acting straight-up stupid.

03:36.991 --> 03:39.000
For all we know,
she could be an enemy agent.

03:39.036 --> 03:41.244
Really? Who worked her butt off

03:41.280 --> 03:43.421
to get a scholarship
to Howard University,

03:43.456 --> 03:44.547
and in between
her job at the bookstore,

03:44.582 --> 03:47.559
and studying for midterms,
she's plotting against us?

03:47.594 --> 03:49.385
You said it, I didn't.

03:49.421 --> 03:51.712
You just didn't like her mother.

03:51.748 --> 03:53.114
How would you like it
if people judged you

03:53.150 --> 03:54.340
based on who your sister was?

03:54.375 --> 03:57.110
They do!

03:57.187 --> 03:58.311
Do you know how many times
I've been interrogated

03:58.346 --> 04:00.530
by the Organization
because of my sister?

04:00.565 --> 04:03.441
And they look at me
a little sideways

04:03.476 --> 04:05.827
because maybe, just maybe,
I'm like her.

04:05.862 --> 04:08.146
And I have to prove to them
every day

04:08.182 --> 04:10.123
that I am a different person
than she was.

04:10.158 --> 04:12.542
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

04:12.577 --> 04:14.661
I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

04:14.696 --> 04:16.737
No, you didn't.

04:16.773 --> 04:18.813
Now promise me you'll
never see her again.

04:20.235 --> 04:22.160
- Promise me!
- Fine. I promise.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.195
Good.

04:25.532 --> 04:28.199
Fifteenth floor.
Okay, get in there.

04:28.234 --> 04:31.494
Uh, Mom, I think
we calculated wrong,

04:31.529 --> 04:33.822
because that's
the men's bathroom,

04:33.857 --> 04:36.491
and it's<i> ocupado.</i>

04:36.527 --> 04:39.602
Is this East Grand Street
or West Grand Street?

04:39.637 --> 04:42.781
It's North Elm.
Do we even have a mission,

04:42.816 --> 04:44.682
or did you just bring me up here

04:44.718 --> 04:46.758
to yell at me
where no one could hear you?

04:56.145 --> 04:58.229
Hold up.

04:58.264 --> 05:00.504
I've gotta talk
to you, robo-snitch.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.426
Talk to the hand.

05:03.461 --> 05:05.287
You can't be trusted.

05:05.322 --> 05:06.980
Ratting out KC was wrong.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.924
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

05:09.959 --> 05:11.902
Whatever. I'm programmed
to tell the truth.

05:11.937 --> 05:14.337
It's a robot thing.

05:14.373 --> 05:17.373
Well, let me tell you
about a human thing.

05:17.408 --> 05:19.550
It's called looking out
for your own.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.277
I've had plenty of
opportunities to rat KC out,

05:21.313 --> 05:23.613
but I didn't.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.823
Like the time she was
two hours late for curfew.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.685
Or when she cut school to go to
that Stephen Hawking lecture.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.112
Or when I found out
KC told Marisa

05:31.147 --> 05:32.781
we were spies.
I could've ratted her out,

05:32.816 --> 05:34.291
but I didn't.

05:34.326 --> 05:36.885
I kept my mouth shut,
and never told a single soul.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.453
Until now.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.316
Uh-oh.

05:43.351 --> 05:45.360
Please don't tell anyone
I said that.

05:45.395 --> 05:48.054
Relax. Just because
you can't keep a secret

05:48.089 --> 05:49.731
doesn't mean I can't.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.099
Oh, good.

05:51.135 --> 05:52.258
For a price.

05:55.496 --> 05:57.013
Uh-oh.

06:02.671 --> 06:04.962
Hey, KC, we still on
for tonight?

06:04.998 --> 06:08.108
( Unintelligible )

06:08.143 --> 06:10.927
She said yeah, she always
enjoys hanging out with you.

06:10.963 --> 06:13.196
( Unintelligible )

06:15.808 --> 06:19.069
And she will wear whatever adorable
outfit I pick out for her.

06:19.104 --> 06:22.664
Oh, don't bother. I like when she wears the
red plaid shirt wrapped around her waist.

06:24.393 --> 06:25.917
( laughs )

06:28.021 --> 06:30.538
Fine. You two
are a perfect match.

06:30.574 --> 06:32.614
You don't dress well,
and he doesn't care.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.244
So tell me about
this cousin of yours.

06:36.279 --> 06:38.796
Is she pretty,
is she fashionable?

06:38.832 --> 06:40.957
Can she introduce me
to cute college boys?

06:40.993 --> 06:43.384
Yes, yes, and, um,

06:43.420 --> 06:44.694
why don't you work on
getting into college

06:44.729 --> 06:47.530
so you can meet those boys
on your own?

06:47.565 --> 06:50.375
Ugh, sounds like a lot of work.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.744
Abby's a lot of fun.

06:52.779 --> 06:54.629
She likes reading
and math and science.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.031
I gotta say, it's
really cool having a cousin.

06:57.066 --> 06:58.140
It's too bad your mom
won't let you see her anymore.

06:58.176 --> 07:01.886
( Unintelligible )

07:01.922 --> 07:04.372
You're still gonna see her?!

07:04.407 --> 07:06.416
Well, yeah. She's my cousin.
I can't just walk away.

07:06.451 --> 07:08.969
I can't believe

07:09.045 --> 07:10.762
you're going to deliberately
disobey your mother.

07:10.797 --> 07:11.921
My baby's all grown up.

07:14.008 --> 07:16.551
Look, people think KC Cooper

07:16.587 --> 07:17.552
is some kind of goody-two shoes.

07:17.587 --> 07:20.029
I'm not. Okay?

07:20.065 --> 07:22.223
I am a rebel. I am bad news.

07:22.259 --> 07:24.559
I am a rule breaker, you know?

07:24.594 --> 07:27.019
Hey!

07:27.055 --> 07:28.935
That goes in the recycling bin.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.608
Thank you.

07:37.215 --> 07:40.250
Thank you. Look at that.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.492
Half meat lover's,
half vegetarian lover's pizza.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.178
They look pretty happy together.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.134
I guess opposites
really do attract.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.710
Oh! Whoa!

07:52.522 --> 07:53.963
Man, that's hot!

07:56.810 --> 07:59.594
Burned my mouth.
That was embarrassing.

08:01.489 --> 08:03.806
Not only am I bad at dating,

08:03.841 --> 08:06.643
but apparently, I'm not
very good at eating either.

08:06.678 --> 08:08.653
Hey, everyone's bad at dating
until you find the right person.

08:08.688 --> 08:12.098
Besides, you're getting better.

08:12.133 --> 08:14.842
Last time we went out, you shot
apple juice through your nose.

08:14.877 --> 08:16.494
Yeah. The worst part
about that was,

08:16.529 --> 08:18.196
I did it to impress you.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.072
- It didn't.
- I see that now.

08:21.951 --> 08:23.618
I hope you don't mind,

08:23.653 --> 08:25.562
but I asked my cousin
to join us later.

08:25.597 --> 08:28.423
You invited someone else?
You really are bad at dating.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.800
Yeah, I know, it's a little
weird, but our moms

08:30.836 --> 08:32.360
didn't really get along, so
we're not supposed to hang out.

08:32.395 --> 08:34.637
Hey, no problem. It's cool.

08:34.673 --> 08:36.197
Good, because my grandparents
are actually gonna come later.

08:36.232 --> 08:38.333
- Seriously?
- I'm kidding. Kidding.

08:38.368 --> 08:40.401
All right?
Not that bad at dating.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.679
Oh, hey, Abby, right here.

08:42.714 --> 08:44.873
This is Darien.

08:44.908 --> 08:47.417
Hi, Darien. Nice to...
Wait, are you on a date?

08:47.452 --> 08:48.693
I didn't know
you were on a date.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.112
I wouldn't have come.
I should leave, shouldn't I?

08:51.147 --> 08:52.730
Wait, you invited me.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.132
Is this normal? I wouldn't know.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.985
- I'm really bad at dating.
- This must be your cousin.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.928
Hi, I'm Abby.

08:58.963 --> 09:01.797
Wow, you guys
look like each other.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.282
You kinda act the same, too.

09:03.318 --> 09:04.876
BOTH: We're not that much alike.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.103
( Giggling )

09:07.138 --> 09:09.455
BOTH: Okay, maybe we are.

09:13.603 --> 09:15.561
You know, Ernie,
I was thinking about

09:15.597 --> 09:17.129
this whole
"keeping a secret" thing.

09:17.165 --> 09:20.283
( Hesitantly ) Yeah?

09:20.318 --> 09:22.168
Well, it sure would be
a lot easier

09:22.203 --> 09:24.136
if I had a nice bed to sleep on.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.322
You want me to buy you a bed?

09:26.357 --> 09:28.308
No, don't be silly.

09:28.343 --> 09:31.285
I want your bed.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.337
Okay, but I have to warn you.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.623
I sometimes snore.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.259
It won't bother me,

09:38.294 --> 09:41.855
because once that lid's closed,
that baby is soundproof.

09:41.890 --> 09:43.606
I'm not sleeping in there.

09:43.642 --> 09:45.700
You will if you want me
to stay soundproof.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.775
You're late.

09:54.810 --> 09:56.703
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

09:56.738 --> 09:57.587
You were with Abby, weren't you?

09:57.622 --> 09:59.564
You know, Mom,

09:59.599 --> 10:01.516
I cannot lie to you,

10:01.551 --> 10:03.117
so I'm just gonna
tell you the truth.

10:03.153 --> 10:05.503
I was with Darien.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.130
Darien?

10:08.166 --> 10:10.900
That really cute
football player from school?

10:10.935 --> 10:12.519
Is he cute? I didn't notice.

10:12.554 --> 10:15.496
Yes, he's cute.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.206
And you were out with him?

10:17.242 --> 10:21.277
You missed your curfew,
and I am so mad at you.

10:23.531 --> 10:24.747
Really? It looks like
you're smiling.

10:24.782 --> 10:27.158
No. No, I am scowling.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.519
This is me not happy with you.

10:29.554 --> 10:31.679
My baby is dating
a football player.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.232
We're not.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.976
We're not dating, okay?
We're just hanging out.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.579
Oh, fine, but if you
pull this nonsense again,

10:39.614 --> 10:41.814
then I am grounding you, missy.

10:42.925 --> 10:44.383
So I'm not in trouble?

10:44.419 --> 10:46.469
Come on, KC, you're a good kid.

10:48.990 --> 10:51.549
I am a good kid...

10:51.585 --> 10:54.977
except for the lying
and the sneaking around

10:55.013 --> 10:57.079
and the deliberately disobey...

10:57.115 --> 11:00.024
Oh, no. I've become Marisa.

11:06.007 --> 11:08.390
Morning, sunshine.

11:08.426 --> 11:10.693
Did you sleep well?

11:10.728 --> 11:13.254
You know who sleeps
well in a box?

11:13.290 --> 11:15.523
Dead people.

11:15.559 --> 11:17.767
Well, look alive,

11:17.803 --> 11:19.819
because Agent Kira
has just given us a mission.

11:19.854 --> 11:21.596
We have to retrieve
an important flash drive

11:21.631 --> 11:23.665
down a manhole on 23rd Street.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.608
Crawling into a sewer,
that's gross.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.685
Why can't you do it?

11:27.720 --> 11:30.422
It's called a manhole,
not a robot hole.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.473
And if I can learn a human thing

11:32.508 --> 11:34.776
like keeping a secret,
you can learn a robot thing

11:34.853 --> 11:36.952
like crawling through
a wet, dark, stinky sewer.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.371
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it!

11:39.407 --> 11:41.582
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.735
Lord help me, I'm doing it.

11:45.963 --> 11:48.414
JUDY: Just look for
the flash drive.

11:48.449 --> 11:50.090
- I think I found it.
- ( squeaking )

11:50.126 --> 11:52.126
Not a flash drive,
not a flash drive.

11:53.788 --> 11:55.872
Hey, you might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

11:55.907 --> 11:56.914
Why?

12:00.970 --> 12:02.487
That's why.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.923
I wanna go back in the box,
I wanna go back in the box!

12:10.063 --> 12:11.528
Hi, Kira.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.347
What did you just call me?

12:15.760 --> 12:17.535
Come on, we've known
each other forever.

12:17.570 --> 12:21.830
I'm not just your daughter's
friend, I'm your friend, too.

12:21.866 --> 12:22.816
It just seems so silly
to be so formal

12:22.851 --> 12:24.442
and call you...

12:24.477 --> 12:27.070
Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

12:27.105 --> 12:29.155
Hello, Marisa.

12:29.190 --> 12:32.333
So, where's KC?

12:32.368 --> 12:33.150
I thought she was with you.

12:33.185 --> 12:37.505
Busted!

12:37.540 --> 12:40.833
She, um, is with Darien.

12:40.868 --> 12:44.362
Yeah, she was afraid
that you would think

12:44.397 --> 12:46.664
that they are spending
too much time together,

12:46.700 --> 12:48.716
and the relationship
is going way too fast.

12:48.752 --> 12:50.301
She's with Darien, that's fine.

12:50.336 --> 12:53.354
He's a nice guy and I think
they make a cute couple.

12:53.389 --> 12:55.848
I totally agree, Kira.

12:57.502 --> 12:59.285
I mean, Mrs. Kira Cooper,

12:59.321 --> 13:02.538
adult lady who
I respectfully respect.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.813
( Knocking on door )

13:10.190 --> 13:11.950
Hey, Miss Cooper, is KC here?

13:13.793 --> 13:14.650
Darien, I thought
she was with you.

13:14.685 --> 13:16.894
With me?

13:16.929 --> 13:19.638
Oh, no, I totally forgot.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.824
She's with Marisa,
helping her study.

13:21.860 --> 13:24.141
You know that girl can use
all the help she can get.

13:27.115 --> 13:30.090
I will have you know
that I get A's in school,

13:30.126 --> 13:31.843
when I sit next to smart people.

13:34.071 --> 13:36.481
Oh, did I say she was
with Marisa?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.524
- What I meant to say...
- Don't bother.

13:38.559 --> 13:40.399
I know exactly who she's with.

13:44.874 --> 13:46.933
I'm telling you, I'm a way
bigger nerd than you are.

13:46.968 --> 13:49.385
- I don't think so.
- Oh, really?

13:49.420 --> 13:51.579
How many library cards
do you have?

13:51.614 --> 13:53.030
You really wanna play this game.

13:53.066 --> 13:56.141
- Let's go.
- Okay.

13:56.177 --> 13:58.185
Read 'em and weep.

13:58.220 --> 14:00.955
I've got Will County,
Cook County,

14:00.990 --> 14:02.890
DuPage County,

14:02.926 --> 14:06.995
and now,
the Howard University library.

14:07.030 --> 14:09.505
Too rich for my blood, or is it?

14:11.659 --> 14:13.209
We have Arlington County,

14:13.244 --> 14:15.420
Hamilton High,
Montgomery County,

14:15.455 --> 14:17.646
D.C. Metro area,
and what is this?

14:17.681 --> 14:21.333
The Library of Congress?

14:21.368 --> 14:24.420
No way! How'd you get that?

14:24.455 --> 14:26.247
I filled out an application.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.374
In person.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.001
On a Saturday night.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.452
Who's the nerd now?

14:31.487 --> 14:33.946
All hail, queen nerd!

14:37.477 --> 14:38.793
Mmm, I'm gonna
be late for class.

14:38.828 --> 14:39.908
Oh, I'll walk you out.

15:00.958 --> 15:04.260
Hey, I need to talk to you.

15:04.295 --> 15:06.253
What you pulled yesterday put me in
a really uncomfortable position.

15:06.288 --> 15:07.955
Worse than that time
you insisted on

15:07.991 --> 15:09.816
doing hot yoga
in your skinny jeans?

15:09.851 --> 15:13.393
I am serious. If I'm gonna
look bad in front of your mom,

15:13.429 --> 15:15.629
it should be because
of something that I did.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.673
This cousin of yours
is a bad influence on you,

15:17.708 --> 15:19.192
and that is my job.

15:19.227 --> 15:21.285
Okay, Marisa, don't worry, okay.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.904
You will always
bring out the worst in me.

15:23.940 --> 15:24.888
Now can you please tell me
what you're talking about?

15:24.924 --> 15:27.032
I was at your house
looking for you,

15:27.068 --> 15:29.001
and your mom
thought that you were with me.

15:29.036 --> 15:31.045
But because I can think
fast on my feet...

15:31.081 --> 15:32.996
You mean lie fast on your feet.

15:33.032 --> 15:36.217
Whatever. I said that
you were with Darien.

15:36.252 --> 15:38.752
She believed me, and everything
was fine until he showed up.

15:38.788 --> 15:41.488
So she knows I wasn't
with you or Darien?

15:41.524 --> 15:42.940
Then she knows that
I was with Abby.

15:42.975 --> 15:45.309
Why am I still alive?

15:45.344 --> 15:47.612
I believe she is going with
the classic

15:47.614 --> 15:50.072
"guilting you into
telling her the truth" routine.

15:50.107 --> 15:52.174
It is an oldie but a goodie.

15:52.209 --> 15:53.943
But don't fall for it.
It is a game of chicken,

15:53.978 --> 15:56.304
and you have to be
the last chick standing.

15:56.339 --> 15:58.864
Wow. No one knows more
about lying than you do.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.458
And I mean that as a compliment.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.576
Which is how I took it.

16:01.611 --> 16:02.827
See ya later.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.627
Hey, I need to talk to you.

16:11.662 --> 16:13.429
Oh, Marisa just told me. I'm
really sorry about that, Darien.

16:13.464 --> 16:15.431
Yeah, here's the thing.

16:15.466 --> 16:17.408
If you wanna go
behind your mom's back,

16:17.443 --> 16:19.260
and hang out with your cousin,
that's on you.

16:19.295 --> 16:21.829
I know. It's messed up.
I gotta be honest with her.

16:21.864 --> 16:23.722
Good, because
the last thing I need

16:23.757 --> 16:24.807
is for her to hate
the guy you're seeing.

16:24.842 --> 16:27.944
( Bell rings )

16:27.979 --> 16:29.803
Wait, seeing?
We're seeing each other.

16:29.839 --> 16:31.563
We're seeing each...
We're seeing each other!

16:31.599 --> 16:33.474
We're seeing each other.

16:33.509 --> 16:35.634
Not you and me.

16:35.669 --> 16:38.095
I can see you but...
( stammering )

16:38.130 --> 16:40.050
Darien and I, we're...
I gotta go.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.872
We analyzed the glass
you brought in,

16:47.907 --> 16:50.091
and we have the results
from the DNA test.

16:50.126 --> 16:51.875
And that Abby girl is lying.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.360
We're not really related, right?

16:53.396 --> 16:55.154
No, it's a match.

16:55.190 --> 16:56.480
No doubt about it.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.641
So then...

16:58.676 --> 16:59.725
she's really my niece?

16:59.761 --> 17:01.110
Yes, she is.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.470
I can't believe it.

17:02.505 --> 17:04.688
I have a niece.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.849
And she has a mother.

17:06.884 --> 17:08.334
Where is Erica?

17:08.369 --> 17:10.444
I told you, she's dead.

17:10.479 --> 17:12.379
We never found a body.

17:12.414 --> 17:13.856
You know more than
you're telling.

17:13.892 --> 17:16.067
What happened to your sister?

17:16.102 --> 17:18.902
For the millionth time,
I don't know, Agent Johnson.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.489
I've never known, Agent Johnson.

17:21.524 --> 17:25.442
But if I find out, I'll let
you know, Agent Johnson.

17:25.478 --> 17:29.788
Now, does the rest
of her story pan out or not?

17:29.824 --> 17:31.957
All right, take it easy.

17:34.495 --> 17:37.204
Chill out, Kira.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.480
Everything you wanna know
is in the file.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.125
I can't believe
what I'm reading.

17:50.161 --> 17:51.185
I gotta get to KC.

17:58.135 --> 18:00.828
KC, I need to talk to you.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.329
Mom, me first. I've been
going behind your back

18:02.364 --> 18:04.398
and spending time with Abby.

18:04.434 --> 18:07.142
- That's exactly what...
- Let me finish, okay?

18:07.178 --> 18:09.370
I lied,

18:09.405 --> 18:11.422
and I'm really sorry,
but you're the one

18:11.457 --> 18:13.107
who taught me that
family comes first.

18:13.142 --> 18:15.017
We're the only family
that Abby has.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.860
- That's what I'm trying...
- Just hear me out.

18:16.895 --> 18:19.280
Abby is a great girl, okay?

18:19.315 --> 18:22.141
She's already become
important to me,

18:22.176 --> 18:23.959
and I think
if you gave her a chance,

18:23.995 --> 18:25.386
she could become
very important to you, too.

18:25.421 --> 18:26.737
Are you done?

18:26.772 --> 18:29.573
Yes, I am.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.967
Good, because I ran
a DNA screening

18:32.003 --> 18:34.123
and a background check,
and I know you thought

18:34.155 --> 18:35.830
she was everything
she said she was,

18:35.865 --> 18:37.273
and you were right.

18:37.308 --> 18:39.250
It's all true.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.801
Abby is your cousin.

18:40.836 --> 18:42.720
She did grow up in Evanston,

18:42.755 --> 18:43.830
she did earn
a scholarship to Howard,

18:43.865 --> 18:47.141
and believe it or not,
she spent all of last night

18:47.176 --> 18:49.376
applying for a card at
the Library of Congress.

18:49.412 --> 18:52.246
What a nerd.

18:52.281 --> 18:54.565
Hey.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.576
That's my niece
you're talking about.

18:56.611 --> 18:58.571
And I know
she's dying to meet you.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.753
Hey, Ernie.

19:07.788 --> 19:09.463
How'd you know it was me?

19:09.498 --> 19:11.598
I could smell you coming.

19:11.634 --> 19:14.427
But I took five showers.

19:14.462 --> 19:17.379
Have you considered
taking a bath?

19:17.414 --> 19:21.475
Oh, no. Standing water
is no longer my friend.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.886
Maybe you need some new friends,

19:23.921 --> 19:26.163
like a bar of soap
and a good, sturdy sponge.

19:26.198 --> 19:28.641
Okay, enough is enough.

19:28.676 --> 19:31.051
I know you love
having power over me,

19:31.086 --> 19:32.486
because I let it slip about
Marisa knowing we're spies,

19:32.521 --> 19:34.888
but Marisa can be trusted,

19:34.924 --> 19:36.999
and trust is something
you earn, Judy.

19:37.034 --> 19:38.550
You don't just blackmail
your way into it.

19:38.585 --> 19:40.569
So fine, just tell Mom.

19:40.604 --> 19:42.830
Please. If I was going
to tell her,

19:42.865 --> 19:44.248
I would've told her months ago.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.225
You already knew?

19:46.260 --> 19:48.177
So you did all this
just to mess with me?

19:48.212 --> 19:50.687
Yep. By the way,
the mission in the sewer?

19:50.723 --> 19:52.790
Made it up.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.708
That sewer was gross
and disgusting.

19:54.744 --> 19:57.019
That was the plan.

19:57.054 --> 20:00.623
Well, glad I got rid
of those nasty, stinky clothes.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.149
Where'd you put 'em?

20:04.228 --> 20:06.111
Sweet dreams.

20:10.217 --> 20:13.051
Thank you so much
for letting me come over.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.478
It means a lot, Ms. Cooper.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.888
Oh, please, call me Kira.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.783
Or Aunt Kira. If you want.

20:18.818 --> 20:19.958
You don't have to.
You know what?

20:19.994 --> 20:22.027
Whatever makes you comfortable.

20:22.063 --> 20:24.213
Thanks, Aunt Kira.

20:24.248 --> 20:26.056
Oh, come here.

20:26.091 --> 20:29.551
This is such a beautiful moment.

20:29.586 --> 20:30.811
Let's not forget, this would
not have been possible

20:30.846 --> 20:33.255
if it weren't for me.

20:33.290 --> 20:35.248
Oh, the gift. Give her the gift.

20:35.284 --> 20:37.401
Right. Okay, Abby.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.370
We have a little
present for you.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.214
Thank you.

20:42.249 --> 20:44.299
Actually,
it's a family heirloom.

20:44.334 --> 20:45.814
And since you're
part of the family...

20:47.571 --> 20:48.979
What a beautiful locket.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.531
Open it.

20:56.705 --> 21:00.141
Is this picture of...

21:00.176 --> 21:02.251
I can't believe it.

21:02.286 --> 21:03.560
I can't believe
I'm looking at my mother.

21:03.596 --> 21:07.172
We figured that since
your mom's gone,

21:07.208 --> 21:09.516
this would be
the next best thing.

21:09.551 --> 21:12.052
You don't know how many nights

21:12.088 --> 21:14.529
I laid in bed as a little girl

21:14.565 --> 21:17.433
just wondering...
what was she like.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.495
Do I look like her?

21:21.530 --> 21:24.648
Do I have her smile?

21:24.683 --> 21:28.444
And now, I'm actually
looking at my mother's face.

21:31.765 --> 21:34.533
Abby...

21:34.568 --> 21:36.661
she's not gone.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.787
I'm sorry, what?

21:38.823 --> 21:40.898
- She's alive.
- What?

21:40.933 --> 21:42.853
She's alive, and I know
where she is.

21:44.862 --> 21:47.312
I'm sorry, you know
where she is?

21:47.348 --> 21:49.023
Mom, this whole time,
you said that...

21:49.058 --> 21:50.273
I know what I said.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.210
But I didn't say what I know.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.988
Sweetie, let me explain
something.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.707
Listen very closely.

21:58.742 --> 22:00.934
I've secretly been in contact
with your mother, Abby.

22:00.970 --> 22:04.037
<i>She's alive and in hiding.</i>

22:04.073 --> 22:06.415
It's all falling into place.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.476
After all this time,

22:09.512 --> 22:12.237
Kira Cooper's gonna lead us
straight to her sister.

22:15.526 --> 22:17.959
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
