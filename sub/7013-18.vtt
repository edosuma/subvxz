00:03.040 --> 00:06.440
So, Hyde, big job fair tomorrow.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.880
Oh, and you're in luck,
'cause I read that corporate America...

00:08.960 --> 00:13.040
is experiencing a severe shortage
of paranoid conspiracy nuts.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.880
I'm not a conspiracy nut, okay?

00:16.920 --> 00:18.840
My history, shop and gym teachers...

00:18.920 --> 00:21.680
secretly started that rumor
to discredit me.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.360
I do need a job though
since the Fotohut shut down.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.400
And I'm never gonna get my pictures back,
which is a real shame...

00:27.480 --> 00:31.200
'cause they'll never let me
under the bleachers anymore.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.640
You need a job too, Eric...

00:34.720 --> 00:39.040
since you just got fired from
your last job by your own daddy.

00:39.120 --> 00:43.200
Well, at least my daddy's
not in jail for bribery.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.160
Okay. So get this.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.120
The radio station I work at...

00:47.200 --> 00:49.920
wants me to work
their job-fair booth as "Hot Donna."

00:50.000 --> 00:54.120
All right? As if I'm some object
for guys to leer at. God.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.000
- Oh, my God! Spank me!
- Oh, mama!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.560
I guess being beautiful
has its benefits.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.560
Hey, shut up.
I'm embarrassed.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.880
I'm talkin' about me, Donna.

01:08.960 --> 01:12.240
And the best thing about being beautiful
is I can get work as a model.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.760
So I don't have to go to the job fair
like the rest of you "uggos."

01:15.840 --> 01:17.680
Well, I cannot wait.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.160
Nina will be at the D.M.V. Booth,
which means that Fez...

01:20.240 --> 01:23.400
will be making out
during a school day.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.880
How many of you suckers have
made out during a school day?

01:28.400 --> 01:31.720
How many of you suckers have made out
during a school day in the nude?

01:34.240 --> 01:36.160
Then I will be nude.

01:39.920 --> 01:42.800
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

01:42.880 --> 01:46.200
I got startled, 'cause I caught a glimpse
of myself in the mirror.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.800
I'm so handsome, I thought Shaun Cassidy
was sitting in the backseat.

01:51.280 --> 01:54.040
Yes. You are a beautiful
male specimen.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.320
Except you have a gray hair.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.240
What?

02:00.320 --> 02:02.400
No, I don't-

02:42.840 --> 02:45.000
All right, Eric.
Listen up.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.440
You know how your mother and I feel
about you and Donna getting engaged.

02:48.480 --> 02:51.360
But since you won't listen to reason,
I've come to a decision.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.840
If you don't cancel
this engagement...

02:53.920 --> 02:55.840
I'm not paying for your college.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.760
What?

02:57.840 --> 03:00.840
Because he loves you.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.760
No, he doesn't.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.000
Yes, he does.
He's full of love.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.200
But it's buried, just like treasure.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.640
- Dad, how could you do this?
- Oh, it's easy.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.120
Instead of giving $4,000
to a college...

03:20.160 --> 03:22.600
I leave my checkbook in the drawer,
count my money...

03:22.680 --> 03:25.240
and laugh like a little girl.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.720
Fine.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.960
- He laughs because he loves you!

Where did you learn

Korea.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.360
Kitty, I am right about this.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.160
Red, you can't just force people
to do what you want.

03:48.200 --> 03:52.320
Oh, see, that's one of those things
that people say that's just not true.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.920
Like, "There's no place like home."

03:57.640 --> 04:00.880
Hell, I can think of
a hundred places better than this.

04:03.040 --> 04:07.160
- I cannot believe you hit a police car.
<i>- [Car Door Opens]</i>

04:07.240 --> 04:10.600
Now, don't worry.
It's a hot lady cop.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.200
[Sighs]
Just watch the master.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.839
License and registration.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.160
Yeah. Just give me a sec here.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.840
[Grunts] My wallet gets stuck,
'cause I've been working out.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.480
My leg muscles are huge.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.240
Oh, boy. By the way,
I can bench about 220...

04:33.280 --> 04:36.400
so that'd be about
two of you, little lady.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.040
What's your name?

04:39.120 --> 04:41.560
Oh, my name is Fez,
but I have a girlfriend...

04:41.640 --> 04:44.040
so you need to cool it, little girl.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.440
Yeah. I'll try.

04:48.480 --> 04:51.000
Okay, Mr. Kelso.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.200
I'm gonna issue you a citation.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.120
Oh, a citation for being
too foxy in a school zone?

04:57.200 --> 05:00.200
No. A citation for $64.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.120
Bench-press that.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.960
So if we don't break off the engagement,
Red's not gonna pay for my college.

05:12.040 --> 05:15.080
You know, maybe this is it, Eric.
Maybe Red won.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.600
No. No, okay?

05:17.680 --> 05:20.720
He's not gonna win.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.320
You know what? I'll just look
for something full-time at the job fair.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.480
- I'll pay for college myself. People do that, right?
- Yeah, people with skills.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.640
- But I mean, you're cute. That's a skill.
- Stop.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.880
How can Red do this to me?

05:36.960 --> 05:39.720
I swear to God,
that man is always mad.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.440
I think the gene for joy
might be stored in hair.

I owe you a geek dollar.
- Yes. Thank you.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.000
Guys, something horrible happened.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.960
Let me tell it.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.080
Kelso tried to charm a lady cop,
and it didn't work.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.320
But she was all over me, boy.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.560

realize looks fade!

I'm not- I'm not gonna be able
to be a model forever!

06:37.920 --> 06:40.320
I'm gonna have to get
a practical, realistic job...

06:40.400 --> 06:42.640
like regular, ugly people.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.960
Okay, so what sounds better-
wide receiver or spy?

06:48.040 --> 06:51.800
Well, Kelso, I don't see why you
couldn't just do both.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.440
You're right.
It's the perfect cover.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.080
How many of you suckers have

an engaged hophead
and a mush-mouthed foreigner...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.520
they're gonna be jumpin' for joy.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.760
Wait a minute.
Am I the pretty-boy moron?

08:25.840 --> 08:28.640
- Yes.
- Cool, 'cause that's the best one.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.600
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:35.679 --> 08:38.080
- So, you're ready for the big job search?
- Yup.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.080
I got my résumé,
my very best blazer...

08:40.159 --> 08:42.679
and a really charming story
about how my biggest fault...

08:42.760 --> 08:45.800
is that I just work
too darn hard, so-

08:45.880 --> 08:49.200
- How 'bout you?
- I don't know. This is so humiliating.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.200
I mean, I have a brain, you know.

2,000 records sorted

08:53.280 --> 08:55.200
I didn't do that with my boobs.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.520
That'd be a neat trick though.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.880
I've always been fascinated by the veterinary
sciences. Do you have any jobs available?

09:06.960 --> 09:11.480
Yes. We need someone to usher our
four-legged friends into the next life.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.680
All right. That sounds fantastic.
And how do I do that?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.880
You shovel the carcass
into the furnace.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.800
I've always been fascinated

09:20.880 --> 09:24.160

09:27.880 --> 09:31.640
In that case, you gotta shoot it.
You're the "triggerman."

10:42.080 --> 10:45.480

you can sell anything.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.440
Uh, thanks, but no, thanks.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.360

- Did you hear him?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.960

the more you earn"?

10:59.040 --> 11:02.760
The more you sleep, the more you earn.
That's my job.

Damn, woman!

11:08.120 --> 11:11.360
So, Nina, after walking
around the job fair...

11:11.440 --> 11:13.720
and hearing the word "job" a lot...

11:20.840 --> 11:22.760
it gave me needs.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.920
No. We're at a job fair.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.880
Please don't say that word.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.720
I can't go far from my booth.
It's my job.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.800
[Whispers]
Stop it.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.360
Hi.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.560
One of your officers
recently issued me a ticket.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.920
- My name is Michael Kelso.
- Michael Kelso.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.320
Wait a minute.
Officer Debbie?

11:48.400 --> 11:51.920
Oh, my God!
What happened to you?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.200
You're like your own ugly sister!

11:55.280 --> 11:57.120
What do you want, Mr. Kelso?

11:57.200 --> 11:59.640
What do I want? I want to know how
one minute you're all "waa-waa"...

11:59.720 --> 12:03.200
and the next you're all-
[Imitates Klaxon Blaring]

12:03.280 --> 12:05.280
- Good cripes!
- Hey, now-

12:05.360 --> 12:08.960
I'm just saying, in your uniform
you were, like, a totally hot police chick...

12:09.040 --> 12:11.920
but out of your uniform
you're a total pie face.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.040
I mean, good God!

12:15.520 --> 12:17.400
Wait a minute.

12:17.440 --> 12:20.960
It's, like, you got all your charisma
from your uniform.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.840
What is happening to you?
Are you having a stroke? What?

12:25.920 --> 12:29.280
No, that's just how I look
when I have an idea.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.560
To Eddie.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.880
Love, Hot Donna.

12:40.280 --> 12:43.120
Hot Donna has now signed 87 guys!

12:44.320 --> 12:46.880
And two girls.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.400
It's, like, who knew,
in our little town?

12:49.480 --> 12:51.440
Well, I can see you...

12:51.520 --> 12:54.280
got over your little
bout of shyness.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.840
Well, what the hell? They think I'm hot.
And you know what?

12:56.920 --> 13:01.040
- Hot Donna rules!
- [Whooping]

13:01.120 --> 13:05.040
So, great news.
I got a job at First Midwestern Bank.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.920
Oh, my God! Eric.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.360
I know. And they have
branches all over Wisconsin.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.640
So wherever you go to school,
I'll have a job.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.600
I'll save some money.
I can start school, like, a year after you.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.320
And I don't even have to
slaughter animals.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.240
Was that ever an option?

13:22.320 --> 13:26.160
Ah, apparently it's the invisible industry
of Point Place, yeah.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.720
I'm actually surprised the streets
aren't running red with blood.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.560
Well, Steven,
it is obvious you don't want a job.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.320
No. I was just holding out for one
that has a cash register...

13:37.400 --> 13:40.080
with a lock that's very,
very easy to jimmy.

13:40.160 --> 13:44.000
- Oh, God! Excuse me.
- Oh, it's okay. I probably deserved it.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.840
- Roy.
- Steven?

13:48.920 --> 13:50.800
Hey, man.
Long time no see.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.800
When my dad left, my mom signed me up
for the Big Brother program, and I got Roy.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.720
We had some good times
before you left town.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.280
- Yeah, and moved in with a wonderful woman.
- Oh. What happened?

13:59.360 --> 14:02.640
She found out I was livin' there.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.400
Roy has some problems with people.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.440
They don't like me. Yeah.
You don't like me, right?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.880
Not really.

14:15.560 --> 14:19.440
But to be fair, I have
very high standards.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.000
Yeah?
She's really nice, Steven.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.200
Hey, so what are you doing here?

14:25.280 --> 14:27.720
I work here.
Hotel kitchen manager.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.600
I was gonna put out word
that we were lookin' for a cook...

14:30.680 --> 14:32.560
but then I figured, why bother?

14:32.640 --> 14:34.760
They'll just leave me
like everybody else.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.680
So, Roy, seem a little
depressed there.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.440
Yeah, I'm teetering on the brink.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.680
Maybe I can do something
to cheer you up.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.000
Really?

14:49.080 --> 14:51.160
Oh, that'd be great.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.440
[Sobbing]

14:55.520 --> 14:57.880
So I'm on the Golden Gate Bridge...

14:57.960 --> 15:00.840
and everyone's tellin' me to jump.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.360
I was just out for a jog.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.640
Okay, Roy, here's what
I'm gonna do for you.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.800
I'm gonna take that job as cook
and keep you company...

15:13.880 --> 15:15.720
on two conditions-

15:15.800 --> 15:19.320
I'm not gonna work very hard,
and you're gonna have to pay me a lot.

15:19.400 --> 15:24.040
But, man, it'll be a bargain considering
the money you save on hookers and shrinks.

15:26.320 --> 15:30.960
Great. And if it's work-related,
I can call you at home.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.560
Now I have a reason to get a phone.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.160
Steven, you're a chef!
[Gasps]

15:38.240 --> 15:40.920
If you can learn to make those fancy
deviled-egg thingies...

15:41.000 --> 15:43.160
I will lose my frickin' mind!

15:47.800 --> 15:49.680
So, how's the day going?

15:49.760 --> 15:53.840
Well, let's see. I interviewed
15 potential employees-

15:53.920 --> 15:56.280
10 dumb-asses...

15:56.320 --> 15:59.200
four cretins and a mama's boy.

15:59.240 --> 16:02.600
I vote for the mama's boy.
I think they're sweet.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.560
Hey, Dad! Guess what.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.440
I got a job at First Midwestern,
so Donna and I can stay engaged.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.680
I'll work, she'll study. In a few years,
I can pay for my own tuition.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.120
Yea! I win!
[Blows Raspberry]

16:20.000 --> 16:21.840
Great news!

16:21.920 --> 16:24.600
I'm gonna be a cop!

16:29.280 --> 16:31.800
[All Booing]

16:31.840 --> 16:35.040
No. No, listen.
It's perfect for me.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.280
The uniform will keep me looking hot
even when I'm old.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.080
And plus, I love helping people.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.360
No, you love humping people.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.400
Eric, a lot of times
humping <i>/s</i> helping.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.840
So, you're really gonna be a cop?

16:53.920 --> 16:57.040
Well, he did shoot me,
so we know he's good with guns.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.760
And you just know they're gonna
partner him up with a dog.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.280
Actually, you know what?
It's kind of perfect.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.520
He'll get to run through
people's backyards with a stick.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.599
He does that anyway.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.480
The important thing is,
is that I'll be performing...

17:12.560 --> 17:15.000
a very valuable community service.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.240
And plus, I'll be sexy forever.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.880
I mean, just think about it.

17:22.079 --> 17:26.200
Nobody move!
This is a robbery.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.160
Not in my town, dirtbag.

17:31.240 --> 17:35.040
Oh, Officer, not only did you perform
a valuable community service...

17:35.120 --> 17:37.600
you'll be sexy forever!

17:37.680 --> 17:41.520
All in a day's work, ma'am. Let's get you
into something a little more comfortable.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.200
- But I'm already in a bikini.
- I know.

17:50.520 --> 17:54.560
Kelso, you do realize
you'll have to help ugly people too.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.520
Nah-uh.
I'll just leave that for the fat cops.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.120
<i>- [TV: Sports Crowd Cheer/ng]</i>
- Hey.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.440
I just got off the phone
with the bank.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.840
I didn't get the job because
someone gave me a bad reference.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.800
And then I thought to myself...

18:12.880 --> 18:15.480
"Hmm. I've only had one boss-you!"

18:15.560 --> 18:18.120
I can't believe you blackballed
your own son!

18:18.200 --> 18:20.960
As usual, I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.960
So you're not even man enough to admit it?
You know what I think?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.400
You're a bitter, old man
who's so miserable in his life...

18:26.440 --> 18:29.280
that you have to make everyone
else just as miserable as you are!

18:29.320 --> 18:31.400
- You're pathetic!
- Honey.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.840
Your father didn't call
the bank manager. I did.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.800
Mom, please stay out of this.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.200
What was that?

18:40.280 --> 18:43.080
- I gave you the bad reference.
- Oh.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.640
Then, uh-

18:50.040 --> 18:52.280
[Chuckling]
I'm just kidding.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.000
Eric, if you take a bank job
and put off school...

18:59.080 --> 19:03.000
you'll never go to college,
and the bank manager agreed with me.

19:03.080 --> 19:06.040
Plus, I told him
you were bad at math.

19:06.120 --> 19:10.640
So there's no job money
to pay for college...

19:11.920 --> 19:15.480
no money from you guys
to go to college.

19:15.560 --> 19:20.200
Wow. I guess we're really hoping
for that football scholarship, huh?

19:20.280 --> 19:22.160
I have a compromise.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.160
Your father and I
will pay for college...

19:26.240 --> 19:30.560
if you and Donna will agree to just put off
your engagement for one year.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.600
I'm not compromising anything!

19:34.360 --> 19:36.440
He said some hurtful things.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.920
No. I'm sick of being controlled
by both of you guys.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.080
You guys can keep your money,
okay, 'cause guess what!

19:49.160 --> 19:51.040
I don't want it.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.280
Ma'am! Sir!

19:58.360 --> 20:01.200
We got a call about
a domestic disturbance.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.520
Get out of here.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.880
Okay, but if I gotta come back out here,
somebody's going downtown.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.680
Well, quit it.
I'm just practicing.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.960
A-And this is the pantry.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.920
If you ever get really depressed,
it's a good place to go and cry.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.360
Also, it's where
we keep the mustard.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.800
All right. Cool. Well, uh,
I guess I'll see you on Monday.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.720
- Okay!
- [Grunts]

20:31.800 --> 20:34.080
Okay, man. Okay, Roy.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.000
Get off me!

20:36.080 --> 20:40.120
Oh, I almost forgot to show you
the walk-in freezer.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.160
A little privacy, please!
