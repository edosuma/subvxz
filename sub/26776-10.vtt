transporter.

09:37.677 --> 09:39.011
I'm really going to miss it.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.147
That's why I'm
so emotional right now.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.548
- Then what's that thing?

09:42.615 --> 09:44.150
- That is a wall.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.619
It's made of a product
called sheet rock--

09:46.686 --> 09:49.188
- No, next to the wall.

09:49.255 --> 09:53.392
The machine that says
"inter-dimensional transporter."

09:53.459 --> 09:55.194
- That's a...

09:55.261 --> 09:56.595
Brenda, help me.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.364
- Just give them
the machine, Bill.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.699
- Fine.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.667
You can take the inter-
dimensional transporter.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.303
I'll just open one more
dimensional door--

10:04.370 --> 10:05.371
- No, no, no!
- Stop!

10:05.438 --> 10:07.840
- Alright. Okay.
You can take it.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.242
But before you take it,
please don't take it.

10:10.309 --> 10:12.244
- That's enough.
- Step aside.

10:12.311 --> 10:13.946
- Would you like a pair
of silent leather gloves?

10:14.013 --> 10:16.015
Or maybe this
filing cabinet?

10:16.082 --> 10:18.117
It's not silent,
but it does hold things.

10:25.091 --> 10:29.161
- Pppssshhhh.

10:29.228 --> 10:32.164
Hey! Where'd you get
that King Cupcake?!

10:32.231 --> 10:33.566
Ned said they were out!

10:33.632 --> 10:35.501
- Oh, it's not mine, it's--

10:35.568 --> 10:37.903
- Brandon!
That's mine--give it!

10:40.473 --> 10:43.009
- What?

10:43.075 --> 10:44.343
- How old's yours?

10:44.410 --> 10:45.511
- Forty-two.

10:45.578 --> 10:49.115
- Ooof.
Tough age.

10:49.181 --> 10:50.750
- Alright, up ya go.
- Get up ya weirdo.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.052
- There ya go.
- Let's go. C'mon. Easy.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.323
- Thank you
for helping me.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.826
You fools!

11:00.893 --> 11:03.295
- Is something
supposed to happen?

11:03.362 --> 11:05.998
- Yes.

11:06.065 --> 11:07.933
Usually smoke comes
out of my hand

11:08.000 --> 11:09.969
and then you bear
the mark of Ryker

11:10.036 --> 11:11.537
and I can control
your mind.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.939
- Hm. Is he controlling
your mind, dude?

11:14.006 --> 11:16.609
- Nah. I'm just thinkin'
about cheese fries.

11:16.675 --> 11:17.910
- Now I'm thinkin'
about cheese fries.

11:17.977 --> 11:20.446
- Whoa!
I'm controlling your mind!

11:20.513 --> 11:22.048
- Whhaatt?

11:22.114 --> 11:24.683
- The cheese fries in your mind
are now covered in chili.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.319
- Now they are!!!

11:27.386 --> 11:28.487
- You mock me.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.156
- Yeah,
we definitely mock you.

11:30.222 --> 11:33.793
- Then taste my steel!

11:33.859 --> 11:36.328
Ahh!

11:36.395 --> 11:39.165
- He said,
"taste my steel!"

11:39.231 --> 11:42.068
- Hey, what's
your dill, pickle?

11:42.134 --> 11:43.502
Why are you so mad?

11:43.569 --> 11:46.372
- You'd be mad too if
someone stole your kingdom.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.840
- Huh?
- What's up big dog?

11:47.907 --> 11:51.844
- I am the rightful
ruler of Astoria.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.181
But my throne was
taken away from me.

11:55.247 --> 11:59.185
- Aw, buddy...
- That's not gooood.

11:59.251 --> 12:01.587
- I almost got it back,

12:01.654 --> 12:04.757
but I was defeated
by a squad of knights.

12:04.824 --> 12:07.226
And a wizard banished
me from my realm,

12:07.293 --> 12:10.963
and suddenly I was...
well, here...

12:11.030 --> 12:12.398
- Gah...

12:12.465 --> 12:13.833
- I get it.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.468
He's not a bad guy,
he's just scared.

12:15.534 --> 12:18.504
- He's just a lost lil' puppy
from another dimension.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.373
- With a sword
and sick face tattoos.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.975
- Come on, pal.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.977
We'll get you home,
little fella.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.278
- I'm bigger
than you are.

12:26.345 --> 12:29.715
- Haha! Sure you are,
little buddy.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.050
You know...in a way,

12:31.117 --> 12:32.751
I'm kind of the king
of this town.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.653
- Oh, god...

12:39.024 --> 12:40.793
- Okay I really want
to ask what you're doing,

12:40.860 --> 12:42.528
but I don't want you
to roll your eyes and sigh.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.697
- [ sighs ]

12:44.763 --> 12:46.899
- Yeah. Like that.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.535
- Ray and Henry want
to send that angry knight

12:49.602 --> 12:51.704
back to a land
called Astoria.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.806
So I'm scanning around
different dimensions,

12:53.873 --> 12:58.177
listening for anyone
who says the word Astoria.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.512
- Hmm, any luck?

12:59.578 --> 13:01.147
- Nah...
just a bunch of people

13:01.213 --> 13:03.382
wondering if you
and Henry are dating.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.284
- What?! We're not dating.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.753
- Ohhhhh...

13:07.820 --> 13:11.056
that's not
what I heeeeaaar...

13:11.123 --> 13:13.659
- Hey Char, we got
another Task Bunny job.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.027
Let's bounce!

13:15.094 --> 13:17.029
- No! We're not
real Task Bunnies

13:17.096 --> 13:19.064
and I hate this
stupid outfit.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.900
- But I signed
us up for real.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.768
Some lady is gonna
pay us 200 bucks

13:22.835 --> 13:24.203
to paint
her dog's nails.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.538
- Let's bounce!

13:25.604 --> 13:28.474
- Oohh. Oohh.
Oh no no no!

13:28.541 --> 13:31.177
Helllp meee!

13:35.181 --> 13:36.582
- Hey man,
it's just the tubes.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.051
Okay? You don't have
to be so scared.

13:39.118 --> 13:42.321
- I wasn't scared!
That was um...

13:42.388 --> 13:44.390
brave screaming.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.592
- Oh okay.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.027
- Dude, you were so scared,

13:48.093 --> 13:49.428
I could hear you screaming
the whole way down.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.796
- That was brave screaming!

13:50.863 --> 13:52.898
- Yea no, I also
scream "help me"

13:52.965 --> 13:54.800
when I'm being brave.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.535
- I would like to go home now

13:56.602 --> 13:57.870
and fight for my throne!

13:57.937 --> 13:59.605
- Yeah, where are we
on that, Schwoz?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.307
- I'm still working on it.

14:02.741 --> 14:05.044
- Nice troll slave.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.478
How much do
you want for him?

14:06.545 --> 14:08.747
- What?!
I'm not a troll.

14:08.814 --> 14:10.749
- Quiet down, troll.

14:10.816 --> 14:12.484
Hey, hey, hey...
- What, what, what...

14:12.551 --> 14:14.853
- Let's give this dude
some of our sweet weapons

14:14.920 --> 14:17.723
to take home with him so he can
get his kingdom back!

14:17.790 --> 14:19.658
- I love that

14:19.725 --> 14:21.860
and I would like
to do that right now.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.963
- You have weapons here?

14:24.029 --> 14:25.764
- So many weapons.
- Yeah.

14:25.831 --> 14:28.334
- What,
like swords and axes?

14:28.400 --> 14:31.003
- Yeah yeah, swords!
- Ha ha ha.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.338
- Yeah, we got axes!

14:32.404 --> 14:34.840
Okay Mike Tyson!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

14:34.907 --> 14:36.408
Hey uhh...
let me tell you

14:36.475 --> 14:37.676
about a little something

14:37.743 --> 14:40.045
called a "thermonuclear
hand cannon."

14:40.112 --> 14:41.614
And after that,
I'm gonna tell you

14:41.680 --> 14:45.718
a hilarious story about me,
my cousin, a kangaroo...

14:45.784 --> 14:47.519
- I found it!

14:47.586 --> 14:48.854
I found someone
saying Astoria!

14:48.921 --> 14:50.789
I found someone saying--

14:50.856 --> 14:52.958
ahhh I'm talking to myself.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.327
[ echoing voices ]
- Astoria...

14:58.097 --> 14:59.898
- If you say
it over and over again,

14:59.965 --> 15:02.067
the word "Astoria"
starts to sound weird.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.903
- Works the same
with the word "stromboli."

15:04.970 --> 15:07.206
Stromboli.
- Stromboli.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.841
- Stromboli.
- This sounds weird.

15:08.907 --> 15:10.743
- Stromboli.
- Stromboli.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.544
Strombo-my god,
where are we?!

15:12.611 --> 15:13.912
- Welcome to the Man Cave!

15:13.979 --> 15:15.547
- Ohhh
it's an evil troll!

15:15.614 --> 15:17.049
- I am Schwoz.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.584
- It's an evil troll
named Schwoz!

15:18.651 --> 15:20.853
- Okay why don't you just relax
and let me explain how--

15:20.919 --> 15:23.922
Oh good you have weapons.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.227
- Let us out of this cave!
- Why did you bring us here?

15:28.294 --> 15:29.762
- You better send us
home right now!

15:29.828 --> 15:32.031
- This is my personal space.
- Wait!

15:32.097 --> 15:33.532
I'm pretty sure
that if you tickle trolls

15:33.599 --> 15:34.933
they puke gold.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.269
- No we don't.
I mean no they don't.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.538
- I'll grab him.
- I'll get the treasure.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.739
I'm great at tickling!

15:40.806 --> 15:42.441
- Ahh!

15:44.810 --> 15:46.111
[ laughing ]

15:46.178 --> 15:47.746
- Don't go there dude,
don't go there.

15:47.813 --> 15:49.682
- Anyway, you pull the pin, you
throw it at your enemy...boom.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.383
- Yea but, dude...listen
there's a lot of splatter--

15:51.450 --> 15:54.853
[ laughing ]

15:54.920 --> 15:56.155
- Hey!
- Whoa!

15:56.221 --> 15:58.057
- Who are you?
- Ayyy.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.892
What are you doing
with my troll?

15:59.958 --> 16:01.627
- Arc!
- Ryker!

16:01.694 --> 16:03.262
- Ciara!
- Schwoz?

16:03.329 --> 16:04.396
- Hi!

16:04.463 --> 16:07.099
- And Captain Man
as "the hero".

16:08.967 --> 16:10.169
- Hang on a second.
You know these guys?

16:10.235 --> 16:11.270
- Yes!

16:11.337 --> 16:14.440
They took my
kingdom from me!

16:14.506 --> 16:17.509
- How dare you do that
to this sweet man?!

16:17.576 --> 16:20.879
- Sweet? He enslaved
everyone in the kingdom!

16:20.946 --> 16:22.181
- Then used mind control

16:22.247 --> 16:23.949
to turn my own
sister against me.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.018
- They're making you
sound pretty baaad, dude.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.686
- Oh I am bad.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.822
- Ooooh...Wait what?

16:29.888 --> 16:32.358
- Wait hold on.
Bad like bad bad?

16:32.424 --> 16:36.929
Or bad like
"I'm a bad mamma jamma"?

16:36.995 --> 16:38.897
- Whatever bad means evil.

16:38.964 --> 16:40.399
- What?!

16:40.466 --> 16:41.934
- You're evil?!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.303
- Oh yeah.
Aren't you guys evil?

16:44.370 --> 16:45.938
- No!
- We're good guys!

16:46.004 --> 16:47.439
Why would you
think we're evil?!

16:47.506 --> 16:49.475
- Uh...'cause you've got
this underground lair,

16:49.541 --> 16:51.844
tons of weapons,
and a troll slave?

16:51.910 --> 16:54.646
- I'm not a troll!

16:54.713 --> 16:56.882
- Ahh...Haha!

16:56.949 --> 16:58.250
I see what happened here.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.819
Classic misunderstanding.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.788
Sooo...

17:02.855 --> 17:05.190
Gonna need those weapons
back real quick.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.029
- Pretty firm grip, dude.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.731
- Tell you what...

17:12.798 --> 17:13.999
on the count of three

17:14.066 --> 17:16.001
you're just gonna let go
and give those--

17:23.642 --> 17:24.877
- Get ready to suffer.

17:24.943 --> 17:26.211
- How?

17:26.278 --> 17:28.280
You gonna finish telling
me that boring story

17:28.347 --> 17:30.716
about your mom and that
clown she was dating?

17:30.783 --> 17:32.551
- It was my aunt.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.686
And I'm not sure
if they were dating.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.462
- What are you doing?
We should help him!

17:43.529 --> 17:46.031
- No. He insulted
Captain Man's story.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.367
Now it's personal.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.440
So, uh...you
and your boyfriend

17:54.506 --> 17:56.208
go into different
dimensions a lot, or?

17:56.275 --> 17:57.476
- Oh, we're not...

17:57.543 --> 18:00.779
- He's not my boyfriend.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.581
- Nice.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.822
I don't know if they
have music in your dimension,

18:09.888 --> 18:12.524
but I'm in a band.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.625
- You know your friend's

18:13.692 --> 18:16.495
getting beat up
pretty bad, right?

18:16.562 --> 18:18.430
- Alright you got me--
I'm not in a band.

18:18.497 --> 18:21.633
But uh, I'm thinkin'
about joining one...

18:21.700 --> 18:24.236
as the star.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.504
- Hey check it out.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.172
I just stole
the troll's wallet.

18:27.239 --> 18:29.708
- Hey! Give that back!

18:29.775 --> 18:31.343
- Arc, can you stop
stealing for one second?

18:31.410 --> 18:34.613
- I can't help it.
It's my thing.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.718
- Getting tired?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.420
- I'm just
gettin' started.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.122
- Uh-oh.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.457
He always says
"I'm just gettin' started"

18:45.524 --> 18:46.792
right before he's
about to collapse.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.627
I gotta go.
- Let us help!

18:48.694 --> 18:51.163
- Yeah! We're knights!
In training.

18:59.671 --> 19:00.873
- You're a thief, right?

19:00.939 --> 19:03.075
- Okay, you got me.
I stole your wallet too.

19:03.141 --> 19:04.676
- What? No.
- Oh.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.578
- Yeah give me back my wallet.
Never steal from me again.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.313
- I just told you,
it's kind of my thing.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.115
- Listen, I got an idea!

19:13.986 --> 19:15.454
- Wait...

19:15.521 --> 19:16.955
Did you just say,
"time out?"

19:17.022 --> 19:18.357
I mean, I don't
need one, myself,

19:18.423 --> 19:21.260
but if you want to
take five I'll let ya.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.395
- Ahh!
- Arrr!

19:23.462 --> 19:25.998
- Oh wait wait!
I don't need help.

19:26.064 --> 19:29.134
But if you want
to help me, I'll let ya.

19:46.084 --> 19:47.686
- Schwoz, get
the elevator button!

19:52.758 --> 19:53.759
- Oh my God!

19:53.825 --> 19:55.761
- Get out of the elevator!

19:59.097 --> 20:00.365
Did you get the pin?

20:00.432 --> 20:01.934
- Oh I got all ten!

20:02.000 --> 20:03.168
- I said just get one!

20:03.235 --> 20:05.771
- No I know...
I really hate Ryker.

20:05.837 --> 20:09.041
Plus it looks neat
with one on each finger.

20:09.107 --> 20:11.009
- Hey, Ryker!

20:11.076 --> 20:13.879
Your story's boring.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.815
- What? I wasn't
telling a story.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.450
[ boom ]

20:22.120 --> 20:26.091
[ coughing ]

20:26.158 --> 20:28.327
- Ohhhhh!
- Yaaaaaahh!

20:28.393 --> 20:29.428
- Gross!
- Noooo!

20:29.494 --> 20:30.429
- That does not look right.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.130
- Burned mamma jamma.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.702
Nice job Henry.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.739
- Who's Henry?

20:43.041 --> 20:45.110
- So now I'm in the truck

20:45.177 --> 20:47.212
with the clown,
my aunt,

20:47.279 --> 20:48.914
the kangaroo,
and my cousin.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.616
And we're on our way back
to the bowling alley,

20:50.682 --> 20:51.583
when we realize...

20:51.650 --> 20:53.085
- The portal is about to open!

20:53.151 --> 20:55.454
- Yessss!!
- Oh, thank god...

20:55.520 --> 20:57.889
- Wait, aren't you taking
this guy with you?

20:57.956 --> 21:00.158
- Uh, no.
- No way.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.393
- Well what should
we do with him?

21:01.460 --> 21:02.961
- Don't care.
- Anything.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.663
- Your dimension is weird.
- Good luck with your band!

21:04.730 --> 21:06.965
- Hey, I never
got your number...

21:07.032 --> 21:09.835
- Uhhh, four?

21:13.705 --> 21:17.075
- That number does
not help me!

21:17.142 --> 21:19.645
- Still got it, though.
- Yeah.

21:19.711 --> 21:22.614
- So I was
in high school, yea?

21:22.681 --> 21:24.416
- Hey, you guys want to go
upstairs and do anything else?

21:24.483 --> 21:26.184
- Yes! Sounds like a plan.
- Absolutely.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.220
- I love anything else.

21:28.286 --> 21:31.056
- Hey! Who's gonna
hear my story?!

21:31.123 --> 21:34.026
- Uhhhhh, him!

21:34.092 --> 21:35.827
Byeeee...

21:47.272 --> 21:49.741
- So I was in
high school, right?

21:49.808 --> 21:51.810
And my aunt,
she met this clown.

21:51.877 --> 21:54.112
Now I don't know if
they were dating or not,

21:54.179 --> 21:55.514
I didn't ask questions.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.815
But something was
definitely going on

21:56.882 --> 21:59.618
cause they had...
a connection.
