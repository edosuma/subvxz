NARRATOR:
Previously:

00:04.630 --> 00:09.009
Take your brother outside as fast
as you can! Now, Dean, Go!

00:10.678 --> 00:12.304
Mary, no!

00:14.765 --> 00:16.142
Dad's on a hunting trip.

00:17.226 --> 00:19.228
And he hasn't been home
in a few days.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.896
Jess, excuse us.

00:23.315 --> 00:26.819
-I swore I was done hunting. For good.
-I can't do this alone.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.989
Now you're taking off in the middle
of the night to spend the weekend?

00:30.239 --> 00:34.326
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.
I promise.

00:35.828 --> 00:39.039
SAM: Think Mom wanted this for us?
Dean, we were raised like warriors.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.251
-You have a responsibility.
SAM: To Dad? And his crusade?

00:42.460 --> 00:46.005
Even if we do find the thing
that killed her...

00:46.088 --> 00:48.007
...Mom's gone and she isn't coming back.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.593
Don't talk about her like that.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.889
DEAN: Dad's gone. I've got his journal.
He left me a message.

00:55.097 --> 00:57.099
SAM: These coordinates he left us,
it's weird, man.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.810
Hey, Dean?
What I said earlier, I'm sorry--

01:00.895 --> 01:03.105
No chick-flick moments.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.483
SAM:
Jess?

01:14.283 --> 01:16.118
No!

01:26.712 --> 01:29.173
We got work to do.

01:48.859 --> 01:53.656
(GROWLING)

02:07.419 --> 02:11.340
-Dude, you're cheating.
-Nope, you just suck.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.599
Hey, Haley. Day six.
We're still out near Blackwater Ridge.

02:20.808 --> 02:24.895
We're fine, keeping safe.
So don't worry. Talk to you tomorrow.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.407
Hey, where you going?
My moment of victory.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.617
Nature calls.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.222

Brad.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.622
Gary, what's going on?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.886
(GROWLING)

03:39.303 --> 03:41.597
(GARY SCREAMING)

04:41.949 --> 04:43.993
I, um....

04:45.202 --> 04:47.830
You always said roses were lame.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.208
So I brought you, uh....

05:05.806 --> 05:07.474
Jess....

05:07.975 --> 05:10.144
Oh, God.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.983
I should have protected you.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.402
I should have told you the truth.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.119
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

05:35.502 --> 05:39.131
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.508
Another nightmare?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.177
(CLEARING THROAT)

05:46.889 --> 05:48.057
Wanna drive for a while?

05:50.893 --> 05:54.063
Dean, your whole life,
you never once asked me that.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.691
Just thought you might want to.
Never mind.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.444
Look, man. You're worried about me.

06:00.652 --> 06:04.656
I get it. And thank you,
but I'm perfectly okay.

06:04.907 --> 06:05.949
Uh-huh.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.455
All right, where are we?

06:11.663 --> 06:15.042
We are just outside of Grand Junction.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.423
You know what, maybe we shouldn't
have left Stanford so soon.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.095
Sam, we dug around there for a week.
We came up with nothing.

06:26.345 --> 06:30.349
-If you wanna find what killed Jessica--
-We gotta find Dad first.

06:31.934 --> 06:35.229
Dad disappearing and this thing
showing up again after 20 years...

06:35.437 --> 06:37.981
...it's no coincidence.
Dad will have answers.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.026
-He'll know what to do.
-It's weird, man.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.738
These coordinates he left us,
this Blackwater Ridge....

06:44.947 --> 06:47.866
-Yeah, what about it?
-There's nothing there.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.868
It's just woods.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.289
Why is he sending us
to the middle of nowhere?

07:01.964 --> 07:06.051
So Blackwater Ridge is pretty remote.
It's cut off by these canyons here.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.347
Rough terrain, dense forest, abandoned
silver and gold mines all over the place.

07:10.556 --> 07:13.350
Dude, check out the size
of this frigging bear.

07:15.978 --> 07:19.982
And a dozen or more grizzlies
in the area.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.776
It's no nature hike, that's for sure.

07:22.985 --> 07:26.905
You boys aren't planning to go out
near Blackwater Ridge by any chance?

07:27.114 --> 07:30.325
Oh, no, sir. We're environmental-study
majors from UC Boulder.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.912
-Just working on a paper.
-Recycle, man.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.914
Bull.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.417
You're friends
with that Haley girl, right?

07:40.169 --> 07:42.838
Yes. Yes, we are...

07:43.046 --> 07:44.882
...Ranger Wilkinson.

07:46.175 --> 07:48.343
Well, I will tell you
exactly what I told her.

07:48.594 --> 07:50.345
Her brother filled out a permit...

07:50.554 --> 07:53.724
...saying he wouldn't be back
from Blackwater until the 24th.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.810
So it's not exactly
a missing persons, now, is it?

07:57.019 --> 07:59.980
Tell that girl to quit worrying.
I'm sure her brother's just fine.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.899
DEAN:
We will.

08:02.149 --> 08:06.069
-That Haley girl's quite a pistol, huh?
-That is putting it mildly.

08:06.278 --> 08:10.574
You know what would help is if I could
show her a copy of that permit.

08:10.782 --> 08:14.119
You know, so she could see
her brother's return date.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.956
Yeah.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.001
-Are you cruising for a hookup?
-What do you mean?

08:21.210 --> 08:23.629
The coordinates point to Blackwater
Ridge. What do we wait for?

08:23.837 --> 08:26.965
Let's just go find Dad.
I mean, why even talk to this girl?

08:27.132 --> 08:31.470
We should know what we're walking
into before we actually walk into it.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.180
What?

08:33.388 --> 08:36.558
Since when are you all
"shoot first, ask questions later" anyway?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.310
Since now.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.189
Oh, really?

08:42.689 --> 08:44.107
(KNOCKING)

08:45.234 --> 08:48.028
You must be Haley Collins.
I'm Dean, this is Sam.

08:48.237 --> 08:51.448
We're rangers with the Park Service.
Ranger Wilkinson sent us over.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.785
We wanted to ask you some questions
about your brother, Tommy.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.162
Let me see some ID.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.251
DEAN:
There you go.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.217
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.096
-That yours?
-Yeah.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.347
Nice car.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.185
(MOUTHING) Oh, my--

09:20.269 --> 09:22.271
SAM: So if Tommy's not due back
for a while...

09:22.521 --> 09:24.189
...how do you know
something's wrong?

09:24.398 --> 09:28.694
He checks in every day by cell.
He e-mails photos, stupid little videos.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.113
But we haven't heard anything
in three days now.

09:31.196 --> 09:35.534
-Well, maybe he can't get cell reception.
-He's got a satellite phone too.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.121
-Could it be he forgot to check in?
-He wouldn't do that.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.209
Our parents are gone.
It's just my two brothers and me.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.379
We all keep pretty close tabs
on each other.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.549
-Can I see the pictures he sent you?
-Yeah.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.843
That's Tommy.

09:59.057 --> 10:02.102
Hey, Haley. Day six.
We're still out near Blackwater Ridge.

10:02.311 --> 10:07.691
We're fine, keeping safe.
So don't worry. Talk to you tomorrow.

10:07.899 --> 10:11.236
DEAN: Well, we'll find your brother.
We're heading out to Blackwater Ridge.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.280
Then maybe I'll see you there.

10:14.656 --> 10:19.036
Look, I can't sit around here anymore,
so I hired a guide.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.164
I'm heading out in the morning
and I'm gonna find Tommy myself.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.124
I think I know how you feel.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.171
Hey, you mind forwarding these
to me?

10:29.254 --> 10:31.298
Sure.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.301
(MUSIC PLAYING)

10:34.760 --> 10:39.306
So Blackwater Ridge doesn't get
a lot of traffic. Local campers mostly.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.809
But still, this past April,
two hikers went missing out there.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.270
-They were never found.
-Any before that?

10:45.479 --> 10:48.815
Yeah. In 1982, eight people
all vanished in the same year.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.068
Authorities said it was a grizzly attack.

10:51.151 --> 10:56.198
And again in 1959.
And again before that in 1936.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.493
Every 23 years, just like clockwork.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.372
Okay, watch this. Here's the clincher.

11:04.331 --> 11:08.543
I downloaded that guy Tommy's video
to the laptop. Check this out.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.214
Do it again.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.427
That's three frames.
It's a fraction of a second.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.347
Whatever that thing is, it can move.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.392
Told you something weird
was going on.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.186
Yeah. I got one more thing.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.399
In '59, one camper survived
the supposed grizzly attack.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.777
Just a kid.
Barely crawled out of the woods alive.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.405
Is there a name?

11:36.863 --> 11:40.367
SHAW: Look, ranger, I don't know why
you're asking me about this.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.745
It's public record. I was a kid.

11:43.995 --> 11:47.499
-My parents got mauled by a--
-Grizzly? That's what attacked them?

11:56.007 --> 11:58.260
The other people
that went missing that year...

11:58.343 --> 12:00.011
...those were bear attacks too?

12:02.681 --> 12:05.600
What about all the people
that went missing this year?

12:06.017 --> 12:07.686
Same thing?

12:09.563 --> 12:13.233
If we knew what we were dealing with,
we might be able to stop it.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.488
I seriously doubt that.

12:18.697 --> 12:23.452
Anyways, I don't see what difference
it would make.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.788
You wouldn't believe me.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.416
Nobody ever did.

12:31.877 --> 12:34.171
Mr. Shaw...

12:36.298 --> 12:38.008
...what did you see?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.931
Nothing.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.269
It moved too fast to see.

12:49.478 --> 12:52.856
It hid too well. I heard it, though.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.192
A roar.

12:56.735 --> 13:01.198
Like no man or animal
I ever heard.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.616
It came at night?

13:04.075 --> 13:06.244
Got inside your tent?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.455
It got inside our cabin.

13:09.414 --> 13:12.876
I was sleeping in front of the fireplace
when it came in.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.630
It didn't smash a window
or break the door...

13:17.839 --> 13:19.466
...it unlocked it.

13:20.634 --> 13:24.513
You know of a bear
that could do something like that?

13:25.222 --> 13:29.226
I didn't even wake up
until I heard my parents screaming.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.354
-It killed them?
SHAW: Dragged them off into the night.

13:35.398 --> 13:39.986
Why it left me alive....
Been asking myself that ever since.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.702
Did leave me this, though.

13:57.170 --> 14:01.675
There's something evil
in those woods.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.638
It was some sort of a demon.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.349
DEAN: Spirits and demons don't have
to unlock doors.

14:09.558 --> 14:13.186
-They just go through the walls.
-So it's probably something corporeal.

14:13.395 --> 14:18.358
-"Corporeal"? Excuse me, professor.
-Shut up. So, what do you think?

14:18.567 --> 14:21.027
The claws, the speed that it moves....

14:21.278 --> 14:23.321
Could be a Skinwalker,
maybe a Black Dog.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.408
Whatever we're talking about,
we're talking about a creature...

14:26.491 --> 14:28.243
...and it's corporeal.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.412
Which means we can kill it.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.639
We cannot let that Haley girl
go out there.

14:49.848 --> 14:53.602
What are we gonna tell her? She can't
go because of a big, scary monster?

14:53.852 --> 14:55.395
SAM:
Yeah.

14:56.438 --> 14:59.608
Her brother's missing, Sam.
She's not just gonna sit this out.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.612
We go with her, and we keep our eyes
peeled for our fuzzy predator friend.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.156
So finding Dad's not enough?

15:08.617 --> 15:10.577
Now we gotta babysit too?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.831
What?

15:15.749 --> 15:17.375
Nothing.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.426
MAN: I'll tell you again,
I don't think Ben should come.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.095
Roy.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.598
Look, you're paying me good money
to keep everybody safe.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.225
I think Ben's safest at home.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.779
You guys got room for two more?

15:46.029 --> 15:48.448
-Wait, you wanna come with us?
ROY: Who are these guys?

15:48.657 --> 15:52.410
Apparently, this is all the Park Service
could muster up for the search.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.621
ROY: You're rangers?
-That's right.

15:54.871 --> 15:58.083
And you're hiking out
in biker boots and jeans?

15:58.875 --> 16:01.002
Well, sweetheart, I don't do shorts.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.382
ROY:
Oh, you think this is funny?

16:05.632 --> 16:08.259
It's dangerous backcountry out there.
Her brother might be hurt.

16:10.387 --> 16:13.264
Believe me,
I know how dangerous it can be.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.476
We just wanna help them
find their brother, that's all.

16:40.458 --> 16:43.712
(GROWLING)

16:57.267 --> 17:02.147
(GARY SCREAMING)

17:16.035 --> 17:18.621
DEAN: So, Roy, you said you did
a little hunting.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.374
ROY: Yeah, more than a little.
DEAN: Uh-huh.

17:22.709 --> 17:27.589
-What kind of furry critters do you hunt?
-Mostly bucks, sometimes bear.

17:28.089 --> 17:32.385
Tell me, Bambi or Yogi
ever hunt you back?

17:36.264 --> 17:37.974
What you doing, Roy?

17:44.272 --> 17:46.691
You should watch
where you're stepping, ranger.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.864
It was a bear trap.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.830
You didn't pack any provisions.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.458
You guys are carrying a duffle bag.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.044
You're not rangers,
so who the hell are you?

18:14.886 --> 18:18.932
Sam and I are brothers,
and we're looking for our father.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.850
He might be here, we don't know.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.478
I just figured you and me,
we're in the same boat.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.148
Why didn't you tell me that
from the start?

18:27.398 --> 18:29.108
I'm telling you now.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.904
Besides, that's probably the most honest
I've ever been with a woman.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.864
Ever.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.116
So we okay?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.956
Yeah. Okay.

18:43.248 --> 18:45.500
And what do you mean,
I didn't pack provisions?

19:02.475 --> 19:05.353
ROY:
This is it. Blackwater Ridge.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.355
SAM:
What coordinates are we at?

19:11.359 --> 19:13.611
Thirty-five at minus 111.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.953
-You hear that?
-Yeah.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.081
Not even crickets.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.333
ROY:
I'm gonna go take a look around.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.961
You shouldn't go off by yourself.

19:30.169 --> 19:34.090
That's sweet. Don't worry about me.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.641
All right, everybody stays together.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.476
Let's go.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.821
ROY:
Haley! Over here!

20:03.578 --> 20:07.540
-Oh, my God.
ROY: Looks like a grizzly.

20:23.806 --> 20:24.974
HALEY:
Tommy?

20:26.768 --> 20:28.102
-Tommy!
SAM: Shh.

20:28.186 --> 20:31.230
-Tommy!
-Shh!

20:31.564 --> 20:34.275
-Why?
-Something might still be out there.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.278
DEAN:
Sam!

20:44.077 --> 20:46.788
The bodies were dragged
from the campsite.

20:47.455 --> 20:51.250
But here, the tracks just vanish.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.169
It's weird.

20:55.213 --> 20:57.090
I'll tell you what...

20:57.674 --> 21:00.426
...it's no Skinwalker or Black Dog.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.909
Hey, he could still be alive.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.249
MAN:
Help!

21:35.253 --> 21:37.714
Help!

21:38.756 --> 21:40.967
Help me!

21:53.271 --> 21:55.982
It seemed like it was coming
from around here, didn't it?

22:02.071 --> 22:03.948
Everybody back to camp.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.289
HALEY:
Our packs.

22:12.290 --> 22:15.293
So much for my GPS
and my satellite phone.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.920
-What the hell's going on?
SAM: It's smart.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.590
It wants to cut us off
so we can't call for help.

22:20.798 --> 22:23.259
You mean someone,
some nutjob out there...

22:23.468 --> 22:24.886
...just stole all our gear?

22:25.094 --> 22:28.765
I need to speak with you
in private.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.400
Okay. Let me see Dad's journal.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.116
All right.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.285
Check that out.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.953
Oh, come on.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.790
Wendigos are in the Minnesota woods
or northern Michigan.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.584
-I've never heard of one this far west.
-Think about it, Dean.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.420
The claws, the way it can
mimic a human voice....

23:01.297 --> 23:03.007
Great.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.842
Well, then this is useless.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.350
We gotta get these people to safety.

23:13.935 --> 23:16.854
All right, listen up. It's time to go.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.066
Things have gotten more complicated.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.235
-What?
ROY: Don't worry.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.320
Whatever's out there,
I think I can handle it.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.281
If you shoot this thing,
you're just gonna make it mad.

23:27.365 --> 23:30.118
-We have to leave. Now.
ROY: One, you're talking nonsense.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.995
-Two, you're in no position to give orders.
-Relax.

23:33.204 --> 23:35.456
SAM: We never should have let you
come out here, all right?

23:35.748 --> 23:38.042
-I'm trying to protect you.
ROY: You, protect me?

23:38.251 --> 23:40.670
I was hunting when your mommy
was still kissing you good night.

23:40.878 --> 23:45.633
Yeah? It's a damn near perfect hunter.
It's smarter than you.

23:46.968 --> 23:51.264
And it's gonna hunt you down unless we
get your stupid, sorry ass out of here.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.225
-You know you're crazy, right?
-Yeah?

23:54.433 --> 23:55.810
-You ever hunt a Wen--?
HALEY: Roy!

23:56.018 --> 23:57.854
DEAN: Chill out.
-Stop.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.439
Stop it. Everybody just stop.

24:01.983 --> 24:05.570
Look, Tommy might still be alive.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.656
And I'm not leaving here without him.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.246
It's getting late.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.208
This thing is a good hunter
in the day...

24:19.417 --> 24:21.878
...but an unbelievable hunter at night.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.046
We'll never beat it, not in the dark.

24:26.299 --> 24:29.302
We need to settle in
and protect ourselves.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.012
How?

24:41.689 --> 24:44.901
HALEY: One more time, that's...?
-Anasazi symbols.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.987
It's for protection.
The Wendigo can't cross over them.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.322
(CHUCKLING)

24:49.822 --> 24:52.450
Nobody likes a skeptic, Roy.

25:02.668 --> 25:06.130
You wanna tell me what's going on
in that freaky head of yours?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.926
-Dean--
-No, you're not fine.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.304
You're like a powder keg, man.
It's not like you.

25:13.471 --> 25:16.515
I'm supposed to be
the belligerent one, remember?

25:20.353 --> 25:22.396
Dad's not here.

25:24.482 --> 25:26.317
I mean, that much we know
for sure, right?

25:26.525 --> 25:30.488
He would have left us a message,
a sign, right?

25:30.780 --> 25:32.949
Yeah, you're probably right.

25:33.908 --> 25:37.495
To tell you the truth, I don't think
Dad's ever been to Lost Creek.

25:38.454 --> 25:42.041
Then let's get these people
back to town and let's hit the road.

25:42.291 --> 25:45.544
Go find Dad.
I mean, why are we still even here?

25:54.470 --> 25:56.472
This is why.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.474
This book.

25:58.683 --> 26:01.143
This is Dad's single
most valuable possession.

26:01.352 --> 26:03.896
Everything he knows
about every evil thing is in here.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.983
And he's passed it on to us.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.444
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

26:11.070 --> 26:14.115
You know, saving people,
hunting things.

26:14.323 --> 26:15.366
The family business.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.454
That makes no sense.

26:20.538 --> 26:23.165
Why--? Why doesn't he just call us?

26:23.374 --> 26:26.585
Why doesn't he tell us what he wants,
tell us where he is?

26:29.088 --> 26:30.589
I don't know.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.802
But the way I see it...

26:35.428 --> 26:38.472
...Dad's given us a job to do,
and I intend to do it.

26:38.806 --> 26:42.601
Dean, no.

26:43.019 --> 26:45.354
I gotta find Dad.

26:45.563 --> 26:48.149
I gotta find Jessica's killer.

26:53.362 --> 26:56.115
-It's the only thing I can think about.
-Okay, all right.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.951
Sam, we'll find them, I promise.

26:59.827 --> 27:03.748
Listen to me.
You've gotta prepare yourself.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.834
I mean, this search could take a while.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.045
And all that anger...

27:09.295 --> 27:13.007
...you can't keep it burning
over the long haul. It's gonna kill you.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.593
You gotta have patience, man.

27:18.262 --> 27:21.891
How do you do it?
How does Dad do it?

27:24.310 --> 27:25.895
Well, for one, them.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.567
I figure our family's so screwed to hell,
maybe we can help some others.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.320
Makes things a little bit
more bearable.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.576
I'll tell you what else helps.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.625
Killing as many evil sons of bitches
as I possibly can.

Roy?

I don't....

29:22.887 --> 29:26.098
I mean, these types of things,
they aren't supposed to be real.

29:26.307 --> 29:28.642
I wish I could tell you different.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.562
How do we know
it's not out there watching us?

29:31.645 --> 29:33.606
We don't.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.441
But we're safe for now.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.444
How do you know about this stuff?

29:41.322 --> 29:43.532
It kind of runs in the family.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.289
Hey.

29:50.831 --> 29:54.251
So we've got half a chance
in the daylight.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.712
And I, for one...

29:56.921 --> 29:59.131
...wanna kill this evil son of a bitch.

30:00.341 --> 30:02.426
Well, hell, you know I'm in.

30:02.510 --> 30:05.554
"Wendigo" is a Cree Indian word.
It means "evil that devours."

30:05.763 --> 30:08.557
They're hundreds of years old.
Each one was once a man.

30:08.641 --> 30:13.437
Sometimes an Indian, or other times
a frontiersman or a miner or a hunter.

30:13.521 --> 30:16.732
-How's a man turn in to one of those?
DEAN: Well, it's always the same.

30:16.941 --> 30:19.693
During some harsh winter,
a guy finds himself starving...

30:19.902 --> 30:21.946
...cut off from supplies or help.

30:22.154 --> 30:26.700
He becomes a cannibal to survive, eating
other members of his tribe or camp.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.911
Like the Donner Party.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.956
Cultures all over the world
believe that eating human flesh...

30:32.164 --> 30:36.001
...gives a person certain abilities:
speed, strength, immortality.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.587
If you eat enough of it, over years...

30:38.671 --> 30:42.716
...you become this
less-than-human thing.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.802
You're always hungry.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.805
So if that's true,
how can Tommy still be alive?

30:50.975 --> 30:53.477
-You're not gonna like it.
-Tell me.

30:53.561 --> 30:56.689
More than anything, a Wendigo knows
how to last long winters without food.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.524
It hibernates for years at a time.

30:58.774 --> 31:02.152
When it's awake,
it keeps its victims alive.

31:02.361 --> 31:06.323
It stores them
so it can feed whenever it wants.

31:07.366 --> 31:12.580
If your brother's alive, it's keeping him
somewhere dark, hidden and safe.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.417
-And we gotta track it back there.
-And then how do we stop it?

31:17.126 --> 31:20.921
Well, guns are useless.
So are knives.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.466
Basically...

31:24.550 --> 31:26.468
...we gotta torch the sucker.

Come on.

38:57.127 --> 38:58.879
Come on.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.762
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

39:13.143 --> 39:14.936
Sam!

39:15.937 --> 39:18.565
Come on. Hurry. Hurry! Hurry!
Let's go.

39:22.486 --> 39:24.112
(GROWLING)

39:24.321 --> 39:26.198
(HALEY SCREAMING)

39:27.908 --> 39:29.951
SAM:
Come on. Come on.

39:30.035 --> 39:34.122
No! Damn. Get behind me.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.811
Hey!

40:16.748 --> 40:19.000
Not bad, huh?

40:23.839 --> 40:26.883
WILKINSON: So the bear came back again
after you yelled at it?

40:27.092 --> 40:28.760
That's when it circled the campsite.

40:28.969 --> 40:32.013
I mean, this grizzly must have weighed
800, 900 pounds.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.182
WILKINSON:
We'll go after it at first light.

40:34.391 --> 40:37.185
So really,
I don't know how to thank you.

40:40.647 --> 40:44.025
-Must you cheapen the moment?
-Yeah.

40:45.152 --> 40:48.405
-You riding with your brother?
-Yeah.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.575
Let's go.

41:03.003 --> 41:05.255
I hope you find your father.

41:08.842 --> 41:10.677
Thanks, Sam.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.106
MAN:
Close her up.

41:27.903 --> 41:30.113
Man, I hate camping.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.073
Me too.

41:32.282 --> 41:34.743
(SIREN WAILING)

41:34.951 --> 41:37.704
Sam, you know we're gonna
find Dad, right?

41:38.246 --> 41:40.332
Yeah, I know.

41:41.458 --> 41:43.710
But in the meantime...

41:45.420 --> 41:47.297
...I'm driving.

42:04.314 --> 42:07.525
