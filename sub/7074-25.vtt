WEBVTT

00:11.212 --> 00:12.181
- Thanks for a great year.
- You got it.

00:12.849 --> 00:13.950
Mr. Winger!

00:14.518 --> 00:16.653
I hope you will be seizing
the day this summer.

00:16.721 --> 00:18.121
Thanks, Professor Whitman.

00:18.189 --> 00:20.491
And I hope you'll be seizing
a more contemporary movie.

00:20.559 --> 00:22.393
Looking good, Leonard.

00:22.461 --> 00:23.661
Stroke or tai chi?

00:23.729 --> 00:24.796
Tai chi.

00:24.863 --> 00:26.164
Keep it up.

00:26.231 --> 00:29.035
And keep up whatever
it is you're doing, Garrett.

00:29.103 --> 00:30.903
It's called "chillaxing."

00:30.971 --> 00:31.972
Duh!

00:32.039 --> 00:33.940
- Hey-hey,
what's up, Jeff? Hi.

00:34.008 --> 00:36.443
Hello, good morning, howdy.

00:36.511 --> 00:38.280
Wait, Jeff.
I'll walk with you.

00:42.418 --> 00:43.651
Uh...

00:43.719 --> 00:46.054
I got class
in, like, five hours, so...

00:46.122 --> 00:47.522
All right, I'll see you, babe.

00:47.590 --> 00:48.590
Sayonara.

00:48.658 --> 00:49.858
I can't believe I made it

00:49.926 --> 00:51.359
Through my first year
of college.

00:51.427 --> 00:52.527
I finally get to click send

00:52.594 --> 00:54.362
On so many
"I told you so" emails.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.630
Yeah, it's pretty great.
Not much could ruin today.

00:56.698 --> 00:57.865
Hi!

00:57.932 --> 00:59.566
Oh, shoot. I forgot
saying that summons him.

00:59.634 --> 01:00.801
Will you two be attending

01:00.868 --> 01:02.802
Tomorrow's, uh,
transfer ceremony to send off

01:02.870 --> 01:05.471
All the students leaving
for so-called real schools?

01:05.540 --> 01:07.275
There's a formal dance
afterward.

01:07.343 --> 01:09.678
How many dances
is this school gonna have?

01:09.745 --> 01:10.979
Five.

01:11.047 --> 01:13.816
If you come to all of them,
you get one of these.

01:13.884 --> 01:15.985
I assumed your whole posse
would be coming to the dance,

01:16.053 --> 01:17.988
Having heard the exciting news
about Britta.

01:19.491 --> 01:21.158
Banana rhino.

01:21.226 --> 01:23.661
Banana Sam Elliott.

01:23.729 --> 01:24.863
Levar banana Burton.

01:26.032 --> 01:27.333
Banana King Tut.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.336
Here, give me that.

01:29.403 --> 01:32.005
It's more like this.

01:34.243 --> 01:35.877
B-banana penis.

01:37.547 --> 01:39.982
Sure, you would've loved it
if he did it.

01:40.050 --> 01:41.184
What?

01:41.251 --> 01:43.119
What's happened
to you and me, Troy?

01:43.187 --> 01:44.420
Remember how hard we laughed

01:44.488 --> 01:46.022
When we first heard
the term "teacher's aids"?

01:46.090 --> 01:47.257
Yeah.

01:47.325 --> 01:49.326
And then we found out
a teacher did have aids.

01:49.394 --> 01:51.528
So what's everybody doing
this summer?

01:51.596 --> 01:53.197
I'm taking the boys on a trip.

01:53.265 --> 01:55.033
Money's tight, so I hope
I can convince them

01:55.100 --> 01:57.836
For one more year that motels
are tiny, little theme parks.

01:57.903 --> 01:59.871
Yeah, I got to find
a new place to live.

01:59.939 --> 02:01.273
My dad wants me
to leave the nest,

02:01.341 --> 02:02.975
So he feels less weird
that his girlfriend is 20.

02:03.042 --> 02:04.810
You could live in a pyramid.

02:04.877 --> 02:06.478
Oh, wait.

02:06.546 --> 02:08.680
Abed, your dorm room's got
a bunk bed, right?

02:08.747 --> 02:10.882
Yep.

02:12.985 --> 02:15.820
Um, everyone has to go
to the transfer dance tomorrow.

02:15.887 --> 02:16.921
I'm going.

02:16.988 --> 02:18.556
My friend Gary's transferring.

02:18.623 --> 02:19.556
Oh, good.

02:19.624 --> 02:20.691
- Finally.
- Thank God.

02:20.758 --> 02:22.059
Hope he transfers to hell.

02:22.126 --> 02:23.193
More importantly,

02:23.261 --> 02:25.997
Our very own Britta Perry,
it turns out,

02:26.064 --> 02:28.766
Has been nominated
for transfer queen.

02:28.834 --> 02:31.203
Oh, that's nice!

02:31.271 --> 02:33.339
What the hell
is a transfer queen?

02:33.406 --> 02:35.007
It's like prom queen.
You wear a sash.

02:35.075 --> 02:36.442
And there's a vote,
and if you win,

02:36.510 --> 02:38.511
They put a crown on your head,
and I am so jealous, Britta,

02:38.579 --> 02:40.113
I want to murder you.
Aren't you excited?

02:40.181 --> 02:41.114
No.

02:41.181 --> 02:42.382
How did I get nominated?

02:42.449 --> 02:43.850
Don't let it upset you, Britta.

02:43.918 --> 02:45.351
It's the last day
of the semester.

02:45.419 --> 02:46.452
Nothing can ruin that.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
Hi!

02:47.588 --> 02:49.689
Amazing.
He's like an evil genie.

02:49.756 --> 02:51.190
Just spreading the news.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.858
Some folks say
"transfer formal"

02:52.926 --> 02:54.526
Isn't really rolling
off the tongue,

02:54.594 --> 02:58.730
So we're just gonna call it
"the tranny dance"!

02:58.798 --> 03:00.465
Much more Greendale.

03:01.001 --> 03:08.538
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:08.541 --> 03:10.809
What kind of community college
has a prom?

03:10.877 --> 03:12.311
Proms weren't even cool
in high school.

03:12.379 --> 03:14.513
It's that kind of crap that made
me drop out in the first place.

03:14.581 --> 03:15.748
You know,
you don't actually have

03:15.815 --> 03:18.484
To lie on a sofa
like it's a Woody Allen movie.

03:18.552 --> 03:20.820
Thank you for telling me that
in the last session, dumbass.

03:20.887 --> 03:22.321
Now, look...

03:22.389 --> 03:24.657
There are bugs
on the windshield of your mind

03:24.725 --> 03:26.558
You may never be able
to squeegee,

03:26.626 --> 03:28.428
Like a certain birthday party

03:28.495 --> 03:30.663
Attended by a rather
enterprising transient

03:30.731 --> 03:32.232
In a dinosaur costume.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.501
But there are other
more recent streaks

03:34.568 --> 03:36.503
That you might yet be able
to wipe clear,

03:36.571 --> 03:38.338
Like your adolescent fear

03:38.406 --> 03:40.507
Of being
a so-called blow-up doll.

03:40.575 --> 03:43.176
I really think this nomination
may actually help that.

03:43.244 --> 03:45.011
So you think
I'd feel better about myself

03:45.079 --> 03:46.846
If I got all sexed up,
went over there,

03:46.914 --> 03:49.617
And really tried to be crowned
queen of the dingbats?

03:49.684 --> 03:51.418
- Precisely.
- Wow.

03:51.486 --> 03:54.021
Guess you really get what
you pay for with free therapy.

03:54.089 --> 03:55.656
Ouch.
That stung a little bit.

03:55.723 --> 03:56.657
Thanks.

03:56.724 --> 03:58.325
- Oh.
- Oh.

03:58.392 --> 04:00.627
I'll save you some time.

04:00.695 --> 04:01.962
He listens to you talk
for a year,

04:02.029 --> 04:03.296
Then recommends a makeover.

04:03.364 --> 04:04.798
Well, don't wear
as much lipstick

04:04.865 --> 04:06.132
As you did on Valentine's day.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.368
Your mouth
looked like a coin purse.

04:08.436 --> 04:10.803
- Senor Chang--

04:10.871 --> 04:13.639
Greendale's foremost,
if only, Spanish teacher.

04:13.707 --> 04:15.174
What can I do for you?

04:15.241 --> 04:17.608
I am actually a student now.

04:17.677 --> 04:19.476
- Oh.
- But I was thinking,

04:19.545 --> 04:22.147
As a teacher and as my friend,

04:22.214 --> 04:25.316
Um, if you could help me...

04:25.384 --> 04:27.285
Cheat my way through school.

04:27.352 --> 04:29.053
I have a counterproposal.

04:29.121 --> 04:30.788
How about...

04:30.856 --> 04:33.658
I point out to you that we've
never actually been friends,

04:33.726 --> 04:36.661
Then laugh at your
very well-deserved misfortune?

04:36.729 --> 04:39.330
Let's just try that a second.

04:43.869 --> 04:45.670
No, Jorge, you killed it.

04:45.738 --> 04:47.505
Are you going to Abed's kegger?

04:47.573 --> 04:49.174
Sweet.

04:49.241 --> 04:51.176
You probably
don't want to talk to me.

04:51.244 --> 04:52.844
Well, it's not junior high.

04:52.912 --> 04:55.514
We're mature adults, Michelle.
We can talk.

04:55.582 --> 04:58.517
I think I handled
our breakup poorly.

04:58.585 --> 04:59.852
Before I respond to that,

04:59.919 --> 05:02.121
I'll have to take
a extra-strength vitamin duh.

05:04.591 --> 05:05.790
Duh.

05:05.858 --> 05:07.625
We started getting serious,
and I got scared,

05:07.693 --> 05:10.294
And it's possible
I made a mistake.

05:10.362 --> 05:13.130
Maybe we can talk
about it sometime.

05:13.198 --> 05:16.166
I miss you.

05:16.234 --> 05:17.967
- Mm-mmm.

05:18.035 --> 05:21.304
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

05:21.371 --> 05:23.406
Cool.

05:23.473 --> 05:25.207

- Thanks.

05:38.054 --> 05:39.087
Funny...

05:39.155 --> 05:41.323
You know,
I-I spend so much time here,

05:41.390 --> 05:43.658
I forget that
we don't live together.

05:45.327 --> 05:46.661
Then I think...

05:46.728 --> 05:48.696
"what if we lived together?"

05:48.763 --> 05:51.332
Here, I'm gonna check
on the other keg.

05:51.399 --> 05:53.200
Hey, Troy, you ever seen
one of these?

05:53.268 --> 05:54.368
It's called a beer bong.

05:54.435 --> 05:56.336
You're not supposed
to inhale, though.

05:56.404 --> 05:57.771
I almost died outside.

05:57.838 --> 05:59.439
Why does abed hate me?

05:59.506 --> 06:00.940
What, are you kidding?
Look at him.

06:01.008 --> 06:02.141
He probably hates America.

06:02.209 --> 06:03.543
Hey, babe, babe.

06:03.610 --> 06:04.610
Guess what.

06:04.678 --> 06:06.112
Your boyfriend
just got offered a spot

06:06.180 --> 06:07.614
On the number-one
community-college

06:07.682 --> 06:09.049
Hacky sack team in the nation.

06:09.117 --> 06:10.818
- Oh, my God! Sweetie!
- Oh, my God.

06:10.885 --> 06:12.086
I'm assuming that's huge.

06:12.154 --> 06:13.388
Of course it's huge.
Are you kidding me?

06:13.455 --> 06:15.457
I mean, you know, I'm not
into the fame and stuff,

06:15.524 --> 06:17.592
But I could be the next
Yngwe Mackadangdang junior.

06:17.660 --> 06:19.161
I know.

06:19.229 --> 06:20.630
There's just one thing,
mountain flower,

06:20.697 --> 06:22.798
And that's that the, uh...

06:22.866 --> 06:24.667
The school's in Delaware.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.470
Thank you.

06:27.538 --> 06:28.804
You know...

06:28.872 --> 06:30.305
If you don't go
to this dance tomorrow,

06:30.373 --> 06:32.041
We are not gonna
see each other for months.

06:32.109 --> 06:34.843
It's not a Jane Austen novel.
We have cell phones.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.113
What? Aah! Oh.
Oh, jeez, sorry.

06:38.181 --> 06:39.214
What are you doing?

06:39.282 --> 06:41.450
Well, you had hair
I was gonna move.

06:41.518 --> 06:43.319
- You were gonna move my hair?
- I don't know.

06:43.386 --> 06:44.654
Have you ever thought
of yourself

06:44.721 --> 06:45.955
As a guarded person, Britta?

06:46.023 --> 06:46.956
Am I?

06:47.024 --> 06:49.492
Watch.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.161
See?
It's alarming, right?

06:51.229 --> 06:52.729
Right?

06:53.732 --> 06:55.266
Oh...

06:55.333 --> 06:57.635
Professor Slater, hi.
What are you doing here?

06:57.703 --> 07:00.505
Oh, you know, end of the year,
randomly wandering.

07:00.573 --> 07:01.773
Hi, Jeff.

07:01.841 --> 07:03.142
Are you two...?

07:03.210 --> 07:04.310
No.

07:04.377 --> 07:05.444
The two of you aren't...?

07:05.512 --> 07:06.679
No.

07:06.746 --> 07:08.213
- No, just friends.
- Same here.

07:08.281 --> 07:09.815
Good...For you.

07:09.882 --> 07:12.117
Will I see you
at the dance, Britta?

07:12.185 --> 07:13.619
Kind of obligated,

07:13.686 --> 07:15.554
Seeing as I'm nominated
for queen,

07:15.621 --> 07:16.788
So...
Oh.

07:16.856 --> 07:18.656
I thought you were
all into female empowerment.

07:18.724 --> 07:20.791
What's more empowering
than a woman in a crown?

07:22.961 --> 07:25.229
Just did my first keg stand!

07:25.297 --> 07:26.364
Ha ha!

07:26.432 --> 07:28.632
Can't feel my legs.

07:28.700 --> 07:29.700
Mm!

07:33.006 --> 07:37.408
♪ dancing in your underwear,
taking air conditioner repair ♪

07:38.476 --> 07:40.577
♪ so you can get a job ♪

07:40.644 --> 07:45.014

07:47.352 --> 07:48.685
Whoo! Ha ha!

07:48.753 --> 07:52.389
Our original school song by
the venerable Pierce Hawthorne.

07:52.457 --> 07:54.024
He made that up.
Hmm?

07:54.092 --> 07:57.194
Everyone remember to vote
before the coronation.

07:57.262 --> 07:59.697
The nominees are identified
with sashes

07:59.765 --> 08:01.865
That say "tranny queen."

08:01.933 --> 08:04.368
By the way,
we do offer summer classes,

08:04.436 --> 08:07.071
Which are a great way to, um...

08:07.138 --> 08:09.039
Um, broaden your mind.
Have fun.

08:10.575 --> 08:11.642
Hi.
You're here for me.

08:11.709 --> 08:13.010
Guys! Guys...

08:13.078 --> 08:15.879
Vaughn got recruited
to a college in Delaware.

08:15.947 --> 08:17.448
I'm gonna go with him
for the summer.

08:17.516 --> 08:19.850
- Finally, a classic
last-day-of-school plot Twist.

08:19.918 --> 08:22.720

08:37.471 --> 08:40.171
I'm transferring with Vaughn.

08:40.239 --> 08:41.905
What?
When did you decide that?

08:41.974 --> 08:44.909
I spent three months
researching backpacks

08:44.977 --> 08:48.078
Before I chose the one
that I use now.

08:48.146 --> 08:51.315
I don't want to be
that person anymore.

08:51.383 --> 08:53.384

08:53.451 --> 08:56.020
Well, for your
and Vaughn's sake,

08:56.087 --> 08:57.688
I hope it works out.

08:57.756 --> 08:59.857

of the rest of the group,

08:59.925 --> 09:01.692

09:01.760 --> 09:04.730

Whoa!

nobody's taken this cookie.

09:12.105 --> 09:13.772

09:13.840 --> 09:16.241

to be a Professor,

09:16.309 --> 09:18.877

09:18.945 --> 09:20.211

09:20.279 --> 09:21.946

09:22.014 --> 09:24.382
Oh, if it was in Spanish,
you wouldn't know, would you?

09:24.449 --> 09:25.549
Ah, bup, bup, bup.

09:25.617 --> 09:27.885
Hit a Professor,
you'll get expelled.

09:27.952 --> 09:31.054
I will find a loophole.

09:31.122 --> 09:32.389

09:32.457 --> 09:34.257

Oh, okay.
Okay, okay.

18:05.340 --> 18:06.474
No, no, no,
you know what, Duncan?

18:06.541 --> 18:07.475
- What?
- That's enough.

18:07.542 --> 18:08.475
- Why?
- You have a problem.

18:08.543 --> 18:09.710
- Oh, I have a problem?
- Yes.

18:09.778 --> 18:12.146
Who is it here
who has a dalmatian fetish?

18:12.213 --> 18:13.380
- Oh, OK--okay.

18:13.448 --> 18:15.549
Well, that is
a oversimplification,

18:15.617 --> 18:16.917
And you are suspended.

18:16.985 --> 18:18.451
Oh, come on.

18:18.519 --> 18:19.886
Oh, not a teacher anymore.

18:19.953 --> 18:21.387
What's this?

18:21.455 --> 18:22.755
A roll of quarters.
Why?

18:22.823 --> 18:24.056
Funny question.
Oh, man!

18:24.124 --> 18:25.558
- Friends, help me, friends!
- Help me!

18:25.626 --> 18:27.427
He's on me!
He's on me!

18:27.495 --> 18:29.562
I'll do it.
I'll move in with you.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.231
Fantastic, buddy!

18:31.298 --> 18:32.565
Why don't you come over
on Saturday?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.134
My tailor will fit you
for a uniform.

18:36.970 --> 18:39.772
Guys, let's break it up.
Come on, let's not fight.

18:39.840 --> 18:40.973
Let's not fight.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.709
No, no!

19:03.932 --> 19:05.099
I thought you left.

19:05.167 --> 19:07.702
I couldn't go.

19:07.769 --> 19:08.736
What happened?

19:08.804 --> 19:10.371
I guess
as we were driving away,

19:10.439 --> 19:12.874
I finally started living
in the moment,

19:12.941 --> 19:15.709
And I realized that,
in the moment,

19:15.777 --> 19:17.178
Greendale is where I belong.

19:18.747 --> 19:20.315
What are you doing out here?

19:20.383 --> 19:22.217
Oh, you know...

19:22.285 --> 19:24.153
Britta and Slater told me
they loved me.

19:24.220 --> 19:26.054
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:26.122 --> 19:28.057
- What did you do?
- I ran away.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.059
I don't know.
It's hard.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.894
Slater makes me feel like I do

19:31.962 --> 19:34.064
When I write
my new year's resolutions.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.300
She makes me feel like the guy
I want to be.

19:36.368 --> 19:38.402
And Britta makes me feel
like the guy I am

19:38.470 --> 19:40.238
Three weeks after new year's,

19:40.305 --> 19:41.739
When I'm back to hitting
my snooze button

19:41.807 --> 19:43.341
And screening
my mom's phone calls--

19:43.408 --> 19:44.875
Back to who I really am.

19:44.943 --> 19:46.577
So...

19:46.645 --> 19:48.746
Do you try to evolve...

19:48.814 --> 19:51.749
Or do you try to know
what you are?

19:51.817 --> 19:53.084
I don't know.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.919
I wish I could live two lives.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.688
One of me would go with Vaughn,
and one of me could stay here.

19:57.756 --> 19:59.090
Yeah, one of me could be
back with Slater,

19:59.157 --> 20:00.591
And the other could try it
with Britta.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.092
And then we could
all get together

20:02.160 --> 20:03.526
For some weird foursome.

20:04.962 --> 20:07.763
Um, I guess I got to...

20:07.831 --> 20:08.898
Got to deal with it.

20:08.965 --> 20:10.266
Good luck.

20:10.333 --> 20:13.101
Um...

20:13.169 --> 20:14.369
I'm glad you're staying.

"video yearbook"?

What a year.

Only two pregnancy scares.

I give this year a "d"

I can't believe
I spent ten bucks on this.

I don't know
