00:00.055 --> 00:01.888
<i>Previously on Criminal Minds...</i>

00:01.895 --> 00:03.570
Elle, two weeks of pure heaven.

00:03.575 --> 00:05.605
Do not call me for anything.
Have a great time.

00:05.615 --> 00:06.656
You all deserve a break.

00:06.665 --> 00:09.308
- Welcome to paradise.
- Your resort is beautiful.

00:09.325 --> 00:12.056
A man said there had been a murder
in room 19.

00:12.065 --> 00:14.712
- Get down !
- Who are you ?!

00:14.715 --> 00:17.158
- Where is the victim's head ?
- I'm here on vacation.

00:17.164 --> 00:18.910
- Someone sent you a head ?
- From Jamaica.

00:18.918 --> 00:20.561
Morgan and Elle are
in Jamaica right now.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.909
Agent Greenaway wasn't even here
when this man was killed.

00:22.917 --> 00:25.093
- How did he know where we were ?
- A man came to the door

00:25.106 --> 00:26.903
with something he said
you would need right away.

00:26.936 --> 00:28.010
He came to the door ?

00:28.027 --> 00:29.510
I was playing a game yesterday.

00:29.527 --> 00:31.903
The hacker could have gotten
into my computer first.

00:31.917 --> 00:34.482
I have far less protection
on my own laptop.

00:34.495 --> 00:36.870
- How could you be that stupid ?
- I found him.

00:36.897 --> 00:38.710
You what ?
I know who he is, the hacker.

00:38.725 --> 00:41.083
<i>- His name's Geist.
- Now you're on a quest.</i>

00:41.098 --> 00:44.092
<i>A young girl's life depends on
the successful completion of it.</i>

00:46.768 --> 00:49.400
<i>The one rule is,
only the members of your team</i>

00:49.408 --> 00:51.240
<i>may participate in the quest.</i>

00:51.976 --> 00:54.561
He's given us all the clues
needed to complete this quest,

00:54.565 --> 00:56.391
including this book code.

00:56.496 --> 00:59.122
Each one of these sets of numbers
represents a particular word.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.382
Yeah but from what book ?

01:00.395 --> 01:02.510
JJ, get some reporters here
as soon as possible.

01:02.526 --> 01:04.483
Didn't he say that we had to keep
this under the team ?

01:04.486 --> 01:06.212
<i>- We're looking for this man...
- No.</i>

01:06.218 --> 01:09.471
<i>No, I specifically said
no outsiders.</i>

01:09.908 --> 01:10.973
- I'm awake.
- Anderson,

01:10.986 --> 01:12.263
- take Greenaway home.
- Yes, sir.

01:12.275 --> 01:13.351
Get some sleep.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.682
<i>I told you,
there was one rule.</i>

01:15.695 --> 01:17.540
<i>One rule !</i>

01:21.106 --> 01:24.782
<i>The defects and faults of the mind
are like wounds in the body.</i>

01:25.156 --> 01:28.572
<i>After all imaginable care
has been taken to heal them up,</i>

01:28.758 --> 01:31.792
<i>still there will be a scar
left behind.</i>

01:32.377 --> 01:35.111
French writer
Francois la Rochefoucauld.

01:41.366 --> 01:43.670
Sir, I thought you'd want to know.
We identified

01:43.686 --> 01:46.271
the girl in the video...
Rebecca Bryant.

01:46.377 --> 01:48.131

02:07.007 --> 02:09.411
Reid, how many books do you think
are published in a year ?

02:09.425 --> 02:11.523
In the whole world ?
Thousands.

02:12.476 --> 02:14.552
Great, and all
we gotta do is find one.

02:16.046 --> 02:18.462
You know, I can see this unsub
gettin'our phone numbers

02:18.478 --> 02:20.763
and addresses from the bureau
personnel files, but come on, man,

02:21.385 --> 02:23.701
it really says in there
that Gideon digs Nellie Fox ?

02:23.817 --> 02:25.773
Or that JJ collects butterflies ?

02:26.275 --> 02:27.802
I didn't even know
these things about us.

02:27.876 --> 02:30.551
"Ever would it be night,
but always clear day

02:30.565 --> 02:31.913
to any man's sight."

02:32.596 --> 02:34.990
Reid, not again with the poem
from the music box, please.

02:35.007 --> 02:36.762
There's something
familiar about it.

02:37.028 --> 02:39.001
I think I've heard it
somewhere before.

02:39.016 --> 02:41.390
- Thought you had a photographic memory.
- Eidetic memory,

02:41.408 --> 02:43.063
and that's primarily related
to things I read.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.161
Like I said, this is something
I think I've heard.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.171
- Which leaves us...
- Nowhere, that's where it leaves is.

02:47.186 --> 02:48.503
Not necessarily.

02:48.927 --> 02:51.213
How would we proceed
if we didn't have all these clues ?

02:51.977 --> 02:53.561
What's the first thing
we'd look at ?

02:53.567 --> 02:54.561
Victimology.

02:54.585 --> 02:56.680
Why this particular victim
in this particular place

02:56.686 --> 02:59.042
- at this particular time ?
- We have a victim, don't we ?

02:59.316 --> 03:00.603
Rebecca Bryant.

03:01.297 --> 03:03.392
Missin'out of South Boston,
Virginia.

03:03.477 --> 03:05.920
You can get there in a few hours
if you hurry. Take JJ.

03:05.925 --> 03:07.890
Find out everything there is
to know about this girl.

03:07.918 --> 03:08.713
You go it.

03:08.795 --> 03:11.042
Been lettin'him lead us around
like he's somethin'more than he is.

03:11.048 --> 03:12.592
He's just
another unsub.

03:12.615 --> 03:14.361
Let's start puttin'together a profile.

03:14.375 --> 03:16.310
- What you want me to do ?
- Just keep workin'on this.

03:16.328 --> 03:18.271
If anybody can
put it together, you can.

03:40.775 --> 03:42.141
Please help me.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.063
Anderson ?

03:49.666 --> 03:50.892
Where's agent Greenaway ?

03:51.105 --> 03:52.992
- Sir ?
- I told you to take her home.

03:53.008 --> 03:54.540
I  dropped her off
half an hour ago.

03:54.558 --> 03:56.151
Take her home does not mean

03:56.495 --> 03:58.303
drop her off.
We're dealing with an unsub

03:58.316 --> 04:00.951
who has all of our personal information,
including our home addresses.

04:00.968 --> 04:02.051
Get back
over there now.

04:02.068 --> 04:03.423
- But...
- Now !

04:12.477 --> 04:13.553
Agent Greenaway ?

04:14.348 --> 04:15.931
- Yes ?
- Case file, please.

04:17.886 --> 04:19.072
How did I get here ?

04:19.075 --> 04:21.151
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Without a case file,

04:21.557 --> 04:22.903
you'll have to get off.

04:22.916 --> 04:24.213
The rules are very...

04:24.235 --> 04:25.072
Clear !

04:29.596 --> 04:30.471
She's back.

04:30.486 --> 04:32.071
Okay.
Get a large bore going.

04:32.126 --> 04:33.061
I'm on it.

04:33.348 --> 04:35.521
If we don't get this pressure up,
we're gonna lose her again...

04:35.746 --> 04:36.682
permanently.

"Possible Book Titles"

05:19.997 --> 05:22.800
Thousands of books
published every year.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.352
This is impossible.

05:30.786 --> 05:32.280
Year... every year.

05:37.787 --> 05:38.902
1963.

05:45.406 --> 05:46.530
- Agent Hotchner ?
- Yes ?

05:46.566 --> 05:48.063
The delivery guy's
on the way up.

05:48.078 --> 05:49.452
The one from the press conference ?

05:50.398 --> 05:51.210
Thank you.

05:55.047 --> 05:57.621
The book has to be the right volume
and the right publication date,

05:57.638 --> 05:59.002
or the code won't work, right ?

05:59.206 --> 05:59.702
Okay.

05:59.717 --> 06:01.553
When you talk about Nellie Fox,
it's in regards

06:01.568 --> 06:03.362
to the 1959 White Sox.

06:03.376 --> 06:06.182
That's the year that's important
to you, but for some reason,

06:06.517 --> 06:08.323
this is a 1963 card.

06:08.395 --> 06:10.172
Well, maybe
he couldn't find a'59.

06:10.237 --> 06:13.033
You think a pale clouded yellow
butterfly was easy to find, or a...

06:13.078 --> 06:15.833
or a music box that specifically
plays the trout quintet ?

06:16.415 --> 06:18.590
So a book published in 1963.

06:18.886 --> 06:19.873
It has to be.

06:20.998 --> 06:21.520
Maybe.

06:21.578 --> 06:24.433
The guy who delivered the puzzle
to my house just turned himself in.

06:31.818 --> 06:34.003
You delivered a package
to my house yesterday.

06:35.066 --> 06:37.490
-  Do I need a lawyer here ?
- Late in the day to my wife.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.270
I guess I could check my logs.

06:40.288 --> 06:42.123
You  know exactly
which delivery we mean.

06:43.976 --> 06:44.742
Look,

06:44.995 --> 06:47.260
this guy comes up to me
on the street with the package.

06:47.386 --> 06:49.040
He says it only
needs to go a few miles,

06:49.478 --> 06:51.171
and that a girl's life
depended on it.

06:51.186 --> 06:52.752
And you didn't find that
suspicious ?

06:52.857 --> 06:54.722
He said a girl's life
depended on it, man.

06:54.738 --> 06:56.810
I wasn't gonna take no chances
with somethin'like that.

06:56.826 --> 06:58.791
I see, so you're
a humanitarian here then.

06:59.608 --> 07:01.471
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

07:11.936 --> 07:12.813
How much ?

07:15.045 --> 07:15.701
Thousand...

07:16.466 --> 07:17.300
cash.

07:17.915 --> 07:18.940
Seriously,

07:19.108 --> 07:20.311
do I need a lawyer ?

07:21.412 --> 07:23.539
This guy is infuriatingly good.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.863
He routed his IP through
major corporations,

07:25.886 --> 07:27.223
crisscrossed it through countries,

07:27.247 --> 07:28.630
I thought you tracked the hacker.

07:28.637 --> 07:30.693
No I only found
what he wanted me to find :

07:30.706 --> 07:32.692
appartment where
Giles was dead.

07:32.706 --> 07:34.570
Reid a hacker capable of getting
into my systems

07:34.585 --> 07:36.643
is going to have amazingly
sophisticated equipment.

07:36.658 --> 07:38.110
Did giles's apartment have that ?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.872
- He didn't have a couch.
- Exactly.

07:39.887 --> 07:42.583
Giles was a smokescreen
I should have seen through.

07:42.737 --> 07:45.883
But now I have
this glorious program I wrote,

07:45.906 --> 07:48.290
tracking the hacker
through his other identity...

07:51.105 --> 07:52.472
Sir Kneighf.

07:53.196 --> 07:56.321
"K-n-e-l-g-h-f."

07:57.195 --> 07:58.553
That's an odd spelling.

08:00.515 --> 08:01.783
Do you need something ?

08:03.257 --> 08:04.952
Yeah, is there a database

08:04.966 --> 08:07.211
which lists all the books
published in a given year ?

08:07.306 --> 08:08.552
Individual publishers have lists,

08:08.576 --> 08:09.950
I don't think there's anything like
a master one,

08:09.967 --> 08:12.233
plus it would depend upon the year,
because the further back you go,

08:12.248 --> 08:14.312
the less likely there'll
be any database at all.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.603
1963.

08:15.636 --> 08:18.083
Yeah, ok, that would be an example
of extremely less likely.

08:19.628 --> 08:22.653
Could you do me a favor ? Type
something into a search engine for me ?

08:22.747 --> 08:24.823
"Never would it be night,

08:24.877 --> 08:27.771
but always clear day
to any man's sight."

08:29.758 --> 08:31.371
That's from a poem,
"The parliament of

08:31.388 --> 08:33.510
"fowls !" Yeah, yeah !
Chaucer, my...

08:34.784 --> 08:36.212
my mom use to read me that.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.712
It's widely considered
as the first Valentine's poem.

08:40.496 --> 08:42.972
Your mom read you
Valentine's poems ?

08:42.985 --> 08:44.362
Hello, therapy.

08:44.538 --> 08:45.943
Chaucer.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.430
Chaucer,
"parliament of fowls."

08:49.578 --> 08:52.053
Fowls, "parliament of fowls,"
Chaucer.

08:52.288 --> 08:55.220
It has to be at least
283 pages long,

08:55.238 --> 08:56.572
but the poem has to be longer.

08:56.588 --> 08:59.341
Something published in 1963.

08:59.928 --> 09:02.332
A butterfly indigenous
to Great Britain. Why ?

09:02.656 --> 09:04.002
Something born,

09:04.016 --> 09:05.523
Something from Great Britain.

09:07.066 --> 09:08.113
Medieval.

09:08.268 --> 09:09.833
Medieval. Chaucer.

09:09.896 --> 09:11.463
Chaucer was middle english.

09:11.887 --> 09:14.283
Middle english spelling
of the word "fowls..."

09:14.328 --> 09:15.653
"FOWLES"

09:17.298 --> 09:19.760
there was a contemporary
british author... Fowles.

09:19.857 --> 09:22.253
John Fowles. Will you type it
into a search engine ?

09:24.166 --> 09:26.762
He wrote the Magus,
he wrote the French Lieutenant's Woman.

09:26.805 --> 09:29.123
Anything in 1963
published in Great Britain ?

09:29.126 --> 09:30.142
The Collector.

09:31.198 --> 09:33.952
Collector... baseball cards,
skeleton keys, music boxes.

09:33.966 --> 09:35.831
These are things
that are collected.

09:39.308 --> 09:40.172
Reid.

09:42.755 --> 09:44.093
What'd he look like ?

09:44.438 --> 09:46.091
I don't really know.

09:46.156 --> 09:48.550
He had a big coat on
and a hat pulled down over his face.

09:48.565 --> 09:50.240
So you can't describe
him at all then ?

09:50.697 --> 09:52.630
Well, the part of his face
that I could see

09:52.648 --> 09:53.980
was all messed up.

09:54.007 --> 09:55.901
- It was messed up ?
- Yeah...

09:55.908 --> 09:58.233
scarred,
all burned up.

09:59.568 --> 10:01.040
Burn scars.

10:01.055 --> 10:03.773
- Could explain the trouble moving.
- We know what the book is.

10:03.926 --> 10:05.923
The collector by John Fowles.

10:05.927 --> 10:06.890
You sure ?

10:06.915 --> 10:09.181
Not absolutely. Not until we see
if the code works, but

10:09.197 --> 10:11.933
I have four separate libraries
searching for the 1963 edition

10:11.955 --> 10:14.130
- published in Great Britain.
- Well done, Reid.

10:14.148 --> 10:15.072
Agent Gideon,

10:15.086 --> 10:17.953
there's a call for you on line 2,
says it's extremely urgent.

10:18.387 --> 10:20.571
- Is there a name ?
- Sort of. He calls himself

10:20.576 --> 10:21.952
the Fisher King.

10:28.966 --> 10:30.702
This could be the unsub, guys.

10:30.808 --> 10:31.450
Why ?

10:31.465 --> 10:33.981
In mythology, the Fisher King
is the grail king.

10:34.255 --> 10:35.353
"Sir Kneighf,"

10:35.365 --> 10:37.401
it's an anagram...
for "Fisher King."

10:40.998 --> 10:43.833
Fisher King's at the end
of all grail quests.

10:46.616 --> 10:48.130
Line 2 trapped
and traced.

10:52.705 --> 10:54.092
<i>- Gideon.
- What I had to do</i>

10:54.108 --> 10:55.591
<i>was not my fault.</i>

10:55.825 --> 10:56.701
Excuse me ?

10:56.716 --> 10:59.251
<i>It was distasteful and barbaric.</i>

11:01.175 --> 11:01.991
Who is this ?

11:02.005 --> 11:03.893
<i>No one else had to be hurt.</i>

11:04.287 --> 11:06.012
Call yourself "the Fisher King"?

11:06.277 --> 11:07.543
<i>I told you</i>

11:07.837 --> 11:10.492
there were rules.

11:10.647 --> 11:12.843
I'm actually more interested
in exactly

11:12.858 --> 11:14.682
how you got all those burns.

11:17.005 --> 11:17.922
Remember  this

11:17.935 --> 11:20.522
<i>next time you decide
to step outside my instructions.</i>

11:20.525 --> 11:23.161
Agent Greenaway did not
have to die like that.

11:48.726 --> 11:50.002
Daddy ?

11:52.827 --> 11:54.773
Notify the O.R.
She's bleeding out.

11:54.787 --> 11:57.041
They're gonna need 4 units of "O"
on the rapid infuser.

11:57.058 --> 11:59.631
- Yes, doctor.
- Fight with me here. Fight.

12:00.926 --> 12:01.662
FBI,

12:01.667 --> 12:03.951
- one of my agents was just brought in.
- Agent Hotchner, I am sorry.

12:03.966 --> 12:05.631
Anderson, where is she ?
I got there just

12:05.647 --> 12:07.240
- as the ambulance was leaving.
- Where is she, Anderson ?

12:07.256 --> 12:09.660
- They just took her up to surgery.
- Then she's alive.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.941
- What do we know ?
- The local P. D. Said

12:11.957 --> 12:14.211
someone forced her back door and
surprised her in the living room.

12:14.226 --> 12:16.020
They were probably laying
in wait for her.

12:16.055 --> 12:17.262
After she was...

12:18.898 --> 12:21.870
it appears she dialed 911 herself
before she passed out.

12:22.078 --> 12:23.450
Why weren't we notified ?

12:23.468 --> 12:25.330
The offender apparently
took her ID. And gun.

12:25.335 --> 12:27.110
The uniform I talked to didn't even
know she was in the bureau

12:27.128 --> 12:28.860
- until I arrived on scene.
- Get back over there.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.031
This is a federal crime scene.
Nobody touches anything.

12:31.046 --> 12:32.442
We process it.
Go.

12:32.457 --> 12:33.501
Yes, sir.

12:38.036 --> 12:39.482
Mrs. Valez,
are you there ?

12:39.485 --> 12:41.140
<i>Yes, Dr. Reid, I am.</i>

12:41.285 --> 12:43.750
<i>I have a first edition
of the collector,</i>

12:43.837 --> 12:45.320
published in Great Britain

12:45.336 --> 12:47.070
in 1963.

12:48.076 --> 12:48.912
Wonderful.

12:49.447 --> 12:50.193
Mrs. Valez,

12:50.205 --> 12:52.651
I'm gonna read you
a set of 3 numbers.

12:52.846 --> 12:54.682
The first is gonna be
a page number,

12:54.817 --> 12:57.391
the second, a line number
on that page,

12:57.416 --> 12:59.611
and the third,
a word number in that line.

12:59.625 --> 13:00.762
Do you understand me ?

13:00.866 --> 13:02.093
<i>Yes,  I understand.</i>

13:02.475 --> 13:04.930
All right, the first
is page 222.

13:05.258 --> 13:06.933
<i>Page 222. got it.</i>

13:06.948 --> 13:08.860
Line 23.

13:10.168 --> 13:11.722
<i>Line 23. got it.</i>

13:11.757 --> 13:14.201
What is the 16th word
on that line, Ms. Valez ?

13:14.508 --> 13:15.272
<i>"The."</i>

13:16.726 --> 13:17.952
"The"?
Great.

13:19.595 --> 13:21.342
Page 91,

13:21.476 --> 13:22.632
line 11,

13:22.925 --> 13:24.410
word 13.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.730
<i>"Path."
Does that make sense ?</i>

13:26.827 --> 13:28.650
"The path." Yeah, that absolutely
makes sense.

13:29.365 --> 13:31.460
All right,
please go to page 31...

13:34.188 --> 13:35.782
Trap and trace
got nothin'.

13:37.218 --> 13:39.302
Unsub used
a disposable cell.

13:40.496 --> 13:42.093
We got our best CSU team.

13:42.126 --> 13:43.892
If he left anything,
a print,

13:43.918 --> 13:45.493
a hair, sweat, anything...

13:45.508 --> 13:46.601
they'll find it.

13:48.027 --> 13:49.453
I sent her home,
jason.

13:49.615 --> 13:50.622
This wasn't you.

13:50.636 --> 13:52.400
I should have been
clearer with Anderson.

13:53.326 --> 13:54.610
Try Morgan and JJ again.

13:54.635 --> 13:56.441
I tried'em 3 times.
They're out of cell range.

13:56.457 --> 13:58.990
Try'em again. I don't want'em
to hear about this on the news.

14:03.015 --> 14:04.832
She was 16
when she was abducted.

14:04.847 --> 14:06.192
She's 18 now.

14:06.207 --> 14:07.701
Her birthday was in august.

14:07.706 --> 14:08.980
Help me !

14:11.958 --> 14:13.840
Two years
in that little cell.

14:14.406 --> 14:16.300
All right, let's go over this
one more time.

14:16.317 --> 14:18.393
She took off for school,
but never got there, correct ?

14:18.416 --> 14:19.383
Correct.

14:19.495 --> 14:21.152
None of the neighbors
saw her that morning ?

14:21.188 --> 14:23.741
It doesn't even appear
that they canvassed at all.

14:23.758 --> 14:25.970
Ok, JJ, I need you to see
if the originating detective

14:25.988 --> 14:28.191
can meet us at the house'cause
there's just something really funky

14:28.208 --> 14:29.902
about this whole
investigation.

14:30.186 --> 14:31.962
Well, I will as soon
as we re-enter the world

14:31.977 --> 14:33.601
of cell phone service.

14:38.365 --> 14:40.711
"The path to the end
began at his start."

14:41.107 --> 14:43.661
"To find her first calm
her long broken heart."

14:43.915 --> 14:45.393
"She sits in a window"

14:45.407 --> 14:46.953
"with secrets from her knight."

14:47.037 --> 14:49.843
Is it adventure that keeps
him out of her sight ?"

14:50.358 --> 14:51.233
Another puzzle ?

14:51.727 --> 14:54.503
It's a riddle.
"Began at his start."

14:55.945 --> 14:57.691
"The youngest
holds the key."

14:57.697 --> 14:58.992
"Sits in a window."

14:59.007 --> 15:01.301
"Secrets, adventure."

15:07.427 --> 15:08.762
"Secrets from her knight"?

15:09.977 --> 15:11.201
"Sits in the window."

15:11.218 --> 15:12.903
<i>She calls them
your adventures.</i>

15:15.698 --> 15:17.803
"Ever would it be night,
but always clear day."

15:17.806 --> 15:19.643
That'd be...
that'd be bright light.

15:19.646 --> 15:22.401
<i>Someone delivered this
to the desk last night for you.</i>

15:24.597 --> 15:26.250
It's never night in Las Vegas.

15:26.265 --> 15:27.153
Excuse me ?

15:29.466 --> 15:31.061
I need to be connected
to the field office

15:31.076 --> 15:33.091
closest to Las Vegas,
Nevada, immediately.

15:34.635 --> 15:36.201
Hi. This is Dr. Spencer Reid

15:36.218 --> 15:38.592
with the behavioral analysis unit
at Quantico.

15:38.777 --> 15:40.970
Look, I need my mother picked up
and brought to Virginia

15:40.977 --> 15:42.991
in protective custody
as soon as possible.

15:44.207 --> 15:46.933
We're searching for an unsub
who shot one of our agents today,

15:46.946 --> 15:50.043
and I think he might know my mother,
and I believe she may be in danger.

15:51.408 --> 15:52.351
Yes.

15:53.307 --> 15:55.622
She's at the Bennington Sanitarium

15:55.808 --> 15:57.081
in Las Vegas.

15:57.655 --> 15:59.033
Her name's Diana Reid.

15:59.337 --> 16:01.263
She's a patient there.

16:04.867 --> 16:05.771
Diana ?

16:06.176 --> 16:07.602
There's someone here to see you.

16:16.806 --> 16:17.642
Yes, sir.

16:18.357 --> 16:20.473
If there's anything we can do.

16:20.956 --> 16:21.831
Yes, sir.

16:22.657 --> 16:23.503
We will.

16:25.796 --> 16:26.671
What's up ?

16:28.755 --> 16:29.963
That was Hotch.

16:30.016 --> 16:31.631
Don't tell me. Reid
already figured it out,

16:31.648 --> 16:33.350
and we drove all the way out
here for nothing, right ?

16:33.355 --> 16:35.173
- Derek.
- What ?

16:36.935 --> 16:37.690
What ?

16:38.788 --> 16:40.352
The... the unsub...

16:42.428 --> 16:44.683
Elle was shot in her apartment
this morning.

16:50.066 --> 16:50.953
What ?

16:58.945 --> 17:00.711
- What are you doing ?
- I'm goin'back.

17:00.727 --> 17:02.292
No, no, no.
Hotch said not to.

17:02.307 --> 17:05.260
- I don't give a damn what Hotch said.
- But, Derek, he's right.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.790
There's  nothing we can do
at the hospital, okay ?

17:07.806 --> 17:10.521
But maybe we can find
the unsub through... through her,

17:10.528 --> 17:13.073
through the victim's profile,
through Rebecca.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.501
How bad ?

17:17.435 --> 17:18.761
She's in surgery.

17:18.846 --> 17:19.883
That's all they know.

17:32.238 --> 17:35.191
<i>Dad, it was hard
growing up without you.</i>

17:35.356 --> 17:36.351
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

17:36.465 --> 17:38.852
<i>No, it wasn't your fault.</i>

17:42.828 --> 17:44.873
<i>I just missed you so much.</i>

17:45.475 --> 17:46.980
<i>I'm always with you.</i>

17:47.356 --> 17:49.562
<i>- What's gonna happen to me ?
- Happen ?</i>

17:50.656 --> 17:52.491
<i>That's up to you, baby.</i>

17:53.778 --> 17:55.280
<i>That's up to you.</i>

17:57.185 --> 17:58.300
Any word ?

17:58.588 --> 17:59.532
No.

18:00.018 --> 18:03.112
I called JJ. I told her that
we'd call them if anything changed.

18:06.317 --> 18:07.363
What's all that ?

18:07.435 --> 18:09.660
That unsub's
extremely organized.

18:09.775 --> 18:12.481
Sounded truly shocked that
we didn't follow the rules.

18:12.927 --> 18:15.601
Honestly believed we would
simply listen to his directions.

18:15.687 --> 18:18.473
He's delusional.
He... thinks he's a mythological king

18:18.536 --> 18:20.590
But delusion and this level
of organization

18:20.605 --> 18:22.473
are almost
mutually exclusive.

18:22.545 --> 18:25.282
You don't meticulously plan contacts
in the real world

18:25.295 --> 18:28.020
if you're suffering psychotic breaks
from reality.

18:29.477 --> 18:30.633
How is she ?

18:30.898 --> 18:31.981
No word yet.

18:32.256 --> 18:33.602
Is the scene processed ?

18:33.615 --> 18:35.811
They're finished. We still have it
locked up tight, though.

18:35.825 --> 18:38.360
- You find anything ?
- CSU found a partial print.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.450
The shooter wrote a message
on the wall in blood,

18:40.467 --> 18:42.752
and in one of the smudges,
they found a whirl pattern.

18:42.985 --> 18:45.031
They made a lift. They aren't sure
whether it's enough to get a hit,

18:45.048 --> 18:47.083
but they are
processing it now.

18:53.248 --> 18:54.302
Rules.

19:00.366 --> 19:01.542
She's ok...

19:02.476 --> 19:03.490
your mom.

19:04.968 --> 19:06.242
Agents picked her up.

19:06.578 --> 19:07.870
She's flying here
right now.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.300
I forgot she used to always
read me this poem.

19:13.496 --> 19:14.582
It's funny, huh ?

19:14.636 --> 19:15.410
Funny ?

19:15.427 --> 19:17.790
Should have realized sooner than that.
Nobody knows things like the fact

19:17.808 --> 19:19.953
that JJ collects butterflies
except for me.

19:20.396 --> 19:22.453
People tell me their secrets
all the time.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.410
Think it's'cause they know I don't have
anyone to betray them to...

19:26.348 --> 19:28.150
except... my mother.
I....

19:29.645 --> 19:31.290
I tell her pretty much everything.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.991
I don't think anyone would mind.

19:33.035 --> 19:35.192
Do you know that
I write her a letter every day ?

19:35.625 --> 19:38.510
- That's nice.
- It depends on why I write her.

19:40.008 --> 19:40.863
What do you mean ?

19:40.938 --> 19:42.542
I write her letters so

19:42.665 --> 19:44.993
I won't feel so guilty
about not visiting her.

19:51.008 --> 19:53.902
Did you know that schizophrenia
is genetically passed ?

20:02.245 --> 20:04.281
All of her things
are still right here.

20:04.306 --> 20:05.642
We kept it all.

20:06.436 --> 20:08.881
Everything that was in her room,
in case she ever...

20:11.886 --> 20:13.502
You said there's a videotape ?

20:13.515 --> 20:14.592
Yes, ma'am.

20:14.606 --> 20:17.220
The man who abducted
your daughter sent it to us.

20:19.225 --> 20:20.743
You're sure it's Rebecca ?

20:21.287 --> 20:22.552
Yes, ma'am,
we're sure.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.853
Ma'am I don't mean to impose but

20:24.868 --> 20:26.781
we've had ourselves
a really long drive.

20:27.028 --> 20:28.860
- You got any coffee ?
- Excuse me ?

20:28.947 --> 20:30.401
I'll come with you,
ma'am.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.353
Oh, certainly. Sure.

20:37.457 --> 20:38.512
Detective...

20:41.497 --> 20:43.470
I've seen kids missing
for a decade,

20:44.138 --> 20:47.110
and their rooms look exactly the way
they did the day that they left.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.930
Parents don't just pack up
their kid's stuff and put'em in boxes

20:49.937 --> 20:51.030
in the garage.

20:51.265 --> 20:52.993
Parents don't give up,
ever.

20:54.267 --> 20:55.753
What the hell
is goin'on here ?

20:55.765 --> 20:58.143
This wasn't exactly
a cut and dried missing.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.970
This Rebecca is no angel.

21:00.116 --> 21:02.451
She was in trouble,
a lot of it all the time.

21:02.656 --> 21:04.562
- What kind of trouble ?
- Name it.

21:04.576 --> 21:06.523
Dope, vandalism, theft,

21:06.645 --> 21:07.531
truancy.

21:07.915 --> 21:10.190
Nobody even blinked when
she didn't show up for school that day.

21:10.205 --> 21:12.983
She was a part-time
attendee at best.

21:12.987 --> 21:14.490
None of that was in the report.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.112
And why would it be ?

21:16.177 --> 21:18.140
Because it's relevant, detective.

21:18.505 --> 21:21.453
Look, uniforms filed
the initial report.

21:21.838 --> 21:23.563
Missing persons never
did a supplemental

21:23.576 --> 21:26.270
because the girl had run away
5 or 6 times before.

21:26.288 --> 21:27.861
She didn't run away
this time, did she ?

21:27.875 --> 21:29.291
Yeah, apparently not.

21:29.468 --> 21:31.722
Nobody even bothered
to look for this girl

21:31.737 --> 21:33.763
- for two years ?
- No.

21:34.526 --> 21:35.943
Why ?
Why was she actin'out ?

21:36.185 --> 21:38.271
Was there a problem at home ?
Was there abuse ?

21:38.625 --> 21:39.731
Abuse ?

21:40.605 --> 21:42.392
From the moment we brought her
into the house,

21:42.408 --> 21:44.262
we treated Rebecca
like an angel.

21:44.278 --> 21:46.630
You just said "brought her
into the house."

21:46.647 --> 21:47.893
When she was 5 years old,

21:47.905 --> 21:50.162
we took Rebecca in
as a foster child.

21:50.896 --> 21:53.110
And after a couple of years,
we adopted her.

21:53.547 --> 21:55.220
Where are her birth parents ?

21:55.236 --> 21:57.302
Something happened
to the whole family.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.211
Did she ever talk about it ?

21:59.335 --> 22:01.223
I don't even think
she remembered it.

22:01.378 --> 22:02.861
She was just a little girl.

22:02.876 --> 22:05.451
So her name
hasn't always been Bryant.

22:05.597 --> 22:06.460
No.

22:06.786 --> 22:07.972
It was...

22:09.027 --> 22:11.492
Garner.
Rebecca Garner.

22:14.235 --> 22:15.161
Please.

22:15.448 --> 22:17.010
I brought you dinner.

22:18.306 --> 22:19.551
It's chicken.

22:19.646 --> 22:20.551
I'm sick.

22:20.988 --> 22:22.262
I need a doctor.

22:22.526 --> 22:24.483
- you like chicken.
- No,

22:25.036 --> 22:25.590
no.

22:26.315 --> 22:28.641
- Just take the chains off me.
- No,

22:28.677 --> 22:30.303
- you'll try to escape.
- Please, no.

22:30.318 --> 22:32.042
I won't.
I promise.

22:32.386 --> 22:34.910
I'll be back for your tray
in half an hour.

22:36.315 --> 22:39.110
Why don't you just kill me,
you son of a bitch ?!

22:42.095 --> 22:43.871
Because I love you too much,
Rebecca.

23:00.885 --> 23:02.800
<i>- Garcia.
- Hey, it's Morgan.</i>

23:02.885 --> 23:03.851
Derek, what do you need ?

23:03.867 --> 23:06.002
Garcia, I need information
on an adoption.

23:06.017 --> 23:08.313
- Name ?
- Adopted name is Rebecca Bryant,

23:08.327 --> 23:09.792
birth name is Garner.

23:09.965 --> 23:11.952
<i>- Where ?
- Somewhere around South Boston,</i>

23:11.975 --> 23:13.900
Virginia,
13 years ago.

23:14.117 --> 23:15.001
Nothing.

23:15.468 --> 23:16.330
Nothing ?

23:16.506 --> 23:18.713
I'll try just the name
with a wider search.

23:19.757 --> 23:21.403
Ok, there's a Rebecca Garner

23:21.407 --> 23:24.570
who was adopted by
a Mr. And Mrs. Joseph Bryant

23:24.625 --> 23:27.013
on december 4, 1993,

23:27.026 --> 23:28.351
in Clark County, Nevada.

23:28.368 --> 23:29.792
Wait. Nevada ?

23:29.817 --> 23:31.573
That's what it says.
The rest is sealed.

23:31.586 --> 23:32.992
<i>Garcia, unseal it.
I need to know</i>

23:32.997 --> 23:35.473
what happened to that girl's family
to cause her to need adopting.

23:35.485 --> 23:36.951
Okay, I'll work on it.

23:40.216 --> 23:41.130
Coffee ?

23:42.276 --> 23:43.251
No.

23:46.228 --> 23:48.510
We don't have enough
for a profile yet,

23:48.868 --> 23:50.590
- not a good one.
- No.

23:52.087 --> 23:54.662
- Some generalities.
- Not enough to catch him.

23:56.798 --> 23:59.103
Press conference was
the thing to do, right ?

24:00.425 --> 24:01.300
Sorry ?

24:03.385 --> 24:05.390
Brought the unsub out into the open,
he made a mistake,

24:05.406 --> 24:07.173
left a partial print.

24:07.608 --> 24:09.060
We wouldn't have had that.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.703
- No.
- It was really the only way to go.

24:14.277 --> 24:16.560
I did the right thing.
I did my job.

24:17.907 --> 24:19.650
Elle will
understand that.

24:24.587 --> 24:26.360
She'll understand.

24:32.585 --> 24:34.052
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

24:34.327 --> 24:35.971
<i>What if I don't come out of it ?</i>

24:37.356 --> 24:39.003
<i>What if I don't wake up ?</i>

24:39.777 --> 24:42.123
<i>You keep talkin'like you don't have
any choice, peanut.</i>

24:42.548 --> 24:44.272
<i>You can choose to fight,</i>

24:44.325 --> 24:46.043
<i>to beat the odds.</i>

24:46.697 --> 24:48.040
<i>It's up to you.</i>

24:51.225 --> 24:53.141
<i>What if I want
to stay with you ?</i>

24:55.996 --> 24:57.902
<i>Well, that's a choice, too.</i>

25:05.505 --> 25:07.322
That's why you're
so skinny, you know ?

25:08.295 --> 25:09.423
Too much coffee.

25:10.556 --> 25:12.082
Thanks a lot, guys.
I've got her.

25:16.707 --> 25:18.981
You know I'm terrified of flying.

25:19.038 --> 25:20.410
I know, mom.
I'm sorry.

25:20.438 --> 25:22.942
Well, then why did you have
those fascists arrest me ?

25:23.197 --> 25:26.000
Mom, they're not fascists,
and you were not arrested.

25:26.708 --> 25:28.070
I'm trying to protect you.

25:28.095 --> 25:29.863
By forcing me to do the one thing

25:29.878 --> 25:32.311
that frightens me more
than anything else ?

25:33.816 --> 25:34.881
I need to show
you something.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.101
Follow me.

25:49.185 --> 25:50.480
<i>Yeah, talk to me.</i>

25:50.505 --> 25:52.020
Not only did I find
your records,

25:52.038 --> 25:54.373
I found some newspaper
articles about your girl.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.330
- Newspaper articles ?
- Yeah. Apparently

25:56.346 --> 25:59.590
most of Rebecca Garner's family
died in a house fire in 1992.

25:59.607 --> 26:02.403
Faulty electrical wiring
in their tract house.

26:02.645 --> 26:04.773
So when she was 4.

26:04.785 --> 26:06.013
<i>Yeah, mrs. Garner,</i>

26:06.028 --> 26:08.163
The both Garner boys,
one of the Garner girls.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.532
Rebecca was found in the backyard
crying, but unharmed.

26:10.617 --> 26:11.962
<i>How'd she get there ?</i>

26:12.008 --> 26:15.083
Her father probably. He was
a teacher at a Vegas public school,

26:15.096 --> 26:16.562
<i>and he tried to save
the rest of the family,</i>

26:16.577 --> 26:19.522
<i>but he suffered massive burns
to his entire body and nearly died.</i>

26:19.535 --> 26:23.443
Spent years in a burn ICU,
and it was during that time

26:23.868 --> 26:25.890
that he gave up his parental rights
to Rebecca,

26:25.915 --> 26:28.983
so that she could be put up for adoption
because there was no other family.

26:29.027 --> 26:32.130
Could explain her acting out. You watch
your whole family die in front of you ?

26:32.147 --> 26:33.940
<i>The father was awarded a huge</i>

26:33.956 --> 26:36.251
settlement from the contractors
who built the development.

26:36.265 --> 26:38.132
They were using
faulty materials.

26:38.466 --> 26:39.583
Good work, garcia.

26:39.608 --> 26:41.761
<i>Print that up for me, all right ?
We'll be back pretty soon.</i>

26:43.406 --> 26:44.701
What ?
Somethin'else ?

26:44.868 --> 26:45.632
No.

26:45.957 --> 26:47.411
It just says here that

26:47.438 --> 26:49.291
after the father left
the medical hospital,

26:49.315 --> 26:51.513
he spent a few years
at a Vegas sanitarium.

26:51.525 --> 26:52.501
Bennington.

26:52.548 --> 26:53.801
<i>That mean somethin'to you ?</i>

26:53.807 --> 26:55.030
Yeah. That's where...

26:56.566 --> 26:57.451
Garcia ?

26:57.536 --> 26:58.661
I gotta go.

27:00.497 --> 27:01.882
Could that be...?

27:11.985 --> 27:13.620
Oh, my God.

27:17.565 --> 27:18.891
This is where you work ?

27:19.285 --> 27:20.620
This is where we meet.

27:21.415 --> 27:24.282
My desk, you can see it, it's right out
there in the bullpen area.

27:25.865 --> 27:27.500
The table's round.

27:27.886 --> 27:28.640
Yeah.

27:29.007 --> 27:30.692
Just like I wrote
you in my letters.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.672
Yes, just like you wrote
in your letters.

27:35.818 --> 27:38.203
Dr. Jessen gave me
the book you brought.

27:38.656 --> 27:40.022
Marjorie Kemp.

27:41.495 --> 27:42.802
She's your favorite.

27:43.977 --> 27:46.372
That particular book
is one of her minor works.

27:48.678 --> 27:50.533
Mom, no !
Don't... don't.

27:50.618 --> 27:52.473
You can't grab stuff
off the board.

27:52.486 --> 27:54.171
This key is evidence.

27:56.495 --> 27:58.331
Mom, the unsub that
we're looking for...

27:58.926 --> 28:00.032
the... the bad guy

28:00.185 --> 28:02.641
knows things about
my colleagues'personal lives,

28:02.658 --> 28:03.501
things that...

28:04.146 --> 28:05.702
only you would know.
Do you

28:06.416 --> 28:07.870
write about them
in you journals ?

28:07.907 --> 28:10.573
My journals are none
of the government's business !

28:10.588 --> 28:12.330
- I'm not the government, mom.
- Well, this...

28:12.687 --> 28:14.801
certainly looks like
a government office.

28:15.557 --> 28:18.023
Mother, do you write
about my colleagues'personal lives ?

28:18.048 --> 28:20.302
Why did you bring me here,
Spencer ?

28:24.025 --> 28:26.433
I need to ask you some things
about a man I think you might know.

28:26.448 --> 28:27.690
A bad man.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.861
He's killed some people,
and he's holding a girl hostage.

28:29.877 --> 28:31.802
You think I know
someone like that ?

28:33.788 --> 28:36.273
Will you just watch the tape
and see if he sounds familiar ?

28:49.566 --> 28:51.913
<i>I had to make sure
I had your complete attention.</i>

28:53.198 --> 28:54.332
<i>I assure you,</i>

28:54.496 --> 28:57.251
<i>you will all understand in the end
why it must be this way.</i>

28:57.777 --> 28:59.593
<i>You might even thank me.</i>

29:02.265 --> 29:03.541
You do know him ?

29:03.866 --> 29:05.413
I'm sure it's...

29:06.037 --> 29:07.853
Randall Garner.

29:07.875 --> 29:10.390
Randall Garner ?
He was with me at the hospital.

29:10.468 --> 29:13.752
He's a very emotionally
disturbed man.

29:14.306 --> 29:16.902
Reid, I got to the end
of the IP string.

29:17.036 --> 29:18.860
Sir kneighf,
the fisher king,

29:19.245 --> 29:21.152
his name is Randall Garner.

29:21.695 --> 29:23.983
He's Rebecca Bryant's
biological father.

29:33.047 --> 29:35.201
Reid and Garcia think
they've ID'd the unsub.

29:35.476 --> 29:36.061
How ?

29:36.077 --> 29:37.790
I don't know, but they want
to know how to proceed.

29:37.806 --> 29:40.362
Well, one of us should be there.
You go.

29:40.378 --> 29:42.233
I want to be here when she comes
out of surgery.

29:42.236 --> 29:44.463
- Call me immediately.
- Immediately.

29:46.037 --> 29:47.633
- Hotch ?
- Yeah ?

29:47.646 --> 29:50.061
The only way for the organization level
to be so high

29:50.078 --> 29:51.941
is the unsub believes
it's all real.

29:51.955 --> 29:54.691
He believes he's the keeper
of the grail, needs us to find it.

29:56.166 --> 29:58.602
We have to make him understand
it isn't real.

29:59.446 --> 30:00.391
Right

30:04.295 --> 30:06.151
I can't believe
she's real.

30:06.686 --> 30:09.351
- What do you mean ?
- Whenever he talked about Rebecca,

30:09.376 --> 30:12.103
he never said
she was his daughter.

30:12.205 --> 30:14.692
He said all his children
died in the fire.

30:14.907 --> 30:16.880
He spoke of a Rebecca,

30:17.377 --> 30:19.202
more in the abstract.

30:19.988 --> 30:22.612
I really thought
she was a metaphor,

30:22.617 --> 30:24.762
not an actual human being.

30:25.516 --> 30:26.643
An ideal.

30:26.817 --> 30:27.793
A grail.

30:28.287 --> 30:30.003
He thinks he's
the fisher king.

30:30.318 --> 30:32.403
- Who does ?
- Randall Garner, our unsub.

30:32.417 --> 30:33.640
He believes

30:33.677 --> 30:35.952
you're all modern-day knights

30:35.965 --> 30:37.402
of the round table.

30:38.515 --> 30:41.373
Derek Morgan,
this is my mother, Diana Reid.

30:41.927 --> 30:42.792
It's your mother ?

30:44.017 --> 30:45.900
Ma'am, it's a... it's a pleasure
to meet you.

30:46.306 --> 30:48.403
So where are we on finding
this son of a bitch ?

30:48.655 --> 30:51.260
I rechecked all the clues. There's
nothing that points to an address.

30:51.276 --> 30:53.143
The adoption records
for Rebecca

30:53.155 --> 30:55.860
listed an address of the fire,
so I made a call to Nevada,

30:55.877 --> 30:57.751
and it's vacant.
No one ever rebuilt.

30:57.767 --> 30:59.700
Nevada ? So we don't even know
what state he's in ?

30:59.707 --> 31:01.951
I'll search the tax records,
see if he owns any property.

31:02.055 --> 31:04.561
- Excuse me.
- Mom, do you know we're...

31:04.576 --> 31:07.292
just before the agents
got me from the hospital,

31:07.308 --> 31:09.883
a man delivered
this to me.

31:09.996 --> 31:12.851
It's a photo of a house
with an address on the back.

31:13.646 --> 31:14.942
Shiloh, Virginia ?

31:15.005 --> 31:16.643
That's only 10 miles from here.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.032
That's it, guys.
It's open.

31:47.657 --> 31:48.443
Hotch ?

31:52.376 --> 31:53.680
Guys, listen up.

31:53.976 --> 31:56.921
He wants us to know we're in the
right place, so keep your eyes open.

31:59.696 --> 32:00.902
Let's go.

32:19.678 --> 32:21.403
It's Morgan.
We're clear.

32:34.238 --> 32:35.982
There's someone
upstairs.

32:40.745 --> 32:42.210
- Where ?
- I saw a shadow.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.283
Randall Garner ?

32:44.855 --> 32:45.852
FBI !

32:49.416 --> 32:50.402
Garner ?!

32:51.497 --> 32:52.881
Come out, Garner !

33:04.206 --> 33:05.143
He's in there.

33:05.158 --> 33:07.082
- All right, cover me. I'm gonna go in.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:07.106 --> 33:08.551
What ?
What ?

33:08.626 --> 33:11.120
Mr. Garner ?
My name's spencer Reid.

33:11.295 --> 33:13.491
You were in the hospital
with my mother. I think...

33:13.876 --> 33:15.990
I think she might have
confused you.

33:16.147 --> 33:18.603
All we want to do
is help Rebecca.

33:18.608 --> 33:21.760
That's exactly what you want, right ?
That's why you sent us the puzzles ?

33:22.115 --> 33:24.491
That's why you said you hoped
you'd be seeing us soon ?

33:24.545 --> 33:26.183
Ask the question.

33:26.367 --> 33:28.812
There is no magical question,
Mr. Garner.

33:29.417 --> 33:31.333
He believes if I ask him
the right question,

33:31.337 --> 33:33.400
it'll heal all of his wounds.

33:33.408 --> 33:35.102
Do you know the question ?

33:35.518 --> 33:36.781
I know what he wants.

33:37.736 --> 33:40.191
- I'm gonna move to where he can see me.
- Reid ! Reid, no !

33:40.217 --> 33:41.333
- Reid !
- Fall back.

33:41.488 --> 33:43.440
Reid !
Reid, no !

33:44.917 --> 33:47.161
Wait a minute.
Reid !

33:47.297 --> 33:48.760
Stay calm, Mr. Garner.

33:48.788 --> 33:51.202
Ask the question,
sir Percival.

33:51.308 --> 33:53.290
I told you,
I'm not Percival.

33:53.587 --> 33:56.561
My name is Dr. Spencer Reid
from the FBI.

33:57.006 --> 33:58.992
You were in the hospital
with my mother, Diana ?

33:59.007 --> 34:01.033
If you want the grail,
you must ask the question !

34:01.036 --> 34:02.222
She's not a grail !

34:02.857 --> 34:04.311
She's your daughter.
Her name's Rebecca.

34:04.317 --> 34:07.033
My daughters died in a fire
and my son

34:07.375 --> 34:09.250
- and my wife.
- Rebecca lived.

34:09.266 --> 34:12.163
No. Your mother, she explained
it all to me.

34:12.175 --> 34:14.581
My mother's a paranoid schizophrenic
who'd forget to eat

34:14.597 --> 34:16.553
if she wasn't properly medicated
and supervised.

34:16.558 --> 34:18.893
She made me realize
none of it was real.

34:18.908 --> 34:20.260
I didn't lose Rebecca.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.481
She never existed
in the first place.

34:22.665 --> 34:24.703
She does exist,
mr. Garner,

34:25.875 --> 34:27.393
and we're here
to help her.

34:36.447 --> 34:37.741
Hotch, Morgan ?

34:38.496 --> 34:39.600
I think maybe

34:40.436 --> 34:42.713
it'd be better if you guys
waited downstairs.

34:42.717 --> 34:43.781
What ?

34:43.987 --> 34:47.043
Mr. Garner and I are just gonna
talk alone up here.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.451
Go ahead and talk, Reid,
but we're not goin'anywhere.

34:49.938 --> 34:51.612
Ask the question.
I'll be healed,

34:51.946 --> 34:53.420
and you may take the grail.

34:53.896 --> 34:55.543
Just ask the question,
sir knight.

34:57.467 --> 34:58.363
I can't.

34:58.378 --> 34:59.513
Heal me !

35:01.867 --> 35:04.290
Mr. Garner,
a fisher king wound

35:04.586 --> 35:07.142
cannot be healed
by somebody else.

35:08.057 --> 35:09.761
It's not a wound
to the body.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.191
It's a wound
to the memory.

35:12.128 --> 35:13.701
Wound to the mind.
It's...

35:14.385 --> 35:17.633
it's a wound that...
only you can find,

35:18.026 --> 35:20.122
and a wound that
only you can heal.

35:20.427 --> 35:22.151
Just ask the question.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.423
There's only one question
that matters,

35:26.435 --> 35:27.692
Mr. Garner.

35:28.385 --> 35:30.563
There's only one
really important question.

35:32.356 --> 35:34.312
Can you forgive yourself ?

35:36.127 --> 35:37.531
I couldn't get to them.

35:38.596 --> 35:40.341
If you tell me where she is,

35:40.508 --> 35:42.260
you can save Rebecca now.

35:44.757 --> 35:46.143
Tell me where Rebecca is.

35:46.156 --> 35:47.532
You already know.

35:47.545 --> 35:49.321
I sent your mother the map.

35:51.158 --> 35:52.193
What map ?

35:52.505 --> 35:53.942
Can I forgive myself ?

35:56.317 --> 35:57.750
No, I can't.

35:58.988 --> 36:00.112
Run !

36:05.837 --> 36:07.633
Don't move Reid, don't move !

36:08.615 --> 36:10.911
Get him out, let's go !
Let's go !

36:12.395 --> 36:13.382
Let's go !

36:14.278 --> 36:16.193
- What the hell was that ?
- He had a bomb.

36:16.196 --> 36:17.782
You didn't think we needed
to know that ?

36:17.787 --> 36:19.673
- I told you to go downstairs.
- Well, you didn't say bomb.

36:19.685 --> 36:21.582
- You left that part out.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

36:21.586 --> 36:23.750
Stop ? The house is on fire, Reid.
Let's go !

36:23.757 --> 36:25.051
Just let me think,
let me think !

36:25.068 --> 36:27.513
He's the fisher king, this is
his castle, Rebecca's got to be here.

36:27.527 --> 36:29.403
Reid, there may not be time
for a search. Let's go.

36:29.416 --> 36:30.852
Location's on the map
that he gave to my mom.

36:30.865 --> 36:33.272
Reid, all she told us about
was that photo. Let's go !

36:36.486 --> 36:38.263
Down...
she's in the basement downstairs !

36:38.328 --> 36:39.730
How do you
know that ?!

36:40.046 --> 36:41.840
I'm in here !

36:42.216 --> 36:44.112
Is the house on fire ?

36:44.146 --> 36:45.471
She's in here !

36:47.137 --> 36:48.650
I'm chained !

36:48.845 --> 36:50.901
Get me out of here !
I'm chained.

36:50.995 --> 36:53.163
- Here I've got the bed.
- Hurry !

36:53.296 --> 36:54.693
He called me sir Percival.

36:54.748 --> 36:56.273
- Hurry !
- Reid, hurry.

36:56.286 --> 36:58.100
The key. The key.
The youngest one holds the key.

36:58.118 --> 36:59.560
Tell me you got the key.

36:59.566 --> 37:01.403
Come on man !
Let's go !

37:02.355 --> 37:04.550
Let's go !
We got no time ! Go !

37:07.267 --> 37:08.352
You got her ?

37:08.807 --> 37:09.622
Come on.
Let's go.

37:16.956 --> 37:20.002
<i>"It has been said
that time heals all wounds.</i>

37:20.248 --> 37:21.750
<i>I do not agree.</i>

37:21.956 --> 37:23.421
<i>The wounds remain.</i>

37:23.455 --> 37:26.473
<i>In time, the mind,
protecting its sanity,</i>

37:26.475 --> 37:29.682
<i>covers them with scar tissue,
and the pain lessens,</i>

37:30.046 --> 37:31.452
<i>but it is never gone."</i>

37:31.768 --> 37:33.002
Rose Kennedy.

37:34.658 --> 37:36.723
<i>Dad, there's something...</i>

37:37.546 --> 37:40.521
<i>- it's okay.
- No, I want to say it.</i>

37:41.287 --> 37:42.450
<i>That day...</i>

37:43.516 --> 37:45.111
<i>I was just mad that day.</i>

37:45.178 --> 37:47.211
<i>I wanted you to teach me
to ride my bike.</i>

37:47.227 --> 37:49.202
<i>I knew that you
had to work.</i>

37:49.867 --> 37:52.032
<i>I was just being
selfish and</i>

37:52.428 --> 37:53.660
<i>childish.</i>

37:53.675 --> 37:55.890
<i>Baby, you were 8.</i>

37:57.077 --> 37:59.233
<i>I said,
"I hate you, daddy."</i>

37:59.987 --> 38:02.701
<i>Those are the last words
that I ever said to you.</i>

38:02.957 --> 38:04.231
<i>It's okay, baby.</i>

38:04.315 --> 38:06.901
<i>I've thought so many times
that I wish...</i>

38:07.767 --> 38:10.412
<i>I wish that I had said...</i>

38:11.577 --> 38:13.063
<i>I love you, Daddy.</i>

38:13.667 --> 38:15.450
<i>I love you, too,
peanut,</i>

38:16.198 --> 38:17.520
<i>very much.</i>

38:23.938 --> 38:25.380
<i>I can't stay with you.</i>

38:27.297 --> 38:28.540
<i>That's all right.</i>

38:29.387 --> 38:31.001
<i>Will I ever see you again ?</i>

38:31.278 --> 38:32.911
<i>I'll be here when it's time.</i>

38:36.987 --> 38:38.090
<i>I love you.</i>

38:50.468 --> 38:51.631
There you are.

38:52.658 --> 38:54.733
Sleep.
You're gonna be fine.

39:15.576 --> 39:17.262
Elle's out of surgery.

39:17.406 --> 39:18.452
She's gonna be okay.

39:18.727 --> 39:19.623
Good.

39:20.438 --> 39:22.372
- Is Gideon still at the hospital ?
- Yeah.

39:22.478 --> 39:23.613
How's Rebecca ?

39:23.627 --> 39:25.772
She's in the hospital,
but she should be all right.

39:25.805 --> 39:27.353
Physically, maybe.

39:29.616 --> 39:30.841
Thank you, everyone.

39:32.035 --> 39:33.090
All of you.

39:34.655 --> 39:37.603
Well, we could have only gone
so far without Mrs. Reid.

39:52.927 --> 39:54.252
Mom, we found her.

39:55.088 --> 39:56.321
Rebecca's safe.

39:56.825 --> 39:58.291
You helped us save her life.

40:07.396 --> 40:09.710
- Is it time for lunch yet ?
- What ?

40:10.295 --> 40:13.112
I'm lecturing everyone
in Tristan and Iseult.

40:13.125 --> 40:16.002
They're all gathering
in my room after lunch.

40:18.046 --> 40:19.581
Can I attend the lecture, too ?

40:19.595 --> 40:21.470
Have you read
any of the material ?

40:21.648 --> 40:23.781
I've had them read to me.

40:24.445 --> 40:26.221
Wonderful.

40:26.978 --> 40:28.783
That's the best way,
isn't it ?

40:29.017 --> 40:29.873
Yes, ma'am.

40:30.527 --> 40:31.373
By far.
