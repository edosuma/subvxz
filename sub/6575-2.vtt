19:58.419 --> 20:02.082
Since you four are determined
to stay together and fight the good fight...

20:02.957 --> 20:05.755
...you'll do it on League terms.

20:05.927 --> 20:09.260
Red Tornado volunteered to live here
and be your supervisor.

20:09.430 --> 20:11.159
Black Canary's in charge of training.

20:11.933 --> 20:13.958
I will deploy you on missions.

20:14.369 --> 20:17.805
- Real missions?
- Yes, but covert.

20:17.972 --> 20:20.099
The League will still handle
the obvious stuff.

20:20.274 --> 20:22.834
There's a reason
we have these targets on our chests.

20:23.011 --> 20:25.844
But Cadmus proves
the bad guys are getting smarter.

20:26.014 --> 20:28.380
Batman needs a team
that can operate on the sly.

20:28.549 --> 20:33.043
- The five of you will be that team.
- Cool. Wait. Five?

20:35.323 --> 20:39.020
This is the Martian Manhunter's niece,
Miss Martian.

20:39.193 --> 20:40.217
Hi.

20:40.795 --> 20:43.161
Liking this gig more every minute.

20:43.331 --> 20:45.925
Welcome aboard. I'm Kid Flash.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.830
That's Robin. Aqualad.
It's cool if you forget their names.

20:49.003 --> 20:50.994
I'm honored to be included.

20:55.910 --> 20:58.970
Hey, Superboy. Come meet Miss M.

21:03.151 --> 21:04.880
I like your T-shirt.

21:10.625 --> 21:13.093
Today is the day.

21:15.596 --> 21:18.156
GUARDIAN:
Cadmus changes today.

21:18.599 --> 21:21.591
With Desmond out of the picture,
the Board's placed me in charge.

21:21.769 --> 21:23.737
Dr. Spence,
you're Acting Chief Scientist.

21:23.905 --> 21:25.873
No more G-Gnomes
suppressing our wills.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.871
No more secret breeding projects.

21:28.042 --> 21:31.409
This is a kinder, gentler Cadmus.

21:31.813 --> 21:36.341
<i>DUBBILEX: Then I will, of course,
help in any way I can, brother.</i>

21:37.251 --> 21:41.415
<i>Can the Light afford to leave Guardian
in charge without the G-Gnomes?</i>

21:41.589 --> 21:44.524
<i>We have subtler means of control.</i>

21:44.692 --> 21:47.855
<i>What concerns me is the children.</i>

21:48.062 --> 21:52.431
<i>We now know the League is willing to
employ young heroes to do their dirty work.</i>

21:52.600 --> 21:53.624
<i>That's a dark twist.</i>

21:53.801 --> 21:57.862
<i>Yes, but one that can be played
to our advantage.</i>

21:58.039 --> 22:02.499
<i>Even the temporary loss of the Weapon
may prove useful.</i>

22:02.677 --> 22:07.046
<i>Eventually, everyone sees the Light.</i>

22:36.711 --> 22:38.702
