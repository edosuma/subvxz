Greetings, Cunningham.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.300
I bring you greetings
from the Cosmic Congress,

02:51.438 --> 02:53.532
The Stellar Confederation
and Mindy.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.540
Is that a heavenly body?
Oh, she must have something,

02:55.676 --> 02:57.075
because I'd be willing to walk
ten miles in the snow

02:57.210 --> 02:59.076
to stand in her garbage.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.840
Yeah, well.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.110
It's, uh, really good
to see you again.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.309
Good to see you, too, Earthling.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.419
- Yeah.
- Slip me two.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.612
- Oh, yeah.
- Na no, na no. (squeals)

03:11.658 --> 03:12.784
So what brings you
back to Earth?

03:12.926 --> 03:14.291
Oh, I don't have
to come back to Earth.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.328
I live on Earth
in the year 1979.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.454
- You live in the future?
- Oh, yes.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.090
Yeah, well, hey, tell me,
what's it like in 1979?

03:21.234 --> 03:23.225
Well, number one,
the air is thicker.

03:23.370 --> 03:27.238
The birds wake up in the morning
and go... (coughs)

03:27.374 --> 03:30.207
What am I going to be in 1979?

03:30.343 --> 03:31.708
Well, Mr. President...

03:33.914 --> 03:35.575
Hey, just kidding,
let's get real about this.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.616
Oh.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.947
Well, uh, then who is president?

03:40.087 --> 03:43.489
Well, do you like peanuts?

03:43.623 --> 03:45.057
I can take them or leave them.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.183
Then you'll like Jimmy.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.835
- Do you remember Nixon?
- Oh, yeah, whatever...

03:55.969 --> 03:58.734
Don't ask.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.637
Well, what brings you
back here, anyway?

04:01.775 --> 04:04.142
Well, I've been having trouble
adjusting to life on Earth.

04:04.277 --> 04:05.972
I was talking to myself
the other day,

04:06.113 --> 04:07.672
so I said to myself,
myself said "Huh?"

04:07.814 --> 04:09.612
I want to go back to Earth time

04:09.750 --> 04:11.878
when life was simpler,
when things were...

04:12.018 --> 04:13.144
BOTH:
Humdrum.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.152
Wow, fantastic,
it's a Gestalt happening.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.619
Be here now. Let's join up.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.918
So, I want to go
back to the '50s,

04:19.059 --> 04:21.653
where life was slower,
so I can learn faster.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.194
Yeah, well that's probably
a pretty good idea,

04:23.330 --> 04:25.560
but I got to tell you, I'm not
as humdrum as I used to be.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.100
I'm the science editor
on the school paper now.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.135
I got my own,
my own new set of wheels.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.738
Spent the whole summer
at a dude ranch.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.068
I mean, I am very, very...

04:34.207 --> 04:36.369
humdrum.
What do you need to know?

04:36.510 --> 04:38.774
I'd like to know about...
relationships.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.846
(chuckles)
Boy-girl?

04:40.981 --> 04:42.380
No, I'd like to work
that one out myself.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.041
Well, it is kind of fun.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.676
But I can tell you
about friends...

04:46.820 --> 04:48.618
and family.

04:48.755 --> 04:49.813
We've got a great relationship.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.287
Oh, tell me about that.

04:51.424 --> 04:54.223
I once had a wonderful
relationship with R-14.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.056
- She died?
- No, I dropped her.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.857
She was a test tube.
Not a very pretty sight,

04:57.998 --> 05:00.296
-kind of... (blows raspberry)
- Oh.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.798
Well, I can tell you what I know
about relationships.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.096
You don't have to tell me.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.533
You just have to think it,
and I'll pick it up.

05:04.671 --> 05:07.299
Watch. (squealing)

05:07.440 --> 05:10.171
<i>RICHIE: Well, for a real friend,
you'd do just about anything.</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:11.903
Telling me who I can have
for friends?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.706
- That's supposed
to be shaping me? -Rich...

05:13.847 --> 05:15.315
The next thing
you're going to do,

05:15.448 --> 05:17.507
you're going to tell me I can't
talk to my friend Fonzie here?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.176
Or my sister, Joanie,

05:19.319 --> 05:20.809
-because she's not an Iota?
- Cunningham...

05:20.954 --> 05:23.150
And maybe I don't want
to be number one.

05:24.457 --> 05:25.583
Maybe not at those prices.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.090
Cunningham, do you know
what you're doing?

05:27.227 --> 05:28.319
Yes, sir.

05:28.461 --> 05:31.294
I'm dumping you, sir.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.263
I am Richie Cunningham,

05:34.401 --> 05:38.269
and these are my friends.

05:41.608 --> 05:44.475
So you can just put that
in your Phi Kappa and...

05:44.611 --> 05:46.272
Nu on it!

05:48.148 --> 05:51.550
They all said
you were so tough.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.483
You are the last
of the ducktails

05:53.620 --> 05:55.019
and leather jackets.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.146
Oh, yeah?
What about me, Kirk?

06:04.231 --> 06:06.165
You might even run me
out of town, Kirk.

06:06.299 --> 06:09.394
But there'll be another one
to take my place. (snaps)

06:15.842 --> 06:17.833
And another one. (snaps)

06:22.916 --> 06:24.816
You won't be able
to get rid of us.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.010
They'll come
from all walks of life.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.144
Store owners! (snaps)

06:33.526 --> 06:35.494
Children! (snaps)

06:35.629 --> 06:37.620
Teenagers!

06:38.632 --> 06:41.533
Housewives! (snaps)

06:45.939 --> 06:47.737
They'll be everywhere, Kirk.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.774
Merchants, and townspeople.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.344
(Snaps twice)

06:53.246 --> 06:55.681
Till at last there'll be
a sea of leather jackets.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.715
And they'll put
an end to tyranny

06:57.851 --> 07:00.252
and injustice
throughout the world.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.684
(snaps)

07:02.689 --> 07:04.555
(squealing)

07:04.691 --> 07:07.183
Well, that's very interesting
and very humdrum,

07:07.327 --> 07:08.260
but I need to know more.

07:08.395 --> 07:09.692
All right, all right.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.422
- Take my sister, Joanie.
- All right.

07:11.564 --> 07:12.725
No, Mork, no.

07:12.866 --> 07:13.924
No, I didn't mean take her.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.432
I, well, put the fingers
in the ears,

07:15.568 --> 07:17.366
and I'll tell you something
about Joanie.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.938
(squeals)

07:19.072 --> 07:21.666
Who is this girl Jenny Picalow?

07:21.808 --> 07:23.367
Sounds like a good time
for anybody.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.103
(squealing)

07:25.245 --> 07:27.236
RICHIE: Now, Joanie was
real easy to handle

07:27.380 --> 07:28.905
<i>when she was a little girl.</i>

07:29.049 --> 07:31.416
<i>But then, uh, well,
what can I tell you?</i>

07:31.551 --> 07:32.780
<i>She grew up.</i>

07:32.919 --> 07:34.045
Definitely not!

07:34.187 --> 07:35.951
You are too young to car date.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.820
But Richie was younger than me
when you let him go.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.120
Tell him, Mom.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.160
(muttering)

07:42.295 --> 07:43.854
Yes, he was younger.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.055
Well, that's different.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.257
I mean, Richard is a-a-a boy.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.129
Oh, what's that got
to do with it?

07:49.269 --> 07:50.361
Yes, dear, she's right.

07:50.503 --> 07:51.868
What has that got to with it?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.770
Marion, get over here.

07:54.908 --> 07:58.344
Didn't you have a talk with her
about that?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.570
<i>Oh, that!</i>

07:59.713 --> 08:02.148
Well, I told her everything.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.545
Everything?

08:03.683 --> 08:05.674
Well, everything
I could remember.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.184
Hey, great costume.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.315
Are you going
as the Statue of Liberty?

08:15.261 --> 08:16.729
I'm Julius Caesar.

08:16.863 --> 08:17.989
What do you think of it?

08:18.131 --> 08:19.621
No wonder they stabbed him.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.902
She's getting such
a fresh mouth, Marion.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.701
She's starting to sound just
like your mother.

08:28.842 --> 08:29.968
Yeah.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.976
You're starting
to dress like her.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.511
- See you later!
- Howard.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.275
Hold it, hold it!

08:37.417 --> 08:40.114
Come over here.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.120
What is this?

08:43.256 --> 08:45.088
Who is this?

08:45.225 --> 08:47.353
Well, do you dig it?

08:47.494 --> 08:48.552
(chuckles)

08:48.695 --> 08:50.686
No, but I might bury it.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.832
RICHIE: But for a <i>kid</i> sister,
Joanie's great.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.438
(squealing)

09:00.673 --> 09:02.664
Whoa. I still respect you.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.777
No, uh, Mork,

09:08.915 --> 09:09.905
that-that's nothing.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.211
That's just a balloon.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.012
Oh, don't you have uh, you know,

09:13.153 --> 09:14.643
round things full
of hot air in the '70s?

09:14.788 --> 09:16.882
Yes, but they're called game
show hosts.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.416
Well, uh, anyway,
are you beginning to get,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.494
you know,
some idea about relationships?

09:22.629 --> 09:25.121
Yes, but I need to know more.
What about parents?

09:25.265 --> 09:27.063
Oh, all right, I'll tell you
about Mom and Dad.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.599
All right. (squealing)

09:29.769 --> 09:31.066
<i>RICHIE:
Their relationship is so good.</i>

09:31.204 --> 09:32.899
<i>They can work
out just about anything.</i>

09:33.039 --> 09:36.009
Howard, Jerry Helper was not
doing his Quasimoto joke.

09:37.477 --> 09:40.174
Marion, that man asked me

09:40.313 --> 09:42.304
to swing from the dinner bell!

09:44.317 --> 09:46.615
I'll never straighten up!

09:46.753 --> 09:48.221
Look on the bright side.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.288
- Now, you just relax.
-(groans)

09:50.423 --> 09:52.915
I'm going to go upstairs
and take a nice, warm bath,

09:53.059 --> 09:55.255
and put on
some Valentine perfume,

10:19.953 --> 10:21.182

Marion, will you go out

more comfortable way to chat?

Well, no.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.386
The blood is rushing to my head.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.118
I can't hear you,

Okay.

All right, um, uh, Fonz?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.532
A-As I was telling you, we were
talking about relationships.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.690
Yeah! Oh, hey, listen.
Cunningham and I have got

15:01.834 --> 15:04.701
-a long standing relationship.
You know, like friends? -Yeah.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.397
Paula Petrulunga

-if you get my drift.
- Yeah.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.273
Whoa, all right.
Tell him about it, will you?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.574
Yeah.

Two things I got to know.

15:24.791 --> 15:25.952
Cars and girls.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.664

16:12.738 --> 16:14.570

16:14.707 --> 16:16.038
- Yeah, yeah...
- You tell me when!

16:16.175 --> 16:17.370
- I've mixed it up a few times.
- When?

16:17.510 --> 16:18.944
- In the third grade, once...
- Oh, yeah?

16:19.078 --> 16:21.308
That's what I thought.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.506
Well, I can't remember them all.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.344
Then we became best friends.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.044
And he was always there
when <i>I</i> needed him.

what I'm gonna to you? -What?

16:29.856 --> 16:32.723
Rm gonna pop you one,

19:57.296 --> 20:00.322
Yes! Yes!

20:03.135 --> 20:05.536
<i>RICHIE: Sometimes making up
can lead to other things, too.</i>

20:05.671 --> 20:08.265
Marsha, Linda and I
were wondering

20:08.407 --> 20:10.375
if you guys
would like to, uh,

20:10.509 --> 20:12.637
make out?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.740
(roars)

20:29.495 --> 20:31.964
- You want to eat pie or kiss?
- Oh!

20:36.035 --> 20:38.834
Oh, Wilma,
your skin is so smooth.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.997
Hands off! That's me!

20:55.221 --> 20:57.417
Why don't you and I
go to the movies?

20:57.556 --> 21:01.083
Oh, no, I-l couldn't..

21:01.227 --> 21:02.752
What's playing'?

21:16.475 --> 21:18.466
(high-pitched humming)

21:20.279 --> 21:22.839
Oh, now I understand.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.643
Thank you.
It's-it's just so easy.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.082
Oh, so-so now you think
you understand relationships?

21:27.219 --> 21:28.516
- Oh, very, very much.
- Uh-huh.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.247
It's just very simple.
Now I know how to have one.

21:30.389 --> 21:31.481
Oh, thank you.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.457
Oh, Mork! Oh!

21:34.593 --> 21:35.458
Shoot, Mork!

21:35.594 --> 21:36.686
Oh?
- No, no.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.990
- It's just that...
- I did wrong?

21:38.130 --> 21:39.495
Well, yeah,
you don't go around...

21:39.632 --> 21:40.963
I'm glad they didn't see that.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.590
You need to spend
a little more time on Earth.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.533
Oh, I guess you're right.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.263
- It's a very complicated planet.
- Yeah, huh...

21:46.405 --> 21:48.203
There's a lot of things
I've got to learn.

21:48.340 --> 21:49.774
But thank you
for your help anyway.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.343
- That's okay.
- You've been fantastic.

21:51.477 --> 21:52.945
And I have to run right now
because I have to catch

21:53.078 --> 21:55.137
-the express egg, the scrambler.
- Oh.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.716
- Are you gonna, uh, you know,
disappear now? -Yes.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.340
- I have this fantastic
new way of doing it. -Yeah?

21:59.485 --> 22:01.214
- Look, over there!
- Wha...?

22:01.353 --> 22:02.650
Hey...

22:02.788 --> 22:04.483
Kind of a letdown.

22:04.623 --> 22:05.784
Mom?

22:05.925 --> 22:07.450

But this isn't
your day to report.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.587
I know that, sir.
I'm doing a spin-on

22:39.725 --> 22:41.090
to pay back for my spin-off.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.717
That's why I went
back to the 1950s.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.661
Wow, Tommy, that's a really
boss car, but what a drag.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.197
You put Vaseline
instead of 30 weight.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.700
But it's gonna have a really
nice D.A. for a carburetor.

22:49.835 --> 22:51.496
(high-voice):
Tommy, I'll still respect you.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.401
Wow, Mary Lou, that's a switch.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.007
You seem to like the '50s.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.404
Oh, yes, sir, it's a wonderful
naive and romantic time.

22:57.543 --> 23:00.274
That's why I'm sending you
this report on friendship.

23:00.412 --> 23:01.675
Whew!

23:01.814 --> 23:04.647
Oh, talk about your express.
You saved me a stamp there.

23:04.783 --> 23:05.944
You see, I went back to visit

23:06.085 --> 23:07.450
the Cunninghams
and their friends.

23:07.586 --> 23:09.452
They're really nice people,
but a little mondo mundane.

23:09.588 --> 23:12.387
You know, I'm talking
white bread and mayonnaise.

23:12.524 --> 23:13.889
They all seem to block out
one thing though.

23:14.026 --> 23:15.187
Senator McCarthy.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.352
Ah, yes. Those were sad days.

23:17.496 --> 23:18.930
Yeah, I guess so.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.156
I guess that's
why it's so romantic,

23:20.299 --> 23:22.097
because they never
remember the sad things.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.293
