WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:05.755
What are you doing?

00:06.131 --> 00:08.424
Dude, I'm freaked out about
my meeting with Michael

00:08.509 --> 00:10.635
and if I spend one more second
staring at Creepo the Clown

00:10.719 --> 00:11.677
I'm gonna lose it!

00:11.762 --> 00:14.180
You named the clowns?
- Psycho, Creepo

00:14.264 --> 00:17.225
Crazy Head, Stupid Juggling Weirdo,
Freaky Feet

00:17.601 --> 00:19.310
and Nightmare George Washington.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.312
One of them has to go.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.525
Oh. Sexy mailman.

00:25.776 --> 00:26.817
Much better.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.277
In five minutes, Michael wants my help

00:28.362 --> 00:30.196
investigating what's making
the Neighbourhood go nuts

00:30.697 --> 00:32.073
which is, obviously, me.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.491
I mean, I did promise I would help.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.700
What do I do here?

00:35.077 --> 00:39.205
Actually, the answer is...
- Right here?

00:39.331 --> 00:41.082
In this easily-understandable comic strip.
- Nope.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.209
In this book,
about the theory of contractualism.

00:43.502 --> 00:44.710
"What We Owe To Each Other?"

00:44.753 --> 00:45.878
I saw this movie.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.755
Laura Linney cries in a lake house

00:47.839 --> 00:50.049
because Jude Law left her
for his ex-wife's ghost.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.302
No. Quick summary of contractualism

00:53.345 --> 00:57.056
Uh, imagine a group of reasonable people...

00:57.349 --> 00:59.850
are coming up with the rules
for a new society.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.728
Like, "If your Uber driver talks to you,
the ride should be free."

01:02.813 --> 01:07.275
Sure. But anyone can veto
any rule that they think is unfair.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.401
So if you said

01:08.485 --> 01:12.572
"We should be able to break our promises
without any repercussions"

01:12.656 --> 01:15.449
someone would veto that rule.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.452
Well, my first rule would be
that no one can veto my rules.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.205
Well, that's called "tyranny,"
and it's generally frowned upon.

01:22.124 --> 01:24.834
If you make a promise to someone,
you should do it.

01:25.168 --> 01:30.256
Just like I promised to help you,
and still am, despite your constant mockery.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.966
"Despite your constant mockery!"

01:32.843 --> 01:34.969
Whatever. You love it. So...

01:35.345 --> 01:39.640
either I help him find the problem,
which is me, and I'm doomed.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.351
Or I don't help him

01:42.436 --> 01:44.186
and then I'm behaving unethically

01:44.271 --> 01:46.897
and the whole world goes crazy
and I'm caught anyway.

01:48.150 --> 01:52.820
I need to figure out a way to both help him
and not help him at the same time.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.281
That's literally not possible.
- Oh, really?

01:55.741 --> 01:58.367
I once posed as a hot prom date
for my cousin

01:58.744 --> 02:03.331
both helping him, and later, according
to his therapist, "not helping" him.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.180
Oh! Hey, Eleanor! Thanks for coming in.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.892
Sorry about the mess.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.728
Oh. I forgot you don't see in nine
dimensions.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.565
There's just a lot of tension
in the air right now.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.778
Are you okay, buddy?
You seem kind of stressed.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.614
No, no, no, no, I'm fine.
Top of my game actually.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.074
Here. Let me just, uh...

02:38.367 --> 02:39.950
Have a seat, Eleanor.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.410
There you go.

02:41.953 --> 02:45.331
So, to prepare to meet all of you

02:46.041 --> 02:49.502
I studied the human concept of "friends".

02:49.920 --> 02:52.672
I even watched
all ten seasons of the show Friends.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.258
Boy, those friends really were
friends, weren't they?

02:56.927 --> 02:59.762
Although... and I realise this is
the kind of observation

02:59.846 --> 03:03.182
that would only occur
to the mind of an eternal being -

03:03.809 --> 03:06.143
how did they afford that apartment?

03:07.270 --> 03:11.148
A waitress and a chef? With those
Manhattan real estate prices?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.651
Yeah, we were all confused about that, too.

03:13.735 --> 03:18.406
And why would they be jumping around
in a fountain if they also had umbrellas?

03:18.490 --> 03:21.450
I mean was the fountain full
because it had been raining? Or were they...

03:21.702 --> 03:23.869
Were they testing the durability of the
umbrellas?

03:24.413 --> 03:28.207
I don't know, man.
- Anyway, the reason why you're here is...

03:28.834 --> 03:31.711
- It's been a tough couple of days.

03:32.129 --> 03:37.091
And right now, I could really use
a "friend" by my side.

03:37.634 --> 03:43.139
Well, you know me, the person
who has audibly promised to help you.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.350
Dude, it's a sweet house.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.477
What did you pay for it?
Six hundred K?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.105
You know it's considered impolite
to ask that question?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.315
Well, I was being polite.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.359
I already "Zillowed" it, I know the price.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.487
So you need me to housesit the whole week?

03:59.197 --> 04:01.240
Sounds like somebody's gonna have
a sweet vay-cay!

04:01.366 --> 04:03.617
As I told you before, my mom is very sick.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.786
I'm going to help her move into
assisted living.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.539
Well, I'm here for you.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.167
And your Wi-Fi is way better
than my neighbour's, so I'm in.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.377
It's gonna mean taking care of Lester, too.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.088
Walk and feed him twice a day,
give him his kidney medicine.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.423
Yup, got it. Feed his kidneys.

04:17.799 --> 04:18.841
Eleanor?
- Yeah?

04:18.925 --> 04:20.885
This is gonna be
a very stressful week for me.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.511
I need to know that I can count on you.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.013
I'm not gonna let you down.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.306
I promise.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.226
I will faithfully protect this six hundred
and eighty thousand-dollar house.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.330
Oh! Sachveer, Jessica. Shopping for lunch?

04:49.706 --> 04:52.625
Yup! He loves to cook and I love to eat.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.002
He loves washing the dishes,
I love drying them.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.756
He loves putting them back in the cabinets,
I love closing cabinet doors.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.593
Yes, no, I see, you're... you soulmates.
It's so wonderful.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.012
Later we're going to the new spa
for the couples treatment.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.139
You should come and bring Jianyu.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.312
Jianyu, my love! How are you?

05:15.106 --> 05:16.941
I am decidedly so.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.693
That's very profound. Um..

05:19.986 --> 05:21.487
Soulmate, an idea!

05:21.822 --> 05:24.907
Our Neighbourhood now features a spa
and offers couples packages.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.536
And I thought maybe we could get facials
and do yoga

05:28.578 --> 05:32.248
and talk in long discursive sentences.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.333
What do you say?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.336
Signs point to yes.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.965
Oh! Marvelous. We'll go today.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.679
Dude, you gotta come with us to the spa.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.390
What? No. No way.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.850
No, that's really weird.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.602
You can't make small talk with her
for one day without being caught?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.396
No, I can't and she freaks me out!

05:55.564 --> 05:57.982
She's so pretty.
Like Nala, from The Lion King.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.192
And she talks so smart. Like, um...

06:01.069 --> 06:02.570
Nala, from the Lion King.

06:02.654 --> 06:03.445
You gotta help me.

06:03.530 --> 06:06.407
Well, if I feel sympathy for anyone,
it's Tahani.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.951
She's going through the same thing I am,
but she doesn't know it.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.996
Which means maybe I'm obligated to tell her?

06:12.581 --> 06:16.208
Although, maybe it's better not to know?
Is ignorance bliss?

06:16.334 --> 06:18.460
Or will the painful truth actually be...

06:18.545 --> 06:19.670
healing...
- Ready, Jianyu?

06:20.088 --> 06:24.466
Oh, I cannot wait to just relax
and talk and chat and just

06:25.218 --> 06:27.386
you know, get to know each other.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.471
Hey...

06:30.015 --> 06:31.807
Maybe I'll come too!

06:32.517 --> 06:34.643
Oh, Chidi.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.440
I... I would love your company.
It's just that this is, um...

06:39.941 --> 06:41.233
This is really more of a...

06:41.902 --> 06:43.527
couples thing.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.655
I know. But Eleanor's off with Michael

06:46.740 --> 06:49.950
and Jianyu feels comfortable
when I'm around. Right?

06:51.328 --> 06:53.621
Made in Taiwan.
- Yes, you were.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.332
You were made in Taiwan, so...

06:56.958 --> 06:59.585
couples date! Let's go!

07:01.838 --> 07:04.965
I never really looked around your office
the first day.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.175
What is all this junk?

07:06.968 --> 07:10.679
Well, technically, architects aren't allowed
to own any human objects, but...

07:11.640 --> 07:13.307
I just love them so much.

07:13.642 --> 07:14.850
And over here, look at this.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.978
Aren't paperclips the most amazing
things in the world?

07:18.063 --> 07:20.481
Yeah. Sure.
- Anyway...

07:20.815 --> 07:23.776
my current theory is that
some object in the Neighbourhood

07:23.860 --> 07:26.820
has a design flaw, which is causing
everything to go haywire.

07:26.905 --> 07:30.491
So we need to find that object.
We're gonna start with the rocks!

07:30.575 --> 07:34.161
Now I've investigated all of the rocks
in the Neighbourhood

07:34.496 --> 07:37.206
these seventy-eight are the most suspicious.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.793
Maybe to an "Architect" they might
look suspicious

07:40.919 --> 07:43.921
but to me they just look like rocks.
So I'm not sure how I can help.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.466
Do any of them look defective, sinister?

07:47.550 --> 07:51.470
You know, like they're taunting you,
always one step ahead.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.682
Oh, you devious little monsters, you.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.483
Hello, Janet. Jianyu and I are here for
the couples' package, please.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.111
And also I will be joining them.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.113
Great! And who is the other half
of your couple?

08:09.656 --> 08:12.908
Oh, no, no, it's just me.
- Couples are pairs of people.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.995
Yup! And... uh, there is a pair
of people, Tahani and Jianyu.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.998
And then also I am here.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.249
Great! And who will be joining you?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.711
No one. Um, it's...
It's really quite simple, Janet.

08:23.795 --> 08:28.590
They are a couple, and I am a third part
of that couple

08:28.842 --> 08:33.012
a helper part who is here
for fun and excitement.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.346
It's a three-person couple!

08:35.765 --> 08:37.349
Does not compute.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.268
Does not compute.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.395
Does not compute.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.231
I'm just kidding.

08:44.566 --> 08:47.526
I mean, it doesn't compute,
but I'm not gonna explode or anything.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.738
Right. Well. I'll see you inside, darling.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.075
Okay, you have to step up.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.579
Find a way to connect with her without,
you know, being you.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.332
But what does that even mean?
Do I talk or not talk?

09:02.751 --> 09:06.086
Do I be nice to Tahani, or do I
throw all her jewellery in the toilet?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.172
That's the opposite of "being nice?"

09:08.423 --> 09:09.465
So no toilet?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.676
Okay. So we have two piles.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.721
Seemingly fine, where we have placed

09:16.765 --> 09:18.932
three of the rocks, and...

09:19.726 --> 09:23.812
further examination needed,
where we've placed the other seventy-five.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.275
Only ninety minutes in and we're eliminated
three rocks. We're making progress.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.489
Although, I have to say I'a little suspicious
of the second one right here.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.992
Could we just move that back in the
further examination needed?

09:37.077 --> 09:41.997
You... you... you need to chill a little
'cause you have a very psycho, burnout

09:42.082 --> 09:46.126
guy muttering to himself
at a library computer" type of vibe.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.587
I cannot stop until I find the problem.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.965
I just... it's my responsibility
to solve the problem.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.094
What else can I do, except keep working?

09:57.263 --> 09:59.348
You could stop working.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.975
Look, I promised to help you and,
honestly

10:02.060 --> 10:04.478
the way I can help you
is to force you to take a break.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.606
And not working will help me work?

10:07.690 --> 10:10.734
Yes. Recharge the old batteries.

10:10.819 --> 10:15.072
I promise, this is gonna help
both of us. Let's go.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.199
Okay.

10:17.992 --> 10:22.371
Let's keep our eyes peeled
for twigs that may have a nefarious agenda.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.081
Okay, crazy, come on.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.710
What is it with you and frozen yogurt?

10:29.462 --> 10:30.879
Have you not heard of ice cream?

10:31.005 --> 10:33.465
Oh, sure.
But I've come to really like frozen yogurt.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.718
There's something so human about
taking something great

10:37.178 --> 10:39.638
and ruining it a little,
so you can have more of it.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.306
That is very human.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.643
Why do you need a human to be your assistant?

10:44.853 --> 10:49.523
I mean, aren't there more of
whatever you are?

10:50.066 --> 10:52.317
Well since we're becoming "friends"

10:53.319 --> 10:54.778
like Ross and Phoebe

10:54.904 --> 10:56.446
Weird combo to pick, but okay.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.823
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.328
Usually Architects don't live
in their Neighbourhoods.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.081
Usually, the people show up,
we play the movie

11:06.708 --> 11:09.418
Janet is there to answer questions,
and you're on your own.

11:09.752 --> 11:10.961
But I had this theory.

11:11.045 --> 11:15.257
I thought transition would be easier
if the Architect were on site

11:15.508 --> 11:17.050
for at least the first thousand years or so.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.888
That's why you've been so freaked out,
'cause your butt is on the line.

11:24.851 --> 11:25.893
Do you have a butt?

11:27.395 --> 11:28.896
Well I thought I did. Ouch.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.607
No, I'm sorry. It's a great butt. I...
- No I'm...

11:32.275 --> 11:34.234
just... this is weird.
- Anyway...

11:34.569 --> 11:38.322
my boss thought I was nuts,
and if this Neighbourhood doesn't work

11:38.406 --> 11:40.574
I am in big trouble.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.453
Just like Chandler and Joey
when they left Ross's baby on a bus.

11:44.746 --> 11:49.917
But more importantly, I promised all of you
that you would be safe and happy

11:50.043 --> 11:51.877
and you just don't break a promise.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.964
Unlike Ross, when he promised Emily
not to talk to Rachel.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.383
Wow, you are really into that show.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.969
You know something? I feel better already.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.639
Should we get back to work?
Gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah!

12:03.806 --> 12:06.391
The whole point is to stop thinking
about work

12:06.893 --> 12:07.893
and start having fun.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.437
Now, what should we do first?

12:10.897 --> 12:16.485
♪ I'm going out in a blaze of glory ♪

12:16.694 --> 12:20.364
♪ Lord, I never drew first
But I drew first blood ♪

12:20.573 --> 12:22.199
♪ I'm no one's son ♪

12:22.617 --> 12:25.577
♪ Call me young gun ♪

12:27.205 --> 12:28.956
This is so interesting.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.960
I mean there's no point to it,
the images on the screen relate to nothing

12:33.711 --> 12:35.254
some time passed, and then it was over!

12:35.755 --> 12:37.923
That's karaoke!
- Let's do it again.

12:40.718 --> 12:44.638
Okay! My hands are heated to the ideal
one hundred and five degrees.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.223
Who would like to go first?

12:46.307 --> 12:48.225
Oh well, uh... what if I go first, and then

12:48.309 --> 12:50.227
perhaps Jianyu could stand near me and

12:50.395 --> 12:52.145
share some intimate aspects of his life?

12:56.859 --> 12:58.986
Or what if

13:00.154 --> 13:02.614
while Janet massages Tahani

13:02.740 --> 13:05.993
I massage Jianyu?

13:10.581 --> 13:12.541
Jianyu, darling, let's discuss the arts.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.503
I adore the Impressionists.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.674
Who's your favourite artist?
- I mean...

13:21.050 --> 13:23.302
- Pitbull changed the game...
- Hm.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.929
Sorry. I was working the...

13:26.848 --> 13:29.349
oft-neglected mandible area.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.940
Oh, man!

13:37.275 --> 13:39.943
I didn't even want that thing,
why am I trying to win it?

13:40.028 --> 13:41.903
Because the machine says it's a prize.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.239
- Oh!
- Boom!

13:44.324 --> 13:45.699
How many tickets do I get?

13:45.783 --> 13:47.909
Six? Is that all?
- Well... watch this.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.372
Is that allowed?
- Not really.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.082
But it is a time-honoured tradition.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.043
Say no more. I got it. I got it.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.297
Yow!
- Whoo!

14:01.257 --> 14:02.299
You know something?

14:02.383 --> 14:04.718
As much as I've always wanted
to be around humans

14:04.802 --> 14:08.138
I think I've missed a big part
of what makes them wonderful.

14:08.431 --> 14:12.476
Sometimes all you guys think about
is how you can have the most fun!

14:12.894 --> 14:17.272
Exactly! That was practically my mantra.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.025
What's up, dongbait?

14:20.109 --> 14:21.735
Drop everything you're doing.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.906
Rihanna is performing in Vegas.
I got tickets. We are road tripping!

14:25.990 --> 14:27.449
Aw, I can't.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.536
I promised I'd housesit one more day,
and I have to feed this stupid dog.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.873
I'm sorry, does this dog smoke blunts
topless on a yacht, like a boss

14:34.916 --> 14:35.999
'cause that's how RiRi do.

14:36.542 --> 14:40.295
That's a very good point.
- This is floor-seats, in Vegas, for Rihanna!

14:40.380 --> 14:41.963
The booze is free there.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.966
Do I really need to keep going?

14:47.303 --> 14:50.138
Okay. This is dinner tonight,
breakfast tomorrow.

14:50.431 --> 14:51.473
I have an idea. This is in case of emergency.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.769
This is in case of emergency.

14:55.812 --> 14:59.022
Do not eat this unless it's an emergency.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.609
Wow. I'm ready to be a mom.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.161
I'm having trouble getting
this mask to stick.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.123
Yes, it's because my pores are just so small.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.084
There's no way anything can ever adhere
to my skin.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.460
It's a curse, really.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.089
Jianyu?
What are your pores like?

15:27.718 --> 15:29.845
Seemed like such an easy question to answer.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.889
Janet, can you show me to the sauna, please?

15:37.520 --> 15:40.480
Dude! She's trying so hard,
and you're giving her nothing.

15:40.565 --> 15:43.859
Just pick a fact that you know about her
and just muddle through. She...

15:44.193 --> 15:46.194
She said she likes impressionist
paintings.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.656
Oh! Impressionist paintings?
Okay, say no more!

15:50.074 --> 15:53.368
No, no. I definitely feel like I need to say
more. Jia--?

15:54.328 --> 15:55.912
So...

15:56.747 --> 15:58.498
would you say I helped you today?

15:58.583 --> 16:03.003
Oh, so much! I had fun,
I didn't think about my problems and I...

16:03.296 --> 16:05.130
I won this ugly yellow toddler

16:05.214 --> 16:07.424
which is one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.427
Eleanor, thank you for being a friend.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.513
You're a pal and a confidante.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.349
After you watched Friends,
did you also watch Golden Girls?

16:16.434 --> 16:17.851
Yes, I did.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.979
They love cheesecake
and one of them loves intercourse.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.232
All right. I'll see you tomorrow, friend.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.374
You sure this
is where you want to be right now?

16:42.210 --> 16:45.086
At the "Tea for Two" Couples' Café.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.047
There's no use avoiding it, Chidi.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.632
I'm alone.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.676
Jianyu and I have nothing in common.

16:51.802 --> 16:55.347
I just want a soulmate.
Someone I can share my passions with

16:55.431 --> 16:58.600
someone who I can talk to about
the ethereal colours of a Degas.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.726
I love Degas!

16:59.810 --> 17:02.979
I took painting lessons as a kid,
and Degas was always my inspiration.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.357
What's your favourite work?
- Let's say it on three.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.610
Okay.
- One, two, three.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.070
The Absinthe Drinker
- Ballet Dancers in the Wings

17:11.364 --> 17:13.490
Well, at least we both still like Degas.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.952
Yes! And do you like France as much as I do?

17:17.078 --> 17:21.081
Well, they enslaved my country
for three hundred years, so no.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.292
But they have great museums.
- Yes.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.628
Welcome to my café you two!

17:26.712 --> 17:30.423
We have a special on soulmate muffins:
two for the price of zero.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.842
Everything is free.
- Oh, uh... well, we're not soulmates.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.469
- No.
- We're just, uh...

17:34.554 --> 17:36.555
- Soul friends.
- Oh.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.687
Hey, buddy! I have all new fun stuff
for us to do today.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.897
Also, you think you didn't do any work?

17:46.107 --> 17:49.025
Wait till you see how much work
<i>the Real Housewives don't do.</i>

17:49.318 --> 17:51.444
Eleanor... Eleanor, I have huge news.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.739
"Not working" actually worked.

17:54.907 --> 17:55.949
It did what now?

17:56.033 --> 17:58.868
After our day off,
with a completely clear head

17:59.287 --> 18:03.665
I realised part of what makes humans
so fun is that they're unpredictable.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.501
The chaos we've been experiencing

18:06.586 --> 18:11.047
is exactly what would happen
if a resident behaved unpredictably.

18:11.132 --> 18:15.427
The problem in our Neighbourhood,
it's not a rock or an object...

18:15.970 --> 18:17.554
it's one of the people.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.848
Oh! We need to celebrate!

18:20.391 --> 18:23.893
Okay. Whoo-hoo! Paperclip shower!

18:28.065 --> 18:31.651
So, do you think we're looking for a man?
Or do you think we're looking for two men?

18:32.320 --> 18:35.322
Not sure.
We don't know anything about this person.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.324
I mean does he or she

18:37.408 --> 18:40.285
even know that they caused
all these problems?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.162
No, that can't be.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.081
I mean what kind of monster
would wreak havoc and then say nothing?

18:45.166 --> 18:48.209
There are nice monsters, like Elmo.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.046
Elmo? I'm not familiar with that.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.589
Let me just quickly...

18:54.717 --> 18:57.802
Elmo's delightful.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.221
Uh-oh.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.975
They're over-using him.
He's gotten annoying.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.727
Oh, well, too bad.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.103
Anyway, back to the hunt.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.523
So this is the main place
where the garbage fell from the sky.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.567
Janet?
- Hi there.

19:12.735 --> 19:17.072
I need a list of everyone that was here
on garbage duty during Orientation.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.782
Oh!

19:20.201 --> 19:21.242
Eleanor.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.412
- Our criminal is on this very short list.
- Hm.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.707
People were flying that day, too.
I'll add everybody who flew overhead.

19:28.459 --> 19:33.129
Our criminal is on this much longer list.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.594
Oh, hey, homey.
Thanks for your advice.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.805
I'm about to give Tahani the best gift ever.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.931
Check it.

19:45.017 --> 19:49.437
What? I mean, what?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.022
She likes impressionist paintings, right?

19:51.148 --> 19:54.401
I got her a painting of
the best impressionist of all time.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.527
Frank Caliendo.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.822
He can do it all: Fat Al Pacino,
Fat Jerry Seinfeld, Regular John Madden--

19:58.864 --> 20:04.202
Jianyu, I need you to take
this oil painting of Frank Caliendo

20:04.328 --> 20:07.080
and put it in a very dark room
where no one will ever see it.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.082
Perfect. It glows in the dark. Watch.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.129
Huh?

20:14.964 --> 20:17.674
Forget about it, forget about it.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.008
Huh?

20:20.344 --> 20:24.013
Okay, so the opening night party
won't help us narrow our list

20:24.098 --> 20:25.932
because, well... everyone was there.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.767
Right. Everyone was there.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.311
Everyone drank the appropriate
amount of alcohol.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.814
So that seems like a dead end.
- But...

20:34.150 --> 20:39.821
This is where the sinkhole opened up,
and the guest list that night was limited.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.991
There were a total of 30 people that night.

20:45.286 --> 20:46.494
Only thirty, huh?

20:46.620 --> 20:49.122
Yay! How do you pump your fist again?

20:50.708 --> 20:51.750
Is this it?

20:51.834 --> 20:55.128
But sixty-six others passed through
to take a look before it opened.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.006
And everyone else in the Neighbourhood
was in a close radius.

20:58.090 --> 21:02.427
Oh, boy!
That doesn't narrow it down at all.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.472
Feels like the end of the road.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.893
End of the Road. Boyz II Men.
Karaoke!

21:10.269 --> 21:12.103
Let's go.
Don't think about it too much.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.313
Janet.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.565
My hoodie please.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.572
What's happening?
- I give up.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.701
I can't help the people
I promised that I would help.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.748
I feel like Friends in season eight

21:32.708 --> 21:38.004
out of ideas and forcing Joey and Rachel
together even though it made no sense.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.675
I hope the sinkhole opens up again
and swallows me whole.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.481
Paula! Hey, girl! How's the dog?

21:56.857 --> 21:59.317
Still fat, Eleanor. Still fat.

22:00.069 --> 22:03.530
The vet said his stomach expanded
to the size of a basketball.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.323
And that it will never shrink.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.534
Mmm. Well, that's not my fault.

22:07.618 --> 22:11.412
How was I supposed to know
he would literally eat all of the food?

22:11.497 --> 22:13.081
It shouldn't have been an issue.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.292
You were supposed to be there
but you broke your promise

22:16.669 --> 22:21.881
as soon it wasn't convenient for you,
and now I have a very bulbous dog.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.343
Well, you know what?
You're rude.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.513
'Cause you didn't even ask me
how the Rihanna concert was.

22:29.473 --> 22:33.184
She was very late and a little drunk.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.527
I promised to help you, and I will

22:43.320 --> 22:44.362
however I can.

22:44.864 --> 22:49.576
If you want to look at a million rocks
like a psychopath, I'll be there.

22:49.910 --> 22:54.289
If you want to just lay here
and cry in your hoodie, I'm cool with that.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.125
Honestly, I don't know how I can help you

22:57.751 --> 22:59.794
'cause I'm just a person

22:59.879 --> 23:05.216
and you're like this super, magical,
Orville Redenbacher type guy

23:05.384 --> 23:07.927
who invented this entire universe

23:08.053 --> 23:10.179
but I'll do my best.

23:11.932 --> 23:12.974
I'm right here.

23:13.726 --> 23:14.976
Oh, my gosh...

23:18.772 --> 23:19.856
Of course.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.358
How did I not see it?

23:22.985 --> 23:26.821
Janet, I've found the answer to the problem.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.114
Call a Neighbourhood meeting.

23:28.657 --> 23:32.493
Should it be "Festive and Casual,"
or "Moribund and Devastating?"

23:32.578 --> 23:35.079
Moribund and Devastating, please.
- Great!

23:42.087 --> 23:43.713
Hello, Jianyu. Chidi.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.886
What's this?
- I made you a "art".

23:50.179 --> 23:54.599
It's three of me! As ballerinas!

23:54.934 --> 23:57.101
Painted in the style of the impressionists!

23:57.353 --> 23:58.394
Of course!

23:59.605 --> 24:03.358
You don't say things, but you do things

24:03.776 --> 24:05.401
and you feel things.

24:06.737 --> 24:10.740
Only my true soulmate could ever give me
such a perfect gift.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.408
Thank you.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.210
Do you need anything else from me?

24:22.795 --> 24:26.547
No, no. I just want you to stand right there.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.804
What's going on?
- Well, I did what you said.

24:32.888 --> 24:36.516
I honoured my agreement to help
Michael find the problem

24:36.558 --> 24:40.061
and he found the problem.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.187
Oh, I'm so sorry.

24:43.232 --> 24:46.317
Maybe I broke my promise, too.
I agreed to help you.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.654
Don't worry, you did.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.659
After I'm gone,
take down the rest of those clown paintings.

24:55.077 --> 24:59.664
But leave up the sexy mailman,
to remember me by.

25:00.916 --> 25:04.085
Thank you all for your patience
with the problems in our Neighbourhood.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.171
I have finally discovered the cause.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.259
There was one common link
among every incident.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.595
And when I figured it out it was a shock

25:14.930 --> 25:16.305
but there's no escaping it

25:18.183 --> 25:19.225
the problem...

25:20.602 --> 25:21.644
is me.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.187
And now...

25:24.690 --> 25:27.567
I have to leave you, forever.
