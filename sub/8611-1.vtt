NARRATOR:
During the Civil War, the only
lawmen in Southern Texas--

00:25.072 --> 00:30.874
the Texas Rangers-- disbanded
to fight for the Confederacy.

00:30.911 --> 00:35.211
Ranger Captain LeanderMcNelly
was also the local preacher.

00:35.248 --> 00:40.743
He left his family and ministry
to fight alongside his men.

00:40.787 --> 00:44.951
After the war, McNelly
returned to a defeated Texas

00:44.991 --> 00:48.119
and found his wife
and three sous gone--

00:48.161 --> 00:51.255
taken by bandits.

00:51.298 --> 00:53.823
In the ten years
since the war's end

00:53.867 --> 00:56.062
bandits have overrun
southern Texas.

00:56.103 --> 00:59.595
Now, the governor
is looking for McNelly.

00:59.639 --> 01:04.132
They say he wants to
recommission the Texas Rangers.

01:04.177 --> 01:07.169

in the distance )

01:07.214 --> 01:09.307

02:04.037 --> 02:05.129
Leander...

02:05.172 --> 02:07.140
you know,
that's a right pretty spot

02:07.174 --> 02:08.869
for a resting place.

02:08.908 --> 02:10.705
Who's the grave for?

02:10.744 --> 02:13.372
The grave's for me.

02:13.413 --> 02:14.903
Wait too long

02:14.948 --> 02:16.745
ground'll be froze.

02:16.783 --> 02:20.549
Leander, come spend the winter
at my ranch.

02:20.587 --> 02:22.953
You rode down,
we'd have a place for you.

02:22.989 --> 02:24.479
Be like old times.

02:24.524 --> 02:27.550
I don't reckon
I'll last the winter.

02:27.594 --> 02:29.824
Governor said
he sent some of his men.

02:29.863 --> 02:31.728
you wouldn't show at the door.

02:31.765 --> 02:33.790
Said maybe you'd auswer for me.

02:33.834 --> 02:36.962
The governor
just wants to talk with you.

02:37.003 --> 02:38.561
you don't got to say

02:38.605 --> 02:41.130
yes or no
or it's a cold September.

02:41.174 --> 02:44.075
All you got to do is see him,
Leander.

02:59.993 --> 03:02.826
( stagecoach rattling )

03:13.173 --> 03:15.505
Hyah! Hyah!

03:27.687 --> 03:30.315
And never underestimate
the importance of the name

03:30.357 --> 03:31.949
that you choose for a product.

03:31.992 --> 03:33.118
"The Dunnison and Sous

03:33.159 --> 03:35.024
"Automatic Drawer

03:35.061 --> 03:36.995
for the Tabulation
of Financial Trausactious."

03:37.030 --> 03:38.827
That just about tells the story,
doesn't it?

03:38.865 --> 03:40.799
Every shopkeeper in the country
will want one

03:40.834 --> 03:42.461
( chuckling )
--before they even see it.

03:42.502 --> 03:44.834
Well, that's good, because
the prototype doesn't work.

03:44.871 --> 03:47.101
It's a prototype, son,
it's not supposed to work.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.801
That's why they call it
a prototype.

03:48.842 --> 03:50.332
Look at this.

03:50.377 --> 03:52.038
I've already come np
with a solution

03:52.078 --> 03:53.841
to the prob...

03:58.118 --> 03:59.813
It's for your mother.

03:59.853 --> 04:02.822
Why didn't you mail it
while we were in Austin?

04:02.856 --> 04:04.687
you'll see.

04:12.198 --> 04:14.257
( men hollering and whistling )

04:19.639 --> 04:21.766
( mooing )

04:31.117 --> 04:32.277
Past 4:00, Marshall.

04:32.319 --> 04:33.547
We should get started

04:33.587 --> 04:36.055
before these buyers
get even more nervous.

04:36.089 --> 04:37.317
I got a bad feeling.

04:37.357 --> 04:39.723
you just got to border
country today, Marshall.

04:39.759 --> 04:40.885
you'll get used to it.

04:40.927 --> 04:42.292
Coming down.

04:42.329 --> 04:45.264
There you go.

04:46.733 --> 04:47.529
Lincoln!

04:49.002 --> 04:51.061
Mother? Jake?

04:51.905 --> 04:53.202
Oh, thank goodness.

04:53.239 --> 04:54.638
Oh...

04:54.674 --> 04:56.266
( chuckling )

04:56.309 --> 04:57.435
Look how tall you've gotten.

04:57.477 --> 04:59.945
--Nice hat.
--Little brother.

04:59.980 --> 05:01.641
What? you're going
to be a lawyer?

05:01.681 --> 05:03.512
--I just might.
--How beautiful.

05:03.550 --> 05:04.608
Oh, you still quick?

05:04.651 --> 05:06.881
Come on, boy.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.512
( quiet laugh )

05:08.555 --> 05:09.613
( clanging )

05:12.592 --> 05:13.991
I'd like to thank

05:14.027 --> 05:16.188
all of you for coming here today
for the first

05:16.229 --> 05:17.787

05:31.645 --> 05:34.512

05:39.586 --> 05:41.554
What's your business here,
Fisher?

05:41.588 --> 05:43.351
Come for my beeves.

05:43.390 --> 05:45.824
This here's an auction.

05:45.859 --> 05:48.225
you're welcome to bid
when the time comes.

05:48.261 --> 05:50.161
I bid 50.

05:50.196 --> 05:51.527
50 what?

05:51.564 --> 05:52.690
50 of them.

05:52.732 --> 05:55.098

06:43.750 --> 06:45.741
FISHER:
Marshall, I don't
think you understand.

06:45.785 --> 06:49.346
around here,
I'm the law.

06:52.926 --> 06:55.451
Now, I'm taking
my beeves home.

06:57.897 --> 07:00.661
I can't let you
take these cattle.

07:02.769 --> 07:06.034

08:09.936 --> 08:11.369
MAN:
All right, all of you,
fan out!

08:11.404 --> 08:14.237
Come on! Come on!

08:16.876 --> 08:18.104
Hyah!

08:18.144 --> 08:19.941

08:19.979 --> 08:22.971
Come on, let's
get out of here!

09:53.573 --> 09:55.939
Is anyone here?

10:09.822 --> 10:11.016
Don't move and I'll shoot!

10:12.191 --> 10:14.591
Don't move and you'll shoot?

10:14.627 --> 10:15.719
What does that mean?

10:15.762 --> 10:17.821
If I don't move,
you're going to shoot me?

10:17.864 --> 10:19.798
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

10:19.832 --> 10:22.596
My name is
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.

10:22.635 --> 10:26.799
you understand, I'm not
one of the men who did this...

10:26.839 --> 10:30.434
so I'll be on my way.

10:30.476 --> 10:33.343
( whimpering softly )

10:37.116 --> 10:39.744
I can't lift it free.

10:39.786 --> 10:42.016
I can help you.

10:45.792 --> 10:48.124
Put down the gun.

10:48.161 --> 10:51.221
( hammer uncocks )

10:51.264 --> 10:52.788
I'm from Missouri.

10:52.832 --> 10:54.800
We was on a cattle drive

10:54.834 --> 10:58.634
and stopped for supplies,
and we got ambushed.

10:58.671 --> 11:02.266
They stole all the cattle
and killed everybody.

11:02.308 --> 11:03.832
Didn't kill you.

11:03.876 --> 11:05.104
I was trapped...

11:05.144 --> 11:06.304
and they didn't see me

11:06.346 --> 11:08.041
and I'm damn lucky
that was the case

11:08.081 --> 11:09.742
otherwise, I'd
be dead too.

11:09.782 --> 11:12.012
So, where you headed?

11:12.051 --> 11:13.313
Browusville.

11:13.353 --> 11:15.913
Browusville?
What's there?

11:15.955 --> 11:18.355
Texas Rangers
are recruiting.

11:18.391 --> 11:20.154
Texas Rangers?!

11:20.193 --> 11:22.457
I'm going with you.

11:22.495 --> 11:24.292
We'll get them bandits.

11:24.330 --> 11:27.163
It's a long way
to Browusville.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.395
I got a horse.

11:33.039 --> 11:35.234
Name's George Durham.

11:49.589 --> 11:52.057
( coyote howls )

11:54.961 --> 11:57.122
( bird hooting )

12:00.767 --> 12:02.291
Not so used

12:02.335 --> 12:04.360
to sleeping under the stars,
are you?

12:04.404 --> 12:07.339
( howling and barking )

12:11.711 --> 12:16.410
Well...
there's nothing to it, really.

12:16.449 --> 12:18.974
just, uh, dig yourself
a little hip hole

12:19.018 --> 12:20.280
and then you fill a bandanna

12:20.319 --> 12:21.946
full of saw grass

12:21.988 --> 12:25.424
and stick that
underneath your head.

12:25.458 --> 12:28.552
It's the Lord's country,
Lincoln.

12:28.594 --> 12:32.655
Yeah... Lord's country.

12:32.698 --> 12:35.667
Land this beautiful...

12:35.701 --> 12:38.067
ain't no wonder

12:38.104 --> 12:40.197
everybody's
killing over her.

12:42.508 --> 12:44.601
( coyote howling )

12:44.644 --> 12:47.909
She's been here
a long time before us.

12:47.947 --> 12:49.141
She'll be here

12:49.182 --> 12:52.709
a long time to come.

12:52.752 --> 12:56.415
you are a philosopher,
George Durham.

12:57.723 --> 12:59.452

MAN:
We're going
to protect

13:19.812 --> 13:22.508
you people,
least you can do

13:22.548 --> 13:23.981
is contribute supplies.

13:24.016 --> 13:25.608
you want a starving army?

13:25.651 --> 13:28.119
Who's going to keep
the crops safe then?

13:28.154 --> 13:28.984
you fellas there

13:29.021 --> 13:30.648
grab all the grub
you can carry.

13:30.690 --> 13:31.987
Get your irons and fall in.

13:32.024 --> 13:33.719
We're riding south
to kill bandits!

13:43.436 --> 13:45.563
( townsfolk murmuring )

13:47.773 --> 13:49.673
Afternoon, Rangers.

13:51.844 --> 13:53.971
What's your business here?

13:54.013 --> 13:55.412
By order of the community

13:55.448 --> 13:57.609
I've got a vigilance committee
formed.

13:57.650 --> 14:00.118
Nary a Yankee, nigger
or Mexican among us.

14:00.153 --> 14:02.314
unless you have
the authority of the state

14:02.355 --> 14:03.913
disband and disarm these men.

14:03.956 --> 14:05.548
They won't have it.

14:05.591 --> 14:07.058
We aim to protect
our land.

14:07.093 --> 14:08.958
Men who want to protect
their land

14:08.995 --> 14:10.758
they can apply to hire from me.

14:10.796 --> 14:12.764
Governor's commissioned
the Rangers

14:12.798 --> 14:14.766
to do the
protecting, mister.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.769
Now, you disband these men.

14:19.805 --> 14:22.205
you from San Antone?

14:23.242 --> 14:25.005
'Cause you
sure as hell

14:25.044 --> 14:28.480
remind me
of this preacher there.

14:28.514 --> 14:31.074
It was some years ago...

14:31.117 --> 14:33.051
some preacher man.

14:33.085 --> 14:36.350
I don't recall no time
in San Antone.

14:36.389 --> 14:38.448
No, I suppose you don't.

14:44.730 --> 14:48.962
Men, you can keep your guns
to guard your homes

14:49.001 --> 14:52.061
but that means
go home.

14:52.104 --> 14:53.594
( crowd murmuring )

14:53.639 --> 14:56.540
I'll give you one minute
to take a vote.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.621
Hey, Preacher...

15:15.661 --> 15:17.060
vote's in.

15:23.202 --> 15:24.863
Preacher...

15:24.904 --> 15:26.428
( gasping )

15:26.472 --> 15:28.133
say me last rites, Preacher

15:28.174 --> 15:30.165
before he takes me.

15:30.209 --> 15:32.473
I ain't no preacher.

15:35.748 --> 15:39.081
Company's making camp,
two nights in Brownsville.

15:39.118 --> 15:42.246
Any of you men interested
in taking on the star?

15:42.288 --> 15:45.587
West end of town's
where you'll find us.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.889
you look for me,
Leander McNelly

15:47.927 --> 15:49.087
or my associates

15:49.128 --> 15:51.255
Sergeant
John Armstrong

15:51.297 --> 15:52.730
or Frank Bones.

15:54.767 --> 15:57.258

16:01.974 --> 16:04.067
DRIVER:
Hyah, hyah!

16:07.213 --> 16:10.341
( wagon squeaking and rattling )

16:19.859 --> 16:22.760
Whoa-whoa. Whoa.

16:26.666 --> 16:28.133
?Habla ingles?

16:28.167 --> 16:30.431
?Mexicano?

16:30.469 --> 16:32.334
The big villas are north, yes?

16:32.371 --> 16:34.066
you asking or telling?

16:34.106 --> 16:36.666
That is what we want.

16:36.709 --> 16:39.075
I thought the cattles,
you drive them north, too.

16:39.111 --> 16:40.840
With many peoples.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.438
With iron trains.

16:42.481 --> 16:43.505
That is what we want.

16:43.549 --> 16:44.777
These beeves
don't speak ingles.

16:44.817 --> 16:47.945
They speak, uh...
espanol.

16:47.987 --> 16:49.318

16:49.355 --> 16:51.482
What do you want for her?

16:51.524 --> 16:53.651
The tigre is not for sale,
senor.

16:53.693 --> 16:54.751
What about her?

16:55.761 --> 16:58.559
She is my wife, senor.

16:58.597 --> 16:59.689
What's she do?

17:01.400 --> 17:02.697
What's she do?!

17:02.735 --> 17:04.464
She acrobat, senor.

17:04.502 --> 17:06.936
She spins and balances
and juggles.

17:06.972 --> 17:08.769
Well, if she can juggle
three balls in the air

17:08.808 --> 17:11.367
without dropping one of them,
you can keep your tomcat.

17:11.410 --> 17:13.002
( chuckles )

17:15.647 --> 17:18.674
Perdita, andele.

17:29.161 --> 17:30.526
Mas alto.

17:30.563 --> 17:31.655
Mas alto, Perdita.

17:38.571 --> 17:39.970
( screams )

17:40.005 --> 17:41.233
Catch it!

17:50.683 --> 17:51.809
Hyah!

17:54.387 --> 17:55.820
( screams )

17:59.425 --> 18:00.483
( gunshot )

18:00.526 --> 18:01.618
( chuckles )

18:07.500 --> 18:08.797
Name?

18:08.834 --> 18:10.426
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.

18:11.570 --> 18:13.504
Where you from,
Mr. Dunnison?

18:13.539 --> 18:15.029
From Philadelphia, sir, as a boy

18:15.074 --> 18:17.838
but I spent the last three years
traveling with my father

18:17.877 --> 18:19.003
a salesman and inventor.

18:19.044 --> 18:20.341
Where's he now?

18:20.379 --> 18:21.744
He's dead, sir.

18:21.781 --> 18:23.749
He was shot down by bandits.

18:23.783 --> 18:25.410
Ain't no revenge riding,
Mr. Dunnison.

18:25.451 --> 18:27.351
Yes, sir.

18:27.386 --> 18:28.819
Saddle up.

18:33.459 --> 18:35.086
When Frank here says
draw, you draw.

18:35.127 --> 18:36.560
Takes longer than
a half a second

18:36.595 --> 18:37.857
means you're dead.

18:39.298 --> 18:41.858
That Ranger badge
is your target.

18:56.348 --> 18:57.747
Sarsaparilla.

19:00.653 --> 19:02.143
Most boys draw on sarsaparilla.

19:03.689 --> 19:04.986
Draw, damn it.

19:09.895 --> 19:11.487
The gun doesn't seem
to be loaded, sirs.

19:11.530 --> 19:13.657
Son, you might want
to cock the hammer.

19:18.604 --> 19:20.299
How'd he do?

19:20.339 --> 19:21.829
Nine seconds.

19:21.874 --> 19:23.341
Seen worse.

19:23.375 --> 19:25.468
Gentlemen, you've been gracious
to grant me your time.

19:25.511 --> 19:27.035
I wish you the best
in your endeavors.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.747
Give my best to Philadelphia.

19:32.952 --> 19:36.115
just so there are
no hard feelings either way

19:36.155 --> 19:38.680
I didn't come here
for a mouth's pay

19:38.724 --> 19:40.055
or to execute
some bandits

19:40.092 --> 19:41.286
like they did
my family.

19:41.327 --> 19:43.227
I came here
because you sent out for men

19:43.262 --> 19:44.889
who wanted to protect
their land.

19:44.930 --> 19:46.989
I have no land
but the patch

19:47.032 --> 19:48.363
my own two feet stand on

19:48.400 --> 19:50.766
but I would want that land
to be lawful, sir.

19:50.803 --> 19:54.204
you put that down in writing,
Mr. Dunnison?

19:54.240 --> 19:55.639
Sir?

19:55.674 --> 19:57.266
That high-minded talk.

19:57.309 --> 19:59.106
you write like that, too?

19:59.144 --> 20:02.580
In English, French or Latin?

20:02.615 --> 20:05.209
Well, shit, Mr. Dunnison.

20:05.251 --> 20:07.947
I only know Spanish,
Cherokee and Comanche.

20:07.987 --> 20:11.115
$40 a mouth in a state scrip
and found.

20:11.156 --> 20:13.317
you'll get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.

20:13.359 --> 20:14.883
you'll get your orders
from me.

20:14.927 --> 20:16.952
We'll sell you the boots,
sell you a gun

20:16.996 --> 20:18.224
sell you a steed.

20:18.264 --> 20:20.129
but it'll run you $40,
Mr. Dunnison

20:20.165 --> 20:22.633
so you better last a mouth...

20:22.668 --> 20:25.831
'cause you're in debt to me
already.

20:28.107 --> 20:29.631
Here you are.

20:29.675 --> 20:30.835
Thanks.

20:33.145 --> 20:34.840
Wear it proud, son.

20:46.859 --> 20:49.054
Sergeant.

20:51.430 --> 20:53.489
( stnttering ):
Name's Sam from
S-S-San Antone.

20:53.532 --> 20:55.591
I never been
to S-S-San Antone.

20:55.634 --> 20:57.067
Randolph Douglas Scipio

20:57.102 --> 20:59.002
from around
the Texarkana way.

20:59.038 --> 21:00.733
My daddy staked
some land out there.

21:00.773 --> 21:02.673
Turned out to find himself
a copper mine

21:02.708 --> 21:04.608
so they killed my daddy.

21:04.643 --> 21:06.907
you shouldn't be able
to just shoot a man

21:06.946 --> 21:08.004
and claim his land.

21:08.047 --> 21:09.344
Yeah.

21:09.381 --> 21:10.575
Yeah, I aim to
change that.

21:10.616 --> 21:12.106
So, uh, Sergeant say

21:12.151 --> 21:14.847
whether he'll use you as
a rifleman or a scout?

21:14.887 --> 21:17.549
A rifleman or a scout?

21:17.590 --> 21:19.922
Well, every white
boy I met yet

21:19.959 --> 21:22.587
says Sergeant
made him a rifleman.

21:22.628 --> 21:24.789
Every colored, like me

21:24.830 --> 21:27.628
Sergeant made a scout.

21:27.666 --> 21:29.031
Well, every war
I ever heard of

21:29.068 --> 21:30.763
scouts get killed
before the shooters

21:30.803 --> 21:33.135
'cause they're the stupid son
of a bitches sent out front.

21:33.172 --> 21:35.140
And if I don't meet
some white boy scouts soon

21:35.174 --> 21:37.904
President Grant's
going to be hearing from me.

21:37.943 --> 21:39.410
Sure.

21:39.445 --> 21:41.675
A strongly worded letter's
always best.

21:41.714 --> 21:44.478
They say I'm a scout?

21:44.516 --> 21:46.882
you see this star here?

21:48.621 --> 21:51.488
I'm gonna show them
I'm a shooter.

21:51.523 --> 21:53.957
Dunnison.

21:55.561 --> 21:57.028
What do you think, huh?

21:57.062 --> 21:58.222
( snorts )

21:58.263 --> 22:00.128
George!

22:00.165 --> 22:02.099
Lincoln! Lincoln!

22:02.134 --> 22:03.158
Lincoln!

22:03.202 --> 22:04.430
We're Rangers!

22:04.470 --> 22:05.528
We made it!

22:05.571 --> 22:07.402
( laughing )

22:07.439 --> 22:09.304
We're not sleeping
under the stars.

22:09.341 --> 22:10.467
We got a tent.

22:10.509 --> 22:11.840
Oh, it's nice, too.

22:11.877 --> 22:13.469
you got to see it.

22:13.512 --> 22:14.501
( laughing )

22:14.546 --> 22:15.843
It's a tent!

22:15.881 --> 22:18.111
I got my be...
I'm on the left!

22:18.150 --> 22:20.414
BONES:
Fisher's been splitting

22:20.452 --> 22:21.942
his men into several bands.

22:21.987 --> 22:23.614
They've been
raiding ranches

22:23.656 --> 22:25.647
all along this trail
on the way to Mexico.

22:25.691 --> 22:28.216
GnARD:
Captain? Mr. Dunnison's
reporting, sir.

22:28.260 --> 22:29.488
Send him in.

22:29.528 --> 22:30.927
Captain.

22:30.963 --> 22:32.624
Sergeant said
you wanted to see me.

22:32.665 --> 22:33.996
Thanks, Frank.

22:36.535 --> 22:39.936
Take a seat, Mr. Dunnison.

22:39.972 --> 22:42.270
Notebook and pen are yours.

22:46.278 --> 22:48.940
Every word I say,
you write it down.

22:48.981 --> 22:51.472
Something slips by,
slow me down.

22:51.517 --> 22:53.508
Understood, sir.

22:53.552 --> 22:56.282
October 26.

22:56.321 --> 22:58.186
Company now
fully outfitted

22:58.223 --> 23:00.248
with 30 men,
orphans mostly.

23:00.292 --> 23:01.816
youngest 15.

23:01.860 --> 23:05.091
We'll leave tomorrow
and train on the trail.

23:05.130 --> 23:08.065
Fisher split his men
into smaller raiding parties.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.830
Lord hope that we're
not attacked directly.

23:10.869 --> 23:12.530
( McNelly coughing )

23:12.571 --> 23:15.062
Scant trail
experience

23:15.107 --> 23:17.701
weakness with weapons...

23:17.743 --> 23:20.610
Expect desertions along the way.

23:20.646 --> 23:25.083
Expect... expect most of
these boys will not survive.

23:29.221 --> 23:31.689
( coughing )

23:31.724 --> 23:33.021
Sir?

23:34.793 --> 23:36.351
I'm capable
of writing

23:36.395 --> 23:38.727
my reports to the government,
Mr. Dunnison.

23:38.764 --> 23:40.857
but there will come a time
when I am not.

23:40.899 --> 23:43.493
I'd rather have you
in the habit.

23:46.338 --> 23:48.499
( coughing )

23:56.381 --> 23:58.679
( gasping )

24:04.890 --> 24:08.587
The Lord is coming for me,
Mr. Dunnison.

24:08.627 --> 24:12.529
Sir, then why ride?

24:12.564 --> 24:16.330
I figure it's better
I walk to meet Him...

24:17.803 --> 24:21.034
...than sit and wait.

24:24.009 --> 24:26.239
Hey.

24:26.278 --> 24:28.803
What'd the captain want?

24:33.719 --> 24:36.882
He's dying.

24:36.922 --> 24:41.120
Our captain is dying.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.891
Rangers!

24:42.928 --> 24:46.489
Our mission is to stop

24:46.532 --> 24:48.796
the outlaw John King Fisher.

24:48.834 --> 24:51.530
Fisher and his men
have been burning ranches

24:51.570 --> 24:54.232
thieving cattle and
driving them into Mexico

24:54.273 --> 24:56.366
where he sells them
to the Mexican army.

24:56.408 --> 24:58.638
More than a million
beeves stolen.

24:58.677 --> 25:00.975
More than
400 men murdered.

25:01.013 --> 25:03.447
We'll be patrolling
border country

25:03.482 --> 25:05.313
to find these animals,
bring them to justice.

25:05.350 --> 25:07.443
U.S. Cavalry's
got a mandate

25:07.486 --> 25:09.477
to settle Indian matters.

25:09.521 --> 25:12.012
Leaves us to protect
the Texan way.

25:12.057 --> 25:13.718
It's our home, Rangers

25:13.759 --> 25:16.193
and we got right
on our side.

25:16.228 --> 25:18.219
Ain't no outlaw
stands a fighting chance!

25:18.263 --> 25:19.594
( gunshots )

25:19.631 --> 25:21.861
( cheering and whooping )

25:33.812 --> 25:35.439
( crowd cheering )

25:49.595 --> 25:52.758
( cheering coutinues )

26:07.379 --> 26:09.506
( bridle clanking )

26:25.063 --> 26:27.293
( horse burring )

26:38.810 --> 26:40.368
Back up, recruit!

26:40.412 --> 26:42.141
This ain't no
goddamn pony ride.

26:42.180 --> 26:43.772
Who you calling recruit?

26:43.815 --> 26:45.180
you're a Browusville sign-up.

26:45.217 --> 26:46.912
I seen you. I been a Ranger
since Franklin.

26:46.952 --> 26:48.579
That's a week and two days.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.554
I know about life on the trail.

26:50.589 --> 26:52.420
One more week, you'll be
eligible for retirement.

26:52.457 --> 26:53.583
Watch it, recruit.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.115
I'll shoot that lip off
at 40 paces.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.958
Name's Berry.
Berry Smith.

26:57.996 --> 27:00.157
Berry? Like blueberry?

27:00.198 --> 27:01.529
Like elderberry to you.

27:01.566 --> 27:03.227
Sergeant sent me
to fill out the dab.

27:03.268 --> 27:05.566
Dab's a usual
three or four Rangers.

27:05.604 --> 27:07.003
We eat together, scout together.

27:07.039 --> 27:09.701
It's us three
and Sandoval.

27:09.741 --> 27:10.901
He's dab leader.

27:10.943 --> 27:12.535
Means we care
for his horse

27:12.577 --> 27:13.874
care for his weapons.

27:13.912 --> 27:17.177
( gunshots )

27:17.215 --> 27:21.242
( whooping and cheering )

27:31.630 --> 27:33.427
( gunshot )

27:38.103 --> 27:40.833
Boy rides a horse like
he's riding his sister.

27:40.872 --> 27:42.806
He knows he's doing
something wrong.

27:42.841 --> 27:46.004
Ten cents says
he's saddle sore.

27:46.044 --> 27:48.239
20 cents says he's
dead by Sunday.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.770
Ain't taking that bet.

27:54.619 --> 27:57.281
Anybody see the way this scout
killed those bandits?

27:57.322 --> 27:58.516
Anybody see the way
this scout

27:58.557 --> 28:00.047
killed those bandits?

28:03.395 --> 28:05.886
( rapid gunfire )

28:05.931 --> 28:07.762
Damn!

28:07.799 --> 28:09.494
Sam, I'll bet you I can draw

28:09.534 --> 28:11.866
faster than you can say
"peppercorn."

28:11.903 --> 28:12.767
Peppercorn.

28:12.804 --> 28:13.532
just say it.

28:13.572 --> 28:15.199
Pep-pep-pep-pep-pep...

28:15.240 --> 28:17.435
( gunshots )

28:19.611 --> 28:20.373
Fast!

28:20.412 --> 28:22.073
I'm fast, I'm fast

28:22.114 --> 28:24.173
--I'm fast!
--So fast you're six feet under.

28:24.216 --> 28:26.241
Missed that target
every time, Mr. Durham.

28:26.284 --> 28:28.616
gun's no good unless
you got smarts with it.

28:28.653 --> 28:29.711
Yes, sir, Captain.

28:29.755 --> 28:30.813
Frank, from now on

28:30.856 --> 28:33.450
Mr. Durham pays
for his ammunition.

28:33.492 --> 28:35.221
A penny a miss.

28:35.260 --> 28:36.522
Yes, sir, Captain.

28:44.836 --> 28:45.860
( gunshots )

28:45.904 --> 28:47.838
( tin can falling )

28:55.113 --> 28:58.549
Peppercorn.

28:58.583 --> 29:02.485
FISHER:
I'm telling you,
General Cortinas

29:02.521 --> 29:04.887
the Republic of Texas
is there for the taking.

29:04.923 --> 29:08.256
What you're suggesting
is full-scale war.

29:08.293 --> 29:10.261
The union Army's up north,
fighting the Indians.

29:10.295 --> 29:11.990
Hell, there ain't no law
south of Austin.

29:12.030 --> 29:13.361
We heard McNelly's
been commissioned

29:13.398 --> 29:14.365
to start up the Rangers.

29:14.399 --> 29:16.594
McNelly's got 30 men,
General, 30.

29:16.635 --> 29:17.727
We'd have an army.

29:19.838 --> 29:24.707
For the next shipment, senor...

29:24.743 --> 29:27.177
we will meet you.

29:29.948 --> 29:31.779
--Shit!
--Damn, Dunnison.

29:31.817 --> 29:33.614
Ain't there anything
you're good at?

29:33.652 --> 29:35.552
I'd love to show you, Scipio,
but I don't think

29:35.587 --> 29:37.316
we'll be meeting any women
along the way.

29:37.355 --> 29:39.255
Dunnison, you rope
yourself a woman

29:39.291 --> 29:42.522
I'll drink the Rio Grande.

29:42.561 --> 29:43.994
( laughing )

29:44.029 --> 29:45.621
( chuckling )

29:55.006 --> 29:57.600
you want something, Sam?

29:57.642 --> 30:00.873
( stuttering ):
When you're wri-wri-writing

30:00.912 --> 30:03.005
for the Captain in his tent

30:03.048 --> 30:07.314
you see any ma-ma-maps in there?

30:07.352 --> 30:08.944
Maps?

30:08.987 --> 30:14.015
I seen the ma-maps he s-studies
with the s-sergeant

30:14.059 --> 30:15.424
and they're pretty b-b-b...

30:15.460 --> 30:17.826
Bad, Sam?

30:17.863 --> 30:19.490
Mm-hmm.

30:19.531 --> 30:21.761
My pa-pa-papa taught me

30:21.800 --> 30:25.827
how to blaze t-t-trails
and k-k-keep maps.

30:25.871 --> 30:28.271
Might be
wo-wo-worthwhile

30:28.306 --> 30:30.866
having somebody
to ma-ma-make maps

30:30.909 --> 30:32.467
of the t-t-territory

30:32.511 --> 30:34.411
while we ride.

30:34.446 --> 30:36.937
Dunnison:
Captain, Mr. Walters
was speaking to me

30:36.982 --> 30:39.109
about the charts and maps
you're working with

30:39.151 --> 30:40.778
and he wanted
to present you

30:40.819 --> 30:43.219
with what we think
is a preferable scenario.

30:43.255 --> 30:44.745
Sam.

30:44.789 --> 30:48.156
W-W-Well...

30:48.193 --> 30:51.026
Captain, I w-w-wanted

30:51.062 --> 30:54.031
to s-s-see...

30:54.065 --> 30:57.193
I w-wanted to s-see

30:57.235 --> 30:58.600
if you're the kind of man

30:58.637 --> 31:00.434
who'd beg for his
life like a dog

31:00.472 --> 31:03.066
or swallow the bullet
like a sorry soldier.

31:03.108 --> 31:05.599
( grunts and groans )

31:05.644 --> 31:08.204
Stay down!
Stay down, you son of a bitch.

31:10.348 --> 31:11.246
Well...

31:11.283 --> 31:13.843
Captain Cutthroat McNelly--

31:13.885 --> 31:16.752
the man the whole union
Army conldn't kill.

31:16.788 --> 31:19.279
Shot down by Sam Walters

31:19.324 --> 31:20.518
of San Antone.

31:20.559 --> 31:21.856
Fisher knows

31:21.893 --> 31:23.588
you're riding the Rangers,
Captain.

31:23.628 --> 31:25.391
He's put a sweet price
on your sad hide.

31:26.464 --> 31:27.726
( pained groaning )

31:27.766 --> 31:28.926
Suck my spurs,
you secretary!

31:28.967 --> 31:31.299
I brought a bullet
for you, too.

31:32.537 --> 31:33.902
Turn around, McNelly.

31:33.939 --> 31:35.702
And stop your shifting
or I'll shoot.

31:35.740 --> 31:39.904
Brave Sam Walters--
shot McNelly in the back.

31:39.945 --> 31:41.173
( groaning )

31:41.213 --> 31:43.545
How's that
for a storybook?

31:43.582 --> 31:45.948
Turn around, McNelly.

31:45.984 --> 31:48.043
Right in the back,
Sam shot him.

31:48.086 --> 31:49.485
Right in the back.

31:49.521 --> 31:50.920
I said

31:50.956 --> 31:52.014
turn around!

31:54.626 --> 31:56.719
( gasps )

32:20.652 --> 32:23.519
( sighs quietly )

32:31.796 --> 32:33.525
( clicks tongne )

32:33.565 --> 32:35.192
( horse whinnies )

32:36.668 --> 32:39.296
you riding somewheres,
Mr. Dunnison?

32:40.605 --> 32:42.596
Riding out
of Ranger Company, sir.

32:42.641 --> 32:44.973
Company's captain

32:45.010 --> 32:47.274
was nearly killed
due to my conduct.

32:47.312 --> 32:50.440
I don't presume myself welcome
to wear this anymore.

32:53.418 --> 32:57.013
Were you set to ride off
with that horse, Mr. Dunnison?

32:57.055 --> 32:58.989
That's a Ranger's horse.

32:59.024 --> 33:01.652
I was hoping I would not be
sent away without a horse, sir.

33:01.693 --> 33:03.490
but hoping to be sent away?

33:03.528 --> 33:08.397
you were nearly killed,
and I was the reason.

33:08.433 --> 33:10.458
I hired Sam Walters on,
Mr. Dunnison.

33:10.502 --> 33:12.060
He stood my scrutiny.

33:12.103 --> 33:14.765
He could've taken his shot at me
at any time.

33:14.806 --> 33:17.297
He had 30 Rangers shined on,
not just you.

33:17.342 --> 33:19.435
Rangers' horse,
Mr. Dunnison.

33:19.477 --> 33:22.446
you ride out,
that horse is stolen.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.607
My men will hunt you down.

33:24.649 --> 33:28.016
Rangers' boots, Rangers'
clothes, Rangers' weapons.

33:28.053 --> 33:30.613
you walk out,
makes them stolen, too.

33:30.655 --> 33:32.452
So it seems to me,
Mr. Dunnison

33:32.490 --> 33:34.424
the only way you
escape a warrant

33:34.459 --> 33:36.120
is to remain a Ranger.

33:46.638 --> 33:48.902
( hooves thundering )

33:59.217 --> 34:02.118
Fisher keeps an outpost
around this mesa.

34:02.153 --> 34:05.088
Freshwater spring
on the other side.

34:05.123 --> 34:08.388
Water for the horses when
they come from raids.

34:08.426 --> 34:11.259
but do we know
how many?

34:11.295 --> 34:12.820
shouldn't we know how many?

34:12.864 --> 34:14.228
Round that mesa

34:14.264 --> 34:15.891
they'll spot us
well too soon.

34:15.934 --> 34:17.299
Need to send a patrol.

34:17.335 --> 34:21.362
Berry, Durham, Dunnison

34:21.406 --> 34:22.737
ride with Sandoval and me.

34:22.774 --> 34:25.504
Taking a scout, Captain?

34:27.112 --> 34:28.773
Get yourself shot.

34:28.813 --> 34:31.179
Scipio, go get yourself shot.

34:31.216 --> 34:34.049
And don't get shot second;
get shot first, Scipio.

34:34.085 --> 34:36.143
In fact, shoot yourself, Scipio.

34:36.187 --> 34:37.916
Get it over with.

34:37.956 --> 34:40.389
That's the Rangers' way.

34:40.425 --> 34:43.053
( men talking in distance )

34:59.778 --> 35:02.838
( horse approaching )

35:04.949 --> 35:06.974
Five men. Fisher's men, sir.

35:07.018 --> 35:09.578
Armed, and they got
a supply wagon.

35:10.622 --> 35:12.487
--Sandoval.
--Yes, sir.

35:13.458 --> 35:15.688
our mission is

35:15.727 --> 35:17.388
to capture these men
at all costs.

35:17.429 --> 35:19.727
but I want the cost
to be on their side.

35:19.764 --> 35:21.493
When the shooting starts,
these targets

35:21.533 --> 35:23.262
will be shooting back--
not like practice, men.

35:23.301 --> 35:24.928
Anyone surrenders,
we question them

35:24.969 --> 35:26.561
then send them to
Austin for trial.

35:26.604 --> 35:27.798
Remember...

35:27.839 --> 35:30.103
you hesitate, you're dead.

35:32.911 --> 35:35.812
( neighing )

35:39.818 --> 35:42.116
( neighs )

35:44.255 --> 35:46.553
Where are you wandering
off to, huh?

35:46.591 --> 35:47.853
Cheval, huh?

35:47.892 --> 35:49.655
What woman

35:49.694 --> 35:50.956
lost hold of you, huh?

35:50.995 --> 35:53.395
Drop your guns! Stay down!

35:53.431 --> 35:54.796
Texas Rangers!

35:57.068 --> 35:58.626
Say your prayers,
sons of bitches!

35:58.670 --> 35:59.432
Ambush!

36:08.646 --> 36:09.806
( neighing )

36:14.085 --> 36:16.212
( yelling )

36:33.638 --> 36:37.130
Someone throw me a cartridge!
I'm out!

36:37.175 --> 36:38.972
Someone throw me

36:39.010 --> 36:40.238
a cartridge!

36:45.350 --> 36:47.079
Found one.

36:55.126 --> 36:56.753
Wha... uh...

36:58.596 --> 37:00.291
( yells )

37:00.331 --> 37:02.231
( crying )

37:07.739 --> 37:09.707
( both groaning )

37:13.044 --> 37:14.341
( rapid gunfire )
--Get down!

37:29.561 --> 37:32.655
you said there were
five men! Five!

37:32.697 --> 37:34.062
I ain't no scout!

37:34.098 --> 37:35.497
you hear me?
I ain't no scout!

37:35.533 --> 37:36.830
I'm a dag-blasted shooter!

37:36.868 --> 37:37.926
Give me that!

37:47.245 --> 37:49.076
We surrender.

37:49.113 --> 37:51.013
We surrender.

37:53.785 --> 37:55.275
( sighs )

37:55.320 --> 37:58.346
So, ladies, where to next?

37:59.891 --> 38:01.358
Say your names.

38:01.392 --> 38:03.326
Anton Marsele,
from New Orleans.

38:03.361 --> 38:05.352
Jean-Pierre Marsele.
Son frere.

38:05.396 --> 38:08.058
Marsele brothers.

38:08.099 --> 38:10.761
Horse thievery
and livestock

38:10.802 --> 38:12.827
extortion of
merchants and widows

38:12.870 --> 38:14.565
kidnapping...

38:14.606 --> 38:17.006
destruction
of property.

38:17.041 --> 38:18.736
you boys should've stayed
in New Orleans.

38:18.776 --> 38:20.437
Why don't you give us
some more to write in here?

38:22.547 --> 38:24.242
( men gasping, horses neighing )

38:24.282 --> 38:26.182
Attendez! Attendez! Attendez!

38:26.217 --> 38:27.206
We rode for King Fisher.

38:27.251 --> 38:28.650
The saddles were stole

38:28.686 --> 38:30.415
from Sutter Ranch
in Austin.

38:30.455 --> 38:32.116
With cattle, 400 head.

38:32.156 --> 38:34.590
Ten ranch hands died
at the Sutter Ranch.

38:34.626 --> 38:35.820
We kill no one.

38:35.860 --> 38:37.191
Fisher did.

38:37.228 --> 38:38.388
We work for you now.

38:38.429 --> 38:39.418
--For you.
-- Oui.

38:39.464 --> 38:41.329
you work for the Rangers
as a spy?

38:41.366 --> 38:42.833
-- Oui.
-- Oui. Oni, for the Rangers.

38:42.867 --> 38:43.925
For the Rangers.

38:43.968 --> 38:45.401
Ca va marcher,
ca va marcher.

38:45.436 --> 38:46.835
Ils savent pas
a propos des antres.

38:46.871 --> 38:48.338
C'etait pas marqne
daus le mandat.

38:48.373 --> 38:50.102
Mr. Dunnison?

38:50.141 --> 38:52.268
--Sir?
--What'd they say?

38:52.310 --> 38:54.676
They said, "This will work,
this will work.

38:54.712 --> 38:56.612
"They don't know
about the others.

38:56.648 --> 38:58.741
It wasn't in the warrants."

39:01.686 --> 39:02.948
Sandoval.

39:04.322 --> 39:06.950
( men gasping, horses neighing )

39:08.626 --> 39:11.288
( choking and gasping )

39:12.730 --> 39:14.994
These bandits
went down shooting.

39:15.033 --> 39:16.557
Surrender never crossed
their minds.

39:16.601 --> 39:18.626
Their rules, not mine.

39:18.670 --> 39:20.194
but I'll play by them.

39:20.238 --> 39:22.069
We're Rangers, men.

39:22.106 --> 39:25.507
We got right
on our side.

39:28.579 --> 39:31.139
Scipio.

39:35.286 --> 39:37.777
Treat her fine...

39:37.822 --> 39:39.346
rifleman.

39:43.961 --> 39:46.862
Dunnison:
you said we would take
those men prisoner

39:46.898 --> 39:49.423
take them to Austin,
take them to trial.

39:49.467 --> 39:51.992
We did the trial.

39:52.036 --> 39:53.663
That was no trial.

39:53.705 --> 39:57.698
A trial can run a long
time, Mr. Dunnison.

39:57.742 --> 39:59.835
Some can run
up to a year.

40:03.681 --> 40:06.377
A year is something
I do not have.

40:06.417 --> 40:08.248
In the state of Texas,
killers hang.

40:08.286 --> 40:10.880
And if they're not killers,
but we think they're killers

40:10.922 --> 40:13.618
and we don't even stop
to check the warrants?

40:13.658 --> 40:16.092
How long will the war go on...

40:16.127 --> 40:18.186
preacher?

40:22.500 --> 40:24.730
until the wicked are dead

40:24.769 --> 40:27.033
and the meek shall
inherit the earth.

40:27.071 --> 40:29.369
Are we the meek?

40:29.407 --> 40:32.774
The meek will inherit the earth,
Mr. Dunnison.

40:32.810 --> 40:36.302
Someone's got to go
and get it ready for them.

40:36.347 --> 40:38.474
There are bodies

40:38.516 --> 40:40.950
to be buried.

40:40.985 --> 40:42.680
Bury them.

40:51.662 --> 40:53.630
( coughs and spits )

40:57.969 --> 41:00.199
( retching )

41:00.238 --> 41:02.331
( flies buzzing )

41:15.953 --> 41:17.944
Some kind of work, ain't it?

41:17.989 --> 41:22.153
We done killed six men dead.

41:22.193 --> 41:25.924
We ain't even got our $40 yet.

41:29.100 --> 41:32.900
( hooves thundering )

41:41.946 --> 41:46.110
< <

42:06.904 --> 42:09.668
Cattle come through here.

42:09.707 --> 42:12.005
100, maybe 200.

42:17.748 --> 42:21.047
Whoa, now! Get on back!

42:25.723 --> 42:29.318
Rangers got
the Marsele brothers.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.089
What about the gun?

42:31.128 --> 42:33.358
McNelly destroyed it.

42:34.632 --> 42:36.122
Damn.

42:42.573 --> 42:44.234
30 men and horses.

42:44.275 --> 42:46.266
about a hundred beeves.

42:46.310 --> 42:48.870
you know that's
marshland prairie, Captain.

42:48.913 --> 42:52.076
Might want to track them
to a little better terrain.

42:52.116 --> 42:54.641
No better terrain for 20 miles.

42:54.685 --> 42:57.381
And better for us
means better for them.

42:57.421 --> 42:58.615
Might be better to wait.

42:58.656 --> 43:01.147
Wait till what,
they reach reinforcements?

43:01.192 --> 43:02.523
Sandoval??

43:02.560 --> 43:07.520
30 of them, 30 of us.

43:07.565 --> 43:11.626
We wait...
they may have 300.

43:19.243 --> 43:22.269
We'll ride
at full gallop.

43:22.313 --> 43:23.871
They'll see us
on the prairie

43:23.915 --> 43:25.473
and take
defensive positions.

43:25.516 --> 43:27.347
Shoot at the target
forward of you only

43:27.385 --> 43:28.374
and you keep shooting

43:28.419 --> 43:30.910
till you taste that
outlaw's blood.

43:30.955 --> 43:33.389
No prisoners, Rangers.

43:55.479 --> 43:58.880
( men shouting )

44:04.922 --> 44:05.616
Fire!

44:25.843 --> 44:27.310
Hyah!

44:29.613 --> 44:30.841
Get every last one!

44:38.689 --> 44:39.883
( screaming )

44:39.924 --> 44:42.119
Get the others out of hiding.

44:49.133 --> 44:51.101
Let's go, boys!

44:51.135 --> 44:55.401
( all shouting )

44:55.439 --> 44:57.498
( gunshots coutinue )

45:05.349 --> 45:06.748
Jesus Christ.

45:14.525 --> 45:15.617
( horse whinnies )

45:18.162 --> 45:20.027
( grunting )

45:24.368 --> 45:26.199
We don't have the manpower.

45:26.237 --> 45:28.034
They set us up!
We're trapped!

45:30.474 --> 45:31.839
( screaming )

45:31.876 --> 45:32.638
( neighs )

45:32.676 --> 45:33.768
( screaming )

45:38.482 --> 45:39.676
( screaming )

45:43.587 --> 45:45.452
Goddamn.

45:45.489 --> 45:47.389
( yells )

45:48.359 --> 45:49.986
( horse whinnies )

45:53.731 --> 45:55.096
God, not me.

45:55.132 --> 45:57.930
Oh, please God!

45:57.968 --> 45:59.458
Oye, muchacho, por aca.

46:01.939 --> 46:02.769
Stand back!

46:02.807 --> 46:04.104
Stand back!

46:05.976 --> 46:07.443
Don't move!

46:10.181 --> 46:12.706
Oh, God! Oh, God! Get up!

46:12.750 --> 46:14.183
( gun cocking )

46:17.488 --> 46:18.785
( horse whinnies )

46:24.261 --> 46:26.388
Leave them alone!

46:26.430 --> 46:27.920
Their dead alone!

46:30.935 --> 46:31.765
( groans )

46:43.114 --> 46:44.206
No!

46:49.653 --> 46:51.348
Sergeant!

46:51.388 --> 46:52.753
I'm getting you
out of here.

46:52.790 --> 46:55.122
Help me! I surrender!

46:55.159 --> 46:56.251
Help me!

46:56.293 --> 46:57.453
I surrender!

46:57.495 --> 46:58.427
Help me!

46:58.462 --> 47:00.430
I surren--

47:02.299 --> 47:03.630
Retreat, Rangers!

47:03.667 --> 47:04.929
Retreat!

47:09.740 --> 47:11.970
( gunshot rings out )

47:25.156 --> 47:27.021
Durham:
Thank God!

47:27.057 --> 47:28.046
We're retreating!

47:28.092 --> 47:29.992
Come on!
We're retreating!

47:30.027 --> 47:31.324
We're retreating!

47:31.362 --> 47:32.522
Giddup! Let's go!

47:41.872 --> 47:44.170
Next time you train your Rangers

47:44.208 --> 47:45.641
train them
how to run!

47:45.676 --> 47:47.610
Go with God, McNelly.

47:47.645 --> 47:50.443
If the son of a bitch
will have you.

47:52.716 --> 47:55.014
Ride.

47:55.052 --> 47:56.849
( horse whinnies )

48:06.530 --> 48:08.623
( birds chirping )

48:13.204 --> 48:16.503
( chirping coutinues )

48:30.588 --> 48:33.648
( whispers ):
Thank you very much.

48:46.904 --> 48:50.362
Fisher will have
ridden on by dusk.

48:50.407 --> 48:53.205
We'll return to Palo Alto...

48:53.244 --> 48:55.804
get our men.

48:55.846 --> 48:58.542
We'll resupply
and get new recruits

48:58.582 --> 49:00.550
at the ranch
of my old friend

49:00.584 --> 49:01.881
Richard Dukes.

49:19.103 --> 49:21.162
What'd they do with our men?

49:22.339 --> 49:24.569
Cap...

49:43.560 --> 49:46.529
Cut my men down.

49:46.563 --> 49:49.123
Cut them down.

50:00.611 --> 50:02.806
Jesus...

50:14.358 --> 50:15.552
Captain!

50:15.592 --> 50:17.617
or favor...

50:17.661 --> 50:18.628
kill me.

50:18.662 --> 50:19.788
Captain!

50:19.830 --> 50:21.161
Kill me now.

50:21.198 --> 50:22.460
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

50:22.499 --> 50:24.763
Slow and easy,
?comprende?

50:24.802 --> 50:26.963
Nice and easy,
little lady.

50:27.004 --> 50:28.301
your war's over.

50:30.808 --> 50:32.742
Slow and easy.

50:48.892 --> 50:51.452
( men yelling and whistling )

50:51.495 --> 50:53.087
MAN:
Riders coming in!

50:53.130 --> 50:54.427
Ready yourselves!

50:54.465 --> 50:56.865
Begging your pardon,
Mrs. Dukes.

50:56.900 --> 50:58.629
There's riders, Captain.

51:10.814 --> 51:13.647
Whoa.

51:19.690 --> 51:21.715
Are those the Rangers,
Daddy?

51:21.759 --> 51:24.023
Caroline,
take your sisters inside.

51:24.061 --> 51:25.688
Come on, girls.
There's going to be

51:25.729 --> 51:27.287
a lot of dirty cowboys around.

51:33.904 --> 51:36.634
Got 12 men to bury.

51:58.862 --> 52:02.161
you want to say
some words, Leander?

52:18.182 --> 52:20.309
( sniffling )

52:24.321 --> 52:25.754
WOMAN:
you're welcome, sir.

52:25.789 --> 52:27.381
( indistinct conversation )

52:32.162 --> 52:34.528
Oh, thank you,
ma'am.

52:34.565 --> 52:36.556
No, no.

52:41.205 --> 52:43.139
( belches )

52:43.173 --> 52:45.004
Thank you, ma'am.

52:45.042 --> 52:46.566
Tom?

52:49.947 --> 52:51.915
wouldn't be so bad
to be a ranch hand

52:51.949 --> 52:53.143
around here,
would it?

52:53.183 --> 52:54.741
Probably don't
get shot at much.

52:54.785 --> 52:56.252
I wouldn't even
mind, as long

52:56.286 --> 52:58.083
as it was her
doing the shooting.

52:58.121 --> 52:59.418
( laughing )

52:59.456 --> 53:01.321
Durham:
up there earlier

53:01.358 --> 53:04.919
she was studying me
like an encyclopedia.

53:04.962 --> 53:07.931
I hate to disappoint you,
George, but she was eyeing me.

53:07.965 --> 53:09.455
( laughing ):
The hell she was!

53:09.500 --> 53:10.990
She was. She was studying me
like a Bible.

53:11.034 --> 53:13.093
Well, you study an encyclopedia
a lot harder

53:13.136 --> 53:14.694
than you study a Bible, Lincoln.

53:14.738 --> 53:16.399
Get all that buckshot
out of your ass yet?

53:16.440 --> 53:18.067
Ten more minutes.

53:18.108 --> 53:19.632
Ten more minutes
is about how long

53:19.676 --> 53:21.303
you got to live,
unless you give up

53:21.345 --> 53:23.074
that bath to the man who
could've killed you

53:23.113 --> 53:24.444
when he met you.

53:24.481 --> 53:26.039
George, you couldn't kill
a bottle of mescal

53:26.083 --> 53:28.210
--with a pack of Mexicans.
--Give up the bath.

53:28.252 --> 53:29.583
What the hell are you doing?

53:29.620 --> 53:31.781
--Get the hell out of here!
--Give up the bath!

53:31.822 --> 53:34.450
Have a seat, sonny.
just stay on your side!

53:43.767 --> 53:44.961
Oh, you had
to see that.

53:45.002 --> 53:46.970
She was eyeing me.

53:47.004 --> 53:49.165
( horse whinnies )

53:52.643 --> 53:54.133
( knock at door )

53:54.177 --> 53:55.838
Come in.

53:57.848 --> 53:59.839
Mr. Dunnison.

54:03.754 --> 54:05.847
( McNelly coughs )

54:10.794 --> 54:13.558
November 17.

54:13.597 --> 54:16.896
The men fought bravely,
but I believe it was my mistake

54:16.934 --> 54:19.425
to lead them into a battle
on such arduous terrain.

54:21.171 --> 54:23.537
With no natural defencements,
they were unprepared

54:23.574 --> 54:25.565
to withstand
such a pitched encounter.

54:25.609 --> 54:28.237
I had believed that the numbers
were in our favor.

54:28.278 --> 54:29.939
I had believed that the raiders

54:29.980 --> 54:31.447
would not be as
well-disciplined

54:31.481 --> 54:33.540
as they were.

54:35.652 --> 54:38.621
It was a disastrous decision.

54:45.629 --> 54:48.029
would you agree with that,
Mr. Dunnison?

54:50.901 --> 54:52.960
Dunnison:
It's awfully
kind of you, Miss

54:53.003 --> 54:55.096
to be taking care of
such wrecks like us.

54:55.138 --> 54:56.366
Awfully kind.

54:56.406 --> 54:58.237
Well, it must've been hard.

54:58.275 --> 55:00.641
Were many young like you?

55:00.677 --> 55:02.872
Rest assured, Miss,
we didn't go down
without a fight.

55:02.913 --> 55:04.938
I killed two raiders
myself at close range.

55:04.982 --> 55:07.177
I may have killed a couple
more in the charge.

55:09.353 --> 55:10.786
What were their names?

55:10.821 --> 55:12.584
Pardon?

55:12.623 --> 55:14.352
you had warrants for them,
I trust.

55:14.391 --> 55:16.359
Well, the raiders opened
fire on us, Miss.

55:16.393 --> 55:18.452
There wasn't time to
consult the warrants.

55:18.495 --> 55:19.860
Well, it's just as well.

55:19.896 --> 55:21.659
you know a man's name,
makes it harder

55:21.698 --> 55:22.790
to kill him,
now, doesn't it?

55:22.833 --> 55:24.460
They're outlaws, Miss.

55:24.501 --> 55:26.059
We're Rangers.

55:26.103 --> 55:28.298
When you kill a man
for stealing some cattle

55:28.338 --> 55:31.034
you are saying that his life
is worth as much as that steer.

55:31.074 --> 55:33.565
Leaves you a whole state
full of men thinking that way

55:33.610 --> 55:35.441
and treating other men
the same.

55:35.479 --> 55:39.074
We ride to protect
the state of Texas.

55:39.116 --> 55:41.311
you ride to balance
the blood on the scales.

55:41.351 --> 55:44.377
but some of you--

55:44.421 --> 55:46.412
like your friend--

55:46.456 --> 55:48.822
I look into his eyes,
and I can see it clear.

55:48.859 --> 55:50.121
He's no killer.

55:50.160 --> 55:52.993
George? you looked in his eyes?

55:54.398 --> 55:56.628
( chuckling ):
George?!

55:59.603 --> 56:01.662
Durham:
Miss.

56:01.705 --> 56:03.263
Ladies.

56:03.306 --> 56:04.500
Hey.

56:04.541 --> 56:05.769
you talking to her?

56:05.809 --> 56:08.642
I got nowhere,
George.

56:08.679 --> 56:10.112
Gunslingers.

56:10.147 --> 56:12.342
She likes
gunslingers.

56:20.524 --> 56:23.960
( horses neighing )

56:23.994 --> 56:26.121
Sergeant, what's going on?

56:26.163 --> 56:28.859
Training exercises,
it looks like.

56:28.899 --> 56:30.298
Who organized this?

56:30.333 --> 56:31.630
Philadelphia did.

56:31.668 --> 56:32.930
about damn time.

56:34.738 --> 56:36.330
Peppercorn.

56:42.112 --> 56:44.580
State'll pay you $40 a mouth.

56:44.614 --> 56:46.479
Four men to a dab.

56:46.516 --> 56:48.245
Seven dabs to a company.

56:48.285 --> 56:50.344
you get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.

56:51.822 --> 56:53.619
you get your orders from me.

56:53.657 --> 56:54.521
Fire!

57:06.303 --> 57:08.100
( whooping )

57:20.417 --> 57:23.250
( indistinct conversation )

57:36.733 --> 57:39.258
Senorita.

57:42.873 --> 57:44.864
Si.

57:47.477 --> 57:49.672
La Senora wanted you
to have these.

57:49.713 --> 57:51.237
They're yours to keep.

57:51.281 --> 57:54.250
you're safe now.

57:54.284 --> 57:56.149
you're with the Rangers.

57:56.186 --> 57:57.915
Those devils
can't hurt you anymore.

57:57.954 --> 57:59.717
Who say they cannot hurt me
no more?

57:59.756 --> 58:02.224
John Armstrong says.

58:07.697 --> 58:09.255
Senora is...

58:09.299 --> 58:11.199
very kind.

58:15.205 --> 58:16.536
( sniffing )

58:19.409 --> 58:21.138
Who were those men?

58:21.178 --> 58:23.908
Name to me
the devils that hurt you.

58:25.782 --> 58:28.649
We're after those men.

58:30.253 --> 58:32.721
I heard them say they were going
to Amargosa

58:32.756 --> 58:36.248
to do a raid at
the Logan ranch.

58:42.833 --> 58:43.891
( kissing softly )

58:46.636 --> 58:48.797
Thank you.

58:54.344 --> 58:56.369
ARMSTRONG:
Come on, recruits,
let's get ready to move out!

58:56.413 --> 58:58.711
Come on, pack it up!

58:58.748 --> 59:01.808
Let's get ready
to move out, boys.

59:03.486 --> 59:05.386
Let's pack her up!

59:08.859 --> 59:10.827
Saying good-bye?

59:13.496 --> 59:14.963
We, uh...

59:14.998 --> 59:17.899
shot five bandits
over at Palo Alto.

59:17.934 --> 59:20.732
Well, I mean...

59:20.770 --> 59:22.397
I killed.

59:22.439 --> 59:23.667
Judy didn't.

59:25.008 --> 59:27.841
but I was
riding Judy.

59:27.878 --> 59:30.472
Hell, they was dead before they
even saw me draw. Blam, blam!

59:30.513 --> 59:33.641
George, sell it
in the dime stores.

59:38.755 --> 59:42.782
She'd... make
a good ranch horse.

59:42.826 --> 59:46.557
I think you'd make
a good ranch hand.

59:49.532 --> 59:51.159
Dunnison:
Miss Dnkes

59:51.201 --> 59:53.135
hope he hasn't tired you
with all his stories:

59:53.169 --> 59:55.660
all the bad men he's killed,
the hangings, the shoot-outs.

59:55.705 --> 59:57.536
It's so hard
to keep track.

59:57.574 --> 59:59.667
Actually, we were speaking
of a horse.

59:59.709 --> 01:00:02.371
He killed a horse?

01:00:02.412 --> 01:00:03.538
( horse burrs )

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.013
Miss Dukes.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.013
McNELLY:
Amargosa's a
40-mile ride

01:00:12.055 --> 01:00:14.046
but we'll make it
by nightfall.

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:15.318
Send a man
into Shepardton.

01:00:15.358 --> 01:00:16.791
Get a telegram
to Victor Logan.

01:00:16.826 --> 01:00:18.691
Tell him to get his
family out of there.

01:00:18.728 --> 01:00:20.025
And the Rangers are coming.

01:00:20.063 --> 01:00:22.463
( horse neighs )

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:29.838
I made the lady a
promise, Captain.

01:00:29.873 --> 01:00:32.808
We're taking her
to Carmargo.

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.642
Hyah.

01:00:54.097 --> 01:00:56.224
( cattle lowing )

01:01:02.772 --> 01:01:04.933
( lowing in distance )

01:01:23.159 --> 01:01:24.956
Another hour

01:01:24.995 --> 01:01:26.860
and it's sunup.

01:01:26.896 --> 01:01:29.763
Any sign over there?

01:01:29.799 --> 01:01:31.824
Dust, Captain.

01:01:31.868 --> 01:01:34.132
Dust and sky.

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:36.468
Night... why
wouldn't they

01:01:36.506 --> 01:01:37.768
raid at night?

01:01:45.448 --> 01:01:47.109
She wasn't dead.

01:01:49.486 --> 01:01:50.680
I don't follow.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.654
The rest were dead.

01:01:52.689 --> 01:01:54.987
And she wasn't.

01:01:55.025 --> 01:01:56.458
So why'd they leave her behind?

01:01:59.362 --> 01:02:01.330
Hey, Captain!

01:02:01.364 --> 01:02:03.457
Captain, wait up!

01:02:04.968 --> 01:02:05.992
( gasps )

01:02:06.036 --> 01:02:07.003
They let you live! Why?

01:02:07.037 --> 01:02:08.595
To say what? What?!

01:02:08.638 --> 01:02:10.230
--Stop! you're scaring her!
--Amargosa?

01:02:10.273 --> 01:02:11.501
Le diije qne no se!

01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:13.566
Captain, she told you
what she heard them say!

01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:15.874
What they wanted her
to hear!

01:02:15.912 --> 01:02:19.040
What they wanted her to say!

01:02:20.717 --> 01:02:23.845
Rangers!

01:02:23.887 --> 01:02:26.822
( sobbing )

01:02:28.691 --> 01:02:30.318
Men, we are riding back
to Dukes.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.759
Dunnison, Donavan, Scipio

01:02:31.795 --> 01:02:33.660
stay behind
with Sergeant Armstrong.

01:02:33.696 --> 01:02:35.721
Take Perdita
as our prisoner.

01:02:35.765 --> 01:02:37.596
Yeah, but what if
they still raid?

01:02:37.634 --> 01:02:39.124
We're not at the raid,
goddamn it!

01:02:39.169 --> 01:02:41.194
The raid can only be
at the Dukes Ranch!

01:02:41.237 --> 01:02:43.228
Hyah. Hyah!

01:02:43.273 --> 01:02:46.003
( horse whinnying )

01:02:59.856 --> 01:03:01.881
( creaking in wind )

01:03:01.925 --> 01:03:03.984
( horse neighs in distance )

01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:08.491
( gunfire, galloping hooves )

01:03:08.531 --> 01:03:10.328
( men shouting )

01:03:10.366 --> 01:03:11.856
( gunfire coutinues )

01:03:14.204 --> 01:03:17.367
Perdita.

01:03:17.407 --> 01:03:18.806
you didn't know.

01:03:18.842 --> 01:03:21.037
you conldn't have.

01:03:24.047 --> 01:03:26.880
Please forgive me.

01:03:27.884 --> 01:03:29.476
( groans )

01:03:31.154 --> 01:03:33.281
( grunting )

01:03:40.563 --> 01:03:43.088
Hyah! Hyah!

01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:44.623
Andale, mas rapido!

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:46.532
Ho! Ho!

01:03:48.471 --> 01:03:50.701
Rapido, ho!

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.264
( groaning )

01:03:52.308 --> 01:03:53.935
Duncan!

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.211
Scipio!

01:04:06.256 --> 01:04:08.053
Hyah!

01:04:08.091 --> 01:04:09.319
Hyah! Hyah!

01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:11.224
( horse neighs )

01:04:11.261 --> 01:04:14.458
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:04:14.497 --> 01:04:16.260
Yo, andale.

01:04:18.835 --> 01:04:21.167
Yo, andale.

01:04:22.605 --> 01:04:23.629
1Andale!

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:26.266
1Arriba, arriba!

01:04:28.178 --> 01:04:30.237
1Andale!

01:04:32.115 --> 01:04:33.582
Hyah! Hyah!

01:04:33.616 --> 01:04:34.878
Hyah!

01:04:34.918 --> 01:04:36.510
Hyah!

01:04:36.553 --> 01:04:37.383
( horse whinnies )

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.978
( grunts )

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.955
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:04:43.993 --> 01:04:45.426
( whimpers )

01:04:45.461 --> 01:04:46.792
Kill me, teijano.

01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:48.990
you want to kill me,
kill me!

01:04:49.032 --> 01:04:50.727
--Or do you want
to have me first?
--I don't want

01:04:50.767 --> 01:04:52.928
to kill you and I don't want to
hurt you-- I want to know why.

01:04:52.969 --> 01:04:55.563
They know I'm from Carmargo.
They are riding to Los Cuevas.

01:04:55.605 --> 01:04:58.073
They say if I don't say
Amargosa, they kill mi familia.

01:04:58.107 --> 01:04:59.836
Tonight?
They ride tonight?

01:04:59.876 --> 01:05:02.037
I say Amargosa for
mi padre, mi madre...

01:05:02.078 --> 01:05:03.511
( hoofbeats )
--Where are they?

01:05:03.546 --> 01:05:04.535
They're riding
for Mexico

01:05:04.581 --> 01:05:06.071
crossing at Los Cuevas.

01:05:06.115 --> 01:05:07.480
Tell George
to get word

01:05:07.517 --> 01:05:08.506
to the company.

01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:09.779
We're taking to the trail.

01:05:09.819 --> 01:05:10.513
Who taking the trail??

01:05:10.553 --> 01:05:11.986
you and I-- Mexico.

01:05:23.499 --> 01:05:24.796
Richard!

01:05:24.834 --> 01:05:26.267
( horse neighs )

01:05:26.302 --> 01:05:28.600
Richard!

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.645
( hammers cocking )

01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:41.775
( sighs )

01:05:41.818 --> 01:05:43.547
Where's Richard?

01:06:03.706 --> 01:06:05.731
( cattle lowing )

01:06:05.775 --> 01:06:08.539
( men whistling )

01:06:13.016 --> 01:06:14.745
Rangers!

01:06:18.454 --> 01:06:19.648
Drive the herd!

01:06:26.496 --> 01:06:28.487
These are Mexican beeves now!

01:06:28.531 --> 01:06:29.657
And the man is

01:06:29.699 --> 01:06:32.497
a Mexican man.

01:06:42.011 --> 01:06:44.172
( hooves thundering )

01:07:08.705 --> 01:07:10.866
Captain Leander McNelly.

01:07:11.908 --> 01:07:13.739
I've been waiting for you.

01:07:13.776 --> 01:07:15.607
The young
soldier there

01:07:15.645 --> 01:07:17.545
has been talking my
ear off since dawn

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.640
trying to work
himself a trade.

01:07:20.683 --> 01:07:22.583
One Mexican juggler

01:07:22.618 --> 01:07:24.279
for one Texas clown.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:27.084
you send Captain Dukes
across that river

01:07:27.123 --> 01:07:29.489
we'll send your girl.

01:07:29.525 --> 01:07:30.958
you have my word.

01:07:30.993 --> 01:07:32.688
I could use a man
like you, Captain--

01:07:32.729 --> 01:07:36.460
a man who can shoot,
a man of his word.

01:07:36.499 --> 01:07:40.060
Man could live like a king
in Mexico.

01:07:40.103 --> 01:07:42.094
If I was your wife
and boys

01:07:42.138 --> 01:07:44.868
Mexico's where I would have
hightailed it by now

01:07:44.907 --> 01:07:48.206
instead of waiting
for a killer like you.

01:07:48.244 --> 01:07:51.304
Maybe they're here now,
McNelly...

01:07:51.347 --> 01:07:54.475
living like kings in Mexico.

01:07:54.517 --> 01:07:57.452
Captain Dukes for the girl.

01:07:57.487 --> 01:08:00.320
He means nothing to you.

01:08:00.356 --> 01:08:02.085
Ah, but he means something
to you.

01:08:09.065 --> 01:08:11.158
Richard!

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.259
Now we send her!

01:08:13.302 --> 01:08:15.793
--No!
--Stand down, Mr. Dunnison.

01:08:15.838 --> 01:08:18.102
Dunnison:
What she did was
to save her family.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:19.768
She's a victim, not an outlaw.

01:08:19.809 --> 01:08:22.038
Stand down...

01:08:22.078 --> 01:08:23.978
or be shot.

01:08:24.013 --> 01:08:26.345
This is not
what Rangers do.

01:08:26.381 --> 01:08:28.372
Captain, show them

01:08:28.417 --> 01:08:31.353
the difference between them
and us.

01:08:35.957 --> 01:08:38.551
Stand down, Dunnison.

01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:03.848
The state of Texas commands you

01:09:03.886 --> 01:09:07.049
to leave its lands
now and forever.

01:09:07.089 --> 01:09:10.252
you will be prosecuted
and imprisoned

01:09:10.292 --> 01:09:12.557
should you
ever return.

01:09:12.595 --> 01:09:14.495
( gun uncocking )

01:09:19.535 --> 01:09:22.868
May God have mercy on your sonl.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.459
PERDITA:
I did what you say!

01:09:53.502 --> 01:09:56.028
Yeah, and you'll do what I say
tonight, and you'll do

01:09:56.072 --> 01:09:57.300
what I say tomorrow.

01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.467
Maybe one day
we'll charge admission.

01:09:59.509 --> 01:10:01.067
( whips knife )

01:10:01.344 --> 01:10:03.904
( guitar musicplaying )

01:10:07.783 --> 01:10:09.546
( cattle lowing )

01:10:20.563 --> 01:10:23.293
Don't know which
I want to do worse:

01:10:23.332 --> 01:10:26.426
kill the son of
a bitch up there...

01:10:26.469 --> 01:10:29.905
or go teach him
how to play.

01:10:29.939 --> 01:10:32.737
McNELLY:
Take up your pen, Mr. Dunnison.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:35.736
No notebook, sir?

01:10:35.778 --> 01:10:37.609
Take up your pen.

01:10:40.616 --> 01:10:44.108
November 19.

01:10:44.153 --> 01:10:48.021
I, Leander McNelly,
being of sound mind

01:10:48.057 --> 01:10:50.548
do hereby bequeath
my land and property

01:10:50.593 --> 01:10:54.723
to the Texas Rangers

01:10:54.764 --> 01:10:56.994
to do as
they see fit.

01:10:57.033 --> 01:10:59.501
The following
items excepted:

01:10:59.535 --> 01:11:02.095
my Navy Colts,
field glasses

01:11:02.138 --> 01:11:07.041
and books
on military strategy...

01:11:07.076 --> 01:11:08.873
to Lincoln Rogers Dunnison--

01:11:11.247 --> 01:11:15.183
a soldier fit to lead.

01:11:15.217 --> 01:11:19.347
My Bible I would like
to be buried with.

01:11:19.388 --> 01:11:21.288
That is all.

01:11:24.527 --> 01:11:26.620
( writing )

01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:28.493
( pen clinks into inkwell )

01:11:28.531 --> 01:11:29.930
Sir...

01:11:29.966 --> 01:11:33.333
In that fort will be
far more than 30 men.

01:11:33.369 --> 01:11:35.667
They'll never expect us
to cross

01:11:35.705 --> 01:11:37.332
into Mexico.

01:11:37.373 --> 01:11:40.570
They'll be well-armed
and well-provisioned.

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:42.237
They've been riding
for weeks, sir.

01:11:42.278 --> 01:11:43.643
It's their first night back.

01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:46.307
The women, the liquor...
they'll crave sleep.

01:11:55.391 --> 01:11:56.756
( McNelly coughing )

01:11:58.027 --> 01:12:00.552
( retching )

01:12:03.165 --> 01:12:05.929
Bones, start your men
at the front gates.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.069
Baker.

01:12:19.115 --> 01:12:20.377
Yes, sir.

01:12:20.416 --> 01:12:21.906
Take you men high
to the ridge.

01:12:21.951 --> 01:12:22.975
Come on.

01:12:36.766 --> 01:12:39.394
( water splashing )

01:12:46.575 --> 01:12:49.135
( yells )

01:12:55.851 --> 01:12:59.651
Armstrong, Durham, take your men
low to the back gates.

01:12:59.689 --> 01:13:01.281
Dunnison and I

01:13:01.323 --> 01:13:02.620
will take the front.

01:13:02.658 --> 01:13:04.421
Now let's wake them np.

01:13:05.828 --> 01:13:08.422
( all yelling )

01:13:15.538 --> 01:13:18.632
Caballeros, the tunnels!
Come on!

01:13:18.674 --> 01:13:20.266
Let's get in the tunnels!
Move!

01:13:23.312 --> 01:13:26.475
Rangers!

01:13:40.062 --> 01:13:42.087
( screaming )

01:13:49.472 --> 01:13:51.440
Vamonos, apurate!

01:13:55.511 --> 01:13:57.001
Charge!

01:13:57.046 --> 01:13:59.674
( whooping and cheering )

01:14:01.150 --> 01:14:03.118
We're in, Rangers!

01:14:03.152 --> 01:14:04.380
Oh, shit!

01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:06.810
We're surronnded!

01:14:06.856 --> 01:14:09.154
What the hell?? !

01:14:09.191 --> 01:14:11.091
( screams )

01:14:15.865 --> 01:14:17.526
We're surronnded in the back!

01:14:34.683 --> 01:14:35.980
( grunting )

01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:56.538
( McNelly cocking gun )

01:15:15.591 --> 01:15:17.650
( yelling )

01:15:20.863 --> 01:15:22.626
( gun hammer clicks )

01:15:29.638 --> 01:15:31.071
I'm out of cartridges!

01:15:31.106 --> 01:15:33.040
Someone throw me
a cartridge!

01:15:33.075 --> 01:15:34.906
( gunshots in distance )

01:15:36.478 --> 01:15:38.912
( hammer clicks twice )

01:15:38.948 --> 01:15:40.813
( grunts )

01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:42.943
( grunts )

01:15:49.592 --> 01:15:51.492
Vamos, rapido!

01:15:53.762 --> 01:15:56.663
Heard you were fast.

01:15:58.133 --> 01:15:59.327
( yells )

01:15:59.368 --> 01:16:01.529
Faster than that.

01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:02.628
( grunts )

01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:14.612
( grunts )

01:16:16.085 --> 01:16:17.882
( gun hammer cocks )

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.979
This is only
gonna hurt

01:16:20.022 --> 01:16:21.455
for a second.

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:23.720
Maybe two.

01:16:25.394 --> 01:16:27.385
( cocks hammer )

01:16:27.429 --> 01:16:30.296
Kill him, Mr. Dunnison.

01:16:30.332 --> 01:16:32.357
Kill him.

01:16:32.401 --> 01:16:34.028
you kill me,
I'll kill him.

01:16:47.116 --> 01:16:50.176
( gunshots )

01:16:51.487 --> 01:16:52.977
( cocks gun )

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:01.525
( gunshots )

01:17:01.563 --> 01:17:04.293
( gunshots )

01:17:08.671 --> 01:17:10.764
( grnnts )

01:17:34.396 --> 01:17:36.956
Go!

01:17:45.107 --> 01:17:47.166
Captain!

01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:49.074
Captain, they want
to surrender.

01:17:49.111 --> 01:17:50.476
They want to surrender.

01:17:50.512 --> 01:17:52.173
No surrender,
right, Captain?

01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:54.011
No prisoners, right?

01:17:54.049 --> 01:17:56.279
We take back our cattle.

01:17:56.318 --> 01:17:58.752
We take them as prisoners.

01:17:58.787 --> 01:18:00.812
We take them to trial.

01:18:00.856 --> 01:18:01.914
but, Captain...

01:18:01.957 --> 01:18:04.517
Those are the terms.

01:18:07.997 --> 01:18:10.727
( cattle mooing )

01:18:13.235 --> 01:18:15.226
( Rangers whistling )

01:18:24.513 --> 01:18:26.606
( cattle lowing in distance )

01:18:31.387 --> 01:18:33.480
( McNelly coughing inside )

01:18:40.329 --> 01:18:41.660
He wants to see you boys.

01:18:51.273 --> 01:18:54.504
( coughing )

01:19:11.994 --> 01:19:14.792
When they remember us,
Rangers...

01:19:18.167 --> 01:19:22.331
let them remember us not
as men of vengeance...

01:19:22.371 --> 01:19:25.033
( coughing )

01:19:28.844 --> 01:19:32.575
but... as men of law...

01:19:32.614 --> 01:19:36.414
and justice.

01:20:09.651 --> 01:20:11.551
( approaching footsteps )

01:20:14.857 --> 01:20:16.791
( sighing )

01:20:20.195 --> 01:20:23.858
Can't help but think
that they're watching.

01:20:23.899 --> 01:20:27.892
Yeah...
I bet they're up there

01:20:27.936 --> 01:20:32.396
riding like
the old days.

01:20:32.441 --> 01:20:34.739
( horse whinnying )

01:20:34.776 --> 01:20:36.266
Hey, Caroline!

01:20:36.311 --> 01:20:37.539
( laughing )

01:20:37.579 --> 01:20:38.944
Rounding up cattle.

01:20:38.981 --> 01:20:40.642
We'll see you tonight!

01:20:40.682 --> 01:20:44.243
He'll make
a good rancher.

01:20:44.286 --> 01:20:46.186
And whatever else
you've got in mind

01:20:46.221 --> 01:20:48.121
he might be all right
at that, too.

01:20:50.692 --> 01:20:52.751
He's a good man, Mr. Dunnison.

01:20:57.065 --> 01:20:59.533
Ride safe, Mr. Dunnison.

01:21:06.475 --> 01:21:08.534
Rangers...

01:21:12.548 --> 01:21:13.981
Ride out!

01:21:17.052 --> 01:21:19.987
( horses whinnying )

01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:37.304
( hooves pounding )

01:21:38.305 --> 01:21:44.419
