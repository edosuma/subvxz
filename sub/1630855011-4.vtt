00:15.174 --> 00:16.611
to make a man like you
my guardian?

00:16.611 --> 00:18.146

And Mr. Drummle, of course,
America is no longer a colony.

We crossed paths in
The Phoenix last night.

05:05.053 --> 05:07.057
He is seeking insurance
for a cargo of furs.

His ship is in from Montreal
and docked at Wapping.

05:12.635 --> 05:14.873

the landlord of The Phoenix.

05:15.374 --> 05:18.012
He previously listened in
on conversations for me.

05:18.948 --> 05:21.486
He said Dorget booked
a private meeting room

05:21.486 --> 05:24.358
to meet with a Jamaican planter
called Thompson.

05:27.431 --> 05:30.370
You are a very,
very enterprising boy,

06:27.719 --> 06:29.823

a fine English accent, so...

See if you can find some actress
who works at Drury Lane

06:31.860 --> 06:32.929
who performs Shakespeare.

06:33.498 --> 06:35.668
She can perform Lady Macbeth

17:08.032 --> 17:10.303
The chaperone who was going
to sit in with Drummle

17:10.303 --> 17:12.507
and his future wife has
complained of a stomach upset.

17:13.041 --> 17:14.646
They need someone to be
in the room with them

17:14.646 --> 17:16.448
as they have
their inaugural conversation.

17:17.050 --> 17:19.053
A requirement dictated
by etiquette.

17:21.224 --> 17:22.393
Why are you telling me?

17:24.164 --> 17:27.169
Because I need you to be at
the exchange at precisely 1:30

17:27.904 --> 17:31.646
where you will sit, in silence,
in the office,

17:31.646 --> 17:33.449
in between Drummle
and Estella Havisham

17:33.449 --> 17:35.185
as they meet
for the very first time,

17:35.720 --> 17:37.892
and engage in
what I'm sure will be

17:37.892 --> 17:41.364
half an hour of sparkling
and coquettish conversation.

17:44.404 --> 17:46.709
You've told Drummle
that I will be his chaperone?

17:56.896 --> 18:00.537
You do these things purely
for your own fucking amusement.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.208
Move!

18:03.543 --> 18:05.279
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

18:22.413 --> 18:23.448
Shit.

18:27.891 --> 18:29.495
JAGGERS: The thing is, Pip,

18:29.796 --> 18:32.166
if you really want
to win Estella,

18:32.701 --> 18:34.370
you will need more than love.

18:35.974 --> 18:37.678
You will also need hate.

18:41.552 --> 18:43.623
When Dorget's ship
leaves Hispaniola

18:43.623 --> 18:44.825
with its human cargo,

18:45.192 --> 18:47.831
it will be breaking
British maritime law

18:48.332 --> 18:50.837
forbidding the transportation
of slaves.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.844
But it is we
who are insuring the ship.

18:53.844 --> 18:56.315
And it is I who has
already sent a message

18:56.315 --> 18:58.653
to the Royal Navy blockade
outside Hispaniola,

18:59.087 --> 19:01.525
ensuring that Dorget's ship
will be seized.

19:02.728 --> 19:04.464
Dorget will be hanged
as a slaver.

19:04.899 --> 19:06.001
He will hang?

19:06.001 --> 19:08.673
A just reward for his
evil trading, don't you think?

19:09.474 --> 19:10.543
And what of us?

19:11.546 --> 19:12.715
We are liable as accomplices...

19:12.715 --> 19:16.388
No, it will be Drummle who
will be the legal accomplice.

19:18.860 --> 19:20.497
We will ensure
that only Drummle signs

19:20.497 --> 19:21.932
the insurance papers
for the ship.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.539
And if it can be proven
that Drummle was aware

19:24.539 --> 19:26.576
of the nature of the cargo
when he insured it,

19:26.576 --> 19:27.911
he will be tried for complicity.

19:29.548 --> 19:30.583
How can it be proven?

19:30.583 --> 19:32.954
You and I together
will give evidence against him.

19:34.625 --> 19:36.596
At the very least,
his assets will be taken,

19:36.596 --> 19:39.333
and we will lay claim to them
by way of unpaid debts.

19:43.776 --> 19:45.613
And the slaves aboard the ship
will be freed.

19:47.851 --> 19:49.622
That is the other consequence
of your plan.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.257
Of no consequence to me.

19:54.264 --> 19:57.504
You've alerted the Royal Navy to
such ships before, Mr. Jaggers.

19:58.606 --> 20:00.610
If there was a profit in it.

20:00.911 --> 20:03.649
How many times, Mr. Jaggers?

20:08.626 --> 20:09.828
Pip Gargery...

20:11.464 --> 20:13.269
To be complicit
in such a strategy

20:13.269 --> 20:14.337
where a man will hang,

20:14.337 --> 20:15.540
and another will be ruined,

20:16.274 --> 20:17.945
you will need to
not only love Estella,

20:17.945 --> 20:20.015
you will also need
to hate Drummle.

20:22.688 --> 20:25.026
And I am sure that after
listening to Drummle

20:25.026 --> 20:26.496
talking spite and drivel

20:26.496 --> 20:29.367
to the woman you love
for half an hour,

20:29.367 --> 20:32.239
I have no doubt you will have
enough hate in your heart

20:32.841 --> 20:35.948
to make you come on board
with the wicked plans

20:35.948 --> 20:38.351
of the evil Mr. Jaggers.

20:43.462 --> 20:44.932
Learn never to be drunk,

20:45.834 --> 20:47.336
but never to be sober.

20:54.484 --> 20:56.889
Get to Drummle's now
or you'll be late.

21:19.735 --> 21:22.373
- DRUMMLE: Punctual as ever.
- (DOOR CLOSING)

21:22.373 --> 21:25.613
I imagine the lady will exercise
her prerogative and be late.

21:31.626 --> 21:32.594
How do I look?

21:35.099 --> 21:36.301
You look fine.

21:37.704 --> 21:38.706
DRUMMLE: Fine?

21:40.710 --> 21:41.712
Commanding.

21:42.146 --> 21:43.348
Good. Thank you.

21:44.685 --> 21:46.487
As... As with a horse,

21:47.624 --> 21:49.561
one must take
command immediately.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.105
I have had my hair cut.

21:58.613 --> 21:59.648
It's...

22:00.583 --> 22:01.585
Shorter.

22:03.121 --> 22:04.825
It is in the style
of Lord Melbourne.

22:07.129 --> 22:08.499
Yes.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.970
You look very much like
a prime minister.

22:12.908 --> 22:14.043
What do you smell in the air?

22:16.716 --> 22:17.717
Tobacco.

22:20.155 --> 22:21.457
Nutmeg.

22:22.026 --> 22:24.063
I want her to know me
with every sense.

22:25.934 --> 22:28.539
(SOFTLY) Except for touch,
of course. (SNIFFING)

22:28.973 --> 22:29.975
Of course.

22:33.516 --> 22:34.651
Where do you want me to sit?

22:38.058 --> 22:39.494
Umm...

22:40.997 --> 22:42.366
(MUFFLED) You sit here.

22:46.609 --> 22:49.782
Oh, and please understand that
according to convention,

22:49.782 --> 22:51.953
a chaperone,
no matter what happens,

22:51.953 --> 22:53.823
does not say a fucking word.

22:56.696 --> 22:57.697
Understood.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.010
DRUMMLE: Take command, Drummle.

23:04.545 --> 23:06.815
Take command. Take command.

23:08.218 --> 23:09.655
(CLEARING THROAT)

23:11.625 --> 23:13.461
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

23:23.616 --> 23:25.152
(HORSE WHINNIES)

23:33.201 --> 23:34.604
This way, Miss Estella.

23:41.552 --> 23:42.721
(EXHALING)

23:50.002 --> 23:51.739
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

23:51.940 --> 23:52.941
MAN: Madam.

24:09.575 --> 24:10.576
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

24:11.712 --> 24:12.714
DRUMMLE: Come.

24:15.285 --> 24:18.158
BUTLER: Miss Estella Havisham,
Mr. Bentley Drummle.

24:20.062 --> 24:21.766
Yes, yes, I know it is
the normal convention

24:21.766 --> 24:23.001
that the chaperone
should be a woman.

24:23.001 --> 24:24.604
We were let down
in the last moment.

24:25.707 --> 24:27.042
My servant here is just a boy.

24:28.713 --> 24:30.482
You can plainly see
he's not a man.

24:31.719 --> 24:33.789
So I hope we may proceed?

24:43.074 --> 24:44.545
I believe it was agreed we have

24:44.545 --> 24:46.148
a half hour in each
other's company.

24:46.148 --> 24:48.218
It is now almost quarter two.

24:48.218 --> 24:50.222
We should talk
until 13 minutes past.

24:50.557 --> 24:53.228
How was your journey from... Um...

24:55.165 --> 24:57.169
My journey was fine, thank you.

24:58.806 --> 25:00.275
- You live by the river?
- Yes.

25:00.543 --> 25:02.146
Where the river is very wide.

25:03.181 --> 25:04.217
ESTELLA: And where the fog

25:04.217 --> 25:05.954
makes everything
terribly mysterious.

25:05.954 --> 25:06.989
Mmm-hmm.

25:07.624 --> 25:09.862
My ships pass down the river.

25:09.862 --> 25:11.198
Maybe you've seen them.

25:11.198 --> 25:12.232
They are very large ships.

25:12.534 --> 25:13.803
I have no view of the river.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.307
Though I understand

25:16.307 --> 25:18.813
some in the village spend
all their waking hours

25:18.813 --> 25:20.282
staring at the passing ships.

25:20.650 --> 25:21.886
DRUMMLE: Hmm. Hmm.

25:21.886 --> 25:23.221
Mine are very distinctive.

25:24.157 --> 25:25.927
They have sails beetroot red.

25:26.962 --> 25:29.835
Large, huge sails.

25:30.336 --> 25:33.242
And they sail to the East
to collect nutmeg.

25:33.242 --> 25:34.611
I'm allergic to nutmeg.

25:35.078 --> 25:36.114
Good.

25:38.953 --> 25:39.989
Do you...

25:39.989 --> 25:41.024
Do you like to walk?

25:41.024 --> 25:43.796
If I have somewhere
to walk to, I walk there.

25:44.263 --> 25:45.366
I walk to think.

25:45.366 --> 25:46.602
And what do you think?

25:47.236 --> 25:48.673
DRUMMLE: That depends
on many things.

25:48.673 --> 25:52.747
Mostly, I think about
business, money,

25:52.948 --> 25:55.887
- big ships and...
- And nutmeg?

25:56.154 --> 25:57.156
(SNICKERING)

26:08.111 --> 26:09.815
My great uncle knew
your grandfather.

26:10.216 --> 26:12.252
It seems everyone
is connected to everyone else.

26:13.689 --> 26:14.791
(DRUMMLE CLEARS THROAT)

26:15.359 --> 26:16.796
Do you ride horses?

26:16.796 --> 26:17.831
No.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.935
I hunt. Foxes.

26:20.302 --> 26:21.639
I feed foxes.

26:21.639 --> 26:22.941
I feed foxes to my dogs.

26:22.941 --> 26:24.109
Oh, how opposite we are.

26:24.611 --> 26:25.813
(SHOUTING) Look at me!

26:30.155 --> 26:31.825
What I mean is,
don't keep looking at him.

26:32.192 --> 26:33.161
Look at me.

26:36.367 --> 26:38.238
You say so soon
we are opposites.

26:40.108 --> 26:42.981
In minute two
of our acquaintance,

26:42.981 --> 26:44.383
you say we are opposites.

26:45.954 --> 26:47.256
Well, let me be clear
from the start.

26:47.256 --> 26:49.194
It has already been agreed
we are to be married.

26:49.194 --> 26:52.734
And there is no room for
opposites in a marriage,

26:53.035 --> 26:55.807
there is only room
for one outlook.

26:55.807 --> 26:58.812
And that will be my outlook.

27:01.217 --> 27:02.419
There can be debate,

27:03.488 --> 27:04.992
and discourse,

27:04.992 --> 27:07.196
but it should be
merry and light.

27:08.398 --> 27:09.400
Do you understand?

27:11.304 --> 27:12.306
Do you understand?

27:14.210 --> 27:19.220
In matters of importance,
debate would be pointless.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.034
The wife of a Drummle

27:26.034 --> 27:29.006
will become a Drummle
in more than just name.

27:30.977 --> 27:31.979
Are you all right?

27:33.281 --> 27:35.252
Something in this room
is making my eyes sting.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.323
Nutmeg perhaps.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.426
It doesn't speak.

27:43.903 --> 27:44.938
May I please have
a handkerchief?

27:45.807 --> 27:46.808
DRUMMLE: No, no!

27:54.891 --> 27:55.893
Very well.

28:05.445 --> 28:07.249
As I was saying, where you are
not prepared to act

28:07.249 --> 28:10.422
and indeed think like a Drummle,
there will be reprimand.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.796
And beyond reprimand,
should the need arise,

28:13.796 --> 28:16.434
at the end of
the spectrum in our discourse,

28:16.434 --> 28:18.973
there will be this...

28:20.777 --> 28:23.348
It is a man's right to prevail.

28:24.350 --> 28:28.258
If the stick is of a thickness
to meet the approval of law.

28:33.502 --> 28:35.072
Of course, that would be
a last resort,

28:35.072 --> 28:37.476
but I thought
you should really know

28:37.476 --> 28:39.280
at the very beginning
how things will proceed,

28:39.280 --> 28:42.085
how things will become,
how things are, and will be.

28:43.121 --> 28:44.356
Might be...

28:45.860 --> 28:47.062
Hopefully will never be.

28:49.467 --> 28:51.470
And I thought
you would appreciate it

28:52.039 --> 28:54.545
if I impressed upon you
at the outset

28:54.545 --> 28:57.483
in the first three minutes
of our relationship...

28:57.483 --> 28:59.821
Has it only been three minutes?

29:00.122 --> 29:01.123
(TICKING)

29:02.426 --> 29:04.063
...That I am in command.

29:08.271 --> 29:09.406
So...

29:11.010 --> 29:14.918
With the serious business
of who's in command settled,

29:14.918 --> 29:17.122
more pleasant topics.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.195
What are the things
you really love,

29:20.195 --> 29:21.932
and what are the things
you really hate?

29:21.932 --> 29:25.138
For example, I hate cats.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.908
I hate nutmeg

29:34.256 --> 29:36.093
ESTELLA: Is this fate
or strategy?

29:36.327 --> 29:39.167
PIP: Neither. It is something
far more powerful than fate.

29:39.167 --> 29:40.836
His name is Mr. Jaggers.

29:41.470 --> 29:42.541
Estella, I have to talk to you.

29:42.541 --> 29:43.910
I have an appointment
to be fitted

29:43.910 --> 29:45.412
for my wedding dress
in 30 minutes.

29:45.412 --> 29:47.850
You cannot even think about
marrying that fucking idiot!

29:48.886 --> 29:51.424
I see London hasn't
improved your vocabulary.

29:53.395 --> 29:54.998
But it has improved
my position in the world.

29:56.134 --> 29:57.102
I have to go, Pip.

30:05.953 --> 30:08.124
You smell of burnt leather
and something worse.

30:11.464 --> 30:13.301
Estella, there are many things
I can't tell you.

30:13.301 --> 30:15.271
You make your living
as a chaperone.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.042
No...

30:18.478 --> 30:19.581
It's part of a plan.

30:22.486 --> 30:24.090
But for now,
all you need to know

30:24.090 --> 30:25.560
is you must not marry him.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.129
You know I have no choice.

30:27.698 --> 30:29.300
The plan was conceived
by Mr. Jaggers,

30:29.300 --> 30:30.368
so it is a good one.

30:30.368 --> 30:32.874
Since when did my mother's
lawyer do anything good?

30:34.210 --> 30:36.882
What I mean is
the plan is very bad.

30:37.650 --> 30:39.153
But it gives us hope.

30:40.923 --> 30:41.758
Which is good.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.030
Miss Havisham
has made it very clear

30:44.030 --> 30:46.601
if I refuse to marry him,
she will disinherit me.

30:51.512 --> 30:52.914
And I will take care of you.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.155
You?

31:00.630 --> 31:02.065
You?

31:02.567 --> 31:05.305
She'd hand me over
to a blacksmith's boy?

31:08.211 --> 31:10.448
A blacksmith's boy
who will be rich.

31:11.150 --> 31:12.319
"Will be rich."

31:13.355 --> 31:16.561
Right, because you have a plan,
you and Mr. Jaggers?

31:17.396 --> 31:19.501
Estella, these days
I am an underwriter.

will take us to Cairo.
