WEBVTT

00:08.750 --> 00:09.710
D-oh!

00:09.790 --> 00:10.660
( screams )

00:23.850 --> 00:25.450
Did you hear
about Miss Hoover?

00:25.520 --> 00:27.860
She drank a bottle
of drain cleaner by mistake.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.780
I heard she fell down
a well.

00:29.860 --> 00:30.930
Ahhhhh!

00:30.990 --> 00:31.850
( <i>sobbing )</i>

00:31.930 --> 00:33.160
Come on, now.

00:33.230 --> 00:35.470
My God,
she's been dumped again.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.140
Children,
I won't be staying long.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.100
I just came from the doctor

00:39.170 --> 00:40.470
and I have lyme disease.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.570
Principal Skinner
will run the class

00:42.640 --> 00:44.280
until a substitute arrives.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.140
What's lyme disease?

00:45.210 --> 00:46.480
I'll field that one.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.910
Lyme disease is spread
by small parasites

00:48.980 --> 00:49.650
called ticks.

00:49.710 --> 00:51.280
When a diseased tick

00:51.350 --> 00:53.820
attaches itself to you
and begins sucking your blood
Ohhh..

00:53.880 --> 00:55.440
malignant spirochetes
infest your bloodstream

00:55.520 --> 00:58.390
eventually spreading to your
spinal fluid and on into the
brain.

00:58.450 --> 00:59.850
The brain--
oh, dear God.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.330
( <i>class chatters )</i>

01:01.390 --> 01:01.860
Come on, Elizabeth.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.250
Come, come.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.960
( <i>sheepishly )
Well now, children, here we are.</i>

01:06.030 --> 01:08.700
Open your primers to page 32.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.130
Ah, subtraction.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.440
( <i>screaming from above )</i>

01:12.370 --> 01:13.840
Bart Simpson!

01:13.900 --> 01:15.230
I know it's you.

01:16.270 --> 01:17.880
Here comes snowball two.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.310
This is the one we kept.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.250
Kids:
Eww!

01:21.310 --> 01:23.050
We were gonna keep the gray one,
but the mother ate her.

01:23.110 --> 01:24.220
Kids:
Eww!

01:24.280 --> 01:25.620
Mrs. Krabappel

01:25.680 --> 01:27.490
he's traumatizing
the children.

01:27.550 --> 01:28.890
As usual,
I agree with you, Martin.

01:28.950 --> 01:30.920
Bart, shut that off
and take your seat immediately.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.490
Oh look, this is really cool.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.880
When you hit reverse,
I can make 'em go back in.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.390
( <i>screaming )</i>

01:40.400 --> 01:42.830
No, children,
you're not seeing things.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.370
This, my little friends,
is a schwa.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.930
( <i>cap guns firing )</i>

01:49.610 --> 01:51.280
Are you the substitute?

01:51.340 --> 01:52.340
Yes, sir.

01:52.410 --> 01:54.210
Yes, I am.
Are you insane?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.450
No sir, no I'm not.
It's my way of getting
their attention.

01:56.510 --> 01:57.450
Well, all right.

01:57.510 --> 01:58.840
Play friendly

01:58.910 --> 02:00.440
with your
new teacher, children.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.650
Howdy.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.120
I am a Texas cowboy.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.760
The year is 1830.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.590
You young'uns ask me
any questions you like.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.430
Can we play kickball
instead of science after lunch?

02:09.490 --> 02:12.200
Kickball? Son, there ain't
no kickball in 1830.

02:12.260 --> 02:13.630
Any other questions?

02:13.700 --> 02:16.030
Shoot, it's awfully quiet
on the plains here.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.970
How about this?

02:18.030 --> 02:21.560
Everybody? I want to see
two eyes on every person
staring right at me.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.440
There are three things wrong
with my costume.

02:24.510 --> 02:27.750
Anybody names those three things
will get my hat.

02:27.810 --> 02:29.410
I believe I know the answer.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.180
What's your name?

02:31.250 --> 02:32.080
Lisa Simpson.

02:32.150 --> 02:33.280
Go ahead.

02:33.350 --> 02:35.790
1: Your belt buckle says
"State of Texas"

02:35.850 --> 02:38.690
but Texas wasn't a state
until 1845.

02:38.750 --> 02:39.580
Very good.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.930
2: The revolver

02:40.990 --> 02:42.860
wasn't invented
until 1835.

02:42.930 --> 02:43.960
Excellent.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.660
3: You seem to be
of the Jewish faith.

02:45.730 --> 02:46.600
Are you sure I'm Jewish?

02:46.660 --> 02:47.870
- Or Italian.
- I'm Jewish.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.670
And there weren't any
Jewish cowboys.

02:49.730 --> 02:51.240
Very good. Excellent.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.240
I'm also wearing
a digital watch

02:53.300 --> 02:54.610
but I'll accept that. Here you
go, little lady.

02:54.670 --> 02:57.080
And there <i>were
a few Jewish cowboys--</i>

02:57.140 --> 02:59.010
big guys who
were great shots

02:59.070 --> 03:00.470
and spent money freely.

03:00.540 --> 03:01.900
I'm Mr. Bergstrom.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.750
Feel free to make fun of my name
if you want.

03:03.810 --> 03:06.170
two suggestions
are "Mr. Nerdstrom"

03:06.250 --> 03:08.290
and "Mr. Booger-strom."

03:09.520 --> 03:10.820
Boys and girls

03:10.890 --> 03:13.560
today we will begin selecting
a class president.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.420
I'm not allowed to vote

03:15.490 --> 03:17.530
but I strongly suggest
you elect Martin. Martin?

03:17.590 --> 03:19.490
As your president

03:19.560 --> 03:22.630
I would demand
a science fiction library

03:22.700 --> 03:26.640
featuring an A-B-C
of the overlords of the genre:

03:26.700 --> 03:29.270
Asimov, Bester, Clarke...

03:29.340 --> 03:30.240
What about
Ray Bradbury?

03:30.310 --> 03:31.810
I'm aware of his work.

03:31.870 --> 03:36.340
Thank you, and...
keep watching the skies!

03:36.410 --> 03:37.280
Excellent!

03:37.350 --> 03:38.050
Excellent

03:38.110 --> 03:39.370
Martin.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.920
If you're through
with your pemmican

03:41.980 --> 03:44.410
why don't we sing a song
about cowboys?

03:44.490 --> 03:46.420
This one's not very accurate

03:46.490 --> 03:48.430
but we can fix it up
as we go along. Okay?

03:48.490 --> 03:52.400
♪ Home, home on the range... ♪

03:52.460 --> 03:54.900
Actually, the range
was far from home.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.520
( quietly )
It was a very desolate place

03:56.600 --> 03:59.740
where danger and disease
rode tall in the saddle.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.180
♪ Where the deer
and the antelope play... ♪

04:04.240 --> 04:06.040
( whispering )
but unlike the
efficient Indians,

04:06.110 --> 04:08.410
cowboys used only the tongue
of the antelope

04:08.480 --> 04:10.210
and they threw the rest away.

04:10.280 --> 04:16.450
♪ Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word ♪

04:16.519 --> 04:22.330
♪ And the skies are
not cloudy all day. ♪

04:22.390 --> 04:23.830
Hey, what's this?

04:23.890 --> 04:25.190
Did you do it?

04:25.260 --> 04:26.700
No, it wasn't me.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.700
I would <i>never do
anything like that.</i>

04:28.760 --> 04:31.130
It was just one of those
immature people who, instead
of building themselves up--

04:31.200 --> 04:32.640
It's neat.
Can I have it?

04:32.700 --> 04:33.910
Yes, but I didn't do it.

04:33.970 --> 04:35.470
Are you sure you didn't?
It's good.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.980
No, but I'm starting
to wish I had.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.710
Ladies and gentlemen:
The Singing Dork.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.280
( <i>whispering: )
Lisa.</i>

04:42.340 --> 04:45.410
( <i>snickering )</i>

04:45.480 --> 04:46.780
Any other nominations?

04:46.850 --> 04:48.450
Both:
We nominate Bart Simpson.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.590
Speech!
Speech!

04:49.650 --> 04:52.620
I had a speech ready,
but my dog ate it.

04:52.690 --> 04:53.420
( <i>kids laughing )</i>

04:53.490 --> 04:55.330
Children!

04:55.390 --> 04:57.330
Bart, I need someone
very reliable

04:57.390 --> 04:59.920
to deliver an important message
to the principal's office.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.130
Would you do it for me?

05:02.200 --> 05:05.070
Why Mrs. Krabappel,
How would <i>I know where
the principal's office is?</i>

05:05.130 --> 05:05.960
( <i>laughing )</i>

05:06.030 --> 05:07.730
( <i>clapping and cheering )</i>

05:07.800 --> 05:11.470
People, what have I told you
about encouraging him?

05:11.540 --> 05:14.410
When Bart wins approval
for making a fool of himself
it makes him think that--

05:14.480 --> 05:15.550
Yay, Bart!

05:15.610 --> 05:17.180
( <i>hysterical laughing )</i>

05:17.250 --> 05:19.380
( <i>chanting: )
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!</i>

05:19.450 --> 05:22.120

No one was with her

05:38.430 --> 05:42.260

05:42.340 --> 05:44.040
Come on, Janey

05:44.110 --> 05:45.440
everybody has a talent.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.110
I want to see yours.
That's all.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.580
I don't have a talent.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.670
You can not talk like that.
There has to be something

05:50.750 --> 05:53.280
that you do better
than anybody else.

05:53.350 --> 05:54.550
Well, I can do this.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.410
Yes! Great.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.420
How about you, Ralph?

05:59.690 --> 06:00.690
Wonderful!

06:00.760 --> 06:01.690
Chuck.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.660
Oh, that's disgusting.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.000
I love it.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.830
Lisa! Come on,
you're holding out on us.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.300
I see a saxophone over there.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.430
I can't.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.170
Come on, Lisa.
I bet you're good.

06:12.230 --> 06:13.530
No, really, I can't.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.810
Sure, you can.
Just try.

06:14.870 --> 06:16.510
Please don't make me do it.

06:16.570 --> 06:18.310
All right, you owe me
something special.

06:18.370 --> 06:19.900
( <i>bell ringing )</i>

06:19.980 --> 06:21.250
( <i>laughing and chattering )</i>

06:23.550 --> 06:24.980
So...

06:25.050 --> 06:26.820
while I'm technically
still married

06:26.880 --> 06:29.250
there really hasn't been
any marriage to speak of

06:29.320 --> 06:32.690
since <i>Mister Krabappel
moved into his little love nest.</i>

06:32.750 --> 06:35.550
This profession can put
a lot of strain
on a marriage.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.020
Since he's been gone

06:37.090 --> 06:39.430
I've been looking
for a substitute

06:39.490 --> 06:41.720
to teach me a lesson
I <i>sorely need.</i>

06:41.800 --> 06:44.340
Mrs. Krabappel,
you're trying to seduce me.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.500
Well?

06:46.570 --> 06:47.970
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Krabappel.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.080
You're very nice, but..
it's the children I love.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.340
( <i>sighing )</i>

06:52.410 --> 06:53.910
Oh...

06:56.680 --> 06:59.850
( <i>saxophone playing the blues)</i>

07:16.570 --> 07:17.700
When I fall asleep,

07:17.770 --> 07:18.870
Mr. Bergstrom is the
last thing I think of.

07:18.930 --> 07:20.760
and he's my first thought
when I wake up.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.570
I feel that way
about your father.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.180
No, no. You don't understand.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.250
When Mr. Bergstrom smiles,
you only see these teeth

07:28.310 --> 07:30.050
but when you really
make him laugh

07:30.110 --> 07:32.950
you can see these two teeth.
I think they're called the
'eye teeth'?

07:33.020 --> 07:37.020
I don't know if he had
orthodontic work or what,
but they're absolutely perfect.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.190
I notice little things
about your father too.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.250
No, Mom. This is different.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.520
This man makes you feel
like there's nobody better.

07:43.590 --> 07:44.960
Your father does that to me.

07:45.030 --> 07:48.370
Mom, are we going to talk,
or are we going to talk?

07:48.430 --> 07:51.140
Lisa, we can talk,
but first you have to
accept the fact

07:51.200 --> 07:51.900
that I feel that way
about your father.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.440
Fine.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.770
Yesterday he read us
<i>Charlotte's Web</i>

07:55.840 --> 07:59.110
and cried at the end,
never trying to hide his tears.

07:59.170 --> 08:02.070
( <i>laughing )
( <i>laughing )</i></i>

08:02.140 --> 08:04.010
A book made him cry?

08:04.080 --> 08:06.750
Boo-ho!
Waaaah!

08:06.820 --> 08:08.120
( <i>groaning )</i>

08:10.090 --> 08:11.820
Mr. Bergstrom:
<i>Remember,
nobody, and I mean nobody</i>

08:11.890 --> 08:15.160
gets back in after lunch
without one igneous rock--

08:15.220 --> 08:16.450
that's volcanic--

08:16.530 --> 08:18.030
and one sedimentary,
and that is layered.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.590
Lisa, can I see you
for a minute?

08:19.660 --> 08:20.360
( to herself )
Yes!

08:20.430 --> 08:21.930
Yes, Mr. Bergstrom?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.370
Lisa, your homework
is always so neat.
How can I put this?

08:24.430 --> 08:26.560
Does your father
help you with it?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.910
No. Homework's
not my father's specialty.

08:28.970 --> 08:30.210
Well, there's no shame in it.
My Dad--.

08:30.270 --> 08:31.080
Not mine.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.010
You didn't let me finish.

08:32.070 --> 08:34.070
Unless the next word was "burp"

08:34.140 --> 08:35.400
You didn't have to.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.320
In a sample taken
in this very classroom

08:38.380 --> 08:41.750
a state inspector found
1.74 parts per million

08:41.820 --> 08:42.990
of asbestos!

08:43.049 --> 08:44.520
That's not
enough.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.320
We demand <i>more asbestos.</i>

08:46.390 --> 08:48.730
More asbestos!
More asbestos!

08:48.790 --> 08:50.630
( <i>kids chanting: )
More asbestos! More asbestos!</i>

08:52.830 --> 08:53.970
Wow!

08:54.030 --> 08:55.730
You made the front page.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.840
Aw dad, it's just a
popularity contest.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.040
<i>Just a popularity contest?</i>

09:00.100 --> 09:03.070
Excuse me, what's more important
than popularity?

09:03.140 --> 09:05.280
Bart, do you really think
you can win?

09:05.340 --> 09:06.780
Sure. Why not?

09:06.840 --> 09:10.010
Whoo hoo! All right.
I always knew you had
personality.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.120
The doctor said
it was hyperactivity

09:11.180 --> 09:12.550
but I knew better.

09:12.610 --> 09:14.340
President Simpson.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.290
Has a nice ring to it,
doesn't it, boy?

09:17.350 --> 09:18.480
Hmm... yeah.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.180
Now, <i>go get 'em!</i>

09:20.260 --> 09:21.960
( <i>growling )</i>

09:22.020 --> 09:24.690
He says there aren't
any easy answers.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.200
I say he's not
looking hard enough!

09:27.260 --> 09:30.970
( <i>kids cheering )</i>

09:31.030 --> 09:33.730
( <i>kids chanting: )
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!</i>

09:40.610 --> 09:41.780
( <i>laughing )</i>

09:41.840 --> 09:43.970
( <i>cheering )</i>

09:44.050 --> 09:47.120
( <i>kids chanting: )
Bart! Bart! Bart! Bart!</i>

09:55.190 --> 09:56.660
( sighs )
Oh, you'll never
go broke

09:56.730 --> 09:58.430
appealing to the lowest
common denominator.

09:58.490 --> 09:59.720
You're gonna miss
your brother's antics.

09:59.790 --> 10:01.120
When?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.630
When?
When your life
takes you places

10:02.700 --> 10:04.340
the rest of us
have only heard about.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.970
Places where my
intelligence will be an asset
and not a liability?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.710
Yes. There is
such a place.

10:08.770 --> 10:09.810
Believe me, it's true.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.580
I believe everything you say

10:11.640 --> 10:13.710
with your words,
your body language

10:13.780 --> 10:15.650
and your Semitic good
looks.

10:15.710 --> 10:18.350
"Dear Miss Hoover,
You have lyme disease.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.710
"We miss you.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.050
"Kevin's biting me.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.250
"Come back soon.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.360
"Here is a drawing
of a spirochete.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.620
Love, Ralph."

10:25.690 --> 10:27.560
Oh, that's great, Ralph.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.380
( <i>bell ringing )
Hey kids!</i>

10:29.460 --> 10:31.930
I've learned that
in two weeks, the Springfield
Museum of Natural History

10:31.990 --> 10:34.960
will be closing forever
due to a lack of interest.

10:35.030 --> 10:36.970
I urge you to see it

10:37.030 --> 10:38.200
<i>while you can.</i>

10:38.270 --> 10:39.370
( <i>slurping )</i>

10:39.430 --> 10:42.530
Lisa needs to go
to the museum tomorrow

10:42.600 --> 10:45.630
and I think
you should take her.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.580
The museum? Tomorrow?

10:47.640 --> 10:52.010
Oh, Marge, I'd love to,
but I was planning on...

10:52.080 --> 10:54.020
<i>Sleeping?
Eating a
big sandwich?</i>

10:54.080 --> 10:56.540
<i>Watching TV?
Spending time with the boy!</i>

10:56.620 --> 10:59.190
Spending time with the boy.
The boy needs attention, Marge.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.920
I've been talking to Lisa,
and I'm concerned about
your relationship with her.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.060
Me, too, Mom.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.490
I think they're
drifting apart.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.460
Shut up, boy.

11:05.530 --> 11:06.530
Homer, please!

11:06.600 --> 11:08.130
Marge, you don't
understand.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.300
I can't do it because...

11:09.360 --> 11:10.790
<i>you're trapped.</i>

11:10.870 --> 11:13.740
<i>If you were smarter,
you might think of something..</i>

11:13.800 --> 11:14.840
<i>But you're not.</i>

11:14.900 --> 11:16.760
All right,
I'll take her.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.110
Lousy brain.

11:19.670 --> 11:23.970
Hey, what do you mean
by "Suggested Donation"?

11:24.050 --> 11:25.820
Pay any amount you wish, sir.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.320
And what if I
wish to pay... zero?

11:28.380 --> 11:30.040
It's up to you.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.020
So it's up to me, is it?

11:32.090 --> 11:32.660
Yes.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.060
I see.

11:34.120 --> 11:37.020
And you think that people
are gonna pay you $4.50

11:37.090 --> 11:39.360
even though
they don't have to

11:39.430 --> 11:42.230
just out of the goodness
of their..?

11:42.300 --> 11:43.270
( <i>laughing )</i>

11:43.330 --> 11:44.500
Well, anything you say.

11:44.570 --> 11:45.700
Good luck, lady.

11:45.770 --> 11:47.300
You're
going to need it.

11:47.370 --> 11:49.040
Mr. Bergstrom!

11:49.100 --> 11:50.460
Hi, Lisa.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.640
Hey! you don't have to pay.
Read the sign.

11:52.710 --> 11:55.180
And this must be
your father.
( sighs )

11:55.240 --> 11:57.740
His teeth had
jagged edges to rip
through your body

11:57.810 --> 11:59.510
but he could've
swallowed you whole.

11:59.580 --> 12:00.890
Wow!

12:00.950 --> 12:02.620
Actually, Mr. Simpson,
they do know

12:02.680 --> 12:05.110
a great deal
about the process of
mummification.

12:05.190 --> 12:07.630
First they pulled the brain out
through the nose
with an iron hook.

12:07.690 --> 12:09.990
then stuffed the insides
with sawdust and onions.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.000
Eww! Gross!

12:11.060 --> 12:12.560
Ooh! Pretty creepy.

12:12.630 --> 12:15.300
Still, I'd rather have him
chasing me than The Wolfman.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.790
Oh Lord.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.310
Mr. Simpson, I am going
to be presumptuous.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.170
I have noticed
that Lisa seems to feel

12:28.240 --> 12:29.670
she has no strong
male role model.

12:29.740 --> 12:30.840
She said that?

12:30.910 --> 12:33.310
No, she didn't say it, but...

12:33.380 --> 12:35.350
But you can tell, right?

12:35.420 --> 12:38.290
She looks around and sees
everybody else's dad
with a good education

12:38.350 --> 12:40.450
<i>youthful looks
and a clean credit record</i>

12:40.520 --> 12:42.730
and thinks,
"Why me? what did I do
to deserve

12:42.790 --> 12:44.030
this fat old piece of..?"

12:44.090 --> 12:45.860
Mr. Simpson, you have got to be
a bigger man.

12:45.930 --> 12:48.670
There is a wonderful girl's
future at stake.

12:48.730 --> 12:50.370
Well, if she's so wonderful,
give her an "A."

12:50.430 --> 12:52.170
I am giving her an "A."

12:52.230 --> 12:55.000
Great, but don't tell her
it was a favor to me.
Tell her she earned it.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.070
Mr. Simpson, she <i>did earn it!</i>

12:56.140 --> 12:57.780
You are smooth..
I'll give you that.

13:03.110 --> 13:07.480
He ruined the one chance
I had of getting to know Mr.
Bergstrom outside of school.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.550
Well, I'll tell you what.

13:09.620 --> 13:12.390
Why don't we invite
Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?

13:12.450 --> 13:14.380
Oh, Mom, that's wonderful!

13:14.460 --> 13:17.030
Can I find out his
favorite dish,
and help you make it?

13:17.090 --> 13:17.760
Sure...
Can I wear
your jewelry?

13:17.830 --> 13:18.860
Sure!

13:18.930 --> 13:20.230
- Can I get my ears pierced?..
- No...

13:20.300 --> 13:22.170
Yes... no...
Dye my shoes?..
Paint my nails?..

13:22.230 --> 13:24.970
Yes... no...
Can we have wine?..
Can <i>I have wine?..</i>

13:25.030 --> 13:25.890
( volume fades )
- Does Bart have to be there?
- Yes.

13:25.970 --> 13:28.110
Can we do it this week?

13:28.170 --> 13:29.870
<i>"Mr. Bergstrom,
May we request the pleasure</i>

13:29.940 --> 13:31.840
of your company..." No.

13:31.910 --> 13:34.880
"If you're not doing anything
this Friday..." No.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.770
"Mr. Bergstrom,
Do you like pork chops?"

13:37.850 --> 13:39.820
Oh, no, of course you wouldn't.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.720
( <i>gasps )</i>

13:42.780 --> 13:44.250
Good morning, Lisa.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.720
I'm back.

13:50.660 --> 13:53.330
You see, class,
my lyme disease
turned out to be..

13:53.400 --> 13:55.030
psy-cho-somatic.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.400
Does that mean
you're crazy?

13:56.460 --> 13:59.160
No, that means
she was faking it.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.530
No, actually, it was
a little of both.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.770
Sometimes, when a disease
is in all the magazines

14:03.840 --> 14:05.010
and on all the news shows,

14:05.070 --> 14:07.770
it's only natural
that you think you have it.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.370
- Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
- I don't know.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.510
Although I'd sure
like to talk to him.

14:11.580 --> 14:14.420
He didn't touch my lesson plan.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.610
What did he teach you?

14:15.680 --> 14:18.080
That life is worth living.
( gasps )

14:19.750 --> 14:22.350
The polls will be open from
now until the end of recess.

14:22.420 --> 14:26.050
Just in case any of you have
decided to put any
thought into this

14:26.130 --> 14:27.360
we'll have our final statements.

14:27.430 --> 14:28.670
Martin?

14:28.730 --> 14:32.470
I don't think there's
anything left to say.

14:32.530 --> 14:33.560
Bart?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.540
Victory party
under the slide!

14:35.600 --> 14:36.900
( <i>cheering )</i>

14:40.140 --> 14:42.450
Mr. Bergstrom!

14:42.510 --> 14:44.750
Mr. Bergstrom!

14:44.810 --> 14:47.110
Hey! He moved out
this morning.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.320
He must have a
new job--

14:48.380 --> 14:49.810
He took his Copernicus costume.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.410
Do you know where
I can find him?

14:51.490 --> 14:54.390
Uh, I think he's taking
the next train to Capital City.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.530
The train-- how like him--

14:56.590 --> 14:59.260
Traditional,
yet environmentally sound.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.670
Yes, and it's been the backbone
of our country

15:01.730 --> 15:03.230
since Leland Stanford

15:03.300 --> 15:06.140
drove that golden spike
at Promontory Point.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.870
I see he touched you too.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.510
( <i>both sigh )</i>

15:09.570 --> 15:11.240
Thanks
for your vote, man.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.840
I didn't vote.
Voting's for geeks.

15:12.910 --> 15:14.950
Well, you got that right.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.580
Thanks for
your vote, girls.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.410
We forgot.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.520
Well, don't sweat it.
Just so long as a couple
of people did

15:20.580 --> 15:21.420
Right, Milhouse?

15:21.480 --> 15:22.480
Uh-uh.

15:22.550 --> 15:23.450
- Lewis?
- No.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.790
Somebody must have voted.

15:24.850 --> 15:26.010
What about you?

15:26.090 --> 15:27.120
Didn't you vote?

15:27.190 --> 15:28.490
Uh-oh.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.690
( <i>school bell )</i>

15:29.760 --> 15:31.060
( <i>screaming )</i>

15:31.130 --> 15:34.570
( <i>cheering )</i>

15:34.630 --> 15:37.030
I demand a recount.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.070
One for Martin...
Two for Martin.

15:39.130 --> 15:40.360
Would you like
another recount?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.440
No.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.660
Well I just
wanna make sure.

15:43.740 --> 15:45.240
One for Martin...
Two for Martin.
( chuckles )

15:46.910 --> 15:47.850
This way, Mr. President.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.590
Announcer:
Now boarding on track five...

15:54.650 --> 15:56.690
Mr. Bergstrom!

15:56.750 --> 15:58.320
Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!

15:58.390 --> 15:59.590
Hey!

15:59.650 --> 16:00.810
Lisa!

16:00.890 --> 16:02.460
Hey, Lisa, indeed.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.150
What?

16:03.220 --> 16:04.590
What is it?

16:04.660 --> 16:06.230
Oh, I mean...

16:06.290 --> 16:09.820
Were you just going to leave,
just like that?

16:09.900 --> 16:11.570
Aw, I'm sorry, Lisa.

16:11.630 --> 16:14.500
It's the life of
the substitute teacher.

16:14.570 --> 16:16.240
He's a fraud.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.170
Today he might be
wearing gym shorts

16:18.240 --> 16:20.080
tomorrow he's
speaking French

16:20.140 --> 16:24.180
or pretending to know
how to run a band saw,
or God knows what.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.420
You can't go.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.480
You're the best teacher
I'll ever have.

16:27.550 --> 16:29.850
Aw, that's not true.
Other teachers
will come along.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.090
Oh, please!

16:31.150 --> 16:33.250
No, I can't lie to you,
I am the best

16:33.320 --> 16:35.960
but they need me
over in the projects
of Capital City.

16:36.020 --> 16:38.420
( nearly whispering )
But... I need you too.

16:38.490 --> 16:41.390
That's the problem
with being middle class.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.020
Anybody who really cares
will abandon you

16:44.100 --> 16:45.970
for those
who need it more.

16:46.030 --> 16:48.430
I-I understand.

16:48.500 --> 16:52.630
Mr. Bergstrom,
I'm going to miss you.

16:52.710 --> 16:55.680
I'll tell you what.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.370
Whenever you feel
like you're alone

16:58.450 --> 17:00.480
and there's nobody
you can rely on

17:00.550 --> 17:03.550
this is all you need to know.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.490
Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.

17:05.550 --> 17:06.950
All aboard!

17:07.020 --> 17:09.160
So, I guess
this is it.

17:09.220 --> 17:11.319
If you don't mind

17:11.390 --> 17:14.220
I'll just run
alongside the train

17:14.300 --> 17:16.599
as it speeds you
from my life.

17:28.910 --> 17:30.310
Good-bye,
Lisa honey.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.820
It will be okay.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.820
Just read the note!

17:41.320 --> 17:43.520
Homer:
Bart didn't get one vote?!

17:43.590 --> 17:47.060
Oh, this is the worst thing
that could ever happen to us.

17:47.130 --> 17:50.970
All right--
spilt milk, spilt milk.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.340
What are you
so mopey about?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.340
Nothing.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.040
Lisa, tell your father.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.800
Mr. Bergstrom
left today.

17:56.870 --> 17:57.810
Oh?

17:57.870 --> 17:59.300
He's gone forever.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.430
And?

18:00.510 --> 18:02.450
I didn't think you'd understand.

18:02.510 --> 18:07.220
Hey! Just because I don't care
doesn't mean I don't understand.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.950
I'm glad I'm not crying,
because I

18:10.020 --> 18:11.660
would hate for you to think

18:11.720 --> 18:12.960
<i>that what I'm about to say</i>

18:13.020 --> 18:15.260
<i>is based on emotion.</i>

18:15.320 --> 18:17.580
But you, sir...

18:17.660 --> 18:18.830
are a baboon!

18:18.890 --> 18:20.320
Me?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.070
Yes, you!

18:22.130 --> 18:23.530
Baboon! Baboon! Baboon!

18:23.600 --> 18:26.170
I don't think you realize
what you're saying.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.330
<i>( screaming )
Baboon!!</i>

18:28.400 --> 18:29.760
( <i>crying )</i>

18:29.840 --> 18:31.070
Whoa...

18:31.140 --> 18:33.080
Somebody was bound
to say it one day.

18:33.140 --> 18:34.380
I just can't believe
it was her.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.510
Did you hear that, Marge?
She called me a baboon--

18:37.580 --> 18:40.850
The stupidest, ugliest,
smelliest ape of them all.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.020
You're not allowed to have
hurt feelings right now.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.260
There's a little girl upstairs
who needs you.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.560
Her confidence
in her father
is shaken

18:48.620 --> 18:50.820
and no little girl can be happy
unless she has faith

18:50.890 --> 18:53.100
in her daddy.

18:53.160 --> 18:53.900
( <i>groans )</i>

18:57.170 --> 18:59.840
( <i>reading: )
"Go away."</i>

18:59.900 --> 19:01.310
( <i>sobbing )</i>

19:01.370 --> 19:04.140
Lisa, don't hold
anything back.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.880
You can tell me.

19:05.940 --> 19:09.750
Are you crying because
you called Daddy a baboon?

19:09.810 --> 19:10.580
No!

19:10.650 --> 19:11.450
Nuts.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.250
D-ohhh!

19:13.310 --> 19:16.480
This isn't
going well at all.

19:16.550 --> 19:18.890
Look, if you just want me
to forgive you...

19:18.950 --> 19:21.150
I just wish
I knew what to say.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.580
( <i>melancholy music playing )</i>

19:23.660 --> 19:26.260
Although,
maybe this music will help.

19:26.330 --> 19:29.800
Now, you lost someone special
and it hurts.

19:29.860 --> 19:33.290
I'm lucky, because I never lost
anyone special to me.

19:33.370 --> 19:36.510
Everyone special to me
is under this roof.

19:36.570 --> 19:38.280
It's true.

19:38.340 --> 19:42.250
You'll have lots of special
people in your life, Lisa.

19:42.310 --> 19:45.520
There's probably someplace
where they all get together

19:45.580 --> 19:48.990
and the food is real good
and guys like me
are serving drinks.

19:49.050 --> 19:53.390
Oh, well, maybe
I can't explain all this

19:53.450 --> 19:55.450
but I can fix
your dollhouse for you.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.890
At least I'm good
at... monkey work.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.600
You know? Monkey?

20:00.660 --> 20:02.030
You know
what I mean?

20:02.100 --> 20:03.630
Yeah.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.800
Bet I can hold
these nails in place
with my tail.

20:06.870 --> 20:08.440
( <i>imitating monkey )</i>

20:08.500 --> 20:11.200
( <i>laughing )</i>

20:11.270 --> 20:12.530
You're so silly.

20:12.610 --> 20:14.040
Give me a banana.

20:14.110 --> 20:16.010
I don't have any bananas.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.880
Come on, you're
holding out on me.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.750
( <i>both laughing )</i>

20:23.080 --> 20:24.850
I'm sorry I called you
a baboon, Dad.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.220
Think nothing of it.

20:27.620 --> 20:30.390
President prince,
president princess

20:30.460 --> 20:32.030
president priss...

20:33.730 --> 20:36.130
Hey, what's the matter, son?

20:36.200 --> 20:37.800
Aw, Dad...

20:37.870 --> 20:41.000
If just me, Milhouse
and Louis had voted.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.870
Hey, son

20:42.940 --> 20:46.040
would you have gotten any money
for being class president?

20:46.110 --> 20:47.110
No.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.280
Would you have to
do extra work?

20:48.340 --> 20:49.800
Yeah.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.920
And, is this Martin guy
going to get to do
anything neat,

20:52.980 --> 20:55.190
like throw out the first ball
at the World Series?

20:55.250 --> 20:56.450
Well, no.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.190
So let the baby
have his bottle, huh?

20:59.250 --> 21:00.580
That's my motto.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.230
( <i>both laughing )</i>

21:03.290 --> 21:05.560
Hey, thanks, monkey man.

21:07.160 --> 21:11.130
Holy moly,
talk about parenting.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.540
( <i>fussing )</i>

21:13.600 --> 21:15.070
Uh-oh.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.580
Sleep well, Maggie.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.240
Three for three.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.410
Homey, did you straighten
everything out?

21:24.480 --> 21:25.980
Ah, bup, bup, bup, bup!

21:26.050 --> 21:27.980
Don't say anything,
Marge.

21:28.050 --> 21:30.020
Let's just go to bed.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.750
I'm on the biggest roll
of my life.
