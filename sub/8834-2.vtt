Oh, dig it! Yeah!

02:31.625 --> 02:35.667
Whoa, if we don't get to Louie's,
this place is gonna be shut down.

02:35.750 --> 02:40.875
Relax, kid.
The bank wouldn't send anyone this early.

02:41.792 --> 02:44.000
-[scoffs] You hope.
-[knocking on door]

02:49.709 --> 02:52.667

-Good morning. I'm--
-We're closed, lady.

02:55.250 --> 02:59.583
Come back when the sun's warm, like June.
Bye-bye.

03:07.458 --> 03:11.083
[groans] If this is how
you treat customers, buster,

03:11.166 --> 03:13.375
it's no wonder this business is failing.

03:13.458 --> 03:17.667
[laughs] Back off, lady.
You act like you own this place.

03:18.792 --> 03:20.917
-I do.
-What?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.667
When you didn't pay
your loan this morning,

03:23.750 --> 03:25.750
the bank sold the deed to me.

03:27.709 --> 03:28.583
Told ya.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.041
Well, they didn't give me time
to brush my teeth.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.917
You must be Baloo.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.750
-The bank says you're a terrific pilot.
-Well, that's true.

03:40.834 --> 03:46.166
I'd be inclined to add sloppy,
careless, and rude.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.625
Wha... An-- And just who are you, sister?

03:49.709 --> 03:52.709
Rebecca Cunningham, business major.

03:52.792 --> 03:56.208
I've been looking for a failing company
like this for some time.

03:56.291 --> 03:57.667
[shudders]

03:57.750 --> 04:00.333
And, now that I've sunk
my life savings into it,

04:00.417 --> 04:03.667
I'm going to turn this place
into a real money-maker.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.959
Yes, this definitely needs
a woman's touch.

04:07.041 --> 04:10.208
-Now, listen you--
-Sounds terrific, lady.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.959
-I'll bet you do just great here.
-Why, thank you.

04:14.041 --> 04:15.417
Kit!

04:15.500 --> 04:18.000
Forget her, Baloo. Remember the treasure.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.125
Hey, yeah, yeah.

04:22.917 --> 04:26.125
Well, enjoy yourself, Ms. Manager.

04:26.208 --> 04:29.959
-Kit and me are off to Louie's place.
-Not in my plane, you aren't.

04:30.041 --> 04:34.500
Now, just a prop-spinning minute.
The <i>Sea Duck </i> is mine.

04:34.583 --> 04:38.750
-Not according to the bank.
-Oh, that's it.

04:38.834 --> 04:43.333
Mommy, do I still have to wait in the car?

04:43.792 --> 04:47.834
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Come see our new place.

04:47.917 --> 04:49.834
Uh, this is my daughter, Molly.

04:49.917 --> 04:52.250
We'll be staying here
until I find an apartment.

04:52.333 --> 04:57.667
-Hm, swell.
-Wow! Can I keep my room this messy?

04:59.375 --> 05:04.041
Now let's be reasonable, lady.
That plane is my baby.

05:04.125 --> 05:07.500
Fine, $50,000 and she's yours.

05:07.583 --> 05:10.750
In the meantime,
I have an opening for a staff pilot.

05:10.834 --> 05:14.208
Hey, if you think
I'm flying for you, brown eyes,

05:14.291 --> 05:15.959
you got your hair tied too tight.

05:16.041 --> 05:18.166
Louie's! Louie's!

05:18.250 --> 05:20.792
Huh? Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

05:20.875 --> 05:25.208
Come to think of it,
I'd love to be your pilot, Becky.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.625
Good. And it's Rebecca, not Becky.

05:27.709 --> 05:30.542
Now, who else do we have on staff?

05:30.625 --> 05:34.875
Uh, Kit Cloudkicker, ma'am.
I'm the navigator.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.709
Hey, can I be the tail-gunner?

05:37.792 --> 05:39.750
[makes machine gun sound]

05:39.834 --> 05:42.583
[Rebecca] No, honey. You're too young.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.375
Oh!

05:44.959 --> 05:49.834
I bet being a pilot
is the funnest thing in the whole world.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.583
Used to be.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.667
Gosh, suddenly, I've got an office,

05:54.750 --> 05:58.291
a plane, and two of my very own employees.

06:00.583 --> 06:04.583
Hey, Baloo, I finally fixed
that sewer pipe. You want the old one?

06:04.667 --> 06:09.458
Make that three. Our mechanic, Wildcat.

06:09.542 --> 06:14.792
Wildcat, meet Rebecca Cunningham,
our new boss.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.542
Really?
Well, you smell pretty good for a boss.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.000
[scoffs] Thanks.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.792
This poor little guy was all clogged up.

06:25.875 --> 06:30.709
He was saying, "Help me, help me.
I can't breathe. I got a cold."

06:31.291 --> 06:35.041
This is a mechanic? He couldn't tell
a screwdriver from a bus driver.

06:35.125 --> 06:38.375
Oh, yeah? Watch.

06:44.333 --> 06:50.250
Oh, Wildcat, I think there's
something wrong with the phone.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.583
Yeah, you could be right.

06:52.667 --> 06:55.250
You ought to be more careful.

06:55.333 --> 06:58.125
Three... two... one.

06:58.208 --> 06:59.583
[ringing]

06:59.667 --> 07:02.291
-It's for you.
-You were saying?

07:02.375 --> 07:05.959
Well, at least something
works around here.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.917
[horns honking]

07:26.417 --> 07:29.333
Uh, Mr. Khan! Mr. Khan!

07:31.667 --> 07:33.792

07:38.333 --> 07:39.625
Speak.

07:40.792 --> 07:44.166
[stammering] I-- I-- I have an update
on the stone, sir.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.750
It's been found?

07:45.834 --> 07:49.667
Uh... n-- not exactly, sir,

07:49.750 --> 07:51.875
but you'll be happy to know,

07:51.959 --> 07:56.417
-we located our pilot, safe and--
-[Mr. Khan] Where is the stone?

07:56.500 --> 07:57.458
[gulps]

07:58.500 --> 08:02.750
-It's been... [stutters] stolen.
-By whom?

08:02.834 --> 08:05.750
Air... [stutters] pirates.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.458
[Mr. Khan sighs]

08:07.959 --> 08:11.125
I've spent years building Khan Industries

08:11.208 --> 08:14.542
into the biggest corporation in the world.

08:14.625 --> 08:19.250
And I've discovered that business
is like a jungle.

08:19.333 --> 08:23.083
-You see, there are the eaters...
-[gasps]

08:23.166 --> 08:26.417
And there are the eatens.

08:27.125 --> 08:30.375
Find those pirates.

08:30.458 --> 08:31.375
[gulps]

08:31.458 --> 08:34.041
[stuttering] Yes, sir.

08:34.125 --> 08:38.750
[laughing] <i>Bon appétit.</i>

08:48.291 --> 08:50.875
Look, Mommy! I'm done.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.000
Fabulous!

08:54.083 --> 08:56.500
Get out here, Baloo. Let me take a look.

08:56.583 --> 09:00.375
[Baloo] Forget it, lady,
I'm not going out in public like this.

09:00.458 --> 09:04.709
If you ever want to fly the <i>Sea Duck </i> again
you get out here on the double.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.291
All right, all right.

09:07.792 --> 09:10.625
I feel like a flying fool.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.542
What? What did you do to my plane?

09:15.417 --> 09:16.709
[Rebecca] Isn't it wonderful?

09:16.792 --> 09:20.709
And, incidentally, you look terrific.
From now on, you're gonna get noticed.

09:21.667 --> 09:24.625
Oh, I'm telling you,
no one's going to hire a pilot

09:24.709 --> 09:26.792
dressed like a flying soda jerk.

09:26.875 --> 09:28.583
Oh, no?

09:28.667 --> 09:34.208
What if I told you I just landed us
the sizable Fandango Mango account?

09:34.291 --> 09:36.834
You're pulling my propeller.

09:37.750 --> 09:42.667
-Is this Higher for Hire?
-Why, yes, I'm the owner, Rebecca--

09:42.750 --> 09:44.625
Mangoes. Which plane, ma'am?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.041
The pretty one.

09:46.125 --> 09:49.417
W-- W-- what happened
to Baloo's Air Service?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.875
Higher for Hire is cuter.

09:51.959 --> 09:55.709
All right, I made the deal.
Now, you deliver the goods.

09:55.792 --> 10:00.083
Can I go, too, Mommy? Please, oh, please,
please, please, please.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.917
-Sorry, sweetie.
-But I promised Lucy.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.625
Oh, Lucy looks scared right now.

10:06.709 --> 10:09.875
But maybe she'll be ready
to fly next time.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.500
OK, Kit!

10:13.333 --> 10:14.375
Thanks.

10:30.667 --> 10:34.291
Boy, we sure put one over
on that old Becky. [laughs]

10:34.375 --> 10:38.041
Aw, she's not so bad. I kinda like her.

10:38.166 --> 10:44.166
Well, maybe she knows business,
but she's got a lot to learn about planes.

10:44.583 --> 10:50.375
[yawns] Take the stick, little britches,
while I climb out of this monkey suit.

10:50.458 --> 10:51.792
Roger, skipper.

10:51.875 --> 10:54.583
[Don Karnage] Attention, my noble pilots.

10:54.667 --> 11:00.000
This is Don Karnage here,
speaking to you in my voice.

11:00.083 --> 11:01.417
Keep your eyes peeled, men.

11:01.500 --> 11:05.625
That plane with the box
is bound to come out later or sooner.

11:05.709 --> 11:06.917
[grunts]

11:08.083 --> 11:10.709
They shall not pass!

11:12.667 --> 11:16.500
[Baloo laughs]
Wouldn't old Beckers pop her pearls

11:16.583 --> 11:19.250
if she knew we was going to Louie's?

11:19.333 --> 11:20.959
Yeah, but how's she ever gonna know?

11:21.041 --> 11:23.542
[Molly] What's so great about Louie's?

11:23.625 --> 11:24.583
[both] Molly!

11:24.667 --> 11:27.792
Lucy's not scared no more.

11:32.333 --> 11:36.250
-How'd you get here, button nose?
-I hid in the mangoes.

11:36.333 --> 11:40.542
Oh, great.
You shouldn't have come, little lady.

11:40.625 --> 11:43.250
Now I got to take you back.

11:43.333 --> 11:47.000
Oh, please, take me with you.
I'll be real good.

11:47.083 --> 11:50.875
Sorry, but you're taking
a one-way trip home.

11:50.959 --> 11:53.250
Well, OK.

11:54.291 --> 11:59.458
Mommy probably didn't want me
to go Louie's anyway.

11:59.542 --> 12:00.667
Louie's?

12:00.750 --> 12:04.417
Uh, now, you don't have to
tell your mom about Louie's.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.834
Oh, I won't, if you take me along.

12:07.917 --> 12:11.375
Why, you sneaky... [laughs]

12:11.458 --> 12:15.125
You know something, pigtails?
You think like me.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.625
I guess we're going to Louie's.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.208
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

12:20.291 --> 12:25.125
Captain Cunningham, to navigator,
watch out for pirates.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.125
[making airplane sounds]

12:33.500 --> 12:38.834
I thought Molly might like one of your
world-famous Krakatoa Specials.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.125
Oh, what's that?

12:41.208 --> 12:45.625
Why, just the most de-bob-i-licious
sundae you ever tasted.

12:45.709 --> 12:48.333
[scatting]

12:51.709 --> 12:55.917
-Pal, where's that old treasure?
-Follow me.

12:58.542 --> 13:02.583
Ooh, I feel a fortune coming on.

13:02.667 --> 13:06.917
-Ta-da!
-Well, pop my peepers.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.917
Ohh, sorry, Lucy, but there's not
enough here for both of us.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.834
Psst, Louie.

13:18.458 --> 13:23.166
Could you give us a bead on this bauble,
like, what's it worth?

13:23.959 --> 13:26.291
[exclaiming]

13:27.959 --> 13:29.166
Yowsa!

13:29.250 --> 13:31.583
Yeah, yeah. How much is yowsa?

13:31.667 --> 13:33.000
Yeah, in round numbers.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.291
Nothing, cuz. It's not a jewel.

13:35.375 --> 13:38.625
-Nothing?
-Nada. Zero. Zip, zilch.

13:38.709 --> 13:42.583
-It's man-made, man.
-Aw, nuts!

13:48.834 --> 13:51.166
Ooh, pretty.

13:51.250 --> 13:54.000
I still don't get it though.

13:54.083 --> 13:58.750
If the rock's worthless, then why
did Karnage steal it from Shere Khan?

13:58.834 --> 14:02.208
Shere Khan? Is that a fact?

14:04.709 --> 14:05.792
Ow!

14:05.875 --> 14:07.041
[crashing]

14:13.542 --> 14:18.250
Maybe this night light
is worth something after all.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.625
When we get back,
we'll pay Mr. Khan a visit.

14:23.709 --> 14:25.917
Maybe there's reward moola.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.834
-[planes approaching]
-Hey, look, birdies.

14:39.667 --> 14:40.750
Attack!

14:43.250 --> 14:45.583
Why do they keep chasing me?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.792
Here goes Becky's paint job.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.917
Quick! Grab me some mangoes.

15:16.583 --> 15:20.125
Wow! Are they real pirates?

15:20.208 --> 15:24.125
Yep. And let's hope they're real hungry.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.291
[laughs] Here's fruit in your eye!

15:27.834 --> 15:29.083
[laughs]

15:31.000 --> 15:32.792
Nix that idea.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.709
-Got any rope, Baloo?
-Huh?

15:38.750 --> 15:40.458
Yahoo!

15:40.583 --> 15:45.250
-Where'd he learn that?
-I don't know, but I wanna go next.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.917
Ha! You want some dessert?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.041
[grunts]

15:50.417 --> 15:52.291
[Kit laughing]

15:53.542 --> 15:54.542
Uh-oh!

16:03.083 --> 16:05.917
I hate when that happens.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.083
Man, that kid is dynamite.
[chuckles] Whoa!

16:17.834 --> 16:20.750
[gasps] Time to get in out of the rain.

16:20.834 --> 16:22.458
Don't look, Lucy.

16:26.291 --> 16:32.208
-Boy, you are something else, kid.
-Thanks, but we're surrounded.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.917
-How do we get out of here?
-Only one way left.

16:37.709 --> 16:41.792
You cannot make the fruit salad out of me!
Follow him!

16:45.709 --> 16:47.417
Uh-oh!

16:55.667 --> 16:57.667
[all yelling]

17:01.083 --> 17:04.750
[Baloo] You know, I lose
more good cargoes that way.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.834
[Rebecca] I can't believe it.
my plane ruined,

17:09.916 --> 17:12.625
my shipment destroyed,
and I've only been in business one day.

17:13.416 --> 17:15.709
Oh, it was air pirates, I tell you.

17:15.791 --> 17:19.541
-Why would pirates want mangoes?
-Uh, vitamin C?

17:19.625 --> 17:24.250
I don't believe this for a second.
You're up to something, Baloo.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.250
But, Mommy, he's telling the truth.

17:27.375 --> 17:31.959
Molly! You took my daughter joy riding?

17:32.041 --> 17:34.792
Well, you're never going to
see your plane again, buster.

17:34.875 --> 17:38.959
Oh, no, Mommy. Me and Lucy sneaked away.

17:39.041 --> 17:43.291
And then he dumped the fruit
to save me from the pirates.

17:43.375 --> 17:48.291
I guess I owe you an apology, Baloo,
and a thank you.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.709
But that still doesn't explain
what happened to your uniforms.

17:52.500 --> 17:56.542
[Molly imitates airplane]

17:57.291 --> 18:01.291
Look out, you pirates! It's Danger Woman!

18:02.166 --> 18:03.083
[grunts]

18:03.166 --> 18:06.917
[chuckles] Say, did you get
clearance for that landing?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.250
[giggles]

18:13.417 --> 18:18.125
-Time for bed, Molly.
-Aww, I want to fly some more.

18:18.208 --> 18:21.458
Sorry, honey,
Kit and Baloo have to sleep now, too.

18:21.542 --> 18:25.417
Yeah, short stuff.
Even aces need their shut-eye.

18:32.166 --> 18:35.709
Here. So my flight crew
doesn't get chilly.

18:35.792 --> 18:38.041
Uh, gee, thanks, Miss Cunningham.

18:40.417 --> 18:42.250
-Night.
-Sleep tight.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.417
See you later, navigator.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.125
[laughs] First thing tomorrow,

18:47.208 --> 18:50.667
we lay our surprise
on old Shere Khan, right, Kit?

18:52.333 --> 18:54.458
Uh, right, Baloo.

19:03.166 --> 19:06.917
[Don Karnage singing Italian opera]

19:09.834 --> 19:11.709
[man on bullhorn] Who goes there?

19:11.792 --> 19:15.834
[grumbling] Good evening, officers.

19:15.917 --> 19:18.000
Excuse, <i>signore.</i>

19:18.083 --> 19:22.917
The young lovers, uh,
they need their privacy, <i>si?</i>

19:23.000 --> 19:24.792
<i>Grazie.</i>

19:31.542 --> 19:33.208
Now, to find that plane.

19:33.291 --> 19:38.083
Ah, but there's a 1,000 of 'em
parked in Cape Suzette, boss.

19:38.208 --> 19:43.375
Ha! Then we shall search everyone
until we find the box.

19:43.458 --> 19:47.208
[Mad Dog] I had a feeling
you were going to say that.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.208
Rise and shine, little britches.
The early bird worm's the best deal.

19:57.542 --> 19:59.542
[yawns] Oh, yeah, Shere Khan.

19:59.625 --> 20:03.792
Ooh, I'll bet we get 200 bucks
for this sparkler.

20:03.875 --> 20:07.500
You think it's smart
just walking in his office with it?

20:09.208 --> 20:12.208
Say, you're right, little britches.

20:19.375 --> 20:22.333
-Whatcha doing?
-Better leave it here.

20:22.417 --> 20:25.000
Don't want to tip our hand too soon.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.083
[crashing]

20:39.166 --> 20:41.000
Kit? Baloo?

20:46.875 --> 20:49.333
[Don Karnage] Look! This is it!

20:56.625 --> 20:57.834
Cut the engine.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.083
[Baloo] Uh, so you see, Mr. Khan, sir,

21:03.417 --> 21:08.333
if we could get the stone back,
what might it be worth to you?

21:08.417 --> 21:12.083
-Well, Mr. Balloon...
-Uh, Baloo.

21:12.166 --> 21:14.917
Yeah, that stone, as you call it,

21:15.041 --> 21:19.667
is an electrical alloy
developed by my scientists.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.792
So, that's why it zapped me.

21:21.875 --> 21:26.166
I'll make it
worth your while to return it.

21:26.250 --> 21:31.583
-What would you say to 100?
-Only a lousy 100 bucks?

21:31.667 --> 21:35.917
A hundred-thousand lousy bucks.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.917
-Dollars?
-Dollars?

21:38.000 --> 21:42.959
Sit tight, Shere-baby, we'll be back
before you can say <i>Sea Duck.</i>

21:43.166 --> 21:48.208
We did pretty good, huh?
[laughs] One hundred-thousand smackers!

21:48.291 --> 21:51.959
Oh-ho! Now I can buy my plane back
and get out of here!

21:52.041 --> 21:54.709
Now, let's grab the sparkler and scoot.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.417
Baloo, look.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.083
[Baloo] The doll's gone!

22:01.166 --> 22:03.041
Molly! Miss Cunningham!

22:03.166 --> 22:04.709
Molly! Beckers!

22:04.834 --> 22:07.417
Where are you? Where did you go?

22:07.500 --> 22:10.709
-Oh, my gosh.
-Where are you guys? Molly?

22:10.792 --> 22:12.500
Where did they go?

22:12.583 --> 22:13.959
Baloo, up there.

22:16.125 --> 22:20.291
"Unless you return the stone,
you will never see your friends again.

22:20.375 --> 22:24.875
