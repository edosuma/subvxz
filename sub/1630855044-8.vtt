WEBVTT

00:02.091 --> 00:05.084
We're ditching school
and going to Volcano Island.

00:05.084 --> 00:06.458
I've always wanted
to go there.

00:10.022 --> 00:11.323
You're the one
that lost all our money.

00:16.242 --> 00:17.564
I think I'm in love.

00:17.884 --> 00:19.485
"I lied about us going
all the way.

00:19.595 --> 00:21.100
But I have with Susan."

00:22.168 --> 00:23.545
Did you expose
that lying bastard?

00:23.545 --> 00:26.044
- It wouldn't be him who goes down.
- It would be Susan.

00:26.044 --> 00:27.233
I'm sorry...

00:27.233 --> 00:28.564
For almost killing us.

00:28.564 --> 00:29.709
You actually are
a good person.

00:29.809 --> 00:31.010
You've made it very clear

00:31.010 --> 00:32.872
that you want Beige Barb,
not me.

00:32.872 --> 00:35.083
I've decided that I'm not gonna be
second place either.

00:35.083 --> 00:36.525
If you want to ask
Olivia out,

00:36.525 --> 00:38.230
you should do it.

00:38.230 --> 00:39.718
A lot of guys want you, girl.

00:41.290 --> 00:43.082
One day it's time.
Curtain goes up,

00:43.082 --> 00:46.578
you pour your heart out, it goes by far
too fast, and then boom.

00:47.293 --> 00:49.165
Hey, do you know where I can
buy a ticket to the play?

00:49.165 --> 00:51.263
- Yes, you coming to see Buddy?
- Not really.

00:51.263 --> 00:54.956
♪ I'm finding
my flight ♪

00:56.546 --> 00:59.585
Congratulations
to Buddy Aldridge.

00:59.885 --> 01:02.341
I have to face it. I lost.

01:02.491 --> 01:04.176
Maybe we can get
Johnny Vavoom to DJ.

01:04.516 --> 01:06.145
The PTA has to approve--

01:06.145 --> 01:08.885
announcer: Johnny Vavoom
will be spinning discs

01:08.885 --> 01:10.490
at the Rydell High dance.

01:10.490 --> 01:12.752
Way to go, Buddy.

01:12.852 --> 01:13.946
You changed the results?

01:13.946 --> 01:15.835
I just did what as best
for the school.

01:15.835 --> 01:17.436
I'd rather feel
everything with you

01:17.526 --> 01:18.830
than nothing
with someone else.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.442
I hope you'll let me take you
to the dance.

01:20.562 --> 01:22.261
- Gotta go talk to Jane.
- No, Buddy.

01:22.261 --> 01:23.455
You're just gonna upset her.

01:23.455 --> 01:24.731
I wanted to tell you...

01:27.219 --> 01:29.505
I wanted to tell you
that Johnny Vavoom is gonna DJ.

01:29.505 --> 01:31.003
Sounds like you've got
two offers.

01:45.818 --> 01:48.387
Tonight, Channel 8
brings you a special report

01:48.487 --> 01:50.960
on a growing problem
of national importance.

01:51.390 --> 01:53.752
A problem that any adult
with two eyes

01:53.752 --> 01:55.852
and a moral compass
has noticed--

01:56.663 --> 01:59.531
the American teenager
is changing.

02:02.534 --> 02:04.667
Their hair is bigger,

02:05.437 --> 02:07.828
their morals looser...

02:09.408 --> 02:12.144
and their future's dimmer.

02:37.236 --> 02:39.305
Here at our very own
Rydell High,

02:39.405 --> 02:41.708
students are planning
a controversial

02:41.808 --> 02:43.442
rock and roll dance.

02:43.542 --> 02:47.364
Rock and Roll has
no place at Rydell.

02:47.364 --> 02:49.181
Get out of here!

02:49.281 --> 02:52.184
This is serious.
It's the news!

02:54.120 --> 02:55.154
Can we go again?

02:55.154 --> 02:57.512
- But what do the kids think?
- We think rock and roll

02:57.512 --> 02:58.838
is gonna bring Rydell together.

02:58.838 --> 03:00.126
Change is good.

03:00.226 --> 03:01.761
Check this out.
Come here.

03:03.162 --> 03:04.730
Mr. Class President,
do you have an comment on--

03:04.730 --> 03:06.253
Sorry, I don't want
to be interviewed.

03:06.973 --> 03:09.016
Is change good for Rydell?

03:09.376 --> 03:12.111
Or, like rock and roll music,

03:12.459 --> 03:15.007
is it too much, too fast?

03:32.291 --> 03:34.163
No! Black tie is tradition!

03:34.163 --> 03:36.002
So? Human sacrifice
used to be tradition.

03:36.002 --> 03:37.089
People let that one go.

03:37.089 --> 03:38.297
Unfortunately.

03:39.979 --> 03:42.263
What are you all doing here anyway?
You lost the election.

03:42.384 --> 03:44.570
All students can join
the dance committee.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.405
- Check the bylaws.
- We're here to make sure

03:46.505 --> 03:48.540
that the dance
is fun for everyone.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.644
No clubs, no dress code,
no expensive tickets.

03:52.764 --> 03:54.513
- Where's Buddy?
- He'll side with us.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.084
No, he won't.

03:58.184 --> 03:59.551
He's the one that got
Johnny Vavoom.

03:59.651 --> 04:01.120
He's on our side.

04:01.390 --> 04:03.850
If he's not here,
that means Susan's in charge.

04:05.514 --> 04:07.144
I agree with the Pink Ladies.

04:09.438 --> 04:10.439
- What?
- Excuse me?

04:10.879 --> 04:12.478
Their dance sounds fun.

04:12.978 --> 04:15.026
And it is what everybody wants.
Even Buddy.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.003
Susan?

04:17.103 --> 04:18.637
There's a problem, though.

04:18.935 --> 04:20.199
You have to get
the dance approved

04:20.199 --> 04:22.464
by Nicholson, the boosters,
and the PTA.

04:22.809 --> 04:23.843
And they'll never approve it

04:23.943 --> 04:25.174
if it's coming
from a girl gang.

04:29.481 --> 04:30.716
So you should let me
present it.

04:31.427 --> 04:32.444
Yeah, right.

04:32.444 --> 04:34.140
- You're nuts.
- I speak parent.

04:39.358 --> 04:42.461
We can't trust Susan.
She's Susan.

04:42.561 --> 04:43.832
But what if she's changing?

04:43.832 --> 04:45.832
I mean, we talked
during Driver's Ed

04:45.932 --> 04:48.567
and she seemed to be
rethinking a lot of things.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.256
Do you know the story
about the scorpion

04:50.256 --> 04:52.328
- and the frog?
- Ah, yes. From the Bible.

04:52.328 --> 04:53.472
Mm, it's not
from the Bible.

04:53.572 --> 04:54.941
- Is it?
- I don't know.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.843
We're Buddhists.
And I don't read.

04:56.943 --> 04:58.845
A scorpion meets a frog
at the edge of the river

04:58.845 --> 05:00.322
and asks for a ride across.

05:00.847 --> 05:02.995
The frog says,
"No way. You'll sting me."

05:03.115 --> 05:05.998
The scorpion promises not to.
So the frog agrees.

05:06.238 --> 05:08.467
But then,
halfway across the river,

05:08.585 --> 05:12.228
the scorpion stings the frog
and they both drown.

05:12.549 --> 05:14.874
Dark. You should put that
in the Bible.

05:15.145 --> 05:17.524
The moral is is that you can't change
your nature.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.598
It's in the scorpion's nature
to sting others

05:19.698 --> 05:21.667
just like it's in Susan's.

05:23.870 --> 05:25.401
- I really like that story.
- Whoa!

05:25.401 --> 05:27.039
And I'm sad
that you didn't tell me--okay.

05:30.709 --> 05:32.258
I know it's hard
to trust Susan,

05:32.258 --> 05:34.346
but she's got a point
about the PTA.

05:34.446 --> 05:36.382
That's fair. I don't do great
with parents, teachers,

05:36.482 --> 05:37.583
or associations.

05:37.683 --> 05:38.951
It's a deal with the devil,

05:38.951 --> 05:42.378
but, counterpoint,
the devil gets a lot done.

05:42.688 --> 05:43.756
He's in the Bible, right?

05:45.357 --> 05:47.126
Guess it makes sense.

05:47.226 --> 05:49.695
Can y'all move your asses?
I cannot get another tardy.

05:49.695 --> 05:51.263
Hey, come on, Richie,
we're gonna be late.

05:53.866 --> 05:55.902
Hey, what gives here, Facciano?

05:56.002 --> 05:57.904
I'd like to keep my arms
in their sockets.

05:58.004 --> 06:00.456
Buddy and Richie both asked
me to the dance.

06:00.456 --> 06:01.884
And they both swore
they changed.

06:01.884 --> 06:02.972
And I don't know
who to go with.

06:02.972 --> 06:04.520
- It's eatin' me up.
- Ah, complaining

06:04.520 --> 06:06.032
about your multiple
love interests.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.489
- So relatable.
- Yeah.

06:07.489 --> 06:09.231
We're the ones
who should be complaining.

06:09.231 --> 06:12.034
None of us has a date,
let alone two.

06:12.314 --> 06:14.046
Since when do you care
about dates?

06:14.681 --> 06:15.748
It's just the principle.

06:15.748 --> 06:17.189
You should let them drag race
for you.

06:17.189 --> 06:18.257
Then at least it'd be entertaining

06:18.257 --> 06:19.676
for the rest of us.

06:19.822 --> 06:21.218
What do you think
I should do?

06:22.938 --> 06:24.961
Well, Buddy's a rat.

06:25.711 --> 06:26.836
And Richie's my brother

06:26.836 --> 06:28.591
which is awkward
on a few levels, so...

06:31.473 --> 06:32.812
Is there a third option?

06:45.051 --> 06:46.643
I've decided to go
to the dance with...

06:46.643 --> 06:48.710
♪ Bye bye baby

06:48.825 --> 06:49.949
The Pink Ladies.

06:51.079 --> 06:52.148
Oh.

06:52.148 --> 06:53.683
It just makes sense
since we've been working

06:53.683 --> 06:55.635
so hard to get
this dance together, and...

06:56.275 --> 06:57.379
it's totally okay

06:57.379 --> 06:58.581
if you want to ask
someone else.

06:59.651 --> 07:01.347
- I didn't mean--
- It's cool.

07:02.087 --> 07:03.115
Catch you later.

07:03.115 --> 07:06.713

07:22.588 --> 07:24.290
- I've been thinking...
- Don't hurt yourself.

07:24.390 --> 07:26.155
I'm a sweet cat.
You're a cool kitten.

07:26.255 --> 07:28.300
Maybe we could pair up
over a milkshake Saturday

07:28.815 --> 07:30.197
and head over
to the dance after?

07:31.897 --> 07:33.032
Unless you want
to skip the milkshake

07:33.032 --> 07:35.562
- and go right to the cherry.
- Bye, Gil.

07:36.552 --> 07:39.919
Oh, come on, Olivia.
What gives?

07:40.767 --> 07:42.408
Are you really never gonna
give me the time of day?

07:42.508 --> 07:45.244
It's half past never.
Got a nickel?

07:46.745 --> 07:47.794
Nickel.

07:48.514 --> 07:49.622
A nickel.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.257
Hey up there, Juliet.

07:51.447 --> 07:52.704
Don't suppose
you're too famous

07:52.704 --> 07:53.946
to go to a high school dance?

07:53.946 --> 07:55.081
buff.

07:56.558 --> 07:57.790
Oh, you were asking me.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.559
I was. Didn't go great.

08:02.238 --> 08:05.004
I'm sorry. But I'm not
technically allowed to date.

08:05.304 --> 08:07.213
- Oh.
- It's probably for the best.

08:08.123 --> 08:09.596
I don't have much fun
at dances.

08:10.086 --> 08:11.230
Science nerd, remember?

08:11.590 --> 08:13.760
Okay, well, how about this?

08:14.540 --> 08:17.093
You go to the dance.
And I go to the dance.

08:17.093 --> 08:18.750
- Wally--
- But it's not a date.

08:19.045 --> 08:21.397
It's an experiment
to see if you can have fun.

08:25.081 --> 08:26.225
Okay.

08:26.613 --> 08:28.855
It's just,
I've been thinking about it all

08:28.855 --> 08:32.423
and I had this idea
to go with The Pink Ladies.

08:32.829 --> 08:34.996
Okay.
Thanks for letting me know.

08:36.773 --> 08:39.549
Hey. Are you all right?

08:40.349 --> 08:41.650
Why weren't you
at student council?

08:41.650 --> 08:42.959
Uh, I overslept.

08:43.169 --> 08:44.720
But don't worry,
I'll make sure this dance

08:44.720 --> 08:46.032
is everything you want
it to be.

09:00.847 --> 09:02.715

09:03.185 --> 09:05.324
I think you're funny as hell
and smart as hell.

09:05.324 --> 09:07.771
And, yeah, you're a knockout,
I mean...

09:09.361 --> 09:11.118
But you're more than that.

09:14.110 --> 09:15.371
And I'm more
than these dumbass lines

09:15.371 --> 09:16.496
that I give you.

09:16.966 --> 09:18.998
I just talk that way
because I'm terrified

09:18.998 --> 09:21.087
that if I tell you
how crazy I am about you

09:21.607 --> 09:25.162
and you turn me down,
that'd be it.

09:30.489 --> 09:31.654

Yeah. I-I'd love to.

12:59.829 --> 13:02.808
You keep love out of this.

13:03.329 --> 13:04.587
See you Saturday.

13:05.337 --> 13:06.583
Don't wear that.

13:16.398 --> 13:18.948
I know we're
not the most traditional match,

13:19.738 --> 13:21.521
but you can't deny
we've got a connection.

13:22.131 --> 13:23.723
Who cares
what people think anyway.

13:24.543 --> 13:27.760
So will you go
to the dance with me?

13:28.380 --> 13:29.431
Sure.

13:40.382 --> 13:41.533
Good news, girls.

13:41.533 --> 13:43.903
I turned Buddy and Richie down.

13:44.083 --> 13:46.238
Now we can all go
to the dance together.

13:48.975 --> 13:50.497
You should have filled us in
on your plan.

13:51.357 --> 13:52.499
I just got a date.

13:52.712 --> 13:54.417
- Me too.
- Also booked.

13:54.797 --> 13:56.295
In the last five minutes?

13:56.515 --> 13:58.284
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought you hated boys.

13:58.284 --> 13:59.555
People change, Jane.

13:59.676 --> 14:00.740
Catch up.

14:28.037 --> 14:29.688
Hey.

14:29.688 --> 14:30.832
You okay?

14:30.962 --> 14:32.034
No.

14:34.366 --> 14:37.557
The person that I like
is going to the dance

14:38.267 --> 14:39.642
with someone else.

14:43.602 --> 14:44.874
I know how that one hits.

14:55.347 --> 14:56.884
All my friends
always get dates.

14:58.384 --> 14:59.602
I never do.

15:00.962 --> 15:02.261
It's humiliating.

15:10.106 --> 15:11.138
Well, hey,

15:12.144 --> 15:14.226
since we're the last two losers
on the shelf...

15:21.580 --> 15:24.010
I am here today
to discuss the fall dance

15:24.130 --> 15:26.463
and the two biggest threats
to Rydell--

15:27.293 --> 15:30.269
juvenile delinquency
and rock and roll.

15:32.171 --> 15:33.202
What the hell
is she doing?

15:33.202 --> 15:34.656
Just give her a chance.

15:34.656 --> 15:36.518
Why not kill two birds
with one stone?

15:36.518 --> 15:38.680
Our dance,
held in this very gym,

15:38.680 --> 15:40.722
will be free
for students to attend.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.255
That means Rydell High's JDs

15:43.255 --> 15:45.344
who might otherwise be
prowling the streets

15:45.344 --> 15:48.344
causing trouble will be
in our very own gym

15:48.624 --> 15:51.323
under the Rydell
Code of Conduct

15:51.433 --> 15:53.680
and massive adult supervision.

15:53.680 --> 15:54.974
You have to admit,

15:54.974 --> 15:56.896
it's kind of
a brilliant strategy.

15:57.176 --> 16:00.046
And I have invited
Channel 8 news.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.464
They will come
hoping for a juicy story

16:02.464 --> 16:05.127
about rock and roll mayhem,
but what they will find

16:05.127 --> 16:08.988
is a bunch of well-behaved kids
having good, clean fun

16:08.988 --> 16:11.177
under excellent leadership.

16:13.282 --> 16:14.914
- I like it.
- Me too.

16:14.914 --> 16:16.323
Oh, just a moment.

16:17.293 --> 16:20.066
The PTA has some concerns
about this dance.

16:20.526 --> 16:22.995
Now, we have all read
the articles.

16:23.665 --> 16:28.444
Rock and roll leads
to drinking and drugs and...

16:29.939 --> 16:32.424
I-N-T-E-R-C-O-U-R-S-E.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.398
S-E-X.

16:39.986 --> 16:41.320
Mother,
what are you doing?

16:41.620 --> 16:43.272
Yeah, Miss McGee
usually handles

16:43.272 --> 16:44.376
these sort of meetings,

16:44.376 --> 16:46.488
but she's on vacation.
Ooh, la, la.

16:46.488 --> 16:48.895
Oh, I thought she was
at a family funeral.

16:49.445 --> 16:50.722
- Same result.
- She's not here.

16:50.722 --> 16:52.794
Well, the boosters
still need to vote.

16:53.029 --> 16:55.545
Dick?
I know you'll be on our side.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.469
Look, I was.

16:57.469 --> 17:00.419
But this dance
is important to my boy

17:00.419 --> 17:03.238
and I promised him
I would support it.

17:03.508 --> 17:05.093
He'll keep a leash
on these kids.

17:05.093 --> 17:07.087
That's why they made him
president after all.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.276
Okay. That's it.

17:11.135 --> 17:14.335
Principal says the kids
can have rock and roll.

17:14.435 --> 17:17.401
But the PTA will chaperone.

17:17.501 --> 17:20.427
And don't let anyone do
anything you have to spell.

17:20.736 --> 17:22.802
Good job, honey.

17:22.802 --> 17:23.937
- Thanks.
- All right.

17:24.737 --> 17:25.970
Gentlemen, shall we?

17:26.070 --> 17:28.670
Yeah.

17:38.998 --> 17:40.304
That's interesting.

17:41.635 --> 17:43.272
I know!
I am so impressed.

17:43.372 --> 17:46.039
That Susan's gotten
quite bold, hasn't she?

18:02.657 --> 18:05.008
- Oh. Hi, Polly.
- Hi, Lucille.

18:05.108 --> 18:06.739
You sound like a chipmunk.

18:13.442 --> 18:14.676
Okay, take this down.

18:14.776 --> 18:16.510
The dance has to be
the same for everyone.

18:16.809 --> 18:18.209
Ugh.

18:22.105 --> 18:23.110
Look at you!

18:23.210 --> 18:24.877
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, look at this.

18:24.977 --> 18:26.481
- Jenny!
- Girls!

18:27.831 --> 18:29.245
Why does she keep waving?

18:29.345 --> 18:30.511
Enough with the waving.

18:30.645 --> 18:32.346
I think she's trying
to be nice.

18:32.746 --> 18:34.182
I don't think
it comes naturally.

18:34.902 --> 18:36.746
Tell me the truth.
How do I look?

18:36.846 --> 18:40.312
Wow.

18:40.893 --> 18:43.512
You have outdone yourself
with yourself.

18:43.647 --> 18:44.747
Thanks.

18:44.847 --> 18:46.537
I had to throw this together
super last minute

18:46.537 --> 18:47.980
because I have been
so distracted

18:48.080 --> 18:49.541
by this stupid crush.

18:50.501 --> 18:51.748
I hope he can resist me.

18:51.848 --> 18:53.881
- Mm-hmm.
- I hope so too.

18:53.881 --> 18:54.969
Hey!

19:02.705 --> 19:04.013
One of you dames
has to help me.

19:04.663 --> 19:05.820
This thing is broken.

19:06.650 --> 19:07.993
It works better
if you don't put it

19:07.993 --> 19:09.134
on your eyebrows.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.361
Can we skip the commentary?

19:11.461 --> 19:13.508
You girls go,
I'm gonna finish setting up.

19:13.917 --> 19:16.142
Mm. Come on.
You don't even need it.

19:16.142 --> 19:17.217
Come on.

19:17.217 --> 19:18.551
- Can you just help--
- Did you eat some?

19:18.652 --> 19:21.102
- Not on purpose.
- Can I help?

19:21.652 --> 19:22.852
I've got it.

19:29.253 --> 19:31.946
I've gotta grab confetti
from the newspaper room.

19:32.486 --> 19:34.553
Try not to mess anything up
while I'm gone.

19:49.342 --> 19:52.389
If this is about me
not showing up at your office,

19:52.488 --> 19:53.756
I've decided
that I don't want to be

19:53.856 --> 19:55.222
the other woman, okay?

19:55.522 --> 19:56.863
I broke things off with Barb.

19:58.123 --> 19:59.287
Last night.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.057
Over five very long hours
that included

20:02.157 --> 20:03.754
several phone calls
to her mother.

20:04.934 --> 20:06.258
Why are you telling me this?

20:07.258 --> 20:08.889
When you didn't show up
the other night,

20:10.459 --> 20:11.999
I realized what I wanted.

20:13.892 --> 20:16.192
And it wasn't Beige Barb.

20:21.826 --> 20:24.060
No.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.694
I can't trust you.

20:25.794 --> 20:26.961
Yes, you can.

20:27.421 --> 20:29.384
I've changed. I swear.

20:31.694 --> 20:33.568
Come to my house tonight
after the dance.

20:34.828 --> 20:35.923
We'll talk.

20:41.062 --> 20:45.163
I can't.
I have a date.

20:48.230 --> 20:50.480
I came to help
with the confetti.

20:54.697 --> 20:55.865
Here.

21:10.567 --> 21:11.632
There you are.

21:11.632 --> 21:12.820
You can go right on in.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.936
I'm overdressed. I knew it.

21:37.466 --> 21:38.783
My mom made me wear this.

21:39.503 --> 21:40.671
See, if this were a date,

21:40.671 --> 21:42.367
I'd tell you
you look beautiful right now.

21:42.937 --> 21:45.445
But it's not so I can't.

21:51.038 --> 21:52.371
There's so many people.

21:52.471 --> 21:54.772
That's what makes it fun.

21:54.872 --> 21:57.205
You probably like
parades, too.

21:57.305 --> 21:58.703
Who doesn't like parades?

22:04.167 --> 22:05.674
- Oh, no.
- Wally...

22:08.340 --> 22:10.208
I just wanted
to tell you both

22:11.808 --> 22:13.675
I give you my total blessing.

22:13.675 --> 22:15.675
This makes
a lot more sense anyway.

22:15.675 --> 22:18.575
You make such a cute couple.

22:18.676 --> 22:20.108
You should get married.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.812
both: Aw.

22:33.510 --> 22:34.877
Now, when you're on camera,

22:34.977 --> 22:36.428
you tell them who you are

22:36.428 --> 22:37.979
and that you're the president.

22:38.711 --> 22:39.978
Eh?

22:40.078 --> 22:42.278
Doesn't hurt to have
the Aldridge name out there

22:42.378 --> 22:43.945
right before I announce
my campaign.

22:44.045 --> 22:45.311
Okay.

22:46.976 --> 22:48.060
Hey.

22:49.245 --> 22:50.490
Where's your arm candy?

22:51.720 --> 22:53.013
Jane turned me down.

22:54.013 --> 22:55.153
Aw, buddy.

22:56.546 --> 22:58.781
Well, you can't say
I didn't warn you

22:58.881 --> 23:01.201
not to tell her about
all that election business.

23:02.281 --> 23:05.782
Oh, ho, ho.
There's the camera crew.

23:07.181 --> 23:08.682
I didn't tell her.

23:10.543 --> 23:12.143
I-I couldn't.

23:15.163 --> 23:16.289
Probably for the best.

23:17.683 --> 23:19.549
Nicholson is never going
to admit

23:19.684 --> 23:21.316
that we threw out Jane's votes.

23:21.416 --> 23:22.684
I-I know.
But shouldn't I--

23:22.684 --> 23:24.384
It'd just upset
everyone involved.

23:24.483 --> 23:27.084
Come on.
Get yourself together.

23:29.150 --> 23:31.018
You look terrible.

24:00.421 --> 24:02.689
Oh, boys...

24:04.489 --> 24:06.389
Ta-da!

24:15.584 --> 24:17.554
You look different.

24:18.684 --> 24:20.264
Gee. Thanks.

24:21.262 --> 24:22.282
Give me that.

24:27.406 --> 24:28.489
Well?

24:29.358 --> 24:30.563
What do you think?

24:31.093 --> 24:34.214
Cut, color, proportion--

24:34.759 --> 24:36.144
you didn't nail a single one.

24:38.593 --> 24:40.294
And yet somehow
I can't look away.

24:45.761 --> 24:46.995
Wow.

24:48.428 --> 24:50.195
This is stunning.

24:55.886 --> 24:58.896
- Hi, um, Olivi--
- I'm sorry I'm late.

24:58.996 --> 25:01.153
I was just finishing
setting up.

25:01.923 --> 25:03.963
Oh. You look very handsome.

25:04.424 --> 25:05.518
You too.

25:05.764 --> 25:07.908
- I mean, beautiful, not, uh--
- I--

25:08.778 --> 25:09.931
Uh, sorry.

25:10.031 --> 25:11.964
I'm just trying
to repress my impulse

25:12.064 --> 25:13.364
to act like a cartoon wolf
right now.

25:13.464 --> 25:14.592
I--uh...

25:20.070 --> 25:21.166
How am I doing?

25:21.965 --> 25:24.470
Good.

25:25.730 --> 25:27.033
Thank you.

25:32.611 --> 25:34.331
- Hey.
- Hey, there.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.101
Guess we're both flying solo.

25:37.201 --> 25:39.601
Oh, well, actually...

25:49.624 --> 25:52.744
- Hey.
- Hey there, stud.

25:59.671 --> 26:02.366
All right, cowboy,
let's rock this rodeo.

26:08.906 --> 26:10.702
You snooze, you lose, Facciano.

26:14.172 --> 26:15.272
Mmm.

26:16.707 --> 26:18.807
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- These big sausage fingers

26:18.907 --> 26:20.287
- just get in the way.
- Oh.

26:20.707 --> 26:22.004
Let me see...

26:23.573 --> 26:26.408
Oh, I'm sorry, kids,

26:26.658 --> 26:28.929
but we won't be able to host
any of you this evening.

26:28.929 --> 26:30.909
What? Why?

26:31.009 --> 26:32.175
We've made
some recent changes

26:32.274 --> 26:35.042
- to the Code of Conduct.
- How recent?

26:35.442 --> 26:36.875
We were just in there
setting up.

26:36.975 --> 26:38.710
Well,
the new Code of Conduct,

26:38.710 --> 26:40.710
approved by the PTA
earlier today,

26:40.810 --> 26:43.310
states that dances
are a privilege.

26:43.410 --> 26:45.844
And those with permanent marks
on their records

26:45.944 --> 26:48.744
may not attend
school functions.

26:49.165 --> 26:50.438
How convenient.

26:57.096 --> 26:58.578
Mm.

26:58.712 --> 27:00.713
- Let me through.
- Hey, okay.

27:00.813 --> 27:02.146
I don't care
about the rest of these people,

27:02.245 --> 27:04.446
but you have to let Richie in,
Mrs. St. Clair.

27:04.545 --> 27:06.220
I am on a date, campeche?

27:06.879 --> 27:08.714
Sorry, Dorothy,
but rules are rules.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.564
This isn't fair.

27:10.714 --> 27:12.347
This whole thing was our idea.

27:12.447 --> 27:13.735
This is our dance.

27:16.601 --> 27:17.631
Not anymore.

27:18.580 --> 27:19.776
Let's go.

27:21.136 --> 27:22.181
Come on.

27:27.982 --> 27:29.016
Where are they going?

27:29.746 --> 27:30.810
Home.

27:30.810 --> 27:32.017
What? Why?

27:35.057 --> 27:36.133
Mom...

27:38.178 --> 27:39.277
- But, Mom, it's not that--
- I'm sorry.

27:39.277 --> 27:41.184
But we can't let
these delinquents

27:41.284 --> 27:42.351
take over the school

27:42.611 --> 27:45.184
corrupting everyone
with this rock and roll.

27:45.284 --> 27:47.219
Mom, it is just music.

27:47.329 --> 27:49.185
You will see
when Johnny Vavoom gets here.

27:49.285 --> 27:51.709
Oh, he was here. Hours ago.
I sent him home.

27:51.969 --> 27:52.980
What?

27:53.319 --> 27:55.720
Well, he didn't meet
the dress code requirements.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.720
The chest hair alone...

27:57.720 --> 28:00.031
Buddy promised everyone
that this dance would actually be fun

28:00.031 --> 28:02.054
and you are ruining everything.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.691
Did you ever think
that I have to act like this

28:06.401 --> 28:07.908
because I know all too well

28:08.148 --> 28:10.568
how easily corruptible
my own daughter is?

28:17.029 --> 28:19.419
You said we'd never talk
about that again.

28:19.659 --> 28:21.284
Well,
it's not like I want to.

28:21.937 --> 28:23.724
But with how you're acting lately,

28:23.724 --> 28:25.057
maybe you need to be reminded

28:25.156 --> 28:27.790
that fun has consequences.

28:30.557 --> 28:33.524
And we are all out of favors
with Dr. Winston.

28:34.725 --> 28:37.125
- Mom.
- Oh, I still think

28:37.225 --> 28:39.906
that Buddy Aldridge
had a right to know.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.893
Go back to the dance, Susan.

29:00.894 --> 29:03.394
We spent hours
decorating that gym.

29:03.494 --> 29:05.329
Night's young.
We could go to the drive-in.

29:06.339 --> 29:08.229
I think
I'm just gonna go home.

29:10.315 --> 29:11.365
It's flipped.

29:11.365 --> 29:13.163
You girls made
this dance happen.

29:13.603 --> 29:15.830
So let's make it happen
somewhere else.

29:19.747 --> 29:21.931
Where?
Got a spare school gym handy?

29:22.592 --> 29:24.197
We don't need a gym.

29:24.718 --> 29:25.932
What about the Frosty Palace?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.048
Can't.

29:27.048 --> 29:29.449
My parents always shut down
on dance nights

29:29.449 --> 29:30.662
because it's so slow.

29:31.072 --> 29:32.299
There's no one there.

29:37.649 --> 29:39.734
Oh, right.
Party at Frosty's.

29:39.734 --> 29:42.499
Party at Frosty's!

29:45.434 --> 29:48.321
Hmm. Shall we?
My dear.

29:48.434 --> 29:49.534
All right, everybody,
let's go.

29:49.634 --> 29:51.001
Come on. I know a way in.

29:51.101 --> 29:52.868
We just need a crowbar.

29:58.969 --> 30:00.269
Oh.

30:05.669 --> 30:07.437
Hey, Susan, what gives?

30:07.537 --> 30:09.094
This music's the pits.

30:09.094 --> 30:10.771
Yeah.
Where's Johnny Vavoom?

30:10.871 --> 30:12.864
I want him to sign
my brassiere.

30:14.045 --> 30:15.168
I don't know.

30:15.478 --> 30:17.872
- We could try to dance.
- I'm okay.

30:20.529 --> 30:21.862
Read any good books lately?

30:22.772 --> 30:24.283
I'm not much of a reader.

30:26.372 --> 30:28.040
Hey there. I--

30:28.140 --> 30:29.340
- Mmm.
- Hey!

30:29.440 --> 30:31.273
I just wanted to let
all you at home know

30:31.373 --> 30:33.707
that this shindig...

30:33.997 --> 30:35.107
Is swell.

30:35.527 --> 30:37.574
And you should definitely play
this music

30:38.074 --> 30:39.541
at your next funeral.

30:40.051 --> 30:44.173
I'm Buddy Aldridge,
big-time president,

30:44.942 --> 30:46.925
and my dad is running
for mayor soon.

30:48.226 --> 30:49.442
Shh.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.143
What the hell was that?

30:54.243 --> 30:57.810
Oh, your breath. Christ.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.700
Okay, I'm taking you home.

30:59.700 --> 31:02.077
- No. No.
- Hey.

31:02.177 --> 31:04.235
A-No.

31:14.611 --> 31:16.579
Maria,
dance is moving to Frosty's.

31:16.747 --> 31:18.446
- Pass it on.
- Got it.

31:18.546 --> 31:20.780
- Dance is moving to Frosty's.
- Let's go.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.913
- It's at the Frosty Palace.
- Huh?

31:23.013 --> 31:24.913
The dance is dead.
Going to Frosty's.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.748
Everybody's going
to Frosty's. Let's go.

31:29.748 --> 31:30.981
Dance is moving to Frosty's.

31:31.081 --> 31:32.381
I've got decorations.

31:32.481 --> 31:34.114
- It's going to Frosty's.
- It's not gonna fit.

31:34.214 --> 31:36.049
Just shove it through.

31:38.749 --> 31:41.415
- Going to Frosty's.
- Yeah, grab the balloons.

31:41.515 --> 31:44.063
- Come dance.
- Could be fun?

31:44.453 --> 31:45.516
Then we have to go.

31:45.906 --> 31:48.450
In the name of science.

31:48.550 --> 31:50.650
Dance at the Frosty Palace.
Pass it on.

31:56.451 --> 31:58.185
Psst, hey.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.018
Get your things.
The party is moving.

32:00.118 --> 32:01.452
And I need
Johnny's phone number.

32:01.552 --> 32:02.723
You got it.

32:10.486 --> 32:13.754
Please stop moving.
Oh, stop.

32:13.854 --> 32:16.154
Those are ours. Stop.

32:16.254 --> 32:17.887
Leave those--
put those all back!

Oh, that is school property!

32:22.831 --> 32:24.488
Hey! Leave those alone!

32:24.588 --> 32:26.155
Will you hold that for me?

32:26.255 --> 32:28.742
- Thank you.
- You are not permitted here.

to make them a milkshake

32:51.992 --> 32:53.465
because I'm off the clock.

32:53.465 --> 32:55.225
Don't worry.
We stopped by my house

32:55.325 --> 32:57.159
and I have all the refreshments
we need.

33:03.104 --> 33:04.894
Where'd you get
all that scotch?

33:04.894 --> 33:06.560
Raided my dad's
liquor cabinet.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.444
Sorry they're all
50 years old.

33:09.294 --> 33:10.898
Couldn't find any newer ones.

33:11.427 --> 33:13.248
Let's get this party started!

33:37.564 --> 33:39.998
Congrats on snagging
the hottest girl in school.

33:40.766 --> 33:44.132
Yeah, but I still got
my eye on someone else.

33:44.231 --> 33:46.932
Only thing is,
she turned me down cold.

34:04.858 --> 34:06.289
You can come closer.

34:12.082 --> 34:13.669
I warned you.

34:13.770 --> 34:15.771
- Don't laugh.
- I'm not. I like it.

34:15.870 --> 34:18.036
Here, I'll do it, too.

34:23.771 --> 34:26.604
Hey, Cyn?
Hey. Can we talk?

34:26.772 --> 34:28.104
No. I'm busy.

34:28.204 --> 34:29.537
I'm dancing
with my boyfriend.

34:34.305 --> 34:35.436
Good for you.

34:35.716 --> 34:39.273
But just so you know,
you can't pull that off.

35:11.678 --> 35:12.971
Too late, hot stuff.

35:25.512 --> 35:27.650
Hey.
You don't have to do that.

with you.

36:18.386 --> 36:19.986
We've had a lot of fun together,

36:20.086 --> 36:21.422
but as you've probably noticed,

36:21.422 --> 36:22.887
I'm getting interest
from other people

36:22.987 --> 36:25.220
and I don't want
to feel caged, you know?

36:26.030 --> 36:27.187
Breaking my heart, kid.

36:27.287 --> 36:29.314
But I get it. Fly free.

Oh, hell no.

Hi, have you see--never mind.

41:33.904 --> 41:34.994
Hey.

41:36.627 --> 41:37.928
You didn't let us
into your party,

41:38.028 --> 41:39.089
you can't come to ours.

41:39.528 --> 41:40.995
I know
that's what it looked like,

41:41.095 --> 41:42.995
but I-I-I really--
I really tried to get you in.

41:43.095 --> 41:44.462
Like we're
gonna believe that.

41:44.562 --> 41:46.386
Olivia, wait.
Hear her out.

41:47.095 --> 41:49.163
Are you forgetting
that this is the same girl

41:49.262 --> 41:50.930
that tried to get
my brother beat up?

41:51.030 --> 41:52.696
The girl who threw
an entire party

41:52.830 --> 41:54.330
to make sure
you weren't elected?

41:54.631 --> 41:57.831
The girl who humiliated you
at the pep rally?

41:57.931 --> 42:00.731
She's a scorpion, Jane.

42:04.065 --> 42:06.032
Yeah, well, at least
I'm not a home-wrecker.

42:06.132 --> 42:08.698
Oh, ho, ho.

42:08.833 --> 42:09.962
That's right.

42:10.533 --> 42:12.166
I saw you with Mr. Daniels.

42:12.266 --> 42:13.883
No.
No, that was last year.

42:14.433 --> 42:16.366
That means it's true.

42:18.199 --> 42:20.834
It was last year.
And today.

42:20.834 --> 42:24.468
I saw you two kissing
in his classroom

42:24.468 --> 42:26.300
right before the dance.

42:27.021 --> 42:28.201
What?

42:32.368 --> 42:33.902
Everybody calm down.

42:34.002 --> 42:35.635
I have more booze.
That'll help.

42:35.735 --> 42:36.956
Stay out of it, Dot.

42:37.836 --> 42:39.169
Why don't we all
go somewhere else.

42:39.269 --> 42:42.003
Yeah. Somewhere
without an audience.

42:43.290 --> 42:44.669
Hey. Shh, shh, shh.

42:44.669 --> 42:46.137
You think
you're so superior

42:46.237 --> 42:48.037
up there on your high horse,
Susan?

42:48.737 --> 42:50.171
You tried to make
everyone think

42:50.171 --> 42:51.524
that Jane is easy

42:51.719 --> 42:54.208
when you're the one who put out
for Buddy Aldridge.

42:54.738 --> 42:55.788
Hey!

42:56.839 --> 42:58.339
It is none of your business.

42:58.438 --> 42:59.502
Oh, that definitely means...

42:59.502 --> 43:00.780
- Just stop.
- It's true.

43:01.239 --> 43:02.305
Olivia,
what are you doing?

43:02.405 --> 43:03.672
We said
we weren't gonna tell anybody.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.372
Oh, you're on her side now?

43:05.472 --> 43:06.854
N-no. I--

43:06.854 --> 43:08.073
I'm not on anyone's side.

43:08.173 --> 43:11.261
Well, good to see
where you stand.

43:11.874 --> 43:13.473
I guess she won't be wearing
white to the deb ball.

43:16.341 --> 43:19.642
Hey.
Stop laughing at her.

43:20.441 --> 43:21.512
Or what?

43:22.842 --> 43:24.608
Ow!

43:27.508 --> 43:29.542
- We shouldn't be here.
- I was just thinking

43:29.542 --> 43:30.684
the same thing.

43:32.569 --> 43:34.977
Hey, tranquil.
Let's just go.

43:35.276 --> 43:37.598
What, you're on
her side, too?

43:38.177 --> 43:39.977
You should know
that she kissed Buddy

43:40.077 --> 43:42.710
less than 24 hours
after breaking up with you.

43:42.845 --> 43:44.011
She is fast.

43:44.111 --> 43:46.378
- What--
- Two guys in one day?

43:46.478 --> 43:48.145
It was after the election.

43:48.245 --> 43:50.112
You kissed her

43:50.112 --> 43:52.050
after you stole
the election from her?

43:54.899 --> 43:55.980
What?

43:56.847 --> 43:58.160
I came here to tell you.

43:58.910 --> 43:59.990
I swear.

44:01.947 --> 44:05.644
My dad and Nicholson
rigged the votes.

44:06.914 --> 44:09.368
Jane... Jane, please,
let me explain.

44:09.368 --> 44:10.915
- Jane, please--
- Just leave her alone.

44:12.795 --> 44:14.015
Out of my way.

44:15.982 --> 44:17.330
Richie!

44:19.119 --> 44:20.260
Richie, watch out!

44:20.390 --> 44:22.483
Aah! Again?

44:26.984 --> 44:28.851
It's the cops.
We gotta go!

44:28.851 --> 44:30.647
- Buddy!
- Let's move.

44:32.247 --> 44:34.584
Richie, stop!

44:34.684 --> 44:36.584
I was never here.

44:52.287 --> 44:56.087
- Break it up!
- Richie!

44:56.187 --> 44:58.085
Stop.
They've already got him.

45:14.237 --> 45:16.060
And that's Hydra,

45:16.550 --> 45:18.664
which takes up
more than 3% of the sky.

45:19.734 --> 45:22.344
That sounds small,
but the sky is very big.

45:23.594 --> 45:25.298
So how'd you get so into
all that up there?

45:27.465 --> 45:29.558
To get away from everything
down here, I guess.

45:35.359 --> 45:37.692
Do you think it's strange
how happy people seem

45:37.791 --> 45:38.886
to see us together?

45:39.926 --> 45:41.016
Like we belong?

45:41.861 --> 45:43.421
'Cause we're actually
very different.

45:43.960 --> 45:45.047
In some ways we're not.

45:45.917 --> 45:47.082
Well, yeah.

45:47.082 --> 45:49.101
No, I mean, I don't look
at the stars,

45:49.211 --> 45:51.245
but I do my own thing
to get away from it all.

45:53.508 --> 45:54.528
I surf.

45:54.628 --> 45:57.603
You surf? In the ocean?

45:57.723 --> 45:59.336
That's usually
where people do it.

46:00.728 --> 46:02.773
I get a lot of looks,
but once you're far enough out,

46:03.896 --> 46:05.020
you can't even see them.
