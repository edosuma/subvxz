WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:01.895
Previously on "Better Call Saul"...

00:01.897 --> 00:03.630
We can't just keep 'em alive.

00:03.632 --> 00:05.932
We gotta keep 'em
from climbing the walls.

00:05.934 --> 00:07.433
Work starts tomorrow night.

00:07.435 --> 00:10.737
I believe you will wake, Hector.

00:10.739 --> 00:12.205
I need to be able to sell my phones

00:12.207 --> 00:14.207
without worrying
about getting ripped off.

00:14.209 --> 00:15.512
They want me to run

00:15.537 --> 00:16.822
their banking division.

00:16.824 --> 00:18.877
The thing is, it'll keep paying the bills

00:18.902 --> 00:21.369
and free me up to do
the work I really care about.

00:21.371 --> 00:24.172
I have been thinking
about criminal law myself.

00:24.174 --> 00:25.874
You have to do what's best for you.

00:25.876 --> 00:27.642
Kim, you gotta do what's best for you.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.061
That chair.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.420
Okay. Great.

01:45.422 --> 01:47.188
There's just, uh,
some more boxes in the back...

05:56.247 --> 06:04.260
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:08.069 --> 06:09.903
You made it. Come on in.

06:11.473 --> 06:14.608
Picture a reception desk
right here, right?

06:14.610 --> 06:17.311
It's always nice to be greeted
by a friendly face.

06:17.313 --> 06:21.315
Now, over in this corner,
we got a fireplace

06:21.317 --> 06:23.483
with a cozy waiting area,

06:23.485 --> 06:25.919
couch, couple chairs,

06:25.921 --> 06:28.288
water cooler, electric kettle,

06:28.290 --> 06:30.190
maybe an assortment of teas.

06:30.192 --> 06:32.659
This is my office in here.

06:32.661 --> 06:36.029
Guess what?
These are all original fixtures.

06:36.031 --> 06:37.672
So, that's...

06:38.568 --> 06:40.668
Uh, we're four blocks
from the courthouse here.

06:40.670 --> 06:42.370
So, how convenient is that?

06:42.372 --> 06:45.673
Now, there's a bathroom,
and it's... it's cute.

06:45.675 --> 06:47.609
Uh...

06:50.046 --> 06:51.279
Whew.

06:51.281 --> 06:52.614
We're gonna get that cleaned out.

06:52.616 --> 06:54.249
Um, there's a shower in there,

06:54.251 --> 06:56.918
when you're buried in discovery
late at night.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.388
This is for the partner. Corner office.

07:00.390 --> 07:02.257
Lots of natural light,

07:02.259 --> 07:05.560
and that's great
for your circadian rhythms.

07:05.562 --> 07:08.129
Uh...

07:08.131 --> 07:09.931
Cherry blossoms. That's nice.

07:09.933 --> 07:11.498
And, uh...

07:12.736 --> 07:17.338
One, two, three, four, five, six.

07:17.340 --> 07:19.307
It's pretty big.

07:19.309 --> 07:23.244
Um, there's a kitchenette down the hall.

07:23.246 --> 07:25.780
Uh, it's kind of perfect for snacks

07:25.782 --> 07:29.884
or, uh, BYO lunch.

07:29.886 --> 07:33.454
Get one of those snazzy Keurigs,
put that in there.

07:33.456 --> 07:35.256
Stick a few potted plants around,

07:35.258 --> 07:36.891
make the place nice.

07:36.893 --> 07:38.826
What do you think?

07:42.599 --> 07:45.333
So, no more cellphones?

07:45.335 --> 07:48.169
No, but this is what the phones were for.

07:48.171 --> 07:49.837
So, if you were a lawyer,

07:49.839 --> 07:51.940
this would be a great place, right?

07:52.289 --> 07:54.108
If I was a lawyer?

07:56.580 --> 07:57.645
Nope.

07:58.615 --> 08:01.749
Big glass high-rise, 40th floor.

08:01.751 --> 08:03.484
Big glass high-rise.

08:03.486 --> 08:04.519
Yeah.

08:04.521 --> 08:06.354
When I'm not on my boat.

08:06.845 --> 08:08.567
_

08:12.295 --> 08:13.493
Hmm?

08:14.598 --> 08:15.997
_

08:19.970 --> 08:21.469
_

08:21.471 --> 08:23.171
Excellent.

08:24.474 --> 08:27.342
_

08:33.482 --> 08:35.515
_

08:38.221 --> 08:40.355
_

08:40.357 --> 08:42.123
Muy bien.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.626
Oh, uh, let's just hold off
on lunch for a few minutes.

08:44.628 --> 08:46.361
Just... Just set the tray on the side.

08:46.363 --> 08:47.595
Of course, Doctor.

08:48.999 --> 08:51.499
_

09:01.711 --> 09:03.111
Sorry. I'll take care of that.

09:04.581 --> 09:07.882
_

09:30.540 --> 09:34.042
Bueno. Continuemos.

09:34.044 --> 09:35.743
Hector?

09:35.745 --> 09:38.379
Hector... _

09:38.381 --> 09:42.183
Hmm? Muy bien.

09:43.581 --> 09:44.896
Este...

09:44.921 --> 09:46.821
_

09:53.496 --> 09:55.897
Anyone in particular
you want me to talk to?

09:55.899 --> 09:57.565
Or not talk to?

09:57.567 --> 10:00.535
Talk to anyone.

10:00.537 --> 10:02.303
Really, just... just have fun.

10:04.574 --> 10:07.241
Don't worry. They're gonna love you.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.181
- Yeah. Hi. How are you?
- This is Jimmy McGill.

10:13.183 --> 10:14.215
Yeah.

10:14.217 --> 10:15.583
- Welcome.
- Hi.

10:15.585 --> 10:16.718
- Nice to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.252
Ron, this is Jimmy McGill.

10:18.254 --> 10:19.687
Oh, hi, Ron.
Hey, Jimmy. Great to meet you.

10:19.689 --> 10:21.289
Hey, got to say,
I'm obsessed with your tie.

10:23.626 --> 10:25.259
No? Okay.

10:25.261 --> 10:26.794
Oh, excuse me one second.

10:26.796 --> 10:29.197
Hey, guys. Jimmy,
this is, uh, Gary and Stef.

10:29.199 --> 10:30.898
They... They work on Mesa Verde with me.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.134
Famous Gary and the famous-er Stef.

10:33.136 --> 10:34.268
Hi.

10:34.270 --> 10:36.537
Kim says you're the absolute best.

10:36.539 --> 10:38.473
I can't. Ate a lot of cake.

10:38.475 --> 10:39.874
Oh, whoa! Here it is!

10:39.876 --> 10:41.709
This is for us. Debbie, one for you.

10:41.711 --> 10:43.611
There you go. One for Zack.

10:43.613 --> 10:46.614
- Thank you.
- One for Viola. And you know what?

10:46.616 --> 10:49.550
Two for Lewis
'cause he skipped lunch to work!

10:49.552 --> 10:50.885
Aw, really?

11:15.245 --> 11:19.647
1, 2, 3, 4,

11:19.649 --> 11:23.017
5, 6, 7,

11:23.019 --> 11:25.753
8, 9, 10.

11:50.213 --> 11:52.180
- Are you taking votes?
- Yes.

11:54.517 --> 11:57.485
- Was Jill there? At the retreat?
- No. Oh, Lord.

11:57.487 --> 12:00.488
- No. Uh, she came later.
- Oh, okay.

12:00.490 --> 12:02.890
- She was a client.
- Really?

12:02.892 --> 12:04.992
- Oh, yeah.
- Do you guys do theater retreats?

12:04.994 --> 12:07.061
No, absolutely not.

12:07.063 --> 12:08.729
I think it might
be a little different this year

12:08.731 --> 12:10.865
not sweating with your co-workers.

12:10.867 --> 12:12.967
I heard Packard-Kilber
is taking their whole company

12:12.969 --> 12:14.836
to a resort outside of Santa Fe.

12:14.838 --> 12:17.371
- It's pretty... pretty ritzy.
- Mm.

12:17.373 --> 12:19.841
Oh, we're just talking
about company retreats.

12:19.843 --> 12:21.742
Oh. That's a great idea.

12:21.744 --> 12:23.144
Where we going?

12:23.146 --> 12:25.813
Sorry, pal. Employees only.

12:25.815 --> 12:26.814
Oh, darn it.

12:28.351 --> 12:30.051
I'm thinking of splurging
a little this year.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.420
You know, don't want to be
outdone by the competition.

12:32.422 --> 12:35.156
You know, word gets out
you're a cheapskate.

12:35.158 --> 12:37.225
Sure, sure. That's hard to shake off.

12:37.227 --> 12:38.759
I've... I've heard

12:38.761 --> 12:41.596
Ten Thousand Waves
is supposed to be amazing.

12:41.598 --> 12:43.064
I love that place.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.624
Or Carlsbad Caverns.

12:45.626 --> 12:47.602
I still think that Taos is number one.

12:47.604 --> 12:49.003
I love a ski trip.

12:49.005 --> 12:51.439
And I think it'd be good
for team building.

12:51.441 --> 12:54.942
Taos is... nice.

12:56.713 --> 12:58.179
Feel free to jump in.

12:58.181 --> 13:00.281
We're just spit-balling here.

13:03.052 --> 13:05.386
I don't... I mean...

13:05.388 --> 13:07.288
Well, I mean, if you're up
for adventure...

13:07.290 --> 13:09.590
...you know where the great skiing is?

13:09.592 --> 13:11.726
Well, it's Telluride.

13:11.728 --> 13:13.394
- Hmm.
- Yes.

13:13.396 --> 13:16.464
Oh, okay. It's kind of
a long drive, isn't it?

13:16.466 --> 13:20.768
Uh, that could be...
part of the fun, you know?

13:20.770 --> 13:24.405
Uh, rent one of those, uh,
fancy party buses.

13:24.407 --> 13:26.073
Stick "Sound of Music" on the TVs,

13:26.075 --> 13:27.275
and everybody sings along.

13:27.277 --> 13:28.643
Pretty soon, you're there.

13:28.645 --> 13:30.945
And I got to say,
the runs at Telluride...

13:30.947 --> 13:33.481
they make Taos look like a bunny slope.

13:33.483 --> 13:36.651
Telluride, huh?
It... It's worth considering.

13:36.653 --> 13:38.286
Mm. And parkas.

13:38.288 --> 13:39.954
Everybody's got to have parkas.

13:39.956 --> 13:41.222
Of course.

13:41.224 --> 13:44.091
No. I'm talking custom parkas.

13:44.093 --> 13:46.894
Uh, two words... client development.

13:46.896 --> 13:49.730
They see all of you out there
cutting the powder

13:49.732 --> 13:53.000
in your matching
Schweikart and Cokely parkas.

13:53.002 --> 13:54.969
Well, you're gonna make an impression.

13:54.971 --> 13:56.971
You will thank me later.

13:56.973 --> 13:58.673
You certainly don't think small.

14:01.277 --> 14:02.443
Shit. You know what?

14:02.445 --> 14:03.844
Aspen...

14:03.846 --> 14:05.680
That's where you want to go.

14:05.682 --> 14:08.449
Hey, Aspen is like Telluride on steroids.

14:08.451 --> 14:10.451
You got shopping.

14:10.453 --> 14:12.653
You got restaurants and spas.

14:12.655 --> 14:14.622
And talk about client development.

14:14.624 --> 14:16.190
It's a billionaire's playground.

14:16.192 --> 14:17.592
- Mm.
- Yeah.

14:17.594 --> 14:20.428
Jimmy, Aspen is like
a nine-hour bus ride.

14:20.430 --> 14:22.363
Yeah. You're right.

14:22.365 --> 14:24.131
You're right. Nine hours.

14:24.133 --> 14:27.268
That... That is a long time
to be sitting on a bus.

14:27.270 --> 14:28.369
Yes, it is.

14:28.371 --> 14:30.104
But what's that I hear?

14:33.476 --> 14:36.210
"I'm a private chartered jet!

14:36.212 --> 14:38.145
And I'm sorry. I'm very busy right now.

14:38.147 --> 14:41.616
I'm transporting
56 distinguished attorneys

14:41.618 --> 14:43.985
to their amazing destination.

14:43.987 --> 14:45.953
Aspen, here we come!"

14:47.890 --> 14:50.958
Come on, Rich! You're gonna love it!

15:00.536 --> 15:02.970
Well, that was something.

15:02.972 --> 15:04.262
Yup.

16:06.610 --> 16:09.577
Just a sec.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.408
He's making progress on the Stroke Scale.

18:20.410 --> 18:21.898
He started at a 30,

18:21.900 --> 18:23.311
and that number is steadily coming down.

18:23.313 --> 18:25.780
He's at a 22 right now.

18:25.782 --> 18:27.582
And he's made modest improvement

18:27.584 --> 18:29.484
in his ataxia, which is loss of...

18:29.486 --> 18:31.753
Loss of body movement. Yes.

18:33.590 --> 18:36.157
Well, this all sounds quite positive.

18:39.295 --> 18:43.498
But you know
the question that I will ask.

18:44.232 --> 18:46.567
Is it him?

18:46.569 --> 18:49.337
Is it the Hector Salamanca you knew?

18:51.174 --> 18:54.842
I think at this point, that's
almost a philosophical question.

18:54.844 --> 18:57.512
What I can tell you
is that he's more responsive.

18:57.514 --> 19:00.381
He's making incremental
improvements almost every day.

19:03.086 --> 19:07.588
I think if you see the evidence,
you'll be very encouraged.

19:10.093 --> 19:13.161
You'll see this was an
especially productive session.

19:13.163 --> 19:14.362
Mm.

19:27.110 --> 19:28.509
Muy bien.

19:28.511 --> 19:29.510
I know it may seem like a small thing.

19:29.512 --> 19:31.112
That same exchange

19:31.114 --> 19:34.015
would have taken
four times as long a month ago,

19:34.017 --> 19:37.852
and a month before that,
he couldn't respond at all.

19:37.854 --> 19:41.389
All his vital signs have improved.

19:41.391 --> 19:44.492
Also, I've been tracking his
progress using the SIS,

19:44.494 --> 19:47.495
with particular focus on hand mobility

19:47.497 --> 19:49.997
since that's his mode of communication.

19:53.903 --> 19:56.003
- Sorry. I'll take care of that.
- Has he done that before?

19:56.005 --> 19:58.506
- The cup?
- Mm.

19:58.508 --> 20:01.909
That was likely an involuntary movement.

20:21.664 --> 20:23.464
Do you think that was purposeful?

20:31.941 --> 20:33.841
You've done magnificent work.

20:33.843 --> 20:36.077
Oh. Thank you.

20:36.079 --> 20:39.380
I understand
that construction on your clinic

20:39.382 --> 20:41.449
is nearly complete.

20:41.451 --> 20:43.951
I trust the work
is to your specifications?

20:43.953 --> 20:46.220
That's putting it mildly.

20:46.222 --> 20:48.256
The new wing is simply extraordinary.

20:48.258 --> 20:51.259
We'll be able to care
for so many patients

20:51.261 --> 20:53.761
who would have been tossed aside.

20:53.763 --> 20:56.256
I've kept you from your work long enough.

20:56.281 --> 20:57.365
Oh.

20:57.367 --> 21:01.135
It is time to delegate
Mr. Salamanca's care.

21:01.137 --> 21:04.405
His recovery has been remarkable.

21:04.407 --> 21:08.075
And my gratitude to you is beyond words.

21:08.077 --> 21:09.944
Are you sure?

21:09.946 --> 21:13.114
Hector's progress is very promising.

21:13.116 --> 21:15.049
With sustained, intensive care,

21:15.051 --> 21:19.595
he may eventually learn
how to talk and even walk again.

21:22.392 --> 21:28.296
Hmm. Perhaps we should
temper our expectations.

21:30.233 --> 21:32.300
I believe the paila marina is ready.

21:49.352 --> 21:52.253
Now that the boys have
built the concrete forms,

21:52.255 --> 21:55.690
we are nearly ready to pour the walls.

21:55.692 --> 21:59.026
And when's that going to happen?

21:59.028 --> 22:02.263
First, there must be one more blast.

22:02.265 --> 22:04.699
I thought we were done with that.

22:04.701 --> 22:06.300
Almost done, yes.

22:06.302 --> 22:08.469
But we must clear that rock

22:08.471 --> 22:10.705
to make way for the elevator shaft,

22:10.707 --> 22:12.273
just one more,

22:12.275 --> 22:16.110
carefully shaped to keep
from damaging the work.

22:16.112 --> 22:18.980
And how big a pop are we talking about?

22:37.233 --> 22:44.338
_

22:45.675 --> 22:46.874
Scheisse!

22:46.876 --> 22:48.809
Hey, asshole...

22:48.811 --> 22:51.646
_

23:01.858 --> 23:05.393
_

23:25.214 --> 23:27.848
Yo, Saul. Three.

23:29.285 --> 23:31.085
Coming right up.

23:38.861 --> 23:40.528
There you go.

23:45.935 --> 23:46.934
See ya.

23:46.936 --> 23:48.436
Yes, you will.

24:13.296 --> 24:15.596
What can I do you for?

24:15.598 --> 24:17.431
This you... Saul Goodman?

24:17.433 --> 24:20.735
Uh, that's right, Officer.

24:22.305 --> 24:24.571
You, uh... You want to know
where I got it?

24:25.842 --> 24:28.509
Off a drug dealer who got sprung today

24:28.511 --> 24:31.370
'cause he was using
a drop phone that you sold him.

24:32.281 --> 24:34.115
Huh.

24:34.117 --> 24:36.417
Doesn't bother you that you're peddling

24:36.419 --> 24:39.920
to a bunch of lowlifes who use
these things to sell drugs?

24:39.922 --> 24:41.989
What my customers do with the phones

24:41.991 --> 24:43.324
after they leave my possession...

24:43.326 --> 24:45.459
that's their business.

24:45.461 --> 24:48.662
Let me ask you a favor, all right?

24:48.664 --> 24:50.197
Get your van out of here,

24:50.199 --> 24:52.633
park it in front of
a grocery store in Corrales...

24:52.635 --> 24:55.302
you know, someplace nice...
and... and sell there.

24:55.304 --> 24:57.204
You know, I'm sure there's a lot of...

24:57.206 --> 24:59.707
a lot of soccer moms
that can use some phones.

24:59.709 --> 25:01.442
I don't know.

25:01.444 --> 25:03.878
I think my customer base is right here.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.312
Get some new customers.

25:05.314 --> 25:07.348
I don't feel the need to.

25:07.350 --> 25:10.317
See, I got a permit,
and I'm collecting sales tax,

25:10.319 --> 25:12.987
and this is a legitimate business, right?

25:12.989 --> 25:15.356
So anyone who wants to buy a
phone from me is free to do so.

25:15.358 --> 25:16.857
I'm asking nicely, okay?

25:16.859 --> 25:18.926
And I respectfully decline.

25:20.129 --> 25:21.629
- You're gonna go this way, huh?
- There it is.

25:21.631 --> 25:22.730
What's it gonna be?

25:22.732 --> 25:23.864
What, it's gonna be littering

25:23.866 --> 25:25.299
or rolling through a stop sign?

25:25.301 --> 25:26.534
Hey, how about you plant
somethin'-somethin'

25:26.536 --> 25:27.968
in my glove compartment?

25:27.970 --> 25:28.953
You know what, pal?
Just take it easy, okay?

25:28.955 --> 25:30.671
Maybe this is why people need privacy.

25:30.673 --> 25:32.239
Maybe this is why they need my phones.

25:32.241 --> 25:33.707
Maybe you're the problem.

25:33.709 --> 25:35.181
Okay, so, as long as you make a buck,

25:35.183 --> 25:36.175
the whole world

25:36.200 --> 25:37.344
- can just go in the crapper?
- Yeah...

25:48.558 --> 25:50.224
No, no, no! No, no, no!

25:50.226 --> 25:51.725
He's a cop!

25:56.399 --> 25:57.898
He's a cop.

26:03.217 --> 26:04.549
5-4-5, Central.

26:04.551 --> 26:06.118
This was all just a mistake.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.721
My friend got confused, okay?

26:08.746 --> 26:09.965
He was just trying to do his job.

26:09.965 --> 26:12.032
I hired him for security.
He was trying to protect me.

26:12.034 --> 26:13.333
You're in plain clothes.

26:13.335 --> 26:14.534
He had no idea you're a police officer.

26:14.536 --> 26:15.869
Oh, he knew, all right.

26:15.871 --> 26:17.304
How?

26:17.306 --> 26:19.005
I picked him up three years ago.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.174
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:21.176 --> 26:22.809
Pickpocketing.

26:26.248 --> 26:28.415
Three years, that's a long time.

26:28.417 --> 26:31.318
I mean, how can you be sure
it's the same guy?

26:31.320 --> 26:32.652
Seriously?

26:32.654 --> 26:34.087
Officer, look, you were right.

26:34.089 --> 26:35.221
I was wrong.

26:36.525 --> 26:38.024
Were you, now?

26:38.026 --> 26:39.526
Yes. And you know what else?

26:39.528 --> 26:40.894
You will not see me out here

26:40.896 --> 26:42.729
selling my phones ever again, right?

26:42.731 --> 26:44.597
So just do me a favor.

26:44.599 --> 26:47.934
Let's just shake hands, avoid the
paperwork, and we just go home.

26:47.936 --> 26:50.203
Do ya a favor?

26:50.205 --> 26:52.572
I was asking you for a favor.

26:52.574 --> 26:53.740
Fair enough.

26:53.742 --> 26:55.007
Oh, I asked you nicely,

26:55.009 --> 26:58.578
and you told me to go screw myself.

26:58.580 --> 27:00.880
I don't... I don't think
I used those words.

27:00.882 --> 27:01.948
I...

27:01.950 --> 27:03.116
See you around.

27:45.427 --> 27:47.460
Michael.

27:47.462 --> 27:50.096
Glad that you can join me
for my happy hour.

27:50.098 --> 27:51.665
Huh.

27:54.669 --> 27:56.503
It doesn't look so happy to me.

27:56.505 --> 27:59.839
They'll feel better after...
how do you say it?

27:59.841 --> 28:02.456
Uh, Mittagsschlaefchen?

28:03.145 --> 28:05.284
When in kindergarten,

28:05.286 --> 28:07.981
the whole class has a nice, little rest.

28:07.983 --> 28:09.816
Uh, nap time.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.484
Nap time.

28:11.486 --> 28:13.253
Good.

28:13.255 --> 28:15.422
Now say "Mittagsschlaefchen."

28:16.361 --> 28:17.657
Mittag...

28:17.659 --> 28:19.626
Mittagsschlaefchen.

28:19.628 --> 28:21.161
Mittagsschlaefchen.

28:21.163 --> 28:23.663
Good. Good, Michael.

28:23.665 --> 28:25.965
- Pilsner or the lager?
- Lager.

28:25.967 --> 28:28.468
_

28:30.138 --> 28:32.419
_

28:34.632 --> 28:36.453
_

28:39.381 --> 28:41.815
He said you sound like a real Kraut.

28:43.385 --> 28:45.618
How do you say "bullshit"?

28:45.620 --> 28:47.821
Mm. "Bullshit."

28:47.823 --> 28:49.155
Yeah. That.

28:50.792 --> 28:54.127
But, really, you're one of us, Michael.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.702
"Ehrmantraut"... in German,
it comes from two words...

29:02.704 --> 29:06.172
"world" plus "strength."

29:06.174 --> 29:09.075
Yeah, I guess.

29:09.077 --> 29:10.910
What's the latest?

29:13.748 --> 29:15.749
Before we can continue,

29:15.751 --> 29:17.650
we must build a new concrete form

29:17.652 --> 29:19.686
and straighten the rebar.

29:19.688 --> 29:21.654
I'm so sorry.

29:21.656 --> 29:24.557
I'm happy to explain
the delay to Mr. Fring.

29:24.559 --> 29:26.092
You don't worry about Mr. Fring.

29:26.094 --> 29:28.542
He just wants to see it done right.

29:29.064 --> 29:30.730
Let me ask you a question.

29:30.732 --> 29:32.296
Of course.

29:33.401 --> 29:36.669
What would happen if we sent Kai
back to Germany?

29:41.910 --> 29:43.515
Not good.

29:44.045 --> 29:47.013
Kai is my best demolition man.

29:47.015 --> 29:49.115
Sure, he's a Grossmaul...
bah, bah, bah...

29:49.117 --> 29:50.917
but he's a good boy.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.652
They all are.

29:52.654 --> 29:55.221
Well, maybe that's the problem.
They're boys.

29:55.223 --> 29:57.891
Well, yes.

29:57.893 --> 29:59.959
But we need young people to do this work.

29:59.961 --> 30:01.461
Or maybe you and I will do it?

30:04.466 --> 30:07.534
They thought they were going
to be here for eight months,

30:07.536 --> 30:11.971
and they can see
we're not even halfway done.

30:11.973 --> 30:14.174
You have done a wonderful job, Michael.

30:14.176 --> 30:16.965
You brought everything we could ask for.

30:18.113 --> 30:23.138
But you can't keep men
locked away forever.

30:24.219 --> 30:30.145
They need fresh air,
a change of scenery and, uh...

30:33.762 --> 30:35.562
You understand?

30:35.564 --> 30:37.611
R and R.

30:38.166 --> 30:39.529
Hmm?

30:40.435 --> 30:41.968
Rest and relaxation.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.469
Precisely.

30:43.471 --> 30:46.787
This is what they need... R and R.

30:48.176 --> 30:49.873
Prost, Michael.

30:50.779 --> 30:52.334
Prost.

30:59.855 --> 31:01.955
2 1/2 years.

31:01.957 --> 31:03.323
Yeah, they always go for the max.

31:03.325 --> 31:05.592
Come on, now. They'll come down.

31:05.594 --> 31:08.795
PD didn't make it sound promising.

31:08.797 --> 31:12.432
The guy's... He's just a burnout.

31:12.434 --> 31:15.702
He's trying to soften you up
for an easy deal, all right?

31:15.704 --> 31:17.937
There's no way you'd do
that kind of time.

31:18.485 --> 31:19.872
You're goddamn right.

31:19.874 --> 31:21.674
You're goddamn right.

31:21.676 --> 31:23.610
Wait. Uh, what... what do you mean?

31:23.612 --> 31:25.211
I'mma bounce.

31:25.213 --> 31:26.946
I got places I can go.

31:26.948 --> 31:30.316
Ehhh. No. Uh, no, that's not
a good idea, Huell.

31:30.318 --> 31:32.685
Better than going in.

31:33.989 --> 31:36.322
Come on. You'll have a warrant on you.

31:36.324 --> 31:37.890
And that shit doesn't go away.

31:37.892 --> 31:39.626
You know, three years from now,

31:39.628 --> 31:41.794
you're pulled over
for a broken taillight,

31:41.796 --> 31:44.163
and now you're not
just a guy who shoved a cop.

31:44.165 --> 31:47.667
You're a guy who shoved a cop and ran.

31:47.669 --> 31:50.370
Well, I just won't drive
with a broken taillight.

31:50.372 --> 31:53.406
Sooner or later,
they're gonna catch up with you.

31:53.408 --> 31:55.975
They didn't catch D.B. Cooper.

32:02.884 --> 32:08.054
Why don't you, uh... Why don't
you give me a shot at this?

32:08.056 --> 32:10.390
I-I think I can fix it.

32:10.392 --> 32:12.358
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:12.360 --> 32:15.995
What if I told you you're not going in?

32:15.997 --> 32:19.065
Like not at all, not never?

32:19.067 --> 32:20.600
'Cause that's what it's gonna take.

32:20.602 --> 32:22.769
Yeah. Never. All right?

32:22.771 --> 32:25.471
Just don't skip.

32:25.473 --> 32:29.108
How you gonna do that?
You ain't even a lawyer.

32:29.110 --> 32:31.010
A lawyer.

32:31.012 --> 32:35.948
Dude, I don't need
to be a lawyer, all right?

32:35.950 --> 32:37.951
I'm a magic man.

32:37.953 --> 32:40.253
Will you have a little faith in me?

32:54.602 --> 32:57.770
See, now, I-I would help Huell
myself if I could,

32:57.772 --> 32:59.706
but I don't think
he's gonna wait around a month

32:59.708 --> 33:00.873
for me to be reinstated.

33:00.875 --> 33:03.776
Uh, you've been selling drop phones?

33:03.778 --> 33:05.144
On the street?

33:05.146 --> 33:07.780
Kim, I... I just... If we could, uh...

33:09.050 --> 33:13.553
Look, Kim... here's what I'm thinking.

33:13.555 --> 33:15.955
I did a little recon,
and the arresting officer...

33:15.957 --> 33:18.257
he has a DUI, you know, eight years ago.

33:18.259 --> 33:20.159
And he's been put on desk duty twice.

33:20.161 --> 33:21.494
I know he has anger issues.

33:21.496 --> 33:22.962
I can attest to it, right?

33:22.964 --> 33:27.300
So, we get him smelling
like a distillery,

33:27.302 --> 33:29.068
and we piss him off in court.

33:29.070 --> 33:30.570
Now... Now, he will take the bait.

33:30.572 --> 33:32.305
He will lose his cool
in front of the judge,

33:32.307 --> 33:35.007
a little stumble in there
just for dramatic effect,

33:35.009 --> 33:37.443
and I have some thoughts
on how to engineer that,

33:37.445 --> 33:40.146
but you get the gist.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.715
Next thing you know, case dismissed.

34:09.511 --> 34:10.976
Viola, can you get me case material

34:10.978 --> 34:15.648
for penal code 34-22, sections 22 to 27?

34:15.650 --> 34:17.984
Yeah. Battery on a PO.

34:17.985 --> 34:19.719
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

34:20.955 --> 34:24.123
Great. Uh, what's our first move?

34:24.125 --> 34:25.591
I'm not tearing down a cop.

34:26.728 --> 34:29.728
That's okay. You tell me.

34:29.731 --> 34:31.630
I will look into this.

34:31.632 --> 34:33.132
Not making any promises,

34:33.134 --> 34:35.568
but if it is as bad as you say it is...

34:35.570 --> 34:37.069
I don't know... maybe
there is something I could do.

34:37.071 --> 34:39.672
Maybe.

34:39.674 --> 34:42.241
Uh...

34:44.379 --> 34:46.379
Thanks, Kim.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.246
Listen. I really appreciate it.

34:49.268 --> 34:50.822
Okay.

34:57.025 --> 34:59.525
And, um, tell me
if there's anything I can do.

34:59.527 --> 35:01.082
Yep.

35:04.732 --> 35:06.766
Oh, excuse me, Jimmy.

35:06.768 --> 35:08.501
Oh, uh, Viola, can you just...

35:08.503 --> 35:10.937
- Oh.
- Thank you.

35:21.069 --> 35:23.536
Oh, I got it.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.607
Hope that wasn't a bribe.

35:27.609 --> 35:29.609
Wow. That would be one sad bribe.

35:29.611 --> 35:31.878
Not on my salary.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.880
Do you have a minute to discuss a case?

35:35.016 --> 35:37.850
Sure. I got two minutes.

35:37.852 --> 35:40.553
I can't help but think you guys
are reaching with this one.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.722
Where have I heard that before?

35:42.724 --> 35:44.357
Babineaux.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.926
Babineaux? Really?

35:46.928 --> 35:48.795
Doesn't seem like your kind of client.

35:48.797 --> 35:50.763
I disagree.

35:50.765 --> 35:53.299
To start with, the whole thing
was just a misunderstanding.

35:53.301 --> 35:58.071
Pickpocket with a rap sheet
attacks a cop in broad daylight?

35:58.073 --> 35:59.539
That's a misunderstanding?

35:59.541 --> 36:02.475
Uh, I would not call it an attack.

36:02.477 --> 36:05.146
Realistically, we should
be talking misdemeanor.

36:05.981 --> 36:07.914
It's battery on a PO.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.482
That's 18 months, plus a year...

36:09.484 --> 36:11.417
Of bitch time.
I know what you're asking for.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.685
It's excessive.

36:13.488 --> 36:15.254
He has a prior.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.123
The same officer arrested him
three years...

36:17.125 --> 36:18.925
Three years ago, but Babineaux
didn't recognize him.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.594
He... He didn't even know he was a cop.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.796
The guy drove an unmarked car.
He was in plain clothes.

36:23.798 --> 36:26.001
He... He had his back turned.

36:27.377 --> 36:29.669
I'm sorry. I don't buy it.

36:29.671 --> 36:34.440
Suzanne, I did my homework.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.576
You have five other cases
where civilians were accused

36:36.578 --> 36:38.645
of physical force
against police officers,

36:38.647 --> 36:40.647
and not once were the defendants given

36:40.649 --> 36:42.815
anything close to this kind of jail time.

36:42.817 --> 36:45.151
They weren't repeat offenders.

36:45.153 --> 36:47.320
State v. Murphy.

36:47.322 --> 36:49.355
Daniel Murphy was homeless.
He was off his meds...

36:49.357 --> 36:51.290
He head-butted a police officer.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.192
He gave him a concussion.

36:53.194 --> 36:55.428
Five months, suspended.

36:55.430 --> 36:57.964
State v. Karp... five months, suspended.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.333
- You're not seriously comparing...
- State v. Brezovich...

37:00.335 --> 37:01.934
no jail time, two months probation.

37:01.936 --> 37:03.302
No priors.

37:03.304 --> 37:07.006
Brezovich broke a cop's nose.

37:07.008 --> 37:09.042
This is unequal justice.

37:09.044 --> 37:12.178
In this case, the officer
was not injured at all.

37:12.180 --> 37:14.514
He was hit with a bag of sandwiches.

37:14.516 --> 37:15.838
How can you justify giving

37:15.863 --> 37:17.617
- Babineaux 18 months?
- Plus a year.

37:17.619 --> 37:19.452
He has no history of violence.

37:19.454 --> 37:21.854
There is no negotiation here, Kim.

37:22.307 --> 37:24.323
And honestly,
I don't understand why you want

37:24.325 --> 37:25.692
anything to do with this.

37:25.694 --> 37:27.126
On one side, I've got

37:27.128 --> 37:29.629
a decorated police officer doing his job.

37:29.631 --> 37:31.464
On the other, you have
a professional thief

37:31.466 --> 37:33.132
who threw him to the ground.

37:33.134 --> 37:36.836
And their only witness
is a scumbag, disbarred lawyer

37:36.838 --> 37:39.939
who peddles drop phones to criminals.

37:45.146 --> 37:47.380
You don't know the whole story.

37:59.327 --> 38:01.042
I'd rather talk to you in person.

38:01.044 --> 38:02.328
Are you at home?

38:02.330 --> 38:03.730
O-Okay.

38:03.732 --> 38:06.032
Is there a good place to meet you?

38:06.034 --> 38:08.167
Great. I can be there within an hour.

38:08.169 --> 38:10.403
All right, Mr. Babineaux.

38:10.405 --> 38:12.405
Sure. Huell.

38:12.407 --> 38:14.674
Just sit tight. I'm on my way.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.223
I'm gonna go talk to him right now.

38:18.225 --> 38:20.546
I need you to back my play.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.048
Does that mean what I think it means?

38:22.050 --> 38:23.783
He's gonna call you after I talk to him,

38:23.785 --> 38:25.852
and you and I have to be
on the same page.

38:25.854 --> 38:28.121
Huell can't run.

38:28.123 --> 38:31.090
He's gonna have to put on his
big-boy pants and go to jail...

38:31.092 --> 38:33.292
- Shit.
- ...at least for a little while.

38:35.463 --> 38:36.929
There's no way around it?

38:36.931 --> 38:38.965
He's not gonna do
what they're pushing for.

38:38.967 --> 38:40.466
I promise you that.

38:40.468 --> 38:42.101
But, yeah, no matter what, he's...

38:42.103 --> 38:43.603
he's gonna have to do some time.

38:45.774 --> 38:47.707
Well, thanks for trying.

38:47.709 --> 38:50.576
Jimmy, he can't jump bail.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.245
You'll back me up, right?

38:54.215 --> 38:55.481
Good.

38:57.093 --> 38:59.418
I mean, if you say this is the only way

38:59.420 --> 39:02.488
we can legitimately do this,
well, it's the only way.

39:03.725 --> 39:06.159
So, you're gonna tell him to stay put?

39:06.161 --> 39:07.760
Yeah. Sure.

39:09.230 --> 39:11.430
You do your thing. I'll do mine.

39:11.432 --> 39:12.732
Jimmy, come on. What does that mean?

39:13.902 --> 39:15.768
Don't worry.

40:39.721 --> 40:42.989
Jimmy, whatever you're doing, don't.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.860
Ya I know, but... listen.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.639
I have a better way.
