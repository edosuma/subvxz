spoke to you just moments

Yeah. But she didn't
have a tongue.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.390

Don't give me some

Afraid of ghosts?

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:18.901
Or are they afraid of taIking
to the cop who's investigating
your wife's murder?

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:21.273
They have no reason
to protect me.
