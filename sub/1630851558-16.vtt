00:08.341 --> 00:12.544
The only thing we can do is just try to
make as much money as we can and...

00:12.546 --> 00:17.182
and have a good war chest
built up. So, you start in Alaska.

00:18.551 --> 00:21.520
<i>[narrator] After securing
new ground in Alaska,</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:26.658
<i>27-year old Parker Schnabel
is heading back to the Yukon</i>

00:26.660 --> 00:33.165
<i>with his season now resting on his
deepest claim ever, Mud Mountain.</i>

00:36.836 --> 00:40.939
You know, this season we put a lot of
our eggs in the Mud Mountain basket

00:40.941 --> 00:45.044
and hopefully there's
tons of gold in there.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.579
<i>[narrator] Parker has gambled
$4 million on the claim</i>

00:47.581 --> 00:53.952
<i>and the team has already spent ten
weeks tripping and prepping the site.</i>

00:53.954 --> 00:58.023
<i>[Parker] Everybody over there, they should
be sluicing in Mud Mountain when I get back.</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:00.325
So, we'll see what
ends up happening.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.736
<i>[Mitch] The strip cut
is done and</i>

01:10.738 --> 01:13.138
we can get Big Red packed up,
moved over to Mud Mountain.

01:13.706 --> 01:17.009
Just one piece at a time here.

01:24.717 --> 01:30.489
<i>[narrator] At Indian River, the moment the
crew's been waiting for is finally here.</i>

01:30.491 --> 01:35.994
<i>Wash plant, Big Red, is ready
to take on Mud Mountain.</i>

01:38.498 --> 01:43.268

trucks, so our timing's real good here.

01:46.239 --> 01:51.643
<i>[narrator] Tests showed Mud
Mountain could hold 8,000 ounces of gold</i>

<i>If Parker's new cut delivers,</i>

01:57.785 --> 02:00.252
<i>it could be his
biggest payday ever.</i>

02:00.587 --> 02:01.920
<i>But so far...</i>

02:01.922 --> 02:05.390
What I'm seeing here,
looks like [bleep].

02:05.392 --> 02:08.193
<i>all the pans
have been poor.</i>

02:08.695 --> 02:11.797
<i>Despite that,
Parker's pushed ahead</i>

02:11.799 --> 02:15.400
<i>determined to mine out
the cut in just one season.</i>

02:16.970 --> 02:19.404
<i>[Mitch] We've moved Big Red
so many times</i>

02:19.406 --> 02:21.840
<i>but this time is different.</i>

02:21.842 --> 02:23.609
We still gotta do a lot
of maintenance on Big Red

02:23.611 --> 02:25.410
once we get it over
to Mud Mountain.

02:25.745 --> 02:28.180
<i>And we want this setup
to be perfect.</i>

02:28.182 --> 02:31.683
<i>It can't just be close. It's
gotta be right on the money</i>

02:31.685 --> 02:36.321
<i>because we're putting the best dirt
we've ever seen through this wash plant.</i>

02:40.393 --> 02:41.527
Now, we're out here today,

02:41.594 --> 02:44.863
well, it's kind of like
a symphony of heavy machinery.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.933
<i>You just gotta have all the
right pieces in the right place.</i>

02:47.935 --> 02:49.935
Otherwise, it's no good.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.377
[Tyson] You know,
down here in the good cut,

03:00.213 --> 03:01.547
we're nearing the bitter end.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.716
<i>[narrator] Four miles away,

<i>[Tyson] When we fire off
Mud Mountain,</i>

03:13.427 --> 03:16.094
<i>hopefully it frees up
some more people but</i>

03:16.096 --> 03:18.363
you never know until
you're into the thick of it.

03:23.836 --> 03:25.370

03:38.484 --> 03:41.853
It looks like it might be a little bit
heavy on the right side of the trailer here

03:41.855 --> 03:44.323
but we won't know till
we get it leveled out.

03:47.660 --> 03:50.362
<i>[narrator] To deliver Big Red
to Mud Mountain,</i>

03:50.364 --> 03:54.333
<i>they'll have to haul it down
an untested new road.</i>

We'll just check the chains, make sure
they're tight and we'll head over there,

04:00.741 --> 04:02.541
get this thing
put back together.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.110
- All right, see you over there.
- Let's do it.

04:06.479 --> 04:10.749
Houdini himself couldn't have made
that wash plant disappear that fast.

heading over to what's supposed to
be the best dirt we've ever put through it.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.029
So, I'm really excited
to see what it looks like.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.500
That plane's really slant.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.801
See how much
that thing is leaning?

04:34.173 --> 04:38.010
Now, this corner up here,
it's going to really want to lean.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.147
<i>[Mitch] Don't stop on any
corners which leans.</i>

04:42.149 --> 04:44.916
<i>That thing's really slant.</i>

04:44.918 --> 04:46.251
<i>[Mitch] He's got his hands
full right now.</i>

04:46.953 --> 04:48.220
Oh.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.222
[Mitch] She's leaning.

04:52.725 --> 04:57.062
[Mitch] Go, Stevie, go. Go, go,
go, go, go, go. Go. Don't stop.

05:03.569 --> 05:06.338
They got it.
They got the big lean there.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.244
We could've gone a little bit
more to your driver's side there.

05:12.246 --> 05:14.079
[man on radio]
<i>We know for next time.</i>

05:18.785 --> 05:20.085
We made it.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.155
And that's gotta be record time.

05:26.192 --> 05:28.093
Everybody killed it today.

05:28.528 --> 05:29.528
Good job.

05:29.595 --> 05:30.729
They have so much
maintenance to do on the plant

05:30.731 --> 05:32.931
but, man, this is a big moment
for the company.

05:32.933 --> 05:36.268
Let's, uh, put her together
and see what's in all this dirt.

05:36.270 --> 05:38.303

And it's like, tubes are falling
out, the water pump's not working,

16:26.553 --> 16:29.153
everything else, on top
of the fact it's slow as hell.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.856
- We're not doing that.
- [Fred] The problem is I spent most of our budget

16:31.858 --> 16:34.625
getting the equipment that we need besides
recovery because I figured we'd just

16:34.627 --> 16:37.428
limp through the gold cube
for the rest of the season.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.231
But that's what you do and it doesn't
work. Not everything works that way.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.333
I'm running bare bones right
now. These guys are buying

16:42.335 --> 16:45.336
their own fuel and food, like, I'm
not even providing any of that stuff.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.438
[Khara] See what you can find. Do
the research, see what you can find,

16:47.440 --> 16:50.608
as far as, some sort of better
piece of equipment for me to use.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.611
We'll go with the most cost
effective and we might just have to

16:53.613 --> 16:55.780
bite the bullet and finance
a little bit more.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.081
- [Fred] It's getting me so nervous.
- [Khara] I know.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.516
I just...
God, it makes me sick.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.052
You might not think it's in the
budget, but we're going to have to

17:01.054 --> 17:03.187
pull it out of somewhere and you're
going to have to figure it out, like,

17:03.189 --> 17:04.322
that's all we can do.

17:05.124 --> 17:06.657
[bleep]

17:18.637 --> 17:22.573
If we could get a good recovery
system, that would boost our productivity,

17:22.575 --> 17:25.743
and it's going to give us
a lot more gold at the end.

17:25.745 --> 17:30.481
<i>[narrator] Fred's headed to Dawson
City on the hunt for a new gold table.</i>

17:30.483 --> 17:32.216
Uh, right now I'm on my way
to see Joel.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.552
Joel's the gentleman that
fabricated our wash plant.

17:34.554 --> 17:39.257
<i>He's created a gold room, based
on a recovery device called the...</i>

17:39.259 --> 17:42.727
<i>It's a very good recovery
system for this type of gold.</i>

17:42.729 --> 17:46.464
<i>Right now, I'm worried about losing
gold and that's what we're doing.</i>

17:46.466 --> 17:48.866
<i>We need to up our game
and our recovery.</i>

17:48.868 --> 17:52.870
It's going to save us an average
of 20 hours every time we clean up.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.439
And we're going to lose
way less gold.

17:56.942 --> 17:58.943
[guitar strums]

18:06.618 --> 18:07.718
Always working, Joel,
how you doing?

18:07.720 --> 18:08.853
Yeah good, Fred, how you doing?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.655
I was hoping I could
get a look at that, uh,

18:10.657 --> 18:12.023
gold recovery system
you said you had.

18:12.025 --> 18:15.126
Yeah, it's just over here. We
can go have a quick look at it

18:15.360 --> 18:19.030
[Fred] Whoa! This is nice.

18:19.032 --> 18:23.201
<i>[narrator] The custom-built gold recovery
system was designed by a local miner</i>

18:23.203 --> 18:25.570
<i>35 years ago.</i>

18:25.572 --> 18:31.142
<i>Vibrating riffles and hydraulics
separate gold from the concentrate.</i>

18:32.945 --> 18:35.246
Man, I'm going to tell you,
this blows my mind,

18:35.248 --> 18:36.347
at how efficient this could be.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.150
[Joel] Yeah, that self-feeding
hopper makes it easy.

18:39.152 --> 18:43.054
You just, you know, put four pails
of dirt in it and, almost, walk away.

18:43.056 --> 18:44.222
[Fred] That is really cool.

18:44.656 --> 18:47.391
It does look pretty expensive.
[chuckles]

18:47.393 --> 18:50.361
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of work
hours in this thing and, you know,

18:50.363 --> 18:53.664
-nice, brand new seed can. Fully, you know...
-Yep.

18:53.666 --> 18:58.402
Lights, heat, and it's, uh, priced
accordingly so, cost figure, at a guess,

18:58.404 --> 18:59.837
- give or take a few.
- Yep.

18:59.839 --> 19:04.475
-It'll be about 30 k.
-Okay, all right. Well, I like what I've seen,

19:04.477 --> 19:09.881
but, um, my budget's not huge, um, so that
may be something we need to talk about.

19:09.883 --> 19:12.583
I don't know if, maybe, we could
work a deal out on some, kind of,

19:12.585 --> 19:13.384
a royalty or a payment.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.785
I don't know how you work, uh...

19:14.787 --> 19:18.389
[Joel] Yeah, I mean, possibly.
I'm open to it. It would have to...

19:18.391 --> 19:20.825
- be something we'd have to discuss.
- [Fred] Okay.

19:20.827 --> 19:24.595
<i>[narrator] If Fred can land a deal,
he'll need to return to Dawson City</i>

19:24.597 --> 19:28.166
<i>with a trailer to collect
the gold room.</i>

19:28.168 --> 19:30.535
I think the most important thing
now is just to put my head together

19:30.537 --> 19:32.603
on the budget
and then we can go from there.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.005
- Sounds good man.
- Sweet, really appreciate your time.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.840
- Pleasure doing business with you.
- Yeah, I really do too.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.042
[Fred] Hopefully get back
to work.

19:53.058 --> 19:54.392
<i>[Mitch] Now,
the million dollar question.</i>

19:54.394 --> 19:57.495
Is there enough gold in this
ground to make this cut worthwhile?

19:57.497 --> 20:02.333
<i>[narrator] On Indian River, Parker's
foreman, Mitch, and the rest of the crew</i>

20:02.335 --> 20:07.038
<i>are eager to start chewing
through pay dirt at Mud Mountain.</i>

20:08.140 --> 20:12.743
Well, we are ready to, finally, do
this. We got Big Red setup here.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.544
Here we go!

20:13.546 --> 20:15.379
[machine whirring]

20:18.317 --> 20:22.353
This is the first dirt from Mud
Mountain going through Big Red.

20:23.488 --> 20:26.624
<i>[Justin] Yeah, I don't know, if you're
the first-year guy being tasked with</i>

20:26.626 --> 20:29.927
operating Big Red at, uh, with such
high stakes at Mud Mountain here,

20:29.929 --> 20:31.462
<i>it's definitely stressful.</i>

20:31.464 --> 20:34.031
<i>[narrator] Rookie miner,
Justin Fraser,</i>

20:34.033 --> 20:38.803
<i>feeds the plant for the
first time at Mud Mountain.</i>

20:38.805 --> 20:42.607
It's still running and we're making
it work and, uh, so far so good.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.208
<i>We just got to keep it up.</i>

20:47.446 --> 20:52.416
It's super hectic and everybody
is feeling the pressure.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.663
Supposed to be a really
rich cut so, hopefully,

21:05.665 --> 21:08.399
it also lives up to
that expectation.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.274
It's a real good feeling.
It's all hands on deck here.

21:16.276 --> 21:20.278
<i>You just got to act so fast because
Parker's supposed to be back today.</i>

21:31.256 --> 21:36.594
It's been raining lots so, the road
got super slick and gross and pot-holey

21:36.596 --> 21:39.263
It definitely slows you down.

21:43.402 --> 21:49.006
We're going in to Fall and, uh,
conditions are getting pretty brutal.

21:49.008 --> 21:54.178
<i>That, along with Mud Mountain, and
hauling out muddy pay all over the place.</i>

21:57.783 --> 21:59.984
<i>[bleep] sake's, [bleep] mud.</i>

22:00.085 --> 22:02.053
Hey, Mitch, got a copy?

22:02.487 --> 22:04.155
Yeah, man, what's going on?

22:04.157 --> 22:07.658
Running some pretty sloppy
material right now and I'm struggling

22:07.660 --> 22:09.527
trying to get this pay
through the plant.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.929
Yeah, man, I know,
it's nasty down here.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.865
We're getting clogged up,
it's making a mess everywhere.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.035
-Well just hang tight. Give me a minute.
-Copy that, thanks.

22:19.938 --> 22:21.238
<i>[Mitch] Shut it down.</i>

22:23.675 --> 22:25.076
[machine powering down]

22:35.387 --> 22:36.620
<i>[Mitch] Shut it down.</i>

22:37.989 --> 22:42.193
<i>[narrator] On Indian River,
Mud Mountain is fighting back.</i>

22:42.627 --> 22:45.229
<i>And Big Red is shut down.</i>

22:46.531 --> 22:50.501
<i>Following heavy rainfall,
mud is now sloughing down</i>

22:50.503 --> 22:53.604
<i>the 60-foot high walls
of the cut,</i>

22:53.606 --> 22:56.240
<i>making the pay dirt
on the floor, wet.</i>

22:58.176 --> 23:00.644
<i>Parker is due to return any day.</i>

23:00.646 --> 23:06.550
<i>Mitch moves fast to solve the
problem, with operator, Shane Gallup.</i>

23:06.552 --> 23:10.988
We've got to fix the problem of
the mud oozing out into the cut

23:10.990 --> 23:14.859
and I think the only way to fix
this issue is, dig some bedrock,

23:14.861 --> 23:16.527
get the pay off the sides,

23:16.529 --> 23:17.695
- and then we'll make a nice burn.
- Yeah.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.598
We'll catch that mud and
then that way as we're digging

23:20.600 --> 23:23.367
over on that side of it, it's just
going to be nice, clean and dry.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.869
Then this cut'll
actually calm down

23:24.871 --> 23:27.071
- and be a lot easier--
- You can actually move forward

23:27.073 --> 23:28.172
- instead of two steps backwards.
- Yeah.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.473
Exactly

23:29.475 --> 23:32.710
The sooner we get a wall in
here, contain this mud away from

23:32.712 --> 23:35.079
the center of the cut, the
better off we're going to be.

23:36.815 --> 23:40.918
<i>[narrator] To stop mud seeping
into the cut, Mitch and Shane will use</i>

23:40.920 --> 23:45.423
<i>two 480 excavators to shift
the pay from the muddy edges.</i>

23:46.958 --> 23:52.029
<i>Then, build a barrier to protect
the cut from further sloughing.</i>

23:54.099 --> 23:55.733
Hello, Mitch?

23:55.735 --> 23:57.301
[Mitch speaking]

23:57.335 --> 23:58.502
Yeah, roger that.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.613
<i>[Mitch] So, lots of things
stacked against us here.</i>

24:09.615 --> 24:12.683
<i>And when it rains, well,
all that mud makes a mess.</i>

24:12.685 --> 24:14.084
And that's what we're
dealing with right now.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.086
Just trying to get
a handle on it.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.192
- [clunk]
- [Mitch] Ooh.

24:22.561 --> 24:25.129
Yeah, we got a problem here.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.933
- Right now, the bucket should be lowering.
- [bleep]

24:28.935 --> 24:30.067
And it's not.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.403
Come on, baby.

24:34.172 --> 24:35.439
[clunking]

24:35.441 --> 24:38.509
What that tells me is we have
an issue with our accumulator.

24:38.511 --> 24:41.979
<i>When these go flat, machine can act
really erratic because it doesn't have</i>

24:41.981 --> 24:44.682
<i>a nice, smooth, constant,
uh, pressure.</i>

24:44.684 --> 24:48.452
<i>So, we're going to grab an accumulator
and, uh, swap it out on this thing</i>

24:48.454 --> 24:51.055
and see if it fixes
it's problem here.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.593
<i>[narrator] Mitch's only hope
of drying out the cut,</i>

24:55.595 --> 24:59.396
<i>and getting Big Red running
before Parker returns,</i>

24:59.398 --> 25:03.834
<i>rides on finding a replacement
part in the boneyard.</i>

25:03.836 --> 25:06.937
If this accumulator fixes our
problem, this is going to be great.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.472
<i>But, if it doesn't fix
our problem,</i>

25:08.474 --> 25:10.241
<i>we're going to have to
dive in deeper.</i>

25:13.812 --> 25:15.813
<i>So, what I've got here
is the accumulator</i>

25:15.815 --> 25:18.983
and this helps keep
your hydraulics stabilized.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.518
So, we're going to
spin this guy off here

25:20.520 --> 25:23.320
and, uh, we're going to take
it over to the other machine,

25:23.322 --> 25:25.155
change it out,
to get us back going here.

25:32.297 --> 25:35.733
Surprising the difference that
such a small piece can make.

25:35.735 --> 25:40.037
And something we've learned over
the years, if this isn't right, uh, well

25:40.039 --> 25:41.272
you're going to wish it was.

25:44.809 --> 25:45.842
Here we go.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.947
Really hoping this fixes
all of our problems here.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.282
We will find out.

25:52.751 --> 25:54.151
[machine powering up]

25:56.154 --> 25:57.421
[Mitch] That's more like it!

25:58.523 --> 26:00.024
We got it.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.834
<i>You know, Mud Mountain's
been a struggle from the start</i>

26:10.836 --> 26:16.941
<i>and I am, uh, probably, more mentally
drained than I am physically here,</i>

26:16.943 --> 26:20.110
<i>just trying to keep the train
on the tracks.</i>

26:25.750 --> 26:27.318
And we're done here.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.654
We've taken the bedrock here,
we've built this berm

26:30.656 --> 26:33.691
and the whole length of this,
it's holding all this mud back,

26:33.693 --> 26:34.825
which is working really well.

26:34.827 --> 26:38.629
Out here, the cut,
it's nice and mud free.

26:38.631 --> 26:41.832
<i>So, probably should have been
done a lot sooner.</i>

26:41.834 --> 26:43.167
<i>But better late than never.</i>

26:46.404 --> 26:48.105
[machine powering up]

27:01.820 --> 27:05.122
<i>[Shane] Mitch has that Berm all finished
up which means trucks are hauling up</i>

27:05.124 --> 27:07.691
<i>much drier material here
for us to sluice.</i>

27:07.693 --> 27:11.028
Definitely makes things easier
up here at Big Red.

27:12.864 --> 27:15.499
[Parker] What's happening,
man? [laughs]

27:15.501 --> 27:16.667
Glad you're back.

27:16.901 --> 27:18.435
- [Parker] This looks good.
- [Mitch] We've been busy, man.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.137
[Parker] Looks like that.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.740
[Mitch] Well, we were able to finish
the airstrip while you were away.

27:22.742 --> 27:23.607
So, that's all done.

27:23.609 --> 27:24.541
We got some
Mud Mountain pay dirt

27:24.543 --> 27:26.243
- going through Big Red.
- [Parker] Good.

27:26.245 --> 27:29.880
All right, well, I mean, I'm here, is
there anything I can do to help out?

27:29.882 --> 27:32.650
Well, right now we're supposed to have our
night shift here and we have no operator so,

27:32.652 --> 27:36.253
I was going to run back to camp and
see if they slept in or where they're at.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.155
[Parker] All right, I can
hop in until they show up.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.424
[Mitch] Man, if you can keep the
plant running, that would be awesome.

27:40.759 --> 27:41.825
No worries, um, hope
they didn't pull a runner.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.861
[both laughing]

27:43.863 --> 27:45.262
- Good to see you.
- [Mitch] You too.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.437
[Parker] Here we go.

27:53.439 --> 27:56.740
It feels good to be back, you know,
I need to be making money because

27:56.742 --> 28:00.411
most of our costs this year
are in Mud Mountain

28:01.579 --> 28:04.381
and we're going to find out
if she pays off.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.893

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:00.705 --> 29:03.107
[Fred] Crossing under
the wires now. You're good.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.180
If you could come
three inches, three inches.

29:10.949 --> 29:12.049
Right there.

29:14.819 --> 29:15.786
Right there.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.221
[machine whirring]

29:23.661 --> 29:24.962
<i>[Fred] That's it.</i>

29:25.797 --> 29:27.297
[Buzz] It's a little ass heavy.

29:29.000 --> 29:29.399
It's freaking me out too.

29:30.902 --> 29:31.835
That's not good.

29:31.870 --> 29:32.803
[bleep]

29:38.610 --> 29:40.177
This thing weighs so much,
as it pushed down

29:40.179 --> 29:42.012
it's lifting up
our trailer hitch.

29:42.014 --> 29:46.750
<i>[narrator] Fred Lewis is preparing
to transport a three and a half ton,</i>

29:46.752 --> 29:49.753
<i>custom built gold room
to California Creek.</i>

29:49.755 --> 29:53.724
Looking at this trailer hitch,
there's almost no weight on it.

29:53.726 --> 29:57.294
I can lift it with two fingers,
I can lift the entire trailer

29:57.296 --> 29:59.363
so, there's a severe imbalance.

29:59.365 --> 30:03.600
Enough that if we're driving
and this latch decides not to work,

30:03.602 --> 30:07.204
poof, gold room's gone and,
uh, if we lose the gold room

30:07.206 --> 30:09.139
we're not getting it back, so...

30:10.642 --> 30:13.043
<i>We just got to figure out how
we're going to make sure it's secure.</i>

30:13.045 --> 30:15.412
- He's had an idea.
- [Fred] What you got?

30:15.414 --> 30:19.349
[Buzz speaking]

30:22.487 --> 30:24.188
[Joel] It's a good idea.

30:28.893 --> 30:33.831
<i>[narrator] To balance the container,

30:33.833 --> 30:36.967
<i>a frame between the cab

30:38.069 --> 30:39.303
Okay, let it come down.

30:42.207 --> 30:43.340
[Fred] Whoa!

30:51.049 --> 30:52.683
Okay, you're up.

30:52.685 --> 30:54.384
Okay, let me know when to stop.

30:58.890 --> 31:00.457
[Joel] I think we're good, man.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.559
It's definitely got
a tongue weight.

31:02.561 --> 31:06.763
Well, it's up to you guys. Chain it down
and I'll leave you guys to that because--

31:06.765 --> 31:08.832
-[Fred] Yep, you got it. Thanks, Joel.
-No worries.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.868
- Thanks, bud.
- [Joel] We'll be talking soon, eh?

31:10.870 --> 31:12.369
- Yeah, we'll see you soon.
- [Joel] Talk to you later.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.309
[Fred speaking]

31:21.412 --> 31:25.048
Chain, check. Chain, check.
Chain, check. And chain, check.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.183
Check.

31:26.185 --> 31:29.119
If this thing falls off or if
anything it's not because

31:29.121 --> 31:29.920
we didn't put enough
chains on it.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.421
You ready?

31:31.423 --> 31:33.223
- I'm ready.
- All right, let's do this.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.225
- Let's rock this [bleep].
- I'm gonna pucker the whole time.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.164
<i>[narrator] Fred and Buzz,</i>

31:41.166 --> 31:43.734
<i>must now cross the Yukon River</i>

<i>and drive the finely</i>

<i>to California Creek.</i>

31:53.878 --> 31:55.746
I don't like getting on
this little boat

31:55.748 --> 31:56.980
with this big truck.

31:57.815 --> 31:59.983
<i>Stay steady now.</i>

32:15.633 --> 32:18.835
<i>[Fred Lewis] I'm excited to set
this thing up though, man, because</i>

32:18.837 --> 32:20.804
it's gonna up our recovery
rate by probably 30

32:20.806 --> 32:22.139
or 40 percent.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.341
So the gold room's essential
for our success.

32:28.913 --> 32:29.880
[crashing]

32:29.882 --> 32:30.948
[rumbling]

32:41.993 --> 32:43.193
Oh, no.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.964
Man, this thing has shifted.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.298
<i>We're right here on the edge
if this thing shifts</i>

32:48.300 --> 32:49.933
any more and it comes off

32:49.935 --> 32:53.603
the weight would be balanced
really horribly and this thing could tip.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.272
So it's shifted about that much.

32:59.811 --> 33:00.877
[Buzz] We'll just tighten
this one up

33:00.879 --> 33:02.245
and keep on going, man.

33:02.914 --> 33:03.714
And we're almost there.

33:03.748 --> 33:05.282
That's right.

33:07.118 --> 33:09.152
Tighten this chain to make
sure it's as tight as it can be.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.787
So hopefully, it won't
shift any more 'cause if

33:10.789 --> 33:12.289
it falls off [bleep].

33:13.491 --> 33:15.192
So now I guess
we're going slower.

33:17.562 --> 33:19.396
[Fred] Buzz, this truck sounds
like a train.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.100
It sounds like
it's about to explode.

33:24.635 --> 33:25.736
I'm nervous, man.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.305
<i>Let's hope it doesn't
bounce off the hitch.</i>

33:33.778 --> 33:36.847
Well, the next part
is that steep downhill.

<i>dirt trail down to the plain.</i>

33:47.792 --> 33:50.127
You sure it's gonna stay
on that trailer, right?

33:50.762 --> 33:52.596
Oh, it's gonna stay
on the trailer.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.930
- We just--
- Not sure this

[Buzz] [bleep] this road.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.991
[Fred] Thank God, we made it.

34:21.526 --> 34:22.893
[sighs in relief]

34:22.895 --> 34:24.194
<i>[Fred] Made it through
the hardest part.</i>

34:25.129 --> 34:26.363
Ah, whew.

34:27.098 --> 34:28.432
Okay, I'm gonna breathe now.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.207
- Whew.
- Never mind.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.408
[both laughing]

34:38.410 --> 34:40.077
[Fred] You've got balls, man.

34:42.046 --> 34:43.747
<i>But this fantastic.
Yeah, we're gonna get</i>

34:43.749 --> 34:44.815
this thing probably tonight.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.583
I'll get set up on my shift.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.784
It'll be perfect, dude.
I think that

34:47.786 --> 34:49.853
we're not going to
be losing gold for one,

34:49.855 --> 34:53.223
it's gonna break our clean up
time from 22 hours to about 2.

34:53.225 --> 34:54.891
- [Buzz] Yeah.
- So that's huge.

34:54.893 --> 34:55.759
And, uh,

34:55.761 --> 34:56.693
it's on now.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.028
If there's gold here it's going

34:58.030 --> 34:59.196
though this
it's gonna be caught.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.997
- [Buzz] Yeah.
- [clicks tongue]

35:01.132 --> 35:02.232
One more step.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.034
Good job, dude.

36:35.092 --> 36:36.359
Get more pay to the plant.

36:36.427 --> 36:39.996
[Tony speaking]

36:41.933 --> 36:44.167
[Mike] You gotta a bit of a bottleneck
right there when they come up the hill.

36:44.169 --> 36:46.403
[Tony speaking]

36:46.405 --> 36:47.971
[Mike] Maybe put
another road in?

36:48.639 --> 36:50.340
[Tony speaking]

36:50.808 --> 36:52.409
Well you have a hillside
right next to it.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.910
You can make a road right down
on that side.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.579
So they can come up that one,

36:55.581 --> 36:57.714
dump, and then drive
right down the other one.

36:57.716 --> 36:58.615
They don't have to do
no hard turns.

36:58.617 --> 36:59.783
Faster the trucks get here

36:59.785 --> 37:01.351
the faster they can put
the breaker down.

37:05.022 --> 37:06.189
[Mike] Sounds like a plan.

37:13.197 --> 37:15.632
If I, uh, fix
this bottleneck here

37:15.634 --> 37:19.135

37:20.104 --> 37:22.672

<i>Tony's trucks.</i>

37:24.743 --> 37:28.144
<i>Preventing them from
delivering pay to the plant quickly.</i>

37:28.779 --> 37:29.779
<i>And forcing the crew</i>

37:29.781 --> 37:30.814
<i>to run the plant</i>

37:30.816 --> 37:32.182
<i>at a slower speed.</i>

37:32.750 --> 37:33.850
<i>Mike's solution?</i>

37:33.884 --> 37:34.818
<i>A new road</i>

37:34.820 --> 37:36.987
<i>and a one way system.</i>

37:37.788 --> 37:39.222
<i>[Mike] So by making two roads</i>

37:39.224 --> 37:41.858
<i>one where they always go up and
one where they always go down.</i>

37:41.860 --> 37:43.994
Should have a nice road
and settle the bottleneck.

38:02.847 --> 38:04.648
<i>So hopefully that'll help</i>

38:04.650 --> 38:07.017
get more and more pay
to the plant so we can

38:07.019 --> 38:08.985
<i>start sluicing
at a proper speed.</i>

38:27.605 --> 38:29.039
[Kevin Beets] Beautiful.

38:31.942 --> 38:33.943
<i>The more we turn up the feeder
the more yardage</i>

38:33.945 --> 38:35.812
we're gonna run through
the trommel.

38:35.814 --> 38:36.746
And that at the end of the day

38:36.748 --> 38:37.981
<i>equals more gold in the box.</i>

38:37.983 --> 38:40.083

39:34.072 --> 39:36.673
[Chris] I'd say we clean it,

39:36.675 --> 39:37.841
[Mitch] Yeah, for sure.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.476
- Let's get her washed in and we'll fire it back up.
- Yep.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.444

- Good.

- [Khara Lewis] Oh, this looks pretty good.

a nuggie in there.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.783
- [Khara] Yeah. I heard it.
- [man] That cool clunk that hit there.

42:33.785 --> 42:34.984
[Khara] Like right off the bat.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.019
[Fred] Oh yeah. Look at that.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.687
It's 11.48.

42:37.689 --> 42:38.621
So we're getting there.

42:38.623 --> 42:40.690
We're getting there. [laughs]

42:40.692 --> 42:42.525
We're getting gold
consistently now.

42:42.527 --> 42:44.193
We're dialing in our operation.

42:44.195 --> 42:46.162
We're getting more efficient
as a team.

42:46.164 --> 42:47.797
So I think our gold count's

42:47.799 --> 42:49.399
gonna keep going up.

42:49.401 --> 42:51.801
- [Fred] All right, guys.
- [Khara] We should put this back in there.

42:51.803 --> 42:53.202
You came, you saw gold,
now get back to work.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.437
Good job team.

43:07.585 --> 43:08.451
[Mike] Yep.

43:10.988 --> 43:12.889

that bottleneck

43:12.891 --> 43:13.923

43:16.962 --> 43:17.894
Yep.

43:17.896 --> 43:19.729
[Monica Beets] And then
you noticed

43:19.731 --> 43:21.764
that the excavators
take too long to go from

43:21.766 --> 43:23.766
crack to cut to cut to crack.

43:23.768 --> 43:24.867

43:25.570 --> 43:26.402
Yeah.

43:26.404 --> 43:28.271
- That's fun.
- [Kevin] That was fun.

43:31.775 --> 43:33.343
How about we weigh
all that gold up

43:33.345 --> 43:34.410
because I want to see
what you did.

45:55.787 --> 45:57.687
all the hours we put

set up.

through it.

<i>$300,000.</i>

46:40.999 --> 46:44.634
Well that's not bad actually
considering how much bull[bleep] we ran.

46:44.636 --> 46:45.868
[Mitch] Yeah, I mean that's over

46:45.870 --> 46:47.503
2 ounces an hour for the week.

46:47.505 --> 46:50.940
But, I mean,
is it five times better?

until we get into the heart

- It's not a bad first clean up then.

it's a little bit better.

47:02.886 --> 47:03.986
Yeah.

47:04.087 --> 47:05.321
Let's hope so.

47:05.789 --> 47:07.623

482 ounces for the week.

- That's not bad at all.
- No.

season total now it's 4,251.

47:15.933 --> 47:17.400

obviously,

let's not worry
about last season.

about this season, and...

47:23.541 --> 47:26.876
just get what we can get.

- in a short period of time.
- [Chris] Yeah.

47:29.647 --> 47:33.115
Well, it should be
at the mountain.

47:33.117 --> 47:36.752
According to jewelry reports,
there should be a ton of gold in there.

47:36.754 --> 47:38.087
Literally, a ton.

- [man laughing]
- [Mitch] Yeah?
