Uh, who did you say you were with?

09:09.909 --> 09:11.743
We call ourselves
the Knights of Sumeria.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.345
The who with the huh?

09:13.445 --> 09:15.080
[laughing] That's exactly what I said!

09:15.180 --> 09:16.715
- GARY: I know how this sounds...
- Wait a second.

09:16.815 --> 09:18.601
I think Kelly is bonking
one of those guys.

09:18.664 --> 09:20.452
...but I believe a Dark One
has taken human form

09:20.552 --> 09:22.287
to walk the Earth,
searching for the Book.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.023
If the demon finds it, it's a sign

09:24.123 --> 09:25.190
that the end of times are near.

09:25.290 --> 09:27.826
Dark One? He's talking about Ruby.

09:27.927 --> 09:29.161
- Who?
- Sasquatch.

09:29.261 --> 09:30.782
Oh, Ruby.

09:30.859 --> 09:32.538
GARY: But these pages
also hold the secret

09:32.631 --> 09:33.865
to destroying this evil,

09:33.966 --> 09:35.000
and your son is the key.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.236
I have to find him before it's too late.

09:37.336 --> 09:38.837
Well, you listen up, boy.

09:38.938 --> 09:42.041
My son babbled on about
"evil" just like you.

09:42.141 --> 09:45.210
It ruined his life.
It ruined my family's life.

09:45.310 --> 09:46.946
Now Ashley may have turned and run

09:47.046 --> 09:49.348
when he should have stayed and fought,

09:49.448 --> 09:52.217
but I'm sure as shit
not siccing some nut bag

09:52.317 --> 09:54.819
preaching evil mumbo jumbo on him.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.055
I got to talk to that guy!

09:56.155 --> 09:58.023
You can't. It's-it's a memory.

09:58.123 --> 10:00.859
But I'm not leaving until you
tell me how I can find your son.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.562
The fate of humanity
hangs in the balance.

10:03.662 --> 10:05.965
Look, I'm fetching some
supplies from downstairs.

10:06.065 --> 10:07.366
You got a cellar here?

10:07.466 --> 10:08.800
You better be gone when I come back,

10:08.900 --> 10:10.369
or I'm going to let you have some

10:10.469 --> 10:12.737
of Ike & Tina Turner's Greatest Hits.

10:12.837 --> 10:14.739
Mr. Williams, I'm begging you.

10:14.839 --> 10:16.641
Yeah? Well, now you can do it in High C!

10:16.741 --> 10:18.944
- [groaning, yelling]
- Ooh!

10:20.179 --> 10:22.347
[clattering echoing]

10:26.018 --> 10:28.420
Hey, dipshit. You okay down there?

10:33.592 --> 10:35.360
BOTH: Oh, boy.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.896
ASH: Holy shit, he looks dead.

10:37.997 --> 10:40.899
Is he dead? Why am I asking you?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.368
[wincing]

10:43.468 --> 10:45.937
- [crickets chirping]
- It's quiet.

10:46.038 --> 10:47.606
- Maybe he... [gasping]
- [roaring]

10:47.706 --> 10:50.109
Let me in! I just want to play!

10:50.209 --> 10:51.743
The one time I actually need my dad,

10:51.843 --> 10:53.512
and he's probably out on a beer run.

10:53.612 --> 10:56.548
Kelly, come on! It's me!

10:56.648 --> 10:59.051
Your powerful vagina.

10:59.151 --> 11:02.487
Yeah, right now you're my
powerful pain in the ass!

11:02.587 --> 11:04.023
Check for something to hold him down.

11:04.123 --> 11:06.591
There's got to be duct tape,
maybe some rope...

11:06.691 --> 11:07.926
How about guns and knives?

11:08.027 --> 11:09.928
No! That is Pablo out there.

11:10.029 --> 11:13.365
I don't want to kill him,
I want to help him.

11:16.468 --> 11:17.502
You find anything?

11:17.602 --> 11:19.638
There's nothing but nasty old man shit.

11:19.738 --> 11:22.474
God, I can't believe I share
DNA with that dipshit.

11:22.574 --> 11:25.344
Okay, you know what?
Time out for real talk.

11:25.444 --> 11:27.079
I know it seems like
Ash ruined your life.

11:27.170 --> 11:28.879
- [snarling] Kel.
- Okay, maybe he has a little bit,

11:28.958 --> 11:31.416
but, everything he's done
since he knew you existed

11:31.516 --> 11:32.917
was to protect you.

11:33.018 --> 11:35.720
That include publicly accusing
my counselor of being a demon?

11:35.820 --> 11:38.157
Yes, Brandy, because
your counselor is a demon.

11:38.257 --> 11:40.659
- Her name is Ruby, and...
- Oh, my God! Not you too!

11:40.759 --> 11:43.295
You know what? You're as
stubborn as your old ma...

11:43.395 --> 11:45.797
- Ow! Ow!
- [flesh squishing]

11:45.897 --> 11:48.500
Fucking Pablo couldn't be a vegan!

11:48.600 --> 11:50.835
Sit. I'll-I'll find
something to bandage that.

11:50.935 --> 11:53.138
Damn it. Mm!

11:54.639 --> 11:57.476
- [Kelly groaning]
- [banging outside]

11:58.043 --> 11:59.178
Kelly!

11:59.278 --> 12:00.779
So you guys are close, huh?

12:00.879 --> 12:02.447
Beyond close.

12:02.547 --> 12:06.318
Pablo and I are... bound by blood.

12:06.418 --> 12:08.387
- What, like in a family way?
- No.

12:08.487 --> 12:10.955
In the axing demons,
and getting covered in guts way.

12:11.056 --> 12:12.424
That's messed up.

12:12.524 --> 12:16.195
But Brandy, I saw Ash's picture
in that stupid Book.

12:16.295 --> 12:17.396
A demon called him "the Savior."

12:17.496 --> 12:19.564
Hold on, you don't actually
think that Ash is...

12:19.664 --> 12:21.933
Is our only hope
in the fight against evil?

12:22.033 --> 12:24.069
Hard to believe sometimes, but yeah.

12:24.169 --> 12:25.537
- [roaring]
- [shattering]

12:25.637 --> 12:28.140
- Ah!
- Oh, Kelly...

12:28.240 --> 12:29.641
[pounding] open up!

12:29.741 --> 12:32.191
I'm still hungry!

12:33.011 --> 12:34.113
We're totally fucked.

12:34.213 --> 12:37.749
Yeah, in Ash's orbit,
that's called "Tuesday."

12:37.849 --> 12:38.950
[pounding]

12:39.050 --> 12:40.452
That was your big secret?

12:40.552 --> 12:41.853
[imitating Brock] "Something so vital,

12:41.953 --> 12:44.123
"the fabric of your life may unravel?"

12:44.223 --> 12:45.957
- Yeah...
- That guy was my only hope

12:46.057 --> 12:47.559
to end this frigging nightmare, Pop!

12:47.659 --> 12:49.828
And you killed him! Why is that good?

12:49.928 --> 12:53.232
I wanted you... see I was trying
to look out for you, son,

12:53.332 --> 12:54.766
even when you thought I wasn't.

12:54.866 --> 12:58.970
Damn it, you were supposed
to get all warm and mushy.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.705
What? You just left?!

13:00.805 --> 13:02.274
Um, with a corpse in the cellar?

13:02.374 --> 13:04.876
You're damn straight.
Business was shit anyway.

13:04.976 --> 13:06.745
He took his tumble, I locked the doors.

13:06.845 --> 13:08.447
Got the hell out of here,
and never looked back.

13:08.547 --> 13:10.482
Okay, so the dead guy,
and those missing pages

13:10.582 --> 13:12.217
- are still down there?
- [stammering]

13:12.317 --> 13:14.447
Wow, okay, get me out of this memory.

13:14.705 --> 13:16.629
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [person chuckling]

13:18.523 --> 13:20.825
- [splintering]
- [door creaking]

13:27.065 --> 13:28.500
Where the hell is he?

13:30.135 --> 13:31.770
Don't look at me.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.872
Time to clean up another mess.

13:33.972 --> 13:36.107
- [action music playing]
- [buzzing]

13:37.176 --> 13:38.243
Scared are we?

13:38.343 --> 13:39.444
I've had a little experience

13:39.544 --> 13:41.780
with dead bodies in cellars, Dad.

13:45.684 --> 13:47.786
- [eerie music playing]
- [creaking]

13:49.000 --> 13:55.074

14:17.882 --> 14:20.252
Dad, you coming?

14:20.352 --> 14:22.120
[shuddering] Don't do that!

14:22.221 --> 14:23.855

- [metallic jingling]

14:57.088 --> 14:58.357
Hello.

14:58.457 --> 15:00.425
God forbid the furnace guy shows up.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.394
That bastard ate my Spam.

15:02.494 --> 15:03.928
That was my civil defense stash.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.798
The guy ate it because somebody
locked him in the cellar, Dad.

15:06.898 --> 15:08.300
He was trying to survive.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.734
Oh. Not my fault.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.803
He's the one who took the header.

15:18.310 --> 15:19.778
Pull the chain, dummy.

15:23.248 --> 15:25.517
[eerie music continues]

15:25.617 --> 15:27.519
Good luck washing that off.

15:32.457 --> 15:33.958
Good old Necronomicon.

15:35.927 --> 15:37.396
Same type of writing.

15:40.932 --> 15:43.835
- [water dripping]
- [mysterious breathing]

15:49.073 --> 15:53.011
Maybe this guy was trying
to piece something together.

15:53.111 --> 15:55.380
Something he found in these pages.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.815
[thunder rumbling]

15:58.750 --> 16:00.619
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [wind howling]

16:03.588 --> 16:06.391
Well, Pablo has this weird
writing all over him.

16:06.491 --> 16:07.959
Maybe he can decipher it.

16:09.127 --> 16:11.396
- [flames crackling]

16:24.509 --> 16:26.044
- [screaming]
- Ooh! Oh!

16:26.144 --> 16:27.346
Help!

16:27.446 --> 16:29.217
Whoa, that little hottie looks familiar.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.209
- [echoing]
- [crying]

16:30.271 --> 16:31.716
Oh, no! Oh, no...!

16:31.816 --> 16:35.454
Wait a second. That's Brandy's
musician friend, from school.

16:35.554 --> 16:37.556
[screaming, shrieking continues]

16:40.625 --> 16:41.993
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [lightning crashing]

16:44.496 --> 16:46.005
The hell is happening in there?

16:46.083 --> 16:48.400
Oh, no! [screaming]

16:50.068 --> 16:51.470
Oh!

16:51.570 --> 16:53.204
- [grunting]
- [splattering]

16:53.304 --> 16:54.573
Shit!

16:55.574 --> 16:57.175
Pop! A little help!

16:57.275 --> 16:58.309
I'm coming, son!

16:58.410 --> 17:00.479
[both grunting]

17:00.579 --> 17:02.647
I'm a ghost, dumbass, I got nothing!

17:02.747 --> 17:04.715
- [yelling, grunting]
- [slamming]

17:08.553 --> 17:10.388
[grunting continues]

17:10.489 --> 17:13.458
- [screaming]
- [cracking sound]

17:13.558 --> 17:16.861
Ahh! Ooh, ooh! My hammy!

17:16.961 --> 17:18.829
- [Ash yelling]
- [tendrils shrieking]

17:21.265 --> 17:23.334
- [slamming]
- [grunting]

17:23.435 --> 17:24.935

- [wailing]

[grunting]

17:45.023 --> 17:46.558
[panting]

17:49.227 --> 17:51.329
Whoa, that looked like it hurt.

17:51.430 --> 17:53.965
Did I mention I hate cellars?

17:54.065 --> 17:55.467
This is just great.

17:55.567 --> 17:58.503
Evil is harassing my daughter,
my father's a ghost,

17:58.603 --> 18:01.105
and I got this crazy shit in my cellar!

18:01.205 --> 18:02.373
It's time to man up, son.

18:02.474 --> 18:03.875
You got that right.

18:03.975 --> 18:06.377
I'm going to track down
this so-called Ms. Prevett,

18:06.478 --> 18:08.647
and deal with Ruby once and for all.

18:08.747 --> 18:12.617
"Prevett?" I used to go bowling
with a cutie by that name.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.719
She had that place out on Old Mill Road.

18:14.819 --> 18:18.189
You know if Ruby's using Prevett's name,

18:18.289 --> 18:19.658
maybe she's camping out there.

18:19.758 --> 18:21.159
- [air whooshing]
- Uh-oh.

18:21.259 --> 18:22.827
I think my time is up.

18:22.927 --> 18:26.164
You make sure you tell that
Brandy all about me.

18:26.264 --> 18:27.766
Just the good stuff, though.

18:27.866 --> 18:28.733
I will, Pop.

18:28.833 --> 18:32.170
Son... you're gonna be a great father.

18:32.270 --> 18:33.505
You really mean that?

18:33.605 --> 18:35.039
No. [laughs]

18:36.340 --> 18:38.276
[sighing]

18:38.376 --> 18:40.411
[thunder rumbling]

18:40.512 --> 18:41.880
[in ghostly voice] Ruby.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.047
Kaya?

18:43.147 --> 18:44.616
Is that you?

18:44.716 --> 18:47.351
The portal to the netherworld
has been established.

18:47.452 --> 18:49.320
It's only a matter of time
before the Dark Ones

18:49.420 --> 18:50.622
will break free.

18:50.722 --> 18:52.172
Well, we got to find it, and destroy it

18:52.235 --> 18:53.688
before they have a chance to escape.

18:53.765 --> 18:56.502
The Knights must be the ones
responsible for the rift.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.663
Those numbskulls are still around?

18:58.763 --> 19:01.966
One of them has made contact
with the Prophesied One.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.470
The Prophecy's begun.

19:05.570 --> 19:06.938
How can I find this knight?

19:07.038 --> 19:10.441
Where was the Book first
unleashed in these times?

19:12.310 --> 19:13.377
[whispering] The cabin.

19:13.478 --> 19:15.547
Let me help you.

19:15.647 --> 19:17.315
If the Dark Ones learn
I've been talking to you,

19:17.415 --> 19:20.018
they will swallow my soul.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.452
You owe me this.

19:21.553 --> 19:25.690
Free me, and I'll stand with you again.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.628
I'll free you when I find
a suitable host.

19:29.728 --> 19:31.563
And once the Prophesied One
is killed at the hands

19:31.663 --> 19:34.465
of his own offspring,
we'll have so much power

19:34.566 --> 19:38.302
the Dark Ones won't be able to stop us.

19:38.402 --> 19:40.438
- [thunder rumbling]
- [Kelly yelling]

19:40.539 --> 19:42.373
Help! Fuck!

19:42.473 --> 19:43.542
See what drugs you can find,

19:43.642 --> 19:46.477
like some pain killers, whatever.

19:46.578 --> 19:49.180
DEMON PABLO: Kelly...

19:49.280 --> 19:52.316
- Kelly...
- Oh, fuck.

19:52.416 --> 19:54.185
He got in. How did he get in?

19:54.285 --> 19:56.087
- Shh!
- Kelly?

You with me, Knight boy?

20:59.350 --> 21:00.819
What did you do?

21:02.453 --> 21:05.123
Pushed away the evil, just for a bit.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.891
We need to talk.

21:06.991 --> 21:10.695
You're Ruby...
the Dark One from the legend.

And you're the descendent
of those knucklehead Knights.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.434
It's a pity, I thought
I'd killed you all.

- The what?

21:39.190 --> 21:41.159
The rift you opened with the lost pages.

21:41.259 --> 21:42.360
Where is it?

21:42.460 --> 21:46.197
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

21:46.297 --> 21:48.299
But I'll tell you this.

21:48.399 --> 21:50.635
We found the Kandarian dagger.

22:10.755 --> 22:12.090

22:12.190 --> 22:14.492
and... then you're going to tell me
