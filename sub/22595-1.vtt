[labored breaths]

01:12.905 --> 01:14.437
JC.

01:14.439 --> 01:16.442
- Yo, brother.
- The last climb.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.413
- The only climb.
- The only climb.

01:22.481 --> 01:25.218
JC and Chico.

01:27.418 --> 01:29.719
In Rio de Janeiro.

01:29.721 --> 01:31.156
[Chico chuckles]

01:35.795 --> 01:38.127
Rio de Janeiro.

01:38.129 --> 01:40.564
I never thought I was going
to jump here.

01:40.566 --> 01:43.469
- Fuck yeah.
- [Chico chuckles]

01:46.906 --> 01:49.876
- Here we are.
- [bird calls]

01:51.444 --> 01:53.480
This is where we're jumping.

02:00.887 --> 02:03.489
- Are you ready, brother?
- Oh, yeah.

02:03.989 --> 02:05.156
Love you man.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.290
I love you, man.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.690
Yeah, buddy. OK.

02:07.692 --> 02:10.195
We're gonna go fly wingsuits.

02:21.806 --> 02:23.340
[Chico]
Closer to the edge, bro.

02:23.342 --> 02:24.674
You gotta clear the lip.

02:24.676 --> 02:27.177
- [JC] I'm on the edge, buddy.
- [Chico] No, no, further down.

02:27.179 --> 02:29.211
[JC] I can't. This is it, bro.

02:29.213 --> 02:30.881
[Chico]
No, no, no, that's the step.

02:30.883 --> 02:32.782
- You go from there.
- What, there?

02:32.784 --> 02:34.651
- There.
- What... That's...

02:34.653 --> 02:36.620
Yeah, that's where
you jump from.

02:36.622 --> 02:38.088
Which, where? This one?

02:38.090 --> 02:39.756
- That one, that one.
- That one?

02:39.758 --> 02:41.024
- That little thing?
- Yeah.

02:41.026 --> 02:43.427
No, this is the step,
here, the big one.

02:43.429 --> 02:45.929
- Did you go crazy?
- OK, go, go, go.

02:45.931 --> 02:47.731
- OK, relax, bro.
- Go.

02:47.733 --> 02:51.302
- You're fucking...
- Man, man, this is the step.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.838
I don't even have close
to one foot on that.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.807
They go from there.

03:02.914 --> 03:04.815
- I'm shitting myself, bro.
- Yeah, me too.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.186
OK, brother.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.186
Let's try again.

03:10.188 --> 03:11.890
Come on.

03:15.794 --> 03:18.161
[Chico] Further forward.
You're gonna hit the rock.

03:18.163 --> 03:21.197
This is as much as I can go,
bro.

03:21.199 --> 03:23.399
- [JC] Are you ready, brother?
- [Chico] Ready, bro.

03:23.401 --> 03:25.469
Fuck it. Go.

03:25.471 --> 03:28.540
[JC] Three, two, one, base!

04:20.059 --> 04:21.827
[JC] Yeah!

04:23.062 --> 04:24.597
Whoo!

04:52.992 --> 04:55.459
I'm making...

04:55.461 --> 04:58.127
I'm making a movie here.

04:58.129 --> 05:01.668
Of the state of mind and the...

05:03.302 --> 05:06.338
the passion that goes on in...

05:07.740 --> 05:10.109
doing this sport.

05:11.877 --> 05:14.379
You know?
That's what we do.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.751
[JC] <i>Everyone I know
films their jumps.</i>

05:19.418 --> 05:22.120
<i>Me, I film all of it.</i>

05:23.755 --> 05:26.889
<i>Then I edit.</i>

05:26.891 --> 05:30.159
<i>Every night,
I take the pieces of my life</i>

05:30.161 --> 05:34.366
<i>and try to fit them all
together.</i>

05:35.466 --> 05:38.204
<i>None of us know
how much time we have.</i>

05:39.605 --> 05:43.209
<i>If you're watching this,
I could already be gone.</i>

05:44.076 --> 05:45.976
<i>Remember every moment.</i>

05:45.978 --> 05:48.014
<i>That's what my father
taught me.</i>

05:51.716 --> 05:54.918
[all whoop]

05:54.920 --> 05:56.823
[JC] Hey, bro, take this camera.

06:03.528 --> 06:05.365
It looks like Mars.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.502
Wow.

06:15.406 --> 06:16.742
Are you ready, Chico?

06:20.713 --> 06:23.850
Out, in, go!

06:56.815 --> 06:58.817
[JC] Yee-hoo!

07:03.422 --> 07:05.488
- Down-winder!
- Whoa!

07:05.490 --> 07:06.925
[laughs]

07:10.295 --> 07:11.327
Yeah!

07:11.329 --> 07:14.065
- <i>Chico...</i>
- That was sick!

07:15.466 --> 07:17.933
<i>...we jumped
everywhere together,</i>

07:17.935 --> 07:20.639
<i>pushing each other
closer and closer to the edge.</i>

07:28.512 --> 07:29.945
I'm waiting for Superman.

07:29.947 --> 07:31.882
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?

07:31.884 --> 07:34.952
I can see you, bro.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.954
[JC] South Americans
aren't too good in the snow.

07:37.956 --> 07:40.193
[laughs]

07:50.802 --> 07:53.773
[JC] Chico!

08:05.117 --> 08:06.916
Damn!

08:06.918 --> 08:08.519
[JC] <i>One of the most
ridiculous things</i>

08:08.521 --> 08:11.687
<i>I have ever done
in my life, man.</i>

08:11.689 --> 08:14.860
[Chico] <i>Dos cervezas.</i>

08:56.869 --> 08:58.538
Yeah!

09:03.509 --> 09:05.876
- [car horn]
- [Ash] What's up, pussies?

09:05.878 --> 09:08.845
- Looking for a ride?
- Hey, get in the car, bro.

09:08.847 --> 09:12.516
Come on.
You're so fucking slow?

09:12.518 --> 09:14.618
- Hey, I'm Ash.
- [JC] What's up?

09:14.620 --> 09:18.421
- Ash, my friend, JC.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

09:18.423 --> 09:19.823
Oh, guys you stink.

09:19.825 --> 09:23.493
We're gonna stop at the hotel
and then we're gonna head out.

09:23.495 --> 09:24.761
We stink?

09:24.763 --> 09:26.829
Yeah, I'm the Frenchie,
but you fucking stink.

09:26.831 --> 09:28.964
Is it your old friend
over there?

09:28.966 --> 09:29.999
Yes, yes, he's...

09:30.001 --> 09:32.334
Where did you find
this specimen?

09:32.336 --> 09:35.272
He looks really special.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.605
Fuck!

09:36.607 --> 09:39.007
It's dangerous.

09:39.009 --> 09:41.478
- You've got a bus.
- Wait, wait, wait.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.713
We're not going anywhere.
Relax, relax.

09:43.715 --> 09:45.815
[horn honks]

09:45.817 --> 09:47.617
We're going nowhere.
Relax, guys.

09:47.619 --> 09:49.618
Come on,
you are jumping off mountains

09:49.620 --> 09:51.320
and you are freaking out
with my driving.

09:51.322 --> 09:52.921
I'm not becoming
a fucking statistic!

09:52.923 --> 09:54.393
Fuck you.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.730
Yeah, so why did I call
you pussies already?

09:59.432 --> 10:02.232
[JC] Bro, honestly where did
you find a girl like this?

10:02.234 --> 10:04.566
He didn't find me, I found him.
[laughs]

10:04.568 --> 10:07.906
- I don't doubt it.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:10.307 --> 10:12.642
- Do you know the boat guy?
- Hey, look, look.

10:12.644 --> 10:14.643
- French name.
- [JC] Zizi.

10:14.645 --> 10:16.079
[Chico] What does that mean?

10:16.081 --> 10:17.814
[JC]
It means you're a dick, bro.

10:17.816 --> 10:19.752
[laughter]

10:31.730 --> 10:34.864
- Where are you taking us?
- Ah, you're gonna love it.

10:34.866 --> 10:36.334
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:39.604 --> 10:43.140
- Well, guys, do you like it?
- Wow, look at this place.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.111
[JC] It's more of a rock
than an island.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.411
- [Chico] You rock, bro.
- Bye.

10:48.413 --> 10:49.546
[whistles]

10:49.548 --> 10:51.080
[Chico]
I think I left my flipflops.

10:51.082 --> 10:52.081
[Ash]
The black ones?

10:52.083 --> 10:54.318
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit, chérie.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.185
Well, he comes back in
three days so it's OK.

10:56.187 --> 10:58.588
- [laughs]
- Why are you laughing?

10:58.590 --> 11:00.022
- In two days?
- No, three days.

11:00.024 --> 11:01.925
- Three days?
- Oui.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.229
OK.

11:04.996 --> 11:07.162
Do we have everything
we need for three days?

11:07.164 --> 11:08.831
- We'll survive.
- She didn't bring beer.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.032
Do you need a beer to relax?

11:10.034 --> 11:12.469
- Bro, you just pussy-whipped.
- What can I do, yeah?

11:12.471 --> 11:13.936
What the fuck?!
I take you on an island,

11:13.938 --> 11:17.239
- you can't even appreciate it?
- We're appreciating but...

11:17.241 --> 11:19.242
Will you stop whining
like a baby? Come on!

11:19.244 --> 11:22.045
[JC] Yo, bro, honestly,
your girlfriend is the shit.

11:22.047 --> 11:24.414
This is special.
That's the word.

11:24.416 --> 11:25.581
Special.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.450
Just look into the camera
all the time.

11:27.452 --> 11:29.822
This is why he needs a friend.
He needs like...

11:32.191 --> 11:34.723
This is special,
that's the word.

11:34.725 --> 11:36.025
Special.

11:36.027 --> 11:37.627
Just look into
the camera all the time.

11:37.629 --> 11:39.831
This is why he needs a friend.
He needs like...

11:40.765 --> 11:42.965
He needs a friend.
He needs like...

11:42.967 --> 11:45.003
He needs a friend.
He needs like...

11:46.337 --> 11:49.040
[JC breaths]

12:00.184 --> 12:03.185
- In the island.
- [laughter]

12:03.187 --> 12:07.323
[JC with faux French accent]
In the language of the French,

12:07.325 --> 12:11.594
everywhere that starts
with a "er"...

12:11.596 --> 12:13.363
You don't pronounce everything.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.998
Yeah, it's pretty efficient.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.233
You say "eu"
at the end of every word.

12:17.235 --> 12:18.334
[Ash] How do you know?

12:18.336 --> 12:20.940
Because er...
<i>je parle français en fait.</i>

12:22.106 --> 12:24.610
[speaks French]

12:27.812 --> 12:30.814
You speak French?
Motherfucker!

12:30.816 --> 12:34.818
Yeah, your mother taught me,
buddy. [chuckles]

12:34.820 --> 12:37.186
[JC] Yo, bro, if sometimes
I make a mother joke,

12:37.188 --> 12:38.454
don't take it too seriously,

12:38.456 --> 12:40.290
because I really love
mother jokes, yeah?

12:40.292 --> 12:41.590
Is that OK?

12:41.592 --> 12:44.026
Because last time
I saw a sunset like this,

12:44.028 --> 12:46.631
I was with your mother.
[laughs heartily]

12:50.168 --> 12:52.435
[Chico] Oh, my mother is
far away from here.

12:52.437 --> 12:54.673
[JC laughs]

12:56.140 --> 12:59.310
Dude, you're still filming
everything, huh?

13:00.412 --> 13:03.081
Man, it's my way of
remembering stuff, huh?

13:03.948 --> 13:06.249
What you gonna do with that?

13:06.251 --> 13:10.020
Like, I understand
that you film, like, a little,

13:10.022 --> 13:13.989
but, er... you haven't stopped.

13:13.991 --> 13:20.430
I think part of me is trying
to remember all the lessons

13:20.432 --> 13:24.501
that I learn from
different places,

13:24.503 --> 13:27.637
different moments,
where I've been.

13:27.639 --> 13:30.706
If I look back, if I can do that

13:30.708 --> 13:32.775
and I can see
how I was behaving

13:32.777 --> 13:34.743
and how my mentality was,

13:34.745 --> 13:37.480
if I was happier,
if I wasn't happy,

13:37.482 --> 13:39.114
and then maybe
five years later

13:39.116 --> 13:41.783
I'm doing something different.

13:41.785 --> 13:43.219
Right? Maybe five years later,

13:43.221 --> 13:46.189
maybe I'm stuck in an office
working too much

13:46.191 --> 13:48.858
and I don't get out and I don't
come here and sit on the orca.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.259
[Chico chuckles]
And with your umbrella.

13:51.261 --> 13:53.396
And play with a sombrero.

13:53.398 --> 13:55.768
You know, like I can...

13:59.236 --> 14:01.606
I know I will have
fucked up then.

14:11.349 --> 14:13.319
[JC] <i>Sun rises and sets.</i>

14:14.653 --> 14:16.889
<i>Seasons come and go.</i>

14:19.124 --> 14:21.493
<i>But nothing ever changes.</i>

14:24.328 --> 14:26.796
<i>I felt in that moment
that Chico and I</i>

14:26.798 --> 14:28.500
<i>would go on forever.</i>

14:33.605 --> 14:35.972
- Come here.
- Oh, it's like a group hug.

14:35.974 --> 14:37.640
Yeah.

14:37.642 --> 14:41.109
Family hug.

14:41.111 --> 14:43.581
- [laughter]
- Family hug.

14:47.418 --> 14:50.221
[Ash] Guys, you're awesome.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.234
[Ash] Whoo!

15:17.014 --> 15:19.150
<i>I always loved the outdoors.</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:23.923
<i>Camping, climbing,
making fires.</i>

15:27.192 --> 15:29.894
<i>Dad was everything to me.</i>

15:30.928 --> 15:34.565
<i>He was Spider-Man
and Superman.</i>

15:36.201 --> 15:38.003
<i>I thought he was unbreakable.</i>

15:41.005 --> 15:42.774
<i>He wasn't.</i>

15:49.581 --> 15:51.147
Whoa!

15:51.149 --> 15:52.817
Oh!

15:53.585 --> 15:55.854
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

16:11.370 --> 16:13.272
High five!

16:18.809 --> 16:21.179
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

16:31.722 --> 16:33.692
Yeah!

16:37.796 --> 16:41.830
[laughter]

16:41.832 --> 16:45.301
- [Chico] Where are we landing?
- [JC] I don't know, there!

16:45.303 --> 16:47.372
[Chico laughs]

16:48.940 --> 16:50.876
[laughs]

16:54.178 --> 16:56.145
Oh, man!

16:56.147 --> 16:57.613
[Ash] What the fuck?!

16:57.615 --> 17:00.517
I thought you were
going for a swim.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.052
He was good.
He was awesome.

17:03.054 --> 17:04.887
You're the only one missing,
Ash,

17:04.890 --> 17:06.521
You're supposed
to do a jump with us.

17:06.522 --> 17:07.656
Yeah, sure.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.558
You know, like this over
the sea and the beach.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.093
Oh, yes, like that.

17:11.095 --> 17:12.428
- Whoo!
- Come on.

17:12.430 --> 17:15.332
From a flying lawnmower?
No, thanks.

17:15.334 --> 17:16.699
Then you get to jump

17:16.701 --> 17:19.669
with two awesome,
good-looking guys like us.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.938
You know?

with him jumping?

18:21.199 --> 18:22.965
Oh, silence.

18:22.967 --> 18:25.834
Are you actually filming
everything honestly right now?

For being so tough,
you surely have some soft side.

Yeah, I have soft side.

18:30.842 --> 18:32.444
Are you afraid?

when you jump?

18:35.180 --> 18:36.446
Of course.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.215
So, yes, of course, I'm afraid.

18:39.217 --> 18:41.883
Maybe you should consider taking
a jump off a rock one day.

a good friend of the pilot

20:00.699 --> 20:05.634

20:05.636 --> 20:08.539
We're gonna get
to get closer to Christ.

Good to see you, man.

- Long time, man.
- It's been a long time, yeah.

20:16.280 --> 20:19.382
I'll arrange with the pilot
so that we can get in quick,

20:19.384 --> 20:22.183
get the right jump run,
get the right line of flight.

20:22.185 --> 20:24.587
You know, we can exit,
time it right,

20:24.589 --> 20:28.924

in such a risk.

22:46.497 --> 22:49.431
She doesn't even know
that you are here.

22:49.433 --> 22:55.036
I didn't tell her. She would've
freaked out just knowing that.

doing something, you know.

one more rope, I think,

Keep on picking up speed.
The whole way.

41:21.244 --> 41:23.010
Then visualize,

What are you feeling bad about?

42:18.469 --> 42:20.200
Huh?

42:20.202 --> 42:22.104
You saw me jump,

42:29.045 --> 42:31.112
- No, that's fine.

42:31.114 --> 42:32.512
Then you can do it. You want it.

My throat is just like...

43:22.498 --> 43:24.164
What happened?

43:24.166 --> 43:27.802
I don't know.
I don't feel it, that's it.

43:27.804 --> 43:30.338
So just leave me alone now,
just go.

43:30.340 --> 43:32.206
You really don't wanna go?

43:32.208 --> 43:33.844
You don't want it?

43:35.244 --> 43:36.947
Look at me. You don't want it?

43:49.025 --> 43:51.092
- It's fine, OK.

50:28.291 --> 50:31.762
Well, you didn't feel it.

50:37.434 --> 50:40.534
[JC] Do you think we need
a little bit of strong liquor?

50:40.536 --> 50:42.239
[Ash] I think you need one.

50:46.876 --> 50:50.211

You think it's funny?
It's beautiful?

- "I feel alive, fucking alive!"
- And what? It is OK.

55:18.681 --> 55:20.646
Not to be like the others
down there.

55:20.648 --> 55:22.648
Not to be like the others
down there.

55:22.650 --> 55:24.550

01:00:22.784 --> 01:00:25.954
The two of us used to slide
down this exact path.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.259
He loved this place.

01:00:33.094 --> 01:00:34.696
[Ash] Chico.

01:00:36.431 --> 01:00:38.934
[JC]
Shall we put him to rest then?

01:00:40.268 --> 01:00:41.501
[Ash] Ready?

01:00:41.503 --> 01:00:43.503
To fly with him again?

01:00:43.505 --> 01:00:47.275
Been a long time.
Been waiting for that.

01:01:09.998 --> 01:01:11.867
Here we are, buddy.

01:01:14.135 --> 01:01:15.737
Me and you.

01:01:16.605 --> 01:01:18.541
Like the good old days.

01:01:24.012 --> 01:01:25.746
We're gonna rage.

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:27.416
We're gonna kick it.

01:01:28.449 --> 01:01:30.352
We're gonna fly right here.

01:01:38.927 --> 01:01:41.128
All right, bro.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.528
[Ash] I love you.

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:46.702
- [JC] <i>Dos cervezas, por favor!</i>
- [chuckles]

01:01:47.702 --> 01:01:50.604
Yeah, Chico!

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:52.542
[air whooshes]

01:02:30.311 --> 01:02:32.714
[cries]

01:02:53.702 --> 01:02:55.802
I gotta tell her.

01:02:55.804 --> 01:02:57.373
[beeps]

01:03:21.929 --> 01:03:23.429
[door opens]

01:03:23.431 --> 01:03:24.833
[Ash] Room service.

01:03:26.168 --> 01:03:28.671
What are you doing
in the room on your own?

01:03:30.172 --> 01:03:31.606
You OK?

01:03:32.641 --> 01:03:34.810
Yeah. Do I look OK?

01:03:35.577 --> 01:03:37.413
- You look good.
- OK.

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.282
I'm not sure.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.086
I need to...

01:03:47.088 --> 01:03:52.092
I want to tell you something,
and I'm not sure how to say.

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:54.730
I'm not sure how to say it.
I'm not sure...

01:04:00.202 --> 01:04:02.501
This is eating me up
on the inside,

01:04:02.503 --> 01:04:04.373
and I have to show you, OK?

01:04:07.943 --> 01:04:09.711
Go for it.

01:04:14.081 --> 01:04:16.282
[Chico] <i>She loves skydiving,</i>

01:04:16.284 --> 01:04:20.220
<i>but she doesn't understand
why I keep base jumping</i>

01:04:20.222 --> 01:04:23.856
<i>and putting my life
in such a risk.</i>

01:04:23.858 --> 01:04:25.825
[JC] <i>Fuck, it's low, huh?</i>

01:04:25.827 --> 01:04:27.728
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Not high.</i>

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.229
[Chico] <i>No.</i>

01:04:29.231 --> 01:04:34.900
<i>I don't know, dude.
That looks fucking sketchy.</i>

01:04:34.902 --> 01:04:38.271
[JC]
<i>No, bro, it's, er... It's good.</i>

01:04:38.273 --> 01:04:43.142
- [Chico] <i>It looks slippy.</i>
- [JC] <i>Hombre, cojones!</i>

01:04:43.144 --> 01:04:45.945
<i>Where are your balls, bro?</i>

01:04:45.947 --> 01:04:47.613
[Chico] <i>OK, love you.</i>

01:04:47.615 --> 01:04:48.748
[JC] <i>Love you, bro.</i>

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:51.251
<i>All right, I'm out. Whoa!</i>

<i>No!</i>

01:05:00.161 --> 01:05:03.697
No. No.

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:06.635
<i>I'm gonna call...
I'm gonna call for help.</i>

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.642
You were there.

01:05:16.644 --> 01:05:18.780
[cries] You were with him.

01:05:40.768 --> 01:05:42.603
I know, I know, it's fine.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.836
Why am I here?

01:05:43.838 --> 01:05:46.141
I can't...
I mean, I can't be here.

01:05:47.242 --> 01:05:49.208
[sobs]

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:50.709
You're supposed to be here.

01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:51.878
I'm not supposed to be here.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.148
Yes, you are supposed
to be here with me.

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:55.481
No.

01:05:55.483 --> 01:05:59.485
I can't go through that again.
What the fuck am I doing here?

01:05:59.487 --> 01:06:01.923
You just gonna end up like him.

01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:06.159
You just... [cries]
You pushed him!

01:06:06.161 --> 01:06:07.661
You fucking pushed him!

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.996
He didn't wanna jump
and he died!

01:06:09.998 --> 01:06:12.132
Now I wanna leave.
You let me leave.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:14.267
I'm gonna fucking jump
out the fucking window.

01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:15.534
You like that, huh?

01:06:15.536 --> 01:06:17.269
You like that, like your dad,
like your dad?

01:06:17.271 --> 01:06:18.639
- Want me to jump?
- Sit down.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.907
Fucking move.
You let me go!

01:06:20.909 --> 01:06:22.041
- No!
- See!

01:06:22.043 --> 01:06:23.142
- No!
- See!

01:06:23.144 --> 01:06:24.378
- No!
- See.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:27.016
Do you fucking get it? No!

01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:30.618
Oh, what the fuck
am I doing here?

01:06:49.036 --> 01:06:50.472
He left.

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.313
Left.

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.318
And it's my fault.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.893
Fuck it.

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.596
Fuck it.

01:07:14.762 --> 01:07:16.531
Fuck it.

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:29.512
[metal creaks]

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:06.882
[draws deep breaths]

01:09:23.457 --> 01:09:24.926
Hey.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.129
Thought you were leaving.

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.899
I thought too.

01:09:32.367 --> 01:09:34.036
Can I have a hug?

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:44.511
I'm so sorry, Ash.

01:09:45.947 --> 01:09:48.149
I'm just glad
he wasn't on his own.

01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:52.421
And for that I thank you.

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:04.365
[JC] <i>Peace.</i>

01:10:06.501 --> 01:10:08.204
<i>Hold on to it.</i>

01:10:13.807 --> 01:10:16.311
<i>But we can't hold on
to anything.</i>

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:18.980
<i>Look around.</i>

01:10:19.847 --> 01:10:21.984
<i>Snow turns to water.</i>

01:10:23.318 --> 01:10:25.287
<i>Water to vapor.</i>

01:10:26.087 --> 01:10:28.056
<i>Vapor to cloud.</i>

01:10:30.425 --> 01:10:32.427
<i>Everything changes.</i>

01:10:51.579 --> 01:10:54.412
Wow, wow, wow.

01:10:54.414 --> 01:10:58.220
A lot of secrets in that
little camera. Huh?

01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:05.426
JC. JC, JC...

01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:09.798
Who are you?

01:11:13.768 --> 01:11:15.871
I never told you but...

01:11:18.006 --> 01:11:19.674
you know when...

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.679
when Chico died?

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:32.321
He came back for me.

01:11:34.689 --> 01:11:36.791
He came back for me and...

01:11:44.832 --> 01:11:47.900
And what we shared...

01:11:47.902 --> 01:11:50.338
is crazy, crazy moments,
you know?

01:11:55.009 --> 01:11:56.912
You helped me remember.

01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:03.118
Remember who I am.

01:12:05.185 --> 01:12:07.055
Remember what I can be.

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:41.553
We'll climb down here
and we're there, babe.

01:12:41.555 --> 01:12:43.157
Uh-huh.

01:13:03.877 --> 01:13:05.443
[distant thud resounds]

01:13:05.445 --> 01:13:07.216
[Ash] Oh.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.119
Wow.

01:13:11.619 --> 01:13:14.055
- Oh.
- It's OK.

01:13:18.159 --> 01:13:19.461
Oh.

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:22.495
OK.

01:13:22.497 --> 01:13:23.899
OK.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.199
OK.

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:27.536
Oh.

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.605
You can do this, babe.

01:13:31.706 --> 01:13:33.307
If you want to.

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.544
Oh...

01:13:37.378 --> 01:13:39.180
Oh, no, fuck.

01:13:39.847 --> 01:13:41.382
Oh.

01:13:55.896 --> 01:13:57.932
[both breathe deeply]

01:14:05.907 --> 01:14:09.278
[JC] You know, babe,
you don't have to do this.

01:14:10.478 --> 01:14:13.181
We can walk back, you know.

01:14:15.582 --> 01:14:17.652
[Ash draws panicky breaths]

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.888
You have nothing to prove here.

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:25.458
I know.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.829
It's my choice.

01:14:29.497 --> 01:14:30.830
You're sure?

01:14:30.832 --> 01:14:33.335
Yeah. I want to do it.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.179
Same as skydiving, huh?

01:14:48.181 --> 01:14:51.483
There's your chute release.
OK, know this.

01:14:51.485 --> 01:14:53.689
Right.

01:14:55.356 --> 01:14:57.024
All right?

01:14:59.694 --> 01:15:01.830
Fuck.

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:08.036
OK.

01:15:10.371 --> 01:15:13.639
Promise me it's gonna be OK.

01:15:13.641 --> 01:15:15.974
[JC] I can't promise that.

01:15:15.976 --> 01:15:17.246
Oh.

01:15:20.314 --> 01:15:21.817
OK.

01:15:24.185 --> 01:15:26.054
Let's do it.

01:15:36.564 --> 01:15:38.032
OK.

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:43.238

- Yeah!

01:16:34.154 --> 01:16:36.625
Yeah, Ash!
