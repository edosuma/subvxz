WEBVTT

00:19.019 --> 00:20.368
We've just received a report

00:20.455 --> 00:21.978
the victim
has been identified

00:22.065 --> 00:24.807
'by the San Francisco locals
as Natalie Gibecki'

00:24.894 --> 00:26.461
although police are
keeping the nature

00:26.548 --> 00:30.378
of her death under wraps
for the moment they were..

00:30.465 --> 00:33.555
Her name's Natalie Gibecki.
27 years old.

00:33.642 --> 00:36.558
Works as a counselor in a youth
probation facility nearby.

00:36.645 --> 00:39.561
The mayor serves on the board,
so we got the call.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.432
Petechial hemorrhaging
in the eyes

00:41.519 --> 00:44.261
and the marks around the neck
indicate that she was strangled.

00:44.348 --> 00:47.308
- Mmm. Where's Lisbon?
- She's with S.F.P.D.

00:47.395 --> 00:48.874
They talked
to the victim's boss.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.920
She was headed
to a movie with friends.

00:51.007 --> 00:52.487
- Not likely.
- Come again?

00:52.574 --> 00:55.011
[Jane]
'Well, she's wearing
a black lace camisole.'

00:55.098 --> 00:58.667
She was planning on changing
her flats to heels.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.408
Her makeup is
freshly applied.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.713
She's wearing a very..

01:01.800 --> 01:03.324
[sniffs]
Very flowery perfume..

01:03.411 --> 01:05.630
'J'adore, if I'm not mistaken.'

01:05.717 --> 01:08.068
She was going
to meet a lover.

01:08.155 --> 01:12.246
Married, I'd guess,
based on the deception.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.291
[cell phone ringing]
Excuse me.

01:14.378 --> 01:17.120
[clears throat]

01:17.207 --> 01:18.426
Hello?

01:18.513 --> 01:20.906
'Hello, Patrick.
It's Erica Flynn.'

01:20.993 --> 01:24.040
Erica Flynn.
Wow, this is a surprise.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.564
Pleasant, I hope.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.958
I bet you're wondering
why I'm calling.

01:29.045 --> 01:31.134
Yeah. Thought crossed my mind.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.397
What if I said
I wanted to hear you?

01:33.484 --> 01:34.877
'I'd say you were lying.'

01:34.964 --> 01:37.053
Not entirely.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.968
Natalie Gibecki..

01:39.055 --> 01:40.839
...I knew her personally.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.885
She was a client
of my matchmaking company.

01:42.972 --> 01:46.323
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

01:46.410 --> 01:49.587
We grew very close
during our sessions together

01:49.674 --> 01:51.676
but then you know
how that can happen.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.374
What do you want, Erica?

01:53.461 --> 01:54.897
Yes, I haven't said,
have I?

01:54.984 --> 01:56.638
'No.'

01:56.725 --> 01:59.162
I'm calling because I can
help you find her killer.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.816
Really? What's his name?

02:00.903 --> 02:03.384
'If you want the answer,
you know where I am.'

02:03.471 --> 02:05.168
It was nice hearing
your voice again.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.387
Yours, too.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.569
- Thank you, Dennis.
- Of course, Ms. Flynn.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.919
[Flynn]
'Helpful as always.'

02:17.006 --> 02:18.877
- Who was that?
- Uh..

02:18.964 --> 02:20.749
That was Erica Flynn.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.794
She wants to help out
with the investigation.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.884
We should fax over
the case file and get her a gun.

02:25.971 --> 02:28.060
Getting her a gun's
a bit much, but

02:28.148 --> 02:30.106
I think
the case file may help.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.281
I was kidding.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.630
[chuckles]
Yeah.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.415
You're kidding, right?

02:38.549 --> 02:39.855
Please tell me
you're kidding.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.336
[theme music]

03:00.005 --> 03:01.485
Hello, Patrick.

03:01.572 --> 03:04.619
Erica. You look good.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.316
Orange suits you.

03:06.403 --> 03:08.840
I suppose I have you
to thank for my wardrobe.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.451
I didn't kill your husband.

03:10.538 --> 03:13.367
Neither did I.
Manslaughter. Big difference.

03:13.454 --> 03:14.933
What is this about?

03:15.020 --> 03:16.718
I know
who killed Natalie Gibecki.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.589
How is that possible?

03:18.676 --> 03:21.201
We grew close
during our sessions together.

03:21.288 --> 03:24.029
Natalie told me things that
she didn't tell anyone else

03:24.116 --> 03:26.684
like the fact that she was
seeing someone in secret.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.948
Why'd she need a dating service
if she was seeing someone?

03:30.035 --> 03:31.733
She met him
during our sessions together.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.343
That must've been
some time ago.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.432
Ten months..

03:35.519 --> 03:38.174
...but Natalie was still
seeing him when she died.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.437
- I'm sure of it.
- How?

03:40.524 --> 03:42.874
I know true love
when I see it.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.528
Then why the secrecy?

03:44.615 --> 03:47.401
The man Natalie was
seeing was married.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.011
She kept the affair
from everyone.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.013
- Everyone except you.
- Yes.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.367
Why are you doing this?

03:57.454 --> 04:00.327
I cared deeply
about Natalie.

04:00.414 --> 04:03.895
Her death is a tragedy, and her
killer should be punished.

04:03.982 --> 04:06.768
That was a nice try.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.944
[whispering]
Alright. I want out of here.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.120
Temporarily, of course.

04:11.207 --> 04:14.166
You have no idea
what this is like, Patrick

04:14.254 --> 04:16.908
living in a cage..

04:16.995 --> 04:18.867
...knowing I'll be
here for years.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.481
The truth is, this may be
my last chance at freedom

04:24.568 --> 04:26.962
while I'm young enough
to enjoy it.

04:27.049 --> 04:31.532
I just want to go to the spa,
eat at my favorite restaurant

04:31.619 --> 04:33.011
a few harmless indulgences

04:33.098 --> 04:35.187
in return for helping you
catch a killer.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.755
What if you're lying?

04:37.842 --> 04:40.932
You once said you could
see right through me.

04:41.019 --> 04:44.022
"Transparent as glass,"
I believe, was how you put it

04:44.109 --> 04:45.981
so tell me,
am I lying now?

04:49.767 --> 04:52.857
[Kimball]
'Natalie Gibecki left
the youth facility at 8:14 p.m.'

04:52.944 --> 04:54.903
A commuter found her at 8:33

04:54.990 --> 04:57.384
giving us a 19-minute window
for the murder.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.081
What do we have for motive?

04:59.168 --> 05:01.605
There's nothing missing from
the body, so robbery seems out.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.433
No sign of sexual assault.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.741
She'd just returned from
a 5-day trip to Puerto Vallarta.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.612
Jane's theory
about a boyfriend?

05:08.699 --> 05:11.223
We looked into it. Friends say
Natalie wasn't seeing anyone.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.008
- Family?
- Only child.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.749
- Parents died years ago.
- Alright.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.012
Head to the youth facility,
talk to the counselors

05:17.099 --> 05:19.580
that were working on her shifts.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.625
Can I skip
this and work the phones?

05:21.712 --> 05:23.584
I have an appointment
in an hour.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.194
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.761
It's just something
I gotta do.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.893
- Sure. Van Pelt?
- Sure. On it.

05:33.942 --> 05:36.901
Hi. I'm Agent Van Pelt.
This is Agent Cho from CBI.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.208
We're here investigating
Natalie Gibecki's murder.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.993
I don't know how we'll tell
the boys. They loved Natalie.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.126
You guys have
any idea who did this?

05:44.213 --> 05:45.823
We're in the
investigation's early stages.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.608
We believe
that Natalie may have been

05:47.695 --> 05:49.174
romantically involved
with someone.

05:49.261 --> 05:52.439
- You know anything about that?
- No.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.745
Yeah, no. I thought
she was single. Hey, Kevin!

05:54.832 --> 05:57.357
'Keep that up, you'll be doing
push-ups until you puke.'

05:57.444 --> 06:00.447
The relationship could have
been with a co-worker.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.492
- Don't look at me.
- You didn't like her?

06:02.579 --> 06:04.755
I didn't say that.
She just wasn't my type.

06:04.842 --> 06:07.410
Kevin! What did I just say?

06:07.497 --> 06:11.153
Now drop
and give me 50. Now!

06:11.240 --> 06:13.460
Know anyone who may
have wanted to harm Natalie?

06:13.547 --> 06:16.506
No, but...we did have
a kid go missing

06:16.593 --> 06:18.029
from the facility
last night.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.118
Trent didn't have
anything to do with this.

06:20.205 --> 06:22.860
- His name was Trent?
- Trent Matthews. He's 17.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.775
Was here for drug possession
and assault.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.386
What time did he go missing?

06:26.473 --> 06:28.692
I saw him at dinner,
so after 7:00.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.434
Like I said, he didn't
have anything to do with this.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.393
We'll need to see his file.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.091
Keep going.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.748
You wanna let her
out of prison?

06:40.835 --> 06:43.054
Well, I just think
Erica could help us.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.143
She knows details
of the victim's life.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.798
- She may even know the killer.
- She says she does.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.452
That she's telling
the truth about.

06:49.539 --> 06:52.063
- Doesn't mean we need her help.
- I didn't say that.

06:52.150 --> 06:56.154
- I said she could be useful.
- What do you think, Luther?

06:56.241 --> 06:57.721
- I'm intrigued.
- Sir.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.201
I think..

06:59.288 --> 07:00.724
...it's just the kinda
innovative thinking

07:00.811 --> 07:02.465
the CBI needs more of.

07:02.552 --> 07:06.034
Using a convict to catch
a killer...it's synergy.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.470
Exactly.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.080
Sir, this isn't even
our jurisdiction.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.431
We couldn't get her
released if we tried.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.171
You're right,
but the warden

07:13.258 --> 07:15.478
at Golden Valley State Prison
has already approved it.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.219
Ms. Flynn's guaranteed
a furlough through

07:17.306 --> 07:19.787
the rehabilitation program
that the governor instituted.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.310
[Luther]
'Apparently,
she's a model inmate.'

07:21.397 --> 07:22.920
She's a convicted murderer.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.575
Convicted manslaughterer,
actually.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.751
- Oh, well, in that case..
- So you agree?

07:27.838 --> 07:30.275
No. She's a dangerous killer,
and she's a flight risk.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.495
Which is why I'll be
assigning two agents

07:32.582 --> 07:34.062
to guard her at all times.

07:34.149 --> 07:37.631
See, Lisbon?
What could possibly go wrong?

07:37.718 --> 07:39.284
[Jane]
'Excuse me.'

07:39.371 --> 07:40.503
Synergy.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.647
[exhales deeply]

07:53.734 --> 07:54.865
[cell phone ringing]

07:57.346 --> 07:59.087
- Hey, Cho.
- Hey.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.784
- What's up?
- You called me.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.133
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.048
I got some background
on Trent Matthews.

08:04.135 --> 08:05.963
He was attending
Sequoia Valley High School

08:06.050 --> 08:08.400
before he was busted
for possession and assault.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.141
It's not far
from the facility.

08:10.228 --> 08:13.405
- Think he might head back?
- He's alone. Family moved.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.017
He's probably looking for
cash and a place to stay.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.584
Might try old friends
for help.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.977
Alright. Van Pelt
and I will get on it.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.979
You ready?
Class is about to start.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.459
Oh, yeah, yeah. All set.

08:25.461 --> 08:28.290
Welcome, mommies and daddies.

08:28.377 --> 08:29.813
My name is Atoosa

08:29.900 --> 08:32.294
and I will be leading
your class today.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.557
Welcome to the first step

08:34.644 --> 08:38.735
in your amazing journey
of parenthood.

08:38.822 --> 08:42.304
Now before we begin,
I would like each of you

08:42.391 --> 08:44.436
to go around the room

08:44.524 --> 08:47.788
and offer something
about yourselves.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.446
Hi.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.535
[chuckles]
Oh.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.406
Would you like to start?

08:57.493 --> 09:01.541
Sure. Um, hi.
My name is Sarah.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.238
Welcome, Sarah.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.674
[laughs]

09:04.761 --> 09:06.720
Oh, hi. I'm Wayne.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.504
Welcome, Wayne.

09:08.591 --> 09:11.725
Um...okay, I'm 28 weeks.

09:11.812 --> 09:14.292
Uh, this is my first child.
Wait. Our first child?

09:14.379 --> 09:15.729
Oh, yeah.
Definitely our first.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.382
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Our first child.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.994
Well, although "our"
might be a little misleading.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.561
Not that
this isn't his baby.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.824
I'm not some kinda
floozy or anything

09:23.911 --> 09:26.304
and, gosh, not that anyone
in this room is..

09:26.391 --> 09:29.699
[Sarah]
No, I, that is,
I just meant, um..

09:29.786 --> 09:31.222
She meant
that we're not married.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.007
That was it,
that we're not married.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.312
No. I mean, yes.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.575
[laughs]

09:40.231 --> 09:41.755
According
to the youth facility

09:41.842 --> 09:43.713
Trent Matthews was
busted for possession

09:43.800 --> 09:45.454
at this high school
three months ago.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.673
[bell ringing]

09:49.197 --> 09:51.416
You know, kids used
to call me "Bracey Gracie"

09:51.503 --> 09:53.984
because I wore braces
until I was 17.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.595
- What did people call you?
- Cho.

10:02.427 --> 10:03.603
That's him.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.563
[indistinct shouting]

10:09.217 --> 10:10.522
- Hey, break it up!
- Hey!

10:10.610 --> 10:12.350
Come on!
Get off, man!

10:12.437 --> 10:13.874
[female #1]
'Oh, yeah!'

10:13.961 --> 10:16.050
- 'Hey, get off, man.'
- Trent Matthews?

10:16.137 --> 10:18.269
- 'What?'
- CBI. We need a word.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.402
Screw your word, man.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.972
[sighs]

10:29.890 --> 10:32.153
You needn't look
so glum, Lisbon.

10:32.240 --> 10:35.112
If anything happens, you're not
gonna be held responsible.

10:35.199 --> 10:38.463
Because that's
what I'm worried about.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.248
[whispering]
You know
why she's doing this.

10:40.335 --> 10:42.206
To try and escape,
most likely.

10:42.293 --> 10:45.906
Yet you're going through
with it anyway.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.430
Are you doing this
because you need Erica's help

10:48.517 --> 10:50.258
or because you want it?

10:50.345 --> 10:52.521
[male #1]
'Agents, you can come in now.'

10:55.916 --> 10:58.483
'You'll have
to sign for custody.'

10:58.570 --> 10:59.702
Thank you.

11:03.227 --> 11:05.882
- Hello, Patrick.
- Erica.

11:05.969 --> 11:09.799
Inmate Erica Marie Flynn
is now in your custody.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.672
- Take good care of her.
- Thanks.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.636
[bell buzzing]

11:22.725 --> 11:25.206
- Alright. Who is he?
- Who?

11:25.293 --> 11:27.643
Natalie's killer.
Don't be cute.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.602
I don't know his name.
It's all in my symphony files.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.953
- Did I not make that clear?
- No, you didn't.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.695
- Must've slipped her mind.
- Where are the files?

11:35.782 --> 11:38.349
My lawyer's having them
sent to your offices now.

11:38.436 --> 11:41.048
Good. Let's get this
over with. You got her?

11:41.135 --> 11:43.485
We got her.
Ms. Flynn, I'm Agent McClay.

11:43.572 --> 11:44.965
This is Agent Morris.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.358
We'll be supervising you
during your furlough.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.926
A friend owns a car company
and has offered me

11:50.013 --> 11:51.623
transportation while I'm out.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.842
How thoughtful.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.760
Patrick, are you coming?

12:09.032 --> 12:10.164
[door closes]

12:13.689 --> 12:14.821
[door opens]

12:16.605 --> 12:17.737
[door closes]

12:20.696 --> 12:21.915
This should be fun.

12:22.002 --> 12:22.916
[sighs]

12:32.099 --> 12:33.230
Here's your tea.

12:33.317 --> 12:34.754
Thanks so much.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.104
- Oh, Ron?
- Yes, Ms. Flynn.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.323
Would you mind getting me
some lemon for that?

12:39.410 --> 12:40.585
Of course.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.417
Hey, boss.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.724
I checked that trip
Natalie took to Puerto Vallarta.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.987
- It seems she traveled alone.
- She meet anybody there?

12:51.074 --> 12:52.206
'I'm not sure.'

12:52.293 --> 12:53.903
We've can't
locate her camera

12:53.990 --> 12:56.688
but Natalie did upload
travel photos on to a web site

12:56.776 --> 12:58.342
I'm having those
printed out now.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.301
- Okay.
- 'Here you go, Ms. Flynn.'

13:02.129 --> 13:03.783
What is it with this woman?

13:03.870 --> 13:06.046
She can get men to do
whatever she wants

13:06.133 --> 13:09.136
and I can't figure out why.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.790
Really?

13:10.877 --> 13:14.271
I get it.
I mean, if I were a guy.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.533
Wow.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.016
[Kimball]
'Assault's
a serious offense, Trent.'

13:20.103 --> 13:21.365
[chuckles]

13:21.452 --> 13:23.019
Man, that dude was a snitch.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.284
That why you were
smashing his face in?

13:27.371 --> 13:30.810
Hell, yeah. He's the reason
why I got sent to juvie.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.290
You ran away from
the facility to get revenge?

13:33.377 --> 13:35.815
No, man.
I left 'cause I had to.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.642
I wasn't about
to get jacked up.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.862
You had a beef
with another kid?

13:39.949 --> 13:43.518
Just one of my counselors,
big dude named Danny.

13:43.605 --> 13:44.824
Danny Vargas?

13:44.911 --> 13:45.955
Yeah.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.653
What happened?

13:48.740 --> 13:52.483
I mean, well, the night
I took off, he, uh..

13:52.570 --> 13:54.921
he and Natalie
were fighting.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.706
I mean, for real,
you know? Um..

13:57.793 --> 14:02.276
She-she was yelling at him like
crazy, man, all up in his face

14:02.363 --> 14:03.799
but, uh, see, Danny..

14:03.886 --> 14:06.628
uh, he's real hard
with us kids.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.544
He, uh,
I mean, he pushes us..

14:09.631 --> 14:12.721
...smacks us around
when no one's looking.

14:12.808 --> 14:15.985
Except this time
Natalie saw it go down.

14:16.072 --> 14:19.032
She wasn't too happy about it,
you know? I mean, the girl..

14:19.119 --> 14:20.947
The girl started
flippin' out on him.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.687
Did things get physical
between them?

14:22.774 --> 14:25.386
Oh, well, it was about to
until I stepped in.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.997
I mean, y-you can't lay
your hands on a woman.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.304
I don't give
a damn who you are.

14:30.391 --> 14:34.047
But, anyway, I mean,
Danny got mad

14:34.134 --> 14:36.963
real mad
so I took off

14:37.050 --> 14:38.747
before he could
do something about it.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.141
You think Danny would have
hurt you in retaliation?

14:41.228 --> 14:42.882
I know he would have.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.579
The dude has
frickin' issues, man.

14:44.666 --> 14:47.887
He-he should be the one
sitting here, not me.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.540
Listen,
with all bull aside

14:49.627 --> 14:52.587
let me tell you
something, alright?

14:52.674 --> 14:56.330
I would never hurt
Natalie, ever.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.201
'I got no reason to.'

14:58.288 --> 15:01.335
I mean, she-she was
one of the only adults

15:01.422 --> 15:04.425
who ever treated me like
a person, you know?

15:04.512 --> 15:05.817
Yeah, I do.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.090
Hey. You okay?

15:17.177 --> 15:19.440
Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

15:19.527 --> 15:22.443
Uh, no.
That video was..

15:22.530 --> 15:24.575
Oh, God. It was horrible.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.274
'I had no idea that
childbirth could be so..'

15:27.361 --> 15:29.798
- Well, so scary.
- Oh, it wasn't that bad.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.408
Sarah, I'm a homicide detective.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.454
I've seen some pretty graphic
things, but that..

15:33.541 --> 15:36.109
...nothing
prepared me for that.

15:36.196 --> 15:40.330
How do you think I feel?
I have to go through it.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.942
Wayne, you're gonna be
okay with this, right?

15:43.029 --> 15:45.335
Yeah, I think so.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.033
- Oh.
- I-I mean, yes. Y-yes.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.209
Alright. Good. Because I..

15:49.296 --> 15:51.080
I can't do this on my own.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.299
I know.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.738
[Erica on TV]
'What kinda man
you looking for?'

15:56.825 --> 15:58.827
[Natalie on TV]
'Well, someone generous..'

15:58.914 --> 16:00.742
'...and caring.'

16:00.829 --> 16:03.832
Someone who puts the needs
of others before themselves.

16:03.919 --> 16:06.748
'I want a man
I can grow old with.'

16:06.835 --> 16:10.230
A best friend.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.622
Problem?

16:11.709 --> 16:13.537
This is so frustrating.

16:13.624 --> 16:16.976
One of Natalie's
interviews is missing.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.282
How unfortunate.

16:19.369 --> 16:22.372
I know what you're thinking,
I had nothing to do with it.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.635
It's not my problem
if your people misplace things.

16:24.722 --> 16:25.897
"My people?"

16:25.985 --> 16:27.812
Alright.
That's enough. Let's go.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.423
- Where?
- Back to prison.

16:29.510 --> 16:32.208
You shouldn't be out
if you can't actually help--

16:32.295 --> 16:33.818
Well, just hang on
a second.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.429
Just 'cause
there's a video missing

16:35.516 --> 16:38.127
doesn't mean she can't help
find Natalie's lover, right?

16:38.214 --> 16:40.912
Absolutely.
It's all right here.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.349
Natalie lived for her work.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.655
She dedicated her life
to helping others.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.222
Her finding love
without my service

16:46.309 --> 16:47.702
can only mean one thing..

16:47.789 --> 16:50.226
...the man she was seeing
was a co-worker.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.141
I tried that. No luck.

16:52.228 --> 16:55.144
That's 'cause she wasn't working
at the facility when they met.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.103
This was ten months ago,
remember?

16:57.190 --> 17:00.410
You mean when she was working
at the nonprofit, Casa Encantar?

17:00.497 --> 17:02.978
Exactly.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.719
- Shall we?
- We shall.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.732
Welcome to Casa Encantar.
Can I help you?

17:17.819 --> 17:21.823
My fiance and I are looking for
a nonprofit to volunteer for.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.346
- Let me show you around.
- Okay.

17:23.433 --> 17:26.697
We're not usually this busy,
but we're throwing

17:26.784 --> 17:28.743
a fund-raising event
tomorrow night.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.875
It's actually
a release party

17:30.962 --> 17:33.574
for a book that
our CEO has written.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.228
Here he is now.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.621
Hi. I'm Greg Relin. Welcome.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.406
It's wonderful,
what you do here.

17:39.493 --> 17:40.711
Thank you.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.583
Since we started,
we've been lucky enough

17:42.670 --> 17:45.716
to build six schools,
four clinics, two orphanages

17:45.803 --> 17:48.980
throughout Mexico,
all in small rural villages

17:49.068 --> 17:50.982
some without electricity
or running water.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.854
- 'Mmm.'
- That's our newest orphanage.

17:52.941 --> 17:55.683
[Greg]
'We hope to have four
more by the year end.'

17:55.770 --> 17:57.685
Ifwe raise enough
support tomorrow night.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.730
So Evan's told you
about our gala?

17:59.817 --> 18:01.515
There'll be plenty
of food and drink

18:01.602 --> 18:02.907
'even some entertainment.'

18:02.994 --> 18:04.518
'You're both
welcome to come.'

18:04.605 --> 18:06.781
See, see what
a difference you can make.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.696
Thank you very much
for the invitation.

18:08.783 --> 18:12.221
Tell me, when did you
last see Natalie Gibecki?

18:12.308 --> 18:14.136
- I'm sorry?
- Don't be.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.225
You said you were
looking to volunteer.

18:16.312 --> 18:19.185
I didn't. She did, she also
said I was her fiance.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.143
- Cheeky.
- And you are who, exactly?

18:21.230 --> 18:23.406
I'm Patrick Jane.
I'm a consultant with the CBI.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.278
I'm investigating
Natalie's murder.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.541
[Jane]
'She was seeing
someone here, yes?'

18:27.628 --> 18:29.064
Not that I know of. Evan?

18:29.151 --> 18:31.327
- No.
- No?

18:31.414 --> 18:35.201
Oh, of course. It's a secret,
so you wouldn't tell me anyway.

18:35.288 --> 18:38.943
Mind if I look around,
talk to some of your employees?

18:39.030 --> 18:40.641
- Mmm...no.
- Thank you very much.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.599
Good luck with the book.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.693
[Patrick]
What about him?

18:49.780 --> 18:52.609
Handsome but dim,
like a golden retriever.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.742
Natalie wouldn't be
interested in someone like that.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.874
Who would she be
interested in?

18:56.961 --> 19:01.575
Someone attractive, witty,
compassionate, 25 to 35

19:01.662 --> 19:04.665
fit, good hair,
and a romantic at heart.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.362
Oh, that's all?

19:06.449 --> 19:09.017
No wonder she enlisted
the help of a professional.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.802
Good ones are out there,
if you know where to look.

19:11.889 --> 19:14.631
Natalie was a college girl.
She read voraciously.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.460
She was inquisitive,
intelligent, and idealistic.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.507
She would need to be
with somebody who was the same.

19:20.594 --> 19:21.769
Him.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.773
You buy me dinner
at my restaurant of choice

19:25.860 --> 19:27.078
if I'm right.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.690
No bet. You're right.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.474
He's the only man
that didn't look.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.041
[Jane]
'I'll spring for dinner'

19:33.128 --> 19:35.783
if you can get him
to confess right now.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.089
Ooh. Bet.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.308
Do your thing.

19:42.964 --> 19:46.315
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.404
Uh, you must be..

19:48.491 --> 19:50.711
Uh, Richard.
Can I help you?

19:50.798 --> 19:53.844
I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?
I can see you're upset.

19:53.931 --> 19:56.151
What? No. No, I..

19:56.238 --> 19:57.761
I'm-I'm fine.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.503
Uh, bad time
for, for what?

20:00.590 --> 20:03.593
[whispering]
It's okay.
Natalie told me all about you.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.726
I'm sorry. Natalie?

20:05.813 --> 20:07.945
You were having
an affair with her.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.599
That's ridiculous.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.035
I'm a married man.

20:11.122 --> 20:14.213
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.997
Natalie was
a dear friend of mine.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.434
Her passing has been
devastating for me.

20:18.521 --> 20:21.785
I can't begin to imagine
how you must feel right now.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.832
There's no greater loss than
the loss of the person you love.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.707
I didn't think
that she told anyone.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.013
This is Richard.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.449
There's this
great place downtown.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.972
Sicilian chef. Mmm.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.845
He does wonders with
fish fresh, simple.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.934
Remarkable.
I'm suddenly hungry.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.544
- Mmm.
- Hi, Richard.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.068
We had an argument,
but it wasn't a big deal.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.984
- You lied. That makes it one.
- Didn't think it was relevant.

20:47.071 --> 20:49.944
Your shift ended at 8:00,
the same time as Natalie's.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.511
Where'd you go after work?

20:51.598 --> 20:54.253
- To dinner with a friend.
- Right afterwards?

20:54.340 --> 20:55.689
Yes, about 8:30.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.299
This friend have a name?

20:57.386 --> 20:59.258
Jim Clark.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.782
You don't think I did
something to her, do you?

21:01.869 --> 21:04.045
This is insane.
I didn't kill Natalie.

21:04.132 --> 21:05.612
What were you two
arguing about?

21:05.699 --> 21:08.136
She disliked the way
I handled one of the kids.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.877
Thought you were
abusing him?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.487
I got in his face

21:11.574 --> 21:13.707
maybe pushed him
a little bit, okay?

21:13.794 --> 21:15.535
That's it. It wasn't abuse.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.928
Natalie came in here all
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

21:18.015 --> 21:19.974
thinking she was gonna
connect with these kids

21:20.061 --> 21:23.064
and it's a great idea,
but it doesn't work.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.892
Sometimes getting physical
is the only thing

21:24.979 --> 21:27.068
these animals respond to,
you understand?

21:27.155 --> 21:28.635
Yeah, you're right.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.593
Abusing kids
is against the law.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.726
Do you understand?

21:32.813 --> 21:34.031
Yeah.

21:34.118 --> 21:35.294
Good.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.653
[Patrick]
'Okay. Thank you. Bye.'

21:46.740 --> 21:48.394
Richard Eldridge will be
speaking with

21:48.481 --> 21:51.788
one of my colleagues
first thing tomorrow morning.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.790
We make a good team,
don't we?

21:53.877 --> 21:55.226
Y-you said you had
a question.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.141
Oh, yes. That.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.927
Would you hate me
if I told you I was lying?

22:00.014 --> 22:01.711
These days,
I don't get to spend

22:01.798 --> 22:03.452
much time alone
with charming men.

22:03.539 --> 22:06.542
Well, there's a reason for that.
So you don't kill them.

22:06.629 --> 22:07.891
We all have our baggage.

22:09.937 --> 22:12.896
I've been thinking about you
a lot over the past few months.

22:12.983 --> 22:15.029
I often wonder
how things would be

22:15.116 --> 22:16.900
had we met under
different circumstances.

22:16.987 --> 22:20.164
Thinking about what might have
been will drive you crazy.

22:20.251 --> 22:23.037
Much better to think about
what will happen in the future.

22:23.124 --> 22:24.343
Erica.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.648
I like you, Patrick.

22:27.824 --> 22:30.479
I hope my directness doesn't
make you uncomfortable.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.133
I know what you're doing.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.700
What am I doing?

22:33.787 --> 22:37.573
Seducing me to conceal
your true purpose..

22:37.660 --> 22:39.009
...which is to escape.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.360
Am I..

22:41.447 --> 22:43.187
...seducing you?

22:43.274 --> 22:44.363
No.

22:46.147 --> 22:47.757
I'm not trying
to escape, Patrick.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.892
In fact, you don't actually
believe I am.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.328
No?

22:53.415 --> 22:55.548
No.

22:55.635 --> 23:00.944
Those agents outside the door
aren't to keep me from escaping.

23:01.031 --> 23:04.644
They're to keep you
and I apart.

23:04.731 --> 23:08.038
I know you have feelings
for me.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.214
This whole escape nonsense
is just your way

23:10.301 --> 23:11.868
of avoiding those feelings.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.522
No, actually
I'm fairly concerned

23:13.609 --> 23:15.394
you might try to escape.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.961
Then ask yourself this.

23:18.048 --> 23:20.224
If those agents weren't
outside the door right now

23:20.311 --> 23:21.748
what would you do?

23:25.012 --> 23:26.230
What will you do?

23:31.279 --> 23:33.673
[intense music]

23:51.604 --> 23:53.997
[instrumental music]

24:13.190 --> 24:15.541
[indistinct chattering]

24:27.466 --> 24:29.032
[Jane]
'What are these?'

24:29.119 --> 24:30.817
Pictures Natalie Gibecki
took when she was

24:30.904 --> 24:32.601
on vacation
in Puerto Vallarta.

24:32.688 --> 24:36.170
I was checking to see if she met
anyone when she was down there.

24:36.257 --> 24:37.998
- Did she?
- Doesn't look like it.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.441
I guess I was done
with those.

24:53.056 --> 24:57.017
Natalie and I s-started seeing
each other about a year ago.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.846
You were having an affair.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.196
Yes.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.503
But I wasn't just
stringing her along.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.375
I planned to leave my wife,
it's just..

25:07.462 --> 25:10.813
[sighs]
You know, it's complicated.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.511
Uh, complicated?

25:12.598 --> 25:15.035
Because your wife's family
has millions of dollars

25:15.122 --> 25:17.124
and you make minimum wage
at a nonprofit?

25:19.779 --> 25:22.259
'What did Natalie think
about your being married?'

25:22.346 --> 25:26.525
[sighs]
She was patient at first.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.962
She knew that I was unhappy.

25:29.049 --> 25:31.225
Recently, she got tired
of waiting.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.922
So she broke things off.

25:33.009 --> 25:36.535
- When was that?
- Two weeks ago.

25:36.622 --> 25:39.320
We hardly spoke during
the entire time. I called her.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.365
I asked her to see me.
She wouldn't.

25:41.452 --> 25:45.718
She said she needed to get away.
Clear her head.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.459
And is that why she went
to Puerto Vallarta?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.766
Yes.

25:50.853 --> 25:55.031
I just assumed that
that was the end.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.556
Then a few days ago,
she called.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.514
She wanted to see me.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.473
She was going to meet you
the night she was killed?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.563
Yes.

26:04.650 --> 26:08.436
9 o'clock. The same little bar
we always go to.

26:08.523 --> 26:11.178
I waited an hour.

26:11.265 --> 26:14.268
When she didn't show,
I just..

26:14.355 --> 26:16.096
I assumed that
she changed her mind.

26:19.534 --> 26:22.319
I-I know that, that you're just,
you're doing your job

26:22.406 --> 26:24.060
Agent Lisbon.

26:26.759 --> 26:31.459
I wouldneverdo this
to Natalie.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.983
I couldn't.

26:34.070 --> 26:37.160
Natalie was going to meet you
the night she was killed.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.554
A married man she was
romantically involved with

26:39.641 --> 26:42.644
who doesn't have an alibi
for the night of her murder.

26:42.731 --> 26:44.603
You'll forgive me
if I'm a little skeptical.

26:49.346 --> 26:51.000
[Van Pelt]
'What about the boyfriend?'

26:51.087 --> 26:53.612
He was gonna meet Natalie
the night she was killed.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.744
Here's the place's name.
Talk to the bartender.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.181
See if anybody remembers
seeing him.

26:58.268 --> 27:01.184
Where's Erica?
Getting a mani-pedi?

27:01.271 --> 27:03.056
- How do you know?
- Alright.

27:03.143 --> 27:05.232
This is getting ridiculous.
Erica's served her purpose.

27:05.319 --> 27:07.016
Time to bring her
back to prison.

27:07.103 --> 27:09.715
- Oh, we can't do that.
- Why not?

27:09.802 --> 27:10.846
I need her.

27:25.034 --> 27:27.428
[indistinct chattering]

27:29.386 --> 27:31.606
Mr. Jane, Miss Flynn.
How nice to see you.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.521
You are here as guests?

27:33.608 --> 27:35.915
Uh, well, not,
not exactly.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.917
I hope there's not
some problem.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.396
Mr. Relin didn't tell you?

27:39.483 --> 27:41.355
Tell me what?

27:41.442 --> 27:43.052
Erica and I
are performing tonight.

27:43.139 --> 27:45.054
Just a little something
we've been working on.

27:45.141 --> 27:46.403
It's all been arranged.

27:46.490 --> 27:49.232
Um, how fantastic.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.799
Well, let's hope.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.415
[guests applauding]

27:59.765 --> 28:01.375
[Jane]
Thank you.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.724
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:02.811 --> 28:05.031
My name is Patrick Jane.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.120
For tonight
and for a very good cause

28:07.207 --> 28:11.428
let's all imagine that
this, uh, tawdry hotel ballroom

28:11.515 --> 28:15.606
is, in fact,
the Casa Encantar.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.479
The enchanted house.

28:18.566 --> 28:21.351
Ladies and gentlemen,
my lovely assistant, Erica.

28:21.438 --> 28:22.831
[guests applauding]

28:22.918 --> 28:25.616
Erica and I
will conjure up spirits

28:25.704 --> 28:27.793
that will awe and amaze you.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.230
And then we will turn
that awed amazement

28:30.317 --> 28:34.800
into cold, hard cash that will
help feed, clothe and educate

28:34.887 --> 28:36.932
'thousands of homeless orphans.'

28:37.019 --> 28:38.107
[guests applauding]

28:40.327 --> 28:42.721
'As you can see,
Erica has..'

28:42.808 --> 28:45.593
...set the stage
with four boxes.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.813
Now in order for this
performance to work

28:47.900 --> 28:50.772
we need four willing volunteers.

28:50.859 --> 28:53.862
Once you're chosen, please make
your way promptly to the stage.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.212
Don't be shy. This shouldn't
hurt one little bit.

28:56.299 --> 28:57.605
[indistinct chattering]

28:59.868 --> 29:01.565
A quick hand
for these brave souls.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.524
[guests applauding]

29:03.611 --> 29:07.484
Thank you, Erica.
Looking fetching in green.

29:07.571 --> 29:11.227
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
please pay close attention.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.099
You're about to witness
something

29:13.186 --> 29:16.232
that I can pretty much guarantee
you've never seen before.

29:16.319 --> 29:17.843
[guests applauding]

29:21.760 --> 29:24.588
You will see something clouded
in the unknown

29:24.675 --> 29:27.678
in a world of clairvoyants
and divination.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.463
A world of spirits.

29:29.550 --> 29:32.727
Now I know some of you don't
believe that spirits exist.

29:32.814 --> 29:37.340
But trust me when I tell you
they are very real.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.865
They're here in this room
right now speaking to me

29:39.952 --> 29:42.128
just as I am speaking to you.

29:42.215 --> 29:45.435
And they're telling me that
one of these individuals here

29:45.522 --> 29:47.786
'is harboring a deep,
dark secret.'

29:49.962 --> 29:52.486
Huh? Don't believe me?

29:52.573 --> 29:56.142
Fantastic. That gives me
the chance to prove it to you.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.753
You, sir.
What's your name?

30:00.668 --> 30:04.150
- Richard.
- Richard, are you here alone?

30:04.237 --> 30:05.325
- Yes.
- Thank you.

30:05.412 --> 30:07.327
Would you step forward?

30:07.414 --> 30:09.285
Inside one of these boxes

30:09.372 --> 30:11.940
is an item that holds
great significance to you.

30:12.027 --> 30:14.900
I don't know which box it's in,
and neither do you.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.902
Am I correct?

30:16.989 --> 30:17.990
- Correct.
- Alright, Richard.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.687
I need you to concentrate now.

30:19.774 --> 30:23.473
Concentrate and clear your mind
of any distractions.

30:23.560 --> 30:27.086
I would like you to choose
two boxes.

30:27.173 --> 30:30.872
Two boxes, either on the left
side or the right side.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.091
Please.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.311
Erica.

30:38.227 --> 30:39.315
'There's two boxes left.'

30:39.402 --> 30:41.187
I'd like you
to choose one, Richard.

30:49.064 --> 30:53.503
Now you made your choice only
with the spirits as your guide?

30:53.590 --> 30:55.027
Yes.

30:55.114 --> 30:57.116
Erica, if you would open
the box, please.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.125
Does this necklace mean
anything to you, Richard?

31:09.737 --> 31:11.173
Yes.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.001
Tell the audience
what it means, Richard.

31:15.569 --> 31:16.875
[crying]

31:19.007 --> 31:22.445
It's the necklace
that I gave to Natalie.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.491
[Jane]
'Why did you give it to her?'

31:27.886 --> 31:32.020
It was a symbol
of my deep and abiding..

31:32.107 --> 31:33.326
...love..

31:33.413 --> 31:34.718
[crying]
...for her.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.459
[Jane]
'It's okay.'

31:36.546 --> 31:38.157
It's okay.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.636
[guests applauding]

31:39.723 --> 31:41.247
'Thank you, Richard.'

31:41.334 --> 31:44.032
If you'll make your way back
to your seat, that's okay.

31:44.119 --> 31:47.862
Wait! The spirits are sending me
another message.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.778
They're telling me that
someone else on this stage

31:50.865 --> 31:52.258
has a secret.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.174
Mr. Relin.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.132
[guests applauding]

31:57.219 --> 31:59.526
A crowd favorite.

31:59.613 --> 32:02.355
You're harboring a deep,
dark secret, aren't you?

32:02.442 --> 32:04.487
I don't think so.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.402
Oh, really?

32:06.489 --> 32:09.884
Well, let's check, shall we?
Step forward, please.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.973
Clear your mind
and choose two boxes.

32:16.412 --> 32:17.631
Erica.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.896
Now you know the drill.
One box.

32:27.728 --> 32:30.165
Thank you.

32:30.252 --> 32:34.126
Now you chose this box
of your own free will, yes?

32:34.213 --> 32:35.301
I guess so.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.303
Erica, please do the honors.

32:37.390 --> 32:38.608
Open the box.

32:41.481 --> 32:45.572
Is this photograph
of any significance to you?

32:45.659 --> 32:47.922
- No.
- Are you certain?

32:48.009 --> 32:50.533
Well, perhaps
if you saw it bigger.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.753
Erica?

32:52.840 --> 32:55.016
Now do you recognize it?

32:55.103 --> 32:58.846
It looks like the site you claim
to have built an orphanage on.

32:58.933 --> 33:01.414
'Only there's no orphanage.'

33:01.501 --> 33:03.633
I don't, I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.679
What about now?

33:05.766 --> 33:08.247
'It's a photo taken a week ago.'

33:08.334 --> 33:09.596
[guests murmuring]

33:09.683 --> 33:11.859
'There is no orphanage, Greg.'

33:11.946 --> 33:14.993
Only a doctored photograph
you've been passing off as real.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.865
Everything you've said
you've done is a lie, Greg.

33:17.952 --> 33:20.476
- You don't understand.
- Oh, but I thinktheydo.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.957
[indistinct chattering]

33:25.046 --> 33:27.875
You're under arrest.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.964
Let's go.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.880
Uh, thank you.
You've been a lovely audience.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.969
Thank you and goodnight.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.450
[guests shouting]

33:42.281 --> 33:45.240
[Lisbon]
'You embezzled millions
of dollars meant for charity'

33:45.327 --> 33:48.765
and siphoned the money
into your own pockets.

33:48.852 --> 33:51.072
You had everybody fooled
until Natalie took that

33:51.159 --> 33:52.378
trip to Mexico.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.818
Natalie called me.

33:57.905 --> 34:00.951
Said she needed to speak with me
about something important.

34:01.039 --> 34:04.825
So I met her after work
at the subway station.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.218
I offered her a ride.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.441
She told me she had visited

34:12.528 --> 34:14.661
one of the orphanages
that we built.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.358
And she accused you
of lying.

34:16.445 --> 34:17.533
No.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.102
Not at first.
She trusted me.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.847
She wanted an explanation.

34:26.934 --> 34:29.371
But..

34:29.458 --> 34:31.417
...I didn't have one.
What could I say?

34:31.504 --> 34:32.896
She had the photos.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.252
My whole world was threatened.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.036
Everything I had built
would be gone.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.517
[dramatic music]

34:56.137 --> 34:57.182
[sighing]

34:58.922 --> 35:00.881
Okay, I'm coming, Wayne.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.274
- In here.
- Ah!

35:02.361 --> 35:04.537
What is going on with you?

35:04.624 --> 35:05.799
[whispering]
Take a seat.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.498
[sighing]

35:13.372 --> 35:15.156
- Sarah, I, uh..
- Oh!

35:15.243 --> 35:17.941
There's something
I have to say to you.

35:18.028 --> 35:20.988
So I've been thinking a lot
about us these last few days

35:21.075 --> 35:22.642
and, uh..

35:22.729 --> 35:24.861
- ...our situation.
- Our situation?

35:24.948 --> 35:26.211
Yeah.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.255
- Oh!
- And, uh...

35:27.342 --> 35:28.778
...I want it to change.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.041
Are you breaking up
with me?

35:31.129 --> 35:32.217
The opposite.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.789
Will you marry me?

35:39.876 --> 35:42.314
Ah!

35:42.401 --> 35:44.751
- Oh, no.
- No?

35:44.838 --> 35:46.535
I don't wanna get married
like this.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.320
Like what?

35:48.407 --> 35:50.844
I don't want you to propose me
because I'm pregnant.

35:50.931 --> 35:54.978
It's, it's, it's so not fair
to you or to me.

35:55.065 --> 35:58.156
[sighs]
I don't wanna live
the rest of my life

35:58.243 --> 36:01.420
constantly wondering
whether my husband loves me.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.900
Oh!

36:03.987 --> 36:07.991
Wayne, gosh,
you are...you are a great man.

36:08.078 --> 36:12.605
No, and you are going to be
the most amazing father.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.390
[laughing]
Really.

36:15.477 --> 36:18.176
But, gosh, we are
just not ready for this.

36:39.501 --> 36:40.633
[sighs]

36:44.637 --> 36:46.769
Thank you, Patrick.

36:46.856 --> 36:50.599
You have no idea
how much this meant to me.

36:50.686 --> 36:54.647
You know, you didn't have
to leave the other night.

36:54.734 --> 36:57.476
We can't have
everything we want.

36:57.563 --> 36:58.912
Since when?

37:01.523 --> 37:03.221
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go

37:03.308 --> 37:04.787
freshen up
before the car ride.

37:04.874 --> 37:07.703
Don't bother.
I know about your lawyer.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.444
Lawyer? What lawyer?

37:12.317 --> 37:14.057
'We found him a block away'

37:14.144 --> 37:16.930
with two suitcases, cash
and a forged passport.

37:18.845 --> 37:20.412
[male #1]
'I'm sorry, Erica.'

37:20.499 --> 37:22.327
I love you.

37:22.414 --> 37:23.371
I'll wait for you.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.372
Touching.

37:27.767 --> 37:29.116
So it's over.

37:29.203 --> 37:32.728
[sighing]
You can't blame a girl
for trying.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.426
I'd expect nothing less.

37:38.430 --> 37:42.216
[sighs]
It was nice to see you,
Patrick.

37:42.303 --> 37:43.478
I had a lovely time.

37:45.785 --> 37:46.829
Me, too.

37:49.876 --> 37:51.617
Goodbye.

37:51.704 --> 37:55.490
Well, when you say it like that,
it makes it sound like forever.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.100
Just 15 to 20.

38:01.801 --> 38:04.107
- Just sign here?
- Yes, sir. Bottom of the page.

38:09.939 --> 38:11.245
Time to go, ma'am.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.420
Of course.

38:15.249 --> 38:17.643
[instrumental music]

38:52.939 --> 38:55.637
[Wainright]
'Glad that all worked out.'

38:55.724 --> 38:56.682
Yeah.

39:03.819 --> 39:05.560
Special Agent,
Luther Wainright?

39:05.647 --> 39:07.214
'I'm Officer Hopkins'

39:07.301 --> 39:09.695
from Golden Valley State
Correctional Institution.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.480
We're here to take custody
of Erica Flynn.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.874
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
I just signed custody.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.399
[Hopkins]
'Sir?'

39:31.673 --> 39:33.980
The US Marshals are helping
with the search.

39:34.067 --> 39:37.505
She's been flagged on the flight
lists and all border crossings.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.551
You're wasting your time.

39:39.638 --> 39:40.769
Thanks for your optimism.

39:45.034 --> 39:47.472
I have to ask, Jane.

39:47.559 --> 39:49.865
Did you know
Erica was gonna do this?

39:49.952 --> 39:51.606
Try to escape?

39:51.693 --> 39:55.305
Of course.
I mean, who wouldn't?

39:55.393 --> 39:58.308
You didn't answer my question.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.615
No, I didn't..

40:00.702 --> 40:02.095
...answer your question.

40:05.054 --> 40:07.013
[thundering]

40:11.321 --> 40:13.541
[phone ringing]

40:16.109 --> 40:17.284
[clears throat]

40:20.461 --> 40:22.332
- Hello?
- 'Hello, Patrick.'

40:22.420 --> 40:25.118
[Erica]
'I wanted to thank you
for dinner the other night.'

40:25.205 --> 40:27.903
It was the best date
I've had in years.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.818
It wasn't a date.

40:29.905 --> 40:31.646
If you say so.

40:31.733 --> 40:34.170
- 'Where are you?'
- Someplace warm.

40:34.257 --> 40:36.521
Why? Do you miss me?

40:36.608 --> 40:39.828
[chuckles]
Something like that.

40:39.915 --> 40:42.918
You know, Patrick,
we'd have been good together.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.442
Wouldbe good together.

40:44.529 --> 40:45.878
I will find you.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.315
It's only a matter of time.

40:48.402 --> 40:49.708
Oh, Patrick.

40:49.795 --> 40:51.318
I'm almost looking forward
to it.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.981
[instrumental music]

41:18.867 --> 41:20.521
[theme music]
