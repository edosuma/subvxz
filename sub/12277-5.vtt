WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:04.042
Thank you.

00:06.465 --> 00:07.500
Morning, Sheriff.
Morning.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.834
Maple bar
and Vinspresso to go?

00:09.009 --> 00:11.216
Am I that predictable?
I would say consistent.

00:11.386 --> 00:14.173
Mmm.
Oh. Don't they look happy?

00:17.351 --> 00:18.716
Hey, Zane.
Carter.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.643
That's nice.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.606
So, you're back together.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.684
We're working on it.
Congratulations.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.853
Maybe now,
he'll stop giving me
the stink eye.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.319
Uh, well, he's still having
some issues with our, um,
matrix relationship.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.029
Yeah, so is Allison.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.943
I mean, like that would
ever happen in the
real world. Right?

00:38.121 --> 00:40.373
I know. Right?
(LAUGHING)

00:40.541 --> 00:42.247
(SIGHS)

00:42.793 --> 00:43.953
Okay. So, um...

00:44.127 --> 00:45.628
I've got to head
back to G.D.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.206
Uh, Warren Hughes
is coming from D.O.D.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.291
Human Resources.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.664
Oh. I love that
little guy.
Say hi for me.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.218
Oh, you can
tell him yourself.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.377
He's conducting reviews
of all the Astraeus
crew members

00:54.555 --> 00:56.967
to ensure they're fit
to return to work at G.D.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.549
And the fun never stops.
Yeah.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.598
So, you and |, we're,
uh... We're good, right?

01:04.565 --> 01:05.554
Yeah.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.146
No more weirdness?

01:08.527 --> 01:09.516
No.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.571
Good.
(CHUCKLES)

01:13.991 --> 01:15.231
That was weird.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.403
Here you go, Sheriff.
Hey.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.320
Oh, and looks like Zane
forgot his sunglasses.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.577
Oh. I'll give them to him.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.036
The... Wow.
Nice shades, Ponch.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.250
Jackass.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.791
Who gave you the authority
to re-activate the matrix
mainframe?

01:33.969 --> 01:35.379
Shut it down.
WOMAN: Yes, Director.

01:35.554 --> 01:39.888
I want this thing dismantled
and locked in the vault.
D.O.D. orders.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.138
Fargo, hang on.

01:41.602 --> 01:45.436
I did. ljust began restoring
the corrupted files
to analyze the program code.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.643
Yeah, but that program
killed Dr. Marten.
I want it mothballed.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.687
Yeah, I get that, man.

01:50.861 --> 01:51.816
We all miss her.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.353
But maybe understanding
what happened would give you,

01:54.531 --> 01:56.522
I don't know,
some sense of closure.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.611
Isn't that what Holly
would want?

01:59.453 --> 02:02.445
Holly's gone. And I want
that thing gone. Today.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.405
Come on.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.514
ALLISON: Make sure
the crew's medical files
are ready for review.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.185
Okay, Dr. Blake.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.016
Zia/37:33

02:26.188 --> 02:27.553
I don't think I'm going
to make lunch today.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.188
Oh. Oh, yeah. Jo told me,
uh, Warren's in town.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.817
Yes. And everything
must go smoothly.
People's jobs rely on it.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.363
Okay. So, no pressure, then.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.818
(CHUCKLES) ljust want
to get through this and get
everything back to normal.

02:38.992 --> 02:39.981
Yeah.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.242
So, you were with Jo today?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.950
Uh, actually,
she was with Zane.
And is with Zane.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.330
Because we're
in the real world.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.332
No, but I might have to
talk to her from time to time.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.626
Of course, you will.
Uh-huh.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.962
Hey! My favorite couple!

02:54.132 --> 02:55.713
Oh!
Oh, Warren!

02:55.884 --> 02:56.794
Oh! Well...

02:56.968 --> 02:58.174
(ALL LAUGHING)

02:58.345 --> 03:00.506
Oh. I heard about your ordeal.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.548
Terrible loss, Dr. Marten.
I'm very sorry.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.512
Thank you. It was, uh...
It was a shock to all of us.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.643
Well, I don't want to add
to your stress.

03:09.106 --> 03:12.189
I'll keep these evaluations
as casual as possible.

03:12.693 --> 03:16.561
Think recreation therapy,
not inquisition.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.113
Good.
Well, I think the Astraeus
crew will appreciate that.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.487
Hey, I'm breezy.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.526
But in case
things don't go well,

03:24.705 --> 03:27.117
Sheriff, I'll need you to
handle the redactions.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.497
That doesn't sound breezy.
Do...

03:30.377 --> 03:32.242
Well. Let's get started.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.038
Good luck.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.552
Warren, this is Dr. Fowler,
the Astraeus crew's
particle physicist.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.713
(SIGHS)
Thank you for seeing me
first, Mr. Hughes.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.879
| get test anxiety.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.673
No need, Dr. Fowler.

03:46.852 --> 03:50.970
You must be glad
to be getting back to
normal life after your ordeal.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.434
Definitely. Uh, I'm getting
used to reality again,

03:53.608 --> 03:56.736
and l was able to apply
one of my virtual
breakthroughs to my work here.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.235
Take a look.
(GRUNTING)

03:59.406 --> 04:01.818
Ooh. Steak. This is going
to be a good experiment.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.449
I calculated the wave
functions necessary to

04:04.619 --> 04:08.862
transport organic material
across space-time using
quantum entanglement.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.751
Uh, safety goggles, please.

04:12.711 --> 04:13.575
Oh.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.415
Okay...

04:15.964 --> 04:16.714
Here we go.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.298
Wow.

04:24.473 --> 04:25.337
Very impressive.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.221
Yeah, but who'd
want to eat it now?

04:27.392 --> 04:29.383
I mean, you don't know
where it's been.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.394
How does the reconstructed
tissue compare to the
original?

04:32.856 --> 04:36.565
Darn near identical.
I'm still working out
a few minor issues.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.896
Oh. Look out. Look out.
Look out. Look out. Look out.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.269
Oh. Sheriff.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.279
Are you all right?
(GROANS)

04:44.034 --> 04:45.615
I'll never eat burgers again.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.698
I don't know what happened.
All the other tests
went perfectly.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.237
Can I get a towel?

04:50.415 --> 04:52.246
Clean it up and
run a diagnostic.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.623
Dr. Fargo.

04:55.295 --> 04:59.459
Clearly, Dr. Fowler
rushed his work
in order to impress me,

04:59.633 --> 05:02.215
work he developed,
when he was jacked
into the program.

05:02.385 --> 05:06.298
Well, yes...
This accident was a direct
result of his trauma.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.681
So, he's redacted
pending further
evaluation.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.258
Redacted?

05:11.436 --> 05:12.812
I'm very sorry.

05:12.979 --> 05:17.222
Now, Dr. Fargo,
l have something special
planned for your review.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.401
I think I'm deaf.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.025
This is my evaluation?

05:29.162 --> 05:34.031
Yes. I've found that
recreation therapy helps
people to relax and open up.

05:34.543 --> 05:38.001
And your file says
that laser tag
is a favorite activity.

05:38.171 --> 05:42.665
Well, I did captain the Eureka
team that schooled Los Alamos
three years running.

05:42.843 --> 05:47.303
Excellent.
Shall we start then?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.842
Bring it.

05:50.016 --> 05:53.008
I told you I needed things
to go smoothly today.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.347
Hey, I didn't asplode
the tenderloin.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.978
And man, what a waste!

05:57.858 --> 06:00.520
Well, your eardrums
aren't ruptured.
I think you'll be fine.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.855
Well, except I was going to
enjoy my day with you.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.988
And now, I'm stuck with Jo,
doing... redactions.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.155
Well, maybe I'll have to
keep you under observation
for a little longer.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.945
You know,
just to be on the safe side.
Right. Right.

06:14.958 --> 06:15.947
Is this where it hurts?

No. Where's Warren?

He's doing Fargo's
evaluation. Why?

07:41.962 --> 07:42.997
I'm Fargo.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.958
Okay, you know what?
That asplosion was
bigger than we thought.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.544
We need to
check your head.
No time. I need to find me!

07:48.718 --> 07:49.628
Jack. Jack!

07:49.803 --> 07:52.385
I heard gunfire.
What the hell happened?

07:52.555 --> 07:54.216
I don't know.
Jack just lost it.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.889
Carter did this?
Yes.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.472
Okay, I have to find him.
No, no, no, no.
Look. He left the gun here.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.012
He needs medical attention.
I will handle it.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.435
No weirdness.
Yeah. Right.

as ready to lead

going on with you?

Well, for starters,
I'm over here.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.653
Okay, Fargo, it's not funny.
Jack just fired a weapon
in the infirmary.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.866
(STAMMERING)
I did what?

09:43.333 --> 09:46.917
It was an accident.
I was in here, in my body,
playing laser tag.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.918
The next thing I know,
I'm in you.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.752
Okay. (GRUNTING)
Never phrase it
that way again.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.712
What are you two
talking about?

09:56.888 --> 09:58.753
We've had
a kind of neural swap.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.927
That is impossible.
Possible.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.684
We were just making out
in the infirmary.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.094
With Warren here?

10:06.272 --> 10:08.649
Dr. Blake, PDA
in the workplace
is against G.D. policy.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.432
Bigger issues, Fargo.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.191
Oh, my God.
You're not kidding.

10:12.654 --> 10:16.272
Is this myjoking face?
No. This is not
my face at all.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.116
What did you brainiacs
do this time?

10:20.286 --> 10:23.653
I don't know.
But if Warren finds out,
we can kiss ourjobs goodbye.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.198
Oh. Um...
Hey, kids.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.166
Time for phase two,
Dr. Fargo.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.043
Let's go look at some art.

10:32.132 --> 10:32.996
Help me, Allie.

10:40.932 --> 10:44.675
Wait. You're Fargo?
I'm sorry. I'm having
trouble believing this.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.269
Just run a
magnetoencephalographic
neural scan and find out.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.144
See?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.231
Wow. I mean, that is
definitely not Jack.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.235
But neural transplantation
is impossible.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.566
What about neural
teleportation?

10:57.740 --> 10:58.729
Neural what?

10:58.908 --> 11:01.570
Dr. Fowler's
matter-relocation unit blew up
in our faces this morning.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.530
Maybe it affected
our synaptic functioning.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.661
He said
it was having issues.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.282
Maybe. It's a stretch.
I don't know.
I'll take a look.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.916
And we'll start running
neural scans.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.499
Hopefully, we can fix this
before Warren finds out.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.881
Just hurry up. Carter's
in my body talking to Warren.

What an oddly child-like
imagination you have.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.844
Uh... How about this one?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.107
Butterfly cow.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.478
(CLEARING THROAT)

11:38.656 --> 11:41.819
(STAMMERING)
That is filthy.
You show that to children?

11:43.369 --> 11:47.863
I have to say,
I'm a little
concerned, Dr. Fargo.

11:48.041 --> 11:52.751
These aren't typical
answers for someone
with an IQ. of 163.

11:52.921 --> 11:58.257
Ah. Well, because
I was joking. Obviously.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.341
Give me another one.
I can do better.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.922
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

12:03.097 --> 12:06.760
Fargo, about that project
we discussed
shutting down earlier...

12:06.935 --> 12:07.970
I found something
promising.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.223
Yes. Well...

12:12.398 --> 12:15.390
Pursue that
and report back to me.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.771
Great. Thanks.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.358
And I'll see you tomorrow,
Mr. Donovan.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.776
Yeah, I can't wait, Warren.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.734
So, let's try
a few more images.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.784
Accepted to MIT
as a sophomore.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.034
Got my PhD at 22.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.328
Recruited by Global Dynamics
the next year.

12:37.507 --> 12:41.375
And now my entire
scientific career is at
the mercy of Sheriff Carter.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.589
I'm more concerned that
his body is at your mercy.

12:45.807 --> 12:46.967
What if he gets
stuck this way?

12:48.559 --> 12:49.935
Wow, Dr. Blake.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.227
Either you'll have to
date me in
Sheriff Carter's body,

12:53.398 --> 12:55.684
or date Sheriff Carter
in mine.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.518
It's quite a
Sophie's choice.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.986
Grace? We have to fix this.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.109
Honey, don't worry,
I will take care of it.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.901
(MACHINE BEEPING)
Oh. We're getting
a neural spike.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.244
Is he having a seizure?
Fargo?

13:15.586 --> 13:16.746
Dr. Fargo?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.165
What? Hmm?

13:18.339 --> 13:21.251
What do you
see in these?

13:21.884 --> 13:23.499
(STAMMERING)
The Orion Nebula.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.674
A high elf with
a war hammer.

high-fiving herself.

13:30.852 --> 13:31.932
(LAUGHING)

13:32.270 --> 13:36.639
You have a very
interesting brain,
Dr. Fargo.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.935
I think we're done.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.688
Done? As in redacted?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.274
No. Done,
as in cleared for duty.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.531
I'm satisfied
that you're ready.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.192

14:03.301 --> 14:04.791
Oh.
Jack?

14:06.429 --> 14:09.762
Yeah. Oh, I've literally
never been so happy.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.594
My God. I don't think
I could have taken
Sophie's choice.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.348
She's been a little worried.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.775
ALLISON: Maybe
the neural scanning
process reset you somehow.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.603
Grace is analyzing the data.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.109
But we don't know
what caused it.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.988
What about the, uh...
Transporter thing...
Thing-ama-jig?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.107
Did you make me
talk like that
in front of Warren?

14:29.744 --> 14:31.405
Yeah, I did.
You want to go
shoot something?

14:31.579 --> 14:32.489
(HENRY CHUCKLING)

14:33.206 --> 14:36.664
I've looked at the
matter re-locator.
And there's no indication

14:36.834 --> 14:40.167
that it could cause this.
Any residual symptoms?

14:41.631 --> 14:43.963
Uh... My head hurts a bit,

14:44.133 --> 14:45.634
but I'm pretty relieved
to be back in my body.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.589
(SCOFFS) Yeah, me too.
You really had to go
to the little boys' room.

(CHUCKLES)

your boy hands to...

14:57.230 --> 14:58.845
They were your hands.
(HENRY CHUCKLING)

14:59.023 --> 15:00.934
Both of you need
some rest tonight.

15:01.109 --> 15:02.895
And we'll keep
looking for the cause.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.526
But hopefully, you know,
the worst is over.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.564
Hopefully.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.255
How you feeling?

15:28.803 --> 15:30.213
Well, I'm back to my old self.

there be a problem?

why do you sound like me?

Because I am you.

who are you talking to?

you're a dead man.

nuts with the hair trimmer,

in man-scaping.

at the neural lab.

both ways, pal.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.104
Ew. The birth control thing?

24:02.274 --> 24:04.981
No. An Implantable
Cardioverter Defibrillator.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.983
It delivers a jolt of
electricity to correct

24:07.154 --> 24:09.190
arrhythmia during
stressful situations.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.481
Yeah, like being chased by
a psychotic attack drone?

24:11.659 --> 24:12.944
Give it a second.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.985
(EXCLAIMS)

24:16.497 --> 24:18.863
(SIGHS)
That's better.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.033
Oh. What in the world
got into her?

24:22.211 --> 24:23.542
We are going to
go find out.

24:23.921 --> 24:26.788
Come on. Let's go fill out
an accident report.
Safety first.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.252
I'll talk to you later,
Carter.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.633
Oh. You told her?
Thanks, Zane.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.089
You showered
with my girlfriend.

24:33.263 --> 24:34.844
You're lucky
I didn't punch myself
in the face.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.221
Don't push me,
Six Pack,

24:36.392 --> 24:38.508
or I'll pound another
bacon-cheese scone.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.019
Another?

24:40.187 --> 24:41.893
It's going to take me
a month to work that off!

24:42.064 --> 24:44.020
Okay. Can the two of you
take this seriously, please?

24:44.191 --> 24:47.809
We need to figure out
what is causing this.
Not to mention this.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.019
I wonder if there's a link.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.569
Between what?

24:51.740 --> 24:53.856
The accidents and us.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.742
You know, first,
the meat explosion,
and now, Martha.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.574
It's the second time
technology has gone nuts
in the last 24 hours.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.080
Third. I pulled over a hottie
in a runaway test vehicle.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.287
You may be hearing
from her attorney.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.577
Oh, yeah? Or maybe
I'll just arrest myself

25:06.755 --> 25:07.790
for impersonating
a police officer.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.751
Oh, let's see how
that goes for you.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.709
Whatever. We need to
get Henry to take
a look at Martha.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.593
(GROANING)
Zane, are you all right?

25:16.098 --> 25:18.384
No. Do I look all right?

25:18.559 --> 25:21.767
I'm hideous.
I'm half scarecrow,
half Andy Griffith.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.895
Okay. We need to get
both of you down
to the neurology lab

25:25.065 --> 25:26.976
before there's
permanent damage.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.766
Or you get stuck
like this.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.359
Stuck like this?

25:33.782 --> 25:36.774
Well, the good news is,
Zane's scans are normal.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.113
Great.
But I'm still
stuck in here.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.612
And what's the bad news?

25:41.915 --> 25:44.531
Jack's SPECT shows
a hyperactive axonal cluster.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.916
Well, that can't be good.

25:46.420 --> 25:49.787
It's an unusual
concentration of high-speed
electrical impulses.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.963
Well, Jack has been
the focal point
of the swapping.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.670
But what would cause
the cluster?

25:53.844 --> 25:56.586
Well, it must be the Z waves.
I mean, the entire crew
is sharing them,

25:56.764 --> 25:59.096
and Jack's brain
is acting as an antenna.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.881
If the neural
transfers continue,

26:01.060 --> 26:02.641
then it'll cause
permanent brain damage.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.802
Well, then, we're going to
have to operate to stop them.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.936
Whoa. Brain surgery?

26:07.107 --> 26:10.019
Sign me up.
I don't want to get stuck
in this doughy body.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.809
Okay, look.
We don't have
time to argue.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.898
Things are critical now.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.280
I think we're going to
have to tell Warren
what's going on.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.111
Well, I only wish
you had come
to me sooner.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.746
So do we.
We had good intentions.

26:25.501 --> 26:29.995
It sounds to me like your
intentions were to hide
a major security threat

26:30.172 --> 26:32.333
in order to save yourjobs.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.086
Well, if you're
splitting hairs...

26:35.260 --> 26:37.842
Look, I appreciate that you
came fon/vard with the truth.

26:38.013 --> 26:41.631
But unfortunately,
it's a little too late.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.974
After the surgery
is completed

26:45.145 --> 26:47.522
and you've stopped
whatever is causing this,

26:47.689 --> 26:51.227
I regret to say,
you're all redacted.
I'm sorry.

26:57.658 --> 26:58.647
Thanks.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.274
(SIGHS)

27:02.704 --> 27:03.363
Zane?

27:05.082 --> 27:06.071
Unfortunately.

27:10.254 --> 27:13.917
Seeing you like this is
really awkward.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.296
Tell me about it.
I have no abs at all.

27:19.096 --> 27:20.085
(CHUCKLES)

27:20.931 --> 27:22.796
How are you really feeling?

27:23.684 --> 27:24.844
Uh...

27:25.602 --> 27:26.682
Kind of nauseous.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.602
I think it's the thought
of you getting naked with him.

27:29.773 --> 27:33.982
I didn't get naked with him.
I got naked with you.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.065
Yeah, except Carter
was in the cockpit.
Okay, please.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.479
Don't say cockpit.

27:39.700 --> 27:40.906
Nothing happened.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.862
But this is the way it starts.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.322
All right? Just like
in the program.
It's just...

27:45.497 --> 27:49.240
Listen to me.
I don't care
about programs.

27:50.294 --> 27:54.663
I care about you.
No matter what
body you're in.

28:01.722 --> 28:02.962
That better be Zane
in there.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.504
In here.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.097
(GASPS)

28:09.771 --> 28:12.103
This is not
my fault. Okay?

28:12.900 --> 28:13.980
Of course.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.225
Let's drill into
your brain, shall we?

28:17.112 --> 28:19.353
Oh, this day sucks.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.988
(MACHINE WHIRRING)
Ow! Okay...

28:25.162 --> 28:28.905
Maybe operating
in your current state
of mind is a bad idea.

28:29.625 --> 28:30.865
I'm fine.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.417
What are those?

28:34.588 --> 28:37.580
The haptic telepresence
gloves are like
a steering wheel

28:37.758 --> 28:39.464
for the nanoprobe
she's about to insert.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.296
I'm going to drive the probe
through your brain

28:41.470 --> 28:43.461
to the axonal cluster
and neutralize it.

28:43.639 --> 28:47.097
Through... Okay...
Well, don't drive angry.

28:55.108 --> 28:57.190
Laser-drill is in position.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.982
Gloves are activated.
Let's get started.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.772
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're going to
knock me out, right?

29:04.284 --> 29:05.820
No, I need you
to stay awake
and make sure

29:05.994 --> 29:07.985
we don't do damage
to your brain
during the procedure.

29:08.830 --> 29:09.819
Oh, that's comforting.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.114
And I don't want you to talk
unless I tell you to.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.408
I need you
to be perfectly still.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.293
Okay. No moving while
you're tooling around
in my brain. Fair.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.419
That fair enough.
Got it.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.582
(SIGHS) Okay.
Let's get started.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.877
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

29:33.105 --> 29:35.721
How are you feeling, Jack?
Never better.

29:37.567 --> 29:41.105
Okay. Almost there.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.946
(BEEPING)

29:45.117 --> 29:47.278
We're getting a spike
in the axonal cluster.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.705
(ALARM RINGING)

29:50.872 --> 29:52.373
Jack, you can't...

29:55.794 --> 29:58.786
Oh, no, no, no, no...

30:01.383 --> 30:02.714
Jack?

30:05.721 --> 30:07.757
Oh, crap.

30:11.518 --> 30:12.382
(ALARM RINGING)

30:12.561 --> 30:13.801
(SIGHS)

30:13.979 --> 30:15.685
Breathe easy, Jack. It's okay.

30:15.856 --> 30:18.768
I'm probing
my own brain, Allie.
It's so not okay.

30:18.942 --> 30:22.309
(STAMMERING) Allison,
do you want me
to disengage the gloves?

30:22.487 --> 30:24.398
No. Leaving the probe there
could cause permanent damage.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.938
We're going to have to
maneuver it out
the way it came in.

30:26.116 --> 30:27.572
But we don't know
what we're doing.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.529
I'm going to guide you
through it. Okay?

30:29.703 --> 30:32.115
Grace, if you could
set up the haptic
telepresence readout

30:32.289 --> 30:33.825
on the main
monitor there.

30:33.999 --> 30:37.617
That would be fantastic.
Jack, it's like
a video game.

30:37.794 --> 30:41.252
Okay? Now, use
your hands to pull

30:41.423 --> 30:43.505
out the probe the
same way it went in.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.415
Okay. So, it's like
operation.

30:45.594 --> 30:46.709
Just don't touch the sides.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.795
If that makes you
feel better, sure.

30:49.973 --> 30:54.637
Okay. Jack, watch my hands.

30:56.063 --> 31:00.227
Easy. Okay. You're doing...
You're doing great, Jack.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.391
Allison, are you okay?

31:03.362 --> 31:05.023
All things considered...
(ALARM BEEPING)

31:05.197 --> 31:07.483
Uh-oh. Okay, maybe
no chit-chat?

31:08.116 --> 31:09.822
Uh, sorry.

31:10.327 --> 31:13.490
GRACE: Okay, almost there.
That's it...

31:14.873 --> 31:15.498
And you're out.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.323
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

31:17.959 --> 31:20.996
Thank God.
Allie, are you okay?

31:23.799 --> 31:24.754
Who's Allie?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.626
Kidding.
Jack, you did great.

31:30.263 --> 31:31.252
That's so mean.

31:31.431 --> 31:33.171
Yeah, well, I'm still
a little mad about that kiss.

31:33.350 --> 31:37.389
That is so not my fault.
I swear, it's all about you.

31:37.854 --> 31:40.687
Jack? We're not out
of the woods, yet.

31:41.858 --> 31:42.847
We have to fix this.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.062
I know.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.018
We will.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.368
Your boyfriend
out of surgery yet?

32:00.168 --> 32:02.705
No. And you have to stop.

32:03.964 --> 32:07.877
Sorry. It'sjust been
a really weird day.

32:09.219 --> 32:11.380
You're the one
who kissed me
with Carter's mouth.

32:11.555 --> 32:15.389
(GROANS) I was...
I was caught up
in the moment, I guess.

32:17.310 --> 32:20.518
Zane, you have to know
how crazy it is

32:20.689 --> 32:24.147
to be jealous of something
with Carter and me
that never happened.

32:24.651 --> 32:27.267
(SIGHS) Yeah,
but the thing is, it's not.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.778
I've been digging into
the programming.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.319
The virtual Eureka
we experienced in there,

32:33.493 --> 32:37.782
it's based on predictive
algorithms from our own
psychological profiles.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.993
So, given the right set
of circumstances,
you and Carter hooking up,

32:41.168 --> 32:44.535
it's notjust possible.
It's probable.

32:46.214 --> 32:50.674
One of the circumstances
was me thinking that
you were dead, right?

32:51.386 --> 32:52.011
Right.

32:52.596 --> 32:56.134
So, don't make me kill you,
and you have
nothing to worry about.

32:57.601 --> 32:58.636
Mmm.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.680
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
You okay?

33:02.689 --> 33:05.772
My head hurts even more.
Or your head, rather.
Would you like your results?

33:06.276 --> 33:08.562
Really? I don't know
what this means.

33:11.573 --> 33:15.816
Well, the data shows that
the hyperactive axonal cluster
is serving as an antenna.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.406
And it's not transmitting.
It's receiving.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.945
From what?

33:20.123 --> 33:21.078
Well, we don't know.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.581
But the spike
in the electrical activity
from each swap

33:23.752 --> 33:25.708
is eroding the myelin sheath.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.494
That doesn't sound good.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.879
Jack, you could
suffer permanent damage

33:30.050 --> 33:32.006
to your central
nervous system.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.381
(SIGHS) Your brain
is not the only thing

33:35.555 --> 33:37.671
suffering from
dangerous spikes
in electrical activity.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.344
Jack, good call.

33:41.353 --> 33:45.687
The other devices that
malfunctioned were all on
the same Z wave frequency.

33:45.857 --> 33:49.145
The re-locator, Martha,
and the Smart Car energy cell.

33:49.319 --> 33:52.527
Have Fargo do an audit.
Find out what project or
device is causing this.

33:52.697 --> 33:55.780
Maybe it's the one
he's been telling Zane
to shut down.

33:57.077 --> 34:00.490
Good luck.
Oh, I don't like this.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.030
Check it out.
I can't believe it.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.574
You've been rebooting
the mainframe after
I specifically told you

34:05.752 --> 34:07.162
to mothball it?

34:07.379 --> 34:08.368
What?

34:08.922 --> 34:10.833
You told me to pursue it
and then report back to you.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.123
That wasn't me.
That was Carter.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.508
All right. Well, how was
I supposed to know that?

34:15.679 --> 34:17.840
Look, the point is,
it's been slowly
re-constructing the files

34:18.014 --> 34:19.265
and I found something here.

34:19.432 --> 34:21.809
Take a look at this.
What are those?

34:22.269 --> 34:24.760
The mainframe has been
tracking the Z waves
of the Astraeus crew,

34:24.938 --> 34:26.974
or it's been trying to.

34:27.941 --> 34:30.978
But it found one
that's still active
inside the program.

34:33.363 --> 34:34.227
Holly?

34:34.739 --> 34:35.728
Yeah.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.698
Fargo, she might
still be in there.

34:38.868 --> 34:41.701
HENRY:
Jack, they're in here.
So is the mainframe.

34:42.664 --> 34:45.280
Jack? Carter's inside
Allison now.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.289
Phrasing. How many times?

34:47.460 --> 34:50.167
So, ifthe program is doing
what I think it's doing,

34:50.338 --> 34:52.670
we need to shut it down
so that they can get back
to where they belong

34:52.841 --> 34:53.751
before they can't.

35:01.725 --> 35:05.013
Hey. No one told me
that you were out, yet.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.721
Yeah, sorry.
It got a little hairy
before...

35:10.317 --> 35:11.682
With the
body-swapping.

35:11.860 --> 35:12.895
Yeah, about that.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.320
And our kiss.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.450
What about our kiss?

35:19.618 --> 35:22.985
Oh, this matrix thing has
everyone acting nuts.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.449
And I really want things
to be normal again.

35:25.624 --> 35:30.414
So, ljust, I thinkthat
we should just be
honest with each other.

35:30.587 --> 35:34.171
You know, so we can
move past it
and get on with our lives.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.544
Honest about what, exactly?

35:41.765 --> 35:44.598
Us. I mean, of course,
I've thought about it.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.976
Why wouldn't I?
You're my best friend.
You're attractive.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.603
I'm really attractive.
(LAUGHS)

35:50.774 --> 35:54.266
I mean, I...
It's not that
I want to pursue it.

35:55.111 --> 35:59.024
You know, ljust...
Why act like it's never
crossed our minds?

36:02.118 --> 36:05.110
I mean, haven't you ever
thought about it?

36:09.793 --> 36:12.876
No. Not really.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.005
Oh.

36:19.386 --> 36:22.093
Well, I'm glad that
we cleared that up.

36:24.099 --> 36:25.635
Okay.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.352
When Zane rebooted
the program,

36:28.520 --> 36:30.226
it began searching
for missing files

36:30.397 --> 36:32.979
which are, in this case,
the crew's brains.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.979
It couldn't find us directly
because we're not
hard-wired to it anymore.

36:37.153 --> 36:41.487
And Jack, of all of you, was
the only one who was linked
to the program wirelessly.

36:41.658 --> 36:42.898
And it found him.

36:43.076 --> 36:44.941
So, I'm a wi-fi hotspot.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.406
Pretty much. Each Z wave
pattern it re-booted for,

36:47.580 --> 36:50.413
the crew had to pass
through that router, you,

36:50.583 --> 36:52.665
which caused the
temporary neural swaps.

36:52.836 --> 36:55.794
If we shut down the program,
the anomalies stop.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.626
Fargo, it's still
in the re-booting process.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.837
If we shut down now,
we could lose access
to all of the restored data,

37:02.011 --> 37:03.512
including Holly.
I know.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.680
Do it.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.311
Ready?

37:20.196 --> 37:21.857
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

37:22.282 --> 37:23.397
Jack?

37:23.575 --> 37:26.112
No. It's Allison. I'm back.
What happened?

37:26.286 --> 37:28.368
(PAGER BEEPING)

37:28.538 --> 37:29.869
Oh, no.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.115
(ALARM RINGING)

37:33.918 --> 37:34.828
What happened?

37:35.003 --> 37:36.664
He jumped up,
took a few steps,
then collapsed.

37:36.838 --> 37:40.626
He's non-responsive.
Jack! Jack! Jack!

37:47.348 --> 37:49.805
Well, he's alive,
but his synapses
are misfiring.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.304
And his EEG
is all over the place.

37:52.729 --> 37:53.935
What does that mean exactly?

37:54.105 --> 37:56.312
Well, if our brains
are like hard drives,
then Jack's is corrupted,

37:56.483 --> 37:58.474
and it's about to
crash permanently.

37:58.651 --> 38:01.267
And ifthat happens,
we could lose him.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.737
Can you re-boot him?

38:04.908 --> 38:08.321
The way my implant does
for my arrhythmia?

38:08.495 --> 38:10.281
The nanoprobe.
If we re-calibrate
the charge...

38:10.455 --> 38:14.243
We can send a small
electrical jolt to the cluster
and neutralize the anomaly.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.076
Okay.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.413
That should do it.
We're running out of time.

38:21.591 --> 38:24.333
I'm in.
The EEG is still erratic.

38:25.261 --> 38:28.845
Delivering charge.
Now.

38:32.519 --> 38:33.679
(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)

38:34.521 --> 38:35.931
Okay.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.848
Pulling out.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.850
(BEEPING)

38:46.199 --> 38:50.238
Jack. Jack, come on.
Come back to me, please.

38:50.954 --> 38:52.865
Come on, love. It's Allie.

38:53.206 --> 38:54.946
Come on, Jack.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.955
(MOANS)

38:57.418 --> 38:59.204
Jack, is that you in there?

38:59.379 --> 39:00.710
(BREATHING)

39:01.464 --> 39:02.328
(SOFTLY) It's me.

39:05.718 --> 39:06.878
I'm here.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.685
There's a happy
ending, huh?

39:18.731 --> 39:19.720
Definitely.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.940
Things do seem prone
to go wrong around here,

39:23.319 --> 39:26.561
but you guys have
a knack for making
everything turn out right.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.402
We have an amazing crew.
It's a team effort.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.074
I noticed that.

39:32.245 --> 39:35.533
Which is why I've reconsidered
my decision to redact
the crew.

39:36.416 --> 39:39.749
If anything,
the last 24 hours
have shown me

39:39.919 --> 39:42.410
just how prepared you are
to resume your duties.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.750
Oh, Warren.
That's a great relief.
Thank you.

39:45.425 --> 39:50.294
Everyone except Fowler.
That kid has issues.
He needs some time off.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.432
He's not the only one.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.309
Oh. Tell me about it.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.519
I've been trying
too hard, Henry,

40:04.277 --> 40:08.270
to fix things.
To get back to normal.

40:09.490 --> 40:12.072
But I think I need
some time off, too.

40:13.161 --> 40:16.278
From all of it.
Being here.

40:19.709 --> 40:24.874
I love you. But, um...
I think I need to
go away for a while.

40:27.342 --> 40:28.331
(SIGHS)

40:30.178 --> 40:33.170
Margherita pizza for Allison.
And for you, Sheriff,

40:33.348 --> 40:38.012
barbecue-bacon-blue-cheese
burger with beer-batter
curly fries. Enjoy.

40:38.186 --> 40:39.642
Thanks, Vince.

40:40.063 --> 40:41.928
Turns out I can
eat burgers again.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.483
I'm just glad that
you're feeling
like yourself again.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.437
Mmm. Come here.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.151
(SIGHS)

40:53.326 --> 40:56.284
Jack...
There's something
I need to say to you.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.570
Yeah, I need to say
something to you, too.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.158
(BOTH STUTTERING)

41:03.878 --> 41:07.917
When I was lying there,
and my brain was fading,

41:09.300 --> 41:13.293
and the thoughts
were just being
stripped away,

41:15.014 --> 41:16.595
the ones that I clung to

41:18.017 --> 41:19.723
were of you and the kids.

41:21.270 --> 41:25.354
I never want to go through
that loss again. Ever.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.851
I want to start building
memories with you.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.362
Forever. Starting now.

41:35.702 --> 41:36.942
So...

41:39.664 --> 41:41.655
(EXHALES)
Jack, what are
you doing?

41:41.833 --> 41:44.119
I know this is
the wrong place.

41:45.294 --> 41:47.455
And I know that
this is the wrong time.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.495
But I don't want to wait
anylonger

41:50.800 --> 41:53.667
Yeah. Allison...

42:04.480 --> 42:05.686
Will you marry me?

42:08.735 --> 42:12.102
And I also know
that this is a
beer-battered potato ring.

42:12.280 --> 42:12.894
(LAUGHING)

42:13.489 --> 42:16.572
But, uh...
People are staring.

42:16.743 --> 42:19.359
So, what do you say?

42:25.626 --> 42:26.911
I say yes.

42:27.962 --> 42:30.169
MAN: Way to go, Sheriff.
(APPLAUSE)

42:33.885 --> 42:35.750
VINCENT:
Champagne for everyone.

43:03.790 --> 43:07.908
