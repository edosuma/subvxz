00:01.666 --> 00:03.500
Previously
on Witches of East End...
Nice to see you again.

00:03.533 --> 00:05.866
Tommy Cole. If you want
to get together sometime,

00:05.900 --> 00:07.466
my number's 911.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.800
Frederick.
Mom.

00:08.833 --> 00:10.200
WENDY:
I don't trust him.

00:10.233 --> 00:12.200
Where have you been?
I can't remember.

00:12.233 --> 00:15.200
Did anyone or anything come
through the portal with you?

00:15.233 --> 00:16.866
(distorted over phone):
I saw you kill your brother.

00:16.900 --> 00:19.066
I'm gonna need $50,000 in cash.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.400
I'm calling the cops.
Do that,
and those JPEGs go viral.

00:21.433 --> 00:23.133
Dash?

00:23.166 --> 00:24.200
(gasps)

00:25.233 --> 00:26.866
Dash, stop!

00:26.900 --> 00:30.000
As long as the doll stays
underwater, no one will

00:30.033 --> 00:31.400
ever find the body.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.400
It's really you.
Who else would it be?

00:39.366 --> 00:41.500
JOANNA:
Victor, where the hell are you?

00:43.766 --> 00:47.733
Ooh, picnic blanket,
cooler...

00:47.766 --> 00:51.166
Is this your, uh, go‐to
first romantic date?

00:51.200 --> 00:53.733
(laughing)
Do you have a problem
with romance?

00:53.766 --> 00:56.500
No. I'm just not a wine‐
and‐cheese kind of gal.

00:56.533 --> 00:59.566
Which is why
I brought beer...

00:59.600 --> 01:01.066
and brats.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.300
Oh. Okay, you have
my attention.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.466
Well, I had it
the day we met.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.033
(mock gasp)
Oh.

01:07.066 --> 01:08.700
WENDY:
You know, there's
a fine line

01:08.733 --> 01:10.533
between confident
and cocky.

01:10.566 --> 01:13.133
So... besides giving me crap,

01:13.166 --> 01:16.133
what else do you do?
Mm, a little of this,
a little of that.

01:16.166 --> 01:17.666
I still haven't
quite found my niche.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.000
(rat squeaking)
Rat! Rat!

01:21.433 --> 01:23.133
Oh! Son of a bitch!
Hold still.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.533
(gasps)

01:24.566 --> 01:26.433
(rat squeaking)

01:31.766 --> 01:33.066
(pants)

01:33.100 --> 01:34.400
You okay?

01:34.433 --> 01:36.433
Yeah.

01:37.333 --> 01:40.066
Okay.

01:42.233 --> 01:44.633
MAN:
Victor, my royal prisoner.

01:44.666 --> 01:46.466
It's been a while.

01:46.500 --> 01:49.733
So, what do you call the missus?

01:49.766 --> 01:52.800
Just Joanna?
Or honey?

01:52.833 --> 01:55.000
Sweetie? Sugar?

01:55.033 --> 01:57.466
I'm gonna go with, "Darling...

01:57.500 --> 01:59.900
I'm leaving you for a stripper."

01:59.933 --> 02:03.366
(laughs)
Like you could land a stripper.

02:04.266 --> 02:06.800
"Missed flight.

02:06.833 --> 02:10.000
(rat squeaking)
Be in late tomorrow."

02:13.866 --> 02:16.533
Well, what happened?

02:18.066 --> 02:21.566
I found Wendy.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.066
Did she know
it was you?

02:23.100 --> 02:25.166
I don't think so.

02:26.066 --> 02:29.300
She had her mind on man meat,

02:29.333 --> 02:32.566
yet still managed to be
a pain in my ass.

02:50.166 --> 02:53.000
(exhales):
Thank you.

03:03.666 --> 03:05.200
Ingrid.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.633
Dash.
Hey.

03:06.666 --> 03:08.900
Hi. What are you
doing here?

03:08.933 --> 03:11.666
Just, uh, you know,
I wanted to check in on you,

03:11.700 --> 03:13.500
see how you were holding up.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.833
Okay. I think.
How are you?

03:15.866 --> 03:17.900
Actually, I'm better
than I thought I'd be.

03:17.933 --> 03:20.666
(whispers): Dash,
you killed a man.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.466
And I helped cover it up.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.533
And I'm just sorry that you
ended up in the middle of it.

03:26.566 --> 03:28.033
The thing is...

03:28.066 --> 03:31.400
you didn't know what
was happening to you.

03:31.433 --> 03:33.666
I mean, maybe you...

03:33.700 --> 03:36.700
sensed it or you felt it,
but you didn't really know,

03:36.733 --> 03:38.400
and I did.

03:39.933 --> 03:41.633
Ingrid...

03:41.666 --> 03:43.900
Ingrid, if you're saying
this was somehow your fault...

03:43.933 --> 03:47.800
Maybe if I had told you
sooner, none of this
would have happened.

03:47.833 --> 03:49.800
Look...

03:49.833 --> 03:51.800
I... am just grateful

03:51.833 --> 03:53.866
that you showed up
when you did.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.533
If there is ever
anything you need,

03:56.566 --> 03:59.166
I'm here for you.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.066
(birds chirping)
(Wendy groans)

04:03.100 --> 04:05.700
I wasn't expecting to
see you this morning.

04:05.733 --> 04:07.666
(exhales): Oh!
Is that your subtle way

04:07.700 --> 04:10.166
of implying that I always
put out on a first date?

04:10.200 --> 04:13.000
I wasn't trying for subtle‐‐
I take it it didn't go well.

04:13.033 --> 04:17.066
(chuckles) Actually,
it started out pretty great.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.500
And then...

04:18.533 --> 04:20.200
a rat crashed our picnic.

04:20.233 --> 04:21.500
Totally killed the mood.

04:21.533 --> 04:23.800
Oh, I'm sorry.
Eh,

04:23.833 --> 04:25.900
just another example
of the Beauchamp women's

04:25.933 --> 04:27.800
notoriously crappy
luck with men.

04:27.833 --> 04:30.533
Hey! We don't all
have crappy luck.

04:30.566 --> 04:32.400
I'm happy with Victor.

04:32.433 --> 04:35.533
Yeah. After you fought nonstop
for three centuries

04:35.566 --> 04:37.366
and were estranged for two.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.833
No, but I mean lately.

04:38.866 --> 04:40.633
I mean... it's been good.

04:40.666 --> 04:42.066
(laughs)

04:42.100 --> 04:43.966
Been really good.
So...

04:44.000 --> 04:45.333
how was the "welcome home" sex?

04:45.366 --> 04:46.700
He texted me
this morning.

04:46.733 --> 04:48.566
He's gonna come later today.
Oh, good.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.366
Well, Tommy wants a do‐over date
later today.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.800
I just don't know
if I'm up for it.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.833
Nah, you're right, I'd go back
to emotionless one‐night stands.

04:56.866 --> 04:58.566
After all, you
have an eternity

04:58.600 --> 04:59.900
to find a soul mate.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.166
Reverse psychology? Really?

05:02.200 --> 05:03.900
Mm‐hmm.

05:05.866 --> 05:08.333
(birds chirping)

05:08.366 --> 05:09.733
So, uh...

05:09.766 --> 05:12.400
Eva‐‐ how'd
you guys meet?

05:12.433 --> 05:14.466
Picked me up on the beach.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.866
Literally.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.466
Boat was wrecked,
my head was smashed up.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.200
Do you have any idea
what happened?

05:20.233 --> 05:24.666
The last thing I remember,
I was loading up my boat.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.733
After I set out,
there must have been a storm.

05:26.766 --> 05:29.233
I guess I hit my head
hard enough to be knocked out

05:29.266 --> 05:30.366
a few days.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.833
Next thing I know...

05:31.866 --> 05:34.533
You woke up in Santo Domingo.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.166
I'm just glad you're okay.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.300
(knocking)

05:41.333 --> 05:43.500
Oh, that must be him.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.033
Finally.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.066
Mr. Shane.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.066
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.
Mm‐hmm.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.500
I don't think you've met
my brother Killian.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.166
SHANE:
Your mother spoke
very highly

05:57.200 --> 05:58.200
of you, Killian.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.633
That's surprising to hear.

05:59.666 --> 06:01.033
Actually,
I'm just being polite‐‐

06:01.066 --> 06:03.366
she rarely spoke
of either of you.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.666
Anyway,

06:04.700 --> 06:06.400
she wanted me to give you this.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.800
The will is inside here?

06:07.833 --> 06:09.400
To be honest,
I don't know what's inside.

06:09.433 --> 06:10.466
She left me strict instructions

06:10.500 --> 06:11.900
to deliver it upon her death,

06:11.933 --> 06:14.200
but only when the two of you
were together.

06:14.233 --> 06:15.666
What are we supposed to do?

06:15.700 --> 06:17.300
Just a shot in the dark here,

06:17.333 --> 06:19.066
but I'd say... open it.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.366
Well...

06:20.400 --> 06:22.233
thanks, Mr. Shane.
My pleasure.

06:22.266 --> 06:24.866
I'll send you a bill.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.500
Of course.
(chuckles)

06:28.200 --> 06:30.033
(sighs):
Okay.

06:30.066 --> 06:32.600
Ready to see
our inheritance?

06:34.866 --> 06:37.033
What the hell is that?

06:39.833 --> 06:41.200
Looks like...

06:41.233 --> 06:43.666
some sort
of ancient lockbox.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.233
It's a puzzle.

06:45.266 --> 06:47.466
We're supposed to solve it.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.600
Okay, let me try.

06:53.866 --> 06:56.066
(rapid clicking)

06:57.833 --> 06:59.666
I think...

06:59.700 --> 07:01.400
We need to talk.

07:01.433 --> 07:04.100
Yeah.

07:08.833 --> 07:10.466
Are you familiar

07:10.500 --> 07:13.333
with the ancient
Chinese art of Lingchi?

07:13.366 --> 07:15.633
Some call it
"slow slicing"

07:15.666 --> 07:17.966
or "death
by a thousand cuts."

07:18.000 --> 07:21.333
Isis is...
a master.

07:21.366 --> 07:23.833
Eventually you
will submit.

07:23.866 --> 07:27.333
We've been tracking portals
all over the world.

07:27.366 --> 07:30.233
We know the one in
East End was open.

07:30.266 --> 07:33.333
MAN:
Clearly, the tales of you
royals destroying the key

07:33.366 --> 07:36.166
was to keep the lowly likes
of us away.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.533
You...

07:40.566 --> 07:42.133
will tell us...

07:42.166 --> 07:43.833
where the key is.

07:43.866 --> 07:45.400
Go to hell.

07:45.433 --> 07:46.966
We're already here.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.033
Now we want to go home.

07:54.266 --> 07:57.666
If he doesn't talk soon,
we could try to break Wendy.

07:58.533 --> 08:00.533
Anybody but Joanna.

08:00.566 --> 08:03.600
(electronic tones sound)
That bitch scares me.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.833
Oh. Speak of the devil.

08:05.866 --> 08:07.900
"Let me know
as soon as you land.

08:07.933 --> 08:09.900
Frederick is
so excited to see you."

08:09.933 --> 08:11.500
ISIS:
He must have come

08:11.533 --> 08:14.333
through the portal.
This is good
news for us.

08:14.366 --> 08:16.566
Bad news for you.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.433
(low grunting)

08:23.366 --> 08:26.000
(blade slicing)
(grunting)

08:26.033 --> 08:28.400
No! No...!

08:47.393 --> 08:49.093
"Sequere vestigia"?

08:49.126 --> 08:50.526
What's it mean?

08:50.559 --> 08:52.959
It's Latin‐‐
it means "follow the trail."

08:52.993 --> 08:54.626
What trail?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.459
No idea.

08:56.493 --> 08:59.526
I think it's all pretty crazy.

08:59.559 --> 09:01.559
We're warlocks.

09:01.593 --> 09:04.093
I still can't wrap
my mind around it.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.259
If it wasn't for Eva...

09:06.293 --> 09:07.726
What do you mean?

09:09.626 --> 09:11.059
She's a witch.

09:11.093 --> 09:15.293
I think that's why
we found each other.

09:15.326 --> 09:16.926
Well, uh...

09:16.959 --> 09:18.959
get ready for this.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.893
Guess who else is one of us?

09:22.426 --> 09:23.826
Beauchamps.

09:25.459 --> 09:26.559
Did Freya ever tell you?

09:26.593 --> 09:28.259
Are you kidding?
I had no idea.

09:28.293 --> 09:29.426
She's a lying bitch.

09:29.459 --> 09:31.893
Ingrid's cool, though.

09:31.926 --> 09:33.593
She's been helping me
with all this.

09:33.626 --> 09:35.726
Says our powers
must have been dormant

09:35.759 --> 09:38.626
our whole lives, and Mom's
death activated them somehow.

09:38.659 --> 09:40.726
So Freya knows that...
I don't know

09:40.759 --> 09:42.393
and I don't care.

09:42.426 --> 09:45.426
I can't believe
she didn't say anything.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.526
(mock gasp)

09:54.559 --> 09:56.126
(inhales, exhales)

09:56.159 --> 09:58.026
(clears throat)
Whatever you do,

09:58.059 --> 10:00.159
don't choke.

10:01.626 --> 10:03.226
TOMMY:
Oh!

10:03.259 --> 10:05.793
Look, you don't have
to take your turn.

10:05.826 --> 10:07.559
I completely
understand, okay?
Mm.

10:07.593 --> 10:09.793
This game isn't
for everybody.
It's not easy.

10:12.259 --> 10:14.126
(laughs): I'm sorry,
what were you saying?

10:14.159 --> 10:15.793
I was saying... damn!

10:15.826 --> 10:17.026
Uh‐huh.
Wait.

10:17.059 --> 10:19.426
Whatever you do...

10:19.459 --> 10:22.059
don't choke.

10:22.093 --> 10:23.393
(gasps)

10:25.226 --> 10:26.959
Holy crap, that one...

10:26.993 --> 10:29.593
friggin' curved.
Yeah.

10:29.626 --> 10:32.526
Okay, okay,
I'll tell you what,
you do one more

10:32.559 --> 10:35.259
like that, and I'll
buy you another beer.
(laughs)

10:35.293 --> 10:38.059
(dart falls to ground)
What, you weren't gonna
buy me one anyway?

10:38.093 --> 10:40.626
Well, I mean, you
kind of have to earn it.

10:40.659 --> 10:41.726
Ow!

10:41.759 --> 10:42.459
(gasps)

10:42.493 --> 10:43.759
Aah!
Uh‐oh.

10:43.793 --> 10:45.126
Oh, mother f'er.

10:45.159 --> 10:47.793
Aah!
Sana. Sana.

10:47.826 --> 10:50.559
What? That was just a nick,

10:50.593 --> 10:52.526
stop being a baby.

10:52.559 --> 10:55.126
That's a nice apology.

10:55.159 --> 10:58.226
You know, we're not having
the best of luck on our dates.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.259
This is definitely
worse than usual.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.359
Uh, sorry‐‐
what does that mean?

11:03.393 --> 11:05.059
Nothing. Never mind.
Uh, maybe we should

11:05.093 --> 11:06.593
just quit while we're ahead.

11:06.626 --> 11:09.626
No way. This is the best time
I've had in a while.

11:09.659 --> 11:11.059
I'll take a chance if you will.

11:11.093 --> 11:13.159
Okay.

11:15.426 --> 11:16.793
Good‐bye, Freya.

11:21.893 --> 11:22.893
As requested.

11:22.926 --> 11:24.193
Ah.
Although I must say

11:24.226 --> 11:25.626
I prefer mead. Alcohol from

11:25.659 --> 11:28.726
potatoes just seems so...
Beneath you?

11:28.759 --> 11:30.826
Freddie. It's been a while.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.926
Ivar.

11:34.893 --> 11:35.959
Wow. It's been, uh...

11:35.993 --> 11:38.026
A long freakin' time.

11:38.059 --> 11:39.593
You look great.

11:39.626 --> 11:40.693
Hey, hey, hey...

11:40.726 --> 11:42.193
save some for me.

11:42.226 --> 11:43.559
Hmm.

11:43.593 --> 11:45.893
Easy, darling,
let him breathe.

11:45.926 --> 11:47.393
Let him breathe.

11:47.426 --> 11:49.126
I take it you three have met?

11:49.159 --> 11:51.426
You don't remember us, Freya?

11:53.726 --> 11:55.793
So you're a new Freya.

11:55.826 --> 11:57.359
(soft gasp)
I guess those

11:57.393 --> 11:58.959
curse rumors are true.
Huh.

11:58.993 --> 12:01.526
We all used to be friends,
back in the old country.

12:01.559 --> 12:03.193
We were quite
the wild group.

12:03.226 --> 12:04.693
Got in a lot
of trouble together.

12:04.726 --> 12:06.526
You didn't get into
trouble, Freya.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.259
At least nothing
you couldn't get out of.

12:08.293 --> 12:09.359
You were a good girl.

12:09.393 --> 12:11.526
We were
a wild bunch.

12:11.559 --> 12:13.193
Well, that sounds
intriguing.

12:13.226 --> 12:15.259
Aren't you
busy working?

12:15.293 --> 12:17.893
I was, but now I want
to hear the details.

12:19.559 --> 12:22.526
Don't worry, Freddie.

12:22.559 --> 12:25.126
We'll only tell the
stories about you.

12:31.093 --> 12:33.759
"Follow the trail."

12:33.793 --> 12:35.893
Think it means the trail
out by the woods?

12:35.926 --> 12:38.293
Maybe it's‐it's like a metaphor.

12:38.326 --> 12:39.626
For what?

12:39.659 --> 12:41.459
(snaps fingers)

12:41.493 --> 12:42.959
Not bad.

12:42.993 --> 12:45.259
God, think about
what we could have

12:45.293 --> 12:46.759
done with that as kids.

12:46.793 --> 12:48.593
We probably would have
killed each other.

12:48.626 --> 12:50.726
And Mom would have blamed me.

12:50.759 --> 12:53.793
Her golden Dash
could do no wrong.

12:53.826 --> 12:55.859
Hey, you know what?

12:55.893 --> 12:58.759
Maybe this isn't a metaphor.
Maybe it's a spell.

12:58.793 --> 13:01.093
The cryptex didn't open until
we were both touching it,

13:01.126 --> 13:04.059
so maybe if we said
the spell together...

13:08.093 --> 13:11.326
BOTH:
Sequere vestigia.

13:36.759 --> 13:38.659
We need to pry this up.

13:40.259 --> 13:43.093
All right, okay.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.393
Just a little more.
Yup. Yeah.

13:45.426 --> 13:47.159
(grunts)

13:50.959 --> 13:52.126
See anything?

13:52.159 --> 13:53.593
Yeah.

13:53.626 --> 13:55.226
Yeah, hold on.

14:04.326 --> 14:05.793
What is it?

14:12.226 --> 14:13.859
I think it's
our family's Grimoire.

14:13.893 --> 14:15.126
What's a Grimoire?

14:15.159 --> 14:17.859
A spell book.

14:17.893 --> 14:20.793
We should try one.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.126
And then
Freddie did us a solid

14:23.159 --> 14:26.526
and he stole the sacred scroll.
Why?

14:26.559 --> 14:28.359
To piss off the temple elders.
I wanted to hand

14:28.393 --> 14:30.559
the scrolls over to the people
so they'd know the assholes

14:30.593 --> 14:32.759
in power bent the laws to
fit their depraved morality.

14:32.793 --> 14:35.226
Oh, yeah, you have always
been about morality.

14:35.259 --> 14:36.726
Oh, that sounds dangerous.

14:36.759 --> 14:38.059
He's quite the
daredevil,

14:38.093 --> 14:39.459
your brother.
Mm.

14:39.493 --> 14:40.759
I'm sure you're aware.

14:40.793 --> 14:42.359
Oh, really?

14:42.393 --> 14:44.026
When I was young
and stupid, maybe.

14:44.059 --> 14:45.759
Not anymore.

14:45.793 --> 14:47.626
We were all a bit rowdy.

14:47.659 --> 14:49.759
But then Isis and I
took it too far

14:49.793 --> 14:51.859
and we got banished from Asgard.

14:51.893 --> 14:53.026
Why, what did you do?

14:53.059 --> 14:55.059
We pissed off
your grandfather.

14:55.093 --> 14:56.893
Consider yourselves lucky.
At least you didn't

14:56.926 --> 14:59.226
have to stay and face his wrath.
It hasn't

14:59.259 --> 15:03.093
exactly been a cakewalk
on this side of the portal.

15:03.126 --> 15:06.926
Hey. That's why you have
your brother to see you through.

15:08.759 --> 15:11.926
Oh. Whoa, wait,
you guys are...

15:12.759 --> 15:13.926
Twins.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.093
Like you.

15:15.126 --> 15:16.959
Oh... No,

15:16.993 --> 15:18.559
not like us.
Yeah, okay, um,

15:18.593 --> 15:19.793
can you excuse us?

15:19.826 --> 15:21.493
Yeah.

15:23.493 --> 15:25.693
Twincest? Seriously?

15:25.726 --> 15:27.893
They're Zurka.
Shape‐shifting bottom‐feeders.

15:27.926 --> 15:30.726
Their clan is despised in
Asgard, with good reason.

15:30.759 --> 15:31.926
But they were your friends.

15:31.959 --> 15:33.259
"Friends" is
a strong word.

15:33.293 --> 15:34.559
I was acting out,
they were happy

15:34.593 --> 15:35.893
to go along and
take advantage.

15:35.926 --> 15:37.193
They are a walking freak fest.

15:37.226 --> 15:38.593
We need to get rid of them.

15:38.626 --> 15:39.793
I'll do it, okay?

15:39.826 --> 15:41.626
Trust me,
I can handle these two.

15:41.659 --> 15:43.293
(sighs)

15:47.826 --> 15:49.359
Where's your sister?

15:49.393 --> 15:52.359
Can't keep her on a
leash. I've tried.

15:52.393 --> 15:53.893
Looks like it's
just down to us.

15:53.926 --> 15:55.393
What do you want?

15:55.426 --> 15:57.226
We took the fall for you.

15:57.259 --> 15:59.293
You owe us for...
I don't owe you

15:59.326 --> 16:01.393
anything.
Now, I suggest you leave

16:01.426 --> 16:03.726
before I get angry
and do something you'll regret.

16:05.593 --> 16:09.593
And I suggest you reconsider
that statement.

16:12.593 --> 16:14.593
VICTOR: Aah!
Hmm?

16:14.626 --> 16:16.826
My father...
(groaning)

16:25.459 --> 16:27.626
(faint squeak)

16:35.293 --> 16:37.693
Mm.

16:37.726 --> 16:41.059
You were always
so pretty.

16:43.493 --> 16:45.026
We should have some fun.

16:45.059 --> 16:48.026
Won't your brother get jealous?
It's okay.

16:48.059 --> 16:49.359
He can play, too.

16:49.393 --> 16:52.193
Thanks, but I'm really, really,

16:52.226 --> 16:54.259
really not interested.

16:54.293 --> 16:55.626
(gasps)

16:55.659 --> 16:57.393
What...

17:00.926 --> 17:02.659
(whooshing)

17:08.593 --> 17:10.226
According to the book,
this spell

17:10.259 --> 17:12.026
should make us indelebilis.
What's that mean?

17:12.059 --> 17:13.193
This isn't exactly
med school Latin,

17:13.226 --> 17:14.293
but from what I can make out,

17:14.326 --> 17:16.526
it should protect us from harm.

17:16.559 --> 17:19.526
Physically, mentally
and emotionally.

17:19.559 --> 17:21.426
So nothing
would be able to hurt us.

17:21.459 --> 17:22.926
Nothing.

17:24.226 --> 17:25.759
Worth a shot.

17:31.493 --> 17:34.593
Eva told me a little
about blood magic.

17:34.626 --> 17:35.926
It's no joke.

17:35.959 --> 17:37.759
Oh, it's just a drop.

18:03.259 --> 18:05.926
All right.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.359
Say it with me.

18:08.393 --> 18:12.093
BOTH:
Aeternum indelibilis.

18:12.126 --> 18:13.726
Aeternum

18:13.759 --> 18:16.659
indelibilis.

18:18.126 --> 18:19.459
You think it worked?

18:19.493 --> 18:21.693
I can tell you
with total certainty

18:21.726 --> 18:24.126
that I have absolutely no idea.

18:28.926 --> 18:30.193
(sighs)

18:30.226 --> 18:31.893
Hey, look‐‐ if I hold it
up to my ear,

18:31.926 --> 18:33.359
I can hear the ocean...

18:33.393 --> 18:35.426
(laughs)
where I dropped it,
and it's broken

18:35.459 --> 18:37.293
forever.
Yeah. I'm sorry
about that.

18:37.326 --> 18:39.393
That was kind of my fault
for knocking into you,

18:39.426 --> 18:41.459
but we don't need a phone.
Because I

18:41.493 --> 18:43.059
can change a tire

18:43.093 --> 18:46.593
all by myself.
(chuckles)

18:46.626 --> 18:48.259
(grunts)

18:48.293 --> 18:51.526
Okay, that's kind of sexy.

18:51.559 --> 18:54.126
That's what I'm going for.
In a... In a way.

18:54.159 --> 18:55.193
I don't think they see us.

18:55.226 --> 18:56.726
TOMMY:
What?

18:56.759 --> 18:58.593
Regere et conservare.

18:58.626 --> 18:59.959
(tires screech)

18:59.993 --> 19:01.593
Whoa!

19:01.626 --> 19:03.726
Damn, that was close.
You okay?

19:03.759 --> 19:05.426
Yeah.

19:05.459 --> 19:08.226
Yeah?

19:08.259 --> 19:10.293
I think the universe is trying
to tell us something.

19:10.326 --> 19:12.593
What? No, no, no.
No way. Nothing happened.

19:12.626 --> 19:14.093
We're fine.

19:16.926 --> 19:18.793
Hey, so what's with the...

19:18.826 --> 19:20.026
What's with the Latin?

19:20.059 --> 19:21.526
I heard it before
when you were

19:21.559 --> 19:23.093
pulling the dart
out of my back.

19:23.126 --> 19:26.859
Oh, it's just...
It's a calming mantra.

19:26.893 --> 19:28.893
A calming...

19:28.926 --> 19:30.359
Well, maybe I should try one.

19:30.393 --> 19:32.393
Last time I came this
close to getting killed,

19:32.426 --> 19:33.859
I actually ended up dead.

19:33.893 --> 19:35.793
(laughs)

19:35.826 --> 19:37.726
Okay, I have questions.

19:37.759 --> 19:38.726
I was a medic.

19:38.759 --> 19:40.626
I did a tour in Fallujah.

19:40.659 --> 19:42.226
You did?

19:42.259 --> 19:44.726
Um...

19:44.759 --> 19:49.093
We were on call to pick up
some injured Marines.

19:49.126 --> 19:51.959
And then, bam.

19:51.993 --> 19:54.426
It was like a thousand
gunshots all at once.

19:56.259 --> 19:57.559
I stopped breathing.

19:57.593 --> 19:59.126
And...

19:59.159 --> 20:01.459
Vince, this other medic,

20:01.493 --> 20:03.126
he pulled himself over

20:03.159 --> 20:05.126
and he started
giving me CPR.

20:05.159 --> 20:07.226
And when that didn't work,
he slammed a needle

20:07.259 --> 20:10.459
full of adrenaline
into my heart.

20:10.493 --> 20:12.226
I sat straight up.

20:12.259 --> 20:15.326
He must get a great
Christmas gift every year.

20:16.659 --> 20:18.093
He had internal bleeding.

20:18.126 --> 20:20.926
He died in my arms.

20:20.959 --> 20:22.259
I'm sorry.

20:22.293 --> 20:23.459
Why I'm here

20:23.493 --> 20:25.193
and he's not...

20:25.226 --> 20:26.759
I'll never know.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.426
But what I do
know is that

20:29.459 --> 20:32.993
existing just isn't enough
for me anymore.

20:47.426 --> 20:50.326
Did you know your daddy
was a screamer?

20:52.926 --> 20:54.459
You want to do this here?

20:54.493 --> 20:55.926
Tempore congelata.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.193
I never get tired
of that spell.

21:04.226 --> 21:06.259
Mortals are so pliable.

21:10.459 --> 21:12.259
They are.

21:12.293 --> 21:14.559
I'm not.

21:14.593 --> 21:16.593
This isn't a negotiation,
Frederick.

21:16.626 --> 21:18.093
You'll give me the key

21:18.126 --> 21:19.593
so that we can go home.

21:19.626 --> 21:21.126
It's not the home you remember.

21:21.159 --> 21:22.893
It's got to be better
than this hellhole

21:22.926 --> 21:24.226
full of meat puppets.

21:24.259 --> 21:26.426
I don't have the key.
Okay?

21:26.459 --> 21:28.259
And‐And even if I did,

21:28.293 --> 21:30.226
I can't open that door again.

21:30.259 --> 21:33.093
It's not safe. There's no
telling what'll come through.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.426
I don't give a crap.

21:36.493 --> 21:40.526
You'll do it,
or we'll kill your father.

21:40.559 --> 21:43.693
From the looks of that
video, I'm already too late.

21:43.726 --> 21:45.759
But you're not too late
for Freya.

21:47.259 --> 21:49.793
We have her, too.

21:51.493 --> 21:54.459
You have two hours
to give me the portal key,

21:54.493 --> 21:56.926
or your twin dies.

21:58.893 --> 22:00.693
(whoosh, glass breaking)

22:00.726 --> 22:02.659
(crowd chatter)

22:10.059 --> 22:12.426
I don't feel any different yet.
How about you?

22:12.459 --> 22:16.159
I feel okay, I guess.

22:17.293 --> 22:19.559
I have an idea.

22:19.593 --> 22:21.959
Let's see
if we're really protected.

22:21.993 --> 22:23.759
Put your arm in the flame.

22:23.793 --> 22:26.059
You put your arm in the flame.
This whole thing was your idea.

22:26.093 --> 22:28.659
All right.

22:37.593 --> 22:40.559
Oh.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.459
Oh... (gasps)

22:42.493 --> 22:43.793
Try it.

22:49.626 --> 22:52.693
Aah! Damn it!

22:52.726 --> 22:53.959
You okay?

22:53.993 --> 22:55.093
No.

22:55.126 --> 22:57.093
(guttural groaning)

22:57.126 --> 22:59.659
(coughing)

23:16.385 --> 23:17.552
(crickets chirping)

23:17.585 --> 23:21.085
(phone ringing)

23:23.796 --> 23:24.929
Dash?
Ingrid...

23:24.962 --> 23:26.196
Hey, what's up?

23:26.229 --> 23:27.396
DASH: Look, I‐I screwed up
the spell

23:27.429 --> 23:28.696
and Kill‐Killian's in trouble.

23:28.729 --> 23:29.996
Okay, try and calm down.

23:30.029 --> 23:32.196
Don't do anything
until I get there.

23:32.229 --> 23:33.729
I'm on my way.

23:33.762 --> 23:35.429
Yeah. Bye.

23:35.462 --> 23:36.862
She'll be here soon.

23:36.896 --> 23:39.429
She'll‐she'll
know what to do.

23:41.096 --> 23:44.229
She better hurry
the hell up.

23:59.529 --> 24:01.429
(whispering):
Aperi.

24:13.129 --> 24:14.729
What are you doing?

24:17.096 --> 24:19.996
Some witches from the Zurka
clan have Freya and Dad.

24:20.029 --> 24:21.862
They want the
portal reopened.

24:21.896 --> 24:23.596
That's what drew them here.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.362
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

24:25.396 --> 24:26.929
Because it's my fault.

24:26.962 --> 24:28.896
They think I owe them,
now they threaten my family.

24:28.929 --> 24:30.262
I need to fix it.

24:30.296 --> 24:32.562
No. I'll deal with it.
You tell me.

24:32.596 --> 24:36.662
I know how to track a Zurka.
They're most likely underground.

24:36.696 --> 24:38.896
I do have a plan. I'm meeting
one of them at the library.

24:38.929 --> 24:41.362
Just stay here.
You've done enough.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.262
If Ivar doesn't think I'm
bringing him the key to Asgard,

24:43.296 --> 24:44.662
they'll kill Freya and Dad.

24:44.696 --> 24:46.529
They'll try and kill them
either way.

24:46.562 --> 24:49.229
At least if you're here,
I know you're safe.

24:50.896 --> 24:53.429
Wendy, answer,
damn it.

24:57.062 --> 25:00.262
(door closes)

25:01.762 --> 25:04.262
(insects trilling)

25:15.462 --> 25:17.562
I'm here for you.

25:17.596 --> 25:19.562
I'm here to feed you.

25:22.429 --> 25:24.962
(panting)

25:30.562 --> 25:33.096
(panting)

25:48.729 --> 25:51.262
(panting)

25:51.296 --> 25:54.096
(panting)

26:01.462 --> 26:04.229
(panting)

26:04.262 --> 26:06.529
(moaning)

26:06.562 --> 26:09.262
You...

26:09.296 --> 26:11.729
smell delicious.

26:11.762 --> 26:14.029
(sniffing)

26:14.062 --> 26:17.896
Libera...
Liberationem...

26:17.929 --> 26:19.529
(sighs)
Liberationem.

26:19.562 --> 26:21.929
Liberationem.
Liberationem.

26:21.962 --> 26:22.929
Aw.

26:22.962 --> 26:25.229
You're adorable.

26:25.262 --> 26:26.829
You're sick.

26:26.862 --> 26:28.562
I know.

26:28.596 --> 26:31.262
That's why I got along
so well with your brother.

26:31.296 --> 26:33.862
Freddie‐‐ well,

26:33.896 --> 26:36.762
he's the sickest one
out of all of us.

26:36.796 --> 26:40.062
I once saw him cut out a man's
eyeballs just for looking

26:40.096 --> 26:42.029
at his girl.

26:42.062 --> 26:44.096
Freya!

26:44.929 --> 26:46.262
(gasps)

26:50.596 --> 26:53.596
Sanden markere tid!

26:55.629 --> 26:57.796
(panting)

27:02.596 --> 27:04.696
(squeaking)

27:04.729 --> 27:06.929
(sighs)
Mom. Thank God.

27:06.962 --> 27:08.762
Freya, don't move!

27:08.796 --> 27:10.096
(sighs)

27:12.896 --> 27:15.896
If you stand up,
the spell will kill us all.

27:28.629 --> 27:31.296
(insects chirring)

27:36.429 --> 27:38.129
Oh, my God.

27:40.462 --> 27:43.129
(groans)

27:50.562 --> 27:54.096
Dash...

27:56.396 --> 27:58.729
(groans)

27:58.762 --> 28:01.262
(panting)

28:04.862 --> 28:07.229
(bell tolling in distance)

28:07.262 --> 28:09.696
This is useless. Come on.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.429
You're a doctor.

28:11.462 --> 28:12.996
Isn't there anything
you can do?

28:13.029 --> 28:15.162
They didn't teach us this
in med school.

28:15.196 --> 28:17.562
Then take me to the hospital.

28:17.596 --> 28:20.162
(wheezing)
Wait for me.
Wait for me.

28:20.196 --> 28:22.062
Yeah, yeah.
Go easy. Go easy.

28:22.096 --> 28:24.096
Come on. Come on, let's
go to the hospital.

28:24.129 --> 28:25.696
Wait! Wait!

28:25.729 --> 28:28.662
(cracking sound, groaning)

28:28.696 --> 28:30.096
Take it easy.

28:30.129 --> 28:31.929
Put your legs up.

28:31.962 --> 28:35.096
I think... you broke... a rib.

28:35.129 --> 28:37.662
What the hell
is going on?

28:37.696 --> 28:42.029
Hey. Are you okay?

28:44.096 --> 28:47.029
(panting)

28:48.629 --> 28:49.929
Sana et mederi.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.229
Sana

28:51.262 --> 28:52.596
et mederi.

28:53.529 --> 28:56.096
I can breathe.

28:56.129 --> 28:57.229
Oh, good.

28:57.262 --> 28:59.029
Thank you.

28:59.062 --> 29:01.062
Okay, did you... did
you reverse the spell?

29:01.096 --> 29:02.529
No, I can heal an injury,

29:02.562 --> 29:04.262
but I can't undo a spell
I didn't cast.

29:04.296 --> 29:05.862
What were you thinking, Dash?

29:05.896 --> 29:09.062
I was trying to protect us
so nobody could hurt us.

29:09.096 --> 29:11.029
Here, look...

29:11.062 --> 29:13.996
Sometimes the simpler
a spell sounds,

29:14.029 --> 29:18.096
the more complicated
it really is.

29:18.129 --> 29:19.996
(sighs)

29:20.029 --> 29:21.762
(mumbling)

29:21.796 --> 29:23.529
Oh, no.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.996
What?
The spell doesn't

29:26.029 --> 29:27.929
protect you or make
you indestructible.

29:27.962 --> 29:29.696
It takes the vitality
of one organism,

29:29.729 --> 29:31.529
and it transfers
it to another.

29:33.129 --> 29:34.996
Then I'm dying.

29:35.029 --> 29:37.529
Yeah. Pretty much.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.262
So, can you fix it?

29:40.296 --> 29:41.862
No, but I can
walk you both through

29:41.896 --> 29:44.196
how to reverse it.

29:52.696 --> 29:54.762
Ivar?

29:54.796 --> 29:56.762
I brought what you want.

29:56.796 --> 29:59.962
No, you brought what you owe us.

30:01.362 --> 30:02.729
Where exactly is the portal?

30:02.762 --> 30:04.629
Wall to your right.

30:06.796 --> 30:08.529
And where's the key?

30:10.029 --> 30:11.329
It's a spell.

30:11.362 --> 30:13.096
Good luck.

30:13.129 --> 30:15.762
No. You do the spell.

30:22.796 --> 30:24.729
Satisfied?

30:24.762 --> 30:26.829
I'll be satisfied
when I'm back in Asgard.

30:26.862 --> 30:28.529
Let's go.

30:28.562 --> 30:30.396
Freya's time is running out.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.729
You're leaving without Isis?

30:31.762 --> 30:33.029
Oh, she'll be here.

30:33.062 --> 30:34.962
You just focus
on opening the portal.

30:38.796 --> 30:41.429
Venenum serpentis.

30:41.462 --> 30:43.996
(loud hissing)

30:44.029 --> 30:47.962
See you still got that thing
about snakes, Ivar.

30:48.729 --> 30:52.362
Venenum serpentis.

30:54.129 --> 30:57.429
(hissing continues)

30:59.029 --> 31:01.162
Venenum serpentis.

31:01.196 --> 31:02.896
(hissing)

31:02.929 --> 31:05.096
Fraendo!

31:07.962 --> 31:09.262
(groans)

31:13.596 --> 31:15.229
Oh.

31:15.262 --> 31:18.262
(groaning)

31:23.062 --> 31:25.562
(gasps)

31:25.596 --> 31:27.996
How's that venom feel
coursing through your veins?

31:28.029 --> 31:30.162
I just wanted to go home.

31:30.196 --> 31:33.096
(panting)

31:33.129 --> 31:35.096
You're worse than we are.

31:35.129 --> 31:37.029
You're lower than a rat.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.862
You always were.

31:38.896 --> 31:41.896
You never should have come here
and threatened my family.

31:41.929 --> 31:44.062
You know what I'm capable of.

31:44.096 --> 31:47.362
Yeah, you just killed
half your family.

31:47.396 --> 31:49.562
Yeah.

31:49.596 --> 31:51.729
But I killed you, too.

31:51.762 --> 31:54.396
(bones snap)

31:58.962 --> 32:00.929
(glasses clink)

32:02.296 --> 32:04.896
You're trying
to get me drunk?
(laughs): No!

32:04.929 --> 32:07.196
I'm trying to get me drunk,
and I'm hoping you're

32:07.229 --> 32:08.696
gonna come along
for the ride.

32:08.729 --> 32:10.229
Right on.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.562
Fortunam.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.529
More Latin?
It means "good luck."

32:13.562 --> 32:15.829
I figured we could
use a little.
Mm.

32:15.862 --> 32:18.696
I got lucky the day
I met you at the library.

32:19.896 --> 32:23.196
Wow, that is seriously sappy.
(chuckles)

32:23.229 --> 32:25.896
Oh, just shut up.

32:25.929 --> 32:27.196
(mock gasp)

32:27.229 --> 32:28.696
We're having a moment.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.062
Are we?

32:30.096 --> 32:31.229
Come here.

32:32.729 --> 32:35.096
♪ ♪

32:39.096 --> 32:40.496
You taste like peanuts.

32:40.529 --> 32:42.262
Oh, yeah, I was starving.
I grabbed a handful.

32:42.296 --> 32:43.729
It was either that
or garlic olives.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.562
I figured that I would
do you a favor.

32:45.596 --> 32:47.829
What's wrong?

32:47.862 --> 32:49.096
(hoarsely):
Highly allergic.

32:49.129 --> 32:51.029
Oh, shit!
(gasps)

32:52.196 --> 32:53.329
Oh, my God!

32:53.362 --> 32:54.862
(panting)

32:54.896 --> 32:56.696
I don't know
what I'm doing.

32:56.729 --> 32:58.829
(choking)
Oh, God, please
don't die!

32:58.862 --> 33:00.196
(grunts)

33:05.029 --> 33:06.829
INGRID:
Whatever you do,

33:06.862 --> 33:09.362
don't let go.

33:10.062 --> 33:12.829
(whispers):
Okay.

33:12.862 --> 33:15.729
Now, slowly repeat...

33:15.762 --> 33:18.262
Retexe indelebilis.

33:18.296 --> 33:21.362
Retexe
indelebilis.

33:22.629 --> 33:25.762
Retexe indelebilis.

33:25.796 --> 33:29.362
Retexe indeleb...

33:29.396 --> 33:31.862
(yelling)

33:33.396 --> 33:35.429
(yelling)

33:39.429 --> 33:42.362
Killian. Killian.

33:44.429 --> 33:46.196
(pants)

33:46.229 --> 33:47.229
Killian, hey.

33:47.262 --> 33:48.196
(laughs)

33:48.229 --> 33:49.862
(chuckles):
Killian.

33:49.896 --> 33:51.596
(laughs)

33:54.529 --> 33:56.829
(exhales)

33:56.862 --> 33:59.329
(panting)

33:59.362 --> 34:00.696
JOANNA:
The hourglass is spelled.

34:00.729 --> 34:02.262
All of this is rigged to explode

34:02.296 --> 34:04.696
as soon as you stand up
or the sand runs out.

34:04.729 --> 34:06.029
Why can't you stop it?

34:06.062 --> 34:07.762
Freya, I've tried
six different spells

34:07.796 --> 34:10.196
to try and reverse the flow‐‐
it's just moving faster.

34:10.229 --> 34:12.362
Only Isis
can stop it.
If you wait

34:12.396 --> 34:14.396
for the sand to run out,
we are all gonna die.

34:14.429 --> 34:15.896
You need to take Dad
and you need

34:15.929 --> 34:17.529
to get out of here
while you can.

34:17.562 --> 34:18.929
I'm not leaving without you.

34:18.962 --> 34:20.262
FREYA:
I will be reborn.

34:20.296 --> 34:21.729
Dad won't.
Just take him and leave!

34:21.762 --> 34:22.862
I'm not giving up.

34:22.896 --> 34:24.729
Joanna...
Just let me think!

34:24.762 --> 34:26.229
There's nothing to think about!

34:26.262 --> 34:27.596
Dad, please,
tell her to leave.

34:27.629 --> 34:30.229
Joanna, listen to me.
Loca Curis.

34:30.262 --> 34:33.096
No! Absolutely not!
Wait, what is that?

34:33.129 --> 34:36.162
It's a spell. You and I
would switch places instantly.

34:36.196 --> 34:37.496
And then you'll
be killed!

34:37.529 --> 34:39.729
Yeah, I'm not
gonna make it anyway.

34:39.762 --> 34:42.229
You will!
I could cure you!

34:42.262 --> 34:43.896
I just have to get
us out of here!

34:43.929 --> 34:45.162
It's too late
for that.

34:45.196 --> 34:46.362
Freya's never lived this long.

34:46.396 --> 34:48.496
Please... let me do this.

34:48.529 --> 34:51.496
(overlapping chatter)

34:51.529 --> 34:54.429
We're all gonna die.
You can't cure...

34:54.462 --> 34:57.196
There's nothing to think about!
Do it now!

35:01.929 --> 35:02.929
VICTOR:
Time is running out, Joanna.

35:02.962 --> 35:03.996
Just do the damn spell...

35:04.029 --> 35:06.296
and do it now!

35:07.196 --> 35:08.529
(Joanna panting)

35:08.562 --> 35:10.762
Loca Curis!

35:10.796 --> 35:13.429
(whooshing)

35:13.462 --> 35:14.962
(gasps, pants)

35:17.596 --> 35:20.829
Dad! Dad...
(quiet grunting)

35:20.862 --> 35:22.929
I love you.

35:22.962 --> 35:24.562
I love you.

35:24.596 --> 35:27.529
(whispers):
Now, go.
(sniffles)

35:27.562 --> 35:29.429
