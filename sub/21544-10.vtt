Aw, come on, a little lightning
never killed anyone.

Statistically speaking...

00:17.743 --> 00:19.760
[all gasping]

00:19.836 --> 00:22.579
See? Nothin' to worry about!

00:22.581 --> 00:27.192
[clicking] - What about
that flashing red light?

00:27.269 --> 00:30.011
Huh?

00:30.089 --> 00:32.756
That's just probably
the "everything is fine" light.

00:32.758 --> 00:35.275
Okay, but hypothetically,
what if

00:35.352 --> 00:36.421
it's the "everything
is <i> not</i> fine" light?

00:36.445 --> 00:38.653

[roars]

00:58.284 --> 00:59.616
Where are we?

00:59.618 --> 01:02.710
According to the JWG,
we're off the tip of Greece,

01:02.788 --> 01:04.638
and... wait.
This can't be right.

01:04.714 --> 01:08.049
- I thought it was a myth.
- What? What is this place?

01:08.127 --> 01:09.351
- Ithaquack.
- What?!

01:16.318 --> 01:17.801
[all gasping]

01:17.803 --> 01:19.038
- It's gorgeous!
- Look at that!

01:19.062 --> 01:20.804
No. No, no, no.

01:20.806 --> 01:21.896
We gotta go now!

01:21.974 --> 01:24.083
Get this plane in the air!

01:24.159 --> 01:25.918
Sorry, Mr. McD, gotta figure out

01:25.994 --> 01:27.978
what this flashing light means.

01:27.980 --> 01:30.071
I always say,
better safe than...

01:30.149 --> 01:32.316
whatever the opposite
of safe is.

01:32.318 --> 01:34.093
Yeah. I do say that.

01:34.169 --> 01:36.244
When have you ever said that?!

01:36.322 --> 01:37.632
Hmm. Might as well
take a look around.

01:37.656 --> 01:39.656
[cheering]

01:39.658 --> 01:41.416
- No!
- Everyone stay on the plane!

01:41.493 --> 01:44.845
- [cheering]
- Get back here!

01:44.921 --> 01:46.496
- See ya!
- Bye-bye!

01:46.498 --> 01:49.166
We're here! We did it!

01:49.168 --> 01:50.517
Yeah! Wait, why did we do that?

01:50.594 --> 01:53.687
- Dewey, this is Ithaquack.
- I'm sorry?

01:53.763 --> 01:55.614
Home of legendary
Greek artifacts?

01:55.691 --> 01:57.507
Oh, Greek... What, what, what?

01:57.509 --> 02:00.268
- Like the Spear of Selene...
- Selene! I knew it!

02:00.346 --> 02:02.788
My mom's note to Scrooge said
she took the Spear of Selene.

02:02.865 --> 02:04.957
If we can find the spear...

02:05.033 --> 02:06.350
Maybe we'll find out
what happened to her

02:06.352 --> 02:07.872
and uncover Scrooge's
greatest mystery!

02:07.944 --> 02:09.703
To the <i> naos!</i>

02:09.779 --> 02:10.963

04:44.218 --> 04:45.734
So many questions.

04:45.810 --> 04:47.288
Do you control all storms,
or just lightning?

04:47.312 --> 04:49.830
Does being immortal also
make you impervious to pain?

04:49.906 --> 04:51.981
Do you cry? [Gasps]

- What?!

[Webby] "Dear Scrooge",

"I've taken the Spear of Selene.

05:12.003 --> 05:14.095
I'm sorry. Della."

05:14.172 --> 05:16.023
We're close to the truth.
I can feel it.

05:16.099 --> 05:17.691
What if my mom explored
this very path?

05:17.768 --> 05:20.861
What if I'm literally walking
in her footsteps right now?

05:20.937 --> 05:22.270
[inhales deeply]

05:22.347 --> 05:24.347
I can still smell her feet.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.366
So we know Della
took the Spear of Selene

05:26.443 --> 05:28.201
and betrayed Mr. McDuck
and Donald.

05:28.278 --> 05:30.853
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We don't
know she did something bad.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.264
That note can mean
lots of things.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.766
"I've taken the Spear of
Selene to get cleaned."

05:34.768 --> 05:36.435
"I'm sorry I spilled soup on it."

05:36.437 --> 05:37.838
"I've taken the Spear of

I'm sorry you already had
one. "Happy Birthday!"

Oh! Or "I've taken the Spear of
Selene from your money bin",

I'm sorry
I betrayed your trust."

05:47.281 --> 05:50.390
Or... or probably
one of your things. Heh.

05:50.467 --> 05:51.207
The only way to know for sure
is in...

05:51.285 --> 05:54.119
the Temple of Heroes!

05:54.121 --> 05:56.712
"Of Heroes"? Aha!

05:56.790 --> 05:59.307
Pretty good sign
my mom wasn't a traitor.

05:59.384 --> 06:03.628
[Zeus] Ithaquack was
<i>the</i> secret vacation spot

06:03.630 --> 06:05.480
for gods and heroes.

06:05.557 --> 06:07.723
And I was
the god of hospitality.

06:07.801 --> 06:11.319
The King of the Beach!
Everyone loved me.

06:11.396 --> 06:12.971
Then Scrooge showed up.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.323
Defeated the unkillable Gorgon.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.251
Found the lost treasure of Troy.

at building sand castles.

was so cool and ruined it!

06:30.491 --> 06:32.324
Och, jings.
Leave it to an immortal

06:32.326 --> 06:34.326
to whine about
the good old days.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.327
So, where is everyone?

06:35.329 --> 06:37.753
They all left when you did.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.567
Said they didn't want
to party with a "lame god"

06:39.591 --> 06:41.108
who couldn't even best
a lowly mortal.

06:44.020 --> 06:47.689
There may have also been
a year-long lightning storm.

But now that you have returned,

and his fiery sister...

06:55.440 --> 06:56.614
Halt! Where is Della?

07:01.688 --> 07:04.280
I see.

07:04.358 --> 07:07.116
Then we shall embark upon
a rousing adventure

07:09.196 --> 07:10.953
I don't adventure anymore.

is the very blood in your veins!

Well, we must at least

- What?!

07:21.224 --> 07:24.317
Father, surely
the god of Hospitality

07:24.394 --> 07:26.769
would not cast out
a crew of weary travelers.

Well, no, I guess not.

Maybe people didn't leave
because they liked <i> me,</i>

they <i> didn't</i> like <i> you.</i>

[whistling nonchalantly]

08:04.251 --> 08:07.919
Ha-ha! Perhaps some festive beach
games will lighten the mood.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.088
Yes! A contest!

- Ah, phooey.
- Ah, phooey.

Careful! According to legend,

the artifact in this chamber

08:42.121 --> 08:44.100
holds a terrible curse
when removed from its pedestal.

been cursed by the Spear!

It's okay. Shh. It's okay.

one more time to get out.

It was all worth it to find
the Sword of Selene!

Wait, what? This isn't what we're
looking for. Where's the Spear?

09:19.843 --> 09:21.660
It's a big temple.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.103
We must have
the wrong antechamber.

09:23.179 --> 09:25.163
Then we'll just have to find
the right one.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.016
Nothing will stand in our way!

So breezy, so comfortable.

And surprisingly slimming.

09:40.196 --> 09:42.122
Storkules may have
brute strength,

09:42.198 --> 09:44.365
but he's also an idiot.

You lads can use that
to your advantage.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.186
I believe in you all!

09:48.188 --> 09:49.521
Okay, son.

09:49.523 --> 09:50.297
If you beat Scrooge's family,

I'll be back on top.

Admired. Respected.

09:53.785 --> 09:55.802
Blindly obeyed!

09:55.879 --> 09:59.806
And why do <i> you</i> not compete
directly against Scrooge?

09:59.883 --> 10:02.701
Well, obviously, people
would lose respect for me

10:02.703 --> 10:05.812
if I were to lower myself
to his level.

10:05.889 --> 10:06.721
Never mind that.

10:06.798 --> 10:07.805
To your positions!

10:12.470 --> 10:14.896
Whoever claims Aeolus's
Bag of Winds first wins.

10:14.972 --> 10:17.565
Understood?

10:17.642 --> 10:19.050
Five or six questions...

10:19.052 --> 10:20.827
On your mark, get set...
[thunder crashes]

10:20.904 --> 10:22.487
[quacks]

10:24.391 --> 10:25.573
[wind whooshing]

10:25.650 --> 10:26.658
[Donald cries out]

10:29.896 --> 10:31.336
We're never gonna beat him
like this!

10:31.398 --> 10:32.339
Too breezy! Too breezy!

10:32.415 --> 10:33.673
Idea!

10:42.333 --> 10:43.591
Ha ha ha!

10:43.668 --> 10:46.761
Well done, nephews of Donald!
What ingenuity!

10:46.838 --> 10:50.765
From henceforth, you shall be
known as Hubert, Tamer of Winds,

10:50.842 --> 10:53.175
and Llewelyn, Fighter of Storms!

10:53.253 --> 10:55.687
- Awesome!
- Please do not say my real name out loud.

10:58.516 --> 11:01.034
Heh-heh. Satisfied?

11:01.111 --> 11:02.702
Doesn't count! They cheated!

11:02.779 --> 11:03.779
Best two out of three!

11:06.266 --> 11:07.281
[roars]

11:10.103 --> 11:12.212
Ha-ha!

11:12.288 --> 11:14.622
"Scrooge, I'm taking
the Spear of Selene

11:14.699 --> 11:16.290
"to challenge
the gods of Olympus,

11:16.367 --> 11:17.920
"but will probably
be eaten by a sea monster.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.219
I'm sorry. Della."

11:19.295 --> 11:20.387
That's a possibility.

11:20.463 --> 11:22.389
- [both yell]
- [roars]

11:22.465 --> 11:24.616
You hideous monster!

11:24.618 --> 11:27.042
I will avenge my mother
by killing you

11:27.120 --> 11:28.689
with the very spear
you're sworn to protect!

11:28.713 --> 11:32.381
You shall never get
the Spear of Poseidon!

11:32.459 --> 11:33.883
I'm sorry.
The Spear of who, now?

11:33.960 --> 11:36.811
The Spear of Poseidon!

11:36.888 --> 11:39.739
Man! We got the wrong chamber
again!

11:39.816 --> 11:41.724
We're looking for
the Spear of Selene.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.803
Oh! Huh.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.988
You're gonna want to go back
down the hall,

11:47.064 --> 11:49.082
past the Harpy Aviary,
third door on your left.

11:49.159 --> 11:50.491
Garden of Selene. Can't miss it.

11:50.568 --> 11:51.584
Oh, hey, thanks.

11:54.664 --> 11:58.758
Sorry about calling you
a hideous monster before.

11:58.835 --> 12:01.486
I'm sure you're very attractive
by sea monster standards.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.838
Not really. Thanks, though.

12:07.510 --> 12:08.510
[both grunt]

12:11.498 --> 12:12.498
Yahh!

12:19.096 --> 12:21.005
Ha-ha! Huzzah!

12:21.007 --> 12:22.007
[grrrr]

12:24.177 --> 12:25.952
[horse whinnies]

12:26.029 --> 12:27.570
[Donald cries out]

12:30.183 --> 12:31.941
- [both] Whoo!
- Ha ha!

12:32.018 --> 12:33.018
[groans]

12:34.855 --> 12:35.855
Hmm.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.419
Hmm?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.625
Enough!

12:49.703 --> 12:51.811
[thunder crashes]

12:51.888 --> 12:53.721
Now comes
the ultimate challenge.

12:53.798 --> 12:55.707
Steal the golden fleece

12:55.709 --> 12:58.726
from this small child.

12:58.803 --> 13:00.394
<i>This</i> is your ultimate challenge?

13:00.471 --> 13:02.814
There's no way we're gonna beat
Storkules on this one.

13:05.309 --> 13:08.569
Steal? From a child?

13:08.646 --> 13:10.312
But if I were
to do such a thing,

13:10.390 --> 13:13.407
could I ever truly
be called a hero?

13:13.484 --> 13:15.727
Donald, I am in need
of your wise counsel.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.411
Donald?

13:17.488 --> 13:20.656
Donald!

13:20.734 --> 13:23.176
Oh! Companion Donald,
where are you going?

13:23.253 --> 13:26.087
Ah, look.
You're a nice guy, but...

13:26.163 --> 13:27.421
The most nice guy,

13:27.498 --> 13:30.591
for I am Storkules, pure of...

13:30.668 --> 13:32.593
No, no, no! I'm through
with adventure!

13:32.670 --> 13:35.246
Someone always gets hurt!

13:35.248 --> 13:37.749
But getting hurt
is part of the adventure!

13:37.751 --> 13:38.819
What would fierce Della say

13:38.843 --> 13:39.751
is she could hear you now?

13:39.753 --> 13:41.769
Well, she can't!

13:41.846 --> 13:44.364
Ahh. Someone always gets hurt.

13:48.778 --> 13:51.037
[Webby gasps]

13:51.114 --> 13:55.041
A perfect 1:125th scale replica
of Ithaquack.

13:55.118 --> 13:58.119
And look! There's a tiny chimera
on the hillside!

13:58.195 --> 14:00.271
It's so adorable
I just want to slay it!

14:00.306 --> 14:03.291
Focus. We're so close
to solving this.

14:03.367 --> 14:05.701
The truth about my mom.

14:05.779 --> 14:09.872
And one of the greatest
mysteries of Clan McDuck.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.374
So, do we look
in the tiny houses, or...?

14:12.452 --> 14:14.786
[loud clank]

14:14.788 --> 14:15.970
[whirring]

14:22.887 --> 14:25.387
[rumbling]

14:25.465 --> 14:26.965
[both gasp]

14:26.967 --> 14:28.087
[both] The Garden of Selene!

14:29.727 --> 14:31.578
What's it say?

14:31.654 --> 14:32.798
That Della Duck was a hero
who died nobly

14:32.822 --> 14:34.472
trying to protect her family?

14:34.474 --> 14:36.808
"Whomsoever
claims the prize inside

14:36.810 --> 14:38.918
"shall find great riches,

14:38.995 --> 14:41.162
but incur the terrible
wrath of the gods."

14:41.238 --> 14:43.664
[gasps] It all checks out!

14:43.741 --> 14:45.149
Della stole the spear,
angered the gods,

14:45.151 --> 14:48.169
and brought their wrath down
upon her innocent family,

14:48.245 --> 14:49.389
which explains why
Mr. McDuck and Donald

14:49.413 --> 14:51.097
didn't want to land here. Ha!

14:51.174 --> 14:53.266
That can't be true.

14:53.343 --> 14:54.653
My mom would never
do that to her family.

14:54.677 --> 14:57.419
[stone moving]

14:57.497 --> 14:59.497
I guess we'll find out
for sure in the garden.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.499
Let's go!

15:01.684 --> 15:05.427
No.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.448
- What are you doing?! The door is closing!
- We're not going in.

15:08.524 --> 15:12.434
But all the answers we've been
searching for are in there!

15:12.512 --> 15:14.236
I don't care! My mom was a hero!

15:20.520 --> 15:22.186
If I do not steal the fleece,
Father shall be incensed.

15:22.188 --> 15:25.356
But if I steal
from a small, innocent child,

15:25.358 --> 15:27.116
how can I ever
face myself again?

15:27.193 --> 15:28.801
Just grab it already!!!

15:28.878 --> 15:30.361
- I got it!
- Louie!

15:30.363 --> 15:34.382
What? I'm also a little kid.
It's fine.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.217
- [sings haunting melody]
- Plug your ears!

15:36.293 --> 15:38.536
No good ever came
from a creepy child singing!

15:38.538 --> 15:41.222
[continues singing]

15:46.896 --> 15:51.883
Oh! The child is actually
a mind-controlling siren!

15:51.885 --> 15:53.826
Did I not mention that?

15:53.903 --> 15:56.554
Storkules, finish them!

15:56.556 --> 15:58.890
[siren continues singing]

15:58.892 --> 15:59.892
Uh-oh!

16:02.578 --> 16:04.003
- Ahh!
- Aah!

16:04.080 --> 16:07.081
Please! The answers
are right through there!

16:07.158 --> 16:09.491
- You can't stop me now!
- Don't have to.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.449
Just have to hold you off
until the door closes!

16:11.495 --> 16:14.088
You wouldn't!

16:14.165 --> 16:15.907
I'll save you, tiny chimera!

16:15.909 --> 16:19.018
No! My fists betray my heart!

16:19.095 --> 16:22.596
Father! Stop this madness!

16:22.673 --> 16:24.173
Mm-hmm?

16:24.250 --> 16:25.599
[grunts]

16:25.676 --> 16:27.601
[all cry out]

16:27.678 --> 16:30.179
Just lay off, man!

16:30.256 --> 16:32.418
It's not my fault I best you at
pretty much everything I do!

16:32.442 --> 16:33.442
Not helping!

16:35.595 --> 16:36.795
Let me through, you no-good...

16:36.854 --> 16:37.929
- [crackles]
- Aaaah!

16:37.931 --> 16:39.280
Never... aaah!

16:39.356 --> 16:40.781
Adventure... ow!

16:40.858 --> 16:42.934
Again! Aaah!

16:42.936 --> 16:45.027
- [Huey/Louie] Help!
- What?!

16:45.105 --> 16:47.271
[stammering]

16:47.273 --> 16:51.533
I must apologize in advance
for crushing your tiny bodies.

16:51.611 --> 16:55.537
I want you to know that as my
best friend Donald's family,

16:55.615 --> 16:57.276
I consider you my
second-tier best friends.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.467
Farewell!

16:59.543 --> 17:01.043
[Donald] Hey, you big palooka!

17:01.121 --> 17:04.637
Nobody gets hurt today!

17:04.714 --> 17:07.474
[both grunting]

17:07.550 --> 17:08.568
Aaah!

17:08.644 --> 17:10.644
- Ha!
- Aaah!

17:10.721 --> 17:12.405
Ha-ha! Whoa!

17:12.482 --> 17:13.482
Dodge!

17:15.059 --> 17:17.226
[quacking]

17:17.303 --> 17:19.746
I'm gonna get my hands on you!

17:19.821 --> 17:23.324
- [quacking]
- [grunting]

17:23.400 --> 17:26.902
We're so close to the truth!
Why won't you let us find it?!

17:26.980 --> 17:30.072
Because...

17:30.150 --> 17:31.832
what if my mom was a bad person?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.247
- Okay.
- What?

17:38.324 --> 17:41.342
This is one mystery
we don't have to solve.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.386
Hmm.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.183
[both grunt]

17:53.523 --> 17:55.203
I need to know the truth...
Whatever it is.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.179
[both] Aaah!

18:01.181 --> 18:02.789
Ha! Gotcha!

18:02.865 --> 18:05.199
Heeeey, you're not Della.

18:05.276 --> 18:06.608
You know Della? Where is she?

18:06.686 --> 18:09.203
Please tell me she wasn't
an evil family betrayer

18:09.280 --> 18:10.800
and spear stealer!
Who are you, anyway?

18:10.873 --> 18:12.799
Dewey, that's Selene,

18:12.875 --> 18:14.692
the goddess of the moon.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.527
Hi, I'm Webby.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.138
I heard Scrooge and his family
were on the island,

18:19.215 --> 18:21.715
so I wrote a super-spooky
prophecy on the door

18:21.792 --> 18:23.050
to lure my friend Della.

18:23.127 --> 18:24.885
It usually does the trick.

18:24.962 --> 18:26.365
So, where's
the Spear of Selene, Selene?

18:26.389 --> 18:28.815
- What spear?
- The one Della took from your garden.

18:28.891 --> 18:30.891
You mean the Sphere of Selene?

18:30.968 --> 18:32.634
Why does no one
get what I'm saying?!

18:32.712 --> 18:35.563
The <i> Spear</i> of Selene!

18:35.639 --> 18:37.215
I've never had a spear.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.659
Do you mean the Sword of Selene?
That's down the hall...

18:39.735 --> 18:43.387
No! The Spear of Selene!
The one my mom took!

18:43.389 --> 18:44.716
The one that's our only clue
to finding her!

18:44.740 --> 18:47.391
Ah, your Della's kid!

18:47.393 --> 18:49.818
I shoulda realized...
You're just like her.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.987
I'm sorry. I haven't
seen her in years,

18:52.065 --> 18:55.490
and I don't know what
the Spear of Selene is.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.343
So we're back to
"she stole Scrooge's spear

18:57.420 --> 18:58.736
"and betrayed the family" then.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.238
- Great.
- What? No way!

19:00.240 --> 19:02.907
She loved her family more
than anything in the world.

19:02.909 --> 19:07.502
Della wasn't just a good person,
she was the greatest.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.689
And she made
everyone around her better.

19:09.765 --> 19:12.024
Maybe the spear
isn't an artifact.

19:12.101 --> 19:14.360
Maybe it's something else!

19:14.437 --> 19:16.362
Your mom did love
a good mystery.

19:16.439 --> 19:18.347
Here. It's not a spear,

19:18.424 --> 19:20.682
but it is a treasure

19:20.760 --> 19:24.019
even Della never found.

19:24.097 --> 19:25.446
Don't give up, young duck.

19:25.522 --> 19:26.522
Your mother never did.

19:27.783 --> 19:28.783
Mmm.

19:31.771 --> 19:32.771
Mmm.

19:34.607 --> 19:39.385
[quacking] - Know that I
regret this most bitterly.

19:41.205 --> 19:43.964
Seems like old times, eh, lad?

19:44.041 --> 19:45.283
- [siren singing]
- Yeah!

19:45.285 --> 19:47.894
- We gotta stop the singing!
- I'm on it.

19:47.970 --> 19:50.730
[singing in ancient language]

19:50.806 --> 19:53.457
What a magical voice!

19:53.459 --> 19:55.643
Do you have any idea
how much money I could make

19:55.719 --> 19:57.478
on a voice like yours?

19:57.554 --> 19:59.888
Zeus just wants to use you.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.633
I want to use you
to make us <i> both</i> rich.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.635
What do you say?

20:05.805 --> 20:08.730
[low, gruff voice]
You've got a deal.

20:08.808 --> 20:09.749
Great.

20:09.825 --> 20:12.310
[both grunting]

20:12.312 --> 20:13.902
Huh?

20:13.980 --> 20:16.997
Donald! You have saved me!

20:17.074 --> 20:19.650
Oh-ho-ho! Come here.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.146
Don't hug the enemy!
What are you doing?!

20:21.170 --> 20:23.930
They're best friends.

20:24.006 --> 20:26.006
Acquaintances!

20:26.083 --> 20:30.328
Perhaps we've been letting our
pride get in the way for decades

20:30.330 --> 20:32.438
and it's our families
who suffer.

20:32.515 --> 20:33.764
What do you say? Peace?

20:36.927 --> 20:39.094
Does beating me
really mean that much to you?

20:39.172 --> 20:41.172
Yes, absolutely.

20:41.174 --> 20:43.841
Oh, fine. One final challenge.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.526
Winner gets all the glory.

20:53.186 --> 20:58.689
Oh, I... oh, I cannae believe
I choked on the last round.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.300
Yes! I win!

21:01.377 --> 21:03.043
In your face, McDuck!

21:13.873 --> 21:15.373
You may think
you're done with adventure,

21:15.375 --> 21:18.542
but it will never
be done with you.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.469
You're a hero,

21:20.546 --> 21:22.637
whether you want to be or not.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.566
I do not. But thanks,
friend Storkules.

21:25.642 --> 21:29.161
He called me his friend!
He said it back! Ha ha!

21:29.238 --> 21:32.823
This is the most glorious day
of my entire life!

21:34.394 --> 21:35.817
There you two are.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.561
Right, let's get back
to the plane

21:37.563 --> 21:39.913
before he comes up with
another cockamamie contest.

21:39.990 --> 21:42.824
Thanks for pushing me
back there.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.068
I promise I'll never stop
until we find the truth.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.904
With this sphere
as my witness, I...

21:46.906 --> 21:48.005
Ohh, no!

21:52.245 --> 21:54.186
- No!!!

21:54.263 --> 21:56.263
The wrath of the gods!

21:56.340 --> 21:58.190
We should go <i> now.</i>

22:00.436 --> 22:02.436
Okay. I think I found
the problem.
