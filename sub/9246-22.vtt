WEBVTT

00:04.134 --> 00:05.962
Thanks for taking us
out tonight, you guys.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.747
It's a nice little break
from all the wedding chaos.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.749
Trust me, girl, with all
your relatives in town

00:10.836 --> 00:12.316
it's only gonna get worse.

00:12.403 --> 00:13.926
Tell me about it,
I'm guessing I'll be spending

00:14.014 --> 00:16.103
most of the reception trying
to keep my mom's foot

00:16.190 --> 00:18.801
out of my dad's ass.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.194
Which reminds me,
we have to call the caterer

00:20.281 --> 00:21.630
and have them switch
from steak knives

00:21.717 --> 00:23.371
to butter knives.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.155
Why not play it safe
and go all plastic?

00:25.242 --> 00:28.028
Nah, my mom can make
a shiv out of anything.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.160
We should just serve soup
and tear your own bread.

00:30.247 --> 00:33.555
And cold soup, something
that won't blister a face.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.209
Just so you know,
whatever you guys need

00:35.296 --> 00:36.862
Christina and I are there
for you, right, baby?

00:36.949 --> 00:38.908
Of course, the biggest
mistake my ex-husband

00:38.995 --> 00:40.431
and I made was letting
ourselves get caught up

00:40.518 --> 00:42.129
in everybody else's crazy.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.566
Well, this is my wedding,
and that means nobody else

00:44.653 --> 00:45.828
gets to be crazier than me.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.265
El Loco Grande.

00:48.352 --> 00:51.921
Si, senorita. Muy, muy loco.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.531
By the way, did you decide
where you're sleeping

00:53.618 --> 00:54.576
tomorrow night?

00:54.663 --> 00:56.056
She's testing me.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.666
Right by your side, baby.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.189
No, you're not.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.277
It's the night before
the wedding, you have

01:00.364 --> 01:01.800
to stay somewhere else.

01:01.887 --> 01:04.934
- Why?
- Because it's tradition.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.632
One night apart
before we're joined together

01:07.719 --> 01:09.025
you know, for the rest
of our lives.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.505
Plus, at the crack
of dawn, that house

01:10.592 --> 01:11.897
is gonna be filled
with nervous women

01:11.984 --> 01:13.247
drinking mimosas,
primping, plucking

01:13.334 --> 01:14.726
and snapping at each other.

01:14.813 --> 01:17.120
Carl, I'm stayin'
at your house tomorrow night.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.079
Well, that's fine
with me, but my grandma

01:19.166 --> 01:20.776
has her Christian
senior domino club over

01:20.863 --> 01:22.430
and that's not the place
to be if you're trying

01:22.517 --> 01:24.171
to avoid spiteful women
with a snoot full.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.478
Why don't you stay
with your mom?

01:27.565 --> 01:29.698
Maybe the same reason
I don't chew on tin foil

01:29.785 --> 01:31.917
or try to kiss bears.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.528
Come on,
it'd mean a lot to her

01:33.615 --> 01:35.443
to have her little boy
there on his last night

01:35.530 --> 01:37.271
of being an unmarried man.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.403
Boy, you really want me
to run screaming

01:39.490 --> 01:41.144
down that aisle, don't you?

01:41.231 --> 01:43.668
A sense of urgency
would be nice.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.670
Anything for you, my bride.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.542
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.894
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Yes, it is.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.637
I love you, Christina.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.204
Aw!

01:57.291 --> 01:58.814
That's sweet.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.821
♪ For the first time ♪

02:05.908 --> 02:07.910
♪ In my life ♪

02:09.346 --> 02:11.131
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:25.754 --> 02:26.885
Sweetie,
if there's anything else

02:26.972 --> 02:28.844
you need me to do, just ask.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.238
Okay, talk to you later.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.240
You, too.

02:33.327 --> 02:35.764
I can't.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.722
Yes, he is.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.378
Alright.

02:41.465 --> 02:44.076
Love you too.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.948
No, I don't think he heard.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.213
- Molly says "Hi."
- Uh-huh.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.565
I can't believe Christina
left me hangin' like that.

02:54.652 --> 02:57.264
What are you talking about?

02:57.351 --> 02:59.483
Y-you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.355
I told that woman
I loved her laid my heart out

03:01.442 --> 03:02.399
in front of her
and she chopped it up

03:02.486 --> 03:05.489
like we were at Benihana's.

03:05.576 --> 03:06.882
Well,
maybe she didn't hear you.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.797
Please!
The whole restaurant heard me.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.755
The busboy gave me a hug
on the way out.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.932
You put her on the spot,
and even if she did

03:14.019 --> 03:16.196
feel that way, she was probably
too embarrassed to say it.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.762
I wasn't too embarrassed
to say it until

03:17.849 --> 03:19.460
she didn't say it back,
then I wanted to roll up

03:19.547 --> 03:22.941
the tablecloth and hang
myself from a chandelier.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.074
You certainly covered it well
by telling the waiter

03:25.161 --> 03:27.642
all of his dessert
selections were stupid.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.079
Hey, she didn't have to come
out and say the actual words.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.863
I would have been fine
with a me too

03:31.950 --> 03:34.388
or a ditto or a aye-aye,
Captain Dreamboat.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.001
Well, if it's any
consolation, I love ya.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.224
- See how it feels?
- Aah!

03:48.532 --> 03:50.491
So this is what you meant
by your good black suit?

03:54.321 --> 03:57.062
It's 100 percent Angus.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.803
This baby retailed
for two grand.

03:58.890 --> 04:01.937
I got it for 300 smackers
and a crate of Canadian Tylenol.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.723
You think it's a good idea
for a man who sweats

04:05.810 --> 04:08.204
the way you do to be wrapped
in a sausage casing?

04:10.119 --> 04:11.642
I'll be fine,
I took a leather punch

04:11.729 --> 04:13.557
and ventilated the crotch.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.691
Is that the suit
you're planning on walking me

04:16.778 --> 04:17.779
down the aisle in?

04:17.866 --> 04:18.910
What do you think?

04:18.997 --> 04:20.172
I think you need to give it back

04:20.260 --> 04:22.262
to the cow and apologize.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.308
Well, they didn't actually
live long enough

04:25.395 --> 04:26.744
to be considered cows.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.225
- Technically, it's a veal suit.
- Oh!

04:30.618 --> 04:32.489
Mom, I did this
as a favor for you

04:32.576 --> 04:34.056
but I'm not walking down
the aisle with a guy

04:34.143 --> 04:36.101
dressed like a gay hitman.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.238
Vince, you're gonna have
to find something else.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.066
When am I gonna get
a chance to wear this?

04:44.153 --> 04:46.590
-

04:48.026 --> 04:49.550
Why you driving
yourself so crazy?

04:49.637 --> 04:51.726
The only thing people
remember about a wedding

04:51.813 --> 04:53.684
is the dried chicken
and which bridesmaid

04:53.771 --> 04:56.992
got drunk
and flashed her cans.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.299
That reminds me, make sure
Victoria wears a bra.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.912
I'll do my best, but it's
like keeping a hat on a dog.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.656
You better get used to this,
you know, we're gonna

05:08.743 --> 05:10.353
go through the same thing
when we get hitched.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.398
What are you talkin'
about, you said

05:11.485 --> 05:12.747
you didn't want a big wedding.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.749
Well, my first one
was with a justice

05:14.836 --> 05:15.967
of the peace
and now I'm thinkin'

05:16.054 --> 05:18.274
I'd like a nice
church ceremony.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.972
Hey, let those kids blow
their money on wedding crap.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.148
For geezers like us,
I'd rather save it

05:23.235 --> 05:26.326
for something practical,
like new hips or an RV.

05:28.589 --> 05:31.069
He is gonna need
a hip replacement soon.

05:31.156 --> 05:34.029
Oh, so much of him
needs to be replaced.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.121
This is gorgeous, Andre.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.992
I look like
a portly James Bond.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.344
Double-X Seven.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.435
Yeah, normally
I look pretty hideous

05:48.522 --> 05:51.960
in formal wear,
but purr, kitty, purr.

05:54.136 --> 05:55.529
Well, here
at Andre's Big and Tall

05:55.616 --> 05:57.835
everybody walks out
with a smile.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.402
And not just because
of the free Tootsie roll

05:59.489 --> 06:02.362
we hide in every pocket.

06:02.449 --> 06:05.060
- Cool!
- Excellent!

06:05.147 --> 06:06.975
Hey, I'm telling you,
I didn't even bring it up

06:07.062 --> 06:08.977
with Christina in the car.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.239
And when she tried to engage

06:10.326 --> 06:12.110
I just gave her
short one-word answers.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.852
I see, so you were pouting
like little baby bitch.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.335
No, I was maintaining
my dignity like a man.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.381
Who was pouting
like a little baby bitch.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.559
See, I open up to you
and all you do is make jokes.

06:25.646 --> 06:29.519
- I love you, Carl.
- Shut up!

06:29.606 --> 06:31.521
Well, looks like
we're gonna have to find

06:31.608 --> 06:33.784
something for you fellas
in our boys' department.

06:35.917 --> 06:39.094
You're probably
a husky medium

06:39.181 --> 06:41.183
and I'm guessing
you're a tall, small.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.582
Kind of a bummer
not being able to find

06:48.669 --> 06:50.061
clothes that fit, huh?

06:50.148 --> 06:51.672
Who's the freak now?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.676
Take it easy, Harry.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.330
They are visitors
to our plus-sized planet.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.944
Sorry, I got a little
full of myself

07:03.031 --> 07:05.468
but seriously,
I'm sweet syrup

07:05.555 --> 07:07.209
in an Aunt Jemima bottle.

07:09.037 --> 07:11.692
Carl, you need to let
this whole Christina thing go.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.084
At least until after
we get through the wedding.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.043
Hey, I'm not gonna
bring it up at all.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.523
In fact, I'm gonna
ice her completely out

07:16.610 --> 07:17.872
and flirt with Molly's sister.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.656
No, you're not,
I got enough to worry about

07:19.743 --> 07:21.179
trying to keep my mom
and dad from turnin'

07:21.266 --> 07:23.268
that rehearsal
into a bloodbath.

07:23.355 --> 07:26.010
Besides, I plan on being
all over Molly's pothead sister

07:26.097 --> 07:28.448
like a warlord
on a UN food drop.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.148
Listen, buster,
her name's Victoria

07:33.235 --> 07:35.324
and you can consider her
off-limits.

07:35.411 --> 07:36.891
I'll trade you
my complimentary Tootsie Roll.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.502
You can't buy me
with a Tootsie Roll.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.765
Ten Tootsie Rolls.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.246
Show 'em to me.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.031
Guys!

07:47.118 --> 07:49.207
Nobody's got dibs on anyone

07:49.294 --> 07:50.992
nobody's icing anyone out.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.036
You're gonna be
on your best behavior

07:52.123 --> 07:53.081
because this is my wedding

07:53.168 --> 07:54.299
and it's gonna be beautiful

07:54.386 --> 07:56.084
magical, and filled with love.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.303
Maybe not so much for you.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.350
That's it.
Somebody hold my big coat.

08:01.437 --> 08:02.438
- I'll get him! Kill him!
- Oh, you want it?

08:02.525 --> 08:04.222
Kill him! Kill him!

08:06.703 --> 08:08.400
Son, I know you're nervous

08:08.488 --> 08:10.011
but I've performed
100 of these weddings

08:10.098 --> 08:11.142
and trust me when I tell you

08:11.229 --> 08:12.970
everything will be fine
tomorrow.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.929
I'm not worried about tomorrow,
I'm worried about tonight.

08:15.016 --> 08:17.366
This place is a powder keg
and each one of these nuts

08:17.453 --> 08:20.325
has a pocket full of matches.

08:20.412 --> 08:23.111
Now, Marcus, you know,
I'm singing two songs, right?

08:23.198 --> 08:25.069
One as people
are filing in and one

08:25.156 --> 08:27.071
after the, I do's.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.291
Uh, Sister Rosetta, I'm aware

08:29.378 --> 08:31.946
of the order of events,
and I would prefer

08:32.033 --> 08:34.078
that you address me
as Brother Heywood

08:34.165 --> 08:35.210
when I'm at work.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.517
Well, forgive me,
Brother Heywood.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.129
Oh, and would you
tell Marcus he left

08:41.216 --> 08:43.914
his suspenders hanging
on my doorknob this morning.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.267
What can I say?

08:49.354 --> 08:51.966
I got God in my heart
and the Devil in my pants.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.189
Alright.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.801
'Could the usher
please bring down'

09:00.888 --> 09:02.150
'the mother of the groom?'

09:02.237 --> 09:04.021
Mrs. Biggs, it's showtime.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.762
One, step together.

09:05.849 --> 09:08.112
- Two, step together.
- Slow down, Chumley.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.723
I'm dropping
three bills on a dress

09:09.810 --> 09:11.115
and 75 on a girdle.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.943
Let the people soak it in.

09:18.209 --> 09:21.125
And you'll sit the mother
of the groom next to the father.

09:21.212 --> 09:24.085
When Jesus climbs off his cross
and does the Macarena.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.568
Everything doesn't have
to be about you, Margaret.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.787
Now grab some wood
and pipe down.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.572
Your days of bossin'
me around are over

09:32.659 --> 09:35.226
you slack-jawed bastard.

09:35.313 --> 09:38.360
Mom, house of God.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.928
If you'd shut your pie hole
and get on with this

09:41.015 --> 09:43.321
I could be sitting at
Wrigley Field sipping a beer.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.062
Why don't you sit
on an El track

09:45.149 --> 09:48.936
with a bellyful
of sleeping pills!

09:49.023 --> 09:50.546
Just put him on my side!

09:51.982 --> 09:53.854
Dad, just move over
to Molly's side.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.859
Fine!

09:58.946 --> 10:01.122
Eyeball me again,
I'll rip off Fatty's arm

10:01.209 --> 10:03.385
and beat you
to death with it.

10:06.518 --> 10:08.825
Mom, sit!

10:08.912 --> 10:12.002
'And, uh, now the mother
of the bride.'

10:12.089 --> 10:13.569
Isn't this beautiful?

10:13.656 --> 10:15.049
I don't think Vince and I
are too old

10:15.136 --> 10:16.920
for a traditional wedding.
Do you?

10:17.007 --> 10:19.793
Oh, God, no. You're still
a very vibrant woman.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.838
When I look at you,
I can only imagine

10:21.925 --> 10:24.536
how radiant Victoria
will be when she's 70.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.017
- Seventy?
- Aw!

10:28.105 --> 10:30.368
I can walk myself from here.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.720
Oh, God, her tiny elbows
are like knives.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.593
And now the bridesmaid
and groomsman

10:37.680 --> 10:40.857
'followed by the best man
and the maid of honor.'

10:40.944 --> 10:42.511
Do you know
what's going on with Carl?

10:42.598 --> 10:45.209
He hasn't said two words
to me since we got here.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.429
Hard to say.

10:47.516 --> 10:51.085
Carl is very childish
in many ways.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.348
Yeah, well, I wish
he'd talk to me instead of--

10:53.435 --> 10:55.872
Pouting like
a little baby bitch?

10:57.352 --> 10:59.920
- Exactly.
- What's he saying?

11:00.007 --> 11:01.486
Can you hear
what he's sayin'?

11:01.573 --> 11:04.228
I think he just called
her a bitch.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.839
Good.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.408
And now the organist
will begin playing

11:10.495 --> 11:11.801
"Here Comes the Bride"

11:11.888 --> 11:14.021
and she does.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.850
[sighs]
Alright, big smile

11:16.937 --> 11:19.635
pretend I'm not smelling
salami and Aqua Velva.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.552
You need to tell your mom
to back off.

11:23.639 --> 11:26.424
I don't know why she's been
getting so wedding-crazy lately.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.817
And during
the actual ceremony

11:27.904 --> 11:29.297
we're goin' elevator rules

11:29.384 --> 11:30.777
eyes forward, mouth shut.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.300
I'm not saying,
I don't wanna get married.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.432
I just got a few loose ends
I need to tie up first.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.869
Why are you
tellin' me all this?

11:35.956 --> 11:37.218
Why don't you just tell her?

11:37.305 --> 11:39.350
How can I tell my fiancee
I'm still married?

11:40.874 --> 11:44.181
- What?
- He said he's still married.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.228
You son of a bitch!

11:47.315 --> 11:48.838
Sweetie, come on,
you know I love you.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.666
- Joyce, let me explain, please.
- Mom?

11:50.753 --> 11:52.537
- Mommy?
- Mom? Mom!

11:56.193 --> 11:58.543
We're all still going
to The Olive Garden, aren't we?

12:05.986 --> 12:07.422
Come on, Red.
Can't we talk about this?

12:07.509 --> 12:09.293
Go talk to your wife!

12:09.380 --> 12:12.296
I told you, I haven't seen
that broad for 15 years.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.211
Well, you better find her
again, 'cause you're gonna need

12:14.298 --> 12:16.300
a place to live.

12:16.387 --> 12:19.913
The night before my wedding's
turning out fun, huh?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.002
You been sitting
on this info all this time?

12:22.089 --> 12:23.960
I could never seem
to find the perfect moment

12:24.047 --> 12:26.702
to introduce the topic.

12:26.789 --> 12:27.834
Well, you sure nailed it,
you know what

12:27.921 --> 12:29.096
I have to hit you in the face.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.706
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:30.793 --> 12:33.535
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
honey, honey, honey!

12:33.622 --> 12:35.015
Now, go upstairs
and take care of your mom

12:35.102 --> 12:36.494
and I'll handle this.

12:36.581 --> 12:37.669
You're gonna kill him, right?

12:37.757 --> 12:38.932
Please tell me
you're gonna kill him.

12:39.019 --> 12:42.326
If I say yes,
it's premeditated.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.024
Smart. I love you.

12:44.111 --> 12:46.113
Make it hurt.

12:47.941 --> 12:48.898
What the hell
were you thinkin'?

12:48.985 --> 12:50.900
What, it was a drunken fling

12:50.987 --> 12:52.336
that ended after three weeks

12:52.423 --> 12:54.295
and I've been spending
the last 15 years

12:54.382 --> 12:56.253
trying to get her
to sign the divorce papers.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.342
So why didn't you tell Joyce
about this before?

12:58.429 --> 13:00.780
I thought I could take care
of it before it became an issue

13:00.867 --> 13:05.088
but thanks to you, now
everybody's got wedding fever.

13:06.568 --> 13:07.787
That's true,
I'll bet that's why I said

13:07.874 --> 13:11.138
"I love you" way too soon.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.793
Look, in two days,
you can both blame me

13:13.880 --> 13:15.098
for your messed up lives.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.144
But right now,
we need to fix this.

13:17.231 --> 13:20.321
I, I'm gonna go talk to Joyce.
I'll smooth this over.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.018
The wedding will go off
without a hitch.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.499
[Joyce]
'Get him and his crap
out of here!'

13:28.416 --> 13:30.940
Perhaps the wounds
are still too fresh.

13:37.686 --> 13:38.818
[knock on door]

13:40.602 --> 13:42.996
Mom finally fell asleep
and she didn't even finish

13:43.083 --> 13:45.215
her second bottle of wine.

13:45.302 --> 13:46.826
Had to slip it out
of her grip and replace it

13:46.913 --> 13:48.305
with a soup can.

13:49.393 --> 13:52.092
Give it.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.355
Kinda figured you'd be
in a drinking mood.

13:54.442 --> 13:55.660
I thought the night
before my wedding

13:55.747 --> 13:57.053
I'd get to be the crazy one.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.621
I didn't even make
the top ten today.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.756
Well, if it makes you
feel any better

14:04.844 --> 14:07.803
the church looks beautiful.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.153
Christina and I hung
all the ribbons

14:10.240 --> 14:13.200
and arranged all the flowers.

14:13.287 --> 14:16.594
Thanks for doing that.
You're a good maid of honor.

14:16.681 --> 14:19.989
Which reminds me,
got a little something for you.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.208
What?

14:21.295 --> 14:24.733
I was gonna give it
to you tomorrow

14:24.820 --> 14:27.649
but I thought you might need
a little cheering up.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.825
Oh, the garter.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.523
I had it made for you

14:32.610 --> 14:34.656
from one of dad's old
silk ties.

14:36.745 --> 14:39.008
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:39.095 --> 14:43.273
Old, new, borrowed, and blue

14:43.360 --> 14:45.449
in one convenient package.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.627
That's so sweet.

14:49.714 --> 14:52.456
So, in just a little way..

14:52.543 --> 14:55.198
...dad will kinda be walking
with you down the aisle.

14:58.288 --> 15:01.552
I'm so happy you're my sister.

15:01.639 --> 15:04.381
Me too.

15:04.468 --> 15:07.167
Will you please wear
a bra tomorrow?

15:15.697 --> 15:17.177
[Vince]
Listen,
it was a long time ago

15:17.264 --> 15:19.744
and I got swept up in the whole
May December romance.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.833
Who knew she was gonna
turn into such a vindictive

15:21.921 --> 15:23.487
ball-breaker?

15:23.574 --> 15:24.706
Well, what happened
the last time you tried

15:24.793 --> 15:25.750
to get her
to sign the papers?

15:25.837 --> 15:27.230
She kicked me in the nuts.

15:27.317 --> 15:29.145
What part of ball-breaker
don't you understand?

15:31.626 --> 15:33.106
Have you ever thought
that maybe she was hurt

15:33.193 --> 15:34.411
because you didn't return
her love?

15:34.498 --> 15:37.284
Carl, one problem at a time,
okay?

15:37.371 --> 15:38.850
Here it is.

15:40.591 --> 15:43.116
Now, just be nice, introduce me
and I'll do the talkin'.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.900
[Francine]
'Who the hell is it?'

15:44.987 --> 15:47.294
Look through the peephole,
you bug-eyed bitch!

15:47.381 --> 15:48.817
Vince!

15:51.820 --> 15:54.605
Brought your goons, huh,
Moranto?

15:54.692 --> 15:55.911
How old is she?

15:55.998 --> 15:57.565
I told you,
it was May December.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.871
I'm the May.

15:59.959 --> 16:00.960
Yeah, but she's not December.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.527
She's the following July.

16:03.614 --> 16:06.139
Fifteen years ago,
she was a very doable 60.

16:06.226 --> 16:09.055
Look, I told you the only way

16:09.142 --> 16:11.840
you're gonna get my signature
on those papers

16:11.927 --> 16:13.668
is over my dead body.

16:13.755 --> 16:16.366
That could take months!

16:16.453 --> 16:18.107
He's getting married tomorrow.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.457
Vince, shut up!

16:20.544 --> 16:23.939
Listen, uh, Mrs. Moranto

16:24.026 --> 16:27.682
your husband is engaged
to my future mother-in-law.

16:27.769 --> 16:30.554
Found another
trusting sap to fall

16:30.641 --> 16:32.469
for your swarthy good looks

16:32.556 --> 16:34.950
and sophisticated charms, huh?

16:35.037 --> 16:37.257
Yeah, and I love her,
Francine.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.259
So release me
from your witch's curse

16:39.346 --> 16:41.087
and sign the damn papers!

16:41.174 --> 16:42.914
Vince, heel!

16:43.002 --> 16:45.743
He batted those
beautiful long lashes

16:45.830 --> 16:47.832
at me and time stood still.

16:47.919 --> 16:51.140
Not according
to your liver spots.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.229
You know what it's like
to love someone

16:53.316 --> 16:55.405
and not have them
love you back?

16:55.492 --> 16:58.060
- Do I?
- Here we go.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.366
It's humiliating.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.932
They don't return
your affections

17:01.020 --> 17:02.412
and you wanna punish 'em,
and yet you love 'em

17:02.499 --> 17:04.197
too much to ever wish
any real harm on 'em.

17:04.284 --> 17:07.939
Well, that's where
you and I differ.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.464
Look, I'm sorry that things
went wrong between you two

17:10.551 --> 17:12.379
but maybe you should
just sign these papers

17:12.466 --> 17:13.902
so you can get on
with the rest your life.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.470
- What's left of it.
- Vince.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.300
What do you say?

17:20.387 --> 17:21.692
Same thing I been saying

17:21.779 --> 17:23.868
for the last 15 years.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.610
I'm not signin'
anything till he pays me

17:26.697 --> 17:28.569
the ten grand he owes me.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.092
You owe her ten grand?

17:30.179 --> 17:32.138
I borrowed two,
and she's been doubling

17:32.225 --> 17:34.444
the vig annually for 15 years

17:34.531 --> 17:36.490
which is a nice way
to treat your husband.

17:36.577 --> 17:39.667
- You took my youth!
- I never saw your youth!

17:39.754 --> 17:42.713
The man who took your youth
was wearing a powdered wig!

17:42.800 --> 17:44.106
Vince!

17:48.806 --> 17:50.460
- Would you take 3000?
- Eight.

17:50.547 --> 17:51.896
Five, and you can kick him
in the nuts again.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.333
Deal.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.161
Get out your checkbook
and take a deep breath.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.685
- Let me change shoes.
- Okay.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.607
[sighs]

18:08.870 --> 18:11.612
- Oh! What are you doing here?
- I hope you don't mind.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.135
Apparently, there's
a tradition that the bride

18:13.222 --> 18:14.267
and groom have to sleep apart

18:14.354 --> 18:15.442
the night before the wedding.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.270
Pfft, tradition
is not shacking up

18:17.357 --> 18:18.488
before you're married.

18:18.575 --> 18:19.837
They used to check the brides

18:19.924 --> 18:21.709
to make sure
they were still virgins.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.928
Whole town knew
if she had her hymen.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.846
Simpler times, huh, mom?

18:30.935 --> 18:33.460
Well, it's been a long day..

18:33.547 --> 18:35.418
...and I just wanna get
some sleep.

18:35.505 --> 18:38.073
Quite a dust-up
at the rehearsal tonight, huh?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.770
Yeah, it's fine.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.903
Vince is going over
there now to mend fences

18:41.990 --> 18:44.558
and ice his privates.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.429
Hoo, I hope you know
what you're doing

18:46.516 --> 18:48.779
marrying into a crazy family
like that.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.742
I had my money on you and dad
binge the main event.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.222
Happy to be wrong.

18:56.309 --> 18:58.920
[Jack]
'Margaret,
you coming back to bed?'

19:02.184 --> 19:03.620
I'll be up in a minute.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.666
Keep your pants off.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.670
Does this little fleabag
have to be in bed

19:09.757 --> 19:11.106
with us the whole time?

19:11.193 --> 19:14.675
Oh, hey, boy.
I didn't hear you come in.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.938
You better get some shut-eye.
You got a big day tomorrow.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.200
And an even bigger night.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.289
Hey, save the dirty talk
for the bedroom.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.813
I'm just teasin' him.
Can't I tease my own boy?

19:22.900 --> 19:24.598
[Margaret]
'Don't think you
can waltz back in here'

19:24.685 --> 19:26.252
'and act like
the King of Siam.'

19:26.339 --> 19:29.037
'You're still as lippy
as ever, aren't you, Margaret?'

19:29.124 --> 19:31.170
You don't know the half of it.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.791
[theme music]
