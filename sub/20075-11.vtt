00:02.581 --> 00:06.302
How can you be sure that
that cop won't turn up?

00:06.362 --> 00:08.581
Because... (hushed) I killed him.

00:09.854 --> 00:13.655
Don't bullshit me. You and
Allie are up to sumpin'.

00:13.971 --> 00:18.354
You tell him Turk said, "Pay
up or he's a fucking dead man!"

00:18.360 --> 00:19.560
(Vera gasps)

00:19.566 --> 00:21.260
I will sort this out.

00:21.266 --> 00:23.160
I really care about you, Vera.

00:23.394 --> 00:25.693
Take ya fuckin' money. I'm out.

00:25.699 --> 00:28.170
You will be out when I say you're out.

00:28.176 --> 00:29.995
I'm gonna make you an offer.

00:30.152 --> 00:32.560
You can continue with your business.

00:32.566 --> 00:36.747
Stewart as Deputy Governor
and Ferguson as top dog?

00:36.753 --> 00:40.282
The women need you now more than ever!

00:40.288 --> 00:42.339
- She could tell them it wasn't you.
- (Iman whimpering) No.

00:42.345 --> 00:44.135
But she won't be telling them anything.

00:44.141 --> 00:45.758
(whooshing flourish with drum beats)

00:45.992 --> 00:50.124
ANSARI: I'm here to formally charge
you with the murder of Iman Farah.

00:50.130 --> 00:52.017
CHANNING: I'm gonna have to sideline you

00:52.023 --> 00:54.611
and I'm gonna assume the
role of Acting Governor.

00:54.617 --> 00:55.929
Everything is moving

00:55.935 --> 00:57.631
- according to plan.

Vera!

(sighs) Vera?!

02:20.988 --> 02:22.315
What?!

02:23.000 --> 02:24.314
Ho!

02:24.320 --> 02:26.588
- (Vera chuckles)
- You weren't in bed. (Chuckles)

02:26.594 --> 02:30.049
No, I've been up since four.
Work's rattling around in my brain.

02:30.055 --> 02:31.305
Do you want some coffee?

02:31.311 --> 02:33.107
(sighs) Yeah.

02:33.467 --> 02:34.776
Hey, um...

02:35.560 --> 02:37.136
I was thinking...

02:37.756 --> 02:40.592
we should go in together today.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.813
In the same car.

02:46.026 --> 02:49.026
(tense music with an ominous undertone)

- (locks clicking)
- (music ends)

03:03.679 --> 03:06.186
- It's about bloody time!
- I've been trying to see you all week.

03:06.192 --> 03:08.290
- Channing kept refusing, the arsehole.
- Well, how long have I fuckin'

03:08.296 --> 03:09.985
- been in here?
- Six days.

03:09.991 --> 03:11.909
And what about the
delivery? The workshop?

03:11.915 --> 03:13.219
God, don't worry about that.

03:13.225 --> 03:15.164
- When is it?
- It's the day after tomorrow,

03:15.170 --> 03:17.205
but that's the last thing
you need to worry about.

03:17.211 --> 03:19.704
No, I didn't kill Iman. It was Ferguson.

03:19.883 --> 03:21.086
(hushed) Fuck!

03:21.805 --> 03:23.130
That's what Allie said.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.512
- Can you get me out of here?
- Why did Ferguson do it?

03:25.518 --> 03:27.411
To screw me over, but
that's not the point.

03:27.417 --> 03:29.038
Of course it's the point!

03:29.044 --> 03:31.536
We need to stop this violence
and we need to stop her.

03:31.542 --> 03:33.227
- Kaz, you just need to get me
- (tense undertone)

03:33.233 --> 03:35.281
the fuck out of here. Now!

03:36.180 --> 03:38.578
KAZ: I've sat idle for too
long doing sweet fuck all,

03:38.584 --> 03:40.248
while she's terrorised the joint.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.979
And now she's committed murder.

03:42.985 --> 03:44.602
Another murder.

03:44.985 --> 03:46.299
Yes, Bubba.

03:46.952 --> 03:48.954
I haven't forgotten about Bea.

03:49.389 --> 03:52.061
And we can't let that stand.
We have a responsibility

03:52.067 --> 03:54.201
- to take that bitch down.
- (drum beats added to music)

03:55.040 --> 03:56.415
How?

03:56.967 --> 03:58.403
I got a plan.

03:58.409 --> 04:02.241
She's got Tina's crew, the
Boys, Kooris, smackheads

04:02.247 --> 04:04.263
and everyone else is shit-scared of her.

04:06.530 --> 04:08.810
- What if we weren't afraid?
- (ominous undertone)

Advertise your product or brand here

04:17.411 --> 04:18.732
I'm out.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.191
There is no out, Jake.

04:25.197 --> 04:27.042
There is only in,

04:27.417 --> 04:29.198
as in...

04:29.683 --> 04:31.302
up to your neck.

04:31.308 --> 04:33.722
Forget it. I'm cooked.

04:33.902 --> 04:35.795
Come on, that's impossible.

04:35.801 --> 04:37.596
We're simpatico.

04:37.602 --> 04:40.129
I don't give a fuck what we are.

04:40.934 --> 04:44.897
- I can't... y... I just... I... (sighs)
- What?

04:46.411 --> 04:49.111
Oh, God, don't tell me
you've fallen for her.

04:49.219 --> 04:52.118
- No, of course not.
- Oh, Jake. Jake.

04:52.124 --> 04:54.516
But no one deserves the shit
we're putting her through.

04:54.522 --> 04:56.032
How would you know what Vera deserves?

04:56.038 --> 04:58.221
I lost everything when she betrayed me.

04:58.227 --> 04:59.706
Everyone betrayed you.

04:59.712 --> 05:03.016
But not you. Because you know
you would be dead without me.

05:03.296 --> 05:04.891
Death would be better than this.

05:07.602 --> 05:10.013
You know if you're going to
kill yourself, make it count.

05:10.891 --> 05:14.016
Do it in Vera's bedroom, nice and messy.

05:18.012 --> 05:21.536
No, you lack the courage, don't you?

05:22.948 --> 05:24.468
Fuck you.

05:24.872 --> 05:26.657
You've won, Joan.

05:26.968 --> 05:30.202
Vera's no longer Governor.
What more do you fuckin' want?

05:30.208 --> 05:32.289
- Huh... eh... eh...!
- Just...

05:32.295 --> 05:35.165
after Channing has finished
his little charade of an audit,

05:35.171 --> 05:37.128
you will be Governor, hmm?

05:38.135 --> 05:40.412
Let's just finish what we started, huh?

05:41.314 --> 05:42.844
Break up with her.

05:44.416 --> 05:46.000
(hushed) Be cruel.

05:47.387 --> 05:49.214
(hushed) Make her suffer.

05:50.810 --> 05:53.810
(ominous music intensifies)

05:59.145 --> 06:02.343
- (drum beats flourish)
- (music ends)

06:02.349 --> 06:04.016
(indistinct yard chatter)

06:05.554 --> 06:08.469
VERA: No, I've got this. Just
make sure the dining room's clear.

06:08.475 --> 06:10.001
- (gate unlocking)
- Yes, Governor.

06:10.075 --> 06:12.379
- Why are you on patrol?
- Oh...

06:12.575 --> 06:14.468
Just trying to keep busy.

06:16.379 --> 06:17.778
What is it?

06:19.676 --> 06:21.253
(sighing) Vera.

06:22.406 --> 06:24.512
You and I, are just...

06:25.811 --> 06:27.015
What?

06:28.320 --> 06:29.766
Jake, what?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.081
Let's get the fuck out of here.

06:35.891 --> 06:37.393
We could travel.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.605
- (scoffs)
- Go to Europe,

06:39.611 --> 06:41.510
the States, wherever you want to go.

06:41.516 --> 06:43.492
What, you mean take some leave?

06:43.783 --> 06:45.474
I mean resign.

06:46.225 --> 06:47.491
- Huh...
- Ah...

06:47.497 --> 06:49.788
See, all the shit that's
happened in the last few weeks

06:49.794 --> 06:52.279
has made me realise
we'd be better off gone.

06:52.684 --> 06:54.109
Both of us.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.619
I'm talking about walking away...

06:56.887 --> 06:58.112
forever.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.424
- I love you, Vera.
- (magpie cawing)

07:06.825 --> 07:09.345
(both chuckle quietly)

07:12.246 --> 07:17.367
I j... I can't just up and leave
when things get tough, Jake.

07:17.473 --> 07:19.872
It's just... I don't... I
just don't work like that.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.480
(hushed) Yeah, okay.

07:26.098 --> 07:27.298
(hushed) Right.

07:35.938 --> 07:37.754
(phone ringing in background)

07:43.267 --> 07:44.467
(knocking)

07:44.473 --> 07:45.673
Come in.

07:47.434 --> 07:48.634
Governor.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.010
No, not any more, thanks
to you. (Sighs quietly)

07:52.518 --> 07:55.245
- Ah, Franky Doyle.
- What about her?

07:55.251 --> 07:57.216
Well, she's been in the slot for a week.

07:57.222 --> 07:58.731
Maybe it's time to let her out.

07:58.737 --> 08:01.517
Well, I no longer have the
authority to release Doyle,

08:01.523 --> 08:03.782
even if I was inclined
to, which I am not.

08:03.788 --> 08:05.616
So what, you don't believe her story?

08:05.622 --> 08:08.501
Well, what I think is irrelevant.
It's a matter for the police.

08:08.507 --> 08:10.600
- So, what, you gonna let her out?
- I've already told you, Will.

08:10.606 --> 08:12.304
It's not my decision.
It's up to Channing!

08:12.310 --> 08:14.054
Did I just hear my name taken in vain?

08:14.055 --> 08:15.255
(Vera sighs)

08:15.261 --> 08:16.961
Ah, Mr Jackson and I

08:16.967 --> 08:19.039
were just discussing Doyle's
length of stay in isolation.

08:19.045 --> 08:22.571
And I was explaining it
is your decision, not mine.

08:24.859 --> 08:26.080
Excuse me.

08:27.358 --> 08:29.764
And what's your opinion on Doyle?

08:29.840 --> 08:31.949
Well, given her accusations
against Ferguson,

08:31.955 --> 08:33.347
it's probably best to keep them apart.

08:33.352 --> 08:35.972
Who knows what Doyle
will do if she's released.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.484
Hmm.

08:38.110 --> 08:40.789
Well, it's a shame that
such astute judgements

08:40.794 --> 08:43.690
have been lacking in many
of your other decisions.

08:44.867 --> 08:47.775
- I'm just finalising my report now.
- Good.

08:47.781 --> 08:49.888
Sooner things get back
to normal, the better.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.079
Unfortunately, I'll be
recommending your permanent removal

08:54.085 --> 08:55.495
- from the governorship.
- (sombre music)

08:56.094 --> 08:57.873
I just thought I'd let you know,

08:58.172 --> 09:00.106
as a professional courtesy.

09:10.101 --> 09:11.998
- You requested to see Ferguson?
- (music ends)

09:12.218 --> 09:13.716
Thank you, Ms Miles.

09:14.278 --> 09:16.016
Take a seat, Joan.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.480
Now I know it's custom for
the staff to call prisoners

09:18.486 --> 09:22.264
by their surname, but to
me, you'll always be Joan.

09:22.273 --> 09:24.250
And you'll always be
a brothel-owning pimp

09:24.256 --> 09:27.249
masquerading as a
regional manager... Derek.

09:27.255 --> 09:29.164
(laughs)

09:29.170 --> 09:31.567
You must be a real hoot in the yard.

09:31.573 --> 09:33.664
I bet you're first
picked at basketball, too.

09:33.670 --> 09:34.877
Ha!

09:34.883 --> 09:36.571
Ah, enough of the small talk.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.587
Franky Doyle's lawyer
wants her out of isolation.

09:39.993 --> 09:43.479
Now, you know how insistent
these lawyers are when, uh,

09:43.485 --> 09:45.354
bangin' on about their
clients' human rights,

09:45.360 --> 09:49.687
so I've got no option but to, ah,
release Doyle back into General.

09:50.065 --> 09:53.776
I'm certain she'll be gunnin'
for you, given her accusation,

09:53.782 --> 09:58.097
so it's probably in your best
interests to go into Protection.

09:58.103 --> 09:59.306
Is that right?

09:59.312 --> 10:02.075
I'd hate to see anything
bad happen to you.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.714
(ominous music)

10:04.720 --> 10:07.117
You'd like to put me
into a box, wouldn't you,

10:07.123 --> 10:11.055
so things can run smoothly and
you'll come off as the prison saviour?

10:11.061 --> 10:12.426
I take it that's a no?

10:17.849 --> 10:19.343
You remember this, Joanie?

10:19.349 --> 10:22.356
This is your statement, absolving
the prison of responsibility

10:22.362 --> 10:23.763
if anything happens to you.

10:23.769 --> 10:29.737
Well, if it does, Joan,
it's not my fuckin' funeral.

10:30.348 --> 10:31.548
(music ends)

10:32.138 --> 10:35.138
(guards chatting indistinctly)

10:35.144 --> 10:38.596
Mr Stewart, can I have a word?!

10:40.002 --> 10:41.402
(door beeps unlocked)

10:51.219 --> 10:52.514
Let's do it.

10:53.715 --> 10:54.915
You're right.

10:55.498 --> 10:57.298
Stuff this place.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.836
Stuff Channing.

10:58.842 --> 11:01.729
A permanent holiday is just what I need.

11:01.735 --> 11:03.432
(laughs)

11:03.438 --> 11:05.813
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

11:05.819 --> 11:07.117
(Stewart laughs)

11:11.200 --> 11:12.806
I love you, too.

11:14.339 --> 11:17.339
- (chuckles quietly)
- (gentle music)

11:27.478 --> 11:29.283
So when are we gonna do this?

11:30.412 --> 11:31.612
Today?

11:31.618 --> 11:33.119
- (laughing) Now.
- (Stewart laughs)

11:33.125 --> 11:38.155
I am... I am gonna walk out of
here, go straight to Channing,

11:38.798 --> 11:40.597
tell him where to stick his job.

11:40.603 --> 11:42.329
(laughs) That's...

11:56.387 --> 11:59.387
- (music becomes ominous)
- (slowly whooshing flourish)

12:01.491 --> 12:03.663
Hello, Vera.

12:04.038 --> 12:05.429
I was gonna call you Governor,

12:05.435 --> 12:07.430
but you're not Governor
any more, are you?

12:07.522 --> 12:08.953
Oh, Joan.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.157
Don't you get tired of it all?

12:11.163 --> 12:13.544
Just the pointless baiting?

12:13.663 --> 12:15.281
Get a life.

12:16.835 --> 12:18.611
Still checking under the bed at night?

12:18.617 --> 12:21.756
(whooshing flourish)

12:24.800 --> 12:26.016
What did you say?

12:26.022 --> 12:30.237
Goodness me, there is such a
glow about you. What is that?

12:31.262 --> 12:33.577
Don't tell me, you're in love.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.272
Oh, that is so sweet.

12:35.809 --> 12:39.084
At least it would be, if it
weren't all based on a lie.

12:41.265 --> 12:43.335
Hate to be the one to break
it to you though, Vera,

12:43.341 --> 12:44.960
but you and, um,

12:45.419 --> 12:47.249
- your Jakey?
- (drum beats added to music)

12:47.760 --> 12:49.862
Nothing about it is real.

12:50.313 --> 12:51.741
It's fiction.

12:52.509 --> 12:54.834
Everything Jake has said,
everything he's done,

12:54.840 --> 12:57.240
it was all at my instruction.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.822
I don't believe you.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.860
Yes, you do.

13:03.652 --> 13:06.738
(hushed) Because deep down
you know a man like Jake

13:06.744 --> 13:08.434
could never love you.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.957
(hushed) He tells me everything.

13:13.761 --> 13:16.325
We laugh at how pathetic you are,

13:17.165 --> 13:18.974
especially in the bedroom.

13:20.978 --> 13:22.697
(hushed) And that little, um...

13:23.704 --> 13:26.356
that little peculiarity of yours,

13:28.718 --> 13:30.855
checking under the bed every night.

13:32.110 --> 13:35.117
Who would have thought all that time,

13:35.329 --> 13:38.947
the real monster was in bed beside you.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.845
(lift bell dings)

14:01.677 --> 14:03.077
- (button beeps)
- -

14:05.065 --> 14:09.417
(warping and fluttering flourish)

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
(sobs)

14:41.596 --> 14:42.796
(music ends)

14:43.205 --> 14:44.721
I'm not saying it's going to be easy.

14:44.727 --> 14:46.807
Of course there are risks involved,

14:46.813 --> 14:49.815
- but it's time to shut this shit down.
- Hey, Franky!

14:49.924 --> 14:51.434
KAZ: Here she is. Whoo!

14:51.440 --> 14:53.330
BOOMER: Eh, what happened?

14:53.336 --> 14:56.415
Kaz said Freaky Tits snapped Iman's
neck like a fuckin' chicken bone.

14:56.421 --> 14:57.979
- Yeah, that's right, Booms.
- BOOMER: Shit!

14:57.985 --> 14:59.292
What'd she do that for?

14:59.298 --> 15:01.294
Well, why does she do
anything? She's a psycho.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.409
Which is exactly why we have to
take her down once and for all.

15:04.782 --> 15:06.582
I asked Jackson to
get you out of the slot

15:06.588 --> 15:07.971
so you could be a part of this.

15:07.977 --> 15:10.250
- Part of what?
- KAZ: Kangaroo court.

15:10.256 --> 15:11.563
We're finally gonna hold Ferguson

15:11.569 --> 15:13.114
- to account for all the shit she's done
- (Franky scoffs)

15:13.120 --> 15:15.234
and give the women a chance
to speak without being afraid.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.222
Oh, right. All those women who
haven't had their tongue cut out?

15:18.228 --> 15:19.519
- We get enough women
- (Boomer laughing)

15:19.525 --> 15:21.834
standing by us, Franky, we can beat her.

15:22.728 --> 15:24.534
Why don't you kill her?

15:24.540 --> 15:26.545
- Do you have the guts to do that?
- BOOMER: Yeah.

15:26.703 --> 15:28.974
That'd make us no different to her.

15:28.980 --> 15:29.980
(scoffs quietly)

15:29.986 --> 15:32.485
So what, a public
pow-wow's your big idea?

15:32.491 --> 15:34.494
Shit, you do that, I
guarantee one thing,

15:34.500 --> 15:36.018
you're gonna be standing
there holding your dick.

15:36.024 --> 15:38.783
Franky, the women still
look up to you, love.

15:39.769 --> 15:41.472
You guys don't get it.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.829
You take her down and she will
rise up again. And you know why?

15:44.835 --> 15:47.047
'Cause she's willing to do
the things that you can't.

15:47.053 --> 15:48.720
This won't work without you.

15:59.816 --> 16:01.016
(sighs)

16:10.200 --> 16:11.914
Did you get pliers?

16:12.007 --> 16:13.586
(scoffs)

16:13.592 --> 16:15.594
"Hey, Allie, how you been?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.704
You will never believe
what happened to me."

16:17.710 --> 16:20.328
- Did you get pliers?
- Where from?

16:20.404 --> 16:22.701
What have you been doing all week?

16:22.873 --> 16:27.007
I got some clothes from Iman's
cell before they cleared it. Uh...

16:27.013 --> 16:28.560
Good, but we still need to get our way

16:28.566 --> 16:29.964
- out of the boxes.
- Hang on!

16:29.970 --> 16:32.669
(hushed) Hang on, Franky. What
the fuck happened with Iman?!

16:32.675 --> 16:35.320
- I told you, Ferguson killed her.
- Yeah, but why?

16:35.326 --> 16:38.251
And don't give me that "because
she's a psycho" bullshit.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.828
(sighs quietly)

16:40.509 --> 16:42.363
Iman killed Pennisi.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.636
(hushed) Oh! What?

16:46.306 --> 16:48.339
She was his lover. She
admitted everything,

16:48.345 --> 16:49.933
right before Ferguson necked her.

16:49.939 --> 16:51.535
Fuck off!

16:51.541 --> 16:54.726
Well, that's what I intend to
do, with you, day after tomorrow!

16:54.801 --> 16:56.001
(sighs)

16:56.007 --> 16:58.336
I was this close to
walking out of here, free.

16:58.342 --> 17:00.516
But that is why we should help Kaz

17:00.522 --> 17:02.756
put Ferguson on trial. Bring her down.

17:02.762 --> 17:04.553
And what do you think, Ferguson's
just going to stand there

17:04.559 --> 17:06.931
and admit she killed Iman? Come on.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.358
We're getting out in that delivery.

17:09.614 --> 17:11.320
That's what matters now.

17:21.452 --> 17:22.652
(knocking on door)

17:23.569 --> 17:24.861
You wanted to see me, Governor?

17:24.867 --> 17:26.211
Come in and shut the door.

17:29.655 --> 17:30.868
How'd it go?

17:31.072 --> 17:32.372
What'd Channing say?

17:32.378 --> 17:35.490
I bet he choked on his own
spit, begging you to stay.

17:35.959 --> 17:37.406
I know, Jake.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.763
Ferguson told me everything.

17:43.754 --> 17:45.217
She's a liar.

17:45.223 --> 17:48.465
No, she knows things only ever told you.

17:49.028 --> 17:51.652
- Vera, I can explain.
- Don't say another word.

17:52.762 --> 17:57.608
You have been getting close to
me and reporting back to her.

17:57.905 --> 17:59.918
You have been her pawn.

18:00.898 --> 18:03.075
Everything between us has been a lie.

18:03.081 --> 18:05.150
No. Not everything.

18:05.156 --> 18:06.866
Have you been dealing drugs
in this prison, Mr Stewart?

18:06.872 --> 18:09.974
- Vera, please listen to me.
- Are you going to deny any of it?

18:11.161 --> 18:12.443
Are you?!

18:16.139 --> 18:20.110
Please, Vera, what I did,
it w... w... it was...

18:20.116 --> 18:23.124
messed up. I know that. But...

18:25.053 --> 18:26.928
but I fell in love with you.

18:27.232 --> 18:30.047
I swear to you, that's the truth.

18:30.233 --> 18:32.880
Please, just give me another chance.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.856
If you don't resign,
I'll have you sacked.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.400
Vera...

18:40.850 --> 18:42.578
I love you.

18:45.509 --> 18:46.904
Get the fuck out.

18:48.984 --> 18:52.683
(inhales emotionally)

19:04.480 --> 19:06.076
- -
- (door beeps unlocked)

19:12.881 --> 19:15.365
Have you found Don...
D... Detective Kaplan?

19:15.371 --> 19:17.800
- He's still out of contact.
- Oh.

19:17.806 --> 19:20.266
I'm here to talk to
you about Sonia Stevens.

19:20.764 --> 19:24.160
Well, that's good, 'cause I
got a few things to tell ya.

19:24.233 --> 19:26.342
- I reckon she killed Detective...
- Liz...!

19:26.348 --> 19:28.745
I've got some questions
that need answering.

19:29.439 --> 19:31.559
Do you recognise this?

19:32.577 --> 19:34.796
Yeah, that's Sonia and her friend, Helen

19:34.802 --> 19:37.171
Not who. I mean what it is.

19:37.679 --> 19:38.979
It's a photo.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.460
It's "the" photo

19:40.466 --> 19:43.177
that was presented by Stevens'
defence for the first time

19:43.183 --> 19:44.958
- during your testimony.
- Yeah, that's right.

19:44.964 --> 19:46.905
And they said they got
it off Helen's phone.

19:46.911 --> 19:49.374
Which was found on the same
morning you took the stand.

19:49.380 --> 19:52.143
- Yeah.
- Very conveniently, as it happened.

19:52.241 --> 19:54.194
- Well, not for me. No.
- No.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.235
- It trapped you in a lie.
- Yeah.

19:56.241 --> 19:59.360
And it's because of your perjury
that the entire case against Stevens

19:59.366 --> 20:01.775
- was tainted and thrown out.
- Yeah.

20:02.478 --> 20:05.220
That's a pretty big
coincidence, don't you think?

20:05.533 --> 20:08.785
I've been going back over the case,
trying to make sense of it all.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.048
I put it to you

20:10.054 --> 20:13.702
that there was collusion to
deliberately subvert the trial.

20:14.278 --> 20:15.787
- Collusion?
- What did she promise

20:15.793 --> 20:17.272
in exchange for your perjury?

20:17.278 --> 20:19.130
Money, for when you
were eventually released?

20:19.136 --> 20:21.099
- Money now for your children?
- No, I'm... I'm sorry,

20:21.105 --> 20:23.421
- I don't... understand. What, you...?
- You befriended Sonia.

20:23.427 --> 20:24.710
- You shared a cell block together,
- Yeah.

20:24.716 --> 20:26.422
- Became friends.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's because

20:26.428 --> 20:28.397
D-Don asked me to. You
gotta talk to the Governor,

20:28.403 --> 20:29.997
- 'cause she knows. All this t...
- You cooked up this plan

20:30.003 --> 20:32.934
together to undermine
the Prosecution's case.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.239
(hushed) Oh, shit.

20:34.245 --> 20:38.171
You... y... y... you think I c...
I colluded with Sonia Stevens?!

20:38.380 --> 20:39.632
I'm afraid it's the only

20:39.638 --> 20:41.380
- reasonable explanation.
- No, no, no, no!

20:41.386 --> 20:43.271
- No, I didn't!
- Oh, you'll be facing

20:43.277 --> 20:44.960
worse charges than perjury.

20:44.966 --> 20:49.887
- Perverting the course of justice.
- I didn't collude with Sonia Stevens!

20:51.179 --> 20:53.913
It's obvious someone colluded here, Liz.

20:54.101 --> 20:56.304
If it wasn't you and Sonia,

20:56.507 --> 20:57.904
who was it?

21:01.224 --> 21:02.519
(water running)

21:02.525 --> 21:03.925
(gate beeps unlocked)

21:06.216 --> 21:09.646
BOOMER: Hey? Hey, how'd
you go at your committal?

21:09.888 --> 21:11.311
Are we still on schedule?

21:11.317 --> 21:15.071
Yeah. Yeah, soon as you're
out I'm ready to take over, eh.

21:15.077 --> 21:17.784
- Well, that won't be happening.
- What? Why?

21:17.790 --> 21:21.393
Because my brilliant lawyers
made me cop a plea, that's why.

21:21.399 --> 21:24.892
Liz! Are you watering those
seedlings or torturing them?

21:25.586 --> 21:27.894
Right. Holy shit, eh?

21:27.900 --> 21:29.292
- Yes, indeed.
- Yeah.

21:29.298 --> 21:31.377
It was made very clear
to me that my only option

21:31.383 --> 21:34.353
was to plead guilty to the
lesser charge of manslaughter.

21:34.359 --> 21:35.625
Oh, right.

21:35.631 --> 21:38.056
So you might be here
for a while then, hey?

21:38.062 --> 21:40.039
Thanks to the cop who set me up,

21:40.468 --> 21:41.857
it would seem so.

21:41.863 --> 21:43.143
How?

21:44.244 --> 21:46.047
Did you say something, Liz?

21:46.560 --> 21:49.014
How did the cop set you up?

21:49.020 --> 21:52.020
(tense undertone)

21:52.822 --> 21:54.022
(folder clatters)

21:54.416 --> 21:57.416
(music becomes intriguing)

22:07.412 --> 22:09.303
IMAN: <i>He was obsessed with you!</i>

22:09.896 --> 22:11.241
- (whooshing flourish)
- He even had a shrine

22:11.247 --> 22:12.995
- to you all over the wall! (Echoing)
- (music ends)

22:13.680 --> 22:15.934
- I can't see anything.
- Exactly.

22:15.940 --> 22:18.350
All the other walls, look,
check it out. Look at it.

22:18.356 --> 22:19.631
- Mm.
- They've all got shit on them,

22:19.637 --> 22:22.146
except this one. It's empty.

22:22.152 --> 22:25.120
Too empty, like something's
been removed from it.

22:25.432 --> 22:27.238
Pennisi's shrine.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.534
An absence of something isn't proof.

22:30.540 --> 22:32.846
Iman topped Pennisi because
he was obsessed with me,

22:32.852 --> 22:34.815
so it makes sense that
she'd want to remove

22:34.821 --> 22:37.192
- any trace of that obsession.
- Well, this is all hypothetical.

22:37.198 --> 22:39.494
Not if she kept the photos.
That's concrete evidence

22:39.500 --> 22:41.210
- that she was there.
- Franky, we've been through this

22:41.216 --> 22:44.327
the police do not want to investigate
anyone else over Pennisi's murder.

22:44.333 --> 22:46.343
Look, if they just searched her place...

22:46.349 --> 22:48.724
- Franky!
- She fuckin' took that shrine, Imogen,

22:48.730 --> 22:50.342
- and then she came in here to kill me.
- Franky.

22:50.348 --> 22:51.645
Franky, stop for a moment!

22:51.651 --> 22:55.630
If I tell the police your
theory, without any proof...

22:56.276 --> 22:59.698
- in their eyes, that gives you motive.
- Get the proof!

22:59.704 --> 23:02.193
There is no proof.

23:03.175 --> 23:05.273
Just an empty wall.

23:07.276 --> 23:08.776
So I'm fucked?

23:10.859 --> 23:12.865
- (whooshing flourish)
- (grunts)

23:12.871 --> 23:18.640
- (echoing punches)
- (grunts and screams with effort)

23:22.343 --> 23:23.901
(breathes heavily and grunts)

23:23.906 --> 23:27.228
Kaz is convinced that she can take
down Ferguson with your help.

23:27.234 --> 23:30.004
(grunts and breathes heavily)

23:30.324 --> 23:32.728
(scoffs) I can't believe
you'd just do nothing.

23:32.734 --> 23:34.747
(hushed) I'm not doin' nothin'.

23:34.753 --> 23:36.126
I'm getting out of here.

23:36.132 --> 23:38.771
But you're letting her get away
with what she's done to you.

23:38.777 --> 23:40.328
Fuck the Freak!

23:40.433 --> 23:42.550
I'm not that person any more.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.040
Why do you wanna help
so bad anyway, huh?

23:47.193 --> 23:49.427
Shit, Allie, I told ya.

23:49.433 --> 23:52.146
The best revenge for Red is
to get the fuck out of here

23:52.152 --> 23:55.576
- and leave Ferguson to rot.
- Yeah, only she won't rot, will she?

23:55.864 --> 23:59.492
She'll still be here. She'll still
be Top Dog, torturing the women.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.169
Killing them.

24:01.864 --> 24:03.561
Well, fuckin' don't come with me, then.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.389
- No, Franky!
- No, fuck you.

24:05.395 --> 24:06.873
It's okay, I'll go alone.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.692
- I don't need ya. I don't need ya!
- Franky!

24:08.698 --> 24:09.898
Fuck off.

24:12.449 --> 24:13.649
(hushed) Fuck!

24:14.183 --> 24:16.783
(indistinct inmate chatter in distance)

24:20.058 --> 24:21.258
(door opens)

24:33.310 --> 24:37.648
That photo that came from
Helen's phone was the one thing

24:37.654 --> 24:39.922
that trapped me in a lie.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.227
And the police are right.

24:45.738 --> 24:47.337
There was collusion.

24:49.150 --> 24:51.282
It was between you and Don.

24:51.361 --> 24:54.074
He sucked me in to giving evidence,

24:54.080 --> 24:57.369
then he made sure Helen's
phone was found that morning,

24:57.375 --> 25:00.342
to make me look like a liar.

25:00.588 --> 25:02.428
Are you telling me

25:02.912 --> 25:05.199
- that you were Witness X?
- (slowly intensifying ominous music)

25:23.340 --> 25:25.992
(breathing unsteadily)

25:26.300 --> 25:27.500
(music ends)

25:30.395 --> 25:32.449
(indistinct radio chatter)

25:38.851 --> 25:40.051
Will?

25:44.219 --> 25:45.852
Will, I'm sorry.

25:45.858 --> 25:47.587
(Vera sighs)

25:50.800 --> 25:52.379
You were right.

25:53.303 --> 25:54.977
About Jake.

25:56.592 --> 25:58.694
He, um, (chuckles emotionally)

25:58.818 --> 26:01.756
he was deceiving all
of us, except for you.

26:01.960 --> 26:06.350
You were the only one who
did see through his lies.

26:07.870 --> 26:10.779
- I'm sorry. (Sighs deeply)
- (dramatic music intensifying)

26:11.347 --> 26:13.769
- I'm demanding his resignation.
- WOMAN: (over PA) <i>Attention, compound.</i>

26:13.840 --> 26:16.769
<i>All women to report to
assigned work duties.</i>

26:27.352 --> 26:28.552
(music darkens)

26:28.558 --> 26:31.159
- All right, everyone out now.
- (Classical aria playing on radio)

26:31.165 --> 26:33.067
Work unit's ending early.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.310
Go on, get out, now!

26:42.744 --> 26:43.944
(all music ends)

26:44.120 --> 26:45.543
Not you.

26:55.841 --> 26:57.041
(door closes)

26:59.720 --> 27:03.567
I swear to you, I will
do whatever it takes

27:03.573 --> 27:06.688
- to fucking destroy you.
- Now, now, Jake.

27:07.715 --> 27:12.334
Just stop deluding yourself that
you have any kind of free will.

27:13.410 --> 27:15.210
You don't control me.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.520
Remember Jesper?

27:19.192 --> 27:21.158
That's your word against mine.

27:21.978 --> 27:23.884
I'll take that fuckin' risk.

27:24.478 --> 27:26.388
- What about the drug money?
- (tense undertone)

27:27.071 --> 27:29.403
The payments you made through my lawyer?

27:29.800 --> 27:32.664
Do you really think that I wouldn't
have made absolutely certain

27:32.670 --> 27:35.480
that the money trail
leads directly to you?

27:38.438 --> 27:40.946
Hard to charm your way out of that one.

27:44.191 --> 27:46.230
Take it from one who knows.

27:46.369 --> 27:48.609
Life on your side of the bars,

27:49.593 --> 27:50.970
(hushed) preferable.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.753
Especially for someone so
mentally ill-equipped to handle

27:56.051 --> 27:58.186
life's hardships.

28:00.364 --> 28:03.364
(music intensifies with dramatic drums)

28:07.619 --> 28:08.819
(music ends)

28:14.210 --> 28:16.575
I know what you've done, Joan.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.785
Justice is coming.

28:21.128 --> 28:22.745
I'll put the kettle on.

28:25.711 --> 28:27.835
(Liz sobs)

28:29.200 --> 28:30.520
Liz?

28:31.290 --> 28:33.993
- Liz, what's wrong?
- It's... I'm all right.

28:33.999 --> 28:35.980
- (sniffles)
- No, don't. Oh, s...

28:37.000 --> 28:39.126
What... what... what
are you blubbin' for?

28:39.376 --> 28:41.303
- Oh, fuck!
- Hey?

28:41.898 --> 28:44.347
(sighing) I don't know, Booms. (Sobs)

28:45.211 --> 28:49.914
(breathing quivering) I feel...
a... anxious all the time.

28:50.004 --> 28:51.313
I feel...

28:51.739 --> 28:52.939
(sighs)

28:52.945 --> 28:54.695
like I'm not safe.

28:54.701 --> 28:56.805
- No, you're safe.
- Am I?

28:56.811 --> 28:58.666
Yeah, you're safe!

28:58.877 --> 29:02.175
- I'm here.
- Oh. Oh, lovey.

29:02.979 --> 29:04.922
I'm always gonna look after ya.

29:04.928 --> 29:07.766
- (sobbing quietly) Yeah?
- Okay? Always.

29:08.430 --> 29:10.346
(chuckles nervously) Oh.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.923
- Mmm, looks like it's healing well.
- Must be your magic touch.

29:15.929 --> 29:17.502
Bet you say that to all the girls.

29:17.593 --> 29:19.327
FRANKY: Only the cute ones.

29:21.101 --> 29:24.289
- Or those in uniform.
- (quietly, incredulously) Oh, my God.

29:28.199 --> 29:29.399
(Radcliffe chuckles quietly)

29:30.311 --> 29:32.012
Am I making you nervous?

29:32.286 --> 29:33.486
(Radcliffe chuckles quietly)

29:37.080 --> 29:39.091
Oh, well, now you're just teasin' me.

29:39.097 --> 29:41.458
Oh, I like men.

29:41.464 --> 29:43.255
I like a challenge.

29:43.661 --> 29:46.146
Wouldn't be the first time
I turned a straight chick.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.881
Anything else? (Chuckles)

29:47.887 --> 29:49.508
Headaches and blurry vision.

29:49.514 --> 29:51.926
- How long have you had that?
- All week.

29:51.932 --> 29:53.615
And you didn't think to tell anyone?

29:53.621 --> 29:56.839
- I was in the slot, babes. Kinda hard.
- Nah, it could be concussion related.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.111
I'll get the doctor. Sit tight.

29:59.117 --> 30:00.356
Not going anywhere.

30:00.362 --> 30:03.362
(urgent percussive music intensifying)

30:30.714 --> 30:31.914
(music quells)

30:31.920 --> 30:33.120
(sighs)

30:34.878 --> 30:36.145
(music intensifies)

30:43.280 --> 30:46.430
She's complaining of a
headache and blurred vision.

30:48.996 --> 30:50.196
(music ends)

30:51.901 --> 30:54.686
- Hey-ya.
- This is Francesca.

31:20.680 --> 31:23.160
Not pliers, but it'll get staples out.

31:25.737 --> 31:27.568
(sighs quietly)

31:29.506 --> 31:30.905
- (exhales sharply)
- (gentle music intensifying)

31:30.911 --> 31:32.237
For you.

31:40.959 --> 31:42.159
(chuckles)

31:42.388 --> 31:45.299
But let's do something good
for the women before we go.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.125
Liz, Booms.

31:50.003 --> 31:51.509
They're your family.

31:52.777 --> 31:54.677
You and Kaz.

31:54.763 --> 31:56.881
I really think you can do it.

32:00.373 --> 32:01.952
- (sighs)
- (music ends)

32:01.958 --> 32:04.060
- You're not helping, Susan.
- Oh...

32:04.061 --> 32:07.092
- Susan, are you all right?
- Hey?

32:07.585 --> 32:09.585
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm...

32:09.890 --> 32:11.984
I'm just... I'm worried about Liz.

32:11.990 --> 32:13.220
Well, why?

32:13.221 --> 32:14.928
Oh, I don't know.

32:15.022 --> 32:17.818
She's like anxious as shit, eh?

32:18.498 --> 32:20.514
Well, that will be guilt.

32:20.803 --> 32:22.003
Huh?

32:22.120 --> 32:23.606
She didn't tell you?

32:24.920 --> 32:28.361
That old soak was Witness X.

32:28.367 --> 32:29.964
(ominous undertone intensifying)

32:30.041 --> 32:31.241
What?

32:41.170 --> 32:42.370
(music ends with an echoing drum beat)

32:42.986 --> 32:44.653
(hair flicking violently)

32:58.414 --> 33:00.948
You haven't learnt your lesson, have ya?

33:02.608 --> 33:04.300
What? Booms, what?

33:04.306 --> 33:05.748
Are you Witness X?

33:06.413 --> 33:07.613
(breathes shakily)

33:08.360 --> 33:09.615
Are ya?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.571
(emotionally) Fuck!

33:16.080 --> 33:17.970
- (hushed) Fuck!
- (sniffles)

33:18.367 --> 33:20.280
So you lagged on Sonia?!

33:20.852 --> 33:22.668
How could you do that?!

33:22.774 --> 33:25.479
- Boomer, I need to explain to you...
- No, don't, don't even, don't!

33:25.485 --> 33:28.110
- Please, let me...!
- Don't! You are a, like,

33:28.116 --> 33:29.486
a serial lagger!

33:29.492 --> 33:31.102
- No, no, no...
- You can't fuckin' help yourself,

33:31.108 --> 33:33.377
- can ya? No, Sonia...
- No, don't say that.

33:33.383 --> 33:35.820
Sonia's done great stuff for us, right?

33:35.826 --> 33:37.914
- And you, you just lag on her!
- (gentle music)

33:37.920 --> 33:41.444
- No! No, no, no, no! I just...
- Ya lag! And ya lag!

33:41.450 --> 33:44.360
And ya lag! And ya lag!

33:44.366 --> 33:47.046
- You're just a fuckin' piece of shit!
- (Liz sobbing)

33:47.052 --> 33:50.205
- Shit!
- No, I know!

33:50.283 --> 33:52.705
I fucked up!

33:52.783 --> 33:54.978
I fuckin' know! I fucked it up.

33:54.984 --> 33:56.566
(sobs) I fucked it... fucked...

33:56.572 --> 33:58.705
I know! I'm a fuck up!

33:58.711 --> 34:02.058
Okay? I fucked up! (Sobs)

34:02.124 --> 34:03.449
I fucked it all.

34:03.455 --> 34:05.782
(sobs)

34:05.841 --> 34:10.092
I fuck everything up! I'm a fuck-up!

34:10.098 --> 34:11.356
I fucked it up!

34:11.362 --> 34:14.855
I'm a fuck-up! I'm a fuck-up!

34:16.342 --> 34:19.342
- (sobs and mumbles incoherently)
- (sniffs)

34:26.172 --> 34:29.159
FEMALE NURSE: I've just given you
a sedative. You'll sleep well now.

34:29.259 --> 34:30.648
(trolley wheels creaking)

34:35.643 --> 34:37.112
(tray and cutlery clatter)

34:38.559 --> 34:40.831
- (wheels creaking)
- (music becoming darker)

34:42.847 --> 34:44.607
- Oh, hey, Donna,
- Yeah?

34:44.612 --> 34:46.918
I just need you for a tick.
It doesn't matter what I do,

34:46.924 --> 34:49.445
I'm still getting a hard time
from the women in the midline.

34:49.451 --> 34:52.036
- Yeah? Which prisoners?
- Radic...

34:52.042 --> 34:54.509
(Staff continue talking indistinctly)

34:56.511 --> 34:58.378
(door creaks closed)

35:01.721 --> 35:02.924
(clicks mouth)

35:02.930 --> 35:05.823
Oh, Liz.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.659
You were right.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.116
About everything, really.

35:11.122 --> 35:14.816
(voice distorting and echoing)
You were the perfect patsy.

35:15.229 --> 35:18.136
So sad and needy.

35:18.142 --> 35:20.375
- Such a...
- (Liz moans)

35:21.017 --> 35:23.101
desperado.

35:23.874 --> 35:26.704
Don't you worry about
this Witness X nonsense.

35:26.710 --> 35:29.429
I've told Susan, mum's the word, hmm?

35:30.679 --> 35:35.157
I don't want anyone exacting
retribution on you for your betrayal.

35:35.350 --> 35:36.550
(Liz moans)

35:37.327 --> 35:39.761
I want to deal with you myself.

35:40.429 --> 35:44.526
In my own unique way.

35:45.872 --> 35:47.072
(Liz moans)

35:57.636 --> 36:00.550
- (Liz moans)

FERGUSON: <i>There is no out, Jake.</i>

36:19.126 --> 36:21.919
VERA: <i>I know, Jake.
Ferguson told me everything.</i>

36:21.925 --> 36:24.216
FERGUSON: <i>We're simpatico.
What about the drug money?</i>

36:24.222 --> 36:27.236
<i>There is no out, Jake. The payments
you made through my lawyer.</i>

36:27.242 --> 36:28.706
<i>There is no out. There is no out.</i>

36:28.712 --> 36:31.332
<i>Stop deluding yourself that
you have any kind of freedom.</i>

36:31.338 --> 36:33.795

37:27.639 --> 37:28.839
(clattering)

37:34.756 --> 37:35.956

(sighs)

39:01.919 --> 39:03.630
(knocking)

39:12.720 --> 39:15.306
It's better if you don't go back at all.

39:15.384 --> 39:17.596
I'll tell Channing you've
had a death in the family.

39:17.602 --> 39:19.080
You had to go interstate.

39:19.081 --> 39:21.610
Made you reprioritise.
You won't be returning.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.042
I'm not resigning, Vera.

39:32.224 --> 39:33.424
Can't.

39:33.611 --> 39:37.587
Then I'll go to the board, and
then I'll involve the police.

39:38.768 --> 39:40.275
(sighs)

39:42.973 --> 39:45.182
I know you scapegoated Murphy.

39:45.260 --> 39:48.191
I know you were responsible
for letting Bea Smith out

39:48.197 --> 39:50.020
to try and murder Ferguson.

39:50.597 --> 39:53.011
If you try and make a move on me,

39:55.090 --> 39:57.154
I'll be forced to move on you.

40:06.148 --> 40:07.774
I'm sorry, Vera.

40:09.238 --> 40:13.478
(footfall receding)

40:13.484 --> 40:17.965
- (whooshing flourish)
- (echoing banging and clanging)

40:17.971 --> 40:20.610
(birds twittering)

40:20.616 --> 40:22.392
- (zinging flourish)
- (echoing drum beat)

40:22.832 --> 40:25.832
(pulsating music)

40:28.815 --> 40:30.922
- (sniffs deeply)
- (warping flourish)

40:35.549 --> 40:36.749
(music ends)

40:37.775 --> 40:39.986
(hums to herself)

40:44.001 --> 40:45.201
(inmate makes bird call in background)

40:45.993 --> 40:47.602
- (gasps)
- (clattering)

40:47.608 --> 40:48.808
Oh.

40:51.194 --> 40:52.723
What do you want?

40:54.774 --> 40:56.777
It's your day in court, Freak.

40:59.761 --> 41:02.761
- -
- (tense music intensifying)

41:10.130 --> 41:11.756
- Oh, what the fuck?!
- Don't fuckin'...

41:11.762 --> 41:13.538
- All you officers, out of the yard!
- Oi, Latham...

41:13.544 --> 41:15.544
- Now! Do it!
- Let her go, now!

41:15.732 --> 41:19.258
- Out of the yard or we shiv Miles.
- Yeah, back up.

41:19.458 --> 41:20.745
Now!

41:21.753 --> 41:23.138
All right, let's go.

41:23.144 --> 41:24.470
- Boyd!
- Piss off.

41:24.476 --> 41:25.794
- Fuck off!
- Yeah, fuck off!

41:26.433 --> 41:27.786
This is Sierra 5.

41:27.792 --> 41:29.777
We've got a Code Brown
in the exercise yard.

41:29.783 --> 41:31.431
This is Sierra 2. What's going on?

41:31.437 --> 41:33.662
Proctor's taken control of H Block yard.

41:33.668 --> 41:35.763
Yeah, prisoners have got
a shiv on Linda Miles.

41:35.769 --> 41:37.072
Attention, all staff.

41:37.078 --> 41:39.985
We have a hostage situation
in the H Block yard.

41:39.991 --> 41:42.686
Order a lockdown. I
repeat, order a lockdown.

41:42.692 --> 41:44.397
- (siren wails)
- MAN: (over PA) <i>Attention, compound.</i>

41:44.403 --> 41:47.890
<i>Attention, compound.
This is a Code Brown.</i>

41:47.896 --> 41:50.840
<i>All prisoners return to
their units immediately.</i>

41:50.846 --> 41:53.536
<i>I repeat, this is a code Brown.</i>

41:53.542 --> 41:56.749
<i>All prisoners return to
their units immediately.</i>

41:56.755 --> 41:58.404
- (siren wails)
- -

41:58.410 --> 42:00.111
(doors slamming and locking)

42:00.117 --> 42:01.715
(door clanging shut)

42:01.721 --> 42:04.067
- -
- (door beeps unlocked)

42:06.384 --> 42:07.914
(drum beats punctuate the music)

42:08.000 --> 42:10.156
What the fuck is going on, huh?

42:10.162 --> 42:11.852
Calm the fuck down.

42:11.858 --> 42:15.200
(women shout and argue)

42:15.277 --> 42:16.988
Listen!

42:16.994 --> 42:18.395
- (siren continues to wail)
- (music quells)

42:18.400 --> 42:22.405
This is about giving all of us the right

42:22.411 --> 42:24.531
- to be heard.
- (women shout and question)

42:24.537 --> 42:30.753
The opportunity to speak without
fear, without being afraid

42:31.037 --> 42:34.221
of a top dog who seeks to control us

42:34.227 --> 42:37.535
- by terrorising us into submission.
- INMATE: Oh, Jesus!

42:37.541 --> 42:39.822
Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck!

42:39.828 --> 42:42.024
No! No!

42:43.250 --> 42:46.237
- We need to clear that yard.
- Well, that's easier said than done.

42:46.243 --> 42:48.372
They've got Linda and
they're threatening Ferguson.

42:48.469 --> 42:51.079
It's time to decide whether
we want a woman like this

42:51.085 --> 42:52.377
having control over us.

42:52.383 --> 42:55.176
- She is Top Dog.
- She is, yeah!

42:55.182 --> 43:00.178
The only way to take her down
is to challenge her, one on one.

43:00.184 --> 43:01.754
Are you gonna do that, Kaz?

43:02.808 --> 43:05.925
KAZ: That is not the only way.

43:05.931 --> 43:09.487
<i>She declared herself Top Dog in a coup.</i>

43:09.493 --> 43:12.003
<i>We can all vote.</i>

43:12.009 --> 43:14.522
- They're having an election?
- Call in the CSDS.

43:14.528 --> 43:15.821
No, they're just talking.

43:15.827 --> 43:17.827
They have an officer hostage.

43:17.833 --> 43:20.655
- We don't have to take this shit...
- We have to disperse them.

43:20.661 --> 43:22.725
Let's just see how it plays out.

43:22.731 --> 43:25.898
It is not going to play
out well for Ferguson!

43:26.028 --> 43:27.560
KAZ: <i>Pathetic!</i>

43:28.137 --> 43:30.551
(women protesting)

43:30.557 --> 43:31.757
Vera!

43:32.036 --> 43:33.935
Don't you interfere!

43:33.941 --> 43:35.261
Right!

43:36.160 --> 43:40.292
Before we get to decide
that, we need to know exactly

43:40.298 --> 43:42.200
who this woman is and what she's done.

43:42.206 --> 43:43.706
Franky, tell 'em.

43:43.801 --> 43:46.699
- Tell 'em everything.
- Good on ya, Frank! Go on!

43:49.792 --> 43:52.400
She killed Iman Farah!

43:52.406 --> 43:53.774
MERCADO: Bullshit!

43:54.500 --> 43:58.087
Iman's beef was with me, not her.

43:58.274 --> 44:02.080
You murdered Iman for no
other reason than to get to me.

44:02.462 --> 44:04.953
And you murdered Bea Smith.

44:05.940 --> 44:09.072
HUTCH: No, it was self-defence,
Franky! Self-defence!

44:09.078 --> 44:12.893
Eight stab wounds? That's
not fuckin' self-defence.

44:14.080 --> 44:17.001
You also killed Simone Slater.

44:17.181 --> 44:19.581
- Oh, fuck off!
- She was an inmate here.

44:19.587 --> 44:21.501
Some of you remember her, right?

44:22.600 --> 44:24.798
You gave her a hotshot, didn't you?

44:24.804 --> 44:26.103
- (gasps and murmurs)
- Oh, fuck off!

44:26.108 --> 44:28.221
And you hotshotted Allie, too.

44:28.227 --> 44:29.514
Allie? What?

44:29.520 --> 44:31.918
You tortured Jodie Spiteri.

44:31.924 --> 44:33.300
- Remember Jodie?
- (drum beats flourish)

44:33.494 --> 44:35.106
Why don't you tell them

44:35.112 --> 44:37.776
how you made her shove a
fucking pencil in her eye?

44:37.782 --> 44:39.354
- (gasps and murmurs)
- She's gotta be crazy!

44:39.542 --> 44:41.971
And you cut Lucy Gambaro's

44:41.977 --> 44:43.307
- tongue out.
- Get out of the way.

44:43.313 --> 44:45.395
- Get out of the way!
- And I reckon that you killed

44:45.401 --> 44:48.041
Jess Warner right before you started

44:48.047 --> 44:52.018
that fire in H Block that
nearly killed all of us!

44:52.024 --> 44:54.384
(women shout and argue)

44:58.585 --> 45:00.796
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.330
She's just one woman!

45:03.336 --> 45:04.720
Look at her!

45:04.726 --> 45:07.608
The bitch bleeds just
like the rest of us.

45:07.614 --> 45:09.079
Oooh!

45:09.320 --> 45:13.690
If we stand together, we can beat her.

45:14.095 --> 45:16.200
No! No!

45:16.206 --> 45:19.986
Mr Channing, you need to order
the officers into the yard now!

45:20.360 --> 45:23.183
No officer is to enter the yard.

45:23.189 --> 45:24.667
That is an order.

45:24.673 --> 45:27.565
We each take a vote. We each get a say.

45:27.571 --> 45:29.805
That's how this works. This...

45:30.774 --> 45:32.565
this is about justice.

45:32.571 --> 45:36.120
(women shout and jeer)

45:38.863 --> 45:40.068
FERGUSON: Hey.

45:40.074 --> 45:41.533
Hey!

45:43.915 --> 45:45.297
What about me?

45:45.984 --> 45:49.307
Do I get a say in this little
kangaroo court of yours?

45:49.313 --> 45:50.784
Absolutely, Joan.

45:50.790 --> 45:52.493
You're point of view is just as valid

45:52.499 --> 45:55.092
and we would love to hear your defence.

45:55.098 --> 45:57.722
- She's right. She's right.
- Fuckin' kill that bitch!

45:57.728 --> 45:59.097
- (magpie caws)
- (music ends)

45:59.800 --> 46:02.210
I am not going to dignify that

46:02.303 --> 46:04.971
farrago of allegations with a denial.

46:04.977 --> 46:06.742
- She's fucking mental!
- Get rid of her!

46:06.748 --> 46:08.259
Believe 'em if you want.

46:08.817 --> 46:10.474
But know this.

46:11.505 --> 46:13.545
Everything I do,

46:14.151 --> 46:18.245
any measures I have taken, I've
done for the benefit of you women.

46:18.674 --> 46:21.133
Society has turned its back on you.

46:21.280 --> 46:24.577
It's deemed your behaviour,
your actions, unacceptable,

46:24.583 --> 46:26.431
so you've been herded into cages,

46:26.437 --> 46:27.688
- locked up.
- Yeah.

46:28.078 --> 46:29.447
- Alone,
- (magpie caws)

46:30.307 --> 46:31.763
outcast,

46:32.524 --> 46:33.852
unloved,

46:34.819 --> 46:36.317
unforgiven.

46:37.142 --> 46:38.636
Unforgivable.

46:38.642 --> 46:40.160
- She's right!
- Right.

46:42.431 --> 46:45.862
Simply because you lack the
basic discipline and intelligence

46:45.868 --> 46:47.564
- to conduct your lives responsibly.
- (ominous undertone)

46:47.570 --> 46:49.931
- What?! Fuckin' bitch!
- What'd she say?

46:49.937 --> 46:51.332
Fuck off!

46:51.524 --> 46:53.494
You have the self-control of children.

46:53.500 --> 46:55.105
(grumbling)

46:55.111 --> 46:57.614
You are emotional. Defective.

46:57.699 --> 46:58.997
I...

46:59.003 --> 47:01.474
- I give you order!
- Bullshit! She's insane!

47:01.480 --> 47:03.519
I give you structure.

47:03.597 --> 47:05.605
I give you strength!

47:05.611 --> 47:07.022
You're fucking full of shit!

47:07.028 --> 47:10.337
I'm the only person who
does what needs to be done!

47:11.208 --> 47:13.523
Because I'm the only one who can!

47:14.325 --> 47:16.444
You lack the mental capacity!

47:16.450 --> 47:18.829
You're incapable of
thinking for yourselves!

47:19.005 --> 47:21.739
- You need me!
- INMATE: Vote!

47:21.745 --> 47:23.458
Without me you're nothing more than...

47:23.464 --> 47:26.346
- pigs! Filthy, filthy...
- Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!

47:26.352 --> 47:28.283
- Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!
- pigs,

47:28.289 --> 47:31.200
- Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!
- with your snouts in the trough!

47:31.206 --> 47:34.156
Vote! Vote! Vote!
Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!

47:34.162 --> 47:36.646
<i>- Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!</i>
- FERGUSON: <i>You need me!</i>

47:36.652 --> 47:39.656
- Vote! Vote! Vote!
- All right! Let's vote.

47:39.662 --> 47:42.234
Who wants Ferguson for Top Dog?

47:42.240 --> 47:45.165
(booing and jeering)

47:45.171 --> 47:48.041
ALL: Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

47:48.047 --> 47:50.314
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

47:50.320 --> 47:53.628
- Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
- Guilty! Guilty!

47:53.634 --> 47:56.114
- BOOMER: Guilty!
- (hushed) Anyone who betrays me will pay.

47:56.120 --> 47:59.111
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

47:59.117 --> 48:02.599
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

48:02.605 --> 48:04.438
- I'd say that's...
- Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

48:04.444 --> 48:06.320
- Unanimous, Joanie.
- (whooshing flourish)

48:06.326 --> 48:10.360
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

48:10.366 --> 48:12.806
All right, ladies, meeting's over!

48:12.812 --> 48:14.886
Well done! Back to your units!

48:14.892 --> 48:16.488
(cheering)

48:16.494 --> 48:19.582
(whooshing flourish)

(echoing thud)

48:21.503 --> 48:24.503
(dark pulsating music)

48:26.068 --> 48:28.148
- Yeah!
- No!

48:28.154 --> 48:29.732
- Get out!
- String her up!

48:29.738 --> 48:31.336
(shouting and jeering)

48:31.342 --> 48:33.556
KAZ: No!

48:33.631 --> 48:35.839
Argh! Argh!

48:37.777 --> 48:39.113
Ah, no!

48:40.590 --> 48:44.000
Mr Channing, are you seeing
this? Send the officers in now!

48:44.006 --> 48:45.246
Negative.

48:45.434 --> 48:48.467
Officer Miles' safety is paramount.

48:48.643 --> 48:50.428
Hold your positions.

48:53.766 --> 48:55.589
No, don't leave me!

48:56.360 --> 48:57.720
Listen to me!

48:58.239 --> 49:01.559
- Franky, we have to stop them.
- They've made their decision, Kaz.

49:01.565 --> 49:03.661
- FERGUSON: Stop!
- (Kaz gasps)

49:04.707 --> 49:06.238
INMATE: String her up!

49:06.976 --> 49:09.208
Yep, pull on the rope. Pull on it!

49:12.572 --> 49:15.236
(Ferguson grunts and gasps)

49:15.588 --> 49:18.689
No! No!

49:18.695 --> 49:21.066
KAZ: Stop it! Get her down!

49:22.142 --> 49:23.542
(gate beeps unlocked)

49:23.548 --> 49:25.433
- Vera, what about Linda?
- They're bluffing.

49:25.439 --> 49:27.136
Don't fucking touch me!

49:27.142 --> 49:28.564
Latham, drop the shiv!

49:28.735 --> 49:30.509
What the hell is she doing?

49:30.626 --> 49:32.411
- Back off or I'll cut her throat!
- VERA: Get...!

49:32.417 --> 49:36.107
You've got two months or you
want 20 years?! Drop the shiv.

49:36.113 --> 49:38.613
- (shouting and jeering)
- (Ferguson gagging)

49:39.986 --> 49:41.253
- (gags)
- (rope creaking)

49:47.590 --> 49:49.121
(keys jangle)

49:51.560 --> 49:53.144
Drop it!

49:53.844 --> 49:55.074
- (shiv clatters)
- Oh!

49:55.080 --> 49:56.474
MALE GUARD: All right, that's it!

49:58.189 --> 50:00.343
(Vera grunting)

50:00.840 --> 50:02.348
MALE GUARD: Get back!
