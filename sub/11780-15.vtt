WE ARE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH NOTHING.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.527
- YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BEAT YOU.

EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

IT'S A BIT JUVENILE.

YOU DON'T LOVE WHAT YOU DO.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.827
TATTOOING JASON'S DESIGN.

NOT ENOUGH CONTRAST

01:38.181 --> 01:39.682
TO THIS PERSON'S SKIN TONE
TO MAKE IT WORTHWHILE

01:39.766 --> 01:40.975

01:41.059 --> 01:43.686
STABBING THIS GUY WITH A NEEDLE.

TEALS AND STUFF.
- YEAH.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.881
- CAN WE PUT IT ON YOUR LEG?
- YEAH.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.633
- YOU'RE COOL
WITH GETTING IT THERE?

09:10.716 --> 09:12.051
- YEAH, TOTALLY.
ABSOLUTELY, 100%.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.427
- DUDE, YOU'RE SAVING MY LIFE.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.221
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW, BRO.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.764
- IT'S OKAY, MAN.
I APPRECIATE THIS.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.766
IT'S ALL GOOD.
- [exhales]

09:18.849 --> 09:20.017
DUDE, I GOT TO STOP
SHAKING FOR A SECOND, BRO.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.602
- DUDE, IT'S ALL GOOD.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.646
- THANKS, MAN.
- NO PROBLEM.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.064
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS TO PROVE
YOUR VERSATILITY.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.190
YOUR SPOT IN THE LIVE FINALE

09:26.274 --> 09:28.067
IS ON THE LINE,

09:28.150 --> 09:32.154
AND YOUR TIME
STARTS NOW.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.115
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.408
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.784
{\an8}- EVERYTHING WE'VE CHALLENGED

09:36.867 --> 09:38.327
{\an8}THROUGHOUT
THIS ENTIRE COMPETITION

09:38.411 --> 09:40.413
{\an8}COMES INTO PLAY
IN THESE FINAL TATTOOS.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.414
THEY SHOULD BE
THE FOUR BEST TATTOOS

09:41.664 --> 09:43.499
THE ENTIRE COMPETITION.

09:43.582 --> 09:44.875
- GAME TIME.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.211
[tattoo machines buzzing]

09:52.925 --> 09:55.428
- DUDE, I SWEAR THE UNIVERSE
BROUGHT YOU TO ME, JOHN.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.138
- HOW ABOUT THE MEANING OF JUST,
LIKE, HELPING OUT SOMEBODY

09:57.221 --> 09:58.431
WHEN THEY NEED YOU?

09:58.514 --> 09:59.265
- THAT'S COOL TOO, MAN.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.475
WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW,

10:01.559 --> 10:03.060
THIS IS
YOUR GOOD FORTUNE TATTOO, MAN.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.438
{\an8}THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.356
{\an8}SOMEBODY, THANK YOU.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.191
ALL I NEED TO DO IS
SHAKE THESE NERVES OFF.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.277
LUCKY FOR ME,
I'VE TATTOOED MANY TIMES

10:11.360 --> 10:13.404
WHILE HAVING A PANIC ATTACK,
SO I CAN HANDLE THIS.

10:13.487 --> 10:14.697
I JUST NEED TO REALLY FOCUS
AND GET INTO THE FINALE.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.994
- FOUR HOURS REMAINING.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.875
- I FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE REALLY--

10:25.958 --> 10:27.793
DONE REALLY WELL SO FAR.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.338
{\an8}I'VE BEEN THE FRONT-RUNNER IN
THIS WHOLE ENTIRE COMPETITION.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.465
THIS IS MY WHEELHOUSE
RIGHT HERE.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.800
CLEEN ROCK ONE
GOING TO THE FINALE, HANDS DOWN.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.096
- TWO MORE HOURS.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.393
- THIS IS MAKE IT OR BREAK IT
RIGHT HERE.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.187
{\an8}NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO PLAY IT SAFE.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.564
- WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?

10:48.647 --> 10:51.484
- TRADITIONAL SNAKE
AND TITTY SKULL.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.819
I'M TATTOOING AN AMERICAN
TRADITIONAL SKULL AND SNAKE,

10:53.903 --> 10:55.821
BUT IT'S NOT
YOUR MAMA'S SKULL AND SNAKE,

10:55.905 --> 10:58.491
BECAUSE I CHANGED THE SKULL
INTO A NAKED LADY.

10:58.574 --> 10:59.575
I FIGURED
WE'VE DONE ENOUGH SKULLS.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.160
I'M SWINGING FOR THE FENCES.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.371
I'M GONNA HIT A HOME RUN.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.414
I'M GONNA SHOW THESE JUDGES
I NEED TO BE IN THE FINALE.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.834
{\an8}- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
A TRADITIONAL SKULL AND SNAKE,

11:08.918 --> 11:12.630
{\an8}AND YET YOU GIVE ME
SOME BUBBLEGUM-COLORED DESIGN

11:12.713 --> 11:14.090
{\an8}THAT DOESN'T EVEN
LOOK LIKE A SKULL?

11:16.384 --> 11:19.220
IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.097
- 30 MINUTES REMAINING.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.436
{\an8}- THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
TATTOO OF MY CAREER.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.397
I'M JUST GONNA FINISH
THESE PETALS,

11:29.480 --> 11:31.440
AND THEN I'LL FINISH THE LEAVES.
- OKAY.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.442
- I CAME HERE FOR ONE THING
AND ONE THING ONLY,

11:33.526 --> 11:35.319
AND THAT'S TO WIN $100,000
AND BECOME INK MASTER.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.363
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:37.446 --> 11:40.324
- I'M HERE TO WIN,
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

11:40.408 --> 11:45.454
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.664
THAT'S IT.
TIME'S UP.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.873
MACHINES DOWN.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.000
NO MORE TATTOOING.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.043
- ALL RIGHT, DUDE.
THAT'S IT.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.837
I'M DONE.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.380
- GOT A WINNER?
- YEAH, GOT A WINNER.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.464
OH, MY GOD.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.466
- OH, YEAH, MAN.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.260
- OH, MY GOD.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.386
IT LOOKS GREAT, DUDE.
WOW.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.263
- AWESOME, MAN.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.181
- JASON'S TATTOO HAS
A LITTLE BABY HAND.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.599
{\an8}HE NEEDS TO BE WORRIED ABOUT
LOSING HIS SPOT IN THE FINALE

12:05.683 --> 12:08.060
{\an8}AND GOING HOME.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.478
{\an8}- IF YOU KNEW HOW TO TATTOO,

12:09.562 --> 12:10.604
{\an8}YOU'D HAVE [bleep] INK
IN THE SKIN,

12:10.688 --> 12:12.064
{\an8}BUT YOU DON'T!

12:12.148 --> 12:14.024
{\an8}- OKAY, YOU EGOTISTICAL PRICK.
[bleep].

12:14.108 --> 12:15.609
- I GOT [bleep] CRAZINESS
WITH THIS TATTOO.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.153
- YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING WRONG.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.529
- BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.788
- I'M HAPPY WITH MY TATTOO.
IT'S OKAY.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.498
- YEAH, I DEFINITELY THINK
IT'S OKAY.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.417
- WELL, LET'S HEAR IT.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.377
YOU OBVIOUSLY SOUND LIKE YOU GOT
A LOT OF [bleep] TO TALK.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.337
- FROM WHAT I SAW,

12:35.421 --> 12:37.506
EVERYBODY KIND OF JUST
DID A BASIC, OLD TATTOO.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.508
I WASN'T IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR BLACK AND GRAY.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.635
I WASN'T REALLY IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR APPLICATION.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.512
I WASN'T IMPRESSED
WITH JASON'S DRAWING.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.639
- I THINK YOURS WAS
A LITTLE LACKLUSTER.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.599
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THAT BACKGROUND,

12:46.682 --> 12:48.517
HONESTLY, DUDE.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.644
- IT'S NEW SCHOOL
LIKE A MOTHER[bleep], MAN.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.937
- I DEFINITELY THINK
MY TATTOO'S BETTER THAN MARK'S.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.731
THE TATTOO WAS A BIG RISK.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.191
I THINK YOU TRIED
SOME CRAZY STUFF.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.026
- HE SAID TO TAKE SOME RISKS.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.444
- WELL...
- I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH IT.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.154
- I JUST DON'T THINK RIGHT NOW

13:00.237 --> 13:02.198
IS THE TIME
FOR YOU TO TAKE RISKS.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.492
- I'LL HOLD MY OWN DOWN THERE
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.410
- YOU CAN KEEP YOUR FIGHT GOING
ALL THE WAY TO THE BUS STATION.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.370
- I ALWAYS KNOW THERE'S ONE
WORSE THAN MINE

13:08.454 --> 13:09.663
EVERY TIME I GO DOWN,
AND THAT ONE IS ERIK'S.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.582
I KNOW THAT MINE'S BETTER, SO...

13:11.665 --> 13:12.666
- KEEP GRASPING FOR STRAWS,
MARK.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.627
- I KNOW THAT'S ALL.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.504
- WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOING HOME,
AND IT AIN'T ME.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.172
- I THINK I'M GOING
TO THE FINALE.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.423
- I KNOW I'M GOING
TO THE FINALE.

13:19.507 --> 13:19.715
I HIT A HOME RUN, MAN.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.606
- THIS WEEK, YOU HAD TO PROVE

13:35.689 --> 13:38.901
THAT YOU COULD TAKE ON
ANY CHALLENGE AND PERSEVERE.

13:38.984 --> 13:43.572
A TRIP TO THE LIVE FINALE
IS ON THE LINE.

13:43.822 --> 13:47.618
CLEEN, LET'S START WITH YOU.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.037
YOU PULLED THE NEW-SCHOOL TIGER.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.540
- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS STYLE
FOR 15 YEARS.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.000
I TRIED TO BRING EVERY TRICK
I HAD IN MY BAG ON THIS ONE.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.086
- YOUR LINES, SUPER CRISP.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.046
YOUR BLACK, SOLID.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.589
YOU GOT SOME GREAT
LITTLE DETAILS IN THE GUMS

14:00.673 --> 14:02.550
AND THE TEETH AND THE TONGUE,

14:02.633 --> 14:04.426
AND YOUR BLENDS
FROM ORANGE TO YELLOW

14:04.510 --> 14:06.303
AND FROM BLUE TO WHITE--
SEAMLESS, MAN.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.388
YOU TOTALLY NAILED IT.

14:07.471 --> 14:07.972
- THANK YOU.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.979
- JASON.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.273
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAD TROUBLE
WITH YOUR FIRST CANVAS.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.732
HOW WAS YOUR HEAD
GOING INTO THIS?

14:18.816 --> 14:20.526
- I WAS FREAKING OUT.

14:20.609 --> 14:21.610
I'M TRYING TO GET
IN THE TOP THREE,

14:21.694 --> 14:23.654
AND THEN THAT HAPPENS?

14:23.737 --> 14:24.655
IT TOOK ME A WHILE
TO KIND OF CALM DOWN,

14:24.905 --> 14:26.156
BUT I DID THE BEST I COULD.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.783
- YES, YOU DID A GEISHA,

14:28.033 --> 14:29.410
BUT YES,
THIS GEISHA HAS MANY PROBLEMS.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.662
HER FACE IS AS BOLD AS HER ROBE,

14:31.912 --> 14:34.290
AND WHEN WE REALLY GET
INTO TRADITIONAL JAPANESE,

14:34.373 --> 14:36.166
THE GARMENT IS THE BOLDEST,

14:36.250 --> 14:37.585
AND EVERYTHING TRICKLES DOWN
FROM THERE,

14:37.668 --> 14:39.461
WHICH GIVES US OUR SEPARATION.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.629
YOU CAN'T HAVE SAME LINE WEIGHT
IN A FACE

14:40.713 --> 14:42.590
THAT YOU DO IN A GARMENT.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.466
- THE THINGS THAT STAND OUT
TO ME

14:44.550 --> 14:45.718
AS BEING AWKWARD IS
THAT LITTLE, TINY HAND

14:45.801 --> 14:47.720
THAT'S PEEKING OUT.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.597
THAT HAND DOES NOT LOOK LIKE
IT GOES WITH THIS PERSON.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.514
MAN, I THINK
THIS TATTOO IS OKAY.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.558
I DON'T THINK IT'S AMAZING.

14:56.270 --> 15:00.065
- ERIK.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.527
YOU PULLED A ROSE AND A DAGGER,
BLACK AND GRAY.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.571
- FIRST OFF, I THINK YOU'VE GOT
A VERY CLEAN OUTLINE HERE,

15:05.654 --> 15:07.364
AND YOU DO HAVE
SOME SMOOTH SHADING.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.199
I LIKE THE ADDITION
OF THE WINGS.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.327
IT GIVES IT BALANCE
FOR THE TOP SHAPE.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.704
BUT THINK BACK TO THE
BLACK-AND-GRAY DAY CHALLENGE.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.540
THE NUMBER ONE KEY WORD
WE WERE LOOKING FOR IS CONTRAST.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.668
THIS TATTOO IS ONE TONE
THROUGHOUT.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.128
THERE'S EXACTLY
THE SAME AMOUNT OF BLACK

15:21.211 --> 15:22.755
AND THE SAME AMOUNT OF GRAY

15:23.005 --> 15:24.715
IN THE BLADE
AS THERE IS IN THE ROSE.

15:24.798 --> 15:25.799
IT ALL GETS LOST.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.468
- JUST THE HANDLE OF THE BLADE--

15:27.551 --> 15:29.261
IF YOU WOULD'VE PUT BLACK

15:29.345 --> 15:30.638
WITH A NICE SHINE
DOWN THE CENTER--

15:30.721 --> 15:32.306
DIFFERENT-LOOKING TATTOO.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.849
YOU MISSED IT.

15:37.519 --> 15:37.936
- MARK.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.359
- A SKULL AND A SNAKE,

15:43.442 --> 15:45.694
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON,
TRADITIONAL IMAGES.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.821
WHAT DID I GET?
CRAZINESS.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.783
I GOT [bleep] CRAZINESS
WITH THIS TATTOO.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.660
YOU SHOW THIS IMAGE TO
A PERSON ON THE STREET,

15:52.743 --> 15:54.244
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SAY
IT'S A SKULL.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.413
YOUR OUTLINE--SOME PROBLEMS.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.832
THE ONE BREAST THAT'S TOWARDS
THE CENTER OF THE TATTOO

15:58.916 --> 16:00.834
IS A BIG, WOBBLY BLOWOUT.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.878
THE HAIR IS GOING UP
INTO THE EYES,

16:02.961 --> 16:04.546
MAKING IT
LOOK LESS LIKE A SKULL.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.839
- I DID MY TAKE ON IT.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.758
- THIS ISN'T "YOUR TAKE" DAY.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.677
IT'S NOT
MARK LONGENECKER TAT DAY.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.595
IT'S AMERICAN TRADITIONAL
SKULL AND SNAKE.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.805
- I UNDERSTAND THAT
THIS IS YOUR SPECIALTY,

16:13.055 --> 16:14.848
SO I KIND OF EXPECTED IT.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.725
- WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING
WHERE YOU EXPECT THAT?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.352
YOU KNOW HOW TO DO TRADITIONAL.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.395
- DEFINITELY.
- JUST DO IT.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.813
JUST WIN.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.731
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.

16:22.815 --> 16:22.981
- WELL, THEN,
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING WRONG.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.944
- JUDGES,

16:27.027 --> 16:29.446
WHO HAD THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.699
- WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK
AT CLEEN'S TATTOO,

16:31.782 --> 16:33.784
THERE'S TRICKS IN THE TONGUE,
THERE'S TRICKS IN THE GUMS,

16:33.867 --> 16:36.286
THERE'S SMOOTH BLENDING,
THERE'S A STRONG OUTLINE.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.746
- FINAL DECISION.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.956
- CLEEN.
- CLEEN.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.541
- CLEEN.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.459
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.879
CLEEN, YOU HAVE
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.923
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.342
YOU HAVE ALSO

16:50.426 --> 16:53.762
EARNED YOUR SPOT
IN THE LIVE FINALE.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.765
- OH, MY GOD.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.934
- THE OVERALL BODY OF WORK
AND THE CONSISTENCY--

16:59.017 --> 17:00.394
I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY CAN DENY THE FACT

17:00.477 --> 17:02.312
THAT YOU'RE A SOLID TATTOOER,

17:02.396 --> 17:04.647
AND THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK
TO GET TO THIS SPOT.

17:04.732 --> 17:05.898
- OH, MY GOD.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.859
IS THIS FOR REAL RIGHT NOW?

17:07.943 --> 17:09.653
- YOU'RE GOING, MAN.
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.864
- I'M A LITTLE OVERWHELMED
RIGHT NOW.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.699
- IT'S A LONG ROAD
GETTING TO THIS POINT.

17:13.781 --> 17:15.826
- I'M HAPPY FOR YOU,
AND I'M GLAD TO SEE

17:15.909 --> 17:18.871
A STRONG TATTOOER
IN THE FINALE.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.874
- ERIK, JASON, AND MARK,

17:21.957 --> 17:23.876
THERE ARE THREE OF YOU LEFT,

17:23.959 --> 17:25.877
BUT ONLY TWO SPOTS REMAIN
IN THE FINALE.

17:25.961 --> 17:29.006
YOU'LL HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE

17:29.089 --> 17:32.718
TO PROVE THAT YOU DESERVE
ONE OF THOSE SPOTS.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.928
TWO OF YOU WILL MOVE ON
TO COMPLETE WITH CLEEN

17:35.012 --> 17:37.973
IN THE LIVE FINALE FOR $100,000,

17:38.057 --> 17:42.269
AND ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.229
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT

17:44.313 --> 17:45.105
AND PREPARE FOR
YOUR NEXT ELIMINATION TATTOO.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.710
- WELCOME, ARTISTS.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.421
CLEEN, YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR SPOT
IN THE LIVE FINALE.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.299
JASON, MARK, AND ERIK,

18:12.382 --> 18:15.719
TODAY YOU HAVE ONE FINAL TATTOO

18:15.803 --> 18:18.680
TO DETERMINE
WHO GOES TO THE FINALE

18:18.764 --> 18:21.016
AND WHO PACKS THEIR MACHINES.

18:21.099 --> 18:25.938
EVERYTHING DEPENDS
ON THIS TATTOO.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.274
<i>INK MASTER</i> IS BUILT
ON PROVING YOUR VERSATILITY.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.027
YOU MUST BE ABLE TO HANDLE
ANYTHING THAT COMES YOUR WAY.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.987
ALL SEASON LONG,

18:34.071 --> 18:35.823
YOU'VE BEEN TATTOOING
HEAD-TO-HEAD,

18:35.906 --> 18:37.574
GIVING AN APPLES-TO-APPLES
COMPARISON.

18:37.658 --> 18:42.579
THIS IS
THE FINAL HEAD-TO-HEAD TATTOO.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.581
{\an8}- THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
HEAD-TO-HEAD I'VE EVER DONE.

18:44.665 --> 18:45.874
{\an8}I'VE GOT TO BEAT THESE GUYS,

18:45.958 --> 18:47.835
{\an8}LOCK UP MY SEAT IN THE FINALE.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.462
- EACH OF YOU MUST DRAW A SKULL.

18:50.546 --> 18:54.007
ONE SKULL IS MARKED.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.884
IF YOU GET THE MARKED SKULL,

18:55.968 --> 18:57.636
YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO PICK THE SUBJECT

18:57.719 --> 18:59.972
THAT ALL THREE OF YOU

19:00.055 --> 19:03.058
MUST TATTOO.

19:03.141 --> 19:04.977
- WHOA.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.979
- THIS COULD TIP THE SCALES
IN YOUR FAVOR

19:07.062 --> 19:09.022
AND ALTER THE COURSE
OF THE ENTIRE COMPETITION.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.775
{\an8}- TO HAVE THIS MUCH POWER AT
THIS POINT IN THE COMPETITION,

19:11.859 --> 19:13.777
{\an8}IT'S HUGE.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.487
- YOU'VE BEEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNED
A PICKING ORDER.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.072
ERIK, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.036
- IF JASON OR ERIK GETS TO PICK
THE SUBJECT MATTER,

19:23.120 --> 19:24.371
HOLY [bleep],
THAT COULD TOTALLY SCREW ME.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.459
- JASON, YOU'RE NEXT.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.054
- X MARKS THE SPOT.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.931
- [laughs]

19:43.015 --> 19:45.100
I GET TO PICK WHATEVER I WANT
TO WIN THIS.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.020
- THIS SUCKS.
THAT WAS MY KEY TO THE FINALE.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.397
- JASON, YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER

19:50.480 --> 19:52.608
TO HELP DETERMINE YOUR FATE.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.109
YOU MUST PICK THE SUBJECT

19:54.192 --> 19:56.945
OF THE LAST ELIMINATION TATTOO.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.406
- AT THIS POINT,
ANY OF YOU GUYS COULD MAKE IT,

19:59.489 --> 20:01.366
AND ANY OF YOU COULD GO HOME.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.118
SO CHOOSE WISELY.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.953
- EVERY GUY HERE IS
GONNA EXPECT ME

20:05.037 --> 20:06.538
TO DO
SOME SORT OF A JAPANESE DESIGN.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.290
- JASON, WHAT IS YOUR DECISION?

20:11.043 --> 20:14.630
- BIRDS.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.715
I'M A BADASS
WHEN IT COMES TO REALISM.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.509
I CAN KICK THEIR ASS
BY DOING A SIMPLE BIRD.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.094
- I TATTOO BIRDS ALL THE TIME.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.096
{\an8}THANKS A LOT
FOR MAKING IT EASY FOR ME.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.765
- PROVE YOU'RE VERSATILE,
AND YOU ARE GUARANTEED

20:24.848 --> 20:26.892
A SPOT IN THE FINAL THREE.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.310
HEAD TO YOUR SHOPS
AND MEET YOUR CANVASES.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.269
GOOD LUCK.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.106
{\an8}- BIRDS ARE GREAT IMAGES
TO TATTOO.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.692
{\an8}THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT
RENDITIONS THAT YOU CAN DO.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.819
- LIKE A BIRD OF PREY?
- OKAY.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.655
- BUT NO MATTER WHAT,

20:39.738 --> 20:40.989
THESE GUYS ARE FIGHTING
FOR THEIR LIVES,

20:41.073 --> 20:43.116
SO THIS TATTOO HAS TO BE

20:43.200 --> 20:45.077
THE BEST TATTOO THEY'VE DONE
THIS ENTIRE COMPETITION.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.662
- I LIKE THIS.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.080
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT GUY?

20:48.163 --> 20:49.998
ERIK AND MARK HAVE TO GO DOWN,

20:50.082 --> 20:54.002
SO I'M GONNA DO ALL THIS
HYPER DETAIL AND KICK ASS.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.379
- I'M REALLY EXCITED.

20:55.462 --> 20:57.005
A BIG, BRIGHT, BEAUTIFUL PEACOCK

20:57.255 --> 20:59.132
WILL WORK GREAT
WITH MY CANVAS'S BODY

20:59.216 --> 21:00.133
AND SHOW ALL SORTS
OF GOOD COLORS.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.052
- YOU GONNA WIN?

21:02.135 --> 21:02.427
- I DIDN'T GET THIS FAR
FOR NOTHING.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.349
- OH, HERE WE GO.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.184
- THREE SPOTS LEFT,
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO

21:09.267 --> 21:10.936
A LITTLE BIRD
SITTING ON A BRANCH?

21:11.019 --> 21:13.897
{\an8}CONSIDERING THAT JASON
CHOSE TO TATTOO A BIRD,

21:13.981 --> 21:17.150
{\an8}I KIND OF ASSUMED
THAT HE HAS THIS AMAZING IDEA.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.527
- YOU GUYS ARE OBVIOUSLY
GIVING ME THE LOOK

21:18.610 --> 21:20.112
LIKE I'M MAKING A POOR CHOICE.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.030
- WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.074
- JASON, IF YOU PULL IT OFF
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A PHOTO

21:24.324 --> 21:26.201
AND IT'S AMAZING, THEN
IT'LL GIVE YOU A FAIR FIGHT.

21:26.284 --> 21:28.620
BUT IF IT'S OFF THE PHOTO

21:28.704 --> 21:29.997
AND YOU DON'T NAIL IT,

21:30.080 --> 21:32.249
YOU'RE [bleep].

21:32.332 --> 21:34.126
- I THOUGHT OUR LAST TATTOO
WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE.

21:34.376 --> 21:38.171
THIS ONE BEATS IT TRIPLE FOLD.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.048
- YOU SURE YOU CAN BEAT
THESE GUYS WITH THAT?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.426
- I THINK THAT'S THE BEST BIRD
I CAN DO.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.594
- IT'S PRETTY STIFF.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.596
- IT WOULD SUCK SO BAD TO WORK
THIS HARD AND GET THIS FAR

21:46.680 --> 21:48.598
AND GO HOME AT THIS POINT.

21:48.682 --> 21:48.724
- PICK SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN FIGHT THEM WITH.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.070
- GENTLEMEN, THIS IS IT.

22:02.154 --> 22:06.241
YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A BIRD IN ANY STYLE.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.118
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE

22:08.368 --> 22:10.245
TO PROVE THAT YOU DESERVE A SPOT

22:10.328 --> 22:14.124
IN THE LIVE FINALE.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.375
AND YOUR TIME

22:15.459 --> 22:18.587
STARTS NOW.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.714
- ALL RIGHT.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.424
- ONE MORE TATTOO STANDS
BETWEEN THESE THREE ARTISTS

22:22.507 --> 22:24.092
AND THE FINALE.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.011
- YOU WANT HIM GOING DOWN

22:26.094 --> 22:27.262
OR A LITTLE BIT, LIKE,
UP LIKE THAT?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.555
- I REALLY JUST WANT TO SEE

22:28.638 --> 22:30.599
A LOT OF DYNAMIC FEATURES.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.184
THEY REALLY ARE GONNA HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING AMAZING

22:32.434 --> 22:34.352
TO MAKE IT TO THE END.

22:38.565 --> 22:39.775
- WHAT KIND OF BIRD IS THIS?

22:39.858 --> 22:40.859
- CALLED THE BEE-EATER.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.110
- BEE-EATER?

22:42.194 --> 22:43.528
- I KNOW I'M TAKING A HUGE RISK

22:43.612 --> 22:45.739
BY NOT LISTENING TO THE JUDGES.

22:45.822 --> 22:48.283
I CHOSE A REALISTIC PIECE
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T BE HAVING TO

22:48.533 --> 22:50.035
DO A LOT OF OUTLINE WORK.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.537
SO NOW
EVERYTHING IN THIS TATTOO

22:52.621 --> 22:54.831
HAS TO BE PERFECT.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.917
- WHAT'S UP WITH THAT ONE LINE?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.585
- THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S GETTING
ME INTO THE FINALE.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.462
- OH, YOU KNOW, JUST ASKING.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.922
- I'M SURPRISED YOU FIT
THROUGH THIS DOOR

23:02.005 --> 23:03.215
WITH THAT BIG-ASS HEAD OF YOURS.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.633
- YOU HAVE THREE MORE HOURS.

23:08.386 --> 23:10.222
I WAS ORIGINALLY GONNA DO
A BIG PEACOCK

23:10.305 --> 23:12.224
WITH THE FEATHERS
GOING DOWN THE LEG,

23:12.307 --> 23:13.308
BUT I CHANGED IT
TO A COLORFUL PARROT.

23:13.391 --> 23:14.434
- PARROT IN FLIGHT?

23:14.518 --> 23:16.311
MUCH MORE DYNAMIC.

23:16.394 --> 23:16.812
- VERY DYNAMIC, COLORFUL,
AND BOLD.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.233
- SLOWLY MAKING SOME PROGRESS.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.152
I'M TATTOOING A COLORED HAWK
ON MY CANVAS'S SHOULDER BLADE.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.738
IT'S DYNAMIC, SOLID OUTLINING,
SOLID SHADING,

23:26.822 --> 23:28.698
AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY
OF ARTISTRY.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.700
ALL RIGHT, SO NO B.S.
HOW'S IT LOOKING?

23:30.784 --> 23:32.702
- IT'S CRAZY BECAUSE
MARK'S BEEN AT THE BOTTOM

23:32.786 --> 23:34.663
SO MANY TIMES,

23:34.746 --> 23:36.414
AND NOW HERE IT IS,
JUDGMENT DAY,

23:36.498 --> 23:38.667
AND I HONESTLY THINK
THAT HIS TATTOO

23:38.750 --> 23:41.169
LOOKS BETTER THAN THE ONE
THAT JASON'S DOING.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.296
- RIGHT NOW, I'M ABOUT TO PROVE
A [bleep] POINT.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.256
I KNOW I'M GONNA BLOW THEM
OUT OF THE WATER.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.799
- THERE'S ONLY TWO SPOTS.

23:45.882 --> 23:47.884
- I ONLY WANT ONE OF 'EM.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.720
- AND I WOULD BE NERVOUS
IF I WAS JASON RIGHT NOW.

23:50.804 --> 23:53.348
- JUST GOTTA GO THROUGH AND
DETAIL THE [bleep] OUT OF IT.

23:53.431 --> 23:54.599
THIS IS IT.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.268
{\an8}THIS IS MY LAST OPPORTUNITY

23:56.351 --> 23:58.186
{\an8}TO KICK EVERYBODY'S ASS
IN THIS COMPETITION.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.563
- DOWN THE HOMESTRETCH NOW.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.565
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

24:01.648 --> 24:02.816
AT THIS POINT,

24:02.899 --> 24:04.776
EVERYONE'S MY RIVAL,

24:04.860 --> 24:06.278
AND NOT ONE OF THEM
IS GONNA STAND IN MY WAY

24:06.361 --> 24:08.989
TO GET TO THE FINALE.

24:09.072 --> 24:10.240
- [groans]

24:10.323 --> 24:11.241
- HOLD THE TEARS IN,

24:11.491 --> 24:13.076
AND WE'LL GET THIS THING DONE.

24:13.160 --> 24:19.082
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.168
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.880
NO MORE TATTOOING.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.632
- I KNOW I DESERVE THAT SPOT
'CAUSE I'M A FIGHTER.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.343
- SO COLORFUL.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.845
- JASON DEFINITELY NEEDS
TO BE WORRIED.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.221
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, MIKE?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.348
- THAT'S FREAKING AWESOME.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.225
- HE HAD THE ADVANTAGE,
AND HE DID A BORING-ASS BIRD.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.351
NOW HE'S GONNA GO HOME.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.313
- [exhales]

24:41.396 --> 24:43.315
OH, MAN.

24:43.398 --> 24:45.358
- JASON'S TATTOO HAD
A LOT OF BLOWOUTS.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.152
YOURS WAS DEFINITELY SOLIDER.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.404
AND EVEN IF HE DOES BEAT YOU,

24:49.487 --> 24:51.239
IF HE'S GONNA BRING [bleep]
LIKE THAT TO THE FINALE...

24:51.323 --> 24:52.866
[scoffs]

24:52.949 --> 24:54.242
AWESOME.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.077
I'M GONNA CASH THE CHECK.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.787
- SO HOW MANY TIMES
YOU GONNA SIT HERE

24:57.871 --> 24:59.206
AND TALK [bleep]
ABOUT MY TATTOO?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.041
YOU'RE A [bleep] DICK, DUDE.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.084
- DUDE, I SAT THERE
AND WATCHED YOU--

25:03.168 --> 25:04.878
- WHEN YOU--LISTEN.
- I WATCHED YOU SCRUB IT IN

25:04.961 --> 25:06.963
LIKE THIS:
[imitates tattoo machine]

25:07.047 --> 25:09.007
- YOU KNOW WHAT, BRO?
JUST SHUT THE [bleep] UP, MAN.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.884
- HEY, IS ANYBODY--HEY, HEY.
- YOU WALK UP ON ME,

25:10.967 --> 25:12.969
AND YOU ASK ME THAT, DUDE--
- HEY, MARK.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.429
IS ANYBODY TELLING ME
THAT MY TATTOOS AIN'T SOLID?

25:14.512 --> 25:16.264
ANYBODY?
- HEY, DUDE.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.350
NO, BUT I'M TELLING--I'M--
- ANYBODY?

25:18.433 --> 25:20.310
NAME ONE PERSON IN
THIS WHOLE [bleep] THAT SAYS...

25:20.393 --> 25:22.187
- YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO LISTEN,
DUDE.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.189
- "HEY, CLEEN,
YOUR TATTOOS AREN'T SOLID."

25:24.272 --> 25:26.149
- HOW MANY TIMES
DO I GOT TO [bleep] TELL YOU?

25:26.233 --> 25:28.026
YOU'RE JUST--NO.
- CRYING AND CRYING AND CRYING

25:28.109 --> 25:29.778
BECAUSE--
- I'M NOT CRYING ABOUT NOTHING.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.279
- BECAUSE HE DID A BAD TATTOO.
- OKAY.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.365
YOU EGOTISTICAL PRICK.
[bleep].

25:33.657 --> 25:34.950
- YOU'RE THE ONE THAT DID
A TATTOO THAT'S NOT SATURATED!

25:35.033 --> 25:37.160
IF YOU KNEW HOW TO TATTOO,

25:37.244 --> 25:38.828
YOU'D HAVE SOME [bleep] INK
IN THE SKIN, BUT YOU DON'T!

25:38.912 --> 25:40.205
- IF I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TATTOO,

25:40.288 --> 25:41.164
I WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE

25:41.248 --> 25:42.832
WITH YOU GOING TO THE FINALE.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.584
- HEY, YOU'RE NOT GOING YET.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.002
HOW MANY TIMES WERE YOU
AT THE BOTTOM?

25:46.086 --> 25:47.379
- HAVE I WON OVERALL ON YOU?

25:47.462 --> 25:48.380
THEN SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.382
HAVE YOU WON OVERALL ON HIM?

25:50.465 --> 25:52.259
HAVE YOU WON OVERALL
ON HIM?

25:52.342 --> 25:54.344
NOBODY'S WON OVERALL ON YOU
EXCEPT FOR ME.

25:54.427 --> 25:55.387
- I MEAN, WHATEVER, MAN.
BE BUTTHURT ALL YOU WANT.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.305
- JUST LET IT GO.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.265
- I'M ONLY CALLING 'EM
AS I SEE 'EM.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.016
- DICK.

26:13.571 --> 26:17.450
{\an8}- I NEEDED TO PROVE A POINT
THAT I BELONG IN THE FINALE.

26:13.571 --> 26:17.450
- TODAY, YOU ALL WENT
HEAD-TO-HEAD TATTOOING A BIRD.

26:17.534 --> 26:20.745
THIS WAS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO OUT-TATTOO YOUR RIVALS

26:20.829 --> 26:22.580
AND PROVE THAT YOU DESERVE
A SPOT IN THE LIVE FINALE.

26:26.584 --> 26:30.880
ERIK, LET'S START WITH YOU.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.133
IS THIS THE TATTOO THAT'S GONNA

26:33.216 --> 26:35.343
PUT YOU IN THE RUNNING
FOR $100,000?

26:35.427 --> 26:37.345
- I NEEDED TO PROVE A POINT
THAT I BELONG IN THE FINALE,

26:37.429 --> 26:39.347
AND I THINK WITH THIS TATTOO,
I DID THAT.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.266
- THIS THING COULD'VE GONE SOUTH
REALLY EASY,

26:41.349 --> 26:42.434
BUT I THINK YOU PULLED IT OFF.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.102
PLACEMENT IN THIS DESIGN

26:44.185 --> 26:46.354
IS A VERY IMPORTANT CHALLENGE.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.399
WITH THIS POSE, I REALLY LOVE
HOW IT'S SWOOPING STRAIGHT UP.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.443
I THINK IT FITS THE SHOULDER
REALLY NICE.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.862
- THE COLOR CHOICE RIGHT
ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE BEAK

26:53.945 --> 26:55.905
GOING INTO THE BLUE
IS VERY NICE.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.449
THE LITTLE FUR THAT YOU DID
COMING OFF OF THE HEAD

26:57.532 --> 26:58.450
LOOKS GREAT,

26:58.742 --> 26:59.951
AND THE TALONS ARE STRONG, MAN.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.119
THIS WAS A GOOD CHOICE.

27:01.202 --> 27:01.870
- THANK YOU.

27:05.832 --> 27:07.542
- JASON.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.504
- THE DETAIL IN THIS IS GREAT.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.381
THE BEAK AND THE EYE--

27:13.465 --> 27:15.258
THE LITTLE FEATHERS
IN THE TOP OF THE WING

27:15.342 --> 27:17.093
WHERE THEY HAVE DEFINITION
FROM THE LIGHT GREEN HIGHLIGHTS

27:17.177 --> 27:18.970
IS VERY NICE.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.347
I JUST WISH
IT WAS A MORE DYNAMIC POSE.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.473
IT'S A VERY DOCILE IMAGE.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.516
- I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.893
- THE THREE OF US
STRONGLY URGED YOU

27:24.976 --> 27:26.394
TO DO SOMETHING MORE DYNAMIC,

27:26.478 --> 27:28.855
AND YOU WERE UNWAVERING.

27:28.938 --> 27:30.273
- I JUST FEEL LIKE
NOT EVERYTHING

27:30.357 --> 27:32.275
NEEDS TO BE TOTALLY IN ACTION.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.152
- NO, I DON'T CARE
THAT YOUR IMAGE IS UNASSUMING,

27:34.235 --> 27:35.528
BUT YOU HAD
TO KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK,

27:35.612 --> 27:36.488
AND I DON'T SEE THIS THING

27:36.780 --> 27:38.031
BEING KNOCKED OUT OF THE PARK.

27:42.369 --> 27:45.455
- MARK.

27:45.538 --> 27:47.207
SO WHEN WE CAME INTO THE SHOP,

27:47.290 --> 27:49.501
YOU HAD A PEACOCK PERCHED.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.795
NOW YOU'VE MOVED
INTO A MORE DYNAMIC DESIGN.

27:51.878 --> 27:54.089
- I LISTENED TO YOU GUYS.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.383
I PUT IT IN FLIGHT, AND I WAS
HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN I PICKED.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.927
- I THINK THIS SHAPE IS A LOT
MORE FLATTERING TO THE LEG.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.388
THE SPREAD WINGS--
DEFINITELY MORE DYNAMIC.

28:01.471 --> 28:04.599
FROM A DISTANCE, THIS TATTOO HAS
A WOW FACTOR TO IT,

28:04.682 --> 28:06.351
BUT ON CLOSE INSPECTION, MAN,

28:06.434 --> 28:08.728
IT'S JUST NOT SOLID AND SMOOTH.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.313
THIS COLOR SATURATION
ON THIS YELLOW,

28:10.397 --> 28:12.524
IT'S VERY PATCHY,

28:12.607 --> 28:14.526
AND IT'S VERY INCONSISTENT
FROM ONE FEATHER TO THE NEXT.

28:14.609 --> 28:17.112
{\an8}- LOOK AT HOW CONSISTENT
ERIK'S WING LOOKS,

28:17.195 --> 28:18.446
{\an8}AND LOOK AT THE CONSISTENCY
IN YOUR WING.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.490
{\an8}IT'S JUST NIGHT AND DAY.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.659
I'VE GOT TO SAY, MAN,
I DON'T LOVE THIS TATTOO.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.497
- IT'S TIME TO POLL THE JUDGES

28:27.747 --> 28:30.250
FOR BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.544
{\an8}- WE'VE SEEN A DYNAMIC DESIGN
WITH WEAK DETAILS,

28:32.794 --> 28:35.130
{\an8}WE'VE SEEN A WEAK DESIGN
WITH NICE DETAILS,

28:35.213 --> 28:37.132
{\an8}AND THEN WE HAVE ONE DESIGN
THAT IS DYNAMIC,

28:37.215 --> 28:39.467
{\an8}AND IT'S EXECUTED NICELY.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.095
FOR ME,
ERIK'S TATTOO STANDS APART.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.138
- FINAL DECISION.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.472
- ERIK.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.640
- ERIK.
- ERIK.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.183
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

28:47.267 --> 28:48.768
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY

28:48.852 --> 28:50.145
GOES TO ERIK.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.646
YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR SPOT

28:51.729 --> 28:54.482
IN THE LIVE FINALE.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.568
JASON AND MARK,

28:56.860 --> 28:59.446
TWO OF YOU REMAIN,
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE SPOT LEFT

28:59.529 --> 29:01.197
IN THE FINALE.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.657
WE HAVE A HUGE DECISION
AHEAD OF US.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.617
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

29:04.701 --> 29:05.952
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

29:11.749 --> 29:13.626
- THIS IS OUR TIME TO FIGHT.

29:13.710 --> 29:14.502
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIGHT EACH OTHER.

29:14.752 --> 29:16.504
FIGHTING FOR THAT SPOT.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.672
- WHEN I'M DOWN IN THE RING,
DUDE,

29:17.922 --> 29:19.716
I'M HOLDING NO PUNCHES, BRO.

29:19.799 --> 29:21.593
- I'M READY TO DEFEND.
I'M READY TO FIGHT.

29:21.676 --> 29:23.636
- I'M NOT JUST DEFENDING
THIS TATTOO.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.597
I'M DEFENDING MY RIGHT
TO BE IN THE FINALE.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.515
- AND I'M GONNA FIGHT
FOR MY LIFE TO GET THAT SPOT.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.434
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BEAT ME,
DUDE.

29:29.517 --> 29:30.602
I'VE GOT WAY MORE ON THE LINE
THAN YOU DO.

29:30.685 --> 29:32.520
- I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.606
- I'VE BEEN FIGHTING HARD
FOR TWO SEASONS.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.608
- GOOD FOR YOU.
- WELL, JUST BRING IT, DUDE.

29:36.691 --> 29:37.650
- I'M GONNA BE DOWN THERE
FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE

29:37.734 --> 29:38.985
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

29:39.068 --> 29:40.278
- DUDE, YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.362
I WILL SHOW MY TEETH.

29:41.446 --> 29:41.654
- GO FOR IT.

29:50.413 --> 29:52.707
- THIS WEEK, YOU HAD TO PROVE
THAT YOU CAN HANDLE ANY TATTOO

29:52.957 --> 29:54.083
THAT IS THROWN YOUR WAY.

29:54.167 --> 29:57.045
JASON AND MARK,

29:57.128 --> 30:01.716
ONE OF YOU WILL NOT BE GOING
TO THE LIVE FINALE.

30:01.799 --> 30:03.635
MARK.

30:03.718 --> 30:05.678
- YOU'RE A BETTER ARTIST
ON PAPER.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.722
THAT ARTWORK NEEDS
TO COME THROUGH IN YOUR TATTOOS.

30:07.805 --> 30:09.724
IF YOU JUST MAKE
EVERYTHING MATCH,

30:09.807 --> 30:11.684
YOU SEW YOURSELF UP
A GUARANTEED VICTORY.

30:11.768 --> 30:12.644
- YOU WANT ME TO MATCH UP
EVERY WING

30:12.936 --> 30:14.729
LIKE ERIK DID ON HIS TATTOO?

30:14.812 --> 30:16.564
- I DO.
- THE WINGS ARE NOT THE SAME.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.566
I WAS TRYING TO EMULATE
AN ACTUAL FEATHER.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.652
- YOU DID A GRAPHIC TAKE
ON A WING...

30:20.735 --> 30:22.612
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
- WITH GRAPHIC FEATHERS,

30:22.695 --> 30:23.613
THEN MAKE ALL
THE GRAPHIC FEATHERS THE SAME

30:23.863 --> 30:24.781
SO THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.491
- JASON.

30:26.574 --> 30:29.202
- THIS TATTOO SHOWS
SOME TECHNICAL ABILITY,

30:29.285 --> 30:31.454
BUT I REALLY WISH YOU HAD MADE
A DECISION TO GIVE US

30:31.538 --> 30:32.997
A REAL WOW-FACTOR TATTOO.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.041
- I STILL STAND BY THE FACT THAT

30:35.124 --> 30:37.460
THIS IS A TATTOO THAT I KNOW
MARK COULD NEVER DO.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.420
- I JUST WON A REALISM CHALLENGE

30:39.504 --> 30:41.673
WITH A PORTRAIT
AGAINST YOUR TOP GUY RIGHT HERE.

30:41.756 --> 30:42.674
- YOU'RE STILL HAVING
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS

30:42.924 --> 30:44.592
IN YOUR TATTOOS, OBVIOUSLY.

30:44.842 --> 30:46.678
- BUT YOU'VE HAD
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS, TOO.

30:46.761 --> 30:47.720
- I HAVE, BUT YOU,
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,

30:47.971 --> 30:49.806
HAVE BEEN SKATING BY.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.724
- YOU CAN SIT AND TALK [bleep]
ALL YOU WANT.

30:51.975 --> 30:54.102
- HEY, I'M NOT TALKING [bleep].
IT'S MY TIME TO SPEAK.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.187
- LOOK, YOU CAN FIGHT AND TRY
TO TALK DOWN TO ME, BUT--

30:56.271 --> 30:57.981
- HERE'S THE THING:
IT'S NOT TALKING DOWN TO YOU.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.440
IT'S BAD.
- I'M ON YOUR SAME LEVEL.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.693
- MARK HAS BEEN IN THE BOTTOM

31:01.776 --> 31:03.528
MORE THAN ANYBODY I'VE EVER
KNOWN ON THIS WHOLE COMPETITION.

31:03.611 --> 31:04.487
- IF I COULD REACH OVER
AND STRANGLE HIM

31:04.571 --> 31:06.531
TO GET INTO THIS, I WOULD DO IT.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.700
- I'VE GOT THE HEART
OF A [bleep] TIGER, DUDE,

31:08.783 --> 31:10.660
AND I SWEAR TO GOD...
- SO DO I.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.745
- I WILL NEVER [bleep] LOSE.
- EVERYONE KNOWS

31:12.829 --> 31:14.622
WHAT KIND OF FIGHTER I AM.
- I WILL NEVER [bleep]--

31:14.706 --> 31:16.541
WELL, YOU COULD KNOCK ME
THE [bleep] OUT,

31:16.624 --> 31:18.418
I'LL GET BACK UP
A THOUSAND [bleep] TIMES,

31:18.501 --> 31:20.128
AND I'LL DO IT
EVERY [bleep] TIME TILL I WIN.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.546
- YOU'LL BE SNORING
ON THE GROUND.

31:21.629 --> 31:23.339
I'LL [bleep] CHOKE YOUR ASS.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.216
- AND I'LL DO IT
EVERY [bleep] TIME--

31:25.300 --> 31:26.676
- HEY, GUYS, GUYS, DON'T.
- GUYS, GUYS.

31:26.759 --> 31:27.760
- BECAUSE I'M A [bleep] WINNER.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.554
- JUST STOP.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.597
YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO
DOWN THAT ROAD.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.557
- [sighs]

31:32.640 --> 31:33.516
- OBVIOUSLY, EVERY DECISION
IS HARD TO MAKE,

31:33.600 --> 31:35.643
BUT WHEN IT GETS THIS CLOSE IN,

31:35.727 --> 31:37.645
AND IT'S GO HOME
OR GO TO THE FINALE,

31:37.729 --> 31:39.689
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE WEIGHT
ON OUR SHOULDERS.

31:39.939 --> 31:41.274
- AND YOU GUYS JUST LEFT IT
REALLY HARD TO JUSTIFIABLY SAY,

31:41.357 --> 31:42.483
"YOU'RE GOING, YOU'RE NOT."

31:42.567 --> 31:44.360
- JASON AND MARK,

31:44.444 --> 31:45.653
ONE OF YOU IS HEADED
TO THE LIVE FINALE,

31:45.737 --> 31:46.696
AND ONE OF YOU IS GOING

31:46.946 --> 31:47.155
TO HAVE TO CLOSE SHOP RIGHT NOW.

31:54.412 --> 31:57.165
- JASON AND MARK,

31:57.248 --> 31:59.375
ONE OF YOU
IS HEADED TO THE LIVE FINALE,

31:59.459 --> 32:00.668
AND ONE OF YOU IS GOING

32:00.752 --> 32:02.337
TO HAVE TO CLOSE SHOP RIGHT NOW.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.382
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

32:11.054 --> 32:15.183
JASON...

32:15.266 --> 32:19.937
YOU ARE HEADED
TO THE LIVE FINALE.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.565
MARK, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES

32:22.649 --> 32:24.692
TO BE INK MASTER.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.861
- YOU CAME OUT SWINGING
WITH EVERY TATTOO, MAN.

32:26.944 --> 32:28.446
I KNOW YOU'RE A GREAT TATTOOER,

32:28.529 --> 32:29.822
AND I KNOW YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO.

32:29.906 --> 32:32.158
I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF HEART.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.202
- I'LL KEEP MY HEAD UP HIGH.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.662
I FEEL LIKE I TOOK
A WORSE BEATING OF ANYONE HERE,

32:35.745 --> 32:37.705
BUT IT'S ALL FOR THE GOOD.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.123
YOU DON'T GET ANYWHERE FROM
PEOPLE PATTING YOU ON THE BACK.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.667
- YOU MADE IT TO NUMBER FOUR.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.585
YOU SHOWED A LOT OF FIGHT.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.879
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

32:51.386 --> 32:52.720
JASON,

32:52.804 --> 32:54.806
YOU ARE GOING TO THE FINALE

32:54.889 --> 32:57.725
WITH CLEEN AND ERIK.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.811
- I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
I'VE COME THIS FAR IN MY LIFE.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.604
I FEEL LIKE A CHAMPION, MAN.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.356
- CONGRATULATIONS.
SAVOR THIS MOMENT.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.149
YOU'VE EARNED IT
OVER TWO SEASONS.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.234
THE COMEBACK KID
GETS TO THE FINALE.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.152
- THANK YOU.

33:08.236 --> 33:09.445
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT
AND PREPARE TO MEET

33:09.529 --> 33:10.113
YOUR MASTER CANVASES.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.287
{\an8}- NO ONE IN THE HISTORY
OF <i> INK MASTER</i>

33:18.371 --> 33:20.748
{\an8}HAS EVER FOUGHT AS HARD AS ME.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.750
I GAVE IT EVERYTHING I GOT.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.545
I DESERVE TO BE IN THE FINALE,
FOR SURE.

33:25.628 --> 33:26.879
IT'S PRETTY HEART-WRENCHING
TO GET SO CLOSE

33:27.130 --> 33:28.214
AND JUST LOSE RIGHT HERE.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.512
- WHOO!
- YEAH.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.222
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.390
- HEY.
- I FINALLY [bleep] MADE IT.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.808
- GOOD JOB, MAN.

33:38.891 --> 33:39.851
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, BROTHER.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.477
- I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, MAN.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.438
I AM PUMPED, AND I AM LIKE...

33:43.521 --> 33:45.314
I'M ON FIRE.

33:45.398 --> 33:46.899
- MAN, THAT WAS
AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT, DUDE.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.151
I FELT LIKE I WAS GONNA DROP.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.944
- YOU LOOKED LIKE IT.

33:50.027 --> 33:51.028
- I JUST FINALLY BREATHED
RIGHT NOW.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.864
I JUST, LIKE--

33:53.156 --> 33:54.991
I FINALLY FEEL LIKE
A WEIGHT'S BEEN LIFTED OFF ME.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.868
- IT'S NOT OVER YET.
- I'M READY FOR THIS.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.494
I'M READY TO CELEBRATE.
- I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED

33:58.578 --> 34:00.455
TO DO A TATTOO IN MY CAREER.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.789
I KNOW I'M BRINGING IT.
I'M BRINGING IT HARD.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.708
- I AGREE.
- ME TOO.

34:03.791 --> 34:04.208
- I'M ON BOARD FOR THAT.
BALLS TO THE WALL, MAN.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.306
- CONGRATULATIONS.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.931
THE THREE OF YOU
HAVE EARNED YOUR SPOT

34:20.016 --> 34:21.809
IN THE LIVE FINALE.

34:21.893 --> 34:26.898
SO FAR, THE RIVALRY BETWEEN YOU
HAS BEEN INTENSE,

34:26.981 --> 34:29.609
AND IT'S ONLY JUST BEGINNING.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.779
ONLY ONE OF YOU WILL WALK AWAY
WITH $100,000,

34:33.070 --> 34:34.947
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

34:35.031 --> 34:37.283
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

34:37.366 --> 34:38.784
- YES.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.703
- FOR YOUR FINAL TATTOO,

34:40.786 --> 34:43.915
YOU WILL EACH BE ASSIGNED
A MASTER CANVAS.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.917
YOU WILL HAVE
A TOTAL OF 35 HOURS

34:46.208 --> 34:47.918
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS

34:48.002 --> 34:51.922
WITH YOUR MASTER CANVAS
TO CREATE

34:52.005 --> 34:54.717
A BACK PIECE.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.677
- IT'S ABOUT TO GET HOT.

34:56.761 --> 34:57.970
I'M SUPER PUMPED
ABOUT DOING THIS BACK PIECE.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.472
{\an8}I'M GONNA BUST OUT
EVERY TRICK I GOT.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.476
- HOWEVER...

35:03.559 --> 35:07.522
THERE IS A TWIST.

35:07.605 --> 35:11.692
THE STYLE OF YOUR BACK PIECE

35:11.776 --> 35:13.277
IS NOT UP TO YOU.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.034
IT'S UP TO YOUR RIVALS.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.953
- I AM SO PISSED RIGHT NOW.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.539
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAD PLANS FOR THIS BACK PIECE.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.332
- CLEEN AND ERIK,

35:26.415 --> 35:28.042
YOU WILL CHOOSE
THE STYLE FOR JASON.

35:28.125 --> 35:30.253
- OH, COME ON.

35:30.336 --> 35:31.754
- OH, BOY.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.840
- JASON AND ERIK,

35:33.923 --> 35:36.134
YOU WILL CHOOSE
THE STYLE FOR CLEEN.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.593
- WOW.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.679
- AND FINALLY, CLEEN AND JASON,

35:39.762 --> 35:41.347
YOU WILL CHOOSE
THE STYLE FOR ERIK.

35:44.809 --> 35:45.893
- I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE
JASON AND CLEEN

35:45.977 --> 35:47.186
ARE GONNA TRY TO SCREW ME.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.980
{\an8}BRING IT ON.

35:49.063 --> 35:50.940
- YOU WILL HAVE TEN MINUTES

35:51.023 --> 35:52.984
TO MEET IN PAIRS
TO CHOOSE A STYLE.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.778
THIS COULD BE
THE MOST CRITICAL CHOICE

35:55.862 --> 35:57.697
YOU MAKE IN THIS COMPETITION.

35:57.780 --> 36:00.116
IT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WALKING AWAY

36:00.199 --> 36:02.577
WITH $100,000

36:02.660 --> 36:05.037
OR WALKING AWAY

36:05.121 --> 36:07.456
WITH NOTHING.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.001
CLEEN AND ERIK,
YOU'RE UP FIRST.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.043
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
- LET'S GO.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.045
[chuckles]

36:13.296 --> 36:14.922
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

36:15.172 --> 36:16.883
- I DON'T KNOW.
WE GOT, WHAT, TRADITIONAL,

36:16.966 --> 36:17.967
NEW SCHOOL--
- JAPANESE.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.469
- JAPANESE.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.555
- ONLY THINGS THAT I THINK HE
REALLY HAD A PROBLEM WITH WAS,

36:22.638 --> 36:24.515
LIKE, THE TRADITIONAL,
WHEN HE DID THE CLIPPER SHIP.

36:24.599 --> 36:25.933
- AND I DON'T THINK
HIS LINE WORK CAN HANDLE

36:26.017 --> 36:27.977
A TRADITIONAL TATTOO AT ALL.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.937
- IF HE'S GIVEN NEW SCHOOL,
HE'S GOT TO DRAW SOMETHING.

36:30.187 --> 36:31.230
- IF WE GIVE HIM NEW SCHOOL,
HE'S GONNA [bleep] TEN BRICKS.

36:31.314 --> 36:31.522
- AND SWITCH.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.944
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, MAN?

36:37.194 --> 36:39.071
CLEEN'S BEEN
THE MOST CONSISTENT HERE.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.865
WHAT'S GONNA THROW HIM
FOR A LOOP?

36:40.948 --> 36:41.824
- JASON AND I
ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.076
CLEEN'S OUR BIGGEST COMPETITION,

36:44.327 --> 36:45.786
SO WE CAN'T GIVE HIM A SUBJECT
THAT HE'S GONNA EXCEL AT.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.955
WE REALLY HAVE TO SCREW HIM.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.999
- YOU GOT JAPANESE.

36:50.082 --> 36:51.000
YOU KNOW,
HE COULD HANG HIMSELF WITH THAT

36:51.250 --> 36:52.960
JUST ON DESIGN ELEMENTS ALONE.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.128
- AFTER LOOKING
AT HIS PORTFOLIO,

36:54.378 --> 36:55.713
I THINK HE WOULD EAT IT HARD

36:55.796 --> 36:56.964
ON COLOR REALISM, HONESTLY.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.175
- AND SWITCH.

37:01.677 --> 37:02.929
- WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, MAN?

37:03.221 --> 37:05.181
- AMERICAN TRADITIONAL IS EASY.

37:05.264 --> 37:07.099
- JAPANESE, OF COURSE,
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.060
- HE DOES NICE LINE WORK.

37:09.143 --> 37:11.103
- I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH COLOR REALISM.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.939
- THE PORTRAIT HE DID
WAS PRETTY HOKEY.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.857
- I WOULD SAY EITHER THAT
OR NEW SCHOOL.

37:14.941 --> 37:15.566
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.
- THAT'S IT. TIME'S UP.

37:20.821 --> 37:22.490
- CLEEN AND ERIK,

37:22.573 --> 37:24.700
WHAT STYLE DO YOU CHOOSE
FOR JASON?

37:24.784 --> 37:26.118
both: NEW SCHOOL.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.119
- [chuckles]

37:27.370 --> 37:29.205
- NEW SCHOOL IT IS.

37:29.288 --> 37:30.957
- ERIK AND CLEEN THINK
I'M A ONE-TRICK PONY.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.377
20-SOMETHING YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
BRINGS TALENT.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.586
BETTER WATCH OUT.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.338
- JASON AND ERIK,

37:37.421 --> 37:40.424
WHAT STYLE DO YOU CHOOSE
FOR CLEEN?

37:40.508 --> 37:41.968
- COLOR REALISM.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.594
- NO BIG DEAL.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.346
I'M GONNA STEP UP TO THE PLATE,

37:45.429 --> 37:46.555
AND I'M GONNA KILL
THIS BACK PIECE.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.307
- CLEEN AND JASON,

37:48.391 --> 37:50.393
WHAT STYLE DO YOU CHOOSE
FOR ERIK?

37:50.476 --> 37:52.561
- COLOR REALISM.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.855
- CLEEN AND ERIK
WILL BE GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD

37:54.939 --> 37:57.108
IN TERMS OF STYLE:
COLOR REALISM.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.527
- ME AND CLEEN HAVE BEEN NECK
AND NECK THIS WHOLE COMPETITION.

37:59.610 --> 38:02.530
NOW'S THE TIME TO TAKE HIM DOWN.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.073

YOUR MASTER CANVASES.

38:10.705 --> 38:13.499
ERIK, MEET KAYLA.
- HOW YOU DOING?

38:13.582 --> 38:15.751

YOUR MASTER CANVAS IS MICHAEL.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.169

38:17.420 --> 38:21.590

38:25.136 --> 38:26.721
IS COMPLETELY UP TO YOU,

38:26.804 --> 38:29.140
BUT YOU MUST TATTOO IN THE STYLE

38:29.223 --> 38:30.599
YOU'VE BEEN ASSIGNED.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.351
THIS TATTOO STANDS BETWEEN YOU

38:32.435 --> 38:35.187
AND $100,000.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.983
