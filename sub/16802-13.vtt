00:03.336 --> 00:05.630
Georgie: Previously on
"Heartland":

00:05.672 --> 00:08.258
(Phone messages ding)

00:08.299 --> 00:09.801
**

00:09.843 --> 00:11.386
(Phone message dings)

00:11.428 --> 00:14.097
- And we will be okay.
- I know.

00:14.139 --> 00:19.602
**

00:19.644 --> 00:21.438
- You still look a little down
though, Amy.

00:21.479 --> 00:24.607
- Yeah. I'm feeling better
about things. I just...

00:24.649 --> 00:26.443
It's really tough
without you here.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.570
- I get it.

00:28.611 --> 00:30.739
I wanna be home with you.

00:32.656 --> 00:39.664
**

00:39.706 --> 00:40.749
(Shuttle bus rumbles)

00:43.501 --> 00:44.836
Amy: So, Lisa is definitely
planning me

00:44.878 --> 00:46.921
a surprise baby shower.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.757
- What makes you say that?

00:48.798 --> 00:51.051
- Well, I don't know.
Everybody's acting so weird

00:51.092 --> 00:53.470
and she keeps asking me
what I'm doing on Sunday.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.597
Something's definitely
going on.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.515
Uh, do you know anything?

00:57.557 --> 00:59.184
- My lips are sealed.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.311
- (Sighs) Lou!

01:01.353 --> 01:02.854
And what is with all
the texting?

01:02.896 --> 01:04.313
You haven't put that thing down
since you got back.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.566
- I'm sorry. It's just work.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.069
- Right. And that's why
you're smiling?

01:10.570 --> 01:13.615
Lou, my husband
is 5000 miles away,

01:13.656 --> 01:15.867
I need to live vicariously
through you.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.036
- Okay. Fine.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.455
Mitch and I might
have started texting

01:20.497 --> 01:21.498
while I was in New York.

01:21.539 --> 01:24.125
- You what?
- And talking and e-mailing.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.296
- And why is this the first
time I'm hearing about it?

01:28.338 --> 01:30.548
- I didn't want to jinx it.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.716
I don't know, Amy,

01:31.758 --> 01:33.802
I think this could actually
be it.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.512
Like we might start dating

01:35.553 --> 01:37.806
and see where it goes.
(Giggles happily)

01:37.847 --> 01:39.891
- Aww... I'm happy for you.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.017
- Mmm.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.352
What's wrong with this tea?

01:42.394 --> 01:45.313
- (Laughs) Don't get me started
on life without caffeine.

01:45.355 --> 01:48.024
(Both chuckle)

01:48.066 --> 01:49.776
(Shuttle bus rumbles)

01:51.361 --> 02:00.537
**

02:00.578 --> 02:02.163
(Heels clack lightly)

02:06.042 --> 02:08.294
- Important text?

02:08.336 --> 02:09.420
- No, not really.

02:09.461 --> 02:10.672
(Keypad clicks)

02:10.714 --> 02:12.549
You can have the last fry
if you want.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.427
- I'm good.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.722
- You okay? You seem kind of...
quiet.

02:18.763 --> 02:19.889
- I'm fine.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.600
Unless there's something
you wanna talk about.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.310
Something you need
to tell me?

02:24.352 --> 02:26.855
- Like what?

02:26.896 --> 02:29.691
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

02:29.733 --> 02:30.859
Adam?

02:35.196 --> 02:38.366
(Sighs) I hope he's not coming
over here.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.701
- Don't you wanna say hi?

02:39.743 --> 02:42.579
- No, I am not in the mood
to deal with Clay right now.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.872
(Sighs)

02:45.498 --> 02:48.001
(Dishes clank,
diners chat quietly)

02:48.043 --> 02:50.462
Lisa: All right, little lady,
would you prefer

02:50.503 --> 02:53.840
chicken noodle or minestrone
homemade soup?

02:53.882 --> 02:55.508
- Chicken noodle.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.718
- I knew you were gonna
say that.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.094
- What about me?

02:58.136 --> 02:59.804
- You'll eat anything.
(Jack chuckles)

02:59.846 --> 03:02.891
Hey! Are we expecting someone?

03:02.932 --> 03:05.894
- Don't ask me.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.813
I'm always the last
to know anything.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.899
- Well, there's a cab.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.233
(Cab rumbles)

03:14.611 --> 03:15.737
(Remy barks)

03:15.779 --> 03:17.280
Go see who it is.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.115
(Remy barks)

03:19.157 --> 03:22.494
(Screen door snicks open
and snaps shut)

03:22.535 --> 03:34.673
**

03:34.714 --> 03:35.924
- Mallory?

03:37.425 --> 03:39.344
- Hey, Jack.

03:41.888 --> 03:51.856
**

03:51.856 --> 03:57.320
**

03:57.362 --> 04:01.783
* And at the break of day
you sank into your dream *

04:04.452 --> 04:05.745
* You dreamer *

04:05.787 --> 04:08.498
* Oh, oh, oh, oh... *

04:08.540 --> 04:10.625
* You dreamer... *

04:12.711 --> 04:16.464
* You dreamer... *

04:22.012 --> 04:24.556
- My gosh, look at you!

04:24.597 --> 04:26.975
This is so unexpected!

04:27.017 --> 04:28.727
(Cab rumbles away)

04:28.768 --> 04:30.562
- You know me,
I like to make an entrance.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.022
(Jack chuckles)

04:32.063 --> 04:34.649
- Mallory?!

04:34.691 --> 04:36.818
- I'm back!
- It is so good to see you!

04:36.860 --> 04:38.069
What're you doing here?

04:38.111 --> 04:40.739
- Look at you!
You're all grown up.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.116
I hardly recognize you.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.909
Come on, let's get you
in the house.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.828
Mallory: It's good to see you.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.455
Amy: So, you're still living
in London?

04:48.496 --> 04:49.873
I mean, tell us about it!

04:49.914 --> 04:51.583
- What's to tell?
It's the best decision

04:51.624 --> 04:52.500
I've ever made in my life.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.544
- London's an amazing city,
isn't it?

04:54.586 --> 04:56.713
- Yeah. You should see my flat
in Brick Lane.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.215
I have a job at this posh
clothing store.

04:59.257 --> 05:02.052
Can you say "employee
discounts"?

05:02.093 --> 05:05.638
And it's perfect because
I can go to work in the day

05:05.680 --> 05:07.307
and take classes at night.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.642
- Wow. Sounds like you have it
all figured out.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.102
- Do you ever see Soraya?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.146
- We text but she's pretty busy.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.982
- How 'bout Jake? You see much
of him over there?

05:16.024 --> 05:19.069
- You can say our on-again
off-again relationship

05:19.110 --> 05:21.029
is currently 'off'.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.239
Speaking of relationships,
I've missed so much.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.909
You're married,
you're married...

05:25.950 --> 05:27.202
(Lisa giggles)

05:27.243 --> 05:29.079
and you are all grown up.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.206
Do you remember
your Auntie Mallory?

05:31.247 --> 05:34.125
- Come on, sweetie,
you remember Mallory, right?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.960
- How can she not remember me?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.962
I was just her primary caregiver

05:38.004 --> 05:39.589
for her formative years.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.841
- Well, I wouldn't go that far,
I mean...

05:41.883 --> 05:43.885
- That was a long time back.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.929
- How's Ty?

05:45.970 --> 05:47.806
Where is Ty?

05:47.847 --> 05:49.766
- Mongolia, actually.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.560
- I'm sorry. I thought you said
Mongolia.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.104
- I know it sounds crazy,

05:54.145 --> 05:55.939
but he's working with
Veterinarians Without Borders.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.649
He's just loving it.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.484
- But you're...
- Pregnant.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.819
- I was gonna say huge.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.696
- Oh! Well, don't worry.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.782
He will be back
before the baby's born.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.117
- I was sorry to hear
about you and Peter.

06:07.158 --> 06:10.036
- Oh, it's okay. You know,
not every relationship

06:10.078 --> 06:11.621
is meant to go the distance.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.081
- Tell me about it.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.378
So... what room am I gonna
stay in?

06:21.006 --> 06:23.008
What?
- Well, we just thought--

06:23.049 --> 06:24.968
- That you'd probably wanna
stay with your parents?

06:25.010 --> 06:26.177
Aren't they dying to see you?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.138
- No, they're on tour.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.557
What am I gonna do?
Stay in an empty house?

06:30.598 --> 06:32.058
- No, you're not.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.894
You're gonna stay in Amy's
old room, right?

06:34.936 --> 06:36.021
- Yeah, of course.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.189
Lisa: Yeah.
- Great.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.067
Jack, can you do me a favor?
Can you swing me by my parents?

06:41.109 --> 06:43.611
I want to pick up my car -
if it's still there.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.739
- Sure.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.532
- (Chuckles)

06:51.202 --> 06:57.083
**

06:57.125 --> 06:59.044
(Bag thumps)

07:00.712 --> 07:03.631
(Sentimental music)

07:03.673 --> 07:18.521
**

07:18.563 --> 07:22.817
**

07:22.859 --> 07:24.736
(Startling knock)

07:24.778 --> 07:26.738
- All settled?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.406
- Yeah.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.700
Yeah, I'm a world traveler now,
Jack.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.202
Doesn't take much
to make me happy.

07:32.243 --> 07:35.121
- (Chuckles) Yeah, I guess.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.790
Uh, just curious...

07:39.042 --> 07:40.835
but why the sudden visit?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.712
You could've told us
you were coming.

07:42.754 --> 07:46.424
- Well, Lisa didn't give me
much of a heads up.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.760
For the baby shower -
that's why I'm here.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.261
- Right.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.056
- I mean, I only got her e-mail
a week ago.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.101
But Amy and Ty
are having a baby;

07:56.142 --> 07:57.977
I wouldn't miss it, you know?

07:58.019 --> 08:00.271
- Well, you're always
a welcome guest.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.024
Always... like any time.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.153
Okay.
- (Chuckles softly)

08:07.195 --> 08:09.322
(Receding footsteps)

08:09.364 --> 08:11.116
(Cell phone rings)

08:12.367 --> 08:14.202
(Cell phone rings)

08:14.244 --> 08:16.913
(Snorts,
phone ring cuts out)

08:16.955 --> 08:18.832
(Phone thumps on bed)

08:23.878 --> 08:26.214
(Birds chirp outside,
approaching footsteps)

08:28.550 --> 08:30.385
- Well, that was certainly
a surprise, wasn't it?

08:30.427 --> 08:32.429
Did you know she was coming?

08:32.470 --> 08:34.389
- No, she said she's here
for Amy's shower.

08:34.431 --> 08:35.849
- Well, I sent her the invite,

08:35.890 --> 08:37.100
but it was kind of a courtesy
e-mail.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.351
I didn't think
she'd actually come.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.770
- Oh, well, who knows why
Mallory does what she does,

08:41.813 --> 08:44.441
I'm just glad she's here.
- Yeah, me too.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.192
Mallory: Lou, wait up!

08:46.234 --> 08:48.153
- Oh, hey!

08:48.194 --> 08:50.155
- Sorry for drudging up
the past back there.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.365
I hope it didn't bother you.
- Mallory, it's fine.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.825
You know, Peter and I are
actually in

08:53.867 --> 08:55.201
a really good place now.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.286
- Yeah, but I know it's
a bummer

08:56.327 --> 08:58.329
when the future you thought
you were gonna have

08:58.371 --> 09:00.206
doesn't work out.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.375
- Hey, is everything okay
with you?

09:02.417 --> 09:03.293
- I'm good.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.503
I'm better than good.
I'm home.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.464
- Well, we're all really glad
you're back.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.175
And Georgie is gonna be so
happy to see you, oh my gosh.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.468
Did you know she works
at Maggie's now?

09:11.509 --> 09:12.469
- (Chuckles)
- Yeah, I know.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.471
And get this,
she even has a boyfriend.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.513
(Footsteps thud)
- Whoa.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.307
- I know. She's really changed

09:17.349 --> 09:19.142
since the last time
you saw her.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.102
- No, not whoa Georgie,
whoa, who is that?

09:21.144 --> 09:22.437
- Who? Him?
(Tools clank)

09:22.479 --> 09:24.898
It's no one,
it's just the ranch hand.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.358
Why don't I give you a ride
to your car?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.650
- Jack said he would drive me.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.612
- Yeah, let's just save him
the trip. Come on, let's go.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.157
(Tools clatter)

09:34.199 --> 09:36.785
(Country music plays quietly,
door clicks open)

09:36.826 --> 09:39.412
- Maggie's!
(Door bangs shut)

09:39.454 --> 09:40.497
- Mallory?

09:40.538 --> 09:42.749
- Georgie?
- (Laughs)

09:42.791 --> 09:45.502
- Oh... Whoa!
I hardly recognized you

09:45.543 --> 09:47.837
without the hoodie
and baggy jeans.

09:47.879 --> 09:48.838
- (Chuckles)

09:48.880 --> 09:51.383
Um, Adam, this is Mallory.
Mallory. Adam.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.134
- Hey!
- Nice to meet you.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.302
- You too!

09:54.344 --> 09:56.805
(Dishes clatter)

09:56.846 --> 09:57.889
(Dull thud, horse snorts)

09:57.931 --> 09:59.307
(Tools clatter)

10:00.809 --> 10:02.268
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.229
I was hoping you'd still
be here.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.064
- I'm just headed out
to the Dude Ranch, actually,

10:06.106 --> 10:08.274
but why don't we, uh...

10:08.316 --> 10:10.068
why don't we have dinner
while you're home?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.737
- Yeah, I'd like that.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.072
- Great.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.033
- I um...

10:17.075 --> 10:19.327
I really enjoyed
our conversations

10:19.369 --> 10:20.495
while I was in New York.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.914
- Yeah, me too. You know, I...

10:22.956 --> 10:24.207
I don't think I've been on
the phone that much

10:24.249 --> 10:25.917
since high school.
- (Laugh) Yeah.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.921
This whole thing, it makes me
feel like I'm 16 again.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.048
You know, I get this
crazy feeling

10:32.090 --> 10:34.676
in the pit of my stomach
every time my phone pings.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.888
I like it.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.016
Makes me excited, you know,
for...

10:42.934 --> 10:44.936
moving forward.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.230
The "future."

10:47.272 --> 10:49.024
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.611
Uh... I should, I should
get back to work.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.947
Jack's just, he's got me
on this strict schedule.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.158
- Great.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.118
- I'll see you.
- Okay.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.872
(Receding footsteps)

11:05.081 --> 11:06.624
- (Sighs)

11:06.666 --> 11:08.752
- I can't believe how much
I miss this place.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.297
I have been craving a Maggie's
chicken club since I've landed.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.924
- Yeah, it's uh... not on
the menu anymore.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.259
- What?

11:16.301 --> 11:17.594
- Yeah. Lou's been changing
a few things

11:17.635 --> 11:20.805
since she's decided to open up
a new location in Brooklyn.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.682
A Maggie's in Brooklyn?

11:23.600 --> 11:27.228
Is nothing sacred?
(Door opens)

11:27.270 --> 11:28.480
(Door bangs shut)

11:28.521 --> 11:30.315
Clay: Hey, guys.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.025
Georgie, can we talk
for a second?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.943
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.904
(Low hum of chatter)

11:40.116 --> 11:42.327
- Is that Georgie's S.O.?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.287
- Uh...?

11:44.329 --> 11:47.957
- Significant other.
Lou said she's seeing someone.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.752
- I'm her significant other.
That's Clay.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.838
He and Georgie are just friends.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.590
- Right.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.468
(Low hum of chatter,
music plays quietly)

11:58.510 --> 12:01.262
In my experience, nobody is
"just friends" with a cowboy.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.100
(Low hum of chatter,
music plays softly)

12:05.141 --> 12:06.476
Lisa: Are you heading out?

12:06.518 --> 12:09.562
- Yeah, coffee with Stumpy.
He's been bugging me for weeks.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.523
- You have time to pick up
Amy's gift

12:11.564 --> 12:13.817
at the Post Office, yes?
- Absolutely.

12:13.858 --> 12:18.947
- Okay, you need this receipt -
here it is - to pick it up.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.156
No, don't!

12:20.198 --> 12:22.242
I know it's expensive,
but I did all my research.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.535
It is lightweight,
it is durable,

12:23.576 --> 12:25.161
it's good in every weather,
on every road.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.496
It's perfect for them.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.123
You're gonna love it.
- Mm-hmm.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.542
- Get it.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.043
(Door opens and closes)

12:32.085 --> 12:34.796
- Why didn't you introduce me
to Mallory as your boyfriend?

12:34.838 --> 12:37.257
- Oh, I don't know.
I thought it was implied.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.384
- Well, it wasn't and now
she thinks you're with Clay.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.593
- (With disgust) Oh...

12:40.635 --> 12:42.929
Well, sorry, I didn't know
it was such a big deal.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.223
- It is a big deal. To me.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.683
- Okay, well, I thought
we were done

12:46.725 --> 12:47.892
with the whole "Clay thing,"

12:47.934 --> 12:50.145
whatever the "Clay thing" was
in the first place.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.940
(Car rumbles) Oh.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.233
(Horn beeps)

12:55.275 --> 12:57.986
I gotta go. Mallory's here.
She's taking me home.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.779
Do you wanna come?

12:59.821 --> 13:02.365
- No, I think there's something
I gotta take care of.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.284
- Okay.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.161
(Running footsteps)

13:09.456 --> 13:12.250
(Birds chirp, car rumbles away)

13:13.460 --> 13:14.836
(Footsteps thud)

13:16.046 --> 13:17.672
- It's official.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.549
I've ruined things with Mitch.

13:19.591 --> 13:22.260
- Since this morning?
- Yeah! Of course.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.013
You knew me, classic case
of foot in mouth syndrome.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.307
- Oh no. Lou, what did you say?

13:27.349 --> 13:29.309
- It was just so nice
to see him, Amy,

13:29.351 --> 13:31.394
and I was feeling
so comfortable,

13:31.436 --> 13:33.271
and I let it slip...

13:33.313 --> 13:35.940
- What? What did you let slip?

13:35.982 --> 13:38.109
- The "f" word.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.320
- Huh?
- The future.

13:40.362 --> 13:44.115
I told him I was excited
about our future together.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.534
- Okay... but I don't really see
what's wrong with that.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.204
- Amy, nothing kills a new
relationship faster

13:49.245 --> 13:51.706
than talking about the future.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.249
I scared him off.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.377
You should've seen the look
on his face.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.921
- Lou, it's probably not as bad
as you think it is.

13:57.962 --> 14:02.133
Why don't you just talk to him,
find out what's going on.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.219
- (Sighs) You know what?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.680
You're right.
I am a grown woman

14:06.721 --> 14:10.141
and... and no more beating
around the bush.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.142
He talked about going
for dinner.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.687
I'm gonna make sure
that happens tonight.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.064
(Footsteps thunk)

14:19.651 --> 14:21.444
- Thanks again for the ride.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.320
I'm learning to drive you know.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.155
Maybe once you go back
to England,

14:24.197 --> 14:26.241
I can save up and buy your car.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.575
- Who says I'm going back?

14:27.617 --> 14:29.077
(Cell phone rings)

14:30.620 --> 14:32.247
(Cell phone rings)

14:33.456 --> 14:35.417
(Birds chirp)

14:35.458 --> 14:37.252
- Everything okay?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.670
- Of course.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.338
Come on, I want you
to introduce me

14:40.380 --> 14:42.257
to the new ranch hand.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.302
(Music plays in diner,
door snicks open)

14:46.344 --> 14:49.097
(Dishes clank, diners chatter)

14:49.139 --> 14:51.266
- We need to talk.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.809
- Sorry, man.
I was just leaving.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.019
- It's about Georgie.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.564
- You got a great girl there.
She's one of a kind.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.190
(Hard thump, items clatter)

14:59.232 --> 15:00.650
Diners: Hey, whoa! Hey!

15:00.692 --> 15:02.193
- What the hell is the matter
with you?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.695
You got a death wish
or something?

15:03.737 --> 15:04.571
- Just stay away
from my girlfriend!

15:04.612 --> 15:06.406
- What the hell are you
talking about?

15:06.448 --> 15:08.241
- All right! That is enough!

15:08.283 --> 15:10.326
- I was just defending myself.
He came at me.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.370
(Door bursts open)
- Adam!

15:13.496 --> 15:14.914
(Door clicks shut)

15:14.956 --> 15:17.375
(Approaching footsteps)
- Hey, Georgie,

15:17.417 --> 15:18.835
do you know where Amy keeps
the nippers and rasp?

15:18.877 --> 15:20.628
I was thinking of doing
the trail horses' hooves.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.298
- Uh, no. No idea.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.133
- I don't think we've met.
I'm Mallory.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.510
- Uh, hey, Mitch Cutty.
I work here.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.179
- Nice to meet you.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.805
- All right. See you girls
later.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.391
(Phoenix grunts)

15:33.433 --> 15:35.643
- Mitch Cutty.
More like Mitch cutie.

15:35.685 --> 15:36.770
- (Chuckles)

15:36.811 --> 15:39.230
(Grunting)
- (Gasps) Copper!

15:40.398 --> 15:42.650
(Horses snort and grunt)

15:44.611 --> 15:47.072
I missed you. Did you miss me?

15:47.113 --> 15:48.490
(Copper grunts)
Hmm?

15:48.531 --> 15:49.824
- (Chuckles)

15:49.866 --> 15:52.077
So what's up with you and Adam?

15:52.118 --> 15:54.746
- Oh, nothing.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.623
- Well, it didn't seem like
nothing.

15:56.664 --> 16:00.168
- We were friends,
but now we're together.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.587
- Sounds familiar.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.506
- He's actually pretty amazing.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.510
- Georgie, do you still jump
much?

16:08.551 --> 16:09.886
- Um, no, not really.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.721
I'm kind of more into
trick riding now.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.432
We've got a new trainer and
the schedule's pretty hectic,

16:14.474 --> 16:17.560
so I don't have time
for much else.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.562
Why?

16:19.604 --> 16:21.356
- I have a favor to ask you.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.359
Can I jump Phoenix?

16:26.861 --> 16:29.572
Lisa: Adam tried to fight Clay?
Wait, Georgie's Adam?

16:29.614 --> 16:31.408
- I don't know what got
into that kid,

16:31.449 --> 16:33.243
but I'm telling you,
he is lucky

16:33.284 --> 16:34.911
Clay didn't fight back.

16:34.953 --> 16:37.372
- Well, are you gonna talk
to Georgie about that?

16:37.414 --> 16:39.582
- I think it's best
if I stay out of this one.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.627
Besides, we've got enough
to worry about.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.589
- Oh, what's that?
Mallory. Oh.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.341
- That fell out of her bag.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.676
- So she flew from Paris.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.302
But she says she's living
in London.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.430
- I know it's probably none
of my business,

16:53.471 --> 16:56.766
but there's definitely
more to this story.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.227
- All right.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.062
Oh... (Pages flutter)

17:01.104 --> 17:04.273
Looks like it needs a little
assembly required here.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.777
Um... Oh that looks complicated.
Huh.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.695
(Book thumps)
- (Amused sigh)

17:10.821 --> 17:14.784
**

17:14.826 --> 17:15.993
- Are you sure you wanna
do this?

17:16.036 --> 17:18.329
We could just try some flatwork
instead.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.332
- No way. Come on, Phoenix.
(Clucks tongue)

17:21.374 --> 17:23.292
- All right,
at least take it slow.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.420
- (Clicks tongue)
Come on, Phoenix.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.091
(Hooves thud)

17:32.302 --> 17:33.428
(Hooves thud)

17:37.349 --> 17:38.308
(Heavy landing)

17:38.350 --> 17:39.559
- Whoa-oh! (Groans)

17:39.601 --> 17:41.728
- Phoenix!

17:41.770 --> 17:43.521
(Hooves plod, tack jingles)

17:43.563 --> 17:45.190
- (Breathing hard)

17:45.231 --> 17:45.774
(Groans)

17:48.068 --> 17:49.694
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.780
(Clothes rustle)

17:51.821 --> 17:54.574
- Well, thanks for the hand.

17:54.616 --> 17:57.452
I-I gotta say, things have
sure changed

17:57.494 --> 17:59.746
since the last time
I put one of these together.

17:59.788 --> 18:00.955
- (Sighs)

18:00.997 --> 18:03.458
Well, I don't know
how much help I'm gonna be,

18:03.500 --> 18:06.086
but let's give 'er a try.

18:06.127 --> 18:10.131
- Well, let's start by
unfolding this thing here.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.929
Uh... it says...

18:15.970 --> 18:19.474
"Push the latch and the locking
mechanism will release."

18:19.516 --> 18:21.267
(Clicking)

18:21.309 --> 18:22.519
- Uh...
- No?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.562
(Hard tugs)

18:24.604 --> 18:26.481
No, that's not it, it's not it.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.567
No. Here, let me try that.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.444
- You know, uh, Jack,

18:31.486 --> 18:33.655
I wanted to talk to you about
something while I'm here.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.824
- Oh yeah?
Oh, right here.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.826
- (Amused chuckle)
- No, that's not it.

18:37.867 --> 18:41.705
- I'm not quite sure
how to say this...

18:41.746 --> 18:44.749
- Well, don't worry about
sparing my delicate feelings.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.294
What's going on?
- (Chuckles softly)

18:48.336 --> 18:50.338
I found a new job.

18:58.722 --> 18:59.639
(Hooves thud)

18:59.681 --> 19:00.932
Mallory: Come on, Phoenix.
Good boy!

19:00.974 --> 19:03.685
(Hooves thud, Phoenix grunts)

19:03.727 --> 19:05.687
(Phoenix grunts,
Mallory clicks her tongue)

19:05.729 --> 19:07.689
Let's go.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.649
(Hooves thud)

19:11.568 --> 19:14.320
(Rail thumps)

19:14.362 --> 19:15.530
(Distorted grunt)

19:16.823 --> 19:17.741
(Heavy thud)
- Oh!

19:17.782 --> 19:20.827
(Distorted hoofbeats,
distorted thud)

19:20.869 --> 19:21.786
(Hooves thud,
Phoenix breathes hard)

19:21.828 --> 19:23.496
- What's going on here?

19:23.538 --> 19:24.956
- Mallory wanted to try jumping
Phoenix again.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.584
I told her it was a bad idea.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.795
- I have to agree with Georgie,
it is a bad idea.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.339
The last time you tried
to jump a horse,

19:32.380 --> 19:33.798
you just about killed it.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.759
(Birds chirp)

19:35.800 --> 19:38.094
Sorry. I'm kidding.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.597
- I used to be good at this
or at least I had potential.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.599
Now I can't even get over
one jump.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.726
- Mallory, when was the last
time you were even on a horse?

19:44.768 --> 19:45.977
Three years ago?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.729
Why do you wanna do this anyway?

19:47.771 --> 19:49.647
- I don't need you
to lecture me, Amy.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.858
I need your expertise.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.361
I wanna be good at this again.
Will you help me or what?

19:55.528 --> 19:56.821
(Birds chirp)

19:56.863 --> 19:58.948
Lisa: Well, I'm sorry to hear
that.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.658
No, I will, I will.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.328
Okay. Okay. Bye.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.954
Oh. (Phone beeps off)

20:04.996 --> 20:06.456
Tim and Casey aren't gonna
make it to the shower.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.458
- Oh, that's too bad.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.919
- So? How did it go
with Amy's gift?

20:10.960 --> 20:13.963
- Well, let's just say that
the answer to question

20:14.005 --> 20:16.007
"how many grown men
does it take

20:16.049 --> 20:18.510
to put together a stroller"
is two.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.012
- (Chuckles)
- Just two! I'm so impressed.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.181
I'm very grateful, I really am,
and Amy will be too.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.016
Thank you.
- Well, I should get going.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.726
- You don't wanna stay
for dinner?

20:26.768 --> 20:27.936
- Thanks, but I-I already
have plans.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.896
- Okay. Next time.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.856
- Well, we're sure gonna
miss you around here.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.650
- Hey, thanks, Jack.
I just wanna say,

20:33.692 --> 20:35.568
I'm really appreciative
of everything

20:35.610 --> 20:37.904
you did for me this year.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.447
- Hey!
- Hi.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.244
(Screen door snaps shut)
- What was that about?

20:44.285 --> 20:47.664
- Well, it looks like I'll be
looking for a new ranch hand.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.833
Mitch just told me
he's moving on.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.626
- Oh no.

20:51.668 --> 20:57.966
**

20:58.008 --> 21:01.845
Mitch: So one of the reasons
I wanted to have dinner

21:01.886 --> 21:04.514
was I have been thinking
a lot about us...

21:04.556 --> 21:07.684
and the future,
and about the next steps.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.437
- Yeah, steps away
from Heartland.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.898
Grandpa told me, okay?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.984
I know you're leaving.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.652
- (Sighs)

21:17.694 --> 21:18.987
I wanted to tell you
the news myself.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.196
- So you are leaving.

21:20.238 --> 21:21.906
- I had a job interview
last week.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.534
It... it was for a Power
Engineering position

21:24.576 --> 21:27.787
in Calgary.
It's what I apprenticed in.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.873
The interview went well. I just
wanted to give Jack a heads up.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.751
- Well, I would've appreciated
the same courtesy.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.419
- Lou!

21:36.171 --> 21:37.839
(Receding footsteps)

21:39.257 --> 21:40.633
(Door opens,
Mitch sighs heavily)

21:42.635 --> 21:44.929
- Mm... Do you think it's
possible to get saddle sores

21:44.971 --> 21:46.639
after just one day of riding?

21:46.681 --> 21:48.516
- (Laughs) Maybe if you spent
any time

21:48.558 --> 21:49.809
in the actual saddle.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.311
- Nice.
Amy: (Laughs)

21:51.353 --> 21:52.896
Thanks, Mallory.
We can take it from here.

21:52.937 --> 21:54.230
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!

21:54.272 --> 21:56.733
You have done your fair share
of dishes over the years.

21:56.775 --> 21:59.736
We've got this.
- Thanks.

21:59.778 --> 22:03.031
Well, I'm gonna go see if Jack
has gotten any better at cards.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.617
- (Laughs)

22:05.658 --> 22:07.077
Hey, Georgie, I think
it's pretty cool

22:07.118 --> 22:09.829
that you let Mallory ride
Phoenix today.

22:09.871 --> 22:12.082
Couple years ago that probably
wouldn't have happened.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.209
Actually, I know it
wouldn't have.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.710
- Seemed like she needed it.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.463
- What do you mean?

22:18.505 --> 22:20.590
- (Sighs) Well, come on, Amy.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.008
I know I'm not the only one
who's wondering

22:22.050 --> 22:24.094
why Mallory's here.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.595
- Did she said something to you?

22:25.637 --> 22:28.139
- No, not really. I mean...

22:28.181 --> 22:30.809
there was one thing.
Jake called her.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.269
- Jake? Like Jake Jake?

22:33.311 --> 22:36.106
- Yeah. She just completely
ignored him.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.692
She just seemed kind of off.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.486
(Birds chirp)

22:42.987 --> 22:44.489
(Door opens)

22:46.533 --> 22:47.909
(Door closes)

22:49.536 --> 22:51.496
(Birds chirp)

22:55.709 --> 22:58.128
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.630
Look, I-I feel like I should
explain myself.

23:00.672 --> 23:02.716
- There's nothing to explain,
Mitch.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.009
- Lou--
- I--

23:04.050 --> 23:06.761
I know it's the kiss of death
to talk about the future

23:06.803 --> 23:09.723
when we've really just started
whatever this is.

23:09.764 --> 23:11.349
- No, Lou--

23:11.391 --> 23:12.684
- And really all we've done
is text.

23:12.726 --> 23:15.311
I mean, we can't even have a
proper conversation in person.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.856
We're better at just using
our fingers on a keypad.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.650
So... forget what I said
about being excited

23:20.692 --> 23:22.152
about the future, okay?

23:22.193 --> 23:24.654
I want it but you don't.
It's pretty simple.

23:24.696 --> 23:27.198
- Lou, (frustrated chuckle)

23:27.240 --> 23:30.076
(Chair thumps)

23:30.118 --> 23:32.996
nothing could be further
from the truth.

23:33.038 --> 23:36.791
I am just as excited
about us as you are.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.960
- You are?
- Yeah.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.880
All those feelings that you
talked about earlier...

23:41.921 --> 23:45.091
I have them too.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.469
- Then why are you leaving?

23:49.429 --> 23:52.640
- I'm not leaving Heartland
to avoid you.

23:54.059 --> 23:56.978
I'm leaving for you.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.772
Ever since you signed
the divorce papers,

23:58.813 --> 24:01.566
I feel like I have to step up
to the plate.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.152
I wanna be...

24:04.194 --> 24:06.988
(Sighs) I wanna be the kind
of guy that you deserve.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.824
(Birds chirp)

24:11.910 --> 24:15.497
**

24:18.917 --> 24:22.671
**

24:22.712 --> 24:24.756
- Take one,
put it in their nest--

24:24.798 --> 24:27.509
- Oh my God!
What happened up here?

24:27.550 --> 24:28.802
- (Laughs)

24:28.843 --> 24:30.929
Where are all the old
license plates

24:30.970 --> 24:32.472
and the rodeo pictures?

24:32.514 --> 24:34.099
- Grandpa and Dad did
an amazing job.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.267
Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah!

24:36.309 --> 24:37.519
When you said you were living
in the loft,

24:37.560 --> 24:41.022
I was picturing maybe something
with hay or some chickens.

24:41.064 --> 24:42.524
- (Laughs)
- Wow!

24:44.526 --> 24:47.696
And you set up the cradle
and everything.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.825
Katie, are you excited
to have a little cousin?

24:51.866 --> 24:54.869
- No.
- (Laughs) Okay.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.121
Are you ready to get started?

24:56.162 --> 24:58.081
- Born ready.

24:58.123 --> 25:00.875
(Door opens)

25:00.917 --> 25:02.127
(Door bangs shut)

25:02.168 --> 25:04.170
(Diners chatter quietly)

25:04.212 --> 25:06.214
(Dishes and utensils clank)

25:06.256 --> 25:08.550
(Music plays quietly)

25:11.386 --> 25:12.929
- Pretty sure I'm not supposed
to talk to you.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.806
- Says who?

25:14.848 --> 25:18.143
- Your big, tough boyfriend.
- Adam?

25:18.184 --> 25:20.937
- He basically attacked me
out of nowhere yesterday.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.773
- Adam did?
- Don't sound so surprised.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.316
That guy's got some fight
in him.

25:25.358 --> 25:28.445
Not enough, but... some.

25:28.486 --> 25:31.281
- Why would he do that?
- No clue.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.950
He seems to think I have
some sort of crush on you.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.244
I mean, come on. You're a kid.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.788
You're basically like
my little sister.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.081
I would never.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.708
- (Sighs)

25:42.876 --> 25:44.085
(Birds chirp)

25:45.503 --> 25:47.797
(Approaching footsteps,
Mitch sighs)

25:47.839 --> 25:49.174
- Hi.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.842
(Footsteps thump)

25:50.884 --> 25:52.177
- Hey.

25:52.218 --> 25:55.013
(Rooster crows in the distance)

25:55.055 --> 25:57.098
- Nothing is ever easy for us,
is it?

25:57.140 --> 25:59.642
- Oh... easy is overrated.

25:59.684 --> 26:01.436
- (Chuckles)

26:01.478 --> 26:05.065
Look, I was thinking about
what we talked about and...

26:05.106 --> 26:08.902
I don't want you to think
I don't respect what you do.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.904
- You know, it didn't feel
great having you call me

26:10.945 --> 26:12.197
"just the ranch hand"
the other day.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.157
- To Mallory? No, Mitch,

26:14.199 --> 26:17.160
that was just to keep her
from digging.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.162
You may have just met her,
but believe me when I tell you

26:19.204 --> 26:21.206
that gossip is her
second language.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.999
- Yeah, but...

26:23.041 --> 26:25.043
you know, your husband's
this big oil guy.

26:25.085 --> 26:27.921
I mean, how am I gonna...
stack up to that?

26:27.962 --> 26:30.465
- Don't compare yourself.

26:30.507 --> 26:33.468
And he was never around.

26:33.510 --> 26:36.096
You're here.

26:36.137 --> 26:39.974
I... I like having you here.

26:41.226 --> 26:45.063
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:45.105 --> 26:48.858
It might sound silly
but it gives me peace of mind.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.069
And I like looking forward
to seeing you

26:51.111 --> 26:53.863
when I come home from New York.

26:53.905 --> 26:56.116
- Well, me too. But...

26:56.157 --> 26:58.034
Lou, I mean, this-
this can't last forever.

26:58.076 --> 27:00.120
This job was just supposed
to be a stopgap

27:00.161 --> 27:01.955
until I figure out what I want
to do with the rest of my life.

27:01.996 --> 27:05.667
- I know, I know.
I'm just being selfish.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.381
And I will support you

27:11.423 --> 27:14.092
in whatever it is
that you decide.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.011
(Birds chirp)

27:17.595 --> 27:20.598
- Okay, Mallory, make sure
you count your strides.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.101
Just go nice and easy.
I wanna see some collection.

27:23.143 --> 27:24.352
Sit up, look where you're going,

27:24.394 --> 27:25.854
Look through your corner.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.272
(Phoenix grunts, rail thumps)

27:27.313 --> 27:29.691
(Amy sighs, hooves thud)

27:29.733 --> 27:31.026
- Whoa...

27:33.695 --> 27:36.406
This sucks! We're never gonna
get any better.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.074
- Come on, Mallory,
you're just too tense.

27:38.116 --> 27:39.576
You need to loosen up a bit.

27:39.617 --> 27:41.119
Why don't you hop back on
and we'll try it again?

27:41.161 --> 27:42.287
- Why? What's the point?

27:42.328 --> 27:43.955
You said I was gonna get better.

27:43.997 --> 27:46.041
Things are actually
getting worse.

27:46.082 --> 27:48.168
- This is déjà vu, Mallory.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.962
We had the exact same argument
in the exact same place

27:51.004 --> 27:53.089
the last time
we worked together.

27:53.131 --> 27:55.300
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

27:55.342 --> 27:58.136
- You're right. Maybe it isn't.

27:58.178 --> 27:59.137
(Hooves thud)

28:01.306 --> 28:04.309
Lou: Okay, prepare to have
your socks knocked off

28:04.351 --> 28:07.604
because my shower gift
for Amy has arrived

28:07.645 --> 28:09.397
and it's a beauty...

28:12.609 --> 28:14.486
What the hell's that?

28:14.527 --> 28:17.739
- I am not even here.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.412
- Mallory, why don't you
just tell me what's going on?

28:24.454 --> 28:25.997
(Brush rasps)

28:26.039 --> 28:28.249
- Nothing is going on.

28:28.291 --> 28:31.586
- No? Because I hear you're
avoiding calls from Jake,

28:31.628 --> 28:35.465
and you lied about coming
from London.

28:35.507 --> 28:38.093
Grandpa told me that you
flew in from Paris.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.011
So whatever it is
you're dealing with,

28:40.053 --> 28:42.389
why don't you just face it,
instead of taking it out on me.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.974
- I just wanna be alone
right now, okay, Amy?

28:45.016 --> 28:48.019
(Approaching footsteps)
- Fine.

28:48.061 --> 28:49.938
(Brush rasps)

28:51.189 --> 28:53.024
- So what's happening in here?

28:53.066 --> 28:55.360
- Oh! I forgot how suffocating
this place could be!

28:55.402 --> 28:57.654
- Okay.

28:57.696 --> 29:01.032
Is there something
you wanna talk about?

29:02.659 --> 29:05.662
- The past year of my life
has been a complete mess, okay?

29:05.704 --> 29:07.622
- Well, I thought you liked it
in London.

29:07.664 --> 29:11.126
- I know what I said,
but I lied.

29:11.167 --> 29:13.128
Flunked out of school,

29:13.169 --> 29:16.339
my flat is shared with four
annoying roommates

29:16.381 --> 29:18.258
and that posh clothing store
where I work -

29:18.299 --> 29:21.177
the wage is barely enough
to keep me afloat.

29:21.219 --> 29:24.806
- Oh, geez, Mallory--
- I miss Heartland, Jack.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.226
I even miss this barn.

29:28.268 --> 29:31.146
All those years mucking out
the stalls...

29:31.187 --> 29:33.940
I love this place.

29:33.982 --> 29:36.568
I've kind of forgotten
who I used to be

29:36.609 --> 29:39.487
and I thought maybe I'd find
a little of the old me

29:39.529 --> 29:41.906
just by being here.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.658
Everything's changed.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.161
Amy's pregnant, Ty's gone.

29:47.579 --> 29:50.248
Katie's all grown up,
doesn't even remember me.

29:50.290 --> 29:54.294
Georgie's a teenager.
I barely even recognized her.

29:54.336 --> 29:57.255
And even you, you don't have
time for me anymore.

29:57.297 --> 29:59.382
We've lost something -

29:59.424 --> 30:02.427
that... that bond we all shared.
It's sad.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.095
- That's not true.

30:04.137 --> 30:05.638
- It is true.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.725
Yesterday, you called me
a guest, Jack.

30:08.767 --> 30:10.727
A guest! I mean, how could you?

30:10.769 --> 30:12.395
I've always thought
of Heartland

30:12.437 --> 30:13.605
like my second home.

30:13.646 --> 30:16.232
- And it always will be,

30:16.274 --> 30:20.195
but you can't expect it
to stay the same.

30:20.236 --> 30:23.198
Life would be pretty boring
if it did.

30:24.449 --> 30:26.868
- True.

30:31.247 --> 30:32.707
- I can't take mine back.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.626
- Well, I can't take mine back.

30:34.668 --> 30:36.127
- Well, what're we gonna do,
Lisa?

30:36.169 --> 30:39.381
Amy doesn't need two identical
strollers. I...

30:39.422 --> 30:40.632
I bought mine weeks ago.

30:40.674 --> 30:42.175
- I bought mine weeks ago too

30:42.217 --> 30:44.344
and Mitch and Jack spent
over an hour yesterday

30:44.386 --> 30:45.720
putting it together. It's...

30:45.762 --> 30:47.722
not going back in the box.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.891
(Clock ticks,
birds chirp outside)

30:51.601 --> 30:53.645
- (Laughs)

30:53.687 --> 30:54.979
- (Laughs)

30:56.439 --> 30:59.234
- Oh... what a mess.

30:59.275 --> 31:00.443
- Great minds think alike.

31:00.485 --> 31:02.487
- (Laughing)

31:02.529 --> 31:05.448
- Okay, of course you're
giving her the stroller.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.492
- No, you've just said
that you can't--

31:07.534 --> 31:08.827
- No, no, no.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.787
You're the sister and you're
giving her the stroller.

31:10.829 --> 31:12.956
We'll think of something else.

31:12.997 --> 31:15.333
- Thank you.

31:15.375 --> 31:17.252
Are you... are you sure?

31:17.293 --> 31:19.963
- Yes. (Takes a deep breath)

31:20.005 --> 31:21.756
He's gonna kill me.

31:21.798 --> 31:25.385
Kill me. (Laughs)

31:25.427 --> 31:27.721
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.764
(Diners chatter,
dishes and utensils clank)

31:33.768 --> 31:36.104
(Coffee cup clunks)

31:36.146 --> 31:39.107
(Door opens and bangs shut)

31:39.149 --> 31:40.358
- Okay, I'm here.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.110
What'd you wanna talk
to me about?

31:43.653 --> 31:46.364
- How could you embarrass me
like that?

31:46.406 --> 31:47.699
- Clay told you?

31:47.741 --> 31:50.326
- Yeah, of course he did!
I was gonna find out anyway.

31:50.368 --> 31:53.121
I'm surprised it wasn't on
the cover of the Hudson Times.

31:53.163 --> 31:55.331
- I'm sorry.

31:55.373 --> 31:58.293
- Why would you do that?
Why would you attack Clay?

31:58.335 --> 32:00.045
- I was... I was jealous.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.463
- Jealous?

32:01.504 --> 32:03.840
I can't stand him! How many
times do I have to tell you?

32:03.882 --> 32:06.259
- But you were texting him...
a lot.

32:06.301 --> 32:07.802
- Yeah. It was about Jade.

32:07.844 --> 32:09.220
I was mad at him for getting
her drunk

32:09.262 --> 32:12.015
before the rodeo last weekend.

32:12.057 --> 32:14.267
Wait.

32:14.309 --> 32:17.562
How did you know
I was texting him?

32:17.604 --> 32:20.273
- I... I kind of read your texts
while I was...

32:20.315 --> 32:22.484
using your tablet
to film the memorial.

32:22.525 --> 32:25.445
- You read my texts?!

32:25.487 --> 32:27.614
I can't believe this!
Do you trust me at all?

32:27.655 --> 32:31.284
- It's not you, it's Clay.
I don't trust him.

32:31.326 --> 32:34.537
- Whatever. I can't even
look at you right now.

32:34.579 --> 32:37.332
(Receding footsteps)

32:37.374 --> 32:38.667
- (Sighs heavily)

32:41.544 --> 32:43.672
(Birds chirp)

32:43.713 --> 32:45.006
(Purposeful footsteps)

32:46.299 --> 32:47.217
- Is that Amy?

32:47.258 --> 32:49.636
- Yeah, she's about a week old
there.

32:49.678 --> 32:51.763
- Oh, look at Ty! They're gonna
have such a cute baby.

32:51.805 --> 32:53.014
- I know.

32:53.056 --> 32:55.600
Lisa, can I give you hand?
- Yes, I would love one.

32:58.645 --> 33:01.356
- You're awfully quiet today.

33:01.398 --> 33:02.691
- Turns out my amazing
boyfriend

33:02.732 --> 33:04.609
wasn't so amazing after all.

33:04.651 --> 33:06.653
Katie: (Gasps) She's coming!
She's coming!

33:06.695 --> 33:09.364
Lou: Watch your step.
Amy: (Laughs)

33:10.573 --> 33:13.201
Okay, over here,
a little farther...

33:15.620 --> 33:18.123
A little bit farther...
- (Laughs) Katie...

33:18.164 --> 33:19.708
- Okay, and...

33:21.668 --> 33:23.628
All: Surprise!

33:23.670 --> 33:25.714
- A baby shower! You guys!

33:27.298 --> 33:29.759
- I think you knew already.
(Laughs)

33:29.801 --> 33:31.136
- Thank you, guys, so much.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.513
- Oh... I'm glad you're happy.

33:33.555 --> 33:34.806
- Thank you, Katie.

33:34.848 --> 33:37.308
- Okay, let's get this party
started.

33:37.350 --> 33:38.393
Who wants to play some games?

33:38.435 --> 33:40.854
- Really, Lou?
- No games.

33:40.895 --> 33:43.273
- Let's eat something.
- Absolutely!

33:43.314 --> 33:46.276
- Let's eat!
- That's a good idea. (Laughs)

33:46.317 --> 33:48.570
(Birds chirp, footsteps thud)

33:50.447 --> 33:52.157
(Mitch exhales, Phoenix grunts)

33:52.198 --> 33:53.867
- Hey!

33:53.908 --> 33:55.326
What're you doing in here?

33:55.368 --> 33:57.287
I thought you supposed
to be at the shower?

33:57.328 --> 33:59.873
- Mm... I need the break.
Estrogen overload.

33:59.914 --> 34:01.583
(Phoenix grunts)
- Oh...

34:05.253 --> 34:07.756
- So I hear you're leaving
Heartland.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.760
- Wow, news travels fast.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.806
Uh, yeah,
I'm thinking about it.

34:16.848 --> 34:19.516
Haven't made up my mind yet.

34:19.559 --> 34:22.562
- Well, I wouldn't make any
rash decisions.

34:22.603 --> 34:23.855
I left this place
three years ago

34:23.897 --> 34:26.274
and I still think about it
every day.

34:28.902 --> 34:30.695
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

34:32.572 --> 34:33.697
(Hooves stamp on floor)

34:33.739 --> 34:35.116
(Phoenix chews)

34:36.493 --> 34:38.536
(Birds chirp)

34:38.578 --> 34:42.331
Amy: Mallory, this is great.
Thank you.

34:42.373 --> 34:43.875
(Bag rustles)

34:43.917 --> 34:45.460
From you?

34:45.502 --> 34:46.878
(Paper rustles)

34:46.920 --> 34:50.255
Oh no, these are way too cute!

34:50.297 --> 34:52.592
Look how tiny they are!
(Laughs)

34:54.344 --> 34:56.388
Lou: I'm next!
(Stroller rattles)

34:56.429 --> 34:59.516
- Lou! Are you serious?

34:59.557 --> 35:01.393
Wow!
- I know it seems like a lot,

35:01.434 --> 35:03.645
but this is gonna be really
really helpful for you.

35:03.687 --> 35:06.272
Oh, I love it! Thank you.

35:06.314 --> 35:08.692
- Who's next?
- Me!

35:08.733 --> 35:10.485
Amy: Katie?

35:11.695 --> 35:12.821
What's this? Will you help me
unwrap it?

35:12.862 --> 35:13.988
- Mm-hmm!

35:14.030 --> 35:16.116
(Paper rustles and tears)

35:16.157 --> 35:19.619
- Katie, it's your Pogy.
I can't have this.

35:20.912 --> 35:22.706
- I want the baby to have it.

35:22.747 --> 35:24.332
- You sure?

35:24.374 --> 35:26.668
- Mm-hmm.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.461
- (Sighs) Well, thank you.

35:28.503 --> 35:29.671
I'll take very good care
of him.

35:29.713 --> 35:31.840
- Okay.

35:31.881 --> 35:33.341
(Katie sighs,
Amy chuckles softly)

35:33.383 --> 35:35.343
- Hey, you got time
for one more?

35:35.385 --> 35:37.387
- Of course, Grandpa.
Come on in.

35:37.429 --> 35:40.598
- This is from me and Lisa.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.434
(Box rattles)

35:42.475 --> 35:44.853
See, that's the rocking chair

35:46.521 --> 35:50.275
that we started to make
for your loft.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.901
It's not quite done yet.

35:51.943 --> 35:54.112
I still have to teach Lisa
the difference

35:54.154 --> 35:55.613
between a sander and a grinder.

35:55.655 --> 35:58.742
- Oh, please.
- I love it!

35:58.783 --> 36:00.910
Thank you both so much.

36:00.952 --> 36:03.580
- I love you.

36:03.621 --> 36:05.498
(Light slap)

36:06.916 --> 36:09.127
- I want to make a toast.

36:09.169 --> 36:12.005
To Ty and Amy
and their new baby!

36:12.047 --> 36:14.007
Kate: Amy and Ty
and the new baby!

36:14.049 --> 36:16.551
All: (Chuckling) Cheers!
Katie: Cheers!

36:16.593 --> 36:18.261
- Thank you all. (Chuckles)

36:18.303 --> 36:20.013
Lou: Cheers to you.

36:20.055 --> 36:22.891
Cheers. Cheers.
(All giggling)

36:24.642 --> 36:26.686
Katie: Let's open up that one.
Amy: All right.

36:26.728 --> 36:29.856
Lou: Who's that from?
Amy: Um, well...

36:29.898 --> 36:31.733
(Door snicks open)

36:33.902 --> 36:35.403
(Door snaps closed)

36:37.530 --> 36:39.783
- What're you doing here?

36:39.824 --> 36:42.077
- These are for you.

36:42.118 --> 36:44.704
(Footsteps thunk lightly,
birds chirp)

36:45.914 --> 36:49.042
(Cellophane rustles)
- Thanks.

36:49.084 --> 36:51.086
- I feel terrible
for what I did.

36:51.127 --> 36:53.004
I know how I behaved was wrong

36:53.046 --> 36:56.132
and I promise to never
do it again.

36:56.174 --> 36:58.927
- I don't know if I can
forgive you.

36:58.968 --> 37:00.929
- Please, Georgie.

37:00.970 --> 37:02.597
I've never been in
a relationship before.

37:02.639 --> 37:04.015
I have no idea what I'm doing.

37:04.057 --> 37:06.768
- Neither do I, but I would
never read your texts,

37:06.810 --> 37:09.479
or pick a fight with someone.
- I know.

37:09.521 --> 37:10.855
It's just sometimes
it's hard to believe

37:10.897 --> 37:12.440
that someone as cool as you
would wanna date me--

37:12.482 --> 37:15.276
- Just stop.

37:19.030 --> 37:22.534
- Thank you for the flowers
and the apology,

37:22.575 --> 37:24.953
but I can't be with someone
who doesn't trust me.

37:24.994 --> 37:26.496
- I-I do trust you.

37:26.538 --> 37:29.541
- But now I can't trust you.

37:29.582 --> 37:31.626
That's just the way it is.

37:33.128 --> 37:34.963
(Cellophane rustles)

37:37.132 --> 37:39.718
- So, what?
You're breaking up with me?

37:41.761 --> 37:44.305
- Yeah, I think I am.

37:46.474 --> 37:48.727
(Footsteps thunk)

37:54.691 --> 37:55.650
(Door snaps shut)

37:55.692 --> 37:58.528
**

37:58.570 --> 38:01.656
(Jacket rustles,
low hum of chatter)

38:04.909 --> 38:06.036
- (Exhales heavily)

38:06.077 --> 38:15.503
**

38:15.545 --> 38:16.963
(Exhales)

38:21.134 --> 38:24.095
(Birds chirp)

38:24.137 --> 38:25.638
- You know, I'm sorry
I never made it back

38:25.680 --> 38:27.057
for your prenatal classes.

38:27.098 --> 38:28.892
I still feel bad about that.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.061
- Actually, going with Dad
wasn't that bad.

38:31.102 --> 38:34.147
- Really?
- I'm serious.

38:34.189 --> 38:37.025
Besides, Lou, it's not the
classes that I care about.

38:37.067 --> 38:38.818
It's all this other stuff.

38:38.860 --> 38:40.945
I don't know what I would've
done without you bugging me.

38:40.987 --> 38:43.782
I probably wouldn't have
survived this pregnancy.

38:43.823 --> 38:46.785
- Yeah, well, I'm just glad
I could be of some help.

38:50.163 --> 38:52.499
- Something bugging you?
You just seem down.

38:53.875 --> 38:56.336
- Yeah.
No, I'm fine. I just...

38:57.629 --> 38:58.838
(Blows out her breath)

38:58.880 --> 39:02.676
It's just stupid Mitch stuff.
Again.

39:02.717 --> 39:05.220
I don't wanna keep burdening
you with my drama.

39:05.261 --> 39:07.972
- You're not burdening me.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.308
What is it? Is he leaving?

39:10.350 --> 39:13.144
- I don't know.
Ever since I told him

39:13.186 --> 39:16.022
that I would support him
no matter what,

39:16.064 --> 39:19.818
I haven't heard from him.
So... (exhales sharply)

39:19.859 --> 39:22.487
I don't know what's going on.

39:27.534 --> 39:29.411
(Shovel scrapes)

39:30.995 --> 39:33.498
(Bag thuds lightly)

39:33.540 --> 39:35.542
(Shovel scrapes)

39:38.878 --> 39:42.173
- Hey. Easy on that shovel,
killer.

39:42.215 --> 39:44.092
(Shovel scrapes)

39:46.094 --> 39:47.554
You okay?

39:48.972 --> 39:51.766
Do you wanna...
do you wanna talk about it?

39:51.808 --> 39:53.852
- (Crying) Guys suck
at communication.

39:57.439 --> 39:59.524
- Well, don't go lumping us all
into one group.

40:00.817 --> 40:02.110
- Why can't you just talk
about things

40:02.152 --> 40:04.654
instead of letting them
get all messed up?

40:04.696 --> 40:07.198
- Well, you know, you girls

40:07.240 --> 40:10.118
can be pretty intimidating
sometimes.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.412
It's not always easy for us
to say what's on our minds.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.082
This relationship stuff
is pretty...

40:16.124 --> 40:18.043
it's pretty hard.

40:18.084 --> 40:19.836
(Wheelbarrow rattles)

40:19.878 --> 40:20.962
Georgie?

40:21.004 --> 40:22.797
(Wheelbarrow rattles)

40:23.923 --> 40:26.468
Okay...

40:26.509 --> 40:27.969
Lou: Hey.

40:28.011 --> 40:30.388
What-what was that about?
Is-is Georgie okay?

40:30.430 --> 40:33.433
- Yeah. (Latch clunks)
Just some boy stuff.

40:33.475 --> 40:35.560
I'm sure she'll tell you
when she's ready.

40:35.602 --> 40:37.645
- (Sighs) Okay.

40:37.687 --> 40:39.606
- Uh... Lou, I...

40:40.815 --> 40:43.151
I made a decision.

40:43.193 --> 40:45.070
- Oh yeah?

40:48.198 --> 40:50.450
- I've decided to stay.

40:52.035 --> 40:55.038
- No.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.915
- What? I thought you'd be
happy.

40:56.956 --> 40:58.833
- I don't want you to give up
this opportunity

40:58.875 --> 41:00.210
if you're doing it for me.

41:00.251 --> 41:01.836
- (Amused sigh)

41:03.129 --> 41:07.008
Look, the truth is
I like working here.

41:07.050 --> 41:10.220
It makes me feel like
part of the family.

41:10.261 --> 41:13.431
I think I'd miss that
if I left.

41:13.473 --> 41:16.685
- Well, what about this job
opportunity in Calgary?

41:16.726 --> 41:18.770
- My career aspirations...

41:18.812 --> 41:20.647
they can be put on hold.

41:22.649 --> 41:24.234
- Okay.

41:24.275 --> 41:26.945
So does this mean
what I think it means?

41:28.238 --> 41:31.574
'Cause I don't wanna rush you
and I know that--

41:31.616 --> 41:37.372
**

41:37.414 --> 41:38.790
- What does that tell you?

41:38.832 --> 41:40.750
- (Amused sigh)

41:40.792 --> 41:47.298
**

41:47.340 --> 41:50.760
Amy: Oh, and this is
from Mallory.

41:50.802 --> 41:53.221
- What is it?
- It's a bath set.

41:53.263 --> 41:56.099
- Oh! (Laughs) Right.
Of course.

41:56.141 --> 41:57.267
- (Laughs) This is the tub,

41:57.308 --> 42:00.103
and then - oh! - these are
the little washcloths

42:00.145 --> 42:02.022
and a towel.

42:02.063 --> 42:05.734
Oh, uh, these.
Aren't they adorable?

42:05.775 --> 42:07.444
They're so tiny...

42:07.485 --> 42:09.779
- Wow! That's a lot of stuff.

42:09.821 --> 42:11.031
Amy: I know.

42:11.072 --> 42:13.324
I'm feeling pretty spoiled
right now.

42:13.366 --> 42:16.161
We have everything we need for
the little nugget's arrival.

42:16.202 --> 42:18.496
All I'm missing is you.

42:18.538 --> 42:20.248
- Well, we're on the home
stretch now.

42:20.290 --> 42:22.375
Only a couple more weeks.

42:22.417 --> 42:24.961
- I can't wait.
- Me neither.

42:25.003 --> 42:28.923
* ...like a river, sweet *

42:28.965 --> 42:32.218
* 'Cause I will carry you,
carry you, *

42:32.260 --> 42:35.972
* Carry you away from it all *

42:36.014 --> 42:37.891
(Hooves thud)

42:37.932 --> 42:40.101
* I won't let you fall *

42:40.143 --> 42:42.062
(Phoenix grunts)

42:42.103 --> 42:45.398
* 'Cause I will lift you up,
lift you up *

42:45.440 --> 42:47.359
* Lift you up into the light *

42:47.400 --> 42:49.194
(Distorted thud)

42:50.403 --> 42:54.866
* So don't close your eyes *

42:54.908 --> 42:56.951
* Till the morning *

42:58.244 --> 43:00.497
(Hooves plod heavily)

43:00.538 --> 43:02.707
(Hooves thud lightly,
Phoenix grunts)

43:02.749 --> 43:04.793
- Not bad, huh?

43:04.834 --> 43:06.878
- You're looking pretty good
out there.

43:06.920 --> 43:10.590
- Amy was right.
It just took some time.

43:10.632 --> 43:13.968
- So, how long you plan on
sticking around?

43:14.010 --> 43:15.387
- Trying to get rid of me
already, Jack?

43:15.428 --> 43:17.847
(Jack laughs, hooves thud)

43:17.889 --> 43:20.225
**

43:20.266 --> 43:22.727
* Let it all begin *

43:22.769 --> 43:23.978
(Tack jingles)

43:25.271 --> 43:27.982
- Jake? What're you doing here?

43:28.024 --> 43:29.067
**

43:29.109 --> 43:31.111
* Let it all begin *

43:31.152 --> 43:34.614
**
