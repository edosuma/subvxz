WEBVTT

00:04.134 --> 00:06.484
PHOEBE:
That's not me.

00:06.658 --> 00:08.051
Sure looks like you.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.618
No. I mean, the picture's me.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.098
Just the column is not me.

00:11.272 --> 00:13.230
I knew a man
couldn't give advice

00:13.404 --> 00:15.058
like a woman.

00:15.232 --> 00:18.409
Men are all about, you know,
like, fixing the problem.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.716
Isn't that what advice
columnists are supposed to do?

00:20.890 --> 00:23.588
No. I-I
mean, yes.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.721
But, you know,
first you're supposed to listen.

00:25.895 --> 00:26.939
Then you're supposed

00:27.114 --> 00:28.332
to validate
feelings.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.204
At least that's what
a woman would do.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.902
But not a man.
They go straight to fixing it.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.338
I mean this "Glass Ceiling

00:34.512 --> 00:37.298
in Sausalito,"-- Leslie
tells this woman

00:37.472 --> 00:39.343
step-by-step
how to deal with her boss.

00:39.517 --> 00:41.476
There are no feelings in there,
no emotions.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.608
I mean, my readers
are gonna read that,

00:43.782 --> 00:46.176
and they're gonna know
that I did not write it.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.351
This is a nightmare.

00:47.525 --> 00:48.961
Honestly,

00:49.136 --> 00:50.006
it's real subtle.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.921
They might not notice.

00:52.095 --> 00:53.444
Even the letters that he picks--

00:53.618 --> 00:55.229
they're all "fix-it" letters,
you know?

00:55.403 --> 00:57.622
And I left him three messages
about this yesterday.

00:57.796 --> 00:59.102
He did not call me back.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.017
I thought the whole point

01:01.191 --> 01:04.977
of this little vacation was
for you to relax and recharge.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.589
Yeah, I know, but it's still
my column, you know?

01:07.763 --> 01:09.460
I still care about it.

01:09.634 --> 01:12.246
Any big change takes
some adjusting, so for a while,

01:12.420 --> 01:14.117
you're just gonna feel
a little lost.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.815
See? You just validated
my feelings.

01:16.989 --> 01:19.166
Phoebe, you need
to stop obsessing.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.950
Unless, of course, you know,
you're obsessing

01:21.124 --> 01:23.909
'cause, um, you like him.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.172
No, I don't like him.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.261
He's like... whoo!

01:27.435 --> 01:29.219
Well, then, forget about it,

01:29.393 --> 01:31.308
and find something else
to obsess about.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.397
Yeah, I know you're right.
I have to find a way

01:33.571 --> 01:34.920
to channel
my energy,

01:35.095 --> 01:36.792
find something
to be passionate about.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.315
You know.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.665
Paige with Magic School,
you saving Leo...

01:40.839 --> 01:42.798
I'm not saving him, I'm just...

01:42.972 --> 01:45.975
hoping that by spending some
time with the boys,

01:46.149 --> 01:50.022
that he'll feel loved and needed

01:50.197 --> 01:52.068
and realize that life
isn't all that bad.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.722
Excuse me ladies,
but I'm afraid

01:53.896 --> 01:55.376
you're gonna have
to take that someplace else.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.291
Take what?You know...

01:57.465 --> 01:58.814
that.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.381
It's called
breast feeding.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.513
Customers are complaining.

02:02.687 --> 02:03.993
Well...

02:04.167 --> 02:05.560
what?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.606
All right, let's go.
I gotta go anyway.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.478
No, Piper you're not going
anywhere.

02:10.652 --> 02:11.566
You've done nothing wrong.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.220
You can't do this.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.830
Actually, yeah, I can.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.010
Sorry.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.403
It's no big deal, let's go.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.318
That's horrible! You...

02:24.492 --> 02:25.667
We're going.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.321
REX:
This is a losing battle.

02:27.495 --> 02:30.150
Magic School was
a noble experiment.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.282
But I'm afraid
it's run its course.

02:32.456 --> 02:33.718
Well, what about these kids?

02:33.892 --> 02:35.459
Where are they going to go?

02:35.633 --> 02:37.548
Where are they gonna learn how
to develop their magic?

02:37.722 --> 02:39.942
Where did you learn
to develop yours?

02:40.116 --> 02:41.552
I learned from my sisters,

02:41.726 --> 02:43.554
and they did from their mother
and their grandmother.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.513
But not everybody has that.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.254
What these kids need...

02:51.214 --> 02:53.477
What these kids need
is guidance.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.959
The point remains, that with
Gideon no longer around,

02:57.133 --> 02:58.961
the safety of this institution,

02:59.135 --> 03:02.007
both to the students
and to the outside world

03:02.182 --> 03:03.444
can no longer be guaranteed.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.141
I can guarantee it.

03:06.142 --> 03:09.101
I mean, I can try
to guarantee it.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.408
See, I fight demons
on a weekly basis,

03:11.582 --> 03:13.497
and I think that more
than qualifies me

03:13.671 --> 03:16.065
to be able to deal with
some magical students.

03:20.112 --> 03:24.334
Like I said,
they need some guidance.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.425
She can guide me any day.

03:28.599 --> 03:29.557
Check it out,

03:29.731 --> 03:31.733
I just cast an awesome spell.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.256

It's okay, Duncan,

I know you didn't mean to.

poof, out popped Lady Godiva.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.706
That's Lady Godiva.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.317
That is so cool.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.535
I mean, it's not cool.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.189
But it's okay,

05:20.363 --> 05:22.060
you just send her back and
everything will be fine.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.932
Yeah, well that's the thing, I
don't know how to send her back.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.063
I only know how to conjure her.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.891
Okay, that is bad.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.676
I mean not that you're bad,
this is a bad situation,

05:28.850 --> 05:29.981
you know what I mean,
but I know

05:30.155 --> 05:31.069
you didn't mean it
so you're not really

05:31.243 --> 05:32.984
bad... It's okay. It's okay.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.769
Uh... we'll fix it.

05:37.598 --> 05:38.729
I hope.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.042
Uh, need to borrow this.
I'll have it dry cleaned.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.174
Is that who I think it is?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.611
Lady Godiva.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.308
Pretty impressive
use of magic, huh?

05:52.482 --> 05:54.310
Don't you know how dangerous
it is to mess with history?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.356
If we don't find a way
to send her back

05:56.530 --> 05:57.879
before anything happens
to her...

05:58.053 --> 05:59.794
I'm all over it.

That's it! Shoo!

Get out of here! Get out

Where am I? What
is this place?

06:11.414 --> 06:12.981
It's okay, you're safe.

I'm going to take
you home, okay?

Well, well, well, that's one
screwed up mess you made.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.771
Good job, Duncan.
You scored big.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.861
Shut up, Simon,
leave me alone.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.863
Say good bye
to magic school.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.735
Such intense
frustration,

06:27.909 --> 06:29.214

06:29.389 --> 06:31.695
Let me help
you let it out.

Duncan just got us evicted.

Hey, break it up.

06:45.753 --> 06:46.754
Interesting.

06:50.192 --> 06:55.153
I have a very
good feeling about this.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.766
Piper,
I can't believe you

06:58.940 --> 07:00.855
of all people
are against this.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.944
We have to do something.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.598
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.121
You are not
writing a letter

07:06.295 --> 07:08.079
to Ask Phoebe
about my breast.

07:08.253 --> 07:09.516
Leo.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.778
You're the one that said
I needed a cause.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.519
Shh.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.738
Yeah, so you could keep your
mind off of the column,

07:14.912 --> 07:16.348
not write a letter to it.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.438
How am I supposed to keep
my mind off of the column

07:18.612 --> 07:20.962
when he's about to blow my
cover, maybe even my career?!

07:21.136 --> 07:22.398
Okay, you're obsessing.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.095
Leo, you're late.

07:24.269 --> 07:25.880
Well, I don't know what
you're worried about,

07:26.054 --> 07:28.056
it's not like he's going
to pick the letter anyway,

07:28.230 --> 07:29.361
it's way too feminine.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.928
I'm worried because
somehow I know

07:31.102 --> 07:31.973
you're going find a way

07:32.147 --> 07:33.278
to make him pick it.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.845
So what? Then
we hit two Neanderthals

07:35.019 --> 07:36.586
with one stone.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.109
I cannot believe you're not
supporting me in this.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.415
What is there
to support?

07:39.589 --> 07:41.286
Phoebe, it's
already a law.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.810
So let's sue the manager.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.464
I don't have time
to sue the manager,

07:44.638 --> 07:46.378
I have other things
to worry about like work.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.293
Yeah, I'm on sabbatical,

07:48.468 --> 07:49.686
I don't have
to worry about that.

07:49.860 --> 07:50.861
I'm lost.

For crying out
loud, Leo.

still upstairs?

08:00.175 --> 08:01.350
Wait a minute.
Hold it.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.874
What happened?

08:04.048 --> 08:05.876
Well, uh...

08:06.050 --> 08:07.051
this is Godiva.

08:07.225 --> 08:08.618
Mmm, say hello.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.316
Godiva?

08:11.491 --> 08:15.582
As in, um...
Lady Godiva, uh...

08:15.756 --> 08:18.236

so to speak.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.281
Are they witches, too?

08:19.455 --> 08:20.674
Yeah...

08:20.848 --> 08:21.849
see the meeting
kind of went long,

08:22.023 --> 08:23.372

boring and...

08:23.546 --> 08:25.505
the kids... they
grew restless and...

08:25.679 --> 08:27.332
So they conjured
a sex object?

08:27.507 --> 08:28.986
I am no sex object.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.206
I was riding through town
in my natural state

08:31.380 --> 08:33.600

unjust taxes.

ride or else it could change...

08:44.088 --> 08:46.569
Yeah, history
as we know it, I got it.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.658
But even worse,
if I don't send her back soon,

08:48.832 --> 08:51.139
I'm pretty sure the Elders are
going to shut down Magic School.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.924

changing the course of history.

how much history

09:01.192 --> 09:03.455
could a naked lady on
horseback really affect?

to make the time.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.945
every threat, besides,
even if you did,

09:58.119 --> 10:00.251
it doesn't change
the fact that...

10:00.425 --> 10:02.732
I killed another Elder?

10:02.906 --> 10:04.995
Yeah, but it wasn't your fault.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.606
It doesn't change the facts.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.651
The fact is
the boys need a father.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.740
And that's really
all that matters.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.264
And I can't understand
why you're focusing
on all this bad stuff

10:13.438 --> 10:16.572
when you have some
good stuff in your life.

10:16.746 --> 10:17.921
[groans]

10:28.366 --> 10:29.759
Uh, hi...

10:29.933 --> 10:31.718
could you please not do that
around the children?

10:31.892 --> 10:33.197
You brought them here.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.112
Actually no, your son
brought us here.

10:35.286 --> 10:36.853
Look, Piper, the word is there's
a scouter demon in the swamp,

10:37.027 --> 10:38.115
and if I don't go there...

10:38.289 --> 10:39.856
If I don't spend
some time in P3,

10:40.030 --> 10:42.119
we will lose
our only source of income.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.252
I can't do this, you know.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.688
Yes, you can.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.037
Just make sure you burp Chris,

10:47.211 --> 10:48.735
and you will be fine.

10:48.909 --> 10:51.085
Now I got to go, so...
help me out.

11:19.591 --> 11:20.810
Phoebe.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.420
Hi.

11:22.594 --> 11:23.813
What are you doing here?

11:23.987 --> 11:26.686
I... I came to look for
my favorite pen.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.296
I know I left it
in here somewhere

11:28.470 --> 11:29.906
and I can't seem to write
a thing without it.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.473
Well, I dumped
all your stuff

11:31.647 --> 11:32.866
in this bottom cabinet here.

11:33.040 --> 11:33.954
Oh, you dumped?

11:34.128 --> 11:35.738
What does it look like?

11:35.912 --> 11:37.566
Uh...

11:37.740 --> 11:39.394
it's a fountain pen,

11:39.568 --> 11:41.309
nothing really special.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.920
Hey, um, since I'm here,
maybe I can help...

11:44.094 --> 11:45.182
with stuff.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.445
Help?
Yeah, you know,

11:47.619 --> 11:50.448
maybe help pick tomorrow's
letter or something.

11:50.622 --> 11:51.928
I thought you were
on sabbatical.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.669
Still my column.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.106
Ah, having a little trouble
letting go, I see.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.848
No. I'm not having
trouble letting go.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.242
I just came here
to find my pen.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.244
Give it a couple weeks,
you won't even notice.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.812
Yeah, I'm afraid my readers
are already noticing.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.814
That you can't find
your pen?

12:07.988 --> 12:09.119
That I'm a man.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.687
I mean, that,
that you're a man

12:11.861 --> 12:13.254
when you're supposed
to be woman.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.821
And you're not very good
at picking the letters,

12:14.995 --> 12:16.692
you only pick problems
that you can solve.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.520
You know, for someone
taking a break,

12:18.694 --> 12:20.130
you've sure given this
a lot of thought.

12:20.304 --> 12:23.046
No, I'm just saying,
you know, that...

12:23.220 --> 12:25.832
that... I mean,
I mean, the point...

12:26.006 --> 12:28.660
What was I saying?

12:28.835 --> 12:34.275
Something to do with
me Tarzan, you Jane.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.103
Yeah, cute.
Very cute.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.844
Let's see...

12:38.018 --> 12:39.367
Oh, what's this one?

12:39.541 --> 12:41.978
Oh, this looks like
a great one.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.675
"Breast Feeding
in Bayshore."

12:43.850 --> 12:46.635
What do you say?Breast feeding?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.768
It seems a little causey,
don't you think?

12:48.942 --> 12:50.030
Out of your league?

12:50.204 --> 12:51.683
No no, I like breasts,

12:51.858 --> 12:53.250
I just don't feel the need

12:53.424 --> 12:54.730
to give any advice
on them, that's all.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.863
Yeah. Like I said,

12:57.037 --> 12:58.168
you're not good
at picking letters.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.996
So...

13:00.170 --> 13:03.652
if you find my pen,
please call me.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.225
Okay...

13:11.399 --> 13:13.357
Queen Elizabeth...

13:13.531 --> 13:15.403
Catherine the Great...

13:15.577 --> 13:17.100
Joan of Arc...

13:17.274 --> 13:20.103
Ah, Lady Godiva.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.149
Good thing
you have long hair.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.368
I'm in the history books?

13:24.542 --> 13:27.284
Yes, and if I can keep anything
from happening to you

13:27.458 --> 13:29.286
before I send you back,
you'll remain there.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.338
What's wrong?

13:37.512 --> 13:38.687
Lord Dyson.

13:38.861 --> 13:39.731
Is that your husband?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.559
No.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.779
An evil land baron who feeds
on the pain of peasants--

13:43.953 --> 13:45.215
suppresses them
for his own gain.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.261
He's the weasel who
convinced my husband

13:47.435 --> 13:48.610
to tax them.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.960
Weren't you scared,
doing what you did?

13:51.134 --> 13:52.483
I mean, that was what,
about a thousand years

13:52.657 --> 13:54.355
before women received
equal rights?

13:54.529 --> 13:55.747
It was the right thing to do.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.053
It's the only
way to make

13:57.227 --> 13:58.446
my husband see
that I was serious

13:58.620 --> 14:00.056
about my stand, to shock him.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.797
And history, too, apparently.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.365
Okay, mount up.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.023
Will it be painful?

14:10.197 --> 14:12.503
No, it's magic.

14:12.677 --> 14:13.591
You won't feel a thing.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.767
Magic.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.769
I didn't think
it really existed.

14:17.944 --> 14:21.425
Oh, it exists, it's just
something that's hidden.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.166
You can't see it.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.429
I see not a lot of things
have changed.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.177
Uh... robe?

14:34.351 --> 14:37.789
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:40.314 --> 14:43.186
Good luck, saving all this.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.361
Thanks.

14:44.535 --> 14:45.797
Good luck on your ride.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.238
"From lands afar,
and time and space,

14:51.412 --> 14:53.588
"take her now
from this our place.

14:53.762 --> 14:58.332
One that dwells so must remain,
send her back to her domain."

15:00.073 --> 15:02.075
What's wrong?

15:02.249 --> 15:04.512
I don't know,
it should have worked.

15:04.686 --> 15:05.817
[banging, yelling]

15:05.992 --> 15:07.384
[plates shattering]

15:07.558 --> 15:08.603
Stay here.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.916
What happened?You tell me.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.353
You were the one who said you
could control these students.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.094
Okay, well, I don't see
how conjuring Lady Godiva

15:21.268 --> 15:22.573
could have caused all of this.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.358
Unless she wasn't
the only thing conjured.

15:25.794 --> 15:26.926
Boxes!

15:28.318 --> 15:29.754
[yelling]

15:31.278 --> 15:33.149
Well, at least this shows
how much kids need help

15:33.323 --> 15:34.629
learning to control their magic.

15:35.717 --> 15:36.979
This is a disaster.

15:37.153 --> 15:37.980
A complete,

15:38.154 --> 15:39.634
utter disaster.

15:39.808 --> 15:42.854
By all means, don't
repress yourself.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.990
Ah, to be whole again.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.383
Who the hell are you?

15:49.557 --> 15:53.256
I've had it with you
and your stupid ideas.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.610
So much repression to feed on.

15:59.784 --> 16:00.785
[chuckles]

16:01.917 --> 16:03.179
You.

16:04.267 --> 16:05.790
Milady.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.228
Watch out!

16:10.795 --> 16:12.667
Ah, no matter.

16:12.841 --> 16:17.193
I'll just collect more power
and then I'll be back.

16:26.115 --> 16:28.378
Ah, it's okay.
It's just a graze.

16:28.552 --> 16:31.207
I still can't believe
an Elder attacked you.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.861
I know; they're supposed
to be pacifists, right?

16:33.035 --> 16:35.733
Ha, have you
seen Leo lately?

16:35.907 --> 16:36.996
Speaking of which...

16:37.170 --> 16:38.867
Leo!

16:39.041 --> 16:41.435
Mm, he's a little mad at me
and I can't say I blame him.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.785
I did kind of
mess things up.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.483
Well, that doesn't explain
why he tried to kill you.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.181
Pardon me.

16:48.355 --> 16:49.791
I think the demon
did something to that Elder,

16:49.965 --> 16:52.185
got him to free up
his repressed anger somehow.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.970
Oh, probably wasn't
breast-fed as a child.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.145
Phoebe!

16:56.319 --> 16:58.060
What?

16:58.234 --> 17:00.410
Well, either way, we wouldn't
even be in this situation--

17:00.584 --> 17:02.673
this demon wouldn't even be
here, if I hadn't have had

17:02.847 --> 17:05.415
the great stroke of genius
to try to save school.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.504
So, why do you think
he tried to kill her?

17:07.678 --> 17:08.940
If I could just...

17:09.115 --> 17:10.420
PAIGE:
Maybe he knew
what I didn't know,

17:10.594 --> 17:11.595
which is that since
they came together,

17:11.769 --> 17:12.988
they have to
leave together.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.033
Yeah, but why wouldn't
he want to go back?

17:14.207 --> 17:16.078
If you would just listen to me.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.514
Oh, wow!

17:17.688 --> 17:19.081
PIPER:
Wow! For...

17:19.255 --> 17:20.430
That's just a lot...

17:20.604 --> 17:21.779
[sighs]

17:21.953 --> 17:23.955
It is apparently
still the only way

17:24.130 --> 17:25.957
I can get anybody
to listen to me.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.090
Woman, keep your clothes on.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.614
This is a family show, really.

17:34.314 --> 17:38.753
I know that man...
or "demon," as you call him.

17:38.927 --> 17:39.928
It's Lord Dyson.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.364
The land baron?

17:41.538 --> 17:44.411
Except in my time,
he was different.

17:44.585 --> 17:45.847
Smaller, weaker.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.806
Okay,
so how did he get stronger?

17:48.980 --> 17:50.504
[doorbell rings]

17:50.678 --> 17:53.159
It's okay-- doorbell--
newfangled contraption.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.555
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, it's Leslie.

17:58.729 --> 17:59.687
PIPER:
Don't answer it.

17:59.861 --> 18:00.775
What if it's about my letter?

18:00.949 --> 18:02.298
Forget the stupid letter.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.300
Oh, what, can everyone have
a cause but me?

18:04.474 --> 18:05.736
Yes!

18:05.910 --> 18:07.086
Ugh... Upstairs.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.261
Upstairs!

18:09.305 --> 18:10.741
Leslie.

18:10.915 --> 18:13.527
Hey, what a surprise.

18:13.701 --> 18:14.963
I brought you
a peace offering.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.490
Oh, those are my sisters.

18:20.664 --> 18:21.622
I thought you just had two.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.537
Yeah, the other one is a cousin.

18:23.711 --> 18:24.625
Distant cousin,

18:24.799 --> 18:26.757
t-twice removed.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.629
Come in, come in.

18:29.717 --> 18:32.372
So... you drove
all the way over here

18:32.546 --> 18:34.243
just to give me
this lovely pen?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.419
Well, it's your
pen, isn't it?

18:36.593 --> 18:38.465
You know
this is not my pen.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.162
You're right.

18:40.336 --> 18:41.816
Bought that from a street
vendor on my way over.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.209
Just looking for an excuse.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.297
[laughs nervously]

18:44.471 --> 18:46.386
You have a nice place.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.996
The paper pays you
better than I thought.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.172
So what are you
really doing here?

18:50.346 --> 18:54.437
I thought you might like
a chance to apologize.

18:54.611 --> 18:55.917
O... Oh?

18:56.091 --> 18:57.919
For what?

18:58.093 --> 18:59.964
Well, for trying to slip that
breast-feeding letter past me.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.923
[laughing]:
W-What?!

19:02.097 --> 19:03.185
Look, I know you wrote it.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.230
I recognize your
handwriting, Phoebe.

19:04.404 --> 19:05.622
I've studied all your work.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.058
You have?

19:07.233 --> 19:08.756
Well, yeah, how else
am I gonna get away

19:08.930 --> 19:10.627
with ghost writing
a column for you?

19:10.801 --> 19:12.760
Yeah, see,
that's the problem.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.197
I actually don't think
you're getting away with it.

19:15.371 --> 19:16.851
Because I'm a man.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.332
No, because you pick letters
a man would pick.

19:19.506 --> 19:22.422
"Ask Phoebe" wouldn't pick
a breast-feeding letter.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.119
Oh, no?
No,

19:24.293 --> 19:26.165
because it's a cause, and
she doesn't do causes.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.167
I'd know what kind
of letters I pick.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.081
Oh, yeah, then why are
you taking a sabbatical?

19:31.082 --> 19:33.346
[laughs quietly]

19:34.434 --> 19:35.652
Look, I'm sorry.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.437
It's just...

19:37.611 --> 19:39.526
the only reason
I took this gig

19:39.700 --> 19:41.876
is 'cause I'm a
huge fan of yours.

19:42.964 --> 19:46.185
I'm-- I mean, of your column.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.883
And I just want to do
the best job I can,
but see, the thing is,

19:49.057 --> 19:50.450
I can't really do that

19:50.624 --> 19:52.887
with you looking over my
shoulder all the time.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.105
All right?

19:56.107 --> 19:57.718
All right.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.678
All right.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.507
Would it be
cheating too much

20:04.681 --> 20:06.553
if I peeked ahead,
to see what becomes of me?

20:06.727 --> 20:08.511
Well,

20:08.685 --> 20:10.774
seeing as you're probably not
going to remember any of this,

20:10.948 --> 20:12.385
I don't see why not.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.258
PAIGE:
The closest thing I can find
is a demon who feeds off anger,

20:16.432 --> 20:18.086
but you already got him--

20:18.260 --> 20:20.088
Ow.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.221
Remember when Leo used to come
when you called him?

20:22.395 --> 20:24.310
Mm-hmm.

20:24.484 --> 20:28.227
It says here your Lord Dyson
mysteriously disappeared

20:28.401 --> 20:30.141
the day you rode
through town.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.448
Well, I doubt that's
just a coincidence.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.884
And the tax
was repealed,

20:34.058 --> 20:37.932
which means I
accomplished my goal.

20:38.106 --> 20:41.327
No offense, lady, but, um,
you drop your trousers,

20:41.501 --> 20:44.634
liberation for all, and
suddenly, your demon vanishes

20:44.808 --> 20:47.376
off the face of the earth
for all of eternity?

20:47.550 --> 20:48.725
Isn't that a
little far-fetched?

20:48.899 --> 20:50.161
PAIGE:
No.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.686
Not if the demon feeds
off of repressions.

20:52.860 --> 20:56.690
Maybe that's
how he gains his strength.

20:56.864 --> 20:59.997
Well, then, that would make
the reverse true, as well.

21:00.171 --> 21:03.479
Your ride starved
him into oblivion.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.612
[orbing]

21:08.876 --> 21:11.748
Please tell me
you weren't vanquishing demons

21:11.922 --> 21:13.272
with the children.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.099
Well, Chris was fussy,

21:15.274 --> 21:17.101
It... it calmed him.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.103
[laughing]:
Oh, really.

21:21.497 --> 21:22.542
Is that Lady...

21:22.716 --> 21:23.978
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.893
A little healing,
a little healing.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.507
And then we need
you to find out

21:31.681 --> 21:34.031
what they know about some
sort of repressor demon.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.120
You want me
to go up there?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.949
Don't worry, I'll get the
Elfin nanny to watch the kids.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.951
That's not what
I was worried about.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.214
Uh, hello, heal,
ouch, hurt.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.215
Focus.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.478
I think it wouldn't hurt

21:45.652 --> 21:46.957
to have a little
chat with the Elders

21:47.131 --> 21:50.700
to see what they think about...
the demon.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.354
W-What if they know about...

21:52.528 --> 21:55.488
I think if they knew,
we would know by now.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.055
Are they talking
about Lord Dyson?

21:58.229 --> 22:00.884
No, they're talking about
something that Leo did

22:01.058 --> 22:02.886
that they don't want
me to know about.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.410
Just go.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.065
Let's find out what we can
about this repressor demon

22:08.239 --> 22:10.154
before it starts to feed off
ourrepressions.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.330
Shall we?

22:18.206 --> 22:22.428
So, this is the land
of the free, hey?

22:22.602 --> 22:23.603
[indistinct shouting]

22:23.777 --> 22:25.039
Hey, hey sorry.

22:25.213 --> 22:26.519
Read the sign.Oh, infuriating, isn't it?

22:26.693 --> 22:28.782
Well, don't hold back, hmm?

22:28.956 --> 22:30.131
Let it out.

22:30.305 --> 22:32.612
Sorry. You got...
you got to go.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.484
[laughing, loud shouting
in background]

22:35.658 --> 22:38.139
Oh, such a plethora of
repression, it's hard to choose.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.054
Who's next?

22:40.228 --> 22:41.490
Who's next?

22:41.664 --> 22:42.752
WOMAN:
I want my car.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.928
MAN:
I want my money.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.584
[shouting]

22:48.758 --> 22:51.282
Oh, I lovethis century!

22:51.457 --> 22:54.938
[sirens wailing,
tires squealing]

22:56.766 --> 22:58.420
[women screaming]

22:58.594 --> 22:59.900
[laughing]

23:00.074 --> 23:02.032
[people yelling
and shouting]

23:02.206 --> 23:04.165
More! I need more!

23:04.339 --> 23:06.602
Come on.
Who's still out there

23:06.776 --> 23:08.604
holding it in?!

23:23.663 --> 23:26.622
Sorry to have
kept you waiting.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.929
Why do we have to meet here?

23:29.103 --> 23:30.974
Why couldn't we meet up there?

23:31.148 --> 23:32.585
You didn't hear?

23:32.759 --> 23:34.935
An Elder's gone missing, Leo.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.589
Perhaps killed.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.419
We can't be too careful.

23:40.593 --> 23:41.942
You think I did it?

23:42.116 --> 23:43.987
You killed Gideon.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.641
He tried to kill my son.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.513
I was protecting my family.

23:47.687 --> 23:48.949
We understand.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.212
But this is different.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.954
The Elder was Zola, Leo.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.217
And we understand

23:56.391 --> 23:59.829
that he was trying to reach out
to you when he disappeared.

24:03.398 --> 24:04.921
We are your family, Leo.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.619
You are one of us!

24:06.793 --> 24:09.360
I don't know that
I am anymore.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.841
Everything's changed.

24:12.015 --> 24:14.888
Just because
of what Gideon did?

24:15.062 --> 24:17.891
Leo, good is not perfect.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.676
Sometimes it messes up,

24:20.850 --> 24:23.070
but that doesn't mean
it isn't still good.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.767
And we are.

24:24.941 --> 24:25.899
Are we?

24:26.073 --> 24:27.509
Listen to me, Leo.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.512
We have sensed a great
and new threat gathering,

24:30.686 --> 24:33.341
one which will take everything
we've got to fight.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.995
And we need you for that.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.736
We're gonna need everyone.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.868
You know
what I need?

24:39.042 --> 24:40.696
I need information
on our demon

24:40.870 --> 24:43.133
that feeds
on repression.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.962
Can you help me
out or not?

24:46.136 --> 24:48.225
I'll see
what I can do.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.793
Think about what I've said.

24:57.757 --> 24:58.975
[sighs]

24:59.149 --> 25:00.934
CREATURE:
You can't trust her...

25:01.108 --> 25:02.326
[echoing]:
can't trust her.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.937
You can't trust any of them

25:04.111 --> 25:05.068
[echoing]:
anymore...
anymore...

25:05.242 --> 25:06.505
...anymore.

25:06.679 --> 25:09.116
[thunder cracks]

25:09.290 --> 25:12.162
Why are you doing this to me?

25:12.336 --> 25:14.991
Who are you?!

25:18.778 --> 25:20.519
I can't believe

25:20.693 --> 25:22.477
how empty this place
is without students.

25:22.651 --> 25:25.349
Yeah, well, I'm hoping
you'll find a way to save it,

25:25.524 --> 25:27.917
after all this, especially
for your nephews' sake.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.702
Thanks.
No pressure.
Nope.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.312
Ready to summon?

25:31.486 --> 25:32.922
Yup, all ready to go.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.490
I still think we
should wait for
Leo and find out

25:35.664 --> 25:36.926
what he knows
about the demon.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.667
No, it doesn't matter.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.756
After we send him back,
history will take care of them

25:40.930 --> 25:42.453
as long as you
finish your ride.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.325
Promise.

25:44.499 --> 25:47.241
And thank you for giving me
a glimpse of what's to come.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.025
Thank you
for showing us

25:49.199 --> 25:50.636
you're more than a box
of chocolates.

25:50.810 --> 25:51.985
I'm sorry?

25:52.159 --> 25:53.856
Mm, never mind.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.466
Okay, here we go.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.772
"We look

25:56.946 --> 25:58.600
"to find the evil set free,

25:58.774 --> 26:01.255
bring this demon
before us three."

26:01.429 --> 26:04.737
PIPER:
Hi, there.

26:05.781 --> 26:07.653
[soft grunting]

26:07.827 --> 26:09.045
Uh, why
didn't he explode?

26:09.219 --> 26:10.177
Chanting,
chanting.
Uh...

26:10.351 --> 26:11.831
PAIGE:
Okay, okay, okay!

26:12.005 --> 26:13.833
"From lands afar,
in time and space,

26:14.007 --> 26:15.486
"take them now from this

26:15.661 --> 26:17.140
"our place to that dwell,

26:17.314 --> 26:20.448
some must remain, send them back
to their domain!"

26:25.758 --> 26:27.934
PAIGE:
It worked!

26:30.676 --> 26:34.462
PAIGE:
Uh-oh. That's not good.

26:36.420 --> 26:37.900
Well, at least they're gone.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.685
Great.

26:39.859 --> 26:42.601
Will you guys drop me off
at the office on your orb home?

26:42.775 --> 26:43.950
I thought you weren't looking

26:44.124 --> 26:45.821
over Leslie's shoulders
anymore.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.301
Well, I'm not,

26:47.475 --> 26:50.043
but first I have to get him
to pick my letter.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.741
Orbing!

26:55.048 --> 26:56.223
Okay, thanks.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.399
Meet you guys at home.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.928
Looks like
everyone took

27:06.102 --> 27:08.104
Elise's sexual
harassment memo
literally.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.366
LESLIE:
Phoebe?

27:09.540 --> 27:10.759
What are you doing here?

27:11.934 --> 27:13.632
And what are you wearing?

27:13.806 --> 27:15.634
Who... Who's watching
our children?!

27:15.808 --> 27:17.548
Why aren't you at
home with them?!

27:17.723 --> 27:18.854
Excuse me?

27:19.028 --> 27:20.595
Come on.

27:22.249 --> 27:25.426
Okay. What the
hell is going on?!

27:25.600 --> 27:27.558
I think I know.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.650
PAIGE:
Oh, I told you we should
have waited for Leo.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.434
Shut up!

27:37.351 --> 27:39.353
PAIGE:
It's not so bad,
if you like gray.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.964
PIPER:
I don't understand how
everything changed so much.

27:42.138 --> 27:45.402
PAIGE:
Well, we sent the demon back
stronger than when he came.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.013
Strong enough
to kill Lady Godiva.

27:47.187 --> 27:48.536
PHOEBE:
Still, it's
hard to believe

27:48.710 --> 27:50.233
her ride affected
just everything.

27:50.407 --> 27:51.670
Look at this.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.628
Apparently, it had
an impact on us women

27:53.802 --> 27:56.500
because it sent us back,
like, 1,000 years or so.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.415
We have to
fix this.

27:58.589 --> 28:01.114
Oh, no! I left Wyatt and Chris
with the Elfin nanny before...

28:01.288 --> 28:02.419
PHOEBE:
That's okay.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.421
They're boys.

28:04.595 --> 28:05.596
They're probably
being treated like
royalty right now.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.860
Hey, why didn't
we change?

28:08.034 --> 28:11.037
Probably 'cause we were
at Magic School and protected?

they're doing?

Okay. Guys, uh, I think

28:20.133 --> 28:21.874
we're attracting a little
too much attention out here.

28:22.048 --> 28:24.006
What say we orb back
to the Book of Shadows?

28:24.180 --> 28:25.704
No, I don't want
to go back home.

28:25.878 --> 28:26.922
Why?

28:27.096 --> 28:29.142
Did you hear
what Leslie said?

28:29.316 --> 28:30.752
Well, we can't stay
out here.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.493
We're attracting
too much attention!

28:32.667 --> 28:35.278
Yeah, and we wouldn't want
to be flogged.

Every peep out of you

28:52.208 --> 28:54.558
adds an extra flogging
to your sentence.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.866
What is flogging
exactly?

28:58.040 --> 29:00.216
I don't know, but how about
we orb out of here

29:00.390 --> 29:02.262
so that we don't have
to find out?

29:02.436 --> 29:03.654
Where are we
gonna go?

We still have
to fix this somehow.

29:08.268 --> 29:09.486
Okay.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.619
Look, we need
to figure out something,

29:11.793 --> 29:13.926
'cause I need
to feed someone soon.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.928
What if Lady Godiva
is still alive?

PHOEBE:
Oh, Paige, I know
you're upset-- we all are--

29:18.147 --> 29:19.801
but we can't bring
her back to life.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.672
No, no, no. Why can't
we conjure her?

29:21.847 --> 29:23.065
That way,
she'd still be alive,

29:23.239 --> 29:25.111
and her ride would
still be ahead of her.

29:25.285 --> 29:26.503

I don't know how

29:26.677 --> 29:28.854
that's gonna get us back
to our world.

29:29.028 --> 29:30.856
Well, maybe it will,
if she can finish her ride.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.683
We'd have to vanquish the
demon first, this time.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.685
PAIGE:
We can do that. We just
have to get out of here.

29:34.860 --> 29:35.904
Leo!

29:36.078 --> 29:37.079
Oh. What if
he's different

29:37.253 --> 29:38.602

29:38.777 --> 29:42.432
That's a mighty fine question.

29:42.606 --> 29:44.347
[whispers loudly]:
Leo!

29:44.521 --> 29:45.740
What are you guys doing here?

29:45.914 --> 29:47.350
What are you wearing?

29:47.524 --> 29:49.439
PIPER:
Uh, look, we're kind
of in a hurry,

29:49.613 --> 29:51.311
so Cliff Notesversion:

29:51.485 --> 29:53.226
Demon killed Lady Godiva,

29:53.400 --> 29:55.489
we changed history,
we got to fix it.

29:55.663 --> 29:57.230
So, are you with
me or what?

29:57.404 --> 29:58.535
Lady Godiva?

29:58.709 --> 30:00.102
Ugh!
PHOEBE:
Yeah.

30:00.276 --> 30:02.061
She probably doesn't
mean much to you,

30:02.235 --> 30:04.150
but apparently, she
means a lot to us.

30:04.324 --> 30:05.542
Duncan!

30:05.716 --> 30:07.588
We're gonna need Duncan
to conjure her.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.720
Leo, can you take me
to Magic School?

30:09.895 --> 30:11.810
Magic School? Magic School's
been shut for years.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.769
Uh, everyone's in hiding
here, even demons.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.379
No one dare uses magic.

30:16.553 --> 30:17.685
Talk about repressed.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.469
Okay, but magic
still exists,

30:19.643 --> 30:22.472
which means this kid Duncan
has to be somewhere, right?

30:26.085 --> 30:28.739
[loud chatter and cheering]

30:30.263 --> 30:33.222
They got no place else to go.

30:33.396 --> 30:34.484
[indistinct chatter]

30:34.658 --> 30:36.399
Keep them here
for their own safety.

30:38.271 --> 30:40.273
Okay, go back to
Phoebe and Piper.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.275
Help them find
the history book.

30:42.449 --> 30:43.842
We're gonna need it.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.235
Don't ask. It'll just
give you a headache.

30:48.455 --> 30:49.760
Duncan?

30:49.935 --> 30:53.025
Nobody by that name here.

30:53.199 --> 30:55.157
Oh, yeah, well, I don't
have time to play games.

30:55.331 --> 30:56.680
Yeah, neither do I,

30:56.855 --> 30:58.030
so if you're thinking of
jacking my stash, don't!

30:59.596 --> 31:01.076
Murdock root.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.599
This is your stash?

31:04.427 --> 31:06.777
Look, lady, I'm warning you--
back off, understand?

31:09.650 --> 31:11.130
You're one of them
Freedom Fighters?

31:11.304 --> 31:12.609
I don't know about that,

31:12.783 --> 31:14.916
but I would like
to free you from this, uh,

31:15.090 --> 31:16.483
life you've got going here.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.528
I just need a conjuring spell.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.269
Are you trying to
get me hanged?

31:20.443 --> 31:22.184
Just 'cause these
guys are getting away

31:22.358 --> 31:24.491
with some piss-ass magic doesn't
mean we're not being watched!

31:24.665 --> 31:27.276
Look, I come from a world
where good magic isn't wasted,

31:27.450 --> 31:29.539
and it can be that way again.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.019
I just need
your conjuring spell!

31:31.193 --> 31:32.586
You are one of the do-gooders.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.066
They're always spewing
that crap.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.112
No, thisis crap, okay?

31:37.286 --> 31:39.071
Because I know you have dreams,

31:39.245 --> 31:41.160
and I know you have hopes, and
you're just suppressing them.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.639
Oh, you think I'm
scared of my dreams, don't you?

31:42.813 --> 31:43.640
No, 'cause I'm not!

31:43.814 --> 31:45.773
You have a choice.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.254
You can either step up
and be a man,

31:48.428 --> 31:50.430
or you can crawl back
in your little rat hole.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.912
It's up to you.

32:05.271 --> 32:07.621
No Joan of Arc,
no Catherine the Great...

32:07.795 --> 32:09.231
None of them are in here.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.668
Keep looking.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.192
It's pretty amazing

32:13.366 --> 32:15.542
that this world
is so much more repressed,

32:15.716 --> 32:17.544
and yet, Leo seems freer.

32:17.718 --> 32:20.068
Yeah, l almost forgot
what he was like.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.247
Okay, I got the spell.

32:25.421 --> 32:26.770
Did you find Godiva?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.773
Yep, right here-- but talk
about your fine print.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.080
It doesn't matter,
as long as she's in there.

32:32.254 --> 32:33.908
LEO:
So, wait, I
don't understand.

32:34.082 --> 32:36.955
If you return her back
to just before she was killed,

32:37.129 --> 32:39.522
history will reverse itself?

32:39.696 --> 32:40.959
Wonder about
the headache thing, right?

32:41.133 --> 32:43.309
Okay, so as soon
as we get them here,

32:43.483 --> 32:45.659
you blast Dyson, then
we send her back right away.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.878
I thought we had
to send them back together.

32:48.053 --> 32:50.272
I'm hoping no, not if Dyson
doesn't exist any more.

32:50.446 --> 32:53.101
But first, we got
to make sure we're okay.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.973
There's no buried resentments

32:55.147 --> 32:58.106
that a hungry demon
could feed off of? Phoebe?

32:58.280 --> 32:59.716
No, I'm fine.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.718
As long as Leslie's not
in the room, I'm fine. You?

33:01.892 --> 33:03.459
No, I'm good.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.113
I pretty much tell you guys
when I'm pissed off.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.463
That's a good point.
Paige?

33:07.637 --> 33:09.944
Sometimes I feel repressed
being the little sister.

33:10.118 --> 33:12.381
What, you want
to be the oldest sister?

33:12.555 --> 33:14.122
Come on now, get over it!

33:14.296 --> 33:15.558
Okay, I'm over it.

33:15.732 --> 33:18.997
"Where royals once
lived, so did she.

33:19.171 --> 33:23.088
Bring forth the naked lady
from the eleventh century."

33:36.362 --> 33:38.103
That's more like it.

33:39.365 --> 33:40.496
Paige...

33:40.670 --> 33:41.758
I thought you were
sending me back.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.195
Change of plans.

33:43.369 --> 33:46.763
Perhaps I need
a little more power.

33:47.764 --> 33:49.201
Okay.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.596
Nice try.

33:56.730 --> 33:57.948
Piper...

33:59.341 --> 34:01.604
So much bottled-up anger.

34:04.868 --> 34:05.913
You know what?

34:06.087 --> 34:07.915
Enough with
your moping.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.090
The Elders screwed you?!

34:09.264 --> 34:10.744
What about me?

34:10.918 --> 34:12.485
PHOEBE:
Uh, Piper, what
are you doing?

34:12.659 --> 34:14.965
I am not gonna raise
two little boys all on my own

34:15.140 --> 34:17.707
because you're too busy
feeling sorry for yourself!

34:17.881 --> 34:19.100
All right?

34:19.274 --> 34:21.102
So get over it!
Seriously!

34:21.276 --> 34:22.582
DYSON:
Now, where was I?

34:24.671 --> 34:25.933
Energy ball!

34:27.935 --> 34:28.631
Ooh, that's not good.

34:28.805 --> 34:30.155
Piper, enough!

34:32.200 --> 34:33.419
LEO:
Stop...

34:33.593 --> 34:35.247
Okay, you get Piper,
I'll get him.

34:37.510 --> 34:38.337
Yah!

34:38.511 --> 34:40.382
LEO:
Stop! Piper!

34:40.556 --> 34:42.254
Piper, snap out of it.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.734
It's the demon
doing this to you, not Leo.

34:44.908 --> 34:45.909
[Phoebe whimpers]

34:46.736 --> 34:48.086
[gasps]PIPER:
No!

34:52.438 --> 34:54.440
PHOEBE:
Piper...

34:59.053 --> 35:01.273
How am I supposed to
know I was so repressed?

35:01.447 --> 35:03.144
You couldn't tell?

35:03.318 --> 35:05.494
I'm a working single mother
of two kids-- I barely have time

35:05.668 --> 35:07.279
to brush my teeth,
let alone self-reflection.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.368
Well, maybe you
should make time.

35:09.542 --> 35:12.458
Nothing that needed healing,
she's just a little shaken up.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.112
I bet she is.

35:14.286 --> 35:15.983
Well, guys, we better
come up with a plan,

35:16.157 --> 35:18.464
because Lord Dyson is out there
getting stronger as we speak.

35:18.638 --> 35:19.508
Thanks to Piper.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.467
All right!

35:21.641 --> 35:23.904
Look, all we're saying is
that when he comes back...And he will.

35:24.078 --> 35:26.080
PAIGE:
...he might be too
strong to stop,

35:26.254 --> 35:28.865
especially if he taps
into Leo's repressed rage.

35:29.039 --> 35:31.999
I'm not going to be able
to finish my ride, am I?

35:33.479 --> 35:35.133
No, you're not.

35:43.402 --> 35:44.403
[chuckling]

35:44.577 --> 35:45.708
Orb her out of here.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.362
PAIGE:
No.

35:47.536 --> 35:48.798
She won't stand a chance.
He'll feed off Leo.

35:54.587 --> 35:55.979
Just get her out of here.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.155
We'll think of something.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.159
We'll think of something?
That's the best you can do?

36:05.902 --> 36:07.904
[grunting]

36:10.603 --> 36:13.606
I'm officially open
to other ideas.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.782
Okay, maybe we should
let him get to Leo.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.000
Maybe he'll overdose.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.437
Or become unstoppable.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.221
He already is that.

36:20.395 --> 36:22.571
Okay, I am orbing
you guys out of here.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.573
No, actually you're gonna
let him feed on you.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.271
See ya.Good luck, man.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.273
What?

36:28.447 --> 36:30.449
Let's see what you've
been hiding from me.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.755
DYSON:
Oh, there's so much,

36:32.929 --> 36:34.844
so ready to come out.

36:35.018 --> 36:36.019
Oh, let it out.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.239
Let it all out.

36:38.413 --> 36:39.240
You demons

36:39.414 --> 36:41.764
have it so easy.

36:41.938 --> 36:43.853
No morality to worry about...

36:45.725 --> 36:47.030
...no attachments,

36:47.205 --> 36:48.206
no one to lose.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.555
Yeah, you tell
him, Leo.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.949
When you kill, you feel nothing!

36:53.123 --> 36:55.474
[screaming]

36:55.952 --> 36:56.649
Whoo!

37:13.535 --> 37:15.842
How you doing?

37:16.016 --> 37:18.758
Feels good to get rid
of all that stuff, huh?

37:19.846 --> 37:20.934
[sighs]

37:21.108 --> 37:22.370
You did it-- you
vanquished him.

37:22.544 --> 37:23.980
Thanks to Leo.

37:24.154 --> 37:25.417
[sighs]

37:25.591 --> 37:27.767
Finally, I'm free!

37:27.941 --> 37:30.944
Yes, you are.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.488
Me? Why don't you
send her back?

37:53.662 --> 37:55.751
I don't want to
use magic anymore.

37:55.925 --> 37:57.536
You can't stop
using your magic

37:57.710 --> 37:59.233
any more than you can
stop breathing, Duncan.

37:59.407 --> 38:01.931
Well, I don't want to
be that way anymore.

38:02.105 --> 38:04.064
You don't have a choice;
none of us do.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.936
Look, you messed up--
big deal.

38:07.110 --> 38:08.547
That's what you're here for--

38:08.721 --> 38:10.505
to learn, to gain control
over your powers.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.159
You have to show
that you can

38:12.333 --> 38:14.422
fix this, for all our sakes.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.381
What if they're watching?

38:16.555 --> 38:18.992
I hope they're watching.

38:19.166 --> 38:20.428
You can do this.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.566
So, uh,

38:27.740 --> 38:30.003
you ready to go back?

38:30.177 --> 38:33.659
I can't wait.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.707
Duncan, the spell?

38:38.881 --> 38:39.839
Oh.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.057
Right. Right.

38:41.231 --> 38:42.755
Um...

38:42.929 --> 38:45.235
"A time for everything
and everything in place,

38:45.410 --> 38:47.673
return what's been moved
through time and space."

38:55.855 --> 38:57.596
I knew you
could do it.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.555
I got this one.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.775
You can't help yourself,
can you, Paige?

39:04.124 --> 39:05.255
You just can't leave
well enough alone.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.128
If "well enough alone"

39:08.302 --> 39:10.043
means shutting down
Magic School, then no.

39:10.217 --> 39:11.523
Then no, I can't.

39:11.697 --> 39:13.699
If you don't give
these amazing kids

39:13.873 --> 39:15.962
a place to go
and express themselves,

39:16.136 --> 39:17.833
then you are going to be
crushing their spirits

39:18.007 --> 39:19.748
and relegating them
to hiding in caves

39:19.922 --> 39:21.881
and alleyways and abusing magic,

39:22.055 --> 39:23.317
because they have
nowhere else to turn.

39:23.491 --> 39:25.450
I think you've made your point.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.060
So...

39:27.234 --> 39:28.888
So...

39:30.280 --> 39:31.891
...we won't shut it down.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.762
What?!

39:33.936 --> 39:35.895
As long as you can prove
that you can keep running it.

39:36.069 --> 39:38.245
Me?!

39:38.419 --> 39:40.465
Oh, no, no, not-- no.
[chuckles]

39:40.639 --> 39:43.250
No, I'll find
someone.

39:46.993 --> 39:48.951
You can do this.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.127
[people chattering]

39:58.918 --> 40:00.485
Hey, this better
be good.

40:00.659 --> 40:03.401
I was just in the middle of
putting Wyatt down for a nap.

40:03.575 --> 40:05.794
Yeah, it looks
like Lady Godiva

40:05.968 --> 40:08.406
has quite an impact
on our Phoebe's cause.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.408
Oh, my goodness.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.476
Excuse me.

40:35.650 --> 40:38.784
This man is still living
in the eleventh century.

40:38.958 --> 40:40.829
He wants women
to be barefoot

40:41.003 --> 40:43.266
and pregnant and stay at home.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.616
[crowd booing]

40:44.790 --> 40:45.878
He thinks we should
be ashamedUh-uh.

40:46.052 --> 40:47.662
of breast-feeding--

40:47.836 --> 40:49.664
the most natural thing
in the world.

40:49.838 --> 40:52.667
Well, shame on him.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.061
I'm not ashamed,
and neither should you be.

40:55.235 --> 40:57.150
[cheering and applause]

40:57.324 --> 40:58.630
That's right!

40:58.804 --> 41:00.196
And it's a shame that women

41:00.370 --> 41:01.328
have to take off their clothes
to be heard.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.504
We shouldn't
have to be

41:03.678 --> 41:04.853
exploited like this.

41:05.027 --> 41:05.941
Right?

41:06.115 --> 41:08.944
CROWD:
Right!

41:09.118 --> 41:11.077
Oh, no, you don't.

41:11.251 --> 41:13.732
There.
Are you satisfied now?

41:13.906 --> 41:14.733
CROWD:
Yeah!

41:14.907 --> 41:16.038
[cheering]

41:21.043 --> 41:23.002
[cheering and applause
continues]
