00:01.430 --> 00:02.294
Previously on elementary...Think just 'cause you're a cop,

00:02.330 --> 00:03.797
you ain't got to watchwhere you're going?

00:03.830 --> 00:07.334
Oh, you gotsomething for me, cop?

00:07.370 --> 00:09.235
Chantal: The guy you hit,his name is my booker.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.430
He's my ex-husband.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.074
You're gonna steerclear of her, forever.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.338
Clear?

00:13.380 --> 00:15.268
I went to see my yesterday.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.346
Asked him about the reportthat got filed against me.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.268
He put gorham up to it.No question in my mind.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.412
The whole thing's a setup.

00:21.550 --> 00:24.018
Chantal?

00:28.860 --> 00:31.021
(Heart monitor beeping steadily)

00:34.330 --> 00:35.752
Marcus.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.290
How is she?

00:37.330 --> 00:39.594
Bell:I, um...

00:39.640 --> 00:42.700
Found her lyingon the bedroom floor.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.332
Blood everywhere.

00:44.370 --> 00:47.305
First, I couldn't tellif she was breathing.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.706
There's no defensive wounds,and from the looks of it,

00:49.750 --> 00:51.843
she hit her forehead onthe bed frame going down.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.768
He was probablywaiting in the house,

00:53.820 --> 00:55.674
came at her from behind.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.688
Her nose is broken,

00:57.720 --> 00:59.813
cheekbone's broken,

00:59.860 --> 01:00.986
couple of broken ribs,skull fracture.

01:01.020 --> 01:03.625
They called her unresponsivewhen they brought her in.

01:03.660 --> 01:07.756
They did a ct scan, sawsome bleeding and fluid

01:07.800 --> 01:09.495
building up around her brain.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.498
Doc says they're gonnakeep her under heaw sedation

01:11.530 --> 01:14.135
and keep a close eye on itfor a few days.

01:14.170 --> 01:17.264
They won't really knowanything more till then.

01:17.310 --> 01:21.201
Gregson: I'm sure they're doingeverything that they can.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.344
If there's, uh,anything you need,

01:23.380 --> 01:24.608
anything,

01:24.650 --> 01:26.845
from me, paige,just say the word.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.281
Watson's with csu collectingevidence at chantal's home.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.483
So far, her assessmentmatches yours.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.817
The assailant lay in wait.

01:34.860 --> 01:37.420
He gained entry by, uh,prying open a window.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.428
It was a careful job,would've taken some time,

01:39.460 --> 01:41.792
so it's unlikelythat he would've gone undetected

01:41.830 --> 01:43.422
if she'd been home.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.199
You were there, so...

01:46.240 --> 01:48.390
I take it you're aware ofthe other incident at the scene.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.169
What other incident?

01:52.210 --> 01:55.702
Whoever did thisemptied his bladder

01:55.740 --> 01:57.241
on chantal's bed.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.578
"Whoever did this"? Really?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.713
You're talking likethere's some mystery to solve.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.149
We all knowwho did it.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.145
Roy booker did it.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.454
Marcus, let's just slow down.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.879
Why? He tried to jam me up,it blew up in his face,

02:08.920 --> 02:10.581
so he took it out on her.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.627
Let's-let's take a walk.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.134
(Vending machine whirring)

02:27.880 --> 02:29.871
(Coffee pouring)

02:38.420 --> 02:40.411
Thanks.

02:42.660 --> 02:44.924
Captain's instructed youto sit this one out.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.727
He's right.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.228
I make a mistake 'causemy head's not on straight,

02:50.270 --> 02:53.433
and i'm the reason my walks,i'd never forgive myself.

02:53.470 --> 02:56.234
Captain said to sit tight,stay here with chantal.

02:56.270 --> 02:57.532
He's also gonna keep

02:57.570 --> 03:01.609
a uni on her doorto make sure she's safe.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.278
I know how you're feeling.

03:03.310 --> 03:05.642
The woman you lovehas been hurt,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.843
and you want, with every fiberof your being, to avenge her.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.678
And yet,you're powerless to do so.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.948
In my case,i disappeared.

03:12.990 --> 03:15.788
I spiraled into self-destruction and despair.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.789
And for a long time,i was no good to anyone.

03:20.330 --> 03:23.390
If this is a pep talk,it needs work.

03:23.430 --> 03:26.331
And i'm not you.

03:26.370 --> 03:29.305
It's not a pep talk.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.535
You're right, our situationsare quite different.

03:31.570 --> 03:32.673
Unlike me,

03:32.710 --> 03:34.632
you have peoplewho care about you

03:34.680 --> 03:36.409
to find justicefor you.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.772
And I promise you, marcus,

03:39.820 --> 03:42.482
justice will be done.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.717
*

04:24.990 --> 04:27.652
do you see who his lawyer is?Ardy gulbenkian.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.928
Holmes: That's the lawyerroy was working for

04:28.960 --> 04:30.791
when he tried to get chantalpulled off a case.

04:30.830 --> 04:33.833
It's a pretty bold move,bringing that guy in for this.

04:33.870 --> 04:36.304
Perhaps he offers anabettor's discount.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.331
Gregson:Ready to go?

04:40.680 --> 04:43.899
Gulbenkian: You people are awarethat mr. Booker's a former cop?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.975
If you're expecting mr. Bookerto get special treatment

04:46.010 --> 04:49.889
because of that, let meemphasize the word "former."

04:49.920 --> 04:53.356
And let's not also forgethow he left the job.

04:53.390 --> 04:55.312
Watson: Detective bellfound out that he faked

04:55.360 --> 04:58.682
a disability claim so thathe could take an early pension.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.322
In retribution, your client

05:00.360 --> 05:02.362
got a civilian to filea false incident report,

05:02.400 --> 05:06.029
accusing detective bellof aiming a gun at him.

05:06.070 --> 05:08.061
Gregson:That ended with your clientgetting arrested yesterday.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.466
So, yeah. We're awarethat he's a former cop.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.933
We're also aware thathe has some serious anger issues

05:12.980 --> 05:16.802
with his ex-wifeand detective bell.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.000
I think that last partdepends on where you're sitting.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.608
Sounds to me likethis whole precinct's

05:20.650 --> 05:22.015
got a vendettaagainst my client.

05:22.050 --> 05:23.142
How's he supposedto get a fair shake?

05:23.190 --> 05:25.545
He shook himself quiteadequately at the crime scene.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.854
Or were you not awareof his act of defilement?

05:27.890 --> 05:30.358
Gulbenkian: I'm awaresomeone did that.

05:30.390 --> 05:31.459
It's the reasoni wanted to remind you

05:31.490 --> 05:32.889
mr. Booker used to be a cop.

05:32.930 --> 05:34.397
He'd have to have beenpretty stupid

05:34.430 --> 05:35.988
to urinate at a crime scene,don't you think?

05:36.030 --> 05:38.021
He knows how dna works.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.628
Angry people make mistakes.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.991
And I got to thinkhe was plenty angry

05:42.040 --> 05:44.838
when his attempt to jam updetective bell didn't work.

05:44.870 --> 05:46.508
I did not do this!

05:46.540 --> 05:48.098
All right? If chantalis saying I did...

05:48.140 --> 05:49.971
Watson: Chantal is not sayinganything right now.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.547
If and whenshe regains consciousness,

05:52.580 --> 05:54.810
we look forwardto speaking with her.

05:54.850 --> 05:56.989
Gregson: And one of the thingswe want to ask her

05:57.020 --> 06:00.751
is if you ever laid a handon her during your marriage.

06:02.890 --> 06:06.121
We do, what's she gonna tell us?

06:06.160 --> 06:08.651
Can you account for

06:08.700 --> 06:11.168
your whereabouts last nightbetween 6:00 and 8:00?

06:11.200 --> 06:13.464
After I was arraigned,i went to work.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.637
Which is?

06:14.670 --> 06:16.160
Last couple months,i've been working

06:16.200 --> 06:19.135
as an investigator for a firmcalled sawyer winthrop rose.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.001
They're divorce lawyers.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.008
Ardy helped me get the gig.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.006
So between 6:00 and 8:00last night,

06:25.050 --> 06:27.041
I was parked outsidethe birchwood grove country club

06:27.080 --> 06:28.172
on the island,

06:28.220 --> 06:29.642
tailing aclient's husband.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.714
Anyone see you?

06:30.750 --> 06:32.115
Not if i'm good at my job.

06:32.150 --> 06:33.651
Gregson:According to the e.R. Docs,

06:33.690 --> 06:35.089
chantal was beatenwith a short, blunt weapon,

06:35.120 --> 06:36.155
like a blackjack.

06:36.190 --> 06:38.021
We checkthe commands you worked,

06:38.060 --> 06:40.551
check your credit cards,we gonna find out you own one?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.420
No.Watson:You should also know,

06:42.470 --> 06:43.823
we spoke to a close friendof chantal's,

06:43.870 --> 06:46.191
who told us that you still havea box of old clothes

06:46.230 --> 06:47.436
in her basement.

06:47.470 --> 06:49.199
The lab is gonnacompare the dna

06:49.240 --> 06:50.901
to the samplefound at the scene.

06:50.940 --> 06:53.534
Like he said,you know how dna works.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.947
If you ever want a chanceto explain your side of things,

06:56.980 --> 06:58.709
now is the time.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.071
I already told youmy side of the story.

07:03.990 --> 07:08.757
You try to railroad me for this,you'll be sorry.

07:08.790 --> 07:11.486
You must be especially hydratedto make a threat like that.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.122
But message received.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.129
We will all put rubber sheetson our mattresses.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.866
Watson: Those two area match made in heaven.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.504
Slime defending slime.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.201
Well, at least we heardone thing of value

07:24.240 --> 07:25.798
during their performance.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.205
A country clublike the one my mentioned,

07:27.240 --> 07:28.673
they will have cameras

07:28.710 --> 07:30.507
covering all oftheir entrances and exits.

07:30.550 --> 07:31.744
So a review of the video

07:31.780 --> 07:33.577
should make quick workof shredding his alibi.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.747
Gregson: The department's dealtwith birchwood grove before.

07:35.780 --> 07:39.147
Discretion is a big partof their pitch to their members.

07:39.190 --> 07:41.750
We had a case a few yearsback where we knew

07:41.790 --> 07:44.020
the perp had hidden hismurder weapon on their grounds.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.220
Their lavwersmade the d.A. Jump

07:45.260 --> 07:48.149
through every hoop in the bookbefore we could get in there.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.929
Holmes:Wel|, i'm quite hoop-resistant.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.028
I'll pay thema visit myself and see

07:51.070 --> 07:52.025
if I can'tinduce their cooperation.

07:52.070 --> 07:54.197
While you do that,i got a text from marcus.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.162
He said he spent the nightat the hospital.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.998
He wants me to go to his placeand bring him some things.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.133
Let us know if there's any news.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.173
Hey.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.214
(Knocks softly)

08:13.620 --> 08:15.554
Marcus.

08:16.690 --> 08:18.521
Any word?

08:18.560 --> 08:21.791
Plenty of words. I just don'tknow what half of them mean.

08:21.830 --> 08:24.697
They just brought her backfrom a second ct scan.

08:24.730 --> 08:27.039
Doc said somethingabout "midline shift"

08:27.070 --> 08:29.538
and "monitoring icp,"but all I got

08:29.570 --> 08:31.299
was they still don't knowif she's gonna be all right.

08:31.340 --> 08:34.878
I heard one of them ask a nurseto "increase mannitol,"

08:34.910 --> 08:37.640
so when you walked in, I wasjust looking up what that is.

08:37.680 --> 08:41.218
Pretty sure my phone auto-corrected to "manatee," so...

08:41.250 --> 08:42.717
Mannitol is a diuretic.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.218
They use it to reduceintracranial pressure.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.683
Now maybe youshould stop

08:46.720 --> 08:48.210
surfing the webfor medical answers

08:48.260 --> 08:50.125
on your phone;It's never a good idea.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.651
I'm climbing the walls.

08:52.700 --> 08:57.023
Can't do anything here,can't help you guys out there.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.061
I hate hospitals.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.092
The machines beeping,the smells, uh...

09:02.140 --> 09:03.232
Yeah, everyone hates hospitals.

09:03.270 --> 09:04.703
No, I mean...

09:04.740 --> 09:09.677
I really hate hospitals,ever since I was a kid.

09:09.710 --> 09:15.114
When I was nine,my mom got hit by a car.

09:15.150 --> 09:18.278
She was in the hospitalfor a month.

09:18.320 --> 09:23.189
Broken bones, collapsed lung,bruises all over.

09:23.230 --> 09:27.189
That wasn't even the bad part.

09:27.230 --> 09:30.688
Eventually, they let her go,she came home.

09:30.730 --> 09:34.234
Only they'd missedthat her aorta had been damaged.

09:34.270 --> 09:37.364
Two weeks later,

09:37.410 --> 09:38.729
it ruptured.

09:38.770 --> 09:41.375
She went into emergency surgery.

09:41.410 --> 09:44.675
She almost died.

09:44.710 --> 09:49.738
And then we were back here,sitting by her bed again.

09:49.790 --> 09:53.908
I mean, not here, here,but... just like here.

09:58.930 --> 10:00.898
I have an idea.

10:00.930 --> 10:02.966
I have friendson staff here.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.399
You have a changeof clothes now.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.261
I'll see ifI can get permission

10:06.300 --> 10:08.393
for you to usetheir staff locker room.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.635
You take a shower,then you get some fresh air

10:10.670 --> 10:11.898
and get something to eat.

10:11.940 --> 10:15.171
I'll stay here with chantaltill you get back.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.671
(Elevator bell dings)

10:20.350 --> 10:22.272
Oh, hell no.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.685
Hey!

10:26.720 --> 10:29.257
What the hell's going on?!Are you insane?

10:29.290 --> 10:30.848
You think there's any wayi'm letting you get near her?

10:30.890 --> 10:32.357
Yeah, well,i want to talk to her.

10:32.390 --> 10:34.119
You probably shouldn't havetried to kill her last night!

10:34.160 --> 10:36.025
You think I don't knowwhat's going on here, detective?

10:36.060 --> 10:37.095
You did this to her.

10:37.130 --> 10:39.121
You hurt chantal!You're a psycho!

10:39.170 --> 10:40.933
Oh, yeah, and that dna matchthey found at the scene,

10:40.970 --> 10:42.198
that was a nice touch,but I was a cop,

10:42.240 --> 10:43.867
I know how this works.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.935
You call your friend at the lab,he makes the dna say

10:45.970 --> 10:47.972
whatever you want.Hey, you!

10:48.010 --> 10:50.103
You can't be here.I was just leaving.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.845
Officer:I'll walk you out.

10:54.950 --> 10:56.781
(Elevator bell dings)

11:02.020 --> 11:05.387
Maureen: I'm sorry, mr. Holmes, you must understand,

11:05.430 --> 11:07.853
birchwood grove hasa longstanding policy

11:07.900 --> 11:09.151
of confidentiality

11:09.200 --> 11:11.122
that our membersexpect us to maintain.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.762
So i've been told.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.132
And even if I came backwith a warrant,

11:15.170 --> 11:17.934
I assume you would just tiethat up by requesting a stay,

11:17.970 --> 11:21.178
probably issued by a judge whois himself a member. (Chuckles)

11:21.210 --> 11:23.007
That would be my job.Uh, I understand

11:23.050 --> 11:25.905
you give tours of your groundsto prospective applicants.

11:25.950 --> 11:27.838
After the proper vetting,of course.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.780
If you'd like tofi|| out an application,

11:29.820 --> 11:31.242
i'd be happyto show you around...

11:31.290 --> 11:33.315
I wasn't asking,i was just stating.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.816
You actually showed

11:34.860 --> 11:36.851
an acquaintance of mine aroundhalf an hour ago.

11:36.890 --> 11:39.029
He identified himselfas stephen armacost,

11:39.060 --> 11:41.119
but the credentials that youreviewed online were fake.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.025
He is, in fact, an actor.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.196
I chose him

11:44.230 --> 11:47.768
because of his resemblanceto an international fugitive

11:47.800 --> 11:49.939
named armand leroux.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.961
Ran a cocaine ring ineurope for many years.

11:52.010 --> 11:54.501
Remains one ofinterpol's most wanted.

11:54.540 --> 11:56.371
You might not knowwhat mr. Leroux looks like,

11:56.410 --> 11:57.377
but I assure you,

11:57.410 --> 11:59.878
those photographs of youshowing my friend around

11:59.920 --> 12:01.410
will have the fbiand interpol

12:01.450 --> 12:03.418
swarming yourproperty like bees.

12:03.450 --> 12:06.851
I would hate to inconvenienceyour members.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.396
Watson: Hey, didyou get my text?

12:13.430 --> 12:15.022
Police issued a warrantfor roy booker's arrest

12:15.060 --> 12:16.288
about an hour ago.

12:16.330 --> 12:17.866
His lawyer claimedthat he can't find him,

12:17.900 --> 12:19.458
so police arelooking for him.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.535
I saw.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.094
The dna was a match.

12:22.140 --> 12:25.359
The urine found onchantal's bed was roy's.

12:25.410 --> 12:28.038
I look forward tolearning how it got there.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.968
Wait, what?

12:30.010 --> 12:31.045
"How it got there"?

12:31.080 --> 12:33.014
Do I have to drawyou a picture?

12:33.050 --> 12:34.017
Don't panic,i haven't forgotten

12:34.050 --> 12:35.938
how human anatomy works.

12:35.980 --> 12:38.915
You'll understandmy query in a moment.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.458
This is surveillance footagefrom birchwood grove.

12:45.490 --> 12:48.391
Watson:That's roy.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.819
He really was outside the clubwhen he said he was.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.134
An hour's drive away at the timeof chantal's assault.

12:53.170 --> 12:56.560
He didn't do it, and yethis dna was at the scene.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.409
So you think someone'strying to frame him?

12:58.440 --> 13:00.408
(Phone ringing)

13:00.440 --> 13:02.032
It's the captain.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.877
Hey, you've got me and sherlock.

13:03.910 --> 13:06.105
Gregson: That's good. We gotto talk about my booker.

13:06.150 --> 13:07.879
As a matter of fact,we just were.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.047
We don't think he's the onewho hurt chantal.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.046
We think someone'strying to set him up.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.887
Captain,are you still there?

13:13.920 --> 13:17.128
Yeah. And if you thinkwhat happened was a frame job,

13:17.160 --> 13:18.957
I want to hear all about it.

13:18.990 --> 13:20.127
Thing is,

13:20.160 --> 13:21.991
it's not gonna do my much good.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.895
We just found him.

13:23.930 --> 13:25.261
He shot himself.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.995
He's dead.

13:38.550 --> 13:41.041
I don't buy it.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.911
Roy wasn't the typeto kill himself.

13:42.950 --> 13:46.181
You saw how he wassinking his teeth into me.

13:46.220 --> 13:48.484
We already know.Somebody killed him.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.385
At first,a|| the forensics

13:50.430 --> 13:52.057
lined up behind suicide.

13:52.090 --> 13:54.593
There was gsr on roy's hand.There was no sign of a struggle.

13:54.630 --> 13:56.962
We thought maybe he did it'cause of all the heat

13:57.000 --> 13:58.160
that was coming down on him.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.533
He was already awaiting trialon the conspiracy charge.

14:01.570 --> 14:05.131
And now he was beingframed for assault.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.569
Watson: He had to knowthat prison time was

14:06.610 --> 14:08.100
a real possibility.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.347
It's bad enough as a criminal,but as an ex-cop?

14:10.380 --> 14:13.213
Then he said the same thingyou just said--

14:13.250 --> 14:15.514
roy wouldn't havekilled himself.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.484
There was a receipt for petrolin his pocket

14:17.520 --> 14:19.317
from an hour beforehis death, roughly.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.614
It's possible that he wasplanning to flee new york

14:21.660 --> 14:24.151
before a suddenchange of heart,

14:24.190 --> 14:25.987
but topping off your tankbefore topping yourself

14:26.030 --> 14:27.327
seemed odd enough

14:27.360 --> 14:29.089
to supportmy suspicions.

14:29.130 --> 14:31.223
Watson: So we askedhawes for a tox screen.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.398
Roy was roofiedshortly before he died.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.896
Someone drugged him,

14:35.940 --> 14:36.964
and then shot him when he was unconscious.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.138
Says here there were alsotrace amounts of thc.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.636
We think that'sunrelated.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.376
At those levels, he hadn'tused marijuana in weeks.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.378
It surprised me, too.He didn't seem the type.

14:46.410 --> 14:50.210
Yeah, well, maybe lifeas a serial dirtbag

14:50.250 --> 14:52.115
was stressing him out.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.226
You guys know I was atthe hospital all night, right?

14:57.260 --> 14:59.478
If you think we brought you hereto accuse you of something,

14:59.530 --> 15:01.259
you obviously didn'tget any sleep.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.689
I'm just saying,if I was investigating this,

15:03.730 --> 15:05.163
i'd look at me first.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.498
I went at royat the hospital yesterday.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.202
Yeah, well, you're notinvestigating-- we are.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.662
And we aren't idiots.

15:16.740 --> 15:20.517
You think whoever did this isthe same guy who hurt chantal?

15:20.550 --> 15:22.541
It's a virtual certainty.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.447
Gregson: Csu found a bloodyblackjack in roy's trunk.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.685
We're expecting,when the blood comes back,

15:27.720 --> 15:29.187
it'll be chantal's.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.053
And since wealready know that

15:32.090 --> 15:33.227
roy was being framed,

15:33.260 --> 15:34.989
the only wayit could've got there...

15:35.030 --> 15:38.227
Is if the framer planted it.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.066
Hey.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.331
We're gonna getthis guy for you.

15:42.370 --> 15:44.201
You know that, right?

15:51.110 --> 15:54.079
Before I go, you two havea sense of your next move?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.338
We do. The personthat we're looking for

15:56.380 --> 15:58.348
assaulted chantalbut murdered roy.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.608
That's a strong indicationthat this is all about him.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.218
Watson: We thinkthe person responsible

16:02.260 --> 16:03.682
is trying to tellpolice a story.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.324
Roy was out of control,he beat up his ex-wife.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.328
When the hammer came down,he killed himself.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.499
You're gonna find outif he had any enemies.

16:10.530 --> 16:13.067
Between his winning personalityand his work as a snoop

16:13.100 --> 16:14.692
for a law firm whichspecialized in divorce,

16:14.740 --> 16:16.367
hard to imagine he didn't.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.607
Yesterday, he told usthat he was tailing the husband

16:18.640 --> 16:20.369
of one of the firm's clients.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.207
Maybe that husbanddidn't like being tailed.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.548
Sherlock: As atheory of the crime,

16:23.580 --> 16:25.400
it would have one pointworking in its favor.

16:25.450 --> 16:28.317
It could explain how the killergot their hands on roy's urine.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.215
Roy's work entailedlong hours

16:30.250 --> 16:31.182
in his car.

16:31.220 --> 16:33.085
He wouldn't be the firstprivate investigator

16:33.120 --> 16:36.283
to relieve himself in a bottleto avoid leaving his post.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.356
Okay, but that would meanthe guy didn't just make roy,

16:38.390 --> 16:41.052
he managed to get a bottlelike that out of roy's car.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.590
Now that roy's death

16:42.630 --> 16:45.269
is looking like a homicide,csu is going over the car again.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.460
I'm gonna join them.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.094
If there's any indicationthat someone broke in recently,

16:49.140 --> 16:50.459
I will call you guys.

16:52.510 --> 16:53.704
I'm guessing you're headed over

16:53.740 --> 16:56.129
to the law firmroy was working for,

16:56.180 --> 16:57.408
find outwho he was tailing.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.576
You guess wrong.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.475
My plan is thatwe go there together.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.772
You heard the captain,i'm still on the bench.

17:02.820 --> 17:04.447
Officially, yes.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.515
But watson described thestate she found you in

17:06.550 --> 17:07.414
at the hospital.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.189
I think you need toengage in some work.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.551
Sooner the better.

17:10.590 --> 17:13.491
I won't tell if you won't.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.690
(Phone ringing)

17:17.730 --> 17:20.369
Roy reported to one ofthe partners, ted winthrop.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.437
They're letting him knowwe want to talk to him.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.837
Law firm ofsavwer winthrop rose.

17:26.870 --> 17:29.577
"Specializing inhidden-asset investigation."

17:29.610 --> 17:33.171
Divorcing spouse hideshis or her money from the other

17:33.220 --> 17:35.745
through a byzantine mazeof offshore accounts

17:35.780 --> 17:38.248
and shell companies,and the other one hires

17:38.290 --> 17:40.679
a team like this to hacktheir way through that maze.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.415
Sounds more like a jobfor accountants

17:42.460 --> 17:43.825
than a guy like roy.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.385
Yes, it is.

17:46.430 --> 17:47.727
But, occasionally,it does require

17:47.760 --> 17:49.421
good old-fashioned legwork.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.293
Tailing spouses to seewho they meet, for example.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.639
Perhaps installing malwareand keyloggers

17:54.670 --> 17:56.638
on their computers and phones.

17:56.670 --> 18:00.333
That definitely soundsmore up roy's alley.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.547
You seemed disappointedin the captain's office earlier,

18:05.580 --> 18:08.549
when we told youabout roy.

18:08.580 --> 18:10.514
Might not have beenmy finest moment,

18:10.550 --> 18:15.351
but my first thought wheni heard he shot himself was...

18:15.390 --> 18:16.482
"Good."

18:16.520 --> 18:19.626
Couldn't happento a nicer guy.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.527
Then you said it was a setup.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.222
That means that whoever hurtchantal is still out there,

18:25.270 --> 18:28.194
so of course i'm disappointed.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.606
No, I didn't mean that.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.665
In fact,i detected the opposite

18:32.710 --> 18:34.769
when you found out chantal'sattacker was still at large.

18:34.810 --> 18:36.175
You seemed invigorated.

18:38.610 --> 18:41.579
I meant when you found outthat roy was dead,

18:41.620 --> 18:44.885
you seemed disappointedthat you didn't get to hurt him.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.559
(Door opens)

18:47.590 --> 18:49.649
Woman: Mr. Winthropwill see you now.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.694
My god.

18:54.730 --> 18:57.665
Roy was only with usa few months,

18:57.700 --> 18:59.793
but he seemed like a good guy.

18:59.830 --> 19:02.230
You just needed more timeto get to know him.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.737
Sorry?

19:03.770 --> 19:04.600
Roy told my colleaguesyesterday

19:04.640 --> 19:06.631
that he'd beenfollowing the husband

19:06.670 --> 19:07.739
of one of your clients.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.509
We'd like that man's name.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.701
Why? You think he hadsomething to do with this?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.718
It's a possibilithe're exploring.

19:13.750 --> 19:14.842
Given the work you do here

19:14.880 --> 19:16.848
and the kind of clientsyou do it for,

19:16.880 --> 19:18.484
that man may have been hiding

19:18.520 --> 19:19.544
millions from his wife.

19:19.590 --> 19:20.955
Having an investigatorfollow him

19:20.990 --> 19:23.379
would have posed a threatto his assets.

19:24.760 --> 19:25.954
Perhaps you thinkwe'd be better served

19:25.990 --> 19:28.857
looking at someone else yourfirm asked my to investigate.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.561
No, it's not that.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.763
It's just, this puts mein an interesting spot.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.290
How's that?

19:37.370 --> 19:39.361
So as not to beataround the bush,

19:39.410 --> 19:42.675
roy was following a mannamed fyodor ukhov.

19:42.710 --> 19:45.406
I'm representing his wifelara in their divorce.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.714
There are issuesof attorney-client privilege

19:47.750 --> 19:49.570
I have to consider.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.986
But obviously you'd liketo be able to tell us more.

19:52.020 --> 19:54.784
Well, of courseyou would.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.708
What better for your clientthan to have her husband

19:56.760 --> 19:58.751
suddenly embroiledin a murder investigation?

19:58.790 --> 20:00.826
We've already told youthat his hidden money

20:00.860 --> 20:02.748
could have provided motive.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.768
All of a sudden,the district attorney's office

20:04.800 --> 20:06.791
will be issuing subpoenasfor you.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.958
Telling you who I representisn't protected by privilege.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.764
You could have found thatin a court filing.

20:12.810 --> 20:16.007
But beyond that,you go down a road

20:16.040 --> 20:17.849
off somethingi shouldn't have said,

20:17.880 --> 20:19.575
your evidence couldget thrown out.

20:19.610 --> 20:22.317
Something I say comes backto bite my client,

20:22.350 --> 20:25.444
then i'm the one getting sued.

20:25.490 --> 20:28.687
However, I can't be held liable

20:28.720 --> 20:30.779
for anything you find

20:30.830 --> 20:32.980
on your own in the press.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.992
And there's been a lotabout these two

20:37.030 --> 20:38.918
in the press.

20:47.710 --> 20:51.749
"Turbulence builds asukhov marriage nosedives."

20:53.520 --> 20:55.613
He's a private jet broker, so...

20:58.850 --> 21:01.887
Well, this article allegesthat he's sheltering $20 million

21:01.920 --> 21:04.855
from his wife and federal taxes.

21:06.990 --> 21:08.389
Well, murders havebeen committed

21:08.430 --> 21:09.988
for far less, haven't they?

21:10.030 --> 21:11.895
There's more.

21:11.930 --> 21:15.889
Fyodor ukhov was arrested twice:Once in 2011

21:15.940 --> 21:17.305
and again in 2014.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.501
Both times for beating his wife.

21:32.550 --> 21:35.314
She's quite beautiful,is she not?

21:35.360 --> 21:37.055
Beg your pardon?

21:37.090 --> 21:38.887
The plane.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.989
Your eyes went straightto her when you arrived,

21:41.030 --> 21:43.362
and then you askedto speak in this room.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.391
She was my first.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.022
The real one, I mean.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.368
I paid $5 million.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.039
I'll give you the modelfor ten grand.

21:52.070 --> 21:54.800
How about we stickto the homicide, mr. Ukhov?

21:54.840 --> 21:56.102
Sorry, I don't understand.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.347
I don't know anythingabout this.

21:58.380 --> 21:59.847
Well, like I told you,i'm not here today

21:59.880 --> 22:02.713
in any official capacity,but, take my word,

22:02.750 --> 22:05.344
things are gettingmore official by the minute.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.449
What do you mean?

22:07.490 --> 22:09.458
The car inthose photos,

22:09.490 --> 22:11.082
my colleague helpedexamine it this morning.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.358
She sent me a message

22:12.390 --> 22:14.119
a little while ago,

22:14.160 --> 22:16.048
said there were palm printson the passenger-side window

22:16.100 --> 22:17.863
that matched yours.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.788
Your prints werein the system, of course,

22:19.830 --> 22:23.095
thanks to the two times that youbeat your wife half to death.

22:23.140 --> 22:26.837
Not that we think thosewere isolated incidents.

22:26.870 --> 22:29.839
You shouldn't judge what youdon't understand, detective.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.144
I saw the photosof what you did to her.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.910
My understanding's pretty clear.

22:37.180 --> 22:41.059
About a week ago, I realizedthis man was following me.

22:41.090 --> 22:43.729
I assumed on behalfof my wife's lawyers.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.479
But, until now,i didn't know his name.

22:46.530 --> 22:48.851
And I certainly didn'tdo anything as interesting

22:48.900 --> 22:51.869
as stage a suicide.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.596
Explain the prints on his car.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.564
I slapped on his window

22:57.610 --> 22:59.862
and threateneda restraining order.

22:59.910 --> 23:02.128
I wanted him to knowthat i'd seen him.

23:02.180 --> 23:03.738
That was all.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.941
And it all happenedin front of a restaurant

23:05.980 --> 23:08.778
in sight of the valets.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.084
You don't believe me, ask them.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.439
(Phone chimes)

23:17.530 --> 23:20.499
I'll need the nameof the restaurant.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.124
Think you'reslipping, man.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.638
Heard you knock something overwhen you broke into his office.

23:27.670 --> 23:30.639
Yeah, knocked a bloody coffeecup off the window sill.

23:30.670 --> 23:31.864
Didn't break.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.207
He didn't hear,did he?No.

23:33.240 --> 23:37.472
No. Well, I took photographsof some things I found.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.440
This is intel on roy.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.744
Says here the credit searchwas prepared by an investigator

23:43.790 --> 23:46.839
named joseph tommolino.

23:46.890 --> 23:50.087
Ukhov admitted that he made roy.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.588
Said his prints were on the carbecause he approached roy

23:52.630 --> 23:54.188
in front of a restauranttwo days ago.

23:54.230 --> 23:56.596
So either he or tommolinomust've taken these

23:56.630 --> 23:58.461
and run the plates.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.922
From there, they pulled upeverything on him.

23:59.970 --> 24:01.562
Including the nameof his ex-wife

24:01.600 --> 24:04.103
and the address theyused to share together.

24:06.110 --> 24:07.509
He's our guy.

24:07.540 --> 24:08.768
Certainly appearsthat way.

24:08.810 --> 24:11.040
So if the policebring him in now,

24:11.080 --> 24:13.048
that's not gonna beenough to detain him.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.672
His explanation for hisfingerprints on the car

24:14.720 --> 24:15.948
could well be credible.

24:15.980 --> 24:17.538
His mere possessionof the materials

24:17.590 --> 24:20.184
just doesn't prove his guilt;No, we need more.

24:20.220 --> 24:22.484
And as quicklyas possible.What do you mean?

24:22.520 --> 24:24.659
Well, according to his calendar,he's leaving tonight.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.624
Three days of meetingsin the caymans.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.491
Be back at theend of the week.

24:28.530 --> 24:30.566
So I just told a gutho has unlimited access

24:30.600 --> 24:32.591
to private planesthat we're onto him.

24:32.630 --> 24:35.235
You're forgetting about the$20 million he has stashed away.

24:35.270 --> 24:37.500
(Softly):Yeah.

24:37.540 --> 24:38.507
He's not gonna run.

24:38.540 --> 24:41.031
How the hell could youpossibly know that, huh?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.503
I'm the one who talkedto the guy, not you.

24:43.550 --> 24:46.007
We know that on at leasttwo occasions,

24:46.050 --> 24:47.813
he savagely beat his wife.

24:47.850 --> 24:50.546
And he made no attemptto flee. Why?

24:50.590 --> 24:52.581
'Cause he thinks thathis lawyers and his money

24:52.620 --> 24:53.609
make him bulletproof.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.719
I've seen it hundreds of times.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.988
Yeah, but we're notjust trying to

24:57.020 --> 24:59.625
hang chantal's assault on him,we're trying to hang a homicide.

24:59.660 --> 25:02.629
Well, to a man like that,the difference is negligible.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.628
Three days.He'll be back.

25:04.670 --> 25:05.864
That's more thanenough time

25:05.900 --> 25:07.197
to make our case against him.

25:07.230 --> 25:09.596
We just need touse our time wisely.

25:09.640 --> 25:10.868
Trust me.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.032
Yeah, I trust you.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.773
*

25:51.110 --> 25:52.805
*

26:12.830 --> 26:14.138
(grunts loudly)

26:18.940 --> 26:20.567
(Engine starts)

26:22.380 --> 26:23.802
(Tires screeching)

26:26.810 --> 26:28.812
(Phone ringing)

26:32.220 --> 26:33.380
Hello?

26:33.420 --> 26:34.819
Sherlock:Leave mr. Ukhov be.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.215
He can call his own ambulance.

26:37.260 --> 26:40.184
Wait, was that... was that you?

26:40.230 --> 26:43.358
He won't be leavingthe country tonight after all.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.027
Whose phone are you on?

26:45.070 --> 26:46.799
It's a burner.

26:46.830 --> 26:49.867
After I hang up, i'll burn it,quite literally.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.869
Meet me at my home in one hour.We have much to discuss.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.310
Yeah. Thank you.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.640
(Clears throat)

27:04.690 --> 27:06.180
So it's confirmed.

27:06.220 --> 27:09.712
His... right tibiais fractured.

27:09.760 --> 27:13.821
He'll be prohibited fromair travel for 48 hours.

27:13.860 --> 27:15.828
What the hell didyou do tonight?

27:15.860 --> 27:18.260
Stopped you fromdoing far worse,

27:18.300 --> 27:19.858
if my read was right.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.128
So you couldbeat him up instead?

27:21.170 --> 27:22.728
Why stop me at all?

27:22.770 --> 27:24.863
There's thatdisappointment again.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.332
"Vengeance interruptus."

27:26.370 --> 27:28.304
Look, I didn't stop you

27:28.340 --> 27:29.739
to spare ukhov a beating.

27:29.780 --> 27:31.008
The man's a piece of excrement,

27:31.050 --> 27:32.403
deserves ten times worse.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.771
You were gonna throw awayyour career.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.311
Now, I wasn't gonnalet that happen.

27:37.350 --> 27:39.045
So you decided togo down with me.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.182
Ukhov is still

27:40.220 --> 27:41.448
gonna connectthat he got attacked

27:41.490 --> 27:43.310
just a few hours afteran off-duty cop

27:43.360 --> 27:44.918
accused him of murder.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.258
Only now it's gonna come downon both our heads.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.291
How is that better?

27:48.330 --> 27:50.252
He's not gonna connect it.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.291
He thinks he's the victimof a car theft.

27:52.330 --> 27:54.890
As we speak, an associateof mine is loading

27:54.940 --> 27:57.909
his ferrari onto a shippingcontainer bound for qingdao.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.261
If it's evertracked down,

28:00.310 --> 28:02.130
the smugglers,in a rare moment of honesty,

28:02.180 --> 28:04.148
will deny any knowledgeof how it got there.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.048
So watson mentioneda story you told her

28:10.080 --> 28:12.082
about your motherbeing severely injured

28:12.120 --> 28:14.884
after being hit by a car.

28:14.920 --> 28:18.253
She wasn't hit by a car,though, was she?

28:20.260 --> 28:22.251
Did your fatherstrike her frequently?

28:27.330 --> 28:29.161
Not just her.

28:31.170 --> 28:32.432
How did you know?

28:32.470 --> 28:35.439
There have always been signs.

28:35.480 --> 28:39.143
Almost always are whenit comes to victims of abuse.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.275
Sorry.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.447
For what? Seeing signs?

28:45.490 --> 28:47.117
No, no.

28:47.150 --> 28:48.412
Lying to you this morning.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.280
I told you I thoughtthat working the case

28:50.320 --> 28:53.426
would be the best thing for you,but, you know, the truth is...

28:53.460 --> 28:55.189
You didn't want to let meout of your sight.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.360
You could see tonightcoming a mile away.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.097
We all need to treadmore carefully from here on.

29:02.140 --> 29:05.029
So our collaborationon this case is over.

29:05.070 --> 29:07.061
Go back to the hospital.

29:07.110 --> 29:08.338
I'll apprise watson

29:08.380 --> 29:10.871
of the situation in the morning.

29:10.910 --> 29:14.038
And, um, i'll be leavingcertain details out.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.911
The hobbling of fyodor ukhov?

29:15.950 --> 29:16.769
For example.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.742
Yeah.

29:20.450 --> 29:23.112
You were right.

29:23.160 --> 29:26.379
About me doing worse to himif you hadn't stopped me.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.290
Truth is...

29:29.330 --> 29:31.389
I don't know how fari would've gone.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.459
(Chuckles)

29:38.510 --> 29:41.035
I didn't knownypd used consultants.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.433
Where do I sign up?

29:42.480 --> 29:43.970
This is not a job fair,mr. Tommolino.

29:44.010 --> 29:45.409
We're here to talk to you about

29:45.450 --> 29:47.008
some work you didfor fyodor ukhov.

29:47.050 --> 29:48.574
Holmes: Your girlfriendtold us where to find you.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.939
You know, she seemedto take some pleasure

29:49.980 --> 29:52.346
in telling usyou got your roots done.

29:55.390 --> 29:57.187
We're good fora few minutes, right?

30:03.330 --> 30:04.490
Where'd you get these?

30:04.530 --> 30:06.020
Holmes:That's not important.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.321
What is importantis what we suspect

30:07.370 --> 30:08.928
fyodor ukhov did with them.

30:08.970 --> 30:11.461
He asked you to look intothe man in those photos,

30:11.510 --> 30:13.102
roy booker.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.937
Using the informationthat you gave him,

30:14.980 --> 30:15.901
we think that ukhov,

30:15.940 --> 30:18.044
or more likelysomeone who worked with him,

30:19.980 --> 30:22.141
and then murdered roy.Whoa, hold on a second.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.216
We're not asking youif you did it, mr. Tommolino.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.888
We spent the morninglooking into you.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.512
And from what your colleaguestell us about you,

30:27.550 --> 30:29.415
you wouldn't dothat kind of dirty work.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.054
No, our question to you is:Did you know?

30:32.090 --> 30:33.921
Because if you did andyou're withholding evidence

30:33.960 --> 30:36.849
that could put ukhovaway, then obviously

30:36.900 --> 30:38.561
that would make youan accessory to murder.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.489
I swear to you, if I had known athing about what you're saying,

30:41.540 --> 30:43.337
I would've calledthe cops myself.

30:43.370 --> 30:45.930
I have no ideawhat ukhov did with that info.

30:45.970 --> 30:49.508
I e-mailed it to him yesterday,and we haven't spoken since.

30:49.540 --> 30:50.529
Yesterday.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.548
Yeah, first thingin the morning.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.343
Why?

30:55.380 --> 30:57.644
When did the thingsyou're talking about happen?

30:57.680 --> 31:00.240
Chantal milner was attackedthree nights ago.

31:00.290 --> 31:03.509
Roy booker was killedthe night after that.

31:03.560 --> 31:08.953
Feel free to read my e-mails.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.197
At the riskof stating the obvious,

31:12.230 --> 31:14.630
there's no waymr. Ukhov did what you said.

31:14.670 --> 31:16.661
He didn't even knowwho roy booker was

31:16.700 --> 31:19.260
until the morning afterthe guy was dead.

31:20.670 --> 31:23.377
And tommolino's storychecks out?

31:23.410 --> 31:25.469
Yeah. He took usback to his office

31:25.510 --> 31:27.478
and showed us hisbrowser history:

31:27.510 --> 31:30.616
When he ran roy's plates,when he did the credit search.

31:30.650 --> 31:31.981
It all fits.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.339
So, unless this ukhov guy

31:33.390 --> 31:35.551
hired two detectivesto do the same work,

31:35.590 --> 31:37.683
he's not our killer.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.324
What about chantal?

31:39.360 --> 31:41.055
Any word?Actually, thedoctor called

31:41.100 --> 31:43.660
and said it looks likeshe's turning a corner.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.395
Marcus seemed pretty good.

31:45.430 --> 31:46.692
That's good.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.664
So what's next?

31:48.700 --> 31:50.338
Sherlock and istarted looking

31:50.370 --> 31:53.100
into the other divorcsthat roy was investigating.

31:53.140 --> 31:55.005
We were wrong aboutukhov being the killer,

31:55.040 --> 31:56.439
but he was hardlythe only husband

31:56.480 --> 31:57.970
hiding millionsfrom his wife.

31:58.010 --> 31:59.307
So we figureany one of them

31:59.350 --> 32:01.545
could've gone after royfor the same reasons.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.617
So these are roy's travelrecords from the last month.

32:04.650 --> 32:06.186
We've been going through them

32:06.220 --> 32:08.984
to see who he's beentailing, where and when.

32:09.020 --> 32:12.353
Gregson: Flights to the caymans,the bahamas, the cook islands.

32:12.390 --> 32:15.120
If it didn't get him killed,i'd say he was living the life.

32:15.160 --> 32:18.027
Well, his local travelis actually why i'm here.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.492
Now, my used a phone app

32:19.530 --> 32:21.236
to log the mileshe drove for work.

32:21.270 --> 32:22.464
It was equippedwith gps,

32:22.500 --> 32:26.334
so we were ableto see exactly where he went.

32:26.370 --> 32:30.033
He visiteda chinese herbalist in queens?

32:30.080 --> 32:31.547
Yeah, that one just seemed odd.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.445
We couldn't finda connection to any case,

32:33.480 --> 32:35.710
so sherlock's on his way thereto check it out.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.741
Now, there's alsoa bank in brooklyn

32:37.780 --> 32:40.010
that my visited a few times.

32:40.050 --> 32:42.382
As far as we can tell, he didnot have an account there,

32:42.420 --> 32:44.229
and neither did anyof the divorcs.

32:44.260 --> 32:45.727
I called the branch manager.

32:45.760 --> 32:49.127
It turns out that my wasrenting a safe deposit box.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.596
And you need a warrantso we can see what's inside.

32:52.630 --> 32:56.134
I thinkjudge riley's in today.

33:05.550 --> 33:06.574
What did you find outat the herbalist?

33:06.610 --> 33:09.716
Well, my wasn't therein his capacity as a p.I.,

33:09.750 --> 33:11.183
he was there as a customer.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.745
Two weeks ago,he bought a decoction of herbs:

33:17.690 --> 33:19.555
You're saying thatroy was doing a cleanse?

33:19.590 --> 33:20.659
Yeah, I am.

33:20.690 --> 33:22.055
And that mean anything?

33:22.100 --> 33:24.091
I'm not sure yet.

33:28.470 --> 33:30.028
(Gregson whistles)

33:30.070 --> 33:33.062
Looks like abouta hundred grand in here.

33:33.110 --> 33:35.328
Watson: These are some of thedivorcs that roy was following.

33:35.380 --> 33:36.699
Including ukhov.

33:36.740 --> 33:38.344
And presumablythe accounts he uncovered

33:38.380 --> 33:39.745
where they werehiding their money.

33:39.780 --> 33:42.749
Why these names on this list?

33:42.780 --> 33:45.089
Think roy wasn't tellinganyone what he found?

33:45.120 --> 33:46.348
He was blackmailing theminstead,

33:46.390 --> 33:49.154
and one of themkilled him to put a stop to it?

33:49.190 --> 33:50.680
I don't think so.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.085
You asked whether roy's cleanse

33:52.130 --> 33:53.552
has anything to dowith this case.

33:53.590 --> 33:55.194
I have to confirm a few things,

33:55.230 --> 33:57.323
but if i'm right,the answer's yes.

33:59.130 --> 34:01.166
And I thinkI knowwho killed him.

34:07.410 --> 34:10.777
Thank you so much formeeting me here, mrs. Ukhov.

34:10.810 --> 34:13.278
I know that coming to yoursoon-to-be ex-husband's office

34:13.310 --> 34:15.210
is not your idea of fun,

34:15.250 --> 34:17.844
but as will soon become clear,it was absolutely necessary.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.108
Please.

34:19.150 --> 34:21.254
I still don't gethow you were so sure

34:21.290 --> 34:23.281
fyodor wouldn't be here.Hmm.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.584
Well, that's a story i'msure you would appreciate,

34:25.630 --> 34:29.691
but unfortunately i'm notat liberty to share it.

34:29.730 --> 34:31.721
Now, as I mentionedon the phone,

34:31.770 --> 34:33.123
i'm assisting the nypd

34:33.170 --> 34:34.068
in the final stagesof an investigation.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.465
A woman, an assistantdistrict attorney,

34:35.500 --> 34:37.092
as a matter of fact,was assaulted,

34:37.140 --> 34:39.335
and a former police officerwas killed.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.702
And you thinkfyodor was involved?

34:41.740 --> 34:42.672
Only indirectly.

34:42.710 --> 34:45.838
But it's information on himthat we need.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.371
Now, in a moment--if you agree--

34:48.420 --> 34:50.115
you and I aregonna call a bank

34:50.150 --> 34:51.686
in the cayman islands,

34:51.720 --> 34:53.449
and we're going torequest information

34:53.490 --> 34:54.684
regarding an account there.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.210
The account belongsto a company

34:56.260 --> 34:58.455
which has billedyour husband's company

34:58.490 --> 35:00.481
millions of dollarsover the years

35:00.530 --> 35:02.748
in "document handling fees."

35:02.800 --> 35:05.519
The truth is, thesecharges are fabrications.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.697
Your husband ownsthat company as well,

35:07.730 --> 35:10.699
and he's using itto hide money.

35:10.740 --> 35:14.232
So you see, by helping me,you're also helping yourself.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.702
Go on.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.378
The bank will haveseveral layers

35:17.410 --> 35:21.642
of security that we willneed to... negotiate.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.649
Firstly, their system willautomatically identify

35:24.690 --> 35:26.612
the phone numberthat we are calling from.

35:26.650 --> 35:28.618
Hence, the need to meet here.

35:28.660 --> 35:32.187
Secondly, they're going to havea series of security questions,

35:32.230 --> 35:34.653
the specifics of whichi can't predict.

35:34.700 --> 35:38.625
But you figure if anyone willknow fyodor's first dog's name

35:38.670 --> 35:41.662
or the town his fatherwas born in, it would be me.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.895
Lastly, they're going to askfor a pin number,

35:43.940 --> 35:45.908
chosen by your husband,

35:45.940 --> 35:48.170
about which I could speculatelittle more.

35:48.210 --> 35:50.929
So this number, we're thinking,

35:50.980 --> 35:53.801
it's something fyodoris unlikely to forget.

35:53.850 --> 35:55.545
Somethingmeaningful to him.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.639
More than I was,for instance.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.911
Something he actually loves.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.180
You have a number in mind?

36:03.220 --> 36:04.778
I do.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.464
Detective bell.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.764
Sorry, there must havebeen some mix-up.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.633
I told janineto bring you to my office.

36:17.670 --> 36:19.968
No mix-up.

36:20.010 --> 36:23.229
I asked that wedo it in here.

36:23.280 --> 36:27.569
What exactly is it we're doing?

36:27.610 --> 36:30.249
This is my associate,miss watson.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.884
Obviously, you're awareof your own clients.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.945
Bell: When mr. Holmes and iwere here the other day,

36:33.990 --> 36:35.958
you expresseda lot of concern about

36:35.990 --> 36:37.014
attorney-client privilege.

36:37.060 --> 36:39.449
So we figured the best wayto resolve that issue

36:39.490 --> 36:41.924
would be to have all four of theclients this discussion involves

36:41.960 --> 36:43.655
here in this room.

36:43.700 --> 36:46.965
We've all waived privilegein writing, ted.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.230
Also, you're fired.

36:49.270 --> 36:52.808
Bell:We found this in a safe depositbox
that belonged to my booker.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.707
It lists some ofthe bank accounts

36:55.740 --> 36:58.004
roy helped you uncoverfor your clients

36:58.040 --> 37:00.008
and the balancesin those accounts.

37:00.050 --> 37:01.813
We've confirmed thatall the amounts are accurate.

37:01.850 --> 37:04.614
Thing is, according toeach of your clients here,

37:04.650 --> 37:08.279
you told them you foundway less money than you did.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.309
Watson: We suspect thatyou've been cutting deals

37:09.360 --> 37:12.386
with the spouses you'resupposed to be opposing.

37:12.430 --> 37:15.558
So you lie to your clientsabout how much money you find,

37:15.600 --> 37:17.955
then the husbands get tokeep most of their millions.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.719
In exchange,you get healthy kickbacks.

37:20.770 --> 37:24.308
You "suspect"?

37:25.810 --> 37:28.973
Roy's safe deposit box also hada hundred grand in cash in it.

37:29.010 --> 37:30.807
Now, you're licensedto practice law

37:30.840 --> 37:32.808
in both new york and new jersey.

37:32.850 --> 37:34.317
When you took thebar in jersey,

37:34.350 --> 37:35.817
you had to giveyour fingerprints.

37:35.850 --> 37:38.318
They matched prints wefound all over the cash.

37:38.350 --> 37:41.353
Roy discovered what you weredoing and shook you down.

37:41.390 --> 37:43.017
You paid him off at least once,

37:43.060 --> 37:44.459
but i'm guessingyou weren't interested

37:44.490 --> 37:46.026
in making itan ongoing arrangement.

37:46.060 --> 37:47.823
You needed to get rid of him,

37:47.860 --> 37:50.397
but the last thing you wantedwas a murder investigation.

37:50.430 --> 37:52.489
Watson: You had heardabout all the drama

37:52.530 --> 37:54.361
that my and his ex-wifewere mixed up in,

37:54.400 --> 37:56.391
thanks to the friend whorecommended my to you,

37:56.440 --> 37:57.998
ardy gulbenkian.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.907
So you beat up chantal milner and you framed roy,

38:00.940 --> 38:01.804
so that when you killed him,

38:01.840 --> 38:03.899
people would believe it was suicide.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.079
That's... amazing.

38:06.110 --> 38:07.771
And if i'm following,

38:07.810 --> 38:09.675
all you're really basing it on

38:09.720 --> 38:12.416
is that you've uncoveredsome clerical errors

38:12.450 --> 38:14.486
and found some moneyi touched.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.408
Which, for all you know,

38:16.460 --> 38:20.089
has my prints on itbecause roy stole it from me.

38:20.130 --> 38:23.054
Everything else you've said,anything to do

38:23.100 --> 38:25.660
with this beatingor roy's murder,

38:25.700 --> 38:28.396
is pure speculation.

38:29.570 --> 38:32.607
Now, I admit,i'm not a criminal lavwern

38:32.640 --> 38:35.473
though believe me,i know some good ones--

38:35.510 --> 38:38.001
but what I haven'theard yet

38:38.040 --> 38:41.646
is a shred of proof.

38:41.680 --> 38:45.013
If that was all we had,you would be correct.

38:45.050 --> 38:46.483
But it isn't.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.112
Couple weeks ago,

38:48.150 --> 38:51.119
roy booker purchased amixture of chinese herbs.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.822
They're meant to, uh,f|ush the body of toxins.

38:53.860 --> 38:58.559
Some people use them as a detoxprior to a workplace drug test.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.989
Bell: Around the same time,you ordered a drug test

39:01.030 --> 39:02.133
for all your employees.

39:02.170 --> 39:03.899
It occurred to mr. Holmes

39:03.940 --> 39:07.467
that my might've been usingthe herbs for that purpose,

39:07.510 --> 39:08.932
because it came upin his autopsy

39:08.980 --> 39:11.073
that he'd beensmoking pot.

39:11.110 --> 39:14.375
This is asigned affidavit

39:14.420 --> 39:16.911
from the lab tech whoadministered the test,

39:16.950 --> 39:19.111
saying that you slippedhim a thousand bucks

39:19.150 --> 39:21.948
in exchange forroy's urine.

39:23.990 --> 39:25.855
You're a quick thinker,mr. Winthrop.

39:25.890 --> 39:28.051
But i'd love to hear youexplain that.

39:34.030 --> 39:35.531
Hello.

39:35.570 --> 39:37.037
Catch you at a good time?

39:37.070 --> 39:39.436
Yeah, come in.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.548
So I hear chantal's improving.

39:47.580 --> 39:50.413
Yeah, I justcame from there.

39:50.450 --> 39:52.987
She's, uh,she's conscious.

39:53.020 --> 39:55.887
Talking a little,sleeping a lot.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.457
It's gonna be a long road,but it looks good.

39:58.490 --> 39:59.718
Doctors are running some tests,

39:59.760 --> 40:03.127
so I figuredi'd give them some space.

40:04.900 --> 40:08.563
Look, I just came byto say thanks,

40:08.600 --> 40:10.932
for being my eyes andears the last few days.

40:10.970 --> 40:15.077
And to let you know that i'm...I'm gonna talk to someone.

40:15.110 --> 40:17.704
About all thisstuff that came up,

40:17.740 --> 40:20.641
that I obviously hadn'tbeen dealing with.

40:20.680 --> 40:24.889
I'm not sure who,but i'm asking around.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.718
I don't presume to know thedetails of what your father did

40:27.750 --> 40:29.911
to you and your family.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.781
But, um, i-i've seen enoughparental abuse

40:32.830 --> 40:36.493
to know that one thing'salways the same.

40:36.530 --> 40:40.489
When someone whose job it is tonurture you hurts you instead,

40:40.530 --> 40:44.534
it-it can't help but have aprofound and-and lasting effect

40:44.570 --> 40:46.800
on your sense of who you are.

40:48.940 --> 40:52.068
I-i stopped youfrom beating ukhov

40:52.110 --> 40:54.613
because I didn't want youto throw away your career,

40:54.650 --> 40:59.542
but more importantly, I didn'twant you to throw away yourself.

40:59.590 --> 41:04.857
I mean, i-i might bethis extraordinary detective,

41:04.890 --> 41:07.859
but you arean extraordinary man.

41:07.890 --> 41:11.724
And-and that'sa far more precious thing.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.091
Isn't it?

41:14.130 --> 41:17.964
*

41:18.000 --> 41:20.867
have you ever eaten ants?

41:20.910 --> 41:22.969
I'm sorry, what?

41:23.010 --> 41:24.739
Have you ever eaten ants?

41:24.780 --> 41:26.145
There's this new restaurant

41:26.180 --> 41:28.740
I was going to try.

41:28.780 --> 41:31.510
It's, uh, insect-based cuisine.

41:31.550 --> 41:34.587
I hear the silkworm soupis a must.

41:34.620 --> 41:36.178
Best I can promise isi'll watch.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.284
I mean, i'll try to watch.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.150
Great.
