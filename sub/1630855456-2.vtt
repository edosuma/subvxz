WEBVTT

00:12.679 --> 00:16.683
I'm sorry, did you just say Grace put
something in Edgar's drink last night?

00:16.683 --> 00:19.102
Zoë, who is this woman?

00:19.102 --> 00:20.354
This is Detective Danner.

00:20.354 --> 00:24.107
She helped clear Aniq
when he was accused of murdering Xavier.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.651
- Falsely.
- Right.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.069
She can help.

00:27.069 --> 00:30.030
Hey, I thought we agreed.
No police just yet.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.866
Don't worry, blue eyes.
I ain't the police no more.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.451
Aniq asked me to come down

00:34.451 --> 00:37.871
and discreetly look into a few things
before the fuzz arrives.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.956
The fuzz?

00:38.956 --> 00:42.084
Look, weddings bring up
some complicated feelings.

00:42.084 --> 00:45.754
About love, about money. Family.

00:45.754 --> 00:50.050
And those feelings make people
do things they normally wouldn't do.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.094
Even murder.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.347
So, I'd like to talk to everybody here

00:55.347 --> 00:58.851
and hear your accounts
of what happened this weekend.

00:58.851 --> 01:01.812
I like to call them your mind movies.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.730
- We're all stars of our own movies.
- Hey,

01:03.730 --> 01:06.316
why did you tell her Grace
put something in Edgar's drink?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.861
'Cause she did. I saw her do it.

01:08.861 --> 01:13.782
Okay, but we brought Danner here to help
us prove that Grace didn't do it, right?

01:13.782 --> 01:14.867
Right.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.035
- Same page?
- Same page.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.872
Okay. Grace, I'll start with you.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.070
Hey. Just so we're clear,

02:33.570 --> 02:35.781
I really need you
to get Grace off for this.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.450
You mean, you really need me
to find out who the real killer is?

02:38.450 --> 02:41.453
Exactly. Okay. So, same page.

02:42.037 --> 02:42.996
Hold up.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.666
- What's up?
- You coming in here with me, puzzle boy.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.168
- I am?
- We solved the Xavier case together.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.253
We're partners.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.132
Well, I mean,
if you think I could be of service.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.509
- Come on.
- Yeah.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.102
I wanna start out
by saying I'm sorry for your loss.

03:06.103 --> 03:09.940
But my God,
those wedding photos are gonna be fire.

03:09.940 --> 03:14.444
Look at how good that damn dress look
on you, girl, fitting like a glove.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.154
Thank you.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.824
You know it's vintage?
I actually restored it myself.

03:18.824 --> 03:19.950
I like it too.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.495
Look, I didn't kill my husband, okay?

03:23.495 --> 03:25.664
I wasn't poisoning his drink,

03:25.664 --> 03:27.499
- I was jus--
- Knock knock.

03:28.375 --> 03:34.089
I just wanted to drop this off,
because Grace tends to run a little cold.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.799
I guess I'll just leave this here.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.927
Unless you want me to stay?

03:38.927 --> 03:41.096
- I think you wanna stay.
- I do, actually.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.473
- It's okay, right? If I stay?
- I think so.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.142
You know,
the more the merrier and all that.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.979
Uh-huh. So, Grace, how did you two meet?

03:49.730 --> 03:51.190
It was recent, right?

03:51.190 --> 03:53.108
We met y-- six months ago.

03:54.026 --> 03:56.904
I had just broken up
with this guy who-- He stole my underwear.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.907
- Travis. It was Travis, right?
- Surprisingly not, actually.

03:59.907 --> 04:03.702
Yeah, so Grace has always been
unlucky in love.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.829
No, I love being in love.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.497
I just never found the right person.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.751
Well, until I met Edgar.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.837
He's kind of just my type.

04:14.588 --> 04:18.382
Like, boyishly handsome, a little odd.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.139
<i>I was at work. I have an antique shop.</i>

04:24.139 --> 04:27.935
<i>Well, not a shop. It's more of an area
inside of a larger crafting co-op.</i>

04:27.935 --> 04:32.105
<i>Anyway, I was restoring this beautiful
19th-century baby doll when...</i>

04:32.105 --> 04:33.774
Good afternoon, madam. I was searching--

04:40.697 --> 04:43.033
Apologies, sir. I just--
I wasn't expecting to see a lizard.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.535
My apologies.

04:44.535 --> 04:47.246
I wasn't expecting a scream.

04:48.038 --> 04:52.417
I've come to
inquire about a vintage typewriter.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.794
Oh, yes.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.259
May I ask, is this for you
or for your companion?

05:00.259 --> 05:02.219
- Oh, Roxana?
- Yes.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.888
No, she wouldn't have much use
for a typewriter.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.474
Because she prefers calligraphy?

05:10.269 --> 05:11.270
You're making a joke.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.314
I like jokes.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.360
<i>He was awkward, but there
was something disarming about him.</i>

05:18.360 --> 05:21.738
If you don't mind my prying,
what are your plans for it?

05:22.739 --> 05:24.408
It's a gift for my dear sister,

05:24.408 --> 05:27.286
who has an affinity for the things
of yesteryear.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.203
Yeah.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.290
Whereas I'm more focused on
what's to come. Technology and the like.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.294
This work of art holds much more value
than anything with a screen.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.297
Are you Amish,
or do you just detest convenience?

05:38.297 --> 05:39.464
Just look at it.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.551
The way it speaks to you.

05:43.302 --> 05:46.471
Cheering you on
as you write your next great novel or--

05:47.389 --> 05:48.974
or a missive to your deepest love.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.895
And then, once you've finished,

05:53.395 --> 05:55.147
you rip the page from the chamber

05:55.147 --> 06:00.110
as you've just ripped the words
from your heart and you hold it...

06:02.029 --> 06:03.030
in your hands.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.827
I'm afraid I have business to attend to.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.831
I'll settle my debt and be on my way.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.476
I realize this may be too forward,

06:34.019 --> 06:36.438
but I would like to ask you
to accompany me

06:36.438 --> 06:40.400
to my sister's birthday celebration
tomorrow evening.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.195
You see,
my lizard has taken a liking to you,

06:44.696 --> 06:46.281
and I'd hate to disappoint her.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.408
I'd hate to disappoint her also.

06:49.535 --> 06:50.536
Well--

06:57.084 --> 06:58.752
<i>It was so unexpected.</i>

06:58.752 --> 07:01.463
<i>And I knew nothing about him
but the name on his credit card.</i>

07:02.631 --> 07:06.176
Mr. Edgar Minnows and guest.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.853
I've never been to a party like this.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.106
Are those ladies pointing at us?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.315
I'm afraid so.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.317
Who are you exactly?

07:22.317 --> 07:23.652
Did you not google me?

07:23.652 --> 07:25.404
Why, pray tell, would I google you?

07:25.404 --> 07:28.615
What a bewitchingly peculiar lass you are.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.326
Pardon. Grace, sorry, I know you're
in the middle of a conversation,

07:31.326 --> 07:34.746
but I am just so pleased
to make your acquaintance.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.498
We're going to be the best of friends!

07:36.498 --> 07:38.333
You must be Edgar's sister.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.877
- Adopted.
- Adopted.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.753
- Yes. Walk with me.
- Okay.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.173
So, you two have created quite a stir.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.966
The society papers, <i>Fast Company</i>,

07:45.966 --> 07:50.345
has named Edgar the most eligible bachelor
of Silicon Valley.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.308
So those whispering women,
they're jealous of me?

07:54.308 --> 07:57.352
They're positively stropping. Hello?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.980
Well, let's not disappoint them then.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.148
Yes.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.527
Silicon Valley's Most Eligible Bachelor.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.906
Would you honor me with a dance?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.700
No, I don't dance.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.328
The last time I danced publicly,

08:14.328 --> 08:17.998
a vicar identified me as a ghoul
and submitted me for exorcism.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.210
I'm quite uncomfortable
with any sort of public attention,

08:21.210 --> 08:23.462
- and there's been too much of it already.
- I see.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.673
I have an idea.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.010
We're going straight towards the dancing.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.976
There. Look, no one else is around.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.104
Now is our time to partake in a dance.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.110
I've never met anyone like you.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.363
Likewise.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.406
What dance shall we partake in?

08:52.449 --> 08:55.244
Shall we do the Unwed Lady?

08:55.244 --> 08:57.538
Or perhaps the Boy Soldier?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.040
Or maybe

09:00.040 --> 09:02.626
I could teach you how to Douglas.

09:04.461 --> 09:08.131
Grace, I don't think my body can do any
of those things.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.261
And Roxana relishes dance,
but only as a spectator.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.180
Well, then we must give Roxana a show.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.183
Come here.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.773
Now, the trick is
you just can't think about it too much.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.526
Just do whatever your body wants.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.492
Yes.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.204
That's quite nice.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.497
- Yes.
- Yeah.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.251
- Grace.
- Yeah?

09:44.251 --> 09:45.210
Who are you?

09:46.795 --> 09:50.215
You've brought me to
the verge of gyration.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.429
- This is good.
- Wonderful.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.973
I feel like a scallywag.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.225
- Now take my hand.
- Yes.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.319
I don't normally do things
I don't want to do.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.822
I think we have that in common.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.076
Oh, fuck. Yes.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.747
Pardon my interruption, sir.

10:21.747 --> 10:25.125
There is some urgent business
to which you must attend.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.296
I must go.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.717
Roxana.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.809
I have never seen him like this before.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.897
You have bewitched him.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.573
<i>Of course,
I googled him as soon as I got home.</i>

10:56.573 --> 10:59.076
<i>Edgar Minnows, tech titan.</i>

10:59.076 --> 11:01.537
<i>And suddenly, I was part of his world.</i>

11:01.537 --> 11:04.206
<i>He even asked if he could introduce me
to his mother.</i>

11:04.206 --> 11:06.208
<i>He warned me she could be difficult.</i>

11:06.208 --> 11:08.210
Apologies for our lateness, Mother.

11:09.086 --> 11:12.047
Our driver was high on Robitussin
and kept getting confused.

11:12.047 --> 11:17.970
So, this is the girl my son proclaims
to be so taken with.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.181
Pleased to meet you, Gail.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.641
It's Grace, actually.

11:22.641 --> 11:23.892
What did you say to me?

11:23.892 --> 11:26.562
I told you her name is Grace.

11:26.562 --> 11:28.313
Why would you say otherwise?

11:28.939 --> 11:32.901
Because a woman of her station
looks more like a Gail.

11:33.902 --> 11:39.575
Grace is a name befitting of someone
who has her beauty, her sense of whimsy,

11:39.575 --> 11:41.827
her passion for all things in this life.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.203
I apologize.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.789
Ever since my father's passing,
Mother is easily confused.

11:45.789 --> 11:49.418
I am not confused,
and certainly not easily.

11:50.002 --> 11:52.171
Also, I am not confused.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.465
And there she goes.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.633
I'm sorry.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.180
<i>Most men I've dated are
afraid of their mothers,</i>

12:01.180 --> 12:05.350
<i>but the way Edgar defended me,
I was over the moon.</i>

12:05.350 --> 12:08.312
Look, over 40 grapes.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.865
<i>Of course, he was often busy with work.</i>

12:24.328 --> 12:27.164
<i>But when he wasn't around,
I would spend time with Hannah.</i>

12:31.919 --> 12:33.337
<i>It was all so wonderful.</i>

12:34.421 --> 12:36.340
Grace, I need to--

12:39.384 --> 12:40.385
No!

12:40.886 --> 12:42.054
No, Grace.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.015
What are you doing? We'll get soaked.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.099
Grace.

12:47.601 --> 12:52.397
These past few months,
you've transfixed me.

12:54.566 --> 12:59.446
And now <i>Fast Company</i> is inquiring about
next month's Most Eligible Bachelors list,

12:59.446 --> 13:03.116
and I would like very much
not to be on it.

13:04.535 --> 13:05.619
I don't understand.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.914
Will you marry me?

13:27.057 --> 13:29.351
Should I assume that's a yes?

13:33.939 --> 13:35.899
<i>Edgar didn't want a long engagement,</i>

13:35.899 --> 13:37.484
<i>so we got to planning quickly.</i>

13:38.151 --> 13:42.239
<i>But our families came from
different worlds, so there was tension.</i>

13:43.824 --> 13:45.075
This looks delicious.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.535
That's potpourri.

13:46.535 --> 13:47.911
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

13:48.704 --> 13:52.666
Grace, I fear I'm always the one
filching your fiancé.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.085
Edgar, your jet awaits you.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.712
Filch means to take away.

13:56.712 --> 13:57.880
It's nothing nasty.

13:57.880 --> 13:58.964
Indeed.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.717
I'll be gone for a few weeks.
This is my itinerary.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.430
I trust you all implicitly.

14:06.430 --> 14:09.600
Very well. My son would like
the wedding here at the vineyard.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.727
It will be the event of the season.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.562
No expense will be spared.

14:14.188 --> 14:17.232
I thought we could reuse
the flower arrangement

14:17.232 --> 14:19.985
from the rehearsal dinner
for the reception.

14:20.569 --> 14:21.737
Wonderful idea.

14:21.737 --> 14:24.156
Why don't we just reuse the wine as well?

14:24.156 --> 14:27.367
We can walk around spitting it
into each other's mouths.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.873
I think it would be nice
if Hannah did the flower arrangements.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.334
I'd be honored.

14:35.834 --> 14:36.835
Sorry.

14:36.835 --> 14:39.922
I always envisioned my wedding
a more intimate affair.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.841
Personal, with family contributions.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.551
I don't understand
the words you're saying.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.764
Lady Isabel, while I am the King of Bing--
Just got this new frock made.

14:49.264 --> 14:52.684
I'm afraid we're not
so financially blessed as you Minnows.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.145
Don't worry.
We will pay for everything, as usual.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.355
Huzzah!

14:57.022 --> 14:59.358
It's not only about expense.

14:59.358 --> 15:01.902
It is Grace's wedding day.

15:01.902 --> 15:05.614
And it will be wonderful
because the people I love will be there.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.743
We will have
your grand wedding, Lady Isabel.

15:09.743 --> 15:13.038
But we will be serving
my father's bao bing for dessert.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.039
Wha--

15:14.039 --> 15:14.998
Very well.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.542
You'll not regret this, milady.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.085
You know you're eating air freshener?

15:18.836 --> 15:19.920
<i>With everything in motion,</i>

15:19.920 --> 15:23.173
<i>Edgar offered his family's summer cottage
for the bachelorette party.</i>

15:23.173 --> 15:25.634
I am so happy for you, my dear sister.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.680
I must admit, I had begun to fear that
you would never find a suitable match.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.516
Well. I do have a rogues' gallery of exes,

15:32.516 --> 15:34.476
but I knew Edgar would be different

15:34.476 --> 15:37.855
from the moment he whisked me off
to Amsterdam for lunch.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.274
How romantic.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.276
But of course,
his business meeting ran late,

15:42.276 --> 15:43.902
so I didn't actually see him there.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.529
You did not see him?

15:45.529 --> 15:50.367
No, but I walked along the canals,
and it was so beautiful.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.245
And then when I got home,
Edgar made up for it completely

15:53.245 --> 15:57.165
by taking me to a private business dinner
on his yacht.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.546
But you loathe boats.
You get dreadfully seasick.

16:02.546 --> 16:06.049
Well, yes, I was in bed for days,

16:06.049 --> 16:08.510
but Edgar sent his personal chef
to make me soup.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.470
- He did not bring the soup himself?
- No, well--

16:10.470 --> 16:13.348
'Cause he was closing
a very lucrative cryptocurrency deal,

16:13.348 --> 16:15.142
and it's consuming a lot of his time.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.729
But no matter. Once we're married,
everything will be rosy.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.398
You think marriage
will solve your problems.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.774
Sister,

16:22.774 --> 16:25.736
I must demand that you stop projecting
your unfortunate marriage

16:25.736 --> 16:27.446
to that oaf Brett on to my own.

16:27.446 --> 16:29.072
I am doing no such thing.

16:29.072 --> 16:32.409
You tell us of a whirlwind courtship,
and yet there is no suitor.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.911
Why must you be so cruel?

16:33.911 --> 16:36.955
Because you are so in love with the idea
of being in love

16:36.955 --> 16:39.750
that you cannot see that Edgar
does not make you happy.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.838
Do you really love him at all
or has his station blinded you?

16:45.422 --> 16:47.007
I did not say that.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.425
Well, you kind of implied it.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.511
All I did was ask
if you were actually happy

16:50.511 --> 16:53.514
or if you just felt
like you should be happy.

16:53.514 --> 16:57.184
And that's a really shitty thing to
ask someone at their bachelorette party.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.727
Well, I was worried about you.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.312
Well, stop worrying!

17:00.312 --> 17:02.231
You have to let me make my own choices.

17:02.231 --> 17:04.233
I did, and look how that turned out.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.028
Okay.

17:08.028 --> 17:12.281
Zoë, you, me and Aniq are gonna
have a small meeting in the hallway.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.867
Yeah, I think that's good, so...

17:13.867 --> 17:16.286
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.996
- That is not what I meant.
- Yeah, I know.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.915
You can't stay.
You're way too close to this.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.166
I'm not going anywhere. She is my sister.

17:23.502 --> 17:24.962
That's true. She is her sister.

17:24.962 --> 17:28.339
All I'm saying is, Zoë's talents
may be better used elsewhere.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.258
Right.

17:29.258 --> 17:31.385
Yep. I mean, that's also true.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.678
'Cause you know, like, maybe--

17:33.303 --> 17:36.306
While we're in there
getting people's statements,

17:36.306 --> 17:39.726
we need somebody out there, you know,
searching for clues.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.854
Okay. You know what? Fine.

17:42.479 --> 17:46.733
I am gonna conduct my own investigation,
and I'm gonna find real evidence

17:46.733 --> 17:48.902
that is better
than any evidence anyone's ever found.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.487
That would be great.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.200
I think she's mad.

17:56.869 --> 17:58.203
Sisters, right?

17:58.203 --> 18:01.081
Yeah. She's just trying
to look out for me.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.961
And I do run cold. So yeah.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.298
She did really upset me
at my bachelorette party, though.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.634
<i>But Hannah was there to comfort me.</i>

18:13.260 --> 18:15.971
Do you weep because your sister's
right or because she's wrong?

18:18.056 --> 18:19.183
I don't know.

18:19.892 --> 18:21.894
Edgar has been really busy, but...

18:24.771 --> 18:26.398
I know he wants to be with me.

18:27.608 --> 18:28.901
And what do you want?

18:36.700 --> 18:38.577
<i>I had plenty of time to think about it</i>

18:38.577 --> 18:41.872
<i>because I didn't see Edgar again
until the weekend of the wedding.</i>

18:44.458 --> 18:47.252
There you are, my hermitess.

18:48.086 --> 18:51.256
I've been searching the grounds for you.
The guests have begun to arrive.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.508
Shall we meet them?

18:54.051 --> 18:56.178
Do you remember
when we first fell in love?

18:56.678 --> 18:59.348
Dancing on the terrace
with no noise and distractions?

18:59.348 --> 19:00.682
Yes.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.936
I want that to be how we get married.

19:03.936 --> 19:06.772
Wait, are you suggesting we elope?

19:06.772 --> 19:09.399
It's just--
See, my sister had a very lavish wedding.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.360
It was held at an Elks Lodge,

19:11.360 --> 19:12.986
but they really went all out.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.197
And then the marriage turned out
to be a complete disaster,

19:15.197 --> 19:17.449
so I want our wedding to be about
the two of us.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.451
Doesn't that sound romantic?

19:19.451 --> 19:22.454
Oh, Grace, I agree. The worst thing
about a wedding is the guests.

19:23.163 --> 19:27.084
But they've already begun to arrive,
and everything's underway.

19:27.084 --> 19:28.335
We can't change now.

19:28.919 --> 19:33.632
But I promise today will be
about the two of us.

19:36.677 --> 19:37.928
I have something for you.

19:38.554 --> 19:39.721
A wedding present?

19:42.391 --> 19:43.392
My lady.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.435
A prenuptial agreement?

19:45.435 --> 19:47.396
A scroll of boundaries.

19:47.396 --> 19:50.274
You have to admit this is, like,
the exact opposite of romantic.

19:50.274 --> 19:53.318
But it clears financial concerns,
leaving only love.

19:53.318 --> 19:56.321
We remove the sharks,
leaving just us minnows.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.199
I like jokes.

19:59.783 --> 20:01.076
Can I sign it on Monday?

20:01.910 --> 20:04.997
Well, then it would be
a postnuptial agreement.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.250
But very well.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.670
I can't imagine that much will change
between now and Monday.

20:12.171 --> 20:15.757
Refused to sign prenup--

20:15.757 --> 20:18.468
I didn't refuse--
Can you just not write "refused"?

20:18.468 --> 20:21.180
Because I would have signed it on Monday,
if Edgar hadn't...

20:21.805 --> 20:23.557
Look, I was just upset, okay?

20:23.557 --> 20:26.018
And I was right too.
We should've just eloped.

20:26.018 --> 20:30.397
Because that rehearsal dinner was nothing
but distractions and nonsense.

20:31.148 --> 20:34.276
<i>Isabel had gone from difficult
to absolutely abhorrent.</i>

20:34.276 --> 20:37.988
We cannot accept this. Gail? Who is Gail?

20:37.988 --> 20:39.323
Mother, what is it?

20:39.323 --> 20:43.160
She either doesn't know your name
or has chosen to besmirch it.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.538
Gail. Again.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.624
Mother, how could you?

20:48.624 --> 20:51.251
Look at all the people losing their heads.

20:51.251 --> 20:55.923
Gail, Grace-- It's paper used
for wiping your sloppy mouth.

20:56.882 --> 20:59.551
She may be rich,
but she's certainly poor in manners.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.636
I apologize.

21:00.636 --> 21:03.347
A fortnight ago,
she had a 5-Hour Energy at a 7-Eleven,

21:03.347 --> 21:06.892
and has not been the same since.
I shall have Dr. Shulkind examine her.

21:07.518 --> 21:08.519
She's come undone.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.021
Yeah.

21:11.021 --> 21:15.275
<i>Then suddenly, I found myself
face-to-face with an old suitor.</i>

21:18.320 --> 21:20.405
- It was so good to see you.
- Miss Grace.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.786
You are as enchanting as the day you--

21:25.786 --> 21:28.080
As the day you broke my heart.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.208
Travis. You actually came?

21:31.208 --> 21:35.712
I have such great, great fondness
for our times together.

21:36.213 --> 21:37.589
You know-- Actually,

21:38.632 --> 21:42.636
I did invite all of my former suitors
as a bit of a courtesy, you see?

21:43.804 --> 21:47.057
I must say, I really thought
that you'd read between the lines.

21:48.225 --> 21:49.226
I have.

21:51.812 --> 21:52.813
Boop.

21:55.232 --> 21:58.151
<i>And as you know,
Sebastian unveiled Edgar's wedding gift.</i>

21:58.151 --> 21:59.778
Funcle Ulysses.

22:01.238 --> 22:03.365
What ho, revelers!

22:03.949 --> 22:05.617
- Funcle Ulysses!
- Funcle Ulysses!

22:06.702 --> 22:08.996
Those weeks I was away,
while you were planning the wedding,

22:08.996 --> 22:10.247
I was looking for him.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.625
I knew how much it meant to you
to have him here.

22:14.543 --> 22:17.045
So, you were upset about your funcle?

22:17.045 --> 22:19.423
- No.
- Well, wasn't that a nice thing he did?

22:19.423 --> 22:24.636
No, that was really sweet. I just would've
rather spent those weeks together.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.438
- Murderer!
- Oh, my God.

22:34.438 --> 22:39.193
The murderer always returns
to the scene of the crime.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.737
You're at the scene of the crime, Travis.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.781
Oh, shit. That looks bad.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.743
Okay, whatever.
I'm going in there to collect evidence.

22:47.743 --> 22:48.827
I like your moxie.

22:49.912 --> 22:52.164
I recognize it because I have it too.

22:52.956 --> 22:56.877
You're gonna want me in there, trust me.
I'm cool as ice.

22:56.877 --> 23:00.130
- Do you have more gloves?
- In the ski closet.

23:00.130 --> 23:05.594
So, for this next part, you need to know
that Edgar was really into biohacking.

23:05.594 --> 23:08.430
His plan was
to live until he was 140 years old,

23:08.430 --> 23:12.893
and then upload his life source
onto the cloud or something.

23:15.187 --> 23:18.190
My vitals are flagging. I must go to bed.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.816
No, but the party isn't over.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.277
It's our wedding weekend.

23:22.277 --> 23:25.405
And thusly, we will spend
the rest of our lives together.

23:26.031 --> 23:28.200
But I want that life
to be as long as possible,

23:28.200 --> 23:32.788
and CBC, Calibrated Bedtime Consistency,
is how I ensure it.

23:33.372 --> 23:36.708
I need rest. Like an owl or a blender.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.211
See?
My similes are already disintegrating.

23:39.795 --> 23:40.879
Good night, my love.

23:40.879 --> 23:43.966
<i>At the bachelorette party,
Zoë asked if I was happy.</i>

23:44.466 --> 23:46.885
<i>By the morning of the wedding,
I wasn't sure.</i>

23:49.304 --> 23:50.764
I have a gift for you.

23:51.265 --> 23:57.437
This hairpin has been worn by every
Minnows bride since the Civil War.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.730
I expect you to wear it.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.816
- It's hideous.
- It's priceless.

24:00.816 --> 24:02.901
- Grace, you do not have to wear this.
- Yes, she does.

24:02.901 --> 24:04.611
- No, she does not--
- I'll wear it.

24:05.904 --> 24:06.905
The prenup.

24:07.906 --> 24:12.077
Why haven't you signed it?
You sign this before you marry my son.

24:12.077 --> 24:14.454
Wait. What is this?

24:15.539 --> 24:19.084
Is this some kind of recreational drug
in my house?

24:19.084 --> 24:21.753
It's Adderall. To stay awake.

24:22.337 --> 24:23.422
Can I have it?

24:24.131 --> 24:25.132
Sure.

24:28.802 --> 24:31.388
What a strange and horrible woman.

24:35.100 --> 24:36.101
What?

24:36.810 --> 24:37.895
Nothing.

24:37.895 --> 24:42.232
Let us put this priceless hairpin
on your head,

24:42.232 --> 24:46.236
so that you can become a Minnows.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.786
- You don't think I should marry him.
- I did not say that.

24:54.786 --> 24:56.622
- But you want to say it.
- I certainly do not.

24:56.622 --> 24:59.166
Go ahead. Say it.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.920
Tell me how you really feel.

25:03.504 --> 25:05.714
Fine. I do not think you should marry him.

25:05.714 --> 25:06.840
See, I knew it.

25:06.840 --> 25:11.303
If. If he does not make you ecstatically,
over-the-moon happy.

25:11.303 --> 25:12.930
Do you know what I see?

25:12.930 --> 25:17.809
He's a tech enthusiast, while
you dislike anything made after 1985.

25:17.809 --> 25:21.188
He goes to sleep when children do,
while you are a night owl.

25:21.855 --> 25:28.195
And I heard you closed your antique booth,
but you love your antique booth.

25:28.195 --> 25:30.948
It's just temporary.
Just until after the wedding.

25:30.948 --> 25:34.826
I fear you have made your life a part
of his while he has not done the same.

25:35.327 --> 25:36.328
And...

25:37.996 --> 25:40.332
I want so much more than that for you.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.418
<i>I was pretty shaken up.</i>

25:43.418 --> 25:45.963
<i>I feared Zoë was right about me.
About Edgar.</i>

25:47.840 --> 25:50.092
<i>And then you put the vow box
over our heads.</i>

25:52.469 --> 25:56.098
Isn't this nice?
Just our two heads in a box.

26:01.228 --> 26:02.396
"My dearest Grace.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.107
- You fit so perfectly into my life--"
- No--

26:06.358 --> 26:07.693
What are you doing?

26:07.693 --> 26:11.613
On our first date, you said to me
that I brought something out of you.

26:13.156 --> 26:15.117
The thing is
I don't know if I actually have.

26:15.701 --> 26:18.328
But I do want to. Desperately.

26:20.205 --> 26:23.625
So don't read. Just tell me how you feel.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.420
From your heart.

26:29.965 --> 26:34.845
Grace. I know I do things a certain way.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.556
I'm strange.

26:38.974 --> 26:43.687
But I thought I would spend
my dotage with puzzles as my only company.

26:44.563 --> 26:47.024
But now you're the only puzzle
I want to solve.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.030
You make me want to change.

26:53.572 --> 26:56.241
<i>I don't know if it was exactly
what I wanted to hear,</i>

26:56.241 --> 26:59.161
<i>but for Edgar, it was goddamn Shakespeare.</i>

26:59.161 --> 27:00.829
God, I love this box.

27:02.748 --> 27:03.665
Edgar.

27:04.166 --> 27:05.667
Let me take a photo too.

27:06.543 --> 27:07.920
Mrs. Minnows.

27:10.088 --> 27:13.008
So, what music will be
accompanying your first dance?

27:13.008 --> 27:15.969
You and I both know Edgar does not dance
in front of others.

27:15.969 --> 27:18.222
But it is a tradition.

27:18.931 --> 27:21.975
A sacred sacrament.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.353
These things are so important.

27:25.270 --> 27:27.105
Do you not desire a first dance?

27:28.524 --> 27:30.567
No, I do. I desire one indeed.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.736
Then you must have one.

27:37.115 --> 27:40.077
I would like for us
to have a first dance as husband and wife.

27:41.203 --> 27:43.330
But that would
make me quite uncomfortable.

27:44.122 --> 27:47.084
You said that I make you want to change.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.587
Well, this is my first request.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.258
And it's that important to you?

27:57.970 --> 28:00.222
Very well. We shall dance.

28:01.348 --> 28:03.392
- Can we use the vow box?
- No vow box.

28:13.861 --> 28:17.030
Hey, just look at me, okay?

28:18.866 --> 28:21.410
Nobody else matters. It's just us.

28:24.246 --> 28:25.831
Left foot forward,

28:25.831 --> 28:28.166
right foot forward, side.

29:03.702 --> 29:05.913
Roxana. I must go.

29:15.547 --> 29:16.840
I think I know this step.

29:22.971 --> 29:25.432
Follow my lead. I like to dance fast.

29:33.232 --> 29:35.275
<i>I was so embarrassed.</i>

29:35.275 --> 29:37.861
<i>But fortunately,
in one of Funcle Ulysses' previous lives,</i>

29:37.861 --> 29:39.404
<i>he was a professional dancer.</i>

29:49.873 --> 29:50.874
Wow.

29:51.834 --> 29:57.631
He is really just
laying there all not alive.

29:57.631 --> 30:00.843
Just giving me flashbacks
of when I found my GamGam.

30:00.843 --> 30:04.763
Hey! Do not touch anything.
This is a crime scene.

30:04.763 --> 30:06.223
Now help me flip him.

30:06.223 --> 30:08.475
The body? The dead body?

30:08.475 --> 30:11.478
We need to check his pockets for clues,
which we can't do if he's face down.

30:11.478 --> 30:12.771
So get it together.

30:14.189 --> 30:16.358
- One.
- This is for GamGam.

30:16.358 --> 30:18.777
- Two. Three.
- One, two, three.

30:19.695 --> 30:20.779
Stop.

30:22.364 --> 30:23.991
I've looked at his eyes!

30:23.991 --> 30:25.784
Okay, I am going to...

30:26.869 --> 30:29.746
No! Hey! No, don't touch him!
What did you--

30:29.746 --> 30:31.623
Will you just shut up and help me?

30:32.666 --> 30:35.419
Phone. Okay, breath mints.

30:35.919 --> 30:39.590
Oh, God, a lip balm.

30:41.466 --> 30:43.594
- Prescription for Adderall?
- Come on.

30:44.219 --> 30:45.470
What is this?

30:45.470 --> 30:49.349
Looks like a cuff link,
but there's only one of them.

30:50.517 --> 30:53.896
And he's already wearing cuff links, so...

30:55.105 --> 30:56.690
Wait, a smartwatch.

30:56.690 --> 30:59.693
Hey. These things can
track your heartbeat, right?

30:59.693 --> 31:01.278
- Yeah.
- So, if we unlock the phone,

31:01.278 --> 31:03.322
maybe we can figure out the time of death.

31:03.822 --> 31:05.449
I'm way ahead of you.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.327
And shit!

31:09.077 --> 31:11.747
We got locked out.
Just gotta wait, like, five minutes.

31:11.747 --> 31:13.040
Travis.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.626
- We can use Face ID.
- Yeah, but you closed his eyes.

31:16.210 --> 31:18.003
Well, we gotta get them open again.

31:19.046 --> 31:21.840
When Edgar came back,
did you ask him where he ran off to?

31:21.840 --> 31:24.468
No. I'm sure it was some business meeting
or something.

31:24.468 --> 31:26.678
I was just mad that he left me. Again.

31:27.262 --> 31:31.808
And then at 9:50 p.m. like clockwork...

31:34.603 --> 31:39.691
My dear, my CBC regimen demands
that I retire for the evening.

31:39.691 --> 31:42.528
I thought you might say that.
But it's our wedding evening.

31:42.528 --> 31:44.238
We should spend the night together.

31:44.238 --> 31:47.115
So, I have a proposition for you.

31:48.659 --> 31:49.952
Adderall?

31:49.952 --> 31:53.247
Come now, you little silly Billy tweaker.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.791
- You know I don't take pharmaceuticals.
- Remember New Year's Eve?

31:55.791 --> 31:57.751
I gave you one,
and we had the most wonderful night.

31:57.751 --> 32:00.879
I was up till 5:00 a.m. playing
Connect Four against myself.

32:00.879 --> 32:03.757
And the sportsmanship was horrendous.
Never again.

32:05.133 --> 32:07.010
Everyone, your attention please.

32:07.010 --> 32:10.305
It's time for the evening's grand finale,

32:10.305 --> 32:13.684
in which you drive in your cars back
to your own houses.

32:15.352 --> 32:17.062
Go home, please.

32:19.731 --> 32:25.195
For those of you staying on premises,
after-party in the library!

32:27.698 --> 32:31.243
What are you lot cheering for?
None of you are invited.

32:31.243 --> 32:35.873
Dearest, we can't not attend
our own after-party. One more drink?

32:37.374 --> 32:40.544
Very well. One more drink. Then to bed.

32:41.211 --> 32:42.296
That's wonderful.

32:42.796 --> 32:44.798
Hello. A rosé please.

32:44.798 --> 32:47.176
- And a whiskey for my husband.
- Sure thing.

32:50.512 --> 32:51.513
I got it.

32:53.307 --> 32:55.893
<i>But I wanted more than one drink.</i>

32:56.476 --> 32:59.771
<i>I wanted to be together
and to know that we'd be okay.</i>

32:59.771 --> 33:02.191
<i>And Edgar said that he wanted
to change, so...</i>

33:02.983 --> 33:04.902
<i>I'm not proud of it, but...</i>

33:04.902 --> 33:08.739
- You drugged his drink.
- I put Adderall in his drink. Not poison.

33:09.448 --> 33:11.783
Which he had taken before
and no ill effect, so...

33:12.284 --> 33:16.580
<i>Everything seemed perfectly fine.
Even Isabel was kind of nice to me.</i>

33:16.580 --> 33:19.041
Welcome to the family. Such as it is.

33:19.958 --> 33:20.959
Thank you.

33:25.589 --> 33:29.218
I know what you've done.
And I won't let you do it to Grace.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.095
- You're going to die tonight!
- Oh, my God.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.472
Travis.

33:33.472 --> 33:35.682
No. Let's just be serious.

33:35.682 --> 33:37.392
You all are demons.

33:38.310 --> 33:42.606
Each and every one of you is a demon.

33:42.606 --> 33:43.982
Be demons.

33:44.566 --> 33:46.193
- Demons say, "What?"
- What?

33:46.193 --> 33:48.820
"What?" Fie!

33:49.446 --> 33:52.658
- Cerberus bounding at the gates of hell.
- Honey.

33:52.658 --> 33:54.576
- You're all demons.
- Hey.

33:54.576 --> 33:57.204
- You're all a bunch of demons.
- Hey.

33:57.204 --> 33:58.705
It can't be hell,

33:58.705 --> 34:00.749
- because you're a fucking angel.
- Hey. Yeah.

34:00.749 --> 34:03.794
<i>I don't know how he got so drunk,
but I knew I had to get him to bed.</i>

34:03.794 --> 34:05.295
It's getting late, isn't it, huh?

34:05.295 --> 34:07.464
I believe it's time
to bid you all good night.

34:07.464 --> 34:08.590
- Oh, sweetie.
- Good night.

34:08.590 --> 34:12.719
I'm not sad,
I was fucking with you. Assholes.

34:13.303 --> 34:15.304
They're a cute couple, aren't they?

34:18.891 --> 34:20.435
I'm not really one for tradition,

34:20.435 --> 34:24.188
but you are supposed
to carry me over the threshold.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.733
I'm not a slut.

34:30.612 --> 34:31.612
Bao bing.

34:38.620 --> 34:39.663
I love you...

34:41.415 --> 34:42.416
Roxana.

34:47.880 --> 34:52.426
So I slept in my wedding dress.
Not that I got much sleep.

34:52.426 --> 34:54.303
And the next morning...

35:02.728 --> 35:04.479
Edgar. Alarm.

35:08.317 --> 35:11.486
I don't care how hungover you are,
you must hear that thing.

35:13.488 --> 35:15.991
What of your bio-whatevers? You must wake!

35:19.995 --> 35:20.996
Edgar.

35:30.506 --> 35:32.299
And that's all I remember.

35:32.299 --> 35:36.011
Why was Travis the first one to the door?
Wasn't he staying at the hotel?

35:36.011 --> 35:37.346
I don't know.

35:37.346 --> 35:41.808
Thank you for being so honest with us,
Grace. We've got all we need.

35:46.855 --> 35:49.483
So? I mean, she's in the clear, right?

35:49.983 --> 35:51.443
I mean, she gave him Adderall.

35:51.443 --> 35:53.862
That makes you stay awake,
not pass out dead.

35:53.862 --> 35:57.658
Or she put something else in his drink,
and she lied to us about the Adderall.

35:57.658 --> 36:00.118
We need to figure out
what actually killed him.

36:00.118 --> 36:03.872
Maybe we should talk to the ex-boyfriend
who told Edgar he was going to die.

36:04.373 --> 36:06.542
- Vomit's rising. I don't wanna puke.
- Bring it closer.

36:06.542 --> 36:08.627
- Bring it closer to his face.
- I'm gonna puke all over his chest.

36:08.627 --> 36:09.962
What the fuck?

36:11.463 --> 36:12.464
Hey, guys.

36:13.173 --> 36:17.261
We were just trying
to figure out his time of d--

36:17.261 --> 36:18.679
- Travis?
- Let me grab his head.

36:18.679 --> 36:21.223
Okay, we were just trying
to figure out his time of death

36:21.223 --> 36:25.477
- by using the Health app on his phone.
- Yeah.

36:25.477 --> 36:26.562
If we could...

36:28.230 --> 36:30.816
figure that out,
it might tell us when his heart stopped.

36:30.816 --> 36:33.193
- This is a crime scene.
- That's right.

36:35.195 --> 36:37.239
So when you're done doing
what you're doing,

36:37.239 --> 36:39.658
just put the body back
the way that you found it.

36:39.658 --> 36:41.577
- What?
- What do I care?

36:41.577 --> 36:42.995
I'm not a cop anymore.

36:45.205 --> 36:48.458
But I do know a suspect when I see one.

36:48.458 --> 36:51.378
Well, you-- We didn't do anything.
We were trying to help stuff.

36:51.378 --> 36:54.006
We heard you and Edgar
had a little argument.

36:54.006 --> 36:55.799
No. And I barely knew him.

37:02.222 --> 37:04.016
I can explain.

37:04.016 --> 37:05.184
Can you?
