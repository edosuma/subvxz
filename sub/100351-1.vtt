WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(liquid pours)

00:08.943 --> 00:09.675
(clink)

00:15.516 --> 00:18.384
(movie projector whirring)
- Take one.

00:18.386 --> 00:21.053
(upbeat music)

00:33.501 --> 00:36.402
(orchestra music)

03:38.686 --> 03:43.755
(drill banging)
(drill whirring)

03:52.233 --> 03:54.499
- What are you worried about?

03:54.501 --> 03:56.201
- I'm not worried
about anything.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.302
I'm just hungry.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.375
Why are we here now?

04:05.913 --> 04:07.879
I didn't know mechanics
were open this late.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.783
- We changed the oil right
here three months ago.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.885
- I wasn't with you.
- Where were you?

04:15.189 --> 04:17.755
- With the kids, I don't know.

04:21.528 --> 04:22.794
- You're not nervous?

04:24.164 --> 04:25.897
- What do I have to
be nervous about?

04:25.899 --> 04:28.834
The mechanic's gonna find
something wrong with the car?

04:28.836 --> 04:32.671
- You heard me tell Pete,
"Just change the oil."

04:32.673 --> 04:35.474
- The neighbor girl's gonna
forget to feed the kids?

04:35.476 --> 04:38.810
- Cindy may be a little
loopy, but she's not a ditz.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.245
- What are you--

04:40.247 --> 04:41.313
That's the same thing.

04:48.289 --> 04:50.656
- Don't you have any change?

04:50.658 --> 04:51.923
Go get something to eat.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.060
- The machine out there works?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.561
- Yes, I don't know.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.064
Go see.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.566
- I'm not that hungry.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.376
Is there a particular time
your brother's expecting us?

05:14.515 --> 05:17.316
I am hungry, I just
figure I'll wait

05:17.318 --> 05:18.917
if it's not gonna be that long.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.493
I think I'm just restless.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.396
(orchestra music)

05:41.842 --> 05:43.075
- [Reporter] Today,
the TSA has issued

05:43.077 --> 05:45.077
a statement addressing
the states proposal

05:45.079 --> 05:46.812
for drone traffic regulations.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.947
Drone delivery companies
are now required

05:48.949 --> 05:52.117
to regulate speeds to
under 20 miles per hour.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.019
- I'm worried about him.
- Why?

05:55.122 --> 05:56.521
- I don't think
he gets out much.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.925
- Should the check oil light
still supposed to be on?

05:59.927 --> 06:01.727
- [Brooke] I told
you it's always on.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.228
- You told me, but did
you tell the mechanic?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.463
That's why he's there.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.564
- Yeah, I told him
like two times ago.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.099
It's not doing any harm.

06:07.101 --> 06:08.600
- Well, it's weird and annoying.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.102
We just came from his place--

06:10.104 --> 06:12.404
- Michael, you don't drive
this car, so who cares?

06:13.841 --> 06:15.273
Please, just drive.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.608
- So, is this a fancy
dinner party we're going to?

06:16.610 --> 06:18.543
Should we bring a
bottle of wine, dessert?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.612
- Why don't you
remember people's names?

06:21.515 --> 06:22.814
The mechanic's name is Pete.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.549
Is that so hard to remember?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.485
- [Michael] Maybe something
fancy like a Sherry.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.121
A nice port.
- Oh shit, we missed it.

06:29.123 --> 06:30.455
Turn around, we missed it.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.690
- What did we miss?

06:31.692 --> 06:32.824
- Shun Lee Palace, we're
getting Chinese food.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.693
- Are you kidding me?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.595
There's no dinner
party, is there?

06:36.597 --> 06:39.064
Just us bringing your
brother dinner again

06:40.334 --> 06:44.202
like a couple of assholes.
- Oh, god, please.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.737
You love Chinese food.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.074
- Yeah, I love Chinese food.
- He, he loves Chinese food.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.309
We're going to see him,
so what matters is that

06:51.311 --> 06:52.477
he loves Chinese food.
- He loves Chinese food?

06:52.479 --> 06:54.880
He does not love the drop in.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.348
No one loves a drop in--

06:56.350 --> 06:58.216
- It's not a drop in.
- Least of all,

06:58.218 --> 06:59.951
your little brother.
- Well, he knows,

06:59.953 --> 07:01.253
he knows we're
coming, don't worry.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.821
- [Michael] Bullshit,
I call bullshit.

07:02.823 --> 07:06.858
I bet you $100 right now he
has no idea we're dropping by.

07:07.828 --> 07:12.898
(gentle music)
(Drew moaning)

07:15.969 --> 07:21.039
(knocking on door)
(gentle music)

07:26.079 --> 07:27.345
- Jesus, I'm coming.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.982
(knocking on door)

07:30.984 --> 07:31.883
What the hell?

07:36.089 --> 07:37.355
- [Brooke] "What the hell?"

07:37.357 --> 07:39.458
Don't "what the hell" to me.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.627
What, I can't drop in to
see my little brother?

07:42.629 --> 07:45.030
- [Michael] Sorry, I didn't
know it was a drop in.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.468
- [Brooke] Who cares
if it is a drop in?

07:49.470 --> 07:52.170
I can stop by to
see my little bro.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.973
What are you, a hot shot
now, Mr. Wall Street?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.241
- What am I on suicide watch?

07:56.243 --> 07:58.176
You couldn't just pick
up the phone and say,

07:58.178 --> 07:59.478
"Hey Drew, how are you today?

07:59.480 --> 08:00.412
"How are you feeling?

08:00.414 --> 08:01.680
"Have you gotten over the girl

08:01.682 --> 08:03.114
"that ditched you
for an eMate yet?"

08:03.116 --> 08:05.784
- Oh, don't even dare
remind me about that sexbot.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.986
- Sexbot?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.321
Wow, you are old school.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.522
They're eMates, Brooke,

08:10.524 --> 08:11.556
and how are you going
to blame a machine

08:11.558 --> 08:12.791
on the end of my relationship?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.292
- Listen, you are
a fool for thinking

08:14.294 --> 08:17.262
that I give a shit about a
machine with an artificial heart

08:17.264 --> 08:20.265
that walks around
stealing human souls.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.467
- Okay, can we get back to the
reason you're here right now?

08:22.469 --> 08:24.236
I have plans, you know.

08:24.238 --> 08:25.737
- Masturbating to a video game?

08:25.739 --> 08:28.240
That can wait, can't it?
- Brooke, come on.

08:28.242 --> 08:30.308
- What, does he look
like he's going out?

08:30.310 --> 08:31.810
- Whether I go out or
not is my business.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.078
I can still have plans.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.114
- I brought you your favorite,

08:36.116 --> 08:38.650
Kung Pao chicken with a
shrimp egg roll and a Coke.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.888
- From Shun Lee Palace?
- Yeah.

08:44.491 --> 08:48.026
- They're good.
- Did you see my white rice?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.095
- Did you get white rice?

08:50.097 --> 08:52.230
- Yes, because I
always get white rice.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.733
- Keep looking then.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.902
- I'm looking, and
I'm not seeing it.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.670
- Maybe they screwed up.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.038
- Well, it's not here.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.306
- Yeah, they screwed up.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.775
- Goddammit.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.477
- Just treat this
as your me meal.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.312
Have some fried rice.
- No,

09:07.314 --> 09:10.081
because it's gross and
greasy and disgusting.

09:12.986 --> 09:16.821
- Baby, what, what
are you doing here?

09:16.823 --> 09:18.223
- Hi, Sugar, what's keeping you?

09:18.225 --> 09:21.426
- Um, my sister popped in.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.395
Uninvited.
- How lovely.

09:23.397 --> 09:27.065
- No, it's not lovely
at all actually, because

09:27.067 --> 09:30.502
we had those plans, um, that
we were going to go out.

09:30.504 --> 09:33.204
- So, great, let's
go out all together.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.906
We can, we can go to the movies.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.510
- But then you had to lie down
and rest in peace and quiet.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.312
- Yes, it got much worse.

09:40.314 --> 09:42.480
I had come out for
some fresh air.

09:42.482 --> 09:43.982
- For a headache.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.318
You just take a drop of honey,
stir it in a glass of water.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.352
- No water. (chuckles)

09:47.354 --> 09:48.520
- Well, no, don't be ridiculous

09:48.522 --> 09:49.454
'cause we're mostly
made of water,

09:49.456 --> 09:50.689
so you could just be dehydrated.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.190
But it's the honey
that does the trick.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.558
You got some honey?
- No, no, no.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.826
- Just put some water
on the towelette--

09:54.828 --> 09:56.194
- Please, please, stop, stop.

09:56.196 --> 10:00.832
- I took something, and
I drank plenty of water.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.667
- See, (chuckles) she
took something already.

10:02.669 --> 10:06.071
- You know, pharmaceuticals
are bad for the body.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.839
- Sorry, um, what's your name?

10:09.376 --> 10:12.043
- I'll handle this, just go
rest on the bed, will you?

10:12.045 --> 10:12.944
Thanks.

10:18.552 --> 10:19.985
I was trying to tell you.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.520
- No, you were not trying
to tell me anything.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.356
- I thought it was obvious
that I didn't want you to stay.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.091
- Yeah, there is a
woman in your apartment,

10:26.093 --> 10:27.459
and you don't have
the common decency

10:27.461 --> 10:29.227
to tell me that you're
seeing somebody?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.962
- Okay, not everything
is your business.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.230
- Are you guys an item?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.833
- You know, get yourself
some raw, organic honey.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.068
You'll never go to
the drug store again.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.603
- I can't.
- Okay, look.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.039
I really appreciate the food,
but obviously I'm doing fine.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.207
- Lavender oil.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.242
That works well, too.
- Just, just...

10:44.244 --> 10:45.777
Obviously you're not fine,

10:45.779 --> 10:47.879
because you're not telling
me anything about her,

10:47.881 --> 10:49.547
and for all I know
she could be a

10:52.386 --> 10:53.251
fling.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.357
- Okay, you know what,
it doesn't matter
what she is to me.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.559
She could be a
fling, a roommate,

11:01.561 --> 11:03.094
my eloped wife, or an escort.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.296
It wouldn't justify you
barging in here uninvited.

11:07.734 --> 11:08.600
- Drew?

11:09.603 --> 11:11.269
- What, why are we whispering?

11:11.271 --> 11:12.470
- Yo, dude.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.873
Your friend.

11:14.875 --> 11:15.940
- Yeah, oh right.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.510
The headache.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.211
Yeah.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.921
- Here.

11:29.923 --> 11:30.822
Eat.

11:38.065 --> 11:38.963
So.

11:39.866 --> 11:40.765
She's an escort.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.301
I'm just kidding.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.137
- No one can tell
when you're kidding.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.039
- Yeah, that's the point.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.076
- No, kidding is supposed
to be playful and innocent.

11:51.078 --> 11:54.646
- Yeah, that's what I do.
- No, you do it wrong.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.650
- [Michael] Do you
get headaches often?

11:58.652 --> 11:59.517
- [Quin] I don't know.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.518
It's up to Drew.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.822
- [Michael] And how is that?

12:03.824 --> 12:06.491
- [Quin] He's in charge,
whatever he says goes.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.360
- [Michael] I don't think
you're hearing me right.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.896
- Are you a doctor?
- No.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.099
I just like to study
the human body.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.868
How it works, how
it heals itself.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.670
I'm actually in video
game development.

12:18.672 --> 12:19.904
Started my own company.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.842
I guess you can say I'm into
creating artificial life.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.044
- [Quin] What a coincidence.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.313
That's my entire existence.
- Oh, really?

12:28.315 --> 12:29.981
You're a gamer?
- Somewhat.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.016
I'm mostly into stimulation,

12:32.018 --> 12:33.985
but also entertainment
in general.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.487
- [Michael] You mean simulation.

12:35.489 --> 12:36.955
Yeah, just go ahead and
pull your hair to the side

12:36.957 --> 12:37.856
for a second.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.558
Yeah, try one more thing.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.460
Okay, ready?

12:43.897 --> 12:46.064
A little pressure
there, might hurt.

12:49.803 --> 12:50.702
Holy shit.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.138
Holy shit.

12:55.041 --> 12:55.940
Oh shit!

12:56.910 --> 12:58.276
- You stay there.
- Shit!

12:59.579 --> 13:01.613
- [Brooke] What,
what's happening?

13:01.615 --> 13:04.249
- Okay, stay calm
and don't panic.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.252
- That's a sexbot.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.520
- eMate.
- She's a sexbot!

13:08.522 --> 13:10.822
It's a computer!

13:10.824 --> 13:12.891
- [Brooke] Guys,
what's going on?

13:12.893 --> 13:15.660
- Nothing, it's just a--
- It's a bug.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.129
- Big bug, it scared
Quin, and she yelled.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.833
- That was Michael who yelled.
- Big fuckin' bug, Brooke.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.802
- [Brooke] Oh, gross.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.170
- Please don't tell my sister.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.338
- What the hell, man!

13:27.340 --> 13:29.274
- She's not going to
understand, and she's gonna be

13:29.276 --> 13:30.208
on my ass forever.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.142
- I'm not making any guarantees,

13:31.144 --> 13:32.343
I wanna get out of this room.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.946
- You can't leave
unless you promise me.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.314
- Fuck, she looks so real.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.884
- She is real.
- No, real, like a,

13:40.887 --> 13:42.020
like a human.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.256
- Okay I got it.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.959
I will put $10,000
into your company

13:47.961 --> 13:50.795
if you promise not to
tell Brooke about Quin.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.696
- Who's Quin.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.567
Oh, yeah, right.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.535
- [Brook] So, are
you guys killing it?

13:58.839 --> 13:59.737
- Well?

14:00.807 --> 14:02.707
- You'll invest
10K in the company?

14:02.709 --> 14:04.676
- Yeah, of course.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.644
I like what you guys
are doing anyway.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.013
Shake on it?

14:11.985 --> 14:12.851
Deal.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.453
Now will you please
persuade your wife

14:15.455 --> 14:17.155
to get the hell out
of my apartment?

14:17.157 --> 14:18.723
- Yeah, I think I can do that.

14:19.593 --> 14:23.094
Oh fuck. (breathes deeply)

14:23.897 --> 14:26.898
(orchestra music)

14:30.704 --> 14:32.003
Brooke.

14:32.005 --> 14:32.837
Brooke.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.005
We gotta go.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.139
I'm sorry, she's
throwing up in there.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.374
I don't--
- There's...

14:36.376 --> 14:38.042
There's just too much
going on right now.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.979
- Yeah, the migraines,
and it's really gross.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.547
Come on, we gotta go.
- Talk to your friend.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.816
- Yeah, we'll talk to her
later, we'll give her a

14:44.818 --> 14:46.017
get wall card, come on.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.052
Enjoy the Chinese, thank you.
- Call me.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.020
- She'll call you.

14:51.791 --> 14:52.690
- You call me.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.826
You call me.

14:54.828 --> 14:57.462
(upbeat music)

15:02.469 --> 15:04.502
- [Quin] Why does
Brooke talk different?

15:05.538 --> 15:06.771
- She was adopted.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.375
Let's go back to bed.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.011
(mellow music)

15:25.892 --> 15:28.026
- [Michael] You want
to fool around tonight?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.929
- Eh, it depends.
- Oh, it depends?

15:32.499 --> 15:34.999
- [Brooke] Yeah, let's see
if the kids will go to bed.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.135
If not, maybe they
can watch a movie.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.608
- [Michael] Well we
can do something.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.177
It's still early.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.279
We have the neighbor
girl till 10, right?

15:49.649 --> 15:50.615
Go see a movie.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.750
Go get dessert somewhere.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.053
Have a drink.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.659
- [Brooke] Was there something

16:01.661 --> 16:03.728
weird about that girl?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.430
- [Michael] Quin.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.031
- Quin?
- Quin.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.766
- [Brooke] That's her name?

16:08.768 --> 16:10.535
- [Michael] Yeah, Quin.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.737
- [Brooke] So, was
there something weird?

16:13.606 --> 16:14.872
- [Michael] (chuckling) Yeah.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.943
I mean, there was something.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.179
I can't put my finger on it.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.247
Something weird.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.321
- [Brooke] Whatever he's
doing is not healthy.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.992
I think I'm going
see him more often

16:33.994 --> 16:36.427
and take him out
of that apartment.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.402
Quin?

16:46.473 --> 16:47.155
- [Michael] Weird.

16:47.156 --> 16:47.838
- [Brooke] How come
you remember her name,

16:47.841 --> 16:49.841
you only saw her
for like 20 seconds.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.376
You don't even remember
the name of the girl

16:51.378 --> 16:52.844
who's watching our kids?

16:55.281 --> 16:57.315
Or the guy who is
taking care of our cars?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.817
- [Michael It's a unique Name.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.552
Quin, I don't know.

17:05.759 --> 17:10.828
(mellow music)
(people chatting)

17:11.731 --> 17:13.064
- [Drew] That's the place.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.933
- And what is this?

17:15.935 --> 17:17.502
- It's a manufacturing parlor.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.539
Dude, how old are you?

17:21.540 --> 17:22.973
Parlor's aren't new.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.076
eMates have been around.
- Yeah, I'm not that old dude.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.011
I've just never
hung out with one.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.479
- Or had sex with one.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.014
- Right.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.917
- Well, don't tell my sister
you're researching eMates.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.186
I don't care that it's for the
new game you're developing,

17:35.188 --> 17:37.188
don't even mention
Butterfly Chasers.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.423
Don't let her find that card.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.391
She'll fuckin' kill
you, research or not.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.494
- So you can own one?

17:45.732 --> 17:49.067
- Own, lease, rent, whatever.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.501
It's like a car.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.736
A smart car.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.137
They're programmed to
know what you want,

17:53.139 --> 17:55.640
exactly what's expected of them.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.475
They're complete subordinates.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.043
But they don't complain,
they don't argue,

17:59.045 --> 18:03.081
they don't manipulate,
they just love.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.350
Unless you want them
to complain, or argue,

18:06.352 --> 18:07.452
or manipulate you.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.754
Because you can program them.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.855
- You program them?

18:10.857 --> 18:12.690
- Well, the manufacturer.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.526
I'm sure it's way
too complicated for
the average consumer.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.061
For them, it's easy.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.529
I can call BC up right now

18:18.531 --> 18:21.632
and ask for a new program
for Quin if I wanted.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.467
A new personality.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.701
A new voice, even.

18:25.004 --> 18:28.005
They just open their laptop,
login, switch it out.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.507
That's it.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.342
You can understand all that.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.910
Your industry is all
about technology.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.012
- So, hold on, so,

18:35.014 --> 18:36.981
are you saying that there are

18:36.983 --> 18:42.053
sexbots just like
walking around, like
moving in the public?

18:44.057 --> 18:47.625
- I mean, not a ton, but
yeah, they're out there.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.994
And most of them are supervised.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.529
- Supervised?

18:51.531 --> 18:53.164
- (chuckling) Yeah,
man, there are rules.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.198
- Okay, like what?

18:55.268 --> 18:57.768
- Come on, it's
like obvious stuff.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.606
Your eMate can't handle
money, at least not in public.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.641
They can't apply for a job.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.477
They're not supposed to
be unsupervised, although,

19:06.479 --> 19:09.547
that can be kind of hard to
follow when you're role playing.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.683
You wanna do some research, man?

19:12.685 --> 19:14.285
Check out the parlor.

19:14.287 --> 19:17.588
It's kind of on the down
low, because of some people

19:18.458 --> 19:19.524
like my sister.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.392
- Okay, but,

19:23.163 --> 19:24.896
Butterfly Chasers, what does...

19:26.266 --> 19:28.099
What's that got to
do with sexbots?

19:29.469 --> 19:30.368
- Think about it.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.503
What's it feel like

19:32.505 --> 19:34.605
when you first meet
someone you really like?

19:36.109 --> 19:37.608
- I don't know.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.044
- Feels like butterflies in
your stomach, doesn't it?

19:40.046 --> 19:41.012
- Yeah, right.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.115
- Michael, they're
eMates, not sexbots.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.052
Get the lingo, man.

19:48.054 --> 19:48.953
Get the lingo.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.956
(people chatting)

19:56.996 --> 19:58.262
- [David] I'm not lying.

19:58.264 --> 20:00.064
- [Drew] Dude, you
always lie to me.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.666
Why wouldn't you
be lying to me now?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.267
- [David] Because I'm
telling you, it's true.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.202
- [Drew] It's not true.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.170
What's true is you're a douche.

20:06.172 --> 20:09.273
- (laughs) Yeah, yeah,
that might also true

20:09.275 --> 20:11.409
but in this
particular situation,

20:11.411 --> 20:13.144
why can't both of them be true?

20:13.146 --> 20:15.346
- They can be, but they aren't.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.682
My fuckin' ex is not
in the United States,

20:17.684 --> 20:20.284
so there's no fuckin' way that
you saw her at the movies.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.220
- Ah, except that I did see her.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.955
I saw her in plain sight,

20:23.957 --> 20:26.490
with her arm around
her eMate chimp.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.492
- So she didn't go to Paris?

20:28.494 --> 20:32.096
She went to the movies instead,
with Cameron, is that right?

20:32.098 --> 20:33.998
- Look, it was her
and Cameron alright.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.434
I know that fricking
sexbot from anywhere.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.536
You remember you
made me stalk them

20:38.538 --> 20:39.870
for like a week straight?

20:41.007 --> 20:44.475
- So, shit, wait,
you're fuckin' serious?

20:44.477 --> 20:47.845
She was at IFC with Cameron?
- Yes, I'm serious.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.480
Look, man, I'm sorry, but
what am I supposed to do,

20:49.482 --> 20:51.816
not tell you, lie
to you, come on.

20:51.818 --> 20:55.653
- So, what, she lied to
me to break up with me?

20:56.556 --> 20:59.156
- Eh, I mean, not necessarily.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.858
Maybe, uh...

21:00.860 --> 21:02.293
Maybe she lost her scholarship.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.629
Fuck, maybe she just
hated Paris, who knows.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.964
- Maybe she came
back for Cameron.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.132
- That's fucking gross.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.934
Jesus, you think...

21:09.936 --> 21:12.603
You think she's in love
with a fuckin' machine?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.038
- Why not, he's perfect.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.641
Fuck.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.776
- All right, all right, well,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.478
you get me Chinese
food for a week,

21:20.480 --> 21:22.179
and I'll find out
what's going on.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.314
- Get the fuck out of here.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.582
Your lazy ass ain't doing shit.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.916
You're just gonna
sit here all week

21:25.918 --> 21:27.318
and make up a story at the end.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.519
- What, fuck you.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.355
- Fuck your mother.
- Really?

21:31.357 --> 21:32.590
I'm gonna go fuck your sister.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.724
I'm gonna get her
number, hold up.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.293
- Hey.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.193
Look,

21:37.163 --> 21:38.729
seriously, though.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.265
You get me tickets to
Tokyo's Revenge this month,

21:41.267 --> 21:43.868
and I'll find out what's going
on with your ex, I swear.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.102
- They're playing here?

21:45.104 --> 21:46.504
- Yeah, they're
playing here, man.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.105
- Who you going with?
- (laughs) Fuck you, asshole.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.373
- Hey.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.242
- Unless your sister's
available, of course.

21:51.244 --> 21:54.278
Fuck off.
(David laughs)

22:00.486 --> 22:01.419
- These are great.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.890
I mean, you're
nailing it, the...

22:05.892 --> 22:10.161
The detail in the clothes,
it's like a hard casing.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.429
These are ready to go digital.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.797
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.899
This is phenomenal Reign.
- Well, great.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.734
That's what we talked about.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.070
- I gotta come clean.

22:20.540 --> 22:24.175
I'm struggling a little bit
with some of the storylines.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.343
All right, and I thought
I'd have little more

22:25.345 --> 22:26.544
for you this week, but,

22:29.382 --> 22:30.281
I don't.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.685
- I mean, we have people
interested in our concept.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.953
- I know.

22:35.955 --> 22:36.887
- Two different companies.
- I know.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.189
- Got windows wide open for us.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.623
- Rei.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.125
- The gaming industry
doesn't just sit around and

22:41.127 --> 22:43.194
wait for the next best thing.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.795
It scoops up and shits
out the bottom-feeders.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.030
- You don't have
to tell me that.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.265
- (chuckles) If
we don't act fast,

22:49.402 --> 22:51.302
they're just gonna go
with another concept.

22:51.304 --> 22:53.504
Stupider, shittier, ridiculously

22:53.506 --> 22:55.139
fucking inferior concepts.
- Look, I'm not an idiot.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.007
You don't have to tell
me any of this, okay.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.476
I can't help that I'm blocked.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.010
It's not like I'm not trying.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.380
- Do we need to bring
on another story person?

23:02.382 --> 23:03.247
- No.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.316
- You sure?

23:05.318 --> 23:07.351
- Trust me, you don't
want the headache.

23:07.353 --> 23:08.419
- What headache?

23:08.421 --> 23:09.620
- I've been there before, okay.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.188
We bring out another
story person,

23:11.190 --> 23:13.290
they tear apart everything
that works for us so far.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.859
Plus, we have to
negotiate terms,

23:14.861 --> 23:17.495
ownership rights, I
have to like them.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.864
I mean, it'll take longer to
recruit someone than if I--

23:19.866 --> 23:21.399
- Alright, alright, alright.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.401
Now I have the
headache we don't want.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.871
- I'm sorry, all right,
I'm holding us up.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.609
- Is it the kids?

23:31.611 --> 23:32.943
Family life?

23:32.945 --> 23:34.578
- Eh, that's part of it.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.715
- Is it Brooke?
- It's nothing.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.183
I don't know what it is.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.018
- I know, Brooke and I went
to school together, but

23:41.020 --> 23:42.987
we're not as close
as we used to be.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.255
I promise you, we don't around

23:44.257 --> 23:45.689
and gossip about you
behind your back.

23:45.691 --> 23:46.891
- You gotta talk
about something.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.893
- What, the two times
a year I see her?

23:48.895 --> 23:51.495
- Yeah, so you say.
- (chuckles) Right.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.230
So, our whole company
is just a rouse

23:53.232 --> 23:55.466
so I can spy on you
when you're not home.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.202
She pays me very well, too.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.771
- Speaking of money,
I got more capital.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.273
10K from the brother-in-law.

24:03.943 --> 24:08.012
- What, Baby Drew, 21-year-old
stockbroker genius?

24:08.014 --> 24:09.580
- Yeah, he's 25 now,

24:09.582 --> 24:10.881
and he still doesn't know
what to do with his money.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.218
- We don't need more investment.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.586
- I know.

24:15.588 --> 24:16.487
I know.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.322
We need the story.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.058
- [Reign] Oh, shit.

24:21.060 --> 24:25.229
("Carmen WD31: Act I: Habanera")

24:54.193 --> 24:57.728
- [Brooke] (laughing)
What are you doing?

24:57.730 --> 24:58.896
- I wanna play something.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.966
- [Brooke] What?

25:01.968 --> 25:04.702
(clears throat)

25:07.473 --> 25:09.773
- I don't normally hold
auditions after dark.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.010
But I can see that you're

25:13.012 --> 25:16.580
very passionate about
being our voice actor, so

25:17.884 --> 25:20.117
I'm gonna give you a
chance to prove yourself.

25:24.290 --> 25:27.925
(Brooke chuckling quietly)

25:29.262 --> 25:30.794
All of our associates
have left for the evening,

25:30.796 --> 25:34.365
so I hope you don't mind
that it's just you and I.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.799
Amber, is it?

25:37.603 --> 25:39.870
Well, Amber, shall I
tell you what it is

25:39.872 --> 25:41.105
that we're looking for?

25:43.709 --> 25:45.142
- Yes,

25:45.144 --> 25:47.211
please, Mr. Executive.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.714
You know I will do anything.

25:54.253 --> 25:58.088
- Well we're currently
offering $50,000 a contract,

25:59.091 --> 26:00.991
and we're developing
three games.

26:02.361 --> 26:06.430
Now, we need to cast our lead
voice actress very quickly,

26:08.200 --> 26:10.034
so I'll get straight
to the point.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.203
If you want this job,

26:13.205 --> 26:15.205
you're going to have
to do some things.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.976
- I would do anything. (laughs)

26:20.513 --> 26:22.813
- [Michael] Come on,
Brooke, it's not that funny.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.648
- Michael, I don't
want to do this.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.417
- Come on, just try.
- I can't act.

26:26.419 --> 26:27.885
- [Michael] Just do it
like in a different voice,

26:27.887 --> 26:28.819
or something.
- I am trying.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.287
I'm just going to laugh again.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.926
- Do you want me to just
lie here and say nothing?

26:35.928 --> 26:38.128
- No, I want you to be engaged.

26:44.303 --> 26:47.938
- Where is that coming from?
- I don't know.

26:49.575 --> 26:53.143
I just want to try something
new, something different.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.281
- Honey, I'm sorry,
but it's not me,

26:57.283 --> 27:01.318
and it's not for you either,
it's not us, it's hokey.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.121
And distracting, and I can't
get turned on like that.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.090
- Yeah, you can't
get turned on my be.

27:08.894 --> 27:09.793
- No baby.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.368
I am attracted to you.

27:17.370 --> 27:20.204
You, not some executive
with a big wallet.

27:22.908 --> 27:23.941
Come on.

27:23.943 --> 27:28.078
("Carmen WD31: Act I: Habanera")

28:00.379 --> 28:03.414
(Brooke laughing)

28:03.416 --> 28:07.551
("Carmen WD31: Act I: Habanera")

29:45.651 --> 29:48.452
- I'm sorry, what did
you come by for again?

29:48.454 --> 29:49.386
- Just to talk.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.592
- You wanna see Quin, don't you?

29:55.594 --> 29:56.493
- No.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.232
Not unless you're offering.

30:03.068 --> 30:03.967
- No.

30:10.810 --> 30:15.445
- I guess I just need to go
somewhere to clear my head.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.349
- Okay.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.519
(mellow piano music)

31:42.835 --> 31:45.736
(door bangs shut)

32:12.564 --> 32:15.299
(dramatic music)

35:36.702 --> 35:39.603
(people chatting)

35:48.547 --> 35:50.046
- Leaving so soon, Mr. Green?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.566
- How do you know my name?

36:19.511 --> 36:21.845
- What are you looking for?

36:23.282 --> 36:25.248
- I don't know, I
was just looking.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.518
- Are you looking' for a friend?

36:29.354 --> 36:32.622
- You mean like a robot that,

36:32.624 --> 36:34.858
you know.
- A companion.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.060
- [Michael] Can I have
an evening friend.

36:37.062 --> 36:38.028
- An eMate.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.262
- [Michael] Yeah.

36:39.264 --> 36:40.297
- Yeah?

36:40.299 --> 36:41.264
- [Michael] Yeah.

36:41.266 --> 36:42.532
- Yeah.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.334
- No, I'm, no, I'm
not looking for...

36:46.438 --> 36:49.673
- Well, which one
is it, yes or no?

36:49.675 --> 36:51.608
Did you come in here
for an evening mate,

36:51.610 --> 36:53.877
or you just come to gawk?
- I wasn't gawking,

36:53.879 --> 36:55.445
I was just, I was...

36:56.515 --> 36:57.614
Well, I was curious.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.752
- (chuckles) Well,
why didn't you say so?

37:02.754 --> 37:05.355
There's no harm in
asking questions.

37:05.357 --> 37:06.523
Come,

37:06.525 --> 37:07.424
sit down.

37:08.594 --> 37:09.993
Take a look at what we got.

37:17.302 --> 37:18.235
Explore.

37:19.404 --> 37:20.837
Ask about the specials,

37:20.839 --> 37:23.240
because there's new technology
popping up all the time.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.545
Conversation is free.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.148
And you don't even have
to buy your date a drink.

37:52.704 --> 37:55.538
(dramatic music)

38:34.813 --> 38:36.946
- [Drew] Where is this?

38:36.948 --> 38:38.348
- Mr. Chow.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.215
- Fuck.

38:40.218 --> 38:41.418
- Yeah.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.420
Wait, did you bring the...

38:43.422 --> 38:44.688
Bring the Chinese food?

38:44.690 --> 38:45.889
Bring my Kung Pao chicken?

38:45.891 --> 38:47.557
- She always went for
the classier shit.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.094
Fuckin' Mr. Chow.
- Yeah.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.096
- She always raved
about this place.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.098
Handmade, tossed
noodles or some shit.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.866
- You should have taken her.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.402
- I'm not paying out the ass
for some fucking noodles.

38:59.404 --> 39:02.272
- It's not just
the noodles, man.

39:02.274 --> 39:04.507
It's the fucking, you
know, it's the music,

39:04.509 --> 39:06.876
and it's the decor and it's
the ambiance and all that shit.

39:06.878 --> 39:10.714
It's special, and fucking
chicks dig that shit.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.549
- Yeah, I guess so.
- They want you to

39:12.551 --> 39:14.951
buy them flowers that are just
gonna die in a couple days,

39:14.953 --> 39:16.886
and they want you to
take them on vacations

39:16.888 --> 39:18.355
that are just gonna
tire them out,

39:18.357 --> 39:20.357
and want you to have a
big fucking dick on you

39:20.359 --> 39:22.859
that's gonna hurt when you
try to shove it in them.

39:22.861 --> 39:26.796
But, but they want you to
be the soft, sentimental guy

39:26.798 --> 39:30.033
that remembers birthdays
and anniversaries, and shit.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.369
But then again, if
you're in a bar,

39:32.371 --> 39:34.137
and some dude
looks at her funny,

39:34.139 --> 39:36.906
they want you to be tough
enough to start a fight.

39:36.908 --> 39:40.377
Crazy, they want
everything, man.

39:40.379 --> 39:43.713
(chuckles) It's like
they have this fucking

39:43.715 --> 39:46.850
idealistic perfect view
of what a man should be

39:46.852 --> 39:49.552
in their fricking
heads, and it's...

39:49.554 --> 39:51.054
It's, you know, it's no wonder

39:51.056 --> 39:52.822
fucking Diana ran
off with that...

39:53.692 --> 39:54.591
Whatever.

39:55.427 --> 39:56.326
- What?

39:57.596 --> 39:59.596
- That's it, man, they
just want everything.

39:59.598 --> 40:03.133
- No, you were saying,
no wonder Di ran off.

40:03.135 --> 40:05.802
With Cameron?
- Yeah, yeah.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.604
But whatever, man.
- No, you mean with Cameron.

40:07.606 --> 40:11.107
That's why she ran off with
Cameron because he's an eMate.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.443
Because he's programmed
to be perfect.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.147
- Okay, yeah.

40:17.149 --> 40:20.083
So, so I mean, how are you
supposed to compete with that?

40:20.085 --> 40:22.018
How are we supposed to compete

40:22.020 --> 40:24.487
if this is the world
that we live in?

40:25.857 --> 40:27.223
- I think I understand.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.060
I know why she dumped me.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.533
Because I'm not perfect.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.001
- Yeah, dude, no shit.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.269
What have we been talking
about this whole time.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.637
- I know how I can win her back.

40:40.639 --> 40:41.905
- [David] No, no,
stop, don't start--

40:41.907 --> 40:44.240
- I can win her back
by being better.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.608
- No, you're gone
dude, this is it.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.444
I'm changing the
subject right now.

40:47.446 --> 40:48.411
We're gonna talk about
food, let's get some food.

40:48.413 --> 40:49.913
You hungry?
- I'm serious.

40:49.915 --> 40:52.682
If you can reprogram a machine
to be compatible with you,

40:52.684 --> 40:55.051
then you can reprogram a person.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.820
I can win her back
by being better.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.189
- Better than a machine?

40:59.191 --> 41:00.824
- Well, if not better,

41:00.826 --> 41:02.826
at least as close
as humanly possible.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.261
- Come on, man, look,
Cameron is a machine,

41:05.263 --> 41:07.063
and machines can be perfect.

41:07.065 --> 41:09.032
Humans can't be perfect.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.233
- I disagree.

41:10.235 --> 41:11.701
I don't know that
machines can be perfect,

41:11.703 --> 41:13.837
and I don't know
that humans can't be.

41:13.839 --> 41:14.938
But I can be better.

41:17.075 --> 41:17.974
- Better, huh?

41:21.079 --> 41:23.446
Fuck it, I'll bite, what
are we talking about?

41:26.151 --> 41:27.784
- No offense, man, but

41:27.786 --> 41:30.320
I didn't do anything
but play video games,

41:30.322 --> 41:33.523
eat junk food,
and fuck my robot.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.757
- Sounds pretty, oh
shit, by the way,

41:34.759 --> 41:36.659
did you bring the Kung
Pao chicken or what?

41:38.029 --> 41:39.462
- Are you listening to me?

41:39.464 --> 41:41.464
I just told you how
I can win her back.

41:44.803 --> 41:47.103
- Forgot the food, didn't you?
- Jesus Christ, man.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.905
I'll get your fuckin
food, you immature infant.

41:48.907 --> 41:52.008
I just wish you could appreciate
this moment I'm having.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.310
- It's hard for me
to appreciate things

41:54.312 --> 41:56.346
on such an empty stomach.

41:56.348 --> 41:57.614
- Here.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.883
I got some things
to think about.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.551
- Oh, what, you're
not gonna stay now?

42:01.553 --> 42:03.186
What the fuck, come on?

42:07.492 --> 42:08.358
Ridiculous.

42:12.297 --> 42:14.831
(sighs deeply)

42:17.569 --> 42:20.403
(dramatic music)

42:31.383 --> 42:32.682
- You love her?

42:33.952 --> 42:36.920
- Yeah.
- (laughs) You still love her?

42:36.922 --> 42:37.820
- Yeah.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.256
- Come on.

42:40.258 --> 42:42.525
What about, what
about the sexbot?

42:43.395 --> 42:46.396
The eMate, I'm sorry, I mean...

42:46.398 --> 42:49.632
Dude, she left
you for a machine.

42:49.634 --> 42:51.067
What does that do to a man?

42:52.037 --> 42:53.770
- I don't blame her.

42:53.772 --> 42:55.505
He's better than me.

42:55.507 --> 42:57.173
She didn't cheat on me.

42:57.175 --> 42:58.308
I knew he was there.

42:58.310 --> 43:00.043
I knew what my competition was.

43:00.045 --> 43:01.277
He won fair and square.

43:01.279 --> 43:03.546
- You don't think that
she cheated on you?

43:03.548 --> 43:05.181
- He's a machine.

43:05.183 --> 43:06.950
He's an intellectual dildo.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.619
There's nothing wrong
with bringing an eMate

43:09.621 --> 43:11.154
into a stale relationship.

43:13.725 --> 43:15.758
I just wish I coulda
been a better man.

43:18.663 --> 43:19.562
- It is a machine.

43:20.465 --> 43:21.764
It's basically just porn.

43:25.337 --> 43:27.370
- I have a favor to ask.

43:27.372 --> 43:28.805
I'll give you another 10K.

43:28.807 --> 43:31.107
- I don't need any more
of your money, man.

43:31.109 --> 43:34.444
- I'll let you interview Quin.
- Just, what do you need?

43:36.414 --> 43:40.283
- I'm gonna win her back.
(Michael laughs)

43:41.987 --> 43:42.885
- Okay.

43:45.090 --> 43:49.559
I'm sorry. (laughing)

43:49.561 --> 43:50.927
What are you writing, man?

43:52.597 --> 43:53.730
- It's just...

43:54.833 --> 43:56.199
Never mind.

43:56.201 --> 43:59.202
- Okay, well, what
do you need from me?

44:00.505 --> 44:01.371
- A mentor.

44:02.507 --> 44:03.906
- Sorry, what?

44:03.908 --> 44:06.643
- A coach, a motivator,
a personal trainer.

44:06.645 --> 44:09.112
I'm a fuckin' mess, and
I need some guidance.

44:09.114 --> 44:10.980
I don't give a fuck
what you call it.

44:12.584 --> 44:14.317
Can you help me get in shape?

44:14.319 --> 44:15.685
Eat better?

44:15.687 --> 44:17.520
Build muscle, detox or whatever?

44:19.124 --> 44:20.957
- I'm gonna stop
you right there.

44:20.959 --> 44:23.760
There is no whatever,.

44:23.762 --> 44:24.994
Okay.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.964
Listen, you don't just
will yourself to change.

44:27.966 --> 44:29.365
It's not one of those
things you start,

44:29.367 --> 44:32.268
waste everyone's
time, and then stop,

44:32.270 --> 44:34.504
because it's not happening
as fast as you want it to.

44:34.506 --> 44:36.739
This is a major
lifestyle adjustment.

44:40.278 --> 44:41.177
To be honest,

44:42.681 --> 44:44.447
I don't know that
you could do it.

44:45.283 --> 44:48.084
It's a huge, it's a huge deal.

44:48.086 --> 44:50.153
All right, are you listening
to what I'm saying?

44:50.155 --> 44:53.156
- You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

44:53.158 --> 44:54.724
I love her.

44:54.726 --> 44:56.192
- Okay.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.560
- Now, do you wanna
talk to Quin, or not?

44:57.562 --> 44:58.828
- No.

44:58.830 --> 45:00.363
I don't need to talk to Quin.

45:03.134 --> 45:04.734
- But you'll still help me out?

45:07.238 --> 45:08.137
- Why not?

45:15.080 --> 45:17.013
- Pictures Will is
going to be an EP,

45:17.015 --> 45:18.781
meaning when it's done,
it'll probably have

45:18.783 --> 45:20.316
five or six songs on it.

45:21.419 --> 45:22.952
- Oh, your father
called me today.

45:22.954 --> 45:25.321
He wants to set up a
surprise party for you.

45:28.159 --> 45:30.159
- Why are you telling me this?

45:30.161 --> 45:32.395
- For your birthday.
- Yeah, obviously.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.697
Why the hell are you
telling me, though?

45:34.699 --> 45:36.632
- Because, I don't feel
like dealing with it.

45:36.634 --> 45:39.035
Let's just do something
special with the kids.

45:39.037 --> 45:40.770
- But it's my birthday.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.906
- Like an ice cream party.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.074
Wouldn't that be nice?

45:48.780 --> 45:53.850
(Brooke laughing)
(upbeat TV music)

45:55.820 --> 45:58.654
- Is there something else
I can help you with, sir?

45:58.656 --> 46:00.156
- No, I'm good, thanks.

46:00.158 --> 46:03.726
- Okay, Mr. Green, I'll
leave you to your privacy.

46:09.267 --> 46:12.101
(dramatic music)

47:09.627 --> 47:11.527
- Something I can get
you while you wait?

47:13.865 --> 47:15.731
- Two whiskeys neat.

47:15.733 --> 47:17.600
- They better both be for you.

47:17.602 --> 47:20.203
Your eMate's not
allowed to drink.

47:20.205 --> 47:21.270
- Not allowed?

47:21.272 --> 47:23.039
- They don't eat.

47:23.041 --> 47:24.974
They don't drink.
- Right.

47:26.311 --> 47:28.678
- So, one whiskey neat?

47:29.814 --> 47:32.748
- No, I'll drink them both.
- Of course.

47:37.355 --> 47:40.022
(upbeat music)

47:45.930 --> 47:47.496
First door on your left.

47:47.498 --> 47:50.132
(upbeat music)

48:10.221 --> 48:12.989
- Mr. Green, your eMate awaits.

48:12.991 --> 48:15.591
(upbeat music)

48:24.235 --> 48:26.469
- [Sophia] Hi
Michael, I'm Sophia.

48:27.438 --> 48:28.304
- Sophia.

48:31.109 --> 48:32.341
Hi Sophia.

48:32.343 --> 48:33.876
- Take a seat.

48:33.878 --> 48:38.948
(upbeat music)
(people chatting)

48:50.028 --> 48:52.261
What should we talk about?

48:53.364 --> 48:54.864
- I don't know.

48:54.866 --> 48:56.132
- Should we talk at all?

48:58.569 --> 49:02.605
- I guess normally, I would
ask you where you're from.

49:04.242 --> 49:06.208
- Do you want me to
make something up?

49:07.078 --> 49:08.678
- No.

49:08.680 --> 49:09.745
Yeah.

49:09.747 --> 49:10.713
No, I don't know.

49:13.751 --> 49:15.618
We gotta talk about
something, right?

49:15.620 --> 49:18.421
- So, you seem to be
under that impression.

49:18.423 --> 49:19.922
- What impression?

49:19.924 --> 49:21.757
- The impression that
two intelligent beings

49:21.759 --> 49:24.360
must talk in order for them
to get to know one another.

49:26.097 --> 49:27.630
- Well,

49:27.632 --> 49:29.231
how else are two people

49:29.233 --> 49:33.536
supposed to get to know
each other, or beings?

49:33.538 --> 49:34.437
Sorry.

49:35.540 --> 49:37.340
How am I supposed
to refer to you?

49:37.342 --> 49:39.275
- Refer to me
however you'd like.

49:40.411 --> 49:42.778
- Let's go with beings,
we have that in common.

49:43.715 --> 49:45.414
So if not for conversation,

49:45.416 --> 49:48.417
how are two beings supposed
to get to know one another?

49:50.154 --> 49:52.121
- The answer is right
under your nose.

49:54.993 --> 49:58.094
We're not just intellectual
beings, after all.

49:59.864 --> 50:01.097
I don't know about you,

50:01.099 --> 50:03.766
but I consider myself
more of a sexual being.

50:03.768 --> 50:04.900
- I can see that.

50:05.970 --> 50:07.670
- I can assure you,

50:07.672 --> 50:10.573
we don't need conversation to
get to know my sexual side.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.643
- Jesus, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

50:16.714 --> 50:19.648
- I have a question.
- What is your question?

50:19.650 --> 50:21.584
- How do I know that
you're not real?

50:23.955 --> 50:25.855
- Don't you mean the opposite?
- No.

50:26.824 --> 50:28.791
- You don't want me to be real?

50:28.793 --> 50:31.794
- No, you can't be real.

50:31.796 --> 50:34.263
'Cause if you're real then
I'll be cheating on my wife.

50:35.666 --> 50:36.565
- I see.

50:38.636 --> 50:41.404
- God, you are beautiful.

50:41.406 --> 50:42.304
You're soft.

50:44.942 --> 50:46.475
There's no way you're not real.

50:46.477 --> 50:47.376
- Michael.

50:49.714 --> 50:50.913
You customized me.

50:51.916 --> 50:53.416
You created me moments ago.

50:54.485 --> 50:56.585
You picked out my
hair, my lips, my eyes,

50:56.587 --> 50:59.055
and the contents of my mind.
- But what if it's

51:00.758 --> 51:01.991
a trick?

51:01.993 --> 51:04.560
I don't know, if it's
like a magic act?

51:04.562 --> 51:06.695
What if you're human?
- Michael,

51:07.799 --> 51:09.065
my new friend,

51:10.234 --> 51:12.168
you're gonna take
me to the bedroom.

51:12.170 --> 51:14.270
You're gonna take
my clothes off.

51:14.272 --> 51:16.272
Below my neck, you are
going to see and feel

51:16.274 --> 51:19.442
the only part of
me that physically
indicates that I am not

51:20.611 --> 51:21.510
real.

51:25.416 --> 51:26.315
Now.

51:27.819 --> 51:29.752
Are you ready to
take my clothes off?

51:31.055 --> 51:36.125
(mellow music)
(people chatting)

51:38.496 --> 51:39.395
- Okay.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.399
Yeah.

51:48.439 --> 51:49.805
Yeah, let's do that.

51:49.807 --> 51:52.441
(upbeat music)

52:44.128 --> 52:45.027
- Michael.

52:46.497 --> 52:47.396
Michael.

52:49.567 --> 52:50.799
You're acting weird.

52:51.702 --> 52:54.336
What up, am I missing something?

52:57.742 --> 52:58.641
- I, uh

53:01.245 --> 53:03.112
think I'll take the
kids to daycare.

53:04.849 --> 53:05.714
- [Brooke] What?

53:07.785 --> 53:08.651
- Yeah.

53:09.854 --> 53:11.053
Yeah, I'll take the kids.

53:11.055 --> 53:12.922
Spend a little time with them.

53:12.924 --> 53:14.423
- [Brooke] Okay.

53:14.425 --> 53:16.926
Are you sure I'm not missing
anything, you look upset.

53:17.895 --> 53:19.428
- No, I'm not upset.

53:19.430 --> 53:21.664
Is that a big deal?

53:21.666 --> 53:23.132
- No.
- Right, well,

53:23.134 --> 53:25.968
I'll take the kids, stop by
the park, go for a quick swing.

53:27.939 --> 53:29.738
- (chuckles) Okay.
- Okay.

53:33.811 --> 53:35.377
Let's go, kids, field trip.

53:35.379 --> 53:37.746
Bus leaves in five minutes!

53:37.748 --> 53:40.349
- I guess I have time
to clean the kitchen.

53:40.351 --> 53:41.483
- Don't think about it.

53:41.485 --> 53:42.551
I'll clean it later.

53:45.990 --> 53:47.990
All right, forget
about exercising now.

53:47.992 --> 53:49.692
You know, you're already
not doing it right.

53:49.694 --> 53:51.193
Focus on your diet.

53:51.195 --> 53:53.329
'Cause if you don't put things
in your body that you need,

53:53.331 --> 53:55.731
you won't get what
you want out of it.

53:55.733 --> 53:57.967
- So who is this woman
you're taking me to,

53:57.969 --> 53:59.501
some kind of vegan nut?

53:59.503 --> 54:01.904
Does she farm his own veggies?
- No, smart ass.

54:01.906 --> 54:04.173
But she does know what
she's talking about.

54:04.175 --> 54:06.942
(knocking on door)

54:06.944 --> 54:09.311
- How many times do I
have to, (gasps) Michael!

54:09.313 --> 54:11.547
- My girl, what's happening?
- What's up?

54:11.549 --> 54:14.016
Is this your boy?
- This is my brother-in-law.

54:14.018 --> 54:15.351
- Drew
- Bring it on in.

54:15.353 --> 54:16.185
Alli,

54:16.187 --> 54:18.020
Alli.
(Drew chuckles)

54:18.022 --> 54:19.788
Come on in, welcome.

54:19.790 --> 54:21.991
- [Michael] Come on, man,
she's a beast in the kitchen.

54:23.127 --> 54:27.129
- What's this?
- This is spinach, man.

54:27.131 --> 54:28.597
These are carrots.

54:29.867 --> 54:31.133
- Okay. (chuckles)

54:31.135 --> 54:33.569
So, like, what is this
juicing thing, anyway?

54:33.571 --> 54:36.839
- (sighs) Juicing is a
religious experience.

54:36.841 --> 54:38.774
It's a lifestyle alteration.

54:38.776 --> 54:40.843
A mind and body transformation.

54:40.845 --> 54:42.311
Are you into computer stuff?

54:43.948 --> 54:47.016
- Not really, just video games.

54:47.018 --> 54:49.852
- It's a complete
system upgrade, you dig?

54:50.755 --> 54:52.187
- I dig.

54:52.189 --> 54:55.090
- So what are we talking
here, a breakdown on benefits?

54:55.092 --> 54:57.393
You want recipes,
recommendations, taste tests?

54:57.395 --> 55:00.696
- I was thinking of getting
Drew here on the detox program.

55:00.698 --> 55:02.498
- Ooh, you're right.

55:02.500 --> 55:03.966
This is the nigga

55:03.968 --> 55:05.200
who's trying to get back
with his girlfriend, right?

55:05.202 --> 55:06.702
- [Michael] Yep.

55:06.704 --> 55:07.870
- My man,

55:07.872 --> 55:10.906
you need a strong woody.
- (scoffs) A what?

55:10.908 --> 55:13.075
- Too much fast
food, too much soda?

55:13.077 --> 55:14.910
Dairy products?

55:14.912 --> 55:16.345
- Probably.

55:17.682 --> 55:19.848
- I mean, a soft Woodrow
will kill any relationship.

55:19.850 --> 55:21.383
- Okay, that's not the problem.

55:22.553 --> 55:23.919
- Detox is right.

55:23.921 --> 55:25.054
We're gonna clean you out,

55:25.056 --> 55:26.488
and we're gonna pump you full of

55:26.490 --> 55:29.091
so many vitamins
and antioxidants,

55:29.093 --> 55:31.126
that your lady's gonna
be singing in her sleep.

55:31.128 --> 55:33.028
- Okay, look, I'm just
trying to get healthy.

55:33.030 --> 55:36.999
I don't know if I need this
detox thing or this other thing.

55:37.001 --> 55:38.801
My dick is fine.

55:38.803 --> 55:40.035
- Brother.

55:40.037 --> 55:41.837
Look around, what do you see?

55:41.839 --> 55:45.607
- Fruits and vegetables.
- You don't see dope?

55:45.609 --> 55:46.775
- [Drew] Dope?

55:46.777 --> 55:48.777
- You don't see no
hash, no sour, no Kush?

55:48.779 --> 55:51.080
- Uh, no.

55:51.082 --> 55:52.848
- You wanna search
me for weapons?

55:53.851 --> 55:56.819
- What is this?
- This ain't a hash bar.

55:56.821 --> 55:59.955
You don't come in and select
your favorite strain of weed.

55:59.957 --> 56:02.825
We dealing juice
here, not drugs.

56:05.529 --> 56:07.129
You wanna get healthy?

56:07.131 --> 56:08.731
Welcome to heaven.

56:08.733 --> 56:10.366
Now, my boy brought you in here,

56:10.368 --> 56:12.835
and I'm gonna take care of you.

56:12.837 --> 56:14.436
We're gonna detox that ass,

56:14.438 --> 56:16.138
and we're gonna make
sure that your Woody

56:16.140 --> 56:17.406
is standing at attention

56:17.408 --> 56:18.674
every time your lady
walks into the room.

56:18.676 --> 56:21.009
- For the last time, my
dick is not the problem.

56:22.480 --> 56:23.379
- You trust him?

56:24.882 --> 56:27.049
You then for damn sure trust me.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.584
We're your guardian angels.

56:28.586 --> 56:31.620
Now, you wanna go to heaven?

56:33.858 --> 56:36.392
- Okay, let's do this detox.

56:37.495 --> 56:40.629
- Take notes, Woodrow
Wilson., take notes.

56:40.631 --> 56:43.532
(orchestra music)

58:07.751 --> 58:10.986
(gentle piano music)

58:17.194 --> 58:18.961
- [Michael] How do
you feel when I leave?

58:20.297 --> 58:22.364
- [Sophia] I miss you
with every breath I take.

58:23.701 --> 58:25.567
- [Michael] Serious.

58:25.569 --> 58:26.869
What do you feel?

58:28.105 --> 58:29.571
- [Sophia] Empty.

58:29.573 --> 58:30.739
I don't feel anything.

58:31.909 --> 58:32.875
- [Michael] Jesus.

58:33.677 --> 58:35.244
That's awfully grim, isn't it?

58:36.113 --> 58:38.146
- From your perspective, yes.

58:39.550 --> 58:41.717
- What about your perspective?

58:41.719 --> 58:43.719
Do you even have a perspective?

58:44.955 --> 58:47.456
- [Sophia] I have
limited perspective.

58:47.458 --> 58:49.892
I know what you like,
I know what you want.

58:51.028 --> 58:53.295
I'm still learning what
is important to you.

58:54.765 --> 58:56.465
I guess I'm still developing.

58:57.935 --> 58:59.801
I think I would need
more experiences with you

58:59.803 --> 59:01.670
to develop a bigger perspective.

59:03.007 --> 59:05.007
- [Michael] More experiences?

59:05.009 --> 59:06.675
- [Sophia] Does that make sense?

59:09.313 --> 59:10.345
- [Michael] Sophia,

59:11.916 --> 59:13.982
I think I'd like to
take you out of here.

59:15.386 --> 59:17.953
I think I'd like to
show the world to you,

59:19.123 --> 59:21.990
and introduce you to the world.

59:21.992 --> 59:24.226
Would you like that?

59:24.228 --> 59:26.395
- [Sophia] The world,
the outside world?

59:27.531 --> 59:29.231
Where you come from?

59:29.233 --> 59:31.033
- [Michael] Yeah.

59:31.035 --> 59:33.201
- [Sophia] That
would be wonderful.

59:33.203 --> 59:36.338
(gentle piano music)

59:55.492 --> 59:57.359
- I'll do it, but you're nuts.

59:57.361 --> 59:58.827
- It's research.

59:58.829 --> 01:00:00.162
- I don't care.

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:02.631
You know how my sister feels.
- It's two weeks.

01:00:03.567 --> 01:00:05.467
- So, they let you do this?

01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:06.868
- It's a trial run.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.036
I told them I was
thinking about buying her.

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:10.205
- Her?

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:11.440
Who?

01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:12.741
- Sophia.

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:13.875
- Sophia?

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:15.544
What, what are you involved?

01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:17.980
- No, for Christ sakes.

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:19.514
I told you, it's all research.

01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:20.549
She's, um...

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:23.251
I'm writing eMates
into the story.

01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:27.456
I gotta know how they operate,
and work in the real world.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.592
- So, what am I supposed
to do with her at my place?

01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:32.461
Am I supposed to give her a key?

01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:34.696
- What do you do with Quin
when you're not there?

01:00:34.698 --> 01:00:36.498
- She just lies down.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.735
- All right, just let
Sophia lie next to her then.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:40.969
- Okay, but if you do this,

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.838
you better not let any
of your friends see you.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.906
- I'm married, I don't
have any friends.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:53.982
- Check out this view.

01:00:55.853 --> 01:00:59.021
It's the perfect metaphor
for the human condition.

01:00:59.023 --> 01:00:59.888
- Oh, it is?

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:06.461
- Manipulating natural elements

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:08.497
to develop scientific methods

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:12.567
for circumventing
natural elements is
man's greatest irony.

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:15.671
- Are you making fun of me?

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:17.139
- No.

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:18.907
I leave that up
to your intellect.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:19.808
- (chuckles) Okay.

01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:25.881
- Permission to speak
frankly to my human.

01:01:27.418 --> 01:01:28.950
- Permission granted, Sexbot.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.622
- I'm enjoying my time
with these experiences,

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:36.758
getting inside of you.

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:39.928
I think I would
enjoy it much more

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.730
if you were getting
inside of me.

01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:45.434
- You are a dirty manipulation
of natural elements.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.938
- If you find the spot,
I'll share the pleasure.

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.640
- Stop talking right now.

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:54.743
Okay.

01:01:55.646 --> 01:01:57.879
All right, I think I got a spot.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.715
(chuckling) This is
fucking crazy, come on.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:04.086
(Sophia giggling)

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:07.022
- [Cameron] Why don't they
play poker in the jungle?

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:08.857
- Why?
- Too many

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:12.160
cheetahs.
(Diana laughing)

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:19.234
(people chatting)

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:21.737
- Why did Batman skip church?

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.641
- I don't know, why
did Batman skip church?

01:02:26.643 --> 01:02:27.542
- Christian Bale.

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:31.379
(Diana laughing)

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.415
- You're so fucking cheesy.
- Me?

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:34.382
It was your idea.

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:38.386
- [Diana] Well, I guess
we're both cheesy.

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:39.488
- [Cameron] If you want cheesy,

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:41.389
I have a whole bunch more jokes.

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:44.826
- [Diana] Oh, all right,
tell me some more. (laughing)

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.766
- [Cameron] Why didn't the
toilet paper cross the road?

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:54.236
- [Diana] I don't know.

01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:56.004
- [Cameron] It was
caught in a crack.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:58.840
(Diana laughing)

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:07.015
- [Diana] Oh my god. (laughing)

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:09.818
(dramatic music)

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:31.206
- What was that?

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:32.774
- What?

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:34.176
- You're letting me win.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:35.677
- No I'm not.

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:37.479
- You were about to crush
me, and you moved back.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.047
- [Quin] Yeah?

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:40.549
- Don't let me win!

01:03:40.551 --> 01:03:42.083
- You like to win.

01:03:42.085 --> 01:03:44.686
- Of course, I like
to win, but on my own.

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:46.388
I don't need you to let me win.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:48.723
- Well then, why are
you playing with me?

01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:51.159
- What?
- Why do you need me?

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.527
- For the challenge.

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:55.263
- If I win, you're defeated.
- Yes.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:57.399
- If you win, you are happy.
- Yes.

01:03:57.401 --> 01:04:01.002
- So it is better if you win.
- No, I need to be challenged.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.838
- But you'll never win.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.774
- I can win, if I can improve.

01:04:05.776 --> 01:04:08.343
- How?
- By being challenged.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.645
- [Quin] Your program is
just as finite as mine.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:13.281
You're limited to your
original purpose and function.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.117
- I can change my program.

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:17.252
- [Quin] How?

01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:19.187
- By being challenged.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:21.690
- Then I can change my program.

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:22.724
- No.

01:04:22.726 --> 01:04:23.992
- [Quin] Why not?

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:27.128
- Because you can't
change your program.

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:28.263
- I can't, why?

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:31.633
- A challenge...

01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:35.203
A challenge is something that
comes from within a person.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:37.305
It's something that
motivates a person.

01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:38.573
It has to come within.

01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:40.876
Or, at least, it has
to be believed within.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.980
- Why haven't you
beaten me at chess?

01:04:44.982 --> 01:04:46.281
- It takes time

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:48.783
to learn the game and
to learn your opponent.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.853
- Over time you can change?

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:54.089
- Over time, yeah.

01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:55.357
- Over time you can win?

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.726
- Yeah.

01:04:57.728 --> 01:04:59.694
- Why haven't you won in
the time you've been given?

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:03.832
- It hasn't been enough.

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.334
- How do you know you're right?

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.570
- I feel it.

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:17.145
- So I am who I am, incapable
of changing programs,

01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:19.948
but you're who you want to
be when motivated to change?

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:22.951
- Yes.

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:25.153
- [Quin] So who do you become

01:05:25.155 --> 01:05:27.088
when your motivation dissolves?

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.158
What happens when something
you want doesn't work out?

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.061
(dramatic music)

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:04.492
- I said it's bath,
you know how to do it!

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.061
Don't make me come in there!

01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:11.099
Oh, these kids are
driving me insane.

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:14.636
Is it so terrible for
me to want my kids,

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.238
thanks, clean?

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.975
Is it so unnatural for
them to want to smell good,

01:06:20.877 --> 01:06:22.477
feel soft?

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.145
- Hey.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:26.614
- Hmm?
- You're a wonderful mother.

01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:29.884
You are.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:42.430
(dramatic music)

01:06:52.943 --> 01:06:54.476
- What?

01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:57.612
- What, uh, Makowski, what
do we have going on here?

01:06:57.614 --> 01:06:59.647
- Mayakovsky.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:02.183
You studying for a
job, or something?

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.718
What's up?

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.754
- I changed my mind
about the concert.

01:07:05.756 --> 01:07:07.689
I'm not going to go.
- What?

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.357
Why?

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.593
- I'm just doing other things.

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:14.062
- It's fucking Tokyo's Revenge,
man, they're your favorite.

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:16.431
- I don't know that
they are anymore.

01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:18.566
I've been exploring other music.

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:20.201
You should really give
a listen to jazz, man.

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:21.970
I think you'd really like it.

01:07:21.972 --> 01:07:23.972
- Did you just tell
me to listen to jazz?

01:07:23.974 --> 01:07:25.273
- Yeah.
- Jazz?

01:07:25.275 --> 01:07:26.608
- It's a little different, but--

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.676
- Ah, okay, I get it.

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:30.211
I get it.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.947
Come on, all right, so when
is the, uh, when's the show?

01:07:32.949 --> 01:07:35.650
- Huh?
- Diana, when do you see her?

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:36.918
- This isn't a show.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.119
- Nah, all right, all
right, so, like a,

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:40.221
like a dress rehearsal,
it's like practice.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.524
- I told you, I'm changing
some things about me.

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:44.559
- Fucking everything
about you, man.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:45.760
- Most things, so what?

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:47.262
- You're not
changing shit, Drew.

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:48.563
You're pretending, it's an act.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.098
- I'm not pretending.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.900
- Look, I don't care.

01:07:51.902 --> 01:07:54.803
You wanna dress like a
yuppie to go to a metal show,

01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:55.804
I'm good with it, man.

01:07:55.806 --> 01:07:57.038
- I'm not going to the concert.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.373
I gave you both
tickets right there.

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:00.308
- Dude, Tokyo's Revenge!

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:01.709
They're your favorite
fucking band.

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:03.812
- They're your favorite
band, not mine.

01:08:03.814 --> 01:08:06.147
I bought those tickets
for you, remember?

01:08:06.149 --> 01:08:09.184
- You are being such an
amazing cock right now.

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:12.087
Like, dude, we've
known each other

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:13.388
forever, all right.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:14.856
I know you, man.

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:16.691
I know what you like,
and I know what you love.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:18.193
It's not this, man.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:19.394
It's not sipping on tea

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.796
and reading books
you don't understand.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:26.801
Look man, (sighs) whatever
fucked up head trip

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:30.071
Diana has you on, you're
gonna snap out of it soon.

01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:32.640
You're gonna fucking fall
flat on your face again.

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:37.011
- "Friendship is constant
in all other things,

01:08:37.013 --> 01:08:40.715
"save in the office
and affairs of love.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:44.786
"Therefore, all hearts in love
should use their own tongues.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:49.224
"Let every eye negotiate for
itself, and trust no agent,

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.091
"for beauty is a witch

01:08:51.094 --> 01:08:54.328
"against whose charms
faith melteth into blood."

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.732
Shakespeare, Much
Ado About Nothing.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.705
- I got nothing.

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:05.406
- David.

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:08.276
I've become charmed.

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:11.578
By Diana at first,

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:13.615
Hero to my Claudio.

01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:15.550
Beauty beyond mine grasp.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.051
But greater still,

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:21.656
I've become enchanted by the
fruits of a fearless world,

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.390
an endless garden of Godly gifts

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:25.260
offered to only those
that free themselves

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.694
from grounded complacence.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.531
Charles Darwin.

01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:31.933
"It is not the strongest of
the species that survives,

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:33.334
"nor the most intelligent,

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:36.069
"but the one most
responsive to change."

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:40.608
My friend, there's more to
life than just video games.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.711
I'm afraid I've evolved.

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.180
I've matured.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:48.716
I've opened my eyes,
I've spread my wings.

01:09:48.718 --> 01:09:50.151
The wind has me now.
- No, no, no.

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:51.786
- It glides me to--
- Stop.

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:55.023
- So, you're not
going to the show?

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:55.924
Fantastic.

01:10:04.167 --> 01:10:06.234
"But don't come
running back to me

01:10:06.236 --> 01:10:10.405
"when you get treated the
exact same way you treated me."

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:11.606
Big Sean.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:16.177
(upbeat music)
(people chatting)

01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:28.122
(cell phone buzzing)

01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:32.060
- Hey Rei.

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:34.629
Yeah, did you get my notes?

01:10:35.532 --> 01:10:36.931
- Notes?

01:10:36.933 --> 01:10:38.733
This looks like a draft to me.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.301
- It's an outline.

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:41.836
What do you think?

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:43.705
- It's brilliant.

01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:46.941
It's dark, it's
magical, it's scary.

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:49.277
I mean, teens are
gonna eat this shit up.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:51.913
- Great, set the meetings up.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:54.983
- Did I catch you at a bad time?

01:10:54.985 --> 01:10:57.518
Are you with Brooke?
- No!

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.486
I mean, no, I'm not with anyone.

01:10:58.488 --> 01:11:00.288
- Okay, 'cause it sounds like

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:01.923
you're making out
with your wife, dude,

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:03.591
and it's kinda disgusting.

01:11:04.461 --> 01:11:05.326
- No.

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:08.696
- Why don't you just call
me back when you can talk?

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:09.664
- Okay, fine.

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:12.033
I, um, didn't want to be rude.

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:14.535
- Yeah, okay.

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:17.372
Are you guys trying for
another kid, I mean,

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:19.140
just let me go to
voicemail next time.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.177
- Okay, whatever,
I'll call you later.

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:24.412
- Oh, Mike!

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:27.015
The sexbot, it's
a great idea, but

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:29.651
the character will
need some work.

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:31.552
She's just not believable yet.
- Oh.

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:33.721
- Later.

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:37.492
(music box music)

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:40.895
- I don't understand.
- I need to please you.

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:42.230
- You do?

01:11:42.232 --> 01:11:43.131
- Sexually.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
How do I please you sexually?

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:47.302
- Just be who you are.

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:51.039
- No, I can't be who I
am, I'm trying to change.

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:53.007
I'm trying to be
better than who I am.

01:11:54.044 --> 01:11:55.243
- Do you to dominate?

01:11:55.245 --> 01:11:56.978
We could switch roles.
- Quin, goddammit.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.813
Why is this so hard?

01:11:58.815 --> 01:11:59.881
- Baby, what's wrong?

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:04.452
- Can you be pleased sexually?

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:08.589
Is it within your function?

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:11.359
- I'm meant to give
pleasure, not to receive it.

01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:14.262
(music box music)

01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:23.705
Have I lost my purpose with you?

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:26.674
(music box music)

01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:34.682
- [Michael] Jesus
Christ, Brooke.

01:12:35.618 --> 01:12:37.218
What are you doing in the dark?

01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:39.620
- Waiting for you, my love.

01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:45.960
So, who is she?
- {scoffs) Who is who?

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:47.328
- The woman you're seeing?

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:50.198
- [Michael] I'm not
seeing any woman.

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:54.669
- Who were you necking
in public yesterday?

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:55.737
- Oh my god.

01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:59.273
Who told you that I was?

01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:01.075
Is this another
jealous Reign rant?

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:05.480
I promise you nothing ever--
- It's not about Reign.

01:13:05.482 --> 01:13:07.148
It's not about Reign.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:10.118
She's the one who heard
you with somebody else.

01:13:12.622 --> 01:13:13.654
- You spoke to Reign?

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:16.124
- I ran into her,

01:13:16.126 --> 01:13:19.460
and she apologized
for interrupting
our intimate moment.

01:13:19.462 --> 01:13:21.229
- No, no, no, no, I told her

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:22.730
she was jumping to
conclusions, okay.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:25.333
She had it in her head that
something was going on.

01:13:25.335 --> 01:13:27.535
Yes, she thought
that you were there--

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:30.338
- Michael, who was she?

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:32.440
- I wasn't necking on anybody.

01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:35.610
- Then what did Reign hear?
- It was some

01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:38.413
goddamn old couple next to me.

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:40.915
I didn't know they were
so loud, all right?

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:43.651
As soon as Rei made
the comment, I moved.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:45.887
I didn't realize
how loud they were.

01:13:45.889 --> 01:13:48.890
I mean, this whole fucking
city's so loud and crowded,

01:13:48.892 --> 01:13:50.391
you know, but I'm used to it.

01:13:50.393 --> 01:13:53.027
And then when my hone rings,
and it's my business partner,

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.163
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna wait

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:56.731
and go look for some quiet spot

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:58.166
not when we're in the middle
of these vital meetings.

01:13:58.168 --> 01:13:59.500
I'm gonna answer it.

01:13:59.502 --> 01:14:00.968
Okay, no matter
where the fuck I am,

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:03.171
or who the fuck I'm next to!
- Okay.

01:14:04.307 --> 01:14:05.773
- You know how Reign can be.
- Yeah.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:08.042
I know how Reign can be.
- She just, she--

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:09.944
- It was just

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:12.613
strange news to hear, and
it caught me off guard.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.085
- Manager.

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:55.623
- You'd like to see the manager?

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:56.524
- Yes.

01:14:57.393 --> 01:14:58.993
- Um, what about?

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.862
- Your fucking sexbots.

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:05.233
- Okay, um,

01:15:05.235 --> 01:15:06.133
right this way.

01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:11.572
(dramatic music)

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:33.714
How can I help you?

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:38.619
- Is this a fucking joke?

01:17:39.389 --> 01:17:40.688
You're the manager?

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:42.156
You run this place?

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:44.225
You could have told me that
all the way back there?

01:17:45.695 --> 01:17:47.261
- This is where I do business.

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:59.340
Would you like to sit?
- No, thank you.

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:07.148
- You fell in love with her.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:10.251
- I have a wife.

01:18:11.688 --> 01:18:13.454
I have two kids.

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:14.355
- So what?

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.324
- What?

01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:19.493
- Do you love 'em?
- Yeah.

01:18:19.495 --> 01:18:20.661
Of course I love them.

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:22.963
- Do you love your wife?
- I just said that I love 'em.

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:26.233
- Then what's the problem?

01:18:34.977 --> 01:18:37.378
- I'm falling for a machine.

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:40.014
One of your

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:42.383
machines!

01:18:43.453 --> 01:18:46.821
- (laughs) That's incredible.
- No.

01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:51.826
No, it's not.

01:18:51.828 --> 01:18:53.461
It's fucking torture.

01:18:53.463 --> 01:18:57.898
My life is ruined, my
marriage is ruined,

01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:01.135
and I don't know how I got here.

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:06.207
- Sit down.

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:09.243
Sit down, let's talk.

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:20.821
How could falling in love

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:23.491
be a bad thing?

01:19:24.594 --> 01:19:25.559
- Are you married?

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:30.164
- People fall in love
with sports teams.

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:32.933
They fall in love
with music and movies.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:35.936
They fall in love
with vacation spots.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:38.139
They fall in love
with amusement parks.

01:19:39.142 --> 01:19:41.942
They fall in love with museums,

01:19:43.045 --> 01:19:44.845
with dogs,

01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:47.681
with pizza, with coffee mugs.

01:19:47.683 --> 01:19:52.119
People fall in love with
everything around them.

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:54.088
How is any of it harmful?

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:58.893
- You don't make pizza.

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:02.096
You don't make coffee mugs.

01:20:02.098 --> 01:20:03.964
You're not running
a fucking museum.

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:10.671
You make robots that
affect people's emotions,

01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:15.743
and you're fucking sick if you
think that it's pleasurable

01:20:16.546 --> 01:20:17.845
to watch them manipulate people.

01:20:17.847 --> 01:20:20.714
- My machines don't
manipulate people.

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:24.952
People manipulate themselves.

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:30.224
My machines are
programmed subordinates.

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:32.359
They are designed to react

01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:35.262
and to take orders.

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:39.200
If feelings are involved,
it's a direct reflection

01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:42.770
of the human spirit
interacting with them.

01:20:42.772 --> 01:20:47.074
If emotions become
damaged, once again,

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:49.476
it is a reflection
of the human spirit

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:53.881
interacting with them, their
issues, their problems.

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.650
It's not my robot

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:01.488
you have an issue with,
it's your confused morality.

01:21:02.959 --> 01:21:04.091
It's you.

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:11.432
You have these ideas
of what love is

01:21:13.169 --> 01:21:14.401
of where it belongs,
what it's value is.

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:22.710
You decide when it's right,
you decide when it's wrong.

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:27.882
You follow your
wife's inclinations.

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:31.051
You follow your
parents' traditions.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:33.287
You follow society's rules.

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:37.858
And it all leads you into
this closed conception

01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:40.995
of what you think love is.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.700
You ever stare

01:21:46.702 --> 01:21:49.136
at a painting and realized
you haven't blinked?

01:21:52.275 --> 01:21:56.577
The taste of your favorite
ice cream on a really hot day?

01:21:58.214 --> 01:22:02.016
Has the summer breeze ever
kept you from getting up?

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:08.422
Has your hobby ever
made you forget to eat?

01:22:09.926 --> 01:22:13.127
When your kid grabs your
hand as you cross the street,

01:22:13.129 --> 01:22:14.728
do you ever not notice?

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:22.770
Whatever you think
love is, it's,

01:22:22.772 --> 01:22:23.704
it's more.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:28.342
Add up all of these
memories inside your head

01:22:28.344 --> 01:22:30.811
and multiply them by
the number of times

01:22:30.813 --> 01:22:32.579
you make someone smile.

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:36.183
That is your potential.

01:22:39.155 --> 01:22:42.589
It's one thing
for your ignorance

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:47.294
to blind you from these
observations, but shame on you

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:50.664
for taking something so

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:54.368
pure and so beautiful,
and complicating it

01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:55.736
to try to make it
fit into somewhere

01:22:55.738 --> 01:22:58.005
that you think it
should, shame on you

01:22:58.007 --> 01:23:00.741
for plucking the
life and the magic

01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:05.813
of the essence of being human
and kicking it to the curb

01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:08.015
because it's inconvenient.

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:12.753
I don't make pizza,

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:15.356
I don't make mugs,

01:23:15.358 --> 01:23:17.191
and I'm not running a museum.

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:22.129
You're damn right.

01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:25.065
I'm smiling because
you fell in love

01:23:25.067 --> 01:23:26.867
with one of my machines.

01:23:29.405 --> 01:23:30.304
You're welcome.

01:23:38.414 --> 01:23:41.148
- What am I supposed to do then?

01:23:45.087 --> 01:23:46.086
- I'm a salesman.

01:23:47.923 --> 01:23:49.790
I only know what
I'm supposed to do.

01:24:03.606 --> 01:24:04.905
You can go now.

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:12.279
(orchestra music)

01:24:56.258 --> 01:25:01.328
(people chatting)
(orchestra music)

01:25:33.129 --> 01:25:36.763
- If you control the people,
you control the world.

01:25:36.765 --> 01:25:40.467
They tried everything they
could to try to control us.

01:25:40.469 --> 01:25:44.738
Because they know we
are emotional people.

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:48.075
They tried to divide us by
playing on our emotions.

01:25:48.077 --> 01:25:49.143
You know why, right?

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:52.012
- [Drew] I don't know, why?

01:25:52.014 --> 01:25:56.316
- Because, if you keep the
people emotional and angry,

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:59.753
you distract them from building
their own financial empires

01:25:59.755 --> 01:26:01.622
and taking care
of their families,

01:26:01.624 --> 01:26:04.358
and their family's families.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.727
I mean, think about it, bro.

01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:10.664
(sighs) First you program
people emotionally, right?

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:12.633
Next you destroy their health.

01:26:12.635 --> 01:26:14.034
The best way to do that

01:26:14.036 --> 01:26:16.904
is through the food
and water supply.

01:26:16.906 --> 01:26:20.674
I mean, Henry Kissinger
snitched on the whole operation.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:25.379
He said, "If you control the
oil, you control the country.

01:26:25.381 --> 01:26:28.882
"And if you control the food,
you control the population."

01:26:30.252 --> 01:26:35.088
So now we've been programmed
(scoffs) to rely on microchips

01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:37.524
more than we rely on each other.

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:39.026
We no longer talk to each other,

01:26:39.028 --> 01:26:43.397
we only follow each
other online, what?

01:26:43.399 --> 01:26:44.932
But this,

01:26:44.934 --> 01:26:47.401
this is the remedy.

01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:50.470
This is how we get
back to our roots.

01:26:50.472 --> 01:26:53.073
This is how we bring humanity

01:26:53.075 --> 01:26:56.510
back to our essence,
I mean, guys, oh.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.280
(sighs) Just take this.

01:27:00.282 --> 01:27:01.582
Clean that up.

01:27:01.584 --> 01:27:03.283
I'm gonna go talk to this dude.

01:27:03.285 --> 01:27:06.286
(orchestra music)

01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:11.825
This is spinach, man.

01:27:11.827 --> 01:27:13.260
These are apples.

01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:17.898
- I thought you loved her.

01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:21.835
- That's exactly the problem.
- How?

01:27:23.439 --> 01:27:24.972
- I saw how happy she was.

01:27:25.874 --> 01:27:26.773
- (scoffs) And?

01:27:28.177 --> 01:27:29.243
- That's it.

01:27:29.245 --> 01:27:30.143
She's happy.

01:27:34.049 --> 01:27:34.948
- I'm fucked.

01:27:36.518 --> 01:27:37.417
- I know.

01:27:38.821 --> 01:27:40.420
- You know about me and Sophia?

01:27:41.357 --> 01:27:42.422
- I'm not an idiot.

01:27:45.194 --> 01:27:46.360
- I'm so fucked.

01:27:48.464 --> 01:27:49.429
- Do you love her?

01:27:50.899 --> 01:27:52.132
- I don't know, is
there a difference
between loving an idea

01:27:52.134 --> 01:27:53.533
and loving a person?

01:27:55.337 --> 01:27:56.236
- I don't know.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.475
- See, I think I love
the idea of Sophia

01:28:01.477 --> 01:28:03.143
more than I love my wife.

01:28:03.145 --> 01:28:07.347
And if the two things are
equal, then I'm fucked.

01:28:07.349 --> 01:28:10.250
(orchestra music)

01:28:43.986 --> 01:28:44.885
- There she is.

01:28:45.954 --> 01:28:47.554
How you doing?

01:28:47.556 --> 01:28:48.555
- Good.

01:28:48.557 --> 01:28:50.057
How are you
- I'm good.

01:28:50.059 --> 01:28:52.359
Thank you for coming,
I appreciate it.

01:28:52.361 --> 01:28:54.094
You look nice as usual.

01:28:56.365 --> 01:28:59.499
So look, I wanted
to talk to you.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:03.570
If you don't feel the
same, you can tell me, but

01:29:03.572 --> 01:29:06.039
I gotta tell you, I like you.

01:29:07.209 --> 01:29:08.709
I mean, I really like you.

01:29:10.212 --> 01:29:11.978
To be honest, I've always

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:14.581
felt that we were
meant to be together.

01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:16.616
Even back when we were kids,

01:29:16.618 --> 01:29:18.719
teenagers, we were hanging out,

01:29:19.822 --> 01:29:22.089
me and Drew, I used
to always look at you.

01:29:22.091 --> 01:29:24.124
I was always watching you.

01:29:24.126 --> 01:29:26.126
I mean, not like creepy, you
know, but I was watching you

01:29:26.128 --> 01:29:27.060
all the time.

01:29:28.597 --> 01:29:30.130
You're just so beautiful,
you know, I mean,

01:29:30.132 --> 01:29:31.331
I think I love you.

01:29:32.167 --> 01:29:33.133
I mean, seriously,

01:29:35.938 --> 01:29:36.837
I adore you.

01:29:39.742 --> 01:29:42.142
I think about you all the time.

01:29:42.144 --> 01:29:45.011
And that time that we spent
together, right or wrong,

01:29:46.515 --> 01:29:48.582
it's really special to me.

01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:50.350
- David, I'm married.
- I know...

01:29:51.153 --> 01:29:53.120
I know you're married, I know.

01:29:54.223 --> 01:29:56.356
But you've been married, right?

01:29:56.358 --> 01:29:58.525
I mean, you were
married the whole time.

01:29:58.527 --> 01:29:59.760
- It was a mistake.

01:30:00.696 --> 01:30:02.262
I thought we were clear.

01:30:07.503 --> 01:30:08.835
- You were clear on this.

01:30:08.837 --> 01:30:11.204
I guess you were clear,
but I, I wasn't clear.

01:30:13.776 --> 01:30:16.910
I was nervous, a little scared.

01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:18.345
I mean, you were
married, after all.

01:30:18.347 --> 01:30:20.347
- I am married.

01:30:25.821 --> 01:30:26.720
- Are you happy?

01:30:28.824 --> 01:30:29.723
- Yes.

01:30:35.831 --> 01:30:36.730
- Okay.

01:30:39.401 --> 01:30:41.968
You gotta know... You have
to know how I feel about you.

01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:44.638
I don't apologize
for it one bit.

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:45.539
I love you.

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:49.409
Do with that what you will.

01:30:56.218 --> 01:30:57.517
- I have to go.

01:31:00.656 --> 01:31:01.521
Bye.

01:31:06.428 --> 01:31:09.229
(dramatic music)

01:31:32.221 --> 01:31:33.687
- [Georgia] Through
the ages of film,

01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:36.389
we've seen robots peppered
throughout our culture

01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:38.692
from Rosie the Robot
types on The Jetsons

01:31:38.694 --> 01:31:41.628
who relieve exhausted housewives
from their mundane chores

01:31:41.630 --> 01:31:45.398
to cute little smart companions
like R2D2 on Star Wars.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:49.069
But now, those dreamed-up
bots have come to fruition,

01:31:49.071 --> 01:31:51.471
and they've evolved
into something more.

01:31:51.473 --> 01:31:53.507
Technology companies
bridging the gap between

01:31:53.509 --> 01:31:57.644
smart tech and dolls
to create sexbots,

01:31:57.646 --> 01:32:00.080
who will also be
your companions.

01:32:00.082 --> 01:32:04.284
So, what will that mean for the
things that define humanity?

01:32:04.286 --> 01:32:06.853
To answer that, let's now go
to media analyst and attorney,

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:08.855
and what I consider
a modern philosopher,

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:11.057
Atticus from Atticus, Inc.

01:32:11.059 --> 01:32:13.426
Hey, Atticus, a lot
to talk about here.

01:32:13.428 --> 01:32:17.531
The growing interest of
these sexbots is undeniable.

01:32:17.533 --> 01:32:19.699
People are shelling out
tens of thousands of dollars

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:20.767
to buy them.

01:32:20.769 --> 01:32:21.935
There's a wait list.

01:32:21.937 --> 01:32:24.004
I mean, why do you
think this is happening,

01:32:24.006 --> 01:32:26.106
and why are folks so willing

01:32:26.108 --> 01:32:28.909
to drop that kind of
coin on these things.

01:32:28.911 --> 01:32:31.511
- [Atticus] What we're going
to be seeing here, ultimately,

01:32:31.513 --> 01:32:35.382
let's just jump to the
future, is the slow, gradual,

01:32:35.384 --> 01:32:37.784
systematic ruination

01:32:37.786 --> 01:32:40.754
of all that makes humans humans.

01:32:40.756 --> 01:32:42.122
Our devices,

01:32:42.124 --> 01:32:45.025
our social
engineering platforms,

01:32:45.027 --> 01:32:50.096
our social media
are all distancing
ourselves to begin with.

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:52.399
Then we're going
to have this thing.

01:32:52.401 --> 01:32:55.001
It's not going to be
a robot as we think of

01:32:55.003 --> 01:32:56.636
"Danger, Will Robinson,"

01:32:56.638 --> 01:32:59.906
this is going to be
something that looks so human

01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:03.009
that will have texture
and body warmth,

01:33:03.011 --> 01:33:05.211
and that will
sweat and perspire,

01:33:05.213 --> 01:33:09.950
and with artificial
intelligence, will
learn about you.

01:33:09.952 --> 01:33:12.218
Some people will lob
this and they'll say,

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:15.722
"This is terrific because this
will eliminate prostitution,

01:33:15.724 --> 01:33:20.093
"this will eliminate the ways
that humans are compromised."

01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:21.728
But let me give you
an example, Georgia.

01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:26.166
There's this analogy,
the sterile bug analogy.

01:33:26.168 --> 01:33:27.601
You might have heard this.

01:33:27.603 --> 01:33:30.403
When you want to remove
populations of certain vermin,

01:33:30.405 --> 01:33:34.074
what you do is you
release sterile bugs.

01:33:34.076 --> 01:33:36.476
Think, sex robots.

01:33:36.478 --> 01:33:40.714
And what happens is you cause
the populations to decline.

01:33:40.716 --> 01:33:44.451
Ultimately speaking,
at its worst, humans,

01:33:44.453 --> 01:33:46.820
we are going to be the robots.

01:33:46.822 --> 01:33:48.088
- Now--
- We

01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:49.990
are going to lose
our souls in this.

01:33:49.992 --> 01:33:53.393
- [Georgia] Now Atticus, a
lot of women advocacy groups

01:33:53.395 --> 01:33:55.428
are frowning on these
dolls and these robots

01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:56.963
saying that it creates

01:33:56.965 --> 01:34:00.000
yet another avenue for men
to hyper sexualize women,

01:34:00.002 --> 01:34:03.103
and essentially create what
is idealized body image.

01:34:03.105 --> 01:34:04.604
Do you believe that
this will have a

01:34:04.606 --> 01:34:07.607
negative impact on women
and the women's movement?

01:34:07.609 --> 01:34:11.978
- [Atticus] That's the
least of the problem here.

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.313
Hyper sexualized?

01:34:13.315 --> 01:34:14.247
This is...

01:34:14.249 --> 01:34:15.081
You're using...

01:34:15.083 --> 01:34:16.750
Not you.

01:34:16.752 --> 01:34:19.953
they're using old memes,
old bumper stickers.

01:34:19.955 --> 01:34:23.323
This is trans
humanism on steroids.

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:26.626
This has nothing to do
with idealized women

01:34:26.628 --> 01:34:29.362
and certain physiognomy
and morphology.

01:34:29.364 --> 01:34:31.765
This is about us, humans,

01:34:31.767 --> 01:34:34.567
losing our connections
with humans.

01:34:34.569 --> 01:34:37.404
How do you kill the
resistance to being,

01:34:37.406 --> 01:34:40.740
to being held and confined?

01:34:40.742 --> 01:34:43.376
By cutting off human interaction

01:34:43.378 --> 01:34:48.281
little by little, bit by bit,
and this is the next level.

01:34:48.283 --> 01:34:52.152
We humans are not even
engaging each other anymore.

01:34:52.154 --> 01:34:55.422
This is beyond body
shaming and morphology

01:34:55.424 --> 01:34:56.723
and that sort of thing.

01:34:56.725 --> 01:34:58.358
This has something
to do with the fact

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:01.995
that we are taking the most
important thing that we do.

01:35:04.166 --> 01:35:06.700
- We're back in the
Villages again, aren't we?

01:35:06.702 --> 01:35:07.600
- Yeah.

01:35:08.737 --> 01:35:10.770
- You gonna fuck me at
The Road House again?

01:35:10.772 --> 01:35:12.205
- No, I just wanna get a drink.

01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:13.940
- So you'll make
love to me after?

01:35:13.942 --> 01:35:15.475
- Yeah. (sighs)

01:35:15.477 --> 01:35:17.243
- What's got you
wound so tightly?

01:35:18.747 --> 01:35:20.013
- Life.

01:35:20.015 --> 01:35:21.214
- You're with me now.

01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:24.984
Life's a breeze.
- Life is confusing.

01:35:26.188 --> 01:35:27.353
I miss my kids.

01:35:29.758 --> 01:35:31.057
Life...

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:32.859
Life's goddamn complicated.

01:35:36.565 --> 01:35:37.531
All right?

01:35:37.532 --> 01:35:38.498
I haven't seen my
kids in three days.

01:35:41.269 --> 01:35:42.635
Can you even imagine that?

01:35:44.005 --> 01:35:45.371
- No.

01:35:45.373 --> 01:35:46.740
I can't.

01:35:46.742 --> 01:35:48.041
It must be rough for you.

01:35:56.551 --> 01:35:58.952
- I just want to get drunk.

01:35:58.954 --> 01:36:01.921
(people chatting)

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:10.230
- There's no shame in it.

01:36:10.232 --> 01:36:11.264
- No shame in what?

01:36:12.667 --> 01:36:13.500
- In them.

01:36:15.237 --> 01:36:16.102
- Hi.

01:36:20.308 --> 01:36:22.208
- I recognize you, Michael.

01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:22.909
- Yeah.

01:36:26.114 --> 01:36:27.013
- So?

01:36:28.150 --> 01:36:29.816
How long have you
two been together?

01:36:31.286 --> 01:36:32.318
- Me and her?
- Mm-hmm.

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:33.586
- [Michael] A few months.

01:36:34.956 --> 01:36:37.657
- Me and Cameron have been
together for almost a year.

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.461
- It'll be a year in 21 days.

01:36:43.632 --> 01:36:45.698
- So I see you've got
yourself an eMate.

01:36:46.935 --> 01:36:47.867
- [Michael] Yeah.

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:53.573
Do you have a boyfriend, too?

01:36:53.575 --> 01:36:55.809
- No, I mean, sometimes.

01:36:55.811 --> 01:36:57.510
Right now, it's
just me and Cameron.

01:36:57.512 --> 01:36:59.145
- Sometimes?

01:36:59.147 --> 01:37:00.413
- Depends on who I meet.

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:02.649
- How?

01:37:03.785 --> 01:37:05.985
- Well, if I meet a
guy and he likes me,

01:37:05.987 --> 01:37:08.087
and he's okay with
me liking Cameron,

01:37:08.089 --> 01:37:10.390
we go out on a date and
see if we're compatible.

01:37:10.392 --> 01:37:11.291
- Sexually?

01:37:12.627 --> 01:37:15.361
- I mean in every way. I mean,
isn't that what dating is?

01:37:17.432 --> 01:37:19.032
- So,

01:37:19.034 --> 01:37:21.434
you meet guys that
are okay with him?

01:37:21.436 --> 01:37:22.468
- Of course.

01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:24.537
I mean, there are so many guys,

01:37:24.539 --> 01:37:26.239
and everybody's not so insecure.

01:37:30.545 --> 01:37:31.444
Women, too.

01:37:33.248 --> 01:37:37.050
Women can be open-minded
if we're given a chance.

01:37:39.654 --> 01:37:43.523
You see, Michael, we women
want exactly what you men want.

01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:48.595
We want happiness,
compassion, a sexy body.

01:37:49.831 --> 01:37:52.966
understanding, a connection,
yada, yada, yada,

01:37:52.968 --> 01:37:54.868
and some respect
mixed in there, too.

01:37:57.205 --> 01:37:58.838
- Open-minded, huh?

01:38:01.243 --> 01:38:03.977
- You'd be surprised at
what people do for love.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.582
(people chatting)
(dramatic music)

01:38:12.888 --> 01:38:13.887
- All right.

01:38:16.958 --> 01:38:19.392
- [Waitress] Heineken,
Beck's, and Budweiser,

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:20.860
Rosenhof, Coor's Light--

01:38:20.862 --> 01:38:23.696
(dramatic music)

01:39:38.907 --> 01:39:40.540
Hey, come to the garage.

01:39:41.743 --> 01:39:43.509
Because I need to talk
to you, Brooke, just

01:39:43.511 --> 01:39:44.544
come to the garage.

01:39:46.448 --> 01:39:48.214
No, because I can't
come in right now.

01:39:48.216 --> 01:39:50.917
All right, you'll see, just
come down and talk to me.

01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:53.252
(dramatic music)

01:39:53.254 --> 01:39:55.321
Come talk to me, please.

01:39:56.558 --> 01:39:57.390
Thank you.

01:39:57.392 --> 01:40:00.193
(dramatic music)

01:40:18.046 --> 01:40:21.781
- Are you serious?
- Please just get in the car.

01:40:21.783 --> 01:40:22.982
- You brought your little

01:40:22.984 --> 01:40:24.083
sexbot to our house.
- Please get in the car

01:40:24.085 --> 01:40:26.052
and let me talk to you.
- Okay, okay.

01:40:30.392 --> 01:40:32.325
- I see, you got an upgrade.

01:40:32.327 --> 01:40:34.093
Congratulations, this is good.

01:40:36.831 --> 01:40:38.431
Talk!

01:40:38.433 --> 01:40:40.400
- All right, you want
to know the truth?

01:40:40.402 --> 01:40:43.136
You wanna know the honest
truth about why she's here?

01:40:44.205 --> 01:40:46.873
It's 'cause I'm not
ready to give up on yet.

01:40:46.875 --> 01:40:50.143
Okay, there is
something broken here,

01:40:50.145 --> 01:40:53.546
and she and other eMates
like her can help us fix it.

01:40:53.548 --> 01:40:54.414
No!

01:40:55.917 --> 01:40:57.950
Never once did you ask me why.

01:40:57.952 --> 01:40:59.752
- Why what?
- Why I had her built.

01:40:59.754 --> 01:41:01.220
You just yelled at
me, and berated me

01:41:01.222 --> 01:41:03.356
and judged me.
- I don't care why.

01:41:03.358 --> 01:41:04.824
You cheated on me with a robot!

01:41:04.826 --> 01:41:06.492
- You cheated on
me with a human!

01:41:11.232 --> 01:41:12.498
Jesus Christ, Brooke.

01:41:13.535 --> 01:41:14.834
You think I wouldn't know

01:41:16.604 --> 01:41:17.970
that when you crawl in
bed with me at night,

01:41:17.972 --> 01:41:19.972
I wouldn't smell
him on your skin?

01:41:21.142 --> 01:41:22.708
- All right, why didn't
you say something?

01:41:22.710 --> 01:41:25.178
- Because I didn't want
you to feel like I felt.

01:41:26.581 --> 01:41:28.448
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:29.549
- No.

01:41:29.551 --> 01:41:30.983
Don't apologize.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.287
Look, that's what
she's taught me.

01:41:35.557 --> 01:41:37.156
We shouldn't have to
apologize for what we want.

01:41:37.158 --> 01:41:39.392
We sure as hell shouldn't
have to apologize for

01:41:39.394 --> 01:41:40.960
what we need to be fulfilled.

01:41:40.962 --> 01:41:43.262
Clearly, we're not doing
that for each other.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:46.599
- Okay, why?

01:41:47.836 --> 01:41:48.768
- Why, what?

01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:50.636
- Why did you have Sophia built?

01:41:53.374 --> 01:41:54.907
- I was hurt.

01:41:54.909 --> 01:41:55.808
I was lonely.

01:41:57.412 --> 01:41:58.244
- Michael, but you
have a family--

01:41:58.246 --> 01:41:59.812
- Yeah, I have a family.

01:41:59.814 --> 01:42:00.980
A family that what?

01:42:02.250 --> 01:42:03.382
Am I gonna have
an intellectually

01:42:03.384 --> 01:42:05.384
stimulating conversation
with the kids?

01:42:05.386 --> 01:42:06.819
Are you going to
role play with me?

01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:09.922
- Oh not this again.
- Yeah, this again, Brooke.

01:42:09.924 --> 01:42:11.624
The one person in this world

01:42:12.794 --> 01:42:15.394
who shouldn't berate
me for my fantasies

01:42:15.396 --> 01:42:18.131
is the one person who makes
me feel the most insecure.

01:42:18.133 --> 01:42:19.298
The one person who should just

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.967
listen to me rant about work

01:42:20.969 --> 01:42:24.403
is the one who makes me
feel like I'm burdening her.

01:42:24.405 --> 01:42:26.939
- I'm sorry, but not everybody
has the same interests.

01:42:26.941 --> 01:42:31.477
- But we do have the same
interest, Brooke: love.

01:42:31.479 --> 01:42:34.380
Till death do us part,
and I'm not dead yet.

01:42:36.651 --> 01:42:37.550
Look.

01:42:38.753 --> 01:42:40.620
You wanna build your own eMate?

01:42:40.622 --> 01:42:42.522
Someone to talk shop with?

01:42:42.524 --> 01:42:44.290
Someone to get you
all hot and bothered

01:42:44.292 --> 01:42:45.625
when all I wanna do is sleep?

01:42:45.627 --> 01:42:47.293
Fine, do it.

01:42:47.295 --> 01:42:49.629
I don't care, I'm not
intimidated by that.

01:42:49.631 --> 01:42:51.097
You know why?

01:42:51.099 --> 01:42:54.800
Because I love you more
than I love the idea of her.

01:42:54.802 --> 01:42:57.103
At the end of the day,
that's all they are.

01:42:57.105 --> 01:42:59.305
The idea of a
perfect relationship.

01:42:59.307 --> 01:43:02.575
- So, why have her?

01:43:02.577 --> 01:43:03.476
Why have her?

01:43:05.013 --> 01:43:07.180
- To be all the things
that we don't want to be.

01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:11.851
Babysitter, dish
washer, house cleaner,

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:14.353
a massager,

01:43:16.191 --> 01:43:17.089
a listener.

01:43:18.726 --> 01:43:20.459
Amber the eager voice actress.

01:43:22.664 --> 01:43:25.898
You'd be surprised at what
you can program them to do.

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:27.733
And they won't judge you.

01:43:27.735 --> 01:43:32.805
They don't see gender, color,
shape, size, they just...

01:43:33.908 --> 01:43:36.175
They do what you ask
them to with pleasure.

01:43:39.247 --> 01:43:41.647
- Why aren't we
enough for each other?

01:43:41.649 --> 01:43:43.916
- Brooke, if we were meant
to be enough for each other,

01:43:43.918 --> 01:43:45.618
God would've never
been invented.

01:43:46.487 --> 01:43:48.888
(laughing)

01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:52.491
She listened to me rant about
that for three hours one day,

01:43:53.895 --> 01:43:54.493
and it felt amazing.

01:43:58.233 --> 01:43:59.999
What would you
love to rant about?

01:44:01.402 --> 01:44:03.936
- How no one prepares you
for how hard marriage is.

01:44:08.676 --> 01:44:10.076
- She would love to listen,

01:44:11.512 --> 01:44:13.145
and she'll keep it a secret.

01:44:14.716 --> 01:44:16.682
- No, no more secrets.

01:44:22.690 --> 01:44:25.424
(mellow music)

01:44:26.894 --> 01:44:29.729
So I can make mine
look however I want?

01:44:29.731 --> 01:44:30.896
- Absolutely.

01:44:30.898 --> 01:44:33.532
(mellow music)

01:44:52.887 --> 01:44:55.788
(orchestra music)

01:45:25.086 --> 01:45:29.088
(transitions to upbeat music)
