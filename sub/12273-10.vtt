WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:04.305
(siren wails, horn blares)

00:19.820 --> 00:21.689
(clattering in distance)

00:27.295 --> 00:30.098
(woman shrieks, laughs)

00:41.875 --> 00:44.078
(steam hissing)

00:58.359 --> 01:00.060
Thanks.

01:16.210 --> 01:19.280
(music playing,
people talking and laughing)

01:19.313 --> 01:20.748
WOMAN:
I like your tie.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.286
It's really nice.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.155
MAN:
Thanks.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.294
Get him out
of here! Out!

01:39.300 --> 01:40.468
What'll it be, hon?

01:40.501 --> 01:42.303
Dirty martini.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.372
Sorry, no vodka tonight,
but you look like

01:44.405 --> 01:46.874
you could be
a sloe gin fizz kinda girl.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.743
I can be whatever
you want me to be.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.253
How we doing?

01:59.287 --> 02:00.854
Amazing. Movin' and groovin'.

02:00.888 --> 02:01.689
Receipts looking good?

02:01.722 --> 02:04.358
Come on, buddy.
Are you kidding me?

02:04.392 --> 02:06.460
Will you just relax?
Look at this place.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.329
I'd say
we're doing good.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.667
(patrons exclaim)

02:13.701 --> 02:14.802
(all cheering)

02:14.835 --> 02:17.705
(rock music plays)

02:30.918 --> 02:34.188
* I want to taste your love

02:34.222 --> 02:37.291
* Keep me coming back for more

02:37.325 --> 02:40.728
* I want to get some love

02:40.761 --> 02:44.932
* Come on and give me more

02:44.965 --> 02:48.702
* I want to keep on coming

02:48.736 --> 02:52.406
* I want to try something new

02:52.440 --> 02:55.609
Whoo!
* I want to get some loving

02:55.643 --> 02:59.780
* If it's the last thing I do

02:59.813 --> 03:03.951
* I want to taste your love

03:03.984 --> 03:07.421
* Keep coming back for more

03:07.455 --> 03:11.825
* Want to get some love

03:11.859 --> 03:13.861
* Come on and give me more

03:15.463 --> 03:18.198
* Come on
and give me more *

03:19.567 --> 03:22.403
* Come on and give me more

03:22.436 --> 03:26.707
* Come on
and give me more *

03:26.740 --> 03:29.277
* Come on and give me more

03:30.344 --> 03:31.579
(howls)

03:31.612 --> 03:35.416
* Whoo... whoo-ooh

03:37.818 --> 03:42.590
* Whoo... whoo-ooh

03:44.958 --> 03:49.730
* Whoo... whoo-ooh.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.765
(music fades)

03:53.033 --> 03:55.336
CHRISTINE:
Hey, I never asked you.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.605
How did your doctor's
appointment go yesterday?

03:57.638 --> 04:02.610
He said I'm showing
signs of improvement.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.877
Sailing through my tests

04:03.911 --> 04:06.380
and getting better
all the time.
(chuckles)

04:06.414 --> 04:08.949
Couldn't have done
it without you.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.289
Mmm, this is nice.

04:15.323 --> 04:18.559
You, me,
a quiet moment.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.927
Mm-hmm.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.029
I can see us here
years from now

04:22.062 --> 04:24.398
sitting on our bench...

04:24.432 --> 04:26.567
wrinkly, gray.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.502
You'll be all crotchety,
of course.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.037
(both laugh)

04:30.070 --> 04:31.472
What's the fun
of getting older

04:31.505 --> 04:33.941
if you can't be crotchety?

04:38.078 --> 04:40.648
(phone ringing)

04:43.951 --> 04:45.853
Go on. Get it.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.963
Taylor.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.935
(siren wails briefly)

05:01.969 --> 05:05.773
Lot owner says he closed up
at 10:00 p.m. last night.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.341
Showed up at 6:00 a.m.,

05:07.375 --> 05:08.742
found our vic
shortly thereafter.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.678
DANVILLE:
Well, not the kind
of Christmas surprise

05:10.711 --> 05:12.846
that poor man was expecting,
I'm sure.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.585
FLACK:
The vic is Jason Black,
28 years old.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.620
Blunt force trauma.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.622
Also...

05:26.126 --> 05:27.695
DANVILLE:
Ow.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.531
Any sign of what was used
to hit him in the head?

05:30.564 --> 05:33.401
No. But I have
a pretty good idea why.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.234
Bank deposit bag.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.504
Ten grand was taken off
of our vic.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.805
So he was robbed.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.072
Yeah, kinda.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.641
How do you kinda rob someone?

05:40.674 --> 05:43.811
You leave $5,328 behind.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.548
His wallet, credit cards,
untouched.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.650
Why robs someone and not take
all the money?

05:52.185 --> 05:55.723
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

06:12.172 --> 06:17.144
* Out here in the fields

06:17.177 --> 06:20.047
* I fight for my meals

06:20.080 --> 06:25.786
* I get my back into my living

06:28.155 --> 06:30.390
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.667
(camera shutter clicking)

06:45.038 --> 06:48.709
Foot tread would indicate our
vic was kicked in the chest.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.812
Probably the force that sent him
back onto the spike.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.748
Yeah, it's just hard to tell

06:54.782 --> 06:56.484
if it was intentional
or accidental.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.019
The blunt force trauma?
Nothing accidental about that.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.655
TAYLOR:
Medium-velocity spatter.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.890
Yeah, our vic took

07:02.923 --> 07:04.925
quite a beating
before landing on the spike.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.796
If a body falls in a fake
forest, does it make a noise?

07:08.829 --> 07:10.230
Apparently not.
Canvass of the area

07:10.263 --> 07:11.599
turned up zilch.
No witnesses,

07:11.632 --> 07:12.600
no surveillance cameras.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.101
And the lot owner?

07:14.134 --> 07:15.202
His alibi checks out.

07:15.235 --> 07:18.472
The business on the deposit
slip, The Real McCoy.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.074
Yeah, it's a super exclusive
speakeasy up the street.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.210
Opened up about two years ago.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.579
Our vic was one
of the co-owners.

07:25.613 --> 07:26.847
Personally,
I don't get the appeal.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.016
20 bucks for a specialty drink?
Give me a beer

07:29.049 --> 07:30.618
and call it a day, thanks.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.520
It's nostalgic.
So nostalgic

07:32.553 --> 07:34.988
that the bar keeps everything
old school from

07:35.022 --> 07:36.857
its drinks to the
"cash only" policy.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.826
Over 15 grand.
Must have been the

07:38.859 --> 07:39.960
end-of-the-week deposit.
There's a bank

07:39.993 --> 07:41.128
drop-off two blocks from here.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.796
He ends up here.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.634
I found a piece of fabric on
the front gate, matches our

07:46.667 --> 07:48.068
vic's coat.
I'm thinking maybe he ducked

07:48.101 --> 07:49.737
in here to hide
from whoever

07:49.770 --> 07:52.172
eventually caught up with him.
Or someone
forced him in.

07:52.205 --> 07:55.809
You're gonna rob someone,
the best bet is to get
'em off the street.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.645
But if it's just a stickup,

07:57.678 --> 08:00.948
why go to all the trouble of
squeezing into a locked lot?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.624
Hey.
Where do you think
you're going?

08:10.658 --> 08:14.161
Hey, babe.
I didn't mean to wake you.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.664
Mm.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.567
It's way too early
to be functional.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.935
I don't have
rehearsal till 2:00.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.605
I know,
but I gotta go.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.206
I thought you had the day off.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.942
I do.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.780
Adam, we need to talk.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.883
Okay.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.951
This isn't gonna work out.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.787
What?

08:39.820 --> 08:42.956
It's been a fun few months,
and you're cute and all and...

08:42.990 --> 08:45.693
mildly intellectually
stimulating,

08:45.726 --> 08:50.097
but if you're gonna insist on
being a morning person, then...

08:50.130 --> 08:52.065
(laughs)

08:53.867 --> 08:56.770
Oh, way to give a guy
a heart attack.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.839
(both chuckle)

08:58.872 --> 09:02.142
Mm, I would actually love
to stimulate you

09:02.175 --> 09:06.747
with my mild intellect,
but, uh, um...

09:06.780 --> 09:09.983
Oh, I can't believe I'm saying
this right now. I-I gotta go.

09:10.017 --> 09:14.588
You have no idea how much
I hate myself.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.757
No idea.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.759
At around 1:00...
Yeah?

09:18.792 --> 09:20.994
you're gonna be overcome
with a particular feeling.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.062
Oh.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.666
That feeling is going to be
overwhelming regret.

09:25.699 --> 09:29.703
So you should reconsider this
whole responsibility thing

09:29.737 --> 09:31.739
you've got going on.
Yeah.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.875
Yes, yes, yes.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.343
Yes, but I gotta go.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.878
Where are you going?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.680
Um, Hyperion House.

09:39.713 --> 09:43.884
It-it's a nursing home that
I sometimes volunteer at.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.285
Okay,

09:45.318 --> 09:47.621
now I'm overcome
with regret.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.790
I knew you were one
of the good ones.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.792
(chuckles)

09:51.825 --> 09:53.360
Thanks.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.095
Bye.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.037
TAYLOR:
Jason was your boyfriend?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.272
Almost a year.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.075
Typical story.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.343
Best friends who became more.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.045
We've known each other
since college.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.180
Eli, too?

10:13.213 --> 10:16.817
Used to call them
Yin and Yang.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.219
They were total opposites,

10:19.252 --> 10:21.121
but together,
they just kinda worked.

10:21.154 --> 10:25.793
Despite being opposites,
Jason and Eli got along?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.094
He was my best friend...

10:27.127 --> 10:31.832
since second grade.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.267
I can't imagine things
without him.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.704
Not many friendships survive
going into business together.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.972
We had our moments.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.674
He was always quick to anger,

10:40.708 --> 10:42.943
and I've always been
a little too passive.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.813
How about Courtney,
how'd she fit in?

10:45.846 --> 10:47.114
Started off as a dancer.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.982
I mean, still am.
But as things got

10:49.016 --> 10:51.018
more hectic
around here,

10:51.051 --> 10:54.154
they had me start helping
with the day-to-day.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.356
There was a good portion of cash
taken from Jason.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.359
Do you know if he had any
money problems recently?

10:59.392 --> 11:00.994
He liked to gamble.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.462
He always took
the risky bet, but...

11:02.495 --> 11:04.765
How risky?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.166
I guess risky's relative.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.702
I was a stats major,

11:08.736 --> 11:10.437
so I always saw the odds;

11:10.470 --> 11:12.105
the risk/reward
of it all.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.807
Jason just saw the reward?
Yeah.

11:13.841 --> 11:17.945
I mean, this bar had
been our dream.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.814
Jason's grandpa, he'd worked
at a speakeasy back in the day,

11:20.848 --> 11:22.382
so we grew up hearing
stories

11:22.415 --> 11:24.184
all about it
all the time:

11:24.217 --> 11:27.020
Club Durant, The Hollywood,
The Ha-Ha Club. It was exciting.

11:27.054 --> 11:31.091
We wanted to replicate
that feeling.

11:31.124 --> 11:34.161
Share an experience,
offer an escape.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.163
What about the exclusivity
of the bar?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.231
That only made people
want it more.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.001
That could've pissed
some people off.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.103
Jason have problems
with anyone recently?

11:43.136 --> 11:47.274
He was the life force
of this place.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.509
People came to see him.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.145
Everybody loved him.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.449
*

12:32.419 --> 12:34.788
*

12:39.827 --> 12:42.029
The screw from the tree stand

12:42.062 --> 12:44.331
pierced the left external
carotid artery

12:44.364 --> 12:46.333
and the left
jugular vein.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.069
Official COD
exsanguination.

12:49.102 --> 12:53.206
Liver temp places TOD
around 4:00 a.m.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.208
What about the lacerations?

12:55.242 --> 12:58.378
Two horizontal puncture wounds

12:58.411 --> 13:01.214
and one in which the skin split

13:01.248 --> 13:04.017
and caused
three radiating tears.

13:04.051 --> 13:07.520
Given the shapes and the ragged
look of the laceration,

13:07.554 --> 13:09.256
I'd say our vic was
pistol-whipped.

13:09.289 --> 13:13.460
The blunt end,
the corner of the handle.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.963
Subdermal photos
confirm it.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.599
Probably a small gun,
given the shape and size.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.434
So our perp used a gun,

13:21.468 --> 13:23.871
but never fired it.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.339
Also, I collected trace
from the wound.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.841
Sent it up to the lab.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.410
What is this mark
below the temple?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.280
Hmm.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.983
DANVILLE:
Might lead us
to the weapon.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.955
MAN:
All right, here we go.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.894
Yoo-hoo.

13:46.927 --> 13:47.827
Huh?

13:47.861 --> 13:50.030
We're playing a game here.
It's your turn.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.232
You got to take
seven tiles.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.534
Oh. Sorry about that.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.369
It's okay.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.908
There you go.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.443
I got it!
Okay.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.048
Hey.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.890
You know that kid?

14:16.924 --> 14:19.292
I thought maybe it was my son.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.228
I don't know why.
He never visits.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.197
I wouldn't either, I guess.
Place is disgusting.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.135
You're a good brother, Brian.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.302
I'm...

14:29.336 --> 14:32.039
No one else visits
me, just you.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.041
How's the family?
You need money?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.308
Remember...

14:35.342 --> 14:36.443
Always be saving.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.211
Ah-huh.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.617
What's wrong?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.286
You see, you see
that woman, huh?

14:46.319 --> 14:47.687
I'd give you
a few bucks

14:47.720 --> 14:50.057
but she keeps stealing my
wallet. That's why you

14:50.090 --> 14:51.959
always gotta be careful.
I don't like the people

14:51.992 --> 14:54.227
who hang around here.
They're just trying to help you.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.097
Yeah, just trying to help
themselves to my money.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.233
Uh...

15:02.435 --> 15:03.937
Can you hold on one second?

15:06.373 --> 15:07.941
There you are.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.009
What are you doing here?

15:09.042 --> 15:11.178
I wanted to see you
in your element.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.946
Thought I'd surprise you
with a little pick-me-up.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.948
Maybe help out?

15:14.982 --> 15:17.617
Uh, I mean, that's really sweet

15:17.650 --> 15:22.389
and I really appreciate it.
Just, um, I'm busy.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.963
Oh, no.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.637
Where the hell did he go?

15:48.415 --> 15:49.983
*

16:21.381 --> 16:23.250
Hey, you're gonna get a wrinkle

16:23.283 --> 16:25.218
if you keep furrowing
your brow like that.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.653
This just doesn't make sense.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.421
What?
I found blood

16:28.455 --> 16:30.623
on the vic's watch.
You were there,

16:30.657 --> 16:34.494
you saw; the jacket was securely
around the gloves.

16:34.527 --> 16:38.098
Yeah, the watch was
completely covered.
Yeah.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.699
So where'd this blood come from?

16:39.732 --> 16:42.169
(computer beeps)

16:50.377 --> 16:51.744
(indistinct chatter)

17:17.369 --> 17:19.106
(people shouting)

17:19.138 --> 17:20.339
FLACK:
All right, hey!

17:26.512 --> 17:27.579
(grunts)

17:31.118 --> 17:34.087
That's a catch of the day.

17:41.461 --> 17:44.131
Petty theft,
armed robbery, burglary.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.399
You were pinched five years ago
for third-degree robbery.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.535
You're out of prison
for a week

17:48.568 --> 17:50.370
and you're already back at it?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.239
I don't know what you guys
are talking about.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.173
I'll paint you a picture.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.108
You get out of prison,
times are tough...

17:55.142 --> 17:56.543
You want to get back
on your feet...

17:56.576 --> 17:58.311
FLACK:
You find an easy mark--
Jason Black.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.546
Name ring a bell?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.214
I don't know who that is.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.116
Yeah, you do.
It's a pretty good theory.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.717
A theory supported by the fact

18:04.751 --> 18:07.254
that we have your blood
on our victim's watch.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.456
Theory sound more like fact now?

18:10.823 --> 18:13.126
Guy was a douche.

18:13.160 --> 18:17.397
I found a way into his
pretentious exclusive club.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.866
I try to order a drink,
the ass has me thrown out.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.501
Come on.
Get out of here.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.802
Get your hands
off of me!

18:22.835 --> 18:24.404
Left a pretty good mark, too.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.905
What kind of place

18:25.938 --> 18:28.208
refuses business just 'cause
I don't look the part?

18:28.241 --> 18:30.143
It doesn't sound like
your kind of joint.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.212
Just like you said.
I'm out of prison a week.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.780
I got a taste
for bourbon.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.382
It's as simple
as that.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.349
Just a random bar.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.851
Of all the watering holes in all
of New York,

18:38.885 --> 18:41.488
you had to walk into that one?

18:41.521 --> 18:44.291
Doesn't feel random.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.326
Plus, you're on parole,
which means...

18:46.359 --> 18:49.196
Which means the only thing I did
wrong was try

18:49.229 --> 18:51.531
and get a drink in that bar.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.174
MAN:
There's no reason
for this!

19:01.208 --> 19:02.442
None! I want to go home.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.477
Look, I don't
know who you are,

19:04.511 --> 19:06.613
but I demand to speak
to your supervisor!

19:06.646 --> 19:09.516
I got this, I got this.
Hey, it's okay. Take a breath.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.817
You!

19:10.850 --> 19:12.685
You're behind this,
aren't you, Adam?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.554
I should have known!

19:14.587 --> 19:16.289
Always trying
to ruin things for me!

19:16.323 --> 19:17.557
You know who I am?

19:17.590 --> 19:18.691
Of course I do.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.227
Look, I got a call from the cops
saying they found you.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.228
I'm just gonna take you home.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.595
That's where I was trying to go

19:22.629 --> 19:24.464
before you had me hauled off.
You did this!

19:24.497 --> 19:26.499
I didn't do anything!
I want to go home.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.236
I need to go home.
Do you understand?

19:29.269 --> 19:30.770
I do, but do you know
where home is?

19:30.803 --> 19:32.205
Don't be silly! Arizona!

19:32.239 --> 19:34.441
We're in New York City.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.842
Don't tell me where I am.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.779
Okay, look, let's just,
let's just go home.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.314
You are such a
disappointment!

19:41.348 --> 19:43.850
Always have been,
always will be.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.318
A good-for-nothing!

19:45.352 --> 19:46.919
Trying to put me
away, huh?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.988
Trying to hurt me.

19:49.021 --> 19:53.526
I haven't seen you for years,
and this is when you show up?!

19:53.560 --> 19:56.463
This is how
you repay me?!

19:56.496 --> 19:58.398
Huh?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.935
Can you put him in
an interview room, please?

20:03.936 --> 20:06.706
Come back here, Adam! Adam?!

20:07.707 --> 20:09.242
Adam!

20:09.276 --> 20:11.010
What's going on?
Is that guy okay?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.613
Yeah. No.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.283
My dad has Alzheimer's.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.618
What did you say?

20:18.651 --> 20:20.920
He's my dad.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.703
Hey, Jo. Turns out
you were right.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.638
Oh, I love
those three words.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.307
What was I right
about this time?

20:40.340 --> 20:41.841
Subdermal bruising on
the vic's face.

20:41.874 --> 20:46.413
The insignia is the trademark
for Dunley Ballistics.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.352
(computer beeps, trills)

20:55.888 --> 20:56.923
The perp's gun.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.691
Yeah, but not
just any gun.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.859
A starter pistol.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.494
They use those
at my kids' swim meet.

21:01.528 --> 21:02.495
It only fire blanks or caps.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.664
Looks just like the real McCoy,
but far from it.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.832
Probably just wanted
to scare the vic

21:05.865 --> 21:07.033
into giving up the money.

21:07.066 --> 21:10.770
Still doesn't explain why our
perp only grabbed $10,000.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.739
Hmm.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.007
(computer beeps)
Ah! Okay,

21:15.041 --> 21:18.545
cotton, indigo, foil,
boric acid.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.047
Trace that Sid collected
from the wound of our vic.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.384
Okay. Uh, cotton and indigo...

21:24.417 --> 21:25.752
sounds like denim.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.520
Foil...

21:27.554 --> 21:28.755
But boric acid?

21:28.788 --> 21:33.760
Okay, usually used as an
antiseptic, insecticide,

21:33.793 --> 21:35.628
flame-retardant, lubricant.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.529
Any number of things.

21:36.563 --> 21:40.400
Uh! I expected so much more
from you.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.515
Hey, Flack, I got
your text. What's up?

21:55.548 --> 21:58.585
Since we don't have anything
else to go at Nathan Brody with,

21:58.618 --> 22:00.420
I've been looking
over complaint reports

22:00.453 --> 22:02.054
from the area around
The Real McCoy.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.691
Able to I.D. any sort
of robbery pattern?

22:04.724 --> 22:05.758
Not yet.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.395
What I did find, though,
is an unusually high number

22:08.428 --> 22:10.630
of disorderly conduct
and public intox.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.599
14 incidents in the last month,

22:12.632 --> 22:15.001
and only three others in
the two years they've been open.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.803
That's a pretty
significant spike.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.004
Could be nothing.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.039
Maybe the bar was
just over-serving.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.443
The vic's tox report

22:23.476 --> 22:24.977
said he had a buildup
of formic acid

22:25.011 --> 22:27.714
in his system.

22:27.747 --> 22:28.715
When ingested, methanol

22:28.748 --> 22:31.117
quickly converts
to formaldehyde,

22:31.150 --> 22:33.085
and then to formic acid.
Okay.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.153
So what are you thinking, here?

22:34.186 --> 22:39.426
That maybe the bar isn't
just a speakeasy by name.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.664
Chocolate malt shake.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.998
(chuckles)

22:46.032 --> 22:47.467
My favorite.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.468
How did you know?

22:48.501 --> 22:50.670
Just a good guess.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.045
Do you know where
you are right now?

22:59.078 --> 23:02.148
Uh... no.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.158
Do you remember
anything about today?

23:12.191 --> 23:15.027
Um... I went to, um...

23:16.563 --> 23:19.131
I, um... I was looking for,
um, for my wife.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.701
Um... she wasn't home,
so I, uh...

23:21.734 --> 23:25.004
I went out for a walk,
to uh, to-to find her.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.039
She leaves a lot.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.647
You okay?

23:35.648 --> 23:38.485
Where was that
when I was a kid?

23:38.518 --> 23:41.621
Huh? You got to speak up
if you want to be heard.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.756
You know, you remind
me of my boy?

23:43.790 --> 23:46.125
Sweet. But, uh...

23:46.158 --> 23:47.594
a little soft.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.629
I try to toughen him up. Yeah.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.520
Who am I?

24:16.222 --> 24:17.857
What kind of question is that?

24:17.890 --> 24:19.225
It's so frustrating, how I...

24:19.258 --> 24:22.028
I have you for five minutes,
and then I lose you again.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.632
Who am I?

24:25.665 --> 24:27.066
Say my name.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.538
Brian.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.672
That's your brother.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.006
Charles.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.808
That's you.
I'm Charles?

24:35.842 --> 24:37.243
Yeah.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.981
Dad.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.851
Say my name.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.758
I don't... I don't know.

24:53.793 --> 24:54.961
I'm Adam.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.931
I'm your son.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.270
*

25:33.332 --> 25:35.534
*

25:54.320 --> 25:56.322
(bad English accent):
I'd like a martini,
shaken, not stirred.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.190
Yeah, and preferably
one with ethanol.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.160
Not that I don't like an excuse
to come see you, babe,

26:01.193 --> 26:02.962
but what's up?
Based on Mac's theory

26:02.995 --> 26:05.164
that our speakeasy
is not just a speakeasy,

26:05.197 --> 26:07.033
I tested all the alcohol.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.601
And you found methanol.
Yeah.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.870
Only not in any of
the bottles out here,

26:10.903 --> 26:12.805
only in a few in the stockroom.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.774
So the real stuff is
here on the shelves,

26:14.807 --> 26:15.975
the fake stuff's in the back.

26:16.008 --> 26:16.776
Any idea why?

26:16.809 --> 26:18.711
Well, I think it
was a recent change.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.913
They have been serving
the counterfeit stuff, see?

26:20.947 --> 26:22.982
The rubber mat gives it away.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.184
Methanol corrodes rubber,

26:25.217 --> 26:26.385
pulls moisture out of the air

26:26.418 --> 26:27.954
and turns it into
a white powder.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.657
Mm. I love it when you
talk sciencey to me, baby.

26:30.690 --> 26:31.924
Hmm.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.059
Votova Vodka.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.194
That's the stuff
with the methanol.

26:35.227 --> 26:39.131
So this is a modern-day
bootlegging operation going on.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.267
Yeah, only during Prohibition
people were so desperate

26:41.300 --> 26:43.202
they were drinking
pure ethyl alcohol.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.937
That's like
swigging aftershave.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.073
This stuff is a lot slicker.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.241
It's less detectable, but
it's not any less dangerous.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.010
Yeah, but it's
essentially poison.

26:51.043 --> 26:54.146
It gives you a mild reaction
similar to extreme drunkenness,

26:54.180 --> 26:56.382
but it's dangerous
enough to kill you.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.151
So maybe our vic figured out

26:59.185 --> 27:01.253
that people were selling him
a fake product.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.090
We need to find out who this
bar was buying from.
Yeah.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.925
If it didn't kill him,

27:05.958 --> 27:08.627
it could be what got him killed.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.106
Votova Vodka?

27:20.139 --> 27:22.108
You want to pass off
fake vodka as legit,

27:22.141 --> 27:23.242
I'd come up with
a better name.

27:23.275 --> 27:26.345
Feel free to fill out a
complaint card on your way out.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.814
Yo. Listen to me.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.249
Between us, the Feds,
ICC and ATF,

27:30.282 --> 27:31.250
you're screwed, my man.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.786
You sold counterfeit vodka
to The Real McCoy.

27:33.820 --> 27:34.787
And Jason Black
figured out your scam.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.022
Please.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.123
I'm scamming no one.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.258
Running a business
is expensive.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.227
Clearly, they're looking
to cut corners.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.862
And you were happy to oblige.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.131
That's usually what you do
when you run a business.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.332
Jason confronted you about the
fake booze you were selling him.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.133
He didn't want to pay.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.168
Yeah, he confronted me,
all right.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.470
Whoa.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.740
No way, man.
Not gonna happen.

27:53.773 --> 27:54.874
I'm not selling
your crap anymore.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.276
What are you talking about?
I know what you're up to.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.846
Dude, I'm just trying to
drop off your order.
Hey.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.948
I mix drinks for a living.
You think I can't tell

28:01.981 --> 28:04.250
you've been selling me
this counterfeit vodka?
Yeah, I'm selling it to you

28:04.283 --> 28:05.918
'cause that's what
you've been ordering.
Well, that's impossible.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.223
Look, this guy
didn't have a clue.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.792
He didn't handle the P.O.s.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.927
He refused to pay;
he sent me on my way.

28:14.961 --> 28:15.795
So you killed him.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.229
You took what
you thought he owed you.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.297
No.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.499
I told him he was
bitching at the wrong person.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.035
Okay. So who handles
the purchase orders?

28:23.069 --> 28:25.304
Ah, the manager.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.605
The broad, Courtney.

28:30.476 --> 28:33.045
TAYLOR:
You lied to us, Courtney.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.847
Relationships are
built on trust.

28:34.881 --> 28:38.450
Jason trusted you,
and you betrayed that trust.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.186
LINDSAY:
You were stocking the bar

28:40.219 --> 28:41.487
with counterfeit vodka.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.122
I didn't think anyone
was gonna get hurt.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.123
TAYLOR:
Jason found out,

28:44.156 --> 28:45.825
confronted you,
and then what?

28:45.858 --> 28:46.926
Then nothing.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.795
LINDSAY:
Come on, Courtney,
enough with the lies.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.496
You killed Jason
to keep your secret safe.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.064
Then you used the money

28:52.098 --> 28:53.465
to pay off your
liquor distributor.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.234
No.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.203
No, I loved Jason.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.173
Want a drink?

29:01.207 --> 29:03.509
It's a little early to be
drinking, don't you think, babe?

29:03.542 --> 29:04.543
Nah, have a sip.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.145
What's with you?

29:06.178 --> 29:08.480
Do it.
It's noon.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.250
So it wouldn't be because
it's counterfeit vodka?

29:13.285 --> 29:15.988
Jason, I was gonna tell you.
I'm...
No.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.256
No, no, no. Stop.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.524
You put me at risk.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.193
You put the bar at risk.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.829
What were you thinking?

29:22.862 --> 29:23.996
I was just trying to help.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.998
We're barely making enough money
to stay afloat as it is...

29:27.934 --> 29:29.802
Baby, I'm so sorry.
Don't.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.038
Jason didn't
look at the books.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.806
He didn't know.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.543
He was... he was never
any good with money.

29:37.576 --> 29:40.512
Eli told me that we had to
start finding ways of saving.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.548
We had to cut back.
TAYLOR:
And you two

29:42.581 --> 29:44.483
kept the bar's money
problems from Jason?

29:44.516 --> 29:46.886
Eli thought it would be best.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.254
So Eli knew about the alcohol?

29:48.287 --> 29:50.990
No, I did that on my own.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.961
How did you leave
things with Jason?

29:54.994 --> 29:57.997
He said he needed time.

30:03.335 --> 30:06.338
Now time is something
we can't get back.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.316
Your arm hurt?

30:17.349 --> 30:20.419
Yeah. Ever since I broke it,
I can always tell

30:20.452 --> 30:21.553
when the weather's gonna change.

30:21.587 --> 30:22.554
I can feel it.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.356
When did you break your arm?

30:24.390 --> 30:26.025
You were there.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.294
Remember?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.195
There were those, uh...

30:29.228 --> 30:31.330
those two birds that
we wanted to take out?

30:31.363 --> 30:33.565
Man, those girls.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.301
What were their names again?

30:35.334 --> 30:36.435
Oh, that brunette.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.938
What a knockout.
She was something else.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.907
(chuckles)

30:40.940 --> 30:42.574
We just wanted to impress them.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.643
We stole some beers.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.013
Got that old, uh,
that old army blanket,

30:47.046 --> 30:48.180
you know, from the garage.

30:48.214 --> 30:51.951
Packed up the car, and...

30:51.984 --> 30:53.986
there was Dad.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.889
Oh, man, was he pissed.

30:56.923 --> 30:59.325
Remember that?

30:59.358 --> 31:01.928
He was some new shade of red
I'd never seen before.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.497
And it wasn't the belt.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.366
Or the spoon.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.667
Not that time.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.203
Man, he was pissed.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.538
He broke your arm?

31:12.571 --> 31:14.340
Yeah. What are you gonna do?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.542
He would've broke yours, too,

31:16.575 --> 31:18.010
if I hadn't stepped in.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.913
Stupid broken arm.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.215
Ruined my chance
of playing ball.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.653
I could've been great.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.489
Why did you let him hurt you?

31:30.522 --> 31:32.358
What were we, like 15?

31:32.391 --> 31:33.292
What choice did I have?

31:33.325 --> 31:36.162
I mean... did-did he
do it to you often?

31:36.195 --> 31:37.463
Oh, come on.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.431
You don't want to
relive that stuff.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.073
I relive it every day.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.411
I tried for so long to forget
about everything you did to me.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.516
Don't you remember?

31:57.549 --> 32:00.252
No, I... that was Dad,
that wasn't me.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.124
You are my dad.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.329
You kicked the crap out of me.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.430
Look at me.

32:11.463 --> 32:14.266
You look at me.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.304
You tell me you remember.

32:21.407 --> 32:25.277
No, you must have me
confused with someone else.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.557
(keyboard keys clacking)

32:42.728 --> 32:45.231
That's one
complicated-looking map.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.333
But it is the map that
might lead us to our perp.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.568
The trace you ran led to
a ton of possible sources,

32:49.601 --> 32:51.370
one of which:
denim insulation.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.472
Cotton, indigo, foil and...

32:53.505 --> 32:57.076
Boric acid, acting
as a flame-retardant.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.077
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

32:58.110 --> 33:01.180
So maybe our perp kept
his gun in the attic.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.149
Denim insulation
gets on the gun

33:03.182 --> 33:05.117
and transfers to our vic
when he gets hit.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.653
And how does that trace
connect back to this?

33:07.686 --> 33:10.456
It turns out Jason and Eli
worked a slew of odd jobs

33:10.489 --> 33:12.291
before opening The Real McCoy.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.125
They laid denim insulation?

33:13.159 --> 33:14.793
Yeah, right before
they opened the bar,

33:14.826 --> 33:16.328
they worked
for Overhead Roofing.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.264
I took the addresses
of all the jobs

33:18.297 --> 33:20.166
Jason worked,
plugged those in, then

33:20.199 --> 33:21.633
cross-referenced
all the players
in the game

33:21.667 --> 33:24.136
with those address
to see if there
was any link.

33:24.170 --> 33:28.207
Jason's employees,
friends, family.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.376
And finally,
anyone questioned.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.447
DANVILLE:
Nathan Brody.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.784
HAWKES:
Nathan lived at his grandma's
house till he got popped

33:38.817 --> 33:40.052
for third-degree robbery

33:40.086 --> 33:41.220
and hauled off
to prison.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.321
Pulled the file.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.822
His haul was approximated
at ten thou.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.157
That was five years ago.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.292
Money was never recovered?

33:46.325 --> 33:47.326
Not a dime.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.560
When was our vic in the attic?

33:48.594 --> 33:51.663
Date on the insulation job says
a little over two years ago.

33:51.697 --> 33:56.235
Right before
Jason opened the bar.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.270
So if Nathan hid
his gun in the attic,

33:58.304 --> 33:59.505
maybe he hid
his money there, too.

33:59.538 --> 34:03.475
Mm-hmm. Nathan's released, comes
home to find his stash gone.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.777
And somehow fingers
our vic as his thief.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.513
What?

34:10.416 --> 34:14.253
So maybe Jason's dream was built
on a lie.

34:20.826 --> 34:23.362
FLACK:
$10,000. Scary
to think what some

34:23.395 --> 34:25.331
people would do
for that kind of money.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.099
In your case,
you killed for it.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.101
Look, I already told you
what happened, all right?

34:29.135 --> 34:30.001
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.770
That was part one
of a two-part tale.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.105
We know you killed
Jason Black.

34:33.139 --> 34:36.275
We have the gun
you hit him with.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.480
FLACK:
The skeleton in your closet
comes in the form

34:41.513 --> 34:43.315
of a starter pistol
in the attic.

34:43.349 --> 34:44.815
Start talking.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.690
I found the receipt
for the insulation job.

34:51.723 --> 34:52.824
Signed off by Jason Black.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.393
FLACK:
Quick Google search,

34:54.426 --> 34:56.395
you find out
that Jason owns

34:56.428 --> 34:57.796
The Real McCoy.
You snuck in that

34:57.829 --> 35:00.299
night to confront him,
but he booted you out.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.768
Figured if he wouldn't talk
to me at the bar,

35:02.801 --> 35:04.603
I wouldn't let
walking away be an option.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.472
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.674
I've never seen you before,
and I did not take your money.

35:08.707 --> 35:09.875
You were in
my attic, right?

35:09.908 --> 35:11.810
You found my cash,
and I'm here to collect.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.846
(both grunting)

35:20.952 --> 35:23.522
I was gonna leave him,
then he fought back.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.303
So I searched him...

35:37.336 --> 35:40.172
found the deposit bag,
took my money back.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.540
It wasn't yours to begin with.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.509
Think what you want...

35:43.542 --> 35:48.614
but that money was my hope
to start over.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.250
A hope to meet
my kid.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.319
He was born four months after
I went in.

35:53.352 --> 35:57.423
Yo, you were gonna start over
with stolen money?

35:57.456 --> 35:59.791
I just wanted
to do right by him.

35:59.825 --> 36:03.695
Hoist him up on my shoulders
after his first ball game.

36:03.729 --> 36:06.798
Hold his hand on
the way to the barber
for his first haircut,

36:06.832 --> 36:09.635
you know?

36:09.668 --> 36:12.338
Give him better
than my dad gave me.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.273
The sins of the father

36:14.306 --> 36:18.344
are the shackles worn
by their children.

36:18.377 --> 36:22.481
Let's hope your son is able
to break free.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.355
(people chattering)

36:40.499 --> 36:42.634
Tough day?

36:42.668 --> 36:47.639
Yeah. Nothing that a good
night's sleep can't fix.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.242
I saw you with
your father.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.977
You want to talk?

36:53.979 --> 36:55.814
Okay.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.793
You know, I only stood up
to my dad once.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.262
I was 15.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.698
And he, he just got home
from work.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.734
My mom was cooking dinner
in the kitchen.

37:15.767 --> 37:19.705
He started hassling her...
verbally.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.773
Then he pushed her
hard against the wall

37:21.807 --> 37:23.309
and shattered
this picture frame.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.876
My mom starts to cry.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.879
And I could, I could hear
from the living room.

37:30.816 --> 37:34.420
Then he started
to hit her.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.022
And I, I just...

37:37.055 --> 37:38.657
I couldn't listen
to her cry anymore.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.992
So I got up

37:41.026 --> 37:43.362
and I grabbed a piece
of broken glass off the floor

37:43.395 --> 37:46.598
and... I yelled at him
to get off her.

37:46.632 --> 37:50.636
And I said,
"If you ever hurt me

37:50.669 --> 37:54.340
"or her again...

37:54.373 --> 37:55.907
I will kill you."

37:59.611 --> 38:02.514
Why do you go visit him?

38:02.548 --> 38:05.016
I'm his son.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.486
I feel obligated.

38:12.391 --> 38:15.026
Did you take care of your dad
when he was sick?

38:15.060 --> 38:20.766
No, no, my mother did that.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.335
I wish I'd done more.

38:23.369 --> 38:25.937
It's just not fair,
you know?

38:25.971 --> 38:30.409
He doesn't remember anything...

38:30.442 --> 38:32.544
anything that he did to me.

38:32.578 --> 38:36.682
And I remember
every curse,

38:36.715 --> 38:40.552
every smack, every bruise.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.888
Everything.
I remember all of it.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.758
You want an acknowledgement.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.928
Or an apology,

38:49.961 --> 38:53.331
but with his fleeting memory,
you can't have that.

38:55.701 --> 39:01.106
I look at him now,
and he's old... and sick.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.375
And I feel nothing.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.413
And it scares me.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.748
I mean, what does that say
about me as a person?

39:09.781 --> 39:10.582
You know, you're supposed...

39:10.616 --> 39:16.488
you're supposed to love
your parents.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.890
So...

39:23.094 --> 39:27.466
I guess I go
because I want to...

39:27.499 --> 39:30.068
I want to feel something.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.907
It looks like you feel
something now.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.712
Holding onto the anger
isn't gonna help you.

39:40.746 --> 39:43.649
It's so crazy, you know?

39:43.682 --> 39:48.520
I've learned more about him now
since he's been sick

39:48.554 --> 39:52.090
than when
he was normal.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.462
Turns out, he's just another
case of history

39:56.495 --> 39:58.964
repeating itself, you know?

40:01.867 --> 40:03.602
He was a victim, too.

40:06.605 --> 40:09.841
A little forgiveness...
you can move on.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.977
Maybe.

40:12.878 --> 40:15.447
Not just for him, Adam,

40:15.481 --> 40:16.948
for you.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.698
FLACK:
Thought you guys
might want this.

40:32.731 --> 40:34.566
COURTNEY AND ELI:
Thank you.

40:35.701 --> 40:36.835
Detective?

40:38.604 --> 40:39.671
You got the guy?

40:39.705 --> 40:40.839
Yeah.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.774
COURTNEY:
Jason was a
really good man.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.477
Who would want
to hurt him?

40:45.511 --> 40:47.746
It seems the past
came back to haunt him.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.881
Apparently, he stole
ten grand out of someone's attic

40:49.915 --> 40:52.050
when you guys used
to lay insulation.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.489
You said you won it
in Atlantic City.

40:57.523 --> 40:59.891
What're you talking about?

40:59.925 --> 41:01.593
The money.
The last bit

41:01.627 --> 41:02.594
of the start-up money.

41:02.628 --> 41:04.229
You said you won
ten grand in AC.

41:04.262 --> 41:06.264
I did.
No.

41:06.297 --> 41:11.002
No, you laid insulation
with him. You were there.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.671
You took that money.

41:25.551 --> 41:28.186
We were so close

41:28.219 --> 41:30.622
to having everything
that we wanted.

41:30.656 --> 41:32.558
The money was...
it was just sitting there.

41:32.591 --> 41:34.092
It should have been you.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.899
I didn't think
anyone would know.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.534
Or that after all

41:42.568 --> 41:44.670
this time anyone would come
looking for it.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.738
No one ever thinks that.

42:03.922 --> 42:06.191
(chuckles)

42:06.224 --> 42:07.659
What?

42:07.693 --> 42:11.062
Ah, man, uh, I'm gonna regret
saying this,

42:11.096 --> 42:16.768
but I totally understand if you
want to walk away from this.

42:16.802 --> 42:18.069
No hard feelings.

42:18.103 --> 42:20.772
I'm here, aren't I?

42:20.806 --> 42:21.640
I know, I just...

42:21.673 --> 42:23.575
you have to deal
with all this baggage.

42:23.609 --> 42:25.944
We all have baggage.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.049
You just have to find someone

42:31.082 --> 42:33.018
who you want to help
you carry it.

42:35.286 --> 42:37.589
I'm applying for the job.

42:37.623 --> 42:39.625
(chuckles)

42:40.826 --> 42:43.128
Can I play you something?

42:43.161 --> 42:44.663
'Course.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.899
This is the only thing
I have of my dad's.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.601
The only thing I ever wanted.

42:49.635 --> 42:53.739
Favorite memory as a kid was

42:53.772 --> 42:56.174
going to the record store
with him.

43:01.813 --> 43:03.815
(pop song plays)

43:05.951 --> 43:08.286
That'd be another point for you.

43:08.319 --> 43:09.387
(both chuckle)

43:09.420 --> 43:15.226
* I want to spend my life
with a girl like you *

43:15.260 --> 43:16.628
* Ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba

43:16.662 --> 43:19.765
Thank you.

43:19.798 --> 43:23.702
* And do all the things
that you want me to *

43:23.735 --> 43:27.405
* Ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba

43:27.438 --> 43:31.977
* Till that time has come

43:32.010 --> 43:34.379
* That we might live as one

43:34.412 --> 43:36.181
* Gonna dance with you...

43:36.214 --> 43:36.281
