01:08.602 --> 01:10.661
<i>This is car 2118.
Call Greenpoint Hospital.</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:12.671
<i>We're bringing in a wounded cop.</i>

01:14.107 --> 01:15.597
<i>All right, 10-4.</i>

01:25.185 --> 01:26.777
8th Precinct.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.420
Jesus Christ.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.161
Guess who got shot.

01:46.339 --> 01:47.931
Serpico.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.673
You think a cop did it?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.873
I know six cops
said they'd like to.

02:11.698 --> 02:12.892
Hello.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.828
<i>New York Times.
Serpico's been shot.</i>

02:18.205 --> 02:19.729
Oh, my God!

02:19.806 --> 02:21.899
<i>- They're taking him to Greenpoint.
- I'll see you there.</i>

03:49.362 --> 03:52.820
<i>To be a police officer
means to believe in the law...</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:55.367
<i>and to enforce it impartially...</i>

03:55.435 --> 03:57.528
respecting the equality
of all men...

03:57.604 --> 04:00.698
and the dignity and worth
of every individual.

04:02.008 --> 04:05.535
Every day, your life
will be on the line...

04:05.612 --> 04:07.944
and also your character.

04:08.014 --> 04:11.609
You'll need integrity,
courage, honesty...

04:11.685 --> 04:14.745
compassion, courtesy...

04:14.821 --> 04:16.584
and perseverance...

04:16.656 --> 04:18.783
and patience.

04:18.858 --> 04:23.386
You men are now prepared
to join the war against crime...

04:23.463 --> 04:27.263
and put the theory you have learned
into practice in the streets.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.803
Same time, same place...
both reports.

04:38.878 --> 04:41.745
I already made out a 424.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.340
- You covering this, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Chief Green.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.442
Who was with Serpico?

04:46.519 --> 04:49.886
- Heinemann and Julio.
- I want them interrogated.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.686
I want this conducted as an official
departmental investigation.

04:52.759 --> 04:55.091
Transcripts by 9:00 a.m.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.237
Another thing...
I want a 24-hour guard on Serpico.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.573
- Yes, sir.
- You two, over there.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.704
<i>Anthony Sardo.</i>

06:16.309 --> 06:18.243
<i>Ralph Seidler.</i>

06:21.981 --> 06:24.848
Frank Serpico.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.497
Come on.
Marianne wants a good shot.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.134
Get closer!

07:12.599 --> 07:14.533
Patrolman Serpico.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.262
Upstairs.
See the roll-call man.

07:33.686 --> 07:36.587
Memorize your posts and sectors.
This week you're 8:00 to 4:00.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.056
Next week, 4:00 to midnight.
Grab a locker.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.253
Any questions, older guys will
fill you in. Good luck.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.250
Yo! 8:00.
Let's go! Come on!

08:07.320 --> 08:09.845
Gather around. Let's go.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.913
All right. Settle down.

08:14.427 --> 08:18.557
All right. Just a few announcements
today and two new men.

08:18.631 --> 08:22.328
On the board on my left,
you see squad one, blue sector...

08:22.401 --> 08:24.596
squad two, red sector...

08:24.670 --> 08:26.604
squad three, green sector.

08:26.672 --> 08:30.972
Now, we want summonses,
summonses, summonses.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.806
I'll help the boys, Florence.

08:32.878 --> 08:35.142
- This is Frank Serpico, Charlie.
- Hello, Frank.

08:35.214 --> 08:37.409
- Hello, Charlie.
- How about some creamed chicken?

08:37.482 --> 08:40.350
- Sounds good to me.
- No, I think I'll have...

08:40.419 --> 08:43.285
How about a roast beef on roll?

08:46.759 --> 08:50.456
Yeah, okay. You go through
the line. I'll bring it over.

08:53.566 --> 08:56.501
Peluce, it's all fat here.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.763
- I saw real lean beef over there.
- Take it easy.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.276
Sit down, sit down.

09:05.344 --> 09:08.905
- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.848
Well, I'm not fussy.
I don't know how I'm gonna eat this.

09:11.917 --> 09:15.409
Charlie's okay. We give him a break
on double parking on deliveries.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.658
Couldn't I pay for it,
get what I want?

09:24.730 --> 09:27.426
Frank, generally, you just sort of
take what Charlie gives you.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.575
<i>Sector D-David, 1034,
possible rape in progress...</i>

09:39.645 --> 09:44.048
<i>vicinity of PS 218,
Grand Avenue and BQ Expressway.</i>

09:46.852 --> 09:48.786
Becker, aren't
we gonna take that?

09:48.854 --> 09:51.448
Relax, Frank.
It's not our sector.

09:54.126 --> 09:55.718
It's on the borderline.

09:56.595 --> 09:58.495
I'm gonna take it.

09:58.564 --> 10:01.226
D sector, 1547, 10-4.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.463
Oh, my God!

10:38.904 --> 10:41.634
Hold it! Hold it!
Police officers!

10:41.707 --> 10:44.141
Oh, shit!

10:44.210 --> 10:46.440
- Come on. Give us...
- Don't shoot now.

10:46.512 --> 10:48.002
Be cool.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.605
All right. Okay.
Put your guns away.

10:50.683 --> 10:53.015
Put your guns away, man.
Come on. Goddamn it!

10:53.085 --> 10:55.849
I said put them
motherfucking guns away!

10:55.921 --> 10:58.014
I'll cut her, goddamn it.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.320
Turn the motherfucking
light out, man.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.920
I'll cut her, man.
I'll cut her.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.166
Now, you just be cool,
goddamn it.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.328
Just be cool. All right.

11:11.403 --> 11:14.167
All right. All right.
That's it.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.500
The other one took his thing out.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.830
He put it up to my mouth.

11:48.941 --> 11:51.034
He... He held me down.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.841
They said if I didn't do it...

11:56.916 --> 11:58.850
they'd kill me.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.816
She's gonna make
a hell of a witness.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.985
Would you like a stretcher?

12:22.007 --> 12:24.908
Muscles, he's all yours.
I'll call you from the hospital.

13:11.690 --> 13:12.952
Okay, hard-on.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.227
Who were your playmates?

13:21.934 --> 13:24.095
Hey, Frank,
you want a piece of this?

13:24.169 --> 13:26.763
No. I'm gonna fill out
the arrest card.

13:48.427 --> 13:51.988
Hey, Charlie, let me have
five minutes with him.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.998
- Sure.
- Thanks.

13:58.938 --> 14:00.872
Thank you, Charlie.

14:08.881 --> 14:12.282
That prick really worked you over.
How do you feel?

14:12.351 --> 14:14.979
How come you didn't
stay for the fun?

14:15.054 --> 14:17.147
That's not my kind of fun.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.491
Shit.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.156
I want to talk to you.

14:25.230 --> 14:28.757
I want to take you across the
street, get you a cup of coffee...

14:28.834 --> 14:30.461
without cuffs.

14:32.504 --> 14:36.668
Now, look. I didn't touch you
upstairs, right?

14:36.742 --> 14:39.802
You take off on me,
I'll put one in your back.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.311
Understand?

14:43.582 --> 14:45.015
Come on.

14:48.988 --> 14:52.515
<i>It's a goddamn shame you gotta take
this whole rap yourself.</i>

14:55.294 --> 14:57.854
I don't know. Maybe you're guilty,
maybe you're not.

14:59.665 --> 15:02.361
Maybe you just
went along for the ride.

15:02.434 --> 15:04.698
I got a feeling
you just went along.

15:06.939 --> 15:09.237
But you're the one
who got caught.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.640
You never even
got your cock out.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.543
- Put it in the report.
- It's in the report.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.185
Look at you.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.951
- I can't eat.
- No, you can't.

15:28.794 --> 15:31.661
I don't understand you,
you know that?

15:31.730 --> 15:33.823
What are you,
obligated to those guys?

15:33.899 --> 15:36.868
Fuck it.
They left you holding the bag.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.029
You don't owe them nothin'.

15:41.407 --> 15:44.535
They're gonna put you away,
you know that?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.544
What can I get?

15:48.981 --> 15:51.415
Oh, let's see...
kidnapping...

15:51.483 --> 15:53.610
sodomy, rape...

15:54.920 --> 15:56.979
Are you kidding me?

16:03.395 --> 16:06.330
You talk to me.
Save yourself.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.167
Let it go, Harv!

16:22.848 --> 16:24.782
Take the shot.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.045
You not gonna send someone over?
Look, look.

16:27.119 --> 16:29.417
McCoy, I get one,
I'm gonna lose the other.

16:29.488 --> 16:33.652
Look, Serpico, that's Muscles' case.
He's off for a couple days.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.627
<i>- I can't cut in, Frank.
- They're here now!</i>

16:36.695 --> 16:38.629
<i>- It'll keep.
- No, it won't!</i>

17:06.191 --> 17:08.182
Police officer!
Hold it! Hold it!

17:08.260 --> 17:10.626
Turn around. Turn around.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.798
- Ow!
- Spread!

17:15.867 --> 17:19.827
Come on, man. Come on.
Please take that gun from my head.

17:19.905 --> 17:21.839
Turn around slow.

17:35.454 --> 17:38.389
We'll take it from here, kid.
You don't have to hang around.

17:41.193 --> 17:44.321
What are you talking about?
That's my collar.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.256
We take the collar.

17:48.334 --> 17:51.633
A collar like this, don't look good,
a patrolman takes it.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.036
Wait a minute.
I don't care how it looks.

17:54.106 --> 17:58.167
Now, I did the work. I broke my ass
on this. It's my collar.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.576
You really want the collar, kid?
You can be brought up on charges.

18:01.647 --> 18:06.346
Left your post, the street, entered
the school yard without permission...

18:06.418 --> 18:09.410
That's just for openers.
Right, Penella?

18:09.488 --> 18:14.289
No memo entry. Shit. You'll be lucky
to end up with a reprimand.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.954
We'll give you an assist
on the arrest, kid.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.936
Come on, Frankie!

18:25.004 --> 18:28.462
Jim, get out of the way!
What are you doing?

18:30.309 --> 18:33.073
What you want me to do?
Go across the street?

18:50.429 --> 18:53.455
- Hey, Frank.
- Hi, Uncle Will. How you doing?

18:58.103 --> 19:01.595
- Hey, Pasquale.
- Hey, Frankie! How you doing?

19:01.673 --> 19:03.800
Okay. How you doing?
Where's Pop?

19:03.876 --> 19:06.845
Be back in a half hour.
How's it going, Frankie?

19:06.912 --> 19:09.107
Okay.
I come to get my shoes.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.513
Rev it up. Rev it up!

19:13.919 --> 19:16.479
- Here they are.
- Frankie, how you doing?

19:16.555 --> 19:18.489
Okay. Good job.

19:18.557 --> 19:20.491
You people do good work here.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.854
So, how you doing, Frankie?

19:24.930 --> 19:28.195
You keep asking me that. What's
the matter with you? I'm doing okay!

19:28.267 --> 19:32.226
Well, I thought you were coming over
to the house Saturday night.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.397
I'm sorry, Pasquale.
I couldn't make it.

19:34.473 --> 19:38.136
Margaret invited Marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed...

19:38.210 --> 19:42.112
Now, look. I don't like that.
I mean, really.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.878
Don't invite people over
if you're not sure I'm gonna come.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.715
I mean it, now. If I want to
see Marianne, I'll call her.

19:48.787 --> 19:52.018
What's going on
with you two anyway?

19:52.091 --> 19:55.424
Hey, Pasquale,
I'm gonna tell you something.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.993
See, all day long,
I work with cops. Right?

20:00.065 --> 20:02.625
Now, when I go out,
I see Marianne...

20:02.701 --> 20:06.797
her father's a cop, her brother's
a cop, her uncle's a cop.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.898
- I got a feeling she's a cop too.
- Come here!

20:11.176 --> 20:15.374
- How you doing on the job?
- It's got its problems.

20:15.447 --> 20:18.814
Mama tells me that you're looking
for a new apartment. Is that true?

20:18.884 --> 20:21.182
- Yeah.
- So, where are you going?

20:22.488 --> 20:24.854
I don't know.
I'm looking around by school.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.857
NYU? Greenwich Village?

20:26.925 --> 20:29.086
- Yeah, Greenwich Village.
- What's the matter?

20:29.161 --> 20:31.356
The old neighborhood's
not good enough for ya?

20:31.430 --> 20:33.227
Tell Pop I was here.

20:33.298 --> 20:35.163
Frankie, Sunday?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.759
Sunday what?

20:37.836 --> 20:39.963
Dinner? Huh?

20:41.440 --> 20:44.273
- Do me one favor... no Marianne.
- I know. No Marianne.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.436
All right.
A couple of announcements.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.776
"Announcing a course in
fingerprint identification...

20:48.847 --> 20:50.940
to be given at John Jay College.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.109
This course will be available
to those patrolmen...

20:53.185 --> 20:55.278
who wish to make themselves
eligible for assignment...

20:55.354 --> 20:58.551
to the Bureau of
Criminal Identification, BCI...

20:58.624 --> 21:02.025
which is generally considered to be
a path to a detective's gold shield.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.927
Signed, Captain McGuire."

21:04.997 --> 21:07.192
On the board on my left,
you see squad one...

21:10.903 --> 21:12.336
Hot enough for ya?

21:12.404 --> 21:15.134
It's not the heat.
It's the humidity.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.471
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.493
You know how long
you're taking on that one?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.932
Check one print category, two...
That's plenty.

21:46.338 --> 21:49.637
I'm not gonna give a guy a
"no record" when he might have one.

21:50.443 --> 21:53.776
How long you been
with the BCI now, Serpico?

21:53.846 --> 21:56.406
All my life.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.713
That's long enough to know
how we do things.

21:59.785 --> 22:03.221
Barto, it's not just that.

22:03.289 --> 22:06.053
You don't like me.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.685
BCI never had
a weirdo cop before.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.128
Barto, stop buggin' me.

22:22.842 --> 22:23.968
Mama?

24:03.876 --> 24:05.810
Wanna buy a puppy?

24:15.087 --> 24:17.021
Look at that, huh?

24:18.490 --> 24:20.583
Where'd you get these dogs?

24:21.827 --> 24:23.761
Oh, they're mine.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.961
Want one for free?

24:29.034 --> 24:32.526
- I'll pay for it. How much?
- Five dollars.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.207
You got it.

24:40.913 --> 24:44.849
Okay, now which one
of you guys wanna come with me?

24:44.917 --> 24:46.350
What?

24:48.220 --> 24:50.654
Come on.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.554
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?

24:52.625 --> 24:55.651
Just watch the car and my stuff
over here, 'cause I'm movin' in.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.662
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

25:28.594 --> 25:30.186
Don Quixote.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.480
Señorita Land?

25:54.787 --> 25:56.687
Mr. Serpico.

25:56.755 --> 25:59.622
I got my horse here.
Maybe I could drop you someplace.

25:59.692 --> 26:02.354
Well, I'm going to work
at the Café Reggio.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.362
Café Reggio.

26:06.332 --> 26:11.133
- That's 4th Street and...
- MacDougal and 3rd.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.398
- Can I give you a lift?
- Yeah. Sure.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.365
Jesus, what's that?

26:16.442 --> 26:18.842
You got your hands on
my money belt. Don't do that.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.311
That's not a money belt.
That's a gun.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.611
- Well, we gotta eat, don't we?
- Oh, come on!

26:25.684 --> 26:28.983
- What do you need a gun for?
- Ever hear of Barnum and Bailey?

26:29.054 --> 26:30.988
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm their lion tamer.

26:31.056 --> 26:32.956
- Come on.
- That's the truth.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.516
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do, huh?

26:35.594 --> 26:38.028
- What do you do?
- Me?

26:38.097 --> 26:42.363
I'm an actress, a singer,
a dancer and a Buddhist.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.301
In that order?

26:45.371 --> 26:49.740
- I'm a cop. Would you believe that?
- No, I wouldn't believe it.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.933
Those leaps that guy made,
what do you call 'em again?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.592
Jetés.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.908
You try it.

27:23.976 --> 27:27.036
All right. How do you start it?
What's your position?

27:32.251 --> 27:35.277
Next life. Come on.

27:38.724 --> 27:40.817
What are you reading now,
Serpico?

27:44.129 --> 27:46.495
<i>My Life by Isadora Duncan.</i>

27:47.699 --> 27:49.997
She was a ballet dancer.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.366
A belly dancer?

27:52.971 --> 27:56.943
No. No, a ballet dancer.
Ballet.

27:58.110 --> 28:01.170
- You know ballet?
- A little.

28:01.247 --> 28:04.978
- A little bit? You ever see one?
- Not close.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.918
I've been to the ballet.
It's terrific.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.547
- I've been taking classes.
- Oh, yeah?

28:10.623 --> 28:12.557
That's where I go
after I leave here.

28:12.625 --> 28:15.651
Fantastic for your body.
Really builds you up.

28:15.728 --> 28:18.162
- I can tell.
- You noticed, huh?

28:18.230 --> 28:19.356
I noticed.

28:19.432 --> 28:21.024
There's five positions.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.261
Five pos...
You're being shortchanged.

28:23.336 --> 28:26.134
- Oh, no. It's enough. Believe me.
- For what?

28:26.205 --> 28:28.765
Watch. See?

28:28.841 --> 28:30.433
This is the first position.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.773
From this position,
I can do anything.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.676
- You want to see?
- Sure.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.681
Here we go.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.619
Bye, Barto!

28:44.156 --> 28:46.249
- Lieutenant Steiger...
- No, no. Later.

28:51.263 --> 28:55.825
- Hey, turn off the lights.
- Potts, I wanted to read.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.970
Positions, positions!

29:00.072 --> 29:02.097
Positions like that you don't see
in a pretzel factory.

29:02.174 --> 29:05.234
Now I gotta do my pee-pee
in the dark.

29:05.311 --> 29:08.439
She's gotta be a nympho
with positions like that.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.506
Hey, Serpico, how can you piss
at a time like this?

29:11.584 --> 29:13.575
Barto wants a specimen.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.950
I'm gonna look into this matter.

29:20.326 --> 29:23.352
- What do you got there?
- Here.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.021
Straight ahead.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.801
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.370
- I don't see anything over there.
- Let me see.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.808
She just pulled down the shade.

29:39.879 --> 29:42.939
- You gotta be some kind of jinx.
- That's right. Blame me.

29:45.684 --> 29:48.118
Hold it, Serpico.
What were you two doing?

29:49.789 --> 29:52.019
- What?
- In the shithouse in the dark!

29:52.091 --> 29:54.355
Were you goin' down on him?

29:57.630 --> 30:01.066
- What are you talking about?
- You gonna tell me you were peeping?

30:01.133 --> 30:04.068
You were sucking his cock,
weren't you?

30:04.136 --> 30:06.570
- What are you, crazy?
- I'll show you fuckin' crazy!

30:06.639 --> 30:10.268
Last week I found a pair of shorts
with semen on 'em!

30:11.610 --> 30:13.043
There!

30:15.381 --> 30:18.009
You actually accusing me of this?

30:21.554 --> 30:24.352
Good morning, Captain McClain.
I'm Officer Serpico.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.584
I was told I could
talk to you, sir.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.196
Certainly, son.
Come in.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.428
Lieutenant Steiger
won't make a report.

30:38.504 --> 30:42.099
He's too concerned with
the image of his department.

30:42.174 --> 30:45.473
But it... it could affect
your future in the BCI.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.447
Sir, I tell you...

30:51.517 --> 30:53.781
Frankly,
I don't see any future there.

30:53.853 --> 30:58.051
It was bullshit about it being
a path toward being detective...

30:58.124 --> 31:00.285
because I've been there
two years now...

31:00.359 --> 31:02.293
And you want a transfer.

31:03.028 --> 31:06.054
Yes, sir, but I don't wanna
go back to uniform.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.832
I'll see what I can do, Frank.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.639
Francis, do you know about my
weekend retreats for Catholic officers?

31:18.777 --> 31:21.837
Well, you read that.
It might be of interest to you.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.541
You are Catholic?

31:24.617 --> 31:28.144
- Yeah. I was baptized, yes.
- Good, good.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.348
Alfie, come on.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.594
I missed you, baby.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.260
She's so crazy, that girl,
I tell you.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.028
Why Paco?

31:43.102 --> 31:46.128
All my friends call me Paco.
Could you do me a favor?

31:46.205 --> 31:49.538
- Get my keys out of this pocket.
- Sure.

31:50.209 --> 31:53.474
Well, what'll I call you...

31:53.546 --> 31:55.571
Frank or Paco?

32:10.529 --> 32:14.522
Sally! Larry!
This is Paco.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.125
- Hey, man.
- Larry's a poet.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.467
But he works for
an advertising agency.

32:19.538 --> 32:22.098
Sally's an actress,
but works for a photographer.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.471
Paco's a policeman.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.601
That's terrific.

32:25.678 --> 32:27.236
I work for the police department.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.440
- That's really nice.
- Wow.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.707
See ya.

32:33.586 --> 32:35.679
- How are you?
- Pat's a novelist.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.018
But you're working for an insurance
company now, aren't you?

32:38.090 --> 32:40.650
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. Paco's a policeman.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.785
Really? How exciting!

32:42.861 --> 32:46.297
Well, not too.
Right now, I'm filing fingerprints.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.993
Listen,
I file insurance policies.

32:49.702 --> 32:52.102
We should get together then,
file or something.

32:52.171 --> 32:55.163
- That was an improvement.
- I wanna ask you something.

32:55.241 --> 32:59.678
How come all your friends are
on their way to being somebody else?

32:59.745 --> 33:03.044
Think about that. I wanna
ask you something else too.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.174
Will you do me a big favor?

33:05.251 --> 33:07.276
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.288
You know, let me just sort of
do it myself.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.290
Okay.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.567
Hey, man,
are you really a cop?

33:24.036 --> 33:26.368
- Right. I am.
- Wow.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.532
You know,
Leslie is a mind fucker.

33:29.608 --> 33:32.873
You gotta be kidding.
I didn't know that.

33:32.945 --> 33:34.742
What's a mind fucker?

33:34.813 --> 33:36.872
Well, that's a chick...

33:36.949 --> 33:40.282
who digs intellectual types
and super-bright guys.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.445
Oh, yeah?

33:42.521 --> 33:44.785
Well, she's very perceptive.

33:50.896 --> 33:54.093
You know, Japanese culture
and theater and painting...

33:54.166 --> 33:56.134
it's too rigidly stylized.

33:56.201 --> 33:59.728
Well, yeah, you know...
Yeah, but...

34:01.707 --> 34:04.267
I think after a while,
when you get through that...

34:04.343 --> 34:09.178
you start to appreciate the
clarity... you know, the authority.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.876
I got a sheep dog.

34:11.949 --> 34:15.010
There have been
sheep dogs in my family...

34:15.087 --> 34:17.418
dating back...

34:17.489 --> 34:19.217
for 16 generations...

34:20.359 --> 34:23.226
- Dating back to the Borgias.
- Oh, shit!

34:24.330 --> 34:26.992
The family crest...

34:27.065 --> 34:30.399
is a sheep dog
pissing into a gondola.

34:30.469 --> 34:31.902
Oh, shit!

34:39.945 --> 34:41.879
Paco, everybody loves you!

34:41.947 --> 34:44.279
I love you!

34:44.350 --> 34:46.614
Hey, Lieutenant,
my wife call for me?

34:53.058 --> 34:54.992
Give her this, will ya?

34:56.527 --> 34:59.520
Officer Serpico reporting, sir.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.897
That fucking thing on your lip,
it goes. And get a haircut.

35:02.968 --> 35:04.868
- Sir...
- That's an order.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.871
You look like an asshole
with dentures.

35:09.141 --> 35:13.635
- Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
- Sure. Go see Captain Tolkin.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.306
You got one foot in shit already.
Put the other one in.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.646
Where might that be,
I wonder, sir?

35:20.352 --> 35:21.944
Thank you, sir.

35:22.020 --> 35:25.856
That is one hell of a mustache.
I wish I had the guts.

35:28.225 --> 35:31.456
Well, I have what I consider to be
good reasons for wearing it, sir.

35:31.528 --> 35:34.258
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I'd like to tell ya, sir.

35:34.331 --> 35:36.356
I thought so.

35:37.767 --> 35:41.999
I think it's time that we started
to communicate more on the streets.

35:42.072 --> 35:44.870
You know, the way it is,
we're totally isolated, sir.

35:44.941 --> 35:48.001
We're completely out of touch
with what's happening.

35:48.078 --> 35:50.569
An undercover cop walks around
in disguise...

35:50.647 --> 35:52.581
wearing black shoes
and white socks.

35:53.516 --> 35:55.609
Everybody knows who he is.

35:55.685 --> 35:57.915
You made your point.

35:57.988 --> 36:00.320
I want you to keep your mustache.

36:01.024 --> 36:03.925
And I'd like you to patrol
in your own car.

36:03.994 --> 36:06.963
Wear whatever you want.
How does that strike you?

36:07.030 --> 36:08.827
I'd like that, sir.

36:09.733 --> 36:11.963
To be honest,
I'm bucking for detective.

36:12.035 --> 36:13.468
No shit.

37:06.189 --> 37:07.656
Hold it!

37:10.393 --> 37:12.156
What the hell are you doing?

37:14.264 --> 37:16.255
Oh, Christ!

37:17.767 --> 37:19.598
Quick. Get against there.

37:20.637 --> 37:22.070
Hey!

37:22.138 --> 37:24.106
I'm a police officer!
Get over there!

37:24.174 --> 37:26.699
Hey! It's me, Serpico!

37:28.211 --> 37:32.409
Hey, I'm a police officer!
Police officer!

37:32.482 --> 37:34.882
Poli... I'm an officer!
I'm a police officer!

37:34.951 --> 37:37.977
Jesus, Frank, how was I
supposed to recognize you?

37:39.055 --> 37:42.513
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you!

37:42.592 --> 37:46.551
You didn't know me?
You fire without looking?

37:46.629 --> 37:49.996
You fire without a warning,
without a fucking brain in your head?

37:50.967 --> 37:52.901
Oh, shit.

37:54.838 --> 37:57.602
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.

38:05.281 --> 38:06.714
Holy shit.

38:06.783 --> 38:08.910
Look at that mess.

38:13.156 --> 38:15.283
Filling out forms till next month.

38:15.358 --> 38:17.121
Good.

38:17.193 --> 38:19.320
Hey, Jesus, Frank...

38:19.396 --> 38:21.660
I know it's a hell
of a time to ask you...

38:21.731 --> 38:24.222
but I'm gonna have to go through
all that ballistics bullshit...

38:24.300 --> 38:25.562
Good. You should.

38:25.635 --> 38:29.366
It's gonna look like hell if I
don't have anything to show for it.

38:29.439 --> 38:32.772
Frank, do me a favor.
Give us the collar.

38:38.148 --> 38:39.410
You motherfucker.

38:42.752 --> 38:46.848
You want the collar, huh? You
don't wanna fill out forms, right?

39:00.670 --> 39:02.194
Here.

39:03.940 --> 39:06.602
- You're a buddy.
- I'm a buddy.

39:07.877 --> 39:10.641
Only you tell Tolkin
I gave it to you.

39:10.747 --> 39:14.843
I am passing out these marijuana
cigarettes for you to sample...

39:14.918 --> 39:17.785
so that when you become
plainclothesmen...

39:17.854 --> 39:21.722
you'll be able to identify
the pungent aroma...

39:21.791 --> 39:25.318
and recognize the disorienting effect
of the drug...

39:25.395 --> 39:30.162
when you observe them
in narcotics suspects.

39:30.233 --> 39:32.497
Among users of the drug...

39:32.569 --> 39:34.969
a marijuana cigarette...

39:35.038 --> 39:38.201
is referred to as reefer...

39:38.274 --> 39:42.677
stick, roach, joint.

39:42.745 --> 39:46.647
The drug itself
is referred to as pot...

39:46.716 --> 39:48.650
tea, boo...

39:49.786 --> 39:51.811
stuff, grass.

39:53.656 --> 39:55.920
Hey, this is real good shit.

39:56.559 --> 39:59.460
- I gotta have something to eat.
- Oh, look what it is.

39:59.529 --> 40:03.260
Look what it is.
It's a potato factory is what it is.

40:03.333 --> 40:06.496
And I have to have some,
and I love you... I love it.

40:06.569 --> 40:10.733
Have some of that. We have
nothing to... I have to have a dime?

40:10.807 --> 40:13.708
The dime goes
in the little slot there.

40:13.776 --> 40:16.836
That doesn't work.
It's from the Civil War, this machine.

40:16.913 --> 40:19.746
- Pull on it.
- Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't...

40:19.816 --> 40:22.114
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Shoot it out. Please!

40:22.185 --> 40:25.518
I beg of you! Come out!
Potatoes, come out!

40:27.824 --> 40:30.292
You're pretty fuckin' weird
for a cop.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.726
Me? You!

40:32.795 --> 40:35.093
- What about you, buddy? You!
- You're the weird guy. Me?

40:35.165 --> 40:37.565
- You're a fuckin' hippie.
- It's beautiful, though.

40:37.634 --> 40:39.124
The two of us.

40:41.538 --> 40:43.130
Give me.

40:45.074 --> 40:47.167
Where you supposed
to go from here?

40:48.711 --> 40:51.839
93 Precinct, plainclothes.
Put your gun away.

40:53.616 --> 40:55.777
You?

40:55.852 --> 40:58.912
I am scheduled to go
on special assignment...

40:58.988 --> 41:02.480
with the mayor's department
of investigations, detective squad.

41:04.894 --> 41:07.658
- That's gold shield.
- Yeah.

41:07.730 --> 41:10.062
No four years in plainclothes?

41:12.569 --> 41:13.831
Who do you know?

41:13.903 --> 41:17.737
I make it my business to know
people... people who can help.

41:17.807 --> 41:19.240
Unfair.

41:20.310 --> 41:22.574
Unfair.

41:22.645 --> 41:24.943
Life is unfair, pal.

41:25.014 --> 41:28.472
I mean, look, you've got
a feel for the streets, and I...

41:28.551 --> 41:31.076
- I've got a feel for the politics.
- Oh, yeah?

41:31.154 --> 41:35.022
You and me in a Batmobile, we could
clean up the whole city in no time.

41:35.091 --> 41:37.685
I wonder if we can get candy
out of this machine though.

41:44.067 --> 41:45.659
No, thanks.

41:49.572 --> 41:52.905
Well, this is a good place
to tell you, Paco.

41:55.511 --> 41:58.708
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?

42:02.185 --> 42:05.814
- What about him?
- I'm gonna marry him in two months...

42:05.888 --> 42:07.947
unless you marry me.

42:18.167 --> 42:20.863
What about the theater
and your dancing?

42:21.938 --> 42:23.997
A girl has to get
married sometime.

42:25.675 --> 42:28.143
Well, you're a long way
from sometime, Leslie.

42:29.212 --> 42:31.305
I thought you were committed.

42:32.715 --> 42:34.649
I am, but...

42:36.719 --> 42:38.653
You are, but?

42:41.858 --> 42:43.849
I can go on working,
studying there.

42:44.794 --> 42:46.557
Where? Fort Worth?

42:48.231 --> 42:49.255
Amarillo.

42:58.674 --> 43:00.972
Well, am I invited
to the wedding?

43:03.913 --> 43:05.175
I'll ask Roy.

43:10.786 --> 43:13.220
Yeah, it's pretty good
in this precinct.

43:13.289 --> 43:15.223
Here you go.

43:15.291 --> 43:19.193
Usually a 9:00 to 5:00 day is the
best time for policy and bookmaking.

43:20.129 --> 43:23.656
If you have to work nights, like
a liquor violation, just call in.

43:23.733 --> 43:26.099
Don't worry about
quotas right now.

43:26.169 --> 43:29.297
Couple of hooker collars
will keep it cool.

43:40.416 --> 43:42.509
Been holding this for you.

43:42.585 --> 43:45.053
It's from Jewish Max.

44:41.010 --> 44:43.501
First day on the precinct,
I get that.

44:46.282 --> 44:48.216
This is great, Frank.

44:51.020 --> 44:53.113
I can open up a whole can
of peas with this.

44:53.189 --> 44:54.781
It's scary.

44:55.992 --> 44:58.688
I wanna protect myself.

44:58.761 --> 45:00.956
- You know what we do with this?
- What?

45:01.030 --> 45:03.624
We take it to
Inspector Kellogg.

45:08.938 --> 45:12.339
Kellogg... Didn't he used
to be in plainclothes?

45:12.408 --> 45:15.969
He's the second-highest ranking cop
in the department of investigations.

45:16.045 --> 45:18.343
- So what?
- What do you mean, "so what?"

45:18.414 --> 45:20.678
I happened to be instrumental
in getting the man his job.

45:20.750 --> 45:22.843
He owes me.
You understand?

45:24.086 --> 45:26.350
He's the most honest cop
I know, Frank.

45:27.723 --> 45:30.988
Frank, trust me.

45:42.805 --> 45:47.504
Things like this were common
practice in the bad old days.

45:47.576 --> 45:49.840
Hard to believe
it's still going on.

45:53.549 --> 45:56.211
Serpico, don't you think
it's kind of stupid...

45:56.285 --> 45:59.118
taking an envelope from somebody
you didn't know?

46:04.226 --> 46:07.389
What was I supposed to do?
I mean, give me...

46:07.463 --> 46:10.626
How would I know what was in it
unless I took it?

46:10.700 --> 46:13.225
You have two alternatives.

46:13.302 --> 46:16.669
You can force me to take you to
the commissioner of investigations.

46:16.739 --> 46:19.003
He'll drag you in front
of a grand jury.

46:19.075 --> 46:22.533
- I don't want that.
- I can understand that.

46:22.611 --> 46:24.545
Word will get out.

46:24.613 --> 46:28.549
Before it's all over, they'll find
you face-down in the East River.

46:34.190 --> 46:37.591
- What's the other alternative?
- Forget it.

46:39.662 --> 46:41.926
Well, what do I do with this?

47:04.186 --> 47:06.313
Hey, Sarge?
You got a minute?

47:09.825 --> 47:12.794
Colored cop gave me this.
I didn't know what to do with it.

47:19.101 --> 47:21.934
Well, I'll send it on
to the Benevolent Association.

47:33.716 --> 47:35.650
Alfie, come on.

47:57.373 --> 47:59.307
Is that Bjoerling?

48:05.748 --> 48:07.682
No. It's DiStefano.

48:09.885 --> 48:12.479
I was sure it was Bjoerling.

48:19.595 --> 48:22.257
You could hear it
better over here.

48:23.165 --> 48:25.326
- That's an invitation, right?
- Right.

48:26.469 --> 48:27.936
For coffee.

48:29.004 --> 48:32.701
I'll have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.

48:32.775 --> 48:35.903
Why don't you call in sick?
Perfect place.

48:37.713 --> 48:38.907
Not me.

48:38.981 --> 48:41.245
What are you,
dedicated or somethin'?

48:41.317 --> 48:46.016
That's right, I'm dedicated.
Most men can't stand it.

48:46.088 --> 48:49.387
- Well, what do they know?
- I like your garden.

48:55.498 --> 48:56.931
Love my garden.

48:58.267 --> 49:00.963
Okay. I love your garden.

49:02.438 --> 49:04.372
You know what they say,
don't you?

49:05.674 --> 49:07.266
No. What do they say?

49:07.910 --> 49:11.437
If you love a man's garden,
you gotta love the man.

49:17.887 --> 49:19.821
You like her, Alfie?

49:21.357 --> 49:24.019
All I can tell you, sir,
is I gave it back.

49:24.093 --> 49:26.493
I gotta get out of the 93.

49:26.562 --> 49:29.895
Well, what happened on
your narcotics application?

49:29.966 --> 49:33.925
Looked like it was set, until
I told 'em I was in plainclothes.

49:34.003 --> 49:35.800
It was like
the kiss of death.

49:35.872 --> 49:39.137
They think everybody in clothes
is on the take.

49:39.208 --> 49:41.870
Sir, do you know anything about
the Bronx 7th Division?

49:41.944 --> 49:45.903
I can go there if I want,
but if it's the same shit, screw it.

49:45.982 --> 49:49.474
I'd rather answer phones for Spanish
communications unit and go nuts.

49:49.552 --> 49:51.144
Come on, Alfie.

49:52.855 --> 49:55.847
Frank, did anyone
ever tell you...

49:55.925 --> 49:58.519
that you have a tendency
toward self-pity?

50:00.797 --> 50:02.628
No, you're the first.

50:02.698 --> 50:06.225
All right. Frank, I have
a friend up there, Roy Palmer.

50:06.302 --> 50:10.432
He's an administrative officer.
I'll speak with him.

50:10.506 --> 50:12.804
- Good. Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye, Frank.

50:12.875 --> 50:15.036
- God bless you.
- Right.

50:24.053 --> 50:26.681
<i>Frank, Captain McClain here.</i>

50:26.756 --> 50:28.849
Captain McClain. Could you
hold on a minute please, sir?

50:28.925 --> 50:30.358
<i>Sure.</i>

50:36.899 --> 50:39.333
Yeah. Sorry.

50:39.402 --> 50:41.336
I saw Inspector Palmer tonight...

50:41.404 --> 50:44.931
and he assures me the 7th Division
is as clean as a hound's tooth.

50:45.007 --> 50:47.407
His words, Frank.
"Clean as a hound's tooth."

50:48.244 --> 50:51.213
<i>I told him he was getting
a hardworking officer...</i>

50:51.280 --> 50:55.216
wears a beard, speaks Spanish and
would make a superb undercover man.

50:55.284 --> 50:56.546
He was delighted.

50:56.619 --> 51:00.612
That's good news, sir.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

51:00.690 --> 51:02.715
<i>Good-bye, Frank.
God bless.</i>

51:05.328 --> 51:07.922
When did you start doing that?

51:09.732 --> 51:12.030
McClain says that Palmer says...

51:12.101 --> 51:14.501
that the 7th is as clean
as a hound's tooth.

51:15.738 --> 51:18.730
Well, if that's true,
your problems are over.

51:23.946 --> 51:25.880
Plainclothes division.

51:27.717 --> 51:29.150
Upstairs.

51:40.129 --> 51:42.757
- How are you? Good to see you!
- All right.

51:42.832 --> 51:44.891
We heard you were
coming up here. Listen.

51:44.967 --> 51:48.095
Say hello to Nate Smith.
Frank Serpico.

51:48.171 --> 51:51.004
- Jamie Morales, Frank Serpico.
- Serpico?

51:52.074 --> 51:54.440
Hey, babe, you're gonna
love it up here. It's beautiful.

51:54.510 --> 51:56.569
Listen, take...
I'll see youse later, all right?

51:56.646 --> 51:59.012
Take a little ride with me.
Get the feel of the division.

51:59.081 --> 52:01.106
- Maybe I should check in first.
- Fuck that. Come on.

52:02.585 --> 52:06.351
<i>Deck the halls
with boughs of holly</i>

52:10.960 --> 52:14.623
Ten grand, Dallas...
if Minnesota. Right.

52:14.697 --> 52:16.392
Green Bay, 12 and a half at...

52:17.099 --> 52:20.398
You dumb fuck.
We told you this location's hot.

52:20.469 --> 52:22.494
We told you to stay the fuck
out of here.

52:22.572 --> 52:25.336
Keough, nobody told me.
Honest.

52:25.408 --> 52:27.467
Bullshit.

52:27.543 --> 52:29.306
Come on.
Let's take a walk.

52:29.378 --> 52:31.642
Hi, kid.
All right, a C-note apiece.

52:31.714 --> 52:35.775
No way. We got a complaint.
Right, Frank? Come on.

52:35.851 --> 52:38.046
All right.
Make it 200, Keough.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.953
Hey, what, are you getting cheap
in your old age, bambino?

52:41.023 --> 52:43.651
- Three.
- Three?

52:43.726 --> 52:45.387
You heard me.

52:46.462 --> 52:49.659
- All right, three.
- I'll make it a light one.

52:52.935 --> 52:56.598
- You wanna write this up?
- No, I'm gonna check in.

52:56.672 --> 52:58.606
Take the collar, Frank.
Get on the sheet.

52:58.674 --> 53:00.107
I better check in.

53:02.111 --> 53:05.376
We're gonna have
a little talk later, right?

53:08.851 --> 53:11.945
That dumb schmuck only came up with
two bills because I booked him?

53:14.824 --> 53:16.314
Here you go, Frank.

53:16.392 --> 53:18.986
It was your collar.
Keep it.

53:20.429 --> 53:22.954
I had a hunch
you weren't gonna take it.

53:24.133 --> 53:27.500
You know, Frankie, we got a call
about you from downtown.

53:27.570 --> 53:29.197
Now, I ain't sayin' who.

53:29.272 --> 53:31.934
They just said you couldn't
be trusted, you know?

53:33.009 --> 53:35.807
- Because I don't take money, right?
- Come on, Frank.

53:35.878 --> 53:38.369
Let's face it. Who can trust
a cop who don't take money?

53:39.348 --> 53:41.942
I mean, you are pretty weird,
you know, kid?

53:42.018 --> 53:44.782
And with that call, the guys
were gettin' a little worried.

53:44.854 --> 53:47.652
I told them you were okay.
I knew you from the old 21.

53:47.723 --> 53:51.056
You'd never hurt
another cop, right?

53:52.028 --> 53:55.054
You'd never hurt another cop,
would you, Frank?

53:55.131 --> 53:57.929
- That'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frankie.

54:03.773 --> 54:05.502
We're not doing
anything bad here.

54:05.574 --> 54:08.236
We're skimming
a little gambling money.

54:08.311 --> 54:11.337
It's clean. It's not dope.
It hurts nobody.

54:11.414 --> 54:13.348
Come on, Frank.

54:13.416 --> 54:16.715
Gamblers are gentlemen, and
they're gonna operate anyhow, right?

54:16.786 --> 54:19.311
Look, Keough, you don't have to
explain yourself to me.

54:19.388 --> 54:22.516
Do what you got to do.
Want some tea?

54:22.591 --> 54:25.560
No, I don't like that shit.
I'll have a coffee, huh?

54:25.628 --> 54:28.256
What's the matter, Frank?
What are you worried about?

54:28.331 --> 54:31.664
Listen.
We don't go overboard here.

54:31.734 --> 54:33.725
We're not sloppy.
We're careful.

54:33.803 --> 54:37.102
The spicks, niggers, we bust them.
They operate so dumb and sloppy...

54:37.173 --> 54:39.266
they get your ass
in hot water every time.

54:39.342 --> 54:41.867
But the Italians, now,
that's a different story.

54:41.944 --> 54:45.175
They're men of their word.
They're reliable, Frankie.

54:45.247 --> 54:48.546
- You really got it analyzed.
- Fuckin' right I got it analyzed.

54:48.617 --> 54:50.312
It's worth it.

54:51.387 --> 54:53.878
You know how much
the nut's running now, Frankie?

54:55.991 --> 55:00.018
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- $800 a month.

55:00.096 --> 55:04.499
That's 800 clams every time your
girlfriend gets the curse tax free.

55:05.368 --> 55:08.360
Here's the beauty. You don't
get it for the first eight weeks...

55:08.437 --> 55:11.167
till the guys get to
know you and you're okay.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.868
But you don't lose, either, 'cause
you get it on the other end...

55:13.943 --> 55:16.673
when you leave the division.

55:16.746 --> 55:19.772
Frankie, it's like...
it's like severance pay.

55:21.384 --> 55:24.512
Think it over, all right?
In or out.

55:27.323 --> 55:29.883
Look at me. I'm shaking.

55:33.963 --> 55:36.329
All my life I wanted
to be a cop, you know?

55:36.399 --> 55:38.765
It's like I can remember
nothing else.

55:42.405 --> 55:44.430
I remember this one time...

55:45.841 --> 55:47.775
there was...

55:47.843 --> 55:50.368
Somethin' happened.
A domestic argument or somethin'.

55:50.446 --> 55:52.380
Somebody stabbed somebody.

55:53.416 --> 55:55.816
And...

55:55.885 --> 55:58.445
there was this crowd
around this tenement.

55:59.522 --> 56:02.889
I must have been nine,
ten years old. I was this big.

56:02.958 --> 56:04.892
I went over to see
what was going on.

56:04.960 --> 56:08.157
I noticed the red light
goin' around and around...

56:08.230 --> 56:10.664
all these people,
and I couldn't see.

56:11.734 --> 56:15.226
I kept saying, "Do you know
what's goin' on? Do you know?"

56:15.304 --> 56:17.465
Nobody knew.

56:17.540 --> 56:20.737
It was like a big mystery
behind that...

56:20.810 --> 56:22.437
that crowd there.

56:23.512 --> 56:25.946
All of a sudden...

56:26.015 --> 56:28.074
the crowd just parted...

56:28.150 --> 56:30.516
like the Red Sea, you see?

56:30.586 --> 56:34.147
And there were these guys
in blue, and I said...

56:34.223 --> 56:36.054
"They know."

56:37.126 --> 56:40.096
What do they know?
What do they know?

56:45.367 --> 56:47.562
It's amazing.

56:47.636 --> 56:49.604
It's incredible...

56:50.673 --> 56:53.642
but I feel like a criminal
'cause I don't take money.

56:57.713 --> 57:00.238
You get so tense
when you talk about it.

57:00.316 --> 57:01.749
I wonder why.

57:01.817 --> 57:03.409
Come here.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.455
- Right there.
- Here?

57:11.193 --> 57:14.526
I'm gonna ask you
a question, okay?

57:14.597 --> 57:16.895
Do you like cops?

57:16.966 --> 57:18.900
You're my first.

57:20.569 --> 57:23.970
No, I mean all this shit I've been
telling you. Do you believe it?

57:24.039 --> 57:25.631
Why not?

57:27.042 --> 57:29.602
- Does it shock you?
- Not much.

57:30.679 --> 57:33.307
What's the matter with me?

57:33.382 --> 57:35.475
Everybody knows about cops.

57:36.552 --> 57:39.180
Did you ever hear the story
of the wise king?

57:39.255 --> 57:42.418
Nope, but I got the feeling
I'm gonna hear it.

57:43.492 --> 57:47.929
Well, there was this king,
and he ruled over his kingdom.

57:47.997 --> 57:51.398
Right in the middle of the kingdom
there was a well.

57:51.467 --> 57:53.458
That's where everybody drank.

57:53.536 --> 57:57.165
One night,
this witch came along...

57:57.239 --> 57:59.173
and she poisoned the well.

58:00.276 --> 58:03.404
And the next day, everybody drank
from it except the king...

58:03.479 --> 58:05.538
and they all went crazy.

58:05.614 --> 58:07.912
They got together
in the street and they said...

58:07.983 --> 58:10.952
"We got to get rid of the king,
'cause the king is mad."

58:13.289 --> 58:16.520
And then that night, he went down
and he drank from the well.

58:16.592 --> 58:19.390
And the next day
all the people rejoiced...

58:19.461 --> 58:23.557
because their king
had regained his reason.

58:27.303 --> 58:29.237
I think you're trying
to tell me somethin'.

58:29.305 --> 58:31.136
- Me?
- Yeah.

58:33.175 --> 58:35.643
Hey, Frank, I want you
to say hello to somebody.

58:35.711 --> 58:39.647
- Drop your cocks and grab your socks!
- What the fuck is this?

58:41.350 --> 58:44.114
Frank Serpico,
say hello to Don Rubello.

58:44.186 --> 58:46.279
- He's gonna be your new partner.
- How you doin'?

58:47.856 --> 58:51.758
If you don't want to work with this
fucking nut for some reason, man...

58:51.827 --> 58:54.796
I'll buddy up with him,
all right?

58:54.863 --> 58:57.161
And go through all that crap
changing assignments?

58:57.233 --> 58:59.326
No. We'll be okay.

58:59.401 --> 59:01.232
<i>We're paisans, huh?</i>

59:04.173 --> 59:06.300
- What's with the fucking mouse?
- It's my partner.

59:06.375 --> 59:09.139
- Partner?
- He's specially trained, you know?

59:09.211 --> 59:12.339
He goes to track down heroin.

59:12.414 --> 59:15.110
Let him loose, goes into the hole,
picks it up, brings it back...

59:15.184 --> 59:17.618
sniffs it out,
brings it to you.

59:19.355 --> 59:22.085
- Yeah. I heard of that.
- You heard of that?

59:25.961 --> 59:29.089
This guy I'm looking for,
Vernon...

59:29.164 --> 59:32.224
He's a numbers collector who ain't
been meeting his obligations.

59:33.702 --> 59:37.229
He won't be hard to spot.
He's a mover. This is prime time.

59:40.776 --> 59:44.473
Since we're partners,
you gotta know the situation.

59:44.546 --> 59:48.607
Straight off.
I collect for the division...

59:48.684 --> 59:50.777
me and two other bagmen.

59:50.853 --> 59:53.287
That's what Keough
was sort of hinting at.

59:55.524 --> 59:58.254
Three of us pick up
the payoff twice a month.

59:59.928 --> 01:00:01.555
Hey!
Look, there he is.

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:16.509
Son of a bitch!

01:00:20.983 --> 01:00:23.816
- Look out!
- You stupid bastard!

01:01:37.893 --> 01:01:39.326
Where's the money?

01:01:47.736 --> 01:01:49.829
You been jerking me around,
you fuck! Huh?

01:01:49.905 --> 01:01:52.169
Ain't no money!
I'm behind now, man!

01:01:56.445 --> 01:01:58.276
Three times you never show,
right?

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:02.579
I'll have it for you tonight,
I swear.

01:02:02.651 --> 01:02:04.585
Don't bust me!

01:02:06.455 --> 01:02:09.117
Last time, Vernon.
The last time.

01:02:09.191 --> 01:02:13.355
You fuck me and you're gone,
you hear? You hear? Huh?

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.856
See you at the Domino,
midnight.

01:02:16.932 --> 01:02:20.993
And you'd better have $300, ya fuck.
You hear? Right? Right?

01:02:24.039 --> 01:02:25.973
All right, Frank.

01:02:32.214 --> 01:02:34.614
I keep this place
for socializing.

01:02:34.683 --> 01:02:38.119
Someday we'll get a couple of
broads, huh? Have a little party.

01:02:40.689 --> 01:02:42.623
Hey!

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.457
Make some ice.
Booze is right over here.

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:53.663
So what do you think, Frank?
About the money?

01:02:54.503 --> 01:02:56.664
Look, Don...

01:02:56.738 --> 01:03:01.141
if I was broke, if I had a family...
I don't know.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:03.144
But I'm not broke,
and I don't have a family.

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:05.544
So why the fuck stick my neck out?
You know what I mean?

01:03:05.614 --> 01:03:08.674
It's already out, Frank...
not taking the money.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:10.911
It's better the other guys
don't know that.

01:03:10.986 --> 01:03:12.920
Hey, I tell you what I'll do.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.151
I'll hold your share
for you, huh?

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:19.160
You change your mind,
it'll be right in here.

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.628
Right in here,
right down to the penny, huh?

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:23.756
Hey. Look at that.

01:03:23.832 --> 01:03:27.233
- What are you drinking?
- Give me a scotch.

01:03:30.606 --> 01:03:33.541
Next thing I wanna do, I wanna
get a color TV for the games.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:37.010
Hey, how about some gin?
Penny a point. Huh?

01:03:53.929 --> 01:03:56.022
Yeah.
Let me ask him first.

01:04:04.873 --> 01:04:06.807
Hello, Frank.
Get in.

01:04:14.149 --> 01:04:15.350
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.

01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:16.476
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.

01:04:18.553 --> 01:04:20.817
He's a police officer.
I thought maybe he could sit in.

01:04:20.888 --> 01:04:22.913
No, absolutely not.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:24.924
All right, all right.

01:04:28.329 --> 01:04:31.423
I notified Commissioner Delaney
about everything you told me.

01:04:31.499 --> 01:04:35.526
He wants you to stay where you are
and continue to collect information.

01:04:35.603 --> 01:04:38.333
Then you'll be
his eyes and his ears.

01:04:38.406 --> 01:04:40.738
He said he was delighted
that, quote...

01:04:40.808 --> 01:04:44.175
"A man of integrity
had surfaced," unquote.

01:04:46.481 --> 01:04:47.914
When do I hear from him?

01:04:47.982 --> 01:04:51.145
He said he'd reach out for you
when the time comes.

01:04:53.588 --> 01:04:55.021
Reach out?

01:04:57.158 --> 01:04:59.820
See, you know, my situation's
pretty fuckin' sticky up there.

01:04:59.894 --> 01:05:02.124
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Just wait for him...

01:05:02.196 --> 01:05:04.824
- You must have patience, Frank.
- But it's pretty fucking sticky.

01:05:04.899 --> 01:05:06.457
Patience and faith.

01:05:06.534 --> 01:05:09.867
When a man like the commissioner
says he'll get in touch with you...

01:05:09.937 --> 01:05:11.871
he'll get in touch with you.

01:05:13.641 --> 01:05:15.302
Good-bye, son.
God bless you.

01:05:30.324 --> 01:05:32.952
All right, now.
Marinda's too hot.

01:05:33.027 --> 01:05:35.621
We got to lay off him
for a couple of months.

01:05:35.696 --> 01:05:38.290
And listen, Falco's got two runners
he ain't paying for.

01:05:38.366 --> 01:05:41.301
Check that fucking guy out, huh?
Hey, Frankie, how are you?

01:05:41.369 --> 01:05:44.395
- How are you?
- Rubello's being transferred...

01:05:44.472 --> 01:05:46.337
so you're gonna have to work
with a new bagman.

01:05:46.407 --> 01:05:49.968
Al Sarno, I want you to meet Frank
Serpico. This'll be your new man.

01:05:50.044 --> 01:05:51.636
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:05:51.712 --> 01:05:54.738
Listen, you know that operation
down by Hunt's Point, the new one?

01:05:54.816 --> 01:05:56.909
What are we gonna do about that?
Who are we givin' to?

01:05:56.984 --> 01:05:59.544
You the new bagman,
you prick?

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.989
What happened to Rubello, you son
of a bitch? You narco cop fucker!

01:06:04.058 --> 01:06:05.992
Wait a minute.

01:06:17.605 --> 01:06:20.665
You know, Frank,
sometimes I ask myself...

01:06:20.741 --> 01:06:22.936
what the fuck am I doing?

01:06:24.946 --> 01:06:27.608
You know,
if this ever came out...

01:06:27.682 --> 01:06:29.616
Christ, my family.

01:06:31.352 --> 01:06:32.614
My daughter.

01:06:34.155 --> 01:06:36.385
She just started
with the San Francisco Opera.

01:06:36.457 --> 01:06:37.822
Chorus.

01:06:38.893 --> 01:06:40.952
Took a lot of money.

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:44.998
I once tried to pull out.

01:06:45.066 --> 01:06:47.227
Christ, they were all over me.

01:06:47.301 --> 01:06:49.360
So you...

01:06:49.437 --> 01:06:51.371
just go along.

01:06:55.209 --> 01:06:57.734
Unless you're willing
to go back to uniform duty.

01:07:15.763 --> 01:07:17.993
Shit.
How the money rolls in.

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:22.791
- Here. Let me give you yours now.
- I'm not on.

01:07:23.771 --> 01:07:26.103
- What do you mean, you're not on?
- Just what I said.

01:07:26.173 --> 01:07:28.767
I'm not on.
I don't take money.

01:07:28.843 --> 01:07:31.334
- Some gag. Here.
- No, I told you straight.

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.940
I don't take money,
and that's the truth.

01:07:37.018 --> 01:07:39.987
- What were you doing with Rubello?
- Ask Rubello.

01:07:43.691 --> 01:07:46.182
Your nut...
where's it been going?

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.784
Ask Rubello.

01:07:50.398 --> 01:07:52.525
<i>All right, then, sir.
I'll go to Delaney myself then.</i>

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.195
- That would not be advisable.
- You don't understand, Captain.

01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:59.933
<i>- It's been weeks. Not a word.
- I understand perfectly.</i>

01:08:00.007 --> 01:08:02.498
No, but, Captain,
now they know I'm not on.

01:08:02.577 --> 01:08:04.841
I've done all I can do.
Good-bye, Frank.

01:08:10.284 --> 01:08:13.412
He's out.
Won't do another fucking thing.

01:08:14.956 --> 01:08:17.652
Blair, I'm telling you, nothing's
gonna happen from the inside.

01:08:17.725 --> 01:08:20.057
The top guys have been
cops too long.

01:08:22.095 --> 01:08:24.029
You haven't heard from
Commissioner Delaney, have you?

01:08:24.098 --> 01:08:25.759
No, not a fucking word.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.571
Would you be willing to go
outside the department?

01:08:35.576 --> 01:08:37.372
Where could we go?

01:08:38.645 --> 01:08:40.876
Would you believe
the mayor's office?

01:08:49.357 --> 01:08:51.551
- The mayor's office?
- His right-hand man...

01:08:51.626 --> 01:08:54.356
guy named Jerry Berman,
from Princeton.

01:08:54.428 --> 01:08:57.124
You knew I knew somebody.
That's the somebody I know.

01:08:57.198 --> 01:08:59.223
And he cares, Frank.
He really cares.

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:05.968
- You know what we're doing?
- Yeah.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.907
- We're going outside the department.
- That's right.

01:09:12.947 --> 01:09:14.140
<i>Dynamite.</i>

01:09:14.215 --> 01:09:17.343
Every plainclothesman
in the division...

01:09:17.417 --> 01:09:19.750
and one,
maybe two lieutenants?

01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:23.846
That is dynamite.
That is incredible.

01:09:23.924 --> 01:09:27.121
That is 150...

01:09:27.194 --> 01:09:30.254
That is $250,000 a year...

01:09:30.331 --> 01:09:33.357
but that is just one precinct.

01:09:33.434 --> 01:09:36.095
Oh, that is amazing!

01:09:37.104 --> 01:09:40.733
See, what I feel is needed here
is, like, a real investigation.

01:09:40.808 --> 01:09:43.935
And I am sure that the mayor
will see this immediately.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:46.872
McClain and Delaney...

01:09:46.947 --> 01:09:49.381
they have done nothing?

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:51.212
Oh, man.
That is amazing.

01:09:54.355 --> 01:09:57.620
Another thing.
See, in a couple of days...

01:09:57.692 --> 01:09:59.284
they're gonna have
a meeting of the pad.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.622
Oh, right.

01:10:00.695 --> 01:10:03.562
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that.

01:10:03.631 --> 01:10:07.897
Rumors. See, I have heard rumors,
but never touching it directly.

01:10:07.968 --> 01:10:13.429
And for an on-the-line cop to come
forward like this is beautiful.

01:10:13.507 --> 01:10:15.737
Really, Frank, I mean...

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:18.677
you have my respect
and my sympathy...

01:10:18.746 --> 01:10:20.680
for what you've been
going through, man.

01:10:20.748 --> 01:10:22.511
Wow.

01:10:27.288 --> 01:10:29.620
Hello.
This is Jerry Berman.

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:32.420
Is he there?
All right. I'll hold on.

01:10:49.477 --> 01:10:50.910
Well?

01:10:52.613 --> 01:10:54.706
Tell me what happened,
Paco.

01:10:54.782 --> 01:10:56.716
I'd like a drink.

01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:04.453
That guy is gonna
go to the mayor.

01:11:09.663 --> 01:11:11.597
To the mayor!

01:11:14.135 --> 01:11:16.501
Come here, Alfie. We're all
gonna go to the mayor together.

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:18.504
You know that?

01:11:22.076 --> 01:11:24.408
I couldn't be
any more embarrassed.

01:11:26.114 --> 01:11:28.173
It's like a personal defeat.

01:11:29.884 --> 01:11:31.852
However...

01:11:31.919 --> 01:11:33.853
there are priorities.

01:11:33.921 --> 01:11:36.355
What are the priorities,
Jerry?

01:11:36.424 --> 01:11:38.517
The priorities are...

01:11:38.593 --> 01:11:41.027
a long, hot summer ahead...

01:11:41.095 --> 01:11:43.825
and riots are expected...

01:11:45.066 --> 01:11:49.093
and the mayor cannot
alienate the police force.

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:51.968
Now, in the fall...

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.907
Now, in the fall,
it may be possible...

01:11:54.976 --> 01:11:56.910
to take another look
at the situation.

01:11:56.978 --> 01:11:58.775
All right, fine.
I'm sorry.

01:12:12.627 --> 01:12:14.595
They're all rotten.

01:12:14.662 --> 01:12:16.755
Chickenshit.

01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:18.890
The whole fucking
system's corrupt.

01:12:23.404 --> 01:12:25.964
- Who's there?
- It's me. I gotta talk to ya.

01:12:29.277 --> 01:12:33.543
You know, Frank, you're behaving
like a goddamn child. You hear?

01:12:33.614 --> 01:12:35.548
Let him in.

01:12:37.285 --> 01:12:39.219
You let him in.

01:12:57.472 --> 01:13:00.635
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.

01:13:00.708 --> 01:13:03.802
Bullshit! I got me
into this whole thing.

01:13:05.179 --> 01:13:07.511
"Wow. Amazing!

01:13:07.582 --> 01:13:11.450
"Dynamite!
Beautiful! Dynamite!

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:13.453
Priorities. Priorities."

01:13:13.521 --> 01:13:16.456
You and your big-deal friends,
your contacts...

01:13:16.524 --> 01:13:18.822
your big bullshit names.

01:13:18.893 --> 01:13:21.657
Bob Blair, the big operator
from Princeton.

01:13:21.729 --> 01:13:24.698
The mystery man with the connections,
the hot line to the mayor.

01:13:24.766 --> 01:13:26.927
Who the fuck do you think you are,
you son of a bitch?

01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:29.765
You come looking for help,
whining, mealy-mouthed...

01:13:29.837 --> 01:13:31.998
with your humble-pie act...
the saint, the injured innocent.

01:13:32.073 --> 01:13:34.007
Who told you the department
or the whole world...

01:13:34.075 --> 01:13:36.635
was some kind
of a fucking boy scout camp?

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:43.009
What do you expect, for Christ's
sake, a magician? A big daddy?

01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:46.520
White knight snaps his fingers,
the dirty world turns white...

01:13:46.587 --> 01:13:48.521
Just keep talking.
That's what you can do.

01:13:48.589 --> 01:13:51.057
while the Pope's choir sings
"Ave Maria," is that it?

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:54.288
You gonna blame me 'cause those
bastards don't wanna get involved?

01:13:55.363 --> 01:13:57.160
I tried to help you.
I got my head handed to me.

01:13:57.231 --> 01:13:59.961
Where's your head? It's on
your shoulders. That's what I see.

01:14:00.034 --> 01:14:03.299
- You don't look so hot yourself.
- What's all this shit over here?

01:14:03.371 --> 01:14:05.566
Get ready to blow up again,
'cause I got another idea.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.234
You and your ideas
are as full of shit as you are.

01:14:08.309 --> 01:14:10.800
- Right on cue.
- Right on cue.

01:14:10.878 --> 01:14:12.539
We can talk to Foreman,
the commissioner of investigations.

01:14:12.613 --> 01:14:15.241
Another guy!
We got another guy here.

01:14:15.316 --> 01:14:17.750
<i>We could even talk to a guy
I know on the New York Times.</i>

01:14:18.986 --> 01:14:22.649
<i>Oh, that's terrific.
Go to the Times.</i>

01:14:22.723 --> 01:14:25.954
Every time I talk to you, Blair,
20 more people know about it.

01:14:26.027 --> 01:14:27.460
This is safe, Frank.

01:14:27.528 --> 01:14:29.359
It's safe? With my ass on the line,
it's safe, right?

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:33.059
- Your ass is already on the line!
- That's my business!

01:14:33.134 --> 01:14:35.193
- You don't trust me, Frank?
- I don't trust you!

01:14:35.269 --> 01:14:36.827
- Go fuck yourself!
- Fuck you!

01:14:41.676 --> 01:14:43.610
Look, when I come home,
I want a house clean.

01:14:43.678 --> 01:14:47.205
- Don't take it out on me, Paco.
- I don't want to pick up shit!

01:15:28.122 --> 01:15:30.113
Honey...

01:15:30.191 --> 01:15:32.284
come to bed.

01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:43.221
All right. Look, we all know
what this is about, right?

01:16:43.297 --> 01:16:47.199
Frank, what the hell was happening
between you and Don Rubello?

01:16:50.204 --> 01:16:54.072
Simple. I didn't take any money.
I don't take money.

01:16:54.141 --> 01:16:58.942
Rubello said if I changed my mind,
he'd hold my share...

01:16:59.013 --> 01:17:01.573
he'd give it back to me.

01:17:01.649 --> 01:17:04.209
- I didn't change my mind.
- The conniving bastard.

01:17:04.285 --> 01:17:08.016
- All right. I'll handle Rubello.
- Donny was stealing.

01:17:08.088 --> 01:17:11.819
I'll get back the money he took.
But this ain't gonna happen again.

01:17:11.892 --> 01:17:15.623
From now on, no more three bagmen.
Starting today, every one of you...

01:17:15.696 --> 01:17:20.429
makes his own collections...
no stops, no bread, okay?

01:17:20.501 --> 01:17:22.435
- Right.
- You got it.

01:17:22.503 --> 01:17:26.633
What about you, Frankie?
I'll make up what Don took from you.

01:17:26.707 --> 01:17:31.337
- Why should I start now?
- Everybody'd feel better about you.

01:17:31.412 --> 01:17:33.107
You can always give it
to charity.

01:17:34.748 --> 01:17:37.717
Look, Frankie, what do you say,
a hundred a month just for expenses?

01:17:38.752 --> 01:17:42.347
For my secretary and my
business lunches, entertainment?

01:17:45.826 --> 01:17:50.388
All right. All right.
We split Frank's share from now on.

01:17:50.464 --> 01:17:52.432
You're a schmuck, Frank.

01:18:00.441 --> 01:18:02.909
If they would take
all that energy, see...

01:18:02.977 --> 01:18:05.070
put it into
straight police work...

01:18:05.145 --> 01:18:06.544
we'd have the city
cleaned up in a week.

01:18:06.614 --> 01:18:09.048
They'd clean up.
There'd be no crime.

01:18:15.856 --> 01:18:18.723
If I could work alone...
That's the thing, see?

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:21.454
If I could just get... Work alone.
But they don't like that.

01:18:21.529 --> 01:18:23.622
They don't want that.
They want to suck you in.

01:18:23.697 --> 01:18:26.495
You go over
the same thing, Paco.

01:18:26.567 --> 01:18:30.765
So fucking corrupt. Everybody,
everyone. Nobody giving a shit!

01:18:30.838 --> 01:18:34.001
There's gotta be a way
to wipe it out, goddamn it.

01:18:34.074 --> 01:18:36.736
Let's get out of here for a while,
huh, honey? Let's go to a movie.

01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:40.268
Quit handling me! What are you
doing? How am I gonna go to a movie?

01:18:40.347 --> 01:18:43.839
They'd kill me if they knew!
You think that hasn't happened?

01:18:43.918 --> 01:18:47.752
Either you're exploding, or you're
lying around like a catatonic!

01:18:47.821 --> 01:18:51.279
- I can't stand it, Paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?

01:18:51.358 --> 01:18:54.657
All I care about is you!
That's all that matters to me.

01:18:54.728 --> 01:18:58.323
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this...

01:18:58.399 --> 01:19:01.800
Scared, miserable,
dreading to go to work.

01:19:01.869 --> 01:19:03.803
It's tearing me apart!

01:19:03.871 --> 01:19:07.432
And then I get sick of hearing
about it, and I start hating myself.

01:19:07.508 --> 01:19:11.342
You didn't like my being a cop,
so don't give me that shit.

01:19:11.412 --> 01:19:16.816
I love you! I want to marry you!
I want to have children with you!

01:19:16.884 --> 01:19:20.718
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- Why don't you get out?

01:19:20.788 --> 01:19:24.781
- Why don't you?
- It's crossed my mind.

01:19:24.858 --> 01:19:27.520
Well, do it.

01:19:40.774 --> 01:19:44.301
- What do you got?
- Would you bust whitey?

01:19:44.378 --> 01:19:46.312
Try me. Try me.

01:19:47.314 --> 01:19:50.340
This guy's heavy.
He's Italian.

01:19:50.417 --> 01:19:54.114
Mobbed up.
Still interested?

01:19:54.188 --> 01:19:57.021
Stop fuckin' around.
I'm not in the mood. Come on.

01:19:57.091 --> 01:20:01.653
He's a loan shark,
runs a big numbers operation.

01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:04.254
This mother's so cocksure...

01:20:04.331 --> 01:20:07.596
he picks up his own slips
while he's collecting his loans.

01:20:07.668 --> 01:20:09.101
Where's the drop?

01:20:56.517 --> 01:20:57.779
Hold it!

01:20:57.851 --> 01:21:00.513
I'm a police officer.

01:21:00.587 --> 01:21:01.952
And...

01:21:04.324 --> 01:21:07.122
Wait a minute.
You're under arrest.

01:21:08.562 --> 01:21:11.497
- I thought you were a junkie.
- I'll take that wad in your pocket.

01:21:13.701 --> 01:21:15.464
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know. I'm a joke.

01:21:15.536 --> 01:21:17.766
What are you doin'?
What's that?

01:21:19.239 --> 01:21:22.231
Put that away, or you're in more
trouble. Give me your car keys.

01:21:28.048 --> 01:21:30.209
Where they been
hiding you, kid?

01:21:30.284 --> 01:21:32.377
Wouldn't you like to know?

01:21:34.655 --> 01:21:37.249
Hold this guy for booking.
Get a rap sheet on him.

01:21:37.324 --> 01:21:39.258
I'm gonna search his car.

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:04.141
Where's Corsaro?

01:22:04.218 --> 01:22:06.152
Smith took him upstairs.

01:22:16.063 --> 01:22:18.554
I swear to God, I thought this guy
was some fucking junkie.

01:22:21.068 --> 01:22:23.332
Listen, Rudy, you should
see some of the...

01:22:34.281 --> 01:22:36.617
- Hey, you.
- Hey, who?

01:22:37.517 --> 01:22:40.816
You. Get over here
and empty your pockets.

01:22:40.887 --> 01:22:44.152
- I don't do that.
- You're my prisoner. Do what I say.

01:22:44.224 --> 01:22:46.692
- Get over here.
- He's gonna get nasty about it.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.524
You're fucking right!

01:22:49.596 --> 01:22:52.292
Hey, Frank, cool it, huh?

01:22:52.366 --> 01:22:54.994
Lean, motherfuck!
Spread!

01:22:55.068 --> 01:22:57.400
Frank. Hey, Frank, Rudy's on.
He's good people.

01:22:57.471 --> 01:23:00.031
Stay the fuck outta this!

01:23:01.141 --> 01:23:03.075
You fuck!

01:23:04.378 --> 01:23:06.505
What's this?
What's this?

01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:08.514
Get in! Get in!

01:23:57.664 --> 01:24:01.361
Serpico.
Got that record check on Corsaro.

01:24:16.183 --> 01:24:18.276
You want to read something?

01:24:20.253 --> 01:24:22.619
It's about your pal Corsaro.

01:24:22.689 --> 01:24:25.487
Here, read it.
Read it!

01:24:28.562 --> 01:24:31.087
He did 15 years.
You know what for?

01:24:31.164 --> 01:24:34.292
For killing a cop.
He's a fucking cop killer.

01:24:45.946 --> 01:24:48.107
- It's good to see you again.
- I've had it. I'm finished.

01:24:48.181 --> 01:24:50.809
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it. I gotta get out.

01:24:50.884 --> 01:24:53.409
If I have to go back to uniform,
I'm going back to uniform.

01:24:53.487 --> 01:24:57.082
I can't wait for Delaney to call.
I can't play their game anymore.

01:24:57.157 --> 01:25:00.092
The commissioner didn't
get in touch with you?

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:03.095
Not a word. No investigation,
no undercover work, nothing!

01:25:03.163 --> 01:25:07.361
- I had no idea, Frank.
- It's only fair to tell you.

01:25:07.434 --> 01:25:09.902
I've been to outside agencies.
I'll go to more if I have to.

01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:12.165
What outside agencies?

01:25:12.239 --> 01:25:16.471
Holy Mother of God! Frank, we wash
our own laundry around here!

01:25:16.543 --> 01:25:21.242
- You could be brought up on charges!
- We do not wash our own laundry!

01:25:21.314 --> 01:25:22.747
- It just gets dirtier!
- You are in trouble!

01:25:22.816 --> 01:25:25.944
I don't care if I'm in trouble.
I don't care who gets it.

01:25:26.019 --> 01:25:29.750
- If I have to go to outside agencies...
- Stay away from outside agencies!

01:25:29.823 --> 01:25:31.791
- Where am I gonna go?
- You hear me?

01:25:31.858 --> 01:25:34.088
- Where am I gonna go?
- Wait until you hear from me.

01:25:34.161 --> 01:25:36.061
- I've been waiting for 11/2 years.
- I'll get back to you.

01:25:36.129 --> 01:25:39.394
That's not enough!
Where am I gonna go?

01:25:42.035 --> 01:25:44.503
It's my life, you fuck!

01:25:46.039 --> 01:25:49.372
Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.

01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:59.284
For this precinct,
cases reported...

01:25:59.352 --> 01:26:04.949
Murder... 14 for August,
20 for September, 23...

01:26:07.861 --> 01:26:09.294
Inspector Palmer?

01:26:12.032 --> 01:26:15.001
Deputy Chief Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

01:26:15.068 --> 01:26:17.161
are waiting to see you.

01:26:20.574 --> 01:26:22.838
You want to come
to my office?

01:26:28.982 --> 01:26:31.382
Captain McClain called me.

01:26:31.451 --> 01:26:33.544
I briefed Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert...

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:36.088
on your allegations.

01:26:36.156 --> 01:26:40.718
The question is, in all these
months, why didn't you come to us?

01:26:43.263 --> 01:26:44.696
Well...

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.799
I never met these gentlemen
before, sir, and...

01:26:50.871 --> 01:26:53.305
you told...

01:26:53.373 --> 01:26:55.967
I mean,
you told Captain McClain...

01:26:56.042 --> 01:26:58.476
that the division was as clean
as a hound's tooth.

01:26:58.545 --> 01:27:02.276
You think you're the only honest cop
on the force, Serpico?

01:27:02.349 --> 01:27:04.442
My record's clear.

01:27:04.517 --> 01:27:06.644
Inspector Gilbert's just
come from the commissioner's...

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.654
confidential
investigation unit.

01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:12.586
Then you must have
heard something. I mean...

01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:16.394
I don't understand.

01:27:16.463 --> 01:27:19.091
Commissioner Delaney has known
about this from the beginning.

01:27:21.534 --> 01:27:23.968
No, I didn't hear a thing.

01:27:24.037 --> 01:27:27.234
But I understand
your frustration, Frank...

01:27:27.307 --> 01:27:29.400
believe me.

01:27:29.476 --> 01:27:32.604
I mean, it's sort of like
trying to punch your way...

01:27:32.679 --> 01:27:34.772
out of a paper bag,
right?

01:27:38.118 --> 01:27:40.518
What outside agencies
have you been to, Frank?

01:27:48.495 --> 01:27:50.963
I don't see how that's pertinent
to my allegations.

01:27:52.565 --> 01:27:55.830
We ought to ask Serpico directly
if he's gonna cooperate or not.

01:27:55.902 --> 01:27:57.836
- Come on.
- We've gotta know...

01:27:57.904 --> 01:28:00.395
if there's any real basis
for an investigation.

01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:05.244
Well, I...

01:28:05.312 --> 01:28:07.405
I'll have to think that...

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.971
I'm gonna have to think
about that.

01:28:10.050 --> 01:28:13.213
What is there
to think about?

01:28:13.286 --> 01:28:15.982
I don't see how the division
can investigate itself, sir.

01:28:18.124 --> 01:28:21.025
You've got a point there.

01:28:21.094 --> 01:28:24.928
But you would cooperate with
an impartial investigation, right?

01:28:27.801 --> 01:28:32.568
Yeah. Up to a point.
As long as I'm not involved.

01:28:34.074 --> 01:28:37.737
I just want to go someplace
where I can do my job.

01:28:37.811 --> 01:28:40.371
That's fair enough.

01:28:40.447 --> 01:28:42.381
We'll be in touch.

01:28:46.553 --> 01:28:48.487
Inspector Palmer?

01:28:48.555 --> 01:28:50.648
May I see you a minute?

01:28:56.029 --> 01:28:58.122
Was it necessary to let everyone
in the station house...

01:28:58.198 --> 01:29:00.962
know I was comin' in here
to see these guys?

01:29:01.034 --> 01:29:03.366
You believe from what you now know
that a full-scale investigation...

01:29:03.436 --> 01:29:04.835
is warranted?

01:29:05.905 --> 01:29:08.567
- Yes, Commissioner Delaney.
- Go to it.

01:29:12.879 --> 01:29:15.040
But, sir...

01:29:15.115 --> 01:29:17.640
shouldn't headquarters
handle something like this?

01:29:18.551 --> 01:29:22.487
No.
You're all experienced men.

01:29:24.557 --> 01:29:26.957
Chief Gallagher here will be
available for consultation.

01:29:32.966 --> 01:29:34.399
Commissioner...

01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:40.801
Serpico claims that...

01:29:40.874 --> 01:29:44.139
McClain talked to you about
this whole thing some time ago.

01:29:44.210 --> 01:29:47.915
Yes. I seem to remember
something about that.

01:29:52.586 --> 01:29:57.216
We can't set up a surveillance on
"somewhere over by Crotona Park."

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:59.282
We need a location!

01:29:59.359 --> 01:30:02.226
I've given you 36 locations
that are paying off.

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:05.959
Now, what do you want? The whole
thing signed, sealed, delivered?

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:08.866
You're conducting this
investigation, not me.

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:10.995
Lieutenant Smith...
Let's get back to him.

01:30:11.071 --> 01:30:15.440
Lieutenant Smith.
Lieutenant Smith said to me...

01:30:15.509 --> 01:30:19.309
if I didn't want the money that
he would stash it in his attic.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.479
I'll have him transferred
in the morning.

01:30:21.548 --> 01:30:24.346
Fuck him.
How about transferring me?

01:30:36.930 --> 01:30:38.921
I hear you been
vouchering pad money...

01:30:38.999 --> 01:30:42.799
over to a confidential
investigation squad.

01:30:42.869 --> 01:30:47.363
Oh, yeah? How can I voucher money
when I don't take any?

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:49.375
You won't find anything
on Serpico.

01:30:52.279 --> 01:30:54.440
He's clean.

01:30:54.514 --> 01:30:55.947
Right?

01:30:59.152 --> 01:31:01.017
You practicing your frisk?

01:31:04.491 --> 01:31:07.085
I'm looking to buy
a used tape recorder.

01:31:10.297 --> 01:31:13.960
They're feeling me up every day.
How am I gonna wear a wire?

01:31:14.034 --> 01:31:15.467
Come on, Frank.

01:31:15.535 --> 01:31:20.563
Wearing a wire means testifying to
corroborate the tape, right? Right.

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.632
I'm not testifying.

01:31:23.710 --> 01:31:25.871
I gotta put a dime
in the parking meter.

01:31:25.946 --> 01:31:29.438
Ragland, put a dime
in the parking meter for Serpico.

01:31:34.421 --> 01:31:39.358
Hey, Frank. Frank, you know
Herman Tauber, district attorney?

01:31:39.426 --> 01:31:40.859
Yeah, I watch television.

01:31:40.927 --> 01:31:45.330
Frank, I want to compliment you
for coming forward like this.

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:47.333
It's unique.

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:51.428
It's uniquely unique.
You should be proud of yourself.

01:31:51.505 --> 01:31:54.531
There's gonna be a grand jury
on these shitheels...

01:31:54.608 --> 01:31:57.839
with Frank Serpico
as my star witness.

01:31:57.911 --> 01:32:01.472
Mr. Tauber, you and everybody
in this room can go to hell...

01:32:01.548 --> 01:32:02.981
'cause I'm not testifying.

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:06.144
- Listen...
- Wait just a second, Frank.

01:32:06.219 --> 01:32:08.551
You have nothing to fear.
You're not gonna be singled out.

01:32:08.622 --> 01:32:10.988
I'm not afraid.
I don't give a fuck who knows...

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:12.821
- Wait a minute...
- if it meant something...

01:32:12.893 --> 01:32:15.259
- but this investigation is bullshit.
- Mind if I say something?

01:32:15.328 --> 01:32:18.058
Bullshit. You're not going after
corruption in the department...

01:32:18.131 --> 01:32:19.860
the division, the Bronx.

01:32:19.933 --> 01:32:21.867
A few flunky cops
thrown to the wolves...

01:32:21.935 --> 01:32:24.995
to protect Delaney and those guys
who've known about this for years...

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:27.939
and won't do a fuckin' thing about
it, that's why I won't testify.

01:33:02.309 --> 01:33:06.575
- Hey, what's this?
- Exactly what it says.

01:33:06.646 --> 01:33:08.238
I'm splitting.

01:33:08.315 --> 01:33:10.408
"Splitting." I never read
anything so stupid in my life.

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:13.817
"I'm leaving. If you want to
discuss it, I'll be at Felix's."

01:33:13.887 --> 01:33:16.082
I didn't feel like another
blood-and-guts scene.

01:33:16.156 --> 01:33:18.124
I figured you wouldn't
be able to shout in here.

01:33:18.191 --> 01:33:20.250
I can shout anywhere!

01:33:25.398 --> 01:33:27.332
I won't shout.

01:33:28.969 --> 01:33:30.527
Sit down, sit down.

01:33:43.817 --> 01:33:45.910
It's just gonna go on
and on, Paco.

01:33:45.986 --> 01:33:48.079
It isn't gonna
get any better.

01:33:49.723 --> 01:33:52.487
And if you quit,
somehow I'll be blamed.

01:34:01.668 --> 01:34:03.795
How could you leave
the man you love...

01:34:04.871 --> 01:34:06.964
future father of your kids?

01:34:09.809 --> 01:34:12.437
You never said anything
like that to me before.

01:34:14.114 --> 01:34:17.845
And if I come back,
you won't say it again.

01:34:20.153 --> 01:34:23.645
You want to be free
and unattached...

01:34:23.723 --> 01:34:27.181
to go on fighting for your cause
and keep torturing yourself.

01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:28.693
My cause.

01:34:33.833 --> 01:34:35.425
I felt so safe with you...

01:34:36.803 --> 01:34:38.794
so loving.

01:34:48.481 --> 01:34:49.914
Stay with me, Laurie.

01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.154
- Come on. Stay with me.
- No, no.

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:10.425
- What do I owe you for that?
- Excuse me.

01:35:10.503 --> 01:35:12.437
Here.

01:35:12.505 --> 01:35:13.938
Here's $2.00.

01:35:31.391 --> 01:35:33.325
What are you doing?

01:35:37.897 --> 01:35:39.364
Do you want to walk away,
or should I?

01:35:41.201 --> 01:35:42.634
I'm not gonna walk away.

01:35:44.838 --> 01:35:46.100
It's finished!

01:35:54.114 --> 01:35:57.515
Who do you think you are, trying to
pull that "no testifying" bullshit on me?

01:35:57.584 --> 01:36:01.350
Chief Green,
I know your reputation.

01:36:01.421 --> 01:36:05.721
Look, maybe if you were borough
commander when this thing started...

01:36:05.792 --> 01:36:09.193
run this investigation yourself,
I'd feel different about testifying.

01:36:09.262 --> 01:36:11.594
But the truth is,
you're coming in after the fact.

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:15.999
You're like a quiff who says
she won't, then maybe she will.

01:36:16.069 --> 01:36:18.663
I'm like a quiff
who's been fucked over...

01:36:18.738 --> 01:36:22.697
for a year and a half by guys like
Kellogg, McClain, Delaney...

01:36:22.776 --> 01:36:25.677
I'm not Kellogg,
McClain or Delaney!

01:36:25.745 --> 01:36:28.578
Frank, it won't be
just flunky cops.

01:36:28.648 --> 01:36:31.344
This is only the beginning.
This could be the biggest thing...

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:34.581
- since the Harry Gross case.
- And meanwhile, where am I?

01:36:34.654 --> 01:36:37.145
I'm out there alone.
Who gives a fuck about that?

01:36:37.223 --> 01:36:39.987
I'm totally isolated in the
department. I don't have a friend.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:43.552
Don't give me that bullshit. I've
been puttin' cops away for 30 years!

01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:47.088
My name's an obscenity on every
precinct shithouse wall in the city.

01:36:47.167 --> 01:36:51.001
- I've observed that, sir.
- Friends! I fought my way up...

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:52.766
as a Jew in the department in the
days you were supposed to have...

01:36:52.839 --> 01:36:55.535
an uncircumcised shamrock
between your legs.

01:36:55.608 --> 01:36:57.473
I have this nightmare
I'm on 5th Avenue...

01:36:57.544 --> 01:37:00.104
watching the St. Patrick's Day
parade and I have a coronary...

01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:03.308
and 9,000 cops
march happily over my body.

01:37:03.383 --> 01:37:06.318
Friends. I haven't got a friend
on the force, either, Serpico.

01:37:06.386 --> 01:37:08.752
- I'll be your friend, Chief.
- I'm not lookin' for any.

01:37:08.822 --> 01:37:11.657
- I'll make an exception for you.
- Frank, you're a good cop.

01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:14.884
<i>Stop being a prima donna.
Cut out the shticklech.</i>

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:17.087
I don't understand.

01:37:17.162 --> 01:37:19.130
How am I being a prima donna?
I want to protect myself.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.297
We're gonna get the indictments.
You're gonna have to testify.

01:37:33.378 --> 01:37:37.246
<i>Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.</i>

01:37:37.315 --> 01:37:40.148
<i>Ready on the firing line.</i>

01:38:29.301 --> 01:38:31.735
What are you gonna tell
the grand jury, Frankie?

01:38:33.972 --> 01:38:36.065
Depends on
what they ask me.

01:38:36.141 --> 01:38:38.632
Suppose they ask you
who's taking money?

01:38:38.710 --> 01:38:40.974
What I don't know,
I don't know.

01:38:41.046 --> 01:38:43.776
But you do know, Frank.

01:38:43.849 --> 01:38:47.842
Look, Frankie, I like you. I don't
want to see anything happen to you.

01:38:47.919 --> 01:38:52.253
But you gotta understand,
a lot of people could get hurt here.

01:38:52.324 --> 01:38:55.885
I'm not saying anything's going to
happen. I'm saying it could happen.

01:38:55.961 --> 01:38:58.759
I mean, there's lots of ways.
Nobody has to take a shot at you.

01:38:58.830 --> 01:39:00.991
They can just not be there
when you need them.

01:39:01.066 --> 01:39:04.297
Somebody come at you with a gun,
they look the other way.

01:39:04.369 --> 01:39:06.462
Or they can send you
in first enough times...

01:39:06.538 --> 01:39:08.733
until finally one day you're gonna
walk in the wrong door.

01:39:12.878 --> 01:39:15.244
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, Frank!

01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:21.144
I have nothing more. Does anyone
have any further questions?

01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:24.484
- Yes, Mrs. Crist?
- If I may, Mr. Knowles, thank you.

01:39:24.556 --> 01:39:27.218
Officer Serpico came
to the 7th Division...

01:39:27.292 --> 01:39:29.226
more than a year
and a half ago.

01:39:29.294 --> 01:39:32.661
All during that time, the things
he's told us were taking place.

01:39:32.731 --> 01:39:35.393
Now, why didn't
Officer Serpico...

01:39:35.467 --> 01:39:39.528
report these criminal activities
when he first encountered them?

01:39:39.604 --> 01:39:42.767
- I'd like to answer that.
- Mr. Chairman...

01:39:42.841 --> 01:39:47.574
Mrs. Crist's question isn't material
or relevant to the present inquiry.

01:39:47.646 --> 01:39:49.876
- Although I want to make it clear...
- I'd like to answer that.

01:39:49.948 --> 01:39:53.543
Officer Serpico cannot be considered
derelict of his duty in any way...

01:39:53.618 --> 01:39:55.916
or guilty of
any infraction of the law.

01:39:55.987 --> 01:39:57.921
Quite the contrary.

01:39:57.989 --> 01:40:01.516
The District Attorney is not prepared
to say any more at this time.

01:40:01.593 --> 01:40:05.029
Very well. Officer Serpico,
thank you for your testimony.

01:40:05.096 --> 01:40:08.088
This hearing is adjourned
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

01:40:09.668 --> 01:40:12.660
Why didn't you tell him
about Delaney and Kellogg?

01:40:12.737 --> 01:40:15.535
Frank, this was a grand jury
about police officers...

01:40:15.607 --> 01:40:18.269
actively engaged in corruption.

01:40:18.343 --> 01:40:21.005
You don't implicate people
without sufficient evidence.

01:40:21.079 --> 01:40:25.015
That's crap and you know it, because
even a dumb cop like me knows...

01:40:25.083 --> 01:40:28.678
a prosecutor can take a grand jury
anywhere it wants to take it.

01:40:28.753 --> 01:40:31.449
Now, you never led me anywhere
near the real problems...

01:40:31.523 --> 01:40:34.788
Nothing about the bosses,
the brass...

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:37.727
how corruption like this could exist
without anybody knowing about it.

01:40:37.796 --> 01:40:40.390
Now, a few flunky cops
in the Bronx. That's it.

01:40:40.465 --> 01:40:43.161
None of the shit in Queens,
Brooklyn, Manhattan?

01:40:43.235 --> 01:40:45.135
While you're at it,
why don't you mention Kansas City?

01:40:45.203 --> 01:40:47.603
Well, "the biggest thing since
Harry Gross." That's what you said.

01:40:47.672 --> 01:40:50.106
All right! Look, Frank.

01:40:50.976 --> 01:40:53.945
You got guts, integrity.

01:40:54.012 --> 01:40:57.004
There's going to be a detective's
gold shield in this for you.

01:40:59.684 --> 01:41:03.176
Now, that's terrific.
That's good.

01:41:03.255 --> 01:41:04.847
Maybe this is
what it's all about.

01:41:04.923 --> 01:41:06.788
Maybe I should take my
gold shield and forget it.

01:41:06.858 --> 01:41:09.156
I know you've been through
an ordeal, Frank.

01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:15.422
I'm a marked man in this department.
For what?

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:18.833
- I've already arranged a transfer.
- To where? China?

01:41:30.782 --> 01:41:33.546
That takes a 14-shot clip.

01:41:33.618 --> 01:41:35.643
You expecting an army?

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.654
No, just a division.

01:41:39.591 --> 01:41:44.119
Tauber, did you know I've had
reports about Serpico being a fag?

01:41:44.195 --> 01:41:46.891
He used to hang out
in the BCI washroom.

01:41:46.965 --> 01:41:50.162
That's stupid, Commissioner,
and you know it.

01:41:50.235 --> 01:41:54.331
Mr. Commissioner, a gold shield
for Serpico at this time...

01:41:54.406 --> 01:41:56.033
would convince
a lot of people...

01:41:56.107 --> 01:41:57.631
Not while I'm commissioner.

01:42:16.861 --> 01:42:18.294
Commander's office?

01:42:20.765 --> 01:42:22.699
It's down that corridor.

01:42:25.670 --> 01:42:28.434
Hey, Serpico. Do you know what
they're saying in the Bronx?

01:42:28.506 --> 01:42:31.373
That you spilled your
guts to the grand jury.

01:42:32.377 --> 01:42:34.345
Say it isn't so, Serpico.

01:42:36.514 --> 01:42:38.209
It isn't so.

01:42:39.284 --> 01:42:41.377
We know how to handle
guys like you.

01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.588
I ought to cut
your tongue out.

01:42:50.428 --> 01:42:52.123
Don't move.

01:43:14.219 --> 01:43:16.483
Officer Serpico
reporting for duty, sir.

01:43:24.763 --> 01:43:27.732
I'm Inspector Lombardo.
I want to shake your hand, Frank.

01:43:29.534 --> 01:43:31.764
It's gonna be nice to have
a guy here I can trust.

01:43:33.505 --> 01:43:34.938
Anybody in this command
you want to work with?

01:43:38.543 --> 01:43:42.274
It's not who I want to work with.
It's who wants to work with me.

01:43:45.116 --> 01:43:48.677
All right. You can't find anybody
you want to work with, Frank...

01:43:48.753 --> 01:43:50.983
I'll work with you.

01:43:51.056 --> 01:43:52.990
Is that all right?

01:44:03.701 --> 01:44:05.692
How do we get past
the lookouts?

01:44:05.770 --> 01:44:07.499
How many you got?
One.

01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:11.243
There's two.

01:44:11.243 --> 01:44:12.608
There's two.

01:44:12.677 --> 01:44:15.475
- Yeah, there's a guy.
- There's three of them.

01:44:15.547 --> 01:44:17.742
It's four buildings away. We could
try to get down the fire escape.

01:44:17.816 --> 01:44:19.909
Get in behind him.
What do you think?

01:44:21.519 --> 01:44:23.851
- Look good to you?
- Yeah, let's go.

01:45:06.898 --> 01:45:08.991
What do you think?
Want to try it?

01:45:27.485 --> 01:45:29.715
- Oh, boy.
- You all right?

01:45:29.788 --> 01:45:31.722
Yeah. I feel just
like a cop again.

01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:34.054
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

01:46:02.487 --> 01:46:04.045
Close up!

01:46:06.891 --> 01:46:08.916
Wait, Frank!

01:46:08.993 --> 01:46:10.426
Come on!

01:46:19.871 --> 01:46:21.304
I ain't got nothing!

01:46:23.508 --> 01:46:25.442
Beat it, fuck face!

01:46:26.644 --> 01:46:30.080
Get the other one! Get out of here!
Get up against the wall.

01:46:33.985 --> 01:46:36.249
What the hell's goin' on here?
Who the hell are you?

01:46:36.321 --> 01:46:38.152
- Who are you?
- The police! Who the hell you think?

01:46:38.223 --> 01:46:40.851
Get the fuck against the wall.
Up, up, up!

01:46:40.925 --> 01:46:44.588
- Let me see your shield.
- All right. There's my shield.

01:46:44.662 --> 01:46:47.324
- Where are you from?
- The borough. Manhattan 8th.

01:46:47.399 --> 01:46:50.527
No, goddamn it! I just paid
the borough this morning!

01:46:53.104 --> 01:46:54.799
What the hell kind of
shakedown is this?

01:46:54.873 --> 01:46:56.966
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

01:46:58.643 --> 01:47:01.111
Nobody.
I didn't pay no...

01:47:01.179 --> 01:47:03.272
Who'd you pay
in the borough?

01:47:03.348 --> 01:47:06.511
I didn't pay nobody.
Now let go of me.

01:47:07.552 --> 01:47:12.148
We followed up,
and there's no doubt about it.

01:47:12.223 --> 01:47:15.624
The pad here in Manhattan
is bigger...

01:47:15.693 --> 01:47:20.426
and it's more sophisticated
than the one in the Bronx.

01:47:20.498 --> 01:47:23.524
The pickups here are made...
You want to get this...

01:47:23.601 --> 01:47:26.832
The pickups are made by...

01:47:26.905 --> 01:47:29.772
retired policemen.

01:47:29.841 --> 01:47:33.333
That way, no plainclothesmen
are directly involved.

01:47:33.411 --> 01:47:37.643
Now, we need investigative help
on this one, Chief.

01:47:39.484 --> 01:47:43.887
If you need investigative help
and you don't trust your own men...

01:47:43.955 --> 01:47:46.981
why don't you requisition some
recruits from the police academy?

01:47:55.266 --> 01:47:56.858
With all due respect,
sir...

01:47:58.903 --> 01:48:01.804
backing us up is the only hope
the police department has got.

01:48:01.873 --> 01:48:05.536
Good cops would come forward if they
thought there was encouragement...

01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:07.942
in the department to do so, and if
they thought it would do any good.

01:48:08.012 --> 01:48:09.946
If there's no encouragement,
they're not gonna do it.

01:48:10.014 --> 01:48:13.575
I've done a lot more than most
people to defend and preserve...

01:48:13.651 --> 01:48:17.087
the image of this department
and protect Commissioner Delaney...

01:48:17.155 --> 01:48:21.057
against reckless and irresponsible
assaults from outside agencies.

01:48:22.961 --> 01:48:24.895
That's it, huh?

01:48:24.963 --> 01:48:28.626
I mean, that's what's
really important, isn't it?

01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:30.793
That's what
you want to know...

01:48:30.869 --> 01:48:34.134
what outside agencies
I've been to, right?

01:48:35.673 --> 01:48:37.436
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, prick.</i>

01:48:37.509 --> 01:48:39.636
- Who is this?
- Frank.

01:48:40.512 --> 01:48:43.481
<i>- How are you? Where are you?
- I'm ready to go to the Times.</i>

01:48:44.449 --> 01:48:48.545
It's a goddamn
serious step, Frank.

01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:51.214
I don't know if
the timing is right.

01:48:53.925 --> 01:48:56.723
Look, I want it to get on
the record, that's all...

01:48:56.794 --> 01:48:59.228
in case something
should happen to me.

01:49:02.767 --> 01:49:04.860
I want it on the record.

01:49:07.872 --> 01:49:09.305
I don't know if we
carry enough weight.

01:49:10.975 --> 01:49:13.068
<i>I don't know if the New York Times
will go that far out on a limb...</i>

01:49:13.144 --> 01:49:15.408
on the say-so
of two flunky cops.

01:49:19.717 --> 01:49:22.447
Suppose an inspector
were to come with us?

01:49:24.088 --> 01:49:27.489
You know, I got 20 years
on the force.

01:49:27.559 --> 01:49:31.893
Just bought this place.
I signed a 500-year mortgage on it.

01:49:31.963 --> 01:49:35.194
- Turn that thing off out there!
- Come on. Everybody to bed.

01:49:35.266 --> 01:49:37.291
- Aw, Mom!
- Turn that damn thing down!

01:49:37.368 --> 01:49:39.302
Come on, now.
Go on upstairs.

01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:41.429
You said we could go
to bed late!

01:49:43.107 --> 01:49:46.008
This is against department
regulations, you both know that.

01:49:46.077 --> 01:49:50.377
If they want to throw the book
at me, they can do it.

01:49:50.448 --> 01:49:52.541
If I left the force...

01:49:53.918 --> 01:49:56.011
I don't know
what I could do.

01:50:01.826 --> 01:50:05.762
Okay, I made my little speech.
I'll back you up a hundred percent.

01:50:09.734 --> 01:50:12.965
<i>Times and the News.
I got the money, fellas.</i>

01:50:13.037 --> 01:50:14.971
Here you go, here you go,
here you go.

01:50:15.039 --> 01:50:16.472
<i>Newsweek, please.</i>

01:50:18.876 --> 01:50:20.810
Holy sh... Jeez!

01:50:23.147 --> 01:50:24.774
Aw, Christ!

01:50:24.849 --> 01:50:27.716
You could almost predict
the numbers they're gonna do.

01:50:27.785 --> 01:50:30.049
Delaney's gonna issue
some phony denial.

01:50:30.121 --> 01:50:33.090
Somebody from the mayor's office
will say something noble.

01:50:33.157 --> 01:50:37.787
Delaney'll change his tune. Finally,
the mayor will appoint a commission.

01:50:37.862 --> 01:50:41.059
"Mayor Lindsay announced the
formation of a five-man committee...

01:50:41.132 --> 01:50:43.965
to review the city procedures for
investigating police corruption."

01:50:44.035 --> 01:50:47.095
How come I'm not
in the first paragraph?

01:50:47.171 --> 01:50:48.604
Unbelievable!

01:50:52.877 --> 01:50:57.280
<i>The Times' report smells
of the familiar smear tactics...</i>

01:50:57.348 --> 01:50:59.373
of McCarthyism.

01:50:59.450 --> 01:51:03.910
<i>- I have issued a statement...
- We here at city hall...</i>

01:51:03.988 --> 01:51:06.684
The mayor appointed a special
investigation commission...

01:51:06.758 --> 01:51:08.692
<i>to be headed
by Whitman Knapp.</i>

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.193
Yeah, come.

01:51:15.266 --> 01:51:20.704
It's your reward. It's a transfer
to narcotics, Brooklyn South.

01:51:20.772 --> 01:51:23.935
You're still in clothes. You get
a tin shield, not a gold one.

01:51:28.713 --> 01:51:30.647
I miss you already, Frank.

01:51:35.687 --> 01:51:38.884
Look, Frank...

01:51:41.626 --> 01:51:44.288
it's narcotics.

01:51:44.362 --> 01:51:46.887
You be careful.

01:51:46.964 --> 01:51:50.368
It's very easy to get hurt...

01:51:51.902 --> 01:51:53.335
and to...

01:51:54.939 --> 01:51:56.634
to be set up.

01:52:38.682 --> 01:52:40.707
Get in.

01:52:57.668 --> 01:52:59.761
You're not wired,
are you?

01:53:00.871 --> 01:53:02.736
Okay, you cocksucker.

01:53:04.241 --> 01:53:07.267
You might get by in the Bronx
with that kind of shit...

01:53:07.344 --> 01:53:10.745
but down here,
800 a month is chicken feed.

01:53:12.383 --> 01:53:15.147
Last week,
one dope dealer...

01:53:15.219 --> 01:53:18.279
sent out these guys
making pickups.

01:53:18.355 --> 01:53:20.846
40,000 each.

01:53:20.925 --> 01:53:24.224
We let 'em collect it all,
and then hit 'em.

01:53:24.295 --> 01:53:27.890
120,000 split four ways.

01:53:28.966 --> 01:53:31.366
That's serious money.

01:53:31.435 --> 01:53:34.996
And with that,
you don't fuck around.

01:53:36.774 --> 01:53:39.174
- I got the message.
- Good.

01:53:39.977 --> 01:53:41.410
Now get the fuck out.

01:53:48.085 --> 01:53:49.518
The guy's name is Limbo.

01:53:49.587 --> 01:53:51.919
He just uses this place,
his girlfriend's brother's place.

01:53:51.989 --> 01:53:54.549
He's a pusher... heroin.

01:53:54.625 --> 01:53:56.889
- We'll drive around to the corner.
- Right.

01:53:56.961 --> 01:54:00.624
You keep in sight out front. When
you spot somebody who's dirty...

01:54:00.698 --> 01:54:02.791
take off your glasses
and wipe 'em.

01:54:02.867 --> 01:54:05.392
- Got it?
- Right. Okay.

01:55:13.704 --> 01:55:16.172
We stay around here very long,
we're gonna get spotted.

01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:19.835
Well, Frank, why don't you
go up there and check it out?

01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:23.209
- Why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.

01:55:23.281 --> 01:55:26.011
I'll take you shopping.

01:57:10.688 --> 01:57:12.121
Limbo.

01:57:45.156 --> 01:57:46.885
Police. Freeze!

01:57:46.958 --> 01:57:48.983
Police officer.
All right, up against the wall.

01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:53.292
Get your hands up against that wall.
Get up. All right.

01:57:53.364 --> 01:57:56.265
- Palms on the wall and spread 'em.
- Get those hands up!

01:57:56.334 --> 01:57:58.393
- Come on. Spread 'em!
- Get your feet apart.

01:57:59.437 --> 01:58:01.462
- I saw the buy.
- Let's get Limbo. Julio!

01:58:01.539 --> 01:58:03.803
- You all right, baby?
- Yeah, yeah. I got 'em.

01:59:07.872 --> 01:59:09.737
Police officer!

01:59:19.884 --> 01:59:21.852
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:24.981
Go down the fire escape!

01:59:41.139 --> 01:59:44.802
Police! Throw out your guns
and come out with your hands up!

02:00:19.076 --> 02:00:22.239
- Wait. What do you got here?
- It's Mr. and Mrs. Serpico, sir.

02:00:22.313 --> 02:00:24.247
Okay. Go ahead.

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:32.512
- Where's our son?
- They're bringing him from X-ray.

02:00:32.590 --> 02:00:35.024
- We want to see him.
- Just a few minutes.

02:01:03.154 --> 02:01:05.088
Mr. and Mrs. Serpico...

02:01:05.156 --> 02:01:09.252
the news is better
than we expected.

02:01:09.327 --> 02:01:13.627
Thank God the bullet
was a small caliber.

02:01:13.698 --> 02:01:15.233
It didn't enter the brain...

02:01:16.901 --> 02:01:18.994
or strike the spinal cord.

02:01:20.471 --> 02:01:22.996
He's on the critical list...

02:01:23.074 --> 02:01:26.271
but his condition
seems to be stable.

02:01:27.612 --> 02:01:29.443
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.

02:02:03.414 --> 02:02:06.577
Stay out of there.
Didn't they tell you?

02:02:06.651 --> 02:02:08.118
What?

02:02:08.185 --> 02:02:11.552
The word is, don't talk to him.
He's no fuckin' good.

02:02:21.432 --> 02:02:24.026
- How you doing, kid?
- Hello, Sid.

02:02:30.775 --> 02:02:32.709
How are you?

02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:38.314
You wanna read my fan mail?

02:02:38.382 --> 02:02:40.316
Sure.

02:02:40.384 --> 02:02:42.477
You're a big shot now, huh?

02:03:10.715 --> 02:03:14.310
I want you to get those
fucking cops away from my door.

02:03:25.129 --> 02:03:28.690
The Knapp Commission likes you.
They want you to appear.

02:03:28.766 --> 02:03:30.290
Naturally.

02:03:35.139 --> 02:03:36.572
Heinemann and Julio
are cleared.

02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:39.200
The three of you are up for
exceptional merit awards.

02:03:40.745 --> 02:03:42.679
That's very funny.

02:03:47.985 --> 02:03:50.453
That's very funny.

02:03:51.689 --> 02:03:53.122
Francesco, you love me?

02:03:55.426 --> 02:03:57.860
I always had a thing for you, Sid.
You know that.

02:04:02.333 --> 02:04:04.426
Your gold shield's
come through.

02:04:33.164 --> 02:04:35.098
What's this for?

02:04:38.702 --> 02:04:41.398
For being an honest cop?

02:04:43.808 --> 02:04:46.971
Or for being stupid enough
to get shot in the face?

02:04:51.382 --> 02:04:54.351
You tell them
they can shove it.

02:04:59.890 --> 02:05:01.755
I don't want it.

02:05:40.698 --> 02:05:42.131
Oh, well.

02:05:47.338 --> 02:05:49.898
Well, Frank,
the facts are these.

02:05:49.974 --> 02:05:53.603
You'll have to stay on leave
of absence for a few months.

02:05:53.677 --> 02:05:57.545
In all probability, the hearing
in your left ear won't come back.

02:05:57.615 --> 02:06:00.243
Two bullet fragments are still
lodged there in the bony portion.

02:06:00.317 --> 02:06:01.944
One is very close to
the carotid artery...

02:06:02.019 --> 02:06:04.783
<i>and you'll have to be checked
from time to time.</i>

02:06:04.855 --> 02:06:07.255
<i>Your left side will
feel stiff occasionally.</i>

02:06:08.425 --> 02:06:11.588
<i>Once in a great while you may
experience some dizziness.</i>

02:06:11.662 --> 02:06:13.789
<i>But in general,
you'll be okay.</i>

02:06:32.249 --> 02:06:34.547
Through my appearance
here today...

02:06:34.618 --> 02:06:37.644
I hope that police officers in
the future will not experience...

02:06:37.721 --> 02:06:41.316
the same frustration and anxiety
that I was subjected to...

02:06:41.392 --> 02:06:44.691
for the past five years
at the hands of my superiors...

02:06:44.762 --> 02:06:47.697
because of my attempt
to report corruption.

02:06:47.765 --> 02:06:52.532
I was made to feel that I had
burdened them with an unwanted task.

02:06:52.603 --> 02:06:56.164
The problem is that the atmosphere
does not yet exist...

02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:58.174
in which an honest police officer
can act...

02:06:58.242 --> 02:07:02.906
without fear of ridicule
or reprisal from fellow officers.

02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:06.575
Police corruption cannot exist
unless it is at least tolerated...

02:07:06.650 --> 02:07:08.777
at higher levels
in the department.

02:07:08.852 --> 02:07:12.185
Therefore, the most important result
that can come from these hearings...

02:07:12.256 --> 02:07:16.386
is a conviction by police officers
that the department will change.

02:07:17.194 --> 02:07:18.627
In order to ensure this...

02:07:18.696 --> 02:07:21.688
an independent,
permanent investigative body...

02:07:21.765 --> 02:07:25.565
dealing with police corruption,
like this commission, is essential.
