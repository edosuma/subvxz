WEBVTT

00:15.265 --> 00:17.972
No, there's so much blood here.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.599
Damn it. Still not enough light.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.560
Harold: I turned them all up
as high as they'll go.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.647
Never mind.
Frannie, wipe my forehead off.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.812
I'm sweating like a pig.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.944
Fran: You okay?

00:48.090 --> 00:51.503
Wait a minute. Give me the scissors.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.631
Can you see it, east Texas?

00:55.973 --> 00:58.009
Stu:
That's his appendix right there.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.306
Dayna: Stu?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.056
Stu: No, the small one.

01:03.772 --> 01:04.978
Stu?

01:05.774 --> 01:06.774
Stu?

01:06.942 --> 01:08.853
What, dayna, what?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.856
You don't need to.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.271
What do you mean?
We're almost there.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.573
He's dead, St...

01:19.246 --> 01:21.328
Please

01:22.541 --> 01:24.497
cover him up.

01:47.649 --> 01:51.858
I am the resurrection and the light.

01:52.613 --> 01:58.324
Whosoever believeth in me
shall not perish.

02:00.078 --> 02:04.321
There's more, I suppose,
but I don't remember it

02:04.499 --> 02:07.707
it worked for me, judge. Amen.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.372
Amen.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.431
Hey.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.331
Good morning, Mr. lauder.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.373
Where the hell is everybody?

02:53.548 --> 02:56.631
Dayna's still asleep.
I don't know where Fran is.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.751
I think stu went fishing.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.636
Off catching lunch
in the big two-hearted river.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.388
Figures.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.428
I beg pardon?

03:05.852 --> 03:07.217
Oh, nothing.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.595
The judge and I thought
we'd take a little ride into town

03:09.773 --> 03:10.773
and go cb shopping.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.351
Wanna come?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.266
I'll pass.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.184
Just as you like.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.181
Hi

03:54.860 --> 03:56.270
Hi

03:56.486 --> 03:58.226
Still thinking about Mark?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.230
It's not just that.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.987
I had a dream
with the scary one last night.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.486
It was by far the worst one yet.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.952
There were all these crosses
on highway 15.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.789
Oh, yeah. Made out of barn beams
and telephone poles, right?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.832
With people hanging off of them.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.042
You too?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.258
Yeah

04:19.426 --> 04:24.420
and dayna and Glen, judge farris.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.966
Okay if I sit down?

04:26.183 --> 04:29.425
Yeah of course.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.726
I dreamed about him
the night Mark died.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.354
Last night, I drew the old lady.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.811
Oh, that one's much better.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.362
Yeah, a whole lot better.

04:42.532 --> 04:46.571
She was on a porch,
but it's not the same one as before.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.866
I think she and the first bunch
have finally made it to Boulder.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.905
Oh, I know they have.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.333
She said:

04:55.837 --> 04:58.499
"You got to move them along
faster still, Stuart.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.709
One day off's all you get.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.296
Mind you, keep picking up strays
along the way."

05:05.222 --> 05:07.213
It's so weird.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.507
How can we all be having
the same dream like this?

05:13.438 --> 05:15.224
I don't know.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.659
Uh, you know,
Glen's got some sleeping pills

05:28.829 --> 05:30.990
in his little traveling pharmacy.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.658
You want me to ask him
to give you one?

05:33.792 --> 05:34.998
Thank you, but no.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.332
You sure? You'll get a good night's rest
before we have to hit the road again.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.417
I can't.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.795
Why not?

05:46.388 --> 05:48.128
I'm afraid it'll hurt the baby.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.956
Have you told Harold?

06:29.848 --> 06:31.634
When are you due?

06:32.058 --> 06:33.798
January.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.857
Harold?

08:50.113 --> 08:52.695
We have something to tell you. Um...

08:55.410 --> 08:57.526
I don't know really how to say it.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.078
I think I have a pretty good idea.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.039
Congratulations.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.160
Fran thought you might be a little...

09:07.338 --> 09:10.171
Harold: Jealous? Angry?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.128
Something like that, yeah.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.509
Harold: Well, jealous, yeah.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.261
Angry...

09:17.682 --> 09:19.422
That's life.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.023
I've got something to tell you.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.650
Couldn't say it up until now.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.442
I love you, frannie.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.289
Thank you, Harold.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.992
And I believe I owe you an apology.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.791
Hey, that's all right.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.631
Still friends, right, guys?

09:53.843 --> 09:55.754
Of course. Stu: Yeah

09:55.929 --> 09:57.669
(00d deal.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.763
You need any help with that?

10:03.978 --> 10:05.593
No, everything's under control.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.478
You sure, now?

10:23.164 --> 10:25.280
Perfectly under control.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.164
My life for you!

11:33.484 --> 11:36.567
Cibola.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.318
Seven-in-one.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.241
My life for you.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.208
How are you feeling, man?

11:53.504 --> 11:55.586
I'm okay.

11:56.758 --> 11:57.758
Who are you?

11:57.926 --> 11:59.882
This here is Lloyd henreid.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.377
He ain't bad
for a slice of wonder bread.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.761
I'm the rat-man.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.968
Bold, black, beautiful.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.509
Pleased to meet you, trash.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.019
How'd you know people back home
used to call me that?

12:12.190 --> 12:15.899
Gotta do something about
that talking-in-your-sleep thing.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.813
Listen.

12:19.822 --> 12:23.781
I didn't know your exact sizes,
but these ought to be okay.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.824
Am I going somewhere?

12:26.037 --> 12:27.322
Yeah. Flagg wants to see you.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.741
My life for him. Yes.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.284
My life for him.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.128
Dude's crazy.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.249
I ike we're not?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.135
Get dressed.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.866
Flagg: The trashcan man.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.956
How good it is to see you.

13:18.631 --> 13:23.921
My life for you.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.131
I don't think it'll come to that.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.262
There's work for you in the desert,
trash.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.730
Great work if you want it.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.771
Anything. Anything.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.730
My life for you.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.326
I love you.

14:40.088 --> 14:43.580
I know. I know you do.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.885
And I'm gonna
fulfill all your dreams, trash.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.759
Come.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.596
Let's talk about your future.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.083
Fran: Mother abagail.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.336
I dreamed about you.

15:24.215 --> 15:27.002
I know you did.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.469
Come on up here.

15:32.849 --> 15:36.467
Just you and your man to start with.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.593
Come on.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.971
You're with child, little girl.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.606
How did you know that?

15:45.987 --> 15:47.773
How do, Stuart?

15:47.989 --> 15:48.989
Welcome to Boulder.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.363
Fran: Nice to meet you, Ralph.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.324
Ralph: Nice to meet you.
That there's Susan stern.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.614
Fran: Good to meet you, Susan.
Susan: Hi

15:55.788 --> 15:57.244
how'd you know my name?

15:59.750 --> 16:02.537
You're all welcome here.

16:02.753 --> 16:07.122
Come on in. Let's us visit a spell.

16:07.300 --> 16:11.418
Seems there were more here before.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.762
Harold's gone.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.560
Well, come on in, now.
I made some lemonade.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.722
Farris: Very pleased to see you.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.143
I'm here.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.562
I came to you.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.486
Flagg:
The bride cometh to the bridegroom

16:34.619 --> 16:37.281
as a flame to the wick of a lamp.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.788
Is that the Bible?

16:41.584 --> 16:44.166
Flagg: Danielle steel, I think.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.293
I ook here.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.881
Nadine.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.584
Nadine.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.796
My love.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.139
You okay, ma'am?

17:02.897 --> 17:06.515
Um, of course I am. Why?

17:06.692 --> 17:08.557
Well, you were having a bad dream.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.151
Must have been a real wowzer
by the sound.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.571
Was it about him?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.485
The walkin dude.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.200
Uh

17:18.871 --> 17:21.032
I don't remember.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.572
Teddy:
We're making real good time.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.916
They must have cleared the road
all the way from julesburg.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.203
How long till we get there?

17:28.339 --> 17:31.297
Two hours. Three at the most.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.128
Look, you can see the mountains.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.336
Stu: Summer's almost gone.
Can't believe it.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.842
Glen: How the time flies when you're
having fun, right, east Texas?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.848
How so?

18:29.275 --> 18:32.142
Oh, the power station. Oh, yeah.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.685
I can't believe you forgot that.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.570
I didn't forget it. I blocked it out.

18:36.741 --> 18:39.824
The plague took the people, but it
couldn't take the gadgets, could it?

18:39.994 --> 18:41.905
No, they're all still out there.

18:42.079 --> 18:45.446
Everything from electric can openers
to cobalt bombs,

18:45.625 --> 18:48.458
just waiting for someone
to come along and pick them up.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.085
And the scavenger hunt starts today.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.791
Now, hell, professor.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.798
What's so bad about putting
the rocks back in people's scotch?

18:56.010 --> 18:59.969
Glen: It's the old way.
And the old way was a death trip.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.657
That's a little heavy, don't you think?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.339
Do you?

19:03.768 --> 19:07.056
There's an old woman down there who
might tell you different, east Texas.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.354
If she'd talk about this end of it at all,
that is.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.931
What's the problem?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.474
Glen:
I don't know if there is one.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.361
But I know I'm very concerned
about the way things are going.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.647
She wants a mass meeting.

19:20.368 --> 19:24.202
Except she says it's really god
who wants the meeting.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.660
We say, "fine. You're fine, mother.
God's fine too."

19:27.833 --> 19:30.370
And then we go right back
to tinkering with the power station,

19:30.503 --> 19:31.788
trying to re-create the world

19:31.962 --> 19:34.419
that damn near choked
the human race to death.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.123
What's wrong with this picture?

19:58.197 --> 20:01.030
Well, take a look at that.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.205
Wait

20:50.458 --> 20:53.916
You're all welcome here.

20:54.086 --> 20:58.420
Come on, now.
Come on up and say howdy.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.101
Flagg: Go to her

21:17.902 --> 21:20.769
You're real. You're really real.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.736
No, get up. I ain't no god.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.610
And I ain't gonna be
no golden calf either.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.155
Zellman: Dave zellman.
Rouse's point, New York.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.819
I dreamed of you, mother abagalil.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.534
Abagail:
Oh, I'm so glad to have you come.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.916
I'm Marcy halloran, mother abagall,
from Cleveland.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.747
I dreamed of you too.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.335
Man: Mother abagail, I'm...

21:42.510 --> 21:43.545
Larry.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.425
Larry: She's so gray, St...

21:45.596 --> 21:46.711
Stu: Who?

21:46.889 --> 21:48.049
Larry: I know her.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.009
Hey, hold it.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.264
Abagail: All right, dear.

21:55.439 --> 21:59.648
Come on. Oh, yes, yes. Yes.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.063
Who's this woman who comes?

22:04.865 --> 22:06.696
Flagg: Go to her

22:10.621 --> 22:12.828
my name is Nadine cross.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.284
Mayhap it is and mayhap it ain't.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.871
I'm from New York.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.410
Abagail: Mayhap you are.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.663
And mayhap I ain't.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.711
I won't keep you long.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.628
You look so tired.

22:28.806 --> 22:33.391
Of course, anyone your age
is bound to tire easily, isn't that so?

22:33.978 --> 22:35.639
Joe: Mother abagail.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.271
Hello, Joe. What do you know?
Ha-ha-ha.

22:41.110 --> 22:44.068
- What the hell?
Nadine: Leave me alone, please.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.283
Hello, Nadine.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.157
You gonna leave again
without saying goodbye?

22:58.586 --> 22:59.586
I said I had my reasons.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.633
I didn't wanna answer
questions and still don't,

23:01.797 --> 23:02.832
so just leave me alone.

23:25.529 --> 23:28.396
I'm ready, Brad.
All battery power is up and running.

23:33.704 --> 23:36.787
Listen up, folks.
We're about ready to go for it here.

23:37.666 --> 23:41.500
It might not be such a bad idea
to keep the nearest exit in mind.

23:46.008 --> 23:49.000
Okay, sweetheart. Let's light them up.

24:00.064 --> 24:02.055
I'm scared.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.687
I'm a little scared myself.

24:06.987 --> 24:11.071
- Green board. I've got green across.
Brad: All right.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.137
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back!

24:35.265 --> 24:37.176
Yeah

24:52.282 --> 24:55.945
Abagail: There was something
in that woman this morning.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.576
Was it him?

24:58.372 --> 25:01.785
I don't know, lord,
she passed on by so quick.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.955
No that ain't it.

25:06.130 --> 25:09.748
And I'm too old to be making excuses

25:09.925 --> 25:13.463
to the god of my understanding.

25:17.141 --> 25:20.349
I have sinned in complacency

25:20.519 --> 25:23.431
and sinned in pride.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.597
Sitting back in my rocker like a queen,

25:26.775 --> 25:28.811
and letting them come to me.

25:28.986 --> 25:32.774
Letting them do everything
but bow down before me.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.487
Oh, my lord.

25:34.658 --> 25:37.024
Oh, what am I to do?

25:37.536 --> 25:40.118
Show me how to go, lord.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.947
I'm listening.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.231
Stu: This ain't on the...

27:36.905 --> 27:39.521
Guess we're all gonna
have to get used to this again, huh?

27:50.919 --> 27:53.706
Uh, what I started to say was,

27:53.881 --> 27:57.590
I wonder if maybe we couldn't start
by singing the national anthem.

28:03.432 --> 28:07.892
O say can you see

28:08.061 --> 28:13.101
by the dawn's early light

28:13.233 --> 28:18.899
what so proudly we hailed

28:19.031 --> 28:24.321
at the twilight's last gleaming

28:24.494 --> 28:29.955
whose broad stripes
and bright stars

28:30.125 --> 28:35.210
through the perilous fight

28:35.380 --> 28:40.750
o'er the ramparts we watched

28:40.928 --> 28:46.514
were so gallantly streaming?

28:46.683 --> 28:52.019
And the rockets' red glare

28:52.189 --> 28:57.149
the bombs bursting in air

28:57.903 --> 29:03.443
gave proof through the night

29:03.617 --> 29:08.987
that our flag was still there

29:09.665 --> 29:17.665
o say does that
star-spangled banner yet wave

29:23.387 --> 29:30.350
O'er the land of the free

29:30.519 --> 29:38.519
and the home of the brave?

29:59.840 --> 30:02.832
Abagail: Thy will be done, lord.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.556
Well, I'm pretty nervous up here,
so I hope you'll all bear with me.

30:11.727 --> 30:12.967
Man: We will, St...

30:15.856 --> 30:17.016
Hey, I'm on this.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.101
I'll make this as painless as possible

30:19.234 --> 30:21.725
so we can all get out of here
and have a beer.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.365
Stu: First off,

30:32.539 --> 30:37.579
I'd like you to meet the man
who got the juice on again.

30:37.753 --> 30:41.211
Brad kitchner, stand up, take a bow.

30:48.889 --> 30:52.507
Okay, next thing's
this so-called free zone committee.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.551
The names
came from mother abagail.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.519
Where 1s mother abagail?

30:57.647 --> 31:00.059
- I haven't seen her all day.
Stu: But this is still America.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.144
I'm sure she's around someplace.

31:02.277 --> 31:06.111
And I guess whatever starts with her
still has to end with us.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.029
That means a vote.

31:08.158 --> 31:11.616
First, though, I'd like you to meet
the folks you'll be voting on.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.448
I'm one of them.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.363
Stu redman from arnette, Texas.

31:23.048 --> 31:28.008
Next is Nick andros,
originally from Ridley, Pennsylvania.

31:28.178 --> 31:31.341
And Ralph brentner from okie city.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.892
Miss Frances goldsmith
from ogunquit, Maine.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.808
Stand up, frannie. Let them see
how pretty you look with a dress on.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.357
Brad kitchner's good friend,
Susan stern

31:52.536 --> 31:54.948
from Tacoma, Washington.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.785
Mr. Glen Bateman
from woodsville, New Hampshire.

32:02.963 --> 32:06.672
And Larry Underwood
from New York City.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.328
- You see where Lucy and Joe went?
Stu: Those are the names

32:17.352 --> 32:19.183
mother abagall told us
to put on the list.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.011
Maybe she took him to the bathroom.

32:21.273 --> 32:24.686
If any of you other folks
have any other ideas...

32:24.860 --> 32:28.523
Harold:
Mr. chairman. Mr. chairman?

32:34.411 --> 32:37.198
Chair recognizes Harold lauder.

32:39.875 --> 32:44.539
I move that we accept
mother abagail's free zone committee

32:45.213 --> 32:47.078
in Toto.

32:47.257 --> 32:49.464
If they'll all serve, that is.

32:51.011 --> 32:54.094
Brilliant, utterly brilliant.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.134
Judge, can we do that?

33:01.438 --> 33:02.803
You're damn right, you can.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.848
And I, for one,
think it's a damn good idea.

33:07.110 --> 33:11.695
Folks, it's been moved
and seconded that we accept

33:11.865 --> 33:15.073
the entire committee
as listed on the agenda.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.860
I guess I ought to ask

33:17.996 --> 33:20.533
if there's anybody on the list
who wants to step down.

33:24.794 --> 33:27.752
A voice vote will do just fine.

33:30.634 --> 33:34.547
Well, those in favor of accepting
the committee as it stands?

33:34.679 --> 33:36.795
Sea eas a eat

33:36.973 --> 33:38.679
opposed?

34:14.427 --> 34:16.418
Oh, no.

34:16.930 --> 34:18.966
Oh, no.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.131
She can't.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.348
Joe?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.774
There ought to be
a turning-off committee.

34:39.953 --> 34:42.695
Having the power back on is great,
but you gotta realize

34:42.872 --> 34:44.392
people didn't
get out of their sickbeds

34:44.541 --> 34:47.453
and turn off all their appliances
before they died.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.333
Lucy: She's gone.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.128
She's gone.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.841
Mother abagail, she's gone.

34:57.012 --> 35:00.630
Larry:
Lucy, what is it? What happened?

35:15.280 --> 35:17.020
Glen: "I must be gone a bit now.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.656
I've sinned and presumed to know
the mind of god.

35:20.827 --> 35:24.866
I must try to find my place
in his work again."

35:24.998 --> 35:26.659
She scribbled a reference
at the bottom.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.199
Proverbs 11, verse 3.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.914
When pride cometh,
then cometh shame.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.329
But with the lowly is wisdom.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.217
All right, what now?

35:44.601 --> 35:47.138
"This doesn't change much,
if anything.

35:47.312 --> 35:50.054
We dreamed of mother abagail
and she was real.

35:50.231 --> 35:54.144
That makes it a pretty sure bet
that the other guy is real too.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.943
But we have to find out
all we can about him.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.980
That probably means
sending spies west."

36:00.408 --> 36:01.648
Spies”?

36:01.826 --> 36:05.318
"It's a nasty thing to think about,
but we will do what we have to do.

36:06.206 --> 36:09.039
Flagg is our business right now.

36:09.209 --> 36:12.576
And we'll have to trust mother abagaill
to her god."

36:13.755 --> 36:16.292
Our friend in the cowboy boots
and Jean jacket

36:16.466 --> 36:18.923
isn't gonna just sit over there
on his side of the rockies

36:19.094 --> 36:20.880
playing mumblety-peg, you know.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.854
If he's planning to come east
and attack us...

36:23.014 --> 36:24.800
Ralph: Or nuke us.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.635
We ought to know about it.

36:27.727 --> 36:30.969
All right. Let's talk about flagg.

36:32.232 --> 36:35.520
How do we look
into his part of the world?

36:42.409 --> 36:44.445
Damn kid.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.111
Mess with my guitar.

36:53.712 --> 36:54.792
Nadine: Larry?

37:06.683 --> 37:07.843
Lucy: Honey?

37:11.813 --> 37:13.974
Yeah. Go inside, baby.

37:15.859 --> 37:18.566
Lucy: Who's...?
- I have to talk to you, Larry.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.729
Yeah come on inside.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.316
Nadine: No.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.277
Out here.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.567
Please?

37:30.248 --> 37:33.240
Is she the woman
that came out of New York with you?

37:33.710 --> 37:35.496
Yeah. Go inside, baby.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.127
I'll handle this.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.021
What are you doing here, Nadine?

38:01.237 --> 38:04.479
Messing up your happy home.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.538
Maybe I came to say I'm sorry.

38:14.459 --> 38:20.329
I'm so sorry for the way I left you.

38:21.049 --> 38:25.383
And then for the way I said hello.

38:26.387 --> 38:31.381
I was just so surprised to see you.

38:31.768 --> 38:34.259
Yeah fine.

38:35.897 --> 38:37.512
Okay. Apology accepted.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.897
That was easy, wasn't it?

38:40.944 --> 38:42.730
Is she nice?

38:43.696 --> 38:45.277
Lucy.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.321
She's the best.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.153
(00d.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.454
I'm glad for you.

38:59.379 --> 39:00.960
Nadine.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.919
Nadine.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.274
Nadine:
I made a mistake when I left you.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.315
I know that now.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.985
The way it was tonight
at the meeting.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.078
The love

39:37.208 --> 39:39.494
and the light.

39:40.503 --> 39:42.539
I wanna stay here, Larry.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.298
Make love to me
and I can stay here.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.299
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:48.469 --> 39:50.334
Nadine: Shh.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.967
It doesn't matter.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.764
Make love to me, Larry.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.805
Make love to me
and everything will be all right.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.565
And we'll take care of each other.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.359
You come here
and you look right through my wife.

40:11.534 --> 40:12.534
Your wife?

40:12.702 --> 40:14.613
Yeah, that's right. My wife.

40:15.413 --> 40:19.201
Don't you understand? It's too late.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.126
Do you understand that?

40:21.294 --> 40:25.003
Yes. I suppose I do.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.876
You work it out, Nadine.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.672
Nadine?

41:16.265 --> 41:19.223
- Did you come back for your things?
- No, don't.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.935
She's gone.

41:23.106 --> 41:26.314
I don't know what she wanted,
but she's gone now.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.152
I love you, Lucy.

41:45.253 --> 41:49.212
Just work it out.

41:49.924 --> 41:54.839
Oh, you are so wise, Larry.

41:54.971 --> 41:57.963
Very, very wise.

42:02.562 --> 42:07.181
So very, very wise.

42:32.592 --> 42:34.878
Now, go to Harold.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.669
But remember
who you really belong to.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.980
Ralph: Hey, chow. Bring it on.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.482
Consider it brung.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.981
You're the perfect American male, St...

42:58.159 --> 43:00.150
We get the power back
and you decide to barbecue.

43:00.328 --> 43:03.570
Yeah, well, as soon as they bring back
pork rinds and Monday night football,

43:03.748 --> 43:05.158
I'm gonna be in redneck heaven.

43:05.291 --> 43:08.875
Nick's proposal is that we send at least
three people west to Las Vegas,

43:09.378 --> 43:13.212
which we all seem to feel
is this flagg's base of operations.

43:13.883 --> 43:17.922
The purpose is to try and find out
what flagg's plans are for us.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.712
Anybody wanna kick it around
7 little bit?

43:20.890 --> 43:23.677
Well, we haven't been elected
one whole day yet

43:23.810 --> 43:27.598
and already we've managed
to, uh, reinvent the CIA.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.015
Who needs Monday night football?

43:29.190 --> 43:30.910
Ralph:
Well, what the hell else we gonna do?

43:31.859 --> 43:33.065
All he needs is one guy

43:33.152 --> 43:36.610
to target some scud missile
with an a-bomb on it

43:36.781 --> 43:39.193
and if he's got one, what then?

43:39.367 --> 43:42.530
Stu: Somebody will have to try
and stop him from using it.

43:43.079 --> 43:45.479
Susan: I wanna be one of the three.
Glen: That's commendable,

43:45.623 --> 43:48.330
but I'm afraid it's out of the question.
Why?

43:48.501 --> 43:52.414
Because we don't know
if any of our scouts will make it back.

43:52.588 --> 43:56.126
Meanwhile, we seven have
the not inconsiderable job

43:56.300 --> 43:59.133
of getting the free zone
on a paying basis.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.009
That's the job you took last night,
Susan.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.967
You may not like it,
but that doesn't change it.

44:04.142 --> 44:07.100
Oh, my god, I'm a politician.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.261
This isn't Colorado, it's hell.

44:09.438 --> 44:10.803
Okay.

44:10.982 --> 44:15.021
If that's the way we play,
I nominate judge farris.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.526
Susan:
That old man? You must be nuts.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.111
Now, wait a minute.

44:19.282 --> 44:22.866
He is old, but he's sharp.
He's not in bad health either.

44:23.035 --> 44:25.321
You know,
I don't think flagg would suspect

44:25.454 --> 44:27.740
we'd send a old fellow
like the judge.

44:27.915 --> 44:29.871
If I can't go,
what about asking dayna?

44:30.710 --> 44:32.670
Stu: Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Wait, wait, wait.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.748
I'm not being serious here.

44:34.922 --> 44:36.537
Well, you better get serious.

44:37.258 --> 44:38.668
I can't believe we're doing this.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.643
Hey, if you didn't wanna get
your hands dirty,

44:40.761 --> 44:42.592
you should've stayed off
the committee.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.175
We're probably sending people off
to get killed.

44:45.349 --> 44:46.429
Yeah, that's right.

44:46.601 --> 44:50.310
Making decisions like that
is what being in charge is all about.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.185
Either grow up and do it or get out.

44:56.527 --> 44:58.518
You're awful cute
when you get angry, St...

45:10.374 --> 45:11.955
Larry: Okay. All right.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.621
So who's the third goat?

45:16.047 --> 45:18.379
Er, scout.

45:19.175 --> 45:21.461
You got any ideas?

45:30.561 --> 45:32.176
Well, Nick here has got an idea.

45:33.189 --> 45:34.189
And it's a dilly.

45:38.819 --> 45:41.811
Glen: Ten. Nine.

45:42.782 --> 45:46.616
Eight. You're getting drowsy, Tom.

45:46.786 --> 45:48.651
Tom: Drowsy. That's right.

45:48.829 --> 45:50.740
Laws, yes.

45:50.915 --> 45:54.908
Glen: Seven, drowsier still.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.874
Soon you'll be fast asleep.

46:00.633 --> 46:05.127
Six, five, four,

46:05.304 --> 46:10.469
three, two, one.

46:11.477 --> 46:15.265
Tom: One. - Are you asleep, Tom?

46:15.856 --> 46:18.438
Yes, Tom is asleep.

46:18.609 --> 46:21.976
Rock-a-bye baby

46:30.788 --> 46:34.827
- Can you hear me, Tom?
- Yeah, I hear you, St...

46:35.376 --> 46:36.456
Stu: Nick's here with me.

46:38.045 --> 46:41.082
Fran, Larry, Ralph, sue, Glen.

46:41.215 --> 46:46.130
- They're all here with me.
- All my friends, laws, yes.

46:46.429 --> 46:51.389
Stu: We need you to do something,
Tom it's for the free zone.

46:51.976 --> 46:55.013
- It's dangerous.
Tom: It's him, isn't it?

47:02.111 --> 47:05.603
- Yeah, Tommy, it is.
Tom: The hardcase.

47:05.781 --> 47:10.275
The walkin dude.
He can call the rats

47:10.453 --> 47:14.287
he can see
all across the long miles.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.622
But he's afraid of us.

47:16.792 --> 47:19.329
Fran: Are you the same Tom
that Nick met in Oklahoma?

47:19.503 --> 47:21.414
Tom: Yes no.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.164
I'm god's Tom.

47:29.263 --> 47:33.222
We want you to go west, Tommy.
Can you do that?

47:33.392 --> 47:37.476
West. Yes, Tom knows west.

47:37.646 --> 47:39.386
That's where the sun goes down.

47:40.399 --> 47:44.563
Stu: We need you
to keep your eyes open.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.776
Wide open.

47:47.615 --> 47:50.698
We want you to look at the airfields

47:50.868 --> 47:53.735
and see if people
are getting planes ready to fly.

47:53.913 --> 47:56.575
Or maybe missiles.
Do you know what missiles are, Tom?

47:57.041 --> 47:59.828
- Rockets.
Stu: Yes, that's right.

48:00.628 --> 48:03.335
We want you to see
if people are being trained.

48:03.506 --> 48:05.792
Like soldiers? Stu: Yeah

48:05.966 --> 48:11.211
but most important,
we want you to listen.

48:12.056 --> 48:15.344
Listen to what people say about flagg.

48:15.518 --> 48:18.510
And about the free zone
here in Boulder.

48:20.064 --> 48:24.478
We need to know what flagg
means to do about the free zone.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.020
Tom: If he means to:

48:28.406 --> 48:31.364
That's right, Tom. You got it.

48:31.534 --> 48:33.991
Stu: Can you do all that, Tommy?

48:34.161 --> 48:37.153
Tom: Look, listen.

48:37.331 --> 48:38.867
Yes

48:39.500 --> 48:42.492
I'll be afraid, but I can do that.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.248
I ook.

48:45.965 --> 48:48.672
And then you come back here
to Boulder

48:48.843 --> 48:52.552
when the moon is full.
Do you understand?

48:52.721 --> 48:54.461
Tom: Yes

48:54.640 --> 48:59.350
m-o-0o-n spells moon.

49:00.729 --> 49:03.095
Come back and tell

49:03.899 --> 49:05.605
unless they catch me.

49:08.112 --> 49:12.355
If anyone asks questions
why you came, this is what you'll say:

49:13.075 --> 49:16.283
- They drove you out of the free zone.
- Drove me out.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.115
Stu:
Because you were feeble-minded.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.621
Feeble-minded, laws, yes.

49:20.791 --> 49:23.203
And you might have a woman,

49:23.586 --> 49:26.453
and that woman
might have idiot children.

49:26.630 --> 49:29.667
Idiot children, like Tom.

49:32.595 --> 49:36.133
Go ahead, finish.
Don't leave him out there.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.227
Tell it back to me, Tommy.

49:43.814 --> 49:46.226
What will you say
if they ask you questions?

49:46.400 --> 49:51.440
Tom: You drove me out because
you were afraid I might have a woman

49:51.614 --> 49:56.108
and fill her belly up
with a retard like me.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.906
Stu: When you come back here,

50:00.080 --> 50:02.822
you'll walk at night
and sleep in the day.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.457
Tom:
Walk at night. Sleep in the day.

50:05.628 --> 50:07.289
But someone might see you anyway.

50:08.506 --> 50:12.419
If it's one person that sees you,
kill him.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.676
Tommy?

50:16.222 --> 50:17.883
Tom: Kill him?

50:18.682 --> 50:21.048
If it's more than one, you run.

50:23.187 --> 50:25.929
Come back when the moon is full,

50:26.106 --> 50:28.563
not the half moon,
not the fingernail moon.

50:29.401 --> 50:32.859
Walk at night. Sleep in the day.

50:33.030 --> 50:36.022
Don't let anybody see me.

50:39.078 --> 50:41.410
Larry:
Go ahead, stu, wake him up.

50:41.580 --> 50:43.036
Please wake him up.

50:49.922 --> 50:51.253
Tom?

50:52.466 --> 50:55.583
Would you like to see an elephant?

51:00.224 --> 51:01.259
Tom: Did I do all right?

51:03.394 --> 51:05.305
I stand on my head like before?

51:05.813 --> 51:07.474
No, Tom.

51:08.941 --> 51:11.182
You did some even better tricks
this time.

51:18.826 --> 51:21.408
Chad: History teaches us that
when the great plague hits

51:21.579 --> 51:24.116
those who don't die alone
usually die in church.

51:24.290 --> 51:26.121
So we may find nothing in this one,

51:26.292 --> 51:29.580
but if we do,
try to think of the bodies as cordwood.

51:29.753 --> 51:33.041
- It'll make it easier.
- Cordwood?

53:20.280 --> 53:21.690
Nadine: Come on in.

53:22.324 --> 53:24.690
It is your house, after all. Isn't it?

53:27.913 --> 53:29.153
Who the hell are you?

53:30.040 --> 53:32.247
Well

53:34.461 --> 53:36.452
I'm Nadine cross.

53:44.263 --> 53:46.549
I saw you at the meeting
the other night,

53:46.724 --> 53:49.557
and I believe you saw me too.

53:51.770 --> 53:54.728
What are you doing in my house?
And how did you get in here?

53:56.316 --> 53:59.023
- And what's that smell?
- Supper.

53:59.486 --> 54:02.398
And the rest of the q&a
will have to wait until it's on the table.

54:02.573 --> 54:05.189
I put two jugs of wash water
on the back stoop

54:05.826 --> 54:07.407
and, frankly, you could use it.

54:07.578 --> 54:09.739
What have you been doing?

54:17.463 --> 54:20.705
Stuff I'd rather not talk about,
if it's all the same to you.

54:21.258 --> 54:22.748
Okay.

54:26.805 --> 54:29.046
Don't even think about leaving.

54:29.892 --> 54:32.008
Absolutely not.

54:59.046 --> 55:00.331
Tinned beef, I'm afraid.

55:00.464 --> 55:03.456
Hardly the choice
of French chefs, but...

55:06.261 --> 55:07.341
It was wonderful

55:08.347 --> 55:10.178
thank you.

55:12.810 --> 55:16.302
The supermarket is full of deer.
Did you know that?

55:16.480 --> 55:17.600
Now that the produce is gone

55:17.773 --> 55:20.310
they're sticking mainly
to the cereal section.

55:46.051 --> 55:47.587
Mmm.

55:54.142 --> 55:56.133
To friendship.

56:00.983 --> 56:03.975
Are we going to be friends, Nadine?

56:04.820 --> 56:06.060
Nadine: Mm.

56:07.489 --> 56:10.026
Very good friends.

56:11.159 --> 56:13.070
You're planning on going west,
aren't you?

56:14.162 --> 56:15.698
To him?

56:17.541 --> 56:19.827
What would put a crazy idea like that
in your head?

56:21.086 --> 56:24.829
Oh, I got lots of crazy ideas.

56:27.593 --> 56:29.754
Just wait and see

56:39.021 --> 56:41.512
You're a virgin, aren't you?

56:44.192 --> 56:48.026
It's all right. I am too.

56:50.198 --> 56:53.361
You? Me.

56:54.036 --> 56:55.992
And I'm gonna stay that way

56:56.163 --> 56:59.701
because it's for someone else
to change it.

57:00.918 --> 57:02.408
Who?

57:03.086 --> 57:05.202
Don't be dense, Harold.

57:05.380 --> 57:07.871
But we can still do things.

57:08.425 --> 57:11.167
Things you wouldn't believe.

57:11.345 --> 57:14.883
Everything but that one thing,
and it's such a little thing really.

57:16.350 --> 57:17.965
How would you know?

57:28.779 --> 57:33.273
Pull tab a, Harold. And shut up.

57:40.791 --> 57:42.452
To new acquaintances.

57:47.547 --> 57:49.503
And absent friends.

58:31.967 --> 58:34.083
Farris:
The disappearance of the old woman

58:34.261 --> 58:37.048
might just be for the best.

58:37.764 --> 58:40.756
People should be free
to judge for themselves

58:40.934 --> 58:43.550
what the lights in the sky are.

58:43.729 --> 58:48.098
Or if god sometimes
does speak in the thunder.

58:48.233 --> 58:50.975
You think she's dead. No.

58:51.111 --> 58:52.726
She should be.

58:52.904 --> 58:58.399
But I don't think she's done yet,
or done with us.

59:00.954 --> 59:03.616
Look, uh, judge,

59:04.332 --> 59:06.038
I wanted to talk to you.

59:06.209 --> 59:09.827
There's no need
to twist yourself into knots, Larry.

59:12.299 --> 59:14.836
I know why I'm here.

59:15.427 --> 59:16.712
And I accept.

59:17.345 --> 59:19.085
How do you know that?

59:19.806 --> 59:21.846
If someone on the committee's
leaking information...

59:21.975 --> 59:24.387
Nobody's been leaking anything.

59:24.561 --> 59:26.472
At least not to me.

59:26.813 --> 59:31.978
I merely asked myself
what my first priority would be

59:32.110 --> 59:34.066
if I were in your shoes.

59:34.529 --> 59:38.693
The answer, of course, is information.

59:38.867 --> 59:41.153
That means spies.

59:42.245 --> 59:46.158
- Well, we like to call them scouts.
- Okay.

59:46.333 --> 59:48.699
Scouts, by all means.

59:49.461 --> 59:55.707
And each of we scouts
is to be ignorant of the others.

59:55.884 --> 1:00:00.503
In case of capture or torture.

1:00:03.767 --> 1:00:07.305
If you don't think you can make it,
you just say so.

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:10.095
You're not gonna be
much good to anyone

1:00:10.232 --> 1:00:15.443
lying dead of a heart attack beside
some ranch road in new Mexico.

1:00:15.987 --> 1:00:21.857
I'll leave tomorrow
in that four-wheel drive of mine.

1:00:22.577 --> 1:00:26.365
North to Wyoming, then due west.

1:00:26.748 --> 1:00:30.536
I'll be cold. I'll be lonely.

1:00:30.669 --> 1:00:32.955
My bowels will not work properly,

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:36.372
but also, I will be clever.

1:00:37.050 --> 1:00:41.089
Yeah, I suppose you will.

1:00:56.903 --> 1:00:59.861
Did you enjoy that, Harold”?

1:01:01.158 --> 1:01:03.114
- Yes.
- Ha-ha-ha

1:01:05.078 --> 1:01:07.069
but it couldn't have done much
for you.

1:01:07.247 --> 1:01:09.112
Au contraire.

1:01:13.211 --> 1:01:15.497
You know, it looks like blood.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:18.539
Guess that's why they use it
in communion services.

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:20.791
Drink up, Harold.

1:01:26.391 --> 1:01:29.178
How did you get into my house?

1:01:29.477 --> 1:01:34.096
He told me there would be a key
under the stoop, and there was.

1:01:36.234 --> 1:01:38.395
Aren't you gonna drink your wine,
Harold?

1:01:38.820 --> 1:01:41.607
Flagg told you
how to get into my house.

1:01:41.781 --> 1:01:43.237
Nadine: Yes

1:01:43.992 --> 1:01:48.361
he also said
you have reason to hate them.

1:01:48.538 --> 1:01:50.403
All of them.

1:01:53.627 --> 1:01:56.118
It's the woman, isn't it?

1:01:56.296 --> 1:01:59.254
You loved her.

1:01:59.424 --> 1:02:02.211
But that didn't stop redman,
did it, Harold?

1:02:02.844 --> 1:02:04.960
Well, she was mine.

1:02:06.473 --> 1:02:08.429
And the committee.

1:02:08.850 --> 1:02:12.217
That old woman left me off
and she let that hick brentner on.

1:02:12.354 --> 1:02:15.721
I'm surprised she didn't
let his feeb friend on as well

1:02:16.024 --> 1:02:18.265
there's someone in the west

1:02:18.443 --> 1:02:22.311
who will never take what's yours,
Harold,

1:02:22.489 --> 1:02:25.481
and he's waiting for us.

1:02:28.328 --> 1:02:31.661
I know. I know he is.

1:02:39.005 --> 1:02:42.293
Then drink your wine.

1:03:46.239 --> 1:03:48.605
I guess this is it, Tommy.

1:03:51.202 --> 1:03:54.740
Tom? You all right?

1:03:55.248 --> 1:03:57.830
Time to go and see the elephant.

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:03.536
That's right.

1:04:28.031 --> 1:04:30.818
Travel at night. Sleep in the day.

1:04:30.992 --> 1:04:33.654
Come back when the moon is full.

1:04:33.995 --> 1:04:35.951
Tell what I saw.

1:04:37.332 --> 1:04:38.993
That's right, Tommy.

1:04:42.670 --> 1:04:45.628
Nice of Ralph
to loan you his hat, huh?

1:04:46.299 --> 1:04:48.790
He said to take good care of it,

1:04:48.968 --> 1:04:52.552
and give it back to him
when I come home.

1:04:52.806 --> 1:04:54.592
That's just what I'm gonna do.

1:05:00.271 --> 1:05:02.728
Wish you were going with me,
old pal.

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:04.685
I wouldn't be so scared.

1:05:13.326 --> 1:05:17.660
Thanks, Nick.
I always forget stuff like that.

1:05:17.956 --> 1:05:20.368
I hate being retarded.

1:05:37.642 --> 1:05:39.052
Bye.

1:05:42.272 --> 1:05:44.729
See you later, alligator.

1:05:46.192 --> 1:05:49.104
After a while, crocodile.

1:06:02.208 --> 1:06:03.539
Relax, miss goldsmith.

1:06:03.710 --> 1:06:06.167
Okay. Please call me Fran, okay?

1:06:06.337 --> 1:06:07.873
Fran

1:06:12.677 --> 1:06:14.042
oh.

1:06:16.139 --> 1:06:18.972
- Have you gained any weight?
- Oh, just 5 pounds or so.

1:06:20.143 --> 1:06:21.633
Is he gonna be all right?

1:06:21.811 --> 1:06:26.396
- He or she is going to be fine, Fran.
- Really?

1:06:27.400 --> 1:06:29.265
I wanna see you
as soon as you're dressed.

1:06:29.402 --> 1:06:31.859
Okay. Thank you.

1:06:33.114 --> 1:06:38.074
You are so lucky.
Brad and I are already trying.

1:06:39.078 --> 1:06:42.741
How lucky I am
remains to be seen, doesn't it?

1:06:44.292 --> 1:06:47.375
The flu. Who says it's gone?

1:06:47.545 --> 1:06:49.627
And who knows
if our babies are gonna be immune?

1:07:23.748 --> 1:07:27.616
Hey. You're a card, huh?

1:07:28.545 --> 1:07:31.833
Yeah, a wild card.

1:07:53.903 --> 1:07:56.360
Do it, Harold. Go for it.

1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.163
Harold, were you dreaming?

1:08:10.962 --> 1:08:13.669
They'll be having regular meetings,
won't they?

1:08:14.048 --> 1:08:15.913
I mean, they'll have to.

1:08:16.509 --> 1:08:19.592
In fact, they probably already started.
“Who?

1:08:19.721 --> 1:08:23.213
- Their committee, Nadine.
- Oh, I don't know. I guess.

1:08:25.226 --> 1:08:27.467
And there's dynamite
in the city storage shed.

1:08:27.562 --> 1:08:29.427
Tons of it.

1:08:29.897 --> 1:08:32.434
He told me. He showed me.

1:08:32.609 --> 1:08:36.318
Harold, what are you talking about?

1:08:37.655 --> 1:08:41.944
A surprise. A big, loud one.

1:08:43.703 --> 1:08:47.366
Probably not next week, but soon.

1:08:51.711 --> 1:08:56.876
Nadine, you look so tasty.

1:08:58.009 --> 1:09:00.375
So juicy.

1:09:01.929 --> 1:09:03.669
Do I?

1:09:04.140 --> 1:09:06.426
Yes

1:09:06.893 --> 1:09:08.724
come here.

1:09:35.254 --> 1:09:37.210
Barry: All runways clear.

1:09:37.882 --> 1:09:40.043
That's a good morning's work.

1:09:41.803 --> 1:09:43.759
What I'd like is a nice nap.

1:09:43.930 --> 1:09:45.716
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

1:09:45.890 --> 1:09:49.257
How come the big guy
wanted the runway cleared anyway?

1:09:49.602 --> 1:09:52.594
Do you wanna have a nice life
in Vegas, ritchie?

1:09:52.772 --> 1:09:56.139
Good working conditions,
retirement benefits?

1:09:56.651 --> 1:09:57.515
Sure.

1:09:57.610 --> 1:09:59.817
Then don't ask why flagg does things.

1:09:59.987 --> 1:10:02.478
That's the best idea. Believe me.

1:10:02.657 --> 1:10:05.774
Hey, moose. Moose.

1:10:06.077 --> 1:10:07.988
Hey, moose.

1:10:08.579 --> 1:10:09.864
Tom: Huh?

1:10:10.039 --> 1:10:11.719
Stick this cooler
in the back of the truck.

1:10:11.874 --> 1:10:13.614
Oh, sure.

1:10:15.962 --> 1:10:19.500
And get the toolkit out of the cab
and take it into the hangar office.

1:10:19.674 --> 1:10:24.213
You bet.
M-o-o-n, that spells toolkit.

1:10:24.387 --> 1:10:25.387
Barry: Oh, god.

1:10:43.614 --> 1:10:46.572
Carl:
Easy, easy. I'm on the wing.

1:10:50.663 --> 1:10:53.621
Carl: Watch it, trash.
Trashcan man: I am, Carl.

1:10:53.791 --> 1:10:55.156
It's okay, man.

1:10:59.005 --> 1:11:00.916
Carl:
Be careful, trash. That's a bomb.

1:11:05.136 --> 1:11:07.843
Stu:
We want you to look at the airfields

1:11:08.014 --> 1:11:10.847
and see if people
are getting planes ready to fly.

1:11:11.017 --> 1:11:13.224
Or maybe missiles.

1:11:13.728 --> 1:11:16.390
I told you
to put the toolbox in the office,

1:11:16.564 --> 1:11:18.805
not be in here snooping around.

1:11:18.983 --> 1:11:20.439
I just heard something...

1:11:20.568 --> 1:11:22.809
I don't wanna hear
your retarded excuses.

1:11:22.987 --> 1:11:25.353
Now, get the hell out of here.

1:11:26.282 --> 1:11:28.273
Carl:
Everything all right, Barry?

1:11:29.327 --> 1:11:31.613
Yeah, fine.

1:12:26.342 --> 1:12:27.923
Harold?

1:12:33.307 --> 1:12:34.763
Harold?

1:12:34.934 --> 1:12:36.845
Harold?

1:12:38.771 --> 1:12:40.477
Harold?

1:12:42.733 --> 1:12:44.644
What the hell are you doing?

1:12:44.819 --> 1:12:47.026
Don't screw with my disco, Nadine.

1:12:47.905 --> 1:12:50.738
Is everything all right? No.

1:12:52.368 --> 1:12:54.450
If I had dropped this,
you would be washing my guts

1:12:54.620 --> 1:12:58.283
out of your pretty white hair
for the next two weeks

1:12:58.457 --> 1:13:00.163
I'm sorry.

1:13:00.334 --> 1:13:04.043
Let me make a suggestion,
my little disco queen.

1:13:04.171 --> 1:13:06.162
Take a walk

1:13:06.465 --> 1:13:09.832
- a walk?
- Yes, a walk.

1:13:09.969 --> 1:13:13.712
Because, you see,
I have no idea how old this stuff is

1:13:13.848 --> 1:13:18.091
I do know that old dynamite
sweats pure nitroglycerine.

1:13:19.729 --> 1:13:21.640
And if you hear a very loud bang,

1:13:21.772 --> 1:13:25.731
that will probably be me going
to that great disco inferno in the sky.

1:13:26.861 --> 1:13:30.024
All right. If you're sure.

1:13:30.656 --> 1:13:34.524
Yes, buzz.
Make like a library and book.

1:14:20.122 --> 1:14:22.113
Nadine: Hello? Fran?

1:14:22.249 --> 1:14:23.534
Anyone home?

1:15:13.050 --> 1:15:16.542
Nadine? “What?

1:15:17.722 --> 1:15:19.462
We're damned.

1:15:20.725 --> 1:15:22.135
Yes

1:15:22.476 --> 1:15:24.137
I know.

1:15:47.209 --> 1:15:49.291
Larry, come on.

1:15:50.421 --> 1:15:52.286
Larry: Okay, order.

1:15:56.719 --> 1:15:59.461
Yeah, I'd like to call this meeting
to order.

1:16:30.586 --> 1:16:32.872
Grammy abagail?

1:16:33.047 --> 1:16:34.628
Oh, my god, it's her.

1:16:34.799 --> 1:16:36.084
Gina: Grammy abagail.

1:16:37.676 --> 1:16:39.416
Look. She's come back.

1:16:43.432 --> 1:16:47.300
Gina:
Grammy abagail, grammy abagail.

1:16:49.105 --> 1:16:50.561
Man: Let's go, we better go on.

1:17:10.876 --> 1:17:11.876
Harold... Nadine.

1:17:12.044 --> 1:17:14.080
- It's...
- Here.

1:17:14.463 --> 1:17:17.671
Use this. It's perfectly accurate.

1:17:18.425 --> 1:17:19.425
All right. But...

1:17:19.593 --> 1:17:24.678
Nadine, just tell me when it's 9:15.
Until then, keep your yap shut.

1:17:26.016 --> 1:17:28.803
It's going to look beautiful
from up here.

1:17:29.395 --> 1:17:32.387
Al: The law committee
held four meetings last week,

1:17:32.481 --> 1:17:33.971
and will hold two meetings this week

1:17:34.150 --> 1:17:38.610
in order to finalize the regulations
and procedures to establish...

1:17:38.779 --> 1:17:40.815
Abagail: Fran

1:17:40.990 --> 1:17:42.651
al: The meetings
are going very slowly...

1:17:42.825 --> 1:17:46.864
Abagail: Nick's house...
“What the hell?

1:17:47.496 --> 1:17:49.953
Listen, we have to get out of here.
Right now.

1:17:50.124 --> 1:17:52.490
- Ralph, what is it?
- He's right, something's wrong.

1:17:52.668 --> 1:17:54.533
It's in the closet.

1:17:55.254 --> 1:17:57.495
Abagail: The closet

1:18:00.634 --> 1:18:02.044
- Nick, Nick, don't...
- Don't

1:18:06.182 --> 1:18:08.423
out, my dear.
We gotta go, we gotta get out.

1:18:08.601 --> 1:18:10.887
Do it, Harold. Do it.

1:18:11.061 --> 1:18:13.552
This is Harold lauder.

1:18:13.731 --> 1:18:16.313
Harold:
I do this of my own free will.

1:18:16.483 --> 1:18:18.223
Ralph: Go, go!

1:18:18.402 --> 1:18:19.687
Nick, Nick! No. Don't!

1:18:37.004 --> 1:18:40.542
Frannie? Frannie?

1:18:45.387 --> 1:18:47.002
Help!

1:18:47.848 --> 1:18:49.884
Help me!

1:19:20.589 --> 1:19:22.420
Fran: Am I dead?

1:19:24.551 --> 1:19:27.258
No, child.

1:19:27.429 --> 1:19:29.169
You ain't dead

1:19:30.849 --> 1:19:32.510
then why am I here?

1:19:32.977 --> 1:19:37.971
You're here to do god's will, child.
Just like everyone else.

1:19:38.148 --> 1:19:42.687
God didn't bring you together
to make a committee or free zone.

1:19:42.820 --> 1:19:46.688
He brought you together
to send some of you further.

1:19:46.865 --> 1:19:50.323
It's Stuart who must lead
now that Nick's gone.

1:19:50.494 --> 1:19:53.361
I ead? I ead where?

1:19:53.497 --> 1:19:55.488
Abagail.:
Why, west, little girl.

1:19:56.041 --> 1:19:58.498
You're not to go. Only these four.

1:19:58.669 --> 1:20:02.662
Stuart, Ralph, Larry and Glen.
You'll buy...

1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:06.753
No, Stuart's not going. He's gonna
stay with me when I have my baby.

1:20:06.927 --> 1:20:11.011
Neither one of us is gonna have
any more to do with your killer god.

1:20:12.057 --> 1:20:17.973
The devil's imp has called
his bride to put her with child.

1:20:18.147 --> 1:20:21.810
Will he let your child live, little girl?

1:20:24.737 --> 1:20:27.979
Father, mother, wife, husband.

1:20:28.157 --> 1:20:33.151
Set against them,
the prince of high places.

1:20:34.204 --> 1:20:39.790
I have sinned in pride.
So have you all.

1:20:40.294 --> 1:20:42.410
But that's past now.

1:20:44.089 --> 1:20:50.210
It's time now to give over your will

1:20:50.387 --> 1:20:52.878
to the will of god.

1:20:53.057 --> 1:20:58.393
It's time to make your stand.

1:21:02.941 --> 1:21:04.806
Fran: No. Stu: Shh.

1:21:08.864 --> 1:21:10.525
Frannie.

1:21:11.784 --> 1:21:15.652
Frannie, wake up, honey. Wake up.

1:21:17.623 --> 1:21:21.161
- Did I lose the baby?
- No, no.

1:21:21.335 --> 1:21:23.951
- The baby's okay.
Fran: Oh, my back.

1:21:28.092 --> 1:21:30.174
Stu: Doc says it's whiplash.

1:21:30.302 --> 1:21:32.714
You won't be running the
hundred-yard dash for a few months,

1:21:32.888 --> 1:21:36.506
but I think you'll be all right to move.

1:21:36.683 --> 1:21:38.344
Try to sit up.

1:21:39.311 --> 1:21:40.642
Stu: Here come on.

1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:42.845
Fran: Ow.

1:21:46.610 --> 1:21:48.441
Nick's dead.

1:21:51.490 --> 1:21:53.026
Yeah

1:21:54.743 --> 1:21:57.405
- how did you know?
- She told me.

1:21:58.789 --> 1:22:00.199
Who else died?

1:22:00.374 --> 1:22:03.832
- No, we can talk about that later...
- No, who else?

1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:09.831
Chad Norris.

1:22:11.635 --> 1:22:13.591
Al bundell.

1:22:13.887 --> 1:22:16.128
Andrea terminello.

1:22:17.015 --> 1:22:18.880
Dick Ellis.

1:22:21.812 --> 1:22:23.768
Susan stern.

1:22:25.983 --> 1:22:29.146
Twenty or so wounded.
“Who did it?

1:22:29.319 --> 1:22:32.561
It looks like Harold lauder
and that cross woman.

1:22:32.739 --> 1:22:35.276
Where are they? Are they gone?

1:22:36.285 --> 1:22:37.900
Yeah

1:22:38.328 --> 1:22:39.488
abagail: Send them out.

1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:45.541
All but those
that are left of your committee.

1:22:48.755 --> 1:22:50.495
All right, ten minutes. No more.

1:22:51.300 --> 1:22:55.134
Come on, people. If you're not part
of the committee, out. Let's go.

1:22:55.262 --> 1:22:57.093
Abagail: Stay.

1:22:57.222 --> 1:23:00.134
This concerns you and Fran

1:23:00.851 --> 1:23:05.561
as much as these men
who have to go into the wilderness.

1:23:06.231 --> 1:23:08.768
What do you mean
"into the wilderness"?

1:23:10.903 --> 1:23:14.987
This is god's will, given me

1:23:15.157 --> 1:23:20.618
as I wandered
into my own wilderness.

1:23:20.746 --> 1:23:23.829
Draw close around me.

1:23:26.627 --> 1:23:28.333
Tell us, mother.

1:23:29.254 --> 1:23:33.497
You four men are to go west,

1:23:33.759 --> 1:23:36.250
to take no food or water,

1:23:37.387 --> 1:23:43.849
but to go this very day
in the clothes you now wear.

1:23:45.479 --> 1:23:47.390
You are to go on foot.

1:23:48.982 --> 1:23:54.443
I'm in the way of knowing,
one will fall by the way,

1:23:54.613 --> 1:23:57.855
but I don't know which it will be.

1:23:59.326 --> 1:24:02.033
And I'm in the way of knowing

1:24:02.204 --> 1:24:06.868
the others will be taken
before this flagg,

1:24:07.042 --> 1:24:13.754
who isn't a man,
but a creature from beyond the world.

1:24:14.550 --> 1:24:19.214
I don't know if you will defeat him.

1:24:19.346 --> 1:24:24.466
I only know god wants you to go.

1:24:24.643 --> 1:24:27.510
And with god's help,

1:24:27.854 --> 1:24:32.143
you will stand and be true.

1:24:32.609 --> 1:24:34.145
Fran: And what if we say no?

1:24:34.236 --> 1:24:36.022
Frannie, come on. “What?

1:24:36.738 --> 1:24:43.735
Your will is as free
as that of Eve in the garden, child.

1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:50.917
"Go where ye list"
has always been god's way.

1:24:53.088 --> 1:24:58.003
But this is what god wants of you.

1:24:59.386 --> 1:25:01.502
Be true.

1:25:02.306 --> 1:25:04.467
Stand.

1:25:25.245 --> 1:25:26.530
Glen: It is finished.

1:25:27.497 --> 1:25:31.615
White magic. That's all that's left.

1:25:41.136 --> 1:25:45.175
Fran:
Stuart, please say no. Please.

1:25:45.349 --> 1:25:48.466
Frannie,
I think if even one of us says no

1:25:50.145 --> 1:25:52.557
then maybe we all die.

1:26:05.077 --> 1:26:07.068
Lucy: Take care of yourself.

1:26:08.580 --> 1:26:12.493
I love you, you know?

1:26:25.138 --> 1:26:27.504
Swear to me that you'll come back.

1:26:28.892 --> 1:26:32.976
- Fran...
- Come on, god can't run all of it.

1:26:33.271 --> 1:26:35.557
Swear to me you'll come back.

1:26:37.526 --> 1:26:41.018
- I swear to try.
- That's not good enough.

1:26:54.876 --> 1:26:56.241
Thanks.
