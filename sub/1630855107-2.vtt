No...

00:55.764 --> 00:56.765
Fuck.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.562
Where are you?

01:03.605 --> 01:05.899
Where have they gone? [grunts]

01:05.899 --> 01:07.692
[agitated hollering]

01:07.692 --> 01:10.445
[wailing]

01:11.029 --> 01:12.363

Humanity first! Humanity first!

01:53.404 --> 01:54.906
- I'm tired.
- [chanting stops]

01:54.906 --> 01:58.284
I don't know about y'all,
but I'm tired of waiting for answers.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.786
[throng] Yeah!

01:59.786 --> 02:01.913
We've all done
what we've had to to survive,

02:01.913 --> 02:04.749
but I'm tired of fending for myself.

02:04.749 --> 02:08.753
I'm tired of feeling like I got a target
on my back just for being human.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.046
[throng] Yeah!

02:10.046 --> 02:12.882
It's a confusing world
out there right now,

02:12.882 --> 02:15.510
but I'll be damned
if the Last Men don't bring

02:15.510 --> 02:17.220
a little order to the chaos.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.388
Yeah!

02:18.388 --> 02:20.473
[throng whooping, hollering]

02:21.307 --> 02:23.977
Join us! Save humanity!

02:23.977 --> 02:25.061

[whooping and hollering continue]

02:34.445 --> 02:35.446
[Jepp] Coach.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.326
Of course you made it.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.955
Great Crumble don't stand a chance
against number 93.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.665
Huh.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.000
[clears throat]

02:48.126 --> 02:49.127
How about Louisa?

02:51.629 --> 02:52.630
I lost her.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.968
Her and the baby, our... son.

02:57.552 --> 03:01.806
I looked everywhere for them.
The QZs, the camps, the registries.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.558
I don't know where else to look.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.561
Is it true what you said in there?

03:06.561 --> 03:08.855
[fraught, distressing music playing]

03:08.855 --> 03:09.856
Which part?

03:10.356 --> 03:11.983
About getting answers.

03:22.827 --> 03:26.289
This... will get you in a lot of doors.

03:26.289 --> 03:30.168
Doors that locked you out because you're
a nobody in this new world, like I was.

03:31.836 --> 03:32.962
With the Last Men,

03:34.547 --> 03:36.049
you can be somebody again.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.344
<i>You can take back some of what's yours.</i>

03:39.344 --> 03:41.262
I only want my family.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.889
Listen to me, T.

03:43.681 --> 03:47.018
If they're out there,
Last Men are gonna find them.

You with us? You with us?

03:56.986 --> 03:58.905
[chanting continues] Humanity first!

04:03.326 --> 04:04.327
[Gus] <i>Big Man?</i>

- [gasps]

04:07.997 --> 04:10.708
Where is he? Where is... [shuddering breath]

04:11.751 --> 04:14.170
[Jepp breathing shakily, spluttering]

04:14.921 --> 04:17.924
You're okay.
You're just having a panic attack.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.176
Slow your breathing.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.177
[gulping gasp]

04:21.678 --> 04:23.263
Count to ten.

04:23.972 --> 04:24.973
One.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.225
[inhales deeply] Two.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.353
[haltingly] How'd you find me?

04:31.354 --> 04:32.188
Three.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.023
- I heard your kid on the radio.
- Four.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.943
But by the time I got there,
he was already taken to the Preserve.

04:36.943 --> 04:37.860
[Jepp] Five.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.445
[breath evening out]

04:40.321 --> 04:41.322
Six.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.700
- Then I saw you.
- Seven.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.744
Figured if the Last Men shot you,
you must be on my side.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.330
Did you see anyone else?

04:50.039 --> 04:53.918
A girl, curly hair, punk attitude.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.461
She was at this house in GoGro.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.882
They said over the radio
they found a safe house in the area.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.635
Maybe it was
the same one your friend was in.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.723
I guess it burned down,
then I lost contact.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.434
I'm sorry.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.727
No.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.855
If she's smart, she'll be long gone.

05:16.691 --> 05:17.525
I'm Aimee.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.818
Where's my jacket?

05:18.818 --> 05:20.111
I left it there.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.863
I liked that jacket.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.990
- You're welcome.
- For leaving it there?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.616
For saving your life.

05:33.124 --> 05:37.420
You're that Preserve lady
who took in all those hybrids.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.048
And you're on all those wanted posters.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.925
Good. Heart rate's steadied.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.844
Now we can start.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.429
Start what?

05:47.305 --> 05:48.639
Oh shit.

05:48.639 --> 05:49.932
Here's the plan.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.518
Our kids are here at the Preserve.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.645
At midnight,
I'll come in through the front.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.564
[Jepp chuckling wryly]

05:56.564 --> 05:57.482
Good luck.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.067
This bitch is crazy.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.612
[grunting] God.

06:05.907 --> 06:06.824
You're leaving?

06:06.824 --> 06:08.868
That place will be a fortress.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.456
If I'm gonna get that kid back,
I'm gonna do it my way.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.417
Or we can do it together
and get all the kids back.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.294
It's a lot easier to save one.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.546
I know that place better than anyone.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.841
Give me one chance.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.468
You owe me at least that.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.437
I'll go in, find where they're keeping
the kids, and we'll get out here.

06:36.437 --> 06:40.149
It's an old tunnel blocked off years ago.
It leads right under the zoo.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.692
They probably sealed it off.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.653
They don't even know it exists.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.364
It leads to an exit on Crosby.

06:47.198 --> 06:51.244
When I give the signal over the radio,
you'll take my truck and meet us there.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.037
It's a good plan.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.164
It's not a good plan.

06:55.748 --> 06:56.916
[Wendy] <i>Mom, we're alive.</i>

06:56.916 --> 06:59.544
<i>We're in the pump house
under the elephant pen.</i>

06:59.544 --> 07:01.170
<i>They took Roy.</i>

07:02.171 --> 07:05.550
You answer that and you'll ruin
your only advantage. Surprise.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.599
[determined music playing]

07:14.267 --> 07:16.477
- What the hell are you doing?
- Roy was taken.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.521
I have to get in there.

07:20.356 --> 07:21.566
What happened to midnight?

07:21.566 --> 07:24.110
You said our one advantage is surprise.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.404
No one expects me
to go in the front in broad daylight.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.031
Wait for my signal.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.616
I didn't say I was helping.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.034
Gus is waiting for you.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.120
I didn't say his name.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.538
You talk in your sleep.

07:40.710 --> 07:41.544
Damn.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.631
[wistful, nostalgic music playing]

07:53.514 --> 07:56.017
[determined music swells]

- [Last Man 1] Need a hand over here!

08:11.324 --> 08:13.868
- [Last Man 2] Got a double load!
- [Last Man 1] Double load!

08:35.223 --> 08:36.557
[guard 1] Hold on, let me check.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.684
[scanning devices beeping]

08:38.684 --> 08:39.727

[scanner beeps]

08:55.535 --> 08:56.619
Hand.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.247
- Hand!
- [clears throat]

09:04.627 --> 09:06.128
I need to do a blood test.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.054

09:15.054 --> 09:17.056
[computer beeping]

09:26.190 --> 09:27.733
[music swells, trails off]

09:28.818 --> 09:29.652
You're good.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.533
[heavy, oppressive music playing]

09:36.158 --> 09:37.702

[Last Men chattering indistinctly]

09:51.966 --> 09:53.968

10:06.063 --> 10:07.857
[Last Man over radio] <i>All units...</i>

10:10.693 --> 10:12.069
- [Last Man grunts]
- [basket rattles]

10:23.414 --> 10:26.459
- [Johnny] What do you need flowers for?
- [Dr. Singh] It's a need-to-know basis.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.961
[Johnny] I want to help you
while I'm in charge, Doc,

10:28.961 --> 10:31.756
but if things aren't to his liking
when he gets back,

10:31.756 --> 10:32.923
we're both gonna get hell.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.676
Everything will be to his liking
before he returns, Johnny.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.763
[Johnny] I hope so, for your sake.

You new?

10:53.235 --> 10:55.071
[hesitantly] I just got assigned.

10:55.071 --> 10:55.988
Hybrid duty.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.450
Then what are you doing
with the Choc-o-Rockets?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.287
Figured we could use a snack.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.164
Want one?

11:06.582 --> 11:08.084
Which base did you train out of?

11:09.835 --> 11:10.836
What's it to you?

They're looking for us
over at the elephant pen.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.554
She's with me.

Hang on. I'm gonna need to see your IDs.

I'm not.

11:48.165 --> 11:51.794
I'm trying to stop you from messing up
my one shot at breaking out Gus.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.171
Let's go break him out.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.382
Damn right.

Hold it.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.427
[tense stinger]

12:01.595 --> 12:03.639
I took out a defector yesterday.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.434
Had a little hybrid with him.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.395
You know anything about that?

12:10.479 --> 12:12.189
Sure do. Yeah.

- Hey. We gotta get out.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.681
No. We have to get the kids.

12:45.681 --> 12:48.100
We get caught and no one gets their kids.

I didn't expect you
to be here for this part.

- Roger that.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.957
And someone close up the goddamn tunnel!

13:54.625 --> 13:55.626
[loud bang]

14:00.339 --> 14:01.841
[Last Man] <i>Alpha Unit, hit the streets.</i>

14:02.633 --> 14:05.094
<i>Take the south gate.
We'll head east and west.</i>

14:05.094 --> 14:06.720
<i>Fire up the drone!</i>

14:12.893 --> 14:15.020
Lunchtime, freaks.

[gentle, optimistic music playing]

14:33.831 --> 14:35.875
Dog? How did you get in here?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.378
Big Man! That means he's alive.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.214
Told ya! We're getting out of here!

14:42.214 --> 14:44.049
[excited, restrained chatter]

14:44.049 --> 14:45.134
Listen up.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.681
We need to be ready to move
when they get here.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.182
We can meet Roy!

14:52.182 --> 14:54.643
- [kid] Roy! Meet Roy.
- [kids muttering excitedly]

15:01.191 --> 15:02.359
They will come.

15:02.359 --> 15:05.446
For all of us.
As long as we stay together.

15:06.030 --> 15:06.864
Believe it.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.032
Where are we gonna go?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.492
Maybe the place where Gus grew up.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.161
No, thanks.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.787
I thought it was your home.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.664
I thought so too, but...

15:19.335 --> 15:20.836
I don't need to go back there.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.756
[Bobby, haltingly] Bobby can't.

15:24.798 --> 15:25.883
Collar.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.176
Good point, Bobby.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.720
We have to get that off before Mom comes.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.400
[unsettling music playing]

15:49.698 --> 15:52.117
[restrained sobbing]

16:13.555 --> 16:15.015
What happened to you, Gus?

16:38.539 --> 16:39.540
[Rani] Up here?

16:50.509 --> 16:51.844
[Dr. Singh] Our new room.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.761
[Rani] Hmm.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.349
I bargained with Johnny
for a change of scenery.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.228
I needed the aviary for work.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.904
I feel alive again.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.241
Thank you.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.453
Uh, I'd say make the place your own,

17:17.453 --> 17:22.458
but I, uh, can't seem to find
a Target around here that's still open.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.793
[chuckles] You're in a good mood.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.464
Does this mean work is going well?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.633
Yeah. I might be onto something big.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.597
Maybe even a breakthrough about where
the hybrids came from in the first place.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.848
Wow, how did you, um--

17:37.848 --> 17:39.099
This, um...

17:40.893 --> 17:43.896
There's this deer boy, Rani.
There's something about him.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.357
I think his father made him.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.945
Have you been getting enough sleep?

17:53.739 --> 17:58.285
Every minute I'm asleep is another minute
I'm not finding our way out of here.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.369
Hey.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.331
I'm worried about you, Adi.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.461
Maybe you can get
a good night's sleep tonight,

18:07.461 --> 18:09.546
in this bed, with me.

Everything all right?

18:14.802 --> 18:17.554
Yeah, just the nut job
that used to live here. Don't worry.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.015
Someone lived here?

18:22.559 --> 18:24.436
Message for you, Doc.
The florist has arrived.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.650
Adi?

18:30.150 --> 18:31.068
I have to work.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.910
You think I don't know that look?

19:23.745 --> 19:25.664
I grew up with an older brother.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.915
Yeah.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.711
You guys are hiding something.

Hands! Flippers.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.800
Where I can see 'em.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.855
This day just gets better and better.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.527
You. Deer kid. With me.

Singh wants you.

[Johnny] I put my neck on the line for you
'cause you promised results.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.236
I hope you know what you're doing.
These flowers can kill us.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.072
[Dr. Sing] No one's found a cure
in a decade, Johnny.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.200
If I'm going to find one,
I have to take some chances.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.118
[Johnny] You got ten minutes. That's it.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.789
You better hope this works, Doc.

21:12.562 --> 21:13.563
Uh-huh.

21:15.857 --> 21:19.236
I want to try
something different this time, Gus.

21:19.987 --> 21:24.574
<i>You told me how you got to see your Pubba
after falling in the purple flowers, so I...</i>

21:25.575 --> 21:27.786
<i>I brought the purple flowers to you.</i>

21:28.412 --> 21:32.374
The pollen seems to have
a hallucinogenic effect on your kind.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.711
Sort of like, uh, hypnosis.

21:36.295 --> 21:40.299

remember where you came from.</i>

21:40.299 --> 21:41.967

21:45.178 --> 21:48.432
If this doesn't work, I'll have to go back
to taking your friends.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.479
Okay, Gus.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.648
Let's get started.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.247
[uneasy audio distortions]

22:55.123 --> 22:56.500
I don't want to be here!

22:57.167 --> 22:58.919
Hey, hey, don't worry. Don't worry.

22:59.419 --> 23:00.837
I'm right here with you.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.384
Now, Gus, it's important you tell me

23:06.134 --> 23:07.761
everything you're seeing

23:08.345 --> 23:10.472
if you want to go back to your friends.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.724
What are you looking at

23:14.267 --> 23:15.352
right now?

23:15.352 --> 23:17.270
[Dr. Singh echoing]

23:17.270 --> 23:20.273
[Gus] The fence
that Pubba told me never to cross.

23:20.857 --> 23:23.110
<i>Except I'm on the other side of it.</i>

23:23.860 --> 23:24.986
Come on, Gus.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.531
We'll cross the fence together.

23:28.949 --> 23:29.950
Let's go.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.160
[ominous music builds, fades away]

23:32.828 --> 23:35.330
[Jepp] You know how to get
to the nearest city exit?

23:35.330 --> 23:36.415
No.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.875
We can ride this out in my office.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.628
You don't get it.
We need to leave the city now,

23:41.628 --> 23:43.547
find some muscle, then come back.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.048
I just left my kids.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.092
I am not leaving the city too.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.761
Well, you can do whatever you want.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.056
I'm getting the hell out of here. [grunts]

23:54.433 --> 23:55.559
[Aimee] Wait, Jepperd.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.352
What... What about Gus?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.398
Dog is a promise.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.942
You can bet your ass I'm gonna keep It.

24:05.110 --> 24:05.944
[Aimee] Fine.

24:06.862 --> 24:07.988
But you need me.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.243
And the only way
we're getting out is my truck.

24:16.329 --> 24:17.205
[Jepp] Damn it!

24:17.956 --> 24:19.458
[angrily] Come on, then.

24:23.670 --> 24:24.880
[engine splutters]

24:25.464 --> 24:26.465
[softly] Shit.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.634
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.554
Don't tell me this was the plan,
to use a broken truck.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.515
Shut up! And let me think.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.601
[engine continues spluttering]

Beans on toast.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.028
[Johnny chuckles]

24:48.528 --> 24:49.571
Because you're British.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.283
[Rani] Ah.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.702
So, you're the cook around here.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.662
I take care of all the prisoners.

24:59.372 --> 25:02.459
Kind of in charge
of this whole place until Dougie--

25:02.459 --> 25:04.294
Abbot... [clears throat] ...gets back.

25:05.712 --> 25:06.630
Impressive.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.052
And the food's plated beautifully.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.638
I used to be a chef.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.015
Thank you.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.811
W... Was this place someone's home?

25:21.811 --> 25:25.190
Some lady ran
some sort of a hybrid sanctuary.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.651
Just let them run around free.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.027
Like pets.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.447
But don't worry,
they're all in the kennels now.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.783
Hybrids lived here?

25:34.783 --> 25:35.909
Crazy, right?

25:35.909 --> 25:39.371
I even heard one of them can talk.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.335
I didn't know they were capable.

25:45.919 --> 25:49.881
Yeah, there's a lot of misconceptions
out there about the hybrids and the Sick.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.008
I mean, like you.

25:52.008 --> 25:54.636
I mean, everyone is scared of you.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.389
But I know you're not contagious.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.268
I've never even seen one before.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.187
[brooding music continues]

26:05.188 --> 26:07.857
I'm sure you could
accompany me to the kennels, right?

26:09.150 --> 26:10.652
God, I don't know, Mrs. Singh.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.987
That's not really--

26:11.987 --> 26:14.072
I thought you said you were in charge.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.745
[deep, resonant audio distortion]

[Dr. Singh] <i>Where are you, Gus?</i>

26:29.629 --> 26:30.630
It's cold...

26:33.008 --> 26:34.759
and the trees are gone.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.804
[Dr. Singh] <i>Focus, Gus.</i>

26:39.097 --> 26:40.557
We're running out of time.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.309
<i>You need to go home.</i>

26:42.309 --> 26:43.226
I don't want to.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.813
Don't you want to see your Pubba?

26:46.813 --> 26:48.898

26:48.898 --> 26:50.817
<i>Did this Pubba hurt you?</i>

26:50.817 --> 26:51.901
No.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.530
He just lied to me about some things,
and that hurt.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.574
Was he a scientist, like me?

26:58.158 --> 26:59.284
He was nothing like you.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.369
Then show me, Gus.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.663
<i>You need to help me. Do it.</i>

The cabin.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.515
A cabin. Not a laboratory?

27:23.099 --> 27:24.100
No.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.227
It's the cabin.

27:26.853 --> 27:27.854
Pubba's cabin.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.986
I'm going back. My friends need me
and we have to stay together.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.196
[forcefully] No!

27:36.196 --> 27:38.073
I'm sorry, Gus. I...

27:39.824 --> 27:41.993
I lied to you as well, I'm afraid.

27:42.869 --> 27:47.874
I told you that you were helping someone
that I care about very, very much.

27:47.874 --> 27:51.711
But do you know the real reason
why I need answers, Gus?

27:54.339 --> 27:55.965
Because I'm a prisoner too.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.259
Just like you.

28:00.428 --> 28:05.183
My life is threatened every moment
I don't have the answers, but I...

28:07.310 --> 28:09.688
But I think we can help each other, Gus.

28:11.940 --> 28:12.941
Will you help me?

28:16.528 --> 28:17.445
Okay.

Okay.
