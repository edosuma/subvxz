This is awesome.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.554
Thank you. lt didn't
even take that long.

00:13.638 --> 00:16.348
What's the difference
between a chimichanga,

00:16.433 --> 00:19.101
a chalupa and a tostada?

00:19.352 --> 00:24.273
CaII me back ASAP.
It's urgent.

Wait, this isn't funny.

No. l won't say it.

Yeah, me, too.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.303

this is inappropriate.

This is my favorite day.

lt's Secretary's Day.

And it is Erin's

so perfect storm
for a romantic gesture.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.172
Want to make sure
the whoIe office remembers
it's Secretary's Day.

01:30.256 --> 01:34.134

a text blast, a good
oId-fashioned taIk bIast.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.428
I sent a snaiI-maiI

at 7:00 this morning,

and appreciate

Oh. You couldn't

02:16.553 --> 02:20.097
l literally did not
know that existed
until this moment.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.892
Well, l knew it existed,
and l chose to let it die.

lt's nice to see
you again, Dwight.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.312
Hello, Pam.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.149
l was just wondering
what you had planned
for Secretary's Day.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.984
l'm going to give Erin $1 5.

02:32.068 --> 02:36.697
l know that Erin would be
so psyched if you
took her out to lunch.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.282
A one-on-one
lunch with Erin?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.742
Yeah. She really
looks up to you.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.162
There's only so
much we can do
as her coworkers.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.832
Secretary's Day
is really kind of a
boss-secretary thing.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.796
She's kind of a rube.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.047
That's my girlfriend
you're talking about.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.551
Okay. All right. All right.
Okay, l'll take her to lunch.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.428
She's gonna be so psyched.

Hi, Erin.
Happy Secretary's Day.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.390
Well, happy boss's day.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.517
There wouldn't be a secretary
if there was no boss.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.519
l wanted to know
what your plans
for lunch were,

03:07.604 --> 03:11.607
because l was hoping
to ask you to lunch.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.776
l got a picture of you
asking me to lunch.

03:15.111 --> 03:18.530
l was thinking
we could go to Hayworth's,
just the two of us.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.490
(GROANlNG) Well,
Hayworth's is more
business-casual,

03:20.575 --> 03:22.868
and they always
screw up your order,
so l'm. . .

03:22.952 --> 03:26.288
Oh. Yeah, okay.
Yeah, that was
a stupid suggestion.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.166
l was thinking someplace
special, so l thought
Hayworth's, but. . .

03:29.250 --> 03:30.542
Okay, well,
we'll figure
something out.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.294
Okay.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.173
Okay, let's go
to Hayworth's.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.424
Okay!

03:38.343 --> 03:40.010
Have a cookie, Kev.

03:40.094 --> 03:43.513
Yeah, ha, ha, tray of cookies.
l'm not falling for that.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.225
l brought those in.
lt's my birthday.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.477
That's some stone-cold
narcissism right there.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.479

and a very special
shout-out to the chair of
the party planning committee,

10:35.259 --> 10:38.303
Miss Angela Martin.
You have outdone yourself.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.846
Yeah, you know what?

10:39.930 --> 10:43.350
l think we can all
agree that Angela's
not so great, so. . .

10:43.434 --> 10:46.144
l'm saying the exact opposite.
Angela is fantastic.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.729
No, no, no.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.147
ANDY: Specific shout-out.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.523
Stop talking.

10:50.608 --> 10:56.196
Okay. As some of you may
know, l have a very special
connection to Secretary's Day

10:56.280 --> 11:01.368
in the form of that 1 1 5-pound
moonbeam over there
named Erin Hannon.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.871
To a lot of you she may just
be the person who brings
you your fax confirmations,

11:04.955 --> 11:07.916
but to me,
she is my girlfriend,

11:08.626 --> 11:12.337
in addition to being
the person who brings me
my fax confirmations.

11:12.421 --> 11:16.424
So, l wrote
a little ditty

11:17.593 --> 11:20.887
that l would like to play
for all of you right now.

11:20.971 --> 11:26.434
lt's a little tune called
Secretary of Love.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.771
One, two, one, two, three. . .

11:29.855 --> 11:31.106
(ALL GASPlNG)

11:31.190 --> 11:32.565
l know about Angela.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.025
l know that you
were engaged to her

11:34.110 --> 11:35.193
and that you were
sleeping with her.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.278
Michael told me.
Oh, God.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.698
Erin, can we talk
about this in private?

11:39.782 --> 11:43.451
l don't want it
to be in private.
ls it true or is it not?

11:46.205 --> 11:48.039
Yes.
Who else did
you sleep with?

11:48.124 --> 11:52.627
Did you sleep with
Phyllis or Kelly or Pam?
Maybe all together?

11:52.712 --> 11:53.712
PAM: No. No. No. No.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.880
Did everyone know?
Was l the only one
who didn't know?

11:55.965 --> 11:57.006
Yeah. Pretty much.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.133
KEVlN: Pretty much.
Yeah.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.053
Who are you?
l don't know you.
Get away!

12:06.726 --> 12:08.226
l should probably
get involved in this,

12:08.310 --> 12:12.564
but l think my energy
is better spent on
the Cookie Monster issue.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.485
Erin, you know,
if l had been engaged
to anybody before you,

12:17.570 --> 12:19.446
l would have told you.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.322
Thanks.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.492
So if you need anything,
l'm right over there.

12:25.536 --> 12:31.583
(MlMlCKlNG KEVlN) "Hey, Erin,
you look delicious!
l mean, beautiful."

12:32.460 --> 12:35.795
Okay. Okay.
There, l heard that.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.506
So, l'm sorry, Pam,
but that's it.

12:38.883 --> 12:42.510
l'm going to have
to suspend you without
pay for two days.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.929
What?
What do you mean,
suspend me?

12:45.014 --> 12:46.431
l think you need
to go a little easy.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.849
You can't just suspend
someone from work.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.728
Yeah, you're right.
You know what?
You're suspended too, Jim.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.649
Okay.
Fine. You too, Dwight.

12:56.734 --> 13:00.111
Wait, what? l was just
slow-clapping your no-nonsense
decision-making.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.697
l don't want to hear it.
Suspended.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.494
"C" is for suspension.

13:10.206 --> 13:14.417
Why would that be something
that you would talk about
on Secretary's Day?

13:14.502 --> 13:17.796
Andy, she's not the easiest
person in the world to have
a conversation with.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.299
All right? And besides,
who doesn't tell
their girlfriend

13:21.383 --> 13:24.803
that they were engaged
to someone who works
four feet away from them?

13:24.887 --> 13:28.264
That's like. . . That's. . .
That's like
Mr. & Mrs. Smith crap.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.809
l was gonna tell her,
just on my own time.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.270
You know what?
l resent the implication that
l would keep that secret.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.899
Everyone here knows
that l can't and won't
keep a secret.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.944
ANDY: Who cares?

13:41.237 --> 13:46.115
l mean, it's not like
l killed somebody.
Big deal, right?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.076
This is gonna blow
over in two seconds.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.578
She never asked me,
so if you think about it,
it's kind of. . .

13:50.663 --> 13:54.457
l probably should have
told her, l guess.
Everybody does stupid things.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.877
Psst.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.004
Hey. Erin.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.842
You want to talk to me,
come to my desk.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.020
You embarrassed me earlier.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.189
Take it up with
the chief of police.

14:18.274 --> 14:22.569
You think l want people
remembering l had
sensual relations with Andy?

14:22.653 --> 14:24.404
lt's the kind of thing
you wish you could
have annulled.

14:24.488 --> 14:28.700
l want to throw up
just thinking about it.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.202
You are throwing up
for the wrong reasons.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.913
l don't think this
fax is going through.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.124
Oh. . .

14:36.208 --> 14:40.420
ls there a different. . .
l guess put it through
again, you know?

14:48.470 --> 14:49.554
Hey.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.142
You know,
l was engaged before Jim.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.270
Really?

14:57.354 --> 14:59.188
Yeah. And he
worked here, too.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.275
lt was Andy,
wasn't it?

15:02.359 --> 15:04.611
No, no,
it wasn't Andy.
lt wasn't.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.363
lt doesn't matter.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.075
lt's not about
who you've been with.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.619
lt's about who
you end up with.

15:14.163 --> 15:18.791
Sometimes the heart
doesn't know what it wants
until it finds what it wants.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.634
l hope you find what
you're looking for.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.388
Thank you.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.362
So l can reprimand them,
but l can't suspend them?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.950
Oh, l can't do either?
Uh-huh.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.076
Fair enough.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.202
(PHONE RlNGlNG)

15:54.286 --> 15:55.954
Hey, Toby.
TOBY: I called Tallahassee.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.540
Now, he can ask you not
to come in, but he can't
dock your pay. It's not legal.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.833
Very interesting.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.336
I aIso Iearned some
interesting things about
how they structure their...

16:03.420 --> 16:05.296
Thanks, Toby.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.048
GABE: Hey, everyone. Hi.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.510
Quite an afternoon, huh?

16:10.594 --> 16:13.763
Cathartic, in a way.
l'm glad that l got
to share it with you.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.557
Makes you think about
what's really important.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.353
lt's not about showing
you're in charge or flexing
some sort of authority.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.313
lt's about forgiveness.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.483
And, yes,
l'm talking about you three
in this desk clump right here.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.360
l think that if you
were to apologize to me,

16:27.444 --> 16:29.696
then l would revoke
your suspension.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.906
l don't think
an apology is enough.

16:31.991 --> 16:36.744
l really think the only way
for me to learn my lesson
is to take my suspension.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.664
And l gotta take
this bad attitude

16:39.748 --> 16:41.791
and l gotta go home
and l got to adjust it.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.668
DWlGHT: Oh, come on.
l hope the suspension
does that.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.336
PAM: Yeah.
Prideful idiots.

16:45.421 --> 16:49.799
Watch how it's done.
Gabriel, l apologize.

16:50.718 --> 16:51.884
Great.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.929
l kneel before you.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.474
Guys, l would even
take a contrite look
as an apology.

16:58.559 --> 17:02.103
Humbly taking your hand
upon which l kiss
to show my contrition.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.983
Guys, to. . .
To err is human.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.074

important thing to me.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.743
ls your name
Andy Bernard?

17:16.827 --> 17:18.745
What's your real name?
Lionel Frankenstein?

17:18.829 --> 17:21.164
Will you stop walking
for one second?

17:21.248 --> 17:23.708
That's it. There's no
other secrets, okay?

17:24.752 --> 17:28.421
l mean, yeah,
my chest is not
naturally hairless,

17:28.505 --> 17:30.465
and my parents pay
my credit card bill.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.884
How long were
you guys together?

17:32.968 --> 17:34.135
A year.

A year?

You were together
for a year?

Yeah. But that's it.
Now you know
everything about me.

And if l think of
anything else. . .

l think l have
to be on my own
for a little bit.

17:51.487 --> 17:56.657
Like that girl Precious
in Precious, Based on the
Novel Push by Sapphire. Okay?

17:57.743 --> 17:59.702
l didn't see that movie.

had to see that.

Well, do they
still get paid?

18:07.961 --> 18:10.046
lt's tacky to
discuss finances.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.964
lt's best to pretend
that this never happened.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.758
Sounds like they just got
to go home with pay.

Pathetic.
