[ Frank Laughing ]
These things are hilarious.

00:04.171 --> 00:07.272
[ Charlie ] These are priceless.
[ Dee ]
What are you guys lookin' at?

00:07.274 --> 00:10.275
Uh, Garbage Pail Kids.
Heavin' Steven.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.211
Classic.
Totally classic.
I love Heavin' Steven.

00:12.213 --> 00:15.581
Are those those stupid cards
where babies are doing
disgusting things?

00:15.583 --> 00:20.452
Uh, no. They're the amazing
cards where babies are
doing hysterical things.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.488
You got quite
a collection
there, buddy.

00:22.490 --> 00:26.325
Yes, I do.
Hey, Charlie, how about
givin' me a couple of these?

00:26.327 --> 00:28.260
Uh, no.
[ Chuckles ]
I tell you what.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.629
I'll buy 'em from you.
You got a ton of 'em.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.264
No. These are, like,
an investment.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.267
This is my future here,
so don't mess with them.
[ Door Opens ]

00:35.269 --> 00:36.735
Hey, have you guys
seen this?

00:36.737 --> 00:40.072
We are getting
blasted in the ass
by the state liquor tax.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.340
"Blasted in the ass"?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.642
Mac, we have this
same conversation
every year.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.244
There's nothing you can do
about taxes.

00:45.246 --> 00:48.447
You guys might want
to think about voting
every once in a while.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.417
What has voting ever done?
Why-- Since wh--
What has--

00:51.419 --> 00:54.353
- Why are you comin' down--
Voting?
- Who am I supposed to vote for?

00:54.355 --> 00:57.556
Am I supposed to vote for
the Democrat who's gonna
blast me in the ass...

00:57.558 --> 00:59.691
or the Republican
who's blasting my ass?

00:59.693 --> 01:00.859
Politics is just
one big ass blast.

01:00.861 --> 01:04.530
It is a coast-to-coast,
nationwide ass blast.
You're gonna get your ass--

01:04.532 --> 01:05.597
No more! You guys
are such morons.

01:05.599 --> 01:09.635
If you knew anything at all
about politics, you would know
that that is not true.

01:09.637 --> 01:12.738
Deandra, it's just some jerk
gettin' into office...

01:12.740 --> 01:14.373
so he can get out
for the payday.

01:14.375 --> 01:18.544
Right. The guy's runnin'
for office. He's-- What?
What payday?

01:18.546 --> 01:19.878
I see it every year.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.849
Some clown runs for office,
drops out of the race...

01:23.851 --> 01:25.584
and gets
a big chunk of dough.

01:25.586 --> 01:31.523
I mean, you have to be a real
low-life piece of shit...

01:31.525 --> 01:34.226
to get involved in politics.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.398
Okay. I just got off the phone
with the city clerk.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.833
Turns out
there's an election comin' up.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.503
Local, small-time shit.
Anybody can run.
What's the position?

02:17.505 --> 02:20.606
"South Philly, Zone 2,
District 37 Comptroller.

02:20.608 --> 02:24.543
Nice. what's a comptroller?
Who gives a shit?
We're doin' it for the bribe.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.444
I nominate Dennis.

02:25.446 --> 02:29.314
- I accept your nomination.
- Wait a minute. How come
he gets to be the candidate?

02:29.316 --> 02:31.650
Take a look at that hair--
Kennedy hair.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.986
Note the bone structure.
It's like a young J.F.K.

02:33.988 --> 02:38.390
- I got the same bone structure.
- [ Others Hemming and Hawing ]

02:38.392 --> 02:40.526
What are you making that noise--
What is that about?

02:40.528 --> 02:43.996
You got something funky
goin' on in the forehead area.
Five head.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.031
Did you say five head?
I don't have that.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.801
Deandra, a woman in politics
is like a donkey doing calculus.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.571
Come on. There are plenty
of amazing women politicians.

02:52.573 --> 02:56.341
- Name one.
- Uh, Senator
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.710
- Awful.
- How is she awful?

02:58.712 --> 03:00.412
- Hates freedom.
- Uh--

03:00.414 --> 03:03.549
Okay, Dennis, you are gonna
need a campaign manager.
That's me.

03:03.551 --> 03:06.351
So--
Ooh. We should
put that one to a vote.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.020
'Cause I'd be
a good campaign manager.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.855
It's too late. I already
have the clipboard.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.759
So you can be
my assistant.
Mmm. Assistant is--

03:13.761 --> 03:16.028
- Should I wear a blazer?
- Yes.
- No.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.030
- Yes.
- No.
- I like what he said.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.032
Charlie? Campaign manager.
You don't need a blazer.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.767
A blazer's
gonna look--
I like where he's goin'.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.870
- What am I gonna do?
- [ Sighs ]
You get to be the intern.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.838
Yeah, the intern.
What does an intern do?

03:26.840 --> 03:29.608
Cut limes.
Stock glasses.
Serve drinks.

[ All Chattering ]
No. No. Come on.
You guys, damn you!

03:32.780 --> 03:34.313
I'm not doing that.
Hold it! Hold it!

03:34.315 --> 03:38.083
If my son is gonna
solicit a bribe, he's
gonna do it the right way.

03:38.085 --> 03:41.587
- I'm gonna be
campaign manager.
- Like hell you are.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.855
You are way too old.
Politics is a young man's
game.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.692
Mac, I think you might be
in over your head here.
Yeah.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.493
- Over my head?
- Yeah. Listen.

03:48.495 --> 03:53.065
Everybody who's
in favor of firing Mac
as campaign manager,

For God sakes!

You're out.

So that's it? I'm fired?
This is bullshit!

This is wonderful.
This is just wonderful.
You know what?

I'm walkin' outta here.
I don't need this shit.

04:08.015 --> 04:11.083

of the whole situation.
Show you, bitches.

Can I grab that clipboard?
No. That's mine.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.394
Yeah. It's too small.
Nah. It's perfect.

How's the bar?
Full of hoboes, Dennis.
A lot of hoboes.

Watch your ears.
There you go.
Frank.

04:29.370 --> 04:34.539
Frank, I don't-- I just don't
think this is the best idea
for our candidate's image.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.676
This is a brilliant idea--
"hobo-vertising."

04:37.678 --> 04:40.979
Come on. It looks good.
Beer him.

- He's my dad, Charlie.

But, Dennis. Dennis.
Hobo-vertising?

04:47.388 --> 04:49.087
That's not you.
It's cheap.
Ooh.

04:49.089 --> 04:53.058
It's cheap politics.
It's not gonna get us
that bribe.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.726
I mean, you need
to be out there.

04:54.728 --> 04:58.830
You gotta be shakin' hands.
You gotta be kissin' babies.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.599
I don't like babies.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.434
No babies.
Don't kiss babies.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.070
Just get out there
into the world, and--

05:05.072 --> 05:09.007
You gotta let me be
your campaign manager.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.377
I mean, I can
really drive this thing
in a different direction.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.946

I see success.

with this thing.

in the way here.

05:21.121 --> 05:24.890
Give me this chance.
Just give it to me.

I was gonna have to make
so many... tough decisions.

Take him down.
[ Gasps ]

05:38.439 --> 05:39.705
This is a goddamn coup!

05:39.707 --> 05:41.873
Don't take it personally, Dad.
That's just politics.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.909
You look like a dick
in that tiny jacket.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.478
Let's not attack
my candidate.
Don't go after the jacket.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.113
Shut up, Charlie.
The jacket's good.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.981
I can talk to my son
any way I want.

05:49.983 --> 05:53.018
- Give him the clipboard.
- Give me the clipboard.
- No. No.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.887
Clipboard belongs
to the campaign manager.
I want that clipboard.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.457
- Go to hell.
- Oh, that was ugly.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.892
That was uncalled for.
Mmm.

06:00.894 --> 06:04.629
Wow. That was, uh, a lot easier
than I thought it was gonna be.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.898
I can get a clipboard
anywhere.
Yeah.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.335
All right.
Don't do that.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.142
I want you to run
for comptroller.
What?

06:17.144 --> 06:18.777
I'm gonna be
your campaign manager.

06:18.779 --> 06:23.615
We're gonna stroll right into
that comptroller's office
and solicit a bribe.

06:23.617 --> 06:27.652
Forget it.
I am not helping you.
Deandra, we'll get this bribe,

06:27.654 --> 06:29.521
and we'll shove it
right in your brother's face.

06:29.523 --> 06:34.192
We'll screw those guys.
I would like
to shove it in his face.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.494
Okay.

06:35.496 --> 06:38.096
Okay. Now let's get you ready
for the ball, Cinderella.

06:38.098 --> 06:44.369
What are you doing?
The bangs, they--
The five head.

06:45.972 --> 06:50.008
Let me get this straight.
You want to try
and solicit a bribe?

06:50.010 --> 06:51.276
Yes!

06:51.278 --> 06:53.779
You want my union
to back your roommate...

06:53.781 --> 06:55.981
for South Philly
District 37 Comptroller?

06:55.983 --> 06:58.683
Yes. Correct.
But not to win.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.586
It sounds illegal.
Aw, for God sakes.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.988
What is with you two?
Come on!

07:02.990 --> 07:07.559
You know, like, in the movies,
union guys are, like, tough
and shady and shit.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.228
Sorry to disappoint you.
You're, like, a couple
of nerds.

[ Sighs ] All right, look.
Let me take you bitches
to school for a second.

In this country,
in the real world,
people make money.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.606
Somebody is gonna
make a ton of money
off my roommate.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.810
I want it to be you.
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.845
We are not
a criminal organization.

Why are you talking to me
like I'm a jackass?
I am not a ja--

Okay. Nobody here
is a criminal. No, sir.

the same language.

- Are we?
- Oh, yeah.

07:43.897 --> 07:47.165

I understand. Okay.

I want you to contact me
at Paddy's.

07:52.105 --> 07:55.740
I'm gonna get
the ball rolling, okay?
Mm-hmm.

07:55.742 --> 07:56.975
It's safe there.

Okay, gentlemen, sorry we
couldn't work anything out.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.515
But, uh, I'm gonna go home
and pay my taxes.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.083
Right?

08:05.085 --> 08:09.020
You want me
to call the cops?
Not yet.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.224
I've got a better idea.
Let's screw this
son of a bitch.

08:12.226 --> 08:14.793
Come on, Morris.
We don't have time for this.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.962
He called us nerds, Gary.

08:18.564 --> 08:20.665
Nerds.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.602
Are you gonna take care
of the crime problem here?

08:23.604 --> 08:28.907
Absolutely. I say we put 'em on
busses, ship 'em over to Iraq--
make 'em fight the terrorists.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.942
You're very handsome.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.844
Thank you.
This is going
very, very well, man.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.146
People are really
responding to me.
They love the bone structure.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.015
They like the Kennedy hair.
I've been looking
for you guys.

08:37.017 --> 08:41.820
Look, I've been thinkin',
and I feel like I could be
a real asset to you guys.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.355
- I want to help.
- What? Wait, wait.

08:43.357 --> 08:46.791
First you wash your hands
of politics.
Now you want back in.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.761
That's called flip-flopping.
That's what Democrats do.
Hang on a second.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.830
Let's give the guy
a chance to prove himself.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.332
Yeah. Give me a chance.
What should I do?

08:54.334 --> 08:56.301
"What should I do?"
Strike one, buddy.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.937
You gotta bring something
to the table, Mac.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.373
All right.
Ah, check this out.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.041
Excuse me. Hi.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.044
I couldn't help but notice
your adorable baby.
Oh, thank you.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.380
Yeah, I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind...

09:08.382 --> 09:10.949
if that handsome
young gentleman
over there kissed it.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.784
Excuse me?
Oh. I'm sorry.

He's running for
District 37 Comptroller,
so it's cool.

09:15.322 --> 09:19.291
- You know, I'd rather not.
- It's good for him,
and it's good for you.

09:19.293 --> 09:22.794
I think you should just
give me the baby.
Please leave me alone.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.396
Okay, lady.
[ Baby Crying ]

09:24.398 --> 09:26.631
If you give me the baby,
I could get it over with.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.833
I said no!
Goddamn it!
Just give me the baby!

09:28.835 --> 09:30.802
Somebody help me!
Lady! Give me the ba--

campaign suicide, dude.

There, there, there.

There, there, there.
Take a look.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.115
Got it on? Sure?
Yeah. Take a look.

09:44.117 --> 09:47.852
What do you think?
I think I look
like a whore.

09:47.854 --> 09:50.088
I'm trying
to make you sexy.
This is not sexy.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.224
What is this?
What's this?
It's the bed look.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.093
The tossed look.
The ruffled look.

You look like
you just got--
[ Mutters ]

09:57.297 --> 09:59.331
Anyway, we have
to convince this guy...
[ Sighs ]

09:59.333 --> 10:01.766
that we're a legitimate
threat to his campaign.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.235
There is nothing
more threatening
to a man...

10:04.237 --> 10:07.272
than a woman
who is smart
and attractive.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.709
We have to pretend
you're both.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.678
Wow. You're
a horrible father.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.015

20:09.409 --> 20:12.610
I'm listening.
I need to make Dennis
disappear.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.845
Ah! Ah! That's what
I'm talkin' about.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.747
Really?
I was thinkin'
that same thing, man.

20:16.749 --> 20:20.451
That's great. I know you guys
have become close.
Not that close.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.886
How do you wanna
do this thing?

20:21.888 --> 20:24.088
If we use a gun, we're
gonna need a silencer.
A gun?

20:24.090 --> 20:27.491
Fine. No guns. Piano wire.
Maybe we can use
some piano wire.

20:27.493 --> 20:28.993
Look, whatever it is--
[ Laughs ]

20:28.995 --> 20:31.495
I gotta be the guy
to pull the trigger
on this thing.

20:31.497 --> 20:34.699
Retard. I'm talking
about taking Dennis
to Atlantic City...

20:34.701 --> 20:37.301
for a couple of days
until the election is over.

20:37.303 --> 20:40.037
What are you talkin' about?

20:40.039 --> 20:42.373
Atlantic City.
That's good.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.774
Just take him
down to the shore
for a couple days.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.044
I'll take him to the shore.
We'll go to Atlantic City.
What's wrong with you?

20:47.046 --> 20:50.047
I give the guy my blood, sweat
and tears, right?

20:50.049 --> 20:52.116
And my Garbage Pail Kids.
And--

20:52.118 --> 20:54.485
And he just drops
right out of the race on me.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.721
Dennis dropped out?
He dropped right out
of the race.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.689
So I'm out my Garbage Pail Kid--
And, like--

20:58.691 --> 21:03.594
If we used piano wire on him
for a sec-- As long as we
hurt him a little bit--

21:03.596 --> 21:04.962
Sorry, Charlie.
Plan's off.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.797
What are you doin'?
I'm gonna go
collect my money.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.600
Looks like you bitches
shouldn't have fired me
in the first place.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.669
Are you kiddin' me?
Are you kiddin' me
with that?

21:11.671 --> 21:16.073
I'm gonna buy myself a car.
I am gonna drive as far away
from this goddamn city--

21:16.075 --> 21:18.809
Hey, Mac.
Where you runnin' to?

21:18.811 --> 21:19.777
Huh?

21:19.779 --> 21:23.481
Goin' to visit your friend
over at the union?

21:23.483 --> 21:25.950
What's goin' on?
Is there a problem?

21:25.952 --> 21:28.085
I don't know.
Phil, is there a problem?

21:28.087 --> 21:31.822
Conspiracy
to solicit a bribe.
Racketeering.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.557
I'd say
there's a big problem.

21:33.559 --> 21:36.527
Your buddy over at the union
came to see us recently.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.896
Told us about
your interest in politics.

21:38.898 --> 21:43.567
- He ratted you out, Mac.
- Apparently, you called him
a nerd, Mac.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.970
Some people don't take kindly
to that type of insult.

21:45.972 --> 21:49.040
Yeah. You're goin' away
for a long time,

21:49.042 --> 21:51.876
and prison can be
a very unpleasant place...

21:51.878 --> 21:54.111
for a good-lookin'
young man like yourself.

21:54.113 --> 21:57.348
Oh, yeah. They're gonna
tear through you
like Kleenex.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.749
That is, of course,

21:58.751 --> 22:03.321
unless you got something
to make it worth our while.

22:04.189 --> 22:08.326
Are you soliciting a bribe
from me?

22:08.694 --> 22:11.796
Sorry, pal.
That's politics.
