00:08.800 --> 00:10.264
My name is Nathan Fielder,

00:10.343 --> 00:13.335
and I graduated from one of
Canada's top business schools

00:13.429 --> 00:15.629
with really good grades.

00:15.696 --> 00:17.596
Now I'm using my knowledge

00:17.662 --> 00:19.929
to help struggling small
business owners make it

00:19.996 --> 00:22.596
in this competitive world.

00:22.662 --> 00:26.229
This is "Nathan for You."

00:26.296 --> 00:29.129
In season two of my show,
I gave marketing advice

00:29.196 --> 00:32.628
to a small taxi company
owner named Andy Farshidian,

00:32.695 --> 00:34.396
whose business was being destroyed

00:34.462 --> 00:35.967
by the ride share giant Uber.

00:36.124 --> 00:39.530
_

00:40.096 --> 00:42.929
The idea was to generate
press by encouraging

00:42.996 --> 00:45.729
pregnant riders to
give birth in his taxi.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.629
But what I never saw coming
was that just a few months

00:48.696 --> 00:52.096
after that episode aired
Uber just happened to launch

00:52.162 --> 00:55.929
a new campaign offering
free baby onesies to anyone

00:55.996 --> 00:58.596
who gives birth in one of their cars.

00:58.662 --> 01:02.562
Encouraging customers births
to get press was our idea.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.696
And when I met up with
Andy to tell him about it,

01:04.762 --> 01:06.762
he couldn't believe his eyes.

01:06.829 --> 01:09.429
You know, you're right.

01:09.496 --> 01:12.029
They stole our idea.

01:12.096 --> 01:13.496
Did you know about this?

01:13.562 --> 01:14.762
No, I never saw this.

01:14.829 --> 01:16.696
This is the first time I saw it.

01:16.762 --> 01:20.162
After already having taken so
much from this struggling cabby,

01:20.229 --> 01:22.196
for Uber, this was a new low.

01:22.262 --> 01:25.296
Business had gotten so
bad that Andy had resorted

01:25.396 --> 01:28.496
to turning his cab into
a mobile karaoke booth

01:28.562 --> 01:31.629
in a last-ditch effort to
hold on to his customers.

01:31.696 --> 01:34.162
♪ Say my name say my name ♪

01:34.229 --> 01:35.296
♪ Around you ♪

01:35.396 --> 01:36.896
♪ Say I love you ♪

01:36.962 --> 01:38.529
♪ If you... my name ♪

01:38.596 --> 01:40.629
♪ Say my name say my name ♪

01:40.696 --> 01:42.862
It was clear we had to do something.

01:42.929 --> 01:45.629
So I sat down with Andy
to discuss our options.

01:45.696 --> 01:47.196
I never get mad.

01:47.262 --> 01:48.862
I'm very cool and calm all time time,

01:48.929 --> 01:51.862
but I am so furious that
they did this to you.

01:51.929 --> 01:53.529
They stole everything.
You know what I mean?

01:53.596 --> 01:55.962
The idea, the money, the
passenger, everything.

01:56.029 --> 01:57.696
They stole everything, you know?

01:57.762 --> 02:01.729
Well, I have an idea,
but it's pretty crazy.

02:01.796 --> 02:03.629
Talk to me.

02:03.696 --> 02:05.729
Uber may be a powerful company,

02:05.796 --> 02:08.529
but there's a big vulnerability
in their business model.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.628
Anyone can become a driver.

02:10.696 --> 02:13.829
So if we recruited a fleet
of disgruntled cabbies

02:13.896 --> 02:15.629
to sign up as Uber drivers,

02:15.696 --> 02:18.096
we could effectively
create a sleeper cell

02:18.162 --> 02:20.862
of rogue agents within the Uber network,

02:20.929 --> 02:23.296
allowing Andy I with
the push of a button

02:23.396 --> 02:25.429
to turn our drivers into nightmares

02:25.496 --> 02:28.396
and unleash total
chaos across the globe.

02:28.462 --> 02:31.829
get Uber to stop
using those baby onesies

02:31.896 --> 02:34.162
by threatening them with a sleeper cell.

02:34.229 --> 02:36.096
A sleeper cell, you said?

02:36.162 --> 02:38.262
- Sleeper cell.
- A sleeper cell.

02:38.396 --> 02:40.729
- Not sleeping.
- Yeah, just a sleep cell.

02:40.796 --> 02:42.429
- Sleeper.
- Oh, sleeper.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.929
- Sleeper cell.
- Oh, the person asleep.

02:43.996 --> 02:45.562
- Sleeper cell.
- But no one's sleeping.

02:45.629 --> 02:47.229
- Yeah, I know.
- Right.

02:47.296 --> 02:49.096
- Yeah, okay.
- 'Cause once Uber realizes

02:49.162 --> 02:52.696
a large portion of their
drivers are under our control,

02:52.762 --> 02:55.496
they'll have no choice but
to listen to your demands.

02:55.562 --> 02:56.962
Very smart, very smart.

02:57.029 --> 02:58.696
And at that point, you can tell them,

02:58.762 --> 03:00.496
"Get rid of that onesie."

03:00.562 --> 03:02.429
Knock them down.

03:02.496 --> 03:04.796
That's the best idea.

03:04.862 --> 03:06.462
I love you, man.

03:06.529 --> 03:10.262
I, uh... I love you too.

03:13.164 --> 03:14.564
Okay, so I think that's good for today.

03:14.630 --> 03:16.397
Okay.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.364
I'd never started a sleeper cell before.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.464
But in doing some research online,

03:20.530 --> 03:23.330
I learned that the key to
running any clandestine cell

03:23.397 --> 03:26.564
operation is having a
communication structure that

03:26.630 --> 03:28.997
kept the identities
of the leaders secret.

03:29.064 --> 03:32.464
That way, if any of our
sleeper agents were compromised,

03:32.530 --> 03:34.730
they wouldn't be able
to rat us out to Uber

03:34.797 --> 03:36.864
and bring down the cell.

03:36.930 --> 03:40.330
From now on, we couldn't risk
using our personal phones.

03:40.397 --> 03:43.030
We'd have to get prepaid burner phones.

03:43.164 --> 03:46.197
So to make sure the purchase
couldn't be traced back to us,

03:46.264 --> 03:48.864
I anonymously hired
someone off Craigslist

03:48.930 --> 03:51.864
to go to a local Walgreens and
told him there would be cash

03:51.930 --> 03:55.330
hidden in a dirty McDonald's
cup outside the location,

03:55.397 --> 03:58.264
which he was to use to buy
up the store's entire supply

03:58.330 --> 04:00.430
of prepaid cell phones.

04:00.497 --> 04:02.964
The Craigslist guy was told
to then bring the phones

04:03.030 --> 04:05.930
to an abandoned pier
at the San Pedro harbor

04:05.997 --> 04:07.964
at exactly 1:15 p.m.,

04:08.030 --> 04:10.464
where he would find a
waterproof pouch hidden

04:10.530 --> 04:13.730
inside a white first aid
kit at the end of the dock.

04:13.797 --> 04:17.329
He was then instructed to put
all the phones into the pouch,

04:17.397 --> 04:20.464
hook the base of the pouch
to a nearby cinder block,

04:20.529 --> 04:23.730
and throw it off the pier,
where unbeknownst to him,

04:23.797 --> 04:26.597
I was awaiting the
delivery in full scuba gear

04:26.664 --> 04:29.430
beneath the surface
completing the final step

04:29.497 --> 04:32.064
of a burner phone purchase
that would be impossible

04:32.164 --> 04:35.297
to trace back to either me or Andy.

04:35.364 --> 04:37.997
Now that we had a way to
communicate with our drivers,

04:38.064 --> 04:40.964
we would need to figure out
the commands to give them.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.397
So I started researching
Uber Yelp reviews

04:43.464 --> 04:46.630
and online comments to see
what behaviors from drivers

04:46.697 --> 04:48.597
customers hated the most.

04:48.664 --> 04:51.797
The complaints ranged
from foul-smelling vehicles

04:51.864 --> 04:56.164
to telling offensive jokes
to blasting terrible music.

04:56.164 --> 04:58.530
But to know which combination
of these would be most

04:58.597 --> 05:00.864
effective, we would
need to test them out

05:00.930 --> 05:02.864
on actual Uber customers.

05:02.930 --> 05:06.697
So I had Andy go undercover
and sign up for an Uber driver

05:06.764 --> 05:08.730
account with his personal vehicle.

05:08.797 --> 05:11.330
And after taking it
for a final inspection

05:11.397 --> 05:13.564
posing as an average Joe looking to make

05:13.630 --> 05:15.197
a few extra bucks on the side...

05:15.264 --> 05:16.897
Yeah, I'm just an average Joe,

05:16.964 --> 05:19.297
make some money the side, you know.

05:21.064 --> 05:23.197
Yeah, I'm a normal guy.

05:23.264 --> 05:26.730
Andy was now registered as a
fully accredited Uber driver.

05:26.797 --> 05:28.897
And that meant we could begin our test.

05:28.964 --> 05:30.697
"Playing bad music," yep.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.264
"Bad smell, driver..."

05:33.330 --> 05:34.697
Driver what?

05:34.764 --> 05:37.164
- Gas.
- Oh, that's bad, yeah.

05:37.197 --> 05:39.830
- What's the worst of these?
- The worst one's

05:39.897 --> 05:41.897
driver gets lost... go 5 right?

05:41.964 --> 05:44.797
You're supposed to go to
5 North, drive me 5 South.

05:44.864 --> 05:48.230
That's it. They're
like, "No, it's crazy."

05:48.297 --> 05:50.464
Do you know how to do these, like...

05:50.530 --> 05:51.597
Oh, of course.

05:51.664 --> 05:53.197
I'm the master of these.

05:53.264 --> 05:54.930
You're already a bad driver?

05:54.997 --> 05:58.330
No, I'm not bad driver, but
I have lots of experience.

05:58.397 --> 06:00.730
To simulate the smell of driver farting,

06:00.797 --> 06:03.330
I brought Andy box full of ziplock bags

06:03.397 --> 06:06.197
each filled with a
sulfur-based stink spray.

06:06.264 --> 06:08.264
- So it's, like, one per ride.
- Okay.

06:08.330 --> 06:09.397
They smell really bad.

06:09.464 --> 06:11.164
Oh, they... oh, okay.

06:11.164 --> 06:12.930
To test the effects of bad music,

06:12.997 --> 06:15.330
I gave him a burned
CD with an endless loop

06:15.397 --> 06:19.597
of Lou Bega's 1999 hit
"Mambo No. 5" on it,

06:19.664 --> 06:21.564
considered by many experts to be one of

06:21.630 --> 06:23.430
the worst songs ever made.

06:23.497 --> 06:25.264
So with everything prepped,

06:25.330 --> 06:27.430
Andy turned on his
Uber app and headed out

06:27.497 --> 06:29.897
to pick up some customers.

06:29.964 --> 06:32.297
- Hello. How are you?
- Fine. How about you?

06:32.364 --> 06:34.064
- What's your name?
- Lori.

06:34.164 --> 06:36.230
Lori, yeah.

06:36.297 --> 06:37.630
Well, it doesn't matter the price.

06:37.697 --> 06:40.530
How did it come out?

06:40.597 --> 06:42.530
Yeah.

06:42.597 --> 06:44.630
Uh-huh.

06:44.697 --> 06:47.530
Excuse me. Can I... can
we roll down the window?

06:47.597 --> 06:49.197
Oh, the window doesn't
work. It's broken.

06:49.264 --> 06:50.564
- It doesn't go down?
- No.

06:50.630 --> 06:52.897
Oh, 'cause it smells in here.

06:52.964 --> 06:54.764
Oh, I'm in an Uber right now.

06:54.830 --> 06:57.997
I'm going someplace, and
the window doesn't go down.

06:58.064 --> 07:00.364
And it kind of smells in here..

07:00.430 --> 07:02.297
So... oh, wait. No, so I can't...

07:02.364 --> 07:04.297
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is mambo number five.

07:04.364 --> 07:06.330
- Oh, wait. I'm on the phone.
- I'm sorry. I'm on the phone.

07:06.397 --> 07:08.730
Excuse me. Sir.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.530
Sir, I'm on the phone.

07:12.597 --> 07:15.797
Oh, my God. I'm gonna get out.

07:15.864 --> 07:18.164
♪ One, two, three, four, five ♪

07:18.230 --> 07:19.997
I'm getting out.

07:20.064 --> 07:22.530
The first ride lasted
less than a minute,

07:22.597 --> 07:23.964
and after running through our list

07:24.030 --> 07:25.597
with several other customers...

07:25.664 --> 07:26.997
Yo, I think I'm lost, man.

07:27.064 --> 07:28.830
You're lost?

07:28.897 --> 07:30.830
The most intolerable
Uber driver behaviors

07:30.897 --> 07:31.964
became clear.

07:32.030 --> 07:34.030
Turn off the music.

07:34.164 --> 07:35.797
Cut it off.

07:35.864 --> 07:37.930
Turn off the music.

07:37.997 --> 07:38.964
♪ ♪

07:39.030 --> 07:40.864
Turn off the music.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.630
And after a full day of testing,

07:42.697 --> 07:44.797
we got the results we were hoping for.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.364
Bad rating.

07:46.430 --> 07:48.064
- Bad rating.
- They gave me all bad rating.

07:48.164 --> 07:50.330
With our activation plan in place,

07:50.397 --> 07:54.330
we decided to name our sleeper
cell after Andy's dog Lucky.

07:54.397 --> 07:56.397
Because he thought it
would bring us luck.

07:56.464 --> 08:00.697
So maybe we get lucky,
you know, from his name.

08:00.764 --> 08:03.564
So I created a website that
would act as our main hub

08:03.630 --> 08:05.564
for recruits to sign up.

08:05.630 --> 08:08.964
Now I just had to get word
spreading amongst taxi drivers.

08:10.546 --> 08:13.438
Because I had to remain
anonymous while recruiting

08:13.467 --> 08:15.900
drivers, I went to a
local hospital pickup zone

08:16.416 --> 08:19.249
disguised as someone who had
just been released from surgery

08:19.316 --> 08:21.016
and began hailing cabs.

08:21.116 --> 08:22.616
- Hi, there.
- Yes.

08:22.682 --> 08:24.382
- Where do you want to go?
- Just circle the block.

08:24.449 --> 08:26.616
We have business to discuss.

08:26.682 --> 08:29.116
My goal was to get word
spreading that an anti-Uber

08:29.149 --> 08:31.216
resistance was looking for members.

08:31.282 --> 08:33.182
So how's the taxi business going?

08:33.227 --> 08:36.774
_

08:36.982 --> 08:38.649
Not doing as well as you used to?

08:38.679 --> 08:40.054
_

08:40.116 --> 08:41.482
Why is that?

08:41.532 --> 08:45.352
_

08:45.516 --> 08:47.916
If you're interested in
helping take Uber down,

08:47.982 --> 08:50.116
give me a call.

08:50.116 --> 08:53.182
I spent the entire day hailing cabs,

08:53.249 --> 08:56.416
driving in a circle,
and talking up drivers.

08:56.482 --> 08:58.849
Would you be happier
if Uber wasn't around?

08:58.931 --> 09:01.040
_

09:01.116 --> 09:03.016
Well, there might be a way to do that.

09:03.116 --> 09:05.649
Each of the business cards
I gave them had a burner

09:05.716 --> 09:07.782
phone number on it where
they could get information

09:07.849 --> 09:10.649
about a meeting that would
be happening later that week.

09:10.691 --> 09:13.434
_

09:14.249 --> 09:16.316
The interested cabbies who reached out

09:16.382 --> 09:18.949
were given the address of a
local day care I had rented

09:19.016 --> 09:21.516
after hours, where they
were told the leaders of

09:21.582 --> 09:23.516
The Lucky Group would be speaking.

09:23.582 --> 09:26.116
So while the cabbies trickled
in and helped themselves

09:26.149 --> 09:28.182
to our spread of complimentary snacks,

09:28.249 --> 09:30.716
Andy and I got ready in
the back storage room.

09:30.782 --> 09:32.782
- Does it fit okay?
- Yeah.

09:32.849 --> 09:35.616
But even with disguises, Andy
was concerned that a fellow

09:35.682 --> 09:37.949
cabbie might recognize his voice.

09:38.016 --> 09:40.782
I'm the most famous cab
driver in Orange County.

09:40.849 --> 09:42.282
- Everybody knows me.
- Really?

09:42.349 --> 09:44.782
- Yeah.
- Can you do any accents?

09:44.849 --> 09:47.949
Or can you disguise
your voice in any way?

09:48.016 --> 09:51.116
So how about Southeast United States,

09:51.182 --> 09:52.649
somewhere around there,

09:52.716 --> 09:54.449
Louisiana or something in that area?

09:54.516 --> 09:56.516
Sure.

09:56.582 --> 09:59.116
How was your day, partner?

09:59.149 --> 10:00.616
How is your business?

10:00.682 --> 10:03.416
The taxi's gone, man.

10:03.482 --> 10:04.949
That's Louisiana?

10:05.016 --> 10:06.949
- Somewhere around Louisiana.
- Oh.

10:07.016 --> 10:08.516
Maybe it's not exactly, but
somewhere around Louisiana,

10:08.582 --> 10:10.116
the Southeast, I know that one.

10:10.182 --> 10:11.816
Yeah, I think that will work.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.749
- Okay.
- Sure, yeah, okay.

10:13.816 --> 10:16.682
And with that, we headed
out to begin the orientation.

10:16.749 --> 10:20.549
I'd like to apologize for the disguises.

10:20.616 --> 10:22.682
But what we're doing is
very sensitive in nature,

10:22.749 --> 10:24.949
so they are necessary.

10:25.016 --> 10:28.382
Firstly, thank you all for being here.

10:31.149 --> 10:33.149
We are The Lucky Group.

10:33.216 --> 10:36.116
So we all agree that
the Uber corporation

10:36.182 --> 10:38.049
has destroyed our industry, right?

10:38.116 --> 10:39.216
Yes.

10:39.282 --> 10:41.649
Our business down 60%.

10:41.716 --> 10:43.116
- 85%
- Wow.

10:43.182 --> 10:45.016
Since Uber.

10:45.082 --> 10:47.749
As soon as Uber was mentioned,
a wave of frustration

10:47.816 --> 10:49.782
swept over the room.

10:49.849 --> 10:54.616
Uber corporation itself taken
over everything, everything.

10:54.682 --> 10:56.749
It is completely unfair.

10:56.816 --> 10:59.516
We're working with our permits.

10:59.582 --> 11:02.216
We're working with background checks.

11:02.282 --> 11:05.482
You know, whenever I see
bad news coming out of Uber,

11:05.549 --> 11:08.482
I will see rape, rape, and
then, "We deliver puppies."

11:08.549 --> 11:11.816
I will not allow anyone in my family

11:11.882 --> 11:14.516
to ride in an Uber vehicle.

11:14.582 --> 11:17.149
Because it's... not
because it's competition

11:17.216 --> 11:18.849
but because it's unsafe.

11:18.916 --> 11:21.216
I cannot pay my mortgage.

11:21.282 --> 11:25.116
I cannot buy good shoes for my children.

11:25.149 --> 11:27.749
Listening to these stories,
I began to understand

11:27.816 --> 11:30.882
the human cost of Uber's
unquenchable thirst

11:30.949 --> 11:32.116
for expansion.

11:32.116 --> 11:33.849
And it's not me alone.

11:33.916 --> 11:36.016
Maybe thousands and thousands like me.

11:36.116 --> 11:39.682
I just hoped Andy would be
able to sell them on our plan.

11:39.749 --> 11:41.449
I think have more experience

11:41.516 --> 11:45.182
than any of you in taxi business.

11:45.249 --> 11:48.216
I started in taxi business in about

11:48.282 --> 11:52.582
1984, '85.

11:52.649 --> 11:55.416
1980 right here.

11:55.482 --> 11:59.682
Oh, okay, so you have four
years more experience than me.

11:59.749 --> 12:02.782
It was a bit of a rocky
start, but pretty soon,

12:02.849 --> 12:04.249
they started to get it.

12:04.316 --> 12:08.616
I want you to humiliate Uber driver

12:08.682 --> 12:10.616
and get one star.

12:10.682 --> 12:12.416
How it is gonna affect the whole system?

12:12.482 --> 12:14.282
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What he's saying is,

12:14.349 --> 12:16.582
you give bad service to a customer.

12:16.649 --> 12:18.249
- Bad service?
- Yeah.

12:18.316 --> 12:20.216
- Thank you.
- And before long,

12:20.282 --> 12:22.282
it seemed like we had won them over.

12:22.349 --> 12:24.582
From our company alone,

12:24.649 --> 12:28.449
I will tell about 250
drivers went to Uber,

12:28.516 --> 12:30.416
and I have contact with all of them.

12:30.482 --> 12:32.282
So they are sleeper cells,

12:32.349 --> 12:34.649
all those people holding
City of Los Angeles

12:34.716 --> 12:36.549
taxicab driving permits.

12:36.616 --> 12:38.116
So you have 250 people.

12:38.149 --> 12:40.249
I have... I don't have
to persuade anybody.

12:40.316 --> 12:43.649
I can give you names and
driver's license numbers

12:43.716 --> 12:45.949
in a matter of 25 minutes.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.116
The meeting couldn't have gone better,

12:48.149 --> 12:50.916
and the drivers were eager
to hand out our website info

12:50.982 --> 12:52.816
to all of their friends.

12:52.882 --> 12:53.882
I will... I have bunch of
friends I'm gonna give them to.

12:53.949 --> 12:54.882
- Really?
- Yes.

12:54.949 --> 12:56.682
Thank you so much.

12:56.749 --> 12:59.116
Within a week, we
already had 62 sign-ups

12:59.182 --> 13:01.149
in The Lucky Group inbox.

13:01.216 --> 13:03.982
So with momentum building,
I felt it was time to

13:04.116 --> 13:06.616
prepare a short video to make Uber aware

13:06.682 --> 13:08.616
of our presence.

13:09.467 --> 13:15.286
_

13:15.863 --> 13:18.854
_

13:19.089 --> 13:22.995
_

13:24.525 --> 13:30.447
_

13:30.616 --> 13:36.139
_

13:36.484 --> 13:41.117
_

13:41.289 --> 13:45.555
_

13:45.693 --> 13:51.725
_

13:53.328 --> 13:56.343
_

13:56.469 --> 14:01.672
_

14:01.829 --> 14:06.188
_

14:08.532 --> 14:10.860
_

14:12.742 --> 14:15.266
I was pretty happy with
how the video turned out.

14:15.454 --> 14:16.988
But before sending it to Uber,

14:16.988 --> 14:19.654
I wanted to show Andy
it to get his thoughts.

14:24.488 --> 14:29.488
It's a little bit...

14:29.554 --> 14:31.621
you go too far.

14:31.688 --> 14:34.888
After watching the video,
Andy seemed very concerned.

14:34.988 --> 14:39.221
It's not... they then sue
us, we go to jail, all of us.

14:39.288 --> 14:41.221
And that made me worry too.

14:41.288 --> 14:43.754
I hadn't fully
considered the legal risks

14:43.821 --> 14:45.821
of starting a sleeper cell.

14:45.888 --> 14:48.554
And as a Canadian citizen,
if I got charged with even

14:48.621 --> 14:51.821
a misdemeanor, it would be
a violation of my green card,

14:51.888 --> 14:55.554
and I'd be deported from the
country I've grown to love,

14:55.621 --> 14:58.988
America, so I did some research
to see if there was anything

14:59.054 --> 15:01.388
that could protect me from deportation.

15:01.454 --> 15:03.221
And it seemed like the only
thing that could give me

15:03.288 --> 15:06.421
immunity was if I
married a U.S. citizen.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.821
There was no one in my life
who would marry me right now.

15:09.888 --> 15:12.721
I tried asking Andy if he
would marry me as a favor,

15:12.788 --> 15:14.154
but he didn't want to do it.

15:14.221 --> 15:16.088
Just legal status?

15:16.154 --> 15:18.021
Yeah.

15:18.088 --> 15:20.721
I don't want to marry a man.

15:20.788 --> 15:23.788
So with the clock ticking
and no romantic prospects,

15:23.854 --> 15:26.554
I felt like the only way
to safely move forward

15:26.621 --> 15:29.288
was to marry Andy without his knowledge.

15:29.354 --> 15:32.554
My plan was to make it appear
to Andy like we were just

15:32.621 --> 15:35.621
gonna grab some Chinese
takeout for lunch one day.

15:35.688 --> 15:37.688
So I rented out a Chinese restaurant

15:37.754 --> 15:40.154
and redesigned their
menu to only consist

15:40.221 --> 15:43.221
of unappealing dishes
that no reasonable person

15:43.288 --> 15:45.021
would want to order.

15:45.088 --> 15:47.221
The only exception
was the house special,

15:47.288 --> 15:50.454
a chicken and broccoli
dish called Ai-doo.

15:50.521 --> 15:53.688
To officiate the ceremony, I
hired someone who specialized

15:53.754 --> 15:55.821
in traditional Chinese weddings.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.254
Oh, my gosh. I so nervous.

15:58.754 --> 16:00.288
- Don't be. Don't be.
- Okay.

16:00.354 --> 16:02.654
- All right, so... so...
- To be clear,

16:02.721 --> 16:04.188
the ceremony's gonna
be entirely in Mandarin?

16:04.254 --> 16:06.154
- In Mandarin.
- That's correct.

16:06.221 --> 16:07.621
Okay, you're not gonna say a
word of English the whole time?

16:07.688 --> 16:08.988
No, I won't say a word of English.

16:09.054 --> 16:11.088
- Okay.
- Now, is Andy gonna

16:11.154 --> 16:12.454
understand Chinese?

16:12.521 --> 16:13.788
- Of course, yeah.
- Yeah.

16:13.854 --> 16:15.454
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

16:15.521 --> 16:18.454
So this where I was
thinking you could stand...

16:18.521 --> 16:20.221
- All right.
- And do the ceremony.

16:20.288 --> 16:21.754
- Oh, really?
- And we'll come in there.

16:21.821 --> 16:23.788
Okay.

16:23.854 --> 16:25.821
So with our officiant in
place, I met Andy outside

16:25.888 --> 16:27.621
when he arrived.

16:27.688 --> 16:29.688
One thing before we go
in; it's really authentic,

16:29.754 --> 16:32.421
the restaurant, so it's
respectful if you order

16:32.488 --> 16:33.654
your dish in Mandarin.

16:33.721 --> 16:35.088
It's written out phonetically.

16:35.154 --> 16:37.021
Oh, okay.

16:37.088 --> 16:40.988
And with that, we headed
inside to get married.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:05.154 --> 17:07.354
- What did he say?
- I think he...

17:07.421 --> 17:08.588
he wants you to order.

17:08.654 --> 17:11.721
Oh, you want me to order.

17:11.788 --> 17:13.988
So... Ai-doo.

17:23.088 --> 17:25.021
I do.

17:25.088 --> 17:27.554
I told the officiant I wanted
our marriage certificate

17:27.621 --> 17:30.521
to look like a restaurant bill
as an homage to our first date

17:30.588 --> 17:31.821
where we split the check.

17:31.888 --> 17:33.288
So you accept Visa, right?

17:33.354 --> 17:35.188
After Andy and I each paid,

17:35.254 --> 17:37.421
we signed what he
believed was the receipt...

17:39.221 --> 17:41.488
Officially making us
jie hun, or married,

17:41.554 --> 17:43.988
in the eyes of the state of California.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.154
It was a little odd
sitting across from someone

17:46.221 --> 17:48.354
who had no clue they were your husband.

17:48.421 --> 17:50.888
But all that really mattered
is that I was now legally

17:50.988 --> 17:54.121
protected, so we could finally
move forward with our plan.

17:56.892 --> 17:59.489
I was still a little nervous
about delivering our video

17:59.552 --> 18:02.395
to Uber, as I knew that
once I sent this email,

18:02.458 --> 18:05.315
they would do everything in
their power to track us down.

18:05.333 --> 18:09.267
So before sending it, I cleared
my entire browser history,

18:09.333 --> 18:11.467
including cookies, and destroyed

18:11.500 --> 18:13.467
any remaining evidence

18:13.467 --> 18:16.100
that could link either me
or Andy to The Lucky Group.

18:16.167 --> 18:19.733
I didn't want to leave a
single trace of our existence.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.867
Even the daycare we met at was fake

18:21.933 --> 18:25.600
and designed from the very
start to disappear by morning.

18:25.667 --> 18:28.600
But when I called in Andy
to delete his Uber account,

18:28.667 --> 18:30.367
he dropped a bombshell.

18:30.467 --> 18:31.867
What's all this?

18:31.933 --> 18:35.567
These are how many...
you've got five star.

18:35.633 --> 18:37.300
This is...

18:37.367 --> 18:39.567
No, but why have you
been doing Uber rides?

18:39.633 --> 18:43.633
You're doing rides every single day.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.633
Yeah.

18:45.660 --> 18:48.160
Andy had logged hundreds
of rides on the account

18:48.267 --> 18:51.120
I set up for him since the
time we completed our test.

18:51.277 --> 18:52.877
Well, so is this your job now?

18:52.944 --> 18:54.411
Are you an Uber driver?

18:54.477 --> 18:56.111
- No, I'm not an Uber driver.
- I mean...

18:56.111 --> 18:57.677
- Well, what do you mean?
- You've done...

18:57.744 --> 18:59.477
No, I started to research
about that company.

18:59.544 --> 19:01.811
But you're driving for Uber full-time.

19:01.877 --> 19:03.477
- Because I...
- Andy, that wasn't the plan.

19:03.544 --> 19:05.111
- Yeah, I know.
- We're supposed to be...

19:05.177 --> 19:07.477
But I have to survive somehow.

19:07.544 --> 19:10.011
Andy admitted that he
was now relying on Uber

19:10.111 --> 19:12.111
for his entire income

19:12.144 --> 19:14.477
and had been keeping it a
secret from me for weeks.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.611
Why didn't you tell
me you were doing this?

19:16.677 --> 19:19.444
Oh, I don't know why should I tell you,

19:19.511 --> 19:23.144
because, you know, compared to taxis,

19:23.211 --> 19:27.977
it's easier to go to pick up,
get the car, all those things.

19:28.111 --> 19:30.211
I don't even come from taxi anymore.

19:30.277 --> 19:33.244
He was now worried that if we
continued with the sleeper cell,

19:33.311 --> 19:35.544
it would affect his driver rating.

19:35.611 --> 19:39.111
And that's when I realized
Andy had been turned.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.344
When he took me outside
and showed me that he had

19:41.411 --> 19:44.911
transferred his entire
karaoke machine into his Uber,

19:44.977 --> 19:47.211
words were not even necessary.

19:47.277 --> 19:49.577
We knew this was the
end of The Lucky Group

19:49.644 --> 19:51.311
and our fight for the onesie.

19:51.377 --> 19:53.544
I had the first karaoke
taxi in the world.

19:53.611 --> 19:58.411
Now have the first
karaoke Uber in the world.

19:58.477 --> 20:00.777
I couldn't help but feel a bit betrayed,

20:00.844 --> 20:03.577
but maybe from the very start
we had been fighting a battle

20:03.644 --> 20:05.611
that could never be won.

20:05.677 --> 20:08.477
Just like telegraphs had
been replaced by telephones

20:08.544 --> 20:10.744
and horse and buggies by cars,

20:10.811 --> 20:13.444
the free market had
again chosen a winner.

20:13.511 --> 20:15.144
The real enemy wasn't Uber.

20:15.211 --> 20:17.311
It was progress.

20:17.377 --> 20:19.777
If Andy didn't want to move
forward with the sleeper cell,

20:19.844 --> 20:22.744
there was also no longer a
need for us to be married.

20:22.811 --> 20:24.744
So I sat down with a divorce lawyer

20:24.811 --> 20:26.677
to explain my situation.

20:26.744 --> 20:29.577
Oh, so what did he think was
going on during that time?

20:29.644 --> 20:31.977
He just thought he was
ordering lunch from someone

20:32.044 --> 20:34.077
at a Chinese restaurant.

20:36.511 --> 20:37.457
Okay.

20:37.613 --> 20:39.577
Fortunately, the
lawyer said our marriage

20:39.644 --> 20:41.277
would be easy to nullify.

20:41.344 --> 20:44.344
So that's where the
element of fraud comes in,

20:44.411 --> 20:45.911
that you brought him to the restaurant

20:45.977 --> 20:48.077
under false pretense,

20:48.144 --> 20:50.877
that you performed the
ceremony without his knowledge

20:50.944 --> 20:52.811
and in another language.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.577
But as I sat there
listening to him lecture me

20:54.644 --> 20:56.577
about all the mistakes I had made,

20:56.644 --> 20:58.777
I was reminded of the vows we had taken

20:58.844 --> 21:00.311
at that Chinese restaurant.

21:02.477 --> 21:05.144
I had promised to love and
accept Andy for who he was,

21:05.211 --> 21:07.277
not who I wanted him to be.

21:07.344 --> 21:08.554
I do.

21:08.656 --> 21:12.177
So if Andy wanted to be an
Uber driver, I'd support him,

21:12.244 --> 21:14.144
because no matter who he worked for,

21:14.211 --> 21:17.344
I knew no one could stop
him from being himself.

21:17.411 --> 21:21.011
Oh, this a karaoke Uber,

21:21.111 --> 21:23.744
so you can sing.

21:23.811 --> 21:28.111
♪ A feather in his cap
and called it macaroni ♪

21:28.111 --> 21:30.311
♪ Yankee Doodle keep it up ♪

21:30.377 --> 21:32.611

21:32.677 --> 21:34.644

21:34.711 --> 21:37.277

21:39.711 --> 21:40.744
Hoo.

21:42.442 --> 21:44.562
So you're aware, Andy
and I won't be kissing,

21:44.877 --> 21:46.977
because he has an STD right now.

21:47.111 --> 21:49.277
- Oh, okay.
- Is that okay?

21:49.344 --> 21:51.277
- Yeah, no, that's fine.
- You don't have to kiss.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.511
- I mean, you can hug.
- Okay, sure, yeah.

21:53.577 --> 21:55.744
- But both of you have to sign...
- sign the papers.

21:55.811 --> 21:56.844
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
