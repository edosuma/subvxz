WEBVTT

00:09.509 --> 00:11.845
Mom.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.597
Mom.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.600
- What'd the doctor say?

00:21.730 --> 00:22.731
Mom?

00:25.734 --> 00:28.111
- They don't know if he'll walk again.
- No.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.822
No. Don't say that to me.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.828
Come on. Come on.
We gotta be strong.

00:38.496 --> 00:42.042
You gotta be strong for your brother.
Okay? You ready?

00:56.473 --> 00:58.600
 I don't know. We were talking
and... and... I...

00:58.600 --> 01:00.226
He was trying to get me
to chill out, right?

01:00.226 --> 01:02.687
But he was also upset, too.
And then, at first,

01:02.687 --> 01:06.191
- I just thought he stumbled, but...
- Breathe. Okay, Josh? Breathe.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.151
Take it slow.
We'll find out what happened.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.279
- JB.
- I'm here.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.114
- I'm coming.
- Mrs. Bell.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.326
- Oh, Dr. Hong. How is he?
- Chuck is awake.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.245
And he is doing much better.
The hospital notified me right away.

01:19.537 --> 01:20.622
So, he's gonna be okay, right?

01:21.039 --> 01:23.458
We're taking care of your father.
He is in good hands.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.336
Can you give me a moment alone
with your mother?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.630
Skinny is on his way, okay?
Go. Go have a seat.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.298
No, we need to know
what's going on with Dad.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.425
- Come on, JB.
- No, that's our dad in there, man.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.636
- This is not the time.
- Thought you said there were no secrets

01:34.636 --> 01:36.971
- in this family.
- This is not about secrets, JB.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.723
This is about life and...

01:41.976 --> 01:45.146
Please. Just give us a few seconds, okay?

01:51.820 --> 01:54.114
But is this something new?
Something you didn't see before?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.449
Well, his blood work shows a depletion
in red blood cells,

01:56.449 --> 01:58.827
so the lack of oxygen
could be a contributing factor

01:58.827 --> 02:00.203
as to why he passed out.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.914
Wait. I don't understand. He seemed
like he was on the right track.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.291
- Doctor, he checked every box.
- I think we are past

02:05.291 --> 02:06.584
the point of damage control.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.295
Right now, we need to focus
on adjusting his treatment.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.298
- So, what does that look like?
- We need to start dialysis.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.676
I know it's a lot to process
and this isn't the news

02:14.676 --> 02:16.136
that you wanted to hear,
but unfortunately,

02:16.427 --> 02:18.054
this is what we're dealing with.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.183
Why couldn't they have just told us
what was going on?

02:22.517 --> 02:24.310
We should've known
how sick he really was, man.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.396
- They were trying to protect us.
- From what?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.189
The fact that we might grow up
without a dad?

02:31.609 --> 02:32.861
I know Mom's scared.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.865
- That's why she snapped at me.
- To tell you the truth,

02:38.616 --> 02:39.617
I'm scared.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.123
Me too, man.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.769
You can come closer. I'm not gonna bite.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.522
I was trying to let you rest.

03:13.401 --> 03:17.280
Babe, I'm sorry
you had to go through this.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.200
- I was trying to do everything right.
- I know.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.203
We will not lose, Chuck.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.040
- We all need you. Especially the boys.
- Hmm. Where are they?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.791
They're in the hall.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.378
But Chuck... they're worried.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.131
So, what's the game plan, Coach?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.133
Well, Dr. Hong...

03:39.052 --> 03:40.136
gave us our options,

03:40.136 --> 03:42.847
and she does not want us
to rule out a relative donor.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.891
No, wait. I don't wanna go to Kelli yet.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.101
- And those boys, they're too young.
Okay.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.687
But while we wait on the donor list,
they're gonna start you on dialysis.

03:49.812 --> 03:50.897
- Dialysis?
Yes.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.691
No. Hey, I don't wanna be stuck
in this hospital.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.568
Well, lucky for you,

03:55.693 --> 03:58.488
they prefer that the patient
do the treatment at home.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.907
- Hmm.
- No excuses.

04:03.409 --> 04:07.789
Hey. There they are.
Soon-to-be city champs.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.000
- Think you'll get out by game time?
- Nothing's gonna keep me from that game.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.129
Hey, I'm sorry.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.340
I'm sorry I scared you.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.801
The doctors,
they're figuring all this out.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.261
So, they're gonna release you, right?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.680
Yeah, they should,
like, in a couple of hours.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.267
Now, look,

04:27.642 --> 04:30.687
just because I'm on the bench,
doesn't mean things need to change.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.775
JB, I need a hundred free throws a day
and for you to study those game tapes.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.986
Now, you've been waiting for this
since you started middle school.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.697
- Now, it's here.
- Nah, it didn't look like this.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.909
- You were there, not in some hospital.
- Hey, Son, don't worry about all that.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.371
All you have to worry about is how you
gonna bring that championship home.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.206
Understood?

04:50.957 --> 04:54.294
And all you have to worry about is paying
for this speeding ticket.

04:54.460 --> 04:59.132
- 'Sup, y'all? Got here as soon as I could.
- Late on your registration again, huh?

05:00.591 --> 05:01.718
We're not paying that.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.767
<i>If you own the night,</i>

05:09.934 --> 05:12.020
<i>but the stars refuse to come out and play,</i>

05:12.520 --> 05:14.564
<i>where do you go next
if you can't see the light?</i>

05:22.238 --> 05:25.658
<i>Every person is fated to face a day
when they can't go on.</i>

05:26.701 --> 05:30.163
<i>When nothing you can do
can possibly beat back the darkness.</i>

05:32.373 --> 05:33.666
What else could go wrong?

05:33.791 --> 05:36.336
A whole lot if your mama sees
a mess on that table

05:36.461 --> 05:37.795
before her and your dad get home.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.797
Now, bring your little tail down here.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.092
Ooh. I sound just like your grandma, huh?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.678
Look at this... It's like you guys want me

05:45.678 --> 05:47.680
- to get banned from this house again.
- Again?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.058
What'd you do to get banned
the first time?

05:50.808 --> 05:53.061
That's... That's grown folks' business.
Don't worry about that.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.562
Why does everybody keep saying that?

05:55.646 --> 05:58.066
Everybody's trying to box me and JB out
when it comes to Dad,

05:58.066 --> 05:59.275
when we could be helping.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.736
Boy, can't nobody use
your little cashew-shaped kidneys.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.613
Filthy's not talking about ours.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.823
He's talking about Kelli.

06:08.576 --> 06:12.705
That's not my place, JB.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.333
Neither Mom nor Dad have ever told us
exactly what went down.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.711
All right, look, I'll tell you this.
Chuck not being in Kelli's life

06:18.711 --> 06:20.963
was not his choice.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.674
Which is why we think she has the right
to know what's going on with him.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.802
He's her dad, too.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.348
- Not my place, man.
- Even if your best friend is dying?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.107
Look, I wouldn't even know
how to get ahold of her.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.194
We do. We found her on Instagram.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.115
What if she's not working today?

06:47.490 --> 06:49.117
Or what if she doesn't wanna
talk to us?

06:49.117 --> 06:51.077
I mean, she has to, right?

06:51.202 --> 06:52.703
Wouldn't you wanna know about Dad?

06:53.329 --> 06:55.706
Not everybody wants to be close
to their family.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.919
What's that you got right there?

07:00.545 --> 07:03.464
Uh. It's a letter JB and I wrote to Kelli
when we were seven.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.633
As soon as Mom and Dad told us
we had a sister,

07:05.633 --> 07:07.552
we ran upstairs and wrote a letter to her.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.762
Yeah. Figured now is the time
to give it to her.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.681
- Oh.
- We might not ever get another chance.

07:11.806 --> 07:17.770
Oh. Okay, we here. Jezebel's, huh?
Five ninety-nine for a hot chocolate?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.648
They better be back there
peeling them beans by hand.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.153
<i>Live, uh
Live a little bit</i>

07:25.278 --> 07:27.113
<i>Live, uh
Live a little, live a little bit</i>

07:27.113 --> 07:28.239
<i>Love you</i>

07:28.239 --> 07:30.283
<i>Live a little
Live a little bit....</i>

07:30.283 --> 07:31.993
- You guys ready to do this thing?
Yeah.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.119
Okay.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.249
Wow. These prices really are high, hmm?

07:39.542 --> 07:41.544
Hmm. There she is.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.052
Hi, welcome to Jezebel's.
Can I interest you in a pour-over?

07:50.052 --> 07:53.431
With these high prices, I might
have to take out a second mortgage first.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.682
Kelli?

07:56.100 --> 07:57.560
Yes.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.188
Look, we're sorry. It's just, um...

08:00.313 --> 08:02.940
Oh, no worries. Look, I know
the menu can be a little intimidating...

08:03.232 --> 08:08.237
Actually, we're here to talk to you
about our dad. We're Chuck Bell's sons.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.575
We're your brothers.

08:14.744 --> 08:15.953
How did y'all find me?

08:16.162 --> 08:19.207
Uh. We figured out where you work
and decided to give it a shot.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.292
I'm sorry, this just weird.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.254
I didn't expect to come into work
and meet my brothers and...

08:25.713 --> 08:26.714
Who are you?

08:27.131 --> 08:28.758
Oh, you can call me Uncle Skinny.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.426
- Bam! Put it right here.
- Not happening.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.636
Okay.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.388
- He's our dad's best friend.
- I'm... I'm just here for moral support.

08:34.388 --> 08:37.767
- So, I'll just shut up.
- This is a little weird for us, too.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.228
I mean, we've known about you
for a long time but...

08:40.228 --> 08:43.147
We had planned to be a bit older
before we contacted you.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.066
- So, what changed?
- It's Dad.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.195
He's sick, and it's bad.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.072
Is that why he called me the other day?

08:51.739 --> 08:54.283
I mean, he left me a message,
but he didn't say he was sick.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.538
We don't think he wanted you
to know just yet.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.040
Um. But we thought you should.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.710
You know,
considering that he's your dad, too.

09:08.297 --> 09:11.676
You think you'd ever want to meet him?
I mean, he's a great guy, coach, dad...

09:11.676 --> 09:13.803
I'm sorry. I don't know
what kind of father he is

09:13.803 --> 09:15.555
considering I have no memories of him.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.473
I didn't have the luxury
of knowing him like y'all do.

09:17.682 --> 09:21.561
Mm, okay. All right. Time out. Hey.
How about you guys go to the car?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.896
- Give me and Kelli a second, okay?
- What?

09:23.896 --> 09:26.357
Uh. Go... Go in the car, man.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.610
- Go, go. Go.
- It was nice meeting you.

09:30.361 --> 09:33.447
All right.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.742
It's nothing against the boys.
They seem super cool and super sweet.

09:36.867 --> 09:40.413
Yes, they are. And they're just trying
to do right by their father.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.124
You do realize Chuck was never in my life?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.167
My grandparents are the ones
who raised me.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.504
Chuck fought tooth and nail
for custody of you.

09:48.921 --> 09:52.383
The courts just thought
that your mom's parents had better means.

09:52.717 --> 09:56.596
That boy was young, though,
but he always loved you.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.931
And he always said that a piece
of his heart was missing,

09:58.931 --> 10:01.684
and that piece was you, Kelli.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.816
Sorry. This is a lot to process.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.076
It's from my nephews.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.039
Take care of yourself.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.767
Hey, so the rumors are true.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.477
- You're still alive.
- Hmm.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.813
God willing, man. Oh, boy.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.815
- Lots of bed rest.
Yeah.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.902
I appreciate you coming,
checking in on me.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.071
Of course. How else we gonna prep
for the big game, right?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.864
Yeah. Look, Gio...

10:58.407 --> 11:01.077
in case, I don't make it to the game,
if we're gonna win this,

11:01.369 --> 11:03.496
I need you to keep everybody's eye
on the prize.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.581
What do you mean,
"Not make it to the game"?

11:06.707 --> 11:07.792
I'm starting dialysis.

11:08.918 --> 11:09.919
I didn't know that.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.547
Uh, Coach, we can't play
the reigning champs without you.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.174
I mean, we've been prepping
for this all year.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.760
Gio, you gonna bring home
that championship

11:18.010 --> 11:19.428
'cause I'm gonna be watching.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.766
So, let's start prepping.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.353
All right, where we at?

11:38.781 --> 11:42.368
<i>Without you, I am empty
The goal with no net</i>

11:43.077 --> 11:46.539
<i>The double team is still on me
Like feathers on a bird</i>

11:46.789 --> 11:48.999
<i>Ever seen an eagle soar?</i>

11:49.417 --> 11:52.461
<i>Broken, shattered
Like puzzle pieces that no longer fit</i>

11:52.837 --> 11:54.130
<i>And that's when I remember</i>

11:55.506 --> 11:58.968
<i>My wings are gone</i>

12:09.019 --> 12:12.940
"The double team is still on me
like feathers on a bird.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.901
"Ever seen an eagle soar?

12:17.820 --> 12:21.282
"Broken, shattered like puzzle pieces
that no longer fit."

12:25.536 --> 12:26.579
Of course.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.457
Wait. Is that how you're feeling
about everything?

12:29.623 --> 12:32.042
I... I feel like everything
I've ever known

12:32.042 --> 12:36.046
is being yanked from underneath me.
Dad, basketball. What's next?

12:36.589 --> 12:39.508
Hey. I know you're going through
a lot right now.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.761
But just know you are not alone.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.680
I'll always be here for you, Filthy.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.683
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.530
-  Sorry to interrupt.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.073
Miss Rojas Pierre said,

13:03.073 --> 13:05.075
-"I have got to meet you."
- I... I gotta go.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.955
- You're Kwame Alexander?
- I am.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.041
But this, though...

13:12.541 --> 13:17.546
"And that's when I remember,
my wings are gone." You wrote this?

13:17.797 --> 13:21.926
Ye... Yeah. I'm... I'm kind of a writer.
What are you doing here?

13:22.092 --> 13:24.470
I surprised a teacher
with a new copy of my book.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.138
- It's... it's what I do.
Oh, yeah.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.432
- That's what's up, man. That's so cool.
- And so is this.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.893
But where did your wings go?

13:32.520 --> 13:33.521
Not sure.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.398
Unmoored maybe.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.276
- As in...
- Adrift.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.696
- Misplaced? Lost?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.324
Irretrievable.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.285
Come on. In my experience,

13:48.577 --> 13:52.498
the things you truly love,
they can't be taken away from you.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.918
We carry them in our hearts,
like moonlight over the sea.

13:56.544 --> 14:00.339
This thing you wrote, this is art.
Trust your words.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.302
They will take you as far as you let them.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.721
You feel me?

14:40.671 --> 14:45.259
JB. JB. JB. JB!

14:46.427 --> 14:50.306
- What are you doing out of class?
- Oh, hey. I didn't see you there.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.557
Obviously.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.643
- Where'd you go?
- I was in the zone.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.939
Had to get basketball out of my head.
All those new plays are crowding my brain.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.317
- Don't worry, JB, you got this.
- No, I don't.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.445
Yo, how am I gonna remember
all this stuff?

15:04.820 --> 15:06.822
I mean,
what if I forget or get distracted?

15:07.323 --> 15:09.033
You know focusing is not my strong point.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.951
That is not what it looked like
a moment ago.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.119
That's different.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.623
I remember. "There's no storm in my head
when I'm painting."

15:16.248 --> 15:17.333
There's a storm now.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.877
With my dad not coaching
and Filthy not playing,

15:19.877 --> 15:21.003
it's a whole new game.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.506
Even with taking my ADHD meds,
it's all still jumbled in my head.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.845
- You practiced the plays, right?
- Of course, I did. But still a blur.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.681
That's because you're in the storm.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.183
What?

15:34.975 --> 15:39.104
JB, what's messing with you right now,
is worry. Your thoughts are running wild.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.398
- School, your dad, this game.
- Yeah, but...

15:41.523 --> 15:46.528
But nothing.
Look, every storm has a calm center.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.031
I mean, just now, you were so focused
on your art,

15:49.031 --> 15:50.699
you didn't even know I was here.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.162
You remembered everything about the moment
you were putting on paper.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.956
Isn't that the same on the court?

15:57.081 --> 15:59.375
- When I know the plays.
- You do know the plays.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.211
- The storm is just a distraction.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.673
Then when you're playing, remember,
the court is your center.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.549
It's the eye of the storm.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.761
And stop worrying about forgetting.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.721
That hyper focus you got,

16:12.888 --> 16:15.391
that is your superpower, Jordan Bell.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.064
Whoo. Boy, that driver was crazy.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.149
Dropped my nephews off
in the French Quarter,

16:24.400 --> 16:25.609
let 'em fend for themselves.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.696
But a brother is hungry.
Are you good?

16:28.862 --> 16:30.322
- Hmm.
- You want...

16:32.866 --> 16:33.867
Okay.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.621
- You're not good.
- Uh. Bro.

16:37.830 --> 16:42.501
- Is it the treatment, the doctors, or...
- Bro, this goes beyond...

16:44.044 --> 16:46.130
any fear that I have of doctors.

16:46.714 --> 16:47.798
This is me.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.426
I did not make the right choices.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.220
For Crystal, for my boys.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.389
You can't change your past plays.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.434
Just gotta learn from 'em.
All right, you taught me that.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.232
All right, so, what are today's moves?

17:05.774 --> 17:08.736
Today's moves is...

17:09.153 --> 17:11.989
..."Chuck, do what the doctor said."

17:13.615 --> 17:15.367
- Okay, and?
- And...

17:18.287 --> 17:19.747
I'm not sure about that yet.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.500
Okay, well, we gotta work
with what we've been given.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.420
Okay, both good and the bad.
And right now,

17:26.545 --> 17:27.921
you looking at a second chance.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.006
Skinny...

17:30.007 --> 17:32.926
a life on dialysis,
that's my second chance.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.012
No, no, no, no, no.
I think another day spent

17:35.137 --> 17:37.097
with your family is your second chance.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.643
And asking for help is never a weakness.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.480
All right.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.775
You can't always go at it alone, Chuck.
You know that.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.113
Bro, I'm scared.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.159
And I don't want to leave them like this.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.540
You promise me
that if anything ever happened to me...

18:03.749 --> 18:06.376
I... I promise you, I will wait

18:06.835 --> 18:10.339
a respectful amount of time
after your funeral

18:10.547 --> 18:13.425
- to marry your wife. I... I got you.
- Wow.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.512
- I got you, Chuck.
- You must have forgot

18:16.512 --> 18:18.514
the last whooping I gave you.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.724
I got you, I got you. You know I got you.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.894
Look, seriously,
you know this isn't permanent.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.521
All right?

18:26.271 --> 18:27.856
You want to make moves? Yeah?

18:27.981 --> 18:29.483
Yeah. Okay, all right. Cool.

18:30.192 --> 18:34.196
Well then... start with your treatment.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.908
- Start with your treatment.
- Yeah.

18:37.908 --> 18:43.455
Because if I know one thing,
for better or worse, them boys need you.

18:51.046 --> 18:54.591
Hey, hey, hey. You heard the man.
The rules have not changed.

18:54.591 --> 18:57.761
One hundred free throws.
And you were on 78.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.388
All right, new rule.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.349
For every shot I make,
you give me the real on Dad.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.894
Mm-mm. Your father wants you to focus
on the game, not him.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.484
You mean my game.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.862
You're worried about carrying the team
without your brother?

19:16.196 --> 19:18.365
JB, you're just as good as Filthy.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.077
If not better, but now,
it feels like it's all on me.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.788
You're forgetting you got a whole team
of brothers beside you.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.208
Vondie, for starters.
You're not in this alone, JB.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.170
But I'm still playing without
my ride or die. My clutch.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.134
You spend too much time focusing
on what could go wrong

19:37.134 --> 19:40.596
instead of what could go right.
So, what could go right?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.390
- I could make all my free throws.
- Okay.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.020
All right.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.355
What else?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.275
I could break a few ankles.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.943
Ah, they gonna need some wraps, huh?

19:54.943 --> 19:56.195
- Yeah.
- What else?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.113
I could take my team
to a championship win.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.199
All right, that's what I like to hear.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.618
You not winning no championships
taking it up like that.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.953
- Filthy.
- That's clearly the suspension talking,

20:04.953 --> 20:06.997
- so I'm gonna let it slide.
- Right.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.293
You think you know your brother's game
pretty well, huh?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.337
Better than my own sometimes.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.381
So, why don't you tell him
and the rest of the team from the bench?

20:17.174 --> 20:18.884
- What you mean?
- I said you were suspended

20:18.884 --> 20:19.968
from playing the game.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.387
But I never said
you couldn't help your team.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.609
To be honest, I don't know
what reaction I was expecting from Kelli.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.777
Can you blame her?

20:36.902 --> 20:38.695
Yeah, we kinda did just pop up at her job.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.697
- You think we should apologize?
Couldn't hurt.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.283
I really don't wanna have screwed up
Dad's last chance with Kelli.

20:43.992 --> 20:44.993
Who's Kelli?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.539
Ah, um...

20:49.831 --> 20:52.042
A story for another day, big man.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.838
Good. Need I remind you, today's game day,

20:57.005 --> 20:58.507
which means we gotta be focused up.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.426
JB, say Coach Gio draws up
that new 3B play.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.096
I hit the post, uh, wait for the screen,

21:04.221 --> 21:06.390
cut the lane then pop back out
for the baseline shot, right?

21:06.390 --> 21:07.641
- Wrong, dude.
- What?

21:08.392 --> 21:10.394
Thought I had it.
Filthy, what'd I miss?

21:11.311 --> 21:14.106
- Filthy? Filthy!
- Huh? Huh?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.276
Y'all two good?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.195
Yeah, sure. Why not?

21:20.904 --> 21:22.656
- They're scaring me, JB.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.326
Hey, y'all go ahead.
Me and Filthy will catch up.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.412
- All right, man.
- All right.

21:31.206 --> 21:34.710
Yo. Do you think I am stupid?
What's going on with you and Maya?

21:34.876 --> 21:37.421
- Why something gotta be up?
- All right, fine. Don't tell me.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.590
Just know that change doesn't always
have to be a secret or scary.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.884
Sometimes, it could be the change
you didn't know you needed.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.555
Wow. You've been listening to Drake again,
haven't you?

21:46.972 --> 21:47.973
Shut up.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.727
Hey, I'm just saying,
it might be making you a little bit soft.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.233
<i>Hey, I move different</i>

21:58.483 --> 21:59.526
<i>Whoo!</i>

22:01.361 --> 22:02.404
<i>Hey</i>

22:02.946 --> 22:05.532
<i>I move different, I shine different...</i>

22:06.199 --> 22:07.409
I got your back, bro.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.329
You're interrupting my meditation.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.664
I don't remember
Coach Gio implementing leg bouncing

22:12.664 --> 22:13.957
in our pre-game meditation.

22:14.916 --> 22:15.917
I'm trying to focus, man.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.630
Look, like I said, I got your back.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.596
Look.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.307
Isn't it beautiful?

22:30.766 --> 22:32.017
Poetry ain't it, Filthy.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.144
Just wait for it.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.730
<i>Voilà!</i>

22:39.191 --> 22:43.028
Boom. Filthy McNasty's playbook.

22:43.362 --> 22:47.074
It's lyrical, empirical,
every play inside it is critical,

22:47.074 --> 22:50.827
and for you and the teammates...
...a miracle.

22:52.829 --> 22:53.830
"Shaking and faking"?

22:55.665 --> 22:56.875
"Paint in ya face"?

22:58.710 --> 23:00.587
- Mnemonics.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.590
<i>As in connected sounds</i>

23:03.840 --> 23:07.511
<i>As in sound connected to action</i>

23:08.637 --> 23:13.058
<i>Easy to remember and not get distracted
ADHD is your superpower</i>

23:13.058 --> 23:16.561
<i>All I did was put it onto paper
And throw you the lob</i>

23:17.938 --> 23:18.939
<i>Now look</i>

23:18.939 --> 23:21.024
<i>You've always been a GOAT
From the three</i>

23:21.149 --> 23:23.902
<i>So, shakin' and fakin' is like play B3</i>

23:23.902 --> 23:29.449
<i>Only instead, you're not going
To the hole like me, you fake in</i>

23:29.449 --> 23:30.534
<i>Step out, and...</i>

23:31.618 --> 23:32.911
<i>Pop that three</i>

23:37.874 --> 23:40.252
"Flexis Alexis"?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.170
Yeah, I knew you're gonna pay attention
to that one.

23:42.879 --> 23:46.967
So, when you... you send up
that alley-oop to Vondie,

23:46.967 --> 23:48.593
who's flying so high...

23:49.553 --> 23:53.557
which is exactly how you feel
when Alexis smiles at you.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.186
What's so funny? Did I spell Alexis wrong?

23:58.979 --> 24:01.481
This is so like you, man.
You can't be on the court,

24:01.481 --> 24:03.775
so you make sure your rhymes
is still in my head during the game.

24:03.775 --> 24:06.194
I was just trying to help, you know?

24:06.194 --> 24:07.988
Make sure you remembered
and you get focused.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.534
You did it, bro.
This is perfect. I love it.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.206
Hurry up, we gotta go!

24:19.291 --> 24:24.129
Oh, okay! I like to see it. That energy.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.339
You all decked out to support
your team, huh?

24:26.339 --> 24:28.675
Actually, I'm staying back.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.012
I want to be with Dad
on his first treatment.

24:32.012 --> 24:36.266
Hmm. Yeah, I tried to talk it out of him,
but you know, that's your son.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.311
Well, some things are bigger
than basketball.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.980
Oh, okay. Can't say that I thought
I'd ever see the day.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.609
Well, you have raised two fine,
young gentlemen.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.987
- No. We raised two fine, young gentlemen.
- You're right about that.

24:49.112 --> 24:52.949
- All right, JB... all eyes on you, my guy.
- I'm ready for it.

24:54.409 --> 24:56.536
- We're gonna miss you at the game.
- Hey, I'll be watching.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.414
Now, tell Gio lay off on the meditation.

24:59.539 --> 25:01.541
I don't want my team falling asleep
on the bench.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.919
- I will pass along the message.
- Okay.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.838
Hurry up, let's go, JB.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.552
You got this.
- No, we got this.

25:17.807 --> 25:18.808
- Oh.
