WEBVTT

00:02.520 --> 00:03.550
- Thank you, Margaret.

00:03.590 --> 00:05.390
- You're welcome, Raymond.

00:06.660 --> 00:08.390
- Seamus Murphy.
- That's right.

00:08.430 --> 00:11.100
Remember how I saved
your detectives from prison

00:11.130 --> 00:12.230
in exchange for a favor?

00:12.260 --> 00:13.830
- The time has come...
- Wait.

00:13.860 --> 00:15.370
- This isn't my order.
- What?

00:15.400 --> 00:17.200
- This is an omelet.
I only eat omelets on vacation.

00:17.230 --> 00:18.540
- Yeah, I don't care
what you eat.

00:18.570 --> 00:21.270
I'm here to call in
the favor that you owe me.

00:21.310 --> 00:22.540
- Really?

00:22.570 --> 00:24.440
What if I say no?

00:24.470 --> 00:26.080
- This is you
asking me for Intel

00:26.110 --> 00:27.410
and promising to pay me back.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.350
How do you think
this would look to your bosses,

00:29.380 --> 00:32.119
especially now that you're up
for the commissioner job?

00:32.150 --> 00:34.380
Yeah. I know everything.

00:34.420 --> 00:35.490
- So...

00:35.520 --> 00:36.620
what do you want from me?

00:39.390 --> 00:41.330
- A permit
to throw a block party?

00:41.360 --> 00:42.630
We don't even
have to break the law.

00:42.660 --> 00:44.290
This is fantastic news.

00:44.330 --> 00:46.160
- I am not giving Seamus Murphy
that permit.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.630
He only wants to use
the block party

00:47.660 --> 00:49.270
as a cover
for something criminal:

00:49.300 --> 00:51.440
a robbery, a murder,
or something worse.

00:51.470 --> 00:53.440
- You don't know that for sure,
and that's your loophole.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.170
- I don't believe in loopholes.
- What? Loopholes are the best.

00:56.210 --> 00:57.670
Remember that time
when Pancake Palace had

00:57.710 --> 00:59.640
that all-you-can-eat deal, but
they didn't set a time limit?

00:59.680 --> 01:02.380
I ate pancakes for a week
for $3.99.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.410
All I had to do was sleep there
and never shower.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.420
- What?
Thanks for the invite, friend.

01:06.450 --> 01:08.250
- I will not be using
a loophole, Peralta.

01:08.290 --> 01:10.190
As always,
I'll be using the main hole

01:10.220 --> 01:12.220
or no hole. I choose no hole.

01:12.260 --> 01:13.890
- You just said "hole"
way too much, sir.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.590
- And that's coming
from Charles.

01:15.630 --> 01:16.890
- Yes, that's concerning.

01:16.930 --> 01:18.630
- Ugh, you think you know
someone, Jake.

01:18.660 --> 01:19.660
Unbelievable!

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:39.680 --> 01:42.150
- Captain, we think
we found a way for you

01:42.190 --> 01:43.690
to do Murphy the favor
and still live with yourself.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.460
- Sounds like a loophole.

01:45.490 --> 01:48.190
- Nope, we found the main hole,
and it is open for business.

01:48.230 --> 01:50.190
- Oh, gross.
- Yep, sorry. Look.

01:50.230 --> 01:51.460
You don't want to give
Murphy the permit

01:51.500 --> 01:53.230
because you're afraid
he's gonna use it as a cover

01:53.260 --> 01:54.630
for something illegal,
but what if we figured out

01:54.660 --> 01:57.330
what he was up to and could
stop him before he did it?

01:57.370 --> 01:59.400
That way you could give him a
permit with a clean conscience.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.370
- Well, how are you gonna
find out what his real plan is?

02:01.410 --> 02:03.370
He's smart, and he doesn't talk
to anyone but his family.

02:03.410 --> 02:04.470
- I was worried about that, too,

02:04.510 --> 02:05.610
but that's when I remembered:

02:05.640 --> 02:06.610
"The Godfather."

02:06.640 --> 02:08.210
- The Diane Keaton movie.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.410
- No one refers to it as that,

02:09.449 --> 02:11.220
but Charles is right,
she is in it.

02:11.250 --> 02:12.350
- This isn't one of your
movie plans, is it?

02:12.380 --> 02:14.480
- First of all, if we had
developed a "Minority Report"

02:14.520 --> 02:16.390
style pre-crime division
like I suggested,

02:16.420 --> 02:18.390
we wouldn't be in this Seamus
mess, and it's not just because

02:18.420 --> 02:19.690
I wanted to go like this,
although I did.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.660
But secondly,
in "The Godfather,"

02:21.690 --> 02:23.690
Don Corleone had three sons:
Michael, his favorite...

02:23.730 --> 02:24.960
- Diane Keaton's husband.
- Mm-Kay.

02:24.990 --> 02:26.300
Then there was Sonny,
the hothead.

02:26.330 --> 02:27.430
- Diane Keaton's brother-in-law.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.400
- Charles,
you're being distracting.

02:29.430 --> 02:31.300
- No, he's not, he's actually
helping me to follow this.

02:31.340 --> 02:32.600
Continue going through
Diane Keaton's relatives.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.810
- Fine, Diane Keaton's
other brother-in-law is Fredo,

02:35.840 --> 02:37.440
the screw-up, the weak link.

02:37.470 --> 02:39.540
- And you think the Murphys
have a Fredo?

02:39.580 --> 02:41.280
- Every family does,
and in this family,

02:41.310 --> 02:42.480
his name is Kyle.

02:42.510 --> 02:43.810
- Is he on a roller coaster?
- Yes.

02:43.850 --> 02:45.420
It's his driver's license
photo somehow.

02:45.450 --> 02:47.220
- He's never had a job,
he took six years

02:47.250 --> 02:49.650
to graduate high school,
and his father paid $200,000

02:49.690 --> 02:51.990
so he could attend
the University of Arizona.

02:52.020 --> 02:53.460
- Lake Havasu campus.

02:53.490 --> 02:55.430
Sir, this kid is a disaster.

02:55.460 --> 02:56.730
If there's anyone
that's gonna give us info

02:56.760 --> 02:58.700
on the Murphy family
and slip up, it's Kyle.

02:58.730 --> 03:01.430
- Okay, but if you don't
figure out what his plan is,

03:01.470 --> 03:03.300
I don't give him that permit.

03:03.330 --> 03:04.430
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

03:04.470 --> 03:06.240
- All right, go make contact

03:06.270 --> 03:08.240
with Diane Keaton's
brother-in-law.

03:08.270 --> 03:09.510
- Fredo. It's Fredo.

03:09.540 --> 03:10.710
It's one of the most popular
movies of all time.

03:10.740 --> 03:13.240
Won best picture, so.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.810
- Ready for a kick-ass
assignment?

03:14.840 --> 03:16.010
- Hell yeah.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.420
Let's do this.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.320
Wait, what do you mean
by "kick-ass"?

03:22.350 --> 03:23.750
- Holt wants us to get
that block party permit.

03:23.790 --> 03:25.360
- Damn it.

03:25.390 --> 03:26.590
I guess I'll take the knife
out of my pants.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.730
- No, come on, Rosa.
It'll be so cool.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.030
We get to go to SAPO,

03:30.060 --> 03:31.560
the Street Activity
Permit Office.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.760
It is the oldest continuously
operating permit office

03:34.800 --> 03:36.030
in the state.

03:36.070 --> 03:37.430
- Pass. Find somebody else.

03:37.470 --> 03:38.770
- But we promised
to help Captain Holt.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.040
Look, it'll be quick.

03:40.070 --> 03:42.340
We'll just go,
get Murphy his permit,

03:42.370 --> 03:44.410
and maybe grab a few shots
for the 'Gram.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.740
They have the original permits
for the 1939 World's Fair.

03:47.780 --> 03:48.810
- No.
- Yes!

03:48.850 --> 03:50.480
- No.
- Yes!

03:50.510 --> 03:51.820
- No, I mean,
"No, I don't want to do this."

03:51.850 --> 03:54.350
- No, yeah, come on.
We're gonna do it.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.290
- Hey, Gina.
How's it feel to be back?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.320
- Any trouble adjusting?
- Adjusting to what?

03:59.360 --> 04:00.460
- To life as a working mom.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.860
You have to juggle the baby,

04:01.890 --> 04:03.560
the job, your new business.

04:03.590 --> 04:05.530
- Terry, juggling isn't hard.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.370
That's why the salary
for jugglers is so low.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.900
Name one rich juggler.

04:09.930 --> 04:11.340
- Doesn't Dave Coulier juggle?

04:11.370 --> 04:12.700
- If you're reaching
for Coulier,

04:12.740 --> 04:14.700
then you've already
lost the argument, Terr-Bear.

04:14.740 --> 04:16.540
But there is one thing:

04:16.570 --> 04:18.380
I need a private place
where I can pump.

04:18.410 --> 04:20.380
I was thinking maybe
I could take this whole floor

04:20.410 --> 04:22.350
and you guys could move down
to that place where we park.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.480
- The garage?

04:23.510 --> 04:24.710
- Sure, if you think that works.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.080
- Well, there's an empty office
behind records.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.390
It's nice and quiet.

04:28.420 --> 04:29.690
We can put in a comfy chair,

04:29.720 --> 04:30.790
maybe a mini fridge.

04:30.820 --> 04:32.620
- Uh, that would
be a no-go, Sarge.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.460
- That's our nap room.
- She needs to pump.

04:34.490 --> 04:35.890
- The room is hers.
- Whoa.

04:35.930 --> 04:37.830
That escalated fast.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.830
- Okay.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.100
There's our Fredo.

04:40.130 --> 04:41.400
He comes in here every day

04:41.430 --> 04:42.530
at noon, for some reason.

04:42.570 --> 04:44.330
- Hey, change the channel, dude.

04:44.370 --> 04:45.400
"Finding Bigfoot" is starting.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.770
- All right, let's go over
our covers one more time.

04:48.810 --> 04:49.910
We are small-time operators

04:49.940 --> 04:51.410
that just moved here from Miami.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.540
We piloted go-fast boats,

04:52.580 --> 04:53.710
moving contraband to Cuba.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.480
- Where we slept
with the same prostitute.

04:55.510 --> 04:56.580
- No.
- And she said you were

04:56.610 --> 04:57.880
the best she ever had. - Maybe.

04:57.910 --> 04:59.620
- And I should
watch you to learn.

04:59.650 --> 05:01.490
- Back to no... let's just
not talk about our sex lives.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.650
All right, we've got a week,

05:02.690 --> 05:04.420
so we can ease our way
into this thing.

05:04.450 --> 05:05.820
Let's not blow it
by engaging right away.

05:05.860 --> 05:07.590
Oh, no. We made eye contact.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.460
He's coming over here.
We're engaging right away.

05:09.490 --> 05:11.760
- Hey, what's going on?

05:11.800 --> 05:12.860
I saw you guys staring at me.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.530
- What? No, no, no, no, no.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.570
We were just looking
at the TV behind you.

05:15.600 --> 05:16.870
We love "Finding Bigfoot."

05:16.900 --> 05:18.470
- It's our favorite show.
- Yeah.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.700
- I mean, why haven't they
caught him yet, right?

05:19.740 --> 05:21.640
- Totally.

05:21.670 --> 05:23.440
I mean, he's so big.
You'd think it'd be easy.

05:23.470 --> 05:24.710
- Yeah.
- Yes.

05:24.740 --> 05:26.910
- Oh, my God, I'm feeling
a real connection here.

05:26.940 --> 05:27.980
Should we hang out sometime,

05:28.010 --> 05:29.410
or am I being crazy?

05:29.450 --> 05:30.810
- You're not being crazy, Kyle.

05:32.020 --> 05:34.150
- How do you know my name?

05:34.180 --> 05:35.790
- Because we're so connected.

05:35.820 --> 05:37.720
- Oh!

05:37.750 --> 05:39.490
- Yes!
- What?

05:42.790 --> 05:43.790
- So, this is my pad.

05:43.830 --> 05:44.930
TV room, recording studio

05:44.960 --> 05:46.460
where I lay down my raps.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.070
And this is where
the magic happens.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.530
It's where I practice
doing magic.

05:50.570 --> 05:52.040
- Oh, so literally, then.

05:52.070 --> 05:53.870
- Love all the lamps.
- Thanks.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.810
I accidentally ordered
100 lamps instead of one.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.140
They only give you, like,
a six-month return window, so.

05:58.170 --> 05:59.740
- You get it.
- Totally.

05:59.780 --> 06:00.740
Man, this place is huge.

06:00.780 --> 06:02.010
How do you afford it?

06:02.050 --> 06:04.450
Do you have, like, a great job
or family money?

06:04.480 --> 06:06.750
- Yeah, lots of it, I'm part
of the Murphy crime family.

06:06.780 --> 06:08.080
- Oh.
- Aw, damn it.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.190
I am not supposed to say that.

06:10.220 --> 06:12.090
We're not a crime family, okay?

06:12.120 --> 06:15.090
- We're a cream family.
- Dude, it's fine.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.190
Honestly, we're also
involved in... cream.

06:18.230 --> 06:20.430
- Organized cream.
- Cool, cool.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.930
- Hey, just checking...
you guys mean crime, right?

06:22.970 --> 06:24.770
- Yes.
- Okay, good, right, go on.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.870
- Well, we're actually looking
for some work right now.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.540
We just got into town
from Miami.

06:28.570 --> 06:30.440
- Where we didn't sleep
with the same prostitute.

06:30.470 --> 06:33.110
- Yes, anyways, do you think
your family needs any help?

06:33.140 --> 06:35.080
- Any big jobs coming up?
- Uh, wouldn't know.

06:35.110 --> 06:36.510
They don't tell me anything.
They're mad at me.

06:36.550 --> 06:37.380
- What? Why?

06:37.410 --> 06:39.120
- I used to drive
for my uncle Seamus.

06:39.150 --> 06:40.550
One day, he had this big
cream meeting...

06:40.580 --> 06:42.120
- We don't have to keep
doing that.

06:42.150 --> 06:43.790
- Okay, cool.
He was torturing some guy.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.860
Anyway, I was waiting
in his favorite car,

06:45.890 --> 06:47.120
a white 1980 Rolls-Royce,

06:47.160 --> 06:48.860
but he was taking forever,

06:48.890 --> 06:51.460
so I decided to go catch
a matinee of "Suicide Squad."

06:51.500 --> 06:53.060
- And he was pissed
that you drove off in the car?

06:53.100 --> 06:54.800
- No, obviously I left
the Rolls there

06:54.830 --> 06:56.070
with the keys in the ignition
in case he needed it,

06:56.100 --> 06:57.470
but guess what happened?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.600
- It got stolen.
- Oh, my God.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.140
- How'd you guys know?
- We're just connected, Kyle.

07:02.170 --> 07:04.810
- Team Bigfoot.
- Team Bigfoot!

07:04.840 --> 07:07.240
- Anyway, they kicked me out of
the family business for good.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.480
Apparently, I'm a "liability"
and "worthless" and "Kyle."

07:11.520 --> 07:14.150
The last one is just my name,
but you should hear their tone.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.890
- So, you don't know
about anything

07:16.920 --> 07:18.050
that's going down at all?

07:18.090 --> 07:19.590
- No, but if you know anyone

07:19.620 --> 07:21.560
who's looking to buy a lamp
for really cheap,

07:21.590 --> 07:22.330
I know a guy.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.160
- Oh, Kyle.
- Yeah, that's it.

07:24.190 --> 07:25.600
That's how they say it.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.230
This is taking forever.

07:28.260 --> 07:30.170
Can't you just forge
the signatures?

07:30.200 --> 07:32.500
- I'm a notary, Rosa.

07:32.540 --> 07:34.040
You can't say stuff like that
around me.

07:34.070 --> 07:35.540
I could lose my stamp over that.

07:35.570 --> 07:37.170
- I've never met anyone
who cares so much

07:37.210 --> 07:38.840
about stupid bureaucracy.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.280
- Bureaucracy is not stupid.

07:40.310 --> 07:41.610
It's elegant.

07:41.650 --> 07:43.980
It's a beautiful puzzle

07:44.010 --> 07:45.280
waiting to be cracked.

07:45.310 --> 07:48.950
Every rule, every form
has its purpose.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.920
It all fits together,

07:50.950 --> 07:52.520
and when the puzzle is solved

07:52.560 --> 07:54.860
and you take a step back
and see the big picture,

07:54.890 --> 07:57.960
it's like staring into
the face of God.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.100
- Hey.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.230
- We moved up a spot.
- Oh.

08:01.260 --> 08:03.870
- You seem like a real nerd.

08:04.870 --> 08:06.940
- Hello, Muriel.

08:06.970 --> 08:08.270
Another day in paradise?

08:08.300 --> 08:10.170
- She actually means that.
Please don't be offended.

08:10.210 --> 08:11.310
- Great. What do you want?

08:11.340 --> 08:13.080
- To apply
for a block party permit.

08:13.110 --> 08:14.880
Here is form 1290.

08:14.910 --> 08:17.180
- Oh, wait, you trying to get
a permit for this Friday?

08:17.210 --> 08:18.210
You would need...

08:18.250 --> 08:19.980
- 1290-B expedited request

08:20.020 --> 08:23.090
and a 1021-J adjustment waiver

08:23.120 --> 08:26.220
and a sweet, sweet
P-28-P supplemental.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.260
- Right.
There's just one problem.

08:28.290 --> 08:31.260
- What? No.
I did absolutely everything.

08:31.290 --> 08:33.230
- The 1021-J has to be submitted

08:33.260 --> 08:34.960
with an approved 1290.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.940
- But I'm submitting the 1021-J
to get the 1290 approved.

08:39.970 --> 08:42.240
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I guess it doesn't.

08:42.270 --> 08:45.110
- Okay. Okay, okay.

08:45.140 --> 08:48.010
This is just a puzzle,
and I can figure it out.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.110
To get an approved 1290,

08:50.150 --> 08:52.250
I need an approved 1021-J,

08:52.280 --> 08:54.580
which I can't get without
an approved 1290,

08:54.620 --> 08:56.620
which I can't get
without an approved 1021-J,

08:56.650 --> 08:58.620
which I can't get without
an approved 1290,

08:58.660 --> 09:00.620
which I can't get
without an approved 1021-J,

09:00.660 --> 09:02.230
which I can't get without
an approved 1290,

09:02.260 --> 09:04.130
which I can't get
without an approved 1021-J...

09:04.160 --> 09:05.700
- Okay. She's in a loop.

09:05.730 --> 09:07.360
You broke her brain.
I'm gonna take her out of here.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.930
- Which I can't get
without an approved 1290,

09:08.970 --> 09:10.300
which I can't get without...

09:10.330 --> 09:13.270
- Sarge, Hitchcock and I
just uncovered something huge.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.700
- You solved a crime?
- What?

09:14.740 --> 09:16.640
That's insane, no.
It's about our nap room.

09:16.670 --> 09:18.170
- Guess how long
Gina's been pumping for?

09:18.210 --> 09:20.010
- I don't want to...
- The last hour.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.140
- Now, everyone knows
Gina's using

09:21.180 --> 09:22.650
a Nodella Harmony Breastpump

09:22.680 --> 09:24.050
with 2-Phase
Expression Technology

09:24.080 --> 09:25.680
for faster milk expression.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.380
- You shouldn't know so much
about breastpumps, Hitchcock.

09:27.420 --> 09:28.720
- Well,
you should know more about

09:28.750 --> 09:30.290
what's going on
in your precinct.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.260
- Given the Nodella's
exceptional flow,

09:32.290 --> 09:34.020
there's no way she needs
to be pumping

09:34.060 --> 09:35.390
more than 20 minutes a side.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.360
- Wow, you didn't even
say "breast."

09:37.390 --> 09:39.160
- Yeah, because I'm not a child.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.700
I need my afternoon nap.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.970
- Okay, what are you guys
trying to say?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.300
- Come with us.

09:44.330 --> 09:46.170
- Where's Gina?

09:46.200 --> 09:48.200
- She just left the pump
running and disappeared.

09:48.240 --> 09:51.680
- You got played so hard.
- You cuck.

09:51.710 --> 09:54.280
- So, did you make contact
with Murphy's weak link?

09:54.310 --> 09:55.750
- Diane Keaton's brother-in-law?
- Yes.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.410
We're real tight,
but unfortunately,

09:57.450 --> 09:59.350
he's such a weak link, his
family won't tell him anything.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.020
- So... that's it, then.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.650
We have no idea what
Murphy's really up to?

10:02.690 --> 10:05.290
I can't morally give him
that permit, so it's over.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.990
- Wait. We still have time.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.160
Maybe there's a way to get Kyle
back in with his family.

10:09.190 --> 10:10.660
Like, what if...

10:10.690 --> 10:12.230
- Ooh,
Jake's wheels are turning.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.430
Your brain baby is crowning.

10:13.460 --> 10:15.200
- Boyle, please.
That's disgusting.

10:15.230 --> 10:17.200
- No, it's helping.
I am having a brain baby.

10:17.230 --> 10:19.200
- Then push, man, push.
- Breathe.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.400
- You can do this.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.410
You are so strong. - Ah, got it!

10:22.440 --> 10:24.440
Kyle's uncle cut him off
because of that stolen car,

10:24.470 --> 10:26.180
right, but what if
we could find that car

10:26.210 --> 10:27.740
and have Kyle
give it back to him?

10:27.780 --> 10:29.280
- Then all is forgiven.
Kyle's back in the family.

10:29.310 --> 10:31.010
- Right, but how
do we find that car?

10:31.050 --> 10:32.450
- We just did a big sweep
of Brooklyn chop shops.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.220
Maybe Seamus's car
is one of them.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.690
Maybe it's in the impound lot.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.090
- Yes.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.730
Okay. Put in my password.

10:43.460 --> 10:45.360
Yes, it's in the impound lot!

10:45.390 --> 10:46.730
My brain baby's a genius.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.130
It's a miracle.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.470
- Who's this lady we're meeting?

10:49.500 --> 10:51.700
- The source: Florence Tinj.

10:51.740 --> 10:54.140
She ran the rules and regs
department for 30 years.

10:54.170 --> 10:55.440
She wrote the forms.

10:55.470 --> 10:58.440
She has touched every life
in this city.

10:58.470 --> 11:00.240
- Not mine.
- Yeah-huh.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.480
Haven't you ever filled out
a mileage reimbursement form?

11:02.510 --> 11:04.010
- No, dude,
I make you do those for me.

11:04.050 --> 11:05.780
- Right, I'm so grateful
to you for that.

11:05.820 --> 11:07.720
Anyway, she's the only person
that can figure this out.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.290
She understands the bureaucracy

11:09.320 --> 11:12.260
on a level that we mortals
can't even fathom.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.260
Florence Tinj.

11:17.290 --> 11:18.860
- What?

11:18.900 --> 11:21.800
- Detectives Diaz
and Santiago, NYPD,

11:21.830 --> 11:23.170
and I just want to say...

11:25.100 --> 11:26.170
Those cats are having sex.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.400
- Yeah.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.740
- Uh, can you explain
these forms to us?

11:28.770 --> 11:30.410
- They seem logically flawed.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.140
At first,
I thought it was a mistake,

11:32.180 --> 11:35.080
but then I thought, "There's
something deeper at play here."

11:35.110 --> 11:36.150
- No, it's a mistake.

11:36.180 --> 11:37.210
- They don't work.
- What?

11:37.250 --> 11:38.510
But you wouldn't design a form

11:38.550 --> 11:40.280
that literally can't be filed.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.050
- Yeah, I would.
I did it all the time,

11:42.090 --> 11:44.820
mostly out of spite,
but also incompetence.

11:44.850 --> 11:47.290
Plus, I just found out
I'm dyslexic.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.860
- Okay. Thank you for your time.

11:48.890 --> 11:50.390
Good luck with all your, uh,
hoarding, Florence.

11:52.260 --> 11:53.800
- Okay.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.500
We're supposed to pick up Kyle
in a minute.

11:55.530 --> 11:57.200
We can't just bring him
straight to his uncle's Rolls,

11:57.230 --> 11:58.770
or it'll seem suspicious,
so we gotta figure out

11:58.800 --> 12:00.200
a way to make him
notice it on his own.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.370
- What if you drive by
and I yell,

12:01.400 --> 12:02.840
"Those two birds
are having sex!"

12:02.870 --> 12:04.310
He'll obviously
want to see that,

12:04.340 --> 12:05.310
and when he looks, voilà.

12:05.340 --> 12:06.540
The car's right there.

12:06.580 --> 12:08.510
- Or I could just drive by it
very slowly.

12:08.540 --> 12:10.780
- Ah, also a good plan.
- Okay, let's do it.

12:10.810 --> 12:13.550
- So, that's when it hits me:
savory dinner cereal.

12:13.580 --> 12:16.190
- Oh, my God.
- What?

12:16.220 --> 12:19.190
- Instead of it being cold,
what if I heat it up?

12:19.220 --> 12:20.460
Unless... is that just soup?

12:20.490 --> 12:22.460
- It is.
- You know what?

12:22.490 --> 12:23.930
I think I left my wallet
at home.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.800
- I'm just gonna turn around.
- Dude, look.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.130
My favorite gamer
just uploaded a new vid,

12:29.170 --> 12:30.200
and his mom is in this one.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.840
Then Tom Cruise hang glides in
with a machine gun

12:33.870 --> 12:36.140
and he's like,
"This is my party now!"

12:38.210 --> 12:39.910
Anyway, if I could make a movie,

12:39.940 --> 12:40.840
that's how it would start.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.380
- Kyle, look, two birds
are having sex!

12:43.410 --> 12:45.480
- What? Where?
Aw, man, I missed it.

12:45.510 --> 12:47.350
- Well, let's just
turn around again.

12:47.380 --> 12:48.420
- Where are those birds?

12:48.450 --> 12:50.250
Still no humping birds. Damn it.

12:50.290 --> 12:51.550
We're never
gonna see those birds.

12:51.590 --> 12:53.820
- Look behind that
1980 white Rolls Royce.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.160
- Ugh, I wish that stupid car
would move.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.490
- Kyle,
isn't that your uncle's car?

12:58.530 --> 13:01.360
- Oh, my God. Dude!

13:01.400 --> 13:03.270
I did it.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.330
I found it.
I found my uncle's car.

13:05.370 --> 13:08.140
Victory dance, whoo!

13:08.170 --> 13:09.870
- Oh, no, wait, stop!
Don't dance in the...

13:12.440 --> 13:15.140
- Oh, Fredo.
- I think I got hit!

13:18.880 --> 13:20.220
- Okay. Why are you barefoot?

13:20.250 --> 13:22.590
- I'm violating
uniform conduct code 773

13:22.620 --> 13:24.590
because the rules are pointless

13:24.620 --> 13:27.190
because they were written
by a hoarder who doesn't care.

13:27.220 --> 13:29.190
- Same here. Fight the power.

13:29.230 --> 13:30.890
- We can't give up now.

13:30.930 --> 13:32.160
Not when Captain Holt's career
is on the line.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.330
We have to get that permit.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.330
- How?
The forms don't make any sense.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.070
- I mean, is anything even real?
- No.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.900
Odds are we exist
in a computer simulation,

13:39.940 --> 13:41.540
but I don't have time
to go down that rabbit hole.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.210
Look, the fact that these forms
are broken is a good thing.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.940
It means there are
many mistakes.

13:44.970 --> 13:47.610
- Mistakes we can exploit.
- That's right.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.210
This is every form SAPO
has put out for 100 years.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.020
We have to read
every single one and look for

13:52.050 --> 13:54.920
miniscule mistakes that will
help us get that permit.

13:54.950 --> 13:57.220
So you ready for
a kick-ass assignment?

13:57.250 --> 13:58.220
- Hell yeah.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.090
Let's do this.

14:05.130 --> 14:07.360
- Hey, why'd you want
to meet out here?

14:07.400 --> 14:09.930
- Because we have
a huge surprise for you.

14:09.970 --> 14:11.900
- You found my birth mother?
- What? No.

14:11.940 --> 14:13.270
The surprise isn't gonna be
as good as that...

14:13.300 --> 14:14.970
I'm sorry I let you guess...
but...

14:17.040 --> 14:18.670
- Yeah, after we dropped you
at the hospital,

14:18.710 --> 14:20.280
we went back
and stole it for you.

14:20.310 --> 14:21.380
Now you can give it
to your uncle.

14:21.410 --> 14:23.010
- Oh, my God.

14:23.050 --> 14:24.310
He's gonna finally let me back
in the family.

14:24.350 --> 14:25.950
Fabien, Marco,

14:25.980 --> 14:27.250
I don't know how I can ever
repay you.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.650
- Oh, don't worry about it.
It was nothing.

14:28.680 --> 14:29.850
- No, it was everything.

14:29.890 --> 14:32.360
You guys believe in me,
and honestly, it saved my life.

14:32.390 --> 14:34.260
Remember the other day
at the bar when we first met?

14:34.290 --> 14:36.630
I was all alone and having
some pretty dark thoughts.

14:36.660 --> 14:37.960
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:37.990 --> 14:39.330
I was ready to just, uh,
give up...

14:39.360 --> 14:41.160
- Oh, no, Kyle.
- On my rap career.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.700
- Oh, went somewhere
different than I thought.

14:42.730 --> 14:45.300
- I'm glad that you kept rapping?
- Thanks.

14:45.330 --> 14:46.570
You're the two best dudes
I've ever known.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.010
- That's nice.
And hey, guess what?

14:49.040 --> 14:50.370
- You did find my birth mother.
- Nope.

14:50.410 --> 14:51.710
I was gonna say
you're a great guy, too,

14:51.740 --> 14:53.140
but I'm sorry
I keep teeing that up.

14:53.180 --> 14:55.640
- But you're looking for her?
- Sure.

14:57.410 --> 14:58.410
- Oh, hello, Muriel.

14:58.450 --> 15:00.680
- Ugh. The block party girls.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.950
Look, I told you,
your forms don't work.

15:02.990 --> 15:04.390
- You're not getting the permit.
- Right.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.960
But we had a different permit
in mind.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.990
- This is form 8,
as in the eighth form

15:08.020 --> 15:09.660
ever written for the city
of New York.

15:09.690 --> 15:12.030
- Those old forms are all
out of circulation.

15:12.060 --> 15:14.300
- They should be,
but someone made a mistake,

15:14.330 --> 15:17.270
and this one was never
officially decertified.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.670
- Which means it's still valid,

15:18.700 --> 15:20.400
which means
you have to process it.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.010
- "Street closure request

15:22.040 --> 15:24.370
for the public humiliation
of loose women."

15:24.410 --> 15:26.110
- And, as you can see,
you are required

15:26.140 --> 15:30.110
to expedite processing
for the fee of one hay penny.

15:30.150 --> 15:30.950
Keep the change.

15:32.020 --> 15:34.050
- Okay, but it says here
that the form...

15:34.080 --> 15:35.720
- Must be submitted by a man.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.650
I know. It's a huge bummer.

15:37.690 --> 15:39.460
- But also...
- Hi, there.

15:39.490 --> 15:41.290
I'd like to humiliate
some hussies,

15:41.320 --> 15:43.260
and I'm in a hurry.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.330
- Pumping hard
or hardly pumping, Gina?

15:50.370 --> 15:51.730
Where were you?

15:51.770 --> 15:53.240
- Uh, just so
we're on the same page,

15:53.270 --> 15:54.700
how long have you been here,

15:54.740 --> 15:56.470
i.e., how elaborate
does my lie need to be?

15:56.510 --> 15:58.070
- An hour.
- Okay.

15:58.110 --> 16:00.040
The CIA contacted me,
and there's some...

16:00.080 --> 16:03.250
- Gina, you cannot use pumping
as an excuse to slack off.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.650
- I wasn't slacking off.
- Well, you weren't here.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.780
Man, I was trying to help you.

16:07.820 --> 16:10.290
- Ugh. I know.
I'm sorry, I went home.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.120
I was missing Iggy
and I wanted to see her.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.490
- Oh, well,
you could've just told me.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.230
- Yeah, but I was embarrassed.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.730
I thought I'd be as incredible
at being a working mom

16:19.760 --> 16:21.260
as I am at everything else I do:

16:21.300 --> 16:24.770
dancing, public speaking,
Capoeira, ghost hunting...

16:24.800 --> 16:26.470
- You don't have to keep
listing things you're good at.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.110
- Earring-making,
cabinet renovation.

16:29.140 --> 16:31.310
But juggling things is hard.

16:31.340 --> 16:34.080
I feel like a failure.
I feel like a Coulier.

16:34.110 --> 16:35.780
- No, you're not a Coulier,
Gina.

16:35.810 --> 16:38.380
Look,
being a working parent is hard.

16:38.410 --> 16:40.150
When my twins were born,
I made Sharon

16:40.180 --> 16:42.790
keep the phone on all day
just so I could listen to them.

16:42.820 --> 16:46.490
One month,
I used 25,000 minutes.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.220
I'm sorry.

16:48.260 --> 16:50.430
I just realized I told you it
sucks and there's no solution.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.100
- That's okay.

16:52.130 --> 16:53.260
It's kind of nice
to hear this kind of thing

16:53.300 --> 16:57.070
from another parent,
so... thank you.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.300
You know, I don't even think
Dave Coulier juggles.

16:59.340 --> 17:01.170
- I Googled it. He doesn't.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.210
- Man... what a trip.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.540
- ♪ Rap, rap, spitting rhymes ♪

17:07.579 --> 17:10.150
♪ Kissing shorties on the lips ♪

17:10.180 --> 17:12.250
♪ Have no fear,
Mr. Rap is here ♪

17:12.280 --> 17:14.119
♪ And he will drink
three beers ♪

17:14.150 --> 17:15.520
- I wish he would
turn the radio down.

17:15.550 --> 17:17.119
- You think that's the radio?

17:17.150 --> 17:18.390
That sounds like
professional music to you?

17:18.420 --> 17:21.260
- All music after Mahler
sounds exactly like that.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.260
Now, how do we expect Kyle
to transfer the bug to Seamus?

17:24.290 --> 17:26.230
- I got him a very expensive
bottle of whiskey

17:26.260 --> 17:27.430
to give to his uncle as a gift.

17:27.460 --> 17:28.830
The transmitter's in the cork.

17:28.860 --> 17:30.330
- We planned for everything.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.040
Oops.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.310
- What was that?
- He broke the bottle.

17:37.340 --> 17:38.570
He Fredo'd it.

17:38.610 --> 17:40.180
- Oh, so you didn't plan
for everything?

17:40.210 --> 17:41.840
You forgot to
idiot-proof the bottle.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.880
- Well, perhaps you want
to idiot-proof your criticism,

17:43.910 --> 17:46.280
because I got him a backup
bottle with a backup bug.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.180
- It's a good thing
I had another one.

17:49.390 --> 17:50.550
Oh, no. God!

17:50.590 --> 17:52.460
- And... there goes
the backup bottle.

17:52.490 --> 17:54.460
- Right, except for one thing:

17:54.490 --> 17:55.890
I also put a bug in the keys.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.460
- Of course he did.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.360
Guy's got more bugs up his
sleeve than Oogie Boogie.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.160
- Don't get the reference.
- "Nightmare Before Christmas."

18:01.200 --> 18:02.370
- Oh.
- Shh, shh, shh.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.130
- They're talking.
- Hey, Uncle Seamus.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.500
- These are for you.
- You found my Rolls.

18:06.540 --> 18:08.370
I'm impressed.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.870
Hey, welcome back
to the family, huh?

18:11.910 --> 18:13.340
We got a lot
of catching up to do.

18:13.380 --> 18:14.610
- Well done.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.910
Well done. Thank you both.

18:15.940 --> 18:17.850
- We did it.
We reunited a family.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.620
Is this what it feels like
to be Oprah?

18:19.650 --> 18:21.280
- You wish.

18:24.350 --> 18:25.850
- Okay, here's what we found out

18:25.890 --> 18:26.890
from the bug that we placed.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.460
Seamus is planning on

18:28.490 --> 18:29.760
stealing $20 million
in bearer bonds

18:29.790 --> 18:31.590
from an armored truck.
As we speak,

18:31.630 --> 18:33.430
the block party
is in full swing.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.730
- Oh, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba.
Here you go.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.600
- Turns out,
he only wanted a permit

18:36.630 --> 18:38.370
so the street would be
closed down,

18:38.400 --> 18:39.470
forcing the armored truck
to divert

18:39.500 --> 18:40.770
down a narrow abandoned alley.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.570
- It's the perfect place
for an ambush,

18:42.610 --> 18:43.640
but we changed
the truck's schedule,

18:43.670 --> 18:45.470
so they hadn't picked up
the bonds yet.

18:45.510 --> 18:46.810
- Hey, there's nothing in here.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.440
- That truck is as empty

18:48.480 --> 18:51.510
as Jackson Browne's
running surface.

18:51.550 --> 18:53.450
Empty? "Running on Empty"?

18:53.480 --> 18:54.750
- He sings that song.
- Running surface?

18:54.780 --> 18:56.550
- Okay, so Terry didn't
like it... Charles?

18:56.590 --> 18:58.220
- Don't make me do this, Jake.
- Whatever.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.660
The point is,
the truck is empty.

18:59.690 --> 19:01.490
- So we did it... I can't believe
it's all wrapped up.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.590
- Do you even know what we did?
- No.

19:02.630 --> 19:04.690
Just feeling out how close
we were to calling it a day.

19:04.730 --> 19:06.460
- Soon, Scully.
Now that Captain Holt

19:06.500 --> 19:07.730
has repaid his debt
without compromising

19:07.760 --> 19:09.500
his stupid moral compass,
the only thing left

19:09.530 --> 19:10.770
is for him to get his tape back,

19:10.800 --> 19:12.770
which should be happening
right about... now.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.900
- Oh.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.540
- Your block party's going well.

19:15.570 --> 19:16.940
- Wasn't as much fun
as I hoped it would be,

19:16.970 --> 19:20.210
but, um, you lived up
to your end of the bargain, so.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.210
- I'm a man of my word.
- As am I.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.680
Your tape.

19:23.710 --> 19:24.950
You ever want
to do business again,

19:24.980 --> 19:26.580
my door is always open.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.920
- Well, you should close it,
lest you get moths.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.690
Good day.

19:32.460 --> 19:33.820
Hey, there, sir.

19:33.860 --> 19:35.520
Top of the mornin' to you.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.730
- Oh, no. What's wrong?

19:36.760 --> 19:37.930
- Why do you always assume
something's wrong

19:37.960 --> 19:39.260
when I come in here?

19:39.300 --> 19:40.260
Couldn't I be bringing you
good news?

19:40.300 --> 19:41.430
- Are you?
- No.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.800
Something's terribly wrong.

19:42.830 --> 19:44.530
- It's Seamus.
- What do you mean?

19:44.570 --> 19:46.270
Forensics confirmed
the tape he made of me

19:46.300 --> 19:47.270
was never copied.
We're in the clear.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.640
- It's not about that.

19:48.670 --> 19:49.810
I was checking our bug,
and I overheard him

19:49.840 --> 19:52.640
talking about what went wrong
with the armored car heist.

19:52.680 --> 19:53.940
He's pinning the blame on...

19:53.980 --> 19:56.580
- Kyle. It has to be him.

19:56.610 --> 19:58.450
Everything was going great
until he suddenly reappeared

19:58.480 --> 19:59.650
out of the blue.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.550
I bet that dum-dum
ran his mouth,

20:01.580 --> 20:04.890
and that is the last time
he screws over this family.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.290
He's gonna pay.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.820
- Did he say
what he would do to him?

20:07.860 --> 20:09.960
- No, they ran over a huge
pothole and then complained

20:09.990 --> 20:11.760
about de Blasio
for the next hour.

20:11.790 --> 20:12.960
- Yes, he needs to do something
about the roads.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.530
- Look,
I don't specifically know

20:14.560 --> 20:15.730
they're gonna
do something bad to Kyle.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.930
They might just lightly beat
him up, so we could do nothing.

20:17.970 --> 20:20.700
- We could take the loophole.
- You do love loopholes.

20:20.740 --> 20:22.940
- I know we just put Seamus
behind us,

20:22.970 --> 20:26.710
but unfortunately,
you've made me a better person.

20:26.740 --> 20:29.810
- I think we have to help Kyle.
- Good.

20:29.850 --> 20:31.550
I'm proud of you.

20:31.580 --> 20:34.650
- Oh.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.780
Sorry, it's just...

20:35.820 --> 20:38.750
you said you're proud of me.
That's my tear trigger.

20:38.790 --> 20:39.760
All right.

20:40.620 --> 20:41.990
Let's go save Kyle
before the dam breaks.

20:47.760 --> 20:48.900
- Hello, Seamus.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.700
- Hello, Raymond.

20:50.730 --> 20:52.800
So, apparently,
NYPD police came today

20:52.840 --> 20:56.670
to arrest my nephew Kyle
for unpaid parking violations.

20:56.710 --> 20:59.010
- And you want me to, what,
clear his record?

20:59.040 --> 21:00.980
I've already done my favor.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.510
- No, I know it's a cover.

21:02.550 --> 21:03.850
I know
he's in protective custody

21:03.880 --> 21:06.320
because he helped you stop
my armored car play.

21:06.350 --> 21:07.850
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.690
- No?
- You asked me for a permit,

21:09.720 --> 21:11.520
and I got it. I've paid my debt.

21:11.550 --> 21:12.920
Now, if you'll excuse me,

21:12.960 --> 21:14.590
I have a bowl of mush to enjoy.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.960
- You're right.
You don't owe me anything.

21:16.990 --> 21:18.860
But I owe you.

21:20.660 --> 21:21.560
- And what, exactly,
does that mean?

21:22.430 --> 21:22.930
- That means you mess with
my family,

21:23.430 --> 21:25.070
I mess with yours.

21:25.100 --> 21:29.610
You tell your husband, Kevin,
I'll see him real soon.

21:31.670 --> 21:33.840
- Not a doctor. Shh.
