00:43.500 --> 00:44.900
Excuse me.

01:06.899 --> 01:08.399
Pa?

01:09.199 --> 01:10.899
You all right, Pa?

01:13.499 --> 01:16.399
- You're up early.
- I got a big day ahead.

01:16.499 --> 01:18.399
I wish you didn't have to go.

01:18.399 --> 01:21.099
I promised to help this friend.

01:22.399 --> 01:24.099
Goddamn outhouse.

01:24.799 --> 01:27.699
One of these days soon,
I'm changing all that.

01:28.199 --> 01:29.499
Damn soon.

01:32.299 --> 01:34.099
You drive careful now.

04:48.792 --> 04:51.492
Young man? Young man.
I'm terribly sorry.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.791
Ma'am, can I have a root beer?

05:18.891 --> 05:22.091
- Anything else to go with that?
- Some aspirins, please.

05:25.891 --> 05:28.691
<i>"Friend P. Came out in August...</i>

05:29.291 --> 05:31.791
<i>"...and after you left, I met someone.</i>

05:32.191 --> 05:35.591
<i>"He put me onto something
we could bring off beautiful.</i>

05:35.891 --> 05:38.291
<i>"A cinch, the perfect score.</i>

05:40.191 --> 05:43.490
<i>"It's a sure thing. Am depending on you.</i>

05:44.190 --> 05:45.390
<i>"Love, Dick.</i>

05:45.490 --> 05:48.690
<i>"P.S. Will meet your bus, November 14.</i>

05:49.290 --> 05:52.590
<i>"M-day."M" for money, honey."</i>

05:58.090 --> 05:59.790
Fill her up, buddy.

06:00.590 --> 06:02.490
You sure got a perfect day for it.

06:02.790 --> 06:05.290
- What's that?
- Hunting pheasants.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.290
Yes, indeedy.

06:08.390 --> 06:10.290
Deadeye Dick Hickock?

06:10.490 --> 06:14.290
Them birds don't know it,
but this is their last day on Earth.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.389
Good morning, Daddy.

06:31.589 --> 06:35.189
- Well, you're up early.
- I've got a furious day ahead.

06:55.489 --> 06:56.489
'Morning, Dad.

06:57.289 --> 07:00.289
- Thought maybe I smelled smoke.
- Yeah.

07:00.489 --> 07:03.289
Me, too. Could be a leaky valve.

07:04.089 --> 07:05.389
Could be.

07:08.089 --> 07:11.189
Peppermints before breakfast
might stunt your growth.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.188
Daddy, phone.

07:14.288 --> 07:16.188
It's the insurance man.

07:16.988 --> 07:19.488
This afternoon, anytime before dark.

07:24.587 --> 07:25.687
Hello?

07:25.987 --> 07:28.887
I want to call
the Kansas State Penitentiary.

07:31.487 --> 07:34.987
Person-to-person. Rev. James Post.

07:36.587 --> 07:39.187
Rev. James Post.

07:41.187 --> 07:42.587
My name is...

07:44.087 --> 07:47.387
Perry Smith.
He'll be checking in sometime tomorrow.

07:47.487 --> 07:51.087
- Can I see the room, please?
- Ain't you working today?

07:51.387 --> 07:53.487
Now, ain't you?

07:57.986 --> 07:59.286
Hello.

07:59.986 --> 08:01.386
Perry.

08:02.386 --> 08:04.286
Of course, I remember you.

08:08.686 --> 08:09.986
Kansas City?

08:10.386 --> 08:11.586
Missouri.

08:13.086 --> 08:14.986
I'm at the bus terminal.

08:17.486 --> 08:19.586
I'm waiting for Willie Jay.

08:21.186 --> 08:23.586
Did something hold up his parole?

08:25.886 --> 08:29.586
- I was supposed to meet him right here.
- Perry, think.

08:30.086 --> 08:32.586
You've already broken parole
by quitting your job.

08:32.885 --> 08:35.285
You'll break it again
if you step into Kansas.

08:35.486 --> 08:38.486
Whatever you do,
don't cross that river into Kansas.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.986
Can you tell me where he went?

08:44.884 --> 08:46.284
Please, Jim.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.284
It's very important.

08:54.884 --> 08:57.484
Maybe the most important thing in my life.

08:58.284 --> 09:01.284
Go back. Why not see your father?

09:13.484 --> 09:15.484
'Morning, Ma.

09:17.884 --> 09:20.484
Daddy, you know Jolene?

09:20.584 --> 09:23.384
I promised to teach her
how to bake a cherry pie.

09:23.384 --> 09:26.184
- Sounds serious.
- She insists on today.

09:26.184 --> 09:28.883
That makes it practically a catastrophe.

09:29.483 --> 09:33.083
Because I also promised
to help Roxy with her trumpet solo.

09:33.183 --> 09:36.883
And errands for Mother in Garden City,
lunch with Susan...

09:36.883 --> 09:40.083
Suppose I take care
of your mother's errands?

09:40.983 --> 09:42.283
Thank you, Daddy.

09:59.283 --> 10:02.883
<i>Also provided for your convenience,
at the baggage counter...</i>

10:02.983 --> 10:05.282
<i>... are identification tags.</i>

10:06.682 --> 10:08.682
<i>This is your last call...</i>

10:08.882 --> 10:13.082
<i>... for Buckner, Bluffington, Lexington,
Waverly, Marshall...</i>

10:13.082 --> 10:16.481
<i>... and intermediate flights.</i>

10:16.681 --> 10:19.681
<i>Now boarding at door number six.</i>

11:23.680 --> 11:25.380
Stick 'em up!

11:25.680 --> 11:28.080
- Hey, buddy.
- How long have you been standing there?

11:28.180 --> 11:30.380
Long enough to catch your late late show.

11:30.580 --> 11:33.580
- Just between you and I.
- You and me.

11:33.580 --> 11:37.080
How come you always go into a trance
every time you look in the mirror?

11:37.180 --> 11:40.580
Just like you was looking
at some gorgeous piece of butt.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.180
What in the hell is in here?

11:45.680 --> 11:46.879
Concrete?

11:46.979 --> 11:51.079
That's all my stuff. Books, letters, songs.

11:51.679 --> 11:53.579
Souvenirs from Korea.

11:54.279 --> 11:56.579
And our ticket to fame and fortune.

11:56.679 --> 11:58.979
I got a secret map that's going to lead us...

11:58.979 --> 12:01.979
...straight to the sunken treasure
of Captain Cortés.

12:02.079 --> 12:05.979
$60 million in Spanish gold,
off the coast of Mexico.

12:06.079 --> 12:08.479
So, that's why that map's
so frigging heavy.

12:09.679 --> 12:13.179
Welcome back to Kansas, buddy.
The heart of America.

12:14.379 --> 12:17.079
The land of wheat, corn, bibles, and...

12:18.579 --> 12:20.279
...natural gas.

12:22.179 --> 12:25.579
That map's not as heavy as yours,
but it's the real thing.

12:25.779 --> 12:29.479
And it's gonna get us $10,000 by tonight.

12:29.979 --> 12:33.978
Four hundred miles west of here,
Big Daddy Clutter's place.

12:35.878 --> 12:38.078
That's the layout. The works.

12:38.678 --> 12:41.378
Somewhere in that office,
in one little old safe.

12:41.378 --> 12:44.777
And inside that safe, $10,000, maybe more.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.077
You've seen it?

12:48.177 --> 12:49.377
The safe!

12:50.477 --> 12:53.777
Right after you left the zoo,
a new guy moved into the cell.

12:53.777 --> 12:56.477
Floyd Wells,
serving three to five for robbery.

12:57.577 --> 13:00.177
He once worked for Clutter. He saw it.

13:00.677 --> 13:02.977
And that's your perfect score?

13:03.277 --> 13:04.977
Baby, it's a cinch.

13:05.977 --> 13:10.377
I promise you, honey,
we'll blast hair all over them walls.

13:25.076 --> 13:27.076
- Hello, Roxy.
- 'Morning, Mr. Clutter.

13:27.176 --> 13:29.376
I think Nancy's expecting you.

14:09.974 --> 14:13.674
You want to watch it, boy.
You'll end up an aspirin junkie.

14:13.874 --> 14:17.374
Been one for seven years.
Got the habit in the hospital.

14:18.374 --> 14:19.574
Doctors.

14:20.774 --> 14:22.874
They made a dwarf out of me.

14:22.974 --> 14:26.374
Doctors and lawyers. What do they care?

14:27.674 --> 14:30.874
Ever see a millionaire
fry in the electric chair?

14:30.974 --> 14:32.274
Hell, no.

14:33.274 --> 14:35.274
There's two kinds of laws, honey:

14:35.874 --> 14:38.674
One for the rich and one for the poor.

14:40.974 --> 14:42.374
Look at me.

14:42.474 --> 14:44.974
I crack up my car,
wake up in a charity ward...

14:44.974 --> 14:46.874
...and don't even recognize myself.

14:47.174 --> 14:50.473
I hate to count how much classy pussy
that's cost me.

14:52.373 --> 14:55.273
They left you a wonderful smile, though.

14:56.873 --> 14:59.073
Yeah, the all-American boy.

15:50.871 --> 15:52.471
That was stupid.

15:52.971 --> 15:56.071
Stealing a lousy pack of razor blades,
to prove what?

15:56.071 --> 15:58.571
Everybody steals something sometime.

15:58.971 --> 16:02.571
It's the national pastime, baby.
Stealing and cheating.

16:02.871 --> 16:05.471
If they caught every cheating wife
and tax chiseler...

16:05.571 --> 16:08.071
...the whole country
would be behind prison walls.

16:08.171 --> 16:10.971
- Where are the black stockings?
- They didn't have black.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.571
- Stop someplace else.
- Where?

16:15.171 --> 16:17.471
- A Catholic hospital.
- Sure.

16:17.571 --> 16:20.570
We'll just barge in like it was
a goddamn five-and-dime.

16:20.770 --> 16:24.170
Sister, sweetie, we gotta have
some black stockings to hide our face.

16:24.270 --> 16:25.770
Okay, forget it.

16:26.370 --> 16:29.070
Anyway, nuns are bad luck.

16:30.370 --> 16:32.170
Kind of sexy, though.

16:32.270 --> 16:35.570
You wouldn't think so if you'd lived
in one of those orphan homes...

16:35.670 --> 16:38.270
...with those black widows always at you.

16:38.370 --> 16:41.870
Always sneaking up in the dark,
spying while you sleep.

16:42.270 --> 16:45.370
Hitting you with a flashlight
for wetting the bed.

16:46.070 --> 16:49.470
That's the first time
I was saved by the yellow bird.

16:49.970 --> 16:51.170
The what?

16:51.670 --> 16:53.270
Sort of a parrot.

16:53.970 --> 16:55.670
Taller than Jesus.

16:56.370 --> 16:58.770
Brilliant yellow, like a sunflower.

17:00.070 --> 17:03.070
It attacked those nuns
like an avenging angel.

17:04.369 --> 17:06.469
The nuns begged for mercy.

17:07.269 --> 17:10.169
But the yellow bird
slaughtered them anyway.

17:12.269 --> 17:14.868
Then the bird folded me in its wings...

17:15.569 --> 17:17.868
...and lifted me up to paradise.

17:19.169 --> 17:22.169
That's one hell of a bird
to have on your side.

17:24.169 --> 17:27.269
Anyway, that's why I have
an aversion to nuns...

17:27.368 --> 17:29.269
...and God and religion.

17:29.969 --> 17:33.469
Forget it.
Black stockings are a waste of time.

17:33.869 --> 17:37.669
No one's gonna remember us
because we're leaving no witnesses.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.767
How about staying at our place tonight?

18:15.967 --> 18:18.367
Frozen stiff TV dinners on trays...

18:18.667 --> 18:21.067
...spaghetti, macaroni or pizza.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.067
- Sounds irresistible.
- I'll tell Mom.

18:24.167 --> 18:27.867
<i>- Golly, Sue. C'est impossible.
- Pourquoi, chérie?</i>

18:27.967 --> 18:31.367
- Bobby's coming over.
- I'll pick you up for church tomorrow.

18:31.467 --> 18:32.767
9:00 sharp.

18:47.566 --> 18:50.266
A full day's work
deserves a full-course dinner.

18:50.466 --> 18:52.666
The condemned ate a hearty meal.

18:52.666 --> 18:56.366
I don't know what they ate,
but tonight, cheeseburgers.

18:56.466 --> 18:57.966
Tomorrow?

18:58.366 --> 18:59.566
Mexico.

19:00.266 --> 19:03.466
<i>- Fabulous Mexico.
- Land of the hot tamales.</i>

19:04.966 --> 19:06.666
Gold country.

19:08.066 --> 19:11.966
<i>Remember Bogart
in Treasure of the Sierra Madre?</i>

19:14.066 --> 19:16.566
<i>We could get us a couple of burros.</i>

19:16.866 --> 19:18.066
Some tools.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.966
Slow down, honey.
I don't know gold dust from diarrhea.

19:20.966 --> 19:22.366
Well, I do.

19:23.864 --> 19:27.064
My old man prospected for gold in Alaska.

19:28.564 --> 19:31.064
He taught me all the ins and outs.

19:31.364 --> 19:34.064
Yeah. And we end up nuts.

19:34.464 --> 19:38.064
No gold, nothing. Just like in the movie.

19:43.564 --> 19:45.564
You never meant it...

19:47.464 --> 19:51.264
...about going to Mexico, did you?
Did you?

19:55.864 --> 19:57.264
Sure, baby.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.864
Sure we're going.

20:01.264 --> 20:04.564
But first we gotta dig up some capital.
Like tonight.

20:05.164 --> 20:08.863
$5,000 a piece, for one hour's work.

20:11.163 --> 20:14.763
- May I take your orders?
- Two cheeseburgers, please.

20:26.363 --> 20:28.363
Getting insured is like...

20:28.463 --> 20:31.663
...well, when you wash your car,
it always rains.

20:32.063 --> 20:34.763
Know what we call this
in the insurance game?

20:34.863 --> 20:36.263
The solemn moment.

20:37.563 --> 20:40.963
I guess when a man makes out a policy
or takes out his last will...

20:41.063 --> 20:44.062
...it's only natural to think about mortality.

20:44.462 --> 20:49.062
Herb, as of this minute,
your life is worth $40,000.

20:49.762 --> 20:52.762
In case of accidental death,
double indemnity.

20:53.462 --> 20:57.161
New York Life wishes you
a very long and very healthy life.

20:57.261 --> 21:00.461
- And so do I.
- And so do I.

21:09.261 --> 21:13.261
That waitress.
Nice piece of blonde chicken.

21:13.561 --> 21:15.861
Why'd you pick me for this job?

21:17.361 --> 21:20.061
A perfect score needs perfect partners.

21:20.161 --> 21:22.361
Together we're a perfect fit.

21:23.261 --> 21:25.761
It's your score. Where do I fit in?

21:26.561 --> 21:30.161
I got you figured for a natural-born killer.

21:31.361 --> 21:34.361
Or did you lie about that punk in Vegas?

21:36.161 --> 21:37.461
No.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.661
Why did you kill him?

21:40.960 --> 21:43.560
No special reason. Just for the hell of it.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.360
That's the best reason of all.

21:48.260 --> 21:51.160
Back there, you wanted to kill me.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.360
Just for a second, right?

21:55.060 --> 21:56.460
It passed.

21:57.060 --> 21:58.860
Hair-trigger temper.

21:59.260 --> 22:01.360
Somebody crosses you, voom!

22:02.760 --> 22:05.160
Yes, sir. You've got the gift, boy.

22:05.860 --> 22:08.560
Remember the chaplain's clerk, Willie Jay?

22:09.460 --> 22:13.760
- The guy you painted to look like Jesus?
- He said the same thing:

22:14.360 --> 22:16.360
"Unstable, explosive."

22:17.160 --> 22:19.060
He is a flaming faggot.

22:19.460 --> 22:21.360
He has a brilliant mind.

22:21.460 --> 22:24.560
Then how come
he got caught stealing five times?

22:25.459 --> 22:29.559
- He was the best friend I ever had.
- I'm the only friend you got now.

22:30.659 --> 22:34.059
Friend to the end, for better or worse.

22:35.859 --> 22:37.859
Till death do us part?

22:38.559 --> 22:40.759
All we need is a ring, sugar.

23:02.959 --> 23:04.559
Is that Bobby?

23:13.058 --> 23:15.158
Look at that land, will you?

23:15.558 --> 23:18.058
Oil money, gas money, wheat money.

23:19.258 --> 23:21.158
Share the wealth, baby.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.956
- How does it feel?
- What?

24:36.956 --> 24:38.556
Being a father.

24:40.256 --> 24:41.356
Great.

24:41.856 --> 24:45.354
- Your kids, you love them?
- I'm their father, ain't I?

24:45.454 --> 24:48.554
I didn't ask if you were their father.
I asked if you love them.

24:49.354 --> 24:51.054
I'm crazy about 'em.

24:51.154 --> 24:53.854
- But you left them.
- Left their mother.

24:55.854 --> 24:58.154
Okay. She left me.

24:58.754 --> 25:01.154
There was this piece of tail,
nothing serious.

25:01.254 --> 25:03.554
Just a quickie in the back seat.

25:04.054 --> 25:07.254
She blew the whistle on me.
Said I knocked her up.

25:09.054 --> 25:11.754
That's how I got to be a two-time loser.

25:12.154 --> 25:14.354
You ditched the kids for her.

25:14.554 --> 25:18.054
Jesus, baby.
I had to do the right thing by her, didn't I?

25:20.354 --> 25:22.454
Well? Didn't I?

25:23.454 --> 25:24.854
Yeah.

25:35.753 --> 25:38.753
- 'Night!
- See you tomorrow, Bobby.

25:57.753 --> 26:00.753
- How much longer?
- Seven miles.

26:19.051 --> 26:20.951
Fill her up with regular.

27:01.550 --> 27:03.150
Want some candy?

27:03.750 --> 27:05.350
No.

27:08.650 --> 27:10.150
You okay?

27:10.550 --> 27:12.050
I'm fine.

27:16.350 --> 27:17.550
Coming?

27:23.950 --> 27:25.350
Let's go.

27:27.050 --> 27:31.050
<i>News from the Associated Press,
NBC, and the Garden City Telegram.</i>

27:31.950 --> 27:34.550
- Goodnight, Dad.
- Goodnight, Son.

27:34.950 --> 27:38.050
<i>Winds from the south
at about 15 miles per hour.</i>

27:38.450 --> 27:43.750
<i>The Garden City Sale Company reported
3,273 cattle at the auction yesterday.</i>

27:44.050 --> 27:45.349
'Night.

27:45.449 --> 27:50.349
<i>... calves went from $26.50 to $30.
However, very few reached the $30 mark.</i>

27:51.549 --> 27:54.149
<i>The medium and good kinds
sold as high as $26.50...</i>

29:06.647 --> 29:08.847
Look at that spread.

29:09.047 --> 29:11.747
Don't tell me this guy ain't loaded.

29:26.846 --> 29:28.746
Let's pull out of here.

29:29.046 --> 29:31.546
Now, before it's too late.

30:30.544 --> 30:33.744
- Pa?
- Maybe they're still asleep.

30:38.444 --> 30:39.544
Nancy?

31:26.942 --> 31:28.442
Don't touch it.

31:30.142 --> 31:31.942
Don't touch anything.

31:32.442 --> 31:34.241
Been up there?

31:52.241 --> 31:53.841
My God.

32:11.141 --> 32:13.241
There's two more in the basement.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.840
I just saw two ambulances
going up to Clutter's.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.040
I just wondering what's happening.

32:53.740 --> 32:57.640
<i>The Sheriff placed an urgent call
to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.</i>

32:57.740 --> 33:02.840
<i>In Topeka, Logan Sanford, KBI chief,
assigned four men to the Clutter case.</i>

33:03.740 --> 33:07.539
<i>They are agents Dewey, Nye,
Duntz, and Church.</i>

33:08.139 --> 33:12.939
- What happened to the basketball game?
- It got interrupted. Terrible thing, that.

33:14.539 --> 33:17.339
I've never been so hungry in my whole life.

33:17.939 --> 33:21.039
<i>Agent Alvin Dewey arrived
at the Clutter house...</i>

33:21.039 --> 33:23.539
<i>... in advance of the other KBI men.</i>

33:24.139 --> 33:28.039
<i>Mr. Dewey, resident of Garden City,
was placed in charge of the case.</i>

33:28.039 --> 33:28.539
<i>Mr. Dewey, resident of Garden City,
was placed in charge of the case.</i>

33:32.639 --> 33:35.039
Were all four tied with the same cord?

33:35.439 --> 33:37.739
All tied with the same square knot.

33:37.839 --> 33:40.639
Used by anybody
who works with livestock.

33:40.839 --> 33:43.639
- Find any shell casings?
- Nope.

33:45.039 --> 33:46.939
Which means that...

33:47.139 --> 33:50.039
...you can bet
they didn't leave any fingerprints either.

33:54.238 --> 33:55.538
Al.

33:56.738 --> 33:59.238
- This is the housekeeper.
- Thank you for coming.

33:59.338 --> 34:01.138
- Are they still...
- No, no, ma'am.

34:01.238 --> 34:03.737
They've been taken to the funeral home.

34:04.637 --> 34:07.337
Now, if you'll just look around
with Mr. Church here...

34:07.337 --> 34:09.337
...to see if anything is missing...

34:09.437 --> 34:12.437
They never hurt anybody. Why them?

34:25.137 --> 34:26.937
Al, you knew Clutter.

34:29.637 --> 34:31.337
Did he have a safe?

34:32.036 --> 34:34.137
Keep a lot of cash on hand?

34:34.536 --> 34:36.335
The old Kansas myth.

34:36.835 --> 34:39.335
Every farmer with a good spread
is supposed to have...

34:39.436 --> 34:42.335
...a hidden black box somewhere
filled with money.

34:42.436 --> 34:46.235
No. Herb paid everything by check.
Even a $2 haircut.

34:47.936 --> 34:49.636
Well, then why...

34:49.636 --> 34:52.136
...if they're going
to shoot them all anyway, why...

34:53.936 --> 34:56.536
...did they first cut Clutter's throat?

34:59.136 --> 35:02.036
Why did they first put him
on a soft mattress box?

35:02.136 --> 35:03.736
To make him comfy?

35:04.636 --> 35:07.236
And why the pillow under the boy's head?

35:09.136 --> 35:12.236
We keep saying "they."
It could have been one man.

35:15.136 --> 35:16.436
A madman.

35:21.236 --> 35:23.934
This picture was taken
with a time exposure.

35:24.334 --> 35:26.634
It shows only what the eye saw.

35:27.734 --> 35:30.334
This picture was taken with a flashbulb.

35:30.434 --> 35:32.834
That's a different pair of shoes.

35:34.334 --> 35:35.534
Yeah.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.234
We know there were at least two of them.

35:40.734 --> 35:44.134
You won't see it there.
The flash made them stand out in the dust.

35:44.234 --> 35:46.934
- You develop those pictures yourself?
- Yes.

35:47.034 --> 35:49.634
- Newspaper boys seen this?
- Not yet.

35:50.934 --> 35:52.634
Keep it that way.

35:56.934 --> 35:59.434
Al, when can we see the Clutter home?

35:59.434 --> 36:01.534
Why were the men killed in the basement?

36:01.634 --> 36:03.834
I'll talk facts, not theories.

36:05.634 --> 36:08.333
It happened around 2:00 a.m.

36:09.733 --> 36:12.833
All four were apparently killed
by the same weapon.

36:12.933 --> 36:16.533
Shotgun, 12-gauge.
Mr. Clutter's throat was cut.

36:17.033 --> 36:18.733
Before he was shot?

36:19.933 --> 36:21.433
Probably.

36:22.533 --> 36:25.633
All four were tied
with the same nylon sash-cord...

36:25.633 --> 36:28.133
...sold in most hardware stores.

36:28.633 --> 36:30.333
And their mouths were taped.

36:30.433 --> 36:33.033
How were they tied? What kind of knots?

36:33.633 --> 36:35.633
Can we see police pictures?

36:35.733 --> 36:37.633
- Find the murder weapon?
- Not yet.

36:37.733 --> 36:41.233
- Any clues or fingerprints?
- Lots. All belong to the family.

36:41.333 --> 36:44.632
They say that Nancy's boyfriend
is a prime suspect.

36:44.732 --> 36:47.932
- Is that what they say?
- He was the last one to see them alive.

36:48.232 --> 36:51.232
- Except the killers.
- Then there were more than one?

36:51.332 --> 36:54.231
- Were the women sexually molested?
- The coroner says not.

36:54.331 --> 36:56.531
- Why didn't the dog bark?
- He didn't bark?

36:56.531 --> 37:00.231
- Nobody heard him.
- Nobody heard the gunshots either.

37:02.131 --> 37:04.231
Mr. Dewey, in your opinion...

37:04.331 --> 37:07.131
...do you think it could have been
an inside job, sir?

37:07.131 --> 37:10.831
- Why didn't Mr. Clutter resist?
- Mr. Dewey, just a moment, Mr. Dewey.

37:11.631 --> 37:13.331
What about the hired man?

37:13.331 --> 37:16.831
His check was made out for $1,707.

37:16.931 --> 37:19.931
Mr. Clutter's first premium
on a straight life policy...

37:20.031 --> 37:22.131
...worth $40,000.

37:22.531 --> 37:25.531
Double indemnity makes it $80,000.

37:26.131 --> 37:28.831
And that makes it a strange coincidence.

37:31.431 --> 37:33.731
And that's all it is, a coincidence.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.831
I didn't catch your name.

37:38.031 --> 37:40.230
<i>Bill Jensen, Weekly magazine.</i>

37:40.830 --> 37:44.230
If you're not here to write news,
what is your interest?

37:45.830 --> 37:47.330
Fairly basic.

37:49.030 --> 37:51.730
What's basic about a stupid...

37:52.530 --> 37:54.130
...senseless crime?

37:55.030 --> 37:59.530
A violent, unknown force
destroys a decent, ordinary family.

38:00.730 --> 38:02.930
No clues. No logic.

38:04.430 --> 38:07.530
Makes us all feel frightened. Vulnerable.

38:08.630 --> 38:12.030
Murder's no mystery. Only the motive.

38:13.630 --> 38:14.930
Got one?

38:16.930 --> 38:18.530
I smoke too much.

38:19.230 --> 38:22.430
How'd they enter the house?
A key? Force a window?

38:23.330 --> 38:25.229
Probably just walked in.

38:26.029 --> 38:30.329
- Don't people around here lock doors?
- They will tonight.

38:32.829 --> 38:35.229
I know something's wrong here.

38:36.129 --> 38:37.429
I feel it.

38:38.429 --> 38:40.629
I don't know what it is, but...

38:40.729 --> 38:43.429
Mr. Clutter never allowed smoking
in the house.

38:43.729 --> 38:45.029
Sorry.

38:45.529 --> 38:46.929
Something.

38:49.529 --> 38:51.729
But of course.

38:52.829 --> 38:54.429
The radio!

38:55.029 --> 38:57.429
Kenyon always listened
to the news and weather...

38:57.529 --> 38:59.229
...before he went to bed.

39:00.029 --> 39:01.529
But where's his radio?

39:02.229 --> 39:04.529
<i>Since the night of horror, two days ago...</i>

39:04.829 --> 39:08.729
<i>... few people are seen on the streets
of Garden City after dark.</i>

39:09.129 --> 39:11.728
<i>To date, no clues have been uncovered.</i>

39:12.628 --> 39:14.528
<i>No clues whatever.</i>

39:16.028 --> 39:20.328
<i>It was generally known that Clutter
never had large sums of cash on hand.</i>

39:20.828 --> 39:22.627
<i>No expensive jewels.</i>

39:22.927 --> 39:25.427
<i>Nor even a steel safe in which to...</i>

39:27.127 --> 39:29.727
Perry, baby,
if you don't want that burger...

39:34.127 --> 39:37.127
You and your hotshot
prison buddy Floyd Wells.

39:38.227 --> 39:40.227
Big, fat safe in the wall.

39:41.427 --> 39:44.627
$10,000. "A cinch."

39:45.527 --> 39:49.127
Okay, Floyd's a jerk.
But we scored, didn't we?

39:49.427 --> 39:50.727
Perfecto.

39:52.227 --> 39:54.327
You call an 800-mile drive...

39:54.827 --> 39:57.426
...and the rest of it, for 43...

39:57.526 --> 39:59.926
...lousy dollars, you call that perfect?

40:00.426 --> 40:01.526
And that!

40:02.126 --> 40:05.026
You don't believe that con
about no clues do you?

40:06.426 --> 40:07.926
You worry too much.

40:08.226 --> 40:11.126
How are them cowboys
gonna connect us? Remember?

40:11.626 --> 40:13.026
No witnesses.

40:14.826 --> 40:16.226
I know one.

40:22.526 --> 40:24.826
You. You're a witness.

40:28.726 --> 40:32.126
Jesus, kid. For a minute,
I thought you blew your cork.

40:35.026 --> 40:36.426
You're so right.

40:37.926 --> 40:40.026
We're the only ones who saw it...

40:40.526 --> 40:42.624
...and that, honey, is our big ace.

40:43.824 --> 40:47.524
Because if they can't split us apart,
they can't get a confession.

40:47.524 --> 40:50.524
And if they can't get a confession,
they got nothing.

40:51.924 --> 40:53.024
Next move...

40:55.524 --> 40:56.724
...Mexico.

40:57.424 --> 40:59.624
- Once we beat it out of the country.
- On what?

41:00.524 --> 41:03.124
$43 and a smile and bullshit?

41:04.224 --> 41:08.424
You guessed it, Chief.
It's the smile that does it.

41:09.724 --> 41:11.624
Like it says in the commercials:

41:11.724 --> 41:14.724
"The family that sticks together
lives forever."

41:25.524 --> 41:28.923
<i>Officers investigating the slaying
have appealed to the public...</i>

41:29.023 --> 41:31.023
<i>... for help in solving the crime.</i>

41:31.123 --> 41:35.023
<i>A Kansas paper, The Hutchison News,
has offered a reward for any information...</i>

41:35.023 --> 41:37.723
<i>... leading to the capture
and conviction of the person...</i>

41:37.823 --> 41:40.823
<i>... or persons, guilty of the Clutter murders.</i>

41:40.823 --> 41:43.423
<i>A reward of $1,000.</i>

41:46.223 --> 41:50.123
What about the reward?
That's right, $1,000.

41:53.323 --> 41:55.323
Yes, sir. Where are you calling from?

41:56.623 --> 41:58.523
Yeah. Go ahead.

42:01.223 --> 42:02.222
Who?

42:05.822 --> 42:07.922
How do you know he was a foreigner?

42:10.222 --> 42:13.921
- I see. Thank you very much, sir.
- Another tip?

42:16.121 --> 42:17.921
He says he saw a foreigner running.

42:18.921 --> 42:20.921
How does a foreigner run, anyway?

42:21.021 --> 42:23.721
Just how many people
have tried to claim this reward?

42:23.821 --> 42:25.621
Just about everybody.

42:27.021 --> 42:28.921
A mysterious stranger did it.

42:29.421 --> 42:32.821
Hired killers did it.
A jealous neighbor did it.

42:33.721 --> 42:36.921
Seems like the only one
who didn't do it is the butler.

42:38.421 --> 42:39.321
Any luck?

42:40.421 --> 42:43.221
None of the Clutters had shoes
with a cat's paw.

42:43.521 --> 42:47.621
No diamond pattern, either.
Insurance money goes to the family.

42:48.721 --> 42:51.321
And this, Nancy Clutter's.

42:53.221 --> 42:55.621
Found it hidden in the toe of her slipper.

42:56.221 --> 42:58.121
Something must've scared her.

42:58.321 --> 43:01.620
All of which brings us back
to the motive of robbery.

43:03.020 --> 43:06.620
I can believe one man might work up
enough rage to do it.

43:07.120 --> 43:07.920
But two?

43:09.620 --> 43:12.920
Who would kill four people in cold blood
for a radio...

43:13.420 --> 43:17.320
...a pair of binoculars and $40 in cash?

43:18.420 --> 43:22.220
These days? Take your pick
on any crowded street.

43:24.920 --> 43:26.320
You ever hang any paper?

43:26.420 --> 43:29.320
I couldn't cash a check even if it was good.

43:45.219 --> 43:47.819
Easy, baby. Casual.

43:55.019 --> 43:58.119
Excuse me. My name's Hickock.
Richie. And you're?

43:58.219 --> 43:59.819
Sharp. Luke Sharp.

44:00.119 --> 44:02.719
I'll bet in school
they called you Look Sharp.

44:03.119 --> 44:04.819
See that gentleman over there?

44:04.919 --> 44:07.619
Would you believe a runt like that
is getting married?

44:07.719 --> 44:13.219
Well, maybe he ain't any Fred Astaire
but he's my best friend...

44:14.119 --> 44:15.819
...and I'm his best man.

44:16.519 --> 44:20.019
My wedding present to him
is going to be what you might call...

44:20.019 --> 44:21.519
...his trousseau.

44:31.518 --> 44:34.418
Ideal shade for an informal ceremony,
don't you think?

44:34.418 --> 44:35.518
Perfectly ideal.

44:35.618 --> 44:38.418
Of course,
we are a tiny bit oddly proportioned.

44:38.418 --> 44:42.117
I mean, the upper torso is so large
compared to the legs.

44:44.417 --> 44:46.117
I'm terribly sorry.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.817
He's not ashamed of them scars.

44:49.317 --> 44:51.617
They gave him the Bronze Star in Korea.

44:52.717 --> 44:57.217
Luke, have you ever been to Eden Roc?
In Miami Beach.

44:57.417 --> 45:00.417
That's where the happy couple
is shacking up for their honeymoon.

45:00.517 --> 45:03.517
Two weeks all paid up.
Surprise gift from the folks.

45:03.617 --> 45:04.917
He's a very lucky man.

45:05.017 --> 45:06.317
He deserves it.

45:08.317 --> 45:12.117
And with these, $192.70.

45:12.417 --> 45:15.117
Would you like them wrapped
and taken to your car?

45:15.117 --> 45:17.716
No hurry.
Deliver them when the suit is ready.

45:17.916 --> 45:19.016
Oh, no!

45:21.516 --> 45:22.916
Four silly dollars.

45:24.416 --> 45:25.816
We're awfully sorry.

45:25.916 --> 45:28.316
We'll have to come back some other time.

45:30.016 --> 45:31.916
I'd gladly give you a check.

45:33.016 --> 45:34.616
But then you hardly know me.

45:34.616 --> 45:36.916
We're really grateful for your courtesy.

45:37.016 --> 45:39.916
- If it's a personal check, perhaps.
- You're sure?

45:40.016 --> 45:42.916
- I wouldn't want to inconvenience you.
- Perfectly all right.

45:43.016 --> 45:44.616
Which bank would you like?

45:44.716 --> 45:46.716
It's immaterial, I'm sure.

45:48.116 --> 45:52.016
My driver's license, identity card,
insurance card, country club...

45:53.016 --> 45:54.616
She's a private number.

45:55.116 --> 45:57.916
- Was that $192?
- And $0.70.

45:58.816 --> 46:00.816
Would you care if I...

46:00.816 --> 46:02.814
- Never mind.
- No, please.

46:03.614 --> 46:05.714
Well, I could use a little loose change.

46:05.714 --> 46:06.614
I see.

46:06.614 --> 46:10.114
Suppose I just make this out for $280...

46:10.514 --> 46:12.314
...and $0.70, of course.

46:13.314 --> 46:14.714
Well, I suppose.

46:15.214 --> 46:19.114
Mr. Sharp, you're a brick.

46:24.114 --> 46:26.414
You're good. You're really good.

46:27.314 --> 46:30.614
Smooth. No sweat. No strain.

46:31.014 --> 46:32.914
- You're an artist, boy.
- Right.

46:33.214 --> 46:36.114
If you're getting married,
you need a wedding ring.

46:36.114 --> 46:38.014
- Why not two of them?
- Why not?

46:38.014 --> 46:41.914
Cameras, diamond rings, TV sets
are the easiest things to hock or sell.

47:35.011 --> 47:37.711
You know, there's got to be
something wrong with us...

47:37.711 --> 47:39.311
...to do what we did.

47:39.811 --> 47:43.311
Nobody, but nobody,
ever gets away with a thing like that.

47:43.411 --> 47:45.111
Will you shut up about it?

47:46.311 --> 47:49.811
I can't shake this feeling
that we forgot something that night.

47:50.911 --> 47:54.311
I don't know what,
something that belongs to us.

47:54.911 --> 47:58.511
You want to go back to that house
and look for whatever the hell it is?

47:58.611 --> 48:02.711
Because that would make us
not only crazy, but insane.

48:27.810 --> 48:28.710
Any luck?

48:28.810 --> 48:31.710
If they didn't leave any fingerprints,
you can be sure...

48:31.810 --> 48:33.810
...they didn't leave any murder weapons.

49:01.910 --> 49:04.709
People who used to work for Clutter,
going back 15 years.

49:04.709 --> 49:07.509
Hired men,
people he used to do business with...

49:10.709 --> 49:12.509
- Just keep talking.
- Upstairs?

49:14.109 --> 49:15.409
Don't look up.

49:15.709 --> 49:18.609
- See something?
- I'm not sure.

49:19.909 --> 49:23.909
Now you take the office side
and I'll go around the kitchen side.

49:58.908 --> 50:00.808
It's true, really true.

50:01.008 --> 50:03.807
We're on our way
and never coming back, never.

50:04.507 --> 50:05.907
And no regrets.

50:06.007 --> 50:08.307
For you. You are leaving nothing.

50:09.407 --> 50:12.207
What about my old man? And my mother.

50:13.007 --> 50:15.707
They'll still be there
when my checks start bouncing.

50:15.807 --> 50:18.307
It's nice the way
you think about your folks.

50:19.407 --> 50:21.507
I'm a real thoughtful bastard.

50:35.906 --> 50:38.406
'Morning, Bess. Coffee?

50:39.206 --> 50:41.806
Hey, Alvin,
that prowler at the Clutter house...

50:41.906 --> 50:44.006
...get a confession out of him yet?
- Yep.

50:44.106 --> 50:47.406
His confession proved he didn't do it:
Escaped mental patient.

50:47.406 --> 50:51.106
If he's the wrong one,
why in hell don't you find the right one?

50:51.106 --> 50:55.206
I've got a house full of women
who are afraid to go to the toilet alone.

50:56.706 --> 51:00.706
Bunch of gabby old women gassing away,
scaring each other.

51:01.006 --> 51:05.306
Somebody with a grudge done it.
Somebody who hated the Clutters.

51:05.406 --> 51:08.606
Nobody asked you.
Nobody hated the Clutters.

51:09.006 --> 51:11.206
Leastways, nobody that knew them.

51:11.306 --> 51:12.406
Phone.

51:15.606 --> 51:19.406
If this can happen to a decent,
God-fearing family...

51:19.506 --> 51:20.706
...who's safe anymore?

51:22.604 --> 51:23.804
Hello?

51:25.004 --> 51:27.504
- From here?
- No, from Topeka. It's urgent!

51:31.804 --> 51:33.304
Okay, Mr. Sandrew.

51:34.104 --> 51:36.504
Tell Alvin it's a prisoner. In Lancing.

51:37.404 --> 51:41.904
Get me a rap sheet on this man, please.
He mentioned the Clutter case.

51:42.804 --> 51:46.404
He wouldn't say any more
unless he was called out of the cellblock.

51:46.804 --> 51:50.404
I have the warden on the other phone now.
Might be a break.

51:51.104 --> 51:54.304
If it is, I'll be out to Garden City tonight
with the tape.

51:54.504 --> 51:56.204
No, phone's too risky.

51:58.904 --> 52:00.204
Hello? Yes.

52:01.904 --> 52:06.504
"KSP 1-4-3-2-3. Floyd Wells."

52:12.203 --> 52:14.803
<i>- I first met him in the penitentiary.
- Hickock?</i>

52:15.303 --> 52:17.503
<i>Yes, sir. We shared the same cell.</i>

52:17.903 --> 52:19.203
<i>Go ahead, Floyd.</i>

52:21.103 --> 52:23.703
<i>We swapped life stories and I told him...</i>

52:23.803 --> 52:26.203
<i>... how I once worked
for a farmer named Clutter.</i>

52:26.703 --> 52:28.203
<i>Did you work for him?</i>

52:28.603 --> 52:30.603
<i>Yes, sir. Ten, eleven years ago.</i>

52:31.103 --> 52:34.603
<i>Dick wanted to know if Mr. Clutter
was rich and I said, "Well...</i>

52:34.603 --> 52:39.003
<i>"...sometimes it cost him $10,000
a week to run his operation."</i>

52:39.403 --> 52:42.802
<i>After that, Dick never let up.
Just kept asking questions.</i>

52:43.602 --> 52:46.502
<i>How many was in the family?
Did Clutter keep a safe?</i>

52:46.602 --> 52:49.502
<i>Dick said how he was going
to rob the Clutter place...</i>

52:49.602 --> 52:50.902
<i>... him and his buddy.</i>

52:51.002 --> 52:53.501
<i>And how he was gonna kill
all the witnesses.</i>

52:53.901 --> 52:56.401
<i>I just never believed him.
I thought it was just...</i>

52:56.801 --> 52:59.001
What took him so long to speak up?

52:59.101 --> 53:02.701
Afraid of other prisoners.
Issue a pickup warrant.

53:03.201 --> 53:04.901
All points bulletin.

53:05.001 --> 53:08.301
We better make it for parole violation,
passing bad checks.

53:08.401 --> 53:10.701
If they know they're wanted for murder...

53:10.701 --> 53:13.901
- Yeah.
- The question is why they did it.

53:15.201 --> 53:17.901
Why did Cain kill Abel? And who cares?

53:18.801 --> 53:21.201
They did it, and they'll swing for it.

53:23.601 --> 53:26.801
If they did it and if we can prove it.

53:29.701 --> 53:32.201
When we cross this bridge,
we're in Mexico.

53:32.301 --> 53:34.101
Free, clear and safe.

53:34.801 --> 53:37.301
Fabulous Mexico.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.300
Mr. Smith?

54:01.200 --> 54:02.700
Mr. Tex Smith?

54:02.900 --> 54:05.600
- Cops?
- Kansas Bureau of Investigation.

54:10.800 --> 54:13.400
Is this your son, Perry?

54:22.000 --> 54:23.800
Yep, that's him all right.

54:25.099 --> 54:27.099
Gets his looks from his mother.

54:27.899 --> 54:29.399
Part Cherokee.

54:29.799 --> 54:32.999
- Will you have some coffee?
- When did you see him last?

54:33.499 --> 54:36.099
- Couple of years ago.
- In prison?

54:37.399 --> 54:40.599
I was just fixing to make some grub.
You want some eats?

54:40.899 --> 54:44.899
He was in for three and a half years.
He's been out on parole for six months.

54:44.999 --> 54:48.099
Well, then I guess I haven't seen him
for five or six years.

54:48.199 --> 54:51.199
That's not surprising though.
He's a lone wolf just like me.

54:51.199 --> 54:53.199
You can rest easy on one thing sure...

54:53.199 --> 54:55.599
...you won't be having
any more trouble with Perry.

54:55.599 --> 54:57.599
He's learned his lesson for sure.

54:57.599 --> 55:00.299
When he wrote me from prison,
I wrote him back pronto.

55:00.399 --> 55:02.699
"Boy, you take your punishment
with a smile.

55:02.699 --> 55:05.199
"I didn't raise you to steal,
so don't expect me to cry...

55:05.299 --> 55:07.699
"...because you got it tough
behind the bars."

55:07.799 --> 55:10.298
Perry's no fool. He knows when he's beat.

55:10.998 --> 55:14.198
You fellows have got him whipped forever.
The law's the boss.

55:14.298 --> 55:16.598
He knows the difference
between right and wrong.

55:16.698 --> 55:19.598
I taught my kids a golden rule:
Always tell the truth...

55:19.698 --> 55:22.297
...wash in the morning,
be sober and independent.

55:22.297 --> 55:23.697
I showed him how.

55:23.797 --> 55:27.397
How to prospect, how to trap fur,
how to carpenter, how to bake bread...

55:27.397 --> 55:29.097
...how to be his own boss.

55:30.397 --> 55:33.197
Yes, he's a chip off the old block, all right.

55:33.697 --> 55:38.297
I never had no trouble with my kids,
not as long as Flo and me was together.

55:39.497 --> 55:41.397
But she wanted the wild life.

55:41.997 --> 55:45.297
So she took the kids and ran off.
Turned them against me.

55:45.397 --> 55:46.697
All but Perry.

55:47.697 --> 55:49.497
I don't know what got into her.

55:49.497 --> 55:52.297
She started drinking.
Turned into a hopeless drunk.

55:52.297 --> 55:55.896
Started stepping out with young men.
I caught her once and I...

55:59.496 --> 56:01.096
Anyway, she died drunk.

56:01.896 --> 56:03.996
Choked to death on her own vomit.

56:04.696 --> 56:08.396
So I took Perry and we started roaming
to forget it all.

56:12.396 --> 56:14.396
I took him with me everywhere.

56:20.896 --> 56:22.796
How that boy loved me.

56:27.596 --> 56:29.796
At night, when it was cold...

56:32.696 --> 56:34.396
...we'd sleep cuddled up.

56:37.196 --> 56:41.594
He'd hang onto me with his little arms,
so tight.

56:46.594 --> 56:50.694
I'd tell him stories about
the great adventures we was gonna have.

56:55.294 --> 56:58.194
How we was gonna strike it rich.

57:01.794 --> 57:03.394
Buried treasures.

57:06.994 --> 57:08.094
Gold.

57:10.494 --> 57:11.894
In Alaska.

57:18.594 --> 57:22.094
That's where this picture was took.
Him and me in Alaska.

57:26.693 --> 57:29.693
You just ask Perry if I wasn't
a good father to him.

57:29.893 --> 57:33.293
I always shared, always.
When I eat, he eats.

57:34.693 --> 57:38.493
You just tell Perry,
when I die all my insurance goes to him.

57:44.493 --> 57:45.793
Yes, sir.

57:47.693 --> 57:49.393
His life is all set.

57:53.693 --> 57:54.993
Great news!

57:55.793 --> 57:58.493
I met this kid. He's a shoeshine boy.

58:00.893 --> 58:03.792
He's got a cousin in Yucatan, a fisherman.

58:04.092 --> 58:06.792
- And he's got a powerboat.
- So?

58:07.592 --> 58:11.792
So, we drive to Yucatan, we sell the car...

58:12.192 --> 58:14.891
...buy us a load of deepsea diving gear...

58:14.891 --> 58:18.791
...and "pow," we hit the Cortés jackpot.

58:19.891 --> 58:23.191
$60 million in Spanish gold.

58:25.291 --> 58:29.491
Of course, we'll have to cut the kid in,
and his cousin, too.

58:31.891 --> 58:36.291
But even so, Yucatan!

58:37.391 --> 58:40.291
Hot, dry, clean...

58:41.191 --> 58:43.791
...no crowd, no noise.

58:45.291 --> 58:47.291
Doing what we came to do.

58:47.991 --> 58:51.191
- How much can we get for the car?
- $120.

58:51.291 --> 58:52.491
Is that all?

58:53.291 --> 58:56.891
Enough to pay the bills.
Hotel, bar, groceries.

58:57.291 --> 59:01.090
And with what's left over,
I bought us two bus tickets...

59:01.190 --> 59:05.490
...as far as Barstow, California.
After that, we walk.

59:06.090 --> 59:08.890
So get rid of that ton and a half of garbage.

59:08.990 --> 59:12.290
Ship it! Dump it! Burn it! I don't care.

59:12.790 --> 59:16.290
Only get rid of it, by tonight.
'Cause come tomorrow, we're gone.

59:16.790 --> 59:19.790
- Back to the States.
- Now listen.

59:19.990 --> 59:21.590
You listen! I've had it!

59:21.590 --> 59:24.690
You, your maps, fishing boats,
buried treasure, all of it!

59:24.690 --> 59:26.790
Everything! Stop jacking off.

59:26.890 --> 59:29.790
There isn't any caskets of gold.
No buried treasure.

59:30.490 --> 59:34.490
And even if there was, hell, boy,
you can't even swim.

59:36.890 --> 59:39.490
You want to stick with me, okay.

59:40.590 --> 59:43.490
You wanna split, that's okay, too.

59:44.889 --> 59:46.789
Only make up your mind.

59:50.089 --> 59:53.089
- I'll ship our stuff back to Vegas.
- Good.

59:54.889 --> 59:57.489
<i>I got a little se? Orita coming over tonight.</i>

59:58.489 --> 01:00:01.389
I'll try to be finished packing
before you get back.

01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:04.389
What for? Hell, I'm not bashful, baby.

01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:12.289
And that, if we find the motive,
we find the killer.

01:00:12.889 --> 01:00:13.889
If.

01:00:16.289 --> 01:00:19.189
This report was written six months...

01:00:19.289 --> 01:00:21.889
...before the Clutters were killed.

01:00:22.689 --> 01:00:25.989
<i>It's called,
Murder Without Apparent Motive.</i>

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:29.389
At the Menninger Clinic,
right here in Kansas...

01:00:29.488 --> 01:00:31.988
...a study was made of four killers.

01:00:32.888 --> 01:00:35.188
They all had certain things in common.

01:00:35.388 --> 01:00:37.988
They all committed senseless murders.

01:00:38.588 --> 01:00:42.987
They all felt physically inferior
and sexually inadequate.

01:00:44.287 --> 01:00:48.187
Their childhood was violent,
or one parent was missing.

01:00:48.787 --> 01:00:51.087
Or someone else had raised them.

01:00:52.487 --> 01:00:56.387
They couldn't distinguish
between fantasy and reality.

01:00:57.987 --> 01:01:00.887
They didn't hate their victims,
they didn't even know them.

01:01:00.987 --> 01:01:04.887
They felt no guilt about their crime,
and got nothing out of it.

01:01:05.687 --> 01:01:10.187
And most important,
they told the police or a psychiatrist...

01:01:11.387 --> 01:01:16.186
...that they felt the urge to kill,
before they committed murder.

01:01:17.186 --> 01:01:19.486
Their warnings were disregarded.

01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:29.086
So, who killed the Clutters?

01:01:34.586 --> 01:01:38.186
Someday, somebody will explain
to me the motive of a newspaper.

01:01:38.986 --> 01:01:41.686
First you scream, "Find the bastards."

01:01:41.886 --> 01:01:44.686
Till we find them you want to get us fired.

01:01:44.786 --> 01:01:47.686
When we find them,
you accuse us of brutality.

01:01:49.086 --> 01:01:52.586
Before we can go into court,
you give them a trial by newspaper.

01:01:53.486 --> 01:01:56.586
When we finally get a conviction
you want to save them...

01:01:56.686 --> 01:01:59.486
...by proving they were crazy
in the first place.

01:01:59.886 --> 01:02:03.784
All of which adds up to one thing:
You've got the killers.

01:02:05.484 --> 01:02:07.884
Off the record, have you got them?

01:02:09.984 --> 01:02:11.184
Suspects.

01:02:11.584 --> 01:02:13.884
Even if we catch them, that's all we've got.

01:02:15.284 --> 01:02:20.284
Because without a confession, the evidence
we got so far, we couldn't go to trial.

01:02:22.084 --> 01:02:25.184
Unless we can place the suspects
in this spot...

01:02:25.684 --> 01:02:29.284
...unless we can tie the killers
to that piece of rope...

01:02:29.684 --> 01:02:31.184
...they'll never hang.

01:03:59.481 --> 01:04:02.681
<i>Perry!</i>

01:06:36.276 --> 01:06:37.876
Was it good, baby?

01:06:39.276 --> 01:06:40.276
Was it good?

01:06:41.976 --> 01:06:43.976
Baby, was it really good?

01:07:17.876 --> 01:07:20.376
All a truck gets us, is from here to there.

01:07:21.074 --> 01:07:22.674
We want a score.

01:07:22.874 --> 01:07:27.174
One guy with a fat wallet,
in a fast car, with a back seat.

01:07:27.774 --> 01:07:29.374
I sit beside him.

01:07:29.774 --> 01:07:32.274
You get in the back, I feed him a few jokes.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.974
I say, "Hey, Perry, pass me a match."

01:07:36.674 --> 01:07:37.874
That's your signal.

01:07:37.874 --> 01:07:40.474
Fast. Hard. Snap. I grab the wheel.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.274
You're so good at it,
you sit in the back seat.

01:07:44.474 --> 01:07:45.874
You do it.

01:07:50.074 --> 01:07:51.774
Look friendly, now.

01:08:07.973 --> 01:08:09.873
You're a lucky bastard.

01:08:20.573 --> 01:08:23.473
Don't forget,
when I say, "Pass me a match."

01:08:23.473 --> 01:08:26.473
- Hop in boys. Where are you going?
- Come on. Get in.

01:08:27.173 --> 01:08:28.673
Not with you.

01:08:31.473 --> 01:08:33.173
Thanks just the same.

01:08:33.573 --> 01:08:35.073
Did you see them guys?

01:08:35.173 --> 01:08:37.473
Jesus! They could've robbed us.

01:08:38.273 --> 01:08:39.473
What of?

01:08:51.072 --> 01:08:54.270
I'm really not supposed to pick up anybody
in the company car, but...

01:08:54.371 --> 01:08:57.970
- What the hell, you only live once.
- That's what they say.

01:08:59.071 --> 01:09:00.571
Comfortable back there?

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.171
I can take you as far as lowa.

01:09:05.371 --> 01:09:06.671
Where have you boys been?

01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:09.071
Mexico. No future there.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.470
That depends, my boy.

01:09:12.071 --> 01:09:14.071
I honeymooned in Mexico.

01:09:14.671 --> 01:09:18.871
You might say that's where I planted
the seed of our first child.

01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:23.171
<i>I plowed and planted
a few se? Oritas there myself.</i>

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:31.171
You know what they call a prostitute
who went to college?

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:32.270
What?

01:09:33.371 --> 01:09:35.270
A whore-to-culture.

01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:39.970
I got a riddle for you.

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:41.370
- Ready?
- Shoot.

01:09:42.069 --> 01:09:46.970
Why is a trip to the bathroom
exactly like a trip to the cemetery?

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:51.370
Let me see. A trip to the bathroom...

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:54.870
...like a trip to the cemetery...

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:57.870
Give up?

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:01.570
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:04.170
Perry, pass me a match.

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:16.770
Sorry, I never turn down a soldier.

01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:19.070
This might get the boy home
for Christmas.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:20.370
Lucky break.

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:23.070
Practically a goddamn miracle.

01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:29.469
You didn't happen to see a portable radio,
Mr. Hickock, about so big?

01:10:30.369 --> 01:10:31.569
A Zenith?

01:10:32.869 --> 01:10:32.969
Now what makes him do it?

01:10:32.969 --> 01:10:34.869
Now what makes him do it?

01:10:35.869 --> 01:10:37.769
Hit out against people?

01:10:38.569 --> 01:10:44.169
Outstanding athlete in basketball, baseball,
football, always made the first team.

01:10:44.569 --> 01:10:49.169
He always played to win,
played hard, but clean.

01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:56.369
When he left without a word
I knew he was in trouble again.

01:10:56.769 --> 01:11:00.969
Now, Mr. Nye, I thought if I...
About breaking parole.

01:11:01.069 --> 01:11:03.269
Will he have to go back to prison?

01:11:08.869 --> 01:11:11.268
You do much hunting, Mr. Hickock?

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:14.568
That's his gun. Dick's.

01:11:19.368 --> 01:11:21.967
When he come outta prison...

01:11:22.367 --> 01:11:25.867
...you know, folks was saying
how he'd turned mean.

01:11:26.967 --> 01:11:30.567
Now how'd they know?
How'd anybody know...

01:11:31.167 --> 01:11:33.567
...what's inside another person?

01:11:35.467 --> 01:11:40.567
I haven't got long to go, Mr. Nye.
I'm with cancer.

01:11:41.767 --> 01:11:43.667
Dick knowed that.

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:48.367
Well, before he left, he said to me:

01:11:48.967 --> 01:11:53.567
"Pa, I'm not ever gonna do anything
to hurt you."

01:11:53.967 --> 01:11:55.766
And he meant it, too.

01:11:56.466 --> 01:12:00.466
If you'd seen him,
you know, playing with his children.

01:12:01.966 --> 01:12:06.366
Any boy that loves and respects his folks,
well, you know...

01:12:07.066 --> 01:12:09.466
...there's good inside that boy.

01:12:11.066 --> 01:12:14.866
I hope you find him, Mr. Nye,
for his own sake. Before it's too late.

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.864
You know what we are?

01:12:52.164 --> 01:12:55.664
We're the living proof that crime pays.

01:13:03.964 --> 01:13:05.664
Gifts in a manger.

01:13:08.264 --> 01:13:10.164
No more money troubles.

01:13:10.664 --> 01:13:12.264
Merry Christmas.

01:13:13.164 --> 01:13:15.464
Kansas City, here we come.

01:13:16.464 --> 01:13:17.964
You're crazy.

01:13:19.364 --> 01:13:20.764
I gotta get us some money.

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:23.964
How far do you think we could get
in a hot car? With hot checks?

01:13:24.464 --> 01:13:26.763
That's right. I'll go by myself.

01:13:27.863 --> 01:13:30.563
- Like hell you will.
- I'll meet you later.

01:13:32.063 --> 01:13:33.663
We stick together.

01:13:33.763 --> 01:13:36.263
First we go to Vegas.
We pick up our clothes.

01:13:36.363 --> 01:13:38.863
All the stuff I shipped from Mexico.
And then...

01:13:38.963 --> 01:13:43.163
...we drive to the nearest port and ship out
on the first tanker leaving this country.

01:13:43.263 --> 01:13:45.463
And this time we stay out.

01:13:45.563 --> 01:13:46.663
I won't go.

01:13:47.163 --> 01:13:48.463
You'll go.

01:13:48.663 --> 01:13:50.363
What if I don't?

01:13:52.463 --> 01:13:55.363
Well, then, "honey, baby"...

01:13:57.263 --> 01:13:59.863
...I guess I'll just have to kill you.

01:14:00.462 --> 01:14:03.662
Yeah. But right now...

01:14:04.762 --> 01:14:07.262
...we pass a lot of fast, hot checks.

01:14:22.061 --> 01:14:25.561
One more check.
We can be in and out of here in an hour.

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:27.561
A cinch.

01:14:28.561 --> 01:14:30.461
Stop worrying, will you?

01:14:31.861 --> 01:14:33.861
Al, our friends are here.

01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:35.961
How do you know?

01:14:36.061 --> 01:14:39.361
<i>They stole a car in lowa and bought
two tires with a bad check.</i>

01:14:39.361 --> 01:14:40.161
Where?

01:14:40.161 --> 01:14:43.961
Right here. The salesman got worried
and wrote down the license.

01:14:44.261 --> 01:14:46.061
The Hickock farm, is it covered?

01:14:46.761 --> 01:14:49.061
If they go there, we're covered.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.060
I'll be at the Hickock farm.

01:15:50.259 --> 01:15:51.259
Yes?

01:15:51.359 --> 01:15:52.359
Yes.

01:15:58.259 --> 01:16:00.159
Did they slip through?

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:07.259
If it wasn't to see his folks,
why would they come back to Kansas?

01:16:08.059 --> 01:16:11.659
Maybe they're trying to be caught.

01:16:12.759 --> 01:16:15.559
I guess they'll just have to try harder.

01:16:38.058 --> 01:16:40.257
You're not stopping for them?

01:16:44.357 --> 01:16:46.957
Look at that old man, he looks awful.

01:16:47.257 --> 01:16:50.557
Suppose he dies on us?
That means cops, questions.

01:16:50.657 --> 01:16:52.057
Think, will you?

01:16:52.257 --> 01:16:54.757
I think you're a bastard.

01:17:00.357 --> 01:17:02.157
We sure appreciate this, mister.

01:17:02.157 --> 01:17:03.357
Get in.

01:17:04.057 --> 01:17:05.157
Where you headed?

01:17:05.357 --> 01:17:09.457
California. Gramps has got a sister
in Needles. He's going to stay with her.

01:17:09.857 --> 01:17:11.257
Did you hear that, Johnny?

01:17:12.057 --> 01:17:13.657
Hear me, Johnny?

01:17:13.757 --> 01:17:15.456
You got any money?

01:17:16.056 --> 01:17:17.956
- Hey, kid.
- No, sir.

01:17:19.156 --> 01:17:21.156
Not even $1 for gas?

01:17:23.656 --> 01:17:24.956
Only these.

01:17:34.156 --> 01:17:36.756
- They're worth $0.03 a bottle.
- So?

01:17:38.156 --> 01:17:43.156
If you was to drive real slow,
we could pick us up some real change.

01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:47.056
That's what Johnny and me
have been eating off of. Refund money.

01:17:49.856 --> 01:17:51.056
Get in.

01:17:54.556 --> 01:17:56.356
We finally found it.

01:17:56.856 --> 01:18:00.454
The sunken treasure of Captain Cortés.

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:05.854
$0.03 a bottle.

01:19:07.153 --> 01:19:08.453
Pay dirt!

01:19:11.353 --> 01:19:13.753
<i>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.</i>

01:19:31.951 --> 01:19:36.751
Mister, $12.60. Fifty-fifty okay?

01:19:36.851 --> 01:19:38.951
Kid, you're a positive genius.

01:19:39.051 --> 01:19:40.551
- Happy New Year!
- Likewise.

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:42.551
Keep digging, old-timer.

01:20:03.251 --> 01:20:05.551
Never seen so much blonde chicken.

01:20:06.151 --> 01:20:08.451
And all that sweet divorce money.

01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:21.650
Hey, Chief...

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:23.650
...you a lucky crap shooter?

01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:26.450
Deuces, treys, and twelves.

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:28.550
Mr. Snake Eyes himself.

01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:31.550
If we put this fiver on the line...

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:33.550
...and if we let it ride.

01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:35.950
If we make only 10 passes...

01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:39.350
...we'd have over $5,000.

01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:43.150
How about it, honey?
I feel real lucky tonight.

01:21:06.349 --> 01:21:08.049
You've got visitors.

01:21:29.549 --> 01:21:30.549
Hello.

01:21:30.749 --> 01:21:34.949
Hey, buddy.
Put in a call for that big old yellow bird.

01:22:00.447 --> 01:22:02.447
Good afternoon.

01:22:02.847 --> 01:22:04.747
- Smith.
- Hickock.

01:22:27.047 --> 01:22:28.347
Comedian.

01:22:40.546 --> 01:22:42.446
Are they still virgins?

01:22:43.046 --> 01:22:46.346
- What'd you charge them with?
- Driving a hot car.

01:22:52.346 --> 01:22:53.546
Officer.

01:23:01.446 --> 01:23:04.646
- You know why we're here, Mr. Hickock?
- Sir...

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:06.446
...you can call me Dick.

01:23:07.246 --> 01:23:08.746
All right, Dick.

01:23:09.146 --> 01:23:11.546
We understand you've signed
the extradition papers.

01:23:11.646 --> 01:23:13.446
Well, what the hell.

01:23:13.846 --> 01:23:17.246
There's no denying we broke parole
and hung a mile and half of paper.

01:23:17.946 --> 01:23:20.144
Oh, yeah, the car...

01:23:21.044 --> 01:23:22.444
...it's stolen.

01:23:22.844 --> 01:23:24.644
That's it. All of it.

01:23:25.044 --> 01:23:26.644
- Okay if I smoke?
- Sure.

01:23:29.144 --> 01:23:31.044
In a way, I'm glad it's over.

01:23:31.044 --> 01:23:34.544
I'll take what I've got coming.
Serve my time and never...

01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:36.844
...but never again.

01:23:44.344 --> 01:23:48.144
Your parole has a special provision
never to return to Kansas.

01:23:48.144 --> 01:23:49.744
I cried my eyes out.

01:23:50.144 --> 01:23:53.344
Must've been something important
to bring you back.

01:23:55.744 --> 01:23:58.244
I had to see my sister in Fort Scott.

01:23:59.044 --> 01:24:02.544
- To get money she was holding for me.
- Did you get it?

01:24:05.244 --> 01:24:07.743
- She moved away.
- Where?

01:24:09.143 --> 01:24:10.543
I don't know.

01:24:10.743 --> 01:24:13.643
How far is it
from Kansas City to Fort Scott?

01:24:17.043 --> 01:24:17.943
I don't know.

01:24:18.043 --> 01:24:21.243
How long did it take you to drive there,
one hour? Two?

01:24:21.543 --> 01:24:23.443
Three? Four?

01:24:23.843 --> 01:24:24.943
I can't remember.

01:24:26.043 --> 01:24:27.843
Do you remember what day it was?

01:24:28.043 --> 01:24:29.043
Saturday.

01:24:29.143 --> 01:24:31.243
Yeah, I remember now.

01:24:31.443 --> 01:24:33.743
We got to Fort Scott about 4:00 p.m.

01:24:33.943 --> 01:24:36.643
- We went right to the post office.
- Why?

01:24:36.743 --> 01:24:37.743
Why?

01:24:38.143 --> 01:24:40.742
To find out where Perry's sister lived.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:42.942
The guy at the post office said she moved.

01:24:43.042 --> 01:24:45.142
Left no address and left no money, either.

01:24:45.242 --> 01:24:47.742
- Must've been quite a blow.
- It was a haymaker.

01:24:49.442 --> 01:24:51.241
What did you do then?

01:24:51.641 --> 01:24:54.541
Drove back to K.C., went prowling.

01:24:55.041 --> 01:24:56.341
Any luck?

01:24:57.141 --> 01:24:59.741
Not much.
We ended up with a couple of hustlers.

01:24:59.841 --> 01:25:00.741
Named?

01:25:01.141 --> 01:25:02.541
I never asked.

01:25:06.841 --> 01:25:10.641
You spent the night with these women
and you didn't ask their names?

01:25:11.141 --> 01:25:12.741
They were just prostitutes.

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:14.641
Where'd you take them?

01:25:16.541 --> 01:25:19.941
I don't remember junk like that.
You'll have to ask Dick.

01:25:21.741 --> 01:25:23.941
What did these girls look like?

01:25:24.441 --> 01:25:25.941
Describe them.

01:25:26.441 --> 01:25:28.541
Blonde? Dark? Big? Little?

01:25:28.741 --> 01:25:30.041
Any scars?

01:25:30.941 --> 01:25:33.141
Moles? Marks?

01:25:35.641 --> 01:25:37.640
Would you like the sordid details?

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:39.040
Anything.

01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:44.040
Is that how you get your kicks?

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.140
She had to be a contortionist.

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.740
I guess you know why we're really here?

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:55.540
You know we wouldn't have come this far
just to arrest two-bit check chiselers.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.040
Would we, Dick?

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.940
- I wasn't listening.
- Are you listening now?

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.740
Did you ever hear
of the Clutter murder case?

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:06.040
Can't nobody pin any murder on me.
No, sir.

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:10.540
- The question was: Did you hear about it?
- Read something about it, maybe.

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.340
You made three mistakes.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.840
Number one: You left a witness.

01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:18.040
A living witness, who'll testify in court.

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:20.340
There ain't any living witness. Can't be.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.440
Nobody can pin any murder on me.

01:26:22.639 --> 01:26:25.139
Saturday, November 14,
you drove to Fort Scott.

01:26:25.139 --> 01:26:28.239
You went to the post office
to get the address of Perry's sister.

01:26:28.339 --> 01:26:29.339
That's right.

01:26:36.539 --> 01:26:39.939
Perry Smith has no sister in Fort Scott.
Never has had.

01:26:40.839 --> 01:26:45.639
On Saturday afternoon the post office
in Fort Scott is always closed.

01:26:46.139 --> 01:26:49.339
That is your second mistake.

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:53.939
Perry seems confused about that night.

01:26:54.039 --> 01:26:56.439
I think it's about time
we straightened him out.

01:26:56.639 --> 01:26:58.939
Yes, sir. About time.

01:26:59.439 --> 01:27:01.039
Look at me, boy.

01:27:04.839 --> 01:27:09.138
On Saturday night, November 14,
you were in Holcomb, Kansas.

01:27:10.738 --> 01:27:13.338
You were killing the Clutter family.

01:27:14.838 --> 01:27:15.938
Never.

01:27:16.938 --> 01:27:18.738
- I never...
- Never what?

01:27:20.037 --> 01:27:22.837
I never knew anybody by that name...

01:27:23.637 --> 01:27:26.537
...Clutter.
- We've got a living witness.

01:27:38.437 --> 01:27:40.037
Well, Perry?

01:27:42.437 --> 01:27:44.337
Do you have any aspirin?

01:27:45.037 --> 01:27:46.537
They took my aspirin away.

01:27:46.737 --> 01:27:48.137
Feeling bad?

01:27:50.037 --> 01:27:51.437
My legs do.

01:27:57.136 --> 01:27:59.736
By the way, you know what tomorrow is?

01:28:00.936 --> 01:28:02.936
Nancy Clutter's birthday.

01:28:03.436 --> 01:28:04.836
She would have been 17.

01:28:09.536 --> 01:28:11.636
You guys have gotta be stalling.

01:28:12.036 --> 01:28:15.536
If you had any real proof...
Real proof, as in eyewitness.

01:28:16.236 --> 01:28:17.736
Fingerprints.

01:28:22.136 --> 01:28:25.236
As God is my witness,
may I burn in hell forever...

01:28:25.336 --> 01:28:26.836
...if I ever killed anybody.

01:28:26.936 --> 01:28:28.436
Careful, boy.

01:28:33.436 --> 01:28:34.936
Got an aspirin?

01:28:39.236 --> 01:28:40.734
How's it going?

01:28:41.034 --> 01:28:43.134
Three hours and all we've got so far is:

01:28:43.234 --> 01:28:45.734
"No. I don't remember. Ask Dick."

01:28:46.534 --> 01:28:50.834
We've caught that hard-nosed little punk
in 50 lies and he still admits nothing.

01:28:59.134 --> 01:29:01.834
I think our boy's about primed and ready.

01:29:02.734 --> 01:29:04.534
I hope you're right.

01:29:12.234 --> 01:29:14.634
Why do all you people get tattooed?

01:29:17.234 --> 01:29:18.534
"All you people"?

01:29:20.134 --> 01:29:23.434
- What people?
- Convicts. You're all tattooed.

01:29:23.934 --> 01:29:27.833
That tiger head. What does it do?
Make you feel tough?

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:36.933
That cop's badge, what does it do?
Make you feel honest?

01:29:37.933 --> 01:29:39.733
Everybody's got a tattoo.

01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:41.933
Only you people call them clubs.

01:29:42.233 --> 01:29:47.033
Elks, Masons, Boy Scouts. Salute.
High sign. Low sign.

01:29:47.233 --> 01:29:50.933
Secret this and secret that.
"No trespassing. Keep off the grass."

01:29:51.233 --> 01:29:53.633
Nice, respectable, tattoo clubs.

01:29:54.133 --> 01:29:58.033
Poker clubs, golf clubs, tennis clubs.

01:29:58.033 --> 01:30:00.832
Clubs for gambling and clubs for drinking.

01:30:01.432 --> 01:30:04.432
Even a real club like Daddy-O's got
in that little brown bag.

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:07.532
What you gonna do, pappy?
Club it out of me?

01:30:08.832 --> 01:30:10.432
Something like that.

01:30:10.532 --> 01:30:12.831
I said you made three mistakes.

01:30:13.231 --> 01:30:15.631
First, you left a living witness.

01:30:16.131 --> 01:30:18.431
Second, your alibi won't hold water.

01:30:18.531 --> 01:30:19.831
And third?

01:30:20.731 --> 01:30:22.031
Coming up.

01:30:24.431 --> 01:30:25.831
Footprints.

01:30:27.731 --> 01:30:30.831
Made in the spot
where Mr. Clutter was murdered.

01:30:33.031 --> 01:30:35.531
These are the shoes that made them.

01:30:38.031 --> 01:30:39.231
Yours.

01:30:42.431 --> 01:30:43.731
This footprint...

01:30:45.331 --> 01:30:47.631
...was made in Mr. Clutter's blood.

01:30:48.931 --> 01:30:50.331
Perry's shoe.

01:30:50.931 --> 01:30:54.531
Same cat's paw. Same size. Same blood.

01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:05.430
All right, Dick. This time the truth.

01:31:10.630 --> 01:31:13.430
I don't want to be charged
with murder one...

01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:16.530
...because I never pulled the trigger.

01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:20.230
I don't even know
what the goddamn hell was happening.

01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:24.130
It was Perry. He did it.

01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:28.430
I couldn't stop him.

01:31:30.730 --> 01:31:32.530
He killed them all.

01:31:54.929 --> 01:31:57.029
Are you the officer that made the arrest?

01:31:57.129 --> 01:31:59.429
If you'd grabbed them
five minutes earlier...

01:31:59.529 --> 01:32:01.929
...before they'd picked up that box...

01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:04.029
Just luck, I guess.

01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:05.229
Or something.

01:32:20.429 --> 01:32:22.829
Hickock swears that he tried to stop you.

01:32:22.929 --> 01:32:27.429
- He was scared that you'd shoot him, too.
- He said you did it. All of it.

01:32:28.728 --> 01:32:31.928
Sure. Now you'd like me to say he did it.

01:32:33.028 --> 01:32:35.328
He's no killer, and he knows it.

01:32:35.928 --> 01:32:38.928
That's why he picked you.
He needed a trigger.

01:32:39.128 --> 01:32:43.027
You had nothing to lose.
You'd already killed a man, in Vegas.

01:32:44.227 --> 01:32:46.927
Beat him to death with a bicycle chain.

01:32:56.227 --> 01:32:59.727
Tough boy. Real brass boy.

01:33:02.127 --> 01:33:04.127
I knew if we got caught...

01:33:04.827 --> 01:33:08.627
...if he dropped his guts,
he'd tell about that guy in Vegas.

01:33:10.727 --> 01:33:12.627
I never killed anybody.

01:33:14.826 --> 01:33:16.626
Not before that night.

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:21.026
'Cause that night...

01:33:29.726 --> 01:33:31.226
...I think...

01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:37.826
<i>No, I want to remember it the way it was.</i>

01:33:41.626 --> 01:33:44.826
<i>We got there around midnight.</i>

01:33:47.126 --> 01:33:48.426
This is it.

01:33:52.926 --> 01:33:54.926
Let's pull outta here.

01:33:54.926 --> 01:33:57.926
Now, before it's too late.

01:34:05.824 --> 01:34:09.324
If you're gonna do it,
you'll have to do it alone.

01:34:11.824 --> 01:34:14.324
You don't think I got the guts
to do it alone.

01:34:15.024 --> 01:34:18.324
Okay. I'll show you
who's wearing the pants.

01:34:20.624 --> 01:34:24.424
How'd you kill that guy in Vegas, anyhow?
Love him to death?

01:34:26.324 --> 01:34:28.424
Korean War hero.

01:34:28.924 --> 01:34:30.724
Christ!

01:34:43.224 --> 01:34:45.223
<i>Why"d I go along with it?</i>

01:34:46.123 --> 01:34:48.023
<i>When it first began...</i>

01:34:50.223 --> 01:34:52.923
<i>Who knows when anything really begins?</i>

01:34:54.123 --> 01:34:57.723
<i>When Dick first told me the plan
it didn"t even seem real.</i>

01:34:58.923 --> 01:35:02.423
<i>Then, the closer we got,
the more real it became.</i>

01:35:03.723 --> 01:35:08.723
<i>Like the crazy stunt had a life of its own
and nothing could stop it.</i>

01:35:10.323 --> 01:35:12.323
<i>Like I was reading a story...</i>

01:35:12.423 --> 01:35:14.923
<i>... and I had to know
what was gonna happen.</i>

01:35:15.423 --> 01:35:16.923
<i>How it would end.</i>

01:35:56.921 --> 01:35:57.921
Wait.

01:36:06.621 --> 01:36:09.421
If we find the safe,
do you know how to open it?

01:36:10.721 --> 01:36:12.821
I know somebody that knows.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.820
Honey? Is that you, honey?

01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.720
Who is it?

01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:45.120
- Come with us. Now!
- What?

01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:46.220
Come with us.

01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:57.920
In the office.

01:37:09.019 --> 01:37:10.019
Now, sir.

01:37:10.919 --> 01:37:12.719
Where do you keep that safe?

01:37:13.219 --> 01:37:16.419
What safe? I don't have any safe.

01:37:17.219 --> 01:37:19.719
Don't lie to me, you son of a bitch.

01:37:20.219 --> 01:37:24.419
I know you got a safe.
Right here. In this office.

01:37:25.219 --> 01:37:27.719
I'm sorry, but there isn't any safe.

01:37:27.919 --> 01:37:29.819
There never was a safe.

01:37:32.319 --> 01:37:33.919
Any other phones?

01:37:35.219 --> 01:37:37.019
One. In the kitchen.

01:37:42.719 --> 01:37:44.519
Unlock this cabinet.

01:37:44.619 --> 01:37:46.219
It's not locked.

01:37:56.318 --> 01:37:57.718
Where is it?

01:38:14.817 --> 01:38:16.417
Come on, move it.

01:38:20.917 --> 01:38:23.617
All right, now. The money, dig it up.

01:38:33.017 --> 01:38:35.816
Thirty-one lousy dollars.

01:38:37.816 --> 01:38:39.516
A rich man like you.

01:38:40.916 --> 01:38:42.916
You gotta have more money than this.

01:38:43.116 --> 01:38:45.716
Not in cash. I can write you a check.

01:38:47.916 --> 01:38:48.916
A check?

01:38:49.216 --> 01:38:51.816
- What kind of...
- Don't do that!

01:38:51.916 --> 01:38:54.116
- There's somebody awake upstairs.
- My family.

01:38:54.216 --> 01:38:56.116
The only people upstairs...

01:38:56.516 --> 01:38:59.616
...are my wife, my son and daughter.

01:38:59.816 --> 01:39:02.416
Your wife, she got any money?

01:39:02.616 --> 01:39:06.716
- Please, she's not well.
- Sure. Sure, pops.

01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:12.216
- Upstairs.
- My glasses. I can't see without them.

01:39:19.414 --> 01:39:20.814
Upstairs, upstairs.

01:39:28.914 --> 01:39:31.314
Why do you boys want to do this?

01:39:31.414 --> 01:39:32.914
I never harmed you.

01:39:33.914 --> 01:39:38.214
- I never saw you before.
- Shut up. We'll tell you when to talk.

01:39:45.414 --> 01:39:48.114
It's all right, sweetheart, don't be afraid.

01:39:48.214 --> 01:39:50.814
These men, they just want some money.

01:39:52.014 --> 01:39:54.214
They believe we have money
hidden in a safe.

01:39:54.314 --> 01:39:57.814
- I told them we didn't, but they don't...
- Didn't I tell you to shut up?

01:39:57.914 --> 01:40:00.814
He's telling you God's truth.
There isn't any safe.

01:40:00.914 --> 01:40:05.313
I know goddamn well you got a safe.
And you better tell him to find it fast!

01:40:11.813 --> 01:40:15.513
Floyd Wells lied to you.
There isn't any safe.

01:40:18.713 --> 01:40:20.113
Tie them up.

01:40:21.913 --> 01:40:24.513
Okay, lady. In the bathroom.

01:40:33.513 --> 01:40:35.613
Please, don't hurt anybody.

01:40:36.213 --> 01:40:39.512
They don't mean to hurt anyone.
Isn't that right?

01:40:45.312 --> 01:40:48.812
All they want is some money.
And then they'll go away.

01:40:52.111 --> 01:40:54.911
Please, don't hurt the children.

01:40:58.411 --> 01:41:01.311
Good grief! What is this?
Some kind of joke?

01:41:05.611 --> 01:41:08.711
Make one move, holler once...

01:41:09.211 --> 01:41:11.511
...and we'll cut their throats.

01:41:12.411 --> 01:41:15.211
All right. You two, downstairs.

01:41:41.710 --> 01:41:43.210
Dick! In here.

01:41:50.710 --> 01:41:52.410
You. Over there.

01:42:22.309 --> 01:42:24.809
What's this? A casket?

01:42:25.509 --> 01:42:26.809
Hope chest.

01:42:27.209 --> 01:42:29.309
It's a wedding present for my sister.

01:42:31.509 --> 01:42:33.509
Not her. She's too young.

01:42:34.609 --> 01:42:36.809
They're never too young, kid.

01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:44.309
Pops!

01:42:47.209 --> 01:42:50.109
You better pray I find that safe.

01:43:01.809 --> 01:43:03.009
Kenyon?

01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:06.709
Dad?

01:43:27.907 --> 01:43:29.207
You're cold?

01:43:29.607 --> 01:43:30.607
Yes.

01:44:01.206 --> 01:44:03.706
If all you want is money, then why?

01:44:06.306 --> 01:44:09.506
If you do that to my wife she'll panic.

01:44:47.104 --> 01:44:50.104
My mother, please be careful. Please.

01:45:17.104 --> 01:45:20.204
That other man,
I'm afraid he'll hurt someone.

01:45:21.104 --> 01:45:23.704
Please, he can have money, anything...

01:45:24.304 --> 01:45:28.103
...but, please,
don't let him hurt my little girl.

01:45:31.203 --> 01:45:32.503
Don't...

01:45:36.103 --> 01:45:37.803
You ever had a man?

01:45:38.203 --> 01:45:39.803
Please, don't.

01:45:47.103 --> 01:45:48.903
What's eating at you?

01:45:49.303 --> 01:45:51.103
You find the safe?

01:45:52.003 --> 01:45:53.603
Later.

01:45:54.103 --> 01:45:56.803
- First I'm gonna bust that little girl.
- No.

01:45:57.503 --> 01:46:00.502
What do you care? You can bust her, too.

01:46:01.502 --> 01:46:02.502
No.

01:46:04.602 --> 01:46:05.702
Okay, honey.

01:46:10.002 --> 01:46:11.801
Get the kid's radio.

01:46:13.401 --> 01:46:15.301
And then go downstairs.

01:46:28.701 --> 01:46:32.401
I despise people
who can't control themselves.

01:46:43.601 --> 01:46:45.201
You go to school?

01:46:46.301 --> 01:46:47.601
The university...

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:50.601
...next year. To study music and art.

01:46:53.101 --> 01:46:54.801
I play the guitar.

01:46:55.801 --> 01:46:57.300
Draw some, too.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Only got as far as the third grade.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.600
You like horses?

01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.400
Yes.

01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:14.100
My mother...

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.700
...was a champion rider. In the rodeo.

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.100
And my father...

01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:32.800
My father...

01:48:04.399 --> 01:48:05.699
What's the matter?

01:48:06.099 --> 01:48:10.199
Us. We're the matter. We're ridiculous.

01:48:11.799 --> 01:48:14.299
You tapping the walls
for a safe that isn't there.

01:48:14.399 --> 01:48:17.399
Tapping like some nutty woodpecker.

01:48:19.199 --> 01:48:20.399
And me.

01:48:21.599 --> 01:48:23.299
Crawling around the floor...

01:48:23.499 --> 01:48:25.499
...with my legs on fire.

01:48:28.898 --> 01:48:33.198
And all to steal a kid's silver dollar.

01:48:37.598 --> 01:48:38.997
Ridiculous!

01:48:40.397 --> 01:48:41.597
This is stupid!

01:48:50.097 --> 01:48:53.097
What are you sore about? We got no beef.

01:48:53.197 --> 01:48:54.997
It's us against them.

01:48:56.497 --> 01:48:58.197
This is between us.

01:48:59.197 --> 01:49:00.997
It's got nothing to do with them.

01:49:05.297 --> 01:49:07.797
Look at me, boy! Take a good look!

01:49:08.397 --> 01:49:11.497
I'm the last living thing
you're ever gonna see.

01:50:36.594 --> 01:50:38.994
Don't. Please, don't.

01:51:02.993 --> 01:51:04.593
It doesn't make sense.

01:51:06.193 --> 01:51:07.593
I mean what happened.

01:51:08.593 --> 01:51:09.593
Or why.

01:51:11.693 --> 01:51:14.093
It had nothing to do with the Clutters.

01:51:14.793 --> 01:51:17.993
They never hurt me,
they just happened to be there.

01:51:20.292 --> 01:51:22.892
I thought Mr. Clutter
was a very nice gentleman.

01:51:26.492 --> 01:51:29.392
I thought so right up until the time
I cut his throat.

01:52:38.590 --> 01:52:40.990
Mercy for them.

01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:43.290
The killers.

01:52:45.090 --> 01:52:48.290
How fortunate
that their admirable attorneys...

01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:53.190
...were not present at the Clutter home
that fateful evening.

01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:56.190
How fortunate for them
that they were not there...

01:52:56.290 --> 01:52:59.890
...to plead mercy for the doomed family...

01:53:00.690 --> 01:53:02.689
...because otherwise...

01:53:02.989 --> 01:53:05.289
...we would have found their corpses, too.

01:53:07.089 --> 01:53:09.589
If you allow them life imprisonment...

01:53:10.989 --> 01:53:14.289
...they will be eligible for parole
in seven years.

01:53:15.089 --> 01:53:17.789
That is the law.

01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:21.589
Gentlemen...

01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:24.189
...four of your neighbors...

01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:27.989
...were slaughtered like hogs in a pen...

01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:29.989
...by them.

01:53:32.489 --> 01:53:35.589
They did not strike in the heat of passion...

01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:37.589
...but for money.

01:53:38.689 --> 01:53:40.789
They did not kill in vengeance.

01:53:41.389 --> 01:53:43.589
They planned it for money.

01:53:44.689 --> 01:53:46.189
And how cheaply...

01:53:46.689 --> 01:53:48.688
...those lives were bought.

01:53:50.788 --> 01:53:51.988
$40.

01:53:53.488 --> 01:53:55.388
$10 a life.

01:53:56.988 --> 01:53:59.487
They drove 400 miles to come here...

01:54:00.687 --> 01:54:03.187
...they brought their weapons with them.

01:54:03.287 --> 01:54:06.987
This shotgun, this dagger.

01:54:07.187 --> 01:54:10.687
This is the rope
that they hogtied their victims with.

01:54:15.887 --> 01:54:18.187
This is the blood they spilled.

01:54:22.887 --> 01:54:24.487
Herb Clutter's.

01:54:26.687 --> 01:54:29.887
They who had no pity, now ask for yours.

01:54:30.787 --> 01:54:34.186
They who had no mercy,
now ask for yours.

01:54:35.086 --> 01:54:38.486
They who had no tears, now ask for yours.

01:54:39.086 --> 01:54:42.786
If you have tears to shed,
weep not for them...

01:54:44.086 --> 01:54:46.086
...weep for their victims.

01:54:46.886 --> 01:54:51.886
From the way the Holy Bible
was quoted here today...

01:54:52.286 --> 01:54:56.886
...you might think the word of God
was written only to protect the killers.

01:54:57.286 --> 01:54:59.786
But they didn't read you this:

01:55:00.986 --> 01:55:02.886
Exodus 20...

01:55:03.486 --> 01:55:05.886
...verse 13:

01:55:06.386 --> 01:55:08.986
"Thou shalt not kill."

01:55:10.486 --> 01:55:11.486
Or this...

01:55:12.186 --> 01:55:15.486
...Genesis 9, verse 12:

01:55:16.486 --> 01:55:19.484
"Who so shedeth man's blood...

01:55:20.184 --> 01:55:24.384
"...by man shall his blood be shed."

01:55:34.684 --> 01:55:37.484
<i>It took four hours to pick the jury.</i>

01:55:38.784 --> 01:55:41.684
<i>It took the state three days
to present its case.</i>

01:55:44.184 --> 01:55:46.784
<i>It took the defense one hour and a half.</i>

01:55:49.284 --> 01:55:51.184
<i>It took the jury...</i>

01:55:51.184 --> 01:55:53.684
<i>... 40 minutes to bring in the verdict.</i>

01:55:59.984 --> 01:56:01.784
<i>They had to be crazy.</i>

01:56:02.784 --> 01:56:06.483
<i>No. Maybe stupid, but perfectly sane.</i>

01:56:08.183 --> 01:56:10.183
<i>How can a perfectly sane man...</i>

01:56:11.583 --> 01:56:13.883
<i>... commit an absolutely crazy act?</i>

01:56:40.482 --> 01:56:43.082
<i>Calling all stations, Officer Linhard...</i>

01:56:43.382 --> 01:56:44.982
<i>... Officer Brackin.</i>

01:56:45.182 --> 01:56:47.382
<i>Please come to the desk sergeant"s office.</i>

01:56:47.882 --> 01:56:50.181
<i>Calling all stations, Officer C. Wright.</i>

01:56:51.981 --> 01:56:53.781
<i>Please call the desk sergeant.</i>

01:56:57.881 --> 01:57:00.881
- What happens now?
- They wait to die.

01:57:02.981 --> 01:57:06.081
I wonder how many others
are waiting in other prisons?

01:57:06.281 --> 01:57:07.681
About 200.

01:57:16.481 --> 01:57:19.781
<i>Perry and Dick began their waiting
in the "S and l" building...</i>

01:57:20.281 --> 01:57:22.781
<i>... Security and Isolation.</i>

01:57:25.481 --> 01:57:28.181
<i>The second floor is death row.</i>

01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:41.280
<i>Through the window
they can see the baseball field.</i>

01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:46.580
<i>Beyond the outfield, over the wall...</i>

01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:50.180
<i>... is an old warehouse with a tin roof.</i>

01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:55.880
This warehouse got a name?

01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:00.180
In this prison, it's called "The Corner."

01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:04.380
On hanging day, the men say,
"He's gone to 'The Corner'."

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.480
Perry and Dick have a date at "The Corner."

01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:13.580
One minute after midnight.
May, Friday 13.

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:23.479
<i>According to an expert
in forensic medicine...</i>

01:58:23.979 --> 01:58:26.279
<i>... neither one of them
would have done it alone.</i>

01:58:26.779 --> 01:58:29.679
<i>But together,
they made a third personality.</i>

01:58:30.479 --> 01:58:32.079
<i>That"s the one that did it.</i>

01:58:37.479 --> 01:58:38.879
Hey, Andy!

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:43.679
Does it tell anywhere in them books
what happens when you make the drop?

01:58:45.279 --> 01:58:47.079
Well, your neck breaks...

01:58:48.979 --> 01:58:51.079
...and you crap your pants.

01:58:52.779 --> 01:58:56.379
The trouble with you, Andy,
you got no respect for human life...

01:58:56.479 --> 01:58:58.279
...not even your own.

01:59:19.177 --> 01:59:23.477
<i>Doomsday, Friday 13, came and went...</i>

01:59:24.577 --> 01:59:26.577
<i>... but no one went to "The Corner."</i>

01:59:28.477 --> 01:59:31.077
<i>Perry and Dick appealed. Routine.</i>

01:59:32.977 --> 01:59:36.377
<i>They were granted a stay of execution.
Routine.</i>

01:59:37.577 --> 01:59:42.777
<i>The legal machinery in capital cases
usually runs a year or more. Routine.</i>

01:59:43.877 --> 01:59:46.477
<i>Death row has its own routine.</i>

01:59:48.677 --> 01:59:51.677
<i>Shower. One man at a time, once a week.</i>

01:59:52.676 --> 01:59:54.476
<i>Shave, twice a week.</i>

01:59:55.076 --> 01:59:57.576
<i>The guard locks the safety razor.</i>

01:59:58.476 --> 01:59:59.876
<i>Safety first.</i>

02:00:00.976 --> 02:00:04.876
<i>No radios, no movies, no TV.</i>

02:00:06.276 --> 02:00:08.976
<i>No cards, no games, no exercise.</i>

02:00:10.176 --> 02:00:13.276
<i>No mirrors, no bottles, no glasses.</i>

02:00:14.176 --> 02:00:15.976
<i>No knives, no forks.</i>

02:00:16.876 --> 02:00:18.676
<i>No suicide allowed.</i>

02:00:19.176 --> 02:00:21.076
<i>They could eat, sleep...</i>

02:00:21.676 --> 02:00:24.676
<i>... write, read, think, dream.</i>

02:00:25.276 --> 02:00:27.676
<i>They could pray, if so inclined.</i>

02:00:27.876 --> 02:00:30.576
<i>But mostly, they just waited.</i>

02:00:32.776 --> 02:00:36.676
The guy in the next cell, Andy.
He's been waiting two years.

02:00:37.376 --> 02:00:40.874
Newspapers call him
"The nicest boy in Kansas."

02:00:41.774 --> 02:00:44.274
One night he killed his sister.

02:00:45.274 --> 02:00:49.974
Then he shot his mother six times
and his father seventeen times.

02:00:51.474 --> 02:00:53.174
Andy's a nut, but I like him.

02:00:53.974 --> 02:00:56.774
Hey, Andy. Say hello to Mr. Jensen.

02:00:57.374 --> 02:00:59.374
He's writing the story of my life.

02:01:00.574 --> 02:01:01.674
Why?

02:01:03.874 --> 02:01:05.774
I told you he was a nut.

02:01:05.874 --> 02:01:08.974
Ronnie, Jim, meet Mr. Jensen.

02:01:10.774 --> 02:01:13.874
They knocked off seven. Strangers.

02:01:14.874 --> 02:01:17.474
Ronnie said they was better off dead.

02:01:20.474 --> 02:01:23.174
What about Perry? Don't you get along?

02:01:25.273 --> 02:01:27.973
Nobody can get along with him.

02:01:28.873 --> 02:01:31.673
There's five guys waiting here
for the big swing.

02:01:32.373 --> 02:01:36.273
Little Perry's the only one yapping
against capital punishment.

02:01:37.073 --> 02:01:39.273
Don't tell me you're for it?

02:01:40.073 --> 02:01:43.273
Hell, hanging's only getting revenge.

02:01:44.373 --> 02:01:46.473
What's wrong with revenge?

02:01:47.473 --> 02:01:49.973
I've been revenging myself all my life.

02:01:51.673 --> 02:01:54.773
Sure. I'm for hanging.

02:01:56.473 --> 02:01:59.372
Just so long as I'm not the one
being hanged.

02:02:01.972 --> 02:02:02.972
See you.

02:02:03.472 --> 02:02:05.472
Thanks for the magazines.

02:02:07.072 --> 02:02:09.871
Jim, you think that looks like Willie Jay?

02:02:10.471 --> 02:02:12.471
The way you see him, yes.

02:02:14.871 --> 02:02:18.671
That day at the bus station,
when I phoned you.

02:02:19.971 --> 02:02:23.871
If Willie Jay and I had connected,
none of this would of happened.

02:02:23.971 --> 02:02:28.371
- Maybe, if you hadn't come back to Kansas.
- Maybe!

02:02:28.871 --> 02:02:31.771
If they'd had a head-doctor here
during my first stretch...

02:02:31.771 --> 02:02:34.471
...he would've known
I had a bomb ticking inside of me.

02:02:34.571 --> 02:02:36.871
He would've known
I wasn't ready for parole.

02:02:36.971 --> 02:02:38.371
- You knew.
- Yeah.

02:02:38.471 --> 02:02:39.971
Why didn't you tell me?

02:02:42.471 --> 02:02:45.971
Then I wouldn't have gotten my parole,
would I, Reverend?

02:02:50.571 --> 02:02:53.771
<i>A few minutes after midnight,
in November...</i>

02:02:55.370 --> 02:02:57.670
<i>... one of them went to "The Corner."</i>

02:02:58.770 --> 02:03:03.570
<i>The others watched him cross the ball field
on his way to the gallows.</i>

02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:06.270
<i>It was Andy.</i>

02:03:06.970 --> 02:03:09.070
<i>"The nicest boy in Kansas."</i>

02:03:16.570 --> 02:03:18.670
<i>They heard the trapdoor go.</i>

02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:24.070
<i>The kept watching and waiting
for 19 minutes...</i>

02:03:24.570 --> 02:03:26.770
<i>... till Andy"s heart stopped beating.</i>

02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:30.270
<i>For Andy, the waiting was over.</i>

02:03:33.070 --> 02:03:35.470
<i>Perry and Dick waited five years.</i>

02:03:36.170 --> 02:03:40.070
<i>Three times their case went
to the United States Supreme Court.</i>

02:04:09.869 --> 02:04:12.769
My God! That harness!

02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:18.569
Richard, this is a warrant from
the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas.

02:04:19.169 --> 02:04:21.169
"Whereas, it was by this court ordered...

02:04:21.269 --> 02:04:25.669
"...that execution of the sentence of death
by hanging of Richard Eugene Hickock...

02:04:25.769 --> 02:04:28.568
"...imposed by the District Court
of Finney County, Kansas...

02:04:28.868 --> 02:04:32.368
"...be carried out on Wednesday,
April 14, 1965.

02:04:32.468 --> 02:04:35.268
"Commanding the warden
of the Kansas State Penitentiary...

02:04:35.368 --> 02:04:37.468
"...to carry the sentence into execution."

02:04:37.568 --> 02:04:39.067
Where's Smith?

02:04:41.067 --> 02:04:43.467
"Yea, let none that wait for thee
be ashamed.

02:04:43.567 --> 02:04:46.767
"Let them be ashamed
which transgress without cause.

02:04:47.067 --> 02:04:50.067
"Show me thy ways, O Lord,
teach me thy paths.

02:04:50.367 --> 02:04:53.267
"Lead me in thy truth, and teach me,
for thou art the God..."

02:04:58.967 --> 02:05:00.767
I gotta go to the toilet.

02:05:00.867 --> 02:05:04.267
We can't remove the harness.
There might not be time.

02:05:05.767 --> 02:05:06.967
Please.

02:05:07.067 --> 02:05:09.067
Try to control yourself.

02:05:10.167 --> 02:05:11.667
But that's it.

02:05:12.666 --> 02:05:16.466
When you hit the end of the rope
your muscles lose control.

02:05:22.566 --> 02:05:24.566
I'm afraid I'll mess myself.

02:05:24.566 --> 02:05:27.666
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
They all do it.

02:05:28.466 --> 02:05:30.466
For God's sake, man!

02:05:38.066 --> 02:05:42.266
"This is to command you, the warden
of the Kansas State Penitentiary...

02:05:42.366 --> 02:05:45.866
"...that on Wednesday, April 14, 1965...

02:05:46.266 --> 02:05:50.966
"...between the hours of 12:01 a.m.
And 2:00 a. M..."

02:05:51.966 --> 02:05:53.666
Is he the...

02:05:55.466 --> 02:05:57.866
How much does he get paid to hang them?

02:05:57.866 --> 02:05:59.964
$300 a man.

02:06:01.764 --> 02:06:03.364
Has he got a name?

02:06:04.264 --> 02:06:05.864
"We, the people."

02:06:07.464 --> 02:06:09.564
"...for the State of Kansas."

02:06:09.664 --> 02:06:11.664
Anything you want to say?

02:06:13.564 --> 02:06:17.764
Just that I hold no hard feelings.

02:06:19.664 --> 02:06:23.764
You're sending me to a better world
than this ever was.

02:06:28.964 --> 02:06:30.464
Nice to see you.

02:06:49.063 --> 02:06:51.563
Jim, Thoreau...

02:06:52.763 --> 02:06:54.663
...on man and nature.

02:06:54.863 --> 02:06:57.663
It's yours if you want it.

02:07:00.363 --> 02:07:01.663
Dick gone?

02:07:03.063 --> 02:07:05.163
Is his heart still beating?

02:07:09.663 --> 02:07:12.263
- What time is it?
- Take it easy, kid.

02:07:16.463 --> 02:07:19.162
Would you like me to write your father?

02:07:21.662 --> 02:07:24.362
I could send him one of your paintings.

02:07:24.462 --> 02:07:26.562
Or maybe your Bronze Star.

02:07:31.361 --> 02:07:33.361
Send him my treasure maps.

02:07:34.761 --> 02:07:36.761
Maybe now he'll get lucky.

02:07:39.361 --> 02:07:41.061
The Lone Wolf.

02:07:44.061 --> 02:07:48.861
You know, there was a time once
when we almost had it made.

02:07:50.161 --> 02:07:51.861
Just the two of us.

02:07:53.461 --> 02:07:58.161
He was in a fever about some new project
up in Alaska.

02:07:59.061 --> 02:08:01.161
A hunting lodge for tourists.

02:08:01.261 --> 02:08:05.561
It was gonna make us a fortune
better than a gold mine.

02:08:07.461 --> 02:08:11.361
But most of all, it was gonna be something
we never had before:

02:08:12.761 --> 02:08:14.261
A real home.

02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:17.160
We got it built, too.

02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:19.960
Just him and me, side by side.

02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:24.860
The day the roof was finished,
he danced all over it.

02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:28.960
I never was so happy in all my life.

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.860
It was a beautiful home.

02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:40.960
But no tourists ever came.

02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:43.960
Nobody.

02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:47.560
We just lived there...

02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:52.260
...all alone in that big, empty failure...

02:08:56.460 --> 02:08:59.160
...till he couldn't stand the sight of me.

02:09:02.759 --> 02:09:04.559
I think it happened...

02:09:06.859 --> 02:09:08.859
I was eating a biscuit.

02:09:10.259 --> 02:09:13.759
He started yelling what a greedy,
selfish bastard I was.

02:09:14.859 --> 02:09:17.159
Yelling and yelling till I grabbed his throat.

02:09:17.259 --> 02:09:19.159
I couldn't stop myself.

02:09:19.659 --> 02:09:21.759
He tore loose and got a gun.

02:09:23.459 --> 02:09:25.959
He said, "Look at me, boy!

02:09:27.759 --> 02:09:32.259
"Take a good look 'cause
I'm the last living thing you're gonna see."

02:09:36.159 --> 02:09:38.159
And he pulled the trigger.

02:09:41.059 --> 02:09:43.059
But the gun wasn't loaded.

02:09:45.159 --> 02:09:46.758
He began to cry.

02:09:49.658 --> 02:09:51.358
Bawled like a kid.

02:09:53.658 --> 02:09:55.258
I went for a long walk.

02:09:57.158 --> 02:09:59.357
When I got back, the place was dark.

02:10:00.457 --> 02:10:02.257
The door was locked.

02:10:03.657 --> 02:10:06.957
All my stuff was piled outside
in the snow...

02:10:07.457 --> 02:10:09.157
...where he threw it.

02:10:09.657 --> 02:10:12.657
I walked away and never looked back.

02:10:15.757 --> 02:10:19.157
I guess the only thing I'm gonna miss
in this world...

02:10:20.657 --> 02:10:22.557
...is that poor old man...

02:10:24.257 --> 02:10:27.157
...and his hopeless dreams.

02:10:31.357 --> 02:10:34.356
I'm glad you don't hate
your father anymore.

02:10:35.856 --> 02:10:37.156
But I do.

02:10:39.956 --> 02:10:41.256
I hate him.

02:10:43.956 --> 02:10:45.556
And I love him.

02:11:12.656 --> 02:11:14.756
- Coming?
- What for?

02:11:14.956 --> 02:11:17.056
What does it add up to, anyway?

02:11:17.556 --> 02:11:20.854
Well, four innocent
and two guilty people murdered.

02:11:20.854 --> 02:11:22.754
Three families broken.

02:11:23.254 --> 02:11:25.254
Newspapers have sold more papers.

02:11:25.254 --> 02:11:27.654
Politicians will make more speeches.

02:11:28.054 --> 02:11:30.954
Police and parole boards
will get more blame.

02:11:32.054 --> 02:11:33.754
More laws will be passed.

02:11:33.954 --> 02:11:36.354
Everybody will pass the buck.

02:11:36.754 --> 02:11:40.454
And then, next month, next year...

02:11:41.554 --> 02:11:43.554
...the same thing will happen again.

02:11:44.154 --> 02:11:46.754
Well, maybe this will help to stop it.

02:11:47.454 --> 02:11:48.754
Never has.

02:12:04.753 --> 02:12:09.553
This is a warrant from the Supreme Court
of the State of Kansas.

02:12:11.353 --> 02:12:15.453
"It was by the court ordered that execution
of the sentence of death by hanging...

02:12:15.553 --> 02:12:17.153
"...of Perry Edward Smith...

02:12:17.153 --> 02:12:20.153
"...imposed by the District Court
of Finney County, Kansas...

"...be carried out on Wednesday,
April 14, 1965."

02:12:27.253 --> 02:12:29.253
Anything you want to say?

02:12:36.853 --> 02:12:38.452
I think maybe...

02:12:41.452 --> 02:12:43.952
...I'd like to apologize.

02:12:46.052 --> 02:12:47.452
But who to?

02:13:10.151 --> 02:13:13.151
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want...

02:13:13.351 --> 02:13:16.151
"...he maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

02:13:16.351 --> 02:13:18.951
"He leadeth me beside the still waters...

02:13:19.051 --> 02:13:20.851
"...he restoreth my soul.

02:13:21.451 --> 02:13:25.151
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

02:13:25.751 --> 02:13:29.651
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

02:13:29.851 --> 02:13:31.851
"...I will fear no evil...

02:13:32.051 --> 02:13:33.751
"...for thou art with me...

02:13:33.851 --> 02:13:36.550
"...thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:41.050
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies...

02:13:41.150 --> 02:13:43.550
"...thou anointest my head with oil..."

02:13:44.250 --> 02:13:46.250
Is God in this place, too?

02:13:49.450 --> 02:13:51.250
"...my cup runneth over.

02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:56.650
"Surely goodness and mercy
will follow me all the days of my life...

02:13:57.550 --> 02:14:00.850
"...and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."
