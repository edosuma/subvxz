00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

(Frank) 'I've sounded out
loads of blokes on this.

01:19.580 --> 01:23.653
'99% of married men with families
have fantasized

01:23.740 --> 01:27.016
'about said wives and families
being killed.

01:27.100 --> 01:31.378
'Suddenly, instantly,

'Well, I would.'

01:59.780 --> 02:01.930
Mandy, can I take Katie to the park?

02:02.020 --> 02:03.578
Third time this week?

02:03.660 --> 02:05.093
Yeah, we have a laugh.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.852
In't that right, Katie?

02:06.940 --> 02:10.137
Be brill, going on swings and shit.

02:10.220 --> 02:12.131
Watch her. Park's a canine sewer.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.368
(Go down, that's it. All the way. Go down.)

02:16.460 --> 02:18.416
Why are you really
taking her to the park?

02:18.500 --> 02:19.694
Me and Katie are bezzies.

02:21.860 --> 02:23.452
- What colour's her hair?
- Get off, you dick.

02:23.540 --> 02:26.293
- You don't even know!
- Blonde. Blonde.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.369
The bab is a giant.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.451
They've got to induce.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.292
You can only gobble so much madras.

02:31.380 --> 02:32.699
Give them a bell.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.248
Can you do it? It sounds
better coming from a bloke.

02:35.340 --> 02:37.296
They pay more attention.

02:37.380 --> 02:39.655
STAMMERS

02:39.740 --> 02:42.208
...It's phones.
No, it's not me, babe.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.255
Oh!

02:43.340 --> 02:45.695
Oh...

02:45.780 --> 02:46.815
Don't give me the bug-eyed look.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.368
I'm coming to the fucking bullfight.
What more do you want?

02:49.460 --> 02:50.973
Don't piss her about.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.095
You know you'll go missing.

02:56.820 --> 02:58.890
Rubbish-point-crap

02:58.980 --> 03:02.495
The world stops on its axis at
Dad claiming he'll keep his word.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.536
You self-righteous little smart-arse.

03:04.620 --> 03:07.088
You're not too old to have your bollocks
kicked around your head, you know.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.329
Think you'll find I am.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.612
(Frank) Oh!

03:14.300 --> 03:16.018
- It's cold.
- I didn't know that.

03:17.460 --> 03:21.499
Sissy boy. Can't even
permanently fucking disfigure me.

03:23.780 --> 03:24.895
Yeah?

03:28.380 --> 03:32.134
Never call me "Dad" again.
You're the spawn of the devil.

03:32.220 --> 03:33.414
Why do you always bring that up?

03:33.500 --> 03:37.493
Because every day I'm reminded of it
by looking at your ugly fucking gob.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.572
Hey, if that's a lad, call it lan.

03:40.660 --> 03:43.458
I've always thought that's
a good name for one of mine.

03:45.380 --> 03:46.813
You're a fucking waste!

03:49.900 --> 03:53.210
Cheers for putting a word in, Mum.
I can call you that, can't I?

04:00.420 --> 04:03.093
Nearly there. Come on, boy.

04:03.180 --> 04:06.729
20 more pence, you can do it.
Mm! Lovely fags.

04:06.820 --> 04:08.538
There you go, Frank.

04:08.620 --> 04:10.656
52p for your coat. Bargain.

04:10.740 --> 04:14.938
Most jocular. Shouldn't you be out
working towards a safer community?

04:15.020 --> 04:17.579
Day off. I keep this on
to scare the shoplifters.

"Ooh! What were that?"

04:36.660 --> 04:38.491
Oh, yeah. Blitz spirit.

04:38.580 --> 04:41.652
People all together as one as
the Earth conspires against us

04:41.740 --> 04:43.617
by going on short spin cycle.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.579
Tsunami from that wouldn't knock
a digestive crumb off a cup of tea.

04:47.660 --> 04:50.049
Where is the almighty hand of God?

04:50.140 --> 04:53.212
Pointing at you, shouting "thief".

04:53.300 --> 04:54.289
What?

04:54.380 --> 04:57.577
- How do you know?
- He's been left on his own for five seconds.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.776
What else would he fucking do?

04:59.860 --> 05:01.179
(Yvonne) Waste.

05:01.260 --> 05:05.378
Well, that would appear to
be the received opinion.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.212
It is our duty to oppose it.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.455

05:36.620 --> 05:38.451
Is there anything I can do?

05:38.540 --> 05:39.814
Could you give us a foot massage?

05:39.900 --> 05:43.495
I meant a cup of tea or whatever.

05:43.580 --> 05:44.933
Christ's sake. Not for long.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.656
You've had all of us,
you're going to have another,

05:51.740 --> 05:52.695
and I feel like the fucking parent.

05:52.780 --> 05:57.729
How's that? It's going to be me
that makes it up with Dad, if we do.

05:57.820 --> 06:00.414
Who looks after me?

06:00.500 --> 06:02.491
Shouldn't it be you?

06:02.580 --> 06:04.138
We all make mistakes.

06:06.140 --> 06:08.131
I've done me best.

06:08.220 --> 06:09.414
Your best is shit.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.609
Get off!

06:21.380 --> 06:25.055
Sorry, Frank, you have to go outside.
Smoking ban.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.813
We lasted as long as we could
but the twats are on to us.

06:27.900 --> 06:31.256
The pub's been burnt down.
What harm can I do?

06:31.340 --> 06:32.932
Get us a big fine.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.454
Put us out of business.
We've been shot.

06:35.540 --> 06:36.939
You sell fucking Es.

06:37.020 --> 06:40.456
Nobody ever dies of
secondary tripping.

06:40.540 --> 06:42.258
I'm the only tosser here.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.858
No! I say no.
Someone's got to make a stand.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.330
Custer, Davy Crockett,
the kid with his dick in the dyke.

06:51.420 --> 06:53.695
Add Frank Gallagher to that list.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.578

Oh!

07:07.340 --> 07:08.614
Oh, my God, you've burst.

07:14.020 --> 07:15.453
Shit.

07:15.540 --> 07:18.373
The bastard will sue our tits off.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.294
Is it on its way?

07:21.380 --> 07:25.578
Well, a gallon of water breaking
out the fanny is a definite sign.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.615
Don't say "fanny".

07:26.700 --> 07:27.815
Debbie, forget the drill.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.572
Go and grab your dad
and tell him bab is imminent.

07:29.660 --> 07:32.413
I'll go. It's better if Debbie stays.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.411
- No, Debbie go.
- But...

07:34.500 --> 07:35.455
She's too young.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.373
That is my decision as a parent.

07:38.460 --> 07:40.416
See. I do make 'em.

07:42.540 --> 07:44.132
That's it. Great.

07:44.220 --> 07:45.972
Fuck.

07:46.060 --> 07:49.370
We were going to call. Your dad's
had a fall. Just a bit of a bump.

07:49.460 --> 07:50.813
How?

07:50.900 --> 07:52.731
Happened out here.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.050
Dad? Is he going to be all right?

07:55.140 --> 07:56.937
Let's just get him to hospital first.

08:06.860 --> 08:09.852
Keep hold, Katie. Katie, keep hold.

08:09.940 --> 08:13.057
All right, Carl? Hello, Katie.

08:13.140 --> 08:14.858

RUMBLING

08:18.740 --> 08:20.890
Fuckin' hell.

08:20.980 --> 08:24.529
Bindy.
I was hoping you'd be here.

08:24.620 --> 08:26.690
How's our pretty girl? Eh?

08:26.780 --> 08:29.817
You're well good
bringing her here all the time.

08:32.020 --> 08:32.975
Any news on her mum?

08:33.059 --> 08:36.177
No, she's still missing.

08:38.539 --> 08:40.974
Hello, darling.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.298
- Oi, I'm trying to watch this.
- I want to talk.

08:48.380 --> 08:50.496
Here we go. You're going to dump us.

08:50.580 --> 08:51.535
No, I'm not.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.850
< Why d'you say that?

08:54.940 --> 08:56.373
Do you not think we're solid then?

08:56.460 --> 09:01.170
Yeah, course I do. I... I just think
you're going to dump us sometimes.

09:02.980 --> 09:04.459
What do you want to talk about?

09:04.540 --> 09:06.417
Doesn't matter.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.013
Come on...

09:08.100 --> 09:09.931
Another brew.

09:15.900 --> 09:18.016
I know what you've done for
our Shane and I'm grateful.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.931
He's a different boy.
He needed to grow up.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.932
But when you do move on,
don't just disappear.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.976
Speak to him first.

09:25.060 --> 09:27.210
What?

09:27.300 --> 09:28.210
Why am I about to flit?

09:28.300 --> 09:32.134
Because we know you
better than you do.

09:35.340 --> 09:36.568
All right. In a bit.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.653
- You all right?
- I've gotta go.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.617
It's my dad.
He's on the way to hospital.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.019
Shit, Katie.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.419
I'll look after her.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.455
If you want,
I'll give you my address.

09:52.340 --> 09:54.058
Yeah... OK.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.053
- There you go.
- Cheers, Bindy.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.334
You saved my life.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.498
Come on, Katie.

10:11.340 --> 10:13.934
30 minutes from entry desk to bed.
Only beaten our own record!

10:14.020 --> 10:16.056
What's wrong with him?

10:16.140 --> 10:17.175
He's in a coma.

10:17.260 --> 10:18.454
How long for?

10:18.540 --> 10:21.100
Coma is as coma does.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.818
An hour. Years.

10:23.940 --> 10:25.498
Probably not years.

10:25.580 --> 10:28.538
Give him a few hours,
we'll dob him through X-ray.

10:28.620 --> 10:29.848
Are you really a doctor?

10:29.940 --> 10:31.009
Course, why?

10:31.100 --> 10:32.658
They're either foreign or posh.

10:32.740 --> 10:34.890
I am posh. "Awesome".

10:36.780 --> 10:39.294
My mum's gone into labour.
Shall we tell her about him?

10:39.380 --> 10:41.655
Never give bad news to a woman
in the throes. I learned that from my ex.

10:41.740 --> 10:43.890
Eh!

10:44.900 --> 10:45.776
Suit yourself.

10:45.860 --> 10:46.895
How is he?

10:46.980 --> 10:50.017
Still unconscious.
There must be stuff we can do.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.897
Coma crap. Talk to him.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.574
Surround him with objects that he likes.

10:54.660 --> 10:57.049
You never know-know
until you give it a go-go.

10:59.060 --> 11:00.015
Dr Dickhead.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.660
- Do you need me here?
- Why?

11:02.740 --> 11:03.855
I panicked. I left Katie
in the park with a girl.

11:03.940 --> 11:05.009
What? Who?

11:05.100 --> 11:06.010
Bindy.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.490
You stupid cock. Go and get her.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.409
- Hiya.
- Doctor says not to tell Mum.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.455
Why not?

11:22.540 --> 11:24.815
Because she'll go mental.
Are you coming?

11:24.900 --> 11:26.299
I can't. She's gonna drop.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.699
I'm staying here till he wakes up.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.210
Put the phone to his ear, close.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.489
All right, Dad. I mean Frank.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.411
What do I say? Wake up?

11:38.620 --> 11:41.976
I could say that any day of the week,
won't make no difference then either.

11:42.740 --> 11:45.379
We don't get on.
I'm not what you want in a son.

11:45.460 --> 11:47.416
I'm not your son

11:47.500 --> 11:49.855
and you're not my dad.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.500
Oh, Mum's in labour.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.292
If it's yours.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.940
Have they found him yet?

11:58.020 --> 11:59.294
No.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.331
Shit. Nurse!

12:19.260 --> 12:20.534
Look, see. There.

12:21.580 --> 12:25.493
That's nothing, my dear. He'll be
back with us before you know it.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.333
...Bindy. About so high.

12:29.420 --> 12:31.650
Quite fit. About medium to large...

12:31.740 --> 12:33.298
Proper round tits
with just a hint of nip.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.893
What does her face look like?

12:34.980 --> 12:37.130
She's...

12:38.260 --> 12:40.012
(Muffled speech)

12:40.100 --> 12:42.660
Sort of average looking.

12:42.740 --> 12:45.174
Don't know.
Sorry, mate. Ain't got a clue.

12:45.260 --> 12:48.013
Her tits are fucking fantastic.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.772
Someone's got to remember them.

12:49.860 --> 12:51.339
Come on, lads!

12:55.300 --> 12:57.530
- What are they?
- They said bring him stuff he likes.

12:57.740 --> 12:59.139
- I can't think of anything else.
- Where did you get 'em?

12:59.220 --> 13:00.699
Gabby on reception.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.974
What do we do?

13:05.780 --> 13:06.769
Wait.

13:08.780 --> 13:09.974
Harder!

13:10.060 --> 13:11.573
My thumbs are murder.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.538
There'll be murder if you stop.
Can you ring Debbie again?

13:14.620 --> 13:17.293
What's the point?
He's not going to come.

13:17.380 --> 13:21.259
He lets everyone down.
Accept that. Give birth.

13:21.340 --> 13:23.615
No. He said he'd be here
and he will be here.

13:26.820 --> 13:28.617
Do you think I'm still the youngest?

13:30.860 --> 13:34.011
Mum's had loads of kids. She could
probably drop another in her sleep.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.258
He needs us here. I'm staying.

13:38.340 --> 13:42.299
So am I then. Why do girls
wear make-up and perfume?

13:43.780 --> 13:45.498
Because they're ugly and they smell.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.611
- Do you want some?
- Um...

13:49.700 --> 13:51.372
He's bleeding again.

13:51.460 --> 13:54.452
He's going to have all sorts
of involuntary actions.

13:54.540 --> 13:56.337
Smiling and that.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.217
We're just to ignore
him unless his eyes open.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.699
What do we talk to him about?

14:01.300 --> 14:04.098
Tell him stuff about the family.
What you talk about normally.

14:04.180 --> 14:06.569
I never talk to him normally.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.139
All right. Here's your chance.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.854
Dad, every night when he thinks
I'm sleeping, Carl has a wank.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.293
Is that normal?

14:15.380 --> 14:16.699
Oh, he's going to wake up now.

14:20.620 --> 14:21.575
Oh!

14:21.660 --> 14:23.412
Midwife should be here by now.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.172
Maybe she got held up or something.

14:30.740 --> 14:32.253
How long will it be?

14:32.340 --> 14:34.058
How should I know?

14:34.140 --> 14:35.778
Don't we time the contractions?

14:35.860 --> 14:38.579
If you know so much about it,
why don't you deliver it?

14:38.660 --> 14:42.255
Let's go somewhere with white coats
and machinery that beeps.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.535
It's not like you're going
to get turned on, is it?

14:44.620 --> 14:45.689
You're my mum.

14:45.780 --> 14:47.418
Yeah, I'm a woman.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.259
I've known you were
that way since you were six.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.058
You know I'm gay?

14:52.140 --> 14:53.129
That's what I said.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.369
You didn't say that.
Why didn't you mention it?

14:54.460 --> 14:56.291
It's none of my business.

14:56.380 --> 15:00.851
Anyway, you didn't feel
the need to share, so why should I?

15:00.940 --> 15:05.616
It's starting again.
Can you rub my back for me?

15:05.700 --> 15:07.019
- Katie and Carl back?
- No.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.251
Has he called?
He's not answering his mobi.

15:10.340 --> 15:13.696
I don't know where he is.
We're pretty busy here, Mandy.

15:24.660 --> 15:26.218
Is he a nurse or doctor?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.939
Nurse, they're just chatting.

15:29.020 --> 15:32.217
If he was a doctor
they'd be crawling up his arse.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.375
I'd never be a male nurse.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.894
Why not? It's not gay.

15:38.980 --> 15:43.610
I know it isn't but you spend
all day shaving men's pubes off.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.099
Who told you that?

15:45.180 --> 15:47.296
Gabby on reception.

15:48.820 --> 15:52.051
I can't find her.
The address Bindy gave is a wreck.

15:52.140 --> 15:54.893
No-one lives there.
What am I going to do?

15:54.980 --> 15:57.175
I've bloody lost Katie.
Mandy's going to wazz off the scale.

15:57.260 --> 16:00.570
(Shut up!) Right, this girl.
What do you know about her?

16:00.660 --> 16:01.172
Nothing.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.579
Her name. Bindy.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.252
What does she look like?

16:05.340 --> 16:06.978
She's sort of...

16:07.060 --> 16:08.254
(Muffled) Any news on her mum?

16:09.820 --> 16:12.380
I'm rubbish at descriptions.
She's just normal.

16:12.460 --> 16:13.973
She stole a kid.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.288
It could be a mistake.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.052
She gave you a false address.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.937
Do you think she'll hurt her?

16:19.020 --> 16:20.658
Don't think so.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.696
She seems to really love kids.

16:22.780 --> 16:23.690
In a good way.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.819
I'll ring Tom. But you're
going to have to tell Mandy.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.015
She'll kill me.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.091
Yeah, you deserve it.

16:33.140 --> 16:34.095
Yeah...

16:34.180 --> 16:36.091
I'll wipe it off.

16:45.060 --> 16:46.539
Where is she?

16:47.700 --> 16:49.133
What does she look like?

16:53.340 --> 16:54.534
(Muffled) Any news on her mum?

16:56.020 --> 16:58.375
Pink top. She's got a pink top.

16:58.460 --> 17:01.736
Every girl in 10 miles is
wearing a fucking pink top.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.412
What if she's changed her clothes?

17:03.500 --> 17:04.773
Let's do him.

17:04.859 --> 17:05.974
I'm the only one
that will recognise her.

17:06.060 --> 17:07.492
You don't know fuck.

17:07.579 --> 17:08.217
I will if I see her.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.415
If Katie's been hurt, I'll kill him.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.330
I don't think she'd hurt her.
She really liked her.

17:12.420 --> 17:14.411
That's the reason I took
her in the first place.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.172
You used our Katie as bait!

17:16.260 --> 17:17.897
Maguire?

17:21.020 --> 17:23.932
- OK. We'll take over. Police matter.
- We didn't call you. It's a Maguire matter.

17:24.020 --> 17:27.092
We'll drive him around.
See if we can find her. Come on.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.410
Come with us, Carl.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.297
What are we doing?
Fucking get out looking!

17:31.380 --> 17:34.531
Move! Split up.
Call everybody you know. Go!

17:37.020 --> 17:39.090
Come here, love.

17:41.860 --> 17:42.895
Snap! That was mine.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.538
Cheat!

17:44.620 --> 17:47.339
RAPID BEEPING
Mine did.

17:47.420 --> 17:48.853
- Shit.
- What?

17:50.740 --> 17:52.298
- What?
- That noise.

17:52.380 --> 17:53.415
CONTINUOUS BEEP

17:53.500 --> 17:54.455
What?

17:54.540 --> 17:56.292
It just stopped his heart.

18:00.060 --> 18:01.334
We've killed him.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.529
Nurse!

18:05.300 --> 18:06.255
Nurse!

18:10.100 --> 18:12.091
Come on. Don't do this to me. Clear!

18:12.180 --> 18:14.489
Come on. Talk to me. Talk to me.
Come on. Clear!

18:18.340 --> 18:21.218
Sorry, love.
Give you a scare?

18:21.300 --> 18:22.415
No harm done.

18:23.780 --> 18:25.179
Always falling off.

18:25.260 --> 18:27.012
BEEPING REGULATES

18:28.820 --> 18:30.890
- What were you doing with them?
- Nothing.

18:34.260 --> 18:35.329
Can you smell burning?

18:35.420 --> 18:37.297
No.

18:40.660 --> 18:43.458
- (Tom) Is that her there?
- (Carl) I don't know!

18:43.540 --> 18:47.658
You've got to do better than this, Carl.
Please. She's got Katie.

18:47.740 --> 18:51.449
- I've got like a mental block.
- You're not helping yourself here.

18:51.540 --> 18:54.100
Fuck off, you.
I still think you're a paedo.

18:54.180 --> 18:57.775
Carl! You ever heard
the phrase police brutality?

18:59.620 --> 19:01.372
Is this normal?

19:01.460 --> 19:04.418
As far as I can remember.
I've blotted most of it out.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.252
I'm not surprised.

19:06.340 --> 19:08.058
Horror show.

19:08.860 --> 19:09.690
Ooh.

19:11.340 --> 19:13.695
How did you know?
I barely knew myself.

19:13.780 --> 19:18.456
There was something
different about you.

19:18.540 --> 19:21.054
You weren't like Lip,
all bustle and breakages. You were...

19:21.140 --> 19:23.335
Don't say sensitive.

19:23.420 --> 19:26.253
No, not just that.

19:26.340 --> 19:28.456
I <i>am</i> your mother.

19:28.540 --> 19:32.692
I did think about you and how you'd be.

19:32.780 --> 19:33.929
I did!

19:34.020 --> 19:36.580
I'm surprised you haven't moved on.

19:36.660 --> 19:38.298
I might never live in a family again.

19:39.900 --> 19:40.935
Oh...

19:41.020 --> 19:43.739
Ooh, here comes another one.

19:43.820 --> 19:46.459
They must have sent
another midwife by now.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.496
Here you are, mate.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.572
Can't find 'em.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.696
No one's coming. We're on our own.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.498
Please, let's go to the hospital.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.298
No, not till Frank gets here.

20:00.380 --> 20:02.940
I want to do it proper this time.

20:03.020 --> 20:04.533
I want <i>both</i> parents there.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.850
I want a real start for the baby.

20:15.220 --> 20:17.973
- Is that an involuntary reaction?
- Probably claim that.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.494
Is it gone?

20:25.580 --> 20:26.535
You look, you're the oldest.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.770
You're going to be a bloke.
You look.

20:28.860 --> 20:29.656
Safe.

20:33.660 --> 20:34.888
Not around this aftie.

20:34.980 --> 20:36.811
- Eh?
- Things to do.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.891
Are you all right, love?
Do you need a friendly ear?

20:39.700 --> 20:42.134
Nose out, Lillian.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.734
- Are you helping?
- What?

20:50.820 --> 20:52.776
- Looking for Katie.
- Who?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.452
Our Mandy's baby.

20:54.540 --> 20:55.939
Mandy's got a baby?

20:56.020 --> 20:58.978
Yes. You've seen her loads of times.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.413
What's happened?

21:00.500 --> 21:02.297
Some girl's gone off with her.

21:02.380 --> 21:03.859
Fuck. That's fucking well sick.

21:03.940 --> 21:07.137
What you doing anyway?
I thought you was on a double shift.

21:07.220 --> 21:10.895
GP check-up. I go all the time,
sparing you the full facts.

21:10.980 --> 21:13.175
I've got to go. See you in a bit.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.494
Want a glass of water?

21:19.580 --> 21:20.933
And that's it, gone?

21:21.020 --> 21:25.093
You can come back for a
check-up afterwards if you want.

21:25.180 --> 21:27.136
You always this helpful?

21:27.220 --> 21:30.292
Or are you specially keen to
make sure <i>I don't drop one?</i>

21:30.380 --> 21:32.371
We treat everyone the same.

21:32.460 --> 21:33.449
It's your decision.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.091
How long can this go on for?

21:42.180 --> 21:43.499
Oh, fucking days.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.895
Days? Piss off.

21:46.980 --> 21:48.493
I'm knackered.
It must be ready to come out.

21:48.580 --> 21:50.969
Yeah, it is.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.176
- I'm holding it in.
- What?

21:53.260 --> 21:56.252
I meant it. It's not
coming out till Frank's here.

21:58.340 --> 22:00.854
He's in a coma in hospital.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.974
Well, why didn't you fucking tell me?

22:05.060 --> 22:06.413
The doctor said not to.

22:06.940 --> 22:09.090
Oh, get me fucking bag.

22:13.660 --> 22:16.128
I spy with my...

22:16.220 --> 22:17.972
We're not that desperate.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.732
Coming through!
SHE PANTS

22:19.820 --> 22:20.809
What is it?

22:20.900 --> 22:23.494
I had to tell her.
She wouldn't give birth till she got here.

22:23.580 --> 22:25.218
- I can't watch.
- Me neither.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.210
It's down to me again.

22:26.300 --> 22:29.975
- Get a nurse!
- Do you think you could wake up for the birth?

22:30.060 --> 22:31.539
(lan) Look at the useless asshole.
He's out for the fucking count.

22:31.620 --> 22:33.417
(Monica) Don't talk about your dad like that!

22:33.500 --> 22:35.058
(lan, echoing) He's not my dad...

22:44.220 --> 22:47.815
You're awake.
About fucking time, mate.

22:49.140 --> 22:51.017
Brekkeroo.

22:52.140 --> 22:53.368
What's with the City boy stripes?

22:53.460 --> 22:57.089
Fucking belting opportunity, mate.
Luck's in, Daddio.

22:57.180 --> 22:59.216
With your son by your side
we're going to rock the world.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.018
Room at the trough for
all the little pigs.

23:03.100 --> 23:04.931
We need a chat once
you finish malingering.

23:08.860 --> 23:11.010
Five minutes R&R, then we teleport.

23:11.900 --> 23:14.130
Ready for your injection, nurse?

23:15.220 --> 23:16.892
...You're doing great.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.049
The baby's coming!

23:18.140 --> 23:19.573
Push.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.455
Now then, now then. How's about?

23:25.540 --> 23:28.577
How's about concentrating
on the main event? Me.

23:29.420 --> 23:30.933
Later.

23:32.900 --> 23:35.414
You're like a dog
with two fucking dicks.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.378
Do you know what you're looking at
apart from a fucking handsome devil?

23:38.460 --> 23:40.371
Shock me to my bones.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.736
Behold Svengali.
The showbiz entrepreneur.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.288
I sniff out the small acts,
promote them in clubs.

23:46.380 --> 23:49.213
Screw the girls, take all the money,
flog 'em on.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.972
Fucking licence to print, mate.
I'm wedged.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.015
Flower, Dad?

23:52.100 --> 23:54.489
Oh, thanks, Lola lovely.

23:54.580 --> 23:55.410
Fighting fit?

23:55.500 --> 23:58.776
Back to the best of myself, Lo.
The very best.

23:58.860 --> 24:02.136
That's the fucking spirit, our Dad.

24:02.220 --> 24:04.097
Can you do that any harder? Jesus.

24:04.180 --> 24:06.375
I'm straight off me deathbed here.

24:08.060 --> 24:09.288
Daddy's home.

24:09.380 --> 24:10.369
THEY WHOOP

24:12.260 --> 24:13.409
What's with the blankets?

24:13.500 --> 24:17.129
I'm sorry, Frank.
I've gone all insidey-outsidey again.

24:17.220 --> 24:19.939
Jesus Christ, Sheila-Monica.

24:20.020 --> 24:22.011
I told you.
You've got to stop it, babe.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.614
I've run out of special pills.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.895
She's cooked for you. I've tried it.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.652
A bloody gorgeous pie. Mm!
SHE FARTS

24:28.740 --> 24:30.378
Melty mega.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.337
I've done your
ironing for you, love.

24:32.420 --> 24:36.174
It's a tonic to see
all my girls lined up.

24:36.260 --> 24:37.534
Got any socks need mending?

24:37.620 --> 24:38.609
I could wash your hair.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.612
Give the man some space.
He's been in a coma.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.213
If that's not the fucking definition

24:43.300 --> 24:45.973
of deserving a pint,
I don't know what is.

24:46.060 --> 24:47.175
Can I come?

24:47.260 --> 24:49.615
Sorry, mate. You've still only got one arm.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.531
It's all that wanking. I warned you.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.451
It's worth an arm.

24:53.540 --> 24:54.734
Awww!

24:56.380 --> 24:58.814
Bye! >

24:59.900 --> 25:01.618
Bye, Dad. Love you.

25:06.020 --> 25:07.692
LOUD BELCH

25:07.780 --> 25:09.259
Filled an 'ole.

25:10.820 --> 25:12.412
Scratched an itch.

25:17.060 --> 25:18.095
It's your fucking round.

25:18.180 --> 25:19.613
You're the best.

25:19.700 --> 25:20.894
Apart from your dad, of course.

25:20.980 --> 25:22.459
Thanks for that, Karen.

25:22.540 --> 25:24.098
It's always nice to be remembered.

25:27.460 --> 25:28.575
So what do you say?

25:30.260 --> 25:32.171
- What?
- To me being your manager.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.375
Managing what?

25:33.460 --> 25:35.815
- You really don't know?
- What?

25:35.900 --> 25:39.495
You're a talented guy.
With my help sky's the fucking minimum.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.810
Infinity's the limit. Pads!

25:41.900 --> 25:42.935
WHISTLES

25:44.460 --> 25:47.770
Who is the funniest guy
you've ever seen or met?

25:47.860 --> 25:52.980
I've seen Les Dawson, Tarby,
Fat Bernard, creepy Doddy, the lot.

25:53.060 --> 25:55.779
Funniest man I've ever met, Frank.

25:55.860 --> 25:57.054
Me?

25:57.140 --> 26:00.530
Without a doubt.
Frank Gallagher. You crack me up.

26:00.620 --> 26:02.212
Cheers, Pads. On your way.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.289
I'm funny?

26:03.380 --> 26:05.575
All you need to do is get on
stage and rant like a bastard.

26:05.660 --> 26:09.255
Try it out here.
Talent night tonight.

26:13.180 --> 26:17.810
Thank you, Chatsworth.
You've been a lovely audience!

26:17.900 --> 26:19.299
CHEERING AND WHISTLING

26:26.260 --> 26:27.739
Do you believe me now?

26:27.820 --> 26:32.132
I do! I do! That was the moment
I've been waiting for.

26:32.220 --> 26:36.179
I am finally... born.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.694
That's what it feels like,
like I've been born.

26:38.780 --> 26:41.613
Perspective, mate.
Don't blow it out your arse just yet.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.055
It's only The Jockey.

26:44.140 --> 26:45.812
Do we have a deal?

26:49.460 --> 26:54.295
We do.
I'm going to be a fucking star.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.689
Finally, recognition.

26:57.260 --> 26:58.534
Yeah!

27:01.820 --> 27:03.651
It's all down to you, Son.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.730
Keep pushing, Mum.
I can see its head.

27:08.820 --> 27:11.493
(Midwife) Keep pushing, you're doing well.

27:11.580 --> 27:14.253
- It's coming!
- One last push, Mum.

27:14.340 --> 27:16.410
You've gone stellar, haven't you?
Can't get away from you on the box.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.856
They're making a documentary
about you, aren't they?

27:19.940 --> 27:24.331
Thought he were clever but he were
nowt but a thieving, pikey twat.

27:24.420 --> 27:27.537
But smoked his own weight every week,
so what can you do, eh?

27:27.620 --> 27:34.412
Despite the booze, fags, drugs,
he does have surprisingly sweet breath.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.934
(Gruff male voice) For years
he's pretended I'm a man in drag.

27:37.020 --> 27:40.456
Bloody gay, I reckon.
Calls me Bob Selecta.

27:40.540 --> 27:42.610
Still, better than Phil Selecta.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.616
(Man) 'Day 88 in the house.'

27:46.700 --> 27:50.090
Elton's having a difficult
one though. A bit down.

27:50.180 --> 27:51.852
(Big Brother) 'Do you think that could
have anything to do with the fact

27:51.940 --> 27:53.851
'you called him a fat, bald gaylord? '

27:58.180 --> 28:01.138
(TV presenter) 'Let's see how Franky
fares in his tough fucker trial.'

28:03.540 --> 28:04.859
(Muffled) Get me out of here now!

28:11.540 --> 28:14.930
(Man) 'Doesn't his paso doble stand out? '

28:19.860 --> 28:22.499
This is where history began.
Talent night here.

28:24.100 --> 28:28.537
Pissed it. Acting all shit-faced.

28:28.620 --> 28:31.532
The irony is I don't drink that much.
You know, it's an act.

28:31.620 --> 28:34.532
You know, a persona.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.611
(Man) You've been very generous in
attributing a large portion of

28:36.700 --> 28:38.133
your success to your son, lan.

28:38.220 --> 28:39.175
Mm.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.330
I believe you signed half
your earnings over to him.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.615
Sorry, can't talk about that.

28:43.700 --> 28:46.931
Oh, all right. Let's cut there.

28:47.020 --> 28:48.931
Big news, Daddio.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.011
What? Another triumph.
I get bored of them.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.931
Too fuckety-fuck it is.

28:53.020 --> 28:55.898
Adam Sandler's dropped out of
some shit film and they want you.

28:55.980 --> 28:57.652
Hollywood?

28:57.740 --> 28:59.253
Exactamundo.

28:59.340 --> 29:00.898
Globalisation.

29:00.980 --> 29:03.619
Everything we've ever hated is ours.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.895
You're fucking
Starbucks and McDonald's

29:05.980 --> 29:08.938
wrapped in a stream of pissed bollocks.

29:09.020 --> 29:11.818
I'm a franchise?

29:11.900 --> 29:13.856
A Frankise!

29:15.060 --> 29:20.339
Me and a line of sons reaching
round the world. My loins.

29:20.420 --> 29:23.139
Success!

29:23.220 --> 29:25.609
God, I got a good 'un when I got you.

29:28.780 --> 29:30.816
What's that?
I've rescued a little baby puppy.

29:30.900 --> 29:31.935
What the fuck for?

29:32.020 --> 29:33.658
Well, for us.

29:33.740 --> 29:37.096
We can't take it to America
because he's scared of flying too.

29:37.180 --> 29:39.774
(Monica, echoing) Please, I need you.

29:39.860 --> 29:43.455
- Monica needs you.
- Choose the real thing.

29:43.540 --> 29:46.577
Hold him Frank, it's real.
Choose the real thing.

29:46.660 --> 29:50.050
It isn't a choice. You signed this.

29:51.940 --> 29:53.578
I'm everything you wished for.

29:55.660 --> 29:56.854
That's a copy.

29:57.780 --> 29:58.735
What?

29:58.820 --> 30:00.048
You owe me money, Frank. Gotta pay.

30:03.700 --> 30:05.770
(Monica, echoing) I need you!

30:10.100 --> 30:12.216
I did say I was a handsome devil.

30:13.540 --> 30:17.294
But... But I'm your father. I made you.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.690
Not strictly true.

30:20.780 --> 30:24.295
No blood, as you never fucking
tire of reminding me.

30:24.380 --> 30:27.929
Choose us, Frank.
Take the puppy. Take it.

30:28.020 --> 30:29.738
Don't touch the puppy, Frank!

30:30.780 --> 30:32.577
Don't touch it.
Don't touch the puppy.

30:32.660 --> 30:33.729
Don't touch the puppy.

30:34.980 --> 30:36.379
Arghhh!

30:37.580 --> 30:39.013
He's awake.

30:42.540 --> 30:43.734
What's this?

30:49.740 --> 30:51.253
Where's its tail?

30:53.420 --> 30:55.251
It hasn't got a tail,
it's a little girl.

30:55.340 --> 30:57.171
Another one?

31:01.660 --> 31:02.979
You all right?

31:05.700 --> 31:07.133
I'm glad you were there.

31:10.060 --> 31:11.334
Did I faint?

31:12.740 --> 31:13.695
It weren't too bad.

31:13.780 --> 31:17.011
She's lying.
It were fucking horrible.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.453
She did really well.

31:19.540 --> 31:22.657
lan was here for me.

31:22.740 --> 31:25.334
Will you say hello to
your little sis, lan?

31:41.100 --> 31:44.217
Two hours. Two hours.
What if they've not found her.

31:44.300 --> 31:45.892
Stop. Look at what we know.

31:47.620 --> 31:49.531
It's a woman,
that's got to be good news.

31:49.620 --> 31:51.850
She likes Katie.

31:51.940 --> 31:54.738
She met her a few times.
Carl trusted her.

31:55.580 --> 32:00.370
Even he's not stupid enough to leave
her with a proper fucking headcase.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.575
You let him take her out.

32:01.660 --> 32:03.730
So it's my fault?

32:03.820 --> 32:06.459
No.

32:06.540 --> 32:11.819
You left Katie with him,
so he can't be that untrustworthy.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.333
She will be found.

32:25.900 --> 32:26.969
You got a light, love?

32:27.060 --> 32:28.379
Yes, somewhere.

32:31.460 --> 32:32.529
Here you go.

32:38.100 --> 32:40.819
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.049
How old is she?

32:43.140 --> 32:44.653
Uh, three.

32:44.740 --> 32:46.492
What's your name, sweetie?

32:46.580 --> 32:48.696
She's called Gemma.

32:50.020 --> 32:51.578
I don't really like
people smoking round her.

32:51.660 --> 32:55.369
Yeah.
Apparently it's bad for you.

33:03.860 --> 33:06.135
Katie?

33:08.660 --> 33:10.730
She's massive.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.572
She looks about three months old.

33:12.660 --> 33:15.333
Can you go and get your mam, Debbie?

33:15.420 --> 33:16.933
I was going to get off.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.772
Can't Liam do it?

33:18.860 --> 33:20.088
Leaving your old dad?

33:20.180 --> 33:22.057
I'm seeing Tom.

33:22.140 --> 33:23.573
I'll get her.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.292
What are you going to call her?

33:29.380 --> 33:30.733
Stella.

33:32.660 --> 33:33.854
Good name.

33:33.940 --> 33:35.419
Pretty.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.860
Why don't you call her
Tenants Purple or Thunderbird?

33:38.940 --> 33:40.134
Fuck's sake, Dad.

33:40.220 --> 33:41.050
Not the beer.

33:41.140 --> 33:43.654
Jesus, I'm not that fucking deranged.

33:43.740 --> 33:46.254
Stella for "star".

33:47.700 --> 33:49.133
Our lickle star.

33:58.980 --> 34:01.699
- What's that for?
- Thanks for looking after your mam.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.372
It's appreciated.

34:07.060 --> 34:08.094
You're a good son.

34:12.340 --> 34:14.012
Sometimes I look at you and Mum

34:14.100 --> 34:17.409
and I can see
how you very nearly work.

34:17.500 --> 34:20.094
Bugger me. I fucking can't...

34:26.179 --> 34:30.253
Have you stopped?
You can't even fucking look after her.

34:30.340 --> 34:32.251
Look at the state. She's filthy.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.856
I just thought I could be a mum to her.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.214
Hers has run off.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.370
She hasn't run off.
She's desperate.

34:40.940 --> 34:42.896
She really looks
like my little sister.

34:42.980 --> 34:47.656
Don't tell me. She died in
a terrible fucking accident.

34:47.739 --> 34:49.172
We had a fire.

34:50.460 --> 34:51.529
(Fuck.)

34:55.420 --> 34:57.888
Is that true
or are you just some fucking nut?

34:57.980 --> 35:00.892
Of course it's true.
It's my sister.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.058
I didn't know what to do.

35:05.660 --> 35:07.537
At the time I wasn't thinking. I just...

35:07.620 --> 35:11.374
wrote our old address down
without thinking.

35:11.460 --> 35:13.610
And then...

35:13.700 --> 35:14.894
I'm sorry.

35:18.900 --> 35:20.492
I don't want you to drop your load,

35:20.580 --> 35:24.493
but her family are well fucking creative
when it comes to revenge.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.013
Get help.

35:26.100 --> 35:27.977
And get it a long way from here.

35:28.060 --> 35:29.015
I will.

35:33.060 --> 35:34.812
Quite nice really, isn't she?

35:36.420 --> 35:39.332
The girl didn't mean any harm.
I don't think.

35:40.980 --> 35:43.130
- Katie!
- (Mimi) Is she all right?

35:43.220 --> 35:44.255
She's lovely.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.773
Did you see the girl, Bindy?

35:45.860 --> 35:47.179
Yes.

35:47.260 --> 35:48.773
Can you give us a description?

35:48.860 --> 35:50.259
I can give you better than that.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.529
Got a photie.

35:53.460 --> 35:55.132
Go on, take a look.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.494
That her?

35:57.780 --> 35:59.133
You haven't got one with
more of her in, have you?

35:59.220 --> 36:00.209
Like what?

36:02.260 --> 36:04.694
More upper body.

36:07.460 --> 36:08.688
Fuck it. That's her, deffo.

36:13.580 --> 36:16.970
- Thank God.
- And Kelly.

36:17.060 --> 36:18.413
Some terrible things have
been said about this girl.

36:18.500 --> 36:19.728
Yeah, mainly by you.

36:19.820 --> 36:21.572
Shut up, dickless.

36:21.660 --> 36:24.891
And I'm sorry
but that's behind us now.

36:24.980 --> 36:28.131
This house will always be grateful
and always have a welcome for you.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.780
Ta. Ta.

36:30.860 --> 36:32.657
So what do we do with Carl?

36:32.740 --> 36:34.617
Don't do anything to him.

36:34.700 --> 36:37.089
We've got her back now
and that's all that matters.

36:37.180 --> 36:41.093
No, I meant what do we do with him?
Do we leave him there?

36:41.180 --> 36:42.977
I'm going to be sick!

36:45.660 --> 36:47.173
You can't fucking just leave me here!

36:49.740 --> 36:51.059
Help!

36:57.020 --> 36:58.419
How were check-up?

36:58.500 --> 37:00.809
- What?
- You went to t'doctors.

37:02.060 --> 37:04.255
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.
- Bollocks.

37:05.460 --> 37:07.655
What are you lying for?

37:07.740 --> 37:09.219
Tell me.

37:13.340 --> 37:14.693
I was arranging an abortion.

37:16.180 --> 37:17.579
You can do it with a pill now.

37:17.660 --> 37:18.854
Is it mine?

37:18.940 --> 37:20.771
You're the only man I've been careless with.

37:20.860 --> 37:23.010
I haven't had any accidents
with anyone else.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.977
- Is it mine?
- Yes, it's fucking yours.

37:28.940 --> 37:30.259
Did you take it?

37:33.100 --> 37:34.135
No, not yet.

37:35.580 --> 37:39.493
Good. Fucking hell, Kelly.
We've got a tradition, a family tradition.

37:39.580 --> 37:42.253
Maguires, you knock a girl up

37:42.340 --> 37:45.093
and you stick by her, no matter what.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.169
What?

37:49.620 --> 37:52.180
Kelly... You're a...

37:54.060 --> 37:58.372
...A wave washed over my whole life

37:58.460 --> 38:00.690
and made it worth something.

38:02.740 --> 38:04.412
You know...

38:04.500 --> 38:06.377
- Shane?
- Shut up.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.411
I'd do anything for you.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.250
I worship you.

38:13.420 --> 38:15.251
I love you.

38:15.940 --> 38:18.852
I want us to have this baby.

38:23.900 --> 38:27.370
Oh, that's better! Full house. I was beginning
to think it was empty round here.

38:27.460 --> 38:29.018
Has it done anything yet?

38:29.100 --> 38:31.330
Yeah, she's give us
a tip on a horse

38:31.420 --> 38:33.888
and invited us round to the pub
to wet her head.

38:33.980 --> 38:38.576
Yeah? Joke. You don't realise
but your dad is a funny guy.

38:38.660 --> 38:39.775
Yeah, right.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.418
Come on, then. Gather round.

38:44.460 --> 38:46.132
And say hello...

38:46.220 --> 38:48.176
to Stella

38:48.260 --> 38:50.137
lana Gallagher.

38:50.220 --> 38:52.017
lana?

38:54.500 --> 38:55.535
Oh!

38:58.140 --> 38:59.368
- Who wants to hold her?
- Me.

38:59.460 --> 39:00.495
OK.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.730
Good girl.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.089
Where are you off?

39:08.180 --> 39:10.410
Get changed. Can't go to
the pub like this, can I?

39:10.500 --> 39:12.058
I'll get my jacket.

39:12.140 --> 39:14.859
You're dumping her on us already?
Come back!

39:23.100 --> 39:24.294
LAUGHTER

39:27.900 --> 39:29.049
Mum, Dad.

39:30.220 --> 39:32.176
I'm up the chuff.

39:32.260 --> 39:34.251
CHEERING

39:35.420 --> 39:37.695
That'll be the making of you.

39:37.780 --> 39:39.338
- I'm delighted.
- Thank you.

39:40.860 --> 39:42.498
Did you hear that? Pregnant.

39:42.580 --> 39:43.535
That's how you do it.

39:44.820 --> 39:46.890
I'll be proud to be the
grandfather of your child.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.699
- What about the prossie stuff?
- What prossie stuff?

39:49.780 --> 39:51.771
And the drugs.
Shit.

39:51.860 --> 39:54.215
What drugs?

39:54.300 --> 39:57.451
Is there a Maguire tradition
if you knock a girl up?

39:57.540 --> 39:59.212
There is.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.530
Never give your real name.

40:12.060 --> 40:14.779
You fucking romantic bastard.

40:14.860 --> 40:17.010
Drinks. A celebration!

40:17.100 --> 40:19.056
Hey, we have had another little one.

40:19.140 --> 40:22.098
Is there anything you
wouldn't use to get a free drink?

40:22.180 --> 40:23.772
I have had a bang on the head.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.497
- Drinks are on the house tonight, Frank.
- First round.

40:27.580 --> 40:28.933
That'll do.

40:29.020 --> 40:30.089
Sorry.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.738
Watch where you're fucking going.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.414
I'm Kelly fucking Maguire, nearly.

40:38.220 --> 40:40.688
(Frank) Good evening, Chatsworth.

40:40.780 --> 40:45.934
As some of you may already know
we have become a father again.

40:46.020 --> 40:47.931
Thank you, thank you.

40:48.020 --> 40:52.571
Little Stella is over there
with the rest of my wonderful family.

40:52.660 --> 40:56.539
Liam and Debbie and Carl and lan.

41:00.180 --> 41:04.219
And my wife Monica.
I could not be prouder...

41:04.300 --> 41:07.337
and I would like to take this opportunity

41:07.420 --> 41:10.651
of giving you my impersonation
of Stephen Hawking in the bath.

41:10.740 --> 41:12.378
GROANS

41:12.460 --> 41:15.497
For the universe is complete...

41:16.180 --> 41:17.579
Shut up.

41:17.660 --> 41:19.013
RUMBLING

41:20.540 --> 41:22.053
Fucking hell.

41:22.140 --> 41:24.449
Don't mock that man.
He's a fucking hero. Off.

41:26.060 --> 41:27.413
Bollocks.

41:27.500 --> 41:28.819
Party.
