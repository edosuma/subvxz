WEBVTT

00:03.965 --> 00:05.213
My name is Calder Michaels,

00:05.266 --> 00:07.167
and I'm the station chief
here in Medellin.

00:07.168 --> 00:09.590
So you're like the sheriff
this here town?

00:09.591 --> 00:11.829
What were you doing
trying to access my accounts?

00:11.830 --> 00:12.881
You're the Puma?

00:12.882 --> 00:13.933
My friends call me Teo.

00:14.331 --> 00:15.581
Arthur,
I know Teo is your son.

00:16.361 --> 00:17.494
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:17.561 --> 00:19.863
I have engaged
in an extramarital affair.

00:19.914 --> 00:24.251
I am resigning my post,
effective immediately.

00:24.335 --> 00:25.869
I'm here for you.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.088
Is that invitation for dinner
still open tonight?

00:28.172 --> 00:30.624
I want to search
Seth Newman's house.

00:45.857 --> 00:47.724
I need you to go
back down to Colombia

00:47.775 --> 00:49.309
as soon as possible.

00:49.394 --> 00:53.030
The ALC is planning an attack
on American interests.

00:53.097 --> 00:54.314
Teo Braga is behind it.

00:54.399 --> 00:56.617
Are you asking me
to kill him?

01:02.724 --> 01:05.559
I need absolute honesty,
Arthur.

01:05.643 --> 01:06.844
I know I'm not your boss
anymore, Annie,

01:06.895 --> 01:08.345
but that doesn't mean
you can make demands.

01:08.396 --> 01:11.231
I'm trying to help you, and
there are a lot of gaps to fill.

01:11.316 --> 01:14.818
Have you told Joan
about Teo?

01:14.886 --> 01:16.236
Yes.

01:16.321 --> 01:17.321
Are the two of you
on speaking terms?

01:17.388 --> 01:19.356
That's personal.

01:19.407 --> 01:20.441
Well, I need to know
if you can

01:20.525 --> 01:22.192
work together
on actionable intel.

01:22.243 --> 01:24.611
Is there something to act on?

01:24.696 --> 01:28.282
Were you followed?
Of course not.

01:29.734 --> 01:30.834
Annie.

01:30.902 --> 01:33.837
What's going on?

01:33.905 --> 01:36.373
Joan, thank you for coming.

01:36.424 --> 01:38.759
I needed to speak
to you both together.

01:38.843 --> 01:40.961
You said it was
time-sensitive.

01:41.045 --> 01:42.796
I just received this
from Henry Wilcox.

01:42.881 --> 01:45.682
It's intel that suggests Teo
may be involved in a bomb threat

01:45.750 --> 01:47.851
against an American target
in Colombia.

01:47.919 --> 01:48.936
A total lie.

01:49.020 --> 01:50.270
I'll get this
to South America desk,

01:50.355 --> 01:52.639
loop in the CTC and out
to the stations right away.

01:52.724 --> 01:54.024
Wait, you're moving on this?

01:54.091 --> 01:56.026
It's a bomb threat,
Arthur.

01:56.093 --> 01:57.394
No, it's my son.

01:57.445 --> 01:59.446
If Teo's done
nothing wrong,

01:59.531 --> 02:01.031
he has no reason
to fear the hunt.

02:01.098 --> 02:02.649
Unless the hunt
blows his cover.

02:02.734 --> 02:04.201
What cover?

02:04.268 --> 02:06.737
First you tell her about
your son before you tell me,

02:06.788 --> 02:08.322
then you fail
to tell her everything

02:08.406 --> 02:11.775
when she actually
needs to hear it.

02:11.826 --> 02:13.210
There's
a possibility that Teo

02:13.277 --> 02:14.495
really is involved
in the bomb plot,

02:14.579 --> 02:16.997
but it doesn't mean
he's a terrorist.

02:17.081 --> 02:19.082
He's an undercover operative
inside ALC.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.785
That's what
the payments were for.

02:21.836 --> 02:23.921
Why didn't you just tell me?

02:23.972 --> 02:25.773
I had a responsibility
to protect his mission.

02:25.790 --> 02:27.758
I told you before
that Teo's mom died.

02:27.809 --> 02:30.177
It was an ALC bomb.

02:30.261 --> 02:31.979
As Teo grew older, he--

02:32.063 --> 02:35.065
he became obsessed
with the idea of revenge.

02:35.132 --> 02:36.892
And the only way he could
get next to the man

02:36.901 --> 02:38.435
was to join ALC himself.

02:38.486 --> 02:39.820
It was a bold
and dangerous move,

02:39.904 --> 02:40.821
one I begged him
not to make,

02:40.905 --> 02:43.440
but, well, he was adamant.

02:43.491 --> 02:45.909
We trained him off book.

02:45.977 --> 02:49.997
Teo learned quickly.
He became a double inside ALC,

02:50.081 --> 02:52.148
all while pursuing
the man who killed his mother.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.203
Two years ago
he finally found him.

02:56.287 --> 02:59.873
ALC viewed the killing
as a power move.

02:59.958 --> 03:03.927
Teo eliminating
one of his rivals.

03:03.995 --> 03:06.346
He earned respect.

03:06.431 --> 03:08.215
But he started
missing dead drops,

03:08.299 --> 03:10.300
he'd fall out of touch
for weeks at a time,

03:10.351 --> 03:11.468
and now he's...

03:11.519 --> 03:14.721
Well, he's virtually
off the radar.

03:14.806 --> 03:16.356
You think he's gone rogue?

03:16.441 --> 03:18.008
No, I think
he's working his cover.

03:18.059 --> 03:19.843
That assumes
he hasn't turned.

03:19.894 --> 03:21.374
He wouldn't be
the first deep cover Op

03:21.396 --> 03:22.529
to lose his moral compass.

03:22.614 --> 03:24.698
He cut off
all contact with you.

03:24.782 --> 03:26.862
Or it could mean he needs help
and he can't reach me.

03:26.868 --> 03:29.536
That's a father talking,
not a handler.

03:29.621 --> 03:32.906
I believe in him.

03:32.991 --> 03:34.408
He's still
working his mission,

03:34.492 --> 03:36.577
and he'll protect his cover
at whatever cost.

03:36.661 --> 03:38.962
He still knows true north.
So what's the plan?

03:39.030 --> 03:40.047
We treat him
like an operative

03:40.131 --> 03:41.548
who wants to come in
from the cold?

03:41.633 --> 03:44.051
Yes. I'll give you
the exfiltration protocols.

03:44.135 --> 03:46.753
Make contact, get him
to a safe facility in Panama.

03:46.838 --> 03:47.971
I'll meet you there.

03:48.039 --> 03:49.840
You still have access
to a safe facility?

03:49.891 --> 03:52.342
You do.
I can get a plane ticket.

03:52.393 --> 03:56.013
Joan?

03:56.064 --> 03:59.900
We'll still actively pursue
any leads on a bomb threat.

03:59.984 --> 04:01.735
I can keep this part
of the mission separate

04:01.819 --> 04:04.071
from the larger investigation
for two days.

04:04.155 --> 04:05.105
That's all you get.

04:05.189 --> 04:06.440
Thank you.

04:06.524 --> 04:08.224
Don't thank me.
Thank Annie.

04:08.276 --> 04:10.444
Thank you, Annie.

04:10.528 --> 04:13.947
I'll see you in Panama.

04:18.235 --> 04:19.670
Did you talk to Joan
about Seth?

04:19.737 --> 04:20.671
It didn't come up.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.839
Which is another
way of saying

04:22.907 --> 04:25.842
I couldn't bring myself
to talk about it.

04:25.910 --> 04:27.094
I can talk with her.

04:27.178 --> 04:29.546
Thanks.

04:29.597 --> 04:31.932
I'm sorry. I know that won't
be a fun conversation.

04:32.016 --> 04:34.434
It's okay.

04:34.519 --> 04:39.439
Is that what's
bothering you?

04:39.524 --> 04:41.975
I think Arthur's
asking you for too much.

04:42.060 --> 04:43.694
It was my idea.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.112
It was your idea to share
the intel with them.

04:45.196 --> 04:47.030
The rest is
Arthur calling in a favor.

04:47.098 --> 04:48.982
It's not a favor.

04:49.067 --> 04:51.101
It's my job to help
a fellow operative.

04:51.152 --> 04:54.287
I don't see Teo
as a fellow anything.

04:54.372 --> 04:56.490
I don't like him,

04:56.574 --> 04:58.208
and I don't think Arthur's
capable of seeing him clearly.

04:58.275 --> 05:02.245
Well, that's what
this assessment is for.

05:02.296 --> 05:03.547
I know.

05:03.614 --> 05:07.584
But you can still take this.

05:07.635 --> 05:10.470
It masks which cell towers
you bounce off

05:10.555 --> 05:13.724
so it is totally
untraceable and secure.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.343
It's my new prototype.
You're the only one who has it.

05:16.427 --> 05:19.179
I love it.

05:19.263 --> 05:21.131
Hey, while you're
in the mood to give gifts...

05:21.182 --> 05:23.600
You just packed my favorite
T-shirt, didn't you?

05:23.651 --> 05:26.236
I was hoping you'd think
it was in the wash.

05:26.303 --> 05:29.106
- And then I felt bad.

05:29.157 --> 05:30.107
It's okay.

05:30.158 --> 05:32.025
You can take it...

05:32.110 --> 05:35.946
on one condition.

05:35.997 --> 05:38.365
Promise you'll bring it back.

05:38.449 --> 05:40.250
I promise.

05:43.119 --> 05:46.119

for www.addic7ed.com

06:49.887 --> 06:51.905
Hmm?

06:56.060 --> 06:58.328
Mm, hmm.

08:00.424 --> 08:01.675
As head of the DPD,

08:01.759 --> 08:03.126
you are responsible

08:03.177 --> 08:05.312
for monitoring threats
on American soil.

08:05.396 --> 08:08.899
Is that correct?
It is.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.066
We all reviewed
the intelligence

08:10.134 --> 08:11.467
surrounding
Jai Wilcox's death.

08:11.519 --> 08:14.654
We also read a closed file
about an unnamed operative

08:14.739 --> 08:19.159
who was shot in her house
here in Washington.

08:19.243 --> 08:23.530
Those events were both
terrible tragedies.

08:23.614 --> 08:26.700
They haunt me.

08:26.784 --> 08:28.484
And they motivate me
to be smarter

08:28.536 --> 08:31.037
in preventing future ones.

08:31.122 --> 08:33.590
That's very noble.

08:33.657 --> 08:38.345
And it makes sense that you'd
only want us to look forward.

08:38.429 --> 08:40.380
I'm not sure I understand.

08:40.464 --> 08:42.933
Well, a look at your past
is very troubling.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.719
Forgive me, Senator, but--

08:45.803 --> 08:48.054
Your path
at the agency is one

08:48.139 --> 08:49.890
that Arthur Campbell
cleared for you

08:49.974 --> 08:51.892
so you tell me
why you think you'd even

08:51.976 --> 08:55.011
be sitting here today if it
weren't for your husband.

08:55.062 --> 08:58.448
I've built
my own department.

08:58.515 --> 09:01.201
Cultivated
my own operatives.

09:01.285 --> 09:03.870
All of my successes
at the Agency

09:03.955 --> 09:05.789
have been entirely my own.

09:05.856 --> 09:08.458
So you stand
behind your choices.

09:08.525 --> 09:10.026
I do.

09:10.077 --> 09:11.494
Your judgment is strong.

09:11.545 --> 09:13.914
It is.

09:13.998 --> 09:15.131
And yet you didn't know

09:15.199 --> 09:18.752
that your husband
was having an affair.

09:18.836 --> 09:20.036
No.

09:20.087 --> 09:22.973
So you tell us,
would you trust a spy

09:23.040 --> 09:26.092
to identify threats
against the nation

09:26.177 --> 09:29.813
when she can't identify threats
against her own marriage?

09:36.070 --> 09:38.521
- Eric.
- Hi, Joan.

09:38.572 --> 09:40.273
What brings you
to the hill?

09:40.358 --> 09:43.660
My my Q and A with the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

09:43.727 --> 09:46.413
You're up
for the DCS job too.

09:46.497 --> 09:47.664
Yeah.

09:47.731 --> 09:49.366
This won't be awkward,
will it?

09:49.417 --> 09:51.084
No. Good luck.

09:51.168 --> 09:52.702
Thanks.

09:52.753 --> 09:55.038
Oh, how'd it go in there?

09:55.089 --> 09:56.673
It went well.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.485
Good.

10:03.047 --> 10:04.431
Auggie.

10:04.515 --> 10:06.582
We okay to talk?

10:06.634 --> 10:08.134
Yeah. I'm good.

10:08.219 --> 10:11.604
I'm sorry, Joan, but this
isn't gonna be easy to hear.

10:11.689 --> 10:14.590
Well, rip off
the band-aid, Auggie,

10:14.642 --> 10:17.694
my armor is strong
these days.

10:17.761 --> 10:21.364
Henry has moles
inside Langley.

10:21.432 --> 10:23.817
Yeah, I know.
I saw the file he gave Annie.

10:23.901 --> 10:28.822
And Annie just discovered that
Seth Newman was one of them.

10:28.906 --> 10:30.490
How?

10:30.574 --> 10:33.209
She overheard Seth
conspiring with Henry.

10:33.277 --> 10:37.380
What do you mean "was"?
"Seth was one of them"?

10:37.448 --> 10:40.300
He attacked Annie
two days ago.

10:40.384 --> 10:43.169
She had to act
in self-defense.

10:43.254 --> 10:47.257
I'm sorry, Joan.

10:47.308 --> 10:49.476
Where's the body?

10:49.560 --> 10:51.261
We don't know.

10:51.312 --> 10:52.929
Somewhere in the Potomac.

10:52.980 --> 10:57.567
Where did the attack happen?

10:57.634 --> 10:59.903
It started at Seth's place.

10:59.970 --> 11:02.238
And did Annie go back
and wipe the scene?

11:02.306 --> 11:03.490
There wasn't time.

11:03.574 --> 11:05.742
But don't worry,
I'm gonna figure something out.

11:05.809 --> 11:09.029
Well, who's gonna do it?
Annie can't. You can't.

11:09.113 --> 11:12.415
We can't trust any CIA cleaner
who might be in bed with Henry.

11:12.483 --> 11:13.917
I mean, it has to be me.

11:13.984 --> 11:17.670
- No, Joan--
- I know his place.

11:17.755 --> 11:19.539
I've been there.

11:19.623 --> 11:22.258
- It's a huge risk.
- There's no other way.

11:22.326 --> 11:24.544
End of discussion.

12:09.724 --> 12:10.858
What are you doing?

12:10.988 --> 12:12.572
I'm returning
your dead drop to you.

12:12.656 --> 12:14.574
It's an Agency-vetted
exit package.

12:14.658 --> 12:16.125
Just leave me alone.

12:16.193 --> 12:19.162
Teo, there's intel
linking you to a bomb plot.

12:19.213 --> 12:21.173
Arthur thinks if we could
just talk for a minute--

12:21.198 --> 12:23.365
- Not now.
- Why not?

12:23.417 --> 12:24.717
Teo, just give me a minute.

12:24.802 --> 12:28.087
Go home.

12:28.172 --> 12:32.642
Wha?

12:32.709 --> 12:34.143
Teo.

12:38.882 --> 12:39.816
Annie.

12:39.883 --> 12:41.317
Well, that didn't go well.

12:41.384 --> 12:42.652
You didn't get
the GPS thread on him.

12:42.719 --> 12:43.853
No, I did,

12:43.904 --> 12:45.154
but my version
of the meeting going well

12:45.222 --> 12:47.273
was not needing
to geolocate him.

12:47.357 --> 12:49.442
What was your read?

12:49.526 --> 12:50.827
He's locked
in damage control.

12:50.894 --> 12:52.174
He sees anything new
as a threat,

12:52.229 --> 12:53.496
even when it's a lifeline.

12:53.563 --> 12:55.748
So you think
he still can be saved?

12:55.833 --> 12:57.450
Auggie, I know
how you feel about him,

12:57.534 --> 12:58.951
but he has all the markings
of an operative

12:59.036 --> 13:00.419
that doesn't
know how to come home.

13:00.504 --> 13:04.423
I will happily be wrong if it
means Henry's intel is too,

13:04.508 --> 13:06.008
but how you gonna get him
to leave with you

13:06.076 --> 13:07.510
if he won't even
speak to you?

13:07.577 --> 13:10.463
His cover
is an ALC terrorist, right?

13:10.547 --> 13:12.932
So we treat him like one.

13:13.016 --> 13:14.350
If you're saying
what I think you're saying...

13:14.417 --> 13:15.635
I won't go in alone.

13:15.719 --> 13:17.436
To be discussed further.

13:17.521 --> 13:19.972
I'll text you as soon
as he lands somewhere.

13:20.057 --> 13:21.557
Thank you.

13:29.066 --> 13:32.034
Hi, I have patch code

13:32.102 --> 13:35.037
45-9-633.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.456
Can you connect me
to Yellowstone?

15:59.800 --> 16:00.966
Hey, I got your text.

16:01.051 --> 16:02.584
Has Teo moved?

16:02.636 --> 16:04.437
Nope, he's still
at the coordinates I sent

16:04.521 --> 16:06.939
so I ran the location through
a couple of satellites.

16:07.024 --> 16:09.358
Is the terrain
urban or jungle?

16:09.426 --> 16:10.810
Way outta town.

16:10.894 --> 16:12.695
Can you tell me the people
that are inside with him?

16:12.762 --> 16:15.398
Yeah, we got a couple of hits
on some heat signatures.

16:15.449 --> 16:19.118
My best guess would be
about a dozen other bodies.

16:19.202 --> 16:22.238
Well, that's less
than I thought.

16:22.289 --> 16:24.623
Annie, you don't
have to go in there.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.042
You are well
within your rights

16:26.109 --> 16:28.077
to tell Arthur
it's not worth the risk.

16:28.128 --> 16:30.046
Auggie,
like I said before,

16:30.113 --> 16:32.331
I'm going in with
the best team around.

16:32.416 --> 16:33.666
Who?

16:35.969 --> 16:37.470
The sheriff.

16:37.554 --> 16:40.389
Annie?

16:40.457 --> 16:41.424
I'll call you back.

16:41.475 --> 16:42.475
Why does no one
like to give me

16:42.559 --> 16:43.559
the heads up
when you're in town?

16:43.626 --> 16:46.929
I'm giving you
the heads up personally.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.431
I came right away.

16:50.934 --> 16:53.519
You've been here
for 12 hours.

16:53.603 --> 16:56.405
Is that your idea
of "right away"?

16:56.473 --> 16:59.358
I came here to help you.

16:59.443 --> 17:01.810
I've got
an ALC attack to stop,

17:01.862 --> 17:03.946
and Langley decides to send
the one officer whose ass

17:03.997 --> 17:06.281
I had to save the last time
she was down here.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.000
What if that officer
also knows

17:08.085 --> 17:10.002
the location
of an ALC stronghold?

17:10.087 --> 17:13.372
Bullshit.
I'm calling bullshit.

17:13.457 --> 17:17.126
I'm serious.

17:17.176 --> 17:19.295
I'll give you the credit
for the win.

17:19.346 --> 17:22.381
You can capture the intel
and the personnel.

17:22.465 --> 17:26.218
All I want is Teo Braga.

17:26.303 --> 17:28.837
How could you have
possibly found something

17:28.889 --> 17:30.973
that my nation-wide network
of assets hasn't?

17:31.024 --> 17:32.975
I planted a silver ion
thread on him

17:33.026 --> 17:36.145
that directs to a block 3
satellite every four seconds.

17:36.196 --> 17:38.180
How did you get close enough
to plant a thread?

17:38.231 --> 17:39.982
It's not relevant.

17:40.033 --> 17:43.068
Teo Braga
is a known terrorist

17:43.153 --> 17:45.788
who is implicated
in a bomb threat,

17:45.855 --> 17:47.856
so if you got within one foot
of him, yeah, that's relevant.

17:47.908 --> 17:51.460
Do you want the location
to the stronghold or not?

17:51.528 --> 17:52.828
You know I do.

17:52.879 --> 17:55.047
You run the raid,
I get Teo.

17:55.132 --> 17:57.049
We have a deal?

18:01.704 --> 18:03.756
Sure. What the hell.

18:18.699 --> 18:20.965
Annie's about to walk
into an ALC stronghold.

18:20.966 --> 18:22.017
Are you aware of that?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.969
Come on in.
Keep your voice down.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.941
You told me
I couldn't read her in,

18:29.993 --> 18:31.994
but the second
your son is involved,

18:32.078 --> 18:34.279
you turn right around
and tell her yourself.

18:34.330 --> 18:37.115
What exactly
are you objecting to?

18:37.166 --> 18:38.533
That you weren't the one
delivering the brief?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.752
You compromised
my operative's trust in me.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.621
Oh, Annie understands
the meaning of "need to know."

18:42.672 --> 18:43.922
I am her handler, Arthur.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.458
Trust between us
is paramount.

18:46.509 --> 18:48.927
You are her boyfriend, and
trust between you is paramount.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.013
Yes, I am,
and, yes, it is.

18:51.097 --> 18:54.683
Annie is taking huge risks
to repair your shortcomings.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.885
I make no apologies
for having objections to that.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.553
Annie is a highly-trained
operative

18:58.638 --> 19:00.188
with a good metric
for risk/reward

19:00.273 --> 19:03.892
and an inability to walk away
from actionable intelligence.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.444
No, she couldn't
walk away from you.

19:05.511 --> 19:09.114
You preyed on
her sense of loyalty.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.565
If you want to yell at me

19:10.650 --> 19:14.486
because you can't be totally
open with your girlfriend, fine.

19:14.537 --> 19:16.488
It has nothing to do
with the mission.

19:16.539 --> 19:17.956
Forgive me
if I don't want

19:18.023 --> 19:20.042
to take relationship advice
from you right now, Arthur.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.827
Oh, I am exactly the one
you should be taking it from.

19:21.878 --> 19:26.048
If you can't live with secrets,
you shouldn't be dating a spy.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.383
I'll take that
under advisement.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.202
Don't ask me to keep things
from her again.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.088
I won't do it.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.148
Done one of
these things before?

19:43.215 --> 19:45.267
I've been in
a tough spot before,

19:45.351 --> 19:48.219
but I'm not gonna insult you by
saying this is the same thing.

19:48.271 --> 19:51.156
Surprise is your friend,
and maybe your only friend.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.691
But that goes away
in 20 seconds.

19:52.742 --> 19:53.692
So whatever you have to do,

19:53.743 --> 19:55.527
you have to do--
in 20 seconds.

19:55.578 --> 19:58.830
Yeah, and what are we doing?

19:58.898 --> 20:00.449
I thought we were
going to an ALC stronghold

20:00.533 --> 20:01.867
to get Teo Braga.

20:01.918 --> 20:04.536
There's that word again.
"Get."

20:04.587 --> 20:05.921
It's a tricky word,
isn't it?

20:06.005 --> 20:07.089
How so?

20:07.173 --> 20:08.757
I studied German
growing up on the base.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.343
And their words
are very specific,

20:11.410 --> 20:13.462
and I hear you're
good with languages.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.514
'Cause you know the power
of the right word.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.849
You wanna "get" Teo Braga,
meaning

20:17.917 --> 20:20.102
interrogate him,
lock him up,

20:20.186 --> 20:22.971
or put a bullet
in his head?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.389
Would it be
a horrible spy cliche

20:24.440 --> 20:26.691
if I said my interest in him
is classified?

20:26.759 --> 20:29.811
Yes.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.532
Well, I want him
captured alive.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.734
Alive is
the toughest option.

20:35.785 --> 20:38.120
Well, that's why
I came to you.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.565
You're the only CIA man
in Colombia

20:39.605 --> 20:42.124
with the resources and
the expertise to pull it off.

20:44.794 --> 20:46.444
That's your specialty,
isn't it?

20:46.496 --> 20:48.964
Identify someone's weakness
and then you twist.

20:49.048 --> 20:53.001
You twist a wire.
You turn an asset.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.888
To the asset
it feels the same.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.307
Sometimes you can
turn a man to your side,

20:59.392 --> 21:02.010
but sometimes you have
to recognize that he is lost

21:02.094 --> 21:04.763
and that choice, that decision,
is the real work we do.

21:04.814 --> 21:08.517
Lots of people
can smile sweetly

21:08.601 --> 21:10.152
and seduce someone
with what they want to hear.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.237
But is your judgment
solid enough

21:12.304 --> 21:14.606
to recognize whether you should
even waste the words?

21:14.657 --> 21:17.659
Calder,
we're on the same team.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.077
We want the same thing.

21:19.144 --> 21:23.165
I said I'd help you get Teo,
whatever that means.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.783
And I will.

21:24.834 --> 21:26.952
The rest remains to be seen.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.888
Six.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.814
Remember. 20 seconds.

21:55.865 --> 21:57.949
Stay behind me.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.817
<i>Compadres!</i>

23:21.367 --> 23:23.952
Raw materials.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.410
Stay down!
Stay down!

23:40.452 --> 23:42.837
We got him!

23:45.558 --> 23:46.925
No!

23:53.566 --> 23:55.567
That's not him.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.357
Calder!

24:02.441 --> 24:05.777
Don't! Don't!

24:13.252 --> 24:15.837
This one's ours now.

24:37.919 --> 24:41.299
You had 200 pounds
of cemtex, Mr. Braga.

24:42.745 --> 24:44.944
That's enough to level
a ten-story building.

24:46.162 --> 24:49.126
Tell us which building.

24:49.127 --> 24:51.295
What was your target?

24:52.302 --> 24:54.917
Okay.

24:54.918 --> 24:57.670
Your silence is a choice.

24:57.754 --> 25:01.207
And it's an aggressive one.

25:05.762 --> 25:08.180
I'll be honest.

25:08.265 --> 25:12.435
I wanted you to die
in that jungle.

25:12.502 --> 25:14.804
And even though that's true,

25:14.855 --> 25:18.607
I'm still the guy

25:18.675 --> 25:21.444
that you should talk to.

25:29.619 --> 25:30.736
Come on.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.539
No? Oh, there you go.
Yeah. Yeah.

25:33.623 --> 25:36.208
Yeah. Yeah.

25:48.004 --> 25:50.389
What was your target?

25:50.474 --> 25:53.392
Hey.

25:53.477 --> 25:57.396
Give me a minute
to talk to him.

26:01.985 --> 26:04.904
Guess I could use
a cup of coffee.

26:09.159 --> 26:12.394
You can go too.

26:13.997 --> 26:16.415
Wait outside.

26:18.585 --> 26:21.954
He can kick out five feet,
so stay back at least six.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.797
Teo, it's just you and me.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.163
Your father told me how highly
classified your mission is,

26:34.184 --> 26:37.019
so I didn't want to do anything
to compromise your cover.

26:37.086 --> 26:38.888
What the hell
are you talking about?

26:38.939 --> 26:42.591
Teo...

26:42.642 --> 26:45.227
It's okay.
I know who you are.

26:45.278 --> 26:48.096
Tell me what
the ALC target is,

26:48.148 --> 26:50.816
and I think I can
get you out of here.

26:50.901 --> 26:51.901
Really?

26:51.952 --> 26:54.653
Yeah.

27:21.398 --> 27:23.682
Hey, it's Annie.
I need your help.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.467
I'm here.

27:25.519 --> 27:28.938
I'm at site 6412-Foxtrot
with Teo Braga.

27:28.989 --> 27:32.441
We found a cache of bomb-making
materials at his stronghold.

27:32.492 --> 27:34.360
Were you able
to speak to him alone?

27:34.444 --> 27:38.247
Yes. He was combative
in response to questioning.

27:40.417 --> 27:41.500
I hate to admit this, Joan,

27:41.585 --> 27:43.502
but I think Henry's intel
might bear out.

27:43.587 --> 27:45.621
So what do you need?

27:56.933 --> 28:00.019
What are the parameters for
using extraordinary measures?

28:00.103 --> 28:03.722
Well, you have a threat
on an American target

28:03.807 --> 28:05.024
and a combative prisoner.

28:05.108 --> 28:07.028
That's what extraordinary
measures were made for.

28:07.110 --> 28:08.811
But this is Arthur's son.

28:08.862 --> 28:10.362
I know,
let me handle Arthur.

28:10.447 --> 28:12.514
You just work your mission.

28:12.566 --> 28:15.150
Thank you.

28:15.202 --> 28:16.285
Annie.

28:16.352 --> 28:18.204
Yeah.

28:18.288 --> 28:20.906
I know what happened
on the bridge.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.375
Joan, I'm sorry.

28:23.460 --> 28:26.361
No, I'm sorry
you had to experience that,

28:26.413 --> 28:29.548
but I need you to know
you don't need to worry.

28:29.633 --> 28:32.134
Do you understand?

28:32.201 --> 28:33.135
I do.

28:33.202 --> 28:36.388
You have my support

28:36.473 --> 28:38.474
on whatever you need.

28:38.541 --> 28:40.142
Thank you.

29:13.510 --> 29:16.428
Teo!

29:18.414 --> 29:20.432
What the hell?

29:27.223 --> 29:28.390
Walker!

29:35.899 --> 29:38.984
Teo!

30:09.719 --> 30:11.447
Calder, I need you
to stop for one second

30:11.448 --> 30:12.698
and take a look
at something.

30:12.700 --> 30:13.949
That was the guy you thought
you could turn, huh?

30:14.531 --> 30:16.218
You should've let me shoot him.
Royce.

30:16.777 --> 30:18.240
- Calder?
- Where's that ambulance?

30:18.429 --> 30:20.263
We'll need
four units at RNI.

30:20.314 --> 30:22.065
I have an idea.

30:22.132 --> 30:25.602
I'm in the middle
of cleaning up your last idea.

30:25.653 --> 30:30.240
I know
what Teo's target is.

30:33.310 --> 30:34.911
Yeah?

30:34.978 --> 30:36.196
So right before
he almost killed my guard

30:36.280 --> 30:37.697
he decided to spill
his guts to you?

30:37.781 --> 30:39.115
No,
he didn't say anything.

30:39.166 --> 30:43.002
This is a brochure
for the Jardin Nacional Hotel.

30:43.087 --> 30:45.455
Solstar executives
are coming into town

30:45.506 --> 30:49.959
for a meeting there today.

30:50.010 --> 30:51.461
Look.

30:57.635 --> 31:01.020
There are laptops
full of intel in here.

31:01.105 --> 31:04.641
You do not know for sure
that this meeting is the target.

31:04.692 --> 31:07.176
Maybe he saw a gap
in our security and pounced,

31:07.228 --> 31:09.896
but maybe he was extra motivated
to find that gap,

31:09.980 --> 31:11.231
because he has
an attack to complete.

31:11.315 --> 31:15.535
Are you gonna
wait around to find out?

31:15.619 --> 31:20.540
I hope you have
a bomb squad.

31:20.624 --> 31:22.792
Units five and six,
bring around the trucks

31:22.859 --> 31:26.796
and get Antonio on the phone.

31:26.863 --> 31:29.716
I still do not
trust your ass.

31:34.088 --> 31:35.805
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Campbell.

31:35.872 --> 31:37.673
Are you ready to make
your official statement?

31:37.708 --> 31:40.510
Yes, and I've brought
some accompanying materials,

31:40.561 --> 31:41.511
if that's all right.

31:41.562 --> 31:44.564
Please.

31:52.156 --> 31:56.025
Thank you.
There you go.

31:56.076 --> 31:59.612
I hope you take my candidacy
seriously, Senator Pierson.

31:59.697 --> 32:01.230
I've dedicated
my life to serving

32:01.282 --> 32:02.865
the Central
Intelligence Agency.

32:02.917 --> 32:05.368
Yes.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.194
I'm--I'm sorry,

32:31.261 --> 32:35.782
but I'm going to
have to recuse myself.

32:35.866 --> 32:40.737
Senator Pierson,
is everything all right?

32:40.788 --> 32:44.207
Yes. Yes.

32:47.944 --> 32:51.164
Excuse me, please.

32:57.054 --> 32:59.288
May we begin?

32:59.340 --> 33:02.008
Listen up.
Regular reports from everyone.

33:02.092 --> 33:04.227
Unit five,
sweep for the target.

33:04.294 --> 33:08.564
Unit six,
secure the premises.

33:08.632 --> 33:10.933
Let's go.

33:56.697 --> 33:58.064
Sorry for kicking you.

33:58.148 --> 34:02.702
CIA black sites
are wired to the gills.

34:02.786 --> 34:05.238
I couldn't admit my cover
on the record.

34:08.792 --> 34:10.159
So all of a sudden
you admit

34:10.210 --> 34:12.962
to being
an undercover operative?

34:13.029 --> 34:17.083
After you refused every attempt
I made to help you?

34:17.167 --> 34:19.335
I had a mission
to complete.

34:19.386 --> 34:20.870
Is that why you almost killed
one of the guards

34:20.920 --> 34:22.588
escaping
from the facility?

34:22.672 --> 34:26.141
I know exactly
what I did to him.

34:26.208 --> 34:28.895
I know that four blows
to the head and not five

34:28.978 --> 34:31.764
will be the difference between
the hospital and death.

34:31.849 --> 34:34.400
And that's my position.

34:34.485 --> 34:38.404
The only way to defeat them
is to become one of them.

34:38.489 --> 34:41.357
I need you
to put down the rifle.

34:41.408 --> 34:44.327
I can't do that.

34:55.237 --> 34:57.623
Who are you
trying to kill, Teo?

34:57.708 --> 34:59.926
Just leave me alone or
something very bad will happen.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.178
I can't let you
kill anyone.

35:02.245 --> 35:04.347
Put down the rifle.

35:13.089 --> 35:14.223
I'll shoot you.

35:14.274 --> 35:17.777
If you shoot me,
good people will die.

35:21.064 --> 35:24.734
You can trust me.

35:26.570 --> 35:29.071
Don't do it, Teo.

35:29.123 --> 35:31.824
Do you trust me?

35:42.166 --> 35:45.252
Here. Look.

35:46.921 --> 35:48.555
Those are
Solstar executives.

35:51.825 --> 35:53.626
Who's the man you shot?

35:53.693 --> 35:57.046
His name is Pedro.
Pedro Mendez-Bara.

35:57.131 --> 36:00.216
One of ALC's most devoted.

36:00.300 --> 36:01.834
He could've killed
the entire delegation.

36:01.885 --> 36:04.303
What's the ALC gonna think?

36:04.371 --> 36:07.390
That the CIA has
the best snipers in the world

36:07.474 --> 36:08.724
and they caught up to us.

36:08.809 --> 36:11.677
And now the CIA
is specifically hunting you.

36:11.728 --> 36:14.397
Every man
from the local station chief

36:14.481 --> 36:17.984
to the ex-DCS,
a man named Henry Wilcox.

36:18.051 --> 36:21.154
I am familiar
with the man.

36:21.221 --> 36:24.157
I read that the ALC
is trying to go global.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.691
I believe that's your idea.

36:25.742 --> 36:28.361
I think it's time for
the Puma to take it there...

36:28.412 --> 36:31.030
With help.

36:31.081 --> 36:33.366
I'm not looking
for a partner, darling.

36:33.417 --> 36:34.584
I think I've earned it.

36:34.668 --> 36:36.869
This is the second time
I've saved your life.

36:36.920 --> 36:40.089
Deciding not to kill someone
is not the same as saving them.

36:40.174 --> 36:43.042
Yes, it is.

36:43.093 --> 36:45.795
Here.

36:45.879 --> 36:49.682
Every time this phone rings,
I want you to answer it.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.767
It's untraceable.

36:51.852 --> 36:55.555
Ask any tech,
they'll confirm it.

36:57.191 --> 37:00.476
Take it.

37:01.895 --> 37:03.429
What's the catch?

37:03.480 --> 37:05.114
You gotta
give me something.

37:05.199 --> 37:07.150
A real piece of intel.

37:07.234 --> 37:10.236
A win for you to show off
back at the Agency?

37:10.287 --> 37:12.989
It's not for them.
It's for me.

37:13.073 --> 37:16.292
So I know we have a pact.

37:18.912 --> 37:20.463
Wendy and Xu Chen.

37:20.547 --> 37:22.415
Two Chinese nationals
leaving D.C.

37:22.466 --> 37:26.335
who move billions of dollars
for organizations like ALC.

37:26.420 --> 37:29.839
They moved the money
for that dead guy and his bomb.

37:32.559 --> 37:34.677
We'll be in touch.

37:49.643 --> 37:51.577
Where you been?

37:51.645 --> 37:53.196
Just combing
the perimeter.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.082
You see anyone over there?

37:56.149 --> 37:59.202
No.

37:59.286 --> 38:02.538
Sorry.

38:02.623 --> 38:07.376
So some mysterious gunman
kills a guy out of nowhere.

38:07.461 --> 38:10.880
Apparently.

38:10.964 --> 38:13.132
I've been trying
to sort it out myself.

38:13.183 --> 38:15.134
Really?

38:15.185 --> 38:16.686
Because I have
a nagging suspicion

38:16.770 --> 38:20.839
that you have it
all sorted out already.

38:23.810 --> 38:27.647
It was a pleasure
working with you.

38:27.698 --> 38:30.116
I got a plane to catch.

38:43.630 --> 38:45.214
The gifts
have been pouring in.

38:45.299 --> 38:48.551
There you are.
Thank you.

38:48.635 --> 38:50.536
Can I just say
that it's such an honor

38:50.587 --> 38:53.806
to be working
for the first woman to be DCS?

38:53.873 --> 38:55.273
I feel like
I'm part of CIA history.

38:55.342 --> 38:57.510
And I suppose we are.

38:57.561 --> 38:58.561
Anyways, thank you.

38:58.645 --> 39:00.313
I'm excited to get started.

39:30.677 --> 39:32.511
You're alone.

39:32.579 --> 39:34.297
Sorry, Arthur.

39:34.381 --> 39:36.299
You couldn't get him
out of the black site?

39:36.383 --> 39:37.550
He got out.

39:37.601 --> 39:38.851
Then what?

39:38.918 --> 39:43.389
He took the exit package
and left on his own.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.807
So he refused to see me.

39:44.891 --> 39:47.727
He's leaving Colombia.
He's going deeper.

39:47.778 --> 39:49.895
He even gave us
a new piece of intel.

39:49.946 --> 39:51.731
You were right, Arthur,

39:51.782 --> 39:55.034
he still knows true north.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.987
We succeeded, Arthur.

39:58.071 --> 40:01.157
Okay.

40:01.241 --> 40:05.494
Thank you.

40:05.579 --> 40:10.499
We should take
separate routes home.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.657
<i>Gracias.</i>

40:45.118 --> 40:46.502
You wanna ride home with me?

40:46.586 --> 40:49.505
Oh, as long as I
get the window seat.

40:49.589 --> 40:52.041
You're not calling
from the phone I gave you.

40:52.125 --> 40:53.542
It's a long story.

40:53.627 --> 40:55.994
I've got time.

40:56.046 --> 40:58.431
You think I was crazy
to let him go?

40:58.498 --> 41:00.182
It's okay, you can say it.

41:00.267 --> 41:03.102
I think you were bold.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.604
And boldness is rewarded
in our business,

41:05.672 --> 41:09.775
but what are you
gonna tell Henry?

41:09.843 --> 41:13.446
I'll think of something.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.231
It looks like we pushed
this cheap little battery

41:15.315 --> 41:17.733
as far as it can go.

41:17.818 --> 41:21.737
Save the last bit.
I'll see you soon.

41:32.031 --> 41:35.918
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:36.002 --> 41:38.003
Can I have
my T-shirt back now?
