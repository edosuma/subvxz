WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.040
[Dulcie] Sam O'Dwyer.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.400
He was our first victim.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.360
[Abby] The killer's using the sloop
as his kill-room!

00:10.360 --> 00:11.480
[explosion]

00:12.480 --> 00:17.160
Abby, you really should have told us
Sam O'Dwyer was a serial adulterer.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.320
I wasn't in Deadloch when Dad left.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.920
I was living around the corner
from you and Cath, in Sydney.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.600
Is everything all tense
'cause of the affair Dulcie had?

00:24.600 --> 00:28.280
[imitates Eddie] I'm Eddie Redcliffe!
I'm king effin' shit up in Darwin!

00:28.280 --> 00:29.920
- They don't want me either!
- Why not?

00:29.920 --> 00:32.200
'Cause I... I fucking killed my partner!

00:32.200 --> 00:33.840
[Dulcie] Jesus Christ, Jimmy.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.760
I think our killer
might be a good Christian lady.

00:36.760 --> 00:40.680
Jimmy's place is very bare.
There's just a lot of photos of boats.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.160
And you were both home?

00:43.440 --> 00:44.480
Yep.

00:44.480 --> 00:48.720
[Cath] Skye went and spent $12,000
on something that she won't even say!

00:48.720 --> 00:52.880
The women of the town hate the men.
And she hates them the most.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.880
She knew about the infidelities.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.960
The night Sam died,
Mike gave her a speeding ticket.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.320
She was in Deadloch. She lied.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.000
Skye friggin O'Dwyer.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.120
Bum.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.200
[Aleyna] After a 24-hour hiatus,

01:13.200 --> 01:16.440
I am pleased to announce that
all Feastival events

01:16.440 --> 01:19.280
will be recommencing as scheduled.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.400
Well, not exactly as scheduled.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.240
We have had some minor changes,

01:23.240 --> 01:26.080
which you will note
in these revised programs,

01:26.080 --> 01:29.160
which we printed at 4am
on our home printer,

01:29.160 --> 01:31.480
which, for some reason,
lives in our bedroom.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.000
You will see that
the Immersive Water Sculpture

01:34.000 --> 01:36.280
that was scheduled for tonight
at Deadloch Lake

01:36.280 --> 01:38.400
has, unfortunately, been cancelled

01:38.400 --> 01:41.200
and in its place there will be... Gez?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.920
- Ah, TBC.
- A TBC. Gorgeous.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.039
- Oh...
- Oh?

01:46.039 --> 01:47.840
[Dulcie] So, how do we get play this?

01:47.840 --> 01:49.880
We go in hard with the speeding fine?

01:49.880 --> 01:52.360
We ask her again about her whereabouts
the night Sam O'Dwyer was murdered

01:52.360 --> 01:55.120
and see if she lies to my face again
about that,

01:55.120 --> 01:57.800
like a lying liar who just lies.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.200
Absolutely fucking not.
That's our fucking trump card.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.680
Jesus Christ, you are red-hot right now.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.880
I'm fine. I'm... [stammers] I'm fine.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.520
Yeah, look, you need to
unknot your norks.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.440
You are cutting off the blood supply
to your brain.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.600
It's like a fucking titty tourniquet
right now.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.480
We're just gonna
go into that interview room

02:13.480 --> 02:15.600
and have a casual chat, yeah?

02:15.600 --> 02:17.160
Yeah.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.520
Oh, Jesus Christ, did she bring brunch?

02:19.520 --> 02:22.600
My God, she has absolutely no idea
what's happening here.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.880
So you have nothing?

02:23.880 --> 02:24.880
No.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.079
No, um, no, we don't have nothing.
Um, I actually just...

02:28.079 --> 02:29.520
Far from nothing, I would say.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.800
We just got off the phone
from a phone call,

02:31.800 --> 02:34.160
and I am excited to announce

02:34.160 --> 02:36.440
that we will now be hosting, tonight,

02:36.440 --> 02:40.079
um, an inflatable outdoor cinema event
at Deadloch Lake

02:40.079 --> 02:42.280
that will be called Cinema Aquatica.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.720
Or Floating Flicks.
They're both winning titles, so...

02:44.720 --> 02:47.720
Mayor Rahme, what do you have to say
to Feastival pass-holders

02:47.720 --> 02:51.079
who are afraid of coming to Deadloch
because of the active serial killer?

02:51.079 --> 02:52.280
[laughs]

02:52.280 --> 02:55.000
Um, I think you'll find that
the press suppression order

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
isn't lifted till 11am, Jeremy,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.800
so maybe we'll just do some questions
about the Feastival only.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.800
[Jeremy] Yes, Mayor,
but I think you'll find that

03:01.800 --> 03:05.320
my question was about
Feastival pass-holders.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.440
Mmm.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.240
Well, I would say to them, Jeremy,

03:08.240 --> 03:11.680
that the killer is only targeting
cis-het white men,

03:11.680 --> 03:13.880
and our market research shows that

03:13.880 --> 03:17.600
uh, that's a far cry from
our Feastival patron demographic.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.000
In fact, given that
the victim demographic

03:20.000 --> 03:22.760
is usually responsible
for the perpetration of violence

03:22.760 --> 03:25.960
Deadloch may well be
the safest place to be right now

03:25.960 --> 03:29.240
for many members of
our Feastival community.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.320
So, Joan, you went to
the info booth yesterday.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.720
Did you see anyone
dropping off a bag when you were there?

03:35.720 --> 03:38.360
[chuckles] No, not that kind of bag.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.320
A green bag, Joan.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.600
[Skye] Fuck.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.240
No, I put all this down in the cellar
the night of the Beast on the Cross.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.120
What do you think happened?
The killer broke in and stole it?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.920
[low grunt]

03:49.920 --> 03:53.160
Well, yeah.
Well, that would explain how, um...

03:53.160 --> 03:55.880
how it wound up as part of
a crime scene, wouldn't it, Collins?

03:55.880 --> 03:58.680
- Yeah, that would absolutely
explain all of that.
- [Eddie] That would explain that.

03:58.680 --> 04:02.080
Uh, Skye, given the situation we,
need to get your movements again

04:02.080 --> 04:03.480
for the night that Jimmy Cook died.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.240
- Ah, sure.
- OK, of course. Great.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.600
Also for all the other nights
that all the other men died.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.320
Yeah, well, I wasn't even here
the night Dad died.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.280
- I was in Sydney.
- OK, super-duper, Skye.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.240
Then you shouldn't have any issues
supplying those alibis, then.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.760
Sorry, Mayor, are you saying that
everything is OK

04:20.760 --> 04:23.640
because only
straight, cis, white men are dying?

04:23.640 --> 04:27.920
[laughs] No, Jeremy, that is not...
That is not what I'm saying.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.080
That would be a misinterpretation
of what I said,

04:30.080 --> 04:33.680
'cause I didn't say that
and what I did say was a misspoke.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.080
I misspoke. Um, so...

04:36.080 --> 04:38.200
Uh, thank you, everyone, for coming,

04:38.200 --> 04:41.320
and please enjoy tonight's
Cinema Aquatica.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.720
I hope it really floats your boat. Gez?

04:44.720 --> 04:46.320
- Gez.
- Yes.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.040
- Gez, did that just happen?
- Yes, sweetpea.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.200
OK. Well, then,
you need to take me to the hospital

04:52.200 --> 04:54.720
because I just shot myself
in the fucking face.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.720
[murmurs]

04:55.720 --> 04:58.320
Don't say another word to her.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.800
- I'm fine.
- [scoffs] No, no.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.360
You've got Predator eyes.
They've gone full black.

05:02.360 --> 05:05.320
Hey, Dulce, who do I speak to about
a police report for the Nessie?

05:05.320 --> 05:06.920
I want to file an insurance claim.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.520
Uh...

05:10.520 --> 05:12.240
I can sort that from here.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.200
Yeah, cool. Thanks, mate.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.360
Some of my best memories
are of me and Dad on that sloop.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.080
[Cath] Hello!

05:18.080 --> 05:19.680
Cath, what are you doing in here?

05:19.680 --> 05:21.680
Here to check in on Skye.
Extenuating circumstances.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.920
Oh, my God!

05:22.920 --> 05:24.800
- The killer was in your house?
- Yeah, apparently.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.200
[Cath] Nadiyah said he went through
your stuff. We were both freaking out.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.600
Even I thought, for a second,

05:28.600 --> 05:30.480
you'd been pulled in
for questioning over the murders.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.200
I nearly dug out that
bottle-green Cue suit

05:32.200 --> 05:34.560
and suggested you hired me
as your lawyer.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.680
Why would she hire a vet as a lawyer?
[laughs]

05:36.680 --> 05:38.400
'Cause I used to be a lawyer.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.120
Before I retrained as a vet.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.560
It only takes me
half the time as most people

05:41.560 --> 05:43.360
just 'cause I'm good at everything.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.640
Oh, my God, sexy!

05:44.640 --> 05:47.600
Imagine if the press saw you
escort Skye in here.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.720
They'd be like,
"Skye O'Dwyer is a serial killer!"

05:50.720 --> 05:54.720
Skye, your business
and your reputation will be ruined.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.440
You're coming home with me.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.680
- Mmm... Mm-mm...
- The ute's out the back near the bins.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.160
Just hop in and hide under the dog mat.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.480
- Look, I'm just going...
- Go.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.480
Go.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.320
Oh! Crisis averted!

06:07.320 --> 06:08.960
[laughs] Oh, my God!

06:08.960 --> 06:12.160
Imagine if you'd arrested Skye!

06:13.400 --> 06:15.680
Oh, I would divorce you on the spot.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.160
You're her third-best friend!

06:20.240 --> 06:22.200
Bye, Eddie. See ya!

06:22.200 --> 06:23.200
Bye, Cath.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.880
[Eddie] Alright, time to get
Operation Convict The Cook rolling.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.760
Where's Big Eyes?
She needs to get this DNA sample off.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.800
♪ ♪

06:53.000 --> 06:55.960
Babe, do you get the pressure
I'm under right now?

06:55.960 --> 06:58.680
I'm dealing with a serial killer, yeah?
I'm organising a wedding.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.520
I cannot be expected to deal with
my bride-to-be

07:01.520 --> 07:03.800
randomly disappearing
in the middle of the night.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.120
I didn't disappear.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.360
I was in hospital
because I inhaled a toxic gas.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.440
I was testing the wood
from Jimmy's crucifix.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.640
I think it's coated in
a substance that contains arsine.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.960
It's a chemical that's used
in a treatment called CCA...

07:17.960 --> 07:19.680
Yeah, I know what arsine is, babe.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.560
Yeah, it's a treatment
that's used on boats.

07:21.560 --> 07:24.720
And when you burn it, James,
when you burn, it smells like garlic.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.840
- Really?
- Yeah!

07:25.840 --> 07:28.480
- And that's why
I thought I was smelling garlic.
- Wow.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.080
But then I thought, Sam O'Dwyer's boat,
the Loch Nessie, was burnt,

07:32.080 --> 07:34.000
and so was the wood on the crucifix.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.800
And then I was like,
what if that wood is the same wood?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.480
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe,

07:39.480 --> 07:42.080
can you hear yourself right now, hmm?

07:42.080 --> 07:43.840
Hey, hey, come here.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.440
Babe, you sound insane.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.360
But can't we just check
the Loch Nessie mast?

07:49.360 --> 07:50.840
Where is it?

07:50.840 --> 07:53.480
Hey, it's probably back at the lab.
Look, I'm taking you home, OK?

07:53.480 --> 07:55.240
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm taking you home.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.720
You can catch up on
some much-needed beauty sleep

07:57.720 --> 07:59.280
and then find us a celebrant.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.560
Surely there's an out-of-work actor
who's desperate for the money.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.560
- No, but, James...
- Babe...

08:02.560 --> 08:06.560
You've been poisoned by gas that's
used in chemical warfare, yeah?

08:06.560 --> 08:07.840
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.720
And... you're
out of your little mind, yeah?

08:10.720 --> 08:12.200
- Yeah.
- Yeah, OK.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.040
- OK.
- Let's go wait in the car, OK?

08:14.040 --> 08:15.680
Go wait in the car.
I'm gonna make a quick call.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.120
- OK.
- OK.

08:29.560 --> 08:30.960
Hey, man, how's it going?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.799
Yeah, so, Xave,
quick question about the boat.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.720
[Vanessa] Sorry, Sharelle!
I've never had a job before.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.640
I can tell. Give it here.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.520
Be aggressive.
Soy milk can smell your fear.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.520
Alright, I'm starting without Big Eyes.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.400
I'm like a grog-bog on a Sunday morning.
I cannot be stopped.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.880
So...

09:01.880 --> 09:05.640
We are going to need hard evidence
to tie Skye to these murders

09:05.640 --> 09:09.640
particularly if old mate's lawyer wife
Erin Fuckletits is getting involved.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.520
So we're gonna need witnesses,
DNA evidence, surveillance footage,

09:13.520 --> 09:15.360
one of them lights that spots cat piss.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.960
We need to be sure about this
before we make an arrest, OK?

09:17.960 --> 09:19.240
Otherwise the charges won't stick.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.600
And Dulcie will be blowing up
her entire life for nothing.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.880
Yeah. We want it to mean something
when it all comes crashing down

09:24.880 --> 09:28.840
and Collins is you know,
cold, shivering, sleeping in her car.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.640
OK, Collins, let's timeline this shit.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.160
See how Skye's done it, yeah?

09:36.760 --> 09:38.760
Uh... OK.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.760
Well, I guess I will do the board, then?

09:41.760 --> 09:43.200
- What? No, no.
- No?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.520
No, absolutely not, no.
Don't you touch that board.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.440
My life may be
teetering on the precipice

09:48.440 --> 09:51.640
but at least my writing doesn't
look like the pen's got narcolepsy.

09:51.640 --> 09:55.240
OK, so on the night that
Jimmy was murdered,

09:55.240 --> 10:00.360
Nadiyah said she and Skye
went to bed at 10pm.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.640
But I know that Nadiyah and Skye
are sleeping in separate rooms,

10:02.640 --> 10:04.400
and I know this because
my wife told me this

10:04.400 --> 10:10.200
because I am blended into this situation
like an onion in a soup.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.400
- So Nadiyah's alibi for Skye is...
- Shaky.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.440
Poos.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.640
However, there was an
independently verified sighting of Skye

10:16.640 --> 10:18.520
at 7 o'clock the next morning.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.280
She visited Donna
at The ButchSmith Butchery

10:20.280 --> 10:23.160
to pick up 17 kilograms
of Spanish blood sausage.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.280
Oh, morcilla!
It's pricey and disgusting.

10:26.280 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, it's disgusting. It's made
from the blood of Spaniards.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.520
OK, moving on to Jimmy.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.720
He was last seen at 11pm.

10:33.720 --> 10:39.240
His last phone call was to
Vanessa Latham at 12:23am.

10:39.240 --> 10:43.360
Now, according to Jimmy's autopsy,
he was strangled around 4am.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.320
And liver mortis shows that
he was mounted on the cross

10:46.320 --> 10:51.760
for two hours before he was discovered
by Aleyna at 7:30am.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.240
Is anybody taking notes?

10:53.240 --> 10:55.520
- I thought that's what you were doing.
- No, this is just numbers!

10:55.520 --> 10:57.480
- I'm just doing numbers. Where is Abby?
- [indistinct]

10:57.480 --> 11:00.760
I got a very, very strange
voice-to-text from her.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.000
Something about poussin.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.120
- Poussin?
- Pussy?

11:04.120 --> 11:05.280
Ooh, maybe she wants a recipe from

11:05.280 --> 11:07.040
When Life Gives You
Preserved Lemons.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.520
I'm thinking of
trying the abalone tonight.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.640
That is so wonderful for you, Sven.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.000
- How great.
- Thanks.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.560
OK, given that the bluff
is only accessible by water,

11:15.560 --> 11:18.960
it is very likely the killer
murdered Jimmy on a boat,

11:18.960 --> 11:20.200
just like the other victims.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.040
Now, it is my suspicion that

11:23.040 --> 11:26.280
they are mooring the new kill-room boat
in the same spot as the Loch Nessie,

11:26.280 --> 11:30.800
because serial killers just,
well, they just love routine.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.120
Like babies.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.640
So, if Skye did this...

11:34.640 --> 11:35.680
[exhales loudly]

11:35.680 --> 11:38.440
...somewhere around 5:30am...

11:39.680 --> 11:41.240
...she mounted Jimmy on the cross.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.040
She sailed the new kill-room
back to its parking spot

11:44.040 --> 11:47.080
and then she travelled, in a vehicle,
back to Deadloch,

11:47.080 --> 11:50.280
all in time to pick up
her Spanish blood sausage at 7am.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.760
So, there we have it.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.840
- Cannibal sausage?
- Donna's in it?

11:56.840 --> 11:58.040
- Sausage?
- Like, Donna's part of it?

11:58.040 --> 11:59.440
- [Dulcie] No. No.
- Two words. Give me a clue.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.680
Skye had a 90-minute window
in which to make that trip,

12:02.680 --> 12:04.600
which gives us a search radius

12:04.600 --> 12:06.600
for where she's storing
the new kill-room boat.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.840
Ma'am, sorry I'm late.
I got poisoned.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.440
What?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.760
Oh, bum! Did you start without me?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.040
[beeping]

12:35.880 --> 12:38.920
- [glass breaks]
- [screams]

12:48.880 --> 12:50.760
[breathes shakily]

12:50.760 --> 12:52.440
[Dulcie] OK, Sven,
what am I looking at here?

12:52.440 --> 12:55.440
[Sven] These are all the mooring points,
from Fisheries and Wildlife.

12:55.440 --> 13:00.000
"Pox Bay, Squatter Beach,
Grim Creek, Devastation Point."

13:00.000 --> 13:01.600
Fuck, these place names
are fucking dark.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.280
[Dulcie] OK, we really need to
narrow down these locations.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.920
This is gonna take way too long.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.480
Hey, what's this, um, red stuff
on the Nessie hull?

13:11.480 --> 13:13.680
I noticed that too, ma'am.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.560
Was it parked in mud?

13:15.560 --> 13:16.840
Moored, maybe?

13:16.840 --> 13:18.400
OK, we need to get the soil tested.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.200
That might help us
narrow down these locations.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.080
Do you want me to do it, ma'am? I can.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.360
- I don't. I absolutely don't, Abby.
- I feel much better.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.320
You are basically levitating.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.040
Sven, get onto forensics
about the soil.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.440
No, no, no, mate, come on.
We need to get onto this search.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.160
We can't fucking piss-fart around.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.200
- I can drive a car.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.320
- No. No. No.
- Collins!

13:35.320 --> 13:36.880
- I can walk away.
- [Cath] Dulcie!

13:36.880 --> 13:38.600
- Poo, poo, poo.
- Dulcie!

13:39.800 --> 13:41.240
Told you this would happen!

13:45.520 --> 13:47.960
- [reporters] Detective? Detective?
- This is an absolute disaster.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.160
- Is Skye O'Dwyer a suspect?
- No comment!

13:50.160 --> 13:52.400
- [Megan] Detectives...
- Everybody, clear the area.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.920
OK? Clear it!

13:53.920 --> 13:56.040
You fucking started that rumour,
rat cunt!

13:56.040 --> 13:58.520
- Jesus, Christ, get your head
in the fucking game.
- Do something about this!

13:58.520 --> 14:01.120
Mr McGangus, do you believe
Skye O'Dwyer killed your best friend?

14:01.120 --> 14:02.240
- Do something.
- [Skye] Vanessa!

14:02.240 --> 14:04.520
- You homophobic cunt!
- [Vanessa screams]

14:04.520 --> 14:07.160
[indistinct shouting]

14:07.160 --> 14:09.520
- [screams]
- [McGangus] Get your hands off her,
you lesbian dyke butch!

14:09.520 --> 14:11.280
Why the fuck are you saying
all that bullshit?!

14:11.280 --> 14:12.880
Oi, calm your fucking farm, mate.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.480
- Jesus Christ.
- Nessie's done nothing wrong.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.160
- Oh, you stay out of this.
- Megan gave me four wines!

14:18.160 --> 14:19.520
[McGangus] I know she did,
but you spoke your truth, OK?

14:19.520 --> 14:21.600
You did nothing wrong.
You spoke your truth.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.480
[Jeremy] Councilman McGangus,
how do you feel about

14:23.480 --> 14:24.920
what's happening in your town right now?

14:24.920 --> 14:26.880
[McGangus] Well, I'll let you know
how I feel, Jeremy. Um...

14:26.880 --> 14:29.000
- I don't know this town
anymore, Jeremy.
- [Eddie] Oh, fuck off.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.240
[McGangus] Me best mates are dead,

14:30.240 --> 14:32.960
and what does Mayorette Rahme
have to say about that?

14:32.960 --> 14:34.120
Oh, fuck up, cunt.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.440
- Go inside. Come on.
"Oh, it's OK
- because they're all white men."

14:36.440 --> 14:37.600
- It's a disgrace, OK?
- Come on, Collins.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.000
- Sven, can you get those Carnage Boys
onto that boat search?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I can tell you right now that
the born and breds of Deadloch,

14:41.000 --> 14:45.200
we have had enough of Mayorette Rahme
and her girl gang.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.000
- [applause]
- Thank you.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.960
So we are taking matters
into our own hands, aren't we, Ness?

14:50.960 --> 14:52.920
- Um, yes.
- [McGangus] Yes.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.360
How, Vanessa?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.680
Um, I don't know.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.240
This is such small-town bullshit!

14:59.240 --> 15:00.680
[Cath] You're all coming back
to our place.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.440
- I'm not going to hear
another word about it.
- [Nadiyah] Cath, it's actually fine.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.760
We probably just need some time, like,
to be home for...

15:05.760 --> 15:07.360
- [Cath] Nadiyah!
- ...after a big, um...

15:07.360 --> 15:10.680
Nadiyah, a brick could have come through
and cracked your skull open

15:10.680 --> 15:13.720
and broken it like an egg, and
your brains could be all over the tiles.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.960
Dulcie, you've got to
do something about this.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.760
[Abby] Hey, ma'am,
I'm using voice-to-text

15:19.760 --> 15:22.520
because my brain is moving too fast
for my fingers.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.160
Anyway, I'm at the lake

15:24.160 --> 15:26.040
because the Loch Nessie
used to be moored here

15:26.040 --> 15:28.480
and I thought that maybe
the stains on the hull

15:28.480 --> 15:30.000
would match the lake mud,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.520
but they don't.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.880
Sweetpea. Sweetpea. Sweetpea.
Hey, just slow it down.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.400
Good.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.600
[Abby] The stains on the hull

15:37.600 --> 15:40.720
are definitely much redder
than the lake mud.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.000
Wait...

15:45.000 --> 15:48.640
Ma'am, I think I know what it is.
I'll call you back.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.760
- [bang]
- [Aleyna] Agh!

15:49.760 --> 15:51.320
- Stay calm, everyone.
- [hissing]

15:51.320 --> 15:52.880
Just a flamingo.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.800
[hissing]

15:54.800 --> 15:57.600
[Skye] Vanessa outed me when I was 17
and nearly ruined my life,

15:57.600 --> 15:59.760
and now she's trying to ruin it again!

15:59.760 --> 16:01.080
- [ding]
- And, Mum,

16:01.080 --> 16:03.240
why the fuck is Vanessa
wearing a bakery uniform?

16:03.240 --> 16:05.120
[Vic] I gave her a job.
I felt sorry for her.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.240
[Skye] You read
that fucking article, Mum.

16:07.240 --> 16:11.760
Thanks to her, everyone will think
I'm a fucking psychopath! Right?

16:11.760 --> 16:14.560
No, but you are a chef,
so it's easy to confuse the two.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.640
Yeah, they will. Your name is mud.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.880
Dulce. Mate. You need to call time
on this bullshit.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.560
Clear my name. Make a statement.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.560
You'll do that, absolutely.
Won't you, sexy?

16:24.560 --> 16:26.520
Ah, well, yeah. Um... Well, it's, um...

16:26.520 --> 16:29.760
Um... Unfortunately,
what Collins wants to say is that

16:29.760 --> 16:32.400
we can't, in the position that we're in,

16:32.400 --> 16:35.360
comment at this juncture
of this point of the...

16:35.360 --> 16:36.920
So, toorah, let's go.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.360
- What the fuck!
- Dulcie!

16:39.360 --> 16:42.280
Fucking hell!
That was an emotional bloodbath.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.400
Let's go out on that boat search.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.800
It'll snap you out of this.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.480
You're too tall to have a breakdown.
You'll look like a sad air dancer.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.600
What are these texts from Abby?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.200
[Sven] A green bag.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.280
No, not a sage.
More vibrant than that.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.640
Oi!

16:58.640 --> 16:59.960
Whities!

16:59.960 --> 17:01.480
What's fucking going on here?

17:01.480 --> 17:03.440
Why aren't you out
searching for a fucking kill-room?

17:03.440 --> 17:05.079
Uh, I can answer that.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.839
The search is off 'cause apparently
no-one coming from the north

17:07.839 --> 17:10.000
could have used the Settler Highway
the morning that Jimmy died.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
[Dulcie] Why not?

17:11.000 --> 17:14.440
Well, Mona from the servo said that
a lolly truck went over on a hairpin.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.680
Blocked the whole road with
20 tonnes of Chupa Chups and Sour Worms

17:17.680 --> 17:18.800
for the whole morning.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.560
Spearmint leaf?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.240
[Eddie] Are you fucking shitting me?

17:22.240 --> 17:24.400
Really? A spearmint fucking leaf?
Pass me that box.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.640
[Dulcie] OK, alright,
so the north is out.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.560
Any coast south of Deadloch
within our 90-minute radius

17:31.560 --> 17:34.280
is just vertical cliff-face.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.520
There's nowhere to park a boat.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.080
Moor. Moor the boat.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.520
- OK, we are missing something.
- Yeah.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.040
She must be getting back there
some other way.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.000
Yeah, or she's Bermuda Triangleing us

17:44.000 --> 17:47.320
'cause there is no place to hide
a fucking kill-room boat

17:47.320 --> 17:49.040
unless you involve another dimension.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.760
Sven, how did forensics go

17:50.760 --> 17:53.040
with the soil matching the red stain
on the Loch Nessie?

17:53.040 --> 17:54.480
Well, I delegated that to Abby.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.520
- What? Sven, she's been poisoned!
- She's fucked, mate!

17:56.520 --> 17:58.160
She said she wanted to do it!

17:58.160 --> 18:00.280
She sent me a voice-to-text about it,

18:00.280 --> 18:02.000
like, thinking
she was sending it to you.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.800
Look! There you go.

18:05.240 --> 18:10.560
The bite sitting in our car.
It's sitting in our car. Our car.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.040
- What?
- Our car.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.000
Our car. What is that?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.520
It doesn't understand our accents.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.280
That beach is fucking red, isn't it?

18:17.960 --> 18:20.920
- Where is that?
- [Sven] Oh, that's Carruthers Island.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.640
- Ochre.
- Huh?

18:24.680 --> 18:27.720
Ochre. The boat is sitting in ochre.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.160
[Margaret] And why
the name "Pademelons"?

18:32.160 --> 18:36.520
Well, pademelons feed their babies
to predators to save themselves.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.320
I did not know that.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.320
Yeah, they're cute
but they're cut-throat.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.320
Just like our footy team's going to be.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.920
And that's why I want to
give you the opportunity

18:43.920 --> 18:45.200
to get on the ground floor with us

18:45.200 --> 18:48.000
by becoming our first ever
major sponsor, Margie.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.080
Initial amount TBC,
but I'm thinking 100K?

18:51.080 --> 18:52.520
- Oh, is that all?
- Yeah.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.560
Now, Margie, you know how
you're bankrolling a Palawa woman,

18:54.560 --> 18:56.000
- my cousin here...
- It's...

18:56.000 --> 18:57.760
It's not just a cash injection, darling.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.040
I mean, my girls are my family.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.640
Yeah, awesome, because
the Captain of this team,

19:02.640 --> 19:04.320
she's Palawa, too, on her mum's side,

19:04.320 --> 19:06.160
and Paakantji-Wiradjuri
on her dad's side.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.560
You know, she's a superstar!

19:07.560 --> 19:10.480
She's hot, she's got good hair,
she can sing well.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.800
- Talking about herself.
- Yeah, I figured that, darling.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.000
What do you say, Mrs Carruthers?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.800
We'll name a hyperbaric chamber
after you.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.520
Oh, Tammy...

19:18.520 --> 19:21.040
I just... I love your passion.

19:21.040 --> 19:24.960
But I'm not in a position
to take on more charitable projects.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.560
But why don't you apply for next year's
academic scholarship, hmm?

19:28.560 --> 19:29.920
How are your grades?

19:29.920 --> 19:31.560
They're not as good as my kick, Miss.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.040
Well, unfortunately that scholarship

19:33.040 --> 19:35.800
is designed to set up pathways
for exceptional young ladies

19:35.800 --> 19:37.680
like our Miranda here.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.320
Tammy is exceptional.

19:39.320 --> 19:42.320
Yes, but if I help Tammy,
then another girl like you,

19:42.320 --> 19:44.440
maybe even another Palawa girl,

19:44.440 --> 19:46.320
who's really trying,
who really deserves it,

19:46.320 --> 19:48.080
she wouldn't receive my help,
you understand?

19:48.080 --> 19:50.640
- [phone rings]
- No, I don't understand.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.320
Yeah, aren't you rich? Can't you just
sell another haunted painting

19:53.320 --> 19:54.680
and help out more than one nerd?

19:54.680 --> 19:56.560
I'm sorry. I know it wasn't
what you were hoping for.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.560
But sometimes, trust me,

19:58.560 --> 20:01.760
the best thing for one person
to say to another person is no.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.560
- But, Margaret...
- [shushes]

20:03.560 --> 20:04.920
It's fine, darling.

20:04.920 --> 20:08.080
Maybe next time warn me
before you bring the family over.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.920
My house is beginning to feel like
a drop-in centre. [chuckles]

20:11.920 --> 20:14.920
Take some spiced lard. I have tonnes.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.280
Dulcie, darling! Of course!

20:17.280 --> 20:19.480
No, I'll escort you there myself.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.080
What the fuck is spiced lard?

20:22.080 --> 20:25.320
♪ ♪

20:36.880 --> 20:39.280
You don't like boats too much,
do you, Collins?

20:39.280 --> 20:41.080
[Dulcie] They don't really like me.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.920
I once...

20:42.920 --> 20:46.080
put a ferry out of commission
for a month.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.880
I love boats. I've got a ripper
little speedboat up in Darwin.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.760
Oh, yeah? That's so great.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.200
Can you please
never invite me on that, ever?

20:54.200 --> 20:56.040
I won't be going out on that
for a while.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.080
Why not?

20:58.080 --> 20:59.320
Bushy died on it.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.760
Ah, right, OK. Well, that'd...

21:01.760 --> 21:03.960
Yeah, that would colour things,
wouldn't it?

21:05.320 --> 21:08.640
Um, do you want to talk to me
about that, with you?

21:08.640 --> 21:11.400
We just did. That's enough.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.800
Thanks for escorting us out,
Madame Carruthers.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.880
[Margaret] My pleasure, darling.

21:16.880 --> 21:20.800
Can you just make sure that
everyone stays on the path, OK?

21:20.800 --> 21:23.480
The terrain around here,
it's very dangerous.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.240
How do we get to
the cemetery up there?

21:26.240 --> 21:29.720
Oh, that's off-limits, I'm afraid.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.040
- Why?
- Tiger snakes.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.320
[laughs]

21:33.320 --> 21:35.720
You know, they've been left to
their own devices for far too long.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.640
They're huge, aggressive,
completely unfazed by the weather.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.520
They've really made having sex with
their cousins work for them.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.680
[gags]

21:42.680 --> 21:45.960
OK, well, we'll...
we'll make sure we stick to the shore.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.160
[retches]

21:47.160 --> 21:48.800
- Excuse me.
- Good-o.

21:48.800 --> 21:53.120
I'll stay put here and try not to
antagonise Kevin, if he shows up.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.320
The seal?

21:54.320 --> 21:58.680
Yes! He thinks
this island belongs to him.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.680
He's one of many. [laughs]

22:01.680 --> 22:03.400
- Are you OK?
- [Dulcie] Can you just...

22:03.400 --> 22:05.920
I don't want you to ask me that
because you ask me that

22:05.920 --> 22:09.120
and it just makes everything
so much worse for me, so...

22:09.120 --> 22:11.360
Abby, where's the ochre beach?

22:11.360 --> 22:14.280
Fay said it was on the northwest coast.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.480
She drew a map for me, actually.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.160
Those are tissues.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.160
- Those are tissues.
- OK, yeah.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.720
Abby, how long till
the poison's out of your system?

22:24.720 --> 22:26.320
Only a few more hours,

22:26.320 --> 22:30.200
but the ER doctor said that
I'll be pissing arsenic for weeks.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.920
- [man shouts] Killer dike!
- [car passes]

22:38.920 --> 22:40.880
Not you, your mum!

22:40.880 --> 22:42.040
[ding]

22:59.600 --> 23:01.800
[Hunter] Yeah, that's good C-Dog.
Pump it!

23:01.800 --> 23:03.240
Stop calling me C-Dog!

23:03.240 --> 23:04.480
[boy] One more, bro.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.160
Hey, guys, how's it going?

23:07.160 --> 23:08.600
The fuck are you doing here?

23:08.600 --> 23:11.480
I saw in the group chat you guys
were here, so I came to pump it.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.080
You didn't kick him out
of the group chat?

23:13.080 --> 23:15.360
- I'm not the admin.
- Well, who's the fucking admin, then?

23:15.360 --> 23:16.760
- It's Ronny.
- Where the fuck is he?

23:16.760 --> 23:18.760
He's at the orthodontist.
He's getting his braces tightened.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.240
Oi. Oi!

23:20.240 --> 23:21.880
His Mum is a fucking man-killer!

23:21.880 --> 23:22.840
Fuck, Hunter. Chill out!

23:22.840 --> 23:24.440
His Mum killed fucking Trent!

23:24.440 --> 23:25.680
- And Gavin.
- [Tom] I know.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.200
- And fucking Sam and Jimmy
and some other fucking bloke.
- I know she did.

23:28.200 --> 23:33.280
- Hunter!
- She's a man-hating bitch killer.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.000
Yeah, every chick in this town's
a man-hating bitch, bro.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.200
My mum's a bitch, Ronny's mum's a bitch.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.920
Callum's mum's a fucking bitch.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.840
She just doesn't like sleepovers
on school nights, man.

23:46.840 --> 23:49.160
Our nans are bitches, our teachers.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.840
The canteen lady that banned hotdogs,
she's a bitch.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.960
- [all murmur agreement]
- And Tammy!

23:53.960 --> 23:57.040
Tammy's the biggest fucking bitch
of all, isn't she?

23:57.040 --> 23:58.400
[sighs]

23:58.400 --> 24:00.320
Yeah. She is.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.000
Yeah, she fucking took
Luke Caddy from us.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.920
Shut up about fucking Luke Caddy.

24:03.920 --> 24:07.040
Luke Caddy was Trent's mate.
He's our recruiter.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.080
That fucking dyke bitch
needs to be stopped.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.080
[boy] Yeah.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.280
Two-Mums, I've got a job for ya.

24:15.160 --> 24:18.480
So, hang on, Abby,
you... you thought that Jimmy's crucifix

24:18.480 --> 24:20.240
was made from the Loch Nessie mast?

24:20.240 --> 24:23.560
- I know it's crazy, ma'am...
- No, Abby, that is not at all crazy.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.800
Serial killers want to show
how clever they are

24:25.800 --> 24:27.280
to literally everyone.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.360
Thank you for saying that.
That's actually incredibly validating.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.760
James said I was out of my mind.

24:31.760 --> 24:37.000
Well, you are not, Abby.
You are entirely in your mind.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.600
But the mast is in the lock-up, yes?

24:38.600 --> 24:41.160
Yeah, James says it's at the lab.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.960
[Eddie] Hello, kill-room.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.640
Abby, call forensics.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.240
Yes, ma'am.

24:52.720 --> 24:55.080
- Fuck her.
- Tamara, language!

24:55.080 --> 24:58.240
Nah, I don't need that racist lady,
not with a left foot like this.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.360
That football damages
Aunty Joy's beanie stand

25:00.360 --> 25:02.960
and I'll be cancelling
that Fortnite subscription.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.120
It's called a battle pass,
and we use Tom's.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.480
Well, I'll be getting Tom
to change the password, then.

25:07.480 --> 25:10.160
Good luck trying to get hold of him,
'cause he has ghosted us.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.280
You been holding that for an hour.
You wanna put it down?

25:14.320 --> 25:15.360
It's just...

25:16.800 --> 25:19.760
Why does Margaret Carruthers
get to decide who deserves what?

25:21.160 --> 25:24.160
She doesn't know better than us
about what we need.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.840
She just knows how to jar beef fat.

25:26.840 --> 25:30.960
I know her money could help me,
but the way she talked about Tammy...

25:30.960 --> 25:35.880
The thought of going to that school
of hers just makes me feel... sick.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.880
And it's not just because
the uniform looks like diarrhoea.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.080
Bub, that sick feeling?

25:49.080 --> 25:51.240
You listen to it.

25:51.240 --> 25:52.640
That's our ancestors.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.840
That's thousands of years of wisdom

25:54.840 --> 25:58.880
telling you it ain't worth
your integrity as an Aboriginal woman.

25:58.880 --> 26:02.360
No money and fancy school
with a wellness centre's worth it.

26:02.360 --> 26:06.080
You don't need a leg-up from her.
You got two legs.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.480
Put one foot in front of the other,

26:09.480 --> 26:12.560
and you'll make a life for yourself
you can be proud of, bub.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.920
O... K.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.440
[exhales]

26:35.080 --> 26:38.960
Hey, Mum, how fast do you reckon
Aunty Joy could knit?

26:38.960 --> 26:40.920
The recruiter's coming in
a couple of days,

26:40.920 --> 26:43.640
and I need, like, 18 footy jumpers.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.600
Hi.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.800
Hello, ghost dog.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.720
Your new mates dumped you, did they?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.680
You wanna stay for a feed?

27:02.800 --> 27:04.600
Sorry, James, the reception's
really bad out here.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.200
I'm just getting to higher ground.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.760
We need forensics out here.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.800
- Babe, the celebrant?
- No, I haven't found one.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.760
Abby, Abby, you need to
pick up the slack on your end, yeah?

27:13.760 --> 27:15.360
We're getting married in a week.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.000
Actually, James, I think we need to
cancel the wedding.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.960
Oh, my God,
I am so relieved you said that.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.080
Really?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.960
Yeah, there is way too much
going on right now, babe.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.080
We absolutely need to
postpone the wedding.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.440
Postpone? No, James...

27:33.440 --> 27:36.360
I'll be honest, Abs,
I need a break, yeah?

27:36.360 --> 27:39.120
I mean, his investigation has been
entirely about what you need

27:39.120 --> 27:40.560
and I don't think you actually realise,

27:40.560 --> 27:42.440
but it's taken a huge toll on me.
I mean...

27:43.560 --> 27:45.080
[slightly indistinctly]
...if you don't prioritise me,

27:45.080 --> 27:46.320
and I don't prioritise me,

27:46.320 --> 27:48.360
then who prioritises me, Abby?
"No-one" is the answer.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.640
- I don't want to postpone
the wedding, James!
- And I deserve better.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.360
I'm breaking up with you!

27:52.360 --> 27:54.840
- What are you doing here, sweetheart?
- Um...

27:54.840 --> 27:56.600
I said this was off-limits, darling.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.000
- I'm sorry Mrs Carruthers.
- It's like Medusa's head up here.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.120
Yeah.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.360
- You'd better get back down
before you get bitten.
- OK.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.080
- Off you go. Come on.
- Yes. Yes, ma'am. Sorry.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.400
No, no, it's fine. It's fine.

28:06.440 --> 28:08.680
Be careful on the steps down.
They can be awfully slippery.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.760
OK.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.960
[Eddie] This is a good-looking boat.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.960
What happens to this
when it's not a crime scene anymore?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.360
Perhaps une certain member
of the force

28:50.360 --> 28:52.080
gets a "fucking good job"
boat bonus, yeah?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.720
- Detective.
- What is it?

28:56.280 --> 28:57.480
- Gimme a boost.
- What? No.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.520
- Come on, I'll put it right back.
- Don't... You can't... Ugh.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.240
[Eddie] Just come on. Come on.
One, two, three, go.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.680
[both grunt]

29:03.680 --> 29:05.880
Ah, yep. Ah, hang on. I've got it.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.200
- Put me down. Fuck! My cooch!
- OK.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.600
- Jesus Christ, drop me!
- Alright!

29:10.600 --> 29:11.920
Fucking hell!

29:11.920 --> 29:13.200
[exhales]

29:16.480 --> 29:18.120
That's Jimmy's jacket.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.440
Yeah.

29:19.440 --> 29:22.760
Need to run that against your mate's
DNA. See if it's a matchy-match.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.920
What's that look?

29:32.880 --> 29:35.680
Why do you look like
a dead dog right now?

29:35.680 --> 29:37.200
This doesn't feel right.
This isn't right.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.320
No! Don't fucking choke on me now.

29:39.320 --> 29:43.400
Why would Skye carelessly leave
Jimmy's jacket on board?

29:43.400 --> 29:46.120
That is inconsistent with
how fastidiously

29:46.120 --> 29:48.640
she planned and executed
the other murders.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.000
It's also inconsistent
with her chronic perfectionism.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.840
So she dropped the ball.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.720
So what? She's got a fucking
punishing murder schedule.

29:55.720 --> 29:59.160
No, Skye is relentlessly inflexible,
uptight, anally retentive.

29:59.160 --> 30:02.920
I know this, because it's what
drew me to her as a friend.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.520
Listen, mate, I know you don't want to

30:04.520 --> 30:07.800
fucking shit on your nice life
here in Deadloch

30:07.800 --> 30:10.400
but your fucking
paddock-to-pussy chef mate

30:10.400 --> 30:11.640
should have thought about that

30:11.640 --> 30:14.080
before she started
cutting blokes' tongues out, OK?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.400
She's the one who's
fucked this up, not you.

30:16.400 --> 30:20.400
Collins, she is mooring the boat here

30:20.400 --> 30:24.320
and then she is
swimming back to Deadloch

30:24.320 --> 30:26.520
like a fucking... like a murder eel, OK?

30:26.520 --> 30:27.800
We saw it in that cookbook -

30:27.800 --> 30:30.280
she did it when she was a kid
and she's doing it again now.

30:30.280 --> 30:34.440
Ma'ams? I think Jimmy had
an ad for this boat in his meat locker.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.680
That's the Windbreaker.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.800
That's Rachel Haddick's boat.
She was selling it.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.040
That's the fucking Windbreaker.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.920
That's the effing Windbreaker.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.640
Ma'ams, I think it's the Windbreaker.

30:58.640 --> 30:59.920
- Yes, Abby, that's just what we said.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.760
- That's what we just said.
- Where did you get that from?

31:01.760 --> 31:03.240
- Sorry, I couldn't hear.
- OK.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.560
[Rachel] Yeah, used to be Geoff's boat.

31:14.560 --> 31:17.800
It's been on the market for months,
though. No-one wanted it.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.760
Probably because of Geoff
and him setting fire to the farmhouse.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.600
- Trying to kill me.
- Mmm.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.320
So you didn't sell the Windbreaker?

31:24.320 --> 31:26.520
Oh, no, we did. Three days ago.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.280
That's how we got the camper.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.920
We're going off around Australia,

31:29.920 --> 31:33.480
doing waterfall to waterfall before
climate change dries everything up.

31:33.480 --> 31:37.160
You and Cath putting in the offer on the
hobby farm was such good timing, Dulce.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.520
You know they've upgraded

31:38.520 --> 31:40.200
the glow worm trail
at Mount Mountain Park?

31:40.200 --> 31:41.520
Sorry, Cath put in an offer?

31:41.520 --> 31:44.520
Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah, lesbians,
fucking glow worms, blah, blah, blah.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.480
Who'd you sell the boat to?

31:46.480 --> 31:48.400
I think he said his name was James.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.400
No, it was Jimmy.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.240
You know, the one who
masturbates outside choir.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.400
- Wait, wait, Jimmy... Jimmy Cook?
- Yeah.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.240
Who was murdered yesterday morning?

31:58.240 --> 32:00.920
He was murdered? Oh, my God!

32:00.920 --> 32:04.720
We had no idea. We have been
so absorbed in the camper trailer.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.720
It has soft-closing drawers.
Do you want to have a look?

32:06.720 --> 32:10.200
How the fuck could Jimmy afford
a $12,000 boat?

32:10.200 --> 32:11.680
He was on the bones of his arse.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.520
Hang on, did you say $12,000 dollars?

32:13.520 --> 32:15.000
Gosh, Lainey, now you've got me worried.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.680
Well, check the net banking.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.880
Did the bank transfer go through?

32:18.880 --> 32:21.400
Rachel, who paid for the boat?

32:21.400 --> 32:23.560
Nah, that can't be right.

32:23.560 --> 32:24.840
Who is it?

32:26.280 --> 32:27.840
Skye.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.840
"Skye Anne O'Dwyer."

32:29.840 --> 32:31.720
[Lainey] Anne? I didn't know
her middle name was Anne.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.360
[Rachel] It's a terrible middle name.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.600
[Aleyna] Thank you so much to

32:38.600 --> 32:41.520
all the patrons who
made it out here this evening.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.200
Unfortunately some of our ticket holders
couldn't make it.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.560
Perhaps they're all at the hospital

32:46.560 --> 32:48.840
recovering from
a car accident they manifested

32:48.840 --> 32:52.520
'cause they just needed a little break
from... all the shit.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.640
Anyway, the Deadloch Winter Feastival

32:55.640 --> 32:59.960
is very proud to premiere
a new filmic artwork.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.960
It's by local filmmaker, Joan Lamont.

33:01.960 --> 33:04.600
It is called Poseidon's Uterus.

33:04.600 --> 33:08.040
It's an ode to water
and the divine feminine.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.400
And it goes for four hours.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.320
Fuck my arse, Joan. Really?

33:12.320 --> 33:14.520
So, Nance, just wondering
if you saw anyone at the info booth

33:14.520 --> 33:16.720
dropping off chains and hooks?

33:16.720 --> 33:18.080
- Yeah, in a green bag.
- [phone rings]

33:18.080 --> 33:20.520
Yes, I know it was unmanned.
I was stuck in the toilet.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.800
No, my pelvic floor is fine,
thanks, Nance.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.960
I get rave reviews, trust me.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.960
Hello, Detective Collins' phone.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.600
- Hello, Mrs Carruthers.
- [Sven] You know
what I'm talking about.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.320
- Ooh!
- OK. I'll come in the morning.

33:34.320 --> 33:35.840
[Sven continues indistinctly]

33:35.840 --> 33:38.720
Sure. Now is good too.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.480
Aleyna wanted to borrow this
for the outdoor cinema.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.960
I said absolutely not.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.440
I'm not having some mainland straights

33:46.440 --> 33:48.800
fart all over
my $400 self-inflating mattress,

33:48.800 --> 33:50.360
thank you very much.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.480
[Cath continues indistinctly]

33:53.920 --> 33:54.960
Skye.

33:54.960 --> 33:59.520
I'm making us $200 Iberico ham toasties.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.120
It's not like
the restaurant's gonna want it.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.480
Skye...

34:03.480 --> 34:05.880
How much do you reckon we'll get
for the wine in the cellar?

34:05.880 --> 34:09.440
I mean, maybe I should just
fucking drink it all at once.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.560
- Take my liver for a spin...
- Skye!

34:14.679 --> 34:16.600
[whispers] The night of
Jimmy Cook's murder...

34:17.840 --> 34:20.400
...I told the police that
you were in bed all night.

34:22.920 --> 34:27.920
But at 12:30, when I got up to wee,
you weren't there.

34:27.920 --> 34:30.360
So I checked the whole place,
and you weren't anywhere.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.360
So?

34:35.560 --> 34:39.920
So you lied. You don't have
an alibi for Jimmy Cook's murder.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.800
[laughs]

34:41.800 --> 34:44.440
Nadiyah, fucking get off it!

34:45.520 --> 34:47.800
You lied to the police, Skye.

34:47.800 --> 34:51.400
You have never talked about your Dad.
Tom has never met his Grandad.

34:51.400 --> 34:54.520
And you don't talk to me about anything

34:54.520 --> 34:59.880
except how much you hate this town
and all of the men in it,

34:59.880 --> 35:02.040
particularly the Lathams.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.760
And ever since Trent was murdered

35:03.760 --> 35:05.320
you and your Mum

35:05.320 --> 35:08.600
have been creeping around like
you're the fucking Hamburglar twins.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.160
What am I supposed to think?

35:12.160 --> 35:14.200
Do you have anything to say to me?

35:18.200 --> 35:21.280
- Also, I'm pregnant. And, um...
- What?

35:21.280 --> 35:24.920
I cannot be
committed to this relationship

35:24.920 --> 35:26.840
if you are a serial killer.

35:26.840 --> 35:29.640
- I'm fine with just a doona, love.
- [Cath] No, no, no, Vic.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.560
I refuse to believe
we've got 10 bottom sheets

35:31.560 --> 35:34.480
and zero bloody top sheets.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.120
Oh, sexy! You said you'd be
working late tonight.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.640
Skye.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.040
We need to talk to you.

35:40.040 --> 35:42.440
Ah, Dulce, now is not a good time, mate.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.040
This isn't a request.

35:49.160 --> 35:53.080
Interview of Skye O'Dwyer,
commencing at 7:12pm.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.640
You can't interview her like this.
She's been drinking.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.520
Yes, we can, Cath. It's not illegal.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.160
And no judge will accept
her testimony, Dulcie.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.200
That's a problem for
another day, Cath.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.360
Alright, what can you
tell us about this?

36:07.120 --> 36:09.840
Well, Detective,
that's what you call a boat.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.760
Great start! Great start.

36:14.760 --> 36:15.880
Nothin' else?

36:15.880 --> 36:17.400
- Nuh.
- [Dulcie] Really?

36:17.400 --> 36:20.440
Because you deposited
$12,000 into Rachel Haddick's account

36:20.440 --> 36:21.920
to pay for this boat.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.120
We also know
you spent $12,000 on something

36:24.120 --> 36:26.280
and wouldn't tell Nadiyah
what that something was.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.080
- Dulcie, I told you that in confidence.
- Cath!

36:29.080 --> 36:30.920
We found this boat at Carruthers Island.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.040
And on board was a jacket
belonging to Jimmy Cook.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.600
He was wearing it the night
he was murdered

36:35.600 --> 36:39.280
and we just got told
it's absolutely covered in your DNA.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.680
Skye, did you buy this boat
and murder Jimmy on board?

36:43.680 --> 36:44.920
What?

36:44.920 --> 36:46.920
[Eddie] Did you buy this boat
and use it as a kill-room

36:46.920 --> 36:49.840
because you set fire to the Nessie
when you found out that we were onto it?

36:49.840 --> 36:52.200
No! Dulce, that is not my boat.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.520
Then whose boat is it, Skye?

36:53.520 --> 36:55.920
It's Jimmy's boat. I bought it for him.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.360
Why the hell would you
buy Jimmy Cook a boat?

36:58.360 --> 37:00.080
Because he was blackmailing me.

37:00.080 --> 37:02.800
So that's why the DNA
is all over his jacket,

37:02.800 --> 37:05.880
because I roughed him up
when I paid him off.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.320
Why was he blackmailing you? Hey?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.680
Did he find out about you
and those dead blokes?

37:24.360 --> 37:26.840
Skye, did you know
about your Dad's affairs?

37:28.200 --> 37:29.600
Is that why you killed him?

37:29.600 --> 37:31.160
Dulcie!

37:46.280 --> 37:48.880
Thank you for coming so late, Abby.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.160
That's OK.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.560
Here it is.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.600
I know this is Miranda's earring,

37:53.600 --> 37:56.640
which means she's been
trespassing on my land.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.600
Oh, I'm sure it was a misunderstanding.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.400
But I can talk to her if you want me to.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.440
Would you?

38:05.440 --> 38:07.680
I think a visit from the police
might give her the little start

38:07.680 --> 38:09.640
she needs to behave,

38:09.640 --> 38:12.360
before she goes the way of her aunt,
and that cousin of hers.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.920
Um, I'll have a chat to her, then.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.920
Oh, you are a dear. Thank you.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.640
- Um, is it OK if I hold onto
this earring, just for evidence?

38:20.640 --> 38:22.400
Oh, of course. You'll need that.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.480
Yeah.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.600
- Off you go.
- Oh, OK.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.960
- Thank you, Mrs Carruthers.
- Thank you.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.040
- Take some spiced lard!
- Oh. Yeah.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.520
- It's lovely.
- Um...

38:36.840 --> 38:38.440
Take two. I have heaps.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.480
- Oh! Thank you.
- [laughs] Mmm.

38:41.480 --> 38:42.520
[door closes]

39:00.600 --> 39:03.560
Let's talk about your old mates,
Trent and Gavin Latham.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.760
Must have been pretty rough for you
at the footy club,

39:07.760 --> 39:11.120
being the only girl on the team
amongst all those homophobes.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.160
Seen the graffiti around town about ya.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.760
- It's pretty anti-lesbian.
- [softly] Fuck!

39:15.760 --> 39:18.160
You uncovered my big secret.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.640
I was a closeted gay kid
in a homophobic country town

39:21.640 --> 39:25.160
and it didn't go well for me,
and that made me do murders!

39:25.160 --> 39:26.520
You two are good!

39:26.520 --> 39:28.600
Skye, why did you stay away
from Deadloch all those years?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.480
Because when Vanessa outed me,

39:30.480 --> 39:33.160
Trent and his fucking footy boys
bullied the shit out of me,

39:33.160 --> 39:34.680
and then the adults,

39:34.680 --> 39:37.440
including Rod Dixon and my own Dad
got involved.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.800
So, yeah, you bet
I stayed the fuck away.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.680
And then a year ago you came back.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.960
Yeah.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.640
I just thought, fuck it.

39:44.640 --> 39:47.360
I've just as much right to be here
as those dickturds.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.440
Mm-hm. Made your triumphant return
after 22 years.

39:49.440 --> 39:50.480
Yeah.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.640
- Hadn't stepped foot back before then?
- Nope.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.440
What's that?

39:58.440 --> 40:00.400
I can't see what it says.
I forgot my glasses.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.000
It's a speeding fine
given out by Mike Nugent

40:02.000 --> 40:05.760
to Skye Anne O'Dwyer
on June 10th, 2017.

40:05.760 --> 40:06.920
Oh, OK.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.640
So Skye was back for a day.
Jesus, Dulce!

40:09.640 --> 40:14.000
June 10th 2017 was the night
Sam O'Dwyer was murdered.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.160
Mate...

40:15.160 --> 40:17.680
You told me you were in Sydney, Skye.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.360
You have repeatedly lied to me...

40:20.360 --> 40:22.120
None of this is
what you think it is, mate!

40:22.120 --> 40:23.600
Then what is it, mate?
Just tell me, mate!

40:23.600 --> 40:25.480
Skye, as your lawyer,
I suggest you don't say anything.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.200
Cath, no, I've had a gutful. [stammers]

40:27.200 --> 40:28.320
- You want to know?
- Mm-hm.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.600
Vanessa was right.
I did hate all those men.

40:30.600 --> 40:34.040
My Dad was a cunt.
So was Rod Dixon, Trent, Gavin.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.920
They made
this little lesbian's life hell.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.840
And you know what?
I'm fucking stoked they're dead.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.440
I am!

40:40.440 --> 40:42.960
But I didn't kill them. I didn't.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.840
Because it turns out it is possible
to hate someone

40:45.840 --> 40:49.120
and want them dead
with every inch of your fucking being

40:49.120 --> 40:50.960
and not fucking murder them!

40:50.960 --> 40:54.440
Then why did you come back to Deadloch
the night your Dad died?

40:55.880 --> 40:57.080
No comment.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.760
I mean, you can be really angry
and not kill. That's true, isn't it?

41:04.760 --> 41:07.040
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Heaps of people don't kill.

41:07.040 --> 41:10.280
Yeah, exactly. I agree with that.
So, you know, maybe she didn't do it.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.280
- OK
- OK, OK.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.480
But she came back to Deadloch
that night,

41:15.480 --> 41:17.920
something happened,
and she's not telling us the truth.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.760
Yep. And whatever she did,
Jimmy knew about it.

41:20.760 --> 41:23.000
Yeah, yeah.
And now he's dead, isn't he, so...

41:23.000 --> 41:25.760
Ooh, yeah, yeah. Nah, he's dead.
He is very dead.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.200
Yeah.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.600
[sighs]

41:28.600 --> 41:31.000
I'm going to go home and check on
Nadiyah, Vic and Tom.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.280
They'll be out of their minds
'cause Skye's behind bars in a lock-up

41:33.280 --> 41:35.040
with only one roll of toilet paper.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.800
- Cath, I...
- Can I just have a private word
with Dulcie please, Eddie?

41:38.800 --> 41:42.360
I know you're partners at work,
but we're still partners in life.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.360
Yep, no worries. I'll just...

41:48.280 --> 41:49.800
- Chookas.
- Yeah.

42:05.160 --> 42:07.760
[exhales] OK.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.560
[rustling]

42:11.440 --> 42:13.160
Oh! [coughs]

42:13.160 --> 42:14.760
Fucking spearmint leaves.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.760
Hey, Eddie.

42:46.120 --> 42:49.440
Um, have you seen Cath?
I've been trying to call her.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.920
Ah, yeah, she's, uh...
back at the station.

42:52.920 --> 42:57.560
But I'd give her a wide berth.
She's... raring for a fight.

42:57.560 --> 43:01.080
She's like one of them
frill-neck lizards doing one of these...

43:01.080 --> 43:02.800
- [hisses]
- Agh!

43:02.800 --> 43:04.080
- You know?
- OK.

43:05.160 --> 43:06.160
Um...

43:07.440 --> 43:10.480
Probably don't need to see her anyway.
It's a bit beyond that now. Um...

43:11.680 --> 43:12.880
Lou's dead.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.600
Oh, fuck!

43:16.600 --> 43:18.480
Not another one.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.640
Ugh! Who's Lou?

43:20.640 --> 43:22.760
One of them fucking
salty sea-dog fishermen

43:22.760 --> 43:24.160
with the gold teeth down on the water...

43:24.160 --> 43:25.960
Lou's my donkey.

43:25.960 --> 43:28.520
- Oh, that's not... That's shit.
- Yeah, it is.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.080
She was my best friend.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.520
Oh, no.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.480
- Um...
- Are you OK?

43:45.640 --> 43:46.720
[sighs]

43:49.000 --> 43:51.360
Um, see...

43:51.360 --> 43:53.480
the thing is, Ray Pies, um...

43:54.480 --> 43:56.960
I don't have a best friend,

43:56.960 --> 43:58.800
because, um,

43:58.800 --> 44:01.160
my best friend died, too.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.120
Did he? Oh, no.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.680
[both sniffle]

44:05.680 --> 44:09.360
Yeah, my best friend died,
and your donkey died,

44:09.360 --> 44:12.840
and... and all the good ones die,
Ray Pies.

44:12.840 --> 44:14.160
- I know!
- So... Yeah.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.560
[both cry]

44:18.560 --> 44:21.240
Can I, um, can I
come home with you, Ray Pies?

44:21.240 --> 44:23.880
I think... I think I need a gruck.

44:23.880 --> 44:26.760
- I'd really like that, yeah.
- Yeah. OK.

44:26.760 --> 44:29.200
- What's a gruck?
- It's a grief-fuck, mate.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.520
- OK.
- Yeah. Right.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.840
- Hop in.
- OK.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.400
Yeah. [sniffles]

44:40.400 --> 44:41.960
[engine starts]

44:45.440 --> 44:48.680
Thank you to my family, my team mates...

44:49.960 --> 44:52.120
...Luke Caddy,
for always believing in me...

44:53.440 --> 44:55.800
- ...the Brownlows...
- [Tom chuckles]

44:55.800 --> 44:59.560
- My beautiful wife, Kehlani.
- [chuckles]

44:59.560 --> 45:01.840
I would not like to thank...

45:02.920 --> 45:06.000
...Margaret Carruthers,
because she is a racist dog.

45:07.240 --> 45:09.480
And, of course... [laughs]

45:09.480 --> 45:14.280
...I would like to thank you,
beautiful sports drink bong,

45:14.280 --> 45:18.440
for giving me the opportunity to
smoke weed one last time

45:18.440 --> 45:19.920
before I go pro.

45:19.920 --> 45:22.160
[bubbling]

45:22.160 --> 45:25.160
You know, I knew
there'd be water in this,

45:25.160 --> 45:29.840
but, if I'm honest, I wasn't expecting
to see so much of Joan's breasts.

45:29.840 --> 45:32.360
I'm not watching it, Gez.
Checking emails.

45:32.360 --> 45:35.480
Amanda Palmer's just officially
pulled the pin, that absolute skank.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.480
What, is that it?

45:37.480 --> 45:39.320
- A very jarring ending.
- What the hell?

45:39.320 --> 45:43.280
- No.
- [Vanessa on loudspeaker] We demand
that Mayor Rahme cancel the Feastival.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.280
- Five men are dead.
- [crowd murmurs]

45:45.280 --> 45:47.400
Enough is enough.
Cease the Feast.

45:47.400 --> 45:49.520
- That's right. Louder.
- Cease the Feast.

45:49.520 --> 45:51.920
- Louder, louder! Cease the Feast!
- [shouts] Cease the Feast!

45:51.920 --> 45:54.160
[all chant] Cease the Feast!
Cease the Feast!

45:54.160 --> 45:56.720
"Cease the Feast."
Take me back to shore.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.240
- Get me back there, Gez.
- I don't have an oar.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.480
Why don't you have any oars?

45:59.480 --> 46:01.280
- [roars]
- [indistinct clamouring]

46:01.280 --> 46:04.000
All the men in my life are dead!

46:04.000 --> 46:05.240
- Shuffle.
- Shuffle.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.400
- Shuffle.
- [shouts indistinctly]

46:07.400 --> 46:08.760
[shouts]

46:09.840 --> 46:12.560
[Cath] Over the past five years,
I've worked so hard

46:12.560 --> 46:14.040
at trying to stop the narrative
in my head

46:14.040 --> 46:15.720
that tells me that you don't love me.

46:15.720 --> 46:16.840
Cath, I...

46:16.840 --> 46:19.480
Your behaviour lately
is making it really hard

46:19.480 --> 46:23.160
for me to believe that you actually
care about our relationship, Dulcie,

46:23.160 --> 46:26.520
about our dogs, about our life
in Deadloch, about our friends.

46:26.520 --> 46:29.880
I mean, you've completely ruined
our friendship with Skye.

46:29.880 --> 46:33.440
Bringing up all of that stuff
about her dad and the affairs...

46:33.440 --> 46:35.960
OK, I didn't... I didn't bring it up.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.160
- What did you say?
- You ruined our friendship with Skye.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.240
No, not that, not that.
The bit before that.

46:42.440 --> 46:44.840
I mean, did you know that
Sam was cheating?

46:47.280 --> 46:48.840
Did you know that
Skye knew about the cheating?

46:48.840 --> 46:51.360
- Well, yeah, I suppose.
- Cath!

46:52.400 --> 46:53.880
We're dealing with a serial killer here,

46:53.880 --> 46:57.440
one whose... whose killing spree
started with Sam's murder.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.440
You didn't think that that might be,

46:59.440 --> 47:02.920
I don't know, just...
just useful information to tell me?

47:02.920 --> 47:05.200
Well, it's not my story to tell.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.560
I... [sighs]

47:06.560 --> 47:09.000
I don't know why you're upset at me.
These are my friends!

47:09.000 --> 47:10.480
This is my life you're messing up.

47:10.480 --> 47:12.560
Yeah, it is.
That is right, it is your life.

47:12.560 --> 47:14.400
All of this, this is your life.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.920
You decide where we live, what we eat,

47:16.920 --> 47:20.040
when we put a deposit down
on a hobby farm.

47:20.040 --> 47:21.640
I know about that, by the way.

47:21.640 --> 47:24.160
You decide what... what pets we have.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.880
I didn't want a new dog!

47:25.880 --> 47:29.480
And you know what else?
I don't want to run a damn dog motel.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.280
Let's not say insane things
we can't take back.

47:31.280 --> 47:33.720
No. No, I think it's a silly idea

47:33.720 --> 47:35.640
and it's a useless contribution
to the world.

47:35.640 --> 47:40.400
And here's another one -
this is a... a really big one.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.920
I love being a detective.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.520
And the only reason that I quit is
because you guilted me into it.

47:46.520 --> 47:50.240
In fact, you know what, Cath,
our entire life here

47:50.240 --> 47:54.200
is built around you guilting me
into giving you what you want,

47:54.200 --> 47:57.240
into living this life - your life -

47:57.240 --> 48:00.320
that is making me really unhappy.

48:01.320 --> 48:03.800
- You're unhappy?
- Yes!

48:03.800 --> 48:05.440
How am I supposed to know that?

48:05.440 --> 48:07.680
How am I meant to know if you're unhappy

48:07.680 --> 48:10.720
if you just... just put everything
into your vault of repression?

48:10.720 --> 48:12.360
You don't tell me that you're unhappy.

48:12.360 --> 48:13.560
You could ask.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.720
What do you want to do, then?

48:18.720 --> 48:20.520
I mean, move back to Sydney
where we were stressed,

48:20.520 --> 48:23.120
and fighting and everything was uphill?

48:23.120 --> 48:24.280
No. No.

48:24.280 --> 48:27.000
What do you want, then, Dulcie,
if it's not this?

48:28.040 --> 48:30.120
Like, if it's not this life

48:30.120 --> 48:33.440
that I created thinking it was
what we both wanted,

48:33.440 --> 48:35.520
what the fuck do you want?

48:39.760 --> 48:42.280
- What are you doing?
- When was this photo taken?

48:51.520 --> 48:53.760
June 10th, 2017.

48:55.040 --> 48:56.840
The night Sam died.

49:01.760 --> 49:02.920
[whispers] Cath...

49:04.240 --> 49:05.400
[sighs]

49:07.640 --> 49:09.480
Did you know that Skye
came back to Deadloch

49:09.480 --> 49:11.440
the night of her Dad's disappearance?

49:13.880 --> 49:15.600
Cath.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.440
Look...

49:17.440 --> 49:20.400
Are you kidding me?

49:20.400 --> 49:22.880
Maybe you'd have
remembered the date earlier, Dulcie,

49:22.880 --> 49:26.680
if you were at home babysitting Tom
with me that weekend

49:26.680 --> 49:31.240
instead of fucking some other woman
in a work shower!

49:31.240 --> 49:33.080
- [ding]
- [Ken] Senior Sergeant!

49:34.240 --> 49:36.480
Not now, Ken!

49:36.480 --> 49:38.560
I just wanted to see
if you're finished with that bag?

49:38.560 --> 49:40.760
The green one
I dropped at the info booth.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.800
I need it for tomorrow's shop.

49:46.200 --> 49:47.720
Don't you dare go out there.

49:48.920 --> 49:51.360
[tearfully] It's just a job, Dulcie.

49:51.360 --> 49:52.440
Mm-hm.

49:53.720 --> 49:56.640
Yeah, but if I don't do my job,
more people will die, so...

49:58.200 --> 50:00.520
Right now, my job's
more important than us, Cath.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.360
It's more important than you.

50:07.600 --> 50:09.320
[sobs softly]

50:11.600 --> 50:14.720
Those bags cost 90 cents, Dulcie,
and I'd like it back.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.560
Ken, did you find the hooks and chains?

50:16.560 --> 50:19.360
Yeah, on the beach,
with my metal detector.

50:19.360 --> 50:22.200
After they cleaned up
Jimmy's crime scene.

50:22.200 --> 50:25.320
Sorry! Sorry, did you say
"after" it was cleaned up?

50:25.320 --> 50:27.400
That's right, they were just there
on the rocks.

50:28.960 --> 50:30.560
Someone planted it.

50:30.560 --> 50:32.360
- I didn't see any plants there.
- [phone buzzes]

50:32.360 --> 50:35.720
- [sighs]
- I suppose seaweed's a type of plant.

50:35.720 --> 50:37.920
- Aleyna.
- Vanessa Latham has lost it.

50:37.920 --> 50:39.440
I need you to get down here, Dulcie,

50:39.440 --> 50:41.480
because my Cinema Aquatica
is under attack.

50:41.480 --> 50:42.840
[Eddie] Is this your joint?

50:42.840 --> 50:45.640
Did friendly fucking forest creatures
build it for you or something?

50:45.640 --> 50:47.480
[Ray] It's just what rentals
look like here.

50:51.960 --> 50:54.080
Hey, um, hang on a sec.

50:54.080 --> 50:56.600
Before we go inside
your perfect little...

50:57.960 --> 51:00.360
...gingerbread man house...

51:00.360 --> 51:01.920
[inhales]

51:01.920 --> 51:03.480
...I need to say some stuff.

51:03.480 --> 51:04.560
OK.

51:05.960 --> 51:08.040
I'm... I'm...

51:08.040 --> 51:11.360
I'm no good, Ray Pies.

51:11.360 --> 51:14.280
I know you've got the horn for me,
and that is understandable,

51:14.280 --> 51:16.640
because of this hair and these titties,

51:16.640 --> 51:19.080
but your dickie needs to know
what he's getting himself into.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.440
OK.

51:22.440 --> 51:25.800
If your dickie wants to go on
fucking tandem bike rides,

51:25.800 --> 51:28.080
and leave love letters in lunchboxes,

51:28.080 --> 51:30.520
and, you know, eat bird-shit muesli...

51:30.520 --> 51:32.920
- Do you mean bircher muesli?
- Yeah, whatever.

51:32.920 --> 51:35.280
If that's something that your dickie is
into, then...

51:35.280 --> 51:37.280
then tell him to go somewhere else.

51:37.280 --> 51:39.960
I'm not good with nice things, Ray Pies.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.600
'Cause when I get 'em, I just...

51:44.920 --> 51:46.120
...I break 'em.

51:47.800 --> 51:50.600
Eddie, why are you saying this?

51:50.600 --> 51:51.840
'Cause I fucked up.

51:51.840 --> 51:54.840
And now Bushy's gone and everyone
in fucking Darwin fucking hates me

51:54.840 --> 51:56.400
and I... I've got nowhere.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.160
I've got nothing, Ray Pies.

51:58.160 --> 52:00.920
So, you know, I understand if... if...

52:00.920 --> 52:04.080
if you want me to go now as well,
I'll just... I'll go sleep in a bush

52:04.080 --> 52:06.400
or I'll fight a wombat for its burrow,
or whatever.

52:06.400 --> 52:08.160
Eddie, look... Hey! Look... [stammers]

52:08.160 --> 52:09.760
Nobody's perfect.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.920
We've all done things
we're not proud of.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.880
I've made some mistakes with women

52:13.880 --> 52:16.040
and I've had some
pretty weird interests.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.760
When I first moved to Sydney,

52:17.760 --> 52:22.720
I played in a ska-funk-Latin band
called Dog Kingdom

52:22.720 --> 52:25.240
and... we were all white.

52:25.240 --> 52:26.960
With dreadlocks?

52:26.960 --> 52:28.440
Some.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.000
- Off!
- I know.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.280
But the point is...

52:33.280 --> 52:36.560
everybody deserves a chance
to reinvent themselves, right?

52:36.560 --> 52:38.800
So maybe it's time to forgive yourself

52:38.800 --> 52:40.400
let go of the past,

52:40.400 --> 52:42.440
start over and do it better this time.

52:44.040 --> 52:45.600
Are we gonna kiss now? Is that...

52:45.600 --> 52:48.560
The fuck's going on over there?

52:53.400 --> 52:55.520
Holy shit!

53:00.360 --> 53:01.800
Is this...

53:01.800 --> 53:04.520
alien UFO...?

53:04.520 --> 53:07.280
No, it's the aurora australis.

53:07.280 --> 53:09.560
- What?
- Southern Lights.

53:10.960 --> 53:12.000
Who?

53:13.680 --> 53:15.880
Well, there's...

53:15.880 --> 53:20.680
I think there's, like, magnets
on the sun, I think...

53:20.680 --> 53:22.520
No, or it's, um... wind on the sun

53:22.520 --> 53:24.840
that hits magnets on the earth

53:24.840 --> 53:28.040
and then maybe...
something in and around that.

53:29.080 --> 53:31.320
It's so fucking beautiful here.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.640
You're so fucking beautiful here.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.120
Sorry.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.920
- Sorry.
- [faintly] It's OK.

53:47.480 --> 53:48.480
Oh.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.040
Agh... OK. Mmm!

53:52.040 --> 53:55.480
[kissing, grunting]

53:55.480 --> 53:58.080
[Ray] Check it out. Landscape mode.

53:58.080 --> 54:00.720
[Eddie breathes heavily]
Fucking pound it, Ray Pies.

54:01.720 --> 54:03.960
[indistinct shouting]

54:04.960 --> 54:06.320
Bravo, Phil!

54:07.400 --> 54:09.360
Let it go, boys!

54:09.360 --> 54:12.200
Don't even get paid for this.
It's a volunteer position!

54:12.200 --> 54:13.480
Move it!

54:13.480 --> 54:15.440
Get this shark off my face!

54:16.400 --> 54:19.120
- Give me back my lobster!
- You don't deserve lobster!

54:19.120 --> 54:20.720
[Dulcie] Alright, break it up!

54:20.720 --> 54:22.840
- [shouts indistinctly]
- Vanessa, let go.

54:22.840 --> 54:25.040
- Let go! Aleyna, drop it!
- [screams]

54:25.040 --> 54:26.880
Drop it! Drop it!

54:26.880 --> 54:29.360
- I can't swim!
- Vanessa!

54:29.360 --> 54:32.360
Help! Help, help!

54:32.360 --> 54:33.760
Take my hand!

54:33.760 --> 54:35.920
- Stop!
- [screams]

54:35.920 --> 54:38.800
Just stop hitting me!
I'm trying to help you!

54:38.800 --> 54:40.760
- [bubbling]
- [continues shouting]

54:40.760 --> 54:42.800
[screams]

54:42.800 --> 54:45.200
Oh, my God!

54:45.200 --> 54:47.200
They're dead bodies!

54:47.200 --> 54:50.400
[screams]
