- Oh, thanks.

<i>[cheerful music]</i>

01:51.579 --> 01:52.811
- Do you know, Molly,

01:52.880 --> 01:54.179
if Santa catches you working,

01:54.248 --> 01:56.381
you're gonna get coal
in your stocking.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.516
- Hey, Karen.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.519
I just have
to finish this proposal.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.188
- You're missing
all the fun.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.958
And Derrick from accounting
was asking about you.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.126
Didn't you guys
go out once?

02:07.194 --> 02:08.894
- Uh-hmm. We had dinner.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.062
- And?

02:10.131 --> 02:11.396
- And all we spoke about

02:11.465 --> 02:14.199
was Derrick from accounting.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.669
- Done.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.771
- There are other
eligible men out there.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.040
- Well, then,
maybe you should date them.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.675
- Hmm, I would,

02:23.744 --> 02:27.146
I just don't think
my fiancé would approve.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.214
- Yeah.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.082
I don't think mine
would either.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.617
- Your fiancé?

02:31.685 --> 02:32.951
- Yeah.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.786
I'm engaged

02:34.855 --> 02:36.722
to Manchester Software.

02:36.790 --> 02:40.058
We're spending Christmas
together here in the office.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.060
- So, you're working through
another holiday?

02:42.129 --> 02:43.129
- I am.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.307
But don't think of it
as work,

02:44.331 --> 02:46.031
think of it as love.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.100
- Excuse me,

02:47.168 --> 02:49.401
hey, hello everyone.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.803
Can I have your attention
for just a minute?

02:52.740 --> 02:53.740
Hi, everyone.

02:53.807 --> 02:54.807
Merry Christmas.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.275
- Merry Christmas.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.121
- I hope you're all having
a good time tonight.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.978
- Yeah.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.280
- Uh-hmm.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.549
- Now, as most of you know,

03:03.617 --> 03:07.019
we've had a very good year here
at Manchester Software.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.888
Our new product
is very successful,

03:09.957 --> 03:12.191
and I'm very happy
to report

03:12.259 --> 03:13.959
that our latest app

03:14.028 --> 03:17.396
just broke
half a million downloads.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.498
[crowd cheering]

03:19.567 --> 03:22.401
- Because this is all thanks
to you, my team.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.402
[laughs]

03:23.470 --> 03:25.671
And all your hard work.

03:25.739 --> 03:29.374
But, I'd especially like
to thank Molly Clark,

03:29.443 --> 03:33.178
who went above and beyond
the call of duty this year.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.513
Here's to you Molly.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.784
Now, that being said,

03:38.852 --> 03:41.587
I wanted to find
some extra special way

03:41.655 --> 03:44.823
to say thank you
for all the good work.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.292
So,

03:47.361 --> 03:49.561
I'm closing down the office

03:49.630 --> 03:51.496
until the New Year.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.966
- What?
- You'll all receive

03:54.034 --> 03:56.001
full pay
for the two weeks, of course.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.135
- [laughs]

03:57.204 --> 03:58.136
- Yeah.

03:58.205 --> 04:01.440
- But, but, but, but, but,

04:01.508 --> 04:05.077
I don't wanna see anybody
coming into the office,

04:05.145 --> 04:06.612
and that goes
for you too, Molly.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.780
I mean it, I'm gonna change
the alarm codes

04:08.849 --> 04:10.048
so you can't sneak in.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.384
- [laughs]

04:12.453 --> 04:14.553
- But anyway...
- It's funny.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.589
- ...Look, just spend time
with your families

04:18.659 --> 04:20.492
and your friends,

04:20.560 --> 04:23.895
and celebrate
the holidays together.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.063
Merry Christmas everyone.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.498
- Merry Christmas.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.167
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

04:29.236 --> 04:32.170
- I guess this means
engagement is off.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.908
<i>[joyful music]</i>

04:44.218 --> 04:47.653
- Jared, just wanna
wish you a safe trip.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.355
Wish there was a better way
to handle this, but I'm...

04:50.424 --> 04:52.324
- Don't worry about it,
I understand.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.126
Didn't have any plans anyway.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.230
- Whatever happened to that
young lady you were seeing?

04:59.033 --> 05:00.532
- It didn't work out.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.434
- That's too bad.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.104
- Won't be
my first Christmas alone.

05:07.341 --> 05:10.042
- Yeah. Well, listen, Jared,
I'm sorry that, um...

05:10.110 --> 05:12.778
- I really should get going.

05:12.846 --> 05:13.945
And don't worry,

05:14.014 --> 05:15.414
I'll have this account
off the books

05:15.482 --> 05:17.249
by the end of the year.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.483
- Great.
Well, thank you,

05:18.552 --> 05:21.320
and Merry Christmas, Jared.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.422
- Merry Christmas, William.

- It's beautiful, huh?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.542
- Hmm?

05:43.610 --> 05:45.177
- The Christmas lights.

05:45.245 --> 05:47.079
They're beautiful, isn't it?

05:47.147 --> 05:48.647
- Oh, yeah.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.149
I hadn't really noticed.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.153
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

06:01.795 --> 06:03.362

06:10.904 --> 06:14.373
I know Christmas is a tough
time of year for you.

06:14.441 --> 06:17.809
So, why don't you
have Christmas with us?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.189
- Oh, Karen.
- You know, my mom and dad

06:19.213 --> 06:20.479
would love to have you.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.013
And you know,
Dave and I could use

06:22.082 --> 06:23.382
another grown up around.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.050
- You guys are the sweetest.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.719
I appreciate it, but I'm...

06:27.788 --> 06:29.588
- What?

06:29.656 --> 06:33.358
- I'm not very good company
at Christmas.

06:33.427 --> 06:34.993
- Okay.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.562
But if you change your mind,
will you let me know, please?

06:37.631 --> 06:38.663
- I will.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.732
Thank you.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.032
- Of course.

06:42.836 --> 06:43.869
Merry Christmas, Molly.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.003
- Merry Christmas.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.924
It sounds great.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.326
No, mom, I'm fine.

07:08.395 --> 07:11.296
Besides I have got
so much work to do,

07:11.365 --> 07:14.900
I'm not even gonna realize
it's Christmas.

- What a coincidence.
- Yes, it is.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.732

you won a contest, huh?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.067
Congratulations.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.036
I've overheard in line.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.806
- Oh, yes,
my first time to Jamaica,

11:14.875 --> 11:19.244
looking forward to having
my first authentic rum punch.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.549
Uh, are you,
uh, traveling for business?

11:24.618 --> 11:25.817
- Me? No. Uh,

11:25.886 --> 11:28.520
I'm... just needed
to get out of the city

11:28.588 --> 11:29.821
for the holidays.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.690
- Oh, I know the feeling.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.426
Christmas is so overwhelming.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.361
- Not for me.
I love it.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.430
- Oh, you do?

11:37.497 --> 11:38.596
- Oh, yeah.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.598
Yeah. I mean,

11:40.667 --> 11:42.267
snow,

11:42.335 --> 11:45.937
lights in the trees,
hot cocoa by the fire.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.850
- I don't get it.
If you like Christmas so much,

11:47.874 --> 11:50.542
why are you on your way
to the Caribbean?

11:50.610 --> 11:53.912
- I'm not on my way
to the Caribbean.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.113
- Oh?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.314
- No.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.217
This plane
is going to Vermont.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.518
- What?

12:12.966 --> 12:16.134
- I knew this plane
was too small.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.937
- Uh, is there a problem?

12:19.005 --> 12:20.772
- Yes.
I'm on the wrong plane.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.185
I'm supposed
to be going to Jamaica,

12:22.209 --> 12:23.209
the real Jamaica,

12:23.243 --> 12:24.542
with the sand
and the beach.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.611
- Uh, yeah.
Well, according to this,

12:26.680 --> 12:28.591
this flight was booked to the
other Jamaica in Vermont.

12:28.615 --> 12:29.881
So you're on the right plane.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.416
You're just going
to the wrong place.

12:31.485 --> 12:32.929
- Yes. I know that,
and I'm trying to get a hold

12:32.953 --> 12:34.953
at the radio station,
but I can't get online.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.122
- Oh, well,
we don't have internet access

12:37.190 --> 12:39.190
of some of these
smaller planes just yet.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.471
- Uh, I... could you tell the
pilot to turn the plane around,

12:41.495 --> 12:42.927
take me back to Chicago?

12:42.996 --> 12:45.363
- Oh, I don't think
the rest of the passengers

12:45.432 --> 12:47.632
would appreciate having
their Christmas travel plans

12:47.701 --> 12:48.900
rearranged like that.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.869
But I'm sure
as soon as we land,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.604
you'd be able to get it all
straighten up.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.038
- Well, how long
would that be?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.975
- Another two hours or so.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.943
And enjoy the flight.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.316
- You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

13:05.385 --> 13:06.818
- Oh, me? No.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.664
No. I was just reading
this really funny article

13:08.688 --> 13:10.789
about seatbelts.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.358
- You know, you could have
told me back at the airport.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.928
- I tried,
but you seemed pretty busy.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.097
- You know what, uh,

13:19.166 --> 13:20.726
how about we just not talk
to each other

13:20.767 --> 13:21.911
for the rest of our flight?
- Okay.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.067
- Okay?
- Fine.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.369
- Fine.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.006
- Something to drink?

13:28.074 --> 13:31.109
- You know, I'm kind of
craving, uh, a rum punch,

13:32.679 --> 13:35.113
pina colada.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.160
- What?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.863
Of course, I read the ticket.

13:51.932 --> 13:55.400
Well, I looked at it
and nowhere did it say Vermont.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.848
Well, someone at your radio
station's gonna have to fix this

13:58.872 --> 14:03.374
because I am not spending
my vacation in a snowstorm.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.576
What?

14:04.644 --> 14:06.444
Hello?

14:06.513 --> 14:07.645
Hello?

14:07.714 --> 14:08.847
Oh, great.

14:08.915 --> 14:11.182
That's just great.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.387
- Hope everything
works out for you.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.956
- I thought
we weren't talking?

14:18.024 --> 14:19.324
- Oh, right. Sorry.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.092
I forgot.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.460
Okay. Well, uh,

14:22.529 --> 14:25.964
this is me not wishing you
a Merry Christmas.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.132
- Me, too.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.640
Oh.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.354
Oh, come on.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.625
Damn it.
Where's my charger?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.460
Please don't say
I left it at home.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.629
- Oh, Ms. Clark?

14:57.697 --> 14:58.697
- Yes.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.599
- Well, you made it. Hi.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.869
Uh, I'm Chris, uh, the owner of
the Reindeer Lodge.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.671
Well, me and my wife are,

15:06.740 --> 15:09.474
uh, welcome to Jamaica.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.175
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.378
How did you know who I was?

15:13.446 --> 15:16.614
- Well, you're just
about the last person here,

15:16.683 --> 15:20.518
and, well, I just figured
that, uh... well,

15:20.587 --> 15:22.307
let me give you a hand...
- Oh, that's okay.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.454
Thank you. Um...

15:23.523 --> 15:25.089
I need to get a hold
of the airline.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.591
There's obviously been
a mistake.

15:26.660 --> 15:27.959
I'm not supposed to be here.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.629
- Oh, you're, uh,
Molly Clark, aren't you?

15:31.698 --> 15:32.897
- Yes, I am.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.265
But, um, I...
- You know, we have

15:34.334 --> 15:36.601
a beautiful suite
back at the inn,

15:36.670 --> 15:39.671
and it's all prepared
just for you.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.273
- I appreciate that.
Thank you.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.741
It's just, um...

15:43.810 --> 15:46.611
- Oh, looks like they're
closing down for the night.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.480
- Oh, airports don't close.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.583
- Well, this one does.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.688
It's a long walk back
into town from here.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.568
- You know what,
I could probably come with you

15:59.592 --> 16:01.292
and figure this out
in the morning.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.762
- Well, that's
the Christmas spirit.

16:04.831 --> 16:05.911
Here we go.
- Oh, thank you.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.031
- Just follow me.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.866
- Okay.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.441
- Yeah. Well, it's good
we're leaving now.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.510
There's supposed to be a big,
uh, snowstorm blowing in.

16:19.579 --> 16:23.214
We'll be lucky to get home
before they close the roads.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.782
Now, I hope you don't mind,

16:24.851 --> 16:28.486
uh, traveling
with an extra passenger.

16:28.555 --> 16:32.523
He's another one of our guests
for the holidays.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.460
- Oh, this can't be
a coincidence.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.631
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

16:51.411 --> 16:55.413
- Well, this is our Jamaica.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.848
- It's beautiful.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.683
- Yeah. Well, we like it.

16:58.752 --> 17:01.386
How about some music?

17:01.454 --> 17:03.821
<i>[Christmas music]</i>

17:03.890 --> 17:06.958
- Hmm, not much selection
this time of year.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.361
I hope you like
Christmas music.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.729
- I don't mind.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.931
Ms. Clark?

17:14.934 --> 17:16.267
- Why not?

17:20.173 --> 17:23.374
<i>[Christmas music]</i>

17:37.690 --> 17:39.257
- Sorry about the lights,
folks,

17:39.325 --> 17:42.493
I wanted everything finished
before you arrive,

17:42.562 --> 17:45.463
but, uh,
Christmas just, uh,

17:45.532 --> 17:47.432
came too quickly this year.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.568
- Oh, they still look amazing,
don't they?

17:50.637 --> 17:51.637
- Yeah.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.870
- The lights?

17:52.939 --> 17:54.272
- Yeah. No.
I just never gotten

17:54.340 --> 17:55.940
to the whole
Christmas decoration thing,

17:56.009 --> 17:57.586
you know, spend all that time
putting up the lights

17:57.610 --> 17:59.644
only to take them down
a few weeks later.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.045
- Okay.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.713
This way.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.216
- Oh, here.
Let me, uh...

18:06.986 --> 18:08.820
- All right, folks,

18:08.888 --> 18:10.788
come on in.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.459
Honey, we're here.

18:14.527 --> 18:18.129
- Well, hello,
welcome to Reindeer Lodge.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.764
- Molly and Jared,
this is my wife.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.365
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.733
Hey.
- Hello.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.169
- Hello.
Uh, Missis, uh...

18:25.238 --> 18:26.337
- Oh, no. Call me Penny.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.572
It's Christmas.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.018
There are no strangers
at Christmas.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.908
- All right, then.
Penny, it is.

18:30.977 --> 18:34.445
- Dear, you need warmer
clothes.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.147
- Oh, yes.
Well, I, uh,

18:36.216 --> 18:37.849
wasn't expecting it
to be winter.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.518
- Uh, there's seems
to have been some confusion

18:40.587 --> 18:42.253
about Molly's travel.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.454
- Oh, no.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.456
That radio station.
- Hmm, yeah.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.992
- Oh, I told those fellas
to be sure they mention

18:48.061 --> 18:50.128
it was in Vermont.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.330
Well, you're in
our Jamaica now.

18:52.398 --> 18:53.576
So let's just
get you settled in

18:53.600 --> 18:55.566
and we'll take it
from there.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.102
- Yeah.
- It might not be that bad.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.904
- Looks like
I don't have a choice, here.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.372
I'll get that, just...
- All right.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.441
- It's okay.
Thank you.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.915
- Just right this way.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.453
Jared, you'll be in here.

19:15.522 --> 19:18.956
And Molly,
you're just through here.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.125
- Hope you don't snore.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.564
- Okay. Here we go.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.667
I hope this room
is okay for you.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.637
- Yes.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.704
It's very festive.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.773
- It's my favorite.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.508
The bathroom
is right through there.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.244
If you need any more towels
or linens,

19:40.313 --> 19:42.280
just let me know.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.382
I like to sleep
with the window open a crack,

19:44.450 --> 19:46.751
but, you know, that's just me.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.053
Oh, and if you get cold,

19:49.122 --> 19:51.989
you can just slip
into one of these.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.958
I like to keep extras
for the guests.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.560
- Oh.
- Okay.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.062
So, if you think
of anything else you need,

19:58.131 --> 19:59.764
don't hesitate to ask.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.832
- Oh, is there, uh,
password for the internet?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.268
- No.
- Oh, great.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.304
- No. I mean,
there is no internet.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.738
- Huh?

20:07.807 --> 20:09.574
- Our guests seemed
to like it that way.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.275
It helps them relax.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.311
So just make yourself
comfortable

20:13.379 --> 20:15.146
and we'll see you
for happy hour.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.581
- Great.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.016
That's just great.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.226
- I... they're very nice people.

20:28.294 --> 20:32.029
I just wish there
was another way to...

20:32.098 --> 20:34.966
I understand, but they do have
until Christmas Eve.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.767
[knocks on door]

20:36.836 --> 20:38.769
- Uh, one second.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.238
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.872
Okay.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.849
Hi.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.351
- Hi.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.586
I don't suppose you have
a power chord for one of this.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.089
I think the airport
is trying to get a hold of me.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.691
- Sorry, not my brand.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.428
You could use mine, but
the reception's not very good.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.598
I don't think the Reindeer
Lodge is in the cell grid.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.811
- I don't think
the Reindeer Lodge

21:08.835 --> 21:11.335
is in the 21st Century either.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.937
[chuckles]

21:13.006 --> 21:16.941
- Uh, maybe I'll have them try
and call the hotel or something,

21:17.010 --> 21:19.010
and look, about earlier,

21:19.078 --> 21:21.779
I really didn't know

21:21.848 --> 21:23.547
that you didn't know...

21:23.616 --> 21:26.017
- That I was going
to the wrong Jamaica?

21:26.085 --> 21:27.085
[laughs]

21:27.153 --> 21:28.386
Yeah.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.222
I'm sorry too,
I didn't mean to be so rude.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.024
It wasn't your fault.

21:33.092 --> 21:36.794
I should've read
the fine print.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.496
- So what do you say?
We, uh...

21:38.564 --> 21:41.532
re-think the whole not talking
to each other thing,

21:41.601 --> 21:45.403
at least for the night?

21:45.471 --> 21:46.637
- Deal.

21:46.706 --> 21:47.638
- Deal.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.340
- Happy hour, come and get it.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.975
- Oh.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.243
Shall we?

21:52.312 --> 21:54.278
- Maybe you'll get
that rum punch after all.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.314
- [laughs]

21:58.017 --> 21:59.495
- So, we were in the woods this
afternoon for like an hour,

21:59.519 --> 22:00.818
but still no sign of them.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.727
- Yeah. They are going
to show up, aren't they?

22:02.755 --> 22:05.990
- Well, that's the thing
about reindeer.

22:06.059 --> 22:07.258
They're kind of shy.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.727
Now, they're accustomed
to me and my wife,

22:09.796 --> 22:13.564
but sometimes it takes
some a little time

22:13.633 --> 22:15.132
to get used to strangers.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.412
- That makes sense.
- Shy Reindeer?

22:16.436 --> 22:17.702
- That makes sense.

22:19.305 --> 22:20.771
- Oh, here they are.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.808
This is Molly, Jared,
this is, uh,

22:23.876 --> 22:25.142
it's Greg and Kayla.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.243
- Hi.

22:26.312 --> 22:27.489
- They're celebrating their...

22:27.513 --> 22:29.313
first wedding anniversary here.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.548
- Oh.

22:30.616 --> 22:31.616
Congratulations.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.917
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.952
- Wow, wonderful.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.498
What brought you
all the way out here?

22:36.522 --> 22:38.789
- Well, we are photographers.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.925
- Yeah. We're here,
uh, making our first book.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.871
It's gonna be Christmas prints
and we hope to include

22:42.895 --> 22:44.995
some actual reindeer
in their natural habitat.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.375
- Hmm, then we figured
what better place

22:46.399 --> 22:47.832
than the Reindeer Lodge.
- Uh-hmm.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.700
- Wait, you have
live reindeer here?

22:49.769 --> 22:52.002
- Yes. A registered
nature preserve.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.171
- All 1,000 acres.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.118
- So, do you think we'll see
some reindeer tomorrow?

22:56.142 --> 22:57.319
- Well, you never know exactly,

22:57.343 --> 22:59.410
but it's always worth a look.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.811
- Then look we will.

23:03.349 --> 23:06.517
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

23:10.123 --> 23:11.489
- Those are beautiful.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.257
Did you carve them yourself?

23:13.326 --> 23:15.359
- Oh, yes.
I got the wood shavings

23:15.428 --> 23:18.129
all over my carpet
to prove it.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.698
- Brought some happy hour
treats for everyone.

23:20.767 --> 23:21.899
- Oh.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.934
Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.536
- And one for you.

23:25.605 --> 23:29.440
- Oh, this is, um,
milk and cookies.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.710
- Oh, boy, that's my favorite.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.445
- I shouldn't give you any.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.680
- Why?
- My tree is still outside

23:36.749 --> 23:38.682
and Christmas Eve
is a week away.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.317
- Well, I'm gonna get to it.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.719
Don't worry.

23:41.788 --> 23:44.221
There's a lot of work here
at Christmas.

23:44.290 --> 23:47.625
- Sometimes our guests
like to help us decorate.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.593
- Do they?

23:49.662 --> 23:51.529
Well...

23:51.597 --> 23:53.464
[clears throat]

23:53.533 --> 23:57.067
To Christmas in Jamaica.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.705
- To Christmas in Jamaica.

24:11.584 --> 24:12.650
[knocks on door]

24:12.718 --> 24:13.784
- Molly?

24:13.853 --> 24:17.221
Are you up?

24:17.290 --> 24:19.924
- Uh, I am now.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.792
- There's a phone call for you,

24:21.861 --> 24:24.061
someone from the airline?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.797
- Oh, okay.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.844
- It's right
over there, dear.

24:43.216 --> 24:44.615
- Hi, this is Molly Clark.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.317
Very happy to hear from you.

24:46.385 --> 24:48.686
- Greg, why don't you read
our Christmas question

24:48.754 --> 24:51.188
for the day?
- All right. Absolutely.

24:53.793 --> 24:54.892
Ah.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.794
Uh, in the 12 days
of Christmas,

24:56.863 --> 24:59.930
how many pipers are piping?

25:01.501 --> 25:03.667
- Oh.

25:03.736 --> 25:06.737
- On the first day of Christmas
my true love gave to me...

25:06.806 --> 25:09.640
- Eleven days?

25:11.878 --> 25:14.812
What am I supposed to do
in the meantime?

25:16.616 --> 25:19.016
Merry Christmas to you, too.

25:20.586 --> 25:21.819
- Well,

25:21.888 --> 25:25.089
that's not
a very Merry Christmas face.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.568
- Well, every flight
they have is booked

25:26.592 --> 25:27.892
until the end of the week.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.627
I mean, they said
they will call me

25:29.695 --> 25:32.329
if there is a cancellation,
but it's highly unlikely,

25:32.398 --> 25:34.865
being the busiest
time of year.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.400
- Oh,

25:36.469 --> 25:38.235
tough break.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.904
- Well, not for us.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.740
The more the merrier
at Christmas.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.041
- Absolutely.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.843
- And look on the bright side,

25:45.912 --> 25:47.144
you guessed the right answer.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.213
- Hmm?

25:48.281 --> 25:49.914
- Pipers piping,

25:49.982 --> 25:51.882
11. You nailed it.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.718
- Yeah. You get to open
the advent calendar today.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.657
- Oh.

25:59.725 --> 26:00.891
- It's that one.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.693
- Okay. Hmm.

26:04.463 --> 26:06.864
- And don't forget to read
what's written inside.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.199
That's your Christmas message
for today.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.501
- Okay.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.542
Every Christmas is a journey.

26:18.611 --> 26:22.947
- And, uh, sometimes
the destination is a surprise.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.823
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

26:32.892 --> 26:36.060
[bell ringing]

26:47.073 --> 26:48.505
- Reindeer Lodge?

26:48.574 --> 26:50.385
Well, I haven't heard
about that place in years.

26:50.409 --> 26:53.243
I use to take my kids up
there when they were little.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.512
They had those reindeer tours.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.080
Do they still have
those tours?

26:56.148 --> 26:58.482
- Well, we haven't seen any
reindeer yet, but we'll see.

26:58.551 --> 27:00.028
- Oh, I don't think people
are really interested

27:00.052 --> 27:01.318
in that kind of thing anymore.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.487
Maybe if you had
a ninja reindeer robot,

27:03.556 --> 27:06.290
but, uh, oh,

27:06.359 --> 27:08.058
well, what about this?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.693
This is something very similar

27:09.762 --> 27:13.397
what Rosemary Clooney wore
in White Christmas.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.199
No? Okay.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.675
I designed this
for the mayor's wife.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.670
She wore it
in the last Christmas Parade,

27:19.739 --> 27:21.138
a great acclaim.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.940
- It's not really me.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.608
- Well.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.143
Here's something
you can't say no to.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.646
This is gonna get you
under the mistletoe.

27:28.714 --> 27:31.715
- Do you have anything just
a little less merry?

27:31.784 --> 27:32.784
- Less merry?

27:32.852 --> 27:34.284
Oh, wow, certainly.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.420
I can find you something
less merry.

27:36.489 --> 27:37.955
Be right back.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.423
- [giggles]

27:39.492 --> 27:41.525
Do you think Greg
will like this?

27:41.594 --> 27:43.105
- Well, you know,
what they traditionally say,

27:43.129 --> 27:45.396
reindeer is
the first anniversary gift.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.164
- Well, I hope so.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.000
It's been a rough year,
business has been slow,

27:50.069 --> 27:51.735
and I'm just hoping
to get everything

27:51.804 --> 27:54.138
right for us
this Christmas.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.606
Sorry that
you got stuck here,

27:55.675 --> 27:58.008
but it is
a cute little town.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.410
- Yeah, no,
it's not the town,

27:59.478 --> 28:02.012
it's just I usually
avoid Christmas

28:02.081 --> 28:04.415
and, you know,
well, here I am stuck

28:04.483 --> 28:06.583
right in the middle of it.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.419
- You don't like
Christmas?

28:08.487 --> 28:11.021
- It just brings up
some memories.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.656
- Good or bad?

28:12.725 --> 28:14.458
- A bit of both.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.393
- Well, here it is.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.163
Utilitarian
but understated.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.799
Less merry.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.808
- So, anybody special
back home?

28:30.876 --> 28:33.444
- Oh, I'm not
a relationship person.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.912
- That is ridiculous.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.925
I believe there's somebody
out there for everyone.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.483
- Why do married people
always say that to single...

28:39.552 --> 28:42.419
- Hi, honeybunch.
- There you are.

28:42.488 --> 28:43.654
- Hmm.

28:43.723 --> 28:45.367
You know, I got some
great shots for the book

28:45.391 --> 28:47.591
all we need now
are those reindeer photos.

28:47.660 --> 28:48.859
- Oh.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.172
- You really like reindeer,
don't you?

28:50.196 --> 28:51.962
- Oh, his grandmother

28:52.031 --> 28:53.197
always says
that a reindeer

28:53.265 --> 28:54.498
is the symbol
of true love.

28:54.567 --> 28:55.733
- It's actually
a Nordic myth.

28:55.801 --> 28:57.067
Grandma
is very old world.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.656
- Yeah, I know
it sounds a little weird

28:58.704 --> 29:01.071
but she always says that
when a couple first meets,

29:01.140 --> 29:02.539
if they go
into the wilderness

29:02.608 --> 29:04.875
under a full moon
and they see a reindeer...

29:04.944 --> 29:06.110
- It means
they are destined

29:06.178 --> 29:07.878
to be together.
- Forever.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.314
- You learn something
new every Christmas.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.382
- Yeah, my grandma
bought me my first camera.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.017
We wanna dedicate
this book to her

29:14.086 --> 29:15.597
so we got to have those
reindeer photos in there.

29:15.621 --> 29:18.489
- Why is it that
my husband is so sweet?

29:20.359 --> 29:21.925
- Well, it doesn't take
a reindeer

29:21.994 --> 29:25.295
to tell me you guys
are gonna be together forever.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.564
I'll catch up
with you guys, okay?

29:27.633 --> 29:29.099
- Look at that.
- Nice.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.378
- So, you don't think
I can get them, do you?

29:30.402 --> 29:31.642
- No, I know
you could get that.

29:31.704 --> 29:33.871
- You believe in me.
- I love it.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.042
- The Reindeer Lodge.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.978
I haven't thought
about that place in years.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.390
My parents used
to take me up there

29:42.414 --> 29:44.548
when I was a kid
to see the reindeer.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.216
But I didn't think
anybody even bother

29:46.285 --> 29:47.618
going up there anymore.

29:47.686 --> 29:49.586
- Yeah, well, we did.

29:49.655 --> 29:52.356
Anyway, I don't suppose
you have a...

29:52.424 --> 29:54.024
power cord
for one of these, do you?

29:54.093 --> 29:55.526
- Yup.
- Oh, great.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.494
- Well, I mean, I did.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.029
- Oh.
- Yeah.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.131
I just sold
the last one to... well,

30:01.200 --> 30:03.000
that fellow right there.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.268
- Ah.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.539
- I was gonna make you wait
until Christmas, but,

30:08.607 --> 30:11.542
I guess, you can have it.
- Thank you.

30:11.610 --> 30:14.111
At least let me
give you some money for it.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.180
- That's a gift.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.547
It's Christmas.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.149
- Okay, then,
let me get you something.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.984
- Nah.
- Oh, come on.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.320
- You got to find something
in here interesting.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.325
This is beautiful.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.194
- Well, those are
actually one of a kind.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.029
Handmade right here
in Jamaica.

30:32.097 --> 30:34.898
- My dad got me
something like this.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.101
- You know what?

30:38.170 --> 30:40.070
- Sorry, what?

30:40.139 --> 30:41.872
- You wanna give me a gift?

30:41.941 --> 30:43.141
There's a place
down the street

30:43.209 --> 30:44.252
that sells
Vermont's version

30:44.276 --> 30:46.476
of a Jamaican rum punch.

30:46.545 --> 30:47.811
You wanna try it?

30:53.319 --> 30:54.518
- Why not?

30:59.992 --> 31:01.336
- Here you go.
- This is what I did.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.194
- Two hot buttered rums.
- Thank you.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.630
Okay, so this is
Vermont's version

31:06.699 --> 31:08.699
of the Jamaican
rum punch.

31:08.767 --> 31:09.967
- Okay.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.508
It's really good.
- Would I steer you wrong?

31:18.577 --> 31:20.310
- Well, we are in Vermont.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.612
- Okay.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.350
So, tell me
about your reindeer.

31:26.418 --> 31:29.219
- Well...

31:29.288 --> 31:30.754
when I was growing up,

31:30.823 --> 31:32.189
we didn't have
much money

31:32.258 --> 31:35.692
so I used to make
my own decorations.

31:35.761 --> 31:38.395
- Let me guess,
a toilet paper roll angels?

31:38.464 --> 31:39.464
- Exactly.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.732
- Marshmallow snowman?

31:41.800 --> 31:42.933
- Those too.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.302
But, uh, I can never make
a reindeer

31:45.371 --> 31:47.204
because I could
never get the antlers

31:47.273 --> 31:48.338
and the legs right.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.773
- They're complicated
animals.

31:49.842 --> 31:51.253
- They're very complicated.
- Uh-hmm.

31:51.277 --> 31:55.178
- Anyway, on Christmas Eve

31:55.247 --> 31:57.047
when I was eight years old,

31:57.116 --> 32:00.484
my dad was on his way home
from work

32:00.552 --> 32:03.587
and he got stuck
in a snow storm,

32:05.190 --> 32:07.925
and then it was just me
and my mom.

32:09.561 --> 32:12.229
- I'm so sorry.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.264
- Yeah.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.099
But that morning,

32:16.168 --> 32:18.068
there was a little gift
under the tree for me,

32:18.137 --> 32:21.505
and my mom said that my dad
had left it for me.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.807
So, I opened it

32:23.876 --> 32:26.410
and he had carved me
this, like,

32:26.478 --> 32:29.246
perfect little reindeer.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.748
It was really sweet.

32:31.817 --> 32:34.518
I wish I knew
where it was now.

32:38.824 --> 32:41.158
- Christmas
is complicated, huh?

32:41.226 --> 32:44.428
- Yeah, Christmas
is complicated.

32:44.496 --> 32:45.796
- So, what about your mom?

32:45.864 --> 32:47.397
You don't spend
Christmas with her?

32:47.466 --> 32:50.233
- No, she moved to Florida
with her new husband.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.169
He's very lovely and...
- Hmm.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.437
-...They're happy but...

32:53.505 --> 32:55.672
she has a new life
and a new family.

32:55.741 --> 32:59.176
And I mean, they try
to make me feel welcome but...

32:59.244 --> 33:02.813
I don't know,
I just don't fit in anymore.

33:02.881 --> 33:05.115
What about your family?

33:05.184 --> 33:06.950
- Oh, it was just me
and my dad,

33:07.019 --> 33:08.585
not that close.

33:08.654 --> 33:09.786
- Well, that's sad.

33:09.855 --> 33:12.556
Is that why you spend
Christmas alone?

33:13.726 --> 33:15.392
- Not exactly.

33:17.096 --> 33:20.731
It's just one
of those things, you know.

33:24.937 --> 33:26.003
I have an idea.

33:26.071 --> 33:28.105
Come with me.
- Hmm?

33:31.443 --> 33:32.743
- Come on.

33:36.882 --> 33:40.650
To the Reindeer Lodge,
good sir.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.219
This is happening.

33:42.287 --> 33:44.187
Oh, we're doing it.

34:18.757 --> 34:19.956
- Sorry, we're late guys.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.692
- No, no, no,
you're right on time.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.764
- Okay.

34:28.833 --> 34:29.966
- Oh, wait,
hold up, hold up.

34:30.034 --> 34:32.002
I got to get that.

34:32.071 --> 34:33.437
All right.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.571
Oh, there we go.

34:34.639 --> 34:35.871
Perfect.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.745
- Here you are.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.713
Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.820
- So...

34:49.888 --> 34:51.955
- Um...

34:52.024 --> 34:53.556
- Wait, wait.

34:53.625 --> 34:54.658
Don't turn them on.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.693
I've got the cocoa.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.763
- Grab some cocoa, guys.
- Thank you.

34:59.832 --> 35:03.433
- We have a tradition here
at Reindeer Lodge.

35:03.502 --> 35:07.504
Every year, we always toast
to Christmas lights.

35:07.573 --> 35:10.107
- Oh.
- All right.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.242
Everybody ready.

35:13.145 --> 35:16.446
Let's just hope
I did this right.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.982
All right, here we go.

35:19.051 --> 35:20.117
Yeah.

35:20.185 --> 35:22.419
- Hey, hey, hey.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.688
- To Christmas.

35:29.828 --> 35:30.828
- To Christmas.

35:30.863 --> 35:33.263
- To Christmas.
- Oh.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.834
- It's beautiful, darling.
- Beautiful.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.152
- Oh, I love them.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:44.176 --> 35:46.610
Definitely going in the book.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.678
Look, that one came out perfect.
- Yes.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.847
- I told you.
- Yes.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.182
- So...

35:54.586 --> 35:57.521
did that change your mind
about Christmas lights?

35:58.757 --> 36:00.423
- What do you mean?

36:02.127 --> 36:04.694
- You still think
it's not worth the trouble?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.565
- I will let you know.

37:06.692 --> 37:07.692
-<i> Jared?</i>

37:07.759 --> 37:09.025
-<i> Hi.</i>

37:10.929 --> 37:12.829
- Everything all right?

37:12.898 --> 37:14.631
- Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.099
It's just...

37:16.168 --> 37:18.034
- How are things
working out up there?

37:18.103 --> 37:19.669
Any problems?

37:19.738 --> 37:20.738
-<i> No.</i>

37:20.772 --> 37:24.574
No, well, not really.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.910
It's just this place, it's...

37:26.979 --> 37:29.579
I mean, it's not just
a piece of property, you know.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.215
-<i> I understand that.</i>

37:32.284 --> 37:34.784
<i>These things
can be a bit tricky.</i>

37:34.853 --> 37:35.885
- Yeah.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.721
Well...

37:37.789 --> 37:40.757
and I've also
got myself into a...

37:40.826 --> 37:43.927
<i>bit of a situation here.</i>

37:43.996 --> 37:47.063
- What type of situation?

37:59.745 --> 38:01.011
- Hi.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.178
- Good morning.

38:02.247 --> 38:03.313
- Wow.

38:03.382 --> 38:06.149
You sure are up
early this morning.

38:06.218 --> 38:08.551
- Yeah, well,
the wife...

38:08.620 --> 38:10.553
gets tired of picking up
these wood chips,

38:10.622 --> 38:13.590
so I had been banished
to the great outdoors.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.158
- Any sign
of those reindeer yet?

38:15.227 --> 38:18.528
- Well, nothing yet,
but you never know.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.697
They have a habit
of making an appearance

38:20.766 --> 38:24.000
when you least
expect them.

38:27.139 --> 38:29.639
- Do you think you could...

38:29.708 --> 38:31.741
show me how to do that?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.209
- Sure.

38:33.278 --> 38:36.646
Give it a try.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.749
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

38:39.818 --> 38:41.129
- Well, please let me know
if you have

38:41.153 --> 38:43.653
another cancellation.

38:43.722 --> 38:46.690
Okay, yes,
Merry Christmas to you too.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.025
Oh, let me help you.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.593
- Yeah.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.331
- So, no luck
with the airline?

38:54.399 --> 38:55.765
- Still no cancellations.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.435
They're fully booked
until the New Year.

38:58.503 --> 39:00.670
- Oh, I'm sorry.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.373
We sure have enjoyed
having you here.

39:03.442 --> 39:05.675
- Thank you, Penny,
I'm sorry.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.678
I am having a nice time,
it's just...

39:08.747 --> 39:11.247
this isn't how I expected
to spend my Christmas.

39:11.316 --> 39:13.650
- Well,
you can't plan everything.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.018
Sometimes
the best things in life

39:15.087 --> 39:17.587
are the things
we weren't expecting at all.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.361
Help me decorate?

39:24.429 --> 39:26.696
- Oh, I haven't done
this in a long time.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.833
- It's like riding a bike,
you never really forget.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.968
- I'll give it a try.

39:34.039 --> 39:37.273
- You know, life is a lot
like Christmas.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.976
- Oh, yeah, how so?

39:40.045 --> 39:41.311
- Well, think about it.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.812
We have
all these traditions,

39:42.881 --> 39:43.913
the Christmas lights,

39:43.982 --> 39:46.015
the music, the baking.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.184
And every once in a while,

39:48.253 --> 39:50.820
something comes along

39:50.889 --> 39:52.989
that surprises us,
and who knows,

39:53.058 --> 39:54.858
if it fits,
it could end up becoming

39:54.926 --> 39:56.760
a Christmas tradition, too.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.598
You know, Jared
has been helping Chris

40:01.666 --> 40:02.832
all day out there.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.635
I bet he's worked up
quite an appetite.

40:06.671 --> 40:10.507
- Well, what do you
think of this?

40:12.944 --> 40:14.544
- I think he'll love it.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.326
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:30.395 --> 40:31.672
So, what do you think,
we got enough

40:31.696 --> 40:33.062
to make it
through Christmas?

40:33.131 --> 40:34.242
- I think we got enough
to get it through

40:34.266 --> 40:36.366
until next Christmas.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.301
Here.
- What's this?

40:38.370 --> 40:41.471
- Something to keep
your strength up.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.406
- Wait, did you make this?

40:43.475 --> 40:45.675
- Well, I helped.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.144
- This is delicious.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.679
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.014
- Okay.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.817
- For somebody who claims
to not like Christmas,

40:53.885 --> 40:55.485
you sure make
a mean gingerbread man.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.154
- Yeah, well,
spending my holidays

40:58.223 --> 40:59.856
at a place
called The Reindeer Lodge,

40:59.925 --> 41:01.858
I figured I'd
sink or swim.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.259
- Uh-hmm.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.108
- I better get back
to the kitchen.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.299
Penny is a baking machine.

41:09.367 --> 41:10.433
- Molly?
- Yeah?

41:10.502 --> 41:12.101
- Um...

41:14.105 --> 41:16.539
no, just thanks for the cookie.
- Yeah.

41:18.443 --> 41:20.510
- Hey, guys,
get closer together.

41:20.579 --> 41:21.778
- Oh.

41:23.381 --> 41:24.581
- Go.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.817
- Perfect.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.931
- We're going to the woods
to look for some reindeer,

41:29.955 --> 41:32.555
if you wanna come.
- Come on.

41:32.624 --> 41:33.756
- Folks.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.926
Folks.

41:36.995 --> 41:40.296
I'm sorry,
I got some bad news, but...

41:41.500 --> 41:44.033
we have reindeer problems.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.237
- What?

41:55.981 --> 41:57.914
- So, the reindeer is sick?

41:57.983 --> 41:59.782
- Oh, I know, it's rare

41:59.851 --> 42:02.252
but it does happen.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.154
And reindeer
are very sensitive animals

42:05.223 --> 42:09.292
so I think it's best
if I keep them quarantined

42:09.361 --> 42:10.760
for their own protection.

42:10.829 --> 42:14.063
- But we can take
one little picture, right?

42:14.132 --> 42:15.198
- Well, no.

42:15.267 --> 42:16.866
I'm sorry,

42:16.935 --> 42:19.102
I just can't risk it

42:19.170 --> 42:21.070
and I'm not even sure
you're gonna be able

42:21.139 --> 42:23.840
to see the reindeer
before you leave.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.109
- But that was the whole point

42:25.143 --> 42:26.309
of us coming up here.
- Yeah.

42:26.378 --> 42:27.911
- We base
the entire book on this.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.013
- I understand and...

42:30.081 --> 42:32.148
I'm sorry, and I really am.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.249
- Maybe we could give you

42:33.318 --> 42:34.517
some sort of a refund?

42:34.586 --> 42:36.052
- Yeah.

42:36.121 --> 42:37.899
- That's really sweet,
but it's not your fault.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.255
- Of course, not, it just...

42:39.324 --> 42:42.191
It just means we have
to rethink things, is all.

42:42.260 --> 42:44.460
- We'll figure something out.
- Yeah.

42:47.632 --> 42:49.933
- Molly, it is your turn

42:50.001 --> 42:52.302
to ask the Christmas question.

42:53.171 --> 42:54.404
- Okay.

42:57.042 --> 42:59.342
"What does Santa Claus
put in the stocking

42:59.411 --> 43:01.244
of those who have been
naughty?"

43:01.313 --> 43:02.946
- Coal.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.213
- That's right.

43:04.282 --> 43:05.648
Here you go.

43:15.026 --> 43:17.994
- A Christmas surprise
will come your way.

43:18.063 --> 43:19.762
- It already has.

43:24.536 --> 43:26.235
- All right.

43:26.304 --> 43:29.772
Let's get back some
of that Christmas cheer, guys.

43:29.841 --> 43:32.875
- Yeah, why don't we put up
that tree, after all?

43:32.944 --> 43:35.178
- That's a wonderful idea.

43:35.246 --> 43:37.046
- That is a great idea.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.648
Chris, where is it?

43:38.717 --> 43:41.050
- It's outside leaning
against the railing.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.119
- Which railing?

43:42.187 --> 43:44.153
- Next to the back door.

43:46.558 --> 43:48.157
- Not anymore.

43:51.162 --> 43:52.629
- Oh.

43:53.465 --> 43:54.575
- I can't believe
you actually

43:54.599 --> 43:55.999
chopped up
the Christmas tree.

43:56.067 --> 43:57.400
- How was I supposed
to know?

43:57.469 --> 43:59.068
A tree is a tree, right?

43:59.137 --> 44:00.548
- Not when it's laying up
against the house

44:00.572 --> 44:02.205
looking all Christmassy, man.

44:02.273 --> 44:05.642
- Guys, we just got
to find a pine tree.

44:05.710 --> 44:07.043
- Yeah, how hard can it be?

44:07.112 --> 44:08.978
The woods are full
of them, right?

44:09.047 --> 44:10.413
- Okay, what do you say

44:10.482 --> 44:12.782
we split off into groups?

44:12.851 --> 44:16.285
First group to find
a suitable tree, call out,

44:16.354 --> 44:18.621
we all come together,
cut it down,

44:18.690 --> 44:20.390
drag it back to the house.

44:20.458 --> 44:21.658
- Cool.
- We got that.

44:21.726 --> 44:23.259
- Okay.
- And I won't burn it.

44:23.328 --> 44:24.961
- Let's go.

44:25.030 --> 44:27.263
- Still rather
be taking pictures of reindeer.

44:27.332 --> 44:28.564
- Oh, come on.

44:33.972 --> 44:35.938
- So, you never did tell me

44:36.007 --> 44:38.207
what you do for a living.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.509
- I work in finance.

44:39.577 --> 44:40.577
- Oh.

44:40.645 --> 44:43.680
What kind of finance?

44:43.748 --> 44:45.248
- Real estate.

44:45.316 --> 44:47.316
Properties mostly.

44:47.385 --> 44:50.787
Actually,
I work for my father.

44:50.855 --> 44:51.954
- Wait,
I thought you said

44:52.023 --> 44:53.156
you didn't see
your father?

44:53.224 --> 44:56.192
- No, no, I said
we weren't close.

44:56.261 --> 44:58.227
I see him every day.

44:58.296 --> 45:01.931
- Well, do you think that's why
you guys aren't close

45:02.000 --> 45:04.167
because you see
each other all the time?

45:04.235 --> 45:06.002
- It started before that.

45:06.071 --> 45:07.603
I was one of those
boarding school kids

45:07.672 --> 45:09.706
who barely came home.

45:09.774 --> 45:11.140
- Even at Christmas?

45:11.209 --> 45:12.620
- Well, I have
my own tree in my room

45:12.644 --> 45:14.811
and my dad
would send me money for gifts.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.245
I'd buy them for myself,

45:16.314 --> 45:17.525
and then I'd wrap them up,
put them under the tree,

45:17.549 --> 45:19.048
and then on Christmas day,

45:19.117 --> 45:20.628
I'd open them up
and pretend to be surprised.

45:20.652 --> 45:22.351
But, I mean, not every year.

45:22.420 --> 45:23.698
- Jared,
that is the saddest thing

45:23.722 --> 45:25.588
I've ever heard.

45:25.657 --> 45:29.192
- Actually... I don't know,
I, kind of, liked being alone.

45:29.260 --> 45:32.261
Boarding school
can be pretty noisy.

45:32.330 --> 45:36.232
Maybe that's why this is
my favorite time of year.

45:36.301 --> 45:38.234
Sometimes at Christmas,
it sounds like

45:38.303 --> 45:40.369
the whole world
is taking a rest.

45:40.438 --> 45:41.704
Listen.

45:50.081 --> 45:52.615
- Do you always spend
Christmas alone?

45:52.684 --> 45:55.118
- Not always.

45:55.186 --> 45:56.452
There have been a few,

45:56.521 --> 45:59.589
but this one's the first one
that I thought

45:59.657 --> 46:01.190
I was definitely
going to be alone.

46:01.259 --> 46:02.759
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

46:02.827 --> 46:04.961
- And I'm not.

46:07.465 --> 46:09.632
- Well, Penny says

46:09.701 --> 46:13.002
that sometimes
the best things in life

46:13.071 --> 46:15.838
are the ones that
we aren't expecting at all.

46:17.742 --> 46:20.276
- This Christmas
is full of surprises.

46:20.345 --> 46:22.478
- Uh-hmm.

46:22.547 --> 46:24.614
Whoa.
- Oh.

46:28.319 --> 46:29.952
Hmm.

46:30.021 --> 46:32.455
Is this the right time
to let you know that...

46:32.524 --> 46:35.591
I'm glad you got
on the wrong plane?

46:35.660 --> 46:37.960
- Molly, Jared.

46:39.364 --> 46:42.098
- On our way.

46:42.167 --> 46:43.167
- Okay.

46:43.234 --> 46:44.234
- All right.
- Come here.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.369
- All right, yup.

46:54.712 --> 46:57.013
- I guess Greg
found the stables.

47:02.220 --> 47:03.653
- What're you doing?

47:05.089 --> 47:06.956
Hey, Chris said
the reindeer are sensitive.

47:07.025 --> 47:08.369
Stop...
- I'm not gonna bother them,

47:08.393 --> 47:10.393
I just need
to get one picture.

47:12.931 --> 47:14.297
- Hey, come on, man.

47:14.365 --> 47:16.143
Leave the reindeer alone,
let's go find a tree.

47:16.167 --> 47:19.135
- Hold on, hold on,
I can almost see it.

47:19.204 --> 47:20.903
Wait a minute.

47:22.507 --> 47:25.308
- What is it?

47:25.376 --> 47:26.876
- Greg.

47:33.351 --> 47:34.351
- Nothing.

47:34.419 --> 47:36.085
Absolutely nothing.

47:37.789 --> 47:40.189
- I don't see any reindeer.

47:40.258 --> 47:41.258
- Yeah.

47:41.292 --> 47:44.160
- Because there aren't any.

47:44.229 --> 47:48.030
The Reindeer Lodge
that has no reindeer.

47:49.133 --> 47:52.668
Truth is, we don't know
what happened.

47:52.737 --> 47:56.172
Whether it was a change
in the migration patterns

47:56.241 --> 47:59.609
or a change in the weather

47:59.677 --> 48:00.677
whatever it was,

48:00.745 --> 48:03.379
one day they just wandered off

48:03.448 --> 48:05.514
and never came back.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.316
- Didn't you try
and look for them?

48:07.385 --> 48:11.254
- No because this is
a nature preserve, not a zoo.

48:11.322 --> 48:13.322
- What's the difference?

48:13.391 --> 48:15.258
- Well, the difference is that

48:15.326 --> 48:17.593
we don't own these animals.

48:17.662 --> 48:21.330
They're free to come and go
as they choose.

48:21.399 --> 48:22.999
- So, they left?

48:23.067 --> 48:24.067
- But why the big secret?

48:24.135 --> 48:25.279
Why not just tell us the truth

48:25.303 --> 48:27.837
from the beginning?

48:27.906 --> 48:29.171
- Would you have come
to a place

48:29.240 --> 48:31.307
called The Reindeer Lodge

48:31.376 --> 48:34.877
if you weren't gonna see
any reindeer?

48:34.946 --> 48:38.714
The reindeer tours
pay our bills.

48:38.783 --> 48:40.917
Things have been
a little rough this year.

48:40.985 --> 48:44.854
I don't mind telling you...

48:44.923 --> 48:48.190
Look, I apologize...

48:48.259 --> 48:49.525
to all of you

48:49.594 --> 48:52.728
for not being upfront
about all this.

48:52.797 --> 48:56.165
I hope you know
we didn't mean you any harm.

48:56.234 --> 48:59.235
I... we really thought
they were gonna come back.

48:59.304 --> 49:00.536
I mean, we really did.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.905
They usually do.

49:02.974 --> 49:04.907
Anyway...

49:06.244 --> 49:10.112
I better go get that tree
for Penny.

49:12.650 --> 49:13.950
- I'll help.

49:15.486 --> 49:17.420
- So much for our book.

49:17.488 --> 49:18.688
- Greg.

49:28.466 --> 49:31.634
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

49:39.010 --> 49:40.042
- Hey, Penny.

49:40.111 --> 49:41.510
- Oh, hello, dear.

49:41.579 --> 49:42.778
Can I get you anything?

49:42.847 --> 49:44.080
- No, I just wanted to see

49:44.148 --> 49:45.881
if you needed any help
with the baking.

49:45.950 --> 49:48.351
- Oh, no, thanks.

49:48.419 --> 49:51.754
I'm, uh,
I'm all cookied out.

49:51.823 --> 49:54.290
- Did Chris tell you?

49:54.359 --> 49:57.326
Penny, we're not gonna say
anything to anyone.

49:57.395 --> 49:58.728
- Oh, you're very sweet, dear.

49:58.796 --> 50:02.164
But it's not just about that.

50:02.233 --> 50:05.534
And I got some bad news
in the mail today.

50:05.603 --> 50:07.236
I guess, we've fallen
a bit behind

50:07.305 --> 50:09.772
on the bills and things.

50:10.875 --> 50:13.342
- Will it help
when the reindeer come back?

50:15.613 --> 50:18.347
- Afraid that really
won't make much difference.

50:19.150 --> 50:20.416
People aren't too interested

50:20.485 --> 50:23.519
in our reindeer tours
these days.

50:23.588 --> 50:25.988
Sign of the times, I guess.

50:26.057 --> 50:27.289
Why come all the way up here

50:27.358 --> 50:28.635
to see a real reindeer
when you can

50:28.659 --> 50:31.761
just watch them on your phone.

50:31.829 --> 50:33.896
I really thought
the radio contest might help,

50:33.965 --> 50:36.832
but all that did
was bring you somewhere

50:36.901 --> 50:40.002
you never really wanted
to be in the first place.

50:43.608 --> 50:46.876
- Hey, you're not gonna lose
your home, are you?

50:46.944 --> 50:49.378
- Well, home is just
a place, dear.

50:49.447 --> 50:51.514
The heart can travel.

50:52.483 --> 50:55.017
I do worry
about Chris though.

50:55.086 --> 50:56.786
He loves this place so.

50:56.854 --> 50:58.988
Anyway...

50:59.057 --> 51:01.557
you do not need
to worry about us.

51:01.626 --> 51:03.726
We will be fine.

51:03.795 --> 51:05.061
It's Christmas.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.768
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

51:27.018 --> 51:28.517
- Okay, tighten her up

51:28.586 --> 51:30.019
and I think we got it.

51:32.490 --> 51:35.558
- Uh-huh and perfect.

51:36.527 --> 51:37.771
It looks pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.

51:37.795 --> 51:39.895
- It looks great.
- Yeah.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.366
- What's up?

51:44.435 --> 51:45.612
- It's just that's
about the last tree

51:45.636 --> 51:47.736
they get to see
in this house.

51:47.805 --> 51:49.338
The company
that owns the mortgage

51:49.407 --> 51:50.739
on this place
is gonna foreclose.

51:50.808 --> 51:51.907
- Oh, no.

51:51.976 --> 51:53.020
- If they don't come up
with the money

51:53.044 --> 51:54.977
before Christmas Eve,

51:55.046 --> 51:57.346
they're gonna lose
Reindeer Lodge.

51:57.415 --> 52:00.249
Surely there's something
that we can do.

52:01.519 --> 52:03.519
Hey, Kayla,
what's wrong?

52:03.588 --> 52:04.653
- Everything.

52:04.722 --> 52:05.921
- Okay.

52:17.702 --> 52:20.002
Hey...

52:20.071 --> 52:22.071
anything I can do?

52:29.113 --> 52:31.480
- I really thought
the two of us coming up here

52:31.549 --> 52:33.415
will be a good thing,
you know.

52:33.484 --> 52:36.385
After the year we had,

52:36.454 --> 52:38.087
he just really want
his book to work out,

52:38.156 --> 52:40.322
but he's feeling
like a failure.

52:40.391 --> 52:43.325
And we just had
a really big fight.

52:45.429 --> 52:46.896
- You know,
I'm not really an expert

52:46.964 --> 52:49.798
at this sort of thing

52:49.867 --> 52:51.600
but...

52:51.669 --> 52:53.969
I've watched you guys together,

52:54.038 --> 52:56.539
you're crazy
about each other.

52:56.607 --> 52:59.208
Do you know
how rare that is?

52:59.277 --> 53:00.609
People go their whole lives

53:00.678 --> 53:02.811
looking for what
you guys have.

53:05.449 --> 53:06.969
I know you've only been
married a year,

53:07.018 --> 53:10.386
but, uh, it's not
like Christmas lights.

53:10.454 --> 53:12.855
Put all that work in
for a few weeks to twinkle

53:12.924 --> 53:16.058
just to shut it down
January 1st.

53:16.127 --> 53:18.694
You guys are in this
for the long run.

53:19.730 --> 53:23.199
What you guys have got
is special.

53:23.267 --> 53:25.301
You need to treasure it.

If I ever find
what you and Greg have,

53:30.908 --> 53:32.541
I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

53:32.610 --> 53:34.109
doing everything
in my power

to keep those lights on.

our Christmas treasures.

from someone

Oh, this one
is from the Carters,

54:17.688 --> 54:18.954
they had two small children

54:19.023 --> 54:21.023
and a great big dog
who used to come in

54:21.092 --> 54:24.393
from the snow and shake
all over the carpet.

54:24.462 --> 54:25.594
- May I help?

54:25.663 --> 54:29.231
- Oh, I would love
for you to.

54:29.300 --> 54:30.633
- What about this one?

54:30.701 --> 54:33.569
- Oh, that's
from the Marshall family.

54:33.638 --> 54:35.537
Mr. Marshall
was a cellist

54:35.606 --> 54:37.573
and he played
the most beautiful music

54:37.642 --> 54:40.109
in this room
on Christmas Eve.

Mrs. Worthington.

54:46.284 --> 54:47.583
She brought
her young daughter

who recited

54:49.520 --> 54:51.020
"The Night Before Christmas"

in front of that fireplace,
doing all by heart.

just go grab one you like.

could do for Chris and Penny.

But business
is business, right?

- No, it's not just
a business, Jared.

I like looking at you
when you talk like this.

57:08.592 --> 57:10.793
- Like what?

57:10.861 --> 57:12.861

to see you

- Well, the reindeer?

- That too.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.445
Oh, I have an idea.

57:29.513 --> 57:32.748
- Uh-hmm, what is it?
- Can you cook?

57:35.686 --> 57:37.085
- Kinda.

57:47.832 --> 57:50.199
- Can you read
Penny's writing?

57:50.267 --> 57:51.500
- Uh, let's see.

57:51.569 --> 57:52.835
Either cranberries

57:52.903 --> 57:54.470
or Ecuador... I'd go
with cranberries.

57:54.538 --> 57:57.673
Have you ever made one of
these Christmas dinners before?

57:57.741 --> 57:59.741
- No, but I just feel like,

everybody could use
the break right now.

58:01.479 --> 58:03.912
- Uh-hmm.
- Especially Penny, you know.

58:03.981 --> 58:05.514

everyone does this.

58:07.451 --> 58:08.984
How hard could it be?

- You're really getting into
this whole Christmas thing, huh?

58:14.692 --> 58:17.159
- Reindeer Lodge, is that place
still in business?

58:17.228 --> 58:18.827
- Yeah, it sure is.

58:18.896 --> 58:21.263
- Let me guess,
it was a family tradition.

58:21.332 --> 58:22.932
- I haven't been there
since I was a kid.

58:22.967 --> 58:25.367
But I remember
we used to go every year.

58:25.436 --> 58:28.604
I mean, where else
can you find reindeer?

58:28.672 --> 58:31.039
- Yeah, where else?

58:31.108 --> 58:32.374
- Where else?

58:41.485 --> 58:43.352
- Canada.
- Really?

58:43.420 --> 58:45.053
- Northern Quebec
to be exact.

58:45.122 --> 58:46.562
There is a reindeer
preserve up there

58:46.624 --> 58:49.691
that has
an overpopulation problem.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.994
- You're really considering
contacting these people.

58:52.062 --> 58:53.362
- Oh, I already did.

58:53.430 --> 58:54.430
They know the situation

58:54.465 --> 58:56.164
and they're willing to help us.

58:58.836 --> 59:00.769
- Okay, beyond
everything else though,

59:00.838 --> 59:02.137
have you considered
how expensive

59:02.206 --> 59:03.505
something like this
is gonna be?

59:03.574 --> 59:05.107
You're talking
about relocating

59:05.175 --> 59:06.842
an entire herd
of reindeer.

59:06.911 --> 59:07.976
- I know.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.478
We're gonna need
some help.

59:15.786 --> 59:18.053
- Oh, boy,
that smells wonderful.

59:18.122 --> 59:19.955
- Oh, looks delicious.

59:20.024 --> 59:21.823
- I don't think we've ever had

59:21.892 --> 59:24.226
our guests make
their own Christmas dinner.

59:26.263 --> 59:27.329
- Oh, gosh, Molly.

59:27.398 --> 59:28.630
I don't know.

59:28.699 --> 59:30.532
Northern Quebec
is a long way away.

59:30.601 --> 59:32.000
- Yeah.
Even if we could afford it,

59:32.069 --> 59:33.513
I don't think Santa Claus
himself could deliver

59:33.537 --> 59:35.270
a herd of reindeer
by Christmas Eve.

59:35.339 --> 59:37.806
- No. But I think
that if the people in town

59:37.875 --> 59:39.641
knew what was happening,

59:39.710 --> 59:41.977
they would wanna help
save Reindeer Lodge.

59:42.046 --> 59:44.212
- Molly's right,
you know, and your lodge

59:44.281 --> 59:45.401
is a tradition in this town.

59:45.449 --> 59:47.082
We just need to remind people

59:47.151 --> 59:49.084
how important it is.

59:50.588 --> 59:53.221
- What if we have
some sort of fundraising?

59:53.290 --> 59:54.656
- Hmm, like an auction.

59:54.725 --> 59:56.925
- That's a good idea.
- It is a good idea,

59:56.994 --> 59:59.828
but there's just one problem.

59:59.897 --> 01:00:02.197
We don't have anything
to auction off.

01:00:05.536 --> 01:00:08.036
- Actually, we do.

01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:02.751
Can you help me find
the Reindeer Lodge?

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:13.295
- We used to use this

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:14.363
to play music

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:15.564
for the reindeer at night.

01:02:15.632 --> 01:02:17.265
Thought it might come in handy

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.501
for the party.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.103
- Used to play
the reindeer music?

01:02:21.171 --> 01:02:22.171
- Oh, yeah.

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:23.271
They were very partial

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.440
with this one.

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:26.808
- Chris?

01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:29.010
Chris, I need you
up here, please.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:30.245
- Excuse me.

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:33.014
Duty calls,
I'll be right back.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:39.321
- Hey, Jared.
- Yeah.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:43.225
- Do you think
this is gonna work?

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:44.593
- I don't know.

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:47.295
But I do know
that we've done our best.

- Oh, okay.

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:04.412
- You heard anything
from the airline?

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.714
- You know what's funny?

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.582
I have lost all desire

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:10.652
to travel
this holiday season.

01:03:10.721 --> 01:03:12.554
- All right.

01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:14.156
- Yeah.

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:19.161
- Did you mean
what you said to Kayla?

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:20.862
- You heard that?

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:22.631
- Well, I didn't mean to

01:03:22.699 --> 01:03:24.332
but yeah,

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:26.835
a little, a lot.

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:28.770
I heard all of it.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.486

land on Santa's naughty list.

- Well, I didn't think of it
as eavesdropping.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:45.253
I thought of it more
as research.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.322
- Oh, well, in that case,

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.591
I meant every word I said.

01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:53.995
So, how was that research?

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.468
- You know, I think I could use
a little bit more studying.

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:02.204
- Uh, uh-hmm.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.572
- That didn't take
long at all.

- I'm sorry to interrupt

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:07.108
but this said gentleman wants

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:08.610
to look around the property.

01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:12.647
His company owns
the deed to the lodge.

01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:14.616
- I apologize
for the intrusion.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:17.719
- So many surprises
this Christmas.

01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:19.020
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:20.488
Didn't Jared tell you

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:21.823
why I was coming?

01:04:22.726 --> 01:04:25.160
- You guys know each other?

01:04:25.229 --> 01:04:27.262
- Molly Clark,
let me introduce you

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:30.432
to the president of Davis
Investment Corporation,

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.434
William Davis,

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:33.835
my father.

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:43.245
- Molly, wait, let me explain.

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:44.713
- It's a little late
for that.

01:04:44.781 --> 01:04:46.214
- I didn't mean
to hurt you.

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:47.616
- Really?

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:48.950
Then why did you lie to me?

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:50.318
- I didn't.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:51.753
I mean, not exactly.

01:04:51.822 --> 01:04:53.488
Well, I told you I work

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:54.856
for my father's corporation.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:57.392
- Yes, and you conveniently
left out the rest.

01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:00.996
- What was I supposed
to say?

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:02.064
Oh, you want a trip?

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:03.798
I'm here to foreclose

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:04.966

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:06.534
and their reindeer ranch.

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:09.604
- No, but I would have
appreciated the truth.

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:11.339
- I know, I know

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:14.409
and I'm sorry.

This is the first Christmas

01:05:19.016 --> 01:05:21.383

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:23.885
I didn't wanna lose that,

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:25.353
are you?

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:30.392
- Oh, Molly, there's
a phone call for you.

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:39.034
- Thanks.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:40.435
Hello?

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.240
Uh-huh.

You do?

- Yeah, there's a cancelation

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.120
on tomorrow's flight
to Chicago.

I'm still gonna be here tonight

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:12.534
Well, we've enjoyed
having you here and...

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:14.936
you're gonna miss Christmas.

the Christmas I need this year.

a word with you?

- Not a good time, William.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.108
you've missed in my life,

you're actually going to leave.

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:03.498
nobody could pass.

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:05.166
We all had to take
the side road.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:08.303
I... just about the whole town
is on the way.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.838
You know, everybody
just loves this place.

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:13.474
Around here, you could say
that the Reindeer Lodge

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:16.678
has been a real...
- Tradition.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:18.613
- Sure it has.

01:10:18.682 --> 01:10:20.949
I'll see you all inside.

- Hi.

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:31.993
- Thank you.
- This looks great.

01:10:32.062 --> 01:10:33.928
- Thank you, good.

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:36.631
- Darling...
- Oh.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.032
Excuse me.

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:39.567
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

- Yeah, Director Kayla's
photographs

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:13.868
are so [indistinct]
better than expected,

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:15.003
if it stays like this,

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:16.104
Reindeer Lodge will have

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:17.939
a very bright future.

- Are you leaving tomorrow?

01:11:26.283 --> 01:11:28.916
- Yeah, I have
to go back to work.

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:30.852
It's where I belong.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.787
- Thought you weren't sure
about that.

01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:39.227
- Well.
- What if you belong here

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:40.695
with me?

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:45.800
- Well, then think
about my businesses

01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:49.170
and there are no
unexpected surprises.

01:11:49.239 --> 01:11:51.572
- Molly, I wanted
to tell you the truth.

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.274
I did, it's just

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:55.910
by the time I built up
the courage to do it,

01:11:57.881 --> 01:11:59.847
I realized that
I was falling for you.

01:12:02.886 --> 01:12:04.152
- I'm really sorry, Jared.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.520
I got to go.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.569
- Merry Christmas, you guys.

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:23.004
- Thank you.

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:38.152
- You know, your grandfather
used to do that,

01:12:38.221 --> 01:12:40.788
sit and whittle for hours,

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.857
drove your grandmother crazy.

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:48.262
- Sorry you wasted
your time coming up here.

01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:50.064
- What do you mean?

01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:51.666
- Tonight was pretty
successful.

01:12:51.735 --> 01:12:52.934
It looks like Penny and Chris

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:55.036
would be able to keep
the lodge running

01:12:55.105 --> 01:12:57.238
for quite a while.
- Uh-hmm.

01:12:57.307 --> 01:12:59.907
Well, I didn't come up here
for business.

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:02.343
I knew you'd be able
to handle it just fine

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:05.279
whatever the outcome.

01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:07.548
- Why are you here?

01:13:07.617 --> 01:13:11.119
- I came up here
to see you.

01:13:11.187 --> 01:13:12.253
- Me?

01:13:12.322 --> 01:13:14.756
You see me every day
at the office.

01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:16.824
- We pass each other
in the hallways

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:19.460
and barely say hello.

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:22.463
All of our conversations
involve either contracts

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:24.732
or writing our contracts,
or signing.

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:26.167
- Well, that's how
you wanted it.

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:27.869
- I know

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:30.271
and I also know
that's my fault.

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:34.809
Listen Jared, I'm gonna
be retiring this year and, um,

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:37.545
I'm trying to get a few things

01:13:37.614 --> 01:13:39.881
straight in my life

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:43.684
and one of those things
is you and me.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:48.089
- What's this is for?

01:13:48.158 --> 01:13:49.635
- I know I'll never be
able to make up

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:51.826
all those years to you

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:54.095
but...

01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:56.497
to me, that's just a figure
on a balance sheet

01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:58.166
with all these people up here.

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:01.969
Tonight, it's obviously
much more than that.

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:03.805
- Yes, it's a part of the town,

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:06.507
it's... they love it

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:07.887
and I've only been here
a little while,

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:10.244
I can tell why, it's...
- Well,

01:14:10.313 --> 01:14:13.414
I knew you had something else
on your mind.

01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:15.950
I could hear it
in your voice on the phone.

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:21.656
I wish to get back to Chicago

01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:24.525
but let's not let
another year go by

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:27.528
without making time
for family.

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:32.567
Merry Christmas, son.

All right.

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:05.032

gingerbread men,

about that airline food.

01:15:14.644 --> 01:15:17.245
- No.

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:20.848

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:23.284
Well...

- Well, there is only
one door left.

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:27.922
- That you have
a question?

01:15:27.991 --> 01:15:29.490
- I could but I think

01:15:29.559 --> 01:15:33.728
you already know the answer.
- Oh, well,

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:37.832
I'll save it for later then.

say goodbye to Jared?
