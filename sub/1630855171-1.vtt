WEBVTT

01:34.611 --> 01:36.510
So what are your
plans for the summer?

01:36.648 --> 01:38.753
I'm going to Hawaii
with my boyfriend.

01:40.721 --> 01:41.791
That's nice.

01:43.206 --> 01:45.898
My old grandma...
She ruined everything.

01:46.036 --> 01:48.142
Now my whole
savings are gone.

01:50.351 --> 01:53.078
Alisha, I heard your dad
is all over TV

01:53.216 --> 01:54.976
because he finally
rescued those Mexican girls

01:55.115 --> 01:56.288
from the mafia.

01:56.426 --> 01:58.739
So, now summer
in Tijuana?

01:58.877 --> 02:00.292
You must be excited, right?

02:02.191 --> 02:03.985
Yeah, um...

02:04.952 --> 02:06.781
I don't know. I've...

02:07.679 --> 02:09.577
I've always kept
my distance from him.

02:10.820 --> 02:12.166
He keeps coming.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.310
I would kill for a guy like that
to be my father.

02:18.862 --> 02:20.485
- He's a hero.
-That's true.

02:20.623 --> 02:22.590
and he's super smoky.

02:23.867 --> 02:26.249
I even have my own plans
of going with her to Tijuana.

02:26.387 --> 02:27.940
So, tell us, A.

02:28.078 --> 02:30.322
Why are you really
going with your father?

02:30.460 --> 02:31.668
You tell me!

02:31.806 --> 02:33.222
I'm going with you.

02:33.912 --> 02:35.776
So, you both
are traveling together?

03:20.234 --> 03:21.960
Agent Mark Patson.

03:22.098 --> 03:24.652
Yes, the name seems to be
familiar to most of us.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.447
He's the same Agent Patson

03:26.585 --> 03:28.587
who eliminated
the deadly Gorilla gang

03:28.725 --> 03:30.727
and lost his wife
in the crossfire

03:30.865 --> 03:34.214
with one of the last surviving
gang members.

03:37.251 --> 03:40.323
It took his team some time to
track down the Mexican mafia

03:40.461 --> 03:42.256
who trafficked
these girls across the border--

03:42.394 --> 03:44.672
Well, there he is!

03:44.810 --> 03:46.226
Hey, hey, no!

03:46.364 --> 03:48.158
Don'’t you even start.
Don't do it.

03:48.297 --> 03:51.058
- Hi Agent Mark. Congrats.
- Hey, Sofia. Nice to see you.

03:51.196 --> 03:52.715
Hey, Chris.
How you doing?

03:52.853 --> 03:55.027
You have saved us
from a crisis, Mark.

03:55.165 --> 03:56.650
The nation is proud.

03:56.788 --> 03:59.411
The shot that you took
for such a long distance

03:59.549 --> 04:02.725
and without any light proved
your perfect skills.

04:02.863 --> 04:05.037
I'm proud to work
under you, Agent Mark.

04:05.175 --> 04:06.901
Well, don't be too proud of me.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.593
Be proud of Tijuana police.
They took the shot.

04:09.594 --> 04:11.768
This is much
interesting to see

04:11.906 --> 04:14.564
than the Gorilla gang
takedown in San Diego.

04:14.702 --> 04:16.773
Good memory for that.
Thanks, Sofia.

04:16.911 --> 04:18.361
You're too kind.

04:18.499 --> 04:20.363
Okay, look.
I appreciate it,

04:20.501 --> 04:22.986
but just get back to what
you all were doing, okay?

04:23.124 --> 04:24.436
- Sir?
- Mm?

04:24.574 --> 04:25.679
Can I have a
quiet word, please?

04:25.817 --> 04:26.990
Sure.

04:29.579 --> 04:31.236
Tijuana police.

04:31.374 --> 04:32.341
Bravo!

04:32.479 --> 04:33.790
Hey, Ivan.

04:34.239 --> 04:35.999
Thanks for
the support, okay?

04:36.137 --> 04:38.623
And then again, honestly,
I just wanna say

04:38.761 --> 04:40.694
I appreciate the support
over the years.

04:40.832 --> 04:42.005
I mean that.

04:48.115 --> 04:49.599
So, what
can I do for you, Mark?

05:03.475 --> 05:05.063
What is this?

05:05.201 --> 05:06.961
Is this is a joke?

05:07.099 --> 05:09.067
Come on, Mark. Why now?

05:09.205 --> 05:11.000
Look, I would suggest

05:11.138 --> 05:13.830
that this is not the right time
for early retirement.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.075
With all due respect sir,
I think I've made my decision.

05:18.248 --> 05:19.560
Look, I've been planning this

05:19.698 --> 05:21.700
since Catherine
passed away, John.

05:21.838 --> 05:23.633
Since Alisha
walked out of my life.

05:24.462 --> 05:26.705
Kind of why I
took this particular job.

05:28.673 --> 05:31.261
And I understand, okay? I do.

05:33.194 --> 05:34.886
I'll tell you what;
why don't you take the night

05:35.024 --> 05:37.509
and think about it?
Okay?

05:41.513 --> 05:42.928
You know what?

05:43.066 --> 05:45.103
I realized something
when we reunited

05:45.241 --> 05:48.313
that family
with those little girls.

05:48.451 --> 05:51.558
And, uh, I realized
I'm a horrible father.

05:52.559 --> 05:55.285
I realized I've never
been there for Alisha.

05:55.424 --> 05:57.702
I mean, she blames me
for Catherine's death, John.

05:59.220 --> 06:01.637
So, you see,
I've got this little...

06:02.741 --> 06:03.949
This little window
of opportunity

06:04.087 --> 06:05.848
to do something right.

06:05.986 --> 06:08.368
Before her hatred washes me
completely from her heart.

06:08.506 --> 06:11.232
And I'm not gonna let
that happen. I'm not.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.270
Hm...

06:15.547 --> 06:17.204
So, what are
your plans for summer now?

06:19.068 --> 06:20.207
Thank you, sir.

07:40.908 --> 07:42.254
Hey.

07:43.532 --> 07:45.188
Okay, who are you
and what are you doing here?

07:47.328 --> 07:49.158
What are you doing--
What are you doing here, buddy?

07:50.780 --> 07:51.919
Put your hands
on your head.

07:52.057 --> 07:53.473
Put your hands on your head!

07:53.611 --> 07:55.371
God, Mark!

07:55.509 --> 07:58.029
It's the plumber I brought
to fix the drain, remember?

07:58.167 --> 07:59.479
Oh, Jesus, Miriam.
I'm sorry.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.999
Okay, I don't care.
Wait a minute.

08:03.137 --> 08:04.932
Tell him I wanna
see his passport. Your ID!

08:05.070 --> 08:06.486
It's all okay.

08:11.145 --> 08:13.044
He's all good, Mark.

08:13.182 --> 08:14.908
Trust me.
You know me, hon.

08:16.047 --> 08:18.152
I'm sorry, okay?

08:24.642 --> 08:26.506
-I'm sorry. I forgot.
-That's okay.

08:27.368 --> 08:29.129
Pardon, senor.

08:29.267 --> 08:30.820
No problem.

08:33.374 --> 08:36.067
- He speaks perfect English.
- It's okay.

08:36.205 --> 08:38.725
Is it me or did he sound
like he was from Malibu?

08:40.830 --> 08:41.969
What can I get you?

08:42.107 --> 08:43.246
Do you want a coffee?

08:43.384 --> 08:44.593
You're adorable.

09:24.529 --> 09:25.565
Hi.

09:30.915 --> 09:32.848
You haven't changed
that much at all.

09:34.539 --> 09:36.610
I didn't expect
to see you here.

09:37.991 --> 09:40.234
I was planning
to catch a cab.

09:41.270 --> 09:44.031
Well, I'm here.

09:44.894 --> 09:46.758
And of course
I'm gonna be here, Alisha.

09:46.896 --> 09:48.933
You're still my daughter
after all, right?

09:50.313 --> 09:52.971
Let's be very clear on this.

09:54.835 --> 09:58.770
I buried all of the memories
I have with you

09:58.908 --> 10:01.255
the day that
I lost my mom.

10:01.946 --> 10:04.224
I'm just here
for my summer vacation.

10:05.294 --> 10:07.986
So let's just stay
out of each other's way

10:08.642 --> 10:10.610
and you can carry
on with your life.

10:11.507 --> 10:13.613
And you let
me do my own thing.

11:24.891 --> 11:26.582
You're sure
you're not coming?

11:26.720 --> 11:29.274
It's gonna be so much fun!
Please, please, please!

11:29.412 --> 11:31.311
I'm good.
I'm gonna stay here.

11:31.449 --> 11:33.313
Okay, study for me.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.420
I'll take
a shot for you.

11:37.558 --> 11:39.768
Take four shots.
Everybody take shots.

11:39.906 --> 11:41.839
Okay, let's go. Bye!

11:43.875 --> 11:46.050
- Come on, girls!
- Bye! Have a great night!

11:46.188 --> 11:47.223
Bye.

11:47.361 --> 11:48.431
You too!

11:49.156 --> 11:50.571
Be safe.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.125
And sober! Love you!

11:52.263 --> 11:53.816
Sober.

12:34.650 --> 12:36.652
Do you feel like
stopping for some food?

12:38.619 --> 12:40.138
No.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.832
Well, there's
no food at the house.

12:45.419 --> 12:46.973
I'll tell you what.

12:47.111 --> 12:48.906
I'm gonna stop and get us
a little something, okay?

13:02.851 --> 13:04.369
- Hey, man!
- Hey!

13:04.507 --> 13:05.992
-That's for me, right?
-Yeah.

13:06.130 --> 13:07.372
Oh, you guys are fast!

13:07.510 --> 13:10.099
Okay, that's great. Okay.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.619
Do me a favor.
Just give me a...

13:12.757 --> 13:14.207
one latte to go and no sugar.
Okay, boss?

13:14.345 --> 13:15.933
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:30.637 --> 13:32.190
- Hey!
- Hey!

13:32.328 --> 13:34.468
What are you doing?
This is my friend, Viola!

13:34.606 --> 13:36.022
Oh, geez!
I'm sorry, Alisha!

13:36.160 --> 13:37.678
I... I'm sorry, I...

13:37.817 --> 13:40.198
It's okay.
No need to apologize. I'm fine.

13:40.336 --> 13:41.855
I appreciate
your kindness.

13:41.993 --> 13:43.892
Hey, so I'll see
you after my trip?

13:44.962 --> 13:46.826
It was really nice
meeting you, agent Mark.

13:46.964 --> 13:48.517
I appreciate you.

13:48.655 --> 13:51.002
And good luck
with Stephen.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.693
- Bye!
- See you.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.717
So, who's Stephen?

14:18.685 --> 14:20.376
Don't worry about it.

14:20.514 --> 14:23.069
I worry about everything.
You know that, right?

14:25.071 --> 14:26.520
Is that what I know?

16:16.354 --> 16:17.493
Come on in.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.326
Okay, come on in.
Come on.

16:23.637 --> 16:25.260
This is it.

16:25.398 --> 16:27.020
Built it about
five or six years ago

16:27.158 --> 16:28.711
with a real good friend of mine.

16:28.849 --> 16:30.955
Every stone, the wood.

16:31.093 --> 16:33.406
As I said, there's a story
for everything in this place.

16:33.544 --> 16:34.752
I won't bore you for now.

16:34.890 --> 16:36.547
Plumbing,
we got a little problem,

16:36.685 --> 16:38.859
but you've got hot water,
so that's a good thing, eh?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.930
Your room
is up top there on the left.

16:41.069 --> 16:42.829
Uh, this is it.

16:42.967 --> 16:45.038
What can I say?
Make yourself at home.

16:45.176 --> 16:46.522
- Great.
- Okay?

16:46.660 --> 16:48.007
Let me help you up with the bag.

16:48.145 --> 16:49.491
I got it. No worries here.

16:49.629 --> 16:50.699
Okay.

16:53.909 --> 16:55.669
Right up to the left.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.188
That's you.

16:57.326 --> 16:58.776
Right.

16:58.914 --> 17:00.467
Okay, anything
you need just let me know.

17:09.925 --> 17:11.340
God damnit.

17:33.362 --> 17:34.915
Give me the mayonnaise, man.

17:35.813 --> 17:36.883
No.

17:47.031 --> 17:48.377
- Dad.
- Mm-hmm?

17:49.033 --> 17:51.898
You know that you're the talk
of the town, right?

17:52.036 --> 17:53.727
Like, all my school

17:53.865 --> 17:55.971
is talking about
the Gorilla gang takedown...

17:56.109 --> 17:58.353
Alisha. Time for school.

17:59.733 --> 18:03.116
And you do know that this is
putting our family at risk?

18:04.531 --> 18:07.224
We're not safe because of you.

18:07.362 --> 18:09.364
And you being
in your limelight.

18:10.572 --> 18:12.505
Like, do you think
about our family at all

18:12.643 --> 18:14.162
when you're out there
saving whoever you're saving?

18:14.300 --> 18:15.818
That's enough, Alisha!

18:15.956 --> 18:17.820
- Of course I do.
- Do you think about us?

18:17.958 --> 18:19.719
Okay, Alisha,
that's enough.

18:19.857 --> 18:21.169
You're gonna be late.

18:21.307 --> 18:22.618
Alisha.

18:22.756 --> 18:23.964
Come on, just give me a second.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.174
It's not that simple.

18:26.312 --> 18:29.522
See you sweetie.
I love you, dear.

18:41.810 --> 18:43.294
I don't know but...

18:44.295 --> 18:45.538
I...

18:46.332 --> 18:48.092
She's right. At the end
of the day, she's right.

18:48.230 --> 18:50.439
- No, no, no, no.
-No, she's right.

18:52.476 --> 18:54.167
Oh, man.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.652
You guys are my family.

18:57.653 --> 19:00.069
Maybe she'll see
that one day, but that's it.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.588
You guys are everything to me.

19:01.726 --> 19:03.176
I know.

19:06.662 --> 19:08.181
Why don't we go to the bank?

19:08.319 --> 19:09.527
Sure, okay.

19:10.632 --> 19:11.874
- Okay?
-You got it.

19:12.012 --> 19:13.669
Five minutes?
Okay, let's go.

19:13.807 --> 19:15.361
- To the bank.
- Maybe stop for something

19:15.499 --> 19:17.190
to eat on the way back?
Get some food? Something?

19:17.328 --> 19:18.847
-Okay.
- Okay? Okay.

19:35.312 --> 19:36.761
Okay.

19:36.899 --> 19:38.556
Okay, I'm gonna
go quickly to the bank.

19:38.694 --> 19:40.179
- Gonna get us some money, baby?
- Yeah.

19:40.317 --> 19:42.111
- Yeah? A lot of money?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:42.871 --> 19:44.252
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

19:44.390 --> 19:45.874
I'll be here.

20:56.427 --> 20:57.566
Hey, Miriam! Come on in!

20:57.704 --> 20:59.119
Hey, Mark!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.225
Brought you and
Alisha some food tonight.

21:01.363 --> 21:02.813
Ah, thank you.

21:02.951 --> 21:04.849
How kind of you.
Save me some cooking time

21:04.987 --> 21:06.472
'cause you know
how bad I am at cooking.

21:06.610 --> 21:08.128
- No!
- Thanks, sweetheart.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.716
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you what.

21:09.854 --> 21:11.822
Do you have a minute?
She's in her room.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.100
Think maybe it's a good time
we introduce you to her.

21:14.238 --> 21:16.102
- What do you think?
- I'd love to meet her.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.000
- I'd love that too. Come on.
- All right.

21:28.597 --> 21:29.667
Yup?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.738
Hey.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.190
So, uh... Hey, look.
Sorry to disturb you.

21:35.328 --> 21:38.193
I just wanted to introduce you
to an old friend of mine, okay?

21:38.331 --> 21:39.988
One of my dearest friends.
Her name is Miriam.

21:40.126 --> 21:41.438
She lives next door.

21:41.576 --> 21:43.302
She's the one who's been
watching over me

21:43.440 --> 21:45.442
and the house for years.
I just wanted you to say hello.

21:45.580 --> 21:46.788
Hey.

21:48.755 --> 21:50.343
I think we had a deal

21:50.481 --> 21:52.621
that we weren't going
to bother each other.

21:53.795 --> 21:57.039
So, please,
enjoy the day with your friend.

21:57.177 --> 21:58.213
All right.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.697
Hey, Mark.

21:59.835 --> 22:01.492
You know, I left
the hot plate on, hon.

22:01.630 --> 22:03.736
Just go and check on that.
Let her rest.

22:03.874 --> 22:05.116
- All right?
- Okay.

22:05.254 --> 22:06.704
It's a pleasure
to meet you, hon.

22:06.842 --> 22:08.188
Nice to meet you.

23:27.889 --> 23:29.166
Off of me!

24:40.168 --> 24:42.170
Hi! Hi, sir!

24:42.308 --> 24:46.001
So, I... Somebody stole
my wallet, basically.

24:46.139 --> 24:47.589
And I need to get home.

24:47.727 --> 24:49.695
But I don't have any
money to give you now.

24:53.284 --> 24:55.010
Okay, I'll give you the money
when I get home.

24:57.392 --> 24:59.187
It's not that far.

24:59.325 --> 25:01.051
We can just
go there and I'll...

25:01.189 --> 25:02.846
I'll give you...

25:03.881 --> 25:05.055
I have...

25:28.492 --> 25:29.769
Hey, so...

25:29.907 --> 25:31.771
I need a ride home.

25:31.909 --> 25:35.637
Someone just stole my cell phone
and my wallet and my money.

25:35.775 --> 25:40.228
But I can give you my
money when I get home.

25:40.366 --> 25:41.919
-Sure.
- Okay, uh...

25:43.093 --> 25:44.197
No, we're good.

25:44.335 --> 25:45.647
No, you can go.

25:45.785 --> 25:47.856
You can go!
I'll get the next one.

25:48.616 --> 25:50.272
Sure, we're good.

25:51.170 --> 25:52.551
No, we're good.

25:52.689 --> 25:54.829
I'll drive you.
Just get in.

25:54.967 --> 25:56.037
No.

25:56.762 --> 25:58.557
- All right.
-Hey, hey!

26:00.248 --> 26:02.388
- Alisha?
- Damn it.

26:02.802 --> 26:03.872
Shh!

26:04.701 --> 26:06.288
I'm your neighbor.

26:06.426 --> 26:08.532
Brought you and your dad
food the other night.

26:10.223 --> 26:12.363
What's the matter, baby?
Oh!

26:24.065 --> 26:25.894
I'm sorry
about yesterday.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.863
I know I
was rude before.

26:30.174 --> 26:31.659
Don't worry about it.

26:31.797 --> 26:33.937
Tell me what you
were doing out there.

26:35.145 --> 26:39.598
Someone pickpocketed my wallet
and I had my cell phone in it.

26:39.736 --> 26:41.082
I tried to call my dad,

26:41.220 --> 26:43.049
but he keeps changing
his number.

26:43.187 --> 26:44.913
And then no taxi

26:45.051 --> 26:47.191
was gonna give me a ride home
without money, and...

26:48.986 --> 26:50.298
Then you showed up.

26:50.436 --> 26:52.921
I'm glad that I did.

26:53.059 --> 26:54.682
Let's tell
your father...

26:54.820 --> 26:58.271
No! Can we just stop
and keep this between us?

26:59.790 --> 27:02.379
I don't wanna
involve him.

27:02.517 --> 27:04.623
At least let
me help find--

27:04.761 --> 27:06.901
Just have your dad
find your cell phone

27:07.039 --> 27:09.248
and your wallet, okay?

27:09.386 --> 27:10.870
That's all.

27:11.008 --> 27:12.113
That's all we're gonna tell him.

27:12.251 --> 27:13.424
Okay.

27:15.150 --> 27:16.496
Hey, Mark!

27:16.635 --> 27:18.360
Yes, I'm out
with Alisha, baby.

27:18.498 --> 27:19.810
We went shopping.

27:19.948 --> 27:21.812
Oh, yes, yes.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.539
While we were shopping

27:24.677 --> 27:27.197
she misplaced her
cell phone and wallet.

27:27.335 --> 27:28.819
Can you
find it, please?

27:28.957 --> 27:31.132
Perfect.

27:31.270 --> 27:32.892
We'll be home soon.

27:34.238 --> 27:36.551
See? It's okay.

27:45.180 --> 27:46.803
Alisha, baby,
it looks great.

27:46.941 --> 27:48.183
I hope you like it.

27:48.321 --> 27:49.495
I know we will.

27:49.633 --> 27:51.428
I know your dad will too.

27:55.190 --> 27:56.675
Thank you for today.

27:56.813 --> 28:00.679
No. I'm just glad
I was there for you, baby.

28:03.716 --> 28:04.752
Hey, guys.

28:06.995 --> 28:09.204
- So...
-That was quick.

28:09.342 --> 28:11.897
Hey, what can I say?
I know a few people.

28:12.898 --> 28:15.935
Some guy called Stephen has been
ringing for you, over and over.

28:16.073 --> 28:17.903
Maybe you should call him back
and tell him you're okay.

28:18.041 --> 28:20.215
Maybe I should
do that, definitely.

28:20.353 --> 28:21.907
Thanks.

28:29.190 --> 28:30.847
Miriam,
who's this Stephen guy?

28:30.985 --> 28:33.056
I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

28:33.194 --> 28:35.196
But I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

28:35.334 --> 28:36.853
Mark, you...

28:38.786 --> 28:40.788
Cheers, love. Thanks for dinner.
Who made this?

28:40.926 --> 28:42.237
-Your baby.
- She made it?

28:42.375 --> 28:44.101
She did.

28:46.103 --> 28:48.623
I cannot wait
to see you, babe.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.590
See you soon.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.627
See you soon.

28:58.184 --> 29:00.255
What if I say
I have a boyfriend?

29:00.393 --> 29:01.705
But...

29:01.843 --> 29:03.914
You don't, so... It's just us.

29:05.019 --> 29:06.710
Us?

29:06.848 --> 29:09.471
Seems like you've already made
my decision for me.

29:09.609 --> 29:11.784
Of course!
I'm confident.

29:14.028 --> 29:15.892
So...?

29:16.030 --> 29:18.066
What are your plans
for this summer?

29:19.378 --> 29:22.346
I am making my
bucket list as we speak.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.765
I hope that you're
adding me to that list.

29:28.145 --> 29:29.388
Maybe.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.115
We just have to plan it.

29:46.923 --> 29:49.028
Now, let's say
grace really quick.

29:49.166 --> 29:50.892
I've got to watch
my favorite program, okay?

29:52.169 --> 29:53.515
Please.

29:53.653 --> 29:54.723
Dear Lord in Heaven,

29:56.277 --> 29:58.037
bless this food
we're about to receive.

29:58.175 --> 30:00.212
Bless everybody
in this house,

30:00.350 --> 30:04.423
Please, bless some will forgive
others for all their craziness.

30:04.561 --> 30:05.665
Amen.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.184
Amen.

30:07.322 --> 30:09.048
Your baby made this.

30:09.186 --> 30:10.360
You made this?

30:10.498 --> 30:12.189
I made it, yeah.

30:12.327 --> 30:14.813
-You can cook?
- I can.

30:14.951 --> 30:16.538
You're not an eater,
but you can cook.

30:16.676 --> 30:18.402
How does
that work, Miriam?

30:18.540 --> 30:21.198
I mean, usually people
that like to cook like to eat.

30:21.336 --> 30:22.821
I don't know.
Let's see what you got, kid.

30:22.959 --> 30:24.650
Had to learn a thing
or two on my own.

30:24.788 --> 30:26.169
I'm sure you did.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.124
- Hi.
-Hi, babe.

30:50.262 --> 30:52.436
I couldn't stop thinking about
you since last time we talk.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.095
Yeah.
It's been a long 30 minutes.

30:56.233 --> 30:57.959
Well,
for you it's been 30 minutes,

30:58.097 --> 31:00.375
for me it feels like a year.

31:00.513 --> 31:02.274
Time freezes.

31:02.412 --> 31:04.207
Oh, only when
I'm talking with you.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.832
So, I was thinking...

31:09.937 --> 31:11.870
What would you like
to do when we see each other?

31:14.424 --> 31:16.909
Ah, Stephen. Let me call you
back in a second.

31:27.575 --> 31:28.576
Dad.

31:57.432 --> 31:58.675
I'm okay.

32:03.645 --> 32:05.268
It's not the first time.

32:05.406 --> 32:06.476
Okay.

32:06.614 --> 32:08.374
That's enough, Dad.

32:12.896 --> 32:13.862
Okay.

32:14.001 --> 32:15.243
You were right.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.419
It's all my fault.

32:20.766 --> 32:22.423
It's all my fault that...

32:23.286 --> 32:24.839
Agent...

32:24.977 --> 32:26.945
Good old Patson...

32:29.775 --> 32:32.536
I can't
even find this...

32:32.674 --> 32:35.608
shooter who killed my wife.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.377
I am a complete failure.

32:48.035 --> 32:49.553
I'm sorry.

32:49.691 --> 32:51.659
I really, really...

32:52.487 --> 32:53.972
I'm sorry.

33:07.502 --> 33:09.677
You're gonna
go to sleep now.

35:21.774 --> 35:23.121
Good morning, Miriam.

35:24.501 --> 35:26.331
Oh, look who's up.

35:26.469 --> 35:28.160
Yeah.

35:28.816 --> 35:30.197
Hey, I appreciate
this, thanks.

35:30.335 --> 35:32.060
Oh, it's not me.

35:32.199 --> 35:35.063
Alisha did that and she took
care of you last night.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.032
Yeah.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.516
And where is she?

35:39.654 --> 35:41.208
Oh, she just
went for a run, honey.

35:41.346 --> 35:42.830
She'll be back soon.

35:42.968 --> 35:44.797
Miriam, didn't I
tell you not to leave her alone?

35:44.935 --> 35:47.110
That's the one thing I asked
you, not to leave her alone.

35:47.248 --> 35:48.698
Mark, you didn't think

35:48.836 --> 35:50.665
I was gonna go running with her,
did you?

35:50.803 --> 35:52.150
Come on.

36:13.309 --> 36:15.242
Oh, there she is.

36:15.794 --> 36:16.967
Come say hello-- what...?

36:18.003 --> 36:19.591
What?

36:19.729 --> 36:22.076
Baby girl, what
happened? Come over here.

36:22.214 --> 36:23.388
Oh, my God.

36:23.526 --> 36:24.699
What happened?

36:25.355 --> 36:27.185
Mark, Mark.
Get me the first aid kit.

36:27.323 --> 36:28.841
- Jesus!
- Mark, please.

36:31.050 --> 36:32.224
It's alright.

36:32.362 --> 36:33.743
No, it's not.

36:33.881 --> 36:35.262
Hold it like this, baby.

36:36.608 --> 36:37.850
- Okay.
-Thank you.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.369
Give me a look at this.

36:39.507 --> 36:40.853
I wanna
know what happened.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.234
Tell me--
I wanna know what happened!

36:42.372 --> 36:43.856
Tell me what happened right now.

36:46.825 --> 36:49.552
Please, tell us what happened.

36:50.932 --> 36:52.417
I don't know. I was...

36:52.555 --> 36:54.108
Running and...

36:54.246 --> 36:56.800
There was this guy who
tried to hit me, so...

36:57.560 --> 36:59.251
Do you remember
anything about the man?

36:59.389 --> 37:01.874
The vehicle, any numbers,
any body features of the driver?

37:02.012 --> 37:03.428
Come on, Mark.

37:03.566 --> 37:05.119
She's not gonna
remember any of that.

37:05.257 --> 37:08.640
A-L-A-15-0-1-A.

37:08.778 --> 37:10.711
It was a man
with a black hood.

37:10.849 --> 37:13.300
And a jacket.
Mid-forties.

37:13.438 --> 37:14.680
Right-handed.

37:17.890 --> 37:20.893
Never got that shit
from my dad's DNA.

37:23.102 --> 37:24.828
Hey, Victor.
It's Mark.

37:24.966 --> 37:27.417
Do me a favor.
Run a number on a plate for me.

37:27.555 --> 37:30.144
ALA-15-0-1-A.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.559
Yeah, you got it.

37:55.445 --> 37:57.136
So, office
came back with word

37:57.275 --> 37:59.553
that the fake plate
your daughter talked about

37:59.691 --> 38:00.899
actually belongs
to a rookie

38:01.037 --> 38:02.832
who does low-end
drug peddling.

38:03.626 --> 38:05.179
He reported
it missing last week.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.801
But it turns out
he's the one that stole

38:06.939 --> 38:08.803
and put the fake plate on it.

38:08.941 --> 38:11.358
On top of that, the night
before there's a robbery.

38:11.496 --> 38:13.877
Same place, same location,
same vehicle.

38:14.015 --> 38:15.500
Just merely
a coincidence.

38:15.638 --> 38:17.295
I mean, we are on it, but...

38:17.433 --> 38:19.297
I don't think it has
anything to do with your family.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.577
Let's hope so.

38:24.129 --> 38:25.889
Yeah.
We're on it, though,

38:26.027 --> 38:28.236
so if you need anything,
just let me know.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.893
Thanks for coming out, Victor.

38:30.031 --> 38:31.619
- It's a pleasure.
- Okay.

38:33.172 --> 38:34.622
- See you.
- All right.

38:41.802 --> 38:43.217
Who's that?

38:43.493 --> 38:46.841
That's Victor.
He works with your father.

38:46.979 --> 38:50.120
I believe it's about the license
plate number you gave him.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.228
You guys
ready to do some shooting?

38:54.366 --> 38:57.714
Your dad also mentioned possibly
going to the shooting range.

38:57.852 --> 38:59.267
Won't that be fun?

39:01.062 --> 39:03.030
Maybe we can
hit the beach after.

39:03.996 --> 39:05.343
Super cool.

39:08.207 --> 39:10.037
Let's go kill
us something, babe.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.189
Let me ask you a question.
What do they call you?

39:24.327 --> 39:26.018
- Uh, Big Mike.
- Big Mike.

39:26.156 --> 39:27.882
Okay, Big Mike,
here's the deal.

39:28.020 --> 39:30.229
If that sink isn't fixed
by the time we're back,

39:30.368 --> 39:31.852
I'm taking you to jail.

39:55.496 --> 39:56.532
You're
getting there.

39:57.567 --> 39:59.535
You're getting
there, Miriam.

39:59.673 --> 40:01.433
Let's see what you've got.

40:02.676 --> 40:04.850
I want you to
listen to something, okay?

40:04.988 --> 40:06.749
The only person
in this life that you think

40:06.887 --> 40:09.786
you can trust other than
yourself is me.

40:09.924 --> 40:11.754
Because
I'm your father,

40:11.892 --> 40:14.412
and I would never do anything
to hurt you, you understand?

40:31.498 --> 40:34.742
Damn it, Mark!
There's your fucking DNA again.

42:56.470 --> 42:58.092
- Dad?
-Jesus Christ!

42:58.230 --> 42:59.231
- Brace yourselves!
-Dad!

42:59.369 --> 43:01.371
God! Shit!

43:19.148 --> 43:20.667
Yeah.

43:47.832 --> 43:49.074
She'll be fine.

43:49.212 --> 43:50.317
-Really?
-Yes.

44:37.985 --> 44:39.193
Hey.

44:39.987 --> 44:41.195
How's she doing?

44:43.094 --> 44:45.027
We'll see.
I hope she's okay.

44:45.993 --> 44:47.339
Look, uh...

44:48.409 --> 44:50.342
They found a bunch
of needles in the wheel.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.861
Tore it apart.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.553
It's all we got.

44:56.210 --> 44:58.005
- Thanks, Victor.
- Yeah.

44:58.143 --> 44:59.904
This ain't
no coincidence.

45:00.836 --> 45:02.354
You're right.

45:02.492 --> 45:03.666
Hope she
gets better soon.

45:03.804 --> 45:05.116
She'll be okay.

45:05.254 --> 45:06.773
- Good. All right.
- I'll see you.

45:06.911 --> 45:08.740
- Okay.
- Thanks, man.

45:42.015 --> 45:44.638
Sir. Sir!

45:44.776 --> 45:46.536
This area is restricted.
I'm sorry, you cannot enter.

45:46.674 --> 45:48.607
Man, we don't need to do this.
Just come with me.

46:39.831 --> 46:41.522
I miss...

46:42.420 --> 46:43.662
My mom.

46:46.734 --> 46:50.462
I haven't been
in a hospital since...

46:55.709 --> 46:57.366
I'll tell
you a little story

46:57.504 --> 46:59.333
about when
I was in the hospital.

47:00.645 --> 47:02.164
When I met your mother.

47:03.648 --> 47:05.098
You might like it.

47:07.376 --> 47:08.826
It's about
meeting your mom.

47:12.588 --> 47:13.865
Back in '91.

47:17.006 --> 47:20.182
I was special forces
during the Gulf War, and...

47:21.528 --> 47:22.598
I got shot.

47:24.565 --> 47:27.154
So they take me
to this medical clinic.

47:28.673 --> 47:31.503
It's a military hospital.

47:31.641 --> 47:33.402
And it was in tangent

47:33.540 --> 47:36.474
with this cancer treatment
facility, right?

47:40.167 --> 47:41.997
They're tending to my wound.

47:43.653 --> 47:45.414
I look up, and there she is.

47:46.518 --> 47:48.451
Tall.

47:48.589 --> 47:50.246
Bald.

47:50.384 --> 47:52.283
Proud and...

47:53.491 --> 47:54.561
Beautiful.

47:56.459 --> 47:58.772
She was telling the clerk how
she didn't have any money

47:58.910 --> 48:01.361
to make her payments for the
next three or four treatments.

48:03.052 --> 48:05.399
And how she wouldn't be alive

48:07.367 --> 48:09.576
if she didn't
get the treatments.

48:11.854 --> 48:14.201
I had a little
money back then so I, uh,

48:15.823 --> 48:17.618
I took care of the payments.

48:18.757 --> 48:20.656
She got her treatments.

48:21.588 --> 48:23.901
Little did I know that...

48:25.281 --> 48:27.352
at that time,
who knew that that woman,

48:27.490 --> 48:30.114
that big, bald, beautiful woman

48:30.252 --> 48:32.150
would end up becoming
my whole life.

48:42.022 --> 48:43.575
Can I ask you something?

48:44.783 --> 48:45.888
Sure.

48:47.545 --> 48:49.271
Who's that person

48:50.341 --> 48:52.446
in the photo,
with the distorted face.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.451
You know.

48:59.005 --> 49:01.800
The one you keep
with the newspaper cuttings

49:01.939 --> 49:03.871
of mom's death.

49:08.290 --> 49:10.223
I'm gonna check you out
and get you home.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.415
Alisha, baby.

50:05.312 --> 50:06.865
It's my family.

50:09.351 --> 50:10.662
I miss them a lot.

50:12.354 --> 50:13.631
You must be.

50:15.357 --> 50:18.049
Yeah, but that's when
Mark came and...

50:18.187 --> 50:20.086
And then he brought you.

50:20.224 --> 50:22.536
Now the void is gone.

50:23.710 --> 50:25.919
I feel like
I have a family again.

50:29.750 --> 50:31.683
Oh, it's okay, baby.

50:32.443 --> 50:34.755
But why are you
dressed like this?

50:35.722 --> 50:38.380
My friend Viola
wants me to hang out with her

50:38.518 --> 50:40.865
but I don't think...

50:41.003 --> 50:43.178
Yeah, you're right.
Your father will not let you go.

50:43.316 --> 50:44.834
Yeah, so
if you could...

50:49.529 --> 50:52.014
Only if you promise
to take me to church tomorrow.

50:52.152 --> 50:53.360
Done.

50:53.498 --> 50:55.190
Fine, I'll cover for you.

50:56.743 --> 50:58.400
Oh, these kids.

51:13.932 --> 51:15.279
Should have been there by now.

51:15.417 --> 51:17.074
Yeah, I know but...

51:17.212 --> 51:19.559
What does it matter?
They're in the club already.

51:19.697 --> 51:21.423
Like they're three guys.

51:21.561 --> 51:23.494
My friends have been waiting
for me. I should be there.

51:23.632 --> 51:25.392
Yeah, I don't care
about your friends.

51:26.669 --> 51:28.361
What, should I care
about your friend then?

51:28.499 --> 51:30.328
Yeah.

51:30.466 --> 51:32.606
It's the first time you
meet her. She's my best friend.

51:33.849 --> 51:35.195
I really hope it's worth it.

51:35.333 --> 51:37.128
- Yeah.
- I really do.

51:38.164 --> 51:39.475
Yeah, here she comes.

51:47.449 --> 51:49.934
- Hey, baby! How are you?
- Hey guys.

51:50.072 --> 51:52.143
Meet the boy
of my life, Raul.

51:52.281 --> 51:54.628
Raul, meet Alisha.
She's my best friend, okay?

51:56.837 --> 51:58.805
We've gotta go.
We've gotta go.

52:13.889 --> 52:15.166
Here we are.

52:15.304 --> 52:16.650
This is the place.

52:16.788 --> 52:18.825
You brought me
to see naked ladies?

52:18.963 --> 52:20.378
Like, with your girlfriend?

52:20.516 --> 52:21.793
It wasn't my first place.

52:21.931 --> 52:23.450
Why would you do that?

52:23.588 --> 52:25.625
Have you been
to places like this?

52:25.763 --> 52:26.798
No.

52:26.936 --> 52:28.248
This place's so good.

52:28.386 --> 52:29.629
It's the best place
on the block.

52:29.767 --> 52:31.355
Well, it's uh...

52:31.493 --> 52:33.219
Let's have fun.

52:33.357 --> 52:36.429
Yeah, absolutely.
Let's get some shots. Shots?

52:36.567 --> 52:38.016
Can you freshen
up this hookah for me?

52:38.155 --> 52:39.880
Yeah, definitely.

52:40.018 --> 52:41.399
Do you have a cigarette?

52:41.537 --> 52:43.194
Yo! That's my boy.

52:43.332 --> 52:45.403
- Hey, Joseph!
- Hey!

52:45.541 --> 52:46.922
Give me two seconds.

52:47.060 --> 52:51.513
Yeah.
Hey, do you have a cigarette?

52:51.651 --> 52:54.343
So how are you feeling
about this place?

52:54.481 --> 52:56.242
What?

52:56.380 --> 52:58.175
You know I don't
like him for you, right?

52:59.969 --> 53:01.557
He says he's changed.

53:01.695 --> 53:03.904
Yeah. He says,
but apparently he hasn't.

53:04.802 --> 53:06.321
He loves me.

53:08.219 --> 53:09.738
I can handle him.

53:11.567 --> 53:13.086
I can handle him, I swear.

53:14.570 --> 53:16.158
It's okay, I'm okay.

53:16.296 --> 53:18.229
We are here to party.

53:18.367 --> 53:19.575
Get in the mood.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.514
Make some space.
Make some space.

53:27.652 --> 53:29.930
Make some space. There!

53:31.622 --> 53:33.486
Okay, here I got Joseph.

53:33.624 --> 53:36.109
- Panchito, and Benja.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

53:36.247 --> 53:38.042
Let's get some shots going.

53:47.845 --> 53:50.468
Ah, well, well.
Let's get this party going.

53:53.126 --> 53:54.955
No way, guys.
I don't do drugs.

53:55.093 --> 53:56.647
What do you mean
you don't do drugs?

53:56.785 --> 53:58.683
It's okay, it's fine.
You're here with me.

53:58.821 --> 54:00.789
Let's do this.

54:00.927 --> 54:02.825
We're here together,
nothing is going to happen.

54:02.963 --> 54:04.413
Don't worry, don't worry.

54:04.551 --> 54:06.001
Trust me.
You're here with me.

54:07.036 --> 54:09.073
Okay? Let's do this, eh?

54:12.973 --> 54:14.078
That's some
good stuff boys!

54:21.810 --> 54:24.088
Come on, come on.
Try, try.

54:26.815 --> 54:28.126
Go! Go! Go!

54:28.265 --> 54:32.096
Go! Go! Go!

54:45.627 --> 54:48.043
Hey! Get some more shots?
Come on!

54:48.181 --> 54:50.563
Babe, come on, let's get
some more shots.

55:36.850 --> 55:38.024
Hey. Where were you?

55:38.162 --> 55:39.922
- I was--
- I was in the bathroom.

55:40.060 --> 55:41.924
- Where is Viola?
- Ah, don't worry about it.

55:42.062 --> 55:44.686
- Come on. Give me a kiss.
- Stop.

55:46.170 --> 55:48.414
I said stop.

56:03.152 --> 56:04.568
What the fuck?

56:06.880 --> 56:07.916
Oh, my God!

56:32.492 --> 56:33.873
Who the fuck are you?

57:00.209 --> 57:01.901
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

57:02.039 --> 57:04.248
It's okay. Let's go.

57:04.386 --> 57:06.284
- It's okay
-I'm sorry.

57:35.797 --> 57:37.419
Hey...

57:39.628 --> 57:41.285
I'm sorry.

57:42.769 --> 57:44.530
What would've
happened if your dad

57:44.668 --> 57:46.463
wouldn't have gotten there
on time?

57:48.948 --> 57:49.983
I'm so sorry.

57:53.711 --> 57:55.195
It's okay.

58:06.379 --> 58:08.208
Okay, the car is here.
I have to go.

58:08.346 --> 58:10.763
Are you gonna see me tomorrow?
Are we gonna see each other?

58:10.901 --> 58:12.937
Yes, we're gonna see each other
tomorrow. Every day.

58:13.075 --> 58:14.387
Every day, yes.

58:16.562 --> 58:18.736
Okay, thank you
so much for being there.

58:20.220 --> 58:21.394
I love you.

58:23.361 --> 58:26.054
Okay? I'll see
you tomorrow, okay? Thanks.

58:47.247 --> 58:48.594
I'm so sorry.

58:48.732 --> 58:50.734
It was not her fault.
It was all mine.

58:50.872 --> 58:52.459
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

58:52.598 --> 58:54.565
I did a lot worse
when I was your age.

58:56.740 --> 58:59.087
Okay? Just don't it again.

58:59.225 --> 59:00.675
Okay? You're a good kid.

59:00.813 --> 59:02.228
And I like you being
her best friend.

59:02.366 --> 59:03.747
You're good for each other.

59:03.885 --> 59:05.162
You get that, right?

59:05.300 --> 59:07.026
- Yes.
- Okay.

59:07.164 --> 59:08.924
Now, if there's
anything you need,

59:09.062 --> 59:10.374
you let me know.

59:10.512 --> 59:12.065
All right?

59:18.727 --> 59:20.108
And I'm never drinking again.

59:20.246 --> 59:21.730
Me too.

59:23.214 --> 59:25.700
Okay. Look after her.
See you.

59:53.348 --> 59:55.937
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
Where are you guys going?

59:56.075 --> 59:57.490
Miriam, do you
have a minute, please?

59:57.628 --> 59:59.181
I wanna talk to
you guys about something.

59:59.319 --> 01:00:00.838
Yes, of course, Mark.

01:00:00.976 --> 01:00:03.082
But now I need
to speak to God.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.325
Talk to God, okay.
Can he wait five minutes, maybe?

01:00:05.463 --> 01:00:07.673
- What do you think?
- Oh, honey, you know me.

01:00:07.811 --> 01:00:09.260
I don't let God wait.

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:10.710
Take me to
church, Alisha.

01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:43.053
Yeah. After, you know...

01:00:43.191 --> 01:00:47.402
I lost my family,
and your dad...

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.646
He came in for me.

01:00:49.784 --> 01:00:51.544
Became my family.

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:53.650
Took care
of everything.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:25.785
Who was that?

01:01:25.923 --> 01:01:28.892
Oh, her son
had a terrible accident.

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:30.583
She couldn't pay for it.

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.068
Your father,
he took care of everything.

01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:35.761
And now her son is
going to the nationals.

01:01:35.899 --> 01:01:37.694
Isn't that great?

01:01:43.561 --> 01:01:45.356
I think we
should head home.

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:48.946
Ah, okay. First, let
me stop at the office.

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:50.741
You have an office?

01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:54.193
Of course
I have an office.

01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:55.608
Let's go.

01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:15.145
This is Alisha.

01:02:15.283 --> 01:02:17.768
Alisha, this is Juana.
She takes care of the place.

01:02:29.469 --> 01:02:31.092
Okay, okay.
I'll take care of that.

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:32.610
I'll have to take
a phone call, hon.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.440
You just go ahead
and look around.

01:02:34.578 --> 01:02:36.373
Juana will take
care of you, okay?

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:54.658
So how did you become
involved in this place?

01:03:54.796 --> 01:03:56.522
This organization?

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.732
It was handed
down to my husband.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.630
And...

01:04:01.768 --> 01:04:06.497
My husband put his blood, sweat,
and tears into this place.

01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:08.983
But after his passing,

01:04:10.294 --> 01:04:11.917
it all went down.

01:04:12.055 --> 01:04:14.436
Your father

01:04:14.574 --> 01:04:18.371
came in, financed us...

01:04:18.509 --> 01:04:21.996
He's the most
noble man that I know.

01:04:22.134 --> 01:04:24.791
That's why, Alisha baby,

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:29.417
you know deep down in your heart

01:04:29.555 --> 01:04:32.799
he's not to blame
for any of this.

01:04:55.615 --> 01:04:58.273
Well, well, well.
Look who has an appetite.

01:05:01.242 --> 01:05:03.623
I'm going to the store.
You need anything?

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:08.180
No, I don't think so.

01:05:08.318 --> 01:05:09.388
Okay.

01:05:10.976 --> 01:05:12.563
Enjoy your sandwich.

01:05:28.614 --> 01:05:30.029
Expecting something?

01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:31.513
No.

01:05:31.651 --> 01:05:33.343
It's got your name on it.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.278
See you.

01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:02.199
Expecting something?

01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:03.683
No.

01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:05.099
It's got your name on it.

01:06:20.114 --> 01:06:21.529
Hey.

01:06:22.461 --> 01:06:24.083
My keys...

01:06:24.221 --> 01:06:26.223
Where are my keys?
Did I leave my keys somewhere?

01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:28.018
No, you took your keys with you.

01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:30.124
-Are you sure?
- I saw you do it.

01:06:33.748 --> 01:06:36.578
I got the keys, right?
Yeah, I got the keys. Okay.

01:06:57.323 --> 01:06:59.981
- How you doing, Mark?
- Hey, John.

01:07:00.119 --> 01:07:02.018
Hey, Victor.
Thanks for coming, guys.

01:07:04.158 --> 01:07:06.263
I want you
guys to check this out.

01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:07.851
What's this?

01:07:09.887 --> 01:07:12.476
Look, I don't
see anything unusual.

01:07:12.614 --> 01:07:13.788
Same thing as last time.

01:07:13.926 --> 01:07:16.342
Right, look. Okay, I get that.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.551
You remember the guy
that ran Alisha off the road

01:07:18.689 --> 01:07:20.415
in his car, right?

01:07:20.553 --> 01:07:22.762
Okay, apparently this guy
was wearing a black hoodie.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.557
Look, so what?
We already investigated this.

01:07:24.695 --> 01:07:25.869
It's a false alarm.

01:07:26.007 --> 01:07:28.044
Keep watching, John.

01:07:28.182 --> 01:07:30.322
Okay, I made
a slight edit on the tape.

01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:33.497
You see that?

01:07:33.635 --> 01:07:35.879
This guy has been
circling our house, John.

01:07:36.017 --> 01:07:38.123
At least
seven to ten times.

01:07:38.261 --> 01:07:40.504
There's no
reports of him stopping nearby.

01:07:40.642 --> 01:07:42.610
This is not a coincidence.

01:07:42.748 --> 01:07:44.439
This guy is circling our house.

01:07:44.577 --> 01:07:46.924
- You do understand?
- Yeah. Yeah, we get it.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.892
We get it. You know what?

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.618
You may be onto something.

01:07:50.756 --> 01:07:52.309
We're gonna look into it.
All right?

01:07:52.447 --> 01:07:54.311
- I appreciate that.
-Don't worry. We got this.

01:07:54.449 --> 01:07:55.795
Okay. You got it, John.

01:07:55.933 --> 01:07:57.211
Thanks for coming again.

01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:58.729
- Victor, thank you.
- Okay.

01:08:11.811 --> 01:08:13.848
Hi.

01:08:13.986 --> 01:08:16.126
Hi, babe.
How you doing?

01:08:18.784 --> 01:08:20.268
Guess where I'm at.

01:08:22.063 --> 01:08:24.134
You're not close, are you?

01:08:24.272 --> 01:08:26.826
Well, I'll be outside
your door in five minutes.

01:08:26.964 --> 01:08:29.864
No, Stephen.
I have to tell my dad something.

01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:31.831
Come on, I'll be there
in five minutes. Don't worry.

01:08:31.969 --> 01:08:33.557
No, I have to tell...

01:08:35.732 --> 01:08:37.837
Oh, God.

01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:43.981
- Dad?
- Hey, what's up?

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.983
Well, Viola was--

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.020
Hold that thought,
just one second.

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:49.228
What's up?

01:08:49.366 --> 01:08:51.057
- Viola...
- Hold on!

01:08:51.196 --> 01:08:52.818
Yeah, what is it?

01:08:52.956 --> 01:08:54.302
Mark, you won't
believe this.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.510
Check this out.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:00.412
Jesus Christ

01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:02.241
We actually expected
a drug peddler to show up.

01:09:02.379 --> 01:09:04.278
But seeing the guest we have...

01:09:04.416 --> 01:09:06.176
The hotel has been seized
and he's under our radar.

01:09:06.314 --> 01:09:07.798
Do you want us to move in?

01:09:07.936 --> 01:09:09.800
No. You wait for me.
I'll be right there.

01:09:09.938 --> 01:09:11.388
Dad, well, I was
gonna tell you that...

01:09:11.526 --> 01:09:13.114
I'm gonna
be right back, okay?

01:09:13.252 --> 01:09:15.634
I'll be right back. Stay safe!

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.521
- Hey, Mark. How's it going?
- Hey, guys. What have we got?

01:09:42.695 --> 01:09:44.456
So, the word is,
he's up on the sixth floor.

01:09:44.594 --> 01:09:46.285
Room 623.

01:09:46.423 --> 01:09:47.942
We've got him
under surveillance.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.219
Doesn't know we're coming.

01:09:49.357 --> 01:09:50.979
- We good?
- We're good.

01:09:51.117 --> 01:09:52.947
We'll take the left stairs.
You guys take the right.

01:09:53.085 --> 01:09:55.121
We'll surveil the place.
Let's make it happen, let's go.

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:56.571
Let's go!

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.582
Come here!
Come here!

01:10:44.101 --> 01:10:45.413
Hey! Hey!

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:52.248
What the fuck?

01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.320
What? What is this? Who are you?

01:10:59.116 --> 01:11:00.773
If you don't
tell me what's going on,

01:11:00.911 --> 01:11:03.120
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your head right now.

01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:02.214
Come on, it's closed.

01:12:02.352 --> 01:12:03.664
Open it.

01:12:03.802 --> 01:12:05.251
You open it.

01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:06.943
I waited like seven years.

01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:08.738
You're gonna make me wait more?

01:12:08.876 --> 01:12:10.602
This door doesn't open.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:13.018
- Ah, really?
- You have to go to this one.

01:12:13.156 --> 01:12:15.020
Okay.

01:12:15.158 --> 01:12:16.366
I'm going.

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:23.856
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.898
I hate this show.

01:12:33.038 --> 01:12:36.179
I love you 'cause you're sexy.
But I hate this show.

01:12:36.317 --> 01:12:37.905
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:12:38.043 --> 01:12:39.838
Come on, baby, pick up.

01:12:39.976 --> 01:12:41.874
Come on! Pick up!

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:11.387
Oh, you caca.

01:13:15.943 --> 01:13:17.738
Oh, my effing phone.

01:13:17.876 --> 01:13:19.878
It's fucking dead.

01:13:20.016 --> 01:13:21.500
I'd better go
check on the family.

01:14:09.168 --> 01:14:11.343
This walk is too far.

01:14:12.862 --> 01:14:15.209
Just gonna have
to move in with them.

01:14:25.322 --> 01:14:27.048
Miriam!

01:14:27.186 --> 01:14:30.776
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
He's behind you, Miriam!

01:14:33.158 --> 01:14:35.816
Miriam, oh, Miriam!

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.313
Oh, my God...

01:14:51.245 --> 01:14:53.316
- Dad!
- Baby? Baby?

01:14:53.454 --> 01:14:55.249
Are you with me?
What's he doing?

01:14:55.387 --> 01:14:56.733
What's he doing?
Can you see him?

01:14:56.871 --> 01:14:59.529
Daddy... He's just...
He just...

01:14:59.667 --> 01:15:01.911
He just
killed Miriam.

01:15:02.049 --> 01:15:04.258
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid, you'll be fine.

01:15:04.396 --> 01:15:06.363
Okay? What's he doing right now?

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.848
Oh, my God!

01:15:07.986 --> 01:15:09.539
He killed Stephen too!

01:15:09.677 --> 01:15:12.059
He just killed him
right in front of me!

01:15:12.197 --> 01:15:13.405
Oh, no.
It's not gonna hold, baby.

01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:15.407
He's coming
in no matter what.

01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:17.443
He's coming in. Make your way
up to my bedroom, okay?

01:15:17.582 --> 01:15:19.722
Barricade the door.
Get some chairs.

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.586
Whatever you got.
Whatever is in there.

01:15:21.724 --> 01:15:23.070
Just wait for me, baby.

01:15:23.208 --> 01:15:25.175
I won't be long.

01:15:25.313 --> 01:15:26.487
Just remember something.

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:29.525
Kill or be killed.

01:16:10.289 --> 01:16:12.050
You're fucked!

01:16:17.055 --> 01:16:18.712
Shit!

01:16:25.511 --> 01:16:27.410
Come here...

01:16:34.693 --> 01:16:37.109
I'm gonna choke you out dead!

01:16:39.974 --> 01:16:43.806
But not yet, you little cunt!

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:52.746
- Hey, hey.
-Listen to me

01:16:52.884 --> 01:16:54.644
How you killed my family.

01:16:54.782 --> 01:16:57.267
Listen to me,
if you hurt my daughter...

01:16:57.405 --> 01:16:58.510
You know what?

01:16:58.648 --> 01:17:00.892
I enjoyed killing your wife.

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:03.308
If you hurt my daughter,
I am gonna blow up--

01:17:03.446 --> 01:17:05.137
Fuck yourself.

01:17:05.275 --> 01:17:07.174
You fucking hurt my daughter--

01:17:07.312 --> 01:17:10.660
Hey. Listen up.
Listen. Listen...

01:17:10.798 --> 01:17:12.075
I'm gonna fucking end you.

01:17:12.213 --> 01:17:13.249
Fucking listen to me!

01:17:13.387 --> 01:17:14.664
I am gonna end you!

01:17:14.802 --> 01:17:16.252
Boy, shut the fuck up.

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:18.150
I am gonna fucking
destroy you.

01:17:18.288 --> 01:17:22.465
Now listen to me kill
your little bitch fucking girl!

01:17:22.603 --> 01:17:23.846
Do not--

01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:07.303
I'm okay John.

01:18:07.441 --> 01:18:10.202
What about Alisha?
Is she gonna be all right?

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.308
She's gonna be fine.
She's a tough girl.

01:18:12.446 --> 01:18:14.620
Yeah. Well, she is your kid.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.728
Look, it's gonna take
a ton of paperwork

01:18:18.866 --> 01:18:20.419
- to get this mess cleaned up.
- Yeah.

01:18:20.557 --> 01:18:23.250
So, um... in the meantime...

01:18:25.045 --> 01:18:26.702
Go enjoy your summer.

01:18:36.573 --> 01:18:38.230
Remember, if you need anything

01:18:38.368 --> 01:18:40.094
just let me know, all right?

01:18:41.371 --> 01:18:42.718
Good to see you as always.

01:19:06.569 --> 01:19:08.329
So, this whole time

01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:10.918
you had a plan.

01:19:12.955 --> 01:19:14.680
What do you mean "had a plan"?

01:19:15.612 --> 01:19:17.028
The training?

01:19:17.166 --> 01:19:18.581
The martial art?

01:19:18.719 --> 01:19:20.065
Setting everything up?

01:19:21.618 --> 01:19:23.068
You know, to be honest,

01:19:25.346 --> 01:19:27.797
I would've started training you
no matter what.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:30.593
But yeah.

01:19:30.731 --> 01:19:32.043
There was a plan.

01:19:34.148 --> 01:19:35.736
Hey, love.

01:19:38.704 --> 01:19:40.499
Damn it, Mark.

01:19:40.637 --> 01:19:42.467
If you don't stop drinking
this shit it's gonna kill you.

01:19:42.605 --> 01:19:43.917
Yeah.

01:19:44.055 --> 01:19:46.091
You're right.

01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:49.163
You know,
after all these years, Miriam,

01:19:49.301 --> 01:19:50.751
chasing this guy,

01:19:50.889 --> 01:19:52.373
and I make no progress.

01:19:52.511 --> 01:19:54.790
I mean zero, nothing.
I just...

01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:56.999
Mark.

01:19:57.137 --> 01:19:58.448
Think about this.

01:19:58.586 --> 01:19:59.795
You've gotta put
the bait out there.

01:19:59.933 --> 01:20:01.072
Okay?

01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:03.384
Once he takes the bait,

01:20:03.522 --> 01:20:06.215
that's when you fucking pounce,
you get to kill him.

01:20:07.837 --> 01:20:10.460
And you protect family.
That's what it's all about.

01:20:12.462 --> 01:20:14.188
- Thanks Miriam.
-Yeah.

01:20:24.371 --> 01:20:25.993
It wasn't all me.

01:20:26.131 --> 01:20:28.996
You see, Miriam had a lot to do
with it as well.

01:20:31.067 --> 01:20:32.966
But I've gotta
tell you something else.

01:20:33.104 --> 01:20:37.039
What I started,
you finished pretty well.

01:20:37.177 --> 01:20:38.695
I'm not sure what that was.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.387
You were doing
some snake and crane.

01:20:40.525 --> 01:20:42.389
What was that? Huh?

01:20:48.222 --> 01:20:50.535
It's good to have you back.

01:20:51.467 --> 01:20:53.503
I missed you, Dad.

01:20:54.677 --> 01:20:56.230
I missed you too.
