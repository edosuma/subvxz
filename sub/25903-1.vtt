00:47.575 --> 00:48.641
Palle...

00:49.542 --> 00:50.783
it's very important

00:50.808 --> 00:55.150
that you follow the steps
of your spiritual progress.

00:55.158 --> 00:56.300
We...

00:56.301 --> 00:57.858
you and I...

00:58.259 --> 01:01.258
have a great mission.

01:01.283 --> 01:03.800
We shouldn't forget that.

01:04.950 --> 01:06.208
God...

01:06.850 --> 01:09.450
shall speak to us.

01:48.575 --> 01:50.050
Careful...

01:50.351 --> 01:52.433
my husband is a detective.

01:52.858 --> 01:55.625
We have to watch what we're doing.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.466
Strong kick.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.008
Wants out.

02:00.033 --> 02:02.566
What brings you here in
the middle of the day?

02:02.567 --> 02:05.107
I had to question a witness
down the street.

02:05.133 --> 02:08.633
Wanna help me with the
boxes in the store room?

02:08.699 --> 02:12.508
I have to go now, but
I can be back at five.

02:12.575 --> 02:14.241
Promises promises...

02:14.425 --> 02:15.925
I will.

02:18.750 --> 02:19.750
Hey...

02:35.866 --> 02:36.975
Fill it.

02:37.876 --> 02:39.108
Put your hands up.

02:39.533 --> 02:41.550
Come on.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.300
Stop the alarm.

02:51.891 --> 02:53.458
Don't move.

02:53.459 --> 02:54.300
Easy.

02:54.325 --> 02:57.425
I said... don't move.

03:00.591 --> 03:02.850
You! Fill the briefcase.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.875
I said... fill the briefcase.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.133
MOVE!

03:18.225 --> 03:20.825
Give me your bike.

03:21.700 --> 03:22.858
Don't...

03:22.882 --> 03:23.982
HEY...

03:26.658 --> 03:28.841
THAT'S MY BIKE!

03:42.950 --> 03:45.250
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

03:45.274 --> 03:46.274
CRAZY!

03:57.741 --> 03:59.100
Don't follow me.

03:59.524 --> 04:00.940
Get down.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.100
Don't shoot.

04:03.224 --> 04:04.824
Close your eyes.

04:10.475 --> 04:11.650
Please.

04:12.574 --> 04:14.874
Do not follow me.

04:18.583 --> 04:21.100
Keep your eyes closed.

04:47.241 --> 04:48.350
THAT WAY!

04:48.974 --> 04:51.549
THAT WAY, STAIRWAY TO THE RIGHT!

04:51.950 --> 04:53.008
This way.

04:53.132 --> 04:54.232
Be careful.

05:27.175 --> 05:29.208
Nice work boss.

05:29.432 --> 05:31.132
Right place at the right time.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.841
I bet it's the same guy
who robbed the bank last week.

05:53.908 --> 05:57.166
The sunglasses, the woolen cap

05:57.690 --> 06:00.365
the way he did it... it all adds up.

06:01.366 --> 06:05.633
But if he did the first robbery,
where's the money he took?

06:05.700 --> 06:08.550
Thuesen. Yes, he's here.

06:15.158 --> 06:17.225
Anders Olsen. My wife Marie...

06:17.849 --> 06:19.374
She fell down a ladder.

06:20.575 --> 06:23.258
Please...
- One moment please.

06:23.325 --> 06:26.425
Mr. Olsen.
- How is she?

06:26.491 --> 06:28.683
She will be fine.
- And the baby?

06:28.985 --> 06:30.685
Well...

07:24.441 --> 07:27.291
Can I get you anything?

07:28.108 --> 07:30.041
Nothing.

07:32.783 --> 07:35.800
Marie, I...
- I know.

07:44.700 --> 07:49.300
<i>Pardoned Nazi shoots
bank manager and clerk</i>

08:01.408 --> 08:02.700
Here you go.

08:03.824 --> 08:05.482
Local heroes.

08:05.783 --> 08:07.800
<i>Local heroes nab killer,
save lives, in bold action</i>

08:07.866 --> 08:11.050
Not me... so much for my heroism.

08:15.408 --> 08:19.341
Why do they have to mention he was a Nazi?

08:19.808 --> 08:22.133
What difference does it make?

08:22.657 --> 08:24.657
He still shot two people.

08:25.741 --> 08:27.950
People are dying...

08:28.474 --> 08:30.474
just like that.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.575
Here.

09:04.599 --> 09:06.199
Thank you.

09:13.691 --> 09:14.750
Sorry, boss.

09:15.774 --> 09:17.557
Yeah! really sorry.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.841
Thank you.

09:19.465 --> 09:22.265
But please, business as usual, okay?

09:23.366 --> 09:25.266
What do we know about our bank robber?

09:25.267 --> 09:28.507
Palle Hardrup, 28 years old

09:28.533 --> 09:30.166
toolmaker, married,

09:30.190 --> 09:33.232
sentenced in 1946 to prison for war crimes

09:33.233 --> 09:36.216
being part of our local Gestapo, the HIPO.

09:36.283 --> 09:38.966
In that case, he also has
friends in this building.

09:38.967 --> 09:40.007
Go on.

09:40.031 --> 09:42.532
Comes from a good family, modest means.

09:42.533 --> 09:44.308
He was paroled in 49

09:44.332 --> 09:46.474
employed by an oil company in 1950.

09:46.575 --> 09:48.675
He was studying to be an engineer.

09:48.741 --> 09:52.008
Then at his trial in 46 he said that he was

09:52.109 --> 09:56.749
motivated solely by the desire to
defend Denmark and secure its future.

09:56.775 --> 09:58.700
Is that why he robbed the bank

09:58.724 --> 10:00.540
to secure the future of Denmark?

10:00.541 --> 10:04.191
He claims that he did it so that
he could create a better society

10:04.192 --> 10:09.076
one where everyone would live in psychic
and psychologically balanced conditions.

10:09.077 --> 10:13.843
He wants to set up a Danish
National Communist Party.

10:15.466 --> 10:17.141
A lunatic.

10:17.165 --> 10:17.907
Yeah.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.525
And the other bank, any clues
where the money might be?

10:20.826 --> 10:23.965
No. He denies knowing anything about it.

10:23.991 --> 10:27.216
Alright. Let's go talk to his wife.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.983
I don't know anything about any money.

10:44.007 --> 10:45.949
Destroy everything if you want.

10:46.150 --> 10:49.341
You husband robbed two banks.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.600
He shot two people dead.

10:52.325 --> 10:55.425
This is serious.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.000
Could you open this door please?

11:07.750 --> 11:10.225
Hell's tears...

11:11.750 --> 11:14.675
Did your husband do all these drawings?

11:14.741 --> 11:15.900
Yes.

11:16.024 --> 11:18.524
He was studying engineering.

11:25.366 --> 11:31.716
<i>Official Uniforms to the Soldiers
of the New Nordic Spiritual Kingdom</i>

11:37.333 --> 11:40.966
We married shortly after Palle
was released from prison.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.483
Who are they?

11:42.507 --> 11:44.449
Friends of Palle

11:44.450 --> 11:46.050
from prison.

11:46.074 --> 11:47.574
I never liked them.

11:54.791 --> 11:58.516
He sketched everything... buildings

11:59.083 --> 12:02.850
parks, uniforms. The future.

12:02.916 --> 12:06.425
<i>The new Nordic Spiritual Kingdom,
a great spiritual, military and economic power</i>

12:06.491 --> 12:11.291
OK so this guy is a complete
nutcase, but damn he can draw.

12:34.958 --> 12:38.100
Did you discuss robbing the
'<i>Lands</i>' bank with anyone?

12:38.166 --> 12:39.800
No.

12:40.266 --> 12:43.233
And the other bank two weeks ago...

12:43.300 --> 12:44.425
was that you?

12:46.249 --> 12:47.490
I don't remember.

12:47.491 --> 12:49.791
Palle you weren't at work that day.

12:49.816 --> 12:51.157
Remember that?

12:51.158 --> 12:54.300
You've been in prison before, right?

12:54.366 --> 12:55.925
Right.

12:57.200 --> 13:02.050
You were sentenced in 1946
for collaborating with the enemy.

13:05.283 --> 13:12.783
National Socialism had a breath of
the old Viking tradition in modern form.

13:12.950 --> 13:15.808
Only by going back to what we once were

13:15.809 --> 13:20.117
can we develop traditional
harmony and power.

13:20.450 --> 13:25.425
The Nazis did evil things,
we know that now, but...

13:25.466 --> 13:29.625
but what they wanted... was
a strong society of equals.

13:31.991 --> 13:33.683
What do we have today?

13:33.750 --> 13:38.641
An indifferent society... without
aims, without equals, without...

13:38.708 --> 13:41.083
So you shot two innocent people

13:41.084 --> 13:45.141
just so you could raise the
money for your vision of equality.

13:45.466 --> 13:49.725
They didn't obey orders.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.050
If I hadn't shot them

13:51.374 --> 13:54.590
I would have betrayed God and his will

13:54.691 --> 13:59.616
and I would have been acting against society,
and humanity and the guardian angel.

14:04.083 --> 14:09.483
<i>Formed by the unity of its five nations,
the Nordic monarchy would be a mighty force</i>

14:09.550 --> 14:13.300
<i>able to weather all storms and adversities.</i>

14:13.501 --> 14:18.924
<i>Its ultimate task would be to disseminate
humanism throughout the world.</i>

14:19.450 --> 14:21.450
He couldn't have done
this alone. It's just...

14:21.451 --> 14:23.132
I just spoke with Hardrup's wife.

14:23.658 --> 14:28.175
So... now we have some information
about the four riders of the apocalypse.

14:28.241 --> 14:30.966
Four nut cases of Northern Monarchy.

14:31.033 --> 14:35.925
They were all in prison at the same time:
Palle, Mikael Jensen and Ole Mortensen.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.291
The fourth one she couldn't remember.

14:38.692 --> 14:40.074
Couldn't remember?

14:40.100 --> 14:44.341
She said he just showed up
at the wedding uninvited.

14:44.408 --> 14:46.475
He's on the wedding photo?

14:46.900 --> 14:48.140
Don't know.

14:48.241 --> 14:53.091
Jensen moved to the America and
Mortensen runs the club. The Pink Dragon.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.675
The Pink Dragon... that's a brothel.

14:57.733 --> 14:58.883
What?

15:23.825 --> 15:25.800
LOCK THE DOORS!

15:32.141 --> 15:33.908
STAIRWAY!

15:37.783 --> 15:40.050
He went over there!

15:40.908 --> 15:44.175
No, he's not here.
- SHUT UP!

15:45.866 --> 15:48.091
GET UP!

15:48.158 --> 15:50.883
GET UP! NOW!
- Don't shoot!

15:52.375 --> 15:55.675
I thought you were someone I owed money to.

15:55.741 --> 15:59.983
Didn't realize you were police officers.
- No thank you.

16:00.933 --> 16:05.075
I have nothing but respect for the police.

16:05.341 --> 16:07.650
Do you know this man?

16:10.866 --> 16:14.233
Look... I had nothing to
do with that bank job.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.674
I haven't seen Palle since
that picture was taken.

16:16.700 --> 16:19.108
Did you know Hardrup before
you met him in prison?

16:19.109 --> 16:21.449
No. We but we were in
the same cell for a while.

16:21.575 --> 16:24.591
And the guy next to you?

16:27.033 --> 16:29.966
Bjørn Schouw Nielsen.

16:30.033 --> 16:32.758
The fucking pendulum.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.983
That's what they called him.

16:34.984 --> 16:36.824
He sold Jews for his freedom.

16:36.950 --> 16:39.425
Back in the war he had a
fight with a German officer

16:39.526 --> 16:42.265
ended up shooting the
guy over some girl.

16:42.491 --> 16:44.291
The Germans got hold of him

16:44.692 --> 16:48.674
and he asked them to
take him to the Gestapo.

16:48.700 --> 16:52.591
Then he told them about these
Jews trying to escape to Sweden.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.466
The Germans got all of them.

16:56.533 --> 17:00.491
Later, he betrayed the Germans too.

17:01.491 --> 17:05.425
There's no money here, but...

17:06.348 --> 17:08.940
there's a lot of other weird stuff.

17:09.441 --> 17:12.125
Keep looking.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.133
Anyway, Palle and Nielsen
wanted me out of the cell.

17:17.599 --> 17:19.790
They both got into that...

17:19.815 --> 17:22.098
weird Eastern philosophy stuff.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.090
Spooky... you know.

17:27.116 --> 17:31.091
Palle changed. Totally. He was
like... like a different person like...

17:31.158 --> 17:33.025
like someone in a daze.

17:33.949 --> 17:35.190
A daze?

17:35.191 --> 17:37.300
You know, like... what do they call it?

17:38.424 --> 17:39.924
A trance.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.700
Is it the bank robbery?

17:58.224 --> 17:59.624
Yes

18:01.866 --> 18:05.050
and somehow it gets under my skin.

18:30.866 --> 18:33.425
Are you spying on me?

18:35.866 --> 18:38.883
Maybe I ought to.

18:41.283 --> 18:45.341
I guess this did not turn out
to be such a happy marriage.

18:50.241 --> 18:52.925
More on Nielsen.

18:53.391 --> 18:56.283
Age 14 thrown out by father.

18:56.350 --> 18:59.700
Age 16 first jail sentence.

19:00.224 --> 19:02.715
Assault, drunk, disorderly.

19:03.116 --> 19:08.091
He was a member of a
psychological research society.

19:08.158 --> 19:12.425
<i>The study of psychological
and extra-sensory phenomena</i>

19:12.791 --> 19:14.591
<i>and hypnosis.</i>

19:14.700 --> 19:15.733
Petersen...

19:16.157 --> 19:19.699
I want all the information you can find
about this psychological research group

19:19.700 --> 19:22.925
and who led it... and find Nielsen.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.691
He's down here.

19:40.782 --> 19:42.782
Do you want to wait
outside or talk to him now?

19:46.108 --> 19:47.958
Now.

19:48.783 --> 19:49.958
Mr. Nielsen.

19:50.059 --> 19:53.132
Breathe on it and you're a dead man.

19:53.658 --> 19:55.641
On second thoughts...

19:59.950 --> 20:01.525
You look familiar

20:01.626 --> 20:03.900
but you are not a regular?

20:03.926 --> 20:04.665
No.

20:04.691 --> 20:08.666
I know the papers! I've seen your picture.

20:08.733 --> 20:11.825
You're somebody famous... locally.

20:12.226 --> 20:14.865
You wouldn't refuse
a drink, would you?

20:14.891 --> 20:17.283
Roland, give a round
of beer for everybody.

20:17.350 --> 20:21.200
We would like to ask you a few questions...

20:22.783 --> 20:24.558
if you don't mind.

20:25.082 --> 20:27.582
Do you recognize this man?

20:31.908 --> 20:34.133
My old friend

20:34.200 --> 20:36.883
Palle, the bank robber.

20:36.950 --> 20:38.225
Do you still keep in touch?

20:38.749 --> 20:39.990
Now and then.

20:39.991 --> 20:42.750
He's been in pretty bad shape lately.

20:42.851 --> 20:45.715
Somebody really ought to take care of him.

20:45.741 --> 20:49.841
We have a warrant to search your home.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.466
<i>Fanfare of the new

21:29.450 --> 21:32.050
<i>Rules and regulations of

21:35.450 --> 21:37.800
There's no money.

21:45.825 --> 21:49.175
Is he the bank robber's partner?

21:49.241 --> 21:52.300
I don't know, perhaps.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.341
Maybe you could let me help you.

22:02.042 --> 22:04.949
My brain really needs something to do...

22:05.575 --> 22:07.575
What about the bookshop?

22:07.799 --> 22:11.699
and a way to forget.

22:13.825 --> 22:16.591
It's confidential.

22:23.575 --> 22:26.025
We started with breathing exercises

22:26.026 --> 22:28.465
and progressed to various yoga techniques

22:28.491 --> 22:33.425
such as Raja yoga, Hatha yoga,
Bhakti yoga and finally Karma yoga.

22:33.491 --> 22:38.758
Our objective was divine,
para-cosmic enlightenment

22:38.783 --> 22:44.633
in which yoga was a tool in the process
of purification of the body and soul.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.308
Our?

22:46.907 --> 22:49.907
Mine and Schouw Nielsen's.

23:12.833 --> 23:14.741
Can I help you?

23:14.808 --> 23:18.575
Yes. I'm looking for your
section on Eastern philosophy.

23:19.741 --> 23:21.800
Right this way.

23:23.191 --> 23:25.083
Here we are.

23:26.783 --> 23:32.041
Interesting to meet someone who cares
about Eastern philosophy, it's not so usual.

23:32.408 --> 23:35.216
Does this interest you as well?

23:35.283 --> 23:38.258
Four years of philosophy studies behind me.

23:38.882 --> 23:40.782
Only a few courses away from my degree.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.641
Wonderful!

23:42.765 --> 23:45.307
It seems we have much
to share with each other.

23:45.408 --> 23:48.258
Can we get him to give us any real answers?

23:48.325 --> 23:53.216
Schizophrenic deterioration produces
para-cosmic delusions in him.

23:53.283 --> 23:56.675
In his state of mind, I really doubt it.

23:57.241 --> 24:00.800
What about the yoga and his
mental practice with Nielsen?

24:00.825 --> 24:04.591
Mortensen said that Hardrup
was in some kind of trance.

24:04.700 --> 24:08.216
Could he have been under hypnosis
when he carried out the robberies?

24:08.283 --> 24:12.675
Neither forensics nor medical
science has recognized that

24:12.741 --> 24:16.425
a crime can be committed
under the effect of hypnosis

24:16.491 --> 24:20.216
and that the process can
be forgotten. It's impossible.

24:37.266 --> 24:40.491
Did you really talk to Nielsen?

24:42.100 --> 24:43.250
He was...

24:44.074 --> 24:46.457
I don't know... fascinating.

24:46.858 --> 24:49.966
It's really hard to believe
he's part of the crime.

24:50.033 --> 24:51.425
He's a former Nazi.

24:51.449 --> 24:54.890
He had this strange connection
with Hardrup in prison

24:54.991 --> 24:57.791
where they would practice
yoga and meditation.

24:57.815 --> 25:00.157
Normally those things have
a positive effect on the mind.

25:00.158 --> 25:01.266
He's dangerous.

25:01.290 --> 25:03.932
I might be able to get
something out of him.

25:04.033 --> 25:07.591
I think you should stay away
from him from now on.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.000
What if he knows who you are?

25:09.008 --> 25:11.008
Maybe he does!

25:22.033 --> 25:26.133
<i>Warsaw University
Doctor of Psychiatry</i>

25:43.033 --> 25:44.450
You saw his smile?

25:44.474 --> 25:47.115
He is freed from his fear of death

25:47.416 --> 25:50.600
which prevented him from sleeping.

25:52.033 --> 25:56.258
I needed to treat this patient
through his past life.

26:00.450 --> 26:02.616
Do you believe in past lives?

26:02.640 --> 26:03.982
Young man...

26:04.283 --> 26:06.058
I don't believe in anything.

26:06.082 --> 26:08.682
I use whatever works.

26:08.783 --> 26:14.050
There is no point in solving
philosophical and religious problems

26:14.116 --> 26:17.341
when someone's well-being is at stake.

26:17.408 --> 26:21.258
Do you always overwhelm strangers
with information about your patients?

26:21.325 --> 26:26.925
Only those police who seek enlightenment
about the mysteries of manipulation.

26:26.991 --> 26:29.633
So, what is troubling you?

26:29.657 --> 26:32.015
Would you like to take a seat?

26:32.116 --> 26:33.483
No this is not about me.

26:33.607 --> 26:35.249
You never know.

26:35.950 --> 26:39.883
I'm here because of work,
not to be hypnotized.

26:39.950 --> 26:43.191
Could you please tell me about
your psychological research group?

26:43.315 --> 26:45.057
What was its purpose?

26:45.158 --> 26:48.675
To create new viewpoints to people.

26:48.741 --> 26:55.550
We also did some experiments related to
meditation, hypnosis and out-of-body experience.

26:56.158 --> 26:59.550
Do you remember this
person from your group?

27:00.700 --> 27:02.133
Yes I do.

27:02.557 --> 27:06.357
He was very eager to learn everything.

27:11.533 --> 27:17.591
Aboriginal people use trances,
which are a kind of... stage of hypnosis.

27:17.700 --> 27:21.800
For them it is connected to
healing and seeing deeper.

27:21.825 --> 27:30.316
It is said that thousands of years ago certain tribes
performed complicated brain surgery using hypnosis.

27:30.340 --> 27:32.982
Miracle, isn't it?

27:33.183 --> 27:40.050
It's generally accepted that no one acts contrary
to their own moral codes... even under hypnosis.

27:40.058 --> 27:45.866
So you're saying you cannot hypnotize
a person to commit robbery or to kill?

27:48.033 --> 27:50.100
I didn't say that.

27:50.141 --> 27:55.983
People often act in the name
of religion, belief, patriotism.

27:57.150 --> 28:00.991
We were taught these values
from the time we were children.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.733
That is also hypnosis, inspector.

28:06.900 --> 28:11.866
For some people's morale codes
can be exploited, circumvented.

28:11.950 --> 28:14.750
Immoral things become moral.

28:15.758 --> 28:18.658
That's what many leaders do...

28:18.725 --> 28:24.408
use idealistic goals to get people
to act on their most basic habits.

28:26.658 --> 28:29.383
Let's see how it goes.

28:38.825 --> 28:42.741
He's agreed to cooperate.

28:46.700 --> 28:49.758
Doctor Dabrowski.

28:50.083 --> 28:52.433
Palle Hardrup.

28:55.991 --> 28:59.091
We are now moving back through time.

29:05.366 --> 29:10.300
Until the time when you were in
'Horsens' prison after the war.

29:12.866 --> 29:15.633
Back to your cell.

29:17.450 --> 29:20.383
You are now in that time...

29:20.750 --> 29:23.100
in that moment.

29:27.950 --> 29:30.925
Breathe slowly...

29:30.991 --> 29:33.508
in and out.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.558
Tell me where are you now...

29:37.582 --> 29:39.682
and what year is it?

29:44.966 --> 29:46.683
In prison...

29:47.107 --> 29:49.207
in my cell...

29:49.208 --> 29:51.433
it's 1947.

29:52.366 --> 29:55.258
Is there anyone else in your cell?

29:57.075 --> 29:58.100
No...

29:59.224 --> 30:01.774
I'm alone at the moment.

30:02.075 --> 30:04.550
How do you feel?

30:06.900 --> 30:08.383
Good...

30:09.307 --> 30:10.449
comfortable.

30:10.850 --> 30:14.758
Do you have any plans
for when you leave prison?

30:14.783 --> 30:16.966
I have a great mission.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.690
Tell me about this mission.

30:29.116 --> 30:32.925
Does this mission have anything
with to do the new party?

30:34.625 --> 30:35.625
Yes

30:35.649 --> 30:39.574
but I'm not allowed to talk about it

30:39.575 --> 30:42.633
the guardian angel forbids it.

30:44.991 --> 30:46.575
The guardian angel?

30:46.699 --> 30:49.665
Yes, he forbids it.

30:50.366 --> 30:54.050
You want to tell me about it... now.

30:54.116 --> 30:56.633
I can't. I can't.

30:58.116 --> 31:00.633
You can Palle

31:00.700 --> 31:05.841
you are at complete liberty to talk about it

31:05.908 --> 31:08.633
you have permission.

31:10.991 --> 31:12.900
What does he look like?

31:12.901 --> 31:15.600
NO, I can't...

31:16.325 --> 31:19.841
He protects me.

31:19.908 --> 31:24.816
He protects me. I can't.
I must... I must go away.

31:28.741 --> 31:33.550
We're coming back from there,
from that time, from that moment.

31:34.658 --> 31:38.216
You can feel yourself... your mind relaxing.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.175
We are returning to the present now...

31:45.283 --> 31:47.466
till this moment.

31:48.283 --> 31:53.133
It seems there is a lock in Hardrup's mind

31:54.825 --> 31:57.008
that I can not break.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.974
What do you mean 'a lock'?

31:59.075 --> 32:04.258
Someone has placed a block there
and it's linked to a person or a code.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.508
The guardian angel?

32:07.575 --> 32:11.675
Hardrup's mind will only
accept a certain user

32:11.741 --> 32:17.091
and the code is there to maintain
the effect, the suggestion.

32:17.908 --> 32:18.925
A code?

32:19.049 --> 32:20.490
Yes.

32:20.791 --> 32:24.266
It could be a sign, a memory, a voice

32:24.333 --> 32:27.266
something which maintains
the state of trance.

32:27.333 --> 32:30.933
You think he's being
manipulated? Hypnotized?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.191
Apparently, yes.

32:33.215 --> 32:36.457
Can we find another way
to break this lock?

32:36.658 --> 32:40.550
Are you asking me to help
you solve this case?

32:42.908 --> 32:46.800
I get to use the material
for my personal research.

32:46.825 --> 32:50.841
I'm allowed to film the experiments.

32:50.908 --> 32:56.341
You get to manipulate and use me
if you let me do the same to you.

33:06.241 --> 33:10.341
Ah! Max Dabrowski, the Great Bonzini.

33:10.408 --> 33:13.758
and the infamous police interrogator.

33:13.783 --> 33:17.841
I hear you graduated to selling popcorn.

33:17.908 --> 33:20.391
Yes, would you want to try some?

33:20.415 --> 33:22.157
Psychology put into practice.

33:22.158 --> 33:25.633
Taste the way of life of Hollywood.

33:26.450 --> 33:28.466
Too salty.

33:30.450 --> 33:34.425
Your henchmen dragged me down
here away from one of my customers.

33:34.491 --> 33:38.175
Is it your intention to destroy
my honorable business?

33:38.241 --> 33:40.841
Do you know what this is?

33:40.908 --> 33:45.758
Are you joking? It's a popular model.
Had one myself just like it. It was stolen.

33:45.783 --> 33:47.133
I reported it to the police.

33:47.157 --> 33:50.499
It is <i>your</i> bicycle.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.933
We found it close to the
bank Palle Hardrup robbed.

33:56.241 --> 33:59.883
I'm surprised he would take it from me.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.808
It is a shame...

34:01.832 --> 34:05.765
to be betrayed by a friend.

34:05.866 --> 34:07.525
What are you doing?

34:07.549 --> 34:10.248
It's just for my own collection.

34:12.033 --> 34:16.132
You and Hardrup were in the
same cell in prison, right?

34:16.199 --> 34:17.882
Yes.

34:17.949 --> 34:20.841
Says in the report you two
practiced yoga there.

34:20.908 --> 34:26.382
We did whatever we could to
endure the difficult circumstances.

34:27.083 --> 34:27.650
OK!

34:27.675 --> 34:30.300
What is the New Nordic Kingdom?

34:30.366 --> 34:34.632
Because we found material
relating to that in both your houses.

34:34.699 --> 34:39.091
Those were Hardrup's strange
imaginations, not mine.

34:39.158 --> 34:44.925
But I must say those thoughts did
seem to keep him stable in prison.

34:45.949 --> 34:49.925
We also used other forms of
spiritual evolution together.

34:49.991 --> 34:52.100
What about hypnosis?

34:53.024 --> 34:56.498
Did you ever use that
in your spiritual evolution?

34:56.699 --> 34:59.383
Not as such, but...

34:59.450 --> 35:04.091
whichever method he's
chosen one must be careful.

35:04.158 --> 35:07.883
Balance is essential
to personal development.

35:10.158 --> 35:14.883
Is your history of assault also
essential to your personal development?

35:19.116 --> 35:22.800
Lambs sometimes stray from the fold

35:22.825 --> 35:28.883
but even those who stray have
the right to seek the light of love.

35:29.725 --> 35:31.050
Lock him up.

35:31.116 --> 35:33.841
And... here is Dabrowski's book.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.207
Thank you.

35:35.208 --> 35:38.966
Does he suspect somebody used
hypnosis in the bank robbery?

35:39.033 --> 35:40.041
Maybe.

35:40.065 --> 35:41.807
Who... Nielsen?

35:42.408 --> 35:43.425
Yes.

35:43.491 --> 35:46.075
Nobody's ever carried
away a crime like that.

35:46.399 --> 35:48.640
We don't know that, can't know.

35:48.741 --> 35:51.591
But how pure are Dabrowski's motives?

35:51.700 --> 35:55.808
Maybe he's wants to make history try to
prove something that nobody can understand.

35:55.875 --> 35:58.966
I read that he used to
be an old stage hypnotist.

35:59.033 --> 36:02.258
You should consider...
- Marie, please.

36:03.933 --> 36:06.325
See you at home.

36:08.283 --> 36:09.883
Two...

36:10.783 --> 36:12.800
three...

36:12.866 --> 36:14.966
four...

36:17.783 --> 36:20.883
and you are completely relaxed...

36:20.950 --> 36:22.675
peaceful.

36:22.899 --> 36:24.640
Five...

36:24.741 --> 36:28.133
you're falling deeper into dream.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.925
Ten.

36:33.991 --> 36:37.841
You're back in prison in 1947.

36:39.316 --> 36:42.025
You can see the place

36:42.649 --> 36:46.249
and also who are around of you

36:46.908 --> 36:51.258
and you will see and hear how
the guardian angel will talk to you.

36:58.325 --> 37:01.925
You will see and hear him now.

37:24.950 --> 37:28.050
We still have some unanswered questions

37:28.116 --> 37:31.883
that's why I invited Doctor Dabrowski.

37:32.908 --> 37:38.175
And your... mumbo jumbo tests
can answer these questions?

37:38.641 --> 37:40.200
Yes.

37:40.924 --> 37:45.374
Someone has put a lock
into Hardrup's mind.

37:45.575 --> 37:47.383
A lock?

37:49.075 --> 37:53.466
And is the only unanswered question

37:53.533 --> 37:55.466
is where is the money

37:56.090 --> 37:59.199
otherwise the case is clear.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.983
You have nothing on Nielsen

38:03.007 --> 38:05.107
so release him.

38:11.700 --> 38:14.791
You can collect your clothing and
personal belongings on your way out.

38:14.815 --> 38:16.315
You're free to go.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.466
I know you're behind this...

38:27.241 --> 38:29.841
and I am going to prove it.

38:29.908 --> 38:35.633
You and your great Bonzini
can't prove a damn thing.

38:52.116 --> 38:54.325
You are...

38:54.649 --> 38:55.890
a chicken

38:55.991 --> 38:59.216
and you want to talk to your friends.

39:01.908 --> 39:06.425
You are in a deep, deep trance.

39:06.491 --> 39:09.633
You have... a fever.

39:10.457 --> 39:12.199
You're hot.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.466
You have to get get rid of your feathers.

39:26.825 --> 39:28.783
Glad to see that everyone is working hard.

39:28.807 --> 39:30.449
Anders we were... just...

39:30.450 --> 39:32.191
OK.

39:33.392 --> 39:34.132
Sorry.

39:34.158 --> 39:38.883
We're continuing with the Nielsen lead
no matter how funny you all find it.

39:38.950 --> 39:41.633
Boss we still haven't
got any solid evidence.

39:41.657 --> 39:43.199
You sound like Thuesen.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.350
We'll find evidence and
we'll show it to him.

39:46.174 --> 39:48.157
That's our job.

39:48.658 --> 39:50.150
So this one interests you.

39:50.751 --> 39:52.508
Thank you.

39:52.533 --> 39:56.175
My friend has committed a horrible crime.

39:56.241 --> 40:01.591
The police think that I'm involved
in this crime which is linked to hypnosis

40:03.491 --> 40:05.791
So it will be a good time to learn more

40:05.815 --> 40:09.457
to understand what the
police are trying to prove.

40:10.658 --> 40:13.258
Four kroner.

40:14.116 --> 40:15.808
But you know about this

40:16.532 --> 40:18.765
through your husband

40:18.866 --> 40:20.966
Something...

40:23.475 --> 40:26.091
but did you do it?

40:26.158 --> 40:28.725
Some people have a
natural calling for evil.

40:28.749 --> 40:32.165
Hardrup has gone the wrong direction.

40:32.866 --> 40:34.600
I blame myself.

40:35.524 --> 40:38.424
I wasn't there to rescue him.

40:56.075 --> 40:57.566
In hypnosis

40:58.390 --> 41:01.457
you can set locks in the mind

41:02.158 --> 41:06.175
to make a person think in only one zone

41:08.575 --> 41:12.008
or, you can open new connections

41:12.132 --> 41:15.499
remove blocks and frustrations.

41:16.700 --> 41:19.050
Right here.

41:19.991 --> 41:24.466
It's all a question of
skill and responsibility.

41:24.533 --> 41:26.550
A tool for good...

41:27.974 --> 41:30.182
or evil!

41:30.783 --> 41:35.600
In Poland, I used to help my
friend who was a police officer.

41:35.666 --> 41:41.425
Through hypnosis, we could get witnesses
to return to the scene of the crime

41:41.491 --> 41:46.883
in their minds and remember
insignificant details more clearly.

41:47.450 --> 41:51.633
They were able to stop their
memories in a precise given moment

41:51.700 --> 41:55.133
and identify the guilty one.

41:56.533 --> 42:01.508
It worked well, but then,
one witness faked his trance

42:02.200 --> 42:06.633
and named an innocent person
in order to protect the real criminal.

42:06.700 --> 42:09.333
You lost your reputation then?

42:09.357 --> 42:10.899
I fucked up!

42:11.200 --> 42:14.633
because of one little detail

42:14.700 --> 42:18.841
all our research was turned into a farce.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.775
Your father was a police officer?

42:30.399 --> 42:32.199
Yes...

42:34.783 --> 42:37.800
and a friend of Thuesen.

42:37.825 --> 42:42.591
Is there something you want to
talk about regarding your father?

42:46.783 --> 42:50.216
Let's not talk about my nightmares.

43:57.166 --> 43:58.775
Palle...

43:59.199 --> 44:02.474
the guardian angel wishes to speak to you.

44:02.575 --> 44:04.658
He will use this body

44:05.182 --> 44:08.657
to transform his speech.

44:08.658 --> 44:13.133
You are chosen as the founder
of the Northern Monarchy

44:13.200 --> 44:20.133
the herald and vanguard
for all spiritual thinking.

44:20.241 --> 44:22.841
You will become a great leader

44:22.908 --> 44:28.841
with an important mission which
Bjørn Schouw Nielsen will also uphold.

44:30.866 --> 44:34.425
All of your failings are erased.

44:35.741 --> 44:39.133
You are under God's wing now.

45:35.950 --> 45:38.466
I saw you were awake.

45:40.866 --> 45:43.550
Mind if we talk?

45:43.974 --> 45:45.982
No.

45:47.083 --> 45:48.758
You know...

45:48.782 --> 45:52.082
I have trouble sleeping too.

45:55.983 --> 45:57.666
It's no wonder.

45:57.690 --> 46:00.399
Our unbalanced world
can affect us in many...

46:01.124 --> 46:02.899
disturbing ways.

46:03.700 --> 46:05.983
but when the mind...

46:06.108 --> 46:08.349
is purified...

46:08.750 --> 46:10.433
and you stand...

46:10.658 --> 46:13.099
at the foot of the holy mountain

46:13.200 --> 46:17.133
you can feel the breath
of divinity fall on you

46:18.350 --> 46:21.616
and all else loses its meaning.

46:25.408 --> 46:27.233
They tried to scare me...

46:28.357 --> 46:30.507
about Schouw Nielsen.

46:30.908 --> 46:34.133
They wondered about our friendship...

46:35.866 --> 46:40.175
but we were the only ones who
sought the truth within ourselves.

46:43.950 --> 46:46.883
Why didn't you shoot me?

46:49.158 --> 46:51.491
You obeyed the orders.

46:51.493 --> 46:55.967
You did not step up against the
guardian angel's and God's will.

46:55.991 --> 46:58.091
You obeyed.

47:02.241 --> 47:05.383
Who is the guardian angel?

47:07.325 --> 47:09.800
He's a messenger from God.

47:11.241 --> 47:13.341
Is he here?

47:21.283 --> 47:24.633
Does he protect you?

47:26.291 --> 47:29.391
The guardian angel protects my family, yes.

48:37.933 --> 48:40.825
Sorry. I have to go.

48:44.525 --> 48:46.308
Will you be home for dinner?

48:46.709 --> 48:48.749
Things are rather busy at work.

48:49.075 --> 48:50.466
By the way...

48:51.267 --> 48:53.307
Nielsen came by the bookshop again.

48:54.533 --> 48:55.141
What?

48:55.142 --> 48:58.182
We had a right interesting
talk. He knows I'm your wife.

48:58.208 --> 48:59.975
This is crazy! He's manipulating you.

49:00.176 --> 49:03.715
Maybe... or then there's the
other possibility that he's innocent.

49:03.741 --> 49:04.816
You mustn’t talk to him.

49:04.817 --> 49:08.257
We talk to our customers.
Should I just turn my back on him?

49:08.283 --> 49:12.633
I shouldn't have told you
anything! I'm an idiot!

49:12.700 --> 49:15.341
You're not to see him!

49:19.991 --> 49:23.033
Here's the list of all the people
who came to visit Hardrup.

49:23.758 --> 49:24.899
It's only two names on it

49:25.500 --> 49:27.758
that's Nielsen and Hardrup's wife Bente

49:27.983 --> 49:29.824
and she only visited him once.

49:29.825 --> 49:33.300
There's also several letters from Nielsen

49:33.558 --> 49:34.550
OK!

49:34.551 --> 49:36.090
But it doesn't prove anything.

49:36.115 --> 49:38.415
I want to see those letters.

49:38.516 --> 49:40.600
We searched the cell, didn't find anything.

49:40.601 --> 49:43.840
Logical. He destroys them.

49:43.866 --> 49:47.800
From now on, all letters to
Hardrup pass through us.

49:47.807 --> 49:49.007
Right.

49:50.533 --> 49:53.216
Coffee and pastries.

49:53.283 --> 49:57.091
Susi used to work for the signal
corps in Sweden during the war.

49:57.116 --> 49:58.099
Terrific!

49:58.100 --> 50:00.950
Back to the typewriter.

50:01.825 --> 50:03.483
Are you going into a trance again?

50:03.508 --> 50:04.749
Almost.

50:05.250 --> 50:07.475
Just keep your trousers on, ok?

50:08.841 --> 50:12.000
Why not put Nielsen and Hardrup
in the same room together

50:12.005 --> 50:14.245
question them and see what happens?

50:14.266 --> 50:16.925
Excellent. I want to film it.

50:16.991 --> 50:19.508
I made all the mistakes.

50:19.575 --> 50:25.341
I stole... even killed a German soldier.

50:25.408 --> 50:30.925
But the hardest part for me is getting
past how I betrayed my Jewish friends.

50:38.083 --> 50:39.983
I was lucky.

50:41.108 --> 50:42.549
No one betrayed us

50:42.550 --> 50:47.441
we were able to avoid the camps and
my family got here safely after the war.

50:48.741 --> 50:55.175
I don't know if it was my evil nature or
the sum total of my childhood traumas

50:55.241 --> 51:00.091
but all this self-improvement
like yoga and meditation

51:00.158 --> 51:04.466
has helped bring me
closer to my inner light.

51:09.200 --> 51:14.216
This hasn't been the most
balanced time for me.

51:14.283 --> 51:17.891
My emotions go up and
down. You know we...

51:18.616 --> 51:21.316
we just had a tragedy...

51:23.991 --> 51:26.966
we lost our child.

51:29.491 --> 51:32.383
I am so sorry to hear that.

51:36.475 --> 51:37.966
So...

51:38.291 --> 51:40.065
no smoking...

51:40.366 --> 51:42.200
what about alcohol?

51:42.201 --> 51:43.324
Alcohol?

51:43.325 --> 51:47.125
Are you balanced with that?

51:51.783 --> 51:55.266
That part could still use some development.

51:55.267 --> 51:56.924
Oh!

51:56.950 --> 52:01.841
Sometimes a glass of
wine can clarify the mind.

52:01.908 --> 52:06.550
In the middle of the day?
- Especially in the middle of the day.

52:08.825 --> 52:11.316
Shall we?

52:13.541 --> 52:15.041
Why not!

52:27.475 --> 52:29.491
The food is getting cold.

52:29.500 --> 52:34.100
Have you been waiting for me?

52:35.333 --> 52:38.225
It looks very nice.

52:38.491 --> 52:42.508
I'm so sorry that we had
such a bad start this morning.

52:42.866 --> 52:45.675
It's OK.

52:50.783 --> 52:53.008
Have you been drinking?

52:53.908 --> 52:58.633
With my colleagues after
work. A glass of wine.

52:58.700 --> 53:02.966
Also I met my... professor.

53:04.450 --> 53:07.883
We talked about my graduation.
- Over wine?

53:07.950 --> 53:11.341
Just one glass.

53:13.283 --> 53:15.216
Cheers.

53:26.950 --> 53:30.341
Good afternoon, Palle.
- Good afternoon.

53:37.450 --> 53:41.758
What did you do with the money
from the first bank you robbed?

53:46.700 --> 53:53.650
Palle, did it ever occur to you that your friend Bjorn was
using hypnosis on you while you were together in prison?

53:56.866 --> 53:59.133
Sorry for the interruption.

53:59.950 --> 54:04.800
Hardrup has already confessed
and he said he did it alone.

54:13.200 --> 54:16.383
Why can't you trust me?
What are you scared of?

54:16.850 --> 54:20.841
Why don't you see it yourself you
are being manipulated by this Polish...

54:20.908 --> 54:22.091
Polish what?

54:22.092 --> 54:26.299
Say it! I'm not hunting
you and nazis anymore!

54:26.300 --> 54:29.066
Anders I'm concerned
about your fucking health!

54:30.491 --> 54:32.966
Sorry.

54:33.033 --> 54:37.675
I know you've had people
watching me. Including Petersen.

54:38.575 --> 54:42.800
Four days. Max.
Wrap this up

54:43.991 --> 54:46.925
then the case is closed.

54:54.283 --> 54:59.758
The law allows me to hold you for questioning
for as long as the investigation continues.

55:05.975 --> 55:09.366
It continues until you talk.

55:32.283 --> 55:34.508
Long day, huh?

55:35.908 --> 55:38.841
One drink, for the road?

55:40.658 --> 55:43.091
Why not!

55:43.158 --> 55:46.550
but this time... at my place.

55:55.450 --> 55:58.425
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

56:01.700 --> 56:03.758
Wow!

56:10.658 --> 56:11.791
Do you want some cake?

56:12.316 --> 56:14.732
Yes please.

56:15.533 --> 56:18.075
So you didn't invite Thuesen?

56:18.600 --> 56:21.200
He's not a friend of mine either.

56:25.783 --> 56:29.966
You know I respect you more
than any other police investigator

56:30.033 --> 56:34.425
but in this case, whether
you are right or wrong...

56:34.491 --> 56:37.841
this will never succeed in court.

56:38.700 --> 56:42.508
Hypnosis, Anders... Dabrowski!

56:43.866 --> 56:46.675
it's too weird.

56:47.141 --> 56:50.491
I'm telling you this as a friend.

56:51.325 --> 56:55.175
Thank you for the birthday.

57:03.791 --> 57:07.641
You know lack of evidence isn't the problem.

57:07.708 --> 57:12.850
There are plenty of officers who create the evidence
they need when they know someone is guilty.

58:09.683 --> 58:11.266
Mrs. Hardrup.

58:12.691 --> 58:14.682
I see I came at a busy time.

58:15.083 --> 58:17.225
Are you moving far?

58:17.250 --> 58:18.490
Near here

58:18.491 --> 58:20.341
about half the size.

58:21.666 --> 58:24.407
Would you mind answering
just a few questions?

58:24.408 --> 58:28.341
I knew Nielsen before I met Palle.

58:28.491 --> 58:33.466
It was his idea that Palle and I should
meet when Palle got out of prison...

58:33.533 --> 58:35.800
and get married.

58:37.225 --> 58:39.800
I know it sounds crazy

58:39.825 --> 58:44.216
but I got to love Palle more
and more with each day.

58:44.283 --> 58:49.258
He's a good man... not
mentally ill, as Nielsen says.

58:49.325 --> 58:56.050
Nielsen controlled the people around
Palle. I hated it, but Palle insisted

58:56.116 --> 59:00.966
he and Nielsen were bound by
a common spiritual course shit.

59:04.575 --> 59:09.175
Schouw Nielsen never had a
spiritual thought in his head...

59:09.241 --> 59:11.341
never.

59:24.200 --> 59:26.758
The thing is...

59:28.991 --> 59:31.525
Nielsen also wanted to have me.

59:32.850 --> 59:35.365
He raped me.

59:35.366 --> 59:37.925
I resisted

59:37.991 --> 59:43.216
and I missed five weeks of work
recovering from broken bones...

59:46.116 --> 59:49.091
and what did Palle do?

59:51.033 --> 59:57.425
He approved of what Nielsen did because
it was a part of his spiritual development.

59:58.325 --> 01:00:01.966
Palle had to learn to
give up worldly matters

01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:07.383
everything he was attached to, in
order to get to a higher spiritual level.

01:00:09.658 --> 01:00:12.300
I have two witnesses who will testify

01:00:12.366 --> 01:00:16.800
that you successfully hypnotized
Hardrup while you both were in prison

01:00:18.158 --> 01:00:23.383
and that you raped his wife
to gain control over his mind.

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:27.925
That's more than enough for the public
prosecutor to start an official inquiry.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.800
The noose is tightening around your neck.

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:45.075
And... if I tell you what you want
to know, what do I get out of it?

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:48.800
Your cooperation will be taken into
account when the court sentences you.

01:00:55.066 --> 01:00:55.883
OK!

01:00:56.608 --> 01:00:59.224
so here's the deal.

01:00:59.325 --> 01:01:01.316
I want a decent meal

01:01:01.983 --> 01:01:07.683
and an intimate, pleasurable half-an-hour
with some charming young lady

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:12.800
then I will tell you whatever you want to
know, including how I manipulated Hardrup.

01:01:12.866 --> 01:01:14.100
You're crazy.

01:01:14.101 --> 01:01:18.626
I don't think its an unreasonable
request under the circumstances.

01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:26.183
I would like her to be blond, and
not taller than 170 centimeters

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:30.433
and as young as possible.

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:37.983
I can't do that.

01:01:45.965 --> 01:01:47.265
<i>Whistling</i>

01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:51.358
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

01:01:51.983 --> 01:01:53.983
Wait here.

01:01:55.658 --> 01:01:58.050
But where's the girl?

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.800
Hi Bjørn.

01:02:04.866 --> 01:02:08.633
Nina. A good choice, Mr. Olsen.

01:02:12.158 --> 01:02:14.675
First the confession, then the fun.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:18.600
This isn't the Catholic Church.

01:02:26.783 --> 01:02:28.758
And...

01:02:28.783 --> 01:02:34.675
with the use of hypnosis, I got
Palle Hardrup to rob two banks.

01:02:38.525 --> 01:02:40.233
And?

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.158
That's it.

01:03:00.575 --> 01:03:03.308
This just gets better and better.

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:06.351
Let's keep it decent, OK?

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:10.691
That... I cannot promise.

01:03:53.533 --> 01:03:56.091
Time's nearly up.

01:04:00.075 --> 01:04:02.175
Time's up!

01:04:08.533 --> 01:04:11.425
That... was something.

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:16.283
From time to time your
wife came into my mind.

01:04:17.033 --> 01:04:20.175
She is a very attractive woman.

01:04:20.241 --> 01:04:27.200
Hasn't she told you about our conversations
when we have good food and wine?

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:32.725
When will this dirty dog
be on the streets again?

01:04:32.983 --> 01:04:36.666
With his written confession he
will be given a shorter sentence.

01:04:36.933 --> 01:04:38.833
What written confession?

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.699
Very funny... come on.

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.191
This?

01:04:43.216 --> 01:04:45.482
This is not my signature

01:04:45.483 --> 01:04:48.916
this is a vulgar forgery.

01:04:48.983 --> 01:04:52.041
Obviously it is written
right-handed. I'm left-handed.

01:04:52.208 --> 01:04:55.850
You said so yourself. Police
officers often fake evidence.

01:04:59.716 --> 01:05:01.058
You fucking bastard!

01:05:08.866 --> 01:05:11.216
He got me drunk.

01:05:13.158 --> 01:05:16.300
He... he tried to bribe me

01:05:16.366 --> 01:05:20.300
in every conceivable way.

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:23.866
What has happened?

01:06:25.191 --> 01:06:28.391
I had to release Nielsen.

01:06:28.758 --> 01:06:31.583
He tricked me.

01:06:31.584 --> 01:06:33.207
Tricked?

01:06:33.208 --> 01:06:34.557
Yeah.

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:37.533
He said he was guilty

01:06:38.491 --> 01:06:41.425
but then he took his words back, so...

01:06:44.908 --> 01:06:47.675
But you couldn't keep him?

01:06:48.658 --> 01:06:53.216
I know you've been lying and
continuing meeting with Nielsen

01:06:56.116 --> 01:06:57.966
so...

01:06:59.158 --> 01:07:01.841
if you want to help me...

01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:07.233
keep meeting him...

01:07:07.758 --> 01:07:10.099
try to get some evidence, try talking to him.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.241
Whatever you can find...

01:07:11.242 --> 01:07:12.265
No, I don't want to.

01:07:12.266 --> 01:07:13.407
You have to help me.

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:16.425
I don't know what else to do.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.883
You want to help me, right?

01:07:34.741 --> 01:07:39.800
<i>And through the use of psychic
manipulation and hypnosis</i>

01:07:40.225 --> 01:07:45.533
<i>I convinced Palle Hardrup that
had a divine mission to perform</i>

01:07:49.366 --> 01:07:54.300
<i>For the hypnosis I used
the code "Robin Hood".</i>

01:07:54.741 --> 01:07:57.441
God damn it, Anders!

01:07:57.442 --> 01:07:59.383
How did you allow yourself
to be conned into this?

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.683
Liquor, whores, violence!

01:08:02.608 --> 01:08:08.708
I've had to write Nielsen an official apology.

01:08:08.825 --> 01:08:12.466
Nielsen has promised not to go to the press

01:08:13.533 --> 01:08:19.250
or file a complaint as long
as you stay away from him.

01:08:19.258 --> 01:08:25.600
Jørgensen's psychiatric report will recommend
that Hardrup be committed to a mental hospital...

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.441
that is the end of the case for us.

01:08:28.444 --> 01:08:31.645
I suspect the prosecutor and defense
will want all the evidence at their disposal.

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:33.265
Anders...

01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:37.591
you are hurting yourself now...

01:08:43.033 --> 01:08:48.100
but bring him back one last time...

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:52.140
the Great Polish Bonzini.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.975
The problem is

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.082
that the more we try to hypnotize Hardrup

01:09:01.283 --> 01:09:04.216
the more difficult it becomes.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.591
He just experiences more physical pain.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.050
He claims hypnosis doesn't work on him.

01:09:15.116 --> 01:09:19.383
yet he is very susceptible
to posthypnotic suggestion.

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:22.800
Even though he was
in a very light trance

01:09:22.866 --> 01:09:26.758
Hardrup followed my suggestion
that the food was poisoned.

01:09:26.783 --> 01:09:32.341
and that he should destroy it so
that nobody would be harmed by it.

01:09:33.491 --> 01:09:38.508
I believe Nielsen used the spiritual
experiences they shared together

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:41.341
to gain Hardrup's confidence

01:09:41.408 --> 01:09:45.341
then he used Hardrup's own religious

01:09:45.408 --> 01:09:50.966
political and revolutionary ideas
as the material for his hypnosis.

01:09:51.033 --> 01:09:54.008
We all know that Hardrup is schizophrenic.

01:09:54.009 --> 01:09:55.133
No he's not.

01:09:56.158 --> 01:10:00.050
He is an idealist who became
putty in Nielsen's hands.

01:10:00.116 --> 01:10:04.008
But there is still no
evidence of manipulation.

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:08.800
Precisely. We need facts, not
'Robin Hood' magic tricks.

01:10:09.475 --> 01:10:13.666
I want Nielsen followed every minute,
every second, everywhere he goes.

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:16.066
Shouldn't we leave Nielsen alone,
those were Thuesen's orders.

01:10:16.067 --> 01:10:17.034
David!

01:10:17.735 --> 01:10:19.858
Do you want to report to Thuesen or to me?

01:10:20.059 --> 01:10:22.740
Pick your side.

01:10:23.741 --> 01:10:25.400
I report to you.

01:10:25.725 --> 01:10:27.325
Good.

01:10:32.683 --> 01:10:35.741
It has been quite a while.

01:10:36.783 --> 01:10:40.633
As you can see, the head
of police finally recognized

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:44.300
that your husband had been
trying to prosecute me.

01:10:44.366 --> 01:10:46.508
I've been worried about Anders...

01:10:47.233 --> 01:10:50.682
slightly his whole state of
mind has been changing.

01:10:50.783 --> 01:10:54.966
The long-term impact of early trauma...

01:10:55.033 --> 01:11:00.550
just lash out and find an outer
target for his inner furies.

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:03.825
Maybe...

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:07.524
if you can find more within yourself

01:11:07.825 --> 01:11:10.266
and transfer that feeling to him

01:11:11.291 --> 01:11:13.632
it might start to heal him and his energy.

01:11:13.633 --> 01:11:17.066
You mean like em... using meditation or yoga?

01:11:17.908 --> 01:11:22.925
For instance, guided meditation
could start the process.

01:11:23.825 --> 01:11:27.550
I could help, if you want.

01:11:38.475 --> 01:11:41.408
<i>Uniforms</i>

01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:43.933
<i>Architecture</i>

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.350
<i>The Guardian Angel</i>

01:12:20.475 --> 01:12:22.050
Well...

01:12:22.116 --> 01:12:25.758
it seems congratulations are in order...

01:12:26.783 --> 01:12:28.841
you are pregnant.

01:12:59.516 --> 01:13:00.933
Beautiful.

01:13:01.858 --> 01:13:03.099
Skilled suggestion, huh?

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.091
Letters from Nielsen to Hardrup.

01:13:07.158 --> 01:13:11.925
Some are happy to surrender their
fate to the church or the state.

01:13:11.991 --> 01:13:14.133
Please forget about the sermon, Max.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.591
Someday we'll invent a machine

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:21.300
that sends electric signals
to the brain and controls it.

01:13:21.366 --> 01:13:23.475
Take a look at the letters

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.640
can't make any sense out of them.

01:13:25.641 --> 01:13:28.691
The first letter says:
<i>Greetings, my friend...</i>

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:32.925
<i>summer approaches, nature
blossoms and the air gets warmer.</i>

01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:34.058
The other one...

01:13:34.659 --> 01:13:36.158
it's just as meaningless.

01:13:36.559 --> 01:13:38.282
One thing puzzles me...

01:13:38.283 --> 01:13:41.341
both of the letters are
signed <i>your friend...</i>

01:13:41.408 --> 01:13:44.508
<i>Bjørn Schouw Nielsen XXX</i>

01:13:44.575 --> 01:13:46.441
and they look like swastikas.

01:13:47.266 --> 01:13:48.607
I know they're not but...

01:13:48.832 --> 01:13:50.407
it was just an idea.

01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:52.100
Anders!

01:13:52.525 --> 01:13:55.225
you might be a genius.

01:13:56.525 --> 01:13:57.525
Good afternoon.

01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:00.050
Good afternoon.

01:14:03.033 --> 01:14:04.741
How is it going?

01:14:05.966 --> 01:14:07.407
I'm not complaining.

01:14:07.408 --> 01:14:11.300
Once you've found your balance
you can be content anywhere.

01:14:11.366 --> 01:14:13.800
Can I see that book?

01:14:17.241 --> 01:14:19.091
Anders...

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.591
look at this.

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:37.558
Stop!

01:14:39.125 --> 01:14:44.100
It is one of the most widely
used signs for post-suggestion.

01:14:44.966 --> 01:14:47.933
Whenever Hardrup sees an X

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.600
the suggestion implanted
by Nielsen is preserved.

01:14:52.666 --> 01:14:53.775
Your telephone messages...

01:14:53.776 --> 01:14:54.616
Not now.

01:14:54.617 --> 01:14:56.516
The last one is from your wife.

01:14:57.809 --> 01:14:59.132
Boss
- What?

01:14:59.133 --> 01:15:00.874
Just spoke to surveillance...

01:15:00.875 --> 01:15:03.883
Marie's just had a long meeting with Nielsen.

01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:08.091
Hardrup has to be completely
isolated from any X signs.

01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:11.208
Put him in a new cell

01:15:11.233 --> 01:15:13.574
check it three times a day.

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:17.216
If he makes any X signs,
paint it over immediately.

01:15:17.283 --> 01:15:18.716
All his reading material...

01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:20.599
confiscate it.

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.275
I have to tell you something.

01:15:23.276 --> 01:15:25.216
<i>I know about Nielsen.</i>

01:15:25.241 --> 01:15:26.575
Did he tell you anything?

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.432
<i>No.</i>

01:15:29.033 --> 01:15:31.232
It's... it's something else.

01:15:32.033 --> 01:15:34.416
So no new clues?

01:15:34.941 --> 01:15:36.341
No.

01:15:42.575 --> 01:15:45.675
<i>What do want to say?</i>

01:15:49.408 --> 01:15:52.325
Maybe it's not all that important.

01:15:53.226 --> 01:15:55.349
Marie, I have to go.

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:57.350
<i>Bye</i>.

01:16:02.825 --> 01:16:05.466
I have a great mission

01:16:05.533 --> 01:16:09.633

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:13.258

01:16:41.958 --> 01:16:44.300
Whenever you see this sign

01:16:44.325 --> 01:16:48.325
you will know that God
speaks through this body.

01:16:53.883 --> 01:16:56.525
I am your guardian angel.

01:17:12.775 --> 01:17:15.800
There is nothing physically wrong with him.

01:17:15.825 --> 01:17:18.408
He seems to be going through withdrawal.

01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:20.151
Like an addict.

01:17:20.575 --> 01:17:24.008
Of course I'd... need to do further tests.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.833
Is everything alright?

01:17:41.025 --> 01:17:41.875
Palle?

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:46.215
I know you've separated me from him...

01:17:47.116 --> 01:17:48.333
from God.

01:17:49.458 --> 01:17:52.858
We're just trying to bring
the right man to justice.

01:17:55.491 --> 01:17:57.883
Justice?

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.025
When the Nazis lost

01:18:01.691 --> 01:18:06.375
do you remember what you
did in the name of justice?

01:18:07.908 --> 01:18:12.591
Any girl who'd slept with a
German, had her head shaved

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:17.550
her clothes were torn from her body and she
was made to run naked through the streets.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.758
When the people executed all those

01:18:26.783 --> 01:18:31.300
whose only crime was that
they had defended their country

01:18:31.366 --> 01:18:33.266
was that justice?

01:18:34.391 --> 01:18:37.115
Where were the police then?

01:18:37.116 --> 01:18:38.416
Hm!

01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:55.591
YOU'VE DESTROYED EVERYTHING!

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:58.925
FORT! BRING THE DOCTOR. FORT... THIS WAY.

01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:19.150
Oh no! Oh no no no!

01:19:19.241 --> 01:19:20.841
Are you OK?

01:19:20.842 --> 01:19:21.665
Yes

01:19:22.166 --> 01:19:23.407
better than our friend here.

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:26.141
He's totally disrupted.

01:19:26.566 --> 01:19:29.307
He's been separated from divinity

01:19:29.408 --> 01:19:32.325
that's all his brain keeps telling him.

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:33.490
I don't know.

01:19:33.491 --> 01:19:37.341
There is a risk we might kill him.

01:19:40.741 --> 01:19:42.966
Maybe we should return him to the X's?

01:19:42.967 --> 01:19:44.567
No.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.091
Anders, this is too much.

01:19:53.158 --> 01:19:56.258
You're off the case as of now, it's over.

01:19:56.325 --> 01:20:01.133
The department will conduct an
official investigation into your actions.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.950
What happened to the Great Bonzini?

01:20:29.683 --> 01:20:33.908
I questioned my responsibility
and buried him.

01:20:35.241 --> 01:20:40.533
A young woman I had invited
to come see the Great Bonzini

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.458
awoke me.

01:20:42.783 --> 01:20:45.341
The look she gave me

01:20:45.608 --> 01:20:49.166
that... how I use my skills. It hurt.

01:20:50.033 --> 01:20:53.758
I would have married her you know.

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:59.175
She saw through the whole show...

01:21:02.266 --> 01:21:04.033
and me.

01:21:11.866 --> 01:21:14.508
You lost your child.

01:21:14.575 --> 01:21:19.383
You know better than me
what it means to lose someone.

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:22.800
Did the same happen with your father?

01:21:24.658 --> 01:21:26.591
Yes, but... eh...

01:21:28.658 --> 01:21:31.050
You want to talk?

01:21:34.166 --> 01:21:35.783
Look into my eyes

01:21:36.608 --> 01:21:39.708
and take a deep breath.

01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:45.658
Is this a joke?

01:21:45.683 --> 01:21:47.407
No.

01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:51.183
Look into my eyes.

01:21:54.575 --> 01:21:57.508
OK... let's play your game.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.066
Breathe slowly.

01:22:05.091 --> 01:22:08.165
Very slowly.

01:22:08.266 --> 01:22:10.950
In and out.

01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:13.783
Yes.

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.825
You became a police
officer like your father.

01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:20.799
Yes.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:25.133
We were both stationed in the
same SA unit during the war.

01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:29.425
Spying for the Nazis.

01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:32.925
Just keep looking at my eyes.

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:36.341
So, what happened?

01:22:38.325 --> 01:22:40.800
It felt wrong...

01:22:42.158 --> 01:22:44.100
so I ran away...

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:46.740
all the way to London where I...

01:22:47.241 --> 01:22:51.633
I started working as a police
specialist for the allies

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.883
fighting against the Nazis.

01:22:56.825 --> 01:22:58.841
Against your father?

01:23:00.533 --> 01:23:02.341
Yes.

01:23:03.491 --> 01:23:05.966
And you won the war.

01:23:08.575 --> 01:23:10.341
No.

01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:13.966
I couldn't win.

01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:19.508
Many of our colleagues
were in the SA too

01:23:19.575 --> 01:23:22.008
like Thuesen.

01:23:23.658 --> 01:23:27.841
I wanted to bring them to justice
and have them tried in court

01:23:29.033 --> 01:23:32.258
but too many people were against me.

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:36.216
And you wanted to punish them?

01:23:40.325 --> 01:23:42.800
Take revenge.

01:23:48.033 --> 01:23:50.841
My father died in a car accident

01:23:53.116 --> 01:23:56.008
when the Germans lost the war.

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:01.883
I returned home the day after.

01:24:06.116 --> 01:24:09.800
I don't know if he did it on purpose.

01:24:11.741 --> 01:24:15.383
You could not make up with your father...

01:24:17.158 --> 01:24:19.966
so you punished yourself.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.533
I'll never get to understand why

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.033
why he chose to be a part of them...

01:24:32.516 --> 01:24:35.533
why he became a part of the Nazis.

01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:41.966
Everyone can be manipulated.

01:24:43.366 --> 01:24:47.008
Cry... good, that's good.

01:24:47.075 --> 01:24:49.133
It will be fine.

01:24:49.208 --> 01:24:51.208
It will be OK.

01:24:57.533 --> 01:25:00.800
Your wife Marie... she called me.

01:25:00.866 --> 01:25:04.383
She's been worried
about you. Me too.

01:25:06.975 --> 01:25:09.700
We're trying to help you.

01:25:12.325 --> 01:25:16.050
Dabrowski. One moment please.

01:25:16.116 --> 01:25:19.466
For you. The nurse from hospital.

01:25:19.533 --> 01:25:21.550
Yes?

01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:25.058
Thank you.

01:25:25.866 --> 01:25:29.175
Hardrup's getting worse.

01:25:31.408 --> 01:25:34.091
We should break the lock now.

01:25:46.158 --> 01:25:48.675
Welcome my dear.

01:25:49.575 --> 01:25:51.508
Thanks so much for helping me.

01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:54.033
Come.

01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:59.816
The doctor should be here soon.

01:25:59.817 --> 01:26:01.158
Maybe you should go and get him.

01:26:01.283 --> 01:26:02.325
Sorry?

01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:03.490
Just go.

01:26:04.191 --> 01:26:06.125
GO!

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:13.133
I can understand why so many writers
were captured by the magic of the East.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.858
There's so much to discover.

01:26:14.983 --> 01:26:19.758
Yes. Their way of thinking, their
techniques for self-improvement

01:26:19.783 --> 01:26:22.800
all of which can help set you free

01:26:22.825 --> 01:26:27.591
of that stone of grief you're
hiding inside your soul Marie.

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:31.025
Marie...

01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:33.740
don't let that knowledge...

01:26:33.965 --> 01:26:36.640
even if it is good knowledge

01:26:36.741 --> 01:26:40.300
allow you to hide your secret pain.

01:26:40.766 --> 01:26:43.075
Bring it out.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.800
I can help you.

01:26:46.866 --> 01:26:48.833
I need help.

01:26:49.658 --> 01:26:51.657
I need something.

01:26:51.658 --> 01:26:54.108
Listen... I can't do it.

01:26:55.033 --> 01:26:57.533
This is not right.

01:26:58.058 --> 01:27:01.200
We don't have any choices.

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.158
Alright.

01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:08.816
No, no. Stop.

01:27:08.941 --> 01:27:11.282
Take a deep breath.

01:27:11.283 --> 01:27:14.941
Take a deep breath, I say.

01:27:15.266 --> 01:27:17.966
Yes... slowly.

01:27:18.991 --> 01:27:21.075
Breathe slowly...

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.532
in and out.

01:27:23.533 --> 01:27:24.875
Can he hear you?

01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:28.274
Yes, at some level.

01:27:28.575 --> 01:27:31.591
He is sensitive to suggestions too.

01:27:34.075 --> 01:27:36.866
Concentrate again...

01:27:38.191 --> 01:27:41.791
completely on my voice.

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:45.675
Concentrate on my voice...

01:27:45.741 --> 01:27:49.158
as you feel all the sounds around you...

01:27:49.859 --> 01:27:52.182
begin to fade away...

01:27:52.183 --> 01:27:55.075
to silence...

01:27:55.741 --> 01:27:58.800
holding no meaning whatsoever.

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:05.008
Breathe... in and out.

01:28:06.366 --> 01:28:11.000
You hear the voice of the guardian angel...

01:28:11.783 --> 01:28:16.333
and now you can see and understand...

01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:20.966
where that voice comes from.

01:28:21.033 --> 01:28:25.258
I am going to begin to
count down... from ten

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.550
and when I reach one you
will follow my instructions

01:28:30.658 --> 01:28:32.966
very carefully.

01:28:33.033 --> 01:28:35.258
<i>Is it here?
- Yes</i>

01:28:35.325 --> 01:28:37.975
Let's get him back to the X's!
- Keep going!

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:41.600
KEEP GOING!

01:28:43.366 --> 01:28:47.800
<i>It's Doctor Gammeltoft.
Please open the door.</i>

01:28:47.866 --> 01:28:50.175
Ten.

01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:53.950
Nine.

01:28:54.075 --> 01:28:57.615
You'll feel yourself relaxing...

01:28:57.616 --> 01:29:00.883
more and more. Eight.

01:29:01.283 --> 01:29:05.300
You feel a touch of
divinity within your soul.

01:29:06.366 --> 01:29:11.591
Seven. You must liberate yourself
from things binding you to earth.

01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.508
Six.

01:29:13.575 --> 01:29:17.925
You must kill the feelings
of false attachment

01:29:18.491 --> 01:29:23.883
to acquire true freedom and
release your divine powers.

01:29:24.991 --> 01:29:27.300
Five.

01:29:27.366 --> 01:29:33.341
That is why you must kill, in your
mind, the people closest to you.

01:29:33.408 --> 01:29:35.216
Four.

01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:41.800
Including your own mother again and again.

01:29:41.825 --> 01:29:45.633
until you no longer feel any attachment

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:50.300
that stands in the way
of your great mission.

01:29:50.366 --> 01:29:52.216
Three.

01:29:53.866 --> 01:29:56.150
You are free from the X's.

01:29:56.658 --> 01:29:59.225
I am your guardian angel.
Two.

01:29:59.291 --> 01:30:01.490
You are free, Palle.

01:30:01.491 --> 01:30:05.175
<i>Open the door! We're calling the guards!</i>

01:30:09.825 --> 01:30:13.883
One. The lock is broken.

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:16.074
You are awake.

01:30:16.075 --> 01:30:18.050
How do you feel? Good?

01:30:18.116 --> 01:30:21.925
<i>Open the door or we break it.</i>
- You are good now.

01:30:21.991 --> 01:30:25.050
Sorry. The door was stuck.

01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:31.591
I'm not mad.

01:30:33.783 --> 01:30:36.466
I want a pen and paper.

01:30:42.408 --> 01:30:45.183
He made me kill my own mother...

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:49.008
in my mind...

01:30:51.491 --> 01:30:53.800
again and again.

01:30:59.866 --> 01:31:01.950
I can't believe it.

01:31:02.075 --> 01:31:04.075
He broke through.

01:31:06.575 --> 01:31:10.150
Anders! Marie... She's in Nielsen's house.

01:31:10.151 --> 01:31:11.357
Did anyone go inside?

01:31:11.358 --> 01:31:15.008
No, I... I have to report this to Thuesen, but I wanted to let you know first.
- Wait!

01:31:16.783 --> 01:31:18.841
Let's go!

01:31:27.908 --> 01:31:30.800
Take it, take it, take it, take it!

01:31:30.866 --> 01:31:33.750
There's a young lady with him.
- I know.

01:31:33.875 --> 01:31:36.075
Wait here!

01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:48.800
Marie!

01:31:48.825 --> 01:31:51.925
It took quite a while for you to come.

01:31:51.991 --> 01:31:53.891
Where is she?

01:31:53.892 --> 01:31:56.275
Now now. She's perfectly safe.

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:58.441
Marie?

01:31:58.866 --> 01:32:01.841
She is resting comfortably.

01:32:01.908 --> 01:32:06.925
Specifically until you sign a confession
admitting that you tried to frame me

01:32:06.991 --> 01:32:10.008
that I am perfectly innocent.

01:32:13.416 --> 01:32:14.933
It's over.

01:32:15.058 --> 01:32:17.765
Hardrup told us everything.

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:20.800
About how I hypnotized him...

01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:25.633
how I coerced him into robbing those banks

01:32:25.758 --> 01:32:27.699
killing those people.

01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:29.766
So you admit it?

01:32:29.991 --> 01:32:33.032
Of course, but I don't think you are going
to do anything with that information, are you?

01:32:33.033 --> 01:32:39.208
Not after the inspector got me drunk, beat
me up and coerced a confession from me.

01:32:40.116 --> 01:32:44.091
I've put a suggestion
inside your wife's brain

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:49.466
that she will remain relaxed
until I give her a code word

01:32:49.533 --> 01:32:55.133
and that code word will remain
unspoken until you cooperate with me.

01:33:07.116 --> 01:33:09.800
It's quite funny actually.

01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:13.175
Is it?

01:33:13.241 --> 01:33:17.966
The only reason she was open to
suggestion was because of you.

01:33:19.075 --> 01:33:23.041
You weren't very attentive to
her problems, were you?

01:33:33.891 --> 01:33:36.466
Was that very wise?

01:33:36.891 --> 01:33:39.291
I enjoyed it.

01:33:41.958 --> 01:33:43.766
That's impossible.

01:33:43.767 --> 01:33:45.508
Quite simple actually.

01:33:45.533 --> 01:33:49.966
You're not the only one who can put
locks into people's heads you know.

01:33:54.658 --> 01:33:57.175
Before Marie came to see Nielsen

01:33:57.241 --> 01:34:01.425
she was kind enough to allow me
put a suggestion into her head

01:34:01.491 --> 01:34:04.383
that would block him out.

01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:09.258
Maybe you should have listened to
my lectures a little more carefully.

01:34:11.158 --> 01:34:13.925
Take him away.

01:34:15.575 --> 01:34:17.591
Let's go.

01:34:44.033 --> 01:34:45.883
I'm so sorry.

01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:07.933
How's Thuesen?

01:35:07.934 --> 01:35:09.375
Ashamed.

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.600
<i>Schouw Nielsen: Life imprisonment.
Palle Hardrup: Psychopath custody.</i>

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:24.683
I told you I will get you.

01:36:36.308 --> 01:36:40.200
And you don't think I've got you?

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.200
