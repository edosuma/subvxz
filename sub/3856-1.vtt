00:45.087 --> 00:46.464
Thanks again.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.632
It's lucky we're near the warehouse?

00:48.799 --> 00:49.766
Yeah, not so near.

00:49.925 --> 00:50.972
Bit of a drive.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.978
I'm not gonna have any more,
bacon until Sunday.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.639
Pickles, I...

00:55.806 --> 00:57.979
Okay, well, I guess
we'll just have to manage.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.101
Yeah, well, hopefully
you'll have enough coleslaw.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.311
Who's your regional?

01:01.603 --> 01:02.445
- Gilmour.
- Gilmour.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.652
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What did he say?

01:04.815 --> 01:08.115
Well, I wanted to deal
with the situation first.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.957
Christ, your regional manager
doesn't know?

01:10.445 --> 01:12.493
Come on. How hard is it
to deal with these things?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.581
I don't appreciate
you talking to me like that.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.283
Yeah, well, you know what?

01:17.953 --> 01:21.708
I don't appreciate you letting
$1,500 worth of product spoil.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.007
It is your job to manage this shit,
to keep it together.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.012
How do you deal with your kids?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.262
'Cause my kid has
a... a big game tonight,

01:31.425 --> 01:33.302
and I'm 50 miles away,
dealing with a woman...

01:33.468 --> 01:34.560
Well, I'm sorry about that.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.688
Who thinks she can manage
without bacon!

01:36.847 --> 01:39.441
Okay. Thank you very much
for all your help.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.853
You're fucked without bacon.
I'll tell you that.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.413
Listen. Listen to me.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.752
Sir!

02:04.291 --> 02:05.133
Sir...

02:12.674 --> 02:15.848
Hey, ma'am, it is against code
to park so close to the building.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.685
You need to save this for the customers.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.849
Wait until I tell Sandra.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.017
Wait.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.857
Always fucking up.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.191
Shut up.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.923
Thank you for joining us.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.592
Now, some of you
have heard this before,

02:47.751 --> 02:49.879
but we have got to be
on our best tonight.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.388
I had a surprise this morning.

02:51.546 --> 02:55.426
Apparently somebody forgot
to fully close the freezer door.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.765
Now, I know most of you
weren't working last night,

02:57.928 --> 02:59.896
but obviously
this is not acceptable.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.893
We did lose $1,430
worth of inventory.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.443
Fortunately we were able to get
a last-minute shipment from the warehouse,

03:08.605 --> 03:11.108
but bacon's gonna be short,
bacon and pickles.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.151
What?

03:14.069 --> 03:15.696
Now, Friday nights are crazy,

03:15.862 --> 03:19.036
and Aaron is out because he has
that thing that was going around.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.577
But we've gotta be by the book tonight.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.587
We potentially have a franchise
quality-control person coming,

03:24.746 --> 03:27.875
a secret shopper,
so my food people,

03:28.041 --> 03:30.885
you have gotta be extra careful
with the portions.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.422
Okay? Not just make the order right,

03:33.588 --> 03:35.090
but in the right order.

03:35.257 --> 03:38.727
And let's just use two strips
of bacon per sandwich.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.058
We're gonna have to save it, okay?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.723
And my counter people,

03:42.889 --> 03:45.392
we're gonna do the drops
right on the hour,

03:45.559 --> 03:47.482
so make sure your drawers
are organized.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.146
And I know you're down a person,

03:49.312 --> 03:50.780
but if you don't have a customer,

03:50.939 --> 03:53.658
I want you to clean, clean, clean.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.821
That means you, too, okay?

03:56.987 --> 03:59.206
Y'all know what Friday nights are like,

03:59.364 --> 04:01.833
so let's get to work.

04:13.086 --> 04:17.136
# I know you're dying to be free... #

04:19.134 --> 04:19.976
Thanks, guys.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.603
Thank you.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.141
Here. Stock your section.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.480
She thinks I left the door open.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.189
No. She thinks Kevin did it.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.301
I mean, Kevin did do it, right?

04:31.396 --> 04:33.319
Total. But you think
he's gonna get fired?

04:33.482 --> 04:34.574
I don't know.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.574
Well, I just want her
to quit thinking it's me.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.830
But I just can't be not having
a job right now. You know?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.706
I'm pretty sure you're fine. Yeah.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.576
Is that a new cellphone cover?

04:44.743 --> 04:46.871
Yeah. I decided pink was gonna be
my new thing now.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.163
It's cool. I like it.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.549
I mean, I like the old one, too, though.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.835
Yeah, I know, but the jewels
and stuff started falling off.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.844
Were you talking to John?

04:55.003 --> 04:56.676
No, it's this new guy named Ben.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.717
I kinda started it for fun,
but now I can't decide what to do.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.226
He's kinda crazy, actually.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.978
I don't know how you keep up
with them all, girl.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.310
Yeah, I can hardly handle my fiancÃ©.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.226
What? He proposed?

05:10.268 --> 05:14.023
No, but he called my dad,
so I know it's coming.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.031
That is awesome!

05:15.190 --> 05:16.032
Yeah, thanks.

05:16.191 --> 05:19.115
Awesome.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.995
Congratulations, Sandra.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.030
That's cute.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.699
- That's so cool!
- Thank you.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.162
That is awesome.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.748
God, this one's got, like,

05:27.911 --> 05:29.913
three dudes at the same time,
you know?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.674
And one of them's always named Alonzo
or something... or Vendito.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.426
No, his name was Marco.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.382
I don't know about this guy.

05:36.545 --> 05:40.220
He keeps sending me pictures
of, like, himself without his shirt on,

05:40.382 --> 05:42.225
like, telling me
to return the favor.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.601
But he has really good abs, though.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.762
Does he send you pictures
of his other stuff?

05:45.929 --> 05:47.021
I mean, he hasn't yet,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.853
but I think if I were to do that,

05:49.015 --> 05:50.232
that he'd totally do it.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.565
That is... That is too crazy.

05:53.770 --> 05:54.692
I'm just, like, too old for that.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.732
I guess we missed all of that stuff.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.070
Hey, speak for yourself.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.735
My man sexts me sometimes.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.528
Sandra!

06:02.404 --> 06:03.906
Yeah.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.165
We... We keep it exciting.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.077
He knows what to do
to get me worked up.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.177
Oh, my God.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.803
Who calls it sexting?

06:21.423 --> 06:23.141
Show me. Show me.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.347
So cute.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.556
He's cute, right?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.596
That's, like, Photoshopped, right?

06:29.556 --> 06:30.808
You're leaving, Harold?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.438
Yes, ma'am.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.320
Did you finish with the thing
on the drive-thru?

06:35.478 --> 06:37.697
I had to order a piece.
Should be in tomorrow.

06:37.856 --> 06:38.823
Okay-

06:38.982 --> 06:42.532
Spent afternoon on bushes
out back behind the grease tank.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.162
Oh, good. Thank you.

06:44.613 --> 06:45.893
Did you get your shift meal yet?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.699
No, ma'am.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.039
I'm gonna hold off on that.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.498
I may drop in later, though,

06:51.661 --> 06:53.755
just to have one of
the new type of milkshakes.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.757
Oh, there you go. You should.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.880
The Frost Blenders are really good.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.010
The butterscotch one is good.

06:59.169 --> 07:02.173
I'm not really a cookies-and-cream person,
but that one is good.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.932
You'll have a lot of choices.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.184
A what?

07:10.347 --> 07:13.396
I'll have a chunks combo meal,
the six-piece.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.901
We ain't got no pickles.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.232
You don't have pickles?

07:16.394 --> 07:17.270
Nah.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.939
Do you have coleslaw?

07:19.105 --> 07:19.981
Yeah.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.525
Can I get coleslaw with that?

07:21.691 --> 07:22.567
All right.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.817
Did you see Julio's apron?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.573
Looks like he fell in the fryer,
for goodness' sake.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.662
Yeah, well, who's gonna
talk to him? Not it.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.043
Get him to change it.
Honest to God.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.294
No, seriously, not it.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.547
I'm not having a conversation
with that kid again.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.585
When we get through the rush, I'm gonna
need you to cover for me for a bit.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.425
I gotta call Gilmour,
tell him about the freezer.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.634
You didn't call Robbie?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.799
I thought I would deal with it first.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.808
Sandra...

07:46.967 --> 07:48.059
Oh, tell me about it.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.765
I don't know what I was thinking.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.020
No clue.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.229
Hey, Van. We're swamped.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.735
<i>Hey, babe. How's it going?</i>

07:56.893 --> 07:58.736
It's going swamped, like I said.
What's up?

07:58.895 --> 08:01.694
Well, I know you're gonna
be there for a while still,

08:01.856 --> 08:03.576
and I wanted to see
if it was okay with you.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.866
Jim, from work,
he wants me to come by

08:07.028 --> 08:08.871
and see his new deck,
have a beer with him.

08:09.030 --> 08:09.952
All night?

08:10.115 --> 08:13.540
<i>No. No, just a few beers
while I wait for you to get off.</i>

08:13.702 --> 08:17.127
Yeah, babe. You don't have to have my
permission to hang out with your friends.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.507
I know. Was just checking.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.509
<i>Okay. I gotta go.</i>

08:21.668 --> 08:22.715
We're swamped.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.221
Just don't get too drunk, okay?

08:25.588 --> 08:26.635
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.141
- All right. Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

08:41.730 --> 08:42.856
God.

08:43.023 --> 08:47.654
I know that Frost Blender did not
just try and mess up my nail.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.100
Swear I wasn't even supposed
to be here right now neither.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.831
I know. I need to set it normal.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.368
I want Monday through Thursday,
Saturday, like I used to.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.734
I know, right? They change it,

08:55.827 --> 08:57.044
you can't make plans
or nothing, right?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.420
If they don't stay normal about it,

08:58.580 --> 09:00.298
when I'm working,
I end up waking up late,

09:00.457 --> 09:02.084
and then I can't do anything that day.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.844
You know, I just watch TV,
and it, like, ruins my days off.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.428
Now that you say that,
I could see what you saying.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.716
I could see that.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.385
I'm always waking up late.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.553
Yo, they wasting my days off and shit.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.563
They need to fix that shi...

09:15.722 --> 09:17.520
Let's watch the language, okay?

09:17.682 --> 09:20.936
Connie, look at the condiment bar.
It's a mess.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.702
We don't want it looking like that
if secret shopper comes, do we?

09:23.730 --> 09:26.950
Kevin, get off the counter.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.748
I asked you before to fill your toppings.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.116
No, I know. I... I...

09:30.278 --> 09:31.245
- Go to the freezer and get some.
- Becky...

09:31.404 --> 09:32.246
Don't you dare.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.784
Becky, what did I say to you
about clean, clean, clean?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.827
Sandra!
You got a phone call in the back,

09:37.994 --> 09:38.995
a policeman.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.634
Hello. South End.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.038
<i>Yeah, this is Officer Daniels
with the police department.</i>

09:51.049 --> 09:52.266
<i>Are you a supervisor?</i>

09:52.425 --> 09:54.723
Yes I am. I'm the manager.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.354
<i>What's your name again, ma 'am?</i>

09:56.513 --> 09:58.891
My name is Sandra Fromme.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.934
<i>Sandra. Okay, and you're
the manager. Good.</i>

10:01.101 --> 10:03.822
<i>So I've got your regional manager,
Robert Gilmour, on the other line,</i>

10:03.853 --> 10:06.356
<i>and he's told me to go ahead
and call you directly.</i>

10:06.523 --> 10:08.651
Right. So this is about the freezer.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.778
Freezer?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.366
<i>No, ma 'am. This is about a theft.</i>

10:12.529 --> 10:15.999
It seems one of <i>your</i> employees
stole some money from a customer's purse.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.409
I'm sorry?

10:17.575 --> 10:20.499
<i>You have a young lady,
works at the register,</i>

10:20.662 --> 10:23.211
<i>about 19 years old.</i>

10:23.373 --> 10:24.590
<i>Blonde?</i>

10:24.749 --> 10:26.046
Becky?

10:26.209 --> 10:29.304
<i>Becky. Yeah, we have her name
as Rebecca. That's right, Becky.</i>

10:29.462 --> 10:31.135
In the South End store?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.098
- Yeah, that's right, ma'am.
- This happened...

10:33.133 --> 10:36.012
<i>We have the customer here
who says she can attest to the theft.</i>

10:36.177 --> 10:37.645
Okay.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.522
So this happened now, today?

10:39.973 --> 10:40.895
<i>That's correct, ma 'am.</i>

10:41.057 --> 10:43.105
<i>My marked units are gonna
come in behind soon.</i>

10:43.268 --> 10:45.588
<i>We've been observing her
as part of a bigger investigation,</i>

10:45.645 --> 10:49.070
<i>but Mr. Gilmour said I could count on you</i>
<i>for your help in the matter.</i>

10:49.232 --> 10:50.233
Well, sure.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.074
What is the bigger investigation?
Do you mind my asking?

10:53.236 --> 10:55.156
<i>I can't share that with you
at this time, ma 'am.</i>

10:55.238 --> 10:56.911
<i>- No, I'm sorry. Sure.
- I can say you'll be doing</i>

10:57.073 --> 10:59.667
<i>me and my department a big favor
by helping out.</i>

11:00.368 --> 11:01.328
We don't have any bacon!

11:01.369 --> 11:02.586
Brie, go back to your station.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.588
I need you to take over for Becky up front.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.590
I have to bring her in back
for some questions.

11:06.749 --> 11:07.875
- The police?
- She stole from somebody.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.840
I can't say anything more than that.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.425
A'ight, here you go.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.349
Becky, come with me.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.105
Marti'll take over your station.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.811
- Hey, what's all that?
- Don't worry about it.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.275
Hi. Welcome to ChickWich.
What can I get for you?

11:28.438 --> 11:30.478
- I could take your order?
- Can I get a number one?

11:34.485 --> 11:36.328
Becky, I've got the police
here on the phone

11:36.487 --> 11:39.912
- saying you stole money from a customer.
- What?

11:40.074 --> 11:42.034
They're saying you took it
out of a woman's purse.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.503
I didn't... I didn't steal anything at all.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.629
Hold on.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.417
Hello, Officer?

11:48.583 --> 11:50.303
I swear I didn't take
anything at all, okay?

11:50.418 --> 11:51.298
Just hold on. Hold on.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.633
<i>- Do you have Becky?
- Hello?</i>

11:52.795 --> 11:55.014
<i>- Yes, I do.
- What is she saying?</i>

11:55.173 --> 11:57.392
She's saying she didn't take anything.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.519
<i>Put her on for me, please.</i>

12:00.303 --> 12:01.225
Just a minute.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.105
Wants to talk to you.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.307
Hello.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.817
<i>Becky, I'm Officer Daniels.</i>

12:05.975 --> 12:08.774
<i>I'm gonna need you to answer
a few questions for me, okay?</i>

12:08.937 --> 12:10.564
Okay. That's fine. Just... Okay.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.780
<i>Okay, I have a woman here that says
you took money out of her purse.</i>

12:14.943 --> 12:16.240
<i>We also have one of my surveillance...</i>

12:16.402 --> 12:18.203
I didn't take anything at all, sir.
I don't...

12:18.238 --> 12:21.617
<i>Okay. Well, hang on. We also have one of
my surveillance units backing up her claim.</i>

12:21.783 --> 12:23.785
<i>You want to clear this up for me?</i>

12:23.952 --> 12:27.547
I swear I didn't take anything.
I couldn't have done anything like that.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.002
That doesn't make a...
I'm sorry,

12:29.165 --> 12:30.925
but that just doesn't
even make sense at all.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.129
<i>Right. I have a woman
who ordered from you</i>

12:34.295 --> 12:36.297
<i>in the last hour saying you did.</i>

12:36.464 --> 12:37.966
<i>She described you exactly.</i>

12:40.510 --> 12:42.137
Sir, I'm sorry.
I don't know what to tell you,

12:42.303 --> 12:44.305
but I didn't have anything to do
with anything like that at all.

12:44.472 --> 12:48.272
<i>Well, I have my surveillance unit here
saying you've done a lot of things.</i>

12:51.521 --> 12:54.821
Okay. I don't know what's going on here.
I was just at work, for real.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.109
- Like, I'm... I'm just trying...
- Ma 'am. Ma 'am.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.996
- To do my job, and I don't know...
- Ma'am.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.115
<i>I'm gonna need you to do me a favor
and calm down for me, okay?</i>

13:03.241 --> 13:04.618
<i>- We'll get to the bottom of this.
- I mean, I think that I could have</i>

13:04.784 --> 13:06.752
shortchanged somebody
or something, but...

13:06.911 --> 13:08.333
It-it could be that.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.124
<i>Can you put Sandra back
on the phone for me, honey?</i>

13:11.291 --> 13:12.133
Okay-

13:12.292 --> 13:13.293
<i>- Hello.
- I'm sorry.</i>

13:13.459 --> 13:15.427
<i>Sandra, I hate to ask you to do this.</i>

13:15.586 --> 13:19.511
<i>I need you to do me a favor and search
her personal items, her pockets.</i>

13:19.674 --> 13:22.052
<i>If you find a phone,</i>

13:22.218 --> 13:25.267
<i>you should probably hold on to it
for the time being.</i>

13:25.430 --> 13:26.898
Okay-

13:28.391 --> 13:30.109
He wants me to check your pockets.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.691
Why don't you just show me
what you've got in your pockets.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.731
Okay-

13:35.898 --> 13:38.179
There's nothing. There's...
I mean, I have my phone and...

13:38.276 --> 13:39.676
I need to hold on to the cellphone.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.098
- Okay.
- Just for the time being.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.122
Now your front pockets.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.874
They're not real pockets.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.330
They're sewed up
'cause they're skinnies.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.665
They don't open.
There's nothing in them.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.171
Not our standard khakis.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.174
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry,
but they were dirty. I didn't...

13:53.333 --> 13:56.257
Officer, I've checked her pockets,
and there's nothing in them,

13:56.419 --> 13:57.966
and I do have her cell phone.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.507
<i>Okay, good.
Does she have a purse?</i>

14:00.673 --> 14:02.892
Do you have a purse?
You have a purse?

14:03.051 --> 14:04.428
I have... I still have my purse.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.141
It wouldn't be here in the office.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.944
It would be in the employee cubicle area,

14:08.014 --> 14:09.516
which is on the other
side of the restaurant.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.901
<i>Employee cubbies. That's a...
a different room. Okay.</i>

14:12.060 --> 14:13.107
<i>Is your phone portable, Sandra?</i>

14:13.269 --> 14:14.612
<i>Can you keep me on?</i>

14:14.771 --> 14:16.239
No, the signal wouldn't reach out to there.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.650
We would get cut off. Sorry.

14:18.816 --> 14:19.908
- <i>All right.</i>
- Okay.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.741
- Go ahead.
- I'm gonna put you on hold.

14:21.903 --> 14:22.825
<i>That's fine.</i>

14:22.987 --> 14:24.204
He's asking about my purse?

14:24.364 --> 14:26.366
Come on. I gotta go check your purse.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.375
Sandra, you know I haven't been
to my purse since the staff meeting.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.376
Let's just get this over with.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.860
Let's just get this over with.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.303
I didn't take anything.
I swear. You know me.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.304
I've never stolen anything
in my entire life.

14:40.463 --> 14:41.715
If it turns out that you did,

14:41.881 --> 14:43.724
I'm going to have to
fire you on the spot.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.725
Please, Sandra.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.851
- All right.
- No!

14:46.010 --> 14:47.210
Let's just get this over with.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.805
Which one of them is yours?

14:54.936 --> 14:56.028
Is this about the freezer?

14:56.187 --> 14:58.064
'Cause I really don't think
I had anything to do with that,

14:58.231 --> 14:59.733
but if I did, I'm sorry, okay?

14:59.899 --> 15:02.152
I'm sorry, honey,
but we have to take this seriously.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.117
No, it is not about the freezer.
It's about the cops.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.371
- Does this zipper part open?
- Yes.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.254
We can't have employees
stealing from a customer, you know.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.508
But I was working. You saw me.
I was up there.

15:16.666 --> 15:20.637
Okay. Then why do I have a police officer
calling me, describing you exactly,

15:20.795 --> 15:24.174
telling me your name and saying
that you stole from a customer?

15:24.340 --> 15:25.967
What am I supposed to do with that?

15:26.134 --> 15:27.260
I don't know. Just...

15:27.427 --> 15:29.555
I guess I have to take this with me now.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.721
Come on.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.481
You okay, Sandra?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.065
Still dealing with it.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.537
Hello, Officer? Hello?

15:46.696 --> 15:48.198
<i>Yeah. What... What's the news?</i>

15:48.364 --> 15:52.585
I didn't find anything
in her purse or in her pockets.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.579
<i>I was afraid that might happen.</i>

15:54.745 --> 15:57.715
<i>Okay, this is gonna require
more of your help, then.</i>

15:58.374 --> 16:00.047
<i>I'm gonna need you
to keep her there.</i>

16:00.209 --> 16:02.337
<i>Me and my marked units
are gonna come in soon.</i>

16:02.503 --> 16:05.598
<i>Till then, can I count on you
to assist the authorities?</i>

16:05.756 --> 16:06.928
Yes, of course.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.970
Whatever you...
Whatever you need.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.185
She's been a good person
here at the restaurant.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.725
I... You're sure about this?

16:15.892 --> 16:17.815
<i>Are we sure about this?</i>

16:17.977 --> 16:22.608
<i>I have the victim here with me.
Why, you think she's innocent?</i>

16:22.773 --> 16:26.368
We just never had any trouble
with her before. That's all.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.781
<i>Right, but, I mean,</i>
<i>doesn't it make sense</i>

16:29.947 --> 16:31.748
<i>that if she was doing
something wrong, that...</i>

16:31.782 --> 16:34.126
<i>she wouldn't want you to know,
that she'd...</i>

16:34.285 --> 16:36.629
<i>I don't know... hide it from you?</i>

16:38.331 --> 16:40.584
Yeah, I guess.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.592
<i>Right.</i>

16:41.751 --> 16:42.627
Yeah.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.795
<i>Well, look, I hear a little...</i>

16:44.962 --> 16:47.385
<i>hesitation in your voice, Sandra?</i>

16:47.548 --> 16:50.552
- <i>No, no. I'm, you know...</i>
- <i>It's okay, you know?</i>

16:50.718 --> 16:52.079
I'm just trying to do the right...

16:52.178 --> 16:53.395
<i>- Yeah, it's fine.
- What I'm... Yeah.</i>

16:53.554 --> 16:55.352
<i>Look, Sandra, I'm the police officer.</i>

16:55.515 --> 16:58.018
<i>I'm the one who's gotta take the hit.</i>

16:58.184 --> 16:59.527
Yes.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.359
<i>I want you to know that as an officer,</i>

17:02.522 --> 17:03.990
<i>the officer in this case,</i>

17:04.147 --> 17:06.867
<i>I have to take the full,
final responsibility for this,</i>

17:07.026 --> 17:09.529
<i>- and I take that very seriously, okay?
- Right. Right. Yes.</i>

17:09.694 --> 17:12.376
<i>And I have your regional manager,
Robert Gilmour, on the other line.</i>

17:12.406 --> 17:14.374
- Right.
- We need to act <i>now.</i>

17:14.534 --> 17:16.536
<i>- Okay.
- Your responsibility</i>

17:17.411 --> 17:21.165
<i>is to facilitate that action,
so I... I don't even...</i>

17:21.332 --> 17:23.675
<i>You know, it's your job.
You understand?</i>

17:25.795 --> 17:27.137
Yes. Yes, I do,

17:27.296 --> 17:30.641
and I'll do everything, you know,
that you need.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.677
<i>All right. Can you put Becky
on for me, please?</i>

17:32.843 --> 17:34.641
Sure.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.477
Wants to talk to you.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.442
Hello, Officer.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.814
<i>All right, I need you to shoot me straight
and just explain this whole situation to me.</i>

17:43.980 --> 17:46.779
I have no idea what happened.
I don't know what's going on.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.784
I was working.
I was up front. I was wor...

17:48.943 --> 17:50.744
You can ask anybody
that was up there with me.

17:50.861 --> 17:51.987
<i>- Do me a favor and calm down.
- I was...</i>

17:52.154 --> 17:55.784
<i>Just calm down
and explain the situation to me, okay?</i>

17:57.618 --> 17:59.120
All I know is that I was working,

17:59.287 --> 18:02.336
and then Sandra came and told me
that I stole some lady's money.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.341
That... That is everything that I know.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.175
<i>You stole some lady's money.</i>
<i>Did you know the lady in question?</i>

18:10.214 --> 18:13.093
No. I don... I can't even think of anyone
that it would possibly be.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.727
<i>- Miss,</i> be quiet.
- There's no one...

18:14.885 --> 18:17.604
Now, had you seen this woman
before on the premises?

18:17.763 --> 18:20.243
<i>If you're just straight with me,
it'll all be worked out, okay?</i>

18:20.391 --> 18:22.814
I am being s...
I'm... I'm being straight with you.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.776
<i>Okay, so what that tells me is
that you don't realize</i>

18:25.938 --> 18:28.316
<i>what kind of trouble you're in here.</i>

18:28.482 --> 18:32.487
<i>I'm gonna need you to address me
as sir or officer, understand?</i>

18:35.531 --> 18:36.748
Yes, sir.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.159
<i>Okay, good.</i>

18:39.160 --> 18:40.662
<i>Now, first we need to find the money.</i>

18:40.828 --> 18:42.830
<i>Now, do... do you want
to tell me where it is?</i>

18:45.041 --> 18:46.543
I don't have any money.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.211
<i>You don't have any money?</i>

18:48.377 --> 18:51.051
<i>Well, why are there people
who say otherwise?</i>

18:53.466 --> 18:54.592
I don't know.

18:54.759 --> 18:55.635
<i>You don't know.</i>

18:55.801 --> 18:59.271
<i>- I don't know why.
- You don't know! Okay.</i>

18:59.430 --> 19:02.934
<i>This isn't the easy way
out of this, you understand?</i>

19:03.100 --> 19:04.901
What... What can I do?
How can I help? Like...

19:04.935 --> 19:06.107
<i>Just put Sandra back on,</i>

19:06.270 --> 19:08.113
<i>but you need to do
what she tells you, okay?</i>

19:08.272 --> 19:11.321
I mean, yeah, of course. Of course
I'm gonna do what she tells me to,

19:11.484 --> 19:12.964
and I'm gonna do what you tell me to.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.905
<i>- Then we'll be okay, okay?
- That's fine, but...</i>

19:15.571 --> 19:17.414
- Okay.
<i>- Just put Sandra back on the phone, please.</i>

19:17.573 --> 19:18.574
All right.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.378
Hello?

19:23.537 --> 19:26.757
<i>Hi, Sandra. I'll need your help
till I can get down there.</i>

19:26.916 --> 19:28.196
<i>We really have two choices here.</i>

19:28.292 --> 19:29.589
Okay, what do you need?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.174
<i>We need to find the money,</i>

19:31.337 --> 19:33.635
<i>but I want to make this
as easy as possible for Becky.</i>

19:33.798 --> 19:35.095
<i>Wouldn't you agree?</i>

19:35.257 --> 19:36.759
Yes, I would.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.428
<i>So that's the first thing.</i>

19:38.594 --> 19:41.518
<i>And in this situation, either...</i>

19:41.681 --> 19:44.560
<i>and I don't like this...
we drag her downtown.</i>

19:44.725 --> 19:47.274
<i>We book her. We process her.</i>

19:47.436 --> 19:50.235
<i>We put her in a holding cell,
where she'll probably be all night.</i>

19:50.398 --> 19:52.196
That seems very extreme.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.328
<i>Yeah. I mean, I think in order to</i>
<i>keep this sort of contained,</i>

19:55.486 --> 19:59.957
<i>what we could do is just have you
strip-search her right now.</i>

20:00.991 --> 20:02.789
<i>Would just be easier and quicker, I think.</i>

20:06.372 --> 20:07.294
Gee, I don't know if...

20:07.456 --> 20:09.299
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.259
<i>Yeah, I know, but her story
doesn't jibe, see?</i>

20:11.419 --> 20:13.171
<i>- You know, I mean...
- I know, but it means</i>

20:13.337 --> 20:15.214
<i>we have to put her into the system,
you know?</i>

20:17.091 --> 20:19.935
<i>Look, I understand you not wanting
to get involved, but...</i>

20:20.094 --> 20:21.812
Gee, I'm not sure...

20:21.971 --> 20:23.772
<i>In my experience,
it could be a very big deal.</i>

20:23.931 --> 20:25.103
To be honest.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.815
<i>Yeah, well, a trial
can drag on a long time.</i>

20:27.977 --> 20:30.275
<i>There's a direct cost to her
being taken in.</i>

20:30.438 --> 20:32.236
- Sandra...
- Yeah.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.526
<i>Federal conviction rate is over 90%.</i>

20:35.192 --> 20:36.753
<i>You know, she seems like a nice person.</i>

20:36.819 --> 20:37.866
Yeah.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.496
<i>If there's any doubt, you know,</i>

20:39.655 --> 20:42.750
<i>having you do it there
could be a big help to her.</i>

20:42.908 --> 20:44.376
Yeah. I mean, it seems...
I'm not...

20:45.077 --> 20:47.000
<i>I don't want you to worry about this part,</i>

20:47.163 --> 20:50.542
<i>because I have to take the full,
final responsibility for this,</i>

20:50.708 --> 20:53.552
<i>and I do, and I take that
very seriously.</i>

20:53.711 --> 20:55.588
<i>So take that off your shoulders.</i>

20:59.049 --> 21:01.097
Okay. Just... Just a second.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.013
He's saying that...

21:05.222 --> 21:08.977
that he will have
to take you down to jail

21:09.143 --> 21:12.738
and that, most likely,
you'll have to spend the night,

21:12.897 --> 21:15.070
or I could...

21:15.232 --> 21:17.405
I could strip-search you here.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.487
What? No.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.497
No.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.366
No way.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.705
<i>Just tell her that it's gonna be quicker
if you strip-search her.</i>

21:25.868 --> 21:27.415
This'll all be over quicker.

21:27.995 --> 21:28.962
'Cause if we go to the jail...

21:29.121 --> 21:33.297
Beck, if we go to the jail,
it just takes much longer.

21:35.044 --> 21:38.799
This is so stupid.
I didn't do anything at all.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.181
<i>What did she say?</i>

21:42.301 --> 21:44.724
<i>It's either that or take her to jail
and hold her overnight, okay?</i>

21:44.887 --> 21:46.889
Hold on. So, honey,
what do you want to do?

21:48.974 --> 21:50.692
I mean, what...
what do you mean?

21:50.851 --> 21:52.569
What I mean is it looks like

21:52.728 --> 21:54.901
we're either gonna have
to go down to the jail...

21:55.064 --> 21:56.532
<i>we</i> don't have much of a choice...

21:56.690 --> 21:58.658
or, you know, I can do it here,

21:58.818 --> 22:02.698
which I think is really much,
much easier for you. Don't you?

22:07.284 --> 22:08.661
Okay-

22:08.828 --> 22:11.126
- Okay.
- Okay. You want me to search you...

22:11.288 --> 22:13.666
Search. Yeah, search.
Okay, search. God.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.256
So we'll...
we'll just do that really quickly.

22:16.418 --> 22:19.342
I'll get Marti in here,
and we'll do it really quick, okay?

22:19.505 --> 22:20.757
<i>She say yes?</i>

22:20.923 --> 22:22.484
Yeah, can you just bring Marti in here?

22:23.092 --> 22:27.472
Yeah. She is saying yes, but I think I need
to get my shift supervisor in here, right?

22:27.638 --> 22:29.436
<i>Well, it'd be best not
to have her actually.</i>

22:29.598 --> 22:32.021
<i>It's faster for everyone</i>
<i>the quicker it can happen.</i>

22:32.184 --> 22:33.811
Yeah, but she's asking for Marti,

22:33.978 --> 22:35.901
and I think in situations like this,

22:36.063 --> 22:39.408
corporate would insist on having
two supervisors present. I mean...

22:39.567 --> 22:41.740
<i>Oka... Oh, corporate does?</i>

22:41.902 --> 22:45.372
Yeah. Well, I mean,
what does Robbie think?

22:45.948 --> 22:47.200
<i>What does Robbie think?</i>

22:47.366 --> 22:48.208
Yeah, about...

22:48.367 --> 22:49.289
<i>Robert?</i>

22:50.494 --> 22:53.213
<i>You know what? I don't know.
Let me ask him. Hold on.</i>

22:54.957 --> 22:56.959
He's talking to Robbie.

23:01.297 --> 23:04.722
- Is Marti up front?
- Oh, she went to the back.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.844
I'm sure Becky didn't have
anything to do with it.

23:06.886 --> 23:07.762
What?

23:07.928 --> 23:09.475
Is this all about the freezer?

23:09.638 --> 23:10.560
No, no, no.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.317
- L-ls everything okay with Becky?
- Not really.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.024
Okay, Marti, I need you
to come with me to the office.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.984
I know we're swamped,
but this is important.

23:20.858 --> 23:21.859
<i>I know you don't want to do this,</i>

23:22.026 --> 23:23.994
<i>but it's gonna be okay.</i>
<i>It's fine, really.</i>

23:24.153 --> 23:25.826
<i>I've done a million of these,</i>

23:25.988 --> 23:28.707
<i>and, it's fine, you know.</i>
<i>It's not pleasant.</i>

23:28.866 --> 23:30.546
<i>I</i> mean, <i>you don't like it.</i>
<i>I don't like it.</i>

23:30.618 --> 23:35.624
<i>I don't know any guy, as many years
as I've been on the job, enjoys this.</i>

23:36.248 --> 23:38.296
<i>Think about poor Sandra.</i>

23:40.377 --> 23:41.970
Yeah.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.176
<i>You know what, Becky?</i>

23:43.339 --> 23:45.216
<i>You seem like a nice person, honestly.</i>

23:45.382 --> 23:48.761
<i>I, you know, I hate to get</i>
<i>conflicting information like this,</i>

23:48.928 --> 23:50.601
<i>and it's confusing,</i>

23:50.763 --> 23:53.562
<i>and it bothers me as much
as I'm sure it bothers you, so...</i>

23:53.724 --> 23:54.691
Yes.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.477
<i>I mean, it'd be really helpful</i>

23:56.644 --> 23:58.487
<i>for me and for her, I'm sure,</i>

23:58.646 --> 24:02.116
<i>if you're a good girl
and you make it easy on Sandra.</i>

24:02.274 --> 24:05.448
<i>I just... I need you to be
a good actress for her,</i>

24:05.611 --> 24:09.912
<i>you know, if you could pretend
like it doesn't bother you, okay?</i>

24:10.074 --> 24:11.576
Okay, I mean, it just...

24:12.284 --> 24:15.379
It's really crazy.
I've never done anything like this.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.586
Like, I'm really freaked out.
I... You know what I mean?

24:18.749 --> 24:20.092
I just want it all to be over.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.718
<i>No, I don't know what you mean,</i>

24:21.877 --> 24:24.277
<i>because I've never stolen money
while I was at work like you,</i>

24:24.296 --> 24:25.843
<i>because I don't commit crimes.</i>

24:26.006 --> 24:27.327
Well, I haven't done that either.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.887
<i>Listen, Becky, have you ever
been arrested before?</i>

24:31.053 --> 24:32.145
No, of course not.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.557
<i>Then relax!</i>

24:34.723 --> 24:37.021
<i>We're trying to make sure you're okay.</i>

24:37.184 --> 24:40.028
<i>After she searches you, it'll all be over.</i>

24:42.690 --> 24:46.490
<i>Hey, do you have any older siblings
ever been in trouble with the law?</i>

24:50.823 --> 24:51.744
Do you mean my brother?

24:51.865 --> 24:54.584
<i>Bingo. That's right, your brother.</i>

24:55.160 --> 24:59.836
<i>And has your brother told you...
that he's still in trouble?</i>

25:01.041 --> 25:02.543
So now what's happening?

25:02.710 --> 25:05.930
We have to strip-search Becky,
and I wanted you to come in.

25:06.088 --> 25:09.092
Corporate always wants two people
for a strip search, right?

25:09.258 --> 25:10.475
You think she stole something?

25:10.634 --> 25:13.979
I don't know. I didn't find anything,
but it's either this, or she goes to jail.

25:14.138 --> 25:15.811
- Oh, Sandra, but Becky...
- I know,

25:15.973 --> 25:18.522
but I don't know what else we can do.

25:20.978 --> 25:24.152
I don't see how that has
anything to do with this at all.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.737
This is so stupid.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.618
Hello, Officer. We're back.

25:28.777 --> 25:32.452
<i>Great. You're really
helping us out here, Sandra.</i>

25:32.614 --> 25:35.242
<i>I was just telling Robert
how lucky we all are you're there.</i>

25:35.409 --> 25:36.752
<i>You're almost like a real cop.</i>

25:36.910 --> 25:39.834
Well, I'm just trying to do my job.

25:39.997 --> 25:41.670
<i>Well, you're doing perfect.</i>

25:41.832 --> 25:43.379
Thank you.

25:43.542 --> 25:48.924
<i>Okay, so I'm gonna need you
have her strip down now.</i>

25:49.089 --> 25:50.341
<i>Look through everything.</i>

25:53.719 --> 25:54.891
Okay-

25:56.388 --> 25:59.392
He says it's time to...

26:00.392 --> 26:01.985
Let's just try to...

26:02.144 --> 26:04.305
The faster you do it, honey,
the faster we're finished.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.906
Come on.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.165
Okay-

26:25.626 --> 26:27.503
All right.

26:28.462 --> 26:29.714
Your shoes, hon.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.282
Okay.

26:58.242 --> 27:01.041
Okay. I've...

27:01.203 --> 27:02.921
I've checked the clothes,

27:03.080 --> 27:05.629
and they're... they're clean.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.209
What do you have?

27:07.376 --> 27:08.218
Everything's clean.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.630
I have her...

27:10.796 --> 27:12.013
you know, her shirt

27:12.172 --> 27:14.766
and her undershirt and her shoes

27:14.925 --> 27:18.145
and her pants, and they're all...

27:18.303 --> 27:20.772
There's nothing in them.

27:20.931 --> 27:24.652
<i>Well, no, it's just that there isn't
anything you're trained to see.</i>

27:24.810 --> 27:28.030
<i>Have you checked
her underwear yet?</i>

27:32.317 --> 27:33.614
No, we just...

27:35.112 --> 27:37.285
I just looked...
I just checked her clothes.

27:37.447 --> 27:40.621
<i>Okay. It's gotta be everything.</i>
<i>That's probably what's going on here.</i>

27:40.784 --> 27:44.664
<i>Padded bras can often be
where thieves hide things</i>

27:44.830 --> 27:46.252
<i>and... and panties, of course.</i>

27:46.415 --> 27:49.840
<i>What style of panties
does she have?</i>

27:50.002 --> 27:51.595
Let's see.

27:51.753 --> 27:55.678
I guess cotton bikini.

27:59.261 --> 28:02.640
<i>Yeah, you're gonna need
to take those off, all of it.</i>

28:08.478 --> 28:09.946
Okay-

28:13.066 --> 28:14.443
He wants you to...

28:18.363 --> 28:21.116
He wants you to take off the...

28:21.950 --> 28:22.951
take off your underwear.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.870
No, Sandra, really,
we're taking her underwear off?

28:25.037 --> 28:26.254
Well, he's saying...
He's just saying,

28:26.413 --> 28:29.587
there's padded bras or something,
you can hide stuff in it.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.447
You need to take off both.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.573
Okay-

29:03.742 --> 29:06.086
Okay-

29:06.245 --> 29:09.795
Well, this should clear it right up,
and we'll be done with it now.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.876
Okay, I'm...

29:13.043 --> 29:14.795
The clothes are...

29:14.962 --> 29:18.683
just seem fine. Everything...

29:20.550 --> 29:24.180
<i>What about her rear?
Did you make her turn around?</i>

29:31.144 --> 29:33.738
He wants you to turn around.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.203
Okay, she's not hiding anything.

29:40.779 --> 29:45.205
<i>Sometimes people sew
secret compartments in their clothes.</i>

29:45.367 --> 29:47.040
<i>You can't see them
unless you're trained for it.</i>

29:47.202 --> 29:50.172
<i>We 'II just look over it
before we let her go.</i>

29:50.330 --> 29:53.004
<i>Here's what I'm gonna need you to do.
Do you have a car?</i>

29:53.166 --> 29:54.588
Yes.

29:54.751 --> 29:57.379
<i>Okay, I'm gonna need you
to take all the clothes,</i>

29:57.546 --> 30:00.971
<i>along with her purse and cellphone,
and put them all in a bag, okay?</i>

30:01.133 --> 30:03.511
<i>What kind of car do you have?</i>

30:03.677 --> 30:07.181
2000 Subaru.
Can you get that bag for me?

30:07.347 --> 30:12.194
<i>2000 Subaru. Okay.
All right, put everything in the bag,</i>

30:12.352 --> 30:15.231
<i>and put the bag in the front seat
of your car, and leave it unlocked</i>

30:15.397 --> 30:16.694
<i>so we can inspect it
as soon as we get there.</i>

30:16.857 --> 30:18.859
Well, hang on a minute. And...

30:19.860 --> 30:21.362
Why... Why would I put it in my car?

30:21.528 --> 30:24.122
I mean, is she supposed
to just stay in here?

30:24.281 --> 30:26.124
I'm just supposed
to stay in here like this?

30:26.283 --> 30:28.206
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

30:30.412 --> 30:33.086
I'm just not understanding why it has to be
in my car, though. That's the only thing.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.592
<i>Yes, ma'am. I can... Wait.</i>

30:35.751 --> 30:38.630
Okay, so she's just gonna be in here.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.012
<i>Okay, two reasons:</i>

30:40.172 --> 30:45.429
<i>One, she won't have access to the clothes to
get the money back when you're not looking,</i>

30:45.594 --> 30:47.892
<i>and also then we can check it,
and if it's clean,</i>

30:48.055 --> 30:51.309
<i>we bring her clothes back inside with us
so she doesn't have to, you know,</i>

30:51.475 --> 30:54.103
<i>walk through the restaurant naked
when we escort her out.</i>

30:54.269 --> 30:56.271
<i>It's just...</i>
<i>It's</i> a <i>standard thing.</i>

30:56.438 --> 30:58.281
I'll clock you out. Just go,

30:58.440 --> 31:00.320
and I'll make sure you get paid
for today, okay?

31:00.442 --> 31:01.284
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.741
They're saying...

31:04.488 --> 31:05.740
that I need to put it in my car

31:05.906 --> 31:08.955
so that when they get here,
they can check the stuff.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.415
Your car? Sandra, when...

31:11.578 --> 31:14.878
They can't give it back to the perpetrator
until they have checked it all.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.795
But, I mean, that just sound...
I don't know. I don't know.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.214
Can I just keep her things
here with her

31:22.381 --> 31:24.224
or up front until you get here?

31:24.383 --> 31:27.762
<i>Well, n... Yeah, yes. Yes, ma 'am.
I hear you.</i>

31:27.928 --> 31:29.430
I mean, when are you coming?

31:29.596 --> 31:31.644
<i>All right, look...</i>

31:32.724 --> 31:33.976
<i>We don't normally share this,</i>

31:34.142 --> 31:37.942
<i>but considering the time-sensitive nature
and my needing your help,</i>

31:38.105 --> 31:42.576
<i>I feel like I should explain
the broader investigation of Rebecca.</i>

31:44.152 --> 31:45.449
Okay-

31:45.612 --> 31:48.240
<i>I'm currently investigating
with my team...</i>

31:48.407 --> 31:50.535
<i>I'm investigating her house.</i>

31:51.785 --> 31:52.627
- Her house?
- Yes.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.834
Wait. What about my house?

31:54.996 --> 31:56.498
<i>The thing is, her brother...</i>

31:56.665 --> 31:58.383
Why is she talking about my house?

31:58.542 --> 31:59.964
<i>Is a suspect in an investigation</i>

32:00.127 --> 32:02.300
<i>over growing a large amount
of marijuana.</i>

32:02.462 --> 32:07.684
<i>We believe that Rebecca may have
knowledge and may also be selling.</i>

32:10.053 --> 32:13.102
They're saying that your house,
your brother might have someth...

32:13.265 --> 32:15.518
- <i>No, please, ma'am. Ma'am! Sandra.</i>
- What?

32:15.684 --> 32:17.937
<i>- This is confidential information. Okay?
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

32:18.103 --> 32:20.572
<i>We're hoping that if we can find
the money that she stole,</i>

32:20.730 --> 32:22.198
<i>then we can bring her in</i>

32:22.357 --> 32:24.109
<i>and get a plea confession
in this other situation.</i>

32:24.276 --> 32:26.244
But my brother doesn't even
do anything. This is crazy.

32:26.403 --> 32:27.950
<i>And here's the most important thing.</i>

32:29.656 --> 32:30.623
Okay-

32:30.782 --> 32:35.162
<i>Her clothes could have forensic proof
of her distributing her brother's stash.</i>

32:35.328 --> 32:37.046
<i>That's why it's important
you take them to the car</i>

32:37.205 --> 32:40.880
<i>so we have time to test them
before taking her away.</i>

32:41.042 --> 32:44.546
<i>If you do this, you will build our case.
You understand?</i>

32:44.713 --> 32:45.714
Yes.

33:01.021 --> 33:02.364
We don't
have no pickles either.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.025
Sandra! Are you or Marti
gonna come help?

33:05.192 --> 33:06.444
I'm on the register by myself.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.908
Okay, one of us will be right out.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.118
Let me just finish this real quick.

33:11.281 --> 33:12.282
Oh, my God.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.668
Sari')!-

34:47.835 --> 34:50.259
Thank you.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.469
Excuse me, miss.

34:51.630 --> 34:54.804
I bought this sandwich for my daughter
with no pickles and mayo.

34:54.967 --> 34:55.889
It's loaded with mayo.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.052
- Okay.
- It's disgusting.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.640
No problem.
Just give me one second.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.819
I need a southwest ranch, no mayo.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.611
Is everything okay?

35:09.774 --> 35:12.027
Well, what do you think?
First the freezer thing.

35:12.193 --> 35:15.037
Then I tell you we could have
a QC visit from Franchise,

35:15.196 --> 35:17.665
and still we're getting the orders wrong.
Come on, Kevin.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.326
I'm making the sandwich.

35:25.123 --> 35:25.999
Wright?

35:26.166 --> 35:28.760
Hey, you know Connie's by herself
at the register, right?

35:28.918 --> 35:30.966
And we've got nobody
running food to drive-thru,

35:31.129 --> 35:32.551
and we're completely out of bacon.

35:32.714 --> 35:35.809
Well, I have Julio on drive-thru,
but you're right. It's very hectic,

35:35.967 --> 35:39.562
so why don't you go out now,
and I'm gonna come as soon as I can.

35:39.721 --> 35:40.563
Bye.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.395
Hello, Officer.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.356
<i>Did you put the clothes in the car,</i>

35:45.518 --> 35:47.065
<i>the 2000 Subaru?</i>

35:47.228 --> 35:50.732
Yes, I did. It's in the employee
parking in the back,

35:50.899 --> 35:53.869
and the passenger door is unlocked.

35:54.611 --> 35:55.578
<i>That's good. You're doing great.</i>

35:55.737 --> 35:58.115
<i>Like I said before,
I'm lucky I have you here tonight.</i>

35:58.281 --> 36:00.124
Well, thank you.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.752
<i>Have you ever been involved
in a situation like this before?</i>

36:02.911 --> 36:04.163
Oh, God, no.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.502
<i>Well, you could have fooled me.</i>

36:06.665 --> 36:10.340
<i>You're making a really difficult situation
run very smoothly, very professional.</i>

36:10.502 --> 36:12.004
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.218
Sandra! When we...
When are we doing the drop?

36:14.381 --> 36:15.702
I can't do that and the register.

36:15.715 --> 36:17.262
I'm coming now!

36:17.425 --> 36:19.644
Actually I'm feeling like I need
to get out there

36:19.803 --> 36:22.056
and do the job that Robbie
is paying me to do.

36:22.222 --> 36:23.769
When did you say
you were coming back?

36:23.932 --> 36:25.775
<i>Well, we're just in the middle
of searching the house.</i>

36:25.934 --> 36:27.607
<i>I need you to sit tight with me here.</i>

36:27.769 --> 36:29.112
<i>Do you have a problem doing that?</i>

36:29.270 --> 36:32.023
Well, it's just that I'm needed out front.
This is our busiest time.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.316
<i>Sure, sure.</i>

36:33.483 --> 36:36.282
<i>Really hate to do this to your night.</i>

36:36.444 --> 36:39.698
<i>Do you have an employee
that you trust to watch her,</i>

36:39.864 --> 36:42.242
<i>ideally a male for security reasons?</i>

36:42.951 --> 36:44.373
Yeah.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.708
I could get Kevin.

36:46.705 --> 36:50.335
And I could do sandwich board,
and I could get Brie to do the,

36:50.625 --> 36:52.377
bags going out. Okay, hold on.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.923
Is... Is this really needed?
I swear I'll be okay. I...

36:56.089 --> 36:59.059
Yes, it is needed,
until we get it figured out.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.093
When are they coming?

37:00.260 --> 37:02.433
I have no idea.

37:09.269 --> 37:12.113
Kevin, I need to pull you
from sandwich board.

37:12.272 --> 37:14.400
Julio and Brie, cover for him.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.910
I promise you I'll be right back.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.831
Hey, all right, so what...
what is going on?

38:05.575 --> 38:07.794
There's some upsetting news
about Becky.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.374
She stole from a customer,

38:09.537 --> 38:11.915
and she may be in trouble
for something with her brother.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.503
He's been in trouble
with the law.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.839
Wait. She stole something?

38:16.002 --> 38:17.345
Yes.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.472
No, I... I know her brother.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.850
He's not in... Wait. What?

38:22.967 --> 38:25.436
I can't talk about it right now.
It's all gonna be sorted out.

38:25.595 --> 38:29.816
What I need you for is to watch Becky
until the police get here.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.156
We had to strip-search her.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.908
Hello, Officer. I'm back.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.198
<i>Hey, how's it going out there?
Is it a madhouse?</i>

38:44.364 --> 38:47.117
Oh, yes, you guessed it.
It's a madhouse.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.786
Yes, I'm in the weeds.
That's the word.

38:49.953 --> 38:51.955
I've gotta get back out there,

38:52.121 --> 38:55.671
but I have Kevin here,
and he's gonna watch Becky.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.303
<i>- Yeah. Put him on now, okay?
- Okay, sure.</i>

38:58.461 --> 39:00.759
Just so you know,
I am gonna come back in

39:00.922 --> 39:02.082
and check... check on things,

39:02.215 --> 39:03.842
make sure everything's all right.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.601
<i>That sounds fair.</i>

39:07.095 --> 39:09.518
<i>You know, you're really being very helpful.</i>

39:09.681 --> 39:12.025
Well, it's no problem.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.810
Urn, so here's Kevin.

39:13.977 --> 39:18.699
This is Officer Daniels.
He'll tell you what to do.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.404
Hey, they're saying that you stole
from a customer

39:24.571 --> 39:25.932
and that your brother is arrested.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.915
- What?
- What did you do?

39:28.074 --> 39:29.121
I didn't...
I didn't do anything.

39:29.284 --> 39:32.003
This is crazy. I'm naked.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.083
Hello.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.797
<i>Is this Kevin?</i>

39:38.960 --> 39:40.086
Yeah. Yeah.

39:40.253 --> 39:41.254
Kevin, this is Officer Daniels.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.219
I'm the lead officer in the case.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.224
Has your manager explained what's going on?

39:45.383 --> 39:50.014
<i>Well, she said that Becky stole something
and her brother's arrested.</i>

39:51.180 --> 39:53.182
Sandra told you about her brother?

39:53.349 --> 39:56.068
<i>Yeah... Well, she said he's in trouble.</i>

39:56.227 --> 39:58.070
<i>Well, what did he do?</i>

39:58.229 --> 40:01.233
Yeah, well, we'll get to the brother
in a second.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.027
That's really a very serious police matter.

40:04.193 --> 40:10.542
What we are interested in
in the moment is Becky and this theft.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.707
And what is the theft?

40:13.870 --> 40:18.717
<i>Well, I have a customer here with me
that says her purse was taken.</i>

40:18.875 --> 40:21.924
Ye... Well, you know,
I was out there the whole time,

40:22.086 --> 40:26.592
and, you know, I didn't see anyone
complain about a purse being stolen.

40:27.175 --> 40:29.052
<i>Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
You're right. Excuse me.</i>

40:29.218 --> 40:31.437
Not her purse.
Money from her purse.

40:31.596 --> 40:32.973
She says that Becky...

40:33.139 --> 40:35.016
It was on the counter, the purse,

40:35.183 --> 40:37.732
and Becky stuck her hand in
and snatched it out.

40:37.894 --> 40:40.568
<i>Okay, I don't understand
how that could be possible,</i>

40:40.730 --> 40:43.449
because there were, like,
a ton of people out there.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.782
Well, I don't really have the time
to debate it with you, son.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.700
<i>I have</i> a <i>surveillance unit saying</i>
<i>they can corroborate the victim's story.</i>

40:50.865 --> 40:53.539
<i>What our issue at hand is,
where is the money?</i>

40:53.701 --> 40:54.748
<i>You see?</i>

40:54.911 --> 40:57.881
<i>Does she have anything
in her pockets?</i>

41:00.375 --> 41:02.343
What?

41:02.502 --> 41:05.301
<i>What is the suspect
wearing at this time?</i>

41:07.924 --> 41:12.475
I... You know, she doesn't really have
pockets to have anything in.

41:12.637 --> 41:13.980
<i>And why is that?</i>

41:16.391 --> 41:18.769
<i>Dude, you all strip-searched her.</i>

41:18.935 --> 41:20.608
<i>She's wearing an apron right now.</i>

41:20.770 --> 41:22.443
Okay. Why don't you calm down?

41:22.605 --> 41:24.699
I'm gonna need you to inspect her.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.781
What?

41:27.944 --> 41:30.948
<i>Kevin, why don't you stop laughing,
and calm down, okay?</i>

41:31.114 --> 41:33.162
W-What the fuck are you talking about?

41:33.324 --> 41:35.793
<i>I am an officer of the law, okay?</i>

41:35.952 --> 41:39.627
<i>I'm gonna need you to address me
as a sir, understand?</i>

41:42.083 --> 41:44.006
<i>All right, Kevin...</i>

41:44.502 --> 41:46.675
<i>we need to find this money.</i>

41:47.755 --> 41:50.884
<i>I'm gonna need to have her
remove the apron,</i>

41:51.050 --> 41:53.269
<i>and you search her body.</i>

41:59.350 --> 42:00.977
<i>He's trying to get me...</i>

42:01.144 --> 42:04.398
He's saying he wants me
to get you to take off the apron

42:04.564 --> 42:06.942
and inspect your whole body.

42:11.070 --> 42:12.037
I already did...

42:12.780 --> 42:13.861
I already did that. That's...

42:13.865 --> 42:15.367
Yeah, bro, this is fucked.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.659
I'm sorry.

42:16.826 --> 42:19.329
<i>It might seem a little strange, I know,</i>

42:19.495 --> 42:21.418
<i>but I'm still an officer of the law.</i>

42:21.581 --> 42:24.460
You need to listen to me
for your own sake.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.751
This is procedure.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.421
Yeah, well, it's a fucked procedure.

42:28.588 --> 42:31.057
Okay, you need to watch your mouth, son.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.809
Sorry.

42:34.343 --> 42:37.392
Look, I gotta...
I gotta leave in a second.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.978
Okay, but let me ask you one more thing.
Were you two ever an item?

42:40.141 --> 42:42.360
Wha...

42:43.394 --> 42:44.566
What are you doing?

42:44.729 --> 42:46.857
You can't make me do that shit.

42:47.023 --> 42:48.696
Talk to me. Come on.

42:51.694 --> 42:53.037
Look, I'm not saying it was me
with the freezer,

42:53.196 --> 42:54.676
but I admit that's my responsibility,

42:54.739 --> 42:56.116
but that... that is not my job.

42:56.282 --> 42:58.580
Jesus, Kevin, can I not count
on you for anything?

42:58.743 --> 43:00.871
Becky is my friend.
When the cops come,

43:01.037 --> 43:03.335
I don't want anything to do with it.

43:08.878 --> 43:12.223
- What the hell happened?
- He didn't think it was fair.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.178
Hello.

43:16.344 --> 43:18.517
<i>Sandra, this isn't working out with Kevin.</i>

43:18.679 --> 43:22.775
<i>I do not approve of him
as the main security before I arrive.</i>

43:22.934 --> 43:24.106
What happened?

43:24.268 --> 43:25.611
<i>Well, nothing good.</i>

43:25.770 --> 43:28.148
<i>He's completely disobedient
and unprofessional.</i>

43:28.314 --> 43:29.907
Well, he's always like that.

43:30.066 --> 43:33.661
Is he? You have to put up with
a lot of stuff from him?

43:33.820 --> 43:36.289
<i>Well, I mean, he's fine.
I mean, he's a good kid.</i>

43:36.447 --> 43:39.747
<i>You know, he %... he% fine. Just...
It%...</i>

43:39.909 --> 43:42.037
Should I have my people
start watching him?

43:42.286 --> 43:44.084
<i>You think he could be wrapped up
in the same stuff Becky is?</i>

43:44.247 --> 43:48.377
Oh, goodness, no. No, no, no.
Nothing like that, no.

43:48.543 --> 43:50.386
<i>But he gives you hell?</i>

43:50.545 --> 43:52.764
Yeah, he does,
like you can't imagine.

43:52.922 --> 43:56.017
<i>I'm sorry.
It must be a real pain.</i>

43:56.175 --> 44:02.353
Hey, listen. Kevin said
that you told him about Becky's brother

44:02.515 --> 44:04.563
even though I said it was confidential.

44:06.519 --> 44:08.567
Oh, you know, I don't...

44:09.438 --> 44:11.190
I don't think I said much, though, did I?

44:11.357 --> 44:13.155
- You know, the last thing <i>I</i> need...
- I may have mentioned it.

44:13.317 --> 44:14.569
The last thing I need

44:14.735 --> 44:17.534
<i>is someone on my side
with a big mouth, Sandra.</i>

44:17.697 --> 44:19.199
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

44:19.365 --> 44:21.083
<i>If you can't cooperate with me here...</i>

44:21.242 --> 44:22.118
I'm sorry.

44:22.285 --> 44:24.208
<i>I need to be able to trust you.</i>

44:24.370 --> 44:25.587
Right.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.006
I'm very sorry...

44:27.165 --> 44:29.042
- Just <i>be quiet.</i>
- ...you know.

44:29.208 --> 44:33.213
Either you need to watch her,
or we need to find someone reliable.

44:33.379 --> 44:39.512
<i>Yeah, I could watch her,
but the thing is, it's so busy out there.</i>

44:39.677 --> 44:42.055
No, no, no, I know.
You have a restaurant to run.

44:42.221 --> 44:44.315
- We've asked too much of you already.
- Yeah.

44:44.891 --> 44:49.067
Just wish I could spare one flippin'
officer, just someone to run over.

44:49.228 --> 44:50.400
<i>Yeah, can't you, or...</i>

44:50.563 --> 44:51.564
Unfortunately, no.

44:51.731 --> 44:54.484
<i>It has to be someone new
on your end.</i>

44:54.650 --> 44:57.620
Well, you know,

44:57.778 --> 45:01.157
I could get Marti, but, see,
Marti's needed out there, too.

45:01.324 --> 45:02.701
<i>- Right, right, right.
- You know?</i>

45:02.867 --> 45:05.040
<i>Well, let me ask you a question.</i>

45:05.203 --> 45:06.580
<i>Are you married?</i>

45:06.746 --> 45:10.842
No, but I'm...
I'm gonna be soon.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.253
You're engaged?

45:13.419 --> 45:15.012
Yeah, I am.

45:15.171 --> 45:17.173
<i>Oh, well, that's great. Congrats.</i>

45:17.340 --> 45:18.387
Well, thanks, yeah.

45:18.549 --> 45:19.675
<i>Terrific.</i>

45:19.842 --> 45:22.721
Well, do you trust him?

45:22.887 --> 45:24.560
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

45:24.722 --> 45:26.895
Well, what's he up to?

45:27.058 --> 45:28.901
You think he could come by and help?

45:36.192 --> 45:37.193
<i>Do you think...</i>

45:37.360 --> 45:40.614
Yeah, it's a little unstandard,
I know. Jeez.

45:40.780 --> 45:42.578
But it'd really help me out.

45:42.740 --> 45:43.582
<i>Yeah.</i>

45:43.741 --> 45:45.835
It would help you. Okay.

45:45.993 --> 45:48.371
Well, I would have to call him,

45:48.537 --> 45:50.756
and I would just have to see if he,

45:50.915 --> 45:53.759
<i>you know, could come.</i>

45:53.918 --> 45:55.044
Great.

45:55.211 --> 45:56.929
Why don't you do that for me, then?

46:39.630 --> 46:43.635
So the officer's name is Daniels,
and we're just waiting on them.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.849
So who is it again?

46:46.012 --> 46:47.229
Are you drunk?

46:47.388 --> 46:48.685
No.

46:48.848 --> 46:51.442
I already told you it's
Becky from the front.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.318
That little blonde girl?

46:53.477 --> 46:54.945
Yeah.

47:01.068 --> 47:04.038
Becky? You remember Van, don't you?

47:04.196 --> 47:05.243
Yeah. Hey.

47:05.406 --> 47:07.079
- Hey.
- Well, he's gonna sit with you

47:07.241 --> 47:09.539
until they come, okay?

47:09.702 --> 47:11.875
Do we really have to do this?

47:12.747 --> 47:14.624
Honey, it's not up to me.

47:14.790 --> 47:15.666
Hello, Officer?

47:15.833 --> 47:17.460
- Yeah.
- I have Van here,

47:17.626 --> 47:19.879
and I'm gonna hand the phone
over to him,

47:20.046 --> 47:22.424
and then I'm gonna get back
out there, okay?

47:22.590 --> 47:23.637
<i>That'd be great.</i>

47:23.799 --> 47:24.971
Okay, here he is.

47:25.134 --> 47:26.135
Here's... Here's Van.

47:29.221 --> 47:30.143
Hello.

47:30.306 --> 47:31.523
Hello. Who's this?

47:31.682 --> 47:33.605
<i>This is Evan Balcer.</i>

47:33.768 --> 47:38.274
Evan Balcer, A-L-C-E-R?

47:38.439 --> 47:40.282
Do you want a Diet Coke, hon?
Diet Coke?

47:40.441 --> 47:42.239
<i>- Sandra, how much longer?
- You're what, her boyfriend?</i>

47:42.401 --> 47:43.323
- Yeah.
- Honey, I don't know.

47:43.486 --> 47:44.658
<i>- Do you have a date?
- Not really, no.</i>

47:44.820 --> 47:45.992
What do you want to drink?

47:46.155 --> 47:47.657
<i>All right, Evan,
you got a real fine lady...</i>

47:47.823 --> 47:49.075
- Diet Coke is okay.
- In Sandra there.

47:49.241 --> 47:50.868
Thanks.

47:51.035 --> 47:52.537
<i>Yeah. So what do you do?</i>

47:52.703 --> 47:54.000
<i>Y-You're a general contractor?</i>

47:54.163 --> 47:55.380
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

47:55.748 --> 47:57.375
You don't work at the ChickWich?

47:57.541 --> 47:58.793
- No.
- Not even part-time?

47:58.959 --> 48:00.802
Nah.

48:00.961 --> 48:02.679
<i>And what was
your whereabouts tonight?</i>

48:02.838 --> 48:03.714
What were you doing?

48:03.881 --> 48:05.428
It was a long day at work,

48:05.591 --> 48:08.765
so I just hung out with some buddies
at their... their house, you know.

48:08.928 --> 48:10.521
<i>Man, you got dragged in here?</i>

48:10.679 --> 48:11.805
I did, yeah.

48:11.972 --> 48:15.351
<i>Well, get used to it. That's the way
it's gonna be once you get married.</i>

48:15.518 --> 48:16.986
They never let you out.

48:17.144 --> 48:19.693
All right, Evan.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.531
You ready to do this? She fill you in
on everything we need to do here?

48:23.609 --> 48:24.906
Not really, no.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.117
She... she said I just
had to sit here and wait.

48:27.279 --> 48:29.953
<i>Well, I bet she told you
Becky stole money.</i>

48:30.116 --> 48:31.083
Pardon me?

48:31.242 --> 48:32.915
<i>She told you Becky stole the money?</i>

48:33.077 --> 48:33.919
Right.

48:34.078 --> 48:35.671
<i>BOY-</i>

48:35.830 --> 48:40.006
Well, I'm in charge of the crime scene
and everything that happens here,

48:40.167 --> 48:42.215
and you're gonna assist me, okay?

48:43.212 --> 48:45.431
I... I guess so.

48:45.589 --> 48:46.556
Okay-

48:46.715 --> 48:50.345
And the first thing we need to do
is find that money she took.

48:51.053 --> 48:51.975
Okay-

48:52.138 --> 48:53.890
<i>I'm gonna need you to inspect her.</i>

48:54.056 --> 48:56.275
<i>Does she still have that apron on?</i>

48:56.851 --> 48:58.398
Yep.

48:59.437 --> 49:01.155
Yeah, why don't we start by...

49:01.564 --> 49:03.111
having her take that off.

49:10.489 --> 49:12.833
He says you gotta take off the apron.

49:12.992 --> 49:13.959
What?

49:14.118 --> 49:14.960
<i>Oh, and, Evan,</i>

49:15.119 --> 49:19.215
if she won't take it off I'm gonna
need you to take it from her.

49:19.373 --> 49:21.091
We gotta find the money that you took.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.594
Someone else already
made me take it off.

49:23.752 --> 49:24.878
I'm naked. The...

49:25.045 --> 49:26.718
<i>And we have to find that money.</i>

49:26.881 --> 49:28.883
<i>Did she-Has she taken it off yet?</i>

49:29.049 --> 49:33.429
No. She said somebody already asked her
and that she doesn't have the money.

49:33.846 --> 49:35.439
She's naked.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.022
You believe everything a thief says?

49:39.643 --> 49:40.643
Evan, you're a grown man.

49:40.769 --> 49:43.488
You think a naked girl doesn't
have a place to hide money?

49:45.399 --> 49:47.072
- Well, I just... I don't...
- Yeah.

49:47.234 --> 49:49.953
<i>I want you to see her without that apron.</i>

49:50.112 --> 49:51.739
<i>I'm gonna need you to describe her body.</i>

49:51.906 --> 49:54.910
Hey, Sandra,

49:55.075 --> 49:56.167
can't we have Marti come back here?

49:56.327 --> 49:59.957
Honey, why are you making this
more difficult than it has to be?

50:00.122 --> 50:02.295
Can you hold on a second, Officer?

50:02.458 --> 50:03.459
All right.

50:06.253 --> 50:08.301
Is this okay to be doing?

50:08.464 --> 50:09.431
What do you mean?

50:09.590 --> 50:12.059
I don't know. It... I don't get it.

50:12.968 --> 50:14.289
I mean, you gotta find the money?

50:15.262 --> 50:16.388
Well, yeah, of course.

50:16.555 --> 50:17.522
Is that what he said?

50:17.681 --> 50:18.523
Yeah.

50:18.682 --> 50:19.979
What is he saying?

50:21.477 --> 50:22.694
Jesus, Van.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.696
How many beers have you had?

50:24.855 --> 50:26.528
Let me talk to him.

50:28.692 --> 50:29.534
Hello, Officer?

50:29.693 --> 50:30.569
Yes.

50:30.736 --> 50:32.329
How... How's he doing?

50:32.488 --> 50:36.413
<i>He's doing great, just really great,
almost as sweet and helpful as you.</i>

50:36.575 --> 50:38.373
So he's better than Kevin.

50:38.536 --> 50:39.708
- He's...
- Oh, yeah.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.213
Yeah. He's not giving you any trouble?

50:41.372 --> 50:43.795
No, no, no.
We were doing just great.

50:43.958 --> 50:44.925
<i>Okay, great.</i>

50:45.084 --> 50:47.963
Well, then, I'm gonna go ahead
and hand the phone back to Van,

50:48.128 --> 50:49.755
and I'm gonna get back out there.

50:49.922 --> 50:51.299
<i>- Okay, you do that.
- Okay.</i>

50:59.640 --> 51:00.482
Yeah, this is Van.

51:00.641 --> 51:01.962
Can't just, like, you or Marti...

51:01.976 --> 51:03.398
Can I come sit with you guys out there...

51:03.561 --> 51:04.983
<i>- Is Sandra still there?
- Yeah.</i>

51:05.145 --> 51:06.738
Where I can wait or something
in the employee area?

51:06.897 --> 51:09.025
Well, honey, what are you gonna do,
walk through the dining room?

51:09.191 --> 51:10.613
<i>She's talking to Becky or...?</i>

51:10.776 --> 51:12.494
- This isn't going to go on much longer.
- Yeah.

51:12.653 --> 51:15.657
Here. Have something to drink, okay?
You'll be all right?

51:15.823 --> 51:18.167
<i>Yeah. Well, you know,
these are sensitive matters.</i>

51:18.325 --> 51:20.419
<i>It's probably better</i>
<i>to let them talk about it</i>

51:20.578 --> 51:23.798
<i>before we
do what we need to do here.</i>

51:25.791 --> 51:27.634
Okay.

51:28.794 --> 51:31.092
Is Sandra still there?

51:31.255 --> 51:33.303
<i>Yeah, she left.</i>

51:34.800 --> 51:36.598
Is she coming back any time soon?

51:37.511 --> 51:38.933
I don't know.

51:39.888 --> 51:41.890
- I don't think so.
- 'Kay.

51:42.057 --> 51:44.230
Then you need
to tell Becky to take it off.

51:44.893 --> 51:47.066
And, look, I work with
troubled teens all the time.

51:47.229 --> 51:48.230
There's usually some resistance,

51:48.397 --> 51:51.617
<i>but... usually they just want to help.</i>

51:51.775 --> 51:54.028
<i>They want to do the right thing, so just...</i>

51:54.194 --> 51:56.288
<i>This is what works.
Be stern with her.</i>

51:56.447 --> 51:58.290
Don't give her a choice.

51:58.449 --> 51:59.621
Go ahead.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.043
Please, don't. This is craz...

52:05.205 --> 52:06.798
Just don't make me do this.

52:06.957 --> 52:07.879
This is crazy.

52:08.042 --> 52:10.716
<i>Let me talk to Becky.</i>

52:11.670 --> 52:13.013
He wants to talk to you.

52:17.343 --> 52:18.686
Hello.

52:20.054 --> 52:22.898
So I want you to do me a favor

52:23.057 --> 52:25.401
and look around at where you are.

52:26.894 --> 52:28.896
That's where you are.

52:31.190 --> 52:33.784
<i>Where we are is at your house,</i>

52:33.942 --> 52:36.445
<i>searching it for your brother's drugs.</i>

52:37.488 --> 52:38.609
My brother doesn't do drugs.

52:38.739 --> 52:41.083
<i>Enough. Enough.</i>

52:41.700 --> 52:43.293
<i>Shut up.</i>

52:45.537 --> 52:48.757
We have you with witnesses
stealing from the restaurant.

52:48.916 --> 52:50.543
You aren't cooperating.

52:50.709 --> 52:53.963
You aren't helping us
conduct our investigation.

52:54.129 --> 52:55.722
It's not good.

52:59.677 --> 53:02.226
All right, looks like
we're gonna have to take you in.

53:06.141 --> 53:07.643
<i>They'll look at your criminal record,</i>

53:08.394 --> 53:11.318
<i>determine how many hours
you're gonna spend there in the jail.</i>

53:11.480 --> 53:13.482
I don't have a criminal record.

53:14.608 --> 53:19.364
I'm just saying they'll look
at your criminal record or lack of,

53:19.530 --> 53:21.749
look at your papers,

53:22.574 --> 53:25.748
decide how many hours
you'll spend in jail. Okay?

53:31.291 --> 53:33.214
<i>I mean, they are gonna haul you in.</i>

53:33.377 --> 53:36.847
<i>They'll look at how you
cooperated here, today.</i>

53:37.005 --> 53:39.679
<i>I mean, all this is being recorded.</i>

53:40.426 --> 53:41.598
<i>You understand?</i>

53:53.230 --> 53:55.574
Yeah, I understand.

53:57.526 --> 54:01.076
But, sir, why?

54:02.656 --> 54:05.660
<i>Why? Why are you going to jail?</i>

54:06.326 --> 54:09.170
<i>Because you're the one
that's causing all the problems.</i>

54:11.206 --> 54:17.430
<i>Now, if you want this over with
sooner rather than later,</i>

54:18.213 --> 54:21.808
<i>you'll allow the person that I authorized</i>

54:21.967 --> 54:25.016
to inspect you, to search you.

54:25.179 --> 54:26.772
And then, maybe then...

54:28.557 --> 54:30.685
you'll have a chance of
getting out of this.

54:37.649 --> 54:39.117
You understand what I'm saying?

54:39.276 --> 54:41.699
You can go to jail,
or you can let this guy inspect you.

54:41.862 --> 54:44.331
You can go to jail, or you can
let this guy inspect you.

54:44.490 --> 54:46.709
That's it, two choices.

54:50.954 --> 54:51.955
<i>- You're gonna do this?
- Okay.</i>

54:52.122 --> 54:53.749
You're gonna take off the apron?

54:56.877 --> 54:58.550
Yeah.

54:58.712 --> 55:00.305
You're gonna take it off?

55:01.799 --> 55:03.142
Yes.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.598
Great. Thank you.

55:06.678 --> 55:08.351
You're doing great.

55:09.306 --> 55:12.560
So just take off the apron
and give the phone back to Van, okay?

55:25.739 --> 55:26.911
This is Van.

55:27.074 --> 55:29.042
<i>How'd that work?
She take off the apron?</i>

55:29.868 --> 55:31.415
She is now.

55:33.247 --> 55:35.625
<i>Well, what does her chest look like?</i>

55:37.209 --> 55:41.259
Well, she's covering it with the apron.

55:42.214 --> 55:45.434
<i>I thought you said she took it off.
Take it from her.</i>

55:50.389 --> 55:53.689
He says I gotta take the apron from you.

56:07.531 --> 56:09.625
<i>How big are her nipples?</i>

56:13.871 --> 56:15.839
Why? I mean...

56:15.998 --> 56:17.841
<i>You're my eyes on the ground.</i>

56:18.000 --> 56:20.298
<i>Anything that can corroborate
the witness' testimony.</i>

56:20.460 --> 56:23.509
<i>I just need to know
any identifying marks, scars, tattoos.</i>

56:23.672 --> 56:25.674
Yeah, but...

56:28.760 --> 56:30.808
You gotta lower your arms.

56:38.437 --> 56:40.155
I don't know. I...

56:40.314 --> 56:42.988
<i>Average, I guess.</i>

56:45.068 --> 56:47.662
All right, I need you
to do me a favor.

56:47.821 --> 56:49.982
We need to find out
if she's hiding any money up there,

56:49.990 --> 56:53.995
so I want you to tell her
to turn around and bend over.

56:55.037 --> 56:56.163
Why?

56:56.330 --> 56:58.003
<i>That's just a standard cavity search.</i>

56:58.165 --> 57:00.008
<i>You've probably seen that on TV,</i>

57:00.167 --> 57:01.919
<i>at the airport even sometimes, just to...</i>

57:02.085 --> 57:03.052
All right.

57:03.211 --> 57:05.805
<i>See if she's holding anything
in any of her orifices.</i>

57:05.964 --> 57:07.090
All right. All right.

57:09.551 --> 57:12.600
He says you have to turn around
and you have to bend over

57:13.639 --> 57:16.358
so I can see if there's
anything up in there.

57:18.226 --> 57:19.398
Turn around.

57:19.561 --> 57:23.191
<i>You know, it might help if you just...
you make her call you sir</i>

57:23.357 --> 57:24.637
<i>and tell her to hold her ankles.</i>

57:25.734 --> 57:26.701
Why?

57:26.860 --> 57:28.487
<i>Well, she's gonna respect the authority.</i>

57:28.654 --> 57:31.908
<i>If not, she's just gonna run
ramshod all over you.</i>

57:33.408 --> 57:35.581
He says you have to call me sir

57:36.286 --> 57:40.041
so that when I ask you to do something,
I know you're gonna do it.

57:40.207 --> 57:42.209
All right?

57:42.376 --> 57:43.628
Yes, sir.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.382
<i>What's...</i>

57:48.548 --> 57:51.097
<i>What's that look like?
Is she shaved?</i>

57:51.259 --> 57:53.637
I don't know. I guess she's...

57:53.804 --> 57:57.229
It's trimmed, I guess.

57:57.391 --> 58:00.315
It's shaved. I just...
it's just been a couple days.

58:00.477 --> 58:01.979
She said it's actually shaved.

58:02.145 --> 58:04.648
Who said? She said that?

58:04.815 --> 58:05.782
<i>Yeah.</i>

58:06.942 --> 58:07.909
Nice work, Evan.

58:08.068 --> 58:10.070
We need to deputize you?

58:13.907 --> 58:16.535
Can I give her the... the apron back now?

58:16.702 --> 58:17.874
<i>No.</i>

58:20.455 --> 58:22.583
Boy, it really must be stuck up there.

58:22.749 --> 58:27.300
Okay, we have a special
procedure that we do in this case.

58:27.462 --> 58:30.591
Have her turn around.

58:30.757 --> 58:32.225
<i>She is around.</i>

58:32.384 --> 58:34.261
Okay-

58:35.387 --> 58:37.588
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to have her
do jumping jacks...

58:38.765 --> 58:40.233
to try and shake it out.

58:43.603 --> 58:45.981
Have her jog in place or do jumping jacks

58:46.148 --> 58:49.027
to see if we can get the money dislodged.

58:53.363 --> 58:54.831
I don't know.

58:54.990 --> 58:57.960
<i>What were you doing tonight?
Have a few beers?</i>

58:58.118 --> 58:59.870
You weren't driving, were you?

59:01.788 --> 59:03.836
<i>Jesus Christ, Evan,</i>

59:03.999 --> 59:07.048
<i>we need that money as soon
as possible, understand?</i>

59:08.754 --> 59:10.301
He says you gotta do jumping jacks.

59:11.339 --> 59:12.886
What?

59:13.050 --> 59:14.393
To shake it out.

59:16.970 --> 59:18.563
This is so stupid.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.565
I know.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.101
<i>We need that money.</i>

59:22.267 --> 59:25.020
<i>I don't want you
to have to answer for it, too.</i>

59:26.396 --> 59:27.989
Just do it. Just...

59:49.836 --> 59:52.339
All right, my front line,
get your drawers ready!

59:52.506 --> 59:54.884
Drop in two minutes.

59:57.677 --> 59:59.520
Dude, I just texted my friend,

59:59.679 --> 01:00:02.808
and he thinks her brother's
not even in town right now.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.226
It's just messed up.

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:08.363
I don't know. Go on back there if you want,
but I ain't messin' with no cops.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:11.071
That fall under shit
that ain't none of my business.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.361
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.790
What's it look like from there, Evan?

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:24.713
<i>What's it like to have
a front-row seat to the show?</i>

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:27.381
Come on.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:31.302
How's everybody doing in here?

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:35.049
Nothing.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:36.846
What?

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.138
We're just waiting. That's all.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.524
What?! What are you waiting for?
I don't underst...

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:48.896
W-When are they coming?

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:49.938
I don't know.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:51.845
Well, let me talk to him, then.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.485
Let me talk to him.
Give me the phone.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:58.284
Hello, Officer Daniels.
How is it going?

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:01.370
<i>Oh, great. How you doing?
You busy out there?</i>

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.035
Yeah, I'm busy as ever.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:04.578
It's a great night.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:06.417
Sandra, you gotta help me.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.923
Why are you talking to me?

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.584
Can you see I'm on the phone?
Sit down!

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.430
I have to get back out there
to the restaurant.

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:20.140
Do you... ls Van still...
still being a sweetie?

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:21.645
<i>Oh, yeah. He b-Heb been great.</i>

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.682
Oh, good. So I'm gonna
give him back the phone.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:25.895
Sounds good.

01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:28.276
- I'll see you when you come.
- Okay.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:30.358
Sandra, please, I can't do this.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.648
What are you...
What are you doing, honey?

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:33.815
- They can't make me do this.
- Stop talking.

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:34.824
You're gonna be fine.

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:36.985
Hello. This is Van.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:38.995
<i>Hey, Van...</i>

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:41.327
sounds like Sandra's running around

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:42.706
like a chicken
with her head cut off?

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:43.992
<i>I... I guess so.</i>

01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:45.536
Yes, I'm sure it's busy in there.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:48.922
Listen, I'm not sure when
you guys are coming.

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:51.542
Is Sandra still in there?

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:52.880
She just left.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.966
<i>You have one minute
left on this card.</i>

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.004
<i>- Shit.
- What?</i>

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:57.013
<i>Are you coming?</i>

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:58.799
Fuck me. God damn it. Hello?

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:00.182
Shit.

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:01.969
Fuck.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:04.934
Hello? Officer Daniels,
are you there?

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:07.565
Hey. I got a situation here
at Rebecca's house, Evan.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:08.976
If I lose you...

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.189
Do you want to call back?

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:13.356
<i>You have 30 seconds left on this card.</i>

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:14.522
<i>Hello?</i>

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:29.247
Hey, what the hell
is he doing back there?

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:31.047
It's her fiancÃ©.
They're getting married.

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:34.050
Yeah, well, it's kinda fucked up
that he's back there alone with Becky,

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:36.007
especially since she's
half-naked like that.

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:39.093
I told her I didn't like the idea
of taking the clothes out to the car.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:41.725
Yeah, well, I told her
I didn't like the whole thing.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:43.226
Th-Those cops are fucked.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:44.386
Yeah.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.521
<i>- Okay, I'm back.
- Hello?</i>

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.057
<i>Hello? You there?
Can you hear me?</i>

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:49.555
<i>- Yeah.
- Sorry about that.</i>

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.200
<i>Had to deal with inspection of her home.</i>

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:52.870
<i>Things just got very serious over here.</i>

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.062
So where were we?

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:56.030
Did you scold her
for her insubordination yet?

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:57.899
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

01:02:58.066 --> 01:02:59.488
Well, you gotta get on that.

01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:00.903
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:03.949
<i>I need you to give her a spanking
'cause she was talking smack to Sandra,</i>

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:06.583
<i>but I need to explain it to her first.</i>

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:10.003
<i>You know?</i>

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:15.424
You mean...

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:17.801
- Can you <i>tell</i> her that?
- ...actually do that?

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:20.081
- Yeah. <i>I</i> need you to do that...
- Yeah, I can tell...

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.251
<i>but I need to tell her that.</i>

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.221
He says you were disobeying

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:25.977
because you were talking
to Sandra like that.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:28.104
Can you put her on for me?

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.436
<i>He wants to talk to you.</i>

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.228
<i>I didn't do anything, sir.</i>

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:38.194
<i>Didn't we talk about you
going easy on Sandra?</i>

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:42.361
<i>That all this would be hard on her?
Did we not?</i>

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:44.029
Yes, sir.

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.412
<i>What about me, Rebecca?</i>

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:48.746
<i>Do you even understand
how hard this is on me?</i>

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:51.081
You think I like situations like this?

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:54.248
No. I don't. Nobody does.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:59.341
<i>Would you agree with me
that you're disobeying?</i>

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.425
<i>You'd agree with me, right?</i>

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.384
I guess. Yes, sir.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.053
<i>Good. Then you'd be right.</i>

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:10.472
What used to happen
when you've been bad?

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:13.642
When you were a kid,
you'd get a spanking, right?

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.566
<i>Okay.</i>

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:20.357
Evan will have to spank you, right?

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:21.900
For being bad.

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:24.194
<i>And then you can do
something nice for him.</i>

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.534
<i>Can you do that?
Can you take your punishment</i>

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:30.041
<i>and do something nice
for his assisting the police?</i>

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.077
Yes, sir.

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:33.540
<i>Good girl.</i>

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.673
Now I want you to give him
back the phone.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.184
It's Van.

01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:49.219
<i>Evan, you there?</i>

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:50.228
Yes.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:54.563
<i>Okay, well, I talked to her, and she
understands she did something wrong,</i>

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:58.187
<i>and you're gonna need to spank her.
Can you do that?</i>

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.028
- Yeah. I can do that.
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:10.081
<i>But, hey, I don't want you
to just pat her, you know?</i>

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.039
This isn't patty-cakes here.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.708
I really want you to...

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:21.752
I want you to send a message
that this behavior will not be tolerated.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:22.919
<i>All right.</i>

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:26.848
Hard and long,

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:28.390
for a really long time.

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:29.972
<i>I don't want you to stop</i>

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:33.480
<i>until you know that you got
your message across.</i>

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.436
<i>And lay the phone real close,</i>

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.521
real close so <i>I</i> can hear.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:46.614
You want me to
lay the phone on her back

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:49.536
so you can hear?

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:53.117
Yeah, that's an excellent idea.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:56.002
Just... Yeah, lay the phone
right on her back.

01:05:56.161 --> 01:05:57.162
<i>All right.</i>

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.419
<i>All right, what?</i>

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:04.923
All right...

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.223
sir.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:10.634
Good.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:14.020
<i>Okay, and then we'll have her
do something...</i>

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:17.228
<i>really nice for you,
thank you for all your...</i>

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:19.813
<i>help and patience in this matter, okay?</i>

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.649
You go ahead <i>now.</i>

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:28.110
So he says you have
to bend over my lap.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.827
Come on.

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:39.913
Come on.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:47.216
Come here.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.397
Here you go.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.525
So what's going on
with the situation in back?

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.318
Just waiting for them to come.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:45.319
What's Van doing?

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:47.947
He's guarding her till they get here,
just sitting back there.

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:51.656
Well, when it slows down out here,
you want me to go sit with her?

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.821
Maybe. We'll see.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:56.865
Hi! Can I take your order?

01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:04.685
<i>What's going on, Evan?</i>

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:06.192
<i>Talk to me, buddy!</i>

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:12.024
<i>This doesn't work
unless you talk to me.</i>

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.158
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:15.238
<i>- Hey, guys...
- Evan, you there?</i>

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:18.325
I brought you something to eat.

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:22.825
What's going on in here?

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.585
Why aren't you on the phone?

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:30.375
Did he hang up?

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.224
Officer Daniels?

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:39.850
<i>Sandra, hello there.</i>

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.135
What's going on?

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:42.474
Is everything okay?

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:46.483
<i>Sandra, we've exhausted your poor fiancÃ©</i>
<i>with all the waiting.</i>

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.689
<i>I think it's time
we let him go home.</i>

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.194
Oh, yeah?

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:52.274
Why? Is there a problem?

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:53.689
<i>No, no, he's been great, but...</i>

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:55.742
God damn it, what happened?

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.197
<i>I don't think it's his fault.
He just hasn't been able</i>

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.327
<i>- to get all the information.
- I gotta go.</i>

01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:00.363
- Could you hold on a second?
- Sure.

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:07.916
Bye.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:14.253
Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:21.885
Oh, hey, Harold.
What are you doing back?

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:25.555
I thought I'd stop in for one
of those frosted thingies.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:26.814
All right.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:31.561
Oh, Harold. Harold, good.

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:32.775
Come with me.

01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:01.891
Hey, man, can I come over?

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.187
I did a bad thing.

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:12.207
What is all this now, ma'am?

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:13.997
Becky stole something,

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:17.337
and we have to watch her
until the police come.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.592
Becky stole?

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.127
Yeah, Becky stole something,

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.217
and we had to strip-search her,

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.257
and the regional manager is involved,

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:26.767
and it's been a very hard day.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.726
- Hello, Officer?
- Hello.

01:12:35.893 --> 01:12:37.987
I have Harold here with me.

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:40.065
- He normally works during the day.
- Hey, Becky.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.400
<i>Okay, so he's gonna watch Becky now?</i>

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:44.319
- Yes, that's right.
- Okay.

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:46.203
I'm gonna...

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:47.283
I'm gonna go out front,

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:48.327
see if I can call Van.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:49.456
<i>Okay, you do that.</i>

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:51.162
He... He just... I just took...

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:53.498
He just took off, you know.
I don't know.

01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:54.958
<i>Well, thaw...
You know, that's your problem.</i>

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:56.293
Right. Okay, well, here's...

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:59.334
Why don't you just let me talk to Harold
while you take care of that.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.922
Okay. Here's Harold.

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:03.258
This is Officer Daniels.

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:05.719
He'll tell you whatever it is
you need to know.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:08.809
Hello.

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:10.311
<i>Is Becky still in the room?</i>

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.312
She's right here. Where are you?

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:14.599
How is she dressed?

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:16.733
Pardon?

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:19.146
<i>She still have on an apron?</i>

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.655
That's right. Why?

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.613
<i>Harold, first thing we're gonna
have to do is take that off.</i>

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:27.028
<i>She stole money,
and we're gonna need to find it.</i>

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:28.036
<i>- Mister...
- She hid it up her...</i>

01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:30.072
I don't know who you are,

01:13:31.282 --> 01:13:33.876
but I don't think it's right to see
a lady like this in the buff.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:35.378
<i>Well, it's an investigation.</i>

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:36.958
<i>Harold, listen to me.</i>

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:40.921
<i>As an officer of the law,
I'm gonna need you to inspect her.</i>

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.255
<i>It's not your decision.</i>

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:44.637
Well, I'll be damned if it isn't.

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:46.923
Hey, did you hear from him yet?

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.432
I don't know what's going on.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:50.013
Harold, what's...
What are you doing out here?

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:51.856
You're supposed to be in there with Becky.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:53.928
That man's asking me
to do things that ain't right.

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:55.393
What?

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:59.060
He's asking me to take her apron off
and look at her...

01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:00.273
- It ain't right...
- What are you talking about?

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:01.436
And it ain't policemanly.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.438
- See?
- Shut up, Kevin.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.990
Robbie? Hey, it's Sandra.

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:10.154
<i>Sandra? From the South End store?</i>

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:13.666
Yes, sir. I'm calling
about that theft situation.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:15.167
<i>I'm sorry. What happened?</i>

01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:16.873
My employee that stole.

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:19.539
The officer said you'd been talking to him.

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:22.424
<i>The police? What happened?
I-I've been sick all day.</i>

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:24.256
<i>I've got that thing going around.</i>

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:27.422
You haven't been talking to Officer Daniels
on the other line?

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:29.135
<i>I haven't talked to anybody today.</i>

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.675
<i>You're the first person I've talked to.</i>

01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:31.842
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:35.597
<i>Should... Should I come in?</i>

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:42.562
- Hey, you okay?
- Who are you?

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.651
<i>Yes, I'll have
an original ChickWich,</i>

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.987
<i>and I'll have one of those
Frost Blenders.</i>

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.117
<i>I'm just kidding, Sandra. It's me.</i>

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:50.903
<i>Its Officer Daniels, messing with ya.</i>

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:58.661
Wait. He hung up?

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.421
Star-69.

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:29.903
Look, you must be exhausted.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:31.062
We spoke to your parents.

01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:33.190
They're gonna meet you,

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:36.861
and we can finish this
first thing in the morning, okay?

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:38.995
Have you always
worked under Sandra?

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:40.407
She hired me.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.792
How would you describe her
as a boss?

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.001
She's nice.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.163
Yeah? She usually look out
for her employees?

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:50.583
- 8 months, June 19...
- The backups for the whole system?

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:51.796
Yeah, and then...

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:55.129
One last question, though.

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:59.267
When they told you
you had to take your clothes off,

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:02.520
is there a reason
you didn't just say no?

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:05.644
I don't know.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:12.112
I just knew it was gonna happen.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:48.815
Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:49.850
- Hi!
- What do you got there?

01:18:50.017 --> 01:18:51.485
Here, let me take your coat off.

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:52.611
This is my bunny, Lovey.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:54.443
I got it at my grandpa's house.

01:18:54.605 --> 01:18:56.528
Oh, yeah?
You got it at grandpa's house?

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.364
And do you know
how many pockets he has?

01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:00.493
How many?

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:02.530
He... He has one pocket right here.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.448
- Just one?
- Did you know Lovey

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:06.492
got married to a mermaid named Lydia?

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.876
What the hell did they put in that chicken
made everyone lose their fucking minds?

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:13.257
First thing we gotta do,
find the caller.

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.758
- Okay.
- All right. And...

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.761
my best guess is the grocery

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.440
or the Boston Market
across the street.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:23.342
Ask around. See if they saw anybody
suspicious lingering on the phone

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:25.307
out in front of their stores for too long.

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:28.018
Guy wasn't calling
from a local number or cell.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:30.057
He was calling from a calling card.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:31.608
Yes, hello.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.862
I'm calling because
we had a situation here

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:39.116
where a prank phone call
led to a sexual assault,

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:41.653
Actually a rape, but...

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:45.369
we found that the calling card
used to make the call

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.909
was purchased in your jurisdiction.

01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:49.676
Prank phone call
that turned into a rape.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.755
Yeah, I remember.
It was at a fast-food joint, right?

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:53.755
<i>That's right.</i>

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:57.464
<i>Caller said he was a cop
made 'em strip-search a girl.</i>

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:59.173
- <i>It</i> was at a Wendy's.
- That's right.

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:01.054
No, not a Wendy's, no.

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:04.638
We've identified the place
where the calling card was sold from.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.098
<i>Its in your district,
and this just happened last night.</i>

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:09.661
Here. It was at a Wendy's.
You're calling from Boston, right?

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.522
<i>Boston? No.</i>

01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:11.807
Was right here in Ohio.

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:14.978
<i>"Manager strip-searched teen customer,</i>

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:17.397
Wendy's, Essex County,
Massachusetts."

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.190
Two weeks ago.

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:25.117
This happened more than once?
You gotta be shitting me.

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:49.729
- See if they got security.
- Yeah, right there.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:51.771
So he paid cash.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:55.902
And he bought one of those prepaid cellphones,
so that's why you're having trouble with that.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.358
<i>But there is good news.
We got him on video.</i>

01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.817
<i>Oh, that's great.</i>

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:02.824
<i>You should see some
of the stuff we got on video.</i>

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:04.656
<i>Well, I mean, he could be anybody</i>

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.445
<i>"who's white, 5'11" and in their 30s.</i>

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:10.833
<i>But the footage had a big window,
and I could see his car.</i>

01:21:10.991 --> 01:21:12.413
<i>You got a license plate?</i>

01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:14.749
<i>No, but there was a parking sticker</i>

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:16.630
<i>from this office park
right down the road.</i>

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.749
You won't believe
what this guy does for a living.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:19.713
Hello, ma'am.
We're calling today

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.915
with an important offer
about your banking security.

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:23.754
Well, you should know
that our company

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:25.514
specializes in credit protection

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:29.393
for people like you who want
to monitor their credit scores.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:31.724
Well, ma'am, I can make it
happen right away

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.515
before someone uses
your name to gain credit.

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:40.270
Can you hold on a sec?

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:45.818
I wanted to speak with you
about a civil suit against Sandra Fromme.

01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:48.453
I don't think that's the route to take.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:51.081
These calls were happening
all over the country,

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.662
even in your particular chain.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:53.997
Oh, no. I'm... Thank you.

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:55.786
You could sue Sandra, you know,

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:57.751
this unemployed,
former fast-food worker,

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:01.543
or you... you could bring a suit

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:03.676
against the national corporation.

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:07.340
They weren't issuing specific enough
warnings on hoaxes.

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:13.312
So you and Van
are no longer together?

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:16.314
No, I haven't talked to him
since that night,

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:18.726
and I don't want to ever,

01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:21.270
because of what...

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.564
because of what he did.

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:27.860
But do you feel any responsibility
for what you did?

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:30.408
Of course I do.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:33.575
<i>I</i> feel...

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:36.914
I feel that it was terrible
what happened to Becky,

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:38.374
but I...

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:43.129
I was doing what I thought
was the right thing.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:46.296
I... I did what I think
anybody would do,

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.635
what you would do
in that circumstance.

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.049
Take a girl's clothes away

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:52.309
because someone
told you to on the phone?

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.971
Someone who said
they were the police.

01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:59.313
Did you know that the police station
was only a half-mile away?

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:04.447
Well, what he said was
that he was investigating from her house.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.858
And I asked him...

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:09.322
You know, "When are you coming?"
I asked many times.

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:13.786
And yet he never came,
and that didn't make you suspicious?

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:16.075
Yeah, well...

01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:20.538
He had an answer every time
that I asked a question.

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:23.799
And everything about it
was strange to me,

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:27.052
but he... I was very, very stressed,

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:29.305
and we were very busy,

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:34.811
and when I asked him a question,
he always had an answer.

01:23:34.968 --> 01:23:37.437
Were you brainwashed?

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:40.558
Brainwashed? Well, I mean,

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:42.518
I felt very foolish.

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.194
I can say that.

01:23:44.978 --> 01:23:46.855
But I don't know would I say brainwashed.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.774
Maybe, a little bit.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:50.443
So you were a victim, too.

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:52.486
I was absolutely a victim.

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:54.826
Not maybe like Becky was a victim,

01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:59.915
but that was a very evil prank
that was played,

01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:02.580
and I didn't want to do those things.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.919
I felt he took advantage of me.

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:07.210
I did what I was told to do.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:10.387
Becky told you
that she didn't want you to do it.

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:13.720
It wasn't a prank to her.
She begged you to stop.

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:17.390
It never occurred to you to think twice?

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:18.805
Well, she didn't...

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:20.097
No, I don't...

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:21.766
That's not how I recall.

01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:24.526
She agreed to the search.

01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:30.984
And she agreed to everything
that she... Yeah.

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:35.029
Well, it seems like she's crying
and begging on the tape.

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:39.496
What about when you came in
and Van still had her uncovered?

01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:41.376
No, she had her apron.

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:43.378
She always had the apron on.

01:24:43.537 --> 01:24:45.585
She was covered by the apron.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:47.253
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.010
On the tape,
you can clearly see her naked...

01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:52.671
- No.
- One moment when you walk in.

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:56.266
Can we... Can we play that tape?

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:04.441
What were you...
What were you thinking then?

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.853
Sandra, you won't answer
those kinds of questions.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:08.380
- Okay.
- We aren't answering that.

01:25:08.478 --> 01:25:09.604
We won't answer that.

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.364
She can't answer
that question for me?

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:12.649
No.

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:49.649
You from the area?

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:52.485
No, not originally.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:55.572
Oh, really? Where are you from?

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:58.078
New Orleans.

01:25:58.236 --> 01:26:01.410
It's lovely down there

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.080
if-if you don't mind the heat, isn't it?

01:26:05.452 --> 01:26:07.500
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:10.507
Well, yeah, I had a cousin
who went there,

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:13.886
and the humidity,
I think, is very high.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.763
Yeah.
