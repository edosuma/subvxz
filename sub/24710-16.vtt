was found buried

I jumped up and sat on my own testicle.

15:11.952 --> 15:15.831
Friday afternoon, Richie Waughan
comes to me to...

15:15.915 --> 15:17.666
to transport a dumpster off-site.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.378
If you knew Richie, you wouldn't ask
why you're doing something,

15:21.503 --> 15:24.506
even if you weren't working for him,
and I'm his employee.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.594
So, I load the dumpster,
I drive to the alley,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.513
and I roll it out
next to the other dumpsters.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.058
-Never once looked inside?
-Not if you know Richie.

15:34.224 --> 15:37.728
And this was like some magic process,
the credit card gets to your pocket.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.441
Before I drive off-site, Richie hands me
that credit card,

15:42.733 --> 15:45.819
to make one big-ticket purchase,
then tear the card up.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.863
And nothing's smellin' fishy to you?

15:48.197 --> 15:49.907
Well, whatever happened,
I know I didn't do it.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.951
So you bought the stereo on Saturday?

15:52.993 --> 15:56.205
Then I got greedy.
I didn't tear the credit card up,

15:56.288 --> 15:57.790
and went back for the TV today.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.126
Lookin' back now,
that's where I messed up,

16:01.377 --> 16:02.962
trying to double-dip with the TV.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.133
Right?

16:08.884 --> 16:11.887
-Get in the cage.
-Just so long as you know I...

16:11.971 --> 16:14.306
-I didn't kill this guy.
-Get in the cage and shut up.

16:15.307 --> 16:19.728
Hey, hey. hey. hey. I... I imagine
you want to talk to Richie next.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.898
This time of day he's on-site.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.736
He's lucky he's as stupid as he is

16:27.820 --> 16:30.197
or he'd realize
how good his boss framed him.

16:38.914 --> 16:42.001
Bartender at the Silver Dollar said
Bennie's called Rooster,

16:42.084 --> 16:43.961
said he's on a bus junket
to Atlantic City.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.045
What's going on?

16:45.129 --> 16:47.131
What's the guy's act used the D.O.A.'s
credit card?

16:47.256 --> 16:49.466
He's a mutt, but you can probably
like his boss.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.719
Does day work at a construction site,
this Ted.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.514
Told us his boss had him put a dumpster
onto his truck and unload it in an alley

16:55.639 --> 16:56.640
like ten blocks away.

16:56.932 --> 17:00.602
His boss paid him for the errand by, uh,
letting him use a boosted credit card

17:00.686 --> 17:01.687
one time only.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.606
Do you buy he didn't know it was
the D.O.A.'s credit card he was using?

17:04.732 --> 17:07.860
Yeah. I found that credible,
and also him not looking in the dumpster.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.821
Yeah, you find it credible pretty much
anything this Ted overlooked.

17:10.946 --> 17:11.989
Go straight at his boss.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.575
The boss definitely points you to this guy
off the credit card.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.994
He definitely set him up for the patsy.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.580
Has he got brains enough
to help us with a wire?

17:20.039 --> 17:22.624
-Get his boss on tape?
-You'd really want to give him

17:22.708 --> 17:24.418
a thorough prep, this Ted.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.463
Contact Taru, have him here
first thing in the morning.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.589
Wire the guy up.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.216
JILL: Okay, I'm keep trying to contact
the, uh, D.O.A.'s parents.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.052
-Yeah. Where do they live?
-Dayton.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.636
I'll pick up the building owner
in the morning,

17:34.720 --> 17:36.388
if he didn't make his fortune
on the slots.

17:36.513 --> 17:37.514
Sounds like a front.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.017
Yeah, you don't meet that many legit guys
named Rooster.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.579
He didn't really want to talk to me, Andy.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.540
-And how did you approach that?
-How did I approach it?

18:04.083 --> 18:07.294
-His initial reluctance.
-I asked him how he was doing.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.629
He said he was okay.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.798
He didn't really want to go into it more.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.509
-So his initial reluctance continued?
-Right.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.470
-And you left it there?
-Yeah. That's where I left it.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.305
Nothing on this situation with the girl?

18:27.898 --> 18:30.651
You, uh, want to run this down for Ted,
with me and James, Andy?

18:30.734 --> 18:31.944
Let him know about the wire?

18:33.946 --> 18:34.988
No.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.600
Hi, Nadine.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.645
-Hi.
-Could we talk a little?

19:27.499 --> 19:30.502
-You want a beer?
-No. Thanks.

19:32.838 --> 19:36.300
I'm sure about it, Danny.
I took the home test three times.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.387
(SIGHS) It's just...
You said it couldn't happen.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.389
I told you what my doctor told me.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.934
I have scar tissue from an infection
when I was seven years old,

19:46.185 --> 19:47.686
and I couldn't conceive a child.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.439
I'm not questioning your honesty, Nadine.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.525
I know you think I tricked you into this.
I know that's what you're thinking.

19:53.942 --> 19:57.196
I'm not. I'm trying to understand
what's going on,

19:57.321 --> 19:58.697
so we can decide what to do.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.490
We don't have to decide anything.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.701
I was not trying
to involve you or trap you,

20:02.784 --> 20:04.912
so you can just stop worrying, okay?

20:11.752 --> 20:14.463
All that happened at the station house,
I was a minute getting my head around

20:14.588 --> 20:15.672
what you told me.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.967
I understand that you took that
for reservation on my part

20:19.259 --> 20:22.179
or me thinking that you were scheming.
But that wasn't it.

20:22.804 --> 20:23.805
It wasn't?

20:23.972 --> 20:26.099
I don't think
you tried to trap me, Nadine.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.145
I'm a good judge of character,
and I don't believe you'd do that.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.233
Anyone thinks we're dealing the cards
what happens to us,

20:34.566 --> 20:35.901
hasn't been around too much.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.738
This is what happened.

I want to do the right thing.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.327
What do you mean, Danny?

I'll always meet my responsibilities
to you and the baby,

20:50.457 --> 20:51.792

20:55.671 --> 20:57.297
As far as what develops between us...

20:59.508 --> 21:01.176
I'd as soon that takes its own course.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.513
Yeah. I think that makes sense.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.765
Thanks, Danny.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.270
I apologize for flying off the handle.

-Locker room's barricaded.
-Yeah. They're wiring that mope up.

I got a personal situation.
I'm involved with a girl.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.197

You know...

22:13.623 --> 22:16.418
Pregnant. I'm convinced it's mine,
one thing,

22:17.711 --> 22:19.254
and I believed it was accidental.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.715
(CLEARS THROAT) She has a condition.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.300
The doctors
didn't think this could happen.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.845
-Why you didn't take precautions.
-Yeah, exactly.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.724
Some medical situation,
I didn't go into the details.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.977
And, um, she wants to keep the baby?

22:34.770 --> 22:35.771
Definitely.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.274
How... how do you feel about it?

22:39.858 --> 22:42.319
I wouldn't bring a child in the world,
I wasn't responsible for.

22:43.403 --> 22:44.780
Do you think you could fall
in love with her?

22:46.948 --> 22:48.241
Nadine's a really nice girl.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.120
Being truthful, we don't really know
each other that well.

22:57.459 --> 23:00.253
For what it's worth,
Andy's always helped me

23:00.337 --> 23:01.630
a lot easier than himself.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.804
-Thanks Diane, for talking to me.
-I hope it works out.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.139
I'm... I'm gonna get a yogurt.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.352
Andy, you want a yogurt?

23:15.602 --> 23:17.854
You think I've been occupied
by some strange spirit?

23:23.610 --> 23:24.611
How's it going?

23:26.029 --> 23:27.030
Good.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.117
Me and her, we got a lot of things
ironed out last night.

23:30.617 --> 23:31.743
You and Nadine.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.587
As far as bein' pregnant, she is.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.383
That was a given,
and she admitted to entrapping you?

23:47.300 --> 23:50.512
She didn't entrap me, Andy.
She didn't think she could get pregnant.

23:52.431 --> 23:57.060
She have, like, a church dispensation
she could do that without consequence?

23:57.561 --> 24:01.398
They told her she couldn't have a baby,
her doctors. She went on their word.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.360
You were who was present.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.739
You're better positioned than me
if she's shooting you through the grease.

24:11.074 --> 24:13.618
Yeah. I don't think she's shooting me
through the grease.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.413
Fine, good, leave it at that.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.131

24:26.256 --> 24:27.716

proper responsibility.

given the givens how she lays them out,

24:34.639 --> 24:38.101
-assuming the assumptions.
-Yes, Andy, correct.

given the givens.

with my son.

so I don't have to hit this moron.

may be closed.

-What I did is weighing on my mind.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.495
What I had you do is weighing on you?

26:21.538 --> 26:24.791
What you had me do, right?
I'm worried about it, okay?

26:25.333 --> 26:29.129
The name on the credit card you gave me
is the same name as the dead guy

26:29.421 --> 26:31.590

Richie.

is coincidence.

for the credit card?

to our site.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.914

or punch you in the face.

okay? That's important.

31:03.820 --> 31:07.657
Oh. Has Gary been misusing
his credit card? (CHUCKLES)

31:08.533 --> 31:09.617
Hmm.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.871
Look, to tell you the truth,
as far as knowing anything about Gary,

31:13.705 --> 31:15.206
you just put me out of my depth.

31:15.790 --> 31:20.795
I'm, uh... what do you call it?
I'm more an absentee landlord type.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.506
You're so absentee,
you don't know who lives there?

31:24.340 --> 31:26.634
That building ain't no
20-story high-rise, Rooster.

31:26.801 --> 31:28.845
Yeah, but I'm totally absentee.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.639
-Did you know the super in your building?
-No.

31:31.931 --> 31:34.559
-He's Ethiopian.
-Well, there I'm way out of my depth.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.938
(CLEARS THROAT) Rooster, it's always
possible that you're an eccentric,

31:39.022 --> 31:42.317
Howard Hughes type real estate mogul,
dressing below his station.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.736
But you being out of your depth
so consistently,

31:45.069 --> 31:47.530
my money's on you fronting
for that building's real owner.

31:47.697 --> 31:51.784
What is this about, taxes?
Zoning or some type delinquency?

31:52.327 --> 31:54.412
Tell us who really owns that building,
Rooster,

31:54.495 --> 31:57.624
or what it's gonna be about
is you getting charged with felony fraud.

31:59.542 --> 32:00.585
My son-in-law.

32:01.711 --> 32:05.465
You see, he's got liability issues
on another dwellings he's involved with.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.092
So you let him put your name
on the ownership papers.

32:08.176 --> 32:09.761
DANNY: We got no problem with that,
Rooster.

32:10.136 --> 32:13.556
We're not looking to give
your son-in-law or you any IRS problems.

32:14.182 --> 32:17.685
It's just to ask him for background
on this shopaholic tenant?

32:17.810 --> 32:19.479
That's the sum and substance of it.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.860
Richie Vaughan is my son-in-law.

32:25.985 --> 32:28.696
-JILL: Attaboy, Rooster.
-Yeah. Cock-a-doodle-doo.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.075
-Where are we gonna reach Richie?
-Building site he's contracted on.

32:32.241 --> 32:33.409
I'll write it down.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.912
And the way
he described the aggravation,

32:36.120 --> 32:39.040
before I'd actually own that building,
I'd have my head examined.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.834
Richie said one of the tenants found out
he was the actual owner.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.795
The guy's a 24/7 complainer.

32:46.881 --> 32:47.966
Richie'd like to kill him.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.693
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-Ted better hope Andy had a good BM.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.989
I think Andy beats his balls off
regardless.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.452
It's bad enough you screwed up
with Richie, Ted.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.537
Where the hell you been?

33:19.664 --> 33:22.291
I walked three blocks from the site,
down the subway,

33:22.792 --> 33:25.670
jumped back on the platform just before
the doors closed..

33:25.753 --> 33:28.047
-All right. We got bigger problems.
-Up the street again,

33:28.172 --> 33:31.592
circled the block, down the train,
and get on.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.178
Okay. You took good precautions.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.306
I got cited for hopping a turnstile.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.393
Can you make that disappear?

33:41.853 --> 33:44.313
-JAMES: Oh, boy.
-Welcome back, numb-nut.

33:45.064 --> 33:47.650
-Sorry, it didn't work out.
-Aw, no hard feelings.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.653
-Is he miffed at my problems with Richie?
-ANDY: What?

33:50.987 --> 33:52.739
Well... Richie.
I was asking if you was miffed.

33:52.905 --> 33:56.242
Miffed? Am I miffed?
No. No, I'm not miffed.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.541
How do we go after him now?

34:03.916 --> 34:05.793
-What's plan "B"?
-Ted.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.463
Go away.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.884
You are forcin' the transmitter
into my 'tain't.

34:13.718 --> 34:14.761
Come on.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.345
So are we going to remove
the transmitter now?

34:16.471 --> 34:17.805
Yeah, yeah. Let's hurry.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.400
-That's bad.
-The head-patting.

34:30.818 --> 34:32.320
How'd the guy do with the wire?

34:33.362 --> 34:34.489
Very poorly.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.949
-Yeah, huh?
-TED: Oh, my god!

34:39.327 --> 34:41.996
It turns out this Vaughan
was the D.O.A.'s landlord.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.791
We were just over there.
Three of the other tenants said the D.O.A.

34:44.874 --> 34:46.834
was a ball-breaker
over building maintenance.

34:46.959 --> 34:49.295
The D.O.A. tracked down Vaughan
was the real owner,

34:49.587 --> 34:51.839
tried to organize a tenants' vigil
outside his house.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.841
TED: Mary, Mother of God!

35:02.767 --> 35:05.186
You tell him to yank fast, he ignores you.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.979
I'm feeling waves of nausea.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.564
Strap him back up.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.256
-That him?
-Yeah.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.091
I'm that idiot's brother.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.468
I don't care who you are.
You'd better take a big step back, pal.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.804
You're done givin' orders to anybody
in my family.

35:40.054 --> 35:43.516
And I think we're gonna talk about
what we need to talk about in private.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.226
Unless you wanna do it
in front of your men.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.479
Me. You got me now.

35:51.899 --> 35:52.984
Come on.

36:01.367 --> 36:04.537
-All right. What the hell's going on here?
-You got balls, Richie.

36:04.912 --> 36:07.915
Whackin' a guy and then making my brother
help dispose the body.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.500
-Keep it down.
-The hell if I will.

36:09.625 --> 36:12.503
You wanna talk? We'll talk.
Just keep it down.

36:12.587 --> 36:16.215
What we need to talk about is you putting
my brother in that kind of a jackpot.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.093
And then figuring it's only worth
a 100 dollar boom box.

36:19.218 --> 36:20.803
I gave him a credit card to use.

36:21.262 --> 36:24.223
He's not smart enough to use it
for a bigger score, that's his problem.

36:24.307 --> 36:27.101
"Keep the amount within reason,"
was your exact words, Richie.

36:27.393 --> 36:30.354
And my brother's mistaking the electronic
item I purchased...

36:30.646 --> 36:34.233
Him staying mute will cost you
10,000 cash today.

36:34.442 --> 36:35.484
You're out of your mind.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.739
If you think it's only you in this room
that ever took another man's life,

36:39.989 --> 36:40.990
you're mistaken.

36:45.828 --> 36:48.623
-Three grand.
-ANDY: <i>7,500.</i>

36:48.956 --> 36:50.041
Five.

36:50.333 --> 36:54.212
6,500 would be exactly down the middle
between your opening offers...

36:54.670 --> 36:56.130
Five grand, cash. Today.

36:56.255 --> 37:00.843
Now let's square stories in case the cops
start interviewing friends or coworkers.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.096
Did this guy that you whacked
have any contact with Ted?

37:04.513 --> 37:07.808
-Ted don't know him.
-Who the hell was he to you, anyway?

37:08.017 --> 37:10.645
Just some guy with a big mouth
who underestimated me,

37:10.937 --> 37:14.482
something which you should keep in mind
you ever decide to come back for more.

37:16.150 --> 37:18.277
I think you got a third party
to worry about.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.155
I'm lost for the moment.

37:21.781 --> 37:24.450
"Some bigmouth underestimated me."

37:25.034 --> 37:28.329
(SNIFFS) He don't have the balls
to do murder himself.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.623
Believe me, I did that murder, pal.

37:31.624 --> 37:34.877
He was a pain in the balls tenant
that I got sick of hearing complain.

37:35.544 --> 37:38.381
You come back for more shakedown money,
I'll do the same to you.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.300
-Where's the 5,000?
-My bank is down on fourth.

37:41.842 --> 37:45.263
Let's go. I can quake in my boots walking.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.149
I hated to have to bring him in
on this, Richie.

37:57.233 --> 38:00.027
-Police. Get your hands up.
-You're a collar, asshole.

38:00.152 --> 38:03.322
You're a collar, Richie.
You're laid, blown, and parlayed.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.907
I'm gonna kill you. I swear to god.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.367
No matter what it takes,
you're a dead man.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.744
Still don't go trying to make
a plea bargain now.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.332
Watch out, please.

38:27.054 --> 38:30.057
I'm a friend of detective Sorenson's.
Nadine Dimarco.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.352
-Hey.
-Hi.

38:34.895 --> 38:37.481
-John, Nadine Dimarco.
-We just met, yes.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.193
It's all right. What's the matter?

38:44.947 --> 38:46.282
I'm not anymore.

38:50.119 --> 38:53.164
-Okay, Nadine.
-The little pregnant I was, I'm not.

38:53.456 --> 38:56.751
-It's all right.
-I was, though. I just went to the doctor.

38:57.126 --> 39:00.004
-(SOBS) I wasn't tricking you.
-Shh.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.214
-I lost the baby.
-Shh.

39:02.506 --> 39:03.799
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

39:05.843 --> 39:07.219
The eagle has landed.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.893
Richie Vaughan is in custody,
thanks to the, uh, fake brother work,

39:14.352 --> 39:16.145
of me and Detective Sipowicz.

39:17.229 --> 39:19.899
-Come on.
-GREG: Let's take off your transmitter.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.819
-Locked?
-Yeah.

39:24.570 --> 39:25.780
Come on. Let's go downstairs.

39:29.283 --> 39:30.868
Why don't we go somewhere's and talk?

39:31.744 --> 39:34.789
I couldn't.
That's why I wanted to come here.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.250
This was all too strange anyway.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.878
Right, Danny? I mean... (SOBS)

39:41.087 --> 39:43.547
I wasn't even supposed
to be able to get pregnant.

39:44.298 --> 39:48.219
And we pretty much just liked
each other at a bar.

39:50.554 --> 39:53.265
It would've been too much of a miracle.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.193
I'm calling you.

40:05.277 --> 40:08.447
Could you wait... let me call you?

40:10.825 --> 40:11.909
Please?

40:33.556 --> 40:35.724
She's not in that situation.
No more Nadine.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.228
I saw she was upset.

40:40.938 --> 40:43.607
I guess, if that happens,
it's for the best.

40:44.483 --> 40:45.484
Guess so.

40:46.318 --> 40:47.361
Not us necessarily.

40:48.571 --> 40:49.822
For her body.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.117
We were gonna have it.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.203
I'd never not be a parent, you know?

40:57.746 --> 40:58.831
Me neither.

41:17.641 --> 41:18.809
Andy.

41:23.230 --> 41:24.482
That's over, with Nadine.

41:26.775 --> 41:27.985
She's not pregnant no more.

41:29.111 --> 41:31.280
She says she's gonna call me,
once she's feeling better.

41:32.156 --> 41:37.453
Huh, the old days they'd say,
"Don't tell nobody for three months."

41:37.786 --> 41:39.038
Till the baby's more likely.

41:39.955 --> 41:42.208
My wife told me that with our little guy.

41:42.917 --> 41:45.794
Keep your mouth shut
for the first 90 days of the pregnancy.

41:46.879 --> 41:49.715
Twenty-four hours,
I'd sworn the whole squad to secrecy.

41:53.177 --> 41:56.722
You know... I'm half a head case, Andy.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.433
You ever see my potholder collection?

42:00.392 --> 42:01.852
I get confused sometimes.

42:02.478 --> 42:05.856
Look, I don't pretend knowin' everything
about everything, especially about women.

42:06.315 --> 42:09.109
You intended meeting your responsibilities
with this girl.

42:09.902 --> 42:12.112
I care for my sisters as best I can.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.449
You been doing that a long time.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.370
I get tired not knowin' what I'm doin'.

42:21.038 --> 42:24.333
Does your, uh,
aunt and uncle counsel you at all?

42:25.334 --> 42:26.877
Grateful as I am they raised us,

42:27.920 --> 42:31.257
my aunt and uncle withheld information
about my family situation, Andy.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.886
My mother was alive
13 years longer than I thought.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.014
I wouldn't trust my aunt and uncle
to help me cross the street.

42:40.683 --> 42:43.644
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

42:44.395 --> 42:46.647
I feel bad for this Nadine,
I'll tell you that much.

42:47.815 --> 42:48.857
She'll be okay.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.110
You know that?

don't mean the other person's happy.

-Hey.

How are things going, Danny?

43:05.791 --> 43:09.003
All right. You know,
that situation's resolved.

-Good night.
-Yeah. Good night.

Good night, Diane.

43:23.517 --> 43:25.269
She don't need to be walked to her car.

43:26.937 --> 43:28.522
No. She can probably make it.

43:32.610 --> 43:35.654
Anyways... Thanks a lot, Andy.

43:36.822 --> 43:37.823
Sure.
