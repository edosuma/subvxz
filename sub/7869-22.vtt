(marching band playing)

(song ends)

00:10.111 --> 00:11.477
Well done, the band.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.811
We're all bursting with pride

00:12.813 --> 00:16.081
after our girls' basketball team
beat Shelbyville

00:16.083 --> 00:18.317
two-nothing in triple overtime!

00:18.319 --> 00:20.386
Now let's make some noise.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.520
Using our...

00:21.522 --> 00:22.654
(loudly):
inside voices!

00:22.656 --> 00:24.356
(quiet cheering, drumroll)

00:24.358 --> 00:29.695
Please welcome Springfield
Elementary's own Lady Pumas!

(applause)

00:35.302 --> 00:35.801
(all gasping)

00:35.803 --> 00:38.437
I'm sorry, but the team
all got food poisoning

00:38.439 --> 00:41.106
at the pre-rally
egg salad sandwich party.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.242
Luckily, as equipment manager,

00:43.244 --> 00:45.444
I... was not... invited!

00:45.446 --> 00:46.678
(whoops)

00:46.680 --> 00:47.546
No team? Oh, I guess

00:47.548 --> 00:51.383
I just have to give you all
an hour of free play.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.152

00:53.154 --> 00:55.187
Let chaos reign!

(grunting)

00:56.690 --> 00:57.623
(microphone squeals)

00:57.625 --> 00:59.458
Actually, I do have
a speech prepared.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.194
Excellent, Lisa.
Free play canceled.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.262
(all groaning)

01:03.264 --> 01:05.564
No one cancels
my free play!

01:05.566 --> 01:07.199
(grunts)

01:07.201 --> 01:08.067
Sorry, man.

01:08.069 --> 01:11.603
It's okay. Thanks for making me
part of the revolution.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.272
Edna, control your student!

01:13.274 --> 01:14.139
He's ruined more assemblies

01:14.141 --> 01:16.542
than the afternoon sun
in the west window.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.509
He's uncontrollable!

01:17.511 --> 01:19.578
Pumpkin stickers mean nothing
to him!

01:19.580 --> 01:21.146
That's crazy talk.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.314

Wee!

01:30.424 --> 01:31.423
Me bleachers

01:31.425 --> 01:33.125

01:33.127 --> 01:35.094
Abandon gym!

Mrs. Krabappel groans)

01:51.445 --> 01:54.146
(Bart laughing)

01:54.148 --> 01:54.847
Huh?

01:54.849 --> 01:57.649
You unrepentant
little twerp!

01:57.651 --> 01:58.750
(grunts)

01:58.752 --> 01:59.651
(clamoring stops)

children gasp)

02:01.455 --> 02:03.222
(gasping stops)

02:03.224 --> 02:04.356
Oh, Edna.

02:04.358 --> 02:07.459
It was an open hand.
Does that help?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.227
SKINNER:
Edna,

02:08.229 --> 02:09.862
we can tolerate mild alcoholism,

02:09.864 --> 02:11.697
leaving melted cheese
in the microwave,

02:11.699 --> 02:13.632
even selling A's
for cigarettes.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.934
But in laying a
hand on a student,

02:15.936 --> 02:17.636
you have crossed a line.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.505
Nurse, get
a slap kit.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.606
Right away, sir.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.474
In all my years of teaching,

02:22.476 --> 02:25.377
I've never raised a hand
to a student.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.279
But you learned!
You grew!

02:27.281 --> 02:30.782
No! You should never raise
your hand to a child.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.352
Just leave the crust
on their sandwiches.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.753
They'll get
the message.

02:34.755 --> 02:35.821
Rest assured,
Mrs. Simpson,

02:35.823 --> 02:39.691
that we have a zero-tolerance
policy for this sort of thing

02:39.693 --> 02:42.194
when it occurs in
front of witnesses.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.428
What's going to happen to me?

02:43.430 --> 02:46.265
Edna, you're suspended
with full pay until the hearing,

02:46.267 --> 02:49.701
which is currently scheduled
for 57 years from tomorrow.

02:49.703 --> 02:53.372
It was going to be 60,
but I moved it up because I...

02:53.374 --> 02:54.640
I like the way
you torment Skinner.

02:54.642 --> 02:59.578
Oh. So I-I still get my check,
but I get to stay at home?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.513
I'm afraid
it's not quite that simple.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.615
Uh, Seymour, who's
running this meeting?

03:03.617 --> 03:04.883
(loud whisper):
I thought I was.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.853
Edna, until the state
disciplinary committee rules

03:07.855 --> 03:10.556
on your case,
every workday you'll report

03:10.558 --> 03:13.258
to a school board
holding facility--

03:13.260 --> 03:15.427
an educational limbo,
as it were,

03:15.429 --> 03:18.864
where you are
the unbaptized dead baby.

03:18.866 --> 03:19.398
(groans)

03:19.400 --> 03:22.334
They never seem
to like that analogy.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.236
(dog barking)

03:24.238 --> 03:25.837
This is the Rubber Room,

03:25.839 --> 03:27.272
where accused
teachers are held

03:27.274 --> 03:29.841
until the school board
decides what to do with them.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.945
You show up here every day,
7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.

03:32.947 --> 03:35.914
Shoes remain on, cell
phones remain off.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.684
No Wi-Fi, and you may not
refer to this experience

03:38.686 --> 03:40.852
as either Kafkaesque
or Orwellian.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.288
I have to come here
every day?!

03:43.290 --> 03:44.790
Or you could quit.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.592
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

03:46.594 --> 03:49.428
The only thing I'd like more is
if I could quit.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.729
Well, I'm not quitting.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.599
I'm staying here
till you give me my job back.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.634
So, what do you
do for fun here?

03:55.636 --> 03:57.502
You'll find ways
to pass the time.

03:57.504 --> 04:00.439
Me, I watch that crack
in the ceiling.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.976
Hey, hey, find
your own crack!

04:03.978 --> 04:04.743
Now before I leave,

04:04.745 --> 04:08.013
let me turn on this
malfunctioning air conditioner.

04:08.015 --> 04:08.981
(whirring)

04:08.983 --> 04:10.649
Is that ice?

04:10.651 --> 04:13.385
Uh, no, no,
they're spider eggs.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.254
(grunts)

04:15.256 --> 04:16.521
He's a science teacher.

04:16.523 --> 04:19.391
He'll know what to do.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.599
BART (whispering loudly):
Psst! Mrs. K!

04:27.601 --> 04:28.467
Down here!

04:28.469 --> 04:31.036
Haven't you caused
enough trouble?

04:31.038 --> 04:33.639
You shouldn't suffer
for my bad deed.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.674
It should just go
unpunished forever.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.043
Fine, half-assed
apology accepted.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.478
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:39.480 --> 04:42.781
I have a lot
of very important things to do.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.450
(snoring)

04:45.452 --> 04:46.918
(munching)

04:46.920 --> 04:48.887
Pah!

04:48.889 --> 04:51.356
(munching)

04:51.358 --> 04:53.025
What else do you want
to talk about?

04:53.027 --> 04:54.393
Meet me in the bathroom.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.728
(loud footsteps)

04:58.332 --> 05:00.565
Check this out--
a dead possum.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.566
(hissing)

05:01.568 --> 05:02.701
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

05:02.703 --> 05:04.336
(loud footsteps)

05:05.339 --> 05:06.938
Okay, Bart,
what's going on?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.074
I'm a teacher in a
bathroom with a student.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.010
That's why most of these people
are here in the first place.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.413
Mrs. K., I'm here to spring you.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.380
Well, that's kind of you,

05:15.382 --> 05:18.617
especially after I nearly
choked the life out of you.

05:18.619 --> 05:19.451
You didn't do that.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.687
No, but that's what
I told everyone I did

05:21.689 --> 05:24.056
to earn the respect
of the gangs.

05:26.393 --> 05:29.995
But I can't just wander out of
here whenever I feel like it.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.630
Who says you're leaving?

05:31.632 --> 05:32.731
(Mrs. Krabappel gasps)

05:32.733 --> 05:34.766
You made a dummy of me?

05:34.768 --> 05:37.502
Mm, I use it to
workshop my pranks.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.974
(laughing)

05:42.976 --> 05:44.509
Now follow me!

05:44.511 --> 05:47.946
(grunting)

05:47.948 --> 05:50.482
Oh, I don't know about this.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.016
I can't believe

05:51.018 --> 05:53.685
a middle-aged woman is scared
of a three-story drop.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.755
I'll show you who's middle-aged!

05:56.757 --> 05:59.324
(whimpering)

06:00.027 --> 06:01.560
(groaning)

06:01.562 --> 06:03.028
Hmm?

06:03.030 --> 06:03.695
Oh, great!

06:03.697 --> 06:06.598
The one day
I put cream cheese on my bagel!

06:06.600 --> 06:08.867
(metal creaking, yelling)

06:12.573 --> 06:13.538
(screaming)

06:13.540 --> 06:16.641
(chuckling)
Did a volcano
erupt in Candyland?

06:16.643 --> 06:19.811
'Cause I just caught
me a flying red hot!

06:19.813 --> 06:22.347
Ha! Ah...

06:25.119 --> 06:26.151
You know, I don't believe

06:26.153 --> 06:28.620
we've ever been formally
introduced. Anyhoo,

06:28.622 --> 06:30.956
so I don't commit the
deadliest of sins--

06:30.958 --> 06:32.991
omission--
here's my card.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.459
Oh.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.827
Edna Krabappel.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.729
Good luck finding
a rhyme for that.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.665
Okay, Ms. Krabappel,
what made you topple?

06:40.667 --> 06:43.068
Oh, your card doesn't lie.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.870
Well, I'm a truthful
kind of guy.

06:44.872 --> 06:48.407
And I like
how it's printed in orange.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.541
Hmm.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.477
Uh, so, uh, we were talking
about why you decided

06:52.479 --> 06:53.879
to drop in
to the Flanders Arms.

06:53.881 --> 06:58.417
For some reason, I was following
the advice of one Bart Simpson.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.119
Bart Simpson? Why, he lives
right next door to me!

07:01.121 --> 07:01.953
Yeah, when they made him,

07:01.955 --> 07:04.489
they did not skimp on
the puppy dog tails.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.191
And what about that father?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.492
Homer?

07:07.494 --> 07:08.794
(chuckles)

07:08.796 --> 07:10.996
Yeah, he's the peanut
in your popcorn.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.832
Lots of fun... I guess.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.568
So, what say
we have lunch?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.069
You know, I wouldn't mind

07:18.071 --> 07:19.070
Homer lying naked
in his hammock,

07:19.072 --> 07:22.541
but does he have to string it up
higher than the fence line?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.509
I'll bet your wife
doesn't like it.

07:24.511 --> 07:24.943
Ah, I'm afraid

07:24.945 --> 07:27.612
my Maudie's putting plastic
on the clouds now.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.815
Oh, you poor man.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.016
Besides my kids, the only thing

07:31.018 --> 07:33.185
in my life is my business,
The Leftorium.

07:33.187 --> 07:34.186
We've been the anchor store

07:34.188 --> 07:37.055
in the sad mall
for the last ten years.

07:37.057 --> 07:37.722
Oh.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.191
And you're a former Mrs.,

07:39.193 --> 07:41.927
so, uh, where's
your husband buried?

07:41.929 --> 07:42.961
Probably between
the hooters

07:42.963 --> 07:45.096
of a coat check girl
in Shelbyville. Ha!

07:45.098 --> 07:48.200
(chuckling):
Oh, boy, that laugh
is infectious.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.202
Ha!<i> Ha!</i>

07:50.204 --> 07:51.603
That's fun.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.938
Thank you for
lunch, Ned.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.174
Well, thank<i> you</i> for taking me
to that Pinkberry place.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.108
It's a lot less racy

07:57.110 --> 07:59.244
than its name
would lead you to believe.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.179
Crossing it off
my do-not-go list.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.113
Mm-hmm.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.717
Well, sir, I guess
I better refenestrate ya.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.953
(humming)

08:08.689 --> 08:09.588
(clears his throat)

08:09.590 --> 08:11.690
Any chance
I could see you again?

08:11.692 --> 08:15.026
You know, I am a fallen woman.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.695
(chuckles)
Whoa, slow down.

08:16.697 --> 08:20.098
I never go to second
entendre on the first date.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.701
(both laughing)

08:22.703 --> 08:23.735
Oh, ho.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.804
(loud knocking)

08:25.806 --> 08:28.206
You've been in there
for three hours!

08:28.208 --> 08:30.675
What are you doing,
taking a bath?!

09:00.607 --> 09:02.173
Now I can just fire you.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.341
Where will I go?

09:03.343 --> 09:04.175
I'll rehire you,

09:04.177 --> 09:08.046
but you will have to work
weekends as a prison guard.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.681
Well, I would get a chance

09:09.683 --> 09:11.917
to see lots
of my former students.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.318
You've got a deal.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.152
MRS. KRABAPPEL:
<i>Mmm!</i>

09:14.154 --> 09:17.756
Getting sprung really made me
feel like celebrating.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.592
Let's see what you're hiding
under this sweater.

09:20.594 --> 09:24.596
Huh. Well, maybe
I should lose a layer.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.865
(laughing)

09:27.901 --> 09:28.700
(sighs)

09:28.702 --> 09:30.835
Edna, you're a very
beautiful woman,

09:30.837 --> 09:33.071
but I'm a little,
uh, you know...

09:33.073 --> 09:36.341
uncomfortable with
premarital sex.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.776
Oh, come on, Ned.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.044
We've both been
married before.

09:39.046 --> 09:42.180
Those two boys of yours
weren't delivered by stork.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.348
Oh, yes, they were.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.183
We deliberately
chose a Dr. Stork

09:45.185 --> 09:46.985
so we could say
it without lying.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.754
But I think if we
hold off for a while,

09:49.756 --> 09:51.222
you'll find I'm
well worth the wait.

09:51.224 --> 09:55.327
Like a mild cheddar, I get tangy
when I'm sitting on the shelf.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.929
Okay, I'll try it your way.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.600
But can I at least nibble
on the cheese? Mmm.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.867
(both moaning)

10:02.869 --> 10:03.635
(laughs)

10:03.637 --> 10:06.271
Well, a little nibble
won't hurt your appetite.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.207
(laughs)

10:11.078 --> 10:14.779
♪ ♪

10:16.817 --> 10:19.618
You have the energy
for one more?

10:19.620 --> 10:20.352
Absolutely.

10:20.354 --> 10:25.123
This is the best DVD about
cheese-making I've ever seen.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.358
Oh, great.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.828
KEN BURNS:
<i>Episode 17: Muenster.</i>

10:29.830 --> 10:30.662
Oh, what the heck?

10:30.664 --> 10:32.397
I know it's impolite
to make a move

10:32.399 --> 10:35.233
till episode 25 of a
Ken Burns documentary,

10:35.235 --> 10:38.937
but you're
that special.

10:38.939 --> 10:39.771
Ned!

10:39.773 --> 10:42.240
That's right, I'm down
to my wife-blesser.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.209
(smooching)

10:46.747 --> 10:50.682
(school bell ringing,
cheering)

10:51.385 --> 10:53.652
(cheering and shouting)

10:53.654 --> 10:56.087
It's pinot grigio time!

10:56.857 --> 10:58.356
(whirring)

10:58.358 --> 11:00.191
See you tomorrow, Teach.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.660
Don't remind me.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.928
(both chuckle)

11:03.930 --> 11:05.797
(both grumble)

11:09.736 --> 11:11.636
(tires squealing)

11:14.174 --> 11:15.173
Mrs. K.?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.409
Are you still bumping
mustaches with Ned?

11:17.411 --> 11:19.144
Yes. And the way
things are going,

11:19.146 --> 11:22.213
you're going to be
seeing me here a lot.
Even on snow days?

11:22.215 --> 11:27.085
Snow days, strike days, half-day
afternoons, and all summer long.

11:27.087 --> 11:30.055
By the way-- you forgot to bring
home your math worksheet.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.023
It's due tomorrow-- no excuses.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.925
But what if my dog eats it?

11:33.927 --> 11:34.693
(snoring)

11:34.695 --> 11:37.328
That's the dog that's always
eating your homework?

11:37.330 --> 11:39.164
Yeah. Um, he hates how learning

11:39.166 --> 11:42.801
has taken me to a place
he'll never go. See?

11:42.803 --> 11:45.270
(whines)

11:47.207 --> 11:49.874
Hang on.
Wait a minute.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.153
(annoyed grunt)

12:04.024 --> 12:04.956
(humming tune)

12:04.958 --> 12:07.792
HOMER:
Little help?
(sighs)

12:07.794 --> 12:09.194
Little help?
Little help?

12:09.196 --> 12:10.295
Uh, little
help?

12:10.297 --> 12:11.196
Flanders,
little help?

12:11.198 --> 12:15.433
Homer, could you stop throwin'
balls over my fence?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.302
Oh, absolutely,
Ned. Sorry.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.369
(snickering)

12:18.371 --> 12:20.739
Little help?

12:20.741 --> 12:23.875
(chuckling)
(sighs)

12:26.146 --> 12:28.046
(bell jingles)

12:28.048 --> 12:29.380
Don't worry, sweetie.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.183
Daddy will put Jack
back in the box.

12:32.185 --> 12:35.186
Okay, time to go
back in the...

12:35.188 --> 12:36.321
night-night...

12:36.323 --> 12:38.256
This is harder
than it looks.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.826
Don't you humiliate me
in front of my kid.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.495
I thought we had
a deal, man.

12:43.497 --> 12:45.096
(doorbell ringing)

12:45.098 --> 12:47.966
(lullaby plays)

12:48.502 --> 12:52.170
Well, if it isn't
the local school marm

12:52.172 --> 12:54.105
and his new girlfriend.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.507
(laughing)

12:55.509 --> 12:58.309
That's a burn on you, Flanders.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.944
(chuckles weakly)

12:59.946 --> 13:01.012
Pretty funny, Homer.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.046
It's not funny at all.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.883
Homer, I'd appreciate it if
you weren't so rude to Ned.

13:04.885 --> 13:08.386
Whoa. Flanders, this chick
does not get our thing.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.289
Actually,
she sort of does.

13:11.291 --> 13:11.956
(gasps)

13:11.958 --> 13:14.259
Homer, do you know
how lucky you are?

13:14.261 --> 13:18.563
Ned is a wonderful, caring man,
and a darn good neighbor.

13:18.565 --> 13:19.497
Language.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.265
Yeah, language.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.433
Sorry, Ned, but
I can't watch this guy

13:22.435 --> 13:24.135
push you around anymore.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.069
(sputtering)

13:25.071 --> 13:27.438
Marge, tell her how
I don't push Ned around.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.176
Actually, sometimes
you do push Ned around.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.076
What?!

13:32.078 --> 13:35.446
Don't do that, Homie.
It rubs off your side hair.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.849
(screams) Hey Ned, can I
borrow some hair?

13:37.851 --> 13:40.351
Which brings me to item
number two on the agenda:

13:40.353 --> 13:43.354
I understand you borrowed
a thing or two from Ned

13:43.356 --> 13:45.990
that you never returned.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.162
And I'll just take
my tumbleweed back.

13:51.932 --> 13:52.530
See, Dad?

13:52.532 --> 13:55.099
Having Krabappel next door
is nothing but trouble.

13:55.101 --> 13:58.303
Teachers should not be allowed
to live near their students.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.170
We're natural enemies,

13:59.172 --> 14:02.073
like George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.441
Don't panic, son.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.343
We can bust up Teachy
and Preachy.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.045
Here's what we do:
I'll take Flanders out

14:07.047 --> 14:09.280
and remind him of the joys
of the single life.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.316
You scare Rod and Todd
by telling them

14:11.318 --> 14:14.219
Krabappel will become
their evil stepmother.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.588
If fairy tales have
taught us one thing,

14:16.590 --> 14:18.389
it's that first wives
are perfect,

14:18.391 --> 14:19.958
second wives are horrible.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.161
Just the opposite
of real life.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.029
Yeah, isn't this place great?

14:25.031 --> 14:28.099
If you're single, you can
come here every night.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.167
I don't want to come here.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.135
Last time I did, someone
slipped me a Mickey

14:31.137 --> 14:32.971
and wrote "Churchy Joe"
on my face.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.138
(snickering)
(snickering)

14:34.140 --> 14:37.475
It's your own fault.
You gotta read the coaster.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.346
FLANDERS:
Oh, my.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.481
Ned, let's cut to the chase.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.282
Yeah, let me guess.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.950
You're probably gonna do
something boneheaded

14:45.952 --> 14:47.886
like try to talk me
out of seeing Edna.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.087
Ned, if it's
boneheaded to talk

14:49.089 --> 14:53.625
you out of seeing Edna, then
I don't wanna be brainheaded.

14:53.627 --> 14:54.893
Homer, listen to me.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.128
For a long time now I've been
lookin' over the fence

14:57.130 --> 14:59.397
at that wonderful relationship
you have with Marge.

14:59.399 --> 15:03.501
Then I remember what it was like
to have a sweet woman of my own

15:03.503 --> 15:04.636
lying in a twin bed

15:04.638 --> 15:05.637
across the hall
from mine.

15:05.639 --> 15:09.374
Someone to hold the other end
of the sheet when I fold it up.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.475
Someone to put in my prayers.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.677
(voice breaking):
Oh, Ned, I never dreamed

15:12.679 --> 15:17.215
that beneath those iddilies and
diddilies there was a dude.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.517
That's right.
And like any man, I put on

15:19.519 --> 15:23.554
my secret Christian underpants
one leg at a time.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.390
(sobbing)

15:25.392 --> 15:29.027
Oh, you beautiful,
beautiful wuss.

15:29.029 --> 15:33.264
And Cinderella's stepmom
made her sew clothes

15:33.266 --> 15:35.133
and mop the floor.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.068
We do that already.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.569
Wanna see me
load a bobbin?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.038
No, I...
Give me that shirt.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.940
I'll patch the hole
in the armpit.

15:41.942 --> 15:46.444
(Todd and Rod humming "Battle
Hymn of the Republic")

15:46.446 --> 15:47.512
Haw haw.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.981
Can I get this
by Tuesday?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.583
Ned, I have a
confession to make:

15:52.585 --> 15:53.484
I may not have come here

15:53.486 --> 15:55.687
solely with the noble
intention of getting drunk.

15:55.689 --> 15:58.289
But now, from the
bottom of my heart,

15:58.291 --> 16:00.491
I wish you
and Edna the best.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.292
Fellow barflies.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.362
To Ned Flanders and
Edna Krabappel.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.330
What a fox.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.197
Yeah, to Edna.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.465
Yeah, that broad
is some dame.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.267
You all know Edna?

16:09.269 --> 16:10.168
Oh, yeah, man.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.603
(chuckles):
Everybody knows Edna.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.172
We made sweet music
in the band room,

16:14.174 --> 16:17.008
poetry during English class,
and you don't want to know

16:17.010 --> 16:19.477
what we did in
the multipurpose room.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.278
Shut up.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.348
My e-mail address is
Edna-lover-one-seventy-two.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.450
It was the lowest number
I could get.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.653
Guys, quit telling the truth.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.122
Yeah, Edna's amazing.

16:31.124 --> 16:31.723
Joey Kramer?

16:31.725 --> 16:33.591
The drummer from Aerosmith?

16:33.593 --> 16:35.059
Yup, that's me.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.227
And after a night with Edna,

16:36.229 --> 16:40.064
I couldn't walk this way,
that way, or any other way.

16:40.066 --> 16:40.498
Ooh la la.

16:40.500 --> 16:45.069
Wait, you've all plucked
a peach from her tree?

16:45.071 --> 16:46.237
Uh... Uh...

16:46.239 --> 16:50.308
So Joey, is Wikipedia accurate
when it says "Walk This Way"

16:50.310 --> 16:52.310
was inspired by
<i>Young Frankenstein?</i>

16:52.312 --> 16:54.779
Well Homer, you really
put one over

16:54.781 --> 16:57.448
on old stupid Flanders, here.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.516
Thanks a lot, neighbor.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.618
Don't you mean "neighboreeno"?

17:00.620 --> 17:03.154
No. Just plain neighbor.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.228
You stupid jerks.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.663
I can't believe
you could be so cruel.

17:12.665 --> 17:16.534
Especially you, Joey Kramer.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.204
Ned, is anything wrong?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.273
You've been acting
distracted all night.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.209
Oh, I was just wondering
how many boxes of staples

17:25.211 --> 17:26.644
I should order for the store.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.113
Does ten sound like
a lot to you?

17:29.115 --> 17:30.114
20? 50?

17:30.116 --> 17:31.649
What does sound
like a lot to you?

17:31.651 --> 17:34.085
What exactly are we
talking about here?

17:34.087 --> 17:37.288
Eh, maybe we should
just call it a night.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.689
Oh, okay.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.258
See you tomorrow?

17:41.127 --> 17:43.528
LENNY: Yeah, give me a
kiss, Neddy boy.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.796
SKINNER: That's right.
Kiss all the men

17:44.798 --> 17:47.765
that have ever made their way
to Edna's adventurous tongue.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.699
COMIC BOOK GUY:
Including me.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.736
I shall be discreet in my tweets
but brutal in my blog.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.807
JOEY: We made love
in so many elevators.

17:55.809 --> 17:58.109
PATTY:
Experiment.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.410
What is it?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.813
(panting):
I can't do it.

18:01.815 --> 18:03.548
Edna, call me Delta Airlines

18:03.550 --> 18:05.883
'cause I can't handle
your extra baggage.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.086
MOE: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.755
No leavin' until we all spook
you on Edna's face.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.758
All right, pipe down back there,
you'll get your chance.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.527
Oh come on, Moe, quit
hoggin' her face.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.664
(screaming)

18:23.303 --> 18:25.636
I hope you're proud
of yourself, Homer.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.873
I've got some bad
news for you, Marge.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.875
I'm actually not.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.311
Well, there's Ned
out on his power walk.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.412
Maybe you should talk to him.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.681
What?
My doctor said "don't walk."

18:36.683 --> 18:38.850
That was a traffic signal.

18:38.852 --> 18:39.584
Hmm.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.553
He's a good man
and a good neighbor,

18:42.555 --> 18:45.623
and you're drinking coffee
from his mug right now.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.559
(groans)

18:49.529 --> 18:52.230
Hey, Flanders, hold up.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.665
I-I know you're
not comfortable

18:54.667 --> 18:57.602
with all the guys Edna's
seen around town.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.870
And country.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.271
Ned, I've...

19:00.273 --> 19:03.241
Oh... learned
that the only way

19:03.243 --> 19:07.678
a relationship survives
is by forgiving.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.615
Endless, endless forgiving.

19:10.617 --> 19:14.619
(gasps)

19:15.288 --> 19:17.855
And didn't the Easter
Bunny himself say

19:17.857 --> 19:21.225
"Forgive them, father,
for finding all my eggs"?

19:21.227 --> 19:24.562
And if a giant rabbit can
lay chocolate eggs,

19:24.564 --> 19:28.366
maybe you and Edna can find
a way to make it work.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.368
(gasps)

19:33.406 --> 19:36.374
(yelling)

19:36.676 --> 19:38.843
Edna, I had a long talk with
Homer Simpson yesterday,

19:38.845 --> 19:42.780
and as I was carrying
him back home, I had a
lot of time to think.

19:42.782 --> 19:48.219
You've been with a lot of
men, but I forgive you.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.423
You "forgive" me?

19:52.425 --> 19:54.258
You sanctimonious prude.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.460
Who are you to judge
how I've lived my life?

19:56.462 --> 20:01.432
Ned, I'm not ashamed of dating
those men, I'm proud.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.302
I still wear
your bra.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.271
Well, not exactly proud,
but I'm stuck.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.307
Ned, if we're gonna
stay together,

20:09.309 --> 20:11.609
you have to promise that
my past will never,

20:11.611 --> 20:13.644
ever get in our way.
(sighs)

20:13.646 --> 20:18.249
I guess this is gonna have to
be decided by a higher power.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.851
So we're going to let
the Internet decide.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.287
Should Ned and Edna
stay together?

20:23.289 --> 20:25.556
Visit thesimpsons.com and vote.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.593
We'll announce the results in
next year's season premiere.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.828
Probably at the end, so you'll
watch the whole thing.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.599
There's a whole host of voting
options-- friends with benefits,

20:34.601 --> 20:38.302
frenemies with frenefits,
super friends with wonder pets,

20:38.304 --> 20:39.537
all designed to distract you

20:39.539 --> 20:41.472
while we take your
personal information

20:41.474 --> 20:44.875
and use it to apply for
credit cards in your name.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.445
Homer, stop teasing.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.613
Right.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.347
Teasing.

20:49.349 --> 20:49.981
I'm waitin' for ya.

20:49.983 --> 20:53.351
Also, if you wanna find the
real shooter of Mr. Burns,

20:53.353 --> 20:54.986
go back and look
for more clues.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.287
They're all there.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.955
Homie, it was Maggie.

20:57.957 --> 20:58.889
Yeah, right.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.791
A baby shot a guy.

21:00.793 --> 21:06.230
Just vote. It's your duty
as a citizen of TV.

21:10.036 --> 21:14.872
If you're watching this
in reruns or on a DVD,
it's too late to vote.

21:14.874 --> 21:18.309
And if you are,
where were you
the first time?

21:18.311 --> 21:19.810
Fans like you,
we don't need.

21:19.812 --> 21:24.348
As far as I'm concerned,
you shouldn't watch it
in any form.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.816
Homer, don't insult our fans.

21:25.818 --> 21:28.352
Even if they can't vote,
there will always be

21:28.354 --> 21:31.756
lots of great stuff
at thesimpsons.com.

21:31.758 --> 21:32.890
Unless there's no more Internet.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.426
In that case, either we're
living under Sharia law

21:35.428 --> 21:38.296
or the machines from rise
and the machines have risen.

21:38.298 --> 21:43.701
Okay. Then put the next DVD
in the machine or in your brain

21:43.703 --> 21:45.069
or however they do it now,

21:45.071 --> 21:48.539
and find out how the once-great
human race voted

21:48.541 --> 21:50.808
about a teacher dating
a neighbor.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.078
If I'm dead,
avenge my death.
Shh!
