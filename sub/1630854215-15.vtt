WEBVTT

00:03.129 --> 00:04.004
Come on.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.468
Stop looking at me.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.859
Pancakes. The Peanut is thrilled.

00:24.859 --> 00:28.070
You are wearing the maternity jeans
I bought you.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.655
Glad you're happy about that.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.240
You're 28 weeks pregnant.

00:31.240 --> 00:35.286
Your weight has increased 21.5 pounds,
and our baby is moving lower.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.747
At least there's pancakes.,

00:37.747 --> 00:40.207
- We need to buy a minivan.
- No, we don't.

00:40.583 --> 00:43.085
The Striped Tomato
has no infant safety features.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.464
Shaun, I just surrendered
to maternity jeans,

00:46.464 --> 00:49.550
this is not the right time
for broaching the "Mom-mobile."

00:49.675 --> 00:51.594
When would be the right time?

00:52.428 --> 00:54.847
These are amazing. Did you use buttermilk?

00:54.847 --> 00:55.806
Greek yogurt?

00:56.807 --> 00:59.143
I'll email you my list
of child-safe vehicles.

00:59.143 --> 01:00.978
We can discuss it during lunch.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.079
Sonja Baylor?

01:27.129 --> 01:30.591
Who's the Code Gold? Taylor Swift?
Did her broken heart give out?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.760
Better. Roland Barnes.

01:34.303 --> 01:35.971
<i>The green tech guy?</i>

01:35.971 --> 01:38.349
- He's attacked by a tiger.
- In San Jose?

01:38.349 --> 01:40.559
At his animal rescue
in Santa Cruz mountains,

01:40.559 --> 01:42.895
concierge doc called
to say they're on the way.

01:42.895 --> 01:45.064
San Jose General is much closer.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.982
- Why'd he come here?
- Because of you.

01:47.608 --> 01:51.362
Deep chest wall lacerations,
multiple rib fractures, hemopneumothorax.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.863
I stabilized him.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.156
But he needs a CT, Stat.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.242
- Dr. Kalu.
- Dr. Andrews.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.248
Good to see you, Dr. Murphy.

02:02.498 --> 02:04.875
Hello, Jared.

02:05.251 --> 02:07.419
A famous billionaire and a cute reunion?

02:07.419 --> 02:09.046
This is almost Swift-worthy.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.435
Is Leo a decent poker player?

02:24.311 --> 02:28.023
<i>Us Weekly</i> has photos of Roland
coming out of his game last week.

02:28.691 --> 02:29.692
Won my Lambo off him.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.364
No sign of trauma to the liver or spleen.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.367
Beyonce did a private show
for his birthday?

02:38.367 --> 02:39.368
It was awesome.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.371
No major intra-peritoneal hematoma.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.373
Moving on to the chest.

02:47.960 --> 02:52.339
So, how does one go
from St. Bon's resident

02:52.339 --> 02:56.385
to concierge doc
for the fifth richest man in the world?

02:57.553 --> 03:00.556
I was working at Denver Memorial
when I met Roland,

03:00.973 --> 03:02.892
at a fundraiser hosted by my parents.

03:03.976 --> 03:07.396
His wife collapsed during
the silent auction. Nutmeg allergy.

03:07.563 --> 03:10.107
I gave her epi, then helped her
outbid John Legend

03:10.107 --> 03:12.318
for a weekend at an underwater hotel.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.570
Roland hired me that night.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.947
Why does he need a personal physician?

03:16.947 --> 03:19.575
Does he often get attacked
by wild animals?

03:20.659 --> 03:21.994
Chronic sciatica.

03:23.120 --> 03:27.666
And he travels a lot, so there's vaccines.
Plus botox injections,

03:27.666 --> 03:30.711
cholesterol scrips,
medical advice for friends and family.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.296
Why'd you leave St. Bons?

03:32.421 --> 03:35.507
He was fired for assaulting
an attending who harassed Claire,

03:35.507 --> 03:37.176
then he sued the hospital.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.011
- You're that guy.
- Yeah.

03:39.011 --> 03:41.388
I heard Andrews wasn't your biggest fan.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.515
I'm surprised he let me in the building.

03:45.476 --> 03:49.188
Depressed and dislocated sternum,
manubrium, and rib fractures.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.858
Too fragmented
for standard sternal reconstruction.

04:02.493 --> 04:03.911
He still does this?

04:04.703 --> 04:05.955
Always makes my day.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.123
I have an idea.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.169
This is why I brought Roland here.

04:17.007 --> 04:17.925
It's a girl.

04:19.301 --> 04:20.719
We're naming her Esther.

04:21.220 --> 04:25.057
We hope she'll be brave and selfless
like Queen Esther.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.725
Baddest bitch in the Bible.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.727
How are that mud's going?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.939
- Fine.
- Any excessive discharge?

04:32.564 --> 04:36.944
A couple of days ago, I was on a walk
and was a little like I peed myself.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.907
Could that be from the MilliDox?

04:43.033 --> 04:45.077
No. You're actually on the placebo.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.330
Your amniotic fluid is a bit low.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.833
We should admit you for further testing.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.879
He asked for you.
Inoperable leiomyosarcoma

04:55.879 --> 04:57.881
with major vascular involvement.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.429
What're you doing here?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.348
I'm dying.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.271
My doctors say there's nothing
they can do for me.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.150
I'm hoping you can.

05:18.444 --> 05:21.030
We should get a CT and PET scan.

05:21.822 --> 05:22.698
Fine.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.246
We'll completely rebuild your sternum

05:29.246 --> 05:31.373
and anterior chest wall with donor bones

05:31.373 --> 05:34.168
and titanium plates.
It's a very complicated surgery.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.545
Jared says you're a damn good surgeon.

05:37.171 --> 05:40.382
Yes, I am a damn good surgeon.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.595
He is. And I'll be overseeing your care
every step of the way.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.807
Appreciate the personal attention.
I want Jared there, too.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.809
Jared is my doctor.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.562
Dr. Kalu will be read in
on every major decision.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.980
I want him in the OR.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.819
I'll fast-track your surgical privileges.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.380
Something's going on between you two.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.342
I'm very perceptive that way.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.344
It's a long story.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.515
Saw in his chart he's from Phoenix.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.727
He broke his arm a couple years ago
in a Tae Kwon Do match, your sport.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.605
So I'm going with
he's your Johnny Lawrence

06:36.605 --> 06:39.566
who cheated during the match
at the All Valley tournament.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.693
I've been watching a lot of <i>Cobra Kai.</i>

06:43.904 --> 06:45.239
He slept with my wife.

06:45.239 --> 06:48.575
So, yes to the cheating.
No to the tournament.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.420
This is from six months ago.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.883
This is from today.

07:06.135 --> 07:08.887
A leiomyosarcoma should've progressed
more than that.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.681
Maybe they had the diagnosis wrong.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.526
Release the pectoral muscles
from attachment medially.

07:22.526 --> 07:26.113
Should I place the low profile plate?

07:26.113 --> 07:29.533
Don't you need to create
a landing zone for the fixation?

07:31.493 --> 07:32.786
He is right.

07:34.371 --> 07:38.125
Get a better exposure by elevating
the right pectoral from the ribs.

07:40.085 --> 07:44.173
I understand SF General's Cardiac Unit
is named after your boss.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.926
And that he sponsored
a surgical exchange program with Haiti.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.889
Would you like to place the screws?

07:53.765 --> 07:54.808
Very much so.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.935
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.606
Drill guide, self-tapping screws.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.987
Feels good.

08:08.280 --> 08:12.951
You have been very polite to Dr. Kalu
despite having fired him.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.996
Is that because you want
a donation from Roland?

08:18.457 --> 08:19.833
- It's okay.
- It's true.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.586
Dr. Kalu and I didn't part
on the best terms.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.755
But I'm happy you found your niche.

08:25.547 --> 08:30.177
And I believe in the work we do here.
Roland Barnes can help us do even more.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.888
I told Roland
this was the best hospital in the state.

08:32.888 --> 08:36.016
When we get him healthy,
I'd be happy to tell him again.

08:38.685 --> 08:41.063
BP's dropping. Cardiac output's awful.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.231
He's in heart failure.

08:42.231 --> 08:44.316
The cardiac contusion was missed on CT.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.277
Need a balloon pump
to help his heart circulate more blood.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.155
We need to get it
in five minutes or he dies.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.119
BP's stabilized.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.706
Cardiac output is improving.
He should make a full recovery,

08:59.706 --> 09:02.709
but he should not get so close
to jungle cats in the future.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.423
In the OR... I've really missed that.

09:09.424 --> 09:12.511
Then why did you stop being a surgeon?

09:12.511 --> 09:16.390
Working for Roland was too interesting
an opportunity to pass up.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.850
Is sciatica interesting to you?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.269
It's more...

09:20.435 --> 09:23.230
- I came as soon as I heard... Poor Rolly.
- Hey.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.899
This is my girlfriend, Dalia.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.817
Hi.

09:27.818 --> 09:28.652
You...

09:29.778 --> 09:34.283
I've seen you on the bus... in a perfume ad.

09:40.205 --> 09:43.166
Fern test confirms it's
a premature rupture of the membranes.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.669
We should terminate
before an infection sets in.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.714
What about in-patient expectant
management and antibiotics?

09:48.714 --> 09:50.757
PPROM pregnancies can be carried to term.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.093
Rarely. When they are,
babies are likely to have

09:53.093 --> 09:55.137
cerebral palsy, neurologic abnormalities,

09:55.137 --> 09:57.264
- intellectual disability.
- We'll tell them,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.182
but this is a badly wanted pregnancy.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.184
They've been trying for five years.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.687
Had two first trimester
miscarriages already.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.897
Saving the baby may be her priority.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.274
But saving her is ours.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.651
Sonja is our patient.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.363
We should explain her options
but recommend termination.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.366
Morgan is right.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.369
But be clear about the options.

10:23.582 --> 10:26.835
The seat springs allow the car seat
to move more than one inch,

10:27.794 --> 10:30.047
which creates additional injury risk.

10:30.047 --> 10:33.175
There are no over shoulder
seatbelts for the car seat,

10:33.175 --> 10:36.386
no crumple zone,
and you'd have to install a roll-cage,

10:36.386 --> 10:39.473
which still wouldn't be as reliable
as one built in.

10:39.473 --> 10:42.434
Since you hate minivans,
I have looked into hatchbacks

10:42.434 --> 10:45.020
and SUVs with sufficient safety features.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.065
It's not just about hating minivans.

10:48.899 --> 10:51.276
- What is it about?
- I love this car.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.861
It's my history.

10:52.861 --> 10:56.531
My brother and I restored it,
used to drive it to shows at the Fillmore.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.618
You and I took it on our first road trip.
I can't sell it.

10:59.618 --> 11:04.373
Then we do not have to. As long as
you never put the Peanut in it.

11:04.373 --> 11:05.791
We still need a family car.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.001
Yeah, we do.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.089
Roland's awake.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.847
But it's possible
that we could save our baby?

11:21.932 --> 11:23.141
You'd have to live here.

11:23.141 --> 11:26.311
We'd monitor you every day,
give you prophylactic antibiotics

11:26.311 --> 11:28.980
and steroids
when the baby gets closer to viability.

11:28.980 --> 11:32.901
To be clear, even with all that,
you may still develop

11:32.901 --> 11:36.863
a serious uterine infection
that could require a hysterectomy

11:36.863 --> 11:38.824
or cause fatal complications.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.373
I think we should terminate.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.798
What would you do...

11:56.383 --> 11:57.843
if it was your baby?

11:58.427 --> 12:00.178
Termination is the safest.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.888
I was talking to Dr. Allen.

12:07.602 --> 12:11.314
I would... pray on it.

12:14.901 --> 12:15.986
And then?

12:19.406 --> 12:21.366
I want to know what you would do.

12:35.922 --> 12:41.136
I think I... would try to save the baby.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.645
We have to fight for our Esther.

12:59.029 --> 13:02.824
We need a biopsy before we can
give you any definitive answer.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.494
Okay.

13:06.161 --> 13:07.496
So when do we do that?

13:08.914 --> 13:11.875
I'll give you a referral
to take to another doctor.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.127
If I wanted another doctor, I would have.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.546
- I don't have to treat you.
- But you will.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.591
You're not a quitter.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.053
You worked hard to save your marriage.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.055
You never tapped out in a fight.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.058
I always admired your persistence.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.394
And kind of hated it, too.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.487
Looking back at my life,

13:42.280 --> 13:43.990
I don't like the view.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.702
I hurt...

13:49.454 --> 13:50.705
a lot of people.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.877
That's the real reason that I came here.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.005
For forgiveness.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.688
The intra-aortic balloon pump worked.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.189
You won't need a new heart.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.315
Great.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.234
So when can I get out of here?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.903
Not for a few days.

14:21.903 --> 14:25.865
We need to monitor you
for post-surgical complications.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.576
Your heart rate is elevated.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.369
Have you been exerting yourself?

14:35.709 --> 14:37.127
She did most of the exerting.

14:41.673 --> 14:46.469
I need 1,000 mg levetiracetam
and 4 mg lorazepam. Stat.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.014
Is Rolly gonna be okay?

15:01.776 --> 15:03.111
Roland had a seizure.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.407
You should sit down.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.837
Dalia was there.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.174
Naked.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.010
They were having sex.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.976
Dalia and I aren't together,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.270
she's with Roland.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.772
That's part of the gig.

15:39.230 --> 15:43.109
I pretend she's with me,
so Roland's wife doesn't get suspicious.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.154
Okay.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.490
You think the sex caused seizure?

15:49.366 --> 15:51.993
Arousal can increase the heart rate by 38%

15:51.993 --> 15:54.079
and if his brain was deprived of oxygen,

15:54.079 --> 15:56.081
it'd cause a seizure, which would mean

15:56.081 --> 15:58.416
his heart's still not pumping
enough blood.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.587
Does it bother you to have to lie
on a regular basis?

16:03.213 --> 16:06.341
It's not my favorite responsibility,
but it's a great job, so...

16:06.341 --> 16:07.759
Why is it a great job?

16:12.722 --> 16:16.267
On my last day, you told me
that one day I'd be very happy.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.061
But I was miserable.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.896
I felt like a failure.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.693
Then I met Roland,
and he saw something in me.

16:25.819 --> 16:31.825
This guy that I really admired,
that the world admired, he valued me.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.412
I don't mind flying private to Amsterdam

16:35.412 --> 16:37.956
to have rijsttafel
with the Queen of Netherlands.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.959
I also said
you would fulfill your potential.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.752
I'm not doing that?

16:43.628 --> 16:44.462
No.

16:46.965 --> 16:47.882
Sciatica.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.472
Thanks for reminding me
I'm still a failure.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.061
I'll get a BNP Test and echo
to check out his heart.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.654
Inject saline
to get us to submucosal plane.

17:13.658 --> 17:16.536
- Why'd you stay on the case?
- There's the tumor.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.582
He was right.
I take my obligations seriously.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.666
Take four samples.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.546
Not because some part of you
wants to forgive him?

17:27.172 --> 17:28.715
Withdraw the scope slowly.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.636
He doesn't deserve it.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.727
Let's start with a sofa.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.978
Let's take a look.

17:42.312 --> 17:46.149
Finally, somebody recognizes
my interior design genius.

17:46.524 --> 17:47.776
It looks nice.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.987
- Very.
- Hey. I love this. I'll take it.

17:50.987 --> 17:54.324
No. This is literally
the first thing you've sat on.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.577
Okay, I'll sit in 10 other ones,
and then I'll take this one.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.580
No. If you know you like something,
stick with it.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.583
Like my car.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.586
Shaun wants to buy a minivan.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.256
You want to put an infant
in a '75 Gran Torino?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.759
No, it's not safe for a baby.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.011
But...

18:16.596 --> 18:17.847
it is...

18:19.641 --> 18:20.683
cool.

18:22.060 --> 18:26.856
Even when I'm going
to my super grown-up job,

18:26.856 --> 18:29.025
in my lady-boss pantsuit,

18:30.735 --> 18:34.155
I get out of that car and I'm cool.

18:34.572 --> 18:41.496
And soon, I'll be just another
30-something mom in a practical car,

18:41.496 --> 18:44.707
baby seat in the back
and spit-up on my shirt.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.504
Maddie's mom used to warn me
to take two shirts

18:49.504 --> 18:51.631
whenever I went out with the baby.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.341
I learned the hard way.

18:53.341 --> 18:57.762
How do I want this baby so badly,

18:58.805 --> 19:01.933
but feel so icked out about being a mom?

19:04.102 --> 19:05.395
Define "icked out."

19:06.104 --> 19:07.146
Like...

19:11.025 --> 19:14.070
- I know.
- Okay. That's well said.

19:15.113 --> 19:18.366
You got mixed emotions.
Welcome to the human condition.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.160
I'm gonna take this one.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.333
Her fever spiked, she's in a lot of pain.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.752
Her heart rate's 117.
Fetal heart rate 180.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.212
They're both tachycardic.

19:31.212 --> 19:34.382
500 milligrams acetaminophen
and start ampicillin.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.722
This is the infection
we were worried about.

19:42.181 --> 19:46.144
Your baby is very unlikely to survive,

19:46.936 --> 19:48.605
and your life is in danger.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.107
We need to terminate now.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.738
But her heart's still beating.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.908
Esther can only stay alive in utero.

20:00.408 --> 20:04.078
And as long as she's in there,
you'll keep getting sicker.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.207
I'm so sorry.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.546
I'm here. We can get through this.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.049
We can try again.

20:22.096 --> 20:22.972
No.

20:28.895 --> 20:32.857
Your baby needs at least
two more weeks to be viable.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.527
And if we wait that long,
you will probably die.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.114
"If I perish, I perish."

20:41.199 --> 20:42.742
That's what Queen Esther said

20:42.742 --> 20:44.827
before she risked her life for her family.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.039
Sonja...

20:49.707 --> 20:50.959
"If I perish...

20:54.754 --> 20:55.797
I perish."

21:03.721 --> 21:06.307
According to the BNP test and echo,

21:06.557 --> 21:08.893
your seizure
wasn't related to heart trauma.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.521
The EEG will let us assess your brain.

21:11.521 --> 21:12.855
So what's your pitch?

21:12.855 --> 21:15.108
Hospital presidents don't supervise EEGs.

21:18.653 --> 21:22.448
I've been impressed by your
Global Engineers Initiative.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.742
I think we can do the same with medicine.

21:24.742 --> 21:28.287
Train doctors from the developing world
to take care of their people.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.665
What makes St. Bon's the place to do it?

21:30.665 --> 21:34.669
We're hands on here. Our residents
don't just do appies and lap choles.

21:34.669 --> 21:38.506
With the guidance of our attendings,
they come up with complex treatments,

21:38.506 --> 21:40.550
untangle the thorniest ethical dilemmas

21:40.550 --> 21:43.428
and learn how to provide
top-notch patient care.

21:43.428 --> 21:47.598
If we could sponsor more residents
from the developing world,

21:47.598 --> 21:50.184
we'll send them home ready
to serve communities.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.645
But Jared, who I trust with my life,

21:52.645 --> 21:56.107
wasn't good enough to be one
of those residents. You fired him.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.777
You saw something in him I missed.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.613
But I'm seeing it now.
I've granted him full access.

22:02.613 --> 22:06.242
Very politic answer. What do you think,
has he earned my money?

22:08.244 --> 22:10.496
I learned a tremendous amount
at St. Bon's.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.832
As you've experienced,
the care is top-notch.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.001
Unfortunately, the food isn't.

22:15.001 --> 22:20.339
Text Dalia and ask her to bring us back
some of those pork buns from Yank Sing.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.508
Dalia went into the city?

22:22.508 --> 22:23.885
To meet up with friends.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.053
You're okay with that?

22:25.053 --> 22:26.512
Why wouldn't I be?

22:27.305 --> 22:28.306
No reason.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.684
All right, let's start this.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.311
Close your eyes and relax.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.982
Labs confirm Sonja has chorioamnionitis.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.026
We should add gentamicin.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.778
That'll damage the baby's kidneys.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.946
It's our only way to keep Sonja alive.

22:43.946 --> 22:47.492
Buys us time to convince her to terminate.
She's being suicidal.

22:47.492 --> 22:50.661
Risking your life for your child
is considered admirable.

22:50.661 --> 22:55.083
Not if you're both going to die,
because of the false hope you gave her.

22:55.416 --> 22:56.834
I answered her question.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.086
You gave her permission.

22:58.086 --> 23:00.713
We're supposed to at least
try to be objective.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.716
Objectivity is a myth,
especially on this subject.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.135
I know the pain Sonja's grappling with.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.178
So do I.

23:14.143 --> 23:19.482
I was in med school, on birth control,
and I got pregnant anyway.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.861
I wasn't ready for a kid.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.447
I was scared.

23:27.615 --> 23:28.574
And sad.

23:30.493 --> 23:31.702
And relieved.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.705
It was a medical procedure
I had years ago,

23:34.705 --> 23:36.499
and I'm at peace with it now.

23:37.041 --> 23:37.959
Most women are.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.170
Because it was their choice,

23:41.170 --> 23:45.341
a choice you got to make and I did, too.
Let Sonja make hers.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.010
It's not our job
to help patients choose death.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.391
Her lungs are failing.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.986
Her O2 sats are falling, fever's climbing.

24:05.319 --> 24:06.487
Intubation cart.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.614
Administer propofol and rocuronium.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.908
We need to sedate you so we can intubate.

24:10.908 --> 24:13.619
That'll keep you breathing.
But the only way...

24:14.370 --> 24:15.496
You can't kill her.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.707
Esther's life before mine.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.750
- Sonja, please...
- Promise me.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.587
- I can't...
- Promise me.

24:31.971 --> 24:32.847
Anthony...

24:38.519 --> 24:39.395
I...

24:40.104 --> 24:41.397
I promise.

24:44.692 --> 24:45.776
I love you.

24:57.622 --> 25:00.708
Check out the activity in the left
frontal lobe on Roland's EEG.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.168
Interictal spikes.

25:02.293 --> 25:04.921
They're very small, likely incidental.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.799
Roland's selfish and possessive.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.385
He hates it when people
have fun without him.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.597
But today he was fine with Dalia
hanging with friends.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.767
Being unselfish is a symptom.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.727
Maybe one of his wounds got infected?

25:19.727 --> 25:22.355
Bacterial encephalitis
from the claws or teeth?

25:22.355 --> 25:24.065
This could be subtle edema.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.234
Plus behavior changes
and interictal spikes.

25:26.234 --> 25:27.818
Sounds like neurocysticercosis.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.404
- A tapeworm cyst...
- With larva in the brain.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.033
It would take a tape worm weeks

25:34.033 --> 25:36.410
to fully form larva
and cysts in his brain.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.329
The attack was two days ago.

25:41.791 --> 25:45.211
Roland's last "local safari" was about
two months ago.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.630
And he fell into
a giant pile of tiger crap...

25:48.589 --> 25:50.508
We can remove the cyst and larva

25:50.508 --> 25:53.386
with stereotactic navigation
and hydrodissection.

25:53.678 --> 25:54.595
Awesome.

25:58.641 --> 25:59.892
You're not a failure.

26:05.940 --> 26:06.857
Seriously?

26:07.066 --> 26:08.442
Four guesses?

26:08.693 --> 26:09.652
I got it in two.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.572
What's up with you?

26:14.907 --> 26:16.033
You lose a patient?

26:18.452 --> 26:19.787
Actually, I might save one.

26:22.540 --> 26:23.416
Joe.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.334
Mia's Joe?

26:26.544 --> 26:28.379
Waiting on his biopsy results.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.632
They asked me to forgive him.

26:32.925 --> 26:33.843
What'd you say?

26:34.552 --> 26:35.928
I refused.

26:37.972 --> 26:39.140
You would've, too.

26:39.807 --> 26:40.725
Maybe.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.562
I'm capable of letting things go.

26:44.562 --> 26:45.980
I can let things go.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.191
I prioritized my career for a day,

26:49.191 --> 26:51.694
which you decided was unacceptable.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.863
Even after I changed my mind.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.409
How long did it take you to forgive Mia?

26:59.368 --> 27:00.244
Dr. Park?

27:03.706 --> 27:04.999
Your diagnosis is in.

27:13.132 --> 27:17.219
Right this way. Guys, be careful.
You've got history, you're carrying.

27:20.848 --> 27:22.808
There's a couple of steps. Be careful.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.894
Thanks, guys. First door on the right.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.520
Stadium seats?

27:26.520 --> 27:31.067
Authentic, Candlestick Park stadium seats.
Got them from a broker.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.860
- Very cool.
- Right?

27:32.860 --> 27:35.237
- Thanks for the inspiration.
- You're welcome.

27:36.614 --> 27:39.033
Your turn next. Get your coat.

27:42.828 --> 27:46.874
You have a stromal tumor in your stomach,
and a small lesion on your liver.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.292
We can remove both.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.503
You'll be cancer free.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.343
That's incredible.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.261
Thank you.

28:00.805 --> 28:01.889
You get it, right?

28:02.848 --> 28:04.058
You're not dying.

28:05.309 --> 28:06.143
Yes.

28:07.645 --> 28:09.021
This is amazing.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.566
I'm so grateful.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.821
- But--
- That's not why you came here.

28:36.507 --> 28:40.719
Sonja will likely be in multiorgan failure
within the next 48 hours.

28:41.178 --> 28:44.056
When that happens,
Esther will not survive.

28:46.100 --> 28:50.187
But if we terminate now, Sonja still can.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.816
You can save your wife's life.

28:55.443 --> 28:56.694
It's all up to you.

29:10.708 --> 29:11.625
He says...

29:13.461 --> 29:14.628
he says he can't do it.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.424
He needs to keep his promise.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.181
I know what to do.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.153
Sorry, man.

29:39.612 --> 29:40.446
Bring it.

29:53.876 --> 29:54.752
Are you okay?

30:05.763 --> 30:08.015
A worm laid eggs in my skull.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.099
Larva.

30:10.601 --> 30:12.853
You were right. Murphy's the best.

30:14.688 --> 30:17.775
What would you say
to a hundred million dollars?

30:22.321 --> 30:25.866
I'd say that's remarkably generous.

30:26.617 --> 30:27.952
You can't accept it.

30:29.620 --> 30:32.873
You are not medically fit to be
making any major decisions

30:32.873 --> 30:34.291
because of the larva.

30:34.875 --> 30:38.462
I closed a huge deal last week
with Mr. Worm as my consigliere.

30:38.462 --> 30:39.838
I feel pretty competent.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.759
Well, I'd be happy to accept your money
after the surgery.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.106
Sonja. It's okay.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.233
I turned off your sedation.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.403
I need to talk to you.

31:03.028 --> 31:06.115
I'm gonna let go of your hands,
but you can't pull out the tube.

31:21.005 --> 31:22.965
When I was 18,

31:24.300 --> 31:25.634
I had an abortion.

31:28.470 --> 31:32.016
That child would have been 11 now.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.602
Just starting middle school.

31:36.437 --> 31:39.023
Every time I see a kid that age,

31:39.898 --> 31:42.484
I think about who they would have become.

31:43.193 --> 31:45.696
Or what kind of mom I would have been.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.784
I believe God's forgiven me.

31:52.036 --> 31:53.662
That's kind of His thing.

31:55.873 --> 31:58.959
And I believe God picked you
from motherhood.

32:01.295 --> 32:02.671
You are so strong.

32:04.048 --> 32:05.841
So brave...

32:06.342 --> 32:09.053
with such a deep capacity for love.

32:16.018 --> 32:22.316
But your Esther, isn't developed enough
to survive outside the womb.

32:23.776 --> 32:26.028
The infection will kill both of you.

32:29.448 --> 32:33.535
I told you if I were you,
I would try to save the baby.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.457
I prayed for a miracle.

32:40.918 --> 32:43.170
I don't know why it didn't come today.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.634
The only way...

32:49.134 --> 32:52.346
for you to be the mom God wants you to be...

32:55.849 --> 32:57.434
is to let Esther go.

33:12.616 --> 33:14.535
Please sign this consent form.

34:06.879 --> 34:07.796
Yes.

34:20.809 --> 34:21.727
Speculum.

34:43.999 --> 34:46.668
If your soul has not yet left your body,

34:49.171 --> 34:50.798
I baptize you, Esther...

35:05.562 --> 35:08.649
Cervix is sufficiently dilated.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.746
Is the name of the Father,

35:23.914 --> 35:25.040
and of the Son,

35:27.668 --> 35:29.086
and of the Holy Spirit.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.216
Amen.

35:37.845 --> 35:38.762
Amen.

35:39.388 --> 35:40.597
- Amen.
- Amen.

36:07.833 --> 36:10.961
The margins were clean.
We were able to get all the tumors.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.255
No additional metastasis.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.799
Your prognosis is excellent.

36:17.843 --> 36:18.760
Thank you.

36:30.439 --> 36:31.481
I forgive you.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.037
Thank you.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.882
Extracting the cyst...

36:58.675 --> 36:59.843
and larva.

36:59.843 --> 37:00.928
Awesome.

37:02.763 --> 37:04.598
- And I might hurl.
- Let's close.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.019
Can Dr. Kalu do the closing?

37:10.938 --> 37:11.772
Be my guest.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.194
4-0 neurolon.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.199
You said you miss being a surgeon.

37:22.824 --> 37:27.162
If you complete your residency here,
you can do more than closing.

37:28.288 --> 37:32.626
I doubt he wants to go from five star
restaurants to hospital vending machines.

37:33.001 --> 37:38.298
Actually, someone helped me realize
I'd love a second chance here.

37:47.099 --> 37:51.770
The Chief of Surgery is responsible for
all hiring decisions in her department.

37:54.398 --> 37:56.108
I've learned a lot about myself.

37:56.858 --> 38:00.612
How to better communicate,
how to manage challenging personalities.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.116
I hear Roland can be a handful.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.202
Prepared me for tough patients
and attendings.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.373
My surgical skills is still sharp.

38:11.373 --> 38:13.208
Andrews let me do Roland's closing.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.043
I'm impressed.

38:16.003 --> 38:19.297
Murphy really wants you on his team,
that carries weight.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.343
But I don't have any openings
for third year residents.

38:26.805 --> 38:27.764
I understand.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.312
But I do have a slot for a first year.

38:57.794 --> 38:59.129
I'm so sorry...

39:00.088 --> 39:01.214
for your loss.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.488
So our Esther will always be with me.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.077
Someday,

39:31.495 --> 39:34.831
maybe we can tell her brothers and sisters
all about her.

39:54.309 --> 39:57.104
This car is perfect for the Peanut.

39:57.104 --> 39:58.855
And pretty cool, too.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.068
Let's take this rocketship for a ride.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.088
Dr. Andrews?

40:25.298 --> 40:26.383
Here's your check.

40:27.676 --> 40:31.138
And this is what happens
when you poach my employees.

40:45.569 --> 40:48.530
This is so good,
especially after a day like today.

40:51.241 --> 40:52.450
To our differences.

40:57.664 --> 40:58.748
Excuse me.

40:58.748 --> 41:01.251
Time to exercise my reproductive freedom.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.503
I'm doing a third round of IVF.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.629
Gonna go jab yourself

41:04.629 --> 41:07.007
in the belly alone
in the hospital bathroom?

41:09.176 --> 41:10.051
Gimme.

41:11.845 --> 41:12.846
I am a doctor.

41:15.932 --> 41:16.850
Have at it.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.150
To reuniting with old friends.

41:28.737 --> 41:33.742
And a mommy mocktail with fresh rosemary.

41:33.742 --> 41:36.870
Yum. Love having bougie Kalu back.

41:38.330 --> 41:39.372
To Jared...

41:41.166 --> 41:45.503
fulfilling his potential
as my new first year resident.

41:54.054 --> 41:55.347
It's probably Glassy.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.020
- You Doctor Shaun Murphy?
- Yes.

42:02.229 --> 42:05.482
I'm an attending surgeon
at St. Bonaventure hospital.

42:07.317 --> 42:08.735
You've just been served.

42:09.819 --> 42:11.655
You're being sued for malpractice.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.707
It wasn't Doctor Glassman.
