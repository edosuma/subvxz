08:21.001 --> 08:22.502
Keys.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.088
Okay.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.467
- Dad.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.467
- I'm sorry.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.219
- Yes!

08:28.508 --> 08:31.219
- 'Okay.'

08:31.261 --> 08:33.513
'Be careful opening the door.'

08:35.307 --> 08:39.436
- Okay, seat belts on.

08:35.307 --> 08:39.436
- Very good.

08:39.478 --> 08:42.189
Can I be any more responsible?

08:42.230 --> 08:45.233
Okay, and the car on.

08:45.275 --> 08:48.153
[engine cranking]

08:45.275 --> 08:48.153
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

08:45.275 --> 08:48.153
Aren't you forgetting something?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.280
Oh, yeah. Radio on.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.572
[instrumental music]

08:51.614 --> 08:53.867
Oh, dad.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.411
[rock music]

08:56.453 --> 08:58.372
Oh, Deej!

08:58.413 --> 09:01.958
Dad, I have to learn to drive

08:58.413 --> 09:01.958
with music like a normal person.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.710
I don't want you driving

09:02.000 --> 09:03.710
like a normal person.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.504
I want you driving like me.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.881
You just follow my instructions

09:05.545 --> 09:07.881
completely now, okay?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.841
First, adjust the mirrors.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.055
Very good.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.055
Now, Deej, listen to me.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.807
Get your radar out, okay?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.559
Examine the big picture.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.770
Check for traffic,

09:19.600 --> 09:22.770
pedestrians, stray cattle--

09:22.812 --> 09:25.773
Dad, we're in an empty

09:22.812 --> 09:25.773
parking lot.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.193
Are you gonna question

09:25.815 --> 09:28.193
every instruction I give you?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.903
Sorry.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.738
No cattle.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.409
Very good.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.409
Now secure the litter bag.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.035
This is unbelievable!

09:39.871 --> 09:42.499
Litter bag secure, sir.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.499
Anything else?

09:42.541 --> 09:44.334
No, I guess

09:42.541 --> 09:44.334
that about covers it.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.253
Why don't we just, uh,

09:44.376 --> 09:46.253
pack it in for today

09:46.294 --> 09:47.921
and let it all sink in?

09:47.962 --> 09:51.383
What?

09:47.962 --> 09:51.383
I didn't even get to drive.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.635
Okay, I guess we can move on

09:51.425 --> 09:54.635
to lesson number two.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.596
Okay, now..

09:56.637 --> 10:00.392
....with your hands holding the

09:56.637 --> 10:00.392
wheel firmly at 10:00 and 2:00..

10:00.434 --> 10:02.519
'That's 11:00 and 1:00,

10:00.434 --> 10:02.519
10:00 and 2:00.'

10:02.561 --> 10:04.896
'Okay, put your foot

10:02.561 --> 10:04.896
on the brake'

10:04.938 --> 10:07.566
'and carefully

10:04.938 --> 10:07.566
put the car into drive.'

10:10.026 --> 10:14.197
Okay now, slowly and gently,

10:10.026 --> 10:14.197
take your foot off of the brake

10:14.239 --> 10:19.619
and put it on to the accelerator

10:14.239 --> 10:19.619
pressing ever so lightly.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.497
[shouting]

10:19.660 --> 10:22.497
Ever so lightly!

10:19.660 --> 10:22.497
Put it in park! Put it in park!

10:22.539 --> 10:24.832
Ugh, dad,

10:22.539 --> 10:24.832
you're making me so tense.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.834
Tense is good.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.834
It will keep you alert.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.630
Okay, okay, okay, I-I'm sorry.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.630
Let's just start over again.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.466
Hands at 10:00 and 2:00.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.883
'Foot on the brake.'

10:33.925 --> 10:35.385
'Put the car into drive.'

10:35.427 --> 10:38.597
This time, keep your foot

10:35.427 --> 10:38.597
off of the gas pedal.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.309
Let's just master the fine art

10:38.638 --> 10:42.309
of riding the brake, okay?

10:44.685 --> 10:46.480
Oh, this is nice.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.815
There's no need

10:46.521 --> 10:48.815
to be a speed demon.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.026
Dad, I think a snail

10:48.856 --> 10:52.026
just passed us.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.903
Wait, stop! Stop!

10:53.945 --> 10:56.030
Ugh, now what?

10:56.072 --> 10:59.075
You're heading straight

10:56.072 --> 10:59.075
for that tree. Don't you see it?

10:59.117 --> 11:01.661
You can't mean that tree

10:59.117 --> 11:01.661
on the other end of the lot?

11:01.702 --> 11:03.330
Dad, I'm nowhere near it.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.374
I didn't say you were near it.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.374
I asked if you saw it.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.792
D.J., you are never

11:06.416 --> 11:07.792
gonna learn to drive

11:07.834 --> 11:09.043
if you don't listen to me.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.170
Well, I'm never

11:09.085 --> 11:10.170
gonna learn because

11:10.211 --> 11:11.630
you don't want me to learn.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.256
Oh, okay.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.256
Okay, that's it.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.133
You are way too emotional

11:13.298 --> 11:15.133
to be in the driver's seat.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.510
Switch places.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.510
Out of the car.

11:16.551 --> 11:17.511
- Fine.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.513
- Fine. Fine.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.513
- Fine.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.222
- Fine.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.307
- Fine.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.309
- Fine.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.309
- Pfft.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.941
What are you doing back there?

11:31.983 --> 11:34.027
Well, I'm really not in the mood

11:31.983 --> 11:34.027
to sit next to you.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.363
You don't trust me.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.363
You don't want me to drive.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.407
You don't wanna help me,

11:36.404 --> 11:39.407
so please just leave me alone.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.951
This went well.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.289
[instrumental music]

11:54.548 --> 11:57.467
Okay, Jess, all ready.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.467
Bring in the boys.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.641
Cheese!

12:06.434 --> 12:09.437
What have you done

12:06.434 --> 12:09.437
to my babies?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.022
I took 'em down

12:09.479 --> 12:11.022
to the Harley shop.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.816
They opened a new department,

12:11.064 --> 12:13.816
Tykes On Bikes.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.487
[chuckles]

12:15.318 --> 12:17.487
What's that on your heads?

12:17.529 --> 12:21.366
Do-rags.

12:17.529 --> 12:21.366
Nice touch, huh?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.660
- Do-rags?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.660
- Mm-hm.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.828
Well, my mother's

12:23.702 --> 12:25.828
gonna love this picture.

12:25.870 --> 12:29.541
Honey, I don't want everyone

12:25.870 --> 12:29.541
knowing my kids are baldies.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.626
Sweetheart,

12:29.583 --> 12:31.626
lots of babies are bald.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.128
Not me, when I was born,

12:31.668 --> 12:34.128
the doctor smacked my butt

12:34.170 --> 12:36.923
and gave me a blow dryer.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.383
That figures.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.052
Well, you know,

12:38.425 --> 12:41.052
I have to admit.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.722
'You guys do look awfully cute.'

12:43.762 --> 12:46.516
Okay, smile.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.976
Come here, pumpkin pie.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.896
Alright, Nicky,

12:49.018 --> 12:51.896
give me that Elvis lip.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.818
[sighing]

12:55.525 --> 12:57.818
Sorry, mom.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.032
- How did the driving lesson go?

13:00.530 --> 13:03.032
- Ask him.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.368
She's got a serious

13:03.074 --> 13:05.368
attitude problem.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.746
Me? He was screaming

13:05.410 --> 13:07.746
at me like a maniac.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.539
Excuse me,

13:07.786 --> 13:09.539
but that's a natural reaction

13:09.581 --> 13:11.625
when somebody's hot-rodding.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.918
I better go take care of this.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.795
Okay, fellas.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.424
Now that he's gone,

13:16.837 --> 13:19.424
what do you say we play a game?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.509
Hide the do-rags.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.554
Let me tell you something,

13:22.801 --> 13:24.554
police officers

13:24.596 --> 13:27.724
have pulled me over

13:24.596 --> 13:27.724
just to compliment my driving.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.392
I bet they were on foot.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.311
Alright, Danny,

13:29.434 --> 13:31.311
lighten up now.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.896
You know, teaching someone to

13:31.352 --> 13:33.896
drive, that should be fun thing.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.065
- You really think so?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.065
- Absolutely.

13:36.107 --> 13:39.319
Oh, thanks, Uncle Jesse.

13:36.107 --> 13:39.319
This is gonna be so fun.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.613
Me? I-I-I, you want me

13:39.360 --> 13:41.613
to teach you to drive?

13:41.655 --> 13:43.197
Yeah. Who better?

13:43.239 --> 13:47.034
You know everything about cars.

13:43.239 --> 13:47.034
You're the road warrior.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.663
Yeah. Guess I am, huh?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.830
Well, it's fine with me

13:49.704 --> 13:51.830
if it's okay with your dad.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.418
- Uh, is it okay, dad?

13:51.872 --> 13:55.418
- I don't know, Deej.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.754
You, you really wanna

13:55.460 --> 13:57.754
learn to drive

13:57.796 --> 14:00.590
from a guy

13:57.796 --> 14:00.590
who's dressed like a pirate?

14:00.632 --> 14:03.176
It's a do-rag.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.176
It's gone, okay?

14:03.217 --> 14:05.052
Now, you can trust me.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.052
I'm a father now.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.472
But, you know, if you wanna

14:05.094 --> 14:07.472
take her out again yourself--

14:07.514 --> 14:10.016
No, no, no, no.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.016
I-I-I trust you. I trust you.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.309
Oh, thanks, dad.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.812
You just be very,

14:11.351 --> 14:13.812
very careful, okay?

14:13.852 --> 14:17.231
Alright. Now, Deej,

14:13.852 --> 14:17.231
what have you learned so far?

14:17.273 --> 14:21.653
Uh, how to secure the litter bag

14:17.273 --> 14:21.653
and check for cattle.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.822
Oh, good, well, if a cow has

14:21.695 --> 14:23.822
to throw away a gum wrapper

14:23.863 --> 14:25.490
you'll be ready.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.661
Hello. Yeah.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.661
Governor Wilson's office?

14:29.703 --> 14:32.288
Yes, hi. Danny Tanner here,

14:29.703 --> 14:32.288
concerned citizen.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.998
Yeah, I-I was just wondering

14:32.330 --> 14:33.998
is there any way

14:34.040 --> 14:37.627
we can raise

14:34.040 --> 14:37.627
the driving age to 35?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.879
Check it out,

14:37.669 --> 14:39.879
"Doogie Howser reveals

14:39.920 --> 14:41.922
his most intimate secrets."

14:41.964 --> 14:45.259
"Doogie likes tuna fish

14:41.964 --> 14:45.259
and music."

14:45.301 --> 14:47.554
Boy, he really spilled his guts.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.850
Guess what.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.850
I'm a cheerleader.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.476
Not now, Michelle.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.812
Give me a A.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.812
Give me a B.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.397
Give me a C.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.397
Give me a D--

14:57.438 --> 15:00.316
Give me an O-U-T!

14:57.438 --> 15:00.316
Out! Out!

15:00.358 --> 15:03.277
Way out!

15:03.319 --> 15:06.280
This is my room too.

15:06.322 --> 15:13.079
Okay, I guess I'm gonna have to

15:06.322 --> 15:13.079
call the hairy, scary monster.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.790
Oops. I said his name once.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.209
I'm not scared.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.086
Oh, really?

15:20.127 --> 15:24.173
Hairy, scary monster.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.675
That's two.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.010
I'm still not scared.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.222
You will be.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.308
Hairy, scary..

15:34.350 --> 15:38.187
- Run, Michelle, run.

15:34.350 --> 15:38.187
- I don't think so.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.024
Okay, you asked for it.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.777
...monster!

15:46.863 --> 15:50.366
Well, well, well.

15:46.863 --> 15:50.366
Look who's<i> not</i> here.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.454
Okay, there is no monster.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.123
But, uh, get out anyway.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.625
[growling]

15:58.666 --> 16:00.585
[screaming]

16:00.627 --> 16:02.420
Thank you, Joey.

You're very welcome,

16:06.716 --> 16:09.260
Joey, we knew it was you

16:06.716 --> 16:09.260
all along, right, Rita?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.053
Heck, no!

16:11.095 --> 16:12.430
Okay.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.349
Now, look, you guys

16:12.472 --> 16:15.349
are all even now, okay?

16:15.391 --> 16:17.769
So, let's call a little truce.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.562
Steph, no more scaring Michelle.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.439
Michelle, when Stephanie's

16:19.604 --> 16:21.439
in here with her friends

16:21.481 --> 16:22.774
you gotta give her some space.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.442
- Deal?

16:22.816 --> 16:24.442
- Deal.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.736
Okay. Here, put this on,

16:24.484 --> 16:26.736
Michelle.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.905
And let's all howl on it.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.625

16:46.840 --> 16:50.551

16:50.593 --> 16:52.720
Alright, go ahead.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.720

16:52.762 --> 16:55.765

16:55.807 --> 17:01.145
D.J., driving should be a very

16:55.807 --> 17:01.145
calm, cool, soothing experience.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.773
Now turn the key

17:01.187 --> 17:03.773

17:15.242 --> 17:17.411
- Yeah.

Oh, Uncle Jesse,

17:21.207 --> 17:23.292

17:23.334 --> 17:26.963
I know. It's just something

17:23.334 --> 17:26.963
I've learned to live with.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.173
Alright, now,

17:27.005 --> 17:29.173
before you put it into drive

17:29.215 --> 17:32.092
I want you to, I want you

17:29.215 --> 17:32.092

17:32.134 --> 17:33.678
Listen to Sally.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.262
That way, you become the car

17:35.304 --> 17:37.515

17:35.304 --> 17:37.515
the car becomes..

Oh, everything was fine.

Oh, thank God.

Except for the accident.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.464

19:33.506 --> 19:35.925
excellent public

19:33.506 --> 19:35.925

19:39.720 --> 19:41.430
you're saying this.

You sound just like dad.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.019
I passed the test.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.019
I got my learner's permit.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.687
It was amazing.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.313
I took home the manual.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.273
I read the stuff inside.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.192
And then when I took the test

19:53.233 --> 19:55.611
I remembered the stuff

19:53.233 --> 19:55.611
that I read.

19:59.073 --> 20:03.285
- You mean you studied.

19:59.073 --> 20:03.285
- Is that what I did? Wow!

For the first time in my life,

20:16.423 --> 20:19.343
I wish I was a Gibbler.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.181
All I wanna do

20:20.845 --> 20:23.181
is be able to drive a car

20:23.222 --> 20:25.474
like everybody else in America.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.601
Why are you guys

20:25.516 --> 20:27.601
making this so hard for me?

20:27.643 --> 20:31.313
Sweetheart, I know I've been

20:27.643 --> 20:31.313

20:31.355 --> 20:33.066
...for the last 15 years,

20:31.355 --> 20:33.066
all I've been doin'

20:33.107 --> 20:34.567
is tryin' to protect you.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.069
When you learned to walk,

20:34.608 --> 20:36.069
I covered

20:36.110 --> 20:38.445

20:44.702 --> 20:46.453
ever happened to you

20:46.495 --> 20:48.581
I-I don't know what I'd do.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.291
Dad, don't worry.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.291
Nothing is gonna happen to me.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.544
How do you know that? There's

20:51.333 --> 20:53.544

20:53.586 --> 20:56.714

20:53.586 --> 20:56.714

20:56.756 --> 20:58.465
Deej, listen, I know how

20:56.756 --> 20:58.465
you feel but, you know

20:58.507 --> 21:01.301
I'm a father now too, and so

20:58.507 --> 21:01.301
I know how your dad feels.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.720
I mean, since the day

21:01.343 --> 21:02.720
my kids were born

21:02.762 --> 21:04.805
I haven't stopped

21:02.762 --> 21:04.805

21:04.847 --> 21:07.349
Well, it's really nice that you

21:04.847 --> 21:07.349
guys are really worried about me

21:07.391 --> 21:10.394
but what am I supposed to do?

21:07.391 --> 21:10.394
Ride a bike the rest of my life?

21:10.436 --> 21:13.313
Of course not.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.313
How about a horse?

21:14.732 --> 21:17.735
Dad, you have to let go.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.196
I know, I-I have a hard time

21:17.777 --> 21:20.196

21:20.238 --> 21:23.783

21:23.824 --> 21:27.411

21:27.453 --> 21:30.164
Somebody's gotta teach her.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.126
It's either us,

21:30.206 --> 21:33.126
or Mr. Gibbler.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.044
I vote for us.

Thanks, dad.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.383
- Thanks, Uncle Jesse.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.383
- Alright.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.677
And this time,

21:41.425 --> 21:43.677
I'll try not to be so tense.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.305
Right, and I'll try not

21:43.719 --> 21:46.305
to be so laid back.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.099
Thanks, guys.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.099
Well, let's get out there.

- Okay, fine. We'll take yours.

21:58.276 --> 22:00.319
- Alright.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.202
- Okay, you guys ready?

22:06.284 --> 22:08.202
- Oh, yeah.

Yeah. We're cool and calm,

- Oh, now I'm paranoid.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.809
