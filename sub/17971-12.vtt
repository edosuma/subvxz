Hey, the restroom
is right here!

00:35.703 --> 00:38.737
Some skank is having a
baby in there, man.

00:38.739 --> 00:39.638
Oh.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.140
Congratulations!
(baby cries)

00:41.142 --> 00:42.241
GIRL:
Thank you!

00:42.243 --> 00:46.311
Mm, babies making babies.

00:48.248 --> 00:49.782
Aah! Fructose!

00:49.784 --> 00:52.651
Damn, this school is
more out of control

00:52.653 --> 00:54.753
than Amy Winehouse's hair.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.189
(clock ticking)

00:57.191 --> 00:59.224
Where have you been?

00:59.226 --> 01:01.360
It's 4:00 a.m.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.228
Get off my back!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.296
I hate you!

01:04.298 --> 01:05.697
I hate this house!

01:05.699 --> 01:08.167
I hate my life!

01:09.636 --> 01:11.470
I don't really
hate you.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.305
I know, love.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.674
Come to mama.

01:16.876 --> 01:19.244
There, there, baby.

01:19.246 --> 01:22.147
Now where is my head hair?

01:24.884 --> 01:26.485
"Teabag City?!"

01:26.487 --> 01:30.355
More like T-rouble City
for whoever did this.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.425
(fire alarm ringing,
screaming, clamoring)

01:33.427 --> 01:34.960
Remain calm.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.228
It's a prank.

01:36.230 --> 01:39.264
Football team, remain calm.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.433
(screams, groans)

01:41.901 --> 01:44.536
Marching band, remain calm.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.938
(playing march)

01:45.940 --> 01:47.039
(screams, groans)

01:47.041 --> 01:51.376
Cast of this season's
<i>Biggest Loser,</i> sremain calm.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.712
(screams, groans)

01:56.449 --> 01:58.584
(groans)

02:00.720 --> 02:01.820
(wheels squeaking)

02:01.822 --> 02:05.257
(over speaker):
This is Principal Farquhar.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.192
Good afternoon,
concerned parents,

02:07.194 --> 02:09.094
teachers and local busybodies.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.029
I'm speaking to you
from the Our Lady

02:11.031 --> 02:14.900
of Our Lord Jesus Christ
Hospital's trample ward.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.768
To end the anarchy
at our school,

02:16.770 --> 02:21.406
I've gathered the nine worst
punks at Stoolbend High.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.275
E.L. Fudge, Wowzer,

02:23.277 --> 02:26.011
A.K. Rocka, Lazy Eye,

02:26.013 --> 02:28.080
Fontasia, Big Skeeze,

02:28.082 --> 02:31.350
Hole Punch, P. Hound,
and Nazi Greg.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.685
Uh, Nazi Greg's grandma died.
He not here.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.053
(over speaker):
Sorry to hear that.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.923
Donna, write a condolence card
to Nazi Greg.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.525
Now, as for the rest of you,

02:39.527 --> 02:42.094
I can't pin anything
on you specifically,

02:42.096 --> 02:44.630
but by the power
of the Farquhar Doctrine,

02:44.632 --> 02:47.866
I can preemptively
expel all of you.

02:47.868 --> 02:48.734
(murmuring)

02:48.736 --> 02:50.235
This is fascist, man!

02:50.237 --> 02:51.403
Go back to Woodstock!

02:51.405 --> 02:53.939
In my day, you could buy candy
for a nickel.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.040
(all clamoring)

02:55.042 --> 02:57.309
(thumping)

02:57.311 --> 02:58.977
What we have here

02:58.979 --> 03:02.514
is a failure to communicate.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.682
Cleveland Brown?

03:03.684 --> 03:04.950
What are you doing there?!

03:04.952 --> 03:06.885
CLEVELAND:
It's Coach Brown, Wally.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.421
And what I'm doing
is realizing

03:09.423 --> 03:11.657
that those who can, coach,

03:11.659 --> 03:13.492
and those who can't, teach.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.628
And it's time for this coach
to teach these teachers

03:16.630 --> 03:19.631
how to coach these students
to teach themselves

03:19.633 --> 03:22.067
how to coach one another
while teaching us all...

03:22.069 --> 03:25.270
Aren't there usually chips
at these meetings?

03:25.272 --> 03:25.938
Don't you see?!

03:25.940 --> 03:28.574
All these kids need is
a sit-down with a grown-up

03:28.576 --> 03:30.742
who can give them
the tough love they need.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.512
Someone as wild and
unconventional as they are,

03:33.514 --> 03:37.649
with his outrageous behavior
and shocking gutter talk.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.284
Doggone it!

03:39.286 --> 03:39.985
Seems fine.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.654
Doesn't seem to have any
dents in it or anything.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.691
The point is, these
kids need a hero.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.626
Oh, no, one of the
bolts came out

03:47.628 --> 03:50.596
where the seat adheres to
the back support leg.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.364
What about you,
Coach Brown?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.666
(crowd murmurs)
Well, he did
break a chair.

03:54.668 --> 03:55.801
Then it's settled.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.170
Coach Brown will
save our school.

03:58.172 --> 04:01.440
Godspeed,
you black emperor.

04:02.842 --> 04:05.344
Whoosh, whush, whash.

04:05.346 --> 04:05.911
Whoosh.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.814
Rallo, Julius' costume
party was a week ago.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.683
What did I tell you about
wearing that filthy thing?

04:11.685 --> 04:13.118
Oh, what'd I tell you?

04:13.120 --> 04:14.853
This ain't a costume.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.122
I... am... Superman!

04:17.124 --> 04:18.757
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop what?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.592
I'm not doing anything.
Get this damn thing...

04:20.594 --> 04:21.960
(grunts)
Rallo.
I'm just standing here

04:21.962 --> 04:23.428
in this position.
Damn, you smell foul.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.730
Why don't you stop.
Fine.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.598
That's right.
Stink all to hell
and get lice and suffer.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.134
Go on, get in the kitchen
and make my dinner.
You stink.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.135
(Rallo laughs)

04:30.137 --> 04:31.937
Okay, guys,
welcome to my home.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.772
If you touch anything,
let me know,

04:33.774 --> 04:36.208
so I can get it
professionally cleaned.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.443
Actually,
let me start over.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.078
Welcome to my home.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.079
Don't touch anything.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.081
Hey, it's that lady
from the school

04:43.083 --> 04:44.583
that has the big ass.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.584
Language!

04:45.586 --> 04:48.320
Hey, it's the lady
from the school

04:48.322 --> 04:50.055
<i>who</i> shas the big ass.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.024
There you go.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.561
Come on, let's boogie on down
for our rap session.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.929
You dig?

05:04.437 --> 05:05.737
(slurping)

05:05.739 --> 05:08.140
Ah, that's good tonic water.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.574
Nobody wants a tonic?

05:09.576 --> 05:09.908
Okay.

05:09.910 --> 05:14.046
Now let's stop being polite
and start getting real.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.048
I know what you kids
are up to.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.183
Drinking beer, drinking whiskey,

05:18.185 --> 05:20.619
peeing in the bed,
puking in the bed,

05:20.621 --> 05:23.188
peeing on your puke,
puking on your pee.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.691
Same bull spit
I used to do.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.627
Whatever you've done,
I've done worse.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.728
Like what?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.630
(inhales)

05:31.632 --> 05:33.198
I shot a kid.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.134
He was 13 years old.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.969
Oh, it was dark.

05:37.971 --> 05:38.970
I couldn't see him.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.807
Had a ray gun,
looked real enough.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.075
You know,
when you're a rookie,

05:43.077 --> 05:46.445
they can teach you everything
about being a cop

05:46.447 --> 05:49.114
except how to live
with a mistake.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.516
Hold up-- isn't that
from <i>Die Hard?</i>

05:51.518 --> 05:52.951
(clears throat)
Yes.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.119
I love that movie!

05:54.121 --> 05:56.188
Me, too, <i>ese!</i>
<i>It's sick.</i>

05:56.190 --> 05:57.289
You seen <i>Bird On A Wire?</i>

05:57.291 --> 05:59.825
You know, you kind of look like
the black guy in <i>Die Hard.</i>

05:59.827 --> 06:02.561
Hold up-- <i>weres</i> you the
black guy in D <i>ie Hard?</i>

06:02.563 --> 06:03.628
Yes.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.031
(all cheering)

06:06.033 --> 06:07.132
I got something to say.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.134
♪ Bob-ba-bah-bob,
a-dang, a-dang, dang ♪

06:09.136 --> 06:11.803
♪ A ding-a-dong-ding,
you're cool. ♪

06:11.805 --> 06:14.539
(all cheering)

06:14.541 --> 06:15.207
There we go.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.076
Now, doesn't friendship
feel nice?

06:18.078 --> 06:19.911
Mm, it feels nice to me.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.614
Hey, the eight of you
could form a club.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.584
You could call yourselves
"The Eight Positive Teens

06:25.586 --> 06:29.488
Who Are Making A Difference
In Their Community."

06:29.490 --> 06:31.790
Or EPTWAMADITC.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.492
How about the
Crazy Eights?

06:33.494 --> 06:34.960
Yeah!
Crazy Eights!

06:34.962 --> 06:36.762
That's tight!
(all cheering)

06:36.764 --> 06:39.197
Hooray for Cleveland,
our leader!

06:39.199 --> 06:41.099
(chuckles)

06:41.868 --> 06:45.570
Yo, Eights, let me
holler at you.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.571
I been around.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.207
Seen a lot of things.
Know a lot of things.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.143
But you know
what I don't know?

06:51.145 --> 06:54.146
I don't know what to do
with all these jackets!

06:54.148 --> 06:56.281
(laughs)
Here! Put 'em on!

06:56.283 --> 06:58.283
(all cheering)

06:58.285 --> 06:59.718
But these
aren't gifts.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.586
They're an investment
in your future.

07:01.588 --> 07:05.023
Which will be nothing without
a real-world skill.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.692
So, today, we're going
into business.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.796
But we don't know nothing
about business, homes.

07:10.798 --> 07:11.363
But I do.

07:11.365 --> 07:12.664
We're going to sell
a product

07:12.666 --> 07:14.633
that can't people can't
live without.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.902
CLEVELAND JR.:
How about cookies?

07:16.904 --> 07:18.203
Junior, what are you
doing here?

07:18.205 --> 07:22.140
I'm kind of a troubled teen,
too, if you think about it.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.242
Junior's a legacy.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.744
He's in.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.745
And cookies it is!

07:26.747 --> 07:29.481
We're going to be
a cookie-selling operation!

07:29.483 --> 07:32.851
How are we supposed to make
money selling cookies, huh?

07:32.853 --> 07:33.718
Easy.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.187
Some of you will put
the goods together,

07:35.189 --> 07:37.722
and if you don't have enough
to make a full batch,

07:37.724 --> 07:39.825
just cut in some
extra baking powder.

07:39.827 --> 07:40.892
No one's going to notice.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.894
And some of you will handle
the distribution.

07:42.896 --> 07:46.198
Street corners and bad
neighborhoods are great places

07:46.200 --> 07:47.332
to push your product.

07:47.334 --> 07:50.202
Give poor people something
to live for.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.803
And here's a little tip.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.772
The first one's
always free.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.841
'Cause once you
get 'em hooked,

07:55.843 --> 07:58.610
they're customers for life.

07:59.378 --> 08:02.247
I know some people who are
straight-up junkies.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.949
For cookies.
We all do.

08:03.951 --> 08:08.320
Hey, I got a cousin in Columbia
who got tons of powder.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.088
I mean, baking powder.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.356
Call him.
And we can learn everything

08:11.358 --> 08:14.593
we need to know on the Internet
about cooking up a batch.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.627
Of cookies.

08:15.629 --> 08:19.231
Yeah, the Internet has
a "plethoras" of information.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.132
I love a sugar high!

08:21.134 --> 08:22.667
Everybody does!

08:22.669 --> 08:24.169
Whoo! I'm gonna be

08:24.171 --> 08:27.739
the cookie kingpin
of Stoolbend!

08:28.674 --> 08:30.041
Seems fine.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.142
Oh, it's cracked.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.677
Let's get the hell
out of here.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.581
I definitely don't want
to get in no trouble!

08:46.993 --> 08:47.993
Hey, gang!

08:47.995 --> 08:49.728
<i>Orale, jefe.</i>

08:49.962 --> 08:51.863
Hey, Super Smurf,
where you going?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.298
The fortress
of solitude.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.600
Otherwise known
as the crapper.

08:55.602 --> 08:56.801
(chuckles)

08:56.803 --> 08:58.236
I'm going to use
that one.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.304
Hey, check it
out, homes.

08:59.306 --> 09:02.007
Here's your
cut, dawg.
Thank you!

09:02.009 --> 09:04.743
What's on the menu
today, son?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.378
Snickerdoodles.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.280
Snicker, please.

09:08.282 --> 09:09.314
(moans)

09:09.316 --> 09:10.849
Cleveland, it's great
what you've done

09:10.851 --> 09:13.518
for these kids, and Lord
knows we need the extra cash,

09:13.520 --> 09:16.955
but do you find all this
a bit suspicious?

09:18.357 --> 09:20.458
Junior's the only one
making cookies,

09:20.460 --> 09:22.694
and you and the kids
eat most of them,

09:22.696 --> 09:25.230
but the club brings in a
thousand dollars a day.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.998
Hmm. Hadn't thought
about it.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.701
I guess I was too busy
thinking about

09:29.703 --> 09:33.271
our new flat-screen TV!

09:33.273 --> 09:35.340
(screams, giggles)

09:35.342 --> 09:38.009
Oh, I love
you, baby!

09:38.011 --> 09:39.177
Ooh! Ooh!
Yes, Donna,

09:39.179 --> 09:41.112
I'm making the world
a little better.

09:41.114 --> 09:45.750
I haven't felt this good since
I helped that homeless person.

09:50.022 --> 09:52.357
Pay it forward, stinky.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.925
Whew!

09:54.660 --> 09:56.861
Hey, I need to get some cash
for the weekend.

09:56.863 --> 09:57.929
Hang a left.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.199
Some of my kids
are out selling.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.204
(car alarm wailing)

10:10.743 --> 10:12.110
Yo, A.K.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.380
What you got
for me today?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.681
This feels light.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.783
Yeah, well, you know.

10:18.785 --> 10:19.985
No, I don't know.

10:19.987 --> 10:20.919
What's up, A.K.?

10:20.921 --> 10:23.088
Nutty Buddies ain't
selling today?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.422
People love
Nutty Buddies.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.358
Look at me when I'm
talking to you!

10:26.360 --> 10:27.559
You holding out on me?

10:27.561 --> 10:30.395
I look like Nintendo?
That why you playing me?

10:30.397 --> 10:32.030
Huh?
All right, listen.

10:32.032 --> 10:32.998
There's another club

10:33.000 --> 10:35.767
down on Avenue 49
called the Stoolbloods,

10:35.769 --> 10:37.702
and they sell
"cookies," too.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.038
And they weren't too cool
with us selling "cookies"

10:40.040 --> 10:40.739
on their corner,

10:40.741 --> 10:43.742
so they stole our supplies
and our money.

10:43.744 --> 10:44.876
How many times I tell you,

10:44.878 --> 10:48.680
never keep the money
and the supplies together!

10:48.682 --> 10:49.681
(groans)

10:49.683 --> 10:52.117
Avenue 49, huh?

10:52.119 --> 10:53.284
Go!

10:53.286 --> 10:54.552
Go what?

10:54.554 --> 10:56.187
Go... please.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.690
There you go.
(engine starts)

11:02.762 --> 11:04.095
(brakes squeal)

11:04.097 --> 11:06.498
(Cleveland groans)

11:12.071 --> 11:15.073
(pounding on door)

11:18.678 --> 11:20.812
Good evening, (bleep).

11:20.814 --> 11:22.247
Who the hell are you?

11:22.249 --> 11:24.816
Cleveland (bleep) Brown,

11:24.818 --> 11:26.451
(bleep).

11:26.453 --> 11:29.054
Oh, did I interrupt you
cooking up a batch

11:29.056 --> 11:30.689
with our baking soda?

11:30.691 --> 11:34.192
Gonna crack a few eggs
in there, cup a brown sugar,

11:34.194 --> 11:38.697
teaspoon of vanilla extract,
walnuts to taste?

11:38.699 --> 11:41.132
(thuds)
Hold up.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.769
His nonsensical ramblings
have piqued my interest.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.404
Please continue.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.340
I am the leader
of the Crazy Eights,

11:49.342 --> 11:51.476
and if you come near
my kids again,

11:51.478 --> 11:54.312
or even think
of selling on our corner,

11:54.314 --> 11:56.381
I will wait
for the first snow of winter,

11:56.383 --> 12:00.385
so I may spell my name
when I whiz on your grave.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.888
Dad, are we still going
to Williams-Sonoma?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.791
In a minute.
Wait in the car.

12:06.793 --> 12:07.592
Good kid.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.727
Wish he'd lose the apron.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.695
Looks like
Clay Aiken's sex bib.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.597
You know, the Clay
Aiken Christmas CD

12:12.599 --> 12:13.798
is actually
pretty good.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.334
Can't hold a Christmas candle
to David Archuleta.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.203
What'd I tell you
about David Archuleta?

12:18.205 --> 12:21.673
You know how much money
I lost on David Archuleta?

12:21.675 --> 12:22.574
Sorry, Mob Stabber.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.343
I thought you made it back
on Christian Siriano.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.846
Not all of it.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.387
No, you listen to me.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.691
I ordered a big old
concrete lawn goose,

12:39.693 --> 12:41.826
and I want it
here tonight.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.728
Somebody order a goose?

12:43.730 --> 12:45.530
(doorbell rings)

12:45.532 --> 12:47.132
Good Morgan.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.466
S'up?
<i>Yo. Sí.</i>

12:48.468 --> 12:51.536
Hey, did somebody
lose this?

12:52.371 --> 12:53.471
How'd you get that?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.273
I simply let
the Stoolbloods know

12:55.275 --> 12:58.777
they chose the wrong Negro
to futz with.

12:58.779 --> 12:59.511
Hey, C-Bro,

12:59.513 --> 13:01.045
there's a few things
we got to tell you.

13:01.047 --> 13:05.283
Always got time
to conversate
with my homies.

13:07.486 --> 13:09.888
Okay, gang, what's
the good word?

13:09.890 --> 13:13.858
What you believe to be a bag
of flour and sugar is not.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.361
It's cocaine.
Mm-hmm.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.629
And heroin.
Mm-hmm.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.265
'Cause we don't sell cookies.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.499
We sell drugs.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.267
Okay.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.468
Out of your house.
Okay.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.804
Which kind of makes you
a gang leader.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.639
Mm-hmm.
And you just stole

13:27.641 --> 13:29.774
about $10,000 worth
of narcotics

13:29.776 --> 13:31.910
from the most
vicious gang in town.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.878
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Which means

13:33.880 --> 13:37.782
they're gunning
for your ass right now.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.318
I see.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.757
(shrieking)

13:45.759 --> 13:47.926
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!

13:47.928 --> 13:48.960
(shrieking)

13:48.962 --> 13:52.630
I accused them
of fornicating
their own mothers.

13:52.632 --> 13:53.631
They're tough.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.999
I've only been
acting tough.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.568
Got to dump the coke.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.069
(hyperventilating):
Why...

13:58.071 --> 14:03.474
is... this...
hap...pen... ing... to... me?!

14:03.476 --> 14:04.275
Okay, okay.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.510
Oh, flush, flush, flush,

14:05.512 --> 14:08.880
(toilet flushing)
flush, flush, flush, flush.

14:08.882 --> 14:09.948
(flushing)

14:09.950 --> 14:11.549
Okay, go away.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.784
Bye-bye,
no more problems.

14:12.786 --> 14:14.886
All right, thank you.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.724
Okay, there's
no evidence now.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.759
We'll just lay low
for a while.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.729
How bad can these
Stoolbloods really be?

14:24.731 --> 14:25.830
(cell phone ringing)

14:25.832 --> 14:27.398
Hold up.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.600
Yello?

14:28.602 --> 14:31.035
We got your son.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.004
They've got Junior.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.038
(screams)

14:34.040 --> 14:35.240
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God!

14:35.242 --> 14:38.810
You want him alive,
you bring back our merchandise.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.712
Well, how long
have I got?

14:40.714 --> 14:42.847
Well, what time
is it now, 11:41?

14:42.849 --> 14:47.051
So, I'm gonna say,
uh, <i>11:51.</i>

14:47.053 --> 14:48.019
Ten minutes?!

14:48.021 --> 14:48.987
(dial tone)

14:48.989 --> 14:51.623
I think I speak for
all of us when I say,

14:51.625 --> 14:54.125
I am so sorry about
the death of your son.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.261
Thank you.
This has been a difficult--

14:56.263 --> 14:57.896
Hey, Junior is not dead!

14:57.898 --> 15:01.833
I am going to save
my son!

15:03.936 --> 15:06.738
CLEVELAND:
He's not dead yet!

15:12.745 --> 15:16.080
All right, anyone else
need to use the bathroom?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.448
(kids grunt)
Good.

15:17.450 --> 15:21.386
Now we've only got eight minutes
left to save Junior!

15:21.388 --> 15:22.587
Come on!

15:26.059 --> 15:27.525
Let's go!

15:27.527 --> 15:29.861
We're scared, okay?
We're high school kids, man.

15:29.863 --> 15:31.963
We didn't want
to get in this deep.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.464
I don't want to die.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.800
I got six children
of my own, homes.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.101
Come here.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.771

15:39.773 --> 15:42.807
Who was always there with
a smile and a glass of milk?

15:42.809 --> 15:46.044
Whose idea was it to sell
cookies in the first place,

15:46.046 --> 15:48.513
which covered up
your whole damn racket?

How'd you get here?

that y'all had the coke in

before you flushed it
down the toilet.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.584
I-I didn't...

17:33.586 --> 17:35.787
I don't even own a toilet.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.023

18:12.025 --> 18:13.224
C-Bro's the only person

18:13.226 --> 18:15.760
who ever cared about us kids,
and we blew it.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.162
I was gonna sell a few grams
on the side,

18:18.164 --> 18:20.198
but this stuff is nothing
but trouble.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.099
You can have it.

18:21.101 --> 18:24.969
I know it ain't much,
but let him go.

18:25.637 --> 18:26.804
For a dime bag?

18:26.806 --> 18:29.073
I don't think so, punk.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.208
Yo, I got a bag
of meth.

18:30.210 --> 18:34.045
I'll bust out the sticky icky
for my boy Cleveland.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.081
I got Chinese opium
my moms gave me.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.117
Here's a big old bag
of stinkweed.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.487
Fudge got PCP

To sir, with love.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.696
They are our future.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.064
BRODERICK:
Cleveland, it's me.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.365
CLEVELAND:
My brother Broderick?!

18:54.367 --> 18:57.135
I thought you were shipped off
to the Middle East.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.370
I was, but I heard
you were in trouble,

18:59.372 --> 19:00.872
so I raided
a Blackwater operative

19:00.874 --> 19:04.976
and stole his 250 pounds
of Afghani heroin--

19:04.978 --> 19:08.045
the best heroin
in the world.

19:11.383 --> 19:15.119
I'm the richest man
in Stoolbend.

19:15.121 --> 19:18.456
Don't ever let me see
your face again.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.258
Sir, I shall avoid you

19:20.260 --> 19:22.493
like Nicole Kidman
avoids things

19:22.495 --> 19:25.163
that will make her laugh.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.632
(farts)

19:27.634 --> 19:29.333
(stifled giggle)

19:29.335 --> 19:31.335
(laughs)

19:33.038 --> 19:35.306
(guffaws)

19:36.775 --> 19:39.544
Guess I'll drop you
kids off at home.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.312
Actually, you can
drop me off at the mall.

19:41.314 --> 19:44.182
I'm gonna see if I can
get a job folding sweaters.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.317
My cousin's a
non-union electrician.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.419
Maybe I can get
a job with him.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.821
Word.
Gang life sucks.

19:50.823 --> 19:51.956
I heard
that.
Yup.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.491
I'm gonna <i>keep</i>
<i>my next baby.</i>

19:53.493 --> 19:56.093
Well, I hope you kids
learned your lesson.

19:56.095 --> 19:59.297
And that lesson is,
do not come near me

19:59.299 --> 20:00.765
or my family,

20:00.767 --> 20:05.036
or I will rip each
one of you a new anus.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.304
(tires screech)

20:07.272 --> 20:08.773
(tires screech)

20:08.775 --> 20:11.776
I found two large on the floor
at that warehouse.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.345
Hmm. Well, I guess
we could use a thousand

20:14.347 --> 20:16.380
to repair the living
room ceiling.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.050
What if Rallo and I
split the other thousand

20:19.052 --> 20:20.418
in exchange
for never telling Donna

20:20.420 --> 20:24.055
about your impossibly
poor judgment and bad parenting?

20:24.057 --> 20:25.223
I could do that.

20:25.225 --> 20:28.125
I want to spend my $500
at Burger Boy.

20:28.127 --> 20:28.526
Could we stop?

20:28.528 --> 20:32.363
Ha! I hope you kids learned
something today, too.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.365
About drugs,
which are bad.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.367
Except for the ones
which aren't,

20:36.369 --> 20:38.302
like ibuprofen and aspirin.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.271
Marijuana is also okay

20:40.273 --> 20:42.406
if it's legally prescribed
by a doctor

20:42.408 --> 20:46.210
in any of the 13 states
where such laws apply.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.979
Alaska, California,

20:47.981 --> 20:50.248
Colorado, Hawaii, Maine,

20:50.250 --> 20:52.149
Michigan, Montana, Nevada,

20:52.151 --> 20:54.352
New Mexico, Oregon,
Rhode Island,

20:54.354 --> 20:56.220
Vermont and Washington.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.022
Time for a road trip.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.323
(laughs)

20:59.325 --> 21:01.092
Don't you judge me.

21:01.094 --> 21:04.128
Half of you
are high right now.
