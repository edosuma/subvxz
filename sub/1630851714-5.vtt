APPLAUSE

00:33.760 --> 00:36.480
Hello and welcome to QI.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.080
Whether you like sweet or savoury,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.000
there's something
for everyone tonight,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.560
as we serve up a sensational
selection of Sugar and Spice.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.000
Let's meet some real sweeties.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.720
Sweet as a nut, it's Rose Matafeo.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.600
APPLAUSE

00:50.600 --> 00:52.040
Thank you.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.120
Sweet as pie, it's Alice Levine.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.120
APPLAUSE

00:59.480 --> 01:01.640
Short and sweet,
it's Jason Manford.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.400
APPLAUSE

01:01.640 --> 01:03.400
I'll take that, that's fine.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.240
And you can bet your sweet ass
it's Alan Davies.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.760
APPLAUSE

01:13.000 --> 01:17.760
Let's see if their buzzers are sweet
or spicy. Rose goes...

01:17.760 --> 01:21.200
# Sweet home Alabama... #

01:23.440 --> 01:24.760
Alice goes...

01:24.760 --> 01:28.960
# Sweet dreams are made of this... #

01:28.960 --> 01:30.120
Jason goes...

01:30.120 --> 01:33.200
# Sweet Caroline

01:33.200 --> 01:35.120
# Ba-ba-baaa! #

01:35.120 --> 01:37.320
Oh, I just want to carry on.
I like that.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.120
Uh, and Alan goes...

01:39.120 --> 01:40.800
# Colours of the world!
Spice up your life

01:40.800 --> 01:42.960
# Every boy and every girl!
Spice up your life

01:42.960 --> 01:44.880
# People of the world!
Spice up your life

01:44.880 --> 01:46.880
# Ahhhh... #

01:46.880 --> 01:50.040
Oh.
Wow, you all did a dancy thing.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.520
I once did a show...

01:51.520 --> 01:53.560
Is she called Mel B?
I did a show with her.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.280
She is called Mel B. It depends
who you're talking about.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.480
Anyway, it was charming.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.720
What's sticky
and well worth stealing?

02:03.040 --> 02:05.440
A friggin' nice stick. I don't...

02:05.440 --> 02:07.160
Wow.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.800
But, like, a good stick,

02:09.800 --> 02:12.240
like the best stick you've ever
seen, Sandi.

02:12.240 --> 02:15.120
OK, you said "stick", I thought you
said something else entirely.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.320
Wow. Wow! You're not
going to have a...stick.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.960
Stick. A stick. Sorry, I...
Stick! Yeah.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.800
Wait, hang on. I'm having an
identity crisis. No, it's fine.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.480
No, you said stick. Friggin' nice...
Did she say "stick"?

02:25.480 --> 02:28.840
I agree. When, my son,
if we go for a walk,

02:28.840 --> 02:30.720
he finds the best sticks, like,

02:30.720 --> 02:33.240
and he will hold on to that stick
to the point...

02:33.240 --> 02:36.080
My wife won't let them in the house,
because they've been outside,

02:36.080 --> 02:37.880
so he will leave it on the doorstep.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.440
And, the next morning,
when his stick is still there,

02:40.440 --> 02:42.920
it's like the PlayStation 5
has been delivered.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.240
It's like a box to a kitten,
a stick to a kid.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.560
Oh, they love them. Wait till you
get him a toy. I know.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.000
Oh, there's a bloody forest out
there, help yourself, mate.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.760
It's like Toys R Us.
It's a weapon. It's a friend.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.840
It's a companion. Exactly.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.080
I love a stick. Rose knows.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.680
Like a stick, OK. She knows.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.480
I've forgotten what
the question was.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.720
So, sticky and worth stealing?

03:03.720 --> 03:05.760
Jam. Sort of. It's a kind of...

03:05.760 --> 03:07.200
I'm going to say Post-its,

03:07.200 --> 03:09.360
because you don't ever buy that kind
of thing, do you?

03:09.360 --> 03:11.520
You just steal that from work.
Just from the office.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.200
Oh, yeah, that's good. That's
the problem with the work I do.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.240
I never go to an office. Ah, yeah.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.280
No stationery-stealing.
Be a good idea.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.440
What's that?

03:19.440 --> 03:22.320
For a website,
where you could buy some stuff,

03:22.320 --> 03:24.480
but there was a shoplifty corner.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.120
That's such a good idea.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.200
And if you...

03:28.200 --> 03:32.120
if you avoided being detected
by a couple of windows

03:32.120 --> 03:34.360
and you could get into
the shoplifting room,

03:34.360 --> 03:37.280
you could nick a couple of things
and get away with it.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.440
That's such... Let me write
this down. I'm so sorry.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.360
Because the fun of nicking something
is gone at the moment, isn't it?

03:42.360 --> 03:44.120
No-one's nicked anything for ages.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.120
I've never shoplifted in my entire
life, though. Have you shoplifted?

03:47.120 --> 03:48.360
Oh, God, yeah. Really?

03:48.360 --> 03:49.680
I haven't.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.520
Are you kidding? As a schoolboy,
it was an absolute rite of passage.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.960
Oh, my God.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.400
I remember I had friends
who had an aquarium

03:56.400 --> 03:57.960
and they'd go in the pet shop

03:57.960 --> 04:00.200
and just get weeds out of
the fish tank.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.080
I stole a Kinder Egg
when I was about 13.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.240
I felt so guilty that
I actually took it back

04:07.240 --> 04:09.240
the next day and put it back
on the...

04:09.240 --> 04:11.280
Alice, have you shoplifted?

04:11.280 --> 04:13.360
I think you know the answer to this.
Alice...

04:13.360 --> 04:15.200
I'm such a goody two-shoes,
I haven't.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.120
So the three women
have not shoplifted,

04:17.120 --> 04:19.760
I'm just putting it out there.
Rose has committed many crimes.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.160
Yeah, yeah, I've committed fraud.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.840
I've been to jail for fraud,
but that's a clever one.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.000
Were you the person at school who
got other people

04:28.000 --> 04:31.040
to nick stuff for you?
100%. A real racket.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.640
"Go in there and get me something!"

04:32.640 --> 04:35.080
Or if you don't, I'm going to
beat the crap out of you.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.120
Rose went straight for Ponzi
schemes. 100%.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.800
$200 billion Ponzi schemes. 100%.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.000
OK. So, we are
going for something sticky,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
but it's something you
could put on pancakes.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.680
Oh, syrup. Maple syrup?

04:44.680 --> 04:47.320
Maple syrup.
So, over several months,

04:47.320 --> 04:48.880
from 2011 to 2012,

04:48.880 --> 04:53.880
there was a group of thieves
and they stole 3,000 tonnes

04:53.880 --> 04:57.600
of maple syrup from Canada's
global syrup reserves.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.800
I mean, who's not glad that those
exist, right?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.280
Oh, my gosh. It became known -

05:01.280 --> 05:03.920
and I love this title -
The Great Maple Syrup Heist.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.960
Ooh, wow. Good name. I know. Does
what it says on the tin, doesn't it?

05:06.960 --> 05:09.000
"What shall we call it?!"
Incredible.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.760
I feel like there have
been other heists,

05:10.760 --> 05:12.840
but they just stole a sachet or
something, so...

05:12.840 --> 05:14.520
When does it become a heist?

05:14.520 --> 05:16.160
When it's enormously valuable.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.600
This is the most valuable heist
in the whole of Canadian history.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.160
So Canada produces 80%
of the world's maple syrup.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.480
90% of that comes from
Quebec alone.

05:24.480 --> 05:28.880
And they have a strategic reserve
of about 160,000,

05:28.880 --> 05:32.800
or more, barrels,
which are worth $1,800 each,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.280
OK. It's quite a lot of money.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.160
And this is controlled by

05:36.160 --> 05:39.040
a group called The Federation
of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers,

05:39.040 --> 05:41.920
the FPAQ. Great bunch of lads.
I know, such fun at parties.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.040
They sound like a laugh, yeah.
And they keep control of the supply.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.840
And the reserve is only checked
once a year.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.400
So the thieves went into
the place and what they did was

05:49.400 --> 05:51.640
they systematically removed
some barrels,

05:51.640 --> 05:53.720
temporarily replaced them
with empty ones,

05:53.720 --> 05:55.760
syphoned out the syrup,
refilled them with water

05:55.760 --> 05:57.680
and replaced them.
Perfect crime, OK. Yeah.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.360
Because nobody knew until
a syrup inspector...

06:00.360 --> 06:02.560
I mean, the job of dreams, I think.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.040
A syrup inspector
went and had a look,

06:05.040 --> 06:07.320
climbed on a stack of barrels
and nearly fell,

06:07.320 --> 06:09.400
because of the empty ones,
weren't strong enough

06:09.400 --> 06:11.400
to take his weight.
And he raised the alarm

06:11.400 --> 06:15.880
and, in total, 9,000 or more barrels
had been emptied of maple syrup.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.280
Wow. Worth $18 million.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.080
"Ring the alarum bell."

06:20.080 --> 06:23.080
When is Guy Ritchie
going to make that film?

06:23.080 --> 06:27.440
I know. I want to see Jason Statham
doing a Canadian accent.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.680
Yeah. Floating in a tank of syrup.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.560
It's thought, apart from the money,

06:32.560 --> 06:36.000
that the crime was motivated partly
by bad feelings towards the FPAQ,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.320
the people who control...

06:37.320 --> 06:39.560
ALAN GASPS
Yes. And low blood sugar, probably,

06:39.560 --> 06:41.240
because have you ever been hangry?

06:41.240 --> 06:43.440
When I've got a food mood,

06:43.440 --> 06:45.280
I just have to eat there and then.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.840
Like most of these crimes,

06:46.840 --> 06:49.240
there came a point where they should
have just stopped.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.680
Yeah. If we steal any more syrup,
someone's going to notice,

06:52.680 --> 06:54.520
when they climb on the barrels.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.960
Let's stop at a thousand barrels,
what are we like?

06:56.960 --> 06:58.360
Are we greedy people? Yeah. Hm.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.200
What a quote,
"With most crimes,

07:00.200 --> 07:02.440
"there's a point
where you should stop."

07:02.440 --> 07:03.840
Where does maple syrup come from?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.320
Maple tree?

07:05.320 --> 07:06.960
It's called the sugar maple.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.000
Ah.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.720
And Quebec is currently
the world leader.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.120
Isn't nature amazing?

07:11.120 --> 07:12.440
Look at that, they've got...

07:12.440 --> 07:14.640
They grow with a bucket
on the side ready for you.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.040
They're milking trees.
It's like they want you to have it.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.960
Do you not think he looks like
he's in a...

07:18.960 --> 07:21.840
I don't know what he thinks he looks
like. He thinks he's in a catalogue.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.520
"Man from C&A."

07:25.040 --> 07:27.600
I do suddenly want to buy
some overalls for some reason.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.680
Dungarees is the way forward.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.160
It is actually very interesting,

07:31.160 --> 07:33.080
I've been when they tap the sap.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.280
It usually starts running in
about March,

07:35.280 --> 07:37.920
because the warmer temperature
makes pressure inside

07:37.920 --> 07:39.680
the tree increase, so the sap -

07:39.680 --> 07:41.440
which is basically just
sugar and water -

07:41.440 --> 07:43.240
is squeezed -
how can I put this nicely? -

07:43.240 --> 07:45.080
out of any open orifice.

07:45.080 --> 07:48.720
And it takes 40 gallons of the sap
to make one gallon of syrup.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.480
Oh, my gosh. So it's a lot.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.040
But it's not a European invention,

07:52.040 --> 07:53.840
it was made in the Americas
long before

07:53.840 --> 07:55.120
the Europeans turned up,

07:55.120 --> 07:57.840
usually by women from what we call
the First Nation tribes,

07:57.840 --> 08:00.000
who tapped the sap
and then they collected firewood

08:00.000 --> 08:01.840
and boiled the sap to make spirit.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.440
Sounds like a Danny Dyer game show.
It does, yeah. Tap the Sap.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.320
"Ladies and gentlemen,
let's tap the sap."

08:07.320 --> 08:09.160
EAST LONDON ACCENT:
"Tap the sap, come on."

08:09.160 --> 08:10.560
"'Ere comes a bucket."

08:12.960 --> 08:14.640
He doesn't know the rules of it.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.720
In his ear,
"Shout tap the sap, Danny."

08:18.840 --> 08:21.680
"Which direction?" "Any way you
like, we've got you covered."

08:21.680 --> 08:23.760
Maple tapping,
not limited to humans.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.360
So squirrels have been seen
systematically biting...

08:26.360 --> 08:28.160
Stuck to trees.
Stuck, like that.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.400
"What's happened?"

08:29.400 --> 08:32.440
Systematically...
They never know their limits.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.960
"Oh, my gosh, my nuts are stuck."

08:36.360 --> 08:38.120
Sorry, Sandi,
I went too far with that.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.080
No, we're just... I'm trying to think
where to go from sticky nuts. Um...

08:41.080 --> 08:42.480
The bathroom.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.640
Yeah. They systematically bite
into maple trees to allow

08:45.640 --> 08:47.880
the sap to flow.
But here is the really clever thing,

08:47.880 --> 08:49.560
they don't just lap
it up there and go,

08:49.560 --> 08:52.760
"Yay, I got the sap to flow."
They leave it and return,

08:52.760 --> 08:54.600
so that once the water
has evaporated,

08:54.600 --> 08:57.840
there's a higher concentration
of the sugary sap.

08:57.840 --> 08:58.960
Clever.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.960
Thanks, squirrels. Isn't that great?

09:00.960 --> 09:02.840
Clever squirrel. Yeah, lovely.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.920
Yeah, I thought, "Hm, good on you.
Team players. I know.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.720
Explain to me how
adult liquorice works.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.240
All liquorice is adult liquorice,
because only adults like liquorice.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.640
Correct. Yeah.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.160
And I think sometimes mums pretend
to like it just

09:17.160 --> 09:19.960
so there's something in the house
that nobody else is going to eat.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.640
You've never been to Scandinavia,
we just all love liquorice.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.880
You love liquorice.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.360
And we are going to try some, OK?

09:26.360 --> 09:30.160
The thing that makes it adult
is that it is extremely salty.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.880
The flavour comes from
ammonium chloride,

09:32.880 --> 09:35.640
which the Finnish people
call salmiakki, OK?

09:35.640 --> 09:37.880
The Scandinavians
say the stronger

09:37.880 --> 09:40.480
and saltier the better,
and I absolutely agree.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.600
So you have a little bowl like this.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.400
Try it. If you don't like
liquorice... Who likes liquorice?

09:45.400 --> 09:47.040
I like liquorice.
I like liquorice.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.760
I don't know if I like salty
liquorice. This is adult liquorice.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.520
Ooh. Oh, my God.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.080
Huh? How good is that?

09:55.080 --> 09:57.080
Boy, oh, boy.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.280
That's disgusting.
Actually, actually...

09:59.280 --> 10:01.720
Coming around, Sandi,
I'm coming around.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.520
Isn't it good? Alan spat his out.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.960
My spine feels weird.
What's happening?

10:05.960 --> 10:07.720
That is...
Do you like that, Jason?

10:07.720 --> 10:10.520
I think once you get over
the initial shock...

10:10.520 --> 10:12.040
The disappointment.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.880
Yeah, it just becomes
disappointing, yeah.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.640
You just become steadily
more depressed.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.720
Yeah, it's all right.
There are health implications.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.320
Really?

10:21.320 --> 10:24.000
Thanks for telling us now.
Phew. I made the right call.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.040
Too much ammonium chloride
is bad for you,

10:26.040 --> 10:28.280
and so the European Union
wanted to set the cap

10:28.280 --> 10:30.080
at 0.3%.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.080
But liquorice is, like,
ten times that much,

10:32.080 --> 10:33.440
salty liquorice.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.680
And there was a genuine fear that
the people of Scandinavia,

10:36.680 --> 10:39.880
the Finns in particular,
would leave the EU

10:39.880 --> 10:41.800
if they messed
with their liquorice.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.920
Oh, God. You know.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.000
A Sami-exit. Yeah.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.120
So an exemption was made
for sweets and ice cream.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.960
It just has to say "Adult liquorice,
not liquorice for children" on it.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.960
Right.
Do you have to have ID to get it?

10:52.960 --> 10:55.040
I don't think you need to worry
about children

10:55.040 --> 10:56.760
accidentally eating this. I mean...

10:56.760 --> 10:58.720
It's incredibly
resistant to saliva.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.160
Yeah. That's a good quality
in a man, I think.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.040
ROSE GROANS

11:04.240 --> 11:06.480
Be a good thing to put in
a personal ad. Oh, my God...

11:06.480 --> 11:09.840
"Wanted - man, incredibly
resistant to saliva."

11:12.680 --> 11:13.960
Oh, my God...

11:13.960 --> 11:18.360
"Able to tolerate adult liquorice.
No other qualities necessary."

11:18.360 --> 11:20.560
I hope this doesn't become
a thing now.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.880
I don't want to start seeing...

11:21.880 --> 11:24.200
Every time you come on QI,
we give you a shit sweet.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.720
Sweet and... Yeah,
sweet and sour jelly babies.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.200
I don't want to see this.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.400
That's sort of like jerky,
isn't it, really?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.360
What, oh, do you like...?
I like jerky.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.480
I think jerky is absolutely lovely.
Not when you're expecting a sweet.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.920
Yeah. It's like a Jaffa Cake,

11:37.920 --> 11:40.800
but it's got chicken tikka
masala inside.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.160
But it has been so popular
for so long

11:43.160 --> 11:45.400
that it was found
in Tutankhamun's tomb.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.680
In the tomb, Sandi, in the tomb.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.640
Yeah. Let's bury it,
while he's going,

11:49.640 --> 11:51.560
while the lid's open,
put the liquorice in.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.240
It's incredibly resistant to saliva.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.080
Better seal it up, quick.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.240
Ancient Romans used it
for bladder problems,

11:59.240 --> 12:01.600
kidney stones, ulcers,
all sorts of things.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.680
Oh, it's medicine, yeah,
it tastes like medicine.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.080
It tastes a bit like medicine.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.240
But medicine when it's...
You know when you're a kid

12:07.240 --> 12:10.160
and medicine is actually quite nice?
It's like strawberry and banana

12:10.160 --> 12:12.560
and then, about 13, they go,
"Oh, you can have chalk now."

12:12.560 --> 12:15.080
Do you know what I mean?
It's that age of medicine.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.360
The English physician
Nicholas Culpeper -

12:17.360 --> 12:18.720
so we're talking 17th century -

12:18.720 --> 12:20.840
recommended taking it
against coughs,

12:20.840 --> 12:23.880
growths in the eye
and ulcers on the genitals.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.920
I mean, it already
tastes like it's been

12:25.920 --> 12:27.480
rubbed on someone's genitals.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.680
What is the town in the UK
that we link with liquorice?

12:33.680 --> 12:35.760
There's one town in West Yorkshire.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.320
Towns in West Yorkshire. Bassett?

12:37.320 --> 12:38.920
P.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Pontefract.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.160
Pontefract.
Of course it's Pontefract.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.760
Pontefract cakes, absolutely right.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.840
So it's extraordinary
that it's in Pontefract,

12:44.840 --> 12:47.160
because the plant is native
to Southern Europe

12:47.160 --> 12:48.640
and Western Asia.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.560
Probably arrived
in Pontefract in about

12:50.560 --> 12:53.160
the 16th century
via Dominican monks.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.160
And, by the 1920s, there were ten
liquorice factories in the town.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.200
But they're all sweet liquorice,
they're not...

12:59.200 --> 13:00.560
They're the sort you like.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.400
No-one's come in, like,
"Lads, have I got an idea for you."

13:03.400 --> 13:06.840
"Imagine it was this product that
we've been selling millions of,

13:06.840 --> 13:12.840
"but it tastes like shit.
Imagine that. Imagine. Huh, huh?"

13:12.840 --> 13:15.040
I love it,
I'm just saying to you.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.200
Not a single convert
in the house, Sandi.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.360
I know.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.800
Anyway, which head of state
did the Spice Girls sleep with?

13:21.800 --> 13:26.160
Well, I'm nervous to say this,
but Nelson Mandela?

13:26.160 --> 13:27.640
KLAXON BLARES

13:27.640 --> 13:29.240
Yeah. It's...

13:29.240 --> 13:32.080
Yeah. It seemed too obvious.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.320
I also sort of think
we'd have heard about that.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.520
Do you think? It feels like
a big story, you know.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.040
He said,
which is pretty shocking,

13:39.040 --> 13:41.720
that it was the best day of his
life when he met the Spice Girls.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.840
Was it? How?

13:42.840 --> 13:44.000
I met Nelson Mandela?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.760
Did you?
When I was three. In New Zealand.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.040
He came to speak

13:48.040 --> 13:50.600
and all of the crowd, like,
surged forward

13:50.600 --> 13:53.040
and I was sitting on a barrier
and it kind of pushed me

13:53.040 --> 13:54.440
and I was next to my brother.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.800
And so I started crying
and he came up to me

13:56.800 --> 13:58.720
and he was, like,
"Why are you crying?"

13:58.720 --> 14:01.480
And I was, like,
"My brother pushed me!"

14:01.480 --> 14:03.680
To Nelson Mandela.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.600
And then he was like, "Oh, don't
cry." And tried to comfort me.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.320
My mum was like,
"Do you know who that was?"

14:08.320 --> 14:10.680
And I was like, "No, I don't,
I'm three years old, right?"

14:10.680 --> 14:13.040
"Rose, he has bigger fish to fry."
Yeah, exactly.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.680
So the best day wasn't that day
that he met me.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.840
That's very upsetting.
What were you saying? Sorry.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.720
So we are slightly misleading you.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.440
Mel B's child has obviously
just farted.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.840
Oh, yes, yeah.
Which one's Mel B, Sandi?

14:25.840 --> 14:27.760
Yeah, come on, Sandi.
Point out the Mel B.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.160
Oh, yeah, you met her, didn't you?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.680
Mel B is the one wearing
a crocodile. That's right, yeah.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.880
Right, so we're talking China.
We're talking China,

14:33.880 --> 14:35.480
the spice girls of ancient China.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.360
So these were the concubines
who slept with the Emperor.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.560
Oh. What a job.
And we're calling them spice girls

14:40.560 --> 14:42.640
because, in the Han Dynasty China -

14:42.640 --> 14:46.200
so we're talking about 202 BC
to 220 AD -

14:46.200 --> 14:50.080
the Emperor's concubines would live
in a pepper house.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.840
So, basically, you've got mud
and plaster on the walls

14:52.840 --> 14:55.200
and it's mixed with Szechuan pepper.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.640
So the spice, it's really nice,

14:56.640 --> 14:59.280
it provides a sort of warm
and fragrant atmosphere,

14:59.280 --> 15:02.040
and also the plant is
a symbol of fertility,

15:02.040 --> 15:03.760
because it has so many seeds.

15:03.760 --> 15:06.640
And even today, they throw it
sometimes as confetti at newlyweds,

15:06.640 --> 15:09.160
sort of in rural areas of China.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.920
Szechuan pepper?
Szechuan pepper, yes.

15:10.920 --> 15:15.200
It's basically the dried berries
of the prickly ash tree.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.920
Anyway, you get the sensation, right.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.440
It's not really spiciness,

15:18.440 --> 15:20.800
it's like a tingling,
numbing sensation.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.520
So we're going to try it, OK.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.480
So, having gone for the liquorice,

15:24.480 --> 15:27.520
what I want you to do
is to take one and to bite...

15:27.520 --> 15:29.880
Just one... No, not the whole thing,
darling, you'll die.

15:29.880 --> 15:30.920
Oh. Yeah.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.960
Well, why would you put
all of them in there?

15:34.920 --> 15:36.480
Why would you risk that?

15:38.600 --> 15:40.200
I wanted to give you choice.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.440
I was about to... No.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.760
..down it in one. I was...

15:42.760 --> 15:43.840
Oh, my God.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.720
Last time we saw Jason Manford...

15:45.720 --> 15:48.160
So bite it and let it
cover your tongue.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.600
May I advise you not to swallow it?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.400
This is the worst game I've ever
played, since the liquorice game.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.920
Yeah, so...

15:54.920 --> 15:57.840
So bite it and then let it cover
your tongue,

15:57.840 --> 15:59.480
and you should get a sensation

15:59.480 --> 16:01.560
which is called paraesthesia and...

16:01.560 --> 16:03.400
Are you all right, Jason? That's...

16:03.400 --> 16:05.200
I... I...

16:05.200 --> 16:07.120
GARBLED: I think I've had a reaction.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.560
You know what this feels like at
the moment? Hm?

16:10.560 --> 16:13.520
It feels like, you know sometimes
you see something on the carpet

16:13.520 --> 16:15.560
and you think, oh,
it's a bit of a nut or something,

16:15.560 --> 16:17.440
it's a bit of a crumb of food. Yeah.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.360
And you pick it up
and put it in your mouth.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.680
And you think, actually,
that isn't food. No.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.160
That's come out of the dog's arse
or off the kids' shoes or something.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.680
Who let the rabbit in the house?

16:29.680 --> 16:31.120
What do you think, Alice?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.760
It is really citrusy.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.480
Yeah. Is it nice?

16:34.480 --> 16:36.440
It is actually kind of...
It's not unpleasant.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.240
Not unpleasant. It's almost got
the tingle of something menthol-y.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.240
Yes. And it gives you
just this kind of...

16:41.240 --> 16:42.960
It's almost like
a tiny little vibration.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.040
It reminds me of...
There's a cafe near me

16:45.040 --> 16:46.960
that hasn't been decorated
for 60 years.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.480
It reminds me of their loo.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.760
The surface of my tongue
now feels like it wants

16:51.760 --> 16:53.680
to leave my body,
is that what happens? Yeah.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.920
It's really fizzy, isn't it?

16:54.920 --> 16:57.560
It's like putting your wet
tongue on a battery.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.080
Ow. Hm, yes.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.600
So they did a test to see,
how many vibrations

17:01.600 --> 17:02.840
is it actually causing?

17:02.840 --> 17:04.840
And what they did was,
they got 28 volunteers

17:04.840 --> 17:07.280
and they were kitted out
with little tiny vibrating tools.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.240
And they were asked
to adjust it until it matched

17:09.240 --> 17:10.840
what they could feel
on their tongue.

17:10.840 --> 17:14.000
And Szechuan peppercorns make lips
vibrate at 50 hertz,

17:14.000 --> 17:15.640
which is the same as a cat's purr.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.480
Really?
Are you eating them all now?

17:17.480 --> 17:19.600
I've had them now. Finished.
Have you eaten the lot?

17:19.600 --> 17:20.800
Yeah.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.520
Are you swallowing them?

17:22.520 --> 17:24.000
Who said that?

17:27.840 --> 17:30.600
Your insides are going
to be vibrating at 50 hertz. Yeah.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.480
When did you learn to fly?
What's going on?

17:34.480 --> 17:37.240
Oh, my God, wow.
Hey, I tell you what,

17:37.240 --> 17:39.160
when you have a couple, woo!

17:40.360 --> 17:43.680
Now we're talking. Woohoo!

17:43.680 --> 17:45.080
He's having a good time now.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.560
You have a little line of blood
coming out of one nostril.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are you currently experiencing

17:49.680 --> 17:51.920
the last third of
2001: A Space Odyssey?

17:51.920 --> 17:54.560
You're just flying through space?
Oh, wow.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.080
Zingy and sherberty. Wow, yeah.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.600
Right, uh...

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
Jason is struggling now!

18:02.040 --> 18:04.720
No. "It's 3.47pm,

18:04.720 --> 18:07.880
"Jason has had a whole bowl
of peppercorns."

18:07.880 --> 18:09.160
Grandad?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.520
"It's four hours since Jason
had the peppercorns."

18:14.520 --> 18:17.320
I don't do drugs, like,
but that was the nearest...

18:17.320 --> 18:19.080
To doing. ..I've come to it.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.640
Yeah. I can actually see
the back of my head.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.520
New question -

18:27.520 --> 18:29.680
what did the original
Peter Piper pick?

18:31.200 --> 18:32.560
A pickled pepper. Pumpkin.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.120
KLAXON BLARES

18:34.120 --> 18:35.160
Oh.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.200
Not pepper. What else?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.480
Pumpkin. Pumpkin.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.720
Do they have pumpkin in
New Zealand? Is that a thing?

18:41.720 --> 18:42.960
They have pumpkin, yes,

18:42.960 --> 18:45.000
but also, weirdly, in New Zealand,
we eat pumpkin

18:45.000 --> 18:47.480
and, apparently, here,
you guys feed them to pigs.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.000
You're from England, I assume.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.600
Definitely.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.160
Do you eat pumpkin? No.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.240
Why not?

18:53.240 --> 18:54.960
I've got too many pigs to feed.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.360
So our best guess is that
it was a real person called -

19:04.360 --> 19:05.600
behind the tongue-twister -

19:05.600 --> 19:10.360
a one-armed French horticulturist
called Pierre Poivre.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.920
And it's a really interesting story.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.880
So we're talking 18th century.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.440
So he began his travels as a
mission... Are you all right?

19:16.440 --> 19:18.520
Yeah, I'm fine, yeah. Yeah.
You're sweating.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.120
I'm just thinking of all the
mistakes I've made in my life.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.840
You appear to be having
the menopause, darling.

19:23.840 --> 19:26.480
Oh, yeah, I'm... I'm having
everybody's menopause. Yeah.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.840
Why didn't you give him a little
bowl of ayahuasca? Yeah.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.840
I just... Don't give me
a full bowl of anything

19:31.840 --> 19:34.240
and then say,
"Do not eat the full bowl."

19:34.240 --> 19:36.360
Because I will do that.
Oh, my God... The future...

19:36.360 --> 19:38.160
Bring on the Starbursts.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.400
Who's this guy now? What's going on?
This guy, yeah.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.800
He wasn't interested in peppers
at all, he was involved...

19:43.800 --> 19:46.040
He's the Pied Piper.
Well, he... No.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.560
He was involved in the spice trade -

19:47.560 --> 19:50.200
he was interested in nutmeg,
cinnamon and cloves, not peppers.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.800
So he started his career
as a missionary in China.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.960
I don't know what happened,

19:53.960 --> 19:56.440
he was wrongfully arrested as soon
as he arrived. Who knows?

19:56.440 --> 19:57.600
Been there, buddy. I know.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.800
Been there.
So what he did - I like this -

19:59.800 --> 20:02.200
he taught himself Chinese
to defend himself in court.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.040
And when the mission ended,
he sailed back to France,

20:05.040 --> 20:06.880
but there was a skirmish
with a British ship

20:06.880 --> 20:08.840
and he lost an arm
to a cannonball.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.000
And we've all been there.
Worst holiday ever.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.400
Yeah. Had to rest up in Indonesia.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.880
Wow. And then he hatched a plan
to smuggle spices

20:16.880 --> 20:18.600
because, in the 18th century,

20:18.600 --> 20:20.120
it's sort of hard for us to believe,

20:20.120 --> 20:22.640
spices were the tradeable commodity.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.640
Some of them were worth
more than gold

20:24.640 --> 20:28.040
and the Dutch had complete control
over spice distribution.

20:28.040 --> 20:31.440
And they went to extreme measures
to make sure they had this monopoly.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.320
So, for example,
they'd get nutmeg seeds

20:33.320 --> 20:35.640
and they'd douse them in lime
before they exported them,

20:35.640 --> 20:38.400
so that they wouldn't sprout,
so that you couldn't grow your own.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.440
And smuggling seeds was a crime,
punishable by death.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.240
But he transported more than
3,000 plants into Mauritius

20:44.240 --> 20:47.120
and the Seychelles and Reunion,
and began growing them.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.680
It's one of the reasons why we have
spices that we can trade

20:49.680 --> 20:52.120
so easily today. This is...
Because nutmeg was used,

20:52.120 --> 20:54.040
wasn't it,
to preserve meat on the ship?

20:54.040 --> 20:55.920
Yeah. I mean, spices
were really important.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.440
And I know a little bit about this,

20:57.440 --> 20:59.560
because I went to
the Island of Banda in Indonesia,

20:59.560 --> 21:02.480
which was exchanged for what is now

21:02.480 --> 21:05.280
the island of Manhattan
in a property swap.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.320
Is that David Jason?
It looks like him.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.200
That's him, that's Peter.
Spitting image.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.240
That's Peter without either arm,
frankly.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.800
"I've got loads of nutmeg.
Yes, come in, come in."

21:14.800 --> 21:17.920
Have you seen those videos of, you
know, like the cinnamon challenge?

21:17.920 --> 21:20.560
You know, when people have a
teaspoon of cinnamon?

21:20.560 --> 21:22.640
When they snort it.
Because you can't swallow...

21:22.640 --> 21:24.600
A teaspoon of cinnamon?
A teaspoon of cinnamon.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.280
I've never tried. And I think
it works with nutmeg, as well.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.280
They are incredibly
resistant to saliva.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.960
That's the one thing about this.
Deeply resistant to saliva.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.520
But you have to be...
You have to be careful with nutmeg,

21:34.520 --> 21:36.760
because it contains a compound
called myristicin,

21:36.760 --> 21:38.240
and it can cause hallucinations.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.600
It's extremely -
it's profoundly untrustworthy.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.760
It can cause hallucinations
in high doses. Really?

21:42.760 --> 21:45.160
So it's a really, really bad idea.
"Where's Jason?"

21:45.160 --> 21:46.760
"He's on a bad nutmeg trip." Yeah.

21:46.760 --> 21:49.200
No, darling, you can
get all sorts of side-effects.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.240
You can get anxiety and fear and sort
of hostility and feeling like...

21:52.240 --> 21:55.080
I think I might have
been on nutmeg my whole life.

21:55.080 --> 21:59.000
It's... I did nutmeg
at Glastonbury, it was crazy!

21:59.000 --> 22:01.240
Yeah. So the nursery rhyme
that we were talking about

22:01.240 --> 22:02.640
at the very beginning, darling,

22:02.640 --> 22:04.640
that was very first published in 1813

22:04.640 --> 22:06.720
in Peter Piper's
Practical Principles of Plain

22:06.720 --> 22:08.280
and Perfect Pronunciation.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.080
And it has a tongue twister for
every single letter of the alphabet.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.600
So here is the one that we think
is based on this character,

22:13.600 --> 22:14.760
Pierre Poivre.

22:14.760 --> 22:15.960
But this is the S series,

22:15.960 --> 22:18.040
so we've got the rhyme for S.
Who wants to try?

22:18.040 --> 22:20.080
Let's do it.
Do it, Jason? Go for it.

22:20.080 --> 22:23.360
Sammy Smellie smelt
a smell of Small-coal.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.000
Did Sammy Smellie smell
a smelt of Small-coal?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
If Sammy Smellie smelt
a smell of Small-coal,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.520
where's the smell of small
coal Sammy Smellie smelt?

22:30.520 --> 22:32.840
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

22:35.000 --> 22:36.080
Wow.

22:36.080 --> 22:39.800
I'm having the same sort of surge
of rage that I used to have

22:39.800 --> 22:41.640
when one of my siblings
would get praised

22:41.640 --> 22:43.840
for doing a simple task...
Yeah, yeah.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.480
We also have a...
All right, whoa, whoa.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.880
..that I haven't been asked to do.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.440
What are you clapping that for?
He's just read it.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.440
All right. Hey, all right,
Billy Big-Balls, you have a go.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.560
Yeah, go on, then. Sammy Smellie
smelt a smell of Small-coal?

22:55.560 --> 22:57.000
It's on the bloody screen.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.200
All of it.
I had to do all of it.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.120
Did Sammy Smellie smell
a smelt of Small-coal?

23:00.120 --> 23:02.000
If Sammy Smellie smelt
a smell of Small-coal,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.200
where's the smell
of Small-coal Sammy Smellie smelt?

23:04.200 --> 23:05.840
APPLAUSE

23:04.200 --> 23:05.840
Yes, and he did do it faster.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.840
I don't want applause!
It's reading!

23:10.120 --> 23:11.680
Well done, Alan.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.320
OK, no, that's terribly impressive,
darling, well done. Oh, my God.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.760
Do you know what Small-coal is?
No, and care not.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.760
Anybody? Extra point.
I imagine it's tiny coal.

23:22.760 --> 23:26.200
It is.
For a tiny fire in a tiny house.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.720
It's what they used to call "slack".

23:27.720 --> 23:30.480
It's coal about the size of
hazelnuts. It's to start the fire.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.160
But I am terribly impressed
with your articulation.

23:33.160 --> 23:36.920
Peter Pepper nicked
a nugget of nibbly nutmeg.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.120
What makes my ice cream...?

23:36.920 --> 23:39.120
ALAN CLAPS

23:42.440 --> 23:44.800
Some of those words
began with the same letter!

23:46.720 --> 23:50.880
There's 40 years in the business.
40 years to achieve this.

23:50.880 --> 23:54.760
That's craft, that's stage craft,
right there. That is stage craft.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.520
That took my breath away.
Extraordinary.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.520
The same letter at
the beginning of the word.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.280
Thank you, darling. It is 40 years!
CHUCKLING

24:01.280 --> 24:03.360
What makes my ice cream
taste like shit?

24:03.360 --> 24:05.320
Maybe it's your bad attitude, Sandi.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.880
Maybe you're putting
liquorice in it! Maybe!

24:07.880 --> 24:10.000
KLAXON

24:07.880 --> 24:10.000
Oh!

24:13.240 --> 24:15.480
That looks tasty,
has that got cornflakes on?

24:15.480 --> 24:17.720
It looks actually quite good.
That does look nice.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.760
It's in a toilet bowl,
but I'll get over that.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.000
Is it shit? Has someone put shit in,
in the ice cream?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.680
Well, so, mammalian and bird
faeces get their smell

24:24.680 --> 24:27.840
from a high concentration
of a molecule called skatole.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.320
So it's a thing that we all
produce in our digestive tracts,

24:30.320 --> 24:33.040
and the people who produce too much
of it have terrible halitosis.

24:33.040 --> 24:36.160
Anyway, at very low concentrations it
has a sort of sweet, floral aroma.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.280
Like, I don't know, orange blossom
or jasmine or something.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.240
And so it's used in the ice cream
industry as a flavour enhancer.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.600
It can either smell great
or it can smell terrible.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.720
And it's also used in perfumes.
Yeah, like your own farts. Yeah.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.760
But it's used in perfumes
and colognes, as well,

24:49.760 --> 24:51.160
flavouring in cigarettes.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.120
The name is the Greek for dung.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.960
Anybody heard of something
called "castoreum"?

24:55.960 --> 25:00.320
It's taken from the glands found near
the rear ends of beavers. Oh...

25:00.320 --> 25:03.080
It gives depth to vanilla
and strawberry flavours. I'm sure...

25:03.080 --> 25:05.720
Rear end of a beaver? Yes, I know.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.200
Isn't that the beaver?
A beaver's beaver?

25:08.200 --> 25:10.520
Is it a beaver's beaver?
Yeah. You're thinking,

25:10.520 --> 25:12.800
"This strawberry ice cream
is lacking something."

25:12.800 --> 25:15.160
That's it, a bit of beaver.
"Get me a beaver." Yeah.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.840
Get me a beaver's beaver!
"Turn it around!

25:17.840 --> 25:20.880
"Turn it around,
this is the bit I'm interested in."

25:20.880 --> 25:22.280
CHUCKLING

25:23.840 --> 25:26.480
"Now this will be some
interesting ice cream."

25:27.960 --> 25:30.320
"It's got a bit of a beaver
gland in it!"

25:30.320 --> 25:33.800
"Hello, Walls?
Do I have a solution for you!"

25:33.800 --> 25:35.680
LAUGHTER

25:35.680 --> 25:38.960
In Sweden, there is a drink - it's
actually rare to find it these days -

25:38.960 --> 25:41.960
called Baverhojt, and it's a liqueur
flavoured with castoreum.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.720
It was traditionally
drunk by beaver trappers.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.800
Again, a job I hadn't thought of.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.880
MUSIC: TINKLING VERSION
OF GREENSLEEVES

25:48.880 --> 25:51.800
Ah. Anybody? What is that
approaching? Anybody? What is that?

25:51.800 --> 25:54.000
"Oh, Mum, can I have a pound?"
What is it?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
It's the ice-cream van!
It's the ice-cream van!

25:56.000 --> 25:59.040
Sorry, no, I've got to say, that is
the most terrifying soundscape

25:59.040 --> 26:01.840
of an ice cream van I have heard...
Yeah. That's what it used to be.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.000
So in the UK what would happen is,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.360
if you'd just got out of prison, you
were allowed to be an ice-cream man.

26:08.760 --> 26:12.360
And it was the only way you were
legally allowed near children.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.840
Wow. Yeah, that's how
it used to work.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.360
And so they would have that music,

26:16.360 --> 26:19.200
it was actually supposed
to be a warning but, weirdly,

26:19.200 --> 26:21.560
we all lined up and we waited to
meet the weirdo

26:21.560 --> 26:22.720
giving us ice creams.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.280
It was brilliant.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.200
Do they not have
ice-cream vans in New Zealand?

26:26.200 --> 26:28.600
No, they absolutely do,
but not with that

26:28.600 --> 26:32.760
child-catcher-esque sort of doomful
like... Yeah, it was a bit.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.520
Do you know what the tune is?

26:34.520 --> 26:35.880
Greensleeves. Yes.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.640
So, why do ice-cream vans play
Greensleeves so much?

26:38.640 --> 26:41.640
It's a banger. Yeah, I don't
know. Yeah, er, it's...

26:41.640 --> 26:44.320
It's something to do with
Henry VIII, it must be.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.880
It is to do with Henry VIII.
He invented ice cream.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.600
No, ice cream was invented
about 200 years after he passed.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.280
Oh, Henry VIII never had ice cream?
No, he...

26:52.280 --> 26:54.920
If he knew that he hadn't had
ice cream, he'd behead someone.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.440
Yeah, he'd be so cross.
"You mean I haven't had ice cream?"

26:57.440 --> 27:00.000
"It hasn't been invented."
"Kill someone!"

27:00.000 --> 27:01.720
So, we're going back to 1958,

27:01.720 --> 27:05.040
and there was a man called
Dominic Facchino.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.680
And he had been to the United States
and seen ice-cream trucks

27:07.680 --> 27:09.200
and he thought it was marvellous.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.280
And so he decided to
start his own venture,

27:11.280 --> 27:13.720
he started it in Birmingham.
The Mr Whippy ice-cream van.

27:13.720 --> 27:16.640
Mr Whippy, we've got Mr Whippy in
New Zealand, yeah. Mr Whippy.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.680
And he chose it because
he was a huge fan of Henry VIII.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.520
And the King was credited with
composing the tune. He didn't.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.560
Ah, no. No, he didn't compose
it at all. "I wrote that!"

27:25.560 --> 27:26.960
Yeah, it was not him. "OK, sir."

27:26.960 --> 27:28.520
"Yeah, all right, sir, yes."

27:28.520 --> 27:30.360
The real composer's in the Tower.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.960
"I've got an idea for a very, very
cold fruity dessert, as well."

27:33.960 --> 27:36.120
"In the Tower!" Yeah.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.840
And another nod to Henry
is Mr Whippy's hat,

27:39.840 --> 27:42.680
which Facchino intended to be
based on a Tudor hat.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.880
So, if you look at... Told you,
straight out... No way!

27:44.880 --> 27:47.800
Straight out of prison. Straight out
of prison, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.440
My friend's mum
used to tell her that

27:49.440 --> 27:52.160
when the music was playing it meant
they'd run out of ice cream.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.960
A common ruse. That's a clever mum.
Yeah. But it works, it does work.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.360
You wouldn't bother running down

27:56.360 --> 27:58.280
the street after it.
If they haven't got any.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.400
When I was a kid,
there was two ice cream vans.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.760
There was Mr Whippy
and there was Meski's.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.280
And my dad, who was a staunch
sort of socialist,

28:05.280 --> 28:09.800
verging on communist, to be fair,
said we weren't allowed Mr Whippy's

28:09.800 --> 28:11.400
because Margaret Thatcher

28:11.400 --> 28:15.560
was part of the scientific team who
created... That's true, Mr Whippy.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.160
..Mr Whippy ice cream.

28:17.160 --> 28:21.640
And he disliked her so much we
weren't allowed Mr Whippy ice cream.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.440
They always have, like, bootleg
cartoons painted on them,

28:24.440 --> 28:26.880
don't they, ice-cream vans?
Yes, yeah. Yeah.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.000
And you think,
if Disney just chased them down,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.360
they wouldn't really need to make
any other money.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.960
That dodgy-looking Goofy on the back
of there. Yeah.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.800
No, we can make millions from suing
you. We're getting it.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.800
So the question is, why don't
ice-cream trucks

28:38.800 --> 28:40.960
update their soundtrack?
Why do they not have, like,

28:40.960 --> 28:42.400
a Spotify playlist or something?

28:42.400 --> 28:44.720
Copyright? You don't want
Ed Sheeran suing Mr Whippy.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.280
Imagine, who would we
choose? We love them both.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.280
Greensleeves is surely
out of copyright. Yeah.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.800
That's one reason. One of the
reasons is that it's cheaper.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.240
The older tunes are... It's
unmistakably an ice-cream van.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.120
That's the other thing, darling.
It's that people know what's coming.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.800
It's not just some car with
their window down playing loud music.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.480
Beginning of lockdown,

29:01.480 --> 29:03.440
I read that Greggs the baker

29:03.440 --> 29:05.720
were going to do home deliveries,

29:05.720 --> 29:08.640
and I got excited
because I love a pasty from there,

29:08.640 --> 29:11.280
but I slowly realised that what they
meant was, like,

29:11.280 --> 29:13.880
on one of these apps,
like the delivery apps. Yeah.

29:13.880 --> 29:17.520
I thought it was like a Greggs van,
like an ice-cream van. Turn up.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.840
And you would just be,
like, sat in your living room

29:19.840 --> 29:22.000
and then you would hear
the Greggs van music playing

29:22.000 --> 29:23.960
and you'd run to your wife,
"Can I have a pound?

29:23.960 --> 29:25.960
"The Greggs van's here."
And she'd be like,

29:25.960 --> 29:28.440
"I've got pasties in the freezer."
"They're not the same!"

29:28.440 --> 29:30.960
But unfortunately that's not
a business that they've done.

29:30.960 --> 29:34.200
You've got pasties in the freezer?!
Yeah, they sell them at Iceland.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.840
Look, I'm not going to keep
plugging these things!

29:36.840 --> 29:39.320
I feel so sorry for your children.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.240
Come in from a long day of playing
with sticks and they say,

29:42.240 --> 29:43.720
"Can I have an ice cream?"

29:43.720 --> 29:46.320
"No, you can lick a frozen pasty
like your dad."

29:49.880 --> 29:51.640
If your ice cream
smells like shit,

29:51.640 --> 29:53.560
someone's overdone the skatole.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.840
What kind of person gives
away their starters?

29:56.840 --> 29:58.880
I sometimes have a
starter for pudding.

29:58.880 --> 30:02.000
I'll have an avocado prawn to finish.
Yeah, exactly, yeah. Love it.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.120
Really? Yeah. Starters used to
be terrible in Britain.

30:05.120 --> 30:08.120
I don't know about New Zealand, but
they used to be terrible in Britain.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.920
You used to get, "Would you like the
orange juice?" The fruit juice.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.560
The fruit juice.
Yeah. What do you mean?

30:12.560 --> 30:14.360
And it would come
on a little thing.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.080
And it would be the only
time in the year

30:16.080 --> 30:18.200
that you would get
squeezed orange juice.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.800
I'd feel really swizzed at that.
Vile. Or you get...

30:20.800 --> 30:21.920
We all had scurvy.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.800
..half a boiled egg with some salad
cream, that's a very nice starter.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.360
Oh, yeah, that's a nice one.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.480
When they've taken it out
and put it back in again?

30:28.480 --> 30:31.560
No, not even bothered with that.
Literally, just half a boiled egg.

30:31.560 --> 30:34.560
No, not the starter course of a
meal. What other types of starter?

30:34.560 --> 30:37.000
Oh, well, then you misled us,
didn't you, Sandi? Once again.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.440
That is literally my job.

30:38.440 --> 30:40.640
I can't keep giving
you second chances.

30:40.640 --> 30:43.240
Is it like a sourdough?
It is, exactly right.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.880
I had a lot of that in lockdown.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.960
Jason is there,
absolutely right.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.920
So sourdough gets its sour
flavour from Lactobacillus bacteria,

30:51.920 --> 30:55.000
so that's introduced to the bread
via... It's called a starter.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.360
It's basically a mix of flour
and water, which is left for a number

30:58.360 --> 31:01.720
of days until wild yeast and microbes
from the environment have grown.

31:01.720 --> 31:04.160
People, like, pass them
through the families, don't they?

31:04.160 --> 31:05.600
Well, this is the thing, darling,

31:05.600 --> 31:08.240
people pass them on and are slightly
obsessed with their...

31:08.240 --> 31:10.600
I'm that person. Are you?
Have you got a starter?

31:10.600 --> 31:13.280
I do have a starter and I did give
it away in the first lockdown.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.560
It's a lot of work.

31:14.560 --> 31:17.320
It's the same with scobies,
with kombucha, right? Yes.

31:17.320 --> 31:20.080
And people become really obsessed
with it. Really obsessed.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.400
In fact, you can tell
whose starter it is,

31:22.400 --> 31:25.600
because you get particular
bacteria on everybody's hands, right.

31:25.600 --> 31:28.160
So you can usually match
a starter to the baker

31:28.160 --> 31:31.120
if you were able to test the bacteria
on the hands and the bacteria on...

31:31.120 --> 31:32.800
I'm riddled.
I'm absolutely riddled.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.560
You're riddled with the stuff. Yeah.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.200
Theoretically, you can keep
the starter alive forever and you

31:37.200 --> 31:40.280
just keep feeding it flour and water,
and pass it down from generations.

31:40.280 --> 31:43.160
S, it's possible that bakers could
be using the same starter

31:43.160 --> 31:46.160
that their great-grandparents used.
I'd love to be at that will reading,

31:46.160 --> 31:48.040
where it's, like, someone
gets a house,

31:48.040 --> 31:50.360
someone gets a car.
"I got a... I got a what?"

31:50.360 --> 31:52.160
Do you know what's even...
"Great!"

31:52.160 --> 31:56.080
..even odder, I think, is that people
name their sourdough starters.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.680
So there's a series of names,
Jane Dough.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.400
Joan of Starch. Aw.

32:01.400 --> 32:04.160
Fred Farter the Bread Starter.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.720
John McEndough.

32:05.720 --> 32:08.400
And Clint Yeastwood.
Yes. Great one, love that.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.280
Very good. Yeah.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.640
So, what is stressful for a
sourdough enthusiast about holidays?

32:13.640 --> 32:16.040
Well, you wouldn't be able to
take it with you?

32:16.040 --> 32:18.160
You wouldn't be able to take
it on holiday with you.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.280
You'd have to fridge it,
which is quite stressful.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.600
You can't. Ooh, can't, no.
What if it starves while...

32:22.600 --> 32:25.360
You look like you could
care about sourdough people?

32:25.360 --> 32:27.360
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.880
Imagine you came home
and your sourdough was dead.

32:29.880 --> 32:33.280
If you put it in the fridge it goes
to sleep for a bit, but the

32:33.280 --> 32:36.320
chances of it coming back as it was,
will it have the same memories?

32:36.320 --> 32:37.400
Will it be as fun? No.

32:37.400 --> 32:41.040
So there are now sourdough hotels.

32:41.040 --> 32:44.440
Oh, my God. Yes. Finally!
Finally, thank you.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.680
Yeah, at last.
There's a man called Martin Mayer

32:46.680 --> 32:48.840
who runs the
Vuaillat Bakery in Zurich,

32:48.840 --> 32:51.600
and he started
his sourdough hotel because he went

32:51.600 --> 32:55.400
on holiday to South Africa and he
took it with him, his starter, right,

32:55.400 --> 32:58.600
and he was worried about it in
the heat in the car all the time.

32:58.600 --> 33:04.120
And so he developed a hotel, and each
starter is put in its own compartment

33:04.120 --> 33:07.520
and the staff are told how the person
wants their starter treated.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.160
And, apparently,
owners come and say goodbye

33:10.160 --> 33:13.000
and are visibly thrilled
when they are reunited. Wow.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.960
It's 49 francs a week, if you want to
put your sourdough in there.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.320
That's not bad. Did you not take to
baking, darling, in the lockdown?

33:19.320 --> 33:22.520
That didn't happen? No. I've
just... What is happening here?

33:22.520 --> 33:25.640
What about these simple questions,
Alan, you've eaten sourdough,

33:25.640 --> 33:28.000
you know nothing
about the process of making it.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.640
Out of the 706 people in Britain
who make their own bread,

33:30.640 --> 33:33.480
four of them are in this room?

33:33.480 --> 33:35.000
People take it so seriously.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.520
So there's a man called... He's a
Belgian baker called Karl de Smedt,

33:38.520 --> 33:40.240
and he's a sourdough librarian.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.240
This is his sourdough library.
No, he's not.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.960
Yes. That's not a job.
It is a thing. I'm sorry.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.600
If you go to the Jobcentre and go,
"What have you been up to?"

33:47.600 --> 33:50.720
And go, "I'm a sourdough librarian.
Anything coming up?" No chance.

33:50.720 --> 33:54.680
He travels the world collecting
interesting sourdough starters.

33:54.680 --> 33:58.720
Wow, that's... He's currently
got 125 in his library.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.160
Anyway, this is a very sad thing,

34:00.160 --> 34:02.320
I just need you to feel
bad for Karl De Smedt.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.960
He's since developed
an allergy to flour...!

34:04.960 --> 34:06.120
Wow.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.880
Oh, Karl...

34:08.880 --> 34:11.840
Do you know what the difference is
between ordinary bread and sourdough?

34:11.840 --> 34:13.960
Taste, price? No, it's the yeast.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.640
So most bread uses a single
species of commercial yeast.

34:16.640 --> 34:19.760
Sourdough, it takes it from the air,
from the baker's hands,

34:19.760 --> 34:21.880
from the environment and so on.

34:21.880 --> 34:25.240
But it is the oldest form
of leavened bread, sourdough.

34:25.240 --> 34:28.200
I mean, there's astonishing stuff,
if you went to Thebes,

34:28.200 --> 34:30.520
if you went to some of
the ancient Egyptian sites,

34:30.520 --> 34:34.640
you can actually find
3,500-year-old bread.

34:34.640 --> 34:38.120
And what is amazing about it
is you can see the handprint

34:38.120 --> 34:40.680
of the baker
in either side of the bread.

34:40.680 --> 34:43.320
3,000 years old? 3,500 years ago,
yeah. Really? That's the kind

34:43.320 --> 34:45.520
of bread that my mum would just go,
"No, that's fine!"

34:45.520 --> 34:47.680
It's fine. "That's fine.
Just scrape it off!"

34:47.680 --> 34:49.960
"Cut the green bit off."
"Scrape it off!" Yeah.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.080
And with that we stumble
into the sweet

34:52.080 --> 34:53.880
and sour swamp of General Ignorance.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.320
Fingers on buzzers, please.

34:55.320 --> 34:58.200
Where does the UK get most
of its sugar from?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.600
Yes?
# Sweet dreams... #

35:01.600 --> 35:03.120
Morrison's?

35:03.120 --> 35:04.600
Morrison's.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.400
Good answer, yeah. I think
it's a very good answer. Yeah.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.680
Anybody want to name
any other places?

35:12.680 --> 35:14.160
Hm.

35:16.120 --> 35:19.880
No? What's a country, OK?
What is a country...?

35:19.880 --> 35:20.960
Just generally?

35:20.960 --> 35:22.760
# Sweet Home Alabama... #
Just any country,

35:22.760 --> 35:24.280
it comes from a country?

35:24.280 --> 35:26.520
Does it come from a country?

35:26.520 --> 35:27.880
A country other than the UK? Yes.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.720
No. What?

35:29.720 --> 35:32.040
Yes. So not...
I thought that was foolproof.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.760
No. You went...

35:33.760 --> 35:36.880
You went wide and were wrong.

35:36.880 --> 35:41.360
No. Over 50% is supplied by
the British beet sugar industry.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.560
And the rest is from the EU,

35:43.560 --> 35:45.640
and then there is
a bit of cane sugar imported,

35:45.640 --> 35:47.680
but the majority is grown in the UK.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.480
On the topic of Britain and sugar,

35:49.480 --> 35:51.680
do you think we're eating more
or less than we used to?

35:51.680 --> 35:53.240
I think we're probably eating less.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.760
Yeah, it sort of depends on what
you say what we were used to.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.320
So there was a significant
increase in sugar intake

35:58.320 --> 36:00.120
starting around the 1950s

36:00.120 --> 36:04.200
and it reached 47.3 kilos
per capita in 1961.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.520
But it has been declining.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.240
Today it's about 35.2 kilos
of sugar per person.

36:09.240 --> 36:12.680
But the sweeteners, anybody use
sweeteners? No. No. OK.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.680
Saccharin,
the first artificial sweetener,

36:14.680 --> 36:17.520
roughly 300 times sweeter
than table sugar.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.360
And Splenda, which is
sucralose, 600 times sweeter.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.800
There's a new one
called Neotame,

36:22.800 --> 36:25.440
10,000 times sweeter than sugar.

36:25.440 --> 36:28.680
My nan loves it, loves a Sucral
in her tea. Really? Yeah.

36:28.680 --> 36:32.080
Yeah, my gran has a couple of...
She's 97 and she has -

36:32.080 --> 36:34.360
I think she has something like two
or three sweeteners.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.600
And she's 97. Yes.
Doesn't matter, does it?

36:36.600 --> 36:38.240
She's already living
on borrowed time.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.640
She can have whatever she wants.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.800
She could start crack tomorrow
if she wants to, at 97.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.720
"Well, do you know, I fancy
a bit of crack, actually."

36:45.720 --> 36:49.240
Help yourself.
Fine, 97, knock yourself out.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.880
Most British sugar is home-grown.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.400
What did William Wrigley Junior
start a company for?

36:55.400 --> 36:57.320
# Alabama... #

36:57.320 --> 36:58.800
It's chewing gum?

36:58.800 --> 36:59.960
KLAXON BLARES

36:59.960 --> 37:02.120
Oh, I was totally going
to say that. I'm so glad.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.160
Yeah, I, oh...

37:03.160 --> 37:07.000
Alan? Chewing gum was
a kind of accidental by-product

37:07.000 --> 37:09.280
to something, wasn't it,
that they were trying to make?

37:09.280 --> 37:11.720
Well, chewing gum has been around
for thousands of years,

37:11.720 --> 37:15.200
because people chewed on birch sap
and all kinds of bits.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.560
He actually started
a company selling soap, in 1891.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.640
But he believed -
he had a philosophy,

37:20.640 --> 37:22.640
everybody likes something extra
for nothing.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.680
So he started offering baking powder
as a promotional item

37:25.680 --> 37:28.040
and that was such a success,
he just went straight

37:28.040 --> 37:29.160
to baking powder.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.960
And then chewing gum
became his freebie.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.960
And soon the chewing gum was more
popular than anything else.

37:34.960 --> 37:38.680
And by 1892
he was just selling chewing gum,

37:38.680 --> 37:41.800
and these favourites,
Juicy Fruit and Spearmint there,

37:41.800 --> 37:45.480
1893, they had become
the absolute favourites

37:45.480 --> 37:47.040
that they I think still are.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.520
That's incredible that the branding
is pretty much the same.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.560
Hasn't really changed, has it?
Not really.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.040
By 1909, Wrigley's Spearmint
was the best-selling gum

37:54.040 --> 37:55.760
in the US.
And he did this brilliant thing,

37:55.760 --> 37:58.160
he collected all the addresses
from American phone books

37:58.160 --> 37:59.960
and sent a packet
to every single home.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.680
And then everybody knew about
Wrigley's. And the rest is history.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.680
But to talk about people
chewing gum forever -

38:04.680 --> 38:08.960
in 2019, scientists at
the University of Copenhagen...

38:08.960 --> 38:10.000
Globe...

38:10.000 --> 38:12.800
They managed -
this is astonishing.

38:12.800 --> 38:16.480
They managed to sequence
a complete genome of a human being

38:16.480 --> 38:19.960
based on the saliva from
a discarded piece of chewing gum

38:19.960 --> 38:23.960
which was 5,000 years old.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.760
Wow. It came from
the Island of Lolland.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.480
Lolland is just south
of Copenhagen

38:27.480 --> 38:30.240
and so they named this girl
who had eaten this piece

38:30.240 --> 38:32.520
of chewing gum Lola,
they called her, after Lolland.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.640
And they deduced from this one piece
of gum

38:35.640 --> 38:37.720
that she was lactose intolerant,

38:37.720 --> 38:39.760
she suffered from gum disease,
she had blue eyes,

38:39.760 --> 38:41.040
dark skin, dark hair

38:41.040 --> 38:43.360
and had recently eaten
a meal of duck

38:43.360 --> 38:45.680
with hazelnuts,
from that one piece of gum.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.400
Wow. Do you not think
that's astonishing?

38:47.400 --> 38:50.440
And she wasn't brought up right if
she stuck that under a bus seat.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.600
That's amazing.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.360
But I just think that's incredible.
That is, that's so cool.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.240
That's phenomenal, wow.
It's very cool.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.960
Anyway, this is an artist's
impression of what we know about her.

38:59.960 --> 39:04.480
Can you name any South American
countries due south of Mexico?

39:06.280 --> 39:07.480
Brazil?

39:07.480 --> 39:09.360
KLAXON BLARES

39:11.240 --> 39:14.440
It's going to be none of them,
isn't it? Argentina.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.520
KLAXON BLARES

39:16.520 --> 39:18.320
What, so what is it?
There aren't any?

39:18.320 --> 39:20.000
Chile.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.680
KLAXON BLARES

39:20.000 --> 39:22.680
I could do this all day!

39:22.680 --> 39:24.080
What do you reckon, Alan?

39:24.080 --> 39:26.720
Well, it feels like there can't be
any, then.

39:26.720 --> 39:29.360
There aren't. The whole...
OK, it must be twisted around.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.200
Yeah, so,
so when you look at the map,

39:31.200 --> 39:34.960
the whole of the South American
mainland is east of Mexico.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.000
Indeed, 99% of it
is east of Florida.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.880
The only exception is Easter Island,

39:38.880 --> 39:40.800
which does politically belong
to Chile.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.560
So you could have said Chile and we
wouldn't have... I did say Chile.

39:43.560 --> 39:47.120
Did you say Chile? Yeah, so scrub
that, I was right. Yeah, sorry.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.840
KLAXON BLARES

39:52.680 --> 39:55.720
One way to remember that
South America sticks out like that

39:55.720 --> 39:57.360
is to sort of imagine it on its side

39:57.360 --> 39:59.880
and then the Americas
look uncannily like a duck.

39:59.880 --> 40:03.280
If we can swivel that round
like that.

40:03.280 --> 40:05.040
Oh, wow.
That's very cool, isn't it?

40:05.040 --> 40:07.160
Yeah. I mean, it helps that you've
coloured it in.

40:07.160 --> 40:08.760
Yeah. I think that is true.

40:08.760 --> 40:12.120
Yeah. A lot of things can look like
a duck if you colour them in.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.520
You may think it's quackers,

40:13.520 --> 40:16.200
but all of South America
is east of Mexico.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.400
OK, imagine you work
for British intelligence,

40:18.400 --> 40:19.920
who can you tell?

40:20.920 --> 40:22.800
Well, anybody,
but then you have to kill them.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.200
KLAXON BLARES

40:24.200 --> 40:25.520
What?

40:29.440 --> 40:30.800
Wow.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.120
Are you in my head now?

40:33.120 --> 40:35.400
KLAXON BLARES

40:42.560 --> 40:44.880
No, it's not the answer.
Anybody else?

40:44.880 --> 40:46.360
Your mum?

40:46.360 --> 40:49.880
You could tell your mum.
Yes, you could tell your mum.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.120
How many people do you think you
could tell? Two people.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.920
It's not actually a number, darling.
What?

40:53.920 --> 40:56.560
It's the people that you feel
it's essential for you to tell

40:56.560 --> 40:58.680
in order for you to be able
to carry on with the work.

40:58.680 --> 41:01.000
So you just started seeing a guy,
like, for two months

41:01.000 --> 41:03.280
and you're, like,
"I just want to tell him."

41:03.280 --> 41:04.960
Yes. And then, I...

41:04.960 --> 41:07.840
And then you get assigned
an agent handler to discuss

41:07.840 --> 41:10.080
the pros and cons of making
an informed decision

41:10.080 --> 41:11.600
as to whether or not
you should tell.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.840
Really? Yeah.
So they'll check it out.

41:13.840 --> 41:17.680
The general advice is to tell
close family members or friends. OK.

41:17.680 --> 41:20.360
There was an MI6 employee
who was invited by the BBC

41:20.360 --> 41:22.720
to be interviewed, and he told them
that the interviewer

41:22.720 --> 41:25.200
was the sixth person he had told.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.160
I mean, I'm not saying
it's the same thing,

41:27.160 --> 41:29.600
but I didn't tell anybody
I was on the Masked Singer.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.960
So, you know, that's pretty good.
Were you on that?

41:31.960 --> 41:34.440
Yeah, that's pretty good
isn't it? What were you on it?

41:34.440 --> 41:37.000
I was an 'edgehog. You're
the sixth person I've told.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.840
LAUGHTER

41:38.840 --> 41:40.920
And now she has to die.
I know.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.360
I didn't even tell my daughter,
and on the night of the final,

41:43.360 --> 41:46.000
when it was happening,
she was watching it at a friend's

41:46.000 --> 41:48.320
and all her friends were going,
"That's your daddy."

41:48.320 --> 41:51.360
And she was going, "I think I would
know if my dad was on a TV show."

41:51.360 --> 41:53.720
As it came off, she was livid.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.880
Was it stressful not to tell
anyone? No, it's great fun.

41:56.880 --> 42:00.040
The only time it backfired was,
I was on the phone to Alfie Boe,

42:00.040 --> 42:02.840
who's, you know, brilliant opera
singer, good friend of mine,

42:02.840 --> 42:05.280
and I said, "Have you been
watching this Masked Singer?"

42:05.280 --> 42:07.520
He said, "Yeah, every Saturday
night, I keep getting

42:07.520 --> 42:09.960
"loads of tweets off people saying,
'Are you the hedgehog?'

42:09.960 --> 42:12.600
"So I thought, I'll watch it,
see what everyone's going on about.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.000
"I watched this hedgehog singing
and I thought to myself,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
"'I'm not that shit
at singing, am I?'"

42:17.000 --> 42:19.680
Oh, wow. And I was, I was on
the phone to him, I was like,

42:19.680 --> 42:22.720
"Yeah, well, maybe the costume's
really heavy or something!"

42:24.160 --> 42:25.760
That's very good.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.680
There's a marvellous story about
Rupert Murdoch. So he was furious,

42:28.680 --> 42:30.960
he was told that the former
News Of The World editor,

42:30.960 --> 42:32.560
Rebekah Brooks, couldn't take a call

42:32.560 --> 42:35.280
because she'd gone to the furniture
store, which is called MFI.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.920
And, apparently,
her PA had misheard her

42:37.920 --> 42:40.360
and she'd gone to an MI5 meeting.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.600
I think if you work for MFI,
you shouldn't tell anybody.

42:47.320 --> 42:49.160
Speaking of concealing
your intelligence,

42:49.160 --> 42:50.440
it must be time for the scores.

42:50.440 --> 42:51.720
In last place,

42:51.720 --> 42:53.720
as useful as a chocolate teapot,

42:53.720 --> 42:56.120
with minus 28, it's Alice.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.520
APPLAUSE

42:58.960 --> 43:02.480
Scoring some brownie points in third
with minus 24, it's Alan.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.000
APPLAUSE

43:06.840 --> 43:10.520
A super sugar-daddy in second,

43:10.520 --> 43:13.080
with minus 20, it's Jason.
I'll take that, I'll take that.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.720
Second will do me.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.040
And one smart cookie in first place,

43:18.040 --> 43:20.200
with minus 19, it's Rose.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.600
CHEERING

43:20.200 --> 43:22.600
Don't know how that happened.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.640
That's all from us tonight.
My thanks to Alice,

43:29.640 --> 43:31.480
Jason, Rose and Alan.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.480
And I leave you
with this savoury sign-off.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.920
If it looks like a duck,
walks like a duck,

43:35.920 --> 43:37.200
talks like a duck,

43:37.200 --> 43:39.440
probably needs a little bit
more time in the oven.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.080
Goodnight.

43:41.080 --> 43:43.400
APPLAUSE
