WEBVTT

00:01.714 --> 00:03.114
you don't have to be alone

00:03.115 --> 00:06.051
you have plenty guys
would date you for real

00:06.052 --> 00:08.004
you seem to forget I'm your boss.

00:08.732 --> 00:11.111
You break up with
Emma or you're fired.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.809
If you are making me choose,

00:12.810 --> 00:14.828
between you and Emma,

00:14.829 --> 00:16.777
then I choose her.

00:18.325 --> 00:20.570
I'm pregnant.

00:21.838 --> 00:24.074
You've met Mr. Daniels.

00:24.075 --> 00:25.262
You're a... teacher.

00:25.263 --> 00:26.339
I just can't believe this.

00:26.340 --> 00:29.804
I mean, this is all from
when Lux lived here?

00:29.805 --> 00:30.823
I went to Valerie's.

00:30.824 --> 00:32.077
What did Valerie tell you?

00:32.078 --> 00:33.216
That you were violent with them,

00:33.217 --> 00:34.681
that you hit her husband...

00:34.682 --> 00:36.592
Lux... I'm the violent one?

00:36.593 --> 00:38.166
Get the hell off my property!

00:38.167 --> 00:39.585
Hey, hey! Get out of here!

00:42.042 --> 00:44.736
We have a warrant
for Natasha Siviac

00:44.737 --> 00:46.308
for assault.

00:58.182 --> 00:59.217
Tasha's statement said

00:59.218 --> 01:01.166
you two left the homecoming dance,

01:01.167 --> 01:03.147
stole your mom's car

01:03.148 --> 01:05.678
and confronted Valerie
Gilbert at her home.

01:05.679 --> 01:07.038
Lux didn't steal the car.

01:07.039 --> 01:08.545
His girlfriend's son did.

01:09.133 --> 01:10.059
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:10.060 --> 01:12.583
Um... is Tasha okay?

01:12.584 --> 01:14.424
Actually, I-I did.

01:14.425 --> 01:15.660
I stole your car;

01:15.661 --> 01:17.260
I'm the one who drove
it and crashed it.

01:17.261 --> 01:19.120
Sam covered for me

01:19.121 --> 01:21.107
a neighbor heard you and Mr.
Gilbert arguing

01:21.108 --> 01:23.364
and said he tried to remove
you from his property.

01:23.365 --> 01:25.818
She said it looked like
you were resisting.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.341
What? I wasn't resisting.

01:27.342 --> 01:28.985
He grabbed me to try
and throw me out,

01:28.986 --> 01:30.005
and he was hurting me.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.488
That's why Tasha stopped him.

01:31.489 --> 01:33.065
By hitting him on the
head with a shovel?

01:33.066 --> 01:35.161
Wait, what? What about a shovel?

01:35.162 --> 01:37.461
What is going on?

01:37.827 --> 01:40.100
That's why Tasha was arrested.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.821
She hit Valerie's husband... Lux!

01:43.197 --> 01:45.153
You know what? We barely
know what's happening.

01:45.154 --> 01:47.037
We should not be doing this
without a lawyer present.

01:47.038 --> 01:50.093
You know what? Ryan is right.
Wh... why do we need a lawyer?

01:50.094 --> 01:52.519
Just to be safe. Tasha was arrested.
But Lux wasn't.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.422
She's not in any trouble, right?

01:54.423 --> 01:57.242
No, but if the state
chooses to press charges,

01:57.243 --> 01:59.658
against Tasha,
Lux may have to testify.

01:59.659 --> 02:02.327
But no, she's not in
any trouble, not yet.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.353
I should've known that you
were gonna go to Valerie's.

02:05.354 --> 02:07.211
I mean, of course,
you went to Valerie's.

02:07.212 --> 02:08.579
Yes, I went tat trey says

02:08.580 --> 02:09.884
she told you a billion
lies about me,

02:09.886 --> 02:11.647
and I wanted her to stop.
I don't get it.

02:11.648 --> 02:12.899
If you went there
to talk to Valerie,

02:12.900 --> 02:14.695
how did you end up fighting
with this trey dude?

02:14.696 --> 02:16.197
Here, there's Tasha.

02:19.620 --> 02:20.677
Tash!

02:21.371 --> 02:22.299
You okay?

02:22.300 --> 02:25.403
Yeah, once fern got those
Nazis to let me go.

02:25.404 --> 02:27.028
There's no bail for juveniles,

02:27.029 --> 02:29.505
but you'll be responsible
for Tasha until her hearing.

02:29.506 --> 02:31.619
When will we know if the
state's pressing charges?

02:31.620 --> 02:32.986
Depends on what trey says.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.661
The police are trying to
get a statement from him.

02:34.662 --> 02:35.869
Uh-huh. And if they do?

02:35.870 --> 02:38.447
Let's cross that bridge
when we come to it.

02:44.436 --> 02:46.993
Well, they're in bed finally.

02:47.395 --> 02:49.782
Can you believe it's
still Thanksgiving?

02:49.783 --> 02:52.232
Dinner at Baze's seems
like a week ago.

02:52.986 --> 02:54.318
Thank you. Yeah.

02:54.319 --> 02:56.452
Well, let's just be
thankful everyone's okay.

02:56.453 --> 02:58.354
Is Lux okay?

02:58.355 --> 03:00.051
She was so mad about
what Valerie said

03:00.052 --> 03:03.865
that she stole my car, crashed it,
lied to me about it...

03:03.866 --> 03:06.733
Not to mention she was an
accomplice to an assault...

03:06.734 --> 03:08.407
Come here. You don't
have to do this.

03:08.408 --> 03:10.010
Do what?

03:10.011 --> 03:12.590
You don't have to nice to
me because I'm pregnant.

03:12.591 --> 03:14.170
Cate... what, we got back

03:14.171 --> 03:17.650
together, like, two seconds
before all of this hit the fan?

03:19.571 --> 03:21.870
You don't have to be St. Ryan.

03:21.871 --> 03:23.438
You can still back out.

03:23.439 --> 03:25.301
I am not a Saint.

03:25.302 --> 03:27.168
I'm your husband.

03:27.169 --> 03:28.916
And Lux's stepdad,

03:28.917 --> 03:30.939
Tasha's guardian,
the father of your baby.

03:30.940 --> 03:32.646
Our baby.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.825
I'm in as deep as you are.

03:37.627 --> 03:39.298
We'll figure this out.

03:48.869 --> 03:51.359
What did you tell the cops?

03:52.483 --> 03:54.005
Everything.

03:54.759 --> 03:56.674
About when I lived there?

03:56.675 --> 03:58.055
Did you say trey hit me?

03:58.056 --> 04:00.398
Almost everything.

04:00.399 --> 04:02.634
Why can't we tell them?

04:02.635 --> 04:05.438
If they know he's a jerk-wad
who beats on little girls,

04:05.439 --> 04:06.522
then they'll believe us.

04:06.523 --> 04:08.583
That I had to stop him.

04:08.584 --> 04:10.485
They don't need to know
what happened four years ago

04:10.486 --> 04:11.846
to believe us now.

04:11.847 --> 04:13.546
Dude, have you seen my rap sheet?

04:13.547 --> 04:15.866
They'll never take
my word over trey's.

04:15.867 --> 04:18.752
I'll lose everything,
independent living,

04:18.753 --> 04:20.503
being at Westmonte,
being with you...

04:20.504 --> 04:23.854
That's not gonna happen.
And if it does...

04:23.855 --> 04:26.764
Then will you say something?

04:34.217 --> 04:35.900
Minnesota.

04:36.447 --> 04:37.596
Again.

04:39.635 --> 04:41.400
You can't avoid him forever.

04:42.119 --> 04:44.297
He was there when I got arrested.

04:44.875 --> 04:45.592
Sooner or later,

04:45.593 --> 04:48.093
you're gonna have to
tell him what's going on.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.527
Lux. Thank God.

05:07.448 --> 05:09.062
Hey, you got all
my messages, right?

05:09.063 --> 05:09.988
Yeah. Yeah.

05:09.989 --> 05:11.482
It's just been kind of crazy.

05:11.483 --> 05:12.559
Yeah. No kidding.

05:13.096 --> 05:14.074
And when the police showed up,

05:14.075 --> 05:17.832
I thought they were gonna
arrest me, not Tasha.

05:18.429 --> 05:18.964
What happened?

05:18.965 --> 05:19.977
Is she okay?

05:20.833 --> 05:22.973
It's... it's a long story.

05:22.974 --> 05:26.224
I... I don't even
know all the details.

05:29.859 --> 05:32.177
So you don't know why
she got arrested?

05:32.178 --> 05:33.422
Not really.

05:33.997 --> 05:35.840
She just said that
she got into a fight

05:35.841 --> 05:37.975
with one of her old foster dads.

05:37.976 --> 05:39.424
The night of the homecoming dance.

05:39.425 --> 05:41.520
That's all I really know.

05:41.521 --> 05:42.951
Weren't you with her that night?

05:43.404 --> 05:44.964
She took off without me.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.501
I got stuck with Sam, remember?

05:47.502 --> 05:49.041
Speaking of Sam...

05:49.042 --> 05:50.705
Don't worry about him.

05:50.706 --> 05:51.666
Lux, he knows about us.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.751
I mean, what if he says something?
I will handle Sam.

05:54.752 --> 05:56.567
Okay? I will.

05:56.568 --> 05:58.238
I just...

05:59.014 --> 06:00.318
I'm really happy to see you.

06:00.319 --> 06:03.067
Can we not talk
about Sam and Tasha?

06:03.666 --> 06:05.608
What do you want to talk about?

06:07.573 --> 06:09.872
I don't want to talk anymore.

06:22.193 --> 06:23.027
Finally.

06:23.028 --> 06:24.056
I have been trying to call you.

06:24.057 --> 06:25.158
What is the point of having a

06:25.159 --> 06:26.709
cell phone if you *** lawyer.

06:26.710 --> 06:27.924
Wait, what's going on?
What happened?

06:27.925 --> 06:29.650
Trey made a statement
to the police.

06:29.651 --> 06:32.234
The DA is charging
Tasha with assault.

06:32.235 --> 06:33.875
What does that mean?

06:33.876 --> 06:34.889
Worse.

06:34.890 --> 06:38.524
Lux, second degree assault
is a measure 11 crime,

06:38.525 --> 06:41.125
which means that Tasha
could be tried as an adult.

06:41.126 --> 06:42.759
If she's found guilty, it's a

06:42.760 --> 06:45.265
minimum of six years.

06:45.266 --> 06:48.039
I will set up an
appointment with Tasha

06:48.040 --> 06:49.376
and a state-appointed lawyer.

06:49.377 --> 06:51.629
No, an underpaid,
overworked public defender?

06:51.630 --> 06:53.876
No way. We will get
Tasha a real lawyer.

06:53.877 --> 06:55.551
I think that's best.

06:55.552 --> 06:58.337
Tasha's going to need all
the help she can get.

06:58.338 --> 07:00.437
Lux...

07:07.874 --> 07:13.466
I-I know something
that might help Tasha.

07:37.434 --> 07:39.691
So this-this trey guy, he hit you?

07:39.692 --> 07:41.936
And he shoved you, he shoved
you down a flight of stairs?

07:41.937 --> 07:43.900
Saying it over and over
again doesn't change it.

07:43.901 --> 07:45.334
That's why she had that stroke

07:45.335 --> 07:46.734
that caused all
that learning stuff.

07:46.735 --> 07:48.315
Tasha, stop.

07:48.316 --> 07:50.441
No, sweetie. All of this connects.

07:50.442 --> 07:52.592
So it's important you tell
us exactly what happened.

07:52.593 --> 07:54.160
You know what, fern is right.

07:54.161 --> 07:56.013
We need you to tell us the truth.

07:56.014 --> 07:57.204
We need you to tell us everything.

07:57.205 --> 07:58.608
That way, we can get you help

07:58.609 --> 07:59.448
and get you support.

07:59.449 --> 08:00.539
I don't need support.

08:00.540 --> 08:01.820
We could do something.

08:01.821 --> 08:02.867
We have to do something.

08:02.868 --> 08:05.419
I don't want you to do anything.

08:05.420 --> 08:07.215
Nothing you do can
change what happened.

08:07.216 --> 08:10.208
All I want you to do is figure
out a way to help Tasha.

08:14.047 --> 08:16.751
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

08:16.752 --> 08:18.258
Getting someone to
return my phone call

08:18.259 --> 08:19.859
the day after Thanksgiving
is about as much fun

08:19.860 --> 08:22.027
as going to a mall the
day after Thanksgiving.

08:22.028 --> 08:23.420
Well, I'd do anything for Emma...

08:23.421 --> 08:24.983
And Sam. Yeah.

08:24.984 --> 08:27.646
Nick specializes in
defending juveniles.

08:27.647 --> 08:30.530
Sam actually made a
statement on Tasha

08:30.531 --> 08:31.198
yeah.

08:31.199 --> 08:33.994
He was the other witness
besides Lux. Okay.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.028
I'll get it.

08:41.562 --> 08:42.476
Emma.

08:43.251 --> 08:44.135
What do you want?

08:44.136 --> 08:44.985
You come by to threaten to take

08:44.986 --> 08:46.071
away my job again

08:46.072 --> 08:48.510
thought we should talk about
what happened at Thanksgiving.

08:48.511 --> 08:49.634
I don't have any time to talk.

08:49.635 --> 08:52.733
I'm right in the middle of something.
What's going on?

08:52.734 --> 08:54.145
None of your business.

08:54.146 --> 08:55.381
Come on, Nate, we're family.

08:55.382 --> 08:58.491
If something's happening,
I want to help.

08:58.492 --> 08:59.639
You want to help? Yeah.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.977
Well, Emma's helping me.

09:00.978 --> 09:02.949
Now, you're the one who
made me choose, remember?

09:02.950 --> 09:05.515
So, she's my family now.

09:07.374 --> 09:08.459
Okay.

09:14.444 --> 09:16.140
So, what now?

09:16.141 --> 09:17.134
Where do we go from here?

09:17.135 --> 09:18.409
Well, first things first.

09:18.410 --> 09:20.894
Tasha's jurisdictional hearing
has been scheduled, correct?

09:20.895 --> 09:21.685
Yeah, for Monday,

09:21.686 --> 09:22.480
in juvenile court.

09:22.481 --> 09:24.444
But we're not even sure
what the hearing entails.

09:24.445 --> 09:26.245
It's essentially a trial.

09:26.246 --> 09:27.726
Now, if Tasha's found guilty,

09:27.727 --> 09:28.450
the judge will determine

09:28.451 --> 09:31.239
if she should be sentenced
as a minor or an adult.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.481
And how does the
judge decide that?

09:33.482 --> 09:35.497
It depends on the
seriousness of the crime.

09:35.498 --> 09:36.506
That's why it's important

09:36.507 --> 09:39.220
to show that Tasha's
actions were justified.

09:39.221 --> 09:40.880
Well, they were.
She was defending me.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.856
That's not what trey says here,
in his report to the police.

09:43.857 --> 09:44.867
According to him,

09:44.868 --> 09:46.492
the two of you refused
to leave his property,

09:46.493 --> 09:48.834
and when he tried to make you,
Tasha attacked him.

09:48.835 --> 09:50.489
Yeah, but that's not true.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.532
Be that as it may,

09:51.533 --> 09:53.671
he took a shovel to the head.

09:53.672 --> 09:56.008
Now, trey, on the witness stand,

09:56.009 --> 09:57.881
testifying, with his injuries,

09:57.882 --> 09:59.048
it's going to be compelling.

09:59.049 --> 10:00.310
That's why it's very important

10:00.311 --> 10:01.683
what you say on the stand.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.216
And the prosecution,
they're gonna try

10:03.217 --> 10:04.898
to cast doubt on your testimony,

10:04.899 --> 10:07.013
so you need to be prepared
to give every detail

10:07.014 --> 10:08.051
of your time in their house.

10:08.052 --> 10:09.753
Exactly. Get it on the record.

10:09.754 --> 10:11.879
It'll help when we sue the
hell out of trey later, right?

10:11.880 --> 10:13.398
What? Who's talking
about suing him?

10:13.399 --> 10:17.852
I am. This guy is going to
pay for what he did to you.

10:19.111 --> 10:20.128
Now, don't worry, kiddo.

10:20.129 --> 10:22.586
One way or another, the truth
about this guy is coming out.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.030
Stay out of that bar, Leonard.

10:39.307 --> 10:41.371
What the hell are you doing here?

10:41.372 --> 10:43.695
I came here to talk to you.

10:43.696 --> 10:45.173
Where's your friend?

10:45.174 --> 10:46.639
At home.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.722
Cleaning her shovel.

10:49.146 --> 10:50.108
Yeah?

10:50.936 --> 10:53.521
Well, we'll see how tough
she is when she's in jail.

10:54.761 --> 10:56.108
About that.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.027
Tasha's hearing is on Monday,

10:59.028 --> 11:01.529
and I don't think that
you want to testify,

11:01.530 --> 11:03.146
because I don't
think that you want

11:03.147 --> 11:07.380
what happened in the
past to come out.

11:08.006 --> 11:10.860
So, if you don't testify,

11:10.861 --> 11:13.416
I'll make sure that it doesn't.

11:22.499 --> 11:25.270
You don't forget tomorrow.

11:25.271 --> 11:25.940
No, no.

11:25.941 --> 11:27.550
They couldn't fit
us in till Monday.

11:27.551 --> 11:29.465
Ah, but you're looking
at a local celebrity.

11:29.466 --> 11:30.132
I got pull.

11:32.264 --> 11:33.123
Cate?

11:33.498 --> 11:35.096
I need to talk to you.

11:43.693 --> 11:45.252
I lied...

11:45.253 --> 11:48.319
About trey hitting me.
It never happened.

11:48.697 --> 11:49.234
What?

11:49.484 --> 11:50.836
I made it up because I thought

11:50.837 --> 11:52.087
that it would help Tasha's case.

11:52.088 --> 11:55.956
And I didn't want you
to know the real truth.

11:57.339 --> 12:00.624
What Valerie said... was true.

12:00.625 --> 12:03.091
I was the violent one.

12:06.952 --> 12:10.270
Lux, I... I don't believe you.

12:14.610 --> 12:15.637
I know you.

12:16.756 --> 12:18.264
No, you don't.

12:19.050 --> 12:21.987
Valerie was right, okay, Cate?

12:21.988 --> 12:24.141
I'm-I'm, I'm a liar.

12:24.373 --> 12:25.957
I told you a while back that I'm

12:25.958 --> 12:27.859
more messed up th

12:28.510 --> 12:30.618
if you really knew me...

12:32.009 --> 12:33.707
You'd know that.

12:46.104 --> 12:47.861
You think we're gonna
be able to see the baby?

12:47.862 --> 12:49.300
I wonder what it's
gonna look like.

12:49.301 --> 12:53.621
It's gonna look like a blob
of cells in a gestational sac.

12:54.278 --> 12:56.538
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

12:57.262 --> 12:58.775
Just with everything
that's going on with Lux,

12:58.776 --> 13:00.006
I don't really feel like prime

13:00.007 --> 13:01.249
mother material.
It isn't your fault.

13:01.250 --> 13:04.427
With Lux and trey
isn't your fault.

13:04.428 --> 13:05.894
Yes, it is.

13:06.949 --> 13:08.282
And we don't even
know what happened.

13:08.283 --> 13:10.515
It's like every ten minutes,
she changes her story.

13:10.516 --> 13:12.556
Maybe it's the one
blessing in him testifying;

13:12.557 --> 13:14.406
we finally get to hear the truth.

13:14.407 --> 13:15.918
But he isn't.

13:15.919 --> 13:17.310
He isn't testifying.

13:17.311 --> 13:18.183
What?!

13:18.184 --> 13:20.110
Yeah, Nick e-mailed
me this morning.

13:24.173 --> 13:27.220
What? What's wrong?

13:27.473 --> 13:30.208
I don't know;
I mean, it's a little weird.

13:30.209 --> 13:31.531
Last night the lawyer said

13:31.532 --> 13:33.844
how bad it was that trey
was testifying. Uh-huh.

13:33.845 --> 13:35.564
And now, all of a sudden,
he isn't.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.138
And Lux, she made it a big deal

13:37.139 --> 13:38.740
to tell you how he hit her,

13:38.741 --> 13:40.816
and then she's taking it all back?

13:40.817 --> 13:42.785
Are you saying the two
things could be related?

13:42.786 --> 13:46.261
That Lux and trey
talked or something?

13:48.403 --> 13:50.688
You know what? We should go.
We should just go.

13:50.689 --> 13:51.851
What about the appointment?

13:51.852 --> 13:53.200
Our baby will still
be here tomorrow.

13:53.201 --> 13:55.209
I just want to make
sure that Lux still is.

13:59.269 --> 14:00.732
Baze, hey, it's me.

14:00.733 --> 14:02.373
Ryan has a theory.

14:04.754 --> 14:08.542
Hey, Nate, I heard
about what's going on.

14:08.543 --> 14:09.851
I know you don't want my help,

14:09.852 --> 14:11.407
but I've got a friend
who's a circuit judge.

14:11.408 --> 14:13.674
Leave me alone.
Nate, listen to me.

14:13.675 --> 14:15.766
He might have useful
insight into Tasha's case.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.992
This isn't just about Tasha.

14:17.993 --> 14:19.799
The guy that Tasha
assaulted, okay?

14:19.800 --> 14:22.438
Turns out that he used
to be Lux's foster dad

14:22.439 --> 14:24.030
who hit her, okay?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.516
And there is nothing I
can do about about it now

14:25.517 --> 14:27.241
because she is denying
that it happened.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.782
And the only reason I can think

14:28.783 --> 14:30.120
is that he got to
her or something,

14:30.121 --> 14:31.387
but she's still afraid of him.

14:31.388 --> 14:33.555
Let's go back inside.
Let's talk about this.

14:33.556 --> 14:35.683
I don't want to talk about this,

14:35.684 --> 14:36.525
especially to you.

14:36.526 --> 14:38.842
I want to find this guy
and beat his head in.

14:38.843 --> 14:40.964
Going to talk to a state
witness before a trial

14:40.965 --> 14:42.500
is not a good idea!

14:42.501 --> 14:44.446
I already told you I
don't need your advice.

14:44.447 --> 14:45.865
Nate, whatever
you're going through,

14:45.866 --> 14:47.556
this isn't gonna fix it.

14:47.557 --> 14:51.132
More violence is not
gonna help Lux or Tasha.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.568
Hey. Hey.

15:32.916 --> 15:33.746
I'm figuring out

15:33.747 --> 15:35.698
what to wear to court tomorrow.

15:37.092 --> 15:40.821
Which one makes me look
less like a violent felon?

15:41.351 --> 15:42.562
The dress.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.415
Although it may not matter.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.884
Apparently, trey isn't testifying.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.001
What?! No way.

15:52.074 --> 15:54.194
What's the matter?
That's great news.

15:54.195 --> 15:55.044
It is.

15:55.045 --> 15:57.319
Although Lux is now saying
that he never hit her.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.762
That she just made
it up to protect you.

15:59.763 --> 16:02.013
What? That's not, that's not true.

16:02.014 --> 16:03.423
I know, but if she
doesn't tell the truth,

16:03.424 --> 16:06.206
it's gonna be your
word against the DA's.

16:06.673 --> 16:08.032
Look, I don't know
what's going on,

16:08.033 --> 16:09.113
but if there is one person

16:09.114 --> 16:12.512
that Lux would want to protect,
it would be you.

16:24.422 --> 16:26.744
Why are we watching this?

16:26.745 --> 16:27.979
'Cause you seemed stressed.

16:27.980 --> 16:29.838
I thought a scary
movie might help.

16:30.637 --> 16:33.795
This monster's about as scary
as grimace and the hamburglar.

16:33.796 --> 16:35.995
And it's making me crave fries.

16:38.569 --> 16:39.559
Tasha?

16:39.560 --> 16:41.157
Now you're not gonna say
what really happened

16:41.158 --> 16:43.490
at the hearing tomorrow?

16:44.804 --> 16:45.872
Um... can we talk
about this later?

16:45.873 --> 16:47.157
Later when, Lux?

16:47.158 --> 16:50.674
When I'm in juvie later? Or worse?

16:50.675 --> 16:51.587
I talked to Cate.

16:51.588 --> 16:53.131
Now you're saying
trey never hit you?

16:53.132 --> 16:54.103
Tasha, shut up!

16:54.104 --> 16:55.652
Who's trey? No one.

16:55.653 --> 16:58.362
Seriously, what is your problem?

16:58.363 --> 17:02.099
You. You are my problem, Lux.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.355
Tasha and I,
we really need to talk.

17:06.356 --> 17:07.747
What's going on?

17:07.748 --> 17:10.090
It, it's fine, okay? I promise.

17:10.092 --> 17:12.194
Can you just go?

17:14.146 --> 17:15.420
Okay.

17:15.713 --> 17:17.489
Sure, if that's what you want.

17:17.598 --> 17:19.983
I'll call you later, I promise.

17:27.997 --> 17:29.293
I can't believe you.

17:30.471 --> 17:33.983
You're supposed to
be my best friend.

17:34.576 --> 17:35.819
Everything that I did,

17:35.820 --> 17:36.920
that was to protect you.

17:36.921 --> 17:39.700
And now you could give a
crap about protecting me.

17:39.701 --> 17:41.217
I am protecting you, okay?

17:41.218 --> 17:43.762
Your lawyer said you would have
a good chance of getting off

17:43.763 --> 17:45.701
if trey didn't testify,
so I made it happen!

17:45.702 --> 17:49.222
I'm facing jail,
Lux! A good chance

17:49.223 --> 17:50.544
is not good enough!

17:50.545 --> 17:51.335
I still need you

17:51.336 --> 17:53.176
to tell your side of the story.

17:53.177 --> 17:56.046
The whole story.

17:57.671 --> 17:59.873
But you can't do that.

18:03.605 --> 18:05.351
It's Mr. Daniels.

18:07.641 --> 18:08.490
That's what you're protecting.

18:08.491 --> 18:10.450
Your stupid relationship with him?

18:10.451 --> 18:11.992
You don't want him
to know the truth?

18:11.993 --> 18:13.465
'Cause why?

18:13.466 --> 18:16.661
Why, Lux? What,
are you ashamed? What is it?!

18:20.053 --> 18:22.931
After all we've been through...

18:22.932 --> 18:25.139
After everything...

18:26.474 --> 18:30.255
I really can't believe
you'd choose him over me.

18:45.028 --> 18:46.262
State your name.

18:46.263 --> 18:47.862
Lux Cassidy.

18:47.863 --> 18:51.398
And your relationship to the
defendant Natasha Siviac?

18:51.399 --> 18:53.036
She's my best friend.

18:53.037 --> 18:54.261
Were you aware that Natasha was

18:54.262 --> 18:57.392
recently fostered by
Valerie and trey Gilbert?

18:57.393 --> 18:58.640
Yes.

18:58.641 --> 19:01.284
Well, according to state records,
you were, too.

19:01.285 --> 19:03.094
How long did you live with them?

19:03.095 --> 19:04.819
Almost two years.

19:05.086 --> 19:06.525
According to Natasha,
it was your idea

19:06.526 --> 19:07.771
to go to the Gilberts that night.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.200
Why? Why did you go?

19:09.201 --> 19:12.093
I wanted to talk to Valerie.

19:12.094 --> 19:13.797
She told Cate a bunch of stuff.

19:13.798 --> 19:16.908
Stuff that wasn't true.
Well, can you,

19:16.909 --> 19:18.771
can you give us an example?

19:19.232 --> 19:20.092
Um...

19:21.468 --> 19:23.526
She said I was a liar,

19:23.975 --> 19:26.223
that Cate couldn't trust me,

19:26.590 --> 19:27.910
that I was violent.

19:28.266 --> 19:29.059
Well, were you?

19:29.060 --> 19:30.580
Objection, your honor. Relevance.

19:30.581 --> 19:31.297
Goes to the character

19:31.298 --> 19:33.824
of the witness. I'll allow it.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.822
Miss Cassidy?

19:43.384 --> 19:44.925
Miss Cassidy?

19:46.995 --> 19:49.720
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
What was the question?

19:49.721 --> 19:52.748
Did you lie or were you violent?

19:53.895 --> 19:56.172
Whatever I did or
didn't do in the past

19:56.173 --> 19:58.371
has nothing to do with what
happened two weeks ago.

19:58.372 --> 20:00.341
Well, then let's go
back to two weeks ago.

20:00.342 --> 20:02.342
Is it true that when Mr.
Gilbert asked you

20:02.343 --> 20:04.411
to leave his property,
you refused?

20:04.412 --> 20:05.918
Yes, but I... so you admit

20:05.919 --> 20:06.883
that you were trespassing.

20:06.884 --> 20:08.139
Mr. Gilbert was within his rights

20:08.140 --> 20:10.552
to remove you from his home.
Within his rights?

20:10.553 --> 20:13.414
He grabbed me by my hair and
wrists and wouldn't let go.

20:13.415 --> 20:14.461
Was he carrying a weapon?

20:14.462 --> 20:15.899
No. Did he hit you?

20:15.900 --> 20:17.312
Not that night.

20:17.313 --> 20:20.626
Exactly. So you're admitting
to this court that Natasha had

20:20.627 --> 20:22.171
no reason to react
with brutal force.

20:22.172 --> 20:23.931
She did! She was protecting me!

20:23.932 --> 20:24.871
Oh.

20:31.613 --> 20:34.552
Tasha was just protecting me

20:35.016 --> 20:38.164
because she knew that
he had hit me before

20:38.165 --> 20:40.491
when I lived with him.

20:40.805 --> 20:43.240
She was afraid he was
gonna hit me again.

20:43.241 --> 20:45.993
But isn't it true that you
made these accusations

20:45.994 --> 20:47.205
against Mr. Gilbert before,

20:47.206 --> 20:49.644
but then you ***.

20:49.645 --> 20:51.116
Yes.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.442
So, first, you said Mr. Gilbert

20:53.443 --> 20:54.368
physically abused you,

20:54.369 --> 20:55.976
and then you said,
"no, he didn't."

20:55.977 --> 20:58.064
But now we're back to
saying that he did.

20:58.065 --> 20:59.509
At least one of those
statements is a lie.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.464
Which one is it?

21:04.608 --> 21:05.915
I guess Ms. Gilbert's assessment

21:05.916 --> 21:08.156
to your mother was accurate.

21:08.606 --> 21:10.614
No more questions, your honor.

21:11.403 --> 21:12.719
Very well.

21:13.077 --> 21:15.812
The court is adjourned
for a 20 minute recess.

21:20.558 --> 21:21.664
Lux...

21:23.345 --> 21:25.137
Lux, will you wait?

21:33.208 --> 21:34.216
You okay?

21:34.448 --> 21:36.031
She won't even talk to me.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.443
You mind if I try?

21:46.032 --> 21:47.021
Hi.

21:48.710 --> 21:50.668
What, what are you doing here?

21:51.099 --> 21:52.452
You never called.

21:52.453 --> 21:54.784
And I was just worried about you.

21:55.623 --> 21:57.297
I looked into Tasha's
arrest and found out

21:57.298 --> 21:59.196
what was really going on.

22:01.578 --> 22:03.251
It was intense in there.

22:03.967 --> 22:05.151
Mm. And what,
your other girlfriends

22:05.152 --> 22:08.054
didn't get hit by their
creep foster dads?

22:09.868 --> 22:11.491
Lux, you could have told me.

22:12.013 --> 22:14.209
I mean, the fact that you've
been going through all this...

22:14.210 --> 22:16.371
I mean, you should
have told me. And what,

22:16.372 --> 22:17.704
give you another excuse to say

22:17.705 --> 22:19.974
that we can't do this again?

22:22.889 --> 22:26.344
Look, if you knew that
this was happening,

22:26.597 --> 22:28.590
what had happened before...

22:29.256 --> 22:29.972
What?

22:29.973 --> 22:31.397
You'd bail.

22:34.832 --> 22:36.251
I'm here.

22:37.235 --> 22:39.080
All right? I'm not bailing.

22:39.586 --> 22:40.928
Nothing you say on that stand

22:40.929 --> 22:44.369
is going to change how anyone
in that room feels about you.

22:44.912 --> 22:46.518
Or how I feel.

22:48.061 --> 22:50.224
I mean, everyone's here
'cause they love you.

22:51.726 --> 22:53.159
Including me.

22:56.857 --> 22:58.073
What?

22:58.812 --> 23:00.730
I love you, Lux.

23:02.371 --> 23:04.329
I'm not going anywhere.

23:04.570 --> 23:05.565
I'm here.

23:05.566 --> 23:08.867
So you don't have to
be scared of anything.

23:09.402 --> 23:11.736
Go back in there and
tell them the truth.

23:13.409 --> 23:17.422
For Tasha... and for you.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.807
The defense calls Lux
Cassidy back to the stand.

23:33.118 --> 23:35.023
There seems to be
a lot of confusion

23:35.024 --> 23:37.096
about what happened between
you and trey Gilbert

23:37.097 --> 23:39.211
during the time you
lived in his house.

23:39.651 --> 23:41.813
Did trey Gilbert hit you?

23:42.815 --> 23:43.914
Yes.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.900
Uh, according to Mr.
Gilbert's statement,

23:45.901 --> 23:48.319
he claims you hit him.

23:48.832 --> 23:50.220
Is this claim true?

23:50.641 --> 23:52.056
It's true.

23:53.773 --> 23:55.592
And why would you hit him?

24:06.127 --> 24:07.308
Because I was afraid

24:07.309 --> 24:09.657
he was going to force
me to have sex with him.

24:09.658 --> 24:11.155
That's a lie!

24:11.156 --> 24:13.313
Mr. Gilbert, sit down!

24:13.314 --> 24:15.448
Objection, your honor.
This is clearly a fabrication.

24:15.449 --> 24:16.890
We know based on
what's already happened

24:16.891 --> 24:18.757
that miss Cassidy
changes her story

24:18.758 --> 24:20.233
to whatever is most convenient.

24:20.234 --> 24:21.455
Overruled.

24:21.456 --> 24:25.699
Another word, and I'll hold
you in contempt of court.

24:29.505 --> 24:32.016
Miss Cassidy, continue.

24:37.587 --> 24:39.134
Most girls

24:39.980 --> 24:40.900
in junior high,

24:41.117 --> 24:44.812
they have their first kiss playing
"spin the bottle."

24:47.553 --> 24:49.136
Mine was with him.

24:52.130 --> 24:53.985
So was my second.

24:54.745 --> 24:56.283
And my third.

25:00.487 --> 25:01.558
He...

25:03.385 --> 25:05.077
He forced me.

25:06.509 --> 25:08.009
He intimidated me.

25:09.696 --> 25:12.102
He said if I said anything,
that my mom...

25:17.077 --> 25:20.520
Valerie would send
me back to Sunnyvale.

25:23.477 --> 25:25.538
And I wanted to be with her.

25:27.450 --> 25:28.868
More than anything.

25:30.067 --> 25:31.633
With Valerie.

25:36.026 --> 25:38.205
So, to be with her,
I had to be with him.

25:46.056 --> 25:47.864
Until that night.

25:49.768 --> 25:53.533
I didn't want to do
what he wanted me to do,

25:54.988 --> 25:57.795
so I... I took the lamp
from the nightstand

25:57.796 --> 26:00.467
and I smashed it over his head.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.767
I ran out screaming
for Valerie, but...

26:06.675 --> 26:10.890
He got me before I made it,
and he hit me.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.499
Threw me down the stairs.

26:15.161 --> 26:17.818
I got knocked unconscious.

26:18.104 --> 26:20.990
That's when I had the
stroke that messed me up.

26:25.248 --> 26:27.168
I told Valerie...

26:28.400 --> 26:31.128
What he had done and
what he had been doing.

26:37.746 --> 26:40.030
But she didn't believe me.

26:40.670 --> 26:42.760
She knew what I knew.

26:43.017 --> 26:44.621
You lied then,
just like you're lying now.

26:44.622 --> 26:46.422
Mr. Gilbert, be quiet!

26:46.423 --> 26:47.639
Because you don't want
these people to know

26:47.640 --> 26:50.020
what kind of girl you really are.

26:51.144 --> 26:51.947
What?

26:52.254 --> 26:53.310
What? It's the truth.

26:54.248 --> 26:55.061
Bailiff!

26:55.325 --> 26:57.100
Bailiff! What? It's the truth.

26:57.715 --> 27:00.107
Take your seats!

27:01.634 --> 27:02.542
Bailiff!

27:05.984 --> 27:09.409
Everyone, take your seats!

27:16.950 --> 27:18.197
H you know, you're lucky the judge

27:18.198 --> 27:20.253
let you off with how you could b

27:20.719 --> 27:22.583
I thought more violence
wasn't the answer.

27:22.584 --> 27:24.364
Yeah, sometimes it's
the only answer.

27:26.578 --> 27:28.580
I was going to ask
if you were okay,

27:29.312 --> 27:30.732
but I don't know how you could be.

27:30.733 --> 27:33.048
I just... you know,
I want to fix it.

27:33.943 --> 27:35.095
I'm her dad.

27:35.096 --> 27:37.497
That's what dads do...
they fix things.

27:37.913 --> 27:40.153
Parents can't always
fix things, Nate.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.962
Sometimes all you can do
is show up and be there.

27:48.165 --> 27:50.289
Whatever kind of
support I can give,

27:51.471 --> 27:53.340
I want to give it.

27:55.469 --> 27:57.879
Even if I'm dating Emma?

27:58.718 --> 27:59.719
Because I love her, dad,

27:59.720 --> 28:01.757
and that isn't changing.

28:04.479 --> 28:07.705
Either way, I'm here.

28:16.342 --> 28:19.559
The worst isn't what trey did.

28:21.062 --> 28:23.409
What hurt the most was Valerie.

28:24.692 --> 28:25.789
She just believed

28:25.790 --> 28:28.046
whatever she wanted to believe,

28:29.243 --> 28:30.565
and it wasn't me.

28:30.566 --> 28:32.413
Lux, I had no idea.

28:35.482 --> 28:39.815
She said that she was going
to be my mom forever.

28:41.467 --> 28:43.060
That I was her daughter.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.583
And she just threw me away.

28:49.079 --> 28:52.973
I think that's what
really wrecked me.

28:54.540 --> 28:58.115
She chose him over me.

28:59.415 --> 29:01.153
Why didn't you tell me?

29:01.437 --> 29:03.538
I mean, no, no, no.

29:03.539 --> 29:05.579
I know why you didn't tell me.

29:08.128 --> 29:10.433
But you know you
could have, right?

29:11.463 --> 29:14.092
I just... I...

29:14.432 --> 29:16.725
I didn't want to risk it again.

29:17.113 --> 29:18.739
Risk what?

29:19.144 --> 29:20.887
Telling the truth

29:21.122 --> 29:23.815
and having another
mom not believe me.

29:23.816 --> 29:24.953
I just...

29:25.238 --> 29:30.140
I don't think I could
take losing another mom.

29:32.793 --> 29:35.389
I can't take losing you.

29:35.674 --> 29:38.227
Oh, my God. Kid...

29:38.536 --> 29:39.857
Listen to me.

29:40.833 --> 29:44.301
I am here, and I am
not going anywhere.

29:44.302 --> 29:47.685
Okay? You have to really know that,
you have to hear it.

29:51.385 --> 29:54.149
You couldn't lose me if you tried.

30:15.417 --> 30:17.295
We need to talk.

30:17.296 --> 30:19.213
Cate, we can't. Look, Valerie,

30:19.214 --> 30:21.241
you and I, we are the same.

30:21.242 --> 30:22.209
When I gave up Lux,

30:22.210 --> 30:24.976
I told myself that it
was for her own good.

30:24.977 --> 30:27.168
I-I convinced myself
that that was the truth,

30:27.169 --> 30:29.601
that she would have this
better life without me,

30:29.602 --> 30:31.571
because that was a story
that I could live with.

30:31.572 --> 30:34.709
And I think that you've
told yourself a story, too.

30:35.758 --> 30:37.481
You've told yourself
that the problem

30:37.482 --> 30:39.279
is Lux.

30:39.787 --> 30:41.959
And I get why you don't
want to believe her.

30:42.456 --> 30:43.476
You know it meant believing

30:43.477 --> 30:46.107
that your husband is a sick,
sick man.

30:46.780 --> 30:47.589
Right? It pulls a thread

30:47.590 --> 30:50.038
that pulls your entire life apart.

30:53.098 --> 30:55.280
But you know Lux...

30:55.546 --> 30:57.599
And you know the truth.

31:00.422 --> 31:02.095
Look, being a parent,

31:02.096 --> 31:04.712
it means putting your kid first.

31:05.813 --> 31:07.864
And you were her mom once.

31:09.081 --> 31:11.260
Be her mom again.

31:40.796 --> 31:42.247
Where's Valerie? What happened?

31:42.248 --> 31:43.219
Did she leave?

31:43.220 --> 31:44.738
Uh, I'm not sure.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.341
The judge called the prosecutor

31:46.342 --> 31:49.581
and the defense lawyers
into chambers a while ago.

31:55.305 --> 31:57.078
All rise.

32:01.262 --> 32:03.941
There has been a new development.

32:04.678 --> 32:06.859
As I have just informed counsel...

32:07.858 --> 32:10.612
...Valerie Gilbert has
come forward privately

32:10.838 --> 32:14.470
and corroborated the
testimony of Lux Cassidy.

32:14.471 --> 32:18.032
Now, in light of that,
I find that Natasha Siviac

32:18.033 --> 32:21.800
held reasonable belief
that trey Gilbert was

32:21.801 --> 32:24.146
an imminent physical threat,

32:24.147 --> 32:26.218
and that Natasha
Siviac's use of force

32:26.219 --> 32:28.055
against him,
in defense of her friend,

32:28.056 --> 32:30.212
is justified.

32:30.643 --> 32:32.800
I see no reason to
prolong this hearing.

32:32.801 --> 32:35.089
Does the state have
any objections?

32:35.090 --> 32:36.980
We do not, your honor.

32:37.178 --> 32:39.041
Then the state's petition
against the minor,

32:39.042 --> 32:41.344
Natasha Siviac, on the count

32:41.345 --> 32:44.096
of assault in the second degree

32:44.097 --> 32:46.495
is hereby dismissed.

32:49.868 --> 32:50.962
However...

32:51.311 --> 32:53.884
The court is sustaining
the lesser counts.

32:53.885 --> 32:56.418
Violating the terms of
your independent living,

32:56.419 --> 32:57.975
missing curfew,

32:57.976 --> 33:01.139
and trespassing on
private property.

33:01.453 --> 33:06.288
I am recommending the
minimum punishment

33:06.289 --> 33:09.067
two months in a juvenile
offender facility,

33:09.068 --> 33:10.901
which will require that you stay

33:10.902 --> 33:14.350
in a secured school
and attend counseling.

33:14.351 --> 33:19.572
After that, you are free to
return to independent living.

33:21.218 --> 33:23.925
This court is adjourned.

33:38.439 --> 33:41.184
Hey. So, what's going on there?

33:41.185 --> 33:43.603
The DA's pressing
charges against trey.

33:43.604 --> 33:46.602
With Valerie's testimony,
he's facing jail time.

33:46.603 --> 33:47.246
Yeah.

33:47.956 --> 33:49.195
Thank you, fern.

33:49.623 --> 33:50.936
Lux...

33:55.547 --> 33:57.519
I am so sorry.

33:58.897 --> 34:00.098
It's okay.

34:01.229 --> 34:04.002
No. It's not.

34:06.862 --> 34:08.833
But I'm glad that you are.

34:18.837 --> 34:20.418
Oh, thanks for being here.

34:20.418 --> 34:22.697
It has meant so much to all of us.

34:23.092 --> 34:23.905
Yeah.

34:32.647 --> 34:34.291
Thanks for everything.

34:35.103 --> 34:37.063
Nothing's changed, right?

34:37.235 --> 34:38.246
With us?

34:38.427 --> 34:40.706
No, no. Nothing's changed.

35:19.547 --> 35:20.721
Go ahead.

35:32.813 --> 35:34.032
Valerie?

35:35.848 --> 35:37.206
Lux, hi.

35:39.785 --> 35:42.353
I, uh... I wanted to say...

35:43.876 --> 35:45.298
Thank you.

35:46.947 --> 35:50.354
Thank you for what
you did in there.

35:53.216 --> 35:56.114
And for what you didn't
do four years ago.

35:57.568 --> 35:59.314
Thank you for not believing me.

36:00.864 --> 36:04.764
Because if you had, I never
would have left your house.

36:05.271 --> 36:07.338
I never would have decided
to get emancipated.

36:07.339 --> 36:11.394
I never would have
found Cate and Baze.

36:13.976 --> 36:15.433
So thank you...

36:16.785 --> 36:21.656
...For not acting like
anything close to a mom.

36:24.345 --> 36:26.767
'Cause that's what
lead me back to mine.

36:43.059 --> 36:44.899
Don't worry. At this early stage,

36:44.900 --> 36:47.916
it sometimes takes a
while to find the fetus.

36:47.917 --> 36:50.579
Oh, see that?

36:51.919 --> 36:53.419
Oh, my God.

36:53.717 --> 36:55.274
It's so tiny.

36:55.275 --> 36:57.640
It's about the size
of a blueberry.

36:57.928 --> 36:58.921
That's your baby.

36:58.922 --> 36:59.758
Wow.

37:00.303 --> 37:02.079
Hey, I think it has your nose.

37:02.978 --> 37:04.374
It may not be a nose.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.616
We can't tell the sex quite yet.

37:06.617 --> 37:08.532
You keep doing what you're doing...

37:08.533 --> 37:10.360
taking good care of your baby.

37:10.361 --> 37:11.894
I will.

37:23.029 --> 37:24.947
Hey!

37:25.955 --> 37:27.762
So, what did the doctor say?

37:27.763 --> 37:30.023
We are having a blueberry!

37:30.541 --> 37:31.836
That's awesome

37:32.529 --> 37:34.258
Baze went all out, huh?

37:34.542 --> 37:37.433
My last night of
freedom for two months.

37:37.795 --> 37:40.158
I can't believe I have to leave
first thing in the morning.

37:40.159 --> 37:41.984
Tash, I'm sorry.

37:42.315 --> 37:44.262
And I'm sorry for
ever letting you think

37:44.263 --> 37:47.402
that I would choose
anyone over you.

37:49.359 --> 37:50.654
You know, it wasn't...

37:51.103 --> 37:52.460
Look, it wasn't about Eric.

37:52.703 --> 37:54.419
It was just me being ashamed

37:54.420 --> 37:56.571
of my screwed-up past.

37:56.950 --> 37:58.561
I get it. I do.

37:58.845 --> 38:01.068
And I knew it was bad.

38:01.375 --> 38:03.598
But not that bad.

38:05.025 --> 38:06.833
And the only thing I'm sorry for

38:06.834 --> 38:09.427
is that I only hit
that bastard once.

38:10.268 --> 38:12.209
I don't know how
I'll ever repay you.

38:12.389 --> 38:13.124
Well...

38:13.419 --> 38:16.438
You can grab me, like,
a wad of singles,

38:16.439 --> 38:19.367
um, some cigarettes,
a case of soda.

38:19.368 --> 38:21.470
It's like hard currency in juvie.

38:21.471 --> 38:23.623
Well, I think there might
be a case of soda downstairs

38:23.624 --> 38:25.590
with your name on it. Yes!

38:25.591 --> 38:26.502
If you don't mind

38:26.503 --> 38:28.316
that the cans are charred. No.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.356
Here you go. Just one glass.

38:31.357 --> 38:33.087
Nate, you got any more?

38:33.088 --> 38:34.370
Uh, downstairs on the bar.

38:34.371 --> 38:35.172
I'll grab it.

38:35.173 --> 38:37.308
Hold on a second.
We're toasting. Okay.

38:37.309 --> 38:40.936
Um, okay. A little
agua for the baby mama.

38:40.937 --> 38:42.991
Ooh. What are we toasting?
What aren't we toasting?

38:42.992 --> 38:44.785
We got everybody?
We got everybody.

38:44.786 --> 38:46.308
Um, to Tasha,

38:46.309 --> 38:49.374
who... thank God... is not going
to a federal penitentiary.

38:49.375 --> 38:52.129
Although you would've
rocked the orange jumpsuit.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.516
Thank you.

38:54.265 --> 38:57.408
To Cate and Ryan.

38:57.409 --> 38:59.311
And the blueberry.

39:01.016 --> 39:03.144
And to Lux,
who is entirely to blame

39:03.145 --> 39:05.376
for all of this.
I mean, if you hadn't shown up

39:05.377 --> 39:07.717
on my doorstep in that little
"don't bug me" shirt

39:07.718 --> 39:10.296
and straight-jacketed me
with fatherly responsibility,

39:10.297 --> 39:12.654
I wouldn't have had to
get my act together.

39:12.655 --> 39:14.056
I would have never
had a real career,

39:14.057 --> 39:15.672
a real relationship...

39:15.673 --> 39:17.595
No, I would be here,
trying to smoke

39:17.596 --> 39:21.001
out of a bong-lamp,
eating turkey jerky in my boxers.

39:21.002 --> 39:21.871
Mm.

39:23.972 --> 39:26.827
So, let's all raise a glass

39:27.405 --> 39:29.992
to the reason that we
are all here together.

39:31.722 --> 39:35.303
To the best thing that could
have happened to all of us.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.444
We're crazy. We're unconventional.

39:39.445 --> 39:41.443
We're often inappropriate.

39:42.188 --> 39:43.975
But no matter what,

39:45.128 --> 39:46.911
we're your family.

39:50.684 --> 39:51.715
To Lux.

39:52.038 --> 39:53.174
To Lux.

39:53.494 --> 39:54.618
Love you, kiddo.

39:54.903 --> 39:55.800
Cheers.

39:56.077 --> 39:57.128
Bottoms up.

39:57.531 --> 39:59.383
Hey, long-distance clinking.

39:59.573 --> 40:00.987
Clink. Clink.

40:03.835 --> 40:04.445
Hey.

40:04.446 --> 40:05.244
Hey.

40:05.610 --> 40:07.625
Uh, if you could hurry
up with the champagne.

40:07.869 --> 40:08.791
Since Cate's not drinking,

40:08.792 --> 40:10.947
she's force feeding Cate get along.

40:10.948 --> 40:13.219
Wow. You're as controlling
here as you are at work.

40:14.678 --> 40:16.291
It's nice you and Cate get along.

40:16.743 --> 40:18.577
I'm surprised there's
not some jealousy.

40:19.742 --> 40:22.239
Well, you know, most people who
are jealous rarely admit it.

40:23.138 --> 40:24.222
Jealous?

40:27.429 --> 40:28.197
No, no.

40:28.198 --> 40:30.466
I'm not jealous of you and Nate.

40:30.467 --> 40:33.086
Questioning your motives
for dating my son? Yes.

40:33.087 --> 40:35.064
Questioning your integrity...

40:37.626 --> 40:40.318
You know, I wouldn't
question my integrity.

40:40.319 --> 40:40.935
No?

40:41.473 --> 40:42.938
No. I'm the one

40:42.939 --> 40:45.663
who told you what was going
on with Lux and Tasha.

40:45.664 --> 40:48.274
I'm the reason you were
at that courthouse today,

40:48.275 --> 40:50.515
that you and Nate are
back in a good place.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.706
And last I checked,

40:52.707 --> 40:55.501
I'm not the one who cheated
on my wife with my employee,

40:55.502 --> 40:59.191
and made promises he had
no intention of keeping.

41:03.617 --> 41:04.596
Well...

41:07.076 --> 41:08.724
What happened in the past

41:10.621 --> 41:12.274
is the past.
