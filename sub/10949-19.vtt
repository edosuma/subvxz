14:10.300 --> 14:12.430
but this isn't about you.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.340
This is about the world.

14:14.470 --> 14:16.800
But the monks taught me,
that I have to detach myself

14:16.930 --> 14:19.180
from the world so my spirit could be free.

14:19.430 --> 14:23.100
Many great and wise Air Nomads
have detached themselves

14:23.230 --> 14:25.980
and achieved spiritual enlightenment.

14:26.110 --> 14:28.270
But the Avatar can never do it,

14:28.400 --> 14:31.900
because your sole duty is to the world.

14:32.030 --> 14:34.700
Here is my wisdom for you...

14:35.200 --> 14:37.580
Selfless duty calls you to sacrifice

14:37.700 --> 14:39.950
your own spiritual needs

14:40.080 --> 14:44.250
and do whatever it takes
to protect the world.

14:46.710 --> 14:49.340
( CHATTERING )

14:49.460 --> 14:51.300
I guess I don't have a choice, Momo.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.970
I have to kill the Fire Lord.

15:05.390 --> 15:07.360
( YAWNING )

15:12.030 --> 15:17.780
Uncle, I know you must have
mixed feelings about seeing me.

15:17.910 --> 15:22.660
But I want you to know
I am so, so sorry, Uncle.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.330
I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did.

15:26.460 --> 15:29.420
I don't know how I can ever
make it up to you, but I―

15:35.550 --> 15:37.760
How can you forgive me so easily?

15:37.890 --> 15:39.640
I thought you would be furious with me.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.220
I was never angry with you.

15:43.350 --> 15:47.940
I was sad, because I was
afraid you'd lost your way.

15:48.060 --> 15:50.820
I did lose my way.

15:50.940 --> 15:54.490
But you've found it again...

15:55.280 --> 15:58.070
And you did it by yourself,

15:58.200 --> 16:02.290
and I am so happy you found your way here.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.580
It wasn't that hard, Uncle.

16:05.710 --> 16:07.790
You have a pretty strong scent.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.540
( SQUEAKS )

16:11.000 --> 16:12.710
( BIRDS CALLING )

( YAWNS )

16:18.510 --> 16:20.260
( RUMBLING CONTINUES )

16:20.340 --> 16:24.430
Wait, is it just me or are
those mountains getting bigger?

16:24.680 --> 16:26.350
( CHATTERS )

16:35.320 --> 16:37.280
They're not getting larger,
they're getting closer.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.820
( CHATTERS )

16:40.950 --> 16:42.490
The whole island is moving!

( GASPS )

17:08.810 --> 17:10.310
It's amazing, Momo!

17:10.440 --> 17:12.190
The biggest animal in the world!

17:12.310 --> 17:14.610
I've gotta swim around and find its face.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.210
ZUKO: Uncle, you're the only
person other than the Avatar

17:29.330 --> 17:31.960
who can possibly defeat the Father Lord.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.630
You mean the Fire Lord?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.210
That's what I just said.

17:35.340 --> 17:37.210
Hmm...

17:37.340 --> 17:38.970
We need you to come with us.

17:39.590 --> 17:41.050
No, Zuko.

17:41.180 --> 17:42.720
It won't turn out well.

17:43.090 --> 17:45.970
You can beat him
and we'll be there to help.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.520
Even if I did defeat Ozai,

17:48.640 --> 17:51.100
and I don't know that I could,

17:51.230 --> 17:53.940
it would be the wrong way to end a war.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.900
History would see it as just
more senseless violence,

17:58.030 --> 18:01.110
a brother killing a brother to grab power.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.910
The only way
for this war to end peacefully

18:04.030 --> 18:07.700
is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.

18:08.540 --> 18:10.790
And then... Then would you come and take

18:10.910 --> 18:12.500
your rightful place on the throne?

18:13.040 --> 18:16.960
No. Someone new must take the throne...

18:17.090 --> 18:22.550
An idealist with a pure heart
and unquestionable honor.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.550
It has to be you, Prince Zuko.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.640
Unquestionable honor?

18:27.760 --> 18:29.470
But I've made so many mistakes.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.980
Yes, you have.

18:32.100 --> 18:35.100
You've struggled and you've suffered,

18:35.230 --> 18:37.980
but you have always
followed your own path.

18:38.190 --> 18:40.650
You restored your own honor,

18:40.780 --> 18:45.660
and only you can restore
the honor of the Fire Nation.

18:45.780 --> 18:47.700
I'll try, Uncle.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.620
Well, what if Aang doesn't come back?

18:51.370 --> 18:55.420
Sozin's Comet is arriving
and our destinies are upon us.

18:55.540 --> 18:57.590
Aang will face the Fire Lord.

18:58.790 --> 19:01.340
When I was a boy, I had a vision

19:01.460 --> 19:04.380
that I would one day take Ba Sing Se.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.220
Only now do I see that my destiny

19:07.340 --> 19:10.510
is to take it back from the Fire Nation,

19:10.640 --> 19:14.190
so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.

19:15.020 --> 19:17.940
That's why you gathered
the members of the White Lotus.

19:18.060 --> 19:20.020
Yes.

19:20.150 --> 19:23.440
Zuko, you must return to the Fire Nation,

19:23.570 --> 19:25.530
so that when the Fire Lord falls,

19:25.650 --> 19:30.530
you can assume the throne
and restore peace and order.

19:30.660 --> 19:33.950
But Azula will be there waiting for you.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.830
I can handle Azula.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.340
Not alone. You'll need help.

19:39.460 --> 19:40.840
You're right.

19:40.920 --> 19:44.010
Katara, how would you like to
help me put Azula in her place?

19:44.420 --> 19:46.340
It would be my pleasure.

19:46.470 --> 19:48.970
What about us? What's our destiny today?

19:49.720 --> 19:51.970
What do you think it is?

19:52.100 --> 19:54.850
I think that even though
we don't know where Aang is,

19:54.980 --> 19:57.900
we need to do everything we can
to stop the airship fleet.

19:58.020 --> 20:00.480
And that means, when Aang
does face the Fire Lord,

20:00.610 --> 20:02.860
we'll be right there if he need us.

20:08.660 --> 20:10.200
Nothing runs faster over land

20:10.320 --> 20:12.950
or swims quicker than a giant eel-hound.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.160
The airship base is on a small island

20:15.290 --> 20:17.290
just off the Earth Kingdom shore.

20:17.500 --> 20:21.460
You should be able to intercept the fleet
within a day's journey.

20:21.590 --> 20:23.050
Thank you, master.

20:29.260 --> 20:32.640
So, if I'm gonna be Fire Lord
after the war's over,

20:32.720 --> 20:34.060
what are you gonna do?

20:34.180 --> 20:37.270
After I reconquer Ba Sing Se,

20:37.390 --> 20:40.060
I am going to reconquer my tea shop

20:40.190 --> 20:43.690
and I am going to play Pai Sho every day.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.950
- Goodbye, General Iroh.
- Goodbye, everyone.

20:52.070 --> 20:57.000
Today, destiny is our friend. I know it.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.750
A Lion Turtle.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.460
Maybe you can help me.

21:45.590 --> 21:48.960
Everyone, even my own past lives

21:49.090 --> 21:52.930
are expecting me to end someone's life.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.600
But I don't know if I can do it.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.770
LION TURTLE: <i>The true mind</i>
<i>can weather all the lies</i>

21:57.890 --> 22:01.310

22:01.560 --> 22:04.560
<i>The true heart can tough
the poison of hatred</i>

22:04.690 --> 22:07.110
<i>without being harmed.</i>

22:07.320 --> 22:11.490
<i>Since beginningless time,
darkness thrives in the void,</i>

22:11.610 --> 22:15.240
<i>but always yields to purifying light.</i>

22:25.960 --> 22:27.380
<i>Wait for him.</i>

22:27.500 --> 22:29.260
<i>He will come.</i>

22:40.470 --> 22:44.230
It's time for this world to end in fire

22:44.350 --> 22:48.610
and for a new world
to be born from the ashes.
