WEBVTT

00:02.469 --> 00:03.435
(theme music)

00:46.013 --> 00:47.212
- You know what, george?

00:48.148 --> 00:49.614
I think it's time
we get married.

00:49.683 --> 00:50.982
- Married?

00:51.052 --> 00:52.217
But he can't!

00:52.219 --> 00:53.652
- Now, come give
your father a hug.

00:54.789 --> 00:57.055
- What kind of hold does
that man have on you?

00:57.190 --> 00:58.556
- So, you expect me
to keep your secret?

00:58.592 --> 01:00.425
- I keep yours.
- You're threatening me?

01:00.494 --> 01:02.061
- We've all got secrets, watts.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.430
No one likes having
them exposed.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.470
- Should anyone know
of any reason that this couple

01:11.472 --> 01:14.106
Should not be joined
in holy matrimony,

01:14.241 --> 01:17.409
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.044
(both): You?!

01:20.247 --> 01:21.580
(♪)

01:26.553 --> 01:27.519
- George...

01:28.322 --> 01:29.988
What do you want to do?

01:34.895 --> 01:37.195
- How long are we expected
to stay here?

01:37.231 --> 01:38.530
(door opening)

01:38.665 --> 01:39.865
- Effie's gone home.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.935
I suppose it's safe now
for you to leave, as well.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.973
You don't have anything you
want to say about any of this?

01:53.413 --> 01:55.781
- I'm sorry.
- Hollow words.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.819
She loved you, you know,
and she is my dearest friend.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.522
"I'm sorry" is hardly enough.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.630
- Right then, crabtree.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.098
Let's get out of here.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.736
- I had no choice.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.443
I had no choice.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.512
- You left that poor woman
standing at the altar.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.548
I thought you were a better
man than that, crabtree.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.285
- Is there something you would
like to tell us, george?

02:35.456 --> 02:36.855
Anything at all?

02:38.225 --> 02:39.057
(sighing)

02:46.266 --> 02:47.265
- George?

02:54.108 --> 02:55.007
(door closing)

02:59.947 --> 03:02.948
- We didn't mean it
to be so dramatic.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.550
Oleander and I tried
to get here earlier.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.318
- Why are you apologizing?

03:08.355 --> 03:10.756
We just saved that
young woman's life.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.990
- And destroyed mine.

03:12.125 --> 03:15.093
- If you had married her,
she would have died.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.829
It was foretold.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.702
- I know.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.240
(dog barking and panting)

03:40.454 --> 03:42.120
- Don't be disturbing
that, girl.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.793
(faint knocking)

03:51.131 --> 03:52.764
Good lord. Help!

03:53.701 --> 03:54.733
Anyone. Help!

03:54.802 --> 03:56.234
(dramatic music)

03:56.237 --> 03:57.535
Just a minute more.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.937
We'll get you out!

03:59.006 --> 04:01.139
(grunting)

04:02.676 --> 04:03.841
(wood creaking)

04:06.614 --> 04:07.746
(groaning)
(cracking)

04:09.683 --> 04:11.149
(eerie music)

04:11.285 --> 04:13.551
No, sir. Please! No!

04:13.621 --> 04:14.886
(cracking)

04:19.126 --> 04:20.225
(dog whining)

04:23.163 --> 04:23.962
(whistling)

04:26.567 --> 04:28.500
(eerie music)

04:45.085 --> 04:47.185
- Have the bodies taken
to the morgue, henry.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.720
- Of course, sir.
Although mrs. Hart

04:48.855 --> 04:50.188
Is away until tomorrow morning.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.524
- Are you suggesting we wait?

04:53.260 --> 04:54.459
- Of course not.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.395
Uh, what do you think
happened here, sir?

04:56.397 --> 04:57.863
- I have no idea.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.065
- Someone may be playing
a hoax on us.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.401
- A hoax?
- Well, yes.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.002
They've staged a scene
so to make it appear

05:04.137 --> 05:05.737
That a dead man
committed this crime.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.740
- Let's proceed as though
no one has risen

05:08.776 --> 05:10.475
From the dead for now, henry.

05:11.245 --> 05:12.410
- Very good, sir.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.483
- Thankfully, both men
were without family.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.889
I spoke to one of the other
groundskeepers, sir.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.891
Uh, one of the dead men, lowell
vaz, worked here for six years.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.826
The other, ronan trent,

05:28.862 --> 05:31.029
Took his dog for his daily walk
here every day.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.365
- Oh. Any sign of the dog?

05:33.367 --> 05:35.633
- No, sir.
Ah, three-legged

05:35.669 --> 05:37.102
Homely creature, I'm told.

05:37.771 --> 05:38.936
- Very good, henry.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.706
- Sir. If I may?

05:40.841 --> 05:41.806
- Of course.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.776
- What do you think about
what george did?

05:44.911 --> 05:45.911
- Uh...

05:47.247 --> 05:50.548
I think george left the woman
he loves at the altar.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.185
- Yes. And?

05:53.187 --> 05:56.188
- All of the years that
I have been doing this, henry,

05:56.190 --> 06:00.058
I still don't know the
inner workings of man's mind,

06:00.193 --> 06:02.660
Much less george crabtree's.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.263
- I think he got cold feet.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.133
Staged the whole thing
so he wouldn't have to marry.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.203
- Where might we find
this groundskeeper?

06:12.239 --> 06:13.605
- This way, sir.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.817
- I can't... Apologize
for speaking the truth

06:25.886 --> 06:28.019
To spare a life.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.822
- Are you sure
this was her fate?

06:30.957 --> 06:34.292
- If miss newsome were
to marry you, yes!

06:34.294 --> 06:36.994
- Why?
(laughing)

06:37.965 --> 06:40.098
- I do not know
the answer to that.

06:40.233 --> 06:44.035
I only know... What is to be.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.838
- Your aunt has never
been wrong, george.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.005
You know that.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.774
- But why not tell me earlier,

06:49.810 --> 06:51.109
When we came for a visit?

06:51.111 --> 06:54.079
- The vision had yet
to come to me!

06:54.081 --> 06:57.048
Be thankful it came
to me when it did.

06:57.050 --> 07:00.318
If it had not come, your bride
would be a dead woman!

07:00.320 --> 07:02.187
And your heart would be broken.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.990
- My heart is broken.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.959
- Then go away from here
and let it heal.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.397
Oh, you always were
a sensitive cabbage, george.

07:12.532 --> 07:16.267
But I know you have
a spine of steel.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.402
You will persevere.

07:25.412 --> 07:26.611
(door closing)

07:26.647 --> 07:28.946
- It's not even
consecrated land.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.082
Shouldn't have been anyone
buried over there.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.717
- Well, it seems there was.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.753
- Still, no record of it.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.890
- Do you have a list of the
recent arrivals to this place?

07:39.025 --> 07:41.159
- That I do.
- And you can provide it?

07:41.161 --> 07:42.160
- Of course.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.496
But where those two men

07:44.631 --> 07:47.098
Were found, it wasn't no plot.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.502
- I see.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.970
Well, it seems to have served
the same purpose.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.373
- You know what I think?

07:56.409 --> 07:58.075
It was a hole
the devil got out of.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.614
(baby cooing)

08:19.466 --> 08:22.133
- I don't think
mr. Frank lloyd wright

08:22.202 --> 08:24.402
Would approve of what we've done
with his home.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.304
- It's our home.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.007
- I don't know if he'd
see it that way.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.877
What's caught your attention?

08:32.880 --> 08:36.147
- It's a list of recent arrivals
to pauper's field.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.350
- And why is that?

08:38.352 --> 08:41.086
- Well, if I'm to believe
the evidence before me,

08:41.088 --> 08:44.489
One of them has risen from
the dead and killed two men.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.025
- I take it you don't
believe that.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.061
- I'm not george crabtree,
julia.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.297
- Have you spoken with him?

08:52.366 --> 08:53.665
- A little.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.967
- And why did he walk out
on his wedding?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.570
- Apparently,
one of his aunts warned him

08:58.572 --> 09:02.173
That if he were to marry, his
bride would be doomed to die.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.444
- I hope you talked
sense to him?

09:06.446 --> 09:10.181
- It's george, julia. Sometimes,
common sense doesn't work.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.184
And what are we doing with that?

09:13.186 --> 09:15.720
- Oh. Doctor grace's gift.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.722
- It's hideous.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.857
- It is that.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.726
- Not to mention impractical.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.762
- Also that.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.798
- Can we burn it?

09:26.867 --> 09:29.133
(laughing)

09:30.537 --> 09:33.004
(indistinct chatter)

09:37.711 --> 09:39.677
(indistinct chatter)

09:49.089 --> 09:52.456
- All right, if anybody has
anything to say, say it now.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.292
(mumbling)
(clearing throat)

09:55.896 --> 09:56.695
Where's watts?

09:56.830 --> 09:57.895
- He left.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.497
- Left for where?

09:59.633 --> 10:01.966
- He didn't say
and no one saw him go.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.968
- What are you doing?

10:04.037 --> 10:06.571
- I'm assisting the detective
with a murder investigation.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.305
The killer came from
beyond the grave.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.041
It's right up your alley.
- I'm sure you'll do fine.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.243
- George!
- Oh, for pete's sake.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.913
What are you doing here?
- I was rather blunt earlier.

10:14.915 --> 10:19.717
I came to apologize.
Not for my prediction,
but for my manner.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.586
- Are you here
on police business?

10:21.721 --> 10:23.588
- I'm here to see my nephew.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.856
- Well, see him
on your own time.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.391
We're working here.
- Sir!

10:26.393 --> 10:27.425
- I'm asking her to leave.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.726
Do you have an issue
with that, crabtree?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.261
- Don't worry, george.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.130
I'm leaving.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.401
- You need to get
your house in order.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.135
- Sir, she's just trying
to protect me.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.938
- I don't understand you,
crabtree.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.806
You've been working
for the last 15 years

10:41.941 --> 10:44.609
With the most logical,
intelligent man I've ever known,

10:44.678 --> 10:47.345
Yet you still believe
all this mumbo jumbo claptrap

10:47.414 --> 10:48.413
That you get fed!

10:48.415 --> 10:50.281
- Sir, my aunt has
never been wrong!

10:50.851 --> 10:51.683
(sighing)

10:55.122 --> 10:56.487
- It's all right, george.

10:56.556 --> 10:57.822
I understand.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.457
- You do?
- Yes!

10:59.493 --> 11:00.725
You're a lucky man.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.360
- Lucky? How so?

11:02.362 --> 11:04.829
- You never actually wanted
to marry miss newsome,

11:04.898 --> 11:07.098
But you were too afraid
to ever say that,

11:07.134 --> 11:10.034
So when your aunt walked in,
you had the perfect excuse.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.502
Almost as if you planned it.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.971
- Higgins, watch what
you're saying!

11:13.106 --> 11:14.239
- George, it's all right.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.640
There's no shame--
- I'm serious. Shut your mouth!

11:16.843 --> 11:17.842
(grunting)

11:17.977 --> 11:19.110
- Pack it in, the pair o' ya.

11:19.245 --> 11:20.244
Crabtree, get out of here.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.613
- Sir! He's trying
to insinuate--

11:21.615 --> 11:23.514
- I don't give a toss what
higgins is trying to say.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.582
Go home!

11:24.651 --> 11:25.784
Not a word!

11:28.655 --> 11:30.421
- Inspector thomas brackenreid?

11:30.424 --> 11:32.023
- Who are you?
What do you want?

11:32.158 --> 11:33.925
- Raymond felding,
private investigator.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.194
A moment of your time?
- I'm busy.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.062
- Uh, it's a matter
that concerns the both of us.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.597
It's about a man
named llewellyn watts.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.166
- Follow me.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.141
This is about watts?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.609
- Yeah, I'm looking for him.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.611
- You and me both.
- I see.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.747
- What's your business with him?

11:55.749 --> 11:57.315
- Ah, it's a personal matter.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.218
- Whether watts is here or not,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.687
He's still in the employ
of the toronto constabulary.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.690
So, I'll ask you again:
What's your business with him?

12:05.692 --> 12:08.626
- I am hoping he can help me
locate a mr. Jack walker.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.361
- How can watts
help you with this?

12:11.565 --> 12:14.365
- I believe they are of a...
Close acquaintance.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.034
- I don't know anything
about that.

12:16.836 --> 12:17.836
- I see.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.637
- And what do you want
with mr. Walker?

12:19.706 --> 12:22.006
- Well, he's abducted a child.

12:22.008 --> 12:25.243
I'm trying to return this child
to his maternal grandparents.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.077
- I don't know anything
about that, either.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.916
- This child is being raised
in an obscene environment

12:31.918 --> 12:33.751
By an immoral man.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.719
It's your duty.

12:35.756 --> 12:40.725
- Mr. Felding, you don't
tell me what my duty is.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.595
- You know, I've been given
a substantial sum

12:44.664 --> 12:46.064
To locate this child.

12:47.467 --> 12:51.269
I'm not shy about offering
a share if someone can help me.

12:51.338 --> 12:54.471
- If you're finished attempting
to bribe a police officer,

12:54.508 --> 12:57.208
I suggest you take your leave,
mr. Felding.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.578
Otherwise, I'll have you
escorted out.

13:03.950 --> 13:04.949
- Good day.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.064
(♪)

13:27.541 --> 13:29.174
Have you, henry?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.108
- I've contacted
the records office.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.244
They're assembling files
on all recent hospital deaths.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.645
- Very good. Thank you.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.017
Julia!

13:40.687 --> 13:41.586
Is everything all right?

13:41.721 --> 13:43.254
- Yes! Everything's
perfectly fine.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.655
Perhaps too much so.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.257
- Ah, look who's here.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.859
Is she reading and writing yet?

13:47.994 --> 13:51.562
- Actually, william has her
working on her maths right now.

13:51.631 --> 13:52.997
- That's a joke, right?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.765
- I wish it were.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.201
- It's important!

13:56.336 --> 13:59.336
- William, I'm thinking
of returning to the clinic.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.006
- Uh, julia.
- Not every day.

14:02.008 --> 14:05.743
But ellie is taking such
excellent care of susannah and--

14:05.879 --> 14:07.412
- Yes, well, for what
we're paying her.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.147
- Did I hear
the clinic mentioned?

14:09.282 --> 14:10.748
Could margaret join you?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.150
I know she valued
her time there.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.684
- Well, yes. Of course.

14:16.055 --> 14:17.622
- If you think it's best.

14:17.757 --> 14:21.158
- And where are you off to?
- Ah. Hospital records office.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.027
I'm looking into
the circumstances

14:23.096 --> 14:24.896
Behind all of their
latest deaths.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.899
- Your husband is looking for
a member of the walking dead.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.301
- Ah! Perhaps he should start
at the mason's lodge.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.869
(laughing)

14:33.139 --> 14:34.505
Do you mind if I join you?

14:34.507 --> 14:36.307
It would be nice
to have a moment alone.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.508
- Of course.

14:37.577 --> 14:41.913
Ah, sir, any news on watts'
whereabouts yet?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.213
- Not as of yet.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.917
- Do you have any idea
if he plans to return?

14:45.919 --> 14:46.984
- I don't know.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.187
He appears to have vanished
into thin air.

14:49.890 --> 14:50.922
Carry on.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.125
(indistinct chatter)

14:54.194 --> 14:55.727
- Oh! Excellent!

14:55.862 --> 14:57.929
These are much better
than the ones in canada.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.897
- Hey, of course they are!
This is new york city.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.500
Everything's better here.
- Mm. Would you like some?

15:03.369 --> 15:05.870
- Hello. How you doing, buddy?

15:05.872 --> 15:07.939
- Ah. All finished for the day?
- Yes, indeed.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.506
I'm all yours. Good lord!

15:09.542 --> 15:11.409
How many of those are you
going to eat in a day?

15:11.544 --> 15:13.144
- I don't count.
I simply consume.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.546
- Oh! I see him
at least three times.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.282
- Oh, we'll have
to put a stop to that.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.484
- No, no, no, no!
Please don't. Please don't.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.152
- So, have you given any thought

15:21.154 --> 15:22.886
As to what you're going to do
now that you're here?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.822
- Have you ever heard
the term "franchise"?

15:24.891 --> 15:26.691
- I have.
- Well, I've been talking

15:26.760 --> 15:29.560
To abraham. Perhaps I'll get
into the bagel business.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.662
- Yes?
- Yes.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.564
Not serious.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.566
Right now I'm simply
happy being here.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.501
All right.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.176
- So there's no living person

15:45.178 --> 15:46.911
Who wished either
of the victims ill?

15:47.046 --> 15:48.646
- None that I can find.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.614
- Are you sure?

15:51.985 --> 15:54.185
You said there was no record of
anyone being interred there.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.655
Perhaps the disturbed
grave was... A hoax?

15:58.791 --> 16:01.325
- So, it's your theory
that a live person

16:01.328 --> 16:05.596
Staged this murder
and then assigned the blame
to a haitian zombie?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.933
Who would believe that?

16:08.935 --> 16:12.470
- I can think of one constable
at your station that might.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.472
- Still, I don't think
it's likely.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.608
- You need to talk
to him, william.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.811
While he still has
a chance with effie.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.880
- If george wants to discuss it
with me, he will.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.615
- Well, you need
to press him on it.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.218
- Julia, I am just
not comfortable

16:27.287 --> 16:29.020
With those sorts
of conversations.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.755
- Well, you need
to get comfortable.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.090
You have a daughter now!

16:33.360 --> 16:35.492
Things that are not pleasant
or easy to talk about

16:35.528 --> 16:37.995
Are going to need to be
discussed at some point.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.031
- I know.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.666
That's why I have you.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.639
- Well, all of the deaths
from st. Michael's

16:48.708 --> 16:49.974
Are accounted for.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.576
(sighing)

16:53.513 --> 16:55.646
I do hope susannah
has the sense

16:55.648 --> 16:57.181
To not follow us
in our footsteps.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.917
- What would you
have her do instead?

17:01.354 --> 17:02.853
- Something exciting.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.122
A politician, perhaps?

17:05.158 --> 17:06.724
An aviator?

17:08.094 --> 17:11.028
I just want her to live her
life not surrounded by death.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.666
And you should talk to george!

17:15.735 --> 17:17.000
(sighing)

17:27.213 --> 17:29.413
- Well, I read
in women's monthly

17:29.449 --> 17:30.747
That when you've suffered
heartbreak,

17:30.784 --> 17:32.283
You should wear
bright colours.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.221
- That's exciting.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.589
- So we should go shopping.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.694
- Effie, I have to talk to you.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.229
- Well, she doesn't want
to talk to you.

17:45.364 --> 17:46.697
- Well, I'm not talking to you.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.199
- I have nothing to say
to you, george.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.633
- Well, I have something
to say to you:

17:50.369 --> 17:51.835
I had to do what I did.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.504
- Well, you did it,
so good for you.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.806
- I did it to save your life.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.441
- George. Grow up.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.510
- My aunt oleander told me that
if I marry you, you would die.

17:59.512 --> 18:03.247
- I heard the same thing
you did and it's poppycock.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.216
It's ridiculous.
- It's not.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.550
- If you didn't want
to marry her,

18:06.619 --> 18:07.718
You could have just said so.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.353
- Millie, this is none
of your business.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.787
- It is! She's my friend.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.723
- I love her!
- You love me?

18:12.792 --> 18:14.458
You love me? Really?

18:14.494 --> 18:15.927
Is that why you humiliated me

18:16.062 --> 18:17.662
In front of my friends
and my family?

18:17.664 --> 18:18.662
- I'm sorry.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.464
- That's not good enough,
george.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.000
Just leave me alone, would you?

18:23.069 --> 18:25.536
Just go back to your spooks
and your spirits.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.471
I am too good to be
with a simpleton.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.007
- Effie.
- Just leave me, would you?

18:30.009 --> 18:33.677
If you had any decency,
you would just leave me alone.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.147
(grunts)

18:40.587 --> 18:41.418
- Effie.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.492
(crying)

18:52.565 --> 18:53.530
- Miss cherry?

18:54.834 --> 18:56.366
- Detective murdoch.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.369
- Is there something
I can help you with?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.103
- How is george faring?

19:01.374 --> 19:03.107
- But that's hardly a matter
for public consumption.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.375
- I wasn't going
to write about it.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.944
I'm simply concerned.
- Oh. My apologies.

19:07.079 --> 19:10.915
- But... There is another matter
I'm concerned about.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.450
- Of course there is.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.652
- What can you tell me about
the zombie killer?

19:15.721 --> 19:16.454
- Nothing.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.458
- There have been reports
that a hideous creature

19:20.460 --> 19:22.927
Has arisen from the grave
and is attacking toronto.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.863
- Can I say,
"that's ridiculous!"

19:25.998 --> 19:27.298
- I've been robbed.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.467
- Excuse me a moment,
miss cherry.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.368
What's happened?
- A man broke into my shop.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.470
I was there.
- Did he hurt you?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.539
- Just scared
the daylights out of me.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.275
He stole two guns,
some ammunition.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.945
- And when did this happen?
- Only an hour ago.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.748
- Well, can you describe him?
- He was a big fellow.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.149
- Anything else?

19:46.186 --> 19:47.885
- He was covered
in dirt and soil.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.954
- I beg your pardon?
- You didn't hear me?

19:50.023 --> 19:52.190
He was covered in earth.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.825
Dirt. And he had a dog.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.828
A crazy-looking thing
with three legs.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.466
- The constable will take the
remainder of your statement.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.971
- The three-legged dog
is a nice twist.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.745
(singing)

20:22.822 --> 20:27.758
♪ good morning
merry sunshine ♪

20:27.893 --> 20:32.896
♪ how did you wake so soon ♪

20:33.933 --> 20:39.337
♪ you've scared
the little birds awake ♪

20:39.339 --> 20:43.707
♪ and shined away the moon ♪

20:44.644 --> 20:46.610
(humming)

20:46.679 --> 20:47.678
(door closing)

20:49.348 --> 20:50.147
- George!

20:52.551 --> 20:53.617
May I join you?

20:56.656 --> 20:59.624
George, what I said
was inappropriate.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.960
- It was incorrect.
- All right.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.461
It was incorrect, as well.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.497
(applause)

21:06.499 --> 21:09.033
- My aunt oleander's never wrong
about these things, henry.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.436
I can't explain. She...
She has some sort of gift.

21:12.472 --> 21:16.106
Even as a child, I remember
once she begged my uncle

21:16.142 --> 21:18.376
Not to go out to sea.
This is back in newfoundland.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.445
And he didn't listen to her
and he never returned.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.715
- He drowned in
the atlantic ocean, george.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.050
It's hardly unusual.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.818
- Yes, but that's one
of many things

21:27.820 --> 21:30.120
That she foretold
and it came true.

21:30.189 --> 21:32.056
I can't expect you
to understand, higgins,

21:32.058 --> 21:33.791
But I can't risk effie's life.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.460
- Constables, I wonder
if you can help?

21:36.496 --> 21:37.728
- Uh, currently off
the clock, ma'am.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.396
Sorry.
- Higgins!

21:39.432 --> 21:40.931
What is it, miss bright?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.866
- Someone broke into
my establishment last night,

21:42.902 --> 21:44.402
Stole three bottles of whisky.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.537
- Did you report it?
- Certainly did.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.206
I told the officer on patrol.
He did nothing.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.876
- Well, unfortunately,
with that kind of thing,

21:52.011 --> 21:53.744
Unless we catch
somebody in the act,

21:53.746 --> 21:54.879
There's little we can do.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.080
- Hardly a surprise.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.882
- Sorry we can't be more help.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.217
- Yes, well...

22:01.487 --> 22:04.221
If all I heard is true,
after the last couple of days,

22:04.223 --> 22:05.956
You deserve to have
a free drink.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.491
On the house.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.759
Not for you, though.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.296
- Good lord!
Does the whole world know?

22:12.365 --> 22:15.499
- George, I just want you
to think about this.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.303
You and effie visited
your aunts, did you not?

22:19.438 --> 22:20.438
- We did.

22:20.573 --> 22:21.839
- And they said nothing
about this

22:21.908 --> 22:23.306
While you were visiting them?

22:23.343 --> 22:25.909
- No. But they didn't know
we were to be married.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.646
My aunt chrysanthemum
found out only days before.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.648
- So, armed with
this information,

22:31.684 --> 22:33.917
They rushed into toronto
to break up the wedding?

22:33.953 --> 22:35.453
That doesn't seem
suspicious to you?

22:35.588 --> 22:37.388
- I think they were trying
to save effie's life.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.723
- Perhaps.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.125
But what if there was
another motive?

22:41.961 --> 22:42.960
It's not as though your aunts

22:43.095 --> 22:45.128
Have followed the straight
and narrow path.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.471
- George wants to speak to me.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.940
- He has questions?
- I suppose.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.409
- Hm. Then we must give him
no reason to doubt

22:58.544 --> 23:00.811
The accuracy
of your predictions.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.513
- Thanks for coming to see me.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.416
- Again, I apologize
for the news I had to deliver.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.221
- Can I ask why you came
all the way here to do so?

23:10.356 --> 23:12.089
- I wanted to tell you
in person.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.224
I did not think a telegram
would suffice.

23:15.328 --> 23:16.627
- How did you even know
I was to be married?

23:16.696 --> 23:18.028
- Chrysanthemum told me.

23:18.164 --> 23:21.298
And, once I heard,
I knew I had to stop it.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.433
- Oh.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.335
So, my upcoming marriage
didn't, uh,

23:24.337 --> 23:25.903
Come to you in a vision?

23:25.905 --> 23:28.906
- No, it did not come
to me in a vision, george!

23:28.908 --> 23:30.707
And you know better
than to mock me!

23:30.777 --> 23:33.977
- Well, maybe I wouldn't if you
hadn't stolen my happiness.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.013
- Something that is
not my intention.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.984
See that man there?

23:41.554 --> 23:43.020
In the grey hat.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.254
- Yes, why?

23:45.257 --> 23:48.892
- Something ill is about
to befall him.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.027
- Good lord!

23:51.063 --> 23:52.729
(screaming)

23:56.402 --> 23:59.003
But... Well, he's not dead.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.871
- I didn't say he was going
to die, george.

24:01.006 --> 24:04.574
I merely said,
"something ill is about
to befall him" and it did.

24:05.478 --> 24:09.212
It is a heavy burden
that I bear

24:09.248 --> 24:12.149
And it pains me
to break your heart,

24:12.151 --> 24:15.986
But, my little cabbage,
I owe you the truth

24:15.988 --> 24:19.957
And a chance for happiness
and not misery.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.967
Nace, george.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.503
Ruthie nearly gets struck
by a vehicle every second week.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.304
- Higgins, I'm telling you:
My aunt said something

24:34.340 --> 24:36.573
Would befall this chap and he
was struck a moment later.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.408
- Like I said, george,
it's a coincidence.

24:38.444 --> 24:39.543
- You're wrong, henry.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.311
I'm living under
a cloud of doom.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.315
- George.
How are you faring?

24:45.852 --> 24:48.485
- I've been better, sir.
- Well, I just happen

24:48.521 --> 24:51.121
To be working on a case
that might interest you.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.256
- Uh, with your permission,

24:52.391 --> 24:53.591
I'm sure you and henry
can handle it.

24:53.726 --> 24:54.558
- George.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.461
You've made one mistake.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.663
There could still be time to--

24:59.665 --> 25:01.665
- If you don't mind, sir,
I have a patrol to get to.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.802
- All right.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.071
(♪)

25:11.744 --> 25:13.677
(indistinct chatter)

25:18.584 --> 25:20.251
- I'm certainly glad
you're here.

25:20.386 --> 25:21.518
- Thank you.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.753
- Saves on having to pay someone
to look in on him.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.155
- Ah! Very funny.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.424
- I shall see you when I return.

25:30.162 --> 25:33.029
- Well, samuel,
what do we do today?

25:35.100 --> 25:37.000
- And nothing else was stolen?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.436
- Just three bottles
of good whisky.

25:39.472 --> 25:41.438
- We should get some
new locks for the door.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.240
- You do work with the police.

25:44.277 --> 25:47.177
Perhaps they could come
around more often.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.446
- That may do more harm
than good.

25:49.515 --> 25:51.782
I think we can tend
to ourselves, miss bright.

25:54.453 --> 25:57.888
The books all appear to be
in order, except for this.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.857
- Yes.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.527
That is our tribute
to alderman prescott.

26:03.529 --> 26:05.028
- We're paying him now?

26:05.731 --> 26:07.131
- Keeps the doors open.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.166
I did tell you, didn't I?

26:11.170 --> 26:12.469
- Did tell me what?

26:13.872 --> 26:15.939
- That given the chance, I'd
make something of this place.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.409
It's a good thing your father
didn't get a hold of it.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.912
- It's a good thing
my father died.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.417
- That is not what I intended
to say, violet.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.785
- That's all right, miss bright.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.355
I share a similar sentiment.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.222
Good night.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.025
(baby cooing)

26:36.662 --> 26:37.561
- Jack!

26:37.696 --> 26:39.296
- Uh, jack's out.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.563
Can I help you?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.700
- Did you see anyone
near my flat?

26:42.702 --> 26:44.835
- No.
- Are you sure?

26:44.970 --> 26:47.037
You didn't hear anything
out of the ordinary?

26:47.073 --> 26:48.805
- I did not. Why?

26:49.442 --> 26:50.607
- Look.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.377
- One moment.

26:57.516 --> 27:00.116
- I've been robbed.
- I can see that.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.387
- What am I supposed to do?

27:03.522 --> 27:06.389
Everything that I own
is in this room.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.724
- Let me take a look.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.926
I have some experience
in these matters.

27:12.798 --> 27:13.763
(sighing)

27:15.000 --> 27:18.034
Let's go see what we can do.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.338
- They took my father's coins.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.474
- Were they hidden?
- Yes.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.642
- So, the thief knew of them?

27:26.478 --> 27:27.544
- I suppose.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.346
- So, it would follow,
you know the thief,

27:29.481 --> 27:32.149
Or the thief knows you.
- I don't know who it is.

27:32.218 --> 27:37.120
- I understand that, but it does
give us a list of suspects.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.022
Who of the people you know

27:39.058 --> 27:41.425
Would know that this coin
collection was valuable?

27:41.427 --> 27:43.260
- I suppose everyone.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.894
I did crow about it a bit.

27:44.930 --> 27:45.995
- Hm. Trevor.

27:46.832 --> 27:47.831
What happened?

27:47.900 --> 27:49.233
Are... You all right?

27:49.368 --> 27:50.767
- Does it look like it?

27:50.803 --> 27:52.369
- Have the police been informed?

27:52.371 --> 27:54.037
- No.
- Well, we should--

27:54.073 --> 27:54.871
- No.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.976
We don't bother the police
and they don't bother us.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.577
That is the way it works here.

28:00.613 --> 28:02.245
- He's right, llewellyn.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.049
- I see.
So, we solve it ourselves?

28:10.656 --> 28:12.055
- What's this then?

28:12.091 --> 28:14.924
- It's a list of the deceased in
toronto over the past two weeks.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.793
- You're missing one.
- I am?

28:17.396 --> 28:19.362
- Maurice majors.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.598
Violet hart's father.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.568
Watts thinks I killed him.

28:26.539 --> 28:27.871
That's part of the reason
why he left.

28:29.675 --> 28:30.740
- Did you?

28:30.776 --> 28:32.575
- Don't be a prat, higgins.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.746
- You should come back
to wexford.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.081
Roderick still does
carry a torch.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.017
- And I hope he lights himself
on fire with it.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.753
(laughing)
my life is here, millie.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.022
- There!

28:47.059 --> 28:49.092
It's that witch that
destroyed your life!

28:49.161 --> 28:50.694
- Millie.
- You!

28:50.829 --> 28:51.995
- No!

28:52.131 --> 28:53.696
- You should be ashamed
of yourself!

28:53.733 --> 28:54.965
Showing your face in public!

28:55.034 --> 28:56.099
- You're the maid!

28:56.168 --> 28:58.736
- The maid of honour
at a wedding you destroyed.

28:58.871 --> 28:59.936
- Oh.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.372
I know your heart
is filled with grief.

29:02.374 --> 29:03.674
- It's more like anger.

29:03.676 --> 29:05.441
- I was only trying
to save the two of you.

29:05.478 --> 29:06.910
- Well, I think you are crazy.

29:07.045 --> 29:08.779
And wrong. And george?

29:08.848 --> 29:11.048
You've filled his head with--
- with the truth!

29:11.183 --> 29:12.916
- Oh! This is ridiculous!
- Millie!

29:12.985 --> 29:14.651
This is george crabtree's fault.

29:14.653 --> 29:18.721
- It is no one's fault! No one
except the stars and destiny.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.724
- Toronto constabulary!
Move, please!

29:20.726 --> 29:22.426
- Let me pass.
- Why don't you curse me?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.727
- Millie, that's enough!
- What's going on here?

29:24.764 --> 29:26.530
- Oh, it's all right, george.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.799
We were... We were just having
a conversation.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.534
- We were just on our way
as well.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.204
- Mm.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.142
(sighing)

29:39.178 --> 29:40.477
(door closing)
(gasps)

29:40.479 --> 29:41.678
- Detective!

29:41.747 --> 29:43.647
I was just about to leave.

29:43.716 --> 29:44.948
How can I help you?

29:45.017 --> 29:47.351
- I understand your father
passed away recently.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.620
My condolences.
- Thank you.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.956
- If I may, what killed him?

29:53.091 --> 29:54.891
- He had a brain embolism.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.392
Very unexpected.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.029
- Where was he buried?

29:59.932 --> 30:01.464
- Why do you want to know that?

30:02.635 --> 30:05.168
- Just paying proper attention
to a case I'm on.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.971
- His body was shipped
to new york.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.406
I knew him well enough to know

30:09.408 --> 30:11.441
That's where he wanted
his resting place to be.

30:11.443 --> 30:12.276
- Mm.

30:13.679 --> 30:15.311
- Could you provide me
with the location

30:15.347 --> 30:16.946
Of his final destination?

30:17.516 --> 30:18.481
- Of course.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.257
- Very good.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.258
Thank you.

30:28.393 --> 30:29.593
- If that is all?

30:29.662 --> 30:30.627
- It is.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.161
For now.

30:34.066 --> 30:37.167
- Well, I'm going to head
to the star bright club.

30:37.302 --> 30:39.135
There's been a robbery
there last night

30:39.205 --> 30:41.037
And the police have done
very little about it.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.608
The burden of running
a black business, I imagine.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.017
(door opening)

31:00.960 --> 31:02.292
- New york city?

31:02.328 --> 31:03.560
- That's what she said.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.162
I've spoken with the railway

31:05.297 --> 31:07.964
And they confirm they delivered
a coffin to that address.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.433
- Well, I feel a trip
is in order,

31:10.469 --> 31:12.836
If only to eliminate him
as a suspect.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.505
- Well, sir, a telephone call
would do the same.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.307
- I believe watts is there.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.642
I need to talk to him.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.110
I threatened to reveal
his secret.

31:22.147 --> 31:23.380
- Sir?

31:23.382 --> 31:24.248
- It was rash.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.583
I was angry and I need
to make it right.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.385
And there's more:

31:28.454 --> 31:30.888
A private detective
is looking for jack walker.

31:31.023 --> 31:33.122
He wants to take
his child away from him.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.358
I feel I need to warn them.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.170
- Thank you, julia.

31:47.172 --> 31:50.340
- Oh, for what?
- Uh! A most fulfilling day.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.275
- You're most welcome.

31:53.279 --> 31:54.745
Margaret?
- Hm?

31:54.747 --> 31:56.813
- Now that your children
have grown...

31:56.882 --> 31:59.282
- Ah, well, one in jail,

31:59.285 --> 32:01.685
The other one
an itinerant actor.

32:01.754 --> 32:05.088
Are you sure you'd like me
to look after your child?

32:05.090 --> 32:07.657
- Oh. That's not
what I was suggesting.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.593
- Oh. I see.

32:10.963 --> 32:13.096
- I was thinking of starting
a nurse-in-training program

32:13.132 --> 32:14.831
And you'd be an excellent
candidate.

32:14.833 --> 32:15.933
- Me?

32:16.535 --> 32:17.900
- Why not you?

32:19.038 --> 32:21.038
- Margaret nightingale.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.506
- If you wish.

32:22.641 --> 32:23.806
(grunts)
margaret!

32:25.344 --> 32:26.776
Are you all right?

32:27.646 --> 32:29.045
- I just need to lay down.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.748
- Margaret, get a bed ready.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.317
Who did this to you?

32:35.287 --> 32:37.253
- Please, I just need
to lie down.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.655
(crying)

32:40.726 --> 32:41.725
(moaning)

32:49.001 --> 32:50.666
(eerie music)

33:03.015 --> 33:04.147
- Anybody there?

33:26.872 --> 33:29.705
"a cat is not the only thing
with nine lives."

33:37.716 --> 33:38.582
(sighing)

33:39.451 --> 33:41.184
- Oh! There's your mother now.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.151
- Oh.

33:43.222 --> 33:45.121
- How was your first day
back at the clinic?

33:45.157 --> 33:48.591
- Oh, trying.
But it's good to be back.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.794
(sighing)
- you seem troubled.

33:53.198 --> 33:56.266
- A woman came into the clinic
just as we were closing.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.700
Badly bruised.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.937
She said she'd fallen down
a flight of stairs.

34:01.073 --> 34:02.205
- Ah.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.940
And I take it that
wasn't the case.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.877
- I've seen enough bruising
in my life

34:07.913 --> 34:09.346
To know that she was lying.

34:09.348 --> 34:10.947
She was assaulted.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.484
- Would you like me
to speak with her?

34:15.287 --> 34:16.219
- Oh.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.290
I'll speak with her, see if
I can get her to come through.

34:22.627 --> 34:25.428
Aw, anyway, don't you have
a zombie to catch?

34:25.431 --> 34:26.630
- Oh, yes.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.665
- Oh, my love.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.637
I promise that mama and papa

34:33.639 --> 34:36.639
Are going to take care of you
no matter what.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.342
Protect you always.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.647
- George!
- Good grief!

34:43.649 --> 34:44.981
Why are you two here?

34:44.983 --> 34:47.150
- To make you feel better.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.285
- That's a laugh.
If you don't mind.

34:49.354 --> 34:51.454
- No. Let us speak.
- Why should I?

34:51.490 --> 34:53.756
Nothing good seems to come
of it when you open your mouth.

34:53.826 --> 34:56.092
- George crabtree, your manners!

34:56.128 --> 35:01.464
- We wish...
To throw you a party!

35:01.467 --> 35:03.266
- A party? Are you mad?

35:03.335 --> 35:05.735
- Well, it is your birthday
in three days.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.837
We should celebrate.
- With family.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.539
- It's the least we can do.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.209
- Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not interested.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.477
Now, if you don't mind,
I have to work tomorrow.

35:16.381 --> 35:17.647
- Party?

35:17.782 --> 35:18.849
- If you don't mind.

35:22.821 --> 35:23.954
(sighing)

35:24.089 --> 35:25.021
- Excuse me.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.224
Hello, miss newsome.

35:29.094 --> 35:30.560
- Thank you for coming, henry.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.828
- I... Don't know
how I can help you.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.031
- Henry, I'm desperate.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.366
- Well, I can see that.

35:36.501 --> 35:37.567
You called me.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.638
- How well do you know
george's family?

35:42.674 --> 35:44.374
- Only what he has told me
about them.

35:44.443 --> 35:45.908
Didn't you meet them all?

35:45.944 --> 35:49.379
- Yes, but it was only
a quick visit last year

35:49.381 --> 35:51.113
And they all seemed
pleasant enough.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.615
- Even the scary witch?

35:53.886 --> 35:55.585
- Well, she didn't present
herself as such at the time.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.821
So, you know nothing about them?

36:00.058 --> 36:04.327
- I know a few of them are...
Ladies of easy virtue.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.262
And george thinks
very highly of them.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.798
- Yes. Well, that's plain
as day, isn't it?

36:08.867 --> 36:10.866
He left me at the altar
because of them.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.870
Henry, can you talk
to the newfoundland police

36:13.872 --> 36:16.072
And find out everything
you can about them?

36:18.210 --> 36:19.542
- You don't trust them?

36:19.611 --> 36:23.479
- George and I met most of them
when we went last year.

36:23.481 --> 36:25.081
There was no hint of this curse,

36:25.117 --> 36:27.284
Even though it was clear
that george and I were together.

36:27.419 --> 36:28.952
- I'll do what I can.

36:31.156 --> 36:33.289
So, we're a team, then?

36:33.325 --> 36:35.425
- For better or worse.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.459
- Hm.

36:40.632 --> 36:41.698
Good day.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.366
- Thank you, henry.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.835
(door opening and closing)

36:47.772 --> 36:49.439
(♪)

36:52.277 --> 36:53.510
- You didn't open it?

36:53.645 --> 36:55.111
- I sure did not.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.781
- You want to stand back.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.515
This is not
for the faint-hearted.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.461
- What's that supposed to mean?

37:12.564 --> 37:15.598
- It means... Someone's
pulled a fast one.

37:45.230 --> 37:46.429
- Detective murdoch.

37:46.465 --> 37:47.764
- Miss cherry.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.232
- Anything to report on
the murderous zombie?

37:50.269 --> 37:53.103
- Other than the fact that I am
not pursuing a murderous zombie?

37:53.238 --> 37:54.304
No.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.372
- So, he can run free
on the streets?

37:57.642 --> 37:58.708
- Miss cherry.

37:59.377 --> 38:00.376
- Constable higgins.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.245
- You are... Well?

38:04.349 --> 38:05.581
- What do you want?

38:06.852 --> 38:09.586
- Do you have any friends
at the tribune in st. John's?

38:09.588 --> 38:10.619
- I may.

38:11.856 --> 38:13.989
- May I impose upon you
a favour then?

38:15.260 --> 38:18.127
- As long as you remember
my golden rule: Tit for tat.

38:24.703 --> 38:27.203
- We should cancel
our subscription to this rag.

38:27.272 --> 38:28.504
- Is that so?

38:29.274 --> 38:30.673
- Look at this drivel.

38:30.709 --> 38:33.409
Miss louise cherry
has clearly lost her mind.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.644
Who would believe such rubbish?

38:36.415 --> 38:38.248
- Miss cherry is not stupid.

38:38.383 --> 38:40.249
- You think it could be true?

38:40.285 --> 38:41.617
- I don't know.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.152
I don't know what to think.

38:44.623 --> 38:45.721
Look at this.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.294
- What on earth is this?
- I don't know.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.763
- Who left it?
- No idea.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.032
- You can't think...
- Don't be foolish.

38:57.069 --> 38:58.367
He's dead.

39:03.708 --> 39:05.141
- So you are going
to pursue this?

39:05.210 --> 39:07.043
- I'm just going
to ask a few questions.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.911
- Even though trevor told you
to let the matter lie?

39:08.947 --> 39:11.581
- I won't involve him
or the police.

39:11.583 --> 39:12.716
(knocking on door)

39:13.785 --> 39:15.785
- Must be timothy and the gang.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.520
Please don't bring up
the robbery.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.394
- I need to talk to you two.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.332
- Well, it's simple.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.033
We'll just leave.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.602
- And he's following you?

39:33.638 --> 39:34.937
- He's in new york.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.740
He didn't follow me here.
I lost him.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.340
- But it's just
a matter of time.

39:38.377 --> 39:39.342
- Probably.

39:40.445 --> 39:41.677
- What do you suggest?

39:43.014 --> 39:45.381
- Well, he seems like the kind
of man who could be bought.

39:45.384 --> 39:46.850
- So, no legal recourse?

39:46.852 --> 39:48.551
- For your kind, likely no.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.154
- That's why I told you to stay
out of this trevor business.

39:53.691 --> 39:56.059
But I do appreciate you taking
the time to warn us about this.

39:56.061 --> 39:56.893
- Of course.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.695
I couldn't use
your telephone, could I?

40:08.373 --> 40:11.374
Yes, uh, station house four.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.176
Toronto, ontario
and I'd like to speak

40:13.311 --> 40:15.144
To detective
william murdoch, please.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.847
- Let the fun begin.

40:17.982 --> 40:20.282
I do hope samuel is tucked in
for the evening?

40:21.853 --> 40:23.586
- Sir, are you quite sure?

40:23.721 --> 40:25.121
The coffin was empty?

40:25.190 --> 40:27.590
- It was and the recipient
had no knowledge

40:27.592 --> 40:29.125
Of why it was delivered to him.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.594
- Did he have any knowledge
of a maurice majors?

40:31.729 --> 40:33.763
- No.
- So, mrs. Hart is definitely

40:33.898 --> 40:36.132
Up to something.
- It's possible.

40:37.269 --> 40:40.336
- Well, any luck finding
jack walker?

40:40.372 --> 40:42.872
- I've found them both.
Watts and walker.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.074
Listen, murdoch,
I'll be back in a day,

40:45.076 --> 40:46.876
So right now I'm about to have
a drink with some lads,

40:47.011 --> 40:48.611
So I'll talk to you later.
Bye-bye.

40:51.015 --> 40:52.915
(music playing)
- good evening?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.950
- Hello.
- You have a name?

40:54.986 --> 40:57.220
- Thomas.
- Ah, well, tom.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.421
I'm tim.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.889
Let me grab you a drink.

41:22.780 --> 41:24.046
(camera shutter clicking)

41:26.651 --> 41:27.784
(camera shutter clicking)

41:31.789 --> 41:33.055
(camera shutter clicking)

41:34.726 --> 41:36.058
(camera shutter clicking)

41:37.595 --> 41:39.262
(eerie music)

41:54.613 --> 41:55.678
- You have a table?

41:57.415 --> 41:59.549
And don't tell me there
are no dogs allowed.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.083
I'm not an irishman, either.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.619
(laughing)
- you're dead.

42:03.655 --> 42:05.088
- Is that so?

42:05.090 --> 42:06.356
News to me.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.491
Hey, this animal and I
need sustenance.

42:09.528 --> 42:10.859
We're mighty hungry.

42:11.763 --> 42:15.031
You move when I say you move.

42:15.100 --> 42:17.066
Or I snap your neck
and this girl knows

42:17.068 --> 42:18.768
Where her next meal's
coming from.

42:18.903 --> 42:20.736
- What do you want?
- What do you think?

42:23.542 --> 42:24.774
I want your money.

42:25.477 --> 42:26.576
What is it they say?

42:27.478 --> 42:28.945
Your money or your life?

42:29.881 --> 42:31.247
- I can't get you money.

42:32.116 --> 42:33.716
Not without violet's permission.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.250
(laughing)

42:36.054 --> 42:37.186
That's funny?

42:38.023 --> 42:39.789
- Damn, I taught
that woman well!

42:42.827 --> 42:43.892
Well, then...

42:47.265 --> 42:48.864
You best get her permission.

42:50.201 --> 42:52.134
Or I'm going to choose
the second option.

42:53.671 --> 42:54.536
Son.

42:58.276 --> 43:00.676
(dramatic music)

43:03.715 --> 43:06.082
Come on, girl, take a seat.

43:06.151 --> 43:08.751
This fella's gonna
make us a decent meal.

43:16.227 --> 43:18.628
- You were to come down for tea.

43:19.497 --> 43:20.963
- I don't like doing this.

43:20.966 --> 43:22.098
George is a good man.

43:22.233 --> 43:23.833
I don't like to see him suffer.

43:23.902 --> 43:25.968
- It won't be much longer.

43:26.905 --> 43:28.304
His birthday
is fast approaching,

43:28.306 --> 43:30.572
And then it'll be over
and he can marry her

43:30.609 --> 43:32.808
And be as poor and happy
as he wants.

43:37.148 --> 43:38.915
(♪)

43:41.686 --> 43:43.686
Subtitling: Difuze
