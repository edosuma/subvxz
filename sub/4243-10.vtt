<i>Dear Journal,</i>

00:02.275 --> 00:04.043
<i>it's Christmas again...</i>

00:04.077 --> 00:06.045
<i>that time of year</i>
<i>when parents aren't arrested</i>

00:06.079 --> 00:07.513
<i>for forcing their children to sit</i>

00:07.547 --> 00:10.249
<i>on an old man's weirdly hot lap.</i>

00:10.283 --> 00:14.653
<i>That magical season when five</i>
<i>seemingly separate storylines</i>

00:14.688 --> 00:18.323
<i>are cleverly sandwiched</i>
<i>between commercial breaks,</i>

00:18.358 --> 00:22.394
<i>and then tied together at</i>
<i>the end like a beautiful bow.</i>

00:22.429 --> 00:25.097
<i>Like that movie</i> Love, Actually.

00:25.131 --> 00:27.666
<i>Which I don't think anyone</i>
<i>really cares for,</i>

00:27.701 --> 00:30.803
<i>and yet it is constantly on cable.</i>

00:47.921 --> 00:50.723
Whoa... hey, dude,
are you all right?

00:52.092 --> 00:54.293
Whoa, wh-wh-what
happened to your face?

00:54.327 --> 00:56.395
I fell, okay?

00:56.429 --> 00:58.349
The stupid janitor didn't
put salt on the ramp,

00:58.350 --> 01:00.590
like he's supposed to, and
my wheels don't have chains,

01:00.591 --> 01:04.470
so I slipped backwards and
tipped over on the ice.

01:04.504 --> 01:05.738
It's fine. It's nothing.

01:05.772 --> 01:07.206
No, no, no, no...
hey, hey, hey.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.640
That's not nothing.

01:08.675 --> 01:10.609
That's some pretty serious road rash.

01:10.643 --> 01:12.643
Let me take you to
the nurse's office, all right?

01:18.451 --> 01:20.586
You hit your head pretty hard.

01:20.620 --> 01:22.154
I'm going to go call your mother.

01:22.188 --> 01:24.089
Lay down till she gets here.

01:24.124 --> 01:26.892
Want me to help you get
up on the cot? No.

01:26.926 --> 01:28.927
I don't want anybody
to help me with anything.

01:28.962 --> 01:30.596
I'm tired of being so helpless,

01:30.630 --> 01:32.297
I'm tired of everybody pitying me,

01:32.332 --> 01:34.166
and I'm tired of being
in this damn chair.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.602
Anyone could have fallen
on the ice, all right?

01:36.636 --> 01:38.196
Yeah, but they could've gotten back up,

01:38.197 --> 01:39.917
instead of laying there
screaming for help

01:39.918 --> 01:41.406
until some freshman girl showed up.

01:41.441 --> 01:43.675
Dude, don't bite my head off.

01:43.710 --> 01:45.410
But you need some rest,

01:45.445 --> 01:47.346
so I'm going to help
you out, all right?

01:59.192 --> 02:02.294
I just wish I was never
in that dumb chair.

02:02.328 --> 02:04.830
I know, buddy. I know.

02:44.871 --> 02:46.338
Tina!

02:46.372 --> 02:48.140
Look.

02:48.174 --> 02:50.142
Can you believe it?

02:50.176 --> 02:52.878
Believe what?

02:52.912 --> 02:55.514
Why are you stuttering again?

02:55.548 --> 02:58.483
She never stopped because
you never became friends.

02:58.518 --> 03:00.385
Rory?!

03:00.420 --> 03:01.887
What are you doing here?

03:01.921 --> 03:03.922
And talk slowly,
so I can understand you.

03:03.957 --> 03:06.692
I'm your Christmas guardian angel.

03:06.726 --> 03:07.993
And I've granted your wish.

03:08.027 --> 03:10.162
Your car accident never happened.

03:10.196 --> 03:12.664
You were never in that dumb chair.

03:12.699 --> 03:14.566
That's insane.

03:14.601 --> 03:15.834
Don't believe me?

03:15.869 --> 03:17.502
Ask Becky.

03:17.537 --> 03:19.371
Merry Christmas, stud.

03:19.405 --> 03:22.941
Want to fool around?
I can't get pregnant.

03:22.976 --> 03:24.743
What? No.

03:26.412 --> 03:28.347
Becky's the school slut now.

03:28.381 --> 03:30.015
No one treats her with any respect.

03:30.049 --> 03:31.683
But I do.
I took her on a date.

03:31.718 --> 03:33.252
No, you didn't.

03:33.286 --> 03:35.166
You were too busy throwing
losers in Dumpsters

03:35.167 --> 03:37.327
to give her any attention
or treat her with kindness,

03:37.328 --> 03:40.058
and as a result, she never
learned any self-respect.

03:40.093 --> 03:42.261
Hey! Hey, Kurt!
Nice cape!

03:42.295 --> 03:43.975
Who are you supposed
to be... Super Homo?

03:43.976 --> 03:45.364
What are you guys doing?

03:45.398 --> 03:48.433
Just having some fun
with Little Lord Gay Boy.

03:48.468 --> 03:50.569
But you guys
aren't straight douche bags.

03:50.603 --> 03:52.170
You sang Lady Gaga songs.

03:54.140 --> 03:55.741
Keep telling those dirty lies,

03:55.775 --> 03:57.910
and we'll break your friggin' legs.

04:07.587 --> 04:09.421
Kurt, didn't you graduate?

04:09.455 --> 04:12.438
I should've, but I couldn't
bear coming to school

04:12.439 --> 04:14.559
more than twice a week,
because of all the bullying.

04:14.594 --> 04:17.428
All the homeschooling
set me back a year.

04:17.463 --> 04:18.930
What does Blaine say about that?

04:18.964 --> 04:21.166
Who's Blaine?

04:23.202 --> 04:25.170
Mr. Shue,
thank God you're here.

04:25.204 --> 04:27.472
We need to call an emergency
meeting of the glee club.

04:27.507 --> 04:28.588
What glee club?

04:28.589 --> 04:30.429
I couldn't get enough
of you brats interested

04:30.430 --> 04:31.910
to get that lame idea off the ground.

04:31.945 --> 04:33.945
Will, I need your paycheck
before you blow it all

04:33.946 --> 04:35.363
on booze and flannel shirts.

04:35.364 --> 04:37.364
Sheets and Things is having
a big Christmas sale,

04:37.365 --> 04:38.925
and we desperately need an air purifier

04:38.926 --> 04:40.686
for our moldy garbage heap
of an apartment.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.454
That's a doll.
Shh!

04:42.488 --> 04:44.328
He's so drunk he doesn't
know the difference.

04:45.558 --> 04:47.659
You're cute.

04:47.694 --> 04:49.861
Where's Miss Pillsbury?

04:49.896 --> 04:51.163
In Hawaii.

04:51.197 --> 04:53.432
With her dear, sweet
husband Coach Tanaka.

04:53.466 --> 04:55.367
It's a match made
in heaven, right, honey?

04:55.401 --> 04:56.868
That's right.

05:10.683 --> 05:13.051
Rachel?
What are you doing here?

05:13.086 --> 05:15.206
You live in New York.
You go to the most prestigious

05:15.207 --> 05:16.455
drama school in the country.

05:16.489 --> 05:18.957
Well, I am gonna be in
the Lima Community Players'

05:18.992 --> 05:20.692
production of <i>The Music Man.</i>

05:20.727 --> 05:22.887
Tell me you're at least playing
Marian the Librarian.

05:22.888 --> 05:24.896
No, that's the lead.
I'm just in the chorus.

05:24.931 --> 05:26.531
Excuse me.

05:26.566 --> 05:27.566
Rachel...

05:27.600 --> 05:29.234
what's going on?
Let go of me!

05:29.268 --> 05:31.169
What happened you?
What happened to all of us?

05:32.071 --> 05:32.904
- Hey!
- No!

05:37.176 --> 05:39.378
Rory! Rory, where are you?

05:39.412 --> 05:41.079
What's wrong?

05:41.114 --> 05:42.147
What's wrong?!

05:42.181 --> 05:43.548
Everything.

05:43.583 --> 05:44.983
How can everything be so messed up?

05:44.984 --> 05:46.418
You weren't in a wheelchair,

05:46.452 --> 05:49.221
so you were too busy
playing football to join Glee.

05:50.089 --> 05:51.723
It turns out...

05:51.758 --> 05:54.326
you were the glue of Glee, Artie.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.329
The quiet, steady,
beating heart of the group.

05:57.363 --> 06:00.365
No glue... no Glee.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.400
I can fix this.

06:01.434 --> 06:02.868
I can.

06:02.902 --> 06:04.182
I'll get them all back together.

06:04.183 --> 06:06.038
Just you watch, I'll fix it.

06:06.072 --> 06:07.232
You're probably wondering why

06:07.233 --> 06:09.193
I've asked you all
to meet me in the choir room.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.942
This is Coach Sue's craft room.

06:10.977 --> 06:13.345
Well, in an alternate universe,
it was the choir room.

06:13.379 --> 06:15.514
I had a dream about that once.
I know.

06:15.548 --> 06:17.582
And it was a place that
always made me feel safe.

06:17.617 --> 06:19.785
And I know it did
for a lot of you, too.

06:19.819 --> 06:22.254
That's 'cause we danced
together, we sang together,

06:22.288 --> 06:23.455
we took turns up here.

06:23.489 --> 06:24.536
Like Finn said,

06:24.537 --> 06:25.857
it's about the love of the music.

06:25.892 --> 06:26.858
Dude, are you high?

06:26.893 --> 06:28.360
I never said that.

06:28.394 --> 06:30.796
Why don't you just
show us what you mean?

Is that mine?

08:20.106 --> 08:21.306
No.

08:21.340 --> 08:22.974
It's Quinn's.

08:23.009 --> 08:24.489
Without the encouragement and support

08:24.490 --> 08:25.844
from you and her friends in Glee,

08:25.852 --> 08:27.212
Quinn was never able to walk again

08:27.246 --> 08:28.980
after her accident.

08:29.015 --> 08:30.882
Wait a minute,
if there was no Glee Club,

08:30.917 --> 08:33.385
there was no Finchel wedding
for her to drive to, so...

08:33.419 --> 08:35.687
Quinn texts and drives
in every timeline, Artie.

08:37.456 --> 08:39.724
Okay.
Why isn't she in it?

08:39.759 --> 08:41.426
She died.

08:43.863 --> 08:45.096
How?

08:45.131 --> 08:47.032
Of a broken heart.

08:48.901 --> 08:52.137
Much like her body,
her spirit never recovered.

09:16.395 --> 09:18.096
<i>Come on, dude, you mom's here.</i>

09:28.808 --> 09:30.642
You know, I could use some help here.

09:33.746 --> 09:36.114
Come on, grab onto me.

09:38.451 --> 09:40.752
Sorry, Artie.

09:40.786 --> 09:44.623
I know it really sucks being
in this chair sometimes.

09:44.657 --> 09:47.325
For better or for worse,
this chair is a part of me.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.361
It's made me who I am.

09:56.678 --> 09:58.646
Well, if you're not
going to come to Lima,

09:58.680 --> 10:00.681
then my dads and I
insist you come with us

10:00.715 --> 10:02.883
to the Rosie O'Donnell
Gay Holiday Cruise.

10:02.918 --> 10:04.085
It's going to be so much fun.

10:04.119 --> 10:05.093
There's even going to be

10:05.094 --> 10:06.854
a Jessie Tyler Ferguson
look-alike contest.

10:06.888 --> 10:08.222
Well, in that case,

10:08.256 --> 10:09.757
I'm definitely gonna have to pass.

10:09.791 --> 10:10.972
Honey, uh...
And besides,

10:10.973 --> 10:12.893
there's really no reason
to go to Lima, anyway.

10:12.928 --> 10:14.436
My dad and Finn and Carole

10:14.437 --> 10:16.197
are visiting Carole's
sister in Zanesville,

10:16.198 --> 10:18.238
and she always has too much
eggnog and blacks out.

10:18.239 --> 10:18.839
Happy holidays!

10:18.840 --> 10:20.167
Well, what about Blaine?

10:20.202 --> 10:22.203
I talk to him.

10:22.237 --> 10:23.671
But, you know, he knows

10:23.705 --> 10:25.406
that I'm saving my money for NYADA now.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.560
And it'll be good to just
have some time for myself,

10:27.561 --> 10:29.510
you know, and think about things and...

10:30.912 --> 10:32.279
Can you get that?

10:32.314 --> 10:34.281
Okay, what do we need for this tree?

10:34.316 --> 10:36.283
It's just hopeless...

10:39.121 --> 10:40.354
Dad!

10:41.556 --> 10:42.590
Burt?

10:42.624 --> 10:44.225
Season's greetings!

10:44.259 --> 10:45.459
Oh, my God!

10:45.494 --> 10:46.934
Well, I got a tree...
you need one?

10:46.935 --> 10:48.028
Come in!

10:48.063 --> 10:49.763
Okay, all right.
I got it, I got it.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.802
Okay, you can let go now.

10:54.836 --> 10:56.103
Okay.

10:56.138 --> 10:57.605
Come on, let's go look at it.

10:59.574 --> 11:01.775
Oh, it's perfect.

11:01.810 --> 11:03.370
Yeah, well, I couldn't imagine you guys

11:03.371 --> 11:05.091
celebrating Christmas
without a real tree.

11:05.092 --> 11:07.548
You know, his mom used
to always buy the tree.

11:07.582 --> 11:08.942
I'd always tell her to wait till I

11:08.943 --> 11:10.583
got home from work,
but she never could.

11:10.585 --> 11:12.887
And then, the first Christmas
after his mom died,

11:12.921 --> 11:15.322
I totally forgot about it.

11:15.357 --> 11:17.091
That is, until

11:17.125 --> 11:18.492
I saw little Kurt

11:18.527 --> 11:19.994
hanging his own special version

11:20.028 --> 11:21.295
of a Christmas ornament

11:21.329 --> 11:23.330
on his window shade Christmas Eve.

11:25.033 --> 11:27.268
My mom's perfume bottle.

11:27.302 --> 11:28.936
Oh, I always loved the way she smelled.

11:28.970 --> 11:30.638
So I pull him out of bed,

11:30.672 --> 11:31.859
I throw a coat on him,

11:31.860 --> 11:33.340
I drive straight through a snowstorm,

11:33.375 --> 11:35.109
right down to the Christmas tree sale.

11:35.143 --> 11:39.513
It was the first time he
smiled since his mom died.

11:41.449 --> 11:44.418
Okay, no tears on Christmas Eve.

11:44.452 --> 11:46.787
This box is full
of happy memories, as well.

11:46.821 --> 11:48.522
Like our Christmas trip to Dollywood.

11:48.557 --> 11:50.024
Oh, yeah.
That one I like.

11:50.058 --> 11:51.158
That trip was for me.

11:51.193 --> 11:52.927
Oh, and this redneck NASCAR trip,

11:52.961 --> 11:55.429
that was for you. Hey,
this is a nice ornament.

11:55.463 --> 11:57.164
Let's hang them.

11:57.199 --> 11:59.466
All right, well, I wish I could stay,

11:59.501 --> 12:01.835
but can't really be late
for a cruise, so...

12:01.870 --> 12:03.830
Oh, hold on. You got to
open this before you go.

12:03.831 --> 12:06.240
Uh, happy Hanukkah, merry Christmas.

12:09.344 --> 12:12.379
It's for your first
New York holiday season.

12:12.414 --> 12:13.981
Hang it together.
Thank you.

12:14.015 --> 12:15.816
And then you can go.
Okay.

12:17.252 --> 12:20.154
Kurt, okay, this, to our very first.

12:20.188 --> 12:22.156
New York Christmas.

12:24.059 --> 12:26.060
Ha. I never thought
I'd see this day.

12:26.094 --> 12:27.995
Us walking down the
streets of New York,

12:28.029 --> 12:30.130
right after seeing a
live Broadway musical.

12:30.165 --> 12:32.399
Well, the Rockettes
might have better legs than me,

12:32.434 --> 12:34.668
but they can't touch
my "Single Ladies" performance.

12:34.703 --> 12:36.637
That was the best
musical I've ever seen.

12:36.671 --> 12:37.905
Ah, it's freezing!

12:37.939 --> 12:39.907
I think it's time to check off another.

12:39.941 --> 12:43.544
Hummel family tradition:
Hot chocolate.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.017
Kurt, I have something to tell you,

12:50.051 --> 12:51.999
and I came here
because it's the kind of thing

12:52.000 --> 12:53.320
I want to tell you
face-to-face.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.515
Don't like the sound of that.

12:54.522 --> 12:56.023
Look, I'm just going to

12:56.057 --> 12:58.025
come out and say it
because there's no...

12:58.059 --> 12:59.727
good way to say it.

12:59.761 --> 13:02.896
Uh, I have prostate cancer.

13:07.235 --> 13:09.436
Feel like I'm going to be sick.

13:09.471 --> 13:10.704
No, no, hey, hey, look at me.

13:10.739 --> 13:12.072
Do I look like a guy who's dying?

13:12.107 --> 13:13.540
We caught it early.

13:13.575 --> 13:16.010
You know, local stage, no spreading.

13:16.044 --> 13:18.212
Cure rate's nearly 100%.

13:18.246 --> 13:20.247
For healthy people, Dad.

13:20.282 --> 13:21.642
You've already had a heart attack.

13:21.643 --> 13:23.083
The heart attack is what, you know,

13:23.118 --> 13:26.120
made me get checkups twice a year.

13:26.154 --> 13:29.256
It's just really scary to think

13:29.291 --> 13:33.560
that when I finally reach my destiny,

13:33.595 --> 13:35.896
that you won't be around to see it.

13:35.930 --> 13:36.964
Hey.

13:37.999 --> 13:39.933
I will be there.

13:39.968 --> 13:42.069
I promise.

13:46.274 --> 13:48.909
Look, can I just give you
one piece of advice

13:48.943 --> 13:52.046
while we're still talking
father to son?

13:52.080 --> 13:55.949
This is three times I've had
to stare death in the eye.

13:55.984 --> 13:58.552
And you know the one thing
I took away from all that?

13:58.586 --> 14:00.421
You have got to hold
the people you love

14:00.455 --> 14:01.955
close to you no matter what.

14:10.598 --> 14:12.800
Dad, you okay?

14:12.834 --> 14:15.569
Do you need a pillow or tea, water?

14:15.603 --> 14:16.837
No, Kurt, stop.

14:16.871 --> 14:19.340
Come on, let's focus on happy things.

14:19.374 --> 14:21.842
Like our Christmas traditions.

14:21.876 --> 14:25.446
I am looking forward to watching
basketball on Christmas Day

14:25.480 --> 14:27.948
while you pretend you watch with me.

14:27.982 --> 14:29.917
You mean while I secretly read <i>Vogue?</i>

14:29.951 --> 14:31.352
That was never a secret.

14:31.386 --> 14:33.520
No, like our other
Christmas traditions.

14:33.555 --> 14:36.256
Like on Christmas Eve,
where we each exchange one gift.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.025
My favorite part.

14:38.059 --> 14:39.360
All right, you first.

14:39.394 --> 14:41.295
Ah, I saw that.

14:42.297 --> 14:44.798
Nice.

14:44.833 --> 14:46.713
I know it's cheesy, but
thought you'd like it.

14:46.735 --> 14:48.602
Screw cheesy. I love it.

14:48.636 --> 14:51.338
In <i>México,</i> they would
call me Señor Queso.

14:51.373 --> 14:53.474
Look at this. Ah, man.

14:53.508 --> 14:55.309
I love it, man.

14:55.343 --> 14:57.711
You are going to kick ass
at that school.

14:57.746 --> 15:00.547
That's the plan.

15:00.582 --> 15:02.383
All right, my turn.

15:02.417 --> 15:05.152
Okay, so my gift to you is really big.

15:05.186 --> 15:06.854
It's too big to put under the tree.

15:06.888 --> 15:08.288
Curiosity piqued.

15:08.323 --> 15:11.024
Okay, so you can pick it up
at this address,

15:11.059 --> 15:13.227
and, you know, if you don't like it,

15:13.261 --> 15:14.695
you can return it.

15:25.006 --> 15:27.474
Package for Kurt Hummel.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.243
Blaine?

15:29.277 --> 15:30.544
Surprise.

15:30.578 --> 15:31.938
Your dad called me out of the blue

15:31.939 --> 15:33.147
and wanted to fly me out here

15:33.181 --> 15:34.681
just so I can see that look

15:34.716 --> 15:36.650
on your face, and it's
pretty priceless.

15:36.684 --> 15:38.485
Actually, he told me everything,

15:38.520 --> 15:40.921
and I promise, I'll keep
an eye on him for you.

15:40.955 --> 15:43.323
But the reason why I'm here

15:43.358 --> 15:45.692
is because he didn't
want us to miss out

15:45.727 --> 15:47.561
on another important holiday tradition.

15:47.595 --> 15:50.397
Our Christmas duet?

15:51.433 --> 15:53.600
You are happy to see me, right?

15:53.635 --> 15:57.004
Yeah, yeah. Always.

15:57.038 --> 15:58.939
Come on.
Get your skates on.

15:58.973 --> 16:00.607
It's almost midnight.

No matter what, no matter where,

17:44.879 --> 17:48.315
even if we're not together,

17:48.349 --> 17:51.552
we're always going to be there
for each other.

18:04.048 --> 18:05.349
Oh, hey, Puckerman, yo.

18:05.383 --> 18:06.616
You going African,

18:06.645 --> 18:08.285
or are you more Hebrew
for the holidays?

18:08.319 --> 18:09.919
Yeah, Hanukkah or Kwanzaa?
Which is it?

18:09.920 --> 18:11.088
Kwanukkah!

18:13.157 --> 18:14.391
Hey!

18:17.996 --> 18:19.596
Hey! One Puckerman
just ate your lunch.

18:19.630 --> 18:21.798
What do you think's going
to happen when we unload

18:21.800 --> 18:23.600
two barrels of Puckshot
into your ugly mugs?

18:27.839 --> 18:30.040
What are you looking at?

18:31.342 --> 18:32.976
What are you doing here?

18:33.011 --> 18:34.171
Just scoping out some chicks,

18:34.172 --> 18:35.892
doing a little research
for my screenplay.

18:35.893 --> 18:38.015
You're a screenwriter now?

18:38.049 --> 18:39.177
In L.A., you're nobody

18:39.178 --> 18:41.018
unless you're somebody
in the movie business.

18:41.052 --> 18:42.753
I'm almost done with my first script.

18:42.787 --> 18:45.422
It's sci-fi, but it has
a high school element.

18:45.456 --> 18:48.125
Wow. That sounds
really cool, actually.

18:48.159 --> 18:50.060
Well, if me being totally honest,

18:50.094 --> 18:52.195
I also came back to talk to you.

18:52.230 --> 18:54.164
I'm worried about you, dude.

18:54.198 --> 18:56.566
Well, I'm fine.

18:56.601 --> 18:58.969
Fine doesn't get into
fights in the hallway.

18:59.003 --> 19:01.443
Think what you need is a little
mentoring from your big bro.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.244
Come spend a few days
in La La Land with me.

19:03.245 --> 19:04.325
Let's do Hanukkah together.

19:04.326 --> 19:06.246
All you need is some cash
for gas and burritos.

19:06.277 --> 19:08.211
My hog has a sweet sidecar.

19:08.246 --> 19:09.913
Wait.

19:09.947 --> 19:12.182
You... you want me to ride

19:12.216 --> 19:14.651
all the way to California in a sidecar?

19:14.685 --> 19:15.965
Where's your sense of adventure?

19:28.966 --> 19:30.734
Noah Puckerman.

19:30.768 --> 19:32.436
There should be a
drive-on for us.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.671
That's what they call
a pass that you get

19:34.705 --> 19:36.740
when you're allowed
to drive on to the lot.

19:36.774 --> 19:38.942
It's a technical term.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.115
So, who's your meeting with?

19:45.149 --> 19:46.917
Is it about your screenplay?

19:46.951 --> 19:48.785
I'm just here networking today.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.120
Played with the sweater puppies

19:50.154 --> 19:52.289
of one of the assistants
of one of the guys

19:52.323 --> 19:54.791
who produces one of the <i>NCISes,</i>
and she got me the pass.

19:54.826 --> 19:57.794
Wow. You really are
making things happen.

19:57.829 --> 19:59.429
It was inevitable.

19:59.464 --> 20:01.731
If you're in Hollywood
and you're a Jew or a gay,

20:01.766 --> 20:04.468
you basically got it made.

20:04.502 --> 20:06.303
What are you doing?

20:06.337 --> 20:08.038
I told you... networking.

20:08.072 --> 20:10.974
We need to let all the
bigwigs here know who we are.

20:11.008 --> 20:13.276
Or, more specifically, what we are.

20:16.013 --> 20:19.749

Happy Hanukkah!

22:06.224 --> 22:07.424
I can't believe

22:07.458 --> 22:09.059
that this is where you live.

22:09.093 --> 22:10.594
No, I'm just renting.

22:10.628 --> 22:13.096
I think if I buy,
I'd want to be up in the hills.

22:13.130 --> 22:15.365
One of those houses they shoot porn in.

22:15.399 --> 22:17.234
Excuse me.

22:17.268 --> 22:20.170
Aren't you the guy who cleans our pool?

22:20.204 --> 22:21.705
Yeah, Mrs. Cross, hey.

22:21.739 --> 22:23.499
I thought you were
in Hawaii for Christmas.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.674
Yeah, we came back early.

22:24.709 --> 22:27.344
You have five minutes
till I call the police.

22:27.378 --> 22:28.968
Dude, why did you lie to me?

22:28.969 --> 22:30.969
I didn't think you'd be
impressed by my apartment

22:30.970 --> 22:32.610
in the Valley
filled with Ikea furniture

22:32.611 --> 22:34.251
I never figured out
how to put together.

22:34.252 --> 22:36.692
So all that screenwriter stuff...
is that just garbage, too?

22:36.693 --> 22:38.533
Figured it was my only chance
to convince you

22:38.534 --> 22:39.734
to come move out here with me.

22:39.735 --> 22:40.575
I'm a sophomore, man.

22:40.576 --> 22:41.776
I mean, I had to lie to my mom

22:41.777 --> 22:44.017
and tell her I was going on
vacation in Fort Lauderdale

22:44.018 --> 22:46.298
with Ryder and his family
just to get out here for this.

22:46.299 --> 22:47.864
I'm a mess out here, dude.

22:47.898 --> 22:49.633
It's lonely.
I've got no friends.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.067
It's impossible to meet people

22:51.102 --> 22:53.069
'cause you spend
the whole day in your car.

22:53.104 --> 22:54.738
Why didn't you just tell me that?

22:54.772 --> 22:56.039
We are family.

22:56.073 --> 22:57.374
I mean, I would've understood.

22:57.408 --> 22:59.376
That your big brother is a loser?

22:59.410 --> 23:01.244
Let's go back to Lima.

23:01.279 --> 23:02.539
If we leave this afternoon,

23:02.540 --> 23:03.980
we'll make it back by Christmas Eve.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.448
If I go back, my mom's gonna make me

23:05.449 --> 23:07.209
go to Breadstix
for dinner on Christmas Day

23:07.210 --> 23:09.370
while my sister hangs out
with her Christian friends.

23:09.371 --> 23:10.620
Cool. I'll go, too.

23:10.655 --> 23:12.756
And I'll invite my mom.

23:12.790 --> 23:14.724
My mom hates your mom.

23:14.759 --> 23:16.893
Your mom hasn't ever even met my mom.

23:16.927 --> 23:19.562
You feel lonely, you want
this feeling of family.

23:19.597 --> 23:23.500
Fine, then let's you and
I... we'll make it happen.

23:37.014 --> 23:38.581
Thanks.

23:38.616 --> 23:40.116
How great is this lasagna?

23:40.151 --> 23:41.584
I saw you once, you know.

23:41.619 --> 23:43.520
I came into that diner
you were working at

23:43.554 --> 23:45.088
after he told me about you.

23:45.122 --> 23:46.856
You waited on me.

23:46.891 --> 23:48.825
Acted like you had no idea who I was.

23:48.859 --> 23:51.494
I didn't.

23:51.529 --> 23:53.163
He never told me he was married.

23:53.197 --> 23:55.365
He did not wear his ring
when we were together.

23:55.399 --> 23:57.119
Is that how you make
yourself feel better?

23:57.120 --> 23:58.435
Stop it.

23:58.469 --> 24:00.103
He split on both of you.

24:00.137 --> 24:01.937
You spent all these years
hating each other,

24:01.938 --> 24:03.218
keeping me and my brother apart,

24:03.219 --> 24:04.174
and for what?

24:04.208 --> 24:05.342
To spite some jerk

24:05.376 --> 24:07.177
who never loved any of us?

24:07.211 --> 24:08.345
Puck's right.

24:08.379 --> 24:09.813
We all have one thing in common:

24:09.847 --> 24:11.314
He ran out on all of us.

24:11.349 --> 24:13.550
This week with Puck was...

24:13.584 --> 24:14.951
ridiculous,

24:14.985 --> 24:16.186
but it felt different

24:16.220 --> 24:17.854
than being with a friend.

24:19.090 --> 24:21.858
We're a family. Okay?

24:21.892 --> 24:25.829
A pretty messed up one,
but still a family.

24:29.934 --> 24:31.501
Your father really was an ass.

24:31.535 --> 24:33.069
An epic ass.

24:33.104 --> 24:34.371
So let's drink a toast.

24:34.405 --> 24:35.705
Yes, let's.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.741
To the power of the holidays,

24:37.775 --> 24:42.178
to new traditions and to an epic ass

24:42.213 --> 24:45.315
that did one thing right:

24:45.349 --> 24:46.750
He brought us together.

24:46.784 --> 24:48.618
Cheers.
Cheers.

24:50.087 --> 24:51.154
Merry Hanukkah, dude.

24:51.188 --> 24:53.623
Right back at you, bro.

25:02.381 --> 25:03.748
Hi, Marley.

25:03.782 --> 25:05.783
Here's a Rolex.
Merry Christmas.

25:09.721 --> 25:11.322
Hi, Ryder.

25:11.356 --> 25:14.258
Here's a three-week vacation
to Saint-Tropez.

25:14.293 --> 25:16.294
What?
Enjoy.

25:18.897 --> 25:19.864
Boop.

25:19.898 --> 25:21.565
What's this?

25:21.600 --> 25:25.002
Those are the keys to your
brand-new 2013 Toyota Camry.

25:25.037 --> 25:27.705
Brittany, what are you doing?

25:27.739 --> 25:29.907
Um, well, last week, I decided to watch

25:29.942 --> 25:31.842
a documentary about
the Mayan Apocalypse,

25:31.877 --> 25:34.512
which arrives on December 21, 2012.

25:34.546 --> 25:37.448
So I decided to cash in all
my savings so my friends and I

25:37.482 --> 25:40.084
could enjoy what's left
of our lives to the fullest.

25:40.118 --> 25:41.719
Enjoy.

25:41.753 --> 25:43.087
Merry Christmas, everybody.

25:47.659 --> 25:49.060
Hey, Brittany.

25:49.094 --> 25:50.261
Um, can I ask you a question?

25:50.295 --> 25:51.696
Yeah, not if you're gonna tell me

25:51.730 --> 25:53.531
that the Mayan Apocalypse isn't real.

25:53.559 --> 25:55.999
'Cause the documentary I watched
was on the History Channel,

25:56.000 --> 25:57.840
involving real actors
portraying real events.

25:57.841 --> 25:58.281
No, listen.

25:59.071 --> 26:00.972
I believe it, too.

26:01.006 --> 26:02.740
Fact.

26:02.774 --> 26:04.174
2012 is the year
that Kim Il-Sung,

26:04.175 --> 26:05.975
founder of North Korea,
would've turned 100.

26:05.976 --> 26:07.856
Divide 100 by ten, the
percentage of Americans

26:07.857 --> 26:10.137
that believe the world will
end on the 21st of December,

26:10.138 --> 26:11.978
and you get ten...
Mexico's rank in the world

26:11.979 --> 26:13.250
as a tourist destination...

26:13.285 --> 26:15.085
whose president expects
the Mayan Apocalypse

26:15.086 --> 26:16.887
to attract 52 million
people to his country.

26:16.922 --> 26:18.422
It's all right there.

26:18.457 --> 26:20.825
All anyone has to do
is look at the numbers.

26:20.859 --> 26:23.227
I'm terrified.

26:23.261 --> 26:25.741
And we need to purify ourselves
for the last day of b'ak'tun,

26:25.742 --> 26:28.566
the 144,000-day cycle
of the Mayan Calendar.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.468
Totally. We need to tell
everyone we know

26:30.502 --> 26:32.003
how we really feel about them.

26:33.338 --> 26:35.606
You guys, welcome to the first meeting

26:35.640 --> 26:37.842
of the 2012 Mayan Apocalypse Club.

26:37.876 --> 26:39.443
Wait, that's what this is?

26:39.478 --> 26:41.118
Don't worry,
it's also the last meeting.

26:41.119 --> 26:42.613
Because we're all so close,

26:42.647 --> 26:44.007
Sam and I wanted to bring you here

26:44.008 --> 26:46.328
so we could finally tell you
our true feelings about you.

26:46.329 --> 26:46.984
Tina,

26:47.019 --> 26:48.452
acting is a pipe dream for you,

26:48.487 --> 26:50.354
and your decision
to pursue it as a career

26:50.389 --> 26:52.089
is both irresponsible and shocking.

26:52.124 --> 26:54.692
Joe, you haven't really made
much of an impression on me,

26:54.726 --> 26:56.861
and I don't really know
what your deal is.

26:56.895 --> 26:59.130
Wait a second.
This is the worst club ever.

26:59.164 --> 27:01.632
We're not gonna just sit here
and let you insult us.

27:01.666 --> 27:03.746
I wasn't gonna insult you;
All I wanted to tell you

27:03.747 --> 27:05.147
was that I think you're delightful.

27:05.148 --> 27:07.548
Guys, you can't leave yet;
You're gonna miss the best part!

27:07.549 --> 27:08.869
Okay, merry Christmas to you two.

27:08.870 --> 27:09.910
Guys, we're not even gonna

27:09.911 --> 27:12.276
make it to Christmas!

27:12.310 --> 27:13.944
I can't believe how naive they are.

27:13.979 --> 27:15.446
I know.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.648
Some people just can't face
the cold, hard fact

27:17.682 --> 27:20.451
that this earth is really just
the back of a giant crocodile

27:20.485 --> 27:22.820
that's destroyed and
recreated every 500 years.

27:22.854 --> 27:24.655
Well, at least we have each other.

27:24.689 --> 27:26.791
Yeah.

27:26.825 --> 27:28.865
And since the world
is gonna end before Christmas,

27:28.866 --> 27:31.362
in the meantime, this will have to do.

And here's another rock.

29:16.535 --> 29:17.735
Brittany,

29:17.769 --> 29:20.004
before the world ends,

29:20.038 --> 29:22.506
will you marry me?

29:24.476 --> 29:26.196
Are you sure you're
qualified to marry us?

29:26.197 --> 29:27.645
You betcha, kiddo.

29:27.679 --> 29:29.647
I went on a Mayan Church Web site

29:29.681 --> 29:33.083
and I got ordained... if you're
really serious about doing this.

29:33.118 --> 29:35.352
Yeah. I want Brittany and I
to meet Q'uq'umatz,

29:35.387 --> 29:37.354
the feathered snake god, together.

29:38.390 --> 29:40.124
Put your hands here.

29:43.695 --> 29:47.164
Brittany, I've always thought
you were super hot

29:47.199 --> 29:50.267
and really smart,

29:50.302 --> 29:53.204
but what I didn't know was
that you were going to end up

29:53.238 --> 29:55.206
being my soul mate.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.308
Who knows what the future holds for us?

29:57.342 --> 30:01.011
Probably tsunamis
and horrible sea monsters.

30:01.046 --> 30:05.249
But now I'm not worried
about that, because I have you.

30:07.319 --> 30:10.154
Sam, when you first
joined the glee club,

30:10.188 --> 30:13.357
I didn't notice for a while.

30:13.391 --> 30:16.126
It wasn't until you did
a Rich Little impression

30:16.161 --> 30:19.029
and then told me it was
a Rich Little impression

30:19.064 --> 30:21.332
and explained who Rich Little was

30:21.366 --> 30:24.435
that I just... I knew
you were special.

30:25.770 --> 30:27.805
And I can't tell you how excited I am

30:27.839 --> 30:29.506
to become your Mayan star-wife.

30:29.541 --> 30:31.041
You may kiss your bride.

30:41.386 --> 30:43.153
It's December 18.

30:43.188 --> 30:44.788
Three days till the end.

30:46.424 --> 30:47.858
Let's make this time count.

30:57.569 --> 30:59.970
Brittany.

31:00.005 --> 31:01.805
It's December 22.

31:03.708 --> 31:05.876
We survived the Mayan Apocalypse.

31:05.910 --> 31:07.778
You know what this means?

31:07.812 --> 31:09.013
The world didn't end.

31:09.047 --> 31:11.048
We're also married.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.893
You know, I hate to ask you something

31:19.927 --> 31:21.461
during your midday ritual of devouring

31:21.496 --> 31:23.663
an entire animal carcass,
so here goes nothing.

31:23.698 --> 31:25.131
What's going on here?

31:25.166 --> 31:27.801
It's the faculty and staff
Secret Santa!

31:27.835 --> 31:30.504
And you really couldn't
swallow first, could you?

31:34.509 --> 31:35.742
Millie Rose.

31:35.776 --> 31:37.244
Who the hell's Millie Rose?

31:37.278 --> 31:40.347
She's a sweetheart.
She works in the cafeteria.

31:40.381 --> 31:45.085
She's a big lady, and I think
her daughter's in the glee club.

31:48.723 --> 31:50.857
How about this one?

32:00.234 --> 32:02.936
Becky, it's a beautiful
sweater from Benetton.

32:02.970 --> 32:04.204
Epic fail!

32:04.238 --> 32:06.706
I already got one of these, Coach!

32:06.741 --> 32:09.109
Get me something I don't already have!

32:09.143 --> 32:11.344
Like what?
Like a hot date!

32:11.379 --> 32:14.014
Or a snowmobile!

32:14.048 --> 32:16.483
Oh, Becky, you're not the only
person I have to shop for.

32:16.517 --> 32:19.286
I got to get something for that
hideous wad of a lunch lady,

32:19.320 --> 32:21.388
who somehow was able to squeeze out

32:21.422 --> 32:23.723
a ravishing,
golden-throated,

32:23.758 --> 32:27.027
raven-haired beauty from
those monstrous, gaping loins.

32:28.763 --> 32:31.831
What do you get the woman
who's eaten everything?

32:33.267 --> 32:36.570
Just to be clear,
no presents this year.

32:36.604 --> 32:38.004
That money is going to a therapist

32:38.039 --> 32:39.839
who specializes in eating disorders.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.474
We're not playing around here.

32:41.509 --> 32:42.576
I know, Mom.

32:42.610 --> 32:44.077
I know this is serious.

32:44.111 --> 32:47.380
I have a problem,
and I want to get better.

32:47.415 --> 32:50.984
Besides, we don't really need anything.

32:51.018 --> 32:52.319
Not even a tree?

32:52.353 --> 32:54.487
Marley...

32:54.522 --> 32:56.723
a tree is $50,

32:56.757 --> 33:00.093
and a session with
Dr. Goodsitt is $200.

33:00.127 --> 33:03.096
I don't need to tell you that
I don't make a lot of money.

33:03.130 --> 33:05.265
I will be damned if
I waste a penny of it

33:05.299 --> 33:07.200
before my daughter is healthy enough

33:07.234 --> 33:10.036
to realize what
a beautiful miracle she is.

33:13.708 --> 33:16.042
Sorry.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.445
If you want to give me a gift,

33:18.479 --> 33:20.880
sing me something.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.150

34:08.763 --> 34:10.897
That, right there,

34:10.931 --> 34:14.467
is the best Christmas gift
I have ever gotten.

34:24.277 --> 34:25.745
Well, Becky,

34:25.780 --> 34:27.914
I feel absolutely horrible.

34:27.947 --> 34:30.583
I've become selfish and spoiled,

34:30.618 --> 34:32.752
and incredibly out of touch.

34:32.786 --> 34:34.120
Look at this tree.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.489
Yes, it has a stark beauty all its own.

34:36.524 --> 34:38.591
But did I really need to cut down

34:38.626 --> 34:41.161
a 7,000-year-old
bristlecone pine

34:41.195 --> 34:43.096
just to hang ornaments on it?

34:43.130 --> 34:45.098
It just seems frivolous.

34:45.132 --> 34:47.033
Becky, I just made a call

34:47.068 --> 34:48.768
to a guy in the antiquities business.

34:48.803 --> 34:52.304
He's got contacts in the
luxury toothpick market.

34:52.339 --> 34:54.007
You and I are gonna sell him this tree,

34:54.041 --> 34:55.809
and we're going to give the proceeds

34:55.842 --> 34:59.479
to a very important cause.

35:01.916 --> 35:03.983
Marley? Marley!

35:04.018 --> 35:06.419
Marley, get down here, sweetie.

35:10.725 --> 35:12.158
Oh, my God.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.860
I know.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.470
Yeah, the back door was jimmied open,

35:15.471 --> 35:17.831
I was gonna call the police,
and then I saw all this. Mom.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.466
Look at this sweater.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.234
It's... I think
it's from Benetton.

35:21.268 --> 35:22.836
Oh, sweet Lord...

35:24.672 --> 35:27.540
I am gonna pass out. Marley...
Oh, my God.

35:27.575 --> 35:29.042
Marley, there's $800 here.

35:29.076 --> 35:31.311
Oh, my God.

35:31.345 --> 35:33.980
Merry Christmas, Mom!

35:34.014 --> 35:36.416
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

35:41.889 --> 35:44.758
We should probably
still call the police.

35:47.323 --> 35:49.043
I actually think I
knew it was really over

35:49.044 --> 35:51.426
when he tried to pick
up on my sister...

35:51.460 --> 35:53.662
at her baby shower.

35:55.965 --> 35:58.542
Aw, look at 'em.

35:58.578 --> 36:01.914
Laughing, trading war
stories about us kids.

36:01.948 --> 36:04.083
It's a true Hanukkah miracle.

36:04.117 --> 36:07.286
You know, I'm really gonna miss
you when you go back to L.A.

36:08.555 --> 36:10.656
I was thinking about that.

36:10.690 --> 36:12.925
I mean, I'm a screenwriter.
I can write anywhere.

36:12.959 --> 36:15.561
And I'm sure most of my
pool-cleaning clients in Lima

36:15.595 --> 36:16.862
would take me back, so...

36:16.896 --> 36:18.197
So you're moving back home?

36:18.231 --> 36:20.733
L.A. is great, but...

36:20.767 --> 36:23.035
someone needs to look
after you and our moms.

36:25.438 --> 36:27.206
So we're not actually married.

36:27.240 --> 36:30.342
There aren't actually
any Mayan church Web sites.

36:30.377 --> 36:32.244
The Mayans were wiped out 500 years ago

36:32.278 --> 36:34.513
by the conquistadors and smallpox.

36:34.547 --> 36:36.749
That's like chickenpox, but smaller.

36:36.783 --> 36:39.051
Look, when I heard the two
of you were getting engaged,

36:39.066 --> 36:40.786
I thought to myself,
these kids are two...

36:40.820 --> 36:43.789
special kids.

36:43.823 --> 36:46.925
The last thing we need
is another teen tragedy

36:46.960 --> 36:48.560
of marrying too young,

36:48.595 --> 36:50.683
popping out a couple kids
before you're 20

36:50.684 --> 36:52.364
and ending up with
your faces blurred out

36:52.399 --> 36:53.799
on an episode of <i>Cops.</i>

36:53.833 --> 36:55.534
I'm happy to have more time with Sam.

36:55.568 --> 36:57.608
I just... I feel empty
since the world didn't end.

36:57.609 --> 37:00.406
Yeah, like everything
was just so energized

37:00.440 --> 37:03.108
for those few days, and I felt
so close to everyone, and...

37:03.143 --> 37:06.078
It... it was really awesome.
I just miss that feeling.

37:08.440 --> 37:09.915
Hey, look at my phone.

37:09.941 --> 37:13.043
Huh. I got a Google alert
about the Mayan calendar.

37:13.078 --> 37:14.578
It says, uh...

37:14.621 --> 37:17.314
some archaeologist named Indiana Jones

37:17.348 --> 37:19.283
found a new Mayan calendar today.

37:19.325 --> 37:21.151
That's remarkable.

37:21.186 --> 37:24.054
Dr. Jones said that the new
end of the world date

37:24.089 --> 37:27.624
is September 27, 2014.

37:27.659 --> 37:29.019
That gives us like two whole years

37:29.020 --> 37:31.220
of giving love and brutal
honesty to everyone we know.

37:36.267 --> 37:37.468
So, who's winning?

37:37.502 --> 37:39.703
Celtics.
Celtics.

37:52.550 --> 37:54.585
Okay, I tried.

37:54.619 --> 37:56.954
Ah... 20 seconds.
Oh!

37:56.988 --> 37:58.789
Pay up, Anderson.

37:58.823 --> 38:00.924
You may have dated him,
but I raised him.

38:00.959 --> 38:02.627
I know my son.

38:02.628 --> 38:04.308
Aw, you couldn't have
just toughed it out

38:04.309 --> 38:05.669
for just a few more seconds, Kurt?

38:05.670 --> 38:06.830
No.
Just a few more seconds.

38:06.865 --> 38:08.665
So... graduating...

38:08.700 --> 38:10.100
Plans for the future?

38:10.135 --> 38:11.468
Uh... well...

38:11.503 --> 38:13.023
I haven't talked about this with Kurt,

38:13.024 --> 38:14.104
and I wouldn't do anything

38:14.139 --> 38:15.339
to make him uncomfortable,

38:15.373 --> 38:17.007
but I was thinking about

38:17.041 --> 38:18.842
applying to NYADA.

38:18.877 --> 38:20.744
Would that be okay?

38:22.013 --> 38:23.714
I think that'd be great.

38:26.151 --> 38:27.451
Me, too.

38:29.587 --> 38:31.227
Could I talk to you
for a second, Coach?

38:32.991 --> 38:35.826
I wanted to say thank you

38:35.860 --> 38:38.228
for what you did for Marley and me.

38:38.263 --> 38:39.943
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:39.978 --> 38:41.978
I had nothing to do
with the making of that film.

38:41.979 --> 38:43.339
I bribed Becky Jackson with candy,

38:43.340 --> 38:44.735
and she told me everything.

38:44.769 --> 38:46.370
You're very generous,

38:46.404 --> 38:49.873
but, um...

38:49.908 --> 38:54.478
I'm afraid I can't accept this money.

38:54.512 --> 38:56.213
Well, you and I both know

38:56.247 --> 38:58.115
how hard it is to be a single mother.

38:59.551 --> 39:02.153
So take the money,

39:02.154 --> 39:04.154
and make sure that daughter
of yours gets better.

39:04.189 --> 39:06.356
Is that understood?

39:06.391 --> 39:08.158
Now, if you'll excuse me,

39:08.193 --> 39:12.563
please sideways-step yourself
the hell out of my office.

39:13.798 --> 39:15.966
Uh... would you come with me?

39:17.135 --> 39:19.002
Marley wanted to say thank you, too.

39:19.037 --> 39:20.838
Does this involve the glee club

39:20.872 --> 39:22.906
singing a Christmas song
in the auditorium

39:22.941 --> 39:26.376
with snow falling
on an elaborate winter scene?

39:29.881 --> 39:33.283
Yep, okay. This is exactly
what I just described.

39:33.318 --> 39:36.687
Coach Sylvester, I wanted
to thank you for what you did.

39:36.721 --> 39:40.057
So I called Artie, and he
helped pull all this together.

39:40.091 --> 39:42.359
Well, it's a testament
to how little you know me

39:42.393 --> 39:45.062
if you think this
is something I would enjoy.
