WEBVTT

00:00.224 --> 00:01.350
Keep the police
out of it

00:01.425 --> 00:03.325
if you want to see
your husband alive again.

00:05.896 --> 00:08.729
You left $500,000

00:08.799 --> 00:10.630
in a crate
on the side of the road?

00:10.701 --> 00:11.929
It was ransom money,

00:12.003 --> 00:13.300
and those were
the instructions.

00:13.371 --> 00:16.271
Do you expect me to hop over
all 13 of these islands?

00:16.340 --> 00:18.171
That's the name of
your service, isn't it?

00:18.242 --> 00:20.005
Island Hoppers?

00:21.479 --> 00:22.810
Go, Kaholo!

00:22.880 --> 00:23.869
Where is she?

00:23.948 --> 00:25.415
He brought disgrace
to the family.

00:25.483 --> 00:28.213
My daughter is doing
the only honorable thing.

00:28.285 --> 00:29.513
Mitsue.

02:24.887 --> 02:26.354
Just think of it.

02:26.421 --> 02:28.389
All those shrimp
down there,

02:28.457 --> 02:30.049
just swimming around,

02:30.125 --> 02:32.116
waiting for somebody
to serve them up for dinner.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.458
Thousands and
thousands of 'em.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.663
You know what it
reminds me of?

02:36.732 --> 02:38.495
Did I ever tell
you about my run-in

02:38.567 --> 02:39.932
with African army ants?

02:41.403 --> 02:43.837
Talk about intelligence.
Not like these guys.

02:43.906 --> 02:45.533
If these shrimps
were like those ants,

02:45.607 --> 02:46.767
they'd be eatin' us.

02:46.842 --> 02:48.639
Huh, anyway,

02:49.144 --> 02:52.238
there I was
just lying in my tent.

02:59.988 --> 03:02.388
You're
a beautiful woman, Mitsue.

03:06.828 --> 03:08.762
Come on,
we better get goin'.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.127
I'll tell you what,

03:10.198 --> 03:12.029
after we go
see this property,

03:12.100 --> 03:14.625
why don't we go out,
have a real fancy dinner?

03:14.703 --> 03:17.467
Someplace where they charge
$10 for a cup of coffee

03:17.539 --> 03:18.801
and the waiter
would do anything

03:18.874 --> 03:20.239
but chew your food
for you.

03:23.946 --> 03:25.709
Good afternoon,
Mr. And Mrs. McWilliams.

03:25.781 --> 03:26.975
Hello, George.
How's your day?

03:27.049 --> 03:28.016
Ah, okay, thanks.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.573
I just wish it'd go
a little faster.

03:29.651 --> 03:30.675
Big plans
for the evening?

03:30.752 --> 03:31.719
You got it.

03:31.787 --> 03:33.277
You want me to take
that to the lab?

03:33.355 --> 03:34.322
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

03:34.389 --> 03:36.653
And remember, George,
moderation in everything.

03:36.725 --> 03:38.158
Mr. McWilliams,
coming from you...

03:41.897 --> 03:43.228
Thank you.

03:52.307 --> 03:54.366
Stay where you are!

03:55.844 --> 03:57.209
Don't move!

03:58.113 --> 03:59.307
Stay where you are!

03:59.381 --> 04:01.212
You, too, don't move!

04:01.283 --> 04:03.046
Now, take
your gun out slowly.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.348
Now, throw it
over there. Now!

04:07.990 --> 04:09.514
You will be called.

04:09.591 --> 04:10.922
Keep the police
out of it

04:10.993 --> 04:13.154
if you want to see
your husband alive again.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.623
Get on in! In!

04:28.276 --> 04:31.245
Dick! Dick, come back!

04:43.025 --> 04:44.788
You in big trouble, boy.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.794
How you gonna get
those tax forms in order

04:46.862 --> 04:48.022
by the 15th?

04:48.697 --> 04:50.688
Don't worry
about it, T.C.

04:50.866 --> 04:53.027
I got
everything under control.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.499
Well,
that's obvious.

04:55.704 --> 04:58.571
I ain't never seen
anyone so disorganized

04:58.640 --> 05:00.437
in my whole entire life.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.601
Look at this mess.

05:01.677 --> 05:02.905
Don't do that!

05:02.978 --> 05:04.275
Don't you have
to fly somebody

05:04.346 --> 05:05.540
somewhere or something?

05:05.614 --> 05:07.411
No.
Business is slow.

05:08.784 --> 05:10.251
You can't do that.

05:10.318 --> 05:11.307
Do what?

05:11.386 --> 05:13.286
You can't add
what's on line 70

05:13.355 --> 05:14.720
to what's
on line 60.

05:14.790 --> 05:16.018
But wait. T.C.,

05:16.091 --> 05:17.786
look right here.
It says "total."

05:17.859 --> 05:20.623
Uh, it's like adding
apples to oranges.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.163
What are you
talking about?

05:22.230 --> 05:23.663
Right there, T.C.,
it says "total."

05:23.732 --> 05:25.290
Yeah?
"Total," right there.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.336
You got to go back
to Page 3.

05:29.471 --> 05:30.802
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.930
Hey, Higgie baby.

05:32.007 --> 05:33.372
Hi, Higgins.

05:38.747 --> 05:40.044
You ought to patent

05:40.115 --> 05:41.810
this filing system
of yours, Magnum.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.475
Yeah,
it's a mystery to me

05:43.552 --> 05:45.019
how this man
can find anything.

05:45.087 --> 05:46.076
Huh.

05:46.822 --> 05:49.882
I must say,
this displays pure genius.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.222
Absolute
financial wizardry.

05:52.294 --> 05:54.125
No doubt
the Internal Revenue Service

05:54.196 --> 05:56.061
will be equally impressed.

05:56.331 --> 05:57.958
But why all the fuss?

05:58.033 --> 06:00.228
I should think it would
require no time at all

06:00.302 --> 06:02.827
to prepare the taxes
of one who has no income.

06:04.005 --> 06:06.735
Did you come here
for a reason, Higgins?

06:07.109 --> 06:09.441
There's a Mrs. McWilliams
in the living room

06:09.511 --> 06:11.001
who wishes
to see you.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.740
Maybe she wants T.M.
To do her taxes.

06:12.814 --> 06:13.940
Will you stop it!

06:14.015 --> 06:15.505
Why didn't you
just send her over?

06:15.584 --> 06:17.882
She'd prefer to see you alone.

06:39.574 --> 06:40.939
Hi, Mitsue.

06:41.510 --> 06:43.000
Hello, Thomas.

06:43.678 --> 06:44.872
Uh-oh,

06:45.180 --> 06:46.647
come on,
what's he done this time?

06:46.715 --> 06:48.239
Another fight?

06:48.617 --> 06:50.346
Somebody suing him?

06:53.455 --> 06:54.922
What's wrong?

06:57.592 --> 06:59.457
Dick's been kidnapped.

07:10.205 --> 07:13.402
<i>Rule 2 in kidnapping cases:</i>
<i>Never call the police.</i>

07:13.475 --> 07:14.533
<i>The truth is,</i>

07:14.609 --> 07:16.236
<i>you flip a coin and</i>
<i>take your chances.</i>

07:16.311 --> 07:18.370
<i>Since Mitsue wanted</i>
<i>to keep Five-O out of it,</i>

07:18.446 --> 07:20.073
<i>I decided to go along.</i>

07:20.148 --> 07:22.275
<i>At least for the time being.</i>

07:44.406 --> 07:46.636
Mitsue,
could I have some tea?

07:47.175 --> 07:48.506
Oh, of course.

07:48.577 --> 07:51.273
How rude of me not to offer.
I'm sorry.

07:57.786 --> 07:59.777
<i>was to keep Mitsue busy</i>
<i>until the call came.</i>

08:00.589 --> 08:02.682
<i>I'd known Dick</i>
<i>since our paths crossed</i>

08:02.757 --> 08:04.224
<i>in the Navy 10 years ago.</i>

08:04.292 --> 08:05.554
<i>He was a hell-raiser.</i>

08:05.627 --> 08:08.152
<i>Always at the bottom</i>
<i>of a practical joke</i>

08:08.230 --> 08:09.663
<i>or chasing a pretty woman.</i>

08:09.731 --> 08:11.289
<i>That was until</i>
<i>he married Mitsue.</i>

08:11.366 --> 08:12.890
<i>Then he laid off the women.</i>

08:12.968 --> 08:14.196
<i>I think.</i>

08:14.669 --> 08:16.500
<i>I remember his</i>
<i>tiny bachelor pad</i>

08:16.571 --> 08:17.595
<i>in Black Point.</i>

08:17.672 --> 08:21.005
<i>It was filled with trophies,</i>
<i>pictures, and Fred.</i>

08:21.509 --> 08:23.534
<i>Fred was the meanest</i>
<i>turtle I'd ever seen</i>

08:23.612 --> 08:25.204
<i>and Dick swears</i>
<i>he didn't catch him.</i>

08:25.280 --> 08:26.804
<i>It was the other way around.</i>

08:26.882 --> 08:29.407
<i>Knowing Dick,</i>
<i>he was probably right.</i>

08:34.022 --> 08:36.013
May I help you?

08:37.726 --> 08:40.422
Uh, yes.
I'm Thomas Magnum.

08:41.897 --> 08:45.264
I am Yoshio Nishimoto,
Mitsue's father.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.494
I speak English.

08:48.937 --> 08:50.928
Oh, well,
Mitsue asked me to help her.

08:51.006 --> 08:53.531
I'm waiting with her
for the kidnappers to call.

08:53.608 --> 08:54.802
Father.

08:55.944 --> 08:57.878
I thought you
were at the aquafarm.

08:57.946 --> 09:01.177
Why did you involve this man
in our private affairs?

09:01.249 --> 09:02.341
I'm a friend
of Dick's.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.577
I'm just here
to help, sir.

09:03.652 --> 09:06.382
I have no desire to see
Mr. McWilliams return.

09:06.454 --> 09:07.512
Father.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.523
I care nothing
for the man

09:09.591 --> 09:11.491
nor what becomes
of him.

09:11.893 --> 09:13.884
Mr. Nishimoto,
I think Dick's done

09:13.962 --> 09:15.896
a lot for you
and for your family.

09:15.964 --> 09:16.988
Such as?

09:17.065 --> 09:18.032
The aquafarm.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.794
The whole thing was
his idea, wasn't it?

09:20.969 --> 09:22.402
Mr. Magnum,

09:22.470 --> 09:24.995
we were hardly
poor fish peddlers.

09:25.573 --> 09:29.134
My son-in-law merely used
an already existing business

09:29.311 --> 09:32.212
and its money to further
his own ambitions.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.614
Perhaps Westerners
find that enterprising.

09:36.351 --> 09:37.613
I do not.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.983
Good day,
Mr. Magnum.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.986
Please.

09:50.231 --> 09:51.323
Mitsue,

09:51.399 --> 09:54.493
has your father always felt
that way about Dick?

09:55.971 --> 09:57.871
We're Japanese,
Thomas.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.172
He didn't want me
to marry Dick.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.309
I'm sorry.

10:05.547 --> 10:07.777
It is nothing
to be sorry for.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.246
It is the way it is.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.345
I am very happy
with Dick.

10:17.192 --> 10:18.682
Wait a minute.

10:19.127 --> 10:20.492
Do you have
an extension?

10:20.562 --> 10:21.859
In the dining room.

10:30.739 --> 10:31.899
Hello?

10:36.845 --> 10:38.244
<i>Put the money</i>
<i>in a small crate</i>

10:38.346 --> 10:40.280
<i>by the side of the road.</i>

10:40.348 --> 10:42.339
<i>Don't involve</i>
<i>the police.</i>

10:52.360 --> 10:53.691
Can you raise
that kind of money

10:53.762 --> 10:55.161
by tomorrow?

10:55.230 --> 10:57.130
Without
your father's help?

10:57.198 --> 10:58.256
Yes.

10:58.633 --> 11:01.796
Look, Mitsue, maybe we
better call the police.

11:04.005 --> 11:05.632
It might be
the safest thing.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.072
No, please.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.169
They'll kill him.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.011
All right.

11:14.416 --> 11:16.543
I'll be here
in the morning.

11:35.603 --> 11:36.592
Oh.

11:43.111 --> 11:45.306
How can anybody so tiny
weigh so much?

11:45.380 --> 11:46.904
It's the dress.

11:49.651 --> 11:51.141
Oh, look at this.

11:51.219 --> 11:53.380
I look like
a pale blue polar bear.

11:53.455 --> 11:55.116
Oh, Dick.

11:55.790 --> 11:58.281
How did you ever talk me
into renting this thing?

11:58.359 --> 12:01.226
Well, I think you look
very nice.

12:02.030 --> 12:03.793
Like a big ángel.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.027
Well,
this place isn't bad.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.498
But I'll bet you
that the bed is round

12:11.573 --> 12:13.803
and that
the bathtub is heart-shaped.

12:15.577 --> 12:16.566
Dick?

12:22.650 --> 12:23.742
Dick?

12:27.655 --> 12:29.247
I'm sorry, Mits.

12:30.758 --> 12:33.852
I never had any family,
but I know how you feel.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.432
I knew what I was doing.

12:40.068 --> 12:42.662
None of your family
showed up at all.

12:44.906 --> 12:46.737
It doesn't matter.

12:48.710 --> 12:50.610
It was still beautiful.

12:53.448 --> 12:54.437
Yeah.

12:55.016 --> 12:57.246
All that champagne left over.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.081
Couldn't let it go to waste.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.451
History, Mits.
You made history.

13:05.260 --> 13:06.727
You finally got
old Dick McWilliams

13:06.794 --> 13:07.852
to the altar.

13:07.929 --> 13:09.362
I never thought
you would,

13:09.430 --> 13:11.660
and none of
my pals did either.

13:13.368 --> 13:15.461
I hope
you don't regret it.

13:18.940 --> 13:20.567
Not if you don't.

13:23.311 --> 13:24.573
But I do.

13:25.647 --> 13:28.138
I'm scared.
I regret it like crazy.

13:31.619 --> 13:34.144
Until I remember
the woman I married.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.620
You're the only woman

13:38.126 --> 13:40.117
that I'd want to
change my life for.

13:41.663 --> 13:43.290
You've made me
think of a home

13:43.364 --> 13:45.229
as something more

13:45.433 --> 13:47.663
than a place
to leave my dirty socks.

13:51.272 --> 13:53.172
You make me
wish I was younger

13:53.241 --> 13:54.606
or better looking.

13:54.676 --> 13:56.143
Shh. Don't.

13:57.779 --> 13:59.144
I love you.

14:00.915 --> 14:03.247
And I love
everything about you.

14:10.992 --> 14:12.516
And I love you.

14:20.935 --> 14:24.996
Why don't we go and
act like newlyweds?

14:46.376 --> 14:48.139
<i>The stakes were getting higher,</i>

14:48.211 --> 14:50.577
<i>but Mitsue still didn't want</i>
<i>the police called in.</i>

14:50.647 --> 14:52.137
<i>As for my little voice,</i>

14:52.215 --> 14:54.547
<i>the trusty little voice</i>
<i>that tells me what to do,</i>

14:54.618 --> 14:57.086
<i>well, it was being</i>
<i>unusually quiet.</i>

14:57.153 --> 14:59.087
<i>That's the trouble</i>
<i>with little voices.</i>

14:59.155 --> 15:00.747
<i>No consistency.</i>

15:02.092 --> 15:03.354
You know, T.C.,
you forgot

15:03.426 --> 15:05.417
to deduct leasing costs
and business expenses.

15:06.630 --> 15:09.030
What do you mean,
leasing costs and business expenses?

15:09.099 --> 15:11.192
Well, the Ferrari,
for one.

15:11.601 --> 15:13.796
Robin Masters lets
him use the Ferrari

15:13.870 --> 15:15.098
free of charge.

15:15.238 --> 15:16.762
Yeah, that's right.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.501
Well, you could say
this is his office.

15:18.575 --> 15:19.633
That's rent.

15:19.709 --> 15:21.574
He don't pay
no rent.

15:21.645 --> 15:22.669
Hmm.

15:22.746 --> 15:24.577
Well, what about
redecorating expenses

15:24.648 --> 15:27.515
like new carpeting, paint,
new lighting fixtures?

15:27.584 --> 15:29.211
What about
furniture expenses,

15:29.286 --> 15:30.378
like the desk
that he uses,

15:30.453 --> 15:32.478
the sofa that
his clients sit on,

15:32.556 --> 15:33.955
and the bed?

15:34.991 --> 15:38.051
How can you list the bed
as a business expense?

15:38.528 --> 15:40.519
List it
as entertainment.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.389
Hi, guys.

15:44.467 --> 15:45.434
Hey.

15:45.502 --> 15:46.491
Hi, Thomas.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.594
I need your help.

15:47.671 --> 15:48.660
For what?

15:49.272 --> 15:50.261
Well,

15:51.074 --> 15:53.406
I'll tell you.
Uh, it's nothing big.

15:55.645 --> 15:58.637
I just need you to
help me deliver $500,000.

16:22.839 --> 16:24.864
This is Red Dog.
Charlie spotted.

16:24.941 --> 16:27.102
Masked man riding
yellow Bronco. Over.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.777
Could you make
the license-plate number?

16:38.021 --> 16:39.784
Negative. No plates.

16:41.191 --> 16:42.453
Terrific.

18:14.651 --> 18:16.380
He didn't come out.

18:16.619 --> 18:18.052
Where did it go?

18:18.121 --> 18:20.282
I don't know.
It's gotta be in there.

18:20.356 --> 18:23.257
Lower this thing.
I want to take a peek, T.C.

18:34.771 --> 18:36.170
A peek, huh?

18:45.115 --> 18:46.514
There he is.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.448
Must have made a switch.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.954
He's gotta be in
one of those cars

18:53.022 --> 18:54.182
that just went through.

18:54.257 --> 18:55.554
Great. Which one?

18:55.625 --> 18:56.592
I don't know.

18:56.659 --> 18:58.854
Follow them all
till I ID 'em.

19:26.489 --> 19:28.116
T.C.,
I can't read the numbers

19:28.224 --> 19:29.521
when you rock the chopper.

19:29.592 --> 19:32.288
Well, pardon me
all to hell.

19:32.829 --> 19:36.492
Does that plate look like
DPL or, or OPL?

19:36.633 --> 19:38.157
Well, I can't tell.

19:38.234 --> 19:40.065
I'm busy not rocking
the chopper.

20:04.260 --> 20:06.285
<i>despite T.C. 's rocky ride.</i>

20:06.529 --> 20:08.360
<i>Now, all I had to</i>
<i>do was run them down</i>

20:08.431 --> 20:11.229
<i>and see which one came</i>
<i>closest to being a kidnapper.</i>

20:11.301 --> 20:13.531
<i>It would be</i>
<i>a very tedious job.</i>

20:13.736 --> 20:15.704
<i>I put Rick and T.C. On it.</i>

20:15.772 --> 20:18.002
<i>They thought I handed them</i>
<i>the lousy job,</i>

20:18.074 --> 20:20.133
<i>but believe me,</i>
<i>nothing was as bad</i>

20:20.210 --> 20:22.235
<i>as waiting for</i>
<i>the phone to ring.</i>

20:22.712 --> 20:25.237
Why are they
taking so long to call?

20:25.515 --> 20:27.107
Perhaps,
you and your friend Magnum

20:27.183 --> 20:29.344
gave our money away
for nothing.

20:29.419 --> 20:31.444
You know,
you're really something.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.852
You may not like Dick,

20:32.922 --> 20:34.480
but he's your
daughter's husband.

20:34.557 --> 20:37.048
That is not
a marriage I approved.

20:37.126 --> 20:38.320
So you torture her

20:38.394 --> 20:40.021
when she's
scared and in pain?

20:41.297 --> 20:42.787
Speak English!

20:56.246 --> 20:57.907
Thank you, Thomas.

21:07.223 --> 21:08.383
Out!

21:09.459 --> 21:11.188
Yeah, yeah, Shakey,
I'm holding.

21:11.261 --> 21:12.250
I'm holding.

21:12.328 --> 21:14.193
Will you just
cut off the music?

21:15.265 --> 21:16.357
Just what I need,

21:16.432 --> 21:18.730
another 10 minutes
of <i>Downtown</i> by violinists.

21:18.835 --> 21:20.359
How did you do?

21:20.536 --> 21:22.003
Ah, I don't know.

21:22.071 --> 21:24.369
How can you tell if
someone's a kidnapper or not?

21:24.440 --> 21:26.237
You mean you didn't check
those names out?

21:26.309 --> 21:28.243
Of course
I checked them out.

21:28.311 --> 21:30.836
The first one
was a cop with Five-O.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.939
Figured he
probably wasn't our man.

21:33.016 --> 21:34.881
Well, what was
his name?

21:35.585 --> 21:36.916
McGarrett.

21:38.655 --> 21:42.557
Oh, yeah, then next, uh,
was a dental hygienist.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.990
Man, she had
the prettiest white...

21:45.061 --> 21:46.551
Hold on, Shakey.
Hold on a minute.

21:46.629 --> 21:48.494
What about
the dental hygienist?

21:48.564 --> 21:50.498
Small apartment
somewhere.

21:50.566 --> 21:52.466
Sounds okay.
I don't know.

21:52.769 --> 21:53.861
Give me her name.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.370
I'll have Shakey
check 'em out.

21:55.438 --> 21:56.632
Shakey?

21:56.873 --> 21:58.397
He's a sergeant
with the HPD.

21:58.474 --> 21:59.736
He owes me some favors.

21:59.809 --> 22:01.674
Shakey? Shakey.
Yeah, listen...

22:01.778 --> 22:03.507
You mean the whole time
I've been running

22:03.579 --> 22:05.376
all over Honolulu
looking up these people,

22:05.448 --> 22:07.678
you been sitting right here,
doing it on the phone?

22:07.750 --> 22:09.342
Hey, I've been out, too,
okay?

22:09.419 --> 22:11.284
What happened
to your eye?

22:16.859 --> 22:17.917
Who gave you that?

22:17.994 --> 22:20.155
Shakey, Shakey,
don't hang up, now.

22:20.229 --> 22:22.094
I want you to check
one other thing for me,

22:22.165 --> 22:23.291
run it down for me.

22:23.366 --> 22:24.424
Yes.

22:24.767 --> 22:27.634
Mable Page.
P- A-G-E.

22:28.171 --> 22:30.696
166 Oahu Street.

22:31.207 --> 22:34.108
166. Apartment 6-B.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.908
And, uh, Shakey.
Shakey?

22:38.081 --> 22:40.515
How does HPD
afford music on hold?

22:40.616 --> 22:42.777
It's not a real orchestra,
you know.

22:42.852 --> 22:45.082
They put those
things on tape.

22:45.688 --> 22:47.986
T.C., you can make
dumb remarks all day long

22:48.057 --> 22:49.820
and I still ain't
gonna tell you.

22:56.299 --> 22:58.199
<i>there was still</i>
<i>no word on Dick.</i>

22:58.267 --> 23:01.202
<i>So when T.C. And Rick came up</i>
<i>with two possible suspects,</i>

23:01.270 --> 23:03.397
<i>I decided to check them out.</i>

23:03.840 --> 23:04.898
<i>Rick wouldn't tell me</i>

23:04.974 --> 23:06.908
<i>which one gave</i>
<i>him the black eye.</i>

23:49.385 --> 23:50.579
Gloria Bauer?

23:50.653 --> 23:51.642
Don't know you.

23:51.721 --> 23:52.813
Oh, wait a minute.

23:52.889 --> 23:55.119
Excuse me.
How can you be sure?

23:55.425 --> 23:57.825
Nope.
I'd remember you.

23:58.428 --> 23:59.656
What do you want?

23:59.729 --> 24:01.492
Well, may I come in?

24:05.334 --> 24:07.097
Go ahead, sit down.

24:15.211 --> 24:16.542
Miss Bauer.

24:16.612 --> 24:18.739
Gloria.
And what's your name?

24:20.249 --> 24:21.739
Magnum.
Thomas Magnum.

24:23.586 --> 24:26.111
Like a big
bottle of champagne.

24:27.223 --> 24:29.691
Do you own
a 1974 blue sedan?

24:30.326 --> 24:32.556
License number
AFF444?

24:33.029 --> 24:35.122
It's about those damn
parking tickets, isn't it?

24:35.198 --> 24:36.460
No, it's not about
any tickets.

24:36.532 --> 24:38.022
I told you people
1,000 times,

24:38.101 --> 24:39.728
that parking meter
out there is broken.

24:39.802 --> 24:41.667
I don't know anything
about any tickets.

24:42.071 --> 24:43.265
Honest.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.940
So what are you asking me
about my car for?

24:47.009 --> 24:48.772
Then it is your car?

24:49.278 --> 24:51.746
Doesn't do me any good.
I can't drive the thing.

24:51.814 --> 24:53.782
Not with gas
as high as it is.

24:53.850 --> 24:55.909
Oh, did you
drive it today?

24:56.986 --> 24:59.113
Nope.
Not yesterday either.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.488
Miss Bauer.

25:02.625 --> 25:03.819
Gloria.

25:04.827 --> 25:06.351
Uh, your car
was seen

25:06.429 --> 25:08.693
on the road
today about 12:00.

25:10.833 --> 25:13.233
Damn jerk.
Borrowed it again.

25:13.369 --> 25:15.462
He's always
borrowing without asking.

25:15.538 --> 25:16.596
Who?

25:18.174 --> 25:19.402
Kaholo.

25:20.076 --> 25:21.839
The love of my life.

25:28.183 --> 25:31.516
You left $500,000 in a crate

25:31.586 --> 25:32.780
on the side of the road?

25:32.854 --> 25:34.617
Higgins, will you
just forget about that?

25:34.689 --> 25:37.681
$500,000.
Are you mad?

25:38.160 --> 25:39.354
Don't answer that.

25:39.428 --> 25:40.861
It was ransom money,

25:40.929 --> 25:42.260
and those were
the instructions.

25:42.330 --> 25:43.319
What would you do?

25:43.398 --> 25:44.422
Without question,

25:44.499 --> 25:45.830
I would have
involved the police

25:45.901 --> 25:47.630
or at least have
the assailants followed.

25:47.702 --> 25:48.999
That's what
T.C. And I did,

25:49.071 --> 25:51.539
except the assailants
turned out to be pretty smart

25:51.606 --> 25:53.369
and they switched
vehicles in a tunnel.

25:53.442 --> 25:54.807
And then we had to
track down

25:54.876 --> 25:56.935
each and every vehicle
that came out of the tunnel.

25:57.012 --> 25:58.912
And then when I finally
found the kidnapper,

25:58.980 --> 26:00.504
well, it was
actually his girlfriend,

26:00.582 --> 26:03.278
he turned out to be
a friend of Dick's.

26:04.119 --> 26:07.179
Nothing is ever simple
with you, Magnum, is it?

26:07.422 --> 26:09.822
Will you just
answer my question

26:09.891 --> 26:11.085
please?

26:13.862 --> 26:15.955
During the last
fiscal year,

26:16.565 --> 26:18.795
Nishimoto's profits soared

26:20.001 --> 26:22.333
39.6 percent.

26:23.538 --> 26:26.166
In addition, they received
a handsome premium

26:26.241 --> 26:29.267
from their merger
with Emerald Sea Foods, Inc.

26:29.344 --> 26:31.175
Emerald Sea stockholders
were offered

26:31.246 --> 26:33.146
cash or stock in Nishimoto.

26:33.215 --> 26:34.773
Naturally,
most preferred stock

26:34.850 --> 26:37.284
since the cash would be
immediately taxable.

26:37.352 --> 26:38.512
I would estimate

26:38.587 --> 26:39.986
Mr. McWilliams'
personal income,

26:40.055 --> 26:42.819
what with the profits,
premium and merger,

26:42.891 --> 26:44.654
and of course a salary raise,

26:44.726 --> 26:46.660
to have risen tenfold.

26:47.596 --> 26:48.858
So the taxes
he'd pay...

26:48.930 --> 26:51.398
Mr. McWilliams would,
as the saying goes,

26:51.466 --> 26:53.934
be taken to the cleaners
by your Uncle Sam.

26:54.002 --> 26:57.096
Unless, of course,
he has sufficient deductions.

26:57.572 --> 26:58.732
Maybe he found

26:58.807 --> 27:00.331
the biggest deduction
of all.

27:01.009 --> 27:02.909
You think
he kidnapped himself?

27:02.978 --> 27:05.037
$500,000 of
undeclared income,

27:05.113 --> 27:07.138
and nobody gets hurt
but my Uncle Sam?

27:08.383 --> 27:09.577
Maybe...

27:09.918 --> 27:10.907
Yes?

27:12.320 --> 27:13.810
Dick was the kind of guy

27:13.889 --> 27:17.381
who never could stay with anything,
or anyone, too long.

27:18.326 --> 27:20.021
Maybe this was his ticket out.

27:20.095 --> 27:22.791
I just hope
his wife is in on it.

27:23.899 --> 27:25.867
His ticket out of what?

27:38.246 --> 27:39.235
Dick!

27:39.748 --> 27:40.806
Dick!

27:41.082 --> 27:42.572
Dick. Dick.

27:43.251 --> 27:45.481
Decided to hibernate
with me after all, huh?

27:45.554 --> 27:47.681
Some guy came
visiting Gloria today.

27:47.756 --> 27:51.157
Tall, moustache.
I don't know.

27:51.726 --> 27:53.489
Gloria,
she's sauced again.

27:53.628 --> 27:56.096
Could hardly understand
a word she said.

27:56.164 --> 27:57.461
Well, what happened?

27:57.532 --> 28:00.433
He wanted to know who was
driving her car yesterday.

28:00.602 --> 28:01.967
Doesn't mean anything.

28:02.037 --> 28:03.265
This guy
meant business.

28:03.338 --> 28:05.704
I think he was waiving
a gun in Gloria's face

28:05.774 --> 28:09.039
'cause she kept muttering
something about a Magnum.

28:09.544 --> 28:11.637
Oh, damn.

28:12.347 --> 28:13.439
What?

28:17.219 --> 28:18.880
Mitsue called Tom.

28:19.387 --> 28:20.445
Who?

28:21.756 --> 28:23.246
Thomas Magnum.

28:23.825 --> 28:25.918
He's an old
Navy buddy of mine.

28:25.994 --> 28:27.825
But he's a detective now.

28:28.697 --> 28:30.961
Okay, that's it.
You gotta get out of here.

28:31.032 --> 28:32.431
Go to
the Mainland or something.

28:32.500 --> 28:33.728
No. No, no.

28:34.169 --> 28:36.637
I'm gonna stay right here,
just like we planned.

28:36.705 --> 28:37.967
Are you crazy?

28:38.039 --> 28:39.768
No. I'm hot.

28:40.609 --> 28:43.100
No matter where I'd go,
he'd have it staked out.

28:43.178 --> 28:44.907
Your place, Gloria's.

28:44.980 --> 28:46.777
Well, you better
come in here, too,

28:46.848 --> 28:48.213
until things cool down.

28:48.283 --> 28:49.272
Dick, listen.

28:49.351 --> 28:51.581
Why don't you just
go back to Mitsue?

28:51.653 --> 28:53.280
Pretend you
really got nabbed,

28:53.355 --> 28:55.084
and you still
got all the money.

29:01.730 --> 29:02.924
I can't.

29:02.998 --> 29:04.022
Why not?

29:04.099 --> 29:06.090
I just can't, that's all!

29:08.136 --> 29:11.333
I was never cut out for that
kimono crowd, anyway.

29:14.609 --> 29:16.338
But I did love her.

29:17.512 --> 29:18.979
I really did.

29:19.047 --> 29:21.572
I think maybe you
still do, brother.

29:22.050 --> 29:23.210
Maybe.

29:24.119 --> 29:26.349
But not enough
to stick around.

29:27.656 --> 29:29.647
Oh, it's the best way
for her, too.

29:29.724 --> 29:32.659
I was starting to get
a roving eye again, you know?

29:32.727 --> 29:35.423
I didn't want to hurt her,
not like that.

29:35.497 --> 29:38.591
Besides, look,
we got $500,000 to split.

29:38.667 --> 29:40.965
That will buy us
a lot of fishing anywhere.

29:41.036 --> 29:43.061
I'm sticking right here
in the Islands.

29:43.138 --> 29:46.835
I can... I can still disappear
till this quiets down.

29:48.143 --> 29:49.974
I'll check with you
in a couple of days.

29:50.045 --> 29:51.069
Yeah.

29:51.146 --> 29:52.374
Stay away from Gloria's.

29:52.447 --> 29:53.812
Yeah.

29:55.717 --> 29:58.709
What makes you so sure
that Dick is all right?

29:59.888 --> 30:02.982
Because I think Dick knows
the man who kidnapped him.

30:03.058 --> 30:05.288
And I think you
know him, too.

30:05.694 --> 30:06.786
I don't understand.

30:06.861 --> 30:09.056
Dick had his fishing buddy
kidnap him, Mitsue.

30:09.130 --> 30:10.529
And I think
you're in on it.

30:10.598 --> 30:11.587
What?

30:11.666 --> 30:12.997
Come on, Mitsue.
I'm not a fool.

30:13.068 --> 30:14.968
Dick kidnapped himself.

30:15.737 --> 30:19.468
Look, I don't know
why you're saying that.

30:20.442 --> 30:23.036
But I do know
I don't have to listen.

30:26.314 --> 30:27.975
Mitsue.

30:28.283 --> 30:29.614
Please go.

30:33.355 --> 30:34.583
Mitsue.

30:35.490 --> 30:37.048
You really
don't have any idea

30:37.125 --> 30:39.025
what I'm talking about,
do you?

30:39.094 --> 30:41.927
I'll send you a check
for what we owe you.

30:43.431 --> 30:45.922
Mitsue, wait a minute.
Just hear me out.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.365
Just leave.

30:47.969 --> 30:51.496
I'll be interested in hearing
what Mr. Magnum has to say.

30:53.808 --> 30:56.868
Especially in light
of what I've already heard.

30:57.679 --> 30:59.169
Please, Father.

30:59.247 --> 31:02.410
Why did my son-in-law
arrange his own kidnapping?

31:02.817 --> 31:04.148
He didn't.

31:04.219 --> 31:06.084
Please continue,
Mr. Magnum.

31:09.124 --> 31:12.457
Mitsue, does the truth
frighten you that much?

31:15.830 --> 31:18.765
It's just a theory.
It has to do with taxes.

31:20.101 --> 31:21.432
Of course.

31:21.736 --> 31:24.296
He made a great deal of money
this last year.

31:24.372 --> 31:25.430
Yes.

31:26.007 --> 31:27.201
I must admit

31:27.275 --> 31:29.072
my son-in-law has exercised

31:29.144 --> 31:31.408
a considerable
amount of ingenuity

31:31.613 --> 31:35.049
in yet another demonstration
of his immoral character.

31:35.383 --> 31:38.250
Look, he's probably hiding out
till things cool off.

31:38.319 --> 31:41.482
Do either of you know a place
he might have gone?

31:41.890 --> 31:43.983
I know of no place. Mitsue?

31:45.994 --> 31:48.485
Your husband
brings disgrace to this family

31:48.563 --> 31:50.690
and you have
nothing to say?

31:52.901 --> 31:54.926
I know of no place either.

32:05.747 --> 32:07.408
I'm sorry, Mitsue.

32:08.783 --> 32:10.375
There's no need.

32:11.586 --> 32:13.247
Please go.

32:32.624 --> 32:35.252
I felt lower than someone who
beats up little puppies.

32:35.326 --> 32:36.953
<i>I know Mitsue had</i>
<i>been through hell</i>

32:37.028 --> 32:38.757
<i>trying to get her</i>
<i>family to accept Dick,</i>

32:38.830 --> 32:40.320
<i>and I'd just blown it for her.</i>

32:40.398 --> 32:41.422
<i>What was worse,</i>

32:41.499 --> 32:44.468
<i>I had an idea she was</i>
<i>in for a lot more grief.</i>

32:53.244 --> 32:54.802
If you're planning
suicide,

32:54.879 --> 32:56.870
please do it on
someone else's beach.

32:56.948 --> 32:58.074
What?

32:58.149 --> 32:59.480
You look despondent.

32:59.551 --> 33:01.041
I'm not despondent.

33:01.452 --> 33:02.749
I'm depressed.

33:02.820 --> 33:05.789
Sorry. I should have
noticed the difference.

33:06.491 --> 33:09.221
I just told Mitsue
my theory about Dick.

33:09.894 --> 33:12.692
No doubt with your
usual timing and tact.

33:13.398 --> 33:14.558
You know, Higgins,

33:14.632 --> 33:16.497
it's very easy
for you to be sarcastic.

33:16.568 --> 33:18.365
You don't care
about these people.

33:18.436 --> 33:20.233
You don't know what
they've been through.

33:20.438 --> 33:22.338
Or I put 'em through.

33:22.407 --> 33:24.898
Damn!
I just don't know what to do.

33:26.177 --> 33:28.372
Your case reminds me
of Mandalay in '48

33:28.446 --> 33:29.913
when Burma gained
its independence.

33:29.981 --> 33:31.972
Higgins, please.
I do not want

33:32.050 --> 33:33.449
another one of
your travelogues.

33:33.518 --> 33:35.042
One of our lads
was kidnapped.

33:35.119 --> 33:36.780
He was involved
with the daughter

33:36.854 --> 33:38.014
of an Oriental tea merchant.

33:38.089 --> 33:41.320
There were all sorts of political
and social ramifications.

33:41.392 --> 33:43.451
As an aide to
the former British governor,

33:43.528 --> 33:45.393
I wanted to
investigate the case.

33:45.463 --> 33:47.658
But it was out of
our jurisdiction.

33:47.732 --> 33:49.165
My hands were tied.

33:49.233 --> 33:50.632
The incompetent
local authorities

33:50.702 --> 33:52.499
finally found the lad,

33:52.570 --> 33:54.800
decomposed
beyond recognition.

33:55.506 --> 33:56.666
That's awful.

33:56.741 --> 33:57.901
Yes.

33:58.242 --> 34:00.574
He was the finest
cricketer in the regiment.

34:01.079 --> 34:04.242
Higgins, you trying
to tell me something?

34:04.315 --> 34:05.942
Good heavens, no.

34:06.618 --> 34:07.607
Of course,

34:07.719 --> 34:10.654
you do have jurisdiction,
even though somewhat limited.

34:10.989 --> 34:13.685
You can do something
to see justice is done.

34:13.757 --> 34:16.158
You also don't have to
let the local authorities

34:16.226 --> 34:17.455
muck it up.

34:21.065 --> 34:22.793
Thank you, Higgins.

34:23.301 --> 34:24.563
What for?

34:25.268 --> 34:27.168
I was just reminiscing.

35:08.780 --> 35:09.940
Hello.

35:12.316 --> 35:13.806
Anybody there?

35:16.320 --> 35:18.618
No. I ain't
taking her out.

35:18.690 --> 35:20.021
One of the engines
is down

35:20.091 --> 35:22.389
and it's gonna take me the
day to get her runnin'.

35:22.460 --> 35:23.552
Try the <i>Nalani.</i>

35:23.628 --> 35:26.324
No, wait a minute.
Are you the captain?

35:27.532 --> 35:28.692
Hello?

35:29.233 --> 35:31.201
Well,
what do you think?

35:31.469 --> 35:32.458
Oh.

35:34.739 --> 35:36.764
I hear you take
Dick McWilliams out a lot.

35:36.841 --> 35:38.331
Yeah, he's a regular.

35:38.409 --> 35:40.400
And his pal.
A big Hawaiian.

35:40.511 --> 35:41.773
Why are you so interested?

35:41.846 --> 35:44.007
Well, I hear they can
spend days doing nothing

35:44.082 --> 35:45.947
but baiting hooks and
slugging down beers.

35:46.017 --> 35:47.245
They stay here
on the boat?

35:47.318 --> 35:49.343
On this boat?
Are you kiddin'?

35:49.454 --> 35:50.512
Would you?

35:50.588 --> 35:52.317
No. Where do
they stay?

35:53.991 --> 35:56.186
Always something
going wrong.

35:56.527 --> 35:58.392
Today it's that
damn engine.

35:58.463 --> 36:00.055
Tomorrow,
who knows?

36:00.264 --> 36:01.492
Could be
the valves.

36:01.566 --> 36:02.658
Uh-huh.

36:02.734 --> 36:05.464
Of course the generator's
been acting up lately.

36:05.536 --> 36:06.560
Boy,

36:06.637 --> 36:09.231
I'll bet you could always use
a little extra cash, huh?

36:09.307 --> 36:11.172
Yeah,
I guess I could.

36:16.380 --> 36:17.404
Tsk.

36:17.482 --> 36:20.918
Yeah, I used to
take Dick and Kaholo

36:21.352 --> 36:23.411
up to
the Koolau Islands.

36:23.688 --> 36:24.814
It's good fishin' there.

36:24.889 --> 36:26.288
Any particular place?

36:26.357 --> 36:29.155
I just told you.
The Koolau Islands.

36:29.227 --> 36:32.025
Yeah, I know, but do you have
any idea how many there are?

36:32.096 --> 36:33.154
13?

36:33.231 --> 36:36.291
Do you expect me to hop over
all 13 of these islands?

36:36.367 --> 36:38.426
That's the name
of your service, isn't it?

36:38.503 --> 36:39.561
Island Hoppers?

36:39.637 --> 36:42.606
Yeah, I'm thinking about changing
it to Magnum's Taxi Service.

36:43.608 --> 36:45.269
Look, we'll start
with the big ones.

36:45.343 --> 36:47.004
Head that way, T.C.

36:47.245 --> 36:48.735
"Head that way, T.C.

36:48.813 --> 36:51.247
Stop here, T.C.
Drop me there, T.C."

36:51.315 --> 36:52.680
Enough, T.C.

37:31.055 --> 37:32.522
You know,
I feel like an elevator,

37:32.590 --> 37:34.751
going up, going down,

37:34.826 --> 37:37.021
and going up
and going down.

37:37.094 --> 37:39.585
Wait a minute.
I got another shack.

37:40.031 --> 37:41.931
Yeah,
that's number 24.

37:43.401 --> 37:45.301
Just set it down, okay?

38:15.466 --> 38:17.627
Next week
I can write a book:

38:18.102 --> 38:21.196
<i>Tourist Guide to Every</i>
<i>Deserted Shack in Hawaii.</i>

38:22.073 --> 38:23.506
All the flying
I did today,

38:23.574 --> 38:25.064
if I wasn't
already certified,

38:25.142 --> 38:26.404
I could qualify now.

38:29.180 --> 38:30.340
Hello?

38:41.592 --> 38:43.059
Anybody here?

39:04.982 --> 39:08.559
<i>T.C. wasn't exactly happy about
todays wild goose chase.</i>

39:08.586 --> 39:10.986
<i>But we finally found</i>
<i>what we were looking for,</i>

39:11.088 --> 39:12.521
<i>unfortunately.</i>

39:12.590 --> 39:15.024
<i>It was a lousy end</i>
<i>to a lousy day.</i>

39:18.578 --> 39:20.569
<i>My little voice</i>
<i>finally started talking.</i>

39:20.647 --> 39:23.241
<i>It said I should have called</i>
<i>the cops in the first place.</i>

39:23.316 --> 39:25.682
<i>That's often the best thing</i>
<i>about my little voice.</i>

39:25.752 --> 39:27.117
<i>20/20 hindsight.</i>

39:27.187 --> 39:28.449
You're blaming
yourself.

39:28.521 --> 39:29.510
No, I'm not.

39:29.589 --> 39:30.988
Yes, you are.
You got that

39:31.057 --> 39:32.684
"I should have done
it different" look

39:32.759 --> 39:33.783
all over your face.

39:33.860 --> 39:34.918
Well, I should have.

39:34.995 --> 39:38.362
Telling Mitsue and her father that
Dick kidnapped himself was dumb.

39:38.431 --> 39:40.092
I don't think
it was dumb.

39:40.166 --> 39:42.896
Hey, we all knew Dick was
somewhat of a good-timer.

39:42.969 --> 39:44.493
Yeah, I suppose.

39:44.571 --> 39:46.630
You know, I think
it still was his scam.

39:46.706 --> 39:49.106
I guess somebody just got
a little bit too greedy.

39:49.175 --> 39:51.234
Maybe like his buddy Kaholo?

39:51.311 --> 39:52.471
Maybe.

40:29.849 --> 40:30.873
Island Hoppers.

40:33.119 --> 40:34.586
It's for you.

40:34.654 --> 40:35.712
Hello.

40:35.789 --> 40:37.780
<i>Your man Kaholo</i>
<i>showed up.</i>

40:37.857 --> 40:38.949
Is he still there?

40:39.025 --> 40:40.185
Yeah.
He's still there.

40:40.260 --> 40:42.023
But my guess is he
won't be here for long.

40:42.095 --> 40:43.153
And Thomas,
you were right.

40:43.229 --> 40:44.253
He snuck in
the back way.

40:44.331 --> 40:45.355
I'm on my way.

40:45.432 --> 40:47.900
And, Rick, if he tries
to leave, you stop him.

40:50.704 --> 40:53.434
Sure. I'll just put him
in an arm-lock.

40:54.007 --> 40:55.599
Gee, is he nuts.

41:04.084 --> 41:05.813
What are we
gonna name it?

41:05.885 --> 41:06.943
Name what?

41:07.020 --> 41:08.317
Our orchid farm.

41:09.789 --> 41:12.155
Oh. I don't care.
Name it anything you want.

41:12.225 --> 41:14.125
Can we call it
"Gloria's Farm"?

41:14.194 --> 41:15.354
I've never seen my name

41:15.428 --> 41:17.225
up in lights
like that before.

41:17.530 --> 41:18.497
Fine.

41:18.565 --> 41:19.532
That's okay
with you?

41:19.599 --> 41:20.964
Fine.
Yeah, that's fine, Gloria.

41:21.034 --> 41:22.126
Listen, could you
hurry up?

41:22.202 --> 41:23.931
We gotta
get out of here.

41:26.639 --> 41:27.901
Who is it?

41:27.974 --> 41:29.669
Magnum. I want to talk to you.

41:29.743 --> 41:31.768
I don't feel like
talking.

41:33.813 --> 41:35.212
Go, Kaholo!

41:44.624 --> 41:45.784
Stand up.

41:45.859 --> 41:48.453
The cut wasn't big enough for you,
you had to kill him.

41:48.528 --> 41:49.460
What?

41:49.529 --> 41:51.520
We've been to the island.
We found Dick's body.

41:51.598 --> 41:52.565
I didn't do it.

41:52.632 --> 41:53.997
We set up
the nab together,

41:54.067 --> 41:55.762
but I didn't kill him.
I swear I didn't.

41:55.835 --> 41:57.063
I didn't even
know he was dead.

41:57.137 --> 41:58.798
Then why did you take
the lover's exit?

41:58.872 --> 42:01.204
'Cause Gloria told me
you were looking for me.

42:01.274 --> 42:03.003
I even told Dick.
I went to the...

42:03.076 --> 42:04.737
I went to
the shack to warn him.

42:04.811 --> 42:06.540
He's good.
He covered all his ground.

42:06.613 --> 42:09.844
It's the truth.
When I left him, he was fine.

42:10.617 --> 42:14.212
It's... it's my share.
$100,000. Go ahead, count it.

42:16.523 --> 42:18.821
Who else knew
about the island?

42:19.492 --> 42:21.517
I didn't think
anybody did.

42:27.867 --> 42:30.802
<i>He was still singing</i>
<i>the same innocent song.</i>

42:31.104 --> 42:32.662
<i>I sort of believed him,</i>

42:32.739 --> 42:34.673
<i>though I really</i>
<i>didn't want to.</i>

42:34.808 --> 42:37.174
<i>The alternative</i>
<i>was really ugly.</i>

43:49.349 --> 43:50.577
Mitsue.

44:09.636 --> 44:10.830
Mitsue.

44:12.872 --> 44:14.066
Mitsue.

44:18.278 --> 44:19.336
Where's Mitsue?

44:19.412 --> 44:22.472
Our problems no longer
concern you, Mr. Magnum.

44:23.149 --> 44:25.379
You know he's dead,
don't you?

44:25.718 --> 44:28.243
I found him.
No knife, no gun.

44:28.321 --> 44:29.879
Beaten to death.

44:29.956 --> 44:32.550
You're a fisherman.
You know where he'd go.

44:33.760 --> 44:36.194
I had no intention
of killing him.

44:36.529 --> 44:37.723
I went to talk,

44:37.797 --> 44:40.129
to make him return
to the police.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.130
But as usual,
he would not listen to me.

44:43.536 --> 44:45.868
Instead, he chose
to provoke me.

44:46.372 --> 44:48.499
I responded
accordingly.

44:48.675 --> 44:51.508
Did you really have to,
or did you want to?

44:51.778 --> 44:53.405
Where is Mitsue?

44:53.479 --> 44:56.004
You are Occidental.
You do not understand.

44:56.082 --> 44:57.572
Where is she?

44:58.017 --> 45:00.451
He brought disgrace
to the family.

45:00.687 --> 45:03.315
My daughter is doing
the only honorable thing.

45:06.559 --> 45:07.787
Seppuku?

45:09.262 --> 45:11.730
You're willing to let
your daughter kill herself?

45:11.798 --> 45:14.528
She insisted.
I respect her wishes.

45:15.034 --> 45:16.524
Out of my way.

45:41.527 --> 45:42.892
Mitsue!

45:43.463 --> 45:44.953
Mitsue, don't.

45:48.768 --> 45:50.998
He was never
coming back to me.

45:52.605 --> 45:53.765
Mitsue.

45:56.509 --> 45:58.033
All the time

46:00.513 --> 46:02.378
I thought he loved me.

46:07.654 --> 46:09.178
I believed him.

46:20.900 --> 46:22.993
Dick was
two different men.

46:23.936 --> 46:26.029
One who was always looking
for a good time,

46:26.105 --> 46:27.936
no matter who it hurt,

46:29.008 --> 46:31.636
but the other was
a man who loved you,

46:36.282 --> 46:37.613
very much.

46:39.552 --> 46:41.213
So much so that

46:42.288 --> 46:44.620
I think he knew that
he'd ruin your life

46:44.691 --> 46:46.158
if he stayed.

46:51.898 --> 46:54.924
Remember the good
parts of him, Mitsue.

46:56.436 --> 46:59.269
There's enough people
that remember the rest.

47:05.845 --> 47:07.676
Thomas, can you get me
some oregano?

47:07.747 --> 47:09.009
Oh, sure.

47:12.719 --> 47:13.651
Say, Rick,

47:13.720 --> 47:15.551
who was the other one
on the list?

47:16.122 --> 47:17.111
What list?

47:17.190 --> 47:19.522
Oh, the list of
drivers that we IDed.

47:19.759 --> 47:21.420
Hmm.
What do you think?

47:22.829 --> 47:23.853
More salt.

47:23.930 --> 47:24.862
Right.

47:27.100 --> 47:28.897
So,
who was it, Rick?

47:30.670 --> 47:32.399
You think
it needs more wine?

47:32.705 --> 47:34.730
Rick, come on.
Who was it?

47:35.775 --> 47:37.106
Catherine.

47:37.744 --> 47:39.234
Catherine who?

47:39.512 --> 47:41.707
T.C., what about the peppers?

47:41.948 --> 47:42.937
Rick.

47:44.584 --> 47:47.382
I don't know.
They don't have a last name.

47:47.453 --> 47:49.580
Who doesn't have
a last name?

47:56.329 --> 47:57.421
Nuns.

48:01.434 --> 48:03.129
Well, what's so funny?

48:03.202 --> 48:06.228
You mean to tell me
a nun gave you that shiner?

48:06.305 --> 48:08.466
She thought I was
trying to steal her car.

48:12.912 --> 48:14.812
Hey, she was a big nun.
