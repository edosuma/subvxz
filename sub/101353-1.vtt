01:03.531 --> 01:04.763
Come on, Jamie.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.265
It'll be fun.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.266
I've seen two people jump.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.200
Last chance.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.501
Tomorrow I'm gone.

01:09.503 --> 01:10.436
No way.

01:10.438 --> 01:11.303
I'm not jumping.

01:25.152 --> 01:25.818
Whoo!

01:38.632 --> 01:39.531
Come on, Jamie.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.732
You've got to do it.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.234
It's the best
feeling in the world.

01:42.236 --> 01:46.238
Maybe for you, but
I have to go, Lea.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.240
I guess that's it.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.709
JAMIE: You'll come
to visit, right?

01:50.711 --> 01:52.277
See ya.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.178
Bye.

04:34.375 --> 04:42.581
[dogs barking]

04:42.583 --> 04:43.548
Who's there?

04:43.550 --> 04:49.821
[barking continues]

05:14.782 --> 05:17.382
Keep you safe.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.818
You know, I don't like them.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.386
There's only meanness out there.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.393
Mom?

05:36.870 --> 05:37.769
Dad?

05:51.385 --> 05:54.119
Sam?

05:54.121 --> 05:56.388
Do you know where
my parents are?

05:56.390 --> 05:59.524
They have a
farewell on campus.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.561
They asked me to see if you
wanted to have a bite to eat.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.130
Yeah.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.099
I haven't got
anything in the fridge.

06:07.101 --> 06:08.533
We'll have to go down to Pete's.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.434
OK.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.139
OK, [inaudible].

06:47.141 --> 06:48.740
I want to stay with Bill.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.708
No, you're coming.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.111
Go.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.079
Let's go.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.631
Pick a card.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.005
What happened?

07:24.745 --> 07:27.145
My dad cut me with
a piece of glass.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.781
By accident?

07:29.783 --> 07:30.949
Here.
Don't show me.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.817
Put it back.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.029
Where is it?

07:44.031 --> 07:44.896
How'd you do that?

07:53.106 --> 07:54.005
I gotta go.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.741
Sorry.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.844
What's your name?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.245
Bill, what's yours?

08:00.247 --> 08:02.147
Lea.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.615
Dad.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.684
[inaudible]

08:18.532 --> 08:19.531
WOMAN: Let's go.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.499
Get in the car.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.539
Need help?

08:27.541 --> 08:28.240
No, I'm good.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.879
Who is he?

08:33.881 --> 08:37.215
Saw him in the woods talking
crazy stuff to his dogs.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.651
You just stay away from him.

08:39.653 --> 08:40.519
He's not right in the head.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.661
Jumped off a cliff today.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.996
Hmm.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.297
Took me two whole
summers to finally do it.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.532
Felt good?

08:53.534 --> 08:54.232
Felt amazing.

09:01.775 --> 09:02.807
I want to stay here.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.042
Why do we have to move?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.810
You're gonna be OK.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.812
I just wish we could have at
least stayed for the summer.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.215
But no, sending me off
to summer camp out there.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.185

09:14.187 --> 09:15.754

Ginger.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.931
Lea.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.132
Have to go now.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.678
We're expecting monthly
written reports of your life

09:39.680 --> 09:42.180
down there.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.983
Bye, Sam.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.217
You take care of yourself now.

09:48.855 --> 09:49.721
Bye, Ginger.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.030
LEON: I don't think that's fair.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.999
I don't think any
of this is fair.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.734
Please, Leon, not now.

10:02.736 --> 10:07.138
Let's just get through this
last day without losing it.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.674
I'm taking those records.

10:09.676 --> 10:12.010
No, half of these are mine.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.312
[inaudible]

10:14.314 --> 10:16.348
You really want to make
you pay for all of it?

10:16.350 --> 10:17.782
I'm taking the records.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.189
You clearly know how to
take advantage of a situation,

10:24.191 --> 10:25.290
so take them.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.895
Hi, honey.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.064
[inaudible], ma puce.

10:33.066 --> 10:33.999
Dad, stop calling me that.

10:34.001 --> 10:34.899
It's embarrassing.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.167
I'm not five anymore.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.869
We brought you some
food from the party.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.138
I'm not hungry.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.873
Have you packed
an overnight bag?

10:41.875 --> 10:43.675
I don't want to go and
live in stupid Houston.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.246
You want to take a night swim?

10:48.248 --> 10:49.114
No.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.185
[crying]

11:15.175 --> 11:16.941
Bonjour, sleepyhead.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.109
I didn't sleep.

11:18.111 --> 11:22.080
The movers will
be here any minute.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.682
Sam stopped by.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.382
He left you a present.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.392
I overheard you and
Mom talk yesterday.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.762
LEON: It's complicated, Lea.

11:37.764 --> 11:38.463
Are you getting a divorce?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.368
No.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.271
No, we want to work things out.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.441
I want to work things out.

11:49.443 --> 11:51.042
Is that why we're moving?

11:56.917 --> 12:01.152
Have you packed
all your knickknacks?

12:01.154 --> 12:02.353
I gotta go, Dad.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.722
I forgot something
really important.

12:03.724 --> 12:04.456
Put it in my suitcase.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.423
I'll be right back.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.992
Lea!

12:07.994 --> 12:09.260
No trailing off today.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.506
What do you want?

12:54.508 --> 12:57.408
I want to talk to Bill.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.277
Never thought he'd have
a scrawny little girlfriend

12:59.279 --> 13:00.845
like you.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.147
I'm not his girlfriend.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.948
What do you want from him?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.121
He took something from me.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.955
Well, scrawny, he isn't here.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.430
OK then.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.323

14:50.557 --> 14:51.923
You were looking for me?

14:51.925 --> 14:52.991
Where's my ladder?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.192
What ladder?

14:54.194 --> 14:55.426
I know it was you.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.262
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.162
Where is it?

15:01.067 --> 15:03.334
You're lying.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.302
You want to hit me, go ahead.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.677
Get off me.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.611
Get off!

15:17.584 --> 15:19.284
- Give that to me.
- I need my things.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.185
Where are you hiding the ladder?
- I'm not joking.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.053
Me neither.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
Bill?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.568
Bill!

15:37.570 --> 15:41.673
Bill, please say something.

15:41.675 --> 15:42.640
Bill, I'll be right back.

15:42.642 --> 15:43.541
I'm gonna go get a rope.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.181
Sam?

15:50.183 --> 15:51.082
Sam!

16:06.967 --> 16:08.333
Bill?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.334
Bill.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.035
Bill, say something.

16:15.008 --> 16:15.673
Bill!

16:24.284 --> 16:25.283
Help!

16:25.285 --> 16:26.150
Help!

16:28.655 --> 16:31.255
Help!

16:31.257 --> 16:34.225
Please.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.193
Is someone there?

16:39.599 --> 16:42.567
Help, somebody!

16:45.572 --> 16:48.573
Please!

16:48.575 --> 16:49.540
[screams]

16:49.542 --> 16:50.541
You're trespassing.

16:50.543 --> 16:51.509
Leave now.

[bangs on door]

17:05.358 --> 17:06.791
I need your help.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.526
Bill fell down a deep
shaft, and he can't get out.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.694
Uh, who are you?

17:09.696 --> 17:11.796
Where's my fucking gun, Molly?

17:11.798 --> 17:12.730
Please come.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.766
He's hurt.

17:14.768 --> 17:15.700
Just go.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.370

17:26.446 --> 17:27.712
Lea!

17:27.714 --> 17:30.448
She overheard us last night.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.749
Oh, no.

17:31.751 --> 17:32.650
Do you think she's hiding?

17:36.089 --> 17:37.321
Why couldn't you
keep your mouth shut?

17:37.323 --> 17:38.456
[phone rings]

17:38.458 --> 17:41.325
Nora, don't jump
to conclusions.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.061
I haven't told her anything.

17:43.063 --> 17:47.265
She asked me if we
were splitting up.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.133
Really, Nora?

17:49.135 --> 17:50.268
Him?

17:50.270 --> 17:52.303
Now?

17:52.305 --> 17:54.772
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.140
What does that change, huh?

17:56.142 --> 17:56.841
Who cares?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.576
You, obviously.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.710
Shit!

17:59.712 --> 18:02.213
I really didn't want
her to find out.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.581
Not like this.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.249
I told her we were
trying to work things out.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.617
Your version.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.153
What's that supposed to mean?

18:09.155 --> 18:11.222
When will you ever be
able to face the facts?

18:11.224 --> 18:13.558
I don't want to be
married to you anymore.

18:18.098 --> 18:18.796

Oh, shit.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.371
You're still here?

22:20.373 --> 22:22.039
I sent out the final
notice two weeks ago.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.741
I know.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.743
It was also put on your door.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.378
Can I get another
month or two?

22:27.380 --> 22:28.546
I just-- I can't
leave right now.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.715
I'm selling the
building next week.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.616
You've known this since
a couple of months.

22:32.618 --> 22:34.852
I have an inspection
in two days.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.986
I can't deal with
this right now.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.421
I'm already late for work.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.123
I'll drop off the
moving boxes today.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.825
If you're not out
by the weekend,

22:40.827 --> 22:42.760
I have to put a
padlock on this door.

Hello, Ron?

23:58.471 --> 23:59.503
Hello, Leon.

23:59.505 --> 24:00.204
Did I catch you at a bad time?

24:00.206 --> 24:01.105
No, no.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.740
Not at all.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.975
I just wanted to thank
you for sending me the book.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.744
Oh, good.
You got it.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.145
Yeah, I look
forward to reading it.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.148
I'm impressed by the fact
that Lea translated it.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.183
[laughs]

24:12.185 --> 24:13.651
How is my daughter?

24:13.653 --> 24:16.187
She just canceled our
dinner plans again.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.788
I'm concerned, Leon.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.722
I mean, she's a lovely girl.

24:18.724 --> 24:19.623
Don't get me wrong.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.658
She's very smart, too.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.793
She's been a real asset here.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.729
Lately, though, she's
been distracted,

24:25.731 --> 24:28.232
and seems to have
lost all enthusiasm.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.801
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.603
Thanks for telling me.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.805
Have you talked to her about it?

24:34.807 --> 24:37.007
No, not yet.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.809
I'm just not sure
where to go from here.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.244
I don't have any
more translations,

24:40.246 --> 24:42.213
and she's been late with
a couple of revisions.

24:42.215 --> 24:44.815
Today, she hasn't even shown up.

24:44.817 --> 24:48.052
That surprises me.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.020
Listen, Ron, I'll
check on her, OK?

24:50.022 --> 24:50.921
Thanks for calling.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.101
Lea.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.670
Lea.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.005
What are you doing out here?

25:12.578 --> 25:16.213
You ever notice how
ugly the building is?

25:16.215 --> 25:18.983
I've been texting
and calling you.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.685
I misplaced my phone.

25:21.687 --> 25:24.922
Ron needs the corrections
on the Lang novel.

25:24.924 --> 25:25.956
Did you get them done?

25:25.958 --> 25:26.857
Almost.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.295
Go see a doctor.

25:31.297 --> 25:32.296
You look awful.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.138
Why don't you go
back to therapy?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.606
I've had enough therapy.

25:42.608 --> 25:44.308
I just-- I don't think
the prescriptions

25:44.310 --> 25:46.277
are effective anymore.

25:46.279 --> 25:49.980
Because you've
been on it too long.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.649
Do you eat regularly?

25:51.651 --> 25:52.716
Drink enough water?

25:52.718 --> 25:54.184
Exercise?

25:54.186 --> 25:55.052
All this will help.

26:01.627 --> 26:02.326
OK.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.031
Continue with them, then.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.640
What about friends?

26:16.642 --> 26:20.010
Do you have any good friends
that you can talk to?

26:20.012 --> 26:21.078
I don't like to burden them.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.185
BILL: Pick a card.

27:36.288 --> 27:40.090
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

27:40.092 --> 27:43.427
A worrier, or a warrior?

27:49.068 --> 27:52.403
I think you are
a little fighter.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.240
Ah!

29:03.242 --> 29:07.778
[gasping]

29:09.815 --> 29:11.815
Where is the line?

29:11.817 --> 29:14.785
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:14.787 --> 29:16.754
[splash]

29:21.193 --> 29:23.761
[birds chirping]

29:23.763 --> 29:25.162
Where am I?

29:25.164 --> 29:26.163
LEA: Bill.

29:26.165 --> 29:29.767
Bill, say something.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.101
[inaudible]

29:38.511 --> 29:42.479
[electronic beeps]

30:03.836 --> 30:05.536
Close call.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.371
LEA: How long have I been here?

30:07.373 --> 30:10.841
You came in yesterday.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.176
Where's my stuff?

30:12.178 --> 30:14.845
You had nothing on you.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.848
I need to check your info before
the doctor discharges you.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.516
Can I borrow a phone?

30:19.518 --> 30:22.152
I need to make a quick call.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.487
OK.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.822
I'll come back in
a sec to get it.

30:24.824 --> 30:25.489
Thanks.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.497
I went to one of them
at Union Square Park.

30:33.499 --> 30:37.100
I didn't realize that--

30:37.102 --> 30:40.170
hey, I know that guy.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.071
I'll meet you out front.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.510
Professor [inaudible]?

30:46.512 --> 30:47.511
Danny.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.445
Hey.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.615
What a nice surprise.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.383
I hope you haven't
given up on philosophy.

30:53.385 --> 30:54.284
Oh, no.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.352
No, not at all.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.087
I've been studying your book.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.292
I carry this with
me wherever I go.

31:02.294 --> 31:03.460
Danny, we gotta go.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.115
There you are.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.055
You look pale, ma puce.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.124
Don't call me that, Dad.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.292
Thanks for the clothes.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.266
What did the doctor say?

31:42.268 --> 31:44.201
They wouldn't tell me anything.

31:44.203 --> 31:45.969
What happened?

31:45.971 --> 31:49.373
I just collapsed
in a swimming pool.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.474
Why?

31:50.476 --> 31:51.475
I don't know.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.309
It's never happened before.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.381
Are you taking
your medication?

31:57.383 --> 31:58.682
Sometimes.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.250
I have to turn these forms in.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.118
I'll meet you outside.

32:04.523 --> 32:07.291
So, you know, Maureen, she
hasn't been to the city before.

32:07.293 --> 32:11.662
I took her to [inaudible] Hill,
always a new restaurant there.

32:11.664 --> 32:12.663
[cup set on table]

32:12.665 --> 32:14.631
Merci.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.934
So, what do you think?

32:16.936 --> 32:17.701
About what?

32:17.703 --> 32:20.237
Coming upstate with me.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.638
No.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.173
You haven't been listening
to anything I said.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.042
You have a reading
at your old college.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.576
I know.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.045
I think getting out of here
for a day would do you good.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.080
Dad, please, I can't.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.114
Why?

32:31.116 --> 32:35.152
Because, I'm behind with work.

32:35.154 --> 32:36.286
I need to catch up.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.323
And I have to find
a new apartment.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.724
Lea.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.493
Do you still like your work?

32:43.495 --> 32:44.394
It's easy.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.329
Why?

32:45.331 --> 32:47.331
Because Ron called me.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.499
He called you?

32:49.501 --> 32:51.702
He received my book.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.438
He thinks you've lost
interest in your job.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.305
Have you?

33:12.091 --> 33:16.393
[birds chirping]

33:18.263 --> 33:19.196
No.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.130
Don't know.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.231
I'm waiting.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.132
Hold on a minute.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.071
OK.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.106
Huh?

33:29.108 --> 33:31.208
I'll come.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.776
Good!
[laughs]

33:32.778 --> 33:33.710
I'm so glad.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.070
LEON: Here we are.

34:00.072 --> 34:03.340
Not much has changed.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.642
There's the bakery.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.577
Ah.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.047
There's the dentist.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.148
You remember Jamie's mom?

34:11.150 --> 34:12.049
She was your dentist.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.521
Are you still in touch with
your old friend, Jamie?

34:33.138 --> 34:33.804
Voila.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.547
You remember our old house?

34:43.549 --> 34:45.515
I do, but I don't
want to go back in time.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.855
I wanted to bring you
back here for so long.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.156
We had good times here.

34:59.164 --> 34:59.896
You were happy.

34:59.897 --> 35:00.629
You were real free and happy.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.636
You were so happy that
you didn't want to leave.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.737
You ran away on moving day.

35:07.739 --> 35:08.638
You remember?

35:12.411 --> 35:16.179
I still feel really
bad about that.

35:16.181 --> 35:17.481
We should have told
you we were moving

35:17.483 --> 35:19.149
to separate places in Houston.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.795
You got really sick.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.298
Worrisome sick.

35:35.300 --> 35:39.369
We didn't expect you to be
that upset over our separation.

35:39.371 --> 35:40.737
It was a pretty hasty move.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.806
I remember that.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.774
LEON: Unfortunate circumstances.

35:44.776 --> 35:50.147
Let's just get through this
last day without losing it.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.915
You both were always
so secretive about what

35:51.917 --> 35:53.717
really happened here
between the two of you.

36:00.492 --> 36:04.594
Your mother had an
affair, and he happened

36:04.596 --> 36:06.163
to be another professor.

36:11.270 --> 36:14.838
You know, it's a
small town, puce.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.544
The talk.

36:20.545 --> 36:22.412
I just couldn't take it anymore.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.313
Now it's all in the past.

36:29.488 --> 36:30.353
Hey, Dad?

36:34.293 --> 36:37.260
Why did you say I
was running away?

36:37.262 --> 36:37.961
Where was I?

36:40.699 --> 36:41.598
Ce pas.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.832
I couldn't find you.

36:42.834 --> 36:45.669
Sam couldn't either.

36:45.671 --> 36:48.772
Well, what happened exactly?

36:48.774 --> 36:50.440
Who is that?

36:50.442 --> 36:51.441
I already told you.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.776
Maureen.

36:52.778 --> 36:55.579
I've mentioned her to
you a couple of times.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.881
But what is she
doing here now?

36:57.883 --> 37:01.284
You told me that you didn't
want to go to the reading,

37:01.286 --> 37:03.286
so I asked her to meet us here.

37:03.288 --> 37:05.956
I could have taken the train.

37:05.958 --> 37:10.527
I thought you might want to
explore a bit, on your own.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.362
It's so gorgeous up here.

37:17.402 --> 37:20.737
Maureen, Lea.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.406
It's so nice to meet you.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.675
So, this is where you grew up?

37:25.677 --> 37:28.945
She was a wild child.

37:28.947 --> 37:33.850
[inaudible] This
will prove it to you.

37:33.852 --> 37:38.888
I finally cleaned out the
attic, and I found it.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.725
It was never my
intention to hurt you.

37:45.864 --> 37:46.430
I love you, ma puce.

37:46.431 --> 37:46.997
I hope to see you again soon.

37:49.568 --> 37:50.467
Call me.

38:02.848 --> 38:03.847
[brakes screech]

38:03.849 --> 38:04.981
Watch out!

38:04.983 --> 38:06.850
You almost hit me!

38:06.852 --> 38:08.952
Sorry.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.587
Keep your eyes
on the road, lady.

38:22.701 --> 38:26.736
WOMAN: But I say unto
you, love your enemies.

38:26.738 --> 38:29.339
Bless them that curse you.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.308
Do good to them that hate you.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.743
And pray for them
which despitefully

38:33.745 --> 38:36.946
use you, and persecute you.

38:36.948 --> 38:40.750
That you may be the children of
your father which is in heaven.

38:40.752 --> 38:45.555
For he maketh his sun to rise
on the evil and on the good.

38:45.557 --> 38:50.593
And sendeth rain on the
just, and on the unjust.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.395
Thank you, Mom.

38:52.397 --> 38:53.863
That was beautifully read.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.765
Thanks.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.068
Today, I'd like us to
talk about this last passage

38:58.070 --> 39:00.003
in what I just read.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.771
Uh, who are you?

39:01.773 --> 39:05.375
For he maketh his sun to rise
on the evil and on the good.

39:05.377 --> 39:09.913
And sendeth rain on the
just, and on the unjust.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.047
It's a beautiful passage.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.972
Penny for your thoughts.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.575
I dreamt of a whale,
swimming out there.

39:43.682 --> 39:44.948
I found this for you.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.416
Thought you could
shape it into a turtle.

39:51.456 --> 39:52.922
Yeah, that could work.

39:52.924 --> 39:53.823
Thanks.

40:27.426 --> 40:28.091
Sam?

40:36.034 --> 40:38.601
Sam?

40:38.603 --> 40:44.941
[footsteps]

40:58.490 --> 41:00.557
It's me.

41:00.559 --> 41:01.224
Lea.

41:06.064 --> 41:06.930
What happened to you?

41:14.639 --> 41:15.538
Come in.

41:34.526 --> 41:37.727
I saw our old
house is for sale.

41:37.729 --> 41:38.628
Couple from Montreal.

41:42.734 --> 41:46.736
They came for the summer,
but they don't come no more.

41:52.811 --> 41:54.110
I take care of it for them.

42:08.894 --> 42:09.792
Tea?

42:12.264 --> 42:13.162
Sure.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.644
How are you?

42:27.646 --> 42:29.012
How have you been?

42:29.014 --> 42:29.913
I'm here.

42:33.652 --> 42:35.818
I've always been here.

42:35.820 --> 42:37.954
Sorry for not
getting in touch.

42:43.194 --> 42:44.093
Why are you here?

42:46.831 --> 42:48.598
I came with my dad.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.033
But he's gone.

42:50.035 --> 42:53.236
He's doing a reading of his
book at his old college.

42:53.238 --> 42:54.304
And you didn't go with him.

42:54.306 --> 42:55.171
No.

42:58.176 --> 42:59.108
It's hot in here.

43:13.291 --> 43:14.691
Are you sick?

43:14.693 --> 43:18.161
No, it's just for emergencies.

43:22.367 --> 43:23.783
Why did you come, Lea?

43:23.784 --> 43:25.200
Dad give me this photo album.

43:25.203 --> 43:28.671
There's a picture of you and me.

43:28.673 --> 43:29.706
Where is it?

43:29.708 --> 43:31.641
Where is it?

43:31.643 --> 43:33.610
Here.

43:33.612 --> 43:34.611
Here it is.

43:38.249 --> 43:39.182
Yeah.

43:39.183 --> 43:40.116
Dad talked about happy times.

43:42.887 --> 43:43.786
You don't remember?

43:49.394 --> 43:51.628
I wanted to show you that.

43:51.630 --> 43:54.297
You came to show
me that photo?

43:54.299 --> 43:56.366
Yeah.

43:56.368 --> 44:00.670
And I wanted to see you, but
now I think I gotta get going.

44:00.672 --> 44:01.804
Where are you going now?

44:01.806 --> 44:02.972
Going back.

44:02.974 --> 44:03.906
Back.

44:03.908 --> 44:05.708
Where's back?

44:05.710 --> 44:07.310
Back to the city.

44:07.312 --> 44:09.245
Well, you're not going to make
it back to the city like this.

44:09.247 --> 44:11.848
You're not going to
make it back to the--

44:11.850 --> 44:13.149
Lea.
- I don't want to stay here.

44:13.151 --> 44:14.050
SAM: You're a mess.

44:14.052 --> 44:16.152
I can't talk anymore.

44:16.154 --> 44:17.053
What's happened to you?

44:24.729 --> 44:25.395
Fuck.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.003
LEA: Help!

44:34.005 --> 44:35.071
Is someone there?

44:35.073 --> 44:35.938
Please!

44:50.321 --> 44:51.921
Here.

44:51.923 --> 44:53.289
Drink this.

44:53.291 --> 44:55.291
What is it?

44:55.293 --> 44:56.793
It'll get the chemicals
out of your body.

45:01.466 --> 45:02.999
What time is it?

45:03.001 --> 45:04.167
It's a little after 6:00.

45:04.169 --> 45:06.269
The sun's just coming up.

45:06.271 --> 45:07.136
I can't sleep.

45:19.050 --> 45:22.151
Are you still carving things?

45:22.153 --> 45:23.753
No.

45:23.755 --> 45:25.488
I gave that up years ago.

45:38.002 --> 45:42.839
I remember you gave me
a whale the day we left.

45:48.446 --> 45:52.448
I hated saying
goodbye to Ginger.

45:52.450 --> 45:55.451
I had this hunting stand.

45:55.453 --> 45:58.054
For me.

45:58.056 --> 46:00.323
There was a hunting
stand, and I made it mine.

46:05.230 --> 46:08.164
Did you know that?

46:08.166 --> 46:11.067
Of course.

46:11.069 --> 46:13.970
I remember.

46:13.972 --> 46:15.271
LEA: Is it still there?

46:18.543 --> 46:21.844
You want to go see?

46:21.846 --> 46:22.812
Yeah.

46:22.814 --> 46:23.546
I'd like to.

46:29.087 --> 46:33.489
The lady from Montreal
left some nice things behind

46:33.491 --> 46:34.991
at the house.

46:34.993 --> 46:36.325
She told me I could
take whatever I want.

46:41.366 --> 46:42.231
Here.

46:50.141 --> 46:51.140
Uh.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.008
Yeah, here.

46:54.412 --> 46:55.378
See what fits.

47:36.988 --> 47:40.056
I always hid the ladder.

47:40.058 --> 47:41.490
[gun shots]

47:42.427 --> 47:43.392
[screams]

47:45.964 --> 47:47.363
Lea.

47:47.365 --> 47:48.998
Lea, what is it?

47:49.000 --> 47:50.466
What is it?

47:50.468 --> 47:52.168
What is it?

47:52.170 --> 47:53.135
I can't breathe!

47:56.407 --> 47:57.506
Put your head
between your legs.

47:57.508 --> 47:59.609
Put your head between your legs.

47:59.611 --> 48:01.944
[gasping]

48:01.946 --> 48:03.346
Look at me.
Look at me.

48:03.348 --> 48:04.914
Look at me.
Stop.

48:04.916 --> 48:05.882
Stop sobbing.

48:05.884 --> 48:09.051
Focus, breathe.

48:09.053 --> 48:10.553
Breathe, Lea.

48:10.555 --> 48:12.221
Again.

48:12.223 --> 48:14.657
Breathe, for God's sake!

48:14.659 --> 48:17.126
Deep breaths.

48:17.128 --> 48:18.127
Good.

48:18.129 --> 48:19.295
OK, I'll get you some water.

48:22.567 --> 48:24.300
Bill, please say something.

48:29.307 --> 48:30.940
Here, drink this.

48:30.942 --> 48:31.641
Take it.

48:37.615 --> 48:40.216
[vomiting]

48:40.218 --> 48:41.117
What is it?

48:43.288 --> 48:44.220
Take it easy.

48:44.222 --> 48:47.056
Take it easy.

48:47.058 --> 48:49.959
What is it?

48:49.961 --> 48:52.662
Oh, god.

48:52.664 --> 48:54.196
I remember.

48:54.198 --> 48:56.299
I remember.

48:56.301 --> 48:57.166
Remember what?

49:01.105 --> 49:05.441
The day we left for Houston,
I came here to get my things.

49:05.443 --> 49:09.178
But he had taken my ladder.

49:09.180 --> 49:10.579
Who?

49:10.581 --> 49:12.114
Who, Jamie?
- Bill.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.349
And his name was Bill.

49:13.351 --> 49:16.452
And I followed him,
and we had a fight

49:16.454 --> 49:19.255
up at the old abandoned mines.

49:19.257 --> 49:20.589
And I had a gun.

49:20.591 --> 49:22.224
And I shot.

49:22.226 --> 49:24.660
I shot.

49:24.662 --> 49:27.530
I shot him.

49:27.532 --> 49:30.032
I killed him.

49:30.034 --> 49:31.367
What are you talking about?

49:31.369 --> 49:32.702
No, no, no.

49:32.704 --> 49:34.337
You're just very upset.

49:34.339 --> 49:35.972
And you didn't
want to leave here,

49:35.974 --> 49:38.140
and you made up some
story so your parents

49:38.142 --> 49:39.075
couldn't take you away.

49:39.077 --> 49:40.643
No, I remember.

49:40.645 --> 49:42.178
I went to your house,
but weren't there.

49:42.180 --> 49:43.713
And I got a rope
and a flashlight.

49:43.715 --> 49:45.014
- No.
- From your shed.

49:45.016 --> 49:46.148
No, no, no.

49:46.150 --> 49:48.250
You always had a
wild imagination.

49:48.252 --> 49:49.418
You were hiding.

49:49.420 --> 49:50.987
You were hiding.

49:50.989 --> 49:52.154
You didn't want to leave,
and you were hiding.

49:52.156 --> 49:53.055
Your parents.
[interposing voices]

49:53.057 --> 49:54.357
Your parents called me!

49:54.359 --> 49:56.092
No, you have to believe me!

49:58.563 --> 50:01.731
I ran back to the mines,
but it was getting dark,

50:01.733 --> 50:04.367
and I couldn't see him.

50:04.369 --> 50:08.237
Then there was this
scary man and a dog.

50:08.239 --> 50:12.341
And I freaked, and I
left him there to die.

50:12.343 --> 50:13.609
Listen.

50:13.611 --> 50:15.344
Listen, I don't know
what happened to you

50:15.346 --> 50:18.414
after you left here, but
these pills you're taking

50:18.416 --> 50:20.182
are making you crazy.

50:20.184 --> 50:21.517
You don't believe me.

50:21.519 --> 50:22.785
No.

50:22.787 --> 50:25.287
No, I don't believe
you killed anybody.

50:25.289 --> 50:27.690
Why would I make
something like this up?

50:34.165 --> 50:35.364
Where are you going now?

50:35.366 --> 50:37.033
To the mine shaft.

50:37.035 --> 50:38.234
No one disappeared there.

50:38.236 --> 50:39.668
You don't believe me anyway.

50:39.670 --> 50:41.170
Because it's not true.

50:41.172 --> 50:42.338
Because it's a
fabrication of yours.

50:42.340 --> 50:44.607
Sam, I need to know.

50:44.609 --> 50:46.475
Well, I'm going with you.

51:26.784 --> 51:27.750
It was here.

52:14.232 --> 52:16.198
[gasps]

52:32.650 --> 52:33.549
That's it.

52:37.188 --> 52:38.554
All right.

52:38.556 --> 52:40.556
Let's get outta here.

52:40.558 --> 52:43.259
I found an opening.

52:43.261 --> 52:45.928
It might not be him.

52:45.930 --> 52:47.463
He could've gotten out.

52:47.465 --> 52:48.464
Come on.

52:48.466 --> 52:50.466
Come on.

52:50.468 --> 52:51.867
Come on.

52:51.869 --> 52:53.235
Why don't you go ahead.

52:53.237 --> 52:54.803
I'll be right behind
you, all right?

53:14.625 --> 53:15.491
Hungry?

53:44.755 --> 53:48.324
I'll see you back in
what, six months or so?

53:48.326 --> 53:49.692
Bye.

53:49.694 --> 53:50.693
Hi.

53:50.695 --> 53:52.728
Sam, hi.

53:52.730 --> 53:53.796
What a surprise.

53:53.798 --> 53:55.564
Yeah, it's been
a while, I know.

53:55.566 --> 53:56.832
Yeah.

53:56.834 --> 53:58.467
Do you want to make
an appointment?

53:58.469 --> 54:00.836
No, no.

54:00.838 --> 54:02.838
I have a favor to ask.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.373
OK.

54:04.375 --> 54:06.308
What's that?

54:06.310 --> 54:08.244
I found it.

54:08.246 --> 54:11.347
It's human, right?

54:11.349 --> 54:12.982
Yeah, it looks like it.

54:12.984 --> 54:14.850
You should go to the police.

54:14.852 --> 54:16.385
I will.

54:16.387 --> 54:19.421
I just need you to tell
me the approximate age.

54:19.423 --> 54:21.457
Sam, where did you find this?

54:21.459 --> 54:25.461
Out in the woods.

54:25.463 --> 54:26.929
OK, I'll take a
look at it, but you

54:26.931 --> 54:28.731
need to come back later.

54:28.733 --> 54:29.665
I will.

54:29.667 --> 54:30.966
Right.

54:30.968 --> 54:32.801
How's Jamie?

54:32.803 --> 54:33.869
Oh, he's good.

54:33.871 --> 54:34.837
Yeah, he got married.

54:34.839 --> 54:35.771
Oh, good.

54:35.773 --> 54:36.672
Good.

54:36.674 --> 54:38.007
I'll come back later.

54:38.009 --> 54:38.907
OK.

54:53.057 --> 54:54.790
Nothing.

54:54.792 --> 54:58.394
I checked the local papers
from June to August of the year

54:58.396 --> 54:59.795
we left.

54:59.797 --> 55:00.963
I told you.

55:00.965 --> 55:04.600
That doesn't
prove anything, Sam.

55:04.602 --> 55:05.801
What about his family?

55:05.803 --> 55:06.969
Do you remember anybody
from his family?

55:11.709 --> 55:13.976
I saw someone
familiar yesterday.

55:18.516 --> 55:21.717
I think I saw his mother, but
I'm not sure if it was her.

55:21.719 --> 55:23.352
Where was that?

55:23.354 --> 55:24.086
At the church.

55:27.525 --> 55:29.458
Well, we gotta go find her.

55:32.463 --> 55:34.430
I don't have the
stomach for it.

55:34.432 --> 55:36.799
I think she's going to
tell you that he's alive.

55:39.603 --> 55:42.604
Can you imagine
facing the person

55:42.606 --> 55:44.640
who might be responsible
for killing your son?

55:47.545 --> 55:50.479
I think she's going
to tell you he's alive.

55:50.481 --> 55:51.413
Come on.

55:51.415 --> 55:52.381
Let's go home.

56:15.506 --> 56:17.539
Hi.

56:17.541 --> 56:20.008
Hello there.

56:20.010 --> 56:22.678
This is a beautiful church.

56:22.680 --> 56:25.047
I wouldn't want
to be anywhere else.

56:25.049 --> 56:26.915
I grew up here.

56:26.917 --> 56:31.120
Passed it a million times,
but I never came in.

56:31.122 --> 56:34.757
What is it that
brings you here now?

56:34.759 --> 56:37.526
I'm looking for someone.

56:37.528 --> 56:40.729
I think her name is Molly.

56:40.731 --> 56:42.631
Oh, Molly Mackenzie.

56:42.633 --> 56:44.933
Yes.

56:44.935 --> 56:47.569
I'm actually
looking for her son.

56:47.571 --> 56:50.472
Does he attend
services here too?

56:50.474 --> 56:51.874
No.

56:51.876 --> 56:52.775
Just Molly.

57:00.618 --> 57:05.554
How can we be forgiven, when
we can't forgive ourselves?

57:05.556 --> 57:08.590
He is all forgiving.

57:08.592 --> 57:11.493
To have that kind of faith.

57:11.495 --> 57:12.161
It lightens the burden.

57:16.634 --> 57:18.667
Do you know where
I could find Molly?

57:18.669 --> 57:20.102
Maybe an address or something?

57:20.104 --> 57:21.804
I'd like to write her a note.

57:21.806 --> 57:24.173
Yeah.

57:24.175 --> 57:31.113
She is at 32 Lincoln Road.

57:31.115 --> 57:32.014
Thanks.

57:35.953 --> 57:36.952
Our doors are always open.

57:53.771 --> 57:55.103
What can I do for you?

57:59.109 --> 58:00.576
My name's Lea.

58:00.578 --> 58:04.179
Didn't we meet yesterday?

58:04.181 --> 58:06.915
Come in.

58:06.917 --> 58:07.816
Come in.

58:28.072 --> 58:29.204
How do we know each other?

58:29.206 --> 58:30.072
In church?

58:34.979 --> 58:36.144
I knew your son.

58:40.551 --> 58:42.818
Here they are.

58:42.820 --> 58:43.919
My kids.

58:43.921 --> 58:45.120
[laughs]

58:46.624 --> 58:48.824
They are good kids, my kids.

58:52.563 --> 58:54.930
Where are they now?

58:54.932 --> 58:57.866
They're gone.

58:57.868 --> 59:00.702
They're both gone.

59:00.704 --> 59:03.739
But alive, right?

59:03.741 --> 59:04.673
They're all gone.

59:09.046 --> 59:09.912
Gone where?

59:12.983 --> 59:13.882
Where is Bill now?

59:18.188 --> 59:20.289
You mean New York?

59:20.291 --> 59:21.890
We haven't talked
for a long time.

59:26.297 --> 59:29.865
So he's alive?

59:29.867 --> 59:32.601
He better be.

59:32.603 --> 59:33.635
What is it you want from him?

59:40.177 --> 59:43.011
I just want to get
in contact with him.

59:43.013 --> 59:46.281
Maybe I can leave my
phone number and address,

59:46.283 --> 59:50.852
and you can tell me
I've been looking for--

59:50.854 --> 59:52.821
How do you know Billy?

59:52.823 --> 59:53.956
There's not a lot
of people who come

59:53.958 --> 59:55.958
around here asking for him.

59:55.960 --> 59:58.093
Uh.

59:58.095 --> 1:00:03.632
I'll leave the address of
where I'm staying here as well.

1:00:03.634 --> 1:00:05.667
I never get good
phone service up here.

1:00:05.669 --> 1:00:06.935
I'm going to
call him right now.

1:00:11.108 --> 1:00:12.240
Bill?

1:00:12.242 --> 1:00:13.842
Billy?

1:00:13.844 --> 1:00:17.312
Hi boy, it's me.

1:00:17.314 --> 1:00:18.847
[clears throat]

1:00:18.849 --> 1:00:22.918
There's someone here
who's asking about you.

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:24.219
What's your name again?

1:00:24.221 --> 1:00:25.187
Lea.

1:00:25.189 --> 1:00:26.121
Her name--

1:00:26.123 --> 1:00:27.055
[coughs]

1:00:27.057 --> 1:00:27.956
[inaudible]

1:00:32.863 --> 1:00:35.163
Hello?

1:00:35.165 --> 1:00:36.031
Hello?

1:00:41.639 --> 1:00:43.005
[phone rings]

1:00:49.413 --> 1:00:50.779
Bill?

1:00:50.781 --> 1:00:52.047
Billy?

1:00:52.049 --> 1:00:54.883
Hi boy, it's me.

1:00:54.885 --> 1:00:56.318
[clears throat]

1:00:56.320 --> 1:00:59.221
There's somebody here who's
asking about you, name--

1:01:02.226 --> 1:01:03.158
[car honks]

1:01:05.195 --> 1:01:06.194
What happened?

1:01:06.196 --> 1:01:07.095
Who was that on the phone?

1:01:10.034 --> 1:01:11.366
My mother.

1:01:11.368 --> 1:01:12.868
Is she OK?

1:01:12.870 --> 1:01:14.036
I'm not sure.

1:01:21.345 --> 1:01:24.112
He's alive.

1:01:24.114 --> 1:01:25.047
I told you.

1:01:25.049 --> 1:01:27.849
I saw his mother.

1:01:27.851 --> 1:01:29.284
What did she say about him?

1:01:29.286 --> 1:01:30.318
She wasn't coherent.

1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:32.287
She's pretty drunk.

1:01:32.289 --> 1:01:33.855
They don't seem to
have much contact,

1:01:33.857 --> 1:01:36.324
but she tried to reach out.

1:01:40.264 --> 1:01:44.199
Bill, wait up.

1:01:44.201 --> 1:01:47.102
I'm meeting Susan
and Heather tonight.

1:01:47.104 --> 1:01:48.904
Want to come?

1:01:48.906 --> 1:01:49.805
Not today.

1:01:49.807 --> 1:01:51.039
I've got things to do.

1:01:51.041 --> 1:01:52.174
Are you sure?

1:01:52.176 --> 1:01:53.408
Susan really
seems to like you.

1:01:53.410 --> 1:01:54.409
Yeah.

1:01:54.411 --> 1:01:55.410
I wish I could say the same.

1:01:55.412 --> 1:01:56.878
Ooh.

1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:57.779
I'll see you later.

1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:10.759
[blows]

1:02:10.761 --> 1:02:11.426
Shit.

1:02:51.435 --> 1:02:52.334
Look.

1:02:57.341 --> 1:02:58.940
I'm dizzy.

1:02:58.942 --> 1:03:05.847
[siren wails]

1:03:09.887 --> 1:03:10.886
There's our jumper.

1:03:10.888 --> 1:03:12.354
Let's go.

1:03:12.356 --> 1:03:17.092
[chatter on radio]

1:03:17.094 --> 1:03:18.460
Bill.

1:03:18.462 --> 1:03:20.195
Give me a moment.

1:03:20.197 --> 1:03:21.863
Are you serious?

1:03:21.865 --> 1:03:22.564
You go, please.

1:03:32.409 --> 1:03:33.408

1:03:33.410 --> 1:03:35.343
[gasps]

1:03:41.385 --> 1:03:44.186
What happened?

1:03:44.188 --> 1:03:45.053
What are you doing?

1:03:50.127 --> 1:03:51.459
Here.

1:03:51.461 --> 1:03:53.128
Take it.
- No.

1:03:53.130 --> 1:03:54.095
Take it, I said!

1:03:54.097 --> 1:03:54.996
No.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:56.131
No more of this.

1:03:56.133 --> 1:03:57.132
I can't get better for you.

1:03:57.134 --> 1:03:58.333
It doesn't work like that.

1:03:58.335 --> 1:04:00.068
I don't have your
kind of strength.

1:04:00.070 --> 1:04:02.337
What makes you think
that I'm so strong?

1:04:02.339 --> 1:04:04.239
You want me to get better?

1:04:04.241 --> 1:04:06.575
I want to too, but
it is not working.

1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:11.112

1:04:21.058 --> 1:04:22.023

1:04:24.428 --> 1:04:25.360
Who is it?

1:04:28.966 --> 1:04:29.931
I know her.

1:04:34.304 --> 1:04:36.338
Bill.

1:04:36.340 --> 1:04:37.606
That's my professor's daughter.

1:04:37.608 --> 1:04:38.473
How do you know her?

1:04:47.184 --> 1:04:49.417
You keep in contact with him?

1:04:49.419 --> 1:04:52.587
Ran into him just
recently, in the hospital.

1:04:52.589 --> 1:04:53.955
You were there.

1:04:53.957 --> 1:04:54.656
Why?

1:05:01.565 --> 1:05:04.299
I want to know
what became of her.

1:05:04.301 --> 1:05:06.568
Oh.

1:05:06.570 --> 1:05:08.270
You knew her as kids?

1:05:08.272 --> 1:05:10.972
Yeah, sort of.

1:05:10.974 --> 1:05:14.643
You could say I have a
long-lasting memory of her.

1:05:14.645 --> 1:05:15.644
Wow.

1:05:15.646 --> 1:05:18.346
That's quite a coincidence.

1:05:18.348 --> 1:05:19.314
I'll ask him.

1:05:28.492 --> 1:05:30.992
BILL: Help!

1:05:30.994 --> 1:05:31.693
Help!

1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:38.600
Leon's excited about
the fact that you

1:05:38.602 --> 1:05:40.969
knew his daughter as children.

1:05:40.971 --> 1:05:42.304
Hopes you guys can reconnect.

1:05:45.475 --> 1:05:47.475
Wow.

1:05:47.477 --> 1:05:50.078
You're not as excited as
Leon about reconnecting.

1:05:53.116 --> 1:05:55.650
Well, good luck.

1:05:55.652 --> 1:05:59.421
Thanks, Danny.

1:05:59.423 --> 1:06:01.222
Sam.

1:06:01.224 --> 1:06:04.559
I want to apologize.

1:06:04.561 --> 1:06:07.128
Please, wait a moment.

1:06:07.130 --> 1:06:09.364
Wait.

1:06:09.366 --> 1:06:11.533
I really appreciate what
you're trying to do for me.

1:06:11.535 --> 1:06:14.202
I'm just-- I'm not ready.

1:06:14.204 --> 1:06:17.706
And I feel pressured,
and it doesn't help.

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:19.407
When you left and I
never heard from you,

1:06:19.409 --> 1:06:22.110
I wiped you completely
out of my mind.

1:06:22.112 --> 1:06:23.578
I learned how to lose people.

1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:26.181
And when you came back,
it was sort of a shock.

1:06:26.183 --> 1:06:29.017
You changed so much.

1:06:29.019 --> 1:06:31.453
I didn't recognize the
girl that I used to know.

1:06:31.455 --> 1:06:34.289
I wanted the old Lea back.

1:06:34.291 --> 1:06:40.762
But now-- more importantly, now,
I don't want to lose you again.

1:07:12.629 --> 1:07:13.528
Shit.

1:07:29.546 --> 1:07:31.513
[knocks on door]

1:08:46.189 --> 1:08:48.356
Bill.

1:08:48.358 --> 1:08:49.257
What are you doing?

1:08:51.695 --> 1:08:52.627
She fell.

1:08:52.629 --> 1:08:53.595
I'm helping her.

1:08:53.597 --> 1:08:55.196

1:08:55.198 --> 1:08:56.397
Mom.

1:08:56.399 --> 1:08:58.266
[inaudible] Put that on there.

1:08:58.268 --> 1:08:59.200
Hold it.

1:08:59.202 --> 1:09:01.436
Thank you.

1:09:01.438 --> 1:09:03.204
I'm gonna put a
bandage on it, OK?

1:09:03.206 --> 1:09:03.905
All right.

1:09:07.210 --> 1:09:08.810
Just hold that there.

1:09:08.812 --> 1:09:11.746
Two seconds.

1:09:11.748 --> 1:09:14.716
All right, here.

1:09:14.718 --> 1:09:16.351
There you go.

1:09:16.353 --> 1:09:17.285
Is that better?

1:09:17.287 --> 1:09:18.353
Yeah.

1:09:18.355 --> 1:09:19.521
OK.

1:09:19.523 --> 1:09:20.655
Hey, you want to
go on an adventure?

1:09:20.657 --> 1:09:21.556
Yeah.

1:09:21.558 --> 1:09:22.457
Yeah?

1:09:28.465 --> 1:09:29.564
All right, we have to go.

1:09:29.566 --> 1:09:31.166
I want to stay here.

1:09:31.168 --> 1:09:32.467
Can I take them?

1:09:32.469 --> 1:09:33.635
No, they belong to someone.

1:09:33.637 --> 1:09:35.203
Just one.

1:09:35.205 --> 1:09:35.937
Please?

1:09:35.939 --> 1:09:36.938
Fine.

1:09:36.940 --> 1:09:39.174
Just one, but we have to go.

1:09:39.176 --> 1:09:41.910
Can we come back tomorrow?

1:09:41.912 --> 1:09:42.777
Sure.

1:09:51.321 --> 1:09:56.257
[phone rings]

1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:57.792
Ariel?

1:09:57.794 --> 1:09:59.694
I was just thinking about you.

1:09:59.696 --> 1:10:01.262
Mom's in the hospital.

1:10:01.264 --> 1:10:02.530
Didn't they call you?

1:10:02.532 --> 1:10:04.365
No, what happened?

1:10:04.367 --> 1:10:06.267
I think it's
serious this time.

1:10:06.269 --> 1:10:07.669
You need to go up there.

1:10:07.671 --> 1:10:09.637
Well, what did they say?

1:10:09.639 --> 1:10:11.239
Heart failure.

1:10:11.241 --> 1:10:12.707
Look, I know it's the
last thing you want to do,

1:10:12.709 --> 1:10:16.211
but I really don't have
money for a flight right now.

1:10:16.213 --> 1:10:19.380
All right, text me
the address and phone

1:10:19.382 --> 1:10:20.348
number of the hospital.

1:10:24.221 --> 1:10:25.720
How's the record coming along?

1:10:25.722 --> 1:10:29.224
Have you listened to
the track I sent you?

1:10:29.226 --> 1:10:29.891
It's good.

1:10:59.489 --> 1:11:00.455
What are you making?

1:11:04.527 --> 1:11:08.896
She's like a doll, but
she's made of broken pieces.

1:11:12.402 --> 1:11:14.769
Do you want her?

1:11:14.771 --> 1:11:17.338
She's not as pretty and
perfect as your doll.

1:11:34.691 --> 1:11:37.392
Patricia, Jamie's
mother, called me.

1:11:37.394 --> 1:11:43.298
She said that the jaw was
between 40 or 50 years old.

1:11:47.304 --> 1:11:48.369
I still need to find Bill.

1:12:59.943 --> 1:13:03.711
Since when are we sharing?

1:13:03.713 --> 1:13:06.414
Dad, I'm sorry.

1:13:06.416 --> 1:13:08.783
Sorry my ass.

1:13:08.785 --> 1:13:11.419
Who's paying for the booze?

1:13:11.421 --> 1:13:12.687
And where's my gun?

1:13:12.689 --> 1:13:14.455
I come out here to get a beer.

1:13:14.457 --> 1:13:17.425
Now, where-- huh?

1:13:17.427 --> 1:13:21.763
[crying]

1:13:21.765 --> 1:13:22.697
Where is my gun?

1:13:22.699 --> 1:13:23.631
Mom, help me!

1:13:23.633 --> 1:13:24.499
Mom!

1:13:25.935 --> 1:13:26.801
Mom.

1:13:33.843 --> 1:13:34.709
Billy?

1:13:37.714 --> 1:13:39.046
What are you doing here?

1:13:43.052 --> 1:13:44.419
Come sit with me!

1:13:47.791 --> 1:13:48.856
Where's Ariel?

1:13:48.858 --> 1:13:49.757
She's in LA.

1:13:53.496 --> 1:13:54.862
It's so good to see you.

1:13:58.435 --> 1:14:00.168
It's been a very long time.

1:14:06.609 --> 1:14:07.475
So, what happened?

1:14:11.114 --> 1:14:12.547
I collapsed at work.

1:14:15.151 --> 1:14:16.184
Were you drunk?

1:14:23.193 --> 1:14:26.761
There was a--

1:14:26.763 --> 1:14:31.632
there was a girl who
came by looking for you.

1:14:31.634 --> 1:14:34.569
BILL: What did she want?

1:14:34.571 --> 1:14:37.872
She didn't say.

1:14:37.874 --> 1:14:40.608
Does she have a name?

1:14:40.610 --> 1:14:41.642
I think her name was Lea.

1:14:51.221 --> 1:14:53.087
I'm sorry, Billy.

1:14:53.089 --> 1:14:56.524
BILL: It's OK, Mom.

1:14:56.526 --> 1:14:58.559
I don't want to talk about it.

1:14:58.561 --> 1:14:59.260
It's all in the past.

1:15:06.936 --> 1:15:07.068
I'll come back tomorrow.

1:15:11.875 --> 1:15:15.610
I'll stay at your
place, if that's OK.

1:15:15.612 --> 1:15:17.912
The keys are in my purse.

1:15:27.757 --> 1:15:28.923
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:15:44.541 --> 1:15:45.206
Hello?

1:15:51.848 --> 1:15:52.780
Mrs. Mackenzie?

1:15:57.086 --> 1:15:57.952
Hi.

1:16:00.890 --> 1:16:02.089
I'm--

1:16:02.091 --> 1:16:04.158
I know who you are.

1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:06.227
I was actually
looking for you.

1:16:06.229 --> 1:16:07.194
I heard.

1:16:07.196 --> 1:16:08.195
Very late, though.

1:16:08.197 --> 1:16:09.096
Yes, I know.

1:16:09.098 --> 1:16:10.097
Do you know what?

1:16:10.099 --> 1:16:10.965
Save your breath.

1:16:13.803 --> 1:16:16.337
You know, you've got some nerve
showing up here 12 years later.

1:16:21.878 --> 1:16:23.210
I mean, what kind of
kid does that, huh?

1:16:23.212 --> 1:16:26.881
What kind of kid leaves
another kid in a shaft?

1:16:26.883 --> 1:16:28.349
So why are you here, huh?

1:16:28.351 --> 1:16:30.251
Why now?

1:16:30.253 --> 1:16:31.152
You've done enough already.

1:16:35.758 --> 1:16:36.791
You want my forgiveness?

1:16:36.793 --> 1:16:39.794
Please, let me explain.

1:16:39.796 --> 1:16:43.698
I don't want to hear it.

1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:44.632
I can't.

1:16:49.806 --> 1:16:50.705
Just leave.

1:19:14.484 --> 1:19:15.382
Thanks, Sam.

1:19:18.488 --> 1:19:20.054
For everything.

1:19:27.830 --> 1:19:29.330
You're doing the best you can.

1:20:21.984 --> 1:20:22.883
Hi.

1:20:28.925 --> 1:20:34.028
Is this-- is this
your parents' place?

1:20:34.030 --> 1:20:35.930
No.

1:20:35.932 --> 1:20:37.164
They don't live here anymore.

1:20:59.488 --> 1:21:02.156
I could do this for hours.

1:21:02.158 --> 1:21:03.390
Anything was better
than being at home.

1:21:14.136 --> 1:21:15.035
I was so scared.

1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:22.443
I could hear you calling,
and then you were gone.

1:21:30.653 --> 1:21:34.221
I went to your house to
try and tell your mother,

1:21:34.223 --> 1:21:35.122
but she didn't listen.

1:21:37.994 --> 1:21:40.995
We were leaving that
night to move to Houston.

1:21:40.997 --> 1:21:46.667
I tried to tell my parents,
but they didn't believe me.

1:21:46.669 --> 1:21:49.937
They insisted it
was my imagination.

1:21:49.939 --> 1:21:52.306
After we moved, I got
messed up and confused,

1:21:52.308 --> 1:21:55.309
and I just blocked
it out of my mind.

1:21:55.311 --> 1:21:58.112
Wasn't until I came here
a few days ago that I

1:21:58.114 --> 1:22:01.916
remembered what happened.

1:22:01.918 --> 1:22:03.083
I thought I had killed you.

1:22:06.188 --> 1:22:08.923
I know you must
think I'm a coward.

1:22:11.127 --> 1:22:12.026
I'm sorry.

1:22:20.603 --> 1:22:21.502
How did you get out?

1:22:27.643 --> 1:22:30.477
A dog.

1:22:30.479 --> 1:22:31.512
A dog appeared out of nowhere.

1:22:31.514 --> 1:22:32.413
Let me out.

1:22:38.554 --> 1:22:42.022
Why did you hide the ladder

1:22:42.024 --> 1:22:48.295
It was a prank it
was a childish prank

1:22:48.297 --> 1:22:52.533
I mean, I had no idea you
were leaving that night.

1:22:52.535 --> 1:22:56.704
I guess I just
wanted you to be--

1:22:59.976 --> 1:23:01.508
be aware of me.

1:23:01.510 --> 1:23:04.611
You seemed so free, and--

1:23:04.613 --> 1:23:06.080
Did I shoot you?

1:23:12.054 --> 1:23:14.521
My father was furious.

1:23:14.523 --> 1:23:17.691
I lost his gun.

1:23:17.693 --> 1:23:20.294
Where's my gun?

1:23:20.296 --> 1:23:22.262
I know you took it.

1:23:22.264 --> 1:23:24.198
Where is it?

1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:25.232
Talk!

1:23:25.234 --> 1:23:26.166
Stop, Frank.

1:23:26.168 --> 1:23:28.602
You're killing him!

1:23:28.604 --> 1:23:32.473
[gasping]

1:23:33.509 --> 1:23:35.442
[crying]

1:23:39.482 --> 1:23:40.781
Can we take this out?

1:23:44.387 --> 1:23:45.285
Sure.

1:24:01.704 --> 1:24:03.404
Parenting wasn't
their strengths.

1:24:06.208 --> 1:24:07.508
Most of the time, they
were wasted anyway.

1:24:10.513 --> 1:24:14.081
Morning after I got
out of the mine,

1:24:14.083 --> 1:24:17.051
our family totally collapsed.

1:24:21.524 --> 1:24:22.423
Bill.

1:24:25.428 --> 1:24:27.428
Billy.

1:24:27.430 --> 1:24:28.395
Wake up.

1:24:32.835 --> 1:24:34.535
I want us to go
look for the gun.

1:24:38.674 --> 1:24:43.477
I found the gun, and
he made me promise that I

1:24:43.479 --> 1:24:49.083
would never touch a gun again.

1:24:49.085 --> 1:24:51.351
Ever.

1:24:51.353 --> 1:24:53.654
And then he sat down.

1:24:53.656 --> 1:24:56.457
Told me to go on ahead.

1:24:56.459 --> 1:24:58.425
And that was the--

1:24:58.427 --> 1:25:00.227
that was the last
time I ever saw him.

1:25:05.167 --> 1:25:08.268
He left us that day.

1:25:08.270 --> 1:25:11.738
You never looked for him?

1:25:11.740 --> 1:25:13.874
I don't think he
wanted to be found.

1:25:17.746 --> 1:25:18.512
Why do you think that?

1:25:18.513 --> 1:25:19.279
I think he killed himself.

1:25:27.590 --> 1:25:31.325
When I was looking for
you, I went down in the mine.

1:25:35.297 --> 1:25:36.597
There were human remains there.

1:26:29.952 --> 1:26:30.951
[yells]

1:26:30.953 --> 1:26:32.519
[splash]

1:26:34.623 --> 1:26:37.357
BILL (VOICEOVER): We
moved here when I was 13.

1:26:37.359 --> 1:26:39.293
BILL: Nice one.

1:26:39.295 --> 1:26:41.929
BILL (VOICEOVER): My dad had
just finished a tour of Iraq.

1:26:41.931 --> 1:26:45.365
His last one.

1:26:45.367 --> 1:26:49.336
He wasn't always
a senseless drunk.

1:26:49.338 --> 1:26:50.737
Hey Dad, can we go swimming?

1:26:57.680 --> 1:26:59.680
I dare you.

1:26:59.682 --> 1:27:01.215
[laughs]

1:27:04.220 --> 1:27:05.986
[yells]

1:27:10.259 --> 1:27:10.924
Whoo!

1:27:15.297 --> 1:27:15.963
Whoo!

1:27:28.677 --> 1:27:29.576
You OK?

1:27:36.752 --> 1:27:37.651
You?

1:27:41.590 --> 1:27:43.457
I will be.
