00:02.330 --> 00:05.322
*

00:10.110 --> 00:11.259
- THAT WAS YOUR TEACHER.

00:11.310 --> 00:12.504
APPARENTLY, YOU WERE
THE ONLY ONE IN CLASS

00:12.540 --> 00:14.405
WHO DIDN'T TURN IN
HIS ART ASSIGNMENT.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.101
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE
AN EMPTY SPACE

00:16.150 --> 00:17.674
ON THE WALL
AT OPEN HOUSE TONIGHT.

00:17.710 --> 00:21.339
- UH, ACTUALLY, DAD,
I'M PRETTY SURE I DID FINISH IT.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.280
IT SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE IT WAS STOLEN.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.618
- OH, SO SOMEBODY
BREAKS INTO THE SCHOOL,

00:25.650 --> 00:27.413
AND THE ONLY THING THEY STEAL
IS YOUR PAINTING?

00:27.460 --> 00:28.859
WHY'S THAT?

00:28.890 --> 00:30.448
- BECAUSE
IT'S THE PERFECT CRIME.

00:31.890 --> 00:33.426
- SIT.

00:37.470 --> 00:41.167
SHAWN, THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS A PERFECT CRIME.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.201
MAKE SOMETHING PRETTY.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.874
- LASSIE, WOW.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.808
IS YOUR HAIR
STARTING ITS OWN CULT?

00:57.850 --> 01:00.512
- TRYING TO DO A PERFORMANCE
REVIEW HERE, MR. SPENCER.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.879
I THANK YOU NOT TO BOTHER US.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.956
- THAT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE
THING TO THANK ME FOR,

01:03.990 --> 01:05.287
BUT YOU'RE WELCOME,
OF COURSE.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.150
AND NOW,
AS A SHOW OF GRATITUDE,

01:07.200 --> 01:08.895
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE ADVANCE
ON OUR NEXT CASE?

01:08.930 --> 01:10.090
- YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE NOT

01:10.130 --> 01:11.392
AN ACTUAL EMPLOYEE
OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT?

01:11.430 --> 01:14.035
- DEFINE "ACTUAL,"
WAIT, DEFINE "POLICE," WAIT--

01:14.070 --> 01:16.038
- I'M NOT GIVING YOU AN ADVANCE
ON A CASE THAT MAY

01:16.070 --> 01:17.958
OR MAY NOT HAPPEN
IN THE FUTURE.

01:18.010 --> 01:19.739
- OH, OH, OH, OH, OH--

01:19.780 --> 01:22.248
PERHAPS I KNOW SOMETHING
YOU DON'T.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.077
NO?
WELL, LET'S BE HONEST.

01:24.110 --> 01:26.249
IT'S NOT LIKE CRIME IS GOING
TO SUDDENLY STOP, IS IT, GUS?

01:26.280 --> 01:27.508
- SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY.

01:27.550 --> 01:29.313
- OUT.
- SO THAT'S A NO ON THE ADVANCE.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.988
- PARDON ME FOR ASKING
THE OBVIOUS QUESTION,

01:31.020 --> 01:32.180
BUT HOW ARE YOU OUT OF MONEY?

01:32.220 --> 01:34.211
YOU HAVE NO POSSESSIONS
AND NO EXPENSES.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.455
- THAT'S MOSTLY TRUE.
- THAT'S COMPLETELY TRUE.

01:36.490 --> 01:39.050
- BUT GUS AND I ALSO HAVE
A BIG SKI VACATION PLANNED.

01:39.090 --> 01:40.626
- SKI VACATION?

01:40.660 --> 01:42.890
MR. SPENCER,
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.966
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND SNOW
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR?

01:51.910 --> 01:53.878
- ARE WE EVER GONNA START
SKIING?

01:53.910 --> 01:55.673
- SOON AS I FINISH
THIS HOT CHOCOLATE.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.007
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
THROW IT OUT?

01:57.050 --> 01:59.518
- I WOULD, BUT THIS
HOT COCOA REPRESENTS

01:59.550 --> 02:00.915
THE END OF OUR VACATION MONEY.

02:00.950 --> 02:02.178
- HOW ARE WE OUT OF CASH?

02:02.220 --> 02:03.642
WE'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
FOUR HOURS.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.250
- THE AMERICAN DOLLAR WAS NOT
AS STRONG AS I ANTICIPATED, GUS.

02:06.290 --> 02:07.848
WHICH IS WHY I HAD
TO PUT THE WHOLE THING

02:07.890 --> 02:09.187
ON A CREDIT CARD.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.583
- YOU DON'T HAVE A CREDIT CARD,
SHAWN.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.655
- I SAID A CREDIT CARD,
NOT MY CREDIT CARD.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.588
IT'S YOUR CARD--THAT'S WHY
I'M BEING SO AGGRESSIVE

02:14.630 --> 02:16.029
ABOUT GETTING THE MONEY
TO PAY YOU BACK.

02:16.060 --> 02:17.493
HI, HI.
- HELLO.

02:17.530 --> 02:18.622
- SEE THAT?

02:18.670 --> 02:19.830
MAN, A MONTH AGO
I WOULD'VE HAD US

02:19.870 --> 02:21.132
STYLED UP
WITH THOSE GIRLS TONIGHT.

02:21.170 --> 02:24.037
- WHAT?
- BUT I'M SPOKEN FOR NOW.

02:24.070 --> 02:26.129
I HAVE ABIGAIL,
AND SHE HAS ME.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.171
- YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT HER THIS WHOLE TIME.

02:28.210 --> 02:29.939
WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING ABIGAIL
ON THIS TRIP?

02:29.980 --> 02:32.312
- GUS, YOU ARE MY BEST FRIEND.

02:32.350 --> 02:34.568
JUST BECAUSE I'VE ENTERED INTO
SOME NEWFANGLED RELATIONSHIP

02:34.620 --> 02:36.485
DOES NOT MEAN
THAT OUR GUY TIME...

02:39.090 --> 02:40.512
GOES BY THE WAYSIDE.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.529
- YOU KNOW, SHAWN, IF YOU'RE
GONNA KEEP STARING AT GIRLS,

02:43.560 --> 02:45.653
YOU CAN'T PREACH ABOUT HOW
COMMITTED YOU ARE TO ABIGAIL.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.089
- ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL,

02:47.130 --> 02:48.654
THE PERSON I'M STARING AT
IS A MAN.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.294

BUT A MAN NONETHELESS,
AND I...KNOW THAT GUY.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.789

02:55.840 --> 02:57.137
I THINK HE'S WEARING
$10,000 SKIS.

02:57.170 --> 02:59.001
ALL YOU OWN
IS THAT HOT CHOCOLATE.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.268
- NO, I'VE SEEN THIS GUY
BEFORE.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.470
I JUST CAN'T PLACE WHERE.

03:04.780 --> 03:07.078
- WELL, I CAN PLAY TOO!

03:07.120 --> 03:08.144
- I NEED YOU TO LIKE ME.

ERNESTO RAMON CHAVEZ.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.289

03:18.330 --> 03:20.195
YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE
IN LASSIE'S APARTMENT

03:20.230 --> 03:21.697
AND WE SAW
HIS WALL OF SUSPECT S?

03:21.730 --> 03:23.288
- YOU MEAN WHEN LASSITER
KILLED THAT GUY?

03:23.330 --> 03:25.093
- HE DIDN'T KILL HIM.
WE GOT HIM EXONERATED.

03:25.130 --> 03:26.631
I GOT PUNCHED
AND PISTOL-WHIPPED, REMEMBER?

03:26.670 --> 03:28.262
- I'M STILL NOT SURE
HE DIDN'T KILL THAT GUY.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.963

- LASSIE.

INTO YOUR APARTMENT IN WEEKS.

UP TO, JUST STOP, ALL RIGHT?

THERE'S NO NEED FOR A PSYCHIC
WITH AN ART THIEF.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.420
- HE'S AN ART THIEF?
- NO WAY.

03:50.460 --> 03:51.882
- A DANGEROUS ART THIEF,
RIGHT?

03:51.930 --> 03:53.022
NEVER BEEN CAUGHT,

03:53.060 --> 03:54.596
NEVER LEFT ENOUGH EVIDENCE
TO BE ACCUSED.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.154

THE CHASE--WHAT KIND OF REWARD

03:56.200 --> 03:57.269
ARE WE LOOKING AT
FOR CATCHING THIS GUY?

03:57.300 --> 03:58.858
- OR AN ADVANCE
FOR CATCHING HIM.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.992
- OR A FINDER'S FEE.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.393
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING
RIGHT AT HIM.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.759

ALL RIGHT?

04:02.810 --> 04:04.038
YOU HAVE NO JURISDICTION
UP THERE.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.231

04:25.490 --> 04:26.821
DO WE CALL THE AUTHORITIES?

04:26.860 --> 04:28.828

IT'S DESPEREAUX.

04:28.860 --> 04:31.192

TO SMOKE HIM OUT.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.198

09:01.040 --> 09:03.361
- I GOT NOTHING.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
- NOTHING.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.778
- I GOT IT.
- NO, YOU DON'T, SHAWN.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.243
- YES, I DO. SHH, SHH.
- IT'S OBVIOUS--

09:10.280 --> 09:12.248
DON'T TELL ME, DON'T TELL ME.
- SHUT UP!

09:12.280 --> 09:14.578
- SO, UH,
YOU WORK AS A PSYCH--

09:14.620 --> 09:16.417
- ED!

09:16.450 --> 09:19.317
YOU WOULDN'T BY CHANCE
BE CELEBRATING

09:19.350 --> 09:21.716
A BIRTHDAY ANNIVERSARY
ANY TIME SOON, WOULD YOU?

09:21.760 --> 09:23.284
- YOU KIDDING ME?

09:23.330 --> 09:24.627
- YES.
- NO.

09:24.660 --> 09:25.627
- YES.
- NO.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.548
- YES. YES.
- NO.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.990
- THAT'S AMAZING.
MY BIRTH DAY'S TODAY.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.736
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

09:32.770 --> 09:35.432
- IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.

09:37.970 --> 09:40.404
- LASSITER.
- HELLO THERE, CONSTABLE.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.704
THIS IS DEPUTY COMMISSIONER
ED DYKSTRA

09:42.750 --> 09:44.604
WITH THE VANCOUVER
R.C.M.P. OFFICE,

09:44.650 --> 09:47.847
AND I'M HERE WITH A COUPLE
FELLAS YOU WORK FOR,

09:47.880 --> 09:49.370
AND THEY HAVE
SOME PSYCHIC INFORMATION

09:49.420 --> 09:52.241
ABOUT A, UH,
PIERRE DESPEREAUX.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.611
YOU FAMILIAR WITH HIM?
- FAMILIAR?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.389
I'VE BEEN TRACKING THAT MAN
FOR SIX YEARS.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.354
I'M THE CLOSEST ANYONE'S
EVER GOTTEN TO CATCHING HIM.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.527
- HEY, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.198
IF YOU COULD JUST
SEND UP THOSE FILES,

10:01.230 --> 10:03.289
DETECTIVE SPENCER AND I
WOULD BE MUCH OBLIGED.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.059
- DETECTIVE?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:05.100 --> 10:06.658
DESPEREAUX IS NOT
TO BE MESSED WITH, OKAY?

10:06.700 --> 10:08.895
CHECK WITH INTERPOL--HE'S
CUNNING AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.737
AND IF HE IS UP THERE,
YOU WILL NEED

10:10.770 --> 10:11.862
MY EXPERTISE ON THIS.

10:11.910 --> 10:12.934
I KNOW ALL HIS PATTERNS.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.333
I WANT TO BE MADE
A FULL PARTNER ON THIS.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.177
- WELL, I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU BETTER RUN

10:16.210 --> 10:17.677
BY YOUR SUPERIOR HERE.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.439
- NO, NO--I DON'T WANT--
- HEY THERE, BUDDY.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.347
- SPENCER, YOU LISTEN TO ME,
AND YOU LISTEN GOOD.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.348
YOU DO NOT TOUCH DESPEREAUX.
YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.709
I WILL BE ON
THE NEXT FLIGHT UP THERE.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.615
- WELL, I SURE WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOU TOO, MAN,

10:27.660 --> 10:28.786
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY FOCUS

10:28.820 --> 10:30.082
ON YOUR CASE LOAD?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.449
I DON'T THINK THE CHIEF'S GOING
TO APPROVE THIS.

10:31.490 --> 10:33.822
- I HAVE 325 DAYS
OF UNUSED VACATION TIME.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.191
I WILL SEE YOU IN FIVE HOURS.

10:38.830 --> 10:41.435
CHIEF,
LITTLE FAVOR TO ASK.

10:47.740 --> 10:49.469
- I MEAN,
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

10:49.510 --> 10:51.444
A HIGH-RANKING MEMBER
OF THE U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT

10:51.480 --> 10:53.118
NOT BEING ALLOWED
TO CARRY HIS WEAPON ON HIM?

10:53.150 --> 10:54.469
- DID YOU REALLY THINK

10:54.520 --> 10:56.010
IT WOULDN'T SET OFF
THE METAL DETECTOR?

10:56.050 --> 10:57.608
- I'VE GOT TO GET MY HANDS
ON A GUN, O'HARA.

10:57.650 --> 10:58.810
I HAVE ENEMIES EVERYWHERE.

10:58.850 --> 11:00.158
MAYBE I CAN PICK ONE UP
AT THE HOTEL.

11:00.190 --> 11:01.350
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

11:01.390 --> 11:02.687
RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE GIFT SHOP.

11:02.730 --> 11:06.518
THEY HAVE KLEENEX, MIXED NUTS,
AND 9-MILLIMETER LUGERS.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.221
- THANKS FOR LETTING ME
USE YOUR MILES.

11:08.260 --> 11:09.295
- THANKS FOR BRINGING ME ALONG.

11:09.330 --> 11:10.399
- IF I DIDN'T BRING YOU ALONG,

11:10.430 --> 11:11.567
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME
USE YOUR MILES.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.737
- STILL, IT WAS REALLY SWEET.

11:12.770 --> 11:14.658
HI, SHAWN.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.588
WHAT?

11:16.640 --> 11:18.062
SEA TAXI TO FALSE CREEK.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.930
- NO, NO, TELL HIM WE'RE NOT
HERE ON A SIGHTSEEING MISSION.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.038
TELL HIM WE ARE HERE
ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS!

11:21.080 --> 11:22.331
- OKAY, OKAY.
GOT YOU.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.699
IT IS BUSINESS.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.741
LOOKS LIKE DESPEREAUX
ALREADY MADE HIS FIRST STRIKE.

11:25.780 --> 11:26.940
IT'S A CRIME SCENE.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.327
- UH, CAN I HELP YOU?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.679
- LISTEN, DUDLEY,
I'M DETECTIVE LASSITER

11:39.730 --> 11:41.220
AND THIS IS MY PARTNER,
JULIET O'HARA.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.420
WE'RE FROM THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.293
- OH, YOU WORK
FOR MR. SHAWN SPENCER.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.991
- [small laugh]

11:47.040 --> 11:49.133
- EH, SORRY.
SO SORRY.

11:49.170 --> 11:50.808
I'VE BEEN INSTRUCTED
NOT TO LET ANYONE IN

11:50.840 --> 11:53.035
WITHOUT CHECKING WITH
HEAD DETECTIVE SPENCER FIRST.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.638
- THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

11:54.680 --> 11:56.329
- BRACE YOURSELF, GUYS.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.574
HE NEVER STEALS A SINGLE ITEM.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.942
IT'S ALWAYS,
ALWAYS MULTIPLES.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.517
- THAT'S DIRECTLY FROM
MY REPORT--SPENCER!

12:02.550 --> 12:06.088
- SHH. DON'T INTERRUPT THE HEAD
DETECTIVE WHEN HE'S WORKING.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.417
[tuts]
- THE IONS ARE SPECIFICALLY

12:07.460 --> 12:11.954
CONCENTRATED HERE AND HERE.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.151
CRIME IONS.
WRITE THAT DOWN.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.156
- UH...

12:23.010 --> 12:25.865
THIS IS MR. LASSITER--
- DETECTIVE.

12:25.910 --> 12:29.107
- OKAY.
AND HIS PARTNER, JULIET O'HARA.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.949
THEY ARE FROM SANTA BARBARA.

12:30.980 --> 12:33.619
- WELCOME ABOARD.
GLAD YOU MADE IT OKAY.

12:33.650 --> 12:34.571
- HI, JULES.

12:34.620 --> 12:38.147
YOU LOOK...NORMAL AND STUFF.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.248
I GOT NOTHING.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.757
- UH, THIS IS MR. STOCKWELL,

12:40.790 --> 12:42.485
OWNER OF THE NECKLACE
IN QUESTION.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.953
- WELL, MR. STOCKWELL.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.321
MAY I CALL YOU GIBBY?

12:45.360 --> 12:46.952
- MY FIRST NAME IS RANDOLPH.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.297
- I'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.992
- HOW'S HE DOING?
- HE'S BEEN BETTER.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.691
- LET ME START BY SAYING,

12:52.730 --> 12:54.197
LET US NOT CRY
OVER SPILLED SYRUP.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.265
IF I'M BEING HONEST,
IT'S A LITTLE SILLY

12:56.300 --> 12:57.528
FOR A MAN OF YOUR STATURE

12:57.570 --> 12:58.559
TO WEAR A NECKLACE LIKE THIS,
DON'T YOU THINK?

12:58.610 --> 13:00.805
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:00.840 --> 13:02.034
- THE NECKLACE IS AN AUTHENTIC

13:02.080 --> 13:04.844
EDWARDIAN BAROQUE
CALIBER-CUT PIECE.

13:06.980 --> 13:10.108
IT IS WORTH $3.5 MILLION.

13:10.150 --> 13:13.187
- WHAT ARE WE TALKING?
CANADIAN DOLLARS?

13:16.090 --> 13:18.684
[inhales sharply]

13:18.730 --> 13:20.618
HE STOLE SOMETHING ELSE TOO.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.922
HE STOLE A PAINTING.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.167
ED, HE'S BETTER THAN I THOUGHT,
I'M AFRAID.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.418
- I SOLD THAT PAINTING
TWO WEEKS AGO.

13:28.740 --> 13:30.731
IF I MAY,
I'D LIKE TO DETERMINE

13:30.770 --> 13:32.362
WHETHER THIS WAS ACTUALLY
THE WORK OF DESPEREAUX.

13:32.410 --> 13:34.833
NOW, I ASSUME YOU FOUND
NO ALARMS TRIPPED?

13:34.880 --> 13:35.938
NO PRINTS?

13:35.980 --> 13:37.971
- NO, NONE--
BUT WE DID FIND

13:38.010 --> 13:40.444
A BURNING CIGARETTE
IN THE ASHTRAY OVER THERE.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.209
AND MR. STOCKWELL
IS NOT A SMOKER.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.808
- A MERCHANTEUSE BLONDE?

13:43.850 --> 13:45.249
- BLONDE?
WHERE'S THE BLONDE?

13:45.290 --> 13:46.416
I'LL NEED TO READ HER
IMMEDIATELY.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.815
- IT'S A BLONDE FILTERED
CIGARETTE.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.657
MERCHANTEUSE.
IT'S FRENCH.

13:49.690 --> 13:52.523
DESPEREAUX ALWAYS LEAVES ONE
BURNING AS HIS SIGNATURE.

13:52.560 --> 13:58.624
[indistinct chatter]

14:13.950 --> 14:15.941
DESPEREAUX ALWAYS COMES
IN AND OUT OF TOWN

14:15.980 --> 14:17.686
UNDETECT ED,
WITH AN ARMY OF ALIASES,

14:17.720 --> 14:18.812
USUALLY OF AN ARTIST.

14:18.850 --> 14:20.351
- PARDON ME!

14:20.390 --> 14:22.415
IF EVERYONE WOULD LIKE
TO ADJOURN TO THE ROOF,

14:22.460 --> 14:24.087
THE PSYCHIC CRIMINAL-CATCHING
PORTION OF THE DAY

14:24.130 --> 14:25.256
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

14:26.230 --> 14:28.596
- EVERYONE, JUST PLEASE
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

14:28.630 --> 14:29.858
HE DOES THIS ALL THE TIME.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.768
- MILDLY IMPRESSIVE
THAT YOU FOUND ME HERE.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.131
YOU TWO ARE MAKING
A MARKED IMPROVEMENT

14:41.180 --> 14:44.741
FROM YOUR HARLEQUINADE ANTICS
ON THE SLOPES.

14:44.780 --> 14:46.873
- IN MY DEFENSE,
I HAVE TWO LEFT KNEES.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.876
- YOU KNOW
WHAT'S MORE IMPRESSIVE?

14:48.920 --> 14:51.548
IN ABOUT 15 SECONDS,
YOU'RE GONNA SEE A FIERCE,

14:51.590 --> 14:53.649
ALBEIT GUNLESS,
AMERICAN DETECTIVE,

14:53.690 --> 14:55.681
HIS STRIKING
SNOW BUNNY PARTNER,

14:55.720 --> 14:57.449
WHICH I MEAN
NOTHING SALACIOUS BY,

14:57.490 --> 14:58.821
AND HALF THE R.C.M.P.

14:58.860 --> 15:02.023
ARE GONNA STORM THIS ROOF
AND TAKE YOU DOWN.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.823
WAIT FOR IT...

15:05.870 --> 15:07.167
- I'D LOVE TO.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.462
BUT I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.399
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

15:16.910 --> 15:18.502
- TO MY ROOM.

15:18.550 --> 15:22.714
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO WAIT FOR IT.

15:30.890 --> 15:34.394
- OKAY, CLEARLY,
THAT WAS MORE IMPRESSIVE.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.238
- [sighs] I AM TELLING YOU,
HE WAS HERE.

15:42.270 --> 15:43.601
HE WAS RIGHT HERE.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.437
- AND HE JUMPED OFF.
FROM A HANDSTAND!

15:45.470 --> 15:48.200
- IT--IT WASN'T FROM
A HANDSTAND, HE JUST--

15:48.240 --> 15:49.309
HE JUMPED OFF NORMAL STYLE.

15:49.340 --> 15:51.649
- HE JUMPED OFF
A 26-STORY BUILDING?

15:51.680 --> 15:53.113
- SIR, SOMEBODY WAS JUST SPOTTED

15:53.150 --> 15:54.549
COMING OUT
OF THE SERVICE ELEVATOR.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.047
- WE DIDN'T HAVE
A MAN DOWN THERE?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.547
- BECAUSE YOU ASKED EVERYONE
TO COME UP HERE.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.716
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF SHAWN.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.183
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S NOT HIM.

16:00.220 --> 16:03.155
WE JUST SAW DESPEREAUX
LEAP FROM THIS BUILDING!

16:03.190 --> 16:04.259
- HE WAS WEARING
A FLYING SUIT.

16:04.290 --> 16:06.520
- HE WA--
WE--WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.825
GUYS! ED.

16:09.860 --> 16:12.363
- LOOK, I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I BELIEVE YOU.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.369
COMPLETELY. EXCEPT FOR THE
JUMPING OFF THE BUILDING PART.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.539
- MACKINTOSH!

16:17.570 --> 16:18.867
- WE LOOKED LIKE IDIOTS.

16:18.910 --> 16:21.299
- GUS, WE HAVE TO REGROUP.
AND WE NEED TO EAT.

16:21.340 --> 16:24.207
- SHAWN, THIS PLACE SEEMS
A LITTLE--

16:24.250 --> 16:25.603
- EXCLUSIVE?
- DARK.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.777
COZY. ROMANTIC.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.572
A LITTLE SEXY.

16:29.620 --> 16:30.712
- FIRST OF ALL,
YOU SAY THOSE WORDS

16:30.750 --> 16:31.944
LIKE THEY'RE BAD THINGS.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.287
SECONDLY, DO YOU KNOW
HOW HARD IT IS

16:33.320 --> 16:34.480
TO GET A RESERVATION
AT THIS PLACE?

16:34.520 --> 16:36.249
YOU HAVE TO CALL, LIKE,
A MONTH IN ADVANCE.

16:36.290 --> 16:38.326
- YOU INVITED ME ON THIS TRIP
ON FRIDAY.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.622
WHEN DID YOU CALL?

16:39.660 --> 16:40.991
- IT'S IRRELEVANT.

16:41.030 --> 16:42.657
WHAT MATTERS...

16:42.700 --> 16:45.225
[whispering]
DUDE. DUDE! THERE HE IS.

16:45.270 --> 16:46.794
HE'S SITTING RIGHT THERE.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.161
WHAT DO WE DO?
DO WE CALL THE COPS?

16:48.200 --> 16:49.235
WHAT IF HE SEES US?

16:49.270 --> 16:50.703
- HE SEES US.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

16:50.740 --> 16:52.901
- HE'S WAVING US OVER.
- OH, MY GOSH, HE IS.

16:52.940 --> 16:55.135
- WE SHOULDN'T GO OVER THERE.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.249
WE FOUND YOU.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.941
SO...LOOKS LIKE WE WIN.

17:03.990 --> 17:07.357
- I AM NEITHER KNOWN NOR WANTED
IN THIS COUNTRY.

17:07.390 --> 17:08.948
AT BEST,
I'M A PERSON OF INTEREST

17:08.990 --> 17:10.787
IN THE PLACES
I DO MY WORK.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.479
SUCH IS THE CURSE
OF MY TALENT.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.788
MM.

17:15.830 --> 17:17.923
SO SINCE I HAVE TAKEN
THE TIME TO FIND YOU,

17:17.970 --> 17:20.188
PLEASE, DON'T SPOIL IT
WITH RUDENESS.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.889
HAVE A SEAT.

17:21.940 --> 17:23.032
- THANK YOU.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.004
- YOU KNOW, I'VE, UH--

17:27.040 --> 17:28.735
I'VE ENJOYED OUR SPARRING
SO FAR.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.442
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACES
WHEN I JUMPED FROM THAT BUILDING

17:31.480 --> 17:33.311
WAS, UH...AMUSING.

17:33.350 --> 17:36.649
BUT I'D BE REMISS
IF I DIDN'T INFORM YOU

17:36.680 --> 17:39.615
THAT YOU'RE
WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

17:39.650 --> 17:42.585
THE SIMPLE FACT IS,
YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME.

17:42.620 --> 17:45.919
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.849
WHICH MAKES WHAT SHOULD BE
AN EXCITING LIFE

17:48.900 --> 17:50.891
SOMEWHAT PEDESTRIAN.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.969
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.902
TO MAKE THIS MORE INTERESTING
FOR ME,

17:59.940 --> 18:03.307
I'M GOING TO WRITE DOWN
EVERYTHING THAT I'M GOING TO DO.

18:03.350 --> 18:06.478
SOMETIME TOMORROW,
I'M GOING TO STEAL A MANET.

18:06.510 --> 18:10.446
AND THEN I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU
LOOK FOOLISH AGAIN.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.812
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,
I'M GOING TO TREAT MYSELF

18:13.860 --> 18:15.851
LIKE A KING.

18:18.460 --> 18:20.451
- OKAY.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.650
HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

18:22.700 --> 18:26.363
FIRST, I'M GOING TO GET
SOME OF THAT MAPLE CANDY

18:26.400 --> 18:28.231
THAT EVERYBODY SEEMS
TO BE RAVING ABOUT.

18:28.270 --> 18:30.534
THEN I'M GOING TO PURCHASE
MYSELF A WALKING STICK.

18:30.570 --> 18:32.663
PREFERABLY SOMETHING
WITH A RAM'S HEAD

18:32.710 --> 18:34.109
CARVED INTO THE HANDLE.

18:34.140 --> 18:36.074
AND FINALLY, WE'RE GOING
TO CATCH OURSELVES

18:36.110 --> 18:37.372
AN INTERNATIONAL ART THIEF.

18:37.410 --> 18:39.799
I'M NOT SAYING FOR SURE
IT'S GOING TO BE YOU.

18:39.850 --> 18:42.273
BUT, UH, RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.

18:44.050 --> 18:46.746
- ARE YOU WRITING
ON OUR CLOTH NAPKINS?

18:46.790 --> 18:48.189
- LOOK, IT'S NOT MY FAULT,
OKAY?

18:48.220 --> 18:49.585
YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT
OF NOTEPAD SYSTEM,

18:49.620 --> 18:51.349
LIKE NEXT TO PAY PHONES,
THEY HAVE A LITTLE--

18:51.390 --> 18:52.948
A LITTLE PAD THAT YOU--

18:52.990 --> 18:55.197
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
ANYONE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT.

18:55.230 --> 18:57.460
UNLESS YOU'RE ANIMALS,
OF COURSE.

18:59.270 --> 19:00.532
- ANIMALS? WHOA.

19:00.570 --> 19:02.367
WHAT IS THAT?

19:02.400 --> 19:04.766
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

19:04.810 --> 19:05.959
- WHERE DID HE GO?

19:06.010 --> 19:07.170
HE DISAPPEARED AGAIN?

19:07.210 --> 19:09.576
- I BELIEVE SO.

19:09.610 --> 19:11.043
UNLESS HE'S HIDING
UNDER THE TABLE,

19:11.080 --> 19:13.139
IN WHICH CASE THIS CONVERSATION
WOULD BE EMBARRASSING.

19:13.180 --> 19:16.013
NO, I'M AFRAID WE FELL

19:16.050 --> 19:18.746
FOR THE FLAMING BAKED ALASKA
DIVERSION TRICK AGAIN.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.143
- SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

19:20.190 --> 19:21.953
YOU GONNA PRETEND LIKE YOU GOT
THE INFORMATION

19:21.990 --> 19:23.116
ABOUT THE MANET PSYCHICALLY?

19:23.160 --> 19:25.458
- PLEASE, GUS.
THAT'S CHEAP AND EASY.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.196
GIVE ME SOME CREDIT.

19:27.230 --> 19:30.154
WE DON'T KNOW WHY HE JUST HANDED
THIS INFORMATION OVER TO US.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.361
WE'LL DO WHAT ANY REASONABLE
DETECTIVE WOULD DO.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.389
- WHAT'S THAT?

19:33.440 --> 19:36.694
- I SEE A MAN...NET.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.264
YES.

19:38.310 --> 19:42.679
I SEE THE PAINTER
JOHN MANET.

19:42.710 --> 19:44.007
- EDOUARD.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.143
- WHERE IN TOWN
MIGHT ONE FIND AN--

19:46.180 --> 19:47.818
- EDOUARD MANET.
- WHAT HE SAID.

19:47.850 --> 19:49.442
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
THAT DESPEREAUX

19:49.480 --> 19:51.710
IS GOING TO TRY
AND STEAL ONE TONIGHT.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.218
- HOW CLEAR ARE YOU ON THIS?

19:54.260 --> 19:56.387
- IT'S AS IF HE WROTE IT
ON A PIECE OF PAPER

19:56.420 --> 19:58.285
AND PUT IT IN MY HAND.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.788
YOU SURE THIS
IS THE ONLY MANET?

20:03.830 --> 20:05.024
- YES.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.288
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE ONE
AT A GALLERY IN TOWN.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.228
I TOOK THE INITIATIVE
OF MAKING A BOOK

20:09.270 --> 20:11.363
OF ALL THE THINGS OF VALUE
THAT DESPEREAUX MIGHT HIT.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.037
I EVEN USED MY BIND-IT-ALL.

20:13.070 --> 20:14.731
NOT A MANET ON THE LIST.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.271
BUT THEN
YOUR GIRL DETECTIVE THERE,

20:17.310 --> 20:18.948
SHE DID A LITTLE MORE DIGGING
AND FOUND THIS.

20:18.980 --> 20:21.141
- THIS IS WILLIAM CHARLES
PULVER'S BOAT.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.340
- YACHT.

20:22.380 --> 20:23.779
- YACHT.

20:23.820 --> 20:26.345
HE'S A BILLIONAIRE.
- MILLIONAIRE.

20:26.390 --> 20:28.585
- OKAY, FORMER BILLIONAIRE,
NOW MILLIONAIRE,

20:28.620 --> 20:30.087
LIVING OFF OF HIS YACHT.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.156
HAS AN EXTENSIVE
ART COLLECTION.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.418
HE SAILED
INTO TOWN YESTERDAY.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.348
HE HAS A LATE-PERIOD MANET
HANGING OVER THE PIANO

20:35.400 --> 20:36.890
IN HIS STATE ROOM.

20:36.930 --> 20:39.421
- WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU WEARING?

20:39.470 --> 20:40.767
- WHAT? OH, I--

20:40.800 --> 20:43.906
- YOU LOOK LIKE JULIE CHRISTIE
IN DOCTOR ZHIVAGO.

20:43.940 --> 20:45.931
- I GET COLD, OKAY?

20:45.970 --> 20:47.528
I GREW UP
IN A SUBTROPICAL CLIMATE.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.002
- NO, I-I DIDN'T MEAN IT--

20:49.040 --> 20:52.601
I THINK IT'S, YOU KNOW,
I MEAN--I THINK IT LOOKS NICE.

20:52.650 --> 20:54.709
- SHAWN, WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

20:54.750 --> 20:56.775
WE CAN STILL TALK
AS FRIENDS.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.583
- I-I KNOW THAT.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.019
- ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T DO THIS.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.359
SPENCER, YOU'VE GOT TO FIND ME
A WEAPON OF SOME SORT.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.221
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A CANE
WITH A BLOW DART IN IT.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.249
IF THIS THING GOES DOWN
AND IT GETS UGLY--

21:05.290 --> 21:06.757
- WE'RE WAITING
FOR A SINGLE MAN

21:06.790 --> 21:08.018
TO ENTER AN EMPTY BOAT.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.948
- WHICH MAY REQUIRE
DEADLY FORCE.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.467
[scuffling]

21:13.840 --> 21:15.364
- SHAWN, I GOTTA PEE.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.129
- I TOLD YOU TO GO
BACK AT THE HOTEL.

21:17.170 --> 21:18.899
- I COULDN'T.
I GOT FREAKED OUT.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.373
THERE WERE ROSE PETALS
EVERYWHERE.

21:20.410 --> 21:21.536
ALL OVER THE TOILET.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.229
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?
IT'S WEIRD.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.498
- IT'S NOT WEIRD.
IT'S WONDERFUL.

21:25.550 --> 21:26.539
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

21:26.580 --> 21:28.013
- WHAT?

21:28.050 --> 21:29.608
- I SAW SOMETHING.
IT'S A SHADOW.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.584
- NO, IT'S NOT A SHADOW.
IT'S A PERSON.

21:31.620 --> 21:33.383
WHAT IS HE DOING OUT HERE?

21:33.420 --> 21:35.115
- HE'S DEFINITELY PACKING HEAT.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.355
- THAT MAKES ONE OF YOU.
- SHUT UP, GUSTER.

21:37.390 --> 21:38.550
- WELL, LET'S ALL
JUST THINK THIS THROUGH.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.058
- THERE IS A MAN AND A SHADOW
ON THE DOCK.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.091
REPEAT, A MAN AND A SHADOW
DOWN ON THE DOCK.

21:43.130 --> 21:44.461
- TELL THEM NOT TO APPROACH.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.626
- WELL, DON'T--
DON'T APPROACH.

21:45.670 --> 21:46.921
DON'T APPROACH THE MAN
OR THE SHADOW--

21:46.970 --> 21:49.336
- THEY'RE APPROACHING!
- OH, NO.

21:58.310 --> 21:59.709
- FALSE ALARM.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.173
IT IS A FALSE ALARM.
THIS IS NOT OUR PERP.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.711
EVERYBODY BACK TO--
- IT'S TOO LATE.

22:04.750 --> 22:08.254
HE TOOK IT ALREADY.

22:08.290 --> 22:11.327
THAT'S DEFINITELY
NOT A MANET.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.324
- SO HE PRETTY MUCH TOLD US
EXACTLY

22:16.360 --> 22:18.089
WHAT HE WAS
GOING TO STEAL,

22:18.130 --> 22:19.495
WHERE HE WAS GONNA
STEAL IT FROM,

22:19.530 --> 22:21.839
AND WHEN HE WAS GONNA BE THERE,
AND WE STILL COULDN'T CATCH HIM.

22:21.870 --> 22:23.462
I MEAN, HOW GOOD IS THIS GUY,
GUS?

22:23.510 --> 22:26.638
- SHAWN, WHY ARE WE ON
THIS CARRIAGE RIDE?

22:26.670 --> 22:29.400
YOU DON'T FIND IT
ODDLY ROMANTIC?

22:29.440 --> 22:31.169
- WHAT?
[scoffs]

22:31.210 --> 22:33.007
NO. NOT AT ALL.

22:33.050 --> 22:36.269
WHAT BETTER WAY
FOR A COUPLE BEST BUDDIES

22:36.320 --> 22:38.538
TO TAKE IN THE STARS,

22:40.620 --> 22:42.315
MAYBE SOLVE AN ART THEFT.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.952
- SO JUST LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU WANT ME TO HEAD

22:43.990 --> 22:45.218
TO THE KISSING BRIDGE.

22:47.290 --> 22:48.450
- WAIT A MINUTE.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.489
- WHAT?

22:49.530 --> 22:51.623
- WAIT A...

22:52.730 --> 22:55.164
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.360
THIS WHOLE THING.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.833
THE ROSE PETALS ON THE BED.

22:57.870 --> 22:59.303
THE RESERVATION
AT THE BISTRO.

22:59.340 --> 23:02.537
NOW THIS CARRIAGE RIDE.
THIS WHOLE TRIP.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.707
IT WAS ALL PLANNED AS A ROMANTIC
WEEK FOR YOU AND ABIGAIL.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.741
_ 1--

23:06.780 --> 23:09.317
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, I ADMIT IT.

23:09.350 --> 23:10.487
THE DATES FOR HER TEACHER'S
CONFERENCE

23:10.520 --> 23:11.782
CHANGED QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY.

23:11.820 --> 23:13.117
- THAT'S WHY YOU ASKED ME
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

23:13.150 --> 23:14.686
I WAS AN AFTERTHOUGHT?

23:14.720 --> 23:16.984
- GUS, DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN
THE MINUTIAE OF TRIP PLANNING.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.159
- THAT'S IT.
YOU DECEIVED ME, SHAWN.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.589
I'M DONE WITH THIS.
I'M FINISHED.

23:20.630 --> 23:22.495
- WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT DESPEREAUX'S NEXT MOVE IS.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.725
BESIDES, YOU DO NOT WANT
TO GET OUT OF THIS CARRIAGE.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.829
IT'S FREEZING.
IT'S DARK OUT HERE.

23:26.870 --> 23:28.735
AND THERE ARE MOST LIKELY
RACCOONS EVERYWHERE.

23:28.770 --> 23:31.204
- UH, I'M STAYING HERE.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.434
YOU ARE GETTING OUT.

23:32.470 --> 23:33.937
MY CREDIT CARD
PAID FOR THIS RIDE,

23:33.980 --> 23:36.039
AND I'M TAKING IT,
JUST NOT WITH YOU.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.968
BUT GOOD LUCK
FIGURING OUT THIS CASE.

23:38.010 --> 23:39.238
- GU--NO, GUS!
WHAT ARE YOU--

23:39.280 --> 23:42.716
STOP IT! NO...

23:42.750 --> 23:45.116
WHA--
AT LEAST LEAVE ME THE BLANKET!

23:45.150 --> 23:46.788
[panﬁng]

23:46.820 --> 23:49.789
HELLO, RACCOONS.

23:49.820 --> 23:51.356
I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING ME.

23:51.390 --> 23:52.584
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.188
I'D BE DOING THE SAME THING
IF I WAS YOU.

23:54.230 --> 23:55.299
I MEAN, WHO AM I?

23:55.330 --> 23:57.059
SOME MYSTERIOUS BIPED

23:57.100 --> 23:58.658
INFILTRATING
YOUR NATURAL HABITAT.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.463
I KNOW YOU DON'T MEAN
TO SCARE ME

24:00.500 --> 24:01.797
WITH YOUR BEADY LITTLE
YELLOW EYES

24:01.840 --> 24:03.330
THAT GLOW LIKE THE DEVIL.
[chuckles]

24:03.370 --> 24:07.238
LET'S DO A LIST--WE'LL DO
A LIST OF FAMOUS RACCOONS.

24:07.270 --> 24:10.171
MEEKO FROM POCAHONTAS.
CHECK.

24:10.210 --> 24:13.179
ROCKY RACCOON.

24:13.210 --> 24:16.441
JUDGES, GOOD READING
ON ROCKY RA...

24:19.250 --> 24:21.980
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

24:22.020 --> 24:23.419
- TO MY ROOM.

24:25.690 --> 24:27.692
- OKAY.

24:27.730 --> 24:32.019
OKAY, YOU LITTLE
MASKED NIGHT BANDITS.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.765
I GOTTA GO.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.689
I THINK I KNOW
WHERE DESPEREAUX IS.

24:36.740 --> 24:40.369
BUT YOU--BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY
NOT INTERESTED.

24:40.410 --> 24:41.832
WELL, IT'S...

24:41.880 --> 24:43.768
MAYBE A COUPLE OF YOU ARE.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.779
MORE SO THAN--
MORE SO THAN THE OTHERS.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.188
HELLO, BERTRAND.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.983
- YES, SIR.
HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

24:53.020 --> 24:54.749
- I SEEM TO HAVE MISPLACED
MY CARD KEY.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.655
- OH, WELL, I'D BE HAPPY
TO REPLACE YOUR KEY.

24:56.690 --> 24:58.089
I JUST NEED YOUR NAME.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.348
- PIERRE DESPEREAUX.

25:00.390 --> 25:04.963
- I'M SORRY, UH, THERE'S NO ONE
BY THAT NAME REGISTERED HERE.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.867
- DESPEREAUX ALWAYS COMES
IN AND OUT OF TOWN UNDETECTED

25:07.900 --> 25:09.936
WITH AN ARMY OF ALIASES,
USUALLY OF AN ARTIST.

25:09.970 --> 25:11.665
- UH, HERE'S THE THING.

25:11.710 --> 25:13.803
I REGISTER UNDER A LOT
OF DIFFERENT NAMES

25:13.840 --> 25:16.308
IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY PRIVACY,
SO WHY DON'T WE TRY

25:16.340 --> 25:18.808
JOHN VAN GOGH.

25:20.650 --> 25:24.939
NOTHING?
JACQUES HOCKN EYSTEIN?

25:26.090 --> 25:27.443
"STINE."

25:27.490 --> 25:30.050
- OKAY, UH, SIR, UM,

25:30.090 --> 25:31.887
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT SHENANIGANS

25:31.930 --> 25:34.023
YOU'RE UP TO,
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT,

25:34.060 --> 25:35.152
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE IT.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.997
- IT MIGHT'VE BEEN EDGAR DEGAS.

25:37.030 --> 25:38.668
12TH FLOOR.

25:42.770 --> 25:44.237
- WELL--YES, YES.

25:44.270 --> 25:46.568
THAT NAME IS HERE.

25:46.610 --> 25:48.430
UM, DO YOU THINK
I COULD GET A--

25:48.480 --> 25:49.731
- I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.

25:49.780 --> 25:51.645
IT'S MY ASSISTANT
THAT MAKES ALL THE RESERVATIONS.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.409
SHE'S BEEN UNDER
HEAW MEDICATION.

25:53.450 --> 25:54.644
SHE WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED
WITH PARVO.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.478
- WELL, ISN'T THAT
A DOG'S DISEASE?

25:57.520 --> 25:59.886
- YES. YES IT IS.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.285
MY ASSISTANT
IS A GOLDEN RETRIEVER.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.480
ADORABLE, BUT DIM.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.886
HER WHOLE KEYBOARD
IS JUST THREE BIG BUTTONS.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.659
SHE HAS VERAYHLARGE PAWS.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.056
SHOULD'VE FIRED HER YEARS AGO,
BUT SHE'S A RESCUE,

26:09.100 --> 26:11.227
AND I JUST DIDN'T HAVE
THE HEART.

26:13.430 --> 26:16.433
GUS, GUESS WHERE I AM
RIGHT NOW?

26:16.470 --> 26:18.506
I'M IN DESPEREAUX'S ROOM
RIGHT NOW.

26:18.540 --> 26:20.132
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.

26:20.170 --> 26:21.831
YEAH, I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA RIFLE
THROUGH ALL OF THIS STUFF,

26:21.880 --> 26:23.529
AND THEN I'M TOTALLY GONNA PULL
A JOHN TURTURRO

26:23.580 --> 26:24.706
FROM MILLER'S CROSSING ON HIM.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.240
AND THEN WE'LL GET SOME SUNDAES.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.874
I'M JUST GONNA SIT HERE QUIETLY,
WAIT FOR HIM TO GET BACK,

26:28.920 --> 26:30.114
AND THEN I'M GONNA
CLICK ON THE LAMP.

26:30.150 --> 26:31.549
SCARE THE GINGERSNAPS
OUT OF HIM.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.785
WHAT.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.754
NO, I DON'T REMEMBER
HOW THAT MOVIE ENDS, WHY?

26:35.790 --> 26:37.087
WHOA!

26:40.090 --> 26:41.853
THAT'S A "NEGATIVO"
ON THE SUNDAES, BUDDY.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.095
I REPEAT,
NEGATIVE ON THE SUNDAES.

26:44.130 --> 26:47.896
[laughter]

26:47.940 --> 26:49.999
SO. SO...

26:50.040 --> 26:52.031
THIS IS YOUR ROOM?
OKAY.

26:52.070 --> 26:53.606
THIS IS EMBARRASSING,
ISN'T IT?

26:53.640 --> 26:54.971
I MEAN, UH,

26:55.010 --> 26:56.932
IT'S A REAL RATTLESNAKE
OF A MISUNDERSTANDING.

26:56.980 --> 26:59.369
IT'S--IT'S AMAZING
HOW MUCH THIS PLACE LOOKS

26:59.410 --> 27:01.241
JUST LIKE THE ROOM
THAT GUS AND I HAVE

27:01.280 --> 27:03.646
OVER AT THE...
CAPTAIN VANCOUVER DO-RIGHT INN.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.317
- SIT.

27:06.450 --> 27:11.251
YOU KNOW, I NEVER WAS A FAN
OF MILLER'S CROSSING.

27:11.290 --> 27:13.019
TOO MUCH GORE AND VIOLENCE.

27:13.060 --> 27:15.096
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG,

27:15.130 --> 27:16.927
I APPRECIATE A GOOD MURDER.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.622
BUT WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE
SO MESSY?

27:19.670 --> 27:21.297
WHERE'S THE ELEGANCE?

27:21.340 --> 27:22.693
THE GRACE?

27:22.740 --> 27:26.767
PEOPLE DON'T KILL PEOPLE
WITH PANACHE ANYMORE.

27:26.810 --> 27:28.539
I WISH I COULD STAY
AND CHAT WITH YOU,

27:28.580 --> 27:32.038
BUT I'M ACTUALLY GETTING READY
TO PRESS ON.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.777
- THERE--THERE WOULDN'T
HAPPEN TO BE A MANET

27:35.820 --> 27:38.186
IN THAT SUITCASE
BY ANY CHANCE, WOULD THERE?

27:38.220 --> 27:39.539
- YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULD KEEP AT

27:39.590 --> 27:42.115
THIS DETECTIVE BUSINESS,
MR. SPENCER.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.084
YOU HAVE THE HAIR FOR IT,
AND THAT'S HALF THE BATTLE.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.098
WHAT?

27:48.130 --> 27:51.395
OH, YOU THOUGHT MY MARCO CICCONE
LOAFERS WERE A GUN?

27:51.430 --> 27:52.988
- MAYBE.

27:53.030 --> 27:54.258
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
MR. SPENCER.

27:56.840 --> 28:00.298
THIS IS MY GUN, YOU SEE?

28:00.340 --> 28:02.706
A GENTLEMAN OF LEISURE
NEVER PACKS HIS WEAPON

28:02.740 --> 28:04.071
NEXT TO HIS SOCKS.

28:04.110 --> 28:06.249
IT'S UNCOUTH.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.747
WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU?

28:07.780 --> 28:09.247
- NO?

28:09.280 --> 28:10.645
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.183
NOT YET, ANYWAY.

28:13.220 --> 28:15.381
I HAVE TO BE PUSHED VERY HARD

28:15.420 --> 28:17.615
TO GET INTO
THAT KIND OF BUSINESS.

28:17.660 --> 28:19.218
NUMBER ONE, IT'S MESSY.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.626
AND I HAVE TO SPEND
ONE MORE NIGHT HERE.

28:21.660 --> 28:25.391
NUMBER TWO, YOU HAVE NOTHING
ON ME BUT YOUR WORD.

28:25.430 --> 28:29.469
YOUR VERY SHAKY,
VERY SUSPECT WORD.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.298
THEREFORE, YOU POSE ABSOLUTELY
NO THREAT TO ME WHATSOEVER.

28:32.340 --> 28:35.935
I DO HAVE TO THANK YOU,
THOUGH.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.244
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL
FOR ME.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.645
- MY PLEASURE.
[nervous chuckle]

28:39.680 --> 28:41.648
- AND NOW,
IF YOU DON'T MIND--

28:41.680 --> 28:45.309
- OH, UH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO RESPOND.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.341
I'M BOTH RELIEVED
AND OFFENDED

28:47.390 --> 28:48.755
AT THE SAME TIME.

28:48.790 --> 28:51.759
BUT I KNOW WHEN I'M BEAT.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.329
ONE MORE THING.

28:58.370 --> 28:59.792
WHAT DAY IS TODAY?

28:59.830 --> 29:02.060
- SUNDAY.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.967
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

29:07.110 --> 29:09.032
- SPENCER, I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT ANYMORE.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.479
I AM TELLING YOU,
HE IS DONE.

29:10.510 --> 29:11.807
HE IS HEADING FOR THE BORDER.

29:11.850 --> 29:12.908
- LASSIE, LISTEN.

29:12.950 --> 29:14.315
IT'S NOT MOLSON TIME
JUST YET.

29:14.350 --> 29:15.817
I KNOW HE'S GOING TO STEAL
ONE MORE THING.

29:15.850 --> 29:16.874
- SO WHAT'S HE GOING TO STEAL?

29:16.920 --> 29:17.909
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WHERE IS IT, THEN?

29:17.950 --> 29:18.939
- I DON'T HAVE A COMPLETELY

29:18.990 --> 29:20.082
CLEAR PICTURE ON THAT,
BUT I AM HONING.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.087
I AM A HONER.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.509
- THERE IS A SMALL JET

29:23.560 --> 29:25.027
WAITING AT A PRIVATE AIRFIELD

29:25.060 --> 29:26.823
JUST OVER THE BORDER
IN BLAINE, WASHINGTON,

29:26.860 --> 29:28.691
REGISTERED TO ONE
OF HIS ALIASES.

29:28.730 --> 29:30.095
- BARRY PICASSO?
- NO.

29:30.130 --> 29:31.529
IT'S SCHEDULED TO TAKE OFF
IN FOUR HOURS.

29:31.570 --> 29:32.696
WE PLAN ON BEING THERE.

29:32.730 --> 29:33.890
- OKAY, LOOK, GUYS.
HERE'S THE THING.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.589
I ACTUALLY SPOKE WITH HIM
LAST NIGHT.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.359
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU SPOKE WITH HIM?

29:38.410 --> 29:41.607
- I MEAN I HAD A--A VISION,
WHEREIN WE--WE SPOKE.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.574
- SEE, HE--HE HAD A VISION.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.703
WHAT EXACTLY WAS HE DOING
IN THIS VISION?

29:45.750 --> 29:47.172
- PACKING.

29:47.210 --> 29:49.815
- OF COURSE HE WAS PACKING,
BECAUSE HE'S LEAVING TOWN!

29:49.850 --> 29:52.410
- WRONG, BECAUSE HE WANTED ME
TO THINK HE WAS LEAVING TOWN.

29:52.450 --> 29:53.815
IT WAS ALL A SHOW
FOR MY BENEFIT.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.384
THERE IS NO WAY THIS GUY
WOULD LEAVE TOWN

29:55.420 --> 29:56.512
WITH OUT HIS DRY CLEANING,
AND THAT

29:56.560 --> 29:58.221
DOES NOT GET DELIVERED
UNTIL TUESDAY.

29:58.260 --> 30:00.182
TRUST ME, HE CARES
JUST AS MUCH ABOUT HIS PANTS

30:00.230 --> 30:01.527
AS HE DOES ABOUT THIEVERY.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.926
- SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,
DESPEREAUX COMES TO YOU

30:03.970 --> 30:06.621
IN A VISION
TO FAKE DOING SOMETHING?

30:09.400 --> 30:11.834
- I DO HAVE TO THANK YOU,
THOUGH.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.838
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY USEFUL
FOR ME.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.976
- I WAS A SMOKESCREEN.

30:18.010 --> 30:20.808
HE USED ME AS A SMOKESCREEN.

30:20.850 --> 30:24.081
- I'M SORRY, SHAWN,
BUT THIS IS A REALLY GOOD LEAD.

30:25.590 --> 30:26.989
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, GUYS!

30:27.020 --> 30:29.352
DON'T YOU AT LEAST WANT
TO HEAR MY PLAN?

30:29.390 --> 30:31.824
IT COULD BE GOOD!
YOU DON'T KNOW.

30:34.230 --> 30:35.356
WHAT?

30:35.400 --> 30:39.564
[beeps]

30:39.600 --> 30:42.034
- I WANT TO SEE YOUR BOOK.
- MY BOOK?

30:42.070 --> 30:43.697
- YEAH, THE ONE WITH THINGS
THAT DESPEREAUX MIGHT STEAL.

30:43.740 --> 30:45.298
- NOBODY EVER WANTS
TO SEE MY BOOK.

30:45.340 --> 30:46.864
- I DO.
I WANT TO SEE THE BOOK.

30:46.910 --> 30:50.607
I'M ALSO GOING
TO EAT THESE WAFFLES.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.779
I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU,
MACKINTOSH.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.017
THE BINDING ON THIS THING
IS IMPRESSIVE.

30:55.050 --> 30:58.508
THE PRESENTATION, I MEAN--
JUST OUTSTANDING.

31:05.090 --> 31:08.253
- AND THEN THE NEXT DAY
I'M GOING TO TREAT MYSELF

31:08.300 --> 31:10.655
LIKE A KING.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.099
- HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

31:12.130 --> 31:13.165
[chuckles]

31:13.200 --> 31:14.792
THAT CLEVER BASTARD.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.762
- WHO?

31:16.800 --> 31:18.438
- WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT

31:18.470 --> 31:19.562
THE BUSCHLEN MOWATT GALLERY
IN YALETOWN?

31:19.610 --> 31:20.599
- WELL, I KNOW
QUITE A BIT, ACTUALLY.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.732
WHAT IN PARTICULAR?

31:21.780 --> 31:23.600
- IN PARTICULAR, UH,
THE SECURITY SYSTEM.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.005
- GOVERNMENT ISSUE.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.574
ACTUALLY, I WAS ON THE TEAM
THAT INSTALLED IT AND SET IT UP.

31:26.610 --> 31:28.578
- THAT'S FORTUITOUS.
CAN IT BE SET DOWN?

31:28.620 --> 31:30.247
- HUH?

31:30.280 --> 31:33.147
- I HAVE A SHOT AT REDEMPTION
FOR YOU.

31:33.190 --> 31:35.488
FOR RECOGNITION.
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DANGEROUS.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.953
AND WE'RE GONNA NEED GUS.
ARE YOU IN?

31:36.990 --> 31:38.457
WAIT BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.128
ARE YOU A FAN
OF SOLVING CRIMES?

31:43.660 --> 31:46.094
- YES.
- THAT'S MY MAN.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.703
- THAT'S HIM.
- THAT'S WHO?

31:59.750 --> 32:01.172
- THAT'S THE GALLERY OWNER.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.915
HE'S THE LAST ONE OUT.
THAT MEANS IT'S CLOSED.

32:02.950 --> 32:05.043
WE CAN GO INSIDE.
THAT'S WHERE THE CROWN IS.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.217
- THAT WAS YOUR PLAN, SHAWN?
TO STEAL THE CROWN?

32:07.250 --> 32:09.218
- [scoffs]
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.887
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

32:10.920 --> 32:13.286
POSSIBLY MOVE THE CROWN
AT BEST.

32:13.330 --> 32:15.798
BUT THE POINT IS TO GET
TO IT FIRST, BEFORE DESPEREAUX.

32:15.830 --> 32:18.219
- NOT ONLY IS THIS A FELONY
OF INTERNATIONAL PROPORTIONS,

32:18.270 --> 32:20.488
SHAWN, BUT ALSO,
WE ARE NOT ART THIEVES.

32:20.530 --> 32:23.237
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS IS FOR?

32:23.270 --> 32:24.339
BIG APPLE, COME IN.

32:24.370 --> 32:26.258
ARE WE GOOD TO GO?

32:26.310 --> 32:29.734
- UH, JUST ABOUT, SHAWN.
UH, OVER.

32:34.380 --> 32:36.041
- SEE, GUS?

32:36.080 --> 32:38.640
IT'S NOT REALLY BREAKING IN
IF THE ACTUAL COPS

32:38.690 --> 32:40.339
HELP YOU BREAK IN,
AM I RIGHT?

32:40.390 --> 32:42.358
- DO I NEED TO EXPLAIN THE LAW
TO YOU, SHAWN?

32:42.390 --> 32:44.028
- YOU CAN TRY, BUT...

32:44.060 --> 32:47.427
IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING
TO MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.

32:47.460 --> 32:51.089
- SO HOW DO YOU PLAN ON GETTING
THROUGH THIS OBSTACLE?

32:51.130 --> 32:54.736
- DUDE, I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN
ENTRAPMENT AT LEAST 26 TIMES.

32:54.770 --> 32:56.692
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

32:56.740 --> 32:58.833
YOU'RE TWICE AS LIMBER
AS C. ZETA-JONES.

32:58.870 --> 33:01.839
- UH-UH, SHAWN.
NOT HAPPENING.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.609
- GUS, WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS HERE.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.244
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE CAN TURN BACK.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.770
LOOK, IT'S THREE LASERS.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.744
PLUS, THEY'RE CANADIAN LASERS.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.975
I'M GONNA GUIDE YOU
THROUGH THIS.

33:11.020 --> 33:12.942
USAIN BOLT.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.649
- [whimper]

33:17.690 --> 33:18.952
GUS TO THE WORLD.

33:18.990 --> 33:21.458
- THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!

33:21.500 --> 33:23.821
YOU GOT THIS.

33:25.370 --> 33:26.598
THAT'S IT, BUDDY.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.269
NOW--NOW LOWER
YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER

33:29.300 --> 33:30.961
JUST A LITTLE BIT,
LIKE TWO INCHES.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.865
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S YOUR WAY IN.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.537
THAT'S YOUR WAY IN.
THAT'S YOUR GATEWAY.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.729
ARCH YOUR BACK.

33:35.780 --> 33:36.804
CLEAR.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.376
WATCH YOUR FEET,
WATCH YOUR FEET.

33:38.410 --> 33:39.707
OKAY, YOU'RE GOOD.

33:39.750 --> 33:42.241
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
THIS ONE'S A LITTLE TRICKIER.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.615
KNEE TO CHEST.
KNEE TO CHEST!

33:46.650 --> 33:49.187
NOW PIVOT ABOUT 30 DEGREES
TO YOUR LEFT.

33:49.220 --> 33:51.154
[exhales]
SAFE.

33:51.190 --> 33:52.851
DUDE, THAT'S YOUR SAFE HAVEN.

33:52.890 --> 33:53.879
THAT'S YOUR SAFE HAVEN.

33:53.930 --> 33:55.625
RIGHT HAND GREEN!

33:55.660 --> 33:57.025
RIGHT HAND GREEN!

33:57.060 --> 33:59.528
- THAT'S TWISTER, SHAWN.
- OH, YEAH.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.435
HOW COME
WE DON'T PLAY THAT ANYMORE?

34:01.470 --> 34:03.358
GET YOUR BUTT HIGHER!
ARCH YOUR BACK!

34:03.400 --> 34:05.300
SPREAD YOUR CHEEKS
IF YOU CAN.

34:05.340 --> 34:07.308
SCRATCH THAT.

34:07.340 --> 34:08.739
ABORT CHEEK SPREADING.

34:08.780 --> 34:09.906
PIVOT.

34:09.940 --> 34:11.407
PIVOT YOUR BODY
ABOUT 30 DEGREES.

34:11.450 --> 34:13.304
LEFT, TO THE LEFT.

34:13.350 --> 34:15.511
BOOM. BUT--WHAT?

34:15.550 --> 34:18.348
- [panting]

34:22.490 --> 34:23.514
- OH, BUDDY,

34:23.560 --> 34:25.255
I HAD MACKINTOSH
DISARM THE LASERS TOO.

34:25.290 --> 34:26.882
BUT I WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WOULD DO IT.

34:26.930 --> 34:29.296
NOW WE KNOW FOR THE FUTURE
THAT IF WE EVER

34:29.330 --> 34:30.456
ENCOUNTER THIS EXACT SCENARIO,

34:30.500 --> 34:32.593
OH, YOU ARE
THE MAN FOR THE JOB.

34:32.630 --> 34:34.234
WHAT?

34:35.340 --> 34:37.228
THERE IT IS.

34:43.780 --> 34:45.247
- WHERE'S THE CROWN?

34:45.280 --> 34:46.474
- IT'S IN THAT METAL BOX.

34:46.510 --> 34:47.909
IT CLOSES
WHEN THE GALLERY DOES.

34:47.950 --> 34:50.919
DON'T WORRY,
MACKINTOSH DISARM ED THIS TOO.

34:50.950 --> 34:53.783
THIS, MY FRIEND,
IS THE EASY PART.

34:55.220 --> 34:56.983
[alarms blaring]

34:57.020 --> 34:58.885
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THIS WAS THE EASY PART.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.056
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
THE EASY PART!

35:00.090 --> 35:01.523
DON'T I GET ANY CREDIT

35:01.560 --> 35:03.551
FOR PLANNING THIS WHOLE THING
IN, LIKE, LESS THAN TWO HOURS?

35:03.600 --> 35:04.760
- NO, YOU DON'T GET ANY CREDIT!

35:05.970 --> 35:07.961
- THEY WILL NOT.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.060
MAN, STOP PLAYING.
THERE'S NOBODY BEHIND ME.

35:11.100 --> 35:12.863
- SHUT UP, SHAWN.
- I'M NOT TURNING AROUND.

35:12.910 --> 35:14.275
[guns cocking]

35:22.050 --> 35:25.213
- DAD!
THEY ARRESTED YOU TOO?

35:25.250 --> 35:27.718
- I POSTED YOUR BAIL, SHAWN.
IT WAS MORE THAN I EXPECTED.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.479
YOU OWE ME THE DIFFERENCE
PLUS THE EXCHANGE RATE.

35:29.520 --> 35:30.612
LET'S GO.

35:30.660 --> 35:31.957
DO YOU REALIZE
THEY CHARGED ME NINE BUCKS

35:31.990 --> 35:33.150
FOR AN US MAGAZINE?

35:33.190 --> 35:34.498
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
- DAD, YOU DIDN'T BAIL OUT GUS?

35:34.530 --> 35:36.395
- NOW I GOTTA BAIL BOTH
OF YOU OUT? WHERE'S YOUR DAD?

35:36.430 --> 35:39.422
- SHAWN USED MY ONE CALL
TO VOTE FOR AMERICAN IDOL.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.768
- SHAWN, YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT GUS.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.028
I THOUGHT HE HAD HIS OWN CASH.

35:43.070 --> 35:44.207
DON'T YOU HAVE A CREDIT CARD?

35:44.240 --> 35:45.332
- MY CREDIT CARD
IS MAXED OUT.

35:45.370 --> 35:46.735
- DAD, BELIEVE ME,
I'VE SPOKEN TO HIM

35:46.770 --> 35:47.862
ABOUT NOT OVEREXTENDING HIMSELF.

35:47.910 --> 35:49.002
- SHAWN, DO YOU REALLY THINK
THIS IS FUN?

35:49.040 --> 35:50.405
- WELL, STANLEY PARK
WAS NICE.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.169
- YOU DO REALIZE
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THIS COUNTRY?

35:52.210 --> 35:54.519
- DAD, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
WE HAD HIM.

35:54.550 --> 35:56.973
BUT--
- BUT WHAT, SHAWN?

35:57.020 --> 35:59.409
- HE WAS TOO GOOD.
- TOO GOOD?

35:59.450 --> 36:00.712
WHAT'D I RAISE YOU TO DO?

36:00.750 --> 36:02.684
- IT WAS LITERALLY
THE PERFECT CRIME.

36:02.720 --> 36:03.812
- THE PERFECT CRIME?

36:03.860 --> 36:05.350
THERE IS NO SUCH THING

36:05.390 --> 36:06.857
AS A PERFECT CRIME, SHAWN.
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, FINE.

36:06.890 --> 36:08.858
WELL THEN, IT WAS AS CLOSE
AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.390
IT WAS THIS CLOSE.
- THE ONLY WAY IT'S CLOSE

36:10.430 --> 36:12.569
IS IF YOU MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE THE PERFECT CRIME.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.239
NOW, I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN
PUT GUS ON MY CREDIT CARD.

36:15.270 --> 36:16.828
IN THE MEANTIME,
I GOT A 4:00 SALMON BOAT,

36:16.870 --> 36:20.328
AND IF I MISS THAT,
THIS TRIP IS A COMPLETE WASTE.

36:26.410 --> 36:28.048
- BIG APPLE.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.570
WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT HAPPENED?

36:29.620 --> 36:31.383
- FIRED.
- WHY?

36:31.420 --> 36:32.512
- REALLY?

36:32.550 --> 36:34.950
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED
DOWN AT THE MUSEUM.

36:36.490 --> 36:38.651
I FEEL LIKE THIS
IS PARTIALLY MY FAULT.

36:38.690 --> 36:40.089
- PARTIALLY?
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

36:40.130 --> 36:42.792
- WELL, IT PROBABLY WOULD'VE
JUST BEEN A SUSPENSION,

36:42.830 --> 36:44.127
BUT THEN THE CROWN ENDED UP
GOING MISSING, SO...

36:44.160 --> 36:45.161
- SAY WHAT?

36:45.200 --> 36:46.827
- YOU KNOW?

36:46.870 --> 36:49.168
IT WAS GONE.
WHEN THEY OPENED THE CASE.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.667
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.134
- NO, WHEN THEY OPENED
THE METAL DISPLAY CASE,

36:53.170 --> 36:54.273
THE CROWN WAS MISSING.

36:54.310 --> 36:55.971
- WHERE'S THE CROWN?

36:56.010 --> 36:56.977
- IT'S IN THAT METAL BOX.

36:57.010 --> 36:58.170
IT CLOSES
WHEN THE GALLERY DOES.

36:58.210 --> 37:00.371
DUDE, WE WATCHED
THE MUSEUM CLOSE.

37:00.410 --> 37:02.378
WE--WE WATCHED THE THING CLOSE.
WE NEVER LEFT THE BUILDING.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.479
THE ONLY WAY
HE COULD'VE TAKEN IT IS IF...

37:04.520 --> 37:05.782
- HOW?

37:05.820 --> 37:08.118
- IS IF HE HAD HAD IT
ALL ALONG.

37:11.220 --> 37:12.380
OH.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.867
- I SOLD THAT PAINTING
TWO WEEKS AGO.

37:18.900 --> 37:21.061
- HE'S A BILLIONAIRE.
- MILLIONAIRE.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.965
- OKAY, FORMER BILLIONAIRE,
NOW MILLIONAIRE,

37:23.000 --> 37:24.194
LIVING OFF HIS YACHT.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.368
- OH, I KNOW WHY DESPEREAUX
NEVER GETS CAUGHT!

37:27.410 --> 37:30.538
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T STEAL
ANYTHING!

37:30.580 --> 37:33.208
WE GOTTA HURRY.
- THAT'S MY HELMET.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.811
I...OH...GUYS.

37:46.330 --> 37:49.299
- MR. SPENCER.

37:49.330 --> 37:51.298
YOU HAVE
AN IMPRESSIVE LEARNING CURVE.

37:51.330 --> 37:52.968
- THANK YOU.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.695
I ALSO PLAY THE MANDOCELLO.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.037
NOT WELL.

37:56.070 --> 37:58.709
BUT WHO ELSE DO YOU KNOW
WHO PLAYS THE MANDOCELLO?

37:58.740 --> 38:00.367
- I'M NO LONGER AMUSED.

38:00.410 --> 38:01.434
- YOU ALMOST HAD ME.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.277
I MEAN, THE YACHT
AND THE HIGH RISE

38:03.310 --> 38:04.971
WERE JUST FLAWLESS.

38:05.010 --> 38:07.444
BUT YOU LEFT ME TOO MUCH TIME
WHEN YOU STOLE THE CROWN.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.311
AND I COVERED ALL MY BASES.

38:09.350 --> 38:11.887
WHICH MEANS YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO STEAL THE CROWN.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.138
BUT THEN,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO,

38:14.190 --> 38:16.408
BECAUSE THE OWNER
JUST HANDED IT TO YOU.

38:16.460 --> 38:19.156
- I KNEW YOU WERE WORTHY.
- WORTHY.

38:19.190 --> 38:21.920
AND VERY DISAPPOINTED.
- REALLY, SHAWN?

38:21.960 --> 38:24.292
I'VE BEEN HIDING BACK HERE
FOR TEN MINUTES.

38:24.330 --> 38:25.729
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
GIVE YOUR SPEECH

38:25.770 --> 38:27.089
FROM INSIDE THE PLANE.
- GUS.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.768
- WHAT?
I'M SERIOUSLY CRAMPED BACK HERE.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.336
- I'M ABOUT TO DROP THE HAMMER
ON THIS GUY.

38:30.370 --> 38:32.361
JUST FLAG DOWN THE STEWARDESS.
ORDER A MOJITO.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.833
- JUST CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.007
- MAN, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SO COOL.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.678
BUT YOU'RE JUST HERE
TO LOOK THE PART.

38:38.710 --> 38:40.371
THIS WHOLE TIME,
I'M THINKING,

38:40.410 --> 38:42.776
"THIS GUY IS THOMAS CROWN."

38:42.820 --> 38:45.038
YOU'RE BARELY REMINGTON STEELE.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.785
WHICH MAKES ME, WHAT,
LAURA HOLT?

38:46.820 --> 38:50.415
YOU THINK A GUY LIKE ME
WANTS TO BE STEPHANIE ZIMBALIST?

38:50.460 --> 38:52.519
MAYBE.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.925
[inhales]

38:53.960 --> 38:56.827
THE ITEMS WERE HANDED TO YOU
ONE BY ONE.

38:56.860 --> 38:58.122
- THAT'S HIM.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.991
- THAT'S WHO?
- THAT'S THE GALLERY OWNER.

39:00.030 --> 39:01.019
HE'S THE LAST ONE OUT.

39:01.070 --> 39:02.298
THE GALLERY OWNER
HAD THE CROWN

39:02.340 --> 39:03.398
WHEN HE LEFT THE GALLERY.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.328
HE WAS HAVING MONEY TROUBLES.

39:05.370 --> 39:06.906
AS DID THE REST OF YOUR VICTIMS.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.704
AND YOU--
YOU'RE JUST THE MIDDLEMAN.

39:09.740 --> 39:12.538
YOU MADE IT LOOK LIKE THE ITEMS
WERE BEING STOLEN.

39:12.580 --> 39:15.515
HENCE YOUR CALLING CARD.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.017
AND ALWAYS IN A SERIES, RIGHT?

39:17.050 --> 39:19.780
SO IT WOULDN'T CALL SUSPICION
TO AN OWNER IN FINANCIAL PERIL

39:19.820 --> 39:23.551
WHO SUDDENLY GETS
HIS MANET STOLEN?

39:23.590 --> 39:24.682
INSURANCE FRAUD.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.290
REALLY?
THAT IS SO LAME.

39:27.330 --> 39:29.195
I MEAN, DO YOU EVEN HAVE
A PILOT'S LICENSE?

39:29.230 --> 39:30.857
-IDO.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.892
BUT NOW I FEEL AS THOUGH
I HAVE TO HURT YOU,

39:33.930 --> 39:35.488
WHICH SADDENS ME.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.690
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A MASTER CRIMINAL.

39:37.740 --> 39:39.264
- THE GENIUS OF MY PLAN

39:39.310 --> 39:41.574
IS IN ITS SIMPLICITY.

39:41.610 --> 39:45.501
PERHAPS IT'S NOT AS SEXY
AS YOU BELIEVED.

39:45.550 --> 39:49.145
BUT DON'T FORGET,
I GOT AWAY WITH IT.

39:49.180 --> 39:51.239
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

39:52.620 --> 39:53.712
- HELLO, DESPEREAUX.

39:53.750 --> 39:55.058
- [grunts]

39:55.090 --> 39:56.512
- BET YOU'RE NOT TOO HAPPY

39:56.560 --> 39:58.118
TO SEE ME RIGHT ABOUT NOW,
ARE YOU?

39:59.830 --> 40:03.994
- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHO YOU ARE.

40:04.030 --> 40:05.190
DETECTIVE.

40:05.230 --> 40:07.562
THANK YOU.

40:13.170 --> 40:15.104
- YOUR BOSS IS REALLY GOOD.

40:15.140 --> 40:17.108
- WE DO NOT WORK FOR HIM.

40:17.140 --> 40:19.142
- IT JUST SEEMS THAT WAY
SOMETIMES.

40:19.180 --> 40:21.910
- MR. SPENCER.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.645
I'VE OFTEN FANTASIZED

40:23.680 --> 40:25.545
ABOUT ESCAPING FROM PRISON,
YOU KNOW.

40:33.190 --> 40:34.498
- SHAWN.
- YES?

40:34.530 --> 40:36.851
- DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ODD
THAT YOU'RE

40:36.900 --> 40:39.926
IN A RELATIONSHIP NOW,
YET YOU INVITE ME

40:39.970 --> 40:42.768
TO MAYBE THE MOST ROMANTIC PLACE
ON EARTH?

40:42.800 --> 40:43.835
- OKAY, LOOK.
JULES, LISTEN.

40:43.870 --> 40:45.963
I-I MADE THESE PLANS
WEEKS AGO.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.638
AND GUS REFUSED TO COME
ON ACCOUNT HE'S A MAN.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.807
AND I'M A MAN.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.398
OR SOME NONSENSE LIKE THAT.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.645
LOOK, I HAVE A POINT.
IT'S THIS.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.910
I REFUSE TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
AROUND YOU.

40:56.950 --> 40:59.111
IT'S SILLY.
YOU MEAN TOO MUCH TO ME.

40:59.150 --> 41:02.654
AND--AND I AM PERFECT LY CAPABLE
OF KEEPING THIS PLATONIC

41:02.690 --> 41:03.782
AS LONG AS YOU ARE.

41:03.820 --> 41:05.378
- OH, PLEASE. I CAN.

41:05.430 --> 41:06.488
- WELL, I CAN TOO.

41:06.530 --> 41:09.124
- GREAT.
[laughs]

41:09.160 --> 41:10.718
- [softly] BUT HOW?

41:10.760 --> 41:12.261
- SO AT LEAST SHOW ME

41:12.300 --> 41:14.564
WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED
FOR THIS PERFECT DATE.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.239
- OKAY, BUT PROMISE
NOT TO LAUGH.

41:17.270 --> 41:20.535
- [singing opera in Italian]

41:20.570 --> 41:21.878
- YOU HIRED THIS GUY?

41:21.910 --> 41:23.434
- TECHNICALLY, GUS DID.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.209
WOULD'VE LOST OUR DEPOSIT.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.377
I DON'T--HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
MORE DISCREET.

41:27.410 --> 41:30.413
- [singing continues]

41:36.990 --> 41:38.309
- THIS IS OVERKILL, HUH?

41:38.360 --> 41:40.328
- NO, NO.
NOT IF YOU'RE SIX.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.896
- HEH.

41:41.930 --> 41:43.795
- A MIME, THOUGH?
REALLY, SHAWN?

41:43.830 --> 41:46.264
I DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T REALLY
STRIKE ME AS A MIME GUY.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.325
- OH, NO, NO, NO--THE MIME
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

41:48.370 --> 41:51.259
THIS MIME IS CLEARLY
WORKING ON HIS OWN.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.699
YOU SEEN ENOUGH?
- MORE THAN.

41:52.740 --> 41:54.731
- [clears throat]

41:54.780 --> 41:56.475
- SO ABIGAIL'S INTO OPERA, HUH?

41:56.510 --> 41:59.547
- NO, NOT REALLY.
JUST ROBUST ITALIAN MEN.

41:59.580 --> 42:02.617
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE SANG,
ACTUALLY.

42:02.650 --> 42:04.811
LOOK AT THAT BRIDGE.
- YEAH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

42:04.850 --> 42:07.819
- LITTLE-KNOWN FACT:
THAT BRIDGE WAS BUILT BY WOLVES.

42:07.850 --> 42:09.215
- REALLY?
