So you've been lying to me.

- You're lying to me now, aren't you?
- No, I ain't.

06:11.470 --> 06:14.869
When you came to Bow Street and asked
me to look after you, Billy sent you

06:14.870 --> 06:18.829
- so you could spy on me.
- That's not true, I swear it.

06:28.895 --> 06:32.109
Then why did you insist on coming
back from the hospital?

06:32.110 --> 06:36.229
You'd just lost a child. Anyone else
would've been glad of a place there,

06:36.230 --> 06:39.753
but not you. You had instructions
from Billy to come back here.

06:39.754 --> 06:41.287
What are you talking about?

06:48.122 --> 06:50.909

- He lied.
- Why would he?

07:01.697 --> 07:04.351
I don't know.
He said I'd be better off with you.

07:04.352 --> 07:06.435
Ask him yourself
if you don't believe me.

07:06.436 --> 07:10.157
- And chose your word over his?
- I begged him to let me stay.

07:10.158 --> 07:13.216
He wouldn't. He made his
servant bring me back.

I ain't lying.

Lloris the monster...

07:31.770 --> 07:33.730
Is it possible?

07:40.850 --> 07:42.849
That thing

07:42.850 --> 07:45.169
crawled to the river

07:45.170 --> 07:47.410

07:59.690 --> 08:01.270

08:01.271 --> 08:03.826
If that's where he took
Alice and the others,

08:03.827 --> 08:06.249
it'd explain
why he didn't want you there.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.824
He couldn't kill you without drawing
attention to himself

08:08.825 --> 08:13.809

was at an end.

from this marriage,

21:50.167 --> 21:52.977
The most elaborate delusion, Hervey.
You were quite right.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.086
Not unprecedented at this stage.

21:56.087 --> 22:00.526
The patient misconstrues his doctor
as the source of all his agony.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.806
I'll kill you, Hervey!

22:02.807 --> 22:04.567
Damn you!

22:12.407 --> 22:16.166
I would like to continue his
treatment on a charitable basis.

22:16.167 --> 22:19.646
Have someone qualified
certify him legally insane

22:19.647 --> 22:23.886
and it would save us both
the embarrassment of a public trial.

22:23.887 --> 22:27.366
That is a generous offer.
Thank you, Hervey,

22:27.367 --> 22:31.807
but, er, I think the law
needs to take its course.

22:32.727 --> 22:36.326
I will make arrangements
for a trial in-camera

22:36.327 --> 22:38.327
here in Bow Street.

22:39.127 --> 22:42.646
No public gallery...
and no journalists.

22:42.647 --> 22:44.927
There's a child!

22:48.527 --> 22:52.166
His manservant kept her
on his estate, but she escaped.

22:52.167 --> 22:56.007
She may be still alive. Find her
and she'll corroborate my story.

22:57.886 --> 22:59.885
- Her name?
- Alice Evans.

23:00.167 --> 23:02.647
And where might we find her?

23:05.207 --> 23:08.406
Not in his hearing.
Over here, I'll tell you.

23:08.407 --> 23:11.447
I would advise against that.

23:15.339 --> 23:16.899
Sir.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.407
I'm sorry, Marlott.

23:39.087 --> 23:42.967
Tell us what happened on
the morning of Tuesday, 21st of April.

23:43.807 --> 23:46.887
I went to his lodgings
to go and fetch Flora,

23:48.007 --> 23:50.006
the girl, sir.

23:50.007 --> 23:52.046
Why?

23:52.047 --> 23:54.287
We were to be married.

23:55.567 --> 23:58.926
She lodged with him,
he didn't want her to leave.

23:58.927 --> 24:02.926
- I was worried for her so I insisted.
- Why were you worried?

24:02.927 --> 24:05.447
His behaviour, sir.

24:07.527 --> 24:09.687
What of it?

24:11.846 --> 24:14.487
He was deranged, sir.

24:15.007 --> 24:17.327
What happened then?

24:18.887 --> 24:21.007
There was no answer at the door.

24:22.723 --> 24:24.686
I could see someone
through the window.

24:24.687 --> 24:27.727
I became anxious
for the girl's safety,

24:29.127 --> 24:31.287
so I opened the door and that's...

24:37.367 --> 24:38.869
that's when I saw it.

24:40.220 --> 24:41.847
Saw what?

24:48.167 --> 24:50.646
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

24:50.647 --> 24:51.751
She...

24:53.247 --> 24:55.367
She was lying there, sir,

24:57.287 --> 24:58.932
her throat cut.

25:04.487 --> 25:07.761
He was there,
standing in front of her,

25:08.791 --> 25:10.447
blood all over him

25:11.807 --> 25:14.087
and the murder weapon in his hand.

25:25.447 --> 25:27.687
No more questions, Your Honour.

25:28.811 --> 25:30.015
Thank you.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.007
Mr Nightingale, you may step down.

25:36.767 --> 25:38.966
No further witnesses, Your Honour.

25:38.967 --> 25:42.206
No witnesses for the defence,
Your Honour.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.055
Do you wish to submit
any mitigating evidence?

25:45.487 --> 25:50.166
The accused has been diagnosed
with advanced venereal disease

25:50.167 --> 25:53.206
and is clearly
not in full possession

25:53.207 --> 25:56.126
of his moral and mental faculties.

25:56.782 --> 26:00.206
We therefore ask for the dismissal
of all charges on medical grounds.

26:00.207 --> 26:04.606
Thank you, Mr Cusworth.
Your request for humane dismissal

26:04.607 --> 26:06.285
is denied.

26:07.407 --> 26:11.206
Since no mitigating evidence
has been submitted,

26:11.207 --> 26:14.486
and no witnesses for the defence
brought forward,

26:14.487 --> 26:18.886
you have no choice but to find
the defendant guilty as charged.

26:18.887 --> 26:22.767
I will therefore proceed
directly to sentencing.

26:31.127 --> 26:33.606
John Marlott,

26:34.296 --> 26:38.286
you have been found guilty
of the charge of wilful murder

26:38.287 --> 26:41.246
and are to be taken
from this courtroom

26:41.247 --> 26:43.806
to a place of execution

hanged by the neck

how it deranges the senses.
