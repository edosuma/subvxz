00:01.502 --> 00:04.671
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.755 --> 00:08.300
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.383 --> 00:11.595
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.678 --> 00:14.389
On which we used to rely?

00:14.473 --> 00:17.726
Lucky there's a family guy

00:17.809 --> 00:21.480
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.563 --> 00:23.232
All the things
that make us

00:23.315 --> 00:24.608
Laugh and cry

00:24.691 --> 00:29.821
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:33.909 --> 00:36.119
Guys, this is the best
dirty bookstore in town.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.538
Family owned,
great hours,

00:37.621 --> 00:38.872
and lots of parking
in the rear.

00:38.956 --> 00:39.957
Get it?

00:40.123 --> 00:42.251
Giggity, Giggity,
Giggity, Gig-gig-gig-gig!

00:42.334 --> 00:44.461
Wow. You usually expect
these places to be dirty.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.754
No, it's pretty clean.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.048
Carol Burnett works
part time as a janitor.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.847
You know, when she tugged her ear
at the end of that show,

00:54.930 --> 00:57.266
she was really saying
good night to her mom.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.352
(chuckling) I wonder what she tugged
to say good night to her dad.

01:00.435 --> 01:04.189
Oh! Giggity,
(scatting) Goo.

01:04.273 --> 01:05.899
What you staring at, Joe?

01:05.983 --> 01:10.696
These dolls all look
really surprised for some reason.

01:10.779 --> 01:14.783
I wonder
what they're all so surprised about.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.703
(yelling) What? You never seen
a handicapped man before?

01:17.786 --> 01:20.581
They're polyurethane
sex toys, Joe.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.708
They're not capable
of judgment.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.710
And even if they were,
who cares?

01:24.793 --> 01:26.253
They're whores.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.130
Wow, an old-time penny show.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.507
"The Naughty Flapper Girl."

01:30.591 --> 01:32.801
Oh, hot! She's voting!

01:34.511 --> 01:36.430
Yeah. You break
all the rules, eh?

01:36.513 --> 01:39.600
Yeah, that's right.
Vote for Taft, you dirty girl.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.977
Hey, Quagmire.
What's through that door?

01:42.060 --> 01:43.395
Oh, that's the exit.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.480
Of course, in this place
every exit's also an entrance.

01:45.564 --> 01:49.234
Giggity, Giggity, Giggity, Goo.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.945
Make 'em laugh,
make 'em laugh

01:52.029 --> 01:55.449
Don't you know
all the world loves to laugh

01:55.532 --> 01:58.160
I always try and find
the hottest chick in the place

01:58.243 --> 02:01.622
I crack her on the noggin
with a lamp or a vase

02:01.705 --> 02:04.458
And then when she's unconscious
I do stuff to her face

02:04.541 --> 02:07.711
Make 'em laugh,
make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh

02:12.466 --> 02:15.260
Meg, I need you
to baby-sit Stewie tomorrow afternoon.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.013
Mom, you know
I go to the mall on Saturdays.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.473
I mean,
I do have a life.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.391
Hey, what time is it?
We're gonna miss the movie.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.727
Yeah. Let's go, everyone.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.732
(sniffing)

02:37.574 --> 02:38.992
Hey. Hey!

02:39.076 --> 02:40.118
(hissing)

02:41.787 --> 02:43.705
Wow, Peter!
That's a book, isn't it?

02:43.789 --> 02:45.707
That's the first time
I've seen you reading something

02:45.791 --> 02:47.376
that didn't later
turn out to just be a sandwich.

02:47.459 --> 02:50.087
Yeah. It's an erotic book.
I bought it at that sex shop.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.880
I got to tell you though,
I've read four chapters

02:51.964 --> 02:53.632
of this, and it's not
sexy at all.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.635
"Much Ado About Humping."
Well, sounds sexy.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.053
Peter,
would you put that away?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.222
I don't like you
reading smut at the table.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.182
Yeah.
If only this were smut, Lois.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.726
"He rubbed
her shoulder sensually."

03:04.810 --> 03:06.645
What the hell is that?
That's not sexy.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.397
You can't do somebody
in the shoulder.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.566
Why don't you
and that book get a room?

03:10.649 --> 03:11.817
Did you hear
what I said, Brian?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.318
I said-- I said,
"Why don't you and that--"

03:13.402 --> 03:14.653
"That book get a room."
Yeah.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.113
Okay. I just want to
make sure you heard.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.411
Hey, guys.
Tell me if this letter sounds all right.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.079
"Dear Reek Publishing,

03:24.162 --> 03:26.915
"I was highly disappointed
by your erotic novel.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.542
"Here's what I
would have wrote.

03:28.625 --> 03:32.588
"'It was past midnight when the blonde,
smoking-hot lab assistant,

03:32.671 --> 03:36.425
"'who looked a little like Heather
Locklear, only with bigger jugs,

03:36.508 --> 03:39.094
"'was grabbed and thrown
onto the lab table.

03:39.178 --> 03:43.849
"'He ripped off her lab coat
and she grabbed his metallic extension.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.435
"'Oh. Did I mention
he was a robot?

03:46.518 --> 03:48.270
"'Cause that's
kind of important.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.106
"'Yeah, a robot. Awesome.'"

03:51.190 --> 03:53.942
Whoa! That is hot.
I got to get a copy of that.

03:54.026 --> 03:56.361
Yeah. You got some
serious talent there, Peter.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.114
Really?
I'm no school administrator,

03:59.198 --> 04:03.160
but there's an extension program
going on in my trousers.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.207
"And then
Captain Leroy Hot Dog

04:08.290 --> 04:10.167
"Zanzibar and Gina
from my work

04:10.250 --> 04:12.794
"got in the backseat
of his really cool spaceship.

04:12.878 --> 04:16.965
"Gina was finally wearing that tank top
I got her and nothing else.

04:17.049 --> 04:19.468
"Zanzibar knew
he couldn't control

04:19.551 --> 04:21.762
"his space horniness

04:21.845 --> 04:23.639
"and then
they totally did it.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.933
"And if I'd have been there,
I would have been, like,

04:26.016 --> 04:28.685
"'Oh, sweet.'"
Huh? What do you think?

04:28.769 --> 04:31.104
You certainly do
paint a picture, Peter.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.524
I felt like
I was right there on Planet Niptune.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.192
You're not the only one.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.777
Everyone down at the bar
wanted a copy.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.363
Wow! Maybe you should
think about publishing it.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.989
Hey, if you ask Daddy,

04:41.073 --> 04:42.658
he might even
give you some money to do it yourself.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.452
That's a great idea, Lois.
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.371
If this works out,
I could make more money

04:47.454 --> 04:49.414
than when I had
that rat farm in the basement.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.291
Armando,
do you have the rent?

04:51.375 --> 04:53.335
We are trying, Senor Griffin.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.629
But the land,
she gives us nothing.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.548
There is no sunlight.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.800
It's been two months, Armando.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.718
You're putting me
in a real awkward position here.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.053
Oh, please, Senor Griffin.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.514
Just one more week.
I will pay you double.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.141
Perhaps we can work out
another arrangement.

05:08.225 --> 05:11.728
Oh, please, Senor.
Not my beloved!

05:11.812 --> 05:16.275
Armando, Armando,
it is for the children.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.151
(sobbing)

05:18.235 --> 05:22.906
-(whimpering) Dios mio.
-(chuckling) Yes. Yes.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.701
He takes the beam.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.537
The spectators
hold their breath as Stewie Griffin

05:28.620 --> 05:32.082
is America's last hope
to take home the gold.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.877
Oh, oh.
Did you see that, Mitch?

05:34.960 --> 05:38.213
I sure did, Kathy. That was impressive.
Here comes the dismount.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.174
Hey, Stewie,
I just took a nap.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.341
You want an eye booger?

05:41.425 --> 05:42.426
(screaming)

05:42.509 --> 05:44.219
Oh, damn you, Chris!
Look what you've done!

05:44.303 --> 05:45.429
I'm training
for the Olympics,

05:45.512 --> 05:47.639
and I need
absolute concentration.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.310
Ugh, look at him.
Look how fat he is.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.769
Hmm.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.109
Oh, my God!
That was even cooler

05:59.193 --> 06:02.070
than playing
with the speech function on my Macintosh.

06:02.154 --> 06:05.449
So, computer,
what are you thinking about right now?

06:05.532 --> 06:07.284
COMPUTER VOICE:
Stewie is cool.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.662
Yay!
(chuckling)

06:14.541 --> 06:15.959
What do you want, homo?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.419
Listen, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.338
You're a businessman.
I'm a businessman.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.758
And I've got a proposal
that I guarantee you can't refuse.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.760
See,
I wrote this erotica book.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.554
And I was hoping you could loan me
$7 billion to publish it.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.056
How about I loan you
five dollars?

06:29.139 --> 06:32.809
It's at the bottom
of this jar of barbed wire and salt.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.479
Ah! Ow! Ow!

06:35.562 --> 06:38.524
Why do you keep
these things together?

06:39.733 --> 06:43.445
All right. Who wants to buy
some Peterotica? Ten bucks a pop.

06:43.529 --> 06:44.571
I'll take one.
Me, too.

06:44.655 --> 06:45.739
Hey, give me one of those.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.450
I look forward
to having a raging semi.

06:48.534 --> 06:49.576
Wow, Peter.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.620
You're going into
the publishing business?

06:51.703 --> 06:55.123
Yep. Mr. Pewterschmidt
gave me five dollars for these Xeroxes,

06:55.207 --> 06:56.959
and I haven't looked back.

07:13.392 --> 07:14.643
(murmuring)

07:14.726 --> 07:17.271
I'm such a huge fan
of Peterotica.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.856
There you go.
Thanks for reading.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.149
Hi. Would you be offended
if I told you

07:21.233 --> 07:25.153
your prose suggests a male,
working-class version of Emily Bronte?

07:25.237 --> 07:26.697
No. Would you be
offended if I said

07:26.780 --> 07:28.574
I'd like to use
your ass as a bongo drum?

07:28.657 --> 07:29.950
Yes.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.829
Well, then we are
on two different wavelengths.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.915
Peter Griffin.
Thanks for reading.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.800
BETTY: Welcome to
Peterotica on tape.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.970
I'm Betty White reading
The Hot Chick Who Was Italian

07:50.053 --> 07:53.390
-or Maybe Some Kind of Spanish,
-by Peter Griffin.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.017
"Chapter One.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.103
"Oh, God!
You should have seen this one hot chick.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.439
"She was totally Italian

08:00.522 --> 08:02.524
"or maybe
some kind of Spanish."

08:02.608 --> 08:04.651
Oh, yeah.
Getting hot in here.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.987
I better take my shirt off.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.280
(tires screeching)

08:08.363 --> 08:09.865
(screaming)

08:12.993 --> 08:16.121
Wow. You know, from the other side,
that's kind of annoying.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.876
Happy birthday, darling.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.880
Oh, honey, a fur coat.
Thank you.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.716
Well, it's not real fur.
It's actually made from bald eagle.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.384
And it's weather-treated
with a mixture

08:29.468 --> 08:31.553
of whale skin oil
and children's tears.

08:31.637 --> 08:32.763
(doorbell ringing)

08:32.846 --> 08:34.056
Yes?

08:34.139 --> 08:36.683
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
I'm Scott Greenberg, Attorney at Law.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.228
My client was injured
listening to this audio book.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.772
We're suing you
for every penny you've got.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.106
What? Why?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.399
You're liable as publisher.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.527
I'm here to seize
your assets.

08:49.738 --> 08:50.906
Griffin.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.034
Well, Mr. Greenberg,
I'd like to see you try to seize my assets

08:54.117 --> 08:56.203
after battling the rancor.

09:19.518 --> 09:22.771
Huh. Didn't realize
Greenberg was a Jedi name.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.362
(knocking on door)

09:31.738 --> 09:33.156
Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Hello, Peter.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.826
-What's up? Good. Oh, damn it!
-I mean, not much.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.953
What you got there?
Oh, this? It's a gun.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.705
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I'm going to kill you.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.331
Daddy, what are you doing?

09:41.415 --> 09:44.960
Your fat, bastard husband ruined me!
I lost my home, my money,

09:45.043 --> 09:47.337
and perhaps just as serious,
my wife left me!

09:47.421 --> 09:48.630
Mom left you?

09:48.714 --> 09:50.465
Yeah. She ran off
with Ted Turner.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.842
God only knows
what they're doing.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.386
-Should we give Elmo a bath?
-Yeah.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.638
-Should we give Telly a bath?
-Yeah!

09:56.722 --> 09:58.724
-Should we give Ernie a bath?
-No.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.934
Ernie doesn't like
the monsters.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.729
Look, you can stay
with us if you want, you filthy hobo.

10:03.812 --> 10:04.938
You shouldn't be
embarrassed

10:05.022 --> 10:06.732
about mooching off
your kids at age 70.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.026
Go to hell, fathead!
Have I used that one?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.736
No, I haven't.
Yeah, fathead.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.404
Daddy, don't talk
to Peter like that.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.740
All you've done
his whole life is treat him like crap,

10:14.823 --> 10:16.074
and now he's offering
to help you.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.659
The least you can do
is be grateful.

10:17.743 --> 10:18.869
Oh, all right.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.746
Then it's settled.
You're staying with us.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.039
I promise
you'll love it here,

10:22.122 --> 10:24.583
even more than
Julia Roberts loves herself.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.002
Hi, I'm Julia Roberts.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.546
You know,
a lot of people died in the tsunami.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.840
But don't worry. I didn't.

10:31.924 --> 10:35.552
And I'll be here
to entertain you and love my life

10:35.636 --> 10:38.472
for many, many years to come.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.474
Me!

10:40.557 --> 10:42.476
Me!

10:42.559 --> 10:44.394
Me!

10:44.478 --> 10:47.147
(laughing)

10:51.818 --> 10:53.362
Daddy, you're not dressed!

10:53.445 --> 10:55.405
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Couldn't figure that one out.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.490
Used to have a guy for that.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.952
Mom, I can't believe
you came out of that belly.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.081
Um... (sniffing)

11:04.164 --> 11:05.457
what is that?

11:05.541 --> 11:07.835
Daddy, did you, um,

11:07.918 --> 11:10.045
use the bathroom
this morning?

11:10.128 --> 11:11.129
Yeah.

11:11.213 --> 11:14.007
And did you remember
to clean up afterwards?

11:14.091 --> 11:16.343
Uh, no.
I was hoping you would--

11:16.426 --> 11:19.638
Oh, Daddy. No. No.
Okay. Brian?

11:19.721 --> 11:22.349
-Oh, God! No. No. No, no, no.
-I'll do it.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.644
Daddy, I never thought
you'd be so lost without your money.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.354
(sighing)
You're right, Lois.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.940
Who the hell am I kidding?
I can't live like this.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.775
I should never
have come here.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.778
Oh, I hate to see
Daddy like this.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.864
Maybe there's something
you can do to help cheer him up.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.116
Don't worry, Lois.
I know just what to do.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.578
I am gonna teach your father
how to be a regular guy.

11:42.661 --> 11:43.954
You think you can do that?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.373
Sure. I've steered our family
through bigger problems.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.126
Like when we were cartoon sketches
on The Tracey Ullman Show.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.879
Well,
that's the end of Puss.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.339
He was the best cat
anyone ever had.

11:54.423 --> 11:57.801
Hey, Lois, what do you say
we go downtown and buy a dog?

11:57.885 --> 11:59.636
Hey, wait a minute.
You already have a dog.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.804
So long, Puss.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.889
We'll miss you.

12:01.972 --> 12:03.348
It's gonna be
quite a different place

12:03.432 --> 12:05.225
with him gone.
That's for true.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.731
All right, Kathy.
It looks like Stewie Griffin

12:10.814 --> 12:13.901
is preparing to begin
the floor routine. That's right, Mitch.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.485
And as we watch
Griffin doing this,

12:15.569 --> 12:19.198
I want to remind everyone
that this is absolutely not gay.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.116
(music playing)

12:34.588 --> 12:36.006
Boy, that was really gay.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.425
No, no!
Didn't you just hear the announcers?

12:38.509 --> 12:39.676
They said it's not gay.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.261
Ha-ha!
Stewie one, you zero.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.013
What are we doing here?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.349
Listen, I know you're upset
about losing your money,

12:45.432 --> 12:48.936
so I wanted to show you
it's not so bad living like a regular guy.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.153
So these people live here?
No, this is a bus.

12:58.237 --> 13:01.698
People ride it to get places
that they need to go.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.991
You look familiar.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.285
I was your gardener
for 12 years.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.746
Oh. You look different
without my lawn under you.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.957
I don't take the lawn
with me when I go.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.084
Well, I was right
to trust you with it then.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.879
And this is called
waiting in line at the movies.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.297
It's what us
regular people do.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.675
Trust me.
It makes it that much more special

13:19.758 --> 13:21.802
when we finally get inside
and see Renee Zellweger

13:21.885 --> 13:24.012
doing her whole
scrunch-face routine.

13:24.096 --> 13:25.430
ANNOUNCER:
Coming this March,

13:25.514 --> 13:27.349
Jude Law and Renee Zellweger

13:27.432 --> 13:28.892
in The Picnic.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.062
Oh, no. These ants
are ruining our picnic.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.107
You mean this picnic
is ruining our ants.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.235
Look around your world,
pretty baby

13:38.318 --> 13:42.239
Is it everything
you hoped it'd be?

13:44.032 --> 13:46.785
You know, Peter,
what you showed me today was just awful.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.453
What are you talking about?

13:48.537 --> 13:50.956
I really don't see what's so great
about being a regular person.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.333
The bus smells like crap,
the movie theater is sticky,

13:53.417 --> 13:55.961
and Renee Zellweger
should only be the cute friend at best.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.297
You know,
I never thought about it till now,

13:58.380 --> 14:01.133
but maybe being
a regular person does suck.

14:01.216 --> 14:04.011
My God. Is this what my whole life
is destined to be?

14:04.094 --> 14:05.429
Not unless
you do something about it.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.972
Yeah. But what?

14:07.055 --> 14:10.350
Carter, hand me
my thinking grenades.

14:10.434 --> 14:11.476
Where did you get these?

14:11.560 --> 14:13.395
Shh.
Carter, I'm thinking.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.232
-(explosion)
-Uh-huh.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.652
MAN:
Oh, my God! He's dead!

14:20.736 --> 14:22.321
That might work.

14:23.822 --> 14:24.823
What's happening?

14:24.907 --> 14:26.200
I got it!

14:26.283 --> 14:30.329
Carter, somehow you and me
are gonna find a way to get rich.

14:30.412 --> 14:31.830
Now you're talking
my language.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.332
All right, then, let's do it!

14:33.415 --> 14:34.541
(doorbell ringing)

14:36.084 --> 14:37.294
Hi. I'm Betty White.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.339
I just got a subpoena
regarding an erotic novel,

14:40.422 --> 14:43.258
and I'm looking
for the son of a bitch responsible.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.683
All right, Peter, how are we gonna
do this? How are we gonna get rich?

14:51.767 --> 14:53.310
Well, I say we start out
small, Carter.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.853
Here's my plan.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.523
I'll distract Lois
while you steal money from her purse.

14:58.524 --> 15:00.317
Lois, look at me!
Look at me! Look at me!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.194
(laughing)

15:02.277 --> 15:04.196
(humming)

15:09.785 --> 15:11.912
Cacaw! I've got
her wallet! Cacaw!

15:11.995 --> 15:13.539
Daddy, what are you doing?

15:13.622 --> 15:15.082
Look at the unicycle!

15:15.165 --> 15:17.334
Well, she's got
ten dollars in here,

15:17.417 --> 15:20.921
and it cost me $900
for the six weeks of unicycle lessons.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.006
So we're a little
in the red right now,

15:23.090 --> 15:26.051
but you got to spend money
to make money, champ. Moving on.

15:28.846 --> 15:31.849
All right.
Now we play it cool.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.184
Hey, Meg.
Uh, we're trying to make some money.

15:34.268 --> 15:36.019
And, um...

15:36.103 --> 15:38.689
Would you like to buy some pot
from your granddaddy and me?

15:38.772 --> 15:41.358
Um, wow! Sure.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.235
Oh, fantastic.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.903
What the hell
was that for?

15:44.987 --> 15:47.197
Now we have the pot
and the money.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.950
You sure this is
gonna work, Peter?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.910
All I know is
there's a lot of money to be made

15:51.994 --> 15:54.746
in these stupid teen dramas
they keep putting on TV.

15:54.830 --> 15:57.165
And we're gonna
get our share.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.711
(humming)

16:03.839 --> 16:05.382
I don't wanna wait

16:05.465 --> 16:09.136
For my lunch to get colder

16:09.219 --> 16:12.973
Why can't I eat it now?

16:13.056 --> 16:15.058
I don't want to wait

16:15.142 --> 16:16.643
(humming)

16:16.727 --> 16:18.562
The new Toyota

16:18.645 --> 16:22.733
I want a car
that's got a lot of gas

16:22.816 --> 16:25.277
Come on, Joey.
I wanna be with you.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.905
Dawson, I'm just not ready
to give up my virginity.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.781
Come on.
No!

16:29.865 --> 16:32.659
I promised myself
that I'd save it for the man that I marry.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.077
Come on. That's stupid.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.663
-I'm-- I'm just not comfortable, you know?
-Well, I don't--

16:36.747 --> 16:38.332
This-- This is, like,
the '90s, man.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.501
I mean, like, everybody--

16:40.584 --> 16:44.171
Come on. You saw me on that boat.
I was wearing a blazer.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.340
Huh? Come on.
No! I just--

16:46.423 --> 16:48.342
I-- I don't want to! All right?
I don't want to right now!

16:48.425 --> 16:50.010
I told you
I'm not comfortable.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.512
I think
you could respect that.

16:51.595 --> 16:53.889
-You know?
-I do respec-- I totally respect it.

16:53.972 --> 16:56.099
That just makes me
want you more, you know?

16:56.183 --> 16:59.102
Come on, man. Let's just--
Let's just go nuts. Let's just--

16:59.186 --> 17:01.438
-No, I said-- I don't--
-Come on!

17:01.522 --> 17:03.899
I don't want-- No!
No! Peter, stop! Just stop! All right!

17:03.982 --> 17:05.108
Turn off the camera!

17:05.192 --> 17:07.027
God, I'm sorry,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.862
I don't want to
do this anymore, all right?

17:08.946 --> 17:10.030
You know what?
You went too far.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.448
What?
You went too far.

17:11.532 --> 17:12.866
That's his character.
That's how--

17:12.950 --> 17:13.992
I mean,
he's that kind of--

17:14.076 --> 17:15.077
No! Forget it. Forget it.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.286
You know what?
It's just weird, man.

17:16.370 --> 17:17.663
It's just weird.
You're weird.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.122
All right?
Just get off it.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.250
Let's just do something else
to make money.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.585
And we will be back.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.509
Stand back, Brian.
I'm preparing for my vault.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.220
You can't vault inside the living room.
You're gonna get hurt.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.347
Yeah. I'll get hurt
right onto a Wheaties box.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.431
I don't see that happening.

17:36.557 --> 17:37.891
Yeah?
Who cares what you say?

17:37.975 --> 17:40.352
You're a dog.
You can't see colors.

17:40.435 --> 17:43.397
Which means you can't see
the colors of the American flag.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.565
Commie.

17:49.278 --> 17:51.572
(sighing)
I think I'm okay.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.576
(screaming)

17:55.659 --> 17:59.746
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!

17:59.830 --> 18:01.915
Oh, God! Somebody!

18:01.999 --> 18:03.542
Do I take it out,
or do I leave it in?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.085
Do I take it out,
or do I leave it in?

18:05.169 --> 18:06.503
(screaming)

18:07.880 --> 18:10.174
Got it! We'll rob a train.
Love it.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.681
All aboard!

18:21.435 --> 18:23.103
All right, everybody.
This is a--

18:23.187 --> 18:24.479
Hey, where the hell
is everybody?

18:24.563 --> 18:26.356
Oh, we haven't had
a paying customer in months.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.567
Nobody rides
the train anymore.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.444
Oh, well, for God's sake!

18:30.527 --> 18:33.655
Uh, are--
Are you robbers?

18:33.739 --> 18:35.240
Yeah.

18:35.324 --> 18:36.742
Well, you could,
you could take my wallet.

18:36.825 --> 18:39.161
My MasterCard's in there.
Although, to be honest,

18:39.244 --> 18:42.289
I'll probably just cancel it
before you can use it. So...

18:42.372 --> 18:44.082
Oh, um...

18:45.250 --> 18:46.752
Give me that hole punch!

18:46.835 --> 18:48.670
(laughing) Yeah!

18:48.754 --> 18:51.089
Is this-- Is this your hole punch
or the-- or the train company's?

18:51.173 --> 18:52.341
Well, that's--
You know--

18:52.424 --> 18:53.926
I got-- I got
to pay for that.

18:54.009 --> 18:56.178
That-- That comes out
of my paycheck if you-- if you take it.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.346
Oh, oh, really?

18:57.429 --> 18:58.847
Uh...
Yeah.

18:58.931 --> 19:00.849
Well, I can't
in all good conscience take that, then.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.226
Oh, oh, good. Uh, thank you.
Thank you, that's--

19:02.309 --> 19:03.310
Yeah. Yeah.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.229
No. I'm-- I'm,
I'm a working man myself.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.396
No. It's tough out there.
Yeah.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.523
You know, you can't--

19:07.606 --> 19:10.359
You got to find a way.
It's tough, it is.

19:10.442 --> 19:11.944
All right.
Well, uh, can you stop this thing,

19:12.027 --> 19:13.362
so we can get off?

19:13.445 --> 19:15.572
Uh, no. I mean,
I-- I'd love to.

19:15.656 --> 19:18.033
Uh, but it-- it stops at
the predesignated stops.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.786
You know, I don't--
I don't have control, you know, over that.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.162
-Oh. That's-- The engineer
-who does that stuff.

19:22.246 --> 19:23.288
Well, how...

19:23.372 --> 19:25.457
Uh, well,
how much are our tickets?

19:25.541 --> 19:28.210
Well, for this, this is a
first-- first-class cabin.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.878
It's, uh, 25 bucks.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.713
Wow! And we're the robbers.

19:31.797 --> 19:34.049
Um, okay, uh, uh.
How much is coach?

19:34.132 --> 19:35.801
Uh, $12 for coach.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.177
Well, he's a senior--

19:37.261 --> 19:38.345
You know what?
That-- That's fine.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.889
Just give me
two coach tickets.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.224
All right, thank you.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.393
Oh, wow! When did Mamma Mia!
come to the Oakdale?

19:44.476 --> 19:46.395
Oh, yeah. What--
Just a week ago, I think.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.605
Oh, wow! We-- We should go.
Do you want to--

19:48.689 --> 19:49.982
You want to
go see Mamma Mia?

19:50.065 --> 19:52.651
Peter, could I speak to you
over by the door?

19:55.946 --> 19:56.989
Good as new.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.825
Oh, come on!

20:02.160 --> 20:03.370
I give up.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.039
We're gonna be
lower middle-class Americans forever.

20:06.123 --> 20:07.583
A fate worse than death.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.626
Seriously,
we may as well just be dead.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.753
You know what, Peter?
That's not true.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.423
In the time we've spent together,
I've learned something.

20:14.506 --> 20:17.259
When you're rich,
you don't own your possessions,

20:17.342 --> 20:19.052
your possessions own you.

20:19.136 --> 20:20.429
Oh, Carter, darling!

20:20.512 --> 20:22.264
Babs, sweetheart!

20:22.347 --> 20:23.849
Honey, we're rich again.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.476
I divorced Ted Turner
and took half his money.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.437
We own half of CNN.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.147
-Hey, hey!
-And TNT.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.356
Neat!

20:31.440 --> 20:34.109
-All right, buddy, we did it! We're rich!
-"We"?

20:34.193 --> 20:35.777
Go to hell,
you fat peasant!

20:35.861 --> 20:37.279
Aw, crap!

20:37.362 --> 20:40.574
Peter, listen to me.
Money doesn't matter.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.869
Ten years ago Daddy offered
to give us $10 million,

20:43.952 --> 20:45.329
and I turned it down.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.455
What?
Yes.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.956
And I'll always
turn it down,

20:48.040 --> 20:50.834
because money just
complicates everything.

20:50.918 --> 20:53.962
We don't need money,
because we have each other.

20:54.046 --> 20:56.632
Happiness isn't about
buying expensive things,

20:56.715 --> 20:58.842
it's about being together.

20:58.926 --> 21:01.970
It's not about
taking expensive trips.

21:02.054 --> 21:05.307
It's about
holding each other during a thunderstorm.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.809
And we have that kind
of happiness, Peter.

21:07.893 --> 21:11.480
Real happiness
because we have each other.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.023
Yeah.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.654
