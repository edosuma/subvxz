When I left the FBI, I thought

my crime-fighting days were

00:07.220 --> 00:09.870
that terrorist Karim Farouk
was on the hunt for Cleopatra,

one of the world's

of a massive terror attack.

10:36.110 --> 10:38.110
those cops out there
protecting me?

10:38.150 --> 10:39.760
They did just let me almost
stab you in the heart

10:39.810 --> 10:41.070
with adrenaline.

10:41.110 --> 10:42.330
That is a fair point.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.940
DANNY:
The only way you survive

10:43.990 --> 10:45.680
is working with us.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.160
Farouk was paying Shaw

10:48.210 --> 10:51.080
through a hawala transaction
in Paris.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.860
So it's a dead end.

10:52.910 --> 10:55.740
Hawala's an ancient system
of undocumented money transfers,

10:55.780 --> 10:57.300
based on honor code.

10:57.350 --> 10:58.700
There is no
transaction record,

10:58.740 --> 11:00.700
no paper trail
to follow to Farouk.

11:00.740 --> 11:03.480
Shaw goes to a hawaladar
with the right password,

11:03.530 --> 11:05.750
and a predetermined amount
changes hands.

11:05.790 --> 11:09.140
The banker and the sender
settle up after, right?

11:09.190 --> 11:11.100
Yes.So here's the plan.

11:11.140 --> 11:13.970
We go to the hawaladar,
use Shaw's password.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.450
Now, Farouk wants Shaw dead,
so trying to claim the money

11:16.500 --> 11:18.110
should trigger a call to him.

11:18.150 --> 11:20.020
Will they think Shaw is dumb
enough to collect the money

11:20.070 --> 11:21.630
after Farouk shot him?

11:21.680 --> 11:23.720
Oh, I think we're good
on that front.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.460
[camera clicking]

11:26.510 --> 11:29.900
Yeah, let's trace a call,
get Farouk's location.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.160
It's a great plan.

11:32.210 --> 11:34.040
Did you get the password?I did.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.040
What is it? Wa enta Malak.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.080
That means
"None of your business."

11:38.130 --> 11:40.260
Does it? Hmm.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.040
DANNY:
Lexi got Shaw
to give the password

11:42.090 --> 11:43.790
just to her, uh,
he's got kind of a crush.

11:45.130 --> 11:46.570
GWEN:
Hmm.

11:46.610 --> 11:49.440
Guess we're all going to Paris.

11:49.490 --> 11:52.710
OMAR:
Farouk, as requested.

11:56.190 --> 11:58.190
Well done, Omar.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.430
Hmm.

12:18.470 --> 12:21.470
Cleopatra was taken to Germany.

12:32.140 --> 12:35.010
Soon we will have
everything we need.

12:41.230 --> 12:43.240
[music playing in distance]

12:54.940 --> 12:56.550
DANNY:
Can Shaw see us?

12:56.600 --> 12:57.640
ASIM [over radio]:
He can see.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.600
SHAW:
I cannot see. Hand over

12:59.640 --> 13:00.820
them giant-ass binoculars
you got,

13:00.860 --> 13:03.650
and maybe I can I.D. the man.

13:03.690 --> 13:05.820
Hey, don't touch.
They're very expensive.

13:05.870 --> 13:07.910
Just so you know, the way
you're treating me right now

13:07.960 --> 13:09.650
isn't good for team morale.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.440
You're not on the team.
Just I.D. the banker.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.400
Uh, could you adjust the focus?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.190
Hmm...

13:21.230 --> 13:22.750
He had a beard.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.710
GWEN:
Can you be a little bit

13:27.760 --> 13:29.020
more specific?

13:29.060 --> 13:30.370
[sighs]
Old guy,

13:30.410 --> 13:32.200
wears dark glasses, even inside.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.460
DANNY:
Copy that.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.460
Heading inside.

13:36.510 --> 13:41.510
Inside, 15 paces south,
turning west.

13:41.550 --> 13:43.560
Let me handle him.

13:51.560 --> 13:55.570
Are you the man
selling Skinjbeer?

13:55.610 --> 13:57.960
Skinjbeer.

13:59.620 --> 14:03.140
That would make you
Mr. Shaw, then, yes?

14:03.190 --> 14:06.280
That's me. Mr. Shaw.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.800
And that would make you...

14:07.840 --> 14:08.840
Eager to get on with it.

14:22.510 --> 14:23.950
Mr. Shaw,

14:23.990 --> 14:28.080
seeking remittance for
a transaction dating back to...

14:32.480 --> 14:34.000
One moment.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.700
You ready to start the trace?

14:36.740 --> 14:39.000
Agent Danny from FBI.

14:39.050 --> 14:41.180
Ooh...

14:41.220 --> 14:43.570
Agent Danny, it's me, Marwan.
You remember? From Iraq.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.050
You saved my life.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.230
This is not good.

14:46.270 --> 14:48.010
I was interpreter for his FBI.

14:48.060 --> 14:49.270
Best one they had.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.100
Danny secured exit visas
for my family.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.110
I think you have
the wrong person.Yeah, you're mistaken, friend.

14:54.150 --> 14:55.670
I-I guess I just have

14:55.720 --> 14:57.460
[chuckles]:
one of those faces.Mistaken?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.460
I named my youngest child
after you.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.030
DANNY:
Th-This is...

15:02.070 --> 15:03.290
not what it looks like.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.990
[whistles]

15:05.030 --> 15:06.510
LEXI:
This is why

15:06.550 --> 15:08.860
you should never
be nice to people.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.260
My nephews.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.170
With apologies,

15:15.210 --> 15:18.130
Agent Danny.

15:19.830 --> 15:20.870
[grunting]

15:28.840 --> 15:30.140

[shouts]

15:52.990 --> 15:55.910
[groaning]

16:01.690 --> 16:03.610
I think we kind of got off
on the wrong food.

16:03.650 --> 16:05.660
[doors thud][people screaming]

16:09.530 --> 16:11.700
[grunting]

16:19.190 --> 16:20.320
Ooh.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.240
[exhales]
Where's the banker?

16:26.280 --> 16:28.370
Has anyone seen Lexi?

16:31.200 --> 16:33.380
[bystanders murmuring]

16:34.420 --> 16:36.730
Get off me!

16:38.300 --> 16:40.300
[laughs]:
He's surprisingly spry.

16:41.820 --> 16:45.090
[coughing]

16:45.130 --> 16:47.130
Bloody hell.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.960
[panting]

16:56.360 --> 16:58.660
Any luck?He got away.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.140
You all right?

17:00.190 --> 17:02.710
Things got out of hand fast.

17:04.670 --> 17:06.240
Your plan almost worked.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.460
Hey, thanks for having
my back in there.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.030
Well, we would both be dead
if it wasn't for Agent Karlsson.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.550
Well, I'd feel better if we
got more for our efforts.

17:13.590 --> 17:15.070
[chuckles]:
You are so Swedish.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.860
Well, we didn't get
the phone trace,

17:16.900 --> 17:18.900
but maybe one of these nephews
will give something up.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.380
Already started
the extradition paperwork.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.640
We'll bring them back to Rome
as part

17:21.690 --> 17:22.860
of the Farouk investigation?

17:22.910 --> 17:25.820
Uh, where's Shaw?

17:25.870 --> 17:27.870
In there.

17:32.740 --> 17:34.310
[speaking Swedish]

17:35.480 --> 17:36.920
He stole my binoculars.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.100
You have to admire
the man's consistency.

17:39.140 --> 17:41.100
"Admire" is a
strong word.

17:41.140 --> 17:43.670
All right, let's wrap this up
and get back to Rome.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.100
Asim, I'm still waiting

17:45.150 --> 17:47.580
for your special assignment
paperwork from G.I.D.?

17:47.630 --> 17:49.450
I need it if you are
going to continue

17:49.500 --> 17:51.020
to work on this investigation.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.460
I'll see what the holdup is.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.250
So that old guy
really outran you?

17:58.290 --> 18:00.380
He was surprisingly spry.

18:00.420 --> 18:03.160
Huh.But I got his ledger.

18:03.210 --> 18:06.040
All the hawaladar transactions
in one place.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.300
What kind of
code is this?

18:07.340 --> 18:08.910
No idea.

18:08.950 --> 18:10.300
But it'll be worth
its weight in gold

18:10.350 --> 18:11.520
as soon as we figure it out.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.300
Interpol can help us crack it.

18:13.350 --> 18:16.610
Let's keep it between us
for now.

18:16.660 --> 18:20.010
Look, I've just...
I've been thinking.

18:20.050 --> 18:21.830
The Egyptians have now
been involved

18:21.880 --> 18:24.750
in two separate
failed operations on Farouk.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.800
You think Farouk has a mole
inside Egyptian intelligence?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.320
Remember
that capture mission,

18:28.360 --> 18:29.970
when Farouk's car
suddenly changed course

18:30.020 --> 18:31.980
and veered
into some populated area?

18:32.020 --> 18:34.500
Yeah. Asim was there.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.240
Yeah, exactly.

18:36.280 --> 18:39.370
And now he showed up
in some brand-new investigation

18:39.420 --> 18:41.160
with no
official paperwork?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.380
When it comes
to Farouk,

18:42.420 --> 18:44.250
there's no one I trust
outside of you and me.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.120
And definitely not Asim.

18:52.820 --> 18:55.130
FABI:
Really? So none of you
are going to talk, huh?

18:56.170 --> 18:58.220
Want to speak, or no?[phone chimes]

19:10.580 --> 19:13.190
Every one of them
is silent as the grave.

19:13.230 --> 19:15.580
They could teach
the mafia about omertà.

19:15.630 --> 19:17.150
None of these guys
are going to talk.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.540
They're not going
to betray family

19:18.590 --> 19:20.150
unless properly leveraged.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.500
I'm hoping "properly leveraged"

19:21.550 --> 19:23.240
doesn't mean
what I think it means.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.330
My point is, they should
be questioned in Egypt.

19:25.380 --> 19:27.510
Anything we get
out of them under torture

19:27.550 --> 19:29.860
is inadmissible
in court.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.600
Look, I'd, I'd like to try
talking with them.

19:33.910 --> 19:34.820
You can observe only.

19:34.860 --> 19:36.390
[sighs]

19:40.700 --> 19:41.960
[door closes]

19:42.000 --> 19:44.400

19:44.440 --> 19:46.350
Geez. Ah, oh...

19:46.400 --> 19:48.230
Father Chuck.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.970
I've made some tea if you'd
like some. You look tired.

19:51.010 --> 19:55.010
I distinctly recall telling
Danny to use good judgment,

19:55.060 --> 19:57.760
and that does not include
giving you my key.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.060
You did.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.370
And he didn't.So you broke in.

20:01.410 --> 20:04.020
The lock is so flimsy, I would
barely consider it breaking in.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.680
You finding everything you need?

20:05.720 --> 20:07.330
Snack selection
was underwhelming.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.770
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.250
Well, next time you plan on
breaking in, let me know

20:10.290 --> 20:12.210
and I'll set out
a charcuterie plate.[chuckles]

20:12.250 --> 20:13.690
What is that?

20:13.730 --> 20:16.820
This is a ledger we got
from a hawaladar in Paris

20:16.860 --> 20:19.080
that has encoded transactions
with Farouk.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.820
I'm gonna need, like,
five minutes

20:20.870 --> 20:22.220
to process that sentence.

20:22.260 --> 20:23.430
Simple version:

20:23.480 --> 20:25.260
I crack this code,

20:25.310 --> 20:27.220
we get a step closer to Farouk.

20:30.310 --> 20:33.270
FATHER CHUCK:
Looks like a dead language.

20:33.310 --> 20:34.790
LEXI:Exactly what I
was thinking.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.270
Thus, I broke into
your place to access

20:36.320 --> 20:38.620
your extensive collection
of old-timey books.

20:38.670 --> 20:41.500
All right, just so
I'm keeping track.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.670
Breaking into my
apartment: bad.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.280
Trying to stop
terrorist: good.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.510
I guess, in this case, the
good outweighs the bad.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.120
So you're helping?

20:54.160 --> 20:56.510
Yeah, I mean,
I'm no Magnum P.I.,

20:56.550 --> 20:59.170
but if it's just comparing
things, I can do that.

20:59.210 --> 21:01.470
Well, I appreciate it.

21:06.090 --> 21:09.610
It's strange to me that Danny's
never mentioned you,

21:09.650 --> 21:11.310
considering how close
you two are.

21:11.350 --> 21:14.310
Well, Danny's a complicated guy.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.750
He follows rules and does
the right thing unfailingly.

21:17.790 --> 21:19.620
He's the furthest thing
from complicated.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.410
Okay.

21:21.450 --> 21:25.280
[chuckling]:
What? Am I wrong?

21:25.320 --> 21:27.800
You and Danny have a lot more
in common than you think.

21:27.850 --> 21:30.410
[laughs] How do you figure?

21:30.460 --> 21:33.330
Something tells me you're not
ready to wade into these waters.

21:33.370 --> 21:36.330
No, I don't want to talk
about me, I want dirt on Danny.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.990
Somebody here could use a drink.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.420
I think I can
handle it.

21:39.470 --> 21:41.470
I wasn't talking about you.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.340
GWEN:
Where is Karim Farouk?

21:46.390 --> 21:49.390
I'm telling you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

21:49.430 --> 21:51.440
You do realize you're
facing assault charges

21:51.480 --> 21:55.440
on law enforcement,
as well as terrorism charges,

21:55.480 --> 21:57.490
yeah?

21:58.570 --> 22:01.360
I'm not a terrorist.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.670
You are involved in
the financing of terrorists,

22:03.710 --> 22:06.360
which means there are different
rules for how we can charge you,

22:06.410 --> 22:08.370
where we can send you,
and I don't mean France.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.420
You're afraid
of him, huh?

22:14.460 --> 22:16.110
[scoffs]

22:16.160 --> 22:19.640
You should be afraid of him.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.770
He's here because
of the pyramid attack.

22:22.810 --> 22:25.380
I can turn you over to G.I.D.

22:26.990 --> 22:28.690
Tell me, Khalid,

22:28.730 --> 22:32.610
what do you think they will
do to you in Egypt, huh?

22:35.130 --> 22:37.480
What do you think
he will do to you?

22:44.710 --> 22:47.750
DANNY:
I've got an idea.
Be right back.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.450
Danny and I find a case
of sacramental wine.

22:50.490 --> 22:54.410
So the next morning, we wake up
on the floor of the sacristy,

22:54.460 --> 22:57.890

is screaming so loud.

22:57.940 --> 22:59.940

are still ringing.

22:59.980 --> 23:03.030
I can't picture Danny
doing any of this.Yeah, well,

23:03.070 --> 23:05.380
we got all the stupid
out of us early.

23:05.420 --> 23:07.690
Ugh, I got to lay
off this hooch.

23:07.730 --> 23:10.690
I can't tell whether this
is some ancient language

23:10.730 --> 23:14.080
or English at
this point.

23:14.130 --> 23:17.870
That is Coptic.
My mom had a bible like that.

23:17.910 --> 23:21.660
Your mom was a Coptic Christian?

23:21.700 --> 23:25.700
Dad was Muslim. I was, um,
you know, caught in the middle.

23:25.750 --> 23:28.270
That couldn't have been easy.

23:28.310 --> 23:30.620
After my mom died,
I didn't believe in any of it,

23:30.670 --> 23:32.840
so that cleared
everything right up.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.240
Out of curiosity, how old
were you when your ma died?

23:38.280 --> 23:40.940
I was eight.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.720
Is that when you
started stealing?

23:43.770 --> 23:46.640
Why?

23:46.680 --> 23:48.640
Childhood abandonment

23:48.680 --> 23:51.470
leaves a person feeling unsafe,

23:51.510 --> 23:53.860
so they assert control
however they can.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.470
You know, they see a-a thing
they want, they take it.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.170
They see a door that's
locked, they open it.

23:59.220 --> 24:03.440
It's their way of saying to the
world, "You don't control me."

24:05.530 --> 24:08.440
Doesn't sound familiar.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.100

languages are the same.

24:54.310 --> 24:56.320

24:57.490 --> 25:00.490
I'm fascinated
by the hawala system.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.800

25:01.840 --> 25:04.540

25:06.500 --> 25:08.280

than an ironclad honor code.

25:15.550 --> 25:16.510
It's still in place,

25:16.550 --> 25:18.560
even today.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.300
Hawala means "exchange"
in Arabic,

25:21.340 --> 25:26.000
but its original meaning
is "trust" in Hindi.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.350
The whole hawala
system is built

25:28.390 --> 25:31.000
on that one word: trust.

everything Egyptian

36:43.150 --> 36:45.290
[laughs airily]

36:45.330 --> 36:47.200
How are you?

36:47.240 --> 36:50.290
Well, I got to remember
to keep my elbow up.

36:50.330 --> 36:51.900
You know, swing through the ball
a little bit more.

36:51.940 --> 36:53.420
I meant about today.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.820
I know.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.390
I was wrong.

37:00.430 --> 37:02.390
I feel...

37:02.430 --> 37:05.480
terrible about suspecting Asim.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.220
He was just trying to
stop Farouk, same as us.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.140
He didn't die in vain.

37:10.180 --> 37:14.270
I mean, finding one of Farouk's
safe houses is a big deal.

37:14.310 --> 37:16.490
It'll force him
to alter his plans.

37:16.530 --> 37:19.280
He'll start making mistakes.How do you know?

37:19.320 --> 37:21.280
That's how I found him
the first time.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.320
This should also help.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.590
Where did you get this?

37:29.630 --> 37:31.290
Farouk's safe house.

37:31.330 --> 37:33.070
Grabbed it at
the firefight.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.810
"Bavaria, 1944."

37:35.860 --> 37:38.510
The Nazis got Cleopatra
to Germany.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.470
Look, I've been thinking.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.690
Asim said something before
we breached the safe house

37:46.740 --> 37:51.130
about Egyptian culture
being appropriated by the West.

37:51.180 --> 37:53.700
Now the same goes
for Cleopatra and Antony.

37:53.740 --> 37:55.660
They were a symbol for both.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.180
But their union led to a war
between East and West,

37:58.230 --> 38:01.100
and ultimately brought down
the Egyptian dynasty.

38:01.140 --> 38:05.280
Now, Farouk's attacks always
have an element of symbolism.

38:05.320 --> 38:08.590
Maybe reuniting them is all part
of a plan to drive East and West

38:08.630 --> 38:10.410
into an all-out war.

38:10.460 --> 38:12.070
Farouk went to a lot of effort

38:12.110 --> 38:13.590
to get that photograph.

38:13.630 --> 38:15.810
He's gonna go to
wherever it was taken.Yeah.

38:15.850 --> 38:18.330
Narrowing it down will take
some work, but we'll find it.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.380
We'll find him.

38:20.420 --> 38:23.340
Danny, don't
worry about me.

38:23.380 --> 38:25.340
This time I'll be ready.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.870
Yeah.

38:34.260 --> 38:36.270
Wh-When you texted me before,

38:36.310 --> 38:37.530
you said something about...

38:37.570 --> 38:39.220
not having control issues?

38:39.270 --> 38:41.230
What-what was that?

38:41.270 --> 38:43.360
Stupid Chuck.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.360
He's all in my head now.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.190
He says we have control issues.

38:47.230 --> 38:48.410
Both of us.

38:48.450 --> 38:50.190
Chuck thinks a lot of things.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.460
Did he tell you
his theory on Amelia Earhart?

38:52.500 --> 38:55.200
MAN [over phone]:
Fabi, was it Asim Masood?

38:55.240 --> 38:57.030
Masood was not
the mole in Egypt.

38:57.070 --> 38:59.070
There's only one option left.

39:00.420 --> 39:04.290
They're on their way to Germany,
as is Farouk.

39:04.340 --> 39:06.950
We'll be ready,
whoever finds her.
