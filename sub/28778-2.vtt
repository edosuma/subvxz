00:01.950 --> 00:03.610
My name is Danny McNamara.

00:03.650 --> 00:05.130
When I left the FBI, I thought

00:05.170 --> 00:07.180
my crime-fighting days were
over, but then I learned

00:07.220 --> 00:09.870
that terrorist Karim Farouk
was on the hunt for Cleopatra,

00:09.920 --> 00:11.880
one of the world's
most valuable treasures,

00:11.920 --> 00:13.490
lost for over 2,000 years,

00:13.530 --> 00:15.660
to use her as part
of a massive terror attack.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.580
To find him,
I needed some help,

00:17.620 --> 00:20.020
so I went to Lexi Vaziri,
a thief.

00:20.060 --> 00:22.370
LEXI:
Excuse me, a master thief.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.500
And my father
was killed by Farouk.

DANNY:
Lexi and I have
a complicated past.

00:27.110 --> 00:30.420
LEXI:
He wants to bring Farouk
to justice, I want revenge.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.720
DANNY:
Also, there's
a mysterious group

00:32.770 --> 00:34.290
who want Cleopatra
as much as we do.

We're not sure
whether they're good or bad,

we all agree on...

DANNY:
Is that we need
to find Cleopatra...

Oh, my God, you're Lexi.

00:52.310 --> 00:54.090
It looks like
you're getting mixed up

00:54.140 --> 00:56.830
with a criminal who's already
broken your heart once.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.920
Omar, I need you
to find the girl,

00:58.970 --> 01:02.190
the American, and Aiden Shaw,
then kill them all.

01:03.010 --> 01:05.020
DANNY:
Aiden Shaw was Farouk's fence.

01:05.060 --> 01:06.580
He is our only thread
to finding him.

01:06.630 --> 01:09.110
Agent Karlsson.Captain Fabi.

Why is the Carabinieri
following Danny McNamara?

The Nazis took Cleopatra
in the 1940s.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.160
I am just trying

01:17.200 --> 01:19.070
to figure out why.DANNY: What if they were trying

01:19.120 --> 01:21.600
to turn an artifact into
a weapon of mass destruction?

01:21.640 --> 01:23.860
Maybe that's what
Farouk wants to do.

01:23.900 --> 01:26.600
Fabi, if anyone gets
in our way,

01:26.650 --> 01:28.170
it will be up to you

Welcome to La casa di Chuck.

01:41.710 --> 01:44.230
I promise it's
only temporary.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.190
Yeah, yeah,
I know, sure.

01:46.230 --> 01:48.060
It's all right.
I don't mind if you

01:48.100 --> 01:50.450
squat here, but, um...Ooh, yes, nice sword.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.500
You know...

01:51.540 --> 01:53.410
You know what?Wha...? Hey-hey.

01:53.460 --> 01:54.630
Do you mind?

01:54.670 --> 01:57.070
That is the sword
of St. Ignatius of Loyola,

01:57.110 --> 01:58.370
the founder of the Jesuits.

01:58.420 --> 02:00.250
No kidding?I mean, it's a replica.

02:00.290 --> 02:04.080
[scoffs]Well, it's a 300-year-old
replica.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.640
Maybe it's not such a good idea
if you guys both stay here.

02:06.690 --> 02:08.170
You know, there's
not a lot of room...

02:08.210 --> 02:10.520
We just need some place
to get our feet under us

02:10.560 --> 02:12.040
until we find Farouk.No worries.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.170
"Jesuit chic" isn't
exactly my style.

02:15.220 --> 02:18.350
I'll stay at my ex's place.
He's got plenty of room.

02:18.390 --> 02:20.180
Is he in town, or...?

02:20.220 --> 02:22.220
Guess we'll find out.

02:22.270 --> 02:25.750
All right, while you
two figure this out,

02:25.790 --> 02:27.490
I got a class
to go teach.

Oh, one more thing.

from the pyramid.

10:36.110 --> 10:38.110
those cops out there
protecting me?

10:38.150 --> 10:39.760
They did just let me almost
stab you in the heart

10:39.810 --> 10:41.070
with adrenaline.

10:41.110 --> 10:42.330
That is a fair point.

10:42.380 --> 10:43.940
DANNY:
The only way you survive

10:43.990 --> 10:45.680
is working with us.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.160
Farouk was paying Shaw

10:48.210 --> 10:51.080
through a hawala transaction
in Paris.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.860
So it's a dead end.

10:52.910 --> 10:55.740
Hawala's an ancient system
of undocumented money transfers,

10:55.780 --> 10:57.300
based on honor code.

10:57.350 --> 10:58.700
There is no
transaction record,

10:58.740 --> 11:00.700
no paper trail
to follow to Farouk.

11:00.740 --> 11:03.480
Shaw goes to a hawaladar
with the right password,

11:03.530 --> 11:05.750
and a predetermined amount
changes hands.

11:05.790 --> 11:09.140
The banker and the sender
settle up after, right?

11:09.190 --> 11:11.100
Yes.So here's the plan.

11:11.140 --> 11:13.970
We go to the hawaladar,
use Shaw's password.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.450
Now, Farouk wants Shaw dead,
so trying to claim the money

11:16.500 --> 11:18.110
should trigger a call to him.

11:18.150 --> 11:20.020
Will they think Shaw is dumb
enough to collect the money

11:20.070 --> 11:21.630
after Farouk shot him?

11:21.680 --> 11:23.720
Oh, I think we're good
on that front.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.460
[camera clicking]

11:26.510 --> 11:29.900
Yeah, let's trace a call,
get Farouk's location.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.160
It's a great plan.

11:32.210 --> 11:34.040
Did you get the password?I did.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.040
What is it? Wa enta Malak.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.080
That means
"None of your business."

11:38.130 --> 11:40.260
Does it? Hmm.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.040
DANNY:
Lexi got Shaw
to give the password

11:42.090 --> 11:43.790
just to her, uh,
he's got kind of a crush.

11:45.130 --> 11:46.570
GWEN:
Hmm.

11:46.610 --> 11:49.440
Guess we're all going to Paris.

11:49.490 --> 11:52.710
OMAR:
Farouk, as requested.

11:56.190 --> 11:58.190
Well done, Omar.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.430
Hmm.

12:18.470 --> 12:21.470
Cleopatra was taken to Germany.

12:32.140 --> 12:35.010
Soon we will have
everything we need.

12:41.230 --> 12:43.240
[music playing in distance]

12:54.940 --> 12:56.550
DANNY:
Can Shaw see us?

12:56.600 --> 12:57.640
ASIM [over radio]:
He can see.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.600
SHAW:
I cannot see. Hand over

12:59.640 --> 13:00.820
them giant-ass binoculars
you got,

13:00.860 --> 13:03.650
and maybe I can I.D. the man.

13:03.690 --> 13:05.820
Hey, don't touch.
They're very expensive.

13:05.870 --> 13:07.910
Just so you know, the way
you're treating me right now

13:07.960 --> 13:09.650
isn't good for team morale.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.440
You're not on the team.
Just I.D. the banker.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.400
Uh, could you adjust the focus?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.190
Hmm...

13:21.230 --> 13:22.750
He had a beard.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.710
GWEN:
Can you be a little bit

13:27.760 --> 13:29.020
more specific?

13:29.060 --> 13:30.370
[sighs]
Old guy,

13:30.410 --> 13:32.200
wears dark glasses, even inside.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.460
DANNY:
Copy that.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.460
Heading inside.

13:36.510 --> 13:41.510
Inside, 15 paces south,
turning west.

13:41.550 --> 13:43.560
Let me handle him.

13:51.560 --> 13:55.570
Are you the man
selling Skinjbeer?

13:55.610 --> 13:57.960
Skinjbeer.

13:59.620 --> 14:03.140
That would make you
Mr. Shaw, then, yes?

14:03.190 --> 14:06.280
That's me. Mr. Shaw.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.800
And that would make you...

14:07.840 --> 14:08.840
Eager to get on with it.

14:22.510 --> 14:23.950
Mr. Shaw,

14:23.990 --> 14:28.080
seeking remittance for
a transaction dating back to...

14:32.480 --> 14:34.000
One moment.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.700
You ready to start the trace?

14:36.740 --> 14:39.000
Agent Danny from FBI.

14:39.050 --> 14:41.180
Ooh...

14:41.220 --> 14:43.570
Agent Danny, it's me, Marwan.
You remember? From Iraq.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.050
You saved my life.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.230
This is not good.

14:46.270 --> 14:48.010
I was interpreter for his FBI.

14:48.060 --> 14:49.270
Best one they had.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.100
Danny secured exit visas
for my family.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.110
I think you have
the wrong person.Yeah, you're mistaken, friend.

14:54.150 --> 14:55.670
I-I guess I just have

14:55.720 --> 14:57.460
[chuckles]:
one of those faces.Mistaken?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.460
I named my youngest child
after you.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.030
DANNY:
Th-This is...

15:02.070 --> 15:03.290
not what it looks like.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.990
[whistles]

15:05.030 --> 15:06.510
LEXI:
This is why

15:06.550 --> 15:08.860
you should never
be nice to people.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.260
My nephews.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.170
With apologies,

15:15.210 --> 15:18.130
Agent Danny.

15:19.830 --> 15:20.870

15:28.840 --> 15:30.140

[shouts]

15:52.990 --> 15:55.910
[groaning]

16:01.690 --> 16:03.610
I think we kind of got off
on the wrong food.

16:03.650 --> 16:05.660
[doors thud][people screaming]

16:09.530 --> 16:11.700
[grunting]

16:19.190 --> 16:20.320
Ooh.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.240
[exhales]
Where's the banker?

16:26.280 --> 16:28.370
Has anyone seen Lexi?

16:31.200 --> 16:33.380
[bystanders murmuring]

16:34.420 --> 16:36.730
Get off me!

16:38.300 --> 16:40.300
[laughs]:
He's surprisingly spry.

16:41.820 --> 16:45.090
[coughing]

16:45.130 --> 16:47.130
Bloody hell.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.960
[panting]

16:56.360 --> 16:58.660
Any luck?He got away.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.140
You all right?

17:00.190 --> 17:02.710
Things got out of hand fast.

17:04.670 --> 17:06.240
Your plan almost worked.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.460
Hey, thanks for having
my back in there.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.030
Well, we would both be dead
if it wasn't for Agent Karlsson.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.550
Well, I'd feel better if we
got more for our efforts.

17:13.590 --> 17:15.070
[chuckles]:
You are so Swedish.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.860
Well, we didn't get
the phone trace,

17:16.900 --> 17:18.900
but maybe one of these nephews
will give something up.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.380
Already started
the extradition paperwork.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.640
We'll bring them back to Rome
as part

17:21.690 --> 17:22.860
of the Farouk investigation?

17:22.910 --> 17:25.820
Uh, where's Shaw?

17:25.870 --> 17:27.870
In there.

17:32.740 --> 17:34.310
[speaking Swedish]

17:35.480 --> 17:36.920
He stole my binoculars.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.100
You have to admire
the man's consistency.

17:39.140 --> 17:41.100
"Admire" is a
strong word.

17:41.140 --> 17:43.670
All right, let's wrap this up
and get back to Rome.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.100
Asim, I'm still waiting

17:45.150 --> 17:47.580
for your special assignment
paperwork from G.I.D.?

17:47.630 --> 17:49.450
I need it if you are
going to continue

17:49.500 --> 17:51.020
to work on this investigation.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.460
I'll see what the holdup is.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.250
So that old guy
really outran you?

17:58.290 --> 18:00.380
He was surprisingly spry.

18:00.420 --> 18:03.160
Huh.But I got his ledger.

18:03.210 --> 18:06.040
All the hawaladar transactions
in one place.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.300
What kind of
code is this?

18:07.340 --> 18:08.910
No idea.

18:08.950 --> 18:10.300
But it'll be worth
its weight in gold

18:10.350 --> 18:11.520
as soon as we figure it out.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.300
Interpol can help us crack it.

18:13.350 --> 18:16.610
Let's keep it between us
for now.

18:16.660 --> 18:20.010
Look, I've just...
I've been thinking.

18:20.050 --> 18:21.830
The Egyptians have now
been involved

18:21.880 --> 18:24.750
in two separate
failed operations on Farouk.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.800
You think Farouk has a mole
inside Egyptian intelligence?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.320
Remember
that capture mission,

18:28.360 --> 18:29.970
when Farouk's car
suddenly changed course

18:30.020 --> 18:31.980
and veered
into some populated area?

18:32.020 --> 18:34.500
Yeah. Asim was there.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.240
Yeah, exactly.

18:36.280 --> 18:39.370
And now he showed up
in some brand-new investigation

18:39.420 --> 18:41.160
with no
official paperwork?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.380
When it comes
to Farouk,

18:42.420 --> 18:44.250
there's no one I trust
outside of you and me.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.120
And definitely not Asim.

18:52.820 --> 18:55.130
FABI:
Really? So none of you
are going to talk, huh?

18:56.170 --> 18:58.220
Want to speak, or no?[phone chimes]

19:10.580 --> 19:13.190
Every one of them
is silent as the grave.

19:13.230 --> 19:15.580
They could teach
the mafia about omertÃ .

19:15.630 --> 19:17.150
None of these guys
are going to talk.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.540
They're not going
to betray family

19:18.590 --> 19:20.150
unless properly leveraged.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.500
I'm hoping "properly leveraged"

19:21.550 --> 19:23.240
doesn't mean
what I think it means.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.330
My point is, they should
be questioned in Egypt.

19:25.380 --> 19:27.510
Anything we get
out of them under torture

19:27.550 --> 19:29.860
is inadmissible
in court.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.600
Look, I'd, I'd like to try
talking with them.

19:33.910 --> 19:34.820
You can observe only.

19:34.860 --> 19:36.390

19:40.700 --> 19:41.960
[door closes]

19:42.000 --> 19:44.400

Geez. Ah, oh...

19:46.400 --> 19:48.230
Father Chuck.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.970
I've made some tea if you'd
like some. You look tired.

19:51.010 --> 19:55.010
I distinctly recall telling
Danny to use good judgment,

19:55.060 --> 19:57.760
and that does not include
giving you my key.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.060
You did.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.370
And he didn't.So you broke in.

20:01.410 --> 20:04.020
The lock is so flimsy, I would
barely consider it breaking in.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.680
You finding everything you need?

20:05.720 --> 20:07.330
Snack selection
was underwhelming.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.770
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.250
Well, next time you plan on
breaking in, let me know

20:10.290 --> 20:12.210
and I'll set out
a charcuterie plate.[chuckles]

20:12.250 --> 20:13.690
What is that?

20:13.730 --> 20:16.820
This is a ledger we got
from a hawaladar in Paris

20:16.860 --> 20:19.080
that has encoded transactions
with Farouk.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.820
I'm gonna need, like,
five minutes

20:20.870 --> 20:22.220
to process that sentence.

20:22.260 --> 20:23.430
Simple version:

20:23.480 --> 20:25.260
I crack this code,

20:25.310 --> 20:27.220
we get a step closer to Farouk.

20:30.310 --> 20:33.270
FATHER CHUCK:
Looks like a dead language.

20:33.310 --> 20:34.790
LEXI:Exactly what I
was thinking.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.270
Thus, I broke into
your place to access

20:36.320 --> 20:38.620
your extensive collection
of old-timey books.

20:38.670 --> 20:41.500
All right, just so
I'm keeping track.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.670
Breaking into my
apartment: bad.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.280
Trying to stop
terrorist: good.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.510
I guess, in this case, the
good outweighs the bad.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.120
So you're helping?

20:54.160 --> 20:56.510
Yeah, I mean,
I'm no Magnum P.I.,

20:56.550 --> 20:59.170
but if it's just comparing
things, I can do that.

20:59.210 --> 21:01.470
Well, I appreciate it.

21:06.090 --> 21:09.610
It's strange to me that Danny's
never mentioned you,

21:09.650 --> 21:11.310
considering how close
you two are.

21:11.350 --> 21:14.310
Well, Danny's a complicated guy.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.750
He follows rules and does
the right thing unfailingly.

21:17.790 --> 21:19.620
He's the furthest thing
from complicated.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.410
Okay.

21:21.450 --> 21:25.280
[chuckling]:
What? Am I wrong?

21:25.320 --> 21:27.800
You and Danny have a lot more
in common than you think.

21:27.850 --> 21:30.410
[laughs] How do you figure?

21:30.460 --> 21:33.330
Something tells me you're not
ready to wade into these waters.

21:33.370 --> 21:36.330
No, I don't want to talk
about me, I want dirt on Danny.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.990
Somebody here could use a drink.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.420
I think I can
handle it.

21:39.470 --> 21:41.470
I wasn't talking about you.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.340
GWEN:
Where is Karim Farouk?

21:46.390 --> 21:49.390
I'm telling you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

21:49.430 --> 21:51.440
You do realize you're
facing assault charges

21:51.480 --> 21:55.440
on law enforcement,
as well as terrorism charges,

21:55.480 --> 21:57.490
yeah?

21:58.570 --> 22:01.360
I'm not a terrorist.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.670
You are involved in
the financing of terrorists,

22:03.710 --> 22:06.360
which means there are different
rules for how we can charge you,

22:06.410 --> 22:08.370
where we can send you,
and I don't mean France.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.420
You're afraid
of him, huh?

22:14.460 --> 22:16.110
[scoffs]

22:16.160 --> 22:19.640
You should be afraid of him.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.770
He's here because
of the pyramid attack.

22:22.810 --> 22:25.380
I can turn you over to G.I.D.

22:26.990 --> 22:28.690
Tell me, Khalid,

22:28.730 --> 22:32.610
what do you think they will
do to you in Egypt, huh?

22:35.130 --> 22:37.480
What do you think
he will do to you?

22:44.710 --> 22:47.750
DANNY:
I've got an idea.
Be right back.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.450
Danny and I find a case
of sacramental wine.

22:50.490 --> 22:54.410
So the next morning, we wake up
on the floor of the sacristy,

22:54.460 --> 22:57.890
and Sister Charlene
is screaming so loud.
[laughs]

22:57.940 --> 22:59.940
I swear my ears
are still ringing.

22:59.980 --> 23:03.030
I can't picture Danny
doing any of this.Yeah, well,

23:03.070 --> 23:05.380
we got all the stupid
out of us early.

23:05.420 --> 23:07.690
Ugh, I got to lay
off this hooch.

23:07.730 --> 23:10.690
I can't tell whether this
is some ancient language

23:10.730 --> 23:14.080
or English at
this point.

23:14.130 --> 23:17.870
That is Coptic.
My mom had a bible like that.

23:17.910 --> 23:21.660
Your mom was a Coptic Christian?

23:21.700 --> 23:25.700
Dad was Muslim. I was, um,
you know, caught in the middle.

23:25.750 --> 23:28.270
That couldn't have been easy.

23:28.310 --> 23:30.620
After my mom died,
I didn't believe in any of it,

23:30.670 --> 23:32.840
so that cleared
everything right up.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.240
Out of curiosity, how old
were you when your ma died?

23:38.280 --> 23:40.940
I was eight.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.720
Is that when you
started stealing?

23:43.770 --> 23:46.640
Why?

23:46.680 --> 23:48.640
Childhood abandonment

23:48.680 --> 23:51.470
leaves a person feeling unsafe,

23:51.510 --> 23:53.860
so they assert control
however they can.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.470
You know, they see a-a thing
they want, they take it.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.170
They see a door that's
locked, they open it.

23:59.220 --> 24:03.440
It's their way of saying to the
world, "You don't control me."

24:05.530 --> 24:08.440
Doesn't sound familiar.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.100
Oh.

24:13.140 --> 24:16.450
Wait a minute, these two
languages are the same.

24:16.490 --> 24:20.280
We may have a winner.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.540
The ledger's
in Sumerian.

24:22.590 --> 24:26.330
Huh. Oh,
and with that,

24:26.370 --> 24:29.460
confession is over.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.550
What, no penance?

24:34.340 --> 24:35.600
You want penance?

24:37.210 --> 24:40.170
Don't break Danny's heart...

24:40.210 --> 24:41.430
again.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.130
[pats twice]

24:44.170 --> 24:46.180
[grunting]

24:50.480 --> 24:54.270
Gwen, can I have
a minute with him?

24:54.310 --> 24:56.320
Think it's worth a try.

24:57.490 --> 25:00.490
I'm fascinated
by the hawala system.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.800
[translating into Arabic]

25:01.840 --> 25:04.540
It's been in place
for over a thousand years,

25:04.590 --> 25:06.460
enabling trade
along the Silk Road,

25:06.500 --> 25:08.280
outlasting empires,

25:08.330 --> 25:10.550
helping give birth to the
modern financial system...

25:10.590 --> 25:12.940
[translating into Arabic]

25:12.980 --> 25:15.510
...based on nothing more
than an ironclad honor code.

25:15.550 --> 25:16.510
It's still in place,

25:16.550 --> 25:18.560
even today.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.300
Hawala means "exchange"
in Arabic,

25:21.340 --> 25:26.000
but its original meaning
is "trust" in Hindi.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.350
The whole hawala
system is built

25:28.390 --> 25:31.000
on that one word: trust.

25:31.050 --> 25:33.400
So I get

25:33.440 --> 25:36.360
why you don't want
to give us any information.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.880
I understand that we're
asking you to violate

25:38.920 --> 25:40.400
your most deeply
held beliefs...

25:42.490 --> 25:44.540
...your most sacred code.

25:45.970 --> 25:49.720
Except I'm not the one asking
you to violate anything.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.240
Karim Farouk is.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.240
Karim Farouk.
[translating into Arabic]

25:53.290 --> 25:56.590
The oil pipeline in Dakar.

25:56.640 --> 26:00.600
Office tower in Malaysia.
Airbus over the Atlantic.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.210
Countless villages
raided and ransacked.

26:03.250 --> 26:05.430
Pyramids destroyed.
Thousands of men,

26:05.470 --> 26:07.870
women, and children
murdered

26:07.910 --> 26:10.610
by a butcher who you
are now protecting.

26:10.650 --> 26:13.390
[translating
into Arabic]

26:19.750 --> 26:21.750
My uncle says...

26:23.190 --> 26:25.010
He says dealing
with undesirable customers

26:25.060 --> 26:26.410
is a part of doing business.

26:26.450 --> 26:27.670
DANNY:
Karim Farouk

26:27.710 --> 26:29.100
is demonstrably evil.

26:29.150 --> 26:32.060
How honorable is it
to protect a man without honor?

26:32.110 --> 26:35.150
What kind of code
shields a man like Farouk

26:35.200 --> 26:37.460
while leaving his future victims
without any protection?

26:37.500 --> 26:40.250
I have nothing but contempt
for men like Farouk.

26:40.290 --> 26:43.810
Men who kill and maim innocents
in the name of the Prophet.

26:43.860 --> 26:46.770
They tar us one and
all with these acts.

26:48.820 --> 26:50.340
[speaking Arabic]

27:20.070 --> 27:21.330
[speaks Arabic]

27:27.860 --> 27:29.640
I will give you
the information you need

27:29.690 --> 27:30.950
to help you in your search.

27:30.990 --> 27:32.950
[sighs]

27:32.990 --> 27:35.210
An honorable transaction

27:35.260 --> 27:37.260
with an honorable man.

27:40.090 --> 27:41.960
DANNY:
Khalid said
there have been a number

27:42.000 --> 27:43.220
of transactions.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.350
Antiquities in exchange for cash

27:45.400 --> 27:47.790
right here in Rome.GWEN:
You think that's Farouk?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.880
Think he might have
a safe house here, yeah.

27:49.920 --> 27:54.320
Unfortunately,
Khalid doesn't have the address.

27:55.930 --> 27:57.890
Control issues?

27:57.930 --> 27:59.410
Oh, Lexi.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.280
What is it?

28:01.330 --> 28:03.240
She got the address.

28:03.290 --> 28:04.590
GWEN:
From where?

28:04.630 --> 28:06.980
It's a long story, but
she's headed there now.

28:07.030 --> 28:08.680
Well, it's too late to get
a warrant. We'll check it out

28:08.730 --> 28:10.290
in the morning, no?DANNY:
I'm gonna meet her there

28:10.340 --> 28:12.640
just to be safe.Don't do anything stupid.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.780
Or, more likely, don't let her
do anything stupid.

28:15.820 --> 28:16.860
Just observe.

28:16.910 --> 28:18.650
Of course.

28:24.220 --> 28:25.700
I'm coming with you.

28:25.740 --> 28:28.270
Yeah, I'm okay on my own.
Thanks.I'm not asking.

28:28.310 --> 28:29.700
I insist.

28:38.670 --> 28:40.760
DANNY:
Lexi says this pyramid
is the location

28:40.800 --> 28:42.370
of the dead drop site.

28:42.410 --> 28:46.200
The tomb of Caius
Cestius, 12 B.C.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.980
Rome conquered Egypt,

28:48.030 --> 28:50.720
and suddenly
everything Egyptian

28:50.770 --> 28:53.640
got really fashionable
in Rome.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.470
And thus began the
Western appropriation

28:56.510 --> 28:58.510
of our cultural heritage.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.210
Well, if the exchanges
happened here,

29:03.260 --> 29:05.220
the safe house would be
nearby to monitor them.

29:05.260 --> 29:06.780
DANNY:
Lots of decent options,

29:06.830 --> 29:09.130
all with a clear view
of this square.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.440
That's too obvious.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.010
There's no clear
line of sight.

29:17.140 --> 29:19.140
It should be one of those.

29:20.580 --> 29:22.630
Hey, maybe you could,
uh, wait here

29:22.670 --> 29:24.760
in case Lexi shows up.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.060
Why are you always
trying to lose me?

29:27.110 --> 29:29.150
I know you well enough
not to suspect you

29:29.200 --> 29:31.160
of working for Farouk...

29:31.200 --> 29:33.420
which means you suspect me.

29:34.460 --> 29:36.770
Just being cautious.

29:50.260 --> 29:52.260
Spotting a pair
of strangers below.

29:52.310 --> 29:55.180
Looks like they're trying
to make our location.

29:55.220 --> 29:56.440
Orders?

29:56.490 --> 29:57.970
OMAR [over radio]:
Describe them.

29:58.010 --> 30:00.490
One Arab, one Yankee.
Both reek of cop.

30:00.530 --> 30:01.880
If they make a move,

30:01.930 --> 30:03.230
take them out.

30:03.270 --> 30:04.930
Copy that.

30:08.060 --> 30:10.760
Your special assignment
paperwork ever come through?

30:14.290 --> 30:17.030
Are you even supposed
to be here?

30:17.070 --> 30:19.290
No. I'm not.

30:20.940 --> 30:22.730
That day we had Farouk
in our sights...

30:22.770 --> 30:25.210
he veered off course
so quickly.

30:25.250 --> 30:28.210
I think someone
warned him.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.430
You think someone in
the Egyptian government?

30:30.480 --> 30:32.830
Yes.

30:32.870 --> 30:35.310
Look, as angry as you might be
about what happened then

30:35.350 --> 30:37.530
and what happened
at the pyramids,

30:37.570 --> 30:39.620
imagine how I feel

30:39.660 --> 30:42.880
when it's happening
in my own country.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.140
I know what you're thinking.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.540
If I am the mole,

30:46.580 --> 30:48.580
it's a good play for me
to accuse someone else.

30:50.930 --> 30:52.930
I know why
you wouldn't trust me.

30:54.330 --> 30:58.460
But every time
I get close to him...

30:58.500 --> 31:00.980
I hit a wall.

31:02.810 --> 31:04.950
There's no way
I can do this on my own.

31:04.990 --> 31:08.170
And there's no one I trust more
to have my back.

31:10.860 --> 31:12.130
All right.

31:12.170 --> 31:15.040
Let's go in, get
the lay of the land.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.390
Maybe ask some questions.

31:21.220 --> 31:22.700
In case we don't like
the answers.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.530
LEXI:
Farouk's safe house!

Asim!
I'll call in.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.440

Please stay with us.

You...

32:55.010 --> 32:57.100
finish this.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.450

32:59.490 --> 33:01.500
I promise.

33:04.890 --> 33:06.460

33:07.460 --> 33:09.420
I will.

cheaters from St. Luke's.

12-year-olds with mustaches.

Oh!

34:50.080 --> 34:51.350
Ouch!

Oh, that hurts
on so many levels.

they're leaving me no choice.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.090
Yeah. You even
asked nicely.

Are you ready
for the pain?

35:14.190 --> 35:17.150

over the plate, Wild Thing.

35:33.170 --> 35:35.130
All right,

35:35.170 --> 35:36.870
Maybe this one'll shut you up.

Hey, listen, um...

35:47.490 --> 35:49.270
Listen, I was thinking.

35:51.320 --> 35:53.760
Why don't you stay with me
in Rome a little while longer?

35:53.800 --> 35:56.370
Yeah?Yeah.

35:56.410 --> 35:59.240
I'll even let your
grifter girlfriend visit.

Look,

36:10.690 --> 36:12.300
I don't know what she is.

36:12.340 --> 36:13.780
All I know is...

36:13.820 --> 36:17.210
somebody's got to stop this guy,
and I can't do it alone.

36:17.260 --> 36:20.560
And she's gonna try
and do it herself anyway,

36:20.610 --> 36:22.650
and she's gonna get hurt.

36:22.700 --> 36:27.790
And if anything happened
to her, I don't know, I...

36:27.830 --> 36:29.180
Wait. What?

36:32.050 --> 36:34.750
Not cool.
Not cool.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.800
I'm going to, uh...

I'm gonna go

36:43.150 --> 36:45.290
[laughs airily]

36:45.330 --> 36:47.200
How are you?

36:47.240 --> 36:50.290
Well, I got to remember
to keep my elbow up.

36:50.330 --> 36:51.900
You know, swing through the ball
a little bit more.

36:51.940 --> 36:53.420
I meant about today.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.820
I know.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.390
I was wrong.

37:00.430 --> 37:02.390
I feel...

37:02.430 --> 37:05.480
terrible about suspecting Asim.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.220
He was just trying to
stop Farouk, same as us.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.140
He didn't die in vain.

37:10.180 --> 37:14.270
I mean, finding one of Farouk's
safe houses is a big deal.

37:14.310 --> 37:16.490
It'll force him
to alter his plans.

37:16.530 --> 37:19.280
He'll start making mistakes.How do you know?

37:19.320 --> 37:21.280
That's how I found him
the first time.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.320
This should also help.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.590
Where did you get this?

37:29.630 --> 37:31.290
Farouk's safe house.

37:31.330 --> 37:33.070
Grabbed it at
the firefight.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.810
"Bavaria, 1944."

37:35.860 --> 37:38.510
The Nazis got Cleopatra
to Germany.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.470
Look, I've been thinking.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.690
Asim said something before
we breached the safe house

37:46.740 --> 37:51.130
about Egyptian culture
being appropriated by the West.

37:51.180 --> 37:53.700
Now the same goes
for Cleopatra and Antony.

37:53.740 --> 37:55.660
They were a symbol for both.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.180
But their union led to a war
between East and West,

37:58.230 --> 38:01.100
and ultimately brought down
the Egyptian dynasty.

38:01.140 --> 38:05.280
Now, Farouk's attacks always
have an element of symbolism.

38:05.320 --> 38:08.590
Maybe reuniting them is all part
of a plan to drive East and West

38:08.630 --> 38:10.410
into an all-out war.

38:10.460 --> 38:12.070
Farouk went to a lot of effort

38:12.110 --> 38:13.590
to get that photograph.

38:13.630 --> 38:15.810
He's gonna go to
wherever it was taken.Yeah.

38:15.850 --> 38:18.330
Narrowing it down will take
some work, but we'll find it.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.380
We'll find him.

38:20.420 --> 38:23.340
Danny, don't
worry about me.

38:23.380 --> 38:25.340
This time I'll be ready.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.870
Yeah.

38:34.260 --> 38:36.270
Wh-When you texted me before,

38:36.310 --> 38:37.530
you said something about...

38:37.570 --> 38:39.220
not having control issues?

38:39.270 --> 38:41.230
What-what was that?

38:41.270 --> 38:43.360
Stupid Chuck.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.360
He's all in my head now.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.190
He says we have control issues.

38:47.230 --> 38:48.410
Both of us.

38:48.450 --> 38:50.190
Chuck thinks a lot of things.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.460
Did he tell you
his theory on Amelia Earhart?

38:52.500 --> 38:55.200
MAN [over phone]:
Fabi, was it Asim Masood?

38:55.240 --> 38:57.030
Masood was not
the mole in Egypt.

38:57.070 --> 38:59.070
There's only one option left.

39:00.420 --> 39:04.290
They're on their way to Germany,
as is Farouk.

39:04.340 --> 39:06.950
We'll be ready,
whoever finds her.
