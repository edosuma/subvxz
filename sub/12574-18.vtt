00:31.219 --> 00:32.353
Lord Rahl.

00:32.354 --> 00:35.122
Have you brought
what I asked for?

00:35.123 --> 00:38.325
The Scroll of Valdaire.

00:40.428 --> 00:41.929
Did the Seeker read it?

00:41.930 --> 00:44.565
I took it from him
before he could break the seal.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.834
Then he still has no idea
what to do

00:46.835 --> 00:48.869
with the Stone of Tears
when he finds it.

00:48.870 --> 00:51.405
And he never will.

00:51.406 --> 00:53.140
No!

00:53.141 --> 00:55.142
Do not destroy it.

00:55.143 --> 00:57.711
It is the Keeper's will
that you take the scroll

00:57.712 --> 00:59.880
to the Mord-Sith temple
at Jandralyn,

00:59.881 --> 01:03.717
without breaking the seal.

01:03.718 --> 01:07.655
They will deliver it into
my hands, and my hands only.

01:07.656 --> 01:11.125
In the World of the Living, you
are nothing more than a spirit.

01:11.126 --> 01:13.427
Into what hands
am I to deliver it?

01:13.428 --> 01:15.296
If I were you, Marianna,
I would worry more

01:15.297 --> 01:17.565
about making sure that
the Seeker does not kill you

01:17.566 --> 01:19.533
and take the scroll
bere you reach Jandralyn.

01:19.534 --> 01:23.971
Because I am quite certain
that my intrepid brother Richard

01:23.972 --> 01:26.640
is already on your trail.

01:28.743 --> 01:30.477
Her tracks lead that way,

01:30.478 --> 01:32.046
but they're at least
a half a day old.

01:32.047 --> 01:33.514
We have to pick up our pace.

01:33.515 --> 01:35.783
Fortune has smiled upon us.

01:35.784 --> 01:38.385
A Sister of the Dark
has escaped with the scroll,

01:38.386 --> 01:41.222
she's hours ahead,
and you call that fortunate?

01:41.223 --> 01:42.623
Can't you smell that?

01:42.624 --> 01:44.825
Smell what? Pine trees?

01:44.826 --> 01:47.127
Lamb, butter, a touch of fennel.

01:47.128 --> 01:49.597
And there it is, on the wind,
the sound of distant laughter.

01:49.598 --> 01:51.665
Leads me to conclude
we're fast approaching

01:51.666 --> 01:54.835
a roadside tavern, and the balm
of all weary travelers.

01:54.836 --> 01:56.470
We don't have time
to feed your belly.

01:56.471 --> 01:57.938
None of us have eaten in days.

01:57.939 --> 02:00.241
We'll all move a lot faster
once we're fortified,

02:00.242 --> 02:01.742
and I'm certain
the good tavern keeper

02:01.743 --> 02:04.712
will be more than happy to pack
up our victuals for the road.

02:04.713 --> 02:06.380
<i>Compliments of the house.</i>

02:06.381 --> 02:07.915
Oh, no, please,
let us pay you.

02:07.916 --> 02:10.150
After all you and your friends
have done for the Midlands?

02:10.151 --> 02:12.419
Let me express my gratitude
in what little way I can.

02:12.420 --> 02:15.422
Thank you, sir.
May the Spirits watch over you.

02:18.293 --> 02:19.426
To the Seeker!

02:19.427 --> 02:21.562
To the Seeker!

02:21.563 --> 02:24.531
Yes, to the Seeker.

02:25.867 --> 02:28.802
May he burn brightly
in the fires of the Underworld.

02:28.803 --> 02:32.106
I don't think
I heard you right, sir.

02:32.107 --> 02:34.241
No, you heard me.
Damn the Seeker,

02:34.242 --> 02:36.543
and all the fools who helped him
bring down Darken Rahl.

02:36.544 --> 02:38.712
Darken Rahl
was a wicked tyrant.

02:38.713 --> 02:40.681
Oh, I'll grant you that.

02:40.682 --> 02:43.517
He'd conscript your sons,
violate your daughters,

02:43.518 --> 02:45.286
lock you up
for looking at him funny.

02:45.287 --> 02:47.955
But at least when he was around
we had order.

02:47.956 --> 02:49.757
Nowadays, if the highwaymen
don't get you,

02:49.758 --> 02:51.125
the banelings will.

02:51.126 --> 02:54.361
May the Creator forgive me,
I miss the good old days.

02:54.362 --> 02:56.530
To the good old days!

02:58.133 --> 03:03.070
Well, there's at least one other
sensible man in this province.

03:05.340 --> 03:07.408
I once came damnably close

03:07.409 --> 03:09.009
to bringing back
those good old days.

03:09.010 --> 03:13.380
To returning Darken Rahl to his
rightful place among the living.

03:13.381 --> 03:14.882
Sounds like quite a story.

03:14.883 --> 03:16.617
Oh, Oh, that it is, my friend.

03:16.618 --> 03:18.052
And I'd be happy to tell it,

03:18.053 --> 03:21.488
if, uh, ahem, my damn throat
weren't so dry.

03:23.091 --> 03:26.660
Two tankards of your best,
barkeep.

03:30.432 --> 03:32.733
You promised me a tale.

03:32.734 --> 03:33.968
That I did.

03:33.969 --> 03:36.503
But I assure you,
it is no tale, my friend.

03:36.504 --> 03:39.173
It is the Creator's
honest truth.

03:39.174 --> 03:43.978
It all started
in a flea-bitten backwater

03:43.979 --> 03:45.746
by the name of Sheephaven,

03:45.747 --> 03:49.116
back when Darken Rahl
was still in power.

03:52.187 --> 03:54.321
<i>One of the locals</i>
<i>had found a way</i>

03:54.322 --> 03:56.457
<i>to profit from</i>
<i>the general hatred for Rahl.</i>

03:56.458 --> 03:59.026
Step right up,
ladies and gentleman.

03:59.027 --> 04:02.496
Give the villain who is
the cause of all your suffering

04:02.497 --> 04:04.531
the tribute he deserves!

04:05.934 --> 04:07.668
Three tries
for a farthing.

04:07.669 --> 04:09.503
Mm-hm.

04:12.474 --> 04:15.309
D'Harans! Real ones!

04:18.680 --> 04:20.147
Aah!

04:26.988 --> 04:29.289
No! Please don't kill me!

04:29.290 --> 04:31.291
I'm just some poor sod
trying to make a living,

04:31.292 --> 04:32.526
I didn't mean any offense.

04:33.928 --> 04:35.696
You're quite famous.
Do you know that?

04:35.697 --> 04:38.766
Word of your unique talent
has reached the ears

04:38.767 --> 04:41.368
of the true Lord Rahl.

04:41.369 --> 04:44.071
He'd like to meet you
personally.

04:47.042 --> 04:48.742
Think of it, Lord Rahl.

04:48.743 --> 04:52.346
He could appear in your stead
at ceremonial obligations

04:52.347 --> 04:55.015
that interfere with more
pressing affairs of state.

04:55.016 --> 04:58.352
He could serve as a convincing
decoy to would-be assassins.

04:58.353 --> 04:59.686
Hm.

05:01.556 --> 05:03.924
Very impressive,
Captain Malray.

05:03.925 --> 05:05.826
Thank you, Lord Rahl.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.162
Very impressive indeed.

05:08.163 --> 05:11.098
He is the very image of me.

05:11.099 --> 05:13.300
Were I to have a belly
the size of West Granthia,

05:13.301 --> 05:14.601
a nose trampled by a horse,

05:14.602 --> 05:18.372
and hair the color
of mouse droppings.

05:19.908 --> 05:21.909
Perhaps a year spent
breaking stones

05:21.910 --> 05:23.677
in the quarries of Groth

05:23.678 --> 05:25.579
will improve your powers
of perception.

05:25.580 --> 05:26.947
As for him,

05:26.948 --> 05:28.949
feed him to dogs, before my
enemies find use for him.

05:28.950 --> 05:31.585
Lord Rahl--
We are finished here, captain.

05:31.586 --> 05:32.920
Humbly,
respectfully, sir,

05:32.921 --> 05:34.855
I brought this man here

05:34.856 --> 05:36.390
not as the finished
work of art,

05:36.391 --> 05:39.093
but as the raw clay
from which it would be sculpted.

05:39.094 --> 05:42.663
If you would only let me show
you the wonders I can work,

05:42.664 --> 05:44.098
you will not be disappointed.

05:46.468 --> 05:47.835
What do you think, Egremont?

05:47.836 --> 05:50.637
I !gree withou of course,
My Lord.

05:50.638 --> 05:52.372
This rogue doesn't have
the slightest trace

05:52.373 --> 05:54.775
of your natural radiance
or nobility.

05:54.776 --> 05:58.345
But if he could be improved
upon, as Captain Malray claims,

05:58.346 --> 06:00.147
he may be of some use.

06:00.148 --> 06:03.350
One day, you may have the need
to convince an adversary

06:03.351 --> 06:04.985
that you were dead.

06:04.986 --> 06:07.654
He would at least make
a convincing enough corpse.

06:09.624 --> 06:11.692
The man is the height
of a toadstool.

06:11.693 --> 06:14.027
What do you intend to do,
put him on stilts?

06:18.800 --> 06:20.534
Please!

06:20.535 --> 06:24.738
I'm tall enough now.
I swear I am.

06:28.776 --> 06:30.544
Thank the Spirits.

06:30.545 --> 06:32.880
Hm.

06:32.881 --> 06:34.715
Two finger-lengths more.

06:34.716 --> 06:35.716
What?

06:35.717 --> 06:37.551
Just close your eyes, Walter,

06:37.552 --> 06:39.620
and imagine yourself
by the sea.

06:39.621 --> 06:41.121
No.

06:42.891 --> 06:46.593
<i>And in time, we solved the</i>
<i>problem of Walter's stature</i>

06:46.594 --> 06:48.929
<i>and colored that hideous hair.</i>

06:48.930 --> 06:52.399
<i>But there was still a great</i>
<i>deal of work to be done.</i>

06:52.400 --> 06:54.935
Coming along. Hm?

06:54.936 --> 06:57.571
Though I still don't see
a way around that nose.

06:57.572 --> 07:01.175
Oh. It happened the first time
I was mistaken for Rahl.

07:01.176 --> 07:04.244
This drunk took a swing at me
and knocked it out of joint.

07:04.245 --> 07:05.879
When I'm entertaining,

07:05.880 --> 07:07.714
I just shade it with
a little bit of charcoal

07:07.715 --> 07:09.016
and the crowd
is none the wiser.

07:09.017 --> 07:11.818
Well, that might fool
some provincial bumpkins.

07:11.819 --> 07:14.054
But if you're going to be
of any use to Lord Rahl,

07:14.055 --> 07:17.124
you will need to convince even
those who know him personally.

07:17.125 --> 07:19.092
Oh, no,
I have seen wonders done

07:19.093 --> 07:20.994
with a little plaster
of gypsum and honey

07:20.995 --> 07:23.964
in the concealment
of unsightly features.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.934
Mm.
There's no need for that.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.476
Perfect.

07:36.477 --> 07:39.213
"P-People of D'Hara,

07:39.214 --> 07:43.984
"a-as we march proudly
into the dawn of a new era,

07:43.985 --> 07:46.253
united by faith in our cause--"

07:46.254 --> 07:48.188
Stop,
before my ears bleed.

07:48.189 --> 07:50.824
If people hear that, they'll
know they're being deceived.

07:50.825 --> 07:54.061
And if that happens, Lord Rahl
will order all of our heads

07:54.062 --> 07:56.897
to grace the pikes
at the palace gates!

07:56.898 --> 07:58.465
General.

07:58.466 --> 08:00.667
Walter doesn't need to say
anything at all.

08:00.668 --> 08:03.737
All he needs to do is stand
on the balcony, act the part,

08:03.738 --> 08:06.139
and give the crowd
the renowned Lord Rahl wave.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.208
Go on, Walter,
show the General how beautifully

08:08.209 --> 08:09.576
you've mastered the wave.

08:17.885 --> 08:20.320
Now if you really want to be
the one to interrupt

08:20.321 --> 08:23.824
Lord Rahl's revelry to inform
him that he needs to come here

08:23.825 --> 08:27.995
to lead those dreary devotions,
go right ahead.

08:30.999 --> 08:32.232
Very well.

08:32.232 --> 08:33.967
Make your appearance.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.602
And may the Spirits
be with us all.

09:19.747 --> 09:22.516
<i>And in time, under my tutelage,</i>

09:22.517 --> 09:25.952
<i>Walter eventually mastered</i>
<i>the accent as well.</i>

09:25.953 --> 09:28.388
We became great friends,
Walter and I.

09:28.389 --> 09:30.590
And the gold we were paid
for our service,

09:30.591 --> 09:33.994
well, that financed
many a debauch. Yes.

09:33.995 --> 09:36.730
We'd come a long way
from the day I found him

09:36.731 --> 09:39.499
on the filthy streets
of Sheephaven. Heh.

09:39.500 --> 09:43.704
But alas, those good old days
were few in number.

09:43.705 --> 09:47.140
And when the cursed Seeker
put an end to our patron, well,

09:47.141 --> 09:50.277
the palace fell into ruin,

09:50.278 --> 09:53.580
<i>and was soon overrun</i>
<i>by an angry mob</i>

09:53.581 --> 09:56.249
<i>hungry for loot and revenge.</i>

09:58.286 --> 10:01.421
Take that down.

10:02.824 --> 10:05.692
Look! It's the tyrant,
Darken Rahl!

10:05.693 --> 10:07.094
He's not dead after all!

10:07.095 --> 10:08.862
Darken Rahl is dead.

10:08.863 --> 10:10.997
And the Seeker killed him,
I'm just his double.

10:10.998 --> 10:13.500
How do we know the one who died
wasn't a double,

10:13.501 --> 10:15.869
and you're not the real
Darken Rahl?

10:15.870 --> 10:17.704
Yeah!

10:25.012 --> 10:27.681
Malray!

10:27.682 --> 10:29.449
Bless you, old friend!

10:29.450 --> 10:30.917
Get him!

10:32.653 --> 10:36.123
<i>And then the mob</i>
<i>swept him away.</i>

10:36.124 --> 10:38.125
And you never saw him again?

10:38.126 --> 10:40.727
Oh, no, no, no.
I saw him again.

10:40.728 --> 10:43.063
I've only told you
the beginning of the story.

10:43.064 --> 10:47.100
Still ahead of us
lay the treasure, the blood,

10:47.101 --> 10:51.204
the betrayals,
and most of all the women.

10:51.205 --> 10:53.373
Well don't stop there, man.
Go on!

10:53.374 --> 10:57.010
Ah, that, my friend, would
require another tankard of ale.

11:02.205 --> 11:04.072
After the fall of Darken Rahl,

11:04.073 --> 11:06.074
it was hard
for a D'Haran officer.

11:06.075 --> 11:09.177
No more wages,
no more plunder.

11:09.178 --> 11:11.613
No more pillage.

11:11.614 --> 11:14.916
But I had a plan
to restore my fortunes.

11:14.917 --> 11:18.486
But to do that required finding
my old friend Walter again.

11:18.487 --> 11:19.788
How did you manage it?

11:19.789 --> 11:22.290
Well, I knew he had a taste
for stout ale,

11:22.291 --> 11:24.860
so I searched
all the taverns in D'Hara.

11:24.861 --> 11:27.262
It seemed hopeless,
until one night,

11:27.263 --> 11:30.765
<i>I walked into the very</i>
<i>watering hole</i>

11:30.766 --> 11:35.737
<i>where we are sitting</i>
<i>at this very moment.</i>

11:35.738 --> 11:38.473
Thought you could slip me
a lead farthing, did you?

11:38.474 --> 11:40.876
No, I thought they
were copper, I swear to you.

11:40.877 --> 11:42.410
I'm the one
who's been cheated here.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.946
You rotten,
lying scoundrel!

11:47.617 --> 11:50.085
The tyrant lives!

11:50.086 --> 11:51.253
Walter.

11:54.223 --> 11:59.928
Anyone who wants a taste of him
gets a taste of me too.

11:59.929 --> 12:01.329
Go on.

12:13.876 --> 12:17.679
Malray. Old friend.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.781
It's good to see you again,
Walter.

12:21.183 --> 12:24.019
This is the second time
you've saved my skin.

12:24.020 --> 12:26.621
I just wish you could help me
wriggle out of it.

12:27.924 --> 12:29.891
I wish I looked
like someone else.

12:29.892 --> 12:32.594
Walter, it's how you look that's
going to be our salvation.

12:32.595 --> 12:35.363
All you have to do
is convince a few Mord-Sith

12:35.364 --> 12:36.698
that you're the true
Darken Rahl.

12:36.699 --> 12:38.533
Mord-Sith?
Are you out of your mind?

12:38.534 --> 12:40.368
The good sisters
at the temple of Jandralyn

12:40.369 --> 12:41.736
are protecting
a hoard of treasure

12:41.737 --> 12:43.038
stashed there by Darken Rahl.

12:43.039 --> 12:45.240
Now, when their true lord
and master

12:45.241 --> 12:46.641
orders them to return it,

12:46.642 --> 12:50.178
we will have enough gold to last
us the rest of our lives.

12:50.179 --> 12:51.680
Do you have any idea

12:51.681 --> 12:55.717
what those women can do
to men with the--

12:55.718 --> 12:57.485
The torture sticks
they carry?

12:57.486 --> 13:00.021
They would never dream
of using those torture sticks

13:00.022 --> 13:01.556
against their one true lord
and master.

13:01.557 --> 13:02.657
Which I am not.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.327
And we would have to get
close to them,

13:05.328 --> 13:07.562
and then they would know.
Walter.

13:07.563 --> 13:10.065
Just close your eyes

13:10.066 --> 13:13.802
and imagine yourself
by the sea.

13:13.803 --> 13:15.837
The last time you told me
to do that,

13:15.838 --> 13:18.606
my shoulders were nearly
pulled from their sockets.

13:18.607 --> 13:20.308
Yeah, but this time I mean it,
Walter.

13:20.309 --> 13:24.412
We'll get the treasure, and
then we'll sail to Merilandria,

13:24.413 --> 13:27.482
and we'll ljve
a life of ease

13:27.483 --> 13:29.217
by the shimmering ocean,

13:29.218 --> 13:32.420
strolling on
the golden sands,

13:32.421 --> 13:36.424
a different woman every night.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.595
I'd be happy with just one.

13:40.596 --> 13:41.696
If she were the right girl.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.765
Then we'll find you
the right girl.

13:43.766 --> 13:47.736
But first,
we need the treasure.

13:47.737 --> 13:49.604
What do you say?

13:50.773 --> 13:53.908
Lord Rahl, it's true...

13:55.845 --> 13:57.612
you are still alive.

14:00.349 --> 14:03.918
Arise,
Sisters of the Agiel.

14:07.456 --> 14:09.557
How may we serve you, My Lord?

14:09.558 --> 14:11.960
I've come for my treasure.

14:11.961 --> 14:14.162
At once, My Lord.

14:14.163 --> 14:18.299
But first, Lord Rahl and I
would require a meal,

14:18.300 --> 14:21.236
and a hot bath.

14:21.237 --> 14:23.338
Lord Rahl is weary
from his travels,

14:23.339 --> 14:26.708
and wishes to indulge
in those particular pleasures

14:26.709 --> 14:31.246
which only the skills
of his Mord-Sith can provide.

14:31.247 --> 14:33.648
Of course, Captain Malray.

14:33.649 --> 14:36.317
Immediately.

14:36.318 --> 14:38.319
Why are you standing there?

14:38.320 --> 14:41.289
Are you as deaf
as you are stupid?

14:41.290 --> 14:44.492
No, mistress.
I'll see to the bath at once.

14:44.493 --> 14:46.361
And supper. Now.

14:46.362 --> 14:48.229
Yes, mistress.

15:02.478 --> 15:05.246
I don't think we should delay
our departure much longer,

15:05.247 --> 15:06.748
Captain Malray.

15:06.749 --> 15:10.452
After all, the future
of D'Hara is at stake.

15:10.453 --> 15:14.255
Your devotion to duty is
admirable as always, Lord Rahl.

15:14.256 --> 15:18.460
But I beg you for once
to think of yourself.

15:18.461 --> 15:21.029
After the hardships
of the past months,

15:21.030 --> 15:23.598
you deserve one night
of pleasure.

15:30.739 --> 15:33.108
How dare a lowly slave

15:33.109 --> 15:35.076
look directly into the eyes
of Lord Rahl.

15:35.077 --> 15:37.178
Don't!

15:41.083 --> 15:42.317
My Lord?

15:42.318 --> 15:46.421
You will treat
the slave gently,

15:46.422 --> 15:49.390
or you will feel the sting
of my wrath.

15:50.759 --> 15:52.360
Yes, My Lord.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.408
Are you trying
to get us killed?

16:07.409 --> 16:10.512
The real Lord Rahl would never
show kindness to a slave.

16:10.513 --> 16:12.147
They were being so cruel.

16:12.148 --> 16:14.716
And how cruel are they going
to be to us if we're discovered,

16:14.717 --> 16:16.351
you idiot?

16:16.352 --> 16:18.753
I am the one who said
we should get out of here.

16:18.754 --> 16:20.221
If we try and leave now,

16:20.222 --> 16:23.491
before Lord Rahl indulges
in his famous appetites,

16:23.492 --> 16:26.161
they'll get suspicious.

16:27.530 --> 16:31.499
Lord Rahl,
your bedchamber is in readiness.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.468
May I show you there personally?

16:33.469 --> 16:36.237
Um...

16:38.274 --> 16:42.010
I have affairs of state
to attend to.

16:42.011 --> 16:44.312
But I command you to show
Captain Malray here

16:44.313 --> 16:47.882
to his bedchamber.

16:47.883 --> 16:51.119
And do not fail to extend to him
every courtesy

16:51.120 --> 16:53.488
you would extend to me.

16:53.489 --> 16:56.291
As you command, My Lord.

16:56.292 --> 17:00.061
I will fetch you a robe,
captain.

17:01.797 --> 17:03.898
Walter.
Hm?

17:03.899 --> 17:08.069
You are the best friend
a man has ever had.

17:08.069 --> 17:11.873
The night that Walter and I
spent in that temple

17:11.874 --> 17:15.009
was nearly worth all the trouble
that came after.

17:15.010 --> 17:17.377
Nearly.

17:19.848 --> 17:22.884
I assure you, My Lord,
the treasure has gone untouched

17:22.885 --> 17:24.551
since you entrusted it
to our care.

17:24.553 --> 17:25.553
Good.

17:36.599 --> 17:39.200
Load it onto the wagon.
At once.

17:39.201 --> 17:42.036
Must you leave us so soon,
My Lord?

17:42.037 --> 17:43.871
I have many enemies
in the Midlands.

17:43.872 --> 17:46.307
More than we can fight
at present.

17:46.308 --> 17:48.476
So I will sail
to the Lands of the South

17:48.477 --> 17:50.712
where I will use the treasure
to raise a mercenary army

17:50.713 --> 17:53.915
with which to return
to re-conquer D'Hara.

17:53.916 --> 17:56.417
A wise plan, My Lord.

17:56.418 --> 17:59.087
You and your sisters
will provide us with an escort

17:59.088 --> 18:01.022
to see us safely to the port.

18:09.965 --> 18:13.735
<i>Our real plan was to catch</i>
<i>a boat to Merilandria,</i>

18:13.736 --> 18:15.169
<i>but I knew we needed protection</i>

18:15.170 --> 18:16.904
<i>to get us past</i>
<i>the marauders and the bandits</i>

18:16.905 --> 18:18.306
<i>of the Iron Mountains.</i>

18:18.307 --> 18:20.575
<i>And we almost made it...</i>
Halt!

18:20.576 --> 18:22.043
<i>...if it hadn't been</i>
<i>for the meddling</i>

18:22.044 --> 18:23.945
<i>of those Mord-Sith wenches.</i>

18:23.946 --> 18:27.782
Lord Rahl, it is your most
trusted officer,

18:27.783 --> 18:30.051
General Egremont.

18:31.553 --> 18:34.455
<i>It was the one man</i>
<i>in the entire world</i>

18:34.456 --> 18:37.959
<i>we knew</i>
<i>we couldn't possibly deceive.</i>

18:44.336 --> 18:45.970
What is he doing here?

18:45.971 --> 18:47.772
We sent word to him,
My Lord.

18:47.773 --> 18:49.440
You will need all the swords
you can get

18:49.441 --> 18:51.442
if you are to restore
the glory of D'Hara.

18:51.443 --> 18:53.244
Are you a fool?

18:53.245 --> 18:55.313
Do you not know
that Lord Egremont is a traitor?

18:55.314 --> 18:57.849
He tried to usurp the throne.
Yes.

18:57.850 --> 19:00.685
I had no idea.
Please, Lord Rahl, forgive me.

19:00.686 --> 19:02.453
Your only hope of forgiveness
from Lord Rahl

19:02.454 --> 19:05.923
is the death of Egremont and all
his nefarious followers.

19:05.924 --> 19:08.693
Order yours sisters to attack,

19:08.694 --> 19:10.394
before he slaughters us all.

19:10.395 --> 19:12.063
You heard Lord Rahl!

19:12.064 --> 19:15.433
Destroy them!

19:27.946 --> 19:30.815
<i>When the life went out</i>
<i>of that first Mord-Sith...</i>

19:32.885 --> 19:36.287
<i>I knew our troubles</i>
<i>had only begun.</i>

19:36.288 --> 19:38.022
What do you mean?

19:38.023 --> 19:39.457
Well, she was dead, man.

19:39.458 --> 19:42.526
Her soul was travelling down
to the Underworld.

19:42.527 --> 19:44.896
Imagine her surprise
when she finds herself

19:44.897 --> 19:48.833
in that fiery pit of anguish,
facing the real Lord Rahl.

19:48.834 --> 19:51.269
And imagine his displeasure

19:51.270 --> 19:54.372
when he's told
by his faithful Mord-Sith

19:54.373 --> 19:57.541
that some impostor is making off
with his gold.

20:06.585 --> 20:09.687
<i>I fought bravely</i>
<i>at Walter's side,</i>

20:09.688 --> 20:12.456
<i>but we were overcome.</i>

20:15.327 --> 20:16.427
Why did you attack us?

20:16.428 --> 20:19.397
Lord Rahl commanded me.

20:19.398 --> 20:21.866
Lord Rahl is dead!

20:25.637 --> 20:28.472
So I can only conclude
that man's an imposter,

20:28.473 --> 20:32.043
a double
once in Lord Rahl's employ.

20:35.981 --> 20:39.250
You will beg my forgiveness for
your impertinence, Egremont.

20:39.251 --> 20:42.820
Or you and all your men will pay
for it with your sorry lives.

20:44.423 --> 20:45.856
Gladly.

20:45.857 --> 20:49.226
If you can prove that you are
indeed the true Lord Rahl.

20:49.227 --> 20:50.761
Which you can do
by telling me

20:50.762 --> 20:53.597
what was the chief entertainment
at the fateful birthday party

20:53.598 --> 20:56.300
of Princess Violet
of Tamarang?

21:00.305 --> 21:01.739
A clown.

21:01.740 --> 21:05.042
No, Walter.

21:05.043 --> 21:07.411
It was a puppeteer.

21:07.412 --> 21:09.747
You have been deceived.

21:09.748 --> 21:13.050
Um... No. No, no.

21:13.051 --> 21:14.352
You know-- Oh! Aah!

21:17.689 --> 21:19.690
No.

21:19.691 --> 21:21.959
Do not kill him.

21:23.395 --> 21:26.063
My Lord,
he was impersonating you,

21:26.064 --> 21:27.231
and stealing your gold.

21:27.232 --> 21:29.867
Yes, so I've just been informed

21:29.868 --> 21:33.604
by a recently dead
Sister of the Agiel.

21:33.605 --> 21:36.040
But this charlatan
was useful to me in life,

21:36.041 --> 21:39.844
and may one day
be useful to me in death.

21:39.845 --> 21:41.979
Throw him
in your dungeon,

21:41.980 --> 21:43.948
but maintain his appearance

21:43.949 --> 21:48.019
in case I have need of his
services in the future.

21:48.020 --> 21:50.087
Stay at the temple
with your men.

21:50.088 --> 21:53.724
Guard him with your life,
until I appear to you again.

21:55.594 --> 21:57.828
No, please-- Aah!

22:01.033 --> 22:03.334
<i>That was nearly</i>
<i>half a year ago.</i>

22:03.335 --> 22:09.774
I haven't seen
poor Walter since.

22:09.775 --> 22:14.178
No doubt rotting in that
Mord-Sith dungeon as we speak.

22:15.547 --> 22:18.182
<i>Here's to you, Walter.</i>

22:32.364 --> 22:34.465
I don't understand it.

22:34.466 --> 22:36.634
We should have
caught up to her by now.

22:36.635 --> 22:38.602
Maybe we have.

23:26.518 --> 23:28.819
Zedd.

23:39.664 --> 23:41.398
Command me, Confessor.

23:41.399 --> 23:42.500
Remove the dacra.

23:49.241 --> 23:51.909
Oh. Oh, thank you, Kahlan.

23:53.278 --> 23:55.513
The Scroll of Valdaire.
Do you know where it is?

23:55.514 --> 23:56.847
Answer him.

23:56.848 --> 23:58.015
Forgive me, Confessor.

23:58.016 --> 24:00.351
I don't know anything
about a scroll.

24:01.653 --> 24:03.988
A Sister of the Dark took
something very valuable

24:03.989 --> 24:06.757
from the Seeker and ran off.
Where is she?

24:06.758 --> 24:08.592
That must be Sister Marianna.

24:08.593 --> 24:12.029
She ordered us to stay here
and attack you and the Seeker,

24:12.030 --> 24:15.366
and at least slow you down
if we couldn't kill you.

24:15.367 --> 24:17.034
Please, forgive me, mistress.

24:17.035 --> 24:18.269
Which way did she go?

24:18.270 --> 24:20.804
West.
Let's move.

24:24.142 --> 24:26.744
General.

24:26.745 --> 24:30.247
This woman claims Lord Rahl
ordered her to meet him here.

24:30.248 --> 24:34.285
Sister Marianna, faithful
servant of the Keeper.

24:34.286 --> 24:39.423
The day we have been
waiting for has finally come.

24:39.424 --> 24:40.824
But Lord Rahl is not here.

24:40.825 --> 24:43.227
I have the power to summon him.

24:58.643 --> 25:01.111
Do you still have the scroll?

25:01.112 --> 25:04.415
I wouldn't have dared to appear
before you without it.

25:05.951 --> 25:08.819
My Lord,
I have done asou've commanded

25:08.820 --> 25:11.755
and personally supervised the
incarceration of the prisoner.

25:11.756 --> 25:15.359
I'm so pleased to hear that.

25:15.360 --> 25:19.930
Because now it is time
for our old friend Walter

25:19.931 --> 25:21.298
to die.

25:34.369 --> 25:36.370
It's so cold down here.

25:36.371 --> 25:38.005
Please don't tell anyone,

25:38.006 --> 25:40.173
but I managed to steal
a few tots of rum.

25:40.174 --> 25:43.110
It should
warm you up a bit.

25:58.293 --> 26:01.461
Put these on. Hurry!
What's going on?

26:01.462 --> 26:04.798
I'll explain once
we're outside. Quick.

26:13.107 --> 26:14.975
There's nobody coming.

26:14.976 --> 26:17.778
There will be.

26:17.779 --> 26:19.680
Why are you helping me?

26:19.681 --> 26:21.415
You were kind to me.

26:24.218 --> 26:27.387
Nobody's ever been
kind to me before.

26:28.823 --> 26:30.824
We have to keep going.

26:32.493 --> 26:34.194
He's gone!

26:34.195 --> 26:35.629
My sisters will get him back.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.664
My riders will catch him faster.

26:37.665 --> 26:39.900
Go!

26:49.444 --> 26:51.411
Rahl?

26:53.881 --> 26:56.116
No, no, I'm not him!
I swear I'm not.

26:56.117 --> 26:57.918
I'm just this sod
who looks like him.

26:57.919 --> 26:59.219
It's true.

26:59.220 --> 27:01.288
I saw a Sister of the Dark
summon the spirit

27:01.289 --> 27:02.756
of the real Lord Rahl.

27:02.757 --> 27:05.525
I can't be him. See?
I'm not a spirit.

27:05.526 --> 27:08.428
Go ahead. Touch me.

27:08.429 --> 27:09.963
Uh, but not with that.

27:09.964 --> 27:11.965
Nobody needs to touch you.

27:11.966 --> 27:14.568
It's obvious you're not Rahl.

27:14.569 --> 27:16.036
This Sister of the Dark.

27:16.037 --> 27:17.904
Did she have a scroll with her?

27:17.905 --> 27:19.473
Yes.

27:19.474 --> 27:23.410
Please, help us.

27:23.411 --> 27:25.345
They're planning
to kill Walter.

28:03.851 --> 28:06.286
Thank you for saving us.

28:06.287 --> 28:07.654
We'll just be
on our way now.

28:07.655 --> 28:09.589
We don't want to be
any more trouble. Okay.

28:09.590 --> 28:11.024
You're not going anywhere.

28:11.025 --> 28:12.426
Oh.

28:15.163 --> 28:18.098
The Sister of the Dark is
in that temple with the scroll.

28:18.099 --> 28:19.332
We need to go in and get it.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.935
We don't need extra cargo.

28:21.936 --> 28:23.804
Think about it.

28:23.805 --> 28:26.139
Darken Rahl keeps a look-alike
alive in his castle,

28:26.140 --> 28:27.741
where he has summoned
a Sister of the Dark

28:27.742 --> 28:30.143
to assist the Mord-Sith.

28:30.144 --> 28:32.212
He has all the magical
ingredients he needs

28:32.213 --> 28:35.015
to return to the Land
of the Living

28:35.016 --> 28:37.551
in this man's body.

28:37.552 --> 28:38.718
What?

28:38.719 --> 28:39.853
We can't let him run off

28:39.854 --> 28:41.822
and risk Rahl
recapturing him somehow.

28:41.823 --> 28:45.192
We'll storm the temple,
get the scroll,

28:45.193 --> 28:46.993
and then we'll decide
what to do with them.

28:46.994 --> 28:48.695
You'd better
burn these bodies

28:48.696 --> 28:51.498
before Rahl sends them back
as banelings.

29:08.649 --> 29:11.384
What an unexpected pleasure

29:11.385 --> 29:15.288
to see so many old friends
in one place.

29:15.289 --> 29:18.658
Though I must say, Walter,
I have seen you looking better.

29:18.659 --> 29:21.962
We know what you're planning
to do to him.

29:21.963 --> 29:23.997
And we're not going to let
it happen.

29:23.998 --> 29:28.068
No, something tells me you'll
do more than let it happen.

29:28.069 --> 29:30.604
You are going to kill him
for me too.

29:30.605 --> 29:33.974
And then your new
Sister of the Dark friend here

29:33.975 --> 29:35.876
will summon my soul
into his body,

29:35.877 --> 29:40.080
and Cara's lovely lips
will blow the Breath of Life

29:40.081 --> 29:42.549
into my new lungs.

29:42.550 --> 29:43.884
You're out of your mind.

29:43.885 --> 29:47.721
On the contrary.
I'm thinking quite clearly.

29:47.722 --> 29:49.222
Are you, brother?

29:49.223 --> 29:53.860
Or do I need to remind you that
without the Scroll of Valdaire,

29:53.861 --> 29:56.396
you will never repair the veil?

29:56.397 --> 29:57.998
The Keeper will win,

29:57.999 --> 30:02.369
and every living person
in this world will die.

30:02.370 --> 30:06.339
But if you do as I ask,

30:06.340 --> 30:08.542
I will hand you
the scroll personally.

30:08.543 --> 30:11.611
Suddenly you want
to defeat the Keeper?

30:11.612 --> 30:14.114
I want to live again.

30:14.115 --> 30:18.318
You of all people must
understand that, brother.

30:18.319 --> 30:23.023
I miss the taste
of a crisp apple.

30:23.024 --> 30:26.426
The warm press of a woman's
flesh against my own.

30:27.828 --> 30:30.030
But I must admit,

30:30.031 --> 30:33.466
being a spirit
does have its advantages.

30:33.467 --> 30:37.304
For instance,
I can appear to Sister Marianna

30:37.305 --> 30:40.040
much faster than you
can get to the temple.

30:40.041 --> 30:43.176
I have but to command her
to burn the scroll

30:43.177 --> 30:45.879
and your failure is assured.

30:45.880 --> 30:49.849
So do we have an agreement,

30:49.850 --> 30:51.718
or don't we?

30:57.851 --> 30:59.918
If we turn down Rahl's proposal,

30:59.919 --> 31:02.388
the scroll will be ashes before
we get to the temple.

31:02.389 --> 31:05.024
I never thought I'd say this,
but that devious bastard

31:05.025 --> 31:06.625
has us firmly by our nethers.

31:06.626 --> 31:10.095
We can't just kill Walter.

31:10.096 --> 31:12.131
Maybe we don't have to.

31:12.132 --> 31:15.601
How attached are you to the body
you were born with?

31:15.602 --> 31:18.837
I'd do anything
to have a different face.

31:18.838 --> 31:20.472
I think that can be arranged.

31:20.473 --> 31:22.441
How?

31:22.442 --> 31:24.476
We have the magical means
to put your spirit

31:24.477 --> 31:28.280
into one of these bodies,
and bring you back to life.

31:28.281 --> 31:31.316
And put Rahl's spirit
into Walter's body.

31:31.317 --> 31:33.852
Exactly.

31:33.853 --> 31:36.588
Take your pick,
any one you fancy. But quickly.

31:37.991 --> 31:40.325
Uh...

31:40.326 --> 31:42.027
You choose.

31:42.028 --> 31:43.228
Me?

31:43.229 --> 31:46.632
Yeah. If I'm going to have
a new body,

31:46.633 --> 31:49.668
I want one
that pleases you.

31:49.669 --> 31:51.637
Come.

31:51.638 --> 31:54.506
Zedd, once we give Rahl
his new body,

31:54.507 --> 31:58.043
we can't just trust him
to bring us the scroll back.

31:58.044 --> 32:00.379
You could confess him.

32:00.380 --> 32:03.949
Rahl's soul
is immune to confession.

32:05.819 --> 32:07.986
But there is another way.

32:07.987 --> 32:10.055
You sure this is gonna work?

32:10.056 --> 32:13.325
Don't worry, I went through
it myself, and it worked fine.

32:13.326 --> 32:14.660
Okay.

32:14.661 --> 32:16.795
Oh. Is--?
Is this going to hurt?

32:16.796 --> 32:18.297
I'll try to make it quick.
Okay.

32:21.501 --> 32:24.536
Um! Does it really
have to be a knife?

32:24.537 --> 32:26.672
Just sit back, okay,
and try and relax.

32:26.673 --> 32:28.173
Take a deep breath.

32:33.146 --> 32:34.913
That wasn't so bad,
now, was it?

32:38.218 --> 32:39.918
Don't be afraid, Walter.

32:39.919 --> 32:42.521
I'm right here.

32:59.506 --> 33:01.073
Now.

33:14.521 --> 33:17.689
Mika, it's me.

33:17.690 --> 33:18.924
I'm back!

33:57.697 --> 34:01.166
Ah, it's good to be back.

34:09.074 --> 34:11.844
I knew you'd do
the right thing, brother.

34:19.719 --> 34:22.487
Sister Tyra is going with you
to the temple.

34:22.487 --> 34:25.924
You're going to get the scroll
and bring it straight back.

34:25.925 --> 34:29.594
Otherwise, she'll release
the magic of the dacra,

34:29.596 --> 34:32.063
and you'll be dead again
in a heartbeat.

34:32.065 --> 34:33.831
This really wasn't necessary.

34:33.833 --> 34:37.936
I would have done
exactly as I promised.

34:37.937 --> 34:40.873
Well, I won't have to take
that on good faith now, will I?

34:45.578 --> 34:46.678
My Lord.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.280
How is it possible
you've returned

34:48.281 --> 34:50.047
without the help
of Sister Marianna?

34:50.049 --> 34:52.184
And how did you get
the prisoner's body

34:52.185 --> 34:54.186
when my men have
yet to return with him?

34:54.187 --> 34:55.554
I don't know
what rabbit trail

34:55.554 --> 34:57.556
your men are following,
Egremont.

34:57.557 --> 34:59.791
Fortunately,
their ineptitude was redeemed

34:59.792 --> 35:02.060
by Sister Tyra here.

35:02.061 --> 35:03.662
You flatter me, My Lord.

35:03.663 --> 35:05.530
Not only did she recapture
and kill Walter,

35:05.531 --> 35:08.500
she performed the ritual
of resurrection.

35:08.501 --> 35:12.371
What Mord-Sith did you find to
administer the Breath of Life?

35:12.372 --> 35:14.973
I was revived by Tyra,

35:14.974 --> 35:17.142
who had the foresight

35:17.143 --> 35:19.344
to kill a Mord-Sith
and take her han.

35:19.345 --> 35:21.313
It appears you
and your sisters

35:21.314 --> 35:23.815
are not as indispensable
as you think.

35:23.816 --> 35:26.752
Now give me the scroll.

35:26.753 --> 35:30.722
My Lord, you do seem
very much yourself,

35:30.723 --> 35:33.091
but in light of recent
misunderstandings,

35:33.092 --> 35:35.227
I believe you would want me
to verify the identity

35:35.228 --> 35:37.029
of anyone who claimed to be you.

35:37.030 --> 35:38.363
Of course.

35:38.364 --> 35:40.532
I'm sure you could tell me,
for example,

35:40.533 --> 35:43.869
what was the gift you gave
your sister Jennsen last year

35:43.870 --> 35:45.370
when you were trying
to earn her trust?

35:45.371 --> 35:47.272
A kitten.
And unless you want to share

35:47.273 --> 35:48.941
that poor creature's
unfortunate fate,

35:48.942 --> 35:51.310
you will hand me
the scroll right now.

36:07.126 --> 36:10.228
Hm.

36:10.229 --> 36:12.197
How very interesting.

36:12.198 --> 36:14.800
You may be on your way now,
Sister.

36:16.769 --> 36:18.704
Sisters!

36:22.275 --> 36:25.577
You will of course want
refreshment, My Lord.

36:25.578 --> 36:27.579
And company.

36:27.580 --> 36:30.248
Yes, I would.

36:35.688 --> 36:38.724
But unfortunately,
I have time for neither.

36:38.725 --> 36:40.559
I must be on my way.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.828
Prepare a wagon
for my treasure.

36:42.829 --> 36:44.963
At once, My Lord.

36:48.735 --> 36:50.902
The Mother Confessor said
nothing about treasure.

36:50.903 --> 36:54.072
Now that I'm alive again, I have
no intention of being penniless.

36:54.073 --> 36:56.274
I won't allow you
to displease my mistress.

36:56.275 --> 36:59.077
Well, imagine her displeasure if
the Seeker never has a chance

36:59.078 --> 37:00.545
to read this scroll.

37:00.546 --> 37:03.782
Oh, you may command the magic
of the dacra to kill me,

37:03.783 --> 37:07.886
but by then this parchment
will be nothing but cinders.

37:07.887 --> 37:10.288
My Lord.
Your wagon is being prepared.

37:10.289 --> 37:12.891
Shall I assume we're returning
to the People's Palace

37:12.892 --> 37:14.226
to reclaim your throne?

37:14.227 --> 37:15.894
You are to remain here,
Egremont.

37:15.895 --> 37:18.830
My Lord, I am most eager to
help you resecure your domain.

37:18.831 --> 37:21.700
The time
is not yet right.

37:21.701 --> 37:23.068
Before I return
to the palace,

37:23.069 --> 37:25.771
I must pay a visit
to Ravensberg.

37:25.772 --> 37:28.106
When I'm ready, I will send
for you. Is that clear?

37:28.107 --> 37:29.775
Yes, My Lord.

37:38.551 --> 37:40.986
I need your best archers,
at once.

37:40.987 --> 37:42.254
Why?

37:42.255 --> 37:44.189
Lord Rahl was sending me
a message.

37:44.190 --> 37:47.893
He was once ambushed at
Ravensberg and almost killed.

37:47.894 --> 37:51.630
He's telling me
he's in danger again now.

37:51.631 --> 37:54.633
And we're going
to get him out of it.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.669
<i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

38:05.001 --> 38:06.568
Do you have the scroll?

38:09.872 --> 38:13.709
I think you'll find it
interesting reading.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.143
I know I did.

38:16.546 --> 38:17.879
Hand it over.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.215
Of course, brother.

38:20.216 --> 38:22.684
But in case your plan

38:22.685 --> 38:24.486
is to have your pet
Sister of the Dark here

38:24.487 --> 38:25.787
kill me once I relinquish it,

38:25.788 --> 38:28.490
you should know that I would
then be forced

38:28.491 --> 38:31.360
to tell the Keeper
what is written on the scroll.

38:31.361 --> 38:34.763
And then he will know exactly
where you'll be going next.

38:34.764 --> 38:39.067
I imagine he would send an army
of banelings to greet you.

38:39.068 --> 38:41.903
You win.

38:41.904 --> 38:43.472
She won't release the magic.

38:43.473 --> 38:45.307
Now give me the scroll.

38:50.146 --> 38:53.982
Now get this thing
out of me.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.751
I'm thinking maybe we should
leave it in.

38:55.752 --> 38:57.819
You're much more
cooperative this way.

38:59.022 --> 39:01.690
Lord Rahl is under
the Seeker's control.

39:01.691 --> 39:04.893
And will be as long as
the Sister of the Dark lives.

39:04.894 --> 39:06.628
Kill her.

39:51.140 --> 39:54.176
Let's go. I know
a place we can be safe.

39:54.177 --> 39:56.645
And happy.

39:59.148 --> 40:01.183
Hyah!

40:01.184 --> 40:04.086
For D'Hara and Lord Rahl!

40:25.341 --> 40:27.075
Hyah!

40:27.076 --> 40:28.810
Walter's getting away
with the treasure.

40:28.811 --> 40:30.812
We have no use for it.
Let them go.

40:30.813 --> 40:32.280
They're not the only ones
that got away.

40:33.850 --> 40:35.617
Rahl's gone too.

40:35.618 --> 40:37.185
We can track him.

40:37.186 --> 40:39.121
Maybe.
We didn't come for Rahl.

40:39.122 --> 40:41.356
We came to find out
what we're supposed to do

40:41.357 --> 40:42.924
with the Stone of Tears.

40:42.925 --> 40:44.459
What does it say?

40:44.460 --> 40:48.396
"The instructions
inscribed upon this scroll

40:48.397 --> 40:50.565
"will only appear in the glow

40:50.566 --> 40:52.100
cast by a Night Wisp."

40:53.636 --> 40:56.638
All this trouble and the
instructions are invisible?

40:56.639 --> 41:01.243
Only until we find
one of Kahlan's tiny friends.

41:01.244 --> 41:03.311
Well, I guess we know
which where we're headed.

41:03.312 --> 41:05.647
So does Rahl.

41:09.285 --> 41:11.753
A tankard of stout ale, barkeep.

41:11.754 --> 41:15.857
Aha, a brother in arms!

41:15.858 --> 41:18.426
Brings to mind
the good old days.

41:18.427 --> 41:21.930
You know, I once came damnably
close to bringing back

41:21.931 --> 41:23.398
those good old days.

41:23.399 --> 41:27.135
It's quite a story,
and I'd be happy to tell it

41:27.136 --> 41:31.339
if my, um, ahem--
If throat weren't so damn dry.

41:31.340 --> 41:32.807
I already know that story.

41:32.808 --> 41:36.678
In fact,
I know a part of it you don't.

41:36.679 --> 41:39.414
The happy ending.

41:39.415 --> 41:40.782
Oh, what's the matter, Malray?

41:40.783 --> 41:42.851
Don't you recognize
your old friend?

41:45.121 --> 41:47.923
Walter? How?

41:47.924 --> 41:49.124
That's quite a story too.

41:49.125 --> 41:50.525
Which I'll tell you
on the road.

41:50.526 --> 41:52.327
That is of course
if you're still interested

41:52.328 --> 41:53.795
in going to Merilandria.

41:53.796 --> 41:55.931
Oh, I-I'm a little short
of funds, I'm afraid.

41:55.932 --> 41:57.999
I've recently come into
a small fortune myself.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.467
Found a girl too.

41:59.468 --> 42:00.602
The right one.

42:00.603 --> 42:02.637
She's outside
in a coach right now.

42:02.638 --> 42:04.172
And I've bought passage
for three

42:04.173 --> 42:06.174
on the next ship
out of Wynnmore.

42:06.175 --> 42:07.976
Is-- Is this really possible?

42:07.977 --> 42:10.412
Walter!

42:12.582 --> 42:14.349
Just close your eyes, Malray...

42:14.350 --> 42:16.551
And imagine yourself
by the sea.

42:19.989 --> 42:22.457
Cheers.
