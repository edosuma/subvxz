WEBVTT

03:34.320 --> 03:36.197
- Yeah, another half inch
and it's out there for good.

03:36.698 --> 03:38.366
Hey, hurry up
with them bean-

03:49.502 --> 03:51.963
- If you got the money to pay,
I give you a plate of beans.

03:58.720 --> 03:59.554
- Mm-hmm.

04:25.037 --> 04:27.415
- That's enough for me.

04:31.377 --> 04:33.087
- He ain't hungry.

04:39.802 --> 04:41.721
- There.

04:47.477 --> 04:48.728
- Leave it here.

05:44.534 --> 05:46.786
- Relax, Chico,
you'll live longer.

05:46.869 --> 05:50.706
- Yeah, 'til tomorrow, anyway.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.959
- Listen to him, will ya?

06:30.288 --> 06:31.873
There's only one way
to find out.

06:47.054 --> 06:50.558
That ain't hungry.
That's famine.

06:50.641 --> 06:53.060
Usually happens when
you cross a desert on the run.

06:53.144 --> 06:55.146
- Yeah, and whoever
crosses a desert fast

06:55.229 --> 06:57.565
got somethin' gnawin' on
his conscience, huh?

06:57.648 --> 07:01.569
- Right.

07:01.652 --> 07:04.196
So, what's on
your conscience, huh?

07:07.533 --> 07:09.869
You better check twice.
He's pretty dirty.

07:23.215 --> 07:25.635
Hmm.

07:25.718 --> 07:28.846
Lucky for you, mister,
you're just a starvin' animal.

07:37.396 --> 07:39.023
Yeah.

07:45.071 --> 07:48.199
- Ah, Señor...
- Take it easy, Max.

07:48.282 --> 07:50.076
You gotta last
another 12 hours.

07:50.159 --> 07:51.452
You ain't worth
a cent dead.

07:55.206 --> 07:57.500
- He'll make it
'til tomorrow.

07:59.335 --> 08:00.962
- Hey, can you imagine
what he's gonna look like

08:01.045 --> 08:02.004
when they
hang him tomorrow?

08:02.088 --> 08:03.798
- He'll be dangling
like puppet.

08:03.881 --> 08:04.924
- Yeah.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.885
- Hey, you take it easy
there, Chico.

08:07.969 --> 08:10.429
You get all excited,
you're gonna bust a gut.

08:20.147 --> 08:23.442
- Feel almost human
now, don't ya?

08:23.526 --> 08:25.653
- Yeah.

08:25.736 --> 08:27.780
You just take it easy
there now, max.

08:27.863 --> 08:29.949
- Si, señor.

08:38.707 --> 08:42.628
- Vamos, hombre, let's go.
- What'd you say?

08:42.712 --> 08:43.629
- Come on, get up.

08:47.383 --> 08:49.593
- You know, Sage,
least you could do

08:49.677 --> 08:52.013
for a man who wants to die
is to wish him

08:52.096 --> 08:53.806
a cross with
his name on it.

08:53.889 --> 08:56.183
You just give him your name,
you'll get one.

08:56.267 --> 08:59.770
- They call me Trinity.

08:59.854 --> 09:02.481
- Trinity?
- Mm-hmm.

09:02.565 --> 09:05.067
- Well, that's...
- Right-hand of the devil.

09:09.155 --> 09:11.824
- Come on, move.

09:14.201 --> 09:15.786
How much do I owe ya?

09:15.870 --> 09:19.540
- Uh, nada- nothing,
on the house.

09:19.623 --> 09:21.292
- Thanks.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.377
The beans weren't
much good, anyway.

09:26.422 --> 09:27.465
- Señor, they're going
to shoot you.

09:27.548 --> 09:30.176
- Shh.
- Hey, Trinity.

09:30.259 --> 09:32.261
They say you got
the fastest gun around.

09:34.889 --> 09:38.726
- Is that what they say?
- Yeah.

09:38.809 --> 09:41.103
- Geez.

09:53.449 --> 09:56.452
Okay, Chico, suppose
you tell us what happened, huh?

09:57.787 --> 09:59.872
- There was a gringo,
Señor.

09:59.955 --> 10:02.166
He want to make love
to my mujer,

10:02.249 --> 10:04.376
so I push him away
with a little knife.

10:04.460 --> 10:06.712
A very little
knife, señor.

10:06.796 --> 10:08.964
Oh, but when I look into
his black eyes,

10:09.048 --> 10:12.510
they turn white, and
he falls down to the ground.

10:12.593 --> 10:13.969
Bada-boom.

10:14.053 --> 10:15.638
He must have
hit his head.

10:15.721 --> 10:16.639
- Must've at that.

10:16.722 --> 10:19.100
- Yeah, I think so,
too, señor.

10:19.183 --> 10:19.975
- Any witnesses?

10:20.059 --> 10:22.978
- No, only me.
- Think hard now, Chico.

10:23.062 --> 10:24.688
- You mean my wife
and the knife, señor?

10:24.772 --> 10:26.607
- And me.
Hah!

10:27.024 --> 10:28.776
- Oh, no, there was
only this gringo,

10:28.859 --> 10:30.444
and he want to make love
to my wife.

10:31.112 --> 10:33.239
- Yeah, I know,
and you pushed him away

10:33.322 --> 10:35.199
with a very
little knife.

10:35.282 --> 10:36.617
- Si, Señor.

10:36.784 --> 10:38.119
- Hah!

11:32.506 --> 11:35.092
- Clear out and leave me
in peace!

11:36.510 --> 11:38.179
- We'll go when we're ready.

11:38.888 --> 11:40.931
- You're the one that's
lookin' for trouble now!

11:41.265 --> 11:43.225
- Look, can't you see
I'm busy?

11:43.309 --> 11:45.186
- So are we!

11:47.396 --> 11:49.648
- Only one way
to let him know now.

11:49.732 --> 11:51.609
- Yeah, the hard way.

11:55.905 --> 11:58.949
- Go on, 90.
Be good boys.

12:00.743 --> 12:02.953
- Sheriff!
- Go away.

12:03.412 --> 12:04.914
Scat!

12:05.372 --> 12:08.125
- If you want that tin star
to see the sun again,

12:08.209 --> 12:10.669
you better
set our friend free.

12:10.753 --> 12:13.172
- He crawled into
a woman's bed.

12:13.255 --> 12:15.758
She wanted him out,
he didn't get out.

12:15.841 --> 12:17.927
They call that
carnal violence.

12:18.010 --> 12:20.596
He's gonna have to go
before the judge.

12:20.679 --> 12:22.640
- How do you expect the judge
to see it straight?

12:22.723 --> 12:25.517
That old bag was his wife,
and she woulda stayed there,

12:25.601 --> 12:27.811
too, if the old man
hadn't a come in.

12:28.312 --> 12:29.897
She was purrin' sweet
up until then.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.732
- Your friend chose
the wrong bed.

12:31.815 --> 12:34.151
The law is the law,
and strange as it may seem

12:34.235 --> 12:37.655
to the likes of you, the law
is gonna be respected.

12:38.405 --> 12:41.825
Now, you got exactly
one minute to split town.

12:41.909 --> 12:44.245
- This is the last
warning, sheriff.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.664
Let our friend out!

13:16.860 --> 13:18.862
- Boys, I have the impression

13:18.946 --> 13:21.407
we're going to have to elect
a new sheriff.

13:21.991 --> 13:24.076
- You wanna run, Jeff?
- Not a chance.

13:56.567 --> 13:59.778
- Hey, you!
Stinkweed!

14:01.822 --> 14:02.823
- You mean me?

14:03.365 --> 14:05.200
- Yeah, I mean you,
rag picker!

14:05.617 --> 14:07.328
- I think he means you.

14:07.745 --> 14:09.496
- Drop that holster!

14:22.593 --> 14:23.719
- Huh.

14:27.056 --> 14:30.184
- Now it's your turn,
Sheriff- drop it!

14:40.235 --> 14:43.030
- They'll be stiff
before they can draw.

14:50.621 --> 14:52.915
What did I tell you?
- Madre Mia.

14:52.998 --> 14:54.625
Who is he, Señor?

14:57.002 --> 14:58.504
- The left hand
of the devil.

15:08.514 --> 15:10.641
- Never woulda
believed it.

15:16.438 --> 15:19.066
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's a long story.

15:19.149 --> 15:20.859
He's up for ransom.
You know how it is.

15:20.943 --> 15:22.486
The Mexicans are
always wrong.

15:22.569 --> 15:24.279
- What's he have to say?
- Nothin'--

15:24.363 --> 15:25.948
Self defense with witnesses
to the fact.

15:26.031 --> 15:27.866
Write him a pardon
and send him home.

15:27.950 --> 15:29.243
- No, Señor Sheriff,
it's not true.

15:29.326 --> 15:32.663
There were no peoples.
It was only this gringo.

15:33.914 --> 15:36.125
He want to--
he want to make love-—

15:36.208 --> 15:37.584
- Oh, stop it.

15:37.668 --> 15:40.504
- He want to make love
to my mujer, señor.

15:45.926 --> 15:47.511
- Here.

15:50.389 --> 15:51.849
It's a bad wound.

15:52.099 --> 15:54.726
Lucky for him, the bullet
plugged up the vein.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.566
Give me a hand.

16:11.452 --> 16:13.328
- Anesthesia?
- Si, Señor.

16:20.377 --> 16:21.920
Yeah.

16:22.963 --> 16:24.756
Oh, that's a very
big knife.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.676
- No, very little.
Here, have some more.

16:34.683 --> 16:35.976
- Here.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.990
- Another swig, hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

16:54.661 --> 16:56.997
- How's the old lady?
- The same.

16:57.080 --> 17:00.042
She's always got
something wrong with her.

17:00.542 --> 17:01.877
- Now, where the devil
is it?

17:01.960 --> 17:04.253
- In New Orleans,
runnin' a whore house.

17:04.338 --> 17:05.797
- I was talkin' about
the bullet.

17:09.175 --> 17:10.093
There it is.

17:14.848 --> 17:16.098
- Hmm.

17:20.854 --> 17:22.731
- Put your finger in it.

17:46.505 --> 17:49.091
- You gringos are over here
with your burros.

17:49.174 --> 17:50.717
- That's right.
- You make love to our señoras

17:50.801 --> 17:52.177
and want to sleep.

17:52.261 --> 17:54.888
- Good idea-
go on to sleep.

18:00.519 --> 18:02.271
- Sweet dreams.

18:06.191 --> 18:09.152
Tomorrow, you can take him
back to his beloved mujer.

18:14.324 --> 18:16.952
- You're still quick
on the draw, I see.

18:17.035 --> 18:20.122
- That reminds me.
Thanks for your help.

18:21.873 --> 18:23.125
- There were only three.

18:23.208 --> 18:26.044
- Yeah, for now,
but let me tell ya.

18:26.295 --> 18:29.089
They'll be swarmin' into
this damn town.

18:30.007 --> 18:31.883
You'd do better to get
outta here before

18:31.967 --> 18:35.345
all the dudes in the west
fall in to match guns.

18:35.846 --> 18:38.348
- Well, I'm not
lookin' for trouble.

18:38.432 --> 18:41.602
- Yeah, you never knew
how to do anything else.

18:52.029 --> 18:54.698
- Smells like a distillery
in here.

18:59.077 --> 19:01.830
Who is he?
- My brother.

19:02.873 --> 19:04.958
He's just passin' through.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.252
He's leavin' tomorrow.

19:08.503 --> 19:11.506
- He looked and smelled like that,
too, when he came here.

19:11.590 --> 19:15.218
Had to use three pieces of soap
to see the color of his skin.

19:15.302 --> 19:18.347
So, young man, if you wanna shake
my hand, take a bath first.

19:18.430 --> 19:20.474
Don't wanna catch
no tetanus.

19:23.644 --> 19:25.437
- Ah, now what's that?

19:27.022 --> 19:28.482
- How'd you end up
like this?

19:28.565 --> 19:31.109
- Ah, there was
somebody following me.

19:31.693 --> 19:33.445
- The owner of
the star.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.448
- Mm-hmm.

19:36.573 --> 19:38.784
- Downright disgusting.
- Hey,gringo...

19:38.867 --> 19:41.828
- Two days after-
two days after my escape

19:41.912 --> 19:44.790
from the penitentiary
in Yuma,

19:44.873 --> 19:48.001
I saw somebody
following me.

19:48.085 --> 19:49.670
He wasn't after me.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.463
We were just going
the same way,

19:51.546 --> 19:54.257
but I didn't know that,
and I shot him.

19:54.341 --> 19:57.052
Found out later he was
the new sheriff of this town,

19:57.552 --> 19:59.596
come to replace
the one that was killed.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.933
There was this here star
in one of his pockets,

20:03.100 --> 20:05.727
so I took his place
to wait for my men

20:05.811 --> 20:08.021
and head for
California together.

20:08.105 --> 20:09.898
I planned a couple
of good hold-ups,

20:10.065 --> 20:12.401
but I bet you'll manage
to mess things up on me.

20:12.567 --> 20:14.986
I don't know how, but
I'm sure you'll do it.

20:15.153 --> 20:16.571
- Hmm.

20:16.655 --> 20:18.490
- This isn't a jail,
it's a cesspool!

20:18.865 --> 20:21.493
Which reminds me-
while you were out of town,

20:21.576 --> 20:23.328
there was a real slaughter
at the saloon.

20:23.412 --> 20:26.415
The Major's men just pounded
two of those farmers.

20:26.498 --> 20:29.501
And from now on, they'll eat
nothin' but puddin'

20:29.584 --> 20:33.171
'cause they left their teeth
on the bar room floor.

20:33.797 --> 20:36.007
- Hmm.
Were they armed?

20:36.883 --> 20:38.343
- Those farmers don't
go around armed.

20:38.427 --> 20:41.221
You know that, Sheriff.
Come on, young fella.

20:41.304 --> 20:43.682
Let's get home
and give yourself a bath

20:43.765 --> 20:45.559
and see what
you look like.

20:45.642 --> 20:48.520
- Well--
- You get washed up,

20:48.603 --> 20:51.148
and tomorrow you leave.
- See ya later.

20:51.273 --> 20:53.817
- No, you're not gonna
see me later!

20:54.401 --> 20:56.820
- You sure you two fellas
are brothers?

20:56.903 --> 20:58.363
- Yep.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.242
Same mother.
- Oh.

21:25.223 --> 21:28.643
I ain't seen so much dirt
since the overflow of the Pecos.

21:33.106 --> 21:34.941
It's the last piece!

21:35.025 --> 21:37.569
- From what I understand, there's
a lotta dirt in this town, too.

21:37.652 --> 21:39.738
- Well, if you're referring
to the Major's men,

21:39.821 --> 21:41.782
he just won't let up
on those farmers.

21:41.865 --> 21:45.702
He keeps breakin' their bones,
and they come back for more.

21:45.786 --> 21:47.954
Hard as nails, them farmers.

21:48.371 --> 21:52.250
- Well, why don't they fight back?
- Against their principles.

21:53.376 --> 21:56.296
Strange folks
from back East.

21:56.379 --> 22:00.258
All they do, is, uh,
work and pray, pray and work.

22:00.342 --> 22:02.427
Pray and work
is all they do.

22:06.014 --> 22:07.933
- What's my brother
doin' about it?

22:08.016 --> 22:10.393
- Beans- that's what
he's doin' about it.

22:10.477 --> 22:11.436
You know somethin'?

22:11.520 --> 22:14.648
I've never seen such an unlucky
sheriff in all my life.

22:14.731 --> 22:17.400
When somethin' happens,
he's someplace else,

22:17.484 --> 22:18.777
and vice versa.

22:18.860 --> 22:22.030
- He's always been very unlucky.
- Yeah.

22:25.033 --> 22:26.701
If I'd known you were gonna
put on them rags,

22:26.785 --> 22:30.330
I wouldn't have given you
that last piece of soap.

22:32.290 --> 22:34.543
- Evening, Sheriff.
- Shut up.

22:34.626 --> 22:38.547
- What's got into him?
- The usual nightly scolding.

22:38.630 --> 22:42.092
- The Major's men?
- Yep.

22:42.175 --> 22:43.635
Well, g'bye, young fella.

22:43.718 --> 22:46.179
I'm gonna take my bones
to bed.

22:46.263 --> 22:49.599
In case I don't see you again,
uh, which is likely,

22:49.683 --> 22:51.476
good luck to ya, huh?

22:55.397 --> 22:58.567
- Listen, Major, I'm gettin'
a little weary

22:58.650 --> 23:00.569
of these punks of yours.

23:00.652 --> 23:02.612
Either they let
the farmers be,

23:02.696 --> 23:06.074
or I'll have to
take away their guns.

23:06.157 --> 23:08.451
- Why don't you do it?

23:08.535 --> 23:11.288
- Yeah, how about that,
Sheriff?

23:11.371 --> 23:13.206
- Hmm.

23:25.385 --> 23:27.721
- They're good boys,
Sheriff.

23:27.804 --> 23:30.223
Hard workin' cowhands
need a little diversion

23:30.307 --> 23:32.350
when Saturday night
rolls around.

23:32.434 --> 23:34.769
- Like squattin'
helpless farmers, huh?

23:34.853 --> 23:36.897
- Well, what
do you expect?

23:36.980 --> 23:39.566
If the farmers insist
on provoking trouble,

23:39.649 --> 23:41.693
a few fists are gonna start flyin'.

23:41.776 --> 23:45.697
It's only human nature.
Or, would you know about that?

23:45.780 --> 23:48.867
Now, I heartily suggest that
you go about your business

23:48.950 --> 23:51.202
and leave me and my men
in peace.

23:53.455 --> 23:56.458
- Put it any way you want,
Major-— this is the last warning

23:56.541 --> 23:59.294
for you and for
your chicken rustlers.

24:00.170 --> 24:02.422
- What did you say?

24:03.590 --> 24:05.550
- Chicken rustlers.

24:05.926 --> 24:07.844
- Oh.

24:09.387 --> 24:13.308
- You have the strangest way
of doin' your job, Sheriff.

24:14.768 --> 24:16.603
And let me tell you--

24:16.770 --> 24:18.772
I don't like it.

24:27.322 --> 24:29.616
Listen, boys.

24:30.867 --> 24:33.078
- Come on, slug, pull out.

24:33.578 --> 24:36.206
- What the devil is the matter
with you, Jeff?

24:45.298 --> 24:48.510
This sheriff's beginning
to bother me.

24:48.927 --> 24:53.431
He's a bit too dull to appreciate
my position in this town.

24:53.807 --> 24:56.101
Well, he'll learn
the hard way.

24:56.267 --> 25:00.063
- They work like ants, but that
don't soften the Major none-

25:00.397 --> 25:03.817
he wants to hog up their
whole valley for his horses.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.152
- What do you care?
You're not the sheriff.

25:06.236 --> 25:08.613
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

25:08.697 --> 25:12.283
But if he stirs up enough fuss,
the rangers will get here

25:12.409 --> 25:15.912
before my boys, Weasel and
Timmy, can catch up with me.

25:15.996 --> 25:19.833
Besides, on principle,
I hate to see him win out.

25:19.916 --> 25:21.292
- Why?

25:22.043 --> 25:24.254
- Because two feet
this side of the valley,

25:24.337 --> 25:26.172
he's got the most beautiful
pack of horses

25:26.256 --> 25:29.509
I ever seen.
Unbranded.

25:29.592 --> 25:33.013
Once he drives the farmers out
and brings his herd in,

25:33.096 --> 25:36.266
what chance have I got
to rustle 'em back out again?

25:36.349 --> 25:39.019
- So, give 'em a hand.
- Who, the Major?

25:39.102 --> 25:41.521
- The farmers.

25:41.604 --> 25:44.482
- Ah, it's easier
said than done.

25:44.566 --> 25:48.153
Can't even root up
a-a hoot owl in this here town

25:48.236 --> 25:51.114
that's willing to face
the Major's men.

25:51.197 --> 25:53.324
And I can't do it all alone.

26:00.290 --> 26:02.042
- Oh,no.

26:02.709 --> 26:04.377
- Oh, yes.

26:05.086 --> 26:06.755
- No.

26:07.213 --> 26:09.924
- A dollar a day.
- No.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.677
- And ammunition.

26:14.012 --> 26:16.181
With room and board.

26:17.307 --> 26:20.727
And you get ol' Jonathan
to cook and wait on ya.

26:25.106 --> 26:26.524
Okay?

26:28.526 --> 26:29.652
- No.

26:31.154 --> 26:34.574
- Then get your carcass
outta here and leave me be!

26:49.672 --> 26:51.966
- Hah,hah,hah!

27:01.309 --> 27:03.728
- Looks like they're plannin'
to settle down.

27:03.812 --> 27:06.815
That ain't no moonlight camp
they're buildin', Major.

27:06.898 --> 27:09.692
- Not if we
persuade them differently.

27:09.776 --> 27:13.363
Boys, show the brethren
how to build a decent house.

27:13.446 --> 27:17.367
That structure doesn't
strike me as being very sturdy.

27:17.450 --> 27:19.494
- This is time for work.
We can play later.

27:19.577 --> 27:21.204
Go on.

27:51.025 --> 27:53.528
- Welcome, Major.
- Are you sure?

27:53.611 --> 27:55.363
- We're not given
to lying, Major.

27:55.446 --> 27:58.032
- Only to shadin'
the truth.

27:58.116 --> 28:00.034
If, by some
dark miracle,

28:00.118 --> 28:02.704
I should vanish
before your eyes,

28:02.787 --> 28:05.874
I sincerely doubt
you'd feel any remorse.

28:05.957 --> 28:08.668
- We crave no such miracle,
but only for

28:08.751 --> 28:11.504
a sense of dignity
in our poverty.

28:11.588 --> 28:14.841
- Oh, there is nothin' more
aggravatin' than a hypocrite.

28:15.967 --> 28:17.886
Now, you came here
in a wagon

28:17.969 --> 28:19.721
with a few rags
and a lotta hope.

28:19.804 --> 28:21.472
- A lot of faith, Major.

28:21.556 --> 28:23.558
- Yes, and,
by sheer coincidence,

28:23.641 --> 28:24.726
after a few months,

28:24.809 --> 28:28.730
more of your so-called
brothers arrived.

28:28.813 --> 28:32.025
And good ol' faith
forms a community,

28:32.108 --> 28:33.985
builds a house that
could shelter an army,

28:34.068 --> 28:37.739
and, uh, fills the corrals
with livestock.

28:37.822 --> 28:40.825
Now, yours is certainly
a very dignified

28:40.909 --> 28:43.870
and, uh, lucrative poverty.

28:44.078 --> 28:46.247
- It was wild cattle
by God sent.

28:46.623 --> 28:50.543
- Which, however,
you branded quickly enough.

28:50.627 --> 28:52.712
And while my horses
split their hooves

28:52.795 --> 28:56.382
grazing on rocks,
your cows grow fat

28:56.466 --> 28:59.385
and shamelessly prolific
like you.

28:59.552 --> 29:02.722
- We sought but a small square
of land on which to live.

29:02.931 --> 29:04.390
- But this small square

29:04.474 --> 29:07.352
covers over 200,000 acres,
my friend.

29:07.477 --> 29:10.688
- We ask only a small part of it.
There's land for all.

29:11.147 --> 29:13.024
Bring your horses
to graze here.

29:13.107 --> 29:15.485
We will not resent
their presence.

29:15.568 --> 29:18.196
- No, but they'd
resent yours.

29:18.529 --> 29:21.366
Now, I advise you
to pack up your goods,

29:21.449 --> 29:24.202
your people, your faith,
and your cows,

29:24.285 --> 29:26.120
and clear out of
my valley.

29:26.371 --> 29:29.540
- We've come 2,000 miles.
- You can go another 2,000.

29:29.666 --> 29:32.961
- We have children, Major.
- Oh, I hate children.

29:33.127 --> 29:36.506
- Major, I've tried to appeal
to your sentiments,

29:36.589 --> 29:38.883
but you force me now
to remind you

29:38.967 --> 29:42.345
that we came to this valley
before you.

29:44.931 --> 29:47.934
- I believe it was the Lord
in one of his parables

29:48.017 --> 29:50.895
who said,
"blessed are the last,

29:50.979 --> 29:53.856
"for they shall be the first."

29:54.941 --> 29:56.776
So, why should I hurry?

29:56.859 --> 30:00.738
- It is evil to be cynical.
- It's practical.

30:00.822 --> 30:02.824
- May the lord forgive you.
- Well, I hope so,

30:02.907 --> 30:04.742
but I wouldn't count on it
very much.

30:04.826 --> 30:05.785
- Hah!
- Hey!

30:05.868 --> 30:06.786
- Yam, yam
- Rah, ha'“, hah'.!

30:06.869 --> 30:08.538
- Hah, hah!

30:12.583 --> 30:15.378
- Let this be a reminder,
old man.

30:15.461 --> 30:19.340
Either you leave this valley,
or I'll bury you in it.

30:20.341 --> 30:22.802
The choice is yours.

30:23.970 --> 30:25.847
Let's go, boys!

30:31.728 --> 30:34.022
- Hah!
- Hah,hah,hah!

30:37.108 --> 30:40.278
- Yah,yah,yah!
- Hah,yah!

30:42.238 --> 30:44.490
- To work, brothers, to work!

30:47.327 --> 30:48.661
- Hold it!

30:55.251 --> 30:58.129
- Who are they?
- It's Mezcal and his raiders, Major.

30:58.212 --> 31:00.340
Once in a while, they rustle
a few horses from us.

31:00.423 --> 31:03.176
- Well, that's
very interesting.

31:20.943 --> 31:23.613
- Welcome, brothers.
- Thank you, brother.

31:30.536 --> 31:33.039
You forget that
you are guests.

31:33.122 --> 31:35.875
Why don't you answer
brother Tobias' greeting?

31:39.128 --> 31:40.505
- He's my brother.

31:40.588 --> 31:43.383
- Now, you give this poor
brother something to eat, eh?

32:04.028 --> 32:07.365
- It doesn't taste like anything.
- We have no other food to offer.

32:07.448 --> 32:09.409
- You did it on purpose. Yes?
- No, it's not true, brother.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.327
- You make this mess
so you don't have to share it.

32:11.411 --> 32:13.996
- No, we'd share anything we can.
- Lies, liar! Quiet!

32:16.457 --> 32:17.917
Shut up!

32:20.086 --> 32:22.130
Next time,
no fooling around.

32:22.213 --> 32:24.841
I want good soup
with garlic and mucho vino!

32:26.092 --> 32:27.468
Vamonos.

32:38.020 --> 32:41.941
- You know what that old fool
would say if he was in my place?

32:43.860 --> 32:46.904
The ways of the Lord
are many.

33:29.906 --> 33:32.200
- This is for the sheriff.

33:33.743 --> 33:37.121
By the way, where is he?
- He went outta town.

33:54.472 --> 33:57.391
- I thought your brother said
you were leavin' town today!

33:57.475 --> 33:59.894
- The day ain't over yet!

34:04.774 --> 34:06.067
- Hey, you wanna bet
somethin' is gonna happen

34:06.150 --> 34:07.902
now that he's
out of town?

34:11.906 --> 34:15.326
Hey, I'm talkin' to ya!
You wanna bet?

34:25.085 --> 34:26.879
- Brother Tobias said,
if there's anything left over,

34:26.963 --> 34:29.966
we can get that nice bread.
Oh, I wonder if they still

34:30.049 --> 34:31.425
have any of that bread.

34:31.967 --> 34:34.512
- I thought I told you to get out.
- Joe!

34:34.594 --> 34:37.598
- But we need these goods, sir.
- What you need is a lesson.

34:37.681 --> 34:40.601
- When I say, "out," I mean out.
- No, wait, brother!

34:40.685 --> 34:42.395
- Joe!
O-h, Joe!

34:43.396 --> 34:45.773
- You'll pay for this
on Judgment Day!

34:45.856 --> 34:47.108
- All right, but 'til that day,

34:47.190 --> 34:49.652
don't show your faces
around here. Is that clear?

34:50.277 --> 34:53.822
Go on. Get back to your
cow flops. Go on, scat!

34:55.658 --> 34:57.952
- Come on, Joe.
Wake up.

35:01.497 --> 35:04.292
- Put him in a trough.
That'll wake him up.

35:11.674 --> 35:15.177
- Easy does it.
- Got a new sheriff.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.221
- Better mind
your own business.

35:17.305 --> 35:20.224
- How's that?
- Ask the Major.

35:20.600 --> 35:24.228
- Major Harrison denies us the right
to make purchases in his store.

35:24.312 --> 35:25.813
- Oh?

35:25.896 --> 35:28.232
Now, that ain't right, is it?
- Oh,no.

35:28.316 --> 35:31.152
- That's what I say.
Be right back. Easy...

35:31.235 --> 35:33.195
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

35:33.279 --> 35:35.031
- He's wearing a star.

35:35.781 --> 35:37.825
- Hold it, there.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.245
Give him what
he asked for.

35:41.662 --> 35:43.748
- You're kiddin', I hope.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.291
- No.

35:55.885 --> 35:58.346
Load it up on the wagon,
and fast.

36:20.159 --> 36:23.037
- The Major ain't gonna
like this.

36:35.341 --> 36:37.968
- What were you sayin'
about the Major?

37:00.491 --> 37:01.784
Hey,you.

37:10.835 --> 37:12.002
- Get him!

37:27.977 --> 37:28.978
- Hey.

37:47.788 --> 37:49.415
- About time someone
took care of it.

37:49.498 --> 37:50.916
- Hey, what's your name, Deputy?

37:51.000 --> 37:54.420
Hey, you gonna stay on
as sheriff?

37:54.503 --> 37:57.298
- He don't talk much,
that's for sure.

37:58.507 --> 38:00.259
- Hey, Deputy!

38:00.342 --> 38:02.678
Hey, ain't you gonna
stop and talk a minute?

38:35.085 --> 38:37.087
- Here, there's
one jack too many.

38:37.171 --> 38:40.132
- No, here, there's
one Major too many.

38:42.176 --> 38:45.012
Look, Major, it'd be nice
if you told your men

38:45.095 --> 38:46.931
not to bother
the farmers anymore.

38:49.183 --> 38:52.186
It ain't nice to hurt
peaceful people like that.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.813
Now, if your men
keep it up,

38:53.896 --> 38:55.481
I'm gonna have to
get 'em where it hurts.

38:55.564 --> 38:58.400
- You sure about that?
- Positive.

38:59.193 --> 39:01.904
- Ahh,ahh,ahh, oh!

39:03.572 --> 39:05.741
- One store destroyed,

39:05.825 --> 39:08.494
three heads split
like overripe melons,

39:08.577 --> 39:11.956
one man wounded, and one
castrated, all in two hours.

39:12.039 --> 39:15.209
Just two hours I left you
alone-— two hours.

39:15.751 --> 39:17.795
- Well, you asked me
to give you a hand.

39:18.003 --> 39:19.630
- Not like that,
beetle brain!

39:20.047 --> 39:22.842
- If you'd only seen
those girls' eyes...

39:24.927 --> 39:27.054
They looked like
two frightened fawns.

39:27.429 --> 39:29.557
- Two frightened fawns-

39:29.640 --> 39:32.977
they were probably two sluts
lookin' for customers.

39:36.856 --> 39:38.691
Hey, where are you goin'?
- To the fawns.

39:38.774 --> 39:40.526
- No, you're comin' with me.
- Where?

39:40.609 --> 39:43.404
- Home to get your rags
and leave.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.990
- Well, thank you, Sheriff.
- You're welcome.

39:46.073 --> 39:48.450
- This was a quiet town
before you came--

39:48.534 --> 39:50.578
disgusting town, but quiet.

39:50.661 --> 39:52.580
- Are you tellin' me?

39:52.663 --> 39:55.207
- Sheriff, what are we gonna
do about his prisoners?

39:55.291 --> 39:57.543
Do we hang 'em,
or do we throw 'em out?

39:57.626 --> 39:59.628
I quit. I'm not gonna
work for them no more.

39:59.712 --> 40:00.880
- Ahh, throw 'em out,

40:00.963 --> 40:04.008
all of 'em, including
that Mexican jumping bean.

40:04.174 --> 40:06.051
- Oh, come on, Bambino,
no sense holding a grudge.

40:06.135 --> 40:08.888
- Don't call me Bambino.
- Want me to call ya Sheriff?

40:08.971 --> 40:12.182
- Don't call me at all,
not even if you're drownin'.

40:12.266 --> 40:13.058
- Hey, with what authority

40:13.142 --> 40:14.393
are you throwin' me
out of town?

40:14.476 --> 40:16.270
- Authority of the law.

40:16.353 --> 40:19.607
- I wouldn't talk about
the law if I were you.

40:19.690 --> 40:22.276
- What's that supposed
to mean?

40:23.402 --> 40:26.238
- Well, uh, remember,
you're not a real sheriff,

40:26.322 --> 40:29.241
just a common horse thief, and
not a very good one at that.

40:29.325 --> 40:32.202
- Evening, Sheriff.
- Hey, keep quiet.

40:35.122 --> 40:36.790
So?

40:36.874 --> 40:40.753
- I'm stayin', and
with this pinned on.

40:42.338 --> 40:44.840
And a dollar a day
plus meals.

40:47.968 --> 40:50.512
- That sounds like blackmail.
- Yeah, it does.

40:52.514 --> 40:55.059
- All right,
you stool pigeon.

40:55.142 --> 40:59.063
But if you start one more
mess, you'd better disappear.

41:01.774 --> 41:03.859
The deputy sleeps
in the office.

41:06.570 --> 41:09.239
- Hi, there, Sheriff.
- Shut up.

41:09.323 --> 41:11.867
- Hey, Sheriff--
oh, it's you.

41:16.622 --> 41:19.959
Out for trouble again, I see.
- Oh, I'm a peaceful man.

41:21.293 --> 41:22.670
- Where ya goin'?

41:22.753 --> 41:26.423
- The saloon, just a little
nip before goin' to bed.

41:26.507 --> 41:29.426
- Like to believe that.
- How about it?

41:29.510 --> 41:32.721
Have one on me.
- Only one?

41:32.805 --> 41:35.975
- Well, forget it, then.
- Forget it, he”.

41:39.269 --> 41:43.857
- Well, looks like the deputy
sheriff is layin' low tonight, huh?

41:44.775 --> 41:47.695
- First chance I get,
I'll fix him for good.

41:47.778 --> 41:48.529
- Yeah.

41:48.612 --> 41:50.698
- That dirty son of an old-
- Don't try it.

41:50.781 --> 41:52.491
He's quicker than
a rattlesnake.

41:52.574 --> 41:56.161
- Don't like the comparison,
but your friend's got a point.

41:56.245 --> 41:58.914
Don't try it.

42:08.799 --> 42:11.176
- Let's get outta here.

42:50.549 --> 42:52.926
- Never a night somethin'
doesn't happen.

43:13.781 --> 43:15.449
- I don't think I like that.

43:15.532 --> 43:18.077
- What did you say
about my old lady?

43:18.160 --> 43:20.621
- You' re “CNN
to ska“ a fight.

43:21.955 --> 43:24.374
- I asked you a question.
What did you say

43:24.458 --> 43:27.294
about my old lady?
- You heard it.

43:28.504 --> 43:31.715
- Well, say it again.
Don't be afraid.

43:32.299 --> 43:34.718
- Afraid of you?

43:37.805 --> 43:39.139
Huh?

43:42.518 --> 43:45.062
Afraid you got more
cheek than brain.

43:53.445 --> 43:56.532
- Hey, Sheriff, wake up!

43:57.241 --> 43:59.451
Sheriff!
Sheriff, wake up!

43:59.660 --> 44:01.495
Open in the name of the law!

44:01.912 --> 44:03.997
It's me, Jonathan!

44:04.248 --> 44:05.249
- Oh!

44:05.332 --> 44:08.544
- You better get your hide
over to the saloon right away!

44:08.627 --> 44:12.548
- What's happening now?
- Your brother is over there.

44:12.881 --> 44:15.300
- Huh?
They killed him?

44:15.384 --> 44:18.303
- Well, he was still standing
when I left.

44:18.387 --> 44:21.181
But they'll make a sieve out of him
if you don't hurry!

44:21.265 --> 44:23.308
- Yeah.

44:24.309 --> 44:25.811
- Seven of us, Deputy,

44:25.894 --> 44:29.189
and you're only holdin'
six bullets in your gun.

44:29.481 --> 44:32.609
Now, I don't know
if I make myself clear.

44:33.277 --> 44:35.320
- Better pay
your bar bill now.

44:35.404 --> 44:38.031
Don't wanna leave
any debts behind.

44:38.115 --> 44:40.367
Now, I don't know
if I made myself clear.

44:40.450 --> 44:42.870
- Hurry, Sheriff.
- Yeah,yeah.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.708
What's goin' on here?

44:47.875 --> 44:49.501
- They offended the law.

44:50.711 --> 44:52.171
- Law?

44:52.671 --> 44:54.173
- Yes.

44:54.256 --> 44:57.009
They said I was
a son of an old...

44:58.510 --> 45:00.721
- That is serious.

45:01.013 --> 45:03.348
How are we gonna
settle that, boys?

45:03.473 --> 45:06.727
- If you didn't care to hide
behind that piece of tin,

45:06.810 --> 45:09.563
we could settle this
among men.

45:12.357 --> 45:14.401
- Aren't you gonna
take it off?

45:14.484 --> 45:16.486
They are only nine.

45:20.699 --> 45:22.326
- Jonathan!
- Ahh!

45:22.409 --> 45:24.369
- Take the guns.

45:32.085 --> 45:33.754
- Here you go.

45:35.672 --> 45:37.132
- Here.

45:42.846 --> 45:44.932
Close the door.

45:48.101 --> 45:49.686
Lock it!

46:01.823 --> 46:04.076
- You gonna
handle it alone?

46:08.038 --> 46:10.666
- I just woke up.
You take your share.

46:13.502 --> 46:16.129
- Wasn't a very bright idea,
my friend.

46:19.508 --> 46:20.968
- Get him.
Get him.

46:22.219 --> 46:23.637
- Stop it.

46:24.721 --> 46:26.223
- Push him.
- Oh!

46:27.140 --> 46:28.642
- Hey, let me-
let me go.

46:29.268 --> 46:30.852
- Oh!

46:48.704 --> 46:49.871
- No.

46:52.708 --> 46:53.709
- Can I go to bed,

46:53.792 --> 46:55.836
or you got somethin' else
planned for tonight?

46:55.919 --> 46:58.213
- Well, I really came
for a drink.

47:01.300 --> 47:04.261
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
let them call ma an old-

47:04.344 --> 47:05.721
- But it's true.

47:06.221 --> 47:08.515
- Yeah, but she ain't that old.

47:12.102 --> 47:14.229
- Ain't you got
no ambition in life?

47:14.313 --> 47:16.064
Do somethin'.
Rustle cattle, hold up

47:16.148 --> 47:19.943
a stagecoach, or play cards,
or somethin'.

47:20.027 --> 47:23.363
Once, you were a good
card shark, but do somethin'.

47:23.447 --> 47:27.075
- Who's got the time?
I'm already busy doin' nothin'.

47:59.107 --> 48:00.442
Who are they?

48:00.567 --> 48:02.819
- They're the farmers
the Major wants out.

48:03.737 --> 48:07.491
- How come they're not armed?
- Oh, it's part of their religion.

48:07.824 --> 48:10.535
They don't believe in violence.
- Huh?

48:10.619 --> 48:12.371
- Oh, it's somethin'
like that.

48:12.454 --> 48:14.748
- Well, how do they manage
with the Major after 'em?

48:14.831 --> 48:17.584
- Oh, with some prayers
and broken bones.

48:21.838 --> 48:23.673
- Welcome, brothers!

48:26.718 --> 48:28.345
- Hey, who told him
we were brothers?

48:28.428 --> 48:30.138
- Hmm? Not me.

48:30.472 --> 48:32.099
- It is the Lord
that sends you!

48:32.474 --> 48:35.394
- Truth is, we was just
passin' by!

48:35.560 --> 48:38.438
- Then, come!
Come join us, brothers!

48:59.376 --> 49:02.170
Get off your horses
and rest a while.

49:06.925 --> 49:09.177
It was good of you to come.

49:09.261 --> 49:12.431
We are truly indebted to you
for having aided our sisters,

49:12.514 --> 49:14.057
Sarah and Judith.

49:14.516 --> 49:17.727
They were innocent doves
surrounded by evil,

49:17.853 --> 49:20.689
but the Lord heard their prayers
and sent you to answer them.

49:20.772 --> 49:23.650
- Yeah, it was approximately
like that.

49:24.317 --> 49:26.778
- Sure is peaceful
around here.

49:26.862 --> 49:28.864
Just like paradise.

49:29.322 --> 49:31.616
- And it is.
For that reason,

49:31.700 --> 49:34.202
we wouldn't want the Major
to contaminate it.

49:34.369 --> 49:35.829
- You're right.

49:36.413 --> 49:37.497
- You would honor us

49:37.581 --> 49:39.416
if you would share
our meager meal with us.

49:39.666 --> 49:41.418
- Wanna share?

49:47.674 --> 49:49.092
- Come.

50:02.731 --> 50:04.816
- Wash your hands first.
- Right.

50:19.080 --> 50:21.291
- Your guns, brothers.
- What?

50:21.708 --> 50:24.085
- It is best not to sit
at the Lord's table

50:24.169 --> 50:26.379
with symbols of violence.

50:28.340 --> 50:31.551
- Thank you, brother.
- Don't take 'em far away.

50:34.012 --> 50:35.347
- Let us pray.

50:43.104 --> 50:44.439
Dear Lord,

50:44.689 --> 50:47.150
we are grateful
to you for these thy gifts,

50:47.234 --> 50:51.112
which we are about to receive
through your infinite goodness.

50:52.322 --> 50:54.824
And, Lord, we ask you
to bless and protect

50:54.908 --> 50:57.744
our brethren who are not
with us at this time.

50:57.827 --> 51:00.413
Amen.
- Amen.

51:00.705 --> 51:02.290
- Amen.

51:22.310 --> 51:23.853
Mm-hmm.

51:25.313 --> 51:26.982
- Hey, pass the bread
down this way.

51:27.065 --> 51:28.441
- Well, look at that.

51:38.034 --> 51:39.244
- Oh.

51:41.496 --> 51:43.248
- Yahoo!

51:47.085 --> 51:49.337
- All the children and sisters
leave, quickly.

51:57.262 --> 51:59.889
I beg you to forgive
their rudeness.

51:59.973 --> 52:02.976
They're like misguided children
who know not what they do.

52:12.652 --> 52:14.112
- Hey!

52:29.002 --> 52:31.713
Brother Tobias!
My gringo.

52:34.257 --> 52:36.635
We were passing by
when I say to my men,

52:36.843 --> 52:39.679
"why don't we go to pay a visit
to my friend, Tobias?"

52:39.763 --> 52:41.348
Right?
- Right.

52:41.931 --> 52:42.849
- If you care to join us.

52:42.932 --> 52:45.101
- No, don't insist, brother.

52:45.185 --> 52:49.022
I don't like to take advantage
of your hospitality every day.

52:49.105 --> 52:50.023
- Thank you, brother Mezcal,

52:50.106 --> 52:51.900
but you're always welcome
to share our table.

52:51.983 --> 52:55.153
- Ahh, Si, well, then
we'll take advantage.

52:59.407 --> 53:00.867
Hombre!

53:02.035 --> 53:04.162
Why don't you remind me
to take off my holster?

53:04.996 --> 53:06.665
Don't you know brother Tobias

53:06.790 --> 53:09.042
doesn't like to see guns
at his table?

53:10.460 --> 53:12.170
Well, now you know.
- Your guns, brothers.

53:12.253 --> 53:14.589
- How about the knife?
- Here.

53:16.383 --> 53:18.843
- Thank you, brother.
- Here's another.

53:20.095 --> 53:22.472
Bring the wine!
- Si, Señor.

53:23.098 --> 53:24.641
- Quiet, everybody.
Now,

53:24.724 --> 53:27.268
I make a toast
to brother Tobias.

53:27.852 --> 53:30.021
I said wine, not water.

53:30.271 --> 53:32.315
Where's the wine?
- I'm sorry, brother.

53:32.399 --> 53:34.859
It's against-
- Where's the wine?!

53:35.485 --> 53:37.070
Where's the wine?

53:38.738 --> 53:41.157
Get them in line!
Vamonos, cabron!

53:41.241 --> 53:43.410
You, too!
- Everybody get in line.

53:43.493 --> 53:45.995
- You're too slow!
- Arriba!

53:47.914 --> 53:49.582
- Not you, stupid.

54:00.260 --> 54:02.345
You no drink wine, eh?

54:05.598 --> 54:09.561
All right, you don't drink
wine, but you make love, no?

54:09.686 --> 54:11.813
No?
Cabron!

54:14.691 --> 54:16.151
- Wait, brother,
wait, please.

54:16.234 --> 54:18.737
- You are not my brother
no more!

54:20.488 --> 54:22.115
I think this one make love.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.409
Bueno, the other side now.

54:27.662 --> 54:29.831
- How dare you hit
one of my brothers?

54:31.166 --> 54:34.836
Ask forgiveness.
- Forgiveness, please.

54:34.919 --> 54:37.839
- Hey, where are you going?
- Turn the other cheek.

54:54.272 --> 54:57.233
This one is new to me.
He's very pretty.

54:57.901 --> 55:00.945
Like this.
You, give me room.

55:37.232 --> 55:39.150
Hit him.

55:41.027 --> 55:42.946
- Me?
- Hmm.

55:58.002 --> 55:59.504
- We go away now, huh?

56:04.342 --> 56:06.928
- Brother, I tried to warn you

56:07.011 --> 56:09.848
that my two guests here
belong to another belief.

56:09.931 --> 56:11.349
They rigidly observe the law

56:11.432 --> 56:14.060
of an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.

56:14.143 --> 56:17.230
I'd say that you forgive them
and return some other time.

56:17.313 --> 56:19.232
- Si, Si.

56:22.443 --> 56:24.821
I kill him, gringo.
- Bueno, bueno, patron.

56:27.156 --> 56:31.077
- I swear...
Mezcal don't forget this!

56:31.828 --> 56:33.788
- Yeah, I can believe it.

56:36.666 --> 56:38.585
- Hee-yah!
- Hah!

56:49.137 --> 56:51.180
- Brother Tobias,
that was so brave.

56:51.264 --> 56:53.099
- Are they really gone?

56:59.230 --> 57:01.357
- Now, you can help yourselves.
You have their guns.

57:01.441 --> 57:02.400
If Mezcal comes back,

57:02.483 --> 57:04.193
one bullet in the fire
will change his mind.

57:04.277 --> 57:06.404
- The Lord giveth life
and the Lord taketh.

57:06.487 --> 57:08.865
Our weapons are
faith and love.

57:09.282 --> 57:11.242
- Well spoken,
brother Tobias.

57:11.910 --> 57:14.203
Only love shall
combat evil.

57:14.537 --> 57:16.039
- It is the sacred word.

57:16.164 --> 57:19.667
"From my body, you shall have
the heat to warm your blood."

57:19.751 --> 57:23.171
- "And from my breast, drink
the nectar to quench thy thirst.

57:23.254 --> 57:24.464
"And from my lips,

57:24.589 --> 57:27.842
"you shall hear only words
of love for the Lord."

57:28.760 --> 57:30.303
- Thus spake Ezekiel.

57:30.470 --> 57:32.263
- He was damn right.

57:33.514 --> 57:35.934
- Your guns, brothers.
- Oh, and your hat, brother.

57:36.017 --> 57:36.893
- Thank you.

57:37.018 --> 57:39.062
- Uh, if you need me-
- Us.

57:39.520 --> 57:42.482
- If you need us,
you know where we are.

57:55.954 --> 57:57.205
Get movin'.

58:05.380 --> 58:06.965
- Yah!

58:23.022 --> 58:24.440
- God is with us.

58:35.910 --> 58:38.621
- Evening, Jonathan.
- Go to hell.

58:39.163 --> 58:41.624
He'll leave tomorrow.
Just passing through.

58:41.708 --> 58:43.209
In a pig's ear he is.

58:43.292 --> 58:45.253
He'll stay for the rest
of his life.

58:45.336 --> 58:49.090
And from what's going on,
that won't be too long.

58:49.173 --> 58:53.428
Disgusting-
disgusting people.

58:54.012 --> 58:57.890
Only safe thing left to do
is blow your brains out.

58:59.183 --> 59:01.185
All right,
come and get it.

59:01.269 --> 59:04.063
- That Mexican is so drunk
he can't stand up.

59:04.147 --> 59:06.649
- Oh, he's fine.
He seemed a little sick before,

59:06.733 --> 59:08.276
so I gave him
a couple of drops of whiskey.

59:08.359 --> 59:10.737
- Well, wasn't that
mighty nice of you?

59:10.820 --> 59:13.990
- I think so, but I always say
everything wrong around here.

59:14.073 --> 59:16.117
- Oh, shut up.

59:17.577 --> 59:19.579
- Yeah, look at them.
Go on, eat my pork.

59:19.662 --> 59:21.497
Go on, eat up.
Huh.

59:21.873 --> 59:24.292
Who knows?
It may be your last meal.

59:24.959 --> 59:25.960
- Why?

59:29.338 --> 59:31.632
- 'Cause I saw
two new faces in town.

59:31.716 --> 59:34.552
Ooh, real ugly.

59:34.635 --> 59:36.512
And they don't promise
any good.

59:36.596 --> 59:38.556
- Oh.

59:42.852 --> 59:46.022
Where are you goin'?
- To welcome them strangers.

59:46.272 --> 59:48.316
- I thought you said
you weren't lookin' for trouble.

59:49.233 --> 59:50.943
- I don't like people
with ugly faces.

59:51.027 --> 59:54.030
- Get the itch outta
your finger and stay put.

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.674
- Hmm.

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:18.221
What would humanity have
come to without the horse?

01:00:19.639 --> 01:00:22.850
The great Caesar,
Alexander the Great,

01:00:23.434 --> 01:00:25.603
the greats of Spain-—

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.525
would they really have been
great without the horse?

01:00:35.404 --> 01:00:37.615
Would this nation ever
have been born

01:00:37.698 --> 01:00:40.827
without the generous help
of that noble animal?

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:43.246
Now, what is the best way
to pay our debt

01:00:43.329 --> 01:00:46.457
if not to offer them a quiet,
green pasture

01:00:46.541 --> 01:00:49.669
where they can eat
and procreate in peace?

01:00:51.379 --> 01:00:54.132
Therefore, I want
that valley

01:00:54.298 --> 01:00:56.300
at any cost.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:01.556
And if you convince
the farmers to leave,

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:06.227
I'll make it so worth your while
you'll be able to retire.

01:01:07.061 --> 01:01:09.188
- That valley is
already yours, Major.

01:01:09.272 --> 01:01:10.815
- Good.

01:01:11.691 --> 01:01:12.984
First, however,

01:01:13.067 --> 01:01:16.779
I'd like you to take care of
the sheriff and his deputy.

01:01:17.071 --> 01:01:20.449
Their, uh, zeal is
positively disturbing.

01:01:20.616 --> 01:01:24.120
- You can start electing
a new sheriff as of now.

01:01:24.203 --> 01:01:26.205
- That I will.

01:01:27.707 --> 01:01:29.625
You care for some sherry?

01:01:31.794 --> 01:01:33.921
It's wine, the best.

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:37.508
- Uh, no, thank you, Major,
not while working.

01:01:39.218 --> 01:01:42.680
- That's what I call
professional seriousness.

01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:48.769
I advise you
to watch the deputy.

01:01:48.853 --> 01:01:50.479
He's very fast.

01:01:51.355 --> 01:01:53.191
- You hear that, Mortimer?

01:01:53.274 --> 01:01:56.569
The Major says the deputy
is very fast.

01:02:01.824 --> 01:02:04.577
- Oh, yeah!
- All right, come on, let's go.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.245
You come this way.

01:02:45.743 --> 01:02:48.704
- Where are you goin'?
- Out- take a look around.

01:02:48.788 --> 01:02:50.539
- It's a quiet day today.

01:02:50.623 --> 01:02:53.292
See that it ends up
the way it started.

01:03:40.256 --> 01:03:41.799
- Wait 'till Jack
gets a hold of him.

01:03:41.882 --> 01:03:43.175
- Yeah.

01:04:10.161 --> 01:04:13.331
- That's the fast deputy,
Mortimer.

01:04:24.008 --> 01:04:25.634
- Hmm.

01:04:34.226 --> 01:04:37.063
- Can I help you
with somethin', Deputy?

01:04:48.824 --> 01:04:52.161
Anything in particular
you're interested in?

01:04:52.244 --> 01:04:55.206
- Uh, yeah. Would you mind
showing me your underwear?

01:05:05.716 --> 01:05:08.177
- Hey, what about the horses?
- There's no time!

01:05:09.637 --> 01:05:11.347
He said ten seconds!

01:05:45.423 --> 01:05:48.467
- I suppose you got nothin'
to do with this, right?

01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:54.432
- Sheriff, this was
a peaceful town

01:05:54.515 --> 01:05:56.559
before this madman
came here.

01:05:56.642 --> 01:05:59.353
Now, he can't go around hittin'
and shootin' our good citizens

01:05:59.437 --> 01:06:02.022
just because
you gave him that star.

01:06:02.106 --> 01:06:05.484
In the name of this community,
I demand your resignation

01:06:05.568 --> 01:06:07.319
and your deputy's,
or I shall be forced

01:06:07.403 --> 01:06:11.073
to speak to my personal
friend, the governor.

01:06:11.157 --> 01:06:13.742
- Uh-huh, all right.

01:06:15.995 --> 01:06:18.497
- We can't let him
get away with it, Major.

01:06:18.581 --> 01:06:19.707
- Hmm.

01:06:23.419 --> 01:06:26.005
- Damn the day you ever
came into the world.

01:06:26.088 --> 01:06:29.508
You're worse than the black
plague and a leprechaun.

01:06:33.721 --> 01:06:35.139
- For the umpteenth time,

01:06:35.222 --> 01:06:37.224
what do you want me to do
with that Mexican?

01:06:37.308 --> 01:06:40.853
- Oh, throw him out.
- But he can't stand up.

01:06:41.312 --> 01:06:44.982
- Give him some whiskey.
It'll make him go to sleep.

01:06:52.698 --> 01:06:54.658
- Somethin' the matter?

01:06:54.867 --> 01:06:58.412
- Nothin' important--
there's a reward out for me.

01:06:59.121 --> 01:07:02.708
The new sheriff I took
this star from, he ain't dead.

01:07:02.791 --> 01:07:06.754
He's lame. He's lookin'
for me all over the state.

01:07:07.296 --> 01:07:11.175
Now, he wants me
to give him a hand to find me.

01:07:19.141 --> 01:07:20.893
- Hey, $200.

01:07:22.728 --> 01:07:24.813
- You thinkin' of sellin'
your own brother?

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:28.734
- That's an insult.

01:07:28.817 --> 01:07:31.111
I'd never do such a thing
for only 200 bucks.

01:07:33.864 --> 01:07:35.282
- Wanna come with me?

01:07:37.409 --> 01:07:38.536
- Where?

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.038
- Hmm.

01:07:42.706 --> 01:07:44.291
- You're takin' advantage
because you know I'd never

01:07:44.375 --> 01:07:46.877
shoot you, right?
- Sure.

01:07:48.837 --> 01:07:51.006
Why in the he”
don't you wise up?

01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:53.300
Go back to New Orleans
to Mama.

01:07:53.384 --> 01:07:56.971
Bring her a couple of girls
and go into business with her.

01:07:58.514 --> 01:08:00.724
Now, beat it.
Move!

01:08:01.475 --> 01:08:04.937
- Well, so long.
Hope to see ya again someday.

01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:07.189
- I don't.

01:08:35.843 --> 01:08:38.679
- If I really wanted
to stay, I would!

01:08:41.724 --> 01:08:43.267
- I don't think so!

01:09:30.606 --> 01:09:32.691
- Helen, come and help me!

01:09:37.446 --> 01:09:39.865
- Billy, you get it.
- I'll have it ready in a few seconds.

01:09:41.533 --> 01:09:42.785
- Hand me that ax.

01:09:42.868 --> 01:09:44.745
Myrtle, get this kid
back to the wagon, will ya?

01:09:44.828 --> 01:09:46.497
He's always in the way.

01:09:47.997 --> 01:09:50.459
- It's good to see you
again, brother.

01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:52.461
What breeze
brings you here?

01:09:52.544 --> 01:09:55.506
- Well, actually,
weren't no breeze.

01:09:55.589 --> 01:09:56.548
I'm goin' home.

01:09:56.632 --> 01:09:58.175
Just passin' through
to say goodbye.

01:09:59.051 --> 01:10:01.095
- You've been
our guardian angel.

01:10:01.178 --> 01:10:03.305
May the Lord be with you.
But if you should choose

01:10:03.389 --> 01:10:06.141
to remain with us, my son,
you're more than welcome.

01:10:06.225 --> 01:10:09.019
- Thank you,but
I really have to go.

01:10:10.187 --> 01:10:12.022
- It's a pity.
- Hmm.

01:10:12.106 --> 01:10:14.108
- Well, as you wish.

01:10:14.692 --> 01:10:17.069
But before you leave,
I know

01:10:17.236 --> 01:10:19.738
that Sarah and Judith would
like to thank you personally.

01:10:20.447 --> 01:10:21.949
They're down by the creek.

01:10:22.157 --> 01:10:23.784
- Oh, down by the creek?

01:10:23.909 --> 01:10:25.911
- I'll get someone
to fetch them.

01:10:26.036 --> 01:10:28.914
- Ah, don't bother, chief.
I'll be going by that way.

01:10:28.997 --> 01:10:30.749
- They'll be happy
to see you.

01:10:48.559 --> 01:10:51.145
- Oh, look, it's Trinity!
- Hi!

01:10:51.228 --> 01:10:53.689
- Welcome, brother!
- Howdy!

01:10:54.064 --> 01:10:57.317
- Come on in!
- Hey, the water is fine!

01:10:57.401 --> 01:10:58.694
Come on!

01:11:06.785 --> 01:11:08.746
- Hey, it's marvelous.
Come on in.

01:11:09.204 --> 01:11:11.707
- The water is warm.
Don't be afraid.

01:11:14.626 --> 01:11:16.879
- Come on.
Don't be a sissy.

01:11:17.921 --> 01:11:20.466
Oh, he's comin' in,
horse and all.

01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:24.720
Hey, the invitation
didn't include your horse.

01:11:24.887 --> 01:11:26.346
- Well, he can swim.
I can't.

01:11:27.681 --> 01:11:29.725
- But the water is only
up to here.

01:11:29.808 --> 01:11:31.727
- Oh, well,
in that case...

01:11:34.396 --> 01:11:36.440
- What is he doing?

01:11:44.698 --> 01:11:47.367
You know, when we saw you
for the first time,

01:11:47.451 --> 01:11:49.244
we thought that
it would've been wonderful

01:11:49.328 --> 01:11:50.788
if you joined
our community.

01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:54.124
- Yeah, it kinda
passed my mind, too.

01:11:57.419 --> 01:12:00.088
- You could've lived with us.
Made a home with devoted

01:12:00.172 --> 01:12:02.716
wives to take care of you
and serve you.

01:12:03.175 --> 01:12:05.761
- Wives?
- Uh-huh, wives.

01:12:05.844 --> 01:12:07.513
- Didn't you know our faith
accepts the state

01:12:07.596 --> 01:12:09.932
or fact of polygamy?

01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:12.434
- Huh?

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:38.877
Hey, it's gettin' deeper.

01:12:49.012 --> 01:12:51.723
- Before we start shingling,
we better raise the chimney.

01:12:51.807 --> 01:12:53.350
- You're right, brother.

01:12:53.559 --> 01:12:55.477
- Help me, brother.

01:13:03.986 --> 01:13:05.821
- Yeah, right.

01:13:07.239 --> 01:13:08.991
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:13:19.126 --> 01:13:20.836
- You'll be leavin'
right away?

01:13:20.919 --> 01:13:24.256
- Well, if the invitation
still stands,

01:13:24.339 --> 01:13:26.425
we thought we'd stay on
for a day or so.

01:13:26.508 --> 01:13:27.676
- By all means.

01:13:27.759 --> 01:13:30.387
Whatever is ours
is yours to share.

01:13:36.393 --> 01:13:39.229
- Ahh, chh-chh-chh.
Ahh, chh-chh-chh.

01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:42.608
- There's no way
to stop the Major?

01:13:43.358 --> 01:13:45.360
- He ain't the type
to give in.

01:13:45.444 --> 01:13:48.405
He'll come chargin' down here
before you know it.

01:13:48.488 --> 01:13:51.074
- Our fate is in the hands
of the Lord.

01:13:51.158 --> 01:13:52.451
- Yeah, but he doesn't
carry a gun either.

01:13:52.534 --> 01:13:56.371
Can't get much help there.
Look, I don't think

01:13:56.455 --> 01:13:58.749
the Lord would take it wrong
if you defend yourselves.

01:13:58.832 --> 01:14:00.751
- We cannot kill
our fellow man.

01:14:01.335 --> 01:14:03.045
- But they ain't
your fellow man.

01:14:03.128 --> 01:14:05.505
They're lower
than rattlesnakes.

01:14:05.589 --> 01:14:08.759
You can't go on turnin'
the other cheek forever.

01:14:08.842 --> 01:14:10.969
- We shall see
what God wills.

01:14:11.053 --> 01:14:13.639
- I hope he wills
a couple of guns.

01:14:13.722 --> 01:14:16.224
You could get rid of
the whole bunch.

01:14:16.308 --> 01:14:18.518
A few at a time,
of course.

01:14:19.102 --> 01:14:22.272
Listen, I suggest that-—

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.278
- Hey, look.

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.242
- Hey, Ma, there's
two strangers here!

01:14:46.463 --> 01:14:48.840
- Who might they
be, brother?

01:14:49.383 --> 01:14:52.427
- Judging from appearances,
I'd say they were

01:14:52.511 --> 01:14:54.471
wayfarers tired from
a long journey.

01:14:54.554 --> 01:14:58.141
- Or two outlaws
escaping across the desert.

01:14:58.225 --> 01:15:00.602
- Also, the Lord
crossed the desert.

01:15:00.686 --> 01:15:05.148
- Yeah, but he didn't have
the U.S. Rangers on his tail.

01:15:05.232 --> 01:15:07.859
Go see what they want.
If they start making trouble,

01:15:07.943 --> 01:15:09.653
I'll be right behind you.

01:15:35.721 --> 01:15:36.972
- May I?

01:15:37.055 --> 01:15:40.559
- "Give drink to the thirsty,"
says the Holy Word.

01:15:53.947 --> 01:15:55.657
- If I'm not mistaken,

01:15:55.741 --> 01:15:58.160
it also says to give food
to the hungry, right?

01:15:58.243 --> 01:15:59.911
- Wrong.

01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:08.170
You're Weasel,
ain't ya?

01:16:09.546 --> 01:16:11.214
- Yeah.

01:16:15.719 --> 01:16:17.304
- And you're Timmy.

01:16:19.097 --> 01:16:22.267
And you're lookin'
for the Bambino.

01:16:22.934 --> 01:16:25.103
- You wouldn't know
where he's been, huh?

01:16:25.353 --> 01:16:27.814
- Yeah, waitin' for you
to get here.

01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:35.781
- What in the hell are you
up to now?

01:16:36.698 --> 01:16:38.033
- Hey, boss!

01:16:38.492 --> 01:16:41.244
- I've been rottin' here
for weeks waitin' for ya.

01:16:41.328 --> 01:16:44.706
I was beginning to think
they strung you both up.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.793
- We were sidetracked
out on the trail.

01:16:48.418 --> 01:16:50.962
We saw somebody
following us out,

01:16:51.463 --> 01:16:54.966
so we detoured around the canyon
and shot him off his horse.

01:16:55.133 --> 01:16:57.969
It was a sheriff,
a lame-legged sheriff.

01:16:58.053 --> 01:16:59.137
He weren't really
lookin' for us.

01:16:59.221 --> 01:17:01.807
We just happened to be
goin' the same way.

01:17:01.890 --> 01:17:03.517
- Did you fix him for good?
- Well, uh-—

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.977
- Well, almost-- Timmy
got him in the good leg.

01:17:06.061 --> 01:17:08.647
Then we broke
his crutches.

01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:10.273
- Yeah.

01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:13.985
- What are you doin'
with that star?

01:17:14.277 --> 01:17:16.113
- Hidin' behind the law.
- Huh?

01:17:16.196 --> 01:17:19.866
- Now, listen to me.
There's a beautiful job for us,

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:22.661
a ripe plum
just waitin' to be picked.

01:17:22.744 --> 01:17:24.037
- Cattle?

01:17:25.789 --> 01:17:27.958
- Steeds.
- Did you hear that?

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:30.502
- Yeah.
- The most gorgeous herd

01:17:30.585 --> 01:17:33.338
of unbranded stallions
you ever seen.

01:17:34.422 --> 01:17:37.425
How'd you know I was here?
- I told them.

01:17:37.759 --> 01:17:40.011
- Oh,no.
- Now, listen a minute, Bambino.

01:17:40.095 --> 01:17:42.347
I don't want-

01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:45.433
- I don't wanna listen.

01:17:51.314 --> 01:17:52.482
- Look, I just wanted
to tell you--

01:17:52.566 --> 01:17:55.569
- Oh, go on, get.
- Hey, hold on.

01:17:55.652 --> 01:17:57.821
- Didn't you hear
what the boss said?

01:17:57.904 --> 01:18:00.031
Hmm?

01:18:06.037 --> 01:18:06.997
- Hey, wait up.
There's somethin' important

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.875
I gotta tell ya.
Comin' to town,

01:18:09.958 --> 01:18:11.751
I saw the Major headin'
for the Mexican border.

01:18:11.835 --> 01:18:14.004
You know what
that means?

01:18:15.005 --> 01:18:18.425
It means that he's gonna
join up with Mezcal.

01:18:18.508 --> 01:18:20.594
Them farmers won't
have a chance.

01:18:27.475 --> 01:18:29.352
Look, if you help me
get rid of the Major,

01:18:29.436 --> 01:18:32.647
I'll, uh, get married.

01:18:32.731 --> 01:18:34.733
- You'll what?
- I'll get married.

01:18:34.816 --> 01:18:37.194
- To who?
- To Sarah or Judith-

01:18:37.277 --> 01:18:39.905
I haven't decided yet.
But I'm gonna settle down

01:18:39.988 --> 01:18:42.157
with the farmers...

01:18:43.283 --> 01:18:45.160
Forever.

01:19:08.934 --> 01:19:12.270
- Forever?
- Yes, forever.

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:17.192
I want to forget the past.
- Hmm?

01:19:27.369 --> 01:19:30.247
Swear on our old lady.

01:19:31.957 --> 01:19:35.460
- May she become an honest
woman if I'm tellin' a lie.

01:19:42.467 --> 01:19:44.678
- All right, it's a deal.

01:19:45.178 --> 01:19:47.347
I'll help you,

01:19:48.598 --> 01:19:51.226
but then we go separate ways,

01:19:51.518 --> 01:19:54.479
or I'll make sure
you really forget the past.

01:19:54.562 --> 01:19:57.649
- Thanks. You won't be sorry.
- Yeah.

01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:02.904
- Uh, listen, about
taking care of the Major.

01:20:02.988 --> 01:20:04.698
I was thinkin'.
- You don't have to think!

01:20:04.781 --> 01:20:08.368
I'll do the thinkin'!
- Exactly what I was thinking.

01:20:12.289 --> 01:20:14.165
Idiot!

01:20:31.808 --> 01:20:34.352
- Oh, that is
the very nice Major.

01:20:34.644 --> 01:20:37.022
He's got a lot of
dinero, muchachos.

01:20:43.945 --> 01:20:45.405
Bienvenido.

01:20:49.784 --> 01:20:51.828
- You sit here,
in the shade, no?

01:20:51.911 --> 01:20:53.371
- Thank you.

01:20:55.081 --> 01:20:56.291
- Fuera, fuera!

01:20:56.374 --> 01:20:59.169
- Buenos Dias, Major.
- You, too!

01:21:00.045 --> 01:21:02.839
So, how is
my worst enemy, huh?

01:21:03.214 --> 01:21:05.300
- Your best friend now.

01:21:05.759 --> 01:21:08.678
- But your men shoot us
just yesterday.

01:21:10.722 --> 01:21:13.975
- You see, Mr. Mezcal,
if you steal my horses,

01:21:14.059 --> 01:21:18.063
I'll have to have you shot.
But if you work for me,

01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:21.149
I'll give them to you,
20 of them,

01:21:21.232 --> 01:21:23.068
for chasing the Mormons
out of the valley.

01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:27.947
- Major, for 20 stallions,
Mezcal conquer Texas.

01:21:28.031 --> 01:21:29.240
But how about the-

01:21:29.324 --> 01:21:32.118
Uh, I mean, is there some way
in particular

01:21:32.202 --> 01:21:34.829
you would like us
to kill those insects, huh?

01:21:34.913 --> 01:21:37.832
- That's your business.
- Yeah.

01:21:37.957 --> 01:21:40.960
There's only one thing
I don't like, Major.

01:21:41.044 --> 01:21:42.212
- And that is?

01:21:42.545 --> 01:21:45.298
- It's that I prefer
to steal the horses.

01:21:45.382 --> 01:21:49.260
Si, I do the job for you, and you
let me steal 20 horses.

01:21:49.636 --> 01:21:51.971
To work for pay
is humiliating.

01:21:52.138 --> 01:21:54.391
Better to steal.
There's more emotion.

01:21:57.394 --> 01:21:59.145
- All right, all right.

01:21:59.396 --> 01:22:03.566
Jeff, tell the men to let
Mr. Mezcal steal 20 horses...

01:22:05.693 --> 01:22:08.029
Without shooting
this time.

01:22:08.113 --> 01:22:10.949
- Muy bien.
Hombre, wine, now.

01:22:11.032 --> 01:22:14.869
Let's drink to
the 20 stallions.

01:22:20.333 --> 01:22:23.628
When do we attack?
- When they expect it least.

01:22:23.711 --> 01:22:25.130
In a few days,
send one of your men

01:22:25.213 --> 01:22:28.049
to look around
and then report back to me.

01:22:28.133 --> 01:22:30.593
- I send Emiliano.
He would be able

01:22:30.677 --> 01:22:34.514
to crawl under your sombrero
without you knowing it.

01:22:38.435 --> 01:22:41.479
- I figure there'll be about
20 of 'em, and every one

01:22:41.563 --> 01:22:44.357
a gunslinger.
So if you don't use

01:22:44.441 --> 01:22:47.944
your guns, they'll make
fertilizer out of you.

01:22:48.027 --> 01:22:50.780
- Our faith
prohibits violence.

01:22:50.864 --> 01:22:52.782
- You don't believe
the four of us can hold off

01:22:52.866 --> 01:22:54.951
the Major's crowd,
do you?

01:22:58.329 --> 01:23:01.458
- We'll have to ask the Lord
for a temporary dispensation.

01:23:01.541 --> 01:23:02.959
- Better get it
in a hurry, brother.

01:23:04.794 --> 01:23:08.298
- Brothers, we must
make this decision now.

01:23:08.381 --> 01:23:10.550
- Yes.
- There's no way out otherwise.

01:23:10.633 --> 01:23:14.053
- All right, but only
for self-defense.

01:23:14.137 --> 01:23:16.639
We will not kill.

01:23:20.852 --> 01:23:23.480
- Well, at least
that's somethin'.

01:23:25.523 --> 01:23:27.400
- Okay, let's get going.

01:23:30.195 --> 01:23:33.239
- All right, line up now.
That's it.

01:23:38.912 --> 01:23:40.538
If someone comes swinging
with his right,

01:23:40.622 --> 01:23:42.957
what do you do?
You block with your left

01:23:43.041 --> 01:23:45.627
and counter with your right.
You.

01:23:48.546 --> 01:23:52.133
I repeat-
block with your left

01:23:52.217 --> 01:23:54.469
and counter with your right.
Got it?

01:23:54.552 --> 01:23:57.347
- Yes, brother.
- All right, let's try it.

01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:04.896
I said block with your left,
not your right.

01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:09.776
- See what happens?
It's a question of timing.

01:24:12.111 --> 01:24:15.114
If someone comes swinging
a pole at you, what do you do?

01:24:15.198 --> 01:24:17.617
- I don't know.
- Well, you duck.

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:19.327
- Yeah.
- Grab him.

01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:21.704
- Yeah.
- And pull him down!

01:24:21.788 --> 01:24:23.665
That clear?
- Yes, brother.

01:24:23.748 --> 01:24:27.126
- Okay, ready?
- Ready.

01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:29.879
Ugh!
- Oh,no.

01:24:29.963 --> 01:24:32.674
Now, watch how it's done.
Watch.

01:24:32.757 --> 01:24:35.552
Now, look at me.

01:24:35.635 --> 01:24:39.556
- Watch this.
- You ready?

01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:41.391
- Ahh!

01:24:45.228 --> 01:24:49.065
- Remember, the most important
thing is to be fast.

01:24:49.774 --> 01:24:51.568
Is that clear?

01:24:53.027 --> 01:24:54.946
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

01:24:55.655 --> 01:24:57.448
- Now, then, when you--

01:24:58.866 --> 01:25:01.077
- Experience is always
the best teacher.

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.496
Now, if you ain't much
at swinging your arms,

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.124
you can always use
your feet, like me.

01:25:06.207 --> 01:25:08.501
- Ow! Oh'
Ow! .

01:25:09.210 --> 01:25:11.045
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:13.881 --> 01:25:16.551
- All right, get up,
and you try now.

01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:23.891
- Ahh!

01:25:24.475 --> 01:25:25.810
- Oh, Pete.

01:25:25.893 --> 01:25:28.479
Easy, brother. Get up.
Up you go.

01:25:30.565 --> 01:25:32.609
- You get him in a lock
and bounce him

01:25:32.734 --> 01:25:33.901
up and down like this.

01:25:35.361 --> 01:25:37.280
- Brother, perhaps you're
going ahead too fast.

01:25:37.363 --> 01:25:39.032
- I have no time
to waste.

01:25:42.201 --> 01:25:45.121
- Don't worry.
He'll be all right.

01:25:46.539 --> 01:25:49.667
- You know, I was just thinking.
- If it's advice, save your breath.

01:25:49.751 --> 01:25:52.629
- It ain't advice.
I only want your opinion.

01:25:55.632 --> 01:25:57.467
- All right, go on.

01:25:58.217 --> 01:26:00.386
- Do you suppose
there's somebody spying on us

01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:02.347
under that sombrero?

01:26:06.434 --> 01:26:07.894
- Then you duck.
- Hmm.

01:26:07.977 --> 01:26:11.522
It's a serious possibility.
- That's what I thought.

01:26:11.773 --> 01:26:13.441
- Weasel!
- When you swing around-—

01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:16.235
- Come here a minute.
- Try it by yourselves.

01:26:16.319 --> 01:26:18.279
- All right, now,
by the numbers.

01:26:18.363 --> 01:26:19.739
Let's try it.

01:26:22.367 --> 01:26:25.078
- I think there's a spy
sittin' under that sombrero

01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:27.914
up there on the hill.
Bring him down...

01:26:28.748 --> 01:26:30.291
Alive.

01:26:39.884 --> 01:26:42.136
- Somethin' wrong, Sheriff?

01:26:42.679 --> 01:26:43.930
- Nothin' important.

01:26:44.013 --> 01:26:46.891
There's only someone
up there on the hill.

01:26:46.974 --> 01:26:49.519
Weasel has gone
to invite him down.

01:26:49.602 --> 01:26:53.564
- Heaven protect our friend.
- Better protect the spy.

01:27:08.788 --> 01:27:11.666
If you're smart, you'll talk.

01:27:11.749 --> 01:27:13.376
Who sent ya?

01:27:13.793 --> 01:27:16.671
- Emiliano doesn't
betray, gringo.

01:27:25.304 --> 01:27:29.308
Emiliano tells everything.
I'm one of Mezcal's men.

01:27:29.684 --> 01:27:33.271
The Major, he said
he promised Mezcal 20 stallions

01:27:33.396 --> 01:27:36.441
if we chase the farmers
out of here.

01:27:58.296 --> 01:28:02.592
- Listen, you ain't goin' ahead
with that plan without me.

01:28:02.675 --> 01:28:05.887
I know you too well.
You're like an open book.

01:28:08.890 --> 01:28:12.393
- Oh, yeah? Then let's see
if you read right.

01:28:14.771 --> 01:28:18.691
- You wanna take the Mexicans'
place, get the 20 horses, and then...

01:28:25.114 --> 01:28:26.866
Am I wrong?

01:28:31.037 --> 01:28:32.538
- You read right.

01:28:32.622 --> 01:28:35.458
I'm glad you're beginning
to use your head.

01:28:37.585 --> 01:28:39.295
Listen, Emiliano,

01:28:39.378 --> 01:28:43.341
would you do us a favor
in exchange for your stinkin' skin?

01:28:43.424 --> 01:28:46.427
- Claro Que Si, hombre.
- That's the spirit.

01:28:52.225 --> 01:28:55.102
- Hold it, right there!
- No, no, don't shoot!

01:28:55.186 --> 01:28:56.604
It's me, Emiliano!

01:28:56.687 --> 01:28:58.815
Mezcal sent us
to steal the horses.

01:28:58.898 --> 01:29:01.025
- All right,
but make it quick.

01:29:07.949 --> 01:29:09.659
- Buenas noches, Señor.

01:29:09.742 --> 01:29:12.119
- Just take your 20 horses
and clear outta here.

01:29:12.203 --> 01:29:14.455
- Si, Si.

01:29:19.544 --> 01:29:21.462
- I'll take the two
white ones.

01:29:22.004 --> 01:29:24.632
- Two, three, four, five.

01:29:24.966 --> 01:29:27.009
- How did it go with the farmers?
- Oh, fine.

01:29:27.093 --> 01:29:28.427
Six.
Muy bien.

01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:31.305
Seven, eight, nine, ten.
- Any killings?

01:29:31.389 --> 01:29:33.474
- Eleven.
Todos muertos.

01:29:33.558 --> 01:29:35.184
- All dead?
- Twelve, thirteen.

01:29:35.268 --> 01:29:38.396
Right-- children, women,
old ladies, all dead.

01:29:38.563 --> 01:29:40.940
Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
- Holy Hannah. Killed 'em all?

01:29:41.023 --> 01:29:42.191
- Seventeen.
Ah, Si.

01:29:42.859 --> 01:29:44.068
Cats, dogs, everybody.

01:29:44.402 --> 01:29:46.487
Eighteen, nineteen.
- What a massacre!

01:29:46.571 --> 01:29:48.573
- Si, it was a nice massacre.

01:29:48.656 --> 01:29:51.659
Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two...
- Hey.

01:29:51.742 --> 01:29:54.245
- ...twenty-three, twenty-four.
- Hey, you were supposed

01:29:54.328 --> 01:29:56.080
to take 20.
- Twenty-five, twenty-six.

01:29:56.163 --> 01:29:57.748
Be quiet or
I lose count, no?

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.751
Thirty, thirty-one,
thirty-two, thirty-three,

01:30:00.835 --> 01:30:02.837
thirty-four, thirty-five.

01:30:05.339 --> 01:30:07.675
- Where is the sheriff?
- Who are you?

01:30:07.758 --> 01:30:09.385
- Who are you?

01:30:10.177 --> 01:30:11.679
- I'm Jonathan Swift.

01:30:11.971 --> 01:30:13.681
I keep the office in order,

01:30:13.764 --> 01:30:15.224
and the sheriff's
gone out of town.

01:30:15.308 --> 01:30:17.685
- He is, huh?
When's he comin' back?

01:30:17.768 --> 01:30:21.188
- Well, that depends.
If he catches 'em,

01:30:21.272 --> 01:30:23.900
he should be back around, uh-—
- Catches who?

01:30:24.775 --> 01:30:27.862
- Horse thieves.
- Are these here the men?

01:30:28.738 --> 01:30:30.448
- Oh, the sheriff.

01:30:30.531 --> 01:30:32.325
- Yeah, there's
a certain similarity.

01:30:32.491 --> 01:30:34.493
- There is?
- That's them.

01:30:34.577 --> 01:30:37.079
That's them.
That really is them.

01:30:37.163 --> 01:30:39.665
- Well, do you know
where they were headed?

01:30:39.749 --> 01:30:42.919
- Listen, well, they told me they
were going to the... border!

01:30:43.002 --> 01:30:44.545
Yeah, remember the border-

01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:46.672
- Nail those there
outside the office.

01:30:46.756 --> 01:30:48.716
- Yes, siree, right away, Sheriff.
- If I ever catch up with them,

01:30:48.799 --> 01:30:50.551
they'll pay for this.
- Yes, siree,

01:30:50.635 --> 01:30:53.471
went to the border.
We'll take care of

01:30:53.554 --> 01:30:56.182
the whole thing, Sheriff.
Don't you worry about-

01:30:56.265 --> 01:30:58.267
Whiskey, whiskey.

01:30:59.644 --> 01:31:01.854
- Up you go.
You,too.

01:31:05.191 --> 01:31:07.652
All the children are loaded
into the wagon, Sheriff.

01:31:07.944 --> 01:31:10.780
- All right, over here!
- Weasel, watch the kids.

01:31:12.323 --> 01:31:13.449
Hear, men--

01:31:14.784 --> 01:31:18.162
take your boys and get around
back of the house.

01:31:19.288 --> 01:31:21.874
- So, you wouldn't know
where Tobias is.

01:31:21.958 --> 01:31:24.377
- I think he went down to
the river with some of his men.

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:25.711
- And the horses?
- Huh?

01:31:25.795 --> 01:31:28.047
- The horses, damn you!
Where'd you put 'em?

01:31:28.130 --> 01:31:30.091
- Oh, the horses.

01:31:30.299 --> 01:31:32.843
They're under cover,
safe and sound.

01:31:32.969 --> 01:31:36.263
- Hey, brother lookout!
You seeing anything?

01:31:37.139 --> 01:31:40.226
- No, brother Sheriff,
nothing!

01:31:44.647 --> 01:31:48.067
I mean, yes!
They're coming!

01:31:48.359 --> 01:31:49.610
They're coming!

01:31:50.528 --> 01:31:51.821
- Get ready.

01:31:53.906 --> 01:31:55.116
Hah!

01:32:17.555 --> 01:32:19.765
- It's old Jonathan!

01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.189
- Whoa.

01:32:28.607 --> 01:32:30.067
Whoa.

01:32:33.446 --> 01:32:35.489
Major is looking
for you, Sheriff.

01:32:35.573 --> 01:32:37.450
- What's he want?

01:32:38.075 --> 01:32:39.827
- Justice, I guess.

01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:41.704
A herd of his horses
was stolen,

01:32:41.787 --> 01:32:43.497
and he wants the help of the law

01:32:43.581 --> 01:32:45.750
to punish the rustlers
and get his horses back.

01:32:46.125 --> 01:32:48.919
- Well, I can't help him now.
- I didn't think so.

01:32:49.336 --> 01:32:51.714
You're not keeping all those
horses for yourself, are ya?

01:32:51.797 --> 01:32:54.675
- What horses?
- What horses?

01:32:54.842 --> 01:32:56.469
The Major's horses.

01:32:56.761 --> 01:32:58.846
- Did you come here
to tell me that?

01:32:58.929 --> 01:33:01.766
- Yeah, among other things.
- Such as?

01:33:02.641 --> 01:33:05.269
- Well, a man came to town
today-—

01:33:06.103 --> 01:33:08.981
Mustache, star on his chest,
crutches,

01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:12.526
a typical crippled sheriff,

01:33:13.027 --> 01:33:15.362
and he was lookin' for the fellas
who made him that way.

01:33:15.988 --> 01:33:18.824
I sent him to the border.
- Good.

01:33:18.908 --> 01:33:20.785
Is that all?
- Oh,no,no,no.

01:33:20.868 --> 01:33:22.995
Uh, the Major will be here
any minute.

01:33:23.829 --> 01:33:25.081
- Thanks, old man.

01:33:25.831 --> 01:33:27.750
- You're welcome.

01:33:28.084 --> 01:33:29.502
I want my share.

01:33:29.668 --> 01:33:31.629
- Yeah, that figures.

01:33:31.712 --> 01:33:33.506
What'd you bring him for?

01:33:33.589 --> 01:33:35.341
- Well, I couldn't
leave him in town.

01:33:35.424 --> 01:33:36.884
Uh, he's got a tendency
to tell the truth.

01:33:36.967 --> 01:33:39.303
He's an alcoholic, you know?

01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:49.563
- Ho!

01:33:50.731 --> 01:33:51.941
- Get these guns.

01:33:52.024 --> 01:33:54.068
Put the Mexican in that wagon
and keep him drunk.

01:33:54.151 --> 01:33:56.862
- Yes, siree, partner.
Hah!

01:34:05.079 --> 01:34:07.414
- Where the devil did Tobias go?
- Tobias?

01:34:07.498 --> 01:34:09.959
- Yeah, Tobias.
- Right there, boss.

01:34:16.799 --> 01:34:18.551
- I thought you ran out on us.

01:34:18.634 --> 01:34:21.303
- No, we were working,
brother, working very hard.

01:34:21.387 --> 01:34:22.680
- That reminds me, boss.

01:34:22.763 --> 01:34:25.307
Shouldn't we start diggin'
a few graves

01:34:25.391 --> 01:34:27.518
now that we have the time?
- A few graves?

01:34:28.018 --> 01:34:30.354
You don't wanna turn this place
into a cemetery, do you?

01:34:30.437 --> 01:34:32.731
- How do you think we're gonna
hold off the Major?

01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.108
- With faith.

01:34:35.442 --> 01:34:36.694
- Hmm.

01:34:37.111 --> 01:34:39.780
- Faith is
an impenetrable fortress.

01:34:40.739 --> 01:34:42.908
As cynical as the Major
maybe,

01:34:42.992 --> 01:34:46.620
he would not shoot at defenseless
women and children.

01:34:47.079 --> 01:34:48.956
- He could be right.

01:35:09.059 --> 01:35:10.477
What do you think?

01:35:10.561 --> 01:35:13.480
Would you shoot at
a bunch of women and kids?

01:35:16.192 --> 01:35:18.611
- Not the kids anyway.

01:35:19.153 --> 01:35:20.988
- Well, if you wouldn't do it,

01:35:21.071 --> 01:35:23.657
then the Major certainly
isn't gonna do it.

01:35:23.741 --> 01:35:26.327
- Now, what's on your mind?

01:35:26.702 --> 01:35:28.871
- You're the one that
does the thinking,

01:35:28.954 --> 01:35:32.458
and you came up with
a good idea this time, too.

01:35:35.419 --> 01:35:36.587
- Hmm.

01:35:42.134 --> 01:35:45.137
All right, but if the faith
trick don't work,

01:35:45.221 --> 01:35:46.972
this fella is gonna be
bright red.

01:36:00.694 --> 01:36:04.156
- They're coming!
They're coming!

01:36:24.802 --> 01:36:27.304
- He's playing his last card.

01:36:36.522 --> 01:36:38.232
Move in!

01:36:38.941 --> 01:36:40.484
Slowly!

01:36:54.581 --> 01:36:56.583
- Hah!
Hah!

01:36:57.084 --> 01:36:58.794
Yah!
Yah!

01:37:12.891 --> 01:37:16.312
- Well, aren't you going
to welcome me, old man?

01:37:18.689 --> 01:37:20.983
Your silence won't keep me
from destroying

01:37:21.066 --> 01:37:23.277
your dignified poverty.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.738
- Why waste time, Major?
- Quiet.

01:37:29.616 --> 01:37:31.869
There is work
to be done.

01:37:33.203 --> 01:37:34.538
Gentlemen,

01:37:34.872 --> 01:37:37.291
today will be a hard day for you,

01:37:37.374 --> 01:37:40.210
but you'll go home happy
to have earned your money

01:37:40.294 --> 01:37:42.880
honestly for once.

01:37:48.177 --> 01:37:51.805
Destroy everything they've built,
beginning with that house,

01:37:51.889 --> 01:37:54.600
but please without yelling and
making too much of an uproar.

01:37:54.683 --> 01:37:56.727
You know I detest noise.

01:37:57.019 --> 01:37:58.937
Burn their wagons
and the tents

01:37:59.021 --> 01:38:01.607
and scatter
those miserable cows.

01:38:01.690 --> 01:38:03.525
Then we'll depart and

01:38:04.943 --> 01:38:07.696
let Mr. Mezcal
take care of the rest.

01:38:09.490 --> 01:38:11.700
Lost your tongue, old man?

01:38:11.825 --> 01:38:14.078
- You've lost your battle, Major,

01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:16.330
from the very moment
you descended that hill.

01:38:19.375 --> 01:38:21.919
- The opinions of others,
no matter how idiotic,

01:38:22.002 --> 01:38:24.004
should be respected.

01:38:24.088 --> 01:38:25.923
I certainly will not be
the one to violate

01:38:26.006 --> 01:38:27.925
the rules of good manners.

01:38:28.008 --> 01:38:29.259
Jeff.

01:38:39.603 --> 01:38:41.980
Jeff, tear the house down.

01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:51.323
- All right, boys, start hacking.

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.388
Je-Jeff!
Jeff!

01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.890
- Yeah, Major?
- Come on back.

01:39:17.474 --> 01:39:19.435
- Hold it, boys!
- Yeah.

01:39:21.979 --> 01:39:23.605
- There's been
a variation in my plan.

01:39:23.939 --> 01:39:26.150
- Want us to start with
the wagons and tents?

01:39:27.276 --> 01:39:29.027
- No, I don't think so.

01:39:29.653 --> 01:39:31.029
- Start driving out the cows?

01:39:31.613 --> 01:39:33.323
- Why should those animals
bother you?

01:39:33.824 --> 01:39:36.660
- Well, I'm just not understanding.
What should I do?

01:39:37.911 --> 01:39:40.164
- Respect the principles
of these people.

01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:45.752
Put down your guns.
- What?

01:39:45.919 --> 01:39:48.172
- Uh, do what I say.

01:39:52.759 --> 01:39:54.011
- Si, hombre!

01:39:54.094 --> 01:39:57.181
This should make
brother Tobias very happy.

01:39:57.264 --> 01:39:58.974
He hates guns.

01:40:06.899 --> 01:40:08.233
- Excuse me, Major.

01:40:08.734 --> 01:40:11.278
I don't know what your reason is
for all this, but, uh,

01:40:11.361 --> 01:40:14.865
it better be good.
- A very good motive, my friend.

01:40:14.948 --> 01:40:15.991
- Hey, look ahead!

01:40:25.083 --> 01:40:27.544
- Your plan worked
like a miracle.

01:40:35.969 --> 01:40:37.721
- Well, Sheriff!

01:40:37.804 --> 01:40:41.183
This-this really is
very embarrassing.

01:40:41.266 --> 01:40:43.519
- Have you seen
what faith can do?

01:40:43.602 --> 01:40:47.189
- It'll work, if you put it
in a rifle barrel.

01:40:48.232 --> 01:40:50.317
Well, I guess that's it.

01:40:50.609 --> 01:40:53.779
- For the moment,
but this won't end here.

01:40:54.196 --> 01:40:55.489
- Oh,yeah?

01:40:55.697 --> 01:40:57.783
- No, Major, it ends here.

01:41:00.827 --> 01:41:03.121
It's gotta end here.

01:41:26.478 --> 01:41:29.356
- "The words of Choheleth,
son of David,

01:41:29.439 --> 01:41:32.609
"King of Jerusalem."
Your hat, please.

01:41:32.693 --> 01:41:35.737
"There's a time to be born
and a time to die."

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.365
- Yeah.
- "To love and to hate.

01:41:38.532 --> 01:41:40.242
"There is a time to-"

01:41:40.742 --> 01:41:42.828
brothers, it says here,

01:41:42.911 --> 01:41:45.080
"there's a time to fight
and a time to win!"

01:41:45.205 --> 01:41:46.790
Win, brothers!

01:41:52.838 --> 01:41:54.131
- Go and fight!
Go on!

01:42:44.348 --> 01:42:45.515
- A one.
- Two.

01:42:45.599 --> 01:42:47.976
- Three.
- And a four.

01:42:57.903 --> 01:42:58.945
- Wait!

01:43:06.161 --> 01:43:09.414
- Come on.
- Yeah, that's it.

01:43:35.023 --> 01:43:36.608
- You go up!

01:43:37.359 --> 01:43:38.568
Up!

01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:00.382
- Pardon me, brother.

01:44:23.572 --> 01:44:26.533
- No, brother, let him go.
What are you doing?

01:44:41.715 --> 01:44:44.342
- And a two, and three,
and a four.

01:45:09.451 --> 01:45:12.287
- I'm gonna bash ya
and bash ya.

01:45:24.633 --> 01:45:27.469
I'm gonna bash,
and I'm gonna bash ya.

01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:36.061
- Ready, get set, go.

01:45:49.991 --> 01:45:51.284
- Two.

01:46:16.142 --> 01:46:17.477
- No!

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.212
- Come on, brother!
Hit him hard!

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:05.525
- A one, and a two,
and a three, and a four.

01:47:05.692 --> 01:47:07.569
- I'm gonna bash ya,
and I'm gonna bash ya.

01:47:08.653 --> 01:47:11.364
- A one, a two,
and a three, and--

01:47:31.426 --> 01:47:33.720
- Here, brother.
Let-let me help you.

01:47:33.803 --> 01:47:36.389
Let me-
let me help you.

01:47:38.016 --> 01:47:40.060
- Thank you, brother.
- Thanks,heH.

01:47:40.143 --> 01:47:42.062
Load up the horses
and let's get outta here.

01:47:42.145 --> 01:47:43.772
- Okay.

01:47:48.902 --> 01:47:49.778
- All right,
the valley is yours,

01:47:49.861 --> 01:47:51.529
but give me back
my horses.

01:47:51.613 --> 01:47:54.532
- What horses?
- The ones you stole from me.

01:47:54.616 --> 01:47:56.201
- Hey, watch what
you're sayin', Major.

01:47:56.284 --> 01:47:58.620
- You're horse thieves,
and you know it.

01:47:59.955 --> 01:48:02.791
- One thing about that Major-—
he never lies.

01:48:03.083 --> 01:48:05.919
- Major, you ever been
to Nebraska?

01:48:09.255 --> 01:48:12.550
I heard there's some beautiful
pastures there.

01:48:18.098 --> 01:48:22.394
- That, uh, idea about Nebraska
doesn't sound too bad.

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:40.620
- Hey, Major, Nebraska
is that a-way.

01:48:52.799 --> 01:48:55.010
- Thank you, oh, Lo--
- Forget it.

01:48:55.093 --> 01:48:57.053
- I was rendering thanks
to the Lord, brother.

01:48:57.137 --> 01:48:59.222
- Oh.
- The insidious hand of Satan

01:48:59.305 --> 01:49:02.225
has left this land.
Accept our humble thanks,

01:49:02.308 --> 01:49:04.936
oh, Father.
- Hey, boss!

01:49:05.645 --> 01:49:07.397
What's this mean?

01:49:07.897 --> 01:49:09.649
Take a look.

01:49:13.611 --> 01:49:16.114
- What's that?
- It's our brand, brother.

01:49:18.283 --> 01:49:21.286
They're the tables
of the Holy Law.

01:49:28.168 --> 01:49:30.295
- Naturally, you don't
know nothin', huh?

01:49:32.297 --> 01:49:35.967
- Well, I thought, after all,
it's only right that these people

01:49:36.051 --> 01:49:37.802
get paid back
for damages, and so--

01:49:37.886 --> 01:49:39.512
- And so?

01:49:40.930 --> 01:49:42.932
I'm not mad at you.

01:49:43.224 --> 01:49:47.520
I'm mad at our ma.
She should've strangled you

01:49:47.604 --> 01:49:51.066
or at least drowned you
when you were born.

01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:54.402
Why, you no good crawlin'
son of a lowdown-

01:49:54.486 --> 01:49:56.362
- Don't be angry, Sheriff.

01:49:56.446 --> 01:49:59.282
It was the hand of destiny.
- Wait!

01:50:00.992 --> 01:50:03.161
Go to hell, you,
with your destiny,

01:50:03.244 --> 01:50:06.915
your sisters, your brothers,
your ancestors, your cows,

01:50:06.998 --> 01:50:09.709
and everything.

01:50:09.793 --> 01:50:11.169
- Oh.

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:19.427
- This is just my luck.
Hah!

01:50:40.657 --> 01:50:42.742
- Let us pray.
- Oh, yeah.

01:50:54.087 --> 01:50:57.882
- Oh, Lord, to your glory,
we raise our chalice of love.

01:50:58.508 --> 01:51:00.885
Take into your fold
this lost sheep,

01:51:01.386 --> 01:51:04.514
who in penitence, has thrown
his weapons of evil

01:51:04.597 --> 01:51:07.767
into the purifying flame
of your forgiveness.

01:51:08.143 --> 01:51:10.979
Circumcise the seeds of
wrongdoing, which have

01:51:11.104 --> 01:51:12.438
blemished his soul.

01:51:12.605 --> 01:51:14.774
Accept him back into
the light of your spirit.

01:51:16.025 --> 01:51:19.654
He shall labor 'til he grows
weary with fatigue.

01:51:19.737 --> 01:51:22.282
He shall irrigate
these vast fields,

01:51:22.448 --> 01:51:25.368
seed and pick
the fruits of his labor.

01:51:25.535 --> 01:51:27.579
He will cut woods,
build houses,

01:51:27.704 --> 01:51:29.289
and raise cattle.

01:51:29.372 --> 01:51:31.666
And when each hard
day's work is done,

01:51:32.458 --> 01:51:35.545
he shall return home
with joy for so much fatigue.

01:51:35.628 --> 01:51:37.630
Then, gathering his loved ones
around him,

01:51:38.089 --> 01:51:40.049
he will give thanks to you,
oh Lord,

01:51:40.425 --> 01:51:44.179
for guiding him through
the travails of his life on earth.

01:51:44.262 --> 01:51:47.473
We thank thee for the many blessings
you have bestowed upon us

01:51:47.557 --> 01:51:50.727
and hope always
to be worthy of your love.

01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:52.937
Amen.
- Amen.

01:51:55.148 --> 01:51:57.066
- Where is our new brother?

01:52:05.158 --> 01:52:06.409
- Come on, Bambino.

01:52:06.492 --> 01:52:09.078
Why don't you want me
to come with ya?

01:52:09.871 --> 01:52:12.498
- Get outta here, if you don't
wanna get plugged in the back

01:52:12.582 --> 01:52:15.210
while you sleep.
- But I'm your brother.

01:52:15.293 --> 01:52:17.045
- I'm beginning to doubt it.

01:52:17.128 --> 01:52:21.007
Look, I'm headin' west
for California,

01:52:21.841 --> 01:52:24.552
which means
you're going east!

01:52:25.762 --> 01:52:26.804
Huh!

01:52:57.877 --> 01:52:59.420
- Hah!

01:52:59.629 --> 01:53:01.005
Hah!

01:53:11.307 --> 01:53:13.726
You seen three varmints
around these parts?

01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:16.521
- With faces like hangmen,
you mean?

01:53:18.481 --> 01:53:21.359
- Are these the men?
- Yeah, that's them,

01:53:21.442 --> 01:53:23.945
and they robbed me. They
wanted to take my boots, too,

01:53:24.028 --> 01:53:25.780
but then they saw you
and took off.

01:53:25.863 --> 01:53:28.324
- Which way did they go?
- That a-way.

01:53:28.574 --> 01:53:29.993
- Hah!

01:53:30.868 --> 01:53:32.954
Yah! Yah!

01:53:51.139 --> 01:53:52.765
- Californ-i-a.
