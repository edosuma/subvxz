WEBVTT

01:59.779 --> 02:01.576
No, no!

02:03.516 --> 02:04.778
Stop, stop!

02:07.887 --> 02:09.912
Cut it out!

02:12.091 --> 02:13.786
Stop!

02:18.064 --> 02:19.998
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

02:20.199 --> 02:22.633
I just haven't seen you laugh
like this in a long time.

02:23.102 --> 02:25.832
That's... it's nice.
I miss it.

02:27.573 --> 02:29.564
I miss it, too.

02:30.343 --> 02:33.141
We're gonna work
this out, right?

02:42.021 --> 02:45.513
Trevor, I hope it's everything
you want it to be.

02:45.992 --> 02:49.120
It will be. It will be.

02:53.332 --> 02:54.799
Oh, shit!

03:17.824 --> 03:19.519
Calm down.

03:23.196 --> 03:25.892
Trevor! Trevor!

04:07.808 --> 04:09.867
Help me! Somebody!

04:32.633 --> 04:36.125
No! No!

04:42.509 --> 04:45.376
No! No!

04:52.653 --> 04:55.281
It's nice to see you again.

05:08.101 --> 05:11.434
It's okay, Trevor.
You're safe now.

05:12.839 --> 05:14.830
Where's Kirsty?

05:16.243 --> 05:18.609
Where's my wife?

05:24.384 --> 05:26.909
This should help you relax.

05:37.230 --> 05:39.755
Just relax, okay?

05:44.805 --> 05:46.739
Trevor?

05:48.375 --> 05:49.774
Trevor!

05:50.978 --> 05:53.344
Trevor. Wake up, Trevor.

06:25.812 --> 06:29.304
- It's imperative that you stay calm.
- As you can see...

06:29.516 --> 06:32.576
the thinnest layer of cortex
separates the part of the brain...

06:32.786 --> 06:36.916
that feels pleasure from the part
of the brain that feels pain.

06:37.124 --> 06:40.059
Over the course
of this procedure...

06:40.260 --> 06:44.026
I will be triggering memories,
disrupting the unconscious.

06:44.231 --> 06:48.725
So our patient may
experience some distress.

06:48.935 --> 06:52.666
- What are you people doing to me?
- Now just relax, Trevor.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.731
We're helping you.

06:57.711 --> 07:00.805
Helping you remember.

07:14.394 --> 07:15.759
Welcome back.

07:16.196 --> 07:20.030
How are those headaches?
Any change in the intensity?

07:20.233 --> 07:22.998
Oh, man, what happened?

07:30.011 --> 07:34.004
- My name is Allison.
- You a dream too, Allison?

07:36.851 --> 07:41.151
- Still hallucinating, huh?
- No, I was there before.

07:41.823 --> 07:45.122
It looked like a dream,
but it just felt so...

07:46.694 --> 07:48.161
Real?

07:48.796 --> 07:50.593
Yeah.

07:53.034 --> 07:54.831
It's probably
the morphine, Trevor.

07:55.036 --> 07:59.564
We're going to run tests to pinpoint
what's causing your headaches.

08:00.641 --> 08:03.405
With the kind of head trauma
you suffered...

08:03.611 --> 08:06.478
you're lucky to be here at all.

08:11.352 --> 08:16.016
- I wanna see you through this.
- I'm gonna take your word on it.

08:17.158 --> 08:20.059
Hello, Trevor,
back again, huh?

08:21.462 --> 08:25.592
- What seems to be the trouble?
- He's complaining of headaches...

08:25.800 --> 08:29.361
blackouts, hallucinations,
acute memory loss.

08:29.570 --> 08:34.269
- I recommend that we admit him.
- I don't see any abnormalities.

08:34.475 --> 08:38.035
Time to ween you off those painkillers.
Wouldn't want you getting hooked.

08:38.246 --> 08:42.740
Start coming to the hospital for
getting a fix. We can't have that.

08:42.950 --> 08:46.511
I'm going to release you. Save
this bed for someone who needs it.

08:47.655 --> 08:51.421
Hey, Doc, where's Kirsty?
Where's my wife?

08:51.626 --> 08:53.821
That's what I'd like to know.

08:57.498 --> 08:59.125
I knocked.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.062
What do you mean she's missing?

09:01.269 --> 09:04.670
Oh, it's not like we're going
to stop looking, Mr. Gooden.

09:04.872 --> 09:07.898
- I don't give up that easy.
- Well...

09:08.109 --> 09:10.703
what if I took you back there,
you know, and walked you through it?

09:11.345 --> 09:14.280
We've done that already.
Over a month ago.

09:14.482 --> 09:16.473
What?

09:16.684 --> 09:19.847
You sure you're okay to drive?

09:20.888 --> 09:24.585
Look, obviously I caught you
at a bad time. Go home...

09:24.792 --> 09:28.990
get some rest.
You look like hell warmed over.

09:30.398 --> 09:32.127
Thanks.

09:34.168 --> 09:37.001
Oh, one more thing.

09:37.205 --> 09:40.299
You said you tried to pull her
out of the passenger side...

09:40.508 --> 09:44.103
but the door was locked, right?
Well, that's strange.

09:45.913 --> 09:49.144
Because report says...

09:49.951 --> 09:55.048
the doors were open when
the car was pulled from the river.

09:56.023 --> 10:00.426
I... Maybe she unlocked them,
you know, swam out.

10:01.395 --> 10:05.491
Maybe. I'll double check,
could be their bad.

10:06.567 --> 10:10.094
Anyway, gotta run.

10:10.304 --> 10:12.431
We'll talk soon.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.770
You sure I can't
give you a lift?

10:17.078 --> 10:19.546
Suit yourself.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.900
Do you mind turning that down?

10:54.048 --> 10:55.811
Right, ah...

10:56.651 --> 11:00.019
the music,
just mind turning that down?

12:44.726 --> 12:46.557
Why don't you come to bed?

12:54.469 --> 12:56.061
Hey, turn off the light.

13:03.378 --> 13:06.438
- I love you.
- I love you too.

13:48.557 --> 13:52.220
Well, well, well, look who
decided to show up today.

13:54.062 --> 13:57.088
Bankers hours.
Must be nice, huh?

13:57.299 --> 14:00.200
Hey, what happened
to you yesterday?

14:00.936 --> 14:04.133
Boss came by looking for you after
you left. She didn't look happy.

14:04.339 --> 14:06.307
Hey, I got a...

14:08.543 --> 14:11.376
You got a piece of ass,
didn't you?

14:11.580 --> 14:15.778
That's why you didn't come back
from lunch. We'll call it a...

14:16.184 --> 14:18.778
personal day, okay?

14:21.957 --> 14:25.256
Right, look, forget
I said anything, okay? Just...

14:25.460 --> 14:29.055
get some numbers going,
any numbers at all will do.

14:29.264 --> 14:31.664
Hills have eyes, remember?

14:36.739 --> 14:39.401
We're all here for you, Trev.

16:16.739 --> 16:19.503
I can see into your soul.

16:19.909 --> 16:21.672
Hey!

16:22.511 --> 16:25.674
65% of all headaches are due
to low blood sugar levels, Trev.

16:26.515 --> 16:27.504
Yeah.

16:28.184 --> 16:30.345
Grab yourself a cookie.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.432
Come on!

16:54.243 --> 16:55.301
Now what?

16:59.081 --> 17:01.549
See anything you like?

17:02.318 --> 17:04.286
Well, do you?

17:04.654 --> 17:07.452
Come on, speak up.
I'm trying to run a business here.

17:07.656 --> 17:10.955
Right, I'm sorry. I was just
kind of spaced for a second.

17:11.627 --> 17:14.858
- Well, don't let it happen again.
- Right.

17:17.366 --> 17:19.993
- I may have to get rough with you.
- What?

17:22.104 --> 17:25.631
I know what you like.
Come on, Trevor.

17:25.840 --> 17:29.470
- It's me, Gwen.
- It's just moving a little too fast.

17:30.079 --> 17:34.175
Don't tell me Mr. Mario Andretti
is giving me a speeding ticket.

17:34.383 --> 17:38.376
Hey, wait, my wife just died,
you know. We can...

17:38.587 --> 17:39.576
I know.

17:43.092 --> 17:45.253
It's perfect.

18:00.209 --> 18:03.269
Oh, yeah.
That's it, Trevor.

18:08.818 --> 18:12.448
- What the hell are we doing?
- Nothing we haven't done before.

18:14.558 --> 18:17.083
We'll pick this up later.

18:22.966 --> 18:26.231
Now get some fucking
work done.

18:31.108 --> 18:32.905
We're watching you.

18:48.525 --> 18:50.584
Oh, my God.

18:58.635 --> 19:01.365
Oh, yeah.
That's it, Trevor.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.971
Oh, yeah.
That's it, Trevor.

19:08.078 --> 19:12.481
- Oh, yeah. That's it, Trevor.
- What the fuck?

19:35.839 --> 19:37.363
Hello?

19:37.574 --> 19:41.101
Trevor, this is Detective Lange.
It's about your wife.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.905
Trevor, are you there?

19:46.116 --> 19:48.812
Hello? Trevor?

19:49.019 --> 19:51.988
Thank you for
coming down, Trevor.

19:52.756 --> 19:56.556
- How's that head of yours feeling?
- It's a lot better, thanks.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.921
We still haven't been able
to locate your wife.

19:59.129 --> 20:02.826
Although Missing Persons turned up
some evidences that suggest...

20:03.033 --> 20:07.402
...foul play may have been involved.
- Foul play, what?

20:07.604 --> 20:11.062
For one thing. There were
no skid marks on the bridge.

20:11.274 --> 20:14.243
The tires were all intact,
and from what we can tell...

20:14.644 --> 20:19.672
there's nothing wrong. The car was
driven off the bridge intentionally.

20:20.050 --> 20:23.747
I just, I just lost control.
And I swerved.

20:24.688 --> 20:26.952
We went off the bridge. I tried
to get her out, but I couldn't...

20:27.157 --> 20:29.489
Is there anything that
might have happened...

20:29.693 --> 20:32.685
just before that accident
that you haven't mentioned?

20:32.896 --> 20:37.094
Look, I've told you everything
I could remember. I'm sorry...

20:37.300 --> 20:42.135
Don't take it the wrong way. I'm
just a guy trying to do a job here.

20:42.339 --> 20:44.933
I mean,
between your head injury and...

20:45.141 --> 20:48.941
and the fact that you're still on
some strong pain medication...

20:49.145 --> 20:52.478
you may have forgot something
that could help us and...

20:52.682 --> 20:57.210
everything you have told us could
just be the medication talking.

20:57.420 --> 21:01.618
So, we'll be revisiting
things a lot around here.

21:02.626 --> 21:04.093
No, no, no!

21:19.409 --> 21:22.037
Trevor, you still in there?

21:22.546 --> 21:25.811
- She was trapped inside.
- Well, apparently, she got out.

21:26.016 --> 21:28.143
And therein lies a problem.

21:29.152 --> 21:33.384
I won't keep you.
If we have any more questions...

21:33.590 --> 21:37.117
you'll get a call from myself
or my partner, Detective Givens.

21:37.794 --> 21:39.728
You guys know something that I don't?

21:39.930 --> 21:44.458
All things considered, we probably
know a lot less than you do.

21:44.668 --> 21:47.103
Have a good afternoon, Trevor.

21:53.377 --> 21:54.867
Yeah.

22:31.315 --> 22:33.146
What's the matter, boy?

23:10.054 --> 23:11.646
Shit!

23:54.699 --> 23:55.688
What's happening?

24:59.764 --> 25:01.755
I did it.

25:04.435 --> 25:07.165
Well, what do you think?

25:07.371 --> 25:11.307
I was going to get it on my ass,
but I thought this was sexier.

25:14.912 --> 25:18.439
- Yeah, that's...
- I knew you'd like it.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.088
You know, I'm sorry, I...

25:24.723 --> 25:26.281
I'm having a weird day.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.525
- Really weird.
- Okay.

25:31.930 --> 25:36.264
It's definitely missing a woman's
touch that it used to have.

25:36.468 --> 25:39.062
Yeah. Well...

25:40.071 --> 25:43.905
Well, if you feel like...

25:44.109 --> 25:48.978
talking or whatever,
you know where I am.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.762
- Are you okay?
- Not at all.

26:13.205 --> 26:16.368
Strange, strange, strange.

27:05.657 --> 27:09.616
- How do you feel?
- What are you talking about?

27:09.928 --> 27:13.796
It's our anniversary, Trevor,
it's been five years.

27:13.999 --> 27:17.093
- How do you feel?
- I feel great. Why wouldn't I?

27:18.236 --> 27:23.367
I've got something planned for you.
I've been planning it a long time.

27:23.575 --> 27:28.171
Planning what? Why don't you
just come to bed, Trev? Please?

27:28.380 --> 27:32.714
First things first.
I have a little gift for you.

27:33.885 --> 27:37.616
Something to remind you
just how much you mean to me.

27:37.889 --> 27:42.155
I can't believe you got me
a present. It's beautiful!

27:45.430 --> 27:49.799
- Where did you get this?
- See if you can open it, Kirsty.

27:57.742 --> 28:01.576
I can't believe you got me a
present. You wrapped this yourself?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.318
Hello?

28:25.070 --> 28:26.970
Hello?

29:00.773 --> 29:05.267
- Miss me?
- You scared the shit out of me.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.178
What's this?

29:11.283 --> 29:14.252
This innocent bit is
getting a little old.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.584
Don't you think?

29:20.760 --> 29:22.250
Sit.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.400
Don't make me beat you.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.193
Where is it?

29:32.705 --> 29:34.730
Where's what?

29:37.643 --> 29:40.111
You'd usually have it up
and running by now.

29:52.792 --> 29:55.727
Oh, yeah.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.594
You're a bad boy, huh?

29:58.798 --> 30:01.665
Yeah, that's the Trevor I know.

30:05.204 --> 30:08.799
Get off me.
Come on, get up, get up.

30:12.878 --> 30:16.109
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

30:21.087 --> 30:24.079
You have definitely
got a screw loose.

30:27.793 --> 30:31.194
You can say good-bye
to that promotion.

30:35.734 --> 30:39.170
That's it, Trevor.
That's a good boy.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.965
Oh, that's a good boy.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.872
I know what you like.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.171
Oh, Trevor!

30:48.614 --> 30:52.345
Oh, yeah. That's it.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.586
Yeah!

31:04.530 --> 31:06.930
Come on, Trevor.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.601
We're all here for you, Trevor.

31:18.177 --> 31:21.169
Hey, little boy,
do you like what you see?

31:25.284 --> 31:26.842
That's it, Trevor.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.485
That's perfect, Trevor. Yeah.

31:33.826 --> 31:38.388
- Gwen! No!
- Trevor! Trevor!

31:39.632 --> 31:41.691
Help! Help!

31:42.401 --> 31:44.301
Gwen! Gwen.

31:46.939 --> 31:49.339
Help me! Help me!

31:51.210 --> 31:53.235
No! No!

31:55.114 --> 31:57.480
Must be nice.

32:00.019 --> 32:03.420
- What?
- Getting paid for doing shit.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.815
You don't understand.

32:08.027 --> 32:12.760
I've got some seriously
weird shit going on.

32:14.133 --> 32:17.261
The accident fucked you
more than I thought.

32:18.337 --> 32:21.704
Hey, you know what?

32:22.841 --> 32:24.968
I'm gonna hook you up, man.

32:25.177 --> 32:29.011
She'll take one look at you
and know exactly...

32:30.649 --> 32:32.675
what you need.

32:36.590 --> 32:39.650
And look busy, all right?

32:41.094 --> 32:43.494
Anybody seen Gwen?

33:16.529 --> 33:18.997
Just relax.

33:19.299 --> 33:22.666
Let the needles
connect to your soul.

33:22.869 --> 33:24.860
These headaches
you've been getting.

33:25.472 --> 33:28.168
Do they happen in conjunction
with the hallucinations?

33:29.943 --> 33:34.380
Sort of. My head's been in constant
pain ever since the accident.

33:34.581 --> 33:37.516
And it seems to increase whenever
I get those, you know...

33:38.385 --> 33:41.946
- Dreams?
- No, more like nightmares, really.

33:43.623 --> 33:48.492
- It just seems so real.
- That's your subconscious talking.

33:48.695 --> 33:52.290
It's trying to tell you something
about your waking life.

33:55.201 --> 33:58.659
So, what's the mirror for?

34:01.641 --> 34:05.270
To help you look into your soul.

34:06.546 --> 34:09.242
I can see into your soul.

34:12.886 --> 34:15.353
You feel desperate.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.013
Trapped by a wife who
suffocates you with forgiveness.

34:19.626 --> 34:22.424
You're looking for a way out.

34:22.629 --> 34:26.156
- Yeah.
- Something final.

34:26.498 --> 34:30.764
Without remorse.
Without regret.

34:31.538 --> 34:36.407
Wherever there is hate,
violence, depravity...

34:36.609 --> 34:38.940
a door will always be found.

34:41.848 --> 34:44.315
This musical puzzle...

34:45.452 --> 34:49.786
created by a Frenchman,
named Lemarchand.

35:00.233 --> 35:04.294
It is a means to break
the surface of the real.

36:21.115 --> 36:24.050
Which do you find
more exhilarating, Trevor?

36:24.452 --> 36:26.784
The pain or the pleasure?

36:27.955 --> 36:30.856
Personally I prefer pain.

36:36.564 --> 36:39.226
Is there something wrong?

36:43.637 --> 36:45.332
No.

36:46.774 --> 36:49.208
No, I'm okay.

36:52.780 --> 36:55.442
Should I get that for you?

37:06.660 --> 37:11.063
- Hello?
- Detective Givens, Lange's partner.

37:11.866 --> 37:16.269
I don't understand. How can this be
a homicide when there's no murder?

37:16.470 --> 37:19.564
The last time anybody saw her,
she was alive. You think she's dead.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.903
Hey, Detective.

37:22.109 --> 37:25.408
I saw my wife drown in our car.

37:25.613 --> 37:28.446
Yeah. Right.

37:29.683 --> 37:34.086
I've done my homework on you. You
are smart with numbers, aren't you?

37:34.455 --> 37:37.288
- Where are you going with this?
- How many zeros...

37:37.491 --> 37:40.187
was your wife's worth?

37:40.394 --> 37:44.262
- We had nothing.
- No, you had nothing.

37:44.465 --> 37:48.162
She had a nice little inheritance
stashed away for a rainy day.

37:50.070 --> 37:52.300
I'm sorry, what?

37:55.142 --> 37:59.408
Don't play fucking stupid with me.
Kirsty's father and Uncle Frank...

37:59.747 --> 38:04.411
had several sizable financial
holdings when they passed away...

38:04.618 --> 38:09.385
under some rather
unusual circumstances.

38:09.590 --> 38:13.890
You know, I don't know. Kirsty
never liked to talk about her past.

38:14.094 --> 38:17.222
Well, maybe that's because
she didn't really trust you.

38:17.431 --> 38:21.060
It seems that she's the sole
beneficiary, so if Kirsty's dead...

38:21.268 --> 38:23.998
like you seem so fucking certain...

38:24.204 --> 38:28.573
well, then I guess it all...
it all goes to you, Trev.

38:28.776 --> 38:32.177
I swear to God, man.
I don't know anything about that.

38:37.151 --> 38:38.982
My partner...

38:39.186 --> 38:42.781
Detective Lange, he's softer
around the heart than I am. Me...

38:43.857 --> 38:48.123
I'm hard. When I get a feeling
about something, I'm usually right.

38:48.796 --> 38:52.163
I get a bad feeling
about you, Trev.

38:54.702 --> 38:56.602
Real bad.

38:58.238 --> 39:01.332
You're obsessed with that thing.
God forbid you let one event go...

39:01.542 --> 39:05.000
unrecorded.
Come to bed. Please?

39:05.479 --> 39:09.279
Please. It's our anniversary,
Trevor, come on.

39:09.483 --> 39:11.144
First things first.

39:19.860 --> 39:23.227
Just like I thought.
Nothing.

39:40.180 --> 39:41.977
Hey.

39:42.183 --> 39:44.151
- Hey.
- Can I...

39:44.486 --> 39:47.216
borrow something?

39:51.793 --> 39:53.590
- Yeah, sure. What do you want?
- You.

39:57.198 --> 40:00.167
You know, I'm feeling kind
of weird here, you know?

40:03.405 --> 40:05.202
God!

40:08.243 --> 40:11.076
It's getting hot in here,
you know?

40:14.649 --> 40:17.777
You are being kind of... weird.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.179
It's almost like...

40:23.525 --> 40:25.959
Almost somebody else.

40:34.302 --> 40:36.099
Tie me up.

40:39.474 --> 40:41.442
Come here.

40:41.910 --> 40:43.707
Come on.

40:45.647 --> 40:47.945
That's it.

42:20.842 --> 42:23.208
All problems solved.

43:42.791 --> 43:44.918
Oh, man, you're...

43:45.127 --> 43:49.393
I have some serious space issues.
What did you want?

43:50.232 --> 43:51.790
Right.

43:52.635 --> 43:56.332
We need to talk, you know,
about what we did last night.

43:57.573 --> 44:01.236
- What?
- Who the fuck is it?

44:01.744 --> 44:06.579
- Who's in there with you?
- Are you having a nervous breakdown?

44:07.616 --> 44:10.483
Hey. What can we do
for you, chief?

44:12.354 --> 44:14.345
Who are you?

44:14.556 --> 44:18.492
If you know Tawny,
you better know me, pal.

44:19.128 --> 44:22.928
I'm sorry. It's my mistake.
Talk to you later.

44:27.970 --> 44:30.200
Let's make it much later.

44:35.344 --> 44:36.675
Get in.

44:38.380 --> 44:42.282
Hey, we're not in right now. Leave
a message after the beep. Thanks.

44:42.484 --> 44:46.386
This is Detective Lange.
We need to talk as soon as possible.

44:46.588 --> 44:49.853
There's been an interesting
twist in the puzzle.

44:54.029 --> 44:57.362
I'm telling you right now.
Sure as I am standing here.

44:58.534 --> 45:02.300
- No. I'm not concealing. Why?
- It's done.

45:05.441 --> 45:07.841
What are you doing
to find my wife?

45:08.043 --> 45:12.810
Well, I can assure you we're doing
everything in our power to find her.

45:13.015 --> 45:16.644
This investigation is gonna take
some time. I need your cooperation.

45:16.852 --> 45:19.582
What about that message
you left on my answering machine?

45:19.788 --> 45:23.656
What's your relationship
with Gwen Stevens?

45:23.993 --> 45:25.654
What?

45:29.732 --> 45:32.701
Yeah, thanks.
So that's all for me?

45:41.777 --> 45:44.405
- She was my boss.
- And that's it?

45:44.613 --> 45:46.274
Yeah, that's it.

45:46.482 --> 45:49.508
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

45:50.285 --> 45:53.743
We leave no stone unturned
around here, Trevor.

45:54.156 --> 45:57.592
- You think I did it.
- Hey, I'm on your side here.

45:58.694 --> 46:01.561
Would you please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

46:01.997 --> 46:04.329
I wish I knew.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.927
Yeah, I bet.

46:40.269 --> 46:45.104
Once you choose to open the box
and unleash its power...

46:45.307 --> 46:49.607
there is no returning. Now,
are you willing to pay the price?

46:55.285 --> 46:59.517
No, the price is far greater.
But you'll learn that.

47:03.059 --> 47:04.822
They all do.

47:10.633 --> 47:11.827
Hey.

47:13.002 --> 47:16.631
- You okay?
- Yeah. I was just, you know...

47:17.240 --> 47:19.174
Can I get you anything?

47:19.642 --> 47:22.839
No, no. I'm okay.

48:05.152 --> 48:06.847
You okay?

48:07.054 --> 48:11.218
I don't know, Allison, I think
I really screwed everything up.

48:11.425 --> 48:14.417
Come on, Trevor,
you can't blame yourself.

48:19.767 --> 48:20.825
I miss her.

48:25.072 --> 48:27.870
I miss my wife.

48:33.180 --> 48:35.842
Sounds like you're remembering
more and more.

48:36.050 --> 48:38.382
That's a good thing, Trevor.

48:39.153 --> 48:42.088
Maybe you're not the angel
that you thought you were.

48:43.791 --> 48:46.589
Come on, you're going to
get through this, Trevor.

48:54.702 --> 48:57.466
Hey, Bret. Come here.

48:57.672 --> 49:00.004
- We need to talk.
- Look, I'm really, really busy.

49:00.207 --> 49:04.507
I've got a stack of reports due
by 3. The suits are all over my ass.

49:04.712 --> 49:07.044
- What did you tell the police?
- Nothing they didn't already know.

49:07.248 --> 49:10.081
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I didn't tell them anything new.

49:10.284 --> 49:13.811
Hey, Bret, why don't you help me
out here, man? I think I did it.

49:14.021 --> 49:16.182
- Did what?
- Killed Kirsty.

49:17.558 --> 49:19.890
I've got a report to do.

49:23.798 --> 49:27.325
- Let's make yourself at home.
- Oh, I already have.

49:27.535 --> 49:32.438
Oh, yes.
Why are you here, Detective?

49:33.307 --> 49:38.472
We found this curious object not too
far from the site of the accident.

49:39.613 --> 49:45.108
No prints. Forensics scraped a little
dark residue that was caked on it.

49:45.920 --> 49:48.650
Wanna take a guess
what they found?

49:48.856 --> 49:51.791
Ah, no, but something tells me
that you're gonna tell me.

49:52.226 --> 49:54.126
Blood, Trevor.

49:54.328 --> 49:58.594
Match the one we took from your car.
Can you tell me anything about it?

49:58.799 --> 50:00.596
I... it...

50:00.801 --> 50:05.500
It looks familiar. Like most
things. I think it was in the car.

50:05.706 --> 50:08.698
Gee, you think so?

50:09.910 --> 50:14.711
Think about it, Trevor.
Give me something to go on here.

50:14.915 --> 50:19.375
I've got Givens ready to drag you in
today on murder charges.

50:19.587 --> 50:22.920
Help me get him off my back.
Off your back.

50:24.091 --> 50:27.117
It was an accident, Detective.
Just like I've been saying all along.

50:27.328 --> 50:29.729
Somebody's got to believe me.

50:29.931 --> 50:33.059
- I believe you, Trevor.
- Damn.

50:33.268 --> 50:37.329
But so far,
I'm the only one who does.

50:57.559 --> 50:59.026
Hey.

50:59.461 --> 51:02.862
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
We need to talk.

51:08.069 --> 51:12.028
- What's up?
- It's getting weird around here.

51:12.240 --> 51:14.731
I quit, today's my last day.
I figured it was the perfect time...

51:14.943 --> 51:17.411
to say "fuck you" to the morons
around here, make a serious change.

51:17.612 --> 51:19.443
Oh, well, Bret, that's...

51:30.091 --> 51:34.187
Look, I know you got your golden
egg all lined up and that's cool.

51:34.396 --> 51:36.762
But the rest of us got to make some
hay for ourselves, 'cause frankly...

51:36.965 --> 51:38.694
this job ain't paying
the bills anymore.

51:38.900 --> 51:41.198
We're not drinking from the
cash cow like your wife was.

51:43.505 --> 51:45.439
What are you talking about?

51:45.640 --> 51:47.665
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah.

51:47.876 --> 51:49.468
The money.

51:49.811 --> 51:52.712
Don't play stupid. Her inheritance.
I'm talking about the plan.

51:54.416 --> 51:57.351
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait. Bret.

51:58.286 --> 52:00.516
- What did you tell Lange?
- Come on, Trev, what the hell's...

52:00.722 --> 52:05.159
No, no, no! Did you tell him about
Gwen? About the inheritance?

52:05.627 --> 52:07.993
I didn't tell them anything.

52:09.231 --> 52:11.324
We're all here for you, Trev.

52:21.209 --> 52:24.406
I trusted you, goddamn it!
How could you do this to us?

52:25.347 --> 52:27.042
God!

52:27.816 --> 52:29.443
Shit.

52:30.619 --> 52:32.814
Jesus, buddy, are you all right?

52:33.688 --> 52:36.851
- Shit, I got to go, man.
- Well, let me give you...

52:38.126 --> 52:39.787
a ride.

52:53.375 --> 52:57.744
Yeah, hello. Hi. I'd like to speak
to Doctor Allison Dormere.

53:00.448 --> 53:04.441
Hello. Yeah, hi. What do you mean
she's not there?

53:05.987 --> 53:10.822
She's always there.
She's a resident. All right.

53:11.026 --> 53:15.656
Can you please help me find her?
Please. Hello?

53:17.232 --> 53:18.756
Damn it.

53:28.310 --> 53:31.973
There's no physical explanation for
these headaches of yours, Trevor.

53:32.180 --> 53:34.648
Your body's completely healed.

53:35.250 --> 53:37.912
If there's any pain
in your head...

53:39.254 --> 53:41.916
it's in your head.

53:42.757 --> 53:47.421
Your soul is locked up inside you.

53:47.629 --> 53:50.826
And you need to free it, Trevor.

53:51.032 --> 53:55.025
You blocked yourself from the
healing process. We need to do that.

53:55.236 --> 53:57.704
Heal your soul.

53:58.807 --> 54:01.833
The only way to do that
is to give in utterly.

54:02.310 --> 54:05.075
Do you know what I mean
by giving in?

54:05.281 --> 54:06.908
No.

54:07.850 --> 54:10.114
It's about trust.

54:10.319 --> 54:13.880
Do you trust me implicitly?

54:14.090 --> 54:16.251
I don't know what's real...

54:16.459 --> 54:20.862
and what isn't real anymore.
How can I trust anybody?

54:31.073 --> 54:33.098
You can trust me.

54:38.848 --> 54:42.477
Surrender yourself to your past.

54:43.419 --> 54:45.979
It's the only way you can
become whole again.

54:52.294 --> 54:56.128
Are you willing to partake?

55:39.608 --> 55:42.236
Can you hear me?
Just nod.

55:42.845 --> 55:44.836
You know where you are?

55:45.481 --> 55:46.470
Ambulance.

55:46.682 --> 55:50.709
- You remember what happened?
- Some woman on top of me...

55:50.953 --> 55:55.447
...naked, trying to kill me.
- Ah, yeah, not quite that good.

55:55.658 --> 55:59.822
You were riding on a bus, and then
you just collapsed on the floor.

56:00.029 --> 56:02.327
- You remember riding on a bus now?
- No.

56:05.034 --> 56:06.763
Maybe.

56:17.246 --> 56:20.511
Hello, Trevor. Well,
what did you do this time?

56:20.716 --> 56:23.241
Oh, yeah, a couple of stitches
will fix that right up.

56:23.652 --> 56:25.711
Hey, where's Allison?

56:25.921 --> 56:28.788
Yeah, Allison Dormere.
She's a resident here.

56:29.992 --> 56:34.895
We don't have any resident called
Allison. My nurse will numb this up.

56:35.097 --> 56:37.691
I'll get right back to you.

56:39.301 --> 56:42.236
It's imperative that you stay calm.

56:42.872 --> 56:44.772
This might sting a little.

56:45.841 --> 56:49.277
- Just relax. Remember, we're all...
- Here for you. Go ahead, say it.

56:49.478 --> 56:53.505
I'm tired of this shit.
Tired of all you people.

57:10.900 --> 57:15.360
Okay, you caught me. At least
let me finish. I got one puff left.

57:16.172 --> 57:18.037
Knock yourself out.

57:21.277 --> 57:24.041
Trevor, I heard you were looking
for me. Is everything all right?

57:24.246 --> 57:26.237
Allison, hey.

57:27.616 --> 57:30.676
No. I'm not all right.

57:31.654 --> 57:35.590
Look, I think I've done some very...

57:35.791 --> 57:38.385
very bad things.

57:39.963 --> 57:43.091
Everybody does things
they regret.

57:43.633 --> 57:45.794
It's part of life.

57:46.002 --> 57:48.937
Until now you couldn't remember
parts of your past, and...

57:49.339 --> 57:52.433
now they're hitting you all at once.
It's a shock to the system.

57:52.843 --> 57:58.076
You can't undo your past.
You're going to have to confront it.

57:59.049 --> 58:02.849
And it frightens me to think that I
can't be there for you when you do.

58:09.993 --> 58:14.054
- Hey, buddy?
- I was thinking I was going insane.

58:14.264 --> 58:15.925
- Hey, buddy.
- What?

58:16.867 --> 58:19.301
Who the hell are you talking to?

58:40.056 --> 58:44.425
- What have you done?
- What's your relationship with Gwen?

58:44.628 --> 58:47.620
I know about Gwen
and the others.

58:52.269 --> 58:53.964
What the fuck...?

59:40.016 --> 59:42.143
Where are you?

59:42.352 --> 59:45.253
What have you
done to me? Fuck.

59:45.922 --> 59:48.652
What the fuck is
happening to me?

59:53.530 --> 59:56.328
Where are you, goddamn it?

59:56.533 --> 59:58.865
Poor Trevor.

01:00:01.972 --> 01:00:03.872
Who are you?

01:00:08.611 --> 01:00:11.205
Still in the dark?

01:00:16.953 --> 01:00:22.220
- This game is over. Do you hear me?
- Oh, I hear everything.

01:00:22.425 --> 01:00:25.019
And soon you will
know everything.

01:00:25.228 --> 01:00:28.561
Much more than you want.
I guarantee it.

01:00:29.632 --> 01:00:33.033
What is this?
Why are you doing this to me?

01:00:33.236 --> 01:00:36.865
Is it so difficult
to face your demons?

01:00:38.108 --> 01:00:41.771
No. None of this is real.

01:00:42.879 --> 01:00:46.406
- You're not real.
- Oh, but I'm afraid I am.

01:00:48.785 --> 01:00:51.447
You can't run from your past.

01:00:56.626 --> 01:00:58.526
You killed them.

01:00:59.195 --> 01:01:01.459
You killed Kirsty.

01:01:01.664 --> 01:01:03.757
You killed Gwen...

01:01:03.967 --> 01:01:06.299
and the others.

01:01:06.503 --> 01:01:08.733
You killed them...

01:01:08.938 --> 01:01:11.065
and now you're trying
to pin it on me.

01:01:11.674 --> 01:01:16.078
The killer is amongst us, yes.

01:01:26.524 --> 01:01:27.991
Fuck!

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:41.834
God damn it!

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:10.499
Where have you been, Trev?
I've been looking all over for you.

01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:21.210
Jesus, what are you doing?
Put that thing away.

01:02:22.012 --> 01:02:24.913
Tonight was supposed to be
the night, Trev, remember?

01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:28.449
Right, you don't remember anything.
Let me remind you about your plan.

01:02:28.652 --> 01:02:31.450
We kill Kirsty, make it look like
a suicide, you get all her money...

01:02:31.655 --> 01:02:34.021
we split it 50/50.

01:02:34.225 --> 01:02:35.852
But none of that's gonna
happen now, is it?

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:39.457
You had to go solo with your car
accident bit. You fucked it all up.

01:02:39.663 --> 01:02:44.032
What were you thinking, Trev?
That I'd forget about our deal?

01:02:44.235 --> 01:02:46.795
- I don't know...
- What you're talking about. I know.

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:51.097
Got to tell you, the amnesia routine
is starting to get a little old.

01:02:51.308 --> 01:02:55.540
Lange's on to you. It's a matter
of time before he's on to me.

01:02:57.414 --> 01:03:00.383
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life in prison.

01:03:01.519 --> 01:03:03.384
I'd rather spend it in hell.

01:03:04.755 --> 01:03:06.416
With you.

01:03:15.399 --> 01:03:17.333
Bret, what did you do?

01:03:30.848 --> 01:03:34.784
No, you're not real.
Get out of my head!

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.856
Sage.

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:53.894
Sage.

01:05:23.528 --> 01:05:24.995
Trevor.

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:29.297
- You don't understand. I didn't...
- Save it.

01:05:30.835 --> 01:05:33.303
You don't need to say a thing.

01:05:34.205 --> 01:05:36.070
No, I say... You don't...

01:05:36.341 --> 01:05:38.332
You have the right
to remain in silence.

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:49.584
What's going on here, Detective?
You can't believe that I did this.

01:05:49.788 --> 01:05:52.723
Detective, believe me, I didn't do
what you think I did, please.

01:05:52.924 --> 01:05:56.690
Relax, Trevor. Let's get to the
bottom of this once and for all.

01:05:56.895 --> 01:05:59.693
You want to tell me exactly
what happened back there...

01:05:59.964 --> 01:06:02.899
or should we just play
the head game a little longer?

01:06:07.339 --> 01:06:09.899
Okay, we'll do it your way.

01:06:11.276 --> 01:06:13.403
This is Lange.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.981
Really?

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:20.174
Well, I got him
sitting right in front of me now.

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.112
Yes.

01:06:23.888 --> 01:06:25.185
Yes.

01:06:32.464 --> 01:06:34.022
I hear you.

01:06:35.567 --> 01:06:36.556
Thank you.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:41.232
Well, one thing's for sure.
This ain't your lucky day.

01:06:42.574 --> 01:06:45.475
They found the body
this morning in the river.

01:06:45.677 --> 01:06:48.771
They're bringing it into the morgue
now, so you can identify it.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.312
Is it my wife?

01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:53.982
Stay put.

01:07:08.099 --> 01:07:11.694
You know, I had you pegged for bad
the minute I laid eyes on you.

01:07:15.707 --> 01:07:19.768
Now, I want you to tell me
everything you remember happening.

01:07:19.978 --> 01:07:23.709
Exactly the way you told Lange.
But I want you to make one...

01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:27.216
...minor adjustment.
- What's that?

01:07:28.153 --> 01:07:30.781
Don't fucking lie to me.

01:07:30.989 --> 01:07:34.117
I just want to see my wife.
I just want to see my wife.

01:07:46.471 --> 01:07:49.099
I thought I asked you
to stay put.

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:54.305
Each killed with a single
gunshot wound to the head.

01:07:54.646 --> 01:07:58.047
Tortured, then shot.
We find the gun...

01:07:58.416 --> 01:08:01.351
we find the killer.
This way.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:11.854
Sick motherfucker!
Get off me!

01:08:12.063 --> 01:08:14.361
They're gonna fry your ass,
motherfucker!

01:08:14.566 --> 01:08:17.330
I'm gonna strangle
your fucking neck!

01:08:17.902 --> 01:08:21.201
- You've got quite the fan club.
- Please, don't.

01:08:21.406 --> 01:08:24.341
I didn't do it. I swear,
I didn't do it. Please!

01:08:29.281 --> 01:08:30.645
Here we go.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.250
Just about there.

01:10:08.747 --> 01:10:10.442
Thanks.

01:10:17.056 --> 01:10:20.685
What are you... what are you doing?
I thought you believed me.

01:10:21.193 --> 01:10:23.127
Believe?

01:10:23.629 --> 01:10:25.688
Here's what I believe, Trevor.

01:10:25.898 --> 01:10:29.129
I believe you and me
have a lot in common.

01:10:29.602 --> 01:10:32.503
I believe each of us
are the sum of two...

01:10:32.705 --> 01:10:35.640
entirely different people.

01:10:36.809 --> 01:10:38.436
No.

01:10:39.745 --> 01:10:42.111
I know who I am.

01:10:42.715 --> 01:10:44.876
And I'm not a killer.

01:10:45.084 --> 01:10:49.418
Denial to the end.
That's what I like about you, kid!

01:10:51.423 --> 01:10:53.948
Good and bad, Trevor.

01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:58.186
Honest, dishonest.
Righteous and evil.

01:10:58.397 --> 01:11:01.161
That's how we're all made.

01:11:01.367 --> 01:11:03.835
A little of both.

01:11:04.236 --> 01:11:09.003
It's just a question
of how much...

01:11:09.742 --> 01:11:11.801
of each.

01:11:23.422 --> 01:11:28.519
And we're made up of just
the right parts of both.

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:34.394
A little heavier on the evil, huh?

01:11:41.707 --> 01:11:44.107
It's all good, Trev.

01:11:44.443 --> 01:11:46.536
It's all good!

01:13:49.269 --> 01:13:51.635
Kirsty?

01:15:07.447 --> 01:15:11.281
It seems you've reached
the end of your journey.

01:15:15.588 --> 01:15:19.581
I told you you couldn't run
from your past forever.

01:15:19.893 --> 01:15:22.794
Eventually it catches up to you.

01:15:23.329 --> 01:15:25.729
And you must atone.

01:15:27.467 --> 01:15:29.492
And now...

01:15:29.969 --> 01:15:33.427
it is time for you
to pay the price.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.302
You were willing
to pay the price, weren't you?

01:15:40.781 --> 01:15:44.114
- I just want to see my wife.
- In time.

01:15:44.518 --> 01:15:48.454
- Let me see my wife.
- I said in time!

01:16:18.452 --> 01:16:20.682
"All problems solved"?

01:16:21.121 --> 01:16:22.850
Not so simple, I'm afraid.

01:16:23.857 --> 01:16:27.554
I needed first to open
the door for you.

01:16:29.897 --> 01:16:32.457
You were an interesting study.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.400
Lust, greed, deception,
fertile ground...

01:16:37.604 --> 01:16:42.268
but rather mundane. Let us
take one final journey together.

01:16:42.676 --> 01:16:47.238
Let me help you remember.
Once and for all.

01:16:47.448 --> 01:16:49.313
What have you done?

01:16:49.984 --> 01:16:52.384
It's just a puzzle.
Open it up.

01:16:52.786 --> 01:16:55.983
I trusted you.
I trusted you, goddamn it!

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:57.817
How could you do this to us?

01:16:58.292 --> 01:17:01.921
- You told me you loved me!
- Just open the fucking box.

01:17:02.196 --> 01:17:05.563
We were uninvited guests
at your little celebration.

01:17:06.433 --> 01:17:08.628
Is this what you want?

01:17:09.503 --> 01:17:11.095
Unseen by you.

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:15.199
I hope it's everything
you want it to be.

01:17:21.181 --> 01:17:23.547
I used you, Trevor.

01:17:24.351 --> 01:17:26.842
You were nothing more than bait.

01:17:27.688 --> 01:17:31.624
To lure a far more
interesting creature.

01:17:38.766 --> 01:17:43.135
Kirsty. We meet again.

01:17:43.704 --> 01:17:48.266
- How did you find me?
- You opened the door long ago.

01:17:48.475 --> 01:17:52.468
And it will not be closed
until I get what I came for.

01:17:53.714 --> 01:17:54.840
My soul.

01:17:55.049 --> 01:17:57.711
No!

01:17:58.318 --> 01:18:01.913
You solved the puzzle.
You unleashed the power.

01:18:02.122 --> 01:18:05.717
There is no turning back.
I will not rest...

01:18:05.926 --> 01:18:11.228
until I get what I want.
And what I want is you.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.302
You always knew
this day was coming.

01:18:22.509 --> 01:18:25.103
Felt it deep within your soul.

01:18:25.712 --> 01:18:27.441
Wait!

01:18:27.848 --> 01:18:29.679
Wait.

01:18:36.857 --> 01:18:38.984
What if I make you a deal?

01:18:39.493 --> 01:18:40.960
Interesting.

01:18:41.395 --> 01:18:45.161
I will bring you five souls
in exchange for mine.

01:18:45.866 --> 01:18:48.801
You would bring them
to me yourself?

01:18:49.736 --> 01:18:51.931
You'll get your five.

01:18:52.139 --> 01:18:54.607
I was impressed
with her handiwork.

01:18:56.076 --> 01:19:00.604
Three of your favorite companions
most supple and delicious.

01:19:02.282 --> 01:19:06.184
And the man with whom
you once conspired to kill Kirsty.

01:19:07.354 --> 01:19:09.845
They are all with me now.

01:19:10.524 --> 01:19:12.857
The balance is only four souls...

01:19:13.061 --> 01:19:17.395
and that, as you now know,
was not our contract.

01:19:18.566 --> 01:19:22.468
You have seen many things
that you'll wish you had not.

01:19:23.171 --> 01:19:24.798
All those women...

01:19:25.373 --> 01:19:28.399
in our home, in my bed.

01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:32.307
Many nightmares from which
you will never awake.

01:19:32.514 --> 01:19:35.881
- Oh, Kirsty, come on...
- Don't you lie to me! Don't!

01:19:36.084 --> 01:19:39.417
We can make it work and put the
pieces back together. Believe me.

01:19:39.621 --> 01:19:40.713
I am done believing!

01:19:40.955 --> 01:19:42.980
I trusted you!

01:19:43.191 --> 01:19:45.682
I can't believe this shit is
happening. I have a fucking deal.

01:19:51.032 --> 01:19:53.728
No, you had a deal.

01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:56.834
But I made a better offer.

01:19:59.874 --> 01:20:02.069
And guess what?

01:20:04.312 --> 01:20:06.712
- He took it.
- Welcome...

01:20:07.248 --> 01:20:11.582
to the worst nightmare of all.

01:20:13.488 --> 01:20:14.716
Reality.

01:21:16.618 --> 01:21:18.483
Fuck.

01:21:21.789 --> 01:21:23.950
I'm the fifth soul.

01:21:31.933 --> 01:21:34.424
Yeah, that's him.

01:21:37.305 --> 01:21:39.296
Okay, people, that's it.

01:21:44.746 --> 01:21:46.611
He just shot himself.

01:21:46.814 --> 01:21:50.477
Next thing I knew, we were in
the water, I couldn't see anything.

01:21:54.155 --> 01:21:57.522
- I lost him.
- You did what you could.

01:21:58.126 --> 01:22:01.721
- I'm sorry.
- It just doesn't make any sense.

01:22:02.397 --> 01:22:04.957
That he would be
capable of murder.

01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:08.499
We found the gun in your car.
It appears to be the same.

01:22:08.703 --> 01:22:11.831
If it matches, I think we may
have found our killer.

01:22:16.311 --> 01:22:18.370
Wait a minute, guys,
before you zip him up.

01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:23.977
Not your lucky day, was it?

01:22:24.485 --> 01:22:26.817
Check the oral cavity
for blockages?

01:22:28.089 --> 01:22:30.284
What have we got here?

01:22:41.002 --> 01:22:43.732
And we have a winner.

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:50.808
Okay, zip it up.
We'll finish at the morgue.

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:52.947
Wait, wait.

01:22:56.819 --> 01:23:00.277
Sorry I had to leave you like that
for a minute, Trev. I'm back.

01:23:02.257 --> 01:23:04.088
Can you hear me, Trevor?

01:23:04.293 --> 01:23:07.922
Jesus, Allison. What possesses
you to talk to cadavers?

01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:10.093
What if there's no afterlife?

01:23:10.299 --> 01:23:13.996
Wouldn't you want someone to talk
to you like a normal human being?

01:23:21.176 --> 01:23:24.475
You're creeping me out.
And I'm the coroner.

01:23:42.898 --> 01:23:45.992
I've arranged a ride home for you,
so I guess you're free to go.

01:23:47.102 --> 01:23:50.094
Thank you, Detective.
For everything.

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.332
Ah, one more thing.

01:23:56.612 --> 01:23:59.012
I wonder if you know
anything about this.

01:23:59.248 --> 01:24:01.580
We found it in the car.

01:24:09.358 --> 01:24:12.850
Yeah.
It was my anniversary gift.

01:24:15.397 --> 01:24:18.457
You know, I was gonna
turn it in as evidence.

01:24:20.102 --> 01:24:23.868
But I'll tell you what.
Why don't you take it home?

01:24:25.908 --> 01:24:28.877
Something to remember him by.

01:24:35.317 --> 01:24:38.309
Of course. Thank you.
