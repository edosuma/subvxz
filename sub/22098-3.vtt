00:25.192 --> 00:27.777
This will be Adama's command
until the day he dies.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.279
And we are not
going to let him die.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.741
GAETA: Sir, what about our
people on the surface of Kobol?

00:33.826 --> 00:36.452
TIGH: If they're still alive,
they'll have to wait.

00:36.787 --> 00:40.039
El-tee, I think we should double-check
the supplies before we bug out.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.541
We don't have
the time, Chief.

00:42.418 --> 00:45.503
I could give you a shot, but you
wouldn't like the side effects.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.964
Just do it.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.968
The time is going to come when
you're not going to be able to hide

what you're going through.

00:55.139 --> 00:58.474
His lungs are filling up with fluid,
if he doesn't get more Serisone soon,

00:58.559 --> 00:59.892
he's not gonna make it.

01:00.310 --> 01:04.147
Tarn, you forgot the med kit, so
you've got to go back and get it.

Lords of Kobol,

take these brave men
into your arms.

Take up... Take

so that they may share
in the everlasting life

beyond the veil of tears.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.025

01:54.573 --> 01:58.284
Nothing awaits them. No
eternal life. No damnation.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.870
Only oblivion.

02:02.498 --> 02:05.333
Because they haven't seen
the face of God, I take it?

02:05.709 --> 02:09.754
Because they died here,
on Kobol.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.298
I see.

TYROL: Doc, let's go.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.553
We're moving out.

02:20.516 --> 02:22.308
Doc, you hear me?

02:24.561 --> 02:25.603
We're moving out.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.147
No, I did hear you, Chief.

Wait a minute.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.959
Got them.
What're they doing?

they're dismantling the ship.

it to fly the hell out of here?

03:35.966 --> 03:37.550
I don't know.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.801
I can't tell.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.013
They're dragging it
into the tree line.

Oh, wait a minute.
They're building something.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.726

Chief, is that a...

03:46.810 --> 03:50.104
A missile. They're
building a missile battery.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.441
Well, at least we know
why they're not chasing us.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.154
Why?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.698
Why aren't they chasing us?

04:00.782 --> 04:01.991
Because they don't have to.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.413
(SIGHING) They can just sit
back, launch a missile barrage

04:07.497 --> 04:09.749

the other nicked the aorta.

Now, we've removed the spleen
and felt we repaired the aorta...

Over the past few hours, his
B. P.'s dropped down again.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.331
It's only 80/40, and his heart
rate's creeping back into the 130s.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.292
Well, you missed something. He's
still hemorrhaging somewhere.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.216
We're gonna lose him unless
we can stop that bleeding.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.511
Get me an ABG,
CBC and coags

05:03.595 --> 05:05.888
and get set up for a
rapid sequence intubation.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.306

I don't think
he can last much longer.

For who?

07:31.660 --> 07:33.744

and nobody tells me?

07:37.249 --> 07:41.794
For our Raptor crew down on
the surface of Kobol, sir.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.341
Simes is senior pilot now.
He can plan the SAR.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.427
You asked me to command the air group
when I'm on duty, and I'm on duty,

07:50.512 --> 07:52.596
so am I in command or not?

APOLLO: Well, we don't know in
what area Raptor 3 went down.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.655
So the only realistic chance
we have of finding her

is the hope that her transponder or
disaster beacon is still functioning.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.118

take two Raptors,

08:14.202 --> 08:17.580

08:22.627 --> 08:24.712
Racetrack confirmed the
destruction of the base ship

08:24.796 --> 08:28.799
and I checked the gun-camera footage
from the Raptors, which verifies it.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.304
Lt. Gaeta, why are you
hovering about?

08:33.388 --> 08:34.430
It's the press.

The press?

much longer we plan on holding them

contact their home-ships.

We kill them,
and they kill us.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.228
So we kill
more of them and

10:51.276 --> 10:53.152
so they kill more of us.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.611
What's the point anymore?

You, your race
invented murder.

Yes, well, we're your

Why does God want to bring a child
into this kind of world, anyway?

Because despite everything,
despite all of it,

11:20.597 --> 11:22.973

offer you salvation.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.396

from the nose cone of a ship.

There are no other

12:36.756 --> 12:38.966
The Galactica's gonna send
a search and rescue team.

12:39.050 --> 12:42.970
When they do, that's at least two Raptors
doing a low pass over the crash site.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.724
When those Raptors come looking for
us, risking their lives to rescue us...

12:47.809 --> 12:49.351

shoot them down.

to do this for me?

13:38.276 --> 13:40.152
Never was much
at public speaking, sir.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.237
So why are we here?
That's what I want to know.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.156

She caused a key military asset
to be lost at a critical moment.

The Commander felt he had no
choice but to remove her from power.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.002
You've said that.
Several times.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.296
Well, I... You don't seem
to be listening, Colonel.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.299
It does not matter what Adama felt,
he had absolutely no authority...

14:02.383 --> 14:04.760
Adama knew exactly
what he was doing.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.513
He was paving the way
to declare martial law

14:07.597 --> 14:09.014
and usher in
a military dictatorship.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.474
Isn't that right,
Colonel?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.267
I can't speak
for the Commander.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.564
He's still in surgery.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.858
Well, you seem to be giving
the orders around here,

14:19.943 --> 14:22.611
so what exactly are
you planning to do?

14:23.321 --> 14:24.488
Are you declaring
martial law?

14:24.572 --> 14:25.656
Absolutely not.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.868
I know for a fact that the old man
hated the very idea of martial law.

14:30.620 --> 14:34.706
He believed in freedom and
democracy, and all that good stuff.

14:35.166 --> 14:39.419
Well, since this is still a
democracy and "all that good stuff",

14:39.796 --> 14:43.173
I move that the Quorum demand
immediate access to President Roslin.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.883
Excellent.
I second it.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.052
PORTER: All those in favor?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.220
ALL: Aye.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.304
ZAREK: Aye.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.723
Motion carries.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.726
Colonel, we demand immediate
access to the President.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.487
I will take your "demand"
under advisement.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.990
ELLEN: Madam President.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.701
...anything that impedes
that understanding...

15:10.785 --> 15:11.994
Madam President?

15:12.579 --> 15:13.662
I have to consider...

15:13.746 --> 15:14.788
Laura?

15:19.794 --> 15:20.877
Laura?

15:26.301 --> 15:27.301
Hello.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.510
Hi.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.387
Are you all right?

15:36.227 --> 15:40.439
I just came down to see if there
was anything I could do for you.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.024
Anything I can get you?

15:51.576 --> 15:54.494
I would like to have a
conversation with my attorney.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.912
Could you arrange that?

15:55.997 --> 15:57.080
(CHUCKLES)

15:57.165 --> 15:58.707
Yeah, sure, right.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.422
Laura, do you know
where you are?

16:06.841 --> 16:08.050
I'm in jail.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.552
What's my name?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.387
Have we met?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.391
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

16:17.310 --> 16:21.104
It's just the ringing.
Excuse me.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.898
The ringing?

16:29.697 --> 16:30.697
Right.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.993
Okay, then. Take care.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.246
(GROANING)

16:39.916 --> 16:41.416
(METAL CLANGS)

16:42.335 --> 16:43.710
(EXCLAIMS)

16:47.382 --> 16:51.134
Oh, my gods. Ellen Tigh.

16:51.928 --> 16:52.928
Ellen?

16:55.598 --> 16:56.598
Ellen.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.986
Lords of Kobol...

17:35.138 --> 17:37.848
CRASHDOWN: The launcher looks
like a simple point and shoot,

17:37.932 --> 17:39.641
no built-in guidance.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.227
TYROL: Ordnance appear to be
standard ship-to-ship missiles.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.563
They're modifying it
for atmospheric flight.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.107
CALLY: One Cylon Centurion
walks the perimeter,

17:47.191 --> 17:49.109
stopping at
regular intervals.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.821
BALTAR: The dradis dish
that controls the missiles

17:53.406 --> 17:57.784
is on a 4.5 kG wavelength,
judging by the diameter.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.787
It's guarded by
two Centurions, I think.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.832
Sorry, Doc, did you say it
was guarded by two Centurions?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.001
Yes, I did.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.421
Okay. Is the dradis guarded
continuously or intermittently?

18:11.507 --> 18:14.593
I saw two Centurions,
through the field glasses,

18:14.677 --> 18:16.470
continuously
for five minutes.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.306
In that time they
didn't leave their post.

18:35.239 --> 18:39.993
So there's three toasters near the
launcher, two more out by the dish.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.370
That's a lot of Cylons.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.209
You ever handle a weapon?

18:51.005 --> 18:54.049
Who, me? No.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.802
I'm not a soldier, Crashdown.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.720
I'll try to give you
the most simple assignment,

18:58.805 --> 18:59.805
but I'm going
to need every man.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.140
You're not suggesting
we attack the Cylons?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.810
We owe it to Socinus
and Tarn to take those

19:04.894 --> 19:07.062
frakkers out before
they kill anyone else.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.858
We have equal numbers. We
have the element of surprise.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.235
Therefore we have
the initiative.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.695
We can attack at a time
and place of our choosing.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.578
El-tee, a word in private.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.418
He's crazy.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.087
I'm not trained for
this kind of thing.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.548
I've never fired
a gun in my life.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.591
I haven't fired
one since Basic.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.052
You?

19:39.136 --> 19:41.429
I just joined to pay
for dental school.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.187
Basic Ground Assault was a
long time ago for all of us.

19:49.272 --> 19:50.897
Those aren't training
officers out there,

19:50.940 --> 19:53.400
they're programmed killing
machines. We don't have any choice.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.819
Galactica will definitely be
sending a search and rescue party.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.321
It's just a matter of time. If
we don't take out that launcher...

19:58.406 --> 20:00.991
We can't go up against an armed
and defended position like that.

20:01.075 --> 20:03.618
They'll wipe us out in the
first two minutes. That's enough!

20:05.997 --> 20:09.541
Chief, look, under the circumstances,
it's important that you keep your cool.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.586
I don't believe
I've lost my cool.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.837
I disagree.

20:14.297 --> 20:18.008
Look, I don't want to attack the
launcher, either, but it's our duty.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.386
We owe it to the rescue party,
and we owe it to Socinus and Tarn.

20:23.806 --> 20:26.474
I fail to see what this has
to do with Socinus and Tarn.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.311
Maybe that's why I'm an
officer and you're not.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.068
Dismissed.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.713
CRASHDOWN: This briefing will outline
a plan of attack in five graphs.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.673
Graph 1: Situation.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.259
Our situation is that
we are stranded on Kobol

21:01.344 --> 21:02.677
with a group of five Cylons

21:02.762 --> 21:06.681
who are planning to use an AAU to
destroy any SAR aircraft sent to find us.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.350
There are no other
friendly forces present.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.352
What's all this "graph"
business? Graph 2: Mission.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.437
It's a five paragraph order.
... to destroy the AAU...

21:12.521 --> 21:15.231
It's a Basic command tool. It's
taught at officer candidate school.

21:15.691 --> 21:20.362
It's just not usually used
this literally in the field.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.449
Graph 4: Execution.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.953
We will assault the Cylon launch
site from the northwest, using...

21:28.037 --> 21:29.037
Oh, come on!

21:30.331 --> 21:31.539
This is absurd.

21:32.208 --> 21:36.711
What, we're taking on the Cylon
Army, are we? Us? Look at us.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.005
What, with two rifles
and a canteen?

21:39.090 --> 21:40.966
Have you lost your mind...
That's enough, Doctor.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.260
Is it? Look, no disrespect, but
why are we always going uphill?

21:44.762 --> 21:46.972
Does anyone else think that
his plan is frakking nuts?

21:47.056 --> 21:49.683
I'll tell you what's fair, this is
fair. We'll have a show of hands.

21:49.767 --> 21:50.767
No! Absolutely not!

21:50.851 --> 21:51.893
Now everybody who
thinks it's unfair...

21:51.978 --> 21:53.645
This is not a democracy.
Well, it's not...

21:53.729 --> 21:56.398
The El-tee's in charge.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.816
No ifs, no ands,
no buts.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.317
He say we go, we go!

21:59.402 --> 22:00.485
There's no questions.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.195
We've already lost
two men, Chief!

22:02.279 --> 22:04.280
How many more people
are we gonna lose?

22:08.285 --> 22:10.412
You need to sit down
and shut up right now.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.664
Nobody tells me to shut up.
I am the Vice President...

22:12.748 --> 22:15.208
You need to sit down
and shut up, right now.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.427
Your briefing, El-tee.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.471
Thank you, Chief.

22:30.433 --> 22:34.436
Graph 4: We will approach the
Cylon launch site from the northwest

22:34.520 --> 22:37.647
using natural ground cover
to mask our approach.

22:38.441 --> 22:41.818
Our objective is the command
and control console.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.070
Once we reach this position,

22:44.155 --> 22:47.782
Cally, you're gonna
flank out to the left,

22:47.992 --> 22:49.784
making a feint on
the Cylon position,

22:49.869 --> 22:52.662
hopefully drawing their fire
long enough for me and Seelix

22:53.289 --> 22:56.624
to flank out to the right
and get a shot at the console.

22:57.334 --> 23:02.088
Tyrol, you and the Vice President
will stay at position one,

23:02.214 --> 23:04.507
provide covering fire
for both flanking maneuvers.

23:06.135 --> 23:09.846
I have been given the opportunity
to perceive from the scriptures...

23:11.807 --> 23:15.351
In peace I believe...

23:17.354 --> 23:20.398
This is ridiculous.
Look.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.734
She obviously needs
her medication.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.194
I keep trying to tell
anyone that'll listen...

23:24.278 --> 23:27.197
It sounds like she's talking about
the scrolls of the Prophet Pythia.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.323
I suppose.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.076
Pythia foretold
the rise of a leader.

23:32.286 --> 23:35.246
A leader who would lead
all humanity to salvation.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.540
So say the gods.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.590
You seem to know
a lot about the scriptures.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.966
I'm from Gemenon.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.511
We believe in the literal
truth of the scriptures.

23:52.056 --> 23:55.683
Corporal Venner, there's

23:56.185 --> 23:57.852
a drug that
priests sometimes use.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.562
It's called chamalla extract.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.196
I guess
it's happy hour.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.697
What's happy about it?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.664
Yeah. The old man's
still in surgery.

24:18.707 --> 24:19.707
(SIGHING)

24:19.792 --> 24:22.794
I got a boatload of
politicians and press

24:22.878 --> 24:24.754
demanding to see
Laura Roslin.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.423
Let them.
Yeah, right.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.801
She's crazy.
I know.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.803
No, no, really, Saul.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.638
She's lost it.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.807
I just went down to
the brig to see her.

24:35.891 --> 24:36.975
You did?

24:37.059 --> 24:40.436
She's completely nuts.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.314
She doesn't even know
where she is anymore.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.482
You're kidding.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.109
You should let them see her.

24:46.902 --> 24:50.613
The press, the Quorum,
all of them.

24:50.865 --> 24:55.076
I mean, the little school teacher's
mind has gone bye-bye and the

24:55.494 --> 24:58.413
Vice President is
either missing or dead.

25:00.624 --> 25:05.503
That leaves you in unchallenged
command of this ship and this fleet.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.797
Just until the old man
gets back on his feet.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.592
Well, of course.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.936
Galactica, Apollo. We are
preparing to jump to Kobol.

25:22.104 --> 25:25.523
Roger that, Apollo. You are
cleared to jump. Good hunting.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.400
Thank you, Galactica.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.235
Let's go find our people.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.162
Okay, cock the rifle, click
the safety, open the scope.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.043
Cock the rifle, click the
safety, open the scope.

25:45.794 --> 25:46.878
Cock the rifle...

25:46.962 --> 25:49.964
NO. 6: One of you will
turn against the others.

25:50.341 --> 25:51.799
During the mission?

25:52.801 --> 25:54.177
Yes.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.012
One of us will betray the others? Yes.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.680
During the attack?
Yes.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.976
But if the attack fails?

26:03.145 --> 26:05.104
You'll die.

26:05.564 --> 26:09.817
Not me.
I am God's instrument.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.031
God turned his back on Kobol.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.077
Turned his back on man and
the false gods he worshipped.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.121
What happens on Kobol
is not his will.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.831
CRASHDOWN: Saddle up.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.544
It's time to junk
some toasters.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.876
(PHONE RINGING)

27:15.926 --> 27:16.968
XO.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.636
Combat. Dualla here, sir.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.306
The Quorum is demanding to
see the former President.

27:21.390 --> 27:24.434
They're being pretty adamant, and
they're giving the sentries a hard time.

27:24.518 --> 27:27.812
Well, maybe we should tell them to shove
their demand up their collective asses.

27:27.896 --> 27:28.980
How about that?

27:29.064 --> 27:30.606
(TIGH LAUGHING)

27:35.195 --> 27:37.989
Yes, sir. I need
instructions for the sentries.

27:38.407 --> 27:39.574
They're asking
how to respond.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.993
Tell them that they
are going to get to see

27:42.077 --> 27:46.205
what has become of their precious
President. You tell them that.

28:05.934 --> 28:08.519
I got a transponder signal.
Definitely Colonial.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.563
Trying to establish a lock.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.024
Got it.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.904
Northern hemisphere. Looks
like mountainous terrain.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.489
There's a valley.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.407
Take us out of orbit.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.369
Signal Raptor 2
to form up on us.

28:40.260 --> 28:44.347
There they are, all three of them,
right where they're supposed to be.

28:44.807 --> 28:46.557
All right, people. This
is it. We're going in.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.351
Cally, you move up the
tree line to point alpha.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.187
Whoa, El-tee. There's five
Cylons at the launcher.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.022

Something's wrong with the plan?

29:01.448 --> 29:03.116
Quiet down,
there's nothing wrong.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.618
There's just a couple Cylons
that we didn't account for.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.663
That makes for seven Cylons,
five here and two up at the dish.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.416
Are you absolutely certain
about the two guards at the dish?

29:13.919 --> 29:15.586
I know what I saw.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.256
Maybe there are
only five Cylons.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.674
They just changed
their deployment.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.926
They brought the two that were
guarding the dish down here.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.136
Now the dish
is unprotected.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.557
God, Chief, that dish is,
like, almost a klick away.

29:28.016 --> 29:31.144
So what? It's unprotected.
We can go take it out.

29:31.228 --> 29:32.937
We don't have to take on
the whole Cylon army.

no time for discussion.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.454
All right, everyone up,
move out. It's game time.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.123

30:10.058 --> 30:12.602
She doesn't have to. We could
just go take out the dish!

30:12.853 --> 30:15.897

Cally, this is not a joke. Go!

30:16.064 --> 30:18.441

double back and take out the dish.

three Cylons and now there are five.

to take on five Cylons?

any time. Move!

I can't do it.

No!

I'd like to make.

36:02.911 --> 36:06.705
The attempted military coup against
the lawful government of the Colonies

36:06.790 --> 36:10.251
is illegal, ill-advised, and
clearly doomed to failure.

36:10.544 --> 36:14.547

Go ahead and ask her.
Ask her, she'll tell you.

36:23.306 --> 36:27.059
Just listen to her. What
was it? The Arrow of Apollo

36:27.143 --> 36:30.688
will open the tomb of
Artemis, or some such nonsense.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.148
Everything I have done
is consistent, logical.

36:33.233 --> 36:36.819
We have found Kobol. We have
found the city of the gods.

36:36.903 --> 36:40.990
And when we retrieve the Arrow,
we will open the tomb of Athena

36:41.741 --> 36:43.951
and we will find
the road to Earth.

the role of the leader.

Okay, enough of this
nonsense. Everybody out.

Sarah, you represent Gemenon,
you know more about the scrolls

37:05.724 --> 37:08.475
and the scriptures than anybody
else here. Why don't you speak up?

37:08.560 --> 37:12.479
The scrolls tell us that a dying
leader will lead us to salvation.

to live.
