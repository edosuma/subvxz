WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:04.404
[narrator]
Previously, on Halo.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.773
[Parangosky] We've been fighting
these alien creatures for years,

00:06.840 --> 00:09.008
and we still have no idea
what they want.

00:09.075 --> 00:11.111
[Professor]
Spartans aren't human.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.646
They're faster,
stronger, smarter.

00:13.713 --> 00:16.383
They just keep on killing.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.320
No!

00:20.387 --> 00:22.155
[John] Commencing search of
the area for enemy landing site.

00:22.222 --> 00:24.190
Covenant forces appear
to be excavating

00:24.257 --> 00:26.393
for some kind of object.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.194
[Makee, in alien language]

00:35.235 --> 00:36.369
Retrieving now.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.804
[Mercy, in alien language]

00:42.175 --> 00:44.744
[John] I saw things
when I touched the object.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.379
-A family.
-The security committee's

00:46.446 --> 00:48.715
looking for an excuse
to cut your funding.

00:48.782 --> 00:52.085
No cloning, no Cortana.
Is that clear?

00:52.152 --> 00:55.255
[Miranda]
You didn't order an Article 72.

00:55.321 --> 00:57.323
We're murdering a teenage girl.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.759
[John] You're gonna need
to listen to me.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.161
Why should I trust you?

01:02.395 --> 01:03.663
[John]
You want me dead...

01:03.730 --> 01:05.598
you'll need to aim up here.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.567
-What are you doing?
-[John] I'm trying to help you.

01:07.634 --> 01:08.835
If this ship lands,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.770
they will remove you
and execute you.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.338
[Parangosky] Put out the alarm.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.339
Scramble everyone
to landing bay.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.675
Full squadron protocol.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.178
Protect Master Chief from anyone

01:18.244 --> 01:20.280
who actively
threatens his life.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.649
[Keyes]
Knock it down!

01:22.715 --> 01:24.517
[Kwan]
You just decided to help me?

01:24.584 --> 01:27.420
Why would a Spartan do that?

01:27.487 --> 01:29.189
I don't know.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.429
Strap in.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.631
[indistinct shouting]

02:48.735 --> 02:50.537
[aircraft flying overhead]

02:57.844 --> 02:58.811
[dogs barking]

02:58.878 --> 03:01.681
[vehicle engines chugging]

03:06.019 --> 03:07.353
Soren.

03:08.421 --> 03:09.556
Soren!

03:09.622 --> 03:11.291
John.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.692
Where's your armor, man?

03:14.961 --> 03:16.329
Where's your ditch bag?

03:19.699 --> 03:20.867
I'm not going.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.535
What are you talking about?

03:25.838 --> 03:27.707
I can't let you go.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.578
What changed your mind?

03:32.645 --> 03:34.213
Every Spartan has the duty

03:34.280 --> 03:34.914
to prevent actions
that will harm the program.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.683
John, stop! Stop!

03:36.749 --> 03:39.285
If you fail to comply
with my orders, I will be--

03:39.352 --> 03:41.254
I will be compelled to use
all necessary means,

03:41.321 --> 03:43.222
including lethal force
to blah-biddy blah.

03:43.289 --> 03:46.559
That ain't training, man.
That's programming.

03:48.328 --> 03:49.462
I mean it, Soren.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.931
Man.

03:54.601 --> 03:57.837
Didn't all those dreams we had
mean anything?

04:00.840 --> 04:02.375
I don't have dreams.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.843
That's what I'm here for.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.379
I'll do the dreaming
for the both of us.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.815
Look...

04:08.881 --> 04:10.650
We'll be on the Rubble
by morning.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.452
Have a good breakfast.

04:12.518 --> 04:13.886
No one will find us there.

04:13.953 --> 04:15.288
John, it's a fresh start.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.464
This place...

04:24.530 --> 04:26.332
This place cost me my arm.

04:27.634 --> 04:28.968
And what's good about that

04:29.035 --> 04:32.305
is you can see
what Halsey did.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.340
But what she's taking
from you, John...

04:37.944 --> 04:39.946
I'm not even sure you'll
realize when it's gone.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.750
[scoffs]

04:45.451 --> 04:46.586
Don't.

04:50.590 --> 04:51.991
If I want it
to be anyone, John...

04:53.893 --> 04:55.561
I want it to be you.

04:57.096 --> 04:58.431
Either way...

05:02.402 --> 05:04.003
I'm a free man.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.783
It appears that the firearm

05:16.849 --> 05:18.351
available to me at
this moment is jammed.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.921
Come with me.

05:23.956 --> 05:26.092
You've got five minutes,

05:26.159 --> 05:28.995
and then I'm waking up
the entire camp.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.598
-Make it ten?
-Five!

05:57.824 --> 05:59.058
Whoa.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.036
[Kwan]
How fast are we going?

06:11.571 --> 06:13.439
[John]
It's not about the speed.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.743
We're taking a more direct path
through space.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.377
[Kwan]
What?

06:18.444 --> 06:20.713
If you think of space
like a ball of yarn

06:20.780 --> 06:22.648
with multiple threads
to the same destination--

06:22.715 --> 06:24.117
You're ruining it.

06:28.888 --> 06:33.793
That thing you took
from Madrigal, what is it?

06:34.660 --> 06:35.995
Don't know.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.632
How'd you make it
start the ship?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.435
Don't know.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.803
"Don't know."

06:45.505 --> 06:46.906
Okay.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.845
Why are you doing this?

06:52.912 --> 06:56.983
Why didn't you just take me in,
let them kill me?

07:02.588 --> 07:04.690
Would you let a kid
be executed?

07:04.757 --> 07:06.192
[scoffs]
No.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.529
Why not?

07:09.595 --> 07:10.930
Because it's wrong.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.436
That's what I was thinking.

07:22.642 --> 07:23.810
Thank you.

07:28.247 --> 07:29.582
You're welcome.

08:43.589 --> 08:45.124
[jet engines roaring]

08:47.627 --> 08:49.128
[Halsey]
Yes, Silver Team is gearing up

08:49.195 --> 08:51.530
to bring in Master Chief
peacefully.

08:51.597 --> 08:53.866
[Hood] Let's talk about
how One-One-Seven escaped.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.735
[Halsey]
I think it has something to do

08:55.801 --> 08:58.771
with the object that he was
bringing back from Madrigal.

08:58.838 --> 09:02.808
It's capable of creating
enormous energy fields.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.277
[Hood]
What is it exactly?

09:04.343 --> 09:06.245
I don't know.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.281
I think that's the first
I've ever heard

09:08.347 --> 09:12.051
the brilliant Catherine Halsey
utter the words "I don't know."

09:12.118 --> 09:14.620
What I do know is that
the Covenant sent two ships

09:14.687 --> 09:16.923
and 20 Elite warriors
to try and retrieve it.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.958
Well, then we want it too.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.226
Exactly.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.594
And when we find
the Master Chief...

09:23.262 --> 09:24.897
what does one do
with a superhuman

09:24.964 --> 09:26.832
you're not sure
you can trust?

09:26.899 --> 09:28.834
I am sure I can trust him.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.071
But to assuage any doubt,

09:32.138 --> 09:34.974
Admiral Parangosky and I
have devised

09:35.041 --> 09:37.910
an insurance plan
for the future.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.979
Do you know how I rose
to this position?

09:41.380 --> 09:44.817
By keeping my mind clear
of unnecessary concerns.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.320
So if you have a plan,

09:47.386 --> 09:49.155
the committee
should hear it.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.625
Just keep it light.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.929
[jets flying overhead]

09:56.996 --> 09:59.065
[Vannak]
Still no contact,

09:59.131 --> 10:01.834
and his beacon is turned off.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.636
He's gonna come back.

10:03.703 --> 10:04.870
He wouldn't just leave us.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.039
Chief's always got a plan.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.841
[Riz]
Kai, Vannak,

10:08.908 --> 10:10.810
slipspace vector tracking
on the Condor just came in.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.746
We won't have his exact
location, but we'll be close.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.383
[Kai]
Vannak.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.952
If he's got a plan,
why are we going after him?

10:20.019 --> 10:22.922
Halsey's orders.
We'll find out when we need to.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.678
[alarm tweeting]

10:45.745 --> 10:47.713
-What's that sound?
-Proximity alarm.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.889
We exited slipspace
into an asteroid field.

10:56.956 --> 10:57.790
[Kwan]
Oh, my God!

10:59.458 --> 11:01.894
-We're gonna die!
-Everything dies.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.295
Sit down and buckle up.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.231
Tell me you have a plan.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.334
Sit down.

11:08.401 --> 11:09.802
Buckle up.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.837
[panting]

11:17.443 --> 11:19.378
[groaning]

11:19.445 --> 11:20.913
No, no, no!

11:20.980 --> 11:22.381
[alarm beeps rapidly]

11:24.850 --> 11:26.185
[loud rumble]

11:26.252 --> 11:28.120
[breathing heavily]

12:29.448 --> 12:31.283
-[panel beeps]
-[door hinges creak]

12:34.353 --> 12:36.388
[indistinct chatter]

12:38.958 --> 12:40.426
-[Trokan] Squirrel.
-[Squirrel] What is it?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.062
[speaking Hungarian]

12:44.163 --> 12:45.764
Get the boss.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.833
-[guns cock]
-Oi!

12:47.900 --> 12:49.502
[indistinct chatter]

13:02.047 --> 13:02.982
Spartan.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.993
This is your plan?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.062
We're fine.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.165
Willy!

13:32.478 --> 13:35.047
[men laughing]

13:37.516 --> 13:39.018
[grunts]

13:40.219 --> 13:41.887
[laughs]

13:43.355 --> 13:45.591
[loud scraping]

13:57.970 --> 14:00.940
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your weapons down.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.109
If John here wanted you dead,

14:04.176 --> 14:05.311
you'd be dead.

14:07.646 --> 14:10.049
Nice of you to drop by.

14:15.087 --> 14:16.889
Hello, Soren.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.190
Look at you.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.631
Welcome to the Rubble.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.000
Let me show you
what you missed out on.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.638
Soren, this is Kwan Ha.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.206
I'm looking for
a place for her.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.207
You're the one that they

14:35.274 --> 14:36.575
just issued a bounty for.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.477
UNSC is offering a bounty?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.646
-[man] Back to work!
-[Soren] UNSC? No.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.082
Well, who's the new top cat
on Madrigal?

14:43.148 --> 14:45.351
-Vinsher.
-Vinsher?

14:45.417 --> 14:47.519
He's a traitor
to the resistance.

14:47.586 --> 14:51.490
Apparently, uh, the UNSC's
preferred replacement

14:51.557 --> 14:54.193
didn't just take
your father's office,

14:54.260 --> 14:55.494
he's cleaning house.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.063
Offering cash for your head,
literally.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.598
Should I have
not said it like that?

15:02.101 --> 15:04.270
Wait, you thought
that it was the UNSC

15:04.336 --> 15:06.238
that was offering
a bounty, so--

15:06.305 --> 15:07.506
So they also want me dead.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.443
Damn.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.445
You're making friends
all over.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.147
[indistinct chatter]

15:17.416 --> 15:18.584
[horn beeps]

15:23.989 --> 15:25.324
Here it is.

15:25.391 --> 15:28.527
Home to every misfit,
reprobate, outlaw,

15:28.594 --> 15:30.095
and renegade
in the galaxy.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.530
-No law.
-Ah!

15:31.597 --> 15:35.200
No police. No government.
No responsibility.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.037
It's everything
we always talked about, man.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.140
Absolute freedom,
just like I always promised.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.243
-[rumbling]
-[electricity crackles]

15:57.523 --> 15:58.991
Mind the gap.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.702
[cable car rumbling]

16:26.218 --> 16:28.120
Got a whole rock to myself.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.025
Go where I want to go,
do what I want to do.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.062
I'm happy for you.

16:37.129 --> 16:38.364
Well, I can see that.

16:43.369 --> 16:44.503
[grunts]

17:35.554 --> 17:37.556
So many secrets.

18:03.382 --> 18:04.550
Daddy! Daddy!

18:04.616 --> 18:06.618
-Hey!
-[giggles]

18:06.685 --> 18:08.353
This little guy's name
is Kessler.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.721
[chuckles]

18:09.788 --> 18:11.190
You have a child?

18:11.256 --> 18:12.624
[Kessler]
Did you bring me anything?

18:12.691 --> 18:14.693
I'm a pirate.
That's what we do.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.695
-But not till after dinner.
-Aw.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.230
Go get your mom.
We got company.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.633
You can leave
your gear here.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.802
I just redid the floors.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.370
Ah.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.105
[chuckles]
My wife, Laera.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.508
My galactic princess.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.577
It's kind of you
to have us.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.413
John.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.517
Soren speaks of you so often.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.819
[Soren]
Not that often, my dear.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.721
Not that often.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.574
[Makee, speaking alien language]

19:24.530 --> 19:25.831
[snarls]

20:54.920 --> 20:56.822
[Keyes]
Governor Vinsher has control

20:56.888 --> 20:59.024
of the situation
on Madrigal,

20:59.091 --> 21:01.460
but perhaps with somewhat
more of an iron fist

21:01.526 --> 21:03.729
than we anticipated
when we put him in charge.

21:03.795 --> 21:06.898
Vinsher's crude, but he's
a reliable business partner.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.867
The deuterium
will soon be flowing,

21:08.934 --> 21:11.436
and the relative calm
has had a positive effect

21:11.503 --> 21:13.271
on fuel prices
across the galaxy.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.540
The other colonies
have taken notice.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.676
Well done, Keyes.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.578
For once,
some positive news.

21:19.645 --> 21:23.482
Captain Keyes, is there any word
on the Master Chief?

21:23.548 --> 21:25.751
The search for him
continues.

21:25.817 --> 21:28.020
I have no doubt we'll find him,
and when we do,

21:28.086 --> 21:29.821
I can assure you,

21:29.888 --> 21:32.457
his punishment will be
commensurate with his crimes.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.960
[Hood]
Is that wise?

21:35.027 --> 21:37.963
Master Chief is not only
a valuable battle asset,

21:38.030 --> 21:39.898
he's a symbol
for the whole war effort.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.534
Punishment not only puts him
out of commission,

21:42.601 --> 21:44.936
it could be very bad
for morale.

21:45.003 --> 21:47.305
But what good is he
to the war effort

21:47.372 --> 21:48.607
if he can't be controlled?

21:48.674 --> 21:50.609
[murmuring]

21:50.676 --> 21:54.012
Actually, Admiral Parangosky
and I have been ahead of this

21:54.079 --> 21:55.347
for some time.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.449
I've developed a new system

21:57.516 --> 21:59.584
which will solve John's
current issues

21:59.651 --> 22:02.988
and expand Spartan capability
across the board.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.892
It's called Cortana.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.796
And how does it work?

22:10.862 --> 22:12.397
Spartan bodies
have been enhanced

22:12.464 --> 22:14.433
to the limits
of our current technology,

22:14.499 --> 22:16.501
so Cortana will do something
similar for their minds.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.837
It will overwrite
Spartan consciousness

22:18.904 --> 22:22.841
and replace it with a artificial
general intelligence.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.377
The first of its kind.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.412
I don't understand.

22:28.914 --> 22:32.784
Cortana is the next stage
in human evolution.

22:37.789 --> 22:40.659
[Halsey] The Spartans
were the first step.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.761
Cortana is the upgrade.

22:46.798 --> 22:51.103
She represents the sum total
of every available data point.

22:52.838 --> 22:55.640
The intelligence of the galaxy,
in essence.

22:57.776 --> 23:02.147
With Cortana, we will create
Spartans who are more lethal...

23:03.548 --> 23:06.518
their judgment error-free,

23:06.585 --> 23:09.387
their performance
upgradeable,

23:09.454 --> 23:12.457
and, most importantly,

23:12.524 --> 23:13.892
controllable.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.093
[Keyes]
And what about John?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.928
You can't just replace his mind.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.398
We are talking about a person.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.801
John is much more
than a person.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.770
He is a Spartan.

23:26.705 --> 23:30.041
For his own safety and for ours,
John doesn't feel as we do.

23:30.108 --> 23:33.111
Hormonal pellets
have suppressed his emotions.

23:33.178 --> 23:36.414
John was enhanced and trained
for one purpose:

23:36.481 --> 23:38.450
to fight for us.

23:38.517 --> 23:41.186
And at the moment,
he and the other Spartans

23:41.253 --> 23:45.824
are our only effective weapons
against the Covenant.

23:45.891 --> 23:48.660
But with the help
of the Cortana system...

23:50.495 --> 23:52.164
we can win this war.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.633
[Penma]
Didn't you author a paper

23:54.699 --> 23:57.169
about a hypothetical artificial
general intelligence

23:57.235 --> 23:59.771
that could interface
directly with humans?

24:01.006 --> 24:02.841
Yes, I authored several.

24:02.908 --> 24:06.211
And didn't that process depend
on biological substrates?

24:06.278 --> 24:07.746
Derived from
the illegal practice

24:07.813 --> 24:09.614
of flash-cloning humans?

24:11.783 --> 24:13.919
That's correct.

24:13.985 --> 24:15.687
Have you found a way
around that?

24:17.923 --> 24:21.059
Admiral Parangosky,

24:21.126 --> 24:23.762
Section Three
is your responsibility.

24:23.829 --> 24:27.599
Any advantage we can get
on the Covenant is a good thing.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.100
But just so we're clear,

24:29.167 --> 24:31.536
you're on board
with Halsey's program?

24:35.106 --> 24:38.643
I think the case of Master Chief
provides an opportunity

24:38.710 --> 24:42.747
for a limited trial
of the system, yes.

24:42.814 --> 24:43.949
[Hood] Good,
I'll leave it to you

24:44.015 --> 24:46.151
to manage
the technical hurdles.

24:48.620 --> 24:52.490
Let's get Master Chief back
and put this mess behind us.

24:52.557 --> 24:54.125
We have a war to win.

25:17.883 --> 25:21.253
Remember the tale
of the rebel Jin.

25:24.222 --> 25:27.559
And what a spot
he put Madrigal in.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.698
Led us into costly war.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.003
Oh.

25:38.069 --> 25:42.741
And then he stole our hydrogen.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.611
[aircraft warbling overhead]

25:55.086 --> 25:58.256
[indistinct radio chatter]

26:06.865 --> 26:08.833
Vinsher hated my father.

26:10.969 --> 26:14.072
He was always looking a way
to cut a deal with the UNSC.

26:17.342 --> 26:19.210
Now Madrigal is his.

26:20.946 --> 26:22.147
I'm so sorry.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.350
I know how you feel.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.685
Do you?

26:26.751 --> 26:28.186
I lost my whole family

26:28.253 --> 26:30.755
when I was just a little
younger than you are now.

26:32.057 --> 26:34.759
I lost my whole planet
to the Covenant.

26:34.826 --> 26:37.095
Everyone I love,
until I met Soren.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.867
You want revenge.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.006
I want justice.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.710
Revenge and justice
are easy to confuse.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.719
Go ahead, taste it.

27:07.692 --> 27:09.294
I don't taste anything.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.696
You stick around here
long enough, you will.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.231
That's freedom, man.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.668
How big a jump did you get
on the UNSC?

27:17.769 --> 27:19.004
Not big enough.

27:19.070 --> 27:20.205
I give them a day.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.808
More than you gave me.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.010
Yep.

27:25.076 --> 27:26.211
[grunts]

27:26.277 --> 27:27.412
Mm-mm.

27:30.181 --> 27:31.850
I don't get it, John.

27:31.916 --> 27:33.818
Get what?

27:33.885 --> 27:35.086
This.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.155
You.

27:37.222 --> 27:38.923
Showing up here,
on the run from your people,

27:38.990 --> 27:41.226
carrying a fugitive.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.728
I mean, who are you?

27:45.163 --> 27:47.032
I'm trying to figure
a few things out.

27:47.098 --> 27:49.134
Like what's in that box?

27:51.469 --> 27:52.904
There you are.

27:52.971 --> 27:54.305
-Sorry.
-Mmm, mmm, mmm.

27:54.372 --> 27:56.341
We were just getting to know
each other.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.809
Us too.

27:57.876 --> 27:59.978
[child shouts, giggles]

28:00.845 --> 28:02.414
[grunts]

28:02.480 --> 28:04.849
I can name all the planets
in the sky.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.051
Can you?

28:06.117 --> 28:08.720
[Kessler]
Maybe not all.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.989
[Soren]
Who'd have thought it?

28:11.056 --> 28:14.259
Me... wife... a kid.

28:14.325 --> 28:16.761
[Kessler] If you want,
I could show you them.

28:16.828 --> 28:18.196
I thought
it was impossible.

28:18.263 --> 28:19.731
[Soren inhaling]

28:19.798 --> 28:21.266
I thought the treatments
they gave us--

28:21.332 --> 28:22.467
Treatments?

28:22.534 --> 28:24.102
[laughs]

28:25.470 --> 28:27.305
He's still calling them
treatments.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.374
Maybe he still believes it.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.378
-[Kwan] What is it?
-Clarity.

28:33.445 --> 28:37.082
I think I've had enough clarity
for one day, thanks.

28:37.148 --> 28:38.917
[Soren] There's something
you need to know

28:38.983 --> 28:43.088
about the Spartan program
and all those treatments, John.

28:43.154 --> 28:44.889
What they did to us,
it's only permanent

28:44.956 --> 28:46.357
if we choose to let it be.

28:46.424 --> 28:48.893
Doesn't matter how long
it had you.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.930
For example,
that pellet you got in your back

28:51.996 --> 28:54.232
that enhances battle focus?

28:54.299 --> 28:55.834
It mutes everything.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.068
It eliminates distraction.

28:57.135 --> 28:59.304
It makes you numb.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.972
It makes you as numb to life

29:01.039 --> 29:04.342
as you are to the taste
of this food.

29:06.177 --> 29:07.745
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

29:07.812 --> 29:09.180
-[chuckles]
-[Soren] Mmm.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.915
John...

29:10.982 --> 29:12.750
lose the pellet

29:12.817 --> 29:16.287
and it's like opening your eyes
for the first time

29:16.354 --> 29:17.522
after living in the dark.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.892
Soren, leave John be.

29:20.959 --> 29:23.495
He has a lot on his mind.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.432
-I got you.
-Pew, pew! No, you don't.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.334
[Laera] It means a lot to
Soren that you've come,

29:29.400 --> 29:31.870
though I get a sense
that you won't be staying.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.438
-[Kessler laughs]
-Like you said,

29:33.505 --> 29:34.372
I have a lot on my mind.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.507
[Laera]
Yes.

29:35.573 --> 29:37.342
[gasps]
Kessler.

29:38.476 --> 29:39.944
What's this?

29:40.011 --> 29:41.913
[Laera]
It's, um...

29:41.980 --> 29:44.315
It's his sign.

29:44.382 --> 29:45.316
[Soren]
You should be honored, man.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.018
It means he can count on you

29:47.085 --> 29:48.453
and you can count on him.

30:00.064 --> 30:01.799
Thank you, Kessler.

30:01.866 --> 30:03.334
I accept.

30:03.401 --> 30:05.570
[Soren]
"Thank you, Kessler. I accept."

30:05.637 --> 30:07.005
[Soren laughs]

30:07.071 --> 30:08.406
Man, you are a stiff one,
Johnny.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.874
Okay.

30:09.941 --> 30:11.109
Sweet dreams.

30:11.176 --> 30:12.911
Toodle-oo.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.245
Good night.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.114
[Soren]
I guess when a camel flies,

30:16.181 --> 30:18.983
you don't ask how far.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.985
-[Kessler] Good night.
-[Laera] Kessler, let's go.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.900
-[console beeping]
-Vannak. Riz.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.171
-Are you getting this?
-[Vannak] Yes.

30:40.238 --> 30:42.874
Sensor plot has the Condor
dropping out of slipspace

30:42.941 --> 30:44.108
inside an asteroid belt.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.844
It makes no sense.

30:46.911 --> 30:48.046
Stay on the track?

30:49.280 --> 30:50.481
Stay on it.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.431
-Admiral.
-What is it, Doctor?

31:06.497 --> 31:08.132
I'm already
not in the mood.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.901
I understand from my father
that Dr. Halsey

31:09.968 --> 31:12.170
is getting sole access
to the Madrigal object.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.339
If and when we find it.

31:14.405 --> 31:17.542
Ma'am, xeno-technology
is my department.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.077
I'm aware.

31:19.143 --> 31:21.512
If I recall, I put you
in that position.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.416
Dr. Halsey already takes
the lion's share of funding,

31:25.483 --> 31:27.485
and she's only focused
on her Spartans.

31:27.552 --> 31:30.154
All of our advances
in shielding, active camo,

31:30.221 --> 31:31.623
even slipspace navigation

31:31.689 --> 31:34.292
derived from my--
My research.

31:34.359 --> 31:35.994
I'm even making
great progress

31:36.060 --> 31:38.196
in understanding
the Sangheili language.

31:38.263 --> 31:40.898
Whatever this object is,
I'm the one to untangle it.

31:40.965 --> 31:44.936
I could make great strides
if I had you on my side.

31:46.271 --> 31:47.438
So much like your mother.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.541
Except you lack
the polish.

31:50.608 --> 31:52.143
-Ma'am, I--
-I've had enough

31:52.210 --> 31:53.945
of being manipulated
for the day.

31:54.012 --> 31:55.513
Get back to work,
Miranda.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.621
What is it?

32:03.688 --> 32:06.291
Some kind of Covenant artifact,
I think.

32:06.357 --> 32:07.492
What does it do?

32:09.260 --> 32:11.095
-I'm not sure.
-Bullshit.

32:11.162 --> 32:13.598
I can see you're lying
in your eyes.

32:13.665 --> 32:15.466
Now you didn't drag this thing
halfway across the galaxy

32:15.533 --> 32:16.968
because it's pretty.

32:17.035 --> 32:18.703
What does it do?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.338
It powered his ship.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.241
I saw it.

32:23.308 --> 32:25.243
Ship was dead, then he touched
this thing and bam.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.945
How?

32:28.012 --> 32:29.280
I don't know.

32:33.518 --> 32:34.652
[Soren chuckles]

32:34.719 --> 32:36.054
Don't!

32:38.489 --> 32:40.158
It worked for him.

32:44.095 --> 32:45.263
I know a guy.

32:45.330 --> 32:46.464
No.

32:48.166 --> 32:49.434
Not interested
in selling it.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.302
Guy's name is Reth.

32:51.369 --> 32:54.272
He got taken into a Covenant
ship and lived to talk about it.

32:54.339 --> 32:56.341
He's seen things.

32:57.675 --> 32:59.610
He knows things.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.312
Trust me, man.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.419
Where can I find him?

33:14.559 --> 33:16.661
-[indistinct chatter]
-[horn honking]

33:19.664 --> 33:22.533
This is the safest place
in the galaxy you could find?

33:22.600 --> 33:23.735
Weren't a lot
of options.

33:23.801 --> 33:25.203
Rubble is a haven
for people

33:25.269 --> 33:26.170
who don't fit in
anywhere else.

33:26.237 --> 33:28.172
Like you?

33:28.239 --> 33:31.442
[Soren] I'm talking about a
whole other deal, man. Mystics.

33:31.509 --> 33:35.046
Guys like Reth are swimming
in the cosmic river.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.048
Got any good churros today?

33:37.115 --> 33:38.316
Yes, it's hot.

33:38.383 --> 33:40.051
All right,
give me half a dozen.

33:40.118 --> 33:41.452
[steam hissing]

33:44.088 --> 33:46.324
-So he's insane.
-He's sensitive.

33:46.391 --> 33:48.793
Hanging out with the aliens
will change you, brother.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.762
[Soren]
Looks like a jail, but it's not.

33:50.828 --> 33:53.398
It's a refuge for him.

33:53.464 --> 33:55.266
One last thing.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.503
No sudden moves.

34:02.607 --> 34:03.741
[laughs]
I'm just kidding.

34:04.842 --> 34:06.411
Man, lighten up.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.825
Oh, look who it is.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.260
[man]
What's the man's name?

34:22.326 --> 34:24.295
Who's the man? What's his name?

34:24.362 --> 34:27.732
Mr. Selfish.
Mr. Selfish. Mr. Selfish.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.600
Who you calling selfish?
I brought churros.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.102
Spartan.

34:33.571 --> 34:34.705
[growls]

34:37.341 --> 34:38.509
[man]
I can smell them.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.453
They like sweets.

34:50.388 --> 34:51.689
Hey...

34:51.756 --> 34:53.090
Don't worry.

34:54.158 --> 34:55.293
They won't bite you.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.378
[woman shouting distantly]

35:17.682 --> 35:18.816
Hey!

35:20.751 --> 35:22.119
[Soren]
Reth.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.888
It's me, Soren.
You there?

35:25.957 --> 35:28.726
Yeah. Are you?

35:31.462 --> 35:32.730
I brought some friends
with me.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.131
I'm coming in, okay?

35:35.600 --> 35:36.734
[Reth]
Close it!

35:36.801 --> 35:38.402
Close it, close it, close it!

35:47.912 --> 35:49.247
Who's he?

35:49.313 --> 35:50.448
[Soren]
Reth, this is John.

35:50.515 --> 35:52.917
This is Reth.

35:54.619 --> 35:56.687
You've seen them too?

35:56.754 --> 35:58.456
The Covenant?

35:58.523 --> 35:59.757
Yes.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.292
[Reth]
And you fought?

36:02.660 --> 36:04.161
And you won?

36:05.329 --> 36:06.731
Not yet.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.900
[Soren]
John's being modest.

36:08.966 --> 36:11.602
He's a regular Covenant
killing machine.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.170
What'd make him better

36:13.237 --> 36:14.939
is a little bit
of inside information.

36:16.574 --> 36:17.875
Come here.

36:28.452 --> 36:29.453
What's your name?

36:31.455 --> 36:32.790
Kwan.

36:34.325 --> 36:35.960
-Kwan Ha.
-[Reth] Oh, yes, you are.

36:37.361 --> 36:38.596
Kwan Ha.

36:38.663 --> 36:40.231
-Hello? Reth.
-Kwan Ha.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.301
Over here, man.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.736
[laughs]
Hi.

36:45.803 --> 36:47.939
John's got a little something
he wants to show you.

36:57.648 --> 36:59.250
Kwan Ha...

36:59.317 --> 37:00.484
Hey.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.259
[grunts]

37:08.326 --> 37:09.527
Where did you get this?

37:09.594 --> 37:10.828
[John]
On Madrigal.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.997
Covenant detachment
was excavating it.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.599
[Reth]
Madrigal. Poor Madrigal.

37:14.665 --> 37:16.334
You know Madrigal?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.269
Any place that has been
visited by the Covenant

37:18.336 --> 37:20.004
has my sympathies.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.307
Covenant's whole religion
is based on things like this.

37:23.374 --> 37:25.977
Things from another time,
things left behind.

37:26.043 --> 37:28.412
They roam the galaxy looking
for pieces, looking for clues.

37:28.479 --> 37:30.247
Do you understand?

37:31.449 --> 37:33.517
When I was a guest
on their ship,

37:33.584 --> 37:35.686
they asked to see
if I could make them work,

37:35.753 --> 37:38.823
but I could not,
sensitive as I am.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.340
[gasps]

37:56.407 --> 37:58.509
[laughs]

38:00.745 --> 38:01.879
See?

38:03.781 --> 38:05.850
I'm not a Blessed One.

38:05.916 --> 38:09.453
-What's a Blessed One?
-[Reth] Human, only more so.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.555
But what are humans?
Homo sapiens?

38:11.622 --> 38:13.891
An accidental collision
of amino acids.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.860
But is that enough?
Is that all there is?

38:15.926 --> 38:18.062
Being human?
Well, for you, perhaps,

38:18.129 --> 38:20.698
but a Blessed One
has an obligation.

38:20.765 --> 38:22.500
No, not an obligation...

38:22.566 --> 38:23.834
-We're losing' him.
-...a responsibility...

38:23.901 --> 38:26.804
[Reth]
...no, a-a-a moral imperative.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.305
-Or an aperitif.
-Hey.

38:28.372 --> 38:29.607
I always had a nice,
cold glass of--

38:29.674 --> 38:31.442
Reth!

38:31.509 --> 38:32.877
What is this thing?

38:34.445 --> 38:35.813
What does it do?

38:37.648 --> 38:42.887
You don't want to help
the Covenant destroy us, do you?

38:44.121 --> 38:45.923
No.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.324
[gasps]

38:56.967 --> 38:58.102
Good!

38:58.169 --> 38:59.904
[screams]

39:01.105 --> 39:02.707
[all screaming]

39:08.746 --> 39:10.748
[electricity crackling]

39:12.883 --> 39:14.752
[John's mother]
Let's hang this one.

39:14.819 --> 39:16.587
[Young John]
No!

39:18.556 --> 39:20.024
I don't want to do it!

39:23.994 --> 39:25.062
John!

39:25.129 --> 39:29.133
[all screaming]

39:29.200 --> 39:30.835
[crying]

39:33.170 --> 39:35.439
[panting]

39:35.506 --> 39:37.808
What are you?

39:40.544 --> 39:42.880
You bring it to life.

39:44.515 --> 39:48.652
But you are different
than the one they have!

39:48.719 --> 39:50.554
-[screams]
-Easy.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.156
-The one they have?
-[Reth] It's in your eyes.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.691
What do you mean?

39:53.758 --> 39:54.892
-Easy.
-It's in your eyes!

39:54.959 --> 39:55.826
What do you mean?

39:55.893 --> 39:56.727
You don't understand

39:56.794 --> 39:58.562
what you are, do you?

39:58.629 --> 40:00.731
What am I?

40:00.798 --> 40:02.099
[laughs]

40:04.568 --> 40:06.403
[yells]
What am I?!

40:06.470 --> 40:08.105
[panting]

40:08.172 --> 40:10.674
The image you made it produce,
the ring,

40:10.741 --> 40:12.176
that's what they want!

40:12.243 --> 40:13.711
[sobs]

40:13.778 --> 40:15.546
-What is that ring?
-[Reth] A door.

40:16.614 --> 40:17.748
To what?

40:18.916 --> 40:23.420
The end of life as we know it.

40:26.223 --> 40:27.591
So it's a weapon?

40:29.126 --> 40:30.528
Yeah.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.135
You felt it, didn't you?

40:39.870 --> 40:41.005
The darkness.

40:42.973 --> 40:44.108
Yes.

40:45.643 --> 40:47.812
That means
you can stop it.

40:48.879 --> 40:50.548
How?

40:53.684 --> 40:55.186
Destroy the artifact.

40:57.221 --> 40:59.056
Then destroy yourself.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.233
John. Hey.

41:10.601 --> 41:11.969
John!

41:16.907 --> 41:18.108
[gasps softly]

41:18.175 --> 41:19.543
[Soren]
John, hold up.

41:19.610 --> 41:20.811
I have to go back.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.947
[Kwan]
To the UNSC? Why?

41:23.013 --> 41:24.949
They turned my planet over
to a warlord.

41:25.015 --> 41:26.650
They ordered you to kill me.

41:26.717 --> 41:28.652
Hey, John, look, we can figure
this shit out here.

41:28.719 --> 41:30.721
No, I need
the other Spartans.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.623
You need them,
not me.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.158
I don't expect you
to understand.

41:34.225 --> 41:37.027
Oh, I understand completely.
You need to get back to her.

41:37.094 --> 41:39.663
Yeah, you're running
back to Halsey.

41:39.730 --> 41:42.833
Any time there's a problem,
Mommy's there to fix it.

41:42.900 --> 41:46.003
You think she cares about you?
Huh? You're just a machine.

41:46.070 --> 41:48.072
And you're a coward who ran away
when things got hard.

41:48.138 --> 41:49.540
Oh, okay.

41:49.607 --> 41:50.741
You have no loyalty
to anything.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.109
You want to talk to me
about loyalty?

41:52.176 --> 41:54.645
You gave me
five goddamn minutes.

41:54.712 --> 41:57.047
You want to know
what that bought me?

41:57.114 --> 41:58.682
They shot me down.
I was burned all to hell,

41:58.749 --> 42:00.150
living off bark and beetles.

42:00.217 --> 42:03.854
They were on my ass for
months till I got free.

42:03.921 --> 42:06.056
All because you gave me
five minutes.

42:06.123 --> 42:08.025
You were wrong to run.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.895
You were wrong to stay!

42:10.961 --> 42:12.129
[Kwan]
Master Chief, wait!

42:13.797 --> 42:15.766
I've seen what Covenant
weapons are capable of.

42:15.833 --> 42:17.735
Entire planets
turned to glass.

42:17.801 --> 42:19.803
So if they're going after
something bigger,

42:19.870 --> 42:21.639
I have no choice.

42:23.807 --> 42:25.175
And I need you
to keep her here.

42:25.242 --> 42:26.877
-What?
-Soren...

42:26.944 --> 42:30.014
you're the only person
I know outside the UNSC.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.683
I need to trust you
right now.

42:32.750 --> 42:34.184
Can I trust you?

42:34.251 --> 42:36.887
-Of course you can trust--
-Then keep her safe.

42:40.090 --> 42:41.892
-John--
-Promise me.

42:44.261 --> 42:46.230
I give you my word.

42:47.698 --> 42:49.300
Wait, hold on.

42:49.366 --> 42:52.102
Don't I get a say in this?

42:52.169 --> 42:55.072
You can't just leave me here.

42:56.206 --> 42:57.741
I'm sorry, Kwan.

42:57.808 --> 42:59.310
This is the best I could do.

43:08.686 --> 43:10.220
So that's it?

43:38.682 --> 43:40.084
[door seals closed]

43:48.726 --> 43:50.127
[engine powering up]

43:56.133 --> 43:58.102
[beeping]

43:58.168 --> 44:00.304
[engine revs]

44:44.982 --> 44:46.116
[beeping]

44:49.319 --> 44:51.688
[Kai]
Fleetcom, this is Stalwart Dawn.

44:51.755 --> 44:53.891
One-One-Seven has activated
his beacon.

44:55.059 --> 44:57.127
Very well.

44:57.194 --> 44:58.295
Bring him in.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.874
[tech] Stalwart Dawn has entered
Reach airspace.

45:10.941 --> 45:14.011
Initiating ground transfer
of Master Chief and Silver Team.

45:47.978 --> 45:48.812
[Halsey]
Stop here.

45:54.885 --> 45:56.086
Handle it carefully.

46:13.337 --> 46:15.038
Put it in with me.

47:26.043 --> 47:27.044
Well?

47:29.980 --> 47:32.249
I've never seen
anything like it.

47:32.316 --> 47:34.084
Did you tell them that
the Covenant wants this too?

47:34.151 --> 47:35.586
That it might be
some kind of weapon?

47:35.652 --> 47:37.321
-Yes, I did.
-And?

47:37.387 --> 47:40.390
And if it points
to something greater,

47:40.457 --> 47:42.960
of course we'll explore
that possibility.

47:43.026 --> 47:47.297
But, John, your actions
have created a host of problems,

47:47.364 --> 47:49.333
not just for you, but for
the whole Spartan program

47:49.399 --> 47:51.568
and for me personally.

47:51.635 --> 47:53.203
[sighs]

47:53.270 --> 47:57.874
The people rely on you
to protect them,

47:57.941 --> 47:59.343
to make them feel safe.

47:59.409 --> 48:02.479
It is precisely
your dependability

48:02.546 --> 48:04.548
that gives people hope.

48:04.615 --> 48:09.186
How am I supposed to defend
your reckless behavior?

48:13.090 --> 48:14.591
I felt something.

48:18.495 --> 48:20.497
I believe you.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.299
I've been going
over and over in my head...

48:24.968 --> 48:26.303
all the details of the images

48:26.370 --> 48:27.938
that I see when
I touch the object.

48:28.005 --> 48:29.673
I don't know.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.908
I don't think that's a
constructive place for us to go.

48:31.975 --> 48:34.011
I think we should focus
on the lab results.

48:42.519 --> 48:46.590
What was it about the girl
that made you run?

48:51.194 --> 48:53.063
[Vinsher, over monitor]
Madrigal has a gift.

48:53.130 --> 48:55.666
It runs through our rivers,
in our lakes,

48:55.732 --> 48:57.367
and the ground
on which we live.

48:57.434 --> 49:02.005
And with our partners
in the UNSC,

49:02.072 --> 49:05.642
we will return to our place

49:05.709 --> 49:08.178
as the gem
of the outer colonies.

49:10.347 --> 49:12.716
[John]
I couldn't let her die.

49:12.783 --> 49:15.485
[Halsey] But you've seen
so many people die.

49:15.552 --> 49:18.355
Why was this situation
any different?

49:28.398 --> 49:30.300
[John] Well I don't think
the situation was different.

49:30.367 --> 49:31.501
I think...

49:32.602 --> 49:33.737
I am...

49:35.339 --> 49:36.473
different.

49:42.212 --> 49:45.148
I feel connected to something.

49:52.389 --> 49:56.193
I don't know what it is
or why it chose me.

50:00.530 --> 50:02.265
But I know it's out there.

50:07.738 --> 50:09.272
I can feel it.

[Halsey]
Have you felt this way before?

50:19.783 --> 50:21.718
I don't usually feel anything.

50:26.523 --> 50:29.025
Then why did you come back?

50:41.505 --> 50:43.540
There's no one else
I could trust.

50:46.777 --> 50:48.412
Thank you.

50:51.548 --> 50:53.450
You made the right choice.

51:07.297 --> 51:09.466
I see this as a new beginning.

51:17.674 --> 51:19.443

51:25.415 --> 51:29.386
[Halsey] We're going to
do great things together.
