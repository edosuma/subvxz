00:11.761 --> 00:13.304
Look at this creepy DM I got.

00:13.388 --> 00:16.766
It's from a fake account, and it says
Paxton isn't who I think he is.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.310
<i>Devi had spent the last 13 hours</i>

00:19.394 --> 00:22.439
<i>obsessing about this DM</i>
<i>and assuming the worst,</i>

00:22.522 --> 00:23.982
<i>but Eleanor knew better.</i>

00:24.065 --> 00:26.443
Devi has a troll, which is thrilling.

00:26.526 --> 00:32.032
Your social status has skyrocketed so much
that now people hate you. Congrats.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.116
Thank you?

00:33.199 --> 00:34.617
Take a gander.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.704
You got jealous bitches
in surround sound, henny.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.789
<i>Devi hoped Eleanor was right.</i>

00:39.873 --> 00:43.293
<i>Not only because it was fun</i>
<i>to have people be jealous of her,</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:45.628
<i>but because she didn't want anything</i>
<i>to ruin the dream</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:47.714
<i>of her finally dating Paxton.</i>

00:47.797 --> 00:48.798
That's a good point, El.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.134
It's gotta be a troll. I'm writing back.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.344
Think I know my boyfriend better than you.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.263
Hit the bricks, hater! Huh?

00:55.346 --> 00:59.017
Devi, you used to make
that face all the time.

01:00.643 --> 01:03.855
I know! And now my face is so relaxed!

01:03.938 --> 01:07.525
Oh my God,
that's why popular people age better.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.777
Exactly!

01:08.860 --> 01:12.280
Access to constant kissing
is like nature's Botox.

01:12.363 --> 01:15.533
So we're all gonna be
baby-faced bitches forever.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.286
Oh shit, Fab. Forgot about you and Eve.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.580
It's fine. Don't even worry about it.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.499
I'm sure I'll find love again.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.876
Probably with a nice woman
from grad school.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.586
She already sounds amazing.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.129
And I'm sorry.

01:28.797 --> 01:29.714
Thanks, guys.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.883
-Oh. The DMer wrote back!

01:32.425 --> 01:35.845
They say, "I'm not a hater,
and I definitely know Paxton."

01:35.929 --> 01:37.764
"I actually used to be you."

01:37.847 --> 01:38.973
Whoa.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.476
<i> What the hell did that mean?</i>

01:50.693 --> 01:54.030
<i>Devi knew Paxton</i>
<i>had hooked up with lots of girls before.</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:54.948
<i>Obviously.</i>

01:55.031 --> 01:58.076
<i>The kid looks like he was born</i>
<i>to walk slowly out of the ocean</i>

01:58.159 --> 01:59.160
<i>in a cologne ad.</i>

01:59.953 --> 02:03.331
<i>But what did the DMer mean</i>
<i>when they said they used to be her?</i>

02:03.414 --> 02:06.084
-What you doing?
-Uh, nothing! Just Googling.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.002
Wait.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.589
"Paxton Hall-Yoshida
is not who you think he…"

02:12.382 --> 02:13.675
What is this?

02:13.758 --> 02:16.594
Someone sent me some random DMs.
Eleanor thinks it's a troll.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.471
So, why are you writing back to 'em?

02:18.555 --> 02:21.641
You have to admit. It's kind of hard not
to respond when someone sends that.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.143
No, it's not.

02:23.226 --> 02:26.646
I mean, whenever people send me rude DMs
about you, I just delete them.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.898
Uh-- How many DMs are we--

02:28.982 --> 02:31.526
<i> Leave it, Devi.</i>
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

02:31.609 --> 02:33.236
You're right. You're totally right.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.156
I'm not gonna write to them anymore.
I don't even know why I engaged.

02:36.239 --> 02:39.534
-Guess I'm just gullible.
-Nah, trolls just suck.

02:39.617 --> 02:40.535
Yeah.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.329
But also, this one is right

02:44.080 --> 02:46.207
because I'm not who you think I am.

02:49.043 --> 02:49.878
I'm Batman.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.630
-All right, very hilarious.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.716
I'm loving
your dorky uncle jokes.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.593
Where my sports fans at?

02:57.635 --> 02:59.888
M'kay. Where my friends at?

02:59.971 --> 03:01.222
Yay. That's us.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.017
So, you guys want
to come cheer me on on Thursday?

03:04.100 --> 03:06.436
The girls' soccer team made it
to the district championships.

03:06.519 --> 03:10.440
Whoa, that's so cool! We haven't made it
to a championship since the '80s.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.526
And that's only because
the coach put cocaine in the team's water.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.112
Whoa. Anyway, you guys in?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.280
Ugh. I can't.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.908
Ironically,
I'll be at a rival soccer event,

03:19.991 --> 03:22.118
rehearsal for the spring production
of<i> Ted Lasso.</i>

03:22.202 --> 03:24.454
Oy, I'm Keeley, innit?

03:24.537 --> 03:25.747
Dang.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.166
Well, I'll be there,
and I can cheer for both of us.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.835
If I bring my robot
that's recorded Eleanor's voice.

03:30.919 --> 03:31.753
I'm excited.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.254
-Excited for what?

03:33.338 --> 03:34.631
My championship on Thursday.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.965
I told you about it.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.342
Wait, this Thursday?

03:37.842 --> 03:39.510
Babe, I don't know if I can come.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.387
We have a huge chem test on Friday.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.306
And with all the extra credit
I've been doing,

03:43.389 --> 03:44.641
I haven't even started studying.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.559
Oh. Yeah, of course. It's okay.

03:46.643 --> 03:47.894
I'm so sorry.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.604
I know that I suck for not going.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.272
I'm just really stressed out.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.234
-But I promise I'll make it up to you.
-It's not a big deal at all.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.611
This is only the districts, not state.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.738
Oh, well, if you go to state,
I'm there for sure.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.032
I can cobble together a third robot
for Thursday.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.577
Don't worry,
your cheering section will be lit.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.789
And also lit
because of the lights on the robots.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.800
Your hands
are bony and cold. Stop!

04:18.883 --> 04:19.717
Hello!

04:19.801 --> 04:24.097
I'm home, despite almost being killed
by someone with a YOLO bumper sticker.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.723
-How was your day?
-Oh, lovely.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.685
Just spent it at the house alone.
No one to bother me.

04:28.768 --> 04:32.105
-I was here the whole day.
-Boy, do I love me some me time.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.483
Kamala, why don't you take
some me time upstairs?

04:38.069 --> 04:39.237
Okay.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.448
Now, as a doctor, I'm obligated to ask.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.202
Is this a passive-aggressive situation
or a dementia situation?

04:46.286 --> 04:49.080
How dare you, Nalu.
I have the brain of a young Zuckerberg.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.042
Nirmala <i>Mami,</i> you can't give Kamala
the silent treatment forever.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.337
We all have to live in this house,
and it's kind of getting uncomfortable.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.381
What Kamala did is unforgivable.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.092
I can't even show my face
at the Malibu temple anymore.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.177
Because you took money
from the offering plate.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.555
Only two dollars. I needed it for parking.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.850
You have to find a way
to make up with Kamala. Okay?

05:08.933 --> 05:11.227
She's not marrying Prashant.
We need to accept that.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.063
We also need to get you a debit card
to pay for parking.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.816
She doesn't understand
what she's thrown away.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.319
It's easy to be independent at her age,

05:19.402 --> 05:21.821
but she doesn't know
how lonely one can be.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.283
You get it, Nalini.
You have no husband or friends.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.994
Wait, what? I have friends.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.245
No, you don't.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.413
I have friends.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.914
I have my temple clique,

05:31.998 --> 05:34.375
my mall-walking clique,
my neighborhood watch clique.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.127
What about my nurse Tracey?

05:36.210 --> 05:38.129
Tracey is your employee.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.298
And she even didn't invite you
for her birthday party.

05:40.381 --> 05:43.676
Oh, that's because she knows I'm not going
to anything that starts at00.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.386
I mean, hold on.
This is not even about me.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.596
This is about you and Kamala.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.557
Can you please find a way
to forgive her so we can all move on?

05:51.934 --> 05:53.895
Devi, I can't take it anymore.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.146
Let's text your DMer.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.149
No, you said it yourself.
It's just a troll.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.776
Well, maybe I was wrong.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.236
It doesn't matter
because I already told Paxton

06:02.320 --> 06:03.363
I won't engage with them.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.199
Of course, Paxton doesn't want you
to talk to the DMer.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.284
I mean, Jeffrey Dahmer
didn't want the police

06:08.368 --> 06:09.994
to look in his refrigerator either.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.621
What was in his refrigerator?

06:11.704 --> 06:12.955
His lover's head.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.208
I can see Paxton having a fridge head.

06:17.126 --> 06:19.087
What? A lot of serial killers
are good-looking.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.171
Enough!

06:20.254 --> 06:23.383
Paxton does not have a fridge head,
and I don't care about the troll!

06:23.466 --> 06:24.842
Mmm… What troll?

06:24.926 --> 06:28.554
Devi has a troll
that says Paxton isn't who he says he is

06:28.638 --> 06:30.014
and that they used to be Devi.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.349
Here, take a look.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.267
How are you signed into my Instagram?

06:33.351 --> 06:37.688
You told us that your password
to everything is Paxton69!,

06:37.772 --> 06:39.941
so I sign in
when you forget to like my post.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.526
-Eleanor!
-Mmm.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.404
How could you resist figuring out
who this is? You're naturally curious.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.656
I know, but I promised Paxton.

06:47.156 --> 06:50.451
Oh. I didn't promise him anything.
We need to send the DMer another message.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.037
No! And why are you a part of this now?

06:53.121 --> 06:56.582
Ooh, we're gonna solve a mystery?
I'm gonna get us snacks.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.584
Mmm.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.837
Okay, so what should we type back?

07:00.920 --> 07:03.548
Oh, how about, "Reveal yourself, coward."

07:03.631 --> 07:06.050
All right. If we're gonna do this,
we're doing this my way.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.010
Let's try,

07:08.719 --> 07:11.097
"At least tell me how you were like me?"

07:11.180 --> 07:12.682
Ooh, that's good, David.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.560
Oh. They're replying back.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.147
They say, "We're both good girls
who got involved with Paxton

07:19.230 --> 07:21.357
because we assumed he was perfect."

07:21.441 --> 07:23.317
"I had loved him since grade school too."

07:23.901 --> 07:25.486
Boom. She outed herself.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.446
How?

07:26.529 --> 07:29.449
There are four elementary schools
that feed into two middle schools

07:29.532 --> 07:30.867
that feed into this high school.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.452
Paxton went to East Elementary.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.872
So all we have to do now is figure out
who he's been romantically linked with

07:35.955 --> 07:37.248
who also went to East with him.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.624
Who has that kind of intel?

07:40.084 --> 07:42.503
Oh, Eric, we need Lady Whistleboy's help.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.422
Who doesn't?

07:44.505 --> 07:47.383
But the identity of Lady Whistleboy
is one of the greatest mys--

07:47.467 --> 07:49.802
Shut up.
Everyone knows it's you. Sit down.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.304
Fine!

07:58.769 --> 08:00.188
-Hey!
-Hi.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.231
Uh, are you guys working on a project?

08:02.315 --> 08:05.526
Nah, we're just figuring out a mystery
in Devi's personal life. You want to join?

08:06.152 --> 08:08.821
No, I need to stretch before practice.

08:08.905 --> 08:12.241
Right! You got to make sure
your kicking leg's nice and limber.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.285
Okay, I don't know anything about sports,

08:14.368 --> 08:16.621
but I will Wikipedia soccer
before the big game.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.289
Thanks, Fab.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.878
-She's always going through my stuff.

08:23.961 --> 08:24.795
Mmm.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.591
<i>Hey, wanna come over tomorrow?</i>

08:28.674 --> 08:31.010
<i>I took your advice</i>
<i>and I got a little plant for my garage.</i>

08:31.093 --> 08:32.094
<i>I think it looks nice.</i>

08:32.178 --> 08:34.263
<i>Damn it. He's being really cute.</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:36.057
<i>Devi was feeling a little guilty</i>

08:36.140 --> 08:39.227
<i>for letting Ben talk her</i>
<i>into fraternizing with the enemy.</i>

08:40.311 --> 08:41.938
Feast your eyes.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.732
<i> Although,</i>
<i>using Lady Whistleboy's extensive</i>

08:44.857 --> 08:46.567
<i>and very creepy database,</i>

08:46.651 --> 08:50.655
<i>they had successfully narrowed down</i>
<i>the suspects to four people,</i>

08:50.738 --> 08:53.407
<i>head cheerleader, Jenny Smith,</i>

08:53.991 --> 08:56.702
<i>TikTok hair influencer, Taylor Yu,</i>

08:57.703 --> 09:01.040
<i>hottest person in orchestra, Haley Garcia,</i>

09:01.123 --> 09:05.419
<i>and of course, Zoe Maytag,</i>
<i>no introduction needed.</i>

09:06.087 --> 09:09.423
<i>She felt torn.</i>
<i>She didn't wanna be disloyal to Paxton,</i>

09:09.507 --> 09:13.344
<i>but damn, mystery girl</i>
<i>was getting interesting as hell.</i>

09:13.427 --> 09:15.471
-No phones at the table!
-No!

09:15.555 --> 09:17.431
Here you go, Kamala.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.851
You're speaking to me? You see me?

09:20.935 --> 09:24.897
I have given it a lot of thought,
and I found a way to forgive you.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.400
I'm throwing a mixer tomorrow night,

09:27.483 --> 09:29.443
so that you can get a new fiancé.

09:30.027 --> 09:30.945
What?

09:31.028 --> 09:31.862
Listen,

09:32.530 --> 09:33.573
I'm a modern woman.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.242
You have a Walkman clipped
to your belt right now.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.661
Exactly! Always plugged in.

09:39.161 --> 09:42.456
So I understand on some level, Kamala,

09:42.540 --> 09:45.167
you need to be happy
in your marital relationship.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.421
But if we can get you
a new fiancé really fast,

09:48.504 --> 09:52.091
whom you love, then no one back home
will even notice it's a different guy.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.969
That's quite a plan, <i>Mami.</i>

09:55.052 --> 09:56.012
I know!

09:56.095 --> 10:00.224
I've invited all the eligible grandsons
from my cool temple clique!

10:00.308 --> 10:04.395
And there will be index cards
with flirty icebreakers at the door.

10:07.898 --> 10:10.192
So, I've got intel. It's not Zoe.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.193
She doesn't DM.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.988
She always leaves her insults
in the comments section.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.781
-So that means that--
-Hey.

10:15.865 --> 10:19.243
The vending machine gave me
an extra Chips Ahoy, and I thought of you.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.245
-Oh.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.330
Gotta run.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.502
Phew! That was so close.
Anyway, Zoe's a no.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.254
Eleanor, forget it.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.590
Paxton just gave me
a free vending machine cookie.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.092
I know who he is, and he's a good person.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.428
I'm not gonna do this
behind his back anymore.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.848
What you're doing is shitty.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.184
Stop trying to ruin my relationship.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.228
All right. Well, I guess
I'll have to manufacture

10:46.312 --> 10:48.230
some other drama to entertain myself.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.108
Oh, the DMer wrote back.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.444
She says, "I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to help."

10:53.527 --> 10:55.029
"You've already gone through so much."

10:55.112 --> 10:59.283
"Losing a parent during Debussy
is enough heartache for one lifetime."

10:59.825 --> 11:01.535
Whoa, she mentioned your dad.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.996
-Yeah. How dare that bitch?

11:04.538 --> 11:07.875
I don't want your help. Leave me alo--

11:07.958 --> 11:11.420
<i>But before Devi could hit send,</i>
<i>she had an epiphany.</i>

11:11.504 --> 11:14.173
<i>Wait, did the DMer just say Debussy?</i>

11:14.256 --> 11:16.550
<i>That's what they played</i>
<i>at the spring concert,</i>

11:16.634 --> 11:19.220
<i>and no student</i>
<i>would be caught dead going to that,</i>

11:19.303 --> 11:22.640
<i>so that means she's in orchestra.</i>

11:37.071 --> 11:38.197
Hello, Haley.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.574
This is the closest location
I could find to a bridge.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.742
So start talking, troll.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.787
Devi, I'm sorry.
I really was trying to look out for you.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.330
You created a fake account,

11:46.414 --> 11:48.791
sent me creepy DMs
with no information in it

11:48.874 --> 11:50.042
to ruin my relationship.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.754
I know, I just… I didn't want you
to know who I was because honestly,

11:54.255 --> 11:55.631
I didn't wanna have to relive it.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.966
Relive what?

11:57.049 --> 11:59.301
Did Paxton kill your dog? Steal your car?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.470
Get specific.
You're not a friggin' horoscope.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.388
Fine.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.223
Basically,

12:05.015 --> 12:07.017
Paxton and I used to be best friends.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.812
<i>I've known his whole family</i>
<i>since fifth grade.</i>

12:10.312 --> 12:12.022
<i>I even went to church with them once</i>

12:12.106 --> 12:15.359
<i>where there was frankly a lot of talk</i>
<i>about how Jesus probably surfed.</i>

12:15.443 --> 12:18.237
<i>Anyways, last summer,</i>
<i>we were messing around</i>

12:18.320 --> 12:21.782
<i>and just started kissing,</i>
<i>which was awesome.</i>

12:21.866 --> 12:23.325
<i>And then we had sex,</i>

12:23.409 --> 12:25.995
<i>which was,</i>
<i>as I'm sure you know, incredible.</i>

12:26.078 --> 12:27.747
Yup, yup, yup. Get onto the bad stuff.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.958
Anyway, I thought that meant
we were gonna be something more,

12:31.542 --> 12:34.378
but then when I got to school
the next day, he iced me out.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.505
That's horrible.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.841
After that, I just hit rock bottom,

12:39.925 --> 12:41.093
which is when I joined orchestra.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.219
Makes sense.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.306
Listen, Haley,

12:46.390 --> 12:48.476
I'm really sorry Paxton did that to you.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.313
I get why you wanted to reach out
and why you went incognito.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.316
I'm also really sorry
I called you a troll.

12:55.399 --> 12:58.986
Maybe things will be different for you,
and I'll be happy if they are.

12:59.528 --> 13:04.074
But as a woman or a friend or whatever,
I just felt like you needed to know.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.580
<i>Devi's troll had turned out</i>
<i>to be an actual person</i>

13:09.663 --> 13:12.208
<i>who was actually hurt by her boyfriend.</i>

13:12.291 --> 13:15.002
<i>She wasn't quite sure</i>
<i>what to do with this information.</i>

13:15.085 --> 13:17.296
Vishwakumar.
Hey, I just wanted you to know

13:17.379 --> 13:20.049
that I think it would be
very unprofessional of me

13:20.132 --> 13:21.801
to use my position as your teacher

13:21.884 --> 13:24.470
to try and get information
from you about your cousin.

13:24.553 --> 13:25.387
Okay.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.389
Which is why I'm not gonna mention
how weird it is

13:27.473 --> 13:29.016
that she hasn't texted me back

13:29.099 --> 13:31.977
after we did karaoke together
a few weeks ago.

13:32.061 --> 13:35.189
But don't worry. I will not be asking
if you might know what's going on there.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.106
Cool.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.484
But… But since it was you
who pulled me aside--

13:38.567 --> 13:40.277
Oh my God, Mr. K, have some dignity.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.240
Fine.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.867
Kamala called things off
with her almost fiancé.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.161
And now my grandmother
is throwing her a mixer tonight

13:49.245 --> 13:50.412
to find her a new one.

13:51.288 --> 13:54.208
-Interesting. Um, what time we talking?
-Seven.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.961
Okay. Thank you, Miss Vishwakumar.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.630
Really great impromptu chat about Tolstoy!

14:03.300 --> 14:04.426
Hey.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.888
Oh. What's going on?

14:08.973 --> 14:11.267
-Do you still have feelings for Devi?
-What?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.019
I saw you hanging out with her yesterday.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.439
You say you have too much studying to do
to come to my championship game,

14:17.523 --> 14:20.234
but you seem to have loads of time
to dick around with her.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.403
What… That's not what happened.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.154
You know how Devi is.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.448
Her problems
just sort of suck everybody in.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.410
She's like if one of those <i>Dune </i>worms
had a flowery backpack

14:29.493 --> 14:30.828
and an annoying voice.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.875
-Do you know what my backpack looks like?
-It's yellow.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.212
That's correct.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.840
Look, you don't have to worry about Devi.

14:42.923 --> 14:43.841
Hey, I promise.

14:44.508 --> 14:48.137
-I just want to know that you're in this.
-Yeah. I definitely am!

14:48.220 --> 14:52.016
And of course I'll be at your game later.
I don't know what I was thinking.

14:52.099 --> 14:56.687
I'm gonna do all my studying tonight,
so that I can focus on this chemistry.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.023
Ah, that stinks and I hated that,

14:59.648 --> 15:00.524
but…

15:02.568 --> 15:03.986
I guess you're forgiven.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.078
Hey, everyone. Look!

15:13.162 --> 15:15.664
I bought us expensive juices!

15:15.748 --> 15:16.749
Thank you, Geeta.

15:16.832 --> 15:19.710
But no slurping.
I need to hear all the flirting.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.670
And do you have any hobbies?

15:21.754 --> 15:24.632
I find that you don't need hobbies
if you love what you do for work.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.509
-Oh, great. And what do you do?
-Mostly autopsies.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.055
Excuse me for just a second.

15:31.138 --> 15:34.099
Oh, no, no, Kamala, I've got it.
Please stay with your new friends.

15:34.683 --> 15:35.517
Okay, great.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.437
No, I could bring you
to the morgue one weekend.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.775
Hi, I'm Rhyah.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.527
My mother-in-law said
she was invited to a party here.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.073
Uh, yes, welcome. I'm Nalini,
and Nirmala is my mother-in-law.

15:49.156 --> 15:52.451
She just went to the eye doctor.
I tried to let her out at the curb,

15:52.534 --> 15:55.120
but she started veering towards
your bushes, so…

15:55.204 --> 15:57.665
-Ah, hello, Rhyah!
-Hi, Nirmala Auntie!

15:57.748 --> 15:59.667
I see you've already met Nalini.

15:59.750 --> 16:04.171
She's a brilliant doctor
with many patients and zero friends.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.007
-I have friends.
-You two should chat.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.842
You are both in the medical field.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.137
-Oh. I'm a dermatologist. What do you do?
-I'm a nutritionist.

16:12.221 --> 16:15.182
And actually I don't consider myself
in the medical field.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.602
Especially now that they focus more
on profits than healing people.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.604
I prefer to exist in the wellness space.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.108
Mm-hmm. Good for you!
Could you excuse me for a second?

16:24.191 --> 16:26.443
-I got it! No one else get it!

16:29.905 --> 16:30.948
Manish!

16:32.533 --> 16:36.495
<i>Devi couldn't decide</i>
<i>whether or not to ask Paxton about Haley.</i>

16:36.578 --> 16:39.373
<i>On one hand,</i>
<i>she considered herself a feminist</i>

16:39.456 --> 16:41.291
<i>who would stand up for a sister in need.</i>

16:41.375 --> 16:44.461
<i>But on the other hand,</i>
<i>she also didn't want to end up</i>

16:44.545 --> 16:47.297
<i>in Paxton's Goodwill pile with old Haley.</i>

16:49.341 --> 16:51.218
<i>Looks like feminism was gonna win.</i>

16:51.301 --> 16:52.136
Hey.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.222
So I know I said I wouldn't,

16:55.305 --> 16:58.225
but I kind of kept talking to the troll.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.477
What? Why?

17:00.561 --> 17:04.273
Well, she actually turned out
not to be a troll and was in fact,

17:04.773 --> 17:05.899
Haley,

17:05.983 --> 17:08.193
who then told me
that you had sex with her,

17:08.277 --> 17:09.653
and then kind of blew her off.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.907
That's messed up
that she told you that.

17:13.991 --> 17:14.992
So, it's not true?

17:15.075 --> 17:15.909
No.

17:16.994 --> 17:22.416
Well, I mean, yeah, it's kind of true,
but I didn't do it to be mean.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.837
I panicked, and I didn't know how to deal,
so I just avoided her.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.630
Seemed easier that way.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.757
For you.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.592
But you really hurt her.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.469
You know
she joined orchestra because of you?

17:33.552 --> 17:35.471
People like her
aren't supposed to join orchestra.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.390
All right, I guess
I was kind of a dick back then,

17:38.474 --> 17:40.309
but I wouldn't do that to someone now.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.645
I believe you, but I think
you should apologize to her and--

17:43.729 --> 17:44.688
What?

17:44.772 --> 17:47.107
No. It's weird to bring it up again.

17:47.191 --> 17:51.278
And honestly, she owes me an apology
for trashing me to my girlfriend.

17:51.361 --> 17:55.365
-Paxton. Come on, you were awful to her.
-Devi. Drop it. I'm not apologizing.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.825
-You have to!
-No, I don't.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.577
Well, then I can't be with you!

18:04.875 --> 18:05.709
I--

18:07.920 --> 18:08.754
What?

18:09.338 --> 18:12.299
Damn, you got rid of
this Prince Eric-looking dude?

18:12.382 --> 18:15.052
I'd be furious too if I was your grandma.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.720
He's like CW beautiful.

18:17.304 --> 18:20.974
I know, but even that jawline
doesn't make me ready for marriage.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.309
I'm not ready, either.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.561
I got two roommates,
and we share one suit.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.356
And guess who got it tonight? Your boy!

18:28.690 --> 18:31.652
A lot of laughter
and open body language over here.

18:31.735 --> 18:35.322
Are you the architect,
the anesthesiologist, or the astronaut?

18:35.405 --> 18:37.658
None of the above. Um, I teach English.

18:37.741 --> 18:40.494
At a university? Uh, Stanford, perhaps?

18:40.577 --> 18:42.121
No, at Devi's high school.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.873
That rat hole? Whose grandson are you?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.167
I don't really know my grandparents.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.253
They are back in India,
and I've never visited.

18:49.336 --> 18:53.006
<i> Pati, </i>this is Manish.
He's Devi's favorite teacher.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.009
Where did you grow up?
What do your parents do?

18:56.093 --> 19:01.390
Well, I grew up in central Arkansas
until my parents got divorced. Ruh-roh.

19:01.473 --> 19:04.059
And then my mom moved
to Myrtle Beach to run a nightclub.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.937
And then my dad remarried
a white woman in Baton Rouge,

19:07.020 --> 19:10.524
and now they run an Etsy store
selling Grateful Dead sweatshirts.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.943
Kamala, get the hose!

19:13.026 --> 19:16.071
<i>Pati</i>, stop it.
He'll understand you.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.115
Feel free
to say whatever you want.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.117
I don't speak any Indian languages.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.452
Oh.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.621
-Oh.
<i>-Pati?</i>

19:25.706 --> 19:28.500
-Oh my God.
-Oh my God! She's having a heart attack.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.128
-Wait, no, Nalini.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.839
It might not be.
I know this juice shop very well.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.758
She had the mango namaslay,
and that has maca in it.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.344
Thank you, Rhyah, but I'm a doctor.
So I will take it from here.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.554
We're calling an ambulance.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.723
Maca's a stimulant.
Let me just try one thing.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.517
If it doesn't work, we can take her
to the hospital in 30 seconds.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.768
Open your mouth.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.854
-Ah.
-Good.

19:49.897 --> 19:50.898
Oh.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.651
-I feel better.
-You feel better?

19:55.235 --> 19:56.528
Your pulse is better.

19:58.989 --> 19:59.907
What did you just do?

19:59.990 --> 20:04.328
Just a little acupressure
and a calming elixir that I whipped up.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.997
Thank you. Truly.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.750
Okay! I think this is a great time

20:09.833 --> 20:12.794
to just wrap this all up
and say good night.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.380
Hey, um,

20:16.423 --> 20:21.511
that was a really weird date for me,
but would you want to do it again

20:22.638 --> 20:24.139
but without the crowd?

20:24.806 --> 20:25.891
I would.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.104
I understand, sweetie,
but we have to talk about this.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.774
You're mad at me for speaking my truth?

20:33.857 --> 20:37.027
We're mad because you told a girl
in your fashion program

20:37.110 --> 20:38.153
that her designs were ugly.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.449
She stitched reverse pleats
into a burgundy knit.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.159
It was disgusting.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.620
But that doesn't give you the right
to make someone feel bad.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.372
But she's the worst.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.375
She called me a turd yesterday. A turd!

20:51.458 --> 20:53.543
Whoa. Who called you a turd?
I'll kill her.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.546
No one's killing anyone.
Unless it's with kindness.

20:57.297 --> 21:00.050
Rebecca, sweetheart,
I'm not saying this girl's perfect,

21:00.133 --> 21:01.677
but you're a young woman now.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.763
This is the time you decide
what kind of person you wanna be,

21:04.846 --> 21:08.183
and you don't wanna be someone
that doesn't own up to her mistakes.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.644
Fine. I'll say I'm sorry,

21:11.228 --> 21:13.814
but the bigger mistake here
is still those pleats.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.491
-Hi.
-Hey.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.205
So, I'll apologize to Haley.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.834
-You will?
-Yeah, I shouldn't have done that to her.

21:33.917 --> 21:37.004
I was immature
and wasn't ready for anything serious,

21:37.087 --> 21:38.755
but I was a coward about it.

21:38.839 --> 21:39.881
So I ghosted her.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.885
I promise I'll make it right.

21:50.934 --> 21:51.977
Thank you.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.024
So,

21:57.566 --> 21:59.776
I think the mixer was a success,

21:59.860 --> 22:02.112
except for the part
we thought you were dying.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.281
Devi's teacher asked me on a date.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.657
No, not him.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.868
What? What's wrong with Manish?

22:07.951 --> 22:11.663
He's employed. He's handsome. He's Indian.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.873
He looks Indian,

22:12.956 --> 22:15.459
but he has the soul of Seth Rogen
and none of the charm.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.086
He's thoughtful and kind.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.048
And yet he made no effort
to touch my feet.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.343
The astronaut touched them three times,
and he has touched space.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.011
Manish is American.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.512
I don't think we should dismiss him

22:27.596 --> 22:29.639
just because
he wasn't raised to be so traditional.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.141
Oh, great.

22:31.224 --> 22:34.102
I'm glad his family
was happy to throw away a culture

22:34.186 --> 22:36.313
passed down for a thousand generations.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.066
What?

22:41.943 --> 22:42.903
You can do this.

22:45.781 --> 22:46.615
Okay.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.536
Haley, could I talk to you?

22:54.915 --> 22:56.083
What do you want?

22:56.166 --> 22:59.503
I'm just really, really sorry
for what I did to you.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.671
I don't have an excuse.

23:01.755 --> 23:05.675
I… I was a dumbass,
and I shouldn't have done that to you.

23:07.260 --> 23:10.722
-If you don't forgive me, I understand--
-Wait, are you apologizing to Haley?

23:10.806 --> 23:12.599
Because you know
you dicked me over too, right?

23:13.266 --> 23:16.019
We made out at homecoming,
and then you never talked to me again.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.604
Oh, yeah.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.981
I-I'm sorry about that, Meghan.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.651
Th-Th-That was also shitty of me.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.278
Handy at the planetarium.
Ring any bells?

23:26.071 --> 23:28.240
-Wow. Hey.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.534
Sorry.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.536
Wow. Everyone's here. Okay.

23:34.871 --> 23:35.956
Hi.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.709
<i>With three minutes left</i>
<i>on the clock, the score is tied. 2-2!</i>

23:41.503 --> 23:43.338
Oh yeah! That's good move right there.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.548
There we go!

23:47.175 --> 23:49.594
-That's all right!
-It's all right, Crickets! Go!

23:49.678 --> 23:52.806
-Yeah, Aneesa!
-<i>What an exhilarating game!</i>

23:54.933 --> 23:56.768
<i> A Whistlesclusive!</i>

23:56.852 --> 23:59.187
<i>Paxton Hall-Yoshida</i>
<i>is currently apologizing</i>

23:59.271 --> 24:01.189
<i>to every girl he's ever wronged.</i>

24:01.273 --> 24:03.233
<i>It's the biggest thing</i>
<i>to hit Sherman Oaks High</i>

24:03.316 --> 24:06.820
<i>since Coach Noble</i>
<i>barfed up Fireball at the pep rally.</i>

24:07.529 --> 24:09.823
<i>Holy shit, David. Did you do this?</i>

24:09.906 --> 24:10.866
Here we go!

24:14.035 --> 24:16.997
<i> Yup, LOL.</i>
<i>I guess I'm a feminist icon now?</i>

24:21.710 --> 24:22.794
Go, Aneesa!

24:26.006 --> 24:28.258
<i>Okay, slow your roll, AOC.</i>

24:28.758 --> 24:31.303
<i>Sherman Oaks wins 3-2!</i>

24:31.803 --> 24:35.599
<i>All but one person in the stands</i>
<i>was cheering for Aneesa,</i>

24:35.682 --> 24:38.894
<i>and she had a pretty good idea</i>
<i>who he was texting with.</i>

24:39.895 --> 24:41.313
You are also right.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.190
I-I'm sorry. That's my bad.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.322
Although, we've always had a nice vibe,

24:50.405 --> 24:54.326
I'm getting tired of scrubbing your name
off the stalls in the girls' bathroom.

24:54.409 --> 24:57.204
I'm sorry about that, Janitor Stacey.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.538
Thanks, Paxton.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.415
-That means a lot.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.586
Okay. I think that's everybody.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.672
For the record,
this is not how I saw this going.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.174
No, no, no, don't apologize.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.801
I'm apparently the one
who was an asshole to people.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.971
You know, I'm actually glad
you made me do that.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.640
It felt good to make things right.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.729
-So, you want to get some food?
-The answer is always yes.

25:22.812 --> 25:25.524
<i>Devi was proud of herself.</i>
<i>Look at her.</i>

25:25.607 --> 25:28.151
<i>She had basically healed the school.</i>

25:28.235 --> 25:29.861
You know what? One second.

25:31.404 --> 25:34.157
Yo, Haley, we're gonna hit up Jinky's.
You want to come?

25:34.241 --> 25:35.116
Really?

25:35.200 --> 25:36.159
Yeah.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.453
Yeah. I'd love to.

25:38.995 --> 25:42.165
I actually haven't been to Jinky's
since that last time we went.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.709
-Oh damn! I forgot about that.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.545
Are you sure you're not still banned?

25:46.628 --> 25:48.004
Maybe they won't recognize me.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.090
<i> Whoa. What the hell was this?</i>

25:50.173 --> 25:52.717
<i>He apologized to you. Now back off!</i>

25:52.801 --> 25:55.470
<i>Devi, no!</i>
<i>You're making the jealous nerd face.</i>

25:55.554 --> 25:57.597
<i>Stop! You'll get wrinkles.</i>

26:02.435 --> 26:04.646
Tuesdays are usually my leg day,

26:04.729 --> 26:07.440
but, uh, today
I didn't really have the time. Sorry.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.984
Hey! Congratulations.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.318
What an awesome game!

26:10.402 --> 26:12.696
Uh… Yeah, it's crazy we won.

26:13.196 --> 26:15.115
It really came down to that last play.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.576
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that was,

26:18.493 --> 26:19.369
like, unreal.

26:19.452 --> 26:22.122
You know, I was like,
"I can't believe what I'm seeing."

26:22.706 --> 26:26.876
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I can't believe it either.
I'm actually gonna pop in the bathroom.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.212
Oh, okay. Yeah, sure.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.756
Well, I'll… I'll text you later.
Congrats again.

26:42.058 --> 26:44.769
<i>Aneesa wasn't upset</i>
<i>that Ben had ignored her.</i>

26:45.270 --> 26:46.938
<i>It was that he didn't get her.</i>

26:47.022 --> 26:48.857
<i>She just wanted to feel seen.</i>

26:53.153 --> 26:54.154
Aneesa!

26:54.237 --> 26:57.198
Oh my God, that was such a great game,

26:57.282 --> 26:59.659
and you were unbelievable.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.911
Like such a superstar.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.831
And the way that you faked out
that mean-looking girl,

27:04.914 --> 27:08.960
and then swerved around that other girl,
and then slammed the ball into the net.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.838
As a person who loves physics,
it was thrilling.

27:11.921 --> 27:14.716
And you! I mean, I'm amazed by you.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.093
You were brilliant.
